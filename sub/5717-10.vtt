00:03.086 --> 00:04.914
I said no !
OH !

00:05.875 --> 00:07.500
No one says no to me !

00:09.504 --> 00:11.203
I think you should slow down.

00:11.566 --> 00:12.714
This isn't like you.

00:12.726 --> 00:14.804
There's obviously something
you're not telling me.

00:14.836 --> 00:16.373
Hysterectomy at 15.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.148
The uterine wall's perforated.

00:19.359 --> 00:20.856
The man was a butcher.

00:21.406 --> 00:22.788
Ruptured appendix.

00:23.390 --> 00:26.812
I thought 'miscarriage' was the usual
euphemism on the death certificate.

00:28.836 --> 00:31.109
Well, I just met the
new owner of Stardust.

00:31.175 --> 00:33.050
Do you have any idea,
what that horse is worth?

00:33.058 --> 00:34.698
Stardust is MY horse !

00:35.679 --> 00:39.761
What was once his pride, now
seems like plain stubbornness.

00:39.769 --> 00:41.323
This is a princess, slumming it.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.210
Give it to me, that's my work !

00:43.218 --> 00:44.765
Anna, hey Anna !

00:45.894 --> 00:47.308
Sweetheart, what..?

00:48.359 --> 00:50.609
You came all this way, just
to give me a clipping?

00:50.687 --> 00:53.823
No, no. To ask you,
to run away with me.

00:54.449 --> 00:55.327
Henry.

00:56.182 --> 00:59.273
I feel like I can talk to you,
like I can't talk to anyone else.

00:59.371 --> 01:01.612
That day, Rene
Nordmann shot you,

01:01.871 --> 01:04.253
He was intent.
He wanted to kill you.

01:04.331 --> 01:07.612
So, is this a proposal
or a business deal?

01:07.636 --> 01:08.589
Both.

01:08.675 --> 01:12.558
You do realise that a marriage of
this nature, can be easily annulled?

01:12.566 --> 01:14.558
Rene Nordmann passed away.

01:15.570 --> 01:18.640
No matter how charitable
you may feel towards me,

01:18.656 --> 01:21.241
or to the baby, we WILL be on our own.

01:21.265 --> 01:22.626
It won't be charity.

01:23.363 --> 01:28.464
To Sarah Nordmann, I give, devise and
bequeath, finances held in trust,

01:28.777 --> 01:30.818
on behalf of our unborn child.

01:33.601 --> 01:34.948
That's his favourite.

02:27.425 --> 02:28.487
Regina ?

02:42.726 --> 02:43.718
George.

02:45.007 --> 02:46.132
Darling ?

03:22.407 --> 03:25.215
George, good morning.

03:26.449 --> 03:28.746
Last night was such
a lovely surprise.

03:29.258 --> 03:31.766
You were so masterful.

03:32.540 --> 03:35.438
We make a great team, George.
In every situation.

03:35.454 --> 03:38.797
It was inappropriate,
given the circumstances.

03:39.356 --> 03:40.660
It won't happen again.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.188
When you get back, we can go over
your hospital speech, if you wish.

03:44.235 --> 03:45.809
Ah, there you are.

03:46.770 --> 03:48.063
Good morning mother.

03:48.422 --> 03:50.461
- George, if I may have a word.
- I'm rather busy.

03:50.477 --> 03:52.586
I'm sure you are. Anna is here.

03:53.211 --> 03:53.967
How lovely.

03:53.993 --> 03:56.259
Well, she and Gino
have had an argument.

03:56.899 --> 03:58.016
She's with Carolyn.

03:58.352 --> 04:00.597
- Is she alright?
- She will be.

04:01.215 --> 04:02.211
What about you?

04:02.977 --> 04:05.154
I didn't sleep well, that's all.

04:08.032 --> 04:09.551
Come on, sleepy head.

04:10.692 --> 04:14.621
Right, this bed's too comfortable.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.906
Sweetheart.

04:24.629 --> 04:26.551
You can't hide from this.

04:29.129 --> 04:31.012
You need to stand
up for yourself.

04:32.168 --> 04:34.558
I thought that marriage
would be like...

04:35.356 --> 04:36.906
"Pride and Prejudice",

04:37.493 --> 04:39.125
or "A Room with a View".

04:39.911 --> 04:42.291
Everyone living
happily ever after.

04:43.114 --> 04:44.406
You still love him.

04:45.407 --> 04:47.812
You and papa love each other,
but you're not even talking.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.226
Let's leave Jack out of this.

04:49.563 --> 04:51.672
The same with father and Sarah.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.754
Love it's...
it's no guarantee.

04:57.844 --> 04:59.976
So, you're gonna hide
from the future in here?

04:59.985 --> 05:02.750
- Under the covers?
- No.

05:03.297 --> 05:07.243
You know, one day I'm going to
earn my own living as a writer.

05:08.110 --> 05:09.062
Just like you.

05:12.322 --> 05:14.610
Well, so many writers
in the family.

05:16.427 --> 05:19.352
Won't the Bronte sisters be jealous?
Hmhm.

05:28.493 --> 05:34.098
Mr. Bligh, launching his
campaign, here with us.

05:34.474 --> 05:36.548
We're so lucky, don't you think?

05:36.587 --> 05:37.799
Look at you.

05:38.688 --> 05:41.057
Never seen you look so pretty.

05:41.876 --> 05:43.237
Pretty as a picture.

05:45.716 --> 05:47.281
Very nice thing to say.

05:47.450 --> 05:49.491
Oh, credit where credit's due.

05:50.228 --> 05:52.751
Really scrub up alright for
an old girl, don't you?

05:54.533 --> 05:55.930
Goodness, look at the time.

05:57.470 --> 05:59.103
I'll be needed indoors.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.223
Sister Carlin?

06:05.450 --> 06:08.387
Could you please take Mrs Clark's
blood pressure more frequently?

06:08.404 --> 06:10.853
I'm concerned, she's
developing preeclampsia

06:10.982 --> 06:12.442
May I speak frankly?

06:13.181 --> 06:15.766
Not all the patients
feel comfortable,

06:16.298 --> 06:18.235
with you in mourning, and so on.

06:18.486 --> 06:19.427
And so on?

06:19.892 --> 06:21.548
With you in the family way?

06:21.900 --> 06:22.920
Which patients?

06:23.345 --> 06:25.227
Give me their names,
I'll have a quiet word.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.197
There's no need for that.

06:26.213 --> 06:27.845
Oh, let's go and talk to
them together, shall we?

06:27.869 --> 06:30.931
Because I can guarantee that most
of them worked in their paddocks

06:30.947 --> 06:32.423
until they were ready to drop.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.571
So, I'm a bit surprised.

06:34.821 --> 06:37.078
It's men, who put
these demeaning

06:37.104 --> 06:39.102
ideas into people's heads.

06:39.195 --> 06:41.626
We women know, what
we're capable off.

06:42.284 --> 06:44.143
If you focused on
your job, Marjorie

06:44.151 --> 06:46.455
you really would be a
much better nurse.

06:59.932 --> 07:01.736
I know, what you're gonna say.

07:03.182 --> 07:05.699
Perhaps it's too soon,
to come back.

07:05.772 --> 07:08.029
In my condition, you've
joined the enemy.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.775
It's not just about the pregnancy.

07:12.108 --> 07:13.741
I need to be here, Jack.

07:16.346 --> 07:17.041
Alright.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.730
You just take things slowly, hm?

07:29.397 --> 07:30.873
You should have been there.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.027
The strings were sublime.

07:35.186 --> 07:37.626
Apparently, Eugene
Goossens may well get

07:37.652 --> 07:40.031
his Opera House built,
according to the radio.

07:42.940 --> 07:43.916
Lizzie ?

07:45.213 --> 07:46.088
Ow ...

07:46.979 --> 07:49.236
.. do forgive me.
My mind was elsewhere.

07:49.541 --> 07:51.713
Well, if you want to unburden?

07:52.920 --> 07:55.264
It's good of you to come and
tell me about the concert.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.053
I do value your
friendship, you know.

07:59.362 --> 08:00.127
Actually,

08:00.838 --> 08:02.199
that's why I'm here.

08:02.452 --> 08:04.153
Cause I've been thinking.

08:05.112 --> 08:07.221
I don't want to be your friend.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.096
Oh, I see.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.166
I want us to be more
than just friends.

08:13.862 --> 08:14.783
Why not ?

08:15.979 --> 08:18.932
Why don't we go
away together, hm ?

08:20.174 --> 08:22.228
You want to see this
archeology first hand?

08:22.752 --> 08:25.896
Other people visit the Middle East.
Why don't we?

08:27.819 --> 08:29.928
Douglas, this is most improper.

08:31.374 --> 08:33.006
What would people think?

08:33.784 --> 08:34.284
Ah !

08:35.174 --> 08:37.078
Well, we can go in disguise.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.833
As a camel. You can go as the
front, I'll go as the back. Hm ?

08:41.081 --> 08:42.732
Don't be ridiculous !

08:42.788 --> 08:45.193
Why, you think people might
catch on, eventually ?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.814
Lizzie, life is so short.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.224
Why don't we just
suck the marrow

08:51.250 --> 08:53.038
out of it, while we still can.

08:53.578 --> 08:56.960
- My family.
- They don't need you, like I do.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.156
Keep it.

09:01.563 --> 09:04.101
We have to be at the airport
7pm tomorrow night.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.566
I'll call by the
Sydney apartment

09:05.601 --> 09:08.215
5pm tomorrow afternoon,
if you're not there...

09:09.278 --> 09:11.707
.. I'll take it, our
chapter is concluded.

09:13.321 --> 09:17.359
If you are, you make me a
very happy man, indeed.

09:39.805 --> 09:42.512
They just need to sort
things out for themselves.

09:43.668 --> 09:44.980
Ah, Mr Goddard.

09:45.637 --> 09:48.285
Back again !?
What a lovely surprise.

09:48.809 --> 09:52.199
I hope, mother isn't wearing you
out, with all this driving.

09:52.247 --> 09:53.863
Mr Goddard was just leaving.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.092
Why don't you stay for lunch ?

09:56.325 --> 09:58.973
George is off, campaigning,
but we'd love to have you.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.000
I- I couldnâ€™t impose.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.625
That's no imposition.
Is it, mother ?

10:05.266 --> 10:08.504
Then again, cook can be an awful , when
these things are sprung on to her.

10:08.528 --> 10:10.996
- Another time ?
- Let's hope so.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.668
I'll ehm...

10:13.348 --> 10:14.845
.. take my leave then.

10:15.911 --> 10:18.402
- I'll see you out.
- Oh, thank you.

10:21.649 --> 10:23.146
Did something happen ?

10:24.036 --> 10:27.449
Oh, this notion, that one's
every thought needs expressing.

10:28.348 --> 10:30.840
Yes. heaven forbid,
anyone having a truthful

10:30.866 --> 10:32.870
human reaction to
anything, mother !

10:42.659 --> 10:44.687
Anna, are you sure about this ?

10:44.713 --> 10:46.584
Oh yeah, these will
be fine, until I get

10:46.610 --> 10:48.230
the rest of my things
out of the attic.

10:48.377 --> 10:49.892
Is there a horse for me ?

10:50.272 --> 10:51.373
Of course.

10:52.138 --> 10:54.836
I meant, about staying
on at Ash Park.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.359
I hate seeing you like this,
so I'm gonna go talk..

10:56.365 --> 10:58.542
Please don't James,
just let things be.

11:04.791 --> 11:06.338
I'm glad you're home.

11:08.198 --> 11:10.228
We miss you, when
you're in Sydney.

11:10.881 --> 11:12.037
Well, it's like Henry says.

11:12.063 --> 11:14.053
It's a hard job, but
some one's got to do it.

11:19.151 --> 11:21.236
You've become such good
friends, haven't you ?

11:21.315 --> 11:22.681
Well, that's all we are.

11:23.408 --> 11:24.345
Friends !

11:28.256 --> 11:31.486
And it's high time,
regions like Inverness,

11:31.854 --> 11:34.724
enjoy the same benefits,
as the cities.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.621
Such as modern ambulance care.

11:37.666 --> 11:40.736
Now, some country areas
still lack this amenity.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.431
I had need, recently, of
the ambulance service,

11:43.457 --> 11:45.541
and fortunately, it
happened to be available.

11:45.857 --> 11:48.020
And it certainly helped,
to save my life.

11:48.701 --> 11:52.669
This gave me cause to
reflect, on what matters.

11:54.045 --> 11:57.967
Now, in the lead-up to this election,
you'll hear a lot of talk about the

11:58.099 --> 12:00.880
the state of our economy,
in relation to the nation,

12:00.923 --> 12:04.801
inflation, and so forth, but
when you look at your lives,

12:05.337 --> 12:07.922
in two, five, ten
years time, and you

12:08.134 --> 12:12.080
you see where they might be,
what is it that matters most.

12:18.473 --> 12:19.676
Well, surely...

12:20.418 --> 12:21.680
it has to be...

12:22.125 --> 12:24.062
the people in our lives...

12:24.563 --> 12:25.976
our families...

12:27.750 --> 12:28.945
those we love.

12:31.578 --> 12:33.742
The confidence, that
we can give them...

12:34.313 --> 12:35.461
to sustain...

12:35.903 --> 12:37.807
and build our communities...

12:38.270 --> 12:41.887
communities, that are the
backbones of this region.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.660
It's not the platform
we decided on.

12:43.692 --> 12:45.035
What's going on, Reggie ?

12:45.137 --> 12:46.981
Nothing that cannot be fixed !

12:47.684 --> 12:49.563
Don't worry, you'll
get your coalmine.

12:49.587 --> 12:52.308
..to be, your next
member of parliament.

12:54.293 --> 12:54.973
Thank you.

12:56.843 --> 12:57.757
Thank you !

13:03.668 --> 13:07.253
Mr Bligh, our patients
would so love to meet you.

13:07.261 --> 13:09.066
Apology, such a big schedule.

13:09.129 --> 13:11.170
- It'll be my pleasure.
- Oh.

13:11.574 --> 13:12.761
Marty !

13:13.035 --> 13:15.284
This is Mr George Bligh.

13:15.363 --> 13:18.764
- You been in the wars ?
- Little closer, sister.

13:23.301 --> 13:25.478
Isn't sister Nordmann a marvel ?

13:26.161 --> 13:29.598
I think, if anything is keeping her
upright, it's MY handmade tonic.

13:30.278 --> 13:31.465
Is that so ?

13:37.507 --> 13:40.084
I cannot understand, why you
would take such a risk.

13:41.428 --> 13:44.107
I'll speak with Sir Richard
about my priorities.

13:44.912 --> 13:46.927
The way you looked
at her, it was obvious.

13:47.654 --> 13:48.833
This feeling.

13:49.810 --> 13:51.412
You're still in love with her.

13:52.635 --> 13:55.152
My feelings are none
of your concern.

14:26.900 --> 14:32.352
To Sarah Nordmann, I give, devise and
bequeath, finances held in trust,

14:32.435 --> 14:35.700
on behalf of our unborn
child, for maintenance,

14:35.726 --> 14:40.324
education, advancement and
benefit, reaching the age of 21.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.288
One should always be up,
for new experiences.

15:00.624 --> 15:02.325
Get out, just leave it !!

15:05.023 --> 15:06.542
What on earth is going on ?

15:06.568 --> 15:07.722
You'll have to ask Mrs Bligh.

15:07.730 --> 15:08.667
Regina !

15:08.729 --> 15:10.190
Patrolling the halls.

15:10.355 --> 15:12.328
How Dickensian, even for you.

15:12.363 --> 15:14.776
Respect of you, Regina,
is not going to be easy.

15:14.785 --> 15:15.925
You mean my marriage?

15:16.363 --> 15:17.656
To the man I love ?

15:17.785 --> 15:20.370
And who loves me, in every way !

15:21.622 --> 15:25.161
Yes, your hopes of annulment
have been dashed.

15:26.122 --> 15:28.516
In a quite spectacular fashion.

15:29.446 --> 15:31.079
Then you have
everything you want.

15:31.696 --> 15:33.329
But still not satisfied.

15:33.552 --> 15:35.614
- According to who ?
- I see you.

15:36.614 --> 15:38.934
Regina, I see who you are.

15:39.255 --> 15:40.981
You are a wanton woman.

15:41.243 --> 15:43.469
How sad you are.

15:43.825 --> 15:47.020
The way you cling to
this life, this family.

15:47.036 --> 15:49.614
But only, because you
have nothing else.

15:49.653 --> 15:51.774
You're the one, who
doesn't belong here.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.298
You're the one, who
has no place !

16:08.952 --> 16:10.517
Your speech went well ?

16:11.569 --> 16:13.678
It was a clarifying experience.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.538
Is there something
on your mind ?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.854
George, I want you to
promise me, to be careful,

16:22.948 --> 16:25.440
with Regina, she is so
dangerously willful.

16:25.456 --> 16:27.709
I'm not blind to
Regina's ambitions.

16:27.976 --> 16:29.948
You needn't worry about that.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.795
It was nice to see Douglas
back here, so soon.

16:35.521 --> 16:36.982
You're changing the subject.

16:36.990 --> 16:38.419
Attentive, isn't he ?

16:39.584 --> 16:41.728
He does tend toward
the spontaneous.

16:42.353 --> 16:44.122
How awful for you, mother.

16:46.295 --> 16:48.427
And he's rather too
fond of Tchaikovsky.

16:50.053 --> 16:51.490
He makes you happy.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.639
Douglas is a wonderful man.

16:55.451 --> 16:57.349
And we all deserve a
little happiness.

16:58.842 --> 17:00.202
That's what HE says.

17:01.275 --> 17:02.636
It's never too late.

17:20.136 --> 17:21.497
Working hard, Gino ?

17:22.455 --> 17:23.737
Go home, James.

17:26.355 --> 17:28.811
Look, I know what Anna's like.

17:29.241 --> 17:30.647
She's hardheaded and practical.

17:30.674 --> 17:31.822
She can't be told anything.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.514
Don't talk about her like that.

17:34.558 --> 17:37.034
That's fine, she's my sister.
I know her.

17:38.741 --> 17:40.358
Please, Gino.

17:41.058 --> 17:42.862
Put things right with
her, be a good husband.

17:43.288 --> 17:44.952
You're lecturing me
on being a husband?

17:45.007 --> 17:45.921
That's rich.

17:46.741 --> 17:48.136
What's that supposed to mean ?

17:48.417 --> 17:49.506
Forget about it.

17:50.304 --> 17:51.975
No, I'm trying to talk to you and

17:51.976 --> 17:53.561
you don't even have the
decency, to look me in the eye.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.475
- Look, just leave !
- NO !

17:56.116 --> 17:58.155
You used to be so easy-going,
we've always got along.

17:58.163 --> 17:59.421
Tell me what's changed.

18:00.036 --> 18:01.260
I married a Bligh.

18:01.458 --> 18:02.442
And that's such a hardship ?

18:02.466 --> 18:03.762
To be married to Anna, no.

18:04.130 --> 18:06.511
- All that comes with it.
- What ?

18:07.997 --> 18:08.793
What are you talking about?

18:08.802 --> 18:10.711
The lies, the secrets.
No wonder people write

18:10.737 --> 18:12.396
such terrible things
about your family.

18:12.643 --> 18:13.527
What things ?

18:17.170 --> 18:19.279
Swanson wrote a letter to Anna.

18:20.428 --> 18:22.741
About you, your
wife and your son.

18:23.026 --> 18:23.939
My son ?

18:25.932 --> 18:27.089
This is nonsense.

18:28.873 --> 18:31.053
Alright, what did that pig
Swanson say about him ?

18:31.233 --> 18:32.593
That he's not yours.

18:34.163 --> 18:35.659
Well, that's not true.

18:43.577 --> 18:46.021
You make amends with my sister,
or you'll answer to me.

19:02.081 --> 19:03.658
There you are.

19:07.538 --> 19:08.326
James ?

19:13.768 --> 19:15.333
Whatever's the matter ?

19:18.530 --> 19:21.435
- James ?
- I just saw Gino.

19:22.416 --> 19:24.457
Swanson's letter, is it true ?

19:25.807 --> 19:27.932
They say, men like me
can't father a child.

19:27.963 --> 19:30.373
Is Georgie mine ?!

19:30.690 --> 19:32.650
- Why would you ever..
- Tell me !!

19:34.850 --> 19:37.842
How can you even question that ?

19:37.858 --> 19:39.217
You slept with Lloyd
behind my back.

19:39.233 --> 19:41.119
Perhaps you have a
talent for deception.

19:42.002 --> 19:46.158
And so you would trust Andrew
Swanson's word over mine ?

19:46.678 --> 19:48.732
After everything
we've been through ?

19:51.952 --> 19:54.170
Is that how little
you think of me ?

19:55.561 --> 19:57.170
James, this is ludicrous.

19:57.186 --> 19:59.975
Of course Georgie is yours.
He's OUR little boy.

20:00.186 --> 20:01.225
JAMES !

20:10.713 --> 20:11.611
Truce.

20:18.264 --> 20:19.829
You're not joining me ?

20:21.342 --> 20:22.240
Why not .

20:30.452 --> 20:32.326
In the car, we argued.

20:33.084 --> 20:34.393
I regret that.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.166
To teething problems.

20:45.815 --> 20:47.720
You do trust me, don't you ?

20:48.573 --> 20:51.334
If you're having second
thoughts about our arrangement ?

20:51.674 --> 20:54.041
Sarah Nordmann was not
part of our arrangement.

20:54.057 --> 20:55.350
I've made it clear.

20:59.147 --> 21:00.826
Don't see her again.

21:03.967 --> 21:05.029
Please ?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.252
There can only be two of
us, in this marriage.

21:13.502 --> 21:14.799
If it were to come out...

21:15.877 --> 21:17.463
If what were to come out ?

21:19.330 --> 21:20.689
Think of your career.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.260
The scandal, you would
be a laughing stock.

21:23.495 --> 21:24.650
People talk.

21:25.924 --> 21:27.736
Who would tell these people ?

21:28.198 --> 21:29.182
If you're suggesting...

21:29.206 --> 21:31.150
I will NOT be blackmailed
by my wife !

21:31.174 --> 21:32.195
That is NOT it.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.510
Your mother has been in your
ear, poisoning you against me.

21:35.518 --> 21:37.385
My mother is not the
poisoning type.

21:39.940 --> 21:43.424
You, will play the role,
that you have chosen.

21:44.241 --> 21:46.607
You will smile and wave,
and do what is asked.

21:47.241 --> 21:49.975
And in return, you'll enjoy the
benefits of your position.

21:50.909 --> 21:52.881
But you will not question me.

21:54.596 --> 21:57.268
Nor will you plot and connive
against Mrs. Nordmann.

21:57.721 --> 21:59.422
Whatever your grievances.

22:00.182 --> 22:01.217
Is that understood ?

22:01.264 --> 22:03.225
- George..
- Is that understood !!?

22:03.944 --> 22:04.615
Yes.

22:06.334 --> 22:07.083
Very well.

22:23.081 --> 22:25.666
I'm so glad, you've
resumed your work.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.701
I'm sure, it's for the best.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.627
Mind you, it wouldn't
have happened in my day.

22:31.678 --> 22:32.928
It wouldn't have been allowed.

22:32.980 --> 22:35.089
Confinement meant exactly that.

22:36.178 --> 22:37.924
Women have more choices now.

22:38.893 --> 22:40.635
Not as many, as we might like.

22:41.143 --> 22:43.627
And few supported,
even by other women.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.096
But still, you do
exactly as you see fit.

22:47.260 --> 22:49.232
Regardless of what others think.

22:49.678 --> 22:50.853
As do you.

22:52.776 --> 22:54.477
Like this possible trip ?

22:55.881 --> 22:58.534
And yes, your immunisations
are up to date.

22:58.858 --> 23:01.248
Including cholera and typhoid ?

23:03.123 --> 23:05.708
Are you thinking of
somewhere exotic ?

23:06.295 --> 23:07.248
Perhaps.

23:08.452 --> 23:10.629
I do worry about leaving George.

23:10.991 --> 23:13.295
He needs so much
support, at the moment.

23:13.889 --> 23:15.590
He has his wife for that.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.205
From someone he can trust.

23:19.350 --> 23:21.420
George was raised
by you, Elizabeth.

23:22.303 --> 23:24.412
He'll make the right decisions.

23:25.377 --> 23:26.455
Eventually.

23:28.702 --> 23:29.529
Perhaps.

23:32.483 --> 23:33.326
Gino !

23:34.721 --> 23:35.408
Anna.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.846
Olivia told me, what
you said to James.

23:39.389 --> 23:41.084
How could you do that ?

23:41.476 --> 23:43.140
Do you know what
you have done to them

23:43.166 --> 23:45.312
and how horrible it is ?

23:46.117 --> 23:47.522
There is no excuse.

23:47.976 --> 23:49.015
I was angry.

23:51.277 --> 23:53.167
I don't expect you,
to forgive me.

23:54.187 --> 23:56.491
But Anna, bella, wait.

24:08.550 --> 24:09.605
Hey...

24:12.004 --> 24:12.980
I'm sorry.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.167
I am so... so sorry.

24:20.312 --> 24:23.306
I made so many mistakes
with us, with James.

24:29.004 --> 24:30.500
But I love you, bella.

24:32.242 --> 24:33.535
More than anything.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.574
We were so happy, once.

24:37.367 --> 24:38.663
Can't we be again ?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.538
I don't know how ?

25:12.203 --> 25:13.874
I thought we were
meeting at the club.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.079
I was in the neighborhood, so..

25:18.306 --> 25:19.150
Drink ?

25:20.115 --> 25:21.786
Thank you, you read my mind.

25:23.131 --> 25:24.967
Well, we can talk about it.

25:27.341 --> 25:29.518
Or NOT talk about it, up to you.

25:31.607 --> 25:33.013
I wouldn't know where to start.

25:35.736 --> 25:37.399
How about at the
bottom of this ?

25:48.427 --> 25:49.992
I might seem quite mad.

25:50.228 --> 25:51.180
Stark, raving.

25:53.455 --> 25:54.679
I had to get away.

25:56.408 --> 25:57.696
And here you are.

25:58.541 --> 26:00.790
It's all getting a bit on
top of me, I'm afraid.

26:01.166 --> 26:01.931
What is ?

26:05.705 --> 26:07.778
The world is not
gonna end, James.

26:08.380 --> 26:09.469
Just let it out.

26:10.341 --> 26:11.817
Just, let it out !

27:24.336 --> 27:27.199
It has been brought to
the Chamber's attention,

27:27.208 --> 27:30.745
that you may have been
involved in unlawful conduct,

27:30.907 --> 27:33.968
with intend to administer
an illegal abortion,

27:34.018 --> 27:37.375
resulting in the untimely
death, of a patient.

27:49.514 --> 27:51.373
Bella mia, bella ragazze.

27:52.826 --> 27:54.068
Toast, cafÃ©.

27:55.603 --> 27:57.644
I can't believe I fell asleep.

27:59.213 --> 28:01.254
I missed waking up next to you.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.869
Let's never be apart like that.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.877
No, we can't go on
fighting, as we have.

28:07.963 --> 28:08.752
We won't.

28:09.541 --> 28:12.398
No more arguing about
money, or anything.

28:12.854 --> 28:15.631
I was thinking that we could sell
Stardust, to pay back Carlo.

28:15.655 --> 28:17.123
Anna, I know what
she means to you.

28:17.147 --> 28:19.052
But it's time to be practical.

28:21.149 --> 28:23.672
I'll talk to papa, about
mortgaging the farm.

28:23.698 --> 28:26.502
Forget about it, time being.
No Gino !

28:26.580 --> 28:28.986
Don't, Poletti wise
it's a good dream.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.353
I talk to George about investing.
Make him a partner.

28:33.362 --> 28:35.267
Oh really ?
You'd do that ?

28:36.033 --> 28:37.462
I think he'd love it.

28:38.006 --> 28:39.396
We'll do things properly.

28:40.123 --> 28:42.028
Maybe I'll even take advice.

28:45.471 --> 28:47.607
I just want us to make
each other happy.

28:48.069 --> 28:50.275
Tell me what I gotta do,
I do anything, bella.

28:50.451 --> 28:51.771
You have to keep talking,

28:52.018 --> 28:54.334
Okay, being honest
like we are now.

28:55.717 --> 28:57.564
As long as we're together,
we'll be happy.

28:59.353 --> 29:00.134
Yes ?

29:01.396 --> 29:02.060
Yes.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.368
Were you planning
on leaving a note ?

29:34.439 --> 29:35.892
I really should go.

29:45.681 --> 29:46.615
Here I am.

29:49.658 --> 29:52.548
Carolyn, what would
you say, if I...

29:53.525 --> 29:55.838
..if I told you, I
might go away ?

29:56.006 --> 29:57.021
On a trip.

29:58.119 --> 29:59.759
Send me a postcard ?

30:02.670 --> 30:03.794
Luxor ?

30:04.935 --> 30:07.005
With Mr Goddard.
Douglas.

30:09.029 --> 30:10.669
Tell me if you think
I shouldn't go.

30:11.162 --> 30:12.868
What will happen,
if you don't go ?

30:15.377 --> 30:17.118
Oh, it's such a bold decision.

30:17.221 --> 30:18.779
They are the best.

30:19.170 --> 30:21.513
They're the ones, that
make our lives sparkle.

30:24.681 --> 30:27.403
If I were to go, would
you tell George ?

30:28.244 --> 30:29.818
He'll disapprove, I know.

30:29.842 --> 30:32.333
Mother, no matter what
anybody will think,

30:32.724 --> 30:35.322
you'll regret it so
much, if you don't go.

30:37.549 --> 30:38.759
And you'd be alright ?

30:38.799 --> 30:40.786
Yes, I promise.

30:44.447 --> 30:46.197
Mother, you wanted to see me ?

30:46.275 --> 30:49.353
I wanted to let you know,
I'm returning to Sydney.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.517
- As you wish.
- George.

30:52.857 --> 30:55.161
Be strong, stay strong.

30:56.615 --> 30:57.521
Yes, mother.

30:59.506 --> 31:02.159
Wel,l I must be going.
Thank you both.

31:13.568 --> 31:14.865
Is she alright ?

31:16.377 --> 31:18.181
I think she's on
top of the world.

31:33.681 --> 31:34.884
Come here.

31:43.428 --> 31:45.411
Let me get rid of
whoever that is.

31:49.545 --> 31:50.482
Yes !

31:53.588 --> 31:55.765
I'd like to speak to my husband.

31:59.607 --> 32:00.775
Excuse me !

32:01.349 --> 32:02.421
Mrs Bligh.

32:03.294 --> 32:04.242
Mrs Bligh !

32:13.479 --> 32:15.147
Livvie, Livvie !

32:15.218 --> 32:16.409
Livvie, WAIT !

32:16.433 --> 32:18.049
Wait, let me explain !

32:18.537 --> 32:19.998
Explain what !

32:20.069 --> 32:21.377
I never meant for
this to happen.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.182
Tell me what it is,
that you're doing here.

32:36.707 --> 32:37.402
No.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.090
No.

32:44.733 --> 32:46.983
Wait, wait, WAIT !

32:48.343 --> 32:49.123
Livvie.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.491
You can't leave like this.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.424
I need to think
about what I want.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.682
What you want ?

32:57.874 --> 32:59.819
This is MY marriage too.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.202
What is it, bella ?

33:22.444 --> 33:23.873
Just don't be angry ?

33:25.335 --> 33:26.627
I won't, I promise.

33:28.327 --> 33:29.053
Tell me.

33:29.210 --> 33:31.319
I heard back from my publisher,

33:31.413 --> 33:34.202
I didn't think, I'd
hear anything, but...

33:35.194 --> 33:36.436
Someone wants your book ?

33:37.123 --> 33:38.744
Angus & Robertson.

33:38.770 --> 33:41.614
They think I could be
the voice of young women.

33:43.061 --> 33:45.741
They want me to go down to
Sydney, to meet with them.

33:47.128 --> 33:48.741
Such an opportunity.

33:49.854 --> 33:51.557
It's going to take
a lot more work.

33:51.987 --> 33:52.795
And...

33:53.421 --> 33:54.849
.. after what I wrote

33:55.179 --> 33:56.030
about us.

33:57.542 --> 33:58.362
Bella,

33:59.093 --> 34:01.155
you do what makes
your heart sing.

34:02.733 --> 34:03.537
Really ?

34:05.530 --> 34:06.811
Thank you darling.

34:07.112 --> 34:08.541
Thank you, thank you.

34:16.045 --> 34:16.928
Carolyn.

34:19.065 --> 34:20.405
Perhaps we might talk ?

34:22.444 --> 34:23.873
I tried to telephone.

34:27.346 --> 34:28.275
I need it.

34:36.272 --> 34:38.350
I've come to talk to
you about Sir Richard.

34:39.431 --> 34:40.072
Well,

34:41.503 --> 34:42.272
I see.

34:44.675 --> 34:46.697
Now, you've certainly taken
your time, to tell me.

34:47.577 --> 34:48.597
Tell you what ?

34:49.194 --> 34:50.846
His interest was clear.

34:52.175 --> 34:53.675
Now yours is as well.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.315
No, you don't understand.

35:02.855 --> 35:05.913
That night you left my
place, something happened.

35:08.179 --> 35:08.999
He...

35:11.823 --> 35:12.393
he...

35:12.800 --> 35:15.378
.. forced himself, on me.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.778
You were right about him.

35:21.956 --> 35:23.010
I've been such a fool.

35:23.028 --> 35:24.300
This is not your fault.

35:24.397 --> 35:25.350
IT IS !!

35:25.671 --> 35:27.702
I had him in my apartment.

35:27.727 --> 35:29.249
We were drinking.

35:31.894 --> 35:34.112
He stays inside my head, and I..

35:34.128 --> 35:35.796
I can't get him out and,

35:35.812 --> 35:37.989
I don't know how to make these..

35:38.898 --> 35:40.780
scars go away !

35:43.843 --> 35:45.000
The best of me...

35:45.664 --> 35:46.757
.. has gone, Jack.

35:46.773 --> 35:49.562
The best pieces and I don't
know how to get them back.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.452
Don't touch me, please.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.108
He won't get away with it.

35:58.054 --> 35:59.058
Dr Duncan.

35:59.605 --> 36:00.722
Some men here, to see you.

36:00.748 --> 36:02.284
Yeah, not now, right ?

36:02.363 --> 36:03.745
They're detectives.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.765
Jack, what's going on?

36:20.171 --> 36:22.831
The police want a formal
interview, by the end of the week.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.050
The important thing is, we
got Jack Chand on board.

36:25.081 --> 36:26.518
Best criminal lawyer in Sydney.

36:26.527 --> 36:27.911
Even if there isn't
a criminal case to

36:27.937 --> 36:29.383
answer, my license
is still at risk.

36:29.426 --> 36:31.513
I had a word with Sir
Richard, before you arrived.

36:31.605 --> 36:32.573
I'm calling in a favour.

36:32.582 --> 36:33.620
I don't want him involved.

36:33.636 --> 36:35.027
He has valuable connections.

36:35.043 --> 36:36.034
I said no.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.007
You're asking me to help, Jack.

36:40.039 --> 36:41.351
We didn't do anything illegal.

36:41.648 --> 36:42.491
We ?

36:43.644 --> 36:45.222
You didn't mention someone else.

36:45.236 --> 36:47.128
I didn't think it was important.

36:47.293 --> 36:48.441
If there are other witnesses.

36:48.449 --> 36:50.363
No, it's too compromising,
to name them.

36:50.761 --> 36:52.122
This is your future.

36:52.945 --> 36:53.734
Jack.

36:58.718 --> 37:02.255
When Sarah Nordmann was in
Sydney, she met the girl.

37:03.491 --> 37:05.557
Met someone, having a
backyard abortion?

37:06.870 --> 37:08.299
Why would Sarah meet....

37:11.339 --> 37:12.217
Ehm...

37:13.507 --> 37:14.868
If you'll excuse me?

37:15.101 --> 37:16.006
George !

37:43.534 --> 37:46.424
I have something rather
difficult, I have to ask you.

37:50.788 --> 37:52.498
Did you ever consider having...

37:53.495 --> 37:54.583
.. an abortion ?

37:59.452 --> 38:01.663
I don't.. I don't know how
to explain this to you.

38:01.690 --> 38:04.409
How could you even think, of putting
yourself in that situation ?

38:04.628 --> 38:06.080
To risk your health, your life ?

38:06.112 --> 38:07.229
Rene was sick.

38:07.632 --> 38:08.533
I was alone.

38:08.592 --> 38:10.491
And I didn't need
to be consulted ?

38:11.061 --> 38:12.363
Even told there was a baby.

38:12.389 --> 38:14.123
But I wasn't thinking about you.

38:14.530 --> 38:17.327
I had no idea, where
I would end up.

38:17.585 --> 38:18.537
Please don't..

38:18.772 --> 38:21.311
For God's sake, this
is our child !!

38:22.382 --> 38:24.006
And it always will be.

38:27.968 --> 38:30.311
George Bligh and
his bastard Jew.

38:30.624 --> 38:31.663
Be realistic.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.284
- Don't say that.
- Why not ?

38:33.964 --> 38:35.256
Everyone else will.

38:38.261 --> 38:39.073
You see ?

38:41.483 --> 38:42.639
You know it too.

38:45.253 --> 38:46.477
There's no future.

38:49.464 --> 38:50.688
How can there be ?

39:12.267 --> 39:13.267
Hello there.

39:14.630 --> 39:16.056
Mrs Collins,

39:17.544 --> 39:18.685
Mrs Bligh.

39:18.779 --> 39:21.024
My dear, you must
call me Regina.

39:21.408 --> 39:23.079
I was passing by and I thought,

39:23.115 --> 39:25.818
how nice would it be, to have
a cup of tea, with one of our

39:25.920 --> 39:28.552
most valuable
campaign volunteers.

39:28.990 --> 39:30.555
I need your assistance.

39:31.599 --> 39:34.072
Well, I pop the kettle on.

40:24.064 --> 40:25.072
Oooh!

41:12.775 --> 41:14.697
I will always remember you.
Lloyd.

41:42.392 --> 41:43.313
Thank you.

41:49.148 --> 41:51.597
We're going on an
adventure, are we ?

42:08.450 --> 42:09.418
Lizzie !

42:24.356 --> 42:25.377
Are you there ?

42:34.176 --> 42:35.082
Huh !

42:49.111 --> 42:50.482
You fancy a cuppa ?

42:51.236 --> 42:53.755
I must get on to Ash Park.

42:53.763 --> 42:57.542
Apparently, I've become
integral to the campaign.

42:57.568 --> 42:59.888
The new Mrs Bligh
came to see me.

42:59.915 --> 43:01.771
She even helped me with this.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.880
Well, she's a lot of things,
but she's not silly.

43:03.896 --> 43:06.189
She knows a good helper,
when she sees one.

43:09.724 --> 43:11.716
- This is for you.
- My tonic.

43:11.752 --> 43:13.572
- Thank you, Doris.
- My pleasure.

43:13.994 --> 43:15.559
You got a bit of ehm...

43:17.732 --> 43:19.193
Goodness me !

43:19.408 --> 43:21.236
It's the man himself !

43:26.057 --> 43:27.064
Mr Bligh.

43:30.307 --> 43:31.744
Well, if you'll excuse us.

43:31.791 --> 43:33.868
Mrs Collins and I, have
got some very important

43:33.894 --> 43:35.556
election business
to take care of.

43:35.572 --> 43:36.849
Come on, I'm driving.

43:52.322 --> 43:53.837
Who cares what people think ?

43:54.135 --> 43:55.087
What they say.

43:56.951 --> 43:58.341
I just wanna be with you.

44:00.877 --> 44:03.798
Whatever was between us,
George, you are a married...

44:03.861 --> 44:04.845
Nothing else matters.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.236
... and equally unavailable.

44:07.377 --> 44:10.642
We will be together, Sarah.
I promise you.

44:15.334 --> 44:17.511
I was harsh before, I apologise.

44:17.935 --> 44:19.160
Whatever it takes.

44:22.869 --> 44:24.365
However long you need.

44:28.951 --> 44:31.841
You will always be a part
of this child's life.

44:39.580 --> 44:41.076
However long you need.

44:43.013 --> 44:43.857
I love you.

45:07.650 --> 45:08.807
Where is my son ?

45:09.849 --> 45:10.880
I don't know.

45:13.873 --> 45:16.186
I will have to go to the
publisher between 3 and 4.

45:17.177 --> 45:19.263
This doesn't look
professional enough.

45:19.334 --> 45:21.747
Imagine, the publisher
wanted to see me.

45:21.756 --> 45:24.400
And he mentioned a book
launch and book signing.
