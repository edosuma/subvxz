Rob told me that you had a visit
from the misper team.

He's worried that
they might have found Sarah.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.160
They haven't, have they?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.800
No.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.840
But they're winding down
the inquiry.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.080
Which means they think
she's dead.

have to say for herself?

to call the police.

rough with me.

he was planning to blackmail

13:42.040 --> 13:44.800
into giving him £5,000

Philip asked me
to go back to the house,

just to talk about things
he might need for the baby.

I was waking up in a cellar.

He's a big lad.

when he broke in?

he would get help.

I came home,

at me,

I had to meet the robber,
