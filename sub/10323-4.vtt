[ Chattering ]

00:04.105 --> 00:07.075
[ Earl Narrating ]
I guess my favorite time
in prison is nighttime.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.143
[ Man On P.A. ]
Lights out.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.011
[ Earl Narrating ]
When it's dark and peaceful,

00:11.079 --> 00:15.449
you can almost feel like
you're not stuck
behind bars anymore.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.486
[ Man On P.A. ]
Outside lights on.
[ Men Groan ]

00:18.552 --> 00:21.489
[ Earl Narrating ]
Those are the best
seven seconds of my day.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.426
Prisoners like to complain,
of course,

00:25.493 --> 00:29.330
but we're not the only ones
who can feel trapped.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.466
Sometimes Darnell felt trapped
in a job that conflicted...

00:32.533 --> 00:34.968
with his kind
and gentle nature.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.471
[ Crab Screeching ]

00:39.507 --> 00:42.843
Catalina sometimes felt trapped
just by bein' too pretty.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.846
Is the Latina girl gonna
be walking to her car soon?

00:45.913 --> 00:50.050
'Cause they're really strict
about curfew at
the halfway house.

00:52.019 --> 00:55.323
[ Earl Narrating ]
Randy sometimes felt trapped
in his day-to-day life.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.559
Randy!
I wanted the baby one
on the bottom.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.528
[ Earl Narrating ]
And sometimes Joy
felt trapped...

01:00.594 --> 01:02.530
just taking care
of her overactive kids.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.532
[ Object Smashing ]
You two settle down!

01:04.598 --> 01:06.934
And get Mama's thong
off your head.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.837
You had pinkeye last week.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.274
[ Earl Narrating ]
But I, for one,
was about to get an escape.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.809
"Prison Creative Writing."

01:15.876 --> 01:19.880
Creative writing
is a wonderful way
to escape from prison...

01:19.947 --> 01:22.450
in your imagination.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.153
It's a chance
to free your mind,

01:25.219 --> 01:27.521
even if you're stuck
behind walls...

01:27.588 --> 01:31.459
and a five-point limb
and torso restraint.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.928
Anyway, I want you men
to create a story...

01:34.995 --> 01:36.997
where you're
the main character.

01:37.064 --> 01:40.468
And you can do
absolutely anything!

01:40.534 --> 01:43.771
[ Narrating ] This tiny armored
lady was actually getting me
excited about writing,

01:43.837 --> 01:46.540
saying how the pen is mightier
than the sword.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.311
[ Body Thuds ]
Then someone used their pen
as a sword.

01:50.378 --> 01:55.149
Excuse me, Mrs. Teacher.
I think Enrico might need
a pass to the nurse's office.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.186

01:58.252 --> 02:00.721
My name is Earl.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.826
[ Earl Narrating ]
Gettin' started on
my creative writin' project...

02:05.893 --> 02:07.695
was harder than I expected.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.697
I always thought
I had a good imagination,

02:09.763 --> 02:12.633
but it turns out
that was just my imagination.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.835
Hey, Earl, how do
you spell "hematoma"?

02:14.902 --> 02:19.673
I don't know, Sonny.
If you're gonna make up words,
just make up how to spell 'em.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.244
No, it's a real word. See,
I'm writing a story about
me beatin' up a gymnast.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.713
I hate those guys.

02:25.779 --> 02:30.351
I wish I had an idea. I'm tryin'
to write, but just
drawin' a blank.

02:30.418 --> 02:34.188
You're being too uptight, man.
You gotta just close your eyes
and look inside your brain.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.457
You know, like when
you're driving on meth.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.226
[ Earl Narrating ]
I'd never driven
on meth before,

02:38.292 --> 02:41.362
but I've ridden shotgun
plenty of times
while someone else did,

02:41.429 --> 02:43.697
and closin' your eyes did help.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.166
So I gave it a shot.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.915
So, this is my imagination.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.184
Cool.

03:04.252 --> 03:07.988
Okay, my story can be
about me doin' anything.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.458
Anything I can imagine.

03:15.763 --> 03:19.166
You could put me
in your story.
Worked for Sonny.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.403
Come on, hit me.
Break my nose.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.038
That-That's Sonny's thing.
Sweet of you, though.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.441
You can go now.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.815
Well, I can't leave unless
you stop thinkin' about me.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.718
Right.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.687
[ Gasps ]

03:41.989 --> 03:43.824
You're thinking about me.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.860
Shut up!

03:46.927 --> 03:51.231
And that right there
took me a little less than
four and one-half hours.

03:51.299 --> 03:55.836
Writin' sounds cool.
You could make a world
where anything could happen,

03:55.903 --> 03:59.707
like a guy all alone
in a boat, huntin'
a big, white whale.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.377
Randy, nobody's gonna
want to read that.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.913
That's okay.
I got lots of ideas.

[ Earl Narrating ]
Randy's been lost a lot,
but never lost in thought.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.218
Suddenly, he was in
a world of his own.

He got so nasty and sweaty

Then mice came,
and the nasty slob said--
Shoo, mice.

But the mice couldn't shoo
because they were too stuck
to the damn slob.

at the slob's filthy house
stuck to the slob.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.187

And then as sure
as poo on your shoe,
everything stuck to the slob.

11:01.394 --> 11:04.698
Mountains stuck to him,

11:04.765 --> 11:07.701
And the slob-clump
got so heavy that he fell
clear off the Earth.

And he fell all the way
through space until he landed
on God's desk,
