And--oh, Judee Sill,
I know you're mad at me,

25:41.249 --> 25:43.084
but I need you on guitar.

25:43.251 --> 25:44.836
And I need a volunteer
for shakers.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.454
[Bambi] Hey, Doug.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.830
Um, I took some initiative

26:20.997 --> 26:22.373
and finished
the Minx calendars for you.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.208
Oh, that's unexpected, Bambs.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.961
It's pretty complicated work

-Thank you.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.180
You kept the pictures big,

26:37.346 --> 26:40.016
and you even got Joyce's
boring quotes in there, Bambs.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.143
Yeah, well,
the image is the real draw,

26:42.268 --> 26:44.020
so I put the quotes
in complimentary colors

26:44.187 --> 26:45.521
