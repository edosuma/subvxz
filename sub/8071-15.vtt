[theme music]

00:09.110 --> 00:11.345
Darlene, get out there
and clear the table.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.713
In a minute.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.715
No, I'm tired of
having this argument

00:14.815 --> 00:17.351
with you every single morning
and I want you do it now.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.587
I'm watching dad shovel snow.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.488
Oh, scoot over.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.558
If you listen real
close you can hear

00:24.658 --> 00:27.961
him wheezing a little tune.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.964
I don't know why he won't get
somebody to do that for him.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.201
One of these days he's just
going to keel over out there

00:33.301 --> 00:37.438
and then I won't be able to
get my car out of the driveway.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.740
Here's my new birthday list.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.876
Oh, well let's see.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.178
A new bathrobe--

00:44.278 --> 00:47.315
Yeah, I'm gonna take a
bath every night from now on.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.949
Oh yeah?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.584
And a new desk lamp?

00:50.684 --> 00:53.154
I bet you that's so you can
do your homework better, huh?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.455
Uh huh.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.525
And let's see what else
we got down here, uh--

00:57.625 --> 00:58.426
oh!

00:58.526 --> 01:00.961
A Super Nintendo video game.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.464
Yeah, if that's too
many things, cross-off

01:03.564 --> 01:04.465
the lamp and the robe.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.937
I told you DJ, we can't
afford a video game now.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.939
But all my friends
have them and they

01:12.039 --> 01:14.275
make fun of me because I don't.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.145
That's not why they
make fun of you DJ.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.114
It's not fair.

01:20.214 --> 01:23.551
Dad, will you get
me a Super Nintendo?

01:23.651 --> 01:25.486
No.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.687
But if I don't catch
my breath maybe

01:26.787 --> 01:29.089
your new daddy will buy you one.

01:29.190 --> 01:29.990
I hate it here.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.092
I wish I lived somewhere else.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.128
Well now, honey,
you just remember

01:34.228 --> 01:37.331
that wish when you're blowing
out your birthday candles.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.200
I'm going to Todd's--
he has Genesis.

01:43.671 --> 01:44.505
So did you get it for him?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.474
Yeah, it's at the shop.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.809
I even got ol' Deej an
educational game to go with it.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.044
Yeah, did you get the
Super Mario Brothers too?

01:51.145 --> 01:52.280
I didn't forget you dear.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.415
Yes!

01:54.515 --> 01:55.583
Wait a minute.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.117
You guys actually got
him the video game?

01:57.218 --> 01:58.419
That's like 200 bucks.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.053
Well, I got a little
extra repair work going,

02:00.154 --> 02:01.222
so I've got a little extra cash.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.390
What's your problem Darlene?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.691
Well how come when
it was my birthday

02:03.791 --> 02:05.226
and I hinted around
for a leather jacket,

02:05.326 --> 02:06.460
I didn't get one?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.761
Well, we wanted
to surprise you.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.467
Funny.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.402
Are you leaving?

02:14.502 --> 02:15.569
Yeah, I'm going
to the bookstore--

02:15.669 --> 02:17.371
- Bookstore.
- Bye.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.572
Well, I'm out of here too.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.840
You working in the
restaurant today?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.842
No, I actually
got the day off.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.244
Oh, goodie for you.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.345
What are you gonna do?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.779
Well, what do you think
I'm going to do Dan?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.781
Sit here on my butt and
paint my toenails all day?

02:27.881 --> 02:29.483
I'm going to clean the house.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.453
So get out of here,
Dan, you big idiot.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.687
It's not like
you went and bought

02:33.787 --> 02:38.792
me one of those self-cleaning
electric Jetson houses.

02:38.892 --> 02:44.265
[door slams]

02:44.365 --> 03:06.153
[sigh]

03:06.254 --> 03:08.589
Ooh!

03:08.689 --> 03:09.757
Oh god!

03:09.857 --> 03:11.659
Oh my back!

03:11.759 --> 03:12.560
Ooh.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.795
I can't move!

03:14.895 --> 03:17.698
Dan!

03:17.798 --> 03:21.602
[groaning]

03:21.702 --> 03:22.936
Oh!

03:23.036 --> 03:25.873
I-- I can't get up and I don't
have one of those things!

03:29.477 --> 03:34.348
I shouldn't have laughed
at that old lady on TV.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.351
Dan!

[theme music]

04:27.335 --> 04:28.802
[video game music from tv]

04:28.902 --> 04:30.003
What do I do?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.605
It's kind of like that
Sega game, "Hedgehog"--

04:31.705 --> 04:34.675
you gotta power
up or you're dead.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.909
What happened?

04:36.009 --> 04:37.745
You're dead.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.513
That skeleton stabbed
you through the heart.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.481
That's your blood.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.717
Oh man, DJ's gonna love this!

04:43.817 --> 04:45.419
Once he gets it we'll
never see him again.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.854
Let's give it to him now.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.822
One more time.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.793
[video game music from tv]

04:52.893 --> 04:57.164
I'm glad DJ's getting
something he really wants.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.299
Well, I'm off to my
boring job so some day I

04:59.400 --> 05:01.034
can afford to buy myself a car.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.070
Hey, hey, hey.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.372
Hold it right there.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.606
What?

05:05.706 --> 05:06.840
Every time your
mom and me scrape

05:06.940 --> 05:08.075
together a little
extra cash, you

05:08.175 --> 05:09.877
start hitting us up for a car.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.712
Well that is the
best time, isn't it?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.246
Well we're sick of it Becky.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.348
Jeez, you know
I'm down there--

05:14.448 --> 05:16.817
Let me finish.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.920
So we decided you
should have one.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.422
You're going to buy me a car?

05:21.522 --> 05:24.024
That would be great, wouldn't
it, but it's just not us, no.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.963
What we will do is match
you dollar for dollar.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.965
Whatever you put down,
we'll put down the same.

05:32.065 --> 05:32.866
Really?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.768
Same for insurance, 50/50.

05:34.868 --> 05:35.803
That's a deal!

05:35.903 --> 05:37.738
So, how much you got saved up?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.840
- About $400.
- Already?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.442
Congratulations,
today's the day!

05:41.542 --> 05:44.512
Nope, you're not
getting off that easy.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.746
Thanks daddy.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.814
[phone ringing]

05:46.914 --> 05:48.348
Yeah, well you've
been working real hard

05:48.449 --> 05:50.584
so we figure you deserve the
very best car that no more

05:50.684 --> 05:51.785
than $2,200 can buy.

hey Deej, what's going on?

05:55.923 --> 05:58.826
Oh no.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.060
Well is she OK--
let me talk to her.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.228
What's going on?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.329
Your mom threw her back out.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.230
How bad?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.331
I don't know yet.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.266
God, I hope it's not
like that last time.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.869
It hurt her just to
take a deep breath.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.571
Hey honey, are you OK?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.672
Ow Dan, it hurts, it hurts.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.540
Ow--

06:15.643 --> 06:17.511
She's breathing OK.

06:17.611 --> 06:21.248
[music playing]

06:21.348 --> 06:24.418
OK, I got you, easy,
just a few more steps.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.855
Oh, don't let go
cause I'll tip over.

06:27.955 --> 06:28.922
So what happened?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.257
You hurt yourself while
you were cleaning?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.793
No, I didn't
even get that far.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.596
You didn't try to
shovel the walk, did you?

06:35.696 --> 06:36.497
You got me.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.334
So what, it's your
upper back again?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.003
No, it's my whole back.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.840
It kinda just like, totally
spasmed out, you know.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.377
I was screaming so loud DJ
could hear me from next door.

06:50.478 --> 06:54.882
After about an hour he came
home to see what was wrong.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.450
We should call a doctor.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.887
No, he's just going to tell me
to stay in bed and take it easy

06:59.987 --> 07:02.089
and not do anything.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.658
OK, call him.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.127
Well, sorry mom but
unless you're going to die

07:07.227 --> 07:08.929
or something, I'm late for work.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.731
I'll survive.

07:10.831 --> 07:11.732
See ya.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.167
Yeah.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.169
She kissed me.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.706
She must know
about our car deal.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.542
Uh huh.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.810
Did she kiss you?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.979
No, but she hugged
me and called me daddy.

07:26.079 --> 07:30.250
All our kids have a
price, don't they Dan.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.520
Here's the heating pad.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.755
Oh DJ, I'm so
sorry but I'm not

07:34.855 --> 07:36.590
going to be able to make
you a birthday party

07:36.690 --> 07:38.626
until I'm feeling better.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.895
Well can't grandma do it?

07:41.995 --> 07:44.565
Grandma?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.500
You can go now DJ.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.335
Your mother is coming?

07:48.435 --> 07:51.471
Yeah, I sort of called her.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.040
And what did you tell her?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.543
That I was in
excruciating pain.

07:55.643 --> 07:59.880
Oh jeez Roseanne, couldn't
you think of me first?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.281
Dan, you're
going to be at work

08:01.381 --> 08:02.950
and the kids are
going to be at school.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.185
I need somebody here
to take care of me.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.687
I can't even get out of bed.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.188
All right, all right.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.823
Once you're back on your
feet, she's out of here.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.659
- OK.
- I'll get you some tea.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.560
Thank you.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.697
DAN: Oh my god, Wayne Newton!

08:16.797 --> 08:18.165
Rosie, come out here, quick!

08:18.265 --> 08:20.367
Wayne's here.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.770
Nice try.

08:22.870 --> 08:23.737
DAN: Damn.

08:23.837 --> 08:29.376
[music playing]

08:29.476 --> 08:31.478
How are those
apple pancakes dear?

08:31.579 --> 08:32.379
Oh, they're perfect.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.650
Remember how I
always made them

08:36.750 --> 08:38.886
for you when you were sick.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.453
Oh you were so great.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.556
You would feed a
fever and a cold.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.329
You were such a
horrible patient.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.632
I had to hide your
medicine in your food.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.938
What kind of medicine?

08:58.038 --> 09:02.109
Oh, whatever I had that
would make you drowsy.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.510
Hey.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.445
Hi, did you get all
the stuff I wanted?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.280
Yes, my queen.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.116
Here are your
magazines, and there

09:09.216 --> 09:12.586
is the hand lotion, under-eye
moisturizer, cuticle cream,

09:12.686 --> 09:14.154
and three Emery boards.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.388
Well, where's my gum?

09:15.488 --> 09:17.390
Oh, here.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.558
Oh.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.361
No, I didn't want spearmint,
I want peppermint.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.462
So?

09:22.562 --> 09:27.400
Oh, spearmint doesn't
make me feel better.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.103
Just chew it.

09:30.203 --> 09:35.108
I haven't even had a chance
to say hi to my own mom yet.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.878
Hi mom.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.379
Hello Jackie.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.148
Well, how are you doing?

09:41.248 --> 09:46.186
Well, even in the middle of
an ugly divorce, life goes on.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.422
Fortunately, I still have one
daughter who asks me to visit.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.394
How can you even say that?

09:54.494 --> 09:56.997
She's treating you
like a slave here.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.901
Which is more than I
could expect from you dear.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.771
[blows tongue]

10:03.871 --> 10:04.738
Morning.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.240
Oh, happy birthday DJ.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.076
Can you get out of bed yet?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.911
No honey, I'm sorry, I can't.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.612
What about my cake?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.782
I'll make you one, DJ.

10:14.882 --> 10:19.586
I want from the
store, like mom makes.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.389
Well, you're just
gonna have to suffer.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.591
This stinks.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.526
Where's my birthday kiss?

10:26.626 --> 10:29.029
Come and get it.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.599
And he's my favorite.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.702
He's at that age
where the whole world

10:34.802 --> 10:36.770
revolves around him.

10:36.870 --> 10:41.474
Yes, my little
boy's becoming a man.

10:41.574 --> 10:45.813
[music playing]

10:45.913 --> 10:46.714
Hey.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.681
DJ home?

10:47.781 --> 10:48.581
No.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.950
Aw, you know where he is?

10:50.050 --> 10:52.820
Uh, no, but I think my mom
picked him up from school.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.221
Mmm.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.455
I went to the school
to surprise him.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.324
I was going to take
him out for ice cream.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.625
Oh, well I guess
you had to eat

10:58.726 --> 11:00.928
the ice cream all by yourself
then, didn't you, honey?

11:01.028 --> 11:03.864
Well, I was just trying to
make his day a little special--

11:03.964 --> 11:04.798
it's his 10th birthday.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.633
Dan, have you
got any more tape?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.802
I'll go get it.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.570
You know, you been throwing
your back out like this

11:10.670 --> 11:12.039
since you were like, 15.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.306
No kidding.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.875
Don't you think you ought
to do something about it?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.710
Well, what would
you suggest Jackie?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.879
Well, back when
I was a cop and got

11:18.979 --> 11:20.347
injured in the line of duty--

11:20.447 --> 11:22.916
Oh please!

11:23.016 --> 11:26.353
You fell down a
flight of stairs.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.955
Stop making it
sound like you threw

11:28.055 --> 11:31.558
your body on a live grenade.

11:31.658 --> 11:35.763
I hurt my back, is the point.

11:35.863 --> 11:41.034
And I have always found
exercise to be the answer.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.069
Really?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.170
Well that's great.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.504
Well why don't you jog
out into the kitchen

11:44.604 --> 11:47.507
and make me some hot chocolate?

11:47.607 --> 11:49.009
They just pulled up.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.978
Oh, well where do you
want the video game then?

11:51.078 --> 11:51.879
Up on top?

11:51.979 --> 11:52.780
No, no no--

11:52.880 --> 11:53.713
put it under the bed.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.082
Yeah, see.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.617
We're going to make him open
all the other presidents first

11:57.717 --> 12:00.587
and then when he starts whining
and being real bratty about how

12:00.687 --> 12:03.223
he didn't get the video game,
then we'll give it to him

12:03.323 --> 12:06.794
and then he'll
feel really stupid.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.897
Most parents would
just give him the gift.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.364
Mom, I'm home.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.465
Guess what grandma got me.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.366
What?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.367
Super Nintendo!

12:17.470 --> 12:19.039
I know it's a
little extravagant

12:19.139 --> 12:20.841
but he seemed to
want it so much,

12:20.941 --> 12:22.509
we stopped off on the way home.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.812
Dad, help me hook it up.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.080
Sure.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.549
Well DJ, don't you want to
open all your other presents?

12:29.649 --> 12:32.953
Negative.

12:33.053 --> 12:36.589
I guess I'll just get
started on the birthday cake.

12:36.689 --> 12:40.127
Well make sure you put some
extra medicine in Dan's piece.

12:40.227 --> 12:50.537
[music playing]

12:50.637 --> 12:52.272
This is really great, gran.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.141
Well thank you Becky,
I wanted everything

12:54.241 --> 12:56.076
to be special for DJ.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.310
Can I go now?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.579
No you are not playing
your video game until you've

12:59.679 --> 13:00.713
had your birthday cake.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.482
Oh, all right.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.317
ROSEANNE: How's
it going in there?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.686
Fine, dear.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.588
ROSEANNE: Dan still mad?

13:08.688 --> 13:11.091
No Rosie, everything's good.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.493
ROSEANNE: Is he lying, Jackie?

13:13.593 --> 13:16.029
No Roseanne, he's fine.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.398
ROSEANNE: OK.

13:18.498 --> 13:22.469
Dan, I'm really sorry that
I didn't check with you first.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.703
Don't worry about it, Bev.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.572
I can take the game back
and get him something else,

13:25.672 --> 13:27.074
it's no big deal.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.475
You know dad,
you shouldn't keep

13:28.575 --> 13:30.043
that anger all
bottled up like that--

13:30.143 --> 13:33.013
you'll just get diarrhea.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.548
I said I'm fine, Darlene.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.617
How's the job Becky?

13:37.717 --> 13:39.419
Why?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.454
I'm changing
the subject Becky.

13:41.554 --> 13:45.458
Oh, um, well they moved
me up to the express line.

13:45.558 --> 13:46.659
Really?

13:46.759 --> 13:49.429
Well they must have a
lot of confidence in you.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.533
Yeah right, all I have
to do is count to 10.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.037
Don't wear mittens,
it'll slow you down.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.972
ROSEANNE: [laugh]

13:59.072 --> 14:00.908
Mother!

14:01.008 --> 14:03.410
ROSEANNE: Well, it
was funny Becky.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.778
Well I'm glad
you're all laughing.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.048
I'm the one who's got to
go back there tonight.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.950
You're working pretty
hard these days, aren't you

14:10.050 --> 14:10.951
sweetheart.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.386
Yeah, well I'm
saving up to buy a car.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.888
Dad's matching me
dollar for dollar

14:14.988 --> 14:16.756
so I'm really trying
to break the bank.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.291
But what about
your schoolwork?

14:18.391 --> 14:19.492
Oh, I'm doing it.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.495
And your social life, you
can't be having any fun.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.797
Well I guess I don't
really see Mark that much.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.867
Nice going Bev, you
gave away the plan.

14:27.968 --> 14:31.571
I don't know, it just
seems like such a shame.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.040
Can we do the cake now?

14:33.140 --> 14:34.807
Of course sweetheart.

14:34.908 --> 14:43.816
ALL: Happy Birthday to you,
happy birthday to you--

14:43.917 --> 14:44.717
ROSEANNE: What happened?

14:44.817 --> 14:47.554
Did you forget the words?

14:47.654 --> 14:48.922
He took off.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.423
ROSEANNE: Oh.

14:50.523 --> 14:54.394
Well, I'll have his piece.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.331
You know Becky, all these
years I've been driving

14:58.431 --> 15:00.400
your grandfather's
hand me downs, it's

15:00.500 --> 15:03.470
time I had a new car of my own.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.239
But the one I have is
in very good condition.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.740
Weren't you
making coffee, mom?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.076
In a minute dear.

15:09.176 --> 15:13.880
Becky, you don't have a car and
soon I'll have one too many.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.148
Bev.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.985
Oh Dan, she's got
years ahead of her

15:18.085 --> 15:19.152
where she'll have to work.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.088
Let her enjoy herself
while she's young.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.924
Mom, don't you think you ought
to use that car for a trade in?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.893
It's your father's money dear.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.795
It's my pleasure to spend it.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.833
- No.
- Why not?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.302
We have an arrangement.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.404
Dad, I can get
a car for nothing.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.506
You'll get a car
by working for it.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.808
Dad, If I have a car, it'll
be easier for me to get to work.

15:41.908 --> 15:42.809
Bull.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.277
The minute you get
a car, you'll find

15:44.377 --> 15:46.946
some reason to stop working.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.649
I can't believe you think
that, that's so unfair.

15:49.749 --> 15:50.617
We had a deal.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.019
Well I like
grandma's deal better.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.620
Becky it's better
to earn something

15:53.720 --> 15:55.022
than to have it
just handed to you.

15:55.122 --> 15:55.822
Well I wouldn't
know, I've never had

15:55.922 --> 15:56.856
anything haded to me before.

15:56.956 --> 16:01.194
Oh right, like your
life just stinks!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.696
It would make me
happy to do this Dan.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.165
Well Bev, that's
why I had these kids--

16:05.265 --> 16:07.234
just to make you happy.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.636
Aren't you being a
little unreasonable?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.738
I don't think so.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.873
Well at least go
up and talk to her.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.008
Well why don't you do it.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.543
You're doing such a
great job deciding

16:16.643 --> 16:17.844
what's right and
wrong for my kids,

16:17.944 --> 16:19.046
they obviously don't need me.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.652
[door slams]

16:25.752 --> 16:29.256
ROSEANNE: Hey, I
could use a new car.

16:29.356 --> 16:35.828
[music playing]

16:35.928 --> 16:36.729
Dan--

16:36.829 --> 16:38.698
Yep?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.700
You know you didn't have to
come down tonight Mr. Conner--

16:40.800 --> 16:42.001
I had some paperwork.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.175
You gonna let
Becky have the car?

16:48.275 --> 16:49.942
You know about that already?

16:50.043 --> 16:52.412
Well she called me right
after you left the house.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.980
And what advice did
you have for her Mark?

16:54.081 --> 16:57.517
I asked her why she
wanted an old lady car.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.353
Interesting approach.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.223
Yeah, they worked it
all out without you.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.058
And what exactly
did they work out?

17:05.158 --> 17:06.526
Well your wife
gets grandma's car

17:06.626 --> 17:09.129
and Becky gets your
wife's old car.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.497
If Becky keeps
working then you're

17:10.597 --> 17:14.901
still going to pay half when
she goes to get a better car.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.104
They leave me any cake?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.171
[shop door bells ringing]

17:18.271 --> 17:19.072
BEVERLY: Dan?

17:23.610 --> 17:24.477
In here.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.949
Oh hello.

17:30.049 --> 17:30.983
Bev, this is Mark.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.353
Mark, this is
Becky's grandmother.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.254
Hey.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.189
Is this the boyfriend?

17:36.289 --> 17:37.757
It is.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.393
Well, I understand
what Becky sees in you.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.929
You look like that Fonzie fellow
who's so popular these days.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.170
Thanks, uh, well,
nice meeting you.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.638
Will see you
tomorrow Mr. Conner.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.539
Ayyyyy!

17:58.010 --> 18:01.981
Well you came down here to
get away from me and here I am.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.752
I had some work to do.

18:05.852 --> 18:10.190
You know, as I was
buying DJ that gift I just

18:10.290 --> 18:12.425
knew I was doing
the wrong thing,

18:12.525 --> 18:16.163
but while we were in
the car he asked me

18:16.263 --> 18:18.531
if grandpa married
this other lady,

18:18.631 --> 18:21.534
would she be his grandma too?

18:21.634 --> 18:22.469
Ouch.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.204
Yeah.

18:24.304 --> 18:28.975
So I started to think that
without Grandpa Al, maybe

18:29.075 --> 18:31.644
I wouldn't be as welcome.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.447
He's always been
fun for the kids.

18:34.547 --> 18:39.586
All I ever seem to say is, get
your finger out of your nose.

18:39.686 --> 18:43.890
So I was just going for a
little extra popularity.

18:43.990 --> 18:48.761
Well, you know what,
I guess I was too.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.930
I mean it isn't often that I
could afford to get something

18:51.030 --> 18:53.099
nice for my kids and
I had two shots today

18:53.200 --> 18:54.734
and somehow you aced
me out of both of them.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.673
I'm sorry.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.509
I'm sorry I yelled.

19:02.609 --> 19:07.480
That's OK, it made me feel
like part of the family.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.981
Well if it makes
you feel any better,

19:09.081 --> 19:11.017
the kids don't like grandpa
anymore than they like you.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.390
Thank you.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.559
And I've got an idea.

19:19.659 --> 19:23.796
Until Roseanne's back is better,
I'll just take care of my kid

19:23.896 --> 19:27.500
and you can take care of yours.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.401
Deal.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.874
Dan I'm not sure
you ever knew this,

19:34.974 --> 19:39.779
but I wasn't too thrilled
when Roseanne married you.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.880
You wore black to the wedding.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.653
But I have to say,
you've turned out to be

19:46.753 --> 19:48.621
a wonderful husband and father.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.790
And?

19:50.890 --> 19:51.858
And what?

19:51.958 --> 19:54.227
Well what do I get?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.428
What do you mean?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.730
Well come on, you
gave Roseanne a car.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.131
Oh, Dan.

19:59.232 --> 20:05.638
No, all I need is a, a TV, big
screen, and a satellite dish.

20:05.738 --> 20:13.813
[music playing]

20:13.913 --> 20:17.550
[video game music from tv]

20:17.650 --> 20:19.552
Dan: I will fix the car Becky.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.054
You always fix it and
it always breaks down.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.856
It's a little temperamental
in cold weather.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.758
Mom what's the point
of me having a car if it

20:25.858 --> 20:27.226
won't even get me to work?

20:27.327 --> 20:30.430
Well, it'll get you close.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.232
I oughta just take it down
to the junkyard and sell it.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.202
Oh it'll never
get you that far.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.704
This stinks.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.806
You'll get a new car
when you earn a new car,

20:39.906 --> 20:42.141
until then this is
better than the bus.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.278
Well, the bus
gets better mileage.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.579
You're not helping.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.015
Gee, Becky, you been
griping to drive that car ever

20:49.115 --> 20:51.318
since you got your damn license.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.218
Now it's yours.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.386
Yeah, well it's not fair.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.755
You get grandma's car
and I get your old bomb.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.823
Well, what can I say?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.458
My mommy's better
than your mommy.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.964
Great.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.299
How you doing?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.735
Two more swords and I'm
queen of the monkey people.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.344
I meant you're back.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.813
Oh, well I can't
do the laundry

21:20.913 --> 21:24.083
and I'm not making
dinner so why do you ask?

21:24.183 --> 21:26.719
Because you have a doctor's
appointment, we got to go.

21:26.819 --> 21:27.820
I don't want to.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.256
He's not going to hurt you.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.458
Yes he will.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.793
He'll tell me I'm fine
then he'll tell me I should

21:33.893 --> 21:35.962
do the laundry and make dinner.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.230
We'll just have
to risk it dear.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.066
Why are you making me do this?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.368
Because I love you.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.570
No you don't love me, you
just want me to get better.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.471
Keep moving.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.775
I want my mommy.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.014
