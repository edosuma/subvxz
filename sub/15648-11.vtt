HUH?

14:00.339 --> 14:04.134
[screaming]

14:12.685 --> 14:14.812
"WELCOME TO HECK:

14:14.895 --> 14:17.439
A FRIENDLY COMMUNITY"

14:21.277 --> 14:22.444
- I AM THE DARK UNDERLORD.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.406
THE PRINCE OF DOOM.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.741
THE KING OF ETERNAL TORMENT.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.618
I AM FEAR!
I AM EVIL!

14:29.702 --> 14:34.206
THEY CALL ME... PEACHES.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.124
- PEACHES?

14:35.207 --> 14:38.127
- WOULD YOU
LET ME FINISH?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.880
YOU WILL ROT IN TORMENT FOREVER.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.966
[evil laughter]

14:44.049 --> 14:44.925
PEACHES?

14:45.009 --> 14:46.844
- OKAY, HEFFER.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.554
OH, THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.348
I... WHAT WAS I SAYING?

14:51.432 --> 14:52.725
JUST FORGET IT.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.476
- WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.395
AH, IT'S JUST
FOR THE TOURISTS.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.105
BE SEATED.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.065
- WOW! COOL!

15:00.149 --> 15:00.482
- YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.985
- WOW!

15:03.068 --> 15:06.488

TUBE-O-VISION 3000.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.698
AND IT BELONGS TO ME!

15:07.781 --> 15:10.909
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES IT?

15:10.993 --> 15:13.829
- HMM... I GIVE UP.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.331
- IT'S THE TV FROM HECK.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.209
[both laughing]

15:19.918 --> 15:22.838
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.715
HECK?

15:24.798 --> 15:26.508
ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE...

15:26.592 --> 15:28.344
- CENSORS.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.304
THERE'S THE LAMP FROM HECK

15:30.387 --> 15:31.847
AND HERE'S THE PINEAPPLE
FROM HECK.

15:31.930 --> 15:36.310
- I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.353
- OKAY, NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

15:37.436 --> 15:40.147
OH, YEAH.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.358
YOU ARE GUILTY OF ONE
OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS!

15:42.441 --> 15:44.652
GLUTTONY!

15:44.735 --> 15:45.944

15:46.028 --> 15:47.655
HEY, PEACHES, YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO EAT AROUND HERE?

15:47.738 --> 15:50.491
- YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

15:50.574 --> 15:52.534
SEVEN DEADLY SINS?

15:52.618 --> 15:53.535
GLUTTONY?

15:53.619 --> 15:54.703
GLUTTON!

15:54.787 --> 15:58.457
YOU... ARE... A... GLUTTON!

15:58.540 --> 15:59.708
- GLUE-TON?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.877
- NOW, TURN TO CHANNEL THREE.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.923
- SURE! WHERE'S THE REMOTE?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.467
- YOU POOR FOOL.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.386
STILL DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE, DO YOU?

16:10.469 --> 16:12.096
THERE IS NO REMOTE!

16:12.179 --> 16:14.431
- [screams]

16:14.515 --> 16:16.517
- YOU THINK THAT'S SCARY?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.852
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

16:18.936 --> 16:20.979

16:38.080 --> 16:38.997
YOU'VE GOT A CHICKEN BONE
CAUGHT IN YOUR THROAT.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.916
HEFF, YOU'VE GOT X's FOR EYES.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.211
WHAT IN THE BLAZES
DOES THAT MEAN?

16:44.294 --> 16:46.422
[all coughing]

16:46.505 --> 16:50.300
- YOUR GLUTTONY WENT FAR BEYOND
A MERE MANIA FOR FOOD.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.510
IT HURT OTHERS.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.345
PEOPLE WHO LOVED YOU.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.513
OBSERVE.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.808
- MY CAKE! MY CAKE!

16:57.891 --> 17:02.688
OH, DID YOU EVEN
TASTE IT, YOU WALRUS?

17:02.771 --> 17:05.107
[crying]

17:05.190 --> 17:08.277

17:22.624 --> 17:25.544
I'M A GLUE-TON!

17:25.627 --> 17:28.464
I'M A GLUE-TON!

17:28.547 --> 17:29.715
I'M GLAD I'M DEAD.

17:29.798 --> 17:33.761
- ALMOST GOT IT, HEFF.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.518
[screaming]

17:45.063 --> 17:47.483
- WELL, IT LOOKS AS IF EVEN
YOUR BEST FRIEND

17:47.566 --> 17:50.486
HAS ENDED UP IN
THAT CAVERNOUS ABDOMEN OF YOURS.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.321
- ROCKO!

17:52.404 --> 17:53.697
- AND YOU'VE GOT
NINE STOMACHS.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.825
HE'LL STARVE TO DEATH

17:56.909 --> 17:58.827
OF YOUR LABYRINTHIAN GUT!

17:58.911 --> 18:01.872
- STARVE!
OH, NO, ROCKO!

18:01.955 --> 18:07.753
NOT THAT!
NOT THAT!

18:07.836 --> 18:12.174
- HUH?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.592
- ROCKO, I'M SORRY!

18:13.675 --> 18:17.137
I'M SORRY!

18:17.221 --> 18:18.138
- COME, NOW.

18:21.975 --> 18:25.354
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR YOUR...

18:25.437 --> 18:27.231
ETERNAL PUNISHMENT!

18:34.321 --> 18:38.534
YOU WILL WATCH YOUR FRIEND
SLOWLY WASTE AWAY

18:38.617 --> 18:40.410
AND WHEN IT'S FINALLY OVER,

18:40.494 --> 18:42.746
YOU WILL WATCH IT IN RERUNS
AGAIN AND AGAIN

18:42.830 --> 18:45.582
FOR ALL ETERNITY!

18:45.666 --> 18:48.168
- ROCKO!

18:48.252 --> 18:50.295
- [evil laughter]

18:58.720 --> 19:01.932
- HANG IN THERE.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.433
ALMOST THERE.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.311
[heart beating]

19:15.821 --> 19:18.740
- DON'T WORRY, ROCKO, OLD BUDDY.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.451
I'M COMING!

19:21.535 --> 19:25.372
BANZAI!

19:25.455 --> 19:27.499

[belching]

19:42.431 --> 19:43.974
ROCKO!

19:44.057 --> 19:46.518
ROCKO, BUDDY, WE'RE ALIVE!

19:46.602 --> 19:49.271

19:52.232 --> 19:53.192
MY TREAT.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.738
IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO FOR...

19:57.821 --> 19:58.947
HEY, YOU DON'T
MIND STOPPING

19:59.031 --> 20:00.866
AT THE BEEF BARGE ON THE WAY,
DO YOU?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.075
I'M STARVED.

20:02.159 --> 20:06.163
- HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING?

20:06.246 --> 20:08.957
[evil laughter]

20:09.041 --> 20:12.794
- [screaming]

20:12.878 --> 20:14.796
OH, GEEZ.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.965
WHAT A NIGHTMARE!

20:17.049 --> 20:20.844
MAYBE I SHOULD LAY OFF

I LOVE CHOKEY CHICKEN!

21:11.937 --> 21:14.481
COULD WE PLEASE STOP THERE
ON THE WAY, ROCK?

21:14.564 --> 21:17.192
- OKAY, BUDDY, BUT WE'LL
HAVE TO MAKE IT QUICK.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.360
- OH, BOY!

21:18.443 --> 21:21.363
I'M GOING TO HAVE

21:33.709 --> 21:36.086
6-6-5...

21:36.169 --> 21:38.338
[frustrated groan]

21:38.422 --> 21:41.717
ONE, TWO,
