WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:04.662
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:04.738 --> 00:06.262
<i>Tool Time!</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:10.298
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.783
Hey. Thank you.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.676
Thank you all. Oh, please.

00:21.454 --> 00:24.753
<i>Thank you very much. Thank you, Heidi,
and welcome to Tool Time.</i>

00:24.824 --> 00:28.191
I am... hm...
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.796
Of course, you all know
my assistant, Al Borland.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.126
Wow.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.603
We have a very special show
for you today.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.675
Tim and I are proud to be building
something for my church.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.868
Thank you, Heidi.

00:43.943 --> 00:47.208
This cabinet will become
a place for the piscina.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.046
Be very careful. They're won'th a lot
of money, especially the old piscinas.

00:51.117 --> 00:53.085
You gotta make sure the piscina fits.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.987
The new modern piscinas aren't as nice
as the old piscinas, but be careful.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.117
You have no idea what a piscina is,
do you, Tim?

01:00.994 --> 01:02.325
No.

01:03.396 --> 01:07.423
A piscina is a special basin
used in the disposal of baptismal water,

01:07.500 --> 01:10.469
- leftover wine...
- And maybe those annoying oils?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.902
- Anointing oils.
- Those, too.

01:13.506 --> 01:16.441
So, basically, it's a sink.

01:16.509 --> 01:19.342
It's not an ordinary sink.
See, it has no faucets.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.245
So, it's not even as good as a sink.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.977
Why don't you take that up
with our special guest?

01:25.051 --> 01:27.076
<i>Let's have a warm Tool Time welcome</i>

01:27.153 --> 01:30.281
for the minister of
the St. Stephens Episcopal Church.

01:30.356 --> 01:33.450
Heidi, my minister please,
Father Mike Weber.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.438 --> 01:47.906
Father, it's really good
to have you on this show.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.842
<i>I wonder how you feel being the first
holy man to ever be on Tool Time.</i>

01:51.911 --> 01:54.641
Well, I'm not basking in the glory.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.773
I just hope I get out alive.

02:01.354 --> 02:05.415
You don't have much to worry about,
since you have an in with the big guy.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.551
And I'm not talking about Al.

02:09.461 --> 02:13.023
Father, I was trying to explain to Tim
exactly what a piscina is.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.863
- Would you care to elaborate?
- It's a sink.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.263
The difference is,
it's a sink that's been blessed.

02:22.342 --> 02:25.311
So, you need to find a blessed plumber.
That's hard.

02:25.378 --> 02:28.142
"Oh, Father, forgive me.
I've overcharged.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.739
Your trap wasrt stuck at all."

02:30.817 --> 02:34.685
You don't need a plumber, actually, Tim.
It's a very simple concept.

02:34.754 --> 02:37.780
It's a basin, with a pipe
that goes directly into the ground

02:37.857 --> 02:41.224
so that the sacred fluids
go right back into the earth.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.091
The piscina is a thousand year old
tradition in the church

02:44.197 --> 02:46.563
and it's symbolic
of many wondrous miracles.

02:46.633 --> 02:49.067
Thank you, Father.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.468
The most wonderful miracle is,
it's so simple to install,

02:54.541 --> 02:57.510
even you can't destroy it.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.571
We'll finish our installation here.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.344
We really appreciate this.
Al, thank you so much.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.441
Our pleasure.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.419
We're very excited
about receiving it on Sunday.

03:11.658 --> 03:15.389
Is there a special prayer you have
when a sacred object is destroyed?

03:15.461 --> 03:17.156
Yes, there is.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.528
You break it, you buy it.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.177
Breathe in and out.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.745
And in and out.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.313
Beautiful.

04:20.860 --> 04:25.422
Now, every yoga session ends
with a very special sensation.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.590
Pain?

04:27.667 --> 04:29.191
Inner peace.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.601
This exercise
is Uncle Wilsors favorite.

04:31.671 --> 04:36.233
<i>It's called Shava-asana.
Lie down in the position of a corpse.</i>

04:45.551 --> 04:48.019
You guys had
some of Mom's meatloaf, huh?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.423
I heard that.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.116
- Hey, Tim.
- Hello, Willow.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.423
You ever try yoga?

04:56.496 --> 05:00.523
Nope. No matter what they do to it,
it still doesn't taste like ice cream.

05:01.901 --> 05:05.359
Well, I hope you guys enjoyed
your first session.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.201
Yeah, I loved it.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.674
It's the first time I've ever seen
the back of my neck.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.075
Now that you've seen it, wash it.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.444
- See you guys.
- Where you going?

05:16.516 --> 05:19.451
To school to sign up
to volunteer at the hospice home.

05:19.519 --> 05:20.884
It's great you're doing it,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.956
but working with people who are dying
isn't gonna be easy.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.322
I know, but think
how tough things are for them.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.521
I could have never handled this
at your age. It's really cool.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.223
Dad, this isn't about cool.

05:32.298 --> 05:36.064
The concept of hospice is an alternative
to the medical establishment.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.694
Which is a greedy,
doctor-controlled bureaucracy

05:38.771 --> 05:41.262
that's death-oriented
instead of life-oriented.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.071
They never heat up
those rubber gloves, either.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.179
What will you be doing
at the hospice?

05:47.246 --> 05:49.976
I'll be spending my time
with a woman named Elaine.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.017
We'll play cards, watch videos.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.713
<i>Why don't you take her
some old Tool Time videos?</i>

05:54.787 --> 05:56.652
The woman has suffered enough.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.461
Hi, I'm here to see Elaine Jenkins.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.089
You must be Randy.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.430
Elaine's not back from her walk.
Have a seat.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.662
OK.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.742
Well, I was wondering where I left that.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.486
I also misplaced my darn seltzer bottle.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.860
I just keep losing all my props.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.831
- Wilson?
- No, no, no, not today.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.063
When I volunteer for the children
I am Bubbles the clown.

06:46.305 --> 06:49.069
Oh, Becky, would you like
to put these in some water?

06:49.175 --> 06:51.006
Bubbles, I don't have any water.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.635
Well, you do now.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.517
I didn't know you volunteered here
at the hospice.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.522
- Today's my first day.
- It's a wonderful place.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.423
I think you're gonna
get a lot of good stuff out of it.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.730
I don't know.
Ever since I got here I've been nervous.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.925
I don't want to say or do
the wrong thing.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.661
Ah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:16.736 --> 07:20.103
<i>You know, Randy,
I'm reminded of the Book of Sirach,</i>

07:20.173 --> 07:23.836
which says a faithful friend
is a medicine for life.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.811
So, I should just relax
and try to be supportive?

07:26.879 --> 07:30.940
Exactly. If you want you can always
borrow my size 52 clodhoppers.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.110
They're a great icebreaker.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.212
Well, hello, ladies.
How are you?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.950
See you, Randy.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.822
- Randy, Elaine's back from her walk.
- Oh.

07:41.761 --> 07:45.253
Hi. I'm Randy Taylor. Are you OK?
Do you want to sit down?

07:45.331 --> 07:48.300
I probably should
after that two mile power walk,

07:48.367 --> 07:50.699
but she's Elaine.
I work here.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.562
She's my nurse.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.700
I keep telling her to live life
and get off her bony butt.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.144
Wow. You power walk?

08:02.215 --> 08:04.979
I also dress myself
and cut my own meat.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.619
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Hey.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.749
I'm having fun with you.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.386
- Arert I allowed to have fun?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.225
Fun, fun, fun!

08:18.931 --> 08:21.798
Well, Randy,
would you like to see this place?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.893
Sure. I'm dying to.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.933
I mean, I'd love to.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.278
- This is home.
- It's very nice.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.645
Thank you.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.083
Is this your family?

08:40.620 --> 08:45.114
Yes. That's my son, Steven
and my daughter, Nancy.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.819
- Both asked me to move in with them.
- Why didn't you?

08:49.896 --> 08:53.195
Well, one lives in California
and one lives in Florida.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.693
I hate surfing and old people.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.696
You know, the worst
is old people who surf.

09:02.642 --> 09:06.100
Get out of
my pipeline. I'm surfing here.

09:07.880 --> 09:13.011
I am staying here in Detroit
until the Lions win a Super Bowl.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.918
You're gonna be here awhile.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.922
I'm counting on it.

09:18.524 --> 09:22.483
You know, Randy, when the doctors
diagnosed me with cancer,

09:22.595 --> 09:25.155
they said I only had six months to live.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.391
That was three years ago.

09:27.466 --> 09:30.799
- That's fantastic.
- Doctors! What do they know?

09:30.870 --> 09:32.098
Tell me about it.

09:32.171 --> 09:35.402
They run 400 tests,
come up with their expert diagnosis,

09:35.474 --> 09:38.102
toss people in the hospital
for thousands of dollars.

09:38.177 --> 09:41.544
If they're not sick enough to die,
they've got no money left to live.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.615
You seem a little bitter.

09:46.352 --> 09:49.617
I've been reading about
the health care crisis in this country.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.247
It just makes me really mad.

09:51.324 --> 09:55.192
It is so refreshing
to meet a young person

09:55.261 --> 09:58.822
who has such strong
convictions and beliefs.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.366
I've been questioning
a lot of things lately.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.800
Corruption of
the political establishment,

10:03.903 --> 10:05.871
lack of ethics
in corporate America,

10:05.938 --> 10:08.099
hypocrisy of organized religion.

10:08.174 --> 10:12.042
There are just so many things in
this world that people follow blindly.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.443
Never be a follower.

10:15.047 --> 10:18.141
You stick to your guns
and don't ever lose your fire.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.242
You sure haven't lost yours.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.253
Well, that's what keeps me going.

10:22.321 --> 10:26.553
That, and hiding props
from that annoying clown.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.059
Oh, hi. How did it go at the hospice?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.398
Unbelievable.
Elaine was so full of life.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.835
She was an inspiration.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.371
Speaking of inspiration,

10:40.439 --> 10:43.374
Al has invited us
to his church this Sunday.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.603
They're honoring your father's sink.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.874
It's not a sink.
It's an extremely religious basin.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.541
It's called a Pasadena.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.980
Look, uh...

10:59.058 --> 11:02.425
I don't want to make a big deal
out of this, but I'm not going Sunday.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.794
- Do you have to work at the hospice?
- No.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.959
Does going to Al's church
make you a little uncomfortable?

11:09.035 --> 11:11.503
No. Going to any church
makes me uncomfortable.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.800
I've been thinking
and I just realized

11:13.873 --> 11:16.364
organized religion
doesn't make any sense to me.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.900
It doesn't make any sense to anyone,
but they still go to church.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.745
Randy, this family's
always gone to church together.

11:24.817 --> 11:28.344
I know, but for a long time
I've been questioning why I'm there.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.948
Question all you want to,
as long as your butt's in that pew.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.585
Dad, I just believe people can
experience God in different ways.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.027
Does this have anything
to do with the hospice?

11:38.130 --> 11:42.897
Yeah. Being there reminded me how
important it is to question things.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.563
The answers don't have anything
to do with organized religion.

11:46.672 --> 11:50.506
I think it's great that you're examining
your life on a deeper level.

11:50.576 --> 11:54.137
Are you sure that you want to abandon
everything you've believed in?

11:54.213 --> 11:57.478
- Especially a religion.
- Dad, I'm not abandoning God.

11:57.550 --> 12:02.112
It's just, sitting in that church
goes against my convictions and beliefs.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.946
Convictions and beliefs?

12:05.024 --> 12:07.185
What do they have to do with religion?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.796
What makes Randy think he can get away
with not going to church?

12:13.866 --> 12:16.494
I don't think he's trying
to get away with anything.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.333
Randy's wrestling with major
philosophical issues.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.430
We can't force him to share our beliefs.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.772
We're gonna have to be open-minded
and allow him to find his own.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.404
What if he starts
believing something we don't like?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.971
What if he joins a cult
that worships chicken parts?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.949
He'll never go hungry.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.485
I don't think this is real funny, Jill.

12:34.553 --> 12:38.216
What is this?
You're not exactly Mr. Religious.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.554
Half the time in church you fall asleep.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.787
But I'm in the building,
so I get credit.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.460
Is that what this is about?

12:46.565 --> 12:48.692
- That's God's plan.
- God's plan?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.793
Yes, you go to church, you get credit.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.701
You fall asleep, you lose a credit.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.706
You understand the sermon,
you get extra credit.

12:56.776 --> 13:01.304
If you get enough credits, you can
bypass hell and upgrade right to heaven.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.280
That's a real spiritual approach.

13:03.349 --> 13:07.012
My parents forced me to go to church
and I'm a better person because of it.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.782
My parents forced me.
I'm a better person in spite of it.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.720
So, either way it works, huh?

13:13.759 --> 13:16.785
Man, I'm never doing yoga again.

13:16.862 --> 13:20.923
Hey, Dad, you know a lot about pain.
What do you do for back spasms?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.264
I go to church and I don't ask why.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.132
Gin.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.941
One, two. Well...

13:33.012 --> 13:35.913
You owe me $362,000.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.648
- Settle for a stick of gum?
- No.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.482
Cash or your pants.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.955
I'll owe ya.
You're one heck of a card player.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.188
That's what they said in Vegas.

13:50.262 --> 13:53.720
Before they kicked me out
for counting cards.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.768
Luckily, I got a gig driving a truck.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.667
Wait a second.
You drove a big rig?

13:58.737 --> 14:00.466
An 18-wheeler.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.067
I met my husband
at a truck stop in Reno.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.977
I divorced him at the next one.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.741
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.011
No.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.851
- Is any of this true?
- Some of it.

14:21.227 --> 14:24.560
- You ever been to Vegas?
- Yeah. Went last year.

14:24.630 --> 14:28.259
Got a fake i.d., hooked up
with a showgirl, and won 12 grand.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.598
- Any of that true?
- Not a word.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.536
Come in.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.435
Well, hi-ho!

14:37.543 --> 14:41.104
Well, clowny,
you just come right in here.

14:41.180 --> 14:44.616
I think somebody
wants to be entertained.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.844
Well, entertain this.

14:50.756 --> 14:53.520
Great news.
I have a date for Saturday night.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.787
Oh, yeah?
Where are you and your mom going?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.455
No, no.

14:58.564 --> 15:02.125
My date's name is Gina and I'm gonna be
double dating with a friend.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.294
- Hey, Al. All set.
- There he is. Right.

15:05.371 --> 15:09.432
Gina can't wait to meet you. The four
of us are going to the Blues Barrel.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.408
I dig the blues.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.138
<i>* Ba da da da dah</i>

15:13.212 --> 15:15.840
<i>* I was born on a Monday</i>

15:15.915 --> 15:17.576
<i>* Ba da da da dah</i>

15:17.650 --> 15:20.175
<i>* It sure was a fun day</i>

15:20.252 --> 15:22.482
Hey, this is working.

15:22.554 --> 15:24.852
Now I got the blues.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.652
Wait a minute.
You two are double dating?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.251
Why? Don't you think
a minister can go have fun?

15:30.329 --> 15:31.887
Not with Al.

15:33.198 --> 15:37.362
After the blues club maybe we can go to
Mr. Tasty's for some soft-serve cones.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.734
All right, you wild man!
Come on!

15:40.873 --> 15:42.602
Gina will love that. She's big.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.142
All right.

15:44.209 --> 15:47.474
- I'll dig you later.
- We'll have fun Saturday.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.480
- The piscina looks great.
- Thanks.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.914
I hope you and your family
come to the dedication.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.951
Yeah, me too. Um...

15:54.653 --> 15:56.814
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.990
Want me to bless the flathead?

16:01.060 --> 16:05.156
Not today. I'm having a little trouble
with my 15-year-old son.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.391
- Is it serious?
- I think so.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.402
He's having a problem with your boss.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.628
The bishop?

16:14.440 --> 16:15.566
The boss?

16:16.375 --> 16:18.138
Springsteen?

16:19.545 --> 16:20.637
His boss.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.011
- Oh, oh.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.108
He doesn't want to go to church.
I don't know how to make him.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.313
Make him go?
I've got a teenage son.

16:29.388 --> 16:32.050
- Can't make a 15-year-old do anything.
- Yeah.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.682
That's what I'm afraid of.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.159
But if I don't try,
then the kid may...

16:37.229 --> 16:39.993
- Wind up on the wrong path?
- Well...

16:40.065 --> 16:44.161
It's like he's been cruising along 275
in a great line,

16:44.236 --> 16:48.570
then all of a sudden he gets off an exit
and there he is, on Telegraph.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.006
Yeah. Potholes, permanent construction.

16:52.745 --> 16:56.010
- I used to race on Telegraph.
- There were some sporting races.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.983
One night some kid took this beautiful
Chevelle Super Sport, a '67.

17:00.052 --> 17:03.715
He just corkscrewed off a turn
and the idiot wrecked it.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.117
I was there.
I was there, yeah.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.752
That was a cherry car. The guy must
have built it but he couldn't handle it.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.762
No, no, no, he could handle it. Look.

17:11.829 --> 17:16.130
It was a '68, it was a Nova, and the kid
did all... Let's talk about Randy!

17:19.405 --> 17:20.872
Tell me a bit about him.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.429
- He's a great kid.
- Mm-hmm.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.669
He does stuff
I would never think of doing.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.540
At 15 I was always spending time
around garages.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.639
Every day...
Except Sunday morning.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.842
Yeah.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.551
Let me ask you, what kind of stuff
does he do in his spare time?

17:36.622 --> 17:39.090
Volunteers.
Last year he worked at a soup kitchen.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.592
This year he's volunteering
at a hospice house.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.594
- That's very admirable.
- Yeah.

17:43.662 --> 17:47.325
What kind of stuff do you do
in your spare time, Tim?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.763
Well, I work on the hot rod here.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.862
I'm gonna drop this flathead
into a '46 Ford convertible.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.430
- That's gonna cook, man.
- Yeah.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.442
It's kind of funny, you know.

17:58.510 --> 18:02.674
Some people, uh, take their spare time
and work on their cars

18:02.748 --> 18:05.080
and go to church on Sunday.

18:05.617 --> 18:09.053
Others take their spare time
to help their fellow man

18:09.621 --> 18:12.146
and then choose not to go to church.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.318
Are you saying I'm not
as good a Christian as my kid?

18:15.394 --> 18:18.761
- It's not a contest.
- If it were, who would get better odds?

18:18.864 --> 18:20.695
Look, I'm not the Lord's bookie.

18:22.968 --> 18:27.598
I'm sure you're familiar with the last
words of a typical Episcopalian service?

18:27.673 --> 18:30.938
"We're number one!"

18:31.009 --> 18:35.378
What I always say is, "Go in peace
to love and serve the Lord".

18:36.648 --> 18:39.549
If you think about it,
that's what Randy's doing, isn't it?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.245
I never thought of it that way.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.380
- He's in good shape.
- Thanks for talking to me.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.720
- OK, sure. Well, see you Sunday.
- You bet.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.522
Unless I find some other way
to do the Lord's work.

18:50.762 --> 18:54.528
Nice try, but I don't think dropping
a flathead into a convertible

18:54.633 --> 18:57.101
qualifies as the Lord's work.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.399
Unless you donate the car to me.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.469
- See you Sunday.
- See you Sunday.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.042
- Hey, Becky.
- Oh, Randy, hold on a sec.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.141
Elaine can't see anybody today.

19:13.218 --> 19:17.177
- When should I come back?
- She took a turn for the worse.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.348
She doesn't want visitors anymore.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.054
But, I mean, come on, it's me.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.363
I'm her gin partner.
I gotta win my money back.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.796
I know.
Listen, she told me to give you this.

19:44.950 --> 19:48.647
So, what did Father Mike say
that changed your mind?

19:48.720 --> 19:51.951
Well, he made me understand that
even though Randy has a problem

19:52.024 --> 19:56.791
with organized religion, volunteering
is his way of going to church.

19:57.663 --> 20:00.689
- Thought I should be more open-minded.
- That's what I said.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.998
I know, but it had more impact
coming from a minister

20:05.070 --> 20:07.334
who bar hops with Al.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.609
Just the man I want to talk to.
Randy, hold on a sec.

20:11.677 --> 20:15.306
I think I understand how you feel
about not going to church.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.314
That's great, Dad.

20:17.382 --> 20:21.546
- Is there something wrong?
- Elaine didn't want to see me.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.882
Why not?

20:22.955 --> 20:26.015
Doctor said
she took a turn for the worse.

20:26.091 --> 20:27.718
Oh, Randy.

20:27.793 --> 20:31.559
It's amazing. It's just like yesterday
she's sitting there laughing,

20:31.630 --> 20:35.259
telling me stories,
hiding the whoopee cushion from Wilson.

20:35.968 --> 20:40.701
I know it's not easy, but you knew
something like this was gonna happen.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.296
I thought I did.

20:42.374 --> 20:45.605
I guess I convinced myself
that my spending time with Elaine

20:45.677 --> 20:47.508
would make some kind of difference.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.843
Hey, come on, buddy.
You made a difference.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.611
You brought a lot of happiness
into her life.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.914
Yeah, but she's still gonna die.

20:55.621 --> 20:58.784
You know, here I think I have
all my beliefs figured out.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.356
It's sure not working for me now.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.692
It's not easy for anybody
to understand sickness and death.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.733
We spend our whole lives
trying to figure stuff like this out.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.702
I've spent a long time trying to
understand why my father died so young.

21:13.705 --> 21:17.038
- How'd you ever get through it?
- Patience, grieving,

21:17.109 --> 21:18.269
a little bit of prayer.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.902
Maybe I should say a prayer for Elaine.

21:20.979 --> 21:23.072
It would be a good idea.

21:23.148 --> 21:27.482
There's a place where people get
together and pray for God's protection.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.816
Dad, I'm not going to church.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.719
<i>I was talking about Tool Time.</i>

21:35.394 --> 21:37.760
This is really cool
that you're doing this.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.888
Dad, this isn't about cool.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.195
I mean, the whole s... Um... Sorry!

21:45.470 --> 21:48.598
Dad, this is more than cool.
That's not it, either.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.141
This isn't about cool.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.076
This isn't about cool.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.744
I can't look at him!

21:58.817 --> 22:00.341
Just hold that there.
