Nostradamus said

I just wish that

To two months ago,

01:19.180 --> 01:20.846
Me in my wedding gown,

01:20.848 --> 01:23.182
Walking down the aisle
to you at notre dame.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.284
But instead, we have
to come back to reality.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.319
That's what

(sighs)

01:27.321 --> 01:29.855
Politics,
backstabbing, murder.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.291
Just another day
at french court.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.561
Francis, can
we turn around

01:35.563 --> 01:37.329
And go back to the
country house at anet?

01:37.331 --> 01:42.568
Everything we felt there
alone, away from court.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.304
Somehow our love seems
so fragile, suddenly.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.372
Things are different now.

01:47.374 --> 01:51.110
We're married--
the future king and queen.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.612
My mother is no longer

Hmm.

01:53.614 --> 01:57.516
Nostradamus's prophecy
no longer a threat.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.785
And bash is far away in Spain.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.354
I hope he's safe,

02:02.356 --> 02:03.789
And that he
finds happiness.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.226
Well, there is something

02:07.228 --> 02:09.862
That everyone will want from us
that we can agree on.

02:09.864 --> 02:12.297

02:34.722 --> 02:40.225
The last thing either of us
wants is a senseless, costly war

02:40.227 --> 02:43.462
Caused by a tragic mistake.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.763
A french ship firing

02:44.765 --> 02:46.298
Upon a bohemian vessel
without provocation?

02:46.300 --> 02:49.168
Yes, that is indeed a mistake.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.504
But not a mistake of intent.
An accident.

02:53.873 --> 02:56.341
France is very sorry,

02:56.343 --> 02:58.844
And will do all it can

peaceful and prosperous

03:01.282 --> 03:04.783
Friendship with the
great nation of bohemia.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.188
In keeping with our agreement

03:09.190 --> 03:11.256
That I provide
a new suitor each week...

03:11.258 --> 03:12.658
While I provide you

03:12.660 --> 03:14.593
With an infinite amount
of carnal pleasure?

03:14.595 --> 03:15.928
Who is it
this time?

03:15.930 --> 03:17.462
The last one was
simple-minded.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.964
The one before that
smelled of vinegar

03:18.966 --> 03:20.399
And had an
abundance of earwax.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.967
Well, he also had
an abundance of land.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.468
But no matter.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.970
I'm sure
the archduke of bohemia

03:24.972 --> 03:26.805
Will keep up
to your high standards.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.340
The archduke?

03:28.342 --> 03:31.210
What's wrong
with him?

03:31.212 --> 03:32.544
He's perfect.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.746
He's clearly attracted to you.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.482
He's a foreigner, so
he doesn't know your reputation.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.618
He'll take you far,
far away from me.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.720
There's only one difficulty.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.889
The archduke is a pious man.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.758
He'll expect his new bride
to be chaste.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.293
A virgin?

03:48.295 --> 03:49.861
Everybody knows that...

03:49.863 --> 03:51.363
I'm the king;
I'll make sure

03:51.365 --> 03:53.332
No one mentions
your lack of virtue to him.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.634
You want me to trick a deeply
religious man into marrying me?

03:55.636 --> 03:57.903
If your conscience
won't permit it...
My lord,

03:57.905 --> 04:00.872
Would you please present me
to our distinguished visitor?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.507
Archduke ferdinand.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.875
The lady kenna.

04:05.945 --> 04:08.580
I'll leave you to it, then, hmm?

04:10.283 --> 04:13.418
I'm delighted
to meet you, lady kenna.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.920
Oh, the delight is all mine.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.855
You'll have to excuse my nerves,
of course.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.591
I'm not used to the attentions
of such a powerful man.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.526
(clears throat)

04:21.528 --> 04:24.263
(horns play fanfare, applause)

04:24.265 --> 04:26.331
I missed you all!

04:29.435 --> 04:30.936
You both look happy.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.971
We were. We are.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.341
I'm sure we'll be just as
happy here as we were in paris,

04:36.343 --> 04:39.311
And anet, and every castle
from here to the loire valley.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.946
Oh, which reminds me.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.415
I found a wonderful
suitor for you, greer.
Oh.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.618
And there's one in paris who
is very keen to meet you, lola.

04:48.721 --> 04:49.955
Wonderful.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.423
Catherine:
Mary!

04:51.425 --> 04:52.891
Oh, how I've missed you.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.828
Ah.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.430
A word.

04:58.432 --> 05:02.567
And so the politics
and backstabbing begin.

05:05.938 --> 05:09.708
You must tell me all
about your travels... Later.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.077
First, you need to know

05:12.079 --> 05:14.546
That your bastard brother
didn't make it to Spain.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.782
What do you mean?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.450
I sent those guards
with him myself.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.352
They were supposed to
accompany him to a ship

05:20.354 --> 05:21.687
And see him
safely on board.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.055
The bodies of those men you sent

05:23.057 --> 05:24.790
Were found by the side
of the road,

05:24.792 --> 05:26.825
Not long after you left
for your honeymoon.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.493
But bash's body
was not found?

05:28.495 --> 05:30.996
Either he killed
the guards himself,

05:30.998 --> 05:34.366
Or the whole party was attacked,
and he managed to escape.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.834
Are they looking for him?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.503
Of course. Henry has his men
looking everywhere.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.372
Aren't you glad
you have a mother

05:40.374 --> 05:42.541
Who pays attention
to such things?

05:58.758 --> 06:00.659
(groans)

06:01.461 --> 06:02.728
(panting)

06:02.730 --> 06:04.863
You are a...

06:04.865 --> 06:06.732
Hunter. Yes, you fool.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.901
Have I offended you?

06:09.903 --> 06:14.373
What kind of a fool
can't recognize

06:14.375 --> 06:16.475
A boar trap?

06:17.810 --> 06:21.046
The embarrassed kind?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.815
If you were such a tracker,
didn't you think it strange

06:23.817 --> 06:26.017
That there were leaves
on a patch of snow

06:26.019 --> 06:27.819
Surrounded by evergreens?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.703
(chickens clucking)

06:48.074 --> 06:50.075
Who's this then?

06:50.077 --> 06:53.578
Bash, my brother carrick.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.114
Bash tried to
ruin my boar trap.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.682
I would have
seen it.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.084
She tackled me
prematurely.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.186
Rowan (laughs):
Then we competed

07:01.188 --> 07:03.822
To see who could shoot
the most pheasants.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.059
Be nice, carrick.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.795
He's a guest.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.633
Well, guest...

07:14.635 --> 07:17.536
You're the first man
my sister's ever brought home.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.071
Don't worry. I'm not staying.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.606
Ah.
I'm just a hunter
passing through.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.008
Really? To where?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.110
(leaves rustling)

07:31.017 --> 07:33.518
Carrick:
It's the boar.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.687
(panting)
wait!

07:35.689 --> 07:37.656
(gasping)
my god.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.191
Olivia?

07:42.562 --> 07:44.696
It fits perfectly!
Thank you!

07:44.698 --> 07:46.531
I love mine.
How utterly virginal.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.866
And utterly ironic.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.868
(laughter)

07:49.870 --> 07:52.003
Oh, you're not wearing
your gown, lola.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.707
Uh, it's incredibly lovely,
but I'm afraid it's a bit snug.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.909
Oh, don't worry. We'll have
the seamstresses work on it.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.678
So, mary, tell us,
are you pregnant?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.179
Greer!

08:01.181 --> 08:02.747
It's been almost
two months.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.149
You know everyone's
wondering.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.685
Two months
isn't very long.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.224
I thought you loved marzipan.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.266
Lola, are you all right?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.835
Perfectly fine.
Thanks.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.509
How do you know her?

08:30.511 --> 08:33.178
Beneath the dirt, this
dress is fine silk.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.514
It would take
weeks to weave.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.516
Only a noble could afford
to buy it.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.123
Carrick.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.193
The girl's been fed on.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.661
She can't stay.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.296
And what do you suggest I do?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.064
Throw her back
into the woods to die?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.733
She needs help, a physician.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.636
This is our home.
You get her out of here.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.071
No! No!

09:00.073 --> 09:02.073
(whimpers)
olivia, it's all right.
It's all right.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.543
T-take my blood!
Olivia!

09:04.545 --> 09:06.545
(whimpering)
rowan:
She's been chosen.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.612
(olivia sighs)

09:08.748 --> 09:11.149
She's been touched
by the darkness.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.253
I've been a widower
over a year.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.289
My advisors are
constantly pressuring me

09:17.291 --> 09:18.857
To find a new wife.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.225
You poor dear.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.595
How absolutely awful.

09:23.597 --> 09:28.033
I was just wondering
how you feel about an older...

09:28.035 --> 09:31.036
More experienced
suitor?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.637
Well, I must admit

09:32.639 --> 09:34.773
That the thought makes
my heart beat faster.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.107
Is that wrong to admit?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.709
Is it sinful?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.144
I just... I don't know.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.745
(laughs)

09:40.747 --> 09:44.249
There. Why, you sweet
young thing.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.753
(sighs)

09:48.755 --> 09:50.589
Your majesty,

09:50.591 --> 09:53.124
It pleases me
that the relationship

09:53.126 --> 09:57.295
Between our nations is so...

09:57.297 --> 09:58.997
Congenial!

09:58.999 --> 10:02.300
Do you worry
for your reputation?

10:02.302 --> 10:05.270
Yes, but...
More than that.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.807
Uh... This...

10:08.809 --> 10:11.176
Is god's vessel.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.778
I need to make sure
that I'm pure

10:13.780 --> 10:16.348
For the man I choose
to devote my life to.

10:16.350 --> 10:20.218
What a relief to find a woman
who understands that.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.955
Oh, you must meet my sister--
you are cut from the same cloth.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.694

10:30.663 --> 10:31.997

Laudanum is difficult

And olivia d'amencourt,
I thought, had left court.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.778
What happened
to the poor girl?
She was wandering

11:19.780 --> 11:21.446
The woods in a confused
and terrified state.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.314
The slashes
she did herself.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.016
Poor child.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.851
These aren't slashes,
they're bite marks.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.921
But are they
animal or human?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.456
I don't know.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.991
I was told she was chosen.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.160
Is it possible that
she had an encounter

11:35.162 --> 11:37.862
With whatever it is the pagans
are worshipping in the woods?

11:37.864 --> 11:40.365
Whatever thing is, that
creature that requires blood.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.767
I don't believe
in such beings.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.070
Well, nor did I,
and yet here she is.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.972
I don't believe there are things
that require blood.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.307
You don't believe
there's a dark,

11:49.309 --> 11:50.709
Malignant power in the woods?

11:50.711 --> 11:53.011
Nature is not malignant.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.980
Nature doesn't care.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.183
Only humans are malignant.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.885
There's nothing evil
in the woods.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.254
Unless it comes from us.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.756
Olivia!

12:04.758 --> 12:06.124
(spasmodic gasping)
can you hear me?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.026
Can you help her?
I can try.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.995
I'll tell no one she's here
for now-- she needs rest

12:10.997 --> 12:13.131
And gentle treatment,
not a dozen questioners.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.866
You should leave.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.901
It's not safe
for you here.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.472
(door opens)

12:21.440 --> 12:23.007
You asked to see me?

12:23.009 --> 12:24.876
Ah, mary. Mm.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.245
My dear, now that
we're fast friends,

12:27.247 --> 12:29.748
I'd like to help
you with something

12:29.750 --> 12:31.015
Of the utmost importance.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.450
Babies.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.285
Excuse me?

12:34.287 --> 12:36.020
Your duty, in case

12:36.022 --> 12:38.189
You are unaware, is
to produce an heir

12:38.191 --> 12:39.924
And ensure the future
of your line.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.926
Yes, I am well aware of that.
Thank you.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.863
And yet you stand before
me looking svelte.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.066
You aren't pregnant,
are you?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.068
We only just got back,

12:50.070 --> 12:51.469
And we haven't been
married for very long.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.239
Rub this on your chest
ten minutes before lovemaking.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.242
It may burn.
Ignore it.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.110
And this on his...

13:00.312 --> 13:02.247
Well, you know.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.449
When you detect interest.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.553
After... Lie absolutely
still for an hour,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.855
And then take two of these.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.525
(gasps)
no, not these.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.226
These were
in the wrong cabinet.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.162
Never touch these.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.398
Excuse me.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.900
I need to speak with my queen.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.901
Privately.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.170
Yes, of course.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.174
(door closes)

13:29.176 --> 13:31.042
(sighs)
what's wrong?

13:31.044 --> 13:34.045
I was with the duchess
in my chambers.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.246
Mm-hmm.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.015
As we were...

13:37.017 --> 13:39.217
Engaged in conversation,
we happened to move...

13:39.219 --> 13:40.852
Close to the window and...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.054
And what?

13:43.056 --> 13:45.056
She caught cold?

13:45.058 --> 13:46.391
She fell.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.093
To her death.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.463
My god. Henry!

13:52.465 --> 13:54.432
We're trying
to avoid

13:54.434 --> 13:56.167
A war with these people.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.537
Does the archduke know?
Not yet.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.540
Why are you coming to me?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.109
Shouldn't you be crafting
strategy with your advisors?

14:05.111 --> 14:06.611
I can't trust them.
What if they

14:06.613 --> 14:08.613
Use this against me?
And this could mean war.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.415
(laughs)
yes, it could.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.017
And no one knows
how to cover up a problem

14:13.019 --> 14:14.285
Better than you.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.487
You are my...

14:17.890 --> 14:20.291
You are France's best hope.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.629
Forget France.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.866
Oh, you just want me
to have blood on my hands, too.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.434
A way to keep me silent.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.169
It's a practical solution.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.104
For you.
What's in it for me?

14:36.242 --> 14:38.576
I want chenonceau.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.978
I gave that to diane.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.646
You want me
to take back a gift?

14:41.648 --> 14:43.047
She loves that chateau.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.049
Bring your mistress
back to court, then,

14:45.051 --> 14:47.285
And let her deal
with your dead duchess.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.188
Let her aid in moving a body
and crafting

14:50.190 --> 14:52.423
A story...
Very well. Chenonceau.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.425
But no one else
can know.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.527
Only the two of us.
No servants,

14:56.529 --> 14:59.297
No... Trusted advisors.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.933
Don't try to school
a professional, henry.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.035
(exhales)

15:05.971 --> 15:07.605
Lola, I think
we need to talk

15:07.607 --> 15:09.607
About your liaison
with francis in paris.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.609
Kenna, I can't do this
right now.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.945
Because you're tired.
You've been tired a lot.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.481
You're pale, you're not eating,
your new gown doesn't fit.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.284
You acted so strangely when
you were at home with francis.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.451
You're pregnant, aren't you?

15:23.555 --> 15:24.622
Fast work.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.090
Well done!

15:26.092 --> 15:27.692
There is no
better way

15:27.694 --> 15:29.627
For a royal mistress
to secure her place.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.095
Look at diane.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.231
If I could have managed
it, but the king

15:33.233 --> 15:35.300
Is well versed
in avoiding such issues.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.135
Don't congratulate me.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.437
I'm not francis's mistress.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.973
It was one night.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.975
A-a moment of comfort.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.576
Do you have any idea

15:45.578 --> 15:47.679
How this will shame
my family in scotland?

15:47.681 --> 15:49.681
And what will it do to mary?

15:49.683 --> 15:51.382
I understand that
you're worried.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.284
Mary won't take it
well, not at first.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.687
But think of it-- in
time, she'll recover,

15:55.689 --> 15:57.388
And francis will be
a loving father.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.190
He'd want the child
to grow up here,

15:59.192 --> 16:01.426
And he'd probably
let you raise it.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.962
Let me?
I'm the child's mother.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.130
Yes, well, I'm sure that
you would play some part.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.067
As long as you don't anger mary
and you keep francis's interest.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.568
Regardless,

16:10.570 --> 16:12.503
Lola, your position
at french court

16:12.505 --> 16:14.005
Is assured for life.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.540
For life?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.442
But as what?

16:19.278 --> 16:21.512
Kenna, I can't do this.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.648
What are you saying?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.417
There are people who help women
who don't want babies.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.721
Everyone knows they exist.
I-I just don't know any.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.991
Did you... Have you ever...

16:32.993 --> 16:34.625
Ended a pregnancy? No.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.628
The king is well stocked
to avoid such issues.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.364
Well stocked with...?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.499
Well, he covers... It...

16:41.501 --> 16:43.701
If you don't know, you
shouldn't be having sex!

16:47.539 --> 16:49.107
(sighs)

16:50.676 --> 16:53.644
All right. Uh...

16:53.646 --> 16:56.180
One of the servants-- a
girl who washes my things--

16:56.182 --> 16:58.082
She isn't married,
but she seemed to be

16:58.084 --> 16:59.584
With child a
few months ago.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.220
She disappeared
for a few days,

17:02.222 --> 17:05.189
And when she came back, she
was thinner, less troubled.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.491
Who is she?

17:06.493 --> 17:08.760
Tell me, please.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.706
Bash.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.474
You're supposed to be in Spain.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.642
I'm supposed to be dead.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.310
The night
francis's men

17:26.312 --> 17:27.745
Were escorting me
out of the country,

17:27.747 --> 17:31.049
They tried to kill me--
on his orders, I believe.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.051
Oh, francis wouldn't--
you know that.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.119
Really? After we
put him through hell,

17:35.121 --> 17:36.754
Dispossessed him of everything?

17:36.756 --> 17:39.390
After he saw our feelings
for each other

17:39.392 --> 17:41.492
When he returned?
After he stopped our marriage?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.327
He still values you
as his brother.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.629
I am nothing to him.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.097
Nothing but a threat.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.498
He made that very clear.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.100
Well, you're
married now.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.502
All of that is behind us,
all of that pain.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.671
Was it only pain we left behind?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.606
There was something more
between us.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.476
Francis knows that;
he hates it.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.244
He's come to hate me.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.746
He still wouldn't
have you killed.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.315
Not in a flash of anger?
Of jealousy?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.184
That's all it
would have taken--

18:06.186 --> 18:09.454
A wave of the future king's
head, a nod to some guards,

18:09.456 --> 18:10.855
And his intent,
however fleeting,

18:10.857 --> 18:12.790
Would have resulted in my death.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.326
Don't you want
to know the truth?

18:15.328 --> 18:19.297
No proof, one way or the
other, would change anything.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.166
It might change
your heart.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.835
And it would change
francis's life,

18:23.837 --> 18:26.871
Because if I learn that
he did try to kill me,

18:26.873 --> 18:28.406
I will take him down myself.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.707
Bash, watch your words!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.309
This threat alone

18:31.311 --> 18:33.244
Could result in your death.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.213
Francis is my husband.

18:35.215 --> 18:39.183
For your own sake,
for your own doubt,

18:39.185 --> 18:41.552
Find out who
you're married to.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.895
If you need me,
put a light in your window,

18:50.897 --> 18:52.597
And I'll meet you
in the woods...

18:52.599 --> 18:56.167
Where we first kissed.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.736
(door closes)

18:59.705 --> 19:02.773
It's leaving a stain.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.842
Why is this so difficult?

19:04.844 --> 19:07.311
Our clothes go away dirty
and they come back clean--

19:07.313 --> 19:08.579
How do <i>they</i> do it?

19:08.581 --> 19:09.514
I don't know.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.815
They take them

19:10.817 --> 19:12.316
To the laundry, and...

19:12.318 --> 19:14.719
They dip them in something.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.389
Oh. Be sure to pick up
all the solid bits.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.761
If we're lucky, it'll
look like spilled wine.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.837
Roll it forward.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.806
The way my chefs do
stuffed pastry.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.345
Now... There.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.481
Now, all we have to do

19:43.483 --> 19:45.449
Is get her back to
her chambers, and...

19:45.451 --> 19:49.187
Toss her out of
the proper window.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.956
Oh, this was my
favorite coverlet.

19:53.892 --> 19:56.861
Add it to the list
of my debts to you.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.230
You're mistaken,
my lady, I never...
Please.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.831
My friend needs your compassion.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.636
It's dangerous,
casting off a babe.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.238
I understand.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.607
No. Truly dangerous.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.442
Not just to your reputation.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.645
I was warned
many girls don't survive.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.880
You did.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.448
You look healthy.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.450
I was lucky.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.320
I'd never have done it
if I hadn't been desperate.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.389
Tell me where you went.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.427
My friend is desperate, too.

20:30.762 --> 20:33.464
My lady, we both know
there's no friend.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.467
If I tell you,

20:36.469 --> 20:38.869
If you never
come back...

20:41.406 --> 20:43.407
(gasps)

20:43.409 --> 20:45.543
This could keep my family
for months.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.414
My lady, it's wrong to tempt me
to do what could harm you.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.985
If there is harm,
let it be on me.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.628
(sighs)
(voices in distance)

21:03.630 --> 21:05.730
(sighs)
I know, I know.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.532
She's... Heavier
than she looked.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.372
Nostradamus?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.775
Are you here?

21:27.386 --> 21:29.787
(soft panting, crying)

21:42.668 --> 21:44.669
Wake up, my child. Wake up.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.737
Wake up. I dismiss the demons

21:46.739 --> 21:48.939
That trouble
your sleep.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.342
(panting)

22:12.798 --> 22:14.899
Wait until you hear
the conversation I had

22:14.901 --> 22:16.467
With your mother today.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.935
I'd rather hear
about the conversation

22:17.937 --> 22:19.870
You had with my guards.

22:19.872 --> 22:23.007
You wanted to know my orders
for bash's departure.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.676
I knew that you would
hear about that.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.014
I'm sorry,
but I-I have to ask you,

22:30.016 --> 22:32.883
Did you order your guards
to kill bash?

22:32.885 --> 22:35.753
Who put this idea
into your head?

22:36.722 --> 22:38.689
Bash believes it was your doing.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.057
He was here?

22:40.059 --> 22:42.626
Where?
In this room.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.628
(sighs)
your bedchambers.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.664
Francis, please
don't do this.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.132
I didn't ask him to come to me.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.533
So that's why you've been
asking questions,

22:49.535 --> 22:50.901
Because he told you to?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.703
Because I wanted
to prove him wrong.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.672
Francis,
for god's sake,

22:54.674 --> 22:56.540
Doesn't it trouble you
that your brother thinks

22:56.542 --> 22:58.042
That you tried
to have him killed?

22:58.044 --> 22:59.577
It troubles me more
that you've been

22:59.579 --> 23:01.679
Wondering if he was right.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.648
I could give you the name of the
ship that bash was to sail on,

23:04.650 --> 23:06.550
Show you the captain.
Does it matter?

23:06.552 --> 23:08.552
I am the crown prince of France.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.921
I can create evidence if I wish.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.825
The more important question is:
Will you take me at my word?

23:14.827 --> 23:16.861
You came to me once,

23:16.863 --> 23:18.929
Accusing my mother of
plotting against you.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.700
You hadn't a shred of proof,
but I believed you.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.469
We are royals.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.705
We have the power
to do terrible things.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.440
Without trust, we're nothing.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.442
This is true
of you and bash as well.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.110
Trust...
How can I trust him?

23:33.112 --> 23:36.113
He killed a man
in the woods for you.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.582
And now these
guards. He...

23:38.584 --> 23:40.851
What, does he say he killed
them in self-defense?

23:40.853 --> 23:42.953
I think it was to
remain close to you.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.488
Francis...

23:44.490 --> 23:46.590
I didn't order
anyone to kill him,

23:46.592 --> 23:49.827
But I can promise you
he's not safe from me.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.029
You can tell him yourself
when he comes here again,

23:52.031 --> 23:54.064
As I'm sure he will.

24:23.228 --> 24:25.629
Catherine: "to ferdinand,
my dearest brother..."

24:25.631 --> 24:28.199
"dearest"?
How many brothers did she have?

24:35.207 --> 24:38.642
"my darling brother ferdinand,

24:38.644 --> 24:42.546
Tonight, I end my life
willingly."

24:42.548 --> 24:45.216
Mention her fondness
for France--

24:45.218 --> 24:47.718
Its culture and beauty.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.588
It's a suicide letter,
not an enticement to pilgrims.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.122
Why did she jump?
We need a reason.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.692
She was lonely.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.694
What does a woman
in her position have

24:56.696 --> 24:59.230
To be lonely about?
That's ridiculous.

24:59.232 --> 25:01.198
You try, then.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.534
(sighs)

25:03.536 --> 25:06.804
The man she loved was...

25:06.806 --> 25:08.606
Someone she could never have.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.941
Poor girl.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.943
Describe him as...

25:12.945 --> 25:15.079
Ruggedly handsome,
with the...

25:15.081 --> 25:17.581
Sexual prowess of a lion.
(chuckles)

25:19.150 --> 25:20.985
Oh, you were serious.

25:22.888 --> 25:25.055
Ever since you kissed my cheek,

25:25.057 --> 25:27.224
I've been wondering
what it would be like

25:27.226 --> 25:29.226
To be kissed on the lips.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.696
Are you sure you're ready?

25:44.309 --> 25:46.577
(muffled grunting)

25:57.789 --> 25:59.790
There.

25:59.792 --> 26:03.227
Now even the dimmest
of servants can find it.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.565
She deserved
a better end.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.968
Don't we all.

26:18.777 --> 26:21.145
(gasps)

26:30.755 --> 26:32.656
You kiss like the french.

26:32.658 --> 26:36.026
Well, we are in France.

26:36.028 --> 26:39.163
I mean, you are positively
fluent in the language of love.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.264
Beginner's luck?

26:43.635 --> 26:47.905
I'm sure your natural abilities
would flourish in bohemia.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.373
(chuckles)

26:50.175 --> 26:52.042
(screams)

26:52.044 --> 26:54.645
Someone fell
from the room above!

26:54.647 --> 26:55.913
Cecilia's in that room!

26:55.915 --> 26:57.181
W-wait!

26:57.183 --> 26:58.682
Uh, you were...

26:58.684 --> 27:00.651
Saying something
about me and bohemia.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.252
Not now!
Wait!

27:07.759 --> 27:09.960
Could she have had
worse timing?

27:09.962 --> 27:12.763
He was just about
to propose to me.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.871
I'm sorry, your grace,
the lady lola's not here.

27:20.873 --> 27:21.972
At this hour?

27:21.974 --> 27:23.240
We're supposed to meet

27:23.242 --> 27:24.875
The king and queen
in the throne room

27:24.877 --> 27:27.645
To pay our respects to
the archduke in his bereavement.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.647
She hurried out early.
She was dressed for riding

27:29.649 --> 27:31.048
And wouldn't say
where she was going.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.784
Oh, no.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.186
Do you know where lola is?

27:53.805 --> 27:56.340
Did you expect
this to be easy?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.742
Think hard before we begin.

27:58.744 --> 28:01.011
I can give you a bit
of leather to bite on

28:01.013 --> 28:03.147
When you need
to scream.

28:09.954 --> 28:12.256
I would never ask this
of you, but I need to get

28:12.258 --> 28:14.224
Through the blood wood to lola
before it's too late.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.260
I can't believe she'd do
something so dangerous.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.995
We all get desperate
at times.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.296
Bash, there's
something else.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.032
When we get to the place,
let me go in alone.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.835
I don't want her to feel
embarrassed or shamed.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.242
Henry:
<i>Follow my lead.</i>

28:32.244 --> 28:33.977
I'll do the talking.
Of course.

28:33.979 --> 28:36.346
You've handled everything
brilliantly so far.

28:38.283 --> 28:41.151
Your majesties, excuse me,

28:41.153 --> 28:42.319
But there's something
you need to know.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.188
One of my patients,

28:44.190 --> 28:46.156
Not fully in control
of their faculties,

28:46.158 --> 28:50.160
Lashed out and... Stabbed father
leduc with his own crucifix.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.229
He's dead.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.865
Catherine:
That's awful.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.233
But not now.

28:58.403 --> 29:02.039
"the looks of a greek god,
the might of a lion"?

29:02.041 --> 29:03.841
She didn't write this.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.343
I know it's hard to see
someone in your family

29:06.345 --> 29:08.445
As capable of
such passion.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.447
What she was incapable of
was writing.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.982
She never learned.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.417
The note
is a forgery.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.987
I fear my dear sister was
the victim of foul play,

29:16.989 --> 29:19.256
Likely by someone
inside the castle.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.792
If that
is the case,

29:21.794 --> 29:23.794
Bohemia will have
no choice but to...

29:23.796 --> 29:26.864
You're right. It's forged.
And I know who was responsible.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.265
The duchess's lover.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.466
(people murmuring)

29:29.468 --> 29:30.934
She had a lover?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.503
Henry: I don't
think we need to

29:32.505 --> 29:35.005
Sully the lady's memory
with tawdry details.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.141
Henry, our dear guest deserves
an honest account

29:37.143 --> 29:39.042
Of what happened.

29:39.044 --> 29:41.779
Last night,
I happened

29:41.781 --> 29:43.413
To walk in on
the duchess

29:43.415 --> 29:46.083
While she was entwined
in the throes of passion

29:46.085 --> 29:49.052
With a man she
barely just met.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.053
My sister?

29:50.055 --> 29:51.989
I was shocked, I assure you,

29:51.991 --> 29:54.124
But I had no intention
of gossiping

29:54.126 --> 29:56.226
About her indiscretion.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.329
As my husband will attest,
I'm not a judgmental person.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.998
Henry?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.866
She's really not.
But...

30:02.868 --> 30:06.003
When news of cecilia's
suicide erupted,

30:06.005 --> 30:08.205
I was immediately
suspicious of this lover,

30:08.207 --> 30:10.107
And I had him
questioned under torture

30:10.109 --> 30:14.912
Until he revealed to me
the actual course of events.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.814
And those were?

30:16.816 --> 30:18.549
Well...

30:18.551 --> 30:21.018
Filled with remorse,

30:21.020 --> 30:26.156
Cecilia-- the chaste,
pious royal that she was--

30:26.158 --> 30:28.492
Threw herself
out of the window,

30:28.494 --> 30:31.261
Afraid of the shame that
this moment of weakness

30:31.263 --> 30:33.163
Would bring to your family.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.365
Oh, my poor dear cecilia.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.335
And her lover, not wanting to
further your family's anguish,

30:38.337 --> 30:41.371
Wrote the note to
protect their secret.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.274
Making it appear that
your sister's pain

30:44.276 --> 30:45.542
Was due to a...

30:45.544 --> 30:48.846
Much more palatable
unrequited love.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.180
Unrequited?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.216
This note mentions
sexual prowess!

30:52.218 --> 30:53.884
I think that was just
wishful thinking

30:53.886 --> 30:56.119
On the part of the
writer. Right, henry?

30:56.121 --> 30:57.354
Hmm.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.022
So, her lover wrote the note

30:59.024 --> 31:01.325
In an effort
to protect her honor?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.962
Ill-advised but gallant.

31:06.164 --> 31:09.233
I want to see this lover.

31:11.102 --> 31:13.437
The heart is a strange beast.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.105
You tortured a man of the cloth?

31:15.107 --> 31:17.307
We didn't know
he was a priest at the time.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.009
He wasn't wearing his collar.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.544
Or much of anything else.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.912
And you killed him?

31:21.914 --> 31:23.580
Unintentionally.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.883
Sometimes...

31:25.885 --> 31:27.985
Our interrogators get
a bit too energetic

31:27.987 --> 31:30.254
When faced with
a reluctant subject.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.922
My sister.

31:33.358 --> 31:35.058
I don't believe it.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.664
I knew that once or twice
she had looked for consolation

31:40.666 --> 31:43.133
In the arms of others, but...

31:43.135 --> 31:44.935
Such a scandal as this.

31:44.937 --> 31:49.006
Can we just say that she drowned
accidentally in the river?

31:49.008 --> 31:50.674
No mention
of suicides

31:50.676 --> 31:53.076
Or old priests for lovers.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.645
I know that
I'm asking you to repeat

31:54.647 --> 31:57.080
A falsehood,
but I would be so grateful.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.449
Well, don't...
Torment yourself, sir.

32:00.952 --> 32:02.686
To maintain
your friendship,

32:02.688 --> 32:05.289
Catherine and I would
go to any lengths.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.159
Yes.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.212
Mary (echoing):
Lola?

32:29.214 --> 32:31.248
(door opens)
lola!

32:33.318 --> 32:35.419
Lola!

32:41.626 --> 32:42.993
Are you all right?
She's fine, my lady.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.062
We've not yet begun.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.663
Please leave us.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.200
Come home with me.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.201
This could kill you.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.202
Mary, please, I can't.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.071
I have to do this.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.605
If you knew the whole story...

32:55.607 --> 32:57.741
It doesn't matter
how it happened.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.544
You're pregnant,
and I understand.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.612
It's not the end
of the world,

33:02.614 --> 33:04.348
Not unless you
make it so.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.983
Let me help you.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.619
Oh, if you... If you only knew.

33:18.629 --> 33:21.631
When francis returned
from paris...

33:21.633 --> 33:23.700
You were at his side.

33:29.707 --> 33:31.541
Is that my husband's child?

33:33.745 --> 33:35.345
Yes.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.314
(sobbing)

33:45.356 --> 33:47.157
Will she be all right?

33:47.159 --> 33:50.027
I don't know what's
going to happen to her.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.562
I don't know what's
going to h-happen.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.564
I didn't put in that...

33:54.566 --> 33:56.566
That light in the
window because of lola.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.435
I talked to francis.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.470
And he managed to
convince you he was innocent

34:00.472 --> 34:02.539
Of any attempt on my life.
I believe him.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.640
Of course you do.
Bash,

34:03.642 --> 34:05.409
Stop this.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.544
Look at you two, at
each other's throats.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.780
Well, my part in this
has ended. I am married.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.515
You want me to leave.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.417
There is nothing for you here.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.584
You're here!

34:14.586 --> 34:16.820
You need protection from them.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.422
You must trust me
on this.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.824
They will always put
their interests above yours.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.393
You offer me so much
that I cannot accept,

34:23.395 --> 34:25.829
Because I am wed.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.431
You cannot care for me.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.434
In any way.
Do you understand?

34:30.436 --> 34:32.836
If you must hate someone...

34:32.838 --> 34:34.538
Please, hate me.

34:36.707 --> 34:39.076
If I were capable
of that, I would.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.581
(sighs)

34:44.583 --> 34:45.849
I'd forgotten
what it was like

34:45.851 --> 34:48.452
Working with you
instead of against you.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.553
(sighs)

34:49.555 --> 34:50.854
You're very charming,

34:50.856 --> 34:52.456
When you're not
trying to kill me.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.424
I mean it.
There is no one like you.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.727
You're a galleon in full sail,
all guns blazing.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.196
High on the waves.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.098
I remember.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.233
It's still true.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.835
You make other women tame.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.369
(chuckles softly)

35:06.371 --> 35:08.438
Stay with me.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.743
Henry.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.312
Don't ruin it.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.733
I'm sorry.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.402
That you slept with my husband
or that you're pregnant?

35:39.404 --> 35:41.872
Mary, you were
engaged to bash.

35:41.874 --> 35:43.707
Francis thought he'd
never see you again.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.509
I-I thought you'd
never see him again.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.144
But I would see you!

35:47.146 --> 35:50.180
You were my friend,

35:50.182 --> 35:53.383
Not to mention my lady, and
you knew that I loved him still.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.485
I'm sorry.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.420
I'm so sorry.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.593
Does francis know
that you're pregnant?

36:03.595 --> 36:05.328
No. And he can't.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.665
Well, he'll know soon enough.
You'll start to show.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.267
Not for some weeks.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.868
Months. A-and by then...

36:11.870 --> 36:13.904
What?
I don't know.

36:13.906 --> 36:18.542
But all I ask is that you give
me time to sort my options out.

36:18.544 --> 36:22.212
If you tell francis I
am carrying his child,

36:22.214 --> 36:24.347
I essentially become his.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.550
I become nothing more than

36:26.552 --> 36:29.252
The woman bearing
a royal's child or...

36:29.254 --> 36:30.487
Or his mistress.

36:30.489 --> 36:31.821
And that's not
an option.

36:31.823 --> 36:35.492
For any of us,
I assure you.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.294
This will forever
change my life,

36:37.296 --> 36:39.296
But it doesn't
have to change yours,

36:39.298 --> 36:41.965
If you keep it a secret.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.834
From my husband?

36:44.836 --> 36:47.938
That's what
you're asking me?

36:47.940 --> 36:51.308
Yes, that's what
I'm asking.

37:03.654 --> 37:04.921
Bash.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.323
I caught the boar.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.924
He fell in our pit.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.393
You should've seen the
look on carrick's face.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.628
(chuckles)
congratulations.

37:11.630 --> 37:12.929
Come and join
us for dinner.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.831
Actually, I'm... I'm leaving.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.600
Leaving us?

37:16.602 --> 37:18.435
Leaving France.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.503
I came to say good-bye.

37:20.505 --> 37:21.905
Good-bye?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.506
That's not why you came.

37:23.508 --> 37:26.910
Stay for supper.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.378
And the night.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.713
And me.

37:31.315 --> 37:33.250
And leave tomorrow.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.658
A mark of flowers, hmm?

37:41.660 --> 37:44.561
I used to pick roses
every morning.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.997
They cut me to pieces,
but I didn't care.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.867
That's because
they're beautiful.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.602
Just like you.

38:00.678 --> 38:02.946
(grunting)

38:02.948 --> 38:04.648
Kenna:
So the archduke

38:04.650 --> 38:07.717
Left without so much
as a good-bye.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.053
His sister just died.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.855
The man is overcome with grief.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.557
She could have thrown herself
off of any precipice in europe.

38:14.559 --> 38:15.992
Why here?

38:18.562 --> 38:21.665
Well, clearly
the archduke is a fool.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.635
There'll be other suitors.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.704
I promise.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.005
But...

38:29.007 --> 38:30.840
His departure means

38:30.842 --> 38:32.709
You'll be staying
in court longer.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.581
And that means

38:38.583 --> 38:40.583
We get to play.
(giggles)

38:40.585 --> 38:41.985

38:49.760 --> 38:51.828
