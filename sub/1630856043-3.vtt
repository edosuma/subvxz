00:04.003 --> 00:07.507
Girl. You did not come

00:07.590 --> 00:10.677
Ca$h gon' recognize that
cheap-ass Singapore polyester

00:10.760 --> 00:12.262
before you even walk through the door.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.347
-I got this, okay?
-Do you though?

00:14.431 --> 00:16.056
'Cause you said you ain't getting paid

00:16.140 --> 00:18.435

00:18.518 --> 00:19.728

00:33.992 --> 00:36.077
Ooh, when the last time

00:36.161 --> 00:37.245

00:48.381 --> 00:51.009
Pay attention right now
'cause the spirit done hit me.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.011
It's about to get real acrobatic.

00:53.094 --> 00:56.222
It's the "Oh, Daddy,
I need my rent paid, Daddy."

00:56.306 --> 00:57.390
Ease it on back with that now.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.850
-Ah.
-Oh, yeah.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.226
-Pay attention now.

-Okay, yeah.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.687
-Then you choke!
-Bitch.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.397
And then you like spin around,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.191

01:06.274 --> 01:07.484
That's Trina 3:16.

Get your ass off of me.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.988
Okay, Mia, keep it cute, okay?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.281
'Cause this bitch is at a 12.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.657
Alright, now see, for me,

01:14.741 --> 01:17.118
performing at a smooth six always works.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.370
But that's just me.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.997
You need to focus on changing
out of that Adidas hoodie.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.248
That not cute.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.708

Deja not answering the phone?

02:33.361 --> 02:37.073
Ooh. We at SLS, Duke!

02:37.156 --> 02:38.616
Uncle Calvin told me y'all left?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.871

02:45.623 --> 02:48.501
'Cause y'all think y'all can do
whatever the fuck y'all wanna do!

02:48.585 --> 02:49.918
You don't understand.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.296
The shit was hard for a minute, Duke.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.256
A minute, Jazmin? A minute?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.383
Bitch, it's been three days.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.303
Why y'all think y'all can play in my face?

02:58.386 --> 03:00.472
Your uncle had us in Doral.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.265

And you know I cannot stand Deja,

03:04.225 --> 03:06.102

03:06.186 --> 03:08.730
Athletes, rappers,

03:08.813 --> 03:11.399
And look at this wig that she got me.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.442
It's an invisible lace.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.485
What's it giving? What's it giving?

03:13.568 --> 03:14.736
Scalp!

03:18.490 --> 03:21.034
-Ooh, mommy! Ooh!

03:21.117 --> 03:24.329
Yeah, you look like my money,

03:24.412 --> 03:25.914
Tell Deja to call me back.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.959
Fuck. Fuck.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.390
Baby won't you tell me what
you really think...

03:43.473 --> 03:45.433
Wow. Look good.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.726

Oh, you play the piano?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.825

04:47.037 --> 04:49.080
Do you wanna be a good friend of me?

04:49.164 --> 04:51.416
Why won't you pour up that Hennessy?

04:51.499 --> 04:52.584
Come here.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.169
I know it's been too long

04:55.462 --> 04:57.172
I've been on the road too much

04:57.255 --> 04:59.382
Had to get back to ya

04:59.466 --> 05:01.343

05:49.307 --> 05:51.433
I've been on the road too much

06:08.326 --> 06:09.411

You wanna come?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.166
Grab me a pack of Newports.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.053
Okay.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.597
I'm ready when you are.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.183
Yo, you good?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.978
-After, you know, what happened?
-Yeah.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.647
You know them AK niggas
ain't got but one brain cell.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.190
-Trip off that shit.
-Yeah.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.817
Hang out with you, they gon' have two.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.697
Ooh, this AC is bussin', man.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.449
That air on the bus is ass.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.825
I almost got musty.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.284
Why you got a hoodie on?

06:50.368 --> 06:52.954
It gets hotter than five fat niggas
in a hot tub.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.205
I'm on my period.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.582
Me too.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.375
Really?

06:58.168 --> 06:59.169
Yeah.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.088
Right, yeah. I'm sorry.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.174
Why you sorry?

07:05.383 --> 07:06.384
I don't know.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.866
Okay. So the people want
to know what inspired

07:29.949 --> 07:31.201
the whole trap kitchen thing?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.078
'Cause, girl,

07:33.161 --> 07:34.871
I don't know what other people felt

07:34.954 --> 07:37.332
but when I saw it, girl...

07:37.415 --> 07:40.043
But I feel so grateful, because, like,

07:40.126 --> 07:43.546
not a lot of people in the world like me

07:43.630 --> 07:47.717
get to be in a trap house, so.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.386
So, crack is fun?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.472
Crack is not fun, no.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.016
It must be fun.
That's why people go back, right?

07:56.558 --> 07:58.061
I don't know. Do you wanna tell 'em?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.813
Yeah, you know,

07:59.896 --> 08:03.525
this really just kind of came
from a personal place.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.235
Reina has, like--

08:05.318 --> 08:06.903
-My uncle was a crackhead.
-Yep.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.322
-Yeah.
-I'm so sorry.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.994
It's a serious topic, and I wasn't sure
if I wanted to mention this today.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.373
It's sensitive for me
to talk about, but...

08:19.332 --> 08:20.250
Hey, you ready?

08:20.332 --> 08:21.376
You not getting nothin'?

08:21.459 --> 08:22.752
No, no, no. They don't--

08:22.836 --> 08:25.714
Nah, they didn't have anything
for me here, in this store.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.592
-Francois, he's gonna meet us in Oakland?
-Yep.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.386
He's out there doing press
like he said he was.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.681
Okay. That's cool.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.474
That's really good.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.061
Can I get a pack of Newports

08:40.145 --> 08:41.895
and some Black and Milds?

08:41.980 --> 08:42.981
Sure.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.525
Ow!

08:47.152 --> 08:49.029
Can you get the cherry flavor?

08:49.112 --> 08:51.156
I'm just playin'. I'm grown, man.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.410
Yep. Oh, my God.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.287
-There you go.
-Thank you. Here you go.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.330
-Alright. Have a good day. Yeah.
-Keep the change.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.540
-Appreciate you.
-Thank you.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.708
Yeah.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.757
Oh, shit!

09:11.259 --> 09:14.512
My bad, man. I had tried these on earlier.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.014
They ain't fit my face.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.098
That's not a problem.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.725
-Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.772
Bad news. Engine's overheated.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.565
God must want us to sit still.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.609
Amen.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.778
But shit, how long God talking about?

09:29.861 --> 09:31.988
I don't know how long
it's gon' take to fix.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.656
Tow truck driver's on his way.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.699
Damn.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.242
-Come on, let's go!
-Here.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.096
Oh, shit. She wakes.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.014
I was wondering how long
you was gonna stay asleep.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.474
Knocked that ass out, huh?

10:01.184 --> 10:03.937
Nah, I was jetlagged. You didn't do shit.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.730
Oh, really? Don't play me.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.233
-I ain't playing. You didn't do shit.
-Don't play me.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.694
Look, look, I gotta go to the studio
and lay some shit.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.196
-Okay.
-But I heated up the pool for you.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.948
I got some food coming later.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.950
And got my masseuse coming at 3:00.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.952
It's like that.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.996
You ain't got to worry about me, okay?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.582
I got some stuff to do
while I'm here anyways.

10:24.666 --> 10:25.750
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.252
What you got planned?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.503
Um...

10:29.963 --> 10:31.131
just a couple meetings.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.111
I didn't say shit.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.280
If anything, you need to be worried
about your dime.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.949
Oh, my God, bruh!

-Oh, man. Okay, bruh. Okay.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.052
Now you got charges 'cause you're trying

11:59.135 --> 12:00.470

12:18.863 --> 12:21.157

-Go where?
-Lyft trippin'.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.466
-So shoot.
-Only a 35-minute--

12:38.550 --> 12:41.511
No, no, no, no, no, no.
My cramps are really bad.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.679

12:42.762 --> 12:44.389
Man! Let's go and get our steps in.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.016

You be up there sounding winded.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.561

12:59.029 --> 13:00.488

13:02.866 --> 13:03.867

Chastity!

13:10.331 --> 13:11.499
Wait, please.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.838
Everything is going according to plan.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.173
Uh-uh, move your head to the side.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.924

13:20.008 --> 13:21.801

13:33.355 --> 13:35.565
Hey, baby, I don't have time.
Let's get to it.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.359
How was the first dose of the dick?

13:37.442 --> 13:38.985
It was good.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.863
Mm, but it was kind of weird, too,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.301
Leesi, come on now.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.053
We both know that Mia got trust issues.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.930
She don't ever like a nigga

14:17.357 --> 14:19.234
This is a fine-ass, rich-ass nigga.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.485
What's not to like?

14:20.568 --> 14:22.278
Shit, 'cause I'm saying

14:23.697 --> 14:26.491
'cause we can't let no good nigga
go to waste.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.247
Damn! I'm just kidding.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.832
-Yeah, bitch.
-Yeah, 'cause that's about

14:33.915 --> 14:35.083

14:55.061 --> 14:56.813

14:58.398 --> 15:00.108
Are you sure we're going the right way?

15:00.191 --> 15:01.484
You wanna look at the GPS?

15:01.568 --> 15:02.986
No, I don't.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.529
It's probably just trees and trailers

15:04.612 --> 15:06.698
and other funky shit
I don't give a fuck about.

15:06.781 --> 15:07.991
Isn't it beautiful, though?

15:08.491 --> 15:11.202
When was the last time you seen
real-life "foilage"?

15:11.286 --> 15:14.122
-It's foliage.
-You know what I meant.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.334
We should have waited
for the Lyft like I had said.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.754
Shawna! Do you wanna go back to Circle K
and look at the footage of you stealing?

15:25.300 --> 15:26.885
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.011

16:58.309 --> 16:59.728
No, you can't do that.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.230
She ain't got no uncles,
big cousins, second cousins?

17:02.313 --> 17:03.606
-Somebody?
-Hey, chill that shit out.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.816
It's just a play date.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.943
Man, just hand my child the phone, please.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.319
-This a pay phone, not a play phone.
-Come here, baby.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.696
-Thank you.
-Talk to your mama.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.503
You give one, you give them all.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.900
Damn, man.
Someone gonna go to jail for this shit.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.860
-Jail?
-Yeah.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.237
You about to hit that nigga?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.905
I don't know
what's up with the jit, man?

18:34.364 --> 18:35.490
I can't trust him.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.991
Damn.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.286
But no shit come before the fam.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.040
The longer you drag that shit out...

18:53.008 --> 18:55.301
God. This is not supposed to be my life.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.012
Man, why is this shit happening?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.640
I know better than to follow you anyway.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.434
Girl, what's your fuckin' problem?

19:02.517 --> 19:03.727
You taking last night out on me?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.103
'Cause that was not my fault.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.731
Yeah. You and your
misogynistic-ass sympathy

19:07.814 --> 19:09.482
really tried to make it my fault.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.901
Meanwhile, you don't be taking
the blame for shit.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.778
I know you're not fuckin' talking.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.573
Chastity, why don't you just admit
that you don't know what you're doing?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.616
Look around.
We are literally nowhere.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.118
You have no business managing anybody.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.953
You can barely manage them little braids.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.455
Fuck!

19:24.080 --> 19:25.415
Shit.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.875
What you doin'?

19:27.542 --> 19:30.587
My shoes are hurting my...

19:31.046 --> 19:33.840
Hold up. You talking all this shit
and you ain't even wearing no socks?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.842
Don't worry about what I got on
and don't got on.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.302
Fuck. Shit hurt.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.595
And you ashy?

19:38.678 --> 19:39.763
God!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.766
This is not my dream. None of this.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.351
This is not supposed
to be this fucking hard.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.269
-It's gotta be a sign. Yes!
-Oh, my God.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.979
This ain't my fucking dream either.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.564
Damn!

19:50.273 --> 19:51.399
Man, I've been trying my best!

19:51.483 --> 19:53.193
From day one, I came correct.

19:53.276 --> 19:56.571
And every time I get a win for y'all,
y'all still treat me like a loser.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.032
And I know you don't want me here.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.951
And for real, I don't even know if I want
to be here my damn self.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.079
Shit, it ain't like
I'm gettin' paid for this.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.623
I'm not getting paid for this either.
I'm broke.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.792
You don't know broke how I know broke.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.169
Let me show you my bank account
'cause I have $12 in that bitch right now.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.213
$12? Shit, I can make
something happen with $12.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.798
What are you making happen with 12 bucks?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.091
-I'll flip it.
-What?

20:17.133 --> 20:18.093
This is private property!

20:23.973 --> 20:25.642
What's private?

20:25.725 --> 20:26.810
I'm warning you.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.771
-Move!
-The gravel? This gravel?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.940
-Go!
-We're on the side of the road.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.192
Shawna, shut the fuck up.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.194
No. Fuck it. What?

20:36.277 --> 20:38.113
This whole day is fucked.
This tour is fucked.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.656
This would be fucking happening right now.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.324
-Go ahead. Go ahead.
-Shawna!

20:41.408 --> 20:43.827
I will be a martyr in this bitch.
I knew it.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.704
-Shut up!
-No. Shoot me!

20:45.787 --> 20:47.038
-Shut your mouth!
-You want to do it?

20:47.122 --> 20:48.998
Look at you! Shoot me!
Go ahead, John Wick!

20:49.082 --> 20:51.960
Yeah! Shoot her. Shoot us.
Shoot the both of us!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.887
I just want you all to leave!

21:02.971 --> 21:05.181
Please go!

21:06.224 --> 21:08.059
She got the gun and she cryin'.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.103
Why are you doing this to me?

21:10.186 --> 21:11.604
-Oh, my God, here she fucking goes.
-Please.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.856
-Okay.
-Why she crying?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.065
Leave me alone!

21:14.149 --> 21:16.067
Oh, she running back in the house?

21:16.151 --> 21:18.361
She probably got about 17 cats in there.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.238
Elmer Fudd-ass bitch.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.116
What the fuck? Yo! Yo.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.452
-Oh, shit.
-Nigga.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.995
Yo, I thought we was about to die.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.872
It was over.
I thought we was gonna be on a t-shirt.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.207
-Shit.
-Oh, my God.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.459
Hashtag The Duke.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.294
-No. Stop.
-I was grabbing--

21:34.377 --> 21:35.587
Look, she's still watching. Look.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.427
All my ladies turn to snacks

21:42.510 --> 21:44.763
SUVs black on black on

21:44.846 --> 21:46.264
SUVs black on black

21:46.348 --> 21:48.224
I was fuckin' up,
but now I'm back on track

21:48.308 --> 21:49.726
That's a fact, woo

21:51.061 --> 21:52.520
Hey, what's up, my boy?

21:52.604 --> 21:53.605
6lack. How you feeling?

21:53.688 --> 21:54.731
Good.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.274
Good to see you again.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.361
You wild.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.737
Hey, we gon' catch up with you.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.739
Please get a drink, baby.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.577
-Good to see me again, huh?
-Oh, my God.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.204
Yeah, he thought you was my ex.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.122
Oh, so you got a type?

22:11.206 --> 22:12.749
Ah...

22:12.832 --> 22:14.167
What are we drinking?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.960
Martell. Anyway.

22:16.586 --> 22:17.587
So what happened to her?

22:17.671 --> 22:18.838
We broke up.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.591
Okay. Why?

22:21.675 --> 22:24.386
She moved in with me
and, like, in a week into it,

22:24.469 --> 22:26.846
I was just like, "Nah, this ain't it."

22:26.930 --> 22:29.432
So I packed up her shit,
and I moved her out.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.642
Oh, wow.

22:30.725 --> 22:31.976
Yeah, I had to protect my peace, for real.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.228
Mm-hmm.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.022
I would never do no shit like that to you.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.983
And you know that.
She couldn't even stand next to you.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.611
-You know why?
-Why?

22:42.070 --> 22:44.531
She was using me,
and you got your own shit.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.491
It's just different.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.411
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.162
Yeah. I'm with you when you right.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.711
Why would you even put a house over there?

22:57.794 --> 23:00.380
It's not shit over there.
What are they doing?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.716
Man, they probably out here
making some cider.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.050
Yeah, nigga cider.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.218
What, bruh?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.766
Man, it is beautiful out here, though.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.143
Like, low-key,

23:13.226 --> 23:15.353
when I get a place,
that's where I'm gonna put it.

23:15.437 --> 23:18.815
Far away from everybody.
Make niggas come to me.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.276
That is not gonna last long at all.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.527
Not the way you like to talk.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.654
And I can hook it up how I want to?

23:24.738 --> 23:28.742
Girl, I'ma get a fish tank,
a couple horses,

23:28.825 --> 23:31.202
-some motherfuckin' goats.
-Okay.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.495
I'ma even get an alpaca.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.248
And I'll be good.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.626
I ain't got to talk to niggas
for a whole year.

23:38.710 --> 23:42.547
It'd be nice to just sit for a little bit.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.924
I don't know, man. It's like I feel like

23:45.008 --> 23:47.886
I've been running around
nonstop since I was a kid.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.512
Damn.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.349
What made you even come out to Miami
in the first place?

23:53.308 --> 23:55.852
Man, my uncle took me in
after my mom died.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.520
Oh, shit.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.898
When did she pass away?

24:02.192 --> 24:03.151
I was 11.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.652
What?

24:05.195 --> 24:06.404
You were a baby.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.740
I'm so sorry.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.410
-That's awful.
-Man, I'm good.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.080
I mean, shit, what else was I gonna do?

24:17.082 --> 24:19.459
I had to do all kinds of shit to survive.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.128
I can't even step foot in Hialeah no more.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.588
Damn.

24:24.339 --> 24:28.802
Then my uncle put me
in the "family business."

24:29.928 --> 24:32.806
And I was just thinkin' like, man,
it gotta be more to life

24:32.889 --> 24:36.518
than wrangling hoes
and getting niggas dicks sucked.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.231
Nigga.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.608
But hold up.
What's up with you, though?

24:43.692 --> 24:45.443
You a scammer?

24:45.527 --> 24:46.528
No!

24:47.070 --> 24:49.239
-Lie again.
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.200
When I was at the hotel,

24:52.283 --> 24:55.412
I was taking photos
of people's credit cards

24:55.495 --> 24:57.122
and sending them to my coworker.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.998
Oh, you wild.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.875
But he was already skimming, you know?

25:00.959 --> 25:03.920
And I just really, really needed bread
'cause my parents

25:04.671 --> 25:05.922
my parents cut me off.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.383
Technically, it was reparations.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.552
Technically.

25:10.635 --> 25:11.886
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

25:12.595 --> 25:16.725
Hold up. So the whole time
you was judging me,

25:16.808 --> 25:19.060
your ass was in the lobby
making plays, too.

25:19.728 --> 25:22.313
Okay. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah.

25:22.981 --> 25:27.110
But now I'm catching cases.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.867
My coworker,
he just got charged and

25:34.951 --> 25:36.578
I don't know, man, if he goes to prison,

25:36.661 --> 25:39.873
I have literally no idea
what's about to happen to me.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.417
Oh, alright.
So shit, we down bad right now.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.210
-Yeah.
-We ain't going out like that.

25:44.753 --> 25:46.963
Nah, you just gotta get ahead of it

25:47.047 --> 25:48.923
'cause this the part where niggas
start snitching.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.634
Really? What do you mean?

25:51.718 --> 25:54.804
I mean... you trust this nigga?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.808
I mean, yeah, I thought so, but.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.270
I don't know. He hasn't been responding
to any of my shit.

26:04.314 --> 26:07.609
Alright, you just gotta keep him close.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.070
You got anything on him?

26:10.153 --> 26:14.032
Yeah. He and his cousin be scamming,

26:14.115 --> 26:17.118
like, outside of the hotel,
boosting hella shit.

26:17.202 --> 26:18.495
Oh, you good. And what else?

26:18.578 --> 26:23.083
I mean,
he doesn't eat a lot of meat.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.210
Nigga, I don't give
a fuck what this nigga eat!

26:27.003 --> 26:28.380
Shout out to the GOAT.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.090
We got Ca$h Chaser in the building.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.508
Let's go.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.718

26:33.802 --> 26:37.138
-Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!

26:37.222 --> 26:38.473

26:38.556 --> 26:42.102
Okay. It's the GOAT, nigga.

26:42.185 --> 26:43.311
Hey.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.271
You're doing your thing, man.
Keep doing it.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.273
I appreciate it, legend.
Hey, this my girl, Mia.

26:47.899 --> 26:48.775

26:48.858 --> 26:50.318
Nice to meet you.

26:50.402 --> 26:52.612
Oh, my God, thanks.

26:52.696 --> 26:54.114
I'll catch y'all.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.574
-Ay. What's up?
-You know that girl?

26:56.658 --> 26:58.868
Now you know her too. So.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.002
Fuckin' finally. Thank God.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.007
I'm so fuckin' tired.

27:18.596 --> 27:19.639
Oh, my God.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.684
Maurice is facing federal charges.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.103
Like, the FBI, the actual Feds.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.355
What the fuck? What the fuck?

27:27.439 --> 27:28.773
Look, just stay calm.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.233
Remember what I told you?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.528
As long as you stay a step
or two ahead of everything,

27:33.611 --> 27:34.654
you gon' be alright.

27:37.782 --> 27:38.700
Okay. I'm gonna call him.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.035
Yeah, call him.
And look...

27:40.952 --> 27:42.328

27:57.552 --> 28:00.889

you're ready for me

28:02.390 --> 28:04.309
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

28:04.392 --> 28:05.435
Sorry.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.774

28:10.857 --> 28:12.400
'Cause I'm out of reach

28:14.694 --> 28:16.488
I don't need somebody

28:17.572 --> 28:18.782

28:18.865 --> 28:20.575
