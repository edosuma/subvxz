WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:04.526
I didn't know that
the bill was past due.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.876
Yes, fine, I'll look
into it. Thank you.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.660
Hey, here's an extra
bag of socks.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.401
Dad, why do I need
all of these?

00:10.445 --> 00:13.404
'Cause if you don't want to do
laundry more than once a week,

00:13.448 --> 00:14.971
you need extra socks.

00:15.015 --> 00:19.497
I also, uh, put
something else in there.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.846
It's college,
you're not a kid anymore,

00:20.890 --> 00:22.065
there's gonna be
girls around and...

00:22.109 --> 00:24.502
Condoms

00:24.546 --> 00:26.069
You don't have to
take it out, okay?

00:26.113 --> 00:27.288
Just put them away.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.376
For your own protection,
all right?

00:32.423 --> 00:35.165
Yes, what bill didn't I pay now?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.427
Oh, hey, Baez. Yep.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.473
Oh, Sean, catch.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.650
What's this?

00:41.693 --> 00:43.086
Your signed Rangers hockey puck.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.218
No, this is yours.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.828
Well, every time
I go looking for it,

00:45.871 --> 00:48.265
it seems to be in your room,
so I figured, it's all yours.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.354
Sweet.
I'm gonna give you
the best gift in the world,

00:50.398 --> 00:51.660
and all you're gonna give me
is a "sweet."

00:51.703 --> 00:52.835
Just don't expect this back
when you end up

00:52.878 --> 00:54.054
flunking out
and have to come home.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.925
I'm not flunking
out of anything.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.796
Sure.Hey, you two knock it off,
all right?

00:57.840 --> 01:00.234
You, pack up.
You, off to school.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.366
Yeah, okay.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.196
Come on, Larry. I got to see
my oldest off to college.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.504
Just cover me for this game,
would you? Thank you.

01:09.547 --> 01:13.334
Thanks.Someone seems frazzled.

01:13.377 --> 01:16.511
Says the person not juggling
93 things at the present moment.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.121
Do you want to talk about it?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.905
I probably do, but not now.
Let's talk about this.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.124
What do we got?

01:21.168 --> 01:23.474
Dr. Max McCandless, age 51.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.346
He has a practice upstairs
on the fourth floor.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.174
He was coming out of the parking
garage, when out of nowhere,

01:27.217 --> 01:30.916
a guy in a hoodie pumps a dozen
shots through his windshield.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.745
Let me guess, the good doc won't
be healing thyself this time.

01:33.789 --> 01:37.358
No need, all shots missed except
the one that grazed his wrist.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.406
World's worst shooter?

01:42.450 --> 01:45.583
Or the world's luckiest doc.

01:48.412 --> 01:51.589
Have you seen Anthony?
He's not in his office.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.417
No, you want me to try his cell?

01:53.461 --> 01:54.592
No, he's not answering
that, either.

01:54.636 --> 01:55.419
Oh, here he comes.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.421
Anthony.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.422
Sorry I'm late.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.510
You okay?

01:59.554 --> 02:00.772
Yeah, my alarm didn't go off,

02:00.816 --> 02:03.514
and then I got stuck
in traffic is all.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.429
What's the haps for today?

02:05.473 --> 02:06.561
:
Let's see.

02:06.604 --> 02:09.607
A Flatiron robbery--
that's for you--

02:09.651 --> 02:12.393
prepping victim for trial--
that's for me.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.786
Destruction of Mackenzie
evidence-- that's for you--

02:14.830 --> 02:16.397
and I'm seeing Judge Walsh
at 2:00,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.138
so I'm gonna need
that by 1:30.

02:18.181 --> 02:21.141
Seriously?
That's barely enough time to...

02:21.184 --> 02:23.143
Where's your watch?
You always wear your watch.

02:23.186 --> 02:26.537
Must've forgot it at home.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.931
Is everything okay?

02:28.974 --> 02:30.411
Can't a guy have an off morning?

02:30.454 --> 02:32.195
Does it need a big explanation?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.718
All right, fine, fine.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.242
Ms. Reagan, I just got a call
from accounting.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.939
Apparently, there were
charges this morning,

02:36.982 --> 02:38.810
over $8,000

02:38.854 --> 02:41.596
on the department card issued
to Detective Abetemarco.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.773
Okay, we got it, Cameron.
Thanks for your help.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.826
I had a date last night.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.480
I met her on Entranced.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.178
Ooh, the hookup app?

02:58.221 --> 03:01.181
That's not what this was.
I mean, we had a great time.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.834
But I woke up this morning,

03:02.878 --> 03:06.621
she was gone,
as was my wallet and my Rolex.

03:06.664 --> 03:07.839
You're kidding me.I called her,

03:07.883 --> 03:10.320
I texted,
I even went down to the gallery

03:10.364 --> 03:12.496
in SoHo she manages,
but they never heard of her.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.456
Job was as fake
as her number and her name.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.806
Which was?Donna.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.199
Let me see
her Entranced profile.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.069
Why?

03:20.112 --> 03:22.071
Why not?We got work to do.

03:22.114 --> 03:25.553
Anthony, she committed a crime
against you and this office.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.207
Don't you want to find her?

03:27.250 --> 03:30.122
No, I just want to do my job
and you should do yours,

03:30.166 --> 03:32.386
and we ain't never
talking about this again.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.648
Listen to me.I'll have your answers

03:33.691 --> 03:37.217
on the Mackenzie evidence
by 1:30.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.482
Okay, thank you.
Anyone able to ID the shooter?

03:41.525 --> 03:43.484
All were too shook up
to remember anything.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.486
Security camera up there
is on the blink.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.140
Super said it's been
on backorder for a month.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.664
Well, hopefully your partner's
getting something useful

03:49.707 --> 03:51.579
from the victim.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.842
I wish I could be
more helpful, Detective.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.105
I-I just can't think of anyone
I'd consider an enemy.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.150
That's funny, 'cause I could
think of about ten enemies

03:58.194 --> 03:59.630
of mine right off
the top of my head.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.676
You're the police.
I'm a fertility doctor.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.721
Fair enough.You're the Baby Magician.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.593
I-I've seen you
on the morning talk shows.

04:05.636 --> 04:08.639
Yeah, your partner was asking me
about my enemies and, uh,

04:08.683 --> 04:10.119
the truth is, couples come to me
desperate to conceive,

04:10.162 --> 04:11.512
I help them.

04:11.555 --> 04:14.515
I don't make enemies,
I make dreams come true.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.559
Ah.What about the couples

04:15.603 --> 04:16.821
beyond help?

04:16.865 --> 04:17.909
They must be devastated

04:17.953 --> 04:19.476
when you have to tell them no.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.522
Yeah, thankfully those are
few and far between, and, uh,

04:21.565 --> 04:23.132
even they get a referral,

04:23.175 --> 04:25.743
and they start wonderful
families via adoption.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.093
How 'bout you, Doc?
You, uh, have a family?

04:28.137 --> 04:30.661
Ex-wife and a son.
Uh, Joan and-and Max Jr.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.055
Both of whom
I'm still very close to.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.230
Good.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.711
Listen...

04:36.754 --> 04:37.929
...you know,
if there's nothing else,

04:37.973 --> 04:39.540
I'd-I'd really like
to get going.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.759
I was headed to my picnic
when all this began.

04:41.803 --> 04:42.934
Yourpicnic?Yeah.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.327
I mean, it's-it's
given by the people

04:44.371 --> 04:46.547
that I help every year
on the High Line.

04:46.590 --> 04:49.158
They bring their kids,
we celebrate.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.551
What can I say? I'm blessed.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.769
Well, blessed or not, Doc,

04:51.813 --> 04:53.380
somebody's gunning
for you right now.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.338
You sure you don't want to take
a rain check on the picnic?

04:55.382 --> 04:57.775
It's already underway and
I-I hate to disappoint people.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.082
All right, tell you what, we'll
make sure you get safe passage.

05:00.125 --> 05:03.868
Uh, uh, Cosgrove, can you
give the good doc a lift?

05:03.912 --> 05:05.348
I don't know.
Let me ask my boss.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.828
Your boss owes me one.
She'll be fine with it.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.221
Trust me. Go ahead. She'll
take care of you. Thank you.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.745
Right this way.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.227
Start with the ex-wife.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.638
THERAPIST:
You're doing just great.

05:34.682 --> 05:37.032
JOHN:
Eh.

05:37.075 --> 05:40.427
For a guy who took
two bullets in the spine.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.651
My boss is here.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.871
Take five?

06:03.798 --> 06:07.410
Commissioner.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.804
What's this, a surprise?

06:09.847 --> 06:12.241
I hate to interrupt.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.156
Oh, no worries.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.636
She's a stone sadist.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.420
I appreciate the break.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.553
Got everything you need?

06:19.596 --> 06:22.947
Other than full use
of my legs, I'm all good.

06:24.949 --> 06:27.648
Department's gonna take care
of it all.

06:27.691 --> 06:28.649
Medical costs,

06:28.692 --> 06:31.042
transpo, home care.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.348
Till I get back on my feet?

06:32.392 --> 06:35.046
Till you tell us
to go the hell away.

06:35.090 --> 06:38.093
Just want to get back
on the job.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.012
Why are you here, Frank?

06:44.055 --> 06:46.536
John, you're not
gonna be cleared

06:46.580 --> 06:49.365
to return to active duty.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.325
So this is how it works.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.807
The department surgeon,
the nature of your injuries,

06:56.851 --> 07:00.420
they said no way.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.901
You can keep an
administrative post.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.903
Or you...

07:05.947 --> 07:07.949
can cash out and
collect your pension.

07:10.473 --> 07:14.259
That's another shot
in the back is what it is.

07:14.303 --> 07:18.960
This one's out
of my hands, John.

07:19.743 --> 07:23.181
I know, Frank.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.709
You said anything I need?

07:29.753 --> 07:31.842
Name it.

07:31.886 --> 07:35.280
My son Jay is in the 3-7.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.760
Good cop, what I hear.

07:36.804 --> 07:39.589
Not surprised, being who.

07:39.633 --> 07:43.419
You find the son of a bitch
in the 3-7

07:43.463 --> 07:48.032
who refused my boy a post
at the hospital when I was in.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.906
What the hell
are you talking about?

07:51.949 --> 07:55.823
You're telling me your son
was refused this post?

07:55.866 --> 07:57.651
You find him, Frank,

07:57.694 --> 08:01.481
and fire his ass.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.316
♪

08:37.081 --> 08:38.692
Janko.Officer Janko,

08:38.735 --> 08:41.172
this is Officer Irving,
3rd Precinct.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.174
Yeah?Ten minutes ago, I detained

08:43.218 --> 08:45.002
several juveniles at Adams Park.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.918
One of 'em said
his name is Sean.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.094
Handed me a courtesy card
claiming you're family.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.401
Is he okay?Other than getting popped

08:52.444 --> 08:54.403
for cutting class
and underage drinking.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.057
You want to come talk about it?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.102
Just you, not Uncle Jamie!

08:58.146 --> 09:00.017
I'm on my way.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.849
You can say no again,

09:05.893 --> 09:07.329
but they're not gonna take no.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.461
There's a lot of baseball
left in this season,

09:09.505 --> 09:11.638
and they'll just come back
with another game

09:11.681 --> 09:13.074
for you to throw out
the first pitch.

09:13.117 --> 09:17.078
Offer them an at bat.

09:17.121 --> 09:20.995
The offer and the
tradition is first pitch.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.519
I know that,
but with my unique skill set,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.695
I might get lucky
and slap a single.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.871
No one's ever done that.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.004
You're serious.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.179
First at bat I would do.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.094
Otherwise, no. Next.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.313
Regarding Detective
Marino and his son Jay.

09:35.357 --> 09:39.056
CO at 3-7 says
you got it exactly backward.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.971
I do?

09:41.015 --> 09:42.625
I mean, Detective Marino did.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.975
CO says the moment
he heard Jay's old man

09:45.019 --> 09:47.108
was shot,
he went to the kid

09:47.151 --> 09:48.718
and offered to contact
Employee Relations

09:48.762 --> 09:50.502
and have him assigned
to the hospital.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.157
But Jay declined the offer.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.553
Because?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.859
CO didn't know.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.078
But he said Jay not only refused
the assignment,

10:01.122 --> 10:02.863
he's been looking to work
any overtime

10:02.906 --> 10:03.864
that comes by.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.430
Yeah, doesn't make sense.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.128
So it's a he said-he said.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.173
Look, there's
a whole family history

10:09.217 --> 10:12.133
with the NYPD
beyond father and son.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.090
The father's father.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.091
Yeah.And both his brothers

10:14.135 --> 10:16.093
and a couple of cousins.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.574
And the late wife was an
EMT in Westchester County.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.490
And to refuse that duty
at the hospital,

10:21.533 --> 10:23.057
that would be pretty
unprecedented

10:23.100 --> 10:25.015
for a family like that.

10:25.059 --> 10:29.106
Yeah, kind of like
if a Reagan did it.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.037
JANKO:
Skipping school,

10:47.081 --> 10:50.214
getting boozed up... really?

10:50.258 --> 10:51.128
It was just one beer.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.477
Ah, Officer Irving said it was

10:52.521 --> 10:55.219
a 12-pack among four kids.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.047
So what, you never drank
when you were 16?

10:57.091 --> 10:58.701
Sean, this isn't about me,
this is about you.

10:58.745 --> 11:02.444
Being a Reagan means holding
yourself to a higher standard.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.359
And not just because
screwups embarrass

11:04.402 --> 11:05.708
the rest of the family,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.318
but because it is
the right thing to do.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.016
I'm not even a Reagan yet
and I know that.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.539
So you're gonna tell him?

11:10.582 --> 11:13.368
No, I'm not gonna tell him.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.936
But, hey, this card?

11:15.979 --> 11:18.068
This is a one-time deal.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.461
And you just used yours.

11:19.504 --> 11:20.854
Okay, you understand?

11:20.897 --> 11:22.986
Yeah, I guess so.Guess so or you know so?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.596
I know so.
Okay.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.817
Good. Because I'm starting to
sound like your Uncle Jamie

11:27.861 --> 11:30.254
and it is scaring
the hell out of me.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.691
Let's go.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.478
Max was shot?

11:36.521 --> 11:37.609
Shot at.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.394
He got little more
than a scratch.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.396
But we still haven't found
the shooter.

11:41.439 --> 11:44.573
Well, it wasn't me, if that's
what you're insinuating.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.750
What would make you think
we're insinuating it was you?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.143
Well, it's no secret
my ex-husband

11:49.186 --> 11:50.274
and I don't get along.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.233
Well, it's a secret to him.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.713
Max is all about his image.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.758
Bright and cheery,
beloved by everyone.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.281
But the reality's different.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.936
The more his career
heated up,

11:59.980 --> 12:02.199
the more our marriage
froze over.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.071
Pretty soon there was
only enough room

12:04.114 --> 12:06.377
for his patients and his ego.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.292
not his actual wife and son.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.033
Your son, is
that who happens

12:10.077 --> 12:11.426
to be eavesdropping
on us right now?

12:13.776 --> 12:15.430
When you find whoever
shot at my dad,

12:15.473 --> 12:16.779
I'll hire him a lawyer.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.302
Honey, don't say that.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.608
No, please continue.
As a matter of fact,

12:19.651 --> 12:21.828
where were you at 8:05
this morning?NYU.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.612
Little vague.
Could you be more specific?

12:23.655 --> 12:27.224
In Bobst Library at NYU,
studying.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.704
And you, Ms. McCandless?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.751
I was at Morningstar Pilates,
three blocks from here.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.231
Which means neither of us
had anything to do

12:34.275 --> 12:36.843
with whatever this is.

12:36.886 --> 12:40.368
So it's time for you to leave.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.287
Okay.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.868
Anthony.

13:01.911 --> 13:06.307
Uh, Judge Walsh grant
the adjournment?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.830
All 'cause of your stellar work.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.223
It's what I do.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.268
I did some work on my own today.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.838
I disputed the bank charges.

13:15.882 --> 13:16.970
You won't take a hit.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.319
Oh, that's great news.

13:18.362 --> 13:21.191
I also dug around a little
on our Donna woman.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.802
Didn't I say to drop it?

13:22.845 --> 13:24.978
Yeah, that's the beauty
of being the boss.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.414
I get to call the shots.

13:26.457 --> 13:30.766
So I ran her description against
some other complaints,

13:30.810 --> 13:33.203
and I'm pretty sure she's been
making a business out of this.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.553
At least ten other guys gave
similar descriptions.

13:35.597 --> 13:39.079
So I'm just one more schmuck.
Great.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.342
You're not a schmuck.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.909
Now let me see her profile.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.308
Wow. She is a hottie.

13:51.352 --> 13:52.875
What does that mean?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.616
That I'm too much of a schlub
to get her?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.052
That's not what I mean.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.706
Uh, look, right there.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.404
She said she prefers men
with meat on their bones.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.277
She even puts a little emoji
face with the hearts for eyes.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.280
Well, I can see why she swiped
right on you.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.586
Okay, now that you've seen her,
are we done?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.110
Not till she's in jail.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.025
You want her arrested?

14:12.068 --> 14:14.592
Anthony, she's setting up dates
to steal from people.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.073
Your watch alone
is grand larceny.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.858
But if we grab her,
I'll get outed.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.250
As what?

14:20.294 --> 14:22.905
As the idiot who got suckered on
a dating app.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.168
No one is looking at you
as an idiot.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.257
Not yet. Please, Erin.

14:27.301 --> 14:31.392
Uh, my job says that I can see
things coming a mile off.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.264
If people find out, they'll
laugh me out of the building.

14:34.308 --> 14:38.747
Anthony, you are a victim
of a crime.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.315
Now, what do we tell victims
in this building?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.056
There's no reason to feel shame

14:43.099 --> 14:44.274
because you've done
nothing wrong.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.580
That's right.

14:45.623 --> 14:46.798
Now, do you believe that?

14:46.842 --> 14:48.235
Of course I do.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.714
Then act like it.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.197
Fine.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.939
Entranced has
an office in Midtown,

14:56.983 --> 14:59.028
I'm gonna go down there

14:59.072 --> 15:01.117
and see if I can get them
to cough up her real name.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.077
You're not gonna get past the
receptionist without a subpoena.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.296
So how am I supposed to ID her?

15:18.265 --> 15:20.049
ABETEMARCO:
Come on, just one fingerprint

15:20.093 --> 15:23.705
or some hair to pull
this Donna's DNA off.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.533
Wow.What, you found something?

15:25.576 --> 15:27.665
No, I'm--

15:27.709 --> 15:28.971
I can't get over this place.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.755
It's so nice and neat.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.975
Why, is that weird?No, it's just...

15:33.019 --> 15:35.282
your office always looks like
a bomb blew up.

15:35.325 --> 15:38.459
Oh, so I'm a fatso,
a schmuck and a slob.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.026
That's not what I mean.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.549
I mean that any date

15:41.592 --> 15:45.727
would be thrilled to meet
a guy with such great taste.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.250
Yeah, well,
you got to make an effort.

15:47.294 --> 15:51.167
Not all of us have the luxury
of booty calls with the ex.

15:51.211 --> 15:54.127
I do not have
booty calls with Jack.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.477
Believe it or not, I'm serious
about finding someone.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.958
It's lonely being single
in this city,

15:59.001 --> 16:01.830
and hooking up ain't half as fun
as an actual relationship.

16:01.873 --> 16:05.181
Not that I could suss out the
real thing anymore, apparently.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.879
Sounds like
you really did like Donna.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.186
What can I say?

16:10.230 --> 16:13.059
She was a looker,
we made each other laugh.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.538
Halfway through dinner,

16:14.582 --> 16:16.540
she leaned over
and kissed me.

16:16.584 --> 16:19.369
Even though it was all an act,
it was nice.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.849
It felt right.

16:20.892 --> 16:24.418
Well, maybe that's why I
sometimes fall back with Jack.

16:24.461 --> 16:27.508
But still, there's more to love
than just feeling right.

16:27.551 --> 16:28.770
Why are you settling?

16:28.813 --> 16:30.424
Good question.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.252
Look, I'm not finding
anything here.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.471
We did what we could.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.778
Let's go.Think you're holding back
on something.

16:45.395 --> 16:48.094
Obviously, uh, CSU will find

16:48.137 --> 16:50.313
my prints on these, but...

16:50.357 --> 16:52.315
they might find her
prints on 'em, too.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.057
You know the expression TMI?

16:55.101 --> 16:57.494
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.801
This goes way beyond that.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.415
Eddie, it's no big deal.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.243
It is. I told Sean
I wouldn't say anything

17:07.287 --> 17:09.811
and I blabbed
after five seconds.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.421
Just to me,
that doesn't count.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.816
In your family, are there, like,
rules about who knows what?

17:14.859 --> 17:16.209
What do you mean?

17:16.252 --> 17:17.862
Is it like all for one
and one for all

17:17.906 --> 17:19.429
or are there secrets?

17:19.473 --> 17:20.604
No secrets, really.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.997
Certain things are
on a need-to-know basis.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.869
Like you giving the boys
courtesy cards, for example.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.915
Okay.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.091
It's good what you did, okay?

17:29.135 --> 17:30.527
Any of us would
tell you the same.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.967
Oh, look who it is.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.666
Danny, come to see the new digs?

17:38.709 --> 17:41.103
Nah, actually, I was on
my way back to the squad.Mm.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.323
After being called in
to Sean's school today.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.586
What's the problem?Oh.

17:45.629 --> 17:46.848
Well, what isn't the problem?

17:46.891 --> 17:48.458
I mean, he picked a fight
with some kid,

17:48.502 --> 17:49.851
he hasn't been doing
his homework

17:49.894 --> 17:50.852
and his grades are slipping.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.810
That's rough.No.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.030
Rough is me getting
the whole truth out of him.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.814
Including the part about you
getting him off the hook

17:56.858 --> 17:57.946
for underage drinking.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.209
Danny, I was only
trying to help.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.690
Trying to help? By not
telling his own father?

18:02.733 --> 18:05.040
And what about you? You
couldn't tell me either?

18:05.084 --> 18:08.087
Danny, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.131
Look, you two want
to raise kids,

18:09.175 --> 18:10.437
feel free to have your own.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.700
But leave raising Sean
and Jack to me, okay?

18:20.186 --> 18:23.928
Fingerprint gave us her
real name: Maude Weaver.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.930
Maude? No wonder
she picked Donna.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.193
She got a record?

18:27.236 --> 18:28.324
Long as her legs.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.543
You get an address?

18:29.586 --> 18:30.848
Multiple.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.242
Various landlords said
she liked to live large,

18:33.286 --> 18:34.852
and when she
runs out of money,

18:34.896 --> 18:37.768
she offers to trade sex for
rent or skips out altogether.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.205
Current place?

18:39.248 --> 18:40.902
I couldn't find it.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.251
So no way to track her down?

18:42.295 --> 18:44.166
Could go back on the app.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.125
Matched with her once,
might happen again.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.735
But she'd know it was you.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.782
She ain't the only one
that can make a fake profile.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.005
So we decided to watch security
footage from nearby buildings.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.876
Every single minute of it.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.356
Did you, uh,
see the man who shot at me?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.706
Unfortunately, no, but we
did find someone else

19:02.750 --> 19:04.534
who was very
interesting, a woman,

19:04.578 --> 19:06.928
standing outside at various
times of various days,

19:06.971 --> 19:08.930
but always looking up
at this building

19:08.973 --> 19:10.410
and in particular,
at this office.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.151
We think she might be an
accomplice to the shooter.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.195
You recognize her?

19:14.805 --> 19:16.067
You're kidding me.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.286
So you do recognize her.

19:17.330 --> 19:21.812
Yeah, her-her name is, um,
Noelle King.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.858
She was hired as our
receptionist a couple weeks ago.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.904
Well, is she working today?
I don't see her anywhere.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.515
That's 'cause she quit
after one shift.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.169
I guess it's a thing
these days.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.780
Kids ghost on their dates and
now they ghost on their jobs.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.348
Why would she?That's what doesn't
make any sense.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.915
I pay very well,
she was great at the job,

19:37.959 --> 19:39.961
but when she didn't come back,
we checked to see

19:40.004 --> 19:41.963
if she stole anything,
but she didn't.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.443
You have an address
or a phone number?

19:43.486 --> 19:45.749
Yeah. Yeah,
I even have, uh, her paycheck

19:45.793 --> 19:47.011
for the one day she worked.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.709
If you find her
you can give it to her.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.808
No formalities today, Officer.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.610
Sit down.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.842
Cop comes to One PP,
headed for the 14th floor.

20:34.885 --> 20:38.846
Seems like everybody in the
building knows it, clocks it.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.195
Thought this would be simpler.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.548
I'm suddenly trying to remember
every screwup I've made lately

20:45.592 --> 20:47.028
and I'm-I'm not coming up...

20:47.071 --> 20:48.812
That's not why you're here.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.772
Well, that's good to know, sir.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.382
Actually, from what I read,

20:53.426 --> 20:56.342
you have excellent
evaluations from your COs

20:56.385 --> 20:58.561
and a good number of
"attaboys" from the public.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.302
Just doing my job, sir.

21:00.346 --> 21:03.087
I do have a question for you.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.960
You don't have to answer it.

21:06.003 --> 21:08.745
I'm not sure what
that means, Commissioner.

21:08.789 --> 21:12.314
It means it's police business,
but not official.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.230
Okay.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.102
Did you turn down a posting

21:18.146 --> 21:20.583
to the hospital
after your dad was shot,

21:20.627 --> 21:23.934
or did somebody drop the ball?

21:28.330 --> 21:30.767
No one dropped the ball, sir.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.423
You're a beat cop
with a master's degree

21:34.467 --> 21:36.338
in urban planning.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.340
Yes.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.343
You had a question for me, sir?

21:41.387 --> 21:44.259
I just asked it.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.958
Look, Jay,

21:48.002 --> 21:50.613
I've heard just about
every story there is,

21:50.657 --> 21:54.835
a whole lot of 'em around
my own dining room table,

21:54.878 --> 21:56.445
so...

21:58.491 --> 22:01.276
I never wanted to be a cop.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.108
But it's all
my dad ever wanted.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.023
Granddad and uncles, too.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.982
It's all anyone could ever talk
about at family get-togethers

22:12.026 --> 22:13.984
and summers up at Pottsgrove.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.247
I know that drill.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.424
Policing's in my genes.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.340
But not in your gut.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.908
But it's too late now.

22:24.952 --> 22:28.085
My dad's bounced from active
duty 'cause of the injury.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.914
If there was a time for me
to go, it's already passed.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.264
And I love my dad.

22:37.486 --> 22:41.621
I didn't take the post
because...

22:41.664 --> 22:46.060
I-I just couldn't take
all that brothers-in-blue stuff.

22:46.103 --> 22:48.236
It was bound
to be the whole climate.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.981
If there's nothing else, sir...

22:54.024 --> 22:56.636
No, there's nothing else.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.162
Look, Jay...

23:01.205 --> 23:04.731
I promise you this will stay
between you and me.

defining moment yet.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.973
Defining moment?As a cop.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.933
We all got that one time,
that one action--

23:32.976 --> 23:38.199
the nickel drops, we all go,
"I love this job."

How long has he been

23:39.243 --> 23:40.636
onthe job?A little over

23:40.680 --> 23:43.465
four and a half years,
which brings his family's total

23:43.509 --> 23:45.815
to somewhere around
a century of service.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.121
Well, that's
quite a legacy.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.992
Yeah, he should be proud,
not whiny.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.734
He wasn't whiny, Sid.

Is this a first--
you with no opinion?

23:54.737 --> 23:57.436
As is often pointed out,
I'm not a cop.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.915
I'm well aware.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.483
So I have what is certain to be

a distinctly and likely
unwelcome minority opinion.

I like that.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.494
As a non-cop,

I don't go all butterscotch
and marshmallows

24:14.583 --> 24:16.803
talking about a
big cop family.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.369
And therefore?

24:18.413 --> 24:20.197
What if we were talking
about a surgeon

24:20.241 --> 24:21.677
from a long line of surgeons?

24:21.721 --> 24:23.723
Only this surgeon's
only a surgeon

24:23.766 --> 24:24.854
because he felt pressured

24:24.898 --> 24:26.377
to be one. He hates it.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.249
But he didn't want
to disappoint his family.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.515
You want him operating on you?

24:38.433 --> 24:41.828
Garrett, that's not
the same thing.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.570
GARRETT:
No? What if he's covering you
in a police action,

24:44.613 --> 24:46.659
and the guns come out?
Has he ever

24:46.702 --> 24:48.182
fired his weapon in
the line of duty?

24:48.225 --> 24:51.054
I didn't go through
every page in his file.

24:51.098 --> 24:55.145
Let's assume he's one of the 99%
in the department who hasn't.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.887
What if his partner's
life's at stake?

24:57.931 --> 25:00.020
Remember, his

Never was.

He's not coming.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.184
What?

You're the sucker
this time, Maude.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.232
Who are you?

25:38.275 --> 25:41.235
Long version--
I'm the person that discovered

25:41.278 --> 25:43.672
you have a history
of arrests up and down

25:43.716 --> 25:45.761
the Eastern seaboard,

25:45.805 --> 25:48.459
along with some outstanding
warrants for theft, fraud

25:48.503 --> 25:50.549
and conspiracy. Short version
is-- I'm the person

25:50.592 --> 25:52.289
who's putting you in jail.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.817
I am so sorry,
but you have the wrong person.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.908
My name isn't... "Maude,"
and I didn't do any of that.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.866
Yes, it is, and yes, you did.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.739
And you did worse.
You preyed on

26:06.782 --> 26:08.610
men's insecurities
to get them to drop their guard,

26:08.654 --> 26:11.352
as well as their pants,
but this time, you screwed up

26:11.395 --> 26:12.788
'cause you did it to a friend.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.355
ABETEMARCO:
That would be me,

26:14.398 --> 26:17.358

Remember these, Maude?

Come on. Get up.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.541
Come on.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.767
So, Jack, have you signed
up for your classes?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.116
Not yet.
When I get done on Thursday.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.726
Most of them will
already be filled up.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.815
Seriously
Nobody knows.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.382
Just the way it
works for freshmen.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.166
Not the classes
that he's gonna take.How do you know?

26:43.210 --> 26:44.559
Well, he wants to take
all the hardest classes

26:44.603 --> 26:45.734
to show what
a grind he is.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.649
Shut up.
DANNY:
All right, enough.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.216
You figure out
your major yet, bud?

26:49.259 --> 26:51.087
Yeah, major loser.Hey, zip it.

26:51.131 --> 26:54.090
Not sure yet.

What are you
talking about?Well,

26:59.313 --> 27:02.098
philosophy and creative writing
and such are great

27:02.142 --> 27:05.058
if you're looking for a job

27:05.101 --> 27:06.059
Come on, Pop.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.975
I have a job,

27:09.018 --> 27:10.933
one I love,
a good one.
DANNY:
One which

27:10.977 --> 27:13.370
also has nothing to
do with your major.

27:13.414 --> 27:14.850
Hence his point.
NICKY:
Yeah.

27:14.894 --> 27:17.113
Well, it made me look
at the world in a different way.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.506
JAMIE: Um, I'm with
Eddie. I think

27:18.549 --> 27:21.683
that studying law gave me
a whole new perspective.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.772
I majored in botany
until I didn't.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.208
And I turned out just fine.DANNY:
Not for nothing,

27:25.252 --> 27:27.602
but that's usually you let
someone else say about you.

27:27.646 --> 27:28.995
It's just a fact, Danny.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.474
They'll probably get
good jobs right away,

27:30.518 --> 27:32.041
but the least happy
people at my school

27:32.085 --> 27:33.521
are the ones
majoring in business

27:33.564 --> 27:34.914
and economics.

27:34.957 --> 27:38.047
I'm gonna say something
I very rarely say.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.919
Don't listen to Pop on this one.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.355
Really?

27:41.398 --> 27:44.706
In a few days, you're gonna
be gone from this place,

27:44.750 --> 27:47.709
starting out in the
world on your own.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.669
Make the world your own.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.410
Take what is useful
from your time with us,

27:53.454 --> 27:57.153
your years around this table,

27:57.197 --> 28:00.504
but don't think you
have to become us.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.682
But if you do...

28:03.725 --> 28:05.292
You do.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.989
If you don't,

28:07.033 --> 28:08.991
you don't.

28:09.035 --> 28:13.822
It's your life, not ours.

28:15.519 --> 28:18.740
And I like to think
that your dad

28:18.784 --> 28:22.526
and your aunt and your uncle
do what they do

28:22.570 --> 28:25.442
because they were drawn to it,

28:25.486 --> 28:28.968
not because they were pushed.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.192
I like to think.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.500
I hope, anyway.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.202
Anyway...

28:46.246 --> 28:48.683
to Jack.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.210
Happy trails.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.170
Good luck.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.912
Godspeed.

29:08.050 --> 29:10.009
This is the
last of them.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.140
Thanks.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.925
You're welcome.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.188
Hey, Danny?
Yeah.

29:15.231 --> 29:18.060
Look... I don't want to keep
butting in your business.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.759
Right, 'cause that's
Eddie's job now.

29:20.802 --> 29:25.198
I think I know why
Sean's been acting out lately.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.026
He doesn't want Jack
to leave.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.419
Funny way to show it by
ragging on him all the time.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.117
He's been showing it
the whole time--

29:31.160 --> 29:32.640
by getting busted,
the trouble at school.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.207
Sean's trying

29:34.250 --> 29:36.470
to be a problem
so that Jack'll decide

29:36.513 --> 29:39.386
to stick around and keep
his kid brother in line.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.823
And you know this how,
Mr. Freud?

29:41.867 --> 29:44.217
'Cause I did the same thing
when you left for the Marines.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.045
Oh, what happened? Did you get
a B

29:46.088 --> 29:47.829
A-minus. It was a dark time.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.789
Uh-huh. Do me a favor--
leave the parenting to me.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.181
I was just trying
to help, Danny.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.356
You want to help, help Eddie.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.662
Help Eddie what?

29:54.705 --> 29:56.359

Oh, look, I love her,

29:56.403 --> 29:59.972
and she's great, sincerely,

30:00.015 --> 30:02.148
but the two of you need
to mind your business.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.802
We already apologized
for that, Danny.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.716
You got a problem
with that, go to hell.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.251
She's all yours.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.861

Abetemarco?

30:19.905 --> 30:22.864
Nah, me and Maude have spent
enough time together.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.648
Besides, I'm gonna
take the stand against her.

30:24.692 --> 30:25.736
Like, in public?

30:25.780 --> 30:27.216
Whatever it takes.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.914
Drop by later to get your cuffs.

30:28.957 --> 30:31.917
Mm, might want
to wash those first.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.266
Could you not?

30:33.309 --> 30:35.094
What?

30:35.137 --> 30:36.660
I'm proud of you.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.880
It takes a lot
to stand up and be counted.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.622
I got work to do.

30:41.665 --> 30:45.191
Dinner later? I've got a friend
from the Brooklyn DA's office.

30:45.234 --> 30:49.369
I think I'm done dating
for a while, but thanks.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.555
Am I being arrested?

31:01.598 --> 31:03.383
That depends on why you've
been hanging around down

31:03.426 --> 31:05.124
at the medical tower
on Chambers Street.

Almost like she's a magician.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.438
Now answer the question.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.397
Right, um,

31:17.440 --> 31:19.660
no, I-I worked in that building
for a couple weeks.

31:19.703 --> 31:22.750
You mean a couple hours.
Eight hours, in fact.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.056
Then you left,

31:24.099 --> 31:26.058
then you came back
and cased the joint

31:26.101 --> 31:27.929

Who's the guy?

Dr. McCandless.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.898
Why would I want Dr. McCandless
dead? He's my father.

31:40.811 --> 31:41.856
Come again?

31:45.904 --> 31:49.646
All my life, this man,
Roy King, has been my dad...

31:49.690 --> 31:51.518

31:51.561 --> 31:54.477
those genealogy things
where you send in your DNA,

31:54.521 --> 31:57.872
and it told me
that this man is not my dad.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.354
I asked my mom

32:01.397 --> 32:04.923
if I was adopted,
and she said no.

32:04.966 --> 32:08.143
In fact, they had gone
to this amazing doctor

32:08.187 --> 32:10.624
for IVF to get pregnant.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.234
The Baby Magician.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.716
I found a video
of Dr. McCandless online.

32:15.759 --> 32:16.978
I just...

32:17.022 --> 32:19.415
I just saw myself in him.

32:19.459 --> 32:22.766
So you got a job at his clinic
to get his DNA?

32:22.810 --> 32:25.204
Yeah, from his coffee cup.
And it proved it.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.640
That your mother had an affair?

32:26.683 --> 32:28.294
No.

32:28.337 --> 32:31.427
Never in a million years.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.299
So, then, how did you...?

32:36.432 --> 32:37.999
Wait a minute.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.394
Dr. McCandless used
his own sperm in the IVF?

32:46.747 --> 32:49.402
Who else knows about this?

32:49.445 --> 32:52.274
There's a Web forum
of other kids

32:52.318 --> 32:54.581
who were born
because of Dr. McCandless.

32:54.624 --> 32:57.149
There are more kids

32:57.192 --> 32:59.978
I-I don't know, I just...

33:00.021 --> 33:02.981
I went online and asked around
if anyone else had ever felt

33:03.024 --> 33:05.113
like their dads
weren't their dads.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.334
Could be one of them's
our shooter.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.379
We're gonna need
all their names.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.338
I-I don't have them.
I mean, people use screen names.

33:12.381 --> 33:15.732
I-I swear, I did not mean
to make anyone want to kill him.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.478
Unbelievable.

33:22.522 --> 33:25.351
McCandless is playing God
when really he's a monster.

33:25.394 --> 33:28.136
He better hope the shooter
finds him before we do.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.790
Sit tight.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.411
Thank you so much,
Dr. McCandless.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.370
We thought
we'd never see this day.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.372
Or have such a beautiful baby.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.287
Take care. I'll see
all three of you in a month.Yeah.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.592
McCANDLESS:
Huh?
There he is.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.464
BAEZ:
Secure all computers,

33:51.507 --> 33:53.161
data, medical samples.

33:53.205 --> 33:55.555
What is this?You're getting knocked
off your pedestal

33:55.598 --> 33:57.644
like you deserve.
Step back, please.I-I didn't do anything.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.994
DANNY: Give me
your hands.Wait, wait, wait a minute.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.126
Take it easy there.
I'm the victim.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.736
Somebody tried to kill me.

34:02.779 --> 34:05.217
Because you've been knocking up
your own patients for years.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.349
What I did was help people.

34:07.393 --> 34:08.742
Folks, this is-this is all

34:08.785 --> 34:10.135
a misunderstanding.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.614
How many families' lives
are gonna be ripped apart

34:11.658 --> 34:12.789
because of what you did?

34:12.833 --> 34:14.965
How many more kids
like Noelle King?

34:16.010 --> 34:17.751
Noelle was one?

34:17.794 --> 34:19.709
What's the matter, you don't
recognize your own daughter?

34:19.753 --> 34:21.189
That must be tough.
There's got to be quite a few.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.061
What do you got, hundreds,
maybe thousands out there?

34:23.104 --> 34:24.975
Exactly, exactly,
what I did was give people

34:25.019 --> 34:26.238
the children
that they begged for.

34:26.281 --> 34:27.804
Why am I the bad guy?

34:27.848 --> 34:28.762
Move it.Maybe some of your kids

34:28.805 --> 34:30.024
will visit you in prison.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.808
They can explain it to you.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.201
Reagan.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.029
Noelle?

34:35.073 --> 34:37.118
Noelle? No, slow down.
What are you talking about?

34:38.902 --> 34:41.340
We're on our way.

34:41.383 --> 34:42.558
What's going on?

34:42.602 --> 34:44.778
I think we found our shooter.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.803
Gonna need you

35:09.846 --> 35:12.022
to put that gun down
facing the water.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.329
Right on the bench, Roy.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.157
How did you...?Your daughter

35:16.201 --> 35:18.464
Noelle fessed up it was you
who went after McCandless--

35:18.507 --> 35:21.597
after she lied
and blamed somebody else.

35:23.338 --> 35:25.340
She covered for me?

35:25.384 --> 35:26.689
Yeah.

35:26.733 --> 35:27.821
That is, until you went

35:27.864 --> 35:30.215
and said good-bye
about an hour ago.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.086
She told me
I could find you here.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.524
This is where we
always would come.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.224
Not anymore.

35:39.267 --> 35:42.052
Hey. Take your finger

35:42.096 --> 35:43.880
off the trigger
there, Roy, okay?

35:43.924 --> 35:46.056
You do not want
to hurt yourself.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.755
Just like you didn't want
to kill Dr. McCandless.

35:48.798 --> 35:49.886
Like hell I didn't.

35:49.930 --> 35:51.497
You missed a dozen shots
at close range.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.238
No one's that bad of a shot,
okay?

35:54.587 --> 35:56.763
Why did he do what he did?

35:56.806 --> 35:58.678
Why did he hurt those people?

35:58.721 --> 36:00.114
I'm not the person to ask.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.898
When Noelle told
me, I just...

36:02.943 --> 36:05.206
I lost my mind. I...

36:05.250 --> 36:09.036
And you'll go before a judge
and tell him the story.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.386
And nobody's gonna blame you.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.388
But don't do
something stupid now

36:13.432 --> 36:15.912
and make it even worse, okay?

36:15.956 --> 36:17.566
Just put the gun down.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.569
Come on.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.362
I don't care what happens.

36:30.405 --> 36:33.365
It's not like I have
a family anymore.

36:33.408 --> 36:37.151
I think there's somebody
who would disagree

36:37.195 --> 36:39.806
with that assessment.
Turn around.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.637
Dad.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.509
You lied to protect me?

36:47.553 --> 36:49.859
I would do anything for my dad.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.775
'Cause that's who you are
and who you always will be.

36:57.606 --> 37:00.957
Dad, Mom needs us. Both of us.

37:08.922 --> 37:13.013
We'll make a detour on the way
back to the squad, okay?

37:16.799 --> 37:19.933
Only a couple more, which
is a relief for my back.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.109
Lightweight.

37:22.152 --> 37:24.938
Very funny. Go help your uncle.

37:24.981 --> 37:27.332
So, why is Danny
having us see him off?

37:27.375 --> 37:29.508
Oh, maybe to show us
how good a dad he is.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.814
Rub it in our faces a bit.

37:31.858 --> 37:34.991
Let me grab that.
Yo.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.558
Thank you.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.387
I'm gonna miss you guys.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.347
Have fun, man.I will.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.131
Hey, we're only
a phone call away.

37:44.174 --> 37:45.393
I know, I know.Here.

37:45.437 --> 37:46.742
That's a little mad money
for you.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.831
Put that in your pocket,
all right?

37:48.875 --> 37:50.746
Sean, come on, man.

37:50.790 --> 37:53.358
Come say good-bye
to your brother.

37:53.401 --> 37:56.274
All right. I guess
I'll, uh, see you around.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.971
Actually, you're coming with us.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.452
I am?Yeah, it was Dad's idea.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.497
Figured you'll help me
get settled in,

38:02.541 --> 38:03.933
then we'll cruise
around campus.

38:03.977 --> 38:04.978
This way you know what's what

38:05.021 --> 38:06.022
for when you visit
on the weekends.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.502
Okay, cool.How does that sound?

38:07.546 --> 38:08.895
Good?
Awesome, yeah.
Come on, let's go.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.376
I'll be right there.

38:11.419 --> 38:14.683
Hey, I just, uh, want
to say sorry to you guys.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.032
Especially you, Eddie.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.338
No, I screwed up, Danny.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.383
No, I screwed up, as usual,

38:18.426 --> 38:19.906
running around with my hair

38:19.949 --> 38:21.908
on fire, and you were just
trying to help and look out,

38:21.951 --> 38:23.953
so... sorry.
I hope you forgive me.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.609
Hey. Yeah.
Yeah.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.959
Thanks. I don't want to hug you.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.918
I don't want to hug you.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.007
I could use some of
that mad money, though.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.269
It's expensive
raising these two.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.575
I got a little circus
of my own coming up.

38:36.618 --> 38:37.706
It's called a wedding.

38:37.750 --> 38:41.057
Right. Well, you chose well.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.755
Let's not go overboard.Hey.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.322
What?

38:48.151 --> 38:50.153
Did he say what this is about?

38:50.197 --> 38:52.417
He did not, Officer.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.985
Welcome.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.987
Thanks for the invite.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.383
Please.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.385
Thank you.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.432
FRANK:
Thank you, Baker.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.087
My son Jay.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.874
Nice to meet you, Jay.

39:14.917 --> 39:18.094
You, too, sir.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.401
You find that idiot refused
Jay's duty at the hospital?

39:20.445 --> 39:23.273
I did, John.
Heads rolled. All I can say.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.405
Thank you, Frank.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.407
And while I was sorting
the mess out,

39:26.451 --> 39:28.931
I got a look
at your son's service record.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.890
He's got a very valuable degree.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.413
Very proud of him.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.329
Well, you should be.
And I don't need to tell you,

39:35.373 --> 39:37.723
John, about the problems
policing the projects.

39:37.766 --> 39:38.941
You certainly don't.

39:38.985 --> 39:41.379
So I started thinking,
I've always fought

39:41.422 --> 39:44.947
the Housing Development Board
to bring in a cop.

39:44.991 --> 39:47.689
I mean, the projects
should be planned with a nod

39:47.733 --> 39:49.865
towards policing them,
don't you think?

39:49.909 --> 39:52.259
So, it seems to me

39:52.302 --> 39:54.957
someone with Jay's résumé

39:55.001 --> 39:58.091
would be a valuable asset
over there and would be

39:58.134 --> 39:59.658
long after you and
I have gone fishing.

40:02.312 --> 40:04.314
But there's a problem.

40:06.099 --> 40:10.190
They still will not allow a cop
on the board.

40:12.192 --> 40:16.457
And the only solution
would be for him to resign.

40:16.501 --> 40:20.635
And I would never ask Jay
to do that.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.944
Jay...

40:24.987 --> 40:28.164
our police commissioner's
asking us for a favor.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.558
It's up to you, Dad.

40:34.562 --> 40:37.043
Yes, sir.

40:39.088 --> 40:42.135
Good. Good.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.444
You sure about this?

40:47.488 --> 40:50.186
Thank you, sir.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.017
Thank you, Jay.
