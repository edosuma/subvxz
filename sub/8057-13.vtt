WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.240
If I could sum up
the Pawnee Commons

00:03.252 --> 00:05.370
in one word, it would be:

00:05.802 --> 00:07.170
Dynamite.

00:07.172 --> 00:10.240
"Dynamite" stands for
daring, youth-friendly,

00:10.242 --> 00:12.742
natural, amazing, merry,
inviting,

00:12.744 --> 00:15.912
tourist attraction-y,
and eco-friendly.

00:15.914 --> 00:17.464
Thank you,
Councilwoman Knope--

00:17.466 --> 00:18.599
very, very thorough

00:18.601 --> 00:20.851
- and so many acronyms.
- I know.

00:20.853 --> 00:21.852
Councilman Jamm?

00:21.854 --> 00:22.853
Thank you, Bill.

00:22.855 --> 00:25.422
No, please,
everyone be seated.

00:25.424 --> 00:28.757
Let the record show
there was a standing ovation.

00:29.011 --> 00:30.510
- No, there wasn't.
- There was not.

00:30.512 --> 00:31.628
History will decide.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.931
My plan
for lot 48 is simple.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.265
But why read it

00:35.267 --> 00:38.352
when you can shove it
right in your face?

00:38.354 --> 00:39.653
I want to sell this lot
to Paunch Burger.

00:39.655 --> 00:40.654
Here's why.

00:40.656 --> 00:42.138
We make money.
They make money.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.107
They make burgers.
We eat burgers.

00:44.109 --> 00:45.108
Mmhmm.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.361
That's a win-win-win-win.

00:47.363 --> 00:49.246
Presentation over.
Jamm out.

00:49.248 --> 00:50.480
Oh, man.

00:50.482 --> 00:52.532
Are there curly fries?
I love their curly fries.

00:52.534 --> 00:54.150
Ann.

00:54.152 --> 00:56.086
Well, the planning commission
has a week to decide

00:56.088 --> 00:59.089
if they want a beautiful,
innovative community park

00:59.091 --> 01:01.208
or a bunch
of greasy lard bombs.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.509
I'm not editorializing.

01:02.511 --> 01:04.928
Paunch Burger's
number-one-selling burger

01:04.930 --> 01:06.730
is the greasy lard bomb.

01:06.732 --> 01:09.049
Just give me a hint as to
which way you guys are leaning.

01:09.051 --> 01:11.268
Off the record?
We're leaning towards Jamm.

01:11.270 --> 01:13.470
Why? You know my plan
is better for the community.

01:13.472 --> 01:16.805
Oh, it's way better,
but you're also short $50,000.

01:17.009 --> 01:19.109
We can't approve
an underfunded project.

01:19.111 --> 01:20.510
Hey, get the rest
of the money,

01:20.512 --> 01:22.012
you get your park.

01:22.014 --> 01:23.480
You only have a week.

01:23.482 --> 01:25.232
What are we going
to do, guys?

01:25.234 --> 01:26.617
How are we going
to get that money?

01:26.619 --> 01:29.369
Hey, come on.
Cheer up, little pups.

01:29.371 --> 01:30.537
Registering
for your wedding

01:30.539 --> 01:32.155
is the most important moment
of your lives.

01:32.157 --> 01:33.991
Love--
love fades away.

01:33.993 --> 01:37.077
But things...

01:37.079 --> 01:38.912
- Things are forever.
- That's beautiful.

01:38.914 --> 01:40.747
Did the Dalai Lama say that?

01:40.749 --> 01:43.583
Ooh!
A citrus reamer!

01:43.585 --> 01:45.585
Oh, this is the only way
to ream citrus.

01:45.587 --> 01:46.586
You're gonna need
two of these.

01:46.588 --> 01:47.638
I don't want
a citrus reamer.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.039
I don't want
any of this stuff.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.541
Look, all I want is
to be married to you

01:51.543 --> 01:54.511
and to somehow get $50,000.

01:54.513 --> 01:56.379
Hey, hang on.

01:56.381 --> 01:59.016
What if we register for the park
instead of the stuff?

01:59.018 --> 02:01.518
We could organize
a black-tie gala

02:01.520 --> 02:02.602
with food and music

02:02.604 --> 02:04.688
and maybe a silent auction
to raise money.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.106
Yeah,
and people could donate,

02:06.108 --> 02:07.607
or they could bid
to put their names

02:07.609 --> 02:08.609
on everything
in the park,

02:08.610 --> 02:10.243
like benches,
cobblestones,

02:10.245 --> 02:11.778
trees, ants, air.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.030
Right, some of that
is possible.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.665
- You are a genius. Let's go.
- Okay.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.832
Hey, guys.

02:15.834 --> 02:19.002
I'm really feeling
these sheets--very cozy.

02:22.007 --> 02:26.340

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.190 --> 02:40.857
I just want
to say thank you

02:40.859 --> 02:42.309
for all your hard work
this week.

02:42.311 --> 02:43.360
Give yourselves a hand.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.646
But your applause
is premature.

02:46.648 --> 02:48.231
You just told us
to applaud.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.367
Well, if I told you to jump
off a bridge, would you do it?

02:50.369 --> 02:51.985
I hope so,
because the only way

02:51.987 --> 02:53.120
that this gala
is going to happen

02:53.122 --> 02:54.371
is if you do
everything I say.

02:54.373 --> 02:55.872
Tom, I need you
to contact

02:55.874 --> 02:57.407
three more food vendors
on this list,

02:57.409 --> 02:58.658
and they need to do it
for free.

02:58.660 --> 02:59.826
I'm omelet.

02:59.828 --> 03:00.911
Get it?
"I'm on it," "I'm omelet"?

03:00.913 --> 03:02.129
I get it, and I love it,

03:02.131 --> 03:03.747
but I don't have time
for food puns right now.

03:03.749 --> 03:04.831
Okay, I'm heading out.
Good-pie.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.166
Go.

03:06.168 --> 03:08.168
Gurt. Go-gurt.
I'm incredible.

03:08.170 --> 03:09.169
See you guys.

03:09.171 --> 03:10.170
Okay.
Donna, Jerry--

03:11.173 --> 03:12.455
Leslie!

03:12.457 --> 03:14.591
Leslie, we need you back
at the command center right now!

03:14.593 --> 03:16.143
We have a class-one
city emergency.

03:16.145 --> 03:17.761
Oh, my God.
Gayle.

03:17.763 --> 03:19.429
My girls!

03:19.431 --> 03:20.564
What's the emergency?

03:20.566 --> 03:22.132
Oh, this is just a drill,

03:22.134 --> 03:23.967
but I am having so much fun
pretending it's real.

03:23.969 --> 03:25.135
Are you kidding me?

03:25.137 --> 03:27.354
The disaster-preparedness people
picked today?

03:27.356 --> 03:29.940
Each year every city
in Indiana is reviewed

03:29.942 --> 03:32.075
by the Department
of Emergency Preparedness.

03:32.077 --> 03:35.162
And Pawnee has failed
12 years in a row.

03:35.164 --> 03:37.614
On last year's report,
they stated,

03:37.616 --> 03:40.417
"Every time it so much
as drizzles in Pawnee,

03:40.419 --> 03:41.918
"the town is in danger
of collapsing

03:41.920 --> 03:44.337
into Thunderdome-style,
post-apocalyptic mayhem."

03:44.339 --> 03:47.591
Okay, we don't know how long
Leslie's going to be gone,

03:47.593 --> 03:50.127
so let's just knock
some of this stuff off.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.462
Should someone
stop Jerry?

03:53.682 --> 03:55.849
Gayle!

03:55.851 --> 03:59.002
Eh, he'll figure it out
eventually.

03:59.004 --> 04:00.937
First, we do
the written exam,

04:00.939 --> 04:03.356
and then we do
the personality evaluation,

04:03.358 --> 04:05.942
which I feel like I'm gonna
nail, 'cause people always say,

04:05.944 --> 04:08.061
"But he's got
a great personality."

04:09.313 --> 04:11.148
Okay, quiz me.

04:11.150 --> 04:14.483
Okay, what does it mean
when an officer calls in a 3542?

04:14.686 --> 04:16.853
Assault and battery.
The way I remember that,

04:16.855 --> 04:20.887
I picture 35 a-salt shakers
and 42 batteries.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.693
Great. What is
the criminal code for arson?

04:23.695 --> 04:24.995
Arson is 533.

04:24.997 --> 04:26.129
You know how
I remember that?

04:26.131 --> 04:28.832
I picture 533
salt shakers and batteries

04:28.834 --> 04:30.133
lighting a building
on fire.

04:30.135 --> 04:31.802
Oh, I'm nervous.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.369
Babe, look at me.

04:33.371 --> 04:34.671
You are going
to pass this test,

04:34.673 --> 04:36.006
and you are going
to become a cop.

04:36.008 --> 04:38.508
And if you don't,
I'll just divorce you

04:38.510 --> 04:39.676
and marry someone else

04:39.678 --> 04:41.344
and then cheat on them
with you.

04:41.346 --> 04:43.980
Aw, that's so sweet.

04:43.982 --> 04:46.716
Also, I got you
a lucky charm.

04:46.718 --> 04:48.101
I found a dead rabbit
on the side of the road,

04:48.103 --> 04:50.270
and I cut its feet off
and made it into a lucky charm.

04:50.272 --> 04:53.190
Baby, you are so creepy.

04:53.192 --> 04:55.558
Thank you. I love it.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.527
Dwyer, you're up.

04:57.929 --> 04:59.329
My name
is Leonard Tchulm.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.664
I'm head
of the Indiana Department

05:00.666 --> 05:02.699
of Emergency Preparedness.

05:02.701 --> 05:03.950
And today
I'm going to bring

05:03.952 --> 05:05.702
death and destruction
to your town.

05:06.204 --> 05:08.839
I am Leslie Knope.
I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.924
And this year, we are more
than prepared for your test,

05:10.926 --> 05:14.077
but, um, it just so happens,
today is a little inconvenient.

05:14.079 --> 05:15.795
Good, because
the best day for a drill

05:15.797 --> 05:17.247
is when it's inconvenient
for everyone.

05:17.249 --> 05:19.415
My mother is getting
a colonoscopy today.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.601
I'm not even sure there's
anyone there to drive her home,

05:21.603 --> 05:23.520
so we're all making sacrifices,
Ms. Knope.

05:23.522 --> 05:25.355
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear about your mother.

05:25.357 --> 05:27.057
Mm, we're not that close.

05:27.059 --> 05:28.558
Oh. Good.

05:29.561 --> 05:31.594
Okay, volunteer victims,

05:31.596 --> 05:33.596
please put your
identification placards on now

05:33.598 --> 05:35.782
and go to your designated areas
throughout town.

05:35.784 --> 05:37.617
First Responders,
return to your stations,

05:37.619 --> 05:39.619
and the simulation
begins...

05:39.621 --> 05:42.405
N-n-n...

05:45.209 --> 05:47.460
Went past the zero.

05:47.462 --> 05:50.046
I got to wait till it goes...

05:51.782 --> 05:52.799
Okay, now.

05:52.801 --> 05:54.450
All right, officers,
bolt the doors.

05:54.452 --> 05:56.553
We are officially
in lockdown mode.

05:56.555 --> 05:57.837
The doors will not open

05:57.839 --> 06:00.423
until Leonard announces
that this drill is complete.

06:00.425 --> 06:01.624
The most important event

06:01.626 --> 06:03.343
that I have ever organized
in my entire life

06:03.345 --> 06:06.678
is happening in eight hours,
and I am stuck in this room.

06:06.732 --> 06:09.132
This is a nightmare.

06:09.134 --> 06:12.152
Wait.
Maybe this <i>is</i> a nightmare.

06:14.521 --> 06:16.022
Nope, can't fly away.

06:16.024 --> 06:17.274
This is real life.

06:18.524 --> 06:21.274
And now, I'm going to open
one of these ten envelopes at random

06:22.412 --> 06:24.112
to determine
your simulated disaster.

06:25.165 --> 06:27.716
Pawnee
has been hit by...

06:27.718 --> 06:29.000
A strain of avian flu.

06:29.002 --> 06:31.035
Yes! Avian flu!
Jackpot.

06:31.037 --> 06:32.470
This is a simple one, guys.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.139
Everybody
open their binders, okay?

06:34.141 --> 06:36.842
- "The Knope Protocol"?
- Uh, correction.

06:36.844 --> 06:39.895
That's "Mission Im-Pawnee-able:
Knope Protocol."

06:39.897 --> 06:42.013
Now, if everyone just
follows my instructions,

06:42.015 --> 06:44.566
we will ace this test, and
we will be done in 90 minutes.

06:44.568 --> 06:47.385
"Step one--
insert the DVD scenario."

06:47.387 --> 06:49.387
Hmm, what could be on this?

06:49.389 --> 06:51.556
Good evening,
this is Channel 4 lead anchor

06:51.558 --> 06:52.891
Willow Tremaine,
with breaking news.

06:52.893 --> 06:55.827
Avian flu has just
hit the town of Pawnee.

06:55.829 --> 06:58.196
We go live now
to St. Joseph's Medical Center

06:58.198 --> 06:59.898
for an update.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.032
Hello, my name is

07:01.034 --> 07:02.784
Donatella Breckinridge, M.D.
I graduated

07:02.786 --> 07:04.587
first in my class
from Harvard Medical School,

07:04.588 --> 07:05.737
so I know
what I'm talking about.

07:05.739 --> 07:08.874
This is the avian flu,
or we call "H5N1."

07:08.876 --> 07:11.910
Donna, are we on schedule
for the tent setup?

07:11.912 --> 07:13.929
The tables showed up,
which is good,

07:13.931 --> 07:15.931
but there are no chairs,
which is bad.

07:15.933 --> 07:19.266
Okay, well, get some chairs
from somewhere.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.637
Great leadership--
inspiring.

07:22.639 --> 07:25.190
Oh, God. Leslie was gonna
go on <i>Pawnee Today</i>

07:25.192 --> 07:28.525
- to promote the gala.
- I'll do it.

07:28.528 --> 07:31.196
No offense, Ron, but I don't
think you'd be great on TV.

07:31.198 --> 07:33.865
I can speak in full sentences,
and I won't cry.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.200
Fair point.
I did cry last time.

07:37.204 --> 07:39.621
Godspeed.

07:39.623 --> 07:42.956
Mmm! Smells amazing, Chef.
What you cooking?

07:43.126 --> 07:45.243
Little coq au vin?
Little bouillabaisse?

07:45.245 --> 07:47.579
You can stop
the ass-kissing, Haverford.

07:47.581 --> 07:49.965
I know why you're here.
I cannot do the gala.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.282
It doesn't make
business sense

07:51.284 --> 07:52.801
to cater something that big
for free.

07:52.803 --> 07:55.136
Please. If the gala
doesn't go perfectly,

07:55.138 --> 07:56.638
the lot could become
a Paunch Burger.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.924
Doesn't that offend your refined
Parisian sensibilities?

07:58.926 --> 08:00.475
I'm from Orlando.

08:00.477 --> 08:02.260
And I don't care
about the Paunch Burger.

08:02.262 --> 08:05.595
If it was another French
restaurant, maybe I'd worry.

08:07.566 --> 08:08.733
Hey!
Well, you know what?

08:08.735 --> 08:10.435
What? What?

08:10.437 --> 08:12.303
What you got for me?
Get out of my kitchen!

08:12.305 --> 08:13.521
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

08:13.523 --> 08:14.774
<i>Pardon! Pardon!</i>

08:15.776 --> 08:16.908
Hey,
can you hear me?

08:16.910 --> 08:18.977
Oh!
Leslie, you on the TV!

08:18.979 --> 08:20.645
Well,
you're on mine, Brett.

08:20.647 --> 08:23.114
- We're having a video conference.
- Oh, okay.

08:23.116 --> 08:25.116
Pawnee has been hit
with the avian flu.

08:25.518 --> 08:27.619
- Tight.
- No, this is bad news.

08:27.621 --> 08:29.454
I need everyone there
at Animal Control

08:29.456 --> 08:32.256
to eradicate
all the infected birds in town.

08:32.259 --> 08:35.176
"Kill all birds."

08:35.178 --> 08:37.345
- This is for the drill, right?
- Yes.

08:37.347 --> 08:39.681
But I'm actually gonna kill
these birds for real?

08:39.683 --> 08:41.549
No.
No, just pretend.

08:41.551 --> 08:44.335
Right. So how do I kill 'em--
like, with a gun?

08:44.337 --> 08:45.837
No.

08:45.839 --> 08:47.939
I could fill up a bathtub and
just drown 'em one at a time.

08:47.941 --> 08:49.858
Okay, let's forget
we ever talked.

08:49.860 --> 08:50.976
Got it. Kill 'em.

08:50.978 --> 08:53.061
Okay, casualty update--
only four dead,

08:53.063 --> 08:55.697
two of whom were already
gravely ill and brothers.

08:55.699 --> 08:57.348
That family
took a terrible hit.

08:57.350 --> 08:58.483
Well, that's great news.

08:58.485 --> 09:00.351
Not so fast.
I regret to inform you

09:00.353 --> 09:02.654
that someone in this room
has begun exhibiting symptoms--

09:02.656 --> 09:05.156
- Christopher Traeger.
- What?

09:05.158 --> 09:08.376
A few months ago, the thought
of an infectious disease,

09:08.378 --> 09:10.128
even hypothetical,
would have sent me

09:10.130 --> 09:12.196
careening
towards Bummerville,

09:12.198 --> 09:15.531
but now I am infected
with a killer virus,

09:16.553 --> 09:18.720
and I feel fine.

09:18.722 --> 09:20.055
Therapy!

09:20.057 --> 09:21.473
This is
highly irregular.

09:21.475 --> 09:23.207
We have followed protocol
to the letter.

09:23.209 --> 09:24.509
No, you did not.

09:24.511 --> 09:26.344
Unfortunately, no one contacted
the transit department

09:26.346 --> 09:27.479
to shut down bus service.

09:27.481 --> 09:30.214
So you rode a bus
with a contagious man,

09:30.216 --> 09:32.350
and he infected you
and 39 others.

09:32.352 --> 09:34.235
That is impossible.
I do not ride the bus.

09:34.237 --> 09:36.387
I ride my bicycle behind the bus
as a windbreak.

09:36.389 --> 09:38.056
Doesn't matter.
Prepare for the diarrhea.

09:38.058 --> 09:40.725
Okay, who was supposed to deal
with Transit?

09:44.580 --> 09:47.699
My bad, guys. That's my bad.
Chris, very sorry.

09:47.701 --> 09:49.067
Damn it, Jamm.

09:49.069 --> 09:50.902
I should've had animal control
kill you.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.904
- Oh, who you want me to kill?
- No one.

09:52.906 --> 09:54.238
I'll kill him...

09:54.240 --> 09:56.591
As soon as I'm done
with these birds.

09:57.093 --> 09:58.726
Hello.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.561
I'm here for the interview
about tonight's gala.

10:01.598 --> 10:04.415
Yeah, listen, I'm a little
under the weather.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.084
I went on a booze cruise
last week.

10:06.586 --> 10:08.686
It just finished up
an hour ago.

10:08.688 --> 10:13.809
On a completely unrelated note,
I have horrible allergies.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.343
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

10:15.345 --> 10:17.862
But I do need
to promote this event.

10:17.864 --> 10:19.814
Don't worry about me.
I'm a true professional.

10:19.816 --> 10:21.682
The show must go on.
In five, four, three...

10:21.684 --> 10:23.151
Two...

10:23.153 --> 10:26.486
Hello.
I'm Joan Callamezzo.

10:26.873 --> 10:30.206
Today's show will not go on.

10:36.215 --> 10:38.066
It seems like her allergies
are kicking in.

10:39.336 --> 10:41.669
My name is Ron Swanson.

10:41.671 --> 10:43.054
I am here to tell you

10:43.056 --> 10:46.040
about a black-tie gala
fund-raiser for Pawnee Commons

10:46.042 --> 10:47.175
happening tonight.

10:47.177 --> 10:49.911
All proceeds will go
toward building a park.

10:49.913 --> 10:51.746
It will be enjoyable.

10:51.748 --> 10:53.681
Take a--
take a phone call.

10:53.683 --> 10:55.833
Now I will take your calls,
apparently.

10:55.835 --> 10:57.318
Yes?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.020
Hey, Joan,
settle a bet for me.

10:59.022 --> 11:01.356
Who's the sexiest couple
in history?

11:01.358 --> 11:03.574
R-Patz and K-Stew,
or Bieber--

11:06.996 --> 11:08.396
Hey, how's it going?

11:08.398 --> 11:11.731
Uh, well, this simulated
disaster is a total disaster.

11:11.835 --> 11:12.917
How are you?

11:12.919 --> 11:15.169
Ron subbed for you
on <i>Pawnee Today.</i>

11:15.171 --> 11:18.239
Ron who? Ron Swanson?
On television?

11:18.241 --> 11:20.875
You know we <i>want</i>
people to come, right?

11:20.877 --> 11:22.543
Donna still can't find
any chairs.

11:22.545 --> 11:23.795
We don't know where Jerry is.

11:23.797 --> 11:25.880
And now some firemen are using

11:25.882 --> 11:28.466
the lot as a triage center
for the emergency drill.

11:28.468 --> 11:30.101
Okay, here's what you do.
Listen to me caref--

11:30.103 --> 11:31.886
Attention.
Panic from the outbreak

11:31.888 --> 11:33.521
has overloaded
cell phone towers.

11:33.523 --> 11:35.473
Please deposit your phones
into this box.

11:35.475 --> 11:36.924
Oh, my God,
this drill will never end.

11:36.926 --> 11:38.609
- Okay, tell the firefighters...
- All phones.

11:38.611 --> 11:40.395
To set up triage
at the high school...

11:40.397 --> 11:41.529
- All phones.
- And then to--

11:41.531 --> 11:42.596
but I'm talking
to someone important.

11:42.598 --> 11:43.731
- All phones.
- Let me tell him

11:43.733 --> 11:45.316
something important.
Fix it, Ben! Fix it!

11:45.318 --> 11:46.484
Okay.

11:46.486 --> 11:48.536
What?

11:48.538 --> 11:51.372
I found one chair,
got a lead on a second.

11:51.374 --> 11:53.741
Keep me posted.

11:53.743 --> 11:55.609
So this test will determine

11:55.611 --> 11:57.712
whether you have
the right personality profile

11:57.714 --> 11:58.796
to be a police officer.

11:58.798 --> 12:00.832
Just to make sure
the machine is working,

12:00.834 --> 12:03.084
is your name Andy?

12:03.086 --> 12:05.253
I don't know
how to answer that.

12:05.255 --> 12:08.406
- A simple "yes" or "no."
- Well, everyone calls me Andy,

12:08.408 --> 12:10.808
but my full name is Andrew,
I think,

12:10.810 --> 12:13.144
so...

12:13.146 --> 12:14.896
No?

12:14.898 --> 12:16.630
Wait. Yes.

12:16.632 --> 12:17.965
Let's move on.

12:17.967 --> 12:20.067
Scenario--
a high-school-aged child

12:20.069 --> 12:21.936
asks to hold
your service revolver.

12:21.938 --> 12:22.937
What do you do?

12:22.939 --> 12:25.072
Yes, I give it to him.

12:25.074 --> 12:27.442
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to hold a cop's gun.

12:27.444 --> 12:30.144
To make that dream come true
for another kid--

12:30.146 --> 12:32.914
Well, that's what being a cop
is all about.

12:32.916 --> 12:35.649
Scenario--you pull a car over
for speeding.

12:35.651 --> 12:36.984
You find out
that it's your father.

12:36.986 --> 12:38.753
- How do you handle the situation?
- Ooh.

12:38.755 --> 12:42.088
Well, first,
I would be like,

12:42.158 --> 12:43.674
"Dad...

12:43.676 --> 12:45.843
"You're alive?
What the hell?

12:45.845 --> 12:48.262
Also, do you know
where my catcher's mitt is?"

12:48.264 --> 12:51.165
Shouldn't you be taking her
to lie down somewhere?

12:51.167 --> 12:53.501
Oh, no. If she ever found out
that we took her off camera,

12:53.503 --> 12:54.835
we'd all be fired.

12:54.837 --> 12:57.021
So just, uh, keep taking calls.
You're doing great.

12:57.023 --> 12:58.189
Three, two...

12:58.191 --> 12:59.941
Hello, again.

12:59.943 --> 13:01.192
I'm Ron Swanson,

13:01.194 --> 13:03.227
and I am still taking
your calls--

13:03.229 --> 13:05.096
hopefully,
about tonight's gala.

13:05.098 --> 13:06.447
You're on the air.

13:06.449 --> 13:08.816
Hi, uh, what's wrong
with Joan?

13:08.818 --> 13:10.685
She has a bad hangover,

13:10.687 --> 13:12.987
which she is pretending
is allergies.

13:12.989 --> 13:14.489
Is she gonna be okay?

13:14.491 --> 13:16.974
Wouldn't know--
never been hungover.

13:16.976 --> 13:18.843
After I've had
too much whiskey,

13:18.845 --> 13:20.711
I cook myself
a large flank steak,

13:20.713 --> 13:22.113
pan-fried
in salted butter.

13:22.115 --> 13:23.881
I eat that,
put on a pair of wet socks,

13:23.883 --> 13:24.882
and go to sleep.

13:24.884 --> 13:27.084
- That works?
- It does.

13:27.086 --> 13:29.987
Please call now if you have
questions about tonight's gala

13:29.989 --> 13:32.690
or one of my other
interests--

13:32.692 --> 13:36.025
Woodworking,
uh, novels about tall ships,

13:36.262 --> 13:38.729
meat,
that sort of thing.

13:38.731 --> 13:41.182
I'm afraid
I have some very bad news.

13:41.184 --> 13:45.517
"I, Chris Traeger, after several
sustained hours of diarrhea,

13:45.655 --> 13:48.222
"combined with violent coughing
and a devastating fever,

13:48.224 --> 13:50.724
"followed
by even more diarrhea,

13:50.726 --> 13:52.910
have succumbed
to the avian flu."

13:54.246 --> 13:55.263
I'm dead.

13:55.265 --> 13:56.747
I got to say, Leonard,
it kind of feels

13:56.749 --> 13:58.249
like you're putting us
through the ringer here.

13:58.251 --> 14:00.368
Can you us an idea
how long this is gonna take?

14:00.370 --> 14:01.586
Uh...

14:01.588 --> 14:03.004
Probably
six to eight more hours.

14:03.006 --> 14:05.172
- Eight more hours?
- Nine.

14:05.174 --> 14:06.841
Are all state emergency drills
this intensive?

14:06.843 --> 14:10.094
Oh, no, hardly ever.
Councilman Jamm requested it.

14:10.096 --> 14:11.429
Oh, really?

14:11.431 --> 14:13.214
Specifically asked
that the drill to be done today

14:13.216 --> 14:14.932
and said I should give you
everything I got.

14:14.934 --> 14:16.050
Mmhmm.

14:16.052 --> 14:17.084
Guys! Come here.

14:17.086 --> 14:18.386
The game is rigged.

14:18.388 --> 14:20.187
Jamm invited Leonard here,

14:20.189 --> 14:22.423
and he screwed up the bus thing
on purpose to slow us down.

14:22.425 --> 14:24.609
It is with a heavy heart
that I say,

14:24.611 --> 14:26.444
"We have been jammed."

14:26.446 --> 14:28.262
God, that guy is the worst!

14:28.264 --> 14:31.315
Look, we are stuck in this room
until the drill is over.

14:31.317 --> 14:33.734
What are we gonna do?
The only thing we can do.

14:33.736 --> 14:36.454
In order
to save our park...

14:36.456 --> 14:39.240
We have to destroy
the entire town.

14:40.064 --> 14:41.363
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:41.364 --> 14:43.852
we are making some changes
to the Knope Protocol.

14:43.853 --> 14:46.916
Ann, how much flu vaccine
does the hospital still have?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.086
Enough for 2,000 people.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.788
Great. Why don't you tell
the hospital director

14:50.790 --> 14:52.473
- to flush them down the toilet.
- You got it.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.259
Chief Fugleberg, I want you
to order your officers

14:55.261 --> 14:58.594
to find all the infected birds
in the area and perform CPR.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.464
Sorry.
Won't they become infected?

15:00.466 --> 15:01.682
That's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

15:01.684 --> 15:05.517
Our top priority is now
saving all the birds.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.306
And you know what? Why don't we
just kick this up a notch?

15:08.308 --> 15:11.192
Oh, no!
Pawnee has been hit with...

15:11.494 --> 15:12.693
A tornado quake!

15:13.695 --> 15:15.897
This is Ron.
Go ahead, caller.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.315
Hi.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.318
My Yorkshire Terrier has chewed
up the legs on my kitchen table.

15:20.570 --> 15:22.820
Is there a cheap way
to repair that?

15:22.822 --> 15:24.238
Great question.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.108
Take a walnut and rub it
into the legs of your table.

15:27.110 --> 15:28.542
That'll mask the scratches.

15:28.544 --> 15:30.828
Next thing you want to do
is ditch the Terrier

15:30.830 --> 15:32.580
and get yourself
a proper dog.

15:32.582 --> 15:34.765
Any dog under 50 pounds
is a cat,

15:34.767 --> 15:36.066
and cats are pointless.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.102
Come to the gala.
Next caller.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.437
Grapes of Wrath, chocolate-chip
ice cream, and Johnny Cash.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.425
Don't trust big banks
or small banks.

15:44.427 --> 15:47.061
Banks are Ponzi schemes
run by morons.

15:47.063 --> 15:49.630
Your house isn't haunted.
You're lonely.

15:49.632 --> 15:52.032
Whatever happened to,
"Hey, I have some apples.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.984
Would you like to buy them?"
"Yes, thank you."

15:53.986 --> 15:55.803
That's as complicated
as it should be

15:55.805 --> 15:57.721
to open a business
in this country.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.074
I've seen three movies
in my life--

16:00.076 --> 16:02.276
<i>Bridge on the River Kwai,</i>
<i>Patton,</i>

16:02.278 --> 16:04.595
and <i>Herbie Fully Loaded.</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:06.597
My girlfriend's kids love it.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.566
It's pretty funny.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.601
Next caller.

16:12.770 --> 16:13.671
Good morning.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.873
And... it is a wrap.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.991
Everyone in Pawnee
is dead.

16:17.993 --> 16:19.993
Including
Councilman Jamm.

16:19.995 --> 16:22.796
What?
No, no, you can't do that.

16:22.798 --> 16:23.931
It says right there,
you're dead,

16:23.933 --> 16:25.766
so is everyone
you care about.

16:25.768 --> 16:27.834
Oh, well,
joke's on you.

16:27.836 --> 16:29.803
I don't have anyone
I care about.

16:29.805 --> 16:31.055
Ms. Knope, I'm afraid

16:31.057 --> 16:33.307
I have to once again
give Pawnee a failing grade.

16:33.309 --> 16:36.026
This was bad--
Fort Wayne bad.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.178
Bummer.
Thank you for your time.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.563
I think we're done here.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.283
I will see everyone at the gala,
and I will see you in hell.

16:42.285 --> 16:44.952
Yeah, you're too late, Knope.
That lot is mine.

16:44.954 --> 16:46.570
I can't hear you.
I'm a ghost.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.873
Yeah, well, so am I,
so you can hear me!

16:48.875 --> 16:50.190
Ghost jammed!

16:51.293 --> 16:52.710
We got all the way
to Muncie

16:52.712 --> 16:54.879
before we realized
that it was just a drill.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.698
I mean, all I'm saying is
you could've called.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.416
No one had your cell number, Big "J."

16:59.418 --> 17:00.584
I find that hard to believe.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.886
Oh, my God,
why is everyone standing around?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.537
We have work to do.
Status report.

17:03.539 --> 17:04.805
- Status report!
- Well--

17:04.807 --> 17:06.039
Nope, we don't have time for that.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.374
We're gonna
have to postpone the gala,

17:07.376 --> 17:08.875
but we can't, because
the deadline is tomorrow.

17:08.877 --> 17:10.810
Oh, my God, I destroyed
the entire town for nothing.

17:10.813 --> 17:12.878
Leslie, it's okay.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.099
Oh, my God.
You did all this?

17:19.688 --> 17:21.054
How did you get food?

17:21.056 --> 17:23.607
I had a classic stroke
of Haverford genius.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.742
Who has the most to lose
from a new Paunch Burger?

17:25.744 --> 17:26.877
Their competitors.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.246
I got all the other
fast-food places in town

17:29.248 --> 17:30.731
to donate food.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.899
I know black tie and chicky
tenders isn't the best mix,

17:32.901 --> 17:35.035
- but--
- No, Tom, I love it.

17:35.037 --> 17:38.370
And more importantly, so will
all of our more ample citizens.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.740
How did you
get the word out?

17:39.742 --> 17:42.576
Well, Ron went on Joan's show
and kicked ass.

17:42.578 --> 17:45.212
I also helped a child
perform a tracheotomy

17:45.214 --> 17:46.747
on his elderly uncle.

17:46.749 --> 17:48.682
It's been
a very rewarding day.

17:48.684 --> 17:51.719
Also, I told the firemen they
should use the lot as triage

17:51.721 --> 17:54.271
and then gave them
and all the dead and wounded

17:54.273 --> 17:56.390
- two free drink tickets.
- Wow.

17:56.692 --> 17:59.725
This is great.
Thank you so much.

18:00.562 --> 18:01.779
Let's start the gala.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.114
Oh, and thanks
for dressing up, Jerry.

18:14.744 --> 18:16.210
- Hello, Chief Fugleberg.
- Hey.

18:16.212 --> 18:18.128
That's your buddy Andy Dwyer
over there, isn't it?

18:18.130 --> 18:20.447
 -Such a shame.
- Oh, no.

18:20.449 --> 18:22.616
- Did he fail his test?
- It's weird.

18:22.618 --> 18:24.418
He got 100%
on his written test--

18:24.420 --> 18:25.970
first guy in history
to do it--

18:25.972 --> 18:28.455
but he failed
his personality examination.

18:28.457 --> 18:29.890
He's a sweet kid--

18:29.892 --> 18:31.558
just doesn't have
what it takes to be a cop.

18:31.560 --> 18:32.893
Oh, Andy.

18:32.895 --> 18:35.962
Too bad. He's certainly
something of a genius.

18:35.964 --> 18:38.265
We could use his brains
on the force.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.707
Official police wrist lock.
You can't hit me. Try to hit me.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.771
Or here, no, try--
it's this hand.

18:43.773 --> 18:45.906
Wrist lock. Boom, too much pain,
you can't even hit me.

18:45.908 --> 18:47.307
Try to hit me.

18:47.309 --> 18:49.026
If I had my gun, you wouldn't
try to hit me, though,

18:49.028 --> 18:50.444
is the thing.

18:50.446 --> 18:53.146
Uh, if I could have
everyone's attention please?

18:53.148 --> 18:56.316
I am so happy to announce
that as of one minute ago,

18:56.318 --> 18:58.285
we have reached
our fund-raising goal.

19:01.207 --> 19:04.540
Every dollar spent here tonight
by you, the community,

19:04.844 --> 19:07.327
will be poured right back
into this wonderful project.

19:07.329 --> 19:09.263
And speaking of community,

19:09.265 --> 19:12.332
I'd like to thank my community--
my friends.

19:12.334 --> 19:14.968
It's a lesson that I have
learned over and over again,

19:14.970 --> 19:16.169
but it bears repeating--

19:16.171 --> 19:17.838
No one achieves anything alone.

19:19.775 --> 19:21.975
Without further ado,
the best band in Pawnee--

19:21.977 --> 19:22.976
Mouse Rat.

19:24.780 --> 19:25.846
♪ Park

19:25.848 --> 19:29.181
♪ we will build it,
the park ♪

19:29.452 --> 19:32.403
♪ it's not built yet,
the park ♪

19:32.405 --> 19:35.738
♪ soon there will be a park

19:36.024 --> 19:37.541
Thank you.

19:37.543 --> 19:38.909
♪ Park

19:39.411 --> 19:42.244
I thought you should see
why Leslie tanked the drill.

19:42.548 --> 19:45.365
Councilman Jamm used you
as a stalling tactic,

19:45.367 --> 19:48.700
hoping it would kill
Leslie's park project.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.138
If the test were any other day,
Leslie would have aced it.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.556
I believe you.

19:52.558 --> 19:55.392
Maybe I'll find my way back here
in a month for a re-do.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.094
I appreciate it.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.647
Have you ever thought
of being a sperm donor?

20:00.649 --> 20:01.849
I'm impotent.

20:01.851 --> 20:03.049
Yeah, I don't need
to know that.

20:03.051 --> 20:05.652
This is
the best wedding present ever.

20:05.654 --> 20:07.071
This is
the best night ever.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.188
I wish we were getting married
tonight.

20:08.190 --> 20:09.907
Well, we only have
three more months.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.742
I can't wait
three more months.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.578
God, I just hate the feeling
of not being married to you.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.664
Well...

20:18.466 --> 20:20.999
Let's just do it, then.

20:21.670 --> 20:24.505
Let's get married...
Here, tonight.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.590
I mean,
we're all in black tie.

20:26.592 --> 20:29.925
We've got plenty of food
and entertainment...

20:30.379 --> 20:32.262
And you did want to invite
the whole town

20:32.264 --> 20:34.047
to the wedding, right?

20:34.049 --> 20:37.382
Leslie...

20:37.636 --> 20:40.253
Let's get married...
Tonight.

20:43.455 --> 20:45.423
_

20:46.589 --> 20:48.269
Breaking news--
I've just been handed this.

20:48.807 --> 20:51.258
Pawnee has been hit
by a devastating earthquake.

20:51.309 --> 20:53.377
We go to our reporter, live,

20:53.395 --> 20:56.013
Winnifred Makepiece,
for the story. Winnifred?

20:56.047 --> 20:58.983
Thanks, Jessica. I'm here
at the Pawnee Weather Center

20:59.017 --> 21:01.218
with celebrated geologist
Isabella Winchester.

21:01.236 --> 21:03.554
Isabella, can you tell us more
about this killer earthquake?

21:03.572 --> 21:04.905
That's right, Winnifred,

21:04.940 --> 21:07.458
the earthquake registered
an 8.5 on the Richter scale.

21:07.492 --> 21:09.059
That's correct.
It was a large one.

21:09.077 --> 21:10.845
Thank you so much,
everyone.

21:10.879 --> 21:13.164
From all of us here
at Channel 4 News,

21:13.198 --> 21:14.749
I'm Jessica Rabrit.

21:14.783 --> 21:17.868
Have a good evening
and be safe out there.
