00:25.112 --> 00:27.549
Previously on
Star Strange New Worlds...

00:27.592 --> 00:29.116
Send someone else.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.595
You don't want me
in command of that ship.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.206
-You saw the future.
-I saw my own death.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.816
Your first officer doesn't do

00:33.859 --> 00:34.947
down time well, Chris.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.427
-Captain.
-Samuel Kirk.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.603
Well, you're posted
to life sciences, and

00:38.647 --> 00:39.952
he's your new boss.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.606
Captain Pike.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.739
Lieutenant La'An Noonien-Singh.
Chief of Security.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.220
Ah, the prodigy. Cadet Uhura?

00:46.263 --> 00:48.483
-What's the mission?
-We explore.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.093
We seek out new life

00:50.137 --> 00:51.660
and new civilizations.

00:51.703 --> 00:55.098
We boldly go where no one
has gone before.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.906
Cadet's log.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.518
Stardate 2912.4.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.476
TheEnterprise is surveying
the Persephone system,

01:25.520 --> 01:27.478
where the crew
is studying the behavior

01:27.522 --> 01:31.091
of an ancient comet,
C/2260-Quentin.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.484
I, however, am doing rotation

01:33.528 --> 01:35.399
in landing party
readiness protocols,

01:35.443 --> 01:37.575
which doesn't really
involve comets,

01:37.619 --> 01:39.186
ancient or otherwise,

01:39.229 --> 01:41.144
so duties are pretty slow
at the moment.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.191
Except, of course, for a recent
invitation to dinner

01:44.234 --> 01:46.758
at the captain's cabin,
for which I have been encouraged

01:46.802 --> 01:48.369
by Lieutenant Ortegas

01:48.412 --> 01:50.762
to dust off my dress uniform.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.377
You said it was formal.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.161
Actually, what I said was you...

01:58.205 --> 01:59.945
might want to wear
your dress uniform.

01:59.989 --> 02:03.210
Are you kidding? This is
your idea of a practical joke?

02:03.253 --> 02:05.212
Kind of.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.214
I'm going back to change.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.433
You do not want to be late
to the captain's table.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.960
Relax, Cadet. It's tradition.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.049
-Hazing the newbie?
-All in good fun.

02:17.093 --> 02:19.313
We get bored. It's a small ship.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.836
You know, it's really not.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.925
Come on.

02:22.968 --> 02:25.841
Consider it your
first complete square

02:25.884 --> 02:27.364
in Enterprisebingo.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.670
You know about that?

02:28.713 --> 02:31.586
I was a cadet once too, Cadet.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.457
So, what are these things like?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.894
Well, first off, they're
not just the command crew.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.114
Captain wants, you know,
regular people,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.985
to hear what's actually
happening on the ship,

02:40.029 --> 02:42.553
so he'll probably
ask you questions.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.425
Great.

02:45.774 --> 02:46.949
That a problem?

02:46.992 --> 02:48.516
How do I put this?

02:48.559 --> 02:51.649
My father liked to say
that I was unburdened

02:51.693 --> 02:54.783
by conversational boundaries.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.437
So, this'll be fun
for you, then.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.185
Lieutenant Ortegas,
Cadet Uhura, wel--

03:06.577 --> 03:08.927
Dress uniform, huh?
Grab a drink.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.842
I got to deal with the ribs.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.148
Ortegas,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.585
come help refill drinks.
Cadet Uhura,

03:14.629 --> 03:16.457
-good to see you.
-You, too.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.383
Oh, uh, can I help?

03:31.907 --> 03:33.430
No.

03:33.474 --> 03:36.651
You have offended Hemmer,
our new Chief Engineer.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.783
No offense intended.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.611
I was raised
to offer help to anyone

03:40.655 --> 03:42.134
with a sensory impairment.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.353
-If I was...
-That word again.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.354
Sir?

03:44.398 --> 03:46.269
"Impaired."

03:46.313 --> 03:49.490
A human in my condition might
consider themselves impaired.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.014
Hemmer may not be able to see,
but his other senses compensate.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.668
Compensate?

03:53.711 --> 03:55.670
They are superior.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.281
Uh, I've read that,
among many things,

03:58.325 --> 04:00.501
the Aenar have a form
of precognitive ability.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.199
I knew you were
going to ask that.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.549
Because you sensed my question
before I asked it?

04:05.593 --> 04:07.290
Because everyone
always asks that.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.813
Right.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.341
You telegraphed your throw,
telepathically.

04:14.384 --> 04:17.474
As was my intention,
to illustrate.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.740
This is a hazing thing,
isn't it?

04:22.784 --> 04:24.525
You guys are screwing around.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.837
I think I need a drink.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.015
I like her.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.365
Indeed.

04:38.408 --> 04:41.542
So, I have my phaser out,
and, sure enough,

04:41.585 --> 04:43.544
down the street, there's
the Nausicaan we're after.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.633
Running away, no pants on.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.942
I move after him, only I trip,
flat on my face. I shout,

04:50.986 --> 04:53.336
"Freeze!" But the Nausicaan
keeps running.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.253
I try to stand up, but my feet
are caught on something,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.037
and then I realize...

04:59.081 --> 05:01.301
-I've tripped on his pants.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.651
So, anyway,

05:03.694 --> 05:06.349
after, my lieutenant
pulls me aside and says,

05:06.393 --> 05:09.396
"Maybe Security isn't
the best fit for you, Ensign."

05:13.182 --> 05:15.924
I've never understood
the human inclination

05:15.967 --> 05:18.492
to laugh at others' misfortune.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.363
It feels... impolite.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.539
That's why it's funny.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.150
Because it breaks
a social expectation?

05:25.194 --> 05:26.630
Sometimes, Mr. Spock,

05:26.674 --> 05:29.764
things go so badly
you just have to laugh.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.210
What's that you're humming,
Cadet?

05:41.253 --> 05:44.648
Sorry. Bad habit.

05:46.694 --> 05:50.393
Uh, it's an old folk song
from my village in Kenya.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.614
I've visited Lake Simbi Nyaima
several times.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.833
It is achingly beautiful there.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.923
-I grew up just
a few miles away.
-Really?

05:58.967 --> 06:00.360
You know, the Enterprise
only gets a handful

06:00.403 --> 06:02.100
of cadets a year from Starfleet.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.580
You got to be pretty impressive
to make the cut.

06:03.624 --> 06:04.668
Thank you, sir.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.714
I hear you speak 12 languages.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.933
Uh, 37.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.197
Okay, wow.

06:12.241 --> 06:16.419
Uh, in Kenya we have
22 native languages.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.595
I found early that,
if I wanted to be understood,

06:18.639 --> 06:20.597
it's best to communicate
in someone's own tongue,

06:20.641 --> 06:23.470
so I learned them.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.472
Easy as that?

06:25.515 --> 06:27.604
For me, sir, yes.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.824
I noticed you're on the next
landing party rotation.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.260
I know it can be confusing

06:31.303 --> 06:32.740
jumping from department
to department.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.220
-Right, Number One?
-That was one time.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.615
I'm sure you've chosen
a specialty you'd like.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.704
Where do you see
yourself in ten y--

06:41.705 --> 06:44.534
Ten years,
where do you see yourself?

06:44.578 --> 06:46.710
Are you asking me what I want

06:46.754 --> 06:48.625
to be when I grow up, Captain?

06:50.714 --> 06:52.455
Sure.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.457
I...

06:56.111 --> 06:58.766
...guess the truth is,
I'm not sure

06:58.809 --> 07:01.333
I'm actually
all that "Starfleet."

07:05.903 --> 07:08.428
That's not something
I've ever heard from a cadet.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.952
You worked pretty hard
to get here.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.345
You beat out, how many,
a thousand applicants?

07:13.389 --> 07:15.086
Several thousand.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.698
And now you're not sure
if you want to be here?

07:17.741 --> 07:20.135
I always wanted to study
alien languages.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.180
I have an ear for them.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.269
And a gift for understatement.

07:24.313 --> 07:27.142
I was going to attend
the University in Nairobi.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.361
Both my parents taught there.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.798
Mm-hmm.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.800
About a week before
I was due to start,

07:32.843 --> 07:35.150
they were, uh...

07:35.193 --> 07:37.500
killed in a shuttle accident.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.371
My older brother, too.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.853
I'm so sorry.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.856
After, I just...

07:45.900 --> 07:48.293
couldn't go to campus.

07:48.337 --> 07:51.122
Their absence was...

07:51.166 --> 07:52.994
everywhere.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.952
I moved in with my grandmother,

07:54.996 --> 07:57.607
but I just...

07:57.651 --> 07:59.391
didn't feel like I fit

07:59.435 --> 08:01.568
anywhere.

08:01.611 --> 08:04.832
Anyway, she was in Starfleet
when she was young,

08:04.875 --> 08:06.703
and she always
used to talk about it,

08:06.747 --> 08:08.923
and, well, I didn't know
what else to do.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.578
So you ran away to Starfleet?

08:11.621 --> 08:14.015
Yes.

08:15.103 --> 08:18.498
That is an impressive
and heartbreaking story, Cadet.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.631
That's me.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.155
Well, Cadet,
I appreciate your honesty,

08:24.199 --> 08:26.331
and I sincerely hope
you discover a place

08:26.375 --> 08:27.855
where you feel you do fit,

08:27.898 --> 08:30.684
wherever that may be.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.345
Guess I kind of blew it
in there, huh?

08:40.389 --> 08:42.217
Not at all, Cadet.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.959
The captain values honesty,
as do I.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.570
But...?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.659
But I would say to you

08:49.703 --> 08:52.444
that Starfleet has been
a lifelong dream for many,

08:52.488 --> 08:54.621
myself included.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.580
If it is not your path,
you might consider making way

08:57.624 --> 09:00.061
for someone else
who wants to walk it.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.244
I've seen you ask that cadet

09:09.287 --> 09:11.551
question a hundred times.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.030
Tonight it felt different.

09:13.074 --> 09:16.338
Is it because
of what you told me,

09:16.381 --> 09:18.949
about what you saw on Boreth?

09:18.993 --> 09:21.125
Turns out, knowing your future

09:21.169 --> 09:23.606
kind of takes the fun
out of imagining it.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.087
Chris, have you
considered that maybe

09:26.130 --> 09:28.350
your fate isn't written?

09:28.393 --> 09:30.657
Dusty Swender.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.050
T'quiel Dawn. Muliq Al Alcazar.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.575
Yuuto Hoshide. Andrea Lopez.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.273
I could keep going. These are
the kids I save when it happens.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.232
You know their names.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.237
Lately, I've been saying them
over and over again,

09:46.281 --> 09:47.761
like a reminder.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.198
Stay the course,
save their lives.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.637
I refuse to believe
there isn't another way.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.075
SPOCK
Captain Pike to the bridge.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.990
There is a problem
with the comet.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.874
The computer simulation
suggests that,

10:13.917 --> 10:16.441
when the comet strikes
the planet in two days,

10:16.485 --> 10:19.706
there will be no survivors.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.664
Persephone III
is an M-Class world.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.449
Previous surveys suggests
it is home to an intelligent,

10:24.493 --> 10:26.930
pre-warp species that
call themselves the Deleb.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.631
Given their current state
of technological advancement,

10:31.674 --> 10:33.154
it is highly unlikely
that they're aware

10:33.197 --> 10:34.677
-of the danger they are in.
-Options?

10:34.721 --> 10:38.246
The Deleb can't move the comet,

10:38.289 --> 10:40.814
-so we move it for them?
-Mr. Spock?

10:40.857 --> 10:44.034
An ion engine.
To be precise, four,

10:44.078 --> 10:45.340
programmed to fire in sequence

10:45.383 --> 10:46.558
to account
for the comet's rotation.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.822
Got it. Number One, thoughts?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.519
It could work.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.870
We could use photon torpedoes
as launch vehicles.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.046
Take about an hour
for the retrofit.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.961
A rosy assessment,
considering I'll be the one

10:58.005 --> 10:59.702
doing the retrofitting.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.138
Let's get it done, people.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.836
We've got a planet to save
before breakfast.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.403
I love this job.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.248
Anyone want to tell me
how a comet

11:24.292 --> 11:26.642
puts up a force field?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.823
Space.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.261
The final frontier.

11:39.220 --> 11:43.006
These are the voyages
of the starshipEnterprise.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.793
Its five-year mission:

11:46.836 --> 11:50.057
to explore strange new worlds...

11:52.015 --> 11:54.539
...to seek out new life

11:54.583 --> 11:58.152
and new civilizations,

11:58.195 --> 12:02.243
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.367
We've tried every hail,
every scan you can think of.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.196
If there's life on the comet,
we can't find it.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.329
But we did find...

13:28.372 --> 13:29.852
a structure.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.986
It's enormous
and mostly subterranean.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.205
A structure suggests
alien intelligence.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.338
Which is why I've asked Sam Kirk
of Xenoanthropology here

13:37.381 --> 13:39.557
to join us. So, let's start
with the obvious.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.299
It looks like a comet,
has shields like a starship,

13:42.343 --> 13:44.649
and a building on its surface
like a planet,

13:44.693 --> 13:45.999
but no life signs.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.739
Maybe it's not a comet at all,

13:47.783 --> 13:51.439
but some kind of
derelict spacecraft?

13:51.482 --> 13:53.702
Okay, so how do we
shut down its shields?

13:53.745 --> 13:56.313
Logic suggests this structure is
likely where we'll have to go.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.881
Except it's got shields.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.187
The shields are not constant.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.102
They only appear
in response to a threat.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.581
It should be possible
to beam to the surface

14:03.625 --> 14:04.974
without triggering them.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.063
Sam, are you aware
of any civilization

14:07.107 --> 14:08.543
that developed
on the surface of a comet?

14:08.586 --> 14:10.806
First I've heard of one.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.853
I'm starting
to like the mustache.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.334
Maybe you should
try one for yourself.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.597
La'An, you, Spock,

14:19.641 --> 14:21.556
and Sam get suited up, and

14:21.599 --> 14:23.427
this is the cadet's
first away mission.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.908
You wanted to learn
to speak alien languages...

14:25.952 --> 14:28.563
go where the aliens are.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.480
The surface of the comet
is bombarded

14:32.523 --> 14:35.744
by ridiculously high levels
of cosmic rays.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.398
This will buy you two hours.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.617
Any more and your insides
will turn to liquid.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.794
Ow!

14:42.838 --> 14:44.927
Ugh, you could've warned me.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.711
Then you'd know
it was gonna hurt.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.104
You know I've had people
run on me?

14:55.329 --> 14:57.679
Weapon up, people.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.985
Kirk, Uhura,

14:59.028 --> 15:00.595
when you're recovered, with me.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.120
You ready for this?

15:04.164 --> 15:05.817
I am more than capable
of managing

15:05.861 --> 15:07.036
any pain you can induce.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.864
Mr. Spock.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.475
Now you're just toying with me.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.348
That was not my intention.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.959
-I've noticed.
-Heads up.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.743
Thank you, Lieutenant.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.248
LA'
Remember, when we arrive,

15:45.292 --> 15:47.555
gravity is a fraction
of Earth normal.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.558
Don't want anyone
flying off into space.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.912
Energize, Mr. Kyle.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.766
-You good?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.986
Yeah.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.640
I'm... standing
on the surface of a comet.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.168
Curious.
According to my readings,

17:19.212 --> 17:22.737
there is breathable atmosphere
inside the chamber.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.347
We should make sure it's secure.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.088
Lieutenant Spock,
you scan the room.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.916
I'll do a perimeter sweep.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.881
These markings.

17:36.925 --> 17:40.059
What do you think,
decorative or linguistic?

17:41.886 --> 17:43.540
You're asking me?

17:43.584 --> 17:45.803
Don't study linguistics
if you don't want people

17:45.847 --> 17:47.196
to ask you questions about it.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.285
Okay.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.679
Fine.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.376
It's just, uh...

17:53.420 --> 17:57.032
You're a cadet, it's your
first away mission, I get it.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.600
But you're here for a reason.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.917
These markings,

18:12.961 --> 18:14.919
they repeat in a sequence.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.879
A sequence, huh? Maybe a code?

18:17.922 --> 18:20.360
I don't know.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.796
Just...

18:21.839 --> 18:25.626
Everything seems
to point to this egg.

18:25.669 --> 18:29.412
It's important, just--
I don't know how.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.459
Do you think these markings
indicate some kind of control?

18:34.287 --> 18:36.158
If they do,

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
then perhaps this is how we can
affect the comet's shields.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.161
LA'
Perimeter's clear.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.468
No one here but us.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.433
Uh, Lieutenant,
I don't think that's a...

18:52.653 --> 18:54.872
...a good idea.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.961
Yahtzee.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.007
Huh?

18:59.050 --> 19:00.748
It's an old Earth game.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.272
I am familiar
with Yahtzee, Lieutenant,

19:03.316 --> 19:05.579
but I am reading a dangerous
buildup of energy.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.624
Please step away from the egg.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.672
Turn him over.
Get his helmet off.

19:20.376 --> 19:23.162
His heart has stopped.
We need to get him to the ship.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.729
LA'AN
Ent... prise.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.036
We ne... ergency beam out.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.908
La'An, your signal's spotty.
We can't quite hear you.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.955
Lieutenant Kirk has been
injured. Beam us out.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.914
Having trouble getting a lock.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.314
Clear.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.539
Energizing.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.891
Captain, the force field.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.980
It's back up.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.550
Signal's being blocked.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.161
I can't get them back.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.554
Clear.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.390
He's stable, for now.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.653
All frequencies are down.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.785
We're cut off from the ship.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.876
We're on our own.

20:38.019 --> 20:41.152
He sustained massive trauma
from electrical shock.

20:41.196 --> 20:42.632
I've sedated him.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.069
Uh, maybe we don't touch
anything else.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.900
Just a suggestion.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.512
He will not survive without
prompt medical attention.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.516
Seems that force field is back.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.866
It appears the comet wishes
to keep us here.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.172
What kind of comet
knows someone's walking on it?

21:01.216 --> 21:02.652
A salient question, Cadet.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.306
One that I am afraid
you may have to answer

21:04.350 --> 21:06.047
in order for us to escape.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.919
Sir, I'm reminding you
this is my first away mission.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.181
That may be,

21:10.225 --> 21:11.705
but the key to our escape

21:11.748 --> 21:13.402
may well be in these markings
all around us,

21:13.446 --> 21:15.578
and you are the only
linguistics expert here.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.926
Right now, I need ideas.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.144
We've got a planet
full of people

22:00.188 --> 22:01.711
who will die without our help,

22:01.755 --> 22:04.018
and our crew members
are trapped on that comet.

22:04.061 --> 22:06.325
We need to get through
that force field. How?

22:08.022 --> 22:09.763
Phaser harmonics?

22:11.634 --> 22:13.723
A phaser at a higher frequency
could cause resonance.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.030
The right frequency
could shatter it.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.601
I like this plan. This is a good
plan. Ortegas, bring us around.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.225
How are we doing, Cadet?

22:37.268 --> 22:39.183
At the moment,

22:39.227 --> 22:41.795
pretending not to be in
way over my head.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.581
Too honest?

22:45.625 --> 22:48.758
I am a Vulcan.
We are "too honest" by nature.

22:48.802 --> 22:52.066
Your girlfriend
must love that, huh?

22:53.459 --> 22:54.895
Nurse Chapel.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.071
Nurse Chapel
is not my girlfriend.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.116
I know,

22:59.160 --> 23:01.249
but she was flirting with you.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.211
It was a joke. You know, to...

23:07.255 --> 23:10.171
break the tension.

23:10.214 --> 23:13.348
Do you not think this is
an inappropriate time for jokes?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.525
It's like the captain said.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.833
"Sometimes things go so badly

23:19.876 --> 23:22.531
you just have to laugh."

23:24.054 --> 23:26.013
I find the best way
to diffuse tension

23:26.056 --> 23:28.102
is to apply rigorous logic.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.061
Okay.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.150
That's always an option, too.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.907
Phasers locked
and ready, Captain.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.692
On your command, Number One.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.219
-Incoming weapons fire.
-Damage report?

23:58.262 --> 24:01.875
Minimal damage to port nacelle.
Shields holding at 70%.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.790
Who hit us?

24:06.706 --> 24:08.882
Uh, they did.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.550
Hail them. On screen.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.861
This is Captain Christopher Pike
of the Federation

24:31.905 --> 24:33.515
starship Enterprise.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.951
Who are you and why are you
attacking our vessel?

24:34.995 --> 24:37.040
We are the Shepherds.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.478
Really?

24:39.521 --> 24:40.479
That's how
the universal translator

24:40.522 --> 24:41.610
is processing it.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.136
We escortM'hanit.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.138
The comet?

24:48.182 --> 24:50.967
M'hanit is far more
than a comet.

24:51.011 --> 24:55.450
M'hanit is one of
the ancient arbiters of life.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.321
Okay.

24:57.365 --> 24:58.975
If you tamper with it again,

24:59.019 --> 25:02.718
we will not hesitate
to destroy you.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.208
Scan the ship.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.514
What kind of weapons
are we dealing with?

25:17.994 --> 25:20.693
Our intentions were not hostile.

25:20.736 --> 25:24.087
M'hanitis on a collision
course with an inhabited planet.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.481
We were simply trying
to divert its trajectory.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.135
Absurd.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.093
Would you adjust
the height of the waves

25:30.137 --> 25:32.226
or the position of the stars?

25:32.269 --> 25:35.838
M'hanit's course is preordained.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.058
There are millions of people
on that planet.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.713
The impact will kill them all
and likely blow your comet--

25:40.756 --> 25:42.715
Uh...

25:42.758 --> 25:46.632
Blow your M'hanit
into just as many pieces.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.983
Are you a reasonable man,
Captain?

25:50.026 --> 25:51.898
I-I'd like to think so, yes.

25:51.941 --> 25:54.248
Then please entertain
the proposition

25:54.291 --> 25:56.119
thatM'hanit is not,

25:56.163 --> 25:58.252
as you continue to call him,

25:58.295 --> 25:59.993
a comet.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.604
It is an instrument,

26:02.648 --> 26:04.606
an ancient arbiter,

26:04.650 --> 26:07.609
one of the few remaining
in the galaxy.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.178
If it is his will to move,
he will move.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.397
If it is his will to bring life,

26:13.441 --> 26:15.486
he will bring life.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.227
IfM'hanit wills

26:17.271 --> 26:20.622
the planet to die,
even chooses to die with it,

26:20.666 --> 26:23.451
then that is what will happen.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.367
As I said, it is preordained.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.674
Blowing up a planet full
of people is not preordained...

26:28.717 --> 26:31.764
You said you were
a reasonable man, Captain.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.767
So how can you know?
Since before

26:34.810 --> 26:37.683
our distant ancestors touched
the sky and the stars beyond,

26:37.726 --> 26:39.946
my people have been charged

26:39.989 --> 26:42.165
with the protection
of the arbiters.

26:42.209 --> 26:45.647
None of us even remember when
the charge first came to us,

26:45.691 --> 26:47.649
but we accepted the mantle

26:47.693 --> 26:49.782
with honor.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.653
For centuries,

26:51.697 --> 26:54.569
we have protected the arbiters
as they follow courses

26:54.613 --> 26:56.615
set long before our suns

26:56.658 --> 26:58.660
first burned in the sky,

26:58.704 --> 27:01.315
bringing life across the galaxy.

27:01.358 --> 27:04.927
It is not our prerogative
to interfere, Captain,

27:04.971 --> 27:06.668
nor is it yours.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.148
Please, excuse me.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.932
Pause communications.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.760
Shepherds?

27:11.804 --> 27:13.719
Zealots is more like it.
What did you find?

27:13.762 --> 27:15.372
Their systems are
incredibly advanced,

27:15.416 --> 27:16.896
their ships faster than ours,

27:16.939 --> 27:18.637
and their weapon systems...

27:18.680 --> 27:20.377
Let's just say we don't
want to piss them off.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.816
How exactly are we
supposed to move the comet

27:23.859 --> 27:25.339
without doing that?

27:25.382 --> 27:26.732
We have to buy time
for the landing party

27:26.775 --> 27:28.559
to get the force field down.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.604
And hope these Shepherds
don't find out

27:29.648 --> 27:31.214
that they're down there.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.564
I'm guessing they'd be
kind of touchy about that.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.262
Ensign, resume communications.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.615
You have your sacred duty.
We have ours.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.531
The Federation doesn't interfere
in the development of species,

27:43.574 --> 27:45.533
but we also don't just
let them die.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.710
We don't mean
to disrespect M'hanit.

27:48.754 --> 27:51.147
We'd do the same for you
if you were in danger.

27:51.191 --> 27:54.890
You say you don't interfere,
that you mean no disrespect,

27:54.934 --> 27:58.546
but your crew has desecrated
the temple on his surface.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.027
Guess they know
about the landing party.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.684
-We were simply
trying to ascer...
-Their presence

28:05.727 --> 28:07.250
is blasphemy.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.992
M'hanit will be their tomb.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.821
Any further action
to rescue them

28:12.865 --> 28:15.345
will be considered
an act of war.

28:16.912 --> 28:19.175
Find a way to get through
to the landing party right now.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.786
Break the laws of physics
if you have to.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.931
How is he?

28:35.975 --> 28:39.065
Stable, and holding.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.936
What about you, Cadet?

28:40.980 --> 28:44.070
You gonna get us out of here,
or get us killed?

28:45.985 --> 28:49.075
Right now, I'd say
it's pretty much a toss-up.

28:56.996 --> 29:00.303
Your humming suggests you
may be experiencing distress.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.870
May I remind you
that circumstances

29:01.914 --> 29:03.959
are less dire than they were.

29:04.003 --> 29:06.919
Mr. Kirk identified
one error you can avoid.

29:06.962 --> 29:10.444
By eliminating that option,
he has improved your odds.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.492
Was that actually
your version of a pep talk?

29:15.536 --> 29:18.365
Yes. I've been working on them.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.889
How was it, would you say?

29:20.933 --> 29:24.980
Maybe don't take your foot
off the gas on that one.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.895
Well, you are achieving
your stated objective

29:26.939 --> 29:28.810
of studying alien languages.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.073
Like you said, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.727
That's not precisely...

29:32.771 --> 29:34.250
You all should be relying
on someone who's prepared.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.470
Someone actually Starfleet,

29:36.513 --> 29:39.255
not someone who's gonna
get us all fried to a crisp.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.349
As this is your
first away mission,

29:46.393 --> 29:48.221
may I assume it is also
the first time

29:48.264 --> 29:49.439
your life has been in danger?

29:49.483 --> 29:51.833
Yes.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.356
Kind of.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.752
No, just yes.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.536
Confrontations
with our mortality

29:59.580 --> 30:03.323
often cause us to see ourselves
as if from the outside.

30:03.366 --> 30:06.369
Such a perspective can be
a unique opportunity.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.765
You did not intend
on being here,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.375
but you are here.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.421
Hypotheticals are irrelevant.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.510
Today, you are, quite simply,

30:16.553 --> 30:18.729
the only person for the job.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.210
Will you rise to see it through?

30:24.083 --> 30:26.781
That one was better.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.261
Your pep talk, I mean.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.278
Cadet.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.760
The cave seems to be reacting
to your voice.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.607
Music.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.306
It responds to music.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.835
Anything?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.706
Nothing from the landing party,

31:22.750 --> 31:24.578
but I found a possible signal
coming from the comet itself.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.580
What kind of signal?

31:36.807 --> 31:39.158
Computer, identify this song.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.943
"Vamuvamba," a traditional song
from Earth,

31:41.987 --> 31:44.032
originating in Kenya.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.906
That cannot be a coincidence.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.968
Different pitches
elicit different responses.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.492
What's the light show?
Is it good?

32:09.536 --> 32:12.582
The comet's systems seem
to be controlled by music.

32:12.626 --> 32:15.803
Lieutenant Kirk thought
these symbols were a code.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.023
Music is just sound waves,

32:18.066 --> 32:20.242
which can be represented
by numbers.

32:20.286 --> 32:22.288
What if the code is harmonics?

32:22.331 --> 32:25.944
Someone help me out here.
I skipped music class.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.250
Harmonics are just the ratios
between frequencies.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.818
Every note vibrates
at a specific frequency.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.254
Double that frequency,

32:32.298 --> 32:33.995
and you get the same pitch
an octave higher.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.695
That's the two in our code.

32:38.739 --> 32:41.002
Triple the frequency,
and you get a perfect fifth.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.439
Five times the frequency
is a major third.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.966
The code is a major chord.

32:48.009 --> 32:51.012
Why would an alien species
write music the way we do?

32:51.056 --> 32:53.841
Musical notes are
easily derived from math.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.799
Vulcans theorize it is
their fundamental nature

32:55.843 --> 32:57.062
which makes them
pleasing to the ear.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.241
Someone match my pitch.

33:04.678 --> 33:08.073
Oh... no help here.
I'll break the thing.

33:25.612 --> 33:29.050
Okay, try and follow my lead.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.718
We're definitely getting closer
to resolving the whole genius

34:28.762 --> 34:30.459
or "about to get us
killed" conundrum.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.375
So the right time for genius.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.831
If we are correct
and the comet communicates

34:54.875 --> 34:56.833
through music,
it would be logical to assume

34:56.877 --> 34:58.705
that it is speaking to us
right now.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.533
Okay.

35:00.576 --> 35:04.058
So, how do we convince it
to lower the force field?

35:13.154 --> 35:15.765
Hold on. Let me try something.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.830
The comet's force field
just disappeared.

35:36.873 --> 35:40.138
Bridge to Transporter Room,
energize.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.617
We've got them.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.016
Shields up. Red alert.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.499
Captain,

35:53.542 --> 35:55.196
Shepherds are hailing us.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.026
Open a channel. On screen.

35:59.069 --> 36:02.812
You continue to interfere.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.771
Well, technically...

36:04.814 --> 36:06.729
-You were warned.
-Look,
let's talk about this.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.557
Find some common ground.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.432
I think that went well.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.044
They're launching torpedoes,
Captain.

36:17.087 --> 36:19.525
-I'm reading three inbound.
-We definitely pissed them off.

36:23.485 --> 36:24.834
Brace for impact.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.628
Shields at 50%.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.891
-Ortegas, evasive maneuvers.
-On it.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.513
-They are pursuing.
-Return fire?

36:51.557 --> 36:52.688
Negative.
Escape pattern April-Omega 3.

36:52.732 --> 36:55.256
Captain, recommend we withdraw.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.518
-We're already on the run.
-LA'We need

36:56.562 --> 36:57.650
to warp out and regroup.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.652
Facing off with them is suicide.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.219
-We're outgunned here.
-She's right.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.221
Their ship is too advanced
for us to take on.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.701
-Shields at 40%.
-Sir,

37:05.745 --> 37:07.529
when we were on the surface,
I believe the comet

37:07.573 --> 37:09.270
-was trying
to communicate with us.
-Right.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.707
The music you recorded. Any idea
what it was trying to say?

37:11.751 --> 37:14.057
I haven't been able to translate
it yet. It might take days.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.450
We have less than one hour
before the comet

37:15.494 --> 37:17.060
will impact Persephone III.

37:17.104 --> 37:19.411
You do a lot of reminding people
of deadlines, sir.

37:19.454 --> 37:22.196
-She does have a point, Spock.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.155
Captain, unless we want them
to blow us out of the sky...

37:25.199 --> 37:26.853
Give me phasers.
Target their weapons

37:26.896 --> 37:28.681
and propulsion systems.
We don't want to hurt them.

37:28.724 --> 37:32.119
-Wish they felt the same.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.817
-Shields at 25%. Phasers locked.
-Ortegas,

37:34.861 --> 37:37.080
bring us around
to bearing 150 mark nine.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.604
Aye, sir.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.170
And...

37:40.214 --> 37:41.607
fire.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.221
Direct hit.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.701
They're pulling away to regroup.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.659
I'd say we have
less than a minute.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.444
We have to save that planet.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.881
We brought down the force field,
so how do we move the comet?

37:54.924 --> 37:56.099
Let's face it,
the crazy space monks

37:56.143 --> 37:57.492
will blow us out of the sky

37:57.536 --> 37:59.494
if we try anything
to move that comet.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.106
What if we didn't?

38:04.804 --> 38:07.285
What if the comet moved itself?

38:14.857 --> 38:16.903
Everyone ready?

38:17.904 --> 38:20.080
We only get one shot at this.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.649
Maximum impulse.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.304
They're gaining on us.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.088
When they get close enough,
they'll take a kill shot.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.742
Ortegas,

38:29.785 --> 38:31.309
you know how you used to brag
you were going to be

38:31.352 --> 38:32.875
the best pilot ever to graduate
the Academy?

38:34.877 --> 38:36.531
Word gets around.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.404
What's your point, sir?

38:39.447 --> 38:40.883
Time to prove it, Lieutenant.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.798
Get us in front of that comet.

38:43.799 --> 38:47.803
Initiating evasive pattern
Ortegas-gamma-one.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.631
Evasive pattern Ortegas...?

39:12.437 --> 39:13.873
Shepherds are in pursuit.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.989
They've stopped firing.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.382
They don't want to hit
the comet.

39:46.296 --> 39:49.430
I think they're hailing us.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.389
Yeah, they are. Captain?

39:51.432 --> 39:52.781
Not yet.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.371
Ortegas, time to come about.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.592
Rerouting
to bearing 180 mark five.

40:20.635 --> 40:21.854
Reverse thrusters, full stop.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.509
Reversing thrusters. And...

40:25.510 --> 40:27.250
Stopped.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.383
Ops, shut down all systems
except for life support.

40:33.256 --> 40:36.346
All right, Ensign Christina.
I'm ready for the Shepherds now.

40:36.390 --> 40:38.087
On screen, please.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.618
We surrender.
The damage we've sustained

40:46.661 --> 40:48.489
has caused
complete systems failure.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.710
And what if we choose
not to accept your surrender?

40:51.753 --> 40:54.495
Well, if you don't help us,

40:54.539 --> 40:57.237
we'll collide with the comet,
which will destroy our ship.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.240
And the trilithium resin
in our warp core will ignite,

41:00.283 --> 41:02.068
destroying the comet.

41:02.111 --> 41:05.158
Which will also happen
if you try to blow us up.

41:07.856 --> 41:10.511
Please, help us.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.252
I give you my word,

41:12.295 --> 41:15.603
we will not touch M'hanitagain.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.959
You're taking a big gamble.

41:24.003 --> 41:26.266
I recognize that, Number One.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.014
The Shepherd ship
is activating a tractor beam.

41:37.016 --> 41:40.062
Mr. Spock? You're up.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.154
Acknowledged, Captain.

42:12.399 --> 42:14.270
Approaching the nucleus
of the comet.

42:14.314 --> 42:17.752
And diverting power
through the shuttle's shields.

42:21.190 --> 42:24.803
Shields radiating heat
at maximum intensity.

42:28.197 --> 42:31.244
The surface
appears to be responding.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.391
Maintaining position.

42:48.435 --> 42:50.393
Preparing to engage
heat shields.

43:40.139 --> 43:42.141
It's moving.

43:43.098 --> 43:45.405
The sublimation
is nudging the comet off course.

43:45.448 --> 43:48.626
And for the record,
we're not actually touching it.

43:53.413 --> 43:55.633
But where's Lieutenant Spock?

44:01.421 --> 44:04.206
Spock? Is everything okay?

44:04.250 --> 44:06.469
Fine, Captain. Sometimes things

44:06.513 --> 44:09.124
go so badly,
you just have to laugh.

44:35.498 --> 44:37.196
Fascinating.

44:37.239 --> 44:39.589
A large quantity of water vapor
from the comet

44:39.633 --> 44:40.721
is entering
the planet's atmosphere.

44:41.766 --> 44:43.550
If I am not mistaken,

44:43.593 --> 44:45.813
this will permanently change
the atmospheric composition

44:45.857 --> 44:49.382
-of Persephone III.
-Change it how?

44:49.425 --> 44:51.732
Reducing the planet's aridity
will make it more amenable

44:51.776 --> 44:54.039
to plant growth, agriculture

44:54.082 --> 44:57.477
and, one might surmise,
societal development.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.784
So...

44:59.827 --> 45:02.961
did it actually "bring life"?

45:03.918 --> 45:06.529
Don't tell me the space monks
were actually right.

45:10.403 --> 45:11.970
Captain,

45:12.013 --> 45:13.580
Shepherds are hailing us.

45:13.623 --> 45:16.496
Open a channel.
On screen, please, Ensign.

45:16.539 --> 45:19.804
You have seen the glory
and the mercy

45:19.847 --> 45:22.154
that isM'hanit.

45:22.197 --> 45:25.635
You're right.
We witnessed a miracle.

45:25.679 --> 45:29.074
Perhaps in the future,
you will not be so quick

45:29.117 --> 45:31.859
to judge the faith of others.

45:33.861 --> 45:35.471
And so

45:35.515 --> 45:38.648
-we shall not part as enemies.
-Thank you.

46:19.559 --> 46:22.562
Captain's log, supplemental.

46:22.605 --> 46:25.783
I am left to wonder

46:25.826 --> 46:28.481
who made the comet?

46:29.482 --> 46:32.093
How many more like it
are out there?

46:35.836 --> 46:37.925
Was it coincidence
that fostered the chance

46:37.969 --> 46:39.884
for more life on Persephone III?

46:41.886 --> 46:43.757
Or something more?

46:46.542 --> 46:49.197
Look, we already knew
how to turn musical notes

46:49.241 --> 46:50.677
-into numbers, right?

46:50.720 --> 46:52.722
But the computer
helped me turn those numbers

46:52.766 --> 46:54.899
into numerical coordinates.

46:54.942 --> 46:57.162
You're saying the numbers
painted a picture?

46:57.205 --> 46:59.686
Yes. But not just any picture.

46:59.729 --> 47:01.819
The music contained this image.

47:02.907 --> 47:05.561
This is a star chart
showing the comet's course,

47:05.605 --> 47:08.956
a course that includes
it moving past Persephone III.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.045
You are suggesting
the comet was telling us

47:11.089 --> 47:14.179
-it did not intend
to hit Persephone III?
-Yes.

47:14.222 --> 47:15.876
It meant no harm.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.357
That was the message.

47:18.400 --> 47:19.749
But if I had not interfered,

47:19.793 --> 47:21.447
it would have destroyed
the planet.

47:21.490 --> 47:25.320
Okay,
here's where things get weirder.

47:25.364 --> 47:29.063
When we zoom in on the image,
we find this shape.

47:30.064 --> 47:32.197
And this is an image
of the chunk of ice

47:32.240 --> 47:33.981
that broke off from the comet
as Lieutenant Spock

47:34.025 --> 47:35.809
flew his mission.

47:36.766 --> 47:38.551
-They're identical.
-You're saying

47:38.594 --> 47:40.161
the comet sent this message

47:40.205 --> 47:43.382
before Spock was able to correct
the comet's course?

47:43.425 --> 47:45.036
We recorded it hours earlier.

47:45.079 --> 47:46.689
It is highly improbable

47:46.733 --> 47:48.169
the comet could have
randomly guessed

47:48.213 --> 47:49.867
the shape
the ice that fell off would take

47:49.910 --> 47:51.346
with such accuracy.

47:51.390 --> 47:53.783
Unless your flight was foretold.

47:53.827 --> 47:56.830
You're suggesting
the comet had foreknowledge

47:56.874 --> 47:58.701
of future events?

47:58.745 --> 48:02.009
The comet's flight path
and its, I don't know, mission

48:02.053 --> 48:04.446
to seed that planet
was predicated

48:04.490 --> 48:06.709
on you flying that shuttle
to move it.

48:06.753 --> 48:10.191
It knew its fate, you might say.

48:12.193 --> 48:15.153
Thank you for your report,
Cadet.

48:20.158 --> 48:22.203
Cadet Uhura.

48:24.162 --> 48:27.730
As I said, many dream
of being worthy of Starfleet,

48:27.774 --> 48:29.558
of representing its values

48:29.602 --> 48:32.518
of selflessness,
courage, sacrifice.

48:32.561 --> 48:35.825
-I know it shouldn't
have been me down there...
-I have not finished, Cadet.

48:39.351 --> 48:41.309
The odds of us surviving were,

48:41.353 --> 48:43.094
in fact, quite low.

48:43.137 --> 48:46.053
No pep talk
could have increased them.

48:46.097 --> 48:48.186
I understand
you did not come to Starfleet

48:48.229 --> 48:49.622
the way many of us have.

48:49.665 --> 48:52.016
That you are not sure
you wish to stay.

48:52.059 --> 48:54.496
But, having observed
your actions on the comet,

48:54.540 --> 48:57.064
I am certain,
should you choose to,

48:57.108 --> 48:59.066
Starfleet would be fortunate

48:59.110 --> 49:00.720
to have an officer like you.

49:00.763 --> 49:02.940
Thank you, sir.

49:19.434 --> 49:22.437
A little piece of ice and dust
roaming through space

49:22.481 --> 49:24.091
brings life.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.575
I bet you not one of us
could have predicted how.

49:31.185 --> 49:33.709
I'll give you that.

49:33.753 --> 49:37.713
So, just because you receive
a message from the future

49:37.757 --> 49:39.802
doesn't mean you understand it.

49:39.846 --> 49:42.805
We're not talking
about the comet anymore, are we?

49:46.809 --> 49:48.333
Don't throw your life away,
Chris.

49:49.334 --> 49:51.684
-Number One...
-I know you had

49:51.727 --> 49:54.687
-a vision of the future, but...
-I made a choice.

49:54.730 --> 49:57.385
I accepted my fate. It...

49:57.429 --> 49:59.648
It goes beyond my own life.

49:59.692 --> 50:01.650
What if you're wrong?

50:01.694 --> 50:03.130
What if you got that message

50:03.174 --> 50:05.350
so you could save those kids
and that's it?

50:05.393 --> 50:08.875
What if you don't have
to ruin your life, too?

50:10.094 --> 50:12.487
How do you know you can't make
a different choice?

50:12.531 --> 50:15.142
One that saves all of you?

50:17.449 --> 50:20.060
What if your fate

50:20.104 --> 50:21.801
is what you make it?

50:31.724 --> 50:33.508
Computer,

50:33.552 --> 50:36.207
call up
all available information

50:36.250 --> 50:38.774
for the following
Federation citizens.

50:41.777 --> 50:44.041
Dusty Swender.

50:44.084 --> 50:46.086
T'quiel Dawn.

50:47.914 --> 50:50.525
Muliq Al Alcazar.

50:52.136 --> 50:54.616
Yuuto Hoshide.

50:56.749 --> 50:58.794
Andrea Lopez.
