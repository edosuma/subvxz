WEBVTT

00:53.052 --> 00:55.847
LET'S GO.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.643
WHAT IS IT?

01:00.727 --> 01:01.811
I DON'T KNOW.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.147
GUYS! CAN WE PLEASE
GET OUT OF HERE?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.940
{\an1}DON'T! YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN IT.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.818
{\an1}HELLO? DOES ANYONE ELSE
REALIZE WE ARE IN DANGER?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.654
{\an1}LET'S NOT GET HYSTERICAL
ABOUT IT.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.740
PLEASE CAN WE GO!

01:13.823 --> 01:15.158
(Loud wailing)
(They scream)

01:15.241 --> 01:16.659
{\an5}LET'S NOT GET HYSTERIL
ABOUT IT?

01:16.743 --> 01:17.577
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE NOW.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.246
OH, NOW YOU LISTEN.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.294
AMBER? AMBER? AMBER!

01:26.377 --> 01:28.046
WHAT?!

01:28.129 --> 01:29.631
YOU HAVE TO GET UP.
WE'LL BE LATE.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.966
{\an1}I CAN'T. I DIDN'T SLEEP A
WINK ALL NIGHT.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.677
EXCEPT FOR RIGHT NOW?

01:34.761 --> 01:38.681
{\an1}TRUTH TIME. DO YOU BELIEVE
IN WEREWOLVES NINA?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.476
NO. WHY?

01:41.559 --> 01:45.730
{\an4}I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS
MAKING THE WAILING NOISE
LAST NIGHT.

01:45.814 --> 01:49.192
{\an1}AMBER, I DON'T THINK THAT
WAS A WEREWOLF.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.027
{\an1}WELL, WHAT ELSE COULD HAVE
MADE A NOISE LIKE THAT?

01:51.110 --> 01:52.153
(Door creaks open)

01:52.237 --> 01:57.200
(Cat meows)

01:59.160 --> 02:00.286
A CAT?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.372
YEAH. A BLACK CAT,
OF COURSE.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.707
{\an1}NOTHING COULD EVER BE NOT
CREEPY IN THIS PLACE.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.543
{\an1}AND WE'RE HIDING IT IN OUR
ROOM! CAT-NAPPING.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.127
GET IT? HA HA HA.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.048
{\an4}AND YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT
WAS MAKING THE WAILING NOISE
LAST NIGHT?

02:12.131 --> 02:15.844
{\an1}(Amber tries to immitate)
MWOOOW! MWOOOW!

02:15.927 --> 02:17.929
PSSSS. PSSS.

02:18.012 --> 02:21.558
MWOOOW!

02:21.641 --> 02:25.061
{\an1}STOP MAKING THAT DREADFUL
NOISE.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.399
{\an1}WHY WERE YOU MAKING THAT
NOISE EXACTLY?

02:29.482 --> 02:33.987
{\an4}DRAMA EXERCISES. MR WINKLER
SAYS I NEED TO BREATHE FROM
MY DIAPHRAGM.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.239
{\an1}HAVE YOU LOST ANYTHING
VICTOR?

02:36.322 --> 02:39.576
MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU FIND
WHATEVER IT IS YOU LOST.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.578
YEAH. NINA IS SUPER SLEUTHY.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.039
{\an1}COURSE I HAVEN'T LOST
ANYTHING!

02:45.748 --> 02:48.251
DID YOU SEE HIS REACTION?

02:48.334 --> 02:49.961
IT'S OBVIOUSLY VICTOR'S CAT.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.546
VICTOR DOESN'T HAVE A CAT.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.715
TELL THAT TO HIS CAT.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.174
{\an1}HE MUST HAVE BEEN HIDING IT
IN THE CELLAR.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.010
{\an1}THAT'S WHY THE WAILING
SOUNDED SO LOUD.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.804
{\an1}AND NOW IT'S ESCAPED AND
HE'S LOOKING FOR IT.

02:59.888 --> 03:04.684
{\an4}WELL I'M GOING TO TAKE KITTY
SOME MILK. I BET IT'S
HUNGRY.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.979
{\an4}DO YOU THINK IT WAS MEANT TO
BE TIED TO THAT RING THING
WE SAW IN THE CELLAR?

03:08.062 --> 03:12.775
{\an4}THAT'S SO CRUEL. I'M REALLY
STARTING TO THINK VICTOR IS
UP TO NO GOOD.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.701
{\an1}THOUGHT ANY MORE ABOUT WHAT
I SAID LAST NIGHT?

03:21.784 --> 03:25.079
{\an1}YEAH. AND I'M INTERESTED IN
HEARING WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.082
IF YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE
I CAN SEE THEM AT ALL TIMES.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.709
IN PRIVATE.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.212
OH, ERR, I'LL

03:35.673 --> 03:40.011
{\an1}CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THIS.
WHY DO YOU WANT MY LOCKET?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.473
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT?

03:43.556 --> 03:44.515
MY ROOM.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.600
{\an1}AND WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
WITH IT?

03:45.683 --> 03:48.311
DRINK IT. DUH.

03:48.394 --> 03:48.728
FROM A BOWL?

03:48.811 --> 03:51.147
IT'S TRES FRENCH.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.523
GIVE IT TO ME.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.025
OOOH THAT LOOKS SORE!

03:54.108 --> 03:55.652
BEAT IT!

03:55.735 --> 03:57.654
EVERYONE IS SO RUDE TODAY.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.324
{\an4}AND THIS FRIEND OF MINE
RECKONS IT COULD BE WORTH
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.408
MAYBE EVEN MILLIONS.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.910
REALLY?

04:03.993 --> 04:06.204
{\an4}YEAH. HE'S AN EXPERT ON
EGYPT AND HE KNOWS ABOUT
THESE THINGS.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.998
{\an1}AND AS SOON AS I MENTIONED
YOUR LOCKET.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.543
{\an4}WHY WOULD YOU MENTION MY
LOCKET? IT JUST CAME UP IN
CONVERSATION?

04:12.627 --> 04:16.339
{\an1}YEAH. ANYWAY, HE THINKS IT
COULD BE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.173
{\an1}THAT'S WHY I WAS TRYING TO
'BORROW' IT BEFORE.

04:18.257 --> 04:22.512
{\an1}SO I COULD SHOW IT TO HIM.
GET CONFIRMATION.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.889
{\an4}IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
BORROWING WITHOUT PERMISSION

04:24.973 --> 04:26.933
IS ALSO KNOWN AS STEALING.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.060
{\an1}YEAH OKAY, I WAS WRONG TO DO
THAT.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.270
{\an1}BUT NOW I'M BEING STRAIGHT
WITH YOU.

04:31.354 --> 04:35.483
{\an1}SO ARE YOU INTERESTED IN
MEETING HIM OR NOT?

04:35.566 --> 04:38.861
{\an1}THE LOCKET ISN'T FOR SALE.
IT'S A FRIEND'S.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.530
I'M KEEPING IT FOR HER.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.032
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MEET HIM?

04:43.116 --> 04:46.869
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.873
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT
PATRICIA'S JUST TOLD ME.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.460
MEASLES. PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.337
{\an1}I NEED TO FAKE SICK TO WATCH
THE CAT.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.507
{\an1}YEAH I'M SURE TRUDY'S NEVER
HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

05:00.383 --> 05:04.012
{\an1}VICTOR CAUGHT ME COMING UPSTAIRS
WITH A BOWL OF MILK.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.973
{\an1}I THINK HE'S SUSPICIOUS. AND
HE'S GOT A SCRATCH ON HIS ARM.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.392
{\an1}IT'S DEFINITELY HIS CAT
YOU KNOW.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.644
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WAS
GOING TO DO WITH IT?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.396
I DON'T KNOW.

05:13.479 --> 05:17.275
{\an4}WELL ONE THING'S FOR SURE I
AM NOT LEAVING IT ON ITS OWN
HERE ALL DAY.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.903
{\an1}SO IF SPOTS WON'T DO IT,
I'LL NEED A FEVER INSTEAD.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.949
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS
"FRIEND" THOUGH, ARE YOU?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.326
IS IT A TERRIBLE IDEA?
I'M JUST SO INTRIGUED.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.788
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT
COULD BE DANGEROUS.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.331
IT'S SOMEONE PATRICIA KNOWS.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.835
{\an4}I MEAN, SHE MAY BE LOTS OF
THINGS, BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE WANTS ME HURT.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.086
THEN AGAIN

05:37.170 --> 05:39.088
{\an1}BUT IT IS SOMEONE WHO WANTS
THE LOCKET.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.342
{\an4}SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN
THE LOCKET AND MAY BE ABLE
TO GIVE US SOME MORE INFORMATION

05:43.426 --> 05:46.596
ABOUT ITS HISTORY, ITS POWER,
ITS CONNECTION TO THE SEARCH.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.265
I DON'T LIKE IT.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.310
I WON'T EVEN TAKE IT WITH ME
OKAY? I'LL LEAVE IT WITH YOU.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.313
ARE YOU SURE?

05:55.396 --> 06:00.902
{\an1}DESPITE ALL THE SCREAMING.
I TRUST YOU.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.404
THANK-YOU. I SUPPOSE.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.324
{\an4}I HEARD AMBER'S REALLY,
REALLY ILL. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

06:06.407 --> 06:12.080
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE FINE BY
SAY, END OF CLASSES TODAY.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.591
OKAY SWEETIE,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.136
OH MY WORD!

06:27.220 --> 06:28.137
WHAT IS IT?

06:28.221 --> 06:28.721
{\an1}I'LL HAVE TO PHONE AN
AMBULANCE. OH MY GOODNESS.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.933
NO, NO. I'TS OKAY.

06:32.016 --> 06:36.562
{\an5}LET'S JUST GIVE IT A FEW
HOURS SHALL WE? I'M SURE
IT'LL GO DOWN ON ITS OWN.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.982
WELL YOU DON'T FEEL
PARTICULARLY HOT.

06:40.066 --> 06:44.487
{\an1}OKAY. WELL WE'LL LEAVE IT
FOR NOW.

06:48.741 --> 06:53.746
{\an1}COME ON KITTY. COME HAVE A
CUDDLE WITH AMBER.

06:53.830 --> 06:58.584
(Cat meows)

07:01.045 --> 07:02.296
JEROME. MARA,
EXCELLENT AS USUAL.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.007
{\an1}ABOUT FIFTY PAGES LONGER
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.343
{\an1}BUT EXCELLENT ALL THE SAME.
PATRICIA, NOT BAD.

07:07.426 --> 07:11.514
{\an1}NOT BAD AT ALL. AND MICK
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

07:11.597 --> 07:14.350
RIGHT BACK TO SQUARE ONE
WITH A RESOUNDING THUMP.

07:14.433 --> 07:20.022
{\an1}D+ AND I WAS BEING KIND.
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.190
(school bell rings)

07:21.274 --> 07:27.071
{\an4}ALL RIGHT EVERYBODY, PUT
YOUR BOOKS AWAY QUIETLY.
QUIETLY!

07:27.155 --> 07:29.824
MADE YOUR MIND UP YET?

07:29.907 --> 07:31.409
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.869
GOOD MOVE.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.540
{\an4}IF YOU WANT ME TO START
HELPING YOU AGAIN,
YOU ONLY HAVE TO ASK.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.209
{\an1}WHICH MEANS I'LL SAY YES IF
I WASN'T CLEAR JUST THEN.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.045
WHAT'S THE POINT? I'M
HOPELESS AT SCIENCE.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.547
{\an1}LET'S FACE IT. I'M HOPELESS
AT EVERYTHING.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.716
NO YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE
BRILLIANT AT SPORTS.

07:46.799 --> 07:50.678
WOW, BIG DEAL. MY DAD WANTS
ME TO BE A DOCTOR LIKE HIM.

07:50.761 --> 07:54.307
{\an1}I DON'T THINK SPORT'S GOING
TO BE MUCH HELP THERE DO YOU?

07:54.390 --> 07:59.353
{\an4}NO. DEFINITELY NOT.
BUT THAT'S YOUR DAD,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?

08:03.816 --> 08:07.612
(Door creaks)

08:10.031 --> 08:15.036
(Cat meows)

08:18.998 --> 08:21.083
WHAT YOU DOING?

08:21.167 --> 08:24.086
{\an1}I MADE AMBER A GET WELL SOON
CARD. IT'S AWESOME.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.922
AMBER IN A COFFIN?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.507
{\an4}YEAH I'M SURE THAT'S GOING
TO MAKE HER FEEL A
WHOLE LOT BETTER.

08:28.591 --> 08:32.260
{\an1}THAT'S JUST THE IMAGE,
READ THE POEM.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.265
{\an1}'I HOPE YOU DIDN'T NEED AN
AMBULANCE,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.893
{\an1}COS I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
AMBER-LESS.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.437
WITHOUT YOU
CLASSES WERE NO FUN,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.732
SO GET UP AMBER
YOU LAZY BUM'

08:46.234 --> 08:47.443
HEY! WHAT YOU DOING?

08:47.526 --> 08:50.655
{\an1}THE BIGGEST FAVOR ANYONE HAS
EVER DONE FOR YOU.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.662
{\an1}SO, UM, WHAT'S THE NAME OF
YOUR FRIEND?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.997
RENE.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.543
{\an4}OKAY. RENE. AND,
WHY DO WE HAVE TO MEET HIM
ALL THE WAYOUT HERE?

09:04.627 --> 09:08.172
BECAUSE WE DO. NOW STOP
COMPLAINING AND KEEP UP.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.217
COMPLAINING?

09:14.095 --> 09:20.309
{\an1}HERE KITTY. HERE PUSS, PUSS,
PUSS. MR. BLACK TOES?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.853
{\an1}AMBER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT OF BED?

09:22.937 --> 09:25.648
{\an1}TRUDY, WAS THAT DOOR OPEN
WHEN YOU CAME IN?

09:25.731 --> 09:27.024
YES, I THINK IT WAS.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.568
OH NO! WHERE'S VICTOR?

09:29.652 --> 09:32.405
WELL HE POPPED OUT ABOUT AN
HOUR AGO. WHY? ARE YOU OKAY?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.323
DID HE HAVE A CAT WITH HIM?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.951
{\an1}UH OH, I THINK THAT'S THE
FEVER TALKING.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.494
{\an1}OKAY, LETS JUST GET BACK
INTO BED.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.746
{\an1}MUST BE IN THE CELLAR. WE
HAVE TO GO AND LOOK.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.499
{\an1}OKAY, WELL MAYBE LATER WE'LL
GO AND FIND THIS CAT.

09:43.582 --> 09:48.129
{\an4}BUT FOR NOW LET'S GET BACK
INTO BED AND I'LL TAKE YOUR
TEMPERATURE AGAIN.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.505
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A FEVER!

09:49.588 --> 09:51.173
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.801
WE NEED TO FIND THE CAT.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.764
GET BACK!

09:59.890 --> 10:02.810
IT'S RUFUS. RENE. WHATEVER.

10:02.893 --> 10:07.148
BUT THAT'S THE MAN I SAW
VISITING SARAH YESTERDAY.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.501
{\an1}OK. WHAT'S GOING ON? AND WHAT'S
VICTOR GOT TO DO WITH IT?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.685
SO YOU SAW RUFUS VISITING
THIS OLD LADY, SARAH?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.854
{\an1}YEAH. SHE'S THE ONE WHO GAVE
ME THE LOCKET.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.065
{\an1}THE LOCKET THAT RUFUS IS SO
INTERESTED IN.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.442
{\an1}MAYBE RUFUS WAS A JEWELLERY
TRADER.

10:51.525 --> 10:55.738
{\an1}AND VICTOR ALSO COLLECTS
DIAMONDS?

10:55.821 --> 10:58.741
{\an1}WHAT IF THE SECOND VOICE ON
THOSE RECORDINGS

10:58.824 --> 10:59.992
IS REALLY VICTOR?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.244
THAT WOULD MAKE
VICTOR ABOUT 120.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.665
{\an4}REMEMBER SARAH ON THE
RECORDINGS SHE TALKED ABOUT
EXPERIMENTS DOWN IN THE CELLAR?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.584
AND WHAT WAS VICTOR
MAKING A TOAST TO

11:08.668 --> 11:10.586
{\an1}WHEN HE DRANK THAT FUNNY
COLOURED STUFF DOWN THERE?

11:10.669 --> 11:12.380
{\an3}LIFE.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.257
OKAY. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT

11:15.341 --> 11:20.221
{\an5}VICTOR HAS SOME KIND OF AN
ELIXIR THAT KEEPS HIM FROM
GROWING OLD?

11:20.304 --> 11:23.057
{\an1}OH YEAH, AND A JEWELLERY
HEIST IS SUCH A CRAZY IDEA.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.600
THIS IS MAD.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.311
{\an1}WHAT HAS ANY OF THIS GOT TO
DO WITH JOY, OR RUFUS?

11:27.395 --> 11:27.770
I DON'T KNOW.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.813
AND THE CAT?

11:28.896 --> 11:34.151
{\an1}<i>I HATE TO BREAK UP THIS</i>
<i>COSY LITTLE CHAT,</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:37.071
{\an1}BUT 10 O'CLOCK IS FAST
APPROACHING.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.615
{\an1}I SHALL, OF COURSE, WISH TO
HEAR A PIN DROP,

11:39.698 --> 11:45.871
{\an4}SO I SUGGEST YOU START
GETTING READY FOR BED
IMMEDIATELY.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.379
<i>SO, CAN ANYONE TELL ME,</i>

11:53.462 --> 12:00.553
{\an4}<i>WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>BETWEEN ELECTRICAL CURRENT</i>
<i>AND CHARGE FLOW?</i>

12:00.636 --> 12:01.971
{\an1}ALFIE?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.139
{\an4}I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO
BE DISSECTING A RAT THIS
WEEK MR SWEET?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.474
URGH, GROSS!

12:05.558 --> 12:09.353
{\an4}I THINK EXPERIMENTING ON
ANIMALS IS CRUEL AND
UNNECESSARY.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.188
{\an1}ESPECIALLY EXPERIMENTING
ON CATS!

12:11.272 --> 12:14.567
{\an4}<i>I DON'T THINK ANYONE</i>
<i>EXPERIMENTS ON CATS</i>
<i>NOWADAYS AMBER.</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:15.818
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.070
{\an1}I MEAN, WHAT IF SOMEONE WAS
TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING,

12:18.154 --> 12:22.032
{\an1}LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, JUST OFF
THE TOP OF MY HEAD,

12:22.116 --> 12:24.410
AN ELIXIR OF LIFE OR
SOMETHING?

12:25.077 --> 12:31.250
{\an1}STRANGE IDEA. WHAT A STRANGE,
HA HA HA, RIDICULOUS IDEA.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.668
{\an1}IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I
READ IN A BOOK THAT'S ALL.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.714
{\an1}WELL, SOME ALCHEMISTS IN
THE MIDDLE AGES

12:36.797 --> 12:40.134
{\an4}DID DEVOTE THEIR LIFE
TO SEARCHING FOR AN
ELIXIR OF LIFE.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.345
{\an4}I'M SURE THEY EXPERIMENTED
ON ANIMALS AS PART OF THEIR
QUEST.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.388
AND NOW, (clap clap clap)

12:44.472 --> 12:49.560
{\an1}CAN WE PLEASE GET BACK TO
ELECTRICAL CHARGE FLOW?

12:49.643 --> 12:51.687
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

12:51.770 --> 12:52.938
IT'S CALLED RESEARCH.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.523
{\an1}DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT EXPERIMENTS?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.942
THAT'S WHY VICTOR HAD A CAT.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.153
HE WAS USING IT TO
EXPERIMENT ON.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.529
SEE? I'M A GENIUS.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.363
SHE'S GOT A POINT.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.365
I MEAN ABOUT THE CAT.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.534
WE NEED TO TELL SOMEONE.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.411
{\an1}WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS BY
OURSELVES,

13:07.495 --> 13:09.371
I MEAN, WHO CAN WE TRUST?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.080
WHAT ABOUT JASON?

13:10.164 --> 13:10.414
NO.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.666
TRUDY?

13:12.750 --> 13:13.667
POSSIBLY.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.252
WHAT WE REALLY NEED
IS SOME PROOF.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.046
{\an5}WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS
TO GO AND RESCUE THE CAT
FROM THE CELLAR

13:17.129 --> 13:20.549
{\an5}BEFORE IT BECOMES PART OF
VICTOR'S EVIL POINTY-FACED
SCHEME.

13:20.633 --> 13:25.554
NINA, YOU HAVE TO LET US IN.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.479
{\an1}OK, THIS IS ALL SERIOUSLY
WEIRD.

13:33.562 --> 13:39.527
{\an4}I KNOW. AND I'VE SEEN A LOT
OF REALLY WEIRD THINGS THE
LAST FEW DAYS.

13:39.610 --> 13:45.574
THERE YOU ARE KITTY SPICE.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.410
AAAAAGH! GET OUT! GET OUT!
GET OUT!

13:48.494 --> 13:48.869
WHAT IS IT?

13:48.953 --> 13:52.373
IT'S STUFFED!

13:54.041 --> 13:57.753
{\an5}(Crying) HOW COULD HE?
HOW COULD HE?

13:54.041 --> 13:57.753
{\an1}SSSH!

13:57.836 --> 13:59.755
{\an1}I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:59.838 --> 14:01.465
{\an1}OH TRUDY, THERE WAS A
CAT IN THE CELLAR

14:01.549 --> 14:06.804
{\an5}AND THEN IT ESCAPED AND I
WAS LOOKING AFTER IT BUT
THEN VICTOR TOOK IT BACK,

14:06.887 --> 14:08.264
{\an1}AND HE USED IT FOR HIS
EXPERIMENTS

14:08.347 --> 14:13.769
{\an4}AND NOW IT'S DEAD AND I'M
REALLY, REALLY SCARED AND
PLEASE CAN YOU HELP.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.271
HEY-HEY. SLOW DOWN.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.147
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.482
PATRICIA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:18.566 --> 14:19.692
{\an1}I THINK YOU NEED TO ASK
VICTOR THAT.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.110
WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT
VICTOR?

14:21.193 --> 14:24.154
{\an4}AND PLEASE DON'T START AGAIN
WITH THE VICTOR'S A VAMPIRE
THING.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.574
{\an1}YOU'RE EITHER VERY GOOD OR
THEY HAVEN'T GOT TO YOU YET.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.243
WHO HASN'T GOT TO ME YET?

14:29.326 --> 14:30.578
OH PATRICIA, WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:30.661 --> 14:33.581
TRUDY, WILL YOU HELP US?

14:33.664 --> 14:34.957
YEAH, PLEASE TRUDY.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.042
WILL YOU? WE NEED YOU.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.627
{\an1}YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WE CAN
TRUST.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.922
OH DARLINGS OF COURSE I
WILL.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.473
THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING.

14:51.557 --> 14:57.104
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH PRIME
NUMBERS, SQUARE ROOTS, SUDOKU.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.440
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:59.523 --> 15:03.986
{\an4}I'M JUST WORRIED THAT AMBER
PLUS PATRICIA PLUS CELLAR
EQUALS TROUBLE.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.821
WE SHOULD HAVE ALL GONE.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.741
{\an1}ALL FOUR OF US SNEAKING DOWN
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

15:08.824 --> 15:10.993
IT'S FAR TOO RISKY.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.911
WHAT'S TOO RISKY?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.124
WHAT IS THAT?

15:17.207 --> 15:17.833
{\an1}IT'S JUST A... JUST A MATH
PROBLEM.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.377
NOTHING YOU WOULD
UNDERSTAND.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.920
CAN I HAVE A TRY?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.714
NO.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.175
OKAY.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.887
UM, WE...

15:26.258 --> 15:29.887
SSSHH.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.642
ONE, TWO AND NINE.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.435
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

15:36.518 --> 15:37.686
I SAID ONE, TWO AND NINE.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.229
{\an1}I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE
PROBLEM IS,

15:39.313 --> 15:44.068
{\an4}BUT THEY'RE THE NUMBERS
THAT ARE FEATURED
MOST...FIVE POUNDS, PLEASE.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.779
GET LOST.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.490
GUESS WHAT GUYS.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.283
TRUDY GOING TO HELP US.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.036
HELP YOU WITH WHAT?

15:56.997 --> 16:00.584
AND THE PLOT THICKENS
AS THEY SAY.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.462
AND YOU TOLD TRUDY
EVERYTHING?

16:03.545 --> 16:04.838
WELL NOT EVERYTHING
OBVIOUSLY.

16:04.922 --> 16:09.677
{\an1}BUT ENOUGH. THE CATS, THE
EXPERIMENT, VICTOR.

16:09.760 --> 16:15.307
{\an4}WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HIM OPEN
UP THAT CELLAR AND SHOW US
EXACTLY WHAT'S DOWN THERE.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.850
AFTERNOON EVERYONE.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.560
(Everyone) AFTERNOON.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.773
{\an4}TIME MARCHES ON AND WE NEED
TO DECIDE ON A SUBJECT
MATTER FOR OUR SCHOOL PLAY.

16:22.856 --> 16:27.945
{\an1}I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD
WRITE OUR OWN. IDEAS ANYONE?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.951
NO? OKAY.

16:34.034 --> 16:40.416
ERM, HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
ON EGYPT?

16:40.499 --> 16:41.417
EGYPT?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.001
I KNOW.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.295
{\an4}HOW ABOUT WE DO A STORY
ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL WHO LOSES
HER PARENTS

16:45.379 --> 16:48.674
{\an4}IN MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
WHEN THEY STEAL SOME TREASURE
FROM AN EGYPTIAN PYRAMID?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.134
UH-OH....

16:50.217 --> 16:52.594
{\an4}AND THEN THE GIRL IS BROUGHT UP
BY A WEIRD GUARDIAN IN A BIG,
OLD HOUSE.

16:52.678 --> 16:57.307
{\an4}BUT THE GUARDIAN TRIES TO
STEAL THE TREASURE AND THE
GIRL HAS TO TRY AND STOP HIM

16:57.391 --> 16:59.143
BUT THEN SHE GETS HELP FROM
SOME FRIENDS FROM THE FUTURE

16:59.226 --> 17:03.188
AND THEY FIND THE TREASURE
AND THE GIRL'S REALLY HAPPY

17:03.272 --> 17:07.358
{\an4}AND THE FRIENDS ARE VERY
RICH AND THEY ALL LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

17:07.443 --> 17:11.029
THE END.

17:11.113 --> 17:17.118
{\an1}HEY. WELL DONE AMBER. YEAH,
THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.455
{\an5}DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A GO AT
WRITING UP AN OUTLINE IN
TIME FOR THE NEXT SESSION?

17:20.539 --> 17:24.167
{\an1}UM, I THINK I MIGHT NEED
SOME HELP WITH THAT.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.045
NINA?

17:30.966 --> 17:35.262
OKAY, VICTOR'S ON HIS WAY.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.014
{\an1}I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.350
{\an1}IT ALL SOUNDS TOTALLY
FAR-FETCHED TO ME.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.562
{\an4}I KNOW. BUT AS SOON AS YOU
SEE ALL THE WEIRD STUFF IN
THAT CELLAR

17:43.645 --> 17:44.438
AND THE DEAD CAT!

17:44.521 --> 17:46.899
{\an1}YOU'LL REALIZE WE'RE
TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.861
{\an5}YOU LOT WOULDN'T KNOW THE
TRUTH IF IT JUMPED UP AND
HIT YOU IN THE EYE.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.990
NOW THEN TRUDY, WHAT'S ALL
THIS ABOUT?

17:55.073 --> 17:56.825
{\an1}WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME
FOR?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.995
{\an1}IT'S NOT SO MUCH ME, AS THE
STUDENTS.

18:00.078 --> 18:03.707
{\an1}THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THIS
CAT THAT AMBER FOUND.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.667
A CAT?

18:05.751 --> 18:14.218
{\an1}WELL, THEY ALL SEEM TO THINK
THAT YOU'VE KILLED IT.

18:14.593 --> 18:18.263
KILLED IT?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.516
YOU THINK I'VE KILLED A
CAT TRUDY?

18:20.599 --> 18:25.395
{\an1}NO, NO I DON'T. IT'S JUST
WELL, THEY ALL DO.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.897
WHY ON EARTH WOULD I
KILL A CAT?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.650
{\an5}FOR YOUR EXPERIMENTS
IN THE CELLAR!

18:29.733 --> 18:32.361
{\an1}<i>YEAH, ASK HIM ABOUT THE</i>
<i>SCRATCHES ON HIS ARM TRUDY.</i>

18:32.444 --> 18:33.821
{\an1}<i>CLEARLY VISIBLE CAT</i>
<i>SCRATCHES.</i>

18:33.904 --> 18:36.281
QUIET!

18:36.365 --> 18:42.329
{\an1}WELL, HOW DID YOU GET THOSE
SCRATCHES VICTOR?

18:42.412 --> 18:45.124
THERE WAS A CAT.

18:45.207 --> 18:49.211
{\an1}A STRAY, WHICH I PUT IT IN
THE CELLAR FOR SAFE KEEPING.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.714
AS IT WAS MY INTENTION TO
CALL THE ANIMAL SANCTUARY,

18:52.798 --> 18:55.050
{\an1}HOWEVER, IN THE MEANTIME
IT ESCAPED.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.804
{\an1}AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
IDEA WHERE IT IS NOW.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.222
LIAR! HE KILLED IT.

19:00.305 --> 19:06.186
{\an1}HA HA HA. CHILDREN! THEY HAVE
SUCH VIVID IMAGINATIONS.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.730
{\an1}PERHAPS WE COULD JUST PUT
ALL THIS BEHIND US

19:08.814 --> 19:13.193
{\an1}BY POPPING DOWN TO THE CELLAR
AND TAKING A PEEK?

19:16.029 --> 19:19.283
{\an1}ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY
VERSION OF EVENTS TRUDY?

19:19.366 --> 19:22.369
NO, NO. IT'S JUST

19:22.452 --> 19:26.915
I AM SHOCKED TRUDY.

19:26.999 --> 19:32.170
{\an1}I AM SHOCKED AND HURT BY
YOUR OBVIOUS LACK OF TRUST.

19:32.254 --> 19:36.425
{\an1}WELL, IF IT PUTS THE
STUDENTS' MINDS AT REST THEN?

19:36.508 --> 19:41.138
{\an1}YOU WANT TO SEE DOWN IN THE
CELLAR? HMM? VERY WELL, FINE.

19:41.221 --> 19:44.349
{\an1}I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S DOWN IN
THE CELLAR! COME WITH ME.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.644
COME ALL.

19:50.898 --> 19:55.235
(Victor whistles)

20:07.539 --> 20:09.666
(Meow)

20:09.750 --> 20:11.001
OH!

20:11.084 --> 20:16.131
{\an1}AHA, THE CAT I PRESUME.
LOOKS VERY MUCH ALIVE TO ME.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.051
VICTOR I AM SO SORRY.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.344
HOW COULD YOU SET ME
UP LIKE THAT?

20:20.427 --> 20:22.888
{\an1}WE DIDN'T SET YOU UP
TRUDY. HONEST.

20:22.971 --> 20:26.016
BUT, I SAW IT.
IT WAS DEAD.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.353
THERE WERE LOTS OF
THINGS DOWN HERE.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.605
{\an1}REALLY, REALLY CREEPY
THINGS.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.690
{\an1}WE COULDN'T MAKE UP THINGS
THAT CREEPY OR STUFFED.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.984
SILENCE!

20:36.068 --> 20:40.322
{\an4}TRUDY, IT HAS BEEN VERY
NICE WORKING WITH YOU
OVER THE YEARS.

20:40.405 --> 20:45.118
{\an4}BUT AFTER THIS FIASCO, I'M
AFRAID I CAN NO LONGER
CONTINUE TO DO SO.

20:45.202 --> 20:45.702
WHAT?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.245
YOU'RE FIRED!

20:47.329 --> 20:50.374
{\an3}(Gasps)
