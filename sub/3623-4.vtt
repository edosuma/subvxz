Your cousin Sean's bad news?

00:32.733 --> 00:33.565
Bad? Bad?!

00:33.567 --> 00:34.566
He trashed my scooter,

00:34.568 --> 00:35.666
poured gravy down my pants,

00:35.668 --> 00:39.104
and he tried to feed
Rufus to his pet iguana.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.906
Eeh! Eeh!

00:42.269 --> 00:43.309

Kim Possible?!

00:55.556 --> 00:56.254
Well?

00:56.256 --> 00:58.557
Uh, the usual...
I attack, she fights?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.693
Ah, have we become
that predictable?

01:01.695 --> 01:03.662
Apparently so. Arrrh!

01:03.664 --> 01:06.799
And then Sean broke
my favorite...

01:07.333 --> 01:08.934
uh, K.P.,
are you listening?

01:08.936 --> 01:09.634
Cousin Sean.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.737
Big bully.
Gravy down the pants.

Here's a news flash:
If it worked,

04:53.160 --> 04:54.258
you'd be running the world.

running is your mouth.

yourself on corn dogs

05:26.026 --> 05:27.224

That was last year,
and those were funnel cakes.

become inspired by evil again

we can.

your good and bad energies

"zap! Zap!"

17:51.004 --> 17:53.037
And now you're all
like, "boo-hoo!"

17:53.039 --> 17:56.774
Nice fish. Need to know
their place, right?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.142
Uh, yeah, uh...
You got it.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.978
I'll just go check
the security monitors.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.414
Hey, you know that evil
laugh of yours?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.049
Heh, I love it!

18:05.051 --> 18:06.584
I love it!

18:06.586 --> 18:10.021
I'm ready for you,
Kim Possible. Bring!

18:10.023 --> 18:14.092
[Laughs fiendishly]

18:15.327 --> 18:17.028
Any idea how to fix this, Wade?

18:17.030 --> 18:18.128
Well, from what I can tell,

18:18.130 --> 18:20.364
all of Drakken's badness
got transferred into Ron.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.166
If we repair the attitudinator

18:22.168 --> 18:23.601
and get Drakken
and Ron to use it,

18:23.603 --> 18:26.204
that should reverse
the process. Right?

18:26.206 --> 18:27.271
Hope so.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.906
Oh, who's a chubby mole rat?

18:28.908 --> 18:30.641
Who's a chubby little mole rat?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.610
Euwh! Euwh!

18:32.612 --> 18:33.310
[Chattering]

18:33.312 --> 18:36.114
It also means Drakken
will be evil again.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.949
That's the bad news.

18:37.951 --> 18:38.849
Uh, Drakken...

18:38.851 --> 18:41.018
We're gonna need ya
to turn bad again.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.220
But I don't want to be bad.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.122
It's better if you're bad.
Better?

18:44.124 --> 18:47.058
Well, better than Ron being bad.

18:47.060 --> 18:47.958
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.995
So I'm better at being bad
than your buddy?

18:50.997 --> 18:52.163
No, but that's good.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.731
So...

18:53.733 --> 18:55.833
Bad's better if I'm bad.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.869
Good. You got it.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.671
Whoo-hoo!
We've got an intruder.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.571
Kim Possible!

19:01.573 --> 19:03.841
Get ready for a smackdown
in my town.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.276
She's not on the monitors.
How do you know?

19:05.278 --> 19:08.980
Doing a little scannage for
the communicator's frequency.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.048
Unh! Now, why didn't he
ever think of that?

19:11.050 --> 19:14.852
That's why I'm the big dog.
Woof woof bark.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.055
Wade's gonna talk you through
how to fix the attitudinator.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.024
Ooh, goodie! I love
fixing things.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.693
I never thought I'd say
this, Dr. Drakken:

19:22.695 --> 19:24.996
I'm counting on you.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.663
Eee! Uh-huh.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.766
Don't worry.
I won't let you down.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.335
That is good in my case.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.407
Unh! Welcome, Kimberly
Ann possible.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.709
The middle name is so overkill.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.345
Overkill?
Isn't that the idea?

19:41.347 --> 19:44.749
Ah, boo-yah ha ha ha ha!

19:44.751 --> 19:48.119
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha!

19:51.823 --> 19:53.958
Ok. It should work now.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.996
We did it!

19:58.998 --> 20:00.231
Good job, guys. Now...

20:00.233 --> 20:01.531
You just have to get it on Ron,

20:01.533 --> 20:04.068
turn him good,
and you'll be evil again.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.403
[Crying]

20:05.405 --> 20:06.403
Oh, it's ok, little guy.

20:06.405 --> 20:10.107
I'm sure we'll have more
fun times after I'm evil.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.009
Uh-uh. Eee! No.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.912
Nobody told me there'd
be no evil fun times

20:14.914 --> 20:17.081
with my little mole rat buddy!

20:17.083 --> 20:18.182
Ooh, sorry.

20:18.184 --> 20:22.853
Oh, doing the right
thing is so hard.

20:31.396 --> 20:35.099
Oh, look. Kimmie
came out to play.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.242
Not bad.
But let's be honest.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.177
You could've gotten out faster.

20:46.179 --> 20:47.077
Game over, Ron.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.247
Over? I'm just
getting warmed up.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.182
The annihilator
was to keep you busy

20:51.184 --> 20:53.884
while I worked on
my real evil plan!

20:53.886 --> 20:55.753
My mega-weather generator.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.553
Your what-erator?

20:56.555 --> 20:59.090
Is it too much to ask
to be kept in the loop?

21:00.892 --> 21:04.128
All will hear me and tremble
beneath my storms

21:04.130 --> 21:09.166
and then hand over to me the
world's supply of nakkos!

21:09.168 --> 21:12.036
Boo-yeah! Ah, ha ha ha!

21:12.038 --> 21:14.305
[Thunder]

21:14.307 --> 21:16.507
Nakkos?
Figures.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.442
How obvious.
Go, Drakken.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.145
You've been a bad boy.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.247
Uh! Hey!

21:31.056 --> 21:32.023
Whoa.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.124
What happened?

21:33.126 --> 21:34.091
[Squealing]

21:34.093 --> 21:36.961
You were having a bad day.

21:38.497 --> 21:41.098
You ditched me for <i>that?</i>

21:41.100 --> 21:44.535
Did you see his
mega-weather generator?

21:45.337 --> 21:46.336
Ah! Ha ha ha ha ha!

21:46.338 --> 21:49.974
Kim Possible, for now,
it is I, Dr. Drakken,

21:49.976 --> 21:52.376
who controls
the mega-weather generator.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.146
I think we all know
what comes next.

21:55.148 --> 21:59.950
You think you're all that,
but you're...

22:01.987 --> 22:04.922
ah! Finally no more
kids' table.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.458
Thanks for being my date...
uh, friend.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.394
Admittedly, not as
awk-weird as feared.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.896
Some more cake, Ron?

22:11.898 --> 22:12.563
Is that Sean?

22:12.565 --> 22:14.065
Why, thank you, Sean.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.433
See, K.P., piece of cake.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.533
Ron, what did you...

22:16.635 --> 22:20.737
I just gave him a little
attitude adjustment.
