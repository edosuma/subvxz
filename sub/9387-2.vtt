and see another crash this year.

You were messing around in what was
basically my first apartment.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.010
Peter, you should be happy for her.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.054
-She's just having fun.
-I don't see what the problem is.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.347

to be happy.

Well, Lois, I never realized
what it was like to have a real dad.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.407
I mean, my own dad
was such a ballbuster,

15:07.491 --> 15:09.618
I guess I just always thought
that was normal.

you did those Butterfinger commercials.

-Papa Tom's being a jerk.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.462
At least he talks to you.

He's my dad and he hasn't
paid attention to me in weeks.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.384
Well, all in all, you should be thankful.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.596

and they had it put to sleep.

Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about that business
with the ice cream.

20:23.432 --> 20:26.643

about your mom.

But, hey, I'll make it up to you.
Let's play catch.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.688

-I think you should play catch with Jake.
-Really?

20:37.362 --> 20:40.449
Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like
to have a real father.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.451
I can't make him share his.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.037
Well, all right, Peter. Come on, Jake.

20:45.913 --> 20:49.291
I guess I've learned a little something
about what it means to be a good dad.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.251
Hey, Dad, do you want to play baseball?

20:51.335 --> 20:55.130

You are the neediest kid.
