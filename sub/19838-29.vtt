00:04.230 --> 00:05.250
<b>How—</b>

00:06.060 --> 00:07.180
<b><i>Stop.</i></b>

00:08.880 --> 00:10.220
<b>...did you know?</b>

00:10.220 --> 00:11.820
<b><i>What am I asking that for?</i></b>

00:13.720 --> 00:15.180
<b>It's time.</b>

00:15.180 --> 00:16.760
<b>Adding interest.</b>

01:43.990 --> 01:49.000
<b>The Strong x And x The Weak</b>

02:03.730 --> 02:06.760
<b>The time has finally come.</b>

02:16.760 --> 02:18.350
<b>At long last...</b>

02:18.350 --> 02:19.280
<b>Yep.</b>

02:20.080 --> 02:21.930
<b>The King is about to be born!</b>

02:34.430 --> 02:35.410
<b>Wait...</b>

02:36.040 --> 02:37.300
<b>It's too early!</b>

02:37.620 --> 02:38.420
<b>Silence!</b>

03:42.290 --> 03:45.070
<b>I hunger.</b>

03:46.100 --> 03:48.010
<b>Bring me food.</b>

03:49.270 --> 03:52.260
<b><i>Th-This is our King...</i></b>

03:59.730 --> 04:01.050
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

04:01.450 --> 04:02.740
<b>O-Oh, no...</b>

04:02.740 --> 04:05.330
<b>Her organs are severely damaged!</b>

04:23.410 --> 04:25.200
<b>Do not make me repeat myself.</b>

04:26.150 --> 04:28.010
<b>Bring me food.</b>

04:32.060 --> 04:34.200
<b>This is a filthy place...</b>

04:51.160 --> 04:51.970
<b>You...</b>

04:55.260 --> 04:56.230
<b>Clean this off.</b>

05:11.060 --> 05:15.630
<b>Ah, I happen to have a handkerchief on me—</b>

05:19.890 --> 05:21.460
<b>Do not make me repeat myself.</b>

05:21.850 --> 05:23.080
<b>I am speaking to you.</b>

05:24.070 --> 05:25.260
<b>Clean this off.</b>

05:46.250 --> 05:47.330
<b>Disgusting.</b>

05:58.630 --> 06:00.010
<b>Where is my food?</b>

06:00.660 --> 06:02.120
<b>This way, please.</b>

06:05.940 --> 06:08.610
<b>We have prepared a meal for you.</b>

06:09.150 --> 06:12.930
<b>The three of us will serve 
as your arms and legs.</b>

06:13.280 --> 06:16.180
<b>We shall acquire anything you wish...</b>

06:16.780 --> 06:19.810
<b>And fulfill all of your desires.</b>

06:20.400 --> 06:23.310
<b>We await your command.</b>

06:41.050 --> 06:42.750
<b>Help the Queen!</b>

06:43.040 --> 06:44.420
<b>Stop the bleeding!</b>

06:48.310 --> 06:50.050
<b>Well? How is she?</b>

06:50.800 --> 06:52.110
<b>It looks grim...</b>

06:52.110 --> 06:53.600
<b>She's in very bad shape.</b>

06:54.370 --> 07:00.870
<b>Multiple organs have been crushed 
so badly, we cannot heal them!</b>

07:01.480 --> 07:03.360
<b>If something isn't done...</b>

07:11.220 --> 07:12.610
<b>Neferpitou-dono!</b>

07:13.750 --> 07:15.390
<b>The Queen is dying...</b>

07:15.770 --> 07:17.870
<b>We require your assistance!</b>

07:17.870 --> 07:20.600
<b>We need the power you 
used to heal that man!</b>

07:27.020 --> 07:31.500
<b>I only healed him because I need him.</b>

07:32.870 --> 07:34.890
<b>Now that the King has been born,</b>

07:35.310 --> 07:38.390
<b>she means nothing to the Royal Guard.</b>

07:40.880 --> 07:43.650
<b>She is no longer necessary.</b>

07:50.750 --> 07:52.040
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

07:52.040 --> 07:53.960
<b>Your Majesty! Your Majesty!</b>

07:57.310 --> 08:00.640
<b>Well? Will Neferpitou-dono help us?</b>

08:00.990 --> 08:03.130
<b>No, Neferpitou-dono has...</b>

08:03.130 --> 08:04.230
<b>No...</b>

08:04.230 --> 08:06.090
<b>They have all abandoned the Queen.</b>

08:06.280 --> 08:07.880
<b>Abandoned?</b>

08:07.880 --> 08:11.080
<b>We'll have to save the Queen ourselves!</b>

08:11.080 --> 08:12.110
<b>It's impossible!</b>

08:12.110 --> 08:13.590
<b>Weren't you listening to me?</b>

08:13.590 --> 08:15.160
<b>We don't have the power</b>

08:15.160 --> 08:19.210
<b>to heal the damage the Queen has suffered...</b>

08:21.220 --> 08:23.600
<b>Perhaps they have the power we need.</b>

08:24.140 --> 08:25.350
<b>Who are you talking about?</b>

08:26.200 --> 08:28.110
<b>Hey, where are you going?</b>

08:33.320 --> 08:37.400
<b>We have prepared your dinner on the roof, 
where there is a fine view.</b>

08:37.930 --> 08:41.200
<b>Then, it would seem faster 
to get there from outside.</b>

08:48.220 --> 08:49.500
<b>Magnificent...</b>

09:16.030 --> 09:17.160
<b>Excuse me.</b>

09:36.790 --> 09:38.680
<b>That looks fun...</b>

09:52.780 --> 09:54.960
<b>It seems I need practice.</b>

10:12.660 --> 10:13.790
<b>Disgusting.</b>

10:13.790 --> 10:15.540
<b>You don't like it?</b>

10:15.540 --> 10:17.990
<b>It is horrendously bland.</b>

10:17.990 --> 10:21.350
<b>We haven't been seasoning our food...</b>

10:21.350 --> 10:23.600
<b>No, that is not what I mean.</b>

10:24.330 --> 10:26.450
<b>When I was in her belly,</b>

10:26.450 --> 10:31.610
<b>I was occasionally treated to 
wonderfully rich, savory meals.</b>

10:31.970 --> 10:35.360
<b>Ah, you must be talking 
about the rare humans.</b>

10:36.000 --> 10:41.020
<b>My body longs for that 
indescribable satisfaction.</b>

10:41.940 --> 10:43.360
<b>I wish to feast upon one of them.</b>

10:44.580 --> 10:46.120
<b>As you wish.</b>

10:46.540 --> 10:47.470
<b>In that case...</b>

10:59.820 --> 11:02.680
<b>One of them is heading straight for us.</b>

11:02.680 --> 11:04.010
<b>Have we been seen?</b>

11:04.410 --> 11:05.560
<b>Let's hide...</b>

11:05.560 --> 11:06.180
<b>Wait.</b>

11:07.050 --> 11:09.190
<b>Something seems off...</b>

11:09.190 --> 11:10.020
<b>Look!</b>

11:18.480 --> 11:19.990
<b>A white flag?</b>

11:26.260 --> 11:28.040
<b>We surrender!</b>

11:37.210 --> 11:38.970
<b>We surrender!</b>

11:39.630 --> 11:41.050
<b>But there is one condition...</b>

11:41.690 --> 11:43.490
<b>You must save the Queen!</b>

11:43.930 --> 11:46.560
<b>She no longer has the ability to give birth.</b>

11:47.650 --> 11:48.760
<b>The Queen?</b>

11:49.440 --> 11:51.310
<b>The King has already been born!</b>

11:52.190 --> 11:53.330
<b>Impossible!</b>

11:53.330 --> 11:54.560
<b>It's too early!</b>

12:05.990 --> 12:07.000
<b>He is...</b>

12:10.460 --> 12:11.670
<b>They are all</b>

12:13.060 --> 12:14.250
<b>devils...</b>

12:53.510 --> 12:55.010
<b>What is this?</b>

12:56.200 --> 12:58.380
<b>They put up no fight.</b>

13:05.070 --> 13:06.370
<b>Disgusting.</b>

13:06.370 --> 13:07.550
<b>This is all wrong.</b>

13:07.850 --> 13:10.220
<b>Might I offer some advice?</b>

13:10.740 --> 13:13.820
<b>The brain is the most delicious part of a human.</b>

13:14.330 --> 13:18.630
<b>So I'd recommend dispatching your 
prey without harming the head.</b>

13:19.180 --> 13:20.480
<b>Is that so?</b>

13:32.860 --> 13:33.860
<b>Like this?</b>

13:34.400 --> 13:35.680
<b>Magnificent!</b>

13:49.810 --> 13:52.720
<b>I see... This is not so bad.</b>

13:53.750 --> 13:54.730
<b>However...</b>

13:56.260 --> 14:00.480
<b>It is still inedible, 
when compared to a rare human.</b>

14:01.110 --> 14:03.480
<b>Might I offer more advice?</b>

14:04.020 --> 14:06.970
<b>There is a way to identify rare humans.</b>

14:06.970 --> 14:08.070
<b>If you use—</b>

14:11.540 --> 14:13.490
<b>Do you insult me?</b>

14:14.130 --> 14:15.770
<b>I am aware</b>

14:15.770 --> 14:19.780
<b>that if I focus, I can see the 
energy around their bodies.</b>

14:20.120 --> 14:23.000
<b>The volume of energy reveals their strength.</b>

14:25.960 --> 14:28.510
<b>Please forgive my insolence.</b>

14:30.830 --> 14:34.020
<b>Simply finding and consuming 
them is not entertaining.</b>

14:34.480 --> 14:36.160
<b>I enjoy the moments before eating,</b>

14:36.160 --> 14:38.520
<b>before it is clear whether 
the human is rare or not.</b>

14:39.380 --> 14:41.830
<b>Since I have already alleviated my hunger.</b>

14:42.930 --> 14:44.530
<b>Incidentally, Pitou...</b>

14:44.920 --> 14:47.570
<b>You are quite strong.</b>

14:47.910 --> 14:50.120
<b>I was trying to kill you.</b>

14:50.120 --> 14:51.530
<b>You have earned my respect.</b>

14:53.170 --> 14:55.040
<b>I am unworthy.</b>

14:58.020 --> 15:00.540
<b>I don't believe it...</b>

15:01.680 --> 15:04.570
<b>He ate a soldier... One of his own.</b>

15:05.190 --> 15:07.180
<b>That isn't entirely correct.</b>

15:07.830 --> 15:11.550
<b>He is a completely different organism.</b>

15:11.890 --> 15:16.560
<b>I imagine he views all other creatures as food.</b>

15:18.520 --> 15:21.290
<b>So what should we do now?</b>

15:21.800 --> 15:23.240
<b>What do you mean?</b>

15:23.730 --> 15:27.680
<b>If the Queen dies, we'll lose 
our reason to stay here.</b>

15:30.000 --> 15:32.760
<b>Haven't we already lost our reason to stay?</b>

15:33.660 --> 15:37.080
<b>The Queen can no longer reproduce.</b>

15:37.390 --> 15:38.170
<b>Huh?</b>

15:38.790 --> 15:40.130
<b>That's true.</b>

15:42.180 --> 15:45.850
<b>It's no longer possible for the 
Queen to build her kingdom.</b>

15:45.850 --> 15:50.090
<b>In that case, each of us should 
try to become a king...</b>

15:51.480 --> 15:53.590
<b>We can do as we please.</b>

15:53.820 --> 15:57.450
<b>Do you realize what you're saying?</b>

15:57.450 --> 16:00.350
<b>You think you can get away with this?</b>

16:00.640 --> 16:06.360
<b>I'm sure we aren't the only ones 
who'd like to leave this place.</b>

16:18.260 --> 16:19.980
<b>W-Wait...</b>

16:24.160 --> 16:29.580
<b>Now do you see that you're in the minority?</b>

16:32.310 --> 16:34.390
<b>Please... There's no time!</b>

16:34.870 --> 16:36.200
<b>If the Queen dies,</b>

16:36.200 --> 16:38.090
<b>there will be nothing to hold 
the Squadron Leaders back.</b>

16:38.090 --> 16:39.640
<b>Things will spin out of control.</b>

16:39.980 --> 16:41.980
<b>What exactly will happen then?</b>

16:42.720 --> 16:46.150
<b>Most likely, they will imitate the King.</b>

16:47.030 --> 16:51.650
<b>They will leave to build their own 
kingdoms by spreading their seed.</b>

16:52.620 --> 16:54.560
<b>If the chain of command collapses,</b>

16:54.560 --> 16:56.780
<b>some of the Captains will also strike out alone.</b>

16:57.280 --> 17:00.910
<b>They will scatter throughout the world 
and destroy entire ecosystems.</b>

17:01.410 --> 17:05.620
<b>Are Chimera Ant soldiers 
capable of reproduction?</b>

17:05.620 --> 17:06.700
<b>Yes...</b>

17:06.700 --> 17:11.670
<b>They can copulate with females 
of other species and reproduce.</b>

17:12.860 --> 17:15.970
<b>Soldiers belonging to a colony led by a queen</b>

17:15.970 --> 17:18.800
<b>will not attempt to reproduce.</b>

17:19.370 --> 17:20.920
<b>But I've read reports</b>

17:20.920 --> 17:25.770
<b>of soldiers attempting to reproduce 
following a queen's death.</b>

17:27.730 --> 17:31.570
<b>Well, I'd say we can safely assume he isn't lying.</b>

17:34.460 --> 17:36.570
<b>What's your name?</b>

17:37.560 --> 17:38.570
<b>Colt.</b>

17:39.190 --> 17:44.370
<b>Colt, we're going to take you to our boss.</b>

17:45.010 --> 17:48.730
<b>I need you to tell your story to him directly.</b>

17:49.190 --> 17:50.090
<b>However,</b>

17:50.090 --> 17:54.710
<b>I don't know if he will trust you.</b>

17:55.190 --> 17:57.090
<b>And even if he believes your story,</b>

17:57.090 --> 18:00.100
<b>he may not let you leave alive.</b>

18:01.030 --> 18:02.600
<b>Are you still willing to come with us?</b>

18:03.160 --> 18:05.810
<b>Absolutely! Time is of the essence!</b>

18:10.820 --> 18:13.240
<b>The timing couldn't be worse.</b>

18:14.880 --> 18:17.870
<b>Today is the day our disciples fight it out...</b>

18:17.870 --> 18:20.120
<b>Oh! I completely forgot...</b>

18:21.250 --> 18:24.210
<b>I bet 100,000 that Knuckle 
and Shoot would make it.</b>

18:24.790 --> 18:29.150
<b>You bet 1,000,000 that all five would come...</b>

18:57.390 --> 18:58.380
<b>Knuckle...</b>

18:58.380 --> 18:59.150
<b>Huh?</b>

19:08.350 --> 19:09.740
<b>Promise me!</b>

19:09.740 --> 19:10.820
<b>You have to...</b>

19:11.500 --> 19:13.590
<b>You have to save Kite!</b>

19:15.150 --> 19:16.820
<b>Got it...</b>

19:16.820 --> 19:18.670
<b>I promise I'll bring him back.</b>

19:18.860 --> 19:21.670
<b>Rook</b>

19:19.590 --> 19:21.680
<b>I swear on this token.</b>

20:01.560 --> 20:02.670
<b>Killua...</b>

20:05.910 --> 20:08.920
<b>I'm weak...</b>

20:19.680 --> 20:22.660
<b>I never knew...</b>

20:39.290 --> 20:40.750
<b>I never knew</b>

20:42.000 --> 20:43.980
<b>how frustrating</b>

20:44.800 --> 20:46.460
<b>weakness could be!</b>

21:32.670 --> 21:33.580
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

21:35.540 --> 21:38.340
<b><i>For the thirty days that you can't use</i> Nen...</b>

21:39.570 --> 21:41.340
<b><i>I'll protect you.</i></b>

21:42.670 --> 21:46.590
<b><i>I will do whatever it takes!</i></b>

21:49.870 --> 21:51.470
<b><i>After that,</i></b>

21:54.470 --> 21:55.700
<b><i>it's goodbye.</i></b>

23:25.240 --> 23:28.340
<b>Next time: One Wish x And x Two Promises.</b>

23:28.340 --> 23:29.990
<b>Hey, a shooting star!</b>

23:29.990 --> 23:33.180
<b>May we always be together!</b>
