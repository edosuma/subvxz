00:08.965 --> 00:10.532
<i>Previously
on Chapelwaite...</i>

00:10.662 --> 00:11.968
Marcella?

00:12.099 --> 00:13.274
Tell us where you hid
the book...

00:13.404 --> 00:15.624
or I will bleed
the truth from you.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.234
<i>
Phillip and Stephen,</i>

00:17.365 --> 00:18.714
<i>they're to blame
for your wife's illness </i>

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
<i>and for all the others.</i>

00:20.455 --> 00:23.675
I knew they'd become
something truly unholy.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.329
<i>Fighting didn't
chase him off last night. </i>

00:27.549 --> 00:28.724
This did.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.682
The real evil, it's Jakub.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.554
<i>When he comes,
he'll bring the Worm. </i>

00:32.684 --> 00:35.470
All that you believe
is madness...

00:36.688 --> 00:38.777
<i>that is my book, calling you.</i>

00:38.908 --> 00:40.475
<i>If she has fed...</i>

00:40.605 --> 00:41.911
<i>Mary is
no longer your wife. </i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.348
- May God forgive me.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.960
Faith left an hour ago
with her baby.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.528
<i>She hired a coach
to take her to the train. </i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.878
<i>The children told me
about your story. </i>

00:53.009 --> 00:54.837
Pack your things and go.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.273
You hurt us.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.319
I made a terrible mistake.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.321
<i>God,
He offers me His blood </i>

01:00.451 --> 01:02.584
<i>so I will live forever,
in the dark. </i>

01:02.714 --> 01:04.412
How can you be sure Phillip
and Stephen will come tonight?

01:04.542 --> 01:05.717
<i>It was a message.</i>

01:05.848 --> 01:07.415
<i>They left Loa
where I would find her. </i>

01:07.545 --> 01:08.938
<i>They need to suffer
for what they did. </i>

01:09.069 --> 01:11.549
They will.
Stephen?

01:11.680 --> 01:13.769
<i>-What's happened to you?
- I'm one of them. </i>

01:13.899 --> 01:15.379
I don't need my brace anymore.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.467
Hello, cousin.

01:16.598 --> 01:17.903
We know you hear the book.

01:18.034 --> 01:18.817
Bring it to us.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.950
Listen to its cry

01:21.081 --> 01:25.520
and <i>De Vermis Mysteriis
will lead you to it.</i>

01:25.650 --> 01:26.608
We'll be waiting.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.567
Loa!

01:49.457 --> 01:50.632
Loa!

02:26.494 --> 02:27.582
Loa!

02:32.630 --> 02:34.284
Loa?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.725
Loa, why didn't you stop?

02:43.598 --> 02:45.208
You have to mind me.

03:07.012 --> 03:10.451
Blood calls blood, son.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.384
<i>
When the book speaks,</i>

03:30.514 --> 03:33.082
<i>listen to its cry</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:38.783
<i>and De Vermis Mysteriis
will lead you to it.</i>

03:44.789 --> 03:47.227
Where are you?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.361
Answer me!

06:15.766 --> 06:17.551
It's all right, Father!

06:34.219 --> 06:35.873
Loa!

06:36.004 --> 06:37.397
Come to me.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.790
I can't.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.012
I'm so sorry.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.753
I couldn't stop them. I...

06:45.883 --> 06:48.059
- I failed you.
- No.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.887
I wanted this.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.455
You couldn't have.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.635
They took your life!

06:58.766 --> 07:00.594
Stephen's telling the truth.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.639
I can feel it.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.293
Mother's waiting for us all.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.816
We can be a family again.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.079
I want to believe that, too.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.647
More than anything. But...

07:10.778 --> 07:12.693
they're using you, Loa.

07:14.085 --> 07:17.001
You mustn't trust them.
Please.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.613
You're suffering, Father.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.223
I don't like it.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.878
There's no pain here.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.447
They can make that go away.
Don't you want that?

07:29.361 --> 07:30.928
Come to me.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.452
Give me the book,

07:32.582 --> 07:35.803
and we can all be
together again, forever.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.718
You don't understand.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.027
I've seen what the book is.

07:43.158 --> 07:44.942
Stephen told me
it's a new beginning.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.118
He lies.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.773
There is no birth
in their world, Loa.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.995
It's all death in this book.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.910
It's the end...

07:56.040 --> 07:57.477
of everything.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.916
Give me the book.
It doesn't belong to us.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.965
Save Honor and Tane.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.663
Save yourself!

08:09.793 --> 08:11.665
I'm so sorry.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.623
For everything.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.021
You saw the Worm.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.980
The first God.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.329
Now you know.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.896
We have to stop it.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.768
We can't.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.465
- One day it will happen,
- Charles.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.163
The undead will find their book
and free the Worm.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.165
It may be Jakub.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.951
It may be someone
a hundred years from now.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.388
Or it can be us.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.914
You can free a God and
curry its favor. Imagine that.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.395
You can rule
in the coming dark

08:46.526 --> 08:49.006
or you can serve
those who do.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.794
That call in your head
will become unbearable.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.491
There's no honor
in fighting it.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.102
You will break.
The book will win.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.846
Give it willingly
and free yourself!

09:04.326 --> 09:06.546
Free yourself!

09:18.819 --> 09:20.168
No.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.822
No.

12:41.064 --> 12:44.111
He has found the book.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.998
Charles?

13:03.043 --> 13:05.697
My God,
what happened to you?

13:05.828 --> 13:08.222
Where have
you been all night?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.050
I found the book.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.924
Jakub told me if I listened,

13:15.055 --> 13:16.926
it would lead me to it.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.103
You're shivering.
Come inside.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.063
Father!

13:24.107 --> 13:25.935
You're all right!

13:31.419 --> 13:32.942
Where's Loa?

13:34.639 --> 13:37.164
Stephen and Phillip
have her.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.818
Is she like them now?

13:40.297 --> 13:42.169
She is.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.214
What are you holding?

13:48.523 --> 13:50.133
Children...

13:52.440 --> 13:53.658
I need a moment.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.878
Leave me, please...

14:03.712 --> 14:05.975
We'll give you some time.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.239
Rebecca.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.025
Stay.

14:24.820 --> 14:28.302
Jakub told me...

14:28.432 --> 14:30.826
my madness...

14:30.957 --> 14:35.222
and the madness suffered
by every Boone,

14:35.352 --> 14:37.267
is connected to this book.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.532
It's not hereditary
like I thought.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.317
It's--it's this.

14:44.231 --> 14:48.017
Jakub said that if
I returned it to him,

14:48.148 --> 14:51.151
my children and I would...

14:51.281 --> 14:54.284
would be freed
from its curse.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.896
That's <i>De Vermis Mysteriis?</i>

14:58.854 --> 15:01.204
How do you know that?

15:01.335 --> 15:03.467
It was in the letters
I found in the study.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.557
My father brought
Jakub to Maine.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.343
Jakub wanted to buy that book
from your uncle.

15:09.473 --> 15:12.650
My father brokered the meeting
between the two.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.565
There's also
a very good chance

15:14.696 --> 15:18.047
Phillip and Stephen
killed my father because of it.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.444
We...cannot
let them have it.

15:23.574 --> 15:26.969
Why not? If it'll free you and
the children, give it to him.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.538
Do you believe in God?

15:30.668 --> 15:31.931
I do.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.585
If this book...

15:34.716 --> 15:36.936
falls into their hands...

15:39.721 --> 15:41.941
...then God dies.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.512
Give it to me.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.427
- I can hide it for you.
- No.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.345
Nobody goes near this but me.

16:01.264 --> 16:04.224
Why did Father want
to speak to her?

16:05.268 --> 16:06.704
Is he angry with us?

16:06.835 --> 16:08.358
I don't know, Tane.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.986
Phillip and Stephen will come
for this book tonight.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.250
We have to protect it.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.166
Why do they want it?

16:39.650 --> 16:41.261
To bring darkness.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.009
But we won't let them.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.142
We have to keep them
out of the house.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.015
You must help me.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.412
We need planks.
And paint.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.251
Constable?

17:15.382 --> 17:16.470
Hello?

17:24.782 --> 17:26.567
Constable?

17:26.697 --> 17:28.656
It's Able Stewart.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.179
Come in.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.404
Sir, I have a message
from Mr. Boone.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.188
He needs to speak with you.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.668
About what?

17:40.798 --> 17:42.713
We rode to Jerusalem's Lot.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.454
There are people there.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.327
They killed Rose Mallory.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.374
They tried to kill me, too.

17:51.505 --> 17:54.247
- Are they men?
- Men and women, sir.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.075
I asked you...

17:58.642 --> 18:00.340
if they are men.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.604
You know?

18:05.867 --> 18:07.390
How many are there?

18:07.521 --> 18:08.739
I saw five,

18:08.870 --> 18:10.785
but there might be more.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.309
They have followers, too.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.832
Mr. Boone needs your help.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.749
He's hunting Phillip and Stephen
Boone right now at Chapelwaite.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.621
We'll need the minister.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.492
Yeah.
I was going to him next.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.114
Phillip Boone
did this.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.899
Is she one of them?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.292
She is.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.773
Mary sleeps
most of the day.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.558
She fears direct sunlight.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.039
Help me wrap her
in some blankets.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.259
Constable!

18:51.739 --> 18:53.262
Constable!

18:55.699 --> 18:58.267
Constable, come quick!
It's Faith Pringle.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.154
Oh, no, no, no.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.330
Faith.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.462
Faith? No, no!

19:20.681 --> 19:22.552
Whoa! Whoa.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.603
A knife!

19:29.733 --> 19:31.605
A knife, damn you!

19:39.090 --> 19:40.614
Oh, Faith!

19:42.485 --> 19:44.792
Faith.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.968
Oh! Oh! Oh...

19:47.098 --> 19:49.710
Oh, God. Oh.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.496
Where's the baby?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.456
Where is our baby?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.330
What are you looking at?

20:03.767 --> 20:04.725
You judge me?

20:07.945 --> 20:09.730
I have witnessed your sins.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.909
I have heard them all!

20:15.039 --> 20:17.694
How dare you humiliate
my daughter like this!

20:17.825 --> 20:19.696
You're a disgrace!

20:19.827 --> 20:21.785
Behold!

20:21.916 --> 20:23.787
This fraud,

20:23.918 --> 20:26.877
posing as a man of God.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.444
Telling you all
how to live your lives

20:28.575 --> 20:30.838
from his sullied pulpit!

20:30.968 --> 20:34.494
And all the while he was
fornicating with that woman.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.670
Even had a--
a child with her.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.021
Our minister.
Take your whore and go!

20:58.779 --> 21:01.738
That will be enough,
Thompson.

21:01.869 --> 21:05.264
You sure this is the side
you wanna choose, huh?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.615
Move on.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.530
All of ya!

21:18.015 --> 21:20.757
Martin...

21:20.888 --> 21:23.456
come with us.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.675
I have nowhere to go.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.288
We're going to Chapelwaite.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.676
What do you think
is wrong with Father?

22:12.243 --> 22:13.767
Keep painting.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.653
You frightened me.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.614
Is there something
you need?

22:39.967 --> 22:41.882
Do you hear that?

22:43.274 --> 22:44.885
Hear what?

22:48.628 --> 22:49.933
That sound.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.766
I don't hear anything.
What does it sound like?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.379
Someone screaming.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.516
Is it the children?

23:08.865 --> 23:09.910
No.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.868
I fear...

23:54.998 --> 23:56.696
the whaler...

23:56.826 --> 24:00.830
is no better than
his uncle and cousin.

24:02.832 --> 24:06.227
We will go
to Chapelwaite

24:06.357 --> 24:09.622
and take what is ours.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.900
Your father's getting
more boards.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.164
I'd like to speak with you.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.863
We're busy helping
Father prepare.

24:36.866 --> 24:37.867
Charles!

24:40.435 --> 24:42.002
Are you all right?

24:46.789 --> 24:48.530
You're ill, Father.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.664
Let us help you.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.798
Everything is ill.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.934
Nothing is as it seems.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.023
You should rest.
We can finish the work.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.989
Night will be here soon.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.022
Charles?

26:01.168 --> 26:02.691
Charles?

26:06.173 --> 26:07.827
What's wrong?

26:11.047 --> 26:12.571
Charles,
you need to tell me.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.704
The screams in my head.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.577
The cries...

26:23.233 --> 26:25.105
The cries are maddening.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.459
The book wants to be returned.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.461
The book is making you sick.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.158
You need to destroy it!

26:35.289 --> 26:38.031
- Throw it in the fire!
- I tried.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.641
It won't burn.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.731
Show me.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.446
My God.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.753
What is that thing?

27:22.379 --> 27:23.903
I can't stop it.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.080
We're all going to suffer.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.778
Worse than you
could ever imagine.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.695
And what of the children?

27:36.350 --> 27:39.048
Better they die
than to suffer like that.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.923
I want to take
the children and go.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.186
It's not safe for them here.

27:48.928 --> 27:49.972
Where would you go?

27:51.147 --> 27:52.105
Hm?

27:53.802 --> 27:57.719
I'm trying to tell you
there is no escaping it.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.816
I'll decide what to do
with the children.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.572
Honor.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.792
Honor, we need to go now.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.489
Where's Father?

28:28.619 --> 28:31.231
I don't know. I'm taking you
to town. It's safer there.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.580
We're not going anywhere
with you.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.147
We're not leaving Father.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.975
I know you don't
trust me right now,

28:36.105 --> 28:37.890
but you need
to listen to me.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.587
Your father is not well.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.981
That book has corrupted him,

28:42.111 --> 28:44.157
and I'm afraid
he might do us harm.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.636
You're lying.
He would never hurt us.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.334
We don't have time
for this now.

28:47.464 --> 28:50.032
Find Tane. I'm going
to get the carriage, okay?

29:03.132 --> 29:05.004
Charles!

29:05.134 --> 29:06.919
What were you
doing in there?

29:07.049 --> 29:09.356
I let the horses go.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.575
Why would you do that?

29:11.706 --> 29:13.969
It's not safe.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.884
No one can leave.

29:42.389 --> 29:43.956
Honor! Tane!

29:44.086 --> 29:45.218
In here.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.699
We thought you left.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.311
Not without you.
Where's your father?

29:51.441 --> 29:52.616
He was just here.

29:52.747 --> 29:55.010
He went to the cellar.
He said he'd call for us.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.099
He was whispering
to himself.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.362
- I'm scared.
- It's all right.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.016
You were right.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.975
Something's
very wrong with him.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.107
- Yes.
- Did you get the carriage?

30:07.109 --> 30:09.024
He let the horses go.

30:09.155 --> 30:11.070
Is he going to hurt us?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.985
Honor! Tane!

30:13.115 --> 30:14.551
Come down here!

30:14.682 --> 30:16.205
What do we do?

30:17.772 --> 30:19.295
Get a weapon. Here.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.388
Take this.
Go to your room, lock the door.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.347
If he calls for you again,
don't answer.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.305
- Rebecca...
- It's all right. Go.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.785
Go on.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.961
Just remember
what I told you. Go.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.398
Charles?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.206
Charles?

31:50.691 --> 31:52.040
Charles.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.738
Oh, God.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.262
You're not enough.

31:56.392 --> 31:59.308
It's the book.
This isn't you.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.446
Oh God.

32:06.576 --> 32:10.232
All we've done
won't be enough.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.933
If we survive the night,
they'll keep coming.

32:16.630 --> 32:17.718
Lions to cattle.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.198
Charles.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.331
Please let us go.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.208
I've seen the order unravel.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.256
The new world belongs to them.

32:37.042 --> 32:40.088
I won't have my children
serve, suffer.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.831
I won't leave them
to that future.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.486
Charles,
please don't do this.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.357
My father knew.

32:50.359 --> 32:53.493
He tried to save me
from this fate.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.237
I hated him for what he did.

33:00.630 --> 33:04.112
I never understood until now.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.159
It's the only way.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.032
The only way to save us.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.255
Don't be afraid.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.170
- Shh. Don't.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.526
I'll call them now.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.529
We'll all go together.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.837
Children!

33:33.968 --> 33:36.188
Charles, you're right.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.146
I understand.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.019
I'll bring the children.

33:42.977 --> 33:45.197
You're right.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.155
It's the only way.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.158
Oh, thank you.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.077
Don't frighten them.

33:57.383 --> 33:58.514
No.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.083
Good.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.160
What is this?

34:35.290 --> 34:37.597
How do you feel?

34:37.727 --> 34:38.902
The children...

34:39.033 --> 34:40.469
They're all right.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.604
And they must never know
what I saw in the basement.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.216
Thank you.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.741
I need to believe
that wasn't you.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.484
It was the book.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.751
It overwhelmed me.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.710
It stole all reason.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.365
The horrible things
it showed...

35:09.019 --> 35:10.760
Where is it?

35:10.891 --> 35:12.632
You said the only way
to be rid of your curse

35:12.762 --> 35:13.676
was to return it
to the undead.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.417
What?

35:15.548 --> 35:17.767
- That's what I did.
- You didn't give it to them!

35:17.898 --> 35:19.334
It's all right.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.031
<i>It's with Mary Dennison.</i>

35:21.162 --> 35:24.339
<i>She's restrained
in the cellar. </i>

35:24.470 --> 35:26.124
She's one of them now.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.651
Able Stewart brought them.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.002
If I think
for one second

35:35.133 --> 35:37.135
that you're a danger
to anyone...

35:38.353 --> 35:39.702
I understand.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.445
I'm grateful to you all.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.579
The book
with Mary Dennison,

35:46.709 --> 35:49.538
what do these vampires
want with it?

35:49.669 --> 35:53.455
They mean to raise
an old god.

35:53.586 --> 35:56.545
I had a vision
when I opened it.

35:56.676 --> 36:00.680
I saw...the terrible
future it holds.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.727
Eternal night.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.555
The undead rule...

36:09.123 --> 36:11.778
...and man is meat.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.823
How did you come by
such an evil thing?

36:22.615 --> 36:23.572
Forgive me.

36:25.618 --> 36:28.751
Forgive me. I--I...

36:28.882 --> 36:31.798
I found it
in your children's grave.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.715
It was buried with them.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.417
I am so very sorry.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.376
Nothing grew on that grave.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.423
Freshly laid flowers, grass...

36:48.554 --> 36:50.208
weeds.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.601
All rotted.

36:56.605 --> 36:57.998
Marcella Boone
must have hidden it

36:58.128 --> 37:00.783
in the coffin
at the viewing.

37:08.704 --> 37:11.229
My cousin and uncle...

37:14.188 --> 37:15.624
they'll come.

38:06.849 --> 38:07.894
Oh!

38:08.024 --> 38:09.896
Dear God.

38:10.766 --> 38:12.855
What have they done
to you, child?

38:12.986 --> 38:14.379
We saved her.

38:14.509 --> 38:17.556
You don't save.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.036
You murder.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.735
Go away, woman.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.737
Turn your back.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.305
No, I've done that
for too long now.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.439
May God forgive me
for doing so.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.640
What's your plan, Mr. Boone?

38:59.859 --> 39:00.860
We survive.

39:02.775 --> 39:03.689
We boarded
the upstairs windows

39:03.819 --> 39:06.256
and painted the second story.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.476
And what do we do
after tonight?

39:09.695 --> 39:12.654
Oh, my God.
Hunt them by day.

39:14.656 --> 39:15.918
I shot Stephen.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.660
Lead is useless.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.928
Anyone know how
to kill these things?

39:26.059 --> 39:27.147
Fire?

39:27.277 --> 39:28.540
Steel?

39:28.670 --> 39:30.411
We don't know.

39:32.152 --> 39:33.414
Then we'll learn.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.504
Gentlemen...

39:38.114 --> 39:39.986
My daughter Loa,

39:40.116 --> 39:41.770
she may be
among them tonight.

39:43.642 --> 39:44.860
She's not to be harmed.

39:44.991 --> 39:46.645
Of course.

39:47.646 --> 39:48.821
Thank you.

39:55.828 --> 39:56.916
Excuse me.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.627
The house is secure.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.934
We should
hold the night.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.896
I have no solution
for our long-term future,

40:21.027 --> 40:21.941
but I will find one.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.944
And I will bring Loa home.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.732
I'm so sorry...

40:32.212 --> 40:33.082
for frightening you.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.562
I wasn't myself.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.174
I hope you can forgive me.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.699
Will you ever
be that way again?

40:43.179 --> 40:44.833
Never.

40:45.834 --> 40:48.924
This wouldn't have happened
if we stayed at sea.

40:49.055 --> 40:52.711
Well, the madness would
have found me, regardless.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.844
It found my father,
far from here.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.153
When the time is right,

41:00.283 --> 41:02.460
there are things I need
to tell you about our family.

41:03.504 --> 41:04.636
What about the woman
in the cellar?

41:04.766 --> 41:06.594
What if she gets out?

41:08.248 --> 41:09.858
I won't let her harm you.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.480
I'm sorry, children.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.053
Go and see if Mr. Dennison
needs anything.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.492
Go help your sister.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.760
You seem much improved.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.632
I feel better.

41:47.243 --> 41:48.506
Rebecca...

41:50.551 --> 41:52.248
What you did for me
and my family--

41:52.379 --> 41:53.902
You don't need
to say anything.

41:54.033 --> 41:55.034
No. I do.

41:57.558 --> 42:00.387
I told you to leave
and you stayed.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.041
You put your life in danger.

42:04.086 --> 42:05.523
You saved us.

42:06.828 --> 42:08.787
I love your children.

42:08.917 --> 42:11.920
I never should've broken
their trust.

42:12.051 --> 42:13.356
Or yours.

42:13.487 --> 42:15.228
That's behind us.

42:15.358 --> 42:16.925
Let's not speak of it again.

42:20.363 --> 42:23.671
What you told me about
your father and my relatives...

42:26.282 --> 42:28.284
if they hurt him, I'm sorry.

42:28.415 --> 42:31.592
Whatever happened to my father,
he brought upon himself,

42:31.723 --> 42:34.247
and us.

42:34.377 --> 42:36.379
My family is every bit
as responsible as yours

42:36.510 --> 42:37.380
for the evil we face.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.861
But you are not.

42:39.992 --> 42:41.080
Nor am I.

42:43.604 --> 42:45.954
Neither of us deserves
this burden.

42:57.313 --> 42:59.141
Oh, Lord,
we ask that You bless

42:59.272 --> 43:01.056
and sanctify this home

43:01.187 --> 43:04.059
as You blessed the homes
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

43:04.190 --> 43:06.192
May Your light and angels
fill this dwelling.

43:06.322 --> 43:08.281
We ask that You
protect this house

43:08.411 --> 43:10.109
and all who dwell within.

43:10.239 --> 43:12.154
In Jesus' name,
we pray. Amen.

43:13.895 --> 43:14.983
Amen.

43:16.463 --> 43:20.249
I've blessed every room
in the house.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.600
Well, surely
God stands with us.

43:24.863 --> 43:25.907
Which God?

43:27.517 --> 43:29.737
There seems to be
a choice these days.

43:32.044 --> 43:34.394
I am not sure that
our God exists at all.

43:34.524 --> 43:36.483
Martin,
that's grief speaking.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.616
I've buried two children...

43:40.008 --> 43:41.619
and the woman that I love.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.883
All of them, innocents.

43:46.406 --> 43:47.929
I betrayed my wife,

43:48.060 --> 43:50.149
I've ruined what little
remained of her.

43:51.977 --> 43:54.936
Yet I, a blackguard
and a liar, I live?

43:57.722 --> 43:59.898
Where is God's love
in that design?

44:01.421 --> 44:03.684
I'm sorry about Faith.

44:04.946 --> 44:06.774
And your child.

44:07.862 --> 44:09.124
Thank you.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.171
There's not many
that would see their way

44:12.301 --> 44:13.215
to sympathy for them.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.835
Father says
we should all eat.

44:34.193 --> 44:35.847
Thank you.

44:40.590 --> 44:42.114
Minister...

44:46.640 --> 44:49.730
We believe our mother
is waiting for us in Heaven.

44:51.514 --> 44:53.212
One day we'll be reunited.

44:56.998 --> 44:58.696
My sister, Loa...

45:00.828 --> 45:03.178
Will these undead
find their way to Heaven?

45:05.485 --> 45:07.705
- I...
- She's good.

45:09.489 --> 45:11.099
She made a mistake.

45:13.275 --> 45:15.147
I'm sure she is.

45:17.192 --> 45:19.238
We all make mistakes.

45:19.368 --> 45:22.720
God knows...
we're not perfect.

45:25.026 --> 45:26.549
He gave us free will,

45:26.680 --> 45:28.900
knowing that we would
make poor decisions

45:29.030 --> 45:30.249
from time to time.

45:32.251 --> 45:33.513
And I am sure that
when it comes time

45:33.643 --> 45:35.341
for your sister
to pass over,

45:35.471 --> 45:39.911
that God will make a place
in Heaven for her.

45:43.479 --> 45:44.916
Thank you.

46:45.846 --> 46:48.196
What are you peeking at,
silly man?

46:49.676 --> 46:52.070
I didn't see anything.
I swear.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.202
That's because you're
too far away.

46:56.422 --> 46:57.902
No, no, no, no!

46:58.032 --> 46:58.946
Please, please!

46:59.077 --> 47:00.295
Please! No!

47:08.826 --> 47:12.351
Who do you pray to, farmer?

47:12.481 --> 47:13.482
Help me.

47:13.613 --> 47:15.354
Help me, please!

47:15.484 --> 47:17.269
Help me! Help me!

48:09.799 --> 48:11.627
Where am I?

48:11.758 --> 48:13.499
Chapelwaite.

48:13.629 --> 48:15.457
Why?

48:15.588 --> 48:17.895
We're gonna stop Stephen
and Phillip Boone.

48:19.461 --> 48:21.289
I'm gonna kill Phillip
for hurting you.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.339
You hurt me.

48:28.775 --> 48:31.909
These hurt me.

48:33.301 --> 48:34.476
They're for your protection.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.089
And for the protection
of others.

48:38.219 --> 48:39.917
Let me out of here!

48:50.753 --> 48:52.973
Don't you love me anymore?

48:54.932 --> 48:58.587
If you love me,
you'll feed me.

48:58.718 --> 49:00.938
Give me your blood.

49:02.678 --> 49:04.419
I'm hungry.

49:06.682 --> 49:11.513
So hungry.

49:55.905 --> 49:57.255
No.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.475
Why did you stop?

50:00.606 --> 50:04.218
They're here!
They're just outside the gate!

50:26.936 --> 50:29.548
An ill choice, nephew!

50:29.678 --> 50:32.812
Do you think this will stop us
from taking the book?

50:32.942 --> 50:36.468
How long can you
fight it, Charles?

50:36.598 --> 50:40.211
This is your last chance!
End your suffering!

50:40.341 --> 50:42.082
And your children's!

50:43.040 --> 50:46.217
Charles Boone! Answer us!

50:46.347 --> 50:50.351
Give us the book!

50:50.482 --> 50:51.439
Come out!

50:52.701 --> 50:55.356
Or I swear I'll--Ah!

51:00.622 --> 51:01.841
Aah!

51:01.971 --> 51:03.712
Now!

51:03.843 --> 51:05.497
- Father!

51:12.504 --> 51:14.332
- Reset! Forward!

51:16.421 --> 51:18.553
- Heave!

51:18.684 --> 51:19.598
Father!

51:33.916 --> 51:35.222
Father!

51:36.615 --> 51:37.485
Kill them!

51:42.403 --> 51:44.101
Kill them all!

52:21.094 --> 52:22.661
Damn your blood.

52:24.358 --> 52:25.664
Father!

52:32.888 --> 52:35.326
No!

52:45.988 --> 52:48.295
I will bleed you dry, cousin.

52:48.426 --> 52:49.688
All of you.

53:07.532 --> 53:09.360
Oh, dear God.

53:10.883 --> 53:12.798
Is it over?

53:12.928 --> 53:14.452
Not yet.

53:15.627 --> 53:16.758
It's Jakub.

53:18.151 --> 53:20.371
Able, ride for town.

53:20.501 --> 53:21.763
Try to get help.

53:21.894 --> 53:23.809
I believe I'm of
more use here, sir.

53:23.939 --> 53:25.898
You saw them
in Jerusalem's Lot.

53:26.028 --> 53:27.334
You know
how many there are.

53:28.596 --> 53:29.597
Please.

53:30.685 --> 53:32.252
Yes, sir.
