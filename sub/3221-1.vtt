00:12.993 --> 00:14.368
<i>This thing goes our way...</i>

00:14.536 --> 00:16.493
<i>and I triple-lindy into that box...</i>

00:18.206 --> 00:20.329
<i>you know I'm not coming back.</i>

00:26.339 --> 00:29.257
<i>You gotta promise
not to try to bring me back.</i>

00:29.468 --> 00:34.379
<i>You go find Lisa.
You go live some normal apple-pie life.</i>

00:34.556 --> 00:36.383
<i>Promise me, Dean.</i>

00:36.558 --> 00:38.100
<i>Promise me.</i>

00:48.028 --> 00:51.397
<i>He wants to dream like a young man</i>

00:52.324 --> 00:55.657
<i>With the wisdom of an old man</i>

00:57.204 --> 00:58.947
You okay?

00:59.873 --> 01:00.904
Yeah, I'm good.

01:01.082 --> 01:04.665
<i>He wants to live like a sailor at sea</i>

03:24.142 --> 03:26.764
Thank God this is before Facebook.

03:26.937 --> 03:31.148
- Me and that goat all over the Internet.
- Oh. Ha, ha. That's right.

03:31.316 --> 03:32.976
So don't get me wrong, no complaints.

03:33.151 --> 03:34.895
But if you had said to me:

03:35.070 --> 03:38.273
"Hey, you, 15 years from now?
Suburbia."

03:38.448 --> 03:39.907
Oh, yeah. Right?

03:40.075 --> 03:41.818
Believe me, I know.

03:41.993 --> 03:44.781
So you traveled around a lot, huh?
Mm-hm.

03:44.955 --> 03:46.532
Yeah, my whole life, pretty much.

03:50.168 --> 03:51.662
- And...?
- Ha, ha.

03:51.837 --> 03:53.461
I don't know.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.089
Come on. You-

03:55.257 --> 03:58.341
What, you moved in, what,
about a year ago?

03:58.510 --> 03:59.589
Yeah, thereabouts.

03:59.761 --> 04:03.545
So I've been buying you beer
for a year.

04:03.807 --> 04:06.013
I think that means you owe me
gory details.

04:06.184 --> 04:09.719
Oh, no. There's not much to tell,
you know? It's, uh-

04:10.313 --> 04:12.520
Lived on the road...

04:12.983 --> 04:16.434
took crap jobs
that nobody else wanted.

04:16.945 --> 04:19.269
- Like?
- Like...

04:20.365 --> 04:21.444
pest control.

04:21.616 --> 04:23.241
Really?

04:24.161 --> 04:26.616
Pest control? Yeah.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.580
Get to work with a partner.

04:28.748 --> 04:31.418
You get to help people.

04:32.419 --> 04:35.539
You have no idea
what's in some people's walls.

04:35.714 --> 04:36.994
It could eat them alive.

04:37.966 --> 04:39.246
Yeesh.

04:39.426 --> 04:41.964
Of course, that was then and now...

04:42.971 --> 04:46.091
- You're practically respectable.
- Psh. Yeah, wow.

04:46.558 --> 04:47.637
I guess so.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.051
That's kind of scary, actually.
Ha, ha.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.936
Thanks, guys.

04:52.105 --> 04:53.932
Thank you.

04:54.107 --> 04:56.645
- I think she likes you.
- You think?

05:00.489 --> 05:03.988
What is it with you? Like, every time.

05:04.159 --> 05:07.859
It's like chicks specifically dig
unavailable guys.

05:09.247 --> 05:10.279
Who knew?

05:14.336 --> 05:16.245
Okay.

05:16.421 --> 05:17.963
- See you tomorrow.
- I'll see you.

05:18.131 --> 05:20.669
- Okay.
- Thanks, man.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.856
<i>No one's called about a missing person?</i>

07:44.528 --> 07:46.769
No, this would have been today.

07:47.572 --> 07:50.692
So no reports of anything
around Vineland and Oak Street?

07:50.867 --> 07:53.109
Near that hotel renovation?

07:55.831 --> 07:58.404
Uh... Yeah, call it a hunch.

07:58.583 --> 08:01.869
I've been a cop for a long time.

08:04.506 --> 08:06.499
Okay. Yeah.
No, I'll call you tomorrow.

08:06.675 --> 08:08.963
You too, man. Bye.

08:10.554 --> 08:12.012
Hey.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.425
Who was that?

08:13.598 --> 08:15.887
Sid. I'm just setting up
a poker game.

08:16.977 --> 08:18.222
It's 11:30.

08:19.521 --> 08:21.229
Is it really?

08:21.523 --> 08:23.599
Explains why he was asleep
when I called.

08:25.110 --> 08:26.485
I'll be right up.

08:27.571 --> 08:29.148
Okay.

10:21.601 --> 10:23.261
Dean? Is that a gun?

10:23.979 --> 10:27.679
No. Yeah. Well, I got a permit for it.

10:28.483 --> 10:30.808
What, to shoot the Glickmans' dog?

10:33.280 --> 10:34.738
I thought that was a possum.

10:36.158 --> 10:41.282
Remember I said I was in pest control?
Well, possums carry rabies, so:

10:43.373 --> 10:45.413
- I did not know that.
- Oh, yeah.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.126
Yeah, possums...

10:47.294 --> 10:49.286
Possums kill, Sid.

10:50.505 --> 10:51.750
Oh, crap.

10:52.841 --> 10:54.549
What's that?

10:59.306 --> 11:01.097
Sulfur.

11:02.058 --> 11:04.051
- I gotta go.
- Hold on, Dean.

11:04.227 --> 11:05.342
What the hell?

11:33.006 --> 11:34.548
Hey.

11:35.801 --> 11:36.880
Just getting a hammer.

11:38.929 --> 11:40.921
So I just ran into Sid.

11:43.642 --> 11:45.266
Did you almost shoot a yorkie?

11:46.520 --> 11:47.718
Technically.

11:48.230 --> 11:50.353
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

11:50.524 --> 11:52.101
How come I don't believe you?

11:54.277 --> 11:56.519
I just-I, uh-I got this-

11:56.696 --> 11:58.606
I don't know, spidey-sense.

11:59.116 --> 12:01.488
Okay. Are you hunting something?

12:02.035 --> 12:03.779
Honestly?

12:04.412 --> 12:06.204
At first, I thought that I was...

12:06.373 --> 12:09.908
but I'm pretty sure
that I got worked up over nothing.

12:10.669 --> 12:12.044
It's, uh-You know...

12:12.879 --> 12:14.836
it happens.

12:16.091 --> 12:17.170
Are you sure?

12:20.262 --> 12:23.962
I'll tell you what. Because, you know,
I have an OCD thing about this...

12:24.141 --> 12:26.382
why don't you and Ben
go to the movies?

12:27.352 --> 12:30.602
Hit the Cheesecake Factory,
hang out with the teeming masses...

12:30.772 --> 12:35.315
and I'll do one last sweep
just to be a hundred percent.

12:37.237 --> 12:38.815
Okay.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.612
- Be careful.
- Careful is my middle name.

14:00.195 --> 14:02.104
Hi, Dean.

14:02.447 --> 14:04.903
Look what the apocalypse
shook loose.

14:07.536 --> 14:10.987
You have fun sniffing that trail?

14:11.164 --> 14:13.786
Because I sure had fun
batting you around.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.073
You can't be-

14:15.252 --> 14:16.532
Oh, sure, I can.

14:16.711 --> 14:18.538
- No.
- Yeah, kiddo.

14:18.713 --> 14:21.251
The big daddy
brought your pal Cass back, right?

14:21.424 --> 14:23.084
So why not me?

14:23.260 --> 14:26.711
Add a little spice to all that sugar.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.054
Really?

14:33.228 --> 14:35.517
After all we've been through together?

14:37.357 --> 14:40.192
You know,
you got a great little life here.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.649
Pretty lady. Real understanding.

14:42.821 --> 14:44.813
Hell of a kid. Ha, ha.

14:45.115 --> 14:48.032
And how do you keep your lawn
so green?

14:48.326 --> 14:51.992
I mean, come on, Dean.
You've never been what I'd call brainy...

14:52.164 --> 14:55.996
but did you really think
you were gonna get to keep all of this?

14:56.168 --> 14:58.919
You had to know that we were
coming for you sometime, pal.

15:00.922 --> 15:02.037
Hmm.

15:04.009 --> 15:06.297
You can't outrun your past.

15:31.036 --> 15:32.115
Hey, Dean.

15:39.127 --> 15:40.290
I was expecting, uh...

15:41.213 --> 15:42.837
I don't know, a hug...

15:43.006 --> 15:45.378
some holy water in the face,
something.

15:47.260 --> 15:49.300
- So I'm dead?
- Ha, ha.

15:49.471 --> 15:51.179
This is heaven?

15:51.681 --> 15:53.840
- Yellow Eyes killed me, and-
- Yellow Eyes?

15:54.017 --> 15:55.180
That's what you saw?

15:55.602 --> 15:56.681
Saw?

15:56.853 --> 15:58.134
You were poisoned.

15:58.313 --> 16:02.145
So whatever kind of crazy crap you think
you've been seeing, it's not real.

16:08.740 --> 16:11.362
So then are you real?

16:11.535 --> 16:13.029
- Or am I still-?
- I'm real.

16:14.538 --> 16:17.907
Um-Here.
Let me save you the trouble.

16:42.232 --> 16:44.640
All me. That's nasty.

16:55.162 --> 16:56.241
Sammy?

16:57.038 --> 16:59.446
Yeah. It's me.

17:19.728 --> 17:23.262
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You were gone. I mean, that was it.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.898
- How did you-?
- I don't know.

17:25.066 --> 17:28.850
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I mean, no idea. I'm just back.

17:29.112 --> 17:32.232
Well, was it God? Or Cass?
Does Cass know anything about it?

17:32.407 --> 17:36.191
You tell me. Cass hasn't answered
my prayers. I don't know where he is.

17:36.787 --> 17:38.660
I mean, I was down there.

17:38.830 --> 17:42.662
And then next minute, it's raining
and I'm lying in that field, alone.

17:44.252 --> 17:47.668
It's hard to look for whatever saved you
when you got no leads...

17:47.839 --> 17:52.003
but I looked.
I mean, believe me. I looked.

17:52.385 --> 17:53.465
For weeks.

17:57.766 --> 17:59.675
Wait, weeks?

18:00.769 --> 18:02.808
How long have you been back?

18:04.439 --> 18:07.310
- How long have you been back, Sam?
- About a year.

18:07.484 --> 18:09.061
- About a year?
- Dean-

18:09.236 --> 18:12.355
You've been back
practically this whole time?

18:12.531 --> 18:15.200
What, did you lose the ability
to send a text message?

18:15.367 --> 18:18.487
- You finally had what you wanted.
- I wanted my brother, alive.

18:18.662 --> 18:22.529
You wanted a family. For a long time.
Maybe the whole time. I know you.

18:22.707 --> 18:25.245
You only gave it up
because of the way we lived.

18:25.418 --> 18:27.707
You had something,
you were building something.

18:27.879 --> 18:32.126
Had I shown up, Dean,
you would've just run off.

18:33.885 --> 18:35.427
I'm sorry.

18:35.595 --> 18:40.756
But it felt like after everything,
you deserved some regular life.

18:48.942 --> 18:51.729
- What have you been doing?
- Hunting.

18:55.115 --> 18:57.072
You left me alone
and were flying solo?

18:57.242 --> 18:58.617
- Not solo.
- What?

18:58.785 --> 19:01.537
- I hooked up with some people.
- You? With strangers?

19:01.705 --> 19:03.496
They're more like family.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.832
And they're here.

19:23.518 --> 19:25.392
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:27.397 --> 19:30.433
My God, you have
delicate features for a hunter.

19:30.609 --> 19:33.182
- Excuse me?
- Dean, Gwen Campbell.

19:33.361 --> 19:35.650
Good to finally meet you.
Sam's gone on and on.

19:35.822 --> 19:37.198
And this is Christian...

19:39.034 --> 19:41.572
and Mark. Campbell.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.788
Hi.

19:45.957 --> 19:48.627
- Cam-Campbell, like-
- Like your mom.

19:50.545 --> 19:52.704
Third cousin, third cousin-

19:52.881 --> 19:55.633
Something-something, twice removed.
Grew up in the life.

19:55.801 --> 19:57.627
Like Mom. Like us.

19:57.803 --> 20:01.006
I thought all of Mom's relatives
were gone.

20:02.933 --> 20:06.977
I'm sorry, it's just, you know,
why didn't we know about any of you?

20:07.145 --> 20:09.470
Because they didn't know about you.

20:13.693 --> 20:15.816
Not until I brought you all together.

20:15.987 --> 20:18.609
Samuel? Come here.

20:19.449 --> 20:21.027
I'm your grandfather.

20:31.294 --> 20:34.212
Guys, give me a second
with my grandsons here, please.

20:43.431 --> 20:47.381
A lot of resurrections in your face today.
It's all right, take a minute.

20:47.561 --> 20:49.849
This is gonna take
a little more than a minute.

20:50.021 --> 20:52.061
I mean, what the hell?
How did this happen?

20:52.649 --> 20:55.354
We're guessing whatever pulled Sam up
pulled me down.

20:55.527 --> 20:58.812
- Whatever this is, we're part of it.
- You don't know what that is.

20:58.989 --> 21:00.862
Bingo.

21:01.241 --> 21:04.195
And you have no leads? Nothing?

21:05.078 --> 21:06.987
Well, this-This is, uh-

21:09.833 --> 21:12.324
No more doornails coming
out of that door, is there?

21:12.502 --> 21:14.625
As far as we know,
it's Samuel and it's me.

21:18.175 --> 21:22.468
Okay, am I the only one here
that thinks this can't all just be fine?

21:22.637 --> 21:23.882
Believe me, you're not.

21:26.141 --> 21:27.635
I wanted to come get you.

21:27.809 --> 21:30.810
Sam was adamant about leaving you out.
So we did.

21:31.396 --> 21:32.677
Until this.

21:34.232 --> 21:37.482
Right. So then you ended up
in my garage, how?

21:37.652 --> 21:40.060
I got hit before you did, few days ago.

21:40.238 --> 21:41.780
Dosed up with poison.

21:41.948 --> 21:43.573
- By?
- Couple of Djinn.

21:43.742 --> 21:45.781
Djinn. I thought those were-

21:45.952 --> 21:48.823
Were cave-dwelling hermit-types.
That's pretty exotic.

21:48.997 --> 21:52.532
Not anymore, at least. These look like
regular people. They can blend in.

21:52.709 --> 21:54.868
All they gotta do to kill you
is touch you.

21:55.045 --> 21:56.788
Their toxins get in your system...

21:56.963 --> 21:59.751
you're hallucinating
your worst nightmares and you OD.

21:59.925 --> 22:03.009
- Well, then how are you breathing air?
- Samuel had a cure.

22:03.970 --> 22:05.513
You got a cure for Djinn poison?

22:05.680 --> 22:06.925
Oh, I know a few things.

22:07.098 --> 22:10.633
Stick around, I'll show you tricks
your daddy never even dreamed of.

22:12.395 --> 22:13.594
Uh...

22:13.772 --> 22:17.604
- Okay, why are these things after us?
- Well, you did stake one a while back.

22:18.110 --> 22:19.936
After they came after me...

22:20.112 --> 22:23.563
we were pretty certain that they were
gonna go gunning for you next.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.824
Lisa and Ben. They're at the house,
if that thing comes back-

22:26.993 --> 22:28.951
I sent someone over there
to watch them.

22:29.121 --> 22:30.319
You gotta take me home.

22:38.755 --> 22:40.547
Lisa?

22:40.715 --> 22:42.625
Lisa. Ben?

22:47.180 --> 22:48.924
Ben!

23:15.750 --> 23:16.782
Come on, come on.

23:19.212 --> 23:20.244
Hey, there you are.

23:20.422 --> 23:23.506
- Where have you been?
- We were at the movies, you knew that.

23:24.551 --> 23:26.045
Dean. Ow.

23:26.845 --> 23:29.134
What happened?
Go upstairs and pack a bag.

23:29.306 --> 23:31.215
- Where are we going?
- Friend's house.

23:31.391 --> 23:33.929
It's okay, go on up.
I'll be there in a sec.

23:37.647 --> 23:38.976
Um...

23:41.777 --> 23:43.734
Oh, my God.

23:44.237 --> 23:47.072
- Lisa, I don't know if you remember-
- Sam.

23:56.166 --> 23:57.245
Damn it.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.785
It's good to see you too.
It's been a while.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.080
If you're here, something's wrong.

24:03.215 --> 24:06.833
- Bobby, this is Lisa and Ben.
- Hi.

24:07.385 --> 24:10.221
Well, it's nice to finally meet you two.

24:11.097 --> 24:13.470
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

24:13.642 --> 24:15.634
Maybe you wanna just go upstairs.

24:15.811 --> 24:19.429
<i>TV's broken,
but there's plenty of Reader's Digest.</i>

24:20.857 --> 24:22.850
Just don't touch the decor, okay?

24:23.026 --> 24:24.568
Assume it's all loaded.

24:26.655 --> 24:28.315
So...

24:30.408 --> 24:32.152
Hey, Bobby.

24:32.911 --> 24:34.026
Sam.

24:43.630 --> 24:47.628
You knew? You knew Sam was alive?

24:47.801 --> 24:49.129
Yeah.

24:51.263 --> 24:52.543
How long? Look-

24:52.722 --> 24:53.921
How long?

24:55.725 --> 24:56.805
All year.

25:01.314 --> 25:03.603
You gotta be kidding me.
And I'd do it again.

25:03.775 --> 25:05.982
- Why?
- Because you got out, Dean.

25:06.153 --> 25:07.813
You walked away from the life...

25:07.988 --> 25:11.273
and I was so damn grateful
you got no idea.

25:11.450 --> 25:14.071
Do you have any clue
what walking away meant for me?

25:14.244 --> 25:16.533
Yeah. A woman and a kid...

25:16.705 --> 25:19.825
and not getting your guts ripped out
at age 30, that's what.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.158
I went to them
because you asked me to.

25:22.335 --> 25:23.580
- Good.
- Good for who?

25:23.753 --> 25:27.621
I showed up on their doorstep
half out of my head with grief.

25:27.799 --> 25:31.927
God knows why they even let me in.
I drank too much, I had nightmares.

25:32.387 --> 25:33.965
I looked everywhere.

25:34.139 --> 25:37.638
I collected hundreds of books,
trying to find anything to bust you out.

25:37.809 --> 25:41.854
- You promised you'd leave it alone.
- Of course I didn't. Sue me.

25:42.063 --> 25:44.056
A damn year...

25:44.983 --> 25:46.892
you couldn't put me
out of my misery?

25:47.402 --> 25:51.649
Look, I get it wasn't easy,
but that's life.

25:51.823 --> 25:55.572
And it's as close to happiness
as I've ever seen a hunter get.

25:57.412 --> 25:59.321
Ain't like I wanted to lie to you, son.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.246
But you were out, Dean.

26:02.417 --> 26:04.457
Do I look out to you?

26:14.429 --> 26:15.758
How's he doing?

26:15.931 --> 26:18.219
He's okay. How are you?

26:21.895 --> 26:24.351
I know Bobby's a little crotchety,
but he's great.

26:24.523 --> 26:27.856
He's gonna look after you guys.
Me and Sam, we're gonna head out.

26:30.946 --> 26:32.191
Mm.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.782
For how long?

26:41.123 --> 26:42.498
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

26:42.958 --> 26:45.449
- For what?
- Those things were coming for me...

26:45.627 --> 26:47.002
and I should've known.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.412
How could you know a monster
was gonna show up?

26:49.589 --> 26:53.338
I should've known that if I stayed
with you, that something would come...

26:53.510 --> 26:55.253
because something always does.

26:55.428 --> 26:58.180
But I was stupid and reckless...

26:59.432 --> 27:01.924
and you can't outrun your past.

27:04.062 --> 27:05.853
You're saying goodbye.

27:22.539 --> 27:24.662
I'm saying I'm sorry...

27:25.375 --> 27:27.332
for everything.

27:28.336 --> 27:30.128
Everything.

27:30.839 --> 27:31.918
You're an idiot.

27:33.091 --> 27:35.582
I know it wasn't perfect,
but we were in it together.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.840
I was a wreck.

27:37.012 --> 27:39.717
The guy that saved the world
shows up at your door...

27:39.890 --> 27:42.641
you expect him
to have a couple of issues.

27:46.354 --> 27:48.845
And you're always so amazing
with Ben.

27:51.234 --> 27:54.437
You know what I wanted
more than anything...

27:58.408 --> 28:00.946
was a guy that Ben could look up to.

28:03.789 --> 28:05.413
Like-

28:06.750 --> 28:08.541
Like a dad.

28:10.337 --> 28:12.875
So you're saying it's all bad, Dean?

28:13.715 --> 28:16.384
Because it was the best year
of my life.

28:34.402 --> 28:37.403
What's the plan?
Oh, right now, we stock up, get set.

28:40.867 --> 28:43.239
So you're saying there is no plan.

28:43.787 --> 28:46.029
We'll find them. We gotta be patient.

28:46.790 --> 28:48.699
Yeah, okay.

28:48.875 --> 28:49.954
Or here's an alt.

28:50.127 --> 28:53.875
Why don't we go kill the sons of bitches
that broke into my home?

28:54.339 --> 28:57.790
Relax, Dean. We got it handled.
Djinn are hard to draw out.

28:59.010 --> 29:01.881
You've been out of the game.
Leave it to the professionals.

29:02.055 --> 29:03.597
Yeah. Sure.

29:06.101 --> 29:07.560
Tiny suggestion.

29:07.811 --> 29:11.394
You see, Djinn are easier to draw out
when you got bait.

29:11.940 --> 29:15.143
They want Sam and me.
They know where I live.

29:15.318 --> 29:19.067
Now, I haven't been hunting in a while,
but I'm gonna stick my neck out...

29:19.239 --> 29:21.991
and guess that's a pretty good place
for us to go.

29:24.453 --> 29:27.122
See, it's almost like
I'm a professional.

29:40.844 --> 29:42.124
Oh, I love this one.

29:42.304 --> 29:45.673
Yours or, uh, your wife's?

29:49.811 --> 29:51.471
Hey.

29:52.314 --> 29:54.390
Do me a favor. Don't touch that.

29:57.068 --> 29:58.693
Golf?

29:59.780 --> 30:02.734
- Really?
- It's a-It's a sport.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.495
Nice house.

30:19.049 --> 30:22.215
Oh, yeah. Go ahead, say it.
Call me a soccer mom. Whatever.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.386
"Soccer mom," huh?
I'll have to look that up on the intranet.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.178
Believe it or not, I-I get it, Dean.

30:30.352 --> 30:34.017
You wanted a normal life.
Your mom wanted a normal life too.

30:36.691 --> 30:39.229
You remind me of her, actually.

30:39.986 --> 30:42.193
The attitude, for one thing.

30:43.657 --> 30:46.777
Your brother tell you what we been
dealing with the past few months?

30:46.952 --> 30:48.114
No, not really.

30:48.286 --> 30:51.620
I've never seen anything like it.
Been working round the clock.

30:51.790 --> 30:53.948
- So, what's going on?
- We don't know.

30:54.126 --> 30:56.747
It goes way past a couple of Djinn
acting off.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.918
Nocturnals attacking in broad daylight.
Werewolves out on the half-moon.

31:01.091 --> 31:04.507
Creatures we've never seen before.
We don't even know what they are.

31:04.678 --> 31:08.972
I'm knee-deep in half-eaten human hearts
and exsanguinated 10-year-olds...

31:09.141 --> 31:11.133
and it's all making me...

31:12.602 --> 31:13.978
uneasy.

31:15.689 --> 31:18.014
- So, what's your theory?
- You tell me.

31:18.191 --> 31:20.314
All we know is it's all hands on deck.

31:20.485 --> 31:24.186
We're counting on each other right now.
That's how it is with Campbells.

31:25.574 --> 31:26.772
We need you, Dean.

31:26.950 --> 31:28.409
Look, I hear you, but-

31:28.577 --> 31:30.783
You don't know
what you're part of, Dean.

31:34.082 --> 31:37.285
You know, you had ancestors...

31:37.461 --> 31:40.296
<i>hacking the heads off vamps
on the Mayflower.</i>

31:44.092 --> 31:46.049
What I'm saying
is that we're your blood.

31:46.219 --> 31:49.505
We're out there dying, trying to get
in front of whatever this is.

31:50.182 --> 31:52.008
Maybe not the best time for golf.

32:00.734 --> 32:02.062
Hey.

32:10.368 --> 32:13.322
- You don't really say much, do you?
- Enough.

32:15.373 --> 32:17.033
Any sign of them?

32:24.257 --> 32:26.795
Three Djinn off in the trees.

32:39.105 --> 32:41.643
Those Djinn are just sitting out there,
watching us.

32:41.817 --> 32:43.774
Everybody's gotta clear out.
What?

32:43.944 --> 32:46.020
They're not gonna come
until me and Sam are alone.

32:46.196 --> 32:48.604
So I'm supposed to leave you here
with no backup?

32:48.782 --> 32:50.858
Dean's right. They're smart.

32:51.034 --> 32:53.157
They'd wait
till they weren't outnumbered.

32:55.997 --> 32:59.532
All right, we won't be far.
You call when they come, you hear?

32:59.709 --> 33:01.417
You bet.

33:02.087 --> 33:03.747
Pack up, we're out of here.

33:27.487 --> 33:29.231
You okay?

33:31.116 --> 33:32.195
Oh, yeah.

33:33.827 --> 33:36.365
Yeah. No. This is-

33:36.538 --> 33:38.162
This is crazy.

33:38.331 --> 33:40.241
I mean, you, Grandpa...

33:40.792 --> 33:42.286
whoever brought you back...

33:42.836 --> 33:44.793
- They don't wanna be found.
- I get that.

33:45.005 --> 33:47.756
But who are they
and what do they want? Why?

33:47.924 --> 33:50.213
That's a good question.

33:52.971 --> 33:55.011
Do you remember it?

33:58.268 --> 33:59.928
- What?
- The cage.

34:00.103 --> 34:01.681
Yeah.

34:02.147 --> 34:04.389
- You wanna-?
- No.

34:05.150 --> 34:08.186
- If anybody can relate-
- Dean, I don't wanna talk about it.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.940
I'm back. I get to breathe fresh air.
Have a beer. Hunt with my family.

34:13.116 --> 34:14.195
See you again.

34:14.367 --> 34:16.989
So why exactly would I wanna
think about hell?

34:18.746 --> 34:20.786
And you really think...

34:39.225 --> 34:42.310
- They're dead and you know it.
- This is happening because of me.

34:42.478 --> 34:43.641
Dean-

35:06.753 --> 35:07.832
Sid.

35:19.099 --> 35:24.224
You made it through that last trip,
so how about a big fat double dose?

35:27.566 --> 35:29.724
Bad news, it'll kill you.

35:30.235 --> 35:32.940
But good news, at least you'll go fast.

35:44.624 --> 35:46.783
That's for our father,
you son of a bitch.

36:32.005 --> 36:34.876
I just-I couldn't sleep at that house.

36:38.678 --> 36:40.801
It's okay. Don't worry, we'll call Dean.

36:40.972 --> 36:44.555
Aw, don't worry about them, Dean.
Worry about me.

36:55.153 --> 36:56.861
No!

37:10.252 --> 37:12.161
There, there, kiddo.

37:12.337 --> 37:14.460
You stay away from him.

37:18.551 --> 37:20.129
Lisa.

37:23.682 --> 37:25.473
- Drink it.
- Ben, no.

37:26.685 --> 37:28.594
- You'll feel better.
- No!

37:33.149 --> 37:34.430
It's all your fault.

37:36.736 --> 37:38.065
Lisa.

37:38.822 --> 37:42.820
This, something else,
we both know that's details.

37:42.993 --> 37:45.234
There's something coming
for this one...

37:45.412 --> 37:46.692
and you can't stop it.

37:47.455 --> 37:49.033
It's all your fault. Lisa.

37:49.207 --> 37:50.951
Drink it. You'll feel better.

37:51.126 --> 37:52.324
- Ben, don't.
- Your fault.

37:52.502 --> 37:53.747
Can't stop it.

37:55.463 --> 37:57.919
- No!
- Aah!

38:18.778 --> 38:20.688
I got her. Go get Dean.

38:29.915 --> 38:31.160
No.

38:32.542 --> 38:35.329
- Got her.
- Relax, hon. We're not gonna kill you.

38:35.503 --> 38:37.662
Get her in the van
before the boys get back.

38:37.839 --> 38:38.870
Come on.

38:59.150 --> 39:01.108
So Samuel and the cozes?

39:01.278 --> 39:04.896
Don't know. They left in a hurry.
I'm meeting them back at their place.

39:05.073 --> 39:06.947
You coming with me?

39:08.326 --> 39:11.161
No. No, I'm going back
for Lisa and Ben.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.915
- I thought you said-
- I did. I changed my mind.

39:16.668 --> 39:20.500
- Look, I practically shoved you at them.
- A funny way to put it, but all right.

39:20.672 --> 39:22.748
I'm saying,
I really wanted that for you.

39:22.924 --> 39:27.337
And when I told you to go,
I thought you could have it, you know?

39:27.512 --> 39:29.386
But now I'm not so sure.

39:30.140 --> 39:34.387
I mean, you'll be putting them in danger
if you go back.

39:34.561 --> 39:36.886
So it's better to leave them alone,
unprotected?

39:37.063 --> 39:39.850
And then they're not in danger?
I did this to them.

39:40.025 --> 39:44.153
I made them vulnerable the moment I
knocked on their door. I can't undo that.

39:44.321 --> 39:47.524
But what I can do
is go with the best option.

39:52.746 --> 39:54.323
I hear you.

39:56.541 --> 40:00.455
I guess I just wish you were coming,
that's all.

40:00.629 --> 40:01.708
Why?

40:03.840 --> 40:05.382
- Don't be stupid.
- No, I mean it.

40:05.550 --> 40:08.006
You know plenty of good hunters.
I'm rusty.

40:08.178 --> 40:12.010
I did something seriously stupid going
out there. I almost got us both killed.

40:12.182 --> 40:13.890
And that's exactly why I want you.

40:14.559 --> 40:16.267
What are you talking about?

40:16.436 --> 40:17.811
You just went.

40:18.355 --> 40:19.434
You didn't hesitate.

40:19.606 --> 40:21.598
Because you care
and that's who you are.

40:22.859 --> 40:24.567
Me...

40:25.236 --> 40:27.858
- I wouldn't even think to try.
- Yes, you would.

40:30.241 --> 40:31.404
No, Dean.

40:32.285 --> 40:33.614
I'm telling you.

40:33.787 --> 40:36.456
It's just better with you around.
That's all.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.085
Listen.

40:47.300 --> 40:49.340
She should be hunting. Take her.

40:55.225 --> 40:56.802
Thanks. Really.

40:58.561 --> 41:00.887
But I already got my car set up
how I like it.

41:02.899 --> 41:04.892
I should hit the road.

41:05.944 --> 41:07.818
I'll walk you out.

41:13.493 --> 41:15.651
You keep in touch, you hear?

41:16.121 --> 41:17.781
Of course.

41:22.460 --> 41:25.034
It was really good to see you again,
Dean.
