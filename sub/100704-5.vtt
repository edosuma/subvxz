WEBVTT

01:14.699 --> 01:18.369
Man, I must be the old guy.
I remember I used to be way in the back.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.455
We wanted to give you a nice,
comfortable chair.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.963
So you're feeling all right?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.466
I guess so,
since you're gonna play me 40 minutes.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.926
You better be ready.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.148
That little Laker boy's
gonna take everybody one-on-one.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.777
Who, Kobe? Yeah.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.823
He don't let the game come to him.
He just go out there and take it.

01:56.324 --> 01:59.244
I'm going to make this shit happen.
Gonna make this a one-on-one game.

01:59.869 --> 02:03.164
I figured after the first four attempts
didn't go in, he was gonna chill.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.542
After the first four attempts?

02:05.625 --> 02:08.628
If I was his teammate,
I wouldn't pass him the fucking ball!

02:09.212 --> 02:11.923
You want this ball again, brother,
you better rebound.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.847
-This is the east locker room.
-Hold up, hold up.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.099
-We got nothing to do with the west.
-Hold up, hold up.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.519
He got nothing
but his damn Laker colors on.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.604
Yeah, yeah, like he coaching.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.315
Now, I'm with the old motherf--

02:29.983 --> 02:31.985
-The old mugs.
-There ain't many of us here, dog.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.863
That's why I come to say
"What's up?" to my boy.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.582
Hey, you know I'd be coming at him, Larry.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.084
Just like I used to come at both of y'all.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.506
He just wants to get
to the offensive end and go one-on-one.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.550
I'm gonna make his ass work down here.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.261
He hauling ass.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.972
I ain't tryin' to be down there
on a poster, dog.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.308
And all that shit.
I ain't jumpin' with him.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.506
I'll see you down the road.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.719
See you in the Finals. Hopefully.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.138
-Y'all gonna be there.
-I know we will.

07:05.299 --> 07:08.094
Sweet. You laced those.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.641
What was the year?

07:15.643 --> 07:16.519
That's when I started.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.732
Hey, man, you look at these shoes,

07:21.816 --> 07:24.068
you put these shoes on
then put on some of them...

07:24.819 --> 07:27.405
Innovation has taken a long turn.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.966
Did you have a shoe company
that you wanted to go with?

15:39.063 --> 15:41.565
I had to go back to all the way to '84
to whip y'all ass.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.025
Don't start that shit.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.691
Are you smoking a cigar, Mike?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.609
Give me one.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.404
You can't smoke it.
It will stunt your growth.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.382
When are you putting on the USAB sneakers?

21:41.758 --> 21:43.802
It's a week from Sunday, isn't it?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.639
Yeah, but I got a lot of partying to do
from now until then.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.190
If Chuck Daly plays me
over ten minutes, I'm quitting.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.371
All right, we're just going to ask
a few things about the Olympics.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.124
No Isiah Thomas stuff.

24:29.467 --> 24:32.721
<i>What did you treasure the most about</i>
<i>that experience that summer?</i>

24:53.074 --> 24:57.162
You haven't committed a foul in almost
a year and a half, man. How can you talk?

26:20.620 --> 26:23.498
Right there. Right back at it, baby.
I'm coming after you.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.799
They don't play no defense. That's weak.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.468
We ain't in Chicago Stadium no more.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.773
All they did was move
the Bulls stadium right here.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.442
That's all they did. That's all they did.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.652
This is the '90s.

27:34.736 --> 27:38.448
I don't care if it's the '90s or not.
What's that supposed to mean?

27:38.531 --> 27:40.408
This is the '90s.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.205
How you like that ass kicking
we gave y'all?

33:51.320 --> 33:54.240
Scottie says he doesn't think
he could play in the NBA.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.585
Harvey Schiller. What a dick.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.714
The guy who said
if we don't wear our uniforms,

36:14.797 --> 36:18.467
we can't accept our gold medal
and all that stuff.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.596
Is that still a big issue?
They still talking about that?

36:21.679 --> 36:25.224
Nah. They said they are going to
try to hide the Reebok on it.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.852
But they can't hide it
like I'm gonna hide it.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.731
They in for a big fucking surprise.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.612
Does it matter where they are, man?

44:58.695 --> 45:00.239
Or you want 'em just in the building?

45:00.322 --> 45:02.533
They could be in the locker room
next to God.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.956
-Next to who?
-God.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.375
You just got one from him.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.108
What up, fighter?

48:21.481 --> 48:22.733
Let's go, guys.
