23:37.417 --> 23:40.838
- Well, I was so ashamed
at what I was doing

23:40.838 --> 23:42.381
that I quit my lucrative job

23:42.381 --> 23:46.844
and I moved by myself
to a remote village in Venezuela

23:46.844 --> 23:49.346
that had been devastated by mudslides.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.015
I spent six months
rebuilding people's homes.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.851
My hands are covered in blisters,

23:53.851 --> 23:55.811

that I think is still with me.

24:02.568 --> 24:04.403

24:05.404 --> 24:10.576
And then one day,
every single house that I built fell down.

24:11.493 --> 24:14.830
Because I had no idea how to build houses.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.418

something very important.
