<i>[ squawking ]
Previously on St. Elsewhere.</i>

00:05.609 --> 00:08.010
I've been wishing that Myra
wouldn't answer the phone.

00:08.077 --> 00:11.782
I've been wishing she wasn't
there. I've been wishing this
whole thing was just a dream.

00:11.848 --> 00:14.351
Why were you quacking around
mrs. Pechar's room?

00:16.586 --> 00:19.389
This time, I'm leaving.

00:19.456 --> 00:21.959
For once, you stay
and you deal with it.

00:22.025 --> 00:23.493
<i>Tonight on st. Elsewhere.</i>

00:23.560 --> 00:26.363
A patient of mine
was treated last night
by Dr. Bullfinch.

00:26.430 --> 00:28.966
So?
So nobody's ever heard
of Dr. Bullfinch.

00:29.032 --> 00:32.536
I'm Dr. Paxton.
Ah, you're
the Bradshaw fellow.

00:32.601 --> 00:35.072
Well, it seems silly
to call anyone as pretty
as you a "Fellow."

00:35.138 --> 00:37.908
And good morning to you,
mrs. Petschek.
Dr. Bullfinch.

00:37.975 --> 00:40.744
"Please excuse Victor Ehrlich
from surgery today.
He has a cold."

00:40.811 --> 00:42.813
What is this?
A note from your doctor.

00:42.879 --> 00:44.314
You're about to have a baby.

00:44.381 --> 00:45.816
- when?
- You're in labor.

00:45.882 --> 00:47.918
My wife and I
have split up.

00:47.985 --> 00:49.853
I'm sorry
to hear that.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.090
You better scrub this afternoon,
or I'll make sure
you're back down...

00:53.156 --> 00:55.092
<i>in the animal research lab

00:55.158 --> 00:57.494
I know how difficult
this is for you.

00:57.561 --> 01:00.697
- But I think you should
see your baby.
- I don't wanna see him.

<i>What are you doin' here?
[ Craig continues,

02:48.505 --> 02:51.475
covering for Cerone.
His best Friend
left his wife.

02:51.541 --> 02:55.846
<i>Lame excuse.
Not when you consider
he left cerone's wife.</i>

02:55.912 --> 02:57.914
I don't get it.

02:57.981 --> 03:00.851
Cerone's wife dumps him
to be with his best friend.

03:00.917 --> 03:03.620
Now the friend dumps her.
It's pretty weird.

03:03.687 --> 03:05.689
Cerone says
she's a basket case,

03:05.756 --> 03:08.625
and they both think
this Guy's schizophrenic.

03:08.692 --> 03:10.961
Well, don't ever date anyone
crazier than yourself.

03:11.028 --> 03:13.297
You can never win.
[ scoffs ]
tell me about it.

03:13.363 --> 03:15.766
Come on. Can't anyone
answer that?

03:17.601 --> 03:19.603
Dr. Ehrlich.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.805
Could you repeat
the question?

03:24.041 --> 03:27.444
Dr. Samuels, you seem to be
senior staff member
in Attendance.

03:27.511 --> 03:30.847
- Would you care to respond?
- Pericardial tamponade.

03:30.914 --> 03:33.350
It's relatively uncommon,
but potentially fatal.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.786
- Criteria.
- Seven days after Surgery,

03:35.852 --> 03:38.555
look for
prominent jugular veins,
increased central pressure,

03:38.622 --> 03:43.527
decreased cardiac index
or a double heart shadow
on the chest x-Ray.

03:43.593 --> 03:46.396
Thank you.
Who's on my service today?

03:46.463 --> 03:49.933
Cerone is scheduled,
but he's out of town.
Who's covering?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.437
Oh, no. I am.

03:53.503 --> 03:55.973
Well, for the patient's
sake, Dr. Ehrlich,

03:56.039 --> 03:58.809
I hope you're more attentive
than you are now.

03:58.875 --> 04:02.212
I'll see you this afternoon
in the O.R. Okay. That's it.

04:15.192 --> 04:18.060
[ laughs ]
Oh, man. Who did this?
Did what?

04:18.128 --> 04:21.665
Wrote a medication order
on one of my patient's charts
in Crayon.

04:21.732 --> 04:25.369
[ laughs ]
recognize the signature?

04:25.435 --> 04:27.437
Looks Like
Bull-Something to me.

04:27.504 --> 04:29.940
Mmm.
Bullfinch.

04:30.007 --> 04:32.376
Never heard of him.
Neither have I.

04:32.442 --> 04:36.647
Great. Any suggestions?
No. Do you have
any suggestions?

04:36.713 --> 04:39.249

Dr. Auschlander?
Yes?

05:01.405 --> 05:04.174
Hello. I just wanted
to introduce myself.
I'm Dr. Paxton.

05:04.241 --> 05:06.810
Ah. You're
the Bradshaw Fellow.
That's right.

05:06.877 --> 05:10.213
Well, it seems silly
to call anyone as pretty
as you a "Fellow."

05:10.280 --> 05:12.482
Please sit Down.
Thank you.

05:12.549 --> 05:15.519
A belated congratulations.
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to greet you myself,

05:15.585 --> 05:17.587
but I was out of town
visiting my Grandchildren.

05:17.654 --> 05:20.023
Don't even
think twice about it.

05:20.090 --> 05:22.092
Now, let's see,
as I recall,

05:22.159 --> 05:24.461
you did your residency
at the Cleveland Clinic.

05:24.528 --> 05:28.298
That's right.
Fine hospital. I understand
the city's coming back too.

05:28.365 --> 05:31.101
Well, their phrase is,
"New York may be
the big apple,

05:31.168 --> 05:33.170
but Cleveland's a plum."

05:35.872 --> 05:40.577
I'm really thrilled about
having this chance to work
with you, Dr. Auschlander.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.713
I hope you won't
be disappointed.

05:42.779 --> 05:45.449
You have
a remarkable reputation.

05:45.515 --> 05:48.218
Flattery will get you
everywhere, doctor.

05:48.285 --> 05:52.623
But I think the Word's out.
Better work with him now--
He won't be around much longer.

05:52.689 --> 05:56.460
My health has become grist
for the medical gossip mill.

05:56.526 --> 05:58.528
You do know
I have cancer?

05:58.595 --> 06:04.167
Yes. Dr. Wyler told me
right before I left africa.
I'm sorry.

06:04.234 --> 06:06.903
Don't be. There's not
time enough to be sorry.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.972
Is he still working
20 hours a day?

06:09.039 --> 06:11.575
Every day.
You cannot slow him down.

06:11.642 --> 06:13.877
You know, there were doctors
with More experience...

06:13.944 --> 06:16.246
in the field of endocrinology
than you.

06:16.313 --> 06:18.315
But you had the widest
range of experience,

06:18.382 --> 06:20.384
and wyler said you worked
even Harder than he did.

06:20.450 --> 06:22.919
Well, the peace corps
can do that to you.

06:22.986 --> 06:25.055
<i>[ knocking ]

I'm showing a Chaplin film
this morning for some of
my terminal Patients.

Laughter seems to be

06:35.165 --> 06:39.236
It's too early to quantify that,
but that's where you'll
eventually come in.

06:39.303 --> 06:41.505
I look forward to it.

Wonderful to meet you.
Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye.

06:48.845 --> 06:51.448
I don't know. Maybe
my biorhythms are off.

06:51.515 --> 06:53.517
Whatever it is,
Craig's not gonna buy it.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.920
There's one thing that
might get you out of surgery
this afternoon. Turn around.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.956
What are you doing?
You'll see.

07:08.432 --> 07:10.434
Here you go.

"Please excuse Victor Ehrlich
from surgery today.
He has a cold."

07:13.437 --> 07:15.439
What is this?
A note from your doctor.

07:15.505 --> 07:18.342
I used to write 'em
in high school. Got me
out of two years of phys ed.

07:18.408 --> 07:20.344
I believe it.
I've seen your body.

07:20.410 --> 07:22.813
I don't know. Maybe I'll
just crash in on call.

07:22.879 --> 07:25.716
Don't bother.
There's two "Gomers"
Sleeping in there.

Uh, Jack--
No, I can't cover for you.
I'm already on call.

07:34.224 --> 07:38.595
Wait, listen. A patient of mine
was treated last night
by Dr. Bullfinch.

07:38.662 --> 07:41.832
So?
So nobody's ever heard
of Dr. Bullfinch.

07:41.898 --> 07:43.967
You sure you got
the right name?

07:44.034 --> 07:47.371
Of course I'm sure.
It's written right here
in green and orange.

07:48.672 --> 07:52.309
Check with Dr. Westphall.
I gotta start rounds.

07:55.412 --> 07:59.182
<i>[ Fiscus ] you know,

He's brought in
an incredible
piece of anatomy--

08:01.885 --> 08:05.355
Five foot 5, blonde,
a balcony you could
do shakespeare from.

08:05.422 --> 08:08.392
I see. And this makes him
a great humanitarian, right?

08:08.458 --> 08:10.794
Sure. A Lesser man would
keep her for himself.

08:10.861 --> 08:12.863
I asked her
to come down here
to check on a lady...

08:12.929 --> 08:15.532
who's got what I think's
a bad liver.

08:15.599 --> 08:18.635
If you behave yourself,
I'll introduce you to her.
No, thanks.

08:18.702 --> 08:20.704
Come on. I owe you.

08:20.771 --> 08:24.708
Well, okay. I mean,
one more woman in my life
can't hurt, right?

08:24.775 --> 08:26.743
There she is.
Hey, Nancy. Wait.

08:28.679 --> 08:31.949
<i>Oh, my God.

this is Ben Samuels.
Ben.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.389
This is Nancy Paxton.
Nancy!

08:39.456 --> 08:41.457
All I got
was a handshake.
What are you doing here?

08:41.525 --> 08:43.527
It's so good
to see you.
I don't believe this.

08:43.592 --> 08:46.596
The last time I saw you,
you were, what, a junior
or senior at nyu.

08:46.663 --> 08:49.166
You were just beginning
medical school.
I don't believe this.

08:49.232 --> 08:53.737
Nancy's sister, Janet, and I
went to school together.
Oh, great.

08:53.804 --> 08:57.007
How is she?
She's dropped out
of medicine.

08:57.074 --> 08:59.910
She lives on a ranch in colorado
with her husband and two kids.
Really?

08:59.977 --> 09:02.879
Yeah.
So you became the doctor
in the family.

09:02.946 --> 09:05.382
Right.
I don't wanna break up
this reunion,

09:05.449 --> 09:08.685
but we have a lady
with a distended liver.

09:08.752 --> 09:10.988
Excuse us.
Oh. Uh--

09:11.054 --> 09:13.657
We should talk.
Yeah, definitely.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.692
Okay.
I'm around.

09:18.729 --> 09:20.731
<i>Donald, one of these days,
I'm gonna come to work,</i>

09:20.797 --> 09:22.799
and this hospital
isn't gonna be here.

09:22.866 --> 09:26.403
Someone's gonna have
dismantled this old place
and sold it off brick by Brick.

09:26.470 --> 09:29.306
With the current budget deficit,
it'll probably be our creditors.

09:29.373 --> 09:32.809
I can't believe the paperwork
I'm gonna have to do
to get those beds back.

09:35.379 --> 09:37.814
And good morning to you,
mrs. Petschek.

09:37.881 --> 09:41.018
Dr. Bullfinch.
I'm so glad to see you.

09:41.084 --> 09:44.821
And how did we sleep
last night?
Like a log.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.190
Any more pain
in your abdomen?
None to speak of.

09:47.257 --> 09:49.259
I'm feeling
so much better.

09:49.326 --> 09:52.129
Ah. That's the kind of news
we doctors like to hear.

09:52.195 --> 09:54.631
You're gonna be out
of this place in no time.

09:54.698 --> 09:58.402
Thanks to you, doctor.
And please, call me Evelyn.

09:58.468 --> 10:03.874
Evelyn, I'm going to make
a slight adjustment
in your medication order.

10:03.941 --> 10:07.778
30 C.C.'s of mylanta,
two "Q" Hours
instead of "Q" Four,

10:07.844 --> 10:12.149
and we'll add to that
300 milligrams of cimetidine...

10:12.215 --> 10:14.751
"Q" Eight hours.

10:14.818 --> 10:16.820
Should I mention this
to Dr. Chandler?

10:16.887 --> 10:20.057
No, don't bother.
I'll tell him myself.

10:20.123 --> 10:23.627
Two doctors.
How lucky can you get?

10:23.694 --> 10:26.930
Evelyn, can I ask you
a personal question?

10:26.997 --> 10:29.633
Of course.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.569
Can you samba?
Why, yes.

10:32.636 --> 10:35.772
Leonard and I took lessons
on our caribbean Cruise.

10:35.839 --> 10:37.774
Oh, excellent.

10:37.841 --> 10:41.011
<i>Until we meet again,
mon Petit Chou-Fleur.</i>

10:41.078 --> 10:43.113
Oh, Dr. Bullfinch.

10:48.352 --> 10:51.154
Oh, what's blue cross?

10:51.221 --> 10:55.125
I guess it's safe
to assume you don't
have medical insurance.

10:55.192 --> 10:57.227
What's medical insurance?

10:59.463 --> 11:01.465
[ Paxton ]
how often do you drink?

11:01.531 --> 11:04.301
I only drink beer.
I never touch
the hard stuff.

11:04.368 --> 11:07.004
How much do you
drink a day?
Just a couple.

11:07.070 --> 11:10.274
The other doctor
thought it might
be my liver.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.410
My whole stomach
is cramping on me,
and my back hurts.

11:13.477 --> 11:16.179
Have you ever had
your appendix out?
Yes.

11:16.246 --> 11:18.915
How about
any constipation?
No.

11:18.982 --> 11:22.185
Nausea at all?
Do you have diarrhea?
No.

11:22.252 --> 11:24.354
<i>[ siren approaching ]
we'll get to you
as soon as possible.</i>

11:24.421 --> 11:27.724
How come those machines
never work? Or are they
supposed to be sculptures?

11:27.791 --> 11:30.060
Don't hassle the lady,
Twerp.

11:30.127 --> 11:33.196
<i>That's Dr. Twerp
to you.</i>

11:33.263 --> 11:35.165
Bring him in here.

11:37.801 --> 11:39.736
<i>Where's x-ray?</i>

11:39.803 --> 11:43.073
We need to find out
if there's any damage
to the axillary artery...

11:43.140 --> 11:45.309
and the brachial plexus.

11:45.375 --> 11:49.246
Okay, on three.
One, two, three.

11:49.313 --> 11:51.315
[ Groans ]

11:51.381 --> 11:55.352
can you make a fist, sir?
Good.

11:55.419 --> 11:58.355
Lucky nobody took this out.
It saved a lot of blood loss.

11:58.422 --> 12:01.925
We'll wail till things
stabilize, check the x-Rays,
and then I'll clean you up.

12:01.992 --> 12:04.461
This happen
on the golf course, sir?
[ muffled ] Yes.

12:04.528 --> 12:06.463
If I were you,
I'd find a friendlier foursome.

12:06.530 --> 12:09.199
We're gonna have to cut
your clothes off, okay, sir?
Okay.

12:09.266 --> 12:13.103
[ moaning ]
just take it easy.
Careful now.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.872
If my back goes out,
I can collect disability, right?

12:20.344 --> 12:22.980
Listen to this one.
According to his
playing partner,

12:23.046 --> 12:27.084
Mr. Grossman here
missed a three-Foot putt,
got angry and threw his club.

12:27.150 --> 12:30.187
Unfortunately,
it hit his golf cart,
snapped in two,

12:30.253 --> 12:32.589
and he gets impaled
on the rebound.

12:32.656 --> 12:34.591
I make the putt,

12:34.658 --> 12:37.227
I break 90
for the first Time.

12:37.294 --> 12:40.764
- If it were up to me,
I'd have given it to you.
- Thank you.

12:41.865 --> 12:43.867
You're pregnant.
What?

12:43.934 --> 12:47.804
You're pregnant,
miss Barnett.
That's impossible.

12:47.871 --> 12:50.574
Daniels, tell me
what you hear.

12:53.110 --> 12:55.812
A healthy
little heartbeat.
Congratulations.

12:55.879 --> 13:00.484
But why does it hurt so bad?
I mean, the pain's killing me.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.552
You're in labor.

13:02.619 --> 13:04.988
- You're about to have a baby.
- when?

13:05.055 --> 13:07.824
As far as I can tell,
any time now.

13:07.891 --> 13:10.260
[ Moans ]

13:10.327 --> 13:12.562
[ cries ]

13:18.602 --> 13:20.604
how you doin'?

13:20.671 --> 13:23.106
I've had better saturdays.

13:23.173 --> 13:26.276
Mr. Grossman,
if this had been excalibur
and I were Arthur,

13:26.343 --> 13:28.278
I'd be king of England.

13:28.345 --> 13:30.514
Then again, maybe this
makes me Jack nicklaus.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.683
Here.
Have a souvenir.
Thanks.

13:32.749 --> 13:35.485
It only went through the belly
of the pectoralis major muscle.

13:35.552 --> 13:39.356
There's no artery
or nerve damage.
You're a lucky man.

13:39.423 --> 13:42.259
If I was a lucky man,
I would've made the putt.

13:42.326 --> 13:44.294
[ chuckles ]
see you around.

13:46.496 --> 13:49.066
Well, what is it--
Boy or girl?

13:49.132 --> 13:51.468
Circumcision.
Oh.

13:54.271 --> 13:56.340
Mrs. Petschek,
I'm Dr. Westphall.

13:56.406 --> 13:58.442
I remember you.
You do?

13:58.508 --> 14:02.679
Sure. You took care of
my husband Leonard's kidney
condition three years ago.

14:02.746 --> 14:04.681
Ah.
Saved his life.

14:04.748 --> 14:07.217
Is there something wrong
with my kidneys?

14:07.284 --> 14:09.353
No. Just wanted to see
how you're feeling.

14:09.419 --> 14:11.388
Much better, thank you.

14:11.455 --> 14:13.824
The pain in My stomach is gone.
[ knocks on Table ]
thank God.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.493
Miss Petschek
had a bleeding ulcer.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.762
<i>Stress. Leonard says
I worry too much.</i>

14:18.829 --> 14:21.965
<i>Dr. Bullfinch
Agreed.
Dr. Bullfinch?</i>

14:22.032 --> 14:25.002
He was here last night
and again this morning.

14:25.068 --> 14:27.404
A nice, good-Looking man--
Like you two.

14:27.471 --> 14:29.339
<i>You know him.
Oh, sure.</i>

14:29.406 --> 14:31.842
He was so kind
and so concerned.

14:31.908 --> 14:34.311
We talked
for the longest time.

14:34.378 --> 14:36.380
Then he prescribed
some kind of medicine,

14:36.446 --> 14:39.616
told me to take
two teaspoons before meals.

14:39.683 --> 14:42.386
It would cure
my ruffled feathers,
he said.

14:42.452 --> 14:45.522
Can I see the new medicine?
It worked.
I slept like a baby.

14:45.589 --> 14:47.557
Here it is.

14:49.326 --> 14:54.064
Oh, this has a crack
in this bottle, Mrs. Petschek.
I'll replace it for you.

14:54.131 --> 14:56.133
Before bedtime?
Before Bedtime.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.135
Give my regards
to your husband.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.570
Leonard died last spring.
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:00.637 --> 15:04.374
He was walking over
to Brigham's with my
beautiful collie, laddie,

15:04.441 --> 15:07.444
to pick me up
a pint of mocha chip.

15:07.511 --> 15:09.513
Leonard liked vanilla
himself.

15:09.579 --> 15:13.250
<i>A simple man deserves
 a simple ice cream.</i>

15:13.317 --> 15:17.020
Coming back, they got killed
by a hit-and-Run car.

15:17.087 --> 15:20.290
"Hit and run."
That's what the police told me.

15:20.357 --> 15:22.359
You never know.

15:22.426 --> 15:25.963
Now, at least my laddie
is always with me.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.068
He's stuffed?

15:31.134 --> 15:32.869
[ Knocks ]

15:32.936 --> 15:37.140
uh, did you have your husband
stuffed too, miss petschek?

15:37.207 --> 15:40.177
Oh, no.
I had Leonard Cremated.

15:40.243 --> 15:43.213
His ashes are on the mantel
in the living room.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.515
What do you think I am,
sick?

15:53.557 --> 15:56.360
Chandler, have the lab
break this down, stat.

15:56.426 --> 15:58.929
Hope we don't have
to pump her stomach.
Yes, sir.

15:58.996 --> 16:01.565
Keep an eye on her.
Why isn't she on psych?

16:01.632 --> 16:04.835
We tried to get her up there,
but they said they didn't
have any room.

16:04.901 --> 16:08.071
Get someone down here
from psych liaison,
have a look at her.

16:08.138 --> 16:11.575
Keep your eyes open
for our Dr. Bullfinch.
Yeah.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.383
Hello, Gina.

16:19.449 --> 16:22.219
How are you feeling?
Tired.

16:22.286 --> 16:24.588
Your baby
is Doing just fine.

16:24.655 --> 16:28.625
Because he was a bit premature,
a pediatrician is performing
a few routine tests.

16:28.692 --> 16:31.028
But don't worry about it.
It's strictly
precautionary.

16:31.094 --> 16:33.096
I'll be able
to bring him
to you soon.

16:33.163 --> 16:35.332
I don't want to see him.

16:37.234 --> 16:39.369
I don't understand.

16:39.436 --> 16:43.440
I can't be a mother.
I just can't do it.

16:43.507 --> 16:46.543
Have you called
your husband?

16:46.610 --> 16:49.546
I'm not married.

16:49.613 --> 16:52.382
I tried calling Richie
to tell him.

16:52.449 --> 16:55.218
But after he lost his job,
he said he was moving
to Houston.

16:55.285 --> 16:58.488
Richie thinks there's a lot
of opportunities in Houston.

16:58.555 --> 17:01.224
Information says
he's not in the book.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.260
I can't keep this baby.

17:04.493 --> 17:06.430
Have you reached
your family?

17:06.496 --> 17:08.498
My father doesn't
answer the Phone.

17:08.565 --> 17:10.634
He had a stroke.
He's alone?

17:10.701 --> 17:14.671
No. Well, I take care of him
before and after work.

17:14.738 --> 17:16.673
What do you do?

17:16.740 --> 17:21.178
I make doughnuts...
at-- At Danny's doughnut shop.

17:21.243 --> 17:24.114
I sit and I talk to my father
Until he falls asleep,

17:24.181 --> 17:27.684
and then I go in
and I open the shop
about 3:00 in the Morning.

17:27.751 --> 17:31.521
Mr. A.-- he's my boss--
says it's hard to get people
to work that early.

17:31.588 --> 17:33.523
But I like it.

17:33.590 --> 17:36.927
There's this big glass window
in the kitchen.

17:36.994 --> 17:40.464
I like watchin' the sun come up
and people goin' to work.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.566
Sometimes they stop
and they watch me.

17:42.633 --> 17:46.069
I wave at them,
and they wave back.

And tell him I won't
be in to work tomorrow.

He's gonna be real mad.
I'll call him for you.
I'm sure he'll understand.

because of this.

is just such a mess.

this is for you,

called home since you left.

to punish yourself, don't you?
Hey. Save the lectures, Jack.

19:35.612 --> 19:38.181
<i>How could you be
eight months' pregnant
and not know it?</i>

19:38.248 --> 19:41.418
You'd think that once
she stopped menstruating,
she'd know something was up.

19:41.485 --> 19:44.488
If my period's more
than a couple days late,
I start checking my calendar.

19:44.554 --> 19:47.691
Well, never underestimate
how uninformed people are.

19:47.758 --> 19:51.495
I once gave this lecture
to a group of teenagers
in Cleveland.

19:51.561 --> 19:54.998
And I said that the best
method of birth control
was abstinence.

19:55.065 --> 19:57.901
So this girl raises her hand
and asks if it comes
in liquid form,

19:57.968 --> 20:01.405
'cause she has trouble
swallowing Pills.

20:01.471 --> 20:04.308
I guess birth control isn't
at the top of Everyone's
priority list.

20:04.374 --> 20:07.911
Well.
I guess you ran into a lot
of that in the peace corps.

20:07.978 --> 20:12.816
The Third world is not exactly
a walking endorsement
for zero population growth.

20:12.883 --> 20:14.818
It can be really
depressing.

20:14.885 --> 20:17.120
Still, it must have
been pretty exciting
being in Africa.

20:17.187 --> 20:19.222
Mm-Hmm.

20:19.289 --> 20:23.393
A village chieftain once
offered me three water buffalo
and a yak to become his wife.

20:23.460 --> 20:27.364
What happened?
I held out for another yak.
He decided I wasn't worth it.

for stamina, then doctors
can do it for surgery.

21:42.105 --> 21:44.741
Then what do you want?
I want to wish you
good luck today.

21:44.808 --> 21:47.945
I heard Dr. Craig's

Believe me,
you're in good hands.
He's the best.

21:50.914 --> 21:54.117
- What did he pay you
to say that?
- Seven dollars.

21:55.485 --> 21:58.155
You don't sound
very confident
in his ability.

21:58.221 --> 22:00.524
Confident? Listen,
just between you and me,

22:00.590 --> 22:02.859
I don't think I'm gonna
make it off that table.

<i>How come?
Well, I've always
been unlucky.</i>

22:06.129 --> 22:08.465
<i>Why should it be
different now?</i>

22:08.532 --> 22:10.534
Do you have a family,
Mr. Ullman?

22:10.600 --> 22:12.836
No, not anymore.

a Diehard red sox Fan.

22:16.807 --> 22:18.942
That's not
an easy thing to be.

So when my wife started
rooting for the yankees...

22:21.345 --> 22:24.982
during Dimaggio's
hitting streak,
I dumped her.

22:25.048 --> 22:28.785
<i>And in 1958, my son
followed the dodgers
out to california.</i>

22:28.852 --> 22:30.854
<i>I haven't talked
to him since.</i>

22:30.921 --> 22:34.858
- I see.
- You, uh--
You got a team?

22:34.925 --> 22:38.562
The orioles, cardinals
and the blue jays.

22:41.298 --> 22:44.568
Hey, I'm for the underdog,
just like you.

22:46.570 --> 22:48.505
Remember that certain
feeling in the air...

22:48.572 --> 22:51.074
<i>on opening day
at fenway?</i>

22:51.141 --> 22:53.143
It starts as a whisper
in the bleachers...

22:53.210 --> 22:56.613
and ends up reverberating
all over the park.

22:57.748 --> 23:00.317
"This could be the year."

23:00.384 --> 23:03.420
"This could be the year."

23:03.487 --> 23:07.424
Everyone senses it,
and everyone believes it.

23:07.491 --> 23:11.061
This could be the year
for you too, Mr. Ullman.

23:11.128 --> 23:16.033
Fill your lungs with it.
There's so much to live for.

23:16.099 --> 23:18.101
Yeah? Like what?

23:18.168 --> 23:20.937
Imagine this.

23:21.004 --> 23:25.042
It's late in the afternoon
on one of those Crisp
autumn weekends.

23:25.108 --> 23:27.110
The air is filled
with the aroma...

23:27.177 --> 23:29.513
of burning leaves
and pumpkin pie.

23:29.579 --> 23:32.249
The red sox
are in the world series.

23:32.316 --> 23:35.385
You look up at the sky
and catch the sight...

23:35.452 --> 23:39.489
of a migrating flock
soaring in perfect formation.

23:41.758 --> 23:46.330
It gets smaller and smaller
and finally disappears
into the setting Sun.

23:47.998 --> 23:50.000
Can you see it, Mr. Ullman?

23:50.067 --> 23:53.103

Come on in.
We're having a party.

38:08.191 --> 38:10.694
You know Dr. Bullfinch,
don't you?

38:10.761 --> 38:12.796
Oh, hello, nurse.
Care to dance?

38:12.863 --> 38:16.133
Uh, no.
My card is Full.

38:16.199 --> 38:19.436
Suit yourself.
â™ªâ™ª [ humming, vocalizing ]

38:19.503 --> 38:21.805
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.
[ sighs ]

38:21.872 --> 38:26.143
[ together ]
â™ª when we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek â™ªâ™ª

38:26.209 --> 38:29.079
<i>[ woman on P.A. ]
maintenance to E.R.</i>

38:29.146 --> 38:31.448
<i>Maintenance to E.R.</i>

38:33.116 --> 38:35.585
Nurse, a patient
in maternity--
Gina Barnett--

38:35.652 --> 38:38.055
is not in her bed,
and her clothes are gone.

38:38.121 --> 38:41.358
Real fat lady?
She walked out of here
half an hour ago.

38:41.425 --> 38:43.527
She just left?
I don't know.

38:45.996 --> 38:49.900
So it is True?
It's all under control, Mark.
He's been found.

38:49.967 --> 38:52.970
That fruitcake has been
wandering around here
treating the patients.

38:53.036 --> 38:54.972
Boy, that's rich.

38:55.038 --> 38:57.808
Before you know it,
some loony will
be after your job.

38:57.874 --> 39:00.110
There he is.

39:00.177 --> 39:02.179
Dr. Bullfinch,
I presume?

39:02.245 --> 39:04.748
Dr. Westphall.
Dr. Craig.

39:04.815 --> 39:07.484
What did you
put in the bottle
you gave mrs. Petschek?

39:07.551 --> 39:09.886
A dietary supplement
of vitamins and minerals--

39:09.953 --> 39:12.789
to give a shine to her coat
and a spring to her walk.

39:12.856 --> 39:15.726
The prognosis is excellent,
Doctor.

39:15.792 --> 39:19.062
Dr. Beale, I'd like
to talk to you.

39:19.129 --> 39:22.265
Would you keep an eye
on Ralph, mark?

39:22.332 --> 39:25.068
You stand over here.
Right there.

39:27.638 --> 39:29.573
How'd he get loose
this time?
I don't know.

39:29.640 --> 39:33.277
I want this guy under lock and
key. If you can't handle him,
we'll transfer him to roxbury.

39:33.343 --> 39:38.181
I think that'd be a mistake.
I will not have this man running
around here playing Doctor.

39:41.418 --> 39:44.154
Dr. Craig.
Dr. Bullfinch.

39:44.221 --> 39:47.758
Nice work today,
Doctor.
Well, thank you, sir.

39:47.824 --> 39:51.595
I assisted him today.
What the hell's going on
around here?

39:51.662 --> 39:54.097
Come on, Ralph.
Come on. Let's go.

39:54.164 --> 39:56.400
<i>Hasta la vista,
Dr. Craig.</i>

39:58.068 --> 40:00.504
Hey, Pearle!
I wanna talk to you.

40:12.749 --> 40:14.651
[ sighs ]

40:23.360 --> 40:25.362
I thought that was you,
Dr. Paxton.

40:25.429 --> 40:28.031
The slumped shoulders
are a dead giveaway.

40:30.233 --> 40:33.303
I've been asked to address
the HARVARD medical school
tomorrow morning...

40:33.370 --> 40:35.672
on hepatic endocrinopathies.

40:35.739 --> 40:39.376
Now, the problem is,
the students have gotten
too smart for me.

40:40.477 --> 40:43.146
Their questions
are too imposing.

40:47.184 --> 40:49.653
Would you care to help me
fend them off?

40:49.720 --> 40:51.822
[ Both laughing ]

40:51.888 --> 40:54.825
I would be honored to.
So, how goes it?

40:54.891 --> 40:56.860
[ sighs ]

40:56.927 --> 40:59.329
a patient of mine
gave birth this morning...

40:59.396 --> 41:02.199
and walked out of here
about an hour ago--
Abandoned the Baby.

41:02.265 --> 41:04.234
That's very sad.

41:05.802 --> 41:09.473
I've spent the last two years
living in an environment...

41:09.539 --> 41:11.475
that nurtures death,

41:11.541 --> 41:14.278
that is so spiteful of life.

41:14.344 --> 41:16.346
Babies dying
in their mothers' arms,

41:16.413 --> 41:19.049
their stomachs swollen
with Starvation.

41:19.116 --> 41:22.019
And always it's the children
who are the innocent victims.

41:22.085 --> 41:24.521
Perhaps the mother
will return.

41:24.588 --> 41:27.257
I keep trying
to convince myself of that.

41:27.324 --> 41:30.927
How can you let your child go
when you don't have to,

41:30.994 --> 41:35.666
when its fate isn't already
decided by-- by DROUGHT
or DISEASE or war?

41:37.200 --> 41:39.803
In any case, the child
will be well taken care of.

41:39.870 --> 41:42.839
I know that.
I'll see to it.

41:42.906 --> 41:45.442
The Lecture's at 10:00.

41:45.509 --> 41:48.946
Shall we meet about 9:00
for a cup of coffee?

41:50.847 --> 41:52.816
Good night, Nancy.
Good night.

41:56.687 --> 42:00.090
<i>The doctors all complain
about being overworked,
and, since I've read...</i>

42:00.157 --> 42:02.659
<i>all the back issues
of the new England
journal of medicine,</i>

42:02.726 --> 42:04.461
I figured I could help.

42:04.528 --> 42:07.297
It's against the law
to impersonate a doctor.
Have a seat.

42:07.364 --> 42:09.433
It's not against
the law of nature, Hugh.

42:09.499 --> 42:13.337
I'm helping to protect
an endangered species.
Oh, and what's that?

42:13.403 --> 42:15.472
The creatures of the earth
who've been abandoned.

42:15.539 --> 42:20.043
Once left alone,
they cannot survive.
Like mrs. Petschek.

42:20.110 --> 42:23.313
She needs someone to talk with,
someone to share her pain.

42:23.380 --> 42:26.016
I gave her vitamins.
We danced and laughed.

42:26.083 --> 42:29.386
It felt good.
You sound
real positive, Ralph.

42:30.721 --> 42:32.623
Hugh.

42:34.458 --> 42:38.261
<i>Between you and me,
the eagle has landed.</i>

42:38.328 --> 42:43.367
I've stopped eating garbage.
There's no future in it.
Good. Good for you, Ralph.

42:43.433 --> 42:47.371
I got a letter
from Jane yesterday.
Oh? How is she?

42:47.437 --> 42:49.506
Great. Listen to this.

42:53.043 --> 42:57.147
"You are my eagle.
You are the noblest
of birds.

42:57.214 --> 42:59.216
"Soon I will be
by your side,

42:59.283 --> 43:03.620
"and we will soar to a place
where time stands still
Forever.

43:03.687 --> 43:06.556
Wait for me.
I love you."

43:06.623 --> 43:10.661
It's signed,
"Your tweety bird, Jane."

43:10.727 --> 43:14.564
It's a beautiful letter,
isn't it?
Yes. Yes, it is.

43:14.631 --> 43:16.600
Can I see it?

43:25.142 --> 43:27.210
Like these goldfish.

43:28.412 --> 43:30.314
Hi, fishies.

43:31.848 --> 43:35.552
Putting them in a bowl
isn't trapping them.
It's saving them.

43:35.619 --> 43:39.423
There's, uh--
there's no postmark
on this letter, Ralph.

43:39.489 --> 43:42.192
If one left,
the other would die.

43:42.259 --> 43:45.796
But they won't, because
you nurture them both.
You keep them alive.

43:45.862 --> 43:48.365
You wrote this letter
to yourself, didn't you, Ralph?

43:50.233 --> 43:52.836
Put me back in my cage, Hugh.
I want to be safe too.

43:52.903 --> 43:54.905
It's too dangerous
out there.

43:54.972 --> 43:58.342
<i>You'll take care of me
till Jane comes back,
won't you?</i>

43:58.408 --> 44:00.310
Yes.

44:11.321 --> 44:15.459
The reason why your mother
taught you to lock
the bathroom door, Dr. Paxton,

44:15.525 --> 44:17.661
is to protect you
from guys like me.

44:20.063 --> 44:24.468
Great legs, Nancy.
Always had great Legs.

44:24.534 --> 44:26.470
Hello, Ben.

44:26.536 --> 44:29.606
So, how's it goin'?
tough day?

44:29.673 --> 44:33.110
Well, for an opener,
it was pretty Grim.

44:33.176 --> 44:35.245
Welcome to st. Eligius.

44:35.312 --> 44:39.116
You, uh, mind
if I join you?
Upstairs.

44:39.182 --> 44:41.685
You know it makes me crazy
when you tell me
to get on top.

44:41.752 --> 44:44.221
[ laughs ]

44:44.288 --> 44:46.423
Oh. Room with a view, huh?

44:46.490 --> 44:50.193
Well, your sense of humor
has not improved with
the passage of years.

44:50.260 --> 44:52.996
[ laughs, sighs ]

44:53.063 --> 44:55.032
[ sighs ]

44:57.267 --> 44:59.202
so, how's it going?

44:59.269 --> 45:01.238
[ Laughing ]

45:01.305 --> 45:04.374
Well, there's a great
icebreaker. "How's it goin'?"

45:04.441 --> 45:09.046
Well, do you remember when you
used to try to make a neat
little package of your life--

45:09.112 --> 45:11.615
Put everything
on a timetable?

45:11.682 --> 45:14.584
At 35, I figured I'll be living
in the south of France--

45:14.651 --> 45:17.888
Retired, with the wife
and the little ruggers.

45:17.955 --> 45:22.526
Instead, I'm spending my life
working in a hospital
in the south of Boston.

45:22.592 --> 45:25.028
<i>"How's it goin'?"</i>

45:25.095 --> 45:28.665
<i>I'm surviving.
Dreams die hard.</i>

45:28.732 --> 45:30.734
What the hell
am I doing up here?

45:30.801 --> 45:33.070
I feel like
I'm in a Doris day movie.

45:38.675 --> 45:41.244
You know,

45:41.311 --> 45:44.715
I used to fall in love
in four-year cycles.

45:44.781 --> 45:48.518
Fifteen, 19, 23...

45:48.585 --> 45:50.554
and then finally at 27.

45:52.255 --> 45:55.392
Then it stopped.
Thirty-One, 35-- Washouts.

45:57.294 --> 46:01.798
And now you come back
into my life, and it's--
It's like you never left.

46:05.369 --> 46:07.371
You remember the christmas
we spent together?

46:07.437 --> 46:12.042
You, me, that jerk
Carl froman and--
What was his girlfriend's name?

46:12.109 --> 46:14.745
Allison.
Allison.
[ chuckling ]

46:14.811 --> 46:17.314
you never liked Carl, and
I could not figure it out.

46:17.381 --> 46:20.484
After all,
he did introduce us.
Reason enough, right?

46:20.550 --> 46:23.086
Oh, very funny.

46:23.153 --> 46:25.956
Oh, I still hear
from Carl.
Why?

46:26.023 --> 46:28.358
I married him.

46:29.726 --> 46:33.330
You're kidding?
Oh, I wish I were.

46:33.397 --> 46:35.399
I wish.
I married him,

46:35.465 --> 46:37.801
I sent him through law school,
and I divorced him.

46:37.868 --> 46:42.339
[ both laughing ]
Well, you saved
the court costs at least.

46:42.406 --> 46:45.042
<i>Oh. Carl was a jerk.</i>

46:45.108 --> 46:48.178
Ten years-- We're finally
starting to agree.

46:48.245 --> 46:50.480
We got along All right.

46:50.547 --> 46:55.185
We argued like crazy.
Well, the sex was good.

46:55.252 --> 46:57.955
The Sex was great.

46:59.456 --> 47:03.794
Do you know
what I remember?
What?

47:03.860 --> 47:06.997
I remember...

47:07.064 --> 47:10.000
standing on fifth Avenue
in front of fao Schwarz.

47:10.067 --> 47:14.037
And it was snowing and Windy
and my feet were freezing,

47:14.104 --> 47:16.073
and I wanted to go back
to the hotel.

47:18.609 --> 47:22.245
You were staring
in a store window
at the christmas display,

47:22.312 --> 47:24.881
and you looked
so beautiful.

47:24.948 --> 47:28.652
So... innocent
and so childlike.

47:28.719 --> 47:32.322
You turned around and caught me
looking at you, and you said,

47:32.389 --> 47:35.892
"Hey, don't be sad.
It's christmas,

47:35.959 --> 47:37.894
and we've got each other."

47:37.961 --> 47:40.998
and then you hugged me.

47:41.064 --> 47:43.033
You held me really tight.

47:46.169 --> 47:49.206
And the more
we held on to each other,
the quieter it got.

47:51.742 --> 47:54.811
All the traffic sounds
disappeared.

47:54.878 --> 47:59.483
And the only thing I could hear
was the sound of your breathing.

47:59.549 --> 48:01.885
<i>I have never
felt that connected...</i>

48:01.952 --> 48:05.155
<i>to another human being
before... or Since.</i>

48:06.823 --> 48:09.826
It was the single most
perfect moment of my life.

48:14.364 --> 48:16.266
No, Ben.

49:01.845 --> 49:03.013
[ mews ]
