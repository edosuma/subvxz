00:02.612 --> 00:03.770
Your nurse is here.

00:03.820 --> 00:04.839
Your wrist, please.

00:04.846 --> 00:07.605
Are you always so impertinent?
I'm simply doing my job.

00:07.814 --> 00:09.293
I didn't catch your name.

00:09.295 --> 00:10.853
Adams.

00:10.855 --> 00:11.975
Sister Adams.

00:12.575 --> 00:14.975
This isn't a situation
I expected to find myself in.

00:16.055 --> 00:17.733
He doesn't need it.

00:17.735 --> 00:19.895
I'm not a bloody child.

00:24.295 --> 00:25.453
James.

00:25.455 --> 00:26.775
James! No!

00:32.015 --> 00:35.333
Did you tell her why you did this?

00:35.335 --> 00:37.813
No-one else is to know about this.

00:37.815 --> 00:38.975
No-one.

00:39.215 --> 00:41.453
On the boat.
Forget the boat.

00:41.455 --> 00:43.215
I thought you'd wished
you'd never married me.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.893
I missed you.

00:45.895 --> 00:47.255
I missed you too.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.413
I was glad
to receive your letter.

00:52.415 --> 00:54.413
The hospital will be lucky
to have you.

00:54.415 --> 00:55.773
If they want me, that is.

00:55.775 --> 00:58.493
I don't want him
employing the Adams woman.

00:58.495 --> 01:00.053
She said she'd be discreet.

01:00.055 --> 01:03.093
Well, she contacted George
because she has no other options.

01:03.095 --> 01:05.013
She will scuttle off
as soon as possible,

01:05.015 --> 01:08.293
and you'll just have to train
someone all over again.

01:08.295 --> 01:10.173
The job's yours if you want it.

01:10.175 --> 01:12.893
I thought I made my wishes clear.

01:12.895 --> 01:14.613
No, you misrepresented her.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.597
The fact that I want it
should suffice.

01:17.909 --> 01:19.147
Not this time.

01:19.149 --> 01:22.987
I would like to pay
your return passage to England.

01:22.989 --> 01:24.187
Did you speak to Dr Duncan?

01:24.189 --> 01:25.827
Did you encourage him against me?

01:25.829 --> 01:27.187
That is a very generous offer.

01:27.189 --> 01:28.827
You would be a fool not to accept.

01:28.829 --> 01:30.469
And you'd be a fool
to think I would.

02:07.341 --> 02:09.419
The most popular song
in the country.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.598
You have to wonder.

02:10.670 --> 02:12.389
I think HE likes it.

02:12.391 --> 02:15.351
Now, Doris Collins is the closest
thing Inverness has to a town crier.

02:18.831 --> 02:19.829
Last try.

02:19.831 --> 02:21.631
If you stay in the cottage,
you get to look after him.

02:22.671 --> 02:24.669
He can look after himself.

02:24.671 --> 02:26.509
Can't you, boy?
Be a weight off my mind.

02:26.511 --> 02:27.671
But not your mother's.

02:28.831 --> 02:31.149
I stopped taking orders
from my mother years ago.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.189
Why exacerbate the problem,
Mr Bligh?

02:33.191 --> 02:35.151
I tried. Please.

02:37.751 --> 02:40.029
One thing I do insist on, though.

02:40.031 --> 02:41.351
Call me George.

02:43.911 --> 02:45.391
Don't be a stranger.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.951
Bye, dog.

02:49.431 --> 02:50.431
Thanks again.

02:52.231 --> 02:53.271
George.

02:55.471 --> 02:57.869
It must be Miss Adams!

02:57.871 --> 02:59.829
Of course, it is Sarah.

02:59.831 --> 03:02.549
Dropped off by Mr Bligh himself.

03:02.551 --> 03:03.869
Goodness me.

03:03.871 --> 03:04.989
I'm Doris Collins.

03:04.991 --> 03:08.429
Call me Doris. I don't stand
on ceremony with my young girls.

03:08.431 --> 03:10.151
Come in. Welcome. Welcome.

03:11.551 --> 03:14.151
We met the Blighs in London, did we?
No.

03:15.551 --> 03:17.309
On the ship home.

03:17.311 --> 03:18.669
Oh, you don't say!

03:18.671 --> 03:20.789
As you can see, simple but clean.

03:20.791 --> 03:22.269
That's my motto.

03:22.271 --> 03:24.589
They had cause for a nurse,
did they?

03:24.591 --> 03:27.069
Sorry?
The Blighs on the boat.

03:27.071 --> 03:28.949
Otherwise it seems a bit odd,
doesn't it?

03:28.951 --> 03:32.109
No offence, dear,
but nurses don't travel top deck.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.229
I worked my passage.

03:34.231 --> 03:35.391
Is that the room?

03:42.631 --> 03:44.231
You look like the sun up there.

03:45.671 --> 03:47.471
Oh, that's corny.

03:48.791 --> 03:50.909
My own sun.

03:50.911 --> 03:52.791
Mi sole mio.

03:55.631 --> 03:57.711
Get away!

04:00.111 --> 04:01.429
I missed you so much.

04:01.431 --> 04:02.749
The hundredth time you've said.

04:02.751 --> 04:04.269
At least a thousand times
I've thought it!

04:04.271 --> 04:06.749
Well, go away more often.
It makes you romantic.

04:06.751 --> 04:08.791
But...

04:10.871 --> 04:11.911
I don't deserve you.

04:12.871 --> 04:14.469
Why?

04:14.471 --> 04:16.789
I can't tell my family about you.

04:16.791 --> 04:17.949
I'm a coward.

04:17.951 --> 04:19.548
Don't say that.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.751
If Gran doesn't think Sarah fits in,
what hope do we have?

04:24.391 --> 04:25.751
You like this Sarah?

04:26.751 --> 04:28.309
Very much.

04:28.311 --> 04:31.711
She's... different from anyone
I've ever met.

04:33.071 --> 04:34.389
She can stand up to Grandmother.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.031
Some day I will too.

04:37.751 --> 04:41.271
I'll stand before your family
and say how I feel about you.

04:42.791 --> 04:44.031
How DO you feel about me?

04:46.911 --> 04:48.149
You know.

04:48.151 --> 04:49.149
No, I kn...

04:49.151 --> 04:50.791
Ah! Ow!

05:12.391 --> 05:14.151
Come in.

05:15.471 --> 05:16.509
Grub's up.

05:16.511 --> 05:17.749
I thought we could go in together.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.669
I'd like that. Thank you.

05:19.671 --> 05:21.469
I'm Alma.

05:21.471 --> 05:24.029
Don't let the grass grow under you,
Sarah.

05:24.031 --> 05:25.149
This is Maude.

05:25.151 --> 05:26.949
And Alma I see you've met.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.029
I'm the theatre nurse.

05:28.031 --> 05:29.469
In charge of wards, me.

05:29.471 --> 05:30.669
Dig in.

05:30.671 --> 05:32.109
Doris is a bottler in the kitchen.

05:32.111 --> 05:34.549
And very nice of you to say so,
Alma, dear.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.109
If a little crudely.

05:36.111 --> 05:37.869
So you're the new community nurse?
Yes.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.189
She's just arrived from London.

05:40.191 --> 05:42.149
Good friend of Mr Bligh's.

05:42.151 --> 05:43.749
It was his idea to take the job,
was it?

05:43.751 --> 05:44.749
He mentioned it.

05:44.751 --> 05:45.909
I thought as much.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.949
What a fine man.

05:47.951 --> 05:49.469
Great catch for somebody.

05:49.471 --> 05:51.431
Not that you're thinking that way,
of course.

05:52.591 --> 05:54.389
I hear you're joining us on stage.

05:54.391 --> 05:57.269
I was going to let you settle
before I mentioned it.

05:57.271 --> 05:59.309
A charity matinee.

05:59.311 --> 06:01.109
I've already told the committee
ladies you would.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.229
Would what?

06:02.231 --> 06:05.309
We're doing a number
from 'The Mikado'.

06:05.311 --> 06:07.029
You sing? I'm sure you do.

06:07.031 --> 06:09.229
You look as if you must.
You'll pick it up.

06:09.231 --> 06:12.469
Anyway, it's for the hospital fund,
so I won't take no for an answer.

06:12.471 --> 06:13.829
Well, if it's for a good cause.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.389
As long as it's not on Sunday.
My aunt is visiting.

06:16.391 --> 06:19.309
Theatricals on the Lord's day
is hardly seemly.

06:19.311 --> 06:20.589
It's Saturday.

06:20.591 --> 06:22.949
I'd love to meet your aunt.

06:22.951 --> 06:24.309
She could dine with us.

06:24.311 --> 06:26.109
Oh, that's kind but unnecessary.

06:26.111 --> 06:27.309
No, it's no trouble.

06:27.311 --> 06:29.029
We're all one happy family here.

06:29.031 --> 06:30.109
We'd love to meet her.

06:30.111 --> 06:32.469
No, I insist.
I insist.

06:32.471 --> 06:34.311
We'll have tea out.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.829
Mmm.

06:39.831 --> 06:41.591
Delicious.

06:43.831 --> 06:45.669
So where did you end up
taking Sarah?

06:45.671 --> 06:49.389
Miss Adams wanted me to take her
to Doris Collins' house today.

06:49.391 --> 06:50.589
Doris Co...

06:50.591 --> 06:54.109
Why anyone would choose to live with
Doris Collins is beyond me.

06:54.111 --> 06:56.389
It's her decision.
She's a grown woman.

06:56.391 --> 06:58.029
We should have her for dinner
now and then.

06:58.031 --> 06:59.589
Give her some relief.

06:59.591 --> 07:01.829
Wouldn't you agree, Father?

07:01.831 --> 07:04.389
If she's doing her job properly,
I doubt she'll have time.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.749
Mother, she's a nurse,
not the prime minister.

07:06.751 --> 07:08.669
I don't understand your problem.

07:08.671 --> 07:11.749
I simply don't share your compulsion
to embrace her as a friend.

07:11.751 --> 07:12.909
We barely know her.

07:12.911 --> 07:15.589
And traditionally that's why
you invite someone to dinner.

07:15.591 --> 07:17.269
To get to know them.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.949
We found her a job, a place to stay.

07:19.951 --> 07:21.189
I think that's enough.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.469
She found herself the job
and she's moved out.

07:23.471 --> 07:25.669
Why do I get the feeling
there's more to this?

07:25.671 --> 07:26.909
I agree.

07:26.911 --> 07:28.469
Must be hard for her.

07:28.471 --> 07:29.791
You should have her up.

07:32.391 --> 07:34.229
You feeling better, Olivia?

07:34.231 --> 07:35.749
A little, actually. Thank you.

07:35.751 --> 07:36.791
Wonderful.

07:37.471 --> 07:38.471
Cards, I think.

07:39.551 --> 07:40.949
Who's joining me?

07:40.951 --> 07:41.991
James?

07:49.831 --> 07:51.751
I'm glad we sorted that out.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.229
About Sarah Adams...
Yes.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.469
I do understand the situation.

08:03.471 --> 08:05.029
You don't want her
raising suspicion.

08:05.031 --> 08:06.029
Exactly.

08:06.031 --> 08:08.549
The only person doing that
right now is you.

08:08.551 --> 08:10.549
It's your hostility
that's causing comment.

08:10.551 --> 08:12.749
Like it or not, she's here.
We have to live with it.

08:12.751 --> 08:14.189
By making her part of the furniture?

08:14.191 --> 08:16.669
Not by acting like she's
Frankenstein's monster.

08:16.671 --> 08:19.669
All that does is encourages
speculation you're so afraid of.

08:19.671 --> 08:22.871
And denying people what they want
hasn't really worked so far, has it?

08:24.471 --> 08:26.309
Hello, my darling. Come in.

08:26.311 --> 08:27.829
Canasta or bridge?

08:27.831 --> 08:29.029
I'm not interrupting?

08:29.031 --> 08:30.389
Oh, nothing of importance.

08:30.391 --> 08:32.351
James was just being a scold.

08:33.551 --> 08:34.549
And here's our fourth.

08:34.551 --> 08:36.469
Bridge, I think.

08:36.471 --> 08:38.389
Perhaps you were right, Anna.

08:38.390 --> 08:39.591
About?

08:40.751 --> 08:43.029
Miss Adams probably would
enjoy some company,

08:43.030 --> 08:44.471
if she can find the time.

08:45.671 --> 08:48.671
I've even thought of a nice way
to welcome her to the town.

08:50.111 --> 08:51.749
James?

08:51.751 --> 08:52.791
Hmm?

08:54.391 --> 08:59.389
Does it seem odd, your grandmother's
attitude tonight about Sarah Adams?

08:59.391 --> 09:02.031
Nah. She's never short of opinions.

09:03.391 --> 09:05.391
It was more her about-face.

09:07.471 --> 09:08.549
Do you know anything about it?

09:08.551 --> 09:10.109
Her reasons, I mean.

09:10.111 --> 09:12.151
Why would I?
I just...

09:13.551 --> 09:14.671
wondered.

09:16.031 --> 09:17.029
It's none of my business.

09:17.031 --> 09:19.029
Obviously Father and Anna
made their case.

09:19.031 --> 09:20.311
She's not unreasonable.

09:22.391 --> 09:24.551
I thought you looked lovely tonight,
by the way.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.431
I did?

09:30.031 --> 09:31.031
Really beautiful.

10:08.911 --> 10:10.269
Can I help you, Mrs Collins?

10:10.271 --> 10:11.949
Oh, there you are!

10:11.951 --> 10:15.469
I knocked first.
This just came for you.

10:15.471 --> 10:18.269
I thought I'd leave it on the bed
for privacy.

10:18.271 --> 10:19.271
Thank you.

10:20.271 --> 10:24.831
It was hand-delivered by Norman,
the Blighs' man.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.029
I'm afraid I won't be able
to join you for the song after all.

10:30.031 --> 10:32.549
I've been invited to
the concert as their guest.

10:32.551 --> 10:34.471
What? An afternoon with Mr Bligh?

10:35.751 --> 10:37.911
Aren't you the lucky one?
Not quite.

10:40.111 --> 10:41.111
Mrs Bligh.

10:43.031 --> 10:44.031
Well.

10:45.031 --> 10:46.071
That is an honour.

11:10.191 --> 11:14.311
Thanks to
the Evelyn Hutchins Dance Academy!

11:15.591 --> 11:18.071
Could be a special on
sprained ankles after that, girls.

11:19.151 --> 11:20.869
And now a recitation.

11:20.871 --> 11:25.391
Let's hear it for Roy Briggs,
our master of the bush ballad.

11:30.991 --> 11:35.069
'How We Beat the Favourite',
in 25 verses.

11:35.071 --> 11:36.231
Verse one.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.991
And that's
a sulphur-crested cockatoo.

11:52.471 --> 11:54.951
♪ Three little maids from school

11:57.471 --> 11:59.629
♪ Three little maids who, all unwary

11:59.631 --> 12:01.469

12:04.431 --> 12:08.191

12:22.271 --> 12:23.389
So glad you could come.

12:23.391 --> 12:24.389
Me too.

12:24.391 --> 12:25.669
It's great to see you again.

12:25.671 --> 12:28.269
I meant to come up to the cottage
before you left.

12:28.271 --> 12:30.389
Would you like to go riding
some time?

12:30.391 --> 12:32.349
I could teach you.
We've got lots of quiet horses!

12:32.351 --> 12:34.229
That's OK. I can ride.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.909
Really?
Yeah.

12:35.911 --> 12:37.469
Come up, uh, tomorrow, then.

12:37.471 --> 12:39.109
I can lend you any gear
you might need.

12:39.111 --> 12:42.309
It'll be just like the night
on the ship, only... jodhpurs.

12:42.311 --> 12:43.669
I would love that.

12:43.671 --> 12:45.989
Who said we left
the arts behind in Europe?

12:45.991 --> 12:47.389
Charming.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.269
Now say it as if you mean it.

12:49.271 --> 12:50.909
I should introduce you around.
Are you up to it?

12:50.911 --> 12:51.909
Of course.

12:51.911 --> 12:53.109
Shall I get us drinks?

12:53.111 --> 12:54.151
Thank you.
Yes.

12:56.671 --> 12:59.269
I appreciate the invitation.

12:59.271 --> 13:00.311
Oh, you're most welcome.

13:01.631 --> 13:02.669
Can I be direct?

13:02.671 --> 13:04.829
When have you been otherwise?

13:04.831 --> 13:06.151
I didn't stay to spite you.

13:06.831 --> 13:08.989
I'd like us to start again.

13:08.991 --> 13:10.549
Lovely to meet you too.

13:10.551 --> 13:13.469
You're threatened by what
I know about James.

13:13.471 --> 13:15.829
James is doing perfectly well.

13:15.831 --> 13:20.029
I don't know that a suicidal
tendency is so easily fixed.

13:20.031 --> 13:21.109
In this case it is.

13:21.111 --> 13:24.389
And if I should happen to be wrong,
my eye is on him always.

13:24.391 --> 13:26.389
Well, then you have nothing to fear.

13:26.391 --> 13:29.189
I'd only share what I know
for his wellbeing.

13:29.191 --> 13:33.269
Good. Then there will be no need
for you to break the confidence.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.511
Whose idea was this invitation?

13:36.551 --> 13:38.469
Mine.

13:38.471 --> 13:40.629
As you say, a new beginning.

13:40.631 --> 13:42.111
If you'll excuse me.

13:51.791 --> 13:53.111
Thank you.

13:56.439 --> 13:59.137
Doris said it was nearly
four little mates from school.

13:59.154 --> 14:02.992
Yes, with my voice, the audience
are lucky it stayed at three.

14:02.994 --> 14:04.594
The Blighs are looking after you,
I see.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.912
I thought I showed you
I don't need looking after.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.594
Excuse me.
Sister...

14:11.235 --> 14:13.873
Country town has
its class structures

14:13.875 --> 14:15.595
just as much as where
you've come from.

14:16.675 --> 14:19.673
The Blighs are the closest thing
we have to royalty.

14:19.675 --> 14:21.273
First impressions count.

14:21.275 --> 14:23.073
You'll have
your work cut out for you

14:23.075 --> 14:24.873
if people think you're above them.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.393
I see.

14:26.395 --> 14:27.995
And you look very nice, by the way.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.073
Pardon?

14:30.075 --> 14:31.675
As it sounds.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.073
Everything alright?

14:38.075 --> 14:40.513
He's a particular kind of man,
isn't he?

14:40.515 --> 14:41.873
He's a fine doctor, though.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.353
I don't doubt it.

14:43.355 --> 14:44.673
I'll be back in a moment.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.155
I might have a small favour to ask.

14:52.035 --> 14:54.113
I liked your poem, Roy.

14:54.115 --> 14:55.673
It's not called a poem, see.

14:55.675 --> 14:57.633
It's a bush ballad.

14:57.635 --> 14:58.635
Sorry.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.595
I was wondering...

15:03.155 --> 15:05.355
Just up here.
Well, I do owe you one.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.673
Uh, do you mind, miss?
Oh! Course not.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.795
Thank you.

15:13.235 --> 15:15.673
What about the old girl?

15:15.675 --> 15:17.875
After your bush ballad, Roy,
I'm sure she'll be honoured.

15:26.155 --> 15:27.753
I'll explain.

15:27.755 --> 15:30.515
That's not gonna help her cause
with Grandmother.

15:33.395 --> 15:34.393
Are you alright?

15:34.395 --> 15:35.995
Just a little warm.

15:48.795 --> 15:55.953
♪ Che bella cosa

15:55.955 --> 16:02.473
♪ Naria serena

I shouldn't have come.

16:58.755 --> 17:00.193
I just...

17:00.195 --> 17:02.673
I thought I was over all of this.

17:02.675 --> 17:04.553
Your results are in.

17:04.555 --> 17:06.032
Didn't open.

17:06.035 --> 17:07.792
I'm sure they'll tell the tale.

17:07.795 --> 17:08.875
Do you really think so?

17:09.954 --> 17:11.075
Here you go.

17:13.395 --> 17:15.153
What have you eaten today?

17:15.155 --> 17:16.953
I can't keep anything down, really.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.234
Here we are.

17:19.315 --> 17:20.313
Now drink this.

17:20.315 --> 17:21.953
The sugar will help
until you can eat.

17:21.954 --> 17:23.515
You'll see to that?
Yes.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.113
It's time for your speech.

17:26.115 --> 17:27.153
It can wait.

17:27.155 --> 17:29.393
Don't stay on my behalf, honestly.

17:29.395 --> 17:31.113
I'm feeling much better.

17:31.115 --> 17:32.155
You're sure?

17:33.555 --> 17:35.393
Come and see me tomorrow.

17:35.395 --> 17:37.273
I'll be in my office all afternoon.

17:37.275 --> 17:38.315
Any time.

17:44.115 --> 17:46.715
I'm starting to feel quite silly.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.315
Gino Poletti
with Armo on the squeezebox.

17:54.755 --> 17:56.273
You know what
they say about those Italians.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.433
They've got a way with a song.

17:57.435 --> 17:59.515
Just wish we knew what
they were singing about.

18:01.115 --> 18:02.635
Right, well, I'll keep it short.

18:04.035 --> 18:05.435
Thank you for coming.

18:09.195 --> 18:12.673
Uh, we've raised a fair whack
for the hospital, so thank you.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.755
All for another night on the town
for you, eh, Jack?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.113
If there's any left over, Roy.

18:18.115 --> 18:19.273
While I'm here,

18:19.275 --> 18:22.673
I might as well introduce
our newest member of staff.

18:22.675 --> 18:23.755
Stand up, Sarah.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.193
Come on. Don't be shy.

18:26.195 --> 18:28.033
She's the one who fixed my leg up.

18:28.035 --> 18:32.113
Sister Adams will be starting soon
as our new community nurse.

18:32.115 --> 18:35.795
So I hope you all make her feel
right at home. Hmm?

18:55.835 --> 18:56.953
Oh!

18:56.955 --> 18:59.033
That's our cultural duty
done for a while.

18:59.035 --> 19:00.113
Using the term very loosely.

19:00.115 --> 19:02.475
Duty?
Culture.

19:07.515 --> 19:09.113
We'll take dinner in our room
if you don't mind.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.833
Oh, not at all.

19:10.835 --> 19:12.473
Are you sure you're feeling alright?

19:12.475 --> 19:13.673
I'm fine. Thank you.

19:13.675 --> 19:15.513
You rest.
If there's anything you need...

19:15.515 --> 19:18.113
Have I got time for a bath
before dinner?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.593
I am happy to delay dinner
if you are, George?

19:20.595 --> 19:21.953
After being force-fed by the CWA.

19:21.955 --> 19:23.913
I'll let Cook know.

19:23.915 --> 19:26.155
Goody. Time for a long soak.

19:27.155 --> 19:28.753
You're rather cheerful for someone

19:28.755 --> 19:31.913
drawn into Miss Adams' game
of musical chairs.

19:31.915 --> 19:34.233
You do understand
what she was doing?

19:34.235 --> 19:35.833
Yeah, your father explained.

19:35.835 --> 19:38.393
But it simply highlights exactly
what I've been saying.

19:38.395 --> 19:41.193
Including her in our world
is not doing her any favours.

19:41.195 --> 19:44.075
This is 1953, Grandmother.

19:45.035 --> 19:47.593
Some standards are timeless.

19:47.595 --> 19:49.673
I shudder to think of
the long-term effects

19:49.675 --> 19:51.475
of unfettered social mobility.

19:53.515 --> 19:56.153
I don't see why that's funny.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.635
That's what makes it funny.

20:00.035 --> 20:01.515
You're becoming cheeky, madam.

20:02.515 --> 20:04.593
I know.

20:04.595 --> 20:07.473
What did you think of
Gino Poletti's song?

20:07.475 --> 20:08.473
Oh, well...

20:08.475 --> 20:09.753
Yeah, he has a lovely voice.

20:09.755 --> 20:11.995
Rather wasted on a simple farmer.

20:31.035 --> 20:32.075
I'm worried about you.

20:33.195 --> 20:35.033
I'm fine.

20:35.035 --> 20:36.753
Really.

20:36.755 --> 20:37.755
Are you happy?

20:40.755 --> 20:42.313
Of course I am.

20:42.315 --> 20:43.673
Because I want you to be.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.833
I do.

20:44.835 --> 20:45.915
You know I love you.

20:55.395 --> 20:56.835
Show me.

21:01.395 --> 21:02.675
I want you.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.115
I'm alright.

21:09.275 --> 21:10.435
Please.

21:34.555 --> 21:37.113
You ride really well for a nurse.

21:37.115 --> 21:39.473
How are nurses meant to ride?

21:39.475 --> 21:40.913
Where did you learn?

21:40.915 --> 21:42.233
In Spain.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.675
Race you to that tree.

21:55.755 --> 21:56.835
It's wonderful here.

21:58.955 --> 22:01.355
So you lived in Spain for a time?

22:03.315 --> 22:06.553
I was a nurse during
the Spanish civil war.

22:06.555 --> 22:08.835
Was that terrible?
Yes.

22:11.115 --> 22:14.395
It's where I met my husband,
so it's not all bad memories.

22:17.555 --> 22:19.035
He passed away.

22:23.315 --> 22:25.193
"O sole mio."

22:25.195 --> 22:26.953
Should I ask?

22:26.955 --> 22:28.193
Sorry?

22:28.195 --> 22:30.193
You seem very taken with
the singer yesterday.

22:30.195 --> 22:31.995
Gino?
Yes.

22:33.195 --> 22:34.873
Do you understand Italian?

22:34.875 --> 22:35.915
Tell me.

22:37.675 --> 22:40.393
"O sole. O sole mio."

22:40.395 --> 22:43.393
The sun. My own sun.

22:43.395 --> 22:46.393
"Sta 'nfronte a te.
Sta 'nfronte a te."

22:46.395 --> 22:47.913
It's upon your face.

22:47.915 --> 22:48.955
It's...

22:50.035 --> 22:52.113
Anna.

22:52.115 --> 22:53.753
I'm fine.

22:53.755 --> 22:55.595
He's just a friend.

22:56.595 --> 22:57.875
Alright.

22:59.955 --> 23:01.753
Is it that obvious?

23:01.755 --> 23:04.553
For anyone who understood the words.

23:04.555 --> 23:06.595
Oh, thank God none of them
know Italian.

23:07.755 --> 23:09.275
They'd stop it.

23:12.275 --> 23:16.833
To them, he's just a farmer,
and I'd be just a fool.

23:16.835 --> 23:18.835
Your father might surprise you.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.355
Gran wouldn't.

23:34.395 --> 23:36.673
You did very well with
Sarah Adams yesterday.

23:36.675 --> 23:38.193
I fulfilled my obligations.

23:38.195 --> 23:39.393
For now.

23:39.395 --> 23:41.953
We should have her up for dinner
once she's settled.

23:41.955 --> 23:44.593
Jack Duncan made a good point
about community acceptance.

23:44.595 --> 23:46.715
All the more reason
to entertain her privately.

23:48.115 --> 23:50.115
Perhaps I'll ask Roy Briggs
to join us.

23:52.195 --> 23:53.875
Your sense of humour
is rather perverse.

23:55.195 --> 23:56.755
I would like to have her to dine.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.675
I can keep a secret, you know.

24:06.275 --> 24:07.835
I wish
it didn't have to be one.

24:09.115 --> 24:13.113
Gino promised he'd say how he felt
about me in front of everyone,

24:13.115 --> 24:14.473
and he did.

24:14.475 --> 24:16.715
Even if he sang it
and they didn't understand.

24:18.275 --> 24:20.673
I'm going to end up like James.

24:20.675 --> 24:22.753
He only married Olivia
because he had to.

24:22.755 --> 24:24.273
Because Grandmother made him.

24:24.275 --> 24:25.833
You sure of that?

24:25.835 --> 24:27.393
I have no proof,

24:27.395 --> 24:30.753
but I think he had a girlfriend
in England they didn't approve of.

24:30.755 --> 24:33.393
Olivia was just
his best friend's sister.

24:33.395 --> 24:35.913
He never even mentioned her
in four years,

24:35.915 --> 24:37.833
and suddenly they're married.

24:37.835 --> 24:42.035
He's miserable and
we have an aristocrat in the family.

24:46.395 --> 24:48.075
Mercury!
Anna!

24:49.275 --> 24:51.875
Whoa! Whoa!

25:04.035 --> 25:05.473
Mercury.

25:05.475 --> 25:06.633
Are you alright?

25:06.635 --> 25:08.315
Yes. Yes, I think so.

25:10.035 --> 25:12.033
Oh.

25:12.035 --> 25:14.235
No. No. No, don't be hurt.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.235
Oh, we have to get him to a vet!

25:21.195 --> 25:22.553
His leg is broken.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.593
We have to get the truck
and we have to move him!

25:24.595 --> 25:26.435
The vet can fix him!

25:30.035 --> 25:31.115
We can't do nothing!

25:36.915 --> 25:38.075
Stay here.

25:39.875 --> 25:40.875
It's OK.

25:52.915 --> 25:54.833
No! What are you doing?

25:54.835 --> 25:56.353
He's in agony.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.953
No.
It's not fair to let him suffer.

25:57.955 --> 25:59.515
Walk away.

26:20.636 --> 26:22.054
Oh, hello, Mildred.

26:22.055 --> 26:24.615
Could you put me through
to Doris Collins, please?

26:30.917 --> 26:31.957
Hello?

26:32.637 --> 26:33.757
Mrs Collins.

26:34.820 --> 26:35.978
Mrs Bligh?

26:35.980 --> 26:37.858
I hope I haven't caught
you at an awkward moment.

26:37.860 --> 26:39.578
Oh, no. Goodness me, no.

26:39.580 --> 26:41.898
Let me congratulate you
on your yum yum.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.418
Oh, thank you!

26:44.501 --> 26:46.459
Now, I was hoping perhaps
I could come in

26:46.461 --> 26:47.859
for a little chat this afternoon.

26:47.861 --> 26:49.139
With me?

26:49.141 --> 26:51.099
If it's not inconvenient.

26:51.101 --> 26:52.699
Oh, dear.

26:52.701 --> 26:54.219
I'm terribly... Look...

26:54.221 --> 26:57.299
It's just that I promised the ladies
I'd go back down to the hall

26:57.301 --> 26:58.619
and help the clean-up.

26:58.621 --> 27:01.739
Well, of course,
I'd like to thank them too.

27:01.741 --> 27:03.379
Perhaps I could come to the hall?

27:03.381 --> 27:04.979
If it's not inconvenient.

27:04.981 --> 27:06.739
No. No, not at all.

27:06.741 --> 27:08.099
I'll let the ladies know.

27:08.101 --> 27:10.539
Very good. As long as we can
have our moment alone.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.701
Absolutely. Goodbye for n...

27:13.821 --> 27:15.219
Off to town?

27:15.221 --> 27:16.701
Yes. Do you need anything?

27:17.701 --> 27:19.221
Sir. There's been an accident.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.459
What happened?

27:22.461 --> 27:24.619
Her horse startled
and ran through a fence.

27:24.621 --> 27:26.299
Sarah had to put him down!

27:26.301 --> 27:27.899
At whose suggestion?

27:27.901 --> 27:29.059
It was the only thing to do.

27:29.061 --> 27:31.139
I didn't realise you were also
a veterinarian.

27:31.141 --> 27:33.021
See to Anna, Mother. I'll be in.

27:34.541 --> 27:36.459
The leg was broken through.
I'll take you to him.

27:36.461 --> 27:37.659
No, you don't need
to see that again.

27:37.661 --> 27:39.859
Glen, will you stay with the horse
and find James?

27:39.861 --> 27:41.059
You weren't hurt?
Anna was thrown.

27:41.061 --> 27:43.619
She seems fine, but perhaps
Dr Duncan should double-check.

27:43.621 --> 27:44.619
Won't you come inside?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.379
No, I'll get back.
I'll get the car.

27:46.381 --> 27:48.141
I'd like the walk.
Thank you, anyway.

27:50.701 --> 27:54.099
She asked me to walk away,
and so I did, and...

27:54.101 --> 27:55.301
and then she shot him.

27:56.621 --> 27:59.739
But I didn't see it
and she didn't do anything wrong.

27:59.741 --> 28:00.819
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:00.821 --> 28:02.659
You don't need to defend her.

28:02.661 --> 28:05.179
Do you have any idea what
Mercury was worth?

28:05.181 --> 28:06.179
Nothing lame.

28:06.181 --> 28:07.659
Are you alright?
Sarah said you were thrown.

28:07.661 --> 28:08.819
No, I'm fine.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.219
It's just a shock.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.939
I still think you should go
and lie down.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.699
I'll be up to check on you soon.

28:13.701 --> 28:15.101
Come on.

28:20.381 --> 28:22.661
Calm as you like.

28:23.821 --> 28:26.379
The woman fetches a gun,
tells Anna to walk away

28:26.381 --> 28:27.659
and pulls the trigger.

28:27.661 --> 28:29.179
Which is exactly what
I would have done.

28:29.181 --> 28:31.379
You're a landowner, George.
What's your point?

28:31.381 --> 28:34.579
She is a middle-aged nurse
who's been living in London,

28:34.581 --> 28:36.379
who somehow rides like a stockman

28:36.381 --> 28:39.219
and handles shotguns
without a moment's hesitation.

28:39.221 --> 28:40.421
And so what?

28:41.221 --> 28:43.379
We don't know anything about her.

28:43.381 --> 28:44.459
We do.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.019
We know that she just
looked after Anna,

28:46.021 --> 28:48.099
and all you can do is vilify her.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.179
She deserves better.

28:49.181 --> 28:50.859
Who is she, George?

28:50.861 --> 28:52.699
How many times do I have to say it?

28:52.701 --> 28:54.501
We have no idea who she is.

28:57.541 --> 28:59.221
I'll look after the burial.

29:07.741 --> 29:08.739
There you are!

29:08.741 --> 29:10.539
What time does your aunt get in?
Oh, my!

29:10.541 --> 29:12.699
You look as though you've had
a run through an abattoir.

29:12.701 --> 29:14.539
I won't be needing afternoon tea.

29:14.541 --> 29:16.899
We discussed this.
Has there been an accident?

29:16.901 --> 29:19.179
Don't tell me it happened
on your ride with young Miss Bligh!

29:19.181 --> 29:20.979
Mrs Collins!

29:20.981 --> 29:22.941
If I want to tell you more, I will.

29:25.341 --> 29:27.099
Sorry.

29:27.101 --> 29:28.299
That was uncalled for.

29:28.301 --> 29:30.619
Oh, no. I have to run.

29:30.621 --> 29:31.699
I've put myself at risk

29:31.701 --> 29:33.259
of being very late
for an important rendezvous

29:33.261 --> 29:34.819
by doing this.

29:34.821 --> 29:37.019
If you change your mind,
it'll be there on the table,

29:37.021 --> 29:39.141
set for just the two of you,
of course.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.019
Gino!

29:49.021 --> 29:50.221
Where have you been?

29:53.821 --> 29:55.581
It's Mercury.

29:56.701 --> 29:57.821
What's happened?

29:59.221 --> 30:00.701
He broke a leg.

30:01.821 --> 30:04.459
We had to put him down.

30:04.461 --> 30:06.299
And I can't stop crying.

30:06.301 --> 30:08.301
Shh. Hey.

30:11.941 --> 30:15.221
Mama says,
"If you can't cry, you can't feel."

30:16.821 --> 30:19.541
I...I...

30:22.941 --> 30:23.939
I love you so much.

30:23.941 --> 30:25.219
You don't have to say it.

30:25.221 --> 30:27.661
No. No, I should have said it
well before now.

30:28.741 --> 30:29.861
You said it now.

30:31.541 --> 30:32.541
I love you.

30:35.461 --> 30:36.581
So much.

30:49.701 --> 30:52.899
It really was a wonderful day.

30:52.901 --> 30:55.379
You all put in so much hard work.

30:55.381 --> 30:59.459
Well, very nice to be
appreciated by someone.

30:59.461 --> 31:03.699
I don't mean to pry
but is Anna alright?

31:03.701 --> 31:06.699
Miss Adams mentioned something
about an accident.

31:06.701 --> 31:09.539
I assumed it must have happened
after we spoke.

31:09.541 --> 31:11.179
Well, thankfully no-one was hurt.

31:11.181 --> 31:16.059
But the good sister did feel
the need to shoot one of our horses.

31:16.061 --> 31:17.299
She never did.

31:17.301 --> 31:20.459
We know so little about the woman.

31:20.461 --> 31:23.781
She does seem to... keep things
to herself, doesn't she?

31:24.941 --> 31:26.301
I have wondered about that.

31:26.901 --> 31:27.901
Mmm.

31:28.381 --> 31:30.819
Well, in my experience,
one doesn't guard a door

31:30.821 --> 31:32.941
unless there's something
in the room.

31:34.301 --> 31:36.179
You think she's hiding something?

31:36.181 --> 31:38.259
One can't be too careful.

31:38.261 --> 31:41.819
Well, I'll be sure
to keep my eyes peeled, if it helps.

31:41.821 --> 31:43.661
That is very kind.

31:45.341 --> 31:48.259
I'm positive there's nothing
to worry about.

31:48.261 --> 31:49.461
Oh, no. Me too.

32:20.541 --> 32:22.461
Kill me!

32:35.189 --> 32:37.707
It's pretty bold of you,
just off the boat in a new country

32:37.709 --> 32:39.829
and you slip away
for a pregnancy test.

32:40.909 --> 32:44.227
They were all so focused
on Elizabeth seeing her specialist.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.227
It is easy.

32:45.229 --> 32:46.987
Hardly the actions of
a wilting violet.

32:46.989 --> 32:50.067
Is that how they've
characterised me?

32:50.069 --> 32:52.429
It's how Elizabeth seems to see you.

32:53.709 --> 32:55.389
Perhaps I've earned the title.

32:56.429 --> 32:58.229
It's not me. Not really.

33:03.509 --> 33:04.589
Well?

33:06.669 --> 33:08.469
I'm sure you're going to love
being a mother.

33:12.549 --> 33:13.629
Are they happy tears?

33:16.349 --> 33:18.469
It's been so hard
not to say something.

33:20.029 --> 33:21.629
I didn't want to get their hopes up.

33:23.389 --> 33:25.549
I didn't want to get mine up.

33:33.349 --> 33:35.907
Everything's going to be fine now.

33:35.909 --> 33:37.189
It wasn't?

33:40.709 --> 33:43.389
I'm trying to be a good wife,
but...

33:45.189 --> 33:48.027
I'm just failing everything.

33:48.029 --> 33:49.149
Where'd you get that idea?

33:50.989 --> 33:53.269
I know a disappointed man
when I see one.

33:56.709 --> 34:00.549
I wasn't exactly anyone's
first choice back home.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.669
Then... James...

34:06.669 --> 34:09.627
suddenly seemed to see me
in a different light.

34:09.629 --> 34:12.029
After years of never noticing me.

34:13.109 --> 34:14.589
I was so happy.

34:19.909 --> 34:22.149
And he's been so sad.

34:23.909 --> 34:25.746
But this.

34:25.748 --> 34:27.589
This will make a difference.

34:44.389 --> 34:45.549
Aunty Peg.

34:47.268 --> 34:48.949
Hello, love.

34:51.349 --> 34:53.149
I knew you'd find your feet.

34:55.549 --> 34:57.149
And they're treating you
well enough?

35:00.909 --> 35:02.029
Has Mother asked after me?

35:04.389 --> 35:10.349
No, but now that you're here,
we've got time to mend bridges.

35:11.629 --> 35:12.747
She'll come round.

35:12.749 --> 35:14.549
I wish I shared your confidence.

35:15.269 --> 35:16.747
Don't be like that.

35:16.749 --> 35:17.749
Because time...

35:19.389 --> 35:22.429
time heals every wound.

35:23.829 --> 35:25.547
Look, I've brought you something.

35:25.549 --> 35:26.589
Oh.

35:27.469 --> 35:29.707
Every home needs one.

35:29.709 --> 35:31.309
Thank you.

35:35.989 --> 35:37.309
Thank you.

35:37.989 --> 35:40.387
I'll be sure to put it out
when I find one.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.589
You don't think that could be
here in Inverness?

35:43.749 --> 35:45.109
No, I'm still not sure.

35:46.469 --> 35:48.267
The last time I had
what I call a home

35:48.269 --> 35:50.349
was over 10 years ago in Paris.

35:50.989 --> 35:52.229
You were happy there.

35:54.029 --> 35:55.229
Oh, yes.

35:57.749 --> 35:58.869
We were in love.

36:03.989 --> 36:05.949
And then the Germans came.

36:08.749 --> 36:09.789
Well.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.707
I'm sure you'll find
a spot for that mat.

36:13.709 --> 36:15.347
One day.

36:15.349 --> 36:16.709
You mark my words.

36:48.749 --> 36:51.067
Have you seen James?

36:51.069 --> 36:52.267
Oh, what did Jack say?

36:52.269 --> 36:54.387
It's nothing to worry about.

36:54.389 --> 36:56.547
I can't find him anywhere.

36:56.549 --> 36:58.107
I believe he's at the sheds.

36:58.109 --> 36:59.187
He's not.

36:59.189 --> 37:00.827
Well, I'm sure that's where
he said he'd be.

37:00.829 --> 37:02.987
He did, but they haven't seen him
all morning.

37:02.989 --> 37:05.107
Sorry to interrupt.
I'll keep looking.

37:05.109 --> 37:06.747
No, no, no. You should be resting.

37:06.749 --> 37:08.747
Come on. Sit.

37:08.749 --> 37:10.107
There's fresh tea.

37:10.109 --> 37:11.469
I'll bring him to you.

37:17.549 --> 37:18.829
James!

37:19.829 --> 37:21.629
James!

37:25.749 --> 37:26.949
Oh, James.

37:34.989 --> 37:36.309
James!

37:37.829 --> 37:39.627
James. Oh, God.

37:39.629 --> 37:40.627
Something wrong?

37:40.629 --> 37:42.907
Didn't you hear me?
I've been calling.

37:42.909 --> 37:44.347
You shouldn't be exerting yourself.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.509
I'm not an invalid.

37:46.989 --> 37:48.067
You said you'd be at the sheds.

37:48.069 --> 37:49.389
I couldn't find you.

37:50.709 --> 37:52.029
You didn't think...?

37:54.629 --> 37:55.869
I'm fine.

37:57.669 --> 38:00.069
I'm beyond doing anything foolish.
I promise.

38:09.949 --> 38:11.307
We just finished burying Mercury.

38:11.309 --> 38:12.587
Why didn't you answer when I called?

38:12.589 --> 38:14.269
I didn't hear you.

38:15.309 --> 38:16.349
Don't.

38:16.909 --> 38:17.989
Please.

38:19.789 --> 38:23.587
Your wife is back from the hospital
looking for you.

38:23.589 --> 38:25.069
Get dressed.

38:30.789 --> 38:32.547
I wish you could stay longer.

38:32.549 --> 38:33.827
Next time.

38:33.829 --> 38:35.829
This is a lovely little town.

38:37.989 --> 38:38.989
Give it a go.

38:40.029 --> 38:41.069
We'll see.

38:44.189 --> 38:45.947
What did happen?

38:45.949 --> 38:47.867
During the war?

38:47.869 --> 38:49.629
Not a word for five years.

38:56.789 --> 38:58.069
I lost everything.

38:59.829 --> 39:01.109
They nearly killed me.

39:04.269 --> 39:06.187
It's hard enough to go there
in my mind,

39:06.189 --> 39:07.469
let alone in the telling.

39:12.149 --> 39:14.069
When you can, sweetheart.

39:18.669 --> 39:20.027
There you are.

39:20.029 --> 39:21.627
I was busy with something.

39:21.629 --> 39:22.747
What's happened?

39:22.749 --> 39:26.189
I wanted to tell you alone
but everyone simply arrived.

39:27.749 --> 39:29.267
We're going to have a baby, James.

39:29.269 --> 39:30.467
Oh!

39:30.469 --> 39:32.587
That is wonderful news!

39:32.589 --> 39:34.147
I'm going to be Aunt Anna!

39:34.149 --> 39:35.867
Congratulations.

39:35.869 --> 39:38.627
I'm... gonna be a father?

39:38.629 --> 39:40.067
Champagne with dinner, I think.

39:40.069 --> 39:41.067
Oh, a baby!

39:41.069 --> 39:42.189
Aren't you happy?

39:43.909 --> 39:45.109
James.

39:46.589 --> 39:48.027
Yes.

39:48.029 --> 39:50.549
A hundred times, yes.

40:02.029 --> 40:04.187
Oh, good afternoon, sister.

40:04.189 --> 40:06.867
I trust the visit with your aunt
went well.

40:06.869 --> 40:07.949
Thank you.

40:10.149 --> 40:12.427
My aunt very much
appreciated your effort.

40:12.429 --> 40:13.667
I'm glad.

40:13.669 --> 40:16.387
I'm sure a long, hot soak
is very much in order

40:16.389 --> 40:18.789
after such an eventful day.
It is.

41:21.022 --> 41:22.602
Thought you might
feel like some tea.

41:23.562 --> 41:25.042
Aren't you lovely?

41:31.082 --> 41:33.242
We're gonna have a baby, Livvy.

41:34.602 --> 41:36.720
What do you think it is?
A boy.

41:36.722 --> 41:38.280
I'm sure of it.

41:38.282 --> 41:41.080
I've even started picking names.
Is that silly?

41:41.082 --> 41:42.200
Not at all.

41:42.202 --> 41:43.482
I like William.

41:44.802 --> 41:47.000
I...I think that's perfect.

41:47.002 --> 41:48.240
Your brother will be chuffed.

41:48.242 --> 41:50.080
It's also my father's name,
of course.

41:50.082 --> 41:51.440
I was thinking more of him.

41:51.442 --> 41:53.080
Of course.

41:53.082 --> 41:54.120
How silly of me.

41:54.122 --> 41:55.122
But you're right.

41:56.242 --> 41:58.360
William is your dearest friend.

41:58.362 --> 42:00.122
You must miss him as much as I do.

42:00.802 --> 42:01.802
Sometimes.

42:03.482 --> 42:05.122
William it is.

42:14.562 --> 42:15.842
Can we talk?

42:23.482 --> 42:26.562
The suspicion you had earlier...

42:27.202 --> 42:29.080
I...

42:29.082 --> 42:31.362
I accept that you're past
harming yourself.

42:32.362 --> 42:35.082
I meant the other one.

42:36.002 --> 42:40.200
I want you to know
that I'm going to be a good father

42:40.202 --> 42:42.080
and a good husband.

42:42.082 --> 42:44.720
I know I've disappointed you
and I'll make up for it.

42:44.722 --> 42:45.842
I promise.

42:47.122 --> 42:48.442
I hope so.

42:55.882 --> 42:57.000
Yes. Of course.

42:57.002 --> 42:58.082
She's right here.

42:59.282 --> 43:00.682
Doris Collins for you.

43:01.802 --> 43:03.720
Thank you, James.

43:03.722 --> 43:05.082
I'll take this in private.

43:09.002 --> 43:10.240
Mrs Collins.

43:10.242 --> 43:12.240
I'm sorry to disturb you.

43:12.242 --> 43:13.440
I know you're frightfully busy,

43:13.442 --> 43:19.922
but I've just discovered something
very disturbing about Miss Adams.

43:20.922 --> 43:22.362
Or whoever she is.

43:49.162 --> 43:50.162
Oh.

43:52.082 --> 43:53.440
Our rooms have locks.

43:53.442 --> 43:54.522
I want the key to mine.

43:55.202 --> 43:58.200
I...I can't do that.
It's a house rule.

43:58.202 --> 44:00.240
It may be your house
but it's my room.

44:00.242 --> 44:01.682
I want that key or I leave.

44:16.082 --> 44:18.042
Stay out of my belongings.

44:28.162 --> 44:30.720
Did you do
a background check on her?

44:30.722 --> 44:32.440
Of course.
Her references were in order.

44:32.442 --> 44:33.560
What's the point of this?

44:33.562 --> 44:35.080
The point is,

44:35.082 --> 44:38.920
you checked the references of
a woman called Sarah Adams.

44:38.922 --> 44:41.240
That is not her real name.

44:41.242 --> 44:43.080
So who did we employ, Doctor?

44:43.082 --> 44:44.720
I'll get to the bottom of it,
Elizabeth.

44:44.722 --> 44:46.122
I certainly hope so.

44:46.602 --> 44:49.360
Because it is high time
we knew exactly

44:49.362 --> 44:51.559
who Miss Bridget Adams really is.

44:52.039 --> 45:44.107
