00:23.902 --> 00:25.525
We've been spotted!

00:33.497 --> 00:35.307
The prisoner should be
right over this wall.

00:35.432 --> 00:37.333
I'm gonna go ahead and make
a grand entrance.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.883
I'm Lieutenant Blazer
from the U.S. Special Forces.

00:45.008 --> 00:46.004
I'm here to rescue you.

00:54.303 --> 00:57.265
This is completely against
military protocol...

00:58.660 --> 01:01.228
Girls shouldn't be allowed
to play if they're gonna cry.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.236
Hey guys.

01:05.361 --> 01:06.671
This is Sigourney Beaver.

01:06.796 --> 01:08.944
She is not a sex doll,
she's a real doll.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.644
I'm told she was on set of
<i>Alien: Resurrection.</i>

01:12.769 --> 01:15.617
I have a certificate, so...
Not a sex doll.

01:15.783 --> 01:16.827
All I'm saying is that

01:16.993 --> 01:18.016
you don't charge the mound on a girl.

01:18.141 --> 01:19.246
What if you pop one of her things?

01:19.412 --> 01:20.956
There's no crying in softball.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.527
She's not a sex doll.

01:37.714 --> 01:39.433
I love that hat.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.308
Why, thank you.

01:40.474 --> 01:43.275
They gave it to me 'cause I'm
the top sales gun of the month.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.410
It's like an honor that
they bestow upon

01:45.535 --> 01:47.816
just one guy a month.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.915
I thought you bought that at 7/11?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.750
Yeah. Well, I kind of did
with all the earnings

01:51.875 --> 01:54.114
that I'm making as Top Gun,
so think before you speak.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.155
- Eew.
- Ugh.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.924
Okay.

01:59.049 --> 02:00.692
Good morning, everyone.

02:00.817 --> 02:04.541
You're probably...

02:04.707 --> 02:06.698
Okay, you're probably
wondering why Jillian looks

02:06.823 --> 02:08.467
like an overgrown rug rat.

02:08.592 --> 02:09.795
How's it going?

02:09.961 --> 02:11.503
Well, my college gal pal Rachael

02:11.628 --> 02:13.405
is actually product manager

02:13.530 --> 02:15.886
for one of our favorite clients,
Fuzzy Onesies.

02:17.434 --> 02:18.477
And I thought it would be
a real treat

02:18.602 --> 02:19.744
to send her a staff photo

02:19.869 --> 02:23.685
of all of you guys wearing
her adult pajamas.

02:23.851 --> 02:25.187
- Oh, you go girl!

02:25.353 --> 02:27.319
Okay, so everyone has a pair
of pajamas at their desks

02:27.444 --> 02:28.987
so we'll just fit this in at lunch.

02:29.112 --> 02:29.988
- Okay.
- What?

02:30.113 --> 02:30.984
- Lunch?
- Lunch.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.057
No.

02:32.182 --> 02:33.528
But that's when I read magazines.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.906
When am I gonna have time
to read magazines?

02:36.072 --> 02:37.229
- Come on.
- God. Okay.

02:37.354 --> 02:40.198
You know what, we are
doing this...

02:40.323 --> 02:48.043
Because it's cute, it's fun,
and if you don't...Oh, God.

02:56.373 --> 02:57.636
I'm just gonna have to swallow that.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.763
Okay, you know what, I'm done.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.653
I can't take it.
I'm going home.

03:01.778 --> 03:04.556
If any of you have
any questions or concerns,

03:04.681 --> 03:07.025
Jillian is gonna be
my eyes and my ears

03:07.150 --> 03:08.360
for the rest of the day.

03:08.485 --> 03:10.857
So just let her know,
and she'll give me a call.

03:11.023 --> 03:12.609
Don't you fuck dare call me.

03:12.775 --> 03:13.944
All right.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.863
Wait, you're leaving her
in charge, not me?

03:17.029 --> 03:17.903
Okay, Anders.

03:18.028 --> 03:20.405
Just please worry about
yourself, please.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.439
Don't worry about anything.

03:21.564 --> 03:24.009
Go home and you rice, all right?

03:24.134 --> 03:28.041
That stands for rest,
ice, coffee, explosion.

03:28.207 --> 03:31.169
- Shut up, Jillian.
- All right.

03:31.335 --> 03:33.797
Alice, feel better.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.253
Take it sleazy.

03:37.341 --> 03:38.790
That's the thing I'm saying
now...Take it sleazy.

03:38.915 --> 03:40.303
I like it, yeah.

03:40.469 --> 03:42.764
As your newly appointed
leader, our first order...

03:42.930 --> 03:44.162
Wait guys, don't leave yet.

03:44.287 --> 03:46.565
No. Wait, we haven't figured
out the pajama thing.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.667
Waymond, you stay right there.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.835
Get that...No.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.607
No, no, no, no, no.

03:52.773 --> 03:53.905
That's a hat.

03:54.030 --> 03:56.174
Hey, guys, do you mind
getting back to your desk

03:56.299 --> 03:58.029
and make it a successful work day?

03:58.195 --> 03:59.077
Ooh!

03:59.202 --> 04:00.574
One more toss and that's it.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.881
Okay, maybe not a beer,
maybe paper work.

04:03.006 --> 04:04.549
Hey, Jet Set, oh.

04:04.674 --> 04:09.082
Uh, so I was thinking maybe we
should do the group photo soon.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.455
Suck my dick.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.501
Be gone.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.695
Hey, Blake, be honest.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.884
What is it about me
that no one respects?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.932
Is it my hair?

04:21.057 --> 04:23.401
Yeah. I'm thinking about
getting a new haircut,

04:23.526 --> 04:25.704
changing stuff up.

04:25.829 --> 04:28.340
Maybe getting like an...
Arnie Schwarzenegger,

04:28.465 --> 04:30.709
<i>Jingle All The Way</i> type of haircut?

04:30.834 --> 04:34.379
You know, short, tall and stiff.

04:34.504 --> 04:36.318
Kind of like how I like my men.

04:38.308 --> 04:39.184
Oh.

04:39.309 --> 04:41.156
Oh, I literally almost puked.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.824
That's right. Work parties.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.522
Kind of makes you wish Alice
was sick forever.

04:44.647 --> 04:46.958
Or that Jillian
was in charge as well also.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.260
Jillian's not in charge.

04:48.385 --> 04:49.527
If anybody should be in charge,

04:49.652 --> 04:51.062
it should be the Top Gun over here.

04:51.187 --> 04:52.864
I mean, why would she send me
to that leadership conference

04:52.989 --> 04:54.532
to see Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger speak?

04:54.657 --> 04:55.600
Well, she didn't send you.

04:55.725 --> 04:56.635
Right, but I went anyway.

04:56.760 --> 04:57.714
I showed initiative.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.939
I can't believe you are
such a dick hole

05:01.064 --> 05:03.675
and didn't invite me to see
Rudy, he's my hero;

05:03.800 --> 05:05.810
the way he carried Frodo
up that mountain.

05:05.935 --> 05:07.946
I didn't see Sean Astin, the actor.

05:08.071 --> 05:08.980
I saw Rudy.

05:09.105 --> 05:10.115
Like the real Rudy.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.850
He dead-lifted 350
right in front of us.

05:11.975 --> 05:14.119
Oh.

05:14.244 --> 05:15.106
I'm here.

05:15.272 --> 05:16.121
Getting that perp.

05:16.246 --> 05:17.222
Got that perp on.

05:17.347 --> 05:18.223
Howdy, guys.

05:18.348 --> 05:19.224
You smelt those burgers, huh?

05:19.349 --> 05:20.425
Yeah.

05:20.550 --> 05:21.826
I got a couple of toppings
for the burgers,

05:21.951 --> 05:22.894
raided some lunches.

05:23.019 --> 05:24.329
Dude, check this out.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.431
Waymond only eats gummy worms.

05:26.556 --> 05:27.732
All right.

05:27.857 --> 05:29.100
Anyways, I thought maybe
we could throw a couple

05:29.225 --> 05:30.769
on my burger,
do it ninja turtle style.

05:30.894 --> 05:32.137
Let's do it.

05:32.262 --> 05:33.438
- You're the best.
- Let's do it.

05:33.563 --> 05:34.439
Thanks.

05:34.564 --> 05:36.341
- Oh!
- Jeez.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.809
Babe, we can't hear you, babe.

05:37.934 --> 05:38.810
- We can't hear you.
- We can't hear you, though.

05:38.935 --> 05:39.811
What?

05:39.936 --> 05:40.879
We can't hear you.

05:41.004 --> 05:42.047
I couldn't hear you guys either.

05:42.172 --> 05:43.281
But what was I saying was

05:43.406 --> 05:45.050
I thought I could count
on you boys, but nope,

05:45.175 --> 05:46.284
you have to go fool me

05:46.409 --> 05:48.853
with the sex dummy
in the swivel chair routine.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.101
It takes a dummy to fool
a dummy, dummy!

05:51.267 --> 05:53.895
Well, at least I'm not pumping
a plastic bitch, you pervs.

05:54.061 --> 05:55.313
- Okay.
- Gross!

05:55.479 --> 05:56.261
She's not a bitch, she's a real doll.

05:56.386 --> 05:57.482
She's a real friend to me.

05:57.754 --> 05:59.150
I'm sorry, I didn't know
she was your friend.

05:59.316 --> 06:00.732
It's like...I thought I told
you to get rid of that thing.

06:00.857 --> 06:01.900
It's breeding ground for bacteria.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.168
Is it?

06:03.293 --> 06:05.865
Get off my back about it,
Ders, I washed her.

06:06.031 --> 06:08.740
You did.. like when... how many
days... did you... ago did wash it?

06:08.865 --> 06:09.808
Yeah, no.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.242
I just threw her in the dishwasher,

06:11.367 --> 06:12.811
put it on, like, the heavy pot
scrubbing mode.

06:12.936 --> 06:14.145
Okay. That's disgusting.

06:14.270 --> 06:15.847
I'm like itching already just
thinking about it.

06:15.972 --> 06:17.382
Ders, she's not a sex doll

06:17.507 --> 06:19.050
because none of us are
having sex with it.

06:19.336 --> 06:21.686
Sex is a pretty relative term,
like, what is sex, you know.

06:21.811 --> 06:23.121
Guys, can you please
set a good example

06:23.246 --> 06:24.843
and go back to work, please?

06:25.009 --> 06:26.224
I hate telling people what to do.

06:26.510 --> 06:28.693
It makes me anxious
and I get all sweaty

06:28.818 --> 06:30.428
and then I get all body conscious.

06:30.553 --> 06:33.098
How bad is it?
How bad is it?

06:33.223 --> 06:34.099
Scale of one to soaked.

06:34.224 --> 06:35.186
Not good.

06:35.352 --> 06:36.167
Guys, no.

06:36.292 --> 06:37.335
Not in the office.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.070
It's not classy. Hey!

06:39.356 --> 06:40.538
Get back...Okay.

06:40.663 --> 06:41.906
Who did that?

06:42.031 --> 06:43.695
Hillbillies.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.825
Well, well, well.

06:57.041 --> 06:57.889
All right.

06:58.014 --> 07:00.125
Listen up,
you minimum-waged lowlifes!

07:00.250 --> 07:03.161
Gather round to see the freak show.

07:03.286 --> 07:06.097
So Alice got an email from corporate

07:06.222 --> 07:09.267
that says that she's supposed
to fire four people this week

07:09.392 --> 07:10.568
due to their recent performance.

07:10.693 --> 07:11.569
What?

07:11.694 --> 07:12.474
That's right.

07:12.729 --> 07:14.773
Four of you are getting the chop.

07:14.898 --> 07:16.436
So if you wanna keep your jobs,

07:16.602 --> 07:18.563
you might wanna go
get on those pajamas.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.245
First of all, you can't just
be firing people, Jillian.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.246
You ain't even the boss.

07:21.371 --> 07:22.247
Uh-oh.

07:22.372 --> 07:23.248
Are you out of your mind?

07:23.373 --> 07:24.382
Where are you going?

07:24.507 --> 07:25.817
Where are you going, Jillian?

07:25.942 --> 07:28.119
Jillian, don't be closing
the door in my face, woman!

07:28.244 --> 07:29.421
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

07:29.546 --> 07:31.523
Oh, God.

07:31.648 --> 07:32.911
Oh, what have I done?

07:38.507 --> 07:39.383
- Come on.
- Oh, stop it!

07:39.508 --> 07:40.835
It's fine.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.295
I got everything under control.

07:42.461 --> 07:43.521
Really? Everything's under control?

07:43.646 --> 07:46.023
Jet Set's up here
shoving thumbs up butts.

07:46.148 --> 07:47.024
Jet Set, stop it!

07:47.149 --> 07:48.225
Let these papa smurfs in.

07:48.350 --> 07:50.011
We'll put some red pants
on this situation.

07:50.177 --> 07:51.930
Well, when you put it like that...

07:52.096 --> 07:53.164
Come on.

07:53.289 --> 07:54.165
Ow. Who did that?

07:54.290 --> 07:55.166
Help.

07:55.291 --> 07:56.267
- No.
- Ow.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.335
Careful.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.303
Excuse me, excuse me.

07:59.428 --> 08:00.571
Okay.

08:00.696 --> 08:01.839
- Stop, you monster.
- Hey!

08:01.964 --> 08:03.024
That was just violent for no reason.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.408
Okay.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.877
That was full penetration.
I feel... violated.

08:07.002 --> 08:08.379
I didn't know what happened, really.

08:08.504 --> 08:12.516
I just...I wanted them to respect
me and then they went crazy.

08:12.641 --> 08:15.419
And to make matters worse,
I can't find my uncrustables

08:15.544 --> 08:17.914
and my butthole is sweating
like it's getting paid to.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.375
Okay. All right.
Here's the deal.

08:20.683 --> 08:22.093
We need to go calm
the herd ASAP, right?

08:22.218 --> 08:23.394
How are we gonna do that?

08:23.519 --> 08:24.962
We're gonna go tell
the people that are fired

08:25.087 --> 08:25.880
that they're fired.

08:26.046 --> 08:27.164
Donald Trump these fools.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.733
You're terminated!

08:28.858 --> 08:31.268
Once they hear that news,
everybody will relax,

08:31.393 --> 08:33.203
they'll go back to work,
we'll be good to glow.

08:33.328 --> 08:35.339
People are gonna hate me
if I fire them.

08:35.464 --> 08:36.340
It'sot that hard.

08:36.465 --> 08:37.541
I mean give me the list,

08:37.666 --> 08:39.076
and I'll Schindler
those fools right now.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.412
Nah. I don't think you
want to say that, actually.

08:41.537 --> 08:43.188
That so inappropriate.

08:43.355 --> 08:44.615
I never saw the movie.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.616
It's a tearjerker.

08:45.741 --> 08:48.111
Morgan Freeman, Jack Nicholson.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.687
They have a whole list
that they need to Schindler

08:49.812 --> 08:50.864
- before they die.
- Yes. Right.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.590
That's <i>Bucket List.</i>

08:52.715 --> 08:55.259
Okay, guys, corporate hasn't
even sent me the names yet.

08:55.384 --> 08:56.627
And besides that,

08:56.752 --> 08:59.063
I've been fired from
a lot of jobs before...

08:59.188 --> 09:00.331
All right. You know what?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.700
This is why I should've been
left in charge

09:02.825 --> 09:04.668
'cause all the stuff out there
wouldn't be happening right now

09:04.793 --> 09:05.587
'cause I'm a born leader.

09:05.861 --> 09:06.871
All right?

09:06.996 --> 09:07.872
I'd be out there commanding people,

09:07.997 --> 09:09.440
they'd be listening to me

09:09.565 --> 09:11.634
and they'd be doing everything
I want them to do.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.094
What's the problem with your face?

09:13.260 --> 09:15.146
It's the onesie.
It's giving me hives.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.098
It's like this
synthetic wool or something.

09:17.264 --> 09:20.393
Jillian, I think this is
gonna be good for you.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.454
Yeah, we might have
a major breakthrough.

09:23.579 --> 09:25.556
Damn! You are just like
really sweating.

09:25.681 --> 09:27.091
Ooh.

09:27.216 --> 09:28.651
- You're armpits are unreal.
- Are they...They got worse?

09:28.817 --> 09:29.960
They might be.

09:30.085 --> 09:31.061
How about we get her some fresh air.

09:31.186 --> 09:32.129
All right, we just got to figure out

09:32.254 --> 09:33.264
how to get past these psychos.

09:33.389 --> 09:35.366
All right.
Let's go. Let's go.

09:37.026 --> 09:38.035
Oh, you're getting laid
with that thing.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.704
Get back! Let's just go.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.905
Don't wanna have sex you.

09:41.030 --> 09:41.956
Yes. You do.

09:42.122 --> 09:43.500
'Cause you're nasty.

09:43.799 --> 09:48.679
Okay, sweetie, I want you
to just smile, be calm,

09:48.804 --> 09:49.672
and just say it.

09:49.838 --> 09:51.882
Be a cold-blooded robot, Jillian.

09:52.007 --> 09:53.218
No fear.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.786
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you're...

09:55.911 --> 09:56.763
Say it!

09:56.929 --> 09:58.255
I can't. Her face is too sad.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.423
Come on.

09:59.548 --> 10:00.516
It's just... it's a real doll.

10:00.682 --> 10:03.061
It's Blake's friend.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.295
Do you realize that the United States

10:04.420 --> 10:05.563
is on life support right now?

10:05.788 --> 10:07.832
Watch your mou, bro.

10:07.957 --> 10:10.568
My dad says that international
economic competition

10:10.693 --> 10:12.002
is heating up because
the United States

10:12.127 --> 10:14.071
is getting too fat and too lazy.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.341
My dad says we think we deserve jobs.

10:17.466 --> 10:18.451
My dad says we don't.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.244
Does your dad ever fire people?

10:20.369 --> 10:24.048
My dad has fired over 200
people this fiscal year alone.

10:24.173 --> 10:25.282
You wanna know why?

10:25.407 --> 10:28.670
Because he's trying
to save this country.

10:28.836 --> 10:29.687
Are you crying right now?

10:29.812 --> 10:30.754
No, I'm not crying.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.022
Are you all right?

10:32.147 --> 10:33.190
It's the onesie.
It's burning my eyes.

10:33.315 --> 10:34.191
Stop!

10:34.316 --> 10:35.468
Wanna hug?

10:35.684 --> 10:36.594
I'm going to flush
my eyes out.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.720
Deal with this.

10:37.886 --> 10:39.013
Okay. I got an idea.

10:39.179 --> 10:40.364
What of we do like
a little scrimmage?

10:40.489 --> 10:42.016
Adam, you be the firee...

10:42.182 --> 10:44.268
That doesn't make much sense,
kinda the Top Gun.

10:44.643 --> 10:46.604
And I will be the firer, okay.

10:46.829 --> 10:49.673
And no matter what this guy says
or throws my way, you know,

10:49.798 --> 10:52.910
I'll just power through
and I'll fire the guy, okay?

10:53.035 --> 10:54.345
It's real easy.
Are you ready?

10:54.470 --> 10:56.814
- I'm ready.
- Okay. Let's get to it.

10:56.939 --> 11:02.495
Adam, I'm sorry to say this,
but we got to let you go, bud.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.333
You're firing me?

11:07.499 --> 11:12.029
I work here for 60 years
building this company

11:12.154 --> 11:15.592
from the ground up,
and you firing me?

11:15.758 --> 11:16.718
Sorry, dude.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.430
I ain't going out
like no bitch, you bitch.

11:21.296 --> 11:22.598
Anders, you heard anything?

11:22.764 --> 11:24.976
I can't lose my job, you understand?

11:25.142 --> 11:26.686
I ain't going back
to substitute teaching.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.812
Montez, my eyes
are burning right now.

11:28.937 --> 11:29.880
Come on.

11:30.005 --> 11:32.567
You kids got no shame, no decency.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.485
Thanks for this apron, man.

11:34.651 --> 11:38.072
You got a .44 magnum
pointed at your head.

11:38.238 --> 11:40.658
What the fuck are you doing?

11:40.824 --> 11:45.538
You fire me, I'll kill you
and everybody in here.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.582
Oh, do what he says, Blake.

11:48.415 --> 11:50.043
You really think I'm that stupid?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.961
What are you talking about?

11:52.127 --> 11:54.672
Check the gun, hotshot.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.009
Very clever.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.803
Very clever.

12:00.969 --> 12:03.014
You take the bullets out of my gun.

12:03.180 --> 12:03.890
Yeah.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.584
But let's see if you can
take the bullets

12:06.709 --> 12:09.020
out of this butterfly knife.

12:14.107 --> 12:16.653
Jillian, go ahead and give
this guy a cigarette,

12:16.819 --> 12:18.653
'cause I'm about to light him up.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.116
Are those sunglasses?

12:22.282 --> 12:24.902
- Yeah, sunglasses.
- Cool.

12:25.027 --> 12:26.621
For my flamethrower.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.706
No, no.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.418
- You're fired.
- No!

12:33.068 --> 12:34.011
You're so fired.

12:41.301 --> 12:44.180
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

12:49.618 --> 12:50.728
And he's fired.

12:50.894 --> 12:52.230
- And I'm fired.
- And he's fired.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.331
- That was very informative.
- Thank you.

12:54.456 --> 12:55.817
And a wonderful performance.

12:57.092 --> 12:58.194
All the names came in.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.303
Oh, here we go, baby.

12:59.428 --> 13:00.404
Who's gettin' chopped?

13:00.529 --> 13:01.505
Jillian-style.

13:01.630 --> 13:03.507
Okay. Clint.

13:03.632 --> 13:04.492
- Uh-hmm, yes.
- Yeah.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.210
- Garth.
- That makes sense.

13:06.335 --> 13:07.161
Lois.

13:07.327 --> 13:08.212
Oh, the big stink.

13:08.337 --> 13:09.163
Oh.

13:09.329 --> 13:11.124
- And Adam.
- Hmm?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.291
Who?

13:12.508 --> 13:14.127
Demamp. Oh.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.185
I'm...I'm confused.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.254
Wait, I'm fired?

13:16.420 --> 13:17.287
No.

13:17.412 --> 13:18.297
Good.

13:18.463 --> 13:21.425
You're going to be fired.

13:21.550 --> 13:26.097
Fuck!

13:26.263 --> 13:28.683
♪ You gotta, you gotta be fresh ♪

13:31.977 --> 13:35.922
Fuck!

13:36.047 --> 13:36.983
Me!

13:39.610 --> 13:41.612
Jillian, how many times
have I saved your life, hmm?

13:41.778 --> 13:42.662
I don't know... six?

13:42.787 --> 13:44.073
Never!

13:44.289 --> 13:46.600
And in never will now because
I thought we were work friends

13:46.725 --> 13:48.235
and then you fire me.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.470
And then you fire me
like a cold-blooded robot.

13:50.595 --> 13:51.914
You're like, "yeah, you're fired!"

13:52.080 --> 13:53.840
I was just doing
what you told me to do.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.243
Since when have you listened to me?

13:56.368 --> 13:57.410
I just talk.

13:57.535 --> 13:58.778
I just talk to hear myself think.

13:58.903 --> 14:00.006
Nobody actually listens to me.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.122
Hey, you know,
I'm just here talking and...

14:04.756 --> 14:07.638
Why the fuck are there
no Reese's pieces?

14:07.804 --> 14:08.639
Okay, Adam...

14:08.805 --> 14:09.856
You suck Reese's pieces.

14:09.981 --> 14:11.124
Hey, you are stress-eating.

14:11.249 --> 14:12.259
Gimme the chips.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.686
Plain potato chips, really?

14:13.952 --> 14:15.161
You can have one more.

14:15.286 --> 14:17.664
Now were closing this.

14:17.789 --> 14:18.665
Unreal.

14:18.790 --> 14:19.866
Come on.

14:19.991 --> 14:21.902
I'm sure this is all
just a big mistake.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.069
Let's just relax.

14:23.194 --> 14:25.239
Let's calm our jets.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.907
My jets are calm.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.176
Besides, Alice is the only one
that can fire me.

14:30.301 --> 14:31.621
So I'm not going anywhere

14:31.787 --> 14:36.904
until I hear it come
from her sweet, pursed lips.

14:38.176 --> 14:38.961
Okay.

14:39.362 --> 14:41.923
This is exactly what I didn't
want to happen.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.090
I'm wearing a Top Gun hat,
for God sakes.

14:44.257 --> 14:47.093
If I get fired today,
I'm gonna look like an idiot.

14:47.218 --> 14:48.595
And this hat's bad ass.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.796
It is. I love it.

14:49.921 --> 14:51.265
You should fire some other dummy.

14:51.431 --> 14:53.226
- Oh.
- Wait.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.143
Did you just...

14:54.426 --> 14:55.436
I have to go to rest room.

14:55.602 --> 14:56.403
I have an idea.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.480
Oh.

14:58.496 --> 15:00.507
Uh... oh, yes.

15:00.632 --> 15:01.400
Great.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.642
Oh, got it.

15:05.770 --> 15:07.047
Who's there?

15:07.172 --> 15:08.157
Hello.

15:08.373 --> 15:09.883
Is someone there?

15:10.008 --> 15:11.885
Listen, I'm armed and I've got
aids, so it's not worth it.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.086
What?

15:13.211 --> 15:15.155
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

15:15.280 --> 15:16.123
Oh, Allison.

15:16.381 --> 15:18.391
Hey, listen, these... these onesies.

15:18.516 --> 15:19.392
They're making me break out.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.127
I can't really see anything.

15:21.252 --> 15:22.195
I got to go to the hospital.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.756
See, I just got a call from Montez.

15:23.922 --> 15:26.399
Says that Jillian is going
around firing people.

15:26.524 --> 15:28.134
Well, yeah. She is.

15:28.259 --> 15:29.402
And you know what?

15:29.527 --> 15:31.938
Rudy says, "when you leave
the third string kicker

15:32.063 --> 15:35.275
in the quarterback's position,
someone's gonna get sacked."

15:35.400 --> 15:36.977
Okay. Just shut up and follow me.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.545
I want to know what's going on.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.313
Okay. Would you take
my hand actually?

15:40.438 --> 15:41.448
Hey, Alice, hold up.

15:41.573 --> 15:42.449
What?

15:42.574 --> 15:43.617
One thing right quick.

15:43.742 --> 15:44.718
What's up?

15:44.843 --> 15:47.446
Adam, get down from there right now.

15:47.612 --> 15:49.322
I don't have to listen
to anything you have to say

15:49.447 --> 15:50.690
for the rest of my life,

15:50.815 --> 15:53.828
which is about to end
because you fired me, Alice.

15:53.994 --> 15:58.465
So hear me, world, 'cause
these are my last words.

15:58.590 --> 16:02.202
If you take anything from Adam
"The Top Gun" Demamp's life,

16:02.327 --> 16:03.588
take this.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.545
Take it sleazy.

16:06.614 --> 16:07.974
And I'm out.

16:08.099 --> 16:09.476
Write that down.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.944
"Take it sleazy and I'm out"
are my last words.

16:11.069 --> 16:12.112
And I'm killing myself.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.481
What the hell does
any of that even mean?

16:14.606 --> 16:15.715
Take it sleazy!

16:16.850 --> 16:19.386
Oh, no!

16:19.511 --> 16:22.656
Oh, Adam! Oh, no!

16:22.781 --> 16:25.692
Why would he... this is your fault!

16:25.817 --> 16:27.394
You should've put me in charge.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.574
Hey. It's a dummy, you blind idiot.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.600
Wait, what?

16:33.725 --> 16:35.995
What you have seen here
was not real.

16:36.161 --> 16:40.674
This was a demonstration of what
strange turns life can take

16:40.799 --> 16:42.842
when the powers that be make
dumb decisions...

16:42.967 --> 16:43.843
... Stupid

16:43.968 --> 16:45.779
decisions.
Dumb decision?

16:45.904 --> 16:46.964
- Stupid decisions.
- Stupid decisions.

16:47.130 --> 16:51.969
So put your fears aside,
for Adam is alive.

16:53.629 --> 16:55.181
Hey.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.517
I just...I just wanted them to
listen to me so I told them

16:58.683 --> 17:00.019
about the terminations.

17:00.485 --> 17:03.463
I get those emails
all the time from corporate

17:03.588 --> 17:05.131
when they're trying to trim the fat

17:05.256 --> 17:08.444
and everyone has been
on that list, even you.

17:08.856 --> 17:11.371
But you know what?
I never follow through with it.

17:11.496 --> 17:12.372
Do you wanna know why?

17:12.656 --> 17:13.473
Yeah, I wanna know why.

17:13.740 --> 17:15.909
Because emails don't run this office.

17:16.034 --> 17:16.993
I do.

17:17.635 --> 17:20.039
You're the best in the biz

Ya don't do that.

That's kind of a law that exists
here on earth with us humans.

17:30.448 --> 17:32.426
So I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to clean out your desk.

17:32.592 --> 17:34.027
What?

17:34.152 --> 17:36.494
I'm fired because
of some stupid earth law?

Ow.

Jillian can't be fired.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.278
That's like egregious or something.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.813
That's an American word, right?

17:52.938 --> 17:53.814
Egregious.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.015
I don't know, actually.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.909
I just think it might be
German. Egregious.

It's like we're losing
one of the team here, man.

18:00.203 --> 18:03.324
I know, she's like
our air bud, golden receiver.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.026
I was thinking more of our Rudy.

Hey, Alice.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.599
I guess this is it.

I got all my stuff, so.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.068
Okay.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.262
Well, I'm sorry
it had to end this way.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.445
No. No.

Okay, look she is fired, okay?

There is nothing you can say
or do about it.

Please don't do any more stuff.

18:32.344 --> 18:35.906
Alice, we know Jillian suffers
from a ton of quirks,

18:36.148 --> 18:37.358
but this is the U.S.A.

18:37.657 --> 18:41.061
"Characters welcome"
is our country's motto.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.997
Yes, she's a horrible leader.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.298
Yeah.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.291
She's the worst we've all ever seen.

18:45.557 --> 18:46.500
Horrible.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.002
You should've left me in charge.

That said, she means a whole
heck of a lot to this company.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.408
So if you fire her, you fire us.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.443
Okay, you know what, Anders,
you're supposed to be

18:56.568 --> 18:57.911
the responsible one here.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.546
Okay, why don't you act like it?

18:59.671 --> 19:01.973
I believe that I am.
