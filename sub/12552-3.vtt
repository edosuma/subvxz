about them, of course.

-I was thinking,

what they want us
to think because...

-Rani...
-It could have been a

out this morning.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.288

-I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?

ignoring me?

we said we'd stay friends.

and Sarah Jane Smith
and the aliens.

that was a secret.

anyone, have you?

08:09.789 --> 08:11.057

with that kind of stuff,
so deal with it.

out there?

23:42.621 --> 23:43.989
They're just messing about.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.124
They didn't seem
to be having much fun.

23:46.191 --> 23:47.526
Look, I haven't
seen this girl.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.761
I mean, why would
she come here anyway?

23:49.828 --> 23:52.831
Rani's interested in
the history of Danemouth.

23:52.898 --> 23:55.400
Yeah. Cause she's...

23:55.467 --> 23:56.768
I don't even know
what that is.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.570
It's not like she'd find
anything, anyway.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.939
You know what she's like.
She's stupid.

24:01.973 --> 24:03.875
Oi. That's rather rude,
young man.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.312
You've never met her, mate.
She's thick and stupid.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.981
That's a horrible thing
to say about your friend.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.651
-True, though.
-Well, I thought
she seemed all...

24:12.717 --> 24:13.785
Gotcha!

24:16.888 --> 24:17.989
She's safe.

24:19.457 --> 24:20.859
You've got to believe me.

24:23.495 --> 24:26.832
Eve, you have to
let those people go,

24:26.898 --> 24:28.767
and then I can
help you get home.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.635
But you won't tell
your mum about me.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.871
-What?
-You find it so difficult.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.841
GCSEs and Judoon.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.876
Your parents,
and Sarah Jane Smith.

24:39.678 --> 24:41.646
Sometimes it's hard, yeah.

24:41.713 --> 24:44.716
Trying to do it all.
Having to keep
this sort of thing secret.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.596
-What are you doing?
-I told you,

24:57.662 --> 24:59.764
I'm sensitive to time.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.867
I can see your past.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.402
Sometimes you feel left out.

25:04.469 --> 25:07.505
It was lightning. Mr Smith
checked it out this morning.

25:07.572 --> 25:09.708
Maria's been helping aliens
hide from the government.

25:09.774 --> 25:11.810
She's the new Sarah Jane!

25:11.877 --> 25:12.811
(ALL LAUGHING)

25:14.246 --> 25:16.748
It's not like that.
Not really.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.583
It's okay,

25:18.650 --> 25:20.986
I can see how it could
have made you feel.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.654
I can see how it would
have hurt you.

25:22.854 --> 25:26.091
It was a one-off.
I overreacted.

25:26.157 --> 25:27.926
Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde

25:27.993 --> 25:30.962
have been trying
to contact you, but you
want to punish them.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.231
You need them, Rani.
You're lost without them.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.299
I'm not.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.967
I don't need them.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.736
(PHONE RINGS)

25:40.472 --> 25:41.907
I wish they'd just
leave me alone.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.581
Where is she, Harry?

25:49.648 --> 25:51.449
-I... I can't say.
-Fine.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.051
I'll just call the police.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.687
<i>Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

25:55.754 --> 25:59.591
-What is that?
<i>-Harry, bring her to me.</i>

26:02.661 --> 26:03.995
What is that?

26:07.666 --> 26:12.404
-CLYDE: Sarah Jane?
<i>-I wish to know who</i>
<i>Sarah Jane Smith is.</i>

26:12.470 --> 26:15.473
<i>And I wish to know</i>
<i>who Luke Smith is.</i>

26:15.540 --> 26:16.808
Do you want to see
your future?

26:16.875 --> 26:19.277
-I don't think we should.
-Why?

26:19.344 --> 26:20.712
What harm can it do?

26:20.779 --> 26:23.682
But... It's wrong.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.550
Is that what
Sarah Jane tells you?

26:26.851 --> 26:28.520
Let's do it.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.155
Are you sure you want to see?

26:30.221 --> 26:31.957
It'll make everything clearer.

26:32.023 --> 26:32.924
Do it!

26:37.195 --> 26:39.331
<i>See your future.</i>

26:39.397 --> 26:41.299
I can see it!

26:41.366 --> 26:46.571
My name is Rani...
Rani Chandra.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.207
Oh, God, make it stop!

26:49.274 --> 26:52.677
Please! No.
I can't become that!

26:52.744 --> 26:55.747
I'm so lost, so alone...

26:55.814 --> 26:58.416
The mad old woman
of Bannerman Road!

26:59.317 --> 27:01.786
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

27:05.557 --> 27:07.726
<i>The things she's seen...</i>

27:07.792 --> 27:09.461
MAN: How's my little darling?

27:11.930 --> 27:15.400
WOMAN: <i>He is returning.</i>
<i>He is coming back.</i>

27:15.467 --> 27:17.936
<i>We need the darkness,</i>
<i>it is our future.</i>

27:21.606 --> 27:22.874
<i>She must stop playing.</i>

27:24.542 --> 27:25.877
<i>-She will die.</i>
-Rani!
