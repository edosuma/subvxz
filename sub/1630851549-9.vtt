WEBVTT

00:20.281 --> 00:23.284
Top shelf, red container.

00:23.806 --> 00:27.766
You don't need to tell me
how good my leftovers are.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.420
Actually, I left a wallet
here someplace,

00:29.942 --> 00:30.682
but since you're offering...

00:31.031 --> 00:33.381
What the hell?

00:33.424 --> 00:35.557
Oh, whoa. Hey!

00:35.861 --> 00:37.211
Whoa! Hey.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.178
Pop... I didn't leave that burner on.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.224
What the hell, Pop?
- Were you cooking something?
- A couple of eggs.

00:50.746 --> 00:51.442
You could have burned
the whole house down

00:51.747 --> 00:52.704
if I wasn't here.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.054
Like I wouldn't hear
that damn alarm?

00:54.402 --> 00:55.751
Look, look, everything
is okay, okay?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.666
It was just a little hiccup.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.320
So get your leftovers,

00:59.842 --> 01:02.062
and Eddie's wallet is
- over there on the table.
- Hey, Pop...

01:02.410 --> 01:03.846
And we'll keep this
between us.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.543
Even from Dad?
He lives here, too.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.937
That wasn't a question.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.944
Kinda surprised
the boss paired us.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.293
I thought you were
with Badillo these days.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.208
Uh, yeah.
He banged in sick today.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.863
- Thank God.
- Butting heads already?

01:21.168 --> 01:24.301
Just growing pains.

01:26.738 --> 01:27.913
Oh, and now I'm boring you.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.438
No, no, I recently
gave up coffee.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.702
Those words make
no sense to me.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.878
It was making me feel barfy.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.141
And I can't stand
the smell of it anymore.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.230
Of course, without it,
- I'm always tired.
- Wait.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.102
Are you sure that's just
'cause of coffee?

01:42.406 --> 01:45.105
Of course it is.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.110
What the hell?

01:51.023 --> 01:52.199
Police! Don't move!

01:52.503 --> 01:54.462
- Drop the weapon.
- We have shots fired

01:54.984 --> 01:55.767
- at 394 10th Ave.
- Turn around.
Turn around right now

01:56.116 --> 01:58.640
and drop the weapon.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.991
I said drop the weapon!

02:12.784 --> 02:14.308
I'm good, keep going.
Stay with him.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.835
Cora!

02:25.928 --> 02:26.972
2-9 David.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.800
We have a 10-13, officer down.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.150
Send a bus forthwith!

02:35.242 --> 02:38.070
Everyone can see
what you're doing.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.464
I'm sitting here
enjoying my drink.

02:40.812 --> 02:41.596
And avoiding the other kids.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.163
I circulated.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.773
Half a lap around the room
- when we got here.
- Oh, come on.

02:45.077 --> 02:45.991
Everybody's got notes.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.297
I get enough notes
at the office.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.299
The whole city's your office.
You know that.

02:49.821 --> 02:53.216
Good news is I think
she's got a note for you.

02:59.266 --> 03:02.965
That is a commander with the
City of London Police.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.272
So all you top cops
really do know each other?

03:05.576 --> 03:08.362
We did some business
a while back.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.886
Sloane. Great to see you.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.888
Commissioner Reagan.
What a wonderful surprise.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.846
My deputy Garrett Moore.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.198
- A pleasure.
- Mine. I'm gonna go reload.

03:18.546 --> 03:21.070
So, what brings you
to New York?

03:21.375 --> 03:24.204
Business.
Since last March, actually.

03:25.466 --> 03:29.034
Oh. You guys open a shop here
I don't know about?

03:29.383 --> 03:33.125
I'm no longer Commander
Thompson, just Sloane.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.998
And, um, I'm working here
in a private sector job.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.740
What happened to
"I'm a cop till I drop"?

03:39.044 --> 03:40.785
Things change.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.961
Yeah, that's the saying.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.095
The other saying is
some things never change.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.185
And there was no
changing it back.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.320
- Really?
- So sorry.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.323
- You'll have to excuse us.
- Sorry.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.544
Our systems are
under cyberattack.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.720
Everything's down.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.375
- A hundred.
- More. Higher.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.246
Two hundred?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.422
No, 520 miles of coastline.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.642
That's more than Miami,
San Francisco,

04:11.947 --> 04:13.470
Boston, L.A. all combined.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.647
Wow, look at you dropping
the five borough knowledge.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.258
Native New Yorker.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.781
No, you just watch
- a lot of YouTube.
- That's true.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.391
Hey, are you two police?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.480
Yes, ma'am.
What's wrong?

04:24.002 --> 04:25.613
Some creep back there
is harassing me.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.136
Define harassing.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.094
Following me,
trying to talk to me,

04:29.443 --> 04:30.574
even after I told him
to get lost.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.185
That's him.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.623
Step over here.
Excuse me, sir?

04:36.145 --> 04:38.365
Excuse me, police.
- Can I have a word?
- Me?

04:38.408 --> 04:40.584
Yeah, you.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.631
Do you have an ID?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.895
Did I do something wrong?

04:47.199 --> 04:47.983
Besides harassing
women at night?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.811
I didn't do anything
to anybody.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.421
I thought they repealed
stop-and-frisks.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.597
So you're a lawyer
and a creep, is that it?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.599
No, I'm a tax accountant.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.995
His ID isn't registering
in Precinct Connect.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.606
Let me try.

05:02.650 --> 05:03.738
Is this fake?
No.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.653
It's not a fake ID, sir.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.003
You mind telling me
- what this is all about?
- PCS is down on mine, too.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.439
- Call it in.
- Yeah.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.006
How long is this gonna take?
I have a dinner to go to.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.486
It won't be long.
Just a minute.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.096
Keep your hands out of
your pockets, please, sir.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.228
Sir, is this cop
- harassing you?
- Yeah.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.970
I think because of
this lady here.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.320
Officer, you need to stop this.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.670
And you and you need
to mind your business.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.976
The system's down citywide.
Every precinct.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.978
No one's getting access
to anything.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.458
- That can't be.
- This is not okay.

05:28.980 --> 05:29.633
- Relax.
- Police cannot detain people

05:29.677 --> 05:31.200
without a reason.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.768
- You know what, forget it.
- What are you talking about?

05:34.072 --> 05:34.725
I'm not gonna become
the next "Karen"

05:35.030 --> 05:37.293
with all these phones out.

05:37.598 --> 05:40.296
Well, did he harass you
or not? Great.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.038
Reagan, you really want to
lose your pension over this?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.692
I'd like your names
and badge numbers, please.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.171
Everyone record this,

05:46.476 --> 05:47.956
so the world knows
- who these two are.
Yeah!

05:48.260 --> 05:50.045
You have a good evening.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.919
Okay, good night, Gavin Powers.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.661
Goodbye. Good night, everyone.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.663
Enjoy your videos.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.535
Goodbye.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.739
Hey.
Janko.

06:31.782 --> 06:32.740
How are you feeling?

06:32.783 --> 06:34.176
Ooh, oh.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.570
After that nap, great.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.789
You scared the hell
out of me.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.095
Oh, relax.
No concussion.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.792
Vest stopped the bullet.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.533
Nothing more than
a bruised rib.

06:44.055 --> 06:44.795
Best news, I heard
over the radio

06:44.839 --> 06:46.754
the shooter was collared.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.234
And your baby's okay, too?

06:51.106 --> 06:52.020
Come on, Cora.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.283
The symptoms you were
describing--

06:54.588 --> 06:57.982
nausea, feeling tired,
things smelling bad--

06:58.287 --> 06:59.027
I know it's none
of my business...

06:59.331 --> 07:00.376
You can say that again.

07:00.681 --> 07:02.596
But you are pregnant, right?

07:05.729 --> 07:07.688
Please just tell me
that baby's okay.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.344
Yeah, she is.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.694
Thank God for Kevlar.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.000
That's good.
That's good.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.654
But you cannot tell anyone.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.309
If the doctor knows,
it's gonna go in the report.

07:20.614 --> 07:21.745
I mean that I knew
before now.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.094
But you did know before.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.269
And you didn't alert
the department

07:24.618 --> 07:25.793
and go on desk duty.

07:26.097 --> 07:26.881
I know the rules, Eddie.

07:27.185 --> 07:27.925
Why not follow them?

07:28.230 --> 07:29.449
The pay is the same.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.842
Because if the powers that be
know I'm pregnant,

07:32.147 --> 07:33.714
there goes my DB interview.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.281
Oh, you're bucking
for detective.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.935
You don't think
I'm good enough.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.633
Of course I do.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.635
Cora, everyone knows
you're on the ball.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.811
But the department
can't ding a woman

07:43.854 --> 07:45.856
who wants to start a family.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.205
For a civil servant spot, no.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.686
But for a merit promotion
like detective,

07:50.208 --> 07:52.254
what have you
done for me lately?

07:53.821 --> 07:55.257
Yeah, okay.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.739
The baby's dad skipped
the moment I told him.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.786
So I gotta get the gold shield
and the raise that comes with it

08:03.134 --> 08:04.614
to be able to support us.

08:05.136 --> 08:08.749
Look, I'm not gonna
volunteer anything,

08:08.792 --> 08:09.706
but if someone asks...

08:10.228 --> 08:12.448
- You gotta have my back.
- Cora...

08:12.753 --> 08:15.973
Look, I know I risked her life,

08:16.278 --> 08:18.149
but I need you to
do this for me.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.674
For her.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.240
Please?

08:22.545 --> 08:23.459
I'm begging you,

08:23.764 --> 08:26.157
do not tell a soul.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.945
What worm are you trying
to catch so early?

08:31.249 --> 08:33.948
The PCS is back up citywide.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.516
- I heard. What a cluster.
- Even worse,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.474
Gavin Powers, the guy
we let go last night...

08:38.779 --> 08:40.781
Only after you made me.

08:40.824 --> 08:41.651
...has a bench warrant out

08:42.217 --> 08:44.132
for an assault charge
in Penylvania.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.177
- You see, my gut was right.
- Forget your gut.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.572
My ears are being talked off
by the brass of Philly PD.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.400
Were they
applauding us for our

08:51.705 --> 08:54.316
careful handling of a very
difficult situation?

08:54.621 --> 08:56.710
No, they want to yell because
you let the suspect go,

08:56.753 --> 08:57.928
thanks to Baez.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.888
I reached out to Philly PD
to verify Powers' identity.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.063
Yeah, it wasn't our fault, boss.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.413
Tell it to the detective
that's working Powers' case.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.937
She's coming up
I-95 right now

09:07.242 --> 09:08.548
to have a little chat with you.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.506
Why does "little chat"
sound so menacing?

09:10.811 --> 09:13.248
Look, use my office,
and when she's done with you,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.598
it's my turn.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.908
And thank you all.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.693
To be continued.

09:24.694 --> 09:27.479
Sixty-two minutes.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.351
Our guys foiled the attack

09:29.656 --> 09:31.135
and got us back up
and running

09:31.440 --> 09:32.484
in only 62 minutes.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.399
A lot can go wrong
in 62 minutes, Sid.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.271
I thought you'd be happy
- about it.
- About what?

09:36.793 --> 09:39.404
A gridlocked system that ate our
critical response capabilities?

09:39.753 --> 09:40.884
911 alone going down

09:41.406 --> 09:44.758
contributed to a dozen
fatalities and counting.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.108
Yeah, I know. I'm sick
about that, boss.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.415
But our guys' savvy did save us
a $10 million ransom.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.026
But paid it back out

09:52.330 --> 09:54.115
in credibility costs.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.858
"Serve and Protect Can't Protect
Their Own Servers."

09:57.901 --> 10:00.687
"Cop Crash Costs Lives."

10:00.730 --> 10:02.906
"NYPD-leted."

10:03.428 --> 10:04.821
They never got nothing
good to say.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.955
And today they're right.

10:08.477 --> 10:12.916
Sir, Commander Thompson of the
City of London Police is here.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.401
Not a good time.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.926
She said it's regarding
last night's attack.

10:26.364 --> 10:29.716
Okay, let's have her.
And you join us.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.940
Sloane. Please sit down.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.551
I don't think you've met
Lieutenant Gormley.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.642
- Nice to meet you.
- Good morning.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.909
So... what about the attack
last night?

10:49.431 --> 10:51.955
Yes, uh, we didn't finish
catching up yesterday.

10:52.477 --> 10:55.655
I'm in New York
as VP North America

10:55.959 --> 10:58.048
for Aegis & Associates.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.528
Cybersecurity.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.052
Mm-hmm. The best.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.578
- We like ours.
- As well you should.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.016
It appears they've
done a great job

11:09.059 --> 11:10.844
in limiting the damage.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.716
Thank you.
But do you know
for certain

11:14.021 --> 11:16.676
that your people
contained the intrusion,

11:16.980 --> 11:19.330
or that the attackers had
already timed their retreat?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.811
To what end?

11:23.987 --> 11:25.685
We're seeing an uptick
in attacks

11:25.989 --> 11:28.600
that seem full-on,
but are really just a way

11:28.905 --> 11:30.515
of testing the targeted systems

11:30.820 --> 11:31.603
by stressing them.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.695
And that $10 million ransom...

11:35.999 --> 11:37.522
Which we didn't have to pay.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.263
That's what you call
lunch money.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.223
You see, I would seriously
consider that your enemies

11:42.527 --> 11:44.007
are playing a longer game here.

11:44.529 --> 11:45.922
They already know
your system's strengths,

11:46.444 --> 11:48.969
which usually reveal
the weaknesses as well.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.493
Nothing's perfect.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.975
Cops don't like coincidence.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.368
As a former cop, I know
you understand that.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.153
I do.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.546
Us being attacked last night,
and you suddenly showing up

12:01.851 --> 12:04.506
pitching solutions, well,

12:04.811 --> 12:07.248
it causes one to wonder.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.598
If they're somehow connected?

12:09.903 --> 12:11.774
I have to ask, Sloane.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.950
I neither had nor have
any knowledge

12:14.472 --> 12:16.736
of the attack last night,
but I do have eons

12:17.084 --> 12:18.868
of experience in this area.

12:19.390 --> 12:22.742
And I have come today
as a friend of the court.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.876
And this friend would do what?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.139
Ask for the autopsy.
See if I can help.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.404
With a contract for your firm?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.233
If it's appropriate.

12:36.538 --> 12:39.715
If not, then gratis.

12:42.152 --> 12:45.895
Thank you so much for your time,
Commissioner Reagan.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.159
Let me know if I can be
of assistance.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.162
Good morning, everyone.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.084
I don't remember her
quite so...

13:01.128 --> 13:02.259
Ballsy?

13:02.564 --> 13:03.870
Intense?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.445
And that's when you let
a known felon

13:14.750 --> 13:17.100
with an active felony warrant
walk free?

13:17.622 --> 13:20.974
He wasn't known to us.
NYPD's system was down.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.193
Maybe you heard it on the radio
on your way here?

13:23.715 --> 13:25.326
If sarcasm's all you got,
no wonder you let him get away.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.632
Detective, we had no choice.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.330
Just like Powers'
six victims.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.201
Six victims?

13:31.506 --> 13:32.942
One confirmed felony assault,

13:33.464 --> 13:35.640
but I suspect him on five more.
All middle-age women.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.207
All the same act.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.687
Six?

13:38.992 --> 13:42.038
Let me guess, it
involves their dogs.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.693
Powers sob-stories them about
his own puppy who ran away.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.173
When they drop
their defenses,

13:46.695 --> 13:48.784
he talks his way into their
homes and assaults them,

13:49.089 --> 13:50.568
stealing everything they have.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.700
Assaults them sexually?

13:52.005 --> 13:53.833
Just physically and mentally.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.226
Our vic was lucky she saw us.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.532
Till you let him waltz.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.881
Not for nothing,
Detective,

13:59.186 --> 14:00.100
but I don't see him locked up

14:00.622 --> 14:01.841
in one of your state pens
either.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.886
Difference is, I lost him
when he skipped bail.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.846
You lost him on failure
of policing 101.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.586
Thank you for the lesson
in policing 101,

14:08.891 --> 14:10.197
and now here's one in return.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.504
You have no jurisdiction here
and no police power.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.810
So we'll be the ones
to end this guy's

14:15.115 --> 14:16.986
reign of terror, thank you.

14:18.945 --> 14:19.902
Let's hope so.

14:30.173 --> 14:33.481
So, say someone you know... Like a cop?

14:33.785 --> 14:35.483
No, just a friend.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.051
But they're doing
something kind of dodgy,

14:38.573 --> 14:40.575
and if their boss finds out,
they would get jammed up.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.012
Jammed up how?
Can't say.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.057
Why not?

14:44.579 --> 14:45.449
Actually, I've already said
too much.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.974
- You barely started.
- Nope. Done.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.410
You go.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.978
Okay.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.544
So let's say someone
you know really well...

14:53.893 --> 14:55.416
- Like a friend?
- No, like a cop.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.636
And you discover that they
pose a danger to themselves.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.595
- What kind of danger?
- I can't say.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902
Why not?
'Cause I promised.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.643
And this cop was
a really great cop

15:05.948 --> 15:07.123
for a long time.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.690
Was or is?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.866
You know what,
now I've said too much.

15:12.694 --> 15:13.608
Good talk, husband.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.958
As always, wife.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.094
What do we got?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.139
- Detectives, this is the guy.
- You called the tip-line?

15:23.661 --> 15:25.881
Right after I rode up
with Iris on the elevator.

15:26.186 --> 15:29.624
Usually, I can't get her
to stop talking, but this time

15:29.929 --> 15:32.105
she was clammed up,
and with some guy.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.934
Can you give us a description
more than just "some guy"?

15:35.282 --> 15:38.154
Average height, squirrely.
Real intense.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.504
Okay. You know where
we can find them?

15:40.809 --> 15:41.853
She's in apartment 3B.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.334
Thanks.
Wait down here.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.727
Yes, ma'am.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.301
Iris? Police. Open up.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.440
Police!

16:03.788 --> 16:04.964
Check the bedroom.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.014
He's in the wind.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.848
It's okay. Police, ma'am.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.198
It's okay. Call a bus.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.636
It's okay, ma'am,
it's okay. Baez!

16:25.941 --> 16:27.247
Call a bus.

16:36.908 --> 16:37.692
It's hard to remember.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.128
I-I was so scared.

16:41.652 --> 16:42.566
Did he say his name?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.307
Bill something.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.656
Bill Smith.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.267
And he asked about your dog?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.051
Yeah. He said he lost his.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.314
He kept saying "the chip."
The dog had a chip.

16:51.836 --> 16:55.579
But his phone was dead,
so we should use my computer.

16:55.884 --> 16:59.670
And I said no,
but he insisted.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.672
I'm such an idiot.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.197
It's not your fault, ma'am.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.286
Excuse me.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.029
It's gonna be okay.
All right?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.161
You take care of her.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.297
Hey.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.081
You all right?

17:19.386 --> 17:23.259
Just a bit dizzy.
I didn't eat today.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.000
That's funny, 'cause
I'm pretty sure I saw you

17:25.305 --> 17:27.263
scarf down an entire hero
all by yourself

17:27.307 --> 17:28.351
about an hour ago.

17:28.873 --> 17:32.312
You ever get that thing
where you're a rookie

17:32.355 --> 17:33.617
all over again,

17:33.922 --> 17:35.750
and suddenly a case is
following you home?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.448
Yeah. It's called being
a human being.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.495
You ever get tired of it?

17:41.799 --> 17:42.713
Being a human being?

17:43.062 --> 17:46.108
No, this, all of this.
Day in, day out.

17:46.413 --> 17:50.373
Years of seeing brutalized
victims like Iris in there.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.811
Yeah. All the time.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.248
Comes with the job.
You know that.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.859
And now we have people
putting us on trial

17:58.164 --> 18:00.079
with their cell phones
at every turn.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.603
Unfortunately, that comes
with the job now, too.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.779
We deal with it.

18:05.084 --> 18:09.653
Every cop has a mid-life...

18:09.958 --> 18:13.396
mid-career crisis of some sort.

18:13.744 --> 18:14.919
All of us. Me, too.

18:15.224 --> 18:18.097
Except I don't have
a husband to divorce,

18:18.401 --> 18:20.534
or a car to trade in
for a Corvette.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.318
All I've got is this job.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.191
You got me.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.370
Maybe you're better off
handling this one on your own.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.893
Okay?

18:40.945 --> 18:42.164
Knock-knock.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.470
Hey.

18:43.774 --> 18:44.645
Hi.
Have a seat.

18:44.949 --> 18:48.127
Um, I need some legal advice.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.041
So you finally came
to your senses.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.435
You're gonna love
my divorce lawyer.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.784
Me and Jamie are fine.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.179
It's about a friend of mine
who is pregnant.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.834
- A <i>friend?
- It's a fellow cop.</i>

19:00.139 --> 19:02.837
She screwed up; she didn't
notify the department.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.187
It sounds more like
employment law

19:05.492 --> 19:08.408
or union issues, neither
of which are up my alley.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.496
How do you do it, Erin?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.151
Do what?
Everything.

19:12.455 --> 19:16.155
You have an amazing career,
you raised a beautiful daughter.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.461
You have basically been
kicking ass in a man's world,

19:18.983 --> 19:21.334
- and you did it all by yourself.
- But I haven't.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.032
- Come on.
- All the "by myself" stuff,

19:24.337 --> 19:27.427
I grew up with my mom,
I've had Anthony,

19:27.470 --> 19:29.168
I co-parented with Jack.

19:29.472 --> 19:33.476
And I've had the rest of you
as my... Greek chorus,

19:33.998 --> 19:36.610
singing songs that I didn't
always want to hear,

19:36.914 --> 19:39.482
but sometimes neededto hear.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.354
You have a tribe.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.486
I have a tribe.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.532
This woman has no one.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.055
She has you.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.013
- When she's not avoiding me.
- Okay, so don't let her.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.841
Track her down.
Remind her that

19:51.190 --> 19:53.670
we sisters have got to
stick together.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.846
Can two women even make a tribe?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.935
Yeah. When one of them
is Eddie Janko,

19:58.240 --> 20:01.025
that's worth at least
a dozen men.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.687
And the price for this
system upgrade?

20:10.992 --> 20:12.776
Next page.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.430
Their rough stab at it,
calculated

20:14.952 --> 20:17.564
from similar overhauls Aegis &
Associates have implemented

20:17.868 --> 20:19.914
in European cities.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.090
Nice work if you can get it.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.613
Makes paying the ransom
look like the bargain.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.225
And Ms. Thompson herself?

20:27.356 --> 20:28.966
Professional opinion?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.708
Both.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.623
Very impressive.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.190
But?

20:37.888 --> 20:40.064
Perhaps not above
trying to make this deal

20:40.413 --> 20:44.373
by leveraging a prior
personal relationship.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.512
After your detail changed
your morning pickup

20:53.034 --> 20:56.255
from Bay Ridge
to Manhattan those times...

20:56.559 --> 20:58.605
I did put
two and two together.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.917
Well, Abigail,

21:07.222 --> 21:10.747
those times were
a long time ago.

21:11.052 --> 21:14.011
Long but not forgotten?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.189
No, see, that's the thing.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.931
I guess I had forgotten
because when she told me

21:21.236 --> 21:22.672
she'd been back here
for a while,

21:22.977 --> 21:25.719
and obviously hadn't called,

21:26.023 --> 21:28.548
well, it's not like it landed

21:28.591 --> 21:31.420
as anything on me, so...

21:33.422 --> 21:35.163
Why?

21:35.468 --> 21:37.383
You're asking me?

21:37.426 --> 21:39.515
Apparently.

21:40.037 --> 21:42.126
This is always a trap.
You tell me.

21:46.087 --> 21:49.133
Or don't. Up to you.

21:49.438 --> 21:53.050
Okay, uh, maybe one day,

21:53.355 --> 21:56.271
when I was really busy
with other stuff,

21:56.576 --> 22:00.406
that part of me that
would have been open to,

22:00.710 --> 22:03.844
I don't know,
that kind of relationship,

22:04.148 --> 22:08.805
maybe it just locked
from the inside.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.329
What, like a car?

22:10.677 --> 22:11.634
You're being pretty literal.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.332
And you're being pretty...

22:15.551 --> 22:17.988
Okay, beg to differ.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.468
No, thanks.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.600
That's an order.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.343
You didn't just ask her
probing questions yesterday,

22:24.691 --> 22:26.040
you peppered her with them--

22:26.345 --> 22:27.694
sinkers, sliders, spitballs--

22:27.998 --> 22:29.696
looking for a personal reaction.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.657
Oh.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.009
You asked.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.451
Find out why she left
London Police

22:45.755 --> 22:47.453
without my fingerprints on it.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.281
Yes, sir.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.202
Is there someone here?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.596
Oh, hey, Pop.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.600
This chimney hasn't
been cleaned

23:05.122 --> 23:07.255
since I could fit
all the way up inside it

23:07.560 --> 23:08.691
hiding from Danny and Joe.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.302
And you decided to
try this again why?

23:11.607 --> 23:13.522
It's just overdue maintenance.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.873
I-I nailed down that
loose board on the staircase,

23:17.396 --> 23:18.658
and I got fire extinguishers
for under the sink

23:18.701 --> 23:20.311
and the upstairs closet.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.313
And I ordered a pie
from Grimaldi's,

23:22.618 --> 23:24.881
in there on the counter;
pepperoni, light sauce.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.275
And will you be feeding me
before or after you've finished

23:27.580 --> 23:29.059
childproofing the cabinets?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.496
What?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.933
- You're coddling me.
- No, I'm not.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.674
Yeah, you are, so cut it out.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.154
I was just trying
- to lend a hand.
- I've got two right here.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.547
And a bad knee
that would hurt for a week

23:39.069 --> 23:40.419
if you tried to do this
by yourself.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.421
What's the first thing
you do in the morning?

23:42.725 --> 23:44.423
Make my bed and exercise.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.556
And I take stock.
What is my name?

23:48.078 --> 23:50.080
What is my social security
number?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.561
- What city do I live in?
- Pop...

23:53.083 --> 23:56.435
Because I'm afraid that today
might finally be the day

23:56.783 --> 23:58.611
when I don't remember
those things.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.917
You got a long time
before that.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.572
But one day time will win,

24:04.094 --> 24:08.272
and no amount of age-proofing
this house will change that.

24:08.621 --> 24:11.711
So back off and let me be.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.105
You don't even want pizza?

24:15.410 --> 24:18.195
Oh, I'm keeping the pizza,
and I'll enjoy it.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.284
Good night, Jamison.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.168
Eddie's onto
something here.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.475
Full moons definitely
change people.

24:36.779 --> 24:37.954
Change like into werewolves?

24:38.302 --> 24:40.261
No, not like fur and fangs.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.656
Like, people get nuttier
when there is a full moon.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.049
And there's one this week,
so everybody look out.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.486
- I am with Sean on this.
Thank you.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.705
People are crazy
because they're crazy.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.578
Not because of the way
the planets are aligned.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.927
There you go.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.581
I seem to remember you
having an astrology phase.

24:55.624 --> 24:56.799
I did not!

24:57.321 --> 24:58.497
Well, don't listen to him.
He's a Libra.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.760
Well, personally,
I think astrology's crap,

25:01.282 --> 25:02.501
but as someone who's done
their share of midnights,

25:02.805 --> 25:04.633
full moons can definitely
make things

25:05.155 --> 25:07.331
get a little hairy
out there on the street.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.724
- Hairy?
- Hairy.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.509
Come on, that was
- a good joke. Come on.
- No.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.336
Hairy. Full moon.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.643
- Werewolves.
- Must've missed it.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.471
How else do you explain
my partner's behavior lately?

25:16.776 --> 25:18.255
She's completely shut me out.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.648
- Full moon.
There's a lot of that

25:20.170 --> 25:22.216
- going around.
- Yeah. Don't remind me.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.522
Wait, you're
spilling secrets to her?

25:23.826 --> 25:24.523
What are you talking about?

25:24.827 --> 25:25.785
I hate to tell you, Danny.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.438
That whole full moon thing
is a myth.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.440
- I don't know, Dad.
- And how do you know?

25:29.745 --> 25:31.355
Well, when I first started
working the streets,

25:31.660 --> 25:33.488
I saw all that craziness,
so I asked Pop.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.185
He set me straight. Right, Pop?

25:35.534 --> 25:36.665
Hmm.

25:37.666 --> 25:38.798
Was that a yes?

25:38.841 --> 25:39.842
I guess.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.017
You okay down there,
Gramps?

25:41.365 --> 25:42.062
Yeah, he's fine.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.193
I can speak for myself,

25:43.542 --> 25:44.368
thank you very much.

25:44.717 --> 25:45.805
Okay, let's put

25:45.848 --> 25:47.023
the fangs away, boys.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.503
- Fangs.
We, uh,

25:48.808 --> 25:50.113
talk through our problems
here at the table.

25:50.636 --> 25:53.334
Except for those people who keep
trying to fix someone else's

25:53.639 --> 25:54.901
without their permission.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.467
Whatever, Pop.

25:56.772 --> 25:57.904
Yeah, "whatever" yourself.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.209
Nothing you two

25:59.514 --> 26:00.776
want to talk about?

26:00.820 --> 26:02.038
Not a thing.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.518
All good.

26:04.780 --> 26:08.262
Maybe that whole full moon thing
isn't a myth after all.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.611
- Mm-hmm.
Just saying.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.395
Just...

26:11.700 --> 26:13.659
- May I have the butter, please?
Yeah.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.930
Okay, Jamie, enough.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.106
- Enough what?
- Enough of you

26:26.410 --> 26:27.455
not telling what's going on

26:27.760 --> 26:29.588
even though it's obviously
about you and Henry.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.590
Fine. I'm worried about him.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.592
- In what way?
- In the way

26:33.896 --> 26:35.376
that he almost burned
down the house last week.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.247
- What?!
- Then demanded I clam up.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.249
What, even to me?

26:39.598 --> 26:40.599
It was a blanket threat.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.513
You still
should've told me.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.603
I mean, everyone gets older

26:44.907 --> 26:47.388
sooner or later.
Other people have to step in.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.608
And I did. Hard. Maybe too hard.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.306
Pop's always been
a hero of mine,

26:52.828 --> 26:54.569
and I just want to pay that
back in spades, but now I feel

26:54.874 --> 26:55.962
like I've hurt his feelings

26:56.484 --> 26:58.094
and I can't even broach
the subject again

26:58.442 --> 26:59.618
without hurting him more.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.751
Oh, is he too stubborn
to accept an apology?

27:03.273 --> 27:04.405
Have you met
my grandfather?

27:04.710 --> 27:07.495
Well,

27:07.800 --> 27:10.454
maybe instead of making it

27:10.803 --> 27:12.935
about how scared
you are for him,

27:13.457 --> 27:16.417
you make it
about how much you need him.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.637
- Meaning?
- Sometimes the best way

27:18.941 --> 27:20.987
to apologize
is to ask for a favor.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.599
Okay.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.601
So, now your secret.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.821
No.

27:29.343 --> 27:32.825
After I just spilled mine?
And you obviously told Erin.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.261
Just give me a chance

27:34.565 --> 27:36.959
to take my own advice.

27:47.883 --> 27:50.407
Not a single Gavin Powers

27:50.712 --> 27:52.322
in the entire
tristate. Hmm.

27:52.845 --> 27:55.674
Guess I'll just have to sort
through all these Bill Smiths.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.719
I know what you're doing,
Reagan.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.070
Be fun to help, won't it?

28:01.375 --> 28:02.985
- Didn't say that.
- Well,

28:03.507 --> 28:05.422
then I guess
I'll just have to be on my way.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.687
Got to start knocking
on all these doors.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.384
What are you, an idiot?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.560
Powers was smart to use

28:12.865 --> 28:14.301
a common name as an alias,
which means you got

28:14.823 --> 28:16.956
about a hundred names
- on that list.
- No, actually.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.566
Only 87.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.700
Which will take you
about a month to track down.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.571
You want a fighting chance,
whittle your list

28:23.876 --> 28:26.269
down to all the Bill Smiths
living in the area

28:26.574 --> 28:27.706
of the last few assaults.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.882
Perps like that
usually like to work an area.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.623
You know, I could've sworn
you were off this case.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.365
I could've sworn
you were a good detective.

28:35.670 --> 28:36.584
I am.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.021
Though I'm better with you.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.868
Speak of the devil.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.742
Behave yourself.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.616
Sloane. Please.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.620
Is this the one that opens
onto the piranha tank?

29:12.925 --> 29:14.100
No, it's that one.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.802
Look, I'm sorry, uh,

29:21.107 --> 29:23.065
for being so tough on you
the other day.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.240
Oh, not at all.

29:24.545 --> 29:25.981
Yes, at all.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.243
A stressful time.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.332
Yeah, well, I remember.

29:29.637 --> 29:30.594
And cyberattacks
are right up there

29:30.943 --> 29:32.727
on the scale, so...

29:36.513 --> 29:39.429
"The NYPD welcomes the alliance
with Aegis & Associates

29:39.778 --> 29:41.040
"to assess and upgrade

29:41.562 --> 29:43.825
"the security
of its computer capabilities

29:43.869 --> 29:45.261
citywide."

29:45.566 --> 29:46.785
Check the spelling and grammar,

29:47.089 --> 29:49.613
and we'll release it
to the press.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.268
I'm chuffed.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.966
I take it that means "happy."

29:54.009 --> 29:54.793
Very.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.620
- Then we both are.
- But

29:56.969 --> 29:58.492
in the fine print?

30:01.669 --> 30:03.453
We can only pay you

30:03.758 --> 30:06.152
a third of what you ask for.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.328
Really?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.286
Sloane...

30:10.809 --> 30:13.942
I'm not trying to take advantage
of our friendship.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.771
But there are some
- harsh realities in my budget.
- Well,

30:17.076 --> 30:19.469
- I'll take it to my board.
- Hopefully,

30:19.818 --> 30:20.862
with the recommendation

30:21.167 --> 30:23.343
that the discount
will be more than made up

30:23.647 --> 30:26.737
with the coin
of the NYPD's reputation

30:27.042 --> 30:30.132
when you approach Paris,
Tel Aviv,

30:30.176 --> 30:32.221
Geneva, et cetera.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.096
You are always one step ahead.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.967
I try to be.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.842
Sloane,

30:44.146 --> 30:47.628
tell me about Gerald Foster.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.328
Clearly, you already know.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.723
Only the official story
of your retirement.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.508
With rumors
of sexual harassment,

30:58.857 --> 31:00.249
a seven-figure settlement,

31:00.771 --> 31:03.513
out on Friday with full honors
and a pension

31:03.862 --> 31:06.690
and in your new job on Monday.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.999
That's mostly the facts.

31:11.521 --> 31:15.525
To say anything more would be
to violate a very robust NDA.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.137
Which would've hurt
for you to sign.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.616
In this day and age?

31:19.921 --> 31:22.010
For a cop like you?
For a woman like you?

31:22.054 --> 31:23.533
Yeah.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.884
Honestly?

31:26.232 --> 31:28.103
What hurts just about the same

31:28.625 --> 31:29.757
is the fact
that I've been reduced

31:30.062 --> 31:32.107
to the subject
of your investigation.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.154
Well, I didn't mean
to offend you.

31:35.197 --> 31:36.111
Well, you have.

31:36.633 --> 31:37.983
I was concerned, that's all.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.942
About my well-being? Or about
the fact that I didn't ring you?

31:40.986 --> 31:42.552
Here.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.207
This can be shredded.

31:45.555 --> 31:46.905
Have a good day.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.616
Hey, there you are.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.747
And here I go.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.620
Look, I know
you're avoiding me.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.578
- So take the hint.
- Please, I just...

32:08.883 --> 32:10.580
I need some advice.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.453
From me?
Yeah, from you.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.282
'Cause, you know,
one of these days,

32:16.586 --> 32:18.588
I'm gonna start a family, too,

32:18.937 --> 32:21.287
and I'd love to hear
your experience.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.766
You know, woman-to-woman.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.030
Hmm, so you can
blab that around, too?

32:25.073 --> 32:26.422
What?

32:26.727 --> 32:27.902
Cora,

32:28.207 --> 32:29.948
nobody asked,
and I did not say anything.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.515
Then why did my detective
interview get canceled?

32:32.820 --> 32:35.301
- What? Oh, no.
- Like you didn't

32:35.823 --> 32:37.868
tell your husband and he
- didn't rat me out to them.
- No.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.132
No, I didn't, and I wouldn't.
And neither would Jamie.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.437
Look,

32:41.785 --> 32:43.787
I know this has not been easy.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.094
Janko, you know nothing.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.055
Not about me
and not about my baby.

32:50.359 --> 32:53.319
So, now I got to figure out how
I'm gonna make a future for her,

32:53.362 --> 32:54.885
and the last thing I need

32:55.190 --> 32:59.238
is some two-faced "girl power"
pep talk from you.

33:09.639 --> 33:10.858
This is exhausting.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.730
Well, I whittled it down
to 11 doors just for you.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.515
Well, tell that to my feet.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.908
This is our door here.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.306
Bill Smith?

33:24.654 --> 33:26.700
Who's asking?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.703
Police. Just want
to ask you a few questions.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.357
- You mind opening the door?
Sorry.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.141
I can't help you.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.233
Smith,
it'll just be a second.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.761
Drop it!

33:47.329 --> 33:49.288
Stay there!

33:51.029 --> 33:52.117
Baez!

33:52.160 --> 33:53.161
Danny.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.729
Baez. Hey!

33:56.034 --> 33:58.558
Come here. Come here.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.125
Oh, my God.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.084
It's okay.

34:03.389 --> 34:07.088
Hey. Hey. Stay awake.
Stay with me.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.194
I hope you left some

34:26.716 --> 34:28.283
for the kids at the state fair.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.633
Uh, not much.

34:30.938 --> 34:32.331
Figured this stuff
would cheer you up

34:32.853 --> 34:34.115
or make you want
to get back on your feet

34:34.420 --> 34:35.899
and get the hell out
of this room.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.427
It was just a couple of pellets
that barely grazed me.

34:41.731 --> 34:42.863
Yeah.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.474
Little too close for comfort
if you ask me.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.390
Thank you.

34:48.738 --> 34:49.913
Course.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.394
You have company.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.875
Iris came by the squad
to say thank you,

34:55.180 --> 34:56.833
and I told her that

34:57.138 --> 34:58.792
I'm not the one
she should be thanking.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.796
So... Come on in, Iris.

35:05.799 --> 35:07.409
I heard you got him.

35:07.453 --> 35:10.195
We got him. Yeah.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.153
Thank you.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.966
This the seat that opens up
on the piranha tank?

35:44.316 --> 35:45.360
I hope so.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.322
Thanks for signing us up.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.498
- That was a board decision.
- Well,

35:52.802 --> 35:55.457
then thank you for not
torpedoing me with the board.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.894
I'm a professional.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.290
So, what's good here?

36:02.638 --> 36:06.294
The solitude, usually.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.950
I'm sorry.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.823
I'm very sorry.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.174
You could've just asked
what happened.

36:16.522 --> 36:17.958
I should have.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.916
And cops don't like coincidence.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.832
What are you even doing here?
Did you have me followed?

36:23.355 --> 36:24.312
Well, I could tell you
I looked up

36:24.617 --> 36:26.096
authentic English pubs
near your office,

36:26.401 --> 36:28.011
but yeah, I had you followed.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.936
Sloane, look,

36:40.459 --> 36:44.114
Gerald Foster comes to New York
three or four times a year.

36:44.637 --> 36:47.205
I can check and see
if he packs his nasty habits

36:47.509 --> 36:49.207
when he travels.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.209
No. Absolutely not.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.994
What's done is done. Understood?

36:55.038 --> 36:57.563
Yeah, okay.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.222
Two Boddingtons.

37:04.526 --> 37:06.093
What's Boddingtons?

37:06.398 --> 37:08.574
What you're having.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.360
- Okay.
- Frank,

37:12.708 --> 37:14.884
I'm sorry I didn't ring,

37:15.407 --> 37:17.844
but then you didn't ring,
either.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.023
I think we're both old enough
and smart enough

37:23.545 --> 37:25.808
to know what we are
and are not capable of.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.028
Like dialing a phone number?

37:30.813 --> 37:32.032
The kind of relationships

37:32.554 --> 37:35.992
we once thought were so vital
to a happy life.

37:36.515 --> 37:40.432
It's not bad to embrace the fact
that those days passed us by

37:40.736 --> 37:43.086
when we were busy
doing other things.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.045
Hmm.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.224
So, you think you got me
all figured out, huh?

37:51.573 --> 37:54.228
You have your work.
You live with your father.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.274
You host family meals for fun.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.406
Both things are true.

37:59.581 --> 38:02.497
I have my job, the pub,

38:02.802 --> 38:05.065
my flat, a few friends.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.937
I can't say
that I'm ecstatically happy.

38:08.460 --> 38:12.420
But I can say
I'm hardly ever sad.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.904
And that's saying a whole lot.

38:19.862 --> 38:20.950
Cheers.

38:22.735 --> 38:23.953
Cheers.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.612
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

38:30.960 --> 38:33.789
The precinct
is open 24 hours a day.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.053
No, ma'am,
we do not rent firearms.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.625
Ma'am, you have
a blessed day, as well.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.497
Thank you for calling.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.636
- Sarge.
- You better get going.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.291
- You're gonna be late.
- For what?

38:57.813 --> 38:59.467
Your interview
at the Chief of D's office.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.251
That was canceled,

39:01.774 --> 39:04.124
- as you know.
- It's back on. About 15 minutes.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.299
Are you serious?

39:05.821 --> 39:07.997
Felton, two things are
true in any precinct.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.825
lot of things get noticed

39:10.173 --> 39:11.523
even if you don't think they do,

39:11.827 --> 39:13.481
like someone in the
ladies' locker room

39:14.003 --> 39:16.049
getting morning sickness every
day for the last few weeks.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.965
- It wasn't you.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.184
sometimes a boss
sees a bad move being made,

39:21.533 --> 39:22.490
and they can rectify it

39:22.795 --> 39:24.187
if they know
the right arm to twist.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.800
Like, say, the arm of a guy
that I know on the DB panel.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.455
- You didn't.
- And if you were

39:30.759 --> 39:32.152
to admit your mistake

39:32.674 --> 39:34.720
and tell them that you see
the error of your ways,

39:35.024 --> 39:36.983
then it will have been
worth my while.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.204
Hoffman.

39:41.727 --> 39:44.251
Take, uh, Felton down to
headquarters on the double.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.253
Take the supervisors' RMP.

39:47.602 --> 39:48.429
Thank you, sir.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.213
Good luck.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.440
See what happens

39:59.962 --> 40:01.790
when you finally fess up
- to what's going on around here?
- Like you were

40:02.095 --> 40:04.140
- Mr. Forthcoming.
- I'm about to be

40:04.663 --> 40:06.186
Mr. I Got to Get Going.
I got a porch to build.

40:07.709 --> 40:08.623
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.887
- Love you.
- Love you.

40:19.895 --> 40:21.070
What

40:21.593 --> 40:23.116
- in God's name?
- I knocked
on the front door,

40:23.159 --> 40:24.465
but you didn't answer.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.293
I was out buying
lotto tickets.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.816
- Oh.
- So, what,

40:28.121 --> 40:29.252
you're gonna board me in

40:29.775 --> 40:30.732
so I can't burn down
the whole neighborhood?

40:31.037 --> 40:34.127
Actually,
I was gonna ask you for a favor.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.825
- Like?
- Back porch has been
going to crap for years.

40:37.130 --> 40:38.566
I figured since you built it,
you could

40:38.914 --> 40:40.002
supervise the rebuild.

40:40.307 --> 40:41.613
Kid,
I've worked for enough mayors

40:41.917 --> 40:43.919
to recognize that old ruse.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.880
Were they too proud
to accept help, too?

40:48.184 --> 40:50.448
I'll accept help when I need it.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.407
Hey. You know what I need?

40:54.756 --> 40:57.063
I need the guy I've looked up to
my whole life

40:57.367 --> 40:59.108
to be around
for as long as possible,

40:59.631 --> 41:01.154
because the older I get,
the more questions I got

41:01.676 --> 41:03.809
about how to be the best cop
and how to be the best husband

41:04.113 --> 41:06.115
and how to be
the best man I can be.

41:06.638 --> 41:09.292
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
sit in some graveyard

41:09.815 --> 41:13.079
talking to your headstone
about all this before I have to.

41:13.383 --> 41:15.516
Though that granite
might be less thick

41:15.821 --> 41:17.300
than your head is sometimes.

41:21.914 --> 41:24.656
I hope you kept your receipts.

41:26.092 --> 41:27.441
To return it? I know.

41:27.746 --> 41:28.790
Just some of it.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.489
The porch is only ten by 12.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.055
Unless you were planning

41:33.360 --> 41:35.405
on us rebuilding
the entire damn house.
