00:04.480 --> 00:07.390
- What'd she say?
- It's complicated.

00:07.390 --> 00:09.820
- I know you.
You didn't talk to her.

00:09.820 --> 00:11.820
- Six years together,
she's just not gonna

00:11.830 --> 00:14.360
give me the thumbs up
to move on.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.630
I'm strategizing.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.460
- Me too.

00:20.630 --> 00:22.130
- Where are you going?

00:22.140 --> 00:24.700
- It's complicated.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.720
- Well, there's not
much to tell.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.950
My secretary and I were sitting
there, preparing for a meeting

00:41.960 --> 00:45.590
and then... no, not now... and then
she goes to the bathroom

00:45.590 --> 00:46.860
and then all of the sudden,
the water just from above...

00:46.860 --> 00:49.130
- lemont's kind of
a sleepy town.

00:49.130 --> 00:50.760
This is my first dead body.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.130
- We can ship a couple of our
overflow up here if you want.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.930
- I'm in charge.
Captain fogarty.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.830
- Oh, nagel, Dawson.
Thanks for calling.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.940
- Under the circumstances,
I figure this is your ballpark.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.140
Manager said that he made
the reservation online.

01:03.140 --> 01:06.410
- Not even when he checked in?
- Didn't have to.

01:06.410 --> 01:09.480
Keycard on the door,
changes for every new customer.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.880
Wallet was in his pocket.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.820
- Any security footage?
- People who come here

01:12.820 --> 01:14.550
don't really want
a record of it.

01:14.550 --> 01:16.420
- In here?

01:22.630 --> 01:25.000
- Yeah, I'd say he's dead.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.500
- Mm-hmm.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.030
- Here.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.740
Excuse me?

01:32.740 --> 01:37.740
- I figured I could
learn something.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.980
Slit wrists.
Pretty obvious suicide.

01:40.980 --> 01:42.910
- Nope. Nothing.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.220
Hot water. Whoever did this
wanted the body to decompose.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.690
- What do you mean,
whoever did this?

01:47.690 --> 01:50.490
He did it.
- Look again, officer.

01:50.490 --> 01:51.660
What's missing?

01:54.930 --> 02:00.600
- A knife.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.800
- Maybe officer jonesy will
get us a cup of coffee

02:02.800 --> 02:04.540
while we discuss the case.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.500
- That's one hell of a way
for a cop to go.

02:06.510 --> 02:08.039
- Yeah.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.940
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Did you just say

02:09.940 --> 02:11.480
the victim was a cop?

02:11.480 --> 02:13.480
- Your boss didn't tell you?

02:13.480 --> 02:18.020
Officer jonesy,
meet officer Ted Cody,

02:18.020 --> 02:19.820
Chicago pd.

02:28.860 --> 02:32.060
- Cause of dead, broken neck.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.530
Judging by these severe
cervical vertebral fractures,

02:34.530 --> 02:36.970
I'd say officer Cody
was face down,

02:36.970 --> 02:39.200
the killer put a knee here and...

02:39.210 --> 02:41.540
Snapped his head back.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.070
- And the ankles?
- Can't say.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.980
Maybe when he hit the tub.

02:44.980 --> 02:48.650
Also, he was Mike tysoned.
- The guy bit his ear?

02:48.650 --> 02:50.550
- Someone with
very strong fingers

02:50.550 --> 02:53.550
did a grab, pull and rip.

02:53.550 --> 02:55.250
No pulmonary edema,
minimal bleeding,

02:55.260 --> 02:57.150
he was dead before
his wrists were cut

02:57.160 --> 02:58.520
and was dumped into the tub.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.190
- So someone went to
a lot of trouble

03:00.190 --> 03:02.230
to make us think
that this was a suicide.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.660
- Like we're gonna miss
a broken neck.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.600
- Us, no.
But the locals might.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
- See the jagged nature
of the cuts?

03:07.600 --> 03:10.230
I'd say we're looking at
a bread knife.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.540
Something like that.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.070
- Because the body
was in hot water,

03:14.070 --> 03:17.040
I'd say the tod was sometime
around noon yesterday.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.540
Give or take.

03:18.550 --> 03:19.540
- Okay.
- Thanks, joy.

03:19.550 --> 03:21.310
- Oh, it gets better.

03:21.310 --> 03:24.050
Officer Cody had
pancreatic cancer.

03:24.050 --> 03:27.650
He didn't have more than
six weeks left on this planet.

03:27.650 --> 03:30.590
We found traces of gemcitabine
oxaliplatin... that's chemo...

03:30.590 --> 03:33.260
Along with some alcohol
in his blood.

03:33.260 --> 03:36.890
That's a big no-no.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.260
- I always thought
I'd get that call

03:38.260 --> 03:40.000
in the middle of the night,
you know?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.070
Shot on duty, car accident.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.140
Suicide never even
crossed my mind.

03:45.140 --> 03:49.010
I guess it makes sense,
with the pain and medicines.

03:49.010 --> 03:51.610
Bills piling up.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Cody.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.250
Nobody told you?
- Told me what?

03:54.250 --> 03:58.180
- Your husband...
- Former husband.

03:58.180 --> 04:00.120
- We're thinking he may have
been murdered.

04:04.290 --> 04:08.290
He was a selfish prick, okay?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.330
He insisted on dying alone.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.600
Soon as he was diagnosed,
he moved out.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.600
- When was that?
- Eight months ago.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.100
- I don't even know
what I'm gonna do for money.

04:17.100 --> 04:21.610
I just... he was giving me
1,200 a month in cash.

04:21.610 --> 04:26.080
He was working another job to
help with tj... that's our son.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.610
- You okay, mom?

04:28.620 --> 04:30.310
- I'm fine, babe.
- This about dad?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.320
- Mm-hmm.
Why don't you go back inside?

04:32.320 --> 04:36.620
I'll tell you in a minute.

04:40.330 --> 04:43.060
He's Ted's pride, you know?

04:43.060 --> 04:45.760
He got accepted into
four Ivy league schools.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.400
That's not bad
for a son of a cop.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.240
- There should be a law
against cops getting married.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.040
- Thought they had one already.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.940
So is officer Cody
a martyr or a mook?

05:01.350 --> 05:03.780
- His ex wasn't lying
about medical bills.

05:03.780 --> 05:07.350
You got x-rays, surgeries,
meds, insurance.

05:07.350 --> 05:10.190
Second notice, third notice.

05:10.190 --> 05:12.260
Looks like he owes about
half a mil.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.430
- I had six weeks to go,
I'd make 'em wait, too.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.300
Whoa.

05:28.670 --> 05:31.710
- I'd say this is about
20 grand times two.

05:31.710 --> 05:35.080
- You're kidding.
- Hey, I used to work narcotics.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.280
- Things are starting
to lean towards mook.

05:39.290 --> 05:44.090
But since he got put on a desk,
we don't talk so much anymore.

05:44.090 --> 05:47.120
- Oh, that's nice.
But we didn't ask that.

05:47.130 --> 05:50.260
- Fine.
I was his last partner, yeah.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.400
- Where'd you work?
- North side.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.230
Lake view, Lincoln park.

05:54.230 --> 05:56.100
Blue haired ladies looking for
their lost labradoodles.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.770
Not exactly high-risk stuff.

05:57.770 --> 05:59.270
- Let me ask you this,
officer Hawkins.

05:59.270 --> 06:02.170
If I were to go to your crib,
make myself a drink,

06:02.180 --> 06:03.310
go to your freezer,
get some ice.

06:03.310 --> 06:04.780
What am I gonna find?

06:04.780 --> 06:06.310
- What is this, "jeopardy"?

06:06.310 --> 06:08.250
- Just answer the question.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.720
- My freezer?
Uh, a couple of brats,

06:11.720 --> 06:13.280
mint chocolate chip ice cream.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.720
I don't know, what?
- No cash?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.090
- What the hell
are you implying?

06:17.090 --> 06:18.790
- Your partner...
- Former partner.

06:18.790 --> 06:21.060
- He had almost
40 grand stashed away.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.360
Do you know anything about that?

06:22.360 --> 06:24.260
- No way.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.360
You wanna go through my fridge?
My underwear drawer?

06:26.370 --> 06:28.370
Help yourselves.
I got nothing to hide.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.500
If Cody was into something,
I don't know nothing about it.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.270
- When's the last time
you saw him?

06:32.270 --> 06:35.240
- The last time I said hello
was, like, two weeks ago.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.210
Truth is, dying guys
kinda give me the willies.

06:37.210 --> 06:39.480
Have a good day.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.280
- So you're ruling out his ex.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.050
- Actually, I think
she loved the guy.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.450
- Either way, she wasn't strong
enough to break his neck

06:45.450 --> 06:47.150
even if he was dying.

06:47.150 --> 06:49.120
You sure?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.820
- You know how many carcinogens
are in a hot dog?

06:51.820 --> 06:53.360
- Too late now.
- Officer Cody's

06:53.360 --> 06:55.130
former partner
is a sack of nails.

06:55.130 --> 06:57.060
Not my first choice
if I were gonna run a scam.

06:59.330 --> 07:01.100
Hang on.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.470
Nagel.
Yeah.

07:03.470 --> 07:05.270
- Seriously, though,
I don't eat meat.

07:05.270 --> 07:07.140
- Thanks, Ronnie.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.410
Ronnie ran Cody's
incoming and outgoing.

07:09.410 --> 07:12.380
He called the sack of nails
three times.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.780
- It's not what you think.
- No?

07:16.780 --> 07:18.150
Why don't you tell us
what it is?

07:18.150 --> 07:19.420
- Well, I don't know you.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.450
You come asking me questions
about some dead guy.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.160
- Telling the truth
works for me.

07:24.160 --> 07:28.460
- What were you and Cody
talking about the day he died?

07:28.460 --> 07:29.930
- Meat.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.360
- What?

07:31.360 --> 07:34.330
- This is really the story
you're going with?

07:34.330 --> 07:38.570
Cody had a standing order
at some north side butcher.

07:38.570 --> 07:41.210
Steaks, chops,
all kinds of meat.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.170
Once a month...
Because he was desked up...

07:43.180 --> 07:45.840
I would go pick it up for him
out of the kindness of my heart.

07:45.850 --> 07:48.510
- Okay.
How much meat we talking?

07:48.510 --> 07:50.510
In dollars?
- I don't know.

07:50.520 --> 07:54.150
A lot. A couple a grand.
- On a cop's salary?

07:54.150 --> 07:56.250
- All I know is I would
walk in the front door

07:56.260 --> 07:57.860
and they would hand me
a couple of cartons.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.490
It was totally legit.

07:59.490 --> 08:03.530
- I just assumed Cody
was in tight with the owner.

08:03.530 --> 08:05.230
He'd get the meat at a discount

08:05.230 --> 08:06.560
and sell it to the guys
for a profit.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.430
- All due respect,
if it was all legit,

08:08.430 --> 08:10.270
why did you lie about it?

08:10.270 --> 08:11.370
- You know it is against regs

08:11.370 --> 08:13.500
to do personal business
on city time.

08:13.510 --> 08:15.540
I didn't need the bosses
coming down on me.

08:15.540 --> 08:16.970
- We're gonna talk
to this butcher, Hawkins.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.880
So help me, if you're lying...
- who is he?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.510
- Beckett's meats.

08:21.510 --> 08:24.420
It's over on, um...

08:24.420 --> 08:25.850
- I know where it is.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.429
- John Beckett.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.289
- The one and only.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.360
- What am I missing?

08:42.299 --> 08:44.440
- Five years ago...

08:44.440 --> 08:48.010
Beckett owns a small farm
and meat packing warehouse.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.470
He is up to his eyeballs
in debt.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.610
So he does what
any thinking man does.

08:52.610 --> 08:54.280
- Burns it all down.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.250
- For the insurance.
- He killed a lot of pigs,

08:56.250 --> 08:58.250
a whole bunch of chickens,
but more importantly,

08:58.250 --> 08:59.420
a farmer sleeping in the barn.

08:59.420 --> 09:03.320
- His name was Paul Marcus.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.390
- Okay.

09:05.390 --> 09:07.460
So that's felony murder,
not to mention

09:07.460 --> 09:09.290
numerous animal cruelty
felonies.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.460
- That's why I arrested him.
- Beckett's attorney

09:12.470 --> 09:15.570
argued that the fire was started
by an electrical short.

09:15.570 --> 09:18.300
- Fire marshal swore
up and down it was gasoline.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.900
- The jury deliberated
for four days.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.540
Four damn days.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.510
And then they acquitted
the son of a bitch.

09:26.980 --> 09:30.350
- I doubt Beckett was just being
nice to an ailing copper.

09:30.350 --> 09:32.480
- Go talk to him.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.320
- Gladly.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.970
- Johnny Beckett.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.270
- Detective Dawson, right?

09:52.270 --> 09:53.970
- It's sa investigator, now.

09:53.970 --> 09:56.610
This is investigator nagel.

09:56.610 --> 09:59.640
- Well, I realize we have
a special relationship,

09:59.650 --> 10:01.980
but for retail, you're gonna
have to go to the shop.

10:01.980 --> 10:04.680
- We're here about
cpd officer Ted Cody.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.020
- Who?
- He spent $2,000 a month

10:07.020 --> 10:08.090
in your store.

10:08.090 --> 10:10.720
- Yeah? A lot of people
spend more.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.460
- How many of them end up
murdered in a bathtub?

10:13.460 --> 10:15.130
- Are you accusing me
of something?

10:15.130 --> 10:17.290
- Breathing.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.300
- Cody lived alone.
He was dying.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.100
I doubt he'd be eating
that much meat.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.670
- Well, it's the best meat
in the city.

10:22.670 --> 10:25.100
- He was flush with cash,
hidden in his freezer.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.740
- Where the meat should've been.

10:26.740 --> 10:30.010
Did you talk to
the jolly green giant?

10:30.010 --> 10:31.310
- Screw you, Beckett.

10:31.310 --> 10:34.410
- Hey, the state and the feds
already have.

10:34.410 --> 10:37.410
Every time I turn around,
you people got a new regulation.

10:37.420 --> 10:40.080
- What's that gotta do
with Ted Cody?

10:40.090 --> 10:43.390
- So now what?
You're accusing me of murder.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.720
Again.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.330
Look, I already told you.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.390
I don't know officer Cody.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.500
But I am sorry
for the city's loss.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.060
Now I gotta get back to work.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.070
You wanna look around,
help yourself.

10:56.070 --> 10:59.100
Just, uh, watch where you step.

10:59.110 --> 11:00.740
Those look like nice shoes.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.110
- Guy's still an ass wipe.

11:06.110 --> 11:07.480
- I wonder if there's
a bar around here.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.510
- Yeah, that guy? I can use one.
- Not for us, Dawson.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.350
Alcohol in Cody's blood?

11:12.350 --> 11:14.490
There wasn't
a minibar in his room.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.490
- What can I get for you folks?
- Nothing for us.

11:21.490 --> 11:24.130
- Okay. What can I do for you?
- You ever seen this guy?

11:24.130 --> 11:27.060
- Yeah, a couple days ago.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.300
- How about him?

11:28.300 --> 11:31.370
- No, I don't think so.

11:31.370 --> 11:33.470
Yeah, he was here
with the first guy.

11:33.470 --> 11:35.240
- You happen to hear
what they were talking about?

11:35.240 --> 11:38.180
- It was kinda busy, you know?
Are they in trouble?

11:38.180 --> 11:39.480
- Thanks.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.080
- I had a good reason
to lie to you.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.520
- Yeah? We're really looking
forward to hearing it.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.350
<i>- Should I call my attorney now?</i>

11:50.360 --> 11:52.120
<i>- Hey, you clean up the lie,
you won't need to.</i>

11:52.120 --> 11:53.290
- Nice.

11:53.290 --> 11:56.830
<i>- Okay. Cody's a friend.</i>

11:56.830 --> 11:59.160
<i>He called in a bad state.</i>

11:59.170 --> 12:01.230
He can't take it anymore.

12:01.230 --> 12:04.200
The cancer, the money.
He wanted there to be

12:04.200 --> 12:06.340
something left for his kid.

12:06.340 --> 12:08.840
So he tells me
he's gonna end it all.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.080
- Did he ask you for money?
- No.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.840
No, he was a proud guy.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.480
Proud and stupid.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.210
I would've given him
whatever he wanted.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.480
- Mm. Where'd you go?

12:18.480 --> 12:20.250
- Local joint called Ernie's.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.150
See, I thought maybe
what he really wanted.

12:22.150 --> 12:26.590
We shot the breeze.
I thought everything was fine.

12:26.590 --> 12:29.130
So I went back to work
at the farm.

12:29.130 --> 12:31.160
<i>- You do realize
your life would be a lot easier</i>

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
<i>if you told us all that
from the get-go.</i>

12:33.170 --> 12:34.870
- When I heard he was dead,

12:34.870 --> 12:37.400
I thought for sure
you people would blame me.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.170
And it looks like I was right.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.770
Holy crap.

12:43.780 --> 12:46.340
The big guns, huh?
The heavy artillery.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.150
- Good to see you too,
Mr. Beckett.

12:48.150 --> 12:51.420
On that side of the table.
- Yeah, fine. I'm guilty.

12:51.420 --> 12:54.280
Guilty of honoring
a friend's last request.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.520
Keeping his confidentiality.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.560
- Cody's receipts
from your store,

12:58.560 --> 13:01.260
it didn't take Steve Jobs
to figure out they were fake.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.230
Probably cooked them up
the moment my investigators

13:03.230 --> 13:04.560
walked out of there.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.900
You were paying him off
for something in meat.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.530
- And cash.

13:08.530 --> 13:12.400
- I wanna know why.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.210
- On your mark. Get set.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.180
Call my lawyer.

13:26.150 --> 13:27.650
- Gail?

13:27.650 --> 13:30.250
- Hey, Peter.

13:30.260 --> 13:31.920
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:33.490 --> 13:36.890
- You look good.
- Eh, you don't have to lie.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.230
I'm managing.

13:40.230 --> 13:44.370
My mom saw a commercial for one
of those Christian dating sites.

13:44.370 --> 13:47.200
She thinks it's time
for me to move on.

13:47.210 --> 13:49.240
Widow with
a high school education

13:49.240 --> 13:53.180
looking for a man
who works with pigs.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.580
She doesn't understand.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.450
Paul's high school
football Jersey...

13:58.450 --> 14:01.450
The one he was wearing
the night he died...

14:01.450 --> 14:04.220
I keep it beside my bed.

14:04.220 --> 14:07.190
Can't bring myself
to get rid of it.

14:07.190 --> 14:10.530
- You shouldn't
feel guilty, Gail.

14:10.530 --> 14:13.230
- Neither should you.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.570
I received your Christmas cards.
I meant to write back, but...

14:22.440 --> 14:24.980
- something's come up.
It may not be anything,

14:24.980 --> 14:28.410
but we're investigating Beckett.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.950
- I thought you couldn't,
legally.

14:29.950 --> 14:32.380
- It's on another matter.

14:32.380 --> 14:35.350
- He burned down another farm?
- Not quite.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.220
I know it's a long shot,

14:37.220 --> 14:40.320
but do you remember
Paul ever mentioning

14:40.330 --> 14:43.260
a police officer named Ted Cody?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.360
- But I could.

14:46.370 --> 14:48.470
I'd say anything.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.400
I'm sorry.

14:55.010 --> 14:57.240
That man should be in prison.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.760
- Can I ask you something?

15:11.760 --> 15:13.990
- Sorry.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.960
What?

15:15.960 --> 15:18.530
- The verdict in the arson case.

15:18.530 --> 15:21.270
What went wrong?

15:21.270 --> 15:25.270
- Um, I had the facts
on my side.

15:25.270 --> 15:28.940
I had the law on my side,
but I still lost.

15:28.940 --> 15:30.740
- Nobody bats a thousand.

15:30.740 --> 15:34.710
- No, it's not that, i...

15:34.710 --> 15:37.310
My dad was an Ada back east.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.650
- I know who your dad is.

15:38.650 --> 15:40.280
- He use to love
coming to my games

15:40.290 --> 15:41.950
when his trial schedule
allowed it.

15:41.950 --> 15:44.790
He sat in the same seat.

15:46.060 --> 15:48.460
It was my senior year.
City playoffs.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.530
And he canceled everything.
Promised he'd be at every game.

15:50.530 --> 15:52.660
And there he was,
sitting in that same seat.

15:52.670 --> 15:55.430
And we made it to the finals.

15:55.430 --> 15:57.370
I'm on the mound,
it's the bottom of the 6th.

15:57.370 --> 16:01.000
I look up in the stands...

16:01.010 --> 16:03.770
And his seat's empty.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.780
I didn't see him for three days.

16:05.780 --> 16:07.440
Sure, he called.
But I didn't answer.

16:07.450 --> 16:10.450
Screw him, right?

16:10.450 --> 16:13.050
Turns out he caught a homicide.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.420
A ten-year-old girl.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.720
When he finally got home,
he said to me,

16:17.720 --> 16:19.420
"someday, you'll meet someone
who's lost

16:19.430 --> 16:21.730
"the most important thing
in his or her life.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.500
"And if you don't do something
to ease their pain,

16:25.500 --> 16:29.000
then what good are you?"

16:29.000 --> 16:30.530
- Mrs. Marcus.

16:35.110 --> 16:37.070
Laura.
- Color me shocked.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.610
- What do you got?
- They found the knife.

16:39.610 --> 16:42.410
- Who?
- A local cop. Officer jonesy.

16:42.410 --> 16:45.480
He went dumpster diving
and struck gold.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.720
- Prints?
- Four point match

16:47.720 --> 16:49.620
to Mr. John Beckett.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.490
- Ah.

16:52.490 --> 16:54.490
Arrest the bastard.

16:56.490 --> 16:57.890
Hm.

17:06.740 --> 17:09.140
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, what the hell?

17:09.140 --> 17:11.740
- I saved the nice
porterhouse for you.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.109
Mr. Tyler's gonna love it.
Terry, wrap that one up.

17:14.109 --> 17:15.780
- John Beckett,
you're under arrest.

17:15.780 --> 17:17.849
I've been waiting
a long time to say that.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.780
- For what?
- Does the murder of Ted Cody

17:19.790 --> 17:21.819
ring a bell?
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

17:21.819 --> 17:24.819
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

17:24.819 --> 17:25.819
in a court of law.
- Oh!

17:25.819 --> 17:31.760
These rights I just read to you?

17:37.100 --> 17:39.170
- You're grinning
like a twice-shot fox.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.840
- What's that supposed to mean?

17:40.840 --> 17:43.070
- All I know is my old man
said it just before

17:43.080 --> 17:46.010
he smacked the smile
off my face.

17:46.010 --> 17:48.710
- Peter.
- What is it?

17:48.710 --> 17:52.480
- Beckett's attorney filed
a motion to exclude the knife.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.190
- And thus, the smack.

17:56.190 --> 17:58.860
- I found the knife in a
dumpster on Radcliffe and main,

17:58.860 --> 18:02.060
about a quarter mile
from the motel.

18:02.060 --> 18:04.090
I... I ended up
in waist-high trash

18:04.100 --> 18:06.060
before I found it.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.800
- I'll show you what
has been marked as

18:07.800 --> 18:09.200
people's 5.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.470
Do you recognize it?
- Sure.

18:11.470 --> 18:14.440
That's the inventory sheet
for the knife.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.940
- What time does it say
you found the knife?

18:16.940 --> 18:18.210
8:05 A.M.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.510
- What time does it say
you logged it in?

18:20.510 --> 18:23.080
- 9:21.
- I'll offer this:

18:23.080 --> 18:26.450
It's an official record
from the city of lemont.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.050
Department of sanitation,
to be precise.

18:29.050 --> 18:33.160
It's for the day officer jonesy
found the knife in question.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.860
- Any objections, Mr. stone?

18:34.860 --> 18:37.460
- Uh, none for the purpose
of this hearing.

18:37.460 --> 18:39.530
- The department
tracks its trucks.

18:39.530 --> 18:41.830
It knows exactly
where every truck is

18:41.830 --> 18:44.500
at every minute of the day.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.870
Please look at the column
for truck number four.

18:47.870 --> 18:52.480
When was it on the corner
of Radcliffe and main?

18:52.480 --> 18:54.110
7:17 A.M.

18:54.110 --> 18:58.220
- Picked up at 7:17.
That's almost 45 minutes

18:58.220 --> 19:01.820
before you combed through
that waist-high trash

19:01.820 --> 19:05.520
where you found the knife
in that very dumpster.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.260
Now, who's lying,
officer jonesy?

19:07.260 --> 19:10.760
You or the computer
at the department of sanitation?

19:10.760 --> 19:12.060
- I looked through
six dumpsters.

19:12.060 --> 19:14.060
- Answer the question, officer.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.900
- Me.

19:25.080 --> 19:30.010
- Now what time did you really
find the knife?

19:30.020 --> 19:32.150
- About two in the morning.

19:32.150 --> 19:35.290
2:00 A.M. until 9:21 A.M.

19:35.290 --> 19:37.920
That's almost 7 1/2 hours.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.920
Plenty of time to corrupt
the evidence.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.260
- Objection.
- Sustained.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.590
- Are you aware that by
knowingly signing

19:43.600 --> 19:46.530
a false inventory sheet,
you are both

19:46.530 --> 19:51.070
tampering with evidence
and obstructing justice?

19:51.070 --> 19:52.970
Do you have a lawyer,
officer jonesy?

19:52.970 --> 19:54.200
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

19:54.210 --> 19:55.940
I have nothing more.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.960
- During the time in question,

20:11.960 --> 20:13.320
where was the knife?

20:13.330 --> 20:16.330
- In my car.
In the trunk of my car.

20:16.330 --> 20:19.260
- Was it in an evidence bag?
- Yes.

20:22.630 --> 20:26.100
- Was the car in your garage?

20:29.940 --> 20:32.810
- It was parked on the street
in front of my ex-wife's place.

20:32.810 --> 20:34.340
I slept there on the couch.
It was supposed to be

20:34.350 --> 20:37.610
my night with my kid,
but i... because I was working,

20:37.620 --> 20:41.820
and I just wanted to see him
before he went to school.

20:41.820 --> 20:46.360
But I did find the knife
in that dumpster.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.220
- No further questions.

20:48.230 --> 20:51.330
- In light of the witness's
admitted perjury

20:51.330 --> 20:55.000
and failure to prove
a valid chain of evidence,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.370
I move the knife
to be excluded from evidence.

20:59.370 --> 21:01.370
- Defense motion is granted.

21:01.370 --> 21:04.270
The knife is
inadmissible at trial.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

21:19.390 --> 21:21.860
- Your shop told me
you were here.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.260
- What the hell? My guest
won't be here for a few.

21:24.260 --> 21:25.330
What can I get you?

21:25.330 --> 21:27.100
- No, I'm good.

21:30.330 --> 21:34.070
- So, what? Are we supposed to
talk like we're old pals?

21:34.070 --> 21:37.070
- Why not?
We're both grown ups.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.910
- Hope there are
no hard feelings.

21:39.910 --> 21:42.050
You know what, stone?
You may not see it this way now,

21:42.050 --> 21:43.280
because you're fresh off
the fire,

21:43.280 --> 21:46.280
but this is a win
for the little guy.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.020
I mean, just look at
what they call the case:

21:48.020 --> 21:52.290
The people of the state of
Illinois versus Beckett, John p.

21:52.290 --> 21:56.030
I mean, the deck is kinda
stacked, isn't it?

21:56.030 --> 22:00.130
That's almost 13 million people
against one butcher.

22:00.130 --> 22:04.200
- Who killed two of them.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.970
- Whatever happened to bygones?

22:05.970 --> 22:08.740
- They don't exist for me.
It's my special problem.

22:08.740 --> 22:11.240
- Well, I recommend tums
for the agita.

22:11.240 --> 22:14.310
- It's more like
a Thorn in my paw.

22:14.310 --> 22:17.250
The further I walk, the deeper
it goes, the more it hurts.

22:20.450 --> 22:22.450
- You wanna know what I think?

22:22.450 --> 22:24.750
I think this is it for you.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.390
Trying to put the bad guys away
day after day.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.430
The thing is, one morning,
you're gonna wake up,

22:30.430 --> 22:33.200
shave, brush your teeth,
look at yourself in the mirror

22:33.200 --> 22:38.970
and realize you're the one
in the cage.

22:38.970 --> 22:41.400
- But here I am.

22:50.950 --> 22:55.490
- Is there any chance
he didn't do it?

22:55.490 --> 22:57.020
- No.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.320
- What you know won't pay for
this cup of coffee.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.420
It's what you can prove
in court that counts.

23:01.430 --> 23:02.990
- And without the knife,
all I can prove

23:02.990 --> 23:05.900
is they had drinks together.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.060
- Why?

23:08.070 --> 23:11.170
- What?
- Why did Beckett kill Cody?

23:11.170 --> 23:13.900
- You know, technically, motive
isn't an element of murder.

23:13.910 --> 23:16.340
- Well, it's part of
a good narrative.

23:16.340 --> 23:19.940
Did you ever think that Beckett
beat you on the arson case

23:19.950 --> 23:22.950
because he just told
a better story?

23:22.950 --> 23:24.850
- An insurance scam?
- No.

23:24.850 --> 23:30.190
A hard-working business man
being swallowed by debt.

23:30.190 --> 23:31.990
Juries can relate
to that, Peter.

23:31.990 --> 23:35.760
- So they ignore a murder?

23:35.760 --> 23:38.960
- Juries love a good story.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.500
Tell 'em one.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.200
- There's nothing
in Cody's email

23:46.200 --> 23:47.900
that suggests
he even knew Beckett.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.070
- We know they knew each other.

23:49.070 --> 23:50.440
- Well, they sure tried
to hide it.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.980
- Find out why.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.840
- There is something
that's not here.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.110
According to the motel manager,
Cody booked the room online.

23:56.110 --> 23:59.120
Thing is, he never received
a confirmation email.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.120
- Someone must have.
Find it.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.850
- He booked through
hotels-r-u,

24:04.860 --> 24:06.990
under someone else's
email address.

24:06.990 --> 24:09.960
Jrudkus@ugtmail.Com.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.530
- Fake credit card?
- Nope.

24:11.530 --> 24:14.030
Cody's credit card,
correct billing information.

24:14.030 --> 24:17.230
Now, if there's an ip address...

24:17.240 --> 24:20.900
Ah, got it.

24:20.910 --> 24:23.540
Looks like it was sent
to an Internet café.

24:23.540 --> 24:28.080
- Jrudkus@ugtmail.Com.
- As in jurgis rudkus?

24:28.080 --> 24:30.010
- Who?
- Upton sinclair, "the jungle."

24:30.020 --> 24:32.880
Rudkus worked in
a meat packing plant.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.950
- Anyway, Cody's motel receipt
was sent to that address.

24:35.950 --> 24:37.890
What?

24:37.890 --> 24:39.890
- Beckett probably
didn't finish the book.

24:39.890 --> 24:42.890
- Why do you say that?
- Because rudkus goes to prison.

24:42.890 --> 24:45.430
- Peter, this was just
hand-delivered.

24:45.430 --> 24:47.000
- Thanks.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.940
"No hard feelings.
John Beckett"

24:51.940 --> 24:54.170
- mm. I'd send them back.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.850
When did Cody start
getting extra cash?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.880
- His ex-wife said
back in the summer of 2012.

25:06.890 --> 25:09.590
- Right after the arson trial.

25:09.590 --> 25:11.990
- A payoff.
- Was there anything unusual

25:11.990 --> 25:14.020
about Cody's spending?

25:14.030 --> 25:18.030
- Rent, water and electric,
1,200 a month to his ex.

25:18.030 --> 25:19.930
- Any big transactions?

25:19.930 --> 25:21.560
- There was a single large
cash deposit.

25:21.570 --> 25:24.470
$30,000 to his son's
college savings account.

25:24.470 --> 25:26.940
- Well, that's nowhere near
enough for four years at an Ivy.

25:26.940 --> 25:29.070
Even with the 40,000 cash
in his freezer.

25:29.070 --> 25:32.610
- That's not enough for
four years at a state school.

25:32.610 --> 25:35.040
- Cody was blackmailing Beckett.

25:35.050 --> 25:37.880
First meat, then cash, then Cody
put his hand out for more

25:37.880 --> 25:39.950
and Beckett cut it off.
- We can't prove that.

25:39.950 --> 25:41.280
- Yes, but it's a narrative.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.550
Let's get it in front
of a grand jury.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.220
- You know what I remember?

25:47.230 --> 25:50.030
That smug smile when the jury
came back not guilty.

25:50.030 --> 25:51.960
- I did everything I could
not to look at him.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.960
- Mm.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.600
- A grand jury subpoena?

25:56.600 --> 25:57.630
You gotta be kidding me.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.140
- I thought we were pals, stone.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.200
If you want something, just ask.

26:01.210 --> 26:02.940
- It's all in a flash drive.

26:02.940 --> 26:05.640
Mr. Beckett's bank statements
and financials...

26:05.640 --> 26:08.540
Both business and personal...
For the last ten years.

26:08.550 --> 26:11.050
- You know what?
That's the last time

26:11.050 --> 26:14.520
I have a drink
with a dying friend.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.150
- Oh, uh, Mr. Beckett,
I almost forgot

26:16.150 --> 26:18.120
to thank you for the steaks.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.020
I'm sure my neighbor's dog's
gonna love them.

26:26.930 --> 26:28.300
- I should've gone
to butcher school.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.970
Beckett's got this,
an sl and a range rover.

26:30.970 --> 26:33.140
- Who knew there was
such a thing as boat tax?

26:33.140 --> 26:36.540
- This isn't a boat.
It's a beneteau.

26:36.540 --> 26:37.970
Kingpins love them some boat.

26:37.980 --> 26:41.040
- Hey, you find anything?
- If you're gonna

26:41.050 --> 26:43.280
seize Beckett's assets,
start with this.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.950
- Aw, it's too late.
He stopped paying taxes on it.

26:45.950 --> 26:48.120
He must have sold it.
- When?

26:48.120 --> 26:49.990
- Uh, five years ago.

26:49.990 --> 26:51.350
- He probably needed
the money to pay his lawyer.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.990
- Oh, and the only big deposit
made back then

26:54.990 --> 26:57.730
was for 50 grand in April.
- Huh.

26:57.730 --> 26:59.330
All yachts need to be registered

26:59.330 --> 27:01.030
with the department
of natural resources.

27:01.030 --> 27:04.030
Find out who bought
Beckett's boat.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.600
- I gotta say, Ms. caufield,

27:05.600 --> 27:08.040
you don't seem like
the kind to buy a boat.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.310
- Nothing brings me peace
like a day on the lake.

27:10.310 --> 27:11.570
- I agree.

27:11.580 --> 27:14.040
Have we... have we met?

27:14.050 --> 27:16.750
- Not that I know of.

27:16.750 --> 27:20.650
- Actually, we're looking
into John Beckett,

27:20.650 --> 27:22.250
the man who sold you the boat.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.250
- He seemed nice enough.
- I'd say so.

27:24.260 --> 27:29.290
He sold you a $500,000 boat
for 50,000.

27:29.290 --> 27:33.300
Please don't tell me
it was a fixer-upper.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.770
- You know what?
I'd like to see it.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.070
You sold it.

27:41.070 --> 27:43.070
And I bet as quickly
as possible.

27:43.070 --> 27:44.340
The boat was a payoff.

27:44.340 --> 27:45.740
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:45.740 --> 27:49.050
- Sure you do.
And we have met before.

27:49.050 --> 27:52.350
You were a juror
in John Beckett's arson trial.

27:52.350 --> 27:55.050
He paid you to fix
the outcome of his trial.

27:58.620 --> 28:00.360
- Am I going to jail?
- No, the question

28:00.360 --> 28:02.060
isn't will you go to jail,
Ms. caufield.

28:02.060 --> 28:04.090
It's for how long.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.100
- A man was murdered.
You helped his killer go free.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.800
- People like you...
You'll never know.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.300
- The farmer, Paul Marcus...
- Was dead already.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.740
The landlord tripled
my rent here.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.310
There's no way I could
stay in business.

28:17.310 --> 28:19.680
I needed help.

28:19.680 --> 28:23.810
A man knocks at my door
and says he can save my life.

28:23.820 --> 28:25.050
- Who?

28:27.650 --> 28:29.790
- At a minimum,
Cody was Beckett's bag man.

28:29.790 --> 28:32.690
He delivered 50 grand in cash
to Vanessa caufield.

28:32.690 --> 28:33.790
She used the money to buy.

28:33.790 --> 28:35.730
Beckett's $1/2 million boat.

28:35.730 --> 28:37.360
- Nice work if you can get it.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.100
- All she had to do
was vote for an acquittal.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.430
- Why wasn't there a hung jury?

28:41.430 --> 28:43.200
- She went above and beyond.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.130
With two other hold outs,
she convinced nine jurors

28:45.140 --> 28:47.200
to let a guilty man walk.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.310
- We think Beckett got tired
of paying Cody.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.410
- Well, you've got the beginning

28:51.410 --> 28:54.480
of a good narrative
on the Cody murder.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.850
Now all we need
is some evidence.

28:58.850 --> 29:01.450
- I'm going after
Beckett for arson.

29:01.450 --> 29:03.750
And the murder of Paul Marcus.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.090
- In what country?
In this one,

29:06.090 --> 29:08.760
the state's only allowed
one bite at the apple.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.330
- Well, not necessarily.

29:11.330 --> 29:14.100
- Excuse me, did someone
rewrite the fifth amendment

29:14.100 --> 29:19.100
- I have to admit, Mr. stone,
I am a little baffled, myself.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.800
- The rule against double
jeopardy only applies,

29:20.810 --> 29:23.510
and I quote,
"once jeopardy has attached."

29:23.510 --> 29:26.340
- And it attaches once the jury
has been empanelled and sworn.

29:26.340 --> 29:28.110
- Only, in the aleman case,

29:28.110 --> 29:29.450
the appellate court held
that when a trial judge

29:29.450 --> 29:32.320
takes a bribe, the defendant
was never in jeopardy.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.180
So the rule wasn't violated
and the people could retry him.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.790
- There's a big difference
between one judge and 12 jurors.

29:37.790 --> 29:40.160
- Don't you mean 11 jurors?

29:41.860 --> 29:44.190
I have Vanessa caufield's
grand jury testimony,

29:44.200 --> 29:46.260
in which she swears
that Mr. Beckett paid her

29:46.260 --> 29:49.330
what amounts to $450,000
to ensure that she would

29:49.330 --> 29:51.270
only vote for an acquittal.

29:51.270 --> 29:54.270
Ergo, Mr. Beckett was never
really in jeopardy.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.910
That trial,
for all intents and purposes,

29:55.910 --> 29:59.180
never happened.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.540
- Very clever, Mr. stone.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.180
- I hope there's a "but" coming.

30:03.180 --> 30:04.410
- Sorry, counsel.

30:04.420 --> 30:08.780
But the trial of Mr. Beckett
for arson and felony murder

30:08.790 --> 30:11.290
of Paul Marcus will proceed.

30:11.290 --> 30:13.520
- Thank you, your honor.

30:13.530 --> 30:15.860
It's getting crowded
in that cage.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.570
- From the burn patterns,
we determined

30:23.570 --> 30:26.540
that the fire originated
in a back room of the warehouse,

30:26.540 --> 30:29.440
with the help of an accelerant.
- Which was?

30:29.440 --> 30:31.410
- Gasoline.

30:31.410 --> 30:33.880
Based upon construction of
the warehouse and the fire load,

30:33.880 --> 30:36.480
we determined that the fire was
burning for at least 30 minutes

30:36.480 --> 30:38.710
when Mr. Beckett called 911.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.680
- Did you find that odd?
- Yes.

30:40.690 --> 30:42.620
His residence
was on the property,

30:42.620 --> 30:44.890
less than 100 yards
from the warehouse.

30:44.890 --> 30:46.760
Dozens of pigs burned to death.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.390
There's no way someone
in the house couldn't smell it.

30:49.390 --> 30:52.500
- Hm.
Tell us about Paul Marcus.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.460
- He was an employee
of Mr. Beckett.

30:54.470 --> 30:57.600
Apparently, he was asleep in the
warehouse when the fire started.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.840
He died from smoke inhalation.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.570
No further questions.

31:06.410 --> 31:08.840
- In the first trial,
you testified

31:08.850 --> 31:10.710
that it was possible

31:10.720 --> 31:13.720
this fire was caused
by an electrical short.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.590
Didn't you?
- I said it was possible,

31:16.590 --> 31:18.520
but we found gas dispersion
in places

31:18.520 --> 31:20.460
where gas wasn't supposed to be.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.790
- But it was possible.
- When I said that,

31:22.790 --> 31:26.630
I meant that...
- yes or no?

31:26.630 --> 31:29.600
- Sure.
- Thank you.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.430
- When we initially
questioned Mr. Beckett,

31:31.440 --> 31:33.640
I smelled gasoline
on his person.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.840
- He said he spilled the gas
while he was filling up his car.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.510
So we checked
the surveillance cameras

31:39.510 --> 31:42.510
at the gas station
he said he went to that day

31:42.510 --> 31:44.510
and neither he nor his car
were ever there.

31:44.520 --> 31:48.680
- After the fire marshal
told us he suspected arson,

31:48.690 --> 31:50.520
we checked
Mr. Beckett's financials

31:50.520 --> 31:52.820
and we learned that he was
in financial trouble.

31:52.820 --> 31:54.820
- Could you please
be more specific?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.690
- He owed nearly $2 million.

31:56.690 --> 31:58.260
Finally, we learned
that his property

31:58.260 --> 31:59.800
was insured for $3 million.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.630
That's when we arrested him.

32:01.630 --> 32:07.570
- Thank you.

32:07.570 --> 32:10.440
- How many gas stations
were there within ten miles

32:10.440 --> 32:13.280
of Mr. Beckett's property?

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
- Three or four.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.850
- There were five, actually.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.710
Did you check
the surveillance cameras

32:17.720 --> 32:19.880
at the other four gas stations
close by?

32:19.880 --> 32:22.590
- No. We checked the one
he said he used.

32:22.590 --> 32:26.490
- Mr. Beckett's property
just burned down.

32:26.490 --> 32:30.830
His business... everything he
owned... got destroyed.

32:30.830 --> 32:32.730
Now is it possible
that he made a mistake

32:32.730 --> 32:36.600
when he told you
what gas station he used?

32:36.600 --> 32:38.000
- Yeah, I guess.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.640
- In your experience,
is it rare for a business

32:40.640 --> 32:43.770
to insure itself against fire?

32:43.780 --> 32:46.810
- No.
- Thank you.

32:48.580 --> 32:51.850
- Paul and I were married
for 13 years.

32:51.850 --> 32:54.080
He loved working with pigs.

32:54.090 --> 32:55.950
Ever since summers
in high school.

32:55.950 --> 33:00.760
I never understood it,
but Mr. Beckett paid him okay.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.760
- How long did he work
for Mr. Beckett?

33:02.760 --> 33:04.530
- Since he opened the farm.

33:04.530 --> 33:07.630
Maybe three years.

33:07.630 --> 33:10.870
- I know this is difficult,
Mrs. Marcus,

33:10.870 --> 33:15.770
but please tell us
about the night Paul died.

33:15.770 --> 33:18.670
- We had a fight...
Like all married people...

33:18.680 --> 33:20.740
About something stupid.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.910
- Do you remember
what you fought about?

33:22.910 --> 33:26.550
- He went bowling after work
with his friend Mel,

33:26.550 --> 33:30.120
and we were supposed to
have dinner at my mom's.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.890
That he wasn't going to
sleep in my bed that night.

33:34.890 --> 33:37.090
He grabbed a six pack
and he left.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.530
He was huffy like that.

33:41.530 --> 33:45.530
He slept in Mr. Beckett's barn.
He had a key.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.940
The next morning,
there was a cop at my door

33:47.940 --> 33:52.040
telling me that my husband
had died in a fire.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.880
- I'm sorry.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.580
- I don't even know
where our son is.

34:00.590 --> 34:03.990
He just left because
he blamed me for his dad dying.

34:03.990 --> 34:06.390
And now...

34:06.390 --> 34:07.990
I'm just alone.

34:14.800 --> 34:19.570
Three lives ruined, Mr. Beckett.
Was it worth it?

34:19.570 --> 34:21.100
- Objection.
- No further questions.

34:21.110 --> 34:22.840
- I have no questions.

34:27.909 --> 34:31.679
- All I ever wanted was
a business of my own, you know?

34:31.679 --> 34:35.120
- Was there a problem?
- Not at first.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.590
I took out a loan
to lease some land

34:37.590 --> 34:41.120
and build a small farm and
warehouse to package fresh meat.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.190
Within a couple of months,
the county was up my ass

34:43.190 --> 34:46.199
about fixing a pot hole
in the driveway.

34:46.199 --> 34:49.600
And there was a fine
attached to that, of course.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.600
Then the fda shows up.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.139
They say that my packing
was mislabeled

34:54.139 --> 34:57.840
because even though
my chickens are cage-free,

34:57.840 --> 35:00.140
they're not cage-free
according to the government.

35:00.140 --> 35:04.210
Why? Because there's
an irrigation pipe 25 feet below

35:04.220 --> 35:06.450
and an opening in the dirt.

35:06.450 --> 35:08.120
And that was another fine.

35:08.120 --> 35:12.720
Then there was the epa
for cow flatulation.

35:12.720 --> 35:17.060
They say that the design
of my livestock waste lagoon

35:17.060 --> 35:18.230
was a half an inch shallow.

35:18.230 --> 35:20.060
They said I would have
to build a whole

35:20.060 --> 35:23.700
brand new indoor facility.
- Did you?

35:23.700 --> 35:26.740
- It would've cost
over a million dollars.

35:26.740 --> 35:30.170
The fine's got to be
$20,000 per day.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.970
Who can afford that?

35:31.980 --> 35:34.680
I owed over $2 million.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.780
Maybe I got a little sloppy
or careless

35:36.780 --> 35:39.650
with the electric
in the warehouse.

35:39.650 --> 35:43.220
- What did you do with the
insurance money you received?

35:43.220 --> 35:46.120
- I paid off
the damn government.

35:49.190 --> 35:54.030
I am sorry about
what happened to Paul.

35:54.030 --> 35:56.800
And I feel for Gail.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.270
But there is just no way in hell

35:58.270 --> 36:00.000
I'd burn down my own farm.

36:06.510 --> 36:08.980
- I feel for you, Mr. Beckett.

36:08.980 --> 36:13.020
Perhaps you consoled yourself
on your 41-foot yacht.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.120
- Okay, that was stupid.
I admit it.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.190
But I was working hard,
I thought I'd treat myself.

36:21.190 --> 36:23.830
- To a $500,000 boat.

36:23.830 --> 36:26.900
- I had a loan.
It's the American way, right?

36:26.900 --> 36:29.230
- So you also used
your insurance money

36:29.230 --> 36:31.070
to pay off your boat loan.

36:31.070 --> 36:32.200
- And what's wrong with that?

36:32.200 --> 36:33.840
- Nothing.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.770
Until you sold
the $1/2 million boat

36:35.770 --> 36:39.110
to a juror to fix
your arson case.

36:39.110 --> 36:41.240
- I didn't know what to do.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.910
I didn't do anything wrong
and the next thing I know,

36:43.920 --> 36:46.280
I'm on trial for murder.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.950
You know, all of you...
The cops, the firemen,

36:48.950 --> 36:51.120
the whole damn government,
and you, Mr. stone...

36:51.120 --> 36:54.260
You can't let a decent man run
his business and live his life.

36:54.260 --> 36:56.330
- A decent man wouldn't
kill an employee in a fire

36:56.330 --> 36:59.230
he started for money.
- Is there a question?

36:59.230 --> 37:02.060
- Ask the cop.
Yeah, maybe he smelled gasoline.

37:02.070 --> 37:05.170
But you ask him about the burns
on my clothes and my hands.

37:05.170 --> 37:08.240
- Are you saying
you tried to save Paul Marcus?

37:08.240 --> 37:11.170
- I already said I didn't know
he was in the warehouse.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.280
I tried to save the pigs.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.880
The fire was everywhere and
I was trying to get them out.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.150
But they were out of
their minds, screaming.

37:19.150 --> 37:21.250
Have you ever heard
a pig scream?

37:21.250 --> 37:25.020
You can't just open a gate and
let them run out like horses.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.160
You gotta grab 'em
by the back legs.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.860
And they're 200 pounds.

37:35.300 --> 37:38.800
- Mr. stone?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.600
Sorry, judge.

37:40.610 --> 37:43.270
Uh...

37:43.270 --> 37:48.280
You grab the pigs by the...

37:48.280 --> 37:50.250
Grab the pigs by the back legs
and then what?

37:50.250 --> 37:53.220
- Do you know what it takes
to wrangle a pig?

37:53.220 --> 37:55.880
You gotta put your knee
in their back and grab an ear

37:55.890 --> 37:59.320
and then maybe... maybe
they'll do what you want.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.220
- Nothing further.

38:04.030 --> 38:07.300
- That's it for today.

38:07.300 --> 38:10.200
- You wanna talk? Hm?

38:10.200 --> 38:12.030
- I'll listen.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.980
- Why is she here?
- I invited her.

38:20.980 --> 38:22.180
If you're uncomfortable,
we can wait to hear

38:22.180 --> 38:24.980
what the jury decides.
- No, that's fine.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.250
Okay, the way I see it,
we pretty much

38:27.250 --> 38:29.850
fought this to a draw.
- I see it differently.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.220
- All you've got
is bribing a juror.

38:32.220 --> 38:35.220
Was pretty convincing.
- You know what?

38:35.230 --> 38:38.030
I'll roll the dice.
I'll take my chances.

38:38.030 --> 38:39.290
- That's fine with me.

38:39.300 --> 38:43.100
We'll worry about
the other charges later.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.830
- What's he talking about?

38:44.840 --> 38:46.300
- Murdering Ted Cody.

38:46.300 --> 38:49.070
- The knife was excluded.
You have no evidence.

38:49.070 --> 38:51.110
- Well, maybe,
but I've got a narrative.

38:51.110 --> 38:56.680
Cody was blackmailing
your client for bribing a juror.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.280
He decided he didn't want
to pay anymore.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.120
- You can't prove anything.

39:00.120 --> 39:04.120
What you're looking at are
pictures of Ted Cody's injuries.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.220
There's the bruised ankles
and the broad bruising

39:06.220 --> 39:08.990
on his back and neck,
which was, of course, broken.

39:08.990 --> 39:10.930
Let's not forget
the torn earlobe.

39:12.230 --> 39:16.030
You wrangled Ted Cody
just like you wrangled pigs.

39:16.030 --> 39:19.000
Add to that the free meat,
the cash in Cody's freezer,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Ms. caufield's testimony,
and the fact that

39:21.010 --> 39:22.270
you're pretty much
a low-life in general,

39:22.270 --> 39:25.240
and I've got one hell
of a story for the jury.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.340
Oh, and I'll make sure that
your sentences run consecutively

39:28.350 --> 39:32.210
so you'll be out
when you're 130.

39:32.220 --> 39:35.220
- Last meat on the bone, huh?
That's what you want.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.950
- I could be happy
with you in stateville

39:36.950 --> 39:40.320
for the next 35 years.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.290
Which is a bargain,
considering the minimum

39:42.290 --> 39:45.130
for two murders is natural life.

39:55.310 --> 39:59.040
- Yeah, right. Okay.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.310
What the hell?

40:00.310 --> 40:02.240
- I wanna hear you say
you killed Ted Cody.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.450
- He was a dirty cop.
- Clock's ticking.

40:09.020 --> 40:11.320
No deal.

40:11.320 --> 40:15.160
- Yeah, okay.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.260
Sure.

40:17.260 --> 40:19.060
I killed him.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.530
- And Paul Marcus.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.210
- I killed Paul Marcus.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.320
Shame on you!

41:07.040 --> 41:09.380
- All I can say is I'm glad
I don't eat meat.

41:09.380 --> 41:11.010
- Guess it's true what they say.

41:11.020 --> 41:12.480
Never ask how
the sausage is made.

41:15.820 --> 41:18.350
- For a minute,
I felt for Beckett.

41:18.360 --> 41:21.820
I mean, all those regulations,
he was suffocating.

41:21.830 --> 41:26.260
- We get the government
we deserve, Anna.

41:26.260 --> 41:28.330
- It's for you from Gail Marcus.

41:40.010 --> 41:44.310
What's that?

41:44.320 --> 41:47.350
It's the reason I do what I do.

41:47.350 --> 41:49.220
- Drink up while you can, folks.

41:49.220 --> 41:51.290
'Cause starting tomorrow,
I'm shut down for four days

41:51.290 --> 41:54.360
to fix some problem that
the health inspector found.

42:04.030 --> 42:06.640
- Got 'im.
- Yeah, we did.
