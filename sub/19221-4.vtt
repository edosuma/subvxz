WEBVTT

00:03.502 --> 00:04.702
There you go, Billy.

00:04.704 --> 00:06.404
Enjoy those Boston creams.

00:06.406 --> 00:07.671
And no judgments.

00:07.673 --> 00:08.906
Everyone deserves a cheat day.

00:08.908 --> 00:10.174
Yeah.

00:11.176 --> 00:13.277
Wow. Look at all this cash, huh?

00:13.279 --> 00:14.846
Boy, business has been great
the last two weeks.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.047
I wonder what's going on?

00:16.049 --> 00:17.715
Hmm. You think it was the addition

00:17.717 --> 00:19.584
of a certain enterprising employee

00:19.586 --> 00:21.419
that's taken the donut world by storm?

00:21.421 --> 00:24.288
Nah. I'm thinking it's, uh,

00:24.290 --> 00:26.991
Billy's nine consecutive cheat days.

00:26.993 --> 00:29.961
Oh. I'm gonna be late for class.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.597
- You going back to school, Tush?
- Yep.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.465
When you're a self-employed
Renaissance man

00:34.467 --> 00:37.235
like myself, you've always got
to be expanding your skill set,

00:37.237 --> 00:40.138
- so I'm learning to draw caricatures.
- Dope.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.506
A fellow artist.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.574
I'm hoping to get a gig
down at Navy Pier.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.910
You see, caricature artists
are kind of like the rock stars

00:45.912 --> 00:47.745
of the street performer community.

00:47.747 --> 00:50.047
They get way more tail
than bucket drummers.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.616
Oh, right, yeah.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.017
Let me see them.

00:53.019 --> 00:54.385
Oh, there you go.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.420
Oh, is that you?

00:56.422 --> 00:58.823
- And are those bees?
- Yeah.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.726
First rule of caricature:
give the people a hobby.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.427
And I'm a beekeeper.

01:03.429 --> 01:06.697
At least I was, until my wife
got the queen in the divorce,

01:06.699 --> 01:10.301
- and all the bees followed her home.
- Oh.

01:10.303 --> 01:13.804
- I bet that really stung.
- Hey.

01:13.806 --> 01:15.773
- Too soon.
- I'm sorry.

01:15.775 --> 01:18.509
- Well, have a great class.
- Thank you.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.912
Tonight we're learning
to draw décolletage,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.314
that's French for "upper boobs."

01:25.318 --> 01:26.784
- Oh, I'm beat.
- Yeah.

01:26.786 --> 01:28.219
Last thing I want to
do is walk six blocks

01:28.221 --> 01:30.354
to the bank and make this deposit.

01:30.356 --> 01:31.622
Well, I can do it for you.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.823
Uh, no. No, that's okay.

01:32.825 --> 01:34.358
I don't want to put you out.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.194
No, it's cool. I walk by your
bank on my way home.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.918
- No. I got it.
- Seriously, I don't mind.

01:38.943 --> 01:40.965
- It's windy as hell out there.
- No. It's all right.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.968
My doctor says I'm not
getting enough wind.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.204
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.805
You don't trust me, do you?

01:47.807 --> 01:49.173
No, no, no.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.609
I-I don't.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.678
Wow. All right.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.513
No, no, no, no.
Don't take it personally.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.081
I mean, you just started two weeks ago.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.482
I hardly know you.

01:58.484 --> 01:59.517
What are you talking about?

01:59.519 --> 02:00.818
I told you everything about myself.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.653
My hopes, my dreams...

02:02.655 --> 02:04.854
- even that time my dad threw me out.
- Maybe it's because

02:04.879 --> 02:07.592
you wouldn't shut up
about your hopes and dreams.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.926
Seriously, why don't you trust
me, hmm? 'Cause I'm young?

02:09.929 --> 02:12.563
'Cause I smoke weed?
'Cause I've done graffiti?

02:12.565 --> 02:13.831
'Cause I smoke weed?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.099
You already said that.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.068
Yeah, 'cause I smoke weed.

02:23.041 --> 02:24.308
You forgot that.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.611
I know, 'cause I smoke weed.

02:28.676 --> 02:33.137

02:37.422 --> 02:40.458
Maya, you are always sitting
here with your nose in a book.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.760
I'm studying, Fawz.
I'm in graduate school.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.463
Interesting. Are you majoring
in wasting Daddy's money

02:45.465 --> 02:48.165
with a minor in never finding a husband?

02:48.167 --> 02:52.270
Don't you have a family-owned
business to foreclose on?

02:52.272 --> 02:54.605
Not for another 45 minutes.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.674
Arthur.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.743
Just thought of another reason
why you should trust me.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.544
- Oh, goodie.
- Okay.

03:00.546 --> 03:02.113
In sixth grade,
they made me hall monitor.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.614
They even gave me a badge.

03:03.616 --> 03:04.749
Of course, the other kids had guns.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.750
I see.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.152
I skipped sixth grade.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.288
I wasn't gifted. I just didn't show up

03:10.290 --> 03:12.123
and no one seemed to notice.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.760
Here's another one: I was
treasurer of the Pokémon club.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.827
Pokémon?

03:16.829 --> 03:18.596
Me, too.

03:18.598 --> 03:19.930
In fourth grade?

03:20.732 --> 03:23.134
Yeah.

03:23.769 --> 03:25.169
Anyway, we had a car wash

03:25.171 --> 03:26.871
and guess who was in charge
of the money?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.073
Well, I don't know the names
of the other kids.

03:29.075 --> 03:32.243
Sort of limits my options.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.411
I really don't get it.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.514
How can you not trust this face?

03:36.516 --> 03:38.916
Yeah, Arthur, why don't you trust me?

03:38.918 --> 03:41.786
You know we were just talking
about this in a class.

03:41.788 --> 03:45.056
I'm taking sociology, slash psychology,
slash gender studies.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.540
Slash my wrists.

03:48.761 --> 03:51.996
I think Arthur's issue
could be a generational one.

03:51.998 --> 03:55.132
Or maybe it's unconscious bias,
or it could be racial.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.802
Can I say it's two out of three
and not say which two?

03:57.804 --> 04:00.438
Now look, I'm just using common sense.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.773
The kid's only been working here
a couple of weeks.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.442
Well, I believe
in the goodness of people,

04:04.444 --> 04:06.344
especially Franco,
who I could tell was special

04:06.346 --> 04:07.545
from the moment I met him.

04:07.547 --> 04:08.846
I remember it was a Monday.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.716
I think he was wearing those same pants.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.584
And have you ever started
a sentence and had no idea

04:13.586 --> 04:15.920
how to bail out of it?
Oh, look, there's my table.

04:17.356 --> 04:19.923
So no one's on my side here?

04:19.926 --> 04:21.024
I am.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.793
As businessmen, we must always

04:22.795 --> 04:24.562
be suspicious of our workers.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.964
You know how Columbian drug
lords make their employees work

04:26.966 --> 04:28.966
in their underwear so they cannot steal?

04:28.968 --> 04:32.269
That is how I run my travel agency.

04:32.271 --> 04:35.039
Maybe I should drop by sometime.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.274
Oh, no. They're not attractive people.

04:38.377 --> 04:41.345
That's not an issue with me.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.247
Well, look, if it's any consolation,

04:43.249 --> 04:45.716
- I trust you... to wash these.
- Okay.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.419
All right, but I'm gonna keep
this up till I win you over.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.521
Oh, joy.

04:50.523 --> 04:54.392
Arthur, I know you
don't like new things.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.093
You won't even use a microwave.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.294
It makes you sterile.

04:57.296 --> 04:59.018
You're 75.

04:59.043 --> 05:01.457
- That makes you sterile.
- Yeah, thank you.

05:02.434 --> 05:05.503
The point is is that Franco is new here,

05:05.505 --> 05:08.205
and you cannot work with someone
if you don't trust them.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.608
Ha!

05:10.610 --> 05:12.576
I said "ha!"

05:13.349 --> 05:14.745
What?

05:14.747 --> 05:17.314
I just think it's really interesting
that you of all people

05:17.316 --> 05:18.549
are talking about trust.

05:18.551 --> 05:22.019
Oh, come on. Get over it.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.588
James threw up the first
time he saw a dead body.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.525
I may have let it slip to
the guys at the station.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.793
May have?

05:28.795 --> 05:30.861
You put it in a group text,
and named the group

05:30.863 --> 05:33.610
"James threw up after
seeing a dead body."

05:34.462 --> 05:36.434
It was a pretty gruesome scene.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.602
A woman attacked her
husband with a lawn mower.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.704
Chopped him into pieces.

05:40.706 --> 05:42.940
The first thing we found was his mouth.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.610
Oh, I'm sorry!

05:46.612 --> 05:48.012
Hey, don't flush.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.682
I want to take a picture for the guys.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.252
Anyway, trust is a beautiful thing.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.887
Yeah, Arthur.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.355
And how do you know if you trust Franco

05:58.357 --> 05:59.990
if you never give him a chance?

05:59.992 --> 06:01.826
All right, look.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.495
If it gets you all off my back,
I'll do it, okay?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.297
Trays are clean.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.398
Hey, listen, kid.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.899
We're gonna close soon,

06:08.901 --> 06:10.701
so why don't you take off
a little early and, uh,

06:10.703 --> 06:13.437
make this deposit for me at the bank?

06:13.439 --> 06:15.606
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:16.775 --> 06:19.109
Now, there's 700 bucks in there,

06:19.111 --> 06:20.344
so go directly to the bank

06:20.346 --> 06:22.346
and put it in the
bank deposit box, okay?

06:22.348 --> 06:24.281
- No pit stops, you understand?
- Yes, sir.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.350
All right. Strip club, taco stand, bank.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.685
What?

06:27.687 --> 06:29.920
You're right. I'll eat at the strip club.

06:29.922 --> 06:30.810
What?

06:30.834 --> 06:32.129
I'm just playing,
nobody eats at the strip club.

06:32.154 --> 06:33.740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

06:33.888 --> 06:35.726
I got this, homie.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.661
The trick is to walk
casual, so nobody knows

06:37.663 --> 06:39.129
you're carrying this much money.

06:39.131 --> 06:40.364
Observe...

06:42.000 --> 06:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:50.809 --> 06:53.344
Where'd Franco get all that money?

06:58.149 --> 07:00.017
Hey, man, my dog ran away.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.185
Can you help me find him?

07:01.187 --> 07:02.219
Yeah, sure, man.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.387
Whoa.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.722
Give me your backpack.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.023
I can't man, listen.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.192
But I'll give you
everything in my wallet.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.295
No. Don't make me use this, man.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.297
- Is that your finger?
- No.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.232
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-mm!

07:15.234 --> 07:16.467
I know that voice.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.236
- Is that you Crackhead Kevin?
- No.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.571
I'm a different crackhead.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.340
You don't know me,
now give me the bag, Franco.

07:23.342 --> 07:24.675
I told you I can't, all right?

07:24.677 --> 07:26.377
So do you want the wallet or not?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.212
Okay, fine.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.785
Damn. You got unexpected
crackhead strength, Kevin!

07:34.787 --> 07:37.221
Don't judge me... you don't know
where my regular strength ends

07:37.223 --> 07:38.756
and my crackhead strength begins.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.700
You called an Uber?

07:52.432 --> 07:54.225
Oh, my God, what happened to you?

07:54.227 --> 07:55.627
I got jumped.

07:55.629 --> 07:57.762
They took my backpack
with all your money it.

07:57.764 --> 07:59.248
And I tried to stop him but
he threw me against this gate...

07:59.273 --> 08:00.332
Try-try not to talk.

08:00.334 --> 08:01.399
Why, am I losing a lot of blood?

08:01.401 --> 08:02.867
No, because it's annoying.

08:02.869 --> 08:04.703
Did you get, did you get
a good look at the guy?

08:04.705 --> 08:06.905
Yeah, it's a dude from the
neighborhood, Crackhead Kevin.

08:06.907 --> 08:11.476
Crackhead Debbie's son? Boy the pipe
doesn't fall far from the tree. Come on.

08:11.478 --> 08:13.478
Is everything okay?
I noticed the lights on

08:13.480 --> 08:15.647
when I was helping
a man in a wheelchair...

08:15.649 --> 08:18.883
get out of an apartment
I was evicting him from.

08:18.885 --> 08:21.219
Franco got mugged.
They took the deposit bag.

08:21.221 --> 08:23.688
- With the $700 in it.
- Don't worry about that now.

08:23.690 --> 08:24.823
The important thing is you're okay.

08:24.825 --> 08:26.257
Now go on, clean up that wound.

08:26.259 --> 08:27.692
I'm sorry, man.

08:27.694 --> 08:29.694
How interesting.

08:29.696 --> 08:31.363
The first night
you give him the deposit,

08:31.365 --> 08:33.063
he is mugged.

08:33.066 --> 08:35.467
Notice my quotes in air.

08:35.469 --> 08:37.402
He didn't take the money, Fawz.

08:37.404 --> 08:39.304
- How do you know?
- Because if he took it

08:39.306 --> 08:40.672
he would-he would have counted it,

08:40.674 --> 08:44.743
and realized that I only put $30 in it.

08:44.745 --> 08:46.678
I don't understand.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.580
It was a test. I was
gonna take the rest of it

08:48.582 --> 08:50.148
later to the bank myself.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.684
I knew you didn't trust him!

08:52.686 --> 08:54.753
We are not so different you and I.

08:54.755 --> 08:56.888
Tell me, in <i>Sex and the City,</i>

08:56.890 --> 08:58.623
which girl are we? Miranda, right?

09:02.628 --> 09:04.229
My God, what have I done?

09:04.231 --> 09:06.531
The kid risked his life for $30.

09:06.533 --> 09:10.235
What if he finds out he risked
his life for $30?

09:10.237 --> 09:11.870
Why are you so worried?

09:11.872 --> 09:13.304
The police will never catch the mugger.

09:13.306 --> 09:15.673
And Franco will never know
how much was in the bag.

09:15.675 --> 09:18.243
Your secret is safe.

09:18.245 --> 09:20.245
Be cool, be cool.

09:20.247 --> 09:21.679
- Be cool... put a foot...
- Uh, uh...

09:21.681 --> 09:23.415
- All right, which one?
- Pick a side!

09:23.417 --> 09:26.351
- Arthur, Franco just called.
- Is he okay?

09:26.353 --> 09:29.054
There's nothing you can prove!

09:29.056 --> 09:31.589
Just a couple guys talking
about <i>Sex and the City.</i>

09:31.591 --> 09:33.492
Stop it.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.226
He got banged up a little bit.

09:35.228 --> 09:36.661
He's in the bathroom washing up.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.531
- Hey. Thanks for getting here so quick.
- No problem.

09:39.533 --> 09:40.701
- Just tell us what happened.
- Okay.

09:40.726 --> 09:42.833
Starting with exactly
how much was stolen.

09:42.858 --> 09:44.636
Well, it was $700. Right, Arthur?

09:44.638 --> 09:46.471
Well, maybe,
you know, a little bit more.

09:46.473 --> 09:48.773
Or a whole lot less.

09:48.775 --> 09:50.775
Why are the police here?

09:50.777 --> 09:52.343
What's going on?

09:52.345 --> 09:55.046
Franco's giving us a statement.
He was just mugged.

09:55.048 --> 09:57.182
Gosh, if there was someone, anyone,

09:57.184 --> 09:59.017
who could help with a police sketch.

09:59.019 --> 10:00.985
Oh, here he is.

10:01.954 --> 10:03.788
Come on, y'all.
I already know who did it.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.290
It was Crackhead Kevin.

10:05.292 --> 10:06.925
Is that Crackhead Daryl's cousin?

10:06.927 --> 10:09.994
How many crackheads are in this family?

10:09.996 --> 10:11.729
There are six.

10:11.731 --> 10:13.998
We call 'em the Crackdashians.

10:16.202 --> 10:18.901
- We're still gonna need a description.
- Oh, come on!

10:18.926 --> 10:20.206
You're not gonna make him relive it.

10:20.231 --> 10:21.573
He's already been through enough.

10:21.575 --> 10:23.007
No, we're getting the money back.

10:23.009 --> 10:25.310
He was black, probably in his mid 30s.

10:25.312 --> 10:26.911
- Eye color? Hair color?
- Did he have

10:26.913 --> 10:29.981
any hobbies?
Soccer, fishing, gymnastics?

10:29.983 --> 10:32.650
Oh! Does he like bees?

10:32.652 --> 10:35.186
We'll call it in, but I got
to be honest with you guys,

10:35.188 --> 10:36.955
the odds of getting that money
back are pretty slim.

10:36.957 --> 10:39.858
Yeah, crackheads tend
to be impulse buyers.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.193
Of crack.

10:42.195 --> 10:44.496
No problem! It's only money!
R-Right? Right? Right?

10:44.498 --> 10:46.364
- Arthur, I'm gonna pay you back
- No.

10:46.366 --> 10:48.399
- every dime.
- No, don't be crazy.

10:48.401 --> 10:49.701
You haven't got that kind of money.

10:49.703 --> 10:51.874
No, but my Grandma CiCi
got me a savings bond

10:51.899 --> 10:53.843
when I was a kid, and I was
saving up for art school...

10:53.868 --> 10:56.674
- I'm not gonna take it.
- Fine, let me work overtime then.

10:56.676 --> 10:58.776
Or I'll get another job.

10:58.778 --> 10:59.844
Or I'll sell my Jordans.

10:59.846 --> 11:01.112
Will you stop?

11:01.114 --> 11:02.480
Dude, let me make this up to you.

11:02.482 --> 11:04.749
You-you gave me a job,
and I screwed up. All right?

11:04.751 --> 11:07.118
And I'm-I'm not gonna rest
till I get your $700 back.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.420
Look, it wasn't $700.

11:09.422 --> 11:11.923
It was $30, okay?

11:12.073 --> 11:13.555
Wait...

11:13.743 --> 11:15.431
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- Look,

11:15.629 --> 11:18.493
I was just trying to find out
if I could trust you. All right?

11:19.199 --> 11:21.099
So this was some sort of test?

11:21.101 --> 11:23.001
Yeah, but the good news is you passed.

11:23.003 --> 11:25.103
Hmm? So, yay.

11:25.105 --> 11:27.205
I can trust you now.

11:27.207 --> 11:29.807
Put 'er there, homie.

11:29.809 --> 11:32.810
I can't believe you, man.

11:34.714 --> 11:36.814
But...

11:40.019 --> 11:43.087
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if he got mugged again?

11:43.089 --> 11:45.883
Not ha-ha funny. Ironic!

11:51.879 --> 11:53.534
Oh, hey! There he is!

11:53.559 --> 11:55.845
Some may say he's ten minutes late,

11:55.847 --> 11:58.381
but I say he's ten minutes great!

11:58.383 --> 11:59.649
Drop it, Arthur.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.918
Oh. Hey, hey, come on.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.387
I said I'm sorry
about yesterday, all right?

12:04.389 --> 12:05.655
Did you get my texts?

12:05.657 --> 12:07.256
- Nope.
- Really?

12:07.258 --> 12:09.726
I sent you a bunch of them
telling you how terrible I felt.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.528
I also sent you a sad face
and a peace sign.

12:12.530 --> 12:15.298
And a Japanese flag,
but that was an accident.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.699
Well, I didn't get 'em.

12:16.701 --> 12:17.800
Well, who did?

12:17.802 --> 12:19.802
Arthur, thank you for your texts.

12:19.804 --> 12:23.039
I don't know what you did,
but of course I forgive you.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.708
Your emotional plea
has broken down my walls.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.210
Those texts were not for you.

12:27.212 --> 12:31.781
Oh. Well, then my walls
just got five feet taller.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.384
Now, look, I was thinking,

12:34.386 --> 12:36.322
maybe I ought to give you a few
more responsibilities around here.

12:36.347 --> 12:38.838
Arthur, stop feeling guilty,
all right? I get it.

12:38.863 --> 12:40.254
I've only worked here two weeks, right?

12:40.279 --> 12:41.221
Hmm?

12:41.246 --> 12:42.925
So, listen, I'm just gonna shut up,

12:42.927 --> 12:45.561
do my job, and collect my paycheck.

12:45.563 --> 12:48.567
Oh, come on. Come on, I...
Hey, don't be like that.

12:48.592 --> 12:49.932
Would you two please stop fighting?

12:49.934 --> 12:51.334
You're just like my parents,

12:51.336 --> 12:53.779
except with way more sexual chemistry.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.373
Our family therapist
taught us an exercise

12:57.375 --> 12:59.475
for rebuilding trust
that I think would help you.

12:59.477 --> 13:01.310
Would you sit here and give it a shot?

13:01.312 --> 13:03.713
Yes, yes, I will. And so will he.

13:03.715 --> 13:05.674
If you want to get your paycheck.

13:05.699 --> 13:07.984
- Fine.
- Now, eye contact

13:07.986 --> 13:10.052
is a way of expressing vulnerability.

13:10.054 --> 13:12.922
So I want you to hold hands and
look at each other in the eyes

13:12.924 --> 13:14.590
for a full 60 seconds.

13:14.592 --> 13:16.825
Come on.

13:22.099 --> 13:24.534
Sorry my hands are sweaty.

13:24.536 --> 13:26.602
And rough.

13:26.604 --> 13:29.192
Like a dog's tongue.

13:29.274 --> 13:31.817
Yours are surprisingly soft.

13:32.551 --> 13:34.809
It's cocoa butter.

13:36.489 --> 13:38.915
I never held the hands
of a black man before, you know?

13:38.917 --> 13:40.550
What?

13:40.552 --> 13:41.984
No, it's nice. I could get used to it.

13:41.986 --> 13:44.353
I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
I'm out of here.

13:44.355 --> 13:45.688
Franco,

13:45.690 --> 13:47.373
look what the crack dragged in.

13:47.398 --> 13:48.558
Is this the guy who mugged you?

13:48.560 --> 13:50.059
Yeah, that's him.

13:50.061 --> 13:52.937
Um... I don't think so.

13:54.132 --> 13:56.116
How'd you know I play soccer?

13:57.901 --> 13:59.135
That's him. Crackhead Kevin.

13:59.137 --> 14:00.470
Yo, man. Stop calling me that.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.804
I'm on lots of stuff.

14:01.806 --> 14:03.739
Why's everyone always got
to focus on the crack?

14:03.741 --> 14:06.258
- Just take him to the car.
- Yeah.

14:06.283 --> 14:08.008
Man, Franco, $30?!

14:08.033 --> 14:09.712
You was walking like you had
a lot of money in that bag!

14:09.714 --> 14:11.781
I trusted you.

14:11.783 --> 14:14.550
Oh, see that? Crackheads
trust me more than you.

14:14.552 --> 14:17.386
Oh, come on! What's it gonna
take to make you understand

14:17.388 --> 14:18.921
that I trust you, all right?

14:18.923 --> 14:20.990
What have I got to do,
put my life in your hands?

14:20.992 --> 14:23.593
You know...? Wait, I could do that.

14:23.595 --> 14:25.428
What are you... what are you doing?

14:25.430 --> 14:28.865
I-I'm... Hey, wh-what is it
called where you catch someone?

14:28.867 --> 14:29.941
Marriage?

14:29.966 --> 14:31.767
Huh? No.

14:31.769 --> 14:34.277
A trust fall. That's right.
I'm gonna get up here

14:34.302 --> 14:35.763
and do a trust fall.
You're gonna catch me.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.155
- Arthur, no.
- No, no, that's too high!

14:38.181 --> 14:40.376
Yeah, and people eat on there.

14:40.378 --> 14:41.611
Eh, don't worry about it.

14:41.613 --> 14:42.845
Because he's gonna catch me.

14:42.847 --> 14:44.013
You ready?

14:44.015 --> 14:45.882
One, two...

14:45.884 --> 14:47.450
- I'm not doing this.
- Hey, come on.

14:47.452 --> 14:48.684
Where you goin'?!

14:48.686 --> 14:50.319
Hey, get back here.

14:50.321 --> 14:52.755
- One, two...
- Be careful!

14:52.757 --> 14:54.690
Yes, you have your whole...

14:54.692 --> 14:57.293
a couple of years ahead of you.

14:57.295 --> 14:59.262
All right, we're gonna do this
one more time, huh?

14:59.264 --> 15:02.031
- One, two...
- Arthur, get down.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.766
I don't even care anymore.

15:03.768 --> 15:06.702
Okay? And it's not like you're the
first boss who didn't trust me.

15:06.704 --> 15:08.304
I get it.

15:08.306 --> 15:10.006
I'm young, I'm black.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.528
It comes with the territory.

15:12.762 --> 15:15.785
Y... I just thought you'd be different.

15:20.851 --> 15:22.852
So, you gonna go talk to him

15:22.854 --> 15:25.983
or should we start throwing
dollar bills at you?

15:29.335 --> 15:30.732
Hey.

15:31.895 --> 15:34.664
- You taking the garbage out?
- Yeah.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.232
You know, I think
the beauty salon next door

15:36.234 --> 15:37.733
has been using our Dumpster.

15:37.735 --> 15:40.836
The garbage is full of hair
and nail clippings.

15:40.838 --> 15:43.906
Man, I hope it's the salon.

15:43.908 --> 15:46.375
Hey, look, you got to understand,

15:46.377 --> 15:48.344
the reason I didn't trust you
is because...

15:48.346 --> 15:49.946
Well, it-it's very hard for me

15:49.948 --> 15:53.015
to, uh, trust... people.

15:53.017 --> 15:54.483
Yeah. I got it.

15:54.485 --> 15:57.220
Hey, did I ever show you a
picture of my first employee?

15:57.222 --> 15:59.822
- No, you didn't.
- Look. Yeah.

15:59.824 --> 16:03.492
This is our company
Christmas party, 1970.

16:04.561 --> 16:05.962
Isn't that your wife?

16:05.964 --> 16:07.930
Yeah. She was my first employee.

16:07.932 --> 16:10.266
About a month after I opened,
I was looking to hire someone,

16:10.268 --> 16:12.301
and she walked in,
asking for an apple fritter.

16:12.303 --> 16:14.103
So I told her,
"I'm not gonna give it to you

16:14.105 --> 16:15.638
unless you take the job."

16:15.640 --> 16:18.841
Get it, Arthur.

16:18.843 --> 16:20.443
Oh, I got it.

16:20.445 --> 16:24.380
So, for the next 46 years,
it was just Joanie and me in here. I...

16:24.382 --> 16:27.051
I never knew I had to trust
anyone else, you know?

16:28.719 --> 16:32.188
Wait, so I'm your...
I'm your second employee?

16:32.190 --> 16:33.793
Right. Till now,

16:33.903 --> 16:36.826
all my employees
were sleeping with the boss.

16:36.828 --> 16:38.894
I'm glad that policy has changed.

16:40.131 --> 16:43.733
Oh. She was the only other one
to know about this.

16:45.135 --> 16:47.970
- What?
- That's right. My safe.

16:47.972 --> 16:50.039
Is that where you keep all your
compliments and encouragement?

16:50.041 --> 16:54.977
The combination is 10-26-14.

16:56.347 --> 16:58.247
Ron Santo, Billy Williams...

16:58.249 --> 16:59.882
- Ernie Banks.
- Ernie Banks.

16:59.884 --> 17:01.517
So from now on, your job

17:01.519 --> 17:03.953
is to take the weekend deposits,
put 'em in there,

17:03.955 --> 17:06.722
and then take 'em to the bank on Monday.

17:08.058 --> 17:09.724
Sounds good.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.027
Yes, it does.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.795
What's this?

17:12.797 --> 17:15.031
Oh, it's just... it's
a bunch of stuff that I left

17:15.032 --> 17:17.465
just in case I was the first one to go.

17:17.468 --> 17:19.135
No, there's some recipes,
account numbers,

17:19.137 --> 17:20.636
and, oh, and-and some, uh...

17:20.637 --> 17:22.972
some photos of me
for her to remember me by.

17:22.973 --> 17:24.906
- Like this one?
- Yeah.

17:24.909 --> 17:28.210
- Of you wearing nothing but an apron?
- Yeah.

17:28.212 --> 17:31.414
This apron?

17:33.050 --> 17:35.507
Hey, hey, come on. That's from 1970.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.720
- That's a relic.
- You are nasty.

17:44.825 --> 17:46.192
What's this?

17:46.194 --> 17:47.893
Well, since you were
asking, I brought you some

17:47.895 --> 17:50.763
of my cocoa butter.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.298
Oh, thank you. Hmm.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.149
Now, this is just for my hands?

17:56.911 --> 17:59.145
Give me that back. You a freak, man...

17:59.170 --> 18:00.539
No, no.

18:00.541 --> 18:03.716
I was talking about my knees!
I have scaly knees!

18:06.202 --> 18:08.302
It's nice to see those two
getting along again.

18:08.326 --> 18:09.464
Yeah.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.084
That's what real trust looks like.

18:12.086 --> 18:13.753
Hey, Randy, Randy.

18:13.755 --> 18:15.454
Why don't you tell James
an embarrassing secret

18:15.456 --> 18:17.823
about yourself
so he can tell anyone he wants.

18:17.859 --> 18:19.625
Would that make things better?

18:19.627 --> 18:22.228
- It would.
- All right.

18:24.432 --> 18:27.867
Remember that song "Maneater"
by Hall & Oates?

18:27.869 --> 18:29.201
Yeah.

18:30.037 --> 18:32.538
It's based on me.

18:32.540 --> 18:35.308
So your embarrassing secret

18:35.310 --> 18:38.511
is that somebody wrote
a hit song about you?

18:38.513 --> 18:40.046
Well, did you hear the lyric?

18:40.048 --> 18:42.081
They call me a she-cat.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.283
Are you kidding me?!

18:44.285 --> 18:46.937
This is not embarrassing! This is cool!

18:46.962 --> 18:49.088
And I know because I am not cool!

18:49.407 --> 18:51.351
I'm out of here!

18:51.376 --> 18:53.092
James, wait. How about this?

18:53.094 --> 18:55.394
One of my boobs is
bigger than the other!

18:55.396 --> 18:58.810
- Well, I tried.
- Oh, by the way,

18:58.835 --> 19:01.100
- I bought a new apron.
- Oh.

19:01.102 --> 19:02.201
It really bothered you, didn't it?

19:02.203 --> 19:03.569
- Yes.
- Yeah. Well,

19:03.571 --> 19:04.709
you're not gonna want to sit there.

19:04.734 --> 19:07.173
What is wrong with you?

19:07.175 --> 19:09.709
- Or there.
- Oh, my God!
