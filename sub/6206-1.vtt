00:52.752 --> 00:54.276
Everybody inside!

00:54.354 --> 00:56.652
Come on. Time for your chores.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.951
But, Sister Mary-Mengele, the game's tied.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.357
Can't we just play another
couple minutes? Please!

01:01.461 --> 01:03.986
No, you can't. Now get inside.

01:04.096 --> 01:09.091
And pick up that soccer can and put it back
in the equipment shed where it belongs.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.694
Wait a second, Sis, you got to hear us out.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.206
<i>We didn't ask for this</i>

01:15.875 --> 01:18.469
<i>We didn't pray for this</i>

01:19.279 --> 01:23.978
<i>I may not have a sis
Or know my mother's kiss</i>

01:24.150 --> 01:29.144
<i>But that doesn't matter because</i>

01:32.959 --> 01:35.553
<i>Everybody is special</i>

01:35.662 --> 01:37.960
<i>We're not inconsequential</i>

01:38.031 --> 01:39.464
Shut up!

01:39.532 --> 01:41.466
<i>What do you think this is,
The Sound of Music?</i>

01:41.734 --> 01:43.793
Get in there. Come on.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.130
Enough with the singing.

01:45.205 --> 01:47.537
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:50.102
<i>Roadrunner, roadrunner</i>

01:50.176 --> 01:54.272
Come on, come on, move it.
No wonder your parents didn't want yous.

01:55.415 --> 01:59.784
<i>Gonna drive past the Stop & Shop
With the radio on</i>

02:01.654 --> 02:03.918
<i>I'm in love with Massachusetts</i>

02:04.691 --> 02:07.319
<i>And the neon when it's cold outside</i>

02:08.161 --> 02:10.890
<i>And the highway when it's late at night</i>

02:11.197 --> 02:12.255
<i>With the radio on</i>

02:36.022 --> 02:37.182
Good Lord!

02:38.024 --> 02:40.356
Mother Superior, come quickly!

02:42.862 --> 02:46.389
Oh, my! Angels from heaven!

02:47.300 --> 02:51.031
They're like the Holy Trinity.
I get to give them the first bottle.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.196
Let me give them a bath.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.603
Can they sleep in my room tonight?

02:53.706 --> 02:57.540
Now hold on, ladies.
Everyone's going to get their turn.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.972
It's not my turn, get somebody else.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.571
Sister Ricarda, how about you?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.810
Will you please go tell the boys to
come down for lunch?

03:05.318 --> 03:07.650
I would, Mother Superior, I swear I would,

03:07.754 --> 03:11.087
but the doctor told me to
steer clear of them for a couple of weeks,

03:11.157 --> 03:12.647
on account of my nerves.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.954
How about you, Sister Rosemary?

03:15.061 --> 03:16.551
Oh, yeah! Just like the Army?

03:16.629 --> 03:18.927
Put the black folks on the front line. Uh-uh.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.398
What about Sister Mary-Mengele?
She knows how to handle them.

03:21.467 --> 03:24.402
Oh, poor thing. She has a toothache,
so she went to lie down.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.265
You mean she's asleep?

03:26.506 --> 03:28.133
Where are the boys?

03:28.274 --> 03:29.502
Huh.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.476
I haven't seen a case like this in years.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.606
And would you look
at all that metal in her mouth.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.314
Must be too much iron in the water.

03:37.517 --> 03:40.247
Don't you worry, Sis. You're in good hands.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.254
We'll have that bum tooth out in no time.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.357
- Anesthetic.
- Anesthetic.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.858
Anesthetic.

03:50.863 --> 03:53.093
Fifteen milligrams. Give.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.094
Five, ten, fifteen.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.236
Boys?

04:03.009 --> 04:03.998
Open up, please.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.102
It's the head penguin.
Boxcar seven on three. Break.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.272
One, two, three.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.984
I said open this door.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.294
What are you three up to?

04:24.197 --> 04:25.630
Just dabbling in the arts.

04:25.698 --> 04:26.960
Indubitably.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.024
Oh! Well, lunch is ready.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.729
Oh, boy. Eats.

04:37.677 --> 04:38.939
You're not going to believe this.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.446
That rich couple just called.
They're going to be here in five minutes.

04:41.714 --> 04:44.478
Oh, goodness! But we're not prepared.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.683
All right, well,
you'd better inform all the children

04:47.787 --> 04:49.220
and tell them to
make themselves presentable.

04:49.989 --> 04:53.152
- What about Moe, Larry and Curly?
- Well, you know what to do,

04:53.226 --> 04:55.387
just throw them some chew toys
and keep them out of sight.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.859
We were thinking that

04:58.331 --> 05:02.358
maybe this time
we could hide the other kids

05:02.902 --> 05:05.234
and then with a little help from the Lord
we could...

05:05.338 --> 05:06.532
It's called the bait and switch.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.868
Absolutely not!

05:10.109 --> 05:13.135
Look, as much as I would love
to see those boys get adopted,

05:13.212 --> 05:15.442
I'm afraid they're not ready yet.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.177
And I can't chance
scaring off another couple.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.049
That's it! I quit.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.881
- What?
- It's too dangerous

05:25.992 --> 05:27.721
living around here with those three boys.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.318
I need a safer working environment.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.125
But where would you go?

05:32.465 --> 05:33.489
Don't worry about me.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.831
I got a cousin who hauls traps
on one of those Alaskan crab boats.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.463
One of the crew fell off
and got eaten by sharks.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.905
He's going to slide me right into that slot.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.498
You think they got room for one more?

05:43.576 --> 05:46.841
Okay, hold on, everybody.
Just wait a minute.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.188
Have the boys meet me in my office.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.416
I hope
you'll forgive us for coming early.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.425
We just couldn't stand to wait another day.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.552
Oh, we understand, Mrs. Harter.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.494
This is a great surprise.

06:05.565 --> 06:09.001
We have three delightful youngsters
for you to meet.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.367
Three? We were under the impression
there were more than that.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.337
Nope, that's it. Just the three.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.171
Children, get on in here.
Mr. And Mrs. Harter don't have all day.

06:17.677 --> 06:21.078
<i>Hello</i>

06:21.180 --> 06:22.169
Hello.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.312
How precious.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.722
Yes, I certainly don't envy you

06:32.825 --> 06:35.316
having to choose between
such amazing children.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.886
The choice is easy. I'm your guy.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.056
That is so cute.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.330
- Absolutely adorable. How long's he got?
- Hmm?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.564
He's taking chemo, right?

06:45.671 --> 06:47.662
No, no, no, he's healthy as a mule.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.537
And almost as smart.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.537
Recede, Bojangles.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.778
Pick me. I make the best potato peel
and eggshell smoothies in town.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.045
If you choose me,
I'll let you play with my pet rat, Nippy.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.610
I even taught him a few tricks.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.880
Oh, boys and their rodents.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.754
Mother Superior,
may I have a glass of milk, please?

07:09.695 --> 07:10.889
Oh, who is this?

07:11.030 --> 07:15.490
Hi, my name is Teddy,
and someday I'm going to have a puppy.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.928
Oh, my God! He's wonderful.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.832
I thought you said
there were only the three.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.839
I never said that. I said about three.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.943
All right, Teddy, get in line with the others.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.409
Go ahead.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.505
Down, boy.

07:29.582 --> 07:30.947
Straighten up, boys.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.213
Mr. And Mrs. Harter
have a big decision to make.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.022
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.143
Teddy, this is going to be a day
you'll never forget.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.213
My wife and I have decided

08:06.285 --> 08:09.812
that our family won't be complete

08:10.590 --> 08:14.822
until you tell Moe
that he's coming home with us.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.825
What do you say, sport?
You want to be part of a real family?

08:18.931 --> 08:20.489
Boy, would I ever!

08:22.235 --> 08:24.396
Thank you. We're so excited.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.897
Lf you fellas are ever out in horse country...

08:28.975 --> 08:31.000
...shopping for a polo pony,

08:32.144 --> 08:34.135
you'll look me up, right?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.845
Sure, Moe.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.782
We'II, you know, keep in touch.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.183
Ah! Quit your blubbering.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.280
What are you trying to do?
Rain on my parade?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.121
No, Moe. These are tears of joy. Honest.

08:48.761 --> 08:49.921
Sorry.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.588
You fellas mind if I have something
to remember you by?

08:54.967 --> 08:56.594
You name it, Moe.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.808
Come here, groundhog.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.807
Thanks, fellas.

09:14.453 --> 09:17.183
Hey, Moe, do you know what day today is?

09:17.957 --> 09:19.185
No clue.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.054
It's your birthday.

09:22.528 --> 09:23.552
Really?

09:23.663 --> 09:25.130
To us it is,

09:25.464 --> 09:28.160
because today
is the day that you came into our lives.

09:28.868 --> 09:31.530
So, what would you
like as a birthday present?

09:31.671 --> 09:35.505
Uh... I'm good.
This lollypop's really hitting the spot.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.839
Now, come on.

09:38.911 --> 09:42.244
Come on, there's got to be something
that would make your birthday complete.

09:42.348 --> 09:45.340
Just go crazy, champ.
Anything your heart desires.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.045
Well, when you put it that way.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.555
Well? What is it?

09:55.094 --> 09:56.356
He, uh...

09:57.396 --> 09:59.489
He wants us to go back
and get his two friends.

10:01.734 --> 10:02.996
Moe.

10:03.869 --> 10:07.600
Three youngsters are
an awful lot to take on all at once.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.239
Don't you see, Pop, that's the beauty of it.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.243
It's not going to cost you a dime extra.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.006
Them two termites can bunk with me.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.775
I'll even split my meals with them.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.178
Yeah, I don't know, Moe...

10:17.249 --> 10:19.717
And you don't have to worry about
sending them to fancy schools

10:19.785 --> 10:22.253
because they're not interested
in reading or numbers.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.222
Heavy lifting and ditch digging,
that's their dream.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.455
Wow.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.527
Those guys really mean a lot to you,
don't they?

10:35.534 --> 10:37.559
They're all I've ever had.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.028
Moe's right, honey.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.302
We can't possibly
separate these three boys.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.900
There we go. That's my mom talking.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.138
Forget it! It was a bad idea.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.245
I don't want nothing.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.416
Mommy, Daddy.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.784
Please!

10:57.790 --> 10:59.087
Don't go.

11:03.262 --> 11:04.456
Moe!

11:07.400 --> 11:09.595
Moe, what are you doing back?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.295
Uh...

11:12.271 --> 11:13.295
I...

11:13.406 --> 11:15.966
Come on, spill it. What happened?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.143
They were full of baloney.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.269
As soon as we got on the road,
they start spouting off

11:20.346 --> 11:24.578
about me eating my veggies
and washing behind my ears and chores!

11:24.750 --> 11:28.982
Get this, they wanted me to clean the pool
and squeegee the tennis courts.

11:29.088 --> 11:32.148
Every week! Oh, and by the way...

11:34.193 --> 11:36.320
That's for all the stupid things
you did while I was gone.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.360
I told you he'd find out.

11:38.464 --> 11:41.365
Come on. Let's go start a small brushfire
and whiz it out.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.777
It's 12:05 and nothing rang.

12:02.855 --> 12:06.018
Werert those morons
supposed to fix the bell last week?

12:06.125 --> 12:09.185
Have patience, Sister Mary-Mengele,
they do their best.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.160
At least they're working on something
in there.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.822
Yeah, they've been at it all morning.

12:12.998 --> 12:16.559
Yeah, well, I think I'll go have a little word
with them.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.633
When are you clowns going to fix that...

12:41.427 --> 12:42.724
I knew it.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.371
It's an earthquake.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.507
Man the lifeboats.
Women and children first.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.720
It's Attila the Nun.
She's 100 yards out and closing fast.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.049
You're lucky I'm not in charge

13:12.124 --> 13:14.592
or you three would've been run out of here
a long time ago.

13:14.760 --> 13:19.561
Now, get up on that roof and fix the bell,
you no-good lazy bums!

13:19.632 --> 13:21.122
Who're you calling lazy?

13:21.367 --> 13:23.961
You! And if any of yous
have got a problem with it

13:24.136 --> 13:26.536
you can step forward right now.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.936
Oh, yeah? You got something to say?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.070
Go ahead, champ. Show her who's boss.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.822
And left, right, left. Left, right, left.

13:49.929 --> 13:53.092
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.429
And company halt. Drop anchor.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.061
Here we go, here we go. There we go.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.403
- Success.
- Success.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.938
- Success.
- Success.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.839
All right, break it up.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.504
How're we going to get at the bell?
It's hiding in that box.

14:07.613 --> 14:10.582
Why don't you go buy a toupee
with some brains in it? We'll cut it open.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.776
Hey, onion-head, go on back to the shed
and grab the chainsaw.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.149
Why doesn't Larry go?

14:14.253 --> 14:16.084
- Because he's got a headache.
- No, I don't.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.216
- How about now?
- Yeah, it's coming on.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.924
Hey, guys, how's it hanging?

14:21.126 --> 14:22.320
- Heya, Murph.
- Hey, Murph.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.520
Hey, Murph.

14:23.629 --> 14:24.618
You feeling any better?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.927
We missed you at the poker game
last night.

14:27.433 --> 14:30.925
I'm okay, I guess.
So, who was the big winner?

14:31.170 --> 14:32.637
Ah! Peezer cleaned us out.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.602
Peezer? He's seven.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.267
Yeah, but he wears those sunglasses,
you can't tell what he's thinking.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.941
We'll check in on you later, Murph.

14:40.145 --> 14:41.544
- See you.
Bye, Murph.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.171
See you, Murph.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.118
Monsignor Ratliffe?
We werert expecting you.

14:53.459 --> 14:57.793
I need to speak to Mother Superior.
It's rather urgent.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.828
Here you go, Murph.
Look what I brought you!

15:01.133 --> 15:03.294
Oh, boy! Cheese!

15:05.271 --> 15:06.670
Where'd you snag this from?

15:06.772 --> 15:08.296
Mousetraps up in the attic.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.934
Oh, come on, Murph.

15:13.245 --> 15:17.011
You got to keep up your cheese molecules
so you can get your strength back.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.642
Enough with the melodrama.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.821
I'm sorry, Murph. It's just,

15:22.922 --> 15:26.688
ever since my brother, Weezer,
got shipped to that foster home

15:26.792 --> 15:28.089
you're all I got.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.220
Oh, Peez, come on.
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself again.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.232
You think you're the only kid in the world
who ever watched his parents drown,

15:34.300 --> 15:36.768
then got sent to an orphanage,
then a couple of weeks later

15:36.835 --> 15:40.828
had his only brother dragged away
kicking and screaming? Dude, it happens.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.602
Yeah, I know I'm being a wuss again.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.576
Look, Peez, I'm not going anywhere.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.739
You and me, we're family now.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.079
We're BFFs forever.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.846
Just like Moe, Larry and Curly.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.015
<i>Where's Curly with that saw?</i>

15:56.689 --> 15:58.452
How should I know?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.253
Well, come on, let's try to pry this thing off.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.123
- All right.
- We'll get this done the right way.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.662
- Yeah.
- Watch yourself. Wedge it.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.959
We're getting nowhere fast. Wait a minute.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.501
Hey, mongoose, grab that sledgehammer.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.263
On the count of three
hit down on this thing.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.327
You got it.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.270
Starting to get
a half a brain in my skull here.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.270
One, two, three.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.604
Sorry, Moe,
it was an honest mistake, honest!

16:21.780 --> 16:23.042
Oh, that's okay, kid.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.207
Mistakes can
happen in the best of families.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.683
This sledgehammer
is probably just a tad off-kilter.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.118
- Yeah, it did feel a little funny.
- Here, let me have a look.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.515
- Yeah, I know what you...
- Ow! My neck!

16:33.058 --> 16:34.525
- How do you feel now?
- All right.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.526
That's good.
Come on, what's a matter with you?

16:36.628 --> 16:38.289
Quit wasting time.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.855
And there's nothing else we can do?

16:41.367 --> 16:42.891
I'm afraid not.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.368
Please send for Moe, Larry and Curly.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.302
I better give them the news first.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.482
Yes, Mother Superior.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.652
I hope you're also going to tell them
who's responsible for this.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.483
Oh, let's not play the blame game, Sister.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.726
I'll just tell them what they need to know.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.108
Ah! Ah!

17:30.215 --> 17:31.273
Ah!

17:43.595 --> 17:46.496
- I got the saw, Moe.
- Yeah, well, you're too late...

17:46.565 --> 17:49.693
What's a matter with you?
You trying to hurt someone? Why you...

17:53.272 --> 17:54.432
Oh, look.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.440
- Now look what you did.
- It's not my fault.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.412
It was a chain reaction on the saw.
See? Saw.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.414
Oh, a punster, eh? Where's that hammer?

18:04.516 --> 18:05.574
- No.
- Where's that hammer?

18:05.684 --> 18:06.742
Give it to me.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.080
No, Moe, please! Oh, Moe!

18:08.487 --> 18:10.045
Oh, boys.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.180
No, no, Moe! I'm a victim of circumstance!

18:12.257 --> 18:14.088
I'll circumstance you!

18:20.265 --> 18:22.028
Those morons.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.869
Why you!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.370
What the...

18:26.438 --> 18:30.431
Hey! Quit horsing around, you two.
You're disturbing my coffee break.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.102
Oh, boy, donuts! Where's mine?

18:33.212 --> 18:34.770
They're small.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.745
- Why don't you have two?
- Okay.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.214
Ah!

18:39.451 --> 18:42.887
Now look what you did, Moe!
You got donut stuck in my ears.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.719
Hey, you're in luck.
They got a donut remover right here.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.918
- What's a donut remover?
- It's one of these.

18:48.727 --> 18:51.059
"Donut Remove-uh."

18:51.363 --> 18:53.490
- Huh. What are the odds of that?
Hey, mugwumps!

18:53.732 --> 18:55.927
Mother Superior is looking for you.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.035
Here, let me get it for you.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.904
Uh-oh! Is that Sister Mary-Mengele?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.472
I don't know, but the face rings a bell.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.551
Remind me
to gouge your eyeballs out later.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.814
Don't move a muscle, Sis,
we'll be right there.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.751
- Come on. Get going.
- Be careful.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.983
Here we go.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.684
Whoa! Whoa!

19:24.096 --> 19:26.894
Hey, Moe. Hey, Larry.
Fellas, do something!

19:26.965 --> 19:28.592
Moe. Moe!

19:28.667 --> 19:30.259
What's a matter with...

19:30.569 --> 19:32.901
Call 411!

19:32.971 --> 19:35.838
Quick! Help me move Sister M and M
before chowder-head crushes her.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.169
Come on.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.404
Come on, you!

19:46.818 --> 19:50.083
You, help out. You, grab that bucket,
splash some water on her.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.581
Oh!

19:53.659 --> 19:56.492
See, I told you
there's too much iron in the water.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.290
Speak to me, Sis. Say a few parables.

19:58.931 --> 20:02.298
I save 15% on my car insurance.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.268
She seems fine to me.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.304
Come on,
let's go see what Mother Superior wants.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.147
Hey, look!
Some wise guy is roughing up the sisters.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.712
Why you!

20:26.858 --> 20:28.348
Come on.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.223
Picking on girls, eh?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.563
How do you like that, pretty boy?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.397
You think you're pretty smooth, huh?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.042
Squish! Squish! Squish!

20:49.381 --> 20:50.643
Get off of him!

20:50.716 --> 20:53.981
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry!
Oopsie-daisy!

20:54.052 --> 20:56.020
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.382
What are you doing?

20:57.489 --> 21:00.083
We caught this lounge lizard
getting all handsy with the nuns.

21:00.192 --> 21:03.218
This is no lounge lizard!
He's here on official business.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.058
Official business? Why didn't you say so?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.664
Pick me, I'll clip your hedges.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.228
- I'll hedge your clippers.
- I'll fetch your slippers.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.534
I'll scrub the stench
right off them dentures.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.597
You idiots!

21:18.844 --> 21:20.607
I'm not here to adopt!

21:20.712 --> 21:23.579
This is Monsignor Ratliffe from the diocese.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.843
<i>Oh, sorry about that, Señor Ratlips.</i>

21:27.286 --> 21:31.222
Children, Sisters, everyone,
please gather round.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.187
I have an announcement to make.

21:34.259 --> 21:35.886
Oh! Are we getting pizza?

21:35.961 --> 21:36.950
Come, come.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.529
Pull it in.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.430
I'm sorry to have to tell you all this,

21:42.534 --> 21:47.369
but due to the recent economic downturn
and some unforeseen expenses

21:47.539 --> 21:51.805
the orphanage will be forced to close down
at the end of the month.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.910
But what's going to happen to the children?
And us.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.440
Well, you sisters
will be spread around the diocese

22:00.552 --> 22:03.783
and the children
will be sent to foster homes.

22:03.889 --> 22:06.756
Oh, boy, Foster's.
That's Australian for beer.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.224
Would you like that in a bottle or a mug?

22:08.293 --> 22:10.158
- I'll take it in a mug.
- You got it.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.752
Foster home?

22:11.930 --> 22:16.128
Forget it! I'm not going to end up
like Peezer's brother, Weezer.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.826
If someone wants to adopt me, I'll listen.

22:18.937 --> 22:21.770
But I'm not going anywhere
where they're getting paid to love me.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.104
Cheer up, Murph. There's talk of pizza.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.803
Wait a minute, Monsignor.
There's got to be something we can do.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.938
Yeah, what's it going to take
to save this place?

22:30.115 --> 22:31.673
- A lot of this.
Oh!

22:31.983 --> 22:35.475
Well, that's doable.
How many boogers are we talking about?

22:36.154 --> 22:38.679
Not boogers, dollars, you moron.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.054
Eight hundred and thirty thousand
of them, to be exact.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.096
You can't let them close us down, Mother.
You can't!

22:46.164 --> 22:47.654
This is our home.

22:48.433 --> 22:51.334
Hold on there, skin-tags.
When do you need that money by?

22:51.436 --> 22:52.767
Thirty days.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.872
- Well, consider it done.
That's right.

22:54.973 --> 22:58.101
Thirty days from now we'll have enough
cash to rent ten of these kid factories.

22:58.176 --> 22:59.541
Oh, yeah, how?

23:00.812 --> 23:04.373
- Why, by doing whatever it takes.
- We'll climb mountains.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.815
- We'll forge rivers.
- We'll forge checks.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.785
Come on, let's get packing.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.344
Attention!

23:12.557 --> 23:14.024
About face.

23:15.527 --> 23:18.724
Company, march!
March! March, march, march!

23:23.335 --> 23:24.825
Goodbye, everybody.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.030
Bye, guys. Bye, you take care.

23:27.139 --> 23:30.734
No cheating in cards.
I'll say hi to Santa. Yeah, I will.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.570
I'm concerned.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.510
Those three boys are
going to be eaten alive out there.

23:35.714 --> 23:36.976
We're going to try sushi.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.141
They don't even know anyone
their own age.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.818
All they know is nuns and kids.

23:41.887 --> 23:45.254
She's right, Mother Superior.
You know how long I've waited for this day.

23:45.357 --> 23:48.087
But now that it's here, I don't know.

23:48.193 --> 23:52.357
Well, what choice do we have?
They either leave today or next month.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.590
Like Moses in the desert,
I believe the Lord will guide them

23:56.701 --> 23:58.430
because they're pure of heart.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.535
And dim of wit.

24:03.608 --> 24:04.734
Boys.

24:08.079 --> 24:09.706
Good luck to you.

24:10.549 --> 24:14.041
Here's a little money
to get you through your first few days.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.711
Good luck, guys.

24:16.421 --> 24:18.218
Don't worry, Peez, you can tell Murph

24:18.290 --> 24:20.019
we're going to be back in a flash
with the cash.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.217
Yeah!

24:24.062 --> 24:26.963
All right, children, let's say goodbye.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.700
<i>Goodbye</i>

24:30.769 --> 24:32.202
Goodbye.

24:32.270 --> 24:37.003
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

24:37.075 --> 24:40.602
<i>Oh, this little light of mine</i>

24:40.979 --> 24:43.641
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

24:43.715 --> 24:47.151
<i>Let it shine
Let it shine</i>

24:47.686 --> 24:50.280
<i>Let it shine</i>

24:51.423 --> 24:53.448
<i>- This little light of mine
- Oh, Lord</i>

24:53.525 --> 24:55.755
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:57.192
<i>This little light of mine</i>

24:57.262 --> 25:00.254
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine, yeah
- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

25:00.332 --> 25:02.857
<i>- This little light of mine
- I'm gonna let...</i>

25:02.934 --> 25:03.992
Shut up!

25:04.903 --> 25:08.134
This ain't a revival, it's an orphanage.

25:08.607 --> 25:11.838
She's right. Time's a-wasting.
Let's saddle up, boys.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.506
Come on, get busy.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.110
- Seatbelt, check.
- Check.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.275
Check.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.945
Bell tone.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.079
- Check.
- Tow rope.

25:24.155 --> 25:25.315
Check.

25:35.433 --> 25:38.266
Hey, bunion-head,
you forgot to tie us off to the handlebars.

25:38.336 --> 25:40.668
I couldn't reach it
so I tied us to the back tire.

25:40.772 --> 25:42.034
Oh, good.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.804
You feather-brained...
I'm warning you!

25:46.878 --> 25:48.505
I think we got a flat tire.

25:53.518 --> 25:55.281
Maybe we should let go.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.867
<i>Do we really have to knock him off?
What?</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:13.833
Why can't you just divorce him?

26:13.905 --> 26:17.534
You know why.
His father made me sign a prenup.

26:17.642 --> 26:21.578
So what? We have each other.
We don't need your husband's money.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.712
Maybe we don't need it. But I want it.

26:27.385 --> 26:30.081
Look, if you're too much of a wuss,
just tell me...

26:30.188 --> 26:32.918
Oh, no, no, no, I told you.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.219
I'm all in.

26:35.727 --> 26:38.195
I want your hubby gone
just as badly as you do.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.924
I'm just new at this, that's all.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.201
Okay. So how are we going to do it?

26:45.537 --> 26:47.368
What is that racket?

26:54.846 --> 26:58.942
$830,000. First taker gets
a three-man working machine.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.417
It's all spelled out
in this here contract, folks.

27:01.519 --> 27:03.009
That's right, no job is too small,

27:03.088 --> 27:04.715
we'll press your pants,
we'll shine your shoes.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.553
We'll raid your fridge and drink your booze.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.617
What's a matter with you?
Quit giving away the fine print.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.719
- Hey, what's the idea?
- Shut up.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.457
Now smarten up, you two,
or have you forgotten

27:13.565 --> 27:15.089
there's a bunch of little kids
counting on us?

27:15.200 --> 27:17.464
And we've only got 27 days left
to raise that dough.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.561
Hey, bub, your trousers are falling down,
let me help you.

27:21.906 --> 27:24.067
Hey, man,
you trying to get yourself capped?

27:24.142 --> 27:25.905
Oh, no thanks, I don't wear hats.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.207
Why would I with a head of hair like this?

27:28.279 --> 27:29.746
You believe this guy?

27:29.814 --> 27:31.304
Crazy, man.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.216
See you later, fellas.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.448
I think we just found
the answer to our prayers.

27:39.891 --> 27:41.415
Boys, we're getting nowhere fast.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.256
Now spread out
and go drum up some business.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.693
All right.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.129
- Go on.
- I'll go when I'm ready.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.564
- Are you ready?
- Sure, I'm ready.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.393
Go on.

27:51.469 --> 27:55.599
Eight hundred and thirty thousand bucks.
We prefer it in hundreds, folks.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.832
Wow, in the wrong hands,
this thing could be dangerous.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.503
Guys, we've been at this for days now

28:25.603 --> 28:27.537
and all I got is a hole in my shoe.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.639
The kid's right.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.474
There must be a better way to
make a living. Come on, think.

28:39.317 --> 28:40.511
No. No.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.889
- Look, he's on to something.
- Spit it out, tiger.

28:50.829 --> 28:53.627
I can't! It's stuck. Jar it loose, Moe.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.495
What about a job
where you could sleep all day,

28:55.567 --> 28:56.727
meet beautiful babes at night

28:56.835 --> 28:58.632
and make millions
for doing absolutely nothing.

28:58.703 --> 29:02.139
Oh, boy! That's genius. So what's the job?

29:02.207 --> 29:03.902
- That is the job.
- Oh, that is...

29:04.909 --> 29:07.002
- And who's going to pay you?
- The boss.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.046
You know, it's just crazy enough to work.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.843
Why, you... And you!

29:11.916 --> 29:13.042
Come on in here.

29:13.618 --> 29:14.983
Oh! Oh!

29:15.053 --> 29:16.918
Oh, look, Moe, I think we got a customer.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.252
Whoa!
Would you look at those getaway sticks.

29:23.995 --> 29:25.428
Spread out.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.495
I'm the foreman here.
What can we do for you?

29:32.036 --> 29:37.030
I'll pay you $830,000 for a job
that won't take you more than 10 minutes.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.536
We'll take it, who do we have to murder?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.046
My husband.

29:43.581 --> 29:47.415
Sorry, lady, you came to the wrong place.
We're working stiffs, not common crooks.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.955
But you don't understand.
You will be doing him a great service.

29:51.055 --> 29:53.114
- Says who?
- Says me.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.193
- Who are you?
- I'm her husband.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.390
Wait a minute, you mean to tell me,

30:00.465 --> 30:02.456
she's planning your funeral
and you're okay with it?

30:02.567 --> 30:04.034
Well, I know it sounds a bit peculiar.

30:04.102 --> 30:06.798
No, no, no, that doesn't sound peculiar.
This sounds peculiar.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.375
Phew. Okay.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.775
My husband is suffering from

30:14.879 --> 30:17.541
an incurable disease
that eventually will kill him.

30:17.882 --> 30:21.181
Unfortunately, it could take a year,
possibly more.

30:21.286 --> 30:25.279
Pain increasing daily
before I lapse into an irreversible coma.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.483
I had that. Only it was just in my feet. Yeah.

30:27.592 --> 30:28.684
It's called coma-toes.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.659
- Oh, coma-toes, huh?
- Yeah.

30:33.731 --> 30:36.029
Are they awake now?

30:36.134 --> 30:37.465
Gentlemen.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.025
Gentlemen.

30:40.438 --> 30:44.101
I'm sure you can understand why I prefer
to leave this world on my own terms

30:44.175 --> 30:47.110
rather than spend the rest of my life
a vegetable.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.510
I don't know. It sounds illegal.

30:50.215 --> 30:53.673
Wait a minute, legs,
did you say 830,000 bucks?

30:53.785 --> 30:54.809
I did.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.888
That's a good day's pay.

30:58.623 --> 30:59.647
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.385
That's exactly the amount of money
we're looking for.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.790
You're right. This must be fate, time bomb.
You can count us in.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.989
That's swell.

31:09.567 --> 31:10.659
Thank you.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.531
- Now here's what we were thinking.
Yes?

31:13.638 --> 31:16.698
I'd like you to sneak into our bedroom
in the middle of the night

31:16.808 --> 31:18.400
and smother me while I'm sleeping.

31:18.576 --> 31:19.736
Yes, yes.

31:19.844 --> 31:23.143
But do not turn on the lights.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.705
No. No. No.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.115
Wait a minute.
Why don't you want the lights on?

31:30.255 --> 31:32.280
Well, I want it to be a surprise.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.688
Oh, I get it,
you don't want to see it coming, eh?

31:35.260 --> 31:36.420
Bingo.

31:36.527 --> 31:39.724
Hey, look, it's the guy from that thing
all the kids are talking about.

31:49.307 --> 31:50.774
Help, help, help!

32:02.720 --> 32:03.744
That settles that.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.812
- Success.
- Success.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.391
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:07.458 --> 32:10.291
What did you do? That was not the plan!

32:10.395 --> 32:11.384
What're you yacking about?

32:11.462 --> 32:12.793
He just said he didn't want
to see it coming.

32:12.897 --> 32:13.955
Hey, hey.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.329
You look like you could
use a grief massage.

32:16.434 --> 32:20.131
Let it go. Let it go. Try to live in the now.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.399
Get off me!

32:25.677 --> 32:27.144
Too soon?

32:47.665 --> 32:49.496
Hey, you smell garbage burning?

32:49.567 --> 32:50.932
Ah! Ah! Ah!

32:55.473 --> 32:56.667
What are you doing here?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.333
We want the do-re-mi you owe us, lady.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.173
Yeah, 830,000 bucks.

33:01.245 --> 33:02.303
Plus meals.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.708
May I have a moment, ma'am?

33:06.150 --> 33:08.175
Excuse me, gentlemen.

33:10.555 --> 33:11.715
Mind your P's and Q's.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.620
- Don't forget to dot the I's.
- Certainly.

33:17.528 --> 33:19.928
I'm afraid I have unfortunate news.

33:20.031 --> 33:24.092
I've just received word
that Mr. Miosky was struck by a bus.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.862
Oh, no! So Mac is dead?

33:26.938 --> 33:27.927
No.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.337
No? Are you sure?

33:30.408 --> 33:34.208
Oh, yes.
He's still alive, but he's in bad shape.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.946
Your husband is
in contact with the hospital.

33:37.048 --> 33:39.073
He said he'd call with any news.

33:39.717 --> 33:41.241
Thank you, Carbunkle.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.948
Oh, my God.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.250
Come on, blondie, pay up. A deal's a deal.

33:47.658 --> 33:51.150
Our deal was that you would get paid
when my husband died.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.231
And on that count
you have failed miserably.

33:54.298 --> 33:55.458
You mean he's still kicking?

33:55.566 --> 33:56.794
That's right, you idiots!

33:56.901 --> 33:59.131
You have ruined my life,
now get out of here.

34:11.748 --> 34:14.013
- Boy, what a hothead.
- Women!

34:14.118 --> 34:15.107
Wait a second,

34:15.186 --> 34:17.585
with her hubby laid out in the hospital
nursing them tire tracks,

34:17.655 --> 34:20.021
it'll be easy pickings to slide a pillow
over the poor schlump's face

34:20.123 --> 34:21.523
and give him the surprise send-off
he wanted.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.924
Good thinking!
We'll be doing the guy a favor

34:23.995 --> 34:25.963
and making enough money
to save the orphanage.

34:26.030 --> 34:27.827
It's like killing two birds with one pillow.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.159
- It's colossal.
- It's stupendous.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.893
It's even mediocre.

34:30.967 --> 34:31.992
Ow!

34:32.070 --> 34:33.697
- Say, "Ah."
- Ah...

34:34.237 --> 34:35.637
Come on!

34:48.186 --> 34:50.484
Okay, you lumps.
Just keep your lips zippered.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.647
I'll sweet-talk our way in.

34:57.161 --> 34:59.152
Hey, bulldog, how's about being a sport...

34:59.263 --> 35:01.595
...and letting us visit an old pal?
What do you say?

35:01.666 --> 35:04.157
Can't you read? Visiting hours are over.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.369
- Even for family?
- Are you family?

35:06.471 --> 35:08.666
- Certainly.
- Oh, yeah? What's your relation?

35:08.773 --> 35:10.434
His mother and my mother
were both mothers.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.807
You heard me, no more visitors.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.179
Come on.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.481
Follow me. I got an idea.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.977
That the best you can do?
You're scaring the customers.

35:54.051 --> 35:56.349
I'm sorry, I didn't bring my false eyelashes.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.824
Hey! What's the big idea?

36:01.893 --> 36:03.520
- Mind your business.
- Ah!

36:03.628 --> 36:05.255
No, Moe, what are you... Ooh! Ooh!

36:05.329 --> 36:08.196
Hold still. There you go. There.

36:08.266 --> 36:09.733
Oh!

36:10.701 --> 36:14.432
Now go on over to that information desk
and find out where the hubby's room is.

36:14.972 --> 36:16.132
Hurry.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.669
Let me see that.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.342
Ow!

36:26.484 --> 36:29.180
Excuse me, dreamsicle,
that patient who got hit with a bus,

36:29.287 --> 36:30.652
what room is he in?

36:30.721 --> 36:32.780
That would be 386.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.119
Okay, thank you.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.719
Say! I haven't noticed
you around here before.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.063
I like curvy woman.

36:40.431 --> 36:41.455
Oh!

36:41.532 --> 36:43.227
I bet you say that to all the gals.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.894
What do you say,
me and you go out Saturday night,

36:46.003 --> 36:49.370
grab some falafel and couple of pops? Huh?

36:49.874 --> 36:52.138
Why wait,
when you can have a pop right now?

36:57.315 --> 36:59.044
- How'd you make out?
- Mmm...

36:59.150 --> 37:01.846
I don't know,
I guess we'll find out Saturday night.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.045
- No, I mean with the...
- Look!

37:03.988 --> 37:06.548
Hey! Stop them!

37:09.193 --> 37:10.455
In here.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.627
Doctor?

37:18.169 --> 37:20.364
Excuse me,
may I have a word with these ladies?

37:21.872 --> 37:23.066
Doctor?

37:23.874 --> 37:24.932
Oh!

37:25.676 --> 37:28.509
- Yes, proceed.
- Thank you.

37:28.679 --> 37:32.513
Come on, girls,
let's get these diapers changed A-S-A-P.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.418
The bulldog's still out there.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.692
Well, come on.
Let's blend in till the smoke clears.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.489
But we don't know anything about babies.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.551
What's there to know?

37:45.663 --> 37:47.824
You check under the hood
and if there's a leak,

37:47.898 --> 37:50.389
you change the filter. Come on, get busy.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.163
Ah! Triplicates!

37:54.538 --> 37:56.130
Coochie coochie coo! Coochie coochie coo!

38:01.679 --> 38:02.703
Ugh!

38:02.780 --> 38:05.010
You must be French,
that's a lot of wee-wee.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.575
All right, raise your hand,
who wants to go first?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.685
Fine. You bat lead-off.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.722
Here you go. You like that? We'll fix you up.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.296
Double-crossers, eh?

38:24.669 --> 38:25.693
Oh!

38:28.606 --> 38:31.769
Hiya, boys. Yeah. Now who do we got?

38:38.149 --> 38:41.710
No, Moe! Take it easy!
Let's talk this out. Come on!

38:41.786 --> 38:42.810
Yeah, yeah.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.815
Oh, a pea-shooter, eh?

38:44.922 --> 38:46.913
- Yeah, I'll fix you.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.752
Hey! Where's your hypocritical oath?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.227
Here it is.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.797
That's it. It's on!

39:02.373 --> 39:03.772
Freeze.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.508
Put him down now. Real slow.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.773
Don't do anything stupid.
This one's got a hair-trigger.

39:12.683 --> 39:13.809
Now slide him over.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.148
Any last words?

39:24.795 --> 39:26.160
What is going on...

39:38.008 --> 39:39.703
"386." Come on, this is it.

39:43.581 --> 39:44.639
There he is.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.085
Mongoose, turn on the tube
so nobody hears us.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.519
Chowder-head, start smothering him
while I wedge that door shut.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.821
All right, bed-sores, nap's over.
Time to get you some exercise.

39:58.929 --> 40:03.127
Here we go. There we are.
All right. There we go. Yeah.

40:06.203 --> 40:07.295
Okay.

40:07.371 --> 40:08.633
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

40:08.706 --> 40:10.901
There. Don't go nowhere.

40:16.881 --> 40:18.348
I thought I told you to smother him.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.283
I am, I'm smothering him in onions.

40:21.352 --> 40:24.344
Good thinking, Emeril.
Yeah, let me see that.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.447
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

40:26.524 --> 40:28.253
Look a kitty cat.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.225
<i>Well, it's been a bad week
for Lenny the Lion.</i>

40:33.297 --> 40:36.755
<i>His nasty disposition
has prompted local zoo officials</i>

40:36.867 --> 40:39.893
<i>to put the proud cat
on a short leash inside his pen.</i>

40:39.970 --> 40:43.770
<i>Zoo employees were refusing
to clean the ornery beast's cage</i>

40:43.874 --> 40:46.638
<i>after several recent close calls.</i>

40:52.016 --> 40:53.108
Uh-oh! He's gone!

40:55.753 --> 40:57.687
No, he ain't. He's turtling.

40:57.855 --> 41:00.653
We're going to need to blast.
Mutton-head, you got any dynamite?

41:00.758 --> 41:02.282
There we go.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.692
Fire in the neck hole. Take cover.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.079
Nurse! Nurse!

41:31.422 --> 41:32.719
Nurse, help!

41:32.823 --> 41:35.690
Hey, hey, just relax, pal,
we'll have a toe tag on you in no time.

41:35.759 --> 41:38.523
No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Wait!

41:38.596 --> 41:39.585
Now what?

41:39.697 --> 41:42.165
You don't need to kill me anymore.
I'm cured.

41:42.366 --> 41:45.267
Cured? What are you babbling about,
plaster-boy?

41:45.369 --> 41:49.066
The bus. They say
it knocked the disease right out of me.

41:49.173 --> 41:52.904
The doctors couldn't believe it.
They say it's a miracle.

41:53.544 --> 41:56.069
A miracle! Just our luck.

42:00.084 --> 42:01.517
Quick, hide.

42:09.293 --> 42:11.727
I'm telling you those bums are in here.

42:11.795 --> 42:14.628
This is the room they were looking for.

42:16.433 --> 42:17.525
Psst!

42:33.551 --> 42:34.813
Get them!

42:43.160 --> 42:44.957
Break time, ladies.

42:46.330 --> 42:48.628
Couldrt have come fast enough.

42:53.671 --> 42:55.969
Huddle. Boxcar 45 on three.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.906
Break. One, two, three.

43:07.484 --> 43:08.849
He don't look so good.

43:09.353 --> 43:10.945
Check his pulse.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.586
Nothing.

43:14.658 --> 43:16.489
You mean, he's...

43:16.594 --> 43:19.461
Not on my watch.
Quick, get me the paddles.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.093
Clear!

43:29.506 --> 43:31.997
It's a zombie! Run for your life!

43:35.279 --> 43:36.837
There they are!

43:51.862 --> 43:52.886
Uh...

43:52.963 --> 43:54.897
Fellas, it's too high...

43:56.900 --> 43:59.630
Why, you lame brains!

44:00.304 --> 44:01.771
Hey, look! A fire hose.

44:01.839 --> 44:03.534
We can lower ourselves
down to the ground.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.632
The kid's right. It's foolproof. Come on.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.156
Why don't you
watch where you're going, bud?

44:30.234 --> 44:32.168
I'm sorry. 100% my fault.

44:32.236 --> 44:34.864
Sometimes I just
get lost in my own head and...

44:35.706 --> 44:39.233
Moe? Larry! Curly!

44:39.576 --> 44:41.237
- Is that you?
- Depends who's asking.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.040
It's me, Teddo J. Harter.

44:43.313 --> 44:45.907
- Who?
- Teddy, from the orphanage, Teddy.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.143
You remember, Moe,
I went home with your parents.

44:48.218 --> 44:50.709
What're you trying to pull?
The Teddy we knew was this tall

44:50.821 --> 44:53.517
- and only had one shoe.
- Yeah, and he didn't sound like you.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.217
Here, look.
I've got a snapshot of me and the 'rents

44:57.327 --> 44:58.988
leaving the orphanage.

45:00.397 --> 45:02.262
Hey, it is you!

45:04.601 --> 45:06.535
I was wondering,
how are Moe's folks doing?

45:06.603 --> 45:07.763
They seemed like good eggs.

45:07.871 --> 45:11.602
Dad's doing great.
I work with him at the law firm downtown.

45:12.109 --> 45:14.509
But Mother,
she passed on several years ago.

45:14.578 --> 45:15.602
Hunting accident.

45:15.913 --> 45:17.540
- Oh, sure.
- Oh, yeah.

45:17.614 --> 45:20.048
So, you boys on Facebook? I'll poke you.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.948
- Better yet, I'll tweet you.
- Ah!

45:22.019 --> 45:23.543
Tweet us to dinner? Certainly.

45:23.620 --> 45:25.952
Hey, wait a minute,
where are you guys living?

45:26.056 --> 45:27.785
- You know the Ritz-Carlton on Oak Street?
- Oh, sure.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.791
Yeah, we're camped out
in the dumpster out back.

45:30.094 --> 45:34.030
But not the dirty, beat-up green one,
it's the shiny blue one right next to it.

45:34.164 --> 45:35.222
Oh!

45:35.899 --> 45:37.628
You know, I've got an idea.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.726
Why don't you guys
come crash at my place?

45:39.803 --> 45:41.600
Just until
you get your feet back on the ground.

45:41.772 --> 45:45.037
- Oh, boy! That sounds terrific.
- We're not going anywhere.

45:45.375 --> 45:47.570
What are you talking about, Moe?

45:47.678 --> 45:49.737
Thanks, Teddy bear,
but we're going to stay put.

45:49.847 --> 45:51.712
We got too many irons in the fire right now.

45:51.782 --> 45:53.249
Of course you do.

45:53.350 --> 45:55.841
Hey, look, I got to get going,
I'm supposed to be visiting a friend.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.784
Wait. Let's get a quick pic first.

45:58.188 --> 45:59.883
- What is that gadget?
- This is an iPhone.

45:59.957 --> 46:01.049
Eye-phone?

46:01.125 --> 46:04.094
Hello? Hello? There's nobody there.

46:04.194 --> 46:06.424
It works better on your ear.
Here, come on everybody.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.895
- Where do you think you're going?
- Here, let me get...

46:09.967 --> 46:11.229
Smile.

46:13.303 --> 46:16.534
That's great.
It's so good to see you guys, really.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.939
You haven't changed a bit.

46:23.413 --> 46:25.745
You got rocks in your head?
Teddy was trying to help us out

46:25.816 --> 46:27.215
and you blew him off. What gives?

46:27.284 --> 46:28.478
We'll help ourselves out.

46:28.652 --> 46:30.984
Well, what about the orphanage?
Teddy's dad has dough.

46:31.088 --> 46:33.420
Maybe he would've given us
the 800,000 bucks.

46:33.490 --> 46:35.253
We don't need handouts from that chump.

46:35.325 --> 46:36.917
We told those kids
we'd come up with the cash

46:36.994 --> 46:38.222
and that's just what we're going to do.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.660
Yeah, how?

46:40.831 --> 46:44.096
Well, we still got that seed money,
don't we?

46:44.168 --> 46:46.762
- Seed money?
- The cash Mother Superior gave us.

46:47.671 --> 46:49.571
This 72 bucks is our ticket to riches.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.665
Riches! How do you figure?

46:52.242 --> 46:54.904
Well, it's seed money, right?
What do you do with seeds?

46:54.978 --> 46:56.411
Spit them out.

46:56.847 --> 46:59.179
You plant them. We'll become farmers.

46:59.516 --> 47:02.076
Farmers? I always wanted to be a farmer.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.616
- To the farm.
- To the farm.

47:03.687 --> 47:04.676
To the farm.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.984
<i>A farming we will go</i>

47:08.826 --> 47:10.316
<i>A farming we will go</i>

47:10.427 --> 47:13.330
<i>A farming we will go
A farming we will go</i>

47:13.530 --> 47:15.430
Lydia, you won't believe who I saw today.

47:15.499 --> 47:16.625
Huh?

47:16.700 --> 47:19.100
I said,
you won't believe who I ran into today.

47:19.169 --> 47:22.104
I can't hear you, honey,
what are you saying?

47:22.172 --> 47:24.197
When I visited Mac at the hospital today,

47:24.441 --> 47:27.137
I wasrt paying attention and I literally

47:27.211 --> 47:31.011
ran into these three guys
I haven't seen since I was a kid.

47:31.114 --> 47:32.809
Yeah, that's nice.

47:35.285 --> 47:36.775
Are you okay, pudding?

47:37.321 --> 47:38.720
I'm fine.

47:38.822 --> 47:42.280
Anyway, I'm thinking of inviting them
to our anniversary party.

47:44.294 --> 47:46.489
Yeah,
they look like they're a lot of fun.

47:52.102 --> 47:54.127
Here's a little drink for you, Elsie.

47:54.671 --> 47:58.198
Jonesie, you have to hold still
in order to get a drink.

48:01.478 --> 48:04.845
Hello, Maritza,
you're getting your color back.

48:08.652 --> 48:09.949
Ralphie don't look so good.

48:10.020 --> 48:11.214
Poor guy's drying out.

48:11.321 --> 48:14.154
Oh! Good for you, Ralphie, realizing
there's a problem is half the battle.

48:14.858 --> 48:16.519
Hey, look, our first customer.

48:24.201 --> 48:25.190
What are you doing?

48:25.302 --> 48:28.703
Only selling the finest farm-raised salmon
in the county, that's all.

48:28.805 --> 48:30.830
Yeah, they're all free-range.
No nets, no cages.

48:31.008 --> 48:32.373
They can go wherever they want.

48:32.476 --> 48:34.569
Plus we have smoked salmon.

48:35.712 --> 48:37.839
But this is a golf course.

48:38.548 --> 48:40.709
So what? We let them play through.

48:40.817 --> 48:43.342
- What's your beef?
- Yeah, we're trying to save an orphanage.

48:43.420 --> 48:46.150
Look, are you here to buy fish
or are you just kicking the tires?

48:47.991 --> 48:50.653
Hey! Do your job. Can't path only.

48:50.727 --> 48:52.922
I'll can't path you, you little...

48:55.198 --> 48:57.223
It's the 5-0! Scram!

48:58.001 --> 48:59.434
You again!

49:02.572 --> 49:03.766
Oh, my back!

49:08.845 --> 49:10.039
Stop right there.

49:13.083 --> 49:14.072
Got you!

49:15.352 --> 49:16.341
Hold still.

49:23.894 --> 49:27.762
What's a matter with you? Come on, you.

49:31.301 --> 49:33.599
Yah! Yah, mule! Yah!

49:42.946 --> 49:46.473
Whoa! Easy, Seabiscuit, easy.

49:49.319 --> 49:50.581
We're trapped like rats.

49:50.654 --> 49:52.588
Speak for yourself, rodent.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.888
We're going to need a battering ram.

49:57.794 --> 49:59.625
- You go that way. I'll go this way.
- Okay.

50:02.399 --> 50:03.957
Heave-Ho!

50:04.034 --> 50:05.365
Heave-ho!

50:05.435 --> 50:07.995
Oh! Fellas, ease up,
you're squeezing my ankles too tight.

50:08.071 --> 50:09.504
Quit your whining.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.429
Ho!

50:19.049 --> 50:20.243
That was a close one.

50:20.317 --> 50:21.477
What is that? What's with the light?

50:21.885 --> 50:23.648
I got a better question,

50:23.754 --> 50:26.120
why didn't we go live with Teddy
when we had the chance?

50:26.289 --> 50:29.156
Now we got no Teddy,
no seed money, no nothing.

50:29.259 --> 50:32.387
Yeah, shame on you, Moe.
You put your pride ahead of them kids.

50:32.462 --> 50:34.930
How dare you accuse me of having pride!

50:36.066 --> 50:37.328
Back off.

50:37.968 --> 50:39.230
I won't.

50:41.438 --> 50:43.269
Okay, kid, you got me.

50:43.807 --> 50:46.367
You know, I'm proud of you
for finally standing up for yourself.

50:46.443 --> 50:48.240
Let's shake on it. There you go.

50:48.311 --> 50:49.539
Get out of here.

50:49.613 --> 50:51.080
- This is all your fault.
- Me?

50:53.050 --> 50:54.779
Sneaking up on me, eh? And you.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.546
Get over here.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.722
What's a matter with you?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

51:03.060 --> 51:04.493
Why you...

51:05.095 --> 51:06.926
Moe, not that! Anything but that!

51:08.999 --> 51:10.330
Why you! There you go!

51:12.502 --> 51:13.969
There you go.

51:15.338 --> 51:16.498
Get up there!

51:28.518 --> 51:29.849
All right.

51:32.856 --> 51:33.845
Why you!

51:33.957 --> 51:36.790
Stop it! Stop it, Moe! I've had it with you.

51:36.860 --> 51:39.988
You are the cause of all of our problems
since day one.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.587
How do you figure?

51:42.632 --> 51:44.327
You should have gone and lived
with Teddy's folks

51:44.434 --> 51:45.799
back when they wanted to adopt you.

51:45.869 --> 51:47.803
That way you could have come back
and helped us all out.

51:47.871 --> 51:51.705
But no! The great and powerful Moe
is too lazy to squeegee the pool.

51:53.310 --> 51:54.675
You don't know what you're talking about.

51:54.778 --> 51:55.767
Oh, no?

51:55.846 --> 51:57.370
Why do you think
we never got another shot

51:57.481 --> 51:58.846
at getting adopted again?

51:58.949 --> 52:00.780
It's because
when you messed it up that day,

52:00.851 --> 52:02.648
you messed it up for all of us.

52:06.389 --> 52:09.119
If you two got ants in your pants,
then why don't you just leave?

52:09.192 --> 52:11.990
I'm getting sick and tired
of looking at your monkey-faces anyhow.

52:12.162 --> 52:15.893
Being with you two is like dragging around
a couple of boat anchors.

52:21.071 --> 52:22.368
Well, fine.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.001
Then...

52:27.911 --> 52:29.310
Goodbye, Moe.

52:29.646 --> 52:31.580
Yeah. Goodbye.

52:32.582 --> 52:35.050
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go on, scram!

52:35.152 --> 52:37.848
I bet you two earthworms
won't last a day without me.

52:40.223 --> 52:41.212
Hmph!

53:14.090 --> 53:16.991
Bravo. Brilliant. Just brilliant.

53:17.527 --> 53:20.587
What an original way to showcase
your personality. By putting on a skit.

53:20.697 --> 53:22.494
- Very smart.
- Huh?

53:22.566 --> 53:24.261
That is exactly what we're looking for.

53:24.434 --> 53:26.231
Someone who's not afraid of confrontation.

53:26.403 --> 53:28.371
Who's passionate about his opinions,
right or wrong.

53:28.438 --> 53:30.167
That's what America craves.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.571
What are you flapping about?

53:31.675 --> 53:32.869
Oh! He's beautiful.

53:33.510 --> 53:34.875
Congratulations, sir,

53:34.945 --> 53:36.845
you are the newest cast member

53:36.913 --> 53:39.279
of the world's number-one-rated
reality show.

53:55.098 --> 53:57.430
90% off all our treats, folks.

53:57.534 --> 53:59.968
We got chocolate, vanilla, strawberry.

54:00.036 --> 54:01.936
No reasonable offer will be refused.

54:02.038 --> 54:04.472
It's remarkable, it's refreshing.

54:05.709 --> 54:07.233
It's repulsive.

54:07.944 --> 54:09.036
What was that for?

54:09.112 --> 54:11.273
I told you we'd need more ice.

54:11.381 --> 54:13.975
Hey, look, a zoo. What do you say
we go in and chisel a lunch?

54:14.084 --> 54:15.984
All right.

54:16.052 --> 54:19.488
What are you waiting for?
Just go in there and do it.

54:19.589 --> 54:22.319
<i>What are you crazy, el pollo loco,
in the head?</i>

54:22.425 --> 54:24.655
I can't just walk in the main gates
and shoot them.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.924
There's people in there. There's protesters.
There's cameras everywhere.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.692
Okay, just give me the gun
and I'll do it myself.

54:30.767 --> 54:31.791
Why do you gotta do that, huh?

54:31.868 --> 54:33.699
Why do you gotta turn everything
into me being a weakling?

54:33.770 --> 54:35.567
I'm not being weak.

54:35.739 --> 54:37.138
I'm being smart.

54:37.407 --> 54:38.738
Oh, yeah.

54:39.109 --> 54:41.942
The polar bear is found
mainly in the Arctic Circle

54:42.045 --> 54:43.637
and the adjacent land masses

54:43.747 --> 54:45.772
as far south as Newfoundland island.

54:45.882 --> 54:49.545
The male bear you're looking at
weighs over 1,000 pounds

54:49.619 --> 54:51.246
and can become quite aggressive.

54:51.488 --> 54:55.925
When hungry, these bears devour
large amounts of food rapidly.

54:56.259 --> 54:58.784
Despite its fluffy fur and teddy-bear look

54:58.895 --> 55:01.090
the polar bear is actually

55:01.164 --> 55:04.258
one of the most ruthless,
predatory carnivores on the planet.

55:06.636 --> 55:08.228
I'm worried about Moe.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.829
You and me, we're survivors,

55:09.939 --> 55:13.340
but Moe, I ain't sure
he's got the right social skills.

55:13.443 --> 55:15.104
Yeah, I'm worried, too.

55:15.178 --> 55:17.339
I don't know
how he's going to fit in out there.

55:17.647 --> 55:20.775
Just look at his haircut.
People must think he's insane.

55:20.850 --> 55:21.839
Yeah.

55:22.185 --> 55:23.675
Wait, wait.

55:24.754 --> 55:26.312
Give me a boost.

55:36.966 --> 55:38.524
No!

55:39.169 --> 55:41.660
Hold on, don't push!

55:43.039 --> 55:44.438
And hurry up!

56:02.559 --> 56:04.049
Penguins?

56:06.529 --> 56:07.791
No?

56:17.307 --> 56:18.672
Good kitty.

56:21.711 --> 56:23.372
I have a gun.

56:24.381 --> 56:25.507
Don't make me use it.

56:41.831 --> 56:43.765
Hey, little fella, you want a peanut?

56:45.602 --> 56:47.866
Dolphins love peanuts, you know.

56:47.937 --> 56:49.666
Here you go. Catch.

56:54.177 --> 56:56.008
Oh, my God! I think he's snufficating.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.547
Don't worry, pal,
I know the Heineken maneuver.

57:01.551 --> 57:02.779
Yeah.

57:05.121 --> 57:06.281
It ain't working.

57:06.389 --> 57:07.583
I'm coming.

57:10.727 --> 57:12.718
You're doing it wrong. Get out of the way.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.895
I thought I saw a pussy cat.

57:16.966 --> 57:18.399
I did. I did.

57:21.471 --> 57:24.235
Come on. Come on. Come on, boy.

57:24.307 --> 57:26.207
Who's king of the forest now?

57:48.331 --> 57:50.424
<i>The five times...
You paid...</i>

57:50.500 --> 57:53.492
<i>Get crazy, get wild
Let's party, get loud</i>

57:53.570 --> 57:54.559
<i>If you wanna have fun...</i>

57:54.637 --> 57:56.502
Have you ever seen this show?

57:56.573 --> 57:57.597
Hmm?

57:57.674 --> 57:58.663
No.

57:58.775 --> 57:59.764
It's a hoot.

57:59.843 --> 58:01.140
<i>Let's party get loud</i>

58:01.211 --> 58:04.669
<i>If you wanna have fun and do something
If you wanna have fun and do something</i>

58:04.747 --> 58:06.305
<i>Get crazy get wild</i>

58:06.816 --> 58:08.181
What the...

58:08.985 --> 58:10.350
That's him.

58:11.087 --> 58:12.247
That's who, dear?

58:12.322 --> 58:14.415
That's Moe! He's on TV!

58:18.561 --> 58:20.756
<i>- How's that Whynatte?
- That is my fourth or fifth.</i>

58:20.830 --> 58:22.991
<i>- What kind of flavor?
- I like coffee, too.</i>

58:25.301 --> 58:27.826
<i>Hey, I'm heading out to 7-Eleven,
anyone up for some gummy worms?</i>

58:27.937 --> 58:30.599
<i>Yeah, maybe if they were soaked in vodka.</i>

58:30.673 --> 58:33.141
<i>By the way, why are you even on our show?</i>

58:33.243 --> 58:35.108
<i>You look like a stretched-out meatball.</i>

58:35.178 --> 58:37.703
<i>Did not Moe tell you
that he's using our little program</i>

58:37.780 --> 58:42.342
<i>as a launching pad to make a lot of paper
to save homeless orphan babies?</i>

58:42.452 --> 58:45.182
<i>Good luck. This guy can't even
buy the right kind of grated cheese.</i>

58:45.288 --> 58:48.018
<i>I asked for Romano, not Parmesan,
you mook.</i>

58:48.124 --> 58:49.785
<i>- Oh! You don't like that cheese.
- No.</i>

58:49.859 --> 58:51.292
<i>Let's see what we can do about that.</i>

58:51.361 --> 58:52.658
Oh, boy. Here we go.

58:52.762 --> 58:56.027
<i>How about some aged cheddar,
tough guy. Come on.</i>

58:56.132 --> 58:57.599
<i>What are you, crazy? That's assault.</i>

58:57.667 --> 58:58.929
<i>Here's your pepper. Shut up.</i>

58:59.002 --> 59:00.833
<i>- My man!
Who asked you, muscle-head?</i>

59:00.937 --> 59:03.303
<i>Moe! You can't just
go around hitting people!</i>

59:03.373 --> 59:05.000
<i>- No, well, can I do this?
- Ow!</i>

59:05.108 --> 59:06.336
<i>Hmm... Rare bouquet.</i>

59:07.810 --> 59:10.438
<i>Are you kidding me? Who does this?</i>

59:11.481 --> 59:13.642
Need some help, folks,
looking for our missing friend.

59:13.716 --> 59:16.708
$3.50 reward. Dead or alive.

59:16.819 --> 59:18.218
Here you are, pal, we're missing our pal.

59:18.788 --> 59:22.053
Hey, get over there and staple up
the rest of these flyers on the pronto.

59:29.098 --> 59:33.296
Aah! Thanks a lot, buddy,
now I got a hole in my head.

59:35.471 --> 59:37.029
Quit screwing with the public.

59:37.507 --> 59:40.169
Cut it out!
Who do you think you are, huh?

59:40.243 --> 59:41.301
Oh, I see.

59:41.377 --> 59:42.674
When Moe slugs you, it's okay,

59:42.745 --> 59:44.576
but when Larry does it,
it's not good enough.

59:44.681 --> 59:46.876
No, no, no, Larry, it's good enough,
it's just that...

59:46.983 --> 59:48.075
You're not doing it right.

59:48.184 --> 59:50.846
When Moe hits me,
it's just better, you know?

59:50.920 --> 59:53.320
You got rocks in your head.
I'm hitting you just the same.

59:53.389 --> 59:55.914
No, you're not. You do this.

59:55.992 --> 59:57.619
And Moe does this.

59:57.694 --> 59:59.321
And Moe doesn't do this.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.521
He does this.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:01.723
You see?

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.589
Ah, you're right.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.997
Come on, think.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.400
Where would we go if we was Moe?

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.499
Home.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.738
Home.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.173
Yeah.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:25.281
<i>Lord, I feel like going home</i>

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.287
Where is everybody?

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:38.324
<i>I've tried and I failed and I'm tired and weary</i>

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.033
Hello?

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.731
Anybody home?

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:49.936
<i>Hi, I'm Al Cerrone,
four-wheel drive SUVs just like this,</i>

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:52.241
<i>with a gas-saving, six-cylinder engine,</i>

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:53.714
<i>only $19,995.</i>

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:57.810
<i>And pick-ups, automatic and air,
only $16,000.</i>

01:00:58.721 --> 01:00:59.881
Sister Ricarda.

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:04.992
Boys, what are you doing here?

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.324
We've been looking everywhere for Moe.
Have you seen him?

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.957
Yeah. I see him almost every night on TV.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.962
He's on that Jersey beach-people show.

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:17.064
You didn't know?

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.835
Moe's a big celebrity now.

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:19.932
Oh!

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.343
Good for him.

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.073
Yeah.

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:27.509
Looks like he didn't need us after all.

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.443
So what happened here?
Where are all the kids?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.115
They're closing us down on Monday,

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.126
so we had to start moving everyone out.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.093
But we told you to wait.
We were going to get the money.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.254
You got the money?

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.660
We got the money?

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.095
Well, no,

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.395
but we're working on it.

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:46.457
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.527
At least you tried.

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.201
- Peez!
- Peez!

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.838
Thank God you're still here.

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.378
They tried to shoo me out,

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.641
but I told them
I wasrt leaving without her.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.110
Without who?

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.513
Murph?

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:12.627
I'm sorry, boys, Murph is very ill.

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.520
Why isn't she in a hospital?

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.655
Well...

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.564
I'll tell you why.

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:21.292
Because we don't have
any medical insurance.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:25.238
You should get some.
Just call that little green alligator guy.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:28.504
Okay, that's it. I've had it with you.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.672
Do you want to know why
we have no medical insurance?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.206
It's because you wombats have caused
so many accidents over the years,

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:37.513
there's not a company on this earth
that will cover us

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:41.921
until we pay the $830,000
we owe for previous claims.

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.492
And that's why we're being closed down.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.720
That's enough, Sister.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:48.558
Wait. You mean the orphanage is closing

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.260
because of us?

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:56.396
Check it out, Larry, Curly,

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.439
you're responsible for that.

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.409
You are and that other moron.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:06.972
Oh!

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.852
Sorry, excuse me.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.681
Yes?

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:15.018
No, no, I want it with custard
not whipped cream.

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.457
I ordered an éclair not a Twinkie.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:30.197
<i>You know it's funny how freedom
can make us feel contained</i>

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.599
<i>Is that what you think? Shut up.</i>

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.371
<i>- Hey, Moe!
- You, too. Here's another one.</i>

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.316
<i>Hiya, Snook, I got you a present.</i>

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.751
<i>Really? For me?</i>

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.756
<i>- Yeah, go on, open it.
- Okay.</i>

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.418
Ow!

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:53.121
<i>I'll just wait here
and listen to you when you speak</i>

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:54.322
<i>Or scream</i>

01:03:54.397 --> 01:04:01.326
<i>And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can</i>

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:05.204
<i>And every day that you want to wake up...</i>

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.242
Why you...

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.743
Now, there you go.

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:12.878
<i>And every day that you want to waste...</i>

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.917
<i>Why you...</i>

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.177
<i>You see that?</i>

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:20.747
<i>You see that?</i>

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:21.812
Business!

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.318
Why you...

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.760
<i>Why you...</i>

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:36.237
<i>And every day that you want to waste...</i>

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.457
Kickham, Harter and Indagroyne,
may I help you?

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.653
Yes, I'll connect you now.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.959
Oh! I'm sorry, sir,

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:05.057
but the clown college is on the ninth floor.

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:09.004
Oh, no, I'm here to see Teddy Harter.

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:11.562
Tell him it's his old pal, Larry,
from the orphanage.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.198
Oh, Teddo's not here.

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:16.142
He's out making arrangements
for his anniversary party.

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:18.339
All right, then can I speak to his old man?

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.644
Mr. Harter is at lunch,
but he should be back soon.

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.174
- Nice glasses.
- Thank you.

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.914
You got a little spot there.
Let me help you out.

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.487
Here you are. Good as new.

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:36.088
By the way, do not lick those.
I am just getting over pink eye.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.758
Mr. Harter.

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:40.858
Just the guy I wanted to see.

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:44.438
I'll take the case. Please tell me
it was Supercuts who did this to you.

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.936
No, it's me, Larry.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:49.102
Moe, Larry, Curly, remember?

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.040
From the orphanage.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.044
Oh, my goodness.

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.209
Congratulations, you're still in remission.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.784
So, what brings you here?

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:00.947
Look, I'll cut to the chase, moneybags.
We're in a jam.

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:03.787
The orphanage needs $830,000,
or it's going belly up.

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.691
Plus, we got a sick kid
getting fitted for angel wings.

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.855
Terrific, so who do we sue?

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.523
Oh, no, there's no one to sue.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.692
- We need you to give us the money.
- Yeah.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.967
But we're not looking
for a handout, mind you.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:17.731
We'll work off every last penny
right here in these halls.

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:22.469
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm committed
to several other charities,

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:25.445
and besides, I don't have
that kind of money just laying around,

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:28.449
but if you decide to sue the orphanage,
I'm in.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:29.916
Mr. H, please...

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.079
I know what you're thinking,
that we're both lazy bums like Moe,

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.143
but we're not.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.749
Some of us aren't afraid
to get our hands dirty.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.952
What? No. I never thought of Moe as lazy.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.220
It's all right.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:42.230
That slug told us the whole story
about why you dropped him back off.

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:44.766
Well, I can assure you it had
nothing to do with his work ethic.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:45.960
He was 10.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:49.834
No, what happened was, he wanted us
to go back for you two,

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.669
and frankly it was just too much for us.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.667
Wait. You mean

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.679
he wouldn't go without us?

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:00.340
No, he wouldn't.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:04.476
He was very adamant about wanting us
to adopt all three of you

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.751
and it was just out of the question,
you understand.

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:10.087
Anywho, gotta skedaddle.
Late for a meeting.

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.457
But if you ever do want to sue anyone
for anything,

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.587
a slip in the tub, a bone in the fish,

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:16.028
I'm your guy.

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:24.633
Hey.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.477
Who's this lady?

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:31.340
That's Teddo's wife, Lydia.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.208
Teddy's wife?

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.373
Yup.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:37.208
She's one lucky girl.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.017
Then who's the guy on the end?

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.386
Oh! That's Teddo's best friend, Mac.

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:46.519
Then who's Mister Fancy Pants
in the top hat and scarf?

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.629
That's a snowman.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.159
Yeah, but what's his name?

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:53.360
Yeah.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.671
Now look, either you kick Moe off the show

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.140
or we're suing him!

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:01.801
Like, with a lawyer.

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.037
Court sounds okay to me.

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:05.340
<i>You know, we could probably do
a cross-promotion with Lockup.</i>

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:06.540
SNOOKl: Great, just great.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:10.710
So basically what you're saying
is this whole show is all about the ratings?

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:12.985
Uh... Yeah.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.246
Unbelievable.

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:18.760
Just because she's wearing a genius hat
doesn't mean she is one.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.586
Hey!

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:24.826
Onion-head. Porcupine!

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.228
- Oh, fellas.
Moe!

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:27.926
Sorry, boss, I couldn't stop them.

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:30.267
It's all right, Johnnie,
you're good, you're good.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.169
Look, Moe, we owe you an apology.

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:34.709
No, fellas, I'm the one
who owes you the apology.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.768
I know sometimes
I tend to fly off the handle.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.437
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:40.606
No, it's just that
you get a little upset and you...

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.046
Shut up when I'm apologizing.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.948
We don't have time for that.
Teddy's in a jam.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:46.283
You know that woman
who wanted us to take out her husband?

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:47.548
She's married to Teddy.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:50.589
No wonder she wanted us
to smother him in his sleep.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:51.919
I knew I smelled a...

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:53.517
A rat!

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:56.624
That's no rat. It's Nippy.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:59.029
How you doing, buddy?
I missed you, too, Nipps.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.693
Come on, we got work to do.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:02.600
We got to get to Teddy
before his wife does.

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:03.899
Come on.

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:08.064
Come on, Romeo.

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:10.134
Are you kidding me?

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.148
There's three of them?

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:16.015
I don't get you, Lydia.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:18.144
Why would you throw
a big anniversary party for Teddo?

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.085
- I thought we were trying to kill the guy.
- We are.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.589
I just want lots of witnesses

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:26.094
for when that dope accidently falls
head first from the balcony.

01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:27.888
Oh!

01:09:27.962 --> 01:09:29.157
Well,

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.630
you two are certainly looking rather cozy.

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:36.432
Good Lord, Mac,
what happened to your face?

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.631
New kitty.

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:41.269
I'm going to go and freshen up my drink.

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:42.776
Okay.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.939
Mrs. Harter, may we please go upstairs
and play in Teddo's game room?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.176
No. You can't go upstairs.

01:09:48.283 --> 01:09:51.048
Teddo is busy entertaining
some of my bridge club friends.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.051
Go! Play with the balloons.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:56.215
But my stupid brother popped
all the balloons. This is the last one.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.825
We can get more balloons.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.684
Carol, go get more balloons.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.160
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.354
Madam. Madam.

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.066
Sir, madam.

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.709
No! No!

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:27.381
Now, we got to... Whoa! Whoa!

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.489
What's a matter with you?
You had the rudder.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.650
Don't you know how to drive?

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.353
It just went out of control.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.758
- What kind of poodles are those anyway?
- Standard.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.354
There's your problem.
I can't drive a standard.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.368
You blithering idiots.
What do you think you're doing?

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:43.027
Out of the way, 3PO, we gotta get Teddy.

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:44.670
Ow!

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.538
This is an invitation-only party.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.237
Now, good day!

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.346
Great, now what are we going to do?

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.181
Pierre. Send those balloon men in
as soon as they get here.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.243
Will do.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.686
That's our cue, boys. Come on.

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.461
Balloon men coming through.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:10.625
Out of our way, these things are heavy.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:16.068
There you go, crusher.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:22.336
I don't see him anywhere.
I smell lobster.

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:25.173
Okay you two,
now spread out and look for Teddy.

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:27.147
And remember,
a mars life is at stake here.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:33.313
- Ah! Here you are, short stack.
- Thanks, mister.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:44.656
Ah!

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.598
You're up, pal.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:49.728
No thanks. My, that's an interesting

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:50.862
haircut.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.271
Ah! Thanks, but it's not without some help.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.741
I have a great deal of product in there.

01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:00.375
Hey! Where are your manners?

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.780
Attaboy.

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:06.379
Mmm.

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:12.951
Ah!

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:16.093
- How's the dip?
- Here try it for yourself.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:19.825
Mmm.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:22.871
Aspen is so yesterday.

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:25.805
This season
we're thinking of going to Banff.

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:28.035
Hey, JumboTron,
you seen Teddy anywhere?

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.772
No, I haven't. How rude.

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:42.352
Pardon me.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:45.120
- What are you grub worms doing?
- Getting seconds on lobster.

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:47.422
Seconds? I thought lobster
upset your stomach.

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:49.520
I dipped it in pesto-bismol.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:50.963
Oh! You like dipping, eh? Come here.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.468
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.441
Look, it's Santy Claws. Claws!

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.101
What did I tell you about puns?

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:20.650
- Ooh!
- Ah!

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:24.497
Excuse me, I go.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.091
What are you, trying to
get us thrown out of here? I'll fix you.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.501
No, Moe, no, where is your dignity?

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.775
Hold still, mister, I'll get it.

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.446
One second.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.941
Those three idiots are here.

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.918
The Kardashian girls? Where are they?

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:47.854
The three bums. They crashed the party.

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:51.521
Oh, God! We got to get them out of here
before they ruin everything.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.459
<i>Madame!</i>

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.460
May I present to you my masterpiece.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:59.467
Oh, yes!

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:01.765
Somebody, help her!

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.429
Mommy!

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.335
Think of something, lame brains.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.536
Hey, look. A balloon popper.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:13.940
I'll get it.

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:16.109
What's the matter with you?
That's a kid up there.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.584
Where's your gun safety?

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.589
That was awesome!

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:29.623
No!

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.259
<i>Mon gâteau!</i>

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.428
Come on, fellas. Pardon me.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.124
Hey, fellas, wait up!

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:06.861
Come on.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:09.899
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy,
what's the matter?

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:12.064
- Come on, boy, speak to me.
- Who are you?

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.300
- It's us, it's Moe...
- Larry.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.569
And Curly.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.236
Guys? What are you doing here?

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.870
All right, buddy, we got you now.

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.315
Hey, Mac. Oh, honey,

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:25.376
thanks so much
for inviting the boys behind my back.

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.250
That ain't the only thing
she's doing behind your back.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.051
Yeah, she wanted us to
smother you in your sleep.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.421
And now it looks like
she slipped you some knock-out juice.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:34.061
Lydia, what are they talking about?

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:37.063
Honey, I am as confused as you are.

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.531
All I know
is that these men crashed our party,

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:42.434
and when we tried to remove them,
they start acting crazy.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.836
Teddy, you've known us
since you were a baby.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.034
Why, we were the ones who taught you
how to play with matches.

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:50.545
We treated you like a little brother.
Why would we lie to you now?

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:52.603
Wait, Lydia...

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:56.173
Why am I still in bed
if the party's going on?

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.054
I'll tell you why.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.448
Oh, Mac...

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.687
Don't even think about it, Mac.

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.590
Real slow now, drop it to the floor.

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:12.024
Not a problem.

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:15.694
Good work, Dad.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:20.205
I had a feeling something was going on.
But you, Mac?

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.902
I mean, you were my best pal!
Why would you do that?

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:28.742
It wasrt my idea.
She was calling the shots. I swear.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.312
No, Mac,

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.945
I was calling the shots.

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:47.097
I suggest we finish this discussion
in a more secluded place

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.830
so as not to ruin the party.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:52.304
Yes, after all it is my anniversary.

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:54.001
Ouch.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:59.470
I don't get it.
Why did it have to come to this, Dad?

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:03.574
Well, son, I didn't get rich
simply by lawyering.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.117
I married into it.

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:08.588
Unfortunately, when your mom
passed away,

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.249
she left everything to you.

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:13.019
So you were just using me
to do your dirty work.

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:15.596
Oh, you cracked the code.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.400
What's so funny, Butterbean?

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.993
Nothing, Nippy's whiskers are tickling me.

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.197
Who's Nippy?

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:25.562
Him.

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:34.838
Take it out!

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:40.987
Open the door!

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.748
Shoot the window out!

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.258
No! It's wet!

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.828
Why would you let the gun get wet?

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.159
<i>When possible, make a legal U-turn.</i>

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:01.102
How long will the air last?

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:04.201
Maybe five minutes if we stay calm.

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.906
We gotta break a window.

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.038
It's impossible.

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:09.606
There's 1,000 pounds of water
pressing against that glass.

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:13.017
Great, great!
How could this possibly get any worse?

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:23.028
I'm sorry, I guess the pesto-bismol
didn't help with the lobster.

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.588
Did you eat the shells again?

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.601
I don't know.
It was on the plate and then it wasrt.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.365
Wait a minute! Does anyone have a lighter?

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.304
No.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:36.777
All I got are these stupid, easy-light,
waterproof safety matches.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.709
Why you... Give me that!

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:42.472
- Everybody close your eyes!
- Maybe that's not such a...

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.461
Come on, come on,
what's it gonna take, huh?

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.002
Come on, what's it gonna take?
Let's make a deal.

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.469
Shut up!
- You shut up.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.836
I'll sing like a canary.
You name them, I'll blame them.

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:07.408
I don't care.

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:09.910
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:13.141
Here I am, the so-called lucky one
who got adopted

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:16.115
and yet I never could find the one thing
that you three have always had.

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:20.318
You're happy with yourselves
and with each other. That's a real blessing.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.652
So what can I do
to pay you guys back for saving my life?

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:24.758
Funny you should ask.

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:28.489
Can you give us 830,000 bucks
to save the orphanage?

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.324
No.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.264
That guy that adopted me?

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:39.102
He shipped me off to military school
when I was seven.

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:43.270
And then he just tried to murder me
and run off with my wife.

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:45.279
And you expect me to just give money

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:48.180
to the women
who handed me over to that monster?

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:52.749
I'm sorry, guys, I would do anything
for those kids and you guys,

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:55.718
but I can't do that.

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.257
I'm sorry.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.794
Excuse me, Mr. Harter, could you
come over here and give us a statement?

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:01.988
Yeah.

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:04.391
Right this way.

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:12.137
Donut remover!

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:17.474
<i>When you're lost
in the rain in Juarez</i>

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:20.276
<i>And it's Easter time, too</i>

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:29.647
<i>And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through</i>

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.826
<i>Don't put on any airs...</i>

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:39.222
We sure botched this one pretty good.

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.195
What else is new?

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:46.431
I wonder what happened to Murph
and Peez and the rest of the gang.

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:49.604
I sure do miss those guys.

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:53.771
Why it's almost like I can still hear
the sweet childhood sounds of laughter

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.144
and swimming and tennis.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.581
I know what you mean.

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:59.414
Wait a minute,
we didn't have swimming and tennis.

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:00.715
And we didn't have laughter.

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.154
Hey, fellas, look!

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:04.614
Yes!

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:30.683
When you got nine teammates,
you gotta pass it. You gotta pass it.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.117
Sister Bernice?

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:43.761
That's it!
I told you one at a time on that board.

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:47.700
You all just lost your diving privileges
for the rest of the day!

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:50.794
The party's over, you little water weasels!

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.599
What's going on here?

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:55.866
Oh, crud!

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:57.808
Come on.

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:03.247
- Hiya, Sister.
- Hello, morons.

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.616
Hey! Moe, Larry, Curly!

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:06.847
Hey, guys.

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.354
- Hey, what's going on?
- How are you guys? Hey!

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.855
Oh, boy, did we miss you, guys!

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.426
- Welcome home, guys.
- You look great, Murph.

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.485
That's because she's not sick anymore.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:17.258
It turns out
I just had some form of metal poisoning.

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:19.625
Nobody listens to me.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:22.329
I told you
there's too much iron in the water.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:26.771
Boys! Where have you been?
We've been looking for you everywhere.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:31.434
Well, I guess we just didn't have the nerve
to come back and tell you

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.673
we failed.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:35.113
You didn't fail! Look at our new home!

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:37.683
New home? Who paid for all this?

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:38.775
You did!

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:39.911
Huh?

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:42.786
The kid's right.
The money's coming out of your pocket.

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:45.284
Sorry, slick,
but we don't have that kind of dough.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.349
Oh, you will.

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.124
See, the network has taken the liberty
of paying off the orphanage's debts

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:51.893
and building the new complex.
Think of it as an advance.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.161
All's you gotta do is sign right here, boys.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:56.999
And you three will be the stars
of our next big reality show,

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:59.370
<i>Nuns Versus Nitwits. What do you say?</i>

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:01.206
Oh, gee!

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.710
I always wanted to be a nun.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:07.179
<i>Oh! And by the way, the Jersey Shore kids
pitched in for the down payment.</i>

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.545
Hey, everybody.

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.880
- Oh! Hey, Teddy.
- Hi, Teddy.

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:16.551
Gather round, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:21.725
Teddy and his fiancée, Ling,

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:25.891
have just discovered that
our Lord and Savior has left her barren.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.866
So they have decided to adopt.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:35.476
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:36.567
Spread out!

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:39.545
Pick me.
I promise I'll go this time without any fuss.

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:43.378
Oh! I'm sorry, boys, but they've
already decided who they're adopting.

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:50.424
So, how about it, Murph?
Will you be a part of our family?

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.418
Are you serious, dude? Me?

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:57.064
And you're not even getting paid?

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:02.202
Oh! Um...

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:05.535
Sorry, mister,
your offer is very nice and all,

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:09.234
but I think you better pick someone else.

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.075
It's okay, Murph,

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:13.840
you should go.

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:16.541
This is your big break.

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:19.777
Not a chance, kid. Not without you.

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:23.181
Well, I guess we'll just have to take
all three of you.

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:25.920
What three?
I was just talking about me and Peez.

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.551
Well, yeah, of course,

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:31.725
but there's also the kid that we just sprang
from the foster home across town.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.858
Peezer.

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:35.126
Weezer!

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:49.077
Pack your bags,
you three. It's time to go home.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.887
Three cheers for the boys.

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.718
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Oh, please!

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.553
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Hooray!

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.727
- Hip, hip hooray!
Hooray!

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:02.789
Gee, it sure feels good
to not louse things up for once.

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.455
Oh, you said it.

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:08.791
Oh!

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:15.398
I'm gonna mash your heads like potatoes.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.985
Hey, fellas, wait! Wait up!

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:30.821
Whoa! Whoa!
How do you steer this thing? Oh, boy!

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:37.160
- Hello, everyone, I'm Bob Farrelly.
- And I'm Pete Farrelly.

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:39.165
And we're the guys that made the movie
you just watched.

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:42.168
We want you to know that all the stunts
that were performed in our film,

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.465
they were done by professionals.
And all the tools,

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.437
are not real. They're rubber.

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:47.907
Watch this.

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.005
Now, let's watch that with sound effects.

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.569
Pretty cool.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.238
Remember that sledgehammer scene?
That, too, made out of rubber.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.614
Fake, isn't that right, Bobby?

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:59.016
That's right, Pete.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.451
See. He didn't get hurt.

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.114
Remember the eye poke?

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:06.021
Now let's look at that again in slow motion.

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:12.927
Kids, do not poke anyone in the eye.
It's very dangerous.

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:15.435
The point is,
this movie is all about fun and games.

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.664
So please play safe at home.

01:26:17.772 --> 01:26:19.107
Thank you.

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:31.349
<i>I'll hold your hand
