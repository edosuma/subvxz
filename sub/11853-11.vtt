In Antarctica!

10:59.992 --> 11:02.428
Once upon a time,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.630

11:07.666 --> 11:10.369
Okay, babies, play time is over!

11:10.436 --> 11:13.305
It's time for us to get you back
to your mommies and daddies.

11:13.372 --> 11:16.008
Everybody into the stroller!

11:18.177 --> 11:20.880
Which one of the babies
should we take home first?

11:20.946 --> 11:24.717
Little Chick, Middle Chick
or Big Chick?

11:24.784 --> 11:27.420
Let's take Little Chick!

11:27.486 --> 11:30.489
Okay! Little Chick lives
in Icicle Bay.

11:30.556 --> 11:31.957
{\an1}Let's go!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.427
But we better watch out
for leopard seals!

11:34.493 --> 11:37.129
They eat penguins!

11:37.196 --> 11:38.431
(Chirping)

11:38.497 --> 11:39.932
Don't worry, little penguins.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.301
It's our job to keep you safe.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.604
All right, chicks, let's roll.

11:45.671 --> 11:50.609
<i>So, the baby-penguin-sitters</i>

12:04.557 --> 12:05.758
(Barking)

12:05.825 --> 12:09.628
Leopard seal!

12:05.825 --> 12:09.628
Leopard seal!

12:14.066 --> 12:15.634
That was a close one!

12:15.701 --> 12:17.169
We'd better hurry up

12:17.236 --> 12:19.538
and get these chicks back
to their mommies and daddies.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.841
Okay! Who's next?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.543
Middle Chick's mommy
lives in Snowy Cove.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.246
Then that's where we're going!

12:27.313 --> 12:30.850

♪

13:08.053 --> 13:09.755
That was close!

13:09.822 --> 13:12.324
We better bring Big Chick
back to her daddy

13:12.391 --> 13:14.593
before that leopard seal
comes back!

13:14.660 --> 13:17.563
Let's go to Emperor Beach!

13:17.630 --> 13:21.066
Here we are, Emperor Beach!

13:21.133 --> 13:23.402
Where the Emperor penguins live!

13:23.469 --> 13:25.938
Look at all those penguins!

13:26.005 --> 13:29.008
How are we ever going to find
Big Chick's daddy?

13:29.074 --> 13:32.912
Well, penguins make special
sounds to call each other.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.415
Each mommy and daddy knows their
penguin chick's call the best.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.318
So, we just need to match
Big Chick's call

13:39.385 --> 13:41.320
to the right daddy!

13:41.387 --> 13:45.791
Okay, Big Chick,
start squawking!

13:45.858 --> 13:47.393
(Chirping)

13:47.459 --> 13:49.929
We need your help!

13:49.995 --> 13:53.499
{\an8}Big Chick squawks
four times in a row.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.768
{\an8}(Chirping)

13:55.834 --> 13:57.570
{\an8}Which one of
these daddy penguins

13:57.636 --> 14:01.340
{\an8}also squawks four times?
Let's listen to this penguin!

14:01.407 --> 14:03.976
{\an8}(Squawking)

14:04.043 --> 14:07.213
{\an8}Was that enough?

14:07.279 --> 14:08.614
{\an7}No!

14:07.279 --> 14:08.614
{\an8}No!

14:08.681 --> 14:09.748
{\an8}That was only three!

14:09.815 --> 14:11.617
{\an8}That's wasn't enough!

14:11.684 --> 14:14.320

14:21.327 --> 14:22.928
{\an8}Yeah!

14:22.995 --> 14:25.731
{\an8}He called four times!

14:25.798 --> 14:29.235
Let's see if he recognizes
Big Chick's call!

14:29.301 --> 14:31.470

15:15.314 --> 15:17.049
"Pup"?

15:17.116 --> 15:20.286
Yeah!
Baby seals are called "Pups"!
