WEBVTT

00:32.834 --> 00:34.301
Attention please.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.970
Thank you, at this
time I would like

00:36.003 --> 00:37.571
to turn this news
conference over

00:37.604 --> 00:39.974
to FBI regional director of
public affairs,

00:40.007 --> 00:41.776
James Gardner, who is
going to give us

00:41.809 --> 00:44.344
more information on the
investigation.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.245
Thank you.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.315
Thank you, Chief Oswald.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.051
I'll take a few
questions in a moment,

00:50.084 --> 00:50.952
but please keep in mind that

00:50.985 --> 00:53.520
this is still an active
investigation.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.022
I ask for your patience

00:55.056 --> 00:56.423
and that you would hold

00:56.456 --> 00:59.392
any unnecessary or
inflammatory speculation.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.999
The suspect, Tador Bushati, 53,
was killed

01:05.032 --> 01:06.566
in his Brooklyn apartment during

01:06.600 --> 01:08.770
an interview with the
FBI investigating

01:08.803 --> 01:11.973
the New York city subway
bombing this past fall.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.377
Relax pal, put you hands in
the air, real slow.

01:30.992 --> 01:32.325
The agent involved in
the shooting

01:32.359 --> 01:35.362
at peregrine avenue
and sixth street

01:35.395 --> 01:37.397
was following a lead
when Bushati

01:37.430 --> 01:41.401
initiated a violent
confrontation and was killed.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.708
I want your contact
and the money.

01:47.742 --> 01:48.642
I don't got it.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.342
Bullshit.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.817
That's all we have for an
official statement

01:55.850 --> 01:57.785
at that this time, I'll take a
couple of questions.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.391
What evidence connects

02:04.424 --> 02:06.626
the dead suspect to the
subway bombing?

02:06.660 --> 02:09.730
I'm not at liberty to discuss
any evidence at this time.

02:18.438 --> 02:19.573
Mother fuck.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.145
I want the names and the money.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.112
Fuck you.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.446
No, fuck you.

02:30.852 --> 02:31.685
Give me your wallet.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.492
Yes.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.428
Sir, a local police
source reported

02:41.461 --> 02:43.130
no other firearms on
the scene besides

02:43.164 --> 02:44.866
the loan FBI agents weapon.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.368
Suspect was armed with a
butcher's knife.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.137
Chump change.

02:52.173 --> 02:56.110
Tador Bushati, your license is
expired, imagine that

03:02.183 --> 03:03.617
Your family, huh?

03:03.650 --> 03:04.785
Fuck you.

03:04.819 --> 03:07.989
I think it is, you know, I think
I'll just keep this one.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.371
Wouldn't you say

03:23.403 --> 03:24.872
that was an excessive
use of force?

03:24.906 --> 03:28.075
Absolutely not, our agents are
trained to respond

03:28.109 --> 03:30.677
with deadly force no matter
what the weapon.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.214
That's all the time I have,
thank you very much.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.958
Nantucket tower, this
is twin Cessna

03:43.991 --> 03:47.627
November 247 echo fox, one mile
from uptighed intersection

03:47.661 --> 03:50.164
3,000 feet with
information foxtrot.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.799
Heading 150 degrees.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.469
Twin Cessna November 247 echo
fox, Nantucket tower.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.939
You're half a mile from
uptight intersection,

03:57.972 --> 04:01.675
turn left at 080 degrees,
maintain 2,300 feet.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.978
Intercepter replies you're clear
for runway six approach.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.578
Rodger Nantucket tower.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.249
Hi, honey, we're about to
lead in Nantucket.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.251
So we're a little bit late,
I know.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.486
Here, nobody's more
excited than Flounder.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.188
Say hi to baby.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.189
I'm trying to talk to the tower,

04:15.222 --> 04:16.290
keep my eyes on the numbers.

04:16.324 --> 04:19.226
Okay, all right, we love you,
we'll see you soon.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.861
We're losing altitude, honey!

04:20.895 --> 04:21.729
Hold on!

05:02.303 --> 05:05.239
Okay, everyone it's
thumper time!

05:08.175 --> 05:09.243
It's thumper time.

05:13.014 --> 05:14.782
What's the name of the game?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.816
Thumper!

05:15.850 --> 05:17.118
Why do we play?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.886
To get fucked up!

05:18.919 --> 05:21.122
Please language, ladies
and gentlemen.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.156
Oh shut up.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.092
Oh my God.

05:25.126 --> 05:26.193
Continue.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.737
You fucked up, drink.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.576
I'll never keep up
without Tillie.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.980
And where would she be?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.647
She's biking here.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.581
At night?

05:48.615 --> 05:49.984
A wise decision considering

05:50.017 --> 05:51.886
her license has been suspended.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.889
I've been sober one night this
week and I'm driving.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.589
Oh great, you're my ride.

05:56.623 --> 06:00.061
So since her parents died
Tillie's been drunk for weeks.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.196
Months, still counting.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.266
Tillie!

06:05.299 --> 06:06.300
Tillie my love.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.201
Hey babe.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.602
The night is saved.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.971
You had a head start.

06:11.005 --> 06:11.872
Yes.

06:13.908 --> 06:15.910
Oh.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.813
For dear Tillie I would alter

06:18.846 --> 06:21.315
my sexual orientation to
whatever her preference.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.752
Oh you.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.652
Niko.

06:32.927 --> 06:33.794
My man.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.265
Any success with your
acquisition of contraband?

06:38.299 --> 06:39.233
Have I ever let you down?

06:39.266 --> 06:40.201
No.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.704
Lou would go down for good weed.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.906
I genuinely resemble
that remark.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.077
Niko, meet my two
dearest flowers.

06:50.111 --> 06:52.880
Felicity going to Berkeley, and
Tillie going to Columbia.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.415
Leave it to Oxford
boy to introduce

06:54.448 --> 06:56.817
us by our lesser schools.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.220
I see you've found some
more dearest buds.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.922
Nothing quite like the aroma
of central Oregon.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.227
My immigrant compadre here
is going to BC.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.027
Nice to meet you.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.631
Congratulations, Colombia, it's
a really nice school.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.836
We haven't seen you
around before.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.171
It's only my second
summer on the island,

07:17.204 --> 07:19.306
but my first altar rock,
thanks to Lou.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.375
Oh, and you're working
for living that,

07:21.408 --> 07:23.277
that is, that is refreshing.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.779
You know, Lou here thinks that
he's working class

07:25.813 --> 07:27.114
since he got a job turning

07:27.148 --> 07:29.350
on the sprinklers at the
Nantucket golf club.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.719
It's true.

07:36.023 --> 07:36.891
Welcome.

07:42.997 --> 07:46.767
That's a disqualification
before the first round.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.968
Such a pity.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.079
I think I need to go home.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.316
Would you prefer my escort?

08:03.450 --> 08:05.152
I'm sober, I can
give her a ride.

08:05.186 --> 08:07.154
Till, do you want me
to go with you?

08:07.188 --> 08:10.090
No, you just stay, have fun.

08:10.124 --> 08:10.991
Wait.

08:13.127 --> 08:15.129
Don't forget your mouthwash.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.735
Whoa, you okay.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.903
Yeah, oh my bike.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.105
This man is a
veritable stranger.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.375
He's your man, your compadre.

08:28.409 --> 08:30.077
You just introduced us.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.781
You broke your bike.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.282
Yeah, I fell.

08:35.316 --> 08:36.850
Don't worry, I'll get it
fixed for you.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.886
I've got some friends for that.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.888
An immigrant and a gentlemen.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.792
I understand him more than
I understand you

08:44.825 --> 08:47.094
and your weird
version of English.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.930
I can speak English properly,
too.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.332
Okay?

08:52.900 --> 08:56.170
You boarding school boy, such
pretentious bullshit.

09:03.177 --> 09:04.945
What's up with the rain?

09:04.979 --> 09:06.413
Because it's Nantucket silly.

09:11.185 --> 09:12.786
So embarrassed.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.054
I'm used to it.

09:14.088 --> 09:16.557
What, people puking when
they meet you?

09:16.590 --> 09:19.360
No, giving someone a ride when
they really need one.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.029
You're sweet.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.067
You want?

09:27.101 --> 09:27.935
No, I'm driving.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.910
You okay?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.012
Stop the car.

09:38.045 --> 09:38.879
Huh?

09:38.912 --> 09:39.880
Stop the car.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.547
Here?

09:40.581 --> 09:41.448
Yeah, come on.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.852
Come on.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.316
Come in.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.384
No, I'm okay, I'm good.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.305
Here.

10:38.339 --> 10:40.507
God, you must be freezing.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.443
No, no, the water's warm.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.288
Why didn't you come in?

10:55.189 --> 10:56.056
I can't swim.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.194
You live on an island silly,
gotta swim.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.462
Yeah I know.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.896
Maybe you could teach me.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.599
I'd like to.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.577
Whoa, nice lights.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.012
Yeah, ready for the fourth.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.186
So all those guys at altar rock,

11:26.220 --> 11:27.388
are they all your friends?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.357
As long as I can remember.

11:30.391 --> 11:31.558
We're here every summer.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.929
Well, anytime you need a ride.

11:35.963 --> 11:36.997
I'll remember.

11:39.066 --> 11:39.933
Here's my cell.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.071
Call me so I have yours.

11:56.517 --> 11:57.551
And I'll take care of your bike

11:57.584 --> 11:59.253
and call you when it's ready.

12:07.729 --> 12:09.496
Wouldn't want to get
you in trouble.

12:09.530 --> 12:10.364
No.

12:14.268 --> 12:16.003
Bye.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.204
Bye.

12:50.304 --> 12:52.072
Where do you think you're going?

12:53.207 --> 12:55.209
I almost called the police.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.109
Come over here.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.722
Sorry aunt Jenny, I know I
should have called.

13:07.755 --> 13:10.324
I was up at altar rock, there
was no signal up there.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.093
I know altar rock,
that's why I worry.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.696
You're not my mother.

13:18.599 --> 13:22.202
Jennifer is just as worried as
your mother would be.

13:25.740 --> 13:29.676
Look, we just graduated,
it's summer

13:29.711 --> 13:33.514
and we're all going to college
soon so we went for a swim.

13:36.617 --> 13:38.485
You never heard of
skinny dipping?

13:40.454 --> 13:43.056
Okay, definitely not
something mom would say.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.126
What would she say about a DUI?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.529
I don't know, she's dead.

13:48.562 --> 13:49.797
Where's your license?

13:49.831 --> 13:51.733
Hey, just take it easy,
all right?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.469
Go take a hot shower.

14:00.541 --> 14:02.643
That was Tramary by Shumont.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.846
Only two days left till
fourth of July.

14:04.879 --> 14:06.346
Hope everyone up
there in Nantucket

14:06.380 --> 14:07.849
has a happy independence day.

14:24.832 --> 14:26.801
It's been every night now.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.671
You were like this when we met.

14:32.907 --> 14:34.308
Yes, but I didn't have

14:34.341 --> 14:36.143
to cope with losing parents.

14:37.411 --> 14:39.279
I'm really worried about Tillie.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.151
I know Chris, I've been there
and she's on her way there.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.823
Here, I'm here for
you and Tillie.

14:48.856 --> 14:49.690
Okay?

14:49.724 --> 14:50.557
Kay.

15:22.957 --> 15:23.624
Hi.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.863
I'm FBI agent Richard Cantrell.

15:28.896 --> 15:31.365
Phyllis, if you've got a moment,

15:31.398 --> 15:32.800
I'd like to ask you a
few questions.

15:32.834 --> 15:33.700
For sure.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.739
According to my reports, this
is the last airfield

15:37.772 --> 15:39.406
that the Gardeners flew out of

15:39.439 --> 15:41.809
on route to Nantucket,
when plane crashed.

15:42.744 --> 15:43.945
Did you know them?

15:43.978 --> 15:45.612
James and Celeste?

15:45.646 --> 15:47.882
Bummer, really sucks.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.217
What we're doing is
we're looking

15:50.250 --> 15:52.653
at the possibility of an
aircraft tampering.

15:53.755 --> 15:54.588
Oh wow.

15:55.923 --> 15:58.592
So I'm going to need to see
your maintenance logs

15:58.625 --> 16:01.628
and the hard drive to the
security monitoring system.

16:01.662 --> 16:05.800
Well, yeah, whatever,
have at it.

16:07.835 --> 16:09.469
Thank you Phyllis.

16:09.503 --> 16:10.370
Your a dream.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.912
Well, don't look so
disappointed.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.783
She'll be down in a minute.

16:21.816 --> 16:22.917
Please come in.

16:22.950 --> 16:23.818
I don't bite.

16:25.686 --> 16:26.253
Niko.

16:27.621 --> 16:30.390
Jennifer Crane aunt Jenny to
Tillie and her friends.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.391
Very nice to meet you.

16:32.626 --> 16:35.730
Oh, I volunteer at the
battered women's clinic.

16:35.763 --> 16:38.632
I'm so glad I get the chance to
meet you, close the door.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.402
Can I get you
something to drink?

16:42.436 --> 16:44.404
I'm okay, thank you.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.473
So what do you do on the island?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.475
I drive a cab, saving
for college.

16:51.746 --> 16:53.513
Tillie, Niko's here.

16:56.550 --> 16:58.318
That's a good thing, kids here,

16:58.351 --> 16:59.653
they just take
Nantucket for granted.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.655
No responsibilities.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.990
Why'd you come?

17:03.024 --> 17:04.658
Eat.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.493
My mother used to work here
a long time ago,

17:06.526 --> 17:08.295
Nantucket was her
favorite place.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.897
Your mother has very good taste.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.265
She did.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.269
I'm sorry.

17:17.905 --> 17:19.539
Where are you from?

17:19.573 --> 17:21.508
Well, I grew up here, I
mean in America,

17:21.541 --> 17:23.044
but I was born in Albania.

17:23.077 --> 17:25.445
Ah, that's where the good
looks come from.

17:26.914 --> 17:27.982
Okay, let's go.

17:28.015 --> 17:28.850
Here let me help.

17:28.883 --> 17:29.683
Thanks.

17:31.018 --> 17:34.354
Niko told me he drives a taxi
to save for college.

17:36.057 --> 17:37.457
Terrific.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.391
Later aunt Jenny.

18:01.983 --> 18:03.951
That looks beautiful.

18:03.985 --> 18:04.986
Good as new.

18:05.953 --> 18:06.653
I hope so.

18:10.624 --> 18:12.860
How well do you know Nantucket?

18:12.894 --> 18:15.096
I do drive a cab, but I don't
get much time off.

18:15.129 --> 18:17.799
Oh, I'm going to have to
show you around then.

18:17.832 --> 18:18.665
Now?

18:18.698 --> 18:19.633
Yeah, come on.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.004
Come on.

18:54.035 --> 18:55.635
So how about that
swimming lesson?

18:55.669 --> 18:57.404
No, I'll take a rain check.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.986
What are you going to major in,
in Boston college?

19:12.019 --> 19:13.520
You know I'm not sure.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.554
What do you suggest?

19:16.023 --> 19:17.959
What do you think
about engineering?

19:17.992 --> 19:20.460
I'm mechanical, I could do that.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.662
How about dentistry?

19:22.696 --> 19:24.732
No, I couldn't, no, no.

19:24.765 --> 19:25.632
Architecture.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.168
Yeah.

19:27.201 --> 19:29.469
I'd love to design and
build houses someday.

19:29.502 --> 19:34.407
Single file, you rookie shit
heels, single file.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.547
Are you okay?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.716
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.520
Hey, hey!

19:56.596 --> 19:57.430
You okay?

19:57.464 --> 19:58.132
I'm fine.

20:00.101 --> 20:01.568
Such a jerk.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.737
What did you say to him?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.040
I told him to have a nice day.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.743
Is that Italian?

20:08.776 --> 20:10.211
I took some in high school.

20:10.244 --> 20:11.312
It was Albanian.

20:11.345 --> 20:14.447
It slipped, people often mistake
and we encourage it.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.851
Nobody wants to be from
anywhere like Albania.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.886
No in America, it
doesn't matter.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.154
My great grandmother, Matilda.

20:20.187 --> 20:22.089
She was a roma gypsy.

20:22.123 --> 20:22.857
You have gypsy blood.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.560
Well do like we do then, say
you're from Northern Italy.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.171
Thanks for the headshot asshole.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.447
Agent Hanley.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.850
Hey, Robert I've got the
son of a bitch.

21:22.883 --> 21:23.583
You did?

21:23.616 --> 21:26.087
Yeah, he's headed to Nantucket.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.154
Nantucket?

21:27.188 --> 21:29.991
Yeah, look, this was revenge.

21:30.024 --> 21:31.691
James's, his daughter,
my God daughter,

21:31.726 --> 21:33.294
Tillie lives on Nantucket.

21:33.327 --> 21:35.595
She could be next.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.564
I can't do this solo anymore.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.498
I need your help.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.533
Got your back.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.270
Thanks, just meet me there
as soon as you can

21:43.304 --> 21:44.872
I'm on my way.

21:47.108 --> 21:47.942
Good ride.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.210
Yeah.

21:49.243 --> 21:50.277
I hope you're legs okay.

21:50.311 --> 21:51.145
Oh, it'll be fine.

21:51.178 --> 21:52.046
You sure?

21:52.079 --> 21:54.048
Yeah, I'm accident prone.

21:58.719 --> 21:59.854
That's a beautiful house.

22:01.122 --> 22:03.623
Well, you just gave me the
most beautiful day.

22:53.874 --> 22:57.211
Do I sense a new
romance blossoming?

22:57.244 --> 22:58.879
We were just having fun okay?

23:00.081 --> 23:02.216
All right, the summer thing,
before Columbia.

23:03.284 --> 23:05.286
Come on, let's walk
on the beach.

23:05.319 --> 23:06.921
No more Columbia talk.

23:06.954 --> 23:09.090
All right, let's talk
about Berkeley.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.292
I'm kidding.

23:11.325 --> 23:11.792
Jeez.

23:11.826 --> 23:12.625
Better be kidding.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.461
You know, I really
would just want

23:13.494 --> 23:16.363
to hear about your new boy,
Niko.

23:16.397 --> 23:17.865
Maybe.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.100
What, maybe?

23:19.133 --> 23:20.234
At some point.

23:20.267 --> 23:21.335
At some point?

23:21.368 --> 23:22.136
At some point what?

23:22.169 --> 23:23.137
Like where, when?

23:23.170 --> 23:25.139
Hey but you know what, I really,
really, really

23:25.172 --> 23:26.240
excited for that fourth
of July party.

23:26.273 --> 23:27.074
Oh yeah.

23:27.108 --> 23:27.908
It's gonna be so fun.

23:27.942 --> 23:28.608
It's gonna be good.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.111
Just before we have to go off

23:30.144 --> 23:31.846
and be adults I guess.

23:31.879 --> 23:32.847
We're hardly adults.

23:49.797 --> 23:52.699
Dock master to horn blower
welcome to Nantucket.

23:52.733 --> 23:54.268
A light hand lizard on
that position.

25:01.802 --> 25:03.037
Marco!

25:03.070 --> 25:04.772
Look who it is!

25:04.805 --> 25:06.840
Holy shit, look at this boat.

25:06.874 --> 25:08.409
It's nice, right?

25:08.442 --> 25:11.245
Come on, come on, let
down the gangway.

25:11.278 --> 25:13.280
Come on board, I'm coming.

25:16.951 --> 25:18.152
We need to celebrate.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.387
This is not a special occasion,
huh?

25:20.421 --> 25:23.157
The two of us together again,
after such a long time.

25:26.927 --> 25:29.863
Look at you, big, strong.

25:29.897 --> 25:31.465
Man no longer a child huh?

25:31.498 --> 25:32.800
I've been working hard.

25:32.833 --> 25:34.768
Working hard, that's good, good.

25:36.070 --> 25:37.938
You still in the same place
or you move on?

25:37.972 --> 25:40.140
Yeah, everything's the same.

25:41.275 --> 25:43.177
Well don't worry, I'm here now.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.045
We're going to change that, want
to drink espresso or what?

25:45.079 --> 25:45.746
Yeah.

25:45.779 --> 25:46.647
Come on, it's good to see you.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.782
So how did you like the
truck I got you?

25:48.816 --> 25:49.450
I love it.

25:49.483 --> 25:50.484
All the guys are jealous.

25:51.352 --> 25:52.286
It's beautiful out.

25:52.319 --> 25:53.787
Yeah.

25:53.821 --> 25:54.488
So pretty.

26:00.327 --> 26:02.563
Nobody's more excited
then Flounder.

26:02.596 --> 26:03.564
Honey, hold on!

26:03.597 --> 26:07.101
What if he's only using you
for a green card?

26:07.134 --> 26:09.103
He's already got one,
it's not like that.

26:12.606 --> 26:14.074
Niko's world is different.

26:15.843 --> 26:17.544
He moves inside it calmly.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.282
He's real, you know?

26:22.950 --> 26:23.817
I get that.

26:25.052 --> 26:27.521
But do you even know what
country he's from?

26:27.554 --> 26:29.023
America.

26:29.056 --> 26:31.191
No, I meant originally.

26:32.926 --> 26:33.827
Northern Italy.

26:35.129 --> 26:37.564
Well, I mean, he is
really hot so.

26:39.199 --> 26:41.402
You have my vote to let him in.

26:41.435 --> 26:42.436
Oh, thanks.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.011
Hi sir, ticket to Nantucket?

26:51.912 --> 26:53.180
Yes sir.

26:53.213 --> 26:54.048
How you doing?

26:54.081 --> 26:54.915
Good thank you.

26:54.948 --> 26:56.083
245 Cantrell.

26:56.116 --> 26:56.950
Cantrell?

26:56.984 --> 26:57.618
Yes sir.

26:57.651 --> 26:59.453
No charge, go ahead.

27:19.206 --> 27:19.940
Show me this video.

27:21.075 --> 27:24.244
I want to see this famous 4th of
July Nantucket party.

27:31.018 --> 27:32.152
This is 4th of July
last time summer.

27:32.186 --> 27:33.087
It was amazing.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.390
It was so much fun,
we had a blast.

27:36.423 --> 27:37.891
You would love it.

27:41.295 --> 27:45.466
6,000 fat, rich, drunk
American babies

27:45.499 --> 27:47.501
who are chanting USA, USA.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.372
Barking like dogs who think
they own the world.

27:54.575 --> 27:55.909
Shut them up right.

28:03.617 --> 28:05.619
You did good my brother.

28:07.054 --> 28:08.589
Come here with our mother.

28:08.622 --> 28:10.991
Go to school, make friends.

28:11.692 --> 28:12.526
Learn to speak good English,

28:12.559 --> 28:14.561
you get the job and
the green card.

28:17.965 --> 28:19.500
And when our father is butchered

28:19.533 --> 28:21.602
by the FBI you do
not even blink.

28:23.670 --> 28:26.206
You do not forget but
you don't blink.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.241
Like a true solider.

28:29.443 --> 28:30.911
He would be proud of you.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.048
Look Marco, I.

28:35.082 --> 28:36.150
No, don't talk.

28:36.183 --> 28:38.352
Just listen, come on.

29:08.182 --> 29:10.284
It's nice to get here
before the others.

29:10.317 --> 29:11.185
Yeah.

29:22.062 --> 29:25.032
You know I don't know anything
about your family.

29:25.065 --> 29:27.401
Who do you have to
endlessly nag you?

29:27.434 --> 29:28.302
Nobody.

29:30.070 --> 29:31.205
You say that so.

29:33.474 --> 29:35.242
I've been on my own three years.

29:37.745 --> 29:40.013
Your father, your mother?

29:41.448 --> 29:42.316
They all died.

29:45.185 --> 29:46.386
Oh God.

29:49.590 --> 29:51.291
I'm sorry.

29:51.325 --> 29:52.192
It's okay.

29:55.095 --> 29:56.530
Hey, it's okay, what's wrong?

30:03.103 --> 30:04.371
Let me show you something.

30:09.276 --> 30:12.112
Hi honey, we're about to
land in Nantucket.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.348
So we're a little bit
late I know,

30:14.381 --> 30:16.718
nobody's more excited
than Flounder.

30:16.751 --> 30:17.785
Say hi to my baby.

30:17.819 --> 30:20.120
I'm trying to talk to the tower,
keep my eyes open.

30:20.153 --> 30:23.257
Okay, all right, we love you,
we'll see you soon.

30:23.290 --> 30:24.324
We're losing altitude.

30:24.358 --> 30:25.592
Honey, hold on!

30:30.697 --> 30:32.566
God, that's horrible.

30:40.742 --> 30:42.810
That was the last
time I saw them.

30:45.445 --> 30:48.615
See, we're both orphans.

30:50.150 --> 30:52.486
Only you're like a
veteran at it.

30:54.889 --> 30:55.823
I'm still a rookie.

30:57.825 --> 31:01.295
Maybe three years from now
when somebody asks me

31:01.328 --> 31:06.333
about my parents, I can be as
calm and collected as you.

31:07.401 --> 31:08.803
No, no, I hope not.

31:16.610 --> 31:17.812
Do not participate in any

31:17.845 --> 31:19.747
lascivious
activities without me.

31:24.919 --> 31:25.753
What's up Lou?

31:25.787 --> 31:26.687
Oh, forgive me.

31:26.721 --> 31:27.755
How could you?

31:27.789 --> 31:29.656
I possess the liquid
sex enhancers.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.225
Niko, my good man,
are your herbal

31:32.259 --> 31:33.327
coffers sufficiently stocked?

31:33.360 --> 31:35.562
Of course, of course.

31:35.596 --> 31:36.731
Hey careful.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.498
It's just Lou, there's no
one else here.

31:38.532 --> 31:39.399
Just old Lou.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.470
Fuck, fuck, this fucking hill.

31:43.503 --> 31:47.608
Oh and for edification
Felicity has prematurely

31:47.641 --> 31:50.177
forfeited any duties as a
designated driver tonight.

31:50.210 --> 31:51.545
Oh shut up, I'm perfect.

31:52.847 --> 31:55.717
Oh shit, fuck, this
fucking hill.

32:19.573 --> 32:20.775
I'd like to thank you all

32:20.808 --> 32:24.144
for coming today and sharing
your stories with each other.

32:25.679 --> 32:28.348
I know this is a very
difficult process,

32:28.382 --> 32:30.550
but remember our strength
is in our group.

32:31.819 --> 32:34.756
Now, today is a very special
day for one of us.

32:34.789 --> 32:37.190
It's the first
anniversary for Jennifer.

32:44.866 --> 32:47.501
Keep it up and give a hug
to Tillie for me.

32:47.534 --> 32:48.201
Thank you pastor.

32:49.436 --> 32:51.773
I couldn't have done it
without each of you.

33:00.014 --> 33:01.716
Hey Jen.

33:01.749 --> 33:03.751
Oh my God, Richard.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.285
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

33:05.318 --> 33:07.387
How are you, why
didn't you call?

33:09.556 --> 33:11.324
Jen I has some disturbing news.

33:12.492 --> 33:15.295
The NTSB salvaged James's
is the aircraft

33:15.328 --> 33:16.396
and we now have evidence that

33:16.430 --> 33:18.532
there was tampering
with the plane.

33:18.565 --> 33:19.499
What?

33:19.533 --> 33:21.501
Do you remember a man
named Tador Bushati?

33:22.904 --> 33:25.639
The suspect in the New York
subway bombings last fall.

33:25.672 --> 33:26.708
The one who died in FBI custody?

33:26.741 --> 33:27.407
Yes.

33:27.441 --> 33:28.508
How does that relate to Jane?

33:28.542 --> 33:32.579
James was the public face of the
FBI for television.

33:34.548 --> 33:35.983
Revenge?

33:36.017 --> 33:36.884
I believe so.

33:39.386 --> 33:42.589
This man maybe connected.

33:45.459 --> 33:46.593
Son of a bitch.

33:46.626 --> 33:49.629
We now know that he had
unauthorized access to James's

33:49.663 --> 33:51.565
aircraft the day
before it took off.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.802
Are Tillie and I in danger.

33:54.836 --> 33:56.971
Absolutely, that's why I'm here.

33:58.773 --> 34:00.007
Send that to me.

34:00.041 --> 34:00.908
Of course.

34:02.342 --> 34:03.010
How is Tillie.

34:04.311 --> 34:05.645
As well as can be expected.

34:07.647 --> 34:09.483
She's got a new boyfriend.

34:09.516 --> 34:10.985
Really?

34:11.018 --> 34:13.788
He's a hardworking kid
from Eastern Europe

34:13.821 --> 34:14.756
and he's cute too.

34:16.556 --> 34:18.558
How are your sisters boys?

34:18.592 --> 34:19.761
Coping, thank you.

34:22.662 --> 34:25.665
It's been a
nightmare since 9/11.

34:25.699 --> 34:26.801
Who knows what's next.

34:28.703 --> 34:29.569
Did it go through?

34:31.072 --> 34:32.073
Got it.

34:32.106 --> 34:33.007
Okay.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.208
You know where to find me.

34:34.242 --> 34:38.345
If you see anything or you need
anything, just call me.

35:04.105 --> 35:06.073
Hey Joe, we got enough
Triple A stocked?

35:06.107 --> 35:06.941
Absolutely.

35:06.974 --> 35:07.842
Great, great.

35:09.143 --> 35:11.344
Hey sweetie, can you push
back those tables?

35:11.378 --> 35:13.815
We need to get ready for a big
4th of July party tonight,

35:13.848 --> 35:17.384
so let's just make some dance
for our hot DJ tonight.

35:19.821 --> 35:20.587
Some of the richest people

35:20.620 --> 35:22.589
in America live
along this beach.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.393
You got all these mansions,
soon enough

35:26.426 --> 35:28.830
they're gonna fall
into the ocean.

35:28.863 --> 35:29.764
Climate change.

35:35.803 --> 35:36.904
It's so messed up.

35:36.938 --> 35:40.107
Multimillion dollar castles
built on sliding sands.

35:43.577 --> 35:45.046
We created it.

35:45.079 --> 35:46.413
Yeah.

35:55.622 --> 35:57.424
It's all our fault.

35:59.193 --> 36:01.863
Hey, get off my beach.

36:01.896 --> 36:03.697
Get off my beach.

36:03.731 --> 36:05.132
Who are you yelling at now?

36:05.166 --> 36:06.566
Oh honey, go make another drink.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.102
I got a drink right here.

36:08.135 --> 36:08.936
Whatever.

36:08.970 --> 36:11.138
It's America, it's
everyone's beach.

36:11.172 --> 36:12.974
Are you serious?

36:13.007 --> 36:14.742
You see the sand by
all the grass?

36:14.775 --> 36:16.711
That's the high water mark.

36:16.744 --> 36:18.145
You're worried about sand?

36:18.179 --> 36:20.047
Yeah, my sand.

36:20.081 --> 36:23.117
Out there, that's public,
that's their America.

36:23.150 --> 36:25.920
Where they're sitting,
that's my America.

36:25.953 --> 36:27.121
They seem like nice kids.

36:27.154 --> 36:28.488
Oh, great kids.

36:29.522 --> 36:30.958
Okay, we're going.

36:30.992 --> 36:31.859
Yeah.

36:32.827 --> 36:33.693
You know what?

36:34.862 --> 36:35.930
Let's go somewhere else.

36:35.963 --> 36:37.530
Yeah.

36:37.564 --> 36:38.833
I'll show you my America.

37:23.811 --> 37:25.512
Your America huh?

37:28.082 --> 37:29.750
Yeah.

37:29.784 --> 37:32.019
The one place in the
island I can't drink.

37:32.053 --> 37:32.787
What, why is that?

37:34.021 --> 37:36.623
My aunt and Chris
own this place.

37:36.656 --> 37:38.125
God, I hope we don't
run into them.

37:38.159 --> 37:38.993
Who's Chris?

37:39.026 --> 37:40.127
Her partner.

37:47.268 --> 37:48.635
Hey, Rupert.

37:52.605 --> 37:53.473
Hey.

37:55.608 --> 37:57.244
Hey, roomie!

37:57.278 --> 37:59.146
What's up papa, hey!

38:01.681 --> 38:05.518
Whoa, wow, there's
plenty of room

38:05.552 --> 38:06.954
back in the apartment for her.

38:06.988 --> 38:11.158
Not gonna happen Edwardo,
not gonna happen.

38:11.192 --> 38:11.658
How you doing brother?

38:11.691 --> 38:12.592
Good, how are you?

38:12.625 --> 38:16.831
I'm all right, princess
coming through,

38:16.864 --> 38:18.766
make way, make way.

38:18.799 --> 38:21.769
Make way, all right, all right.

38:21.802 --> 38:24.671
Check out the goddamned on the
dance floor, put up your

38:24.705 --> 38:26.240
and get on out here.

38:26.273 --> 38:27.574
You okay?

38:27.607 --> 38:29.143
Yeah, I'm just looking
out for my aunt.

38:33.814 --> 38:34.581
Oh hey, hey, hey.

38:34.614 --> 38:37.151
You can dance, but
you can't drink.

38:38.953 --> 38:40.988
You must be Niko, I'm Chris.

38:42.223 --> 38:43.590
My aunts partner.

38:43.623 --> 38:45.558
Oh, very nice to meet you.

38:45.592 --> 38:50.563
Well enjoy our Bulgarian name.

38:52.699 --> 38:55.002
Your aunt has very good taste.

38:55.036 --> 38:56.170
Runs in the family.

39:07.348 --> 39:08.215
Cheers.

41:34.495 --> 41:36.096

41:37.898 --> 41:38.933
I know its not a beagle

41:38.966 --> 41:41.068
but she's was the happiest
puppy at the shelter.

41:43.871 --> 41:44.738
You love her?

41:46.473 --> 41:47.374
Of course.

41:47.408 --> 41:49.476
What are you gonna name her?

41:49.510 --> 41:50.344
Right now?

41:50.377 --> 41:51.212
Yeah.

41:51.245 --> 41:52.346
Well I don't know.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.048
I got to know her better first.

41:54.081 --> 41:56.250
Don't worry, we'll figure
it out together.

41:58.285 --> 41:59.720
I'd like that very much.

42:00.921 --> 42:02.356
Oh shit.

42:02.389 --> 42:03.324
Aunt Jenny doesn't do dogs.

42:04.558 --> 42:06.293
She wouldn't even let
Flounder in the house,

42:06.327 --> 42:07.428
and now she's stuck with me.

42:07.461 --> 42:10.831
Don't worry I'll take of her
until we figure that out.

42:10.864 --> 42:12.900
Don't forget I live with
ten dog sitters.

42:15.903 --> 42:18.372
Thank you, I love her.

42:22.042 --> 42:22.910
Thanks a lot.

42:30.918 --> 42:31.852
See you.

42:31.885 --> 42:32.519
Bye.

43:05.052 --> 43:08.055
Tillie, thank God you're back.

43:08.088 --> 43:11.225
I didn't know how to tell you
this over the phone.

43:11.258 --> 43:12.126
What is it?

43:13.894 --> 43:15.863
Your godfather came to
see me today.

43:17.064 --> 43:18.832
Your mom and your dad.

43:18.866 --> 43:19.867
They were murdered.

43:20.601 --> 43:22.469
It was an act of revenge.

43:23.437 --> 43:24.305
Revenge?

43:27.508 --> 43:30.110
Richard thinks it was this man,
have you seen him?

43:33.347 --> 43:34.214
No, no.

43:36.617 --> 43:38.552
He thinks he could be a
danger to us.

44:14.154 --> 44:16.890
Ow, ow, ow, you're hurting me.

44:18.625 --> 44:22.663
Ow, stop, stop, stop, ow, that
doesn't feel good, stop it.

44:22.696 --> 44:26.266
Oh shit, shit, sorry, sorry.

44:35.042 --> 44:35.909
Get out.

44:37.511 --> 44:39.446
I need to get dressed.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.548
A woman like you has no
respect for herself,

44:41.582 --> 44:43.016
therefore she gets no respect.

44:43.050 --> 44:45.619
Get the fuck out, Niko come on.

44:45.652 --> 44:47.955
Sit down, let's talk.

44:47.988 --> 44:49.590
You're a fucking asshole.

44:49.623 --> 44:50.491
Fuck you.

44:54.729 --> 44:56.230
Come on Niko, come on.

44:56.263 --> 44:57.564
Sit down, we good?

44:59.433 --> 45:00.300
Yeah.

45:12.379 --> 45:13.480
Miss.

45:13.514 --> 45:14.615
Get your hands off me!

45:14.648 --> 45:15.649
Take it easy, take it easy.

45:15.682 --> 45:17.484
Hey, I'm FBI.

45:17.518 --> 45:18.619
I'm not gonna hurt you.

45:20.354 --> 45:21.288
What is this, a bust?

45:21.321 --> 45:22.623
No, it's not a bust I just need

45:22.656 --> 45:24.525
to ask you a couple
of questions.

45:24.558 --> 45:26.460
Okay, I'm no hooker so.

45:26.493 --> 45:28.262
No one said you're a hooker.

45:28.295 --> 45:29.430
Young lady, look I
just need to talk

45:29.463 --> 45:31.665
to you about who's on
board that boat.

45:31.698 --> 45:32.734
All right?

45:32.767 --> 45:33.634
What's your name?

45:35.436 --> 45:36.336
It's Rebecca.

45:36.370 --> 45:38.038
Rebecca.

45:38.071 --> 45:40.474
I need to talk to you about
who's on that boat, okay?

45:40.507 --> 45:41.709
Okay.

45:41.743 --> 45:44.077
What were you doing on
that boat Rebecca?

45:45.679 --> 45:48.716
The last thing I remember is
being in the club

45:48.750 --> 45:51.318
and then I ended up with that
foreign, hairy pig.

45:53.353 --> 45:54.188
Is this the guy?

45:54.221 --> 45:55.088
Yes.

45:57.524 --> 45:59.126
He told me at a nice boat

45:59.159 --> 46:01.495
and that is the only true
thing he said to me.

46:01.528 --> 46:04.665
It doesn't make up for being a
shit and an asshole, does it?

46:04.698 --> 46:06.567
No it doesn't.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.435
What about the other guy?

46:08.469 --> 46:10.170
No idea.

46:10.204 --> 46:11.171
He called him Niko.

46:12.172 --> 46:13.040
Niko, good.

46:14.408 --> 46:18.045
Listen, Rebecca, is there anyone
else on board that boat?

46:19.179 --> 46:20.013
Not that I know of.

46:21.114 --> 46:24.117
Do me a favor and keep this
conversation between us.

46:24.151 --> 46:25.085
I want to get those guys that

46:25.118 --> 46:27.454
I don't want to blow this bust,
all right?

46:27.488 --> 46:28.322
Sure.

46:28.355 --> 46:30.023
No problem.

46:30.057 --> 46:32.059
Sober now, so won't be
blowing anything.

46:48.208 --> 46:49.309
Want a drink?

46:56.550 --> 46:58.218
Who's this infidel
bitch I see you

46:58.252 --> 47:00.487
with at the beach and the club?

47:00.521 --> 47:01.488
You were spying on me?

47:02.724 --> 47:06.660
Hey, I'm your older brother,
look out for you.

47:11.265 --> 47:13.500
She's a risk, she could talk.

47:13.534 --> 47:15.402
Never, she'd never betray me.

47:15.435 --> 47:16.670
Why?

47:16.704 --> 47:17.805
Because she wants to screw you

47:17.839 --> 47:19.707
like all these fucking
American whores?

47:19.741 --> 47:20.775
She's different.

47:21.709 --> 47:23.310
Maybe to you little brother.

47:24.378 --> 47:27.414
But to her, you're
just another toy.

47:27.447 --> 47:29.516
Curious little boy to play with.

47:32.286 --> 47:34.555
So tell me, who the fuck is she?

47:39.192 --> 47:40.762
She's just a local girl.

47:42.864 --> 47:43.630
Good.

47:44.866 --> 47:47.467
Then she can take you to the
fourth party with her friends

47:47.501 --> 47:50.705
and you bring the fireworks,
yes?

47:54.709 --> 47:57.377
Just make sure you bring
the truck tomorrow.

48:14.328 --> 48:16.396
I just finished a 24 hour shift,
I need rest.

48:21.602 --> 48:22.603
See you tomorrow.

48:30.210 --> 48:32.446
Hi honey, we're about to
land in Nantucket.

48:52.366 --> 48:53.533
I've been out of line.

48:58.806 --> 49:00.708
I'm sorry for being
so hard on you.

49:11.853 --> 49:13.620
You stop right there Romeo.

49:13.654 --> 49:14.521
Turn around.

49:15.622 --> 49:16.690
You think I'm kidding?

49:17.759 --> 49:18.760
Turn around!

49:21.495 --> 49:22.396
Move.

51:14.674 --> 51:17.677
You're little, I hate
America jihad.

51:17.712 --> 51:18.678
It's over.

51:24.484 --> 51:25.753
You fucking maniacs.

51:25.787 --> 51:27.755
You don't know when to stop.

51:27.789 --> 51:32.692
9/11, New York, The Pentagon,
now here,

51:32.727 --> 51:36.363
well whatever you had planned,
it's not happening.

51:38.365 --> 51:40.735
No 72 virgins for a martyr
this time asshole.

51:43.403 --> 51:45.106
James Gardner was a
friend of mine.

51:45.139 --> 51:46.606
You made it look like
an accident.

51:46.640 --> 51:48.943
No bullshit propaganda,
no credit claims.

51:48.976 --> 51:49.977
It was personal.

51:52.814 --> 51:54.548
Hey, recognize this photo?

51:55.649 --> 51:57.484
It's from your father's wallet.

51:57.517 --> 51:58.719
I'm right I?

51:58.753 --> 52:00.788
Like father, like sons.

52:00.822 --> 52:02.023
You'll be glad to know that

52:02.056 --> 52:04.025
your father died the
same way you will.

52:05.860 --> 52:07.561
Mother fuck!

52:07.594 --> 52:09.696
It's personal for me
too asshole!

52:09.730 --> 52:11.631
I'm here for justice.

52:11.665 --> 52:13.835
The subway bombing, remember?

52:13.868 --> 52:15.102
Your father.

52:15.136 --> 52:17.537
My sister was on that train.

52:17.571 --> 52:21.541
Obliterated, there wasn't enough
left of her to bury.

52:21.575 --> 52:23.643
but there was something left.

52:23.677 --> 52:25.146
Four young boys without
their mother,

52:25.179 --> 52:27.514
their father a broken
useless wreck.

52:28.883 --> 52:29.851
I'm here for them.

52:33.553 --> 52:34.989
Now where's the five
million dollars

52:35.022 --> 52:36.090
your father was holding?

52:36.123 --> 52:37.390
Before you waste any more of it

52:37.424 --> 52:39.794
on infidel whores and big boats?

52:39.827 --> 52:42.730
Those boys deserve that money,
not you.

52:42.763 --> 52:43.865
Fuck.

52:47.534 --> 52:50.137
Fine, you don't care
about killing.

52:50.171 --> 52:51.671
You don't care about dying.

52:56.443 --> 52:59.914
James and Celeste Gardner,
they got death.

52:59.947 --> 53:00.982
But you don't care.

53:03.751 --> 53:08.756
My sister, and 14 other people
on that subway car got death.

53:12.994 --> 53:14.628
But you don't care.

53:14.661 --> 53:18.531
But you sure do care
about the money.

53:21.836 --> 53:25.639
There's something to admire
about your brand of insanity.

53:25.672 --> 53:30.077
I could torture you, cut
your fingers off.

53:30.111 --> 53:34.547
Gouge your eyes out, but you
still wouldn't talk.

53:34.581 --> 53:36.183
But your little baby brother,
Niko?

53:39.754 --> 53:41.088
I don't think he's so tough.

53:44.091 --> 53:46.093
I'll find the money.

53:51.631 --> 53:52.632
bomb making 101.

53:53.968 --> 53:58.739
That's primitive, but it's
effective grant you that.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.142
My oh my.

54:01.175 --> 54:02.575
You have been a busy boy.

54:06.847 --> 54:10.952
That's just a little
too obvious, but.

54:25.598 --> 54:26.466
Huh?

54:28.302 --> 54:30.503
Yeah, it looks like we
have a winner.

54:30.537 --> 54:33.708
Your father had the same
kind of flash drive.

54:34.976 --> 54:36.043
Flushed it down the toilet,

54:37.577 --> 54:40.247
just before I shoved his fucking
face in afterwards.

55:04.604 --> 55:05.272
Marco!

55:06.606 --> 55:07.241
Marco!

55:07.274 --> 55:09.642
Niko, Niko I'm down here!

55:15.615 --> 55:17.550
Marco, are you okay?

55:17.584 --> 55:18.219
Marco.

55:20.821 --> 55:22.890
Marco, you need a doctor.

55:23.656 --> 55:24.125
You bring the truck?

55:24.158 --> 55:25.259
Yeah.

55:25.292 --> 55:28.229
Okay, there's a knife up there
on the table, get it.

55:28.262 --> 55:29.997
You need to cut me out.

55:37.772 --> 55:38.638
Who's that?

55:41.641 --> 55:43.543
It's the FBI pig who
killed father.

55:47.614 --> 55:49.183
He told you he killed papa?

55:49.216 --> 55:51.852
Yes, he was sniffing around
for the five million.

55:52.953 --> 55:54.188
Five million?

55:54.221 --> 55:57.258
Father left it to me,
money for the war.

55:57.291 --> 55:58.159
Marco you need a doctor,

55:58.192 --> 55:59.994
I have to take you to
the hospital.

56:00.027 --> 56:00.995
No, no, no.

56:01.028 --> 56:03.364
Yes, my girls aunt has a clinic,
I can take you.

56:03.397 --> 56:06.699
You see those two bags up there?

56:06.734 --> 56:10.037
That's the special surprise
firework for the Americans.

56:10.071 --> 56:11.705
We have to put them in the
truck, come on.

56:14.275 --> 56:15.109
Help me.

56:33.693 --> 56:34.694
Aunt Jenny.

56:35.662 --> 56:37.098
Hey Niko.

56:37.131 --> 56:38.732
I need your help.

56:38.766 --> 56:39.800
What's wrong, did something
happen to Tillie?

56:39.834 --> 56:40.768
No, no.

56:40.801 --> 56:42.837
One of the cab drivers had
a bad accident.

56:42.870 --> 56:44.371
He's a friend, he
needs your help.

56:44.405 --> 56:46.639
Yes, okay.

56:46.673 --> 56:47.308
Do you need a hospital?

56:47.341 --> 56:48.742
We're pretty limited here.

56:50.711 --> 56:51.779
He's not legal.

56:53.013 --> 56:53.881
You understand?

56:55.182 --> 56:56.383
I see.

56:56.417 --> 56:57.985
Okay Niko bring him in,
let's have a look.

56:58.018 --> 56:58.886
Okay.

57:02.423 --> 57:04.024
This is aunt Jenny, we
can trust her.

57:05.392 --> 57:08.329
You'll find we have much better
stuff for pain here.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.068
It's Tillie.

57:15.102 --> 57:17.404
Good, you go out and
talk to her.

57:17.438 --> 57:19.039
I'll take care of your friend.

57:22.843 --> 57:25.713
What sort of accident did we
have fireworks, right?

57:26.847 --> 57:28.048
Yes, fireworks.

57:29.083 --> 57:30.985
Maybe that's why
they're illegal.

57:31.018 --> 57:32.353
Let's have a look.

57:32.386 --> 57:33.454
Careful.

57:37.758 --> 57:39.692
This is serious.

57:39.727 --> 57:41.395
You're going to need the ER
at mass general.

57:41.428 --> 57:43.063
Oh no, no ER.

57:48.836 --> 57:49.937
I know you're illegal,

57:49.970 --> 57:52.006
but we're going to have to call
an airlift for you.

59:21.495 --> 59:23.297
It's okay Tillie.

59:23.330 --> 59:25.299
No, it's not okay.

59:25.332 --> 59:28.869
A friend of my fathers showed my
aunt the picture of the man

59:28.902 --> 59:33.974
and he said he killed my parents
now he's trying to kill us.

59:34.008 --> 59:35.309
He killed your parents?

59:37.411 --> 59:39.079
Okay, okay, stay where you are,

59:39.113 --> 59:40.981
I'll be there as soon as I can,
okay?

59:44.985 --> 59:45.819
Okay, bye.

59:51.959 --> 59:53.327
Wait stop, he's my brother!

59:59.566 --> 1:00:00.434
Marco!

1:00:15.082 --> 1:00:16.884
She didn't do anything.

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:17.851
She recognized me.

1:00:18.619 --> 1:00:20.254
She has a picture on her phone.

1:00:22.956 --> 1:00:23.824
She was a good woman.

1:00:25.192 --> 1:00:27.895
Are you fucking blind, this
bitch tried to kill me.

1:00:29.029 --> 1:00:31.332
Is this how easily you deceived?

1:00:31.365 --> 1:00:34.568
Marco you need a hospital,
we need a hospital.

1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:43.310
No, we need to get back to the
boat and get the money.

1:00:43.344 --> 1:00:44.645
We can't leave her.

1:00:44.678 --> 1:00:47.481
We only need one more day,
come on help me.

1:00:47.514 --> 1:00:48.382
Help me.

1:00:49.616 --> 1:00:51.085
Niko!

1:00:51.118 --> 1:00:52.086
Help me!

1:01:00.928 --> 1:01:03.497
No, wait, wait, get the phone.

1:01:03.530 --> 1:01:04.398
Get the phone.

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:07.534
Wait.

1:01:15.342 --> 1:01:17.511
What are you doing?

1:01:17.544 --> 1:01:19.646
Niko leave that bitch.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:20.547
Niko!

1:01:23.550 --> 1:01:25.519
Niko, we're running out of time,
come on.

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:36.163
Hey Tillie, how would you
describe this shade of red?

1:01:37.464 --> 1:01:41.101
Call it fuck me now, deep red.

1:01:44.438 --> 1:01:45.572
I think you got a text.

1:01:47.541 --> 1:01:48.442
It might be Niko.

1:01:58.318 --> 1:02:02.523
Did you figure out what you're
wearing for him yet?

1:02:03.524 --> 1:02:04.391
Till?

1:02:06.193 --> 1:02:08.996
Whatever, new boy toy, I get it.

1:02:11.498 --> 1:02:12.433
[Answering Machine] Hi
this is Niko,

1:02:12.466 --> 1:02:14.368
please leave a message.

1:02:14.401 --> 1:02:15.536
Niko, please call me.

1:02:18.138 --> 1:02:19.006
Please.

1:02:37.057 --> 1:02:37.725
Oh.

1:02:54.508 --> 1:02:55.676
You're burning up.

1:02:57.779 --> 1:02:59.146
It's Lou, he's a friend.

1:03:00.214 --> 1:03:01.682
Everything has to seem normal.

1:03:07.254 --> 1:03:09.022
Niko, my man.

1:03:09.056 --> 1:03:12.559
Tomorrow promises festivities
of epic proportions.

1:03:12.593 --> 1:03:14.194
And am I correct in believing

1:03:14.228 --> 1:03:16.363
I just witnessed you by
Island Liquors?

1:03:18.265 --> 1:03:20.033
I'm stocking up on booze.

1:03:20.067 --> 1:03:22.135
And what about the uh.

1:03:22.169 --> 1:03:24.104
Yes, I have what you want.

1:03:24.137 --> 1:03:25.405
Yes.

1:03:25.439 --> 1:03:26.640
You are indeed the man.

1:03:36.250 --> 1:03:39.219
You have to take the money off
the boat and hide it.

1:03:39.253 --> 1:03:41.088
Other martyrs will
contact you soon.

1:03:41.756 --> 1:03:43.290
What?

1:03:43.323 --> 1:03:44.124
Marco, who?

1:03:44.157 --> 1:03:45.192
To Nantucket?

1:03:45.225 --> 1:03:46.393
Yes, Nantucket.

1:03:46.426 --> 1:03:48.695
The timer is set to
go off 12 noon.

1:03:50.297 --> 1:03:51.298
You know what to do.

1:04:01.241 --> 1:04:04.444
Whoa, pre fourth of July
face plant already.

1:04:09.583 --> 1:04:12.419
A sad exhibition when a man
doesn't know his limits.

1:04:30.370 --> 1:04:31.271
You need a doctor.

1:04:31.305 --> 1:04:32.040
No.

1:04:46.553 --> 1:04:47.822
Who are you calling?

1:04:47.855 --> 1:04:49.122
You should be quiet.

1:04:53.293 --> 1:04:54.595
Hey Tillie.

1:04:54.628 --> 1:04:56.129
Sorry, I missed your call,
my phone was dead.

1:04:56.163 --> 1:04:57.230
Is everything okay?

1:04:57.264 --> 1:04:59.499
I'm here at my aunts clinic,

1:04:59.533 --> 1:05:01.869
her bikes here, but the
clinic's closed.

1:05:03.637 --> 1:05:04.504
It's not right.

1:05:06.340 --> 1:05:07.207
Where are you?

1:05:10.644 --> 1:05:12.346
I am outside Island Liquors.

1:05:14.749 --> 1:05:17.184
Can you meet me at the clinic?

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:19.653
Okay, stay where you were, I'll
be there as soon as I can.

1:05:21.655 --> 1:05:22.857
Niko, no, no.

1:05:24.224 --> 1:05:25.692
We need to get this boat
back to the beach,

1:05:25.727 --> 1:05:27.661
I can't do it on my own, I
need your help.

1:05:27.694 --> 1:05:30.464
I understand, but I
need to go now.

1:05:30.497 --> 1:05:31.866
Everything I have done
till this point

1:05:31.899 --> 1:05:33.835
cannot be for nothing, you
understand that?

1:05:33.868 --> 1:05:36.136
Yes, I'll be back soon.

1:05:40.273 --> 1:05:41.141
Niko.

1:05:42.476 --> 1:05:43.343
Niko!

1:05:44.277 --> 1:05:45.145
Niko!

1:05:52.686 --> 1:05:54.956
Her bike is still here Chris.

1:05:54.989 --> 1:05:55.857
She probably took cab.

1:05:57.424 --> 1:05:59.927
Listen, we're swamped here,
I gotta go.

1:06:08.635 --> 1:06:09.503
Tillie.

1:06:10.437 --> 1:06:11.706
I'm freaking out.

1:06:11.739 --> 1:06:12.907
It hasn't been long, honestly,

1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:13.875
and there's so many crazy things

1:06:13.908 --> 1:06:15.575
happening before the fourth.

1:06:15.609 --> 1:06:17.845
I've called, I've texted,
nothing.

1:06:17.879 --> 1:06:20.480
She wouldn't just leave
her bike here.

1:06:26.486 --> 1:06:28.255
Niko, do you know this guy?

1:06:36.596 --> 1:06:37.464
No.

1:06:41.769 --> 1:06:42.837
Sorry to bother you.

1:06:44.271 --> 1:06:46.440
I know you have to get
back to work.

1:06:46.473 --> 1:06:48.710
Tillie, it's no trouble,
honestly.

1:06:48.743 --> 1:06:50.544
You just go, it's okay.

1:07:03.523 --> 1:07:04.624
[Answering Machine] This is
Richard Cantrell,

1:07:04.658 --> 1:07:05.659
I'm not available right now.

1:07:05.692 --> 1:07:09.362
Please contact my partner
Agent Hanley at 555.

1:07:12.399 --> 1:07:14.401
Spare no peperoni good sir.

1:07:15.837 --> 1:07:20.440
What, have we had enough of the
tea and biscuits me Lord?

1:07:20.474 --> 1:07:21.909
Stuff it Henry.

1:07:28.082 --> 1:07:31.318
Niko, my good man,
about tomorrow.

1:07:31.351 --> 1:07:33.020
Yes, I told you, I
got you covered.

1:07:33.054 --> 1:07:34.521
Listen I need you to
do me a favor.

1:07:34.554 --> 1:07:35.857
Can you call Tillie?

1:07:35.890 --> 1:07:37.290
Can you enlighten me please?

1:07:38.558 --> 1:07:41.829
A boundless fountain of
olive oil and vinegar.

1:07:41.863 --> 1:07:43.831
Her aunt is missing and she
needs to calm down, okay?

1:07:43.865 --> 1:07:45.800
I have to work tonight.

1:07:45.833 --> 1:07:49.003
Oh yes, aunt Jenny, a
previous source

1:07:49.036 --> 1:07:50.670
of numerous episodes of
disconnection.

1:07:52.073 --> 1:07:54.942
Related directly to the effects
of excessive alcohol.

1:07:56.077 --> 1:07:59.613
But no fear, I will find
her drunken soul.

1:07:59.646 --> 1:08:01.581
Yeah, just call her, okay.

1:08:02.850 --> 1:08:04.551
Okay, bye.

1:08:33.513 --> 1:08:34.381
You okay?

1:08:37.450 --> 1:08:40.755
Pretty good view for the
fireworks, no?

1:08:42.455 --> 1:08:44.926
I'm okay, don't worry about me.

1:08:46.127 --> 1:08:48.361
You need to take the
money and go.

1:08:48.395 --> 1:08:50.463
It's under there,
under the bunk.

1:08:52.834 --> 1:08:55.702
Father worked hard to raise that
money for our cause.

1:08:59.974 --> 1:09:03.343
We owe it to those who gave to
continue the war.

1:09:07.048 --> 1:09:08.749
Marco, you could still go away.

1:09:10.450 --> 1:09:11.752
No.

1:09:11.786 --> 1:09:14.755
She's father's final glory,
you go.

1:09:14.789 --> 1:09:16.023
You make us proud.

1:09:17.859 --> 1:09:20.027
And when it's finished
just disappear.

1:09:21.729 --> 1:09:22.997
You did not know this.

1:09:24.631 --> 1:09:26.700
Father was trained by
the Americans

1:09:26.734 --> 1:09:29.770
to do their dirty work overseas.

1:09:29.804 --> 1:09:34.008
He fought his Muslim brothers on
the promise of a visa.

1:09:34.041 --> 1:09:36.610
Better life, education for you.

1:09:37.979 --> 1:09:38.846
But they betrayed him.

1:09:39.947 --> 1:09:42.549
This so called nation
of immigrants,

1:09:44.819 --> 1:09:46.053
they denied the visa.

1:09:48.189 --> 1:09:50.091
They sent our mother
back home in shame

1:09:50.124 --> 1:09:52.525
where she was stoned to death.

1:09:52.559 --> 1:09:54.694
I wish that you had come with me
and father to London,

1:09:54.729 --> 1:09:57.098
and not America with mother.

1:09:57.131 --> 1:09:57.798
But mama.

1:09:57.832 --> 1:09:59.834
So tomorrow you will remind them

1:09:59.867 --> 1:10:02.837
of the cost of
arrogance and greed.

1:10:02.870 --> 1:10:04.872
And of what it feels like to
have death come from no where.

1:10:04.906 --> 1:10:07.174
Is that all you feel now Marco?

1:10:09.542 --> 1:10:11.411
The need to hate and punish?

1:10:13.546 --> 1:10:15.082
We're not that
different to them.

1:10:16.083 --> 1:10:17.885
And mama, she loved it here.

1:10:17.919 --> 1:10:18.920
She didn't go back in shame,

1:10:18.953 --> 1:10:21.789
she went back to get a legal
visa to stay here.

1:10:24.624 --> 1:10:26.426
If only you could
feel what I feel,

1:10:28.896 --> 1:10:33.466
but I had my America, and
you never did.

1:10:39.173 --> 1:10:42.977
Don't be a fool don't
listen to their lies.

1:10:44.678 --> 1:10:46.981
Our course is true.

1:10:47.014 --> 1:10:50.885
Your family is through your
brother, its true.

1:10:53.955 --> 1:10:57.657
You're legacy to this
day and to me.

1:10:57.691 --> 1:10:58.960
That is your oath.

1:11:00.995 --> 1:11:04.698
You understand me little
brother, that is your oath.

1:11:07.268 --> 1:11:08.668
You understand?

1:11:09.904 --> 1:11:10.771
Now go.

1:11:13.007 --> 1:11:15.109
Do your duty, go.

1:13:23.938 --> 1:13:24.805
Chris.

1:13:26.073 --> 1:13:28.641
I got back at three am, she
still wasn't home.

1:13:30.211 --> 1:13:31.345
Okay.

1:13:31.378 --> 1:13:35.648
It's crazy, I can't get a hold
of anybody at the clinic.

1:13:35.682 --> 1:13:37.852
No one is picking up the phone.

1:13:37.885 --> 1:13:40.254
I hope she didn't fall
off the wagon.

1:13:40.287 --> 1:13:43.290
Called the police, they're over
run with the beach party.

1:13:43.324 --> 1:13:45.392
I don't know what else to do.

1:13:45.426 --> 1:13:46.327
Thanks Chris.

1:13:56.303 --> 1:13:58.671
Yeah, I just wish it
was you and I.

1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:01.175
Not into big crowds.

1:14:02.977 --> 1:14:03.844
In fact when we get there

1:14:03.878 --> 1:14:05.980
can we just take a walk
or something?

1:14:09.049 --> 1:14:11.218
Okay.

1:14:39.146 --> 1:14:40.314
Niko my man.

1:14:40.347 --> 1:14:41.315
Hey.

1:14:41.348 --> 1:14:43.751
Are the goods in one of
these oh so hipster,

1:14:43.784 --> 1:14:44.451
Yeti cooler bags?

1:14:44.485 --> 1:14:45.819
Now hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:14:48.389 --> 1:14:50.257
You gotta watch out for all the
undercover cops around here.

1:14:50.291 --> 1:14:52.793
Don't want the party to end too
soon now, do we Lou?

1:14:52.826 --> 1:14:54.395
Prudence is wise.

1:14:54.428 --> 1:14:56.830
Don't you judge me, to bring
your delicate young canine

1:14:56.864 --> 1:14:59.500
to a beach prime for
numerous loud explosions.

1:14:59.533 --> 1:15:00.401
Not so much.

1:15:02.436 --> 1:15:03.837
All right, I'll see you soon.

1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:08.242
I think Lou likes the puppy.

1:15:09.243 --> 1:15:11.879
Oh my God.

1:15:11.912 --> 1:15:13.314
Wait, who is this?

1:15:15.416 --> 1:15:17.284
Precious little thing.

1:15:19.787 --> 1:15:21.121
She's a present from Niko.

1:15:23.824 --> 1:15:24.491
Hi.

1:15:26.527 --> 1:15:29.129
Whoa, and I thought my outfit
would get attention.

1:15:29.163 --> 1:15:31.932
This is gonna be ridiculous.

1:15:31.966 --> 1:15:33.300
I'm gonna get something
out of the truck.

1:15:33.334 --> 1:15:34.201
Okay.

1:15:37.504 --> 1:15:39.473
What have we got here.

1:15:39.506 --> 1:15:40.374
A puppy.

1:15:40.407 --> 1:15:41.809
Can I pet him.

1:15:41.842 --> 1:15:42.876
Him is a her.

1:15:44.111 --> 1:15:45.212
She's almost as
beautiful as you.

1:15:45.246 --> 1:15:46.947
Aw, you're charming.

1:15:46.981 --> 1:15:47.815
I try.

1:15:58.058 --> 1:16:01.095
So Niko, can you
confirm who owns

1:16:01.128 --> 1:16:02.263
that glorious yacht off shore

1:16:02.296 --> 1:16:04.999
and explain why your dear
friends have been denied access?

1:16:05.032 --> 1:16:05.899
Just a second Lou.

1:16:05.933 --> 1:16:06.800
What yacht?

1:16:08.035 --> 1:16:09.803
The same yacht I saw your
Romeo escorting

1:16:09.837 --> 1:16:10.838
another fellow
aboard last night.

1:16:10.871 --> 1:16:12.273
You saw Niko there?

1:16:13.874 --> 1:16:16.410
Entwined with a gentleman and
instinctively navigating

1:16:16.443 --> 1:16:18.312
his way aboard as if
returning home.

1:16:21.081 --> 1:16:22.182
I'm going for a swim.

1:16:24.285 --> 1:16:26.153
Tell Felicity to watch
the puppy, okay?

1:16:26.186 --> 1:16:29.857
Shouldn't be a problem, hey,
hey that's my board!

1:16:49.476 --> 1:16:52.379
Has the hour arrived to spark up
some fine central Oregon?

1:16:52.413 --> 1:16:53.981
Where's Tillie?

1:16:54.014 --> 1:16:55.949
Oh our dear flower
impulsively decided

1:16:55.983 --> 1:16:58.385
to paddle toward your well
endowed friends boat.

1:16:58.419 --> 1:17:00.220
Perhaps planning an
offshore rendezvous.

1:17:01.255 --> 1:17:02.122
No, no.

1:17:53.974 --> 1:17:54.675
Tillie!

1:18:05.519 --> 1:18:06.387
Tillie!

1:18:09.456 --> 1:18:11.925
It's your friend isn't it?

1:18:14.328 --> 1:18:15.262
You lied to me!

1:18:15.295 --> 1:18:17.998
No, it's my brother.

1:18:18.031 --> 1:18:18.999
Your brother?

1:18:23.237 --> 1:18:24.304
Your brother?

1:18:25.172 --> 1:18:26.540
Did he kill my parents?

1:18:26.573 --> 1:18:27.408
I don't know.

1:18:30.477 --> 1:18:32.279
Where's aunt Jenny?

1:18:33.247 --> 1:18:34.148
Marco was hurt.

1:18:35.449 --> 1:18:37.351
I took him to your aunt.

1:18:37.384 --> 1:18:40.120
She was trying to help, I didn't
know what he would do.

1:18:40.154 --> 1:18:41.155
Oh my God.

1:18:42.156 --> 1:18:42.990
Oh my God.

1:18:43.023 --> 1:18:44.224
Tillie, Tillie.

1:18:46.728 --> 1:18:47.594
Marco.

1:18:50.732 --> 1:18:51.598
Wait.

1:18:54.769 --> 1:18:56.470
Please Tillie, you shouldn't be,
you shouldn't be here.

1:18:56.503 --> 1:18:58.105
Why, why my parents?

1:18:58.138 --> 1:19:00.274
What did we ever do to you?

1:19:00.307 --> 1:19:02.376
When else were you and
your brother doing?

1:19:05.512 --> 1:19:07.614
I had a family to, Marco
was all I had left.

1:19:07.648 --> 1:19:09.049
Aunt Jenny was all I had left.

1:19:10.417 --> 1:19:13.086
You made me believe like I was
getting my life back.

1:19:14.789 --> 1:19:16.390
Stupid, stupid me!

1:19:18.492 --> 1:19:20.194
What else were you doing?

1:19:22.563 --> 1:19:25.265
Marco put bombs in the cooler
bags on the truck.

1:19:25.299 --> 1:19:26.667
No Tillie wait, wait,
Tillie wait,

1:19:26.700 --> 1:19:28.368
just let me explain Tillie.

1:19:30.604 --> 1:19:31.438
But.

1:19:32.473 --> 1:19:34.408
Tillie, Tillie, Tillie.

1:20:03.370 --> 1:20:04.238
Niko!

1:21:37.431 --> 1:21:39.566
There's a bomb, there's a bomb!

1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:41.869
A bomb, move, there's a bomb!

1:21:41.903 --> 1:21:45.205
No bomb, look, just champaign
and a little weed.

1:21:45.238 --> 1:21:47.641
Listen, ow officer, come on!

1:21:47.674 --> 1:21:49.777
He's right, he's right, no bomb.

1:21:49.811 --> 1:21:51.478
Just a cooler full of champaign.

1:21:54.448 --> 1:21:56.316
Tillie, I'm Agent Hanley.

1:21:58.853 --> 1:21:59.887
We found your aunt.

1:21:59.921 --> 1:22:04.424
I'm so sorry, thank God you're
here in one piece.

1:22:04.458 --> 1:22:06.259
Now we got here as
fast as we could.

1:22:06.293 --> 1:22:07.294
Where's the suspect?

1:22:09.964 --> 1:22:11.131
Dead on the boat.

1:22:11.966 --> 1:22:13.200
And your boyfriend?

1:22:15.937 --> 1:22:17.237
Bottom of the sea.

1:22:20.942 --> 1:22:24.746
Your godfather, my partner,
Agent Cantrell?

1:22:24.779 --> 1:22:27.614
We got an anonymous call to 911
with his location.

1:22:28.783 --> 1:22:32.686
We found him at the marina
on a small boat.

1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:34.822
He's in critical condition
at Mass General.

1:22:36.490 --> 1:22:37.691
He just might make it.

1:22:41.829 --> 1:22:43.363
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1:22:45.332 --> 1:22:46.199
Sarge.

1:22:47.567 --> 1:22:49.436
All right, what have we got?

1:22:49.469 --> 1:22:51.939
Well both coolers are just
filled with champaign and ice.

1:22:51.973 --> 1:22:54.441
Nothing consistent with an IED,
we're all clear.

1:22:54.474 --> 1:22:56.276
All right.

1:23:01.648 --> 1:23:03.517
Let's leave the truck.

1:23:36.884 --> 1:23:37.785
I'm sorry.

1:24:05.479 --> 1:24:06.814
Holy shit.

1:24:48.588 --> 1:24:50.690
Dear Tillie, I'm sorry

1:24:50.725 --> 1:24:52.659
I'm not gonna be with
you for a while.

1:24:54.461 --> 1:24:55.863
I know I've made some mistakes,

1:24:56.931 --> 1:24:58.665
and I'm prepared to
pay the price.

1:25:00.467 --> 1:25:01.769
I hope the explosion
was far enough

1:25:01.803 --> 1:25:03.470
away that nobody was hurt.

1:25:03.503 --> 1:25:06.808
I took the FBI agent to the
marina and called 911.

1:25:06.841 --> 1:25:07.775
I hope he's okay.

1:25:08.976 --> 1:25:11.511
I'm so sorry about aunt Jenny.

1:25:11.545 --> 1:25:14.581
She was so kind and I
felt safe with her.

1:25:14.614 --> 1:25:17.752
Marco is my brother but I
didn't see it coming.

1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:20.087
She was such a good woman.

1:25:21.488 --> 1:25:23.791
I hope you can find
someway to forgive me.

1:25:23.825 --> 1:25:24.624
I'll work hard.

1:25:25.827 --> 1:25:28.963
I've decided to take your advice
and major in architecture.

1:25:28.996 --> 1:25:32.465
It was always my dream to become
an American citizen.

1:25:32.499 --> 1:25:34.501
It'll probably stay a
dream considering.

1:25:35.970 --> 1:25:38.806
My father wanted us to use
this money for war

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:40.708
but we can use it for good.

1:25:40.741 --> 1:25:43.110
I know that's what my mother
would have wanted.

1:25:43.144 --> 1:25:47.915
But I love you Tillie and
I'm loyal to you

1:25:47.949 --> 1:25:50.918
and only you for the rest of our
lives we'll spend together.

1:25:54.088 --> 1:25:55.589
I love you Tillie.
