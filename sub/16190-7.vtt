00:00.218 --> 00:02.852
I'm going home with you!

00:03.687 --> 00:04.671
Oh.

00:04.741 --> 00:09.392
Well, uh, today's not really
good for a playdate, Morgan.

00:09.461 --> 00:13.296
Oh, you have to. My mom
said you were going to.

00:13.365 --> 00:15.365
You don't have a ride home?

00:15.434 --> 00:17.701
Was she counting on me to take you with us?

00:17.770 --> 00:19.402
Uh-huh.

00:19.471 --> 00:21.738
O... kay.

00:21.807 --> 00:24.708
Well, just wait here, I guess.

00:24.777 --> 00:26.576
I gotta go get Duke.

Hello. Trinity?

01:00.179 --> 01:02.312
Hi, yes. Is this Samantha?

01:02.381 --> 01:04.647
Oh, it's just Sam.

01:04.715 --> 01:06.483
Uh, did you tell Morgan

01:06.552 --> 01:08.185
that we would take her home with us today?

01:08.253 --> 01:10.487
Oh, could you? That would be great.

01:10.556 --> 01:13.590
She said you already told
her that I'm going to,

01:13.659 --> 01:15.325
so now she's expecting me to.

01:15.394 --> 01:17.360
Is it a problem? I am nowhere near there.

01:17.429 --> 01:19.696
So if I have to come, it's
gonna be pretty difficult.

01:19.765 --> 01:20.997
I'll have to rearrange my day.

01:21.066 --> 01:22.933
Uh...

01:23.001 --> 01:24.935
[sighs] Yeah, it's fine.

01:25.003 --> 01:27.170
It's just... [sighs]

01:27.239 --> 01:31.041
Can you please pick her up at my
house, please, before six? Okay?

01:31.109 --> 01:33.109
Six? Oh.

01:33.178 --> 01:35.445
Well, you know what? That's fine.

01:35.514 --> 01:36.513
I can make it work.

01:36.582 --> 01:38.882
Oh, good.

01:38.951 --> 01:40.217
That's great for me.

01:40.285 --> 01:41.885

02:11.950 --> 02:16.386
- No. Mom?
- What? Do you hate it?

02:16.455 --> 02:19.756
I can tell. You wanna quit?

02:19.825 --> 02:22.025
[sighs]

02:22.094 --> 02:26.096
Okay, good, 'cause it's right
in the middle of traffic anyway.

02:26.164 --> 02:28.164
And you shouldn't come
if you're not into it.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.934
Also, I'm really excited
you're quitting chorus.

02:31.003 --> 02:33.069
Also, hi, I love you.

02:33.138 --> 02:35.906
Also, Mormon Morgan's coming home with us.

02:35.974 --> 02:38.708
Wait, what? No! You didn't even tell me.

02:38.777 --> 02:41.578
I know! No one told me, either.

02:41.647 --> 02:43.446
She and her mom trapped me into it.

02:43.515 --> 02:44.781
Honey, I know the rules,

02:44.850 --> 02:46.716
but this was, like, a force majeure.

02:46.785 --> 02:48.351
We're both screwed.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.320
Sorry.

02:51.990 --> 02:55.058
- Well, hi.
- Hi.

02:55.127 --> 02:58.194
I'm Ned. Nellie says

02:58.263 --> 03:00.230
Duke's her favorite kid in chorus.

03:00.299 --> 03:01.264
Dad!

03:05.203 --> 03:07.437
That must be Duke, right? Your daughter.

03:07.506 --> 03:10.907
Uh, yeah. Hi, I'm Sam.

03:10.976 --> 03:14.110
- You're tall.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

03:14.179 --> 03:17.414
Well, I think a playdate is in order.

03:17.482 --> 03:18.982
No.

03:19.051 --> 03:21.051
Yes, that would be...

03:21.119 --> 03:23.386
Well, I have a free afternoon now.

03:23.455 --> 03:24.721
If you want me to take Duke home,

03:24.790 --> 03:26.189
you could pick her up later.

03:28.126 --> 03:30.393
Oh, shit cock!

03:30.462 --> 03:32.329
You know, I can't,

03:32.397 --> 03:34.331
because otherwise I'd be alone

03:34.399 --> 03:35.632
with her Mormon friend Morgan,

03:35.701 --> 03:38.068
who we both hate.

03:38.136 --> 03:42.272
Um, we have prior
commitments, unfortunately.

03:42.341 --> 03:44.975
Okay, so another time.

03:45.043 --> 03:46.977
Yeah. Duke?

03:47.045 --> 03:49.312
Duke! Duke.

03:49.381 --> 03:50.513
Come here.

03:52.918 --> 03:55.352
Are you excited to have
a playdate with Nellie?

03:55.420 --> 03:58.088
Don't you wanna have
Nellie over to our house

03:58.156 --> 04:00.357
to play sometime?

04:00.425 --> 04:03.660
Uh-oh, looks like the
feeling's not mutual.

04:03.729 --> 04:04.961
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:05.030 --> 04:07.597
She's just racist.

04:23.448 --> 04:26.383
Yeah, you're supposed to love church.

04:26.451 --> 04:30.120
Also, the singing is good, and
I'm getting really good at it.

04:30.188 --> 04:33.023
Mom, Morgan says that her
church is really great.

04:33.091 --> 04:36.192
Did you know that Mormons
are really into music?

04:36.261 --> 04:38.194
No, honey, I didn't.

04:38.263 --> 04:41.564
Did you know that Mormons are
really into hating gay people?

04:41.633 --> 04:44.000
- Mom, don't!
- What?

04:44.069 --> 04:46.169
- Well...
- Be nice.

04:46.238 --> 04:48.071
Kind of they do.

04:48.140 --> 04:49.139
Not kind of.

04:52.477 --> 04:54.577
- Sam: Hi.
- Trinity: Hello.

04:54.646 --> 04:56.413
Oh, Come on in.

04:56.481 --> 04:58.715
Hi, Morgan. What are you wearing?

04:58.784 --> 05:01.351
Hi, Mom. We're pretending the Grammys,

05:01.420 --> 05:02.886
and like we're on the red carpet.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.521
She won Album of the Year.

05:04.589 --> 05:07.357
Okay. Please take that off now.

05:07.426 --> 05:09.526
We have to get home.

05:09.594 --> 05:12.095
Well, I thought it was pretty cool

05:12.164 --> 05:14.431
that she won Album of the Year.

05:14.499 --> 05:16.232
Yay!

05:18.170 --> 05:22.038
So, um, are you guys
going to the evening event?

05:22.107 --> 05:24.007
No, we don't got to those.

05:24.076 --> 05:26.209
Why not?

05:26.278 --> 05:27.544
Well, we don't drink or gamble.

05:27.612 --> 05:29.379
No hot drinks or caffeine.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.681
Oh, bummer.

05:31.750 --> 05:35.852
Well, you could always
drink air and eat paper?

05:35.921 --> 05:38.054
[chuckles]

05:38.123 --> 05:40.123
Anyway, Wednesday is family night.

05:40.192 --> 05:41.591
Oh, that's nice.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.793
What do you guys do for family night?

05:43.862 --> 05:46.429
We just stay in, and we all cook together,

05:46.498 --> 05:47.730
and we watch CSI.

05:47.799 --> 05:50.600
You let Morgan watch CSI?

05:50.669 --> 05:53.203
It's based on real-life stories.

05:53.271 --> 05:56.473
- No, totally. Duke?
- Tits out for the boys!

05:56.541 --> 05:59.375
Tits out for the boys!
Tits out for the boys!

05:59.444 --> 06:01.744
- Morgan!
- Sorry, Mom.

06:01.813 --> 06:04.781
Oh, that's from a show.
It's just silly fun.

06:04.850 --> 06:06.883
I didn't show them the show.

06:06.952 --> 06:09.919
Mom, Duke says she wants
to come to church with us.

06:09.988 --> 06:12.255
Oh, sure.

06:12.324 --> 06:14.324
Mom, you have to come, too.

06:14.392 --> 06:16.226
What?

06:16.294 --> 06:19.062
Oh, sure! Everyone is welcome.

06:19.131 --> 06:21.397
Yeah, you should come this Sunday.

06:21.466 --> 06:24.334
Oh, Sunday we have a...

06:24.402 --> 06:27.070
Frankie: We don't have
anything, Mom. Don't lie.

06:27.139 --> 06:29.405
That sounds great. Just
text my mom the data points,

06:29.474 --> 06:30.673
and we'll see you on Sunday.

06:30.742 --> 06:33.576
Great! See you all then. [chuckles]

06:33.645 --> 06:34.844
- Fun.
- Okay.

06:34.913 --> 06:37.113
- Well, good night.
- Okay.

06:37.182 --> 06:39.015
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:39.084 --> 06:40.550
Bye.

06:42.554 --> 06:44.454
- [door slams]
- Kill you.

06:44.523 --> 06:46.656
I love you too, Mom.

06:46.725 --> 06:49.192
[phone buzzing]

06:55.033 --> 06:57.000
[sighs]

06:57.068 --> 06:58.801
Hello?

06:58.870 --> 07:00.203
Lyft isn't working.

07:00.272 --> 07:03.273
Yep. I disabled the account.

07:03.341 --> 07:05.008
Why?

07:05.076 --> 07:08.311
<i>Because, honey, you abused it.</i>

07:08.380 --> 07:11.314
Last month's Lyft bill was, like, $500.

07:11.383 --> 07:13.349
So? That's not just me, Mom!

07:13.418 --> 07:15.451
Honey, take a bus.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.821
Oh, my God, Mom. I hate you.

07:18.890 --> 07:21.491
Max, do you understand

07:21.560 --> 07:23.826
that every time you say "I hate you" to me,

07:23.895 --> 07:26.629
it doesn't mean anything anymore?

07:26.698 --> 07:29.632
It, like, loses its sting, honey.

07:29.701 --> 07:33.469
No, seriously, Mom, I hate you.

07:33.538 --> 07:36.072
See? It just keeps getting less

07:36.141 --> 07:39.976
and less powerful every time you say it.

07:40.045 --> 07:43.479
If you really wanna upset me, you
gotta come up with something new.

07:43.548 --> 07:45.548
Okay, well, how about this?

07:45.617 --> 07:47.483
You're short, and you're getting old.

07:49.221 --> 07:50.486
Okay. Good one.

07:52.958 --> 07:53.890
[sighs]

07:53.959 --> 07:56.192
Hello? Anybody?

07:56.261 --> 07:58.161
Mormon Jesus? Anyone?

08:02.467 --> 08:03.499
Just...

08:03.568 --> 08:06.169
[phone buzzing]

08:06.238 --> 08:07.337
[sighs]

08:07.405 --> 08:10.773
Mom, please come pick me up.

08:10.842 --> 08:12.208
I'm sorry I said that.

08:12.277 --> 08:14.844
Why would I do that?

08:14.913 --> 08:18.514
It's getting dark, Mom. I could get raped.

08:18.583 --> 08:19.949
[sighs]

08:23.650 --> 08:25.020
Max.

08:25.971 --> 08:27.221
Max.

08:28.431 --> 08:29.530
Hey.

08:29.598 --> 08:31.398
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Defiance.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.734
- Where's my Max?
- She's over there, I think.

08:33.803 --> 08:37.104
Okay. Thank you. Say hi to your mom.

08:37.173 --> 08:38.138
Okay.

08:45.548 --> 08:47.948
Max!

08:48.017 --> 08:51.318
Get off of the boy and
come with me right now!

You wanted me to see that.

09:13.809 --> 09:16.176
See what?

09:16.245 --> 09:18.946
Max, what is it?

09:19.014 --> 09:20.948
What did I do?

09:21.016 --> 09:22.850
Tell me what you want me to do.

09:22.918 --> 09:27.187
It's like you're fighting me every second.

09:27.256 --> 09:29.456
And I don't even know
what surrender looks like.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.191
And I don't want this.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.293
I really don't.

09:33.362 --> 09:35.162
So tell me what you want me to do.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.333
I'm trying...

09:39.401 --> 09:42.703
and it hurts me that you're not.

09:42.771 --> 09:46.306
Oh, my God, Mom! Don't start crying!

09:46.375 --> 09:47.708
Jesus!

09:50.412 --> 09:52.145
What?

09:52.214 --> 09:54.281
Yeah, it's like you said
earlier on the phone, Mom,

09:54.350 --> 09:56.149
about me saying I hate you.

09:56.218 --> 09:58.151
Yeah, well, same with you crying.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.887
You're wearing it out.

10:06.061 --> 10:10.964
So if there's no Lyft anymore,

10:11.033 --> 10:12.966
how am I getting to
band practice on Sunday?

10:13.035 --> 10:15.168
Hmm?

10:15.237 --> 10:17.804
You're not.

10:17.873 --> 10:19.273
What do you mean?

10:21.944 --> 10:25.879
Because on Sunday, you're going
to church with me and your sisters.

10:25.948 --> 10:28.348
- Okay?
- Oh, okay, right.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.716
Yeah.

10:32.154 --> 10:33.921
Mm-hmm.

10:33.989 --> 10:36.590
Going to church.

10:36.659 --> 10:40.494
I didn't even know there
was a church in here.

10:40.563 --> 10:42.362
Oh, we don't really have churches.

10:42.431 --> 10:44.197
We have meeting houses.

10:44.266 --> 10:46.500
We share the space with
an Episcopal brotherhood.

10:46.569 --> 10:48.702
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:48.771 --> 10:52.205
It's very different from a lot of
religions you might compare it to.

10:52.274 --> 10:54.041
The bishop who's running the service

10:54.109 --> 10:56.009
isn't any different from any other member.

10:56.078 --> 10:58.612
He's just the one who leads the service.

10:58.681 --> 11:02.049
Uh, nobody really works for
the Mormon church full time.

11:02.117 --> 11:04.084
We all do it together.

11:04.153 --> 11:05.886
Oh, Good morning, Bishop Allen.

11:05.955 --> 11:07.921
Sam, this is my husband Mark.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.423
Oh, hi.

11:09.491 --> 11:10.857
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

11:10.926 --> 11:12.459
Nice to meet you. This is my daughter Max.

11:12.528 --> 11:14.261
Hmm.

11:14.330 --> 11:17.030
Well, not really dressed
for church, are we?

11:20.469 --> 11:21.635
- Shall we?
- Hmm.

11:25.641 --> 11:30.277
- That's your husband?
- [sighs] Yep.

11:30.346 --> 11:31.945
All right.

11:35.384 --> 11:37.784
Where's, like, the big cross?

11:37.853 --> 11:40.787
We don't believe in having crosses.

11:40.856 --> 11:42.756
Oh.

11:42.825 --> 11:45.459
It's disrespectful to see
where our father rested.

11:45.527 --> 11:49.496
Why? Because he had nails and
stuff in his hands and feet?

11:49.565 --> 11:52.299
No offense.

11:52.368 --> 11:54.835
We don't like to see him in pain.

11:54.903 --> 11:57.971
Oh, I just thought there was always

11:58.040 --> 12:00.240
a Jesus on a cross in a church.

12:00.309 --> 12:02.776
This is the way. We keep him off of it.

12:02.845 --> 12:04.578
We don't need the reminders.

12:04.647 --> 12:07.014
- Oh, my God.
- [spits]

12:24.533 --> 12:25.699
Shh.

12:29.171 --> 12:30.871
- [knocks]
- Hello?

12:33.175 --> 12:34.408
Hello.

12:48.023 --> 12:49.956
Man: Good morning. Good morning, everyone.

12:50.025 --> 12:52.659
That's the one my
sister's supposed to marry.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.695
What?

12:54.763 --> 12:58.231
And that's the one my other
sister's going to marry.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.301
- Oh.
- We're not gonna live our full lives.

13:01.370 --> 13:02.903
What do you mean?

13:02.971 --> 13:04.871
Well, He is coming.

13:04.940 --> 13:06.573
Who?

13:06.642 --> 13:09.209
The Lord, silly.

13:09.278 --> 13:11.211
But why?

13:11.280 --> 13:13.480
Can't we keep being alive

13:13.549 --> 13:15.415
even if the Jesus is coming?

13:15.484 --> 13:18.418
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

13:18.487 --> 13:19.786
[spits]

13:23.792 --> 13:26.593

- [kids playing]

14:02.174 --> 14:03.570
[huffs]

14:05.577 --> 14:09.345
- So that was...
- Boring?

14:09.414 --> 14:11.047
Yeah. [chuckles]

14:20.558 --> 14:22.859
Sorry you were bored, Sam.

14:22.927 --> 14:24.894
You sure did seem uncomfortable.

14:24.963 --> 14:28.164
One would think that you went in
with all kinds of preconceived notions

14:28.233 --> 14:32.235
about what a Mormon is, and that you
held on to them no matter what you saw.

14:32.303 --> 14:35.705
Oh, my God, Trinity. I don't
have anything against...

14:35.773 --> 14:40.610
I mean, besides the fact that
Mormons hate gays and black people.

14:40.678 --> 14:43.212
- That's...
- That's ignorant and cheap.

14:43.281 --> 14:47.216
Those are my two middle
names. I don't care.

14:47.285 --> 14:51.921
- You're very judgmental.
- And you're not?

14:51.990 --> 14:54.724
Okay. I can be sometimes.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.359
Yes, you can.

14:56.427 --> 14:59.562
I feel you judging me
and my girls all the time.

14:59.631 --> 15:02.531
Okay, that's fair.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.635
Well, maybe at times,
some judging is in order.

15:05.703 --> 15:10.806
- Look at your oldest... Max?
- What about her?

15:10.875 --> 15:13.943
You think that's okay?

15:15.847 --> 15:17.480
No, Trinity, I don't think

15:17.548 --> 15:20.383
that my teenaged daughter is okay, okay?

15:20.451 --> 15:23.219
None of that is okay.

15:23.288 --> 15:26.989
But wait until Morgan gets to be her age.

15:27.058 --> 15:29.458
The problem with you church people

15:29.527 --> 15:33.262
is that you like to pretend
that shit isn't the way it is.

15:33.331 --> 15:35.765
And, like, that's gonna fix it?

15:35.833 --> 15:38.601
That's a teenager, and, yeah, she's a mess.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.304
And I'm failing completely.

15:41.372 --> 15:46.742
And I don't need God or
Jesus or you to tell me that.

15:46.811 --> 15:49.078
And by the way, you wanna judge me?

15:49.147 --> 15:53.282
How about you dumping your
daughter on me on Friday

15:53.351 --> 15:54.817
without any warning,

15:54.886 --> 15:57.753
and then when I call
you, you don't say sorry

15:57.822 --> 15:59.989
or even acknowledge the bullshit

16:00.058 --> 16:03.526
passive-aggressive power
play you pulled on me, okay?

16:03.594 --> 16:05.294
And whatever, Trinity.

16:05.363 --> 16:08.631
But courtesy is something
that you owe everyone,

16:08.700 --> 16:10.533
and you owe a lot.

16:14.238 --> 16:17.306
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.041
Oh, shit. What?

16:19.110 --> 16:22.178
I'm sorry. I was gonna call you.

16:22.246 --> 16:23.312
I was.

16:23.381 --> 16:25.681
Trinity, it's not a big deal.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.950
I was just titting your tat over here.

16:28.019 --> 16:32.221
Friday was the worst day.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.991
It was?

16:35.059 --> 16:37.059
What happened?

16:37.128 --> 16:39.095
What happened Friday, Trinity?

16:41.632 --> 16:44.066
I was... I was at a meeting

16:44.135 --> 16:46.736
with Mark and the church leader.

16:46.804 --> 16:50.573
Our marriage is not good.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.011
Oh. Sure.

16:55.079 --> 16:57.513
Sam?

16:57.582 --> 16:59.181
Shit.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.384
Shit?

17:01.452 --> 17:03.252
Yes.

17:04.888 --> 17:07.423
I envy you.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.760
Being a Mormon, it's just about
impossible to get a divorce.

17:10.828 --> 17:14.329
There's all this pressure to make it work.

17:14.398 --> 17:18.166
We have to keep up a fucking front.

17:18.236 --> 17:22.637
Uh-oh. I like this Trinity.

17:24.442 --> 17:27.510
And he's so hateful.

17:27.578 --> 17:30.913
We're both cheating,
but somehow it's just me.

17:33.184 --> 17:34.350
God.

17:34.419 --> 17:38.254
And Morgan is so demanding.

17:38.322 --> 17:41.524
And she has all kind of issues and...

17:41.592 --> 17:44.126
I can't do it.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.530
Honey, it's okay.

17:47.598 --> 17:50.266
It's okay.

17:50.334 --> 17:52.535
I can't do it, either.

17:52.603 --> 17:56.072
You don't have to do it. You don't have to.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.040
You just...

17:58.109 --> 18:01.577
You get up and you do your best.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.345
Trinity.

18:06.551 --> 18:07.683
Hmm?

18:10.988 --> 18:12.121
Dude.

18:23.597 --> 18:24.741
[sighs]

18:24.788 --> 18:27.505
- Well, that proves it.
- What?

18:27.574 --> 18:31.276
- There is no God.
- Yeah.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.112
- He would have been there today.
- [chuckles]

18:34.181 --> 18:35.914
I'm so tired.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.349
- Was that so much fun?
- Yeah.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.352
- Did you have a good time with Morgan?
- Yeah.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.488
See? Remember?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.089
We didn't even wanna
have a playdate with her,

18:45.158 --> 18:46.458
and look how nice.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.493
You made a new friend even.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.295
Yup.

18:50.363 --> 18:54.098
So, like, maybe we
should be more open about

18:54.167 --> 18:57.335
who, uh, we have playdates with.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.305
Like, you know, what
about that girl Nellie?

19:00.373 --> 19:01.639
What?

19:01.708 --> 19:04.509
I think it would be
nice to have Nellie over.

19:04.578 --> 19:07.512
- Who's Nellie?
- The girl from chorus, honey.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.647
Which girl?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.549
The black one, baby.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.185
The one who asked you
for a playdate on Friday.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.055
No, they didn't. Her dad did.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.492
No, he asked for her.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.127
No, he didn't. He asked
'cause he likes you.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.396
- I'm tired.
- What?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.732
Wait. Why did you say that?

19:27.801 --> 19:30.201
- About what?
- About Nellie's dad?

19:30.270 --> 19:33.037
- I don't know. Can I have my pet in bed?
- No, Honey.

19:33.106 --> 19:34.873
- Honey?
- What?

19:34.941 --> 19:37.909
- Where's your school roster?
- I don't know.

19:37.978 --> 19:40.578
You probably have one in your
backpack. Where's your backpack?

19:40.647 --> 19:45.416
Mom, you said my backpack is private.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.652
- Private!
- I'm sorry.

19:47.721 --> 19:50.388
Are you getting your period or what?

19:50.457 --> 19:53.057
- Wash your hands.
- [footsteps departing]

19:53.126 --> 19:55.159
[phone ringing]

19:55.228 --> 19:57.362
Honey, can you go play
in your room for a minute?

19:57.430 --> 20:00.231
- [sighs]
- Quickly.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.766
[ringing continues]

20:04.271 --> 20:07.005
Sam. Hi. I'm really glad you called.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.607
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

20:09.676 --> 20:12.110
<i>Can I just say I love you?</i>

20:12.178 --> 20:15.013
You're great. Thanks for coming today.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.015
I've been feeling so much better.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.385
Oh, man, you're so welcome.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.220
You doing okay?

20:22.289 --> 20:25.623
Um, wiped out.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.259
I can't believe that
tomorrow's Monday morning.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.028
Yeah.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.564
<i>Hey, do you have the school roster?</i>

20:32.632 --> 20:33.464
Why?

20:33.533 --> 20:37.435
Oh, well, you know, um,

20:37.504 --> 20:39.370
I want to get in touch with, um,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.039
that girl, uh, Nellie.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.407
Yes. Nellie.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.742
Yeah. Do you have her mom's number?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.477
Oh, her mom died.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.414
Oh.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.450
That's... Well...

20:52.519 --> 20:53.451
Her dad?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.054
You met her dad?

20:56.122 --> 20:57.622
Oh, yeah.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.624
Um, yeah, we met after chorus,

20:59.693 --> 21:02.060
and he tried to make a playdate, and...

21:02.128 --> 21:04.295
I'll text you Ned's number.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.599
Oh, okay.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.633
Sure.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.502
- Sam?
- Yeah?

21:11.571 --> 21:15.440
Ned is very generous.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.108
What?

21:17.177 --> 21:18.776
With his cock.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.079
<i>I'm not saying don't.</i>

21:21.147 --> 21:24.849
I'm saying go ahead. I'm
trying to save you time.

21:24.918 --> 21:27.919
Just so you know, he's really fun,

21:27.988 --> 21:31.990
and he's good at going back to normal.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.426
[clears throat]

21:35.495 --> 21:37.662
Okay.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.831
Thanks.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.600
Sure. Bye.
