00:03.655 --> 00:04.004
.

00:04.047 --> 00:06.745
- This patient harms herself
to get attention.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.617
- I'm not available to give
the kind of care you need.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.271
- But I want you.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.360
[dramatic music]

00:12.403 --> 00:13.448
- Where's Ramona?

00:13.491 --> 00:15.493
Check the front.
Tell security.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.147
- Did you snow him
to force him into surgery?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.322
- Why would I do that?

00:18.366 --> 00:20.237
- I think you're suffering
from PTSD.

00:20.281 --> 00:23.240
That's why I keep pushing you
to talk to Dr. Charles.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.329
- What's going on?
Something's off.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.158
- I don't have the bandwidth
to worry about anyone else.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.464
I need some space.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.640
â™ª

00:31.683 --> 00:33.468
- The drug we're testing,

00:33.511 --> 00:36.471
any idea how it might affect
a patient with an LVAD?

00:36.514 --> 00:38.777
- If there's a patient
suffering any adverse reaction,

00:38.821 --> 00:40.605
it needs to be reported.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.738
- If we can keep
from getting caught,

00:42.781 --> 00:45.610
your mom may not ever
need a transplant.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.091
- Well, I do not want
to put you in this position.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.745
- Then let me worry about that.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.793
Hey, Sabeena.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.752
Haven't seen you
around the E.D. lately.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.537
- Haven't seen you
around the trial office.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.278
Though, I don't blame you.

01:01.322 --> 01:04.194
I have been a little hard
on you lately.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.762
- Well, I had it coming.
- It's true.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.593
- [sighs]

01:11.636 --> 01:13.725
Last round of follow-ups
going okay?

01:13.769 --> 01:15.249
- Everything looks good.

01:15.292 --> 01:18.121
A few more left to go,
and we're done.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.905
- That's great.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.169
- You know what that means,
right?

01:22.212 --> 01:25.433
- Kender starts the first stage
of data analysis.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.221
Wait.

01:31.265 --> 01:34.572
Is there still a chance,
you and me?

01:34.616 --> 01:36.792
[bell dings]
- Just a slight chance.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.403
- Well...
[laughs]

01:39.447 --> 01:41.623
In that case,
you better get to work.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.407
Come on, get upstairs.
Move it.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.280
- [laughs]

01:50.327 --> 01:52.547
- Course guide.
You going back to school?

01:52.590 --> 01:53.896
- Got my interview

01:53.939 --> 01:56.246
for Med's Nurse Practitioner
program today.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.248
I squeezed in
under the deadline.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.207
- Well, I'm sure
you'll do great.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.298
- Are you okay?

02:04.341 --> 02:07.301
You haven't seemed yourself
lately.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.824
[dramatic music]

02:08.867 --> 02:10.434
- No, I just,

02:10.478 --> 02:13.176
been, uh, working
some late nights.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.917
You know how it goes.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.659
- Okay.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.751
- Great.
Thanks.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.188
- Will, I need a little help.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.407
Where should we go?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.191
- Treatment #5.
What's going on?

02:28.235 --> 02:29.714
- I think Mom's
in liver failure.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.803
Do you think this
is from the trial meds?

02:31.847 --> 02:33.240
- I don't know.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.459
Hey, Carol.
Does your belly hurt?

02:35.503 --> 02:37.548
- Yes, it does.
[laughs]

02:38.462 --> 02:40.203
- Okay, let's get you
in the bed.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.205
- Okay.
- Come on, Mom.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.772
- Hey, Carol.

02:43.815 --> 02:47.645
- Hi.
- How you doing?

02:47.689 --> 02:51.388
- Thank you.
- Come on.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.694
- Okay.
- There you go.

02:52.737 --> 02:53.869
- Thanks, guys.
Oh.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.827
- Jaundice, edema.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.394
I think you're right.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.267
- Liver failure?

03:00.310 --> 03:01.485
How's her
cardiac function been?

03:01.529 --> 03:02.921
- You know, pretty good.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.447
- On just the standard meds?

03:06.490 --> 03:08.797
- Why?
Shouldn't it be?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.842
- Well, it's just you hadn't
been responding before,

03:10.886 --> 03:13.889
but it looks like
they're working well.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.457
- We'll need to do
a full workup.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.634
- Okay, I'll get a liver panel,
CBC, CMP, and coags.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.984
- Thanks.
- And we'll need a list

03:22.027 --> 03:24.943
of her medications as well.
- Okay.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.249
- Okay.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.772
- This could be
a drug interaction.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.557
We have to rule everything out.
- Yeah, you're right.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.602
But this doesn't look surgical.
I'll take it from here.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.821
- Well, you never know.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.562
It could be an obstruction,
gallstones.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.868
I better stay on
just to be safe.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.261
- Um...
- Yeah?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.350
- I really appreciate

03:40.394 --> 03:41.917
everything you're doing
to help,

03:41.960 --> 03:44.528
and I promise as soon
as this becomes surgical,

03:44.572 --> 03:46.313
I will call you, okay?

03:51.535 --> 03:52.754
- Whatever you want.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.538
I'll see you, Carol.

03:54.582 --> 03:55.844
- Thank you.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.454
Bye.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.778
- Hey, Maggie.
- Morning, Sharon.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.867
- How's it going?
- Okay.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.565
[sighs]

04:21.609 --> 04:23.480
She said tomorrow's
Vanessa's last day here.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.960
I didn't handle things right.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.441
- Well, it's not
an easy situation.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.444
- I know, but I'm thinking

04:30.487 --> 04:32.402
maybe if I told her
the truth...

04:32.446 --> 04:35.231
I just don't like leaving
things the way that they are

04:35.275 --> 04:36.798
with the two of us at odds.

04:36.841 --> 04:39.366
- I don't know, Maggie.
Once you take that step...

04:39.409 --> 04:40.932
- I know.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.248
- Morning, Dean.
- Hey.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.078
- So, uh,

04:56.121 --> 04:57.775
I have to ask,

04:57.819 --> 04:59.124
have you sat down
with Dr. Charles yet?

04:59.168 --> 05:01.039
- Mmm.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.912
Actually, he referred me
to a veterans' therapy group.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.217
I went last night.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.307
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.484
It was something, man.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.224
The stories you hear,

05:12.268 --> 05:15.924
the things people
have been through is a--

05:15.967 --> 05:18.274
There's a deep well
of pain out there, man.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.972
- I can imagine.
I bet you had some stories too.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.931
- Ah, well,
nothing worth saying

05:22.974 --> 05:24.933
compared to what
I heard last night.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
And I wanna thank you

05:26.326 --> 05:28.328
for, uh, leaning on me.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.981
Last night was inspiring.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.418
- I'm sorry.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.071
Am I interrupting?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.159
- No, ma'am.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.248
- We have an 18-year-old

05:36.292 --> 05:37.946
in Treatment 6.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.382
And a few weeks ago,

05:39.426 --> 05:43.081
she was diagnosed with
a cranial hemangioblastoma.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.344
- At 18?
That's tough.

05:44.387 --> 05:47.434
- Yeah.
Do you two mind taking a look?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.523
- Of course.
- Thank you.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.441
- Mindy, is this the first time
you've passed out

05:54.484 --> 05:55.877
since your diagnosis?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.139
- I just got dizzy
for a second.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.446
It's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.186
- When they diagnosed her
last month,

06:01.230 --> 06:04.146
they said the tumor was small.
Does this mean it's growing?

06:04.189 --> 06:05.452
- Well, possibly.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.410
Or it could mean
there's a bleed.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.543
Either would be a reason to
recommend surgery to remove it.

06:09.586 --> 06:10.892
- I'm not doing that.

06:10.935 --> 06:11.980
- But sweetie,
if it's getting worse--

06:12.023 --> 06:12.981
- No!

06:13.024 --> 06:14.852
No one's digging
through my brain.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.376
- She's spent the last month
glued to her computer

06:16.419 --> 06:18.465
reading horror stories
about brain surgery.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.249
- They're not just stories,
Dad.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.946
People come out changed.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.385
They stutter, or have seizures,
they forget everybody's names.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.084
I play the piano.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.434
What if I can't
do that anymore?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.044
Uh-uh, no way.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.959
- Okay,
before we go any further,

06:35.003 --> 06:37.353
why don't we get a CT
to see what we're dealing with?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.051
Then we can talk again
and come up with a plan.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.272
- Yeah.
- Uh, we'll be right back.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.404
- Excuse us.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.498
- Her oncologist
wanted to remove the tumor

06:51.541 --> 06:52.934
back when
she was first diagnosed.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.197
- But you can see,
there's no talking to her.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.025
Is there any way that...

06:57.068 --> 06:59.288
- Can we make her do it?

06:59.331 --> 07:02.073
- Uh, I'm sorry, but no.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.292
She's 18 years old.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.033
She has a right
to make her own decisions.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.600
- But she's still a kid.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.211
She doesn't understand
the consequences.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.040
We're at our wit's end.
We don't know what else to do.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.911
- Look, I see how distressing
this is,

07:13.955 --> 07:16.087
and understandably so,

07:16.131 --> 07:18.220
but there is one thing,
as parents, you can do.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.265
- [cries]
Tell us.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.442
- You can apply for temporary
power of attorney.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.009
This will give you the ability
to make medical decisions

07:25.053 --> 07:27.534
should she become unconscious.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.927
- You can do it
with her consent,

07:29.971 --> 07:33.104
but using it to get a procedure
she doesn't want

07:33.148 --> 07:35.542
would be still be circumventing
your daughter's stated wishes.

07:35.585 --> 07:39.067
- With the goal
of saving her life.

07:39.110 --> 07:42.070
- Okay, can we discuss it?
- Of course.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.159
In the meantime,
I'll order a CT.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.171
- [sighs]

07:56.214 --> 07:58.303
Mom's going up
for her echo now.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.088
Are those her labs?

08:00.131 --> 08:01.219
- Yeah.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.483
It is acute liver failure.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.093
- Oh, God.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.095
- And look at this.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.446
- Hepatitis C?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.188
- She must've been carrying it
a long time asymptomatically,

08:13.231 --> 08:15.538
which means something happened

08:15.582 --> 08:17.018
to push her over the edge.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.194
- Do you think
it's a drug interaction?

08:19.237 --> 08:21.544
- I'm not sure
what else it could be.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.112
- Well, we have to take her
off the trial medication.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.461
- That's our only choice.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.419
- Oh, God.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.595
- I know.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.466
I'll put her back
on her old cardiac meds

08:30.510 --> 08:32.468
until we can get her
liver failure under control.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.210
- And then what?
- I'll find something.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.474
- Thanks.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.693
- Yeah.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.478
- I found her
sitting on a bench.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.132
She said that
she wanted to talk to you.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.613
- Wow.
Thanks, Mags.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.005
- Yeah.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.314
- Hi, Dr. Charles.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.663
- Ramona, how you doing?

08:53.707 --> 08:55.230
- Good.
Very good.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.493
- You know,
you gave me a real scare

08:57.537 --> 08:59.582
running out of here
like you did last time.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.324
I'm glad to see you're okay.
- I'm sorry.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.456
There's no reason
for you to worry.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.285
- So, um, what's going on?
What can I do for you?

09:07.329 --> 09:10.158
- Actually I just wanted you
to know that I'm fine.

09:10.201 --> 09:13.596
- Oh, you know, that's great.
And you know what?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.511
I really appreciate
you letting me know, I do.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.819
- Yeah, I just got a new
apartment, and I'm working.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.211
I mean, I'm just temping now,

09:20.255 --> 09:22.126
but I think
they'll keep me on full time.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.173
- Wow, things are, uh,
really looking up.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.478
- They are.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.524
So I thought if you had
a little free time,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.266
maybe we could
get a cup of coffee?

09:31.309 --> 09:34.356
- You know what, I'm in
the middle of my workday.

09:34.399 --> 09:37.359
But I really would like to hear
about what's going on with you.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.840
So, um, so what do you say,
I don't know,

09:39.883 --> 09:41.711
let's make an appointment,
you know, meet in my office

09:41.755 --> 09:43.408
and have a proper chat?

09:44.496 --> 09:46.629
- I just thought
we could hang out.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
- Probably better
that we make an appointment.

09:48.326 --> 09:51.634
I tell you what.
Call me anytime, okay?

09:51.678 --> 09:52.766
I mean it.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.245
If you don't get me,
leave a message.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.638
I'll call you right back, okay?

09:55.682 --> 09:57.379
- Okay.
- Great.

09:57.422 --> 10:00.208
Really good to see you, Ramona.
Really.

10:00.251 --> 10:03.211
- It's good to see you too.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.604
[beeping]

10:04.647 --> 10:06.170
- Dr. Marcel, incoming.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.432
- What do we got?

10:07.476 --> 10:11.088
- 26-year-old male
in respiratory distress,

10:11.132 --> 10:13.700
status-post double lung
transplant eight days ago.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.789
- James.
- You know him?

10:15.832 --> 10:17.486
- Yeah, I was his surgeon.
Hillary, hey.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.618
What happened?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.141
- He started having
trouble breathing

10:20.184 --> 10:21.577
the day after we got home.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.232
His pulmonologist said
to continue taking his meds,

10:24.275 --> 10:27.583
but he just kept getting worse
until today he got a fever.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.454
- Yeah, okay.
All right.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.892
James, we're gonna take
good care of you, bud, okay?

10:31.935 --> 10:35.243
On my count.
One, two, three.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.419
There we go.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.900
James, on a scale of one to
ten, how hard is it to breathe?

10:39.943 --> 10:43.425
- Eight.
Maybe a nine.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.340
- O2 stats 85 on 12 liters,

10:45.383 --> 10:47.559
and he's tachycardic at 106.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.909
- Deep breaths for me, James.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.215
- [labored breaths]

10:51.259 --> 10:53.827
- Yeah, major consolidation
in both the lungs.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.829
Let's order cultures, lytes,
CBC with diff,

10:55.872 --> 10:58.919
cyclosporine level and get him
up for a chest CT, stat.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.617
- Got it.
- Let me see your hands, bud.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.488
- Is he rejecting the lungs?

11:03.532 --> 11:05.621
- No, he's immunosuppressed,
so he shouldn't be,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.710
but he definitely got
a bilateral pneumonia.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.407
The question is why.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.148
James, I want to get you

11:11.192 --> 11:12.454
on a BIPAP machine
to help you breathe.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.760
Is that okay?

11:13.803 --> 11:15.892
Okay, you hang in there
for me, okay?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.894
I'll check back soon,
all right?

11:19.461 --> 11:20.897
[sighs]

11:20.941 --> 11:23.726
- So soon after surgery.
What do you think happened?

11:23.770 --> 11:26.250
- Yeah, I'm not sure yet.
[sighs]

11:26.294 --> 11:29.297
But I do know when it goes
this bad this fast,

11:29.340 --> 11:31.821
surgeon error's always
at the top of the list.

11:39.046 --> 11:39.263
.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.961
- [sighs]

11:41.004 --> 11:43.050
- You find anything yet?

11:43.093 --> 11:44.921
- There's not
a single case of liver failure

11:44.965 --> 11:46.749
in the entire trial.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.751
- Well, if it is
a contra-indication,

11:48.795 --> 11:51.928
then Kender needs to know.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.235
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

11:54.278 --> 11:55.932
I guess I should

11:55.976 --> 11:57.891
go find Dr. Virani.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.328
- Uh...
- I need to let her know.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.764
- No.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.200
She's not in yet.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.811
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.683
- No.
I stole the pills.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.902
I gave them
to my mom illegally.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.818
I need to be the one
to tell her myself.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.776
- Sure.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.779
[dramatic music]

12:16.823 --> 12:19.739
â™ª

12:19.782 --> 12:23.351
- [wheezing]

12:26.876 --> 12:28.791
- How are you, James?
Hillary.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
- Dr. Marcel.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
Have you figured out
what's going on?

12:32.839 --> 12:36.799
- So I've looked all the labs,
the scans,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.322
and the only reason
I can come up with

12:38.366 --> 12:40.150
for getting a pneumonia
this fast

12:40.194 --> 12:41.978
was that something
must have gone wrong

12:42.022 --> 12:44.241
during the transplant surgery.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.853
- Wrong?
What do you mean?

12:46.896 --> 12:49.420
- Well, the lungs
could've mismatched.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.988
A stitch could've come loose.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.468
I'm really not sure.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.209
- So what do we do now?

12:55.252 --> 12:58.342
How do we fix this?

12:58.386 --> 13:00.257
- Honestly,
the options are not good.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.740
As you can see,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.307
the pneumonia has already
caused significant damage

13:06.350 --> 13:07.961
to both lungs.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.006
At this point,
we need to put you on ECMO,

13:10.050 --> 13:12.835
a machine that oxygenates
your blood for you.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.490
- For how long?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.840
- It's hard to say,
but if we end up having

13:17.884 --> 13:20.321
to search
for a new pair of lungs,

13:20.364 --> 13:22.192
it could be
several more months.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.020
- Wait.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.848
Are you saying that

13:25.892 --> 13:28.155
these lungs can't be saved?

13:29.547 --> 13:31.854
- I'm not saying that,

13:31.898 --> 13:33.813
but it is possible.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.860
- [cries]

13:37.904 --> 13:40.297
- I'm so sorry this happened.

13:42.082 --> 13:45.172
Look, I promise you, I'm
gonna do everything that I...

13:46.564 --> 13:49.785
- [crying]

13:51.047 --> 13:53.920
- Uh, I'll give you some space.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.798
[sighs]

14:04.452 --> 14:06.933
- James's new x-ray.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.197
- Lungs are just getting worse.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.461
Damn it.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.071
- When I was in the COVID Ward,

14:15.115 --> 14:17.291
I saw a lot of films
that looked just like that.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.075
Is it possible he's infected?

14:19.119 --> 14:20.555
- No.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.165
The donor was negative.

14:22.209 --> 14:25.603
James tested negative
when he came in today.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.911
- I understand, but maybe
it's worth retesting him.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.871
- No, the truth is,
you were right.

14:33.176 --> 14:37.441
My head has been completely
out of the game lately.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.443
And because of that,

14:39.487 --> 14:41.924
I may have cost this man
his life.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.493
- If there is any donor tissue,

14:45.536 --> 14:47.408
we could check just in case.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.105
- April, I appreciate
everything you're doing.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.324
I do.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.457
Now please, call the ECMO team

14:53.501 --> 14:55.111
and let's get this man
hooked up

14:55.155 --> 14:57.200
before his lungs
completely fail.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.348
- Hey, Emma.
- Hey.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.306
- Can you look up the records
of an organ donor?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.656
I need to know
if there's any lung tissue

15:18.700 --> 15:19.962
you can test for COVID.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.224
- Sure, I'll check for you,
April.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
No.
No lung tissue.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.360
- Okay, thanks.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.189
- But we do have
some deep washings.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.539
- Can you test that?
- Sure.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.107
But I'd need a doctor's order.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.243
[sighs]

15:40.287 --> 15:41.331
[scoffs]

15:41.375 --> 15:43.986
- Here.
- Really, April?

15:44.030 --> 15:46.293
- Come on, you're gonna make me
go back upstairs?

15:46.336 --> 15:47.468
- [sighs]

15:47.511 --> 15:50.906
Okay, "Dr. Marcel."

15:50.950 --> 15:52.690
I'll call you when it's ready.
- Thank you.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.388
- All right.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.392
- Anyway, it's wonderful
that you're doing so well.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.567
Really.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.612
I guess what I'm curious about

16:01.656 --> 16:04.398
is what happened
in the last four weeks?

16:04.441 --> 16:08.184
- Oh, the self-harming,
I mean, the poison.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.664
It all seems
like a bad dream now.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.536
I realize stuff like that
was crazy.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.104
- Wow.
That is great.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.411
That's a huge step, really.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.543
Any insights into why

16:19.587 --> 16:21.937
you were doing that stuff?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.200
- What do you mean?
- Well, as I recall,

16:24.244 --> 16:26.550
we were talking a lot
about your family, right?

16:26.594 --> 16:28.596
And in particular, your dad,

16:28.639 --> 16:31.381
and how you thought
that your relationship changed

16:31.425 --> 16:32.992
as you got older.
- [laughs]

16:33.035 --> 16:35.211
Dr. Charles,
you always come back to that.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.431
My father--I mean, I thought
we were just gonna hang out

16:37.474 --> 16:38.736
and catch up.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.000
- I mean, isn't that
kinda what we're doing?

16:43.524 --> 16:45.308
- Okay.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.050
My father molested me
when I was little a lot,

16:48.094 --> 16:50.052
I wished every day
that it wouldn't happen,

16:50.096 --> 16:53.273
but it would, and there was
nothing I could do about it.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.407
- Ramona, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

16:57.451 --> 17:00.062
- It's okay.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.021
- You know it's not okay.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.198
I mean, I can't imagine

17:05.241 --> 17:07.765
how difficult,
how awful that must've been

17:07.809 --> 17:10.029
for you to go through that.
- It was.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.467
But it's all in the past now.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.514
- You know, in my experience,

17:17.558 --> 17:20.648
recognizing that something
like that happened,

17:20.691 --> 17:22.780
as crucial as it is,

17:22.824 --> 17:24.608
and then processing it

17:24.652 --> 17:27.089
are actually
two different things.

17:27.133 --> 17:31.006
- Okay, well, no.
I have processed it.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.095
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.228
- I completely understand--
- No, okay, see?

17:35.271 --> 17:36.577
We don't need
to talk about this.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.275
You and I can just be friends,
regular friends.

17:39.319 --> 17:42.626
- Ramona, I am absolutely 100%
here for you

17:42.670 --> 17:44.237
as your doctor.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.717
- Okay, stop,
I don't need a psychiatrist.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.111
- Ramona, sit down.
- Why won't you listen to me?

17:49.155 --> 17:51.200
I am fine!
- Ramona.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.032
- Okay.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.555
Yeah.
Bye.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.036
- Maggie, I've got some orders
for treatment two.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.124
- Okay, sure.
- Mm-hmm.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.430
- Oh, wait.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.389
Can we meet up
at the end of the day?

18:06.433 --> 18:08.261
- Did I make a mistake?

18:08.304 --> 18:11.307
- Uh, no, it's just, um,

18:11.351 --> 18:13.353
we use some different
abbreviations here,

18:13.396 --> 18:15.703
and the doctors
are sticklers on it,

18:15.746 --> 18:19.185
so I thought we could just
meet up and go over them.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.143
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.753
- All right.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.060
Yeah.
Right.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.456
- Nat, your mom's EKG.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.460
- [sighs] She developed
a long QT interval?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.418
- Exactly, but there's
an upside to that.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.681
She's now a candidate
for biventricular pacing.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.118
- The cath lab?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.771
But she's still in
acute liver failure.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.774
- Yeah, but it's a heart issue.
Nothing to do with the liver.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.821
- It's a major procedure,
and she's extremely sick.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.605
- Yeah, if we don't
try something,

18:48.649 --> 18:51.521
she could go into a dangerous
arrhythmia at any moment.

18:51.565 --> 18:52.827
- But it's not a cure.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.524
I mean, she still needs
a heart transplant.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.352
- That's right, and this is our
best shot at keeping her alive

18:56.396 --> 18:58.093
until she gets one.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.834
- [sighs]
I don't know, Will.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.315
There's so many
potential complications.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.751
- This is your mom.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.145
I'm not leaving
any stone unturned.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.584
- Okay.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.238
Let's give it a try.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.631
- I'll set it up.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.113
- [sighs]

19:22.944 --> 19:23.118
.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.207
[machinery beeping]

19:25.251 --> 19:29.168
- Lead's in the coronary sinus.
Just putting in the wire.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.344
- These veins
are extremely torturous.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.128
I'm getting
a lot of resistance.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.826
- How about a venography
balloon to anchor you in?

19:35.870 --> 19:37.741
- That'd be great.
Susie?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.134
- I'm on it.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.570
- Carol, how you doing?

19:41.310 --> 19:42.833
- I'm great.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.052
- Good.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.749
Shouldn't be much longer.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.795
We're just grabbing
an extra piece of equipment.

19:47.838 --> 19:51.059
- Okay, well,

19:51.102 --> 19:52.974
just take your...

19:54.323 --> 19:56.630
- Carol?
[machinery beeping quickly]

19:56.673 --> 19:58.719
Her pressure's dropping.
Heart rate's up to 180.

19:58.762 --> 19:59.763
- What's happening?

19:59.807 --> 20:01.243
- She's in SVT.
Bag her.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.592
- Carol?

20:02.636 --> 20:03.767
Carol?

20:03.811 --> 20:04.899
She's unresponsive.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.293
It looks like tamponade.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.077
- The wire must have perforated
her heart.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.905
60cc syringe.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.820
- Mom?
Mom!

20:12.863 --> 20:13.908
- Syringe.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.912
- She's gonna arrest
if you don't get in there now.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.130
- I think I'm in.

20:20.784 --> 20:21.829
No, nothing.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.918
- Angle it deeper.
Charge to 200.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.702
[alarm blaring]

20:25.746 --> 20:27.182
[defibrillator whirs]

20:27.226 --> 20:29.010
- Hold up.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.014
I've got blood.
- [sighs]

20:33.057 --> 20:35.625
- Rhythm's back.
- Heart rate's down.

20:36.757 --> 20:37.801
- Pulse is strong.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.156
- Set up
for continuous drainage.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.862
- Hey.
Vanessa brought her parents in

20:54.905 --> 20:56.777
and wants them
to meet everyone.

20:56.820 --> 20:57.952
- Oh.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.128
- And this is
our charge nurse, Maggie.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.434
She keeps the place running.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.174
Maggie, these are my parents,
Kent and Bea.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.741
- Hi.
- Hello.

21:04.785 --> 21:05.742
- Nice to meet you.

21:05.786 --> 21:08.919
- Your daughter is great.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.312
- She just loves working here.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.314
She can't stop talking
about the patients,

21:12.358 --> 21:13.837
how much she's learning--
- Okay, Mom.

21:13.881 --> 21:14.925
[both laughing]

21:14.969 --> 21:16.231
- What?
You do.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.102
- Ah, parents,
such an embarrassment.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.148
- Ugh, come on, let me show you
where the ambulances come in.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.281
- So nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.288
- Dr. Choi!
Dr. Archer!

21:30.898 --> 21:32.465
- She's not waking up.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.901
- Mindy?
- What's going on?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.119
- The bleeding
must've gotten much worse

21:35.163 --> 21:37.731
faster than we expected.
- What can we do?

21:37.774 --> 21:39.254
- You can use
your power of attorney.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.908
Say the word, and we'll
take her right up to surgery.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.910
- But I'm sure we'd all rather
have Mindy make this decision.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.346
- How?
- We can drill a hole

21:44.390 --> 21:46.000
in her skull right here
to release the pressure.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.349
Then when she wakes up,

21:47.393 --> 21:49.220
we can explain the situation,
get her consent.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.095
Let her make the choice.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.184
- Okay.
- Dr. Choi, a minute, please.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.839
- Nancy, get the drill, high
flow O2, elevate her head.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.320
- We both know
she needs this surgery.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.321
This is our chance.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.714
- Did you do this?
- What?

22:04.758 --> 22:06.325
- Sedate her
to override her wishes?

22:06.368 --> 22:08.805
- I am trying
to save this girl's life.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.285
- I'm about to drill a hole
in her head.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.243
Am I gonna see blood?

22:12.287 --> 22:15.203
- Drill the hole, Doctor.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.422
- Nancy.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.958
Okay.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.396
- Keep her still.
- Yep.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.790
- I can't.
- Ready?

22:36.833 --> 22:37.921
- Yeah.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.796
[drill whirring]

22:42.839 --> 22:44.493
Okay.

22:45.538 --> 22:48.236
- She's waking up.
Mindy, you're okay.

22:48.279 --> 22:51.282
- You want me to set up a drain
for the rest of the blood?

22:51.326 --> 22:53.372
- Yeah.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.072
Hey, Mindy.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.943
Hey, you're okay.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.082
- Ramona,
it's Dr. Charles again.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.258
I don't know if you got
my last message,

23:10.301 --> 23:12.434
but I just think it would be
a really good idea

23:12.478 --> 23:16.177
for us to continue
our conversation.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.006
So I hope you call me back,

23:19.049 --> 23:21.269
at least to let me know
that you're doing okay.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.924
Okay.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.797
[knocking]
- Come in.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.148
- Hey.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.368
- Hello.
[door clicks shut]

23:33.412 --> 23:35.109
- Almost done, huh?

23:35.152 --> 23:36.458
- [sighs]
Yes.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.329
[both laughing]

23:38.373 --> 23:39.548
- Good.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.553
We never ended up
looking at interactions

23:44.597 --> 23:46.468
with Hepatitis C, did we?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.296
- Of course not.

23:48.339 --> 23:51.604
You know we screen
all Hep-positive patients out.

23:51.647 --> 23:52.909
- Right.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.085
Though, if we

23:55.129 --> 23:56.957
knew there was
a definite contraindication

23:57.000 --> 24:00.439
with Hep C, that would
be good to know, right?

24:00.482 --> 24:02.528
- I suppose.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.530
Why are you bringing this up?

24:07.141 --> 24:09.012
- There is a patient

24:09.056 --> 24:12.494
who's on the drug
who was not screened.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.931
- Did they
slip through protocols?

24:14.975 --> 24:17.978
- No, it's not that
she slipped through,

24:18.021 --> 24:19.849
it's that she's not
part of the trial.

24:22.243 --> 24:25.202
- Are you telling me...

24:25.246 --> 24:27.204
our drug went to
an outside patient?

24:28.510 --> 24:31.470
Will, this is a massive
breach of protocol.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.951
Who did this?
- Well, what's important

24:34.995 --> 24:36.866
is that a very sick woman--
- Dr. Halstead,

24:36.910 --> 24:39.478
who gave an unauthorized
patient our trial drug?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.570
- Me.
I did.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.529
- Why--I can't believe you.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.010
You swore you would never
do anything like this again.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.446
- Sabeena, the patient
was out of options--

24:51.490 --> 24:53.492
- Stop making excuses!

24:55.015 --> 24:56.538
I trusted you.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.628
And you betray me like this.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.285
Who is the patient?

25:06.069 --> 25:07.549
- She's Natalie's mother.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.554
- [sighs]

25:12.598 --> 25:14.295
That explains it all,
doesn't it?

25:20.954 --> 25:23.130
You realize
you have quite possibly

25:23.173 --> 25:24.523
compromised the trial...

25:26.263 --> 25:28.483
Not to mention your career.

25:32.269 --> 25:35.142
You can leave.

25:35.185 --> 25:38.101
[heavy music]

25:38.145 --> 25:45.152
â™ª

25:54.770 --> 25:56.511
- [sighs]

25:57.643 --> 25:59.253
- Okay.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.471
Thank you so much.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.563
- Why isn't Mr. Barton on ECMO?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.957
- I ordered a culture
of the lung donor's washings

26:08.001 --> 26:10.046
and told the ECMO tech
to hold off just--

26:10.090 --> 26:11.961
- That man in there is dying,
and every moment counts.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.311
- I know, but I just heard back
from the lab--

26:14.355 --> 26:15.748
- April, for you to ignore me

26:15.791 --> 26:17.227
because of something
you think you saw in an x-ray

26:17.271 --> 26:18.577
is absolutely inexcusable.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.056
- Dr. Marcel, it's positive.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.972
They were traces of COVID DNA
in the lungs.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.374
- [sighs]

26:37.813 --> 26:37.987
.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.599
- I have COVID?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.731
- No, you do not have COVID.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.603
The lungs you were given

26:44.646 --> 26:46.082
had been infected with COVID.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.607
- Even though the donor
tested negative?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.086
- He must've already recovered

26:50.130 --> 26:51.522
but not before the virus

26:51.566 --> 26:54.656
caused widespread microscopic
damage to his lungs.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.485
- None of which was visible
at the time of the transplant.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.793
But it made them
very susceptible to pneumonia.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.708
- So this wasn't
anybody's fault.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.753
Just bad luck.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.973
- It was, but the good news is

27:07.016 --> 27:09.802
Dr. Marcel might be able
to save one of the lungs.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.893
- But this will be
a very risky surgery,

27:13.936 --> 27:16.025
and even then,
I won't know until I'm in there

27:16.069 --> 27:17.723
whether you'll have
enough functional lung

27:17.766 --> 27:19.812
left to survive.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.074
- I could die?

27:21.117 --> 27:24.033
- Yes, you could.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.949
So if you'd rather

27:26.993 --> 27:29.256
me not perform the surgery,

27:29.299 --> 27:31.040
I can get you on ECMO,

27:31.084 --> 27:32.912
and we can start looking
for a new set of lungs.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.000
- [crying]
- Hey, it's okay.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.744
- James...

27:44.619 --> 27:46.012
- I trust you.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.058
- Okay.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.843
Then we're gonna get you
up there right now.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.148
All right?

27:56.587 --> 27:57.806
- Right now the drain

27:57.850 --> 27:59.590
is keeping the pressure
from building up,

27:59.634 --> 28:02.158
but she can only
stay on like this for so long.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.291
- Well, are we talking days,
weeks?

28:04.334 --> 28:05.684
- Depends on several factors,

28:05.727 --> 28:07.337
whether the tumor
continues to grow,

28:07.381 --> 28:09.644
or whether the bleed
breaks through the clot.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.038
- But she will eventually
need the surgery.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.126
- So I--

28:13.169 --> 28:15.606
- Give me a minute with her,
okay?

28:19.393 --> 28:21.003
Hey.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.049
- I don't need another lecture
right now.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.921
I know you think
I'm being stupid.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.706
- Aw, come on.
You kidding me?

28:27.749 --> 28:30.012
Sometimes being scared

28:30.056 --> 28:31.927
is just about the smartest
thing a person can be.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.842
- [scoffs]

28:33.886 --> 28:36.236
- Listen, I was a doctor
in Iraq, all right?

28:36.279 --> 28:38.238
And uh,

28:38.281 --> 28:40.719
we were in a town
that was considered friendly.

28:40.762 --> 28:41.850
All right,
I'm just standing there

28:41.894 --> 28:43.112
in the middle of the street,

28:43.156 --> 28:45.114
and all of a sudden
we start taking fire.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.290
It seemed it was coming
from every direction.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.858
And right off the bat,
I'm hit, all right?

28:49.902 --> 28:53.122
Left thigh, blood pouring
out of everywhere.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.126
And so I hightailed it

28:57.170 --> 28:58.780
to some stairwell.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.955
All right?

28:59.999 --> 29:02.828
It was hidden,
it was relatively quiet,

29:02.871 --> 29:05.221
and all I wanted to do
was just sit there

29:05.265 --> 29:07.049
and wait for the shooting
to stop.

29:09.356 --> 29:12.272
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.361
Tried, couldn't stop it.

29:14.404 --> 29:18.757
After a while,
I start feeling woozy,

29:18.800 --> 29:20.628
started getting cold.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.152
And I knew...

29:25.111 --> 29:28.767
That I was gonna die
right there.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.989
All I could hear on
the other side of that wall

29:34.033 --> 29:36.209
was shooting, right?

29:36.252 --> 29:38.820
So somehow,

29:38.864 --> 29:40.996
I just force myself

29:41.040 --> 29:42.781
to run out of there,

29:42.824 --> 29:44.652
run right through
the middle of that firefight.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.654
I'm running and running and...

29:47.698 --> 29:50.005
Somehow, by some miracle,
I made it.

29:52.181 --> 29:55.402
Leaving that stairwell was the
hardest thing I ever had to do.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.886
But it was what I needed to do

30:00.929 --> 30:02.931
to save my life.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.846
Do you understand?

30:07.153 --> 30:10.765
So as scary as this is...

30:10.809 --> 30:14.464
If I'm there with you the whole
time during this surgery,

30:14.508 --> 30:16.771
will you take that chance too?

30:18.207 --> 30:20.688
- It's really my only chance?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.171
- Yeah, it is.

30:27.347 --> 30:30.350
- [crying]

30:34.049 --> 30:36.008
Okay.
[crying]

30:36.051 --> 30:37.836
- Okay.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.012
Okay.
Okay?

30:42.928 --> 30:44.755
- Looks like you may
have picked the right man

30:44.799 --> 30:47.062
for this job.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.411
- Yeah.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.243
[cell phone buzzing]

30:56.332 --> 30:58.857
- Ramona, I'm so glad
that you--

31:02.251 --> 31:03.862
Okay, Ramona.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.907
Don't do anything.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.866
Don't move.
I'll be right there.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.128
I'm on my way.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.877
Hey, Ramona.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.922
Any way I could get you
to, um,

31:20.966 --> 31:23.882
to step back onto--
onto the balcony

31:23.925 --> 31:26.754
so we could, uh,
so we could chat a bit?

31:29.322 --> 31:30.932
- I keep wondering...

31:32.891 --> 31:35.763
Would it make any difference
if I jumped?

31:35.806 --> 31:37.417
- Oh, it would make
a great difference to me.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.984
- [heavy breathing]

31:39.027 --> 31:40.028
- I can tell you that.

31:40.072 --> 31:43.336
Hey, easy, easy, easy, easy.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.120
Ramona, it's okay.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.907
I just want to talk.

31:48.950 --> 31:52.301
- When I came to see you
this morning, I just--

31:52.345 --> 31:55.304
I just wanted to talk to
someone like a normal person,

31:55.348 --> 31:58.351
just have a conversation.

31:58.394 --> 32:01.136
- Yeah.
Okay.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.573
- I just want a normal life.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.140
[cries]

32:05.184 --> 32:07.360
- Yeah.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.840
You--so, Ramona,

32:09.884 --> 32:11.364
a normal life,

32:11.407 --> 32:13.975
what does that look like
for you?

32:14.019 --> 32:16.282
- It looks like...

32:18.110 --> 32:20.155
Not feeling like a freak.

32:23.028 --> 32:27.510
Like, not being totally alone

32:27.554 --> 32:29.077
all the time.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.253
- Yeah.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.429
- It looks like

32:33.473 --> 32:36.824
having maybe someone...

32:38.304 --> 32:40.567
Who...
- Who you could trust.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.049
- Yeah.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.616
- Somebody who always
had your back,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.010
no matter what.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.925
- Yes.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.406
- Ramona, look at me.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.410
Look at me.

32:59.542 --> 33:02.023
You can trust me.

33:02.067 --> 33:05.287
I absolutely have your back.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.549
And not just me.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.856
There's so much help for you
out there.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.955
- I'm scared.
- Of course you're scared.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.002
I mean, you've been through
something awful.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.655
To really look at that,

33:25.699 --> 33:28.006
I mean, it's gotta be
scary as hell.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.443
But you know what?

33:30.486 --> 33:33.881
I know that you are
brave enough to do that.

33:36.144 --> 33:37.102
- You do?

33:37.145 --> 33:39.887
- I do, and I also know

33:39.930 --> 33:41.932
about a safe place

33:41.976 --> 33:43.978
where that could happen.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.504
- What kind of safe place?

33:48.548 --> 33:50.463
- It's a place
where there are women

33:50.506 --> 33:52.291
who have been through

33:52.334 --> 33:54.032
the same kind of thing
that you have.

33:56.382 --> 33:59.080
What would you
think about maybe

33:59.124 --> 34:01.126
letting me take you there?

34:10.048 --> 34:12.572
I gotcha, I gotcha,

34:14.704 --> 34:16.097
- [crying]

34:16.141 --> 34:17.446
- It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.448
I gotcha.
You're gonna be okay.

34:24.758 --> 34:24.975
.

34:25.019 --> 34:27.891
[machinery beeping]

34:27.935 --> 34:31.852
[dramatic music]

34:31.895 --> 34:34.550
- He opened his eyes.

34:34.594 --> 34:36.639
Does that mean
he's gonna be okay?

34:36.683 --> 34:39.686
- It means he's waking up
from anesthesia.

34:39.729 --> 34:43.124
What matters is if he's able
to follow commands.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.169
- Hey, James.

34:44.212 --> 34:45.822
â™ª

34:45.866 --> 34:47.085
Hey.

34:48.695 --> 34:49.913
Squeeze my hand.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.569
Give it a good squeeze.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.836
Come on.
Give it everything you got.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.143
There it is.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.797
- [crying]

35:03.840 --> 35:06.147
That's good, right?

35:06.191 --> 35:09.019
Oh, my God.
Thank you both so much.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.548
[laughs]

35:18.768 --> 35:20.814
- Hey, April.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.164
Look, I'm sorry about
getting upset before.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.861
I shouldn't have.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.689
You saved his life.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.561
- I'm just glad it worked out.

35:28.604 --> 35:29.953
- Yeah.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.565
Hey, I never asked.
How'd your interview go?

35:32.608 --> 35:33.957
- Oh, my God.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.147
[sighs]

36:04.162 --> 36:05.641
- Hey.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.557
So the pacer's
not gonna be enough.

36:08.601 --> 36:09.863
- [sighs]

36:11.038 --> 36:12.170
Gift of Hope's got her

36:12.213 --> 36:14.563
at the top of
the transplant list, okay?

36:14.607 --> 36:17.958
Hopefully a new heart
will come up soon.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.614
- Oh, um,

36:21.657 --> 36:25.008
you know, I never did get
to talk to Dr. Virani today.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.143
- You know what?

36:29.187 --> 36:30.884
She never came in.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.190
- Oh.

36:32.233 --> 36:35.280
- Yeah, so maybe you can
track her down tomorrow.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.543
- Okay, I just,

36:37.586 --> 36:40.023
I really hope you don't
get into any trouble.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.157
- I wouldn't worry about that.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.247
- Thank you

36:46.291 --> 36:48.684
for everything you did today.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.513
- Sure.

37:01.131 --> 37:02.829
[sighs]

37:08.269 --> 37:09.618
- Yeah.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.535
- She looks good.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.320
- Yeah, I think it's gonna be
a quick recovery.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.104
- Dean, that story in Iraq,

37:17.147 --> 37:19.280
I had no idea you went through
anything like that.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.021
- Yeah, well, didn't we all?

37:21.064 --> 37:23.110
- Not like that.
I didn't.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.547
- Yeah, okay.
[laughs]

37:25.591 --> 37:27.070
- Wait.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.249
That story,
did you make it up?

37:33.033 --> 37:35.122
- No, I did not make it up.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.298
Uh, actually I heard it

37:37.342 --> 37:40.693
from one of the guys
in my vet's group.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.217
I mean, it's not exactly
the same story,

37:43.261 --> 37:44.697
but it's close.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.916
Anyway, that reminds me,
my group's about to start,

37:46.960 --> 37:49.310
so I better get a move on.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.749
- [small laugh]

37:59.189 --> 38:00.974
- I got your page.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.192
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.630
- Hey, uh,

38:04.673 --> 38:07.067
look, Natalie,

38:07.110 --> 38:09.983
if you and Will are getting
back together, just tell me.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.072
This not knowing

38:12.115 --> 38:13.421
is driving me crazy.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.294
- No, Will and I
are not getting back together.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.297
- Okay, then what?

38:20.776 --> 38:22.735
I mean,
you been keeping secrets,

38:22.778 --> 38:25.128
shutting me out.
I mean, something's going on.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.089
- [sighs]

38:31.091 --> 38:33.223
- What?

38:34.224 --> 38:36.879
- I--I stole meds

38:36.923 --> 38:38.316
from Will's trial.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.102
My mom was so sick,

38:42.145 --> 38:43.364
and nothing was working.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.323
I was desperate.
I wanted to tell you,

38:45.366 --> 38:49.283
but I felt so guilty
and so afraid.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.373
And now my mom
is dying in there,

38:52.417 --> 38:54.114
and she needs a new heart,

38:54.157 --> 38:56.725
and I don't know what to do.
[crying]

38:56.769 --> 38:59.162
- Oh, honey, come here.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.253
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39:04.864 --> 39:06.300
It's okay, Nat.
It's okay.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.998
Okay.
It's okay.

39:09.042 --> 39:10.652
- Okay.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.959
Yeah.
Here you go.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.961
Thank you.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.137
- Hey, you wanted to talk to me
about abbreviations?

39:17.180 --> 39:19.052
- I'll call you right back.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.401
Yes.

39:20.445 --> 39:21.924
I wrote them down for you.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.665
- Cool.

39:25.754 --> 39:28.931
- Your parents, they seem like
really nice people.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.672
- Yeah, they're great.

39:30.716 --> 39:31.978
You know, parents.
[laughs]

39:32.021 --> 39:34.676
- Sure.
- Yes, I get this.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.158
Anything else, Maggie?

39:38.201 --> 39:40.203
- No.
That's it.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.076
- Okay.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.686
Yeah, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.035
- See you tomorrow.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.049
- It looks nice.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.053
- I think you're gonna find
it's a pretty special place.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.143
- Hey, Daniel.

40:09.929 --> 40:13.280
- Ramona, this is Dr. Garner.

40:13.323 --> 40:15.413
- Oh, please.
Call me Anne.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.981
It's nice to meet you, Ramona.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.896
Your room is ready.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.465
And there's breakfast in
the kitchen if you're hungry.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.908
So would you

40:32.952 --> 40:34.736
like to come in
and meet everyone?

40:39.088 --> 40:41.439
- Mm-hmm.
