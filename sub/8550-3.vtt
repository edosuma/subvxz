SORRY TO
STARTLE YOU, MA'AM.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.490
I'M LOOKING
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.097
THAT'S
A GOOD ONE, SIR,

00:29.163 --> 00:31.432
BUT I'M JUST HELPING OUT
AROUND THE HOUSE.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.468
WE'RE A MODERN FAMILY.

THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.991

WHEN THERE'S
POLICE BUSINESS TO

GETTING BEEPERS?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.138
NO, JUST YOU.

ALL MY OTHER SERGEANTS
HAVE ALREADY HAD

01:12.039 --> 01:14.308
THEIR ANNUAL
PERFORMANCE REVIEW.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.745

I'D LIKE
BACON AND EGGS.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.109
PANCAKES.
WAFFLES.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.312
I'LL TAKE ICE CREAM!

03:32.946 --> 03:34.114
YOU'RE
GETTING OATMEAL.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.449
OH, MAN.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.985
[BEEPER BEEPS]

03:38.051 --> 03:38.986
UH-OH, UH-OH.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
THAT'S
LIEUTENANT MURTAUGH.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.491
THIS COULD BE AN EMERGENCY,
AND I'M NOT DRESSED YET.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.560
CARL HASN'T
MOVED THAT FAST

03:46.627 --> 03:49.229
SINCE HE CHASED
A DOUGHNUT DOWNHILL.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.268
BUT SOFT!

03:59.807 --> 04:02.276
WHAT LIGHT THROUGH
YONDER WINDOW BREAKS?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.816
IT IS THE EAST,
AND LAURA IS THE SUN.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.154
HEY, THAT'S
FROM ROMEO AND JULIET.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.989
VERY GOOD.
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:16.056 --> 04:19.327
THE AUDITIONS FOR
THE ANNUAL SCHOOL PLAY
ARE BEING HELD TODAY.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.363
THIS YEAR'S
OFFERING IS
THE BARD'S TRAGEDY

04:22.430 --> 04:25.299
OF TWO
STAR-CROSSED LOVERS.

04:25.366 --> 04:29.503
DOES THAT GIVE YOU
THE SHIVERS, MY SWEET?

04:29.570 --> 04:32.806
WELL, MY SKIN IS
DEFINITELY CRAWLING.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.610
STEVE, WHY DON'T YOU
TRY OUT FOR ROMEO?

04:36.677 --> 04:39.680
THAT WOULD MAKE IT
A COMEDY.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.417
THOSE WERE
THE EXACT WORDS

04:43.484 --> 04:45.753
UTTERED BY MS. STEUBEN,
THE PLAY'S DIRECTOR.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.589
BUT, OF COURSE, SHE WAS
BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THAT MY

04:48.656 --> 04:52.593
DASHING GOOD LOOKS AND
REMARKABLE PHYSICAL PROWESS

04:52.660 --> 04:56.096
WOULD CLEARLY OVERSHADOW
THE REST OF THE CAST.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.165
SO SHE MADE YOU
STAGE MANAGER?

04:58.231 --> 04:59.567
YEAH.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.704
GOODNIGHT.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.172
GOODNIGHT.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.140
PARTING IS
SUCH SWEET SORROW,

05:07.207 --> 05:08.909
THAT I SHALL
SAY GOODNIGHT

05:08.976 --> 05:10.444
TILL IT BE MORROW.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.185
HEH HEH.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.587
[SNORTS]

05:24.825 --> 05:28.762
SO, LAURA, ARE YOU
GOING TO AUDITION
FOR JULIET?

05:28.829 --> 05:29.697
I'M NOT SURE.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.699
YOU SHOULD.
YOU'D BE GREAT.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.033
ABSOLUTELY.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.103
YOU ARE RELATED TO ME,
AND I AM A WONDERFUL ACTRESS.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.374
THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE SEEN HER
TELL A MAN SHE WAS 23
AND NOT EVEN BLINK.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.247
WELL, GOT TO GO.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.216
WHAT WAS THE EMERGENCY, CARL?

05:49.282 --> 05:51.018
OH, UH...

05:51.084 --> 05:52.586
LIEUTENANT MURTAUGH...

05:52.653 --> 05:54.955
WANTS ME TO PICK UP HIS

05:55.022 --> 05:56.557
UNIFORM
AT THE CLEANERS.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.494
WATCH THIS PERFORMANCE.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.131
OH, CARL!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.500
DON'T GO OUT THERE
ALL ALONE.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.902
WE'RE CRAZY ABOUT YOU,
YOU BIG LUG.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.507
WHEN WILL IT ALL END--
THE ROBBING, THE KILLING,

06:13.574 --> 06:15.175
THE UNIFORM
PICKING-UPPING?

06:15.242 --> 06:16.610
[GASPS]

06:16.677 --> 06:19.613
OH, I JUST CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.018
I STILL GOT IT.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.789
YEAH,
BUT WHO WANTS IT?

06:35.362 --> 06:38.432
ROMEO! ROMEO!

06:38.499 --> 06:40.601
WHEREFORE ART THOU ROMEO?

06:41.869 --> 06:45.138
DENY THY FATHER
AND REFUSE THY NAME

06:45.205 --> 06:48.609
OH, ROMEO!

06:48.676 --> 06:50.911
OH, THANK YOU. UH..

06:52.412 --> 06:53.514
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.549
THANK YOU,
EVERYONE!

06:57.685 --> 06:59.753

VERY GOOD.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.622
YOU WERE ALL
VERY GOOD.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.923
STOP THAT.
STOP THAT.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.191
NOW!

07:13.634 --> 07:15.803
LOOK, STEVEN...

07:15.869 --> 07:17.204
TAKE A SEAT.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.772
WHERE?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.440
PITTSBURGH.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.044
OH, MS. STEUBEN,
YOU SLAY ME.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.447
OH, OH.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.418
AHEM.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.353
AS I WAS SAYING...

07:33.420 --> 07:35.956
THE AUDITIONS
WERE SPIRITED,

07:36.023 --> 07:38.091
BUT THE PART OF ROMEO

07:38.158 --> 07:41.461
WILL BE PLAYED BY
DANIEL WALLACE.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.900
I KNEW
HE'D GET IT.
HE'S GORGEOUS.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.204
GIRL, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE HIM IN TIGHTS.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.641
NOW, I HAVE NARROWED
THE CHOICES FOR JULIET

07:53.707 --> 07:55.543
DOWN TO TWO GIRLS.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.746
IT WILL EITHER BE
MAXINE OR LAURA.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.485
DANIEL, WOULD YOU MIND
READING WITH THE LADIES?

08:05.553 --> 08:08.321
WELL, IT WILL BE
MY EXTREME

08:08.388 --> 08:10.223
AND INTENSE
PLEASURE.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.092
MAXINE, YOU GO FIRST.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.065
BUT SOFT!

08:18.131 --> 08:20.668
WHAT LIGHT THROUGH
YONDER WINDOW BREAKS?

08:20.734 --> 08:23.003
IT IS THE EAST...

08:23.070 --> 08:25.138
AND JULIET IS THE SUN.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.376
SEE HOW SHE LEANS
HER CHEEK UPON HER HAND.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.745
OH, THAT I WERE
A GLOVE UPON THAT HAND,

08:31.812 --> 08:33.914
THAT I MIGHT
TOUCH THAT CHEEK.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.986
YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS.

08:39.052 --> 08:39.820
UH...

08:39.887 --> 08:42.089
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MAXINE.

08:42.155 --> 08:45.759
THAT WAS A VERY
INTERESTING INTERPRETATION.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.129
HOW'D I DO?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.831
OH--OH,
YOU WERE GREAT.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.232
LAURA,
IT'S YOUR TURN.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.669
LET'S START WITH
LINE 31, ACT II, SCENE 2.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.412
DOST THOU LOVE ME?

09:05.478 --> 09:08.616
OH, GENTLE ROMEO,
IF THOU DOST LOVE,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.851
PRONOUNCE IT FAITHFULLY.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.686
OH, THERE'S
OUR JULIET.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.221
OH, YEAH.

SUCH SWEET SORROW...

09:26.499 --> 09:30.203
THAT I SHALL
SAY GOODNIGHT...

09:30.270 --> 09:32.005
TILL IT BE MORROW.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.209
CUT! CUT!

09:40.580 --> 09:43.617
I SAID CUT,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.365
OOH, HARRIETTE.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.101
SWEETHEART,
YOU LOOK...

10:01.168 --> 10:02.970
FINE.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.108
THANK YOU, CARL.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.443
IN FACT...
WHY DON'T YOU AND I

10:10.510 --> 10:13.714
JUST SKIP DINNER
AND STAY HOME?

10:13.781 --> 10:16.149
WE COULD DO THAT.
YEAH?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.451
BUT IF WE DO...

10:18.518 --> 10:21.388
WE'LL MISS THE
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT SPECIAL

10:21.454 --> 10:23.623
AT CHEZ JOSEPHINE'S.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.733
LET'S GO.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.202
[BEEPER BEEPS]

10:35.268 --> 10:37.170
NO, NOT MURTAUGH AGAIN.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.740
SWEETHEART,
I KNOW IT'S A PAIN,

10:39.807 --> 10:43.711
BUT IT'S MY ANNUAL REVIEW TIME,
AND I GOTTA BE
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

10:43.777 --> 10:47.781
BUT, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL JUST TELL MURTAUGH
WE HAVE SPECIAL PLANS.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.019
NOW ALWAYS
REMEMBER, LAURA,

10:52.085 --> 10:55.255
THAT GREAT ACTING
COMES FROM WITHIN.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.891
LEGENDARY PERFORMANCES
COME FROM ACTORS

10:57.958 --> 11:01.328
WHO CAN REACH DEEP DOWN
INTO THEIR SOULS

11:01.394 --> 11:03.196
AND DREDGE UP PAIN.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.234
CAN YOU FEEL IT, LAURA?
CAN YOU FEEL A PAIN?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.505
I FEEL A PAIN,
AUNT RACHEL,

11:12.572 --> 11:15.342
AND I'M HOPING IT WILL
GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.013
DID YOU HEAR WHAT
YOUR DAUGHTER SAID TO ME?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.149
CARL'S TELLING MURTAUGH
WE'RE BUSY TONIGHT,

11:22.215 --> 11:24.818
AND HE'S UNAVAILABLE
TO RUN HIS PERSONAL ERRANDS.

11:24.885 --> 11:29.589
YES, SIR.
THAT'S TWO BURGERS
WELL-DONE...

11:29.656 --> 11:31.825
A SMALL ORDER OF FRIES,

11:31.892 --> 11:34.594
AND ONE VANILLA SHAKE.
YES, SIR.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.463
GOT IT, SIR.
NO PROBLEM.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.066
GLAD TO DO IT, SIR.
BYE, NOW.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
HARRIETTE,
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK,

11:46.173 --> 11:48.341
BUT THE POOR GUY'S CAR
IS IN THE SHOP,

11:48.408 --> 11:51.311
AND HE'S ON HIS STOMACH
WITH A PAINFUL BOIL.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.817
CARL, I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS.

11:56.884 --> 12:00.620
I RUSH HOME FROM WORK,
TAKE TWO HOURS
TO GET READY,

12:00.687 --> 12:04.825
AND NOW I'M STAYING HOME
BECAUSE YOUR BOSS
HAS A BOIL.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.029
YOU SEE, LAURA,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.698
THAT'S THE KIND OF PAIN
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.302
IF YOU COULD REACH
DEEP INTO YOUR SOUL--

12:20.573 --> 12:24.912
WELL, I BETTER GO GET
LIEUTENANT MURTAUGH'S
FOOD AND OINTMENT.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.881
YOU KNOW,

12:27.948 --> 12:30.750
I DON'T THINK THIS
NIGHT CAN GET ANY WORSE.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.822
HI-DEE-HO, WINSLOWS!

12:37.190 --> 12:38.959
I WAS WRONG.
