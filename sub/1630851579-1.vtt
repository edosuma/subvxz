01:14.658 --> 01:16.774
Hello, I'm Mr. conductor,

01:16.785 --> 01:19.652
and I'm going to tell
you a story about trains,

01:19.663 --> 01:22.154
folks far apart and the magic railroad

01:22.165 --> 01:23.450
that brought them together.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.084
Every story, like a
railroad, has its heroes.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.468
Meet Thomas, he's our number one hero.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.460
Hello!

01:37.472 --> 01:39.804
But he's
running a little late today.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.515
This is the island of sodor

01:42.519 --> 01:44.384
where Thomas and his friends live.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.058
It's at one end of my special universe.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.771
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hello, James.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.569
I like helping out here.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.114
By the invitation of sir
topham hatt, of course.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.210
Five, six, seven, eight.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.793
Who do we appreciate?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.755
Practicing your numbers,
Gordon. That's a good engine.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.341
I'm counting how
many seconds late you are.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.294
What does that sign say?

02:18.305 --> 02:20.466
Hmm "sodor railway.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.966
"Really reliable and right on time."

02:24.811 --> 02:28.053
Signed, "head of the
railway, sir topham hatt."

02:28.065 --> 02:30.647
But you weren't
on time, little Thomas.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.108
And you're being bossy, Gordon.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.853
Please excuse me. I'm
meeting Mr. conductor.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.566
Takes a much needed holiday.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.442
I think
we can take care of ourselves.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.742
Get out of my way!

02:45.749 --> 02:47.785
T have unfinished business here

02:47.793 --> 02:50.876
and I wanna finish it fast!

02:50.879 --> 02:52.915
Diesel 10's back!

02:52.923 --> 02:55.255
Yes, 10 out of 10

02:55.258 --> 02:58.842
for devious deeds and brutal strength.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.508
The blast from the past
who hates steam engines.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.600
Maybe we do need
Mr. conductor here after all.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.638
On time!

03:11.900 --> 03:14.357
At the other end of my universe,

03:14.361 --> 03:16.773
far away across oceans of time,

03:17.948 --> 03:21.315
up and over muffle mountain
and hidden deep in a valley,

03:21.326 --> 03:22.486
is my hometown,

03:23.537 --> 03:24.572
shining time.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.040
J every now and then

03:30.043 --> 03:34.332
j there appears a sign j

03:34.339 --> 03:37.547
j that points just round the bend

03:37.551 --> 03:41.590
j to a place you'll find 7

03:41.596 --> 03:45.088
j covered in clover j

03:45.100 --> 03:48.433
j the magic comes over you j

03:48.437 --> 03:53.352
j showing up right on time j

03:54.109 --> 03:59.069
j this is your shining time j

04:00.532 --> 04:03.695
j climbing through stars to

04:03.702 --> 04:07.615
j your own cloud nine j

04:07.622 --> 04:10.910
j soft strokes of lightning j

04:10.917 --> 04:14.830
j paint the skies brightening j

04:14.838 --> 04:18.456
j up all your shining time j

04:21.803 --> 04:24.545
and by the way, I think you're
going to help me and Thomas

04:24.556 --> 04:26.547
somewhere in this story.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.138
If diesel
has unfinished business,

04:30.145 --> 04:32.682
there's sure to be trouble
right around the corner.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.812
Sandal, fly! Boo,
fly! Shoo, fly! That's it!

04:43.784 --> 04:45.149
Better still, buzz off.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.777
Botheration!

04:48.789 --> 04:51.246
You weren't
concentrating, Thomas.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.036
Lucky for you that the buffers were there.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.534
That's what buffers are for,

04:55.545 --> 04:57.501
to stop engines from crashing.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.246
Why are you in the sheds, James?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.543
I'm feeling a little blue.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.918
Which isn't so hot when you're red.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.466
I was naughty and sir topham hatt

05:06.473 --> 05:10.057
told me to think about all the
ways I can be really useful.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.971
Then I can come out again.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.093
He's just trying to make this

05:13.104 --> 05:14.719
a better railway for steam engines.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.438
He says, the harder we work,

05:17.442 --> 05:18.932
the less he'll need diesels to help.

05:18.944 --> 05:19.944
Help you?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.938
You'll always need help!

05:24.950 --> 05:29.068
Because steam engines
are cowardly, cranky,

05:29.079 --> 05:33.698
worn out hunks of metal
who couldn't hurt a fly.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.834
- No, we're not!
- Yes, you are!

05:37.838 --> 05:40.045
Aren't! = arel

05:40.048 --> 05:44.166
now, I've come back to
find a lost steam engine.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.166
What?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.385
I'm gonna destroy
her and dominate you!

05:47.389 --> 05:52.383
And then you'll be nothing but
useless scrap! Right, pinchy?

05:52.394 --> 05:54.430
Big bully! Stinker!

05:54.437 --> 05:56.052
We're really useful engines!

05:56.064 --> 05:59.306
You won't dominate us and
you won't destroy her!

05:59.317 --> 06:01.683
We won't let you. Neither
will Mr. conductor.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.061
I'm off to fetch him now.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.312
What lost engine?

06:10.620 --> 06:13.032
There, mutt, the paint job's finished.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.325
I reckon shining time
has the best welcome sign

06:15.333 --> 06:16.698
of any town in our valley.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.038
I'm glad you agree.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.002
Billy's old map sure helped a lot.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.169
He's on his way back now, is he?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.792
You hear that train whistle
sooner than it hears itself.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.122
Fine work, patch.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.126
= thanks.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.994
Oh, I've been looking at your map.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.713
What are these mysterious shadowy lines?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.423
They look like straight railroad tracks,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.964
but I can't see any tracks around here,

07:09.971 --> 07:11.757
except the ones you travel on.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.724
It's mysteries that make this land so...

07:15.727 --> 07:16.727
Magical?

07:18.063 --> 07:19.769
T better be off to muffle mountain.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.435
I promised Mr. stone that
I'd clean his yard today.

07:23.526 --> 07:27.986
Does Burnett stone
ever give you a smile?

07:27.989 --> 07:30.446
No, but he doesn't
frighten my horse, either.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.242
Which means, I don't think he's a bad man.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.735
I think he's just sad.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.664
I didn't
know that in muffle mountain

07:39.668 --> 07:42.125
there was a secret that Burnett had shared

07:42.128 --> 07:44.744
only with his childhood friend, Tasha.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.376
One day, Tasha,

07:47.384 --> 07:48.965
I'm going to drive this engine.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.130
And I'll take you with me.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.048
Promise
you will, Burnett. Promise!

07:53.056 --> 07:55.342
I promise.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.591
This
engine was vital to the magic

07:58.603 --> 08:01.766
that held these worlds together,
but only Burnett knew that.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.401
Hello. Shining time station.
Manager Stacy Jones speaking.

08:16.287 --> 08:20.200
Oh, yes, the 10:15 from
pelican falls to shining time

08:20.208 --> 08:21.493
is right on schedule.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.876
You're welcome.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.495
The 10:00 to Lucy's leap is leaving now.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.591
Oh, Billy, I found this child's drawing

08:31.594 --> 08:33.630
in an old locker in the lost and found.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.926
Look at the signature, Billy.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.515
Burnett stone!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.009
It's hard to believe Burnett

08:41.021 --> 08:43.012
could have ever looked that happy.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.765
= Burnett had a wonderful smile.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.725
And he loved railroading, too.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.665
How did you find me here?

09:07.672 --> 09:10.334
I found the entrance to
your workshop ages ago.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.206
But I would never tell anybody.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.754
See that switch on the wall?

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
Flip it on.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.602
I guessed there
was something mysterious

09:27.609 --> 09:29.224
about this mountain.

09:29.235 --> 09:33.945
Yeah. All mountains
have their secrets, patch.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.779
Shouldn't surprise a kid like you.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.280
Could I help you, Mr. stone?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.246
Sure. You can help me dust her off.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.996
This engine's name is lady.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.162
Why is she locked up?

09:51.174 --> 09:54.541
= she isn't. She's safe from harm.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.886
Long ago, I made a mistake
as lady's caretaker.

09:58.890 --> 10:03.850
An evil diesel found lady and
threatened to destroy her.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.350
He chased her and used up all her coal.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.852
He made her go too fast

10:10.860 --> 10:12.816
and then he crashed hevr.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.649
Then I brought her here.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.815
I tried my best to fix her up

10:20.537 --> 10:23.700
but I've never been able to
make up for the mistake I made.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.745
And I've never been able to

10:29.546 --> 10:30.546
bring her to life.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.673
To make her steam.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.919
Patch, she's as precious as gold.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.010
Pinchy, you
captured the real me.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.633
That's beautiful. I could cry.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.510
- Boss?
- We're here.

10:47.522 --> 10:51.310
Listen, you two.
I've got a job for you, splodge.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.935
- Actually, it's splatter.
- And dodge.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.437
I ain't got
time to say both names!

10:57.448 --> 10:58.278
Oh, well.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.148
I've come back to find a steam engine.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.697
- That's easy.
- Yeah, they're everywhere.

11:02.704 --> 11:06.663
Not the one I want.
She escaped me once before.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.282
As long as she exists, so do the others.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.955
But if she can be destroyed.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.001
Destroyed? The "d" word?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.462
Did you say the destroyed?

11:14.465 --> 11:16.046
Yeah, destroyed!

11:16.050 --> 11:17.506
There's one problem.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.966
Mr. conductor's coming,

11:18.970 --> 11:20.335
and he won't let you destroy.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.587
I can do whatever I want!

11:22.599 --> 11:25.341
I'll get him, too! With pinchy!

11:26.603 --> 11:29.470
Ow! Pinchy, I hate it when you do that!

11:38.281 --> 11:41.068
- Hello, Mr. conductor.
- Hello, Billy.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.218
Tool kit? Check.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.758
Ticket puncher?

12:03.765 --> 12:04.765
Check-check.

12:08.019 --> 12:08.849
All aboard!

12:08.853 --> 12:10.093
Just testing, Billy.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.937
Mustn't let my conducting
skills get rusty.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.477
Important day, Mr. c?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.982
It is a very important day!

12:19.989 --> 12:22.275
I'm going to the island of sodor.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.366
It's the only place in my
universe where I fit in size-wise.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.112
Sir topham hatt has given
me a big responsibility.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.487
Diesel 10 is back

12:29.499 --> 12:31.455
and I have to make sure
he behaves himself.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.544
Excuse me, Billy.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.455
I hope your visit goes well, Mr. c.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.466
Thank you.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.798
I must be responsible, reliable and...

12:45.807 --> 12:46.807
Don't tell me.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.262
Really useful. I knew that.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.184
I'm sorry. What did you say?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.987
Well, thank you, Moby dick.
I like my sparkle, too.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.822
You know, gold really is your color.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.124
Stacy, where did you find this painting?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.709
= in an old locker.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.546
It was done by Burnett
stone when he was a child.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.716
I was told that he used
to work on this railroad.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.383
But he never leaves the other
side of the mountain now.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.598
You seem puzzled, Mr. conductor.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.387
Well, I am puzzled.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.636
This place looks like the island of sodor

13:34.647 --> 13:37.935
but how would Burnett stone
travel there without gold dust?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.648
Sparkle's been the only
way to make the trip

13:39.652 --> 13:41.608
since the lost engine disappeared.

13:41.612 --> 13:44.570
Anyway, I just came to say
goodbye. I have to go now.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.443
Right now?

13:46.451 --> 13:49.318
Why yes Stacy. I have to make sure
everything's safe and sound

13:49.329 --> 13:51.695
on the island of sodor
just as I try to do here.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.209
Like Stacy, mutt sensed danger,

13:59.213 --> 14:01.955
he didn't want either Billy
or me to leave shining time.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.715
Old smoky, you stay right
here until I get back.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.560
Ah, there you are.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.848
Is something wrong here?

14:21.152 --> 14:23.143
What kind of answer is that?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.194
Ar!

14:25.198 --> 14:28.406
I'm going to be late. I'll
get back as fast as I can.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.525
I have to concentrate now, mutt.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.027
I'm suddenly having
problems with my sparkle.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.208
Mutt?

14:41.005 --> 14:43.496
Goodbye, mutt.

14:43.508 --> 14:47.342
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.722
Mr. conductor, where are you?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.515
I know you live far away,

14:58.523 --> 15:00.479
but you always seem to get here on time.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.943
Oh, Mr. conductor! Are you all right?

15:05.947 --> 15:08.814
Yes, Thomas. But sometimes
everything happens at once.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.409
I have to see sir topham hatt
to get my orders right away.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.868
The journey from shining time

15:13.871 --> 15:15.736
keeps getting bumpier and bumpier.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.581
Does it?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.416
A big bully diesel is back.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.537
You had better be careful.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.664
Sir topham hatt warned me about diesel.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.085
Don't worry, Thomas.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.835
I'll just pop in and out with
my sparkle wherever he goes

15:29.846 --> 15:31.131
and keep him in order.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.139
I hope.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.929
J old macdiesel had a plan
hee, hee, hee, hee, hee j

15:36.936 --> 15:39.052
j a pinch-pinch here,
and a pinch-pinch there

15:39.063 --> 15:40.223
j here a pinch, there a pinch j

15:40.231 --> 15:42.347
I crack myself up.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.229
Tasha, the conductor family

15:45.236 --> 15:47.852
has a little steam engine,
with her own railroad,

15:47.864 --> 15:50.446
and has wonderful energy because of it.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.032
But a diesel wants to destroy her.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.402
And without her, the conductor's
universe will vanish.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.154
The man with the sparkle
told me that one day,

15:58.166 --> 15:59.997
one of his family will return,

16:00.001 --> 16:02.993
but until then, "to guard
her well, young Burnett.”

16:03.880 --> 16:05.620
But I didn't guard you well.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.970
Seem to understand about...

16:17.226 --> 16:18.226
About magic anymore.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.804
This is
where Burnett's granddaughter,

16:22.815 --> 16:25.022
Lily, comes into our story.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.733
She lives with her mom
and dad in the big city,

16:27.737 --> 16:30.023
a few hours train ride from shining time.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.693
She sees magic no one else has time to,

16:32.700 --> 16:35.407
like lovely reflections
of light on a rainy day.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.696
Soon, she was off to stay with her grandpa

16:39.707 --> 16:41.993
on muffle mountain,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.538
grandpa's been so sad
since grandma Tasha died

16:44.545 --> 16:47.252
and he never comes here to see us.

16:47.256 --> 16:51.215
Well, maybe your visit
will cheer him up. Hmm?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.005
Did you get his present?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.754
Here. I'm making him
a friendship bracelet.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.506
Honey, that's beautiful.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.093
But I'd rather just stay here with you.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.221
= t know. Come here.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.610
- I'm gonna go up this way.
- Okay.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.855
Be careful. You always say that.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.653
See you in a minute.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.369
You're coming with me
to grandpa's, bluebird.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.087
I know how much you like to travel.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.262
Far away on sodor,

17:42.270 --> 17:44.886
the steam engines were
confident, cheerful,

17:44.897 --> 17:47.604
and determined not to
be bullied by diesel.

17:51.362 --> 17:55.696
Only James, who now felt really
useful too, was complaining.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.533
- Wobbly wheels.
- Puffy pistons.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.278
Thomas, I should
have collected Mr. conductor!

18:01.289 --> 18:03.996
James is right, little Thomas.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.958
Collecting Mr. conductor
is an important job.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.293
Important is big.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.162
James is a big engine.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.380
You, Thomas, are small!

18:13.384 --> 18:15.295
Small, small, small.
Teeny, weenie, weenie.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.716
And I am a big, blue engine who
knows everything.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.259
Bossy sprockets!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.257
All that steam has gone to your funnel!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.925
- There they are.
- We'll fix their wagons.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.097
- I'm no good at backing up.
- Me neither.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.845
What's important is to stand up

18:27.857 --> 18:29.643
oh our own wheels to diesel.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.266
Tobys's right. Diesel
knows that the lost engine

18:34.280 --> 18:36.441
- what engine?
- What legend?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.111
An engine whose
magic makes her more powerful

18:39.118 --> 18:40.824
than diesel will ever be.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.693
That's why he wants to find her.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.661
Then we'd better find her first.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.122
Leave it to
the big engines, Percy.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.492
Little engines
can do big things.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.461
Especially when they have
nice blue paint like me.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.205
Hey, just watch what happens

18:54.216 --> 18:55.331
to that blue puffball.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.925
When Harold the
flopper chopper flies past here.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.838
Right!

18:58.846 --> 19:01.633
Routine fly-by, chaps. Hello.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.303
The boss dumped
sneezing powder everywhere.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.473
Let's start laughing now.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.890
Oh, sorry, fellas.

19:08.898 --> 19:09.887
A bit of a dust up.

19:09.899 --> 19:10.729
Love to stay and clean up.

19:10.733 --> 19:11.733
Got to go. Bye.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.107
- No.
- Neither did 1.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.197
This must be
diesel's doing! Toot!

19:21.410 --> 19:22.650
"Dear, Mr. conductor.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.198
"Where were you?

19:26.374 --> 19:30.208
"My wife said she couldn't
miss our little holiday.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.829
"We'll telephone to make
sure you have arrived."

19:33.839 --> 19:36.330
Signed, "sir topham hatt."

19:46.477 --> 19:47.762
Sir topham hatt.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.329
Where were you?

20:23.889 --> 20:26.130
Oh, good afternoon, sir.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.718
A real honor, sir.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.345
Like my family before me.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.849
And how is lady hatt?

20:36.861 --> 20:40.774
Yes. Watch out for diesel. Definitely.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.942
Keep an eye on Henry's health. Certainly.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.033
Yes, sir, the three r's,
reading, writing and arithmetic.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.036
Ti mean...

20:48.414 --> 20:50.245
I will be responsible,

20:50.249 --> 20:51.249
reliable

20:51.959 --> 20:53.620
and really useful.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.037
Yes, sir.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.536
We will all get a good night's sleep.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.789
Looking forward to a hard day tomorrow.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.386
Goodbye, sir.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.345
So, who dropped the ball then?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.598
Oh, there you are.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.184
I'd like a nice cup of hot cocoa.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.395
Would you fellas care to join me?

21:56.398 --> 21:57.854
No? What would you rather do instead?

21:57.858 --> 22:01.225
Go outside and play? Well,
I can understand that.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.320
What do you think? Why do you
keep hitting him like that?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.883
You're going to have
to have a time out.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.451
Just a little sweeter, I think.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.841
All right, pinchy,
my little bucket of badness,

22:25.845 --> 22:27.176
time to feast yourself.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.555
Ah! Now that's better.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.694
Cinders and ashes, it's diesel!

22:49.702 --> 22:50.987
Diesel? Oh, no!

22:56.584 --> 22:58.370
Hello, twinkle toes!

22:59.461 --> 23:02.043
I've got a plan and you're not in it!

23:02.047 --> 23:06.381
You can't catch me, diesel!

23:09.930 --> 23:13.218
Losing your sparkle,
huh? What perfect timing.

23:14.435 --> 23:17.393
Where is that lost engine?
= you won't find her here.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.933
You're not
clever enough to stop me.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.680
Oh, yes, I am!

23:21.692 --> 23:24.434
No, you're not. Is that...

23:24.445 --> 23:26.276
That's right. It's sugar, diesel.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.611
And if I throw this in your tank,

23:27.615 --> 23:29.151
it'll seize you up for good.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.275
Make the most
of tonight, twinkle toes,

23:33.287 --> 23:35.573
because you won't like tomorrow!

23:36.916 --> 23:39.874
Neither will that line of tin kettles!

23:42.963 --> 23:44.078
Shut up, pinchy.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.011
Mr. conductor, but
what happened to your sparkle?

23:53.474 --> 23:56.716
I don't know, Thomas. I'll
just have to sleep on that.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.763
On your sparkle?

23:58.771 --> 23:59.771
No, Thomas.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.098
On the problem of what happened to it.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.645
But, Mr. conductor,

24:05.653 --> 24:08.190
without your sparkle or the lost engine,

24:08.197 --> 24:10.313
you can't travel here to help us anymore.

24:10.324 --> 24:12.189
I'll solve the problem.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.407
You just go to sleep now.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.784
Easy for you to say.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.300
Sparkle, gold dust, magic,

24:35.307 --> 24:38.049
railroad, buffers, lost engine.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.346
The family told me, as long
as there is a railroad,

24:40.354 --> 24:41.969
there will be Harmony.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.021
As long as there is gold
dust, there will be energy.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.942
You will never have to worry.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.078
Yeah, sure.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.871
Mr. c?

25:09.967 --> 25:10.967
Mr. ci

25:13.053 --> 25:15.385
why aren't you here?

25:15.389 --> 25:18.472
Why couldn't you travel
anymore to the island of sodor

25:19.768 --> 25:22.305
or back home here to us in shining time?

25:25.941 --> 25:27.727
The magic is all gone.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.778
What's going wrong with
our railroad and why?

25:39.788 --> 25:41.278
My universe is in danger.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.072
I've got to find more gold dust!

25:48.797 --> 25:50.753
Next morning,
mutt traveled with Billy

25:50.758 --> 25:52.669
to the big city station.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.042
Mutt was sure Lily could help her grandpa,

25:55.054 --> 25:57.295
and that together they could help me,

25:57.306 --> 26:00.639
but only if Lily met someone
special at shining time first.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.892
The train for
muffle mountain will depart

26:03.896 --> 26:06.308
from track 3, last stop, muffle mountain.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.473
The train for shining time
will depart from track 4.

26:20.245 --> 26:24.534
I don't suppose you know
where track 3 is, do you?

26:25.834 --> 26:26.834
You do?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.743
Is it that one?

26:29.755 --> 26:31.211
Well, why not?

26:34.134 --> 26:36.170
I hope you're right.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.260
Mutt was
feeling pleased with himself.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.254
He had put Lily on the wrong train

26:40.265 --> 26:42.972
but he knew he had done
so for the right reasons.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.067
Ji know how the moon must feel j

26:57.074 --> 27:01.113
j looking down from the heavens j

27:01.120 --> 27:04.612
j smiling at the silly things 7

27:04.623 --> 27:08.457
j we put ourselves through j

27:08.460 --> 27:12.169
j missing magic each day j

27:12.172 --> 27:16.165
j and not seeing the wonder j

27:16.176 --> 27:19.509
j that's how the moon j

27:19.513 --> 27:24.473
j must feel

27:27.563 --> 27:30.896
ji know how the moon must feel j

27:30.899 --> 27:34.892
j when he makes someone happy j

27:34.903 --> 27:38.361
j that's the feeling I will feel j

27:38.365 --> 27:42.449
j when you smile at me j

27:42.452 --> 27:46.115
j I'll be floating on air j;

27:46.123 --> 27:50.116
j I'll be beaming with wonder j

27:50.127 --> 27:53.790
j that's how the moon j

27:53.797 --> 27:56.163
j must feel

28:20.240 --> 28:23.232
Left a bit... ah! Right a bit.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.320
Up a bit!

28:27.331 --> 28:29.822
There, James. Tickle all gone now?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.915
No. Still itchy.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.535
Hey, Mr. c, why do you look so tired?

28:34.546 --> 28:35.911
Is it because I'm red?

28:35.923 --> 28:38.289
Diesel says red is a very tiring color.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.417
But, Mr. c, red looks so
nice against the snow.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.794
It's not me, is it?

28:43.805 --> 28:46.968
No, of course not, James.
Red is bright and cheerful.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.261
- Oh, good.
- Just like my sparkle.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.261
Or at least it was, and must be again!

28:55.025 --> 28:57.061
Oh, I'm sorry James. I'm
going to the windmill

28:57.069 --> 28:59.310
to search for something important.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.277
Now off to work, please.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.397
Okay Mr. c. Keep your steam up.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.876
What happened? Where's the windmill?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.415
That's where I'm supposed to be.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.378
Now I've completely lost
my sense of direction.

29:38.944 --> 29:39.944
Oh...

29:40.904 --> 29:44.271
Now my gold dust really is all gone.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.239
If I can't find the
source for making more,

29:46.243 --> 29:47.904
I know how bad the consequences will be.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.697
I saw them in my dream last night.

29:51.123 --> 29:55.708
My family never told me what
to do in a gold dust crisis.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.544
They only said, "if you
can't remember the clue,

29:58.547 --> 30:00.458
"the windmill will remind you."

30:01.466 --> 30:02.751
But where is the windmill?

30:05.762 --> 30:06.762
And what is the clue?

30:07.764 --> 30:11.006
Smile, you
steamers. It's a sunny day.

30:11.018 --> 30:11.973
It's not sunny,

30:11.977 --> 30:14.844
'cause Mr. c's not at
the windmill, I looked.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.937
I think his sparkle's all gone.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.147
My smoke box doesn't feel sunny.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.937
It feels stuffed up.

30:20.944 --> 30:23.481
Nasty fumes from dingy diesel.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.570
And diesel is
after the lost engine.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.905
And if he finds her,

30:26.908 --> 30:28.773
I fear that will destroy us all.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.151
What, even
an engine as big as me?

30:31.163 --> 30:32.869
Yes, Gordon, even you.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.534
Say it, don't spray it, Thomas.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.161
I've still got
sneezing powder up my funnel.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.789
Now I'm going to look for Mr. conductor.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.040
Let us get back to work.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.917
That's what he would want.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.589
How about a race, Thomas?

30:48.597 --> 30:50.963
Sorry, bertie. I can't today.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.714
I have to be a really useful engine

30:52.726 --> 30:54.512
and solve some mysteries instead.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.679
I guess that means I win.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.687
Perhaps another day.

31:04.321 --> 31:05.321
What's that?

31:08.658 --> 31:09.658
What's this?

31:13.372 --> 31:16.239
"I notice you left your
thinking cap behind.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.036
"Try these instead.
They're good for the brain.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.784
"Gone fishing. Rabbit."

31:24.466 --> 31:25.831
Well, well, well!

31:27.969 --> 31:29.379
How very thoughtful.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.312
Plane, drain.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.820
Mountain, fountain.

31:49.825 --> 31:52.407
That might be something. I
think I'll try the celery.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.376
Sausage, bicycle.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.214
Toothpaste, beach.

32:07.217 --> 32:08.217
Wait a minute.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.547
Beach.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.467
Beach! That's it! That's it!

32:16.810 --> 32:18.675
T have to find a bellflower.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.722
I need to make a call.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.854
J it's a summer Sunday and I'm under?

32:26.862 --> 32:30.605
J a cloud that shades
my happiest blunder j

32:30.615 --> 32:33.573
j catching the wave of another

32:33.577 --> 32:36.865
j this easy life oh j

32:36.872 --> 32:40.285
j I never thought that I j

32:40.292 --> 32:44.911
j could ever give my life to one girl

32:44.921 --> 32:47.207
ji feel like I'm finished j

32:47.215 --> 32:50.423
j washed up and unaccomplished 7

32:50.427 --> 32:53.385
j I've dissolved too soon j

32:58.894 --> 33:01.761
J thinking of swimming on a Sunday j

33:01.771 --> 33:06.731
j to a lady more fair than
the spray and the cool j

33:09.070 --> 33:10.150
= hah!

33:15.202 --> 33:17.067
That's my shell phone!

33:20.916 --> 33:24.158
Hello?
= junior? Junior is that you?

33:24.169 --> 33:28.162
Oh, hi, cuz. Are you in a tunnel?

33:28.381 --> 33:30.121
This isn't a very good line.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.457
Junior, where are you?

33:32.594 --> 33:35.381
Um... I'm in paradise.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.754
I got on cloud nine, and here I am.

33:37.766 --> 33:38.801
Junior listen to me,

33:38.808 --> 33:41.094
you've got to come to the
island of sodor right now.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.390
Now? But I'm waiting
on the perfect wave!

33:44.397 --> 33:46.388
Oh, no, you're not! You're coming here.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.645
You have to help me find the source

33:49.653 --> 33:51.735
of our family's gold dust.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.978
What is the source?

33:52.989 --> 33:55.696
= that's the trouble. I haven't a clue.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.407
And I've used up most
of my gold dust, too.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.411
What?

34:01.248 --> 34:03.955
Then go to shining time station first,

34:03.959 --> 34:06.792
and in my signal house, in
the box under the staircase,

34:06.795 --> 34:10.754
you'll find my emergency whistle
with the last of my supply.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.277
Please take care of this junior and...

34:13.677 --> 34:16.339
Don't talk to anyone about the buffers!

34:16.346 --> 34:17.346
What buffers?

34:17.472 --> 34:19.212
= shh!

34:19.432 --> 34:21.297
This is a really bad line.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.227
Hello!

34:24.479 --> 34:27.346
My shell phone's not working properly.

34:27.566 --> 34:30.649
Junior, you've got to come here right
away, I'm counting on you!

34:30.860 --> 34:31.860
Hello?

34:35.782 --> 34:36.782
I want my money back.

34:49.337 --> 34:53.046
Shining time? What does that mean?

34:54.217 --> 34:56.128
Do you want me to get off here?

35:05.854 --> 35:07.060
Where is everyone?

35:08.815 --> 35:10.430
What have you brought me here for?

35:13.236 --> 35:16.524
That's gonna leave a Mark! Oh!

35:16.531 --> 35:18.647
Maybe it's in here.

35:18.658 --> 35:19.658
Oh, cake!

35:20.452 --> 35:21.452
Ugh, that's not cake!

35:22.412 --> 35:24.152
How cute. Six little...

35:24.164 --> 35:26.655
Five little glass figurines.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.666
Ooh! Hello?

35:35.175 --> 35:37.416
This is too much. I've got
to get back to the island.

35:37.427 --> 35:38.712
I've got to get to cuzin.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.638
Hiya. Who are you?

35:44.726 --> 35:46.466
I'm Lily. Who are you?

35:46.478 --> 35:47.478
= c. Junior.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.225
Did I drop some sunglasses
when I came in here?

35:53.777 --> 35:54.777
= t don't know.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.981
Oh, well, I might as well
use some more of this stuff.

36:01.785 --> 36:02.785
See you, Lily.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.376
What is this stuff?

36:31.648 --> 36:34.811
The magic is gone.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.774
Why did I take my gold dust for granted?

36:38.446 --> 36:41.734
I can't help without my gold dust.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.991
What is the source of my gold dust?

36:52.627 --> 36:53.707
Is someone there?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.703
Thomas, is that you?

36:59.467 --> 37:00.707
Mr. conductor?

37:00.719 --> 37:02.300
Mr. conductor! = Thomas?

37:03.555 --> 37:06.046
Oh, Mr.
Conductor, where are you?

37:09.352 --> 37:10.352
Thomas?

37:15.483 --> 37:18.816
How could I possibly say
that I'm really useful now?

37:27.036 --> 37:29.527
Excuse me. Are you Lily?

37:29.539 --> 37:30.654
Yeah.

37:30.665 --> 37:34.533
Hi. I'm Stacy Jones. I'm manager here.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.500
Your grandpa's very upset.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.961
You must've gotten on the wrong train.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.796
I'll take you back to muffle mountain.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.800
Thank you.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.802
Stacy, did you know my grandma?

37:45.805 --> 37:46.965
My mother did.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.760
She said Tasha was a wonderful dancer.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.894
I think grandpa
liked to call grandma "lady."

37:54.898 --> 37:55.728
Lady?

37:55.732 --> 37:56.517
Yes.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.936
I heard him say that name
when they were talking.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.524
I wish...

38:00.528 --> 38:01.893
Oh, never mind.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.855
Turn right
here, you can't miss it.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.199
Stacy, I'm a little nervous.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.785
Well, maybe
your grandpa is, too.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.075
It's been a while since
you've seen each other.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.998
Thanks a lot.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.263
Hello, Burnett.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.557
Stacy.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.716
Hello, Lily.

38:32.727 --> 38:33.727
Hi, grandpa.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.183
Have a good evening.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.812
Thanks, Stacy. Good night.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.902
Stacy? =- hmm?

38:43.905 --> 38:45.736
You said, "I wish...”

38:45.740 --> 38:46.740
= t wish?

38:47.534 --> 38:48.569
Oh, yes.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.694
I wish you'd come back and see
us tomorrow at shining time.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.241
If your grandpa lets you.

39:20.358 --> 39:23.521
Here, grandpa. This
is a friendship bracelet.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.315
Grandma taught me how to
make one when I was little.

39:26.322 --> 39:27.562
This one's for you.

39:29.158 --> 39:34.118
Thank you, Lily.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.888
As the
sound of lady's magic echoed

40:39.896 --> 40:42.387
through the night on muffle mountain,

40:42.398 --> 40:45.561
the engines on sodor had her
very much in their thoughts,

40:57.872 --> 41:00.204
Thomas, I was thinking.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.041
How does Mr. conductor travel here?

41:03.044 --> 41:04.625
By gold dust.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.085
But if there's a lost engine,

41:06.089 --> 41:08.501
maybe there's a lost railway, too.

41:08.508 --> 41:10.464
Mr. conductor's railway!

41:10.468 --> 41:12.925
The journey
gets bumpier and bumpier.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.386
That's what Mr. conductor told me.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.177
Oh! He talked
about buffers in his sleep!

41:18.184 --> 41:20.300
Buffers are at the end of a railway.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.394
I think that's how he travels
here, on a secret railway.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.935
Belonging to the lost engine!

41:25.942 --> 41:28.183
Percy, you are clever.

41:28.194 --> 41:31.106
Oh! My wheels are suddenly
feeling very wobbly.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.230
T think diesel's around here!

41:34.450 --> 41:36.657
Diesel heard every word you said.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.822
I'm going after him to
see what he does next.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.037
You'd better get the mail delivered.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.951
You're very brave, Toby.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.325
Diesel won't bother
with an old engine like me.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.793
He thinks I'm really useless.

41:47.797 --> 41:50.834
J I've been working on the railway j»

41:50.842 --> 41:53.584
j all the livelong day j

41:53.594 --> 41:55.550
who wants to work a livelong day anyway?

41:59.475 --> 42:00.475
There he is.

42:01.561 --> 42:05.474
Come in! Come in
and join the party, splodge!

42:05.481 --> 42:07.472
Hooray!
We're gonna have a party.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.690
- I love parties.
- Who's got the balloons?

42:09.694 --> 42:10.809
What?

42:12.613 --> 42:15.776
Correction.
Join the party that's over.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.950
Just like twinkle toe's magic
railway is gonna be over.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.410
Hmm.

42:21.414 --> 42:25.783
Gone, like the lost engine and
the buffers that lead to her.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.415
What are you gonna do?

42:29.422 --> 42:30.878
That's a good question.

42:30.882 --> 42:35.091
It's time to put
twinkle toes' lights out.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.004
Ooh.

42:36.012 --> 42:38.799
This is a job for the boss!

42:40.475 --> 42:41.305
I've got to delay him.

42:41.309 --> 42:42.845
I've got to distract him. Hmm.

42:46.856 --> 42:49.518
It's the old teapot! Smash him!

42:56.449 --> 42:57.564
Pinchy, get back here!

42:57.575 --> 43:00.191
I hate it when you do this!

43:00.203 --> 43:01.989
Good show!

43:01.996 --> 43:05.705
Uh, boss, did you
mean to let the roof fall in?

43:05.708 --> 43:07.664
All the way in?

43:07.668 --> 43:12.207
I always mean
what I do, you rattle traps!

43:14.300 --> 43:15.790
Diesel was in a dump,

43:15.802 --> 43:18.384
but the steam engines
were still right on track.

43:20.598 --> 43:24.807
J he's a really useful engine you know j

43:24.811 --> 43:29.180
js all the other engines
they'll tell you so j

43:29.190 --> 43:31.602
j he huffs and puffs and whistles j

43:31.609 --> 43:33.645
j rushing to and fro j

43:33.653 --> 43:37.862
j he's the really useful engine we adore j

43:37.865 --> 43:42.655
j he's a really useful engine you know j

43:42.662 --> 43:47.156
j "cause the fat
controller he told him so j

43:47.166 --> 43:51.535
j now he's got a workshop
to call his very own j

43:51.546 --> 43:56.131
j he's the really useful engine we adore j

43:56.134 --> 43:58.500
j he's the one j

43:58.511 --> 44:01.093
j he's the number one j

44:01.097 --> 44:04.965
j Thomas the tank engine j

44:04.976 --> 44:08.719
j he's the really useful engine j

44:08.729 --> 44:11.015
j we adore j

44:14.235 --> 44:16.942
morning,
Henry. What's the matter?

44:16.946 --> 44:18.186
I've got boiler ache.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.562
And I'm
collecting one, two, three,

44:19.574 --> 44:20.609
four, five, six trucks

44:20.616 --> 44:23.358
of special island of sodor coal for you.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.825
Oh, thank you, Thomas.

44:24.829 --> 44:28.321
Special coal will make me
feel much better.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.118
But I wish I
could make Mr. conductor

44:30.126 --> 44:31.866
feel better too, by finding him.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.304
Hello, Thomas
and your five coal trucks.

44:45.308 --> 44:48.516
Five? But I'm
supposed to have six.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.264
Hello, Percy.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.979
Oh, Thomas, I've
been worried about you.

44:53.983 --> 44:56.190
Bertie says you lost a coal truck today.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.104
Yes.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.897
It disappeared when I was at the buffers

44:58.905 --> 45:00.395
near the little grotto.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.612
Maybe those are the buffers

45:01.616 --> 45:03.572
that lead to the secret railway.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.487
And the grotto
is the lost engine's

45:05.494 --> 45:07.234
special platform!

45:07.246 --> 45:08.076
Yes!

45:08.080 --> 45:10.822
Percy, you protect
those buffers from diesel.

45:10.833 --> 45:11.663
What?

45:11.667 --> 45:13.328
And I'll find Mr. conductor.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.372
Me! Why me?

45:15.379 --> 45:18.041
Because you're
a brave engine, Percy.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.334
Oh, I forgot.

45:28.517 --> 45:33.557
Hello, twinkle
toes! Remember me?

45:33.564 --> 45:36.897
Fat hatt won't have much use
for you looking like that.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.904
Oh, I see you forgot to bring the sugar.

45:46.911 --> 45:49.698
How careless of you. Say hello to pinchy!

45:59.674 --> 46:03.383
Okay, twinkle toes, I
know about the buffers.

46:06.514 --> 46:07.503
That's what I saw in my dream!

46:07.515 --> 46:08.846
It's coming true!

46:10.309 --> 46:12.550
My universe is starting to crumble!

46:12.561 --> 46:15.473
And I know
about the magic railway.

46:15.481 --> 46:20.020
And when I find that engine,
you and all those puffballs

46:20.027 --> 46:21.233
will be history!

46:22.238 --> 46:24.149
Now tell me where the buffers are! Now!

46:29.245 --> 46:31.452
You got 10 seconds.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.320
10, nine,

46:35.042 --> 46:37.784
eight, seven,

46:39.088 --> 46:40.088
six, five,

46:43.301 --> 46:45.883
four, three, two...

46:48.639 --> 46:49.719
Too late, diesel!

47:00.276 --> 47:02.938
Did you put all this here for me?

47:02.945 --> 47:05.778
You must've known that I
was coming. How kind of you.

47:07.450 --> 47:10.237
Oh! I'm at the windmill.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.030
That's what I call a perfect landing.

47:15.124 --> 47:18.787
This must be the clue to unlock
the source of the gold dust.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.411
Stoke up the magic in the mountain

47:22.423 --> 47:24.288
and the lady will smile.

47:27.887 --> 47:31.505
Then watch the swirls that spin so well.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.430
Where has the writing gone?

47:38.314 --> 47:39.099
So, boss...

47:39.315 --> 47:41.155
How come you
let twinkle toes escape?

47:41.233 --> 47:42.723
Yeah.

47:42.943 --> 47:46.276
Oh, that! Well,
uh, I did it on purpose.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.738
You know, I was testing him to
see if he could escape.

47:49.742 --> 47:51.152
- Liar, liar.
- Pants on fire.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.195
Does he wear pants? = no.

47:52.203 --> 47:53.488
- Well, training pants.
- Oh, right.

47:53.496 --> 47:56.488
All right!
Playtime's over, splodge.

47:56.499 --> 47:57.739
Uh-oh.

47:57.750 --> 48:00.116
Now it's time
for the next lesson, huh?

48:00.127 --> 48:02.994
I call it "how to stop being stupid.”

48:03.672 --> 48:05.003
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.633
That's gonna ruin my facial.

48:13.849 --> 48:14.849
Oh.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.142
Bet you can't climb that tree.

48:43.504 --> 48:44.504
See?

48:45.297 --> 48:46.457
Where'd you learn to do that?

48:46.465 --> 48:48.421
On my fire escape.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.257
= hi. I'm patch.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.627
I'm Lily. Do you live around here?

48:52.638 --> 48:55.596
Yes. My mom
and dad run the stables.

48:55.599 --> 48:58.341
- Morning, patch.
- Good morning, Mr. stone.

48:58.352 --> 49:00.934
I'm riding into shining town.
Could Lily come with me?

49:00.938 --> 49:02.724
If she'd like to. = I'd like to.

49:05.734 --> 49:08.146
Sure, she can go.

49:09.238 --> 49:10.478
Be back by sunset, Lily.

49:13.826 --> 49:15.032
Do you wanna come, too?

49:16.245 --> 49:18.782
I never go there now.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Bye, grandpa.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.956
So, have you ever ridden a horse before?

49:25.963 --> 49:27.544
= no.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.308
I've always
wanted to go this way.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.856
We're following some shadowy
lines I've seen on a map.

49:50.863 --> 49:53.195
They're like railroad
tracks without any rails.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.036
Well, lady, what are we to do?

50:07.379 --> 50:11.338
It all seemed so much easier
when Tasha and I were children.

50:27.942 --> 50:28.942
= junior?

50:29.944 --> 50:31.354
Presto!

50:31.362 --> 50:33.273
I'd given up on seeing you again.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.566
What's blue, green and
red and goes beep-beep?

50:36.867 --> 50:39.358
A parrot and you mean chirp-chirp.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.611
No, trains. Talking trains.

50:41.622 --> 50:42.657
And I'm off to see them right now

50:42.665 --> 50:45.031
in the island of sodor, and cuzin.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.328
But I overslept and I'm
in a bit of a hurry.

50:47.336 --> 50:48.416
Do you want to come?

50:48.420 --> 50:50.160
Can we be back here by sunset?

50:50.172 --> 50:52.754
I hope so. I wanna
get back to the beach.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.874
What do you think, mutt?

50:55.886 --> 50:58.002
Okay. - Good.

50:58.013 --> 51:01.176
It's this way.

51:01.183 --> 51:02.423
We'll take the shortcut.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.851
- Really?
- Hmm...

51:06.897 --> 51:08.728
There's two of us.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.643
Oh, well.

51:11.527 --> 51:15.236
That means I'll have to use
cuz' extra supply of gold dust.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.079
It doesn't matter, we'll
have plenty more soon.

51:19.285 --> 51:21.867
Can I take this little
bit back for grandpa?

51:21.870 --> 51:22.870
Be my guest.

51:23.747 --> 51:25.157
I'll take care of it for you.

51:27.793 --> 51:29.203
Ready? Here goes.

51:43.559 --> 51:44.799
You've grown bigger.

51:44.810 --> 51:46.471
Maybe you're smaller.

51:46.478 --> 51:48.343
I'm adjusting to my new surroundings.

51:49.398 --> 51:52.105
This is the only place
this ever happens to me.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.521
Whoa!

51:54.528 --> 51:56.064
A bit bouncy, isn't it?

51:56.071 --> 51:58.232
- Where are we?
- Conductor's railroad.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.531
- Magic railroad?
- Whatever.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.776
We're traveling miles
and miles to the island.

52:05.247 --> 52:09.866
But I don't know if this
railroad's gonna last much longer.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.455
It'll vanish like the engine.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.748
What engine?

52:13.756 --> 52:16.338
The engine that used to
travel on this railroad.

52:16.342 --> 52:17.957
Cuz and I never saw it.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.050
We don't know what happened to it.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.094
Hey, what's that doing there?

52:23.098 --> 52:24.258
You ready, Lily?

52:24.266 --> 52:25.301
Here are the buffers.

52:27.561 --> 52:28.561
Now!

52:35.527 --> 52:36.527
Where are we?

52:40.240 --> 52:42.652
The island of sodor, of course.

52:42.660 --> 52:43.660
This way.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.373
Oh, bogus! - What's the matter?

52:51.377 --> 52:52.913
I think I'm allergic to grass.

52:59.593 --> 53:02.630
It's a good thing
I like climbing things.

53:02.638 --> 53:03.638
Grass.

53:05.766 --> 53:06.596
What's that noise?

53:06.600 --> 53:08.932
The trains, I told you, they talk.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.018
We're just too far away to
hear what they're saying.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.730
Good morning.

53:22.741 --> 53:25.107
Annie! Clarabel!
There's Mr. conductor!

53:25.119 --> 53:26.154
We found him!

53:27.079 --> 53:29.946
Oh, bunko! It's junior.

53:31.667 --> 53:34.079
- Junior, look!
- It's Thomas!

53:37.548 --> 53:40.756
Thomas, how, don't look so surprised.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.044
I know you haven't seen me since...

53:42.052 --> 53:45.010
You stuffed party poppers down my funnel!

53:45.013 --> 53:47.379
- We had a laugh.
- You did.

53:48.851 --> 53:50.136
You're talking to each other.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.351
Ah! First prize.

53:52.354 --> 53:55.767
Lily, Thomas. Thomas, Lily.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.935
Now, where's my cuzin?

53:57.943 --> 53:58.932
Hi.

53:58.944 --> 54:01.060
Hello, Lily. Welcome to sodor.

54:02.072 --> 54:05.155
= come on, Lily,
I'm very at home on trains.

54:05.159 --> 54:09.368
Annie clarabel I'll
send Percy back to fetch you.

54:09.371 --> 54:12.408
We've heard that one before.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.705
What's the matter?
= travel sickness.

54:22.926 --> 54:25.463
What's that
shining at the windmill?

54:25.471 --> 54:28.508
Presto, Lily. I think it's my cuzin!

54:30.768 --> 54:32.368
Mr. conductor, Mr. conductor!

54:32.561 --> 54:35.598
- Thomas!
- Thank throttles you're safe!

54:37.733 --> 54:38.733
Come on, Lily.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.153
Hey, cuz, what's up?

54:45.157 --> 54:48.570
Enjoying the sun?
No, junior, I am not.

54:48.577 --> 54:50.113
As a matter of fact, I just landed here

54:50.120 --> 54:52.702
after escaping a heavy metal monster.

54:52.706 --> 54:55.948
Junior, where have you been?

54:55.959 --> 54:58.200
Is your sparkle
back, Mr. conductor?

54:59.755 --> 55:03.668
No, Thomas, it isn't.
But I do know the clue.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.127
Stoke up the magic in the mountain...

55:12.643 --> 55:13.723
Darn!

55:13.727 --> 55:14.727
Dither!

55:15.938 --> 55:19.601
Hey, cuz, you're looking terrible.

55:19.608 --> 55:23.066
Why don't we get more gold
dust 'cause I used yours up.

55:23.070 --> 55:27.985
Then you can go back home
and I can go to the beach.

55:27.991 --> 55:31.154
Junior, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.699
Uh-oh.

55:34.706 --> 55:36.321
- I'll get that.
- I've got it.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.789
Hello?

55:40.337 --> 55:42.498
No, this is his cuzin.

55:43.799 --> 55:45.084
Give the phone.

55:45.092 --> 55:46.298
Who's this?

55:46.301 --> 55:48.383
Oh, hello, Hattie.

55:48.387 --> 55:52.972
No, no. He's hanging
around here somewhere.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.717
Yes, sir topham hatt, sir.

55:57.646 --> 55:59.432
No, he just wanted to be friendly.

56:00.899 --> 56:02.264
No, he is not a dog.

56:03.235 --> 56:06.523
Let's just say he's a puppy
in need of a good trainer.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.113
No, nothing to worry about, sir.

56:11.785 --> 56:12.785
Goodbye, sir.

56:14.204 --> 56:16.616
Cuz, this is Lily.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.238
She's staying with grandpa stone.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.168
Hello, Lily.

56:23.171 --> 56:25.002
= hello.

56:27.134 --> 56:29.967
- Junior? Junior?
- Whoa!

56:34.683 --> 56:37.390
What are you doing up there? Come down.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.930
It's too windy!

56:38.937 --> 56:41.679
This is just like the fun fair!

56:41.690 --> 56:44.352
Give us two seconds. Whoo-hoo!

56:44.359 --> 56:48.648
Two seconds is all it takes
for you to land in trouble!

57:03.253 --> 57:06.086
= ah-ha! Twinkle toes junior!

57:07.132 --> 57:08.872
Oh, no, my beach bag!

57:08.884 --> 57:13.298
You won't be doing any
surfing up here, Mr. kahuna.

57:13.305 --> 57:14.715
Really? Watch me.

57:14.723 --> 57:17.635
Hang on tight, moon doggie!

57:17.643 --> 57:18.643
Yee-haw!

57:19.478 --> 57:21.594
Diesel's hijacked him!

57:21.605 --> 57:24.312
What's gonna happen to junior now?

57:24.316 --> 57:25.772
My family's usually pretty good

57:25.776 --> 57:28.939
at getting themselves out
of trouble, eventually.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.777
I don't know
what eventually means

57:30.781 --> 57:33.022
but it sounds very, very long.

57:42.918 --> 57:45.534
- Where's Lily?
- I wish I knew.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.291
I'm sorry, Mr. stone.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.880
She wasn't at the station
when I went back for her.

57:54.554 --> 57:55.554
It's okay, patch.

57:56.974 --> 57:59.135
We'll find her. Don't worry.

58:09.736 --> 58:12.398
I am brave. I am brave.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.943
Thomas says I'm brave, so I'm brave.

58:18.161 --> 58:20.618
Oh! It's not easy being brave.

58:21.873 --> 58:25.661
Shiver my pistons! There's
splatter and dodge!

58:25.669 --> 58:30.629
Oh! They found the buffers.
Oh, now what's going to happen?

58:34.136 --> 58:36.969
Howdy partner. Excuse me.

58:36.972 --> 58:38.332
Oh, that's just nothing.

58:40.142 --> 58:42.007
Ah! That nothing was something.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.886
These must be the
buffers diesel's looking for.

58:44.896 --> 58:46.761
Are we supposed
to go through them?

58:46.773 --> 58:48.058
Not we, you.

58:48.066 --> 58:49.146
Not me, you.

58:50.569 --> 58:52.355
This is a job for the boss.

58:54.990 --> 58:56.025
We'll tell him tomorrow.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.398
Yeah, tomorrow's good.

58:58.744 --> 59:00.784
Oh, I'd better
hurry back and warn Thomas.

59:09.880 --> 59:13.122
I was doing
my best to keep Lily cheerful.

59:13.133 --> 59:16.717
I knew she was worried about
being late for her grandpa,

59:16.720 --> 59:19.757
Mr. conductor, I was
supposed to be back by sunset.

59:19.765 --> 59:22.723
You know, Lily, perhaps
your grandpa can guess

59:22.726 --> 59:23.556
where you are.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.346
- He can?
- Maybe.

59:25.353 --> 59:28.766
Because I think he's been
here himself, long ago.

59:28.774 --> 59:30.856
And if he can help, I do wish he'd hurry.

59:30.859 --> 59:31.939
I haven't told junior this,

59:31.943 --> 59:33.899
but soon he'll grow as weak as I am.

59:37.783 --> 59:39.398
Junior said there used to be an engine

59:39.409 --> 59:41.149
that traveled on the magic railroad.

59:42.287 --> 59:43.367
And if only we could find

59:43.371 --> 59:45.282
that we could still head
back to shining time.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.827
Oh, that engine disappeared.

59:47.834 --> 59:49.699
Never to be seen or heard from again.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.370
I have to tell you something, Mr. c.

59:54.508 --> 59:55.543
I've heard a train whistle

59:55.550 --> 1:00:00.294
and it sounded like it
came from the mountain.

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:04.173
Mountain. I just remembered
another part of the clue.

1:00:04.184 --> 1:00:06.095
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain

1:00:06.103 --> 1:00:07.934
"and the lady will smile.”

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:12.142
But we need more information, Lily.

1:00:12.150 --> 1:00:13.435
And I know that your grandpa

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:16.651
could help if he would
just believe that he could.

1:00:18.156 --> 1:00:19.156
Lady?

1:00:21.910 --> 1:00:24.697
= she can whistle. I've heard her.

1:00:27.666 --> 1:00:29.076
Yeah, so have I.

1:00:31.378 --> 1:00:32.709
It's because she's magic.

1:00:35.924 --> 1:00:38.131
This must be the map
of her magic railroad.

1:00:39.010 --> 1:00:42.673
But the railroad"s energy is fading away.

1:00:42.681 --> 1:00:45.138
I sensed it when we were out riding.

1:00:45.142 --> 1:00:47.554
Lily and I were traveling
on the ground above it.

1:00:47.561 --> 1:00:49.051
The railroad needs lady

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.220
but I don't know her special secret.

1:00:53.608 --> 1:00:56.350
And I need to know it now more than ever.

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:58.977
- Because of Lily?
- Yes, because of Lily.

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:03.865
So Thomas we must get
Lily back to her grandpa now

1:01:03.869 --> 1:01:06.906
in case diesel gets rid of the railway.

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:09.620
But how can
Lily go without gold dust?

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:11.114
Only in the lost engine.

1:01:14.838 --> 1:01:15.838
Unless. - Unless?

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:21.292
Thomas, will you please take Lily?

1:01:21.303 --> 1:01:22.668
Through the buffers?

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:25.887
But what if I go on the railway
and my wheels don't work?

1:01:25.891 --> 1:01:28.598
- But what if they do?
- But what if, if...

1:01:29.603 --> 1:01:31.594
- Yes?
- What if it's dark?

1:01:31.605 --> 1:01:34.221
- It will be for a while.
- And cold.

1:01:34.232 --> 1:01:35.187
Maybe.

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:37.057
And how will I get back again?

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:40.060
Because you're a really useful
engine and will find a way.

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:47.529
Then I'll try.

1:02:03.303 --> 1:02:05.223
I promise I'll get you
home to your grandpa Lily.

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:06.574
Follow me, partner.

1:02:07.474 --> 1:02:09.076
Right this way to bufferville.

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:12.183
- Just a walk in the park.
- We're going through, Lily.

1:02:12.187 --> 1:02:13.097
You're on your own

1:02:13.104 --> 1:02:15.345
from here on in, little blue buckaroo!

1:02:15.357 --> 1:02:18.440
Little engines
can do big things.

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:23.854
It is dark and cold and bumpy

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:26.940
but I'm not afraid.

1:02:26.952 --> 1:02:29.534
Oh, there's the missing coal truck.

1:02:29.537 --> 1:02:30.777
= coal truck?

1:02:32.123 --> 1:02:33.954
"Stoke up the magic in the mountain.”

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:37.917
That's part of Mr. conductor's
clue to his gold dust.

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:40.503
And, Lily, that's
what you do with coal,

1:02:40.507 --> 1:02:42.213
stoke it up to make steam.

1:02:45.053 --> 1:02:48.671
We're going to be really
reliable and help Mr. conductor.

1:02:48.682 --> 1:02:50.638
We're going back for that coal truck.

1:02:58.233 --> 1:03:00.269
Buffers. Coal truck.

1:03:00.277 --> 1:03:02.438
We're starting to solve
the mysteries, Lily.

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:13.278
You're a really useful engine, Thomas.

1:03:27.095 --> 1:03:30.428
- Lily, where are we?
- Muffle mountain, Thomas.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:34.136
I think I feel a little dizzy.

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:38.137
I can't go any further.
My wheels won't let me.

1:03:38.148 --> 1:03:40.059
Then I'll be back, Thomas, I promise.

1:03:40.066 --> 1:03:41.772
But I must find grandpa.

1:03:42.944 --> 1:03:44.775
It's getting windy up here.

1:03:53.747 --> 1:03:54.953
Bust my boiler!

1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:00.116
I've left the coal truck behind!

1:04:04.924 --> 1:04:07.791
Where's grandpa? Can you take me to him?

1:04:07.802 --> 1:04:10.293
- Jump up.
- Patch, I knew I could count on you.

1:04:10.305 --> 1:04:11.841
Stop, wheels. Stop!

1:04:18.605 --> 1:04:23.565
Whoa!

1:04:31.034 --> 1:04:32.365
Grandpa!

1:04:32.369 --> 1:04:35.736
Oh, Lily. I'm so glad to see you.

1:04:35.747 --> 1:04:37.612
There's this island with talking trains

1:04:37.624 --> 1:04:39.740
and they said you might have been there.

1:04:39.751 --> 1:04:42.868
But Mr. conductor's very
sick and junior's in danger

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:45.370
and I had to leave poor Thomas behind.

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:46.382
Please help me.

1:04:50.970 --> 1:04:53.757
I'd like to, Lily.
Nothing seems to work.

1:04:57.227 --> 1:04:59.934
This is the lost engine from long ago.

1:04:59.938 --> 1:05:00.927
Now we can go back to the island

1:05:00.939 --> 1:05:03.601
and bring Mr. conductor and junior home.

1:05:03.608 --> 1:05:05.519
= t can't make her steam.

1:05:05.527 --> 1:05:07.939
I've tried all the different
coals in the valley.

1:05:11.699 --> 1:05:13.314
Lady.

1:05:13.326 --> 1:05:16.113
Is that her name? - Yes.

1:05:16.121 --> 1:05:18.954
Coal. Special coal
from the island of sodor.

1:05:18.957 --> 1:05:21.198
That's what lady needs.

1:05:21.209 --> 1:05:24.042
Patch, there's a coal truck
up at the top of the mountain.

1:05:24.045 --> 1:05:26.001
Do you think you could get some?

1:05:26.005 --> 1:05:27.005
= of course I will.

1:05:28.675 --> 1:05:30.211
I'm sorry, Lily and cuz,

1:05:30.218 --> 1:05:33.176
I haven't been responsible,
reliable, really useful...

1:05:33.179 --> 1:05:37.172
But I will be! But I will be!

1:05:43.773 --> 1:05:44.773
James!

1:05:54.868 --> 1:05:57.780
So you've lost
your sparkle, too, huh?

1:06:00.415 --> 1:06:01.825
Bye-bye, twinkle toes.

1:06:03.209 --> 1:06:05.245
Oh! It's empty.

1:06:05.253 --> 1:06:06.834
Here we go.

1:06:06.838 --> 1:06:08.203
Junior, what are we gonna do?

1:06:08.214 --> 1:06:09.829
We'll think of something.

1:06:14.512 --> 1:06:16.218
That's it.

1:06:19.142 --> 1:06:21.804
I'll find you some
more, Lily. I promise.

1:06:21.811 --> 1:06:25.474
But if I'm going to be any
help at all, it's now or never.

1:06:25.482 --> 1:06:28.189
I've got to use up the rest of this stuff.

1:06:28.193 --> 1:06:30.900
- Are you ready?
- No, we're not.

1:06:30.904 --> 1:06:33.816
James the brains, get us out of here.

1:06:36.367 --> 1:06:38.198
Now we are.

1:06:38.203 --> 1:06:39.238
What the...

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:50.203
- Bye, James.
- Bye, junior.

1:06:52.759 --> 1:06:54.295
Sorry I've been so long, cuz.

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:57.419
But better late than never?

1:06:58.389 --> 1:07:01.222
Junior, we are all out
of gold dust, aren't we?

1:07:02.685 --> 1:07:03.685
Bankrupt.

1:07:11.778 --> 1:07:13.393
Hey!

1:07:13.404 --> 1:07:14.610
It's a beautiful day!

1:07:15.949 --> 1:07:17.780
I mean we're down, but we're not out.

1:07:20.203 --> 1:07:21.363
No, we're out...

1:07:23.248 --> 1:07:24.613
But we are not down.

1:07:27.627 --> 1:07:29.663
Did grandma love lady as much as you do?

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:33.041
Did she take a ride on her?

1:07:37.845 --> 1:07:39.801
Grandma loved her because I loved her.

1:07:41.891 --> 1:07:43.506
But she never took a ride on lady.

1:07:45.853 --> 1:07:48.139
T couldn't fix her in time.

1:08:41.993 --> 1:08:43.028
Lily, look.

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:52.020
The railroad's getting its energy back.

1:09:17.779 --> 1:09:22.739
Well, my lady, the lights
are all green for you now.

1:09:23.034 --> 1:09:24.034
Green for glory.

1:09:27.497 --> 1:09:29.988
Tasha would have loved this journey.

1:09:29.999 --> 1:09:31.364
Yes, she would.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.418
And she'd love it that you're with me now.

1:09:47.350 --> 1:09:49.966
So, Burnett, you
didn't forget about magic.

1:09:49.977 --> 1:09:51.342
It's safe inside you.

1:10:10.873 --> 1:10:11.873
= Thomas!

1:10:14.752 --> 1:10:18.791
You've found
her! And she's beautiful!

1:10:32.437 --> 1:10:35.304
We're on the island of sodor.

1:10:35.314 --> 1:10:37.225
Stop, grandpa. Stop, lady.

1:10:42.321 --> 1:10:44.983
Hello, junior. Hello, Mr. c.

1:10:47.201 --> 1:10:49.692
Mr. conductor, this is my grandpa.

1:10:51.122 --> 1:10:53.454
I'm glad you were able
to find your way back.

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:59.540
Junior, do you realize who this is?

1:10:59.547 --> 1:11:01.503
I reckon this is one beautiful engine.

1:11:07.889 --> 1:11:08.889
Oh.

1:11:11.058 --> 1:11:12.343
This is the lost engine.

1:11:13.853 --> 1:11:15.809
Oh, are we glad to see you.

1:11:15.813 --> 1:11:17.519
Now we can go back to shining time.

1:11:22.487 --> 1:11:23.487
= junior.

1:11:24.530 --> 1:11:27.442
We won't make it back to shining
time without the gold dust.

1:11:32.747 --> 1:11:35.705
Without it, the magic can't exist.

1:11:59.106 --> 1:12:02.564
Ah-ha! There's
the blue puffball!

1:12:02.568 --> 1:12:03.853
And look who he's with.

1:12:04.779 --> 1:12:07.486
Splodge, come and destroy.

1:12:07.490 --> 1:12:09.776
- No. You do it yourself.
- We don't like you.

1:12:09.784 --> 1:12:10.990
- We mean that.
- Emphatically.

1:12:10.993 --> 1:12:12.483
Yeah, what does that mean?
= I have no idea.

1:12:12.495 --> 1:12:13.405
It's a good word.

1:12:13.412 --> 1:12:14.652
Run, lady. Quickly!

1:12:14.872 --> 1:12:16.157
And I'm going to help you.

1:12:17.667 --> 1:12:20.579
So am I, m'lady. I'll
not let you down again.

1:12:22.213 --> 1:12:23.874
Who needs you, splodge?

1:12:26.259 --> 1:12:28.420
Watch out for the
viaduct. It's dangerous!

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.470
= what's the matter?

1:12:37.478 --> 1:12:40.436
Lady. That engine's name is lady.

1:12:40.439 --> 1:12:43.101
She's part of the clue to the source of...

1:12:43.109 --> 1:12:44.974
The gold dust!

1:12:48.322 --> 1:12:51.029
Now I'll get you, Burnett stone.

1:12:51.033 --> 1:12:54.901
No, you won't, because the
magic you refuse to believe in

1:12:54.912 --> 1:12:57.244
will get the better of you.

1:12:57.248 --> 1:12:59.660
You can run, but you can't hide.

1:12:59.667 --> 1:13:00.667
Right, pinchy?

1:13:03.045 --> 1:13:05.582
- Pinchy's hungry.
- Get back!

1:13:09.135 --> 1:13:10.135
Come on, lady.

1:13:13.306 --> 1:13:14.637
Coming, puffball.

1:13:20.021 --> 1:13:21.636
Look out!

1:13:23.107 --> 1:13:25.393
Here I come! Duck, pinchy!

1:13:31.908 --> 1:13:36.868
I like my lunch steamed.

1:13:46.005 --> 1:13:47.791
Pretty fast for a puffball.

1:13:55.181 --> 1:13:58.594
Well, lady, this is
your shining time, too.

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:01.805
I hope so.

1:14:04.398 --> 1:14:07.231
Come on, lady. Little
engines can do big things.

1:14:32.093 --> 1:14:34.630
Well done, Thomas! Well done!

1:14:40.142 --> 1:14:41.757
Hey! Ooh! What's going on?

1:14:41.769 --> 1:14:43.134
Oh! Hold it!

1:14:46.983 --> 1:14:47.983
Puffball!

1:14:49.110 --> 1:14:50.110
Teapot!

1:14:51.737 --> 1:14:52.737
Tin kettle!

1:14:57.743 --> 1:15:00.906
Oh, well. Nice time of
the year for a cruise.

1:15:06.419 --> 1:15:08.205
But, Mr. conductor,

1:15:08.212 --> 1:15:10.703
you still don't have your gold dust.

1:15:10.715 --> 1:15:12.171
I think he will soon.

1:15:15.219 --> 1:15:16.219
Wait a minute.

1:15:17.555 --> 1:15:21.343
"Then watch the swirls that spin so well."

1:15:21.350 --> 1:15:22.556
Swirls.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.677
Like the shavings around lady
when we were on the railroad.

1:15:25.688 --> 1:15:28.771
Is there anything else?
= of course there is.

1:15:28.774 --> 1:15:32.107
"So well." A well means water.

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:37.317
Lily, put the shavings in with the water.

1:15:49.462 --> 1:15:52.124
Go ahead, Lily. Throw it up in the air.

1:15:55.718 --> 1:15:57.583
Please! Please!

1:16:02.058 --> 1:16:03.058
Now, Lily.

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:14.604
- Gold dust!
- Gold dust!

1:16:16.906 --> 1:16:18.237
Yay!

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:19.240
= gold dust!

1:16:27.458 --> 1:16:30.746
Lady, you're
a really helpful engine.

1:16:30.753 --> 1:16:32.539
And helping each other

1:16:32.546 --> 1:16:35.834
brings to life the magic in all of us.

1:16:39.678 --> 1:16:42.215
Come on, mutt. Let's look around.

1:16:45.810 --> 1:16:46.810
Lily...

1:16:48.104 --> 1:16:49.685
I think I promised you something.

1:16:53.067 --> 1:16:54.067
Here.

1:16:56.487 --> 1:16:57.487
Take some.

1:17:06.413 --> 1:17:09.120
So, cuz, how else can I help?

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:13.166
You mean, you don't want
to go back to the beach?

1:17:13.170 --> 1:17:14.170
= no.

1:17:15.631 --> 1:17:18.748
Well, maybe for a holiday.

1:17:18.759 --> 1:17:20.545
But I'm ready to work.

1:17:20.553 --> 1:17:22.134
You got a job for me?

1:17:22.138 --> 1:17:24.345
You know, junior, there is a railroad.

1:17:24.348 --> 1:17:26.054
With palm trees? = one or two.

1:17:26.058 --> 1:17:27.764
- And sunshine?
- Sunny spells.

1:17:27.768 --> 1:17:29.258
I'll take it. What's the way?

1:17:35.734 --> 1:17:36.734
This is the way.

1:18:01.260 --> 1:18:04.127
Hello. Oh, yes, sir topham hatt, sir.

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:07.342
You're on your way back right now.

1:18:07.349 --> 1:18:10.557
Splendid news. I'll be at
the sheds to welcome you.

1:18:10.561 --> 1:18:13.348
Oh, yes sir. Everything is under control.

1:18:14.523 --> 1:18:15.523
Goodbye, sir.

1:18:18.235 --> 1:18:21.568
Well, see you in shining time.

1:18:27.119 --> 1:18:28.119
Here, grandpa.

1:18:29.538 --> 1:18:30.823
I'd like you to have this.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:34.910
Well, how sweet of you, Lily.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.245
Here. Give me the bluebird.

1:18:41.550 --> 1:18:42.835
T think we should share it.

1:18:49.350 --> 1:18:53.593
Now we'll always remember
our shining time together.
