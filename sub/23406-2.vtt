01:10.482 --> 01:12.793
- Oh, Matt, that banana
has brown spots on it.

01:12.896 --> 01:14.896
- What? Oh.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.517
Ew.

01:37.551 --> 01:39.517
Who do you think designs
these coffee cups?

01:39.620 --> 01:42.758
- A failed art student in a
massive amount of college debt.

01:42.862 --> 01:45.310
- Feel like I never use
my communications degree.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.206
I mean, I guess
I'm talking right now.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.896
So that's something.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.137
- I majored in English,
and that should be illegal.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.482
- Hey, guys.

01:52.586 --> 01:54.103
Want to see the latest nightmare
I've been living?

01:54.206 --> 01:55.586
- I'd love to.

01:55.689 --> 01:57.413
- This is HD-Whistle.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.206
It's an anonymous whistle
blowing app developed by HR.

02:00.310 --> 02:01.965
If you see someone doing
something bad,

02:02.068 --> 02:05.344
you find the appropriate
category, like embezzlement,

02:05.448 --> 02:08.103
and click "whistle."

02:08.206 --> 02:09.965
And then an upsetting amount
of paperwork

02:10.068 --> 02:12.000
magically appears on my desk.

02:12.103 --> 02:13.586
- Why does it have to
make that sound?

02:13.689 --> 02:14.827
- I don't know.

02:14.931 --> 02:16.413
It reminds me of
walking by a construction site,

02:16.517 --> 02:19.172
or any other place men are.

02:19.275 --> 02:21.551
- Last night I had a dream.

02:21.655 --> 02:23.413
Christian was giving me
a performance review.

02:23.517 --> 02:25.137
- Don't look at me, look down!

02:25.241 --> 02:26.896
- And at the end,
he fired me.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.310
- You're fired.

02:28.413 --> 02:30.724
- Then crushed my skull
with his bare hands.

02:33.137 --> 02:35.000
I was terrified.

02:35.103 --> 02:38.241
But honored to be killed
by someone I respect so much.

02:38.344 --> 02:41.103
- Yeah. Christian can be
a little intimidating.

02:41.206 --> 02:42.551
Talking to him is like...

02:42.655 --> 02:46.034
talking to a gun with
an Ivy League education.

02:46.137 --> 02:47.586
Clean as a whistle.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.689
- Christian is approaching
at a tremendous velocity.

02:52.413 --> 02:54.965
- Oh, no.
He's probably in a bad mood.

02:55.068 --> 02:57.620
John?

02:57.724 --> 03:00.172
- Kate, call everyone
into the conference room.

03:00.275 --> 03:01.793
I've got great news.

03:01.896 --> 03:05.724
There's going to be a war.

03:05.827 --> 03:08.172
- Oh. It's a war.

03:09.310 --> 03:11.241
What a relief.

03:11.344 --> 03:13.448
- The CIA is backing
a military coup

03:13.551 --> 03:15.172
to overthrow
the Bolivian president.

03:15.275 --> 03:16.620
And we have the chance
to pitch ourselves

03:16.724 --> 03:19.586
as the exclusive weapons
supplier.

03:19.689 --> 03:22.448
Hampton DeVille has never landed
a full-scale war before--

03:22.551 --> 03:24.931
well, unless you count
the Falkland Islands.

03:25.034 --> 03:25.931
But who does?

03:28.448 --> 03:31.379
- Wow. 10:00 a.m. Monday morning
and there's already a war.

03:31.482 --> 03:33.172
I was really hoping
to ease into this week.

03:33.275 --> 03:34.965
- Wars are good.
They create jobs,

03:35.068 --> 03:37.241
prevent overpopulation, and
benefit the rich and powerful,

03:37.344 --> 03:38.413
which I plan to be one day.

03:40.034 --> 03:41.137
- Did you just report somebody?

03:41.241 --> 03:42.793
- That guy took his shoes off
in a meeting.

03:42.896 --> 03:44.517
Who does that?

03:44.620 --> 03:46.344
- Why would you get someone
in trouble for that?

03:46.448 --> 03:48.724
- That guy is a racist.
- He is?

03:48.827 --> 03:52.517
- I mean, he's a white guy
over the age of 50, so probably.

03:52.620 --> 03:54.655
- Do you think we'll be racist
when we're 50?

03:54.758 --> 03:56.586
- Of course.

03:56.689 --> 03:59.379
- Wow.
That's a tough one to swallow.

03:59.482 --> 04:02.310
- I'm still haunted
by the Iraq war.

04:02.413 --> 04:04.241
Stockheed Barton stole
that contract

04:04.344 --> 04:06.068
right out from
underneath of us.

04:06.172 --> 04:09.137
And for 15 years, I've had to
watch the Middle East

04:09.241 --> 04:12.275
be destabilized
by another man's bombs.

04:12.379 --> 04:16.172
But this is our chance
for redemption.

04:16.275 --> 04:19.551
Now I've already written
a proposal.

04:19.655 --> 04:23.689
All I need is for someone
to turn it into a PowerPoint.

04:23.793 --> 04:25.448
- I'm actually really good
at PowerPoints.

04:25.551 --> 04:27.172
- Here's my impression
of a lost person.

04:27.275 --> 04:29.000
"I'm actually really good
at PowerPoint."

04:29.103 --> 04:30.241
- You're damaging
my self-esteem.

04:30.344 --> 04:32.482
- Good.
- Which one of you

04:32.586 --> 04:34.586
will rise to the challenge?

04:37.620 --> 04:39.275
- What are you doing?
- You don't get it.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.413
In high school,
I was thePowerPoint guy.

04:41.517 --> 04:43.655
Everyone would look forward
to my PowerPoints.

04:43.758 --> 04:46.172
- Anybody?

04:46.275 --> 04:48.793
Oh, come on, people.

04:56.655 --> 04:59.206
Are you PowerPoint proficient?

04:59.310 --> 05:00.482
- I'm more than proficient.

05:00.586 --> 05:02.655
I listed it as a special skill
on my resume

05:02.758 --> 05:04.965
right next to Microsoft Word
and clarinet.

05:06.103 --> 05:07.448
- Okay.

05:07.551 --> 05:10.275
I'm putting my trust in you.

05:10.379 --> 05:12.344
Don't let me down.

05:12.448 --> 05:13.862
- Yes, sir.

05:16.827 --> 05:19.448
- I am going to crush
this PowerPoint.

05:19.551 --> 05:21.068
In 11th grade,
I did a PowerPoint

05:21.172 --> 05:24.310
about the Triangle Shirtwaist
Factory that was so good

05:24.413 --> 05:26.172
a girl gave me
my first real hand job.

05:26.275 --> 05:28.413
- Look, Karen's picking
her nose.

05:28.517 --> 05:30.862
Big mistake, Karen.

05:30.965 --> 05:32.137
- This app is amazing.

05:32.241 --> 05:33.482
I spent so much time
at this company

05:33.586 --> 05:35.448
trying to build myself up,
when all along,

05:35.551 --> 05:37.793
I should've just been
tearing other people down.

05:37.896 --> 05:41.689
- Matt, it was so brave of you
to volunteer in there.

05:41.793 --> 05:45.103
Like a Kamikaze pilot
that wasn't asked to fly.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.172
- Everything you need
is on this.

05:48.655 --> 05:49.827
- Oh, and Matt, please stop

05:49.931 --> 05:52.862
throwing away bananas
in the break room.

06:02.068 --> 06:04.103

06:56.620 --> 06:57.793

I realized

06:57.896 --> 06:59.586
I wasn't making
conscious decisions.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.482
The font choices were
just flowing out of me,

07:01.586 --> 07:03.620
and, uh,
I wasn't even controlling it.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.793
- Matt, we've been looking
for you.

07:04.896 --> 07:06.103
- We just reviewed
your PowerPoint.

07:06.206 --> 07:08.137
- Okay, keep in mind
it was a first draft,

07:08.241 --> 07:09.827
and I'm open to any changes.

07:09.931 --> 07:11.310
- We loved it.

07:11.413 --> 07:13.137
- Your PowerPoint is art.

07:13.241 --> 07:16.517
Your decision to use bullets
as bullet points...

07:16.620 --> 07:18.517
- Genius.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.965
Oh, I'm so glad.

07:20.068 --> 07:22.034
I mean, it felt right, you know?
But you never know.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.172
- We're going to lunch
with Christian and we want you

07:24.275 --> 07:25.655
to be there
to present your work.

07:25.758 --> 07:29.448
- Oh, yeah, I--I love lunch,
so that totally works on my end.

07:29.551 --> 07:31.206
- And Jake,
you need to go to HR.

07:31.310 --> 07:34.758
- Somebody reported you
for abusing the HD-Whistle app.

07:36.655 --> 07:38.586
You can't report us
for telling you that.

07:40.896 --> 07:42.931
- You just told them
you love lunch.

07:43.034 --> 07:44.586
- I do love lunch.

07:47.862 --> 07:49.551
- Yes, I'll have
the lobster roulade

07:49.655 --> 07:53.137
and a bottle of Chateau Montrose
for the table.

07:53.241 --> 07:54.310
- And for you, sir?

07:54.413 --> 07:58.620
- Um, I'll have the...

07:58.724 --> 08:00.344
Sheep labia?
- Excellent choice.

08:00.448 --> 08:02.862
- You're gonna love that.
- It tastes just like chicken.

08:02.965 --> 08:05.379
Except it's the genitals
of another animal.

08:05.482 --> 08:08.000
- So...

08:08.103 --> 08:12.379
Let's see this PowerPoint
everyone is raving about.

08:15.551 --> 08:17.517
- Who blew the whistle on me,
Grace?

08:17.620 --> 08:20.310
Who's the rat?
Tell me.

08:20.413 --> 08:22.275
Tell me! Tell me.

08:22.379 --> 08:24.931
- Telling you would violate
my oath as an administrator

08:25.034 --> 08:29.413
of Human Resources,
and I would never do that

08:29.517 --> 08:31.379
For less than $20.

08:35.586 --> 08:38.448
- There. Now who was it?

08:38.551 --> 08:40.862
- It was me.
- Grace, why?

08:40.965 --> 08:42.965
- Because you're creating
a ton of work for me.

08:43.068 --> 08:45.344
You blew the whistle
on 23 people yesterday.

08:45.448 --> 08:48.000
- Well, I'm sorry for exposing
the truth like Edward Snowden.

08:48.103 --> 08:50.931
- Please, you're nothing
like Edward Snowden.

08:51.034 --> 08:53.310
You lack his bravery,
his integrity,

08:53.413 --> 08:55.137
his raw sexuality.

08:55.241 --> 08:57.344
- God, he's so hot.
- God, he's so hot.

08:57.448 --> 08:59.655
- I just wanna lick his glasses.
- Wanna hack into his mainframe.

08:59.758 --> 09:01.172
- I just wanna spoon him
in the cold, Russian night.

09:01.275 --> 09:05.413
- Anyway, this company does
reprehensible things every day.

09:05.517 --> 09:06.689
If you actually care,

09:06.793 --> 09:08.689
find a real problem
to blow the whistle on.

09:08.793 --> 09:11.344
- Okay but what if I don't
actually care?

09:11.448 --> 09:12.655
- As you can see,

09:12.758 --> 09:15.586
Hampton DeVille blows
the competition away.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.620
And star wipe...
The end.

09:19.724 --> 09:23.413
- God damn it.
Now that...

09:23.517 --> 09:25.172
is a PowerPoint.

09:25.275 --> 09:26.413
- Thank you.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.000
You know, I promised myself
I would crush this,

09:28.103 --> 09:30.793
and I did.
- And the bullet bullet points,

09:30.896 --> 09:33.724
brilliant.
Um...

09:33.827 --> 09:35.448
I'm sorry, remind me.
What's your name again?

09:35.551 --> 09:38.275
- Oh, shit.
Here comes Stockheed.

09:47.793 --> 09:50.827
- Christian, so nice to see you.

09:50.931 --> 09:54.793
- Been a long time, Arthur.
Surprised you're still alive.

09:54.896 --> 09:57.931
- Surprised you can afford
to eat here.

09:58.034 --> 09:59.034
What do you have there?

09:59.137 --> 10:00.827
- Oh, this is the sheep labia.

10:00.931 --> 10:03.724
- It's nothing.
Just a little PowerPoint.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.862
- Ah, top secret.

10:05.965 --> 10:09.034
I wonder if it's for the CIA.

10:10.241 --> 10:12.310
You know,
you're not the only company

10:12.413 --> 10:15.517
to pitch the Bolivia contract.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.310
- You may have won Iraq,

10:17.413 --> 10:20.310
but your prices are as bloated
as your prostate.

10:20.413 --> 10:21.655
You won't win Bolivia.

10:21.758 --> 10:24.965
- The CIA will never deal
with Hampton DeVille.

10:25.068 --> 10:29.448
Your products are not tested
on the battlefield.

10:29.551 --> 10:30.689
Nice font, kid.

10:30.793 --> 10:33.448
- Oh, thanks, I--
- Not.

10:33.551 --> 10:35.931
Not... Not... Not...

10:36.034 --> 10:40.103
Think I'll leave you
to your sheep labia.

10:42.827 --> 10:44.689
- This font is all wrong.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.965
This whole PowerPoint is a mess.
Goddamn it.

10:49.965 --> 10:52.827
- ♪ You're a loser

10:52.931 --> 10:55.724
♪ Because you lost the fight

10:55.827 --> 10:56.931
- As you can see,

10:57.034 --> 10:59.724
Hampton DeVille
blows the competition away.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.551
And star wipe...
The end.

11:02.655 --> 11:05.655
So what'd you think? Christian's
crazy not to use this, right?

11:05.758 --> 11:07.103
- Uh...
- Uh...

11:07.206 --> 11:09.068
- The only slide
I'm worried about is this one.

11:09.172 --> 11:10.620
I mostly used Helvetica New,

11:10.724 --> 11:12.137
but I tried mixing in
some Palatino

11:12.241 --> 11:13.724
just to get
some serifs in there.

11:13.827 --> 11:15.931
Does that work?
- Yeah.

11:16.034 --> 11:18.689
I think the fonts are fine.

11:18.793 --> 11:22.379
My big note is that this...

11:22.482 --> 11:24.724
is a war crime.
- I agree.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.827
And also, mixing those fonts
did not work for me.

11:26.931 --> 11:29.379
- You made a PowerPoint
that is evidence

11:29.482 --> 11:32.724
of the government colluding
with a corporation

11:32.827 --> 11:34.655
to start an illegal war.

11:34.758 --> 11:36.724
How could you do this?

11:36.827 --> 11:39.620
- Um, honestly, I was pretty
focused on the fonts.

11:39.724 --> 11:41.689
But now that
you're pointing it out, wow.

11:41.793 --> 11:44.689
Good note, Grace, and thank you
for the constructive criticism.

11:44.793 --> 11:45.965
- See, this is the type of thing

11:46.068 --> 11:47.620
that you should be
whistle-blowing.

11:47.724 --> 11:49.689
- That's a great idea.
We should leak this.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.068
The fallout would be huge.

11:51.172 --> 11:52.551
Top executives could get fired,

11:52.655 --> 11:54.137
and then we could fill
those spots.

11:54.241 --> 11:57.068
- Yeah it's great how stopping
a war would benefit you.

11:57.172 --> 11:58.862
- Exactly, Grace.
Matt, who do we know

11:58.965 --> 12:01.965
who could anonymously leak this?
Matt? Matt?

12:02.068 --> 12:04.551
- Oh, sorry, I was just thinking
about fonts again.

12:06.103 --> 12:08.448
- Okay, so we're
in a parking garage.

12:08.551 --> 12:09.758
Why'd you bring me here?

12:09.862 --> 12:11.379
- Well, we know
that you're into, like,

12:11.482 --> 12:15.448
the Internet and stuff, and,
um, we were just wondering...

12:15.551 --> 12:18.689
Are you in Anonymous?

12:18.793 --> 12:20.275
- Before I answer that question,

12:20.379 --> 12:22.896
I'm gonna need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

12:30.758 --> 12:32.310
- Satisfied?

12:36.551 --> 12:38.517
- Just taking my clothes off
in a parking garage.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.758
Good.
- See? No wire.

12:40.862 --> 12:42.862
Just two perfectly
average-sized dicks.

12:44.896 --> 12:47.172
- Blackmail.
All right.

12:47.275 --> 12:49.137
- So you are in Anonymous,
right?

12:49.241 --> 12:51.137
- Of course I'm in Anonymous,
everybody knows that.

12:51.241 --> 12:52.724
- Okay, well, hypothetically,

12:52.827 --> 12:54.275
if we had some
sensitive documents

12:54.379 --> 12:57.034
involving
Hampton DeVille and the CIA,

12:57.137 --> 12:59.448
could you help us leak those?

12:59.551 --> 13:01.931
- That is within my powers, yes.

13:02.034 --> 13:03.275
- Everything you need is
on this,

13:03.379 --> 13:05.103
including a very exceptional
PowerPoint

13:05.206 --> 13:06.275
that I worked very hard on

13:06.379 --> 13:08.241
that you will want
to feature prominently.

13:09.965 --> 13:11.586
- Okay, I'll check it out.

13:11.689 --> 13:14.068
If it's all good, I'll release
it tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

13:14.172 --> 13:16.000
- Why 11:00 a.m.?
- By 11:00 a.m.,

13:16.103 --> 13:17.896
everyone's at work, bored,
surfing the Internet,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.586
looking for something
to be outraged about.

13:20.689 --> 13:22.000
- Someone's coming!

13:23.793 --> 13:26.379
- That's my car.

13:26.482 --> 13:29.275
- Sorry, just having
a secret meeting.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.965
- No, no, no, this is all wrong.

13:35.068 --> 13:36.655
Try Marker Felt.

13:38.965 --> 13:41.448
Oh, looks terrible.
Okay, um...

13:41.551 --> 13:43.103
Do Bookman Old Style.

13:43.206 --> 13:45.931
- Old style?
- Old style.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.689
No, too old.
- Too old.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.172
- Ancient.
- It's ancient.

13:49.275 --> 13:51.620
- Papyrus.
- Delicious.

13:51.724 --> 13:54.965
- Oh, God, no.
Try...Wingdings.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.034
- A classic.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.000
- Oh, no, wait,
we already tried this one.

13:59.103 --> 14:01.965
- Oh, Jesus.
- Christian.

14:02.068 --> 14:03.655
I don't think
the font is the problem.

14:03.758 --> 14:06.241
Stockheed was just trying
to get into your head.

14:06.344 --> 14:09.517
It was psychological warfare.
- Fair enough.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.655
But Stockheed is right about
our products being untested.

14:12.758 --> 14:14.931
No, if we want to start a war,

14:15.034 --> 14:17.482
we're going to need
more than a PowerPoint.

14:21.137 --> 14:23.758
We're going to need soldiers.

14:30.586 --> 14:33.310
- Okay, you ready
to change the world?

14:33.413 --> 14:35.413
- Yeah.

14:35.517 --> 14:37.068
- Okay, we did it.

14:37.172 --> 14:38.137
- And you're positive
they won't be able

14:38.241 --> 14:40.068
to trace this back to us?
- Not to you.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.275
But they'll definitely
trace it back to Jake.

14:42.379 --> 14:44.103
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

14:44.206 --> 14:45.655
They'll track
your computer's IP address.

14:45.758 --> 14:47.275
They're really fast
with that these days.

14:47.379 --> 14:48.620
You're gonna want
to leave the country.

14:48.724 --> 14:50.137
There's a ticket
to the Ukraine waiting for you

14:50.241 --> 14:53.724
at the airport
under the name Ralph Schnader.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.413
You can reimburse me
on Bitcoin.

14:55.517 --> 14:56.862
Good luck.

15:00.034 --> 15:01.551
- Matt, there's so many things

15:01.655 --> 15:03.862
I never got the chance
to say to you,

15:03.965 --> 15:05.758
but they're pretty mean,
so I won't.

15:05.862 --> 15:07.758
Feed my cat.

15:07.862 --> 15:10.310
- Hey, Matt, great news.
Christian changed his mind.

15:10.413 --> 15:11.758
He wants to use
your PowerPoint.

15:11.862 --> 15:13.758
- We're all about to leave
for the CIA Blacksite,

15:13.862 --> 15:14.931
so grab your
stuff, let's go.

15:15.034 --> 15:16.379
- Have fun at the pitch.
See you guys later.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.310
- Actually, Jake, Christian
wants you at the meeting too.

15:19.413 --> 15:20.724
- Christian wants me
at the meeting?

15:20.827 --> 15:23.448
- He asked for you both
by physical description.

15:23.551 --> 15:26.344
- Two white guys with no other
discernible features.

15:29.241 --> 15:33.034
- So you want to go to war.

15:33.137 --> 15:36.724
But you don't want it to cost
an arm and a leg.

15:43.379 --> 15:45.413
This is Hampton DeVille.

15:48.413 --> 15:51.344
Those competitors that say
size doesn't matter?

15:51.448 --> 15:53.172
It does.

15:53.275 --> 15:56.241
Cost-effective carnage.
What more needs to be said?

16:00.172 --> 16:02.448
Creatively evading
the Geneva Convention.

16:02.551 --> 16:06.068
Who wants to worry about
all those persnickety laws?

16:06.172 --> 16:08.758
All you need to remember
is we are the good guys,

16:08.862 --> 16:11.137
and you get to win.

16:11.241 --> 16:13.482
First, I just want to say
you guys all look great.

16:13.586 --> 16:15.241
Black is such a slimming color.

16:15.344 --> 16:17.172
You look so handsome
and beautiful.

16:17.275 --> 16:20.241
- You get twice the destruction
at half the price.

16:20.344 --> 16:23.241
- And we will match
any competitor's blast radius.

16:23.344 --> 16:25.862
That is a Hampton DeVille
guarantee.

16:29.137 --> 16:31.034
- And as you can see,

16:31.137 --> 16:34.896
Hampton DeVille
blows the competition away.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.896
And star wipe.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.206
The end.

16:43.448 --> 16:45.586
- I loved the bullet
bullet points.

16:45.689 --> 16:48.068
- Before we finish,
I'd like to invite up

16:48.172 --> 16:50.655
two of Hampton DeVille's
most valued employees.

16:59.206 --> 17:02.206
This is Tom.

17:02.310 --> 17:05.413
And this is Jerry.

17:05.517 --> 17:09.344
And we're going to do
a little demonstration for you.

17:09.448 --> 17:11.931
Why should you trust a company
whose weapons are completely

17:12.034 --> 17:13.931
untested on the battlefield?

17:14.034 --> 17:18.068
Because at Hampton DeVille,
we believe in our products.

17:18.172 --> 17:20.862
Now these vests use
half the Kevlar

17:20.965 --> 17:23.206
of normal bulletproof vests
which allows us

17:23.310 --> 17:26.896
to keep costs down
and pass the savings on to you.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.137
This is also an opportunity to
show off our HD200 sniper rifle

17:31.241 --> 17:33.517
with optional laser sights.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.965
We made the barrel 60% thinner
than our leading competitor.

17:37.068 --> 17:38.689
It dramatically reduces
the costs

17:38.793 --> 17:41.551
with only a minimal decrease
in accuracy.

17:41.655 --> 17:45.482
These men believe
in Hampton DeVille.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.344
And after this demonstration,
I know you will too.

17:49.448 --> 17:51.620
- Mr. DeVille, I don't think
this is necessary.

17:51.724 --> 17:53.172
- Ready...

17:53.275 --> 17:54.448
- They're gonna call our bluff,
right?

17:54.551 --> 17:56.068
- Christian promised they would,

17:56.172 --> 17:58.172
but God damn it,
I hope they don't.

17:58.275 --> 17:59.413
- Aim...

17:59.517 --> 18:00.931
- All right,
you've convinced us.

18:01.034 --> 18:02.896
- Which eye do you close?

18:15.896 --> 18:17.724
-  Honestly,
I can't help but feel

18:17.827 --> 18:18.931
that I deserve this.

18:19.034 --> 18:20.689
- I am so sorry.
I don't know how

18:20.793 --> 18:24.310
to turn off Facebook
notifications on this phone.

18:24.413 --> 18:26.103
Oh, good lord.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.068
Hampton DeVille
has been hacked!

18:29.172 --> 18:32.172
This entire PowerPoint
is on Facebook.

18:32.275 --> 18:34.137
- Ah, man, this sucks.

18:34.241 --> 18:37.172
Now everybody knows
about our secret war!

19:18.448 --> 19:20.793
- Oh, look, he's awake.

19:20.896 --> 19:23.206
I gotta get outta here.
They're gonna be coming for me.

19:23.310 --> 19:25.758
- No, Jake, I hid
your IP address.

19:25.862 --> 19:27.241
They'll never be able
to trace this back to you.

19:27.344 --> 19:28.758
- Then why did you tell me
they would?

19:28.862 --> 19:30.655
- Because you reported me
on HD-Whistle,

19:30.758 --> 19:32.137
you power hungry psycho weasel.

19:32.241 --> 19:33.586
- How did you find out?

19:33.689 --> 19:35.413
- Just paid Grace 10 bucks.

19:35.517 --> 19:38.482
- You made me pay 20.
- Learn to negotiate.

19:38.586 --> 19:40.068
- You two better watch
what you say.

19:40.172 --> 19:42.827
Because if anyone ever connects
this leak back to me,

19:42.931 --> 19:43.965
you're going viral.

19:44.068 --> 19:45.931
Wow, if you put
the two of those together,

19:46.034 --> 19:47.551
they'd make one great dick.

19:47.655 --> 19:49.620
- The good news is
that because of the leak,

19:49.724 --> 19:53.000
there's no way the CIA is gonna
go through with the war.

19:53.103 --> 19:56.965
- Great news. There's going to
be several wars.

19:57.068 --> 19:59.724
- Countries who thought they
couldn't afford to go to war

19:59.827 --> 20:03.137
saw our PowerPoint
and now realize they can.

20:03.241 --> 20:07.206
- Huh. So I prevented a war
but caused multiple wars?

20:07.310 --> 20:10.413
- Yeah, but it seems like a lot
of people liked your PowerPoint.

20:10.517 --> 20:12.655
And those people are terrorists.

20:12.758 --> 20:15.344
- And the best part is, because
the CIA called off the coup,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.896
we cockblocked
those Stockheed assholes.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.655
This is a big win for everyone
at Hampton DeVille.

20:20.758 --> 20:23.034
But I will never forget
the names of the people

20:23.137 --> 20:24.724
who helped me the most.

20:27.034 --> 20:29.379
Anonymous.

21:10.931 --> 21:12.206
- Garamond Bold.

21:12.310 --> 21:15.551
- I love a good Garamond.
- Damn it, that looks terrible.

21:15.655 --> 21:18.793
No, okay, um...
Calibri.

21:18.896 --> 21:21.689
- Ah, very nice.
- No. No, no, no, no.

21:21.793 --> 21:24.586
- Sucks.
- Century Gothic Bold.
