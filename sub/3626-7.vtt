00:02.306 --> 00:03.960
[female narrator]
Gossip girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.047 --> 00:05.135
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.963
Gossip girl was right.
I'm gay.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.747
Every time mom brought
home someone who said

00:08.834 --> 00:10.053
"I love you"
they would end up married.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.272
I'm not ashamed
of who I am.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.577
I may have concealed
things in the past

00:12.664 --> 00:14.014
but not anymore.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.711
The bad news is that
your girlfriend Catherine

00:15.798 --> 00:18.279
is a lying, manipulating whore
who's sleeping with her stepson.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.281
The good news is I convinced
them both to leave town.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.587
What do you care about humdrum
Humphrey anyway? He's nothing.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.067
I actually think
he's pretty cool.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.590
The only person
with fewer friends

00:25.677 --> 00:27.288
than you is Dan Humphrey.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.550
'And that's because he's
something you'll never be'

00:28.637 --> 00:30.030
'a human being.'

00:31.770 --> 00:33.163
Where has she been Serena?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.643
And who am I?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.558
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.778
You know you love me.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.607
X-O-X-O, Gossip Girl.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.308
There's nothing quite
like autumn in New York.

00:47.395 --> 00:50.137
But it's not only
the leaves that change.

00:50.224 --> 00:53.488
Something in the air brings out
the true colors in everyone.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.057
Why are you all so quiet?

00:57.144 --> 00:58.580
Good morning.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.236
Bart, you're back early.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.194
My last round of meetings
wrapped up sooner than expected.

01:04.281 --> 01:07.241
Rushing home to the family.
How long's this layover?

01:07.328 --> 01:10.157
Didn't Lily tell you?
I'm here for the long haul.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.855
And for our housewarming
party tomorrow night.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.857
Um, I've been
meaning to ask you.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.251
- Uh, can we bring friends?
- Of course, dear.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.818
Oh, um, did you
get the little suit

01:19.905 --> 01:21.603
that I laid out
for you Serena?

01:21.690 --> 01:23.126
That was for me?

01:23.213 --> 01:25.737
I thought the housekeepers
got new uniforms.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.523
Yeah, it's conservative,
yes, but classic.

01:28.610 --> 01:29.872
Bart brought it from Paris.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.613
It had its own seat
on his plane.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.398
- Bart bought me a suit?
- New watch.

01:34.485 --> 01:37.184
Cash, direct deposit into
one of my offshore accounts.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.797
Now that we are all here

01:41.884 --> 01:43.625
Lily and I have something
we want to discuss.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.323
As tomorrow's party marks
our debut as a family

01:46.410 --> 01:49.326
we've been talking about
what that actually means.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.894
Less money for me
when you die?

01:51.981 --> 01:53.983
We were thinking more along
the lines of some guidelines.

01:54.070 --> 01:57.682
- G-guidelines? For what?
- 'For life together.'

01:57.769 --> 01:59.815
I mean, now that
we're all here.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.295
Having some rules
would be nice.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.687
Like what?

02:02.774 --> 02:04.733
Like every Friday,
we dine as a family.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.951
Uh, don't you think
Monday would be--

02:06.038 --> 02:07.605
A weekend curfew of 1:00 A.M.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.433
Is that Eastern or Pacific?

02:09.520 --> 02:10.565
And no going out
on school nights.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.044
- What?
- Are you serious?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.221
- Alright.
- Where's this coming from?

02:14.308 --> 02:15.961
Bart and me.
We made the decision together.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.138
We are in complete
agreement on this matter.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.488
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.013
[sighs]

02:29.453 --> 02:32.456
Medicine cabinet,
bedside table, underwear drawer?

02:32.543 --> 02:35.111
It's borderline solicitation,
V, and, uh, creepy.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.982
It wouldn't be creepy if you'd
actually read the flyer.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.420
You're want to save Dutch
Schultz's favorite speakeasy.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.204
But what are you protesting?
The-the owner died, didn't he?

02:41.291 --> 02:43.467
He did, which is why the whole
building's up for auction.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.904
And if we don't stop the sale,
it won't be long before

02:45.991 --> 02:48.690
some evil developer turns
it into Le Pain Quotidien.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.213
Oh, I like Le Pain--

02:50.300 --> 02:52.215
We're doing a petition
for landmark status..

02:52.302 --> 02:53.999
Uh, which you signed

02:54.086 --> 02:56.654
and dad signed and mom signed

02:56.741 --> 02:59.179
and, and Eleanor Waldorf.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.267
How about I come to school
with you and hand out

03:00.354 --> 03:01.659
flyers to the guilty rich?

03:01.746 --> 03:02.791
Well, if there is such
a thing, I'd-I don't

03:02.878 --> 03:04.314
think there's any
in my school.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.533
Well, maybe one
of their mommies or daddies

03:05.620 --> 03:08.100
is looking
for their next cause.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.278
Whose bag is that?
That's a soccer ball.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.541
Oh, yeah, apparently, half
the soccer team at St. Jude's

03:13.628 --> 03:15.325
got mono from making out
with Lauren Goldenberg.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.371
So I-I guess
their only other

03:17.458 --> 03:19.416
option was to ask me
to try out.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.157
Wait.
They asked you?

03:21.244 --> 03:23.246
[laughing]

03:23.333 --> 03:25.640
Yeah, well, Nate did.
I'm now an alternate.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.729
I'm also really,
really late.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.426
Uh, you with me?

03:29.513 --> 03:30.427
Yeah.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.736
Well, uh, good luck
with the guiltless rich.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.912
What's next, no TV until after
you finish your homework?

03:36.999 --> 03:38.653
They're just
a few rules, Serena.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.698
Who watches TV
on a TV anymore anyway?

03:40.785 --> 03:43.179
It's not about the rules, Eric.
It's about mom.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.789
When it's just
the three of us, it's fine.

03:44.876 --> 03:47.357
But anytime she gets
a new guy, she Stepford's out

03:47.444 --> 03:48.576
and lets him
make all the decisions.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.230
I don't think
that's what's happening.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.883
Remember when we had
to move to Chamonix

03:51.970 --> 03:54.364
because German Klaus
wanted to ski all year round?

03:54.451 --> 03:55.713
That wasn't so bad.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.019
Oh, what about Paolo

03:57.106 --> 03:59.456
the raw-food diet,
family colonics?

03:59.543 --> 04:02.198
Or Sameer? I know I enjoyed
our brief conversion to Islam.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.113
- I see what you mean.
- Look..

04:04.200 --> 04:06.463
Mom can't let these guys
choose her life for her

04:06.550 --> 04:07.725
but they shouldn't
be able to choose ours.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.684
It seems different
this time.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.338
She seems pretty
serious about making

04:11.425 --> 04:12.991
the whole family
thing work with Bart.

04:13.078 --> 04:16.430
- We could at least try, right?
- Fine.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.040
But the second he starts
to call the shots

04:18.127 --> 04:20.434
these gloves come off
and the nails come out.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.087
I just mixed metaphors,
didn't I?

04:22.174 --> 04:23.828
Yeah, but it kind of worked.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.051
And the coach is really
impressed with your tryouts.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.749
- Really?
- Yeah. Thanks for subbing in.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.230
Well, save your thanks
untilafteryou see me play.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.232
- 'It's gonna be--'
- Humphrey, never a pleasure.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.973
Oh, good.
We agree on something.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.150
Archibald, isn't it about time
you ended this bromance?

04:41.237 --> 04:43.370
What happens at Yale
stays at Yale.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.762
Hey, man.
Let's go.

04:47.678 --> 04:50.942
Poor Chuck. What is life
without a friend to share it?

04:51.029 --> 04:54.163
Oh, it looks like you just
lost yours to Dan Humphrey.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.906
Who cares? I'd rather talk about
who you lost yours to anyway..

04:57.993 --> 05:00.735
Uh-uh.
Been there, done that.

05:00.822 --> 05:01.997
Been decontaminated.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.520
We both know
you'll do it again.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.000
It's just a question
of when.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.219
The answer is never.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.700
We're inevitable, Waldorf.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.963
Despite whatever
vestigial attraction

05:12.050 --> 05:15.097
my body may feel for you,
my brain knows better.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.142
And yours should, too.
I gotta go.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.927
I've got a
disciplinary hearing.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.495
Well, I knew you were trouble,
but a hearing? Impressive.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.453
Oh, it's not for me.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.764
Kelsey, Kelsey, Kelsey,
how many times must we tell you?

05:29.851 --> 05:31.461
'As one of the girls
of the steps'

05:31.548 --> 05:33.768
you represent
Constance royalty.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.031
So it should come
as no surprise

05:36.118 --> 05:38.512
that many girls before
you have gotten the ax

05:38.599 --> 05:40.862
when their choices
reflected poorly on us.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.386
- I didn't realize.
- That tights are not pants?

05:43.473 --> 05:46.520
- 'Honestly.'
- Blair, you got a minute?

05:46.607 --> 05:48.173
Sixty seconds.
Clock it.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.958
What are you doing
here with those?

05:50.045 --> 05:51.655
Shouldn't you be
at whole foods?

05:51.742 --> 05:53.788
As much as I hate these words
coming out of my mouth

05:53.875 --> 05:55.442
I could really use
your help with this.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.096
Oh, saving a teardown.

05:58.183 --> 06:01.056
Charity is for diseases
and endangered species.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.319
Real estate is not on the list,
at least not in New York.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.149
I can make you
help me, you know?

06:07.236 --> 06:08.977
Oh, makes jokes, too.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.892
Everyone knows that
you and Marcus broke up

06:10.979 --> 06:12.415
but no one knows why.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.899
Even you wouldn't
stoop that low.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.988
Blackmail seems to work
so well for you

06:20.075 --> 06:21.598
so maybe I'm missing out.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.253
Now that we've established
that I own you

06:24.340 --> 06:27.169
you have six hours to get
a thousand signatures

06:27.256 --> 06:29.214
and make sure
they're legible.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.477
Have fun.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.396
[instrumental music]

06:41.401 --> 06:43.228
Well, well, look who's
playing by the rules

06:43.315 --> 06:44.491
and it's not even
a school night.

06:44.578 --> 06:48.146
Eric convinced me.
What about you?

06:48.233 --> 06:50.105
I'm on my way
out to a house call.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.499
Ugh. Gross.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.240
Well, as long
as you're home by 1:00.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.199
Naive Serena.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.853
Don't you know,
Bart and Lil's

06:58.940 --> 07:00.942
list of rules
doesn't apply to me?

07:01.029 --> 07:02.117
What are you talking about?

07:02.204 --> 07:03.597
According to my sources

07:03.684 --> 07:06.382
the real reason my father
flew back early

07:06.469 --> 07:09.385
is to court some executives
in town from the Midwest.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.953
The only problem is,
they won't do business

07:12.040 --> 07:15.130
with anyone who doesn't
share their family values

07:15.217 --> 07:18.916
so Bart is making sure
we do...or appear to.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.789
Wait. All this, just so
he can close a deal?

07:23.181 --> 07:25.836
I do my best work
off the radar.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.142
But while
you're on"Page six"

07:27.229 --> 07:28.709
with the Poppy Liftons
of the world

07:28.796 --> 07:30.885
'you're the bigger threat
to Bart's business.'

07:32.669 --> 07:34.366
Goodnight, sis.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.325
I hope your book
is captivating.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.462
[elevator bell dings]

07:46.857 --> 07:49.381
[instrumental music]

07:50.470 --> 07:51.688
Hi, Bart.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.473
We missed
you at family dinner.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.126
Maybe next time.

07:55.213 --> 07:58.434
Where do you think you're
going and in that dress?

07:58.521 --> 08:01.350
Oh, the girls and I thought
we'd hit up One-Oak

08:01.437 --> 08:03.395
then maybe Bijoux
and I don't know

08:03.483 --> 08:05.528
anywhere we can
find some paparazzi.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.225
I'm in the mood
for a little show tonight.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.017
Oh, I forgot
to put on underwear.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.629
[elevator bell dings]

08:23.981 --> 08:25.548
Waving a white flag,
are we?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.419
Not exactly.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.380
- I have a proposition for you.
- I'll say yes.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.122
That little troll Vanessa
is working my last nerve.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.515
Not what I expected.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.690
And then I realized

08:36.777 --> 08:38.213
this could benefit both of us.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.867
You had me until "Troll."

08:39.954 --> 08:43.610
Dan stole your best friend.
Now you can steal his.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.960
Seduce and destroy.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.789
- What's in it for me?
- The thrill of the impossible.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.530
The only person
Vanessa loathes

08:50.617 --> 08:52.444
more than me is you.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.057
It would be one
for the ages.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.107
Maybe you're not
up for it.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.981
If memory serves, you've had
some mechanical problems.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.247
I'll just imagine
she's you.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.903
This just in.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.427
Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass

09:18.514 --> 09:22.213
placing a wager on the takedown
of lonely boy's BFF.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.263
We think we've heard
this story before

09:28.350 --> 09:31.788
and we're pretty sure
it ended up with everyone dead.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.363
[instrumental music]

09:44.148 --> 09:45.410
So what did Lily have to say

09:45.497 --> 09:47.108
about last night's
curfew flaunting?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.501
Mmm, I kind of snuck out
before she could corner me.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.200
Let them discipline the sibling
that actually deserves it.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.984
You mean Chuck?

09:56.204 --> 09:57.205
What ?

09:57.292 --> 09:59.337
- You smiled.
- No, I didn't.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.818
I hate Chuck.
Don't make me lose my appetite.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.124
Oh, hey, is that Eric?

10:05.082 --> 10:06.214
Hey, uh, Larissa
said you'd be here.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.433
Hey.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.870
And we are?
Who is this?

10:09.957 --> 10:11.654
Jonathan,
this is my sister, Serena

10:11.741 --> 10:13.830
'and her friend,
Blair Waldorf.'

10:13.917 --> 10:15.484
This is Jonathan,
my boyfriend.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.529
It's nice to meet you both.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.488
- Nice work, E.
- Oh, my gosh.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.055
Hi.
So nice to meet you.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.057
Sit down, both of you.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.362
I invited him
to the party tonight

10:24.449 --> 10:25.842
but I thought you should
meet him first.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.322
Yeah, I met Chuck
the other day.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.367
"Chuck?"
Wow, hear that, Blair?

10:30.412 --> 10:32.240
"Chuck."

10:32.327 --> 10:33.894
Ignore her.
She's dehydrated.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.157
- Did I miss something?
- No, but we did.

10:36.244 --> 10:40.596
The story of how you two met.
We wanna know everything.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.642
So then, the ball came to me
and so I kicked it to this guy

10:42.729 --> 10:44.382
and then, you know
he kicked it to another guy

10:44.469 --> 10:45.514
an he kicked it
to another guy

10:45.601 --> 10:46.558
And that guy scored.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.169
So, it was basically
an assist.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.736
- Wow.
- Yeah, it was awesome.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.085
It was pretty amazing.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.913
Oh, it's so weird that
you're on a team now.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.741
I mean, pretty soon you're
gonna have actual guy friends.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.352
What are you talking about?
I have plenty of guy friends.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.833
Dan, I know that
you're Mr. Soccer now

10:59.920 --> 11:01.878
but you and I both know you
prefer to hang out with girls.

11:03.227 --> 11:06.056
Vanessa, Serena,
once upon a time.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.405
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.494
- That's completely untrue.
- Okay.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.975
Dad, will you please tell Jenny
that-that I have guy friends?

11:12.062 --> 11:14.456
- Of course, he does. I'm his--
- No, not including you.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.111
- Or Cedric?
- Not including dolls.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.634
Okay, watch and learn.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.551
Nate. Hey, man.
Hey, it's Humphrey.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.596
Dan. Yeah, good. Good.
Hey, listen.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.296
Uh, you want to hook up
for some soccer later?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.167
You're-you're,
you're by the park, right?

11:30.254 --> 11:32.256
Noon, yeah.
Sweet, bro.

11:32.343 --> 11:35.738
Alright.
I love it. Bye.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.306
Apparently, uh, we're gonna
play soccer later.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.916
- Uh-huh.
- No big.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.657
- Is Cedric invited?
- Jenny.

11:41.744 --> 11:42.789
- Hmm.
- Come on.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.051
Thank you, dad.

11:44.138 --> 11:47.968
You know, Cedric
would get dirty.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.666
'And then Dan would
have to bathe him.'

11:50.753 --> 11:53.713
Alright, I'll see
you two later.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.410
I got my boy
waiting for me.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.805
[indistinct chattering]

12:00.415 --> 12:03.374
Great turnout, V.
I got a good feeling.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.681
Let's hope so, Horace.

12:05.768 --> 12:06.987
Here come the sharks.

12:16.779 --> 12:19.347
- What the hell are you doing?
- You mean you have to ask?

12:19.434 --> 12:21.436
I'm here because of you.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.524
Thank you for
introducing me to this

12:22.611 --> 12:24.395
unique business opportunity.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.223
No, uh-uh, you are not
buying this place to turn

12:26.310 --> 12:28.182
it into another
yuppie fusion bar.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.619
For your information,
since I bought Victrola

12:30.706 --> 12:34.057
Bass Industries has expanded
into vintage entertainment.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.711
We're willing
to work with you.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.409
Thanks, but we're already
petitioning for landmark status.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.107
Why don't you have a bake
sale while you're at it?

12:40.194 --> 12:41.978
In the real world,
we are your only hope.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.546
Endorse our bid and we promise
to return this place

12:44.633 --> 12:46.330
to all its sweet sordidness.

12:46.417 --> 12:50.073
It sounds perfect.
Just one problem.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.988
- I know you.
- Or do you only think you do?

12:52.075 --> 12:54.251
[male #1]
'Hey, get outta here,
rich boy!'

12:54.338 --> 12:55.731
[laughing]

12:55.818 --> 12:58.212
Wow, I didn't think that
suit could get any worse.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.300
I was wrong.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.739
[instrumental music]

13:12.574 --> 13:14.141
Oh, Serena, wait a minute.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.665
Would you excuse us, please?
Thank you.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.885
- So what's my punishment?
- Don't be childish.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.234
Why not?
You're treating me like one.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.844
Isn't that who
curfews are for?

13:21.931 --> 13:24.325
You're certainly living
up to our expectations.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.544
Bart told me you were looking
like a stripper last night.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.591
If you have a problem with our
rules then just say so.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.115
- But to simply defy us..
- Not you, him.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.291
Bart and I are
husband and wife.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.771
But he's not our father.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.819
Come on, mom.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.082
Things were
so good last year.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.084
We were almost
like a real family.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.955
Why change that?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.739
Serena, you're making
this much more

13:47.827 --> 13:49.176
complicated
than it really is.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.743
And going by your
actions last night

13:51.831 --> 13:54.834
I clearly think that you could
benefit from a little structure.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.706
If I thought this was actually
you talking, I might listen.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.664
If this is how
you're acting now

13:59.751 --> 14:01.884
I should have insisted
on more structure years ago.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.060
You mean, like,
three husbands ago?

14:08.499 --> 14:10.806
That was unkind.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.939
I'm not really
in a family mood.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.723
I think I'm gonna pass
on tonight's little soiree.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.601
[sparrow chirping]

14:34.612 --> 14:36.527
[dramatic music]

14:59.855 --> 15:01.161
Nate?

15:06.644 --> 15:08.385
[phone ringing]

15:14.043 --> 15:16.176
Hey, man.

15:16.263 --> 15:19.788
Oh, right, yeah, yeah,
we're meeting in the park. Yeah.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.921
No, no, no. I just,
I got, I got tied up.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.966
Yeah, I'll see you in ten.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.359
Okay.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.281
Whoever said,
"You can't have it all"

15:34.368 --> 15:37.153
must have known
the Archibalds.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.764
Looks like
poor little Nate is

15:39.851 --> 15:41.723
yuck...poor.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.033
[Dorota]
'A Mr. Chuck to see you,
Miss Blair.'

15:47.120 --> 15:49.731
Dorota, who?

15:49.818 --> 15:52.125
- Excuse me. Don't you--
- Deal's off.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.127
What?
What are you talking about?

15:54.214 --> 15:56.477
I'm out. I don't know
what I was thinking about.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.348
Pretending to buy
some broken-down bar.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.960
But you promised
to seduce Vanessa.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.657
- She needs to be destroyed.
- She's your problem.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.137
Humphrey doesn't
warrant this.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.616
The great Chuck Bass
is just gonna give up?

16:05.703 --> 16:07.053
No, no, no.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.751
There's no shame
if the prize isn't worth it.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.100
You can do your
own dirty work.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.449
There's not enough
in it for me.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.366
But what if I made
it worth it?

16:16.453 --> 16:18.455
What are you talking about?

16:18.542 --> 16:19.630
I think you know.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.024
You're not serious.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.637
My, my.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.162
That girlhas
gotten under your skin.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.729
The question is, Bass..

16:31.816 --> 16:34.167
...will you?

16:34.254 --> 16:37.039
Aren't you the least
bit worried

16:37.126 --> 16:38.084
I'll succeed?

16:43.524 --> 16:45.874
Do we have an agreement?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.528
Careful, B.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.313
One thing about making
a deal with the devil..

16:50.400 --> 16:52.098
Oh, we have a deal.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.276
He always comes to collect.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.805
After you left
your lawyer came back

17:03.892 --> 17:05.328
and showed us your proposal

17:05.415 --> 17:08.723
which did indeed include
keeping everything as is

17:08.810 --> 17:10.551
and lobbying
for landmark status.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.466
So I was telling the truth.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.163
I'm sure you've done
something in your lifetime

17:14.250 --> 17:16.426
to deserve getting
beaned by an iced beverage.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.213
Isn't it possible there are
parts of me you don't know?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.737
Possible, just
extremely unlikely.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.478
Did you have a reason
for coming here?

17:24.565 --> 17:25.609
'Cause if it
was to insult me

17:25.696 --> 17:27.655
there's a website
you can go to.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.222
The manager of the inn
wants to meet you.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.224
If he signs off,
you have our support.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.095
But it still doesn't
mean I trust you.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.228
Of course not.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.404
Now..

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
...I best go put on
something special.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.287
I don't know how she expects me
to take this family seriously

17:51.374 --> 17:53.246
when her record
stands at 16 months.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.813
- Which husband was that?
- Klaus.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.773
Is that the one who wore
the wooden shoes? Zip.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.645
No, that was Danish Claus,
with a "C."

18:01.732 --> 18:03.386
This is German Klaus,
with a "K."

18:03.473 --> 18:05.258
Wait, I forgot.
Did she marry both?

18:05.345 --> 18:07.956
No, just German Klaus but she
did date Danish Claus longer.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.349
[Blair]
'Oh, your mother.'

18:09.436 --> 18:11.307
Remember how she always
used to just jet off

18:11.394 --> 18:13.918
to Mustique or Ibiza
without warning

18:14.005 --> 18:15.311
while you and Eric
were still in school?

18:15.398 --> 18:16.921
Eleanor always
knew when we showed up

18:17.008 --> 18:18.271
with our overnight bags.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.924
Lily had a new boyfriend.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.926
We tried alternating between
you and the Archibalds

18:22.013 --> 18:23.885
so you guys never knew
how bad it really was.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.930
- We knew.
- 'But Bart is the worst.'

18:26.017 --> 18:28.019
He's controlling
anda hypocrite.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.673
He acts like
he's family friendly

18:29.760 --> 18:33.286
when he's dated half
the models in Manhattan.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.680
B, you look gorgeous.
Where did you get that dress?

18:36.767 --> 18:37.725
Oh, this?

18:37.812 --> 18:39.944
Just...Chuck.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.772
When did Chuck
give you a dress?

18:41.859 --> 18:44.645
- When we were going to Europe.
- And you're wearing it tonight?

18:44.732 --> 18:47.343
It's just that it would be
a shame to waste it, that's all.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.302
Uh-huh.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.868
[Dan]
'You know, you gotta
teach me that-that'

18:50.955 --> 18:52.522
'bouncing off the knees thing'

18:52.609 --> 18:54.133
'cause I tried it once,
but I broke my dad's Gibson.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.179
It's very scarring
to see your father cry.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.485
Well, I actually
wouldn't know.

18:58.572 --> 18:59.964
My father, not too big
on showing emotion.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.792
Mmm.

19:01.879 --> 19:04.752
I'm guessing you're not going to
the housewarming party, are you?

19:04.839 --> 19:08.234
No, no. Especially since this
is the first I'm hearing of it.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.671
Oh, so...you and Serena
are, like..

19:10.758 --> 19:12.542
Well, to say,
things ended badly

19:12.629 --> 19:15.850
would be an understatement.
You going?

19:15.937 --> 19:18.157
Uh, nah. I think I'm just
gonna stay at home

19:18.244 --> 19:19.636
chill out,
watch a movie, you know?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.464
Yeah, that sounds good.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.727
I'd actually invite you over
but the house is a total mess.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.251
Oh, yeah. No.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.688
- Housekeeper has the week off.
- Is your mom there?

19:27.775 --> 19:30.081
Not that she cleans things.
I-I, I don't know.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.172
- All that stuff with your dad..
- Yeah. No, it's..

19:33.259 --> 19:34.738
My mom's staying out
in the Hamptons..

19:34.825 --> 19:36.131
- Okay.
- So..

19:36.218 --> 19:38.351
I told her I was staying
at Chuck's just

19:38.438 --> 19:39.874
so she doesn't worry
about stuff, you know?

19:39.961 --> 19:41.528
I'm gonna get a drink, actually.
You want something?

19:41.615 --> 19:43.225

was a raging cokehead

29:21.411 --> 29:23.239
so he left blow everywhere.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.328
- Oh, my God.
- It wasn't everywhere.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.026
Just on the smooth,
shiny surfaces.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.636
Was that, um,
German Klaus with a "K"

29:28.723 --> 29:30.420
or Danish Claus
with a "C"?

29:30.507 --> 29:32.945
I can't ever remember which
ones she actually married

29:33.032 --> 29:34.555
or which she just decided
were more important

29:34.642 --> 29:36.078
than her children.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.648
You know what?
I was, I was wrong.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.216
It's not Bart at all.
It's you.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.348
Looks like the Bass
housewarming party

29:45.435 --> 29:47.307
just got a little colder.

29:47.394 --> 29:50.527
Serena's walk down memory lane
has her heading out the door.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.142
[instrumental music]

30:03.976 --> 30:05.020
Bet's off.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.241
But the game's not over.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.069
I'm calling it
on account of boredom.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.722
You were right. Vanessa's
not worth playing with.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.638
Maybe she is,
maybe she isn't.

30:14.725 --> 30:15.814
Why the sudden
change of heart?

30:15.901 --> 30:18.686
Like I said,
the whole thing is dull.

30:18.773 --> 30:22.298
Pursuing Vanessa
is beneath us both.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.909
You think I'm going
in for the kill.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.736
You're worried you're gonna
have to go through

30:25.824 --> 30:27.173
with what you promised.

30:27.260 --> 30:30.350
I'm not worried,
about...that.

30:30.437 --> 30:31.786
Well, then what?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.354
Then, nothing.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.009
Just...forget it.

30:43.493 --> 30:46.322
I can't believe Serena did
that in front of everyone

30:46.409 --> 30:48.455
that reporter,
all of these people.

30:48.542 --> 30:51.762
Eric, my darling,
you arealwayshonest with me.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.548
It isn't true, is it?

30:54.635 --> 30:58.117
I know Serena's
timing sucked

30:58.204 --> 31:00.249
but she did pretty much
raise me all those years.

31:01.642 --> 31:02.817
You just weren't here,
you know?

31:02.904 --> 31:04.384
I wasn'tthatbad.

31:04.471 --> 31:08.083
Our ringtone for you was
"Since You Been Gone."

31:08.170 --> 31:09.955
Vanya, the doorman,
used to sign our

31:10.042 --> 31:12.174
permission slips from school.

31:12.261 --> 31:15.177
Well, there was a lot
going on in my life.

31:15.264 --> 31:18.137
And I did the best I could,
just like I'm doing now.

31:18.224 --> 31:19.399
But now it's like
you want us to go

31:19.486 --> 31:22.228
from zero to Brady
in 60 seconds.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.665
We're not there yet.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.885
Oh, I know,
but I just thought if--

31:26.972 --> 31:30.497
You don't become a family
just by telling people you are.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.891
You become a family
because youwantto be one.

31:37.199 --> 31:40.724
I-mm. I think
mine's carbonated.

31:40.811 --> 31:41.900
Yours?

31:49.124 --> 31:50.734
You're still upset.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.823
Well, like I said, I tried to
help him and he bailed.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.260
So, you know,
if he doesn't want my help

31:54.347 --> 31:57.219
then that's-that's fine.

31:57.306 --> 32:00.396
And being a friend means giving
someone something they need

32:00.483 --> 32:02.181
even when they can't
ask for it, which you did.

32:02.268 --> 32:05.488
Right. I-I did that.
So..

32:05.575 --> 32:06.968
It also means not
giving up on them

32:07.055 --> 32:08.665
when they say
"No, thank you."

32:08.752 --> 32:09.928
I didn't do that,
and I'mnotdoing that.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.191
He wants to be alone.
Good luck to him.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.890
From what you told me,
this thing is pretty intense.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.718
I don't know if he has
anyone else in his life

32:17.805 --> 32:20.547
looking out
for him right now.

32:20.634 --> 32:23.028
You really wanna be his friend,
you need to be that person.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.292
I know I left my bag
with my coat.

32:26.379 --> 32:27.554
Could you just check again?

32:27.641 --> 32:29.860
No need.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.820
Don't tell me you took
my purse by mistake.

32:32.907 --> 32:36.693
Hardly. But then it wasn't
your bag I was after.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.348
Don't you know never to leave
anything valuable unattended?

32:39.435 --> 32:42.438
Oh, and I took the liberty of
increasing your storage space.

32:42.525 --> 32:43.657
What did you do?

32:43.744 --> 32:45.137
Marcus and Catherine
are free to live

32:45.224 --> 32:48.314
their sick little lives
in peace, as am I.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.490
Now that you have nothing on me,
you're done here.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.189
Except one more thing.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.800
You may think you've
discovered the hidden Chuck

32:56.887 --> 32:58.367
but you should know

32:58.454 --> 33:00.717
he has no real feelings
for you whatsoever.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.850
It was all a little
bet we made

33:02.937 --> 33:04.852
to see just how
gullible you could be.

33:07.159 --> 33:10.597
- I don't believe you.
- It was simple, really.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.904
Chuck wanted to get Dan,
and I wanted to get you.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.211
So are you telling me that
Chuck had his dad's company

33:16.298 --> 33:17.778
make an offer
on the Brooklyn inn

33:17.865 --> 33:19.519
in order to get back at Dan?

33:19.606 --> 33:22.217
Isn't that a little convoluted,
even for the two of you?

33:22.304 --> 33:24.176
Real estate
was just foreplay.

33:24.263 --> 33:27.048
Seducing and humiliating you
was the ultimate goal.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.485
Chuck didn't hit on me once.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.531
Maybe what's really going on
here is that you can't stand

33:31.618 --> 33:35.143
that he might actually be a good
person when he's not around you.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.362
I seriously doubt that.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.929
What are you doing, Blair?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.496
Tying up some loose ends.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.108
Telling Vanessa that she
doesn't mean anything to you.

33:43.195 --> 33:45.632
We were just playing chess
and she was another piece

33:45.719 --> 33:47.155
that you needed
to knock over

33:47.242 --> 33:49.114
on your way to
take the queen.

33:49.201 --> 33:54.119
Do you disagree?

33:54.206 --> 33:55.598
Guess I-I should've known.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.912
- Good boy.
- What was the point of that?

34:04.999 --> 34:06.131
Well, you may
not have seduced her

34:06.218 --> 34:08.046
but she seems
pretty humiliated to me.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.526
What are you saying?

34:10.613 --> 34:12.050
I'm saying..

34:12.137 --> 34:14.400
I lost, you won.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.358
I'll be waiting
in my room in one hour.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.187
Come claim your prize.

34:19.274 --> 34:21.146
Poor Chuck Bass.

34:21.233 --> 34:24.149
You made your bet.
Now you have to lie in it.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.377
[Serena]
'Dan, is that you?'

34:37.901 --> 34:40.687
- Are you talkin' to me?
- You're the only person here.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.820
Right, but that's, uh,
never stopped you before.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.170
I deserve that.

34:45.257 --> 34:46.519
I haven't started yet.

34:46.606 --> 34:49.217
Fine.
Sit, pile it on.

get any worse.

Falling for your line of bull.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.409
Talked to Vanessa already?

35:07.496 --> 35:09.107
Look, I know you have
no reason to trust me.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.978
And you ain't gonna be able
to give me one, either.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.284
So you might as well go.

35:12.371 --> 35:15.635
Look, I don't care
what you think about me.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.680
But I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna save this place.

Try saving yourself first, kid.

but I was wrong about you.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.746
So what are you doing
at Nate's anyway?

35:39.833 --> 35:41.617
Well, uh, Nate
and I are friends.

35:41.704 --> 35:45.186
At least, I hope we are.
What about you?

35:45.273 --> 35:47.536
I just had to get
out of my house

The only person I really
wanted to talk to

35:58.765 --> 36:01.420
I can't anymore.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.509
So I came here.

36:03.596 --> 36:07.469
- Pretend I'm Nate.
- What?

36:07.556 --> 36:09.297
Pretend I'm-well, look,
he pretended to be me

36:09.384 --> 36:11.125
so it's only fair.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.040
Really?

36:13.127 --> 36:15.695
Well, um..

36:15.782 --> 36:17.871
My mom hosted
this big party.

36:17.958 --> 36:20.830
It was supposed to be
about our new family.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.572
But it turns out, of course,
it was for publicity.

36:23.659 --> 36:26.271
So I-I blew up at her
in front of everyone.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.751
And this whole time

36:28.838 --> 36:30.797
I was thinking that
Bart was the problem.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.756
But I-I realized
it's all her.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.758
You ever think that your mom
acts like she's perfect

36:35.845 --> 36:37.673
because she's..

36:37.760 --> 36:40.110
...she's...too ashamed
to acknowledge

36:40.198 --> 36:41.938
how far from it
she's really been?

pretending to beNate.

- Hello, Daniel.

you home, Serena.

About the 17 years
that I wasn't here.

Eight letters.
Three syllables.

Say them, and I'm yours.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.457
But I'm already yours
and you're ruining

40:59.544 --> 41:00.675
the mood with all this talk.

41:00.762 --> 41:03.156
You can't say it.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.506
- You wanted it from me.
- I'm prepared to settle.

41:10.032 --> 41:12.600
Maybe I'm not.

I..

41:19.738 --> 41:21.827
will never say
those words to you.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.306
Then you will never have me.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.356
Is this because of Vanessa?

41:29.443 --> 41:31.706
'It was a game, Chuck.'

41:31.793 --> 41:33.534
That's it.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.754
Maybe I want
to raise the stakes.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.712
'Are you ready
to play that game?'

41:37.799 --> 41:41.281
I chased you for long enough.
