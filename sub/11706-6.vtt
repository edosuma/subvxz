27:10.503 --> 27:12.005
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN THE RELATIONSHIP,

27:12.088 --> 27:13.131
{\an8}AND IT'S NOT EVEN MINE.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.674
{\an8}- THIS IS SUCH A BAD TIME.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.426
{\an8}- I JUST CAN'T EVEN
TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.720
{\an8}JUST--IT'S ACTUALLY GIVING ME
A HEADACHE RIGHT NOW, FOR REAL.

27:18.803 --> 27:22.557
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.600
{\an8}- ROGER'S A GOOD TIME
THAT I DON'T WANT TO SCREW UP,

27:23.683 --> 27:26.561
{\an8}BECAUSE HE'S NOT
DONE ANYTHING YET.

27:26.644 --> 27:29.356
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA
TOLERATE ANYTHING.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.024
{\an8}- OW!
WE WERE TALKING.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.234
{\an8}- I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I THREW IT AT YOU.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.361
{\an8}- I [bleep] UP
SIX MONTHS AGO.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.696
{\an8}BIG DEAL.
YOU'RE THE FAKEST IN THE HOUSE.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.323
{\an8}AND I'LL MAKE YOU CRUMBLE
REAL [bleep] QUICK.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.783
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:39.866 --> 27:40.867
{\an8}- OH, THEY'RE FIGHTING.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.702
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT?
BREAK THE [bleep] UP.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.300
{\an8}- I JUST WANT MY SPACE.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.428
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE,
AND SAM DOESN'T GET THAT.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.764
{\an8}SHE JUST WANTS
TO PICK AND PICK,

28:02.847 --> 28:03.890
{\an8}PICK AND PICK.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.517
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.267
{\an8}- NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU, SAM.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.312
{\an8}- PROMISE?
- YEAH.

28:09.396 --> 28:12.774
{\an8}- SAMMI, WE'RE LEAVING!

28:12.857 --> 28:14.692
{\an8}- I'M, LIKE,
MENTALLY PREPARING MYSELF

28:14.776 --> 28:17.320
{\an8}TO GET YELLED AT
BY DANNY RIGHT NOW.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.321
{\an8}- HEY, BITCH.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.823
{\an8}- HELLO, HELLO.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.533
{\an8}- HEY.

28:21.616 --> 28:24.202
{\an8}- GOOD AFTERNOON, DANIELSON.

28:24.285 --> 28:28.164
{\an8}- YOU'RE TWO HOURS LATE
AND YOU'RE NOT WEARING A SHIRT?

28:28.248 --> 28:29.958
{\an8}GET SERIOUS, GIRLS.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.292
{\an8}- DANNY'S SUCH A BUZZKILL.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.545
{\an8}LIKE, RELAX, BRO.
IT'S A T-SHIRT SHOP.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.505
{\an8}YOU NEED A XANAX.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.674
{\an8}RELAX.

28:37.757 --> 28:38.800
{\an8}- THIS IS 25.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.635
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AN EXTRA LARGE.

28:40.718 --> 28:41.678
{\an8}- NO?
- I'M A MEDIUM.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.138
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.598
{\an8}- I JUST DON'T LIKE WORK
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE WORKING.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.476
{\an8}I HAVE TO BE LIKE,
"HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.603
{\an8}"HOW ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT A SHIRT?

28:50.687 --> 28:52.230
{\an8}OH, NO, YOU DON'T?
OKAY. ENJOY YOUR DAY."

28:52.313 --> 28:53.481
{\an8}THAT'S NOT ME!

28:53.565 --> 28:55.984
{\an8}- SO WHY DON'T YOU SELL
THOSE TWO LADIES A TANK TOP?

28:56.067 --> 28:57.068
{\an8}- I ALREADY ASKED.
THEY DON'T WANT ANY.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.987
{\an8}- THEY DON'T WANT
ANYTHING FROM YOU?

28:59.070 --> 29:00.572
{\an8}- MM-HMM.
- THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER.

29:00.655 --> 29:01.739
{\an8}- MY FAVORITE
PART OF THE JOB

29:01.823 --> 29:02.991
{\an8}IS HANGING OUT WITH JENNY,

29:03.074 --> 29:04.576
{\an8}BECAUSE JENNY'S
MY BEST FRIEND,

29:04.659 --> 29:06.578
{\an8}AND WE CAN JUST, YOU KNOW,
HAVE GIRL TIME AT WORK.

29:06.661 --> 29:10.206
{\an8}- AND I AM SINGLE,
BUT IT'S, LIKE, I'M HAPPY...

29:10.290 --> 29:10.832
{\an8}SEEING ROGER.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.500
{\an8}AND WHAT IS SINGLE?

29:12.584 --> 29:13.710
{\an8}LIKE, SINGLE'S,
LIKE, BEING ALONE

29:13.793 --> 29:16.004
{\an8}AND, LIKE, LOOKING AND
HOOKING UP WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE

29:16.087 --> 29:17.338
{\an8}THAT I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED IN.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.840
{\an8}- LIKE ME.
- NOT LIKE YOU.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.341
{\an8}- YEAH, LIKE ME.
- YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.803
{\an8}- I'M [bleep] LONELY,
AND I CAN'T FIND ANYBODY.

29:23.887 --> 29:24.512
{\an8}I HATE BEING SINGLE.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.931
{\an8}I'M JUST SAYING, JENNI.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.057
{\an8}YOU JUST BROKE UP WITH TOM,

29:28.141 --> 29:29.392
{\an8}AND NOW YOU'RE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.435
{\an8}THAT'S IT.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.187
{\an8}- BUT HE'S JUST
A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.063
{\an8}LIKE, ROGER'S A GOOD TIME
THAT I DON'T WANT TO SCREW UP,

29:34.147 --> 29:35.690
{\an8}BECAUSE HE'S NOT DONE
ANYTHING YET TO PISS ME OFF.

29:35.773 --> 29:38.193
{\an8}THE MOMENT HE DOES SOMETHING,
I'M OUT.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.737
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA
TOLERATE ANYTHING.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.323
{\an8}- OW! THAT'S ABUSE.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.782
{\an8}- YEAH.
- WE WERE TALKING.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.701
{\an8}- I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I THREW IT AT YOU.

29:46.784 --> 29:49.787
{\an8}NOW GET ON THE FLOOR.
MAKE SOME SALES.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.129
{\an8}- YOU GUYS AIN'T COMING OUT?

29:58.213 --> 29:59.380
{\an8}- I THINK SAM MIGHT GO OUT.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.383
{\an8}- WHY AREN'T YOU GOING OUT?
YOU CAN GO.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.760
{\an8}- I KNOW I CAN GO OUT.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.262
{\an8}I'M CHOOSING TO STAY HOME.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.598
{\an8}- WANT TO JUST BREAK UP?

30:08.681 --> 30:10.725
{\an8}- THAT'S YOUR ANSWER
TO EVERY PROBLEM.

30:10.808 --> 30:12.685
{\an8}WHATEVER, DUDE.

30:12.769 --> 30:13.853
{\an8}- DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.021
{\an8}- YOU SELFISH BITCH.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.773
{\an8}GO THE [bleep] OUT.
DO ME A FAVOR.

30:16.856 --> 30:17.857
{\an8}- PAULY, READY?

30:17.941 --> 30:18.900
{\an8}WE'RE GOING.
CAB'S HERE.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.818
{\an8}- I NEED TO BE BY MYSELF.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.320
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:22.403 --> 30:23.071
{\an8}- OH, THEY'RE FIGHTING.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.697
{\an8}- SO IS SHE COMING OR WHAT?

30:24.781 --> 30:26.115
{\an8}'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THE FIGHT.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.075
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW, BRO.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.117
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT ME TO BACK OFF?

30:28.201 --> 30:29.452
{\an8}- DO WHAT YOU WANT.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.620
{\an8}I JUST DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW,

30:30.703 --> 30:31.996
{\an8}TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.248
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- JUST GO DOWNSTAIRS.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.707
{\an8}LEAVE ME ALONE.
PLEASE.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.918
{\an8}- HELL HAS TO BE
JUST LIKE THIS.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.503
{\an8}- YEAH.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.713
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY RON
AND SAM WERE FIGHTING RIGHT NOW.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.466
{\an8}I MEAN, WE'RE WAITING FOR SAM,
WHO'S STRAIGHTENING HER HAIR,

30:43.550 --> 30:45.760
{\an8}WHOSE HAIR
IS ALREADY STRAIGHT.

30:45.843 --> 30:47.470
{\an8}COME ON, MAN.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.014
{\an8}THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS TO BE
STRAIGHTENED OUT IS HER BRAIN.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.433
{\an8}- SAM,
ARE YOU COMING?

30:52.517 --> 30:55.186
{\an8}- WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?

30:55.270 --> 30:57.981
{\an8}- ANY MINUTE.

30:58.064 --> 30:58.940
{\an8}- PROBABLY NOT.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.734
{\an8}- WHA--?
- PROBABLY NOT.

31:01.818 --> 31:05.280
{\an8}- PROBABLY NOT.
SHE'S NOT GOING.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.573
{\an8}THAT'S A NO.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.742
{\an8}[sighs]
ALL RIGHT.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.452
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.620
{\an8}- YOU GUYS HAVE MANAGED
TO [bleep] UP T-SHIRT TIME.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.582
{\an8}NOW I'M CHANGING MY T-SHIRT.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.042
{\an8}- WHOO! PARTY.

31:19.377 --> 31:23.131
{\an8}- SHOTS!

31:23.214 --> 31:24.215
{\an8}- LAST TIME I SEEN DANIELLE,

31:24.299 --> 31:25.466
{\an8}SHE THREW A DRINK
IN MY FACE.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.468
{\an8}I GOT MY EYES OPEN
AND I GOT MY GUARD UP.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.428
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'LL DO.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.098
{\an8}- WHAT PART OF
"DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,

31:32.181 --> 31:33.433
{\an8}LOOK ME IN THE FACE
AND BREAK UP WITH ME"

31:33.516 --> 31:34.434
{\an8}DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

31:44.402 --> 31:47.405
{\an8}- YOU GUYS READY TO ROLL OUT?

31:47.488 --> 31:51.492
{\an8}- BYE, SAM!

31:51.576 --> 31:53.578
{\an8}- WELL, SINCE IT'S ONLY
ME AND THE BOYS,

31:53.661 --> 31:56.331
{\an8}I GUESS
I'M DRINKING TONIGHT.

31:56.414 --> 31:56.998

32:15.058 --> 32:17.435

{\an8}[laughs]

32:34.702 --> 32:36.579
{\an8}- LAST TIME I SEEN DANIELLE,

32:36.663 --> 32:40.917
{\an8}SHE THREW A DRINK IN MY FACE.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.168
{\an8}SO NOW I'M SEEING DANIELLE.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.753
{\an8}I GOT MY EYES OPEN,
AND I GOT MY GUARD UP.

32:43.836 --> 32:44.921
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'LL DO.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.798
{\an8}WHAT'S UP?

32:49.884 --> 32:51.886
{\an8}- NO.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.573
{\an8}- DANIELLE STALKED MY WHOLE
ENTIRE LIFE LAST SUMMER.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.328
{\an8}WELL, I DON'T HOLD A GRUDGE.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.496
{\an8}WE MADE A TRUCE.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.415
{\an8}NOW WE'LL SEE IF SHE CHANGES.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.672
{\an8}- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.929
{\an8}- I HAD A TALK WITH HIM TODAY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

33:35.012 --> 33:36.013
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

33:36.097 --> 33:36.848
{\an8}- I'M LIKE,
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?"

33:36.931 --> 33:39.934
{\an8}LIKE,
"WHAT DID I DO NOW?"

33:40.017 --> 33:40.935
{\an8}LIKE, WHAT DID I DO NOW?

33:41.018 --> 33:42.103
{\an8}SO THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.271
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.440
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
LIKE ALWAYS.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.650
{\an8}SO THEN I'M LIKE, "OKAY."

33:47.734 --> 33:48.985
{\an8}NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I COME UP.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.611
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS
YOUR PROBLEM OR WHATEVER?"

33:50.695 --> 33:51.946
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "DO YOU WANT
TO JUST BREAK UP?"

33:52.029 --> 33:53.948
{\an8}'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA DEAL WITH THIS.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.658
{\an8}- ALL YOU DO IS FIGHT.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.784
{\an8}DOES HE HAVE HIS PERIOD?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.369
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.788
{\an8}- OY.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.873
{\an8}WHAT A GOOD TIME.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.624
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep],
IT'S COLD IN HERE.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.625
{\an8}- IT IS COLD AS [bleep].

34:04.709 --> 34:05.835
{\an8}- GET OVER HERE, GIRL.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.545
{\an8}- WHERE?

34:07.628 --> 34:08.504
{\an8}- BATHROOM "A."

34:08.588 --> 34:10.297
{\an8}THE SECOND I GET
DANIELLE TO THE HOUSE,

34:10.380 --> 34:11.799
{\an8}THE FIRST THING I DO
IS GRAB THE ACTUAL

34:11.882 --> 34:13.717
{\an8}"I HEART JEWISH GIRLS" SHIRT

34:13.801 --> 34:15.136
{\an8}THAT SHE MADE ME
LAST YEAR.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.804
{\an8}- DON'T SAY I NEVER
GAVE YOU SOMETHING.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.139
{\an8}- "I HEART JEWISH GIRLS."
OH, MY GOD.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.560
{\an8}- I DID THE STAR OF DAVID
BY MYSELF.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.478
{\an8}- I KNOW SHE THINKS
I THREW IT AWAY OR WHATEVER.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.521
{\an8}I KEPT IT.

34:25.605 --> 34:26.272
{\an8}AND SO I WANT TO WEAR IT

34:26.355 --> 34:27.815
{\an8}AND THEN COME OUT WITH IT.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.567
{\an8}AND JUST TO SEE
THAT FACE EXPRESSION

34:29.650 --> 34:31.110
{\an8}WOULD BE PRICELESS TO ME.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.489
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU EATING?
ITALIAN SAUSAGE?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.491
{\an8}- NO, IT'S NOT KOSHER.
I DON'T EAT THAT NO MORE.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.492
{\an8}- SHUT THE HELL UP.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.534
{\an8}- I GET ALL MY FOOD BLESSED.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.161
{\an8}KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:40.244 --> 34:44.290
{\an8}- FEEL ME KNOCKING?

34:44.373 --> 34:45.166
{\an8}[laughter]

34:48.710 --> 34:49.253
{\an8}- THIS IS THE SHIRT
YOU DID LAST YEAR.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.096
{\an8}THE LOOK ON THE FACE
OF DANIELLE WAS PRICELESS,

34:59.180 --> 35:01.265
{\an8}AND THAT'S ALL

{\an8}- YO,

35:43.808 --> 35:45.143
{\an8}WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE A BABY,

35:45.226 --> 35:46.936
{\an8}WHAT KIND OF BIRD
COMES AND DELIVERS THE BABY?

35:47.019 --> 35:48.437
{\an8}- A STORK.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.399
{\an8}[laughter]

35:51.482 --> 35:52.275
{\an8}- AW.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.322

35:58.406 --> 35:59.657
{\an8}- YOU IDIOT.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.117
{\an8}- YOU--WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

36:01.200 --> 36:02.743
{\an8}- I WASN'T LAUGHING AT THAT.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.287
{\an8}YO, WHAT DID JACK CLIMB UP?

36:04.370 --> 36:05.746

36:10.668 --> 36:13.588
{\an8}AFTER GIVING HER ALL THIS
[bleep] ABOUT STALKING MY LIFE?

36:13.671 --> 36:16.424
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON
THROUGH THIS GIRL'S HEAD.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.885
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, IT WAS GOOD
WE MADE PEACE.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.761
{\an8}I'LL SEE YOU.
- BYE.

36:20.845 --> 36:21.637
{\an8}HAVE FUN THIS SUMMER.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.307

36:24.390 --> 36:27.560
{\an8}[laughter]

36:34.192 --> 36:36.527
{\an8}- COME BACK OVER HERE.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.196
{\an8}IT'S COLD.

36:40.907 --> 36:41.199
{\an8}WANT TO COME BACK HERE?

36:49.707 --> 36:52.627
{\an8}I STRAIGHT UP DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS WITH YOU ANYMORE.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.420
{\an8}- STOP THREATENING ME.
SERIOUSLY.

36:54.503 --> 36:55.296
{\an8}- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TAKE IT SO NEGATIVE?

36:55.379 --> 36:58.007
{\an8}DO YOU WANT TO COME TO BED
WITH ME?

36:58.090 --> 37:01.469
{\an8}- OBVIOUSLY NOT, IF I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN UP OVER THERE YET.

37:01.552 --> 37:02.845
{\an8}- RON?

37:04.305 --> 37:05.222
{\an8}- LOOK AT ME.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.641
{\an8}CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THE [bleep] I DID?

37:06.724 --> 37:08.309
{\an8}BECAUSE THIS ISN'T
FAIR TO ME RIGHT NOW.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.727
{\an8}IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME ANYMORE.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.108
{\an8}- SO IF YOU WANT THIS
TO BE OVER, LET'S BREAK UP.

37:18.527 --> 37:20.112
{\an8}- RA, RA, RA, RA, RA, RA, RA.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.447
{\an8}SHE TALKS SO MUCH SOMETIMES,

37:21.530 --> 37:22.448
{\an8}I'M JUST LIKE, "[bleep] IT."

37:22.531 --> 37:24.742
{\an8}LIKE,
I CAN'T TAKE THIS [bleep].

37:24.825 --> 37:26.035
{\an8}- SO ARE WE--
LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.413
{\an8}I WANT TO BE MATURE
AND TALK ABOUT THIS.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.289
{\an8}WE'RE DONE?

37:31.582 --> 37:35.002
{\an8}YOU'RE OVER?
- MM-HMM.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.254
{\an8}- LOOK ME IN THE FACE
AND BREAK UP WITH ME, PLEASE.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.300
{\an8}WHAT PART OF
"DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,

37:41.384 --> 37:42.009
{\an8}LOOK ME IN THE FACE
AND BREAK UP WITH ME"

37:42.093 --> 37:44.512
{\an8}DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

37:44.595 --> 37:47.014
{\an8}- IT'S OVER. WE'RE BROKEN UP.
WE'RE FINISHED. OKAY?

37:50.142 --> 37:53.938
{\an8}MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SAM THIS
SUMMER, BIG BALL OF [bleep].

37:54.021 --> 37:56.565
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY,
CAN YOU TALK TO ME?

37:56.649 --> 37:59.193
{\an8}RON.

38:01.862 --> 38:05.199
{\an8}LISTEN TO ME,
BECAUSE I'M DONE WITH THIS.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.827
{\an8}I KNOW,
BUT I NEED CLOSURE.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.203
{\an8}I NEED [bleep] CLOSURE,
BRO.

38:09.286 --> 38:10.746
{\an8}- JUST [bleep] SICKENING.

38:10.830 --> 38:11.455
{\an8}GO THE [bleep] OUT.
DO ME A FAVOR.

38:19.588 --> 38:22.216
{\an8}- LOOK ME IN THE FACE
AND BREAK UP WITH ME, PLEASE.

38:22.299 --> 38:23.009
{\an8}- IT'S OVER.
WE'RE BROKEN UP.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.469
{\an8}WE'RE FINISHED. OKAY?

38:25.553 --> 38:26.887
{\an8}[bleep].

38:26.971 --> 38:28.973
{\an8}- I NEED CLOSURE.

38:29.056 --> 38:29.890
{\an8}- THERE'S NO CLOSURE.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.142
{\an8}JUST LEAVE ME
THE [bleep] ALONE.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.185
{\an8}- I NEED CLOSURE, BRO.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.603
{\an8}- IT'S KIND OF
LIKE A DRAWER.

38:34.687 --> 38:37.148
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA STUFF IT.
YOU'RE GONNA STUFF IT.

38:37.231 --> 38:38.232
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA STUFF IT.

38:38.315 --> 38:39.900
{\an8}SOONER OR LATER,
YOU CAN'T CLOSE IT.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.069
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S
WHY I'M FINALLY EXPLODING,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.196
{\an8}BECAUSE I CAN'T KEEP
ANY MORE [bleep] IN.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.740
{\an8}YOU'RE A [bleep]
WASTE OF TIME.

38:45.823 --> 38:46.991
{\an8}I [bleep] UP
SIX MONTHS AGO.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.242
{\an8}BIG [bleep] DEAL.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.827
{\an8}I'M THE REASON
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.454
{\an8}I'M THE REASON
YOU GOT THROUGH MIAMI.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.413
{\an8}SO [bleep] REMEMBER THAT

38:52.496 --> 38:55.416
{\an8}BEFORE YOU EVER [bleep]
TALK DOWN ON ME.

38:55.499 --> 38:56.917
{\an8}DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME

38:57.001 --> 38:59.086
{\an8}'CAUSE NOW YOU THINK YOU GOT
SOME FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.337
{\an8}YOU'RE THE FAKEST
IN THE HOUSE,

39:00.421 --> 39:01.922
{\an8}AND I'LL MAKE YOU CRUMBLE
REAL [bleep] QUICK.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.758
{\an8}YOU WILL [bleep] CRUMBLE
REAL QUICK.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.843
{\an8}- YOU GET THIS
AND GET THIS RIGHT,

39:05.926 --> 39:08.095
{\an8}AND DON'T ROLL
YOUR [bleep] EYES AT ME.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.598
{\an8}I HAVE BEEN THROUGH
E-[bleep]-NOUGH.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.515
{\an8}AND YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND

39:11.599 --> 39:13.517
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep]
YOU PUT ME THROUGH.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.311
{\an8}I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL EVER UNDERSTAND IT.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.687
{\an8}EVER.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.022
{\an8}SO GO AHEAD
AND BE MAD AT ME.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.273
{\an8}I FINALLY REALIZED,
LIKE, A LOT.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.275
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN MAKING
YOUR [bleep] MY [bleep]

39:21.358 --> 39:21.942
{\an8}FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.944
{\an8}- THIS IS IT.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.488
{\an8}LIKE,
THIS IS THE BREAKING POINT

39:25.571 --> 39:26.864
{\an8}TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

39:26.947 --> 39:31.702
{\an8}AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN I'M FINE WITH IT.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.370
{\an8}- GUESS IT IS WHAT IT IS.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.794
{\an8}- YEAH.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.378
{\an8}- TOMORROW WE'LL FIGURE OUT
THE ROOM SITUATION.

39:41.462 --> 39:45.466
{\an8}- I'M GONNA MOVE MY ROOM
AND MY STUFF OUT.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.802
{\an8}I THINK WHEN YOU'RE
LIVING IN THE SAME ROOM

39:47.885 --> 39:49.345
{\an8}AND YOU'RE UP
EACH OTHER'S ASS ALL THE TIME,

39:49.428 --> 39:52.973
{\an8}SOMETIMES A BREAK AWAY FROM ALL
THE NEGATIVITY AND JUST MADNESS

39:53.057 --> 39:54.642
{\an8}IS THE BEST THING.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.852
{\an8}I'M DONE WITH IT.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.563
{\an8}- IF SAM WANTS TO BREAK UP,
THEN SAM WANTS TO BREAK UP.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.066
{\an8}ME NOT BEING WITH HER IS GONNA
MAKE HER TIME HERE TERRIBLE.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.652
{\an8}I CAN MAKE HER TIME AROUND ME
THE WORST TIME,

40:04.735 --> 40:07.404
{\an8}AND I'M GETTING TO A POINT
WHERE IT'S, LIKE,

40:07.488 --> 40:09.323
{\an8}"YOU KNOW WHAT?
[bleep] YOU."

40:09.406 --> 40:10.950
{\an8}AND THAT'S THE POINT
THAT I'M AT RIGHT NOW.
