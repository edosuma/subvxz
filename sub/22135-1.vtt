00:02.002 --> 00:03.237
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.753
DISPATCHER (over radio):
Attention all units:

00:23.524 --> 00:24.892
MALE OFFICER:

Heading there now.

00:27.061 --> 00:30.198
(tires squealing)

00:35.869 --> 00:38.206
Unit 1835, we have a
visual on the suspect

00:38.239 --> 00:39.940
heading east towards
Wellington.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.275
Copy that.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.443
Coming up on Wellington now.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.546

00:58.226 --> 01:01.229

OFFICER (over loudspeaker):
On the ground now!

01:05.166 --> 01:06.967
Please.
OFFICER:
Put your hands on your head.

(electrical trilling,
woman gasping)

01:16.644 --> 01:18.879
(gasps)

01:18.912 --> 01:20.114
Stop! Stop!

01:20.148 --> 01:21.882
(tires squeak,
hissing, whooshing)

01:21.915 --> 01:25.553
(glass clinking)

01:25.586 --> 01:26.887
What the...?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.456
(pops, crackles)

01:28.489 --> 01:30.458
(train horn droning)

01:30.491 --> 01:34.762
(dog barking)

01:36.664 --> 01:38.232
You getting anything?

01:38.266 --> 01:39.733
Working on it.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.769
Yeah, you seriously think
she's here, man?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.338
I mean, she was just
two miles away.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.841
(ding, whoosh)

01:47.875 --> 01:51.245
(siren blaring, panting)

01:51.279 --> 01:52.613
She's close.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.082
Closer than the last time
she was close?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.217
(laughs)

01:58.952 --> 02:02.623
She's moving...
strangely.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.091
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

02:04.124 --> 02:05.859
he just likes
keeping us out in the cold.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.461
(laughs)

02:10.998 --> 02:12.800
(high-pitched tone sounds)

02:12.833 --> 02:15.303
Look.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.738
(soft, high-pitched tone
sounding)

02:20.574 --> 02:23.777
There.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.546
Well, that's
interesting.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.747
Told ya.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.721
Hey, you all right?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.122
Want me
to warm you up?
I'm okay.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.157
You can warm me
up later, though.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.992
Oh, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.503
She's there.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.704
Inside.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.909
(thudding, rattling)

03:00.748 --> 03:04.552
Hey... go.

03:10.258 --> 03:13.861
(woman panting loudly)

03:13.894 --> 03:16.029
It's okay. We're
just gonna talk. Oh.
(gasps)

03:16.063 --> 03:18.499
Okay. Well,
hey, hold up.
(grunts)

03:18.532 --> 03:20.501
No. Wait a minute!

03:20.534 --> 03:22.403
Okay. Whoa. Whoa.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.604
(panting)

03:23.637 --> 03:24.872
Calm down, all right?

03:24.905 --> 03:26.674
You with the cops?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.442
I can't go back.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.778
We're not cops, okay?
We heard you broke out

03:30.811 --> 03:32.546
of the mutant detention
center and we came looking.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.014
I don't understand.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.783
Who are you?

03:38.286 --> 03:41.121
Just a couple of
freaks, same as you.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.859
Look, I'm Marcos,
this is Lorna.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.363
Now, trust me, we have all been
where you are, or worse.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.131
We can help.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.367
Now come with us.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.837
We can get you
some place safe...
Guys!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.139
There's trouble.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.541
Come on, get dressed.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.143
You're with us now.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.879
MARCOS:
What is it?

04:05.913 --> 04:08.248
MAN:
Cops. Coming
fast this way.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.483
Kill the lights.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.285
How many?
(whooshing)

04:11.319 --> 04:13.954
At least ten,
from the west and south.

04:13.987 --> 04:17.157
(sirens blaring)

04:17.190 --> 04:19.293
(tires squealing)

04:22.262 --> 04:25.265
OFFICER (over loudspeaker):
This is the Atlanta
Police Department.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.801
We know the fugitive is
in the building.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.137
Come out now,
or we will open fire.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.307
OFFICER 2:
The window!

04:33.341 --> 04:34.642
One suspect
at the window!

04:34.675 --> 04:37.144
(whooshing, whirring,
popping)

04:37.177 --> 04:39.847
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

04:39.880 --> 04:41.315
OFFICER:
Open fire!

04:41.349 --> 04:45.285
(gunfire,
glass breaking)

04:50.991 --> 04:54.261
Lorna!
I'm fine.
Find us a way out!

04:54.294 --> 04:55.996
(glass breaking)

04:57.197 --> 04:58.966
(gunfire)

04:58.999 --> 05:03.837
(glass breaking)

05:03.871 --> 05:05.873
(indistinct shouting)

05:06.807 --> 05:08.275
(gasps, mutters)

05:08.308 --> 05:09.309
(grunting)

05:13.013 --> 05:14.281
(indistinct shouting)

05:14.314 --> 05:15.649
Lorna! Get out of there!

05:16.884 --> 05:19.286
Go! Go!

05:19.319 --> 05:21.288
(high-pitched trilling)

05:21.321 --> 05:24.392
(man groaning)

05:24.425 --> 05:26.460
(high-pitched trill)

05:26.494 --> 05:29.930
Come on! Over here!

05:31.264 --> 05:33.033
(gunshot)

05:33.066 --> 05:34.635
(Marcos groans)

05:34.668 --> 05:36.203
LORNA:
Marcos!

05:36.236 --> 05:37.671
(yells)
God!

05:38.772 --> 05:41.174
(groans)

05:42.376 --> 05:44.812
(Lorna roaring)

05:44.845 --> 05:47.548
Lorna! Come back!

05:47.581 --> 05:48.916
Come, come back!

05:50.918 --> 05:52.319
(yelling)

05:52.352 --> 05:53.987
Freeze!
(Lorna groaning,
electrical hissing)

05:54.021 --> 05:55.355
(Lorna screaming)

05:55.389 --> 05:57.658
(electricity crackles,
man groans)

05:57.691 --> 06:00.327
MARCOS:
Lorna! Stop!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.730
LORNA: No!
OFFICER: Put your hands
behind your back!

06:02.763 --> 06:05.666
Marcos!
Lorna!

06:05.699 --> 06:08.602
*

06:08.636 --> 06:12.239
MAN: I understand
you have some concerns

06:12.272 --> 06:14.274
about your son, Andy?

06:14.307 --> 06:16.343
Yes, we believe
he's being bullied.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.011
Belleview High has

06:18.045 --> 06:20.514
a zero tolerance policy
towards bullying.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.416
That's why we came.

06:22.450 --> 06:26.420
Um, Andy and I have always been
very close, but lately he...

06:26.454 --> 06:30.223
he just stopped
talking to me.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.725
It's affecting his grades.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.360
He-He's not sleeping.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.128
In situations
like this,

06:35.162 --> 06:39.199
we like to use
the "CARE" system-- communicate,

06:39.232 --> 06:41.469
adjust, reconcile

06:41.502 --> 06:44.137
and empathize. First,
we take the kids,

06:44.171 --> 06:46.273
and we put them together
to talk.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.408
These boys are-are
tormenting our son.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.877
I understand that's upsetting.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.378
Stop right there.
Let me be clear.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.881
Andy needs help,

06:53.914 --> 06:58.118
and if he doesn't get it, I will
sue this school into oblivion.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.754
Mr. Strucker,

07:00.788 --> 07:02.790
we have procedures. I can't...

07:02.823 --> 07:04.792
Then get someone who can.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.293
Now.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.966
Okay, I'll-I'll be right back.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.269
(door opens)

07:16.303 --> 07:20.007
Wow. Scary.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.742
(chuckles)
Was it too much?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.144
I felt like the glaring was
a little over the top.
No.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.346
That was the perfect
amount of glaring.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.048
(phone buzzes)

07:30.518 --> 07:32.953
Ugh. I got to go
to Garland.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.522
Plea conference
with a suspect.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.124
They need me there ASAP.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.626
Will you tell the kids
I'm really sorry?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.027
I'll be back tomorrow.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.461
The kids understand.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.430
You're keeping us safe.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.699
I love you.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.535
I love you, too.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.073
Bye.
Bye.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.212
* If I told you
I loved you... *

07:59.246 --> 08:00.981
You have no preference?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.850
They are two
completely different outfits.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.451
I don't know. I'm sorry.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.553
You look good in both.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.854
Not helpful, Jack.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.455
Now just pick an outfit.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.857
(sighs)
I don't know. Um...

08:09.890 --> 08:11.659
CAITLIN:
Lauren, I'm home.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.894
The blue one. Do the blue one.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.395
That one looks nice.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.464
Also, uh, do you want me
to pick you up?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.999
Because it's no problem.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.668
No, but I'll push
for an 11:30 curfew.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.870
I'll see you tonight.
Bye.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.471
So, Lauren,
how was choir?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.641
Good. We're practicing
for the spring concert.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.809
Are you still going
to the dance tonight?

08:28.842 --> 08:32.546
Want me to show you
some of my moves?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.582
No, thank you.
(laughs)

08:36.784 --> 08:38.385
How about you?
How was your day?

08:38.418 --> 08:39.920
Uh, bad.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.989
I mean, you were there.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.390
(laughs)

08:43.423 --> 08:45.225
I meant your classes.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.860
Anything interesting?

08:46.894 --> 08:49.062
We had a debate
in social studies about the law

08:49.096 --> 08:51.231
they want to make
to test people with the X-gene

08:51.264 --> 08:52.566
and, like, monitor
them. I don't know.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.835
Anyway, this one kid
was, like, freaking out.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.169
I guess his cousin's
a mutie or something.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.239
Mutie, Andy? Racist much?

08:59.272 --> 09:01.408
What?
Person of genetic difference.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.743
You are such an ass!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.077
Okay, please.
You're fighting

09:04.111 --> 09:06.046
about social studies
class now.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.616
Can we not have
a normal conversation?

09:12.586 --> 09:15.188
(sighs)
Guess not.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.825
(lock buzzes)

09:20.460 --> 09:22.763
Ms. Dane?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.132
My name is Reed Strucker.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.601
This is my associate,
Carla Jackson.

09:27.635 --> 09:31.639
I'd offer you a seat,
but, uh, you know.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.207
You're accused of the attempted
murder of two police officers.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.144
That
plus the enhanced sentencing

09:37.177 --> 09:39.546
for the use
of your mutant abilities.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.048
Equals I'm screwed.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.083
Yeah, I got that.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.919
We can reduce the charges

09:45.953 --> 09:47.755
in exchange
for your cooperation.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.290
Look, all I know is,
I was walking in the rain,

09:50.323 --> 09:52.459
and some cops shot at me.

09:52.492 --> 09:56.596
Come on, Ms. Dane.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.465
You and your associates

09:58.498 --> 10:02.502
in the mutant underground
have aided and abetted dozens,

10:02.535 --> 10:06.139
if not hundreds, of fugitives.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.147
(trilling)

10:14.181 --> 10:16.684
Reed.
It's okay.

10:18.986 --> 10:23.556
(high-pitched,
rhythmic trilling)

10:28.729 --> 10:30.931
Believe it or not,
I'm trying to help you.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.500
These are serious charges.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.068
Attempted murder...

10:36.737 --> 10:39.840
(hissing)

10:39.873 --> 10:44.311
(groans)
Those screws in your
knee-- old sports injury?

10:44.344 --> 10:45.612
(groans)
If I wanted to,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.280
I could tear out those screws

10:47.314 --> 10:50.017
and show you
some attempted murder.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.885
(groans)

10:51.919 --> 10:56.389
Believe me, if I wanted
those cops dead, they'd be dead.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.831
There's a factor
you may not be aware of.

11:08.201 --> 11:12.205
I am gonna ask the court

11:12.239 --> 11:15.175
to assign you a lawyer, okay?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.880
You've got a big decision
to make, Ms. Dane.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.581
Son of a bitch.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.519
No, no, no, no.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.088
No.
(sobs)

11:28.121 --> 11:29.890
No! No!

11:29.923 --> 11:32.192
(shouting)

11:35.362 --> 11:36.463
(cries)

11:38.265 --> 11:40.433
Give it some thought.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.375
CAITLIN:
Be home at 11:30!

11:48.408 --> 11:50.811
I know, I know. I love you.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.790
Yo.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.391
What are you doing here?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.726
I snuck out.
I thought I'd go with you.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.595
Didn't you tell Mom
you were going to bed?

12:08.628 --> 12:11.131
Yeah, that's why they call it
sneaking. Can we go?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.900
You can't.
What if she finds out?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.301
If I get caught, I'll tell her
I was going down to Ian's.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.302
You won't get in trouble.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.636
When was the last time

12:16.669 --> 12:18.705
I got to go out on a weekend?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.940
It's like I'm a...

12:19.973 --> 12:22.609
one-one of those baby cows
they keep in the crates.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.211
Veal?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.547
Yeah. I'm being raised
like a veal.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.383
You really want
to go to a dance?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.586
After everything
that's been going on at school?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.755
You mean my fan club?

12:35.789 --> 12:39.426
(sighs) Yeah, whatever.
I'm used to them.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.662
(groans)

12:42.695 --> 12:43.931
Buckle up.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.732
(starts engine)

12:45.765 --> 12:48.135
*

12:48.168 --> 12:50.003
* We came to party

12:50.037 --> 12:52.239
* We came
to party *

12:52.272 --> 12:53.573
* And have a good time

12:53.606 --> 12:55.909
* And have
a good time *

12:55.943 --> 12:57.644
* We came to party

12:57.677 --> 12:59.847
* We came
to party *

12:59.880 --> 13:01.414
Oh, my God.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.584
* And have a good time

13:04.617 --> 13:05.819
Lauren.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.855
Hi.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.023
Okay, that's enough.

13:10.057 --> 13:10.958
Leave room for Jesus.

13:10.991 --> 13:11.992
Hey, dude.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.526
You, uh...
Going to the dance.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.129
Yeah, that's me.
I'm a dance guy now.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.698
Okay. Well, have fun.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.667
Yeah, you, too.

13:20.700 --> 13:24.437
* Hey, na, na, na, na

13:24.471 --> 13:26.006
Don't get pregnant!

13:26.039 --> 13:28.641
* We came to party

13:28.675 --> 13:29.776
* And have a good time

13:29.809 --> 13:31.278
* So, baby, tell me yes

13:31.311 --> 13:33.881
* And I will give you
everything *

13:33.914 --> 13:35.883
* So, baby, tell me yes

13:35.916 --> 13:38.651
* And I will be all yours
tonight *

13:38.685 --> 13:40.153
* So, baby, tell me yes

13:40.187 --> 13:44.557
* And I will give you
everything *

13:44.591 --> 13:46.159
Hey. Do you want to dance?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.628
* I will be right by your side

13:48.661 --> 13:51.464
* If I can't find the cure,
I'll *

13:51.498 --> 13:53.400
* I'll fix you with my love

13:53.433 --> 13:56.369
* No matter what you know,
I'll *

13:56.403 --> 13:58.171
* I'll fix you with my love

13:58.205 --> 14:00.173
* And if you say you're okay

14:00.207 --> 14:03.010
Are you sure you can't
stay out a little later?

14:03.043 --> 14:06.013
You know my mom.
It's not gonna happen.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.014
Just ask.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.848
I have Andy with me.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.683
I can't stay out later.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.986
* Be the cure

14:13.020 --> 14:15.889
*

14:15.923 --> 14:18.525
Hey, look who's here.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.527
The school called
my parents today.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.794
Look, I had nothing
to do with that, okay?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.265
You gonna do this here?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.834
In front of everyone?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.836
Yeah, I guess you're
right, Strucker.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.205
This isn't the place.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.407
No...
This is the place.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.675
Wait, no, no!

14:35.708 --> 14:38.411
* So, baby, tell me yes

14:38.445 --> 14:39.712
* And I will be all...

14:39.746 --> 14:40.580
Let me go!

14:41.714 --> 14:44.617
Help! Help me!
(grunts)

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
(grunts)

14:46.053 --> 14:49.056
Hey! Hey!
(grunts)

14:49.089 --> 14:50.190
Hey, Strucker.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.293
When was the last time
you took a shower?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.295
No, no, no... Aah! Aah!

14:55.328 --> 14:56.896
Sorry, man.
Too cold?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.598
Let me fix that.
(groans)

14:58.631 --> 15:01.434
How about... now?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.303
(shouting)
Is that warm enough for you?

15:03.336 --> 15:06.006
You had to go running
to Mommy and Daddy?

15:07.574 --> 15:08.942
(shouting)

15:08.976 --> 15:11.078
*

15:25.425 --> 15:27.594
What is that?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.696
*

15:36.136 --> 15:38.138
(shouting)

15:40.840 --> 15:43.143
(screaming, gasping)

15:45.945 --> 15:47.347
(shouting)

15:49.616 --> 15:50.950
(shouting)

15:52.652 --> 15:54.654
(screaming)

15:54.687 --> 15:56.456
Come on.
We need to get out of here.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.992
We need to go.
Come on!
No!

15:59.026 --> 16:00.193
Lauren, what
are you doing?

16:00.227 --> 16:01.494
Come on. We have to go!
Andy!

16:01.528 --> 16:03.130
Come on!
I need to find my brother!

16:03.163 --> 16:04.664
We have to...
Jack!

16:04.697 --> 16:05.865
Lauren! Lauren!

16:05.898 --> 16:08.935
(screaming, shouting distorting)

16:08.968 --> 16:10.603
*

16:10.637 --> 16:12.539
(creaking)

16:17.077 --> 16:19.679
(screaming, shouting continue)

16:24.417 --> 16:26.086
(gasps)

16:37.530 --> 16:40.500
Andy!
(shouting)

16:41.401 --> 16:44.237
Andy! Andy!

16:44.271 --> 16:46.073
(shouting)

16:46.106 --> 16:48.341
Andy!

16:48.375 --> 16:50.343
Andy! Andy, it's me!

16:50.377 --> 16:51.911
Andy! Look at me!

16:51.944 --> 16:53.146
It's me! It's me!

16:53.180 --> 16:55.482
Lauren? Lauren?
It's me. Let's go!

16:55.515 --> 16:57.350
Lauren, I'm-I'm sorry!
Come on!

16:57.384 --> 16:58.718
Lauren.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.387
(gasps)

17:00.420 --> 17:02.021
*

17:08.961 --> 17:11.364
*

17:29.048 --> 17:30.350
(indistinct chatter)

17:30.383 --> 17:33.019
SAGE:
So, Clarice is your real name?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.122
CLARICE:
Yep.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.123
Anyone we should contact?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.957
Family?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.459
No.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.794
My family...

17:41.828 --> 17:43.396
It's complicated.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.898
SAGE:
Right.

17:45.932 --> 17:50.270
Well, look, you'll stay here
with us for a few days, lay low,

17:50.303 --> 17:52.905
and then we will figure out
where to move you.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.775
Yeah.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.076
Thank you.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.047
Hold still. Almost done.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.216
I'm fine, John. We need
to go after Lorna.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.451
We get a team
together, we...

18:04.484 --> 18:06.453
And do what? Huh?

18:06.486 --> 18:07.920
Get one of us killed?

18:07.954 --> 18:09.722
Marcos, we barely got
away from a dozen cops.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.391
Now you want to take on
a hundred?

18:11.424 --> 18:12.992
We can't take that risk

18:13.025 --> 18:14.294
right now.
Then when?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.628
(sighs)

18:15.662 --> 18:17.564
The X-Men, the Brotherhood,

18:17.597 --> 18:19.065
we don't even know
if they exist anymore.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.800
We are alone.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.303
And we are getting picked off
one by one.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.338
Look around. We'd be risking
all these people.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.140
Everything we built.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.676
Everything Lorna built.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.612
Guys, we got
a situation.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.649
What is it?
REPORTER:
Yes, and as we have reported,

18:36.683 --> 18:39.752
breaking news on the mutant
attack at Belleview High.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.988
We believe two young mutants
to be responsible

18:42.021 --> 18:43.956
for the destruction.
We've also heard

18:43.990 --> 18:46.859
the federal authorities
will be getting involved.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.231
Well, if it wasn't too hot
before, it sure as hell is now.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.967
I'm sorry.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.970
ANDY:
It started happening.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.307
I couldn't stop it.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.542
I was just so angry.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.677
Oh, Andy, I...

19:04.711 --> 19:06.546
I mean, I-I
can't believe

19:06.579 --> 19:08.548
you di...
you didn't feel anything?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.717
I just can't believe
there wasn't any warning.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.784
Mom,

19:11.818 --> 19:14.687
accept it--
Andy is a mutant.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.489
That's how mutant
abilities first appear--

19:16.523 --> 19:18.291
it's moments of
stress or danger.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.026
Dad talks about this

19:20.059 --> 19:23.029
all the time.
Lauren, I... we-we all know

19:23.062 --> 19:25.031
about your father's work.
I-I just don't...

19:25.064 --> 19:27.667
see how that suddenly
makes you an expert.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.702
Mom, I know because...

19:32.171 --> 19:34.574
How do you think we
got out of that gym?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.547
What are you saying?

19:40.580 --> 19:43.583
I got us out.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.354
You, too?

19:47.387 --> 19:49.356
LAUREN: Remember when
we were coming back

19:49.389 --> 19:51.358
from that concert
at church?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.760
And the truck
almost hit us?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.662
(horn honking)

19:55.695 --> 19:57.764
(tires screeching)

19:57.797 --> 20:02.269
For weeks, you were saying
it was a miracle we didn't die.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.937
Mom...

20:04.971 --> 20:07.440
it wasn't a miracle.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.909
(exhales)

20:12.645 --> 20:14.614
That was three years ago.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.216
Honey, why...

20:17.250 --> 20:18.285
why didn't you tell me?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.453
Don't you think I tried?

20:20.487 --> 20:22.054
You can always talk to me.
Always.

20:22.088 --> 20:25.292
Your-your dad, too.
Whatever your issues.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.393
Are you serious?

20:26.426 --> 20:28.261
Dad puts people like us in jail.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.763
No, no, no, he
prosecutes criminals.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.765
(sniffles)
He-he...

20:32.799 --> 20:35.034
he's not against... mutants.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.438
It's-it's just the
ones who hurt people.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.239
You mean the ones like me.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.379
(doorbell rings)

20:46.413 --> 20:47.380
(heavy knocking)

20:47.414 --> 20:48.781
Oh.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.983
I'll get it.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.453
Come here.
Just stay here.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.990
(crickets chirping)

21:03.195 --> 21:05.598
Good evening.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.601
Mrs. Strucker, right?

21:08.635 --> 21:10.002
I'm Jace Turner.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.605
I'm with the Sentinel Services.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.841
We're a government agency. We
deal with genetically-related...

21:14.874 --> 21:16.275
I'm familiar with it.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.277
I'm here about Andrew
and Lauren.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.347
You're aware that there was a...

21:20.380 --> 21:23.082
bit of an incident
at the school this evening?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.918
Yeah. I-I heard.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.754
I need you to go get 'em for me.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.490
They're not going anywhere.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.926
They need an attorney.
My-my husband is a prosecutor.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.961
We're aware of that.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.464
Actually, under the
amended Patriot Act,

21:37.497 --> 21:39.332
we have to secure the safety
of the community first.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.100
What does that mean?
It means they're coming

21:41.133 --> 21:43.603
with us.
Just... for now.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.605
These are my children.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.807
You-you can't just
cart them off.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.710
Listen, Mrs. Strucker,
all right, I'm a father myself.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.845
Okay? I know how difficult
this must be for you.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.847
But you have to understand,

21:54.881 --> 21:56.849
this is partially
for their protection.
For their protection?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.885
Okay, let's not make this
harder than it has to be.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.387
Please step aside.
No, this is my home!

22:00.420 --> 22:02.288
You can't just come in here!
Ma'am...

22:02.321 --> 22:03.390
Yes, we can.
Do not make this harder...

22:03.423 --> 22:04.391
Yes, we can.
You're not getting...

22:04.424 --> 22:05.658
(grunts)

22:05.692 --> 22:07.560
ANDY:
Get away from my mom!

22:13.099 --> 22:15.034
Okay.
(nervous chuckle)

22:15.067 --> 22:17.036
Andrew, Lauren, listen to me.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.639
You need to calm down.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.474
You're gonna have
to come with us.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.543
All right?
We just have a few questions.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.981
Get out of our house now!

22:29.015 --> 22:31.884
(rumbling)

22:31.918 --> 22:33.420
Run! Go! Go! Go!

22:41.461 --> 22:42.729
Go!

22:48.367 --> 22:50.002
(starts engine)

22:50.036 --> 22:50.903
(click)

22:53.372 --> 22:55.575
(pounding on door)
LAUREN: Mom, they're coming!

22:56.242 --> 22:58.077
(screams)

22:58.110 --> 22:59.912
LAUREN: Andy,
what you did before-- do it!

22:59.946 --> 23:02.081
(grunts loudly)
(gunshots)

23:02.114 --> 23:04.116
(screams)
I can't!
It's not working!

23:04.451 --> 23:05.718
Drive!

23:06.285 --> 23:07.319
I can't see!

23:14.994 --> 23:16.295
(tires squeal)

23:20.467 --> 23:21.934
REED:
Caitlin, Caitlin, slow down.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.636
If there was a mutant attack
at the school,

23:23.670 --> 23:24.937
why were there people
at the house?

23:24.971 --> 23:27.239
You don't understand. I-I...

23:27.273 --> 23:29.375
I-I-I don't even know
where to begin.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.977
There's-there's so much.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.645
Just tell me, are the kids safe?

23:33.680 --> 23:34.981
Yeah.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.150
I mean...

23:38.184 --> 23:39.919
for now, but...
And-and the mutants,

23:39.952 --> 23:41.387
the ones that attacked them,
did they...

23:41.420 --> 23:43.756
They weren't attacked
by mutants, Reed.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.693
That's what I'm trying to say.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.597
Andy and Lauren...

23:50.630 --> 23:53.232
are...

23:53.265 --> 23:55.234
the mutants.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.470
*

23:57.504 --> 23:59.539
Oh, my God.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.344
Uh, Caitlin, Caitlin, uh...

24:05.377 --> 24:07.413
tell me where you are.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.217
REED:
The important thing is,
everyone's all right.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.622
Andy...

24:15.655 --> 24:17.790
was anyone actually hurt?

24:17.824 --> 24:19.526
I don't know.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.628
Okay? I-I don't remember it.

24:21.661 --> 24:22.829
It was just...

24:22.862 --> 24:24.531
it was all confusing.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.499
So, to be clear,

24:26.533 --> 24:28.968
you didn't touch them
before they touched...
LAUREN: Yes, Dad,

24:29.001 --> 24:30.537
they came after him.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.706
And after they
came at you...
This isn't a deposition, Reed.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.342
I am trying to understand
the situation.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.777
Legally, if they...

24:37.810 --> 24:39.045
I don't think it matters.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.713
The man from
Sentinel Services...

24:40.747 --> 24:43.149
Wait, Sentinel Services?
You mean the police?

24:43.182 --> 24:45.552
No. Sentinel Services.

24:45.585 --> 24:49.155
They were just gonna
take Lauren and Andy.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.190
You can't talk to Cal?
He's the D.A.

24:51.223 --> 24:54.126
He could...
This is way beyond
Cal's jurisdiction.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.897
Sentinel Services is
a federal agency.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.566
The only reason
you got away is

24:59.599 --> 25:02.001
they didn't have enough time
to put a full team together.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.539
We, uh...

25:06.573 --> 25:08.908
(whispers):
we have to go.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.176
Now.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.345
Um...

25:14.446 --> 25:17.383
Okay, we-we could
call Jenny.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.385
I am not talking about staying
at your sister's condo

25:19.418 --> 25:20.587
in Phoenix for a few days.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.221
I mean, we have
to go somewhere

25:22.254 --> 25:24.957
where the mutant laws
are looser.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.026
Like...

25:27.059 --> 25:29.495
Mexico

25:29.528 --> 25:30.730
or...

25:30.763 --> 25:32.198
Mexico?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.366
Everything we own
is at the house.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.168
The last time Sentinel Services

25:36.202 --> 25:38.204
got involved
with one of my cases,

25:38.237 --> 25:40.506
the suspect disappeared.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.243
I am not gonna
let that happen to us.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.213
I'm gonna figure
something out, I promise.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.082
There is nothing more important
to me than my family.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.394
Walk me through what you need
from us again, please.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.897
We're gonna need access
to Mr. Strucker's office,

26:04.931 --> 26:06.899
his computer, his e-mail.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.201
And you realize there may be
confidential information

26:09.235 --> 26:10.536
related to cases?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.271
Court order's
being prepared.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.874
JONES: I understand-- I got
to say, though, I do find it

26:14.907 --> 26:16.475
hard to believe
he would just run.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.778
I mean, he's been
with this office for 15 years,

26:18.811 --> 26:20.747
the mutant task force
for the last five.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.214
JACE:
In my experience,

26:22.248 --> 26:25.084
things change when
it's your own kid.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.585
(phone rings)

26:26.619 --> 26:27.787
This is Carla.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.555
REED:
Carla, it's me.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.659
Reed, where are you?
What's going on?

26:32.692 --> 26:35.427
Sentinel Services is upstairs
in our offices.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.429
I know. That's why I'm calling.
I need your help.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.999
Help? What do you need?

26:40.032 --> 26:42.769
I need the case file for the
mutant network investigation.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.137
(quietly):
What? Are you serious? That's...

26:45.171 --> 26:46.906
I don't know what else to do.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.808
I have to get my family
someplace safe.

26:48.841 --> 26:51.343
If I can contact them,
they might be able to help.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.079
Reed, you've done a lot for me.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.580
I owe my career to you,

26:54.613 --> 26:56.816
but this is an open case--
I could get disbarred.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.350
I could get arrested.

26:58.384 --> 27:01.453
This is my children,
Carla, please.

27:15.534 --> 27:18.337
LAUREN:
I know this, like, sucks,
but honestly,

27:18.370 --> 27:21.941
it's a relief to finally be able
to talk to Mom and Dad about it.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.176
Guess all it took
was me ruining our lives.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.047
Andy. It wasn't your fault.
If it wasn't for me,

27:28.080 --> 27:30.616
we wouldn't even
be here-- I mean, I
nearly got us killed,

27:30.649 --> 27:32.318
and then last
night with the car,

27:32.351 --> 27:33.485
I could have
actually helped,

27:33.519 --> 27:35.654
and I-I couldn't
even do anything.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.956
(sighs)

27:36.989 --> 27:39.058
It gets better.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.660
At first, it's like...

27:41.694 --> 27:44.731
it's like a sneeze--
something that just happens.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.034
You have to work at it.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.071
What does it feel
like when you...?

27:52.104 --> 27:54.406
You know when you
put your hand

27:54.440 --> 27:56.843
out of the window
of a moving car?

27:56.876 --> 28:00.312
You can feel the air
and, like... guide it?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.881
Yeah.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.650
I can... push
the air together.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.719
With water, too,
other stuff--

28:06.753 --> 28:09.188
it's just... harder.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.157
What about you?

28:11.190 --> 28:12.825
I don't know.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.828
I-I was looking at those guys,
and I just...

28:15.862 --> 28:18.430
wanted to push
everything away, you know?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.232
Well, I'd say you did
a pretty good job of that.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.701
A-plus.

28:22.735 --> 28:25.671
First A-plus I've ever gotten.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.039
(laughs)

28:27.073 --> 28:28.274
Hey.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.542
Who taught you how to swim?

28:30.576 --> 28:31.878
You.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.146
I can teach you this.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.788
Watch.

28:47.593 --> 28:48.761
Dude!

28:48.795 --> 28:51.530
Now you try.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.765
Take it slow.

28:55.434 --> 28:58.637
Focus... on
how you felt.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.172
Okay?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.846
(low rumbling)

29:14.620 --> 29:16.055
(rumbling fades)

29:16.088 --> 29:18.157
That's good.
That's awesome.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.160
(rumbling)

29:23.930 --> 29:25.731
Andy, that's enough.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.665
Andy.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.735
LAUREN:
Andy!

29:29.768 --> 29:30.702
Andy!

29:34.673 --> 29:35.607
(gasps)

29:35.641 --> 29:37.743
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.411
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.180
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
We got to go.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.548
We got to go. Go!

29:57.196 --> 29:58.530
Is that your dog?

29:58.564 --> 30:00.032
(whines)
MARCOS:
She's, uh...

30:00.066 --> 30:02.068
she's everybody's, really.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.006
I just wanted to say...

30:07.039 --> 30:08.640
thanks for,
you know,

30:08.674 --> 30:10.442
saving me.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.979
Even though I threw
a coffeepot at your head.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.713
And a mug.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.715
And a mug.

30:16.748 --> 30:17.850
(exhales sharply)

30:17.884 --> 30:19.351
Don't worry about it.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.789
So...

30:23.822 --> 30:25.191
this group--

30:25.224 --> 30:27.126
you guys run it?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.327
No.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.962
The network's nationwide.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.899
Founded after the anti-mutant
laws first got bad.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.367
Just before the X-Men
disappeared.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.336
What about this place?

30:37.369 --> 30:38.905
Uh, it's been abandoned
since Oakwood.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.307
Figure it's the last
place they'd look.

30:41.340 --> 30:45.077
I got brought into this station
by, uh, John and...

30:45.111 --> 30:47.413
and by Lorna.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.586
I guess this has something to do
with getting her out of jail?

30:54.620 --> 30:56.755
Yeah. Well...

30:56.788 --> 30:58.824
that was the idea.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.859
Should work great,

31:00.893 --> 31:03.229
as long as they have no guards
or cameras...

31:03.262 --> 31:04.363
Or smoke detectors?

31:05.631 --> 31:08.067
Yeah.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.402
For what it's worth,

31:10.436 --> 31:12.504
uh...

31:12.538 --> 31:14.941
I know you lost her
helping me, and I'm...

31:14.974 --> 31:16.542
I'm sorry.

31:16.575 --> 31:20.079
That's all right--
wasn't your fault.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.052
(groans)

31:27.753 --> 31:29.922
You got yourself out of prison

31:29.956 --> 31:31.991
using some kind
of portal, right?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.694
You think you
could get someone in?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.430
It doesn't work like that.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.765
It's bad if I try

31:39.798 --> 31:41.767
to go someplace
that I can't see,

31:41.800 --> 31:42.969
someplace I haven't been.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.636
What do you mean by bad?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.643
(crackling, whooshing)

31:55.814 --> 31:56.848
(panting)

32:01.253 --> 32:02.154
(barking)

32:02.188 --> 32:04.556
See?

32:04.590 --> 32:05.791
Right.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.893
That was her favorite toy.

32:07.926 --> 32:08.961
Ooh.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.762
(ringtone plays)
My bad.

32:10.796 --> 32:11.597
(whines)

32:11.630 --> 32:12.764
Hello.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.600
Is this Marcos Diaz?
Uh-huh. Who's this?

32:14.633 --> 32:15.934
How'd you get this number?

32:15.968 --> 32:17.436
My name is Reed Strucker.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.406
My family needs help
getting across the border.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.408
You and the people
you work with,

32:22.441 --> 32:24.343
you do that, right?
Maybe.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.678
Did you hear
about the mutant incident?

32:26.712 --> 32:27.980
At the high school?

32:28.014 --> 32:30.282
Those were my kids.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.350
I'm sorry, I can't...

32:31.383 --> 32:32.918
I'm a prosecutor with the city.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.486
I was involved
with building a case

32:34.520 --> 32:35.754
against you and your associates

32:35.787 --> 32:36.955
for the district attorney's
office.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.957
And you're calling me for help?

32:38.991 --> 32:40.359
Now, why should I lift

32:40.392 --> 32:42.461
a finger for you?

32:42.494 --> 32:44.263
Because I can help you--
your, uh,

32:44.296 --> 32:46.165
your associate...

32:46.198 --> 32:47.533
Lorna Dane-- goes by Polaris.

32:47.566 --> 32:48.767
What do you know about Lorna?

32:48.800 --> 32:52.038
You want to help her?
You can talk to me.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.705
You know about
her medical situation?

32:53.739 --> 32:56.642
What are you talking about?
What medical situation?

32:56.675 --> 32:57.776
You gonna help my family?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.378
What are you talking about?

32:59.411 --> 33:00.312
I want a meeting.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.380
Yes. Fine.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.848
I'll meet you--
just...

33:02.881 --> 33:04.883
tell me.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.920
She's pregnant.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.501
Morning.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.070
Did you get any sleep?

33:24.103 --> 33:26.138
Some. But I think you
might be a mutant, too,

33:26.172 --> 33:28.440
with some sort of
snoring ability.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.812
This meeting, later,

33:33.845 --> 33:35.681
with the person,

33:35.714 --> 33:39.585
you... you think
it might work?

33:39.618 --> 33:41.487
Maybe.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.988
We don't have many options.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.691
I know you're doing
the best you can.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.127
I'll take one
option over none.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.033
Did you know it
was like this?

33:55.067 --> 33:57.103
For the mutants?

33:58.304 --> 34:00.306
I knew it wasn't easy.

34:02.574 --> 34:05.777
You remember how it was.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.446
The mutants
fighting each other

34:07.479 --> 34:08.880
and innocent people
getting hurt,

34:08.914 --> 34:11.383
dying.
People wanted something done.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.185
Well, they got
what they wanted.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.886
(sighs)

34:14.920 --> 34:16.922
We got to figure out something

34:16.955 --> 34:18.924
for breakfast...
What?

34:18.957 --> 34:21.026
REED:
We need to go, now.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.394
What is that thing?

34:22.428 --> 34:23.762
Sentinel Services drone.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.764
It's searching
the neighborhood.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.100
It can't see us
in here, can it?
It's the car, Cait.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.801
They know the car, they
know the license plate.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.037
Kids.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.939
Kids, get up.
Mom, what's-what's happening?

34:33.972 --> 34:36.142
We got to get out of here.
Get your stuff.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.143
Let's go.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.810
Gonna have to move quickly.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.647
Where are we going?
We got to stay out of sight.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.815
With that thing
in the air?
In a moment they're gonna find

34:43.849 --> 34:45.884
the car.
We have to get out of here.
Mom.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.553
Dad. The truck.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.355
Lauren, wait!

34:51.423 --> 34:53.292
Whoa.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.028
Dad. Dad, we got to go!

35:05.771 --> 35:07.773
What the hell?

35:20.719 --> 35:22.020
(indistinct conversations)

35:22.053 --> 35:25.023
* Baby, do you understand
me now *

35:25.056 --> 35:27.793
* Sometimes I feel
a little mad *
(footsteps approaching)

35:27.826 --> 35:31.129
Here you go.
* But don't you know
that no one alive *

35:31.163 --> 35:33.765
* Can always be an angel

35:33.799 --> 35:38.170
* When things go wrong,
I seem to be bad *

35:38.204 --> 35:41.540
* But I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good *

35:41.573 --> 35:45.511
* Oh, Lord, please
don't let me be misunderstood *

35:50.749 --> 35:52.684
Sit.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.220
* Baby...

35:55.854 --> 35:57.189
Just so we get this
out of the way--

35:57.223 --> 35:58.724
if this is a setup,
and cops are gonna be

35:58.757 --> 35:59.958
coming through that door...
It's not a setup.

35:59.991 --> 36:00.959
I'm alone.
No one's coming.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.561
Good.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.597
'Cause things in here
get real hot, real fast.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.203
Tell me about Lorna.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.373
She's in a
detainment center.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.674
What detainment center?

36:15.707 --> 36:17.743
Until my fam...

36:17.776 --> 36:20.579
What detainment center?
Where?

36:20.612 --> 36:24.115
The main detention
facility in Garland.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.018
And the baby?

36:27.052 --> 36:28.720
All I know is, she's pregnant.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.722
Is it okay?

36:30.756 --> 36:32.491
Is it healthy?

36:32.524 --> 36:34.493
Please.
It's my kid.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.528
All I saw was the medical
exam they gave her

36:36.562 --> 36:39.698
when they brought her in.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.234
Those are all the questions
I'm answering for now.

36:42.268 --> 36:45.337
Any other information
is yours,

36:45.371 --> 36:47.873
but only if my
family is safe.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.417
Bring everyone
to this location tonight.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.086
How much is this gonna cost?

37:01.119 --> 37:02.588
I don't want your money.

37:02.621 --> 37:03.889
The deal is this:

37:03.922 --> 37:05.691
Your family goes tonight.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.726
You?

37:07.759 --> 37:10.128
You stay behind with me
until I get Lorna back.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.798
* Yes, I'm just a soul
whose intentions *

37:12.831 --> 37:14.600
* Are good, oh, Lord...

37:24.676 --> 37:26.878
(sighs)

37:26.912 --> 37:28.414
See?
(squeaks)

37:28.447 --> 37:29.415
(panting)

37:29.448 --> 37:30.782
All fixed.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.457
(indistinct conversations)

37:42.294 --> 37:44.262
JOHN: Don't want
anyone else brought into here,

37:44.296 --> 37:46.264
so anything along
the river is fine.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.667
Here. Just...

37:48.700 --> 37:50.702
do what you can, okay?

37:52.137 --> 37:53.238
Something wrong?

37:53.271 --> 37:54.340
I need to talk to you.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.474
It's about Marcos.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.675
(chuckles)

37:56.708 --> 37:59.010
Uh, listen...

37:59.044 --> 38:02.080
Marcos is, uh...
he's an emotional guy.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.316
So, whatever he said,
don't take it personal.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.818
No, it's not about that.
It's...

38:06.852 --> 38:08.587
He got a phone call
from some guy.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.088
Something about
helping a family.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.823
He ran off
about an hour ago.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.325
Alone.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.694
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

38:15.727 --> 38:17.663
Because he
told me not to,

38:17.696 --> 38:19.531
and he didn't want
to get anyone else involved

38:19.565 --> 38:21.333
because it was dangerous.

38:21.367 --> 38:24.803
But then I was thinking about
how I owe his girlfriend.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.271
And she'd be pissed if he died.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.607
(sighs)
Come on.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.776
Well... where...
where are we going?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.277
We don't even
know where he is.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.779
I found you.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.581
Trust me, I can find him.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.420
*

38:57.268 --> 38:59.738
(sighs) Where'd
you get this car?

38:59.771 --> 39:03.074
There's, like,
sticky stuff all over.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.876
Are you serious right now?

39:04.910 --> 39:06.578
What? There's, like,
juice or something.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.580
What do you want me to do?
I liked the truck better.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.682
LAUREN: The truck was stolen,
dumbass. Are you brain damaged?

39:10.716 --> 39:13.351
You like the car so much,
you sit on the sticky part!
Fine.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.353
Okay, can we not do this now?

39:15.387 --> 39:17.523
Please?

39:24.530 --> 39:27.466
REED:
We're here.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.891
This everyone?
Yeah, we're all here.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.026
I want to know
what happens now.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.463
We get everyone supplies--
food, water, blankets--

39:57.496 --> 39:59.064
then we head
down to the border.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.299
And you can drive us across?

40:01.332 --> 40:03.101
Policía America's
all over the roads;

40:03.134 --> 40:05.403
you might as well go straight
to jail. Now come on.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.038
We're not going anywhere
until I know

40:07.072 --> 40:08.640
what's happening to my family.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.910
Look...

40:11.943 --> 40:13.745
we know people
down there with...

40:13.779 --> 40:15.481
skills.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.649
They track for mutants,
but we still got tricks

40:17.683 --> 40:20.251
they don't know. Mostly,
we get people under the wall.

40:20.285 --> 40:21.787
Sometimes over,
sometimes even through.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.321
And then, after that?

40:23.354 --> 40:25.924
We get you new names, new IDs.
There are churches,

40:25.957 --> 40:27.593
families that can help you...
(distant rustling)

40:30.295 --> 40:31.497
What? What is it?

40:33.364 --> 40:34.633
Does anyone know you're here?

40:34.666 --> 40:36.602
No, we didn't say anything.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.236
Did you tell someone
you were coming? Use a computer?

40:38.269 --> 40:40.171
The phone
that you called me on?
When I called you,

40:40.205 --> 40:41.840
I used a new SIM card.
There's no way...
(siren chirps)

40:41.873 --> 40:44.009
Looks like they
found a way.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.684
(police radio chatter)

40:57.489 --> 40:59.290
This is the Sentinel Services.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.759
Get on the ground.

41:00.792 --> 41:01.793
Put your hands
on your heads.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.095
If you try to flee or resist,

41:04.129 --> 41:06.097
we will use deadly force.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.134
Dad, what do we do?
There's nothing we can do.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.936
There must me something...
We can talk to them.
Talk?

41:10.969 --> 41:13.104
Yeah, no, we're
way past that.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.841
You have no idea
what they have in that car.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.343
I want to speak to an attorney.

41:18.376 --> 41:19.878
That is a bad idea.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.780
We will only negotiate
if one is provided.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.515
There will be no negotiation.

41:23.549 --> 41:25.517
Get your asses
on the ground now!

41:25.551 --> 41:27.686
We are Americans.
We have rights.

41:27.719 --> 41:30.121
You can discuss that with
a judge, Mr. Strucker. Right now

41:30.155 --> 41:32.290
you need to think about
what's best for your family.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.159
(loud thump)

41:35.594 --> 41:36.895
Dad?

41:36.928 --> 41:39.030
(grunts)

41:39.064 --> 41:40.331
Come on!

41:40.365 --> 41:41.900
Go! Go, now!
Go! Go! Go!

41:41.933 --> 41:43.201
(exclaims)

41:47.238 --> 41:48.506
Damn it.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.375
Deploy the weapon, sir?

42:08.760 --> 42:11.529
They're coming! That way!
Go! To the hallway!

42:17.603 --> 42:18.570
(electronic chittering)

42:18.604 --> 42:19.905
(grunts)

42:21.372 --> 42:22.774
Get up!
Go!

42:25.476 --> 42:27.212
(grunts)

42:31.049 --> 42:32.918

42:43.929 --> 42:45.263
What?

42:46.632 --> 42:48.399

43:02.914 --> 43:04.149
(electronic chittering)

43:04.916 --> 43:06.217

43:06.251 --> 43:07.953
Go. Go! Go!

43:16.995 --> 43:18.630
JOHN:
Watch out.

43:18.664 --> 43:20.165
(grunting)

43:23.368 --> 43:25.370
(electronic whining, shrieking)

43:32.678 --> 43:34.145
Remote unit to targeting.

43:36.547 --> 43:38.449
This way.

43:38.483 --> 43:40.251
They're on the other side.

43:40.285 --> 43:42.253
They're on the other side.
Here they come!

43:42.287 --> 43:43.955
(grunting)

43:48.660 --> 43:50.461
Clarice, you got to get us
out of here.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.864
What do you mean?
You got yourself
out of the prison,

43:52.898 --> 43:54.465
you can get us out of here!
No, it's different.
I can't see where I'm going.

43:54.499 --> 43:56.434
It's too dangerous.
All right, well, we will die

43:56.467 --> 43:58.203
if we stay here,
so can you please just do it?

43:58.236 --> 44:00.538
LAUREN: (grunts)
They're getting through!

44:04.242 --> 44:05.576
(grunting)

44:07.045 --> 44:08.947
I can't do it.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.315
JOHN:
Yes, you can!
I can't!

44:10.348 --> 44:11.717
What is that?

44:11.750 --> 44:14.485
(grunting): Go! Hurry!

44:18.189 --> 44:19.324
JOHN:
Come on! It's safe!

Come on!

44:44.015 --> 44:45.884

44:45.917 --> 44:48.253
Dad!
No!

44:48.286 --> 44:51.222
ANDY: Dad!
LAUREN: No, please...

44:51.256 --> 44:52.590
(grunts)
I can't hold it!

44:52.623 --> 44:53.925
LAUREN: No!
CAITLIN: Get out of there!

44:53.959 --> 44:55.293
ANDY:
Dad!

44:56.027 --> 44:57.595
No...

44:57.628 --> 44:59.297

No!

No. No.
