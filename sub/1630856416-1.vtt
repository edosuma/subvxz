-Sorry, we can't be late!

01:36.680 --> 01:39.265
-Didn't Professor Ambrose advise
you to skip class this week?

01:39.307 --> 01:41.184
-Yeah, I just can't
sit around and do nothing.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.727
-He's not gonna be found guilty.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.355
Case, at worst,
your brother's a thief.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.233
-She's not.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.276
-I was up all night,
but I've got a plan.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.278
Look, if he's convicted
of second-degree murder,

01:52.320 --> 01:54.280
there's only two ways
to shorten a life sentence.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.324
Through the governor,
upon unanimous recommendation

01:56.366 --> 01:58.785
by the board of pardons,
or an exoneration.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.413
-We can cross that bridge
if and when we get there.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.540
-PJ, after dark clouds
come rainbows.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.624
Start talking.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.459
-In my year of being
a court intern,

02:06.501 --> 02:08.670
precedent shows the odds
of an exoneration or a pardon

02:08.712 --> 02:09.921
are extremely low.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.382
But not impossible.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.467
Casey, this is why
hypothetical bridges are bad.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.511
Now you're sad!
-No, no, I'm not sad.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.305
Look, thank you
for being honest.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.890
And thank you both
for being here

02:20.932 --> 02:22.017
and all of the support.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.144
I could not have done it
without you.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.187
It's much appreciated.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.689
-I'm just an intern,

02:27.731 --> 02:29.566
standing in front of
a worried sister, asking her--

02:29.607 --> 02:31.568
-Wait, are you quoting
Notting Hill right now?

02:31.609 --> 02:33.695
-What? No.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.030
Okay, yes.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.282
-I love Notting Hill.
-See? Thank you!

PROFESSOR AMBROSE: The
protections of due process

02:38.950 --> 02:41.161
can be further understood
in what two categories?

02:41.202 --> 02:44.205
Jared?
-Procedural due process and...

02:44.247 --> 02:46.499
-Sarah?
-Substantive due process.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.376
Which ensures that laws
and actions are what?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.003
Tamara?
-Fair and reasonable.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.005
Because our rights
should not be infringed.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.507
AMBROSE: Haven't opened the
floor to commentary, Mr. Flint,

02:54.549 --> 02:57.010
but since you are
so eager to participate,

02:57.052 --> 02:59.262
enlighten us
on some of the errors

02:59.304 --> 03:01.097
that can lead to prejudice
against a defendant.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.599
-Flaws in lab procedures,

03:02.640 --> 03:04.934
inaccurate
or miscalculated DNA testing,

03:04.976 --> 03:07.729
and overall fraud
and human error.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.022
-Human error.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.023
-[in a whisper]
Little show-off.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.691
AMBROSE: Yes.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.736
Now, this is where theory
gets convoluted by practice,

03:14.778 --> 03:18.031
which can compromise
an otherwise fair proceeding.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.367
Now the floor is open.

03:20.408 --> 03:23.745
ELI: What about the act
of second-degree murder?

03:23.787 --> 03:27.248
Let's say in the case of,
I don't know, a robbery.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.500
-[scoffs]
Unreal.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.669
-How does due process
apply to that?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.379
-And what if the robbery
was committed

03:32.420 --> 03:34.047
after the victim
was already dead?

03:34.089 --> 03:36.007
-Regardless of the nature
of the offence,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.718
doesn't the law apply equally
to everyone involved?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.970
For instance, isn't
the sentence life in prison

03:41.012 --> 03:42.389
without
the possibility of parole?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.099
-And what if the defendant
was only convicted

03:44.140 --> 03:45.517
because of human error?

03:45.558 --> 03:47.394
I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't
want an innocent man

03:47.435 --> 03:49.562
to go to prison
for the rest of their lives

03:49.604 --> 03:51.064
for something they didn't do,
would you?

03:51.106 --> 03:54.651
Or maybe you actually would.

03:54.693 --> 03:58.530
AMBROSE: While I appreciate
a hearty debate,

03:58.571 --> 04:00.657
we've gotten a little
ahead of ourselves.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.910
Wrongful conviction will be
the focus in the next few weeks.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.370
That is class.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.247
Mr. Flint, Ms. Barlowe,
please come to the front.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.582
-We'll wait for you.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.501
-I swear...

04:11.543 --> 04:13.670
AMBROSE: Look, I know
you both are going through

04:13.712 --> 04:15.630
some incredibly
hard things right now.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.215
-He started it.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.427
-Wow, with an opening like that,
good luck ever winning a case.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.512
You know, I could argue
that your brother started it

04:22.554 --> 04:23.763
by killing my girlfriend.
-Okay--

04:23.805 --> 04:25.682
-You don't know anything
about my brother!

04:25.724 --> 04:27.267
Or about me.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.394
You are a spoiled brat who's had
every single thing handed to him

04:29.436 --> 04:31.438
his whole life and has
never had a single hardship

04:31.479 --> 04:34.357
for a single day, ever.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.609
-Now, that's a better opening.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.486
AMBROSE: Whether her brother
did this to Devina or not,

04:38.528 --> 04:39.904
it is not Casey's fault.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.448
Devina was her friend,

04:41.489 --> 04:44.951
and she could also be
losing her brother.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.453
And he is in grief.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.748
I know you can relate.

04:49.789 --> 04:54.419
Look, I hate that you are both
going through this right now,

04:54.461 --> 04:57.297
and I am here for you,
whatever you need.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.091
But you can't
bring it into my class,

05:00.133 --> 05:01.968
or I'll ask you to leave, okay?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.595
-Of course.
-Fine.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.556
Eli, you can go.
Casey, please stay.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.104
-[sighs]

05:13.146 --> 05:14.314
-"He started it"?

05:14.356 --> 05:16.316
-I'm sorry, Professor Ambrose.
I just, I...

05:16.358 --> 05:18.735
-No, it's okay.
It's okay.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.154
-I shouldn't have engaged.
-It's okay.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.531
-[sighs]
-How are you doing?

05:23.573 --> 05:26.034
-Bracing for the worst, and...

05:26.076 --> 05:26.868
trying to hope for the best.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.330
Yeah.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.415
-The jury's deliberating
right now, so, um...

05:32.457 --> 05:34.501
-Length of deliberation
isn't necessarily

05:34.542 --> 05:36.753
a good or bad sign
for either side.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.801
Do you think what
Theodore Parker said was right?

05:42.842 --> 05:46.513
Does the moral arc of the
universe bend toward justice?

05:46.554 --> 05:49.516
-Well, my next class
starts in 11 minutes,

05:49.557 --> 05:51.601
and that is not near
enough time to have

05:51.643 --> 05:54.646
the "Do we live in
a just society" conversation.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.064
-Yeah.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.650
-But I meant
what I said earlier.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.736
Whether you need to talk
or just miss a few classes,

06:01.778 --> 06:03.029
I'm here.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.698
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.533
-Hey...
Hey, are you okay?

06:06.574 --> 06:08.368
-I am so sorry
that happened to you.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.911
-Someone needs to put
a muzzle on that guy,

06:09.953 --> 06:11.996
and I would love
that someone to be me.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.415
-Hey, it's okay.
He believes

06:13.456 --> 06:14.499
that my brother murdered
his girlfriend.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.583
I would be mad too.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.168
-I feel like you need a hug.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.587
-Oh, okay-- oh, it's happening,
okay, we're hugging.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.715
-No, I need to hug you
for at least 30 seconds

06:21.756 --> 06:23.299
to calm your sympathetic
nervous system.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.676

-[phone buzzing]

-My phone's ringing.

-Yeah, sorry.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.557
[phone buzzing]

06:30.598 --> 06:32.517
It's the public defender.

I'll-- I'll be right there.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.574
Um...

06:47.615 --> 06:50.910
The jury is back,
and Marcus is not doing well,

06:50.952 --> 06:52.954
so I need to go
to the courthouse.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.414
-Um, I'm heading there now.
I'll take you.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.707
-I'm going with you.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.334
-Seriously, I feel like
I'm gonna vomit.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.252
-It's okay,
I've got a bag in my car.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.086
-Okay, breathe.
It's okay.

get me out of here.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.427
-Marcus...
-I can't!

07:07.469 --> 07:09.179
Marcus, can we please sit down
and talk about this

07:09.220 --> 07:10.638
for a minute?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.265
-I didn't do this,
and they're gonna put me away

07:12.307 --> 07:13.850
for the rest of my life,
I know it!

07:13.892 --> 07:15.518
-No, no, we don't know
anything yet, Marcus.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.895
I mean it.
Listen, listen.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.646
Hey, hey...
Hi.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.607
Hey, hey,
it's okay, it's okay.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.317
Look, just breathe.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.318
-Oh...
-Look at me.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.611
Breathe.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.613
We don't know
anything yet, okay?

07:26.654 --> 07:27.947
I need you to calm down.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.909
You can't go back out there
like this, okay?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.160
So, come on.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.037
Can you please just come here?
Come with me.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.956
Sit down, sit down.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.458
It's okay.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.450
I know you didn't do this.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.120

turn it all around.

Did you get my messages?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.861
-I did.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.198
Frank, I'm sorry.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.408
I wish there was something
I could do to bring Devina back.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.410
I... I don't even
know what to say.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.580
I-I can't even imagine what sort
of pain you're in right now.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.624
-I brought you into our family
after your mom died

09:42.665 --> 09:44.584
when you and Devina
became friends.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.795
I treated you
like one of my own.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.963
I told you to walk away
from your brother.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.632
-I know.
I'm sorry, I couldn't.

09:50.674 --> 09:54.552
He's... the only family I have.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.596
That would be the hardest thing
I could ever do.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.683
-Not harder
than burying your child.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.940
[sighs]

10:06.981 --> 10:11.111

10:11.152 --> 10:14.322
*

10:14.364 --> 10:17.409
*

10:17.450 --> 10:18.326
JUDGE: Thank you.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.539
*

10:22.580 --> 10:24.708
On the count of
second-degree murder,

10:24.749 --> 10:27.877
we find the defendant,
Marcus Barlowe...

10:27.919 --> 10:29.212
guilty.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.756
I hereby sentence the defendant
to life in prison

10:31.798 --> 10:33.341
without parole.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.385
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

10:35.427 --> 10:38.638
on behalf of myself
and the city of Philadelphia,

10:38.680 --> 10:41.683
I want to thank you
for the attention and time

10:41.725 --> 10:43.810
spent on this case.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.104
Your service is now concluded.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.731
You are discharged.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.191
All rise for the jury, please.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.071
CASEY: Hey, hey, hey.
Come here, come here.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.532
It's okay.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.659
It's okay.
Look, I promise you.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.078
I promise you this is
not how it's gonna end.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.163
I got you.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.124
Remember,
I will get you out of this.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.375
It's gonna be okay.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.377
I love you.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.505
I love you.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.925
It's gonna be fine.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.385
[tearfully]
I love you.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.348
[sombre music]

11:21.389 --> 11:26.853
*

11:26.895 --> 11:30.065
[in a whisper] Eli could
look a little less pleased.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.526
CASEY: Okay, this is why
I always stay ten steps ahead.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.070
I mean, what do we even do now?

11:35.111 --> 11:37.197
Do we ask the public defender
to file an appeal?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.783
-Uh, if we ask the public
defender, it'll take forever.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.993
Like, years.
We gotta do this ourselves.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.079
-You don't have to do anything.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.830
You've done enough, okay?
This is my brother's case.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.248
This is my fight.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.125
SARAH: Case...
Case, I know you don't like

11:49.167 --> 11:52.253
asking for help, but... if there
was ever a time, this is it.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.381
Please.
Let us help you.

11:54.422 --> 11:59.219
*

11:59.260 --> 12:00.595
Okay.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.055
Okay, what are our next steps?

12:02.097 --> 12:04.557
-Alright, um...
if we're looking to exonerate,

12:04.599 --> 12:05.850
we gotta find new evidence.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.227
-They must have
missed something.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.437
An item of clothing
they forgot to test,

12:09.479 --> 12:11.564
blood, hair, fingerprints...

12:11.606 --> 12:13.441
-I need to get the discovery.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.734
It'll be released

12:14.776 --> 12:16.027
now that Marcus has
been sentenced, right?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.029
-Right, but I can get it
faster than you.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.864
So, text me your address,
I'll meet you there,

12:19.906 --> 12:21.074
and we'll pore through
every page.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.826
-Thank you, you legal angel.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.869
Alright, let's go do this.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.083
[ambient city sounds]

12:30.125 --> 12:31.793
CASEY: "I checked
her pulse and breath.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.628
"Should have called the police,
but with my record,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.130
"I was scared
they'd think I'd killed her.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.257
"Felt sick to my stomach,
but I needed the money.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.551
"The necklace was there
and she was already dead,

12:39.592 --> 12:40.927
"so I took it."

12:40.969 --> 12:42.679
-How long were you and Devina
friends for?

12:42.721 --> 12:44.305
-Since, um,
first day of undergrad.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.598
All three of us, actually.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.809
-And then Case and I
went to law school,

12:47.851 --> 12:50.061
Devina came to a party with us,
met Eli,

12:50.103 --> 12:51.604
and started distancing
herself after that.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.148
-Yeah.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.191
-Ah, so that explains
the tension between you three.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.818
She left you for
the big man on campus.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.278
-Yeah, basically.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.405
-So, then, how did Marcus
not know Devina?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.365
-They never met.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.743
My mom died a couple months
before I went to college,

13:04.784 --> 13:07.120
and that's when Marcus started

13:07.162 --> 13:09.664
pushing me away
and getting into trouble.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.958
You know, breaking and entering,
shoplifting,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.752
public intoxication.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.211
-Gotcha.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.547
-Strangulation
is a crime of passion.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.674
It takes place between two
people in a close relationship.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.134
-Exactly.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.303
-So, besides Eli,
who was Devina hanging out with?

13:23.345 --> 13:24.888
-We don't actually know.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.973
She folded herself
into Eli's friend group.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.975
-And we were never invited
to hang out with that group.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.185
-Nope.
-Not that I wanted to.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.686
-In the last, what, six months,

13:31.728 --> 13:33.355
she hasn't returned
a single call or text.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.857
-Okay, so we need to figure out
who was in Devina's circle

13:35.899 --> 13:37.942
during that time.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.402
-Was Eli questioned?

13:39.444 --> 13:41.821
-Uh, I don't think so,
unless it was off the record.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.490
-Oh, oh, I can find that out.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.492
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.202
-Here's something.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.163
So, the bodega owner,
he was the one that confirmed

13:50.205 --> 13:53.917
he saw Marcus standing over
Devina's already-still body.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.835
-Which Marcus confirmed
in his statement.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.545
-He's the only eyewitness.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.589
-That doesn't prove murder
beyond a reasonable doubt.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.008
-Well, there's 12 jurors
that would say the opposite.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.259
-Yeah, but remember
what Ambrose said:

14:03.301 --> 14:04.886
even the most objective jurors

14:04.928 --> 14:07.180
will err on the side of
putting an innocent man away

14:07.222 --> 14:08.640
rather than letting
a murderer go free.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.850
-Yeah, it's true.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.977
-Who would have
done this to her?

14:16.481 --> 14:19.150
CASEY: Ah, Devina,
what were you doing?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.406
SARAH: Wait...

14:24.447 --> 14:26.241
That's odd.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.076
-What'd you find?

14:28.118 --> 14:30.286
-The only items tested
were Devina's phone,

14:30.328 --> 14:32.247
which only had her prints,
and the necklace,

14:32.288 --> 14:34.082
which carried Marcus's prints,

14:34.124 --> 14:37.127
which means that the item
Marcus knowingly took

14:37.168 --> 14:38.878
was the sole, real evidence
used to convict him.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.380
PJ: What?

14:40.422 --> 14:42.382
Everything on or around her
should have been tested.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.217
-If we could get our hands
on those items,

14:44.259 --> 14:45.969
do you think you could
test them for prints?

14:46.011 --> 14:48.263
-If the CSI lab caught me,
I would lose my internship.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.140
-Right.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.183
SARAH: But you're
my best friend.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.310
And, you know, justice.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.729
-Well, I would do it
fast, though,

14:55.770 --> 14:56.646
because anything
deemed extraneous

14:56.688 --> 14:57.897
will either be disposed of

14:57.939 --> 14:59.315
or returned
to Devina's next-of-kin.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.817
-Well, if Frank
gets a hold of it,

15:00.859 --> 15:02.652
we'll never see it again.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.405
-Oh, if only we knew an intern
at the public defender's office

15:05.447 --> 15:07.323
with access
to the police department

15:07.365 --> 15:09.617
where said evidence
is being held.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.703
-No, no, no, no...
-Yeah...

15:11.745 --> 15:14.581
-No!
-Oh, she's right.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.332
[Casey sighs]

15:16.374 --> 15:18.084
Do we have to?

15:18.126 --> 15:20.337
[ambient city sounds]

15:23.381 --> 15:24.632
Let me guess.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.176
You guys are
looking for a tutor.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.928
Sorry, my schedule
is indefinitely full.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.847
-Ugh, calm down.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.223
-I know you think
my brother's guilty.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.017
-I knowyour brother's guilty.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.102
-What if I were to tell you
there may be evidence

15:36.144 --> 15:37.687
to suggest the contrary?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.189
Evidence that wasn't properly
dusted for other prints

15:39.230 --> 15:40.982
or tested for a potential match?

15:41.024 --> 15:44.110
And yes, we read every
syllable of discovery.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.280
-The public defender's office
is swimming in cases.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.199
They don't have the luxury
of unlimited resources

15:49.240 --> 15:51.159
to spend on cases
that are clear.

15:51.201 --> 15:55.080
Marcus's was clear.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.290
-I wonder what your dad
will think when he finds out

15:57.332 --> 15:59.209
the office his son
committed himself to

15:59.250 --> 16:01.628
neglected to test
all the evidence.

16:01.670 --> 16:05.590
-Mm, that's a good point.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.009
-Why do you think
I would want to help you?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.428
-If you really loved Devina
the way you said you did,

16:10.470 --> 16:13.556
wouldn't you do everything in
your power to find her killer?

16:13.598 --> 16:17.519
*

16:17.560 --> 16:19.104
What do you need me to do?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.313
-Get us
the exculpatory evidence.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.981
- Possibleexculpatory evidence.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.109
-Fine.
Before they give it to Frank.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.195
I know you have the police
contacts and the access.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.156
-We'll test it at my lab,
and if we get a hit on AFIS--

16:30.198 --> 16:31.116
-I'll cross-reference
with criminal records

16:31.157 --> 16:32.492
and police reports.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.744
I can expedite any paperwork
through the court.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.497
-Hm.
This is quite the plan you have.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.332
-It certainly is.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.918
Are you in?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.712
[sighs]

16:46.715 --> 16:47.882
ELI: Hey-hey, what's up, Green?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.426
GREEN: Hey-hey, Flint!

16:50.635 --> 16:52.971
I hear congrats are in order.
Making sergeant.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.389
Next drink's on
the public defender's office.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.182
-You guys are too kind to us.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.269
Speaking of the PD's office,
I saw the DA on the news today.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.645
That Barlowe case,
it's crazy, huh?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.022
-Yeah, crazy.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.690
-Saw that kid in here
a few times.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.525
Hard to believe he's capable
of something like that.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.235
-Hey, uh, listen.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.196
I was actually hoping you could
do me a solid and release

17:10.238 --> 17:12.907
any of the victim's remaining
personal items to me.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.452
-Technically I'm only supposed
to release that to next-of-kin.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.371
-I know, but the public defender
wanted to extend a courtesy

17:18.413 --> 17:20.915
to the father,
get me to drop it off for him.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.543
More of a personal touch.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.587
Get that?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.469
CASEY: Did you get it?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.763
SARAH: Huh, playing games
with evidence now.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.973
-Oh, believe me,
this is no game.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.642
I'm not giving you this until I
know what you're doing with it.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.353
-We're gonna test
every item in that bag,

17:41.394 --> 17:42.979
and you're gonna help us.
-[Eli scoffs]

17:43.021 --> 17:44.647
Yeah, that's funny,
'cause I'm not.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.025
-If we find any prints
on any of those items

17:47.067 --> 17:48.401
that don't match Marcus,

17:48.443 --> 17:50.487
you're the first person
that we're gonna look to.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.238
CASEY: So,
you have a choice, Eli.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.699
You can work with us, and have
a chance to defend yourself,

17:54.741 --> 17:56.826
or you can go out on your own

17:56.868 --> 17:59.954
and let the chips and the prints
fall where they may.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.956
I think Choice A
is definitely the way.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.458
-Yeah.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.543
Got that.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.920
-Thank you.

18:06.961 --> 18:10.090
-Thank you so much.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.217
Meet us after class
at Sarah's lab?

18:15.804 --> 18:17.597
Well done, ladies.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.266
AMBROSE: Wrongful convictions
have increased 70%

18:20.308 --> 18:22.602
in the last five years,
and the current rate

18:22.644 --> 18:25.188
is as high as 10%
for indicted individuals

18:25.230 --> 18:27.065
who are actually innocent.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.067
But think about it:
fingerprints get lost;

18:29.109 --> 18:32.153
detectives, short on time,
overlook leads;

18:32.195 --> 18:34.447
faulty lab work;
and then the defence comes in

18:34.489 --> 18:36.741
after somebody
has already been arrested--

18:36.783 --> 18:37.867
they weren't at the scene;

18:37.909 --> 18:40.120
they're dependent
on law enforcement

18:40.161 --> 18:42.247
to preserve evidence
and then jurors

18:42.288 --> 18:43.998
to check their bias at the door.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.251
You see where
I'm going with this, right?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.087
Look, when people
enter the system,

18:49.129 --> 18:51.047
they do so with
the best of intentions.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.465
They really want to
make a difference,

18:52.507 --> 18:55.385
but at the end of the day,
the justice system

18:55.427 --> 18:59.055
is made up of human beings.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.516
And human beings
are not perfect.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.351
-PJ?
-Then what's the point?

19:03.393 --> 19:06.187
The point is
we don't stop trying.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.648
We don't stop fighting.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.693
Because human lives
are at stake.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.739
And you can't stop
believing that as well.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.574
That's class.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.578
ELI: You failed to mention
in your plan

19:21.619 --> 19:23.872
that you were going to test me.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.374
-Well, we're just dotting
the I's and crossing the T's.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.585
SARAH: You'd be surprised how
many guilty people follow along

19:28.626 --> 19:29.836
thinking they'll
never get caught.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.212
Ego is a strange thing.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.548
-And yours
is especially considerable.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.258
-For someone that
needed my help,

19:35.300 --> 19:37.302
you have an unusual way
of showing your gratitude.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.679
CASEY: And there's the ego.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.473
I'm sorry, are you
looking for a thank you?

19:41.514 --> 19:42.599
Is that what you're waiting on?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.225
-Yeah, that'd be nice.
-Hey, guys--

19:44.267 --> 19:46.269
-Because without me,
there'd be no evidence to test.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.521
Let me be clear,
I'm not doing this for you,

19:48.563 --> 19:50.273
or for Marcus.
Despite what you think,

19:50.315 --> 19:52.442
I don't want an innocent
person in prison.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.444
If there's a chance
that your brother didn't do it,

19:54.486 --> 19:55.987
we need to find out who did.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.238
-Oh, I agree.
-Guys...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.532
-Do I think you had
anything to do with this?

19:59.574 --> 20:01.076
No, I don't.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.370
But if it saves my brother,
I don't care if you get caught

20:03.411 --> 20:05.538
in the crossfire if we find out
who actually killed her.

20:05.580 --> 20:06.539
SARAH: Guys!

20:06.581 --> 20:07.791
I got prints.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.584
A clean set from her watch.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.586
I'm gonna compare them
to Marcus and Eli's prints.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.755
In about 20 minutes,
we will know if anyone else

20:13.797 --> 20:15.382
besides Marcus
could have been there

20:15.423 --> 20:17.008
the night Devina was murdered.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.019
ELI: I don't know what
you think you're gonna find.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.604
I have nothing to hide.
CASEY: Good.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.439
Then you wouldn't mind answering
some questions while we wait.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.024
-Ugh.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.526
-So, where were you
the night Devina was murdered?

20:34.567 --> 20:35.777
-Come on.
-Well, it's an easy question.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.487
You were either with her
or you weren't?

20:37.529 --> 20:39.572
-I wasn't with her.
-Great.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.574
So, uh, did you see her
at all that day?

20:41.616 --> 20:43.118
-I will not be
interrogated by you.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.328
-You two were known for being
on-again, off-again,

20:45.370 --> 20:46.871
so were you off... again?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.124
-My relationship with Devina
is none of your business.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.918
-I beg to differ.
-SARAH: Hey, you done yet?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.129
Ugh!
The results are in...

20:54.170 --> 20:58.341
The prints from Devina's watch
are not a match to you, Eli.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.218
[Eli exhales]

21:00.260 --> 21:02.929
Told ya.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.264
Now do you trust me?

21:06.182 --> 21:08.393
I'm sorry.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.312
Trust is tricky for me.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.274
Um, thank you for your help.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.739
What about Marcus?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.157
They're not a match
for him either.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.867
-Oh, thank goodness.
-But listen...

21:23.908 --> 21:25.076
All this tells us right now

21:25.118 --> 21:26.745
is that this is
a latent set of prints.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.038
This could still
lead to nothing.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.789
-Or it could lead to the killer.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.042
-Either way,
it's gonna take some time

21:32.083 --> 21:33.501
to match these sets
in the system.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.586
-Okay, how much time?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.087
-Three days.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.256
Maybe more.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.467
-Okay.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.802
What do we do in the meantime?

21:42.844 --> 21:45.638
-Hone in on a suspect
with the information we have.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.556
BOTH: PJ.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.934
CASEY: Go, go, go, go!

21:49.976 --> 21:51.478
-What?
-Just get in the corner!

21:51.519 --> 21:52.979
-What?
What are you doing?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.399
I just really don't want to see
DA Quinn right now, okay?

21:56.441 --> 21:57.984
-Why?

21:58.026 --> 21:59.861
'Cause you got something
stuck in your teeth?

21:59.903 --> 22:01.112
-Wait, do I?
-Yeah.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.447
-Oh...

22:05.492 --> 22:08.953
Okay.
Okay, funny man.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.955
Look, DA Quinn can't know
what we're doing

22:10.997 --> 22:12.582
until we have proof
of Marcus's innocence.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.417
-Right.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.961
So I shouldn't call out
after him, "Hey, DA Quinn, I--"

22:17.003 --> 22:19.547
-No, hey, hey, hey!
Not funny.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.966
And not helpful, okay?

22:27.013 --> 22:29.140
Okay, the coast is clear,
so we're just gonna...

22:29.182 --> 22:30.225
-Okay.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.102
[laughter]

22:32.143 --> 22:34.187
-You guys are so great.
I love talking to you!

22:34.229 --> 22:36.356
So, let me know how your
golf tournament goes, alright?

22:36.398 --> 22:38.775
And you gotta show me pictures
of your grandbabies,

22:38.817 --> 22:40.568
and I gotta hear about
your swim class, alright?

22:40.610 --> 22:41.778
-Uh, alright.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.946
-PJ, you're a masterpiece.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.781
-Ah, thank you.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.157
-ELI: Question for you.
-Yeah?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.617
-Can you quickly locate
criminal records

22:47.659 --> 22:48.827
similar to Devina's case?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.162
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but also on the down-low.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.580
-Wait...

22:52.622 --> 22:53.748
Something's different.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.500
-We just, uh...

22:55.542 --> 22:59.713
came to an understanding.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.589
-Can we just go find
the documents now?

23:01.631 --> 23:03.717
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come...

23:03.758 --> 23:04.843
What's an understanding?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.261
-It's an understanding.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.179
It's like when two people,
like, agree on a thing.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.515
So, aside from men with
a history of female assault,

23:10.557 --> 23:11.933
what else are we
looking for here?

23:11.975 --> 23:14.185
-Uh, strangulation
or attempted strangulation.

23:14.227 --> 23:17.022
-And add men who were released
by the time Devina was killed.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.149
-And women that were
bound with boat rope.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.608
PJ: Ah...
[murmurs indistinctly]

23:21.735 --> 23:23.111
I'm sorry.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.821
The discovery said
she was bound with boat rope.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.031
-No, don't be sorry.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.074
The details help
narrow the search.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.951
-Are you sure you're okay,
hearing all this?

23:29.993 --> 23:31.536
-Oh, now you're worried
about my feelings?

23:31.578 --> 23:32.412
-I'm just asking.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.539
-I'm fine.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.874
PJ: Bingo bango!

23:35.915 --> 23:36.875
Three names.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.710
ELI: John Lucas Bronson.

23:38.752 --> 23:41.629
-Never trust a man
with two first names.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.131
-Taylor Graham, no middle name.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.050
-Must have been a middle child.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.635
ELI: Matthew Alias Cane.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.095
CASEY: Alias?

23:49.137 --> 23:51.097
That's an interesting name.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.808
-So, all three fit our criteria,

23:53.850 --> 23:56.436
except none of them
used boat rope.

23:56.478 --> 24:00.231
-Well, we are off to
a sick and scary start.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.150
DA QUINN: Where's my
invite to the party?

24:07.572 --> 24:08.823
CASEY: I'm sorry, sir.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.158
I know I should have
come to you first.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.744
I found another set of prints.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.371
Can't tell you how I found it,

24:14.412 --> 24:15.914
but I promise
I'll explain everything--

24:15.955 --> 24:17.332
-Won't be necessary.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.418
For the record,
I don't condone it.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.836
-Of course not.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.255
Uh, and I wouldn't want
to jeopardize my internship

24:24.297 --> 24:25.799
with any conflict of interest--

24:25.840 --> 24:28.093
-I think what you should do
is just take some time off.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.095
-I don't need time, sir.
-It's not a punishment.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.930
It's just that you've
gone through a lot,

24:31.971 --> 24:35.058
and you need to
take care of yourself...

24:35.100 --> 24:39.938
and whatever else it is that
you guys are doing in there.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.898
-Understood.
-Yeah?

24:41.940 --> 24:43.900
-Thank you.

24:43.942 --> 24:46.319
-Yeah.

24:46.361 --> 24:51.825
Also, if my office were to
legally re-open Marcus's case,

24:51.866 --> 24:54.119
you and your
merry band of interns

24:54.160 --> 24:56.329
would need to produce
eyewitness testimony

24:56.371 --> 24:58.123
placing whoever
you think did this

24:58.164 --> 25:01.126
at the scene of Devina's crime.
Okay?

25:01.167 --> 25:05.839
Or better yet,
a full confession.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.882
-Understood.
-Good.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.718
I promise we are using
the utmost discretion.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.720
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
Just shh...

25:11.761 --> 25:12.804
Less is more, alright?

25:12.846 --> 25:14.055
-Oh.
-Yeah.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.974
-Yeah, okay, thank you.
-Yeah, you bet.

25:16.016 --> 25:17.267
ELI: Sarah, did you get that?

25:17.308 --> 25:20.645
It's John Lucas Bronson,
Matthew Alias Cane,

25:20.687 --> 25:21.813
and Taylor Graham.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.148
SARAH: [on phone]
Okay, got it.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.567
This just saved us hours,
possibly days.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.777
-We'll let you know if and when
we find these guys.

25:27.819 --> 25:28.778
Thank you, Sarah.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.030
-Okay, talk soon.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.450
Okay, so how are we
gonna find these guys?

25:33.491 --> 25:36.661
-Well, first of all,
are we in trouble?

25:36.703 --> 25:38.455
-No, I'm pretty sure

25:38.496 --> 25:40.874
DA Quinn just gave us
his unofficial blessing.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.334
-Oh.
-Nice.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.669
-Okay, sweet, well...
I know an off-the-record guy.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.046
He can track anyone down.

25:46.087 --> 25:47.756
I'll call him
and set something up?

25:47.797 --> 25:49.174
-Sounds great.
-Ah!

25:49.215 --> 25:51.426
We're like the Marvel Universe
of law students.

25:51.468 --> 25:52.844
ELI: Oh, man.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.054
-You know what that means?

25:54.095 --> 25:55.221
We need a name.

25:55.263 --> 25:56.306
-No...

25:56.348 --> 25:58.892
-What about Justice Warriors?

25:58.933 --> 25:59.934
-No.
-PJ...

25:59.976 --> 26:01.853
-Okay, okay, uh...

26:01.895 --> 26:03.229
Free Marcus?

26:03.271 --> 26:04.731
-We are not saying Free Marcus.
-Absolutely not.

26:04.773 --> 26:05.899
-Okay, okay.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.233
We'll brainstorm
something later.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.360
Just remember...
[phone buzzing]

26:08.401 --> 26:10.362
There's no "I" in "team," Eli.

26:10.403 --> 26:14.949
ELI: But there is an "I"
in "Eli."

26:14.991 --> 26:17.452
-This is Casey Barlowe.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.621
Yes.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.748
Okay, um...

26:21.790 --> 26:23.458
Yeah, I'll--
I'll be right there.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.127
Uh, are you okay?

26:26.169 --> 26:28.672
-I have to go see my brother.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.926
[buzzer]

26:32.967 --> 26:34.803
CASEY: Are you eating?

26:34.844 --> 26:36.721
I know the food's
probably terrible,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.139
but I need you to try.

do not apologize to me, okay?

26:54.322 --> 26:56.825
Come on, I'm here for you.

need from your place?

27:07.669 --> 27:08.920
-Okay.

27:08.962 --> 27:10.922
-And if you could
pick me up some earplugs.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.257
-Yeah, absolutely.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.217
I'll do what I can.
Anything else?

27:14.259 --> 27:18.096
-Uh, anything... you find
that might make this place

27:18.138 --> 27:19.848

-I, um...

I'm gonna need you to hold on
just a little bit longer, okay?

her boyfriend or husband.

but you never know these days.

31:54.664 --> 31:55.623

this information.

Okay, so what
do we do with it now?

who this guy is

with Devina's murder.

32:02.589 --> 32:03.923

seeing him romantically?

seeing him professionally.

something to investigators.

So, how do we break the news?

office, though, after class.

physical evidence in discovery

of confidence?

33:21.668 --> 33:23.378
-100%.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.255
It's a set of latent prints
lifted off of Devina's watch.

33:25.296 --> 33:26.715
-Hm, those could be anyone's.

33:26.756 --> 33:30.218
-True, but what if I told you
that Devina may have been

33:30.260 --> 33:32.512
in a relationship
with an older man?

33:32.554 --> 33:34.055
-Continue.

33:34.097 --> 33:36.307
-The same eyewitness that ID'd
Marcus at the crime scene

33:36.349 --> 33:38.810
was able to say he'd seen Devina
with this man several times.

33:38.852 --> 33:41.312
He ID'd the vehicle and said
he was a new property developer

33:41.354 --> 33:43.189

down the street.

You know, it's really strange,
the last six months,

Devina just quit returning
my calls and texts.

35:21.996 --> 35:24.916
-She told me the opposite:
that when we started dating,

35:24.958 --> 35:26.668
you stopped wanting
to hang out with her.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.963
-What? No, that...
That's not my way.

35:30.005 --> 35:32.632
-Devina, she had a way
with the truth.

35:32.674 --> 35:34.968
-Sort of makes you
wonder what else

she might have been hiding,
you know?

he always wanted to be.

Got released early, even started
a weekly support group.

On Wednesday nights
you can actually find him

talking to other inmates,

can turn things around.

36:05.832 --> 36:08.251
[phone beeping]

36:08.293 --> 36:10.003
Excuse me, one sec.

36:10.045 --> 36:11.212
Hey...

36:11.254 --> 36:13.173
-It wasn't Taylor.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.383
Devina's body was found
on a Wednesday night.

36:15.425 --> 36:18.845
*

36:18.887 --> 36:20.889
CASEY: Liam had
the brilliant idea to check

36:20.930 --> 36:23.183
the security camera footage
from the prison community room

36:23.224 --> 36:24.684
the night Devina died.

36:24.726 --> 36:26.019
LIAM: Yeah, Taylor Graham
was definitely present.

36:26.061 --> 36:27.604
He was running a support group

36:27.645 --> 36:29.147
the exact same time
Devina was killed.

36:29.189 --> 36:32.359
CASEY: So it definitely
can't be him.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.402
-Lab analysis confirms
that Matt Cane's prints

36:34.444 --> 36:37.197
from Liam's hood
are not a match.

36:37.238 --> 36:40.116
LIAM: And two-first-name guy
over there is dead.

36:40.158 --> 36:41.951
PS, never trust a guy
with two first names.

36:41.993 --> 36:43.953
-I literally said
the same thing!

36:43.995 --> 36:47.415
-So we're at a total dead end.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.587
LIAM: Uh, what is this...

36:52.629 --> 36:53.963
going on between you two?

36:54.005 --> 36:56.675
-Uh, there was
nothing between us.

36:56.716 --> 36:58.218
-Okay, you guys are amateurs.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.845
You just looked at her, trying
to get her to say something,

37:00.887 --> 37:02.722
and then you just shook
your head back at her, so...

37:02.764 --> 37:04.224
What's the deal?

37:04.265 --> 37:05.767
You guys gonna share
with the rest of the group,

37:05.809 --> 37:07.060
or am I walking out of here?

37:07.102 --> 37:10.271
'Cause I don't work like that.

37:11.106 --> 37:13.733
Devina was seeing another man.

37:13.775 --> 37:15.360
-Oh.
-The question is...

37:15.402 --> 37:17.404
Did you know?

37:18.488 --> 37:20.031
CASEY: Eli!

37:20.073 --> 37:22.033
Eli, wait!

37:22.075 --> 37:22.992
Eli!

37:23.034 --> 37:24.119
-That was messed up in there,

37:24.160 --> 37:25.537
putting me on the spot
like that!

37:25.578 --> 37:28.123
-I know, okay, I know, I know,
the timing was bad, yes.

37:28.164 --> 37:30.834
I know, but it was
a fair question.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.794
Did you know?

37:35.463 --> 37:37.465
We're gonna find out.

37:37.507 --> 37:39.384
I won't stop.

37:39.426 --> 37:41.761
It'd just be a lot easier
if you'd help us.

37:41.803 --> 37:46.558
[poignant music]

37:46.599 --> 37:52.564
*

37:52.605 --> 37:56.901
*

37:56.943 --> 37:58.153
SARAH: You're home.

37:58.194 --> 37:59.654
CASEY: Yeah, I had to
take a walk,

37:59.696 --> 38:00.655
clear my head.

38:00.697 --> 38:02.323
-Did it help?

38:05.618 --> 38:06.786
Eli knew.

38:06.828 --> 38:08.204
-Is that what he said?

38:08.246 --> 38:10.498
-No, but his silence
spoke volumes.

38:13.043 --> 38:14.878
I'm sorry.
I know you're disappointed.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.088
He's been a conflict of interest
from the start,

38:17.130 --> 38:19.007
and now
he's a flat-out liability.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.759
-Yeah, but it still wasn't
the time or the place

38:20.800 --> 38:21.843
to confront him.

38:21.885 --> 38:23.386
Not in front of everyone.

38:23.428 --> 38:26.681
And it wasn't your
information to tell.

38:26.723 --> 38:29.392
-We deserve to know the truth.

38:29.434 --> 38:31.019
We're all invested in this.

38:31.061 --> 38:34.439
Look, I've put my internship
on the line, Case!

38:34.481 --> 38:36.149
So has PJ.
So have you!

38:36.191 --> 38:37.609
-So did Eli.

38:37.650 --> 38:38.985
Or he was, anyway.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.820
-You don't think he'll be back?

38:40.862 --> 38:43.239
-I don't know.

38:43.281 --> 38:45.658
But I know if I had
just had one more chance

38:45.700 --> 38:47.202
to talk to him one-on-one,

38:47.243 --> 38:49.662
I believe he would have told me.

38:49.704 --> 38:51.373
-I'm sorry.

38:52.957 --> 38:55.335
I got you a glass.

38:55.377 --> 39:00.423
*

39:00.465 --> 39:03.593
Should I just put Eli's picture
on the board, you know?

39:03.635 --> 39:04.636
Okay.

39:09.724 --> 39:10.809
FRANK: Case.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.185
-Frank, hi.

39:12.227 --> 39:14.104
Uh, you know, I'm just
running between classes.

39:14.145 --> 39:15.605
-I-I...

39:15.647 --> 39:17.190
I just want to apologize
for the way

39:17.232 --> 39:18.483
that I treated you
at the courthouse.

39:18.525 --> 39:21.152
-Hey, Frank,
you don't need to apologize.

39:21.194 --> 39:23.029
That was not the time
to approach you.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.198
-I know how much
you loved Devina too.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.742
And I'm sorry.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.869
-I do.

39:29.911 --> 39:31.204
Thank you for saying that.
That...

39:31.246 --> 39:32.997
That means a lot.
I appreciate it.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.416
-I took my anger out on you.

39:34.457 --> 39:35.750
You're not your brother.

39:35.792 --> 39:39.129
You're nothing like him.

39:39.170 --> 39:42.841
I miss her more than I can say.

39:42.882 --> 39:44.801
-I miss her too.

39:44.843 --> 39:48.430
She was my best friend.

39:48.471 --> 39:51.307
I don't know if you were aware,
but she hadn't been answering

39:51.349 --> 39:53.893
my texts or calls
for quite a while.

39:53.935 --> 39:57.355
It was almost as if there
was something that she

39:57.397 --> 39:59.566
maybe wasn't comfortable
talking with me about.

39:59.607 --> 40:01.735
I don't know, did she ever
mention anything to you?

40:01.776 --> 40:03.069
-No.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.904
Never mentioned anything.

40:04.946 --> 40:07.991
-Did I do something
to upset her?

40:08.033 --> 40:10.076
Or was there something
going on with Eli, maybe,

40:10.118 --> 40:11.494
or with someone else?
-Doesn't matter.

40:11.536 --> 40:15.623
Whatever was going on with her
won't bring her back.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.208
Anyway, um...

40:19.085 --> 40:20.628
Again, I'm sorry.

40:23.840 --> 40:27.093
AMBROSE: Next week, we are
gonna hone in on the obstacles

40:27.135 --> 40:29.054
that are up against the accused.

40:29.095 --> 40:31.264
-Is he just gonna ignore us
for the rest of second year?

40:31.306 --> 40:32.932
-Looks that way.

40:32.974 --> 40:35.518
AMBROSE: ...and at every point,
we have to adhere

40:35.560 --> 40:38.438
to the firm foundations
of the Constitution.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.481
That's class.

40:40.648 --> 40:41.775
Off to the lab.

40:41.816 --> 40:43.401
-And I gotta get
to the courthouse.

40:43.443 --> 40:45.862
-I'll check in with Liam, see
if he has anything new for us,

40:45.904 --> 40:47.113
and put it in the chat.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.740
-Don't forget to take Eli off.
-Yeah.

40:48.782 --> 40:49.908
PJ: We lost a
Justice Warrior today.

40:49.949 --> 40:51.409
SARAH: His choice.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.620
AMBROSE: Casey?

40:53.661 --> 40:55.497
-I'll see you guys later.
-Okay.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.460
Yes, Professor?

41:00.502 --> 41:03.046
-For you.

41:03.088 --> 41:05.340
-What is it?
-I don't know.

41:05.382 --> 41:07.008
-Who's it from?

41:07.050 --> 41:09.219
-Let's just say it's from
someone who believes

41:09.260 --> 41:12.222
that you might be
onto something.

41:12.263 --> 41:13.598
LIAM: Where'd you get this?

41:13.640 --> 41:16.184
-I can't tell you.
But it's from a reliable source.

41:16.226 --> 41:17.644
-I mean, personally,
if I was conducting

41:17.686 --> 41:19.312
an unsanctioned search
for evidentiary proof

41:19.354 --> 41:21.106
to reopen a wrongful
conviction case--

41:21.147 --> 41:22.315
-Which is exactly
what we're doing.

41:22.357 --> 41:24.109
-I would do it just like this.

41:24.150 --> 41:26.736
Come on, an envelope full of
secret collected content?

41:26.778 --> 41:29.531
So sexy.

41:29.572 --> 41:34.369
-Or an envelope with a single
copy of a newspaper article.

41:34.411 --> 41:37.539
-"The body of Philadelphia
native, Tammy Monroe, age 22,

41:37.580 --> 41:40.417
"was found two days ago washed
ashore on the Delaware River."

41:40.458 --> 41:42.419
-I don't remember hearing
anything about this.

41:42.460 --> 41:43.670
-It's because it's not current.

41:43.712 --> 41:45.338
It's from three years ago.

41:45.380 --> 41:48.049
-Huh.

41:48.091 --> 41:50.385
-Local developer
and philanthropist Kurt Teller

41:50.427 --> 41:53.555
and his wife Rachel have
announced a $25,000 reward

41:53.596 --> 41:55.598
for any information
leading to the arrest

41:55.640 --> 41:59.352
and conviction of the person
responsible for Tammy's murder.

41:59.394 --> 42:01.896
Wait, Monroe was an intern
at Teller Developers.

42:01.938 --> 42:04.190
And was a recent hire.

42:04.232 --> 42:06.526
Apparently, Kurt and Rachel
were extremely distraught

42:06.568 --> 42:08.194
at her murder.

42:08.236 --> 42:09.738
-Yeah, check this out:
"My contractor business

42:09.779 --> 42:13.033
"is the firm foundation for
my greater development work."

42:13.074 --> 42:14.743
Apparently he's
"staunchly committed

42:14.784 --> 42:16.161
"to refurbishing the city."

42:16.202 --> 42:18.413
SARAH: Wow, quite
the paradigm of altruism.

42:18.455 --> 42:20.957
-Wait a second, zoom in
on that image right there.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.542
That's Elmwood.

42:22.584 --> 42:25.045
That's where Marcus lives,
where Devina's body was found.

42:25.086 --> 42:27.672
"Urban renewal project."

42:27.714 --> 42:29.549
-Okay...

42:29.591 --> 42:32.302
CASEY: Well, this has to be the
developer Devina was seen with.

42:32.344 --> 42:34.262
-So... whoever sent us this

42:34.304 --> 42:38.350
is telling us if Kurt Teller
murdered Tammy Monroe, then...

42:38.391 --> 42:39.684
maybe he killed Devina?

42:39.726 --> 42:41.561
CASEY: And now he's
gotten away with it

42:41.603 --> 42:43.605
not only once, but twice.

42:45.190 --> 42:46.358
There was no real evidence

42:46.399 --> 42:48.151
linking Teller
to Monroe's murder,

42:48.193 --> 42:51.071
so whoever gave this to you
is probably hoping

42:51.112 --> 42:52.280
that we can find that evidence.

42:52.322 --> 42:53.490
-I'll look into it.

42:53.531 --> 42:55.367
PJ, can you get me
the files from the county

42:55.408 --> 42:56.493
and the investigative reports--

42:56.534 --> 42:57.786
-From the detectives
on Tammy's murder?

42:57.827 --> 42:59.245
Yep, you bet.

42:59.287 --> 43:03.249
SARAH & LIAM: And Kurt
and Rachel Teller's testimonies.

43:03.291 --> 43:05.418
CASEY: Uh, okay, well,
it's a long shot,

43:05.460 --> 43:08.338
but it's the only shot
we've got.

43:08.380 --> 43:11.299
ELI: I don't think
it's such a long shot.

43:17.597 --> 43:20.558
Wow, I don't know whether
I should be impressed

43:20.600 --> 43:23.353
or tell you to go out
the way you came in.

43:23.395 --> 43:24.896
-Casey, can I talk to you
for a second?

43:24.938 --> 43:26.606
-No.

43:26.648 --> 43:28.400
Whatever you want to say to me,
you can say to the group.

43:28.441 --> 43:29.776
-It's not what you think it is.

43:29.818 --> 43:31.695
-Only guilty people
say things like that.

43:31.736 --> 43:34.531
-Devina had been off for months.

43:34.572 --> 43:36.491
-She was clearly having a
relationship with someone else!

43:36.533 --> 43:38.284
-You had to have known.
-I didn't know.

43:38.326 --> 43:39.953
I just...

43:39.994 --> 43:41.204
I had a feeling.

43:41.246 --> 43:43.540
-You're one of
the smartest in our class.

43:43.581 --> 43:45.667
I have a hard time believing
you're that dumb in love.

43:45.709 --> 43:47.293
-Did you ever even
ask her about it?

43:47.335 --> 43:49.379
-No, I...

43:49.421 --> 43:52.424
I didn't want to come off
as insecure or paranoid.

43:52.465 --> 43:54.718
Same reason I didn't say
anything to the cops,

43:54.759 --> 43:56.511
if that's what you're
gonna ask next.

43:56.553 --> 43:58.722
I didn't want to send them
on a wild goose chase.

43:58.763 --> 44:02.559
-When was the last time
you saw her?

44:02.600 --> 44:05.145
-The day before she died.

44:05.186 --> 44:06.312
-Why did you come back?

44:06.354 --> 44:08.898
-To help.

44:08.940 --> 44:10.400
And to apologize.

44:10.442 --> 44:12.444
-Well, in that case...

44:16.406 --> 44:18.575
I'm sorry.

44:18.616 --> 44:20.910
I should've told you the truth
when you asked.

44:20.952 --> 44:22.120
PJ: Hmm.

44:23.288 --> 44:24.914
I mean, I...

44:24.956 --> 44:28.960
I should've told you the truth
before you asked.

44:30.587 --> 44:32.297
One more question...

44:32.339 --> 44:34.257
for now.

44:34.299 --> 44:36.259
How do you know Kurt Teller

44:36.301 --> 44:37.761
if you didn't know
Devina was seeing him?

44:37.802 --> 44:39.929
-Because my dad's done
business with him.

44:39.971 --> 44:43.350
And let me tell you guys,
he is not a nice guy.

44:43.391 --> 44:45.727
He's got friends
in all the right places,

44:45.769 --> 44:46.978
so we need to be careful.

44:47.020 --> 44:48.605
-We?
-Yeah, we.

44:48.646 --> 44:51.775
If Kurt did this, I need to
be part of taking him down.

44:51.816 --> 44:54.444
-And getting Marcus
an exoneration, right?

44:54.486 --> 44:56.780
-Yes, of course--
Casey, of course.

44:56.821 --> 44:58.573
-[sighs]

45:01.576 --> 45:04.621
Okay, look...

45:04.662 --> 45:07.791
Like it or not, he knows
how to work evidence.

45:07.832 --> 45:09.959
There's no one in our
entire law school class

45:10.001 --> 45:11.419
that knows their way around
criminal procedure

45:11.461 --> 45:12.504
the way that Eli does.

45:12.545 --> 45:14.798
ELI: It's true.

45:14.839 --> 45:17.384
-Not helping.

45:17.425 --> 45:19.678
Besides, Liam, he's paying you.

45:19.719 --> 45:22.681
So, are we all okay with this?

45:22.722 --> 45:24.307
-If you're okay, I'm okay.

45:24.349 --> 45:26.309
-I mean, I don't trust him.

45:26.351 --> 45:29.104
But, uh, then again, I don't
trust anybody, so, yeah, sure.

45:29.145 --> 45:31.481
CASEY: Sarah?

45:31.523 --> 45:33.650
-Whatever.
You know what?

45:33.692 --> 45:35.235
I've gotta get back to the lab,

45:35.276 --> 45:36.820
make some headway
on my actual work.

45:36.861 --> 45:39.155
LIAM: You do you, boo.
Text ya later.

45:39.197 --> 45:41.157
-Yeah, on the group chat.

45:41.199 --> 45:42.701
About the case.

45:42.742 --> 45:45.662
-Yeah, right on, that's...
that's what I said, I think.

45:46.788 --> 45:48.498
Uh, PJ,
can you get on those docs?

45:48.540 --> 45:50.667
-Yeah, will do.
-Yeah.

45:50.709 --> 45:53.169
Alright, so...
what happens now?

45:53.211 --> 45:55.964
-Now the real fun begins.

45:56.006 --> 46:00.802
[dramatic music]

46:00.844 --> 46:02.721
CASEY: Is this the man
you saw with our friend

46:02.762 --> 46:04.639
who was murdered?
-That's the guy.

46:04.681 --> 46:07.100
-And when did you start
seeing him hanging around here?

46:07.142 --> 46:11.688
-Uh, spring, when they broke
ground on that new building.

46:11.730 --> 46:14.482
-If you, uh, think of anything
else or you notice anything

46:14.524 --> 46:16.693
weird or concerning, call me.

46:16.735 --> 46:17.944
-Why are you asking now?

46:17.986 --> 46:19.446
Didn't they catch the guy
that killed her?

46:19.487 --> 46:21.448
-They didn't catch
the right guy.

46:21.489 --> 46:22.991
Thank you, Salim.
You've been really helpful.

right there.

46:33.835 --> 46:36.087
I'm gonna come back later
to set up some security cams

46:36.129 --> 46:37.255

LIAM: Hey.

46:39.924 --> 46:41.509
-Finally caught up at the lab
and at your disposal.

46:41.551 --> 46:42.594
Did we get anything?

46:42.635 --> 46:43.845
-I think we found
Kurt's hideout.

46:43.887 --> 46:45.513
LIAM: Yeah, we pulled
this up earlier.

46:45.555 --> 46:47.474

erecting buildings,

46:47.515 --> 46:48.850

social schedule...

He's either a saint
or a psychopath.

46:50.769 --> 46:52.437
CASEY: So, what do we do now?
Surveil him?

46:52.479 --> 46:54.606
-Yeah. I'll tell Kurt.
Sarahbella?

46:54.647 --> 46:56.232
-I don't think
I agreed to a nickname.

46:56.274 --> 46:57.609
-It'll grow on you.

46:57.650 --> 46:59.402
I'm gonna need you to
run prints off of anything

46:59.444 --> 47:00.904
I can snag off of Kurt Teller,

47:00.945 --> 47:03.406
and then test for a potential
match to that latent set.

47:03.448 --> 47:04.783
-Copy.

47:04.824 --> 47:06.785
CASEY: If this guy Kurt is
who we think he is,

47:06.826 --> 47:08.370
I feel bad for his wife.

47:08.411 --> 47:09.871
ELI: You're assuming
she doesn't know.

47:09.913 --> 47:11.873
Most of these women know their
husbands are who they are,

47:11.915 --> 47:14.125
but they protect the facade
for the sake of their lifestyle.

47:14.167 --> 47:15.460
-Yeah, you wanna
learn about the husband,

47:15.502 --> 47:16.961
follow the wife.

47:17.003 --> 47:18.630
Especially when she's
the type that'll lie for him.

47:18.672 --> 47:19.881
-Yeah, if she's
protected him before,

47:19.923 --> 47:21.716
who's to say
she's not doing it now?

47:21.758 --> 47:23.468
-I'm gonna need one of you
to befriend her.

47:23.510 --> 47:24.594
-I can do it.

47:24.636 --> 47:25.929
-Should I work recon with you?

47:25.970 --> 47:29.140
-No, no way. Uh, you can...
work with Casey.

47:29.182 --> 47:30.642
-Buckle up, warriors.

47:30.684 --> 47:32.310
CASEY: PJ, that was
even fast for you!

47:32.352 --> 47:34.646
-Yeah, what can I say?
I might be an actual magician.

47:34.688 --> 47:36.231
CASEY: I think you are.

47:36.272 --> 47:38.066
-I got the testimonies
and police reports

47:38.108 --> 47:40.985
on Tammy's murder,
for your reading pleasure.

47:41.027 --> 47:42.153
Or not.

47:42.195 --> 47:44.823
It's pretty dire,
so allow me to summarize.

47:44.864 --> 47:47.158
Not bound,
no prints found on her body,

47:47.200 --> 47:49.828
but she did show
signs of strangulation.

47:49.869 --> 47:52.789
-That's only a one-out-of-three
match to Devina, then.

47:52.831 --> 47:54.416
-Investigative reports
on Tammy's apartment

47:54.457 --> 47:56.543
found a cellphone with 17 calls

47:56.584 --> 47:58.795
to the same number
on the night she died.

47:58.837 --> 48:01.131
And guess whose name
popped up on the testimonies?

48:01.172 --> 48:02.799
-Uh, Kurt Teller.

48:06.177 --> 48:08.471
"Tammy had a tumultuous
relationship with a boyfriend

48:08.513 --> 48:09.931
"who was in and out of her life.

48:09.973 --> 48:11.474
"A really troubled guy.

48:11.516 --> 48:13.977
"She called me obsessively
because she was under duress

48:14.019 --> 48:16.855
"and because
we were having an affair."

48:16.896 --> 48:18.273
He admitted to the affair?

48:18.314 --> 48:20.150
How did this never
come out in the press?

48:20.191 --> 48:22.152
ELI: Telling you.
Friends in high places.

48:22.193 --> 48:24.779
LIAM: Huh, so he admitted
to an affair to save his butt.

48:24.821 --> 48:27.407
Uh, I found a phone number
that links to an old cellphone

48:27.449 --> 48:28.825
belonging to Kurt Teller.

48:28.867 --> 48:31.995
Which means
he had multiple phones.

48:32.037 --> 48:33.413
Alright,
I sent you the coordinates

48:33.455 --> 48:36.458
for Kurt Teller's house.
Covertly stake out the premises.

48:36.499 --> 48:37.834
If Kurt pops up, text me.

48:37.876 --> 48:39.336
If you see Rachel, follow her.

48:39.377 --> 48:45.425
*

48:45.467 --> 48:46.843
What are you looking at?

48:46.885 --> 48:49.596
-Devina's post online.

48:49.637 --> 48:51.181
The last thing
she posted was six hours

48:51.222 --> 48:52.390
before she was murdered.

48:52.432 --> 48:54.392
Just trying to get an idea
of her movements.

48:56.770 --> 49:00.815
I'm sorry.
This must be so hard for you.

49:00.857 --> 49:03.193
-The sad part is...

49:03.234 --> 49:04.861
I'm not shocked
that Devina had an affair

49:04.903 --> 49:06.196
with someone like Kurt.

49:06.237 --> 49:08.156
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

49:08.198 --> 49:10.492
No, I often wondered if
the only reason she liked me

49:10.533 --> 49:12.452
was because of
my family's money.

49:12.494 --> 49:14.120
-And you didn't
break up with her?

49:14.162 --> 49:16.915
-Nah, you just get
used to it after a while,

49:16.956 --> 49:18.541
and assume that everyone
wants to be your friend

49:18.583 --> 49:20.377
because of your family's status.

49:20.418 --> 49:22.045
-Wow...

49:22.087 --> 49:23.963
That is, um...

49:24.005 --> 49:25.882
That's one problem I have
never had to deal with.

49:25.924 --> 49:27.258
-[chuckles]
Yeah.

49:30.929 --> 49:32.722
So, how did you and Devina
become friends?

49:32.764 --> 49:36.393
You're so different.

49:36.434 --> 49:40.021
Oh, I-- no, no,
I don't mean that in a bad way.

49:40.063 --> 49:41.064
-Okay...

49:41.106 --> 49:42.691
-I don't mean that
in any way.

49:42.732 --> 49:44.484
I was just...

49:44.526 --> 49:45.735
-It's okay, you're...

49:45.777 --> 49:47.654
you're actually right.

49:47.696 --> 49:48.988
-Okay.
-We were.

49:49.030 --> 49:51.366
We were... we were
very, very different.

49:51.408 --> 49:53.952
Um...

49:53.993 --> 49:56.246
I dunno, we met at
freshman orientation.

49:56.287 --> 49:59.332
I'd just lost my mom,
she lost her mom the same year,

49:59.374 --> 50:02.961
and we were sort of
trauma-bonded for life.

50:03.003 --> 50:05.255
Yeah, I mean, it's why Marcus
and I are so close.

50:05.296 --> 50:08.299
I practically raised him.

50:08.341 --> 50:11.594
We're the only two people
we have left in the world.

50:11.636 --> 50:13.596
-So, how did you become...

50:13.638 --> 50:15.932
you?

50:15.974 --> 50:17.267
And your brother is...

50:17.308 --> 50:19.894
-In prison?
-Yeah.

50:19.936 --> 50:22.272
-Yeah, you can say it,
it's okay.

50:22.313 --> 50:24.607
-That's what I meant.

50:24.649 --> 50:26.151
-Um...

50:28.570 --> 50:31.364
Trauma is a bit of a wildcard.

50:31.406 --> 50:34.075
You know, either you fight,
you fly, or you freeze.

50:34.117 --> 50:36.786
And I had no choice;
I had to fight.

50:36.828 --> 50:39.956
I'm the oldest; I had
my brother to take care of.

50:39.998 --> 50:43.293
But Marcus, he just...

50:43.335 --> 50:45.378
flew.

50:45.420 --> 50:48.673
He's been running from
that pain ever since.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.800
-That's some hard stuff.

50:50.842 --> 50:52.510
-It's also my life.

Yeah, let's follow her, yup.

Do you just have, like,
a treasure chest of costumes

51:29.756 --> 51:30.924
lying around?

51:30.965 --> 51:32.425
-Uh, yeah.
Why, you don't?

the case is gonna take me.

51:42.310 --> 51:44.270
-Is that why
you wanted to be a PI?

51:44.312 --> 51:46.690
-I actually wanted
to join the CIA, but...

51:46.731 --> 51:47.816
-Why didn't you?

51:47.857 --> 51:49.901
-Oh, I still have plans to.

51:49.943 --> 51:52.862
It's just,
this is what pays the bills.

51:52.904 --> 51:54.531
-So, what do people
usually hire you for?

51:54.572 --> 51:56.199
-Insurance claims.

51:56.241 --> 51:58.618
Uh, spouses hiring me to catch
their unfaithful partners.

51:58.660 --> 52:01.830
Every once in a while, I get
something juicy like this.

52:01.871 --> 52:04.749
But I got plans to go
international, baby.

52:04.791 --> 52:06.501
-I can see it.

52:08.086 --> 52:12.716
Uh, and then what?

52:12.757 --> 52:15.260
-Buy a house
for my mom and pops.

52:17.595 --> 52:20.181
Um, what about you?

52:20.223 --> 52:22.726
What made you want to
investigate evidence

52:22.767 --> 52:24.436
from gruesome crime scenes?

52:24.477 --> 52:25.770
-[chuckles]

52:25.812 --> 52:28.815
Norman Bates was my Magnum PI.

52:28.857 --> 52:31.609
-What?
-No, I just...

52:31.651 --> 52:32.819
I've always loved the macabre.

52:32.861 --> 52:34.237
-Okay.
-Yeah.

52:34.279 --> 52:35.655
That is weird.

about that career choice?

stop doing recon on me!

54:34.566 --> 54:36.985
-In the discovery,
you said the rope

54:37.027 --> 54:38.611
used to bind Devina's hands
was what...

54:38.653 --> 54:40.363
-Boat rope.

54:40.405 --> 54:43.700

54:48.913 --> 54:50.540

on this party yacht.

54:52.917 --> 54:54.627
-Which means accessible
boat rope is not something

54:54.669 --> 54:55.879
he's lacking.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.797
-No.
-I need to get close to Rachel.

54:57.839 --> 54:59.257
LIAM: On it.
Stand by.

55:01.134 --> 55:03.845
ELI: Did you just hack
into Rachel's calendar?

55:03.887 --> 55:06.348
LIAM: Oh, yeah.
I'm booking you in for 10 am.

55:06.389 --> 55:09.267
You guys are gonna need to
find a space, a backstory.

55:09.309 --> 55:11.102
-I am notwearing a costume.

55:11.144 --> 55:13.229
-Uh, you will do whatever I say.

55:13.271 --> 55:16.066
Whatever makes you guys
believable as a young couple

55:16.107 --> 55:17.901
with enough cash
to hire Lady Teller.

55:17.942 --> 55:20.111
-Hey, Sarah, can we get
access to the vacant loft

55:20.153 --> 55:22.238
in your dad's building tomorrow?

55:22.280 --> 55:23.615
Great, okay.

55:23.656 --> 55:25.492
And also, I'm gonna need
your help picking out, like,

55:25.533 --> 55:27.452
a dress or something fancy.

55:27.494 --> 55:28.787
I know, you're so excited.

55:28.828 --> 55:30.372
Okay, calm--
Sarah, calm down.

55:30.413 --> 55:32.749
Okay, bye, bye!

55:32.791 --> 55:34.292
Okay, we're in.

55:34.334 --> 55:36.836
I also have to get some
semblance of studying done.

55:36.878 --> 55:38.797
I'm gonna go,
but do you need anything?

55:38.838 --> 55:40.590
Are you good?
-Yeah, good as gravy, baby.

55:40.632 --> 55:43.009
I will be on stakeout
until Kurt and Rachel dock.

55:43.051 --> 55:44.678
-Amazing.
I'll see you at 10 am.

55:44.719 --> 55:46.846
Great work this week.

55:46.888 --> 55:48.598
And good work to you too.

56:11.579 --> 56:12.914

56:12.956 --> 56:14.791
Uh, you too.

56:14.833 --> 56:17.419
Uh, handsome, not beautiful.

56:17.460 --> 56:18.586
The-- yeah.

56:18.628 --> 56:20.880
[clears throat]
Right.

56:20.922 --> 56:22.799
Wow, she really
does not look happy

56:22.841 --> 56:25.010
about the scheduling mistake.

56:28.013 --> 56:30.265
There must have
been a calendar mix-up.

56:30.306 --> 56:32.475
Mrs. Teller will see you now.

56:35.645 --> 56:37.313
RACHEL: My apologies.

56:37.355 --> 56:39.149
I thought someone else
was booked at this time.

56:39.190 --> 56:40.567
I'm Rachel Teller.

56:40.608 --> 56:41.568
And you are...?

56:41.609 --> 56:43.028
-Michael Madison.

56:43.069 --> 56:44.654
And this is my wife, Mia.

56:44.696 --> 56:46.031
-How do you do?
-Oh, how cute!

56:46.072 --> 56:47.991
M & M!
[chuckles]

56:48.033 --> 56:49.659
Let me guess,
you had personalized M&M's

56:49.701 --> 56:50.660
at your wedding?

56:50.702 --> 56:53.204
-You guessed it!

56:53.246 --> 56:55.165
RACHEL: Please, have a seat.

56:55.206 --> 56:57.000
So, how can I help you?

56:57.042 --> 57:00.003
-Well, my wife and I
recently got married.

57:00.045 --> 57:01.171
RACHEL: Congratulations.

57:01.212 --> 57:02.922
-Thank you.
-Thank you, thank you.

57:02.964 --> 57:06.801
And we purchased
a spacious loft in Society Hill.

57:06.843 --> 57:09.471
-Oh!
I love that area.

57:09.512 --> 57:11.931
I've always wanted to get
my hands on one of those lofts.

57:11.973 --> 57:14.184
-We were hoping
you'd say that.

57:14.225 --> 57:16.353
-See, I just don't know
what to do with the space!

57:16.394 --> 57:18.146
Design isn't necessarily
my forte.

57:18.188 --> 57:20.440
RACHEL: Oh, well, you certainly
know how to dress.

57:20.482 --> 57:22.859
-Well, actually,
he bought this for me

57:22.901 --> 57:24.861
on our honeymoon in Paris.

57:24.903 --> 57:26.363
He knows how to spoil me rotten.

57:26.404 --> 57:28.990
-[giggles] Okay, so tell me
a little about yourselves!

57:29.032 --> 57:31.201
It helps me to know what kind of
aesthetic you're looking for.

57:31.242 --> 57:33.828
-Well, we met in...

57:33.870 --> 57:35.080
-College.

57:35.121 --> 57:36.831
-College, yes,
in our freshman year.

57:36.873 --> 57:39.250
-You're adorable!

57:39.292 --> 57:41.586
-We really just want
our place to remind us

57:41.628 --> 57:43.296
of our time in Paris.

57:43.338 --> 57:46.633
-Mia is a big fan of
the drama of Jacques Garcia.

57:46.675 --> 57:48.218
-I am? I am.

57:48.259 --> 57:52.389
-I, myself, prefer the design
elements of Jean-Louis Deniot.

57:52.430 --> 57:53.723
RACHEL: No...

57:53.765 --> 57:54.933
-Oui, oui!

57:54.974 --> 57:58.395
RACHEL: Oh, I love Deniot!

57:58.436 --> 58:01.439
Okay, look, normally,
I am booked out far in advance,

58:01.481 --> 58:03.358
but I could clear some things

58:03.400 --> 58:05.235
and slot you in
by the end of the month.

58:05.276 --> 58:07.404
Sound good?
[phone buzzing]

58:07.445 --> 58:11.241
-Oh, that is so
incredibly kind of you.

58:11.282 --> 58:13.284
Unfortunately,
we need someone who can

58:13.326 --> 58:15.120
get started as soon as possible.

58:15.161 --> 58:17.247
You see, our marketing firm,
it's a startup,

58:17.288 --> 58:20.458
and we have a piece
in New Day Décor;

58:20.500 --> 58:23.336
they need to shoot by the end
of the month in the space,

58:23.378 --> 58:25.839
featuring the designer heavily.
It's a whole thing.

58:25.880 --> 58:27.924
-So, is there another designer
that you can recommend?

58:27.966 --> 58:29.384
Someone of your calibre,
of course.

58:29.426 --> 58:31.594
-Of course.
-Hmm...

58:31.636 --> 58:36.766
Okay, let me just have another
look at my calendar here.

58:36.808 --> 58:38.518
Oh, that's weird.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.270
I was supposed to see
Mrs. Purcell this afternoon

58:40.311 --> 58:41.688
for her big installation.

58:41.730 --> 58:43.857
-You know, I hear there's
a bug going around.

58:43.898 --> 58:46.443
-I heard that too.
-It's so nasty.

58:46.484 --> 58:48.069
-Well, how's today at 2 pm?

58:48.111 --> 58:50.780
-That would be just perfect.
-BOTH: Mm-hm.

58:50.822 --> 58:52.824
RACHEL: Excellent.

-And that's the last.
-Thanks, I'll get right on it.

This is gorgeous! Oh...

01:00:01.476 --> 01:00:05.063
Like Deniot, I will dress these
windows ceiling to floor.

01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:07.607
Oh, the exposed brick
is stunning.

01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:10.652
We will not be touching that.
Have you picked a colour scheme?

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:13.488
I love Deniot's ability to
mix patterns and textures,

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.782
capturing both the masculine
and feminine.

01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:18.076
-Well, I'm a big fan
of bold pops of colour.

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:20.036
-I'm more of a neutral
kind of guy,

01:00:20.078 --> 01:00:21.955
but I think we can
find a compromise

01:00:21.996 --> 01:00:23.498
we both find favourable.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.000
I just want
my bride to be happy.

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.418
-Aw!

01:00:26.459 --> 01:00:28.420
See, he's still sweeping
me off my feet,

01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:29.879
even without the acapella.

01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:33.091
-That's so sweet.
Now, let's discuss bedrooms.

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:35.969
I'm assuming primary,
guest, and...

01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:38.263
nursery?

01:00:38.304 --> 01:00:40.223
-I think we want to
grow our business

01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:41.891
for a couple of years,
and then...

01:00:41.933 --> 01:00:43.601
I'm sure kids are in our future.

01:00:43.643 --> 01:00:45.145
Do you have kids?

01:00:45.186 --> 01:00:46.521
-No.

01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:49.190
Um, my husband and I
tried for years,

01:00:49.232 --> 01:00:52.402
but after enough
unsuccessful rounds of IVF,

01:00:52.444 --> 01:00:55.155
we decided that a family
was not in our plans.

01:00:55.196 --> 01:00:56.865
We bought a boat instead.

01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:57.907
-[laughter]
-Oh, nice.

01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.951
We built two
successful businesses.

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:01.703
We can travel whenever we want.

01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:03.997
Things have a way
of working out.

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:05.665
Also, kids cost a lot.

01:01:05.707 --> 01:01:07.459
So, enjoy that purse
while you can!

Oh, I need to take this,

01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:13.506
but I've seen enough
to get started.

01:01:13.548 --> 01:01:15.008
So I'm gonna
leave this with you.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.260
I will get you a mood board
by end of day tomorrow

01:01:17.302 --> 01:01:20.305

by end of month.

-Well, forensics
are suggesting suicide,

confirm until autopsy.

maybe my intel's off.

I will let you know.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:12.435
to the latent set
on Devina's watch.

01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:14.437
Our techs managed to lift
prints from Kurt's neck

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:16.189
and several
from around the trailer.

01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.941
I'm gonna stay and run them.

01:04:17.982 --> 01:04:19.609
I gotta go.

01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:21.361
[call hangs up]

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.862
ELI: Case, don't even go there.

01:04:22.904 --> 01:04:25.281
Those prints could belong
to whoever killed Kurt.

01:04:25.323 --> 01:04:28.493
We find that person,
we find Devina's killer.

01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:30.829
-Look, I'm gonna go out,
start canvassing the area,

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.330
see if there's
anything I missed.

01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:34.791
You know, Sarah's doing her
due diligence on the prints,

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:37.460
and maybe you guys comb through
the discovery one more time?

01:04:37.502 --> 01:04:38.503
-Yeah.

01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:39.462
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:04:39.504 --> 01:04:42.632
-Just keep your head up, okay?

01:04:42.674 --> 01:04:44.676
I always find my guy.

01:04:46.845 --> 01:04:48.680
ELI: First year in
the public defender's office,

01:04:48.722 --> 01:04:50.056
this is all I did.

01:04:50.098 --> 01:04:53.059
Hot tip for ya--
scan in spurts to stay sharp.

01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:54.853
[phone buzzing]

01:04:57.647 --> 01:04:58.982
Hey, Sarah.

01:04:59.024 --> 01:05:00.942
-The prints found on Kurt's neck
from the crime scene

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:03.194
are a perfect match to the
latent set on Devina's watch.

01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:05.238
But hold on,
because we have still no record

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.240
of who those
matching prints belong to.

01:05:07.282 --> 01:05:10.035
-Great, so that means the person
is A) not in the system

01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:11.411
and B)...

01:05:11.453 --> 01:05:13.371
-They could be
anywhere or anyone.

01:05:25.842 --> 01:05:27.635
ELI: What is it?

01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:28.928
What are you seeing?

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:34.726
See if you can find
the evidence list,

01:05:34.768 --> 01:05:36.478
if your
upperclassman ring's on it.

01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:37.729
-What?

01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:39.356
-Well, it's not pictured
here in the evidence,

01:05:39.397 --> 01:05:42.609
but she had it six hours
before she was murdered.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.864
Eli?

01:05:47.906 --> 01:05:49.657
What's going on?
You good?

01:05:49.699 --> 01:05:51.868
-Yeah, um...

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.119
It's...

01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:54.954
[exhales]

01:05:54.996 --> 01:05:58.249
It's not there,
because I have it.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:02.045
SARAH: [on phone]
Are you kidding me?

01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:03.296
-Sarah, I'm gonna call you back.

01:06:03.338 --> 01:06:05.006
- No, no, I want to--
-[call beeps off]

01:06:07.425 --> 01:06:08.635
ELI: Can we just...

01:06:08.677 --> 01:06:10.178
-You said you didn't
see her that day.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.554
-I know I did, I know.
Please, listen.

01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:13.056
-Six hours before
she was murdered,

01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:13.932
she was wearing that ring.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.437
The reason it wasn't
pictured with the body

01:06:19.479 --> 01:06:22.732
and found with the body
is because you saw her

01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:26.653
sometime in those six hours,
and you-- you took the ring.

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:28.154
-Can I just please
explain myself?

01:06:28.196 --> 01:06:30.115
-You lied to us, Eli.
You lied to us again.

01:06:30.156 --> 01:06:31.741
-No, but I am
telling the truth now.

01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:34.119
Why didn't you want anyone
to know you saw her that day?

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.579
-I went to her house
to confront her

01:06:36.621 --> 01:06:39.249
and then we got
into this big fight.

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:42.127
-About what?

01:06:42.168 --> 01:06:43.628
Eli, answer the question.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.006
-She admitted she was
in love with someone else!

01:06:46.047 --> 01:06:47.465
Okay?

01:06:47.507 --> 01:06:50.093
But she wouldn't say who,
but said that everyone

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:52.595
would know soon and they were
gonna run away together

01:06:52.637 --> 01:06:55.598
and there was nothing
I could do to stop her.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.102
So I demanded that she give me
my ring back, and I left.

01:06:59.144 --> 01:07:00.854
That was it.

01:07:00.895 --> 01:07:03.023
-You tell me.

01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:04.816
You tell me right now that
you didn't know it was Kurt

01:07:04.858 --> 01:07:05.984
this whole time.

01:07:06.026 --> 01:07:08.028
-No, I swear.

01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:09.612
-I don't believe you.
-Oh, Casey.

01:07:09.654 --> 01:07:12.282
-I don't!
Did Frank know?

01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:13.742
-I don't know!

01:07:13.783 --> 01:07:15.452
Casey, I-I'm telling
you everything...

01:07:15.493 --> 01:07:16.953
-No.
-...right now.

01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:19.622
Look, look, I didn't--
I didn't say anything before

01:07:19.664 --> 01:07:22.250
because I knew that it
would make me a suspect,

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:25.170
but I also knew
that I didn't kill her!

01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:26.838
-How do I know that?
-Are you serious?

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.923
-You just saw her
the night she was murdered!

01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:31.426
Okay, you knew-- you knew
she was having an affair,

01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:33.970
so you have a motive,
and you have been lying to us

01:07:34.012 --> 01:07:35.347
this entire time!

01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:37.140
-No, look,
if I am guilty of anything,

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:39.476
it's of protecting myself.

01:07:39.517 --> 01:07:42.312
-I cannot believe that
I gave you a second chance.

01:07:42.354 --> 01:07:43.897
-Oh, Casey, come on.
Please, please...

01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:46.483
-You need to leave, Eli.
-Casey, please.

01:07:46.524 --> 01:07:48.818
-Eli, get out now!
-Casey...

-I am so sorry.

I promise you, I promise
I'm doing everything I can

to get you out of here.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.398

Hey, hey, hey.

Listen, since we were kids,
you've never let me down.

Anything you put your
mind to, you've done.

01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:44.708
I know you can do this.

01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:47.961
And...

01:08:48.003 --> 01:08:50.130
I can hold on until you do.

01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:53.258
Deal?

Look, I know we're not
in the best of places,

01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:09.274
but I could really
use someone to talk to.

01:09:09.315 --> 01:09:10.942
-Okay.

01:09:10.984 --> 01:09:14.237
-I know you and Eli became close
while he was dating Devina,

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:17.407
but I really think
you should know this.

01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:20.035
Eli had told me
that he hadn't seen Devina

01:09:20.076 --> 01:09:22.078
the day that she, um...

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.122
[phone buzzing]

01:09:24.164 --> 01:09:25.373
Uh, really sorry about this.

01:09:25.415 --> 01:09:27.042
Um...

01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:29.502
Anyway, uh, Eli lied.

01:09:29.544 --> 01:09:33.381
It turns out he had
seen Devina that day.

01:09:33.423 --> 01:09:35.050
And I know I've asked
you this before, Frank.

01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:36.384
I know, and I just...

01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:38.428
I really need you to
just try and remember

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:40.388
and be honest with me.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.391
Did she ever say
anything about...

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:44.934
someone else?

01:09:44.976 --> 01:09:47.771
Or, or breaking up with Eli,
or running away with them,

01:09:47.812 --> 01:09:48.813
or...?

I really gotta take this.

01:09:58.323 --> 01:10:00.367
I'll be fast.

Liam, what do you need?

01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:03.661
LIAM: [phone] I checked
the footage on my cameras

01:10:03.703 --> 01:10:05.246
at Kurt's place.
You will never believe

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:08.416
who I pegged outside
just before Kurt's murder.

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:09.959
Wait, hold on,
I'm gonna send you a video.

01:10:10.001 --> 01:10:12.087

belong to Frank!

-Oh my God,
Frank killed Kurt.

[dramatic music]

01:10:32.107 --> 01:10:35.110
So you figured it out?

01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:37.153
-Frank...

01:10:37.195 --> 01:10:39.364
-One day, you'll be a parent,
and you'll know

01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:41.199
what it feels like
to love someone so much

01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:42.325
that if someone hurts them,

01:10:42.367 --> 01:10:44.202
you do anything
to make them pay.

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:47.539
-I'm sure I would have done
the exact same thing.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.874
Frank, how did you know
it was Kurt?

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:52.252
-I didn't.

01:10:52.293 --> 01:10:53.628
Until recently.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.716
If I did, I...

01:10:57.757 --> 01:10:59.384
I could've saved her.

01:10:59.426 --> 01:11:01.845
Before Devina was killed,

01:11:01.886 --> 01:11:03.680
she was acting like
a different person.

01:11:03.722 --> 01:11:05.890
I thought I was
losing my daughter.

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:09.436
And so I confronted her,
and that's when she told me

01:11:09.477 --> 01:11:12.731
that she was in love,
but she wouldn't say who.

01:11:12.772 --> 01:11:15.191
Whoever he was,
I knew he was to blame,

01:11:15.233 --> 01:11:17.736
so I tried to convince her
to stop seeing him,

01:11:17.777 --> 01:11:21.031
to focus on herself, but she was
leaving to go be with him!

01:11:21.072 --> 01:11:23.408
So I grabbed her wrist.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:25.952
This was the last time
I saw her alive.

01:11:25.994 --> 01:11:29.205
-Frank, you did everything
you could to try and save her.

01:11:29.247 --> 01:11:33.460
-I wish that was true.

01:11:33.501 --> 01:11:35.211
Even after she was murdered,

01:11:35.253 --> 01:11:38.381
I was convinced
it was your brother too.

01:11:38.423 --> 01:11:40.175
But then I saw you in the cafe.

01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:41.676
I couldn't shake what you said.

01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:44.346
So I snooped through her stuff,

01:11:44.387 --> 01:11:47.432
and that's when
I found out about Kurt.

01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:50.477
There was a picture of the two
of them on her bedside table,

01:11:50.518 --> 01:11:53.813
and a few notes
that she kept from him.

01:11:53.855 --> 01:11:55.815
So I followed him.

01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:03.823
And when I saw that
he got into that trailer,

01:12:03.865 --> 01:12:09.496
I realized how close he was
to where she was killed.

01:12:09.537 --> 01:12:12.499
I paid him a visit.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:15.001
-You confronted Kurt?

01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:16.294
-Yeah, I didn't
want to hurt him.

01:12:16.336 --> 01:12:17.879
I only wanted to know the truth.

01:12:17.921 --> 01:12:20.298
But when I asked him
if he killed my daughter,

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:23.134
with that smug look
on his face, he said,

01:12:23.176 --> 01:12:24.636
"Your daughter was delusional!

01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:26.971
"She was threatening
to blow up our lives!"

01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:30.392
And I was recording it
on my phone, and he saw it,

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:32.060
and he attacked me.

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:35.939
And before I knew it, I had
my hands around his throat.

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.858
I wanted to see his life
squeezed out of him.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.403
Just like he had done
to my daughter.

01:12:41.444 --> 01:12:45.949
He used her and he threw
her away like trash.

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:49.411
Like she was nothing.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:51.663
And she was my everything.

01:12:51.705 --> 01:12:54.708
[crying]

01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:58.878

gonna see her again.

Frank, I'm sorry.

is something I'm ever gonna be.

if it helps,

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.540
with Kurt's confession,

01:13:35.582 --> 01:13:38.877
Frank will probably
get off on self-defence.

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:41.379
-That actually does help.

01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:44.591
Thank you.

01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:45.925
How did you find me?

It's Rachel's assistant.

01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:55.769
They're probably calling
to cancel the appointment

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:56.728
this afternoon.

01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:59.647
This is Mia.

01:13:59.689 --> 01:14:03.151
You're calling to confirm
the appointment this afternoon?

01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:05.070
-[in a whisper] Keep it.
-Why?

01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:06.905
-Just say you'll be there.

01:14:06.946 --> 01:14:09.074

01:14:09.115 --> 01:14:11.534
Thank you.

01:14:11.576 --> 01:14:12.911
What is going on?

01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:14.579
Why-- why would I keep
this appointment?

01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:17.082
Why would she keep it?
Her husband just died.

01:14:17.123 --> 01:14:18.750
-Yeah.

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:20.168
Exactly.

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.586
Um...

01:14:21.628 --> 01:14:23.630
Tell everyone to meet
at the loft, like now.

01:14:23.672 --> 01:14:25.590
-Uh, not Eli.
He's out.

01:14:25.632 --> 01:14:27.509
-Well, he's gotta be back in.

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.094
I'm sorry,
I'll explain everything to you

01:14:29.135 --> 01:14:32.764
when we get there.

01:14:32.806 --> 01:14:34.974
LIAM: I knew there was
something kooky about Rachel,

01:14:35.016 --> 01:14:37.060
so I went through the data
on Kurt's phones.

01:14:37.102 --> 01:14:39.354
I didn't get a chance
to tell any of you guyses,

01:14:39.396 --> 01:14:41.106
because, you know,
I was saving Casey's life.

01:14:41.147 --> 01:14:43.108
-You didn't save my life.

01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:45.402
-I... you know.

01:14:45.443 --> 01:14:46.945
I was ready to.
-Yeah...

01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:50.782
-Anywho, Kurt only contacted
other women on his second phone,

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:53.910
but his calls and his texts from
Rachel were on his first phone.

01:14:53.952 --> 01:14:56.621
But the night
that Devina was murdered,

01:14:56.663 --> 01:15:00.208
Devina got texts from Kurt's
actual phone, his first phone,

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.835
asking her to come
to his trailer.

01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:05.755
Why would Kurt contact Devina
on his actual phone

01:15:05.797 --> 01:15:09.134
that he never used for other
women on that specific night?

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:10.802
-Because it wasn't him.

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:11.845
It was Rachel.

01:15:11.886 --> 01:15:13.680
-Ding, ding, ding!
A+, Casey.

01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:16.266
-She had access,
she had motive.

01:15:16.307 --> 01:15:18.476
-Liam, do you happen to have
a copy of Kurt's confession?

01:15:18.518 --> 01:15:20.145
CASEY: Oh, you legend.

01:15:20.186 --> 01:15:22.105
KURT: [audio] Your daughter
was delusional.

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:24.566
She was threatening
to blow up our lives.

01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:26.568
-Kurt never said
he killed Devina.

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.903
-He just alluded that
she got what she deserved.

01:15:28.945 --> 01:15:30.989
-And we were focused
on Kurt the entire time.

01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:32.449
-Mm-hm.

01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:35.326
That's why I always say,
always follow the wife.

01:15:35.368 --> 01:15:38.079
-But there's still no solid
evidence connecting Rachel

01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:39.456
to the murder, guys.

01:15:39.497 --> 01:15:40.832
-And unless we get
an eyewitness testimony

01:15:40.874 --> 01:15:43.335
placing her at the crime,
or a confession,

01:15:43.376 --> 01:15:44.878
Marcus still stays in prison.

01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:46.463
-Yeah, exactly.

01:15:46.504 --> 01:15:48.882
And that's why Michael and Mia
are gonna get her to confess.

01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:51.843
-No.
Just Mia.

01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:55.138
She's never gonna confess
if you're there.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.431
-You're right.

01:15:56.473 --> 01:15:58.183

-Right.

01:21:51.244 --> 01:21:53.788
-But he's happy that justice
got served in the end.

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:56.958
Rachel's all set for trial,
and between the tape of Kurt

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.877
and the evidence we found,

01:21:58.918 --> 01:22:01.046
it's enough to prove
Frank's self-defence.

01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:03.423
-I'm glad to hear that.

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:05.884
-And he offered me a full-time
position at the DA's office

01:22:05.925 --> 01:22:07.177
when I graduate.

01:22:07.218 --> 01:22:10.263
-What? Whoa, Casey!
That's amazing.

01:22:10.305 --> 01:22:11.848
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:14.225
-Thank you.
I turned him down.

01:22:14.267 --> 01:22:15.727
-Wha--

01:22:15.769 --> 01:22:17.645
-I asked to be transferred
to the conviction integrity unit

01:22:17.687 --> 01:22:20.732
next summer
for my last year's internship.

01:22:25.028 --> 01:22:26.529
Um...

01:22:26.571 --> 01:22:27.614
-Yeah?

01:22:27.655 --> 01:22:29.616
-I-I, um...

01:22:29.657 --> 01:22:32.744
I know we haven't
really had a chance to talk.

01:22:35.121 --> 01:22:38.875
I feel horrible
for the way that I behaved,

01:22:38.917 --> 01:22:42.545
and I owe you an explanation.

01:22:42.587 --> 01:22:45.090
-I'm listening.

01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:49.552
-I don't have
a Casey in my family.

01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:51.971
You know,
someone that'll stick up for you

01:22:52.013 --> 01:22:53.807
no matter what.

01:22:53.848 --> 01:22:56.601
Marcus is really lucky.

01:22:56.643 --> 01:23:00.772
And, if you'll let me...

01:23:00.814 --> 01:23:05.568
I'm gonna do my best to become
the man you believed in,

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:08.905
and not the coward
that I have proven myself to be.

01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:11.658
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.785
Don't talk about
my friend like that.

01:23:16.538 --> 01:23:19.082
-Am I the friend?
-Yes, you're the friend.

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:22.127
-Okay.
Alright, come here.

01:23:22.168 --> 01:23:23.837
CASEY: Alright, y'all,
let's get outta here.

01:23:23.878 --> 01:23:25.338
SARAH: Oh, yeah.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.674
CASEY: So, are we actually
set on Justice Warriors?

01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:29.050
PJ: Yes, I'll make T-shirts!

01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:30.468
ELI: I'm not calling myself
a Justice Warrior.

01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:32.345
CASEY: Okay,
let's hold the roll.

01:23:32.387 --> 01:23:34.139
LIAM: It's grown on me,
I mean it.

01:23:35.974 --> 01:23:40.937

01:23:40.979 --> 01:23:45.984
