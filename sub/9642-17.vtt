WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:05.375
Here it comes...
Ahhh!

00:06.833 --> 00:08.750
It's almost my turn.
My turn.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.583
Ahhh!

00:11.583 --> 00:14.250
Now, me! Ahhh!

00:14.250 --> 00:17.166
Who are we kidding? This is
just blowing hot air around.

00:18.708 --> 00:21.125
When is this heat gonna end?

00:21.125 --> 00:23.708
Jerry, honey, we need
an air conditioner.

00:23.708 --> 00:26.875
We don't need air conditioning.
We've got armpit ice.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.458
See, it cools... Oh!

00:30.583 --> 00:33.166
...and deodorizes.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.583
This is the hottest
summer ever.

00:42.583 --> 00:45.250
I was just standing in front
of the air conditioning display

00:45.250 --> 00:47.583
at the hardware store
until Old Man Greenwald

00:47.583 --> 00:49.166
yelled at me for
not buying anything.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.875
So I bought you a screwdriver.
Happy Mother's Day.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.458
Oh, thanks, honey, I...

00:55.458 --> 00:57.958
I can use it to pry open
your father's wallet

00:57.958 --> 01:00.166
and buy us an air conditioner.

01:00.166 --> 01:03.416
Dad, can we please close up
and go to the beach?

01:03.416 --> 01:06.833
No. We are gonna
take advantage of this heat.

01:06.833 --> 01:10.583
We can cook the pastrami without
even turning the oven on.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.000
Justin, you're
hogging the fan.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.208
Harper, you know what this heat
and humidity does to my sinuses.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.458
OK? I have to keep them properly
ventilated or I start to snort.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.875
There it is.

01:22.875 --> 01:27.083
Hey, guys. If anyone's
looking for me, I'll be
outside at the beach.

01:28.458 --> 01:30.583
Oh no, he's delirious.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.416
He must've eaten one of those
pastrami sandwiches you're
cooking on the roof.

01:40.875 --> 01:43.000
From street scene
to beach scene!

01:43.000 --> 01:45.208
Ah, paradise.

01:54.125 --> 01:57.083
Oh, hey, welcome
to my own private beach.

01:59.458 --> 02:02.583
It's, uh... nice,
but it's missing something.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.750
The ocean?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.250
Good point.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.625
Oceans and seas,
waves and tides...

02:13.458 --> 02:17.000
Fine. We'll close up the shop
and go to the beach.

02:18.125 --> 02:20.958

03:22.000 --> 03:23.500
I want to get a good spot
at the beach.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.166
I hope I didn't
forget anything from home.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.458
I know what you forgot, Dad.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.875
The shirt that matches
those shorts.

03:35.458 --> 03:38.500
Oh, those college boys.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.125
They're being so obvious.

03:41.125 --> 03:44.583
- I'm married!
- To me.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.875
This is gonna be so great.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.416
I can't wait to just sit
on the beach and read my book.

03:49.416 --> 03:52.875
Alex, feel free to elbow me
if any cute guys walk by.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.708
Ow! He wasn't that cute.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.500
I'll be down by the water,
convincing Boogie boarders

03:59.500 --> 04:01.625
they should wear helmets
and protective eyewear.

04:01.625 --> 04:05.375
Hey. Hey, man, check it out.
It's a fortune teller machine.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.166
Max, no!

04:08.166 --> 04:10.416
Never get a fortune
from one of these.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.708
For humans, it's
a harmless arcade game,

04:12.708 --> 04:15.416
but for wizards,
the fortunes are very real.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.250
Really? Why?

04:18.250 --> 04:20.708
Because Zelzar is actually
from the wizard world.

04:20.708 --> 04:23.166
If a wizard requests
a fortune from him,

04:23.166 --> 04:25.875
he's required
to give them a real one.

04:25.875 --> 04:29.000
Aw! Now I want one even more.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.583
You really need to work
on your warning speeches.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.500
Listen, you might get
a bad one and then,

04:34.500 --> 04:36.458
there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.125
Stay away from Zelzar.
Do you hear me?

04:38.125 --> 04:40.875
- Fine.
- OK, I got it.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.583
Well, for once a human can
do something a wizard can't.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.958
Yeah.

04:44.958 --> 04:48.166
Uh... Zelzar,

04:48.166 --> 04:50.750
one fake fortune
for a human, please.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.750
Zelzar!

05:00.458 --> 05:02.458
"You are admired by many."

05:04.375 --> 05:06.166
Oh, I don't get it.
This one's true.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.291
Isn't it?

05:19.833 --> 05:22.166
Attention, Boogie boarders!

05:22.166 --> 05:24.166
You are in a rip tide!

05:24.166 --> 05:28.875
Swim parallel!
It's your only chance!

05:28.875 --> 05:30.958
Shut up, old lady!

05:32.875 --> 05:35.000
Mom, you were wrong.
This hat does not look cool.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.833
Harper, yeah, I'd like
to put the barbecue there

05:43.833 --> 05:45.750
so the smoke doesn't
blow back on us.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.083
Oh, OK, I'll move. I just need
a comfy spot to read my book.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.083
Sorry, Harper, but I need
that spot for my umbrella.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.291
I'm gonna tan just my legs.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.708
OK, I'll just find
another comfy spot.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.583
Dad told us not
to get a fortune.

07:01.583 --> 07:04.416
Come on, Justin, he's
just worried about us
getting bad fortunes.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.583
This one's gonna be
a good one. Watch.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.625
"You will receive
a sweet surprise."

07:10.625 --> 07:13.208
Oh, that does sound like
a good one.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.708
Free ice cream?
Thank you!

07:17.708 --> 07:20.000
And it's called
"Sweet Surprise."

07:22.750 --> 07:25.083
These fortunes are
extremely well-detailed.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.166
Yeah, you should
get a fortune.

07:27.166 --> 07:30.416
No, no, no, just because you
got a good one doesn't mean
I'll get a good one, too.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.708
OK, suit yourself.

07:31.708 --> 07:34.750
I mean, I'd like to get a
fortune, but Dad warned us.

07:34.750 --> 07:38.416
But then again, you did get
a good one, and I'd probably
get a good one, too.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.125
Probably.

07:41.458 --> 07:44.125
OK, fine, stop hounding me.
I'm doing it.

07:46.958 --> 07:48.500
Zelzar!

07:52.458 --> 07:55.625
"You will attract
the attention of a stranger."

07:56.625 --> 07:58.750
Hey, stranger.

07:58.750 --> 08:01.166
Did you see that?
She gave me the flirty fingers!

08:02.958 --> 08:05.708
- This is awesome!
- I know.

08:05.708 --> 08:08.166
What are the odds of you
meeting a girl named Stranger?

08:27.458 --> 08:28.875
OK...

08:47.000 --> 08:50.208
Harper, honey, stop playing
with the smoke. It's dangerous.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.166
Oh, the fire's going out.
Harper, give me some pages
from your book.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.500
I'm still reading this.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.875
I'm talking about
the pages you already read.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.500
I haven't read anything yet!

09:03.500 --> 09:06.583
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna go read somewhere
else. Come on, Alex.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.875
OK. Oh, hey, don't
bring that book, though.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.333
People will think we're nerds.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.708
Alex! The Zelzar
machine really works.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.208
Max and I got great fortunes.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.000
Yeah. It told me I was
gonna get a sweet surprise,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.458
and I got a free
ice cream bar.

09:29.458 --> 09:32.583
Oh my gosh! That's
a totally lame coincidence!

09:34.708 --> 09:37.708
Yeah, but my fortune said
I would attract the attention
of a stranger,

09:37.708 --> 09:40.458
and this really pretty
girl waved at me.
And I even got her number.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.625
That machine didn't
give you a fortune,
it gave you a miracle.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
- Alex, you gotta try it.
- All right, give me a quarter.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.958
No, your dad said
wizards shouldn't use it.

09:49.958 --> 09:53.416
Yeah, and if he knew it
could lead to free ice cream,
he'd change his tune.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.375
All right, Alex, now whatever
good stuff you get,

09:56.375 --> 09:58.416
you have to share with us
because we got you to do it.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.083
Zelzar!

10:07.250 --> 10:09.291
"Say goodbye to your life."

10:12.375 --> 10:14.208
You don't have to
share that one with us.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.708
"Say goodbye to your life."

10:26.708 --> 10:29.125
This is not good.
This is really not good.

10:29.125 --> 10:32.125
Now, wait a minute.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

10:32.125 --> 10:35.000
"Say goodbye to your life"
could mean a lot of things.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.291
It could mean...

10:37.375 --> 10:39.083
...your life is ending.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.083
Or your days are numbered.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.458
You're definitely not
getting a sweet surprise.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.708
Sorry, Alex. There's
just no way to spin this

10:50.708 --> 10:52.708
in a positive manner.
What are we gonna do?

10:52.708 --> 10:55.750
Look, I'll handle it like
I handle all of life's problems.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.458
Ignore it until it goes away.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.833
OK? Now, let's get back
to our day on the beach.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.333
Well, that's a little
hard to ignore.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.875
Please, Zelzar. We know
you're from the wizard world.

11:12.875 --> 11:14.291
You have to take back
my fortune.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.958
I don't think he's
gonna talk to us.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.708
Here, let me try.

11:22.583 --> 11:25.583
Hey, hey! Stop that.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.750
Look, young lady wizard,

11:30.750 --> 11:32.708
I'm sorry you got
a fortune you didn't like,

11:32.708 --> 11:35.291
but you know the deal,
so, move along.

11:35.291 --> 11:38.166
There are some tour buses
coming through, and...

11:38.166 --> 11:40.875
...I love out-of-town quarters.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.875
OK, I made a mistake. I know
you're just doing your job,

11:45.875 --> 11:48.875
but I can't say goodbye
to my life forever like
the fortune says,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.333
I'm only 17!

11:54.250 --> 11:55.750
"Boo hoo."

11:57.333 --> 11:59.375
Alex, we'd better
tell your dad.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.958
No, no, Zelzar just
needs a little convincing.

12:01.958 --> 12:03.125
Max, show him the sword.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.416
Hey, Zelzar, I got
a sweet surprise for you.

12:09.416 --> 12:12.458
Alex, Max, you can't scare
a fortune-telling wizard.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.500
No?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.875
All right, all right,
I'll help you!

12:17.500 --> 12:19.000
Scaredy-cat.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.375
Take back my fortune.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.708
I'm not supposed to, but maybe
we could work something out.

12:27.708 --> 12:30.875
You see, for years
I've been watching people
come to the beach,

12:30.875 --> 12:34.083
laugh, eat all sorts of
delicious fried goodies,

12:34.083 --> 12:36.708
meet girls...

12:38.125 --> 12:40.708
...while I sit in this box.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.708
If you let me have some
fun on the beach...

12:44.958 --> 12:46.583
...I'll take back your fortune.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.708
Well, I hope sitting quietly
on the beach and reading a book

12:51.708 --> 12:54.708
isn't on your list,
'cause that's not gonna happen.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.875
OK, you've got a deal.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.875
Why don't you grab your
sun block and loosen up
your genie pants,

13:01.875 --> 13:03.583
because you're about to have
the best day of your life.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.625
One tiny problem.

13:05.625 --> 13:09.583
- I'm not allowed to leave
this machine unattended.
- No problem.

13:09.583 --> 13:12.125
One of my brothers will
take your place in the
machine while we're gone.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.958
Well, it's not gonna be me,
because I get claustrophobic.

13:14.958 --> 13:18.416
It's actually...
quite roomy in here.

13:18.416 --> 13:21.708
I'll do it. I love roomy
claustrophobic places.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.000
All right. Hello, beach.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.958
Here comes Zelzar!

13:27.958 --> 13:30.875
Vise versa.
Max and Zelzar Reverse-a.

13:35.458 --> 13:39.708
Oh, yeah!
Feels good to stretch my legs!

13:39.708 --> 13:41.875
Check it out! I have legs!

13:43.833 --> 13:46.833
Sweet! I have
a mustache and a beard!

13:46.833 --> 13:49.458
And they're itchy, just like
I always dreamed they would be!

13:51.333 --> 13:53.750
Uh, I better stay here with Max.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.875
I have a feeling his fortunes
might come out a little...
Max-ish.

13:59.416 --> 14:03.583
This is so exciting. I...
I don't know what to do first.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.583
Watch out!

14:10.291 --> 14:13.000
Oh my gosh, Alex.
That giant mallet almost
took your head off.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.208
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, for now.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.750
Let's just give this guy
a couple hours on the beach,

14:17.750 --> 14:19.166
so that he can
take back my fortune.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.000
OK, Zelzar, what do you
want to do first?

14:21.000 --> 14:26.708
Use one of these disposable
cameras, so that I can remember
all of this!

14:55.583 --> 14:57.500
Maxar!

14:57.500 --> 15:00.000
Uh, excuse me, sir.
One second.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm the fortune teller
machine quality control...
inspector guy.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.875
Uh, I have to ask you
to stand right there.

15:08.416 --> 15:11.208
"Mustache and beard. Jealous?"

15:15.833 --> 15:19.416
This is actually why I've been
inspecting these machines.

15:19.416 --> 15:20.625
Vague fortunes.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.125
What Zelzar is actually
trying to say,

15:23.125 --> 15:28.500
is that "Jealousy is
a very hairy subject."

15:28.500 --> 15:31.583
So yeah, why don't you go take
a walk and think about that.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.875
"Ouch."

15:46.291 --> 15:50.500
Guys, the beach is so much fun!

15:52.083 --> 15:54.083
Yeah, maybe for you.
She's almost been taken out

15:54.083 --> 15:56.166
by a mallet, a corn dog,
and a seagull.

15:56.166 --> 15:59.416
Yeah, and if we didn't
have all those pictures,
no one would believe it.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.375
OK, Zelzar, you've had
a great time at the beach.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.333
Let's take back my bad fortune.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.208
Not so fast.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.458
I haven't talked
to any beach beauties yet.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.708
What? No. You're not...

16:14.125 --> 16:17.416
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you, Harper.

16:17.416 --> 16:19.375
- That was close.
- A little too close.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.125
One of these near misses
is not going to be a near miss.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.875
Great, where did Zelzar go?

16:24.875 --> 16:27.625
Let's just spread out
and find him.

16:27.625 --> 16:30.583
Nice try, Harper.
You're sticking with me.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.833
Maxar!

16:43.500 --> 16:45.416
Sir, excuse me!
I'm with the machine.

16:49.416 --> 16:51.458
"How do you like my mustache?"

16:52.500 --> 16:54.291
It's quite comical, actually.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.875
What he's trying
to say is that...

16:55.875 --> 16:57.625
Maxar!

16:59.875 --> 17:02.000
"My mustache can beat up
your mustache."

17:03.583 --> 17:06.291
Don't know why I keep
reading these out loud.

17:07.625 --> 17:11.000
Well, sir, why don't
you enjoy. Move right along.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.750
There's a pack of seagulls!
There are several of them!

17:14.750 --> 17:17.458
What is your obsession
with facial hair?

17:17.458 --> 17:21.208
When you become a man...
you'll know.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.083
First time at the beach?

17:33.083 --> 17:38.833
Whoo! It's my first time,
and I am enjoying the view.

17:38.833 --> 17:43.500
I'm... married.

17:45.875 --> 17:50.291
You must have seen my husband
over there barbecuing and
thought he was my personal chef.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.000
I look a lot richer than I am.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.833
Great, we have to get him
away from her before my dad
realizes who he is.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.250
Zelzar, OK, come on. You've
had your time at the beach

18:05.250 --> 18:09.166
and even flirted with a beach
beauty, who is my mom. So gross.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.166
It's time for you
to take back my fortune.

18:11.166 --> 18:15.458
- Alex...
- You've gotta be kidding me!

18:15.458 --> 18:18.166
Come on Zelzar, it's time
to take back my fortune.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.250
Sorry!

18:22.375 --> 18:24.125
You want to tell
your dad now?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.750
Daddy!

18:29.208 --> 18:32.583
I need your help. I got
a fortune from Zelzar,

18:32.583 --> 18:35.208
and he won't take it back
no matter what I do.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.083
I'm sorry, I should have
listened to you.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.875
- Here's what the fortune says.
- "Say goodbye to your life."

18:40.875 --> 18:43.125
Oh,mija.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.583
Yeah, you might not want
to stand so close to her.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.708
Dad, Zelzar said that he
would take back my fortune

18:51.708 --> 18:54.625
if I gave him have a day
at the beach, but he
keeps putting it off.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.500
Look, Zelzar.
My daughter's in danger.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.583
And it sounds like
you made a promise.

19:01.583 --> 19:03.375
And you ate
two of my burgers!

19:03.375 --> 19:06.250
'Cause they are delicious!

19:06.250 --> 19:08.583
Oh, thanks.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.875
The secret is the onion soup mix
is mixed into the meat...

19:11.875 --> 19:14.125
Daddy!

19:14.125 --> 19:16.833
Right! Zelzar,
take her fortune back.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.000
Yeah, about that...

19:19.000 --> 19:21.166
I'm having too much fun
on the beach.

19:21.166 --> 19:23.291
I think I might wait
a while before I...

19:24.958 --> 19:26.416
...get back in that box.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.458
But... that wasn't the deal!

19:34.000 --> 19:37.125
Everyone just needs
to calm down, OK? Calm down!

19:37.125 --> 19:40.416
There's no need to get upset
over a few silly fortunes.

19:40.416 --> 19:42.291
You call this a fortune?

19:42.291 --> 19:45.416
"Grow a beard
and join my beard club."

19:45.416 --> 19:49.583
- What does that even mean?
- Who knows?

19:49.583 --> 19:54.833
Look, if you want to destroy
the thing, fine, destroy it.
I'm not gonna stop you.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.833
Those two are ruining
the fortune-telling business

19:58.833 --> 20:02.458
that I've built up
over the last century.
I gotta get back in there.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.333
OK, I'll put you
back in there,

20:04.333 --> 20:06.125
but you know what
you promised to do.

20:06.125 --> 20:09.000
All right, all right.
I can't erase your fortune,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.875
but I can transfer it
to the next paying customer.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.250
I'm good with that. You?

20:16.250 --> 20:19.583
Yeah. I hope it's
that flying rat.

20:19.583 --> 20:22.875
All right, deal.
Get him back in the box.

20:22.875 --> 20:26.375
I can't do the spell,
there's too many people!

20:26.375 --> 20:28.125
Hey, look, everyone!

20:28.125 --> 20:31.375
That unattended barbecue just
set the lifeguard tower on fire!

20:31.375 --> 20:34.625
Good thinking, Harper.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.000
Actually, I'm not lying.
Your dad's grill tipped over.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.583
- My burgers!
- My book!

20:39.583 --> 20:41.625
My floppy hat!

20:46.125 --> 20:48.875
Wow, that was a blast!

20:51.000 --> 20:52.708
Wait, where's my
beard and mustache?

20:54.333 --> 20:57.125
Here come the firemen.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.958
Guys, I'm married!

21:02.375 --> 21:05.208
You know what?
Let's just go home.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.000
Wait...

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh, no, that little girl's
gonna get my old fortune.
This is horrible.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.958
Zelzar!

21:21.708 --> 21:24.000
Poor girl.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.708
Hang on there,
little girl.

21:25.708 --> 21:29.083
I'm Hal Art, host of
Random Prize Giveaway.

21:29.083 --> 21:32.333
Say goodbye to your life,
because we're randomly
giving you...

21:32.333 --> 21:34.208
...one million dollars!

21:35.416 --> 21:38.583
What? That's my money!
That's my money!

21:38.583 --> 21:40.708
That's my money!
It's mine!

21:44.875 --> 21:47.833
OK, here it comes...
Ohhh!

21:47.833 --> 21:51.875
- OK, my turn.
- Ohhh!

21:51.875 --> 21:53.500
Who needs air conditioning?

21:53.500 --> 21:56.250
Ah... my mustache would've
really enjoyed this.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.125
This is so much better
than a day at the beach.

21:58.125 --> 22:02.166
I'm gonna finish this book,
no matter what.

22:04.458 --> 22:07.625
It broke!
It broke! How do we fix it?

22:07.625 --> 22:09.416
Wait, I'll fix it.
I'll fix it.

22:09.416 --> 22:12.583
Fix the fan, make it right.
Make it blow with all its might.

22:12.583 --> 22:15.333
Great. Thanks, Alex.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.583
- Ah! Oh!
- All right...

22:18.583 --> 22:19.625
- Whoa!
- Wait!

22:19.625 --> 22:21.833
Too much might!
Too much might!

22:21.833 --> 22:23.375
Turn it off!
