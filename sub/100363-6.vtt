WEBVTT

00:07.072 --> 00:09.379
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:09.422 --> 00:10.661
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

00:10.685 --> 00:11.836
You said you don't remember
what happened

00:11.860 --> 00:12.817
when you were possessed,
but Julia does.

00:12.861 --> 00:14.210
And I don't.

00:14.253 --> 00:16.865
I don't know why
you're accusing me of lying.

00:16.908 --> 00:19.955
Eliot, let me out.

00:19.998 --> 00:21.260
We're looking for Stoppard.

00:21.304 --> 00:23.001
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

00:23.045 --> 00:25.134
Moms die every day.
Circle of life.

00:25.177 --> 00:27.025
We know you're trying
to look out for your mom.

00:27.049 --> 00:28.354
You're saying you'll leave?

00:28.398 --> 00:30.095
- Sorry, man.
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:30.139 --> 00:31.967
The Harmonic Convergence.

00:32.009 --> 00:33.708
AKA the end of the world.

00:33.751 --> 00:34.946
The convergence will only occur

00:34.970 --> 00:36.928
during this perfect alignment.

00:36.972 --> 00:39.409
If we move the moon
out of position...

00:39.452 --> 00:42.717
No Convergence,
no Circumstance, no apocalypse.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.023
If you have moon brain,
then you will see her aura.

00:45.067 --> 00:47.112
If it is green,
she is listening.

00:47.156 --> 00:50.855
Only then may you ask her
to move.

00:50.899 --> 00:53.379
You will need a piece of her.
- Like a moon rock?

00:53.423 --> 00:54.859
In here, boss.

00:54.903 --> 00:57.035
Ladies.

00:57.079 --> 00:58.123
You're moving the moon?

00:58.167 --> 00:59.167
Yeah.

01:02.998 --> 01:05.217
Uh, guys?

01:05.260 --> 01:07.306
I think we broke the moon.

01:09.205 --> 01:11.207
NASA estimates just hours

01:11.250 --> 01:13.818
before the first pieces
reach our atmosphere.

01:13.862 --> 01:17.169
In a tweet, the president
stressed the need for calm,

01:17.213 --> 01:20.738
saying, "We will fix
the moon decisively.

01:20.782 --> 01:24.437
The American people have
absolutely nothing to fear."

01:31.227 --> 01:35.231
I know we are dealing
with the lunapocalypse problem,

01:35.274 --> 01:37.973
but I have to insist
that we all take a minute

01:38.016 --> 01:41.150
for a little
self-care/pizza, okay?

01:41.193 --> 01:42.238
Okay.

01:42.281 --> 01:43.979
Cautioning everyone that

01:44.022 --> 01:45.937
though the world appears
to be coming to an end,

01:45.981 --> 01:48.157
everyone's behavior
will still be counted

01:48.200 --> 01:49.941
when the time comes
for judgment.

01:49.985 --> 01:53.249
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

01:53.292 --> 01:55.120
At least
the Harmonic Convergence

01:55.164 --> 01:56.731
isn't happening anymore.

01:59.298 --> 02:02.214
I just have this bad feeling.

02:02.258 --> 02:03.825
Hey.

02:03.868 --> 02:06.741
We'll figure out
how to stop this.

02:06.784 --> 02:09.308
I mean, on the off-chance
the president doesn't.

02:09.352 --> 02:11.136
Let's review.

02:11.180 --> 02:14.096
Emergency code words
if this all goes shit-shaped?

02:14.139 --> 02:16.098
Um...

02:16.141 --> 02:17.316
Really?

02:17.360 --> 02:18.491
Kidding. Okay.

02:19.536 --> 02:20.798
As follows.

02:20.842 --> 02:23.018
"Credenza," no questions asked.

02:23.061 --> 02:24.541
"Inglenook," tie those fools up,

02:24.584 --> 02:26.325
toss 'em through
the Fillory portal.

02:26.369 --> 02:28.110
"Chifforobe," flee to Canada.

02:28.153 --> 02:30.025
"Armoire," shield up, stat.

02:30.068 --> 02:31.287
"Kimono"...

02:31.330 --> 02:32.897
both:
All hell has broken loose.

02:32.941 --> 02:35.857
Time and hope
are quickly running out.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.468
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gonna hit

02:38.511 --> 02:40.818
around 10:00 p.m.

02:40.862 --> 02:42.298
We have 12 hours.

02:46.258 --> 02:47.259
Uh, look.

02:47.303 --> 02:48.497
What if we created
a massive portal

02:48.521 --> 02:49.914
in the atmosphere?

02:49.958 --> 02:51.022
No, we need a specialist,

02:51.046 --> 02:53.962
and the meta-math is just...
it's too...

02:54.005 --> 02:55.833
this is really bad, Julia.

02:55.877 --> 02:57.443
Nuh-uh.

02:57.487 --> 02:59.837
Don't you dare give up.

03:00.969 --> 03:02.448
This math
is so damn frustrating.

03:02.492 --> 03:03.885
Yeah, but you'll get it.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.845
Jesus.

03:07.889 --> 03:09.151
What happened to your shoe?

03:09.194 --> 03:10.369
Have you been out there?

03:10.413 --> 03:12.937
It is the literal end
of the actual world.

03:12.981 --> 03:14.461
No, it's not.
We're gonna stop it.

03:14.504 --> 03:16.854
Yeah, tell that to the
rioters and the prayer circles

03:16.898 --> 03:18.856
and people fucking
in the streets.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.423
I can't believe
this is happening.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.468
I'm just numb.

03:22.512 --> 03:25.167
Try the truffled prosciutto,
it's incredible.

03:27.038 --> 03:29.084
I did have one idea

03:29.127 --> 03:31.303
after my very bad idea
to take the subway.

03:31.347 --> 03:34.306
Okay, do you know Richard's
Reverse Entropy spell?

03:34.350 --> 03:35.457
We already talked about it.

03:35.481 --> 03:36.632
Unfortunately, it's just
way too small.

03:36.656 --> 03:39.137
True, but I reworked it.

03:39.181 --> 03:41.966
And check my math.

03:44.316 --> 03:47.406
This is fantastic, but...

03:47.450 --> 03:50.061
I don't think we have
enough cooperative power.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.324
Chances are high for a surge
in the next 12 hours.

03:52.368 --> 03:53.369
We could use it.

03:53.412 --> 03:54.979
And we have enough hedges

03:55.023 --> 03:59.505
around the world on standby
to do it with us, so...

03:59.549 --> 04:01.464
That might not be enough.

04:01.507 --> 04:02.595
We make it enough.

04:02.639 --> 04:04.380
Today we are saving the world,

04:04.423 --> 04:06.991
and this time it's gonna stick.

04:07.035 --> 04:08.079
Damn right, we are.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.907
Okay.

04:11.648 --> 04:13.519
But just in case...

04:14.607 --> 04:18.046
Anything I need to say to you?

04:18.089 --> 04:19.177
Jules, we're good.

04:22.964 --> 04:24.966
Scientists around the world

04:25.009 --> 04:26.619
have been sending out
their predictions

04:26.663 --> 04:28.534
for what we should expect
in the coming hours.

04:28.578 --> 04:31.189
Though the tides remain
mysteriously intact,

04:31.233 --> 04:33.496
expect volcanic activity,

04:33.539 --> 04:36.542
tectonic shifts,
disrupted weather patterns,

04:36.586 --> 04:39.023
and strange behavior
from animal life.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.116
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade:

04:45.160 --> 04:46.552
I lied.

04:46.596 --> 04:48.946
It was my tampon,
and that was your girlfriend.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.295
I'm not sorry.

04:50.339 --> 04:52.036
Thanks for spreading
the word, Pete.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.124
Stand by.

04:54.604 --> 04:55.997
Everyone's set.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.476
We're just waiting
for the surge.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:10.620 --> 05:12.404
You guys feel that?

05:12.448 --> 05:13.492
It's the surge.

05:13.536 --> 05:15.103
- It's cresting.
- We should...

05:15.146 --> 05:16.931
- Go.
- Pete, now!

05:36.298 --> 05:37.603
Did it work?

05:45.481 --> 05:47.396
It didn't work.

05:47.439 --> 05:49.964
We failed.

06:09.157 --> 06:12.029
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned...

06:12.073 --> 06:13.639
right now.

06:13.683 --> 06:16.164
At least the Harmonic
Convergence

06:16.207 --> 06:17.992
isn't happening anymore.

06:18.035 --> 06:19.558
Although the world's
greatest minds

06:19.602 --> 06:21.473
are locked in a desperate race
to save humanity

06:21.517 --> 06:23.649
from this sudden
lunar cataclysm,

06:23.693 --> 06:26.348
time and hope
are quickly running out.

06:26.391 --> 06:28.152
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

06:28.176 --> 06:29.481
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

06:29.525 --> 06:31.309
We have 12 hours.

06:35.096 --> 06:36.053
Uh, look, what if we created

06:36.097 --> 06:37.533
a massive portal
in the atmosphere?

06:37.576 --> 06:40.057
We need a specialist,
and the meta-math is just...

06:40.101 --> 06:42.407
it's too... this
is really bad, Julia.

06:42.451 --> 06:44.105
Am I crazy, or...

06:44.148 --> 06:45.715
This already happened, right?

06:45.758 --> 06:47.412
This math is so damn
frustrating.

06:47.456 --> 06:48.674
This did.

06:48.718 --> 06:50.502
This did already happen.

06:50.546 --> 06:51.634
Ow!

06:51.677 --> 06:53.157
Not a dream.

06:53.201 --> 06:55.507
Hey, am I on something,

06:55.551 --> 06:57.509
or did we try this plan
yesterday?

06:57.553 --> 06:58.684
We're...

06:58.728 --> 07:00.599
At Westbrook's estate?

07:03.559 --> 07:04.559
Jesus.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.128
What happened to your shoe?

07:07.171 --> 07:09.086
Have you been out there?

07:09.130 --> 07:11.306
It's the literal end
of the actual world.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.264
- No, it's not.
- We're stopping it.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.092
Tell that to the rioters,
prayer circles,

07:15.136 --> 07:17.442
and people fucking
in the streets.

07:17.486 --> 07:20.228
Both:
We're in a time loop.

07:22.273 --> 07:24.101
Excuse us
while we briefly sidebar.

07:26.408 --> 07:28.453
Why exactly is this happening?

07:28.497 --> 07:30.455
- "Why is anything?"
- he asked,

07:30.499 --> 07:32.216
still freaked, 'cause
the last thing he remembers

07:32.240 --> 07:33.806
is all of Earth ending.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.807
It felt so inevitable.

07:34.851 --> 07:35.808
I know.

07:35.852 --> 07:38.115
But why us, now?

07:38.159 --> 07:39.247
Time loop?

07:39.290 --> 07:41.553
Of course we're the chosen ones.

07:41.597 --> 07:42.685
We're us.

07:44.295 --> 07:45.557
Okay, everybody.

07:45.601 --> 07:47.124
What is going on with you two?

07:47.168 --> 07:49.213
Quick recap,
Kady's plan won't work.

07:49.257 --> 07:52.521
We tried it, and the moon
still crashed into the Earth.

07:52.564 --> 07:55.437
- Uh, okay.
- What do you mean, "tried it"?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.569
We suspect we're in a time loop.

07:57.613 --> 07:58.788
How?

07:58.831 --> 08:00.616
Obviously...

08:00.659 --> 08:04.402
the moon's a wily cunt
who doesn't wanna die.

08:04.446 --> 08:05.708
Okay.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.840
All right,
so no reverse entropy.

08:07.884 --> 08:09.538
What do you guys suggest?

08:09.581 --> 08:12.149
We cast Vinnola's
Oxygen Saver on Penny 23,

08:12.193 --> 08:13.498
then he travels to the moon.

08:13.542 --> 08:14.891
It's easier
to do a portal there.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.110
Look, GPS is kinda broken.

08:16.153 --> 08:17.328
I might end up in a wall.

08:17.372 --> 08:20.418
- It's the apocalypse.
- Gonna need you to try.

08:23.813 --> 08:25.380
Fuck all of you.

08:25.423 --> 08:26.423
Fine.

08:31.473 --> 08:33.256
You got this, man.

08:40.785 --> 08:41.787
- Oh... oh, no!
- No!

08:51.623 --> 08:52.581
Okay, forget the moon.

08:52.624 --> 08:54.539
Let's move the Earth.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.280
Kady, get your hedge bitches
on the horn.

08:56.324 --> 08:57.716
We got cooperating to do.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.153
I'm on it.

09:02.199 --> 09:03.157
Okay.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.221
I found a spell that can hold

09:04.245 --> 09:05.645
the pieces in suspension,
we just...

09:05.681 --> 09:08.423
right, good to assume
we can all do sphincter magic?

09:16.518 --> 09:18.476
Could we make this very big?

09:20.478 --> 09:22.306
Mother-shit!

09:22.350 --> 09:23.699
You... you okay?

09:23.742 --> 09:26.484
- No, Julia.
- I'm not okay.

09:26.528 --> 09:27.528
Bless you.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.575
Whoa.

09:30.619 --> 09:31.794
Allow me to explain.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.318
So here we are, eight loops in.

09:34.362 --> 09:35.928
Ten.

09:35.972 --> 09:37.645
If these loops sent us back
even a little earlier,

09:37.669 --> 09:39.497
we could stop Marina
from bad-touching

09:39.541 --> 09:41.586
this whole situation,
but we can't.

09:41.630 --> 09:42.979
Okay, so we need time magic.

09:43.022 --> 09:44.763
I know a horomancer
who builds machines.

09:44.807 --> 09:45.764
Maybe he has something.

09:45.808 --> 09:47.331
Fantastic, vámanos.

09:47.375 --> 09:48.767
One problem...

09:48.811 --> 09:51.205
I kind of let his mom die
last time I saw him.

09:51.248 --> 09:52.249
Oh.

09:53.555 --> 09:54.991
Oh, come on.

09:55.034 --> 09:56.862
Like you guys are all saints?

09:56.906 --> 09:59.300
You're in a time loop?

09:59.343 --> 10:00.562
Well, why you two?

10:00.605 --> 10:01.563
'Cause we're the best-looking.

10:01.606 --> 10:02.651
Here.

10:02.694 --> 10:04.740
This is Penny's address.

10:04.783 --> 10:05.804
Margo, what are you doing?

10:05.828 --> 10:07.438
Favorite coffee shop,

10:07.482 --> 10:09.571
hipster club where we suspect
he DJ's on the weekend,

10:09.614 --> 10:11.834
and it's your lucky day...
his Travelling's borked,

10:11.877 --> 10:13.662
so he's a sitting duck
in a scarf.

10:13.705 --> 10:15.881
Margo, we can't just kill Penny.

10:15.925 --> 10:18.536
We don't; he dies anyway,
along with everyone.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.756
This is basic
trolley problem shit.

10:20.799 --> 10:21.800
Ovary up.

10:21.844 --> 10:22.888
Okay.

10:22.932 --> 10:24.368
If I wanted revenge on Penny,

10:24.412 --> 10:26.457
I would've gotten that
a long time ago.

10:30.331 --> 10:33.377
You've got particles
all over you.

10:33.421 --> 10:34.615
Were you spritzed
with something?

10:34.639 --> 10:35.945
Spritzed, like with what?

10:35.988 --> 10:37.555
Something that nebulized

10:37.599 --> 10:39.383
a cloud of temporal permanence
around you?

10:39.427 --> 10:40.906
Mm.

10:40.950 --> 10:42.604
Both: "Permanence."

10:43.953 --> 10:45.433
For men and women.

10:45.476 --> 10:47.565
Yeah, I may have
accidentally stolen

10:47.609 --> 10:50.873
a weird perfume bottle
from a time witch in Fillory.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.744
Okay, whatever you really did,

10:52.788 --> 10:54.268
it's created a field
around you both

10:54.311 --> 10:56.357
that would explain why you're...

10:56.400 --> 10:57.358
in a time loop.

10:57.401 --> 10:58.489
Ah.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.933
And here we thought
we were special.

11:00.970 --> 11:03.755
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

11:03.799 --> 11:05.298
You said it's the end
of the world, right?

11:05.322 --> 11:06.410
That is right.

11:06.454 --> 11:07.933
I think I can hop you guys back

11:07.977 --> 11:10.414
a full 48 hours so you can
prevent this.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.068
Oh, really? Just like that?

11:12.111 --> 11:14.679
Well, it's really
goddamn complicated,

11:14.723 --> 11:16.290
but I'm a genius.

11:17.682 --> 11:19.075
- Oh.
- Oh.

11:19.118 --> 11:21.425
Here we go.

11:24.472 --> 11:26.300
Are we time traveling right now?

11:28.519 --> 11:29.607
The hell?

11:29.651 --> 11:31.609
What's wrong?

11:31.653 --> 11:34.438
Nothing's working... at all.

11:34.482 --> 11:35.720
Are you saying
your shit's broken?

11:35.744 --> 11:36.701
I hope so.

11:36.745 --> 11:38.007
The alternative is...

11:38.050 --> 11:40.314
all time magic's
in some kind of lockdown.

11:40.357 --> 11:41.445
What could even do that?

11:41.489 --> 11:43.665
Something powerful...

11:43.708 --> 11:44.666
and ancient.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.798
You mean like the moon?

11:46.842 --> 11:50.324
Maybe if I just fix this
and bypass the oscillation...

11:50.367 --> 11:51.760
Hey, no rush, but in 30 seconds,

11:51.803 --> 11:53.718
we're all gonna die.

11:53.762 --> 11:54.806
This'll get you there.

11:54.850 --> 11:56.373
Not in one piece, but...

11:56.417 --> 11:57.766
Wait, what?

11:59.724 --> 12:01.509
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

12:01.552 --> 12:02.552
Oh, well.

12:07.969 --> 12:09.120
I cannot believe
we didn't consider

12:09.144 --> 12:10.537
going to Jane Chatwin first.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.582
Well, she is a person
that may be upset with us.

12:12.626 --> 12:14.236
Yes.

12:16.325 --> 12:17.935
- No.
- Huh.

12:17.979 --> 12:19.372
Time magic's locked down,

12:19.415 --> 12:22.201
and the portal
to Fillory's blocked.

12:22.244 --> 12:25.117
This smacks of
a not-so-random coincidence.

12:27.554 --> 12:29.077
Okay.

12:29.121 --> 12:31.297
We can still get there.
Penny can't do shit.

12:31.340 --> 12:33.014
What about that other
Traveller dickbucket,

12:33.038 --> 12:34.363
- Gavin what's-his-name?
- Everything I'm seeing

12:34.387 --> 12:36.191
says the first chunk's
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...

12:36.215 --> 12:39.000
We know!
12 hours.

12:39.044 --> 12:41.481
- We're seeing this wrong.
- We're missing something.

12:41.524 --> 12:44.049
Uh, maybe we need
to take a step back.

12:44.092 --> 12:45.920
Start thinking outside the box.

12:45.963 --> 12:48.836
- What do you suggest?
- Remember Professor Soto?

12:48.879 --> 12:51.099
- Oh, the one with the pants?
- Yeah.

12:51.143 --> 12:52.448
He had that ridiculous test

12:52.492 --> 12:53.971
everyone thought was impossible.

12:54.015 --> 12:55.253
That we solved because we rule.

12:55.277 --> 12:57.192
- Solved how?
- You want me to remember

12:57.236 --> 12:59.020
a solution I came up with
at a rager

12:59.064 --> 13:01.153
doing upside-down shots
in a fur bikini?

13:01.196 --> 13:02.980
You say rager,

13:03.024 --> 13:05.331
I say problem-solving session.

13:05.374 --> 13:08.508
That's how we do: we put our
minds on something different

13:08.551 --> 13:11.163
and we catch the solution out
of the corner of our eye.

13:11.206 --> 13:12.338
So is this actually a plan

13:12.381 --> 13:13.532
or do you just wanna
blow off steam?

13:13.556 --> 13:15.341
Two birds, Bambi.

13:15.384 --> 13:18.344
Besides, we're stuck in a game
that keeps hitting reset.

13:18.387 --> 13:21.521
Infinite time,
zero consequences.

13:21.564 --> 13:23.305
Just you and me saving the world

13:23.349 --> 13:24.915
through unbridled hedonism.

13:24.959 --> 13:28.310
Mm, fun.
Let's do it.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.923
Eliot.

13:34.403 --> 13:35.491
Hey.

13:35.535 --> 13:37.058
Uh, hey.

13:37.102 --> 13:38.383
Did someone just knock
on the door?

13:38.407 --> 13:40.061
We going?

13:42.107 --> 13:43.108
Yeah.

13:45.588 --> 13:48.374
Okay, miscreants.

13:48.791 --> 13:51.272
It's Armageddon.
So die as you lived...

13:51.315 --> 13:52.578
Boring.

13:52.621 --> 13:53.990
Or join us in an
end-of-the-world soiree

13:54.014 --> 13:55.581
and die legends.

13:55.624 --> 13:56.582
Your choice.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.671
You heard the man.

14:00.629 --> 14:01.978
Come on!

14:04.024 --> 14:05.504
It's a tie!

14:05.547 --> 14:06.983
Anything?

14:07.027 --> 14:08.768
Not yet!

14:11.379 --> 14:12.379
Oh!

14:24.827 --> 14:26.089
♪ Gimme your control

14:27.613 --> 14:28.788
Mmm.

14:28.831 --> 14:29.831
Eliot!

14:33.532 --> 14:35.969
- El, El.
- You look like you saw a ghost.

14:36.012 --> 14:38.449
Hey, ask it
how we stop the moon.

14:38.493 --> 14:39.949
- Actually, I think I might...
- Wait!

14:39.973 --> 14:42.584
Oh, my God,
I think I got something.

14:42.628 --> 14:44.499
An idea.

14:44.543 --> 14:45.543
Hit me.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.982
Cock and balls, I forgot.

15:03.039 --> 15:05.694
This isn't working.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.609
No offense, Rajit.

15:07.653 --> 15:08.653
It's Todd.

15:09.655 --> 15:10.656
No.

15:10.699 --> 15:12.048
Come back when you're Rajit.

15:12.092 --> 15:14.616
Okay.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.009
You know, I've been thinking...

15:16.052 --> 15:17.932
clearly we need something
a little bit stronger.

15:17.967 --> 15:19.534
No, we need an idea.

15:19.578 --> 15:20.796
You know what?

15:20.840 --> 15:23.146
I'm gonna go hydrate
and, I don't know...

15:23.190 --> 15:25.975
stare at moon chunks hurtling
straight for Earth.

15:26.019 --> 15:27.760
Can't be worse than discovering

15:27.803 --> 15:30.414
I just jacked Todd off
for three time loops in a row.

15:33.983 --> 15:36.769
Eliot.

15:37.987 --> 15:39.554
No...

15:39.598 --> 15:42.688
It's never happening.

15:42.731 --> 15:45.647
Leave me alone.

15:47.606 --> 15:50.783
♪ I never, never, never,
get so close ♪

15:50.826 --> 15:53.133

16:12.152 --> 16:15.895
I can walk away
from you all fucking day!

16:17.897 --> 16:20.421
Pardon me, Brenda.
I'm gonna get this.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.607
I got a lead.

16:32.651 --> 16:34.696
I've been talking
to this weird oceanographer guy

16:34.740 --> 16:36.219
who no joke has a dolphin harem,

16:36.263 --> 16:39.701
but he also knows
some real shit about...

16:39.745 --> 16:41.529
Hey, what's up with you?

16:41.572 --> 16:42.704
What's up?

16:42.748 --> 16:44.706
Is...

16:44.750 --> 16:48.710
my brain is a snake
eating its tail,

16:48.754 --> 16:51.234
and the tail is another snake
eating its tail.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.584
- Jesus.
- Okay, you stay here.

16:53.628 --> 16:56.065
I'll report back
with some research.

17:08.121 --> 17:10.601
I figured it out, El.

17:10.645 --> 17:13.647
From talking
to that dolphin fucker.

17:13.692 --> 17:16.172
Everything he said checked out.

17:16.215 --> 17:19.567
We need to go to Fisher Beach.
It's kind of out of the way.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.961
Lifeguard station 17.

17:23.570 --> 17:24.809
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's

17:24.833 --> 17:26.574
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...
Eliot.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.968
- We have 12 hours.
- Hey.

17:29.011 --> 17:31.187
I got the answer.
You can take a breather.

17:31.231 --> 17:33.276
Not right now, Margo.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.278
Okay, "Leaving Las Vegas."

17:35.322 --> 17:36.889
I was happy to give you space

17:36.932 --> 17:39.021
to tell your Monster secrets
in your own time,

17:39.065 --> 17:41.981
but we're stuck
in the Jean Paul Sarte bullshit

17:42.024 --> 17:43.634
and you're getting worse fast.

17:43.678 --> 17:45.612
I told you, this isn't
important right now, okay?

17:45.636 --> 17:46.855
Whatever it is,

17:46.899 --> 17:48.683
you remember
it's not your fault, okay?

17:48.727 --> 17:50.685
This math is
so damn frustrating.

17:50.729 --> 17:52.861
Can we just stop
the moon first, please?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.825
Not if your liver
falls out of your twat first.

17:54.863 --> 17:56.125
Let's talk about it.

17:56.169 --> 17:57.257
No.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.651
- Seems like we have to.
- It's me.

18:00.695 --> 18:01.740
Don't be a coward.

18:01.783 --> 18:03.263
Stop.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.659
It's still in me, okay?

18:13.708 --> 18:16.319
I am seeing what I am seeing.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.147
Some pieces of him
must've held on.

18:18.191 --> 18:20.019
The Monster is gone.

18:20.062 --> 18:22.848
I exorcised it
and Q threw it into the Seam.

18:22.891 --> 18:24.937
The only thing here
is you medicating

18:24.980 --> 18:28.201
instead of facing
your memories and your feelings

18:28.244 --> 18:30.769
and I empathize, I do.

18:30.812 --> 18:33.772
But I think you're forgetting
you can tell me anything.

18:33.815 --> 18:37.819
I just told you,
and you didn't believe me.

18:37.863 --> 18:39.560
I love you.

18:39.603 --> 18:41.257
Even when you're nuts.

18:41.301 --> 18:43.303
But our window's 12 hours
to stop the moon

18:43.346 --> 18:45.044
or it's game over again,

18:45.087 --> 18:47.873
and I need it to be fixed
before I go as nuts as you,

18:47.916 --> 18:49.570
so just sit this round out...

18:49.613 --> 18:50.919
- No.
- And I'll go alone.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.268
- No, no, no.
- Please, please.

18:52.312 --> 18:53.704
I can...

18:53.748 --> 18:55.141
You can't.

18:55.184 --> 18:56.814
Keep it together,
I can keep it together.

18:56.838 --> 18:58.598
- See you yesterday.
- I can keep it together.

18:58.622 --> 19:00.929
Please.
No, Margo.

19:30.916 --> 19:33.701
I'm feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

19:33.744 --> 19:35.355
Okay.

19:35.398 --> 19:37.270
I'm sorry.

19:37.313 --> 19:39.141
What you said yesterday...

19:39.185 --> 19:40.882
Yesterday at Westbrook's house?

19:47.323 --> 19:50.109
Yesterday before you went
to Fisher Beach.

19:50.152 --> 19:53.286
I didn't go to Fisher Beach.

19:53.329 --> 19:55.941
- You don't...
- At around 10 p.m.

19:55.984 --> 19:58.639
- We have 12 hours.
- You don't remember.

19:58.682 --> 20:00.119
Remember that tit-chafe Marina

20:00.162 --> 20:02.382
showed up and broke the moon?
How could I forget?

20:05.820 --> 20:08.823
Did Josh just sneeze
on the pizza?

20:16.276 --> 20:17.799
So let's release that ache,

20:17.843 --> 20:20.324
that desire for control.

20:20.367 --> 20:25.528
Understand the moment we're in.
Accept our state of being.

20:25.577 --> 20:27.448
Take a breath.

20:27.492 --> 20:30.626
Send a prayer up to the god
of your understanding.

20:30.669 --> 20:33.759
Send a prayer and accept.
Amen.

20:33.803 --> 20:36.457
- Amen,
- Thank you.

20:36.501 --> 20:40.505
You've momentarily lessened
my existential dread.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.512
This may be the end.

20:47.556 --> 20:50.384
No, I'm not reading this.

20:50.428 --> 20:52.648
Okay, asshole.

20:52.691 --> 20:54.388
Bring it.

20:54.432 --> 20:56.521
I just wanna say...

20:57.783 --> 21:02.396
This world is flawed.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.791
We each have good in us...
and bad.

21:05.835 --> 21:08.620
Every day we fight
to let the good win.

21:08.664 --> 21:11.492
This... this is the last day.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.407
Think about those who you love.

21:13.451 --> 21:15.801
Turn off the TV
and be with them.

21:15.845 --> 21:16.845
Thank you and good...

21:20.066 --> 21:21.502
I'm sorry.

21:21.546 --> 21:23.504
Were you listening to that?

21:23.548 --> 21:25.942
It was so depressing.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.639
Not really.

21:27.683 --> 21:29.554
Hey, you okay?

21:29.598 --> 21:30.555
Not really.

21:30.599 --> 21:32.644
Me neither.

21:32.688 --> 21:35.342
Cookie?

21:35.386 --> 21:36.648
Yeah.

21:39.042 --> 21:41.000
I have to admit...

21:41.044 --> 21:42.828
I don't think their spell
will work.

21:42.872 --> 21:45.788
It won't.

21:45.831 --> 21:48.704
Can't believe I'm about to die.

21:48.747 --> 21:51.707
You are, but...

21:51.750 --> 21:54.971
then you'll just
start all over again.

21:57.103 --> 21:59.366
We're in a time loop.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.977
Shut up.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.544
Seriously?

22:03.588 --> 22:04.850
That's a relief.

22:04.894 --> 22:07.853
Like, uh, "Groundhog Day"?

22:07.897 --> 22:09.420
Or "Russian Doll"?

22:09.463 --> 22:11.988
Or "Happy Death Day"
or "Happy Death Day 2U"?

22:12.031 --> 22:13.076
Or "Source Code"?

22:13.119 --> 22:15.687
Oh, that "X-Files".
The "Star Trek".

22:15.731 --> 22:17.994
"Edge of Tomorrow" but really
"All You Need Is Kill"

22:18.037 --> 22:20.866
and it's, like, why change
the title like that, right?

22:20.910 --> 22:22.433
Wow.

22:22.476 --> 22:24.783
You really love
time loop stories, don't you?

22:24.827 --> 22:26.437
And you're awake in the loop.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.787
You're the hero.
I am totally jealous.

22:32.922 --> 22:35.576
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

22:35.620 --> 22:37.491
I've got this place
on my bucket list

22:37.535 --> 22:39.972
and well, uh...
it's gotta be now.

22:40.016 --> 22:43.106
- And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade: I lied.

22:43.149 --> 22:44.934
- Man.
- It was my tampon,

22:44.977 --> 22:47.153
- and that was your girlfriend.
- Time loops.

22:47.197 --> 22:49.025
Gnarly.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.462
Extremely gnarly.

22:51.505 --> 22:52.744
So you're talking
to me about it.

22:52.768 --> 22:55.596
Yeah.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.035
As opposed
to Alice, Julia, or Kady.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.124
Or, to state the obvious,

23:01.167 --> 23:02.734
Margo.

23:02.778 --> 23:05.737
I kind of blew it
beyond repair with Margo.

23:05.781 --> 23:07.173
How is anything beyond repair

23:07.217 --> 23:10.220
when you're stuck
in a time loop?

23:10.263 --> 23:11.743
Well,

23:11.787 --> 23:14.528
she was awake with me
for a while and then

23:14.572 --> 23:19.098
she got kicked out somehow,
and now I am utterly alone.

23:19.142 --> 23:21.144
Well, if I'm learning anything

23:21.187 --> 23:23.755
from these squishy pierogi tacos

23:23.799 --> 23:25.539
is that not everything
belongs together.

23:28.151 --> 23:29.935
How can we help?

23:29.979 --> 23:32.068
Help save the world?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.941
Honestly, I don't know.

23:35.985 --> 23:38.988
It might not be possible.

23:39.031 --> 23:41.512
This might be it.

23:41.555 --> 23:46.125
Me, alone,
in this particular 12 hours.

23:46.169 --> 23:47.910
Eternally.

23:47.953 --> 23:49.128
Okay.

23:49.172 --> 23:51.957
Sounds like a lot for you.

23:52.001 --> 23:55.961
So, uh, anything I can do
to help you?

23:56.005 --> 23:58.485
I wish.

23:58.529 --> 24:00.836
Because the longer this goes
on, the more certain I am

24:00.879 --> 24:03.795
that the Monster is inside
of me and trying to get out.

24:03.839 --> 24:06.276
Good metaphor.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.973
I'm being literal.

24:08.017 --> 24:09.801
Oh.

24:09.845 --> 24:10.845
Shit.

24:12.630 --> 24:14.023
It's worse every loop.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.590
I hear its voice,

24:16.634 --> 24:18.767
I see blood on the walls,

24:18.810 --> 24:21.857
I... I see this door.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.989
It wants out.

24:24.033 --> 24:25.817
Have you tried letting it out?

24:25.861 --> 24:27.819
Why in God's name
would I do that?

24:27.863 --> 24:29.255
I... I... I'm just spitballing.

24:29.299 --> 24:32.128
A lot of the time
in these movies

24:32.171 --> 24:33.999
the solution of the problem

24:34.043 --> 24:37.742
is facing the thing
you're most afraid of.

24:37.786 --> 24:40.571
What if I die?

24:40.614 --> 24:41.920
What if you do?

24:49.928 --> 24:52.278
Why?!

24:52.322 --> 24:54.803
Anyway.

24:54.846 --> 24:57.022
You're not upset
you're about to die?

25:00.069 --> 25:03.202
I don't love it.

25:03.246 --> 25:05.596
But you'll figure out a way
to fix this.

25:13.038 --> 25:14.866
The world's greatest minds

25:14.910 --> 25:16.061
are locked in a desperate race
to save humanity.

25:16.085 --> 25:17.695
Everything I'm seeing says

25:17.738 --> 25:19.194
the first chunk's gotta hit
around 10 p.m.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.786
We have 12 hours.

25:23.701 --> 25:25.679
What if we create a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

25:25.703 --> 25:26.922
We'd need a specialist.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.288
Charlton?

26:29.332 --> 26:30.420
Well, fuck!

26:37.244 --> 26:39.420
How the hell are you here?

26:39.464 --> 26:42.205
I was trapped
wandering your Remembrances

26:42.249 --> 26:45.121
when mercifully you decided
not to sleep for five days

26:45.165 --> 26:46.645
and broke your brain.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.299
That gave me an opening
to contact you.

26:49.343 --> 26:51.171
That voice?

26:51.214 --> 26:52.520
That was you?

26:52.564 --> 26:54.304
Yes, of course.

26:54.348 --> 26:56.176
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

26:56.219 --> 26:58.396
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place,

26:58.439 --> 27:01.094
and, well... here we are.

27:02.356 --> 27:04.576
This place was so vivid
in your mind,

27:04.619 --> 27:07.666
but there is nothing
like the real thing, is there?

27:07.709 --> 27:11.452
The sights, the sounds, the...

27:11.496 --> 27:12.627
smells!

27:12.671 --> 27:16.414
Oh, I forgot about smells,
Eliot.

27:16.457 --> 27:18.285
They're overwhelmingly
unpleasant.

27:18.328 --> 27:21.375
- Those messages?
- That was you, too?

27:21.419 --> 27:24.509
"I'm still here"?
"Let me out"?

27:24.552 --> 27:25.597
Yes.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.381
I wanted you to know

27:27.425 --> 27:28.837
that I was still here
and I wanted to be let out.

27:28.861 --> 27:31.516
In red paint?

27:31.559 --> 27:33.692
Right, like strawberries
and Santa Claus.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.433
And blood, Charlton.

27:35.476 --> 27:37.130
Well, perhaps
it was a touch ominous.

27:37.173 --> 27:38.566
As was the creepy whisper.

27:38.610 --> 27:39.674
I was trying to be polite.

27:39.698 --> 27:40.742
Well...

27:43.571 --> 27:46.400
It is nice to have a
non-imaginary imaginary friend

27:46.444 --> 27:47.793
for the end of the world,
I guess.

27:47.836 --> 27:49.229
Half-imaginary.

27:49.272 --> 27:52.232
I was passenger
in your unconscious.

27:52.275 --> 27:56.497
Now, I'm still in your head.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.543
But the conscious part?

27:58.586 --> 28:01.720
I can't tell you how much
of an improvement this is.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.548
Your Happy Place is nice

28:03.591 --> 28:06.376
and I was able to see
everything you were doing here,

28:06.420 --> 28:08.335
but...

28:08.378 --> 28:11.338
well, there's no substitute
for being heard.

28:11.381 --> 28:13.272
Especially since I often
disagree with your choices,

28:13.296 --> 28:14.733
and I'd like
to share my opinions.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.561
Oh, that's peachy.

28:16.604 --> 28:18.301
Well, let's start now.

28:20.303 --> 28:23.263
Opinion on what to do next?

28:23.306 --> 28:25.134
Oh, well, I'd think
that's obvious.

28:25.178 --> 28:27.180
Is it?

28:27.223 --> 28:28.660
In case you didn't notice,

28:28.703 --> 28:30.768
Margo was sort of driving
the bus on this whole thing

28:30.792 --> 28:32.490
before I screwed up
and lost her.

28:32.533 --> 28:34.753
You didn't lose her, Eliot.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.624
She's out of the loops,
Charlton.

28:36.668 --> 28:39.888
No, I simply mean
I don't think that's about you.

28:39.932 --> 28:43.762
I think she got too close
to the answer.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.459
Perhaps that's why

28:45.503 --> 28:49.158
she was thrown from
your shared loop experience.

28:49.202 --> 28:51.813
That does have
the ring of logic to it.

28:51.857 --> 28:53.902
Margo mentioned a beach,
did she not?

28:53.946 --> 28:56.383
Fisher Beach.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.735
Okay.

29:00.779 --> 29:02.215
Let's go.

29:02.258 --> 29:04.913
Why is there no one here?

29:04.957 --> 29:06.480
I think it's a

29:06.524 --> 29:09.135
cancel-your-beach-trip
kind of day today.

29:09.178 --> 29:10.615
Psst... keep your eyes peeled

29:10.658 --> 29:13.661
for anyone or anything
who might not want us here.

29:17.970 --> 29:20.363
Is that phone wire?

29:25.586 --> 29:27.849
Are phones generally used
underwater?

29:33.376 --> 29:35.335
I think we got a lead.

29:35.378 --> 29:36.945
Lifeguard station 17.

29:36.989 --> 29:38.381
That's the same track
Margo was on.

29:38.425 --> 29:39.861
This didn't go well for her,

29:39.905 --> 29:41.535
so perhaps we should discuss
before going in there, okay?

29:41.559 --> 29:43.430
Ovary up, Charlton.

29:53.571 --> 29:56.661
Uh...

29:56.704 --> 29:57.836
I guess...

29:57.879 --> 30:00.839
off and whales?

30:02.014 --> 30:04.538
What is the
purpose of this distraction?

30:04.582 --> 30:06.845
With whom are we speaking?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.890
We are the whales.

30:08.934 --> 30:11.501
Like...

30:11.545 --> 30:12.981
all of them?

30:13.025 --> 30:14.722
Of course.

30:14.766 --> 30:17.290
Why do you speak through a TV?

30:17.333 --> 30:18.683
Why do you?

30:18.726 --> 30:20.293
What is the nature
of your query?

30:20.336 --> 30:22.774
Okay, I don't really know
how to explain this.

30:22.817 --> 30:24.645
Um...

30:24.689 --> 30:26.778
okay, so you probably don't
know this but we...

30:26.821 --> 30:28.649
we are in a time loop.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.869
We are aware of the disturbance.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.784
Oh, huh.

30:32.827 --> 30:35.003
Whales grok time loops.

30:36.004 --> 30:37.876
So do you happen to remember

30:37.919 --> 30:39.965
if a woman named Margo
came to see you?

30:40.008 --> 30:43.533
Uh, brilliant, about yea high,
maybe a little brusque.

30:43.577 --> 30:45.448
A contemptuous creature.

30:45.492 --> 30:47.973
We were compelled to wash away
her temporal immunity.

30:48.016 --> 30:51.585
You took her Permanence off.

30:51.629 --> 30:52.891
Why?

30:52.934 --> 30:55.850
Her manner was appalling.

30:55.894 --> 30:58.287
That...

30:58.331 --> 31:00.681
does sound like Margo, okay.

31:00.725 --> 31:03.553
I apologize for her bedside
manner, and I just...

31:03.597 --> 31:07.645
I humbly and I respectfully
ask, do you...

31:07.688 --> 31:10.822
do you have any insight
into this loop that we're in?

31:10.865 --> 31:12.824
Our magic caused it.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.957
You're... magicians?

31:16.001 --> 31:20.919
- Pay attention!
- We will explain once.

31:20.962 --> 31:23.661
Our ancestors made a pact
with the Old Gods

31:23.704 --> 31:25.314
and so we spend our lives

31:25.358 --> 31:27.447
tracing sigils
into the ocean floor.

31:27.490 --> 31:29.971
This task is crucial.

31:31.799 --> 31:33.453
Why?

31:33.496 --> 31:37.587
To ensure the Kraken
stays dormant.

31:37.631 --> 31:39.372
Like the...

31:39.415 --> 31:40.634
the Kraken-kraken?

31:40.678 --> 31:42.418
What's a Kraken-kraken?

31:42.462 --> 31:43.898
Should the Kraken ever awaken

31:43.942 --> 31:46.945
it would soon consume the world.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.774
Okay, got it.

31:49.817 --> 31:52.341
So, the loops.
Why?

31:52.385 --> 31:53.778
The moon colliding with Earth

31:53.821 --> 31:55.649
obliterated
our protective sigils

31:55.693 --> 31:57.738
causing the Kraken to rise.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.350
Kinda seems like a hat on a hat

32:01.394 --> 32:02.893
when you've already
got a moon apocalypse.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.440
A bit flippant for a creature

32:04.484 --> 32:07.530
who caused said apocalypse.

32:07.574 --> 32:10.403
Fortunately, our ancestors
implemented a failsafe.

32:10.446 --> 32:13.014
If the Kraken awakens,
it sends Earth back 12 hours

32:13.058 --> 32:16.801
to allow another chance
to avert catastrophe.

32:16.844 --> 32:19.412
Whereupon it'll
all just keep happening

32:19.455 --> 32:21.588
because the fucking moon
is broken.

32:21.631 --> 32:23.503
So it would seem.

32:23.546 --> 32:25.766
Well... uh... well,
if you're... if you're magicians,

32:25.810 --> 32:28.638
then maybe you can help
fix the moon?

32:28.682 --> 32:29.814
We cannot.

32:29.857 --> 32:31.772
We must maintain our sigils.

32:31.816 --> 32:33.426
Okay.

32:33.469 --> 32:36.821
If you don't fix the moon,
the Kraken's just...

32:36.864 --> 32:38.692
just gonna keep krakening.

32:38.736 --> 32:40.694
This distraction
has gone on too long.

32:40.738 --> 32:41.956
Wait... no, no, no.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.566
We must attend to the sigils.

32:43.610 --> 32:44.567
- Hold on.
- Do not contact us again.

32:44.611 --> 32:45.655
No, no, no, no, no.

32:45.699 --> 32:46.874
No!

32:46.918 --> 32:49.747
Uh...

32:49.790 --> 32:50.878
oh, shit.

32:55.646 --> 32:58.866
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

32:59.674 --> 33:01.415
Oh, okay.

33:01.458 --> 33:05.419
Bye, I guess.

33:07.508 --> 33:09.379
What am I supposed to do?

33:09.423 --> 33:11.468
I can't fix the moon.
That won't work.

33:11.512 --> 33:14.341
You can't help,
you're non-corporeal.

33:14.384 --> 33:15.690
True.

33:19.041 --> 33:21.652
But...

33:21.696 --> 33:23.524
you're not alone.

33:26.701 --> 33:30.182
So whales really are
powerful magicians.

33:30.226 --> 33:32.184
I knew they did weird stuff
on the ocean floor,

33:32.228 --> 33:33.185
I just didn't realize it was...

33:33.229 --> 33:34.448
- Wait.
- Yes, Alice...

33:34.491 --> 33:36.101
tell me what else
you know about whales.

33:36.145 --> 33:37.799
Um...

33:37.842 --> 33:39.670
their closest cousin
is the hippo.

33:39.714 --> 33:42.369
Um, their mating season
is in the fall.

33:42.412 --> 33:43.761
That is so sad for them.

33:43.805 --> 33:45.435
What if they never get
to make love again?

33:45.459 --> 33:46.808
Though I am one to talk.

33:46.851 --> 33:48.220
I mean, it's been
over a thousand years.

33:48.244 --> 33:49.637
That's not exactly
what I needed.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.595
Well, you asked me what I knew.

33:51.639 --> 33:53.423
Is there any info
about the Kraken

33:53.467 --> 33:55.077
that might point us
in a direction?

33:55.120 --> 33:56.644
- Whoa-ho-ho!
- Okay.

33:56.687 --> 34:01.257
Well, you have your
Lovecraftian god-Krakens.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.780
Uh, and then there's the

34:02.824 --> 34:05.217
D&D Kraken
which is sort of six-of-one.

34:05.261 --> 34:08.438
And then, of course,
there's "Clash of the Titans",

34:08.482 --> 34:09.786
both the original

34:09.831 --> 34:10.851
- and the remake.
- Thank you.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.703
With the very famous line...

34:12.746 --> 34:14.226
Thank you, Josh.

34:15.358 --> 34:16.793
Every time the Kraken awakens,

34:16.838 --> 34:18.447
time jumps back 12 hours.

34:18.492 --> 34:19.730
Which would be great
if it took us back

34:19.754 --> 34:21.408
to before the moon broke.

34:22.321 --> 34:24.149
What if we

34:24.193 --> 34:27.152
get the time loop spell to
trigger a couple hours early?

34:27.196 --> 34:29.416
Why don't we
just kill all the damn whales?

34:29.458 --> 34:31.547
Well, that's clearly
what you tried to do

34:31.592 --> 34:33.202
when they took away
your Permanence.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.246
But she's right.

34:35.291 --> 34:38.337
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.862
Maybe we need to, uh, to...

34:40.905 --> 34:42.254
Release the Kraken!

34:42.297 --> 34:44.561
Exactly, yeah.

34:44.605 --> 34:46.170
But earlier.

34:46.215 --> 34:49.871
Early... early enough
to a time before the heist.

34:49.914 --> 34:51.742
Shit, we're almost out of time.

34:56.530 --> 34:58.445
Look, if the whales
have the power

34:58.488 --> 35:01.578
to take away your Permanence,
this could be your last shot.

35:01.622 --> 35:04.755
No presh,
but you're our only hope.

35:07.758 --> 35:09.717
I will do my very best.

35:20.554 --> 35:22.512
Surely, you jest.

35:22.556 --> 35:24.601
I know, I know.

35:24.645 --> 35:27.299
It goes against everything
you've ever believed in,

35:27.343 --> 35:28.562
and I fully respect that,

35:28.605 --> 35:30.477
but the only way to fix this

35:30.520 --> 35:34.219
is to release the Kraken
right now.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.874
Well, I don't think
they liked that.

35:36.918 --> 35:38.310
- What?
- No.

35:38.354 --> 35:39.790
Damn it!

35:39.834 --> 35:41.749
Eliot?

35:41.792 --> 35:43.490
Please be careful.

35:43.533 --> 35:45.317
Uh, you don't know
what they will do.

35:45.361 --> 35:46.405
Hey!

35:48.364 --> 35:49.626
You know I'm right!

35:50.845 --> 35:53.500
I know you're listening.

35:53.543 --> 35:56.198
You know, I have it
on good authority

35:56.241 --> 35:59.375
that mating season
is in the fall.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.811
Do you never wanna fuck again?

36:00.855 --> 36:02.509
Eliot, that was too personal.

36:02.552 --> 36:03.814
Uh...

36:03.858 --> 36:05.816
okay, uh, sorry.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.950
Look, I get it.

36:08.993 --> 36:10.952
Look, I get it...
your ancestors made a deal,

36:10.995 --> 36:13.476
but special circumstances, okay?

36:13.520 --> 36:15.913
Just let it out for 30 seconds.

36:15.957 --> 36:18.916
I will fix this
and then, you know, uh,

36:18.960 --> 36:21.702
the Kraken will be back
in its safe little sea bed

36:21.745 --> 36:25.880
and, uh, you can maintain your
sigils for all of eternity.

36:25.923 --> 36:27.882
You gotta trust me.

36:27.925 --> 36:30.580
Just release the goddamn Kraken.

36:30.624 --> 36:33.888
Please, please, please,
please, please.

36:36.847 --> 36:37.847
Look.

37:00.958 --> 37:02.220
Hi there!

37:02.264 --> 37:04.745
Uh...

37:04.788 --> 37:06.616
are you the Kraken?

37:06.660 --> 37:08.792
No.

37:15.669 --> 37:17.235
Josh, Margo, Penny.

37:17.279 --> 37:18.889
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

37:18.933 --> 37:20.587
open the side door for Natasha.

37:20.630 --> 37:22.632
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

37:22.676 --> 37:24.416
Holy shit.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.375
Holy shit.

37:26.418 --> 37:27.942
Holy shit.

37:27.985 --> 37:31.598
This is before the moon broke.

37:31.641 --> 37:33.251
It worked.

37:33.295 --> 37:34.731
- Okay, break.
- Sorry.

37:38.779 --> 37:40.737
Um, could you just, uh...
could you...

37:40.781 --> 37:41.932
You're freaking out, aren't you?

37:41.956 --> 37:43.479
- No.
- Look, you can pull

37:43.522 --> 37:45.524
the ripcord now.
Get out, we'll handle this.

37:45.568 --> 37:47.526
Margo.

37:47.570 --> 37:50.442
Credenza.

37:50.486 --> 37:52.836
Don't ask questions,
just do what you say?

37:52.880 --> 37:54.751
Mm-hmm.

37:54.795 --> 37:56.666
Fine.

37:56.710 --> 37:58.537
Okay.

37:58.581 --> 38:00.496
Slight change of plans.

38:03.315 --> 38:05.361
We are so close
to saving everyone.

38:05.404 --> 38:06.425
You can't take that away
from us now.

38:06.449 --> 38:07.928
Look, whatever it is
you're after

38:07.972 --> 38:09.515
what's the point
if there's no world left?

38:09.539 --> 38:13.151
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

38:13.195 --> 38:14.544
Have you met people?

38:14.587 --> 38:17.808
I've met people, many people.

38:17.851 --> 38:19.636
How many people have you met?

38:19.679 --> 38:22.508
Because I bet
I've met more people.

38:22.552 --> 38:24.945
What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:24.989 --> 38:26.686
Hi.

38:26.730 --> 38:28.340
What the hell did...

38:30.299 --> 38:31.822
Hell, yes.

38:35.391 --> 38:36.914
What the... how did you...

38:36.957 --> 38:38.394
Julia, now.

39:02.983 --> 39:03.941
Hey!

39:03.984 --> 39:05.725
Hot pizza!

39:05.769 --> 39:07.988
That's one pizza
we definitely can enjoy.

39:08.032 --> 39:10.904
All right.
Oh, nice pour right there.

39:12.515 --> 39:14.865
Yes, cheers, cheers, yes.

39:14.908 --> 39:16.475
Bam!

39:16.519 --> 39:17.955
- All right, Emeril.
- Fresco pizza!

39:17.998 --> 39:20.436
Yes, cheers.

39:20.479 --> 39:21.524
Whoo!

39:29.749 --> 39:32.187
You don't want a drink?

39:34.406 --> 39:37.453
Actually, I desperately do not.

39:37.496 --> 39:38.908
- That's concerning.
- Those time loops

39:38.932 --> 39:40.934
must've really did
a number on you.

39:42.458 --> 39:43.720
So...

39:44.982 --> 39:48.464
You're right,
I have been pushing you away.

39:48.507 --> 39:51.293
Yeah, no shit.

39:51.336 --> 39:53.338
It's just...

39:58.778 --> 40:01.390
I do remember the Monster.

40:01.433 --> 40:05.742
It was bad and bloody and, um...

40:07.483 --> 40:09.789
Those memories are, like,
right here.

40:09.833 --> 40:12.531
And, um...

40:12.575 --> 40:14.664
you know, maybe I really do
need that drink.

40:14.707 --> 40:17.536
I don't get why you feel like
you have to go it alone.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.977
I don't either.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.979
My logical brain
knows without a doubt

40:26.023 --> 40:27.720
that I'm better with you.

40:27.764 --> 40:29.374
Yes, and same.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.469
Tell your coping mechanisms
to back off...

40:39.036 --> 40:41.256
Or I'll punch 'em in the dick.

40:41.299 --> 40:44.433
During the loops,
we were in it together

40:44.476 --> 40:47.044
and then you were gone, and...

40:47.087 --> 40:48.872
shocking revelation...

40:48.915 --> 40:50.676
I am utterly miserable
when you're not around.

40:50.700 --> 40:53.268
Yeah, I know.

40:53.311 --> 40:54.834
I don't know
if that's fair to you.

40:54.878 --> 40:57.837
What are you talking about?

40:57.881 --> 40:59.448
The other thing I learned

40:59.491 --> 41:02.451
being in the loops
with you for so long...

41:02.494 --> 41:05.454
you're not exactly
who you used to be.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.498
You've...

41:06.542 --> 41:07.891
Please don't say aged.

41:07.934 --> 41:11.938
You've evolved, Margo Hanson.

41:11.982 --> 41:13.636
You've become more
of your true self.

41:13.679 --> 41:15.725
You've earned it.

41:18.075 --> 41:20.991
And I don't want to ask you
to take a step back

41:21.034 --> 41:23.733
just so I can try and catch up.

41:23.776 --> 41:25.125
Oh.

41:25.169 --> 41:26.953
I was a mess you had
to untangle in there

41:26.997 --> 41:31.436
just so you could soldier on,
and... once you did,

41:31.480 --> 41:34.004
you figured out
how to fix all of this.

41:34.047 --> 41:35.155
And then you picked up the baton

41:35.179 --> 41:36.746
and actually did the thing.

41:36.789 --> 41:39.488
- I got lucky.
- No.

41:42.099 --> 41:47.060
It's 'cause you understand me
better than anyone.

41:47.104 --> 41:50.020
Mm-hmm.

41:50.063 --> 41:51.630
So quit acting
like you're the screw-up

41:51.674 --> 41:53.502
and get on my level, El.

41:56.853 --> 41:59.029
You did it.

41:59.072 --> 42:00.813
You did when the world
was on the line,

42:00.857 --> 42:02.728
now do it for yourself.

42:11.911 --> 42:13.913
I don't know
if I want to get on your level

42:13.957 --> 42:15.785
knowing that you
jacked off Todd.

42:15.828 --> 42:18.570
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.660
I did not.

42:27.144 --> 42:28.101
The hell?

42:28.145 --> 42:29.538
Coming.

42:31.061 --> 42:32.932
Oh, thank God!

42:32.976 --> 42:34.194
I've tried every other

42:34.238 --> 42:36.066
magical Penthouse
in the city and...

42:36.109 --> 42:38.721
- Todd.
- Wh... uh, what...

42:38.764 --> 42:40.200
Why are you here?

42:40.244 --> 42:42.072
I need your help.

42:42.115 --> 42:43.789
Something just happened that
feels way above my pay grade,

42:43.813 --> 42:45.138
and you were the first
person I thought of

42:45.162 --> 42:46.859
who could help me handle it.

42:46.903 --> 42:49.079
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

42:49.122 --> 42:53.039
So this pig dude
who kind of looks like

42:53.083 --> 42:54.867
that one guy
Paul Giamatti played

42:54.911 --> 42:56.565
in that one show
with all the wigs

42:56.608 --> 42:58.218
told me I'm supposed
to do a quest.

42:58.262 --> 42:59.916
Seriously?

42:59.959 --> 43:01.874
That asshole went to you?

43:01.918 --> 43:03.746
Wow. Ha.

43:03.789 --> 43:06.444
Yeah, he's extremely committed
to finding a dude.

43:06.488 --> 43:09.534
Yeah, it's fine, Todd.
We fixed it.

43:09.578 --> 43:12.668
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yes, I'm sure.

43:12.711 --> 43:14.887
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

43:14.931 --> 43:16.454
The who now?

43:16.498 --> 43:17.977
The end of the world?

43:18.021 --> 43:19.544
Uh, no.

43:19.588 --> 43:22.852
He did say the end of something
but not that.

43:22.895 --> 43:24.767
He was talking about Fillory.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.856
Remind me, is Fillory real?

43:28.901 --> 43:32.035
The end of Fillory?

43:32.078 --> 43:33.210
So...

43:33.253 --> 43:35.560
so we saved the wrong world?

43:39.651 --> 43:41.610
So we're not done.

43:44.569 --> 43:46.963
Of course.
