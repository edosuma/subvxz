00:58.720 --> 01:02.220
Bernie, seriously... this is where
they asked us to meet?

01:02.320 --> 01:03.380
Yeah. What do you mean?

01:03.480 --> 01:04.940
Oh, I think I see her.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.020
Where?

01:06.120 --> 01:07.804
Oh, that's gotta be her.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.380
So, what are we gonna do?

01:10.480 --> 01:11.540
Are we gonna grab a milkshake, Bernie?

01:11.640 --> 01:12.860
Is that why we're here?

01:12.960 --> 01:15.008
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.767
All right. You're gonna
owe me big for this.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.370
So...

01:32.400 --> 01:34.460
You think I should have worn
the other shirt?

01:34.560 --> 01:36.562
You look nice.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.300
I don't know, Gus. Maybe, she...

01:46.400 --> 01:48.050
What if she don't like
the look of me or something?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.089
Bernie. Come on.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.282
Are you serious? What about her?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.409
Aren't you dying to see
what she looks like?

01:55.520 --> 01:56.860
She could be a dog.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.180
No, she isn't a dog.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.660
She could be.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.180
I already know what
she looks like in my head.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.486
She ain't a dog.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.601
So, uh...

02:04.760 --> 02:08.321
You been talking to her for
weeks on the phone, right?

02:08.440 --> 02:09.660
- Yeah.
- Right?

02:09.759 --> 02:10.761
Yeah.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.860
She likes you from talking to you, Bernie.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.900
And I don't think you gotta worry
about her getting a good look at ya.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.446
That ain't never been your problem.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.565
Let's go.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.924
Come on.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.243
Should have worn the other shirt.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.220
I'm the one taking a risk.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.540
Doubling with some girl
I ain't never even spoke to...

02:49.640 --> 02:50.860
let alone seen!

02:50.960 --> 02:51.980
I don't know why this Miriam girl...

02:52.080 --> 02:54.367
says it's gotta be a double date, anyway.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.940
Maybe she's not sure about me yet.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.500
How can anybody
not be sure about you, Bernie?

02:59.600 --> 03:00.940
Yeah. Thanks, Gus.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.740
Yeah, hey, don't tell none of the guys
down at the station about this.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.922
It's not like you've
never been on a date before.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.251
- All set there?
- Uh...

03:12.360 --> 03:14.010
Excuse me.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.081
Are you Miriam?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.201
No.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.245
I'm her friend.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.041
She's, uh...

03:29.120 --> 03:31.327
Hi. How you doin'? I'm Gus.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.681
- Catherine.
- It's nice to meet you.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.006
Okay. We'll talk later.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.484
Bye.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.801
Hi.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.201
Wait.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.890
You are Bernie Webber, right?

04:10.080 --> 04:11.411
Uh, yeah.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.521
Yeah, I'm Bernie.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.409
Hey, you two, let's go grab a drink.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.646
Yeah.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.940
You wanna go?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.459
Sure.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.300
How you doin'? I'm Gus.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.006
You know, for a minute there...

04:27.160 --> 04:30.848
I thought it was Smokey the Bear
makin' a call in that booth.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.850
'Cause of your jacket.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.323
Oh.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.180
Bernie...

04:49.280 --> 04:52.780
Miriam's never been on a boat.
She's scared of the water.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.860
Has she never?

04:53.960 --> 04:56.460
I told her I don't know how she's
gonna date a guy in the Coast Guard.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.940
I'm not scared. I live on the Cape.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.580
Don't worry, Miriam. You know, we, uh...

05:01.680 --> 05:03.300
We all get scared out there.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.209
I'm not afraid of the water, Bernie.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.050
It scares me at night, that's all.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.601
You can't see what's underneath.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.001
Just more water.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.340
You know, I get funnier
as the night goes on.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.523
So, why, uh... Why didn't you
wanna meet me for a date?

05:30.520 --> 05:32.409
Why'd you... Why'd you wait so long?

05:34.120 --> 05:36.202
I didn't know if you'd be a...

05:37.320 --> 05:38.321
If I'd what?

05:41.240 --> 05:43.322
- You know.
- No.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.540
You're so handsome...

05:46.640 --> 05:48.961
I just didn't know
if you'd be attracted to me.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.580
Oh, God, no, Miriam.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.409
You're exactly how I pictured you.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.020
Yeah?

05:54.120 --> 05:55.610
Oh, yeah.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.401
Better.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.008
You know... My brother, uh...

06:03.160 --> 06:05.447
He always says that, "When
you know, you just know."

06:06.080 --> 06:07.060
Which one?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.083
Uh, all of it.
I guess, you know, everything.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.804
No. I mean, which brother?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.802
Oh. Ay...

06:14.320 --> 06:16.402
Uh, Paul. My brother, Paul.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.860
He's the one who fought
over in Germany, right?

06:17.960 --> 06:18.961
In Germany, yeah.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.700
He's the oldest. Father's favorite.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.245
All three of my brothers
went over to the war.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.361
He's your father's what?

06:27.040 --> 06:28.280
Hey.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.122
We should get Miriam
out on a boat tonight.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.730
What do you say, Bernie, hmm?

06:35.720 --> 06:36.767
We take out the dory.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.500
It'll be fantastic.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.700
You know we can't do that, Gus.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.020
We could get in trouble.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.167
Come on, Bernie. It'll be fun.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.486
Rules are rules.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.001
No. We don't gotta row out far.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.845
Just so this sweet girl can say
she's been on a boat, that's it.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.220
A rowboat? No.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.368
No.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.131
No, no. Small boats that...

06:59.520 --> 07:03.844
How about one of those bigger
boats? Tied up to the dock?

07:05.360 --> 07:06.691
If Bernie's with me, I'll do it.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.604
Oh, a fishing boat?

07:09.080 --> 07:13.260
Those fishermen don't want us around,
unless we're pullin' them in.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.580
They think they own the goddamn water.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.580
They're not very nice.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.140
Come on. Don't be such a fathead, Miriam.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.220
Yeah.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.722
Let's go out on the dory.
What's there to be afraid of?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.925
What's underneath, right?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.820
Hey there, Mr. Stello. How's it goin'?

07:43.920 --> 07:46.207
- Hey, Bernie.
- Mr. Ryder.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.690
Hey, so you see that girl
sitting over there?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.940
The one with the coat
looks like a bear, Bernie?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.340
- Yeah.
- Can't miss her.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.460
I said the same thing myself.
Funny you should say that.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.060
Looks like Smokey, right? Smokey the Bear.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.620
I don't know no Smokey, Bernie.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.245
Oh, it's just a cartoon.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.260
Anyway, Mr. Stello, she thinks
she's scared of going out on a boat.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.740
And I don't think
we should row out on a dory.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.764
I don't want her gettin' sick
on that nice, big coat.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.900
So, I was wondering if...

08:16.000 --> 08:18.446
So, you wanna take her on
the Anna G round the harbor?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.100
Yeah.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.580
Can't row out on that dory

08:21.680 --> 08:23.420
even if ya wanted, right, Bernie?

08:23.520 --> 08:25.921
- Carl, stop.
- Year anniversary's coming.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.049
My sister's now livin' in my house.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.460
How's it going with you, Bernie?

08:32.559 --> 08:35.484
That's enough, Carl. He did all he could.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.539
I am sorry, Mr. Nickerson.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.740
I didn't mean to upset you.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.565
Just wanted to ask Mr. Stello
about borrowing a boat.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.526
Got you. I got you.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.171
This is a boat.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.730
Give me your hands.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.891
It's okay.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.940
<i>Now the hacienda's dark</i>

09:30.040 --> 09:32.486
<i>The town is sleeping</i>

09:34.520 --> 09:37.460
<i>Now the time has come to part</i>

09:37.560 --> 09:40.530
<i>The time for weeping</i>

09:42.480 --> 09:47.725
<i>Vaya con dios, my darling</i>

09:48.480 --> 09:49.700
Just, uh...

09:49.800 --> 09:52.300
- Just follow my arms, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.164
Stay with me.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.260
- It's all about the rhythm.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.044
Okay? So it's, uh... So it's, uh...

09:59.640 --> 10:00.820
Here we go.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.900
One, two, three.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.420
Right, left, right.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.300
One, two, three.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.687
One, two, three. One...

10:08.840 --> 10:11.660
I can't one, two, three to this.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.060
- Let's just sit down, Bernie.
- No, sweetheart.

10:13.160 --> 10:17.060
Look, all you gotta do is you
gotta relax and be patient...

10:17.160 --> 10:19.100
and settle in my hand.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.020
Hey, look, just... Here...

10:21.120 --> 10:22.780
settle in my hand. You feel that?

10:22.880 --> 10:23.860
Mmm.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.940
Just listen to the music, right?

10:26.040 --> 10:29.726
And... One, two, three.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.860
One, two, three. Right, left, right.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.860
Right, left, right.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.121
You're doing great.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.011
<i>Now the dawn is breaking through</i>

10:44.120 --> 10:46.726
<i>A gray tomorrow</i>

10:48.000 --> 10:54.087
<i>But the memories we share
Are there to borrow</i>

10:56.080 --> 10:58.940
<i>Vaya con dios, my darling</i>

10:59.040 --> 11:00.405
Will you marry me?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.161
What?

11:08.320 --> 11:10.448
Will you marry me?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.445
Uh...

11:14.600 --> 11:15.761
No.

11:25.400 --> 11:30.884
<i>Vaya con dios, my darling</i>

11:32.720 --> 11:35.564
<i>Vaya con dios...</i>

11:35.680 --> 11:37.364
Miriam, hold on!

11:47.800 --> 11:48.860
It's cold, sweetheart.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.291
Don't you wanna go back inside?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.605
The band's not through.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.967
It's cold. Do you feel that?
There's a storm comin'.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.007
Okay.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.060
Okay, what?

12:16.160 --> 12:17.340
Okay, let's get married.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.340
I just... I don't wanna...

12:19.440 --> 12:20.646
Wanna what?

12:23.920 --> 12:26.900
Well, it's only been a few months
and it's still winter, after all.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.940
And, look, there's a storm comin'.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.940
It's just like this one
that come through last year.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.246
What does that...

12:34.360 --> 12:36.124
I heard it's gonna miss us.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.161
Yeah, but maybe not. You never know.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.290
You never know.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.082
Some people, they're
just not cut out for this.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.044
Sometimes you go out
and you don't come back.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.929
Are you talking about the storm
or marriage, Bernie?

12:53.320 --> 12:55.527
I think I'm talking about
the storm, right?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.689
You're scared of a storm?

12:59.200 --> 13:00.326
No.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.921
I don't want to disappoint nobody.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.207
And...

13:10.760 --> 13:13.286
I don't wanna lose you. I love you.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.767
So...

13:18.560 --> 13:20.642
Yeah, let's get married.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.881
You sure?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.365
Oh, yeah.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.140
When?

13:33.240 --> 13:35.340
You want me to pick a date? No!

13:35.440 --> 13:36.601
When do you wanna get married?

13:36.720 --> 13:38.340
April 16th.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.169
Okay.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.130
Okay. April 16th it is.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.084
But, uh, I gotta ask
permission from Cluff first.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.605
You gotta ask permission?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.300
Yeah, it's from my commanding officer.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.620
It's Coast Guard regulation.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.961
But I promise I'll ask him tomorrow.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.484
Okay, Bernie.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.045
Let's get you home.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.844
Man, you can dance.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.686
Ah, look at that. It's already
starting to snow. Hmm?

14:52.480 --> 14:54.528
Can you hear me
over this hummin', Captain?

14:56.120 --> 14:59.524
That fracture they welded last month
is not gonna hold in these seas, Cap.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.808
Takes a bad jolt,
she could fracture again.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.685
I don't have to go on deck, Cap.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.540
I can hear it from right down here.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.005
That weld is really hummin'.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.900
It's hummin', sir.
The weld is, uh... Hummin'.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.083
Uh, I'd like to take it down
to three knots, please.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.885
Uh...

15:21.480 --> 15:24.290
If we don't slow her down, Captain,
we might not have a, uh...

15:25.640 --> 15:26.766
A position to hold.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.646
Uh, no problem, Cap.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.321
Uh, holdin' at seven knots.
Thank you, sir.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.340
Hey, Pop?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.521
I hear it.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.300
You wanna go up on deck?

15:50.400 --> 15:53.060
Have a look at those crack arrestors
holdin' that weld together?

15:53.160 --> 15:56.340
Might as well go be get a hat, Popo.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.566
What did he say?

15:57.720 --> 16:01.260
Uh, he says he would like you to
consider taking a hat with you, as well.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.321
Get some sleep.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.860
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

16:19.960 --> 16:21.325
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

16:21.480 --> 16:22.811
Hey, Pops!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.340
What do you know about this weather?

16:24.440 --> 16:26.420
It's killin' me and young Eldon here.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.490
Tiny, sure it's the weather?
Maybe it's your singing.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.563
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

16:32.720 --> 16:34.420
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

16:34.520 --> 16:35.567
Come on.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.489
<i>The people all said sit down</i>

16:37.680 --> 16:38.806
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

16:39.400 --> 16:40.925
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.285
Ah, it's gonna get worse.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.086
Sybert!

17:05.240 --> 17:06.740
I didn't make it topside.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.523
That weld can't hold in these seas.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.250
You gotta slow her down.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.049
I'm calling the captain back.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.971
It's coming in!

17:52.720 --> 17:54.165
- You okay, Pops?
- Yeah.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.246
Go up!

18:11.160 --> 18:13.340
We've got a hull fracture
in the engine room!

18:13.440 --> 18:15.300
All hands muster mattresses...

18:15.400 --> 18:18.500
blankets, whatever you can
get your hands on!

18:28.640 --> 18:30.005
Tchuda.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.567
Yeah, boy?

18:33.080 --> 18:34.220
I can't get anyone on the bridge.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.420
I need you to go up and tell the captain
we got an 18-foot fracture in our hull.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.567
Tell him these pumps
are holding for now...

18:39.680 --> 18:41.020
but we don't put her into
port, we're gonna wreck.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.420
Captain don't understand me, Bouloo.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.564
I know he can't understand you
but he doesn't listen to anyone, anyway.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.531
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.241
- Cold out there?
- Yeah.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.180
You still tryin' to fix that darn thing?

20:24.280 --> 20:25.361
Yeah.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.409
Oh, come on. Fitzy, it's useless.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.380
Let the guy who fixes it come fix it.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.084
I would if he would show up.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.060
What's this on the radio,
ship breaking up?

20:34.160 --> 20:35.321
That's the Fort Mercer.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.940
Fort Mercer?

20:37.040 --> 20:39.260
She's a big lady. She's a T2 tanker.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.647
Started radioin' a couple hours ago.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.820
Apparently she's got
a big crack in her hull.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.740
It's spillin' oil all over the place.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.700
She's, uh, about 20 miles east
off of Nantucket.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.660
It sounds like Boston and Nantucket
are sendin' out their entire fleet, huh?

20:51.760 --> 20:53.000
We could be next.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.860
They're saying gale force winds
50 to 60 miles per hour.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.689
Yeah. Yeah.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.500
...waves at 50 feet. Over.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.620
It's gonna be a mess.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.211
Oh, uh, Bernie, Bernie.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.842
Uh, Miriam called for you.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.526
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.047
Good luck, pal.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.929
- Yeah.
- Mr. Cluff?

21:23.520 --> 21:25.249
It's me, Bernie, sir.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.060
Webber. Pick yourself a crew.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.690
Go out there, help them fishermen
secure their boats to the pier.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.406
Oh. Uh, yes, sir.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.322
Sir, I need to ask you a question.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.441
Uh...

21:39.200 --> 21:42.140
I need permission about a girl, you know?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.940
Permission? Permission... For a girl?

21:45.040 --> 21:46.420
Mr. Cluff, it's working.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.567
Yes, sir.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.841
Not now, Webber.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.300
But, sir. It's
not just "some girl," sir...

21:53.400 --> 21:54.765
Not now, Webber.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.660
We're back up.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.140
Cluster here's the Mercer rescue, right?

22:00.240 --> 22:03.060
And this here other pip,
two miles from here.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.288
We must still be gettin' phantom echoes.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.980
How we supposed to tell
where anything is out there?

22:08.080 --> 22:09.940
When's that technician
comin', Fitzpatrick?

22:10.040 --> 22:11.580
And where the hell's Chief Bangs?

22:11.680 --> 22:12.681
Uh...

22:13.280 --> 22:15.500
It's Fitzgerald, sir.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.046
Chief Bangs is in the mess hall, sir.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.765
You makin' fun of my accent
'cause I'm not from around here?

22:23.920 --> 22:25.888
No, Mr. Cluff.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.260
Why are you still standing here, Webber?

22:30.360 --> 22:31.340
Sir, but...

22:31.440 --> 22:33.283
Take Livesey here with you,
go tie up them fishin' boats.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.700
Yes, sir.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.802
You want me to go with Webber, sir?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.684
Secure fishing boats?

22:41.240 --> 22:44.130
You didn't hear me, Livesey?
Uh, yeah, you with Webber.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.641
Sorry, Richie. His orders, you know.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.325
That's enough time,
what do you think, huh?

23:15.880 --> 23:17.660
We're takin' on water, we
gotta launch them lifeboats.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.220
Why you gotta be such a jackass, Brown?

23:19.320 --> 23:22.620
Least we can do, pray for
the captain, Chief Collagen...

23:22.720 --> 23:24.980
Rest of them men. All good men.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.809
Hey, ain't we good men, Quirey?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.380
Ah, don't get me wrong.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.051
Prayin's great, but it ain't everything.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.850
We need to actually do somethin'.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.371
Sybert.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.126
A word.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.890
That hothead Brown, he wants
to launch the lifeboats.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.460
The lifeboats?

23:49.560 --> 23:50.700
Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.729
Now, between them, the two of them
are getting the men worked up.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.403
Now, I figure that you know
the boat better than anybody.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.620
You're practically married to it.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.620
So, I think they'll listen to ya.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.801
Listen to me?

24:09.200 --> 24:10.929
Pop, those men don't like me.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.128
Nobody on the ship likes me
but you and Tchuda.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.931
They might not like you, but
they'll know to listen to ya.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.569
We don't know if the captain
got off an S.O.S.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.682
Radio room's gone. We can't call nobody!

24:48.880 --> 24:51.340
It's just Garcia over there
with a little shortwave...

24:51.440 --> 24:52.601
tryin' to pick up chatter.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.888
I mean, as far as we know
nobody even knows we're out here.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.126
Now I'm saying we launch them lifeboats now
and we get off this ship while we can.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.402
How are you gonna get 'em down
in the water in this storm?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.762
It can't be done,
those boats are too small.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.251
It's suicide, Brown.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.740
You can't do this, you can't do that.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.140
What do you want us to do, Quirey?

25:09.240 --> 25:10.480
Just sit up here and do nothin'?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.980
That's it, no officers, no orders.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.300
Every man for himself.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.765
That ain't the way, Brown.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.369
That never did nothing for nobody.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.500
Now, the ship's split...

25:20.600 --> 25:23.620
at the bulkheads separating
tanks eight and nine.

25:23.720 --> 25:26.803
Mr. Sybert says that the other
tanks aren't fractured...

25:26.920 --> 25:28.570
So the air in the ballast
tanks should keep us afloat.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.620
But Mr. Sybert also says that...

25:30.720 --> 25:32.848
Mr. Sybert says this,
Mr. Sybert says that.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.340
He's a big boy.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.965
Let him say it himself. He's right here.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.407
Go ahead.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.460
Uh...

25:46.560 --> 25:48.100
We're sinking.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.248
Yeah, but the whistle works.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.980
So, we should keep blowing that.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.048
Maybe somebody'll hear it.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.060
I don't know,
but we're definitely sinking.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.721
The crack in the engine room
is takin' on too much water.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.220
Pumps can't keep up.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.100
If the water reaches the
air-intake in the engine...

26:11.200 --> 26:13.100
we're going to, uh, lose all the power.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.580
And if we lose all the power,
we lose the pumps.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.170
When we lose the pumps...

26:17.240 --> 26:18.810
She's gonna drop pretty quick.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.330
How long have we got before that happens?

26:23.920 --> 26:26.048
Four, maybe five hours.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.884
We need to buy ourselves some time.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.689
So somebody can find us.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.211
If anybody's even lookin'.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.601
Even if they do know we're here
those seas are big enough.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.762
I mean, it ripped this thing in half.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.684
How the hell are they gonna get out?

26:42.840 --> 26:45.730
That's why I'm sayin' we gotta
launch some lifeboats.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.500
Our luck's runnin' out.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.965
I don't believe in luck, Brown.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.500
Put those lifeboats out in those seas...

26:51.600 --> 26:53.060
they won't last 12 seconds.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.060
You and Quirey both,
you just wanna sit around and do nothin'.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.245
You got a better idea, Sybert,
or you just go back, hide down below?

27:07.440 --> 27:08.700
We're gonna run her aground.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.940
- Huh?
- Do what?

27:11.040 --> 27:13.202
You wanna run her aground, Sybert?

27:13.680 --> 27:15.887
Even if you could with
half a ship, why would you?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.900
She'd break apart,
dump us all out in that sea.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.180
It's our only choice.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.408
We're gonna find a soft shoal,
and we'll lay her up.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.766
We'll slow the water that's coming in.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.780
We'll stay in the same spot.
We'll blow the whistle.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.891
We'll give whoever's coming
to look for us a chance to find us.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.571
You're gonna steer a ship
without hydraulics?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.660
That's your plan? How's that gonna work?

27:34.760 --> 27:36.500
I'm gonna build a manual tiller.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.460
Hey, Sybert, why should
we even listen to you?

27:38.560 --> 27:40.340
The only thing you ever cared
about was this ship.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.420
Man, I'll tell you what.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.220
You two make a cute couple
at the bottom of the ocean.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.890
Me, I'm gonna get on a lifeboat.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.286
Look.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.449
We'll insert a steel beam
into the steering quadrant.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.401
We'll put pulleys
on the end of it for leverage.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.728
And we'll move her manually.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.121
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.130
I think I got the radio working.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.020
Bearing 83 degrees true...

28:15.120 --> 28:17.168
27 miles from Pollock Rip Light.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.288
About 20 miles east of Nantucket...

28:19.440 --> 28:22.020
"East of Nantucket"?
That ain't the Pendleton.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.220
Fort Mercer's emergency condition...

28:23.320 --> 28:24.820
Fort Mercer. That's another T2.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.447
Another tanker split in two besides us.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.206
But if everyone's gonna
help them, who's gonna...

28:32.360 --> 28:34.203
Who's gonna come for us?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.100
How you feelin'?

28:39.200 --> 28:40.486
- You all right?
- Mmm.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.700
Did you, uh, ask Cluff, yet?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.040
No.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.300
Why don't you ask him?

28:46.400 --> 28:47.900
- Webber!
- What's wrong with you?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.420
- Webber!
- What?

28:49.520 --> 28:52.000
You ask him yet? You ask Cluff?

28:54.360 --> 28:55.700
I told you not to tell nobody.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.723
I'm sorry, I'm not havin' a very good day.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.762
I know you're not feeling well...

28:58.880 --> 29:01.100
You know, Webber, you don't
need permission to get married.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.780
No, actually, you do, Chief.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.325
Unless you're underage.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.686
Thanks, Chief, just following regulations.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.700
Let's go get suited up.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.820
Uh, it's not regulation, Webber.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.161
It's just a formality, like a courtesy.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.847
And, hey, did I hear right,
that she asked you?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.460
Following orders, right, Webber?

29:20.560 --> 29:23.020
Yeah. Yeah, she asked me, Chief.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.565
Wow.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.340
Wow. You, uh, sure you got
your pants on, Webber...

29:27.440 --> 29:28.900
or is she wearin' 'em?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.809
Sounds like this girl cut off your...

29:33.040 --> 29:35.361
What, Webber? What? Huh?

29:35.480 --> 29:37.687
Don't you got boats to tie up?

29:38.800 --> 29:41.041
She's my fiancée, sir.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.924
Who asked you...

29:45.080 --> 29:46.380
to be married.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.020
Come on, Richie, let's go.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.770
One moment.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.361
Uh-huh, sure.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.928
I'm sorry, sir. Please speak up.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.180
This line is bad, ma'am.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.406
I'll try and reconnect it to you.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.683
Please, sir. The lines are down.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.207
Bernie? How are you? How's work?

30:03.320 --> 30:05.163
Yeah, it's been one
of those days, you know.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.281
But how are you?

30:06.440 --> 30:08.420
Hey, you're not the radar
technician, are you?

30:08.520 --> 30:09.860
Uh, no.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.220
I was ordered to hole up here
till the storm passes.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.561
Catch a ride back out to my lightship.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.001
Um, you can go wait in
the mess hall, if you want to.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.925
Now is not a good time, you know.

30:20.080 --> 30:23.580
Um, I gotta get ready to go
down to the pier, tie up some boats. So...

30:23.680 --> 30:24.860
I wish you were here with me.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.420
I'm hearin' all sorts of things
about a ship breakin' up, and I...

30:27.520 --> 30:28.567
- Oh.
- Hello?

30:29.040 --> 30:30.087
What, you okay?

30:30.400 --> 30:33.563
Yeah, we just lost our lights.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.060
You better go find 'em, then.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.700
Nantucket's dispatched
their 36-footer to the Mercer.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.020
We got orders to do the same.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.980
You asked Cluff yet? That's him, right?

30:42.080 --> 30:43.923
Not yet, sweet... Uh...

30:44.960 --> 30:46.060
I'll explain later.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.660
- I... I gotta go.
- Okay.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.841
I love you.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.200
I love you, too.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.805
Yeah, bye.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.260
The best part of it is
she had no idea who I was.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.361
Bangs?

31:01.400 --> 31:04.644
Pick yourself a crew
take the 36500 out of Old Harbor.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.500
Proceed to the Fort Mercer...

31:06.600 --> 31:09.100
20 miles east of here
off Nantucket, you hear?

31:09.200 --> 31:13.009
Uh, whoa, I don't believe we'd get
over the bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.805
We're better off takin'
the 36383 out of Stage Harbor.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.125
That would take longer, right?

31:18.680 --> 31:19.886
Not much.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.820
What do you think, Webber?

31:24.920 --> 31:26.020
You're a bosun mate, too.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.485
You know what it's like out there.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.020
Yeah, look. No one's gettin' over
the bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.121
Nobody.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.486
It's a suicide mission.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.763
We should take the 36383
out of Stage Harbor.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.140
It'll take longer, sure.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.322
At least we'll be able to get out.

31:47.840 --> 31:50.100
Godspeed, Chief.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.780
Webber, take Gouthro and
Livesey down to the fish pier.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.006
Yes, sir.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.100
Don't get me sick, Gus.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.645
You shouldn't even be out here.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.820
Why you always raggin' on us, Richie?

33:13.920 --> 33:16.180
Don't take it out on us
'cause you couldn't go out with Bangs.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.300
At least he'll get out.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.140
Screw you. That were a year ago.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.446
Screw you.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.085
No one could have
got over the bar that day.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.660
Bangs coulda.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.700
Oh, really, Richie.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.962
He's not trying to get
across the bar today.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.660
No, he's taking the 36383...

33:28.760 --> 33:31.140
right out from the nice,
protected bay side.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.765
Ah.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.410
Bernie, it doesn't matter
what Richie here thinks...

33:40.160 --> 33:43.528
or Bangs or Carl Nickerson or nobody.

33:44.280 --> 33:47.329
Nobody could have got out
to save the men on the Landry

33:48.120 --> 33:49.770
Sometimes, you know...

33:50.720 --> 33:52.563
Sometimes men die, Bernie.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.286
All right. Here we go.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.139
All right, hang on.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.650
Easy, now. Easy, fellas.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.047
- I got it.
- Okay, up, up, up!

34:37.719 --> 34:38.739
One...

34:38.840 --> 34:39.841
Two.

34:41.639 --> 34:42.641
All together now.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.360
Three!

34:52.159 --> 34:53.400
Tie it down, boys. I got it.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.300
All right. Now we've got a tiller.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.243
We're gonna drive her up on the shoal.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.340
Uh-uh. Brown and them others, they're
getting ready to launch them lifeboats.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.488
They think it's their best hope.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.806
Oh, Pop.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.500
We need every guy we got.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.251
Well, they're gonna take them lifeboats.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.780
What are you tryin' to do, Sybert?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.041
Get off him!

35:45.960 --> 35:47.610
You come up here tryin' to kill us?

35:47.720 --> 35:49.180
Are you trying to kill us?

35:49.280 --> 35:50.460
Back off him.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.900
Get up!

35:52.000 --> 35:53.340
You're out of your mind!

35:53.440 --> 35:55.100
Brown, he just saved your life, okay?

35:55.200 --> 35:57.441
The boat's in pieces. It's gone!

35:57.600 --> 35:58.840
Enough!

36:03.320 --> 36:05.800
That boat is too small for these seas.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.500
And this ship will be sunk by nightfall.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.931
Now, every fella here wants to live...

36:12.080 --> 36:16.130
and the only way that happens
is if we run her aground!

36:18.920 --> 36:22.420
We gotta set up a watch
and look out for a shoal.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.380
I need four men working the pulleys
on the emergency tiller.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.340
I need four men manning
the pumps, aft to steering...

36:28.440 --> 36:31.331
and the rest of you run a bucket line
topside down below...

36:31.440 --> 36:33.488
...communicate with the engine room.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.244
And somebody...

36:37.960 --> 36:40.020
keep blowing that whistle.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.930
You heard him, boys! Now move it! Come on!

36:47.760 --> 36:50.081
Sounds like you're the man now, Sybert.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.490
I hope you didn't just kill us all.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.325
I saw a ship driftin'.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.040
Heard it whistle.

37:17.160 --> 37:20.140
A distress signal. 45 minutes ago, Bernie.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.765
From my house.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.441
Uh...

37:24.040 --> 37:27.044
With the wind blowin' south,
and those currents...

37:28.000 --> 37:31.285
I guess that'd put her close to here
about now comin' up over the bar.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.002
Can't be part of the Mercer, Bernie.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.820
She's off Nantucket,
40 miles southeast of here.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.287
Means she would have
drifted northwest then, right?

37:38.400 --> 37:39.970
I know what I heard.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.005
Know what I saw.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.771
Well, okay, then, uh...

37:49.440 --> 37:53.491
How about we go back to the station
see if we can get to the bottom of it?

37:54.560 --> 37:56.449
Just got off the phone with Boston.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.580
They diverted a plane from the Mercer...

37:58.680 --> 38:00.523
and it sighted the stern
of the tanker Pendleton...

38:00.640 --> 38:02.529
five miles east of here.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.540
Oh, my God.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.460
Two tankers broken in half in one day.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.891
That's gotta be some kind of record.

38:08.440 --> 38:11.780
Boston and Nantucket have dispatched
all their boats to the Mercer.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.008
They can't make it here in this weather.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.006
Webber.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.380
Pick yourself a crew.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.131
Take that 36500 out
and you go over the bar...

38:44.240 --> 38:47.210
and you find the stern of
the Pendleton. You hear?

38:49.760 --> 38:51.762
Uh... Yes, sir.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.900
Um...

39:03.000 --> 39:06.044
You fellas want to get warmed up,
get some coffee?

39:07.080 --> 39:08.127
Bernie.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.681
Yeah.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.420
Uh...

39:11.520 --> 39:12.646
What?

39:14.440 --> 39:16.044
What Carl's trying to say...

39:16.600 --> 39:17.761
This isn't about the Landry

39:17.880 --> 39:19.769
Oh, sure it is.

39:19.880 --> 39:20.900
Richie.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.968
Eight men died that night.

39:23.120 --> 39:26.488
You and Gus and Masachi
couldn't even get out.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.727
What makes you think you can do it now?

39:32.320 --> 39:34.322
You know the bar on this
kind of day, right, Bernie?

39:34.440 --> 39:35.441
Yeah.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.580
That man in there
don't know what he's doin'.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.886
He's sending you out to die.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.380
You can't make it over Chatham
bar on a day like this.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.404
Can't stay afloat for long
on half a ship neither.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.689
Mr. Stello, in the Coast Guard
they say, you gotta go out.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.609
But they don't say you gotta come back in.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.220
That's regulation, you know.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.443
Bernie, better you get lost
afore you get too far out, then.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.608
Oh, don't worry about me, Mr. Ryder.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.940
I can't get lost out there.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.690
I know those waters pretty good.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.140
How could I get lost?

40:08.240 --> 40:10.540
No, no, no, no, Bernie.
What Dave's trying to say...

40:10.640 --> 40:14.888
you should just motor around the harbor
say you tried to get out and couldn't.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.521
You know?

40:21.320 --> 40:23.607
Thank you, Mr. Ryder. Thank you.

40:24.040 --> 40:27.601
But, Mr. Stello, I'm gonna do
my best to get out there.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.161
I don't know if I will, but I'm gonna try.

41:00.760 --> 41:01.807
Okay.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.881
I guess Richie's in.

41:04.720 --> 41:05.881
Who else?

41:09.040 --> 41:11.042
Uh, I don't know, Gus.
You can hardly lift your head.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.620
Who else you gonna take, Bernie?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.820
Fitz is the only other engineman left.

41:14.920 --> 41:18.603
And he's only third class
and he don't got the experience.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.127
I'll... I'll go.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.403
Yeah, I can do the job.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.220
I mean, I can do it. You can't go.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.560
You're sick as a dog, Gus.

41:31.480 --> 41:32.766
He's right, Gus.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.845
One more.

41:43.320 --> 41:45.926
Someone has to go out there
and save those guys, right?

41:46.800 --> 41:50.009
That's why I signed up.
Guess now's my chance.

41:51.760 --> 41:55.526
Seaman Ervin Maske, Stonehorse lightship.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.045
Pumps aren't keepin' up.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.366
Three more feet...

43:18.440 --> 43:19.660
till we lose the engines.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.683
Can you lock that boiler on full?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.660
You crazy to think
you can steer her broken...

43:23.760 --> 43:25.842
with a couple of ropes
and a hand-made tiller, boy.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.247
You got a better idea? I'm all ears.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.683
There! A shoal about a mile distance!

43:35.800 --> 43:37.100
We can make that!

43:37.200 --> 43:39.020
Rudder, 15 degrees to port!

43:39.120 --> 43:41.088
Half-speed if we want to hit it head on!

43:41.240 --> 43:44.289
Gotta make a turn 80 degrees
on the compass to 310!

43:47.400 --> 43:50.780
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

43:50.880 --> 43:53.565
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

43:53.720 --> 43:57.202
15 degrees port! Half-speed!
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

43:57.400 --> 43:59.340
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

43:59.440 --> 44:01.090
80 degrees to 310 on the compass!

44:01.240 --> 44:02.180
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

44:02.280 --> 44:03.441
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

44:03.640 --> 44:05.500
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

44:05.600 --> 44:07.329
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

44:07.960 --> 44:10.060
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

44:10.160 --> 44:11.571
80 degrees to 310 on the compass!

44:11.880 --> 44:14.500
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

44:14.600 --> 44:16.921
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

44:26.160 --> 44:27.969
Rudder, 15 degrees port. Half-speed.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.650
80 degrees to 310 on compass.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.364
Thank you, Eldon.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.287
All right! You guys! Now, pull!

44:45.400 --> 44:48.244
Pull, pull, pull! Come on!

45:15.120 --> 45:18.245
Please tell me we're takin' that boat
to a bigger boat.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.620
You ever been on a rescue mission before?

45:19.720 --> 45:20.700
No.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.529
Mostly I just chip paint.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.482
Sometimes I cook for the boys.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.500
Great.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.540
All right, you, uh, take the glory hole.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.369
Maske. Ervin Maske.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.540
Ervin, yeah.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.849
Uh, Richie, drop
the mooring line when you can.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.762
Last known position
of the Pendleton is here.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.900
So, I figure once we cross the bar...

45:50.000 --> 45:53.260
I reckon with the currents
she'll have drifted about here.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.885
That's six miles from us.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.620
So, you think Bernie can get
us out past the bar in this?

46:06.720 --> 46:09.007
I've never seen anything like it.

46:09.120 --> 46:13.042
Yeah, I mean, he's just gotta be sure
that he doesn't pitchpole us, that's all.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.361
Huh?

46:14.840 --> 46:17.841
The power of the waves on that bar
they can pick you up...

46:17.960 --> 46:21.020
they can turn you end for end
over and over again.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.406
There's no way to survive that.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.045
That's pitchpoling.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.780
Hey, Fitz, are we good?

46:43.880 --> 46:45.700
All right, give it a shot!

46:52.680 --> 46:53.966
Free the lines!

46:54.560 --> 46:55.721
Lines freed!

47:35.720 --> 47:37.609
Did Bernie go out, Gus?

47:37.720 --> 47:39.449
Miriam, what are you doing here?

47:40.720 --> 47:41.801
Did he?

47:43.120 --> 47:44.326
Yeah, Cluff sent him.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.566
I wanna talk to him.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.049
- Who?
- Cluff.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.884
Your commanding officer. Where is he?

47:52.840 --> 47:54.100
I wanna find out where Bernie is.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.804
I'm worried about him.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.166
We're supposed to get married.

47:57.320 --> 47:59.846
Miriam, this isn't what
any of the other girls do.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.245
Or wives.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.684
They don't come in here,
and they don't do this.

48:08.560 --> 48:09.607
So?

48:15.440 --> 48:18.444
If you want, I guess you can wait in here.

48:18.840 --> 48:20.604
Listen to what's going on.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.761
Sit down.

49:10.520 --> 49:13.922
Tide's risin'.
Gonna work us off that shoal.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.241
We need to hit it hard.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.970
Yeah, there's no other way.

49:17.720 --> 49:18.767
Wave!

49:39.960 --> 49:42.531
You feel that? She's drifting.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.321
Must have lost the tiller.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.603
We gotta slow her headway
or we're gonna miss that shoal for good.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.020
Close the governor valves,
cut the propulsion.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.220
We gotta isolate the boiler.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.766
We gotta conserve everything
she's got left!

49:56.880 --> 50:00.900
I keep tellin' you, Bouloo.
This boat just bad luck.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.085
It's got nothing... to do... with luck.

50:37.520 --> 50:40.808
Station Chatham, this is the CG-36500.

50:40.960 --> 50:42.166
Do you copy?

50:42.320 --> 50:43.340
This is Station Chatham.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.807
36500, what is your location? Over.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.740
Station Chatham, we, uh...

50:48.840 --> 50:50.251
We are now passing Morris Island.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.406
Heading down the channel
towards Chatham bar. Over.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.860
What's it mean, going over that bar?

50:56.960 --> 50:58.121
Miriam, don't do this to yourself.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.571
Why not?

51:00.760 --> 51:02.125
Why not, Gus?

51:03.520 --> 51:05.284
If I'm gonna be with him, I wanna know.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.411
You're the girl with the bear coat, right?

51:10.800 --> 51:11.881
Yeah.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.605
Yeah, that's me.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.002
You gonna tell me
what it's like out there?

51:24.040 --> 51:27.522
Shoals on that bar are never
in the same place twice.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.204
Flood currents carryin' them
big ocean swells...

51:31.400 --> 51:34.730
that rise up when they hit the shallows,
crash up against that bar.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.130
Outgoing tide crashes up against that bar.

51:38.760 --> 51:39.841
That, uh...

51:41.240 --> 51:44.771
That man shouldn't have sent them out
to cross that bar in a storm like this.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.050
Maybe they can turn back.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.500
Maybe they get lost before.

51:51.600 --> 51:52.886
Can't get out.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.404
You know Bernie, right?

52:00.040 --> 52:02.202
You know he won't get lost out there.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.891
You know he follows the rules.

52:06.400 --> 52:08.528
Yeah, we know.

52:09.960 --> 52:11.724
We all going down to the pier soon.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.605
See if there's anything
we can do down there.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.570
Welcome to come.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.884
Miriam. Miriam!

52:31.360 --> 52:33.060
Miriam, please come here.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.161
Miriam!

52:37.480 --> 52:39.380
Excuse me, are you Commander Cluff?

52:39.480 --> 52:40.481
Who are you?

52:40.600 --> 52:42.500
I'm Miriam Penttinen,
Bernie Webber's girlfriend.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.020
I want you to call Bernie back in.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.260
That girl he was asking me about.

52:45.360 --> 52:46.600
You know what he was gonna ask me?

52:47.600 --> 52:49.300
For your permission to marry me.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.369
Well, that's between you,
him and your God.

52:52.480 --> 52:54.847
Asking me is just a formality.
He can marry you all he wants.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.121
Don't he know that?

52:57.440 --> 52:59.340
But you can't be in here, miss.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.420
It's Bernie.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.602
Chatham bar dead ahead. Over.

53:02.720 --> 53:04.131
36500, Station Chatham.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.011
Proceed as directed
towards Pendleton stern.

53:08.320 --> 53:10.020
I didn't copy that, Station Chatham.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.406
Conditions hazardous.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.660
Why give us permission if
you're sending him out to die?

53:14.760 --> 53:16.330
What the hell?

53:17.120 --> 53:19.980
Gouthro, get her out of here.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.860
Sir, winds have gone from 40 to 60...

53:22.960 --> 53:24.803
since the call first come in.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.860
That's gonna be
hurricane strength in an hour.

53:26.960 --> 53:28.485
Gouthro, he's got his orders.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.060
You get her out of here,
and you get yourself to bed.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.764
You're too sick to be in here.

53:42.200 --> 53:45.522
36500, Station Chatham,
proceed over the bar.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.802
I repeat, proceed.

53:48.440 --> 53:49.965
Once over, travel directly south.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.580
The radar's intermittent...

53:51.680 --> 53:54.060
but it's showing a pip 10 or 12 miles...

53:54.160 --> 53:58.085
...east of Monomoy Point,
moving south. Over.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.727
Station Chatham, this is the 500.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.570
Copy that.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.970
I hear what everyone's saying.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.969
You don't know what you're doing.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.527
Excuse me?

54:25.240 --> 54:28.403
Maybe... Maybe it's because
you're not from here.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.820
You don't know what it's like out there...

54:29.920 --> 54:32.650
What the hell would you know
what it's like out there, miss?

54:32.960 --> 54:33.961
Hmm?

54:34.720 --> 54:36.420
Please, just call them back.

54:36.520 --> 54:39.809
What do you think it's gonna be like
being married to a Coast Guard man?

54:39.920 --> 54:41.445
Please, just call them back.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.580
You gonna come in here scared
every time he out in the water?

54:44.680 --> 54:46.060
Please call them back.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.969
You don't belong here.

54:48.800 --> 54:50.529
Please call them back.

54:51.720 --> 54:54.220
Get out of here! Get out of my station!

54:54.320 --> 54:56.060
And go home to where you belong, miss!

54:56.160 --> 54:57.180
Please call them back.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.442
Get out of my station!

56:00.480 --> 56:02.289
Shoal's getting behind us.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.980
Only chance now is a harder turn...

56:06.080 --> 56:07.127
if the chains hold.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.411
But it could capsize us.

56:28.440 --> 56:29.646
That's good, boy.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.768
You need to stand clear, boys!

56:46.880 --> 56:49.420
If those shackles crack
and these chains snap...

56:49.520 --> 56:51.010
it'll rip right through ya!

56:52.000 --> 56:53.047
Here we go.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.483
- Got her moving!
- Yeah!

57:14.440 --> 57:16.204
Hear that?

57:17.960 --> 57:20.281
That's it, that's the bar.

57:25.480 --> 57:27.608
Couple minutes now, boys.

57:34.960 --> 57:39.090
<i>When I was a little boy</i>

57:41.280 --> 57:45.171
<i>So my mother told me</i>

57:45.320 --> 57:48.608
<i>To me! Way, haul away</i>

57:48.760 --> 57:50.046
Haul away

57:51.480 --> 57:55.280
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

57:55.720 --> 57:59.122
<i>Now, first I met a Yankee girl</i>

57:59.600 --> 58:03.321
<i>She was fat and lazy To me!</i>

58:03.440 --> 58:06.603
<i>Way haul away</i>

58:06.760 --> 58:10.128
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

58:10.880 --> 58:13.780
<i>And then I met an Irish girl</i>

58:13.880 --> 58:17.248
<i>She damn near drove me crazy To me!</i>

58:18.320 --> 58:21.608
<i>Way haul away</i>

58:21.720 --> 58:25.042
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

58:25.640 --> 58:28.450
<i>Now way, haul away</i>

58:28.560 --> 58:31.660
<i>We're bound for better weather</i>

58:31.760 --> 58:32.740
<i>To me!</i>

58:32.840 --> 58:35.605
<i>Way haul away</i>

58:35.720 --> 58:38.620
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

59:01.240 --> 59:02.401
Hey, hey, boys!

59:03.600 --> 59:06.060
We're not gonna be able
to see much, all right?

59:06.160 --> 59:08.640
So we'll have to listen to
those waves hittin' that bar.

59:09.840 --> 59:11.171
Gotta time it.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.045
So I'm gonna wait for a lull...

59:14.320 --> 59:15.700
and then we go.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.131
We got faith in you, Skip!

59:17.560 --> 59:18.700
Anytime you're ready...

59:18.800 --> 59:20.860
you just go, Bernie, all right?

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.204
The compass is gone!

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.729
Fitzy! The engine died!

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.806
Ahh!

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.282
- I got it, I got it!
- No, you don't.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.420
You got about five seconds, boys!

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.601
It's gravity-fed, it doesn't know
which way is up and down.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.801
I know!

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.005
Come on, fire it up!

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.121
Yeah!

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.208
Maske! Get back here!

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.371
Tide's risin'.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.805
It'll get us through.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.762
But let me know what's comin'.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.801
Hey, Fitz! We made it over the bar.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.445
Back to the spotlight!

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.641
Coming out!

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.767
We turned too late!

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.362
We gotta buy that time back.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.603
Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees
in the next two minutes...

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.165
or we'll miss that shoal!

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.740
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes!

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.285
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:11.162
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes!

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.171
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.291
We're putting her in reverse.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.283
We're gonna let the ocean push us.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.721
Hold on.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.841
Okay.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.685
Whoa!

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.562
You may wanna brace yourself, Eldon.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.125
318!

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.608
316!

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.084
Close her down as soon as she hits!

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.610
312!

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.491
Gentlemen, brace yourselves.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.326
Hold on!

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.300
Now!

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560
Well...

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.401
You did it.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.571
It bloody well worked, Mr. Sybert.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.340
We gotta keep the water away
from the air inlets for the engine.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:37.841
If we lose power, we'll lose our pumps.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.700
And I'm afraid we're taking on
so much water...

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.643
the weight will pull us
right back off the shoal.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.805
Feels funny not to be
moving around, huh, Eldon?

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.406
All right.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.451
Let's get to it.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.340
We're heading down to the lodge.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:24.487
- Everything okay?
- Stop it!

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.100
- Hi!
- Quiet down now.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.340
My God, give me a break.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.899
Uh, I was on my way home.
My car spun out into a ditch.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.444
I need some help.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.645
Yeah, all right. We live near here.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.450
We can go back to my house.
I'll call my brother.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.720
He can tow you out. Jump in.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.220
Thank you.

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:43.321
You don't got a coat?

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.620
You can move that.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.140
We're bringing it down to St. Martin's
in case there are any survivors.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.241
Oh, uh...

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.767
I left my coat at the Coast Guard station.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.220
You got a man there?

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.481
Stop it!

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.481
Uh, I...

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.603
He's not there right now. It's, um...

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.601
It's Bernie Webber.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.686
Yeah. Bernie, he's a good man.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.325
We can't find them without
a compass, Bernie!

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.802
We got no idea where they are!

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.246
Hold on!

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.604
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.420
You okay?

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.524
I'm having a great time now, Bernie!

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.841
Lot of fun!

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.082
- Brace yourselves!
- Oh...

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.685
Whole lotta... Whole lot of fun here.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.420
Here. Come on, take it. Use it.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.601
Got it, Pop!

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.660
We lost the pumps.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.620
The pumps are tripping the breakers.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.245
I'll go check the connection.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.926
Give me the light.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.282
It's not worth a damn, Bouloo.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.801
Sometimes, I wish I didn't understand you.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.804
Sybert, what's going on?

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.808
We're using every pump we've got.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.081
We jammed the breakers so
the pumps wouldn't trip them.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.969
We've got about two feet till the water...

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.961
hits those air inlets to the engines
and then the ship's dead.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.246
Jesus Christ.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.020
You hear that?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.980
That's the tide rising,
gonna work us off this shoal.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.084
Look, look, this'll at least
give us some time.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.965
Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.645
That right. Sure does, boy.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.570
Yeah, long as we got the generators
keeping the pumps going.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.287
Buy whoever might be coming
to find us a little bit of time.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.500
You wanted to be the man, Sybert.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.601
Now you're the man, right?

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.920
Except you got no wife,
you got no kids back home.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.364
You're a single man.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.740
Always hiding down below.
What you got to lose?

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.921
All right, that's enough, Brown.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.843
I'm scared, too, Brown.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.963
I got a life, the same as you.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.601
Just don't see the point
in sitting around talking about it.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.527
Station Chatham, 36500.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.802
Station Chatham, 36500.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:23.940
Do you copy?

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.166
Station Chatham, this is Chief Bangs...

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.180
CG-36383.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.127
Pollock lightship, CG-36500, do you copy?

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.260
Why can't they hear us, Bernie?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.566
We can hear them!

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.940
Seas are too high, zero headway,

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.804
Station Chatham, do you copy?

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.729
Repeat, we're coming home.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.168
Station Chatham to 36383,

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.725
return to Old Harbor.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.049
Pollock lightship, CG-36500, do you copy?

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.580
- We're all alone.
- Bangs, return to Old Harbor.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.011
You heard Bangs on the radio.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.380
It sounds like he couldn't get out.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.006
Going back in, the storm is getting worse.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.241
We should turn back in, Webber.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.850
Look, Bernie, we already made it out...

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.128
further than anybody thought was possible.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.420
Maybe Richie's right.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.620
Maybe we should just go back.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.041
Winds at force of eight to nine.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.100
Repeat: Winds at force of eight to nine.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.247
Heavy snow squalls.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.885
You heard Bangs on the radio!

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.180
We got no compass!

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.123
We have no way to communicate!

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.180
You're...

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.602
What? What? I'm what, Richie?

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.411
I got us out this far, didn't I?

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.767
Not Bangs or Cluff, or nobody else.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.927
I did it!

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.045
We did it, Richie.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.490
You wanna turn back around?

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.767
No.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.725
No, not now. We came too far.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.410
We're not giving up on them.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.923
Not on my watch.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.765
Just do your job.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.087
Hey, Fitz!

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.929
Turn off the beam, Fitz.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.280
We'll run her dark.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.765
Better shot at seeing light
from the Pendleton if we're running dark.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.940
Watch it!

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.971
Get back here!

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.340
Fitz!

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.487
Get your butts back here!

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.682
I lost my hat!

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.481
Whoa...

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.646
Are you okay?

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.642
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.844
I'm just tired.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.331
Come on.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.162
You kids go on and play in the bedroom.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.322
You can wait with them, miss,
while I call my brother.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.686
Thanks.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.569
Please call me Miriam.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.969
You think your mother would
mind if I turned on the radio?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.089
Coast Guard Boston, this is the Unimak.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.165
We're at the Mercer bow now,
here in support of the Yakutat.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.041
Four Mercer crewmen jumped
from the deck. All were lost.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.009
Repeat, four men lost.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.686
Several crew members have hypothermia.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.891
We're going to wait until daybreak
to attempt another rescue. Over.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.081
Does no good listening
to all that chatter, Miriam.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.210
Better learning to live not knowing.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.691
How long you been married to Bernie for?

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.361
We're...

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.082
We're not married yet.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.340
I don't know if I can...

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.602
Like I said, Bernie, he's a good man.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.321
Him and some of them others
tried getting out a year ago...

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.283
to save my husband Arne
and the crew of the Landry

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.649
They were out fishing Monomoy
near Nantucket Sound...

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.086
when the boat started taking on water.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.969
A night just like this.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.961
Come on.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.926
We gotta get going.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.180
My brother's on his way to come meet us.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.300
- Thanks.
- I gotta get down the lodge.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.606
Come on, you two.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.300
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.368
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.326
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.528
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.490
<i>And the devil may pull you under</i>

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.325
<i>By the sharp lapels
Of your checkered coat</i>

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.525
<i>Sit down, sit down, sit down</i>

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.327
You know who she is?

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.200
Ain't Bernie's fault, Carl.
Ain't nobody's fault.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.620
Be like her blaming you.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.211
For what?

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.580
You're the one that told them
there's another ship out there.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.569
They're out there because of you, right?

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.641
Fitz.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.645
Turn on the search light.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.721
I can't believe we found her.
Look at that.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.211
We're too late.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.044
She's a ghost ship.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.085
- Are you seeing this, sir?
- Yeah.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.362
- You see that guy?
- Yeah, yeah, I see him.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.004
Not sure I believe it.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.368
Where the hell's he going?

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.404
Good to see ya, boys!

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.060
How we gonna fit them all on this boat?

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.606
We're only built to hold 12, includin' us.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.322
That's just regulation, though, right?

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.890
How many can she fit?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.925
20, 22, tops.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.820
Wait!

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.604
They're coming down here.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.849
- Drop the stanchion!
- Port side!

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.641
Come on!

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.003
Come on! I got ya!

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:51.721
We got ya!

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.085
Maske, get over here!

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.686
Come on!

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.171
Grab him!

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.208
You know where you're going now, miss?

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.645
I think so.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.100
Thanks for your help, Mr. Nickerson.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.201
Yeah.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.281
You know...

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.380
Bernie ain't out there because of me.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.527
Yeah, I know.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.481
It's Bernie's job to go out, right?

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.803
How can I blame you for it?

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.924
Nice and slow. Nice and slow.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.286
You'll be all right.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.580
Pete, you're next.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.603
Take it nice and slow. Easy, easy.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.761
Come on!

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.168
You gotta go, we're leaving nobody behind!

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.340
Eldon, get on the ladder!

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.601
Come on, we gotta get them down!

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.008
She's slipping!
We gotta get off this ship!

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.121
Hurry!

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.369
Eldon? How you doing?

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.329
I'm scared.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.521
Well...

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.202
Gonna be a lot scarier up here without us.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.283
You gotta listen to me!

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.966
Eldon.

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.646
You just follow right behind me.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.167
If I can do it, anyone can.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.161
Come on!

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.162
Tiny!

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.011
Tiny! Tiny, hold on!

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.321
Hey!

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.820
Eldon.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.081
Eldon!

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.930
Eldon, look at me!

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.246
Look at me!

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.220
When I say jump, let go.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.321
You ready?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.460
Jump!

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.601
You okay?

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.807
We're riding so heavy,
you can hardly steer.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.282
Sir, they're saying there's still
seven or eight up there on board.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.804
Maybe we take these guys back in...

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.121
and come back out.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.130
We can't leave them out here alone.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.404
That boat won't last.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.848
We all live, or we all die.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.521
Right?

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.000
You, uh...

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.403
You did good.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.084
You should be
the last one off, Mr. Sybert.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.647
Last man!

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.420
Hey, Fitz!

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.682
Turn off that search light, yeah?

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.967
We were in radio contact
with the McCullough.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.980
They said they lost four men,
but saved the rest.

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.540
The captain of the Pollock Rip
sent word that they...

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.766
Mr. Cluff!

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.500
It's the 36500! It's Bernie!

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.860
It's right there on the radio.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.760
Station Chatham? Station Chatham, copy?

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.860
CG-36500, this is Station Chatham.

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.180
Webber, is that you?

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.851
Yes, sir, it's me. It's Bernie.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.100
We got 32 survivors aboard...

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.645
from the tanker Pendleton, sir.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.084
Station Chatham, do you copy?

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.447
36500, Station Chatham.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.404
Did you say you have 32 survivors on board?

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.740
They rescued them.
They rescued 32 of them!

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.081
Yes, sir, 32.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.210
Sir, we've lost our compass,
so we don't know where we are.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.444
But we're gonna try to make it back home.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.127
Can't get back without a compass.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:39.441
- Not in this weather.
- They're not gonna make it back.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.603
You lost your compass, Webber.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.811
Negative, 36500,
this is the Pollock lightship.

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.325
Do not proceed to shore.

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.962
We're five miles northeast
of the Pendleton's last known location.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.963
Proceed to our position. Over.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.180
CG-36500, Station Chatham.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.090
Proceed to the Pollock lightship...

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.645
and unload all survivors. Over.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.330
What do they know, right?

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.969
Right, Richie?

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.646
CG-36500, do you copy?

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.540
If they know where they are
someone tell me where I am...

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.529
because I don't know
where the hell we are.

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.165
Webber, do you copy?

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.409
I'm not heading out to sea.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.801
No.

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.900
This is Station Chatham. Do you copy?

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.780
We just got you all off a boat...

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.486
so there's no way we're gonna
get you all back up one.

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.100
CG-36500, this is Station Chatham.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.202
Webber, your orders are to proceed...

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.651
five miles northeast...

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.007
and unload all survivors
onto the Pollock...

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.129
Sounds like he cut off
his radio, Mr. Cluff.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.690
He's going it on his own.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.526
Bernie Webber.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.400
What do ya know?

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.050
How are they gonna find their way home?

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.004
He must have shut off his radio.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.420
Those poor boys.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.010
I can't believe that's happening.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.881
Some more stuff in the car.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.860
Power's out now.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.246
- How they gonna see their way home?
- Power's out.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.643
The whole town. The power's out.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.201
- Worse than last year.
- They'll never make it.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.086
Let's get down to the pier.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.169
How'd you find us without a compass?

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.411
We, uh...

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.969
We just jogged along with
the seasonal currents.

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.040
I think we just got lucky.

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.361
Yeah.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.247
Lucky.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.764
So, you know how to get home?

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.407
To be honest with ya, I'm not sure.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.881
Just disobeyed all my ranking officers...

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.481
and they don't know...

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.284
so I guess I'd better then, right?

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.367
Had the wind on my left going out.

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.260
Figure if I, uh...

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.642
keep her on my right we ought to be
heading the right direction.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.180
We just follow the lights on shore.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.203
Follow all the lights on shore.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.648
Well, we're in your hands, Captain.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.561
Listen up!

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.122
I'll put the sea behind us.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.940
Just let it push us along
till we lay up somewhere.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.060
The storm's easing up, boys...

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.500
so we just look for the lights
on the shore to guide us in.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.968
Even if we have to go so far
as Nobska Point, so be it.

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.560
We just gotta find land.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.243
Been one heck of a long day,
right, fellas?

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:05.966
Yeah.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.005
Sure has.

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.606
But don't you give up hope on me now.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.286
She's a good boat. She'll get us through.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.485
We'll get you home, okay?
We're all going home.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.980
We're with you, Skipper!

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.011
Yeah!

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.928
Keep your lights on! Like she's doing!

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.860
Quick, turn your lights on!

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.660
Turn your headlights on! Everyone!

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.046
Turn 'em on!

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.842
More lights so they can see us!

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.881
I think we made it over the bar.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.700
I think high tide carried us over.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:01.644
Richie, you see that?

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.567
Fitz!

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.644
Turn on the search light!

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.604
Look, you see that?

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.480
Is it them?

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.129
Well done, Bernie!

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.300
You did it, Webber!

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.084
Way to go, Webber!

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.090
36500 is now docking at the Chatham pier.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.100
There appear to be 32 survivors, sir.

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.860
Repeat, they have 32 survivors.

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.245
That's right.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.805
Throw it, son.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.764
Attaboy, Bernie!

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.891
Give 'em a hand.

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.690
Good to see you. Get on up here.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.780
Nice and easy.

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.980
We never thought we'd see you again.

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.700
This guy's freezing. Give me your coat.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.370
Go on in. It's warm inside.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.250
Let's get you up to the lodge.

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.807
Next up. Come on, now. I got you.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.600
Good job, Captain.

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.851
Way to go, Bernie.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.321
Webber.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.361
Bernie.

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.646
Let's go home.

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.727
Are we still good for April 16th?

01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.725
I asked Cluff for ya.

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:51.287
He said it's just a...

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.930
Just a formality.

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.380
Now I know, right?

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:41.211
<i>When I was a little boy</i>

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:47.123
<i>Or so my mother told me</i>

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.125
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.801
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:04.480
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.968
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:14.366
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.769
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.420
<i>We rode it far, homeward bound</i>

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.171
<i>Took it free and easy</i>

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.122
<i>Setting sail to newfound lands</i>

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.369
<i>The wind was high and breezy</i>

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:39.140
<i>We overcome and rose above</i>

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.369
<i>The storm that we were facing</i>

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.860
<i>Finally arriving home</i>

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.328
<i>Together, warm and safely</i>

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.211
<i>Hey, haul away</i>

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:55.683
<i>Hey, haul away Joe</i>

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:59.220
<i>Hey, haul away</i>

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:02.642
<i>Hey, haul away Joe</i>

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:06.020
<i>Hey, haul away</i>

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.647
<i>Hey, haul away Joe</i>

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:12.980
<i>Hey, haul away</i>

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:16.721
<i>Hey, haul away Joe</i>

01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:28.127
<i>We sail on away</i>

01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:35.086
<i>We sail on away</i>

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.443
<i>With the music playing freely</i>

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.282
<i>Our spirits light and gay</i>

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:47.811
<i>We sail on today</i>

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.940
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.442
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.490
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.380
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.420
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:13.161
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:16.045
<i>Way, haul away</i>

01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:19.848
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.609
<i>Now up aloft</i>

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:39.250
<i>This yard must go</i>

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:47.209
<i>We'll pull her free and easy</i>

01:55:48.305 --> 01:55:54.666
