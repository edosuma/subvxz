WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:05.744
Green light.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.050
Red light.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.400
Gregory.
There you are, my guy.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.836
Hey, did you hear
this whole thing about Chris

00:10.836 --> 00:12.969
in Ms. Williams' class,
his mom?

00:12.969 --> 00:14.623
Green light.
The lady with the lip ring?

00:14.623 --> 00:15.885
Yeah, she got arrested.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.800
What?! Red light.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.845
- Go on.
- Oh, this is bonkers.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.151
Arrested for what?

00:21.151 --> 00:23.414
Mm. Protesting
workplace conditions.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.807
Oh. Green light.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.461
No, no, no, no.
It gets good.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.419
It was at that strip club,
Virgo's.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.942
Red light.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.162
Well, technically,
just outside the strip club.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.817
Yellow light.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.559
Red light.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.518
The cops throw her
in the back of the car.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.867
One of them was her cousin, though,

00:41.867 --> 00:44.044
so I think
they just drove her home.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.308
Green light.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.803
Eight-year anniversary.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.849
It's Medieval Times.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.982
He wouldn't stop speaking
in a British accent.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.506
Freed all the knights' horses,

01:11.506 --> 01:14.509
which caused
a little traffic thing, so...

01:14.509 --> 01:16.989
Tariq is in town, so I asked him

01:16.989 --> 01:18.817
to grab the rest of his stuff.

01:18.817 --> 01:22.299
I decided that when
your relationship is 100% over,

01:22.299 --> 01:23.692
your ex shouldn't be keeping,

01:23.692 --> 01:26.999
like, 90% of his things
at your place.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.480
His Pokémon plush toy, Charmeleon.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.004
He said it was the only thing
that understood him.

01:32.004 --> 01:35.356
"Dragon Ball Z," "Gundam"
figures, "Attack on Titan."

01:35.356 --> 01:37.097
A lot of anime.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.188
Wait, I think the last one
was manga?

01:41.188 --> 01:44.495
He would always get sad
when I confused the two.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.018
It's all gotta go.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.411
Good morning.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.804
Ooh, I love that jacket.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.327
That's so cute. Love it.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.503
Hey, no running in there!

01:52.503 --> 01:53.678
Please have a seat.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.680
Mm. Yellin' at 'em.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.073
Just like on TV.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.597
Hey.

01:59.597 --> 02:00.729
'Sup, lower case?

02:00.729 --> 02:01.991
Oh, Khalil.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.384
He's doing great.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.037
Kid's got his seven multiples
down now.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.562
Try not to take him on
a field trip to the casino.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.172
Okay.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.308
Thank you.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.658
And I thank you, Joshua.

02:16.658 --> 02:19.051
Hey, keep your head up,
Mr. C.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.792
We know
you're trying your best.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.185
Excuse me?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.666
I saw the commercial
about the school on Hulu

02:24.666 --> 02:26.407
when I was watching
"One-Punch Man."

02:26.407 --> 02:28.148
Oh. Great show.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.280
I love that he can defeat
anyone with just one punch,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.890
yet when tasked
with the mundane, he--

02:31.890 --> 02:33.370
Wait, what commercial?

02:33.370 --> 02:35.067
Uh... ooh.

02:36.243 --> 02:39.420
There is a commercial running
saying how bad Abbott is,

02:39.420 --> 02:40.812
and we are all in it.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.553
Jacob, we're munching
on our lunches.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.903
Wait, a commercial?

02:44.903 --> 02:47.384
That's why that parent said
something about me on TV.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.386
Was there a bit
about me gambling?

02:49.386 --> 02:51.040
'Cause a parent said something

02:51.040 --> 02:52.824
that almost triggered
my fight-or-fight response.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.304
Mm, you mean
fight or flight.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.654
No. I'm not a flippin' bird,
Gregory.

02:56.654 --> 02:59.135
There's a commercial
with all of us.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.093
Turn on the TV!Yeah.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.926
<i>So, come on down
to Katrina's Braid Emporium.</i>

03:07.926 --> 03:10.320
<i>Nigerian braids,
American prices.</i>

03:10.320 --> 03:12.192
<i>Located at--</i> There has to be a better way.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.758
Y'all not gonna believe this,
but I was watching "Gourders,"

03:13.758 --> 03:15.325
that show about
pumpkin hoarders,

03:15.325 --> 03:17.806
and a commercial about Abbott
came on. It's bad.

03:17.806 --> 03:20.156
I had to watch two more episodes
- before it played again.
- Oh.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.028
<i>Philadelphia students</i>

03:23.028 --> 03:26.162
<i>deserve to have
a quality education.</i>

03:26.162 --> 03:28.860
<i>It's impossible
for these students to succeed</i>

03:28.860 --> 03:32.516
<i>because traditional
public schools are failing.</i>

03:34.779 --> 03:37.391
<i>They don't need teachers
with shady backgrounds.</i>

03:37.391 --> 03:39.044
<i>Feels light.</i>

03:39.044 --> 03:41.264
<i>Alright, which one of youse
is holding out on me?</i>

03:41.264 --> 03:44.441
<i>Shouldn't our children be
allowed to express themselves?</i>

03:44.441 --> 03:49.316
<i>Please stop dancing.</i>

03:49.316 --> 03:51.796
<i>They don't need teachers
that belittle their culture.</i>

03:51.796 --> 03:53.581
<i>Good job, dawg!</i>

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
<i>Arf! Arf!</i>

03:55.322 --> 03:58.673
<i>Don't our children deserve
teachers they respect?</i>

03:58.673 --> 04:00.065
<i>Alaya.</i>

04:00.065 --> 04:02.633
<i>Sit down.</i>

04:02.633 --> 04:06.724
<i>If you have any respect for

04:06.724 --> 04:09.510

04:17.300 --> 04:19.824
<i>Yeah!</i>

04:19.824 --> 04:22.827
<i>♪ Legendary Schools♪</i>

04:22.827 --> 04:25.003
Is this a diss track?
Let me get in the booth.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.005
I don't even sound like that, dawg.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.181
This buffoonery
will not stand.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.357
How did they even get
this footage?

04:30.357 --> 04:33.316
- Yeah.
- A camera crew came in.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.057
I thought
it was one of them.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.798
Oh, like y'all can tell
these moderately attractive

04:36.798 --> 04:38.365
white men with beards apart.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.844
What's even under there?

04:39.844 --> 04:42.543
See, this is why I never
trusted any of youse.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.022
Now, get the cameras
out of my face

04:44.022 --> 04:45.850
before I give you
a colonoscopy with it.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.765
We need to get this commercial
taken down.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.114
Yes.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.768
And just so
you parents know,

04:50.768 --> 04:53.641
any commercials you may have
seen are not true.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.687
This is an excellent school,
and your children are learning.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.603
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, it <i>is</i> right.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.736
But, like...

05:03.215 --> 05:04.782
Hey, girl, hey!

05:04.782 --> 05:07.655
So, I started watching that show
about couponing savants.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.699
Uh-huh.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.353
Couldn't get into it. Oh.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.529
You truly do have the taste of
a middle-aged Midwestern mama.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.096
Well, thank you, Erika.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.576
Oh, what are you doing
tomorrow?

05:15.576 --> 05:17.708
I found a new paint-and-sip,
but this one got hookah.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.841
Oh!
Oh, but I can't.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.886
Tariq is coming by my place
to pick up his stuff tomorrow.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.366
Girl.
"Girl"?

05:23.366 --> 05:24.759
You can't have that man
come to your crib.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.413
Why not?
We're broken up.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.892
It's history. Exactly.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.460
Too much <i>history</i> there.

05:30.460 --> 05:34.159
Listen, you need to meet him
someplace neutral and unsexy.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.336
- Okay.
- Like, um, a school parking lot.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.120
- Mm.
- Or like a cheesesteak spot.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.558
Well, he finds shaved meat sexy,
so parking lot it is.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.821
- Let me know how it go.
- Okay.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.045
I got surprises.
I can do surprises.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.920
Psst! I think we might
just be able to nip

05:55.920 --> 05:57.139
this commercial in the bud.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.054
Melissa called in a favor.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.621
And now you've made me
an accessory.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.100
She's got a friend
who's a lawyer.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.188
Oh, fun.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.625
Okay.
Yeah.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.714
- Mr. F.A.D.E.!
- Aw, yeah.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.065
Wassup, my little
No Limit Solders?

06:10.065 --> 06:11.762
How y'all doing?
Yeah.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.155
Hey, Tariq.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.765
What are you doing
in here?

06:14.765 --> 06:16.550
I told you to come at noon
and to wait in the parking lot.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.378
I know, but these are
my day ones.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.728
Had to come say "what's up"
to the little studious homies.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.817
Ms. Teagues,
can we show Mr. F.A.D.E.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.035
the new sight words we know?

06:24.035 --> 06:26.342
- Ooh. Yes, yes.
- Yeah!

06:26.342 --> 06:28.431
Ooh, pwease,
Ms. Teagues?

06:28.431 --> 06:29.650
Pwease?

06:29.650 --> 06:30.912
I love your skirt,
by the way.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.087
Makes me want to play
"Candy Land."

06:32.087 --> 06:33.349
Oh. Thank you.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.611
I knew it was giving
Princess Lolly.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.570
You're doing it.
You're doing it.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.006
Look, I have to teach,

06:38.006 --> 06:41.444
but I guess you can stay
for a little while.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.880
I'm chilling. Okay.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.755
Alright. Tell me about
these on-sight words, y'all.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.539
What, they trying to catch
these hands or something?

06:51.019 --> 06:53.282
I did worry it might be awkward,

06:53.282 --> 06:56.851
but I don't think
it's actually possible

06:56.851 --> 06:58.766
to be awkward around Tariq.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.202
- No, it's good.
- Good news, too, so...

07:00.202 --> 07:01.725
- Yeah.
- I'm-- I'm super-hype.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.466
- Me too.
- Oh, I hate to be
the perpetual resident

07:03.466 --> 07:05.207
of Buzzkill, Pennsylvania,

07:05.207 --> 07:07.427
but, uh, we are meeting
with the lawyer any minute--

07:07.427 --> 07:08.732
I <i>am</i> the lawyer.

07:08.732 --> 07:09.820
Oh.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.126
Of course you are.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.649
I knew that.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.695
"Erin Brockovich" is, like,
my favorite movie.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.437
This is Candace.
She's a friend of my family,

07:17.437 --> 07:20.048
and she's a beast
in the courtroom.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.745
Candace is the reason
why Martha Stewart

07:21.745 --> 07:22.964
had a window in her cell.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.356
- Oh.
- Oh.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.836
Melissa briefed me
on what's going on,

07:25.836 --> 07:27.316
and it sounds like you have
a strong enough case

07:27.316 --> 07:29.013
to sue these chumps
for all they're worth.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.407
Yes. I knew this principal thing
would work out for me one day.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.495
Now, how much money
are we talking?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.105
Like, a foldable stack?

07:34.105 --> 07:36.847
To be clear, this camera crew
trespassed, right?

07:36.847 --> 07:38.980
Well, actually,
I let them in.

07:38.980 --> 07:42.505
Okay, but they used
your likeness without consent.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.464
Yeah, well,
we did sign these.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.423
Um... but they misrepresented
what they were doing?

07:47.423 --> 07:51.035
Well, they did say they were
coming to get footage of us,

07:51.035 --> 07:52.515
- which they did.
- Yeah.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.910
Okay, so, uh,
what I'm seeing here is,

07:55.910 --> 07:58.042
you guys just failed
to pay attention

07:58.042 --> 07:59.304
to what was happening.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.741
You have
absolutely no case,

08:00.741 --> 08:02.220
and, in fact,
according to this,

08:02.220 --> 08:05.267
you might each owe
Legendary Charters,

08:05.267 --> 08:07.399
yeah,
$200 for crew fees.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.097
- For what?
- Candace!

08:09.097 --> 08:10.707
I don't--Melissa: Let them try
to get the money.

08:10.707 --> 08:11.839
Wait, so you are saying that
we're just gonna have

08:11.839 --> 08:13.362
to see this commercial forever,

08:13.362 --> 08:15.364
and there's no way
we can get it off the air?

08:15.364 --> 08:17.453
You could pay for Hulu
without commercials.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.281
- D--
- Mm-hmm.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.630
Aw, yeah.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.936
My dawg.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.372
Thanks for giving me
some of that good TP.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.591
Mm.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.201
You know, we can't get this
in New York.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.419
You look good, by the way.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.595
Oh.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.118
Thank you.
You look good, too.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.642
I mean, glad to hear
you're killing it up there,

08:32.642 --> 08:34.122
selling out
those school auditoriums.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.384
I mean, that's the dream.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.081
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.997
I mean, keep it on the down low,
but, uh, I'm in talks to play

08:39.997 --> 08:43.348
Nick Cannon's
next baby shower.

08:43.348 --> 08:44.393
'Kay.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.003
Uh, alright.

08:46.003 --> 08:49.267
Well, um, glad it's all
finally happening for you.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.921
Yeah.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.968
Alright, well, I should
probably get back to class.

08:53.968 --> 08:58.363
Or-- Or we could continue this
conversation at Bahama Breeze.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.932
Old time's sake?

09:03.281 --> 09:04.848
It's just dinner.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.807
I was gonna have dinner anyway.

09:06.807 --> 09:11.594
But now it's with someone
I used to date for a decade.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.988
So, I'm just a single girl
having dinner

09:13.988 --> 09:17.557
with the only person I've ever
had a sexual relationship with.

09:20.342 --> 09:21.865
I did it.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.607
I found the dirty rat in charge
of Legendary Charters.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.349
Melissa Schemmenti
comes through again.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.350
How'd you do it?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.308
Oh, I've got my ways.

09:30.308 --> 09:31.788
I Googled it.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.486
But I like to maintain
that air of dark mystery.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.228
Scumbag's name
is Draemond Winding.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.621
He's a real piece of work.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.362
He's a big name
in New York charter schools.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.277
Now he's got his sights
set on Philly.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.714
Well, what's our next move?
How do we get to this guy?

09:44.714 --> 09:46.194
- Find his grandma.
- Find his mother's mother.

09:46.194 --> 09:49.763
I say we just let this thing
wind itself down.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.679
Not the first time anyone's said
anything bad about Abbott,

09:52.679 --> 09:54.594
and it certainly
won't be the last.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.292
What's with the change
in tune?

09:57.292 --> 09:58.902
The more we fight this,

09:58.902 --> 10:00.512
the more attention
we bring to the commercial.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.862
Okay, but this is personal.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.472
They called us bad teachers.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.300
Yeah, uh, not all of us.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.650
Some of us came off looking
pretty good in that commercial.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.174
That is not
what this is about.

10:10.174 --> 10:13.177
Then what's it about...
Barb?

10:13.177 --> 10:16.485
I do not agree with anything
in that commercial.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.922
I just think that we need
to find a different way

10:18.922 --> 10:20.707
to get what we want.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.491
If-- If we stoop
to their level,

10:22.491 --> 10:24.667
we're no better
than they are.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.321
They go low, we go high.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.192
Yeah.
Eyes, nose, throat.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.890
No.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.850
Ayo, talent manager,

10:33.850 --> 10:35.330
what you doing hanging out
with that dirt?

10:35.330 --> 10:36.984
Oh, nothing. I just like
coming out to the garden.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.551
I don't ever touch it or do
anything to make it better.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.466
You're a weird dude.

10:41.466 --> 10:42.685
That's cool.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.382
And, um,
what are you doing here?

10:44.382 --> 10:45.557
Oh, you know, I'm just picking
some stuff up.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.820

- Yeah, yeah.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.868
You know, we're gonna see
how it goes,

10:51.868 --> 10:54.697
but maybe afterwards
go to a Redbox,

10:54.697 --> 10:56.307
take it back to her place,
you know?

10:56.307 --> 10:58.222
You know what her favorite
movie is, by the way?

10:58.222 --> 11:00.224
You don't know what
Janine's favorite movie is?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.574
I think it was "Up."

11:02.574 --> 11:04.446
Maybe it was "Us."

11:04.446 --> 11:07.231
Something with an "uh" sound
somewhere in there.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.406
I've been taking
these new brain pills

11:08.406 --> 11:09.494
that got nootropics
in them.

11:09.494 --> 11:12.062
They clearly
"noot" working.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.498
I said, "They 'noot' working."Yeah, I heard you.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.718

17:46.804 --> 17:48.632
you made the right decision.

17:48.632 --> 17:51.548
My sandwich is half-eaten,

17:51.548 --> 17:53.289
but my cup is half-full.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.770
This is wild.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.079
You know, I remember spending
plenty of time in this corner

18:00.079 --> 18:01.384
when I'd get in trouble.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.647
Oh, you had
your good moments, too.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.652
Draemond,
nothing makes me happier

18:08.652 --> 18:11.002
than seeing
my students succeed,

18:11.002 --> 18:14.963
and you have surpassed
every expectation.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.312
You know, when I left
your class,

18:16.312 --> 18:19.359
I bounced around public schools,
totally lost.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.012
I ended up at a charter,
and they gave me

18:21.012 --> 18:24.625
a fighting chance
to become the man I am today.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.497
But you can't blame everything
that was going on in your life

18:27.497 --> 18:29.847
at that time
on all public schools.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.110
Can't you see?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.285
I'm trying to make
schools better

18:32.285 --> 18:34.287
for the Barbara Howards
of the world.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.420
Draemond, what you are doing
hurts teachers like me.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.554
You're still teaching me, huh?

18:42.164 --> 18:43.818
Yo.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.647
Hey.
You ready to go?
I'm starving.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.215
I've been thinking about
that Jamaican Jerk Shrimp
Pineapple Bowl all day.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.433
Booyaka!

18:50.433 --> 18:52.174
All I had to eat today

18:52.174 --> 18:54.263
was half that sandwich, so...

18:54.263 --> 18:55.482
You know what?

18:55.482 --> 18:57.136
I have had a long day, Tariq,

18:57.136 --> 18:59.529
so I think I'm just
gonna hang at home.

18:59.529 --> 19:00.748
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.271
We can just
get the food to go

19:02.271 --> 19:04.317
and then go hang
at our pl-- <i>your</i> place.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.320
Maybe we can, uh,
watch your favorite movie.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.932
You know, the one with...

19:10.932 --> 19:12.325
ol' boy.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.241
Yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

19:15.241 --> 19:19.201
Tariq, I think it's best
if we have a platonic,

19:19.201 --> 19:21.638
non-meal-sharing
relationship.

19:23.814 --> 19:24.859
Yeah.
Right?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.121
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.340
That's cool, 'Neen.
That's cool.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.211
I'll just have my girlfriend
take me.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.430
Your what?
Girlfriend.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.127
Third woman
I've ever been with.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.998
Might as well be the fourth
with the things we be doing.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.304
You know
- what I'm talking about?
- I don't.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.740
Hey, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.481
Dinner with my ex
got canceled, so, uh,

19:38.481 --> 19:40.179
I'm free
to hang out with you now.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.397
Okay, boo-boo.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.573
Yeah.
Buh-bye.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.750
Guess you're not going out
with him, then?

19:46.750 --> 19:48.274
No. No.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.928
I'm probably gonna just go home
and watch a movie.

19:50.928 --> 19:51.929
"Jumanji"?

19:51.929 --> 19:54.062
It is my favorite.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.716
See you in the morning, Gregory.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.596
Draemond and I had
a little chat.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.989
He'll be taking
the commercial down.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.165
- Oh!
- Yes! Yes!

20:10.165 --> 20:12.646
Only Barb can still school
her kids after all this time.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.213
But I will say that
that commercial

20:14.213 --> 20:16.127
did catch my good side,

20:16.127 --> 20:19.130
and I hope Jim Gardner caught it
before it came down.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.610
Barb.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.959
Okay, fam.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.744
Come on.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.528
Barbara doesn't see that
I'm trying to help her,

20:25.528 --> 20:26.529
but that's okay.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.270
The visit has inspired me.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.924
The commercial is neither
here nor there,

20:29.924 --> 20:33.319
because I'm gonna turn
every school in Philadelphia

20:33.319 --> 20:35.451
into a Legendary Charter School.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.801
Next up-- Abbott Elementary.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.762
Tell me that's not catchy.
You can't.

20:44.808 --> 20:47.898
Oh, oh, yeah, the anti-drug
stuff's been going real good.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.335
Shout-out to F.A.D.E.
for believing in your boy.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.512
I just put out my album,
"METH-od to My Madness,"

20:52.512 --> 20:54.601
on Reeq Reqords. Yup.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.646
That thing went double mahogany.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.822
Yeah.
It's on top of The Chartz,

20:58.822 --> 21:01.216
which is a Spotify playlist
that I made.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.478
Check that out.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.088
Uh, what else?

21:04.088 --> 21:05.873
Been hitting up a lot
of New York Liberty games,

21:05.873 --> 21:07.831
trying to get on them
halftime shows, you know?

21:07.831 --> 21:09.398
Them ladies tall...

21:09.398 --> 21:11.618
which is my new type.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.881
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.362
Oh, recently just did this, uh,
commercial jingle, too.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.321
♪ Legendary Schools

21:19.321 --> 21:21.323
Yeah.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.238
Came up with the melody myself.
