WEBVTT

00:08.039 --> 00:12.540
_

00:18.160 --> 00:19.800
Confined again.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.320
I cannot bear it.

00:24.680 --> 00:27.520
The very world itself seems sick.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.680
A most ungenial summer.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.940
I've never known air as dank and frigid.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.100
Oh!

00:38.860 --> 00:40.041
"Dank and frigid"?

00:40.042 --> 00:42.719
Who does that remind me of? I wonder.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.880
Oh!

00:45.300 --> 00:47.940
Sleep well, sweet boy.

00:49.920 --> 00:54.000
Perhaps Lord Byron or
Dr Polidori would read to us?

00:55.880 --> 00:57.820
What would Miss Clairmont wish to hear?

00:58.620 --> 01:01.000
Something to awaken thrilling horror.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.060
Yes, Mrs Shelley.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.119
To make us dread to look around.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.140
To curdle the blood and quicken
the beatings of the heart.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.959
I have just the thing.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.320
Oh...

01:24.260 --> 01:27.140
Tales of the dead.

01:35.013 --> 01:37.613
"At midnight, we took a torch
to the chapel.

01:39.262 --> 01:41.821
With pallid countenance
and trembling limbs,

01:41.822 --> 01:43.820
we descended to the vault.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.960
Hildegarde's leaden coffin
loomed before us.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.799
The Count was seized with the
sensations of terror."

01:59.280 --> 02:02.519
"He opened the coffin with a
stifled cry of dread

02:03.260 --> 02:04.960
and inside we saw..."

02:07.680 --> 02:11.479
I shall send whoever calls away,
my lord.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.896
No, Fletcher.

02:12.897 --> 02:14.360
What if it is she?

02:16.100 --> 02:18.679
Hildegarde, the death-bride.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.620
If something infernal is on my doorstep,

02:21.900 --> 02:23.639
I should be the one to go and greet it.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.680
Infernal?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.520
Surely not?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.980
Who is brave enough to come and see?

02:38.840 --> 02:42.159
I'll wager it's Shelley,
amusing himself with a trick.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.839
Shelley is not one for tricks.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.339
There is nothing to be afraid of.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.399
Good evening! Not quite
the welcome I was hoping for,

03:35.400 --> 03:37.479
but I'll admit we've looked better.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.239
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintances. I'm...

03:44.800 --> 03:46.360
Nothing?

03:47.526 --> 03:48.686
Weird.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.447
Might need a blow-dry.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.168
Got a bit caught in the downpour.

03:52.169 --> 03:55.386
Yes, because it is a truth
universally acknowledged...

03:55.387 --> 03:56.547
Wrong writer!

03:58.022 --> 04:01.239
...that one's driver will park
one's carriage

04:01.240 --> 04:04.839
imprudently too far
from whence one is going.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.720
Can we please just come in before we
drown to death? Please.

04:20.595 --> 04:22.119
One hour, tops.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.261
Plus drying time.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.319
OK, so there was a spot of rain...

04:25.320 --> 04:27.199
...and gale-force wind
and a super-long walk,

04:27.200 --> 04:28.313
but I got us here, didn't I?

04:28.314 --> 04:31.319
And Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin,
soon to be Shelley,

04:31.320 --> 04:32.519
screamed in your face.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.559
Quality historical experience,
that. Gold!

04:35.560 --> 04:39.119
On that night that
inspired Frankenstein.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.519
If... you'd be so kind...

04:41.520 --> 04:42.840
Blimey!

04:43.840 --> 04:45.959
Excuse me, Yaz. I was
very clear about the roles.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.119
Nobody mention Frankenstein
and don't interfere.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.959
And nobody snog Byron.

04:51.635 --> 04:54.039
In, out, soak up the atmos.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.839
Witness some of the most
enlightened minds

04:56.840 --> 04:58.679
of a generation at the pinnacle,

04:58.680 --> 05:01.200
the absolute zenith of their
creativity...

05:09.680 --> 05:11.479
What would you all care to drink?

05:11.480 --> 05:13.999
We shall teach them the dance.

05:22.854 --> 05:25.239
I detest all gossip, you understand.

05:25.839 --> 05:27.559
Utterly abhor it.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.507
Mary goes by Mrs Shelley,

05:29.508 --> 05:32.079
except she and Percy are not married.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.207
It really is quite a scandal.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.599
Lord Byron is separated from his wife.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.319
The rumours are so disastrous,
he cannot return to England.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.119
Now he keeps company with
Mary's step-sister,

05:43.120 --> 05:44.599
Miss Clairmont.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.620
We have an exceptionally strong
attachment.

05:47.678 --> 05:51.919
She scrambled 500 miles from England
to come and see me here.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.400
Couldn't exactly turn her away.

05:55.449 --> 05:58.439
Please... excuse me, fair lady.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.519
I must poppeth to the little boys' room.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.679
So... that was marvellous.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.279
Is anyone up for, I don't know,

06:07.280 --> 06:10.879
I'm spitballing here, how about
writing the most gruesome,

06:10.880 --> 06:14.120
spine-chilling ghost story of all time?

06:16.045 --> 06:18.073
<i>Dormez bien, Monsieur William.</i>

06:36.740 --> 06:38.559
You know? A bit of blood and guts?

06:38.560 --> 06:40.599
Throw in a corpse for good measure.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.799
Float anyone's boat? Mary?

06:43.580 --> 06:44.919
Or perhaps another quadrille?

06:44.920 --> 06:46.860
- I shall choose the music.
- Hear, hear!

06:46.861 --> 06:49.519
Excuse me, Doctor. You broke a rule.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.199
Next, you'll be snogging Byron.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.439
I was trying to get them back on track.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.479
Something's wrong here.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.639
This night, June 1816,

06:57.640 --> 07:00.550
Byron challenges Mary Polidori
and Percy Shelley

07:00.551 --> 07:02.759
to come up with a ghost story.
Spot the difference!

07:02.760 --> 07:04.111
You and I shall be partners
for the next dance.

07:04.112 --> 07:05.760
Not much writing going on.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.559
And there's no Shelley.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.971
Bingo! They're a man down.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.880
Why?

07:18.783 --> 07:20.223
Sorry, love.

07:20.224 --> 07:21.679
- Oh. Oh.
- <i>Mon Dieu.</i>

07:21.680 --> 07:23.679
Crikey. A bit lost.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.549
Looking for the lavatory?

07:25.550 --> 07:27.210
<i>C'est diabolique, monsieur!</i>

07:27.796 --> 07:29.040
<i>C'est terrible.</i>

07:32.380 --> 07:34.300
Never mind. I can hold it.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.560
Big house like this,
there's got to be a lav somewhere.

08:15.686 --> 08:17.306
I'm going round in circles here.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.546
It is impolite not to announce
oneself, Miss Khan.

08:48.547 --> 08:50.245
Breaking and entering's worse.

08:50.246 --> 08:53.199
I'm not at fault if Lord Byron
selfishly keeps it locked.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.520
What are you after?

08:57.569 --> 08:58.800
Letters.

09:00.319 --> 09:04.131
If he's written about me, I can
ascertain his true sentiments.

09:10.095 --> 09:11.240
Or...

09:13.520 --> 09:15.359
...you could try asking him.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.959
I have.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.200
His answers only increase the enigma.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.200
I know someone like that.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.260
Mary reproaches me...

09:28.173 --> 09:30.893
...and says I should find
a more reliable prospect.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.040
Not that she can talk.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.155
Perhaps she's right.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.460
His eye does seem to wander.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.320
This enigmatic person of yours...

09:45.807 --> 09:48.080
...would you trade them
for reliable and dull?

09:49.660 --> 09:51.327
My person's a bit different.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.760
Did you see that?

09:55.800 --> 09:56.985
What?

10:01.099 --> 10:02.492
Nothing.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.720
Trick of the light.

10:15.403 --> 10:18.517
She walks in beauty, like the night.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.640
Of cloudless climes and starry skies.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.279
I'm intensely flattered

10:26.280 --> 10:28.439
you're familiar with my work,
Mrs Doctor.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.280
Just "Doctor" is fine.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.439
I'm quite into Shelley's stuff
too. He about?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.120
Indisposed, I'm afraid.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.659
He won't be joining us.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.079
May I be candid?

10:41.080 --> 10:42.599
Go for it.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.934
I sent my man out to fetch
your carriage,

10:44.935 --> 10:47.520
but it seems to have disappeared.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.392
Such a jaunty air!

11:06.393 --> 11:08.159
Is it popular in the colonies?

11:08.160 --> 11:09.879
Er... Yeah.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.629
Me nan taught me, but I always
get the keys wrong.

11:13.630 --> 11:16.080
But she always said there's no
reason not to try.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.747
I should practise more.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.119
But I confess, I prefer to write...

11:22.120 --> 11:24.812
- Hm.
- ...even though my efforts are weak.

11:24.813 --> 11:27.362
I could never hope to match the
achievements of my parents.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.602
My nan would say stick with it.

11:30.880 --> 11:31.920
Hm.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.640
What's his problem?

11:36.440 --> 11:37.440
Oh...

11:37.960 --> 11:39.599
Pay Dr Polidori no heed.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.479
He's bad-tempered because
he does not sleep.

11:43.609 --> 11:45.303
He walks at night.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.799
A terrible affliction.

11:47.353 --> 11:50.833
Imagine... never being able to
truly rest.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.420
I'm fully aware of what you want!

11:53.965 --> 11:55.252
Please reveal all.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.220
My third canto.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.860
Of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage,
my work in progress.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.460
Nah, it goes on a bit,
that one. No offence.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.180
Nice mention of Ada, though.
Big fan of hers.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.439
You know of my daughter?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.559
Will do. Gorgeous brain.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.920
Why are you here?

12:16.040 --> 12:17.879
For a quick visit, supposedly,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.759
but I'm getting this really
weird vibe off your house.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.359
- Vibe?
- Yeah.

12:23.780 --> 12:25.180
I don't want to worry you,

12:25.921 --> 12:27.839
but I'm sensing that it's sort of...

12:27.840 --> 12:29.880
...unrelentingly evil.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.599
Ryan, it's like a maze up there,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.702
and they're a few years shy of a toilet.

12:38.703 --> 12:41.039
- Sir?
- Oh, blimey!

12:41.040 --> 12:43.419
You've got to stop doing that.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.239
Splendid. Very convenient.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.919
Ryan, not a khazi for love nor money,

12:48.920 --> 12:51.479
and a French woman who's got
a right hump about something.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.639
Mrs Shelley seems fatigued.

12:54.098 --> 12:55.839
Only of waiting to dance.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.719
You're the one who looks like death.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.185
Do you insult my visage, sir?

12:59.186 --> 13:00.679
You might want to stop shooting daggers

13:00.680 --> 13:02.524
- and maybe take a nap, all right?
- I beg your pardon?

13:02.525 --> 13:04.445
He means, perhaps you should
take a rest.

13:04.446 --> 13:06.839
I'm a physician. I'm in rude health.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.679
Whatever you say, mate.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.400
Then I say choose, sir!

13:11.549 --> 13:13.919
Sorry. He does this rather a lot.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.190
- Choose your weapon!
- What?

13:16.191 --> 13:17.639
Isn't it obvious?

13:17.640 --> 13:19.239
He's challenging you to a duel.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.140
Oh... Look, hey, look,
I'm not here to fight anyone,

13:22.141 --> 13:23.604
- so everyone just calm down.
- Fletcher!

13:23.605 --> 13:25.300
You will be my second.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.228
- Will Mr O'Brien be yours?
- No!

13:28.229 --> 13:30.170
- Cheers, mate.
- No, what I mean... No,

13:30.171 --> 13:33.119
- because there's going to be no duel.
- I absolutely forbid it.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.992
- Ooh! Ooh!
- What's up? What's up?

13:35.993 --> 13:38.434
I shall return with my pistol.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.740
He's getting a gun. He's getting
a gun. He's getting a gun.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.319
Whatever is that?

13:53.100 --> 13:54.136
No...

13:54.860 --> 13:55.919
I think it's a...

13:56.460 --> 13:58.959
...hand! It's definitely a hand!

13:58.960 --> 14:00.439
Get it off him.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.279
Doc! It's so strong!

14:03.280 --> 14:04.520
And ferocious!

14:08.872 --> 14:10.432
Great shot.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.787
Hmm.

14:18.788 --> 14:21.080
14th. No...

14:21.081 --> 14:23.159
15th century. Touch more umami.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.081
- She licked it!
- She is the most baffling creature

14:26.082 --> 14:27.746
I've ever been acquainted with.

14:27.747 --> 14:31.679
Human. Protein. Collagen and...

14:31.680 --> 14:33.199
...nothing abnormal.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.426
What kind of implement is that?

14:35.427 --> 14:38.639
One that zaps people's heads off who
threaten people with guns.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.291
I don't think they're really from
the colonies.

14:41.292 --> 14:45.999
No. She is from somewhere
much, much stranger.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.879
The north.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.199
How did it come to life, then?
Was it haunted or something?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.457
Unlikely.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.791
Well, you did say the house was evil.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.799
Well, that's a development.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.312
I've been getting a vibe.

14:59.313 --> 15:01.880
If there is evil here,
I know who brought it in.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.040
Very well. I may have
a skeleton... in my chamber.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.040
Right. You keep an eye on Trigger Happy.

15:14.506 --> 15:17.026
Me and you need to take a squiz at
your skeleton.

15:30.359 --> 15:31.597
It's a collection.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.199
Of what? Dead stuff?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.299
Relics of war.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.880
From my travels.

15:38.520 --> 15:43.312
Reminders that we tread on the
dust of empires.

15:44.339 --> 15:47.020
Crops now grow where blood was split.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.319
An innocent fascination, I assure you.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.679
Waterloo!

15:50.680 --> 15:53.000
Oh! I love a good plume!

15:54.160 --> 15:55.719
What do you think?

15:56.360 --> 15:58.440
A 15th-century soldier...

16:00.240 --> 16:02.580
...from the Battle of Morat.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.260
His final remains.

16:08.182 --> 16:09.479
One hand gone.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.881
Both hands gone.

16:11.882 --> 16:14.002
Great. There's another on the loose.

16:14.003 --> 16:15.213
Keep your eyes peeled.

16:15.214 --> 16:17.480
Anything else strange happen
since you've been here?

16:19.640 --> 16:23.719
When the weather turned,
Shelley began having visions.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.000
He's prone to them.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.159
What did he see?

16:27.900 --> 16:29.319
An apparition of a figure...

16:29.320 --> 16:31.080
...floating above the lake.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.599
When you said he was indisposed,
what did you mean?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.239
Uh, well, when he didn't join us,

16:38.240 --> 16:40.444
my mind naturally wandered to
the idea of

16:40.445 --> 16:44.559
some torrid assignation in town.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.700
Shelley often retires to our
chalet... to write.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.139
Maison Chapuis. On the shore.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.580
You should probably pop down
and have a chat.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.780
You're like ninjas, you lot.

17:11.346 --> 17:14.319
Fair play to you, though, love. Food!

17:14.319 --> 17:15.838
There's never any food.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.638
Cheers. You're a belter. Yeah.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.067
Baby-sitting duty. Yeah.

17:22.068 --> 17:24.673
He'll be no trouble now,
though. Dead to the world.

17:25.314 --> 17:28.686
This apparition, did Shelley
describe it in any more detail?

17:28.687 --> 17:31.740
Dark. Charred by fire.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.079
Suspended over the water
like a death god rising from Hades.

17:37.452 --> 17:39.012
Right...

17:39.013 --> 17:40.693
Nothing too sinister, then.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.560
You can ask him more questions
when we get to the chalet.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.400
Did we just go down to the top?

17:56.053 --> 17:59.013
What reanimates bones
and leaves no trace?

17:59.014 --> 18:01.309
Why just the hands? Why only parts?

18:01.310 --> 18:03.680
- However, my collection's not demonic?
- Correct.

18:04.306 --> 18:06.220
But I'll probably come back
for this, though.

18:06.646 --> 18:09.239
Strictly for, er, safety purposes.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.540
Not because it really suits me
or anything.

18:12.280 --> 18:16.439
This vibe you mentioned,
is it still there?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.999
Yeah. I can't...

18:19.000 --> 18:20.839
It's like it won't let me think.

18:21.252 --> 18:23.100
I need to get out of this house.

18:32.253 --> 18:34.593
Easier said than done, apparently.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.503
- Oh... How many times now?
- Seven?

18:40.504 --> 18:44.079
Mrs Doctor said the house
was evil. She must be right.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.119
It's turning against us.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.439
A house can't do that.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.480
Even an evil one.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.559
Oh, don't worry. We're great at
sorting things out like this.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.159
There's always an explanation...

19:01.160 --> 19:03.465
Oh, it touched me! Ghost! Ghost.

19:03.466 --> 19:05.051
It definitely touched me.

19:05.052 --> 19:07.519
Ryan, that was my elbow.

19:08.354 --> 19:09.699
I knew that.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.230
I totally knew that.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.606
Please tell me
there's a real baby in here.

19:17.607 --> 19:20.820
My son, William. I must get to him!

19:53.180 --> 19:54.748
You're going nowhere, pal.

19:54.749 --> 19:56.780
You're staying right there.
I'm on guard.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.999
Oh...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.320
Hey! Poli?

20:02.480 --> 20:04.260
Poli? Hello?

20:05.253 --> 20:06.293
Poli?

20:07.720 --> 20:10.191
Poli? Can you hear me, son?

20:11.480 --> 20:12.960
Can you hear me?

20:25.304 --> 20:26.937
The same chamber.

20:27.473 --> 20:29.180
Over and over.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.519
- How is it possible?
- It's not.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.439
- It's...
- Like a dream.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.859
Elise!

20:36.313 --> 20:38.033
Can you hear me?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.019
Do you have William?

20:40.825 --> 20:42.519
He'll be OK.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.239
He probably just cried himself
out and fell asleep.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.978
Doc! Poli! Doc! Doc!

20:54.660 --> 20:56.566
There's something seriously
wrong with this gaff.

20:56.567 --> 20:58.319
Is anyone else trapped?

20:58.320 --> 21:01.435
Yeah. And I think I'm seeing
dead people.

21:07.710 --> 21:10.093
- Perfect...
- We're the same!

21:10.094 --> 21:11.654
I totally saw a ghost.

21:11.655 --> 21:14.119
- We're stuck on the stairs!
- Please!

21:14.120 --> 21:16.301
How do we move upwards?

21:16.302 --> 21:18.578
I need to check my son is well.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.759
Working on it! Head's a bit fuzzy.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.919
Normal service will resume shortly.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.919
- And ghosts don't exist.
- Of course not!

21:27.740 --> 21:30.119
You two just need a spray tan
and a kip, eh?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.598
Graham, what sort of
dead people, exactly?

21:32.599 --> 21:35.898
Oh... How can I hear your voice, Doc?

21:35.899 --> 21:38.702
I'm using the fireplace chimney.

21:38.703 --> 21:39.999
Doc?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.360
Graham?

21:42.600 --> 21:43.799
Graham?

21:44.359 --> 21:45.919
They've gone now.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.120
And...

21:47.680 --> 21:48.959
...so's Polidori.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.329
- I've lost him.
- You had one job!

21:51.330 --> 21:53.461
Yeah, made more challenging
by his ability

21:53.462 --> 21:55.775
- to walk through walls!
- Through?

21:55.776 --> 21:58.319
He just turned sort of zombie
and went into one.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.479
What do you speak of? What is a zombie?

22:00.480 --> 22:01.733
Mrs Doctor?

22:01.734 --> 22:03.919
Kind of a dead person walking,
but it won't be that.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.657
- Mrs Doctor?
- How do you know?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.640
Because Polidori isn't dead,
for a kick-off.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.559
- Mrs Doctor!
- Really, just "Doctor" is fine.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.799
Polidori!

22:15.031 --> 22:17.300
He emerged from the wall like a phantom!

22:18.267 --> 22:19.559
Begone, demon!

22:23.440 --> 22:26.159
Pulse... check.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.399
Breathing... check.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.479
May I just say, you are quite
lovely in a crisis.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.120
No, you may not!

22:37.300 --> 22:39.020
The lights are on...

22:39.021 --> 22:40.959
...but he's gone on a mini-break.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.199
Possessed?

22:42.200 --> 22:44.879
Or asleep? He walks in his sleep.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.849
One does not sleepwalk through walls.

22:46.850 --> 22:49.439
Not just through, up.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.275
He was downstairs a second ago.

22:52.194 --> 22:53.554
What you said before...

22:53.555 --> 22:55.519
- About being lovely?
- Back a bit!

22:55.520 --> 22:57.320
Er... Demon?

22:59.508 --> 23:00.940
It's like dreaming...

23:02.080 --> 23:04.760
...only we aren't... and he is.

23:06.400 --> 23:10.840
So he can't see... the illusion.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.239
It's more than that.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.780
We're surrounded. Immersed.

23:19.780 --> 23:22.440
It's sort of like a perception filter.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.279
Close your eyes. Clear your mind.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.800
We're only experiencing what it
wants us to.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.460
I can feel it.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.799
She's right.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.620
Our minds are being deceived.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.940
Here is the door, hidden from our eyes.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.420
Elise?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.280
I'm coming for William.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.879
How are we here now?

23:54.880 --> 23:56.440
This is impossible.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.300
This should be William's room.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.079
This place keeps on changing,
like a puzzle.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.919
I don't get it.

24:04.686 --> 24:06.726
Why hide a house inside a house?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.020
William! My darling!

24:26.427 --> 24:28.467
I suspect I must have missed something.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.820
Yes, but you've shown us how to
get out of this room.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.461
This can't be the hallway.

24:34.462 --> 24:35.900
We've not descended the stairs.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.199
It is. But there should be a door here.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.719
Please can we get out of here?

24:43.720 --> 24:47.076
In theory, yes.
We just have to tell ourselves

24:47.077 --> 24:49.081
that we can walk through the door

24:49.082 --> 24:51.576
we know is right there...

24:55.220 --> 24:56.820
Ugh! Ooh!

24:58.592 --> 25:02.919
My bones have never caused
such mischief before, I swear.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.865
The things we know, we can
move inside, but not out.

25:06.866 --> 25:10.659
- Dead things don't act dead.
- People vanish. Elise?

25:10.660 --> 25:11.766
My poor William.

25:11.767 --> 25:13.479
There's no sign of Fletcher either.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.200
Hey, maybe Shelley didn't turn
up because he couldn't get in.

25:17.403 --> 25:20.956
I've never believed in such
things, but could this be Hell?

25:20.957 --> 25:24.473
- Could we be deceased?
- Nice blue-sky thinking, but no.

25:24.474 --> 25:27.079
This place keeps on folding in
on itself as well.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.000
Exactly.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.537
I think we're caught in
a security system. It's...

25:32.538 --> 25:36.174
It's turned the house into a
sort of giant panic room.

25:36.175 --> 25:37.920
In 1816?

25:40.240 --> 25:42.292
The Year Without a Summer.

25:42.293 --> 25:45.677
They blamed it on volcanic ash
covering the sunlight.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.169
Weather went haywire.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.879
What if something came here
that wasn't supposed to

25:49.880 --> 25:51.549
and caused a major disturbance?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.540
- Like what?
- That?

25:57.931 --> 26:00.560
That could be a solid option, Mary, yes.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.359
What is it?

26:03.360 --> 26:05.039
I don't know.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.662
It's sort of just floating around.

26:08.663 --> 26:11.302
Like a death god rising from Hades.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.675
Shelley's vision.

26:12.676 --> 26:14.062
But we're all having it.

26:14.063 --> 26:16.314
No. It's pushing through.

26:16.315 --> 26:17.890
That is what Shelley saw.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.999
It's not a vision. It never was.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.879
It's a traveller...

26:22.880 --> 26:25.120
...moving through time.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.080
And he's trying to get in.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.559
Are you the guardian?

26:43.560 --> 26:46.439
That is a lone Cyberman.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.559
Jack's warning,
beware of the lone Cyberman!

26:54.560 --> 26:56.806
- Don't let it have what it wants.
- At all costs!

26:56.807 --> 26:59.479
Yes, thank you! Barricade the door!

26:59.480 --> 27:02.759
May I ask, what is a Cyberman?

27:03.193 --> 27:04.396
Someone altered.

27:05.230 --> 27:08.439
Organs, flesh surgically
replaced with mechanical parts

27:08.440 --> 27:09.759
without consent.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.239
It drives them insane, so they
alter the brain too,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.653
- switch off all emotion.
- Are you the guardian?

27:14.654 --> 27:17.439
Never seen one like him before.
He's different.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.919
- Unfinished.
- Are you the guardian?

27:20.920 --> 27:22.858
Whatever he came for

27:22.859 --> 27:26.256
is hidden here.
It explains the security.

27:26.257 --> 27:28.604
- What's hidden?
- I've no idea,

27:28.605 --> 27:31.067
but I need to beat him to it. Quick.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.680
Lord Byron?

27:42.386 --> 27:45.297
Doctor, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

27:45.298 --> 27:46.736
You're not leaving us?

27:46.737 --> 27:48.719
I have to find out what
he's looking for.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.117
Alone.

27:50.118 --> 27:52.816
You need backup. All of us against one.

27:52.817 --> 27:55.438
One Cyberman, but then thousands.

27:55.439 --> 28:00.759
Humans like all of you changed
into empty, soulless shells.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.039
No feeling, no control, no way back.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.706
I will not lose anyone else to that!

28:07.412 --> 28:08.939
Do not follow me.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.240
Lord Byron?

28:17.856 --> 28:19.050
Is that you?

28:20.273 --> 28:22.319
I fear I've lost my faculties entirely.

28:25.221 --> 28:28.199
- Are you the guardian?
- No, sir.

28:28.675 --> 28:30.572
I am the valet.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.300
<i>Notre Père qui es aux cieux!</i>

29:09.067 --> 29:10.879
<i>Que ton nom soit sanctifié,</i>

29:12.560 --> 29:14.433
<i>Que ton règne vienne,</i>

29:14.434 --> 29:17.900
<i>Que ta volonté soit faite
sur la terre comme au ciel.</i>

29:42.600 --> 29:44.480
Don't be afraid, little one.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.272
You will be like us.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.279
- What if it finds William?
- We need to find the child.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.696
- And a way out.
- We are not safe here.

29:55.282 --> 29:57.362
He could pass through a wall
at any moment.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.978
The Doctor told us to wait.

29:58.979 --> 30:03.100
Technically, she only told us
not to follow her.

30:05.427 --> 30:06.500
Let's split up.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.860
Tell me what you're after.
I might be able to help.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.109
Well, it was never going to be
under there...

30:20.110 --> 30:22.399
...unless you don't actually
know what it looks like.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.980
Funny...

30:24.640 --> 30:27.439
This dark age is surprising.

30:27.894 --> 30:30.199
You're not as primitive as I expected.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.382
You're not as cyborg-y as I expected.

30:37.286 --> 30:39.286
You've met my kind before?

30:40.400 --> 30:43.519
- You could say that.
- You appear courageous,

30:43.520 --> 30:47.803
but your vital signs betray
a heightened state of anxiety.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.020
Or as I like to call it, Tuesday.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.611
Interesting look.

30:51.612 --> 30:53.799
What happened? They get bored
halfway through, or something?

30:53.800 --> 30:57.319
I'm complete enough to serve my purpose.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.831
Oh.

31:02.439 --> 31:03.679
Bit embarrassing.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.879
Time hop took a lot of juice.
Now you're fresh out.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.199
You irritate me.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.079
How very human. Still feel things, then?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.599
No inhibitor yet.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.553
I do not need to be stabilised!

31:15.554 --> 31:19.519
OK. Here's the thing. There's a
change I might be the guardian,

31:19.520 --> 31:21.759
only I don't know what it is
I'm supposed to be guarding.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.159
This isn't my time either.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.479
Maybe we're supposed to work together.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.403
- Together?
- Anything's possible.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.580
The house still shifts.

31:37.090 --> 31:39.479
- Whose room is this?
- No-one's.

31:40.178 --> 31:41.283
I thought it was empty.

31:41.284 --> 31:44.121
But the writing on the walls and all
of these papers?

31:44.122 --> 31:46.580
The writing... It's Shelley's.

31:52.897 --> 31:55.159
The cellar. We'll give it a miss, eh?

31:55.160 --> 31:57.300
Could the coal hatch be
a means of escape?

31:58.235 --> 31:59.639
We should try everywhere.

32:00.228 --> 32:02.039
Is it too late to choose another group?

32:14.520 --> 32:17.119
Ooh! You ever considered breath mints?

32:17.120 --> 32:19.160
Recharging? Not good.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.919
Figuring out how to
manipulate the elements

32:23.920 --> 32:26.805
and creating an extreme sophisticated

32:26.806 --> 32:30.080
and probably unlimited external
power source.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.600
That's better!

32:44.204 --> 32:45.757
The coal hatch has gone.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.880
There's no way out.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.806
Claire, you OK?

32:58.807 --> 32:59.994
Miss Clairmont?

33:00.814 --> 33:03.180
There's something down here with us.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.555
I can read the energy field now.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.840
You are not the guardian.

33:10.680 --> 33:14.260
The Cyberium has selected
another as host too.

33:14.803 --> 33:16.279
What's a Cyberium?

33:16.280 --> 33:19.639
I'll find it and remove it.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.239
What are we talking here?

33:21.240 --> 33:24.679
A life form? A weapon of some kind?

33:24.680 --> 33:25.940
Both...

33:28.786 --> 33:30.182
What's happening to you?

33:34.440 --> 33:38.200
"There's not one atom of yon Earth...

33:40.686 --> 33:43.399
...but once was living man."

33:47.160 --> 33:50.039
"The sword that stabs his peace..."

33:50.040 --> 33:51.919
"...He cherisheth

33:51.920 --> 33:53.959
the snakes that gnaw his heart

33:53.960 --> 33:57.639
and he raises up the tyrant
whose delight..."

33:57.640 --> 34:00.319
"...Is in his woe."

34:01.640 --> 34:03.319
Shelley's words.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.642
How does it know them?

34:04.643 --> 34:08.719
Something crept in front of me.
I heard its vile breath.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.399
Listen...

34:26.000 --> 34:28.639
I'm sorry, but I tried to hide it.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.629
I have to keep him out.

34:32.181 --> 34:33.219
Who are you?

34:34.139 --> 34:35.480
I'm the guardian.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.478
I am...

34:38.480 --> 34:40.475
...Percy Bysshe Shelley.

34:41.400 --> 34:45.460
He is whom I seek.

34:46.199 --> 34:49.119
But he is fortified against me!

34:49.120 --> 34:52.039
OK. Good to know. So I vote we split up

34:52.040 --> 34:55.320
and continue the search.
You go this way, and I'll go...

35:08.240 --> 35:11.169
- Doctor, you're here!
- Come on, then.

35:12.269 --> 35:14.318
Oh... William!

35:21.226 --> 35:24.183
Dear Fletcher, no. It cannot be.

35:26.806 --> 35:28.959
Mr O'Brien needs you
in the cellar at once.

35:29.533 --> 35:30.919
We found Shelley.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.029
All of you, find somewhere to hide.

35:34.030 --> 35:35.341
- But I...
- Do you want to listen,

35:35.342 --> 35:36.919
or do you want to end up like them?

35:36.920 --> 35:39.159
None of this is supposed to happen.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.404
They weren't supposed to die,
neither are you,

35:41.405 --> 35:43.919
so, please, let's not unravel
anything else.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.980
Hide, and stay there.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.759
History is vulnerable tonight.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.141
I mean it.

35:50.142 --> 35:51.780
Now go on.

35:55.607 --> 35:57.540
You're going to take William for me.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.960
Guard him well.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.079
Stay safe.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.760
I need to see Percy.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.656
Shelley in a cellar,

36:10.657 --> 36:14.399
hidden away, cloaked,
too big to register.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.220
That's why my readings have been off.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.440
It's something called a Cyberium.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.080
I'm trying to protect it.

36:25.834 --> 36:27.456
Be gone, invader!

36:41.556 --> 36:43.048
Who moved him?

36:43.049 --> 36:44.892
Is it you? Changing the house?

36:44.893 --> 36:47.146
Some, but not all.

36:48.093 --> 36:49.541
It has its own room.

36:50.168 --> 36:52.571
- Mary!
- I cannot hide.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.480
Not while he suffers.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.559
Show me.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.280
What happened to you?

37:06.100 --> 37:07.680
I was out walking alone.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.440
There was a glimmer in the lake.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.160
Exquisite.

37:13.693 --> 37:14.813
Alive.

37:15.377 --> 37:16.817
Like quicksilver.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.000
I fished it out to study it
more closely.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.540
But then it took root within me.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.479
I returned...

37:39.480 --> 37:40.519
Hello!

37:40.520 --> 37:42.140
I was changed.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.319
No-one could see me.

37:48.320 --> 37:52.175
It hid itself in me, and hid me
within the villa.

37:52.176 --> 37:54.185
And when it thought
it might be discovered,

37:54.186 --> 37:56.439
in manipulated all of our perceptions.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.742
Since the quicksilver
has taken hold of me,

37:58.743 --> 38:01.734
I see symbols. Symbols and numbers.

38:01.735 --> 38:03.567
They will not leave my head,

38:03.568 --> 38:05.319
no matter how much I transcribe them.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.595
The symbols were all over his room.

38:07.596 --> 38:08.860
All over the walls.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.540
The house was like shifting sands.

38:14.160 --> 38:18.059
I sought solitude here, in the dark.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.479
- What happened to him?
- I'm going with...

38:20.480 --> 38:23.426
- ...alien parasite.
- Cyber technology.

38:23.427 --> 38:26.145
The knowledge of the whole
cyber race and AI

38:26.146 --> 38:27.519
from the future,

38:27.520 --> 38:31.399
containing the knowledge and
future history of all Cybermen.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.945
They scorched and split the sky.

38:33.946 --> 38:35.839
Built the army of all armies.

38:35.840 --> 38:41.051
Left behind only pain, rage,
fear and death.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.559
How is he seeing all this?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.559
The Cyberium is burning through
his mind.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.742
It'll destroy him
if it stays in him much longer.

38:47.235 --> 38:50.638
An epic battle. The Cyberium at
the heart of it,

38:50.639 --> 38:53.619
controlling data,
strategy, decision-making.

38:53.620 --> 38:54.799
Clever!

38:54.800 --> 38:56.999
Very clever. Someone took it
from the Cybermen,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.519
sent it back through time here

38:58.520 --> 39:00.580
in an attempt to change the future.

39:03.154 --> 39:05.460
In an attempt to protect you from that.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.360
I can't keep him away much longer.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.880
Then don't.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.819
- Doc!
- Stop fighting.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.708
- It's OK.
- Jack's warning!

39:16.709 --> 39:18.549
Jack isn't here now,
stuck in a house with that.

39:18.550 --> 39:20.448
Exactly. You didn't want us
near it a minute ago.

39:20.449 --> 39:21.579
I've just been inside his brain.

39:21.580 --> 39:24.523
There's a super-computer fused
to a cerebral cortex.

39:24.524 --> 39:26.639
He's the only one who knows how
to get that out!

39:26.640 --> 39:28.639
Don't let the Cyberman have
what it wants.

39:28.640 --> 39:32.157
I know, because armies will
rise and billions will die.

39:32.158 --> 39:34.270
Shelley's going to die if that
stuff stays inside him.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.680
Shelley's only one life against
all those others.

39:38.507 --> 39:39.740
What are you saying?

39:40.440 --> 39:43.260
How can you condemn him
to death like that?

39:44.267 --> 39:45.347
But is he, Ryan?

39:45.920 --> 39:49.712
His thoughts, his words inspire
and influence thousands

39:49.713 --> 39:52.225
for centuries. If he dies now,

39:52.226 --> 39:55.120
who knows what damage that will
have on future history?

39:57.197 --> 39:59.060
Words matter!

40:01.420 --> 40:06.800
One death, one ripple, and
history will change in a blink.

40:06.801 --> 40:08.399
The future will not be
the world you know.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.797
The world you came from,
the world you were created in

40:11.798 --> 40:14.340
won't exist, so neither will you.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.340
It's not just his life at stake.
It's yours.

40:19.027 --> 40:20.821
You want to sacrifice yourself for this?

40:20.822 --> 40:22.555
You want me to sacrifice you?

40:23.162 --> 40:24.775
You want to call it? Do it now.

40:24.776 --> 40:25.940
All of you.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.381
Yeah.

40:35.221 --> 40:38.508
Cos sometimes
this team structure isn't flat.

40:38.509 --> 40:40.799
It's mountainous, with me at the summit

40:40.800 --> 40:43.155
in the stratosphere. Alone.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.100
Left to choose.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.440
Save the poet, save the universe.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.819
Watch people burn now or tomorrow.

40:53.820 --> 40:56.280
Sometimes, even I can't win.

41:02.849 --> 41:03.959
Please...

41:03.960 --> 41:05.420
...help me.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.879
Release what you hold.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.234
- How?
- Release it!

41:15.235 --> 41:16.639
He doesn't know what that means!

41:16.640 --> 41:17.983
You've got to tell him what
he's got to do!

41:17.984 --> 41:20.734
I am addressing the Cyberium.

41:20.735 --> 41:23.887
It must execute the host
to be extracted.

41:23.888 --> 41:25.399
It's not obeying you.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.150
Hmm.

41:27.151 --> 41:30.559
Then I shall execute the host.

41:30.560 --> 41:33.126
What is your name, sir?

41:33.127 --> 41:35.519
Mary, this is not a good time to talk.

41:35.520 --> 41:38.599
Or names. Are you several men?

41:38.600 --> 41:40.639
A composite of parts.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.629
I am better than men!

41:43.630 --> 41:46.288
Yet I still see a soul in there.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.180
What do you think you see, child?

41:51.860 --> 41:55.080
I see the man who spared my son.

42:00.260 --> 42:02.560
Were you a father? Before?

42:04.420 --> 42:06.560
I was.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.999
You didn't want to be this way.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.720
They hurt you, this modern Prometheus.

42:15.170 --> 42:16.879
You loved once.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.040
And were loved in return.

42:22.653 --> 42:24.280
You do not wish to kill.

42:31.274 --> 42:35.940
My name was Ashad.

42:39.811 --> 42:42.319
I did spare your son...

42:43.480 --> 42:46.559
...because he's a useless runt,

42:46.560 --> 42:48.839
sickly and weak.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.959
And I did have children.

42:50.960 --> 42:55.319
I slit their throats when they
joined the resistance.

42:55.320 --> 42:59.119
In death we are transformed,

42:59.120 --> 43:03.879
improved, updated, as you will learn!

43:03.880 --> 43:05.329
Transformed in death.

43:05.330 --> 43:08.920
I'm sorry, Percy Shelley. So very sorry.

43:10.360 --> 43:13.320
Mrs Doctor, what are you doing to him?

43:15.920 --> 43:17.720
Doctor...

43:22.840 --> 43:24.960
The Cyberium! It's leaving his body!

43:27.800 --> 43:29.754
What just happened?

43:29.755 --> 43:32.119
- How are we back here?
- He's reset the house

43:32.120 --> 43:33.829
Shelley needs help!

43:33.830 --> 43:35.592
I think I've freed him from
the Cyberium!

43:35.593 --> 43:38.240
At what cost?

43:41.674 --> 43:43.500
No!

43:44.120 --> 43:45.979
And it chooses me.

43:45.980 --> 43:47.785
Interesting.

43:47.786 --> 43:49.531
Time Lord magnetism.

43:49.532 --> 43:51.460
Looks like I'm the true guardian.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.737
Surrender it or I will execute you.

43:57.738 --> 44:00.379
I'd be very careful with those
execution threats.

44:00.380 --> 44:03.211
I can feel it already, fusing to me.

44:03.212 --> 44:04.519
It feels very at home.

44:05.056 --> 44:07.879
Recognising great host material.
Not to big myself up,

44:07.880 --> 44:09.999
but I don't think it'll vacate
me without a fight.

44:17.932 --> 44:20.159
What are you doing? Transmitting.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.759
My ship will lock on to my signal.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.316
It will tear this reality,

44:25.317 --> 44:29.248
and this planet will remain
only in shreds!

44:29.249 --> 44:31.820
This world doesn't end in 1816.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.519
- It can't.
- It will.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.879
He's bluffing. Don't listen to him.

44:37.466 --> 44:41.133
But I can't be sure.
I can't risk this planet!

44:41.134 --> 44:44.320
- I can't win!
- We are inevitable.

44:48.900 --> 44:50.000
Yes.

44:51.040 --> 44:52.280
You are.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.399
What are you doing?

44:57.400 --> 44:58.920
Giving it what it wants.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.112
What did you do to Shelley?

45:16.113 --> 45:17.839
Old Time Lord trick. Not a nice one.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.951
Pushed his mind to his future death,

45:19.952 --> 45:21.839
tricked the Cyberium into letting go,

45:21.840 --> 45:23.835
hoped his body would survive the trauma.

45:23.836 --> 45:26.159
I'm sorry. I hope you can forgive me.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.802
You saved Shelley, but what
does that mean for the future?

45:28.803 --> 45:30.462
It means I've put it in
the gravest danger.

45:30.463 --> 45:32.719
Please tell me that
was part of the plan.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.719
Yes. A last-minute,
imperfect, all-I've-got plan.

45:35.720 --> 45:38.484
Saving Shelley was step one.

45:38.485 --> 45:41.631
- What's step two?
- Fix the mess I created in step one.

45:46.137 --> 45:48.439
Go to the future, find him

45:48.440 --> 45:52.359
and stop him from rebuilding
the Cyber Army.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.039
Shelley, can you give Yaz those
symbols and numbers?

45:55.736 --> 45:57.440
We're going to need them.

46:02.533 --> 46:05.159
Well, that was quite the evening.

46:05.639 --> 46:07.079
Indeed.

46:08.453 --> 46:10.720
Perhaps Miss Clairmont would
care to retire?

46:12.866 --> 46:15.746
A lie-down could prove restorative.

46:17.374 --> 46:20.600
You pursued Mrs Doctor without
a care for my presence...

46:21.480 --> 46:23.600
...belittled my thoughts and opinions...

46:24.880 --> 46:27.680
...and then proceeded to use my
person as a human shield.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.360
And...?

46:31.960 --> 46:34.640
And the spell is broken, my lord.

46:47.340 --> 46:49.080
You have returned me to life,

46:49.560 --> 46:52.420
although I feel as though
I have none of it left to live.

46:53.436 --> 46:54.839
Sorry about the sneak peek.

46:55.336 --> 46:57.220
Every moment will be precious.

46:59.122 --> 47:00.562
How can we repay you?

47:00.563 --> 47:02.079
Just don't lose hope.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.999
Yeah. Keep doing that writing thing.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.080
If you like.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.359
So, if all the weirdness was
the Cyberium, you know,

47:15.360 --> 47:17.839
the bones and Shelley floating
about and all that,

47:17.840 --> 47:19.766
why would it reanimate
a couple of stiffs

47:19.767 --> 47:21.227
just to bring me a sarnie?

47:21.781 --> 47:24.079
You know, the maid
and the creepy little kid?

47:24.080 --> 47:25.920
Er... no.

47:27.410 --> 47:29.160
We thought you saw Shelley, like we did.

47:30.211 --> 47:33.279
Oh, come on! Beady eyes?
Made the room go all arctic?

47:33.280 --> 47:35.599
- Where do them two fit in?
- I'm not sure they did.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.519
No, come on, Doc. This is where you
jump in with a rational explanation.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.557
I mean, ghosts don't exist, right?

47:40.558 --> 47:42.557
- Unless they do.
- What?!

47:43.778 --> 47:45.199
Inside, you three.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.345
We need to talk.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.679
Listen...

47:49.680 --> 47:51.743
You don't need to come with me.

47:52.580 --> 47:54.880
Cyber war zones and people don't mix.

47:56.220 --> 47:57.650
I'll drop you back in 2020.

47:57.651 --> 47:59.196
Or we can use Shelley's numbers.

48:00.046 --> 48:01.606
Co-ordinates, right?

48:05.730 --> 48:08.508
Yeah. Wherever you think's
a good place to start.

48:08.509 --> 48:09.760
With step two.

48:11.561 --> 48:13.119
"The world was void

48:13.120 --> 48:15.916
The populous and the powerful was a lump

48:15.917 --> 48:19.115
Seasonless, herbless, treeless

48:19.116 --> 48:21.378
Manless, lifeless

48:21.379 --> 48:22.837
A lump of death

48:22.838 --> 48:25.680
A chaos of hard clay

48:25.681 --> 48:29.494
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea

48:29.495 --> 48:32.719
And their masts fell down piecemeal

48:32.720 --> 48:34.399
As they dropped

48:34.400 --> 48:37.719
They slept on the abyss without a surge

48:37.720 --> 48:39.839
The waves were dead

48:39.840 --> 48:42.879
The tides were in their grave

48:42.880 --> 48:44.879
The moon, their mistress

48:44.880 --> 48:46.674
Had expired before

48:47.268 --> 48:49.639
The winds were withered in
the stagnant air

48:49.640 --> 48:51.652
And the clouds perished

48:53.559 --> 48:56.279
Darkness had no need of aid for them

48:58.444 --> 49:00.279
She was the universe."

this planet, this time period,

in the very far future,

49:40.826 --> 49:43.060
immediate aftermath of the Cyber-Wars?
