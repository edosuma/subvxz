00:05.839 --> 00:09.143
[*****]

00:10.844 --> 00:14.682
[*****]

00:14.815 --> 00:16.617
So this box
still needs to be labeled.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.885
And then
these will be wrapped

00:18.018 --> 00:19.453
as a series of three.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.623
Oh! No, no, no. No.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.058
That piece stays here.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.293
It's just the Michaud
and the Vasquez

00:25.426 --> 00:26.427
that need packing.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.661
And please wrap them tight.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.463
No wiggle room. Okay?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.199
[phone rings]

00:31.332 --> 00:32.466
Hey, it's me.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.301
Hey, Liv.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.668
Just calling to check in

00:34.802 --> 00:36.237
to make sure
everything's on schedule?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.405
As long as
the carrier's not late,

00:37.538 --> 00:38.872
I will be on the plane by 3:00

00:39.006 --> 00:40.141
and back in time
for Thai night.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.142
Great, because
I have some news.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.476
What is it?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.145
I'll tell you
when you get here.

00:44.278 --> 00:44.512
I've got to go,
but I will see you at home.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.484
You can't leave me
hanging like that.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.685
Amber.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.988
All right, we can't be late,

00:55.123 --> 00:56.490
so let's get these
on the truck.

01:00.261 --> 01:05.199
[*****]

01:13.807 --> 01:15.309
Hey!

01:19.813 --> 01:22.515
[*****]

01:35.729 --> 01:37.465
Amber, I'm home.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.899
[Amber] I'll be right out.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.334
Sorry if the food got cold.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.436
My flight got delayed.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.039
By the way,
I officially hate my job.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.511
You hated it before you left.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.314
This last tour confirmed it.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.749
I'm essentially a UPS service
for the gallery.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.686
Hey, maybe that's
what I should do.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.421
Deliver mail
here in the neighborhood.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.789
Then I wouldn't have to

02:01.922 --> 02:03.357
miss out on my latte
from Jumpstart

02:03.491 --> 02:05.058
or my best friend
in the whole world.

02:05.193 --> 02:08.396
Or you could work on
your art.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.899
I don't want
to talk about that.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.267
What I do want to talk about
is your news.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.535
[knocking on door]

02:14.668 --> 02:16.170
Hold that thought.
It's open.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.871
Why? Is that Justin?

02:18.005 --> 02:19.307
He'd better not
know this news before me.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.277
-Hey!
-Hey.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.918
Liv, you remember
Dylan, right?

02:31.051 --> 02:33.254
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.788
You two were, like,
hanging out before I left.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.090
Yeah, yeah.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.759
It's good
to see you again, Olivia.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.328
And, ooh, I see the food
has arrived.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.163
Dylan's been joining me
for Thai night

02:43.297 --> 02:44.465
while you've been away.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.767
Oh.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.302
That's great.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.605
You haven't told her?

02:51.739 --> 02:52.773
Told me what?

02:52.906 --> 02:54.942
Um...

02:55.075 --> 02:56.744
As you may recall,

02:56.877 --> 02:57.911
Dylan's been in New York

02:58.045 --> 02:59.680
sourcing some new
equipment suppliers,

02:59.813 --> 03:01.649
but now he has to go back
to his ranch in Wyoming,

03:01.782 --> 03:03.317
and...

03:04.117 --> 03:05.219
he asked me to go with him!

03:05.353 --> 03:06.520
Is that?

03:06.654 --> 03:07.421
Are you?

03:09.223 --> 03:10.123
We are.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.525
[both] We're engaged!

03:18.266 --> 03:20.133
Hi. Excuse me.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.669
Dylan.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.203
Dylan? Hi.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.839
Do you mind just giving us
several moments alone, please?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.908
Yeah. Yeah.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.043
Babe, I'll go
for a walk around the block.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.545
Thank you.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.082
[shrieks in glee]

03:36.116 --> 03:39.119
Amber, you two met,
like, four weeks ago.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.821
Six.

03:40.954 --> 03:41.822
Okay, and, you know,

03:41.954 --> 03:43.156
it was all casual

03:43.291 --> 03:44.692
because he wasn't staying,
and...

03:44.825 --> 03:46.293
Then I go away
for three weeks,

03:46.427 --> 03:48.662
and I come back
and you're engaged.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.331
I didn't plan on falling
head over heels for him,

03:50.464 --> 03:51.332
but I did,

03:51.465 --> 03:53.434
and honestly?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
This is the most excited
I've been

03:54.968 --> 03:55.869
in, like, forever.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.906
So please, please
be happy for me.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.075
Of course,
I'm happy for you.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.076
Come here.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.646
Thank you.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.822
[*****]

04:15.989 --> 04:17.558
You totally got that.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.892
I know.
I totally did.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.796
You are
so not happy for her.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.864
Well, of course not.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.265
But what can I say?

04:25.399 --> 04:26.534
She asked me to be
her maid of honor.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.035
Well, you two
are like sisters.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.337
Exactly.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.471
Sisters don't just
spring it on you

04:30.604 --> 04:31.905
that they're getting married

04:32.039 --> 04:33.541
and moving away
to go live on a ranch.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.810
Plus, we're city girls.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.778
This is what we do.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.779
We hang out here,

04:38.912 --> 04:40.047
we go to yoga,

04:40.180 --> 04:41.549
we get coffee and takeout,

04:41.682 --> 04:43.150
and we talk about

04:43.283 --> 04:44.452
all the amazing things
we're going to do one day.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.058
Well, as unhappy as you are,

04:52.192 --> 04:54.094
you still have to plan
a bachelorette party.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.796
So...

04:55.929 --> 04:57.097
what about, like,
a Western theme?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.499
Seriously?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.267
If Amber wants
to go live on a ranch,

05:00.401 --> 05:01.735
she needs to know

05:01.869 --> 05:03.303
it's not going to be
all cute boots and hats.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.538
I mean, they have
black widow spiders

05:04.672 --> 05:06.340
that live in Wyoming.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.342
That girl can't handle
anything creepy-crawly,

05:08.476 --> 05:10.878
so how's that
for a reality check?

05:13.213 --> 05:14.782
Oh, my gosh.
That's it.

05:14.915 --> 05:15.949
What?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.885
As maid of honor,

05:18.018 --> 05:19.620
I am in charge
of planning a sendoff,

05:19.753 --> 05:23.591
so I am going to plan
not just a party

05:23.724 --> 05:25.926
but a surprise
bachelorette getaway.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.464
One that will show Amber
what a big mistake she's making.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.805
Thank you so much.

05:37.938 --> 05:38.972
You're welcome.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.478
Okay, Liv.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.746
We're at the airport.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.080
Are you finally
going to tell us

05:47.214 --> 05:48.782
where the surprise trip is?

05:48.916 --> 05:51.419
Check your phones.
I just sent the itineraries.

05:52.953 --> 05:53.821
Dude ranch?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.188
That's right.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.790
Surprise.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.527
Is this not the most epic
bachelorette getaway ever?

05:59.659 --> 06:00.828
Because seriously,

06:00.961 --> 06:01.762
dude ranches
are hot right now.

06:01.895 --> 06:02.963
Oh.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.231
It is busy season,

06:04.364 --> 06:05.833
but lucky for us,

06:05.966 --> 06:07.134
they just opened their doors
to the public.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.368
Sure, but, I mean,

06:08.502 --> 06:09.570
you could have
at least told me

06:09.703 --> 06:11.238
so I didn't pack
all of my heels.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.641
Sorry, but you're going
to have to get used to that.

06:13.774 --> 06:14.808
Seeing as you won't need
all your cute heels

06:14.942 --> 06:15.776
once you live in the country.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.278
But I'm sure we can get you
some boots on the way.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.312
Oh.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.914
I just Googled,

06:21.048 --> 06:22.650
and Yellowstone Airport
has a Western boutique.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.817
They've got cowboy hats.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.718
Ooh.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.420
Ooh, they even have spurs.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.522
See? We're all set.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.857
All right, let's giddy-up.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.631
[*****]

06:52.680 --> 06:57.150
[*****]

07:02.756 --> 07:07.160
[*****]

07:15.335 --> 07:18.739
[*****]

07:24.244 --> 07:25.879
Oh, my gosh.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.750
This dude ranch is amazing.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.461
[*****]

07:42.530 --> 07:43.697
Welcome to Big Sky.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.065
I'm Wade McCleary.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.967
Nice to meet you,
Mr. McCleary.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.235
I'm Olivia,

07:48.368 --> 07:49.803
and these are my friends,
Amber and Justin.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.805
It's a pleasure,

07:51.939 --> 07:52.840
and please, call me Wade.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.143
I've brewed up
some fresh iced tea.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.945
Okay.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.884
[*****]

08:12.225 --> 08:13.961
Mm, mm, mm.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.829
Now, doesn't that taste
just like a country day?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.498
Oh, there's my boy now.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.103
[*****]

08:23.236 --> 08:24.171
What?

08:26.306 --> 08:27.507
Thanks.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.077
Travis, our guests
have arrived.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.280
This here is Olivia,
Amber, and Justin.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.683
Nice to meet y'all.

08:38.150 --> 08:41.288
These folks came
all the way from...

08:41.421 --> 08:42.289
Where is it you came from?

08:42.422 --> 08:43.991
New York City.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.092
The Big Apple.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.495
So...

08:48.629 --> 08:50.130
any of you ever live

08:50.263 --> 08:51.364
or work
out in the country before?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.233
Oh, heck no,

08:53.366 --> 08:55.268
but Amber here

08:55.402 --> 08:58.706
is getting married
and moving to a ranch.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.874
Probably just like this one.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.176
So no experience, then,

09:03.310 --> 09:05.245
riding horses
or handling cattle?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.680
Let's put it this way.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.148
The only experience we have

09:08.281 --> 09:09.617
is dressing up

09:09.750 --> 09:11.018
for the pub's Western-themed
Halloween party.

09:13.954 --> 09:14.788
Are those
the clothes you wore?

09:14.922 --> 09:17.591
Oh, is this not...

09:17.725 --> 09:19.492
I think
we've got the picture

09:19.627 --> 09:21.228
that these here folks

09:21.361 --> 09:23.897
are in for a new
and exciting adventure.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.267
And seeing as
you're our very first guests,

09:27.400 --> 09:28.335
so are we.

09:28.468 --> 09:29.870
Am I right, Travis?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.172
Yeah, actually,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.074
I have been
horseback riding before.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.442
I took lessons.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.610
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.078
When?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.780
Those two summers
I went to Camp Washonagin

09:39.913 --> 09:41.148
when you were
in summer school.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.182
Well, that's something.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.751
Right, Travis?

09:43.884 --> 09:44.985
I guess so.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.987
Now, how about

09:47.120 --> 09:48.856
you graciously
show our guests

09:48.989 --> 09:50.190
to their lodgings?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.358
Of course.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.893
Follow me.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.063
Okay.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.939
Here you are.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.376
Ooh, rustic chic.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.011
I like it.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.684
Are these handmade?

10:17.685 --> 10:19.452
Yeah, by my mom
and grandmother.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.754
Authentic.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.922
That is exactly
what we want.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.658
All right.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.728
Well, you've got
a few amenities.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.664
Radio, coffee maker...

10:30.798 --> 10:32.399
And the ladies' room
would be...

10:32.532 --> 10:33.466
That door right there.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.135
Ah. Phew.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.137
I was a bit worried
we might have an outhouse.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.973
We're not totally
in the Dark Ages,

10:40.107 --> 10:42.275
but since you're asking,
the shower is outdoors.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.744
But don't worry.
It's completely private.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.378
Yeah, and Wi-Fi?

10:45.512 --> 10:48.882
Because I have to get
in touch with my fiancé.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.452
Oh, my gosh, fiancé.
It sounds so weird.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.754
Well, it kind of is.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.224
She got engaged in,
like, four weeks.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.892
Six... weeks, actually.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.863
Now I'll leave y'all
to get settled.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.297
But dinner should
be ready shortly.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.466
You'll be notified
by the dinner bell.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.668
So unless there's
anything else I missed...

11:09.569 --> 11:11.171
Well, how about a tour?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.273
You know, of the ranch,

11:13.406 --> 11:14.742
so we can get
a lay of the land.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.410
Oh, sure.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.979
Yeah, I'm going to have
to take a rain check

11:19.112 --> 11:21.281
on that until
after I call Dylan.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.449
I'm out, too.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.884
I've got to put my feet up

11:24.017 --> 11:25.252
after wearing
these bad boys all day.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.989
I guess it's just
me and you, cowboy.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.390
Sorry.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.925
Is that politically
not correct, or...

11:33.093 --> 11:34.828
I'll meet you
out by the corral.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.230
Yes, sir.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.500
Is it just me,
or is he a bit rough?

11:40.633 --> 11:43.070
If you mean prickly
as a cactus out here,

11:43.203 --> 11:44.271
then yeah.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.109
Citiots.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.283
I'm guessing
this is the corral.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.122
Hey there.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.227
You're pretty as a picture
with those big old soft eyes.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.764
That's it.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.365
You want to take
a picture with me?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.534
[shutter clicking]

12:14.667 --> 12:16.036
Wait, I don't see you.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.138
Here, I'll just move
this way a little bit.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.074
[low mooing]

12:21.208 --> 12:22.175
Whoa!

12:24.912 --> 12:25.879
Oh...

12:30.050 --> 12:30.918
Need a hand?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.986
Yeah. Thanks.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.164
That's good.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.467
So I guess you figured out

12:47.600 --> 12:50.203
here's where we keep the cows
and Cyclone the bull.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.404
Cyclone?

12:51.538 --> 12:53.874
Because he can be a bit...

12:54.007 --> 12:54.842
unpredictable.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.910
Right.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.880
So are these
all the cows you have?

13:00.013 --> 13:01.982
Most are out to pasture.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.185
Then what else
other than the corral?

13:06.453 --> 13:09.322
Well, we keep the horses
in the barn over there.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.058
Hen coops
are just in behind it.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.793
And we keep the pigs
over in that barn.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.262
So...

13:15.395 --> 13:17.630
other than
10,000 acres of land,

13:17.764 --> 13:19.532
this here's about it.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.970
So we're
your first guests, huh?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.838
That's right.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.074
My dad put the ranch up on...

13:27.207 --> 13:28.942
Trippy? Or Tripster?

13:29.076 --> 13:29.943
TripAdvisor?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.579
Sure. Whatever.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.781
I can see that
this whole hospitality thing

13:34.915 --> 13:36.083
is kind of new to you.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.450
[dinner bell clanging]

13:41.054 --> 13:42.489
Ha. Saved by the dinner bell.

13:43.957 --> 13:47.460
Well, thank you
for pointing everything out,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.429
and I guess
I will see you at dinner.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.464
Which is...

13:51.598 --> 13:54.067
Outside the farmhouse.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.903
I'll see y'all there.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.147
Thank you.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.155
Wow, those were
some serious steaks.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.458
I guess I should have asked
if any of you are vegetarian.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.626
None here.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.028
Good thing,

14:21.161 --> 14:22.495
because out here,

14:22.629 --> 14:25.798
we fuel up
on meat, meat, and more meat.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.168
Keeps us going
from dawn till dusk.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.437
And speaking
of days on the ranch,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.572
is that what
one should expect

14:32.705 --> 14:34.174
living like this?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.976
I mean, getting up at dawn

14:36.109 --> 14:38.645
and working on chores
all day until dusk?

14:38.778 --> 14:40.813
Well, that's about right,
wouldn't you say, Travis?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.415
Pretty much.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.883
Wow.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.685
So I guess vacations
are out of the question.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.721
Like my grandpa used to say,

14:48.855 --> 14:50.157
"If you want to be a rancher,

14:50.290 --> 14:51.391
you've got to stay home
and do the work."

14:52.459 --> 14:53.593
Wow.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.694
Sounds tough.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.329
Definitely a way of life.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.199
So what's on the itinerary?

14:59.332 --> 15:02.069
I mean, we are celebrating
a soon-to-be bride.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.671
Maybe some games
or some trail riding?

15:04.804 --> 15:05.838
Do you have a pool?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.907
Uh, no.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.009
No pool.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.078
But we do have a river

15:11.211 --> 15:12.545
that runs through
our property.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.515
I'm sure we could plan
an outing out there

15:15.648 --> 15:16.984
if we all manage

15:17.117 --> 15:19.319
to finish what needs
to get done around here.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.454
Wait.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.990
Is this another
bachelorette surprise?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.458
I'm actually talking
about chores.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.960
Huh?

15:27.094 --> 15:29.529
Because y'all booked
a working dude ranch.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.231
You know that, right?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.266
Working?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.601
What does that mean, exactly?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.236
Well, it means fun.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.505
Getting your hands dirty,
your boots scuffed up.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.474
So you're saying

15:41.608 --> 15:45.145
we're actually
working the ranch?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.714
That is the experience
you signed up for

15:47.847 --> 15:50.217
on a "working" dude ranch.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.185
Partaking in all the things

15:52.319 --> 15:53.520
that make a place like this

15:53.653 --> 15:55.722
run as smooth
as a cattle drive.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.590
Did I not tell you guys

15:57.724 --> 15:59.226
that this is
a working dude ranch?

15:59.359 --> 16:00.093
No.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.528
No, you did not.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.897
Then, in that case,
Amber's right.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.399
It is another surprise.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.567
Don't worry.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.901
I'm sure you'll find
your stay here

16:09.036 --> 16:10.737
will be more than memorable.

16:10.870 --> 16:11.738
Right, Travis?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.540
No doubt.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.208
I mean, what better way

16:15.342 --> 16:16.443
than to get our bride-to-be
ready for her new life?

16:16.576 --> 16:17.444
Am I right?

16:17.577 --> 16:19.546
This is amazing.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.249
It's so kind of you.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.584
Well, that's what
best friends are for.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.153
Well, here.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.220
A toast, then.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.023
To gettin' 'er done.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.160
Starting tomorrow
at the crack of dawn.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.763
Maybe we should
just call it a night.

16:36.896 --> 16:37.997
Yeah, good idea.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.175
[rooster crowing]

16:51.911 --> 16:52.945
What? What is it?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.347
Am I late for work?

16:54.481 --> 16:55.915
It is time to get up.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.451
Let the bachelorette festivities
begin.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.452
Right.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.121
Yeah. I'm up.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.422
Are you up?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.157
That's great.
I'm totally up.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.063
Uh.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.265
What? What's going on?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.170
Why is it still dark out?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.711
I don't know
if this was such a good plan.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.480
Turning this place
into some kind of hotel.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.316
Like, we're ranchers, Dad,
not event planners.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.052
Look, I know you haven't
been keen on the idea,

17:33.186 --> 17:35.655
but it's a way
to bring in more cash,

17:35.788 --> 17:37.624
and right now
that's what we need.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.626
So look at the bright side.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.631
I guess.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.534
I just wish Mom were here.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.236
Because she'd be
so much better at all this.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.604
But hey,

17:51.738 --> 17:53.440
at least you're broadening
your horizons

17:53.573 --> 17:56.709
and getting to know some new
and interesting folks.

18:01.514 --> 18:05.485
[*****]

18:21.934 --> 18:23.270
[screams]

18:26.506 --> 18:27.840
Definitely interesting.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.648
You all right?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.484
Please tell me
there's hot water.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.718
Of course.

18:38.851 --> 18:39.919
It just takes a little while
to heat up

18:40.052 --> 18:41.754
and travel out this way.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.723
But I've got to warn you,
it's a small tank,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.425
so you want to have
a quick shower

18:45.558 --> 18:47.093
so there's enough
for all three of you.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.228
Okay.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.196
So are you good?

18:49.329 --> 18:50.263
Yeah.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.364
Yeah, I'm good.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.665
Well, when you're done,

18:52.799 --> 18:53.566
I'll meet you
over at the barn

18:54.701 --> 18:55.568
Mm-hmm.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.769
All right.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.645
[screams]

19:08.981 --> 19:11.718
[*****]

19:15.555 --> 19:17.624
How was the shower
the second time around?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.459
It was...

19:19.592 --> 19:20.927
better.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.462
Where are Amber and Justin?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.331
They're off with my dad
filling the troughs.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.333
-Ah.
-You and I are on eggs.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.436
Just make sure
you ignore the rooster.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.238
You don't want
to ruffle his feathers.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.439
What will he do?

19:32.572 --> 19:34.274
Protect his turf.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.277
Now, we like to collect
eggs twice a day.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.911
Once early,

19:39.045 --> 19:39.746
and then again later
to help keep the nests clean.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.783
So here, why don't you
collect what we've got?

19:43.916 --> 19:44.884
And be careful.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.853
This is part of breakfast.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.187
Got it.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.292
So what do you do
in the city?

19:52.425 --> 19:56.062
I'm a registrar
for the Norton Art Gallery.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.064
It sounds a lot fancier
than it is.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.632
You always done that?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.534
Oh, gosh, no.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.403
I've been a theater usher.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.804
That was while I was
in college.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.139
Then I worked
as a receptionist

20:07.274 --> 20:08.575
for the Museum of Art.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.677
And then I worked
at another art gallery

20:10.810 --> 20:12.379
before I landed
the registrar job.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.782
So I'm guessing
you enjoy the arts?

20:16.783 --> 20:19.051
Well, maybe not packing them
with duct tape,

20:19.185 --> 20:20.620
but yeah, I do.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.923
I'm guessing you've
always done this? Ranching?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.825
Yep.

20:25.958 --> 20:26.793
Born and raised.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.662
Actually, I've never lived
outside of Main and Seventh.

20:29.796 --> 20:33.366
What is that,
about seven square blocks?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.268
-About that.
-Huh.

20:35.402 --> 20:39.606
So seven square blocks is,

20:39.739 --> 20:40.507
let's see,

20:40.640 --> 20:42.542
it's about 482 acres.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.743
Yeah?

20:43.876 --> 20:46.713
And out here,
we've got over 10,000.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.549
Sounds to me like your world
in the big city

20:49.682 --> 20:51.017
isn't really all that big.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.319
This is all just...

20:52.452 --> 20:53.586
land.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.356
I mean, we've got so much.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.392
Like this little coffee shop
on the corner

20:59.526 --> 21:02.028
that makes
the most incredible lattes.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.996
And then our local pub
right down the street.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.698
And the best place
to get a mani-pedi.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.567
This is all really nice,

21:07.700 --> 21:10.570
but it's just, you know.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.538
Nope.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.672
I don't.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.909
Looks like your
friend's settling in.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.482
Well, that's
just because so far,

21:22.615 --> 21:24.016
it's been like a petting zoo.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.418
I mean, when do we get
really down and dirty?

21:25.552 --> 21:26.586
It's coming.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.687
Okay.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.423
Oh, don't put it up there.
It's not very--

21:32.091 --> 21:33.593
Oh!

21:33.726 --> 21:34.627
Stable.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.900
[Travis] All right, folks.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.235
Unfortunately, this morning,
we don't have any eggs.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.737
But there's still
plenty to eat,

21:44.871 --> 21:47.039
so double up,
and then we'll get to work.

21:49.742 --> 21:50.877
I mean,
it's probably a good thing

21:51.010 --> 21:52.345
we don't have any eggs.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.446
I think we've got enough
saturated fats here

21:53.580 --> 21:54.447
to last a lifetime, right?

21:54.581 --> 21:55.482
[laughing]

21:55.615 --> 21:58.184
How are the new recruits?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.752
Or should I say guests?

22:00.687 --> 22:01.621
Just what I thought.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.989
[woman] That good, huh?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.258
I'll help you
whip them into shape.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.794
I figured
I could count on you.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.061
Always.

22:12.732 --> 22:13.766
When you've had
enough to eat,

22:13.900 --> 22:15.334
I'll meet y'all at the barn

22:15.468 --> 22:16.102
so you can get to know
your horses.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.670
Great.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.640
All right.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.615
Oh, and mucking the stalls
is really no big deal.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.616
Oh, look. Horses.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.317
You three ready to ride?

22:31.451 --> 22:32.819
Gang, this is Kat.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.286
She's been my right hand
on the ranch

22:34.421 --> 22:35.354
since I can remember.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.589
And sometimes his left.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.859
[Travis] All right.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.761
Amber, this here'll be
your horse, Blaze.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.696
Don't worry.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.931
She's not as fast
as her name,

22:45.064 --> 22:45.965
but she handles well.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.300
And Toro can be yours.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.336
Toro? Like, as in bull?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.138
He's a bit stubborn,
that's all.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.239
Where's my horse?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.306
Right over there.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.775
This here's Daisy.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.548
She's beautiful.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.915
And that mane!

23:03.049 --> 23:04.116
Girl, we need
to talk conditioners

23:04.250 --> 23:05.518
to make that shine.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.788
All right, then.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.356
How about we hop on
and get a feel for riding,

23:10.490 --> 23:11.691
seeing as
at the end of the week,

23:11.824 --> 23:12.659
we've got a cattle drive
to conquer.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.026
I'm sorry. A what?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.528
Cattle drive.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.764
You know, when you round up
all the cattle

23:17.897 --> 23:20.399
and lead them out to pasture
for the season?

23:20.533 --> 23:23.169
And you want us to do that?

23:23.302 --> 23:27.707
It is what needs to get done
around here, so...

23:27.840 --> 23:28.508
yeah.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.776
I'm game.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.878
-Let's get practicing.
-Yeah.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.546
Let's do it.

23:35.448 --> 23:36.683
Yeah.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.184
Just put your foot
in the stirrup.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.886
-Here, I'll help.
-I'm trying. I just can't...

23:40.019 --> 23:41.187
Okay. Okay.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.655
-There you go.
-Yep, okay.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.123
And hang on to the reins
with the other hand.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.492
-You got it?
-Mm-hmm.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.760
[Kat] There you go.
great job.

23:47.894 --> 23:48.895
Thanks.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.397
I think I can... Okay.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.899
-There you go. Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.333
All right.
Are you good?

23:54.467 --> 23:55.502
-Yeah.
-You're good. All right.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.670
Now if you're ready,

23:57.804 --> 23:58.671
we'll go for
a bit of a trail ride.

23:58.805 --> 23:59.872
Kat'll take the rear

24:00.006 --> 24:01.240
so none of y'all
will wander off,

24:01.373 --> 24:02.575
and I'll take the lead.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.686
Okay, but hear me out.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.221
I'm really thinking
if her mane was on the right,

24:15.354 --> 24:16.889
it would really frame
her face a lot better.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.025
Yes, yes.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.595
This is stunning.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.130
Good girl, Daisy!

24:24.263 --> 24:26.599
Do you think you could
take a few photos for us?

24:26.733 --> 24:27.934
Uh, yeah. Sure.

24:30.369 --> 24:33.039
So I'm curious.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.774
What would make you turn
your family ranch

24:34.907 --> 24:36.876
into, like, a vacation spot?

24:37.009 --> 24:38.945
It was actually
my dad's idea.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.614
He just thought
it would be great

24:41.748 --> 24:42.982
to share all this
with folks like you.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.952
What does that mean,
folk like me?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.854
You know,

24:47.987 --> 24:51.558
people who don't know
anything about...

24:51.691 --> 24:53.726
well, all this.

24:55.394 --> 24:56.796
[Olivia] Right.

24:56.929 --> 25:00.266
And did you think
it was a good idea?

25:00.399 --> 25:01.968
[howling in distance]

25:04.336 --> 25:05.171
What was that?

25:05.304 --> 25:07.540
Wolves.

25:07.674 --> 25:08.908
Don't worry.
They won't bother us.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.844
I think it's a good idea

25:11.978 --> 25:13.112
if I go and get that cow
and her new calf

25:13.245 --> 25:14.146
from the north pasture.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.849
All right, listen up.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.718
Seeing as this is
your first lesson in riding,

25:18.851 --> 25:20.219
we're just going to sit tight

25:20.352 --> 25:21.821
and let Kat head out
to the north pasture.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.056
Sounds good to me.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.391
No, no, no, no, no.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.759
This is what
we came here for, right?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.027
To dig into ranch life

25:28.160 --> 25:29.696
and learn
what it's really like.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.197
So come on.
Let's giddy-up and do this.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.666
-No, Olivia!
-Olivia, don't!

25:33.800 --> 25:34.867
Stay here.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.707
What is it?

25:41.440 --> 25:45.211
[*****]

25:52.952 --> 25:56.522
[*****]

25:56.656 --> 25:58.290
Olivia.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.666
You all right?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.000
Yeah. I just...

26:08.134 --> 26:09.335
I couldn't hang on anymore.

26:09.468 --> 26:10.837
Don't worry.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.071
We'll take it nice and slow
on the ride back.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.372
Oh, no, no, no.

26:13.505 --> 26:14.874
I am not getting back
on that horse right now.

26:15.007 --> 26:15.541
No way.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.077
All right, then.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.712
Looks like
we're walking back.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.589
[Justin] It was just like
Manhattan on a Friday night.

26:30.723 --> 26:31.891
And then,

26:32.024 --> 26:33.359
I cut to the right
of the cows,

26:33.492 --> 26:34.627
but it charged
in the opposite direction.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.995
But I got a hold of it,

26:36.128 --> 26:37.096
and I drove it back
to the others.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.599
I mean, do we really have
to hear all day

26:40.733 --> 26:43.069
about how she wrangled,
like, one cow?

26:44.036 --> 26:45.004
I mean,
there's all this tack

26:45.137 --> 26:46.238
that needs cleaning, so...

26:46.372 --> 26:47.239
Why don't you leave that,

26:47.373 --> 26:48.641
and I'll show y'all

26:48.775 --> 26:49.742
how we release tension
from the day.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.045
Great.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.848
Uh, Amber, I'm going
to help you with this tack.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.920
So let me guess.
Now it's time to chop wood?

27:01.053 --> 27:02.254
Nope.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.756
We are going to throw these
at that target.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.624
Oh.

27:05.758 --> 27:06.926
Kind of like darts.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.127
Kinda.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.962
Well then, you are in
for a surprise

27:10.096 --> 27:11.831
because we play
every weekend at McCool's,

27:11.964 --> 27:13.866
and I've got to say,
I'm pretty good.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.301
All right, champ.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.369
Have at 'er.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.738
So why do I get the feeling

27:18.871 --> 27:19.872
you don't want
your friend, Amber,

27:20.006 --> 27:21.107
to get the hang of all this?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.142
Well, there's
nothing to tell.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.212
Except that my best friend
is getting married

27:26.345 --> 27:27.246
and moving to a ranch,

27:27.379 --> 27:28.981
so I just thought

27:29.115 --> 27:32.484
that bringing her here
would be like a test run.

27:32.618 --> 27:34.754
Well, I won't argue
if you're having your doubts.

27:34.887 --> 27:35.988
What's that supposed to mean?

27:36.122 --> 27:38.424
You three
are from the city, so...

27:38.557 --> 27:39.425
This might not be your thing.

27:39.558 --> 27:40.760
Really?

27:40.893 --> 27:43.062
Well then, watch this.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.402
Hmm. Not bad.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.742
Meh. It was okay.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.344
So...

27:58.477 --> 28:01.447
what does your friend, Amber,
do in the city?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.115
She's an insurance broker.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.517
But she hates her job
just as much as I do.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.854
What do you
want to be doing?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.656
Well, if I could pick
my dream job,

28:10.790 --> 28:11.858
I would be an artist,

28:11.991 --> 28:14.026
but that's crazy.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.329
Like leaving insurance
to go live on a ranch?

28:17.463 --> 28:18.831
Yes, exactly.

28:19.999 --> 28:20.867
Except your friend's
giving it a shot,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.368
so what if you did?

28:25.004 --> 28:27.706
Well, I did.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.341
I brought
one of my paintings

28:29.475 --> 28:30.977
to the gallery I work at,

28:31.110 --> 28:32.344
and Demetrie Faust,

28:32.478 --> 28:35.281
who is one of
my favorite artists,

28:35.414 --> 28:37.449
said that
it looked "amateur".

28:38.617 --> 28:40.519
Hmm.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.021
Well...

28:42.154 --> 28:43.990
for what it's worth,

28:44.123 --> 28:45.157
you did all right
out there today.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.128
Thanks, but now
you're just saying things.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.764
If you fall off your horse,

28:51.898 --> 28:52.899
you've just got
to pick up the reins

28:53.032 --> 28:54.333
and get back in the saddle.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.803
Otherwise, you'll never
be able to ride.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.181
I am so sorry.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.416
Hey, Dad.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.018
Hey, son.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.753
City folk.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.828
[*****]

29:31.170 --> 29:33.405
Hey, your dad
sent me out here

29:33.539 --> 29:35.074
to do some fencing work.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.442
I guess that's
what you're doing?

29:36.575 --> 29:37.844
Yep.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.912
Not exactly exciting,
but necessary.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.281
Here.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.615
Why don't I show you
how it's done?

29:43.749 --> 29:45.084
Uh, I may be from the city,

29:45.217 --> 29:47.019
but I think I know
how to hammer a nail.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.956
All right.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.531
See? Ta-dah.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.537
Why would you do that?

30:05.671 --> 30:07.106
Because the fencing
has to be good and secure

30:07.239 --> 30:08.474
or else an animal
can get through it.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.877
Here.

30:11.010 --> 30:15.982
So the beautiful thing
about fencing

30:16.115 --> 30:18.217
is that you can do it
on your own.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.353
It's like a seesaw effect.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.788
You get the one side in,

30:22.922 --> 30:23.923
and then you lift it up
on the other.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.224
Go ahead.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.028
Drive it straight through
and into the post.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.163
There you go.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.131
Not bad.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.000
And I'm not just saying that.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.376
Is this all
you've ever done?

30:44.510 --> 30:45.344
Ranching?

30:45.477 --> 30:46.612
Yep.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.314
Hmm.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.550
Do you ever find that

30:51.683 --> 30:53.619
doing the same thing
day in and day out,

30:53.752 --> 30:55.121
it gets a little,

30:55.254 --> 30:57.789
I don't know, boring?

30:58.824 --> 31:00.792
I mean, it doesn't seem like
you have a lot of time for fun.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.428
We have our ways.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.932
Besides, I like what I do.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.135
What about you?

31:09.268 --> 31:10.536
What do you do for fun,

31:10.669 --> 31:13.739
other than darts
at this McCool's place?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.174
Oh, we do lots of things.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.877
Every Friday,

31:19.011 --> 31:20.846
Amber and I order in Thai

31:20.980 --> 31:22.814
from this amazing
takeout place.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.583
Mondays, we go
to the meditation lab

31:24.716 --> 31:26.018
for yoga.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.319
Wednesdays is movie night,

31:27.453 --> 31:28.955
and Thursdays we do laundry.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.357
Sounds to me

31:31.490 --> 31:32.992
like you do the same things
day in and day out.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.462
Well, call me boring,
but today's Monday.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.166
And that means
topping up the manure.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.135
We can come back
to this later.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.703
Look, why don't I just
stay here and work on this?

31:45.837 --> 31:47.673
I don't think you're ready
to tackle all this fencing.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.375
Of course I am.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.511
All right.
Knock yourself out.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.013
Great.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.847
So how much exactly
do you need me to do?

31:55.982 --> 31:59.085
Well, you see how the fence
carries on down the pasture?

31:59.218 --> 32:00.319
[Olivia] Yep.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.653
[Travis]
So what you want to do

32:01.787 --> 32:02.754
is just keep following it along

32:02.888 --> 32:04.056
and keep fixing it

32:04.190 --> 32:05.157
until there isn't
any more fence.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.094
Okay, no problem.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.074
Let me see...

32:38.257 --> 32:42.561
[*****]

32:49.701 --> 32:53.139
[*****]

33:00.246 --> 33:02.148
Seesaw...

33:07.886 --> 33:09.455
How did he do the seesaw...

33:16.128 --> 33:17.696
Really?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.098
There.

33:25.637 --> 33:26.605
Good enough.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.475
There's nothing out here,
anyway.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.521
[bull grunting]

33:48.560 --> 33:50.096
[bull grunting]

33:55.467 --> 33:57.169
What?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.212
[bull grunting]

34:09.547 --> 34:11.683
I can at least catch
some rays out here.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.021
You finished already?

34:16.155 --> 34:17.188
Yep.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.224
All done.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.359
That's great.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.659
Yeah.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.695
Did you need me
to do anything else, or...

34:23.829 --> 34:25.030
Nah. Take a moment.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.297
You deserve it.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.768
Hey, I just got a call.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.170
Some of the cattle

34:31.303 --> 34:32.504
have wandered
over to Dawson Ranch.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.605
Well, how'd
they get out there?

34:33.739 --> 34:34.906
I don't know.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.242
Must be a gap
in the fencing.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.376
I did it
the way that you showed me,

34:37.509 --> 34:38.710
but there was just so much,

34:38.844 --> 34:40.112
and I couldn't finish
the fence.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.214
Wait. You did the fencing?

34:44.516 --> 34:46.016
Come on.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.386
Let's go get those cattle.

34:47.518 --> 34:48.520
Did you need me
to come help, or-

34:48.654 --> 34:50.156
No.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.700
Hey there, Mr. McCleary.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.502
Do you need any help
with anything?

35:03.635 --> 35:06.037
I think I'm doing all right.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.774
We're just exercising
some horses.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.075
Why don't you take a break?

35:10.209 --> 35:12.378
Well, I already did that

35:12.511 --> 35:14.480
when I should've kept
working on the fence.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.183
I heard a few cattle
went wandering.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.285
But don't worry.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.487
Travis looked pretty upset.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.490
He's just used to things
a certain way around here,

35:24.623 --> 35:27.226
and change gets him
all bent out of shape.

35:28.694 --> 35:29.761
I figured

35:29.895 --> 35:31.397
after his mom died

35:31.530 --> 35:34.200
that staying close to home
is what he needed.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.668
But all it's done

35:36.802 --> 35:38.337
is made him
too set in his ways

35:38.470 --> 35:39.605
for his own good.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.241
So I guess us being here

35:42.374 --> 35:43.875
must really
be throwing him off.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.945
A little.

35:47.078 --> 35:50.316
But don't you worry
about them cattle or Travis.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.116
They'll be fine.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.252
Thanks.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.763
Well, it looks like

36:04.896 --> 36:06.432
you got the cattle
all rounded up.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.367
And we put a temporary fix
in that fence.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.270
I shouldn't have
left you out there alone.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.540
All right,

36:14.673 --> 36:16.342
well, I guess
I'll see you all at dinner.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.745
Guess she didn't want
to get her manicure

36:19.878 --> 36:20.812
or whatever mucked up

36:20.946 --> 36:21.913
doing the fence properly.

36:22.047 --> 36:23.449
I mean, this isn't exactly

36:23.582 --> 36:25.150
the resort vacation
I'm sure she's used to.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.686
Yeah, well, you and I
don't take vacations.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.289
Maybe we should.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.630
Olivia, you want
a custom-made Justin steak?

36:38.764 --> 36:39.965
Sure.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.600
Comin' right up, y'all.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.103
Hey, I hardly saw you today.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.439
I know.
I was grinding feed.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.207
Prepare yourself,

36:49.341 --> 36:52.644
because apparently ranchers have
a thing called Manure Monday.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.346
Oh.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.214
Speaking of which,

36:56.348 --> 36:57.449
you know what today is?

36:57.583 --> 36:59.150
-Yoga night?
-Yep.

36:59.285 --> 37:03.188
Hey, we have fun
in the city, right?

37:03.322 --> 37:06.525
Like movie night
and McCool's, of course.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.328
Yeah.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.763
I mean, it was.

37:11.897 --> 37:12.864
What?

37:12.998 --> 37:14.500
It seemed depressing.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.768
And when I met Dylan,
I feel like I just...

37:16.902 --> 37:19.338
I fell in love with him
because he was someone new,

37:19.471 --> 37:23.008
someone who just lives
outside of all of that,

37:23.141 --> 37:24.743
and it seemed...

37:24.876 --> 37:25.811
kind of exciting.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.581
Olivia, Amber,
your J-steaks are ready.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.383
Coming.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.086
Thing is, Liv...

37:35.220 --> 37:38.790
we can't just talk about
all the things we hate forever.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.892
Not without
trying to change it.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.843
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.146
Look, I just wanted to say

38:01.279 --> 38:03.715
how sorry I am for not doing
the job properly.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.984
I understand y'all
didn't grow up on a ranch.

38:07.252 --> 38:09.721
Plus, this is supposed to be
kind of a vacation for you,

38:09.855 --> 38:10.922
so...

38:11.056 --> 38:12.591
I'll ease up.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.660
I think maybe I needed
to change things up a little.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.763
Then here, why don't you
heat that up?

38:18.897 --> 38:19.865
Okay.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.803
Yeah, there you go.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.872
And I'll try
and make this trip

38:27.005 --> 38:28.574
as enjoyable for you
as I can.

38:28.707 --> 38:32.411
I promise to be
a model temporary rancher.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.745
-Deal?
-Deal.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.820
Okay, well,

38:41.953 --> 38:44.322
I guess I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.492
See you in the morning.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.469
[rooster crowing]

38:58.737 --> 39:00.372
Hey, Dazzle-Doozy.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.107
[laughs]

39:02.240 --> 39:03.809
-She's so worried.
-I know.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.477
Morning.

39:05.611 --> 39:06.945
Where's Olivia?

39:07.078 --> 39:08.013
Still sleeping?

39:08.146 --> 39:09.147
Oh, heck no.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.416
She was up before any of us.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.418
Something about
finishing a job.

39:16.922 --> 39:17.789
Hey...

39:17.923 --> 39:18.857
Hey.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.358
You know,
if you miss breakfast,

39:20.492 --> 39:21.827
there won't likely
be any left.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.361
I'll just eat later,
once the job's done.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.930
You really
don't have to do this.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.965
A true rancher wouldn't
leave a job half-done.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.033
Am I right?

39:28.166 --> 39:28.967
Mm-hmm.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.436
Well, here.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.137
It's no fun
working on an empty stomach.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.605
Thanks.

39:35.140 --> 39:35.974
Well then,

39:36.107 --> 39:37.476
we'd better hustle

39:37.609 --> 39:38.677
if we want to have some time
to go tubing.

39:38.810 --> 39:39.545
Tubing?

39:39.678 --> 39:40.979
Like down a silo, or...

39:41.112 --> 39:42.814
You'll see.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.382
Okay.

39:47.653 --> 39:48.620
Did you pack the sunscreen?

39:48.754 --> 39:49.955
Because this skin

39:50.088 --> 39:51.890
is not conditioned
for high noon.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.159
Where exactly
are we tubing?

39:54.292 --> 39:55.393
I don't know,

39:55.527 --> 39:56.828
but hopefully
not down a silo.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.230
Hey, gang.
Ready to go cool off?

39:59.364 --> 40:00.632
Ready as ever.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.334
Oh, you may want
to put on a closed toe.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.270
You've got a better chance
of handling a rattler

40:05.403 --> 40:06.237
in a pair of boots.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.272
Sorry, what?

40:07.405 --> 40:09.007
Meet y'all at the truck.

40:10.942 --> 40:14.079
Did he mean rattler
as in snake?

40:14.212 --> 40:15.814
I guess they come
with the territory.

40:19.718 --> 40:20.952
Here we are.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.387
The river
that runs through our land.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.790
So I suppose the water
must be pretty warm

40:24.923 --> 40:26.357
on a day like today, huh?

40:26.492 --> 40:27.559
Actually, no.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.194
It's glacial runoff, so...

40:29.327 --> 40:31.597
Oh, how refreshing.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.632
This is bear territory,

40:33.765 --> 40:35.433
so if we're lucky,
we'll spot a bear today.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.835
Or two.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.204
These bears you speak of,

40:39.337 --> 40:40.706
are they nocturnal?

40:40.839 --> 40:42.407
Well, if you're talking
about black bears,

40:42.541 --> 40:44.643
they're a little bit of both.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.778
Meaning they like
the mornings and late evenings.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.280
I'm happy
it's high noon now.

40:49.414 --> 40:50.816
Now, grizzlies,

40:50.949 --> 40:52.317
they're pretty much active

40:52.450 --> 40:53.585
all hours of the day
and night.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.053
Foraging, fishing.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.622
Don't worry.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.023
I doubt
we'll come across any.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.093
Now...

41:02.227 --> 41:03.228
let the river do the work.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.162
All you've got to do

41:04.295 --> 41:05.230
is sit back,

41:05.363 --> 41:06.498
relax,

41:06.632 --> 41:08.166
and enjoy the scenery.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.602
Oh, it sounds just like
the lazy river at Club Med.

41:14.372 --> 41:15.473
Oh!

41:15.607 --> 41:16.708
What is it?
Is it a bear?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.578
It's a leech. It's a leech.
I can't, I can't deal.

41:19.711 --> 41:20.846
Please don't tell me
you have to,

41:20.979 --> 41:23.181
like, burn it off
or something.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.349
You could later.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.151
As kindling for the fire.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.753
Oh.

41:31.389 --> 41:32.390
Sorry.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.458
I didn't mean to freak out.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.060
It's an honest mistake.

41:36.294 --> 41:40.265
So does that mean
that there are leeches here?

41:40.398 --> 41:42.233
It's not like a pool, so...

41:43.401 --> 41:44.502
Yeah, you know what?

41:44.636 --> 41:45.604
I don't think
I'm overheating,

41:45.737 --> 41:46.972
so maybe I'll just go back

41:47.105 --> 41:47.839
to see if there's more feed
to grind.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.109
Uh, I'm out, too.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.477
Are you sure?

41:52.611 --> 41:53.812
Because once you get
deep enough--

41:53.945 --> 41:54.946
We'll see you
back at the ranch!

41:55.080 --> 41:55.647
Where the water's moving...

41:59.284 --> 42:01.086
I guess it's just us then.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.126
* Find her by the river...

42:08.259 --> 42:10.028
[shrieks]

42:10.161 --> 42:11.296
It is so cold.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.064
* ...Where the stones shine

42:13.198 --> 42:15.967
* Like the stars

42:16.101 --> 42:20.005
* And stories
flow like water *

42:20.138 --> 42:22.307
* To the ocean

42:22.440 --> 42:26.311
* Wide and far

42:26.444 --> 42:32.317
* She sees all the colors
that we used to see *

42:32.450 --> 42:35.353
* But don't look for
these days *

42:35.486 --> 42:37.823
* She hears a world

42:37.956 --> 42:42.260
* That doesn't speak
of doubt and fear *

42:42.393 --> 42:47.799
* She's amazed
at all the tiny things *

42:47.933 --> 42:52.303
* All the tiny things

42:55.841 --> 42:57.643
So how do you and your friends
know one another?

42:59.410 --> 43:01.012
Well, Justin met Amber and I
at McCool's

43:01.146 --> 43:02.113
during their open mic night.

43:02.247 --> 43:03.581
What's that?

43:04.549 --> 43:06.417
Oh, it's so much fun.

43:06.551 --> 43:07.853
Anyone can go up

43:07.986 --> 43:10.255
and, like, sing
or do a comedy number.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.958
So the three of us
ended up onstage together,

43:13.091 --> 43:17.028
and we just improv'd this,
like, silly rap.

43:17.162 --> 43:18.664
And now it's kind of become
our theme song.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.365
Theme song?

43:20.498 --> 43:21.733
Yeah.

43:21.867 --> 43:24.369
Like our own personal anthem,

43:24.502 --> 43:26.638
or "yee-haw" kind of thing.

43:26.772 --> 43:28.206
Okay.

43:28.339 --> 43:29.875
I think I get it.

43:30.876 --> 43:31.710
And what about
you and Amber?

43:31.843 --> 43:33.244
It all started

43:33.378 --> 43:34.946
when our moms met
when we were in grade school.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.849
It's like we became sisters.

43:38.917 --> 43:40.451
So it must be
hard on you, then.

43:40.585 --> 43:42.253
Her getting engaged
and moving on.

43:43.521 --> 43:44.723
I mean, Amber's a city girl.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.391
We both are.

43:46.524 --> 43:47.859
We don't do all this.

43:49.527 --> 43:52.397
Would you ever leave the ranch
to go live in the city?

43:52.530 --> 43:53.965
Heck no.

43:54.099 --> 43:55.867
I wouldn't set foot in one
if I didn't have to.

43:56.001 --> 43:58.203
That's because I've got
everything I want right here.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.873
Maybe Amber doesn't
have that in the city.

44:02.941 --> 44:04.109
I mean, do you?

44:04.242 --> 44:06.277
Well, no,

44:06.411 --> 44:09.247
but I'm not going
to just drop everything

44:09.380 --> 44:10.716
and come live out here.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.318
I get that.

44:14.419 --> 44:15.586
For what it's worth,

44:15.721 --> 44:17.222
you wear a pair of boots
real well.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.860
I guess we should
head back, huh?

44:21.993 --> 44:23.161
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

44:25.731 --> 44:26.732
You good to paddle upstream?

44:26.865 --> 44:27.799
Seriously?

44:27.933 --> 44:29.267
Just kidding.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.135
Come on. The ranch
is just over the hill.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.277
[Olivia] That water today
was so refreshing.

44:39.410 --> 44:40.979
I feel so good.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.648
Oh, look.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.150
They're so pretty.
They're everywhere.

44:45.283 --> 44:46.384
Yep.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.753
This has always been

44:47.886 --> 44:48.820
the best spot
to find wildflowers.

44:51.823 --> 44:53.191
You know, if you get those
in some water,

44:53.324 --> 44:54.559
they'll likely last
the rest of your trip.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.661
I guess I should go do that.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.463
If you can't find
anything to put them in,

44:58.596 --> 45:00.031
in the guest house,

45:00.165 --> 45:02.133
I'm sure we've got something
in the main house.

45:02.267 --> 45:03.401
Okay.

45:03.534 --> 45:06.637
Maybe I'll do that.

45:06.772 --> 45:09.007
-All right, then.
-Thanks again.

45:09.140 --> 45:09.875
Right.

45:10.008 --> 45:11.843
[*****]

45:27.893 --> 45:29.527
How was the river ride?

45:29.660 --> 45:31.763
It was only Olivia and I.

45:31.897 --> 45:34.399
The others got scared off.

45:34.532 --> 45:36.802
Well, we sure can't afford
a bad review.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.503
I know, Dad.

45:38.636 --> 45:39.537
I am trying.

45:39.670 --> 45:41.206
[Dad] I know you are.

45:41.339 --> 45:42.841
And don't worry.

45:42.974 --> 45:45.343
We'll get
those back taxes paid,

45:45.476 --> 45:46.845
and then we'll be able

45:46.978 --> 45:48.814
to go back to the way
things were around here.

45:56.754 --> 46:01.159
[*****]

46:05.596 --> 46:07.032
-Hey.
-Hey.

46:07.165 --> 46:07.933
There's tea there,
if you want some.

46:08.066 --> 46:09.367
Oh, thanks.

46:10.501 --> 46:11.736
So where's Amber?

46:11.870 --> 46:13.371
Giving Dylan
a Zoom tour of the ranch.

46:13.504 --> 46:15.540
Mm.

46:15.673 --> 46:18.443
You know, you actually
missed a lot of fun today.

46:18.576 --> 46:19.811
Really?

46:19.945 --> 46:21.312
Well, it sounds like

46:21.446 --> 46:22.981
maybe it was better
that we weren't there.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.450
Well, maybe we did
prejudge him a little.

46:26.551 --> 46:27.853
Especially since

46:27.986 --> 46:28.854
the only reason
they're doing all this

46:28.987 --> 46:29.955
is because they have to.

46:30.088 --> 46:31.022
To pay the bills.

46:31.156 --> 46:32.824
Well, maybe he'll get

46:32.958 --> 46:34.225
something else
out of it, too, hmm?

46:34.359 --> 46:35.593
No.

46:35.726 --> 46:36.727
No way.

46:36.862 --> 46:38.029
I am not pulling an Amber.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.398
Besides,
we are complete opposites.

46:40.531 --> 46:41.532
Are you?

46:42.533 --> 46:43.835
I'm just saying.

46:43.969 --> 46:45.303
Maybe not that different.

46:57.448 --> 46:59.217
[Travis singing]

47:00.952 --> 47:02.087
Hello?

47:03.188 --> 47:04.789
-Hey.
-Oh.

47:04.923 --> 47:07.993
Don't you have a shower
in the big house?

47:08.126 --> 47:09.861
Yeah, we do.

47:09.995 --> 47:12.297
But I prefer
to shower outdoors.

47:13.464 --> 47:14.599
It's the best way
to start the day,

47:14.732 --> 47:16.301
if you ask me.

47:20.906 --> 47:22.107
Yeah.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.174
I was just going
to get some coffee

47:23.308 --> 47:24.509
because we ran out, so...

47:24.642 --> 47:25.944
Oh, sure.

47:26.077 --> 47:27.778
Yeah, I'll bring some over
in a moment.

47:27.913 --> 47:29.247
Okay.

47:39.090 --> 47:40.425
All right.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.193
Seeing as the cattle drive's
a few days away,

47:42.327 --> 47:44.362
I think it's important
y'all learn some basics.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.797
First,
it's important to note

47:46.932 --> 47:48.433
that everything we do
with our cows

47:48.566 --> 47:49.500
comes down to driving.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.136
Now, a lot of ranchers,

47:51.269 --> 47:53.671
they aren't too concerned
about how to approach a cow.

47:53.804 --> 47:55.173
But I was always taught

47:55.306 --> 47:56.541
that the first point
of contact's critical.

47:56.674 --> 47:58.143
Like a first impression.

47:58.276 --> 47:59.510
Exactly.

47:59.644 --> 48:01.212
I mean, how would you feel

48:01.346 --> 48:03.681
if someone came at you
with their arms waving?

48:03.814 --> 48:05.550
I'd feel like a cab driver.

48:06.651 --> 48:07.852
So what you want to do

48:07.986 --> 48:09.921
is approach the cow
at an angle,

48:10.055 --> 48:11.722
as if you're just going
to go on by,

48:11.856 --> 48:13.091
so the cow remains calm.

48:14.159 --> 48:15.893
Then, we'll put ourselves
in their pressure zone

48:16.027 --> 48:17.528
to move them along.

48:17.662 --> 48:20.065
So let's give it a try.

48:21.066 --> 48:22.133
Okay.

48:23.534 --> 48:24.802
All right, Amber.
You're up.

48:24.936 --> 48:26.504
All right.
Come on, girl.

48:26.637 --> 48:27.605
Whoo!

48:27.738 --> 48:29.840
[*****]

48:29.975 --> 48:31.142
Whoa!

48:33.844 --> 48:36.081
Guys! Check this out!

48:36.214 --> 48:37.482
[Travis]
All right, that's it. Yep.

48:37.615 --> 48:39.517
Push 'em from the hip.

48:39.650 --> 48:40.718
[Amber] Whoa. Whoa.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.320
Sorry.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.255
-[laughs]
-[Amber] I got it!

48:47.158 --> 48:52.263
[*****]

48:52.397 --> 48:54.099
It's your turn, Justin.
Get out there.

48:54.832 --> 48:55.900
[Justin] Okay.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.068
Okay, come on, Daisy.

48:57.202 --> 48:58.069
Here we go!

48:58.203 --> 48:59.737
Yeah! Whoo!

48:59.870 --> 49:01.272
So like with Amber,

49:01.406 --> 49:02.373
you've got to push 'em
from the shoulder.

49:02.507 --> 49:03.241
Yeah. Okay.

49:03.374 --> 49:04.775
Turn 'em with the head.

49:04.909 --> 49:06.544
Okay, we want to get him
in through that corral.

49:06.677 --> 49:07.945
Yeah.

49:09.847 --> 49:11.116
[Justin] This is hard.

49:11.749 --> 49:13.551
Come on!

49:13.684 --> 49:14.685
I got it!

49:16.654 --> 49:18.456
Okay, Olivia.
Pull back on the reins.

49:18.589 --> 49:20.025
[Olivia] Okay.

49:21.859 --> 49:23.394
[Travis] That's it.

49:23.528 --> 49:25.363
[Olivia] Hey, come back here.
Where are you guys going?

49:29.300 --> 49:30.368
Am I doing it?

49:42.147 --> 49:43.114
Nice.

49:46.051 --> 49:50.055
[*****]

49:51.222 --> 49:52.090
Look at that.

49:52.223 --> 49:53.558
I did it.

49:53.691 --> 49:54.925
No stress here, baby.

49:55.060 --> 49:56.661
I think that's enough
for one day.

49:56.794 --> 49:58.229
Don't want you dancing
bowlegged all night.

49:58.363 --> 49:59.597
Did you say dancing?

49:59.730 --> 50:01.632
Yep. Saturday nights,

50:01.766 --> 50:02.867
we all get together
at the Black Hoof

50:03.000 --> 50:03.768
and kick up our boots.

50:03.901 --> 50:04.769
What do you know?

50:04.902 --> 50:06.137
Almost like home.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.406
But first,

50:08.539 --> 50:10.175
we need some fish
for tomorrow night's fish fry.

50:10.308 --> 50:11.542
So who's up
for a little fishing?

50:11.676 --> 50:13.144
I'm in.

50:13.911 --> 50:15.580
Actually, I think Amber and I

50:15.713 --> 50:17.182
will just stick around

50:17.315 --> 50:18.616
and work on our driving
just a little bit more.

50:18.749 --> 50:20.085
But you two go.

50:20.218 --> 50:21.986
I mean, Olivia is
like a pro at this, so...

50:22.120 --> 50:23.488
[laughs]

50:23.621 --> 50:24.755
Um, okay,

50:24.889 --> 50:26.791
but I haven't really done
any fishing, so...

50:26.924 --> 50:28.726
Ah, don't worry about it.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.295
It'll be the easiest
thing you do all week.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.837
[*****]

50:39.970 --> 50:42.173
So what kind of things
do you like to paint?

50:42.307 --> 50:44.209
Whatever inspires me,
I guess.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.778
But to be honest,

50:47.912 --> 50:49.547
I haven't been inspired
to touch a paintbrush

50:49.680 --> 50:52.150
in forever.

50:52.283 --> 50:53.551
Does that mean

50:53.684 --> 50:54.719
you're just going
to keep doing

50:54.852 --> 50:55.753
this job you hate?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.088
Except now you won't have

50:57.222 --> 50:58.089
your best friend
to commiserate with.

50:58.223 --> 50:59.524
Hey, you could stand

50:59.657 --> 51:01.159
to try something new
yourself.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.228
I mean, at least I'm here,

51:03.361 --> 51:04.829
completely out of
my comfort zone.

51:04.962 --> 51:06.164
[Travis] Because you want
to convince your friend

51:06.297 --> 51:07.832
of her mistake.

51:07.965 --> 51:09.234
So?

51:09.367 --> 51:11.236
At least
I'm giving it my all.

51:12.470 --> 51:13.871
I mean, look at you.

51:14.004 --> 51:15.873
You said you never
even set foot in New York.

51:16.006 --> 51:17.842
You got that right.

51:17.975 --> 51:19.310
It's a good thing.

51:19.444 --> 51:20.678
Because you wouldn't have
a clue what to do

51:20.811 --> 51:21.979
when you got there.

51:22.113 --> 51:23.381
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

51:23.514 --> 51:26.884
Okay, so you're saying

51:27.017 --> 51:28.253
you'd know how to get a cab
during rush hour

51:28.386 --> 51:30.020
without getting it poached?

51:31.021 --> 51:33.358
Or how to not get crushed
by the subway doors?

51:33.491 --> 51:36.361
Or how about
which food vendors to eat at

51:36.494 --> 51:37.395
and which to avoid?

51:38.763 --> 51:40.097
Well, no,

51:40.231 --> 51:41.199
but how hard could it be?

51:41.332 --> 51:42.600
Uh-uh.
Don't even.

51:42.733 --> 51:43.968
Because trust me,

51:44.101 --> 51:45.136
it is as hard

51:45.270 --> 51:46.671
as me trying to lasso a bull.

51:48.439 --> 51:49.974
Or get this dang thing
untangled.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.209
Just give it a gentle tug.

51:51.342 --> 51:52.410
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

51:53.244 --> 51:54.412
Oh!

51:55.680 --> 51:56.714
[both laughing]

52:00.318 --> 52:01.786
[*****]

52:01.919 --> 52:03.754
So how's the event plan?

52:03.888 --> 52:05.122
All right.

52:05.256 --> 52:06.357
That Olivia's
a bit of a handful.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.359
[Dad] Oh, here's
the crew now.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.297
Uh, guys, I think

52:12.430 --> 52:14.064
we might be
a tad overdressed.

52:14.199 --> 52:15.600
There's no such thing.

52:15.733 --> 52:17.502
This place could totally pass
for McCool's.

52:17.635 --> 52:20.705
Guys, they even have a mic
for karaoke.

52:20.838 --> 52:22.673
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

52:22.807 --> 52:23.808
Yee-haw.

52:26.211 --> 52:27.545
What are they doing?

52:33.384 --> 52:34.419
[rapping]
My name's Olivia,

52:34.552 --> 52:35.553
it's Liv for short,

52:35.686 --> 52:38.789
and I'm an artist at heart.

52:38.923 --> 52:40.057
I'm hanging with my girl,

52:40.191 --> 52:41.559
she's Amber,
my best friend,

52:41.692 --> 52:43.394
who gets me
and makes it all better, yeah.

52:43.528 --> 52:45.095
That's right, I'm Amber,

52:45.230 --> 52:46.597
that's what we do,

52:46.731 --> 52:47.632
raise a glass

52:47.765 --> 52:49.200
and talk about things
so true.

52:49.334 --> 52:54.239
'Cause we fit like a glove.

52:54.372 --> 52:55.506
Justin here,

52:55.640 --> 52:57.107
and I love these two,

52:57.242 --> 52:58.443
so I'm going
to get in on it

52:58.576 --> 53:00.278
and tell it all to you.

53:00.411 --> 53:02.847
And okay, that's cool,
the cow goes moo,

53:02.980 --> 53:06.116
but I miss Manhattan
and the taxis, too.

53:06.251 --> 53:07.585
City life is the best

53:07.718 --> 53:09.186
and there's nothing better

53:09.320 --> 53:12.122
than us three
getting a latte together.

53:12.257 --> 53:14.625
Ooh!

53:22.300 --> 53:23.901
Hey, y'all,
my name's Travis.

53:24.034 --> 53:25.803
And I'm a rancher.

53:28.639 --> 53:30.308
[starts rapping] I lead
my cattle out to the pasture.

53:30.441 --> 53:32.243
Been ranchin' my whole life.

53:32.377 --> 53:33.744
It just feels right.

53:33.878 --> 53:35.813
And if you know me,
you know that's no...

53:35.946 --> 53:37.014
Bull.

53:37.147 --> 53:39.350
Yeah.

53:42.687 --> 53:44.389
Give it up for the city folks.

53:51.862 --> 53:54.899
* Baby, won't you
come home? *

53:55.032 --> 53:58.403
* I never felt so alone

53:58.536 --> 54:02.006
* It's been too long a time

54:02.139 --> 54:06.176
* Oh, how I miss you
baby of mine *

54:06.311 --> 54:10.881
[*****]

54:14.652 --> 54:18.856
[*****]

54:24.228 --> 54:27.231
* Things with you
aren't always right *

54:27.365 --> 54:28.966
* Oh, Lord
how we tumble *

54:29.099 --> 54:30.435
* Tussle and fight

54:30.568 --> 54:31.869
[*****]

54:32.002 --> 54:34.872
* Things will be
different someday *

54:35.005 --> 54:36.507
* Oh, let
this hard-headed girl *

54:36.641 --> 54:38.576
* Drive you away

54:41.178 --> 54:44.882
[*****]

54:51.288 --> 54:54.892
[*****]

54:56.126 --> 54:57.462
Well, thank you

54:57.595 --> 54:59.564
for not leaving us
out to dry up there.

54:59.697 --> 55:01.866
Yeah, we look out
for one another around here.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.702
I kind of like that little
two-step you taught us.

55:07.572 --> 55:09.273
You know, we...

55:09.407 --> 55:11.075
take it a bit easier
on Sundays,

55:11.208 --> 55:13.243
so if you want,

55:13.378 --> 55:16.080
I can give you another tour,

55:16.213 --> 55:17.782
seeing as my first one
may have been lacking.

55:17.915 --> 55:20.317
You mean
the point-and-look tour?

55:20.451 --> 55:21.486
"Oh, and over there
behind the barn

55:21.619 --> 55:23.087
is the hen coop.

55:23.220 --> 55:24.622
House is over there.

55:24.755 --> 55:26.791
Land is over there."

55:26.924 --> 55:27.925
[chuckles]

55:28.058 --> 55:29.093
Okay, I get it.

55:29.226 --> 55:30.761
So what do you say?

55:30.895 --> 55:32.162
Redo?

55:32.296 --> 55:34.131
I mean, I wouldn't want you
giving a bad review.

55:34.264 --> 55:35.633
I would love a redo.

55:36.534 --> 55:37.902
Thank you.

55:38.035 --> 55:39.870
Hey. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.038
No, no.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.774
We were just decompressing,
you know,

55:43.908 --> 55:46.577
from driving cattle
and fishing today.

55:47.445 --> 55:48.713
Wow.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.180
Too bad
you're only here for a week.

55:50.314 --> 55:51.782
That's right.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.452
Blowing in and out of here
like a tumbleweed.

56:00.425 --> 56:02.460
-Well, see you tomorrow.
-Sure will.

56:16.106 --> 56:17.642
[rooster crowing]

56:22.813 --> 56:23.814
Ugh!

56:23.948 --> 56:25.950
Shh!

56:32.990 --> 56:33.858
Morning.

56:33.991 --> 56:35.159
Hey.

56:35.292 --> 56:37.094
How's the crew doing?

56:37.227 --> 56:38.829
I think a bit too much
giddy-up last night.

56:40.598 --> 56:41.532
How about you?

56:41.666 --> 56:44.101
Slept like a log.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.003
Actually, I've slept like
a log every night

56:46.136 --> 56:47.037
since I've been here.

56:47.171 --> 56:48.072
It's the country air.

56:48.205 --> 56:49.474
It's like medicine.

56:49.607 --> 56:51.108
So are you ready
for a little adventure?

56:51.241 --> 56:52.577
You bet.

56:53.978 --> 56:56.213
Then hop in.

56:56.346 --> 56:57.815
Okay.

57:01.719 --> 57:06.491
[*****]

57:20.437 --> 57:25.576
[*****]

57:31.348 --> 57:35.520
[*****]

57:49.634 --> 57:51.035
Wow.

57:51.168 --> 57:54.639
This is the most stunning
view I have ever seen.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.975
If you look to that point
way over there

57:58.108 --> 58:00.545
and follow it all the way across
to that ridge?

58:01.879 --> 58:03.147
What you're looking at
is all our land.

58:04.248 --> 58:06.216
This really does make
the city seem pretty small.

58:08.853 --> 58:11.956
I got you something.

58:14.324 --> 58:15.325
It's not professional quality,

58:15.459 --> 58:17.628
but it's all I had.

58:18.663 --> 58:20.264
This is really so thoughtful.

58:20.397 --> 58:22.132
I just...

58:22.266 --> 58:24.168
I haven't painted anything
in so long.

58:24.301 --> 58:27.371
Well, you said you'd paint
what inspired you,

58:27.504 --> 58:29.640
and I don't know,

58:29.774 --> 58:31.108
but to me,

58:31.241 --> 58:33.010
it doesn't get more inspiring
than this.

58:33.143 --> 58:34.111
I mean, my dad,

58:34.244 --> 58:36.947
he goes to church
every Sunday.

58:37.081 --> 58:39.617
But here,

58:39.750 --> 58:40.851
this is where
I've been coming

58:40.985 --> 58:42.186
ever since my mom passed.

58:43.754 --> 58:48.125
Somehow, the sun, breeze...

58:48.258 --> 58:50.127
it all just makes me
feel closer to her.

58:51.495 --> 58:53.631
I think you're right.

58:53.764 --> 58:55.532
Maybe it is time
I had another go.

58:56.801 --> 58:58.202
But no peeking.

58:58.335 --> 58:59.637
Don't worry.

58:59.770 --> 59:01.538
I've got some chapters
to catch up on.

59:02.940 --> 59:04.675
I promise
to keep myself busy.

59:10.848 --> 59:14.785
[*****]

59:22.526 --> 59:25.996
[*****]

59:34.538 --> 59:38.976
[*****]

59:46.383 --> 59:47.718
All right.

59:48.719 --> 59:50.655
You ready?

1:00:01.031 --> 1:00:03.200
I'm sure it looks amateur.

1:00:03.333 --> 1:00:04.301
No.

1:00:04.434 --> 1:00:05.636
No, it's incredible.

1:00:05.770 --> 1:00:06.904
You're not just saying that,
are you?

1:00:07.037 --> 1:00:08.072
There are some things

1:00:11.041 --> 1:00:11.942
This...

1:00:12.076 --> 1:00:13.177
is definitely one of them.

1:00:14.211 --> 1:00:15.445
Now come on.

1:00:15.579 --> 1:00:16.413
You want to try your hand
at a little off-roading?

1:00:16.546 --> 1:00:17.414
For real?

1:00:17.547 --> 1:00:18.916
Well, the only thing

1:00:19.049 --> 1:00:19.950
you've got to be
on the lookout for around here

1:00:20.084 --> 1:00:20.985
are animal crossings.

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:22.052
Huh.

1:00:22.186 --> 1:00:23.087
Piece of cake.

1:00:24.188 --> 1:00:25.189
Yee-haw!

1:00:26.924 --> 1:00:28.258
This is so much fun.

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:40.905
Oh, no!

1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:51.749
Is it a flat?

1:00:51.882 --> 1:00:53.317
I just-- I didn't want
to hit that turtle.

1:00:53.450 --> 1:00:54.685
I think I hit a big rock.

1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:57.755
[Travis] Yeah, looks like
a busted driveshaft.

1:00:58.756 --> 1:00:59.990
Meaning?

1:01:02.459 --> 1:01:04.061
Meaning we're walking back.

1:01:07.965 --> 1:01:09.366
Sorry about your truck.

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:10.701
Don't worry about it.

1:01:10.835 --> 1:01:12.937
I'll get it towed
back to the ranch.

1:01:14.338 --> 1:01:15.806
[howling]

1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:17.775
If it's the wildlife
you're worried about,

1:01:17.908 --> 1:01:19.343
don't be.

1:01:19.476 --> 1:01:21.779
I mean, for the most part,

1:01:21.912 --> 1:01:23.914
they don't want
anything to do with us.

1:01:24.048 --> 1:01:25.950
And the other part?

1:01:27.117 --> 1:01:29.619
Here's what you need to know
about the animals around here.

1:01:29.754 --> 1:01:32.122
For starters,
this is their territory,

1:01:32.256 --> 1:01:33.824
so we need to respect that.

1:01:34.658 --> 1:01:35.659
Like the rooster.

1:01:35.793 --> 1:01:37.127
[Travis] Exactly.

1:01:37.261 --> 1:01:38.495
Nothing's going
to come pecking at you

1:01:38.628 --> 1:01:39.930
if it doesn't feel threatened.

1:01:42.666 --> 1:01:45.135
And what about that?

1:01:45.269 --> 1:01:47.471
The wolves?

1:01:47.604 --> 1:01:50.374
We normally don't have
to worry about them.

1:01:50.507 --> 1:01:52.376
Well...

1:01:52.509 --> 1:01:54.478
well, when would you worry?

1:01:54.611 --> 1:01:57.047
Well, when you're talking
about a lone wolf.

1:01:57.181 --> 1:01:58.783
They can be more aggressive

1:01:58.916 --> 1:02:00.717
because they don't have
the support of the pack.

1:02:00.851 --> 1:02:03.087
Like that day
we went on a trail ride.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:04.822
Normally, I would've left
those cows out to pasture,

1:02:04.955 --> 1:02:07.291
but we both saw something.

1:02:07.424 --> 1:02:09.927
Figured it'd be best
to drive 'em back.

1:02:10.060 --> 1:02:13.397
I had no idea.

1:02:13.530 --> 1:02:15.299
And here I was
trying to prove my point.

1:02:16.934 --> 1:02:18.435
You're right.

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:21.238
I am bothered by how Amber
seems to be catching on

1:02:21.371 --> 1:02:24.842
and not freaking out
like I thought she would.

1:02:26.576 --> 1:02:28.112
Because then she'd stay.

1:02:28.245 --> 1:02:30.514
Hmm.

1:02:30.647 --> 1:02:32.182
I get it's hard

1:02:32.316 --> 1:02:34.852
not having that person
you confide your thoughts to.

1:02:34.985 --> 1:02:36.887
I mean, for me,
it was my mom.

1:02:37.822 --> 1:02:38.688
We'd sit by the fire

1:02:38.823 --> 1:02:40.124
and talk about

1:02:40.257 --> 1:02:41.058
all the adventures
we'd go on together.

1:02:42.059 --> 1:02:43.493
It sounds like
you were really close.

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:45.896
We were.

1:02:46.831 --> 1:02:48.265
She was so full of life.

1:02:49.466 --> 1:02:51.936
I mean, she would have loved
this whole dude ranch thing.

1:02:53.871 --> 1:02:55.039
After she was gone,

1:02:55.172 --> 1:02:57.007
I just threw myself
into work.

1:02:58.175 --> 1:03:01.345
Didn't think about
any of those adventures anymore.

1:03:01.478 --> 1:03:02.947
Just stayed the course.

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.381
Day in, day out.

1:03:06.550 --> 1:03:07.451
Amber and I,

1:03:07.584 --> 1:03:09.086
we always talk about

1:03:09.219 --> 1:03:11.288
all the things
we're going to do.

1:03:12.589 --> 1:03:14.258
Now she is doing something.

1:03:15.392 --> 1:03:18.562
And me...

1:03:18.695 --> 1:03:20.164
well, I'm not.

1:03:20.297 --> 1:03:23.333
You can think about
that painting you did today.

1:03:23.467 --> 1:03:25.502
Who knows?

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:27.204
Maybe that'll inspire
more good thoughts.

1:03:28.138 --> 1:03:29.673
Maybe those memories
of your mom

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:31.808
will get you thinking
about those adventures again.

1:03:32.910 --> 1:03:34.311
Maybe.

1:03:35.712 --> 1:03:37.614
Well, thank you.

1:03:37.747 --> 1:03:39.116
For everything today.

1:03:39.249 --> 1:03:43.420
Well, don't go writing
about it in your review.

1:03:43.553 --> 1:03:45.055
Or else everybody

1:03:45.189 --> 1:03:46.957
will think they'll get
the same special treatment.

1:03:50.127 --> 1:03:53.998
[*****]

1:03:59.269 --> 1:04:00.170
Morning.

1:04:00.304 --> 1:04:01.405
Coffee?

1:04:01.538 --> 1:04:03.874
Maybe a double espresso
would be good.

1:04:04.008 --> 1:04:05.509
I'm beginning to think

1:04:05.642 --> 1:04:07.477
this coffee tastes
a little better than my lattes.

1:04:07.611 --> 1:04:08.812
It really gives you
that giddy-up and go.

1:04:08.946 --> 1:04:10.280
I could use it.

1:04:11.248 --> 1:04:12.516
Are you having
a 48-hour recovery?

1:04:12.649 --> 1:04:14.151
No.

1:04:14.284 --> 1:04:16.453
I spent my entire Sunday
practicing my cattle driving,

1:04:16.586 --> 1:04:18.322
and it was a lot of hours
on horseback.

1:04:18.455 --> 1:04:21.091
Well, you'd better
get used to it.

1:04:23.193 --> 1:04:25.295
All right. I am off
to do my morning chores.

1:04:25.429 --> 1:04:26.596
Oh-

1:04:32.236 --> 1:04:33.303
Morning, rooster.

1:04:33.437 --> 1:04:34.538
Don't mind me.

1:04:34.671 --> 1:04:35.505
I'm just going to help out
the ladies here.

1:04:39.743 --> 1:04:41.111
Throw that on bread
with a little ham,

1:04:41.245 --> 1:04:42.947
got the perfect western.

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:44.915
Who's next?

1:04:45.049 --> 1:04:46.550
All right.
There you are.

1:04:46.683 --> 1:04:47.551
Enjoy.

1:04:47.684 --> 1:04:49.186
Step right up, sir.

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:03.733
[Kat] Hey.

1:05:03.867 --> 1:05:05.135
Do you want to take a ride?

1:05:05.269 --> 1:05:06.370
I'm headed into town.

1:05:06.503 --> 1:05:08.172
Nah.

1:05:08.305 --> 1:05:10.140
I think I'll stay here
and keep an eye on the guests.

1:05:13.543 --> 1:05:15.045
Well, I can't say
I blame you.

1:05:15.179 --> 1:05:16.947
I never would've believed it,

1:05:17.081 --> 1:05:18.215
but...

1:05:18.348 --> 1:05:20.184
they're doing all right.

1:05:20.317 --> 1:05:22.519
Especially Olivia.

1:05:22.652 --> 1:05:24.521
She's really
throwing herself into it.

1:05:26.156 --> 1:05:27.524
Well, I'm sure

1:05:27.657 --> 1:05:28.858
it's going to make a great story
for her Instagram

1:05:28.993 --> 1:05:30.694
when she gets back to New York.

1:05:30.827 --> 1:05:33.030
I mean, we both know
she's still a city girl.

1:05:34.064 --> 1:05:36.033
-Right?
-Of course.

1:05:56.686 --> 1:05:57.887
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:05:58.022 --> 1:05:59.456
I finished all my chores,

1:05:59.589 --> 1:06:00.590
so I was thinking

1:06:00.724 --> 1:06:02.726
I'd like to take
some of those paints

1:06:02.859 --> 1:06:05.595
and head out on my own
into the pasture.

1:06:05.729 --> 1:06:06.830
Hopefully get
some more inspiration.

1:06:06.963 --> 1:06:08.999
Sounds like a great idea.

1:06:09.133 --> 1:06:11.668
But hey, don't wander
off too far, now.

1:06:11.801 --> 1:06:12.969
I won't.

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:27.584
[neighs]

1:06:27.717 --> 1:06:28.985
Toro? What is it?

1:06:42.832 --> 1:06:44.168
Okay.

1:06:45.135 --> 1:06:46.170
It's okay, Olivia.

1:06:46.303 --> 1:06:48.038
Don't freak out.

1:06:48.172 --> 1:06:49.473
You are not a threat.

1:07:14.364 --> 1:07:16.966
It just stood there,
staring at me.

1:07:17.101 --> 1:07:18.802
And then it started
to come closer.

1:07:18.935 --> 1:07:20.570
You sure it was alone?

1:07:20.704 --> 1:07:22.106
As far as I could tell.

1:07:23.107 --> 1:07:23.873
Do you think it was
that lone wolf?

1:07:24.007 --> 1:07:26.042
Could have been.

1:07:26.176 --> 1:07:27.411
Either way, I think it's best

1:07:27.544 --> 1:07:29.313
if we round up
as many cattle as we can

1:07:29.446 --> 1:07:31.481
and bring 'em back
to the corral.

1:07:31.615 --> 1:07:32.649
All right.

1:07:32.782 --> 1:07:33.883
I'll go saddle up.

1:07:34.017 --> 1:07:35.119
Olivia, wait.

1:07:35.252 --> 1:07:37.287
What?

1:07:38.522 --> 1:07:39.623
I'll meet you by the barn.

1:07:49.633 --> 1:07:50.567
Whoa.

1:07:52.469 --> 1:07:53.370
Right over there.

1:07:53.503 --> 1:07:55.139
That's where I saw it.

1:07:56.306 --> 1:07:57.607
Yeah, I think
he should've gone back

1:07:57.741 --> 1:07:58.575
to his pack by now.

1:08:03.547 --> 1:08:04.948
What?

1:08:05.081 --> 1:08:07.217
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were a country girl.

1:08:10.820 --> 1:08:12.156
[growling]

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:16.660
-[horses whinnying]
-Whoa.

1:08:19.228 --> 1:08:20.397
Olivia.

1:08:21.997 --> 1:08:23.166
You all right?

1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:25.269
Yeah. All good.

1:08:26.469 --> 1:08:28.572
Here. Back 'em up.

1:08:28.705 --> 1:08:29.973
Back off.

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:31.774
Back off nice and slow.

1:08:36.246 --> 1:08:37.714
[shot fires]

1:08:40.684 --> 1:08:41.585
Y'all all right?

1:08:42.685 --> 1:08:43.687
Yeah.

1:08:43.819 --> 1:08:45.555
Yeah, I think
you scared it off.

1:08:45.689 --> 1:08:47.056
Good.

1:08:47.191 --> 1:08:49.125
Let's hope it goes back
to its pack where it belongs.

1:08:51.428 --> 1:08:52.629
Well, I'd say

1:08:52.762 --> 1:08:55.064
that's enough excitement
for one day.

1:08:55.199 --> 1:08:56.600
How about we get
that cattle corralled?

1:09:09.345 --> 1:09:10.580
Okay, like this?

1:09:12.081 --> 1:09:13.082
That was pretty good.

1:09:13.217 --> 1:09:14.783
Not bad, not bad.

1:09:14.917 --> 1:09:16.653
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:09:16.786 --> 1:09:19.223
I heard we missed
an exciting day.

1:09:19.356 --> 1:09:23.727
Yeah, but Annie-Got-Her-Gun
over there came to the rescue.

1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:25.862
I get that
we're from the city,

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:27.197
but she doesn't have to make it
so obvious

1:09:27.331 --> 1:09:28.665
that she thinks I don't belong.

1:09:28.798 --> 1:09:30.666
I mean, I can do
a lot of stuff around here.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.335
Of course you can.

1:09:32.469 --> 1:09:33.836
You know what?

1:09:33.969 --> 1:09:36.406
You are going
to show her what's up.

1:09:38.407 --> 1:09:39.776
-I am?
-Yes.

1:09:39.908 --> 1:09:41.444
Yes, you are.

1:09:42.312 --> 1:09:44.314
Come on.

1:09:44.448 --> 1:09:45.648
Hey, all.

1:09:45.782 --> 1:09:47.183
Who's up for
a best set of three?

1:09:47.317 --> 1:09:48.952
I'm in.

1:09:49.085 --> 1:09:50.085
Okay, great.

1:09:50.219 --> 1:09:52.289
Well, you and Olivia are up.

1:09:53.990 --> 1:09:56.693
Go show her what's up, okay?

1:10:01.398 --> 1:10:02.599
Here we go.

1:10:05.934 --> 1:10:08.204
Okay. Not bad.

1:10:13.610 --> 1:10:14.978
Yes!

1:10:15.111 --> 1:10:16.646
Hey.

1:10:17.647 --> 1:10:19.316
-Here we go.
-That's beginner's luck.

1:10:19.449 --> 1:10:20.650
We'll see.

1:10:21.785 --> 1:10:22.619
Whoo, Kat.

1:10:26.790 --> 1:10:28.358
Okay.

1:10:31.928 --> 1:10:33.463
All right.
Here we go, here we go.

1:10:34.364 --> 1:10:35.665
Yes!

1:10:39.469 --> 1:10:40.804
Tiebreaker.

1:10:45.709 --> 1:10:46.710
Oh!

1:10:46.843 --> 1:10:48.512
Good try.
That was great.

1:10:48.645 --> 1:10:50.480
Bound to happen
eventually, Kat.

1:10:53.483 --> 1:10:54.851
You've got to miss sometime.

1:10:57.085 --> 1:10:58.388
Eye on the prize.

1:11:02.025 --> 1:11:03.660
Olivia! Oh, my gosh.

1:11:04.861 --> 1:11:05.829
[cheering]

1:11:08.498 --> 1:11:09.499
Oh, my gosh.

1:11:09.633 --> 1:11:11.868
Amber, that was amazing.

1:11:12.001 --> 1:11:14.438
I mean, she can't say that
we don't belong now, right?

1:11:14.571 --> 1:11:16.205
We can so do this.

1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:18.942
Yeah. I mean,
you definitely can.

1:11:19.075 --> 1:11:21.445
Me, I am not so sure.

1:11:22.679 --> 1:11:23.713
Hey.

1:11:23.847 --> 1:11:25.514
Come on.
Sure you can.

1:11:26.883 --> 1:11:28.785
I don't know.

1:11:28.918 --> 1:11:30.053
Maybe I am making
a big mistake

1:11:30.186 --> 1:11:32.389
by marrying a rancher.

1:11:32.522 --> 1:11:33.590
What are you talking about?

1:11:33.723 --> 1:11:35.725
Come on,
you're crushing it here.

1:11:35.859 --> 1:11:37.794
No, I'm not.

1:11:37.927 --> 1:11:39.329
I mean,
it only looks that way

1:11:39.463 --> 1:11:40.697
because I was trying
to show you

1:11:40.830 --> 1:11:41.630
that I'm not making
a big mistake.

1:11:42.932 --> 1:11:45.134
I don't know
what I'm doing.

1:11:45.268 --> 1:11:46.503
I mean, I don't know

1:11:46.636 --> 1:11:48.505
how to manage a ranch
or drive cattle.

1:11:48.638 --> 1:11:50.639
I do know you.

1:11:50.773 --> 1:11:53.410
Because you're like
a sister to me.

1:11:53.543 --> 1:11:55.344
Which is why
I don't want you to leave,

1:11:55.478 --> 1:11:56.480
but...

1:11:56.612 --> 1:11:58.448
it's time we made a change.

1:12:00.049 --> 1:12:01.918
So what you're doing...

1:12:02.050 --> 1:12:02.952
is not a mistake.

1:12:03.085 --> 1:12:05.522
And you and I and Justin

1:12:05.655 --> 1:12:07.557
are going to crush
this cattle drive.

1:12:07.691 --> 1:12:08.992
The city slickers

1:12:12.061 --> 1:12:13.329
All right.

1:12:13.463 --> 1:12:15.832
We are going to show them
how it's done.

1:12:15.965 --> 1:12:16.633
We're doing it.

1:12:16.766 --> 1:12:17.967
Oh, we are doing it.

1:12:24.641 --> 1:12:27.644
[*****]

1:12:27.777 --> 1:12:30.614
You really think
they're ready for this?

1:12:30.746 --> 1:12:32.115
Ready as they'll ever be.

1:12:32.248 --> 1:12:33.517
Well, I'm here
if you need me.

1:12:33.650 --> 1:12:34.918
Appreciate that.

1:12:35.050 --> 1:12:36.219
Well, here they come.

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:40.924
[*****]

1:12:52.902 --> 1:12:54.270
I hear there's some cattle

1:12:54.404 --> 1:12:55.539
that need
driving out to pasture.

1:12:55.672 --> 1:12:57.206
You got that right.

1:12:57.340 --> 1:12:58.307
Y'all ready?

1:12:58.442 --> 1:13:00.243
Oh, we're more than ready.

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:01.511
Let's giddy-up and do this.

1:13:05.281 --> 1:13:09.719
[*****]

1:13:16.826 --> 1:13:20.964
[*****]

1:13:29.806 --> 1:13:34.544
[*****]

1:13:40.650 --> 1:13:45.555
[*****]

1:13:50.494 --> 1:13:54.731
[*****]

1:13:58.568 --> 1:13:59.835
Well, gang, you did it.

1:14:01.004 --> 1:14:02.606
Yes!

1:14:03.371 --> 1:14:04.608
Oh, um, do you think

1:14:04.741 --> 1:14:06.109
you could take
some more photos for us?

1:14:06.242 --> 1:14:07.511
Oh, why not.

1:14:11.314 --> 1:14:12.582
So this is where
the cattle will graze

1:14:12.716 --> 1:14:14.150
for the rest of the season?

1:14:14.282 --> 1:14:16.385
That's right.

1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:17.452
Then before the weather turns,

1:14:17.587 --> 1:14:18.888
we'll round 'em back up

1:14:19.022 --> 1:14:21.124
and bring 'em back
into the winter pasture.

1:14:21.257 --> 1:14:22.592
Hmm.

1:14:22.726 --> 1:14:23.860
Who's "we"?

1:14:25.061 --> 1:14:25.962
You mean Kat?

1:14:26.094 --> 1:14:27.030
Most likely.

1:14:29.599 --> 1:14:31.400
You know, I get
why you came out here.

1:14:31.535 --> 1:14:33.803
The whole
bachelorette getaway,

1:14:33.937 --> 1:14:37.139
showing Amber her mistake.

1:14:37.273 --> 1:14:40.043
But whatever your reasons were,

1:14:40.175 --> 1:14:41.811
you showed a real
go-get-'em spirit.

1:14:41.945 --> 1:14:43.046
Thanks.

1:14:43.179 --> 1:14:44.880
But I'm glad you took
a chance on us.

1:14:46.449 --> 1:14:47.951
Well...

1:14:48.084 --> 1:14:49.753
changing things up around here

1:14:49.886 --> 1:14:51.655
may not have turned out
to be such a bad thing.

1:14:52.556 --> 1:14:55.124
No. It's not.

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:59.128
And I think it might be time
that I made a few changes.

1:15:00.263 --> 1:15:03.933
So these changes...

1:15:04.067 --> 1:15:05.602
Any idea what they look like?

1:15:05.735 --> 1:15:07.003
I won't know

1:15:07.136 --> 1:15:08.838
until I set
my brush to the canvas.

1:15:09.839 --> 1:15:11.107
We'd better head back
before we miss lunch.

1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:12.175
Yeah.

1:15:24.888 --> 1:15:25.922
[Olivia] Where's Justin?

1:15:26.055 --> 1:15:27.791
He is saying goodbye to Daisy.

1:15:27.924 --> 1:15:29.392
I swear, he's going
to miss that horse

1:15:29.525 --> 1:15:30.994
something fierce.

1:15:31.127 --> 1:15:33.129
What about you?

1:15:33.262 --> 1:15:34.197
Oh, yeah.

1:15:34.330 --> 1:15:36.165
Toro was a great horse.

1:15:36.299 --> 1:15:37.567
He never steered me wrong.

1:15:37.701 --> 1:15:41.103
Yeah, I'm talking about Travis.

1:15:43.306 --> 1:15:44.641
-That's crazy.
-Is it?

1:15:44.773 --> 1:15:47.210
Because I see how you two
get all moon-eyed

1:15:47.343 --> 1:15:48.311
when you look at each other.

1:15:48.443 --> 1:15:49.946
He gets like that?

1:15:50.079 --> 1:15:51.781
Uh-huh.
And so do you.

1:15:52.949 --> 1:15:55.018
So, what are you
going to do about it?

1:15:56.318 --> 1:15:58.321
What do you mean?
There's nothing to do.

1:15:58.454 --> 1:16:00.023
We leave tomorrow, right?

1:16:00.156 --> 1:16:01.523
So?

1:16:01.657 --> 1:16:02.525
You could tell him
to come visit you.

1:16:02.659 --> 1:16:04.127
No.

1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:05.428
There is no way that man
is setting foot in the city.

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:07.096
Just promise me

1:16:07.230 --> 1:16:09.165
that you will tell him
how you feel before we leave?

1:16:09.298 --> 1:16:10.199
Oh, no, no.

1:16:10.333 --> 1:16:11.735
I can't do that.

1:16:13.169 --> 1:16:15.504
Yeah, um...

1:16:15.639 --> 1:16:16.539
of course you can.

1:16:16.673 --> 1:16:17.573
Because if you don't,

1:16:17.707 --> 1:16:19.041
it's just going to become

1:16:19.175 --> 1:16:20.143
one of those things
you complain about.

1:16:20.276 --> 1:16:21.477
But this time,

1:16:21.611 --> 1:16:22.912
I won't be there
to commiserate with you.

1:16:23.046 --> 1:16:24.013
So...

1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:26.582
go on.

1:16:26.716 --> 1:16:27.951
Now?

1:16:28.084 --> 1:16:29.719
Yeah. Now.

1:16:30.386 --> 1:16:31.921
Okay. Okay.

1:16:50.707 --> 1:16:53.109
What?

1:16:53.242 --> 1:16:55.111
You don't think
I have the guts?

1:16:56.279 --> 1:16:57.380
Fine.

1:16:57.513 --> 1:16:59.014
I'll show you.

1:17:04.452 --> 1:17:06.089
See?

1:17:06.222 --> 1:17:07.857
I can do it.

1:17:15.630 --> 1:17:18.234
So the day was a success.

1:17:18.367 --> 1:17:19.468
Yeah, sure was.

1:17:19.602 --> 1:17:21.737
You know,
I've really got to admit

1:17:21.871 --> 1:17:24.473
it was super-weird
having other people here.

1:17:24.607 --> 1:17:25.608
You know, outsiders,

1:17:25.742 --> 1:17:27.410
they really don't get all this.

1:17:27.543 --> 1:17:29.045
I was worried, too,

1:17:29.178 --> 1:17:31.547
but I would say

1:17:31.681 --> 1:17:33.782
it worked out even better
than I could have hoped.

1:17:33.916 --> 1:17:36.252
Well, I'm a little bit worried.

1:17:36.385 --> 1:17:38.521
About us.

1:17:38.654 --> 1:17:42.191
You know, it's always been
just me and you out here,

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:43.359
and after this week,

1:17:43.492 --> 1:17:44.894
I realized

1:17:45.028 --> 1:17:48.164
that it might not always be
that way, so...

1:17:48.297 --> 1:17:49.398
Look, I just want
to tell you

1:17:49.532 --> 1:17:50.366
that I care about you.

1:17:50.499 --> 1:17:52.101
A lot.

1:17:52.235 --> 1:17:55.603
And I've pictured a future
with you and I together,

1:17:55.739 --> 1:17:56.505
and I know we have
what it takes

1:17:56.639 --> 1:17:57.773
to make it work.

1:17:59.642 --> 1:18:03.179
I mean, we're not out here
for a week playing ranchers.

1:18:03.312 --> 1:18:04.612
We are ranchers.

1:18:04.748 --> 1:18:05.849
[bull grunting]

1:18:08.251 --> 1:18:11.120
Sorry. I was just saying
goodbye to Cyclone, so...

1:18:13.156 --> 1:18:14.323
Yeah.

1:18:16.925 --> 1:18:18.693
You know, I'm just going to go.

1:18:18.827 --> 1:18:19.996
Kat, wait.

1:18:20.129 --> 1:18:21.097
Uh...

1:18:23.499 --> 1:18:24.834
I don't know what to say,

1:18:24.968 --> 1:18:28.271
because for the first time
in my life...

1:18:28.404 --> 1:18:30.573
I don't know
what my future looks like.

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:32.241
I understand.

1:18:32.375 --> 1:18:34.243
And for what it's worth,

1:18:34.377 --> 1:18:35.544
no matter what happens,

1:18:35.678 --> 1:18:37.413
I'll always be
your right hand.

1:18:37.546 --> 1:18:38.581
[Travis] And my left.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:40.383
[Kat] That too.

1:18:44.387 --> 1:18:45.288
[Travis] All right.

1:18:49.458 --> 1:18:54.463
[*****]

1:18:55.498 --> 1:18:57.066
Hey.

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:58.835
I waited up for you
as long as I could.

1:18:58.968 --> 1:19:00.469
What happened?

1:19:00.603 --> 1:19:03.773
I know maybe there was
a bit of moon-eye going on,

1:19:03.907 --> 1:19:05.975
but it's not reality.

1:19:06.876 --> 1:19:08.878
Reality is Travis and Kat.

1:19:09.012 --> 1:19:10.379
Not me and Travis.

1:19:10.513 --> 1:19:12.415
And I know
that you've found a rancher,

1:19:12.548 --> 1:19:16.684
and you are going to live
happily ever after.

1:19:16.820 --> 1:19:18.287
I'm just going to go home,

1:19:18.421 --> 1:19:22.458
and I'm going to focus on
making some other changes.

1:19:22.591 --> 1:19:23.893
Like with my painting.

1:19:24.861 --> 1:19:26.162
Right?

1:19:28.664 --> 1:19:30.333
Now, let's get going.

1:19:35.704 --> 1:19:37.040
So remember,

1:19:37.173 --> 1:19:38.707
she likes her mane
conditioned twice a week,

1:19:38.842 --> 1:19:39.742
and her hooves
will need a polish

1:19:39.876 --> 1:19:41.344
at least every other day

1:19:41.477 --> 1:19:43.446
or else she starts feeling
a bit self-conscious.

1:19:43.579 --> 1:19:45.481
We'll make sure
to take good care of her.

1:19:45.614 --> 1:19:47.483
I'm going to miss her.

1:19:47.616 --> 1:19:48.550
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:19:48.684 --> 1:19:50.419
One more selfie.

1:19:52.621 --> 1:19:53.422
Thanks.

1:19:53.556 --> 1:19:54.858
No problem.

1:20:00.529 --> 1:20:02.731
So this is it.

1:20:02.866 --> 1:20:04.633
Yeah, heading back
to the Big Apple

1:20:04.767 --> 1:20:06.936
to lasso a cab home.

1:20:07.070 --> 1:20:09.105
Well, I'm sure you'll have
no problem,

1:20:09.237 --> 1:20:11.040
seeing as
you're a skilled rancher now.

1:20:11.174 --> 1:20:13.309
Hardly, but thanks.

1:20:15.411 --> 1:20:17.646
Well, I guess
we'd better get going.

1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:19.382
Yeah, of course.

1:20:22.251 --> 1:20:23.252
You forgot your book.

1:20:23.386 --> 1:20:25.121
It's yours.

1:20:25.254 --> 1:20:27.190
I don't have the gift.

1:20:27.323 --> 1:20:28.257
Well, you don't know
unless you try.

1:20:28.391 --> 1:20:29.925
Right.

1:20:36.232 --> 1:20:39.969
[*****]

1:20:41.237 --> 1:20:43.973
Well, time
to get back to work now.

1:20:54.317 --> 1:20:55.851
-Thanks, babe.
-Of course.

1:20:58.821 --> 1:21:01.257
Well, this is it.

1:21:01.389 --> 1:21:03.226
I'm off to the wild, Wild West.

1:21:03.359 --> 1:21:05.693
Well, at least you're not
a rookie anymore.

1:21:05.827 --> 1:21:07.396
I'm going to miss you.

1:21:07.530 --> 1:21:09.465
You know we're going to talk,
like, almost every day.

1:21:10.934 --> 1:21:12.101
You're going to be great.

1:21:13.602 --> 1:21:14.670
I know.

1:21:14.803 --> 1:21:17.139
So are you.

1:21:21.410 --> 1:21:23.146
-Love you.
-Love you more.

1:21:36.125 --> 1:21:40.996
[*****]

1:21:44.333 --> 1:21:48.504
[*****]

1:21:56.145 --> 1:22:00.483
[*****]

1:22:06.689 --> 1:22:11.160
[*****]

1:22:16.832 --> 1:22:20.436
[*****]

1:22:35.351 --> 1:22:38.554
Did you read the review
from our first guests?

1:22:38.687 --> 1:22:39.722
No.

1:22:39.855 --> 1:22:41.590
What'd they say?

1:22:41.724 --> 1:22:43.592
A lot of positive things.

1:22:43.726 --> 1:22:46.029
Especially that Olivia.

1:22:47.130 --> 1:22:50.398
In fact, she mentions you
quite a bit,

1:22:50.532 --> 1:22:55.404
about how you were the thing
that made her stay so special.

1:22:55.538 --> 1:22:56.672
Really?

1:22:56.805 --> 1:22:57.806
She said that?

1:22:57.940 --> 1:22:59.742
Of course she did.

1:22:59.875 --> 1:23:01.110
I mean, anyone could see

1:23:01.244 --> 1:23:03.779
how she came
into her own out here,

1:23:03.912 --> 1:23:05.681
with thanks to you.

1:23:05.814 --> 1:23:08.351
Look, I can see
since she left

1:23:08.484 --> 1:23:11.254
that you've been
keeping your head down,

1:23:11.387 --> 1:23:12.987
doing what you do.

1:23:13.121 --> 1:23:15.191
And I could let you be.

1:23:15.324 --> 1:23:18.561
But I don't think
that'll help you.

1:23:18.693 --> 1:23:22.431
So I'm kicking
you off the ranch.

1:23:22.565 --> 1:23:23.599
What?

1:23:23.732 --> 1:23:24.800
What do you mean?

1:23:24.933 --> 1:23:26.469
I mean that you seem to think

1:23:26.602 --> 1:23:28.171
you've got
everything you need right here,

1:23:28.304 --> 1:23:29.938
but you don't.

1:23:30.073 --> 1:23:31.407
Because what you need

1:23:31.540 --> 1:23:32.907
is to go on

1:23:33.041 --> 1:23:35.443
one of those adventures
you and your mom talked about.

1:23:35.577 --> 1:23:37.180
And head on out
to New York.

1:23:38.781 --> 1:23:40.883
You really think so?

1:23:41.016 --> 1:23:43.085
Well, she ain't
from Denver, is she?

1:23:44.153 --> 1:23:45.321
No.

1:23:45.454 --> 1:23:47.456
No, she most
definitely is not.

1:23:50.293 --> 1:23:51.260
Thanks, Dad.

1:23:51.394 --> 1:23:53.429
Don't mention it.

1:23:53.562 --> 1:23:54.263
Now go on. Git.

1:24:02.371 --> 1:24:03.606
And yeah, I was thinking
instead of Thai tonight

1:24:03.739 --> 1:24:05.174
that I would try
this new Indian place.

1:24:05.308 --> 1:24:06.842
Oh, dang.

1:24:06.975 --> 1:24:08.611
I miss takeout food so much.

1:24:08.744 --> 1:24:10.179
Ooh, can you take a photo
of your food

1:24:10.313 --> 1:24:11.347
and send it to me?

1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:12.281
Please?

1:24:12.415 --> 1:24:13.482
Yes, of course.

1:24:13.616 --> 1:24:14.916
"Dang"?

1:24:15.050 --> 1:24:16.219
Are you all country now?

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:20.123
Oh, and be careful with those.
They're originals.

1:24:25.228 --> 1:24:26.395
Dang.

1:24:27.963 --> 1:24:29.865
I've got to call you back.

1:24:29.998 --> 1:24:31.467
Liv?

1:24:32.501 --> 1:24:33.469
Liv?

1:24:35.771 --> 1:24:36.939
See, you've got to get
his attention.

1:24:37.072 --> 1:24:38.374
Like this.

1:24:45.214 --> 1:24:46.449
I guess you were right.

1:24:46.582 --> 1:24:48.717
I do not have a clue
what I'm doing

1:24:48.851 --> 1:24:49.752
now that I'm here.

1:24:50.853 --> 1:24:51.853
What are you doing here?

1:24:51.987 --> 1:24:56.125
Well, thing is...

1:24:56.259 --> 1:24:59.027
all those acres of land,

1:24:59.162 --> 1:25:00.896
they always felt...

1:25:01.029 --> 1:25:02.231
full...

1:25:02.365 --> 1:25:05.334
you know, of life.

1:25:06.602 --> 1:25:08.871
But then after you left...

1:25:09.004 --> 1:25:10.873
it just felt...

1:25:11.005 --> 1:25:12.441
empty.

1:25:13.976 --> 1:25:15.744
And I didn't know
what to do about it,

1:25:15.878 --> 1:25:19.415
so my dad told me
to get my butt out here.

1:25:19.548 --> 1:25:20.183
So...

1:25:20.316 --> 1:25:21.750
here I am.

1:25:22.851 --> 1:25:24.753
Here...

1:25:24.887 --> 1:25:26.555
here you are.

1:25:28.857 --> 1:25:31.093
Yeah, I get it.

1:25:31.227 --> 1:25:33.228
This feels totally off,
me being here,

1:25:33.362 --> 1:25:36.665
so, clearly,
I don't know what I'm doing,

1:25:36.799 --> 1:25:38.334
so...

1:25:38.467 --> 1:25:39.602
No. Travis, wait.

1:25:42.538 --> 1:25:43.772
The only thing off

1:25:43.906 --> 1:25:46.675
is how I've been feeling
since I got back.

1:25:46.809 --> 1:25:51.447
Because all this...

1:25:51.580 --> 1:25:52.815
it feels empty, too.

1:25:53.916 --> 1:25:55.584
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:25:56.985 --> 1:25:59.555
So what do we do-

1:26:00.889 --> 1:26:05.761
* It's the shelter
of your smile *

1:26:05.894 --> 1:26:10.233
* A kindness
and a welcome to belong *

1:26:11.234 --> 1:26:12.434
Wish I could do this all day,

1:26:12.568 --> 1:26:13.902
but we've got guests
coming tomorrow.

1:26:14.036 --> 1:26:16.339
I'm sure you've got it
all under control.

1:26:16.472 --> 1:26:17.840
Are you kidding?

1:26:17.973 --> 1:26:19.608
I still have to
sweep out my gallery.

1:26:19.742 --> 1:26:21.344
Then I have to finish
that painting of Daisy

1:26:21.477 --> 1:26:22.978
I promised Justin.

1:26:23.111 --> 1:26:24.513
Then we have to clean out
the chicken coop.

1:26:24.647 --> 1:26:26.148
Oh, and don't forget,

1:26:26.282 --> 1:26:26.982
Amber and Dylan
are coming in a week.

1:26:27.115 --> 1:26:27.850
All right.

1:26:27.983 --> 1:26:29.485
I'll let you go.

1:26:29.618 --> 1:26:30.619
I'll just drive those cattle
out to pasture myself.

1:26:31.853 --> 1:26:32.788
Huh.

1:26:32.921 --> 1:26:34.223
Maybe all that can wait?

1:26:34.357 --> 1:26:37.460
* And the yearning
to be found *

1:26:37.593 --> 1:26:42.298
