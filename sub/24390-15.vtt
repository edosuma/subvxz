"Along with Bravo, our client
made the mutual decision

the right decision

04:15.633 --> 04:17.633

- I will say this.

Thomas is funny, eccentric,

and then we've seen

04:25.367 --> 04:27.433
there's a side of him
that is not really him.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.233
There's a big part of him
that I really, really love,

04:30.266 --> 04:32.767

a little part that I don't.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
- Well, Kathryn, you and Thomas
have been posting

with the kids.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.433
- Yeah. We've been trying to
spend more time together

04:39.467 --> 04:41.300

moving in the right direction,

04:44.633 --> 04:47.400
- What is your feeling
about this investigation?

04:47.433 --> 04:50.667
- I'm not gonna comment until
I guess it's resolved, I think.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.600
But I'm gonna focus on
is just, you know, the children

04:52.633 --> 04:55.000
and, like, staying out of it.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.400
- He is being accused of

04:57.433 --> 05:00.266
raping the nanny,
is that correct?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.333
Yeah.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.200
You obviously knew this nanny.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.367
- Mm-hmm, she was with us
for about two years.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.367
- All I know is Thomas has
always been lovely to me.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.667
I know that he can be--
like what Shep--

05:09.700 --> 05:11.333
- Volatile.
- Yeah, very volatile.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.400
So, um,
I think, like everyone else,

05:14.433 --> 05:16.200
I just want
to stay out of it, really.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.400
- Okay, um...

05:17.433 --> 05:19.400
Ashley, Thomas' girlfriend,

05:19.433 --> 05:20.700
is gonna be joining us...

05:20.734 --> 05:23.033
- Yay.
[laughter]

05:23.066 --> 05:24.367
Can't wait.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.600
- She's very nervous
about coming out.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.266
- I'm sure.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.667
- She doesn't have
anything to be nervous about.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.367
We're not gonna--we're not
gonna shred her or anything.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.734
I want to hear
what she has to say.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.667
- Well, she didn't
call you a bad mother.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.066
- No, I know.
I know.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.500
- You know, there's been
an overwhelming response

05:39.533 --> 05:43.500

power playing out this season.

lied to, and dismissed."

05:50.333 --> 05:51.734
What changed, Naomie?

05:51.767 --> 05:55.233
- I actually think
a big part of it was Kathryn.

05:55.266 --> 05:56.633
In your recovery and everything,

05:56.667 --> 05:59.066
you were able to be a friend
to every--

05:59.100 --> 06:01.367
and so we all became
really close over the summer.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.533

06:03.567 --> 06:05.600

- No.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.266
- Never mind, just kidding.
- No, not "we."

06:07.300 --> 06:08.633
There was no need
for girl power.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.600
They all dated really good guys,

06:10.633 --> 06:12.567
and then they
turned into assholes.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.300

to speak now, child."

- Yeah.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.333
- We can roll it right now.

06:29.367 --> 06:32.533

you can speak.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.367

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
But anyway, I shouldn't have
said that. Sorry.

06:36.433 --> 06:38.266
- You can interpret it
however you want,

06:38.300 --> 06:40.533
but girl power's just, like,
standing up for your self-worth,

06:40.567 --> 06:42.400
knowing it,
and acting accordingly.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.333
- Well, at Shep's barbeque,
Naomie,

06:44.367 --> 06:47.367
you accused JD of being
a terrible husband.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.266
- You pretend to do, like,
the golden boy sh--.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.367

06:50.400 --> 06:51.633

06:51.667 --> 06:54.633
knows that you're
a complete piece of sh--.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.600
Liz wasn't really coming around
and going out or anything,

06:57.633 --> 06:59.467
so I didn't want JD to be
the only one

06:59.500 --> 07:01.133
to drive the narrative and say,
you know,

07:01.166 --> 07:03.567
"oh, well, Liz, I hope
she gets the help she needs."

07:03.600 --> 07:06.500
The reason Liz needs help
is because he sucks.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.533
- She wasn't there
to defend herself.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.467
- Exactly, and so--yeah.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.066
- Linda from Pittsburg said,

07:11.100 --> 07:13.333
"Although Naomie
may be right about JD,

07:20.033 --> 07:22.367
put with up something
that bothered me for so long.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.734
And that's why
I was so mean to Craig,

and I should have just--

07:26.100 --> 07:28.333
- Can we name one of those lies?
- Come...

07:28.367 --> 07:30.433

that I ever told Naomie.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.734
Just one.
- What you had for breakfast.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.133
- What time you woke up
in the morning.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.667
- What time you were
leaving the house.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.633
- We lived together.
Shep, I'm not asking you.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.600
I'm asking Naomie, name one lie
that I ever told you, ever.

07:38.633 --> 07:39.734
- You had said you were gonna

07:39.767 --> 07:41.367
take the bar--
- And I did.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.467
- Which I'm not trying
to beat a dead horse.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.066
- I did.
- You did, but--

07:44.100 --> 07:45.667
- All right, we're--
we're really getting into--

07:45.700 --> 07:47.066
- I, like, really don't miss--
- I'm just saying,

07:47.100 --> 07:48.467
let's not blanket stuff
by being like

07:48.500 --> 07:50.066
"the guys were lying"
because she cannot

07:50.100 --> 07:52.033
name one lie I ever told her
'cause I never lied to her.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.100
- Um, okay, well,
we're talking about JD.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.767
Chelsea, you called JD
a con artist, why?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.367
- I hear a lot of things about

07:59.400 --> 08:02.100
him and his bar
that he used to have

08:02.133 --> 08:04.734
and the late nights that
he had there with young women.

08:04.767 --> 08:09.033
But then he comes across
as this sweet family man and...

08:09.066 --> 08:11.600
- JD has always had a bit of
a reputation in Charleston

08:11.633 --> 08:13.667
that we all have known about.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.066
Would you agree?
Yes?

08:16.100 --> 08:17.667
So, not surprised.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.200
- I think that for me--
not defending, you know,

08:20.233 --> 08:22.166
any of his actions, or,
you know, taking his side--

08:22.200 --> 08:25.467
but it was like, I think
that I want more, you know,

08:25.500 --> 08:27.700
evidence before I just
roast him at the spit.

08:27.734 --> 08:30.400
- Maddie from Atlanta said,
"Kathryn, your comments

08:30.433 --> 08:33.567
"on the good ol' boys era
dying are brilliant.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.133
Welcome to 2018, gentlemen.
Your time is up."

08:37.166 --> 08:38.700
- [clicks tongue]
- How does it feel

08:38.734 --> 08:41.033
to finally have your voice
heard this season?

08:41.066 --> 08:42.600
- Really wonderful.

08:42.633 --> 08:45.033
You know, Thomas definitely
put some things out there.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.633
And I wish people
would have, like, realized

08:46.667 --> 08:48.600
how the good ol' boy
system works,

08:48.633 --> 08:50.633
which is
painting the woman as crazy

08:50.667 --> 08:53.100
therefore any actions,
if they were to come out

08:53.133 --> 08:55.767
and say them,
that they'd be discredited.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.467
- Naomie, there seemed to be
an interesting turn of events

08:58.500 --> 09:00.433
that happened
after the episode aired.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.033
Liz attacked you on Twitter.
She said...

09:10.533 --> 09:13.133
"She is making allegations
about JD and my family

09:13.166 --> 09:14.533
"that are not true!

09:14.567 --> 09:17.600
This hurt me more
than I can express."

09:17.633 --> 09:19.166
- Does JD have her password

09:19.200 --> 09:20.467
or something,
to get on her Twitter account?

09:20.500 --> 09:21.700
- [laughs]

09:21.734 --> 09:23.100
- Naomie tweeted back...

09:30.567 --> 09:32.700
- No, she knew 100%.

09:32.734 --> 09:34.767
I mean, we would literally
laugh on the phone together

09:35.000 --> 09:36.467
after she'd be like,
"Oh, my God,

09:36.500 --> 09:37.734
"I can't wait
to see his face," you know.

09:37.767 --> 09:39.667
I think that
when it all did come out

09:39.700 --> 09:41.066
and she realized
the attention it was getting,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.500
she kind of backtracked
a little.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.567
- I think, you know,
he's controlling of Liz.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.033
I think he intimidates
her into doing things

09:47.066 --> 09:50.133
and being loyal to him,
and it's really sad to see.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.033
- Naomie, what is
the current status

09:52.066 --> 09:53.166
of your relationship with Liz?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.633
- We don't speak.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.500
- Ladies, how did
the current climate

09:57.533 --> 09:59.533
of what's going on
in this country

09:59.567 --> 10:02.133
influence your attitude
this season?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.567
Did it?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.100
- I mean, I think it's
definitely influenced

10:05.133 --> 10:07.767
what has happened with
Thomas recently in the news.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.066
I mean, that's why these women
are coming forward now.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.433
- Every man in America
did, like, a mental "take stock"

10:13.467 --> 10:15.734
of their--the last, like,
20 years of their life.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.600
Like, was that okay?
Is this okay?

10:17.633 --> 10:20.734
- Well, Chelsea had kind of
a bad experience with you.

10:20.767 --> 10:23.533
- Yeah.
True.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.734
Tried to kiss her.
I felt terrible about it.

10:25.767 --> 10:27.233
And I told her that,
and I apologized, and

10:27.266 --> 10:28.633
we're in a--I mean we're great.
- Yeah.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.133
- Do you think
there's been a shift

10:30.166 --> 10:31.734
in your sense of entitlement?
- Yeah.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.133
- If I told you that I--
I don't think about it more,

10:34.166 --> 10:35.600
I totally do.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.266
- Cameran,
now that you have a daughter,

10:37.300 --> 10:39.033
do you look at the antics of

10:39.066 --> 10:41.200
some of your male friends
any differently?

10:41.233 --> 10:43.467
- I do.
Um.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.500
I don't know if I would let--
well, I'm trying to think.

10:45.533 --> 10:47.500
Who would I let Palmer date
on this couch?

10:47.533 --> 10:49.066
- You said you would
let her date Shep.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.700
- Yeah, you said that Shep
was gonna marry Palmer.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.667
- No, Shep said he wanted
to date one of her friends.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.467
- That's a joke.
That's a joke.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.233
- But I am curious,
since you raised the question,

10:56.266 --> 10:58.200
if you had to pick
one of these three guys

10:58.233 --> 10:59.467
for Palmer to date?

10:59.500 --> 11:00.633
- I would pick Austen.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.734
- I would--yeah.
- Why?

11:02.767 --> 11:04.600
- He's the only one
that would date a two-year-old.

11:04.633 --> 11:07.066

11:08.700 --> 11:10.667
Did your husband go to
any of the birthing classes?

11:10.700 --> 11:12.767

- Oh, my God.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.266

11:18.433 --> 11:19.100

- What do you want to do,
um, hair-wise?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.667

to do this thing,

11:22.700 --> 11:24.133
this hair-flipping thing.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.166

it was just so earnest.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.500
And he goes to this trouble.

15:19.533 --> 15:21.333
It--it never comes to fruition.

15:21.367 --> 15:24.000
But he still felt
that he needed to give me

15:24.033 --> 15:25.333
the pieces...
- Right, right, right.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.066
- ...of the bear.
- 'Cause I tried.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.033
- Craig, what was your reaction
when you saw it?

15:29.066 --> 15:31.266
- That I can never remember why
I'm friends with these people.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.500
[laughter]
But, um...

15:32.533 --> 15:34.100
- He was showing me
that he tried.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.333
- That I tried.
And it was a way more--

15:35.367 --> 15:37.200
way more difficult
than I thought.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.500
- He had tried. But I think this
represents a bigger picture.

15:38.533 --> 15:40.233
- I can sew in 2-D, not 3-D.

15:40.266 --> 15:41.767
It's why--
I mean, it's difficult.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.100
So I didn't know
how to sew the arm on.

15:43.133 --> 15:44.333
- Andy, he's being serious.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.133
Like you're--
he's being dead serious.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.367
- It would be like why I
couldn't make a suit right now.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.567
'cause I can do 2-D,
but like--[stammers]

15:49.600 --> 15:52.233
- So then why do it?
Why half-ass a gift

15:52.266 --> 15:53.767
and then say, "But here you go"?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.066
- I didn't half-ass it.
I tried hard as sh--.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.400
I was trying to
make the teddy bear

15:57.433 --> 15:59.400
and--and I used
an advanced pattern

15:59.433 --> 16:01.133
and I should have
started with a beginner pattern

16:01.166 --> 16:02.400
because I couldn't follow it.

16:02.433 --> 16:03.400
- Well, all that matters
is that Cam thought

16:03.433 --> 16:04.600
that it was a sweet gesture.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.400
- Karen from Toronto said,

16:06.433 --> 16:09.367
"Cameran comes across as
a little emotionally detached

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
"when talking about
the birth of her daughter.

16:11.433 --> 16:14.266
I can't help but think she
doesn't really dig motherhood."

16:14.300 --> 16:17.100
Did you suffer from
postpartum depression?

16:17.133 --> 16:19.500
- I--I don't know if
I had postpartum depression.

16:19.533 --> 16:22.133
If I didn't, I was
definitely on the verge.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.400
I cried probably every day.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.000
Maybe I was.
I don't know.

16:25.033 --> 16:26.266
I was never diagnosed with it.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.066
Like, I never sought help or...

16:28.100 --> 16:30.333
- What were you crying--
what was the impetus for crying?

16:30.367 --> 16:32.367
- Um, it just...
- Like looking at the baby?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.100
- No, it's--it's, um,
it's everything.

16:35.133 --> 16:36.367
- It's a shock to your system.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.567
Your life is just
forever different.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.400
But I would say
in the last couple months,

16:41.433 --> 16:43.400
it's become real to me, and

16:43.433 --> 16:46.400
I feel, like, a genuine,
overwhelming love

16:46.433 --> 16:48.633
that I--I didn't feel it
immediately.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.266
When they put her in my arms,

16:50.300 --> 16:53.367
it was not this instant
connection.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.667
- Did you feel the same way?

16:54.700 --> 16:56.467
- No, I broke down in tears
when I saw Kensie.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.166
- Yeah, she did.
She had

16:58.200 --> 16:59.367
a much different experience.
- Oh, yeah.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.233
- I've heard that
from other mothers.

17:01.266 --> 17:02.667
I mean, that's fairly normal.
- Everyone's different.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.433
- I think a lot of people
don't want to admit it

17:04.467 --> 17:06.233
because they're afraid
it's gonna make them...

17:06.266 --> 17:08.433
- Look bad.
But it's--it's--

17:08.467 --> 17:11.233
it's not the same for everybody,
I don't think.

17:11.266 --> 17:13.233
- You posted something
pretty provocative

17:13.266 --> 17:15.033
on social media
about breastfeeding.

17:15.066 --> 17:16.200
- Yeah.
- You said...

17:21.100 --> 17:23.300
"I'm not quitting because
my milk supply dried up

17:23.333 --> 17:25.133
or because I'm sick...
I'm quitting

17:25.166 --> 17:28.333
because I am plain over it.
By choice."

17:28.367 --> 17:30.100
- I've received bad comments,

17:30.133 --> 17:32.066
but I would say
the overwhelming majority

17:32.100 --> 17:34.500
is women that say, Oh, my God,
I felt the same way,

17:34.533 --> 17:37.600
and I felt pressured by society
to continue doing this,

17:37.633 --> 17:39.700
even though it was
making me depressed.

17:39.734 --> 17:41.467
And I think when it--

17:41.500 --> 17:44.166
- When it's at the sake
of your mental health,

17:44.200 --> 17:46.200
I think the mental health
of the mother

17:46.233 --> 17:48.200
is far more important than

17:48.233 --> 17:50.066
the extra nutrition
it gives the baby.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.100
And if it's at
the sake of your mental health,

17:52.133 --> 17:54.400
quit it and give it--
give the baby formula.

17:54.433 --> 17:57.367
- And, yeah, I think
parents, women

17:57.400 --> 18:00.166
have this standard where
you have to be this perfect mom.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.433
Everything is like...
- Organic.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.633
- Non-GMO and, you know,
"I'm doing fine."

18:03.667 --> 18:05.467
Like, in all ways of life.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.600
- Is the pressure in Charleston
intense to be a perfect mom?

18:08.633 --> 18:10.367
- I think it's more so
in the South,

18:10.400 --> 18:11.667
because women, you know,

18:11.700 --> 18:13.533
you're expected
to live up to this

18:13.567 --> 18:15.367
thoughts, expectations of,
you know,

18:15.400 --> 18:17.233
you have the white picket fence
and the husband

18:17.266 --> 18:19.567
and the two perf--
you know, the boy and the girl.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.266
And it's just like
it's never good enough.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.500
- What is the best
piece of advice

18:22.533 --> 18:23.700
you have for new moms?

18:23.734 --> 18:25.200
- [sighs] Oh, God.

18:25.233 --> 18:26.734
Accept help.
- Accept help.

18:26.767 --> 18:29.166
- I wish I had
accepted more help with her,

18:29.200 --> 18:30.567
'cause as a mom
you need a break.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.367
You do.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.533
- All right, on that note,
we'll be right back.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.233
Coming up...

18:36.266 --> 18:39.200
- It is so sad to me,
your life.

18:39.233 --> 18:40.333
- Is that why you're still
sending me

18:40.367 --> 18:41.667
mean Instagram messages?

18:41.700 --> 18:43.333
- Only when you had
your new boy with my cat.

18:43.367 --> 18:45.200
I said "You're awful."
- Your cat?

18:45.233 --> 18:46.400
- Because you crossed the line.
You crossed the line.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.333
- I do think this needs to be...

18:51.667 --> 18:53.033
- I just want to tweak this...
- Yeah.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.533
There's something--yeah.
- Slightly.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.000
There's just kind of like...
- Yes, right.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.333
- They look like my...
- Exactly. No.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.467
Or maybe I should just
hold them out?

19:00.500 --> 19:03.600
I'm looking forward to this
being over.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.734
- Back with
the "Southern Charm" reunion.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.367
I'm Andy Cohen.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.033
After breaking up with Naomie,

19:09.066 --> 19:12.767
Craig went on a journey called
"Eat, drink, sew."

19:13.000 --> 19:15.400
Working with a life coach,
he tried to pursue

19:15.433 --> 19:17.033
his pillow passion

19:17.066 --> 19:19.400
until he stabbed himself
with a butter knife.

19:19.433 --> 19:20.700
[soft chuckling]

19:20.734 --> 19:22.567
Okay, a lot to unpack here.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.767
Craig, I don't understand

19:26.000 --> 19:27.667
the butter knife incident.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700
I'm assuming you were drunk.

19:29.734 --> 19:31.300
- Uhh, I don't know.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.467
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.000
- You don't know?
Come on. Okay.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.567
- We were taking down
this wall, so I was

19:35.600 --> 19:37.533
letting people
take power tools to the wall.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.600
And everyone's like, "This is
the craziest late night ever.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.300
No one else lets us do this."

19:40.333 --> 19:41.567
And there was a butter knife
on the table.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.300
So I went to stick it
in the wall.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.667
But the house is older
so it has

19:44.700 --> 19:46.500
wooden paneling
behind the dry wall,

19:46.533 --> 19:48.400
so it hit that.
- It has studs.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.633
- And so it stopped
and my hand kept going.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.100
- His finger--
look at his finger still.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.400
- Yeah, is your finger
permanently...

19:53.433 --> 19:54.533
- No, his fingers...
- Guys...

19:54.567 --> 19:55.700
- Oh, my God.
- Can you not...

19:55.734 --> 19:57.266
- Still crooked.
- A clubbed pinky.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.066
- Wait.
- So the joint stuck.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.700
And they don't want to
go in and un-pop it

20:00.734 --> 20:02.633
because of the scar tissue
so I just have to--

20:02.667 --> 20:05.033
I wear something at night
and go to physical therapy.

20:05.066 --> 20:07.633
- All over a knife
and a dry wall. [chuckles]

20:07.667 --> 20:10.066
- Cameran, you were skeeved out
by Craig's house.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.500
- Have you swept the floor
since you moved in?

20:13.533 --> 20:15.467
You could, like,
hire a cleaning service.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.567
I was in shock.
I mean, it was a mess.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.333
- Naomie, was he this messy
when you two were together?

20:20.367 --> 20:22.567
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, he was.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.567
- I believe I've asked you this
question at several reunions...

20:24.600 --> 20:26.700
- Messy's different than dirty.

20:26.734 --> 20:28.333
- Now that you have
passed the bar,

20:28.367 --> 20:31.433
any plans on practicing law?

20:31.467 --> 20:33.033
- So I'm actually
an attorney now.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.500
And at this point,
my goal is to do

20:36.533 --> 20:39.700
about 20 or 30 hours at the
pro bono clinic in Charleston.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.533
- I like his pillow work,
frankly.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.533
Maybe you could be
a pillow litigator.

20:43.567 --> 20:45.333
- Honestly, I don't give a sh--
what they think.

20:45.367 --> 20:46.367
- Th--yeah.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.433
- It's really cool because

20:47.467 --> 20:48.767
it's free legal work for them

20:49.000 --> 20:50.467
and I feel like
I'm good at what I do.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.100
It'll be a good way
to get my feet wet.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.633
- Austen, Craig told you
his life would be a lot easier

20:54.667 --> 20:56.066
if he was gay.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.600
- It makes me want to go back
and be like,

20:57.633 --> 20:59.567
"Hey, any chance
you can make me like guys?

20:59.600 --> 21:00.734
Just make me gay."

21:00.767 --> 21:04.467
Maybe my life would be
a little easier.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.000
- I was like,
Oh, my God, please

21:06.033 --> 21:07.400
let Craig be coming out to me
right now.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.734
I would love that
more than anything.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.734
Just be yourself, Craig.
We'll all support you.

21:11.767 --> 21:15.066
- We're ready to welcome you.
[laughter]

21:15.100 --> 21:17.667
[stammers]
Will I be your first call?

21:17.700 --> 21:19.100
- Yeah, you would.
- Okay.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.166
- Maybe I'll make
a pillow that says,

21:20.200 --> 21:21.734
"Straight guys can sew too."

21:21.767 --> 21:23.166
- Yeah.
- Aww, that's cute.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.500
- Well, listen...
- I'll make a shirt.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.400
- "Real Men Watch Bravo."
- Yeah.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.633
- What is it about sewing
that tickles your fancy?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.734
- So I need an outlet.

21:30.767 --> 21:33.767
And for a while it was
gardening and my workshop,

21:34.000 --> 21:35.400
but I had to
leave both of those behind

21:35.433 --> 21:37.500
when I moved out of
Naomie's house.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.533
You know, obviously
when you break up with someone

21:39.567 --> 21:41.533
that you thought you were gonna
spend the rest of your life with

21:41.567 --> 21:43.166
your brain's kind of going nuts.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.066
So it all comes down to
creation.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.467
Creating something,
I get a high off that.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.633
And then it made me forget
about her for a little bit.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.066
So I kept doing it.
And I was good at it and...

21:52.100 --> 21:53.533
So I had my sewing machine...

21:53.567 --> 21:55.767
- But you just had
a sewing machine? Why?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.200
- It was in the middle of
the living room for a long time.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.000
- Is that normal for someone,
just have it?

22:00.033 --> 22:01.767
- Why is it not normal?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.200
- So, Craig, Pat gave you an
amazing opportunity this season

22:04.233 --> 22:07.734
to work with her company
to design a pillow.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.500
But you really blew it.

22:09.533 --> 22:12.033
- You know, I'll start
playing around with things more.

22:12.066 --> 22:13.600
- It's been two months.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.400
I think we have to table it.

22:16.433 --> 22:18.500
- I bit off a little more
than I could chew.

22:18.533 --> 22:20.533
And I just put it off
because I never thought

22:20.567 --> 22:22.433
I would have the time
to make it good enough.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.600
And then when the time came,

22:24.633 --> 22:26.133
yeah, I was held accountable
for it.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.000
And that was, uh,
definitely a lesson.

22:28.033 --> 22:31.667
- You believe deadlines
are arbitrary.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.567
- I think people
are controlled by things.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.734
And I--I'm not controlled
by other people.

22:35.767 --> 22:38.500
And I think deadlines
are verbalized by

22:38.533 --> 22:41.567
other human beings, so
they're telling you what to do.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.166
And my brain just
doesn't work that way.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.000
And it's something that
I'm working on, because--

22:45.033 --> 22:46.533
- No one dies
if you don't meet it.

22:46.567 --> 22:49.133
They just wanted it then.
- Oh, man.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.533
- Nothing happened when Patricia
didn't get the design then.

22:51.567 --> 22:53.734
It was just to prove
that I could get it done--

22:53.767 --> 22:55.166
- Well, yeah, you didn't
sell the pillows

22:55.200 --> 22:56.166
and you lost a job.
- No-no-no.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.767
- [soft laugh]

22:58.000 --> 22:59.233
- It's art and commerce.

22:59.266 --> 23:01.200
If your art is a pillow

23:01.233 --> 23:03.033
and you're making it to sell,

23:03.066 --> 23:06.033
then you can't say I'm
gonna wait until I'm inspired

23:06.066 --> 23:08.700
and it may be three years from
now to sell a ----ing pillow.

23:08.734 --> 23:10.467
- I am how I am.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.633
It's just because without that,
someone bleeding,

23:12.667 --> 23:15.667
then actually it doesn't matter
if I give it to you tomorrow.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.667
- You literally have no idea
what you're talking about ever.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.533
Deadlines are not arbitrary.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.233
Like, you have to
pay your taxes on time.

23:22.266 --> 23:24.600
Like, I still get
IRS notices sent to my house

23:24.633 --> 23:26.166
'cause he hasn't
changed his address.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.667
- Well, Craig,
your lack of follow-through

23:28.700 --> 23:31.000
was one of the main reasons that

23:31.033 --> 23:35.700
Naomie didn't want to be in
a relationship with you, right?

23:35.734 --> 23:38.133
- There's never been
a reason that we broke up.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.734
And you can search
your whole life for what we had.

23:41.767 --> 23:45.066
And then for someone
to give that up for no reason...

23:45.100 --> 23:47.100
- It seems to me that
she did have a reason.

23:47.133 --> 23:48.667
- Yeah, it's not attractive
to come home...

23:48.700 --> 23:50.166
- Yeah.
- No, hold on--

23:50.200 --> 23:51.567
- ...every day after, like,
working hard

23:51.600 --> 23:53.200
and trying to
work towards something--

23:53.233 --> 23:55.066
- You weren't working hard.
You were at school.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.300
- That's literally not true.
- That's still working hard.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.734
- Love's unconditional--

23:57.767 --> 23:59.200
it all comes down to
love's unconditional.

23:59.233 --> 24:01.066
Everything you're saying
could be true.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.667
But it doesn't matter
when you love someone.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.166
You could have been
a heroin addict--

24:04.200 --> 24:05.567
- But I'm saying
it did matter to her.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.200
- But that's not love.
That's not love.

24:07.233 --> 24:08.266
She could have been
a heroin addict,

24:08.300 --> 24:09.700
and I wouldn't have left her.

24:09.734 --> 24:11.233
- Can't you want more
for your partner?

24:11.266 --> 24:13.300
- You can, but you can't
just cut off the love.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.700
- I think you have, like,

24:14.734 --> 24:16.633
romanticized this in your head--
- No.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.567
- And I really think that you're
on a different planet right now.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.000
- Then why did you track me
after we broke up

24:20.033 --> 24:21.266
and all the other
crazy sh-- you did?

24:21.300 --> 24:23.100
- Because I still
wasn't over it.

24:23.133 --> 24:24.767
- You're still searching for
a reason that we broke up.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.300
- Jesus, let me talk--
- [indistinct] broken up.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.200
- Please, you're just, like,
talking over me.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.700
- No, I was actually...
- And I don't miss this at all.

24:29.734 --> 24:31.266
Really, because
this is how it always was.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.633
- I can't even--I don't
even look at you anymore

24:32.667 --> 24:34.600
'cause I can't stand--
I can't--

24:34.633 --> 24:39.734
my--it is so sad to me,
your life.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.600
I feel so bad for you.

24:41.633 --> 24:43.133
And that's why I can't
even look at you--

24:43.166 --> 24:44.767
- I have literally
never been happier in my life.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.233
- And that's a lie.
- And I have nothing to prove

24:46.266 --> 24:48.100
to you--
- That's why you post pictures.

24:48.133 --> 24:50.100
That's your life, is to convince
Instagram that you're happy.

24:50.133 --> 24:51.233
- Is that why you're still
sending me

24:51.266 --> 24:52.700
mean Instagram messages?

24:52.734 --> 24:54.200
- Only when you had your new boy
with my cat,

24:54.233 --> 24:55.734
I said "You're awful."
- [stifled laugh]

24:55.767 --> 24:57.300
- Because you crossed the line.
- Your cat?

24:57.333 --> 24:59.266
- You crossed the line.
- Z is not your cat.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.166
- That's not still sending--
we hadn't talked in 8 months.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.166
I sent one thing saying
"You're awful" because you are.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.567
- [laughs] What a jackass.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.233
- Isn't it her right
to post a picture

25:06.266 --> 25:08.533
of someone she's dating?
- She can do whatever she wants.

25:08.567 --> 25:10.233
- Then what's your issue?
- I don't have an issue.

25:10.266 --> 25:11.700
She just said she's
never been happier,

25:11.734 --> 25:13.300
and I don't believe her,
'cause I know she said--

25:13.333 --> 25:15.066
told someone last night
that she's not happy.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.333
- Listen, Craig and I
obviously understand each other

25:16.367 --> 25:18.133
very well, so he knows
what makes me happy.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.667
- She told someone last night,

25:19.700 --> 25:21.567
and I'm sorry that
I'm spilling this,

25:21.600 --> 25:24.100
that she was like, "Oh,
you know that feeling you get

25:24.133 --> 25:25.700
"when you first meet someone?
[tsks]

25:25.734 --> 25:28.133
Yeah, I don't really have
that anymore with this guy."

25:28.166 --> 25:29.266
- Who--wait, what?

25:29.300 --> 25:32.266
[dramatic music]

25:32.300 --> 25:34.133
- Coming up...

25:34.166 --> 25:36.100
- I didn't admit
that I actually lied

25:36.133 --> 25:38.166
or manipulated people;
I said I'm good at it.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.066
- The life coach w--
face told me another story.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.367
- Isn't it her right to post a

25:45.367 --> 25:46.100
- Isn't it her right to post a
picture of someone she's dating?

25:48.033 --> 25:50.433
- She can do whatever she wants.
- Then what's your issue?

25:50.467 --> 25:52.233
- She told someone last night,

25:52.266 --> 25:53.734
she was like, "Oh,
you know that feeling you get

25:53.767 --> 25:55.467
"when you first meet someone?
[tsks]

25:55.500 --> 25:58.266
Yeah, I don't really have
that anymore with this guy."

25:58.300 --> 26:00.133
- Who--wait, what?
That I said that?

26:00.166 --> 26:02.000
- Yeah...
- That is completely made-up!

26:02.033 --> 26:03.200
Are you out of your mind?

26:03.233 --> 26:04.467
- Are you dating
someone right now?

26:04.500 --> 26:06.066
- Kathryn, did you say something
to him?

26:06.100 --> 26:07.266
[indistinct talking]
- I like him.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.266
- What did you just say?
- It did happen.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.133
- What?
- Thank you.

26:11.166 --> 26:12.367
Her whole life's a lie.
- You did say that, remember?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.233
We were at the bar thing
at the hotel.

26:14.266 --> 26:16.333
- Am I in the twilight zone?
- Her whole life is a lie.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.000
Her whole life's a lie.
- I'm sorry, wait--

26:18.033 --> 26:19.734
what did I say?
You're saying that I said what?

26:19.767 --> 26:22.100
- We were talking about, like,
when you first meet someone,

26:22.133 --> 26:24.400
you kind of, like, have
this admiration for them, right?

26:24.433 --> 26:26.333
- I was referring to Craig.
- Bullsh--.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.333
Your whole life's a lie.
Live for yourself--

26:28.367 --> 26:30.066
- Craig, I literally like--
- Craig, Craig...

26:30.100 --> 26:31.400
- What did you say?
- My whole life is a lie.

26:31.433 --> 26:33.734
I had to get away from you,
because instead of--

26:33.767 --> 26:35.333
- That is so untrue!
- Absurd, Craig.

26:35.367 --> 26:36.700
- She thinks
your whole life is a lie.

26:36.734 --> 26:38.133
- Kathryn, I am
obsessed with Metul.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.400
That is so untrue.
- That's fine.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.166
- Maybe I misunderstood,
I don't know.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.433
But I remember,
almost verbatim what was said.

26:42.467 --> 26:44.300
- Yeah, I would literally
never say that.

26:44.333 --> 26:47.000
I--[stammers] not at all for one
second was talking about Metul.

26:47.033 --> 26:48.233
- Okay, I guess
I misinterpreted it, 'cause

26:48.266 --> 26:51.033
I thought you said at the end...
- No.

26:51.066 --> 26:52.400
- You're afraid
that's what was happening.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.100
- No.

26:54.133 --> 26:56.300
- Okay, I want to
talk about the life coach.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.166
Craig, you admitted
to the life coach

26:58.200 --> 27:01.000
that you're a good liar
and a master manipulator.

27:01.033 --> 27:03.233
- I didn't admit
that I actually lied;

27:03.266 --> 27:04.500
I said I'm good at it.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.300
- The life coach face
told me another story.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.000
- I'm a great liar.

27:08.033 --> 27:10.533
[quirky music]

27:10.567 --> 27:14.066
What I was referring to was that

27:14.100 --> 27:16.767
I am inc--
[stammers]

27:17.000 --> 27:19.066
in the past, been incapable of

27:19.100 --> 27:20.734
holding myself accountable
of anything.

27:20.767 --> 27:23.200
And that's because
I can justify or excuse

27:23.233 --> 27:24.500
anything I'm doing.

27:24.533 --> 27:26.233
Which means I can
lie to myself and be like,

27:26.266 --> 27:27.767
well, it really doesn't matter
if you, like,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.300
cut the grass today or tomorrow,
there's no harm.

27:30.333 --> 27:33.133
And so unless
there was a severe consequence

27:33.166 --> 27:34.400
that someone else
was holding to me,

27:34.433 --> 27:36.333
I'm able to lie to myself
that it's not a--

27:36.367 --> 27:38.166
- But then you lie to others,
and they're little white lies

27:38.200 --> 27:40.033
and they don't hurt anybody
but they stack up.

27:40.066 --> 27:41.300
- Craig, I was just gonna say,
they're never big lies.

27:41.333 --> 27:42.467
They're never lies
that hurt anybody

27:42.500 --> 27:44.200
or that are meant
with ill intent.

27:44.233 --> 27:45.567
But they're these little--
they're stupid lies.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.166
- It's out of shame.
- They're stupid lies.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.333
- It's out of shame.
- They're stupid.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.033
- The lies I tell
are out of shame.

27:50.066 --> 27:52.100
- Did you see Laura
the life coach again?

27:52.133 --> 27:53.367
- Yeah, I talk to her
every week.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.367
- You do?
- Yeah, it's cool, you Skype.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.166
- Naomie, you don't look like
you're buying any of this.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.266
- No.
- Why?

28:00.300 --> 28:02.000
- I'm just not, I mean...

28:02.033 --> 28:03.233
- She will only ever be happy
and I hope she can--

28:03.266 --> 28:04.266
- I, like, I wish you the best,
but...

28:04.300 --> 28:05.367
- That all of this bad stuff

28:05.400 --> 28:07.100
was a real thing, 'cause then

28:07.133 --> 28:08.400
she'll be able to
sleep at night knowing that

28:08.433 --> 28:10.133
she didn't throw away one
of the best things

28:10.166 --> 28:11.200
that ever happened to her.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.500
That's how I honestly feel.

28:12.533 --> 28:14.300
- Well, we certainly saw
a different side

28:14.333 --> 28:15.500
of Naomie this season.

28:15.533 --> 28:17.467
From feeding on Craig's soul

28:17.500 --> 28:19.400
to stalking him all over town,

28:19.433 --> 28:22.567
Naomie has undergone
a real transformation,

28:22.600 --> 28:26.333
and I'm not just talking
about the new schnoz.

28:26.367 --> 28:28.166
And speaking of the schnoz,

28:28.200 --> 28:30.233
Naomie, why did you
get the nose job?

28:30.266 --> 28:32.633
You were like mini Barbara
to me.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.333
- You know...
- Was it something that

28:34.367 --> 28:36.200
you had talked about
for years, wanting to do?

28:36.233 --> 28:38.000
- Oh, since--
as long as I can remember--

28:38.033 --> 28:39.367
since I was like
eight years old.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.133
It's the nose
that I've always wanted.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.367
- Craig, you told me on
"Watch What Happens Live"

28:44.400 --> 28:46.533
that when you saw Naomie's nose

28:46.567 --> 28:48.400
for the first time,
you cried.

28:48.433 --> 28:49.467
- Yes.
- Why?

28:49.500 --> 28:51.200
- It's a physical representation

28:51.233 --> 28:53.200
of me losing the person

28:53.233 --> 28:55.300
I thought I was gonna have a
family and live my life with.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.266
She has turned into
an entirely different person,

28:57.300 --> 28:58.533
and I have no clue
who that person is.

28:58.567 --> 29:00.133
- How would you know?
We don't talk.

29:00.166 --> 29:02.533
- You got very mixed reaction...
- Yeah!

29:02.567 --> 29:04.600
- To poor reaction on
social media about the nose.

29:04.633 --> 29:07.533
- Yeah.
I was really unaffected by it,

29:07.567 --> 29:10.567
because I'm really happy
with the result, you know?

29:10.600 --> 29:12.400
- We always said
you couldn't see your beauty.

29:12.433 --> 29:14.033
Maybe that's why
I was heartbroken,

29:14.066 --> 29:16.100
because I thought
she was so beautiful...

29:16.133 --> 29:17.433
- Do you not think that
she's beautiful...

29:17.467 --> 29:19.033
- It's not about that.

29:19.066 --> 29:20.033
No, of course.
She still looks great.

29:20.066 --> 29:21.300
But it was about...

29:21.333 --> 29:22.667
- He's saying
he saw nothing wrong.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.166
- It was sad to know
that she looked in the mirror

29:24.200 --> 29:25.567
and didn't think
she was beautiful.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.100
That's what broke my heart.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.300
- I didn't think
I was like Quasimodo,

29:28.333 --> 29:29.567
but I just wanted a little tweak

29:29.600 --> 29:32.433
and I did it,
and, like, moving on, you know?

29:32.467 --> 29:34.533
- Naomie, another thing
we learned about you this season

29:34.567 --> 29:37.433
is that you suffer from
a condition known as

29:37.467 --> 29:40.433
"psycho ex-girlfriend" syndrome.
- Yeah.

29:40.467 --> 29:42.033
- Got a lot of tweets about

29:42.066 --> 29:44.133
your stalker-ish tendencies.
- Yeah.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.667
- Remember when you said
you had a tracker on Craig?

29:46.700 --> 29:48.266
- How do you do that?

29:48.300 --> 29:50.133
- You steal his phone
when he's asleep

29:50.166 --> 29:52.333
and you turn on location
indefinitely.

29:52.367 --> 29:54.433
- I love it!
- I'm crazy, y'all.

29:54.467 --> 29:56.600

when Naomie said

29:56.633 --> 29:58.500
"she took Craig's phone
while he was asleep so

29:58.533 --> 30:00.200
she could track his location."
- So--

30:00.233 --> 30:01.433
- "If a man did that to a woman,

30:01.467 --> 30:03.533
it would 100% be abuse."

30:03.567 --> 30:05.533
Craig, did you know
Naomie was tracking you?

30:05.567 --> 30:09.467
- Well, yeah, because the
whole story she told was a lie.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.200
- Everything
in her life's a lie.

30:11.233 --> 30:12.433
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, Naomie, but...

30:12.467 --> 30:14.133
- That's what
she said about you.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.333
- So we--our locations were on--
- Craig, stop.

30:16.367 --> 30:17.600
- Because we dated...
- You've lost your damn marbles.

30:17.633 --> 30:19.333
- We shared
each other's locations.

30:19.367 --> 30:20.567
She never got it--my phone
when I was sleeping.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.300
- No, they're like,
"How do you do that?

I was like, you take his phone
when he's sleeping--

30:23.567 --> 30:25.133

I didn't realize

30:25.166 --> 30:26.467
when she ended
her location sharing

30:26.500 --> 30:28.200

that it didn't end mine.

your location settings

30:30.467 --> 30:31.734
on your phones?
- For sure.

is weird to me.

if there's a world in which
you could

30:44.567 --> 30:46.633
ever get back together?
- No.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.633
- I'd love to date the person
I dated a year and a half ago,

30:48.667 --> 30:50.633
but it doesn't exist anymore,
so no.

30:50.667 --> 30:54.233

you might

30:54.266 --> 30:56.367
still be in love with her.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.734

I mean, we--

30:57.767 --> 30:59.533
we traveled the world together.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.166
We'll probably never find
what we had together again.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.567

I was so confused--

- How she--no-no--well--

31:06.166 --> 31:08.233
that's, I think, why
the nose job upset me so much.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.600
Because it was like
the final confirmation that...

31:09.633 --> 31:11.400
- Just say yes,
that you are, Craig.

31:11.433 --> 31:12.734
- No, I'm not in love.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.633
In love would mean
you want to get back together.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.166
you didn't have
a large support system,

36:01.200 --> 36:03.266

for you to trust people.

the same thing today?

36:09.633 --> 36:11.066

36:18.633 --> 36:20.734

36:20.767 --> 36:23.033

she was pretty much
still a child.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.166

advantage of her.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.100
I do, and I think
he manipulated her

37:00.133 --> 37:03.033
and also manipulated
a lot of us

37:03.066 --> 37:04.700
into being against her.

I think, just personally,
now that I'm a mother,

what she went through,

37:09.767 --> 37:12.734
