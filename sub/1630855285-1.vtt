05:02.650 --> 05:04.042
[ON PHONE] <i>Hello, Lizzy.</i>

05:05.261 --> 05:06.436
Hi, dad.

05:07.698 --> 05:10.005
My show opens Monday.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.921
That's a week from tomorrow.
Put it on your calendar.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.793
<i>Well, I don't think
I got an invitation.</i>

05:15.793 --> 05:17.534
<i>Unless it got lost
in the junk mail.</i>

05:17.534 --> 05:20.320
<i>So much junk mail
coming in all the time.</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:23.888
<i>Have you seen the fake
handwriting they have now?</i>

05:23.888 --> 05:25.977
<i>Looks like someone
really wrote it by hand.</i>

05:25.977 --> 05:28.197
Dad, this is your invitation.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.373
I haven't had time
to send anything out.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.375
<i>Uh, well, we'll all be there.</i>

05:32.375 --> 05:34.899
<i>My guests have come
wandering through again.</i>

05:34.899 --> 05:37.511
<i>They'd love to have an outing,
I'm sure.</i>

05:37.511 --> 05:39.469
I don't like that they're
staying with you again.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.818
<i>They like it here.</i>

05:40.818 --> 05:42.429
<i>It's a good spot
for them to stop.</i>

05:42.429 --> 05:43.865
They were just there.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.954
Don't they have anywhere else
they can stay?

05:46.911 --> 05:48.783
<i>I enjoy the company.</i>

05:51.133 --> 05:53.135
Feels like they're
taking advantage of you.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.267
<i>No. No. No.</i>

05:56.530 --> 05:57.879
I'm gonna stop by this week
and make sure

05:57.879 --> 06:00.534
they don't have you
tied up in the basement.

06:00.534 --> 06:04.276
<i>Nothing as exciting as that,
I assure you.</i>

06:04.276 --> 06:07.497
<i>Though that would
possibly be quite enjoyable.</i>

06:07.497 --> 06:09.151
<i>I could do without
their dog though,</i>

06:09.151 --> 06:11.327
<i>not a well-trained creature.</i>

06:11.327 --> 06:14.286
<i>Keeps mistaking the corner
of my couch for a tree.</i>

06:14.286 --> 06:15.723
Dad, that's gross.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.982
Hey Lizzy. Check it out.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.464
Been hoping to find

07:44.464 --> 07:46.814
a good tire for this tree
for ages.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.515
Jo, the water situation
is getting worse.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.908
Barely gets lukewarm now.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.737
Just a few minutes of lukewarm
and then cold.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.827
That sounds serious.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.353
I'm on it.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.706
Just got to get
through this week first.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.146
Shouldn't even be here
right now.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.626
I've got so much to do.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.280
I do, too. And I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

08:18.280 --> 08:19.542
without hot water.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.547
Lizzy, I told you,
you can use my shower.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.986
I want my own water working.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.642
My show's open on Friday.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.079
I'll be free to deal with it
after that.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.864
I have a show too, you know.
I'm just...

08:39.475 --> 08:41.738
You're not the only one
with a deadline.

08:42.913 --> 08:46.351
I know, but I have two shows
which is insane.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.495
Hey! Give me a push.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.461
You're hungry?

09:11.246 --> 09:12.987
Well, you have to wait.
You're out of food.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.946
I have to work.

09:15.946 --> 09:19.123
- I'll go to the store later.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.951
Fine.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.126
Ugh, shut up!

09:22.126 --> 09:25.086
God, Ricky,
you're ruining my workday.

11:21.419 --> 11:22.594
<i>This is Todd-a-phonic time.</i>

11:22.594 --> 11:24.248
<i>Happy Monday to you all.</i>

11:24.248 --> 11:26.555
<i>Counting the days
until the Quazi show</i>

11:26.555 --> 11:27.599
<i>on the roof of the...</i>

11:46.618 --> 11:47.663
Eric!

11:49.143 --> 11:50.753
Hey!

11:50.753 --> 11:53.016
A whole year of my life.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.104
Let's see it.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.683
I love it.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.119
What did you end up
doing with the zipper?

12:09.119 --> 12:12.296
Well, I abandoned
the zipper idea

12:12.296 --> 12:14.124
and went with Velcro.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.910
Which, like you said,
is not great...

12:16.910 --> 12:17.998
Come here, let me help.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.260
...because it sticks
to the yarn.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.870
Yeah, it gets
a little messy, but...

12:26.354 --> 12:27.442
Hey, Lizzy, can I get

12:27.442 --> 12:28.965
a little bit
of coffee, please?

12:28.965 --> 12:31.359
This isn't a cafeteria.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.839
Okay, but, like...

12:32.839 --> 12:35.145
Could you at least tell me
who's on my board?

12:36.146 --> 12:38.758
Hasn't been decided yet.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.803
Look, Randal,
he shouldn't be on my board.

12:40.803 --> 12:41.848
We don't see eye-to-eye.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.501
We got, like,
different theories

12:43.501 --> 12:44.764
of cultural production.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.202
Or he just doesn't like me.
I don't know.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.030
I'm just putting that
out there.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.077
Hey, man...
Hey.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.782
Big piece on Marlene Heyman.

13:06.873 --> 13:11.138
"...devotional, humble,
luminous and strange..."

13:11.138 --> 13:13.618
"She sees glass
as a religious vessel

13:13.618 --> 13:16.360
"for personal
mastic meditation."

13:17.535 --> 13:21.626
Wow, major real estate.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.280
"The dream like glass
would seem like..."

13:24.455 --> 13:25.717
Lizzy.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.591
Uh, let's get
the, uh, latest, um,

13:29.591 --> 13:31.898
end-of-year schedule
out today.

13:39.514 --> 13:40.515
Mmm.

13:42.691 --> 13:46.826
Oh, these are travel receipts
for our guests.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.437
And, um,
I gave Tim Hunter cash

13:49.437 --> 13:52.135
so the invoice is in there.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.761
Here you go.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.721
All right.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.476
Lizzy, you ready
to fire this week?

14:30.260 --> 14:33.481
Yeah, yeah.

14:33.481 --> 14:36.223
There'll be a few stragglers
though, is that okay?

14:36.223 --> 14:38.138
We'll make room.
Just bring by what you have.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.444
It's all right.
We'll make it work.

14:40.444 --> 14:43.926
Oh, I saw some of Jo's work
at her studio yesterday.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.276
Wow, it just gives me
such a lift.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.757
Pretty amazing.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.500
She'd be more amazing

14:52.500 --> 14:53.893
if she got
my hot water working.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.766
Two weeks now.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.811
Hey, Lizzy,
I've gotta get to class.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.901
Bring your stuff by.
We'll make it work.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.025
He's on
spherical mirrors...

15:40.113 --> 15:42.811
...groovy oil lamps.

15:44.595 --> 15:48.512
Media heat.
The heat of the technology.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.558
The human shadows.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.691
This mess of images.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.217
So, what does it all do?

16:01.047 --> 16:02.831
It blows our minds.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.009
Does somebody wanna go
on the inside?

16:07.009 --> 16:08.924
Grace? Maya?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.544
I'm not gonna lock you in.

16:23.939 --> 16:27.160
This one,
doesn't make me cringe.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.120
I had a special feeling
about this one.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.948
You know, it's, uh,

16:32.948 --> 16:35.820
it's right where
I wanted to be.

16:35.820 --> 16:40.347
Good form, but not too slick.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.047
There's spontaneity
in that pot.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.397
It's its own thing.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.887
You know you're meeting
with the dean at noon?

16:58.887 --> 17:02.673
- Yeah. Can you remind Jackie?
- She knows.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.240
And I was wondering
if it's okay

17:04.240 --> 17:06.590
if I take tomorrow off work?

17:06.590 --> 17:08.288
I was thinking
I might do that.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.377
I'd have a lot of work.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.552
For the show.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.038
So is that okay?

17:19.821 --> 17:21.301
If I don't come in?

17:21.301 --> 17:23.085
Lizzy, if you're taking
a personal day,

17:23.085 --> 17:25.000
you're taking a personal day.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.088
Okay, so I won't
be in tomorrow.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.089
I got it.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.662
And have you talked to Dad?

17:36.142 --> 17:38.579
Because those people are back
at his house again.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.146
What people?

17:41.669 --> 17:43.845
The people who stay with him.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.108
Well, your father
is living his own life.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.328
And we all wish him
the very best.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.591
Lizzy, I'm focusing here.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.553
I can't figure out
what class this is.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.686
But I really want to join it.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.214
Thinking and Movement.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.563
Ah.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.522
You're Lizzy, right?

18:52.522 --> 18:54.568
You made that nice flyer.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.314
I haven't gotten
to read the article yet,

19:01.314 --> 19:02.837
but I made the flyer.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.015
Cool.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.149
Well, thank you.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.455
I want to impress
those students.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.112
And the flyer was very nice.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.378
Thank you.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.945
Yeah, see you around.

19:37.741 --> 19:41.528
<i>...in store for us
and I can't wait to listen.</i>

19:41.528 --> 19:44.052
<i>But while I wait to listen,
let's listen to...</i>

19:45.836 --> 19:47.403
<i>This is, like, the, uh...</i>

19:47.403 --> 19:51.102
<i>Mike Bloomfield,
Al Kooper super session...</i>

22:27.215 --> 22:29.086
<i>Hey, you,
leave a message.</i>

22:31.915 --> 22:33.874
Hey, Sean, checking in.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.836
My show opens on Monday.
It's at Lauren's again.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.232
If you're not busy
maybe you'll come.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.714
Okay. Well...

22:48.802 --> 22:50.107
Talk to you later.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.240
Bye.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.001
Hey.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.394
Hey.

24:03.398 --> 24:04.878
They said they were doing
a catalogue

24:04.878 --> 24:06.140
and now they're like,

24:06.140 --> 24:09.143
"Oh, it won't be ready
before the opening."

24:09.143 --> 24:11.798
Only our school
would do that. God.

24:11.798 --> 24:14.670
Lame.
- So lame.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.630
Abigail Firschein
spotlight show.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.805
If there's no catalogue,

24:18.805 --> 24:20.937
it's just my thesis show
all over again.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.765
Who cares?

24:22.765 --> 24:25.289
It'll happen.
Things usually get done,

24:25.289 --> 24:28.554
just not on time.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.776
Yeah, we'll see.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.604
Oh, no. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

26:02.604 --> 26:04.258
- Ricky! No. No.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.520
No! Bad cat!

26:05.999 --> 26:07.348
Ricky! Ricky!

26:07.348 --> 26:10.090
- Bad cat, bad cat. Get out.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.484
Shit.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.140
Oh...

26:23.843 --> 26:26.367
Oh, you dumb bird.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.544
Ooh...

26:36.029 --> 26:38.422
Off you go.

26:38.422 --> 26:41.643
Go somewhere else.
Go die somewhere else.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.610
Jesus, I'm bad.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.787
Ricky, you are bad!

26:55.526 --> 26:56.527
Bad.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.259
Shit.

27:59.503 --> 28:00.679
Lizzy.

28:01.767 --> 28:02.898
Check it out.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.207
Found this poor bird.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.688
What?

28:10.819 --> 28:12.908
I found a bird. Check it out.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.308
Hey... Yeah...

28:22.091 --> 28:24.180
We're good. You're good.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.706
Oh, a pigeon.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.708
I think it was mauled
by a cat.

28:31.492 --> 28:35.278
It was flapping around
out back in the flowerbed.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.977
His wing is messed up.
Broken, I think.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.762
Poor little guy.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.198
Look at this guy.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.375
You're okay...

28:46.725 --> 28:48.248
Hold him a sec.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.389
I think it was Oscar
who did it.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.394
That cat is a menace.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.396
They really need
to keep him inside.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.757
Come on,
let's fix this guy up.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.758
Jo...

29:30.420 --> 29:32.118
I think this should be good.

29:33.597 --> 29:34.598
Yeah.

29:34.903 --> 29:35.904
Okay.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.604
Okay...

29:50.005 --> 29:51.354
Does that look good?

29:52.878 --> 29:54.140
I think so.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.057
Okay, we need a box.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.637
Okay... Wait.

30:22.733 --> 30:23.865
Okay.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.390
All right.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.923
Ah, the People Tower.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.099
I probably made
this Freshman year.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.971
That's a classic.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.161
Okay...

31:00.162 --> 31:01.772
There you go.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.559
Perfecto!

31:11.652 --> 31:13.697
What are we gonna
do with you, huh?

31:16.483 --> 31:19.312
What are we gonna do?

31:20.922 --> 31:22.054
I gotta get to work.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.925
Hey, Lizzy,
what are you doing today?

31:23.925 --> 31:25.927
Me?

31:25.927 --> 31:28.234
Working in the studio
from home. I got a lot to do.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.758
I have to install
at Nationale.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.760
Jo, I have a cat.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.155
Ricky is upstairs,

31:36.155 --> 31:38.548
the bird can hang with you
in the studio.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.681
I took today off to work.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.813
Aw, this guy is no trouble.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.424
Right?

31:46.600 --> 31:47.644
Yeah, I guess.

31:47.644 --> 31:51.170
Wow, super! You're amazing.

31:51.170 --> 31:54.390
I'll get him back from you
as soon as I get home.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.783
You're the best.

31:55.783 --> 31:56.827
Okay.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.011
- Oh, yeah,

32:06.011 --> 32:07.926
you've done enough already.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.039
Sorry.

36:17.610 --> 36:18.872
Gross.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.225
What's the matter?

37:11.316 --> 37:12.708
Why are you panting?

37:36.166 --> 37:37.951
<i>Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message.</i>

37:39.518 --> 37:42.390
Hi, Jo,
your bird is acting weird.

37:44.174 --> 37:45.915
I don't think
it's breathing right.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.353
Call me back.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.754
What, are you having
a heart attack or something?

38:16.119 --> 38:19.558
So much to do today, Mr. Bird,
you're not helping.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.824
<i>Jo, your bird
is acting weird.</i>

39:09.999 --> 39:11.784
<i>I don't think
it's breathing right.</i>

39:13.655 --> 39:14.830
<i>Call me back.</i>

39:28.191 --> 39:32.021
Looks like somebody did
a good job with the bandaging.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.327
What about
the heavy breathing?

39:34.589 --> 39:36.199
He's a little stressed.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.812
I'm not going to bother him.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.379
Have you been
keeping him warm?

39:41.379 --> 39:43.293
Birds like to be kept warm.

39:43.293 --> 39:46.601
I work in a garage studio.
It's not cold.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.560
It stays cool, but...

39:50.518 --> 39:53.347
I've been glazing down there,
but that's not too stinky.

39:53.347 --> 39:57.090
Well, maybe the studio
is not the best place.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.832
You could put
a hot water bottle in the box.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.311
Uh, do you have one?

40:02.791 --> 40:04.880
Get one at the drug store.
Fill it with hot water.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.231
No hot water at my place.
Going on two weeks now.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.494
Do you have a stove?

40:10.843 --> 40:12.627
I have a stove.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.456
Heat some water
in a kettle or a pot,

40:15.456 --> 40:16.675
just wrap it in a towel.

40:16.675 --> 40:17.980
You don't want it too hot,

40:17.980 --> 40:19.504
but comfortable.

40:20.592 --> 40:21.723
That's all?

40:22.637 --> 40:24.073
It's a pigeon.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.846
I owe you some beers.

42:42.429 --> 42:43.604
Hi. How's the bird?

42:48.783 --> 42:51.656
Cost $150.

42:51.656 --> 42:55.355
I put it on my credit card.
I need to be paid back.

42:55.355 --> 43:00.665
A hundred and fifty dollars?
Wow, what'd they do to him?

43:00.665 --> 43:02.188
It's my one
big day for working

43:02.188 --> 43:05.321
and it got totally screwed up
taking care of your bird.

43:06.105 --> 43:08.107
I'm sorry about the day.

43:09.238 --> 43:12.024
You can take the money
off the rent.

43:12.024 --> 43:13.765
Doesn't get me back
the time.

43:18.030 --> 43:19.292
She's amazing.

43:22.382 --> 43:24.471
Love the green stockings.

43:25.124 --> 43:26.560
So cool.

43:27.996 --> 43:29.128
Awesome.

43:34.437 --> 43:38.920
Anything else
I should know? About the bird?

43:38.920 --> 43:42.532
I got some bird seed.
$3.99.

43:45.144 --> 43:48.364
Okay.
Thanks for taking care of him.

43:50.236 --> 43:51.759
Come on, <i>petit oiseau.</i>

43:51.759 --> 43:52.847
You're coming over
to my place.

43:52.847 --> 43:54.588
We'll have a nice time.

43:54.588 --> 43:56.198
Say bye to Lizzy.

43:56.198 --> 43:58.374
Bye bye, Lizzy.

43:59.071 --> 44:00.638
Bye, Lizzy.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.316
Good move getting here early.

44:28.317 --> 44:29.623
You got your own kiln.

44:29.623 --> 44:31.146
I had to pull an all-nighter.

44:34.497 --> 44:36.108
All right...

44:43.855 --> 44:45.770
You can take them up
to cone six.

44:47.206 --> 44:48.207
Cone six.

45:01.524 --> 45:02.700
She's great.

45:10.055 --> 45:11.752
Maybe soak them a while.

45:13.014 --> 45:14.146
Okay.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.583
I can do that.

45:20.108 --> 45:21.849
How many more pieces
we got coming?

45:22.981 --> 45:25.940
Uh, just one.
I'm almost there.

45:26.811 --> 45:29.509
Okay.
Be quick with it.

45:56.492 --> 45:57.711
Great framing...

46:32.006 --> 46:33.399
How's the bird?

46:36.881 --> 46:38.273
Seems all right.

46:39.057 --> 46:40.406
Got him over by the window.

47:04.909 --> 47:06.084
I'm gonna take him
to the office.

47:06.084 --> 47:07.302
It's loud in here.

47:07.955 --> 47:09.174
Okay.

47:48.474 --> 47:49.475
What's this?

47:50.084 --> 47:51.129
A bird.

47:52.130 --> 47:53.218
That's a pigeon.

47:55.437 --> 47:58.136
Adorable. What happened?

47:58.136 --> 47:59.485
Jo found it.

48:00.529 --> 48:02.792
The vet thinks
it has a broken wing

48:02.792 --> 48:04.055
and is stressed out.

48:04.925 --> 48:06.274
What's this?

48:07.188 --> 48:08.929
Something Ned Halter ordered.

48:08.929 --> 48:10.539
Well, it looks personal.

48:10.539 --> 48:13.542
Tell Ned he can pick it up
in my office.

48:15.153 --> 48:17.329
You took a pigeon to a vet?

48:17.329 --> 48:19.679
Now that's crazy.

48:19.679 --> 48:22.029
Okay, go, thank you.
You're off duty.

48:22.029 --> 48:23.726
Miss, I'm from Tacoma.

48:23.726 --> 48:26.686
We shoot pigeons with BB guns.
We don't take them to the vet.

48:32.039 --> 48:34.259
Yo, Lizzy took a pigeon
to the vet.

48:34.259 --> 48:36.174
She thinks the pigeon
is stressed out.

48:56.063 --> 48:57.412
Before he journeyed...

48:57.412 --> 49:00.154
...in his spaceship
to the Moon in 1971,

49:00.154 --> 49:01.590
Starfield astronaut
Allan Shepard

49:01.590 --> 49:02.983
didn't think he'd be...

49:03.810 --> 49:05.812
Hey, kiddo.

49:05.812 --> 49:08.249
- For you.
- Ooh, thank you come in.

49:08.249 --> 49:12.123
My captors are dying
to meet you.

49:12.123 --> 49:16.823
Lee, Dorothy,
my daughter, Lizzy.

49:16.823 --> 49:21.436
So, this is Lizzy!
Wonderful to meet you.

49:21.436 --> 49:25.963
We've heard all about you.

49:25.963 --> 49:29.357
Dorothy and Lee have
just come down from Canada.

49:29.357 --> 49:34.362
Yeah, we were standing
in the gardens of Victoria.

49:34.362 --> 49:35.450
Last week?

49:37.322 --> 49:39.977
- So beautiful.
- Really beautiful.

49:40.542 --> 49:41.674
Have you been?

49:42.370 --> 49:43.545
No.

49:43.545 --> 49:45.025
Yes, you have.

49:45.025 --> 49:47.201
You were there
when you were little.

49:47.201 --> 49:50.291
Oh, okay.
Well, yes, then.

49:54.252 --> 49:56.210
Well, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

49:56.210 --> 49:58.473
I must go to the toilette.

49:58.473 --> 50:00.301
Oh, Bill, shall Lee
make some coffee?

50:00.301 --> 50:02.477
Knock yourself out,
my dear.

50:04.349 --> 50:06.742
You're about out of coffee
by the way.

50:06.742 --> 50:09.571
And we're running low
on 1% milk,

50:09.571 --> 50:10.833
if we're making a list.

50:10.833 --> 50:12.096
Oh, that's your
middle of the night

50:12.096 --> 50:13.271
cereal eating.

50:13.271 --> 50:15.186
Well, she's got me there.

50:36.598 --> 50:38.339
Dad, how long
are they staying?

50:38.339 --> 50:40.167
Oh, I don't know.

50:40.167 --> 50:41.777
Well, where do
they live anyway?

50:41.777 --> 50:45.738
They winter in Mexico
and summer in Canada,

50:45.738 --> 50:47.305
they're very free.

51:04.409 --> 51:07.107
Mom says "Hi", by the way.

51:07.107 --> 51:10.067
Oh, really?
Well, "Hello" in return.

51:11.851 --> 51:13.244
How's your show shaping up?

51:14.941 --> 51:15.985
Great.

51:18.031 --> 51:21.339
Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful.

51:36.571 --> 51:38.791
If you see anything you like
that you want,

51:38.791 --> 51:40.227
by all means, just take it.

51:43.317 --> 51:44.884
You should make more
like this.

51:46.886 --> 51:48.496
I'm enjoying my retirement.

51:51.282 --> 51:52.631
I don't believe you.

51:52.631 --> 51:54.154
Well, it's true.

51:56.156 --> 51:57.723
Well, you should do it anyway.

51:57.723 --> 51:59.420
Nah, my days are full.

51:59.420 --> 52:00.639
I get up,

52:00.639 --> 52:02.510
I do a little of this,
a little of that,

52:02.510 --> 52:04.208
and before you know it,

52:04.208 --> 52:06.035
it's time to watch TV again.

52:06.035 --> 52:07.776
That sounds terrible.

52:07.776 --> 52:09.474
That suits me just fine.

52:11.258 --> 52:12.477
I can't find it.

52:13.217 --> 52:15.610
I put it aside, but, um,

52:15.610 --> 52:17.960
must just got up
and walked away.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.484
Come on, let's go
join our friends again.

52:19.484 --> 52:20.572
Dad, those aren't
your friends.

52:20.572 --> 52:21.790
You barely know those people.

52:21.790 --> 52:23.183
Well, look at you.

52:27.492 --> 52:29.146
You've been there
all the time.

52:31.626 --> 52:33.150
Here, would you, uh, give this
to your brother

52:33.150 --> 52:34.281
when you see him again?

52:38.590 --> 52:41.375
For five years,
he lived in that jacket.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.899
I mean, it was mine,
but he took possession.

52:45.031 --> 52:47.120
He might like it again.

52:47.120 --> 52:49.383
- Yeah, I remember this.
- Yeah...

52:49.383 --> 52:50.471
Have you talked to Sean?

52:50.471 --> 52:51.864
I talk to him all the time.

52:51.864 --> 52:53.039
- C'mon, let's go...
- When's...

52:53.039 --> 52:54.345
When's the last time
you talked to him?

52:54.345 --> 52:58.131
He brought a delicious
stuffing for Thanksgiving.

52:58.131 --> 52:59.567
It was ravishing. Let's go.

52:59.567 --> 53:03.005
Dad...
Dad, that was six months ago.

53:03.005 --> 53:04.616
Well, he was great
six months ago.

53:04.616 --> 53:07.184
And his stuffing was superb.

53:16.367 --> 53:17.411
All right.

53:26.377 --> 53:28.205
Okay. You ready?

53:29.293 --> 53:30.381
Yeah, ready.

53:36.604 --> 53:38.432
Beautiful.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.435
You're right.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.229
Yeah.

53:54.318 --> 53:55.754
Just love them.

53:57.277 --> 53:58.713
Good job, Eric.

53:59.584 --> 54:01.107
Good job, girls.

54:03.892 --> 54:05.024
Hey.

54:07.069 --> 54:08.680
This is your stuff?

54:09.898 --> 54:11.204
Yeah, these are mine.

54:13.728 --> 54:17.254
I didn't know you did this.
How great.

54:24.348 --> 54:25.784
They look so good.

54:29.483 --> 54:33.661
Wow, each one,
so wonderful.

54:33.661 --> 54:34.923
They came out well, huh?

54:38.405 --> 54:41.539
Um, do you
have time tomorrow?

54:41.539 --> 54:43.410
Uh, shouldn't
be a problem.

54:44.933 --> 54:46.848
The earlier the better.

55:02.821 --> 55:05.127
Hello, Jo.
How are you, dear?

55:05.127 --> 55:08.261
Hi, Jean. I'm good.
I think so, anyway.

55:08.261 --> 55:09.915
How are things
at Nationale?

55:09.915 --> 55:13.310
Uh, I think I'm done
here and there.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.356
I think the shows
speak to each other

55:16.356 --> 55:18.315
in a really cool way.

55:18.315 --> 55:23.320
Bravo! The Abigail Firschein
Memorial Show,

55:23.320 --> 55:26.410
it's really such
a big deal and...

55:26.410 --> 55:29.064
Oh, we couldn't be prouder.

55:29.064 --> 55:33.417
The... The first OCAC alum
they've ever featured.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.767
Well, that
must feel good.

55:35.767 --> 55:38.073
I hope the catalogue
comes together in time.

55:38.073 --> 55:39.771
Yes, me too...

55:39.771 --> 55:42.904
Oh, we are thrilled
to be honoring you.

55:42.904 --> 55:45.777
We're...
We're doing a catalogue?

55:45.777 --> 55:47.866
Did you know Jo Tran
is getting a catalogue?

55:47.866 --> 55:49.868
Hey, I can take the bird.

55:49.868 --> 55:51.696
I'm gonna go get something
to eat with Jackie

55:51.696 --> 55:53.393
and then go home.

55:53.393 --> 55:54.960
He can hang
in the car for a bit.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.527
He's fine here.

55:56.527 --> 55:58.398
I'll drop him off
when I come home.

56:00.618 --> 56:03.490
Okay, I'll take him
later then.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.581
- Hey, Jo...
- Hey.

56:07.581 --> 56:08.843
You're coming to
my opening tomorrow, right?

56:08.843 --> 56:10.628
Yeah, definitely.

56:10.628 --> 56:12.804
Uh, Lizzy,
do you have any dental floss?

57:12.646 --> 57:15.344
Hey, Jim, can you let
me into the guest bathroom?

57:15.344 --> 57:17.390
You're not supposed
to be in there.

57:17.390 --> 57:20.872
My hot water is still broken.
I really need a shower.

57:22.743 --> 57:23.831
I'll get the key,

57:23.831 --> 57:25.920
but you're not
supposed to be in there.

58:44.433 --> 58:46.044
I got your door unlocked.

58:46.044 --> 58:48.176
I don't want
any messes in there.

58:48.176 --> 58:49.482
No puddles.

59:00.406 --> 59:01.799
Hi.
- Hi.

59:01.799 --> 59:02.843
I'm cooking.

59:03.931 --> 59:05.150
Come on in.

59:10.024 --> 59:11.460
Brought you this coat.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.855
It's from dad's.
He thought you'd like it.

59:18.163 --> 59:20.600
And here's an invite
to my show, too, if you want.

59:21.645 --> 59:22.646
I left you a message.

59:22.646 --> 59:24.082
Yeah...

59:24.082 --> 59:26.214
You know
I'm not a big message guy.

59:28.042 --> 59:29.217
What you making?

59:30.958 --> 59:33.395
Dinner of kings. Ragu.

59:36.355 --> 59:39.750
Thought I'd be here earlier,
but so much traffic.

59:39.750 --> 59:41.882
People don't know
how to drive.

59:41.882 --> 59:43.884
Yeah, I almost got hit
the other day.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.234
Not surprised.

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:27.711
What's going on?

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.627
I lost Channel 4.

01:00:31.279 --> 01:00:33.194
Oh.

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:35.240
It's the only channel
I like to watch.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.852
Has all the old shows on it.

01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:41.202
<i>Hawaii 5-0.</i>

01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:45.119
<i>Twilight Zone.</i>

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:48.209
The good stuff.
But now it's just gone.

01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:54.912
Can you call the company?

01:00:56.174 --> 01:00:57.566
I don't have a company.

01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:00.395
I use the antenna.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.318
I know what's going on.

01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:13.887
What's going on?

01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:16.542
You don't want to know.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.071
The neighbors blocked it.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.164
Can they do that?

01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:31.992
They figured it out.

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:33.211
I don't... I don't know

01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:34.734
if that's something
they can really do.

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.519
You don't think so?

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.871
Believe me, they can.

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:42.220
And they do.

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:46.746
Those people
have their fingers

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:48.443
all over this place.

01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:55.842
Go see for yourself.

01:02:15.949 --> 01:02:18.212
Hey, I saw your car
and I thought I'd say "Hi".

01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:19.736
Hey, Craig.

01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:23.740
- Hi, Sean.
- It's Craig.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.265
Oh, hey. I thought
you were the other neighbors.

01:02:30.529 --> 01:02:33.097
Sean was just telling me
about his TV reception,

01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:34.751
that he's missing his shows.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.404
Still not working?

01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:37.579
Nope.

01:02:42.976 --> 01:02:45.196
Thinks the neighbors
have something to do with it.

01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.291
I see what you're doing.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.684
See what you're trying
to pass along. Ha-ha.

01:02:55.684 --> 01:02:57.208
Nice try.

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.732
Not passing
anything along, Sean.

01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:02.909
If you want, I could get you

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.346
a box set
of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:06.608
Have that on DVD.

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:11.657
That's not the same
if I know what's coming on.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.666
Oh, yeah,
I remember that jacket.

01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:25.932
Yeah, same one.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.206
Is he still doing
that landscaping thing?

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.513
I thought he had some work.

01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:43.689
I don't think so.
Not for a while.

01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:49.913
I rescued a bird.

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:07.887
He has a broken wing.

01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:10.890
Wow...

01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:14.589
Cool.

01:04:42.574 --> 01:04:44.489
Oh, he has his struggles.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:45.664
I am aware.

01:04:48.145 --> 01:04:49.842
He could use our love.

01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.890
He needs
more than that.

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:00.984
He's a genius
is part of the problem.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:03.247
Always a few steps
ahead of everyone.

01:05:05.336 --> 01:05:10.297
Just makes it so hard
to know what to expect.

01:05:10.297 --> 01:05:12.212
I don't know
that he's a genius.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:14.258
Well, he really has something.

01:05:14.258 --> 01:05:17.043
A lot of people say that.
They always have.

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:19.176
Some people.

01:05:19.176 --> 01:05:23.658
He was always
incredibly creative and, uh,

01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:25.791
some of the things
he's done, just...

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:27.445
Wow.

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:31.057
A lot of people are creative.

01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:37.803
You should give him
a little more credit.

01:05:37.803 --> 01:05:40.501
I do give him credit.
I just think he has problems.

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:42.590
I know...

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.159
But really who doesn't?

01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:58.084
All right, get out.
Get away. You're running.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.391
Go! You're running fast.

01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:03.481
Go, go, go, go,
you're running for your lives.

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:04.830
You're running for your lives.

01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:06.440
Go, go!

01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:43.521
Bye, thank you.

01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:50.702
- Bye, Marlene.
- See ya.

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:51.833
Thank you.

01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:07.284
Hey, Lizzy.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.025
Hi.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.723
Come to slum around
in studio arts?

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:14.117
Oh, no.
No, just hiding, really.

01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:15.422
Oh, cool.

01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:18.034
You can hide in here with me.

01:07:21.515 --> 01:07:23.256
So, you share a house?

01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.737
Oh, no... God.

01:07:25.737 --> 01:07:27.043
We're neighbors.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.219
Jo bought an old
apartment building.

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:32.613
Dad and her brother
helped her fix it up.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.835
Well, that sounds great.

01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:40.708
Yeah, she really
figured it out.

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.059
She can work in the studio
all the time now.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.104
I saw you have a show
coming up.

01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:47.193
Monday.

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.892
I have a friend in town
from New York.

01:07:50.892 --> 01:07:52.633
We'll come check it out.

01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:53.678
Cool.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.086
Nah...

01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:57.437
Fuck, my phone.

01:08:58.482 --> 01:09:00.092
Find it in the morning.

01:09:00.092 --> 01:09:01.267
Okay.

01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:47.155
Fun night?

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:52.987
It was all right.

01:10:54.075 --> 01:10:55.555
A lot of people.

01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:56.904
Everyone loved it?

01:10:58.558 --> 01:11:00.952
That's what they said.

01:11:00.952 --> 01:11:02.258
Sorry I couldn't be there,
but I saw the room.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.347
It looked amazing.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:07.306
I talked to Marlene Heyman
for a long time last night.

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:09.177
She really likes you.

01:11:09.177 --> 01:11:11.310
Went on and on
about your girls, the colors.

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:12.964
Mmm, that's cool.

01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:15.706
It is cool.
She's having a moment.

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:19.405
Anyway, I can take the bird
off your hands.

01:11:19.405 --> 01:11:20.711
Okay.

01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.321
Ricky will be happy.

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.078
Paper gets gross really fast.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.688
Okay.

01:11:57.008 --> 01:11:58.357
Hey, Jo, now that your shows
are open,

01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:00.316
you'll get on
the water heater, right?

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.407
Yup.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.714
'Cause I'd really like
to take a shower.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:15.679
Yeah.

01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:18.116
All right, this one
turned out beautiful.

01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:19.160
Good work. Good work.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:42.053
Come on, bae.

01:12:46.187 --> 01:12:47.319
Ahh!

01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:54.108
Must've been burning
hot on one side.

01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:55.806
It's a little funky, but...

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:57.373
I don't mind imperfections.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.287
In fact, I like them.
I prefer it.

01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:02.639
Think it looks cool.

01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:04.684
- Don't you?
- Not really.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.530
What?

01:13:49.294 --> 01:13:50.730
What's going on?

01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:52.340
Oh.

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.562
What are you doing here?

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.437
Just came by...

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.177
I was gonna
show you something.

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:05.789
But you look sort of busy.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:11.751
What are you doing?

01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:14.841
What does it
look like I'm doing?

01:14:17.365 --> 01:14:18.802
I'm making a piece.

01:14:20.847 --> 01:14:22.370
It's a very major piece.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.982
Very major.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.555
I didn't know
you were into earth work.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.168
Art is the earth talking.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.650
Poetry is the voice
of the earth.

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:42.608
So, it's all earth work.

01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:49.615
These are mouths.

01:14:58.406 --> 01:14:59.407
Listen.

01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:10.549
You have to listen
to what isn't being said.

01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:20.516
You hear that?

01:15:21.429 --> 01:15:22.953
I don't think I do.

01:15:30.569 --> 01:15:33.616
So many people
choose not to hear.

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:40.971
Sean...

01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:07.475
Okay...

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:13.917
- Hello.
<i>I'm at Sean's.</i>

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.396
<i>Things are not good here.
He's not good...</i>

01:16:15.396 --> 01:16:16.789
<i>-</i>
<i>- He's really off...</i>

01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:52.477
Hey.

01:16:54.174 --> 01:16:56.307
So, where is he?

01:16:56.307 --> 01:16:58.570
Still in the backyard,
I think.

01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:02.835
No, you... You go home.

01:17:02.835 --> 01:17:05.577
- I can... I can go with you.
- No, please. Lizzy...

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:08.624
You go home.

01:17:14.934 --> 01:17:16.457
- Whoa... Yeah.

01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:17.676
Best thing
I've ever seen.

01:17:17.676 --> 01:17:18.938
- I mean it.
- Thank you.

01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:21.027
Wow. Technique, um...

01:17:22.812 --> 01:17:25.379
I mean, it was
just a momentary thing...

01:17:41.178 --> 01:17:42.570
Who is this?
What's this?

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:45.182
Oh, really,
just, like, the worst.

01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:49.839
But I think you should look
at her earlier work

01:17:49.839 --> 01:17:51.492
because, I think,
that's actually what...

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.714
This idea of, like,
post feminism ideal.

01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:57.194
Oh, I would.

01:17:57.194 --> 01:17:59.500
I think it's actually
a pretty good piece, come on.

01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:13.950
I need to see it.
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:44.241
<i>This is Jean. Leave a message.</i>

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:49.855
Mom, what's going on
over there?

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:51.030
Can you fill me in?

01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:10.223
<i>Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message.</i>

01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:13.792
Hey, one of your guests
took my parking space.

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:15.185
That is not cool.

01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:18.057
Also, just reminding you
that the bird

01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:20.930
needs his paper changed
every few hours.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.630
Gets pretty gross in there
if you don't change the paper.

01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:36.744
<i>This is Jean. Leave a message.</i>

01:20:38.268 --> 01:20:40.574
Mom, I'm really anxious
to know what's going on there.

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.795
Give me a call.

01:21:46.075 --> 01:21:48.207
<i>Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message.</i>

01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:52.211
You know, I'm so fucking sick
of not having hot water, Jo.

01:21:52.211 --> 01:21:53.734
It is such a total drag.

01:21:53.734 --> 01:21:56.389
And such a shitty thing
to do to a person.

01:21:56.389 --> 01:21:57.738
I'm sick of it.

01:21:59.001 --> 01:22:00.219
Have a great night.

01:22:08.445 --> 01:22:10.360
I need to use the shower, too.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.665
Here?

01:22:11.665 --> 01:22:14.059
That shower is
a storage space. It's packed.

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:16.235
Well, I don't have any
hot water and I need a shower.

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:17.758
We'll figure it out.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.018
What's going on?

01:23:00.018 --> 01:23:01.715
Why haven't
you called me back?

01:23:03.848 --> 01:23:06.155
<i>Well,
it's been busy here.</i>

01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:07.852
Are you still there?

01:23:07.852 --> 01:23:10.724
<i>I just left.
He was finally sleeping.</i>

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:13.771
<i>He had a lot to say.</i>

01:23:14.946 --> 01:23:16.252
Are you sure
that he's asleep?

01:23:16.252 --> 01:23:17.905
<i>Well, he was quiet.</i>

01:23:19.081 --> 01:23:20.212
<i>He was resting.</i>

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:23.737
Okay. Well, call me later.

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.130
Bye.

01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:38.535
Hey.

01:23:38.535 --> 01:23:40.319
Hey.

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:42.321
Where's the bird?

01:23:43.801 --> 01:23:44.976
Inside.

01:23:45.716 --> 01:23:47.283
You left him alone?

01:23:47.283 --> 01:23:48.501
He's fine.

01:23:57.728 --> 01:23:59.077
The hot water bottle
doesn't even

01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:01.471
- stay hot that long.
Lizzy...

01:24:01.471 --> 01:24:02.994
It isn't even cold out.

01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:08.217
When's my hot water
coming back on?

01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:12.830
I'm on it.

01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:15.963
Well, you keep
saying that, but...

01:24:15.963 --> 01:24:18.096
What are we talking, tomorrow?

01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:20.316
I have to drive out to Kelso
to get the new heater,

01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:21.926
and the guy said
he won't be there tomorrow.

01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:23.667
But he's supposed to be there
the next day.

01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:25.625
Is that the only
water heater anywhere?

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.366
Why does it
have to be that one?

01:24:27.366 --> 01:24:29.499
It's the best
and cheapest, yeah.

01:24:31.457 --> 01:24:33.111
I pay rent, you know?

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:34.939
Not that much.

01:24:35.766 --> 01:24:36.984
What?

01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:42.773
I said you don't pay
that much rent, that's all.

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:44.992
You have a really good deal.
It's no excuse for the water.

01:24:44.992 --> 01:24:46.081
But you do.

01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:50.389
And, please, stop
leaving me messages like that.

01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:42.267
All right.

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:43.747
This is a lot
of cheese

01:25:43.747 --> 01:25:45.575
and I don't think that people
are gonna eat this much.

01:25:48.099 --> 01:25:49.405
They'll eat a little bit of it

01:25:49.405 --> 01:25:51.102
and then the rest of it
is gonna go to waste.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.192
Lizzy, your guests
are gonna be here

01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:56.194
in a few minutes.

01:25:56.194 --> 01:25:58.153
It's going to
be a special night

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:01.895
and no one is going
to be looking at the cheese.

01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:03.854
Okay, they're coming
to celebrate you

01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:05.464
and all of
your beautiful work.

01:26:15.692 --> 01:26:17.607
What's happening?

01:26:17.607 --> 01:26:18.999
<i>I just wanted
to let you know</i>

01:26:18.999 --> 01:26:20.784
I'm driving over to Sean's.

01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:22.307
He said he'd come tonight,

01:26:22.307 --> 01:26:25.745
and so I'm bringing him along
as my date.

01:26:25.745 --> 01:26:28.052
<i>Okay, if you think
he really wants to.</i>

01:26:29.096 --> 01:26:30.576
Oh, he wants to.

01:26:30.576 --> 01:26:33.405
<i>Of course he does.
So, we'll see you soon.</i>

01:26:33.405 --> 01:26:34.450
Okay. Bye.

01:26:42.849 --> 01:26:43.981
Sean's coming.

01:26:47.376 --> 01:26:50.466
He's not going
to break anything, is he?

01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:52.511
Seems like you're not
taking away any cheese.

01:26:58.909 --> 01:26:59.910
Hi, Dad.

01:27:02.652 --> 01:27:06.221
It looks amazing!
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

01:27:07.613 --> 01:27:09.963
Hi, Dad.
Um, thank you for coming.

01:27:12.705 --> 01:27:14.272
How nice.

01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:16.492
It's close to downtown,
that's nice.

01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:18.798
This gallery is first rate.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:20.104
I mean, it might not
look like much,

01:27:20.104 --> 01:27:22.628
but they do some
really great things here.

01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:25.936
Why don't you guys
have a look?

01:27:26.937 --> 01:27:28.112
Or some wine?

01:27:28.112 --> 01:27:29.635
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

01:27:29.635 --> 01:27:31.289
- Go ahead.
Yeah.

01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:32.334
- Thank you.
- Zinfandel...

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:33.770
Thank you, thank you.

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.075
One of those, please.

01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:38.775
Dates.

01:27:49.133 --> 01:27:51.744
Well, you are very daring
with the colors.

01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:32.829
Yeah.

01:28:37.094 --> 01:28:38.225
Yeah.

01:28:57.375 --> 01:28:58.594
Hello there, Craig.

01:28:58.594 --> 01:28:59.725
Hi, Mrs. Carr.

01:28:59.725 --> 01:29:02.946
I was hoping
to find Sean back here.

01:29:02.946 --> 01:29:04.121
Uh, no one answered the door.

01:29:04.121 --> 01:29:05.470
I don't think he's here.

01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:09.474
Oh! I'm to pick him up
and I wonder where he is.

01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:13.435
Sometimes he...
He walks through the park

01:29:13.435 --> 01:29:15.567
over to the corner store
on 92nd.

01:29:24.446 --> 01:29:25.838
You know,
it's just a funny thing.

01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:28.188
A decade makes
all the difference.

01:29:28.188 --> 01:29:29.233
Yeah.

01:29:30.234 --> 01:29:31.409
Yes, and who's gonna tell...

01:29:31.409 --> 01:29:33.411
How they're gonna
tell their stories?

01:29:44.335 --> 01:29:46.642
When I'm in my dream space,

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.950
that's when it happens.
I mean, like...

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:55.085
I just flow, you know?
I can do no wrong in that.

01:29:55.085 --> 01:29:57.217
At that point,
it just happens.

01:30:51.968 --> 01:30:52.969
Hey.

01:30:54.231 --> 01:30:56.538
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:30:56.538 --> 01:30:58.104
Wouldn't miss it.

01:30:58.104 --> 01:30:59.671
Lizzy, this is Janet.

01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:02.674
Janet is the gallery director
where I show in New York.

01:31:03.806 --> 01:31:05.155
Nice to meet you.

01:31:05.155 --> 01:31:08.332
Congratulations.
I hear great things.

01:31:08.332 --> 01:31:10.682
Well, my best piece
got closer to the fire

01:31:10.682 --> 01:31:11.857
than I wanted,

01:31:11.857 --> 01:31:13.816
but I didn't have
any control over that.

01:31:13.816 --> 01:31:16.340
Well, things look great
from here.

01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:20.518
Come on, at this stage,
you've just got to own it.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:21.824
How often does
something come out of the kiln

01:31:21.824 --> 01:31:23.782
looking just as you expected.

01:31:23.782 --> 01:31:25.131
Yeah, I guess...

01:31:28.221 --> 01:31:29.266
Jo.

01:31:30.746 --> 01:31:32.356
- You came.
- Of course I did.

01:31:32.356 --> 01:31:34.401
I brought this guy.
He wanted to say hi.

01:31:34.401 --> 01:31:35.446
Oh...

01:31:36.273 --> 01:31:38.188
He's seen you make it all.

01:31:39.755 --> 01:31:41.496
Yeah, okay.

01:31:45.848 --> 01:31:46.979
It looks good.

01:31:52.637 --> 01:31:54.291
Your dad's hilarious.

01:32:00.297 --> 01:32:01.516
I'm gonna look around.

01:32:45.647 --> 01:32:47.605
This one looks familiar.

01:32:50.347 --> 01:32:52.828
Yeah, that's me. Cute.

01:32:58.834 --> 01:33:00.662
Have you swum
with the dolphins?

01:33:01.184 --> 01:33:02.620
Twice.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.752
How much it cost?

01:33:05.884 --> 01:33:07.538
- What?
- I don't remember.

01:33:13.849 --> 01:33:16.025
I mean, she was just a snob.

01:33:16.025 --> 01:33:21.334
Such a snob. Oh, my God.
A first-class snob.

01:33:21.334 --> 01:33:23.728
Your dad is talking
about Hilda Morris.

01:33:23.728 --> 01:33:25.251
You like her stuff?

01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:26.949
Yeah, I love Hilda.

01:33:34.957 --> 01:33:36.872
I just, kind of,
fell into that.

01:33:42.181 --> 01:33:45.010
My pal did the cabinets
in her living room

01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:48.100
and he said she didn't
have a good word for anybody.

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.015
For anybody.

01:33:50.015 --> 01:33:52.844
Lizzy, it looks wonderful,
just wonderful.

01:33:52.844 --> 01:33:54.193
Congratulations.

01:33:54.193 --> 01:33:56.195
This is Lizzy's mom,
Jean Carr.

01:33:56.195 --> 01:33:58.023
Davis. Jean Davis.

01:33:58.023 --> 01:34:01.026
The other thing about her
was this leather vest.

01:34:01.026 --> 01:34:02.985
She loved this leather vest.

01:34:02.985 --> 01:34:05.640
She would not be seen
without her leather vest.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.032
You talking
about Hilda Morris?

01:34:07.032 --> 01:34:09.600
- Yes, I am.
- You never knew Hilda Morris.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.906
I beg to differ.

01:34:10.906 --> 01:34:12.168
No, I don't think you did.

01:34:12.168 --> 01:34:14.083
- Mom, where's Sean?
- I don't know.

01:34:14.083 --> 01:34:15.693
I couldn't find him.

01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:17.042
Well, that's his loss.

01:34:20.045 --> 01:34:22.221
You know this other friend
of mine has a house...

01:34:22.221 --> 01:34:23.701
I thought you
were getting him.

01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:24.963
Well, he wasn't there.

01:34:24.963 --> 01:34:28.488
And I...
I thought he might be here.

01:34:28.488 --> 01:34:29.968
He shouldn't
just be out by himself.

01:34:29.968 --> 01:34:31.361
Mom, that's not good.

01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:34.581
I'm sure he's fine.
He's probably at a friend's.

01:34:34.581 --> 01:34:35.931
Sean doesn't have any friends.

01:34:35.931 --> 01:34:38.368
Craig's a friend.

01:34:38.368 --> 01:34:40.283
Mom, he could
be anywhere right now.

01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:42.459
Lizzy, please relax.

01:34:42.459 --> 01:34:45.288
This is your night.
Try to enjoy yourself.

01:34:45.288 --> 01:34:46.550
Well, I'm not
just gonna stand here

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:47.899
while Sean has gone missing.

01:34:47.899 --> 01:34:49.466
Who said he's gone missing?

01:34:51.598 --> 01:34:52.599
Sean...

01:34:53.426 --> 01:34:55.298
Oh, there you are.

01:34:55.298 --> 01:34:57.779
I... I went to pick you up.

01:34:57.779 --> 01:35:00.259
I said I was coming.
I took the bus.

01:35:00.259 --> 01:35:02.740
I thought we said
that I was getting you.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:04.742
No matter.

01:35:04.742 --> 01:35:06.135
- Hey.
- I'm happy you're here.

01:35:06.135 --> 01:35:07.310
Here I am.

01:35:13.055 --> 01:35:15.100
Try picking up your phone
once in a while.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.985
Easy on the cheese.

01:35:29.985 --> 01:35:32.248
What do you mean?

01:35:32.248 --> 01:35:35.251
It's for everyone.
I don't want to run out.

01:35:35.251 --> 01:35:37.470
Cheese is out on the table.

01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:39.168
You shouldn't put cheese
out on the table

01:35:39.168 --> 01:35:41.126
if you don't
want people to eat it.

01:35:41.126 --> 01:35:43.781
- This isn't dinner, Sean.
- It's my dinner.

01:35:43.781 --> 01:35:45.827
Leave the cheese alone, seriously.

01:35:45.827 --> 01:35:47.654
Sean, uh,
have you spoken to Craig?

01:35:47.654 --> 01:35:49.787
- Uh, he was looking for you.
- What did he want?

01:35:50.832 --> 01:35:51.876
Stop it.

01:35:53.095 --> 01:35:55.053
Yeah, they came
to the Derick Tibbs show.

01:35:55.793 --> 01:35:57.490
Late...

01:35:57.490 --> 01:36:00.711
I think they do it on purpose.
Kind of just come.

01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:02.104
And then leave.

01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:11.548
Hello, Sean! Finally, huh?

01:36:11.548 --> 01:36:13.463
Hey, Lizzy, I...
I just wanted to tell you,

01:36:13.463 --> 01:36:16.074
I... I really like
your friend Janet.

01:36:16.074 --> 01:36:18.642
And, uh, and she said
she wants to come and see, uh,

01:36:18.642 --> 01:36:21.166
my pots,
if you know what I'm saying.

01:36:21.166 --> 01:36:22.994
Oh, my God,
did you say that to her?

01:36:22.994 --> 01:36:25.040
No, I didn't have
to say anything. She offered.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.781
That was to get you to leave.

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:30.262
No, it was not
to get me to leave, Jean.

01:36:30.262 --> 01:36:32.090
We had a meeting
of the minds, all right?

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:34.527
We have a lot in common.

01:36:34.527 --> 01:36:37.748
Well, we do. We do.
As it turns out, we do.

01:36:37.748 --> 01:36:39.358
You're not supposed
to have any cheese.

01:36:39.358 --> 01:36:42.492
Who the hell are you?
I can eat as much as I want.

01:36:42.492 --> 01:36:45.190
Oh, Lizzy,
the show is awesome.

01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:46.626
You should be so proud.

01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:47.845
Thanks, Terri.
Thanks for coming.

01:36:47.845 --> 01:36:49.238
Yeah, of course.

01:36:51.893 --> 01:36:55.244
People sure love
to kiss your ass, huh?

01:36:56.027 --> 01:36:57.550
Stop talking to me.

01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:59.465
Both of you please stop.
You're embarrassing me.

01:36:59.465 --> 01:37:00.553
All right, all right,
all right.

01:37:00.553 --> 01:37:02.077
Leave them alone, will you?

01:37:02.077 --> 01:37:03.730
You don't have to tell them
how to talk to each other.

01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:05.776
What I say to them
doesn't really concern you.

01:37:05.776 --> 01:37:07.125
Concerns me
in that I'm here

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:08.300
and I have to listen to it.

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.867
No one,
but you in there, Bill.

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:12.261
No, you're standing in
your own little world, Jean.

01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:14.219
Listen, buddy, don't you begin

01:37:14.219 --> 01:37:16.134
to tell me
how to talk to my kids.

01:37:16.134 --> 01:37:17.875
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:19.964
Not like
she'd listen anyway.

01:37:21.618 --> 01:37:23.315
Bird!

01:37:34.936 --> 01:37:36.111
Wow.

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:24.768
No, Sean, wait!

01:38:51.708 --> 01:38:53.362
I guess he was ready to go.

01:40:19.926 --> 01:40:21.624
Gonna go to get
some cigarettes.

01:40:35.986 --> 01:40:37.944
Saw Mike's show yesterday.

01:40:37.944 --> 01:40:38.989
How was it?

01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:40.512
It was good.

01:40:41.687 --> 01:40:43.602
I heard
he's doing deserts again.

01:40:44.777 --> 01:40:47.954
Yeah...
I liked his trees better.

01:40:49.739 --> 01:40:51.001
I like the deserts.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.745
I always forget
Mike's color blind.

01:40:55.745 --> 01:40:57.051
Isn't that weird?

01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:58.139
Totally.
