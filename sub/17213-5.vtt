00:13.681 --> 00:15.766
Dad?

00:15.849 --> 00:18.561
Dad! Please, stop!

00:18.644 --> 00:20.062
Daddy! Stop!

00:20.145 --> 00:23.023
Dad! Stop the car!
You're scaring me!

00:24.692 --> 00:26.068
Dad! Stop! Please!

00:26.151 --> 00:27.319
Dad!

00:28.946 --> 00:30.531
Daddy, stop! Stop!

00:33.659 --> 00:34.868
Dad, stop!

00:34.952 --> 00:36.870
Dad, stop!

00:42.167 --> 00:43.627
Dad, stop, please!

00:55.430 --> 00:57.015
Welcome to the 21st.

00:57.099 --> 00:58.183
I'm Traveler 3468.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.352
-3117.
-3890.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.687
3892.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.397
What's happening?

01:05.482 --> 01:06.483
Misfire.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.114
Shit.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.240
Uh...

01:13.323 --> 01:14.992
Hi. I'm Grant.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.368
What's your name?

01:16.451 --> 01:17.494
Charlotte.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.248
Charlotte, it's okay.
I'm a policeman.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.709
No, really. I... I am. See?

01:23.792 --> 01:25.335
It says FBI.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.505
Well, it's like a policeman.
It's better, even!

01:28.588 --> 01:31.008
Look, my friends and I
need to have a talk with your...

01:31.091 --> 01:33.802
your mom and your dad and your brother
about what just happened.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.012
Why was he doing that?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.764
Why did you do that?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.641
Look, I know you're upset.
I would be, too.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.143
Just let us...
Let us talk with your family,

01:41.226 --> 01:43.061
and everything will be all right,
I promise.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.023
Sweetie, do you have
any other family that live around here?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.566
Ten klicks back down the road.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.818
-Grandmother, mother's side.
-Your side.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.572
-How about if I take you there?
-I want to go with my mom.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.700
You go with the nice man,
Charlotte.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.077
We'll be back in a few days,
and we'll be a family again.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.956
Okay, that's my car over there.
The black one.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.541
Can you wait there for me?

02:08.879 --> 02:11.674
Car was going pretty fast.
Maybe she was moving inside of it?

02:11.757 --> 02:13.676
It's a tough T.E.L.L.
for the director to calculate.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.428
No, it doesn't matter. It happened.
I'll deal with her now.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.305
Who is your historian?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.640
She was going to be.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.603
This isn't nearly enough to set you up,

02:25.688 --> 02:27.773
so put it on Non-Event Horizon
in the fourth.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.902
It's a horse race.
Tomorrow. Look it up.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.615
This is the device.
Keep it upright.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.202
What are you gonna do with her?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.662
I guess I'll take her to Grandma's

02:41.745 --> 02:44.247
and explain that Mom and Dad
will be back after the mission.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.416
Obviously without
mentioning the mission,

02:46.499 --> 02:50.253
which is in just over 48 hours,
and you're down a team member.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.172
-Can you make the adjustment?
-We'll be ready.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.342
Go. We can brief them.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.052
Good. Protocol 5 till then.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.267
Okay, boss. It's done.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.519
Tip went out as of this morning.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.981
I wonder how many misfires
there have been since we started this.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.441
The first wave was upwards of 30%.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.026
Wow! Nobody told me that.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.237
Yeah. Me neither.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.072
Would you have still volunteered?

03:18.824 --> 03:20.283
Probably.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.037
I mean, if you think about it,
what other choice did we--

04:25.849 --> 04:27.267
Carly?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.814
Carly?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.277
Trevor...

04:39.529 --> 04:40.948
I'm over here.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.202
You all right?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.539
Oh, God...
My head.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.623
Concussion.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.921
Can you tell if Marcy's breathing?
I can't see her face.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.174
Slow and shallow.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.678
Philip?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.057
Philip!

05:12.520 --> 05:13.856
What do we know?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.278
Not where we are...

05:20.362 --> 05:26.118
not for how long or who abducted us,
but it's been a couple of hours at least.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.703
My mouth is dry.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.999
No eyes or ears on us that I can see...

05:32.082 --> 05:33.834
But we shouldn't count on it.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.461
They cut out my com.
I can feel it!

05:36.544 --> 05:37.754
Yeah, same.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.467
I gotta stop getting whacked in the head.
I'm a blank here.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.595
Where's the boss?

05:45.678 --> 05:48.056
MacLaren was on his way
to Grandma's house.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.726
So he wasn't with us when we were taken.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.979
That's good. There's a chance
he'll find us before the mission.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.939
Well, he'd better hurry up.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.401
Wheelchairs?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.403
Whoever they are,
they plan on moving us.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.072
Don't know about that.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.324
They're giving us fluids intravenously.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.618
I think we're gonna be
in these chairs a while.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.122
And it's been a lot of years
since I felt this sensation, but...

06:13.331 --> 06:14.874
it's pretty unmistakable.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.211
Catheter.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.256
Oh, God.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.259
- Is that what that is?
- Yes, ma'am.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.593
And do me a favor.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.931
Don't say anything remotely suggestive.
It could get very painful over here.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.515
Don't make me laugh.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.475
I'm serious!

06:32.559 --> 06:34.852
It's like a 17-year-old male's
default setting.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.486
Look who showed up to work.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.823
Hey.
Thought you were driving to Olympia?

06:47.740 --> 06:48.951
I was delayed.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.329
Where were you this morning?

06:53.455 --> 06:54.872
Oh, Kathryn, uh...

06:54.957 --> 06:57.334
She needed me to pick up
an antique chair for a client

06:57.417 --> 06:58.961
'cause it wouldn't fit in her car.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.045
Why? What did I miss?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.339
You know, the funny thing
about court dates is,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.091
when you miss one,
you don't get another one next week.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.884
-You get it next month, or next year.
-That was this morning...

07:06.969 --> 07:08.636
It's cool, I covered for you again.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.223
-You were the lead on this one, man.
-I'm sorry, man.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.765
Don't apologize to me.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.228
You got one angry prosecutor
on your hands.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.008
Well, hello, sir.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.260
Didn't catch your name on the way in.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.346
I was unconscious.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.432
I'm Trevor.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.185
So here's the thing.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.647
I got this geography test tomorrow
that I really gotta study for.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.317
Capital cities, countries...

08:04.401 --> 08:06.236
Am I gonna be able to do that?

08:06.319 --> 08:09.364
'Cause it's pretty likely that my parents
are gonna ground me again if I fail.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.034
You know what that means?

08:12.117 --> 08:15.578
Having to watch hours of golf
on television with Gary!

08:15.662 --> 08:16.954
Don't do it to me, man.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.166
Where are you taking him?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.251
Hey, asshole!

08:21.334 --> 08:24.254
I said where are you taking him?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.547
Bye.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.134
I know it goes against your instincts...

08:30.218 --> 08:32.845
but don't waste any more energy
trying to get free from the restraints.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.097
It's not gonna happen.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.817
Hello?

08:50.488 --> 08:51.906
Marce?

09:01.958 --> 09:02.959
Hey. It's me.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.003
Um, I thought you said you were
gonna be coming home early for...

09:06.088 --> 09:10.300
for dinner tonight and, uh,
I couldn't decide what we were gonna have,

09:10.383 --> 09:14.596
so I bought the ingredients
for basically two different...

09:14.679 --> 09:15.680
dinners,

09:15.763 --> 09:18.558
and, uh, I was just curious
to see what you'd...

09:18.641 --> 09:20.518
you'd like to have tonight, so...

09:22.604 --> 09:26.316
Yeah, one of them would be
like a roast chicken with vegetables,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.235
and the other one,

09:28.318 --> 09:30.070
it's more of a...

09:30.153 --> 09:33.823
It's like a pasta thing I do, and, um...

09:33.906 --> 09:37.827
well, now I'm talking to you as if
you're actually on the phone.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.288
I don't know why I do that.
That's, uh...

09:41.581 --> 09:43.750
Well, that's weird.
So anyway, uh, give me a call,

09:43.833 --> 09:46.002
or I will see you when you get back here.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.754
Hopefully soon. Okay.

09:48.796 --> 09:52.675
I'm gonna start on the roast chicken...
unless you really want the pasta,

09:52.759 --> 09:55.178
in which case, call me back. It's David.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.971
And I'm doing it again. Bye.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.742
Ow...

10:18.743 --> 10:20.162
We're here, Marcy.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.749
How bad is it?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.751
My head and my neck.

10:28.836 --> 10:33.175
Probably... just whiplash from the impact.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.894
This is... the worst hospital
in the world, or--

10:44.977 --> 10:46.396
We've been abducted.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.400
I obviously vomited on myself.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.985
Anybody clock when?

10:54.111 --> 10:55.780
Probably before we got here.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.032
The stink's not as bad as it was.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.411
Sorry.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.831
Smells around here aren't
going to improve much.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.709
We've only met one of our captors.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.752
He came and wheeled Philip
out of here a while ago.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.380
Never said a word.
That's all we know.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.549
We know they intend to keep us alive
for a while at least.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.758
They've got us on IVs.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.136
How long have I been out?

11:19.221 --> 11:20.763
A few hours longer than us.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.403
Now, don't be like that,
Mr. Giant!

11:37.614 --> 11:38.656
Pick me.

11:42.869 --> 11:46.623
Take me instead of her!
I'm asking nice here!

11:49.292 --> 11:50.460
Come on!

13:13.835 --> 13:15.837
What?
Am I supposed to answer?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.929
Who have I told what?

13:27.432 --> 13:28.725
I don't understand.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.859
No. I've never seen him before.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.237
No.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.785
He's the father of my child,
and he's a police officer.

13:47.869 --> 13:50.622
So if I were you people, I'd...

14:01.674 --> 14:03.801
I don't understand the question.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.350
I have no idea what you're talking about.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.352
Who am I talking to?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.146
Why don't you show yourself?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.732
Look.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.568
I just take care of my son all day.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.654
My specialty is mac and cheese.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.921
He's with his father today.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.551
Don't you hurt him!

14:44.634 --> 14:46.844
Don't you dare hurt him!

14:56.521 --> 15:02.026
If that child is harmed in any way...

15:03.736 --> 15:05.863
I will hunt you down...

15:05.947 --> 15:09.576
whoever you are, whenever you are...

15:10.993 --> 15:12.454
and I will kill you.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.710
Hey.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.962
Sorry to interrupt. There's someone here
who'd like to see you.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.296
A David Mailer?

16:04.380 --> 16:05.465
Who?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.550
"A mutual friend of Marcy," he said.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.801
Sir, I can send him away.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.553
He gave me the impression
that you knew each other.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.263
No, that's... uh, send him in.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.442
David Mailer, sir.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.737
-Thanks, Beth.
-Hi. David Mailer.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.198
She just... said that.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.201
So, FBI headquarters, huh?

16:34.285 --> 16:37.121
It's a field office. Uh... How did you...

16:37.204 --> 16:40.082
Uh, the address was on the, uh...

16:40.166 --> 16:41.793
the card that you gave me.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.294
I gave you?

16:43.377 --> 16:46.589
Yeah, well, you slipped it under my door
while I was out a while back.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.842
We spoke on the phone later that night.
You don't remember.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.095
No. How do I know this Marcy person?

16:55.723 --> 16:59.143
Well, I kinda know
that she works with you, so--

16:59.227 --> 17:02.104
Well, obviously, I can neither confirm
or deny that.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.773
Which is cool, and I totally get that,

17:03.856 --> 17:05.650
and I know that what you're doing
is very important, and--

17:05.733 --> 17:07.068
She really hasn't mentioned me?

17:07.151 --> 17:08.903
The point of this visit is...

17:09.904 --> 17:11.781
Marcy didn't come home last night.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.575
Not "home" home.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.660
She's just...
She's staying with me platonically,

17:15.743 --> 17:17.203
but I was expecting her for dinner.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.663
When did you last see her?

17:18.746 --> 17:21.290
Uh, yesterday morning, when she left.

17:21.373 --> 17:25.795
I'm sure she's on some sort of
secret FBI medical thing,

17:25.878 --> 17:28.673
but, uh, I was worried
and I just wanted to hear from you--

17:28.756 --> 17:30.592
Okay. Um, I'm gonna look into this.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.384
Uh... why don't you leave
your number with Beth,

17:32.468 --> 17:33.803
and I'll give you a call
if I find anything.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.387
-Wait. You don't know where she is either?
-Beth?

17:35.471 --> 17:38.975
Beth, can you please take Mr. Mailer's
contact information? Thank you.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.267
Uh...

17:41.268 --> 17:43.980
Marcy, it's MacLaren.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.650
Carly?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.278
Trevor? Philip?

17:52.614 --> 17:53.865
Shit!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.165
Now exhale.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.419
Feel the silence between your breaths.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.383
Your heart beating in your chest.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.468
Constant as the reactor beneath.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.972
Giving light.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.099
Heat.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.060
Time.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.909
Philip!

18:37.992 --> 18:39.118
Oh, thank God!

18:39.201 --> 18:42.038
I thought I was alone.

18:43.414 --> 18:46.668
I'm really gonna take it personally
if you don't pick me next time.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.305
Hey. Did you see Carly?
They just left with her.

18:59.388 --> 19:03.851
I woke up in an empty room...
and they brought me here.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.437
I don't even know
how long I was there. Hours?

19:06.520 --> 19:07.855
Wait, you hurt?

19:07.939 --> 19:10.482
Thanks to John Hetrick, no.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.908
Inventor of airbags, 1952.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.161
But I am hurtin' in other ways.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.663
Withdrawal.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.457
I haven't been able to go
more than 18 hours

19:26.540 --> 19:28.125
between doses since we got here,

19:28.209 --> 19:31.378
and I can pretty much tell you,
without looking at a clock,

19:31.462 --> 19:33.464
we're coming up on that number.

19:37.259 --> 19:41.973
Not the rehab facility
I thought that I'd end up in.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.351
Marcy and I were meditating.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.811
You should, too.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.481
There's no way.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.943
Trust me, Philip. It'll help.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.946
I promise.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.661
Now exhale.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.332
You're the one
who told me to take the red flag

20:08.415 --> 20:09.792
off these same four people.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.419
Well, now there's no sign
of any of them.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.921
One of them might be missing.
Just do it, please.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.465
I'll put in the request, but even
a priority facial recognition search

20:16.548 --> 20:18.175
isn't likely to turn up anything.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.886
Let's try to be a little more positive.
Shall we?

20:19.969 --> 20:22.513
Okay. Sure. I'm positive that
I'm the one they're gonna complain to

20:22.596 --> 20:25.016
for using up NSA mainframe time...

20:25.099 --> 20:27.309
on something
that you called a false alarm.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.732
Jesus, David,
what are you doing out here?

20:32.815 --> 20:35.026
Just waiting to hear
if you got anything yet.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.112
What? In the 11 minutes
since you left my office? No.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.530
I have employed resources.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.782
Like?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.158
If Marcy's face shows up

20:42.241 --> 20:44.994
practically anywhere
there's a closed-circuit TV camera,

20:45.077 --> 20:46.287
we'll know her location.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.997
Great.
Tell me how I can help.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.331
You can go home.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.042
Oh, my God.
You're just like her.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.126
Would you stop?

20:52.209 --> 20:54.420
You know what? I'm gonna help you out
whether you like it or not.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.546
How about that?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.757
What're you gonna do,
follow me on your bike?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.675
A-ha! She did tell you about me.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.221
You just gave it all away.
You know I have a bike.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.182
Your right pant leg is tucked
into your sock.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.392
I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.940
Okay, I get it. I'm not qualified,
but just know this.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.859
Marcy's welfare is very important to me.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.820
When I find her, I'll call you.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.447
Or better still... she'll just come home.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.033
Okay, so if I don't hear from you
by, like, what? Five--

21:40.925 --> 21:43.510
I'm getting the feeling
we're not gonna make our next mission.

21:44.553 --> 21:49.058
That is the least
of my problems right now.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.643
Come on, Philip.
You're stronger than that.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.645
You have no idea what this feels like,

21:53.729 --> 21:55.106
so why don't you--

22:15.542 --> 22:17.419
I can't see.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.090
I can't see!

22:34.686 --> 22:35.897
Really?

22:37.273 --> 22:39.733
You... You're gonna pass over me again?

22:40.902 --> 22:43.029
How many of them are there?
What did they do?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.656
Just the one you've already met.

22:45.739 --> 22:49.826
There was an old-style television
in an open space, like a warehouse.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.787
- In this building?
- Must be.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.206
Then they asked questions.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.500
Just words on the television.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.170
"When are you from?"

23:01.588 --> 23:02.798
Shit.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.927
They know.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.803
No. There's nothing to know.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.513
Well, they obviously know something.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.639
They have Jeffrey.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.641
- What?
- My son.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.727
They showed him to me on the television.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.688
They have him. I saw.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.242
Whoa, whoa. Guys?

23:30.326 --> 23:31.785
What's he doing?

23:32.744 --> 23:34.788
He's injecting something
into your IV line.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, what, um...

23:39.001 --> 23:40.336
I...

23:45.841 --> 23:47.759
Oh. Never mind.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.472
No. No, no, no!
Stop, stop. That's too much.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.057
No! Stop, he'll overdose! Stop!

23:54.766 --> 23:57.561
That's okay.
It's what I needed.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.980
That amount of heroin will slow

23:59.063 --> 24:01.232
your respiration rate and heart rate
to dangerous levels.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.734
Philip? You need to stay with us, okay?

24:03.817 --> 24:06.695
- I'm here.
- Philip, stay awake.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.447
Philip!
Listen to Marcy!

24:08.530 --> 24:10.699
I can hear you.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.868
- I'm...
- Philip.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.621
Philip. No. No, no!
No, no, no! Philip!

24:15.704 --> 24:17.123
Carly, make sure he stays awake!

24:17.206 --> 24:19.375
Philip, you stay awake, okay?

24:20.834 --> 24:24.338
Let's try this again.
Anyone on coms?

24:25.756 --> 24:27.049
Talk to me, gang.

24:50.781 --> 24:51.823
Hello?

25:00.124 --> 25:01.667
My name is Marcy Warton.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.171
I work at a library.

25:05.254 --> 25:08.049
I don't know why you've taken me here.
I haven't done anything wrong.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.931
<i>Hello? Marcy! Yes.</i>

25:16.014 --> 25:19.476
<i>Oh, thank God. I was so worried.</i>
<i>I've been freaking out.</i>

25:21.895 --> 25:24.940
<i>No. No, I get it.</i>
<i>Yeah. Mum's the word.</i>

25:25.023 --> 25:26.483
<i>Yeah, no, of course. You're busy.</i>

25:26.567 --> 25:29.111
<i>Okay. Well then, when you do,</i>
<i>I'll be here.</i>

25:31.447 --> 25:33.282
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>
<i>We'll have the chicken.</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:36.743
<i>Yeah, chicken sounds good.</i>
<i>I can't wait. Okay.</i>

25:36.827 --> 25:38.454
<i>Yeah. Bye-bye.</i>

25:47.338 --> 25:49.090
<i>Philip.</i>

25:49.173 --> 25:52.008
Philip, you do not have permission
to sleep!

25:52.093 --> 25:54.178
We asked you a question!

25:54.261 --> 25:55.471
I'm still here.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.139
Good. That's good.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.640
Talk to us.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.477
Tell us about your parents.
Where do they live?

26:01.560 --> 26:04.062
Yeah. You never talk about them.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.231
What's your mother's name?

26:06.940 --> 26:09.235
2144.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.445
Stay in the here and now, Philip.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.364
Do you remember
the taste of the water?

26:13.447 --> 26:16.367
Recycled so many times
it could never be made pure again?

26:16.450 --> 26:18.577
-Shut up!
-This can't be heroin.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.454
No, no, no, it is.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.123
Or at least the first one was.

26:22.206 --> 26:27.461
And I am more grateful for it
than I care to admit,

26:27.544 --> 26:30.005
but the second one was something else.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.716
Something I think
would only work on someone

26:32.799 --> 26:35.261
who's been modified to be an historian.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.470
What is it?

26:38.930 --> 26:39.931
Memory...

26:41.600 --> 26:43.477
pouring in like a flood.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.937
Like the Helios tidal wave.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.401
I can't stop.

26:51.777 --> 26:55.071
-I'm drowning in it!
-I want you to breathe deeply

26:55.156 --> 26:58.450
-and listen to my voice--
-You can't compete with this.

27:03.497 --> 27:06.083
Do you remember the taste
of metal in the air?

27:06.167 --> 27:10.296
The stink of 20,000 souls

27:10.379 --> 27:13.757
crammed into a shelter
designed for half that number?

27:13.840 --> 27:16.177
Don't talk about the past!

27:16.260 --> 27:17.886
You mean the future.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.430
I mean stop talking.

27:19.513 --> 27:22.140
Do you guys remember
when the reveille bell rang

27:22.224 --> 27:26.728
at the exact moment
the dome in shelter 41 collapsed?

27:26.812 --> 27:30.023
It was exactly at 0600...

27:30.106 --> 27:33.444
almost like cause and effect.

27:34.945 --> 27:40.492
The bell rang and woke everyone up
a split second before they died.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.040
As a boy, I remember thinking...

27:48.166 --> 27:50.627
"That's so unfair."

27:53.797 --> 27:55.549
Philip, keep your mouth shut.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.843
I'm not sure that I can.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.136
Philip...

28:00.221 --> 28:02.556
-Philip! Philip, you can.
-I'll try.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.807
Philip?

28:03.890 --> 28:06.142
I'll try. I'll try. I'll try. I'll try.

28:06.227 --> 28:08.729
-Philip!
-I'll try. I'll try...

28:09.938 --> 28:11.147
<i>Philip?</i>

28:12.358 --> 28:13.942
<i>- Philip!</i>

28:19.906 --> 28:21.157
Philip?

28:26.079 --> 28:27.706
Philip!

28:51.313 --> 28:53.482
Where are you guys?

28:58.445 --> 29:00.781

I just sent you the address of the yard.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.942
<i>Well, it's a start.</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:21.194
<i>What about 911 records?</i>
<i>EMT calls?</i>

30:21.277 --> 30:23.697
Nothing. I've also tried
virtually every emergency room

30:23.780 --> 30:25.324
in the Pacific Northwest.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.033
Are you sure you don't want me
to call Agent Forbes?

30:27.117 --> 30:28.827
No, he's got enough on his plate.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.287
<i>Okay. It's just that he's asked me</i>
<i>to keep him updated on everything--</i>

30:31.372 --> 30:32.373
I said I was sure, Beth.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.040
How many fucking times
do you need me to say it?

30:36.126 --> 30:38.420
I'm sorry. I'm having a bad day.

Come on! Yeah! Finally!

31:00.484 --> 31:02.778
I've really been looking forward
to this, Mr. Giant.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.821
Thank you so much.

31:07.949 --> 31:11.453
I just hate being the last guy picked,
you know?

31:11.537 --> 31:12.996
Drives me crazy.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.498
I'm sure a guy like you understands.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.999
Back soon!

31:29.054 --> 31:30.055
Sweet ride.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.519
Hey, are we going up or down?

31:35.602 --> 31:36.853
I'm gonna guess down.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.732
Up? You son of a bitch! You got me!

31:50.283 --> 31:52.202
Can I help you?

31:52.285 --> 31:54.204
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.
I'm with the FBI.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.497
I'm looking for a silver van.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.124
It was brought here yesterday
about 3:30 in the afternoon.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.502
Oh, the one that got T-boned
by the Peterbilt?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.463
T-boned by the...

32:02.546 --> 32:04.089
Yeah. Sure. Show me.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.424
Uh...

32:05.507 --> 32:08.301
- Hey, FBI doing traffic accidents now?
- No.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.470
Well, what's this about?

32:09.553 --> 32:12.263
It's about you showing me the van
and not asking anymore goddamn questions.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.349
Oh... 'Kay.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.477
There she is. Total write-off.

32:23.484 --> 32:26.069
Do you know if any of the occupants
were badly hurt?

32:26.152 --> 32:27.654
Oh, we don't get reports on the incident.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.491
Uh, the airbags went off,
I can tell you that.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.746
Okay. Thanks for your time.

32:35.829 --> 32:38.749
Uh, you wanna dust it for prints
or hit it with a blue light or nothin'?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.250
Knock yourself out.

32:42.503 --> 32:45.589
Wow! This is great up here.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.467
Nice big space, daylight.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.139
That's a big old CRT.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.932
I'm guessing...

32:56.016 --> 32:57.142
late '90s.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.900
Those flat-screen
sons of guns are heavy, huh?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.151
Probably not so much for you.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.529
I bet you didn't even need help
from your friends.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.489
You do have friends, right?

33:13.116 --> 33:16.119
Are they government,
or is this a private contractor gig?

33:19.831 --> 33:23.376
Whoa, a question on the TV!
I love it.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.754
It's like that show my mom watches
after supper.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.549
You know, most people would ask,
"Where are you from?"

33:28.632 --> 33:31.426
But, hey, I don't want to offend anybody,
if English is a second language.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.344
Maybe it's a typo, huh?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.810
What a coincidence!
I was gonna ask the same thing,

33:39.893 --> 33:42.646
since you're the ones
who brought me here, but, hey,

33:42.729 --> 33:44.773
like my humanities teacher,
Mr. Warchowski, says,

33:44.856 --> 33:46.692
"Why are we all here?" Right?

33:51.196 --> 33:52.488
Guess.

33:55.491 --> 33:58.203
'Kay, technically,
I'll be 18 in October,

33:58.286 --> 34:00.080
but I'm kind of an old soul.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.332
What about you, Mr. Giant?
When's your birthday?

34:07.462 --> 34:08.797
Back when I was starting quarterback,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.091
our mission was to win the division,
obviously.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.135
You look like you played some
ball in your day, Mr. Giant.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.805
But then again...

34:18.765 --> 34:21.142
a deaf-mute like yourself

34:21.226 --> 34:23.854
wouldn't be able to hear
the quarterback call plays,

34:23.937 --> 34:25.021
would he?

34:27.357 --> 34:28.358
Oh!

34:31.945 --> 34:33.905
I'll catch you later, man!

34:38.952 --> 34:40.370
What did you say to them?

34:40.453 --> 34:42.748
I got 'em right where I want 'em.

34:42.831 --> 34:43.999
Excuse me.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.049
Officer Boyd? Got a second?

34:53.133 --> 34:55.051
Sure. Excuse me.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.101
-What about the--
-CCTV is down.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.728
What the hell are you doing here?

35:04.811 --> 35:07.397
I thought I made it very clear last time
that you were not to communicate--

35:07.480 --> 35:09.816
Yeah, well, fuck Protocol 6.
My team is missing.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.694
-For how long?
-Since yesterday morning.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.613
Apparently.
I just found out about it a while ago.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.032
All of them!
Their coms and locators are offline.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.408
They don't show up on GPS.

35:18.491 --> 35:21.202
-What about the Deep Web backchannel?
-It's the first place I looked!

35:21.286 --> 35:23.079
There's no sign of them.
It's like they've disappeared.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.206
The FBI has far more resources than I do.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.583
I'm running a facial recognition
search through the NSA.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.169
Which could take forever,
if it works at all.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.796
I know! But what else can I do?

35:30.879 --> 35:34.465
They've all been previously red-flagged...
by the previous me.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.677
I found their vehicle in a salvage yard.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.846
It had been T-boned
by a Vanderbilt or some damn thing.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.597
Trail ends there, I'm guessing?

35:43.558 --> 35:45.393
Okay, you need to consider
the possibility

35:45.476 --> 35:47.520
that they've been taken
out of the equation.

35:47.603 --> 35:48.647
What equation?

35:49.605 --> 35:50.732
The director's.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.152
I've seen entire teams
I was supposed to work on a mission with

35:54.235 --> 35:56.154
just disappear into thin air.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.658
Probably taken out
by another traveler team under orders.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.452
You know as well as I do,
the future has the ultimate power over us.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.370
If the director doesn't like
the way we perform,

36:04.454 --> 36:05.997
- a decision will be made.
- Why them?

36:06.081 --> 36:07.708
I'm responsible for my team's actions.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.210
Well, how badly have you fucked up lately?
Maybe you're next.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.212
I don't buy that.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.756
What do you want from me?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.632
My team has been tasked to participate
in a mission

36:16.717 --> 36:19.427
that requires six people,
minimum, to pull it off.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.636
-When?
-Tonight.

36:20.721 --> 36:22.555
That's what you're here about?
You want my team's help?

36:22.638 --> 36:24.975
-The mission comes first.
-The mission's canceled, MacLaren!

36:25.058 --> 36:26.226
You just don't get it yet.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.562
- Thanks for your help.
- Hold on.

36:31.647 --> 36:32.899
If you get a real lead...

36:33.859 --> 36:35.902
I will help you go after them, okay?
I'll help you.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.570
But if I'm right,
and it's the director, then--

36:37.653 --> 36:38.947
I know.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.156
I hope I'm wrong.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.999
Torture doesn't work, people.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.291
It's been proven!

36:50.375 --> 36:52.210
You know, whoever you are,

36:52.293 --> 36:54.379
whatever information
you think you're getting...

36:54.462 --> 36:57.173
is of almost no value.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.437
Philip.

37:11.521 --> 37:12.898
His name is Philip.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.608
He was in the van with me when we were...

37:21.364 --> 37:23.241
I don't understand the question.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.243
I mean, if you're asking how old--

37:26.411 --> 37:27.913
No! No!

38:17.545 --> 38:19.089
Where's the rest of your team?

38:19.172 --> 38:21.132
MIA!
We have to cancel the mission.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.300
What about all those people?

38:22.383 --> 38:25.804
I was hoping the director would send you
a replacement team, but...

38:25.887 --> 38:27.097
Maybe there's still a way.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.015
No, no. Forget it, the mission's canceled.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.434
The director will have an alternative.
We have to trust that.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.145
I'm sorry about your team.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.314
I haven't given up just yet.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.504
There's no way they can do the mission
with so few personnel.

39:01.882 --> 39:03.508
All those people are gonna die.

39:04.592 --> 39:05.886
They already did.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.222
We just weren't there
to prevent it from happening.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.893
Just hope the boss
isn't in the same situation

39:12.976 --> 39:14.519
as we are somewhere.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.272
I have an idea
that could end this,

39:17.355 --> 39:19.732
if the opportunity presents itself again.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.194
But I want everyone to decide.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.946
We may not be better off.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.033
I say go for it.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.409
How?

39:29.492 --> 39:31.995
-You're gonna try to talk me out of it.
-Why?

39:32.078 --> 39:33.454
It's insane.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.087
Marcy!

39:41.171 --> 39:43.256
Philip? You're alive?

39:46.176 --> 39:48.678
I saw... I saw you die. They showed me.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.097
-No, I'm right here.
-No, on the television. They...

39:51.181 --> 39:52.598
they shot you in the chest.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.809
No, no, no, Marcy, Marcy,
he's right in front of you.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.937
Marcy, look at me.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.397
You were in those clothes,
you were slumped over...

39:59.480 --> 40:01.816
- Oh, this is good.
- What? How?

40:01.900 --> 40:02.943
Think about it!

40:03.026 --> 40:04.903
They probably don't even have Carly's kid!

40:04.986 --> 40:07.989
They're just pushing buttons
and seeing what happens.

40:08.073 --> 40:11.117
I don't know who, but this still gives us
power that we don't have much of.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.285
We don't have any power.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.413
Please?

40:16.539 --> 40:17.540
Please...

40:18.374 --> 40:20.501
Before you take him away, would you...

40:35.391 --> 40:36.517
Hang on!

42:44.479 --> 42:46.397
Jesus Christ!

42:55.156 --> 42:57.242
- He's alive.
- He's cold. Dead for hours.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.368
Gotta get 'em out of here.

43:01.121 --> 43:02.830
Look for a key!
Check his pockets!

43:05.458 --> 43:06.959
- I got it! I got it!
- Got it?

43:18.304 --> 43:19.472
Carly!

43:20.390 --> 43:21.557
Carly.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.601
She's unconscious.
Good strong pulse, though.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.229
It's me. I'm here.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.647
You're late.

43:28.481 --> 43:29.649
Won't happen again.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.567
Gonna get you outta here, okay?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.528
How many days?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.070
Three.

43:35.155 --> 43:37.198
I had to end it.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.325
What was this about?
Why did he do it?

43:39.409 --> 43:41.494
Wasn't him. He was a hired gun.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.037
Never found out who it was.

43:43.121 --> 43:44.997
I'm gonna get you out of this.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.541
Wait. What about the mission?

43:46.624 --> 43:48.543
No, it's canceled.
I couldn't do it without you.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.128
There was... no way.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.131
What? What is it?

43:56.008 --> 43:58.761
What if that's what this was about?
