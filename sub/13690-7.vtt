Match-day temperament.
I've never had it.

00:31.803 --> 00:33.888
I'm not sure I'm ready, Golly.

00:33.971 --> 00:38.267
I was the same my
first time in charge.
But you listen up, son.

00:38.351 --> 00:43.606
Walk tall, walk straight
and look the world
right in the eye.

00:43.689 --> 00:47.527
Right.
That's good. Who said that?

00:47.610 --> 00:49.862
One of the giants
of Celtic culture.

00:49.946 --> 00:52.949
What's his name?
The... Robert the Bruce.

00:53.991 --> 00:55.368
Rabbie Burns?

00:56.369 --> 00:59.705
Val Doonican.

00:59.789 --> 01:03.000
KATRINA: First of all,
I would like to thank
the Returning Officer

01:03.084 --> 01:08.923
and all those who have made
this election, and count, such
a smooth and efficient one.

01:09.006 --> 01:14.011
My victory today
marks a defining
moment in Scottish politics.

01:16.556 --> 01:18.182

Today,
sunshine with showers...

02:07.065 --> 02:11.485
Hello? Maureen,
I'm just on my way. What?

02:12.862 --> 02:14.447
Oh, no.

02:15.782 --> 02:18.493
No, no,
if you're sick, you're sick.

02:18.576 --> 02:20.953
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

02:21.036 --> 02:23.706
You take care of yourself.
Bye.

02:29.420 --> 02:31.631
I don't quite get
the point in this, Arch.

02:31.714 --> 02:33.925
You're supposed
to be the expert
in the menu department.

02:34.008 --> 02:36.302
First course,
fresh Scottish salmon.

02:36.385 --> 02:39.555
Second course,
fresh Scottish grouse.

02:39.639 --> 02:43.684
You'll be looking
forward to seeing
your posh totty.

02:43.768 --> 02:47.104
-Oh, there's one!
-Lexie, be quiet or
I'll send you home.

02:48.022 --> 02:49.524
Sorry, Dad.

02:49.607 --> 02:52.443
And I won't take
you racing down
to London either.

02:54.654 --> 02:55.780
Whoa!

03:33.192 --> 03:36.612
Ah. I love the smell of
cordite in the morning.

03:36.696 --> 03:38.740
(CHUCKLING)

03:38.823 --> 03:41.993
Do you know, I can remember
my first Glorious Twelfth
like it was yesterday.

03:42.076 --> 03:46.706
August, 1938.
Old house was packed.

03:46.789 --> 03:50.543
Bishops, bandleaders,
King of Bulgaria.
Prime Minister, too.

03:50.626 --> 03:53.546
Old Neville Chamberlain
came here on his way to
suck up to Hitler.

03:53.629 --> 03:58.008
Hector, we need to get going.
The lad's got to leave
with the birds in an hour.

03:58.092 --> 04:01.136
-Shall I start
the beaters off?
-No, no, no.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.181
No, Duncan, I'll do that.

04:05.475 --> 04:06.768
Here.

04:08.895 --> 04:10.438
You take these.

04:28.121 --> 04:32.168
-Morning. First customer, eh?
-Sorry?

04:32.251 --> 04:34.212
Well, you've come to vote?

04:34.295 --> 04:37.799
-No need to ask who for.
-Might as well.

04:42.970 --> 04:45.264
-A race, you say?
-Yes.

04:45.348 --> 04:47.892
With dead grouse
as the competitors?

04:47.975 --> 04:51.437
Could you possibly
direct me towards
the point of this exercise?

04:51.521 --> 04:53.147
It's organised by
a food magazine.

04:53.231 --> 04:55.316
The first restaurant to serve
grouse to a customer on the

04:55.400 --> 04:56.984
first day of the
shooting season

04:57.068 --> 04:59.737
wins Â£5,000 and
a feature in the next edition.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.407
What an extraordinarily
stupid idea.

05:02.490 --> 05:04.325
What do you mean,
food magazine?

05:04.409 --> 05:06.661
Well, it'd be great
publicity for the restaurant.

05:06.744 --> 05:09.705
You know, the new business
I'm supposed to be
running with my girlfriend?

05:09.789 --> 05:12.792
Meanwhile, the smooth
running of the household is
disrupted once again.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.711
I can't wait to
get cracking in
a proper kitchen for a change.

05:15.795 --> 05:17.755
The last time
Lexie went AWOL...

05:17.839 --> 05:21.217
When my Aunt
Maggie had the temerity
to expire suddenly, you mean?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.802
Golly prepared dinner.

05:22.885 --> 05:25.012
He presented me with an
omelette that looked and

05:25.096 --> 05:27.807
tasted like a
polystyrene tile.

05:51.873 --> 05:54.875
Breakfast. Eat.

05:54.959 --> 05:57.628
-You're a poppet.
-I try to please.

05:57.712 --> 05:59.380
And you do.

06:01.674 --> 06:03.551
You worried?

06:03.634 --> 06:05.970
I just hope
everything goes okay
with Archie and the...

06:06.053 --> 06:09.515
Course it will.
Two cooks in the kitchen,
it'll be a breeze.

06:11.225 --> 06:14.353
I didn't quite mean that.

06:14.437 --> 06:18.316
Listen, Lennie, these last
couple of months, I'd never
have got by without you.

06:19.650 --> 06:22.403
I mean it. I'm very grateful.

06:26.741 --> 06:29.494
No worries. But thanks.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.461
Delicious.

06:45.885 --> 06:48.679
Archie, I was just
going to call you. Listen...

06:48.763 --> 06:52.683
You mustn't canvass voters on
their way to exercise their
democratic prerogative,

06:52.767 --> 06:54.852
even if it is just
a council election.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.235
Archie MacDonald.

07:07.156 --> 07:08.366
Thanks.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.922
Archie, I need your help.
Maureen's let me down.

07:23.005 --> 07:25.133
She was gonna help
me organise the day.

07:25.216 --> 07:27.510
-Get the vote out and that.
-I can't, sorry.

07:28.386 --> 07:30.221
You can't or you won't?

07:30.304 --> 07:34.600
-Katrina, I won't be here.
I'm going to London.
-Oh.

07:34.684 --> 07:37.061
You going to see Justine?

07:37.145 --> 07:39.772
Yeah,
I will be seeing Justine.

07:39.856 --> 07:44.068
-Well, have a terrific time.
-Thanks.

07:45.486 --> 07:48.281
I'll just have to find
somebody else, won't I?

07:48.364 --> 07:50.491
Look, I've said I'm sorry.

07:50.575 --> 07:52.827
Could you tell me
how you voted, please?

07:52.910 --> 07:54.537
Well, why would
I tell you that?

07:54.620 --> 07:56.748
It's standard procedure
in elections.

07:56.831 --> 07:59.625
It helps the parties
keep check on
how they're doing.

07:59.709 --> 08:03.171
No, I'm not gonna
tell you how I voted.
That's my business.

08:03.254 --> 08:05.798
-You didn't vote
for me, did you?
-Listen, you...

08:16.476 --> 08:19.729
-Good luck, my boy.
-And you.
Smash the opposition, okay?

08:19.812 --> 08:21.147
Yes!

-Yeah, great.

08:49.842 --> 08:53.471
Ah, may the best man win.

09:11.197 --> 09:12.949
I wish you all happy hunting

09:13.032 --> 09:16.452
and leave you
in the very capable
hands of Duncan here.

09:19.414 --> 09:23.376
Thanks, Hec... Mr MacDonald.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.674
Gentlemen, I earnestly hope...

09:29.757 --> 09:33.302
that you have very
good sport here today.

09:35.805 --> 09:38.599
There's loads of
birds out there.

09:38.683 --> 09:42.562
The hills are alive,
you might say.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.234
Anyway,
if you're ready, we'll...

09:49.527 --> 09:52.572
mosey on out.

09:52.655 --> 09:56.284
Well done, Duncan.
That was jolly good.
Now give 'em hell.

09:58.327 --> 10:00.121
Earnestly hope!

10:04.125 --> 10:07.837
Kilwillie,
I thought you had some
fool election today?

10:07.920 --> 10:12.216
Democracy's important,
my dear,
but not that important.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.552
Anyway, the political
machine's well-oiled.

10:14.635 --> 10:16.387
What with? Your filthy lucre?

10:16.471 --> 10:21.726
Nothing so gross! A few
cases of Kilwillie old malt.

10:21.809 --> 10:24.228
Kilwillie, that's corruption.

10:24.312 --> 10:27.106
No, my dear. That's politics.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.442
So, shall we to the butts?

10:40.495 --> 10:42.830
Look, everything's dead wee.

10:50.713 --> 10:54.092
-Confident, then?
-Publicly, I'm unbeatable.

10:54.175 --> 11:00.014
Privately,
I'm gonna get smashed.
Morning, Mrs McCann.

11:00.098 --> 11:03.392
There's one vote I didn't get.
If I get beaten here...

11:03.476 --> 11:06.479
You won't.
You've done your canvassing,
haven't you?

11:06.562 --> 11:09.857
Then it's all about getting
the vote out on the day.
Show me your returns.

11:09.941 --> 11:12.985
-Don't you have
to get on your way?
-No. Why?

11:13.069 --> 11:15.947
I thought you said you were on
important party business.

11:16.030 --> 11:19.951
So I am. But I prefer to
think it's mostly private.

11:20.034 --> 11:24.038
-You mean you came
all this way to...
-Yes, to help you.

11:26.207 --> 11:29.377
Oh, Alan, thank you.

11:29.460 --> 11:33.256
Well,
I like to think of myself
as your political mentor,

11:33.339 --> 11:38.219
and of you in a, well,
rather more intimate role.

11:40.304 --> 11:43.099
Now, let's go and
win this election.

11:43.599 --> 11:44.892
Right.

11:50.565 --> 11:52.817
We're making good time.

12:05.163 --> 12:06.956
He's got all the early voters.

12:07.039 --> 12:10.835
So how exactly is
the intellectual giant
in plus-fours?

12:10.918 --> 12:13.880
Kilwillie?
He's smarter than he looks.

12:13.963 --> 12:16.382
He's diversified
into luxury foods.

12:16.466 --> 12:19.802
Everything from
whisky marmalade
to venison pate.

12:19.886 --> 12:23.097
-He employs a lot of people.
-Who'll all vote for him.

12:23.181 --> 12:26.642
Still, looks from these
like you might pick up
most of the OAP vote.

12:26.726 --> 12:29.353
-I'm pleased about that.
-Well, it's often the way.

12:29.437 --> 12:31.898
Old ladies usually
admire female candidates.

12:31.981 --> 12:33.941
Old blokes just fancy them.

12:34.025 --> 12:36.069
As long as they're not
complete dogs, of course.

12:36.152 --> 12:37.612
-Alan!
-Oh, sorry.

12:37.695 --> 12:40.531
Gratuitous use of
politically incorrect term.

12:40.615 --> 12:43.367
So, when are
the oldies going to vote?

12:43.451 --> 12:45.536
Most of them said they
were going to go tonight.

12:45.620 --> 12:49.373
Well, that's no good.
Tonight they'll be
watching Gardeners' World

12:49.457 --> 12:53.294
or fretting about the mass
murderers stalking the mean
streets of Glenbogle.

12:53.377 --> 12:55.838
You've got to get them
voting during the day.

12:55.922 --> 13:00.426
I can't get them lifts during
the day. People round here are
really busy just now.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.428

-Oh, aye.

17:03.503 --> 17:06.589
Even if we were in a Ferrari,
we still wouldn't make
it in time for lunch.

17:06.672 --> 17:09.258
Time, travel expenses.
Let's say 300.

17:09.342 --> 17:11.551
No, let's say 150.

17:13.179 --> 17:15.723
No, every year
the club organises a tour

17:15.807 --> 17:19.769
and we all take a week
off work to go and do wheelies
in some far-off place.

17:19.852 --> 17:21.521
We're very
grateful for your help.

17:21.604 --> 17:24.147
If there's anything we can do
to reimburse your expenses?

17:24.232 --> 17:26.275
Oh, not at all,
wouldn't hear of it.

17:26.358 --> 17:29.237
No, no, we'll simply
finish off the list
and then be on our way.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.739
We want to make Loch
Ness before teatime.

17:41.374 --> 17:44.752
That would have looked
a bit odd on the election
expenses return.

-If they will
march into Poland.
-Quite.

17:54.470 --> 17:58.141
There are some things
up with which
one shall not put.

18:00.059 --> 18:02.687
They'll all melt.
Such a waste.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.729
Just great.

18:04.814 --> 18:08.443
Och, Saturn Rockets!
Oh, I've not had these
since I was a wee girl.

18:20.663 --> 18:23.624
Thank you, sir.
See you this evening.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.626
-Bye.
-How's it looking?

18:25.710 --> 18:28.755
Packed. Word's got
round the exiles, I think.

18:28.838 --> 18:31.591
-This Lesley...
-Lexie.

18:31.674 --> 18:34.469
She is only gonna do
her nauseating
national dish, right?

18:34.552 --> 18:38.014
Because you've never
cooked grouse before.
Yes, that's the arrangement.

18:38.097 --> 18:40.641
And you're sure she
won't meddle? Because I won't
have it, Justine.

18:40.725 --> 18:43.269
You know me, I'm a pussycat,
but if anyone
comes into my kitchen

18:43.352 --> 18:45.772
-and starts messing around...
-Lennie,
it's not gonna happen.

18:45.855 --> 18:48.858
Trust me.
Anyway, you'll like her.

18:48.941 --> 18:51.778
She's very nice,
in an up-front sort of way.

(PHONE RINGING)

18:57.116 --> 18:59.494
Good morning, Flying Fish.

18:59.577 --> 19:01.746
Archie. Are you nearly here?

19:03.081 --> 19:06.667
What? Where?

19:08.795 --> 19:12.507
-Archie...
-We're all okay,
in case you were wondering.

19:12.590 --> 19:15.802
-Yes, Justine,
I know that very well.
-That his missus, is it?

19:15.885 --> 19:18.513
-She wants to be.
-I appreciate that.

19:18.596 --> 19:20.640
Starting as she means
to go on, isn't she?

19:20.723 --> 19:22.725
Why don't you tell her to
get stuffed, get off the

19:22.809 --> 19:25.978
phone,
get some housework done?

19:26.062 --> 19:28.815
-What did they say?
-Nothing,
um, I'll tell you later.

19:29.816 --> 19:31.984
So what will you
do about lunch?

19:32.068 --> 19:34.612
What I normally do
when you let me down.

19:34.695 --> 19:38.866
Hope Lennie can pull
a rabbit out of the hat. In
this case, almost literally.

19:43.538 --> 19:47.792
Don't say anything. Just get
into that kitchen and do
whatever you have to do.

-What did the fireman's
wife get for Christmas?
-I don't know.

20:26.873 --> 20:29.250
What did the fireman's
wife get for Christmas?

20:29.333 --> 20:34.839
A ladder in her stocking.
So where are we now?

20:34.922 --> 20:38.301
-Watford.
-The ruby in the belly

They're talking, I think.

Typical. Let me have a look.

20:57.153 --> 20:59.405
Fascinating reading, are they?

20:59.489 --> 21:02.825

others pore over mucky books.

Me,
I go for canvassing returns.

I could never get
you this interested
in me when we were together.

21:11.167 --> 21:13.127
Maybe I have
repented at leisure.

21:16.380 --> 21:20.134
HECTOR: They're getting out,
they're getting out.
KILWILLIE: What's he doing?

21:23.137 --> 21:27.141
-Getting some mineral water.
Typical.
-Let me see.

-Hi.

22:02.677 --> 22:04.595

through to the kitchen?

Lennie. Head chef.
Come into my kitchen.

22:23.698 --> 22:27.285
Nice place, Archie.
I painted me
mam's lav that colour.

22:32.039 --> 22:34.041
You've changed everything.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.794
-No, I haven't.
-Yes, you have.

22:36.878 --> 22:41.424
The paintings, the colour
scheme, the tablecloths.
It's completely different.

22:41.507 --> 22:45.428
Don't be ridiculous.
The customers like it.

22:45.511 --> 22:48.222
And my aquarium.
Where is my aquarium?

22:48.306 --> 22:49.974
-It had to go.
-Why?

22:50.057 --> 22:52.685
One of the piranhas bit
Terry's hand when he was
cleaning out the tank.

22:52.769 --> 22:54.312
So what have you
done with them?

22:54.395 --> 22:56.773
The wound went septic.
Terry had to be
off work for a week.

-What?

-Oh, not down the...
-No.

-Well, where?
-Just by London Bridge.

the way they swam off.

the most ecologically
sound thing to do,

23:11.245 --> 23:13.164
but they were free at last,

-I think we'd better get going

for this
evening's performance.

you've done this.

believe you walk in here
for the first time in months

of them voting yet.

are working today.
-They're unemployed.

-Casual work. They're
beating up on the hill.
-I beg your pardon?

-For the grouse shooting.
-Ah, the bizarre feudal relic.

They are not.
Wild Atlantic salmon,

the crystal waters of the
River Bogle, by your boss.

salmon gets this big.
Taste's gone.

talking 100% fish droppings.
-Archie.

25:13.493 --> 25:16.079
Sorry, boss.

a professional opinion.

25:16.162 --> 25:18.623
There's a lot of
paperwork to get through.

25:20.041 --> 25:22.835
I could chop them
into steaks, I suppose.

25:22.919 --> 25:27.215
Okay. I think the flavour's
more delicate if they're cut
into fillets myself.

25:27.298 --> 25:29.175
-But it's...
-Yeah?

25:29.258 --> 25:30.760
Well, why don't you leave
the delicate
flavours to me, sweetie,

grips with the grice, eh?

-What?

25:45.358 --> 25:47.443
What did the grape say
when the gorilla stood on it?

25:47.527 --> 25:49.445
Nothing.
It just gave a little "wine".

Be with you in a minute.

-What?

-Well, that I...
Well, you know...
-Don't be ridiculous, man.

Do you honestly
think a wife of mine
would vote for a woman?

26:28.067 --> 26:30.236
Don't you worry your
little bald head, Kilwillie.

26:30.319 --> 26:34.574
-I voted according
to my conscience.
-Thank you so much, Molly.

26:36.117 --> 26:37.702
Well, see you boys later.

26:37.785 --> 26:40.997

in the motor all day,
get some fresh air.

She's a wonderful girl.
You're a lucky dog, Hector.

26:46.836 --> 26:48.087
Yeah.

26:49.046 --> 26:51.090
Well, I did it.

26:51.174 --> 26:54.761
For the first time in my life,
I exercised my
democratic right

26:54.844 --> 27:00.099
according to my own
convictions rather than my
husband's prejudices.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.018
I put a cross
against your name.

27:02.101 --> 27:04.687
Really, Molly? Thank you.

27:05.646 --> 27:07.273
See, I told you.

27:07.356 --> 27:10.276
(SIGHING) Truly liberating.

27:10.359 --> 27:13.821

syndicate were very taken
with your leaflets.

-Tell me, are you winning?
-I hope so.

what time are the beaters
on the hill finishing?

27:21.537 --> 27:24.874
-Oh,
about 6:00, I should think.
-Plenty of time to vote, then.

but I'd rather you had it.

slurped the old fire water.

and I'll give you
a grouse butty, okay?

you can keep it.

bored in my life.

28:10.044 --> 28:12.839

I must say.

28:12.922 --> 28:15.591

have better things
to do, Kilwillie.

28:15.675 --> 28:17.677
As have you and me.

of the Glorious Twelfth.

28:20.763 --> 28:23.891
Well, the opposition
does seem rather inactive.

28:23.975 --> 28:26.853
Perhaps we could spare
just a couple of hours.

28:26.936 --> 28:28.229
Splendid.

28:36.362 --> 28:38.030
Wait for it.

28:39.115 --> 28:41.242
Wait for it.

28:42.869 --> 28:44.245
Go.

-Uh?
-What she means is that...

Now.

We're about to...

-We're going to do it for you.
-What, you?

29:34.504 --> 29:37.006
Oh, come on, Gary,
it's hardly rocket science.

a stick and screaming

This is the profit and
loss account for June.

30:49.454 --> 30:52.915
-We made
a thumping great deficit?
-No.

30:52.999 --> 30:56.294
Don't you remember,
we make the loan
repayments every quarter?

30:56.377 --> 30:59.255
Once that figure
there is amortised
over the other months,

30:59.338 --> 31:01.758
we were in profit, just.

31:01.841 --> 31:04.260
Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot.
A bit rusty.

31:04.343 --> 31:07.054
Well, that's good.
Great, in fact.

31:07.138 --> 31:09.724
Thank you, O Master.

31:09.807 --> 31:12.351
It hasn't been easy,
but everyone's
pulled together.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.686
Yeah.

31:15.146 --> 31:18.316
Oh,
Justine, I miss this place.

31:18.399 --> 31:22.904
-Do you? Really?
-And you.

31:22.987 --> 31:25.531
Well, get yourself
back down here, then.

31:25.615 --> 31:26.949
I will.

31:28.826 --> 31:30.078
I will.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.003
It's showtime.

31:58.981 --> 32:03.486
Everyone wants the grouse.
How's it going?

32:03.569 --> 32:06.906
The oven's just not hot enough
and I can't get it any higher.
I told him.

32:06.989 --> 32:09.117
-I'm using all the others.
-The birds just
aren't cooking.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.828
This is a simmering oven.
Lennie, what
the hell are you playing at?

32:11.911 --> 32:13.371
-Come on, Archie.
-Stop messing about

32:13.454 --> 32:15.415
and give Lexie
an oven to cook in.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.333
Now you listen to me, mate...

32:20.044 --> 32:23.381
Come on,
there are customers waiting.

32:44.694 --> 32:48.281
Oh! Watch out!

32:48.364 --> 32:49.949
You stupid cow.

32:50.032 --> 32:53.244
What did you call me?
You puffed up bag
of antipodean wind.

32:53.327 --> 32:56.664
-That is it, I've had enough!
-And it's high time
someone stuck a pin in you.

32:56.748 --> 32:58.958
-Come on, guys.
-An accident,
these things happen.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.169
No more favours, Justine.
She goes or I walk.

33:01.252 --> 33:03.254
-Lennie...
-I mean it.

33:03.337 --> 33:05.715
-It's my kitchen.
I will not have her in it!
-Oh, for heaven's sake!

33:05.798 --> 33:09.385
That's just because I showed
you up for the talentless ego
merchant that you are.

33:09.469 --> 33:12.096
Who's it to be? Her or me?

33:12.180 --> 33:14.766
Okay. I'm sorry, Lexie.

33:16.434 --> 33:19.395
Justine,
this is not your decision.

33:19.479 --> 33:23.316
Yes, it is. And pick those
birds up. Someone's got to
eat them in a minute.

33:29.447 --> 33:31.949
-Justine, we run this
restaurant together...
-No, we don't!

33:32.033 --> 33:35.078
We used to till you went off
to your Highland
fastness to play chieftain.

33:35.161 --> 33:38.164
Now I run it
with a lot of help
and support from Lennie.

33:38.247 --> 33:40.416
Oh, yeah, what kind of help
and support would that be?

33:40.500 --> 33:42.960
Maybe the same kind
as you get from Lexie.
Or Katrina.

33:43.044 --> 33:46.339
Or whichever
other Highland lassie
you're tossing the caber with!

33:46.422 --> 33:48.674
Look,
Justine, we are partners.

33:48.758 --> 33:50.885
We used to be, Archie.

33:50.968 --> 33:55.014
But maybe, as the
old song says, it's time
to call the whole thing off.

33:57.850 --> 34:01.938
Evening. Excuse me, pet.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.901
You know, my dad...

34:08.610 --> 34:10.321
used to build ships.

34:13.741 --> 34:15.451
I sell ice cream.

34:16.994 --> 34:21.165
Mr Slurpy at your service.

34:28.464 --> 34:30.216
Is this, like, dinner theatre?

34:33.386 --> 34:36.222
Marvellous day.
Well done, Duncan.
Jolly good show.

34:36.304 --> 34:38.014
Thanks very much, Hector.

34:40.184 --> 34:41.686
-Ha.
-Right.

34:41.768 --> 34:44.105
I must be off,
compose my victory speech.

34:46.315 --> 34:48.359
Jolly good
beaters you found, too.

34:48.443 --> 34:52.655
I tell you what, give them
this fiver, tell them to
have a drink on me.

34:55.241 --> 34:58.578
That'll be just the one drink
between all of them, will it?

34:59.370 --> 35:01.581
Gaz! Gaz!

35:02.498 --> 35:04.333
Hey, boys.

35:18.181 --> 35:19.599
Aye.

35:21.017 --> 35:23.144
Yes.

35:23.227 --> 35:25.688
You can say that again.

35:25.772 --> 35:30.443
But don't,
I've got a terrible headache.

35:30.526 --> 35:34.447
I suppose I could go
back in there and apologise.
Say it was all my fault.

35:34.530 --> 35:40.161
Oh, Archie, son, it's around
these small moments
whole lives hinge.

35:40.244 --> 35:44.373
-What?
-I speak from experience, man.

35:44.457 --> 35:46.876
12 years since I
caught the bus to Blyth,

35:46.959 --> 35:50.129
and I was daft enough
to sit next to
a lass who smiled at us.

35:50.213 --> 35:54.342
If only I'd had
another half in the Fat Ox
or the bus had been late,

35:54.425 --> 35:59.346
or I'd sat in
the back with me Chronicle,
like I usually did,

35:59.430 --> 36:03.684
I'd have been spared
a lifetime of quiet misery

36:03.768 --> 36:07.814
with a large woman
with a very short temper.

36:08.815 --> 36:10.024
I see.

36:11.984 --> 36:14.903
If I was you,
I'd stay where you are,

36:14.986 --> 36:16.948
have some fun
with that Lexie lass.

36:17.030 --> 36:20.868
I tell you, man,
she fancies
the posh pants off you.

36:20.952 --> 36:25.123
Right, that's everything.
Next stop Euston.

36:30.962 --> 36:33.631
Like a well-oiled machine,
it was.

36:33.714 --> 36:37.093
Well, I'm glad the nice
gentlemen had a good day.

36:37.176 --> 36:40.221
Always been good tippers,
the Norwegians.

36:40.304 --> 36:42.640
I'll trouble you for my share.

36:45.977 --> 36:48.646
And I'll have my
binoculars back as well.

36:50.982 --> 36:53.192
Ah, you be a good lad
in the next 12 months

36:53.276 --> 36:57.029
and I'll let you play
with the train
set next year, too.

36:57.113 --> 36:58.281
Sweetie?

37:04.412 --> 37:08.624
Here, take it. You did well.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.918
Val Doonican
would be proud of you.

37:11.002 --> 37:14.964
-Walk tall, walk straight...
-And look
the world right in the eye.

37:15.047 --> 37:16.758
Bingo.

37:20.428 --> 37:23.097
-This is it.
-For both of us?

37:23.181 --> 37:26.642
It was the only
one they had left.
It's okay, I'll go on top.

37:28.061 --> 37:30.229
Bunk, that is.

37:30.313 --> 37:32.273
Should have left
that tequila alone.

37:32.356 --> 37:34.859
I'm starving, and all
that food we brought down...

37:34.942 --> 37:37.320
Don't worry, I nicked these.

37:37.403 --> 37:42.825
And the most expensive bottle
of red wine in your cellar.

37:42.909 --> 37:47.163
Ah. "And they dined on mince
and slices of quince."

37:47.246 --> 37:50.416
So, the husband says,
"I've just been
talking to the milkman

37:50.500 --> 37:53.628
"and he says he's
slept with every woman
in this street except one."

37:53.711 --> 37:58.132
-And the wife says...
-I bet it's that stuck
up cow from number 17!

37:58.216 --> 38:01.552
I absolutely hate
it when you do that.

38:05.306 --> 38:10.186
Well, here's to you,
and the start of
a glittering political career.

38:16.150 --> 38:17.944
Thanks, Alan.

38:19.153 --> 38:21.989
For everything.

38:22.073 --> 38:23.866
Isn't democracy wonderful?

38:26.411 --> 38:29.163
I love being a carnivore,
don't you?

38:29.247 --> 38:31.457
It's a bit overdone,
but it's not bad.

38:34.585 --> 38:37.463
Right, turn around.

38:39.632 --> 38:43.010
I'm going to retire.
It's been a long day.

38:45.221 --> 38:47.557
-Stop looking.
-I'm not looking.

38:47.640 --> 38:52.854
I am. Oh! My, Archie
MacDonald, Calvin Kleins.

38:59.610 --> 39:03.197
-Well, time to get
back to Edinburgh.
-Aye.

39:03.281 --> 39:07.034
-What time's the count start?
-8:00 in the morning.

39:07.118 --> 39:10.580
-Why don't you...
-Why don't I... After you.

39:10.663 --> 39:14.500
I was just gonna say,
why don't you stay? See it
through to the bitter end?

39:16.043 --> 39:17.837
Okay, thanks.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.590
But I'd better get my
head down. I've been up since
the crack of dawn.

39:20.673 --> 39:22.216
I'll get you a duvet.

39:34.103 --> 39:35.521
Okay, I'm listening.

39:36.814 --> 39:38.983
What's there to say, Archie?

39:40.943 --> 39:43.738
-What's there to say?
-I don't know.

39:46.115 --> 39:49.994
Just feels like it's gone.
The dream we had.

39:52.497 --> 39:55.208
It feels like someone's
taken a baseball bat to it.

39:57.126 --> 39:59.003
And maybe that someone is you.

40:02.673 --> 40:06.385
-Hello?
-Yeah,
I hear what you're saying.

40:06.469 --> 40:11.224
Don't say that. I hate
it when people say that.

40:11.307 --> 40:15.019
They mean, "I hear what you're
saying but I'm gonna do
naff all about it."

40:16.062 --> 40:17.397
No, I just meant...

40:17.480 --> 40:19.524
(STATIC OVER PHONE)

40:34.247 --> 40:36.999
Hello? Hello?

40:38.876 --> 40:40.336
I'm sorry, Arch.

40:41.838 --> 40:44.632
I bet you could
do with a cuddle.

40:44.715 --> 40:46.217
-I know I could.
-Lexie, no.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.052
It's okay.

40:48.136 --> 40:51.973
-This isn't wise.
-A cuddle, I said.
We've got our jim-jams on.

40:52.056 --> 40:55.101
Anyway, I'm freezing.
It's like Camp Three
on Everest up there.

40:55.184 --> 40:56.978
Your feet!
They're freezing, Lexie!

40:57.061 --> 40:58.771
Move over.

41:00.606 --> 41:04.902
There. Mmm. That's better.

41:12.869 --> 41:15.830
You know, I feel kind
of sorry for Justine.

41:17.498 --> 41:19.375
I mean, I know she's got
her faults, but everybody's

41:19.459 --> 41:22.336
got their faults,
haven't they?

41:22.420 --> 41:25.673
And you've got your faults.

41:25.757 --> 41:27.842
Even I've got faults.

41:31.179 --> 41:36.184
I just feel bad for her.
And she's losing
her man, isn't she?

41:37.101 --> 41:38.394
Maybe.

41:46.778 --> 41:50.740
Hey, Arch, what did one
ghost say to the other?

41:51.491 --> 41:53.409
Dunno.

41:53.493 --> 41:55.369
Do you believe in people?

41:56.245 --> 41:57.914
(DIALLING)

42:00.750 --> 42:04.212
We just never
really had a chance
to talk it through, you know.

42:04.295 --> 42:06.798
See how we feel,
reach common ground.

42:09.175 --> 42:11.427
That's important,
don't you think?

42:15.973 --> 42:19.102
It's okay, Lexie,
I always have this
effect on women in bed.

42:27.693 --> 42:29.153
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

42:33.658 --> 42:36.828
Hello? Hello?

42:48.923 --> 42:51.676
I'm sorry,
I didn't think, I was asleep.

42:52.760 --> 42:55.096
Whoever it was,
rang off anyway.

42:56.722 --> 42:58.599
I wonder who it was.

43:01.936 --> 43:03.813
Something wrong?

43:03.896 --> 43:08.276
Can't sleep.
Too excited. Too nervous.

43:08.359 --> 43:11.195
You'll walk it.
Just trust your Uncle Alan.

43:14.490 --> 43:17.243
You can be very sweet
when you put your
mind to it, you know.

43:17.326 --> 43:19.036
Is that supposed to be
a compliment?

43:19.120 --> 43:21.330
It's the only
one you're getting.

43:23.624 --> 43:26.878
So why don't you
stop messing about
and kiss me?

43:44.937 --> 43:47.982
What do you fancy?
Hot chocolate or Horlicks?

43:48.066 --> 43:51.778
It doesn't matter.
Just put some
bromide in it, will you?

44:32.985 --> 44:35.238
-Lexie.
-Well,
who did you think it was?

44:35.321 --> 44:37.156
We can't do this.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.742
Oh, you're not enjoying it,
is that what you're
trying to tell me?

44:39.826 --> 44:43.121
No, but... What are you doing?

44:43.204 --> 44:46.791
Where are we? I want to
know where it happened.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.544
Penrith!

44:49.627 --> 44:52.463
You know, that's where Bonnie
Prince Charlie fought his last
battle in England.

44:52.547 --> 44:54.757
Lexie, no, you're not
getting back in this bed.

44:54.841 --> 44:56.843
-Oh, come on.
-No.

44:56.926 --> 44:58.845
Think how you'd
feel in the morning.

44:58.928 --> 45:02.807
Oh, trust you to go all manly
and decisive at this
stage in the proceedings.

45:13.151 --> 45:15.403
Yes, but I've got
work to do this morning.

45:15.486 --> 45:19.198
Surely your golf column in
the Horse and Hound can
wait a few hours, Hector.

45:19.282 --> 45:23.286
-But where are we going?
-To the count,
for the election.

45:23.369 --> 45:25.872
Katrina and Kilwillie.

45:25.955 --> 45:29.709
Oh, yes, the election, yeah.
I forgot to vote for
the blighter, you know.

45:29.792 --> 45:34.881
I've a feeling about today,
Hector. We're standing on
the threshold of history.

45:34.964 --> 45:38.050
Centuries of
oppression are about to end.

45:38.134 --> 45:40.928
You're not suggesting
you voted for
that girl, are you?

45:41.012 --> 45:45.600
Hector,
dear, there are days in life
in which one is the fly,

45:45.683 --> 45:51.147
and rare, magical
moments in which one is,
at long last, the windscreen.

45:51.230 --> 45:53.691
-Come on.
-What windscreen?

45:53.775 --> 45:56.277
Has Duncan been
messing about with
that Land Rover again?

46:06.913 --> 46:08.623
Okay?

46:08.706 --> 46:13.169
I'm never mixing red
wine and tequila again.

46:13.252 --> 46:15.671
Listen, about last night...

46:18.382 --> 46:20.009
thanks very much.

46:20.093 --> 46:23.179
-My pleasure.
-No, it wasn't.

46:24.931 --> 46:27.934
Anyway, you're a gentleman.

46:29.519 --> 46:31.729
Showing your breeding,
Archie MacDonald.

46:34.440 --> 46:37.735
Still,
it wasn't a bad snog, was it?

46:37.819 --> 46:40.279
No, Lexie,
it was a damn fine snog.

46:46.828 --> 46:51.582
Maybe we'll get another chance
when I'm not half pished.

46:52.959 --> 46:54.710
Come on, let's go home.

46:58.840 --> 47:00.967
I feel like we're
in that old movie.

47:01.050 --> 47:04.846
What was it? Short Encounter.

47:17.817 --> 47:21.028
MAN: Have you any idea
when we might expect a result?

47:29.871 --> 47:33.040
Can you take us
to the community
centre first, please?

47:36.753 --> 47:38.421
You don't mind, do you?

47:38.504 --> 47:43.885
Dougal Henderson, 214.

47:48.765 --> 47:51.851
Angus Archibald Kilwillie,

47:52.602 --> 47:55.646
782.

48:02.403 --> 48:04.781
Katrina Finlay,

48:05.698 --> 48:07.950
1,000

48:12.497 --> 48:14.791
and 23.

48:15.708 --> 48:18.461
What is the world coming to?

48:20.922 --> 48:24.175
I hereby declare
that Katrina Finlay

48:24.258 --> 48:28.346
has been duly elected to serve
as a member of
the Highland Council

48:28.429 --> 48:30.640
-for the Glenbogle ward.
-What happened?

48:37.563 --> 48:41.067
My dear. You've done so well.

48:42.735 --> 48:45.655
Well done.

48:45.738 --> 48:49.450
See, I told you I
could do it without
the help of the MacDonalds.

48:49.534 --> 48:51.285
Well, the men anyway.

48:51.369 --> 48:54.247
-What do you mean?
I voted for you.
-Did you?

48:54.330 --> 48:57.291
I didn't know that.
Why didn't you tell me?

48:58.543 --> 49:01.295
Katrina, I'm sure
you'll do a good job.

49:01.379 --> 49:03.089
How did it go with Justine?

49:07.927 --> 49:09.262
Your speech.

49:32.535 --> 49:35.872
First of all,
I'd like to thank
the Returning Officer...
