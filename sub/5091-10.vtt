32:29.881 --> 32:32.975
Just don't ever make me feel
this small again.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.314
[DANNY SlGHS]

32:41.326 --> 32:43.590
Her granddaughter was mugged
in the stairwell,

32:43.761 --> 32:46.662
but when the officers from the 15th
took her complaint,

32:46.831 --> 32:49.129
they classified the attack
as harassment.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.259
I bet it felt like more than harassment
to Mrs. Griffin's granddaughter.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.598
So three weeks later,

32:54.772 --> 32:56.603
a friend in the neighborhood
is burglarized.

32:56.774 --> 32:59.766
This time they classify the burglary
as trespassing.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.509
Jimmy is cooking the books.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.237
Yeah. But why?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.806
He turns a felony
into a misdemeanor,

33:05.984 --> 33:07.576
it looks like violent crime
is dropping.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.947
As stats go down,
his stock goes up.

33:12.290 --> 33:15.020
I'm sorry, Dad.
I heard you when I came in.

33:15.226 --> 33:17.126
You already gave Burke
the promotion.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.429
I wasn't talking to Burke.

33:19.597 --> 33:22.031
I gave Gibson
the Manhattan South Command.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.526
You already passed over Burke.
Why?

33:25.937 --> 33:27.928
Trust your gut.

33:31.609 --> 33:33.543
It's a funny thing about decisions.

33:33.745 --> 33:37.841
You don't seem to need to have
to talk yourself into the right ones.

33:39.951 --> 33:41.680
Good for you, Dad.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.519
Yeah.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.486
Only now, I've gotta say goodbye
to an old friend.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.321
[SlGHS]

33:53.698 --> 33:56.189
DANNY:
Hey. Think fast.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.230
Ooh. I could have told you
that wouldn't work.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.530
Yeah, so why didn't you?

34:00.705 --> 34:01.831
Because you had it coming.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.975
And I also knew
that the store didn't take returns.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.703
- That looks good on you. You keep it.
- Oh, really?

34:08.179 --> 34:10.340
TARU finally uploaded
the video enhancement

34:10.514 --> 34:13.541
- on your surveillance video.
- Beautiful, thank you.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.275
Look, we've got a wider picture.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.580
And look at that, there's Sabrina.

34:21.391 --> 34:24.088
Wow. Look who was telling the truth.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.523
Let's watch it again.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.592
See that?

34:28.800 --> 34:32.099
Yeah, it was a flash.
What's that? Reflection of the shot?

34:32.303 --> 34:33.565
Maybe.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.532
That's not a reflection. It's a spark.

34:35.706 --> 34:38.072
- A bullet hit a streetlamp.
- A ricochet.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.534
Exactly.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.577
So that means
that King wasn't the target.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.806
Then who was?

34:45.817 --> 34:47.375
The only other person
who was there.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.016
Sabrina.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.694
DANNY:
Listen, the bullet that killed King

35:05.870 --> 35:08.202
ricocheted off of a street light
outside the club.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.772
JACKlE:
He wasn't the intended target.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.604
- All right, well, then who?
- You.

35:17.148 --> 35:20.083
That's ridiculous. Who in the world
would wanna kill me?

35:20.251 --> 35:22.651
Something tells me
the list might be longer than you think.

35:22.854 --> 35:26.085
Listen, we need the names of anybody
you're romantically involved with.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.924
Uh, yeah, you and my mother.

35:28.092 --> 35:30.993
Whoever tried to kill you is out there.
Give him a chance, be my guest.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.255
And you think the list is so long
I need a pad.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.899
Sabrina, we're running
out of time here, okay?

35:36.067 --> 35:38.297
I don't think I like the way
you say my name anymore.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.493
Fine. Then who?

35:45.676 --> 35:47.405
There was only one.

35:47.578 --> 35:49.671
Let's get this person on the phone,
give him a call.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.280
- Can't.
- Why not?

35:53.784 --> 35:55.775
Because he was shot
the other night.

35:57.788 --> 35:59.813
Of course. King?

36:01.492 --> 36:03.687
Oh, my God.

36:03.895 --> 36:04.919
Did Benita know?

36:05.763 --> 36:06.991
I certainly didn't tell her.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.928
She's two months pregnant,
you know that?

36:09.100 --> 36:10.260
Do you even care about that?

36:10.434 --> 36:12.026
- Probably not.
- Easy, Jack.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.761
Yeah, I'm gonna wait outside.

36:18.409 --> 36:20.775
That was your wife
I saw the other day, wasn't it?

36:21.512 --> 36:22.979
Yeah, why?

36:23.147 --> 36:25.342
Let me ask you something.

36:26.150 --> 36:27.913
What does she got
that I don't have?

36:33.824 --> 36:34.848
Me.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.371
I'm sure you know by now.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.450
The N.Y.P.D. has got more gossips
than a beauty parlor.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.153
Gibson is the right man for the job
and he deserves it.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.753
Well, I appreciate
you giving it to me straight.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.364
You've been cooking the books,
Jimmy.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.234
Now,

37:29.213 --> 37:33.013
you give it to me straight.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.746
Frank...

37:45.396 --> 37:47.864
I've given 40 years of my life
to this job.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.795
You know what I got to show for it?

37:50.001 --> 37:52.060
Three bullet holes,
two destroyed marriages,

37:52.236 --> 37:55.433
- and not a decent sleep in a decade.
- I'm not some tomato in the bar

37:55.606 --> 37:58.234
getting weak in the knees
from your war stories, Jimmy.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.437
For what it's worth,

38:00.611 --> 38:02.272
it's only the past six months.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.973
I was gonna get my bump
and then pull the plug.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.618
You meant well,
otherwise you wouldn't have done it.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.016
I've heard it, Jimmy.

38:11.889 --> 38:15.086
My whole life as a cop, I've heard it.

38:15.259 --> 38:17.227
Come on, Frank.

38:17.928 --> 38:23.662
I'm carrying two alimonies
and four college tuitions.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.095
Going at it two star
was my only shot

38:26.270 --> 38:28.329
at not spending my golden years
hanging Sheetrock.

38:28.539 --> 38:31.770
If you no longer had the commitment,
you should have put in your papers.

38:33.844 --> 38:36.472
All we got out there is our word,
Jimmy.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.275
We lose that, we got nothing.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.276
We lose that,

38:43.254 --> 38:45.119
we are nothing.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.322
Frank...

38:54.365 --> 38:55.798
...everything we've been through.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.640
Are you gonna bust me down?

39:03.808 --> 39:05.673
To captain.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.443
And I'm reassigning you to the 1-2-5.

39:09.714 --> 39:11.682
Staten lsland.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.008
Or you can pull the plug right now

39:15.186 --> 39:18.849
and leave with your pension
and your dignity intact.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.497
Thanks, Frank.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.666
Everything we've been through.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.712
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got some police work to do.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.821
JACKlE:
Heading back to North Carolina?

40:05.870 --> 40:08.236
Another five minutes
and I'm done here.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.374
You'd be willing to take a little walk?

40:10.541 --> 40:11.838
I'm afraid that's not possible.

40:12.009 --> 40:13.909
When did you learn
they were sleeping together.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.503
That night.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.681
I went on the computer
to send him our first sonogram

40:18.849 --> 40:20.612
and he left his e-mail page open.

40:20.785 --> 40:23.948
- Where did you get the gun?
- He gave it to me a year ago.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.588
To keep me safe.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.950
Ironic, huh?

40:27.558 --> 40:29.025
Yeah.

40:42.072 --> 40:43.539
Just keep walking.

40:43.707 --> 40:45.299
JAMlE:
Officer Gonsalvez.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.706
You were on the warrant squad
with my brother that night.

40:47.878 --> 40:50.244
I said walk.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.550
You said to meet
on the next corner.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.152
I lied.
Better tell your brother Danny

40:57.321 --> 40:59.255
you need a refresher
on picking up tails.

40:59.423 --> 41:00.754
Been on you for three blocks.

41:00.925 --> 41:02.324
- Where are we going?
- Just move.

41:04.762 --> 41:06.923
How did you find me?
Who are you working for?

41:07.097 --> 41:09.463
And what do you want?
Even think about lying

41:09.633 --> 41:10.827
and I'm a faint memory.

41:11.001 --> 41:13.265
I got your number
from the Pension Section.

41:13.437 --> 41:15.268
Follow the money, not bad, rook.

41:15.573 --> 41:18.406
Not working for anyone. I wanna know
what happened to my brother Joe.

41:18.576 --> 41:19.770
Read the official report.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.104
I did, it's a snow job.

41:21.745 --> 41:24.646
Okay, so maybe you've got
a little Reagan blood in you after all.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.773
Why did you leave the department?

41:26.951 --> 41:28.111
I loved being on the job,

41:28.285 --> 41:31.448
but my daughter needs a mother,
not a dead cop.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.715
Did somebody threaten you?

41:34.758 --> 41:36.658
Was it Blue Templar?
Is that who killed Joe?

41:59.950 --> 42:01.178
So how are we doing?

42:03.320 --> 42:05.015
You tell me.

42:07.324 --> 42:10.191
I never stepped out of bounds,
Linda.

42:10.461 --> 42:11.485
I ain't that guy.

42:12.997 --> 42:14.362
I know.

42:14.665 --> 42:15.791
Do you?

42:16.133 --> 42:17.828
Of course.

42:18.002 --> 42:21.199
Just-- I know Danny Reagan
from when we first met.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.170
Running around the city
all hours of the night.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.037
- More girlfriends than I had shoes.
- Yeah.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.645
But when we got our thing going,
I never looked back, did l?

42:29.813 --> 42:31.246
No.

42:31.415 --> 42:33.679
But sometimes I wonder.

42:33.851 --> 42:34.875
Maybe you miss it.

42:36.287 --> 42:38.380
I mean, it sure is more exciting

42:38.556 --> 42:41.150
than sleepy Staten lsland
with me and the boys.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.349
Says who?

42:42.660 --> 42:44.389
You mean that?

42:45.162 --> 42:46.720
Yeah, I do.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.841
- I love you.
- I love you.
