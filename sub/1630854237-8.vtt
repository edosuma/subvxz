00:56.401 --> 00:57.919
- We got him.
- We got him.

01:00.405 --> 01:02.476
Oh, you should've seen
your face, dude.

01:02.476 --> 01:04.892
You were,
"Ohh, snakes in my face, man!"

01:04.892 --> 01:06.100
Welcome back, bro.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.112
Diane.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.631
Maya?

01:21.702 --> 01:22.979
Did you forget
I was coming?

01:22.979 --> 01:24.325
I didn't forget.

01:24.325 --> 01:26.810
I just--
I didn't realize it was now.

01:26.810 --> 01:28.088
I didn't-- I didn't--
I didn't realize the time.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.813
I haven't been
sleeping much,

01:29.813 --> 01:31.953
and I decided to do
a deep clean around 4:00 a.m.,

01:31.953 --> 01:33.507
and I lost
track of time.

01:33.507 --> 01:34.922
Oh.

01:34.922 --> 01:36.958
Is your wife home?

01:36.958 --> 01:39.168
She doesn't live here anymore.
I don't know where she lives.

01:39.168 --> 01:40.928
I haven't heard from her
since the day

01:40.928 --> 01:43.482
she had me committed
to a loony bin.

01:43.482 --> 01:46.140
The term "loony bin"
is a throwback to a time

01:46.140 --> 01:47.693
when culturally,
we made fun of people

01:47.693 --> 01:49.523
with mental health crises.

01:49.523 --> 01:51.801
I think it's beneath you,
and I know it's beneath me.

01:51.801 --> 01:53.665
Okay.

01:53.665 --> 01:54.976
Maya, I carved out
the whole day today,

01:54.976 --> 01:57.772
which wasn't easy,
so I'm hoping I can come in.

01:57.772 --> 01:59.671
Yeah, uh, of course.
Come on in.

01:59.671 --> 02:01.604
I hope you don't mind the smell
of cleaning products.

02:01.604 --> 02:03.433
Uh,
can we open a window?

02:03.433 --> 02:06.298
Yeah, that's-- that's a--
that's probably a good idea.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.844
Morning, Captain.

02:34.844 --> 02:36.466
Gibson, I'm sure you want your
old position back,

02:36.466 --> 02:39.020
but lucky me,
I got so many lieutenants.

02:39.020 --> 02:40.988
It's fine. I'm happy to help out
while Bishop's on leave.

02:40.988 --> 02:43.749
Mm-hmm.

02:43.749 --> 02:45.061
Sullivan,
I'm assigning Gibson to you

02:45.061 --> 02:47.477
until he's adjusted
to the job.

02:47.477 --> 02:49.099
Oh, sir, that's not--
that's not necessary.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.241
I forgot how much
I like that guy.

02:52.241 --> 02:55.071
Yeah. Gibson, engine needs
a hose change.

02:55.071 --> 02:57.556
Look, you've been off the job
for more than six months.

02:57.556 --> 02:59.351
That makes you the grunt.

02:59.351 --> 03:00.732
Make some more coffee, too.

03:00.732 --> 03:02.665
Great.
Sprinkles.

03:02.665 --> 03:04.114
Got it.

03:04.114 --> 03:05.909
Coffee.

03:05.909 --> 03:07.394
Hose change.

03:08.774 --> 03:12.882
Chief Ross, ladies,
I, more than anyone,

03:12.882 --> 03:14.849
am appalled by what happened
the other night.

03:14.849 --> 03:16.403
Well, what part?

03:16.403 --> 03:17.714
The profiling of a young,
innocent Black man,

03:17.714 --> 03:19.337
or the weapons being drawn

03:19.337 --> 03:21.028
because he had butter
in his backpack?

03:21.028 --> 03:22.754
All of it.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.238
Truthfully, it makes both
of our departments look bad.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.689
You see the narrative
the press is taking--

03:26.689 --> 03:29.554
"Firefighters versus police
in a pissing contest."

03:29.554 --> 03:31.141
Yeah, I saw that editorial
calling for the feds

03:31.141 --> 03:32.695
to investigate Seattle PD

03:32.695 --> 03:35.456
for possible
civil rights violations,

03:35.456 --> 03:37.734
but my department
wasn't mentioned.

03:37.734 --> 03:40.220
If we let that
narrative prevail,

03:40.220 --> 03:43.084
then the people lose all trust
in our city's public servants,

03:43.084 --> 03:44.258
firefighters included.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.639
We can't let that happen.

03:45.639 --> 03:47.779
I sense a proposition
coming on.

03:47.779 --> 03:50.782
Stand with me
- at tonight's press conference.
- Mm-hmm.

03:50.782 --> 03:53.543
Let's show the people
that fire and police are united,

03:53.543 --> 03:55.269
that we're working together
to prevent

03:55.269 --> 03:57.754
any other unfortunate accidents
like the other night's.

03:57.754 --> 03:59.894
Accidents?
If it weren't for the Chief... Hughes.

03:59.894 --> 04:01.620
...your officers would have
- tased Jamal, or worse.
- Hughes.

04:04.658 --> 04:07.488
Look,
my people got it wrong,

04:07.488 --> 04:09.318
just like your people
got it wrong

04:09.318 --> 04:11.975
when they leaked my wife's
and my private information

04:11.975 --> 04:14.254
from that Crisis One call.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.498
Kitty's talking about lawsuits
and lawyers and PR firms--

04:17.498 --> 04:19.431
no feds, though--

04:19.431 --> 04:23.159
but a lawsuit
can get ugly quickly,

04:23.159 --> 04:27.957
just like this Jamal incident
can get ugly if we let it.

04:27.957 --> 04:31.443
But, fortunately, Jamal got home
safely to his family.

04:31.443 --> 04:34.308
Because fire and police
worked together.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.965
That's all I'm saying.

04:35.965 --> 04:38.001
Oh.

04:38.001 --> 04:40.003
Will you stand with me?

04:45.181 --> 04:46.596
I'll be there.

04:52.499 --> 04:54.880
Herrera. Hughes.

04:57.504 --> 04:59.713
Chief,
with all due respect,

04:59.713 --> 05:01.818
I think he's bluffing
on the lawsuits.

05:01.818 --> 05:03.475
I appreciate you both
being here. Thank you.

05:05.719 --> 05:07.237
Thank you.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.033
Thank you, Chief.

05:18.007 --> 05:20.216
All right.

05:20.216 --> 05:22.494
What's all this?

05:22.494 --> 05:24.254
Today, I'm on
incident reports.

05:26.222 --> 05:27.706
And what's all that?

05:27.706 --> 05:29.881
Let's just say the meeting
took a turn.

05:29.881 --> 05:32.642
Took a turn?
That meeting went off a cliff.

05:32.642 --> 05:34.057
Dixon used the Crisis One leak
as leverage

05:34.057 --> 05:35.714
to get Ross to make nice.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.682
She's gonna stand with Dixon
and give PD the credit

05:37.682 --> 05:39.373
for the de-escalation
instead of Crisis One.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.926
It's gross.

05:40.926 --> 05:42.514
That's one more reason
why we shouldn't leak

05:42.514 --> 05:45.241
private information
- from the calls we go on.
- Mm-hmm.

05:45.241 --> 05:46.898
How many more times are you
gonna shame me about that?

05:46.898 --> 05:50.695
As many as it takes
for the shame to really sink in.

05:50.695 --> 05:52.766
I mean, seriously, Travis,
it's like you don't even care.

05:52.766 --> 05:55.665
I do care.
I care a lot, which is why

05:55.665 --> 05:57.702
Eli is coming here to work
on the campaign...
Oh, Eli.

05:57.702 --> 05:59.945
...so the leak,
which was definitely misguided

05:59.945 --> 06:01.602
and for which
I feel great shame... No.

06:01.602 --> 06:02.776
...shall not be
for nothing.

06:04.571 --> 06:05.917
Why are you smiling?

06:05.917 --> 06:07.367
I missed this.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.920
What, you missed
everybody fighting?

06:08.920 --> 06:10.715
I guess so.

06:10.715 --> 06:12.889
And I missed that.

06:12.889 --> 06:15.409
<i>Aid 19, Ladder 19,
Engine 19...</i> All right. Have fun.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.274
<i>...requested
to 1503 Aldred Road.</i>

06:24.107 --> 06:26.040
Aldred Road.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.249
This is part of last year's
redistricting, isn't it?

06:28.249 --> 06:30.735
Yeah.

06:30.735 --> 06:34.117
Man, it's been a long time
since I've been back here.

06:35.981 --> 06:38.536
Wait, is this
your old neighborhood?

06:38.536 --> 06:40.745
Hey, can we go get the, um--
the guava popsicles

06:40.745 --> 06:42.402
from the corner store
you told me about?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.989
You know, I'd love
to get one of those,

06:43.989 --> 06:47.165
but those are actually
in my other old neighborhood.

06:47.165 --> 06:48.994
- Your other old neighborhood?
- Yeah.

06:48.994 --> 06:52.929
My mom and I, we moved there
when I was 14 after my dad died.

06:52.929 --> 06:56.312
This is where we lived when--
when he was alive.

06:56.312 --> 06:58.763
And we just passed a condo
that used to be the corner store

06:58.763 --> 07:01.179
I went to with my mom
back in the day.

07:04.009 --> 07:05.666
It's all so different
from what I remember.

07:08.635 --> 07:09.946
I think you've made
plenty of room.

07:09.946 --> 07:11.431
No,
this place is a mess.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.191
I'm not sure I can think
in a place this messy.

07:13.191 --> 07:14.434
That's perfect.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.642
You're not gonna do much
thinking today.

07:15.642 --> 07:16.953
Is that a joke?

07:16.953 --> 07:18.472
Nope.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.750
Well, I have a hard time--Sitting?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.338
Resting.
Perfect.

07:22.338 --> 07:24.202
You're definitely not going
to be resting today.

07:24.202 --> 07:26.204
We're not resting or thinking?
What are we doing?

07:26.204 --> 07:27.999
Drawing.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.690
I would definitely prefer
to think or rest.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.934
Hm. It's nice to see
your sense of humor

07:31.934 --> 07:33.798
is still in there somewhere.

07:33.798 --> 07:35.662
In there somewhere?
What's that supposed to mean?

07:35.662 --> 07:38.009
Maya, your wife
had to 5150 you

07:38.009 --> 07:39.769
to get you the medical care
you needed,

07:39.769 --> 07:41.391
and your employers
are waiting for me

07:41.391 --> 07:43.773
to determine if it's safe
to let you go back to work.

07:43.773 --> 07:45.465
You can keep
moving furniture,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.018
or you can keep challenging
every word I say,

07:47.018 --> 07:48.985
you could keep your guard up
all day if you want to,

07:48.985 --> 07:52.230
but it's not gonna get you
back to work any faster.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.991
Do you still hope to get back
to work for the fire department?

08:13.216 --> 08:16.496
Ladder 19 fire attack,
get some ventilation flowing.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.532
Engine 19, search and rescue.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.672
Set up triage just in case.

08:20.672 --> 08:23.537
Hey, bro!
Theo Ruiz!

08:23.537 --> 08:26.160
Hey! What's up?
It's me, Tomás.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.335
Don't be acting like you
don't know me, Teodora.

08:28.335 --> 08:31.027
Hey, Tomás.
I got a job to do here, man.

08:31.027 --> 08:33.720
That's my boy right there.
Look at him, just like his pops.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.170
Hey, come by the barbershop
sometime, bro.

08:36.170 --> 08:37.724
I'll hook you up
with the family discount!

08:37.724 --> 08:39.208
Yeah, I'll catch up
with you later.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.451
All right.

08:46.836 --> 08:48.700
No.
Hello to you, too.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.358
Travis isn't here.

08:51.358 --> 08:54.050
And I didn't have time for you
before you proved yourself

08:54.050 --> 08:55.914
a total pariah monster.

08:55.914 --> 08:57.847
I really don't have
the time for you now.

08:57.847 --> 08:59.435
And, uh, what, pray tell,
have I done that solidified

08:59.435 --> 09:02.093
my "pariah monster" status
in your estimation?

09:02.093 --> 09:03.957
The Dixon leak.
That was your fault.

09:03.957 --> 09:05.406
And now
that stupid blond slug

09:05.406 --> 09:06.925
is using it
as leverage against Ross.

09:06.925 --> 09:08.582
Travis has risen in
the polls--
No more talking.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.756
Also, get out.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.723
Andy, don't be shortsighted.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.483
You have to see
the bigger picture.

09:13.483 --> 09:14.968
Close your eyes.

09:17.729 --> 09:19.248
Okay, keep them open.

09:19.248 --> 09:21.146
But picture a world
where Dixon isn't mayor,

09:21.146 --> 09:22.458
Crisis One is safe,

09:22.458 --> 09:24.805
and Travis' soul
is still intact.

09:24.805 --> 09:28.084
Your team
is united and strong.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.052
No, yeah,
I-- I-I see it.

09:30.052 --> 09:32.710
I-I-- I think I--
I'm seeing the bigger picture.

09:32.710 --> 09:34.504
Wow. Wait, I think
I see something else.

09:34.504 --> 09:36.058
Oh, yeah?
What do you see?

09:36.058 --> 09:38.957
Your ass on a curb, never
to be seen or heard from again.

09:38.957 --> 09:41.650
I think I rather like that
my ass is in your picture.

09:41.650 --> 09:44.618
Oh, my God.

09:48.518 --> 09:50.624
All right, Ruiz,
you go straight ahead.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.419
Hughes,
you're with me. Copy.

09:52.419 --> 09:54.076
Let's be quick.

09:56.803 --> 09:59.081
Hughes,
to the right.

09:59.081 --> 10:01.290
Anybody in here?

10:01.290 --> 10:04.673
Hello? Hello?

10:04.673 --> 10:06.433
Hello?
Anybody in here?

10:12.094 --> 10:14.648
The fire is off the kitchen,
but no civilians.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.132
Copy.
Continue search and rescue.

10:17.444 --> 10:18.859
There's nothing upstairs.

10:21.517 --> 10:23.553
Mari, get under her.
Grab her legs!

10:23.553 --> 10:27.143
Help us, please!
You have to help us!

10:28.973 --> 10:31.113
Okay,
what am I drawing?

10:31.113 --> 10:32.321
A timeline.

10:32.321 --> 10:34.116
Of what?

10:34.116 --> 10:35.876
Uh, well,
you're an Olympian.

10:35.876 --> 10:39.984
Not only that, you won the gold
on a sprained ankle.

10:39.984 --> 10:41.468
Yep.

10:41.468 --> 10:43.194
What happened
to your ankle?

10:43.194 --> 10:48.164
I twisted it at Halloween,
and it hasn't quite healed yet.

10:48.164 --> 10:50.028
And at the Olympics?

10:50.028 --> 10:52.686
I twisted it at
the Olympic Village

10:52.686 --> 10:55.068
two nights
before my big race.

10:55.068 --> 10:58.519
I was chasing after a girl
from the French relay team.

10:58.519 --> 11:00.798
I was tipsy.
It was stupid.

11:00.798 --> 11:02.696
I was stupid.
But I wasn't gonna let

11:02.696 --> 11:05.699
one stupid night
decide my fate,

11:05.699 --> 11:08.426
so I ran anyway,
and I won anyway.

11:08.426 --> 11:11.705
Got it. Okay.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.880
Make a timeline
of your Olympic win.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.744
Every relevant moment
leading up to it.

11:15.744 --> 11:17.262
That's impossible.

11:17.262 --> 11:18.712
How am I supposed to remember
every moment?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.852
The ones that matter
will come to you.

11:20.852 --> 11:24.062
Start with the first time
you ever had the thought,

11:24.062 --> 11:25.823
"I want to win."

11:50.192 --> 11:52.056
What do we got?

11:52.056 --> 11:54.783
She was already having trouble
breathing and needs assistance.

11:54.783 --> 11:56.094
It's all right.
Come on, come on.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.409
She's gonna be all right, right?

12:00.409 --> 12:02.169
We got her,
we got her.

12:07.174 --> 12:09.142
Ma'am, save your breath.

12:09.142 --> 12:10.868
Smoke inhalation
can creep up on you.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.468
We shouldn't have stayed.

12:25.468 --> 12:26.676
I told you we shouldn't
have stayed.

12:26.676 --> 12:28.402
It's our home!
Why wouldn't we stay?

12:28.402 --> 12:30.059
They're gonna foreclose
on our home.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.510
Sit down, sit down.
Let me check your oxygen levels.

12:32.510 --> 12:35.755
All that hard
work for nothing.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.826
We're gonna lose our house
after all.

12:37.826 --> 12:39.517
No!

12:39.517 --> 12:42.347
You'll save it, right?

12:42.347 --> 12:44.073
You know,
we're Seattle's finest.

12:44.073 --> 12:46.938
We got you.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.847
Filing, doing the dishes--

12:58.847 --> 12:59.951
when you're not out there
being a superhero,

12:59.951 --> 13:01.470
you're ostensibly
a 1960s secretary, huh?

13:03.023 --> 13:04.335
Something
I've always wanted.

13:04.335 --> 13:07.648
The deal was you be quiet,
I let you stay.

13:07.648 --> 13:09.616
Why do you hate me?

13:09.616 --> 13:11.169
Your disproportionate love
for yourself

13:11.169 --> 13:12.792
has to be balanced out somehow.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.379
- I'm just doing my part.
- I'm not a bad guy.

13:14.379 --> 13:15.967
- I never said you were.
- But you treat me like one.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.210
And, you know, that's fine,
I can take it,

13:17.210 --> 13:18.728
but you're
influencing Travis.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.800
Travis is an adult,
all right?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.353
He can make up his own mind
about people.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.388
Yeah, yeah, he did.
He picked me.

13:23.388 --> 13:26.046
He chose to work
with me.

13:26.046 --> 13:29.463
You don't like my methodology,
but it's not my methodology.

13:29.463 --> 13:31.362
It's how you win
an election.

13:31.362 --> 13:32.570
I get Travis across
the finish line

13:32.570 --> 13:34.365
or it's Michael Dixon, yeah?

13:34.365 --> 13:37.368
The man that will wreak havoc
on this city and Crisis One,

13:37.368 --> 13:39.473
not to mention
any number of petty paybacks

13:39.473 --> 13:40.820
that cretin will throw
at this station.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.476
I-- Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

13:42.476 --> 13:43.892
I want you to get out
of Travis' ear about me

13:43.892 --> 13:46.135
and into everyone else's
<i>for</i> me.

13:46.135 --> 13:47.861
You're the true leader
of this station.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.483
Okay, now you're just trying
to butter me up.

13:49.483 --> 13:50.899
Only if you find
the truth flattering.

13:50.899 --> 13:52.245
You have a tremendous amount
of influence

13:52.245 --> 13:54.178
with these people
and you know it.

13:54.178 --> 13:55.869
Look,
I don't work for you.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.388
You wouldn't be doing it for me,
you'd be doing it for Travis,

13:57.388 --> 13:58.976
you'd be doing it
for the city of Seattle.

13:58.976 --> 14:00.253
You'd be doing it for the good
of freaking humanity.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.875
And you took it
too far.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.359
Too far. Okay. Yeah.

14:05.258 --> 14:07.087
Okay, that's good.

14:07.087 --> 14:09.262
But I only got
to age 12.

14:09.262 --> 14:10.263
We have enough.

14:10.263 --> 14:11.333
Enough for what?

14:11.333 --> 14:13.266
What does this say?

14:13.266 --> 14:14.405
You can't read it?

14:14.405 --> 14:18.098
I can read it, but...

14:18.098 --> 14:19.513
I'd like
you to read it.

14:19.513 --> 14:21.343
That feels a little patronizing
to me.

14:21.343 --> 14:24.070
You feel a little exhausting
to me, so we're even.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.519
Fair enough.

14:25.519 --> 14:29.247
It says, "3 years old,
my cousin's track meet."

14:29.247 --> 14:32.423
That's the first thought
you had of winning?

14:32.423 --> 14:34.287
The first one
I can remember.

14:34.287 --> 14:35.529
Because your cousin won.

14:35.529 --> 14:37.738
No, because she lost.

14:37.738 --> 14:42.260
She was winning
and then... she lost.

14:42.260 --> 14:44.124
And I-I saw his face.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.712
Who's he?
My dad.

14:45.712 --> 14:50.475
I-I saw... his face
when she lost.

14:50.475 --> 14:51.821
You know, my ankle hurts.
I'm gonna get some ice.

14:51.821 --> 14:53.893
Wait.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.931
Before you get that ice,
can you move toward that pain?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.899
I don't know what that means,
but my ankle hurts.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.555
Okay,
just let it hurt.

15:01.555 --> 15:03.937
I need ice!

15:03.937 --> 15:07.768
You ran a race on
a sprained ankle and won gold.

15:07.768 --> 15:09.943
You can sit with pain, Maya.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.947
Just touch your ankle.

15:15.673 --> 15:18.745
Just put your hand
on it.

15:34.588 --> 15:37.350
I don't--
I don't--

15:37.350 --> 15:38.765
I don't know why.

15:38.765 --> 15:40.629
It's okay.

15:40.629 --> 15:41.975
It's okay not to know.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.770
I don't want to lose.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.082
I don't want to lose!

15:45.082 --> 15:46.704
I don't want to lose.

15:46.704 --> 15:48.119
It's okay, Maya.
Let it out.

15:48.119 --> 15:50.087
I just--
I don't want to lose.

15:50.087 --> 15:51.778
I don't want to lose.

15:51.778 --> 15:53.504
It's okay.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.372
I don't want
to lose. I don't want...

16:01.443 --> 16:04.998
I don't want to lose.

16:07.483 --> 16:10.314
I don't want to lose.

16:10.314 --> 16:14.042
I don't--
I don't want to lose.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.046
Mm-hmm.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.672
Mari, you're okay
and you're safe, all right?

16:23.672 --> 16:25.501
We're gonna take care of you
and your family.

16:25.501 --> 16:26.986
It's gonna take
a lot more than you think

16:26.986 --> 16:28.711
to fix
this family up now.

16:28.711 --> 16:31.197
Can I get a hand
with these hoses over here?

16:31.197 --> 16:33.199
Don't worry, <i>mija.
Mija,</i> we're gonna get back

16:33.199 --> 16:34.821
on our feet.

16:34.821 --> 16:36.305
We don't even have a home
to reclaim.

16:36.305 --> 16:37.272
We've lost everything.

16:41.897 --> 16:45.694
You have to save our house. Please.

16:45.694 --> 16:47.420
Oh, no.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.663
No. Our family bible.

16:49.663 --> 16:51.044
It's got our family tree,
birth records,

16:51.044 --> 16:52.459
citizenship papers--Okay, okay.

16:54.703 --> 16:55.945
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

17:00.398 --> 17:01.606
Okay. No, no, no, no.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.060
Captain, what's the status
on the fire?

17:07.060 --> 17:09.545
Contained to two rooms
at the rear of the first floor.

17:09.545 --> 17:11.237
Our civilians need
their family bible.

17:11.237 --> 17:12.721
I can run back in and get it.
It'll only take a minute.

17:12.721 --> 17:13.894
We wait till the fire's
completely out to retrieve

17:13.894 --> 17:15.517
any personal items.

17:15.517 --> 17:16.863
You just said
the fire's contained.

17:16.863 --> 17:18.278
I-I've seen my dad walk
a whole family--

17:18.278 --> 17:20.729
Ruiz, get back
to your station now.

17:23.111 --> 17:25.078
Hey! Hey.
Where's Mari?

17:25.078 --> 17:26.045
She was following you.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.632
Mom!

17:29.772 --> 17:30.946
Damn it! Mari!

17:30.946 --> 17:32.948
Ruiz, get back here!

17:32.948 --> 17:35.123
Hey, Captain, you have
a civilian that just
went back inside.

17:35.123 --> 17:37.953
Then go in
and get them, Montgomery.

17:37.953 --> 17:40.473
19, we still need
those back rooms overhauled.

17:40.473 --> 17:43.131
Get two blowers in the front
door and clear out that smoke.

17:45.650 --> 17:47.790
Mari!
Oh, my God!

17:49.965 --> 17:51.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.107
No, no, no, Hughes,
wait, wait, wait!

17:54.107 --> 17:55.971
Hughes, Hughes,
- Hughes, Hughes.
- You have to let me go!
You have to let me go!

17:55.971 --> 17:58.111
Vic, we have--
Vic, we have to wait!

17:58.111 --> 18:00.941
- I know, I know.
- Ruiz,
Montgomery, report.

18:05.014 --> 18:08.121
Montgomery, Ruiz,
what's your status?

18:10.813 --> 18:12.436
Stand by for
Rapid Intervention.

18:12.436 --> 18:15.956
We may need saws and axes
to extricate our team.

18:15.956 --> 18:18.649
Montgomery, Ruiz, report!

18:23.861 --> 18:26.139
<i>Copy, Captain.
We're in the basement.</i>

18:26.139 --> 18:28.831
Are you injured?

18:31.662 --> 18:32.973
You good?

18:32.973 --> 18:33.974
That really sucked.

18:33.974 --> 18:35.355
Mari, are you hurt?

18:35.355 --> 18:37.150
No, somehow.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.807
Captain,
we're all okay.

18:38.807 --> 18:40.705
But we don't know where
that explosion came from.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.638
<i>Do you?</i>
No, no idea.

18:42.638 --> 18:44.364
Make your way out ASAP.

18:44.364 --> 18:46.539
Copy, Captain,
but the stairwell has collapsed,

18:46.539 --> 18:48.057
and there's a fire
in the other direction.

18:48.057 --> 18:49.300
I don't see another way
out of here.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.027
We may be trapped.

18:52.027 --> 18:54.271
Look, I-I-I'm saying,
you're a firefighter,

18:54.271 --> 18:55.824
you don't understand
the intricacies of this.

18:55.824 --> 18:56.997
How are we still having
this conversation?

18:56.997 --> 18:58.551
How are you still here?

18:58.551 --> 18:59.724
You slide down a little pole,
you go out,

18:59.724 --> 19:01.554
you save cats and kids... Okay.

19:01.554 --> 19:03.694
...acting stupid and noble
and the world needs that.

19:03.694 --> 19:05.454
But I win elections
for the good guys

19:05.454 --> 19:06.455
and the world needs that, too.
Ah, okay.

19:06.455 --> 19:07.663
Stupid and noble.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.217
I didn't mean--Yeah, you did.

19:09.217 --> 19:10.735
What will it take for you
to just lay off

19:10.735 --> 19:12.496
and let me do my thing?

19:12.496 --> 19:15.188
Okay.
Slide down that pole.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.845
You're joking.

19:16.845 --> 19:18.812
No. The people who slide down
that pole

19:18.812 --> 19:21.229
are part of the Stupid
and Noble Firefighter Club.

19:21.229 --> 19:23.300
They're the only ones I listen
to about firefighter stuff.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.233
Go ahead. Go on.

19:25.233 --> 19:28.857
This is literally a primary
school catwalk playground thing.

19:28.857 --> 19:30.755
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.
Just, you know, kid stuff.

19:30.755 --> 19:34.069
'Cause we're just big,
dumb kids who fight fires.

19:34.069 --> 19:35.933
Big, dumb kids--

19:35.933 --> 19:37.831
Hey! No! Eli!
No!

19:38.867 --> 19:41.904
Oh, my God! No!

19:41.904 --> 19:43.906
I was kidding,
you idiot.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.598
We need to call for help.

19:45.598 --> 19:48.048
I am literally
who would arrive.

19:48.048 --> 19:51.224
Ugh, you're lucky
it's just a dislocation.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.329
You coulda killed yourself.

19:52.329 --> 19:53.537
You told me to!

19:53.537 --> 19:55.263
Hey, hey, hey.
I was kidding.

19:55.263 --> 19:57.230
Ohhh, my God!

19:57.230 --> 19:59.232
No one, two, three?
Okay.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.234
Are you in pain or not?

20:01.234 --> 20:02.511
Huh.
All right.

20:02.511 --> 20:03.616
Come on,
let's get it immobilized

20:03.616 --> 20:05.065
and put some ice
on it.

20:05.065 --> 20:07.067
I still can't believe
you did that.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.931
You told me to!

20:08.931 --> 20:11.244
Gibson, Warren,
grab the gurney and med gear.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.247
South side of the house
in the driveway.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.422
I shouldn't have done this.

20:16.422 --> 20:18.251
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.425
Okay, Mari--
Please, God,
I'm sorry.

20:19.425 --> 20:21.427
Listen to me.
You're okay.

20:21.427 --> 20:22.704
Take deep breaths in this,
all right?

20:22.704 --> 20:24.292
You're okay. We've got you.
Stay calm.

20:24.292 --> 20:26.742
Take some deep breaths.

20:26.742 --> 20:28.641
Captain, we've got more fires
on the basement level.

20:28.641 --> 20:30.470
Searching for egress.

20:30.470 --> 20:33.266
We put all our savings
into this house.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.648
We raised Lupe here.

20:35.648 --> 20:38.720
We brought in Julio's parents
when his father got sick.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.274
We just-- I just wanted
something to pass down.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.793
I'm so sorry.

20:42.793 --> 20:44.139
Mari, it's okay.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

20:44.139 --> 20:45.658
Try not to breathe in
the smoke.

20:45.658 --> 20:47.660
Keep that pressed
against your face.

20:47.660 --> 20:49.420
Hey, man.
Did you find something?

20:49.420 --> 20:51.836
Not yet, but this house is just
like the one I grew up in.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.838
They were all built
at the same time.

20:53.838 --> 20:55.254
There should be
a window here.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.427
I'm so sorry.

20:56.427 --> 20:59.603
I can't reach.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.504
I can--Stay, stay, stay.

21:04.504 --> 21:06.092
Stay with me right here.

21:12.201 --> 21:14.756
Yeah!

21:14.756 --> 21:16.930
Captain, there's
an egress window

21:16.930 --> 21:18.587
<i>on the north side
of the house.</i>

21:18.587 --> 21:21.003
Copy, Ruiz.
Moving there now.

21:21.003 --> 21:23.178
Captain, we got security bars
on this thing.

21:23.178 --> 21:26.319
Sullivan, Hughes,
grab the rotary saw.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.527
Keep that pressed
against your face.

21:27.527 --> 21:28.873
Take cover.
Turn away.

21:28.873 --> 21:31.151
Stay down.
Down, down.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.298
Here.
Get some air.

21:45.994 --> 21:48.962
Chief Ross, just the person
I was looking for.

21:48.962 --> 21:51.344
Dixon, to what do I owe
the pleasure, again,

21:51.344 --> 21:54.796
today, but only a few hours
after I just saw you?

21:54.796 --> 21:56.487
It was the success
of our morning's adventure

21:56.487 --> 21:57.902
that inspired me
to come.

21:57.902 --> 21:59.663
Matcha latte?

21:59.663 --> 22:02.251
According to my wife,
all the pretty girls love these.

22:02.251 --> 22:04.184
And pretty girls
in a complimentary way,

22:04.184 --> 22:05.703
not a pejorative way.

22:05.703 --> 22:06.980
Michael, I have
a meeting in 10.

22:06.980 --> 22:07.981
Oh, thank you for
calling me Michael.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.466
Can I call you Natasha?

22:09.466 --> 22:11.640
If it'll help you cut
to the chase.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.367
Right. I just wanted to say
how pleased I was

22:14.367 --> 22:17.715
at how deftly
we navigated this morning,

22:17.715 --> 22:19.717
especially while you were
clearly having to negotiate

22:19.717 --> 22:22.513
the naive zeal
of those yappy, impractical,

22:22.513 --> 22:24.101
bleeding heart millennial
at 19.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.999
Path of least resistance,
you know?

22:25.999 --> 22:28.381
Exactly. And in the spirit
of exactly that--

22:28.381 --> 22:30.003
FD Union hasn't decided

22:30.003 --> 22:32.661
who they're going to
endorse for mayor yet.

22:32.661 --> 22:34.836
A word of support from you
for me

22:34.836 --> 22:36.700
would really
seal the deal

22:36.700 --> 22:39.841
and put a nice media topspin
on tonight's public handshake.

22:39.841 --> 22:41.256
Indeed.

22:41.256 --> 22:42.844
I knew
I could count on you.

22:42.844 --> 22:44.224
I am a woman who can always
be counted on

22:44.224 --> 22:45.709
to do the right thing,

22:45.709 --> 22:48.263
even to the man
who nearly had me tased.

22:48.263 --> 22:51.093
You're such a card, Natasha.

22:51.093 --> 22:54.269
I wouldn't buy a $7 hot drink
for just anyone.

22:54.269 --> 22:55.753
Worth it.
You're worth it!

22:55.753 --> 22:57.410
See you tonight. Tonight.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.998
Yeah.

23:01.725 --> 23:03.865
How do you feel?

23:03.865 --> 23:06.108
Ugh. You mean
other than mortified?

23:06.108 --> 23:09.318
Why mortified?

23:09.318 --> 23:13.219
Because I barely know you
and I snotted all over you.

23:14.703 --> 23:18.707
Okay, yeah,
so other than mortified.

23:19.708 --> 23:22.780
Shaky. Raw.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.368
How's your ankle feeling?

23:28.165 --> 23:29.753
It doesn't hurt.

23:29.753 --> 23:31.271
Or barely.

23:31.271 --> 23:33.584
That is so strange.
Why doesn't it hurt?

23:33.584 --> 23:36.553
Well, sometimes physical pain,
when it builds like that--

23:36.553 --> 23:38.071
the pain can be attached

23:38.071 --> 23:40.660
to a part of you
that needs attention.

23:40.660 --> 23:42.317
Part of me?

23:42.317 --> 23:43.939
Well, in this case,
I would venture a guess

23:43.939 --> 23:46.425
that it was the 3-year-old
part of you.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.254
The 3-year-old part of me.

23:48.254 --> 23:49.911
Yes.

23:49.911 --> 23:51.947
I don't get it.

23:51.947 --> 23:55.364
Tell me more about your cousin's
race when you were 3 years old.

23:59.265 --> 24:04.132
Uh, my father

24:04.132 --> 24:05.823
hated her for losing.

24:05.823 --> 24:07.480
Mm.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.484
When she was winning,
he loved her.

24:14.660 --> 24:17.456
He cheered for her.

24:19.423 --> 24:24.980
But when she lost,
he looked...

24:27.949 --> 24:29.398
...so ashamed.

24:31.608 --> 24:33.472
He was so ashamed.

24:35.612 --> 24:38.373
I decided
I would never lose.

24:40.996 --> 24:43.861
You decided
you would never lose

24:43.861 --> 24:46.036
so you could keep
your father's love.

24:46.036 --> 24:49.349
Yes.
So you would be
worthy of his love.

24:49.349 --> 24:51.213
Yes.

24:51.213 --> 24:54.631
When a child is 3 years old,
a parent's love is everything.

24:54.631 --> 24:56.149
Yes.

24:56.149 --> 24:59.428
A parent's love is God
to a 3-year-old.

24:59.428 --> 25:01.189
Yes.

25:01.189 --> 25:04.572
So if you are worthy,
if your father loves you,

25:04.572 --> 25:07.091
you get to stay alive.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.403
Yes.

25:08.403 --> 25:10.232
So all this time,

25:10.232 --> 25:13.028
ever since you were demoted
from captain,

25:13.028 --> 25:16.238
ever since you started "losing,"
the 3-year-old part of you

25:16.238 --> 25:18.240
has been desperate
for your attention,

25:18.240 --> 25:20.864
screaming at you
to stop losing,

25:20.864 --> 25:23.660
trying like hell
to save your life.

25:26.076 --> 25:29.562
It's the 3-year-old
who can't stop running, Maya.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.875
It's the 3-year-old
who won't let you sleep,

25:31.875 --> 25:34.463
it's the 3-year-old
who pushes everyone away

25:34.463 --> 25:38.606
who tried to tell you
that you had to stop.

25:41.609 --> 25:44.888
I miss my wife.

25:44.888 --> 25:46.234
I love my wife.

25:46.234 --> 25:48.063
I-I know.

25:50.721 --> 25:53.690
So what do I do?

25:53.690 --> 25:56.796
Like, what--
what do I do?

25:56.796 --> 25:59.454
You need to tell
the 3-year-old

25:59.454 --> 26:01.939
that she can rest now.

26:01.939 --> 26:04.701
That she's allowed
to rest.

26:04.701 --> 26:06.392
You need to tell her
that you love her

26:06.392 --> 26:09.464
and that you've got her
no matter what.

26:09.464 --> 26:10.948
That she doesn't live
with Daddy anymore,

26:10.948 --> 26:14.987
that she's safe,
that she's lovable,

26:14.987 --> 26:17.506
win or lose.

26:24.168 --> 26:26.895
- Theo! Travis!
- Hey. Hey. We're okay.
We're here.

26:26.895 --> 26:28.448
Step back. We're gonna
cut the bars, okay?

26:30.002 --> 26:31.279
That's it.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.148
Finally stupid and noble enough
for you?

26:38.148 --> 26:39.943
No, just stupid.

26:39.943 --> 26:41.979
But hey, look,
a deal's a deal.

26:41.979 --> 26:45.362
You have 72 hours of me
laying off of you and Travis.

26:45.362 --> 26:47.536
Da-da. Just for once
in your life,

26:47.536 --> 26:51.540
just for once, resist
the need to say something.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.128
Okay.

26:53.128 --> 26:55.786
Ugh.
What?

26:55.786 --> 26:57.132
That look.
What look?

26:57.132 --> 26:58.547
That look.

26:58.547 --> 27:00.515
We see it all the time.

27:00.515 --> 27:03.104
Victims post-save
get confused

27:03.104 --> 27:05.624
and they fall in love
with firefighters.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.660
Don't worry,
it'll pass.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.455
For the shoulder, ice, ibuprofen,

27:09.455 --> 27:11.388
and an ortho follow-up.

27:11.388 --> 27:14.874
For the swoons...
a cold shower.

27:14.874 --> 27:17.774
The swoons?
Who's the conceited one now?

27:22.882 --> 27:24.056
Ready?

27:24.056 --> 27:26.679
No.

27:26.679 --> 27:27.646
Because
you're embarrassed?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.130
Yes.

27:30.787 --> 27:33.582
You once told me that you think
about dying

27:33.582 --> 27:35.654
so that you can rest.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.380
That's because 3-year-old Maya
can't rest.

27:38.380 --> 27:41.798
She's too afraid that
if she does, she's not lovable.

27:44.835 --> 27:47.873
Maya, for whatever
it's worth,

27:47.873 --> 27:50.807
I am in awe of the 3-year-old
that you were.

27:50.807 --> 27:54.431
She was so smart.
She was so observant.

27:54.431 --> 27:57.434
She looked around
and she saw everything.

27:57.434 --> 28:03.060
She saw exactly what she had
to do to stay alive.

28:03.060 --> 28:07.927
She is worthy of your love
and your care.

28:07.927 --> 28:11.103
She is worthy of you risking
a little bit of embarrassment

28:11.103 --> 28:13.519
for you to love
and care for her.

28:13.519 --> 28:17.281
It's not just a little bit
of embarrassment, though.

28:17.281 --> 28:21.182
Okay.
Do you need to stop?

28:21.182 --> 28:24.564
We can stop for the day.
You've done a lot already.

28:29.121 --> 28:30.709
Okay.

28:32.918 --> 28:34.643
Can you picture her?

28:34.643 --> 28:36.611
Try to see her.

28:39.787 --> 28:42.859
Can you picture her?

28:50.142 --> 28:52.144

Theo Ruiz! You really are

30:47.190 --> 30:49.019
I'm just doing my job.

30:49.019 --> 30:51.919
All right.
Here we go. Here we go.

31:03.931 --> 31:06.865
Ruiz, you're on desk duty
the rest of this shift.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.798
Next time I catch you
failing to follow orders,

31:09.798 --> 31:11.110
I'll write you up
a reprimand.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.906
I went in
to save that civilian.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.908
You disregarded
a direct order.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.876
Oh, you wanted me to let her
go in by herself?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.256
There's a chain of command
for a reason.

31:19.256 --> 31:20.913
You wait for orders.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.466
Next time you pull a stunt
like this,

31:22.466 --> 31:24.054
I'm not just gonna
reprimand you,

31:24.054 --> 31:25.607
I'm gonna transfer you.

31:31.337 --> 31:32.476
What the hell happened?

31:32.476 --> 31:33.822
No one has any respect
for him

31:33.822 --> 31:35.100
and I think
he's starting to notice.

31:38.586 --> 31:41.037
You did
beautiful work today.

31:41.037 --> 31:44.385
There's more to do,
and we'll work together

31:44.385 --> 31:46.732
once a week for the next
few months at least.

31:46.732 --> 31:49.977
But I think you can ease back
in to desk duty

31:49.977 --> 31:52.738
if your medical team
blesses it.

31:52.738 --> 31:56.328
I want to call my wife.
Can I call my wife?

31:56.328 --> 31:57.846
Can I tell her I'm sorry?

31:57.846 --> 32:03.507
You can absolutely do
whatever you want to do.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.268
But how much have you slept
in the last two weeks?

32:05.268 --> 32:08.857
Uh, 16 hours?

32:08.857 --> 32:11.688
I think you've probably put
your wife through a lot.

32:11.688 --> 32:13.621
And if you want my advice--I do.

32:13.621 --> 32:15.692
Take care of yourself first.

32:15.692 --> 32:18.626
Work on yourself first.

32:18.626 --> 32:21.940
See if you can rest
a little first.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.631
But I love her.

32:27.669 --> 32:29.775
See if I can love
myself first?

32:29.775 --> 32:31.156
I love it
when they learn.

32:34.607 --> 32:36.161
See you next week.

32:36.161 --> 32:38.163
Bye.

32:38.163 --> 32:39.785
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

33:06.432 --> 33:07.709
You okay, Hughes?

33:13.681 --> 33:16.028
Look, I know today
was a lot.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.167
Yeah.
We got through it.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.825
Yeah, but that's not
what I mean.

33:19.825 --> 33:23.035
My heart was in my throat,
and I'm not in love with him.

33:23.035 --> 33:27.833
Look, I'm here to talk
or if you just need a break.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.352
No judgment.

33:30.905 --> 33:32.182
All right.

33:32.182 --> 33:33.804
Thanks, Ben.

33:35.772 --> 33:39.396
You know, Beckett
is down there casually acting

33:39.396 --> 33:41.847
like he didn't almost
get people killed

33:41.847 --> 33:44.022
by the fact
that he's an idiot.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.507
He said it was contained,
so what the hell exploded?

33:49.165 --> 33:50.856
I-I'm sorry.

33:50.856 --> 33:52.685
I know we're all just trying
to shake today,

33:52.685 --> 33:54.032
it's just this call,
you know?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.275
My old neighborhood,
it's...

33:56.275 --> 34:01.039
I guess, uh, this is what
they call "triggered," huh?

34:01.039 --> 34:04.214
The past just hitting you
in the face all like--

34:04.214 --> 34:06.699
Yeah, I'm triggered.

34:06.699 --> 34:07.976
You're triggered?

34:09.944 --> 34:11.946
You're triggered?!

34:11.946 --> 34:15.467
I-I am--
I am triggered.

34:15.467 --> 34:19.747
And you haven't noticed,
and you...

34:19.747 --> 34:21.576
I don't know, maybe this
is partially my fault

34:21.576 --> 34:25.201
because I don't let on,
'cause if I--

34:25.201 --> 34:27.479
if I let these feelings
I'm having even an inch past

34:27.479 --> 34:28.997
the dam that I've built
in my throat,

34:28.997 --> 34:30.758
I would drown
this whole building!

34:34.727 --> 34:38.110
Theo, you could have
died today.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.111
I know.
Yeah, you know.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.217
You and--

34:41.217 --> 34:44.461
You and Travis.

34:44.461 --> 34:46.946
My boyfriend
and my best friend.

34:46.946 --> 34:49.121
Is any of this ringing
any bells for you?

34:49.121 --> 34:51.468
Yeah.
This is--

34:51.468 --> 34:53.919
If something
had happened to you today...

34:53.919 --> 34:57.129
If something had happened
to Travis...

34:57.129 --> 34:59.097
I always feel like I have
to be the nurse...

35:02.928 --> 35:06.242
...and that's fine, but--
but if I have to play that role

35:06.242 --> 35:09.348
while being the "widow"...

35:09.348 --> 35:12.179
again?

35:12.179 --> 35:14.871
I just don't think--
I-I can't do it again.

35:17.598 --> 35:19.634
How am I having
this conversation
in a freaking towel?

35:19.634 --> 35:22.534
I'm just-- I'm a clown.

35:22.534 --> 35:27.435
Sometimes I need a nurse. Sometimes...

35:27.435 --> 35:30.162
Some--
Sometimes I need a nurse.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.819
Sometimes
I'm the one who needs--

35:47.869 --> 35:49.802
No, Travis, you don't get--
you don't get to go.

35:49.802 --> 35:52.219
Come-- Come here!

35:52.219 --> 35:53.979
I need...

36:06.750 --> 36:10.927
Finally, I want to thank
Chief Ross,

36:10.927 --> 36:14.758
Lieutenant Herrera,
and Firefighter Hughes

36:14.758 --> 36:17.761
for helping
police de-escalate the situation

36:17.761 --> 36:21.248
and ensure the safety
of young Jamal.

36:21.248 --> 36:26.425
Rest assured, the police and
firefighters of our great city

36:26.425 --> 36:31.189
will continue to work
peacefully together.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.673
Thank you.

36:38.610 --> 36:40.715
Thank you all for joining us.

36:40.715 --> 36:42.441
I want to echo
Chief Dixon...

36:47.274 --> 36:49.068
I want to...

36:54.350 --> 36:56.869
Jamal Romero was able
to go home to his mother.

37:00.425 --> 37:02.116
Jamal was able to live
another day

37:02.116 --> 37:03.600
to make his poundcake
the night

37:03.600 --> 37:05.982
that he was profiled
by the police

37:05.982 --> 37:08.709
as he was walking home
carrying nothing but butter

37:08.709 --> 37:13.161
and baking supplies
in his backpack.

37:13.161 --> 37:16.234
Jamal is alive today because
Crisis One was on the scene,

37:16.234 --> 37:18.581
<i>and this is why Crisis One</i>

37:18.581 --> 37:22.757
<i>is an essential service
for our great city.</i>

37:22.757 --> 37:24.587
<i>And this is more
than enough evidence</i>

37:24.587 --> 37:27.175
<i>that de-escalation tactics
are more successful</i>

37:27.175 --> 37:29.488
<i>than the use of force.</i>

37:29.488 --> 37:32.250
<i>Unfortunately, lack of training
and awareness</i>

37:32.250 --> 37:33.803
<i>caused the officers
on the scene</i>

37:33.803 --> 37:35.736
<i>to feel the need
to draw their weapons.</i>

37:35.736 --> 37:38.980
But to echo Chief Dixon,
our city can trust

37:38.980 --> 37:41.914
that firefighters
and police officers

37:41.914 --> 37:43.399
will continue
to work together.

37:43.399 --> 37:46.747
In fact, I invite
any members of PD

37:46.747 --> 37:48.921
who are interested in undergoing
Crisis One training--

37:48.921 --> 37:50.992
and I hope that they
would take up our offer--

37:50.992 --> 37:53.305
so no one finds themselves

37:53.305 --> 37:56.412
staring down
the barrel of injustice.

37:56.412 --> 37:58.759
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:58.759 --> 38:01.658
Wow.
She really just did that.

38:01.658 --> 38:03.211
- Yeah, she did.
- Wow.

38:03.211 --> 38:05.283
That's cool.

38:09.114 --> 38:11.358
That was awesome.

38:22.230 --> 38:24.854
You know
I actually like you, right?

38:24.854 --> 38:26.234
I think you're a good guy
and a good captain

38:26.234 --> 38:27.995
when you want to be.

38:27.995 --> 38:32.033
So why are you antagonizing
the people under this roof?

38:32.033 --> 38:34.035
How am I antagonizing
this team today, Herrera?

38:34.035 --> 38:36.210
I heard something about
a second explosion

38:36.210 --> 38:37.660
after you said
it was contained.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.040
We hadn't
started overhaul yet,

38:39.040 --> 38:40.697
which is why I ordered
Ruiz to wait outside.

38:40.697 --> 38:42.527
Sometimes there's no time
to wait

38:42.527 --> 38:44.045
for the Captain's orders,
all right?

38:44.045 --> 38:47.014
We-- We have to make a-a
snap decision to save a life.

38:47.014 --> 38:48.705
Ruiz got a member
of his team killed

38:48.705 --> 38:50.397
when he made a bad call
as a captain,

38:50.397 --> 38:53.572
so he's decided to spare me
the same fate by second-guessing

38:53.572 --> 38:55.643
every call I make,
which ironically

38:55.643 --> 38:57.680
is the very thing
that's gonna get someone killed.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.579
I hear you, Captain,
but Theo is not wrong

39:00.579 --> 39:03.996
in that
we need someone to lead.

39:03.996 --> 39:06.999
We need--
We need a North Star.

39:06.999 --> 39:10.382
Look, my-- my dad used to
take the team camping, you know?

39:10.382 --> 39:11.728
He helped build morale.
Maybe you can--Look, I'm not your--

39:11.728 --> 39:13.903
your daddy, Herrera.

39:13.903 --> 39:15.214
I'm not your dad.
I'm not gonna be him.

39:15.214 --> 39:16.940
I'm never gonna be him.
It's not my style.

39:16.940 --> 39:19.909
So what is your style?
Hmm?

39:19.909 --> 39:22.601
Seriously, what--
what is your leadership style?

39:22.601 --> 39:24.292
'Cause maybe
do more of that.

39:24.292 --> 39:26.571
Do more of that?

39:26.571 --> 39:28.400
You know what, Herrera?
No matter what I do,

39:28.400 --> 39:29.919
everyone around here
criticizes me.

39:29.919 --> 39:32.611
I give up drinking,
I-I do the job well,

39:32.611 --> 39:34.855
I play nice,
but nothing ever changes,

39:34.855 --> 39:36.443
so I might as well
just be the monster

39:36.443 --> 39:38.859
that you all think I am.

39:38.859 --> 39:39.998
Hmm?

39:42.103 --> 39:43.760
Now get out.

39:47.454 --> 39:48.938
Oh...

39:48.938 --> 39:50.698
my God.

40:20.107 --> 40:22.143
Come in.

40:22.143 --> 40:24.249
Hey.

40:24.249 --> 40:25.561
What are you doing here?

40:25.561 --> 40:27.079
I--
You can't be here.

40:27.079 --> 40:30.428
I have paperwork
for you.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.670
We're gonna keep
the lights on.

40:31.670 --> 40:32.775
We're gonna keep
the door open.

40:32.775 --> 40:35.294
I'm gonna sit on this side
of the desk,

40:35.294 --> 40:38.746
and I'm gonna just hand you
these files one by one.

40:38.746 --> 40:42.440
Because I know how hard
this was for you,

40:42.440 --> 40:44.234
and I didn't want you
to be by yourself.

40:52.139 --> 40:53.761
I fall in line.

40:53.761 --> 40:55.280
I know.
I'm a soldier.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.764
I fall in line.
I know.

40:56.764 --> 40:58.766
I could not
fall in line today.

40:58.766 --> 41:00.665
I kept picturing Jamal
on the ground,

41:00.665 --> 41:04.185
shaking and crying,
those weapons drawn on him...

41:04.185 --> 41:06.153
- I could not fall in line.
- Mm-hmm.

41:06.153 --> 41:09.225
And now I have made a permanent
enemy of Michael Dixon.

41:09.225 --> 41:13.194
Not just for me,
for all of you.

41:13.194 --> 41:14.989
Oh, yes, you did.

41:18.855 --> 41:21.375
But you got it right.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.204
I did?

41:23.204 --> 41:26.863
My love,
you got it right.
