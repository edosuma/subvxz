00:04.838 --> 00:05.922
- Hey, Bella.

00:06.005 --> 00:06.965
- Pepper, I'm thinking
of doing something

00:07.048 --> 00:09.801
that you're gonna love me doing
if I do it.

00:09.884 --> 00:11.094
- Bella, I've no idea
what it is,

00:11.177 --> 00:13.638
but now I'm so excited I hope
it lives up to the hype.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.639
- I'm thinking of entering

00:14.723 --> 00:16.933
the Young Ladies
of Silverado beauty pageant.

00:17.016 --> 00:19.310
- Ooh! So lived up to the hype.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.563
- Yay!

00:21.646 --> 00:24.357
Hooray for superficial pageants
that are a waste of time.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.110
Give me one good reason
why you want to do that.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.278
- I'll give you 10,000.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.196
That's how much scholarship
money the winner gets.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.450
- That can really help
with your college fund.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.952
The winner still gets
a sparkly tiara, right?

00:36.035 --> 00:38.288
So pretty.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.372
- There's only one problem.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.540
I need a member
of the Silverado Country Club

00:40.623 --> 00:42.542
to sponsor me.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.461
But I don't know anyone
who's that fancy.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.087
Oh, hey, Newt.

00:46.171 --> 00:49.299
- Don't look at my hair.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.176
My stepmom Brenda
insisted on driving the Ferrari

00:51.259 --> 00:52.719
with the top down.

00:52.802 --> 00:53.636
Apparently she likes to be seen.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.306
Big surprise.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.475
- Wait, Newt, your family
belongs to the country club,

00:58.558 --> 00:59.642
don't they?

00:59.726 --> 01:00.935
- Yeah.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.979
You have to eat foie gras with
the vice-president somewhere.

01:03.062 --> 01:06.900
Am I right?

01:06.983 --> 01:09.152
- Yeah.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.070
Anyway, uh, do you think
your dad could sponsor me

01:11.154 --> 01:14.032
in the Young Ladies
of Silverado pageant?

01:14.115 --> 01:14.783
- I know I'm going to regret
saying this.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.076
But, I can ask Brenda.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.203
She follows every pageant
in Texas.

01:18.286 --> 01:21.831
In fact, she was
Junior Miss West Southeast Texas

01:21.915 --> 01:23.041
five years in a row.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.335
- Wow. That's impressive.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.921
- Especially since you can
only enter three times.

01:28.004 --> 01:31.382
Don't ask me how she did that.

{\an8}- Bella,
I've got good news and bad news.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.182
{\an8}Brenda has agreed to sponsor you
in the pageant.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.642
{\an8}- That's great.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.060
{\an8}What's the bad news?

02:24.143 --> 02:26.020
{\an8}- Hey, honey.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.899
{\an8}You're new pageant
coach is here.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.361
{\an8}- That is the bad news.

02:33.444 --> 02:37.949
{\an8}- I'm Brenda Jean,
and you must be Bella Ann.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.410
{\an8}- Hi Brenda Jean,
it's nice to meet you,

02:40.493 --> 02:42.161
{\an8}and actually it's just Bella.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.998
{\an8}- Honey, pageant winners
always have two first names.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.291
{\an8}You know who said that?

02:46.374 --> 02:50.920
Five-time winner
Brenda Jean Van Der Rhoe.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.798
- And there it is.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.841
- Now before we get started,

02:54.924 --> 02:56.301
I need to get my beauty supplies
from the car.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.345
- Oh, don't worry,
I have my makeup bag right here.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.473
- Oh, isn't that perfect!

03:02.557 --> 03:06.394
For a baby.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.981
- Wow. She's a bit much.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.524
Newt, I thought you said
your stepmom

03:11.608 --> 03:13.985
was going to sponsor me,
not coach me.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.236
- That's Brenda for you.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.196
She always makes everything
about herself.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.282
She has no regard for anyone's
thoughts or feelings

03:19.365 --> 03:21.034
or how they color code
their closet.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.745
It goes Kelly green,
forest green, then army green.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.873
How hard is that?

03:26.956 --> 03:29.167
- Oh come on,
she can't be that bad.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.628
- Here we go!

03:31.711 --> 03:34.339
Three makeup cases,
twenty-feet of hair extensions,

03:34.422 --> 03:36.591
and one coach who was constantly
being mistaken

03:36.674 --> 03:38.551
for Newt's slightly
older sister.

03:38.635 --> 03:43.389
So embarrassing.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.724
Now where can I set up
my spray tan tent?

03:44.807 --> 03:48.645
Never mind,
I'm gonna scout it out.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.896
- Yep, she's a handful.

03:49.979 --> 03:50.897
Well good luck with that.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.565
- Newt. Wait.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.400
If I'm gonna win
this scholarship,

03:54.484 --> 03:57.528
I might need your help
with Brenda.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.947
- Fine, I'll stay.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.407
You'd never survive
without a Brenda buffer.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.952
- Thanks, Newt.
I really appreciate it.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.537
Is there anything
I can do to prepare?

04:06.621 --> 04:08.665
- Do you prepare
for a shark attack?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.833
No. You just swim
as fast as you can

04:10.917 --> 04:14.754
and pray your dad
doesn't marry it.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.548
- ♪

04:19.050 --> 04:19.968
- Ugh.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.970
Yesterday's practice
was bananas.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.263
I'm still feeling it.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.431
- Tell me about it.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.101
My cheer-ceps are burning.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.561
- I guess that's the price
of being an athlete.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.731
- [laughing]
- What?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.400
- What's funny?

04:35.483 --> 04:38.194
- You called yourself athletes.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.570
- Yeah.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.447
It's not like cheerleading
is a real sport like football.

04:41.531 --> 04:45.034
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what I'm saying?

04:45.118 --> 04:48.413
- No.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.456
- Cheerleaders have
the flexibility of a gymnast

04:50.540 --> 04:52.542
and the strength
of a power lifter.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.294
- Right. It must be so hard
to wave pompoms or spell out

04:55.378 --> 05:02.343
those big words like go
and team and uh...go.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.929
- I bet you two couldn't make it
through one cheer routine.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.472
- Oh really?

05:06.556 --> 05:08.266
- My associate and I
will take that bet.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.600
- Yep.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.436
And when we win you'll have
to admit that cheerleading

05:11.519 --> 05:14.272
is nothing but a sweaty
spelling bee with pompoms.

05:14.355 --> 05:18.067
- And when you lose--
- If we lose...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.194
we'll wear
those goofy male cheer uniforms

05:20.278 --> 05:22.989
and look like doofuses
for a whole day.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.574
- Okay, it's a bet.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.201
Meet us in the gym
after cheer practice tomorrow.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.955
- Oh. Oh we will,
and you'll be embarrassed.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.249
- B-E embarrassed.

05:33.332 --> 05:37.712
B-E-E-M-B-A-R...R? R?

05:37.795 --> 05:39.672
- Don't hurt yourself.
- E?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.888
- Okay. The spray tan tent
is all set up in your bedroom.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.723
You can sleep
on the floor, right?

05:48.806 --> 05:49.891
- Erm...

05:49.974 --> 05:53.269
- Okay, first up,
know your opponents.

05:53.352 --> 05:57.065
These girls prepare
their whole lives for pageants.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.484
- Whoa, they all look amazing.

05:59.567 --> 06:04.030
- And this girl is playing
Beethoven on water glasses.

06:04.113 --> 06:07.492
I'm not even sure Beethoven
could have done that.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.118
- And look at this one.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.456
She's so beautiful
and--and poised.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.833
Wait...is that you?

06:15.917 --> 06:20.338
- What? Oh it is!

06:20.421 --> 06:24.092
That is me winning
Junior Miss West Southeast Texas

06:24.175 --> 06:25.551
for the fifth time!

06:25.635 --> 06:29.138
So embarrassing.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.808
How did that get in there?

06:31.891 --> 06:35.144
- We may never know.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.271
- I--I don't know about this.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.815
How--how am I supposed
to compete with girls like that?

06:38.898 --> 06:42.693
They've being doing this forever
and I only have a couple days.

06:42.777 --> 06:43.903
I'm gonna look like a fool.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.863
- Whoa now, hold it right there.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.657
What this video
isn't showing you is that I was

06:47.740 --> 06:51.828
just as nervous as you are now
before every pageant.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.496
But I still stuck with it.

06:53.579 --> 06:57.583
And trust me, if you're half
as strong as Newt says you are,

06:57.667 --> 06:59.377
you'll be a contender
in no time.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.797
Cross my heart,
hope to dye my roots.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.007
- Thanks, Brenda.
That helps a lot.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.843
- Now first we're gonna work
on your posture.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.928
I'll go to the car,
and grab the balancing books.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.180
Let's start easy.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.059
Three bibles should do it.

07:15.143 --> 07:19.355
- Wow. Brenda's pep talk
was surprisingly...

07:19.438 --> 07:21.941
mother-ish.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.693
- It kinda was.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.028
Maybe you misjudged her?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.029
- Maybe I did.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.906
You know what?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
I'm gonna tell my dad
I was wrong.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.702
Brenda does deserve
her own house key.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.710
- [cheer music playing]

07:40.793 --> 07:42.003
- All right guys, good practice.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.006
- Oh, look, Troy.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.008
Let's see if we can get some
pointers on how to stand in line

07:47.091 --> 07:49.927
and wave shiny strips of paper.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.304
- Hey guys.

Here's the routine
you have to learn by Friday.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.184
- If I were you, I'd start
practicing...yesterday.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.852
- Practice? Please.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.021
We've seen you toss and tumble
a million times.

08:00.104 --> 08:00.938
- Uh-huh.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.106
- Interesting.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.774
Tell me then,
in the Swedish fall,

08:03.858 --> 08:04.817
which one of you is the base

08:04.901 --> 08:06.402
and which one of you
is the flyer?

08:06.485 --> 08:09.322
- I'm the base.
- I'm the base.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.909
- What we mean is--
- --our routine has two bases.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.204
- Two.
- Two.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.789
- I can't wait to see them
in those outfits when they lose.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.082
- Good luck.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.417
- Two bases.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.377
- Ridiculous.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.420
- Uh, okay.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.923
Let's, uh, start
with the...Swedish fall.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.007
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.300
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.384
- Oh, let's see.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.886
Alright.

08:31.969 --> 08:32.803
Okay.

08:32.886 --> 08:33.679
- Oh, I don't like that.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.682
- Okay. Okay.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.558
Maybe you lift me?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.809
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right.

- Okay.

- Ooh!

- Okay. All right, shake it off.

Shake it off.

We'll get this, alright?

08:56.035 --> 08:56.827
We're real athletes.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.204
- Okay.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.455

for a couple hours.

08:59.538 --> 09:00.665
- Or all night.

- That, too.

Do I have to fill out
all these forms?

need my blood type?

- It's a Texas beauty pageant.

09:23.688 --> 09:29.527
Last year I took a high heel
to the foot and lost a pint.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.654
- Excuse me, Miss Dawson,

09:31.737 --> 09:34.657
there's a teensy mistake
on your form.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.201
You listed football
as your talent.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.369
- Oh, that's no mistake.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.371
I'm my school's quarterback,

09:40.454 --> 09:42.873
so I'm planning
a football presentation.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.542
- Oh, well.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.296
We have a list of approved
talents for young ladies

09:48.379 --> 09:52.425
and, trust me, football
is hardly ladylike.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.759
- Not ladylike?

09:53.843 --> 09:54.927
Well, I disagree--

09:55.011 --> 09:58.180
- Excuse us
for one second, Carol Leigh.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.519
- Can you believe she said that?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.771
I'm a young lady,
and I love football.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.273
That's my talent.

10:07.356 --> 10:12.028
- Oh, when you told me that
I thought you were joking.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.656
I thought your talent
was comedy.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.366
Honey, I know you love football.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.118
We all do.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.745
But we gotta stick to the rules.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.413
- But that's what I--
- I am your pageant coach,

10:22.496 --> 10:24.415
and I wouldn't steer you wrong.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.167
You need to trust me.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.503
You wanna win
that scholarship money, right?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.922
Then no football.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.466
- Brenda Jean Van Der Rohe?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.009
You are my idol.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.471
Will you sign my high heel scar?

10:44.935 --> 10:47.229
- I can't believe the pageant
won't let me perform

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
my football talent.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.692
I mean winning that scholarship
would be great,

10:51.776 --> 10:53.402
but how can I pretend
to be someone I'm not?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.571
- Ooh! You can pretend to be me.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.574
I've always wanted
to win a tiara.

10:58.657 --> 11:02.161
Oh, so pretty.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.704
- I don't know why
we're still debating this.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.122
It's obvious
what you have to do.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.582
- It is?

11:06.665 --> 11:08.751
- Yep. You tell off the judges,
then bulldoze the pageant

11:08.834 --> 11:14.090
into a pile of hypocrisy
and hair extensions.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.717
- I'm not about
to bulldoze anything.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.971
But...I can't be someone
I'm not.

11:21.055 --> 11:21.722
[sighs]

11:21.806 --> 11:23.599

11:24.850 --> 11:25.935
I'm proud of you, Bella.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.397

agrees with you though.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.859

11:33.943 --> 11:37.238

- Don't you touch it.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.099
- So, Newt, things still good
with you and Brenda?

21:07.182 --> 21:08.684
- I guess you could say that.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.726
- Newty, Newty, Newty!

21:09.810 --> 21:14.356
- What up, Bren-dawg?

21:14.439 --> 21:14.481
Ooh!

21:18.402 --> 21:20.696
- Listen, all this pageant talk
has inspired me

21:20.779 --> 21:21.989
to get back in the game.

21:22.072 --> 21:27.285
I entered Mrs. West Southeast
Texas Second Wife Edition.

21:27.369 --> 21:31.456
- Wow. There really is a pageant
for everything in Texas.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.874
- You're gonna crush it, Brenda.

21:32.958 --> 21:33.834
- We're gonna crush it.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.168
I entered you, too.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.379
- I'm sorry...who?

21:37.462 --> 21:38.714
- There's a mother-son
talent performance,

21:38.797 --> 21:40.048
and I thought we'd do
some magic tricks.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.675
Who's ready to
get sawed in half?

21:41.758 --> 21:42.926
You are!

21:43.010 --> 21:45.512
See you later, Newty.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.144
- Call therapist.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.563
- [phone ringing]
- This might take a while.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.815
Hi, Ira.

22:00.777 --> 22:04.781
