00:01.460 --> 00:03.580
- What is that?
- The storm, the lightning!

00:03.615 --> 00:05.305
It's just done something to us.

00:05.340 --> 00:08.340
Something's happened
to me too. I turned invisible.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.105
Look at me!

00:11.140 --> 00:13.665
All I have to do is touch you.

00:13.700 --> 00:16.180
They'll think the probation
worker's still alive.

00:16.215 --> 00:19.277
Someone must be using his credit
card. It's them.

00:19.312 --> 00:22.340
I saw you with that girl.
It just happened, like.

00:22.375 --> 00:25.497
I didn't mean it to.

00:25.532 --> 00:28.620
My life is fucked
and that's on you.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.705
Pervert!
What are you doing?

00:38.740 --> 00:42.740
Give it back.
Come on, we'll do an interview.

00:43.340 --> 00:47.340
First question. Have you
ever had sex with a piece of fruit?

00:47.740 --> 00:51.740
Give me my phone.
Second question. Was it a melon?

00:52.220 --> 00:55.385
Ah, he's trying to kiss me!

00:55.420 --> 00:57.540
He's trying to kiss me!
Just give it back!

00:57.575 --> 00:59.660
Give him his phone back,
you prick.

00:59.695 --> 01:01.905
Ow, stop hitting me!

01:01.940 --> 01:04.980
Have your little toy. Melon-fucker!

01:05.015 --> 01:08.025
Don't touch my phone.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.820
He's got Tony's credit card.
It was in here.

01:10.855 --> 01:12.265
Why did you put it back?

01:12.300 --> 01:14.620
You need to catch him using it.
It's evidence against him.

01:14.655 --> 01:16.225
Sally...
It's here somewhere.

01:16.260 --> 01:18.940
Even if we catch him using it,
it doesn't prove he murdered Tony.

01:18.975 --> 01:21.220
How else would he have got it?
Maybe he found it.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.585
The most we can do him for is fraud.

01:23.620 --> 01:26.980
Sally, stop. He'll know someone's
been in there.

01:27.015 --> 01:29.625
Sally!

01:29.660 --> 01:33.060
You keep this up,
you're gonna lose your job.

01:33.095 --> 01:36.257
I know this is difficult.

01:36.292 --> 01:39.420
He's got Tony's credit card.

01:39.580 --> 01:43.580
I'm sorry. It's not enough.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.785
What is this?

02:42.820 --> 02:46.060
This is your chance to talk
about community service.

02:46.095 --> 02:49.305
It's... bullshit.

02:49.340 --> 02:52.260
So do you think
that you've learned anything?

02:52.295 --> 02:56.140
Yeah. Don't get caught.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.145
Fine.

02:57.180 --> 03:01.180
How do you think you've changed?
Um...

03:02.380 --> 03:05.025
I think I'm taller.

03:05.060 --> 03:09.060
They graffiti and we clean it off.
They graffiti and we clean it off.

03:09.260 --> 03:12.180
They graffiti and we clean it off.
What is that about?

03:13.815 --> 03:14.785
Hello?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.380
Rough in the jungle,
innit, in the jungle?

03:16.415 --> 03:18.140
Rough in the jungle,
innit, in the jungle?

03:18.175 --> 03:21.705
You're fuckin' lying!

03:21.740 --> 03:25.140
Do I look like I'm some kind
of fuckin' knob?

03:25.175 --> 03:28.145
Do I?

03:28.180 --> 03:31.060
It's not easy, being you, is it?

03:31.095 --> 03:33.745
What do you mean?

03:33.780 --> 03:36.060
I mean, how do you get along
with the others?

03:36.095 --> 03:39.060
It must be hard.
You're not like them.

03:39.095 --> 03:43.060
You're more... mature.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.425
Why has he been in there longer
than the rest of us?

03:46.460 --> 03:50.460
He's obviously making more progress.
He's such a little arse-kisser.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.340
So have you thought about what you
want to do when this is over?

03:57.100 --> 03:59.465
I don't know.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.300
Would you like to go to college
or get a j...?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.265
He's such a twat.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.500
Sorry, that was really
unprofessional.

04:13.535 --> 04:17.500
He is a twat.

04:18.579 --> 04:20.980
So what do you like doing?
Come on, there must be something.

04:21.015 --> 04:24.777
I like making videos,
editing them together and that.

04:24.812 --> 04:28.540
Really? Well, I have a friend
who runs an editing suite.

04:28.575 --> 04:30.620
I could ask him about some work
experience for you,

04:30.655 --> 04:32.140
if that's what you're interested in.

04:32.175 --> 04:34.385
Yeah.

04:34.420 --> 04:38.420
There's no need to look so shocked.
I'm not that bad, am I?

04:39.220 --> 04:43.220
- No.
- I should do some work.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.220
Thank you.

04:52.255 --> 04:54.145
For what?

04:54.180 --> 04:58.180
It's nice there's someone I can
actually have a conversation with.

04:58.260 --> 05:02.260
Thanks.

05:18.140 --> 05:21.465
We never did find out who was putting
notes in our lockers.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.865
What did I say? I said they had
nothing. They were just pissing

05:24.900 --> 05:28.460
You don't know what they got on us.
Maybe they're watching us right now.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.105
This shit is old news.

05:30.140 --> 05:34.140
We have outfoxed the fox,
which makes us very bloody foxy.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.065
You like that, huh? Yeah.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.500
- Do you wanna come to mine tonight?
- Can't. Gotta baby-sit my nephew.

05:41.535 --> 05:43.745
How about I come with you?

05:43.780 --> 05:47.780
My aunt and uncle are well religious.
Don't even have a TV cos of all the sex.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.840
Man, they take one look at you...

05:50.875 --> 05:53.580
Are you saying I look dirty?
Yeah.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.900
I thought that was you.
D'you want a lift?

06:10.300 --> 06:13.940
I'm offering you a lift, Simon.
It's not illegal.

06:13.975 --> 06:17.940
Get in.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.220
Hey.

06:35.900 --> 06:39.900
Let's go somewhere quiet.
OK.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.900
Why are you looking at me like that?

06:48.935 --> 06:52.900
I can't see you any more.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.140
Are you finishing with me?
I'm sorry.

06:56.175 --> 06:59.745
Tell me why. Tell me.

06:59.780 --> 07:03.140
There are things going on with me,
things I can't tell you about.

07:03.175 --> 07:06.340
What things?
It's nothing you've done. It's me.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.705
I've changed.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.440
No, you can't do this to me.

07:09.475 --> 07:11.140
Don't do this.
I'm sorry.

07:11.175 --> 07:15.140
Please.

07:26.820 --> 07:29.700
Why are you looking at me like that?

07:29.735 --> 07:33.020
It's nothing.

07:33.055 --> 07:37.020
Nothing.

07:37.580 --> 07:41.580
Let's get a drink.

07:46.660 --> 07:49.700
So what's going on
with Curtis and Alisha?

07:49.735 --> 07:52.297
Oh, come on. I'm not blind.

07:52.332 --> 07:54.860
Are they seeing each other?

07:54.895 --> 07:56.465
I suppose so.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.500
Well, Alisha's a very
beautiful girl, isn't she?

08:05.340 --> 08:08.340
So what else do you lot get up to
when I'm not around?

08:08.375 --> 08:10.817
Nothing.

08:10.852 --> 08:13.225
Really?

08:13.260 --> 08:17.260
It's OK. I'm not sure
I wanna know, anyway.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.540
So are you up to anything exciting
this evening?

08:32.340 --> 08:36.340
I'll probably just go online.
How about you?

08:36.980 --> 08:40.980
I'll watch some television,
get an early night.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.105
God, I sound boring.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.780
I don't think you're boring.

08:46.815 --> 08:50.780
Thanks.

08:51.980 --> 08:55.980
See you tomorrow.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.400
- What if I can talk to animals?
- Why would you even think that?

10:36.435 --> 10:39.400
I saw this basset hound
eating a kebab off the pavement.

10:39.435 --> 10:40.805
I was like, "You dirty bastard,"

10:40.840 --> 10:44.765
and this basset hound
gave me a right funny look.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.340
- He probably thought you were a twat.
- No, it wasn't that kind of look.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.880
It was more like, "Are you talking
to me?" "Are you talking to me?"

10:58.920 --> 11:02.840
See? Babies.
That's why I always use a condom.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.840
And if the girl looks dirty,
I use two.

11:05.875 --> 11:09.840
Belt and braces.

11:46.075 --> 11:50.040
Who's that?

11:50.160 --> 11:54.160
It's a mate.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.000
Come on, let's go again.
Really?

12:12.035 --> 12:14.440
I'm good to go.

12:14.475 --> 12:16.165
Hey, you seen Curtis?

12:16.200 --> 12:19.000
Who are you?
I'm his girlfriend.

12:19.035 --> 12:21.377
Do you know where he is?

12:21.412 --> 12:23.685
Uh...he's been arrested.

12:23.720 --> 12:27.160
What for?
For...exposing himself.

12:27.195 --> 12:29.680
What?
Yeah, flashing.

12:29.715 --> 12:31.165
At some Scouts.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.045
Try tying a knot in that!
Or maybe you have.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.840
Very funny. When you see him,
can you get him to call Sam?

12:39.480 --> 12:43.480
She seems nice.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Your girlfriend was here.
The other one.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.205
We covered for you, though.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.240
I always wanted to be a cheat.
I'm just too disorganised.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.445
I struggle to remember
one girl's name.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.720
It's not like that.
I've tried to finish with Sam.

13:02.755 --> 13:04.897
I tell her it's over,
she starts to cry

13:04.932 --> 13:07.040
and you know what it's like
when girls cry.

13:07.075 --> 13:09.005
Horrible.
I feel so guilty.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.725
Time rewinds
and it's like I never said it.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.760
I've ended it six times.
She cries, I'm back where I started.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.520
It's doing my head in.
I just need it to be over.

13:18.555 --> 13:20.925
You need to make her hate you.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.960
Seriously. She's steaming, she's
telling you you've got a tiny dick,

13:25.360 --> 13:26.845
you're crap in bed.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.880
You don't feel guilty,
maybe time won't rewind.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.540
You gotta be brutal, man.
Get her riled.

13:34.575 --> 13:37.160
Tell her she's got
nasty snatch gunk.

13:37.195 --> 13:39.485
I don't even know what that is.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.880
You know, it's the...
it's the stuff that comes out.

13:42.915 --> 13:44.525
Oh! I'm not saying that.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.440
She hasn't done nothing wrong.
I can't hurt her.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.765
I hear you, man.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.800
Don't put your arm around me.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.480
It's these powers, man.

13:58.515 --> 14:00.725
No matter what you do,

14:00.760 --> 14:04.760
the ones you love
will be the ones who pay.

14:06.480 --> 14:10.480
Right.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.680
See you later, chief.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.000
Who are you?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.560
Hello.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.400
Who are you?

15:01.560 --> 15:04.600
Finn?

15:06.680 --> 15:08.440
Where did you go, eh?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.685
Come here.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.400
He's always crawling off.
He's beautiful.

15:12.435 --> 15:13.725
Oh, thanks.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.120
- What's his name?
- Finn.

15:16.155 --> 15:18.480
Finn. So how old is he?

15:18.515 --> 15:19.885
Nine months.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.445
He must take a lot of looking after.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.960
Yeah, just a bit. Only had two
hours' sleep last night, didn't I?

15:24.995 --> 15:27.320
Is there no-one to help you?
Where's his dad?

15:27.355 --> 15:29.245
Uh, he's not around.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.280
Really? Can I...? Can I hold him?
Maybe I could play with him for a while.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.565
Huh? We could hang out.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.880
Nathan! What the hell are you doing?

15:38.915 --> 15:41.640
I found a baby.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.085
Bye, Finn!

15:43.120 --> 15:45.820
Did you see him?

15:45.855 --> 15:48.485
He is beautiful.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.360
Are you taking the piss?

15:51.395 --> 15:55.360
No.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.840
Simon.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.005
Hi.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.880
I've spoken to a few people
about getting you work experience.

16:19.915 --> 16:23.880
They're gonna come back to me.
Thanks.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.525
Are you OK?

16:27.560 --> 16:31.560
Do you...? Are you doing anything?

16:31.960 --> 16:35.765
Well, I was going home.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.840
Do you want a drink?
I mean, with me.

16:38.875 --> 16:42.377
Do you wanna go for a drink with me?

16:42.412 --> 16:45.880
Simon...I'm your probation worker.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.360
I can't.

16:52.160 --> 16:56.160
I'm sorry.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.480
Simon!

17:07.839 --> 17:11.839
Hey. What did you want
to talk to me about?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.200
I can't see you any more.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.440
You're finishing with me?

17:18.474 --> 17:21.125
Why?

17:21.760 --> 17:22.905
Cos I'm gay.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.760
You're gay?

17:30.080 --> 17:33.640
So... What, it was all a lie?

17:33.675 --> 17:35.765
Everything?
Wait...

17:35.800 --> 17:38.980
How could you do that to me?
What are you doing?

17:39.015 --> 17:42.160
Do I mean nothing to you?
Wait, no, don't cry.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.840
Hey. What did you want
to talk to me about?

17:47.875 --> 17:49.405
I can't see you any more.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.860
You're finishing with me? Why?

17:51.895 --> 17:54.280
Cos you're fat. You're large.

17:54.315 --> 17:55.765
Kind of round.
What?

17:55.800 --> 17:58.880
I've got three months left to live.
I don't want to waste it with you.

17:58.915 --> 18:02.057
Cos I'm impotent
and I know how much you love cock.

18:02.092 --> 18:05.200
Why are you being like this?
Cos you got...weird tits.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.800
And nasty snatch gunk.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.645
I'm sorry.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.925
You're finishing with me?

18:09.960 --> 18:12.165
And you're gonna ask me why
and I can't tell you.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.200
There are things going on with me,
things I can't tell you about.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.200
No matter what I do, the ones I love
will be the ones who pay.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.080
Is that from Spider-Man?

18:26.115 --> 18:28.097
What?
What you just said.

18:28.132 --> 18:30.045
That's from Spider-Man.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.680
You're dumping me
with a line from Spider-Man?

18:32.715 --> 18:33.805
No, no.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.605
You immature, pathetic, shallow
bastard!

18:35.640 --> 18:38.440
- It's not from Spider-Man!
- Have you got no respect for me?

18:38.475 --> 18:40.360
- I thought you were better than that.
- Sam!

18:41.395 --> 18:44.360
You stay away from me!

18:55.160 --> 18:59.160
Done.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.160
They asked me if I wanted
small or large.

19:03.195 --> 19:05.520
- I said large.
- You trying to get me drunk?

19:05.555 --> 19:07.165
No.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.205
I'm joking.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.605
Maybe I should get you drunk.
Why?

19:12.640 --> 19:16.640
Because I reckon you're quite cute
when you're drunk.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.400
Who's that?
I went to school with him.

19:25.435 --> 19:28.325
A friend?

19:28.360 --> 19:31.125
He lives next door to me.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.520
He stopped speaking to me
when we started secondary school.

19:34.555 --> 19:38.520
Did he give you a hard time?

19:39.560 --> 19:43.560
Every morning when I woke up,
I felt sick just thinking about it.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.280
I told my parents and the teachers.

19:47.315 --> 19:50.160
They knew it was happening.

19:50.195 --> 19:54.005
No-one did anything.

19:54.040 --> 19:58.040
Was it his house
you tried to burn down?

20:02.040 --> 20:06.040
A few months ago, he sent me
a text inviting me to this club.

20:07.120 --> 20:11.120
I thought he wanted to apologise.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.200
I get to the club,
I walk up to him and his mates.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.725
He texted me by mistake.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.600
It was so humiliating.
Simon...

20:20.635 --> 20:24.600
I was so angry, I...

20:25.880 --> 20:27.325
I got drunk.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.000
I started thinking about everything
he did to me at school.

20:31.035 --> 20:33.485
I lost it.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.605
I went round to his house.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.525
I made sure his family were out.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.085
I soaked some tissues
in lighter fluid.

20:41.120 --> 20:45.120
I lit them and dropped them
through the letterbox.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.000
There was a cat.
A cat?

20:49.035 --> 20:50.965
Inside the house.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.760
I thought, "The cat
didn't bully me at school.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.485
"He hasn't done anything."

20:56.520 --> 20:58.760
The carpet was just starting
to catch alight.

20:58.795 --> 21:00.440
The cat was freaking out.

21:00.475 --> 21:02.877
What did you do?

21:02.912 --> 21:05.280
I put the fire out.

21:05.315 --> 21:09.280
How?

21:10.800 --> 21:14.800
I pissed through the letterbox.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.405
This is when his mum comes home.
She starts screaming.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.440
You know what it's like once
you've started. It's hard to stop.

21:21.475 --> 21:23.537
It's not funny.

21:23.572 --> 21:25.600
Sorry.

21:25.635 --> 21:28.817
I'm sorry.

22:08.240 --> 22:12.240
So are you gonna walk me home?

22:14.080 --> 22:17.685
Let's go.

22:17.720 --> 22:21.720
Let's give them something
to talk about.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.640
All right?

22:41.240 --> 22:45.240
This is me.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.680
Do you wanna come in?

23:09.720 --> 23:13.720
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

23:14.040 --> 23:18.040
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.320
See you tomorrow.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.480
So did you go with
"nasty snatch gunk", yeah?

25:36.515 --> 25:38.720
- Tried it.
- Seriously?

25:38.755 --> 25:39.717
Yeah.

25:41.652 --> 25:44.980
It's done. It's over.

25:46.340 --> 25:49.420
You know what you said about,
"No matter what you do,

25:49.455 --> 25:51.700
"the ones you love
will be the ones who pay"?

25:53.540 --> 25:55.040
Is that from Spider-Man?

25:55.075 --> 25:56.940
I don't know. I was just trying
to sound intelligent.

25:56.975 --> 25:58.425
Prick.

25:58.460 --> 26:01.340
Why are you complaining?
You got away with it.

26:01.375 --> 26:05.340
Alisha didn't find out.
Job done. Sorted.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.340
Do you hear that?

26:52.500 --> 26:55.000
- What?
- A baby crying.

26:56.435 --> 26:58.500
What are you talking about?

27:15.980 --> 27:17.700
Do you hear that?

27:17.735 --> 27:19.777
What?

27:19.812 --> 27:22.816
The baby.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.905
Hey there, little man.

27:39.940 --> 27:43.940
Oh! It's all right. I'm here.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.320
I think I've just seen Nathan
stealing a baby.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.520
He just ran off with it.

28:05.555 --> 28:07.085
Why would he take a baby?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.800
If he gets caught, he's screwed.

28:08.835 --> 28:12.800
Call the prick.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.160
Switched off.
Fuck's sake.

28:17.195 --> 28:21.160
We need to find him.

28:21.680 --> 28:25.680
Come on!

28:35.835 --> 28:37.365
What's he doing?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.565
What the fuck are you doing?

28:56.600 --> 28:58.845
Hey! There's no need
for language like that.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.600
Don't listen to her. That's a very
bad word and she should know better.

29:02.635 --> 29:05.360
You're acting like a freak.
Give us the baby.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.525
You're not taking him! He needs me.

29:07.560 --> 29:11.560
I think he's gone mental.
'Be my daddy. Be my daddy.'

29:11.595 --> 29:13.045
Be my daddy. Be my daddy.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.920
Be my daddy. Be my daddy.
Be my daddy.

29:14.955 --> 29:17.765
The baby, he's got power.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.600
He's making you think
that you're the dad.

29:20.635 --> 29:23.365
He needs a dad.
I know what that's like.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.005
My dad was never around.
Look what it did to me.

29:26.040 --> 29:30.040
I'm gonna be his daddy.
You? You're gonna be its dad?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.680
You're a homeless. You're living
in the community centre.

29:33.715 --> 29:35.045
You got no money, no job.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.280
You're poor.
And you've got a criminal record.

29:38.315 --> 29:39.965
You can barely look after yourself.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.420
Social Services
will take one look at you...

29:42.455 --> 29:44.805
Seriously, the kid deserves better.
Way better.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.920
Him and his mum can come and live
with me at the community centre.

29:47.955 --> 29:50.485
I can get free food
from the vending machines.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.120
I'll steal booze from the kitchen.
I'll steal from other babies.

29:53.155 --> 29:57.120
I'll go to the park
and forage for nuts and berries.

30:01.160 --> 30:05.160
You prick.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.525
Why am I holding this baby?

30:08.560 --> 30:11.440
I'm not being sexist but one of
you girls needs to take this off me

30:11.475 --> 30:15.440
before I drop it on its head.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.120
Why have you got my baby?!
Yeah...

30:19.155 --> 30:20.880
Did you take him?
No! No.

30:20.915 --> 30:22.405
You stay away from him!

30:22.440 --> 30:25.080
All right? You stay away from him.
He didn't take him.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.240
We found him outside.
We were bringing him back.

30:27.275 --> 30:28.885
He's all right.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.920
Why do you keep crawling off? Eh?
He already thinks I'm a shit mum.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.445
I don't know what to do.
It's like I'm not enough for him.

30:35.480 --> 30:38.860
You should take him to see his dad.
Yeah, well, he's not interested.

30:38.895 --> 30:42.240
Trust me, as soon as he sees him,
he'll want to be his dad again.

30:42.275 --> 30:46.240
I promise ya.

30:46.920 --> 30:50.920
Yeah, well,
thanks for bringing him back.

30:54.040 --> 30:58.040
Well, look at you, using your
powers, being all superhero.

31:21.760 --> 31:25.760
So is it always this tidy
or is it just to impress me?

31:25.960 --> 31:29.960
It's always this tidy.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.800
Is this all the stuff
you've recorded? Some of it.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.565
Most of it's on hard drive.

31:39.600 --> 31:43.600
Well, I'd love to watch something.

31:48.240 --> 31:52.240
That's really good.
You're very talented.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.285
What's this?

31:59.320 --> 32:02.040
Do you remember that storm
a few weeks ago?

32:02.075 --> 32:04.725
Yeah, it was just before I started,
wasn't it?

32:04.760 --> 32:07.760
Do you have any more footage?
I'd love to see that.

32:08.795 --> 32:10.920
That's it.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.760
Do you want a coffee?

32:17.795 --> 32:19.760
Love one.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.845
Simon, I've got to go.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.400
I've got a friend coming over
and I completely forgot. I'm sorry.

32:48.435 --> 32:51.160
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:51.195 --> 32:55.160
I'm really sorry.

33:06.440 --> 33:09.000
What is going on
with this weather?

33:09.752 --> 33:11.000
That's my car.

33:18.260 --> 33:22.260
What have I told you
about filming us on that thing?!

33:32.660 --> 33:35.305
Hi.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.940
There's something
I need to tell you.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.825
Alisha, it's not how it sounds!

33:39.860 --> 33:41.740
How long?
How long have you been with her?

33:41.775 --> 33:43.665
It's complicated.

33:43.700 --> 33:47.340
You're the first person I've been
faithful to and you're cheating on me?

33:47.375 --> 33:51.300
You have no idea what happened to me
last week. You don't know!

33:51.335 --> 33:54.500
All right, there's another version
of history, yeah?

33:54.535 --> 33:55.985
There's a few versions.

33:56.020 --> 33:59.780
In the first one, Sam went to jail
for a drug deal that went bad.

33:59.815 --> 34:02.465
It was my fault. I turned back time.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.500
I had the chance to change everything
but I messed up and Sam died.

34:06.535 --> 34:09.705
So I went back again,
to save her, which I did,

34:09.739 --> 34:12.020
but that meant you
and all the others, Simon and Kelly,

34:12.054 --> 34:13.505
you all died.

34:13.540 --> 34:15.225
So I went back again.

34:15.260 --> 34:18.344
I saved Sam and you
and everyone else.

34:18.380 --> 34:22.380
I come back to the present and...
and Sam's still my girlfriend.

34:24.820 --> 34:28.820
- Only you are too.
- Seriously?

34:29.179 --> 34:33.179
Yeah.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.264
Were you with her when
you were getting together with me?

34:39.300 --> 34:44.600
Not the first time but everything
changed, so...I guess I must've been.

34:44.780 --> 34:48.540
Wait. Are you cheating on me with her
or are you cheating on her with me?

34:48.574 --> 34:51.377
I have no idea. I didn't mean
to cheat on either of you.

34:51.411 --> 34:54.416
- Don't even know if it is cheating.
- I split up with her.

34:54.451 --> 34:57.385
I couldn't lie to you.
I don't want us to be like that.

34:57.420 --> 35:01.340
Oh, I get it. So you're telling me,
even though you didn't have to.

35:01.375 --> 35:03.145
Yeah.

35:03.180 --> 35:05.705
I can't do these big
relationship moments, all right?

35:05.740 --> 35:09.500
I won't shag anyone either,
and if I do, I'll tell you about it.

35:09.535 --> 35:11.500
Just don't shag anyone else,
full stop.

35:11.535 --> 35:15.500
- Fine!
- Fine.

35:18.700 --> 35:22.700
So I guess we're
getting serious, then.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.865
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:31.900 --> 35:35.900
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to leave early yesterday.

35:36.340 --> 35:40.340
It's fine.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.665
You've...

35:45.700 --> 35:49.700
You've got dirt on your face.

35:56.700 --> 36:00.700
I'll see you later.

36:06.220 --> 36:08.660
No way!
What?

36:08.695 --> 36:11.065
You and her?

36:11.100 --> 36:14.425
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about...

36:14.460 --> 36:18.300
Don't tell anyone. Don't tell Nathan!
I won't tell that prick anything.

36:18.335 --> 36:21.420
Fit older woman.

36:21.455 --> 36:25.185
Heavy.

36:25.220 --> 36:26.400
Curtis?

36:26.935 --> 36:30.900
Thanks.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.605
Come on, baby. Come on, now.

36:36.640 --> 36:40.520
Oh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.

36:40.555 --> 36:41.520
Come on, baby!

36:50.440 --> 36:54.440
Is that your tea?
Starter, main course, dessert.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.000
And a nice refreshing beverage
to wash it down.

36:57.035 --> 36:58.245
You can't live on that shit.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.040
Why don't you come round my house
and I'll cook you dinner?

37:01.075 --> 37:03.805
What are you cooking?
Chicken nuggets.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.005
I didn't realise
you were a trained chef.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.720
Do you wanna come or not?
Are you asking me round for sex?

37:09.755 --> 37:11.485
Oh, for God's sake.

37:11.520 --> 37:15.520
She's cooking me "tea", man.
I think I'm in there. Phwoar!

37:30.880 --> 37:33.080
I saw the light was on.

37:33.115 --> 37:35.280
Have the others gone?

37:35.315 --> 37:39.280
Yeah.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.480
This, seeing you like this...

37:56.440 --> 37:58.820
I could lose my job.

37:58.855 --> 38:01.165
I won't tell anyone.

38:01.200 --> 38:05.040
But I'm your probation worker.

38:05.075 --> 38:08.125
It's wrong.

38:08.160 --> 38:12.160
Do you want me to go?
No.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.820
I'm such an idiot.

38:15.855 --> 38:18.600
You're not an idiot.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.560
Do you want a drink?

38:20.595 --> 38:24.560
Yeah.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.960
You get some wine from the kitchen.

38:33.995 --> 38:37.960
I'll lock up.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.045
So is it true?

38:48.080 --> 38:52.080
What you said about
your dad not being around?

38:52.800 --> 38:56.640
What if it is?

38:56.675 --> 39:00.480
Moving on.

39:01.360 --> 39:05.360
The thing with me snatching the
baby...

39:06.920 --> 39:08.005
You know...

39:08.040 --> 39:11.440
What's that? Are you thanking me
for saving your arse?

39:11.475 --> 39:13.440
I guess I am.

39:20.640 --> 39:24.640
These chicken nuggets
are cooked to perfection.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.165
What?

39:41.200 --> 39:45.200
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

39:46.120 --> 39:47.605
Who was she?

39:47.640 --> 39:49.200
I met her on holiday.

39:49.235 --> 39:52.645
Really?

39:52.680 --> 39:56.680
Did you ever...?

39:56.720 --> 39:59.560
Did you ever have sex?

39:59.595 --> 40:02.997
We just held hands.

40:03.032 --> 40:06.400
We were only nine.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.800
Come here.

40:16.835 --> 40:18.725
Why?

40:18.760 --> 40:22.760
Because I want to kiss you.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.920
You go get more wine.

41:11.240 --> 41:15.240
'What have I told you
about filming us on that thing?'

41:35.800 --> 41:36.845
'Pervert!'

41:36.880 --> 41:40.880
'Here, have your little toy.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.780
'It's like that, is it?
So much for being united

41:59.815 --> 42:03.040
'by a horrific, life-changing,
shared experience.'

42:13.040 --> 42:17.040
'You know, the situation.
We killed our probation worker!'

42:25.360 --> 42:27.845
'It's like that, is it?

42:27.880 --> 42:30.600
'So much for being united by a
horrific,

42:30.635 --> 42:34.600
'life-changing, shared experience.'

42:36.200 --> 42:39.840
'Last week. You know.

42:39.875 --> 42:41.760
'The situation.'

42:41.795 --> 42:44.445
Oh, Jesus.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.840
'We killed our probation worker.'

42:46.875 --> 42:49.200
You shouldn't have taken my phone.

42:49.235 --> 42:52.165
Give me the phone.

42:52.200 --> 42:56.200
You killed him.
We had to.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.085
He was crazy.

42:58.120 --> 43:02.120
He was going to kill us.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.580
Tony wouldn't hurt anyone.

43:04.615 --> 43:06.987
The storm changed him.

43:07.022 --> 43:09.325
It changed us all.

43:09.360 --> 43:13.360
We have to tell the police.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.800
You were just using me.

43:15.835 --> 43:18.605
No.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.725
Simon, no.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.480
This is what you were after.

43:22.515 --> 43:24.257
I had to find out what happened.

43:24.292 --> 43:25.965
This was the only way. I'm sorry.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.605
I know it wasn't you.
It was them, wasn't it?

43:29.640 --> 43:33.560
You have to give evidence
against them. I'll help you.

43:33.595 --> 43:36.085
Give me my phone!

43:36.120 --> 43:39.725
Why are you protecting them?!

43:39.760 --> 43:43.760
You told me how they treat you.
They ignore you.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.900
You told me you were lonely.

43:47.935 --> 43:50.760
I never said that to you.

43:53.960 --> 43:57.085
You?

43:57.120 --> 43:59.520
You're Shygirl?

43:59.555 --> 44:01.885
I loved Tony.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.080
I just wanted to know what happened.

44:04.115 --> 44:07.377
I didn't want to lie to you.

44:07.412 --> 44:10.640
You're not like them, Simon.

44:10.675 --> 44:14.640
You're not.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.240
But you're the only person
that can help me.

44:19.880 --> 44:23.880
I need you.

44:26.320 --> 44:29.760
Would you do this for me?

44:29.795 --> 44:33.717
Please?

44:33.752 --> 44:37.640
Please?

44:56.200 --> 45:00.200
Shit!

45:13.800 --> 45:17.800
Simon?

45:59.640 --> 46:02.720
I can't let you go to the police.

46:02.755 --> 46:05.800
Simon, you don't owe them anything.

46:07.080 --> 46:11.080
They're the only friends I've got.

47:37.535 --> 47:39.445
I'm looking for Sally.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.760
- We can help you, Curtis.
- Nathan!

47:42.295 --> 47:43.685
- Go!
- Kelly!

47:43.720 --> 47:46.480
I've always had a set of balls.
You've just never seen them.

47:46.515 --> 47:49.360
That is about the
gayest thing I've ever heard.

47:49.395 --> 47:51.640
Get on with it, you little freak!

47:51.675 --> 47:53.140
Alisha, stop!

47:56.040 --> 47:58.045
I'm sorry.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.840
I will put a bullet in your skull!

47:59.875 --> 48:01.877
Kelly, don't!
Everybody down.

48:01.912 --> 48:03.845
We fucked up bigger and better

48:03.880 --> 48:06.480
than any generation
that's come before us.

48:06.515 --> 48:10.480
We were so beautiful!

48:11.305 --> 48:17.377
