04:52.847 --> 04:55.388
<i>- Prove it!</i>

04:55.388 --> 04:57.588
<i>I'm drunk
in the back of the car</i>

04:57.588 --> 05:00.349
<i>And I cried like a baby
coming home from the bar</i>

05:00.349 --> 05:01.658
<i>Oh</i>

05:01.658 --> 05:03.220
<i>Said, "I'm fine"

<i>I don't wanna keep secrets
just to keep you</i>

05:06.157 --> 05:09.160
<i>And I snuck in
through the garden gate</i>

05:09.160 --> 05:11.360
<i>Every night that summer
just to seal my fate</i>

05:11.360 --> 05:12.669
<i>Oh</i>

05:12.669 --> 05:14.605
<i>And I screamed
for whatever it's worth</i>

<i>"I love you"</i>

05:16.035 --> 05:18.169
<i>Ain't that the worst thing

05:18.169 --> 05:20.446
<i>He looks up
grinning like a devil</i>

05:20.446 --> 05:23.339
<i>It's new
The shape of your body</i>

05:23.339 --> 05:25.781
<i>It's blue
The feeling I've got</i>

05:25.781 --> 05:28.685

<i>Oh, L.A., you're making me
feel excellent right now.</i>

07:41.787 --> 07:43.347
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

07:44.691 --> 07:46.790
<i>let me just try something.</i>

08:08.407 --> 08:10.847
<i>Uh-oh. I mean, this...</i>

08:10.847 --> 08:12.442
<i>This is getting dangerous.</i>

08:12.442 --> 08:14.785
<i>This is about to start going
to my head real fast.</i>

08:14.785 --> 08:17.216
<i>I mean,
you just made me feel so...</i>

08:19.550 --> 08:21.550
<i>so powerful.</i>

08:49.481 --> 08:50.480
<i>I mean,</i>

08:51.582 --> 08:53.252
<i>you're making me feel...</i>

08:54.827 --> 08:57.058
<i>like I get to play
a sold-out show</i>

08:57.058 --> 08:58.664
<i>at SoFi Stadium tonight.</i>

09:20.576 --> 09:22.083
<i>I guess what I'm trying
to say is</i>

<i>you're making me feel like
I'm</i> The Man.

09:27.352 --> 09:28.958
<i>I would be complex</i>

09:29.521 --> 09:31.829
<i>I would be cool</i>

09:31.829 --> 09:33.292
<i>They'd say
I played the field</i>

09:33.292 --> 09:36.295
<i>Before I found
someone to commit to</i>

09:36.295 --> 09:38.132
<i>And that would be okay</i>

09:38.132 --> 09:39.738
<i>For me to do</i>

09:40.631 --> 09:42.367
<i>Every conquest I had made</i>

09:42.367 --> 09:44.842
<i>Would make me
more of a boss to you</i>

09:46.307 --> 09:48.340
<i>I'd be a fearless leader</i>

09:48.340 --> 09:50.375

<i>When everyone believes ya</i>

<i>What's that like?</i>

<i>I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can</i>

<i>If I was a man</i>

10:02.959 --> 10:06.061
<i>And I'm so sick of them

10:24.310 --> 10:25.674
<i>They wouldn't
shake their heads</i>

10:25.674 --> 10:28.677
<i>And question
how much of this I deserve</i>

10:28.677 --> 10:30.085
<i>What I was wearing</i>

10:30.923 --> 10:32.054
<i>If I was rude</i>

10:33.090 --> 10:34.551
<i>Could all be separated</i>

10:34.551 --> 10:37.422
<i>From my good ideas
and power moves</i>

10:38.722 --> 10:40.227

<i>- Hey!
- Let the players play</i>

10:43.133 --> 10:45.331

11:07.828 --> 11:09.729
<i>- I'd be the man
- Man</i>

11:11.458 --> 11:12.897
<i>What's it like
to brag about</i>

11:12.897 --> 11:14.294
<i>Raking in dollars</i>

11:14.294 --> 11:16.527
<i>And getting
bitches and models</i>

11:16.527 --> 11:18.529
<i>And it's all good
if you're bad</i>

11:18.529 --> 11:20.729
<i>And it's okay
if you're mad</i>

11:20.729 --> 11:22.907
<i>If I was out
flashing my dollars</i>

11:22.907 --> 11:24.975
<i>I'd be a bitch, not a baller</i>

11:24.975 --> 11:27.076
<i>They'd paint me out
to be bad</i>

11:27.076 --> 11:30.046
<i>So it's okay that I'm mad</i>

11:39.123 --> 11:43.653
<i>I'm so sick of running

<i>But you're coming
at my friends like a missile</i>

12:59.234 --> 13:00.565
<i>Why are you mad?</i>

13:02.173 --> 13:03.337
<i>When you could be GLAAD?</i>

13:04.340 --> 13:05.570
<i>GLAAD</i>

13:05.570 --> 13:08.507
<i>Sunshine on the street

<i>And then try
to restore the peace</i>

13:22.719 --> 13:24.193
<i>And control your urges
to scream</i>

13:24.193 --> 13:26.459
<i>About all the people

<i>Comparing all the girls
who are killing it</i>

13:59.756 --> 14:01.527
<i>But we figured you out</i>

14:01.527 --> 14:04.233
<i>We all know now
We all got crowns</i>

14:04.233 --> 14:07.566
<i>- You need to calm down
- Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

14:07.566 --> 14:09.975
<i>Let me see your hands!</i>

14:09.975 --> 14:11.471
<i>You need to calm down</i>

14:12.903 --> 14:14.342
<i>You're being too loud</i>

14:15.444 --> 14:17.741
<i>And I'm just like
oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

14:17.741 --> 14:21.217
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh</i>

14:21.217 --> 14:22.812
<i>You need to just stop</i>

14:22.812 --> 14:24.220
<i>Can you stop?</i>

14:24.220 --> 14:26.783
<i>Like, can you just
not step on our gowns?</i>

14:26.783 --> 14:28.587
<i>You need to calm down</i>

14:58.289 --> 14:59.992
<i>It is</i>

14:59.992 --> 15:03.655
<i>an honor and a delight
to say these words to you.</i>

15:03.655 --> 15:06.130
<i>Welcome to
The Eras Tour.</i>

15:15.900 --> 15:17.702
<i>I mean, look at you, though.</i>

15:17.702 --> 15:20.045
<i>Like, look at what I get
to play with tonight.</i>

15:20.045 --> 15:22.806
<i>I get to sing with you,
and dance with you,</i>

15:22.806 --> 15:24.313
<i>and vibe with you,</i>

15:24.313 --> 15:26.282
<i>and hang out with you
all night. Look at you.</i>

15:26.282 --> 15:28.878
<i>- You know,</i>

15:28.878 --> 15:32.717
<i>we get a good sense of a crowd
in the first couple of songs.</i>

15:32.717 --> 15:34.191
<i>We realize if
it's going to be</i>

15:34.191 --> 15:36.028
<i>like a soulmate crowd situation,</i>

15:36.028 --> 15:38.888
<i>and it feels so promising,
I just have to
tell you that.</i>

15:38.888 --> 15:40.692
<i>It's looking so good.</i>

15:47.569 --> 15:49.140
<i>So you and I,</i>

15:49.140 --> 15:51.076
<i>we're about to go on
a little adventure together.</i>

15:51.076 --> 15:54.706
<i>And that adventure is going
to span 17 years of music,</i>

15:54.706 --> 15:58.083
<i>and it's going to be
one era at a time.</i>

15:58.083 --> 16:00.349
<i>- How does that sound to you?</i>

16:05.257 --> 16:06.586
<i>All right,
so let me tell you</i>

16:06.586 --> 16:08.654
<i>my secret little dream
for this evening.</i>

16:08.654 --> 16:10.689
<i>So these are songs</i>

16:10.689 --> 16:13.362
<i>that I have written
about my life</i>

16:13.362 --> 16:15.265
<i>or things I felt
at one point in time</i>

16:15.265 --> 16:16.497
<i>whether I was a teenager,</i>

16:16.497 --> 16:19.665
<i>in my 20s,
or a couple years ago,</i>

16:19.665 --> 16:21.535
<i>but after tonight,
when you hear these songs</i>

16:21.535 --> 16:23.174
<i>out and about in the world,</i>

16:23.174 --> 16:26.243
<i>my dream is that you're gonna
think about tonight</i>

16:26.243 --> 16:29.004
<i>and the memories we made
here together at SoFi Stadium.</i>

16:30.676 --> 16:31.842
<i>I'll be your host
this evening.</i>

16:31.842 --> 16:33.712
<i>My name is Taylor.</i>

16:33.712 --> 16:35.516
<i>Thank you for traveling
with us here
at The Eras Tour.</i>

16:37.452 --> 16:41.489
<i>We could leave
the Christmas lights
up till January</i>

16:44.494 --> 16:48.562
<i>This is our place
We make the rules</i>

16:50.170 --> 16:52.060
<i>And there's a dazzling haze</i>

16:52.060 --> 16:55.173
<i>A mysterious way
about you, dear</i>

16:58.145 --> 17:02.609
<i>Have I known you
20 seconds or 20 years?</i>

17:04.448 --> 17:10.485
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

17:11.356 --> 17:16.623
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

17:16.623 --> 17:19.461
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

17:19.461 --> 17:23.102
<i>Take me out
and take me home</i>

17:25.095 --> 17:30.835
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

17:31.508 --> 17:32.507
<i>Lover</i>

17:40.517 --> 17:45.388
<i>We could let our friends
crash in the living room</i>

17:47.557 --> 17:50.987
<i>This is our place
We make the call</i>

17:53.233 --> 17:55.332
<i>And I'm highly suspicious</i>

17:55.332 --> 17:58.665
<i>That everyone who sees you
wants you</i>

17:59.998 --> 18:03.098
<i>I've loved you
three summers now, honey</i>

18:03.098 --> 18:05.903
<i>But I want 'em all</i>

18:07.379 --> 18:14.384
<i>- Can I go where you go?</i>

18:14.384 --> 18:19.653
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

18:19.653 --> 18:22.491
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

18:22.491 --> 18:26.165
<i>Take me out
and take me home</i>

18:26.827 --> 18:28.563
<i>Forever and ever</i>

18:28.563 --> 18:34.096
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

18:34.868 --> 18:36.241
<i>Lover</i>

18:36.241 --> 18:39.068
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand?</i>

18:39.068 --> 18:42.841
<i>With every guitar string
scar on my hand</i>

18:42.841 --> 18:49.848
<i>I take this magnetic force
of a man to be my lover</i>

18:49.848 --> 18:53.258
<i>My heart's been borrowed
and yours has been blue</i>

18:53.258 --> 18:56.558
<i>All's well that ends well
to end up with you</i>

18:56.558 --> 19:03.598
<i>Swear to be overdramatic
and true to my lover</i>

19:03.598 --> 19:05.028
<i>And you'll save</i>

19:05.028 --> 19:09.670
<i>All your dirtiest jokes for me</i>

19:09.670 --> 19:15.874
<i>And at every table
I'll save you a seat</i>

19:15.874 --> 19:17.744
<i>Lover</i>

19:17.744 --> 19:23.486
<i>Can I go where you go?</i>

19:24.456 --> 19:29.426
<i>Can we always be this close?</i>

19:29.426 --> 19:32.627
<i>Forever and ever, and, ah</i>

19:32.627 --> 19:36.532
<i>Take me out
and take me home</i>

19:36.532 --> 19:38.468
<i>Forever and ever</i>

19:38.468 --> 19:44.969
<i>You're my, my, my, my</i>

19:44.969 --> 19:51.613
<i>Oh, you're my, my, my, my</i>

19:51.613 --> 19:57.949
<i>Oh, darling
You're my, my, my, my</i>

19:58.820 --> 20:00.886
<i>Lover</i>

20:49.134 --> 20:51.508
<i>There's something
about the way</i>

20:51.508 --> 20:54.203
<i>The street looks
when it's just rained</i>

20:54.203 --> 20:56.843
<i>There's a glow
off the pavement</i>

20:56.843 --> 20:58.779
<i>You walk me to the car</i>

20:58.779 --> 21:03.718
<i>And you know I wanna
ask you to dance right there</i>

21:03.718 --> 21:07.458
<i>In the middle
of the parking lot</i>

21:07.458 --> 21:08.591
<i>Yeah</i>

21:17.998 --> 21:20.163
<i>We're drivin' down the road</i>

21:20.163 --> 21:22.869
<i>I wonder if you know</i>

21:22.869 --> 21:27.577
<i>I'm trying so hard
not to get caught up now</i>

21:27.577 --> 21:29.579
<i>But you're just so cool</i>

21:29.579 --> 21:32.076
<i>Run your hands
through your hair</i>

21:32.076 --> 21:37.015
<i>Absentmindedly makin' me want you</i>

21:37.015 --> 21:41.987
<i>And I don't know
how it gets better than this</i>

21:41.987 --> 21:46.662
<i>You take my hand and drag me
headfirst, fearless</i>

21:46.662 --> 21:51.865
<i>And I don't know why
but with you I'd dance</i>

21:51.865 --> 21:56.408
<i>In a storm in my best dress Fearless</i>

22:05.980 --> 22:09.949
<i>Well, you stood there
with me in the doorway</i>

22:09.949 --> 22:14.558
<i>My hands shake
I'm not usually this way</i>

22:14.558 --> 22:19.288
<i>But you pull me in
and I'm a little more brave</i>

22:19.288 --> 22:21.928
<i>It's the first kiss
it's flawless</i>

22:21.928 --> 22:24.128
<i>Really somethin'</i>

22:25.835 --> 22:28.000
<i>It's fearless</i>

22:31.742 --> 22:35.139
<i>Oh, oh, oh, yeah</i>

22:37.308 --> 22:41.915
<i>And I don't know
how it gets better than this</i>

22:41.915 --> 22:46.458
<i>You take my hand and drag me
headfirst, fearless</i>

22:46.458 --> 22:51.892
<i>And I don't know why
but with you I'd dance</i>

22:51.892 --> 22:56.160
<i>In a storm in my best dress Fearless</i>

22:57.966 --> 22:59.262
<i>Oh, oh</i>

23:00.034 --> 23:01.605
<i>Oh, oh, yeah</i>

23:15.487 --> 23:16.752
<i>All right, L.A.,
are you ready</i>

23:16.752 --> 23:18.281
<i>to go back
to high school with me?</i>

23:21.693 --> 23:24.287
<i>You're on the phone
with your girlfriend</i>

23:24.287 --> 23:25.794
<i>She's upset</i>

23:25.794 --> 23:29.358
<i>She's going off about
something that you said</i>

23:29.358 --> 23:34.572
<i>She doesn't
get your humor like I do</i>

23:36.642 --> 23:37.971
<i>I'm in my room</i>

23:37.971 --> 23:40.512
<i>It's a typical Tuesday night</i>

23:40.512 --> 23:44.208
<i>I'm listening to the kind
of music she doesn't like</i>

23:44.208 --> 23:49.554
<i>And she'll never
know your story like I do</i>

23:51.085 --> 23:54.823
<i>But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts</i>

23:54.823 --> 23:58.827
<i>She's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers</i>

23:58.827 --> 24:02.160
<i>Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find</i>

24:02.160 --> 24:05.493
<i>That what you're looking for
has been here the whole time</i>

24:05.493 --> 24:08.199
<i>If you could see
that I'm the one</i>

24:08.199 --> 24:09.904
<i>Who understands you</i>

24:09.904 --> 24:15.745
<i>Been here all along
So, why can't you see?</i>

24:15.745 --> 24:21.377
<i>You belong with me</i>

24:24.723 --> 24:28.824
<i>Walk in the streets with you
in your worn-out jeans</i>

24:28.824 --> 24:32.520
<i>I can't help thinking
this is how it ought to be</i>

24:32.520 --> 24:36.359
<i>Laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself</i>

24:36.359 --> 24:39.329
<i>Hey, isn't this easy?</i>

24:39.329 --> 24:40.935
<i>And you've got a smile</i>

24:40.935 --> 24:43.498
<i>That can light up
this whole town</i>

24:43.498 --> 24:47.238
<i>I haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down</i>

24:47.238 --> 24:50.681
<i>You say you're fine
I know you better than that</i>

24:50.681 --> 24:53.882
<i>Hey, what you doing
with a girl like that?</i>

24:53.882 --> 24:57.952
<i>She wears high heels
I wear sneakers</i>

24:57.952 --> 25:01.285
<i>She's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers</i>

25:01.285 --> 25:04.695
<i>Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find</i>

25:04.695 --> 25:08.292
<i>That what you're looking for
has been here the whole time</i>

25:08.292 --> 25:11.130
<i>If you could see
that I'm the one</i>

25:11.130 --> 25:12.703
<i>Who understands you</i>

25:12.703 --> 25:18.709
<i>Been here all along
So, why can't you see?</i>

25:18.709 --> 25:23.615
<i>You belong with me</i>

25:23.615 --> 25:27.311
<i>Standing by
and waiting at your back door</i>

25:27.311 --> 25:28.785
<i>All this time</i>

25:28.785 --> 25:33.449
<i>How could
you not know, baby?</i>

25:33.449 --> 25:38.795
<i>You belong with me</i>

25:51.304 --> 25:54.745
<i>Oh, I remember you
driving to my house</i>

25:54.745 --> 25:56.571
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

25:56.571 --> 25:58.309
<i>I'm the one
who makes you laugh</i>

25:58.309 --> 26:00.410
<i>When you know
you're 'bout to cry</i>

26:00.410 --> 26:02.115
<i>I know your favorite songs</i>

26:02.115 --> 26:03.655
<i>And you tell me
'bout your dreams</i>

26:03.655 --> 26:05.789
<i>Think I know
where you belong</i>

26:05.789 --> 26:09.452
<i>Think I know it's with me</i>

26:09.452 --> 26:12.191
<i>Can't you see
that I'm the one</i>

26:12.191 --> 26:13.621
<i>Who understands you?</i>

26:13.621 --> 26:19.671
<i>Been here all along
So, why can't you see?</i>

26:19.671 --> 26:24.632
<i>You belong with me</i>

26:24.632 --> 26:28.438
<i>Standing by
and waiting at your back door</i>

26:28.438 --> 26:29.780
<i>All this time</i>

26:29.780 --> 26:34.213
<i>How could
you not know, baby?</i>

26:34.213 --> 26:39.889
<i>You belong with me</i>

26:41.761 --> 26:44.553
<i>You belong with me</i>

26:44.553 --> 26:49.393
<i>Have you ever thought
just maybe</i>

26:49.393 --> 26:54.563
<i>You belong with me</i>

27:27.730 --> 27:31.600
<i>We were both young
when I first saw you</i>

27:31.600 --> 27:35.076
<i>I close my eyes
and the flashback starts</i>

27:35.076 --> 27:36.781
<i>I'm standin' there</i>

27:38.312 --> 27:41.885
<i>On a balcony in summer air</i>

27:44.054 --> 27:45.614
<i>See the lights</i>

27:45.614 --> 27:48.188
<i>See the party
The ball gowns</i>

27:48.188 --> 27:51.521
<i>See you make your way
through the crowd</i>

27:51.521 --> 27:54.062
<i>- And say, "Hello"</i>

27:55.395 --> 27:58.330
<i>Little did I know</i>

27:59.839 --> 28:03.808
<i>That you were Romeo
You were throwin' pebbles</i>

28:03.808 --> 28:07.306
<i>And my daddy said
"Stay away from Juliet"</i>

28:07.306 --> 28:10.309
<i>And I was cryin'
on the staircase</i>

28:10.309 --> 28:14.247
<i>Beggin' you
"Please don't go"</i>

28:14.920 --> 28:16.249
<i>And I said</i>

28:16.249 --> 28:20.286
<i>Romeo, take me
somewhere we can be alone</i>

28:20.286 --> 28:22.486
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

28:22.486 --> 28:24.488
<i>All there's left to do
is run</i>

28:24.488 --> 28:28.459
<i>You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess</i>

28:28.459 --> 28:33.101
<i>It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

28:36.007 --> 28:40.471
<i>So I sneak out
to the garden to see you</i>

28:40.471 --> 28:42.110
<i>We keep quiet</i>

28:42.110 --> 28:43.815
<i>'Cause we're dead
if they knew</i>

28:43.815 --> 28:45.641
<i>So close your eyes</i>

28:46.886 --> 28:52.186
<i>Escape this town
for a little while, oh oh</i>

28:52.186 --> 28:56.190
<i>'Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter</i>

28:56.190 --> 28:59.930
<i>And my daddy said
"Stay away from Juliet"</i>

28:59.930 --> 29:02.262
<i>But you were everything
to me</i>

29:02.262 --> 29:06.728
<i>I was beggin' you
"Please don't go"</i>

29:07.236 --> 29:08.840
<i>And I said</i>

29:08.840 --> 29:12.470
<i>Romeo, take me
somewhere we can be alone</i>

29:12.470 --> 29:14.769
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

29:14.769 --> 29:16.540
<i>All there's left to do
is run</i>

29:16.540 --> 29:20.984
<i>You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess</i>

29:20.984 --> 29:25.054
<i>It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

29:25.054 --> 29:26.957
<i>Romeo, save me</i>

29:26.957 --> 29:29.157
<i>They're tryna tell me
how to feel</i>

29:29.157 --> 29:32.996
<i>This love is difficult
But it's real</i>

29:32.996 --> 29:34.492
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

29:34.492 --> 29:37.066
<i>We'll make it
out of this mess</i>

29:37.066 --> 29:41.499
<i>It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>

29:44.339 --> 29:46.911
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

29:56.219 --> 29:58.923
<i>I got tired of waiting</i>

30:00.223 --> 30:03.994
<i>Wonderin' if you were
ever comin' around</i>

30:03.994 --> 30:08.724
<i>My faith in you was fading</i>

30:08.724 --> 30:12.002
<i>When I met you
on the outskirts of town</i>

30:12.002 --> 30:13.366
<i>And I said</i>

30:13.366 --> 30:17.370
<i>Romeo, save me
I've been feeling so alone</i>

30:17.370 --> 30:21.209
<i>I keep waiting for you
but you never come</i>

30:21.209 --> 30:24.872
<i>Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think</i>

30:24.872 --> 30:26.918
<i>He knelt to the ground</i>

30:26.918 --> 30:29.580
<i>And pulled out a ring
And said</i>

30:29.580 --> 30:31.219
<i>"Marry me, Juliet</i>

30:31.219 --> 30:33.452
<i>"You'll never
have to be alone</i>

30:33.452 --> 30:37.258
<i>"I love you
and that's all I really know</i>

30:37.258 --> 30:41.592
<i>"I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress</i>

30:41.592 --> 30:48.005
<i>"It's a love story
Baby, just say, 'Yes'"</i>

30:48.766 --> 30:51.569
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

30:52.407 --> 30:55.672
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

30:57.445 --> 31:04.318
<i>'Cause we were both young
when I first saw you</i>

31:48.034 --> 31:52.630
<i>Wait for the signal</i>

31:52.630 --> 31:59.340
<i>And I'll meet you
after dark</i>

32:13.356 --> 32:14.553
<i>I'm like the water</i>

32:14.553 --> 32:17.061
<i>When your ship
rolled in that night</i>

32:18.988 --> 32:20.196
<i>Rough on the surface</i>

32:20.196 --> 32:23.034
<i>But you cut through
like a knife</i>

32:25.269 --> 32:28.138
<i>And if it was
an open-shut case</i>

32:28.138 --> 32:30.899
<i>I never would've known
from the look on your face</i>

32:30.899 --> 32:34.903
<i>Lost in your current
like a priceless wine</i>

32:36.709 --> 32:39.413
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

32:39.413 --> 32:42.383
<i>Wherever you stray
I follow</i>

32:42.383 --> 32:45.386
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

32:45.386 --> 32:48.884
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

32:48.884 --> 32:50.094
<i>Life was a willow</i>

32:50.094 --> 32:52.492
<i>And it bent
right to your wind</i>

32:52.492 --> 32:54.692
<i>Oh</i>

32:54.692 --> 32:58.927
<i>Head on the pillow
I could feel you sneaking in</i>

33:00.964 --> 33:03.569
<i>As if you were
a mythical thing</i>

33:03.569 --> 33:06.737
<i>Like you were a trophy
or a champion ring</i>

33:06.737 --> 33:10.213
<i>And there was one prize
I'd cheat to win</i>

33:12.217 --> 33:15.284
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

33:15.284 --> 33:18.188
<i>Wherever you stray
I follow</i>

33:18.188 --> 33:20.949
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

33:20.949 --> 33:24.128
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

33:24.128 --> 33:27.054
<i>You know that my train
could take you home</i>

33:27.054 --> 33:29.430
<i>Anywhere else is hollow</i>

33:29.430 --> 33:32.532
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

33:32.532 --> 33:35.964
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

33:38.936 --> 33:40.210
<i>Life was a willow</i>

33:40.210 --> 33:42.740
<i>And it bent
right to your wind</i>

33:42.740 --> 33:45.116
<i>Oh</i>

33:45.116 --> 33:48.152
<i>They count me out
time and time again</i>

33:50.585 --> 33:51.749
<i>Life was a willow</i>

33:51.749 --> 33:54.158
<i>And it bent
right to your wind</i>

33:54.158 --> 33:56.490
<i>Oh</i>

33:56.490 --> 33:59.955
<i>But I come back stronger
than a '90s trend</i>

34:26.357 --> 34:27.488
<i>Wait for the signal</i>

34:27.488 --> 34:30.018
<i>And I'll meet you
after dark</i>

34:31.692 --> 34:36.464
<i>Show me the places where
the others gave you scars</i>

34:38.336 --> 34:40.996
<i>Now this is
an open-shut case</i>

34:40.996 --> 34:44.032
<i>Guess I should've known
from the look on your face</i>

34:44.032 --> 34:47.640
<i>Every bait and switch
was a work of art</i>

34:49.677 --> 34:52.513
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

34:52.513 --> 34:55.450
<i>Wherever you stray
I follow</i>

34:55.450 --> 34:58.321
<i>Begging for you
to take my hand</i>

34:58.321 --> 35:01.148
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

35:01.148 --> 35:04.052
<i>You know that my train
could take you home</i>

35:04.052 --> 35:07.121
<i>Anywhere else is hollow</i>

35:07.121 --> 35:09.794
<i>Begging for you
to take my hand</i>

35:09.794 --> 35:12.665
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

35:12.665 --> 35:15.404
<i>The more that you say
The less I know</i>

35:15.404 --> 35:18.308
<i>Wherever you stray
I follow</i>

35:18.308 --> 35:21.212
<i>Begging for you
to take my hand</i>

35:21.212 --> 35:24.006
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

35:24.006 --> 35:26.877
<i>You know that my train
could take you home</i>

35:26.877 --> 35:29.847
<i>Anywhere else is hollow</i>

35:29.847 --> 35:32.850
<i>Begging for you
to take my hand</i>

35:32.850 --> 35:35.622
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

35:36.625 --> 35:38.295
<i>Hey, that's my man</i>

35:39.595 --> 35:41.122
<i>That's my man</i>

35:42.466 --> 35:44.026
<i>Yeah, that's my man</i>

35:44.026 --> 35:46.699
<i>Every bait and switch
was a work of art</i>

35:46.699 --> 35:48.569
<i>That's my man</i>

35:49.473 --> 35:51.374
<i>Hey, that's my man</i>

35:52.740 --> 35:55.609
<i>I'm begging for you
to take my hand</i>

35:55.609 --> 35:58.876
<i>Wreck my plans
That's my man</i>

36:14.993 --> 36:19.732
<i>Never be so kind
You forget to be clever</i>

36:25.102 --> 36:29.973
<i>Never be so clever
You forget to be kind</i>

36:35.112 --> 36:38.388
<i>And if I didn't know better</i>

36:38.388 --> 36:42.920
<i>I'd think you were
talking to me now</i>

36:45.331 --> 36:47.925
<i>If I didn't know better</i>

36:50.336 --> 36:53.271
<i>I'd think
you were still around</i>

36:55.198 --> 37:00.102
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

37:00.102 --> 37:05.074
<i>You're alive
You're alive in my head</i>

37:05.074 --> 37:10.178
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

37:10.178 --> 37:12.950
<i>You're alive, so alive</i>

37:14.657 --> 37:17.152
<i>The autumn chill
that wakes me up</i>

37:17.152 --> 37:19.363
<i>You loved the amber skies
so much</i>

37:19.363 --> 37:21.497
<i>Long limbs
and frozen swims</i>

37:21.497 --> 37:24.797
<i>You'd always go past
where our feet could touch</i>

37:24.797 --> 37:27.030
<i>And I complained
the whole way there</i>

37:27.030 --> 37:29.472
<i>The car ride back
and up the stairs</i>

37:29.472 --> 37:32.035
<i>I should've
asked you questions</i>

37:32.035 --> 37:35.775
<i>I should've
asked you how to be</i>

37:35.775 --> 37:38.140
<i>Asked you
to write it down for me</i>

37:38.140 --> 37:41.011
<i>Should've kept
every grocery store receipt</i>

37:41.011 --> 37:45.554
<i>'Cause every scrap of you
would be taken from me</i>

37:45.554 --> 37:48.183
<i>Watched as you signed
your name Marjorie</i>

37:48.183 --> 37:51.285
<i>All your closets
of backlogged dreams</i>

37:51.285 --> 37:55.157
<i>And how you left them all
to me</i>

37:55.157 --> 38:00.294
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

38:00.294 --> 38:05.299
<i>You're alive
You're alive in my head</i>

38:05.299 --> 38:10.172
<i>What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead</i>

38:10.172 --> 38:13.010
<i>You're alive, so alive</i>

38:15.179 --> 38:18.422
<i>And if I didn't
know better</i>

38:18.422 --> 38:22.921
<i>I'd think you were
singing to me now</i>

38:25.352 --> 38:28.091
<i>If I didn't know better</i>

38:30.436 --> 38:33.063
<i>I'd think
you were still around</i>

38:35.606 --> 38:38.508
<i>I know better</i>

38:38.508 --> 38:42.776
<i>But I still feel you
all around</i>

38:45.583 --> 38:47.781
<i>I know better</i>

38:50.082 --> 38:52.280
<i>But you're still around</i>

39:21.146 --> 39:25.115
<i>You know, this...
this tour,</i>

39:25.115 --> 39:26.457
<i>the fact that this is</i>

39:26.457 --> 39:29.823
<i>the last city
on the U.S. tour...</i>

39:29.823 --> 39:32.155
<i>It is...</i>

39:32.155 --> 39:35.059
<i>It is so, so many things
for me, because this has been</i>

39:35.059 --> 39:38.502
<i>the most extraordinary experience
of my entire life.</i>

39:38.502 --> 39:39.800
<i>Being on this tour,</i>

39:39.800 --> 39:42.000
<i>getting to share these moments
with you.</i>

39:45.234 --> 39:46.840
<i>I know you're supposed to,
like, play it cool.</i>

39:46.840 --> 39:48.105
<i>You're supposed to be like,</i>

39:48.105 --> 39:49.073
<i>"Oh, I like you guys
a little bit."</i>

39:49.073 --> 39:50.778
<i>But genuinely,</i>

39:50.778 --> 39:52.846
<i>this has meant more to me
than anything I've ever done</i>

39:52.846 --> 39:56.278
<i>or been a part of in my life.
This tour. So...</i>

40:05.190 --> 40:06.354
<i>Ah.</i>

40:06.354 --> 40:08.697
<i>And, you know,
before this tour,</i>

40:08.697 --> 40:10.457
<i>I would... I would go
through this process</i>

40:10.457 --> 40:12.030
<i>where I'd make an album,</i>

40:12.030 --> 40:14.131
<i>and I'd call the album
something like</i>

40:14.131 --> 40:17.508
Red <i>or</i> Speak Now <i>or</i> Fearless
<i>or, you know.</i>

40:17.508 --> 40:19.004
<i>And then I'd go,</i>

40:19.004 --> 40:21.644
<i>I'd put together a tour called
the name of that album, right?</i>

40:21.644 --> 40:24.438
<i>Like the</i> 1989 <i>tour,</i>
Speak Now <i>tour.</i>

40:24.438 --> 40:26.209
<i>And we'd do it like that.</i>

40:26.209 --> 40:28.310
<i>And I remember like,</i>

40:28.310 --> 40:31.885
<i>why am I just do...
What is this...?</i>

40:31.885 --> 40:34.789
<i>- Why?</i>

40:34.789 --> 40:37.990
<i>Anyway, um,
so with this tour,</i>

40:37.990 --> 40:39.992
<i>I remember people
would come up to me</i>

40:39.992 --> 40:42.060
<i>and they'd be like,
"So you've put out,
like, five albums</i>

40:42.060 --> 40:43.798
<i>"that you haven't
done tours for.</i>

40:43.798 --> 40:45.360
<i>"So what's your plan? Like,
what are you going to do?</i>

40:45.360 --> 40:47.703
<i>"You're going to just,
like, do a show</i>

40:47.703 --> 40:49.969
<i>"with, like,
all the albums in it</i>

40:49.969 --> 40:51.399
<i>"and it'll be like, what?</i>

40:51.399 --> 40:53.401
<i>"Like, a three-and-a-half
hour long show?"</i>

41:02.918 --> 41:04.720
<i>And I was like,
"Yeah, it's...</i>

41:04.720 --> 41:07.558
<i>"it's going to be called
The Eras Tour.
See you there."</i>

41:12.895 --> 41:19.031
<i>So we are currently
in the</i> evermore <i>Era and, um...</i>

41:22.641 --> 41:25.235
<i>and that was my second
pandemic album that I made.</i>

41:25.235 --> 41:30.680
<i>And I remember there was...
There was one specific song</i>

41:30.680 --> 41:33.848
<i>where after I wrote it
I thought, you know,</i>

41:33.848 --> 41:36.752
<i>that would be
a really cathartic experience,</i>

41:36.752 --> 41:40.019
<i>I'm sure, to get
to sing</i> Champagne Problems

41:40.019 --> 41:42.153
<i>- in a stadium, you know?</i>

41:45.730 --> 41:46.762
<i>So let's do it.</i>

42:08.115 --> 42:12.216
<i>You booked the night train
for a reason</i>

42:12.216 --> 42:16.451
<i>So you could sit there
in this hurt</i>

42:19.192 --> 42:23.425
<i>Bustling crowds
or silent sleepers</i>

42:23.425 --> 42:28.265
<i>You're not sure
which is worse</i>

42:28.265 --> 42:32.467
<i>Because I dropped your hand
while dancing</i>

42:32.467 --> 42:37.274
<i>Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing</i>

42:37.274 --> 42:39.980
<i>Champagne problems</i>

42:39.980 --> 42:42.950
<i>Your mom's ring
in your pocket</i>

42:42.950 --> 42:45.689
<i>My picture in your wallet</i>

42:45.689 --> 42:48.186
<i>Your heart was glass
I dropped it</i>

42:48.186 --> 42:50.991
<i>Champagne problems</i>

43:02.400 --> 43:05.676
<i>You told your family
for a reason</i>

43:07.141 --> 43:10.648
<i>You couldn't keep it in</i>

43:13.213 --> 43:16.753
<i>Your sister splashed out
on the bottle</i>

43:17.646 --> 43:22.517
<i>Now no one's celebrating</i>

43:23.388 --> 43:26.455
<i>Dom Pérignon, you brought it</i>

43:26.455 --> 43:28.963
<i>No crowd of friends applauded</i>

43:28.963 --> 43:31.328
<i>Your hometown skeptics
called it</i>

43:31.328 --> 43:34.529
<i>Champagne problems</i>

43:34.529 --> 43:37.301
<i>You had a speech
You're speechless</i>

43:37.301 --> 43:39.743
<i>Love slipped
beyond your reaches</i>

43:39.743 --> 43:42.240
<i>And I couldn't
give a reason</i>

43:42.240 --> 43:44.671
<i>Champagne problems</i>

44:07.300 --> 44:09.773
<i>Your Midas touch
on the Chevy door</i>

44:09.773 --> 44:12.501
<i>November flush
and your flannel cure</i>

44:12.501 --> 44:14.701
<i>"This dorm was
once a madhouse"</i>

44:14.701 --> 44:17.242
<i>I made a joke
"Well, it's made for me"</i>

44:17.242 --> 44:20.575
<i>How evergreen
Our group of friends</i>

44:20.575 --> 44:23.248
<i>Don't think
we'll say that word again</i>

44:23.248 --> 44:26.757
<i>And soon they'll have
the nerve to deck the halls</i>

44:26.757 --> 44:28.253
<i>That we once walked through</i>

44:28.253 --> 44:30.893
<i>One for the money
Two for the show</i>

44:30.893 --> 44:33.390
<i>I never was ready
so I watch you go</i>

44:33.390 --> 44:35.964
<i>Sometimes you just
don't know the answer</i>

44:35.964 --> 44:38.934
<i>Till someone's
on their knees and asks you</i>

44:38.934 --> 44:41.629
<i>"She would've made
such a lovely bride</i>

44:41.629 --> 44:44.302
<i>"What a shame she's fucked
in the head," they said</i>

44:44.302 --> 44:46.810
<i>But you'll find
the real thing instead</i>

44:46.810 --> 44:49.978
<i>She'll patch up
your tapestry that I shred</i>

44:49.978 --> 44:53.245
<i>And hold your hand
while dancing</i>

44:53.245 --> 44:58.382
<i>Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing</i>

44:58.382 --> 45:01.055
<i>With champagne problems</i>

45:01.055 --> 45:03.893
<i>Your mom's ring
in your pocket</i>

45:03.893 --> 45:06.555
<i>Her picture in your wallet</i>

45:06.555 --> 45:12.033
<i>You won't remember all my
Champagne problems</i>

45:17.843 --> 45:22.978
<i>You won't remember all my
Champagne problems</i>

46:47.262 --> 46:49.526
<i>That's a very generous thing
to do for somebody.</i>

46:49.526 --> 46:51.902
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

46:51.902 --> 46:52.969
<i>Ah.</i>

48:33.962 --> 48:40.142
<i>I sit and watch you
reading with your head low</i>

48:41.904 --> 48:43.937
<i>I wake and watch you</i>

48:43.937 --> 48:48.513
<i>Breathing with your eyes closed</i>

48:49.879 --> 48:53.155
<i>I sit and watch you</i>

48:53.155 --> 48:59.029
<i>I notice everything
you do or don't do</i>

48:59.029 --> 49:03.990
<i>You're so much older
and wiser and I</i>

49:03.990 --> 49:08.863
<i>I wait by the door
like I'm just a kid</i>

49:10.174 --> 49:13.406
<i>Use my best colors
for your portrait</i>

49:14.838 --> 49:18.048
<i>Lay the table
with the fancy shit</i>

49:18.941 --> 49:22.745
<i>And watch you tolerate it</i>

49:22.745 --> 49:25.418
<i>If it's all in my head
Tell me now</i>

49:26.784 --> 49:30.588
<i>Tell me
I've got it wrong somehow</i>

49:30.588 --> 49:35.021
<i>I know my love
should be celebrated</i>

49:35.021 --> 49:38.497
<i>But you tolerate it</i>

49:38.497 --> 49:42.028
<i>While you were out building
other worlds, where was I?</i>

49:42.028 --> 49:43.436
<i>Where's that man</i>

49:43.436 --> 49:46.373
<i>Who'd throw blankets
over my barbed wire?</i>

49:46.373 --> 49:50.773
<i>I made you my temple
My mural, my sky</i>

49:50.773 --> 49:52.775
<i>Now I'm begging
for footnotes</i>

49:52.775 --> 49:54.876
<i>In the story of your life</i>

49:54.876 --> 49:57.945
<i>Drawing hearts
in the byline</i>

49:57.945 --> 50:02.257
<i>Always taking up
too much space or time</i>

50:02.257 --> 50:07.394
<i>You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I</i>

50:10.630 --> 50:14.137
<i>Break free
and leave us in ruins</i>

50:14.137 --> 50:17.437
<i>Took this dagger in me
and removed it</i>

50:19.067 --> 50:23.146
<i>Gain the weight of you
Then lose it</i>

50:23.146 --> 50:27.040
<i>Believe me, I could do it</i>

50:27.040 --> 50:29.746
<i>If it's all in my head
Tell me now</i>

50:30.848 --> 50:34.817
<i>Tell me
I've got it wrong somehow</i>

50:34.817 --> 50:39.052
<i>I know my love
should be celebrated</i>

50:39.052 --> 50:42.528
<i>But you tolerate it</i>

50:55.774 --> 50:59.743
<i>I sit and watch you</i>

51:46.693 --> 51:49.694
<i>Knew he was a killer
first time that I saw him</i>

51:49.694 --> 51:50.893
<i>Wondered how many girls</i>

51:50.893 --> 51:52.796
<i>He had loved
and left haunted</i>

51:52.796 --> 51:55.832
<i>But if he's a ghost
Then I can be a phantom</i>

51:55.832 --> 51:58.307
<i>Holdin' him
for ransom, some</i>

51:58.307 --> 52:00.067
<i>Some boys
are tryin' too hard</i>

52:00.067 --> 52:01.475
<i>He don't try at all though</i>

52:01.475 --> 52:02.674
<i>Younger than my exes</i>

52:02.674 --> 52:04.676
<i>But he act
like such a man, so</i>

52:04.676 --> 52:06.007
<i>I see nothing better</i>

52:06.007 --> 52:10.143
<i>I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta</i>

52:10.143 --> 52:13.718
<i>I, I, I see
how this is gon' go</i>

52:13.718 --> 52:16.226
<i>Touch me
and you'll never be alone</i>

52:16.226 --> 52:19.394
<i>I-Island breeze
and lights down low</i>

52:19.394 --> 52:21.297
<i>No one has to know</i>

52:22.465 --> 52:25.961
<i>In the middle of the night
In my dreams</i>

52:27.569 --> 52:31.868
<i>You should see
the things we do, baby</i>

52:31.868 --> 52:33.870
<i>Mm</i>

52:33.870 --> 52:38.039
<i>In the middle of the night
In my dreams</i>

52:39.812 --> 52:46.256
<i>I know I'm gonna be
with you, so I take my time</i>

52:46.256 --> 52:47.389
<i>Are you ready for it?</i>

52:52.792 --> 52:55.529
<i>Knew I was a robber
first time that he saw me</i>

52:55.529 --> 52:56.959
<i>Stealing hearts
and running off</i>

52:56.959 --> 52:58.367
<i>And never sayin' sorry</i>

52:58.367 --> 52:59.797
<i>But if I'm a thief</i>

52:59.797 --> 53:01.601
<i>Then he can
join the heist, and</i>

53:01.601 --> 53:03.966
<i>We'll move
to an island, and</i>

53:03.966 --> 53:07.574
<i>And he can be my jailer
Burton to this Taylor</i>

53:07.574 --> 53:10.643
<i>Every love I've known
in comparison is a failure</i>

53:10.643 --> 53:13.910
<i>I forget their names now
I'm so very tame now</i>

53:13.910 --> 53:16.242
<i>Never be the same now, now</i>

53:16.242 --> 53:19.784
<i>I, I, I see
how this is gon' go</i>

53:19.784 --> 53:22.083

the things we do, baby</i>

53:38.066 --> 53:40.134

53:58.319 --> 53:59.824
<i>Are you ready for it?</i>

53:59.824 --> 54:03.190
<i>Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin</i>

54:03.190 --> 54:05.467

<i>Dive bar on the East Side
Where you at?</i>

55:47.294 --> 55:49.637
<i>Phone lights up
my nightstand in the black</i>

55:49.637 --> 55:52.332
<i>Come here
You can meet me in the back</i>

55:54.611 --> 55:57.271
<i>Dark jeans and your Nikes
Look at you</i>

55:57.271 --> 55:59.812
<i>Oh, damn
Never seen that color blue</i>

55:59.812 --> 56:02.452

dreaming of me?</i>

58:16.542 --> 58:21.756

Every time you're loving me</i>

01:02:04.913 --> 01:02:06.673
<i>You're loving me</i>

01:02:06.673 --> 01:02:10.413
<i>Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby</i>

01:02:10.413 --> 01:02:13.823
<i>I'll be using
for the rest of my life</i>

01:02:14.782 --> 01:02:18.289
<i>Don't blame me
Don't blame me</i>

01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:21.490
<i>Don't blame me
for what you made me do</i>

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.362
<i>Don't blame me
Don't blame me</i>

01:02:25.362 --> 01:02:31.434
<i>Don't blame me
for what you made me do</i>

01:02:52.754 --> 01:02:57.196
<i>I don't like your little games</i>

01:02:57.196 --> 01:03:01.134
<i>Don't like your tilted stage</i>

01:03:01.134 --> 01:03:04.632
<i>The role you made me play</i>

01:03:04.632 --> 01:03:07.668
<i>Of the fool
No, I don't like you</i>

01:03:07.668 --> 01:03:12.244
<i>I don't like
your perfect crime</i>

01:03:12.244 --> 01:03:15.918
<i>How you laugh when you lie</i>

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:19.581
<i>You said the gun was mine</i>

01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:22.848
<i>Isn't cool
No, I don't like you</i>

01:03:22.848 --> 01:03:24.091
<i>But I got smarter</i>

01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:26.588
<i>I got harder
in the nick of time</i>

01:03:26.588 --> 01:03:28.590
<i>Honey, I rose up
from the dead</i>

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.229
<i>I do it all the time</i>

01:03:30.229 --> 01:03:32.099
<i>I've got a list of names</i>

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:34.662
<i>And yours is in red Underlined</i>

01:03:34.662 --> 01:03:37.863
<i>I check it once
Then I check it twice, oh!</i>

01:03:37.863 --> 01:03:40.338
<i>Ooh, look what
you made me do</i>

01:03:40.338 --> 01:03:41.867
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:03:41.867 --> 01:03:43.770
<i>Look what you just made me do</i>

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:45.442
<i>Look what you just made me</i>

01:03:45.442 --> 01:03:47.873
<i>Ooh, look what you made me do</i>

01:03:47.873 --> 01:03:49.710
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:52.779
<i>Look what
you just made me do</i>

01:03:52.779 --> 01:03:57.190
<i>I don't like
your kingdom keys</i>

01:03:57.190 --> 01:04:01.293
<i>They once belonged to me</i>

01:04:01.293 --> 01:04:04.593
<i>You asked me
for a place to sleep</i>

01:04:04.593 --> 01:04:07.299
<i>Locked me out
and threw a feast</i>

01:04:07.299 --> 01:04:09.037
<i>- What?
- The world moves on</i>

01:04:09.037 --> 01:04:11.732
<i>Another day
Another drama, drama</i>

01:04:11.732 --> 01:04:15.538
<i>But not for me, not for me
All I think about is karma</i>

01:04:15.538 --> 01:04:16.946
<i>And then the world moves on</i>

01:04:16.946 --> 01:04:19.278
<i>But one thing's for sure</i>

01:04:19.278 --> 01:04:23.051
<i>Maybe I got mine
But you'll all get yours</i>

01:04:23.051 --> 01:04:24.283
<i>But I got smarter</i>

01:04:24.283 --> 01:04:26.648
<i>I got harder
in the nick of time</i>

01:04:26.648 --> 01:04:28.716
<i>Honey, I rose up
from the dead</i>

01:04:28.716 --> 01:04:30.388
<i>I do it all the time</i>

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:32.093
<i>I've got a list of names</i>

01:04:32.093 --> 01:04:34.623
<i>And yours is in red Underlined</i>

01:04:34.623 --> 01:04:37.967
<i>I check it once
Then I check it twice, oh!</i>

01:04:37.967 --> 01:04:40.233
<i>Ooh, look what you made me do</i>

01:04:40.233 --> 01:04:42.268
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:04:42.268 --> 01:04:43.929

01:04:43.929 --> 01:04:45.238
<i>Look what you just made me</i>

01:04:45.238 --> 01:04:48.010
<i>Ooh, look what you made me do</i>

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.803
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:52.905
<i>Look what you just made me do</i>

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:56.843
<i>I don't trust nobody
and nobody trusts me</i>

01:04:56.843 --> 01:05:00.154
<i>I'll be the actress
starring in your bad dreams</i>

01:05:00.154 --> 01:05:04.422
<i>I don't trust nobody
and nobody trusts me</i>

01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:07.821
<i>I'll be the actress
starring in your bad dreams</i>

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:11.858
<i>I don't trust nobody

01:05:11.858 --> 01:05:15.367
<i>I'll be the actress
starring in your bad dreams</i>

01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:19.107
<i>I don't trust nobody
and nobody trusts me</i>

01:05:19.107 --> 01:05:22.979
<i>I'll be the actress
starring in your bad dreams</i>

01:05:28.844 --> 01:05:30.514
<i>"I'm sorry</i>

01:05:30.514 --> 01:05:32.813
<i>"But the old Taylor can't
come to the phone right now"</i>

01:05:33.189 --> 01:05:34.188
<i>"Why?"</i>

01:05:34.817 --> 01:05:36.487
<i>"Oh</i>

01:05:36.487 --> 01:05:37.950
<i>-"'Cause she's dead!"
- Oh!</i>

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.524
<i>Ooh, look what
you made me do</i>

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:42.361
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:05:42.361 --> 01:05:44.033
<i>Look what
you just made me do</i>

01:05:44.033 --> 01:05:45.463
<i>Look what you just made me</i>

01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:47.960
<i>Ooh, look what
you made me do</i>

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.896
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:05:49.896 --> 01:05:51.535
<i>Look what
you just made me do</i>

01:05:51.535 --> 01:05:52.965
<i>Look what you just made me</i>

01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:55.209
<i>Ooh, look what
you made me do</i>

01:05:55.209 --> 01:05:57.376
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:05:57.376 --> 01:05:59.048
<i>Look what
you just made me do</i>

01:05:59.048 --> 01:06:00.346
<i>Look what you just made me</i>

01:06:00.346 --> 01:06:02.843
<i>Ooh, look what
you made me do</i>

01:06:02.843 --> 01:06:04.746
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:06:04.746 --> 01:06:06.484
<i>Look what
you just made me do</i>

01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:08.849
<i>Look what you made me do</i>

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:57.535
<i>There I was again tonight</i>

01:06:57.535 --> 01:07:00.373
<i>Forcing laughter
Faking smiles</i>

01:07:00.373 --> 01:07:03.904
<i>Same old tired, lonely place</i>

01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:09.041
<i>Walls of insincerity</i>

01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.978
<i>Shifting eyes and vacancy</i>

01:07:11.978 --> 01:07:15.421
<i>Vanished when I saw your face</i>

01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:18.985
<i>All I can say is it was</i>

01:07:18.985 --> 01:07:25.860
<i>Enchanting to meet you</i>

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:32.504
<i>Your eyes whispered
"Have we met?"</i>

01:07:32.504 --> 01:07:35.342
<i>Across the room
Your silhouette</i>

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:39.038
<i>Starts to make its way to me</i>

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:44.010
<i>The playful
conversation starts</i>

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:46.980
<i>Counter all
your quick remarks</i>

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:51.292
<i>Like passing notes
in secrecy</i>

01:07:51.987 --> 01:07:54.119
<i>And it was</i>

01:07:54.119 --> 01:08:00.697
<i>Enchanting to meet you</i>

01:08:02.206 --> 01:08:05.867
<i>All I can say is I was</i>

01:08:05.867 --> 01:08:12.907
<i>Enchanted to meet you</i>

01:08:17.177 --> 01:08:23.049
<i>This night is sparklin'
Don't you let it go</i>

01:08:23.049 --> 01:08:28.857
<i>I'm wonderstruck
Blushin' all the way home</i>

01:08:28.857 --> 01:08:34.632
<i>I'll spend forever
wonderin' if you knew</i>

01:08:34.632 --> 01:08:41.672
<i>I was enchanted to meet you</i>

01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:03.826
<i>This is me praying that</i>

01:09:03.826 --> 01:09:06.334
<i>This was the very first page</i>

01:09:06.334 --> 01:09:09.865
<i>Not where the storyline ends</i>

01:09:09.865 --> 01:09:12.274
<i>My thoughts
will echo your name</i>

01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:15.244
<i>Until I see you again</i>

01:09:15.244 --> 01:09:18.247
<i>These are the words
I held back</i>

01:09:18.247 --> 01:09:21.283
<i>As I was leaving too soon</i>

01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:26.849
<i>I was enchanted
to meet you</i>

01:09:26.849 --> 01:09:32.756
<i>Please, don't be in love
with someone else</i>

01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:38.432
<i>Please, don't have
somebody waiting on you</i>

01:09:38.432 --> 01:09:44.306
<i>Please, don't be in love
with someone else</i>

01:09:44.306 --> 01:09:51.038
<i>Please, don't have
somebody waiting on you</i>

01:09:51.038 --> 01:09:56.714
<i>This night is sparklin'
Don't you let it go</i>

01:09:56.714 --> 01:10:02.819
<i>I'm wonderstruck
Blushin' all the way home</i>

01:10:02.819 --> 01:10:06.251
<i>I'll spend forever</i>

01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:11.498
<i>Wonderin' if you knew</i>

01:10:14.371 --> 01:10:20.265
<i>This night is flawless
Don't you let it go</i>

01:10:20.265 --> 01:10:26.139
<i>I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone</i>

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:31.683
<i>I'll spend forever
wonderin' if you knew</i>

01:10:31.683 --> 01:10:37.249
<i>I was enchanted to meet you</i>

01:10:37.249 --> 01:10:39.757
<i>Please, don't be in love</i>

01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:42.958
<i>With someone else</i>

01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:48.997
<i>Please, don't have
somebody waiting on you</i>

01:11:11.857 --> 01:11:14.363
<i>It feels like
a perfect night</i>

01:11:14.363 --> 01:11:16.398
<i>To dress up like hipsters</i>

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:18.961
<i>And make fun of our exes</i>

01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:21.194
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:23.702
<i>It feels like
a perfect night</i>

01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:25.704
<i>For breakfast at midnight</i>

01:11:25.704 --> 01:11:28.575
<i>To fall in love with strangers</i>

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:30.478
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

01:11:30.478 --> 01:11:32.513
<i>Yeah</i>

01:11:32.513 --> 01:11:34.548
<i>We're happy, free
Confused and lonely</i>

01:11:34.548 --> 01:11:36.715
<i>At the same time</i>

01:11:36.715 --> 01:11:39.047
<i>It's miserable and magical</i>

01:11:39.047 --> 01:11:41.313
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:11:41.313 --> 01:11:42.754
<i>Tonight's the night</i>

01:11:42.754 --> 01:11:45.526
<i>When we forget
about the deadlines</i>

01:11:45.526 --> 01:11:48.089
<i>It's time</i>

01:11:48.089 --> 01:11:49.497
<i>Ah, ah</i>

01:11:49.497 --> 01:11:51.026
<i>I don't know about you</i>

01:11:51.026 --> 01:11:53.897
<i>But I'm feeling 22</i>

01:11:53.897 --> 01:11:56.163
<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

01:11:56.163 --> 01:11:59.067
<i>You keep me next to you</i>

01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:00.541
<i>You don't know about me</i>

01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:03.104
<i>But I'll bet you want to</i>

01:12:03.104 --> 01:12:05.414
<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

01:12:05.414 --> 01:12:08.417
<i>We just keep dancing
like we're</i>

01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:11.783
<i>22</i>

01:12:12.984 --> 01:12:16.425
<i>22</i>

01:12:16.425 --> 01:12:18.856
<i>It feels like
one of those nights</i>

01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:21.122
<i>This place is too crowded</i>

01:12:21.122 --> 01:12:23.289
<i>Too many cool kids</i>

01:12:23.289 --> 01:12:25.467
<i>"Who is Taylor Swift
anyway? Ew"</i>

01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:28.569
<i>It seems like
one of those nights</i>

01:12:28.569 --> 01:12:30.604
<i>We ditch the whole scene</i>

01:12:30.604 --> 01:12:34.872
<i>And end up dreaming
instead of sleeping</i>

01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:36.808
<i>Yeah</i>

01:12:36.808 --> 01:12:39.371
<i>We're happy, free
Confused and lonely</i>

01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:41.813
<i>In the best way</i>

01:12:41.813 --> 01:12:43.782
<i>It's miserable and magical</i>

01:12:43.782 --> 01:12:46.081
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:47.379
<i>Tonight's the night</i>

01:12:47.379 --> 01:12:50.250
<i>When we forget
about the heartbreaks</i>

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.318
<i>It's time</i>

01:12:52.318 --> 01:12:53.792
<i>Ah, ah</i>

01:12:53.792 --> 01:12:55.596
<i>Hey!
- I don't know about you</i>

01:12:55.596 --> 01:12:58.423
<i>But I'm feeling 22</i>

01:12:58.423 --> 01:13:00.634
<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

01:13:00.634 --> 01:13:03.571
<i>You keep me next to you</i>

01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:04.935
<i>You don't know about me</i>

01:13:04.935 --> 01:13:07.674

<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:12.976
<i>We just keep dancing
like we're</i>

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:15.682
<i>22</i>

01:13:17.719 --> 01:13:21.149

01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:37.638
<i>It feels
like one of those nights</i>

01:13:37.638 --> 01:13:39.673
<i>We won't be sleeping</i>

01:13:39.673 --> 01:13:42.137
<i>It feels like
one of those nights</i>

01:13:42.137 --> 01:13:44.337
<i>You look like bad news</i>

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:49.584
<i>I gotta have you</i>

01:13:51.049 --> 01:13:53.522
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

01:13:53.522 --> 01:13:55.821
<i>Oh, oh</i>

01:13:55.821 --> 01:13:58.989

Yeah, yeah</i>

01:14:11.034 --> 01:14:12.497
<i>But I'll bet you want to</i>

01:14:12.497 --> 01:14:14.807
<i>Everything will be all right if</i>

01:14:14.807 --> 01:14:17.106
<i>We just keep dancing
like we're</i>

01:14:17.878 --> 01:14:20.780
<i>22</i>

01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:25.752
<i>22</i>

01:14:26.953 --> 01:14:30.416
<i>22</i>

01:14:31.628 --> 01:14:35.190
<i>22</i>

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.995
<i>It feels like
one of those nights</i>

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:39.766
<i>We ditch the whole scene</i>

01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:42.197
<i>It feels
like one of those nights</i>

01:14:42.197 --> 01:14:44.738
<i>We won't be sleeping</i>

01:14:44.738 --> 01:14:47.004
<i>It feels like
one of those nights</i>

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:49.204
<i>You look like bad news</i>

01:14:49.204 --> 01:14:54.341
<i>I gotta have you</i>

01:15:04.826 --> 01:15:07.354
<i>I remember when we broke up
the first time</i>

01:15:07.354 --> 01:15:09.224
<i>Saying, "This is it
I've had enough"</i>

01:15:09.224 --> 01:15:10.555
<i>'Cause like</i>

01:15:10.555 --> 01:15:12.425
<i>We hadn't seen each other
in a month</i>

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:15.901
<i>When you said
you needed space, what?</i>

01:15:15.901 --> 01:15:18.266
<i>Then you come around again
and say</i>

01:15:18.266 --> 01:15:20.532
<i>"Baby, I miss you
and I swear I'm gonna change</i>

01:15:20.532 --> 01:15:21.808
<i>"Trust me"</i>

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:23.568
<i>Remember how that lasted
for a day?</i>

01:15:23.568 --> 01:15:25.647
<i>I say, "I hate you"
We break up</i>

01:15:25.647 --> 01:15:27.308
<i>You call me, "I love you"</i>

01:15:27.308 --> 01:15:29.948
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:15:29.948 --> 01:15:32.819
<i>We called it off again
last night but</i>

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:35.580
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.088
<i>This time I'm telling you
I'm telling you</i>

01:15:38.088 --> 01:15:49.396
<i>We are never ever ever
getting back together</i>

01:15:49.396 --> 01:15:51.563
<i>You go talk to your friends</i>

01:15:51.563 --> 01:15:54.676
<i>Talk to my friends, talk to me</i>

01:15:54.676 --> 01:16:01.342
<i>But we are never ever ever
ever getting back together</i>

01:16:02.818 --> 01:16:04.851
<i>Like, ever</i>

01:16:06.151 --> 01:16:07.920
<i>I'm really gonna miss you
picking fights</i>

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.121
<i>And me falling for it
Screaming that I'm right</i>

01:16:11.121 --> 01:16:13.794
<i>And you would hide away
and find your peace of mind</i>

01:16:13.794 --> 01:16:17.457
<i>With some indie record
that's much cooler than mine</i>

01:16:17.457 --> 01:16:20.163
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:16:20.163 --> 01:16:23.001
<i>You called me up again
tonight but</i>

01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:25.707
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:16:25.707 --> 01:16:28.534
<i>This time, I'm telling you
I'm telling you</i>

01:16:28.534 --> 01:16:39.688
<i>We are never ever ever
getting back together</i>

01:16:39.688 --> 01:16:41.822
<i>You go talk
to your friends</i>

01:16:41.822 --> 01:16:44.121
<i>Talk to my friends
Talk to me</i>

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:45.793
<i>You talk to me</i>

01:16:45.793 --> 01:16:52.030
<i>But we are never ever ever
ever getting back together</i>

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:53.834
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
- Yeah</i>

01:16:53.834 --> 01:16:56.034
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:16:56.034 --> 01:16:58.707
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.238
<i>Oh, no</i>

01:17:02.238 --> 01:17:07.243
<i>I used to think
that we were forever ever</i>

01:17:07.243 --> 01:17:13.722
<i>And I used to say
never say never</i>

01:17:13.722 --> 01:17:14.987
<i>So he calls me up</i>

01:17:14.987 --> 01:17:16.153
<i>And he's like
"I still love you"</i>

01:17:16.153 --> 01:17:17.550
<i>And I'm like, I'm just</i>

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.486
<i>I mean this is exhausting
You know?</i>

01:17:19.486 --> 01:17:21.356
<i>Like, we are never
getting back together</i>

01:17:21.356 --> 01:17:23.358
<i>- Like, ever</i>

01:17:23.358 --> 01:17:25.393
<i>No</i>

01:17:25.393 --> 01:17:27.934
<i>We are never ever ever</i>

01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:29.694
<i>Getting back together</i>

01:17:29.694 --> 01:17:32.367
<i>We are never ever ever</i>

01:17:32.367 --> 01:17:35.271
<i>- Oh
- Getting back together</i>

01:17:35.271 --> 01:17:37.240
<i>You go talk to your friends</i>

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.342
<i>Talk to my friends
Talk to me</i>

01:17:40.342 --> 01:17:42.443
<i>But we are</i>

01:17:42.443 --> 01:17:47.514
<i>Never ever ever ever
getting back together</i>

01:17:47.514 --> 01:17:49.890
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.859
<i>- No
- Getting back together</i>

01:17:51.859 --> 01:17:53.223
<i>We</i>

01:17:53.223 --> 01:17:54.895
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:17:54.895 --> 01:17:57.557
<i>No, no</i>

01:17:57.557 --> 01:17:59.768
<i>You go talk to your friends</i>

01:17:59.768 --> 01:18:02.969
<i>Talk to my friends
talk to me</i>

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:09.701
<i>But we are never ever ever
ever getting back together</i>

01:18:19.746 --> 01:18:22.615
<i>Once upon a time
A few mistakes ago</i>

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:25.750
<i>I was in your sights
You got me alone</i>

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:31.800
<i>You found me, you found me
You found me</i>

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.100
<i>I guess you didn't care
and I guess I liked that</i>

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:38.301
<i>And when I fell hard
You took a step back</i>

01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:45.638
<i>Without me, without me
Without me</i>

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:52.249
<i>And he's long gone
when he's next to me</i>

01:18:52.249 --> 01:18:57.155
<i>And I realize
the blame is on me</i>

01:18:57.155 --> 01:19:01.423
<i>'Cause I knew you were
trouble when you walked in</i>

01:19:01.423 --> 01:19:03.755
<i>So shame on me now</i>

01:19:03.755 --> 01:19:07.869
<i>Flew me to places
I'd never been</i>

01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:09.662
<i>Till you put me down, oh</i>

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:14.040
<i>I knew you were trouble
when you walked in</i>

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.372
<i>So shame on me now</i>

01:19:16.372 --> 01:19:20.211
<i>Flew me to places
I'd never been</i>

01:19:20.211 --> 01:19:22.950
<i>Now I'm lying
on the cold hard ground</i>

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:25.986
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

01:19:25.986 --> 01:19:28.351
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

01:19:28.991 --> 01:19:32.454
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

01:19:32.454 --> 01:19:34.291
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:36.425
<i>And the saddest fear</i>

01:19:37.362 --> 01:19:39.593
<i>Comes creeping in</i>

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:42.827
<i>That you never loved me</i>

01:19:42.827 --> 01:19:46.974
<i>Or her, or anyone, or anything</i>

01:19:46.974 --> 01:19:50.736
<i>- Yeah</i>
<i>I knew you were trouble</i>

01:19:50.736 --> 01:19:53.013
<i>When you walked in</i>

01:19:53.013 --> 01:19:55.048
<i>So shame on me now</i>

01:19:55.048 --> 01:19:58.183
<i>Flew me to places
I'd never been</i>

01:19:58.183 --> 01:19:59.250
<i>Never been</i>

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.087
<i>Till you put me down, oh</i>

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:04.519
<i>I knew you were trouble
when you walked in</i>

01:20:04.519 --> 01:20:07.687
<i>Knew it right there
Knew it right there</i>

01:20:07.687 --> 01:20:11.691
<i>Flew me to places
I'd never been</i>

01:20:11.691 --> 01:20:14.397
<i>Now I'm lying
on the cold hard ground</i>

01:20:14.397 --> 01:20:17.202
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

01:20:17.202 --> 01:20:19.039
<i>Trouble, trouble</i>

01:20:19.039 --> 01:20:20.700
<i>- Trouble
- Trouble</i>

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.868
<i>Oh, oh-oh</i>

01:20:23.868 --> 01:20:25.870
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:30.050
<i>I knew you were trouble
when you walked in</i>

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:32.217
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

01:20:32.217 --> 01:20:36.056
<i>I knew you were trouble
when you walked in</i>

01:20:36.056 --> 01:20:38.586
<i>Trouble, trouble, trouble</i>

01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:03.083
<i>L.A., are you enjoying
the</i> Red <i>Era so far?</i>

01:21:09.916 --> 01:21:11.157
<i>Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear it,</i>

01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:13.324
<i>'cause there...
There is one more song</i>

01:21:13.324 --> 01:21:17.130
<i>that I was wanting to play you
from the</i> Red <i>album...</i>

01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:18.857
- <i>Um...</i>

01:21:22.005 --> 01:21:24.764
<i>If you happen to have
about 10 minutes to spare?</i>

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:31.309
<i> PLAYING)</i>

01:21:49.494 --> 01:21:52.495
<i>I walked through
the door with you</i>

01:21:52.495 --> 01:21:54.761
<i>The air was cold</i>

01:21:54.761 --> 01:21:59.007
<i>But something 'bout it
felt like home somehow</i>

01:21:59.007 --> 01:22:04.276
<i>And I left my scarf there
at your sister's house</i>

01:22:04.276 --> 01:22:10.678
<i>And you've still got it
in your drawer, even now</i>

01:22:20.162 --> 01:22:25.561
<i>Oh, your sweet disposition
and my wide-eyed gaze</i>

01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:31.138
<i>We're singing in the car
Getting lost upstate</i>

01:22:31.138 --> 01:22:35.307
<i>Autumn leaves falling down
like pieces into place</i>

01:22:35.307 --> 01:22:41.082
<i>And I can picture it
after all these days</i>

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:43.645
<i>And I know
it's long gone and</i>

01:22:43.645 --> 01:22:46.252
<i>That magic's not here
no more</i>

01:22:46.252 --> 01:22:48.056
<i>And I might be okay</i>

01:22:48.056 --> 01:22:51.587
<i>But I'm not fine at all</i>

01:22:51.587 --> 01:22:56.592
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

01:22:56.592 --> 01:23:01.762
<i>'Cause there we are again
on that little town street</i>

01:23:01.762 --> 01:23:03.698
<i>You almost ran the red</i>

01:23:03.698 --> 01:23:06.206
<i>'Cause you were
lookin' over at me</i>

01:23:06.206 --> 01:23:08.835
<i>Wind in my hair, I was there</i>

01:23:08.835 --> 01:23:14.775
<i>I remember it
all too well</i>

01:23:17.153 --> 01:23:22.189
<i>Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red</i>

01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:23.685
<i>You used to be a little kid</i>

01:23:23.685 --> 01:23:27.623
<i>With glasses
in a twin-sized bed</i>

01:23:27.623 --> 01:23:30.560
<i>Your mother's telling
stories 'bout you</i>

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.057
<i>On the tee-ball team</i>

01:23:33.057 --> 01:23:34.894
<i>You taught me 'bout your past</i>

01:23:34.894 --> 01:23:37.567
<i>Thinking your future
was me</i>

01:23:37.567 --> 01:23:40.141
<i>And you were tossing me
the car keys</i>

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:41.802
<i>"Fuck the patriarchy"</i>

01:23:41.802 --> 01:23:44.574
<i>Keychain on the ground</i>

01:23:44.574 --> 01:23:47.742
<i>We were always
skipping town</i>

01:23:47.742 --> 01:23:50.712
<i>And I was thinking
on the drive down</i>

01:23:50.712 --> 01:23:54.617
<i>Any time now
He's gonna say it's love</i>

01:23:54.617 --> 01:23:57.950
<i>You never called it
what it was</i>

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.986
<i>Till we were dead and gone
and buried</i>

01:24:00.986 --> 01:24:02.823
<i>Check the pulse and come back</i>

01:24:02.823 --> 01:24:05.232
<i>Swearing it's the same</i>

01:24:05.232 --> 01:24:08.466
<i>After three months
in the grave</i>

01:24:08.466 --> 01:24:11.304
<i>And then you wondered
where it went to</i>

01:24:11.304 --> 01:24:12.932
<i>As I reached for you</i>

01:24:12.932 --> 01:24:15.506
<i>But all I felt was shame</i>

01:24:15.506 --> 01:24:18.740
<i>And you held
my lifeless frame</i>

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:21.908
<i>And I know
it's long gone and</i>

01:24:21.908 --> 01:24:24.482
<i>There was nothing else
I could do</i>

01:24:24.482 --> 01:24:27.155
<i>And I forget about you
long enough</i>

01:24:27.155 --> 01:24:35.196
<i>To forget why I needed to</i>

01:24:35.196 --> 01:24:40.300
<i>'Cause there we are again
in the middle of the night</i>

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.027
<i>We're dancing
'round the kitchen</i>

01:24:42.027 --> 01:24:44.502
<i>In the refrigerator light</i>

01:24:44.502 --> 01:24:47.175
<i>Down the stairs, I was there</i>

01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:53.676
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

01:24:55.581 --> 01:25:00.980
<i>And there we are again
when nobody had to know</i>

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:05.193
<i>You kept me like a secret
but I kept you like an oath</i>

01:25:05.193 --> 01:25:07.822
<i>Sacred prayer and we'd swear</i>

01:25:07.822 --> 01:25:09.824
<i>To remember it</i>

01:25:09.824 --> 01:25:16.633
<i>All too well, yeah</i>

01:25:31.012 --> 01:25:34.145
<i>Well, maybe we got
lost in translation</i>

01:25:34.145 --> 01:25:36.389
<i>Maybe I asked for too much</i>

01:25:36.389 --> 01:25:39.491
<i>But maybe this thing
was a masterpiece</i>

01:25:39.491 --> 01:25:41.394
<i>Till you tore it all up</i>

01:25:41.394 --> 01:25:44.364
<i>Running scared, I was there</i>

01:25:44.364 --> 01:25:51.866
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

01:25:51.866 --> 01:25:54.506
<i>And you call me up again</i>

01:25:54.506 --> 01:25:57.575
<i>Just to break me
like a promise</i>

01:25:57.575 --> 01:26:02.206
<i>So casually cruel in
the name of "being honest"</i>

01:26:02.206 --> 01:26:06.177
<i>I'm a crumpled up
piece of paper lying here</i>

01:26:06.177 --> 01:26:12.788
<i>'Cause I remember it
all, all, all</i>

01:26:12.788 --> 01:26:15.758
<i>They say all's well
that ends well</i>

01:26:15.758 --> 01:26:18.024
<i>But I'm in a new hell</i>

01:26:18.024 --> 01:26:22.963
<i>Every time
you double-cross my mind</i>

01:26:22.963 --> 01:26:26.802
<i>You said if we had
been closer in age</i>

01:26:26.802 --> 01:26:30.410
<i>Maybe it would have been fine</i>

01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:33.710
<i>And that made me want to die</i>

01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:36.713
<i>The idea you had of me
Who was she?</i>

01:26:36.713 --> 01:26:40.244
<i>A never-needy
ever-lovely jewel</i>

01:26:40.244 --> 01:26:43.951
<i>Whose shine reflects on you</i>

01:26:43.951 --> 01:26:46.657
<i>Not weeping
in a party bathroom</i>

01:26:46.657 --> 01:26:50.793
<i>Some actress asking me
what happened, you</i>

01:26:50.793 --> 01:26:54.434
<i>That's what happened, you</i>

01:26:54.434 --> 01:26:59.637
<i>You who charmed my dad
with self-effacing jokes</i>

01:26:59.637 --> 01:27:04.235
<i>Sipping coffee like
you're on a late-night show</i>

01:27:04.235 --> 01:27:07.645
<i>But then he watched me watch
the front door all night</i>

01:27:07.645 --> 01:27:09.482
<i>Willing you to come</i>

01:27:09.482 --> 01:27:12.650
<i>And he said
"It's supposed to be fun</i>

01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:15.884
<i>"Turning 21"</i>

01:27:28.294 --> 01:27:29.832
<i>Time won't fly</i>

01:27:29.832 --> 01:27:33.099
<i>It's like
I'm paralyzed by it</i>

01:27:33.099 --> 01:27:35.442
<i>I'd like to be
my old self again</i>

01:27:35.442 --> 01:27:37.708
<i>But I'm still
trying to find it</i>

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:40.205
<i>After plaid shirt days</i>

01:27:40.205 --> 01:27:43.208
<i>And nights when
you made me your own</i>

01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:48.356
<i>Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone</i>

01:27:48.356 --> 01:27:53.559
<i>But you keep my old scarf
from that very first week</i>

01:27:53.559 --> 01:27:56.364
<i>'Cause it reminds you
of innocence</i>

01:27:56.364 --> 01:27:58.531
<i>And it smells like me</i>

01:27:58.531 --> 01:28:00.225
<i>You can't get rid of it</i>

01:28:00.898 --> 01:28:02.898
<i>'Cause you remember it</i>

01:28:02.898 --> 01:28:09.201
<i>All too well, yeah</i>

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:14.415
<i>'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so</i>

01:28:14.415 --> 01:28:16.340
<i>Back before you lost</i>

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:19.013
<i>The one real thing
you've ever known</i>

01:28:19.013 --> 01:28:21.488
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>

01:28:21.488 --> 01:28:27.857
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

01:28:29.223 --> 01:28:31.762
<i>Wind in my hair
You were there</i>

01:28:31.762 --> 01:28:34.402
<i>You remember it all</i>

01:28:34.402 --> 01:28:37.097
<i>Down the stairs
You were there</i>

01:28:37.097 --> 01:28:39.869
<i>You remember it all</i>

01:28:39.869 --> 01:28:42.267
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>

01:28:42.267 --> 01:28:48.911
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

01:28:48.911 --> 01:28:52.783
<i>And I was never good
at telling jokes</i>

01:28:52.783 --> 01:28:54.917
<i>But the punch line goes</i>

01:28:54.917 --> 01:29:00.560
<i>"I'll get older
But your lovers stay my age"</i>

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.356
<i>From when your Brooklyn
broke my skin and bones</i>

01:29:05.356 --> 01:29:10.735
<i>I'm a soldier who's
returning half her weight</i>

01:29:10.735 --> 01:29:16.136
<i>And did the twin flame
bruise paint you blue?</i>

01:29:16.136 --> 01:29:17.577
<i>Just between us</i>

01:29:17.577 --> 01:29:21.075
<i>Did the love affair
maim you, too?</i>

01:29:21.075 --> 01:29:24.947
<i>'Cause in this city's
barren cold</i>

01:29:24.947 --> 01:29:30.084
<i>I still remember
the first fall of snow</i>

01:29:30.084 --> 01:29:34.495
<i>And how it glistened
as it fell</i>

01:29:34.495 --> 01:29:38.532
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

01:29:41.933 --> 01:29:43.328
<i>Just between us</i>

01:29:43.328 --> 01:29:46.298
<i>Did the love affair
maim you</i>

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:52.271
<i>All too well?</i>

01:29:52.271 --> 01:29:56.484
<i>Just between us
Do you remember it</i>

01:29:56.484 --> 01:30:01.214
<i>All too well?</i>

01:30:02.624 --> 01:30:04.283
<i>Just between us</i>

01:30:04.283 --> 01:30:06.956
<i>- I remember it</i>
<i>Just between us</i>

01:30:06.956 --> 01:30:10.190
<i>- All too well</i>
<i>Wind in my hair</i>

01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:14.095
<i>- I was there, I was there
- I was there</i>

01:30:14.095 --> 01:30:17.769
<i>Down the stairs
I was there, I was there</i>

01:30:17.769 --> 01:30:19.540
<i>I was there</i>

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:23.038
<i>Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there</i>

01:30:24.239 --> 01:30:27.471
<i>It was rare
You remember it</i>

01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:30.782
<i>- All too well</i>
<i>Wind in my hair</i>

01:30:30.782 --> 01:30:34.621
<i>- I was there, I was there
- I was there</i>

01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:38.482
<i>Down the stairs
I was there, I was there</i>

01:30:38.482 --> 01:30:40.286
<i>I was there</i>

01:30:40.286 --> 01:30:43.696
<i>Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there</i>

01:30:45.029 --> 01:30:48.195
<i>It was rare
You remember it</i>

01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:51.330
<i>- Wind in my hair</i>

01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:55.334
<i>I was there, I was there</i>

01:30:55.334 --> 01:31:00.306
<i>Down the stairs
I was there, I was there</i>

01:31:00.306 --> 01:31:04.409
<i>Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there</i>

01:31:06.017 --> 01:31:08.754
<i>It was rare
You remember it</i>

01:31:47.124 --> 01:31:50.290
<i>I'm doing good
I'm on some new shit</i>

01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:53.898
<i>Been saying "yes"
instead of "no"</i>

01:31:53.898 --> 01:31:56.065
<i>I thought I saw you
at the bus stop</i>

01:31:56.065 --> 01:31:57.495
<i>I didn't though</i>

01:32:00.775 --> 01:32:03.402
<i>I hit the ground running
each night</i>

01:32:04.273 --> 01:32:07.472
<i>I hit the Sunday matinee</i>

01:32:07.472 --> 01:32:11.410
<i>You know the greatest films
of all time were never made</i>

01:32:14.448 --> 01:32:17.757
<i>I guess you never know
Never know</i>

01:32:17.757 --> 01:32:21.387
<i>And if you wanted me
You really should've showed</i>

01:32:21.387 --> 01:32:24.390
<i>And if you never bleed
You're never gonna grow</i>

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.096
<i>And it's all right now</i>

01:32:28.363 --> 01:32:31.837
<i>But we were something
Don't you think so?</i>

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:35.104
<i>Roaring twenties
Tossing pennies in the pool</i>

01:32:35.104 --> 01:32:38.041
<i>And if my wishes came true</i>

01:32:38.714 --> 01:32:41.209
<i>It would've been you</i>

01:32:42.179 --> 01:32:45.686
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

01:32:45.686 --> 01:32:48.986
<i>For never leaving
well enough alone</i>

01:32:48.986 --> 01:32:55.355
<i>But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one</i>

01:32:57.161 --> 01:33:00.701
<i>Ooh</i>

01:33:02.529 --> 01:33:05.706
<i>I have this dream
you're doing cool shit</i>

01:33:05.706 --> 01:33:09.006
<i>Having adventures on your own</i>

01:33:09.006 --> 01:33:11.536
<i>You meet some woman
on the Internet</i>

01:33:11.536 --> 01:33:13.043
<i>And take her home</i>

01:33:16.343 --> 01:33:19.720
<i>We never painted
by the numbers, baby</i>

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.020
<i>But we were making it count</i>

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:26.892
<i>You know the greatest loves
of all time are over now</i>

01:33:30.062 --> 01:33:33.492
<i>I guess you never know
Never know</i>

01:33:33.492 --> 01:33:37.133
<i>And it's another day
Waking up alone</i>

01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:40.532
<i>But we were something
Don't you think so?</i>

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:43.810
<i>Roaring twenties
Tossing pennies in the pool</i>

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:46.714
<i>And if my wishes came true</i>

01:33:47.409 --> 01:33:50.014
<i>It would've been you</i>

01:33:50.852 --> 01:33:54.216
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

01:33:54.216 --> 01:33:57.582
<i>For never leaving
well enough alone</i>

01:33:57.582 --> 01:34:00.222
<i>But it would've been fun</i>

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.028
<i>If you would've been the one</i>

01:34:04.028 --> 01:34:06.162
<i>Hey, yeah-yeah</i>

01:34:06.162 --> 01:34:09.770
<i>I persist and resist
the temptation to ask you</i>

01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:13.169
<i>If one thing
had been different</i>

01:34:13.169 --> 01:34:18.240
<i>Would everything
be different today?</i>

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:21.540
<i>We were something
Don't you think so?</i>

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:25.016
<i>Rosé flowing
with your chosen family</i>

01:34:25.016 --> 01:34:27.645
<i>And it would've been sweet</i>

01:34:28.384 --> 01:34:30.890
<i>If it could've been me</i>

01:34:31.827 --> 01:34:34.289
<i>In my defense, I have none</i>

01:34:35.391 --> 01:34:38.623
<i>For digging up
the grave another time</i>

01:34:38.623 --> 01:34:42.066
<i>But it would've been fun</i>

01:34:42.066 --> 01:34:44.563
<i>If you would've been
the one</i>

01:34:46.809 --> 01:34:50.437
<i>Ooh</i>

01:35:08.831 --> 01:35:12.932
<i>And so, we have brought
the</i> folklore <i>cabin to L.A.</i>

01:35:18.663 --> 01:35:22.436
<i>So, um,</i> folklore <i>is an album
that I am extremely proud of,</i>

01:35:22.436 --> 01:35:24.702
<i>- and I started, uh...</i>

01:35:25.507 --> 01:35:26.847
<i>Aw...</i>

01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:30.147
<i>- Aw... thanks.</i>

01:35:31.412 --> 01:35:33.414
<i>I immediately
was picturing</i>

01:35:33.414 --> 01:35:36.923
<i>this album taking place
in the woods,</i>

01:35:36.923 --> 01:35:39.255
<i>in an imaginary cabin.</i>

01:35:39.255 --> 01:35:41.686
<i>In my fantasy,
in my imagination,</i>

01:35:41.686 --> 01:35:43.655
<i>I am not</i>

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:46.966
<i>a lonely millennial woman
covered in cat hair,</i>

01:35:46.966 --> 01:35:48.264
<i>- um...</i>

01:35:48.264 --> 01:35:50.596
<i>...watching 700 hours
of TV a day.</i>

01:35:50.596 --> 01:35:54.765
<i>In my imagination,
I am like a...</i>

01:35:54.765 --> 01:35:56.877
<i>like a woodsy Victorian lady</i>

01:35:56.877 --> 01:35:59.770
<i>who is wandering
through the forest,</i>

01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:03.851
<i>holding, like,
a candlestick holder-thing</i>

01:36:03.851 --> 01:36:06.854
<i>and, like, you know,
collecting feathers</i>

01:36:06.854 --> 01:36:10.352
<i>to make my own quill
to write on parchment paper.</i>

01:36:10.352 --> 01:36:12.057
<i>It was a whole thing.</i>

01:36:12.057 --> 01:36:14.125
<i>That was how I pictured myself
when I was writing</i> folklore.

01:36:14.125 --> 01:36:15.819
<i>And then I was like,
you know, maybe</i>

01:36:15.819 --> 01:36:17.491
<i>I should do some other things
different on this album.</i>

01:36:17.491 --> 01:36:20.164
<i>Maybe I should try
creating characters</i>

01:36:20.164 --> 01:36:22.001
<i>and having these characters</i>

01:36:22.001 --> 01:36:24.663
<i>fall in love
and break up and...</i>

01:36:26.874 --> 01:36:30.537
<i>One of my favorite, um,
characters that I created</i>

01:36:31.837 --> 01:36:35.014
<i>is, uh, I call it
the Teenage Love Triangle.</i>

01:36:38.745 --> 01:36:42.186
<i>The catalyst character is
this teenage boy named James,</i>

01:36:43.882 --> 01:36:45.992
<i>and he</i>

01:36:45.992 --> 01:36:49.688
<i>really screws things up
with the love of his life,</i>

01:36:49.688 --> 01:36:51.899
<i>and he has
to apologize to her,</i>

01:36:51.899 --> 01:36:53.131
<i>and try to make it right,</i>

01:36:54.068 --> 01:36:56.662
<i>and long story short,</i>

01:36:56.662 --> 01:36:59.071
<i>- her name is Betty.</i>

01:37:11.316 --> 01:37:13.745
<i>Betty, I won't
make assumptions</i>

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:16.220
<i>About why you switched
your homeroom</i>

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.387
<i>But I think
it's 'cause of me</i>

01:37:21.227 --> 01:37:24.932
<i>Betty, one time I was riding
on my skateboard</i>

01:37:24.932 --> 01:37:26.692
<i>When I passed your house</i>

01:37:26.692 --> 01:37:28.628
<i>It's like
I couldn't breathe</i>

01:37:30.896 --> 01:37:33.402
<i>You heard the rumors
from Inez</i>

01:37:33.402 --> 01:37:35.899
<i>You can't believe
a word she says</i>

01:37:35.899 --> 01:37:38.737
<i>Most times
But this time it was true</i>

01:37:40.411 --> 01:37:45.381
<i>The worst thing
that I ever did</i>

01:37:45.381 --> 01:37:50.287
<i>Was what I did to you</i>

01:37:52.423 --> 01:37:55.094
<i>But if I just showed up
at your party</i>

01:37:55.094 --> 01:37:57.624
<i>Would you have me?
Would you want me?</i>

01:37:57.624 --> 01:38:00.594
<i>Would you tell me
to go fuck myself</i>

01:38:00.594 --> 01:38:02.596
<i>Or lead me to the garden?</i>

01:38:02.596 --> 01:38:05.104
<i>In the garden
would you trust me</i>

01:38:05.104 --> 01:38:08.734
<i>If I told you
it was just a summer thing?</i>

01:38:08.734 --> 01:38:10.571
<i>I'm only 17</i>

01:38:10.571 --> 01:38:15.180
<i>I don't know anything
but I know I miss you</i>

01:38:23.949 --> 01:38:26.752
<i>Betty, I know
where it all went wrong</i>

01:38:26.752 --> 01:38:28.853
<i>Your favorite song
was playing</i>

01:38:28.853 --> 01:38:31.130
<i>From the far side
of the gym</i>

01:38:33.959 --> 01:38:36.102
<i>I was nowhere to be found</i>

01:38:36.102 --> 01:38:38.797
<i>I hate the crowds
You know that</i>

01:38:38.797 --> 01:38:41.404
<i>Plus, I saw you dance
with him</i>

01:38:43.474 --> 01:38:46.013
<i>You heard the rumors
from Inez</i>

01:38:46.013 --> 01:38:48.510
<i>You can't believe
a word she says</i>

01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:51.051
<i>Most times
But this time it was true</i>

01:38:52.912 --> 01:38:57.882
<i>The worst thing
that I ever did</i>

01:38:57.882 --> 01:39:02.722
<i>Was what I did to you</i>

01:39:04.858 --> 01:39:07.628
<i>But if I just showed up
at your party</i>

01:39:07.628 --> 01:39:10.169
<i>Would you have me?
Would you want me?</i>

01:39:10.169 --> 01:39:13.073
<i>Would you tell me
to go fuck myself</i>

01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:15.174
<i>Or lead me to the garden?</i>

01:39:15.174 --> 01:39:17.671
<i>In the garden
would you trust me</i>

01:39:17.671 --> 01:39:21.213
<i>If I told you
it was just a summer thing?</i>

01:39:21.213 --> 01:39:23.083
<i>I'm only 17</i>

01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:27.879
<i>I don't know anything
but I know I miss you</i>

01:39:36.527 --> 01:39:39.858
<i>I was walking home
on broken cobblestones</i>

01:39:39.858 --> 01:39:42.696
<i>Just thinking of you
when she pulled up</i>

01:39:42.696 --> 01:39:45.930
<i>Like a figment
of my worst intentions</i>

01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:48.867
<i>She said
"James, get in, let's drive"</i>

01:39:48.867 --> 01:39:51.342
<i>Those days turned into nights</i>

01:39:51.342 --> 01:39:53.773
<i>Slept next to her but</i>

01:39:53.773 --> 01:39:57.249
<i>I dreamt of you
all summer long</i>

01:40:09.131 --> 01:40:11.428
<i>Betty, I'm here
on your doorstep</i>

01:40:11.428 --> 01:40:13.958
<i>And I planned it out
for weeks now</i>

01:40:13.958 --> 01:40:16.169
<i>But it's finally
sinking in</i>

01:40:18.998 --> 01:40:21.471
<i>Betty, right now
is the last time</i>

01:40:21.471 --> 01:40:23.935
<i>I can dream
about what happens</i>

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:26.608
<i>When you see my face again</i>

01:40:27.974 --> 01:40:32.977
<i>The only thing I wanna do</i>

01:40:32.977 --> 01:40:37.421
<i>Is make it up to you</i>

01:40:40.162 --> 01:40:43.856
<i>So, I showed up at your party</i>

01:40:50.271 --> 01:40:54.438
<i>Yeah, I showed up
at your party</i>

01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:02.776
<i>Yeah, I showed up
at your party</i>

01:41:02.776 --> 01:41:05.075
<i>Will you have me?
Will you love me?</i>

01:41:05.075 --> 01:41:07.484
<i>Will you kiss me
on the porch</i>

01:41:07.484 --> 01:41:10.190
<i>In front of
all your stupid friends?</i>

01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:11.620
<i>If you kiss me</i>

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:14.084
<i>Will it be
just like I dreamed it?</i>

01:41:14.084 --> 01:41:16.460
<i>Will it patch
your broken wings?</i>

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.198
<i>I'm only 17</i>

01:41:18.198 --> 01:41:19.991
<i>I don't know anything</i>

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:22.730
<i>But I know I miss you</i>

01:41:24.998 --> 01:41:27.636
<i>Standing in your cardigan</i>

01:41:30.003 --> 01:41:33.609
<i>Kissing in my car again</i>

01:41:33.609 --> 01:41:38.383
<i>Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you</i>

01:42:02.838 --> 01:42:06.213
<i>Rebekah rode up
on the afternoon train</i>

01:42:06.213 --> 01:42:08.248
<i>It was sunny</i>

01:42:08.248 --> 01:42:10.349
<i>Her saltbox house
on the coast</i>

01:42:10.349 --> 01:42:13.187
<i>Took her mind off St. Louis</i>

01:42:15.785 --> 01:42:19.083
<i>Bill was the heir
to the Standard Oil name</i>

01:42:19.083 --> 01:42:20.887
<i>And money</i>

01:42:20.887 --> 01:42:22.328
<i>And the town said</i>

01:42:22.328 --> 01:42:25.892
<i>"How did a middle-class
divorcée do it?"</i>

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.865
<i>The wedding was charming
If a little gauche</i>

01:42:31.865 --> 01:42:35.033
<i>There's only so far
new money goes</i>

01:42:35.033 --> 01:42:36.276
<i>They picked out a home</i>

01:42:36.276 --> 01:42:38.938
<i>And called it "Holiday House"</i>

01:42:41.646 --> 01:42:44.878
<i>Their parties were tasteful
If a little loud</i>

01:42:44.878 --> 01:42:48.079
<i>The doctor had told him
to settle down</i>

01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:52.523
<i>It must have been her fault
his heart gave out</i>

01:42:52.523 --> 01:42:54.426
<i>And they said</i>

01:42:54.426 --> 01:42:57.891
<i>"There goes the last great
American dynasty</i>

01:43:00.797 --> 01:43:02.929
<i>"Who knows
If she never showed up</i>

01:43:02.929 --> 01:43:04.227
<i>"What could've been</i>

01:43:07.441 --> 01:43:09.276
<i>"There goes
the maddest woman</i>

01:43:09.276 --> 01:43:11.069
<i>"This town has ever seen</i>

01:43:12.677 --> 01:43:16.514
<i>"She had a marvelous time
ruining everything"</i>

01:43:20.751 --> 01:43:26.788
<i>Rebekah gave up on
the Rhode Island set forever</i>

01:43:26.788 --> 01:43:30.363
<i>Flew in all her Bitch Pack
friends from the city</i>

01:43:32.367 --> 01:43:34.224
<i>Filled the pool
with champagne</i>

01:43:34.224 --> 01:43:35.896
<i>And swam with the big names</i>

01:43:35.896 --> 01:43:39.999
<i>And blew through the money
on the boys and the ballet</i>

01:43:39.999 --> 01:43:43.343
<i>And losing on
card game bets with Dalí</i>

01:43:44.676 --> 01:43:46.071
<i>And they said</i>

01:43:46.071 --> 01:43:49.811
<i>"There goes the last
great American dynasty</i>

01:43:52.816 --> 01:43:54.816
<i>"Who knows
If she never showed up</i>

01:43:54.816 --> 01:43:55.982
<i>"What could've been</i>

01:43:59.185 --> 01:44:01.284
<i>"There goes
the most shameless woman</i>

01:44:01.284 --> 01:44:03.121
<i>"This town has ever seen</i>

01:44:04.663 --> 01:44:08.731
<i>"She had a marvelous time
ruining everything"</i>

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.034
<i>They say
she was seen on occasion</i>

01:44:15.034 --> 01:44:18.708
<i>Pacing the rocks, staring
out at the midnight sea</i>

01:44:18.708 --> 01:44:21.612
<i>And in a feud
with her neighbor</i>

01:44:21.612 --> 01:44:25.275
<i>She stole his dog
and dyed it key lime green</i>

01:44:25.275 --> 01:44:27.981
<i>Fifty years is a long time</i>

01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:31.391
<i>Holiday House sat quietly
on that beach</i>

01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:34.361
<i>Free of women with madness</i>

01:44:34.361 --> 01:44:38.156
<i>Their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me</i>

01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:48.067
<i>Who knows, if I never
showed up what could've been</i>

01:44:51.039 --> 01:44:55.008
<i>There goes the loudest woman
this town has ever seen</i>

01:44:56.581 --> 01:45:00.552
<i>I had a marvelous time
ruining everything</i>

01:45:03.117 --> 01:45:07.922
<i>I had a marvelous time</i>

01:45:08.628 --> 01:45:10.221
<i>Ruining everything</i>

01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:13.862
<i>A marvelous time</i>

01:45:14.799 --> 01:45:16.667
<i>Ruining everything</i>

01:45:16.667 --> 01:45:20.704
<i>A marvelous time</i>

01:45:22.576 --> 01:45:27.909
<i>I had a marvelous time</i>

01:45:43.058 --> 01:45:44.827
<i>Salt air</i>

01:45:45.995 --> 01:45:48.600
<i>And the rust on your door</i>

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:53.605
<i>I never needed anything more</i>

01:45:53.605 --> 01:45:55.574
<i>Whispers</i>

01:45:56.742 --> 01:45:58.841
<i>Of "Are you sure?"</i>

01:45:59.778 --> 01:46:03.615
<i>"Never have I ever before"</i>

01:46:03.615 --> 01:46:06.717
<i>But I can see us
Lost in the memory</i>

01:46:06.717 --> 01:46:09.918
<i>August slipped away
into a moment in time</i>

01:46:10.756 --> 01:46:12.690
<i>'Cause it was never mine</i>

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.123
<i>And I can see us
twisted in bedsheets</i>

01:46:17.123 --> 01:46:21.325
<i>August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine</i>

01:46:21.325 --> 01:46:24.966
<i>'Cause you were
never mine, mine</i>

01:46:25.837 --> 01:46:27.639
<i>Your back</i>

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.775
<i>Beneath the sun</i>

01:46:31.775 --> 01:46:36.142
<i>Wishing I could
write my name on it</i>

01:46:36.142 --> 01:46:38.210
<i>Will you call</i>

01:46:39.477 --> 01:46:42.346
<i>When you're back at school?</i>

01:46:42.346 --> 01:46:46.493
<i>I remember thinking
I had you</i>

01:46:46.493 --> 01:46:49.155
<i>But I can see us
Lost in the memory</i>

01:46:49.155 --> 01:46:52.499
<i>August slipped away
into a moment in time</i>

01:46:53.359 --> 01:46:55.293

01:46:56.967 --> 01:46:59.704
<i>And I can see us
twisted in bedsheets</i>

01:46:59.704 --> 01:47:03.939
<i>August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine</i>

01:47:03.939 --> 01:47:06.139
<i>'Cause you were never mine</i>

01:47:06.812 --> 01:47:09.978
<i>Mine</i>

01:47:18.824 --> 01:47:22.386
<i>Back when we were still
changing for the better</i>

01:47:22.386 --> 01:47:24.894
<i>Wanting was enough</i>

01:47:24.894 --> 01:47:27.028
<i>For me, it was enough</i>

01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:30.636
<i>To live for the hope
of it all</i>

01:47:30.636 --> 01:47:32.968
<i>Cancel plans
just in case you'd call</i>

01:47:32.968 --> 01:47:35.641
<i>And say
"Meet me behind the mall"</i>

01:47:35.641 --> 01:47:38.237
<i>So much for summer love
and saying "us"</i>

01:47:38.237 --> 01:47:43.011
<i>'Cause you weren't mine
to lose</i>

01:47:43.948 --> 01:47:46.850
<i>You weren't mine to lose</i>

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.522
<i>No</i>

01:47:50.119 --> 01:47:53.087
<i>But I can see us
Lost in the memory</i>

01:47:53.087 --> 01:47:56.453
<i>August slipped away
into a moment in time</i>

01:47:57.291 --> 01:47:59.456

never mine, mine</i>

01:48:13.373 --> 01:48:15.472
<i>'Cause you were never mine</i>

01:48:16.442 --> 01:48:17.914
<i>Never mine</i>

01:48:19.984 --> 01:48:21.885
<i>But do you remember?</i>

01:48:21.885 --> 01:48:24.756
<i>Remember when I pulled up
And said, "Get in the car"</i>

01:48:24.756 --> 01:48:27.550
<i>And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?</i>

01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:30.124
<i>Back when I was living
for the hope of it all</i>

01:48:30.124 --> 01:48:31.730
<i>For the hope of it all</i>

01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:33.226
<i>"Meet me behind the mall"</i>

01:48:33.226 --> 01:48:34.293

for the hope of it all</i>

01:48:40.772 --> 01:48:42.268

<i>For the hope of it all</i>

01:48:55.479 --> 01:48:59.483
<i>For the hope of it all
- For the hope of it all</i>

01:48:59.483 --> 01:49:02.222
<i>For the hope of it all</i>

01:49:02.222 --> 01:49:04.158
<i>For the hope of it all</i>

01:49:21.177 --> 01:49:22.605
<i>And you wanna scream</i>

01:49:22.605 --> 01:49:24.508
<i>Don't call me "kid"</i>

01:49:24.508 --> 01:49:26.609
<i>Don't call me "baby"</i>

01:49:26.609 --> 01:49:28.853
<i>Look at this godforsaken mess</i>

01:49:28.853 --> 01:49:30.481
<i>That you made me</i>

01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:32.923
<i>You showed me colors
you know</i>

01:49:32.923 --> 01:49:36.454
<i>I can't see
with anyone else</i>

01:49:38.491 --> 01:49:40.491

01:49:40.491 --> 01:49:42.592
<i>Don't call me "baby"</i>

01:49:42.592 --> 01:49:46.530
<i>Look at this idiotic fool
you made me</i>

01:49:46.530 --> 01:49:49.137
<i>You taught me
a secret language</i>

01:49:49.137 --> 01:49:52.470
<i>I can't speak
with anyone else</i>

01:49:54.507 --> 01:49:56.507
<i>Don't call me "kid"</i>

01:49:56.507 --> 01:49:58.641
<i>Don't call me "baby"</i>

01:49:58.641 --> 01:50:00.852
<i>Look at this
godforsaken mess</i>

01:50:00.852 --> 01:50:02.546
<i>That you made me</i>

01:50:02.546 --> 01:50:04.889
<i>You showed me colors
you know</i>

01:50:04.889 --> 01:50:08.321
<i>I can't see with anyone else</i>

01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:12.523

01:50:25.846 --> 01:50:29.342
<i>And you know damn well</i>

01:50:29.342 --> 01:50:33.313
<i>For you I would ruin myself</i>

01:50:33.313 --> 01:50:37.922
<i>A million little times</i>

01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:42.729
<i>That's the thing
about illicit affairs</i>

01:51:17.491 --> 01:51:19.392
<i>We gather here</i>

01:51:19.392 --> 01:51:23.264
<i>We line up weeping
in a sunlit room</i>

01:51:23.264 --> 01:51:27.906
<i>And if I'm on fire</i>

01:51:27.906 --> 01:51:31.470
<i>You'll be made
of ashes, too</i>

01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:35.639
<i>Even on my worst day
Did I deserve, babe</i>

01:51:35.639 --> 01:51:38.477
<i>All the hell you gave me?</i>

01:51:39.447 --> 01:51:41.051
<i>'Cause I loved you</i>

01:51:41.051 --> 01:51:46.551
<i>I swear I loved you
Till my dying day</i>

01:51:48.718 --> 01:51:56.231
<i>I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace</i>

01:51:56.231 --> 01:52:02.600
<i>And you're the hero
flying around saving face</i>

01:52:03.944 --> 01:52:08.815
<i>And if I'm dead to you
Why are you at the wake?</i>

01:52:09.477 --> 01:52:11.246
<i>Cursing my name</i>

01:52:11.246 --> 01:52:13.248
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

01:52:13.248 --> 01:52:16.053
<i>Look at how my tears ricochet</i>

01:52:23.997 --> 01:52:26.866
<i>We gather stones</i>

01:52:26.866 --> 01:52:29.869
<i>Never knowing
what they'll mean</i>

01:52:31.466 --> 01:52:34.104
<i>Some to throw</i>

01:52:34.104 --> 01:52:37.635
<i>Some to make a diamond ring</i>

01:52:37.635 --> 01:52:40.209
<i>You know I didn't want to</i>

01:52:40.209 --> 01:52:41.980
<i>Have to haunt you</i>

01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.477
<i>But what a ghostly scene</i>

01:52:45.711 --> 01:52:47.480
<i>You wear the same jewels</i>

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.317
<i>That I gave you</i>

01:52:49.317 --> 01:52:52.089
<i>As you bury me</i>

01:52:55.226 --> 01:53:01.362
<i>I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace</i>

01:53:02.761 --> 01:53:04.398
<i>'Cause when I'd fight</i>

01:53:04.398 --> 01:53:10.173
<i>You used to tell me
I was brave</i>

01:53:10.173 --> 01:53:15.277
<i>And if I'm dead to you
Why are you at the wake?</i>

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.840
<i>Cursing my name</i>

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.677
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

01:53:19.677 --> 01:53:22.988
<i>Look at how
my tears ricochet</i>

01:53:22.988 --> 01:53:26.255
<i>And I can go
anywhere I want</i>

01:53:27.093 --> 01:53:28.818
<i>Anywhere I want</i>

01:53:28.818 --> 01:53:30.754
<i>Just not home</i>

01:53:30.754 --> 01:53:34.197
<i>And you can aim
for my heart, go for blood</i>

01:53:34.197 --> 01:53:38.036
<i>But you would still miss me
in your bones</i>

01:53:38.036 --> 01:53:40.940
<i>And I still talk to you</i>

01:53:41.976 --> 01:53:45.505
<i>When I'm screaming
at the sky</i>

01:53:45.505 --> 01:53:49.014
<i>And when you can't
sleep at night</i>

01:53:49.014 --> 01:53:53.447
<i>You hear
my stolen lullabies</i>

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:07.395
<i>I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace</i>

01:54:07.395 --> 01:54:13.830
<i>And so the battleships
will sink beneath the waves</i>

01:54:14.932 --> 01:54:16.866
<i>You had to kill me</i>

01:54:16.866 --> 01:54:20.606
<i>But it killed you
just the same</i>

01:54:20.606 --> 01:54:22.443
<i>Cursing my name</i>

01:54:22.443 --> 01:54:24.115
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

01:54:24.115 --> 01:54:27.481
<i>You turned into
your worst fears</i>

01:54:27.481 --> 01:54:31.716
<i>And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain</i>

01:54:31.716 --> 01:54:34.092
<i>Crossing out the good years</i>

01:54:34.092 --> 01:54:36.996
<i>And you're cursing my name</i>

01:54:36.996 --> 01:54:38.789
<i>Wishing I stayed</i>

01:54:38.789 --> 01:54:42.265
<i>Look at how
my tears ricochet</i>

01:55:38.059 --> 01:55:40.983
<i>Midnight</i>

01:55:40.983 --> 01:55:44.591
<i>You come and pick me up
No headlights</i>

01:55:47.926 --> 01:55:49.761
<i>Long drive</i>

01:55:50.995 --> 01:55:54.568
<i>Could end in burning flames
or paradise</i>

01:55:57.606 --> 01:56:00.145
<i>Fade into view, oh</i>

01:56:00.145 --> 01:56:04.413
<i>It's been a while since
I have even heard from you</i>

01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:07.416
<i>Heard from you</i>

01:56:09.255 --> 01:56:11.816
<i>I should just tell you
to leave 'cause I</i>

01:56:11.816 --> 01:56:13.917
<i>Know exactly
where it leads, but I</i>

01:56:13.917 --> 01:56:17.360
<i>Watch us go 'round
and 'round each time</i>

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:22.530
<i>You got that James Dean
daydream look in your eye</i>

01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:27.535
<i>And I got that red lip
classic thing that you like</i>

01:56:27.535 --> 01:56:30.406
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

01:56:30.406 --> 01:56:32.375
<i>We come back every time</i>

01:56:32.375 --> 01:56:35.246
<i>'Cause we never go
out of style</i>

01:56:35.246 --> 01:56:37.842
<i>We never go out of style</i>

01:56:37.842 --> 01:56:42.880
<i>You got that long hair
Slicked back, white T-shirt</i>

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.685
<i>And I got that good girl faith</i>

01:56:45.685 --> 01:56:48.050
<i>And a tight little skirt</i>

01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:50.723
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

01:56:50.723 --> 01:56:52.923
<i>We come back every time</i>

01:56:52.923 --> 01:56:55.596
<i>'Cause we never go
out of style</i>

01:56:55.596 --> 01:56:58.698
<i>We never go out of style</i>

01:56:58.698 --> 01:57:01.470
<i>Take me home</i>

01:57:03.144 --> 01:57:06.310
<i>Just take me home</i>

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.312
<i>Yeah</i>

01:57:08.312 --> 01:57:10.743
<i>Just take me home</i>

01:57:10.743 --> 01:57:16.782
<i>Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oh</i>

01:57:16.782 --> 01:57:18.421
<i>Out of style
- Oh</i>

01:57:18.421 --> 01:57:23.393
<i>You got that James Dean
daydream look in your eye</i>

01:57:23.393 --> 01:57:25.890
<i>And I got that red lip
classic thing that you like</i>

01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:28.398
<i>I got that thing
that you like</i>

01:57:28.398 --> 01:57:29.828
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

01:57:29.828 --> 01:57:31.269
<i>And when we go</i>

01:57:31.269 --> 01:57:33.403
<i>We come back every time</i>

01:57:33.403 --> 01:57:39.739
<i>We never go out of style</i>

01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:57.460
<i>Nice to meet you
Where you been?</i>

01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:59.957
<i>I could show you
incredible things</i>

01:57:59.957 --> 01:58:02.498
<i>Magic, madness, heaven, sin</i>

01:58:02.498 --> 01:58:04.500
<i>Saw you there
and I thought</i>

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.601
<i>"Oh, my God
Look at that face</i>

01:58:06.601 --> 01:58:09.505
<i>"You look like
my next mistake</i>

01:58:09.505 --> 01:58:13.509
<i>"Love's a game, wanna play?"</i>

01:58:13.509 --> 01:58:14.708
<i>Ayy</i>

01:58:14.708 --> 01:58:17.447
<i>New money, suit and tie</i>

01:58:17.447 --> 01:58:19.977
<i>I can read you
like a magazine</i>

01:58:19.977 --> 01:58:22.551
<i>Ain't it funny? Rumors fly</i>

01:58:22.551 --> 01:58:24.850
<i>And I know you heard
about me</i>

01:58:24.850 --> 01:58:26.852
<i>So, hey, let's be friends</i>

01:58:26.852 --> 01:58:29.459
<i>I'm dying to see
how this one ends</i>

01:58:29.459 --> 01:58:32.055
<i>Grab your passport
and my hand</i>

01:58:32.055 --> 01:58:34.662
<i>I can make the bad guys good
for a weekend</i>

01:58:34.662 --> 01:58:37.203
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

01:58:37.203 --> 01:58:39.634
<i>Or it's gonna
go down in flames</i>

01:58:39.634 --> 01:58:42.164
<i>You can tell me
when it's over, mm</i>

01:58:42.164 --> 01:58:44.672
<i>If the high
was worth the pain</i>

01:58:44.672 --> 01:58:47.411
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:49.677
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

01:58:49.677 --> 01:58:52.251
<i>'Cause you know
I love the players</i>

01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:54.682
<i>And you love the game</i>

01:58:54.682 --> 01:58:57.421
<i>'Cause we're young
and we're reckless</i>

01:58:57.421 --> 01:58:59.720
<i>We'll take this
way too far</i>

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:02.327
<i>It'll leave you
breathless, mm</i>

01:59:02.327 --> 01:59:04.692

<i>But I've got
a blank space, baby</i>

01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:15.241
<i>- And I'll write your name</i>

01:59:19.907 --> 01:59:22.611
<i>Cherry lips, crystal skies</i>

01:59:22.611 --> 01:59:25.075
<i>I could show you
incredible things</i>

01:59:25.075 --> 01:59:27.616
<i>Stolen kisses, pretty lies</i>

01:59:27.616 --> 01:59:29.717
<i>You're the King, baby
I'm your Queen</i>

01:59:29.717 --> 01:59:32.016
<i>Find out what you want</i>

01:59:32.016 --> 01:59:34.293

01:59:34.293 --> 01:59:38.396
<i>Wait, the worst
is yet to come</i>

01:59:38.396 --> 01:59:39.958
<i>Oh, no</i>

01:59:39.958 --> 01:59:42.565
<i>Screaming, crying
Perfect storms</i>

01:59:42.565 --> 01:59:45.227
<i>I can make
all the tables turn</i>

01:59:45.227 --> 01:59:47.702
<i>Rose garden
filled with thorns</i>

01:59:47.702 --> 01:59:49.638
<i>Keep you
second-guessing like</i>

01:59:49.638 --> 01:59:51.640
<i>"Oh, my God, who is she?"</i>

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.379
<i>I get drunk on jealousy</i>

01:59:54.379 --> 01:59:56.876
<i>But you'll come back
each time you leave</i>

01:59:56.876 --> 01:59:58.317
<i>'Cause, darling
I'm a nightmare</i>

01:59:58.317 --> 01:59:59.912
<i>Dressed like a daydream</i>

01:59:59.912 --> 02:00:02.288

<i>In the front seat of his car</i>

02:09:49.875 --> 02:09:51.338
<i>He's got a one-hand feel</i>

02:09:51.338 --> 02:09:52.702
<i>On the steering wheel</i>

02:09:52.702 --> 02:09:55.639

<i>He says
"Baby, is something wrong?"</i>

02:10:00.479 --> 02:10:02.921
<i>I say, "Nothing

<i>"Man, I didn't kiss her

<i>Asking God
if he could play it again</i>

02:10:44.558 --> 02:10:46.558
<i>I was walking up
The front porch steps</i>

02:10:46.558 --> 02:10:49.297
<i>After everything that day</i>

02:10:49.297 --> 02:10:50.793
<i>Had gone all wrong</i>

02:10:50.793 --> 02:10:54.698
<i>And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away</i>

02:10:54.698 --> 02:10:57.371
<i>Got to the hallway

<i>Our song is
the slamming screen door</i>

<i>I search the party
of better bodies</i>

02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:11.229
<i>Just to learn
that my dreams aren't rare</i>

02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:14.496
<i>You're on your own, kid
You always have been</i>

02:15:30.250 --> 02:15:34.219
<i>From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes</i>

02:15:34.219 --> 02:15:38.080
<i>I gave my blood, sweat
and tears for this</i>

02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:42.084
<i>I hosted parties
and starved my body</i>

02:15:42.084 --> 02:15:46.022
<i>Like I'd be saved
by a perfect kiss</i>

02:15:46.022 --> 02:15:50.026
<i>The jokes weren't funny
I took the money</i>

02:15:50.026 --> 02:15:53.865
<i>My friends from home
don't know what to say</i>

02:15:53.865 --> 02:15:57.572
<i>I looked around
in a blood-soaked gown</i>

02:15:57.572 --> 02:16:01.576
<i>And I saw something
they can't take away</i>

02:16:01.576 --> 02:16:03.611
<i>'Cause there were pages turned</i>

02:16:03.611 --> 02:16:05.613
<i>With the bridges burned</i>

02:16:05.613 --> 02:16:09.551
<i>Everything you lose
is a step you take</i>

02:16:09.551 --> 02:16:11.784
<i>So make
the friendship bracelets</i>

02:16:11.784 --> 02:16:13.852
<i>Take the moment and taste it</i>

02:16:13.852 --> 02:16:17.823
<i>You've got no reason
to be afraid</i>

02:16:18.661 --> 02:16:20.595
<i>You're on your own, kid</i>

02:16:22.896 --> 02:16:24.764
<i>Yeah, you can face this</i>

02:16:27.164 --> 02:16:30.242
<i>You're on your own, kid
You always have been</i>

02:18:22.915 --> 02:18:24.686
<i>Meet me at midnight</i>

02:18:28.461 --> 02:18:30.857
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

02:18:30.857 --> 02:18:33.321
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

02:18:33.321 --> 02:18:35.928
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

02:18:35.928 --> 02:18:38.898
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

02:18:38.898 --> 02:18:40.735
<i>Staring at the ceiling
with you</i>

02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:46.741
<i>Oh, you don't ever
say too much</i>

02:18:48.778 --> 02:18:51.108
<i>You don't really read into</i>

02:18:52.045 --> 02:18:56.454
<i>My melancholia</i>

02:18:59.492 --> 02:19:01.888
<i>- I've been under scrutiny</i>
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

02:19:01.888 --> 02:19:04.429
<i>- You handle it beautifully</i>
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:05.958
<i>All this shit is new to me</i>

02:19:05.958 --> 02:19:07.223
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

02:19:09.392 --> 02:19:13.768
<i>I feel the lavender haze
creeping up on me</i>

02:19:14.166 --> 02:19:15.704
<i>Surreal</i>

02:19:15.704 --> 02:19:18.905
<i>I'm damned if I do give
a damn what people say</i>

02:19:18.905 --> 02:19:20.544
<i>No deal</i>

02:19:20.544 --> 02:19:24.878
<i>The 1950s shit
they want from me</i>

02:19:24.878 --> 02:19:30.147
<i>I just wanna stay
in that lavender haze</i>

02:19:30.147 --> 02:19:32.886
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

02:19:32.886 --> 02:19:35.284
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

02:19:35.284 --> 02:19:37.627
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

02:19:38.454 --> 02:19:40.289
<i>All they keep asking me</i>

02:19:40.289 --> 02:19:41.565
<i>All they keep asking me</i>

02:19:41.565 --> 02:19:46.097
<i>Is if I'm gonna be your bride</i>

02:19:48.299 --> 02:19:50.167
<i>The only kinda girl they see</i>

02:19:50.167 --> 02:19:51.476
<i>Only kinda girl they see</i>

02:19:51.476 --> 02:19:56.008
<i>Is a one-night or a wife</i>

02:19:58.881 --> 02:20:01.277
<i>- I find it dizzying</i>
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

02:20:01.277 --> 02:20:02.619
<i>They're bringing up
my history</i>

02:20:02.619 --> 02:20:03.785
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

02:20:03.785 --> 02:20:05.116
<i>But you weren't
even listening</i>

02:20:05.116 --> 02:20:06.623
<i>Yeah, oh yeah</i>

02:20:07.219 --> 02:20:08.757
<i>Ooh ooh ooh</i>

02:20:08.757 --> 02:20:13.597
<i>I feel the lavender haze
creeping up on me</i>

02:20:13.597 --> 02:20:15.423
<i>Surreal</i>

02:20:15.423 --> 02:20:18.635
<i>I'm damned if I do give

02:20:18.635 --> 02:20:20.296

02:20:24.168 --> 02:20:29.778
<i>I just wanna stay
in that lavender haze</i>

02:20:29.778 --> 02:20:31.373
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

02:20:31.373 --> 02:20:34.981
<i>- That lavender haze</i>
<i>Oh oh-oh whoa</i>

02:20:34.981 --> 02:20:37.852
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

02:20:37.852 --> 02:20:40.448
<i>Talk your talk and go viral</i>

02:20:40.448 --> 02:20:42.890
<i>I just need this love spiral</i>

02:20:42.890 --> 02:20:45.222
<i>Get it off your chest</i>

02:20:45.222 --> 02:20:46.795
<i>Get it off my desk</i>

02:20:46.795 --> 02:20:48.533
<i>Get it off my desk</i>

02:20:48.533 --> 02:20:52.537
<i>Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral</i>

02:20:52.537 --> 02:20:55.034
<i>Get it off your chest</i>

02:20:55.034 --> 02:20:58.301
<i>Get it off my desk</i>

02:20:58.301 --> 02:21:00.809
<i>I feel
- I feel</i>

02:21:00.809 --> 02:21:03.207
<i>The lavender haze
creeping up on me</i>

02:21:03.207 --> 02:21:05.011
<i>Surreal</i>

02:21:05.011 --> 02:21:08.146
<i>I'm damned if I do give

02:21:08.146 --> 02:21:09.983
<i>No deal
- No deal</i>

02:21:09.983 --> 02:21:13.756
<i>The 1950s shit
they want from me</i>

02:21:13.756 --> 02:21:19.157
<i>I just wanna stay

02:21:19.157 --> 02:21:21.764
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

02:21:21.764 --> 02:21:24.393
<i>- Oh oh-oh whoa
- Get it off your chest</i>

02:21:24.393 --> 02:21:27.000
<i>- Whoa whoa whoa whoa
- Get it off my desk</i>

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.067
<i>Oh oh-oh</i>

02:21:28.067 --> 02:21:31.070
<i>That lavender haze</i>

02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:33.435
<i>- I just wanna stay
- Oh oh-oh</i>

02:21:33.435 --> 02:21:38.880
<i>I just wanna stay
in that lavender haze</i>

02:21:47.583 --> 02:21:50.353
<i>I have this thing
where I get older</i>

02:21:50.353 --> 02:21:52.355
<i>But just never wiser</i>

02:21:52.355 --> 02:21:55.424
<i>Midnights become
my afternoons</i>

02:21:57.395 --> 02:22:00.528
<i>When my depression
works the graveyard shift</i>

02:22:00.528 --> 02:22:02.530
<i>All of the people</i>

02:22:02.530 --> 02:22:05.236
<i>I've ghosted
stand there in the room</i>

02:22:06.844 --> 02:22:10.208
<i>I should not be left
to my own devices</i>

02:22:10.208 --> 02:22:12.650
<i>They come with prices
and vices</i>

02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:14.542
<i>I end up in crisis</i>

02:22:14.542 --> 02:22:17.314
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

02:22:17.314 --> 02:22:19.756
<i>I wake up screaming
from dreaming</i>

02:22:19.756 --> 02:22:22.253
<i>One day
I'll watch as you're leaving</i>

02:22:22.253 --> 02:22:24.794
<i>'Cause you got tired
of my scheming</i>

02:22:24.794 --> 02:22:26.488
<i>For the last time</i>

02:22:26.488 --> 02:22:31.493
<i>It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me</i>

02:22:31.493 --> 02:22:37.103
<i>At teatime, everybody agrees</i>

02:22:37.103 --> 02:22:39.644
<i>I'll stare directly
at the sun</i>

02:22:39.644 --> 02:22:41.437
<i>But never in the mirror</i>

02:22:41.437 --> 02:22:46.882
<i>It must be exhausting always
rooting for the anti-hero</i>

02:22:51.856 --> 02:22:57.123
<i>Sometimes, I feel like
everybody is a sexy baby</i>

02:22:57.123 --> 02:22:59.697
<i>And I'm a monster on the hill</i>

02:23:01.866 --> 02:23:03.261
<i>Too big to hang out</i>

02:23:03.261 --> 02:23:06.770
<i>Slowly lurching toward
your favorite city</i>

02:23:06.770 --> 02:23:09.531
<i>Pierced through the heart
but never killed</i>

02:23:11.634 --> 02:23:14.844
<i>Did you hear
my covert narcissism</i>

02:23:14.844 --> 02:23:17.110
<i>I disguise as altruism</i>

02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:19.277
<i>Like some kind
of congressman?</i>

02:23:19.277 --> 02:23:21.213
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

02:23:21.213 --> 02:23:23.985
<i>I wake up screaming
from dreaming</i>

02:23:23.985 --> 02:23:26.647
<i>One day
I'll watch as you're leaving</i>

02:23:26.647 --> 02:23:29.023
<i>And life will lose
all its meaning</i>

02:23:29.023 --> 02:23:30.552
<i>For the last time</i>

02:23:30.552 --> 02:23:33.027
<i>It's me, hi</i>

02:23:33.027 --> 02:23:35.700
<i>I'm the problem, it's me</i>

02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:40.364
<i>At teatime, everybody agrees</i>

02:23:41.499 --> 02:23:43.807
<i>I'll stare directly
at the sun</i>

02:23:43.807 --> 02:23:45.875
<i>But never in the mirror</i>

02:23:45.875 --> 02:23:51.210
<i>It must be exhausting always
rooting for the anti-hero</i>

02:23:56.283 --> 02:23:57.722
<i>I have this dream</i>

02:23:57.722 --> 02:24:01.154
<i>My daughter-in-law kills me
for the money</i>

02:24:01.154 --> 02:24:04.124
<i>She thinks I left them
in the will</i>

02:24:06.062 --> 02:24:08.898
<i>The family gathers 'round
and reads it</i>

02:24:08.898 --> 02:24:11.065
<i>And then someone
screams out</i>

02:24:11.065 --> 02:24:13.903
<i>"She's laughing up at us
from hell"</i>

02:24:15.368 --> 02:24:18.270
<i>It's me, hi</i>

02:24:18.270 --> 02:24:20.503
<i>I'm the problem, it's me</i>

02:24:20.503 --> 02:24:22.813
<i>It's me, hi</i>

02:24:23.981 --> 02:24:25.508
<i>I'm the problem, it's me</i>

02:24:25.508 --> 02:24:27.983
<i>It's me, hi</i>

02:24:29.217 --> 02:24:35.188
<i>Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees</i>

02:24:35.188 --> 02:24:36.926
<i>It's me</i>

02:24:36.926 --> 02:24:38.587
<i>- Hi
- Hi</i>

02:24:38.587 --> 02:24:40.765
<i>- I'm the problem, it's me
- I'm the problem, it's me</i>

02:24:40.765 --> 02:24:43.097
<i>- At teatime
- Teatime</i>

02:24:43.097 --> 02:24:46.034
<i>- Everybody agrees
- Everybody agrees</i>

02:24:46.034 --> 02:24:48.432
<i>I'll stare directly
at the sun</i>

02:24:48.432 --> 02:24:50.467
<i>But never in the mirror</i>

02:24:50.467 --> 02:24:55.842
<i>It must be exhausting always
rooting for the anti-hero</i>

02:25:08.322 --> 02:25:09.750
<i>Rain</i>

02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:12.654
<i>He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain</i>

02:25:12.654 --> 02:25:15.965
<i>He wanted a bride
I was making my own name</i>

02:25:15.965 --> 02:25:17.626
<i>Chasing that fame</i>

02:25:17.626 --> 02:25:19.496
<i>He stayed the same</i>

02:25:19.496 --> 02:25:22.202
<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

02:25:36.317 --> 02:25:39.186
<i>My town
was a wasteland</i>

02:25:39.186 --> 02:25:40.957
<i>Full of cages, full of fences</i>

02:25:40.957 --> 02:25:43.993
<i>Pageant queens
and big pretenders</i>

02:25:43.993 --> 02:25:47.491
<i>But for some it was paradise</i>

02:25:50.067 --> 02:25:52.793
<i>My boy was a montage</i>

02:25:52.793 --> 02:25:54.630
<i>A slow motion, love potion</i>

02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:57.600
<i>Jumping off things
in the ocean</i>

02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:00.603
<i>I broke his heart
'cause he was nice</i>

02:26:00.603 --> 02:26:02.979
<i>He was sunshine
I was midnight</i>

02:26:02.979 --> 02:26:04.442
<i>Rain</i>

02:26:04.442 --> 02:26:07.379
<i>He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain</i>

02:26:07.379 --> 02:26:10.888
<i>He wanted a bride
I was making my own name</i>

02:26:10.888 --> 02:26:12.681
<i>Chasing that fame</i>

02:26:12.681 --> 02:26:14.551
<i>He stayed the same</i>

02:26:14.551 --> 02:26:17.389
<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:20.458
<i>It came like a postcard</i>

02:26:20.458 --> 02:26:22.196
<i>Picture perfect shiny family</i>

02:26:22.196 --> 02:26:25.166
<i>Holiday peppermint candy</i>

02:26:25.166 --> 02:26:27.839
<i>But for him it's every day</i>

02:26:30.734 --> 02:26:34.010
<i>So I peered through a window</i>

02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:35.836
<i>A deep portal, time travel</i>

02:26:35.836 --> 02:26:38.014
<i>All the love we unravel</i>

02:26:38.775 --> 02:26:41.512
<i>And the life I gave away</i>

02:26:41.512 --> 02:26:45.351
<i>'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain</i>

02:26:45.351 --> 02:26:48.717
<i>He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain</i>

02:26:48.717 --> 02:26:52.061
<i>He wanted a bride
I was making my own name</i>

02:26:52.061 --> 02:26:53.898
<i>Chasing that fame</i>

02:26:53.898 --> 02:26:55.559
<i>He stayed the same</i>

02:26:55.559 --> 02:26:58.067
<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

02:26:58.067 --> 02:26:59.530
<i>Rain</i>

02:26:59.530 --> 02:27:02.500
<i>He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain</i>

02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:05.866
<i>He wanted a bride
I was making my own name</i>

02:27:05.866 --> 02:27:07.505
<i>Chasing that fame</i>

02:27:07.505 --> 02:27:09.342
<i>He stayed the same</i>

02:27:09.342 --> 02:27:11.916
<i>All of me changed
Like midnight</i>

02:27:11.916 --> 02:27:14.611
<i>I guess sometimes we all get</i>

02:27:14.611 --> 02:27:18.417
<i>Just what we wanted
Just what we wanted</i>

02:27:18.417 --> 02:27:20.551
<i>And he never thinks of me</i>

02:27:21.752 --> 02:27:23.785
<i>Except when I'm on TV</i>

02:27:25.688 --> 02:27:28.361
<i>I guess sometimes we all get</i>

02:27:28.361 --> 02:27:32.200
<i>Some kind of haunted
Some kind of haunted</i>

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:33.938
<i>And I never think of him</i>

02:27:35.337 --> 02:27:37.865
<i>Except on midnights like this</i>

02:27:37.865 --> 02:27:39.537
<i>Midnights like this</i>

02:27:39.537 --> 02:27:41.913
<i>Midnights like this</i>

02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:59.425
<i>Draw the cat eye
sharp enough to kill a man</i>

02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:06.597
<i>You did some bad things
but I'm the worst of them</i>

02:28:08.106 --> 02:28:11.602
<i>Sometimes I wonder which one
will be your last lie</i>

02:28:14.046 --> 02:28:18.378
<i>They say looks can kill
and I might try</i>

02:28:19.315 --> 02:28:21.447
<i>I don't dress for women</i>

<i>I don't dress for men</i>

<i>Lately I've been
dressing for revenge</i>

02:28:29.257 --> 02:28:33.657
<i>I don't start shit, but
I can tell you how it ends</i>

02:28:35.166 --> 02:28:39.168
<i>Don't get sad, get even</i>

02:28:40.204 --> 02:28:43.172
<i>So on the weekends</i>

02:28:43.172 --> 02:28:45.372

02:28:45.372 --> 02:28:48.408
<i>Lately I've been
dressing for revenge</i>

02:28:50.005 --> 02:28:53.578
<i>She needed cold hard proof
so I gave her some</i>

02:28:56.154 --> 02:28:57.516
<i>She had the envelope</i>

02:28:57.516 --> 02:29:01.025
<i>Where you think
she got it from?</i>

02:29:02.391 --> 02:29:03.555
<i>Now she gets the house</i>

02:29:03.555 --> 02:29:05.755
<i>Gets the kids
Gets the pride</i>

02:29:08.496 --> 02:29:13.070
<i>Picture me thick as thieves
with your ex-wife</i>

02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:15.402
<i>And she looks so pretty</i>

02:29:16.339 --> 02:29:18.504

<i>The lady simply had enough</i>

02:29:58.247 --> 02:30:01.217
<i>While he was doing lines</i>

02:30:01.217 --> 02:30:03.516
<i>And crossing all of mine</i>

02:30:03.516 --> 02:30:06.915
<i>Someone told
his white collar crimes</i>

02:30:06.915 --> 02:30:10.193
<i>To the FBI</i>

02:31:00.311 --> 02:31:04.280
<i>Baby love, I think I've been
a little too kind</i>

02:31:06.449 --> 02:31:09.846
<i>Didn't notice you walking
all over my peace of mind</i>

02:31:09.846 --> 02:31:11.749
<i>In the shoes
I gave you as a present</i>

02:31:11.749 --> 02:31:13.916
<i>Putting someone first
only works</i>

02:31:13.916 --> 02:31:15.852
<i>When you're in their top five</i>

02:31:17.119 --> 02:31:18.525
<i>And by the way</i>

02:31:20.122 --> 02:31:21.858
<i>I'm going out tonight</i>

02:31:23.532 --> 02:31:25.367
<i>Best believe
I'm still bejeweled</i>

<i>When I walk in the room</i>

02:31:26.863 --> 02:31:29.635
<i>I can still make
the whole place shimmer</i>

02:31:29.635 --> 02:31:30.999
<i>And when I meet the band</i>

02:31:30.999 --> 02:31:32.605
<i>They ask
"Do you have a man?"</i>

02:31:32.605 --> 02:31:35.377
<i>I could still say
"I don't remember"</i>

02:31:35.377 --> 02:31:38.677
<i>Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement</i>

02:31:38.677 --> 02:31:41.383

I polish up real nice</i>

02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:53.329
<i>Nice</i>

02:31:58.897 --> 02:32:02.668
<i>Baby boy, I think I've been
too good of a girl</i>

02:32:02.668 --> 02:32:04.901
<i>Too good of a girl</i>

02:32:04.901 --> 02:32:08.575
<i>Did all the extra credit
Then got graded on a curve</i>

02:32:08.575 --> 02:32:10.346
<i>I think it's time
to teach some lessons</i>

02:32:10.346 --> 02:32:12.480
<i>I made you my world
Have you heard?</i>

02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:14.713
<i>I can reclaim the land</i>

02:32:16.046 --> 02:32:17.749
<i>And I miss you</i>

02:32:18.554 --> 02:32:21.082
<i>But I miss sparkling</i>

02:32:21.082 --> 02:32:22.358
<i>Nice</i>

<i>Nice</i>

02:32:57.219 --> 02:32:59.362
<i>Sapphire tears on my face</i>

02:32:59.362 --> 02:33:03.058
<i>Sadness became my whole sky</i>

02:33:03.058 --> 02:33:06.028
<i>But some guy said
my aura's moonstone</i>

02:33:06.028 --> 02:33:09.273
<i>Just 'cause he was high</i>

02:33:09.273 --> 02:33:10.934
<i>And we're dancing all night</i>

02:33:10.934 --> 02:33:12.474

<i>To change my mind</i>

02:33:13.871 --> 02:33:15.972
<i>But you might have
to wait in line</i>

02:33:15.972 --> 02:33:17.875
<i>What's a girl gonna do?</i>

02:33:17.875 --> 02:33:20.812
<i>A diamond's gotta shine</i>

the planets and the fates</i>

<i>At the same time</i>

02:34:36.283 --> 02:34:40.023
<i>And the touch of a hand
lit the fuse</i>

02:34:40.023 --> 02:34:43.862
<i>Of a chain reaction
of countermoves</i>

02:34:43.862 --> 02:34:48.031
<i>To assess the equation of you</i>

02:34:48.031 --> 02:34:50.836
<i>Checkmate, I couldn't lose</i>

02:34:50.836 --> 02:34:53.872

none of it was accidental?</i>

02:34:53.872 --> 02:34:55.709
<i>And the first night
that you saw me</i>

02:34:55.709 --> 02:34:57.975
<i>Nothing was gonna stop me</i>

02:34:57.975 --> 02:35:01.814
<i>I laid the groundwork
and then just like clockwork</i>

02:35:01.814 --> 02:35:04.344
<i>The dominoes
cascaded in a line</i>

02:35:04.344 --> 02:35:07.248
<i>What if I told you
I'm a mastermind?</i>

02:35:09.428 --> 02:35:11.428
<i>And now you're mine</i>

02:35:12.431 --> 02:35:14.695
<i>It was all my design</i>

02:35:16.259 --> 02:35:19.194
<i>'Cause I'm a mastermind</i>

02:35:22.067 --> 02:35:28.302
<i>You see all the wisest women
had to do it this way</i>

02:35:30.042 --> 02:35:32.042
<i>'Cause we were born to be</i>

02:35:32.042 --> 02:35:36.310
<i>The pawn
in every lover's game</i>

02:35:37.489 --> 02:35:41.051
<i>If you fail to plan
You plan to fail</i>

02:35:41.051 --> 02:35:45.055
<i>Strategy sets the scene
for the tale</i>

02:35:45.055 --> 02:35:49.290
<i>I'm the wind
in our free-flowing sails</i>

02:35:49.290 --> 02:35:51.633
<i>And the liquor
in our cocktails</i>

02:35:51.633 --> 02:35:54.867
<i>What if I told you
none of it was accidental?</i>

02:35:54.867 --> 02:35:56.869
<i>And the first night
that you saw me</i>

02:35:56.869 --> 02:35:58.739
<i>I knew I wanted your body</i>

02:35:58.739 --> 02:36:02.743

<i>'Cause I'm a mastermind</i>

02:36:22.457 --> 02:36:25.964
<i>No one wanted to play
with me as a little kid</i>

02:36:25.964 --> 02:36:29.770
<i>So I've been scheming
like a criminal ever since</i>

02:36:29.770 --> 02:36:33.642
<i>To make them love me
and make it seem effortless</i>

02:36:33.642 --> 02:36:36.942
<i>This is the first time I've
felt the need to confess</i>

02:36:36.942 --> 02:36:40.308
<i>And I swear</i>

02:36:40.308 --> 02:36:43.245
<i>I'm only cryptic
and Machiavellian</i>

02:36:43.245 --> 02:36:45.445
<i>'Cause I care</i>

02:36:45.445 --> 02:36:48.283
<i>So I told you none of it
was accidental</i>

02:36:48.283 --> 02:36:50.120
<i>And the first night
that you saw me</i>

02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:52.254
<i>Nothing was gonna stop me</i>

02:36:52.254 --> 02:36:56.093
<i>I laid the groundwork
and then saw a wide smirk</i>

02:36:56.093 --> 02:36:59.030
<i>On your face
You knew the entire time</i>

02:36:59.030 --> 02:37:02.033
<i>You knew
that I'm a mastermind</i>

02:37:03.674 --> 02:37:05.707
<i>And now you're mine</i>

02:37:06.743 --> 02:37:09.238
<i>Yeah, all you did
was smile</i>

02:37:10.549 --> 02:37:14.309
<i>'Cause I'm a mastermind</i>

02:37:34.738 --> 02:37:36.133
<i>You have absolutely given us</i>

02:37:36.133 --> 02:37:37.937
<i>everything that you have tonight,</i>

02:37:38.940 --> 02:37:41.204
<i>so I feel guilty asking...</i>

02:37:41.204 --> 02:37:43.976
<i>but could we have one more
song's worth of your time?</i>

02:37:56.628 --> 02:37:59.354
<i>You're talking shit
for the hell of it</i>

02:37:59.354 --> 02:38:02.060
<i>Addicted to betrayal
but you're relevant</i>

02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:05.096
<i>You're terrified to look down</i>

02:38:07.232 --> 02:38:09.903
<i>'Cause if you dare
You'll see the glare</i>

02:38:09.903 --> 02:38:12.741
<i>Of everyone you burned
just to get there</i>

02:38:12.741 --> 02:38:15.612
<i>It's coming back around</i>

02:38:17.143 --> 02:38:22.751
<i>And I keep my side
of the street clean</i>

02:38:22.751 --> 02:38:26.623

02:38:39.603 --> 02:38:42.364
<i>Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat</i>

02:38:42.364 --> 02:38:44.773
<i>Purring in my lap
'cause it loves me</i>

02:38:44.773 --> 02:38:47.567
<i>Flexing like
a goddamn acrobat</i>

02:38:47.567 --> 02:38:50.042
<i>Me and karma vibe like that</i>

<i>Spiderboy, king of thieves</i>

02:38:52.979 --> 02:38:55.619

Rattling your ground</i>

02:39:59.683 --> 02:40:02.785
<i>Karma's on your scent
like a bounty hunter</i>

02:40:02.785 --> 02:40:05.018
<i>Karma's gonna
track you down</i>

02:40:05.018 --> 02:40:07.548
<i>Step by step
from town to town</i>

02:40:07.548 --> 02:40:10.386
<i>Sweet like justice
Karma is a queen</i>

02:40:10.386 --> 02:40:13.653
<i>Karma takes all my friends
to the summit</i>

02:40:13.653 --> 02:40:15.699
<i>Karma is the guy
on the screen</i>

02:40:15.699 --> 02:40:17.558
<i>Coming straight home to me</i>

02:40:17.558 --> 02:40:19.362
<i>'Cause karma is my boyfriend</i>

02:40:19.362 --> 02:40:20.968
<i>Karma is a god</i>

02:40:20.968 --> 02:40:24.301
<i>Karma is the breeze
in my hair on the weekend</i>

02:40:24.301 --> 02:40:26.402
<i>Karma's a relaxing thought</i>

02:40:26.402 --> 02:40:29.042
<i>Aren't you envious
that for you it's not?</i>

02:40:29.042 --> 02:40:31.748
<i>Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat</i>

02:40:31.748 --> 02:40:34.080
<i>Purring in my lap
'cause it loves me</i>

02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:37.017
<i>Flexing like
a goddamn acrobat</i>

02:40:37.017 --> 02:40:39.349
<i>Me and karma vibe like that</i>

02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:41.054
<i>Ah</i>

02:40:41.054 --> 02:40:43.518
<i>Karma is my boyfriend</i>

02:40:43.518 --> 02:40:47.764
<i>- Karma is a god</i>
<i>Ah</i>

02:40:47.764 --> 02:40:50.591
<i>Uh-huh, mm</i>

02:40:50.591 --> 02:40:51.900
<i>Ah</i>

02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:56.333
<i>Karma's a relaxing thought</i>

02:40:56.333 --> 02:41:00.876
<i>Ah</i>

02:41:00.876 --> 02:41:06.541
<i>L.A., every single person on
this stage loves you so much.</i>

02:41:06.541 --> 02:41:09.544
<i>So will you please
show that love right back</i>

02:41:09.544 --> 02:41:11.414
<i>to my amazing dancers!</i>

02:41:22.999 --> 02:41:25.967
<i>And now,
please make some noise</i>

02:41:25.967 --> 02:41:28.937
<i>for my extraordinary
backing vocalists!</i>

02:41:35.143 --> 02:41:36.879
<i>And will you please
direct your attention</i>

02:41:36.879 --> 02:41:38.606
<i>to the main stage</i>

02:41:38.606 --> 02:41:41.785
<i>and give it up
for my phenomenal band!</i>

02:43:55.712 --> 02:43:57.712
<i>Combat</i>

02:43:58.550 --> 02:44:01.320
<i>I'm ready for combat</i>

02:44:02.224 --> 02:44:05.159
<i>I say I don't want that</i>

02:44:06.162 --> 02:44:07.997
<i>But what if I do?</i>

02:44:10.793 --> 02:44:13.937
<i>'Cause cruelty</i>

02:44:13.937 --> 02:44:16.940
<i>Wins in the movies</i>

02:44:18.108 --> 02:44:21.142
<i>I've got 100
thrown-out speeches</i>

02:44:21.142 --> 02:44:23.947
<i>I almost said to you</i>

02:44:26.083 --> 02:44:29.480
<i>Easy they come
Easy they go</i>

02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:33.451
<i>I jump from the train
I ride off alone</i>

02:44:33.451 --> 02:44:37.653
<i>I never grew up
It's getting so old</i>

02:44:37.653 --> 02:44:40.623
<i>Help me hold onto you</i>

02:44:40.623 --> 02:44:44.231
<i>I've been the archer</i>

02:44:44.231 --> 02:44:46.937
<i>I've been the prey</i>

02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:51.975
<i>Who could ever
leave me, darling?</i>

02:44:51.975 --> 02:44:54.868

02:44:57.213 --> 02:44:59.477
<i>Dark side</i>

02:44:59.477 --> 02:45:03.316
<i>I search for your dark side</i>

02:45:03.316 --> 02:45:06.418
<i>But what if I'm all right</i>

02:45:06.418 --> 02:45:10.686
<i>Right, right, right here?</i>

02:45:12.030 --> 02:45:14.822
<i>And I cut off</i>

02:45:14.822 --> 02:45:19.035
<i>My nose
just to spite my face</i>

02:45:19.035 --> 02:45:22.863
<i>Then I hate my reflection</i>

02:45:22.863 --> 02:45:25.635
<i>For years and years</i>

02:45:27.507 --> 02:45:31.443
<i>I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost</i>

02:45:31.443 --> 02:45:35.216
<i>The room is on fire
Invisible smoke</i>

02:45:35.216 --> 02:45:39.352
<i>And all of my heroes
die all alone</i>

02:45:39.352 --> 02:45:42.157
<i>Help me hold onto you</i>

02:45:42.157 --> 02:45:45.556

<i>I've been the prey</i>

02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.036
<i>Screaming, who could

02:45:53.036 --> 02:45:56.369
<i>But who could stay?</i>

02:45:58.241 --> 02:46:00.406
<i>'Cause they see
right through me</i>

02:46:00.406 --> 02:46:02.243
<i>They see right through me</i>

02:46:02.243 --> 02:46:03.871
<i>They see right through</i>

02:46:03.871 --> 02:46:05.972
<i>Can you see right through me?</i>

02:46:05.972 --> 02:46:07.710
<i>They see right through</i>

02:46:07.710 --> 02:46:09.811
<i>They see right through me</i>

02:46:09.811 --> 02:46:13.815
<i>I see right through me</i>

02:46:13.815 --> 02:46:17.390
<i>All the king's horses
All the king's men</i>

02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:21.229
<i>Couldn't put me
together again</i>

02:46:21.229 --> 02:46:25.024
<i>'Cause all of my enemies
started out friends</i>

02:46:25.024 --> 02:46:28.170
<i>Help me hold onto you</i>

02:46:28.170 --> 02:46:31.305
<i>I've been the archer</i>

02:46:32.033 --> 02:46:34.803

02:47:07.805 --> 02:47:10.311
<i>Combat</i>

02:47:10.311 --> 02:47:15.382
<i>I'm ready for combat</i>

02:47:39.001 --> 02:47:42.673
<i>He said
"Let's get out of this town"</i>

02:47:42.673 --> 02:47:46.182
<i>Drive out of this city
away from the crowds</i>

02:47:46.182 --> 02:47:49.482
<i>I thought
"Heaven can't help me now"</i>

02:47:49.482 --> 02:47:51.583
<i>Nothing lasts forever</i>

02:47:51.583 --> 02:47:54.685
<i>But this is gonna
take me down</i>

02:47:54.685 --> 02:47:57.490
<i>He's so tall
and handsome as hell</i>

02:47:57.490 --> 02:48:00.757
<i>He's so bad
but he does it so well</i>

02:48:00.757 --> 02:48:03.925
<i>I can see the end
as it begins</i>

02:48:03.925 --> 02:48:06.994
<i>My one condition is...</i>

02:48:06.994 --> 02:48:09.931
<i>Say you'll remember me</i>

02:48:09.931 --> 02:48:14.177
<i>Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe</i>

02:48:14.177 --> 02:48:16.773
<i>Red lips and rosy cheeks</i>

02:48:16.773 --> 02:48:21.107
<i>Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your</i>

02:48:21.107 --> 02:48:23.780
<i>Wildest dreams</i>

02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:26.486
<i>Ah-ah, ha</i>

02:48:28.017 --> 02:48:30.853
<i>Wildest dreams</i>

02:48:30.853 --> 02:48:33.020
<i>Ah-ah, ha</i>

02:48:34.925 --> 02:48:38.564
<i>You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night</i>

02:48:38.564 --> 02:48:41.402
<i>Burning it down</i>

02:48:41.402 --> 02:48:45.208
<i>Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories</i>

02:48:45.208 --> 02:48:48.211
<i>Follow you around...</i>

02:48:48.211 --> 02:48:52.171
<i>You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night</i>

02:48:52.171 --> 02:48:55.251
<i>Burning it down</i>

02:48:55.251 --> 02:48:58.980
<i>Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories</i>

02:48:58.980 --> 02:49:01.917

02:49:01.917 --> 02:49:05.723
<i>You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night</i>

02:49:05.723 --> 02:49:09.089

<i>Follow you around</i>

02:50:14.288 --> 02:50:17.333
<i>I said
Remember this moment</i>

02:50:19.194 --> 02:50:22.437
<i>In the back of my mind</i>

02:50:23.803 --> 02:50:27.607
<i>The time we stood
with our shaking hands</i>

02:50:27.607 --> 02:50:31.479
<i>The crowds in stands went wild</i>

02:50:33.239 --> 02:50:36.682
<i>We were
the kings and the queens</i>

02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:42.457
<i>And they read off our names</i>

02:50:42.457 --> 02:50:46.285
<i>The night you danced like
you knew our lives</i>

02:50:46.285 --> 02:50:50.223
<i>Would never be the same</i>

02:50:51.996 --> 02:50:55.129
<i>You held your head
like a hero</i>

02:50:56.902 --> 02:51:00.200
<i>On a history book page</i>

02:51:01.335 --> 02:51:04.677
<i>It was the end of a decade</i>

02:51:06.241 --> 02:51:09.517
<i>But the start of an age</i>

02:51:12.214 --> 02:51:15.853
<i>Long live
the walls we crashed through</i>

02:51:15.853 --> 02:51:20.154
<i>How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you</i>

02:51:20.154 --> 02:51:24.829
<i>I was screaming
Long live
all the magic we made</i>

02:51:24.829 --> 02:51:28.371
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders</i>

02:51:28.371 --> 02:51:32.870
<i>One day
we will be remembered</i>

02:51:34.203 --> 02:51:37.347
<i>I said
Remember this feeling</i>

02:51:38.878 --> 02:51:42.275
<i>I pass the pictures around</i>

02:51:43.883 --> 02:51:46.752
<i>Of all the years
that we stood there</i>

02:51:46.752 --> 02:51:52.120
<i>On the sidelines
wishing for right now</i>

02:51:53.255 --> 02:51:56.663
<i>We are
the kings and the queens</i>

02:51:56.663 --> 02:52:01.129
<i>You traded your baseball cap
for a crown</i>

02:52:03.034 --> 02:52:06.233
<i>When they gave us
our trophies</i>

02:52:06.233 --> 02:52:11.106
<i>And we held them up
for our town</i>

02:52:12.307 --> 02:52:15.946
<i>And the cynics were outraged</i>

02:52:17.114 --> 02:52:21.281
<i>Screaming, this is absurd</i>

02:52:21.281 --> 02:52:27.463
<i>'Cause for a moment
a band of thieves
in ripped-up jeans</i>

02:52:27.463 --> 02:52:32.468
<i>Got to rule the world</i>

02:52:32.468 --> 02:52:36.032
<i>Long live the walls
we crashed through</i>

02:52:36.032 --> 02:52:40.135
<i>How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you</i>

02:52:40.135 --> 02:52:44.909
<i>I was screaming
Long live
all the magic we made</i>

02:52:44.909 --> 02:52:51.113
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders
I'm not afraid</i>

02:52:51.113 --> 02:52:54.380
<i>Long live
all the mountains we moved</i>

02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:59.462
<i>I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you</i>

02:52:59.462 --> 02:53:03.763
<i>I was screaming
Long live
that look on your face</i>

02:53:03.763 --> 02:53:07.327
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders</i>

02:53:07.327 --> 02:53:11.705
<i>One day
we will be remembered</i>

02:53:15.612 --> 02:53:18.976
<i>Hold on
to spinning around</i>

02:53:18.976 --> 02:53:23.783
<i>Confetti falls
to the ground</i>

02:53:23.783 --> 02:53:30.625
<i>May these memories
break our fall</i>

02:53:32.662 --> 02:53:35.289
<i>Will you take a moment</i>

02:53:37.832 --> 02:53:39.568
<i>Promise me this</i>

02:53:41.671 --> 02:53:45.299
<i>That you'll
stand by me forever</i>

02:53:45.299 --> 02:53:48.841
<i>But if, God forbid
Fate should step in</i>

02:53:51.142 --> 02:53:54.682
<i>- And force us into a goodbye</i>

02:53:55.718 --> 02:53:58.719
<i>If you have children someday</i>

02:54:00.822 --> 02:54:03.856
<i>When they point
to the pictures</i>

02:54:05.387 --> 02:54:07.563
<i>Please tell them my name</i>

02:54:10.425 --> 02:54:15.296
<i>Tell them how
the crowds went wild</i>

02:54:15.296 --> 02:54:19.542
<i>Tell them how
I hope they shine</i>

02:54:20.842 --> 02:54:24.074
<i>Long live
the walls we crashed through</i>

02:54:24.074 --> 02:54:27.176
<i>I had the time of my life</i>

02:54:27.176 --> 02:54:29.750
<i>With you</i>

fighting dragons with you</i>

02:57:05.204 --> 02:57:08.777
<i>I said
Remember this feeling</i>

02:57:10.077 --> 02:57:13.276
<i>I'll pass the pictures around</i>

02:57:14.884 --> 02:57:18.644
<i>Of all the years
that we stood there</i>

02:57:18.644 --> 02:57:23.121
<i>On the sidelines
wishing for right now</i>

02:57:24.256 --> 02:57:28.225
<i>We are
the kings and the queens</i>

02:57:28.225 --> 02:57:32.130
<i>You traded your baseball cap
for a crown</i>

02:57:34.233 --> 02:57:37.740
<i>When they gave us
our trophies</i>

02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:43.438
<i>And we held them up
for our town</i>

02:57:43.438 --> 02:57:46.947
<i>And the cynics were outraged</i>

02:57:48.115 --> 02:57:52.546
<i>Screaming, this is absurd</i>

02:57:52.546 --> 02:57:58.288
<i>'Cause for a moment
a band of thieves
in ripped-up jeans</i>

02:57:58.288 --> 02:58:03.458
<i>Got to rule the world</i>

02:58:03.458 --> 02:58:07.033
<i>Long live the walls
we crashed through</i>

02:58:07.033 --> 02:58:11.532
<i>How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you</i>

02:58:11.532 --> 02:58:16.405
<i>I was screaming
Long live
all the magic we made</i>

02:58:16.405 --> 02:58:22.048
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders
I'm not afraid</i>

02:58:22.048 --> 02:58:25.821
<i>Long live
all the mountains we moved</i>

02:58:25.821 --> 02:58:30.551
<i>I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you</i>

02:58:30.551 --> 02:58:35.292
<i>I was screaming
Long live
that look on your face</i>

02:58:35.292 --> 02:58:38.328
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders</i>

02:58:38.328 --> 02:58:42.695
<i>One day
we will be remembered</i>

02:58:46.602 --> 02:58:50.274
<i>Hold on
to spinning around</i>

02:58:50.274 --> 02:58:55.246
<i>Confetti falls to the ground</i>

02:58:55.246 --> 02:59:01.615
<i>May these memories
break our fall</i>

02:59:03.652 --> 02:59:06.620
<i>Will you take a moment</i>

02:59:08.822 --> 02:59:11.394
<i>Promise me this</i>

02:59:12.661 --> 02:59:16.498
<i>That you'll
stand by me forever</i>

02:59:16.498 --> 02:59:19.842
<i>But if, God forbid
Fate should step in</i>

02:59:22.143 --> 02:59:25.672
<i>And force us into a goodbye</i>

02:59:26.708 --> 02:59:29.709
<i>If you have children someday</i>

02:59:32.021 --> 02:59:34.857
<i>When they point
to the pictures</i>

02:59:36.652 --> 02:59:39.323
<i>Please tell them my name</i>

02:59:41.899 --> 02:59:46.396
<i>Tell them how
the crowds went wild</i>

02:59:46.396 --> 02:59:51.797
<i>Tell them how
I hope they shine</i>

02:59:51.797 --> 02:59:55.075
<i>Long live
the walls we crashed through</i>

02:59:55.075 --> 02:59:58.177
<i>I had the time of my life</i>

02:59:58.177 --> 03:00:00.740
<i>With you</i>

03:00:00.740 --> 03:00:04.810
<i>Long, long live
the walls we crashed through</i>

03:00:04.810 --> 03:00:09.320
<i>How the kingdom lights shined
just for me and you</i>

03:00:09.320 --> 03:00:14.193
<i>And I was screaming
Long live
all the magic we made</i>

03:00:14.193 --> 03:00:19.594
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders
I'm not afraid</i>

03:00:19.594 --> 03:00:23.433
<i>Singing long live
all the mountains we moved</i>

03:00:23.433 --> 03:00:28.537
<i>I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you</i>

03:00:28.537 --> 03:00:32.948
<i>And long, long live
the look on your face</i>

03:00:32.948 --> 03:00:36.446
<i>And bring on
all the pretenders</i>

03:00:36.446 --> 03:00:38.415
<i>One day</i>

03:00:40.452 --> 03:00:42.991
<i>We will be remembered</i>
