02:05.120 --> 02:07.400
Vincent, more soil!

02:07.440 --> 02:08.560
Aye aye, captain.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.280
- Do you think these
- on the outside

02:13.320 --> 02:15.080
- And these taller ones
- in the middle?

02:15.120 --> 02:16.520
I'm not really up on

02:16.521 --> 02:17.920
the latest hip gardening trends.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.220
Maybe we could alternate

02:19.221 --> 02:20.480
these with those...

02:21.640 --> 02:23.240
Wow,

02:23.280 --> 02:24.660
that bracelet really

02:24.661 --> 02:26.040
catches the sun, eh?

02:26.080 --> 02:28.080
Yeah, almost like it's glowing,

02:28.081 --> 02:30.080
which it's not.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.160
Why don't you ehh...

02:31.161 --> 02:32.200
Keep at this.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.800
I'll go get a hose.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.460
[Violetta] Now this,

02:48.461 --> 02:49.840
is much more civilized.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.120
I will not be seen

02:51.121 --> 02:52.360
doing icky manual labour,

02:52.400 --> 02:54.480
like some common servant.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.640
Neither will my friends.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.800
Right!

03:07.480 --> 03:08.696
Violetta's at the garden house.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.240
And the book is in there.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.680
- Did she go in?
- I don't know.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.776
- They must
- have just been assigned

03:12.800 --> 03:13.960
That spot for yard work.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.560
But I can't get past her.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.760
Diversion?

03:19.320 --> 03:21.160
How come you guys are always

03:21.161 --> 03:23.000
sneaking off like this?

03:23.040 --> 03:24.960
You think I don't notice?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.480
What?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.280
- Don't be silly.
- We're not "sneaking".

03:28.320 --> 03:30.136
- And it's not "always".
- We're just going to get...

03:30.160 --> 03:31.240
- Do.
- Get or do...

03:33.680 --> 03:35.080
- Something.
- Right.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.120
But Violetta,

03:44.121 --> 03:45.160
won't we get in trouble

03:45.200 --> 03:46.600
for not contributing?

03:48.480 --> 03:50.800
There, I contributed.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.160
Well done.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.720
[Vincent] Coming through!

03:54.760 --> 03:55.840
[Vincent] Watch out!

03:55.880 --> 03:57.960
Whole lotta soil here!

03:58.000 --> 03:59.140
- [Violetta] Why here?

03:59.141 --> 04:00.280
- Whoooooaa!

04:00.320 --> 04:01.536
- Hey! Watch
- where you're going with that!

04:01.560 --> 04:02.840
Whoooooaa!

04:02.880 --> 04:04.040
[gasps]

04:04.080 --> 04:05.200
NOOOO!

04:05.240 --> 04:07.560
Footwear crisis!

04:07.600 --> 04:09.016
- [Violetta's friend] That
- will come right off!

04:09.040 --> 04:10.280
Nooo!

04:10.320 --> 04:11.680
I need to sit somewhere else.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.000
Take me to that bench!

04:18.320 --> 04:19.920
[Vincent] No wait, ummm...

04:19.959 --> 04:21.480
ride in this!

04:21.519 --> 04:23.000
Violetta, Violetta!

04:24.520 --> 04:26.160
Look what I found in the soil

04:26.200 --> 04:27.840
that fell on your shoes.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.520
There's a worm in here.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.600
[gasps]

04:34.400 --> 04:35.800
You should be careful.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.200
There might be more of these.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.540
One might've even gotten

04:38.541 --> 04:39.840
into your shoes.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.680
I need a foot bath!

04:44.720 --> 04:46.240
- It might've
- already laid its eggs!

04:55.960 --> 04:58.840
Wow. That was kind of brilliant.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.960
Thanks.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.520
It's an old shoelace.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.700
I don't see what's so important

05:04.701 --> 05:06.080
in that house,

05:06.120 --> 05:07.560
but go ahead.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.080
I'll be right back!

05:26.040 --> 05:27.600
Say your password.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.860
"The reason elves

05:28.861 --> 05:30.080
must learn to fly,

05:30.120 --> 05:31.480
the answer lies

05:31.481 --> 05:32.840
where land meets sky."

05:46.280 --> 05:49.360
[screams]

05:53.640 --> 05:55.280
[Mo] Huh.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.740
This job doesn't get any easier,

05:56.741 --> 05:58.160
does it?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.120
[Yuko] Tell me about it.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.640
[sighs exhausted]

06:01.680 --> 06:03.040
There's way

06:03.041 --> 06:04.400
more ground to cover,

06:04.440 --> 06:06.080
and way less unicorn dust

06:06.081 --> 06:07.720
to cover it with.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.180
Panthea's like a disease

06:09.181 --> 06:10.600
in Centopia.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.480
And it's getting worse.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.560
[neighs]

06:27.120 --> 06:28.920
[Mo] It's okay, Onchao.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.340
[sighs]

06:30.341 --> 06:31.720
You've done enough for today.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.520
- Everything is withering away
- so fast,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.720
There's no way you can keep up.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.440
[neighs]

06:41.480 --> 06:42.560
Hi Mia!

06:46.000 --> 06:47.220
Salutations fellow elves.

06:47.221 --> 06:48.440
[giggles]

06:48.480 --> 06:51.560
Hey Onchao! Miss me?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.000
[neighs]

06:53.040 --> 06:54.640
Hi Mia.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.720
- We're trying
- to undo Panthea's handiwork.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.920
Gardening huh? How's it going?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.600
Not too good.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.616
- We're gonna run out of
- unicorn dust really fast

07:02.640 --> 07:04.360
If we don't get rid of Panthea.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.740
We just need the last five

07:05.741 --> 07:07.080
pieces of the Trumptus!

07:07.120 --> 07:08.420
I'm all for that.

07:08.421 --> 07:09.720
How's this for a start:

07:09.760 --> 07:11.200
"The reason elves

07:11.201 --> 07:12.640
must learn to fly,

07:12.680 --> 07:14.100
the answer lies

07:14.101 --> 07:15.520
where land meets sky."

07:15.560 --> 07:17.800
Where land meets sky...?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.060
Gargona!

07:30.061 --> 07:31.320
Where are those dragons going?!

07:31.360 --> 07:33.720
They've escaped, my Queen.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.120
Again?!

07:35.160 --> 07:36.576
- Take all
- your available troops...

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
And round up some more dragons!

07:38.640 --> 07:40.280
I want to obey, my Queen,

07:40.281 --> 07:41.920
but yesterday

07:41.960 --> 07:43.300
I checked the wild dragon

07:43.301 --> 07:44.640
nesting caves and...

07:44.680 --> 07:45.960
- uhm...

07:45.961 --> 07:47.240
- And?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.480
There were none there.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.740
Well then use your head

07:50.741 --> 07:51.960
and look somewhere else!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.020
What's the point

07:53.021 --> 07:54.040
in having a general

07:54.080 --> 07:55.460
if I have to do

07:55.461 --> 07:56.840
everything myself?

07:56.880 --> 07:58.460
Sometimes I think

07:58.461 --> 08:00.040
I should make Ziggo general,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.760
for all the good you do.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.200
Let's see.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.780
Wild dragons

08:07.781 --> 08:09.680
always follow the winds...

08:09.720 --> 08:13.160
so where do the winds begin?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.840
The Windy Cliffs!

08:14.841 --> 08:16.480
[laughs evilly]

08:19.400 --> 08:20.880
[Yuko] The Windy Cliffs.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.400
With cliffs that big,

08:22.440 --> 08:24.360
- it's definitely
- where land meets sky.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.600
Listen, guys.

08:25.601 --> 08:26.800
You better brace yourselves.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.776
- They don't call them
- the Windy Cliffs for nothing.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.900
You mean the wind

08:29.901 --> 08:31.000
gets stronger than this?!

08:31.040 --> 08:32.740
Compared to the Windy Cliffs,

08:32.741 --> 08:34.440
this is a light breeze.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.780
Okay, let's do this.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.080
All for one, and one for all!

08:39.120 --> 08:40.520
Okay...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.919
All for one, and one for all.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.200
[grunting] Aaahhh!

08:44.240 --> 08:46.040
[wind whistles]

08:48.240 --> 08:49.720
Whoaaaaaa!!!!

08:51.640 --> 08:52.960
Are you guys okay?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.720
[grunts]

08:54.760 --> 08:56.760
Absolutely fine!

08:56.800 --> 08:57.840
Don't worry about us!

08:57.841 --> 08:58.880
[grunts]

09:03.920 --> 09:05.000
[neighs]

09:05.040 --> 09:07.160
Muncs! Look out!

09:10.760 --> 09:12.280
[Yuko] Don't fire!

09:12.320 --> 09:13.640
They're wild dragons.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.880
Stay out of their way

09:14.920 --> 09:16.480
and they'll leave you alone.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.640
[Mia] Whaaaa!

09:18.680 --> 09:20.360
- Mia!
- Mia!

09:20.400 --> 09:21.440
Whooaaaa...

09:21.480 --> 09:22.600
Gotcha!

09:23.880 --> 09:25.280
Why are we stopping?

09:25.320 --> 09:26.696
- I was just getting
- the hang of it!

09:26.720 --> 09:29.000
You and Onchao should wait here.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.320
Why? Because of a little draft?!

09:31.360 --> 09:32.480
What about 'all for one,

09:32.481 --> 09:33.600
and one for all'?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.600
We can do this! Watch!

09:35.640 --> 09:37.280
It's too dangerous, Mia!

09:37.320 --> 09:39.560
- Yuko and I
- will find the Trumptus piece.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.360
I don't want you to get hurt.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.680
Stay here! Please.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.100
What are we supposed to do?

09:45.101 --> 09:46.480
Twiddle our thumbs?!

09:46.520 --> 09:48.160
[snorts]

09:48.200 --> 09:50.120
- [laughs] I know
- you don't have thumbs Onchao.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.840
It's just a figure of speech.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.280
[neighs]

09:55.320 --> 09:56.800
You can carry me?

09:56.840 --> 09:58.080
Okay!

09:58.081 --> 09:59.321
Let's show them what we can do!

10:01.920 --> 10:03.280
[Mia grunts]

10:03.320 --> 10:05.040
We can do it!

10:05.080 --> 10:06.320
Just...

10:06.360 --> 10:08.520
keep... flying...!

10:08.560 --> 10:09.960
Onchao!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.840
[neighs]

10:11.880 --> 10:13.480
Aaaaaaaaahhhh!

10:15.400 --> 10:16.880
[grunts with effort]

10:16.920 --> 10:17.960
[groans]

10:18.000 --> 10:19.320
Aaaaaahhhh...

10:24.480 --> 10:25.740
Ugh!

10:25.741 --> 10:27.000
Ouch!

10:29.840 --> 10:30.900
If this isn't

10:30.901 --> 10:31.960
where land meets sky,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.080
I don't know what is.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.680
Okay, you know what to do.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.160
[neigh]

10:39.240 --> 10:40.720
[wind blows strongly]

10:42.000 --> 10:44.280
Oh no! C'mon!

10:49.080 --> 10:50.280
[Yuko] Easy, boy.

10:50.281 --> 10:51.480
You're okay now.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.700
What are you doing here?

10:52.701 --> 10:53.880
Where's Mia?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.640
[neighs]

10:55.680 --> 10:58.040
- She didn't try to fly after us,
- did she?

10:58.080 --> 10:59.880
[neighs loudly]

10:59.920 --> 11:01.100
In these winds,

11:01.101 --> 11:02.280
she could've been blown

10:59.920 --> 11:02.280
anywhere!

11:08.560 --> 11:11.520
Ooww, my aching wings...

11:11.560 --> 11:13.120
where am I?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.280
[groans]

11:15.840 --> 11:17.360
I know I can fix this.

11:17.361 --> 11:18.880
A unicorn tear.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.280
Oh no! I'm all out.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.080
I hope Yuko has some.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.760
Where's my ring?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.200
Gardening.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.080
Oh, that's bad. Real bad!

11:33.120 --> 11:35.280
What am I gonna do?

11:35.320 --> 11:38.680
Hello! Is anybody there?!

11:38.720 --> 11:40.840
DING DING!

11:40.880 --> 11:42.480
Mia.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.680
Okay? That was weird. Try yours.

11:47.720 --> 11:48.800
DING!

11:48.840 --> 11:50.560
Mia.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.880
[grumbles]

11:51.920 --> 11:53.240
They've never done that before.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.680
That isn't good, right?!

11:57.360 --> 11:59.480
Okay. We jump into the winds

11:59.520 --> 12:00.620
and let them take us

12:00.621 --> 12:01.720
where they took Mia.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.920
WHAT!?

12:09.720 --> 12:11.600
Are you sure about this?

12:11.640 --> 12:12.800
On the count of three.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.480
One... two... three!

12:15.520 --> 12:17.280
[Yuko] WHOOOOOOA!

12:24.600 --> 12:25.660
I can't be that far

12:25.661 --> 12:26.720
from the cliffs.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.700
Face it Mia,

12:29.701 --> 12:31.240
you're completely lost.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.320
[snort]

12:32.360 --> 12:33.400
[gasps]

12:39.280 --> 12:40.760
[clears throat]

12:40.800 --> 12:41.880
Hello?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.520
It's okay! I'm just lost!

12:44.560 --> 12:46.040
- I was hoping
- maybe you could help.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.960
[sniffs]

12:51.880 --> 12:53.920
[neighing]

12:53.960 --> 12:56.480
Wait! Where're you going?!

12:56.520 --> 12:57.880
[neighs loudly]

12:58.960 --> 13:01.120
Danger? What danger?!

13:01.160 --> 13:02.520
[growl]

13:02.560 --> 13:03.880
Oh no.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.200
RAAAHRRRR!!

13:08.480 --> 13:09.800
[Yuko] I don't see her!

13:09.840 --> 13:11.000
Anywhere!

13:12.600 --> 13:14.120
[neighing]

13:14.160 --> 13:15.720
- The winds
- are too strong for Onchao!

13:22.240 --> 13:23.760
[Mo] Okay, Down!

13:25.400 --> 13:27.080
Whew. With these gusts,

13:27.120 --> 13:28.520
Mia could be anywhere by now.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.080
This wind is brutal.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.616
- It'd take a dragon
- to fly against it.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.800
[growl]

13:32.840 --> 13:34.360
[Yuko] Get down!

13:34.400 --> 13:35.640
Ugh.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.120
Me and my big mouth!

13:37.160 --> 13:39.000
Don't let him get away!

13:39.040 --> 13:40.760
I'm not leaving here,

13:40.761 --> 13:42.480
empty handed.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.880
Are you kidding me...?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.640
What's she doing here?

13:48.280 --> 13:50.520
Mo, look.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.820
That peak!

13:51.821 --> 13:53.080
It's higher than the others.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.120
Where land meets sky!

13:55.160 --> 13:56.200
You took the words

13:56.201 --> 13:57.240
right out of my mouth.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.080
[wild shrieking]

13:59.120 --> 14:01.440
- [Yuko] We gotta get up there.
- [Mo] I know, I know.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.700
But if we fly up there

14:02.701 --> 14:03.920
now we'll get caught.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.856
- We're just gonna have to
- wait for our chance.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.560
[snorts]

14:07.600 --> 14:09.320
- I don't know
- what you're saying Onchao,

14:09.360 --> 14:10.840
But if you're asking about Mia,

14:10.880 --> 14:13.000
I'm worried about her too.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.880
- But we gotta wait here
- till they're gone.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.240
RAAAHRRR

14:20.160 --> 14:21.380
Don't let it get away!

14:21.381 --> 14:22.600
[grouses]

14:22.640 --> 14:26.240
I am surrounded by imbeciles!

14:28.320 --> 14:29.360
[gasps deeply]

14:30.640 --> 14:32.080
- RAAAAAWWWRRR!
- Aaaaaaaaahhhh!

14:34.800 --> 14:36.120
[grunts]

14:36.160 --> 14:37.200
[gasps]

14:37.240 --> 14:38.520
[growls]

14:38.560 --> 14:40.080
[goes quiet abruptly]

14:41.320 --> 14:42.400
Huh?

14:44.640 --> 14:46.160
Wait a minute?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.560
Do I know you?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.120
Baby blue!

15:02.160 --> 15:03.560
It is you!

15:03.600 --> 15:06.000
Wow! You got big!

15:06.040 --> 15:08.720
Really, really big!

15:08.760 --> 15:10.220
I am so glad I ran into you.

15:10.221 --> 15:11.680
I need your help.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.600
We were flying

15:13.601 --> 15:15.480
to the windy cliffs and...

15:15.520 --> 15:17.120
Do you understand?

15:17.160 --> 15:19.440
Friends? Yuko and Mo...

15:19.480 --> 15:21.080
and Onchao?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.080
[roars slightly]

15:23.120 --> 15:24.240
That's it.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.480
Can you fly me to them?

15:25.520 --> 15:27.600
You know... Fly?

15:33.120 --> 15:34.460
Atta boy, Blue.

15:34.461 --> 15:35.800
You got the idea!

15:35.840 --> 15:37.520
Now fly off straight ahead.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.100
Boy! Onchao's gonna be happy

15:39.101 --> 15:40.640
to see you!

15:48.560 --> 15:51.560
We're here! The Windy Cliffs.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.880
Brace yourself!

15:57.640 --> 15:59.320
That's amazing!

15:59.360 --> 16:00.760
How do you do that?!

16:03.760 --> 16:05.240
I get it...

16:05.280 --> 16:06.480
you're riding the gusts,

16:06.520 --> 16:08.120
instead of fighting them!

16:08.160 --> 16:09.280
Cool!

16:12.920 --> 16:15.360
There they are! I see them!

16:15.400 --> 16:17.560
RAAAHHR!

16:17.600 --> 16:19.280
That dragon's got Mia!

16:19.320 --> 16:21.160
[neighs]

16:21.200 --> 16:22.680
Onchao! No!

16:27.520 --> 16:29.920
Onchao! It's okay!

16:29.960 --> 16:32.080
Don't you recognize this guy?!

16:33.960 --> 16:35.360
[roaring and neighing]

16:39.520 --> 16:40.800
It can't be!

16:40.840 --> 16:42.440
It's Baby Blue!

16:42.480 --> 16:44.560
Hang on!

16:44.600 --> 16:46.000
[Mia] Onchao!

16:46.040 --> 16:47.680
Blue, follow him!

16:49.800 --> 16:51.640
[Yuko] Woah!

16:51.680 --> 16:53.800
The winds are too strong!

16:53.840 --> 16:55.400
Maybe we can fly under them.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.560
C'mon!

16:58.800 --> 17:01.040
If you useless boneheads

17:01.080 --> 17:02.160
don't find something

17:02.161 --> 17:03.240
worth capturing

17:03.280 --> 17:05.040
by the time I count to three,

17:05.079 --> 17:07.240
I will personally feed you

17:07.241 --> 17:09.400
to the dragons myself!

17:11.200 --> 17:12.800
One...

17:12.839 --> 17:14.040
Two...

17:14.079 --> 17:15.400
[neigh]

17:18.160 --> 17:20.359
I see him too. I'm not blind.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.920
You again!

17:24.960 --> 17:26.400
And it looks like

17:26.440 --> 17:28.319
- you've been snatched
- by a dragon!

17:28.359 --> 17:30.600
Get the dragon and the elf!

17:30.640 --> 17:33.160
Leave the unicorn to me!

17:45.800 --> 17:46.840
[hisses]

17:49.680 --> 17:52.280
Argh! Come back here!

17:52.320 --> 17:53.360
[snorts]

18:01.000 --> 18:02.040
[sniffs]

18:03.920 --> 18:05.520
Blasted Winds!

18:05.560 --> 18:07.260
C'mon, you useless lizard!

18:07.261 --> 18:08.960
Faster!

18:14.880 --> 18:16.120
[neighs]

18:22.040 --> 18:23.280
[neighs]

18:23.320 --> 18:25.240
He's found the Trumptus piece!

18:25.280 --> 18:26.880
Good boy, Onchao!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.160
[groans]

18:32.200 --> 18:33.480
Aaaah!

18:33.520 --> 18:34.640
Gotcha!

18:34.641 --> 18:35.760
That was close.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.600
Onchao found the Trumptus piece!

18:42.280 --> 18:43.640
Ha, ha!

18:44.960 --> 18:46.280
[Gargona] Gotcha!

18:49.080 --> 18:50.240
Onchao!

18:50.280 --> 18:51.880
[laughs gleefully]

18:51.920 --> 18:54.800
Huh? Blasted winds!

18:57.880 --> 18:59.440
Double rescue!

18:59.480 --> 19:00.920
You take the baby dragon,

19:00.921 --> 19:02.360
I'll get Onchao!

19:02.400 --> 19:03.640
Wait, I can...

19:03.680 --> 19:04.960
[groans]

19:08.520 --> 19:11.000
Yuko! Throw me your necklace!

19:23.120 --> 19:24.640
[Gargona laughs]

19:24.680 --> 19:26.000
[Yuko] Get away from him,

19:26.040 --> 19:27.240
you evil, old crone!

19:29.040 --> 19:30.080
HAHAHA!

19:30.120 --> 19:31.360
Your water glares

19:31.400 --> 19:33.320
are no use up here!

19:35.400 --> 19:37.880
[grunts with effort]

19:37.920 --> 19:39.240
Woah!

19:47.360 --> 19:48.600
Ah!

19:49.480 --> 19:50.840
Better than new!

19:58.720 --> 20:00.420
I can't get to him!

20:00.421 --> 20:02.120
The winds are too strong!

20:02.160 --> 20:04.320
He's okay. Look!

20:08.120 --> 20:09.160
[shrieks]

20:15.400 --> 20:17.480
- [Yuko] He's doing just fine
- on his own.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.840
Bye, little big guy!

20:18.880 --> 20:20.120
[Mia] Aaaaaaahhh...

20:20.160 --> 20:21.800
I don't believe it!

20:21.840 --> 20:23.360
Ride with the gusts...

20:23.361 --> 20:24.880
don't fight them...

20:29.800 --> 20:30.880
How in the name

20:30.881 --> 20:31.960
of Panthea's mask

20:32.000 --> 20:33.280
did she do that?

20:35.120 --> 20:36.520
I've got you, Onchao!

20:36.560 --> 20:37.720
[neighs]

20:37.760 --> 20:38.840
[gasps]

20:38.880 --> 20:40.360
Well done boy!

20:41.360 --> 20:43.720
I don't think so.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.600
Let's get out of here!

20:47.640 --> 20:49.220
Hey!

20:49.221 --> 20:50.800
Get back here with my unicorn!

20:52.640 --> 20:54.320
Wow, great job!

20:54.360 --> 20:55.980
Alright...

20:55.981 --> 20:57.600
hand over the unicorn!

20:57.640 --> 20:58.760
You're forgetting one thing,

20:58.761 --> 20:59.880
Gargona.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.640
What's that?!

21:01.680 --> 21:03.800
There's no wind down here.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.200
[gasps]

21:07.240 --> 21:09.600
This isn't over yet!

21:10.800 --> 21:13.560
It will be soon! You'll see!

21:16.440 --> 21:18.080
How'd you fly like that?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.400
I got hints from an old friend.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.060
I guess I still feel strange

21:22.061 --> 21:23.680
having a dragon as a friend.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.560
- But friends stick together,
- right?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.120
Like you said,

21:27.121 --> 21:28.640
all for one, and one for all.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.640
Good work, Onchao.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.200
Somehow you always

21:36.201 --> 21:37.720
dig these pieces up.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.120
- Speaking of digging things up,
- I gotta get back.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.760
Leaving so soon?!

21:41.800 --> 21:44.280
- You're gonna
- miss riding the winds back home!

21:44.320 --> 21:45.700
I have find my ring

21:45.701 --> 21:47.080
before somebody else does.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.560
See you soon, guys!

21:48.600 --> 21:49.640
Bye Onchao.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.640
[Yuko] Race you home!

21:53.680 --> 21:55.000
[Mo] Hey! No fair!

21:55.040 --> 21:56.760
[Mo and Yuko laugh]

22:03.840 --> 22:05.560
Where is it?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.160
It has to be here!

22:14.360 --> 22:15.680
There you are.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.080
- You'll make
- a great king someday.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.600
[Vincent] Hey...

22:30.640 --> 22:31.960
That worm-tie thing...

22:32.000 --> 22:33.680
the great idea.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.280
- [Vincent] Kudos
- on the gross score.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.240
- Violetta's got a thing
- about gross.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.280
