WEBVTT

00:00.876 --> 00:01.627
<i>Previously on "Gilmore Girls.."</i>

00:01.669 --> 00:02.753
You haven't forgiven me.

00:02.795 --> 00:04.004
What are you talking about?

00:04.045 --> 00:05.464
For the girls I was with

00:04.045 --> 00:05.464
when we were separated.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.632
I said I forgive you.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.216
Yeah, you said it,

00:06.674 --> 00:08.216
but you haven't, though.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.135
I'll be out of cell phone

00:08.258 --> 00:10.135
range for a couple days.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.137
- I know.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.137
- I'll see you.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.431
Logan's hurt,

00:12.179 --> 00:14.431
something happened on the trip

00:14.473 --> 00:16.308
they're airlifting him

00:14.473 --> 00:16.308
to a hospital in New York.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.352
You can trust me that

00:16.350 --> 00:18.352
there will be no contact

00:18.393 --> 00:20.020
between you and Luke's

00:18.393 --> 00:20.020
daughter anytime soon.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.271
What does that mean?

00:21.313 --> 00:22.648
It means,

00:21.313 --> 00:22.648
that I don't even see her.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.525
Luke and I have

00:22.690 --> 00:24.525
an arrangement.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.109
(Lorelai)

00:24.566 --> 00:26.109
'This is the first one of Rory's

00:24.566 --> 00:26.109
friends to get married.'

00:26.151 --> 00:28.195
You know,

00:26.151 --> 00:28.195
Rory could be next.

00:28.236 --> 00:33.033
Okay, met April, took a picture

00:28.236 --> 00:33.033
together like you're pals.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.285
I swear, mom, it was

00:33.074 --> 00:35.285
a crazy coincidence.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.912
I'm not getting married.

00:36.954 --> 00:40.040
No, it ain't for me.

00:36.954 --> 00:40.040
It's not in the cards.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.209
Hey, do you know what date

00:40.081 --> 00:42.209
I'm not getting married?

00:42.250 --> 00:43.878
June 3rd.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.129
Who else here had eight shots

00:43.919 --> 00:46.129
of tequila? Anybody?

00:46.171 --> 00:49.257
Alright, Calamity Jane,

00:46.171 --> 00:49.257
let's get you to bed.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.720
No, Luke, it's fine.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.720
I'm glad you called.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.179
[sighs]

00:54.221 --> 00:55.389
Uh-huh.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.310
[sighs]

01:03.313 --> 01:05.482
Is there something long and

01:03.313 --> 01:05.482
sharp sticking out of my head?

01:05.524 --> 01:07.108
- No.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.108
- I want there to be.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.986
There's an effect.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.986
I need a cause.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.363
The cause was ten giant shots

01:09.028 --> 01:11.363
of tequila, sweetie.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.156
It makes me woozy

01:11.405 --> 01:13.156
just hearing that.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.616
Well, that's

01:13.198 --> 01:14.616
the price you pay

01:14.658 --> 01:15.993
for being the hit

01:14.658 --> 01:15.993
of Lane's wedding.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.870
Hit? I was

01:16.035 --> 01:17.870
a raving lunatic.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.329
And that toast..

01:19.371 --> 01:20.581
[pan bangs]

01:19.371 --> 01:20.581
Oh, my God!

01:20.622 --> 01:21.623
- Loudest sound ever.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.623
- 'Sorry.'

01:21.665 --> 01:23.250
Don't worry

01:21.665 --> 01:23.250
about the toast

01:23.291 --> 01:25.711
and you weren't a lunatic,

01:23.291 --> 01:25.711
you were a character.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.004
(Sookie) 'I mean,

01:25.753 --> 01:27.004
what is Stars Hollow if not'

01:27.046 --> 01:29.006
'a haven for colorful

01:27.046 --> 01:29.006
characters?'

01:29.048 --> 01:30.424
I mean, you're not up there

01:29.048 --> 01:30.424
with Stevie the..

01:30.465 --> 01:32.091
...pantsless Santa Claus

01:32.133 --> 01:34.428
or Jojo the cow whisperer,

01:32.133 --> 01:34.428
but you made some strides.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.179
Is this supposed to be

01:34.469 --> 01:36.179
a consolation?

01:36.221 --> 01:37.723
[pan bangs]

01:36.221 --> 01:37.723
That's twice

01:36.221 --> 01:37.723
in 20 seconds, Fred.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.307
Sorry.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.851
I've seen you wasted before

01:39.349 --> 01:40.851
but never like this.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.770
I mean, we had

01:40.893 --> 01:42.770
you guzzling coffee

01:42.811 --> 01:45.522
but coffee was making you

01:42.811 --> 01:45.522
energetically wasted.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.982
I should borrow

01:45.564 --> 01:46.982
the reception video

01:47.024 --> 01:49.068
to see what a fool,

01:47.024 --> 01:49.068
I made out of myself.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.652
- And check out your audition.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.652
- My what?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.905
[pan bangs]

01:50.694 --> 01:52.905
You want a piece of me,

01:50.694 --> 01:52.905
omelet boy?

01:52.947 --> 01:55.032
Fred, why don't you let the

01:52.947 --> 01:55.032
vegetables simmer for a while?

01:55.074 --> 01:56.491
I'll-I'll, look after them.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.326
Sure, Sookie.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.747
Sorry, Fred.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.747
I'm not myself this morning.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.124
So, now, what did I do

02:01.789 --> 02:04.124
in front of the camera?

02:04.165 --> 02:05.584
Well, when you spotted

02:04.165 --> 02:05.584
the videographer

02:05.626 --> 02:07.377
you got suddenly

02:05.626 --> 02:07.377
very excited

02:07.419 --> 02:10.047
to film your audition tape

02:07.419 --> 02:10.047
for "America's Next Top Model."

02:10.089 --> 02:11.506
- Oh, my God!

02:10.089 --> 02:11.506
- 'Yeah.'

02:11.548 --> 02:13.341
- I thought that was a dream.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.341
- It wasn't.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.636
The posing, the strutting,

02:13.383 --> 02:15.636
the inappropriate gyrating?

02:15.677 --> 02:17.262
All caught on video

02:15.677 --> 02:17.262
and several of

02:17.304 --> 02:18.889
Zack's buddies' camera phones.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.641
- Why didn't you stop me?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.641
- I tried.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.350
We all tried,

02:20.682 --> 02:22.350
but you were on a mission.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.104
You kept saying, "I'm not here

02:22.392 --> 02:25.104
to make friends. I want to win."

02:25.145 --> 02:26.563
And then after that..

02:26.605 --> 02:28.148
There's an "after that?"

02:28.189 --> 02:30.358
You tried to start

02:28.189 --> 02:30.358
a limbo contest, a poker game

02:30.400 --> 02:33.737
and a secret club for

02:30.400 --> 02:33.737
super cool party people only.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.572
None of those things really,

02:33.779 --> 02:35.572
you know, took off.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.407
Especially the limbo

02:35.614 --> 02:37.407
considering your

02:37.449 --> 02:39.159
choice of limbo stick

02:37.449 --> 02:39.159
was Zack's..

02:39.200 --> 02:40.201
(in unison)

02:39.200 --> 02:40.201
Great uncle's cane.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.912
Oh, yeah, is he okay?

02:41.954 --> 02:44.623
He's stumbled, but we caught

02:41.954 --> 02:44.623
him. He's fine.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.208
So, is that all? Anything else

02:44.665 --> 02:47.208
I need to know about?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.669
Nope, after you crowned yourself

02:48.710 --> 02:50.754
arm wrestling champion

02:48.710 --> 02:50.754
of the world

02:50.796 --> 02:53.214
Christopher and Rory scooped

02:50.796 --> 02:53.214
you up and got you home.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.050
- He got you in bed okay?

02:53.256 --> 02:55.050
- Christopher?

02:55.092 --> 02:56.551
Yeah, well, he and Rory.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.471
He's very knight in

02:56.593 --> 02:59.471
shining armor, very chivalrous.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.180
That's him.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.851
So, um, is there anything else

03:01.222 --> 03:03.851
I did that I need to know about?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.936
- I wanna be fully informed.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.936
- I told you everything.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.562
Good, now, if you'll excuse me

03:07.604 --> 03:09.356
I'm gonna go and be nauseous

03:07.604 --> 03:09.356
out front for a while.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.901
Excellent, super cool party

03:09.397 --> 03:12.901
people bid you supercool adieu.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.904
That's how you were

03:14.736 --> 03:15.904
saying goodbye

03:15.946 --> 03:16.947
to people at the wedding.

03:16.989 --> 03:17.948

Excuse me, I'm looking

04:16.715 --> 04:18.759
for Logan Huntzberger.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.928
He's...excuse me,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.928
can you help me find Logan

04:20.969 --> 04:22.930
Sorry, this isn't my floor.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.307
Excuse me, can someone here

04:22.971 --> 04:26.307
help me find Logan Huntzberger?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.977
He was just transferred

04:26.349 --> 04:28.977
out of the ICU, room 713.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.270
- How is he?

04:29.019 --> 04:30.270
- Are you family?

04:30.311 --> 04:31.980
I'm his girlfriend.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.607
All I can tell you is that

04:32.022 --> 04:33.607
he's not conscious right now

04:33.648 --> 04:35.734
and that he's in serious

04:33.648 --> 04:35.734
but stable condition.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.444
What does that mean

04:35.776 --> 04:37.444
"serious but stable?"

04:37.485 --> 04:39.780
- Just what it says.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.780
- Is it more serious or stable?

04:39.821 --> 04:40.948
Which way is it leaning?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.282
I'm sorry, I can only release

04:42.323 --> 04:44.076
more information

04:42.323 --> 04:44.076
to family members.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.870
But I'm his girlfriend. I mean,

04:44.118 --> 04:46.870
we've been together a long time.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.789
It's not a casual thing.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.789
We live together.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.791
Sorry.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.085
(female #1 on PA)

04:50.832 --> 04:53.085
'Dr. Martina,

04:50.832 --> 04:53.085
please report to emergency.'

04:53.127 --> 04:55.212
'Dr. Martina, please report..'

04:55.254 --> 04:56.421
How is he?

04:55.254 --> 04:56.421
Is he okay?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.714
Scuttlebutt is

04:56.463 --> 04:57.714
he's not dead.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.174
The man

04:57.756 --> 04:59.174
is indestructible.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.842
Dives headfirst

04:59.216 --> 05:00.842
off the cliffs of caldera

05:00.884 --> 05:02.385
instantly spins

05:00.884 --> 05:02.385
out of control.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.554
Gets totally disoriented,

05:02.427 --> 05:04.554
barely gets his chute open.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.514
(Finn)

05:04.596 --> 05:06.514
'Bounces off every rock

05:04.596 --> 05:06.514
and crag in the park.'

05:06.556 --> 05:07.849
Yet still manages

05:06.556 --> 05:07.849
to stick the landing.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.601
We gave him a 9.7.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.145
Had to deduct three tenth's for

05:09.643 --> 05:11.145
all the screaming and bleeding.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.687
What about his family?

05:11.186 --> 05:12.687
Did you talk to them?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.022
Honor is on

05:12.729 --> 05:14.022
her honeymoon in Mykonos

05:14.064 --> 05:15.774
trying to get

05:14.064 --> 05:15.774
a flight back

05:15.816 --> 05:17.818
and Logan's mom checked herself

05:15.816 --> 05:17.818
into some sort of spa in Arizona

05:17.859 --> 05:19.444
the moment she heard.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.988
When the going gets tough,

05:19.486 --> 05:20.988
the tough get hot-rock massages.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.697
What about Mitchum?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.574
The dark lord, we left word but

05:22.739 --> 05:24.574
haven't heard anything back.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.285
But we've come up

05:24.616 --> 05:26.285
with a plan

05:26.326 --> 05:28.578
to get around the whole "family

05:26.326 --> 05:28.578
only gets information" thing.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.038
- We're adopting him.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.038
- What?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.372
(Finn)

05:30.080 --> 05:31.372
'Logan will make

05:30.080 --> 05:31.372
a fine son.'

05:31.414 --> 05:32.874
Of course, first

05:31.414 --> 05:32.874
we must be married.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.751
Naturally, darling.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.751
I'm very old-fashioned.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.878
And even then, adopting as

05:34.793 --> 05:36.878
a gay couple is never easy.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.005
We just wanna

05:36.920 --> 05:38.005
give love.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.881
- Oh, Finn.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.881
- Oh, Buttercup.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.549
What the hell

05:39.923 --> 05:41.549
is wrong with you two?

05:41.591 --> 05:44.011
Your best friend is lying

05:41.591 --> 05:44.011
unconscious in a hospital.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.180
- And you don't even care.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.180
- Rory.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.098
Why the hell aren't you two

05:46.221 --> 05:48.098
lying unconscious in there, huh?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.641
- Come on.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.641
- 'You don't care.'

05:49.683 --> 05:51.185
Because if you did,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.185
you wouldn't be like this.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.436
You couldn't. You're

05:51.226 --> 05:53.436
supposed to have his back.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.896
You're supposed

05:53.478 --> 05:54.896
to watch out for each other

05:54.938 --> 05:56.564
on these stupid

05:54.938 --> 05:56.564
trips of yours.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.484
But no, everything's a big joke.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.484
Everything's hilarious.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.278
You're useless.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.278
Just go home.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.697
Both of you, go home.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.697
I can't stand to look at you.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.083
- Hi.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.083
- Hello.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.710
I'm Rory Gilmore.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.710
I'm his girlfriend.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.419
I'm Dr. Schultz.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.714
Um, how is he?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.714
Is he gonna be okay?

06:20.755 --> 06:23.842
I'm sorry, but I really

06:20.755 --> 06:23.842
can't get into the specifics.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.427
But, well, he's out of the ICU,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.427
so that's good, right?

06:26.469 --> 06:27.470
They wouldn't have

06:26.469 --> 06:27.470
moved him up here

06:27.512 --> 06:29.264
unless he was recovering.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.099
I'm sorry, really.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.809
But he's had surgery, right?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.809
Does he need more surgery?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.228
Does he have broken bone.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.064
Because I can

06:34.269 --> 06:37.064
donate blood if you want.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.899
You really,

06:37.105 --> 06:38.899
you-you can't tell me

06:38.940 --> 06:41.068
anything about what

06:38.940 --> 06:41.068
he has or what you've done

06:41.109 --> 06:42.819
or what's wrong, anything?

06:42.861 --> 06:44.487
I'm sorry.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.487
It's hospital policy.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.907
We're doing

06:44.529 --> 06:46.907
everything we can.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.116

Caesar, why am I still

07:29.408 --> 07:32.369
finding bananas in the fridge?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.329
Oh, you wanted me to take all

07:32.411 --> 07:34.329
the bananas out of the fridge?

07:34.371 --> 07:35.789
Yes, when I said,

07:34.371 --> 07:35.789
"remove the bananas."

07:35.830 --> 07:37.374
I was referring

07:35.830 --> 07:37.374
to<i> all</i> the bananas.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.792
Otherwise, I would

07:37.416 --> 07:38.792
have said a banana

07:38.833 --> 07:40.001
or some of the bananas.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.544
- Hmm.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.544
- What?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.213
It's just that

07:41.586 --> 07:43.213
while I was running the place

07:43.255 --> 07:45.090
that was one of

07:43.255 --> 07:45.090
my innovations cold bananas.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.507
People really love 'em.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.760
I highly doubt that.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.760
And get rid of those scones.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.928
You know, that's

07:48.802 --> 07:49.928
something else

07:49.970 --> 07:51.263
I wanted to talk

07:49.970 --> 07:51.263
to you about, Luke.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.597
- What?

07:51.305 --> 07:52.597
- Your attitude.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.308
See, while I

07:52.639 --> 07:54.308
was running the place

07:54.349 --> 07:56.601
people really responded

07:54.349 --> 07:56.601
to my sunny demeanor.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.561
Customers find you

07:56.643 --> 07:58.561
cold and distant.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
Service with a smile

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
it's a<i> cliche</i> for a reason.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.900
Yeah, look, Caesar,

08:00.605 --> 08:03.900
I don't want to improve things

08:03.942 --> 08:05.777
and I don't wanna stop

08:03.942 --> 08:05.777
being cold to customers.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.988
I just want you to keep my damn

08:05.819 --> 08:07.988
bananas out of the damn fridge

08:08.029 --> 08:10.115
I want to keep my damn doughnuts

08:08.029 --> 08:10.115
in the damn doughnut case.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.908
- Can you do that for me?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.908
- Of course, Luke.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.618
Thank you.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.620
Customers don't care for

08:13.660 --> 08:15.620
gratuitous profanity, either.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.749
Ah, thank God,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.749
someone sane.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.626
Hello, weary traveler.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.961
- It's good to be back.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.961
- Mm-hmm.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.005
You look older, wiser.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.631
Well, I did spend

08:25.046 --> 08:26.631
a lot of time

08:26.673 --> 08:28.425
squinting at

08:26.673 --> 08:28.425
historical documents.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.177
That's what it is

08:28.467 --> 08:30.177
constitution face.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.262
- Hi, Patty.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.262
- I brought you something.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.806
Aw, did you steal me

08:32.304 --> 08:34.806
the constitution?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.766
'Cause that could be the start

08:34.848 --> 08:36.766
of a really dumb movie.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.018
It's from Amish country.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.145
These little Amish girls

08:38.059 --> 08:40.145
handmake them.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.938
Aw, it's adorable.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.898
Look, Patty,

08:41.980 --> 08:43.898
an Amish voodoo doll.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.442
I love it.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.527
Hey, Luke, I'm still

08:45.484 --> 08:47.527
waiting on my cold banana.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.654
Uh, we don't serve cold bananas.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.654
It's not a voodoo doll.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.781
It's just the doll

08:49.696 --> 08:51.781
the Amish don't put faces

08:51.823 --> 08:53.658
on their dolls or pins in them.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.910
Oh, well, ha, ha,

08:53.700 --> 08:55.910
it's my doll now.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.578
What the Amish don't know

08:55.952 --> 08:57.578
won't hurt them.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.414
Unless, of course,

08:57.620 --> 08:59.414
I want to hurt them.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.500
It's yours to do

08:59.456 --> 09:01.500
with what you will.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.002
So, you seem surprisingly rested

09:01.541 --> 09:04.002
after all you've been through.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.670
Yeah, the kids were okay.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.381
They seemed to like me,

09:05.712 --> 09:07.381
unless they were all lying.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.798
Kids never lie.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.717
And April and I finally

09:08.840 --> 09:10.717
got into a good rhythm.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.011
She was tolerating me

09:10.758 --> 09:13.011
pretty good at the end.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.388
And guess what,

09:13.053 --> 09:14.388
it's her birthday tomorrow

09:14.429 --> 09:15.889
and I'm throwing her a party.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.724
You're kidding.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.724
How did that happen?

09:17.765 --> 09:19.393
Well, I was dropping

09:17.765 --> 09:19.393
her off this morning

09:19.434 --> 09:21.353
and her mom mentioned to me

09:19.434 --> 09:21.353
that she was taking her

09:21.395 --> 09:23.021
to her grandmother's

09:21.395 --> 09:23.021
to celebrate

09:23.063 --> 09:25.399
and she couldn't swing

09:23.063 --> 09:25.399
a party here with her friends

09:25.440 --> 09:27.108
so I figured

09:25.440 --> 09:27.108
I know her friends now.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.152
I got a great place

09:27.150 --> 09:29.152
to hold a party.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.987
- Yeah, where?

09:29.194 --> 09:30.987
- 'Here.'

09:31.029 --> 09:32.613
- Oh.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.613
- So, anyhow, there you go.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.657
Look at you,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.657
diving into fatherhood.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.784
- Yeah, I'm doing my best.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.784
- So, tomorrow, huh?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.453
- You prepared for all that?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.453
- Sure. Why?

09:38.495 --> 09:40.163
Well, if you need a consultant

09:40.205 --> 09:42.957
I have thrown some rockin'

09:40.205 --> 09:42.957
preteen parties in my time.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.001
Of course, I didn't have

09:42.999 --> 09:45.001
a deep fryer, but..

09:45.043 --> 09:47.254
I think I can handle it.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.254
I'll put up some decorations.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.256
I've ordered some balloons.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.256
I got a great cake place.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.965
- There will be presents.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.965
- All good.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.428
I'm just saying that Rory's

09:51.007 --> 09:54.428
birthday scavenger hunt of 1998

09:54.469 --> 09:57.389
is still talked about

09:54.469 --> 09:57.389
in hushed, reverent tones.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.974
Is that the one where all

09:57.431 --> 09:59.974
the kids ended up at Taylor's

10:00.016 --> 10:02.394
at 11 o'clock at night stealing

10:00.016 --> 10:02.394
stuff out of his fridge?

10:02.436 --> 10:03.978
Shh, hushed,

10:02.436 --> 10:03.978
reverent tones.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.398
Yeah, I've got it

10:04.020 --> 10:06.398
all under control.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.566
'Excuse me.'

10:08.733 --> 10:09.984
What can I get

10:08.733 --> 10:09.984
you, Kirk?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.571
How about a steaming cup

10:10.026 --> 10:12.571
of chicory coffee?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.947
It's not on the menu, Kirk.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.115
I know, it's on the sign.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.658
That's a mistake.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.994
Well, now all I can think about

10:17.700 --> 10:19.994
is chicory coffee.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.163
I'm very susceptible to signage.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.373
Well, come back

10:22.205 --> 10:23.373
when you're susceptible

10:23.415 --> 10:24.458
to ordering off the menu.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.751
You want anything?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.878
How about a nice plate

10:26.793 --> 10:28.878
of chicken fingers?

10:28.920 --> 10:29.921
[sighs]

10:28.920 --> 10:29.921
Oh.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.883
Why don't I start you off

10:31.590 --> 10:33.883
with some coffee, hmm?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.595
Uh, no, thanks.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.595
I'm kind of coffee'd out.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.389
Oh, right.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.389
Battling the hangover.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.600
Oh, did I mention

10:39.431 --> 10:41.600
my hangover?

Belted it out?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.084
to sing "Endless Love?"

11:08.126 --> 11:09.544
You know, if you're

11:08.126 --> 11:09.544
not gonna really belt it out

Okay, I've already gotten

11:21.222 --> 11:22.974

11:21.222 --> 11:22.974
the "Endless Love" story.

Aw, thanks.

He and his buddies went on some

12:19.280 --> 12:21.824
Life and Death Brigade trip

and they parachuted off

12:24.952 --> 12:26.162

12:26.204 --> 12:28.122

'He's out of the ICU,

12:28.164 --> 12:30.875

- Hello?

13:46.825 --> 13:48.411
- Here's the deal.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.204
He was bleeding internally

13:48.453 --> 13:50.204
when they brought him in

13:50.246 --> 13:52.165
and they were worried about

13:50.246 --> 13:52.165
the oxygen levels in his blood

13:52.206 --> 13:54.584
but he's stabilized now,

13:52.206 --> 13:54.584

13:54.626 --> 13:56.210
so that's no longer

13:54.626 --> 13:56.210

13:56.252 --> 13:58.171
He was also running

13:56.252 --> 13:58.171
a high fever

13:58.212 --> 14:01.090
so they put him on<i> mondo</i> doses

13:58.212 --> 14:01.090

14:05.512 --> 14:08.097

14:08.139 --> 14:09.848
He had surgery for the lung,

14:08.139 --> 14:09.848
and that went well.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.476
They did a thoracoscopy

14:11.518 --> 14:13.520
which is a couple of small

14:11.518 --> 14:13.520
incisions in the chest.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.979

14:17.816 --> 14:19.859
than a thoracotomy.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.211

15:20.253 --> 15:21.838
Oh.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.257
I will say,

15:21.880 --> 15:24.257

15:24.298 --> 15:25.966

15:30.054 --> 15:32.807
Not really, but I liked how much

15:30.054 --> 15:32.807
you liked it, so I bought it.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.350
Huh.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.895
And I will wear it because

15:34.392 --> 15:36.895
I know that every time I do

15:36.936 --> 15:38.396
you'll notice

15:36.936 --> 15:38.396

15:38.438 --> 15:40.147
and that will

15:38.438 --> 15:40.147
make me feel so good.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.566
And then because

15:40.189 --> 15:41.566
I feel so good

15:41.608 --> 15:43.317
I'll start wearing it

15:41.608 --> 15:43.317
more and more

15:43.359 --> 15:45.236
and I'll eventually

15:43.359 --> 15:45.236
really grow to like it

15:45.278 --> 15:48.114
and I'll forget that I didn't

15:45.278 --> 15:48.114
like it in the first place.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.624
the 5-year-old Dixie cup

15:57.665 --> 15:59.709
you use to hold your

15:57.665 --> 15:59.709
toothbrush, it's historical.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.753
I mean, as a birthday present

15:59.751 --> 16:01.753
for April.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.088
- April who?

16:01.795 --> 16:04.088
- Come on, it's cute.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.215
Um, yeah. I don't think

16:04.130 --> 16:06.215
it's quite right.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.842
(Luke)

16:06.257 --> 16:07.842
'It's girly.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.842
It's got cats on it.'

16:07.884 --> 16:09.302
Oh, well,

16:07.884 --> 16:09.302
if it's got cats on it.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.095
April likes cats.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.973
Yeah, but it's a toiletry kit.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.973
It's so hygienic.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.767
I saw her use soap

16:14.014 --> 16:15.767
on the trip.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.727
Yeah, did you see her

16:15.809 --> 16:17.727
tie her shoelaces?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.270
'Cause you could

16:17.769 --> 16:19.270
get her shoelaces?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.815
- I think she'll like it.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.815
- Luke, it's weird.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.442
It says, "Happy birthday,

16:21.856 --> 16:24.442
now go clean yourself up."

16:24.484 --> 16:26.861
Uh, if she doesn't like it,

16:24.484 --> 16:26.861
I'll get her a follow-up gift.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.822
Why not just get her

16:26.903 --> 16:28.822
the perfect gift right up front?

16:28.863 --> 16:30.531
Oh, why couldn't that be

16:28.863 --> 16:30.531
the perfect gift?

16:30.573 --> 16:31.991
- You don't know.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.991
- I know girls.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.409
It's not the right gift.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.286
Hey, you know, there's

16:33.451 --> 16:35.286
a store a few blocks down

16:35.328 --> 16:36.746
that has great stuff.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.581
I could take you there

16:36.788 --> 16:38.581
and show you 50 things

16:38.623 --> 16:41.125
I know she'd like. Some of them

16:38.623 --> 16:41.125
may even have cats on them.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.877
- I think I'm gonna get that.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.877
- Come on, Luke.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.671
I can really help you here.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.297
I'm not saying you can't,

16:44.712 --> 16:46.297
I know you're an expert, but..

16:46.339 --> 16:48.132
...I need to do this.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.469
Then do it. I'm just saying,

16:48.174 --> 16:51.469
let me be part of it.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.388
- No.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.388
- Why?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.099
- 'Because it's too soon.'

16:54.430 --> 16:57.099
- Why is it too soon?

16:57.141 --> 16:59.143
Because the minute

16:57.141 --> 16:59.143
you get involved in her life

16:59.185 --> 17:00.478
it'll be all over for me.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.189
What? That's ridiculous.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.941
No, it's not ridiculous.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.776
You're colorful and funny.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.402
You're practically

17:06.818 --> 17:08.402
a cartoon character.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.154
Kids love you.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.490
'I wouldn't hang out with me

17:10.196 --> 17:12.490
either after meeting you.'

17:12.532 --> 17:14.158
- Luke.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.158
- She'll like you better.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.703
- That is just a fact.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.703
- No, you're her dad.

17:16.744 --> 17:20.331
Yes, I am her dad, and this

17:16.744 --> 17:20.331
is the way I want it to be.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.458
- Okay.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.458
- I'll be a couple of minutes.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.501
I'll be right here.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.466
So, you got my cell phone

17:29.007 --> 17:30.466
if there's any problem?

17:30.508 --> 17:31.885
I've got your cell number,

17:30.508 --> 17:31.885
your store number

17:31.926 --> 17:33.219
your store fax number,

17:31.926 --> 17:33.219
your home number.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.388
- You are 100% reachable.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.388
- Good.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
And, hey, thanks again

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
for letting me do this.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.976
Oh, please.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.976
She's excited about this.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.853
Plus, your chaperoning

17:40.018 --> 17:41.853
got rave reviews.

17:41.895 --> 17:42.896
Really?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.355
April said you were by far

17:44.397 --> 17:45.857
the least embarrassing

17:44.397 --> 17:45.857
parent on the trip.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.775
Good. That's good, right?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.695
It's a rave.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.695
Her friends call you Hagrid.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.365
Really? Hagrid. Wow.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.365
I don't know what that means.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.075
He's a character

17:54.407 --> 17:56.075
from "Harry Potter"

17:56.116 --> 17:58.578
very big, very hairy,

17:56.116 --> 17:58.578
very lovable.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.079
'It's a huge compliment.'

18:00.120 --> 18:02.206
Oh, I will take

18:00.120 --> 18:02.206
your word for it.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.751
So, I'm gonna go now.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.168
Have fun, and I'll talk

18:04.792 --> 18:06.168
to you later tonight.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.837
- Will do.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.837
- I'm going, April.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.338
Yeah, yeah, bye, mom.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.757
- That was from the heart.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.757
- Totally.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.133
[laughing]

18:10.798 --> 18:13.133
Bye again.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.177
And the diner

18:13.175 --> 18:15.177
looks really great.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.055
I was here when you opened it,

18:15.219 --> 18:17.055
remember?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.472
I remember.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.682
- Bye.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.682
- 'Bye.'

18:23.143 --> 18:26.480
Okay, can I get everyone's

18:23.143 --> 18:26.480
attention for a moment here?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.982
Just go ahead

18:26.522 --> 18:27.982
and pull your chairs around

18:28.024 --> 18:29.233
uh, so everyone can see me.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.484
Hey, is this a game?

18:30.526 --> 18:31.778
(Luke)

18:30.526 --> 18:31.778
'No, no games right now.'

18:31.819 --> 18:33.320
Just gather.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.573
'Alright, I'm Luke.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.573
Hi, some of you know me.'

18:35.615 --> 18:36.699
I'm April's dad.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.701
[cheers and applause]

18:40.286 --> 18:44.123
So, um, uh, before we get

18:40.286 --> 18:44.123
the party started

18:44.164 --> 18:47.001
I just wanted to, uh,

18:44.164 --> 18:47.001
lay down some ground rules

18:47.043 --> 18:48.962
some simple dos and don'ts

18:49.003 --> 18:52.799
so that everybody has a good

18:49.003 --> 18:52.799
time and goes home in one piece.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.092
[clears throat]

18:52.840 --> 18:54.092
Okay.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.468
So..

18:55.509 --> 18:58.137
...uh, this is the party area.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.557
You are to remain

18:58.178 --> 19:01.557
in the party area at all times.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.726
The kitchen

19:01.599 --> 19:03.726
is strictly off limits.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.980
Under no circumstances

19:03.768 --> 19:06.980
are you to enter the kitchen.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.773
It's incredibly dangerous

19:07.021 --> 19:08.773
back there.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.025
'One turn of the wrong dial,

19:08.815 --> 19:11.025
you could burn your face off.'

19:11.067 --> 19:12.568
'And I've got

19:11.067 --> 19:12.568
so many knives back there'

19:12.610 --> 19:14.821
'you so much as trip,

19:12.610 --> 19:14.821
you could lose an arm.'

19:14.862 --> 19:15.905
'You could chop off

19:14.862 --> 19:15.905
a bunch of fingers.'

19:15.947 --> 19:16.948
'You could poke out an eye.'

19:16.990 --> 19:19.158
And do not go upstairs.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.285
That is not part

19:19.199 --> 19:21.285
of the party area.

19:21.327 --> 19:25.123
Everyone must remain

19:21.327 --> 19:25.123
in the party area at all times.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.667
And finally, do not go outside.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.670
I will not give anybody

19:27.708 --> 19:30.670
permission to go outside, okay?

19:30.711 --> 19:31.879
Are we clear?

19:31.921 --> 19:34.548
- Alright.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.548
- Yes, sir.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.135
Well, good, then-then that's

19:34.590 --> 19:37.135
all I've got. So have fun.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.013
Uh-huh.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.221
[indistinct chattering]

19:44.600 --> 19:46.393
- Is that our website?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.393
- It is.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.604
What happened to it?

19:48.646 --> 19:50.898
I made some modifications.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.733
It's just

19:50.940 --> 19:52.733
a big picture of you.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.862
Well, I figured since I'm the

19:52.775 --> 19:55.862
one who put the website together

19:55.903 --> 19:59.115
and I'm the one continuously

19:55.903 --> 19:59.115
updating the website

19:59.157 --> 20:02.702
then I should be featured

19:59.157 --> 20:02.702
prominently on the website.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
- Featured? Sure.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
- But where's the inn?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.539
- All I see is your face.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.539
- Uh-huh.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.291
But if you want to hear about

20:06.580 --> 20:09.291
the inn, you click on my mouth.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.752
See, and if you

20:09.333 --> 20:11.752
want pictures of the inn

20:11.794 --> 20:13.629
you click on my eyes.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.756
And if you want to post

20:13.671 --> 20:15.756
something about the inn

20:15.798 --> 20:18.384
you click on my ears.

20:18.425 --> 20:19.969
Clever, no?

20:20.011 --> 20:22.055
Do you wanna argue

20:20.011 --> 20:22.055
about this now or later?

20:22.096 --> 20:23.514
Later, I'm having

20:22.096 --> 20:23.514
too much fun.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.724
[cell phone rings]

20:26.017 --> 20:27.560
- Hello.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.560
- 'It's me.'

20:27.601 --> 20:29.228
Oh, hey, how is he?

20:29.269 --> 20:32.565
Well, I'm told he's going to be

20:29.269 --> 20:32.565
fine, but he looks awful

20:32.606 --> 20:34.567
and he's been unconscious

20:32.606 --> 20:34.567
the whole time I've been here.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.569
- It's really scary.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.569
- Aw, what happened?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.071
(Rory)

20:36.610 --> 20:38.071
'He basically

20:36.610 --> 20:38.071
jumped off a cliff'

20:38.112 --> 20:39.530
'and his parachute

20:38.112 --> 20:39.530
barely opened.'

20:39.572 --> 20:40.781
- Oh, my God.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.781
- Yeah.

20:40.823 --> 20:44.368
He has six broken ribs,

20:40.823 --> 20:44.368
a collapsed lung

20:44.410 --> 20:47.080
a broken ankle, contusions

20:44.410 --> 20:47.080
over 1/3 of his body

20:47.121 --> 20:48.372
and a concussion.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.499
Wow, who else is there?

20:48.414 --> 20:50.499
What other family?

20:50.541 --> 20:51.667
Colin and Finn were here,

20:50.541 --> 20:51.667
for a while

20:51.709 --> 20:53.044
but none of his family's here.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.587
How'd you get

20:53.086 --> 20:54.587
all that information?

20:54.628 --> 20:55.755
I thought they only

20:54.628 --> 20:55.755
allow family members to..

20:55.796 --> 20:57.506
- Paris.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.506
- God love her.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.466
I'm sorry I didn't call you

20:57.548 --> 20:59.466
sooner. I got your messages.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.801
I've just been so overwhelmed.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.386
'I'm just glad

21:00.843 --> 21:02.386
to hear from you.'

21:02.428 --> 21:04.764
Is there anything I can do,

21:02.428 --> 21:04.764
anything you need?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.974
It's been a while since

21:04.805 --> 21:06.974
I've sent out a care package.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.851
You could be up

21:07.016 --> 21:08.851
to your eyeballs in Mad Libs

21:08.893 --> 21:10.603
Silly String,

21:08.893 --> 21:10.603
malted milk balls.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.979
No, I'm good.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.397
Colin and Finn

21:12.021 --> 21:13.397
went back to New Haven

21:13.439 --> 21:15.399
to get some stuff for me and..

21:15.441 --> 21:17.443
...I think, I'm just gonna

21:15.441 --> 21:17.443
hang out here for a while.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.986
Logan is awake

21:17.484 --> 21:18.986
if you want to see him.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.279
Oh, mom, Logan's awake.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.948
Okay, call me if there's

21:20.320 --> 21:21.948
anything you need?

21:21.989 --> 21:23.365
- 'Thanks, bye.'

21:21.989 --> 21:23.365
- Bye.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.830
Hey.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.916
- Hey.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.916
- You're awake.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.002
Or hallucinating.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.002
Pretty good hallucination.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.172
- Oh, you're awake.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.172
- I must look like crap.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.423
Well, now I know

21:38.214 --> 21:39.423
why you never let me

21:39.465 --> 21:41.008
see you without makeup on.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.384
I guess maybe base-jumping

21:42.426 --> 21:43.594
with very little preparation

21:43.636 --> 21:45.054
wasn't the hottest idea.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.346
You're gonna be fine.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.765
You're gonna make

21:46.388 --> 21:47.765
a full recovery.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.225
Hey, Robocop made

21:47.807 --> 21:49.225
a full recovery

21:49.267 --> 21:50.559
look where that led him.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.352
This is the best

21:50.601 --> 21:52.352
hospital in the city

21:52.394 --> 21:54.272
and the best hospital

21:52.394 --> 21:54.272
in New York City

21:54.313 --> 21:56.149
is basically the best

21:54.313 --> 21:56.149
hospital in the country

21:56.190 --> 21:58.859
and that's basically

21:56.190 --> 21:58.859
the best hospital in the world

21:58.901 --> 22:01.612
so all in all, you're in

21:58.901 --> 22:01.612
the best place you could be

22:01.654 --> 22:02.738
all things considered.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.073
[groans]

22:04.115 --> 22:05.491
Hey, what do you

22:04.115 --> 22:05.491
think you're doing?

22:05.532 --> 22:06.533
Lay down.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.035
[sighs]

22:08.077 --> 22:10.037
I'm really

22:08.077 --> 22:10.037
sorry about this.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.330
- It's okay.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.330
- No.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.957
It's not okay.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.957
I was showing off.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.667
I knew it wasn't

22:12.999 --> 22:14.667
safe from that cliff.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.003
I was so drunk, I was lucky

22:14.708 --> 22:17.003
I pulled my chute at all.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.587
'You're going to be fine'

22:18.629 --> 22:20.673
and I will be here as

22:18.629 --> 22:20.673
long as you want me to be.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.092
I've already located the gift

22:20.714 --> 22:23.092
shop and the good cafeteria

22:23.134 --> 22:24.551
"good" being a relative term

22:24.593 --> 22:25.886
and the maternity ward

22:25.928 --> 22:27.471
in case I wanna play

22:25.928 --> 22:27.471
a little practical joke

22:27.513 --> 22:28.973
swap the newborns around.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.141
[chuckles]

22:30.183 --> 22:32.434
What about the paper, school?

22:32.476 --> 22:35.104
I have my laptop. I can

22:32.476 --> 22:35.104
stay on top of my schoolwork.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.772
And Bill can run

22:35.146 --> 22:36.772
the paper for a while.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.858
I don't want you to fall behind

22:36.814 --> 22:38.858
and miss too many classes.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.985
You've already got more than

22:38.899 --> 22:40.985
enough to do without having to--

22:41.027 --> 22:43.403
Shh, Logan, just relax.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.281
Get some rest.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.281
I'll be here.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.284
I'm glad.

22:50.828 --> 22:55.582
♪ La la la ♪

22:55.624 --> 22:58.919
♪ La la la ♪♪

22:58.961 --> 23:01.047
So, how we doing?

22:58.961 --> 23:01.047
We having fun?

23:01.088 --> 23:03.049
Uh..

23:03.090 --> 23:05.383
Marcia, you

23:03.090 --> 23:05.383
have to discard.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.802
I know, but you

23:05.425 --> 23:06.802
only need one card

23:06.844 --> 23:08.262
and I don't want

23:06.844 --> 23:08.262
to give it to you.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.847
What makes you think

23:08.304 --> 23:09.847
I only need one card?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.640
Oh, please, you pick

23:09.889 --> 23:11.640
up a card and discard

23:11.682 --> 23:13.433
like every half-second.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.433
It's so obvious.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.061
Well, it's my birthday.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.687
Why don't you just give me

23:15.102 --> 23:16.687
the stupid card I want?

23:16.729 --> 23:20.191
Hey, uh, uh, how do you

23:16.729 --> 23:20.191
think the temperature is?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.276
- It's fine, I guess.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.276
- Are-are you cold?

23:22.318 --> 23:23.694
Maybe it's too cold in here.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.364
How many people are cold, huh?

23:26.404 --> 23:28.949
Anyone too warm?

23:28.991 --> 23:31.244
- Okay, well...good to know.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.244
- Uh.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.370
- Luke?

23:31.285 --> 23:32.370
- Yeah.

23:32.410 --> 23:33.829
Can I go to

23:32.410 --> 23:33.829
the bathroom?

23:33.871 --> 23:35.373
Of course.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.457
You don't have to ask permission

23:35.413 --> 23:37.457
to go to the bathroom.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.502
But it's in the restricted area.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.502
I could lose a finger.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.297
Ah, well, th-the bathroom is

23:40.544 --> 23:43.297
not part of the restricted area.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.631
I-I didn't mean

23:43.339 --> 23:44.631
to include that.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.967
Does anyone else have

23:44.673 --> 23:46.967
to go to the bathroom?

23:47.009 --> 23:51.597
Oh! Well, alright.

23:47.009 --> 23:51.597
Well, let's line up, okay?

23:51.638 --> 23:53.182
You can use the bathroom

23:51.638 --> 23:53.182
one at a time.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.433
- Laura, you first.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.433
- Thank you.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.396
Uh, I'll be right out.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.647
I just have to check

23:58.436 --> 24:00.647
on something in the back.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.817
[phone ringing]

24:03.859 --> 24:05.403
Mmm.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.570
Dragonfly Inn.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.530
- It's a disaster.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.530
- 'What?'

24:08.572 --> 24:10.241
The party, it's

24:08.572 --> 24:10.241
a total disaster.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.159
- A disaster? Why?

24:10.283 --> 24:12.159
- Nothing's happening.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.827
It's like a funeral

24:12.201 --> 24:13.827
hall in there.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.122
I didn't know 13-year-old

24:13.869 --> 24:16.122
girls could be so unhappy.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.831
(Lorelai on phone)

24:16.163 --> 24:17.831
'Where are you?

24:16.163 --> 24:17.831
I don't hear anything.'

24:17.873 --> 24:20.126
I'm in the storage room.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.126
I come in here and hide a lot.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.752
And leaving them unsupervised?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.921
Well, there's a peephole

24:21.794 --> 24:23.921
here I can see out of.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.881
You're peeping at the girls

24:23.963 --> 24:25.881
from the storage room?

24:25.923 --> 24:29.009
I do not have time

24:25.923 --> 24:29.009
for any weird jokes.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.010
Okay, what are they doing?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.555
Well, April was playing cards.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.682
Some of the others were

24:33.597 --> 24:35.682
reading and playing video games.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.310
(Luke on phone)

24:35.724 --> 24:37.310
'But at the moment,

24:35.724 --> 24:37.310
they're all just'

24:37.351 --> 24:39.270
'standing in line waiting

24:37.351 --> 24:39.270
to go to the bathroom.'

24:39.312 --> 24:40.813
You didn't plan any activities?

24:40.854 --> 24:41.981
It's a birthday party.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.399
I thought that was the activity.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.442
Oh, Luke.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.612
Hey, is it normal for kids to

24:46.319 --> 24:48.612
fall asleep at a birthday party?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.281
- Luke, are you listening?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.281
- 'Yes.'

24:50.323 --> 24:52.532
- Go and get your clock radio.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.532
- Why?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.076
So we can watch

24:52.574 --> 24:54.076
the minutes of the world's

24:54.118 --> 24:56.329
worst birthday party

24:54.118 --> 24:56.329
tick off one by one?

24:56.370 --> 24:58.289
No, go get it,

24:56.370 --> 24:58.289
bring it downstairs

24:58.331 --> 24:59.832
and put on some music KC101.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.499
- I'll be right over.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.499
- You're coming here?

25:01.541 --> 25:03.836
Just stall for time, I have

25:01.541 --> 25:03.836
some things to finish up

25:03.877 --> 25:05.503
and then I'll come over,

25:03.877 --> 25:05.503
if it's, okay?

25:05.545 --> 25:07.965
- What?

25:05.545 --> 25:07.965
- Is it okay that I come over?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.758
Yes, Lorelai, come! Hurry!

25:09.800 --> 25:11.302
- Okay, I'll hurry.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.302
- Hurry faster.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.719
They might start

25:11.344 --> 25:12.719
leaving or something.

25:12.761 --> 25:13.929
Okay, bye.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.017
[door opens]

25:18.642 --> 25:19.768
Hey.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.061
So, it got worse

25:19.810 --> 25:21.061
after we hung up.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.188
- Did you get the radio?

25:21.103 --> 25:22.188
- No.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.605
I forgot the radio

25:22.229 --> 25:23.605
part was broken

25:23.647 --> 25:25.358
and the buzzer alarm

25:23.647 --> 25:25.358
went off at one point.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.151
There was slight uptick in the

25:25.399 --> 25:27.151
mood, but that didn't last long.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.735
- I think it's too late.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.735
- It's not too late.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.113
I swear I heard the word

25:28.777 --> 25:31.113
mutiny bandied around in there.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.198
It's not too late.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.198
Let's get in there.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.450
But...where's the stuff?

25:34.492 --> 25:36.035
- What stuff?

25:34.492 --> 25:36.035
- The party stuff.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.953
Oh, my God, I left

25:36.076 --> 25:37.953
the circus elephants in my car

25:37.995 --> 25:39.372
and I didn't

25:37.995 --> 25:39.372
crack a window.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.081
But seriously,

25:39.413 --> 25:41.081
where's the party stuff?

25:41.123 --> 25:42.749
Come on.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.749
Follow my lead.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.128
Hey, everybody.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.128
I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.754
Thank you so much

25:46.170 --> 25:47.754
for your patience.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.756
I'm really glad you guys

25:47.796 --> 25:49.756
waited to start the party

25:49.798 --> 25:51.675
until I got here, huh.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.886
Oh, um, that's

25:51.717 --> 25:53.886
okay, Lorelai.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.888
We didn't mind,

25:53.927 --> 25:55.888
right, girls?

25:55.929 --> 25:57.931
(Lorelai)

25:55.929 --> 25:57.931
'Great. Okay, let's

25:55.929 --> 25:57.931
get this party started.'

25:57.973 --> 25:59.683
- Where's the birthday girl?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.683
- Here.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.520
April Nardini, front and center.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.562
You know, I, uh,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.562
met you briefly.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.232
You were filling salt

26:04.604 --> 26:06.232
and pepper shakers.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.525
I remember, you were

26:06.273 --> 26:07.525
dressed in all black

26:07.565 --> 26:08.566
and you had really blue eyes.

26:08.608 --> 26:09.776
They aren't quite as blue today.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.070
But I think that's

26:09.818 --> 26:11.070
just a light thing.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.821
These irises are

26:11.111 --> 26:12.821
all natural, baby.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.199
Alright, everybody, line

26:12.863 --> 26:15.199
up single file behind us.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.783
Oh, we already

26:15.241 --> 26:16.783
went to the bathroom.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.452
Oh, I know, this is gonna

26:16.825 --> 26:18.452
be so-o-o much better.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.371
Now, take the hand of

26:18.494 --> 26:20.371
the person in front of you

26:20.413 --> 26:21.955
and the person

26:20.413 --> 26:21.955
in the back of you.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.623
Luke, you pull up the rear.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.623
I'll take the lead.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.875
Sure. What is this?

26:24.917 --> 26:26.584
Just follow me, everybody.

26:26.626 --> 26:29.505
No matter what, do not

26:26.626 --> 26:29.505
let go of either hand.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.131
We're not allowed

26:29.547 --> 26:31.131
to go outside.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.299
Or in the kitchen.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.260
- Or anywhere else.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.260
- What?

26:34.301 --> 26:37.012
Y-you are now, girls.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.012
We got new rules.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.266
- Should we bring our stuff?

26:37.054 --> 26:40.266
- No, leave it. We'll be back.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.684
(Luke)

26:40.307 --> 26:42.684
Alright, everybody try

26:40.307 --> 26:42.684
to walk at the same pace.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.104
You step on somebody's heels,

26:42.726 --> 26:45.104
you could break an ankle.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.647
And watch out for the traffic,

26:45.145 --> 26:47.647
not just cars, but bikes.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.150
People in this town ride

26:47.689 --> 26:50.150
their bikes like maniacs.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.651
- 'Luke!'

26:50.192 --> 26:51.651
- Sorry.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.863
Oh, check for traffic.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.863
Always check. And go!

26:54.905 --> 26:57.283
- Where are we going?

26:54.905 --> 26:57.283
- No idea!

26:57.324 --> 26:58.909
Serpentine,

26:57.324 --> 26:58.909
girls, serpentine.

26:58.951 --> 26:59.993
[girls giggling]

27:00.035 --> 27:01.703
Is this wise to serpentine?

27:02.829 --> 27:04.206
No!

27:04.248 --> 27:06.500
[girls laughing]

27:09.753 --> 27:11.380
- Hi, Lorelai.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.380
- Hi.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.924
- Hi.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.924
- Hey, girls.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.634
Uh, alright, I'd like you

27:13.966 --> 27:16.634
to meet the birthday girl.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.636
(both)

27:16.676 --> 27:18.636
Hi, April.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.389
- Happy birthday.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.389
- Hello.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.182
Oh, you are adorable.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.560
Alright, girls, I want

27:22.224 --> 27:24.560
you each to take a basket

27:24.602 --> 27:26.103
and fill it up.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.813
Uh, I want you to

27:26.145 --> 27:27.813
pick anything you want

27:27.854 --> 27:29.356
'because today we're

27:27.854 --> 27:29.356
getting makeovers.'

27:29.398 --> 27:31.358
[screaming]

27:31.400 --> 27:33.569
These two ladies are here

27:31.400 --> 27:33.569
to help you in any way you need.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.362
That's Alison and Leslie.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.614
(all)

27:35.404 --> 27:36.614
Hi.

27:36.654 --> 27:40.033
On your mark, get set, and shop!

27:40.075 --> 27:41.243
[screaming]

27:42.328 --> 27:43.412
You're a genius.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.871
Well, 13-year-old

27:43.454 --> 27:44.871
girls and makeup

27:44.913 --> 27:46.123
'it's like betting

27:44.913 --> 27:46.123
on secretariat.'

27:46.165 --> 27:47.625
(Luke)

27:46.165 --> 27:47.625
'Never in a million years'

27:47.665 --> 27:48.917
would I have thought

27:47.665 --> 27:48.917
of something like this.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.419
That's why I'm

27:48.959 --> 27:50.419
the yin to your yang

27:50.461 --> 27:52.630
the Emack to your Bolio.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.089
Hey, who wants

27:52.670 --> 27:54.089
hot pink highlights?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.175
Ooh, me! Oh, my God.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.093
I hate that you're cutting

27:56.216 --> 27:58.093
your honeymoon short.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.721
It's okay. With mom flaking out,

27:58.135 --> 28:01.721
I don't want to be here anymore.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.432
We've got seats on

28:01.763 --> 28:03.432
a flight going out tonight

28:03.474 --> 28:05.392
but it's got a 5-hour

28:03.474 --> 28:05.392
layover in Ankara.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.394
So we're still trying to

28:05.434 --> 28:07.394
find something more direct.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.229
Either way we should be

28:07.436 --> 28:09.229
there sometime tomorrow night.

28:09.271 --> 28:12.358
Okay. So, have you heard

28:09.271 --> 28:12.358
anything more from your dad?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.942
Yeah, I just talked to him.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.986
- 'So, is he coming down here?'

28:13.984 --> 28:15.986
- Nope.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.113
- 'He's out of town too?'

28:16.028 --> 28:18.113
- No, he's home.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.157
- He's just not coming.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.157
- What?

28:20.199 --> 28:21.575
(Honor on phone)

28:20.199 --> 28:21.575
'It's the whole Life

28:20.199 --> 28:21.575
and Death Brigade thing.'

28:21.617 --> 28:23.035
'He's very against it.'

28:23.076 --> 28:24.702
But he was in

28:23.076 --> 28:24.702
the Life and Death Brigade.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.704
Yes, but he feels that

28:24.744 --> 28:26.704
<i>he</i> knew when to grow up

28:26.746 --> 28:29.291
and accept responsibility

28:26.746 --> 28:29.291
and that Logan doesn't.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.627
He wanted his precious boy

28:29.333 --> 28:31.627
done with that by now

28:31.669 --> 28:32.961
so he's boycotting.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.047
He's boycotting his injured son?

28:35.088 --> 28:36.714
Logan had emergency surgery.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.052
Hypocrisy runs very deep

28:36.756 --> 28:40.052
in the Huntzberger family.

28:40.093 --> 28:43.556
Anyhow, forget it. I'm sure

28:40.093 --> 28:43.556
Logan isn't expecting him.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.724
Okay, so I'll call later when

28:43.597 --> 28:45.724
I have more flight information.

28:45.765 --> 28:46.933
Okay, bye.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.575
Mitchum Huntzberger?

29:02.616 --> 29:04.451
Yes, it's Rory Gilmore.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.119
I just thought I'd

29:04.493 --> 29:06.119
call and remind you

29:06.161 --> 29:07.996
that Logan is lying

29:06.161 --> 29:07.996
in a hospital bed

29:08.038 --> 29:10.165
with a partially collapsed

29:08.038 --> 29:10.165
lung and a whole host

29:10.207 --> 29:12.334
of other potentially

29:10.207 --> 29:12.334
life-threatening injuries

29:12.376 --> 29:13.919
and I'm figuring a guy like you

29:13.960 --> 29:15.421
surrounded by

29:13.960 --> 29:15.421
nothing but a bunch

29:15.462 --> 29:16.714
of terrified sycophants

29:16.755 --> 29:18.173
might not have

29:16.755 --> 29:18.173
someone in his life

29:18.215 --> 29:19.592
with the guts to tell him

29:19.633 --> 29:21.218
what an incredibly selfish

29:21.260 --> 29:22.802
narcissistic ass he's being

29:22.844 --> 29:24.304
so I thought I'd jump on in.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.181
Swallow your pride,

29:24.346 --> 29:26.181
get in your car

29:26.223 --> 29:29.017
and come down here

29:26.223 --> 29:29.017
and see your son! Now!

29:31.186 --> 29:32.563
That looks excellent.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.942
[gasps]

29:34.523 --> 29:36.942
Marcia, fabulous.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.193
You look like

29:36.983 --> 29:38.193
Sophia Loren.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.987
I was going for

29:38.235 --> 29:40.987
Vanessa Minnillo on MTV.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.532
- Ah, I love her music.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.532
- She's a VJ.

29:43.574 --> 29:44.908
No. Well, you

29:43.574 --> 29:44.908
didn't let me finish.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.327
I love her music video

29:44.950 --> 29:47.327
introductions, you know.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.996
She's so smooth and classy.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.996
Uh, Luke, more chips here.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.165
- 'Coming.'

29:50.038 --> 29:52.165
- Lorelai, check this out.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.669
Ooh, cool. Your eyes have eyes.

29:55.711 --> 29:56.878
- Freaky, right?

29:55.711 --> 29:56.878
- Yes.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.921
You could fall

29:56.920 --> 29:57.921
asleep in class

29:57.963 --> 29:59.590
and no one

29:57.963 --> 29:59.590
would know.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.007
(April)

29:59.632 --> 30:01.007
'Lorelai.'

30:01.049 --> 30:03.927
Oh, April, you look beautiful.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.429
Leslie says I have

30:03.969 --> 30:05.429
excellent bone structure.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.972
Yes. Well, I

30:05.471 --> 30:06.972
agree with her.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.224
So it's not weird when

30:07.013 --> 30:09.224
someone compliments your skull?

30:09.266 --> 30:11.560
No, a woman takes any

30:09.266 --> 30:11.560
compliment that comes her way.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.146
Got it. Hey, did you do that

30:11.602 --> 30:14.146
glitter heart on your cheek?

30:14.187 --> 30:16.523
Happens to be my handiwork.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.523
Yeah, you want one?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.525
- Yeah.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.525
- Alright, sit, sit.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.152
Uh, what color

30:18.567 --> 30:20.152
would you like?

30:20.193 --> 30:23.071
Pink, blue, purple,

30:20.193 --> 30:23.071
florescent green?

30:23.113 --> 30:24.698
Purple. I'm

30:23.113 --> 30:24.698
obsessed with purple.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.949
Probably because

30:24.740 --> 30:25.949
I'm obsessed with

30:25.991 --> 30:27.326
"Harold And

30:25.991 --> 30:27.326
The Purple Crayon."

30:27.367 --> 30:28.619
I know I'm too old

30:27.367 --> 30:28.619
but it's still like

30:28.661 --> 30:30.036
one of my all-time

30:28.661 --> 30:30.036
favorite books.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.455
That's okay.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.040
I'm too old for "Us Weekly."

30:31.497 --> 30:34.040
It never stopped me.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.501
So, you have

30:34.082 --> 30:35.501
a daughter, right?

30:35.542 --> 30:36.918
Yes. Rory.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.878
That's good.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.878
You'd be wasted on a son.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.422
I'm gonna take that

30:38.920 --> 30:40.422
as a compliment.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.424
It is. You know, you

30:40.464 --> 30:42.424
remind me of my mom.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.551
Oh. Is she handy

30:42.466 --> 30:44.551
with the glitter?

30:44.593 --> 30:47.179
She painted a mural on my wall

30:44.593 --> 30:47.179
in nail polish one night.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.598
[laughing]

30:47.220 --> 30:49.598
That's cool.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.933
I think you'd like her.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.977
- Alright, you're all done.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.977
- Thanks.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.981
Oh, my god. That is

30:55.646 --> 30:57.981
so cool. I love it.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.358
- Thanks, Marcia.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.358
- You're welcome.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.067
- She's loving her presents.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.067
- I know.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.570
- Okay, how about this one?

31:01.109 --> 31:03.570
- It's from your dad.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.738
Yeah, open it.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.532
Y-you know..

31:06.573 --> 31:08.950
...you don't have to open up

31:06.573 --> 31:08.950
all your presents right away.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.370
You could maybe save a few

31:08.992 --> 31:11.370
and open them tomorrow

31:11.411 --> 31:13.121
sort of extend the experience.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.456
Bad idea, Hagrid.

31:14.498 --> 31:17.917
I don't wanna

31:14.498 --> 31:17.917
extend the experience.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.420
- Wait, is that my gift?

31:17.959 --> 31:20.420
- It says it's from Luke.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.006
The new "Way Things Work."

31:20.462 --> 31:23.006
I was gonna get this.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.842
And a gift certificate

31:23.048 --> 31:24.842
to the Discovery store.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.677
Thanks, Luke!

31:26.719 --> 31:28.887
I love it! Thank you so much!

31:28.928 --> 31:30.263
You're welcome.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.351
- Thank you.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.351
- My pleasure.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.186
You know what would really

31:34.393 --> 31:36.186
push this party over the top?

31:36.228 --> 31:37.771
- What?

31:36.228 --> 31:37.771
- If we made it a sleepover.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.147
- Yeah?

31:37.813 --> 31:39.147
- Yeah.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.566
You've got sleeping

31:39.189 --> 31:40.566
bags and blankets.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.775
Plus, I still

31:40.607 --> 31:41.775
got Jess' bed.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.109
We could stick

31:41.817 --> 31:43.109
a couple of 'em on that.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.152
Why don't you ask

31:43.151 --> 31:44.152
the birthday girl

31:44.194 --> 31:45.529
if she wants to do that?

31:45.571 --> 31:48.156
- April, come here a sec.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.156
- What's up?

31:48.198 --> 31:50.409
How would you feel about

31:48.198 --> 31:50.409
making this a slumber party?

31:50.450 --> 31:51.744
- Really?

31:50.450 --> 31:51.744
- Really.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.328
- Do you guys wanna sleep over?

31:51.785 --> 31:53.328
- Ooh!

31:53.370 --> 31:54.996
- Yeah!

31:53.370 --> 31:54.996
- That would be really cool.

31:55.038 --> 31:58.083
Great, uh, first off, we

31:55.038 --> 31:58.083
got to call all your parents

31:58.124 --> 31:59.835
to see if it's

31:58.124 --> 31:59.835
okay with them. Okay?

31:59.877 --> 32:02.254
So, with that in

31:59.877 --> 32:02.254
mind...why don't we

32:02.295 --> 32:05.006
form a single-file line

32:02.295 --> 32:05.006
behind here to the phone?

32:05.048 --> 32:07.259
[cell phones beeping]

32:07.300 --> 32:11.179

32:07.300 --> 32:11.179
your own, I guess.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.556
[sighs]

32:12.598 --> 32:14.641
Hey, so, um, I think

32:12.598 --> 32:14.641
I'm gonna take off.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.643
What? No, stay.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.643
You gotta stay.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.311
- Are you sure?

32:16.685 --> 32:18.311
- It's a slumber party.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.646
You're the slumber

32:18.353 --> 32:19.646
party expert.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.607
What does Hagrid know

32:19.688 --> 32:21.607
about slumber parties?

32:21.648 --> 32:23.275
Would it be weird, the two

32:21.648 --> 32:23.275
of us sleeping together?

32:23.316 --> 32:24.777
You and the girls

32:23.316 --> 32:24.777
can sleep upstairs.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.528
- I'll figure somethin' out.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.528
- Are you sure?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.697
Yeah, absolutely.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.697
You have to stay.

32:28.739 --> 32:31.074
- April would want that.

32:28.739 --> 32:31.074
- Okay, I'll stay.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.326
- The movie's all ready to go.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.326
- Okay. Thanks, Kirk.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.455
I just need it back for

32:33.368 --> 32:36.455
the Weinstein retirement party.

32:36.496 --> 32:40.459
Mel Weinstein's a nut

32:36.496 --> 32:40.459
for John Hughes movies.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.669
Alright, girls, um..

32:42.711 --> 32:45.798
...you're about to meet

32:42.711 --> 32:45.798
someone very special to me.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.299
Her name is Molly Ringwald.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.342
Now, I know you

32:47.340 --> 32:49.342
don't know who that is

32:49.384 --> 32:52.638
'but suffice it to say, she is

32:49.384 --> 32:52.638
my generation's Audrey Hepburn.'

32:52.679 --> 32:54.264
And I know you don't

32:52.679 --> 32:54.264
know who that is, either

32:54.306 --> 32:56.975
but trust me,

32:54.306 --> 32:56.975
you're gonna love her.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.811
And, yes, that is the guy

32:57.016 --> 32:58.811
from "Two And A Half Men."

32:58.852 --> 33:00.186
Alright, enjoy.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.752

33:23.794 --> 33:25.963

33:26.004 --> 33:29.716
I-I-I forgot how much fun it

33:26.004 --> 33:29.716
could be just to put makeup on.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.427
You know, it's become so

33:29.758 --> 33:32.427
pragmatic, such drudgery.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.847
It's like all we use it

33:32.469 --> 33:34.847
for now is to look better.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.974
And why would the two of us

33:34.888 --> 33:36.974
ever need to look better?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.183
Exactly.

and Bonne Bell Lip Smackers?

Uh! I used to love

33:47.442 --> 33:49.444
Bonne Bell Lip Smackers.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.112
Well, who doesn't

33:49.486 --> 33:51.112
love a lip gloss

33:51.154 --> 33:52.823
that doubles

33:51.154 --> 33:52.823
as a necklace?

33:52.865 --> 33:54.199
And they smelled so great.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.450
Ooh, except once, I had

33:55.492 --> 33:56.827
the chocolate fudge

33:55.492 --> 33:56.827
flavored one

33:56.869 --> 33:57.911
and in study hall

33:57.953 --> 34:00.038
Trevor Fink ate

33:57.953 --> 34:00.038
the whole thing

34:00.079 --> 34:02.040
and then he threw

34:00.079 --> 34:02.040
it up all over

34:02.081 --> 34:03.876
my copy of

34:02.081 --> 34:03.876
"The Red Badge Of Courage."

34:03.917 --> 34:06.586
Well, we all had

34:03.917 --> 34:06.586
a Trevor Fink in our lives.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.463
So, it sounds like

34:06.628 --> 34:08.463
the party was great.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.132
It was a great party

34:08.505 --> 34:11.132
and a major breakthrough.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.718
April's awesome.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.718
I think she liked me.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.469
- I bet she loved you.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.469
- We bonded.

34:14.511 --> 34:15.929
And hopefully this

34:14.511 --> 34:15.929
means that things

34:15.971 --> 34:18.056
will change and I

34:15.971 --> 34:18.056
won't have to hide.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.182
- Good.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.182
- Yeah.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.266
Luke just needed that

34:20.308 --> 34:21.935
time and space, you know?

34:21.977 --> 34:24.646
And in hindsight,

34:21.977 --> 34:24.646
I think it was good for him

34:24.688 --> 34:26.648
and I'm really glad

34:24.688 --> 34:26.648
I let him have it.

34:26.690 --> 34:27.983
You were

34:26.690 --> 34:27.983
incredibly patient.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.360
I was...incredibly patient

34:30.402 --> 34:32.654
while at the same time

34:30.402 --> 34:32.654
incredibly impatient.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.281
- You're a complicated woman.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.281
- I am, yes.

34:35.323 --> 34:37.534
I try to deny it,

34:35.323 --> 34:37.534
but there it is.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.327
I'm kind of sad

34:37.576 --> 34:39.327
I wasn't at the party.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.038
I feel like I missed out.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.956
I thought you

34:41.079 --> 34:42.956
might feel that way

34:42.998 --> 34:44.041
so I brought you

34:42.998 --> 34:44.041
some leftovers.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.500

34:45.542 --> 34:47.085
- No!

34:45.542 --> 34:47.085
- Yes.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.212
I've got original,

34:47.126 --> 34:49.212

34:49.254 --> 34:51.256

34:49.254 --> 34:51.256
and Dr. Pepper.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.926
Mmm! I feel

34:51.297 --> 34:53.926
like I'm 15 again.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.053
Jackson's so getting

34:53.967 --> 34:56.053
under my bra tonight.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.220
Oh, my God!

34:57.262 --> 34:58.263
[both screaming]

34:58.304 --> 34:59.389
Luke, there's some glitter

34:59.431 --> 35:00.432
on my pancakes.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.474
Oh, sorry about that.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.227
Let me fix that up for you.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.312
Wasn't any glitter in the food

35:04.269 --> 35:06.312
when I was running the place.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.356

35:10.149 --> 35:11.484
Excuse me, is Luke around?

35:11.526 --> 35:13.236
Yeah, he's here.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.236
He's always here.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.321
Oh, hey, Anna,

35:13.278 --> 35:15.321
how are you?

35:15.363 --> 35:16.865
Can we talk in private?

35:16.907 --> 35:19.409
Uh, sure. This way.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.953
Caesar, I'm gonna take

35:19.451 --> 35:20.953
a couple of minutes.

35:20.994 --> 35:21.954
Whatever.

35:24.581 --> 35:25.874
So, what's up?

35:25.916 --> 35:27.459
- I can't believe you did this.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.459
- Did what?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.252
You said you wanted to

35:27.500 --> 35:29.252
throw her a party, Luke.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.796
- You.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.796
- I know. I did.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.464
No. You had your girlfriend

35:30.837 --> 35:32.464
throw her a party.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.882

35:32.505 --> 35:33.882
don't even know.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.508
never even met.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.886
- This is not our agreement.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.886
- Whoa. Wait a minute.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.013
I did throw the party.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.013
Lorelai was just helping out.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.473
- Helping out?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.473
- Yes.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.933
April said you spent

35:41.514 --> 35:42.933
the night downstairs.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.392
Yeah, well, I spent

35:42.975 --> 35:44.392
the night in the storage room.

35:44.434 --> 35:45.727
I thought it'd be

35:44.434 --> 35:45.727
a little weird if--

35:45.769 --> 35:47.479
So when you were

35:45.769 --> 35:47.479

Well, yeah.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.150
How am I supposed

35:50.649 --> 35:52.150
to explain that

35:52.191 --> 35:53.860
to the other

35:52.191 --> 35:53.860

35:53.902 --> 35:55.236
How am I supposed

35:53.902 --> 35:55.236

35:55.278 --> 35:56.863

35:56.905 --> 35:59.491
even met? Who does that?

35:59.532 --> 36:01.701
I'm sorry. I didn't think

35:59.532 --> 36:01.701
that it was gonna cause--

36:08.083 --> 36:11.044

36:11.086 --> 36:13.296
I know. I'm sorry.

You can trust me, I swear.

You know what?

I am too mad.

some sort of<i> origami</i> thing

But you were there

37:31.166 --> 37:32.458
the whole time.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.252
- We both threw the party.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.252
- I know.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.462
I told her that, but I left

37:34.293 --> 37:36.462
you alone with them all night

37:36.504 --> 37:37.839
'and didn't clear it

37:36.504 --> 37:37.839
with her first.'

37:37.881 --> 37:39.799
She's really mad about that.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.220
It's not your fault.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.220
I should have seen this coming.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.138
I was stupid.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.138
I didn't think it through.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.474
- I'm sorry.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.474
- Yeah, me too.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.395
I brought some beer,

37:50.435 --> 37:52.395
but I left it in the truck.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.022
- Be right back.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.022
- Okay.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.364
Hey.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.243
- So, my dad just left.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.243
- I saw.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.869
I still can't believe it.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.869
He actually visited.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.163
He was only moderately hostile,

38:07.911 --> 38:10.163
slightly condescending

38:10.205 --> 38:11.831
and no more

38:10.205 --> 38:11.831
self-centered than usual.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.459
Well, it's good that

38:11.873 --> 38:14.459
he came. Good for him.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.878
- Are you feeling any better?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.878
- I am.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.671
Of course, that could have

38:16.920 --> 38:18.671
something to do with the 27

38:18.713 --> 38:20.506
different medications

38:18.713 --> 38:20.506
they have me jacked up on.

38:20.548 --> 38:21.800
I checked with the doctor.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.802
It's mostly cough

38:21.841 --> 38:23.802
syrup and baby aspirin.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.888
What's wrong?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.888
I'm feeling better.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.059
What?

38:31.101 --> 38:32.936
- I'm sorry.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.936
- About what?

38:32.978 --> 38:35.396
About letting you go on this

38:32.978 --> 38:35.396
trip. I should've stopped you.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.732
I was just so busy

38:35.438 --> 38:37.732
being mad at you.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.609
I, I didn't think I

38:37.774 --> 38:39.609
was trying to punish you

38:39.651 --> 38:41.194
but I was trying to punish you.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.613
- No, Rory.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.613
- I should have stopped you.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.990
Hey, you couldn't

38:43.655 --> 38:44.990
have stopped me.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.866
A team of psychiatrists

38:45.031 --> 38:46.866
with tranquilizer guns

38:46.908 --> 38:48.367
couldn't have stopped me.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.367
I was going no matter what.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.787
It's my fault. Do not

38:48.409 --> 38:50.787
feel guilty about this.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.331
I just sent you out that door.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.331
I didn't even care.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.541
I was so cold. I just..

38:55.583 --> 38:57.836
- I could have lost you.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.836
- 'You didn't lose me.'

38:57.877 --> 38:59.004
But I could have, though.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.421
Look, I'm the one

39:00.463 --> 39:03.091
screwing things up

39:00.463 --> 39:03.091
with us here, not you.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.843
I'm sorry you're in

39:03.133 --> 39:04.843
the hospital right now.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.219
I'm sorry about all of this.

for the party.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.583
It was my fault.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.546

I just thought

40:30.595 --> 40:32.055
that we should meet

40:32.097 --> 40:33.306

40:32.097 --> 40:33.306
see you really

40:33.348 --> 40:34.849

40:52.617 --> 40:54.077
Okay. Then you get it.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.162
I mean, what if April

40:54.119 --> 40:56.162
decided she likes you?

40:56.204 --> 40:57.705
What if she becomes

40:56.204 --> 40:57.705
attached to you?

40:57.747 --> 40:59.332
What if you become

40:57.747 --> 40:59.332
her best friend

40:59.374 --> 41:01.418
in the entire world

40:59.374 --> 41:01.418
and then one day

41:01.459 --> 41:02.835
you just disappear?

41:02.877 --> 41:04.129
Well, that's

41:02.877 --> 41:04.129
not gonna happen.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.546
You don't know that.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.672
'You can't guarantee that'

41:08.133 --> 41:09.550
When it comes to my daughter

41:09.592 --> 41:11.761
I have to have rules.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.761
Hard and fast rules.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.596
And I would never

41:11.803 --> 41:13.596
dream of violating

41:13.638 --> 41:14.973
any of those rules, believe me.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.474
April never meets any man I date

41:16.515 --> 41:18.226
unless I've dated him for years.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.560
I totally get that.

41:19.602 --> 41:20.937
So, basically, until I'm

41:20.979 --> 41:22.772
ready to get married again

41:22.814 --> 41:24.441
she doesn't meet

41:22.814 --> 41:24.441
any of the men I date.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.901
- Right.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.901
- For all she knows, I'm a nun.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.362
Yeah. I went through a

41:26.943 --> 41:29.362
Sister Wendy phase myself once.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.697
- I want her to have stability.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.697
- 'Right.'

41:31.739 --> 41:34.784
But Luke and I, we are

41:31.739 --> 41:34.784
engaged. We are stable.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.662
Engaged isn't married.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.662
People get engaged all the time.

41:37.703 --> 41:40.081
Look, this is not something

41:37.703 --> 41:40.081
casual, Luke and me.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.959
This is not something we're

41:40.123 --> 41:42.959
rushing into, by any means.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.795
This has been a long

41:43.001 --> 41:45.795
time coming. A long time.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.922
This is real.

41:47.964 --> 41:49.715
That's wonderful.

41:47.964 --> 41:49.715
I'm really happy for you.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.509

41:59.351 --> 42:02.354
sticking around first.

42:02.395 --> 42:05.857
'And then, when you're married,

42:02.395 --> 42:05.857
we'll deal with that then.'

I'm not trying to be a hardass

42:05.898 --> 42:08.985
here. April's my world.

I don't know if my

42:09.027 --> 42:10.778
way is the right way.

I just have to go with my gut.
