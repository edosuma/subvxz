00:06.939 --> 00:08.360
- Hello?
- Lemon. Good morning.

00:08.370 --> 00:10.840
What... what is that sound?
Are you frying bacon?

00:10.870 --> 00:13.110
No,it's my new running shoes.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.820
Come on. Lemon,I'm going over the guest
list for my fiftieth birthday party.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.950
and you haven't gotten RSVPed.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.370
Oh,right. Sorry. My
mail's been piling up.

00:21.410 --> 00:24.070
And I keep forgetting
to buy toilet paper. So.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.180
What is that supposed to mean?

00:25.190 --> 00:26.310
Nothing,i'm coming.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.060
Good. And don't wear
that thing with a belt.

00:28.090 --> 00:30.800
What thing with a belt? Don't hang
up. I have a lot of belts that...

00:32.340 --> 00:34.670
Ugh,what is this idiot doing?

00:35.230 --> 00:40.220
I will be brief. I have decided to
fulfill my dream of going into space.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.950
If you have a spaceship and are
looking for a hillarious astronaut

00:43.960 --> 00:47.820
with an irregular heartbeat
and thirty million dollars.

00:47.850 --> 00:51.230
I'm prepared to leave
as soon as tomorrow.

00:51.980 --> 00:56.000
I wrote that yesterday. I
will not be taking questions.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.720
- Hello,dummy.
- No!

01:05.730 --> 01:07.970
Nope,not interested. Have a good life.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.280
It's important. It's about my mom.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.010
That was a lie.

01:18.020 --> 01:20.570
But listen,Elizabeth. I recently
discovered that I'm a sex addict.

01:20.610 --> 01:22.300
- No,you're not.
- Yeah,yeah.

01:22.310 --> 01:26.090
I'd be an even worse sex addict if I wasn't
so consumed by my latest business adventure.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.690
I don't wanna hear
about your job,Dennis.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.770
One word. Coffee. One
problem. What do you get it?

01:30.780 --> 01:33.110
Anywhere,you get it anywhere.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.940
Wrong. You get it at my
coffee vending machine.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.180
38 and 6th in the basement at K-mart.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.510
You just go downstairs.
You get the key from David.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.700
- And boom,you plug into a machine.
- You're done.

01:44.420 --> 01:47.190
But the point is I'm
Dennis. And I'm a sex addict.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.440
And one of my steps towards
recovery is atonement.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.420
Please,stop talking.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.200
Or my sex partner.

01:53.210 --> 01:56.750
I'm sorry that my disease has made
you my victim of my sexual chrisma.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.410
I'm sorry that I've
ruined you for other men.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.350
Apology accepted. Now
get out of my apartment.

02:01.380 --> 02:05.520
You know,my sponsor said you were gonna try
to pick a fight to lure me in and hit sex.

02:05.530 --> 02:10.660
It's not gonna work,Elizabeth. My
support group is lousy with infos.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.460
Have you seen this tracy thing?

02:33.660 --> 02:34.560
I am aware of it.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.660
I have a google news
alert for the phrase

02:36.760 --> 02:38.860
"tracy jordan ridiculous disaster."

02:38.960 --> 02:39.860
Have you spoken to him?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.260
We're on the phone with his assistant

02:41.260 --> 02:42.860
Setting up a time for us to talk.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.160
Well,when do you expect him?

02:44.460 --> 02:45.560
I think he has stuff all morning.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.660
You think or you know?

02:46.860 --> 02:48.460
Hang on. I'm going into a tunnel.

02:51.860 --> 02:52.560
What is this?

02:52.760 --> 02:55.760
My mother sent me a box
of old donaghy home movies.

02:55.860 --> 02:57.360
For your birthday? That's sweet.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.260
No,not really.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.460
This is the card that came with it.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.360
"jackie,here is some of your junk.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.460
"it was taking up the space

03:03.460 --> 03:05.760
"my new boyfriend
needed for his golf bags.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.960
His name is paul and he
doesn't want to meet you."

03:09.060 --> 03:10.060
- mm.
- at any rate,

03:10.160 --> 03:13.160
I had jonathan convert
the movies to dvd,

03:13.260 --> 03:15.460
Preserve these memories forever.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.960
Oh,my god.is that you?

03:21.260 --> 03:23.360
I like your little sweater vest.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.360
Oh! Hi-yo!

03:27.960 --> 03:29.960
- you threw up?
- what?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.760
As a kid you never got
so excited you vomited?

03:32.760 --> 03:33.960
No. No one does that.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.660
I mean,i've peed a little.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.560
Help me!

03:37.060 --> 03:38.960
His tie caught in the shredder!

03:39.060 --> 03:40.960
I'm lizzing! I'm lizzing!

03:43.060 --> 03:46.160
"lizzing" is a combination
of laughing and whizzing.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.860
Uh,well if you want
a good lizz,read this.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.110
- What is it?
- A list i made in the fifth grade...

03:52.120 --> 03:53.360
Of the things i wanted to have done

03:53.460 --> 03:54.460
By the time i turned 50.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.860
Oh,my god. This is adorable.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.760
"go to disneyland. Ride in an airplane.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.160
Kiss peggy fleming."

04:00.160 --> 04:03.060
Done,done,and oh,boy. Done.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.360
"live in a house with stairs.

04:05.660 --> 04:06.460
"beat up a russian.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.060
Hit mom with a car."

04:08.760 --> 04:10.260
I wonder what that ten
year old would think

04:10.360 --> 04:11.660
If he could see himself now.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.160
"fly on a plane." i've
flown on air force one.

04:15.860 --> 04:16.660
"go to disneyland."

04:16.760 --> 04:19.959
Lemon,i've held walt disney's
frozen head in my hands.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.060
That's awesome.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.760
I've danced with queen noor.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.760
I've hunted the world's
most dangerous game.

04:25.260 --> 04:25.860
Man.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.360
Excuse me. Manatee.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.960
I once shot a manatee.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.660
Well,if that kid could
see himself today,

04:34.860 --> 04:36.260
He would throw up.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.360
Thank you,lemon.

04:37.460 --> 04:38.260
There's only one left.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.960
"be friends with batman."

04:40.060 --> 04:41.160
There's still a couple of hours.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.060
Jonathan.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.860
Could you get adam west's
agent on the phone please.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.960
Griswald talent management.
Representing excellence.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.060
It's funny.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.460
I actually played peter pan on broadway.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.360
Did you know there's a
broadway street in tampa?

04:56.760 --> 04:57.760
Now this is important.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.160
This needs to be threaded all the way up

04:59.260 --> 05:00.260
In order to lock.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.460
Otherwise you could fall.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.760
- in bed.
- pay attention.

05:03.860 --> 05:05.160
Also,you can't have
anything in your pockets.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.360
Oh,my phone.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.160
Will you hold that? Thanks.

05:08.260 --> 05:08.860
Ready.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.260
I'm flying!

05:12.260 --> 05:14.960
Oh,my god.why are there
so many dead doves up here?

05:17.060 --> 05:17.560
Jenna's phone.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.860
Hey,jenna. This is dennis duffy.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.460
Yes,hello,this is jenna.

05:23.660 --> 05:24.460
I bet you never thought

05:24.460 --> 05:25.860
You'd be hearing from me again now,huh?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.660
Yes,really.why so ever
would you be phoning me?

05:28.860 --> 05:30.060
With the help of webmd

05:30.060 --> 05:32.760
I was recently self-diagnosed
as a sex addict.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.260
So former sex partner,i'm
sorry that my disease

05:35.360 --> 05:37.260
Made you a victim of my sexual charisma.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.260
I'm sorry that i ruined
you for other men.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.960
Look,i would've come down
there and done this in person

05:42.060 --> 05:44.160
But it's complicated because
of the whole liz thing you know.

05:44.660 --> 05:46.760
Naturally.liz. Always.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.460
If she found out about
this she couldn't handle it.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.960
And it would ruin your friendship.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.760
You know,i was the love of liz's life.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.460
I'm not sure you were
but apology accepted.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.360
Oh,no. i totally was.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.360
Peace.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
Forget it,tracy.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.760
Tracy,listen. You cannot go into space.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.660
Your contract expressly
prohibits dangerous activities

06:13.960 --> 06:16.660
Like extreme sports or riding
the subway on st. Patrick's day.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.260
What is this? Horseville?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.560
'Cause i am surrounded by naysayers!

06:20.760 --> 06:22.760
- wordplay.
- that is solid.

06:23.060 --> 06:25.460
Look,when i was a kid
growing up in the projects,

06:25.560 --> 06:26.960
I would look up at the stars

06:27.060 --> 06:30.760
And dream of going into
space. Of escaping the slums.

06:30.860 --> 06:32.260
Of killing an ewok!

06:32.460 --> 06:34.060
Now the man that that kid has become

06:34.260 --> 06:36.160
Can make those dreams come true.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.860
Do you know what that's like?

06:38.060 --> 06:38.960
I do,tracy.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.060
Then you know why i have to do this.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.160
As robert browning once wrote,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.560
"oh,but a man's reach
should exceed his grasp.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.760
Or what is a heaven for?"

06:49.160 --> 06:51.560
I was prepared for the
possibility of this meeting.

06:51.860 --> 06:54.260
Tracy,i'll call up my friends at nasa

06:54.860 --> 06:56.260
And i'll set up a flight for you.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.060
Thank you,jackie d.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.560
Jack,what the hell?

07:00.060 --> 07:02.760
I'm not taking his childhood
dream away from him.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.060
Not on my birthday.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.860
So you're just gonna let him do this?

07:05.860 --> 07:06.360
Of course not.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.860
I don't have friends at nasa.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.360
Bunch of nerds.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.160
You're gonna have to use your tv magic

07:11.260 --> 07:12.860
And fake a space launch for tracy.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.460
Aw,i was gonna go for a run today!

07:15.860 --> 07:17.060
Oh.ha ha.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.060
You missed a call.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.860
Was it my doctor/trainer?

07:24.960 --> 07:27.560
No,it was dennis. Dennis duffy.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.360
Calling me? Why?

07:30.560 --> 07:32.860
Well jenna,dennis has been going around

07:32.860 --> 07:35.060
Calling all the women
he's ever had sex with.

07:36.060 --> 07:36.960
- did you speak to him?
- yes.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.160
- did you pretend to be me?
- i did.

07:38.160 --> 07:38.760
Did you do an impression of me?

07:38.760 --> 07:39.660
- of course.
- was it british?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.260
- it was.
- oh,my god,liz.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.860
First of all,the reason i
have some english inflection

07:44.960 --> 07:46.660
In my speech is because
i lost my virginity

07:46.660 --> 07:48.360
- to the my fair lady
soundtrack. - jenna--

07:48.460 --> 07:50.060
Second,you guys had broken up

07:50.160 --> 07:52.660
And dennis and i were
in a very emotional place

07:52.760 --> 07:54.760
- because of hurricane katrina.
- jenna,stop.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.060
Yes,what you did was disgusting.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.960
But how long have we known each other?

08:00.060 --> 08:01.360
15 years.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.060
We met at that car dealership
audition in chicago.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.860
You were trying to be an actress then,

08:05.960 --> 08:07.560
- despite your neck
- right. Yes.

08:07.660 --> 08:10.260
Well we have both seen
this happen too many times.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.560
A strong female friendship
torn apart by some guy.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.260
But that's not what's
gonna happen this time.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.960
Dennis duffy said he didn't want this

08:17.060 --> 08:18.560
To hurt our friendship.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.960
As if someone like him ever could.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.860
Oh,thank you,liz.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.260
I mean,the idea that
that guy is walking around

08:26.360 --> 08:28.860
Thinking he means anything
to me--to either of us--

08:28.960 --> 08:29.760
It's ridiculous.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.060
It's unacceptable.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.360
We shouldn't let him get away with it.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.159
Are you thinking what i'm thinking?

08:33.360 --> 08:35.659
- yeah,let's stab him.
- let's give him a piece of our mind.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.159
Yeah,your thing.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.460
More gifts,mr. Donaghy.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.760
Oh,you got a new tuxedo for your party.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.260
You know i wore nothing
but hand-me-downs

08:48.360 --> 08:49.560
Until i was 12 years old.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.160
But i thought you were the oldest,sir.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.060
Oldest boy.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.160
- now look at me.
- i already did.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.560
Wow. That's a lot of loot.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.960
My last birthday,i cleaned up.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.960
Look at this keychain i got.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.860
Every time you move
his head,his head moves!

09:05.960 --> 09:06.560
Look!

09:06.960 --> 09:08.560
Kenneth,i wonder what it's like

09:08.560 --> 09:10.760
Seeing the world through your eyes.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.160
I don't know,mr. Donaghy.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.960
I think i see the world
pretty much the same

09:14.060 --> 09:14.860
As everyone else.

09:15.460 --> 09:15.960
Really?

09:16.560 --> 09:18.760
* 'cause i think you're
very special,kenneth *

09:18.860 --> 09:19.460
Pardon me.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.960
* to be able to get so much joy *

09:21.960 --> 09:24.260
- * from simple things *
- * simple things *

09:24.260 --> 09:26.360
* simple * things.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
But most of us grow up

09:27.860 --> 09:29.860
And lose our sense of wonder.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.960
- oh,that's sad.
- not really. No.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.260
I've surpassed my wildest dreams.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.660
I'm--i'm happier
than i've ever been.

09:39.060 --> 09:40.360
Of course you are.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.460
You've got all these fancy presents

09:42.460 --> 09:43.760
From business associates

09:43.860 --> 09:46.460
And this big empty
house to store them in.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.960
Happy birthday,mr. Donaghy.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.560
Hello,dummy.

09:59.160 --> 09:59.760
Hey.

10:01.160 --> 10:01.760
What's up?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.660
I know about you and jenna,dennis.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.560
Oh.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.460
I--i get why
you're here.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
You want me to rank you.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.260
- apples and oranges,ladies.
- no. Stop. Shut up.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.060
I'm here because i want you to know

10:13.160 --> 10:15.460
That i am not mad at jenna about this.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.260
Well,you can't be mad at me either,liz.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.560
I mean,i went to your apartment
that night looking for you.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.660
To be with you.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.560
Wait a minute,hang on. My apartment?

10:22.660 --> 10:23.860
Okay,i can explain that.

10:24.260 --> 10:26.760
You had gone on that over 30
outward bound trip to arizona.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.860
And you had asked me to housesit.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.160
Well,dennis came over.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.260
And as i mentioned,

10:30.260 --> 10:32.860
We were both pretty torn
up about hurricane katrina.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.160
What those people were
doing to the superdome.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.560
Fine. All right.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.360
You know what,it happened.
What do you want from me?

10:39.460 --> 10:40.560
This is what i want from you.

10:40.760 --> 10:44.060
I want you to understand
exactly how unimportant you are.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.860
You are not the love of my life.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.960
You are not capable of hurting me.

10:48.060 --> 10:50.860
And you could never do anything
to damage this friendship.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.060
It was in your bed.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.460
Aw,guys,come on! i eat in there.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.260
No,i'm gonna take the high road.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.260
So good luck with your fake addiction

11:00.260 --> 11:02.260
And your inconveniently-located
vending machine.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.960
No,not okay,liz.

11:04.660 --> 11:05.460
Not okay.

11:06.060 --> 11:06.960
All right,fine. You know what?

11:07.760 --> 11:08.660
I'm ranking you now.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.260
Hey,blondie. You're number one.

11:11.660 --> 11:12.760
- thank you,dennis.
- i don't care.

11:14.170 --> 11:15.280
You got it.

11:19.860 --> 11:22.360
Ladies and gentlemen,i can't stay long.

11:22.460 --> 11:23.560
I'm on a case.

11:24.260 --> 11:25.860
The penguin's in town.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.460
But i would like to
introduce my good friend.

11:31.660 --> 11:33.060
The man of the hour.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.660
Jake delahey!

11:40.060 --> 11:40.660
Jake.

11:43.660 --> 11:44.260
This is wrong.

11:45.660 --> 11:46.260
It's all wrong.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.460
Everyone go home now.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.460
The party's over.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.960
I was told i'd get a meal.

11:55.060 --> 11:56.860
Fine. Why don't you just,uh...

12:08.160 --> 12:09.560
Jack,am i the first one here?

12:09.660 --> 12:11.960
Ugh! i waited. This always happens.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.260
Lemon,what's inside that box?

12:15.560 --> 12:16.660
I don't know. A toy?

12:16.860 --> 12:18.160
Tonight was supposed to be special.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.060
And all i could think
about was that kid.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.460
So happy,he threw up.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.860
The closest i came to vomiting tonight

12:23.960 --> 12:26.160
Was when i saw ann
coulter's shoulder blades.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.560
What happens to us?

12:28.660 --> 12:29.460
We grow up.

12:29.860 --> 12:30.660
I have a good life,

12:30.660 --> 12:32.160
But i'll never be that happy again.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.960
I want that back.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.860
Well,there's nothing
you can do about that.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.160
I disagree.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.760
I'm going to find out
what was inside that box.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.960
I'm going to buy it with money.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.360
And it's going to make me happy.

12:44.460 --> 12:45.360
If that doesn't work,

12:46.260 --> 12:47.960
I'm going to benjamin button myself.

12:48.660 --> 12:49.860
We're not meeting in the middle.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.560
Oh,hey.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.060
I just wanted to get you to approve

12:56.160 --> 12:57.760
The other astronauts we hired.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.160
Looks good. Where's tracy?

12:59.360 --> 13:00.160
In cape canaveral.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.660
By which i mean through that door.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.960
We told him he had to be
blindfolded before launch

13:04.060 --> 13:05.960
- to prevent space madness.
- sure.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.560
And then we put him on the channel four

13:07.560 --> 13:08.760
Traffic copter for a couple hours.

13:08.860 --> 13:10.860
And now he's landed
here in sunny florida.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.860
- well done,hornberger.
- yeah.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.660
As a child,i dreamed
of being a congressman

13:14.760 --> 13:15.560
Like my father.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.560
Now i do this.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.860
One dui in high school.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.360
At least it's dry heat here in florida.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.860
Good work astronaut jordan.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.360
Now do 20 space sit-ups.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.360
Computer,when do i get some tang?

13:35.060 --> 13:36.960
Also,i'm thirsty.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.160
Wordplay.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.460
Morning,jenna.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.660
Hey,you.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.860
God,telling dennis off
together was so empowering.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.560
I felt so jacked up on the way home

13:52.660 --> 13:53.960
That i threw a brick through the window

13:54.060 --> 13:55.260
Of a banana republic.

13:55.260 --> 13:56.860
Yeah,it was something.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.960
I can't believe dennis
tried to do that to us.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.960
But he got his,right? Sisterhood.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.260
Sure. Sisterhood!

14:10.360 --> 14:12.060
- oh.
- what?

14:14.160 --> 14:14.660
Nothing.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.760
Ah! Ah!

14:23.360 --> 14:25.760
Be careful,'cause that thing is open.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.860
I'll go get the
emergency floor marshall.

14:29.860 --> 14:30.960
Floor marshall!

14:31.660 --> 14:33.260
Hey,you called tech support?

14:33.360 --> 14:35.560
I need to see what's inside that box.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.460
If i learned anything from watching 24,

14:37.760 --> 14:39.660
You're gonna want to
zoom in and enhance.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.260
Why don't you ask jimmy what's in there?

14:42.360 --> 14:43.960
It says "from jimmy" on it.

14:45.460 --> 14:46.460
Jimmy flaherty.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.060
Jimmy,what did you get
me for my tenth birthday?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.560
Uh,i thought this was a job interview.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.860
I flew down from boston.

14:53.060 --> 14:53.760
I have to know,jimmy.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.960
I need to know what you
got me that made that happy.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.360
I don't remember,jack.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.960
Doesn't this thing have any sound on it?

15:01.060 --> 15:02.160
You're clearly saying something.

15:03.460 --> 15:05.560
Jonathan,get me a deaf person.

15:07.260 --> 15:09.560
I was told this was a job interview.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.660
Tell me,wendy. What am i saying?

15:12.560 --> 15:13.360
You're saying,

15:14.560 --> 15:17.860
"apollo,apollo,apollo--"

15:18.460 --> 15:19.960
Oh,my god! You puked!

15:20.460 --> 15:21.960
Why wouldn't you warn me?

15:22.060 --> 15:23.760
I'm staring at your mouth!

15:23.860 --> 15:24.560
Apollo.

15:25.260 --> 15:26.260
I know what it is!

15:30.660 --> 15:31.560
Liz lemon.

15:32.260 --> 15:35.360
Hey,sista! How's the leg?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.160
You are a piece of work.

15:37.460 --> 15:38.960
These crutches are real,everyone.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.460
- liz tried to kill me.
- what are you talking about?

15:41.560 --> 15:43.560
Oh,please,you saw the harness
and you didn't do anything.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.560
T-minus ten minutes.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.960
- be quiet. Tracy's coming.
- all systems are go for launch.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.160
Star wars.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.960
All that stuff about
our friendship was a lie.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.760
You would've let me die,liz!

16:09.960 --> 16:12.560
- over dennis duffy.
- so okay,i did a bad thing.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.460
But you slept with dennis.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.360
And now we're...even?

16:16.660 --> 16:18.460
Even? i can't even look at you.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.460
You know what?

16:19.660 --> 16:22.560
You're no long my plus one
to the canadian grammys.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.460
Two,one,zero.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.860
- lift off,we have a lift off.
- i'm scared

16:30.560 --> 16:32.260
But i'm also excited!

16:33.960 --> 16:36.360
Whoo!I'm lizzing!

16:36.460 --> 16:39.460
Ah ha ha ha! Lizzing!

16:39.660 --> 16:40.960
I'm lizzing!

16:41.060 --> 16:43.160
Yeah! Ha ha!

16:47.160 --> 16:48.860
Oh,what is that,sir?

16:48.960 --> 16:52.060
This is an apollo
command and lunar module

16:52.160 --> 16:55.060
That i just paid $7,000
for at a vintage toy store

16:55.360 --> 16:57.860
Where a morbidly obese
gentleman called me "pal."

16:58.360 --> 16:58.960
Whoa.

17:00.260 --> 17:02.060
Tracy to earth. Come in,earth!

17:03.360 --> 17:04.260
Mr. Jordan.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.859
How is space?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.560
Great wink,kenneth.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.960
Space is very cold but very beautiful.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.760
And sometimes it sounds like
jenna yelling in the distance.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.760
I think i--
oh,my god.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.260
Where did you get that rocket?

17:17.460 --> 17:19.260
Mr. Donaghy's letting me hold it.

17:19.460 --> 17:20.560
It's awesome.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.960
You know,i actually envy you two.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.560
Sometimes i wish i could see the world

17:24.660 --> 17:26.160
Through your eyes instead of mine.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.359
Hey,jackie d.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.760
If everyone could see the
world the way i see it,

17:30.360 --> 17:32.460
It would be a better place to live.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.160
I bet that's true,tracy.

17:37.060 --> 17:39.160
But that part of me is gone forever.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.960
I guess i just see the
world the way i see it.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.560
Is he letting me keep this?

17:51.760 --> 17:52.660
I think so.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.460
I wish i was there so
i could play with it.

17:56.960 --> 17:57.760
Hi,miss lemon.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.960
What do you want?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.160
I want to make it up to you,jenna.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.060
What can i do?

18:10.460 --> 18:12.360
How about on the next
show you could do that song

18:12.460 --> 18:14.160
That they wouldn't let you
sing at the inauguration?

18:14.360 --> 18:14.960
No.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.260
Chocolate rainbow is too good for tgs.

18:18.860 --> 18:19.660
You can tell them.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.460
You can tell the writers.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.460
Tell them what?

18:22.560 --> 18:23.560
About my commercial.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.560
The one i was in back in chicago. Ugh

18:30.660 --> 18:31.960
Everyone,listen to me.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.760
No,it's a real thing this time.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.560
When we were both living back in chicago

18:35.660 --> 18:37.060
And liz was still
trying to be an actress,

18:37.260 --> 18:38.760
The only job she ever booke

18:38.760 --> 18:41.160
- was for a local phone sex line.
- what?

18:41.260 --> 18:44.160
It was a chat line for urban singles.

18:44.260 --> 18:44.960
And they only hired her

18:44.960 --> 18:46.560
Because their first choice was deported.

18:46.660 --> 18:47.860
Okay,we're even.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.760
So you will
not find it--

18:49.960 --> 18:51.560
I found it. It's on youtube.

18:51.660 --> 18:52.660
What?
No--

18:52.760 --> 18:54.560
I have a cable to hook
the computer up to the tv.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.060
Then shut your wet
mouth and get that cable.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.360
- get it!
- come on,guys.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.760
Let's all be cool.
That's not gonna--

19:00.860 --> 19:01.760
Don't wait.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.460
How did you do that so fast?

19:06.460 --> 19:07.660
Hi,i'm bijou.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.960
- bijou!
- call me.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.460
Oh,my god!

19:13.360 --> 19:15.260
I have since had invisalign.
