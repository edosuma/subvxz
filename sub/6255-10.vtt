WEBVTT

00:01.666 --> 00:03.500
(indistinct conversations)

00:11.343 --> 00:14.111
Excuse me, may I ask
what the special is today?

00:14.145 --> 00:15.512
What does it look like?

00:15.547 --> 00:17.314
Honestly, I wouldn't know
where to start.

00:17.349 --> 00:20.017
It's beef stew, Einstein.
Maybe it will put some meat

00:20.051 --> 00:22.253
on those puny chicken
arms of yours. Next.

00:22.287 --> 00:23.420
Hey, dork.

00:23.455 --> 00:24.855
What'd you get me
for lunch today?

00:24.890 --> 00:26.323
Trevor, give me back my food.

00:26.358 --> 00:28.826
Or what? What,
are you gonna tell a teacher?

00:28.860 --> 00:30.694
Yes, the school has a
anti-bullying policy, Trevor.

00:30.729 --> 00:32.997
You're such an idiot, Heller.

00:33.031 --> 00:34.632
Actually, a more appropriate
invective would be "nerd".

00:34.666 --> 00:35.900
An idiot would be
better exemplified...

00:35.934 --> 00:37.434
You see this stew?

00:37.469 --> 00:39.370
My stew.
Yeah,

00:39.404 --> 00:41.939
well, I'm gonna eat it and there
is nothing you can do about it,

00:41.973 --> 00:43.407
idiot.

00:43.441 --> 00:46.744
Mmm, mmm.

00:46.778 --> 00:48.245
That is so good,

00:48.280 --> 00:50.247
and I still have my lunch money.

00:50.282 --> 00:52.283
Wow.

00:52.317 --> 00:54.118
Damn.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.054
<i>Quel dommage.</i>

00:57.088 --> 00:58.689
You broke a bicuspid.

00:58.723 --> 01:00.624
I didn't break anything.

01:00.659 --> 01:01.959
What the...

01:05.163 --> 01:07.031
The stew...

01:07.065 --> 01:08.699
Oh, it's people!

01:08.733 --> 01:10.301
The stew!

01:10.335 --> 01:12.670
It-It's people!

01:12.704 --> 01:14.305
(screaming)
It's people!

01:17.475 --> 01:19.877
(gasping, screaming continues)

01:23.281 --> 01:25.616
(retching)

01:25.650 --> 01:27.785
(indistinct shouting)

01:30.121 --> 01:31.755
BOOTH:
Mmm.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.124
Oh, that is by far, hands down,

01:34.159 --> 01:35.526
the best chili I've ever had.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.994
Really?

01:37.028 --> 01:39.196
The diner must have employed
a more accomplished chef

01:39.230 --> 01:40.531
while we were on our honeymoon.

01:40.565 --> 01:42.800
No, Bones, there's no new chef.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.134
It's the same chili as always.

01:44.169 --> 01:46.337
I don't understand.

01:46.371 --> 01:48.238
You said...
We're married, Bones.

01:48.273 --> 01:50.607
The sun is brighter,
the air is, it's crisper.

01:50.642 --> 01:52.443
(sniffing)
The food tastes better than ever.

01:52.477 --> 01:54.511
Air quality
and the sun's thermonuclear core

01:54.546 --> 01:55.980
have nothing to do with...
Love,

01:56.014 --> 01:58.248
Bones, love.
It changes everything.

01:58.283 --> 01:59.583
I mean, don't you
feel different

01:59.617 --> 02:01.118
now that you're married?

02:01.152 --> 02:02.920
My left hand does.

02:02.954 --> 02:04.888
I'm very aware of the ring,

02:04.923 --> 02:06.323
but I'll adapt.

02:06.358 --> 02:08.058
That's very big of you.

02:08.092 --> 02:09.258
Well, no, it's nothing, really,

02:09.294 --> 02:10.627
because I love you.

02:10.662 --> 02:12.529
(phone rings)
Right, good answer.

02:12.564 --> 02:14.798
Mmm.

02:14.833 --> 02:17.501
Booth.

02:17.535 --> 02:20.971
They found the body in what?

02:21.006 --> 02:22.773
Is everything all right, Booth?

02:22.807 --> 02:24.375
(groans)

02:24.409 --> 02:25.709
I lost my appetite.

02:25.744 --> 02:27.378
Why?
Hold that.

02:28.747 --> 02:32.316
CAROLINE:
My boss doesn't like this one.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.684
Federal programs paying

02:33.718 --> 02:35.419
for cannibalism
isn't sitting pretty

02:35.453 --> 02:36.720
on Capitol Hill.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.522
The gonion angle of the mandible

02:38.556 --> 02:39.990
indicates the victim was male.

02:40.025 --> 02:42.693
What kind sick mind serves
a person to kids?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.161
Maybe one of them wasn't ready
for a pop quiz.

02:44.195 --> 02:45.329
Are all the teachers
accounted for?

02:45.363 --> 02:47.498
Yeah.
My question is how did he

02:47.532 --> 02:48.932
get in the stew?
Well, wait a second,

02:48.967 --> 02:50.367
is that a student,
because, you know,

02:50.402 --> 02:51.568
if the school was serving kids,

02:51.603 --> 02:53.937
the press
is gonna eat us alive.

02:53.972 --> 02:55.372
Wear on the right central
incisor

02:55.407 --> 02:57.174
suggest age is mid-40s.

02:57.208 --> 02:58.809
That's something.
And the marbling

02:58.843 --> 03:02.179
on this piece is consistent
with human musculature.

03:02.213 --> 03:04.915
Ooh, tongue.

03:04.949 --> 03:06.984
Size and shape also human.

03:07.018 --> 03:09.153
The way the bones are cut
and crushed,

03:09.187 --> 03:10.921
the victim was processed.

03:10.955 --> 03:12.256
Processed?

03:12.290 --> 03:13.490
Oh, I agree, the tissue

03:13.525 --> 03:14.591
shows evidence
of being marinated.

03:14.626 --> 03:17.161
Are you saying he came in a can?

03:17.195 --> 03:18.829
Most definitely.

03:18.863 --> 03:20.864
This is why
I only buy free-range.

03:20.899 --> 03:21.932
Keep me informed, <i>cherie.</i>

03:21.966 --> 03:23.634
I have a... lunch.

03:23.668 --> 03:24.802
BOOTH: All right,
let's pack this up

03:24.836 --> 03:26.703
and whisk it back
to the Jeffersonian.

03:26.738 --> 03:28.105
Come on.

03:30.942 --> 03:33.877
This is all the stew
that's been processed recently.

03:33.912 --> 03:35.379
These cans are all

03:35.413 --> 03:37.581
from the same batch that
the school board purchased.

03:37.615 --> 03:39.516
None of the remains we found

03:39.551 --> 03:42.386
were larger
than six centimeters in length.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.254
(sighs) That sounds
like he must have gone

03:44.289 --> 03:45.722
through the meat processor.

03:45.757 --> 03:48.325
It cuts uniformly
with very little waste.

03:48.359 --> 03:49.793
What about the cameras
on the factory floor?

03:49.828 --> 03:51.361
None that I know of,

03:51.396 --> 03:53.897
but I'm in research
and development primarily.

03:53.932 --> 03:57.267
Our CEO, Sam Gifford,
can fill you in on security.

03:57.302 --> 03:59.303
He's flying in
from his place in Colorado.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.671
BRENNAN:
Chip fragment

04:00.705 --> 04:02.739
of a spinous process.
Whoa, wait a second,

04:02.774 --> 04:04.875
you're saying he's spread out
through all these cans?

04:04.909 --> 04:06.230
Seems that way.
I don't understand

04:06.244 --> 04:08.112
how this could've happened.

04:08.146 --> 04:09.146
We make a good product.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.415
We put in an abundance

04:11.449 --> 04:12.583
of nutrients, flavorings...

04:12.617 --> 04:13.784
And people.

04:13.818 --> 04:14.985
So are all these cans

04:15.019 --> 04:16.386
accounted for?
I had drivers

04:16.421 --> 04:19.055
picking up every can
from that batch.

04:19.089 --> 04:20.624
They're all here.
Seems that the school

04:20.658 --> 04:22.359
was the only place
that served it.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.495
How did this batch
even pass inspection?

04:24.529 --> 04:26.497
Human remains have
a different fat content.

04:26.531 --> 04:28.298
Not to mention...
It was inspected.

04:28.333 --> 04:29.833
All our product is,

04:29.868 --> 04:32.002
and this batch underperformed
the quality check,

04:32.036 --> 04:33.904
which is why it was diverted
to a second-tier market

04:33.938 --> 04:35.239
and not sold
to a grocery store.

04:35.273 --> 04:37.808
Public schools are
a second-tier market?

04:37.842 --> 04:39.576
(scoffs) Good luck spinning that
at the PTA.

04:39.611 --> 04:42.746
Clearly, this was just
a horrible accident.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.816
Someone must have fallen
into the machine.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.084
No, this was no accident, Booth.

04:47.118 --> 04:48.619
There were no clothes

04:48.653 --> 04:50.954
and the cooked tissue
shows no signs of bruising

04:50.989 --> 04:52.156
along the incision lines.

04:52.190 --> 04:53.857
Oh, my God.

04:53.892 --> 04:55.259
"Oh, my God," what?
The victim was killed

04:55.293 --> 04:57.027
prior to being fed
into the meat processor.

04:58.062 --> 04:59.997
Canned murder? Oh.

05:00.031 --> 05:01.532
That's a first.

Revolting.

All part of the job.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.818
It doesn't phase me
in the least.

05:42.852 --> 05:44.920
Have you had this one tested
for mental illness?

05:44.954 --> 05:46.588
DAISY: Yes.

05:46.623 --> 05:47.589
And I passed.

05:47.624 --> 05:49.491
I find that very
hard to believe.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.126
Okay, let me be more specific,
have you found

05:51.160 --> 05:52.361
more human body parts?

05:52.395 --> 05:53.762
I have.
There are fragments

05:53.796 --> 05:55.464
of human bone in every can,

05:55.498 --> 05:56.665
so it makes sense that

05:56.699 --> 05:58.967
the meat chunks are also human,

05:59.002 --> 06:00.235
but that's your area.

06:00.270 --> 06:01.837
Thank you for reminding me.

06:01.871 --> 06:03.839
Ooh, right zygomatic.

06:03.873 --> 06:05.207
Angela needs

06:05.241 --> 06:06.775
a complete skull
as soon as possible

06:06.809 --> 06:08.610
so she can start
the facial reconstruction.

06:08.645 --> 06:10.812
Remodeling along
the anterior aspect

06:10.847 --> 06:12.347
of the frontal skull bone.

06:12.382 --> 06:13.882
How are you gonna do
a full tox screen

06:13.916 --> 06:16.118
when all the human meat
has been heated up

06:16.152 --> 06:17.786
to the point of sterilization?

06:17.820 --> 06:19.588
Cross my fingers and hope
something survived the process.

06:19.622 --> 06:20.789
Not so sure

06:20.823 --> 06:22.124
that finger crossing

06:22.158 --> 06:23.458
is the best method,

06:23.493 --> 06:24.593
scientifically.

06:24.627 --> 06:26.595
Infuriating, right?

06:26.629 --> 06:28.363
This remodeling is dated.

06:28.398 --> 06:29.398
This incision is consistent

06:29.432 --> 06:31.700
with a frontal craniotomy scar.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.302
SAROYAN:
The victim underwent

06:33.336 --> 06:34.803
brain surgery.

06:34.837 --> 06:37.039
We can cross-reference
the surgical technique.

06:37.073 --> 06:38.373
The precision is exquisite.

06:38.408 --> 06:40.309
No jagged lines,
diamond excise shape.

06:40.343 --> 06:42.010
There couldn't be more

06:42.045 --> 06:44.246
than two or three neurosurgeons
that could've done this.

06:49.485 --> 06:51.153
The squints haven't found
any clothing.

06:51.187 --> 06:52.688
So he was killed, stripped

06:52.722 --> 06:54.856
and tossed into
the meat mulcher.

06:54.891 --> 06:56.291
Oh, for God's sake,
I wish I'd gone

06:56.326 --> 06:57.626
into modern dance
like my mother wanted.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.927
All right, look, I
think we can assume

06:58.961 --> 07:00.762
that the murder and the mulching

07:00.797 --> 07:02.230
both happened at the same place.

07:02.265 --> 07:04.166
(computer beeping)

07:04.200 --> 07:06.034
(chimes)
Got a hit here.

07:06.069 --> 07:09.438
Squints I.D.'d the victim.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.106
Howard Compton, 41.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.975
SWEETS: He had an
operation for anosmia.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.845
He was bald?
He couldn't smell.

07:16.879 --> 07:20.482
Chemist, biologist,
psychophysicist.

07:20.516 --> 07:21.917
He was a food scientist.
Says here

07:21.951 --> 07:23.018
he invented Lava Chips.

07:23.052 --> 07:24.419
Lava Chips?
I mean, come on.

07:24.454 --> 07:25.654
That's, like,
the best snack ever.

07:25.688 --> 07:26.755
I love them.
Right?

07:26.789 --> 07:28.857
I find them a bit spicy.

07:28.891 --> 07:30.525
That's 'cause they're made from lava.
Well, not literally.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.094
Yeah, they are, actually.
Reported missing

07:32.128 --> 07:35.397
by his business partner,
Agatha Blume, five days ago.

07:35.431 --> 07:36.598
You talk to her.

07:36.632 --> 07:38.166
What are you gonna do?

07:38.201 --> 07:40.235
Inform the press
that you're making great headway

07:40.269 --> 07:41.737
in catching the murderer

07:41.771 --> 07:44.005
who turned a school full
of children into cannibals.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.407
Well, yeah,
that's important, too.

07:45.441 --> 07:48.243
Yeah.

07:48.277 --> 07:50.379
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, don't rush off.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.881
I want to dish
about married life.

07:52.915 --> 07:54.549
It's perplexing, actually.

07:54.584 --> 07:57.085
Ever since the wedding,
Booth seems to think

07:57.120 --> 07:59.388
that everything
is miraculously evolved.

07:59.422 --> 08:02.090
Food tastes better,
sex is more passionate,

08:02.125 --> 08:03.992
even the sun is hotter,

08:04.026 --> 08:06.862
which I tell him is merely due
to climate change.

08:06.896 --> 08:08.497
Are you really telling me
that you don't feel

08:08.531 --> 08:09.898
any different
now that you're married?

08:09.932 --> 08:11.233
Why would I?

08:11.267 --> 08:14.403
Our situation
is essentially unchanged.

08:14.437 --> 08:18.607
I think the wedding happened
too quickly for you.

08:18.641 --> 08:20.075
There was no natural transition.

08:20.109 --> 08:21.376
You didn't even have

08:21.411 --> 08:23.645
a bachelorette party
to help you say good-bye

08:23.679 --> 08:25.147
to your single life.

08:25.181 --> 08:26.615
We have to fix that.

08:26.649 --> 08:28.850
But I'm already married.
I know, sweetie,

08:28.885 --> 08:31.453
but it's not official until
you have a bachelorette party.

08:31.487 --> 08:32.921
We could have

08:32.955 --> 08:35.157
a potluck dinner
with our husbands

08:35.191 --> 08:36.457
and significant others.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.092
That's not a party.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.294
I'm talking
about a girl's night out.

08:40.328 --> 08:42.798
Like booze

08:42.832 --> 08:45.801
and flirting and dancing
and more booze

08:45.835 --> 08:47.269
and more flirting.

08:47.303 --> 08:48.804
Thank you, but no.

08:48.838 --> 08:50.138
I should go.

08:50.173 --> 08:51.440
Booth is waiting for me.

08:51.474 --> 08:53.675
Booth comes first now, huh?

08:53.709 --> 08:54.943
That's not true.

08:54.977 --> 08:57.345
Christine comes first,

08:57.380 --> 08:58.814
then Booth.

08:58.848 --> 09:01.249
Do I even make the top ten?

09:02.485 --> 09:04.586
Definitely.

09:11.060 --> 09:12.394
Bachelorette party, seriously?

09:12.428 --> 09:13.728
Yes.

09:13.763 --> 09:15.831
I told her it was
a little late for that.

09:15.865 --> 09:17.432
Then she asked me

09:17.467 --> 09:19.835
if she was still
in my top ten people.

09:19.869 --> 09:21.536
Oh, boy.
Which she is,

09:21.571 --> 09:23.091
even though
you don't like her anymore.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.106
Oh, geez.
Why do you keep uttering

09:25.141 --> 09:27.142
nonspecific
and meaningless exclamations?

09:27.176 --> 09:29.778
Did you say no
to Angela because of me?

09:29.812 --> 09:32.814
Well, I know how you feel,
and I didn't want

09:32.849 --> 09:34.683
to make you even more
uncomfortable just because...

09:34.717 --> 09:36.151
Okay, look, Bones,

09:36.185 --> 09:37.552
Angela is your best friend,
and obviously,

09:37.587 --> 09:39.254
I've come between you two.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.490
Well, if I have to choose...
You don't have to choose.

09:41.524 --> 09:44.059
You can have both;
you should have both.

09:44.093 --> 09:47.562
Look, you know, let her throw
you a bachelorette party.

09:47.597 --> 09:48.763
That's what a best friend does.

09:48.798 --> 09:50.165
I mean, you can't deny her that.

09:50.199 --> 09:52.000
Are you sure?
Yes.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.168
I'm positive.

09:53.202 --> 09:55.170
Sounded fun.

09:55.204 --> 09:56.605
Angela said there would be

09:56.639 --> 09:59.307
excessive alcohol consumption
and flirting.

09:59.342 --> 10:02.310
Oh, wow.
More exclamations.

10:02.345 --> 10:04.813
Let's just, you know,
focus on work for a while, okay?

10:04.847 --> 10:06.681
Sure.
Yeah.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.686
Donut dogs,

10:11.721 --> 10:13.622
grilled cheese flavored
chips, are you kidding me?

10:13.656 --> 10:15.090
Wow, chocolate covered
graham cracker cereals?

10:15.124 --> 10:16.658
(chuckles)

10:16.692 --> 10:19.861
All this junk food must've
caused some deaths, too.

10:19.896 --> 10:22.497
Wow, look at this, huh?
Yogurt drink box,

10:22.532 --> 10:25.000
all natural flavoring.
What does that mean?

10:25.034 --> 10:26.434
Cat urine could be
a natural flavor.

10:26.469 --> 10:27.702
WOMAN:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:27.737 --> 10:28.870
Since Howard disappeared,

10:28.905 --> 10:30.539
I've been run off my feet.

10:30.573 --> 10:32.274
I assume you're here
to tell me he's deceased?

10:32.308 --> 10:33.942
Yes, murdered.

10:33.976 --> 10:35.877
I see.

10:35.912 --> 10:37.379
That's upsetting.

10:37.413 --> 10:39.748
Did he die at Kettle Top Stew?

10:39.782 --> 10:41.583
Well, how did you know?
I didn't murder Howard,

10:41.617 --> 10:43.518
if that's what you're thinking.

10:43.553 --> 10:45.854
I'm a bromatologist
with acute hyperosmia.

10:45.888 --> 10:47.122
BOOTH: What?
She's a food scientist

10:47.156 --> 10:50.292
with a highly refined
olfactory sense.

10:50.326 --> 10:52.327
She has a very good sense
of smell.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.262
You're saying you could smell
where Howard was murdered?

10:54.297 --> 10:55.463
I've spent the last decade

10:55.498 --> 10:57.899
differentiating the 10,000 odors

10:57.934 --> 10:59.734
humans are capable of smelling.

10:59.769 --> 11:01.670
On her, I discerned

11:01.704 --> 11:03.738
a subtle yet
unmistakable bouquet

11:03.773 --> 11:05.240
of Kettle Top Stew
and antiseptic wash.

11:05.274 --> 11:06.274
Are you a coroner?

11:06.309 --> 11:09.744
Forensic
anthropologist.

11:09.779 --> 11:12.180
Howard and I developed
the recipe for that stew.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.415
BOOTH:
Well, now that Howard's dead,

11:13.449 --> 11:15.450
the company's
all yours, correct?

11:15.484 --> 11:16.718
No.

11:16.752 --> 11:17.953
I'm merely an employee

11:17.987 --> 11:19.154
with a small profit
participation.

11:19.188 --> 11:20.155
Would you care
to hear my theory?

11:20.189 --> 11:21.823
Yes.
I think Howard

11:21.857 --> 11:23.491
was working on something
that could have been

11:23.526 --> 11:25.427
worth a considerable
amount of money.

11:25.461 --> 11:27.362
Something bigger
than Lava Chips.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.798
Unfortunately, he did
not consult with me.

11:29.832 --> 11:31.032
But I could analyze
his formulas,

11:31.067 --> 11:32.667
calculate
the bliss-point,

11:32.702 --> 11:34.336
see if any are worthy of murder.
BOOTH: Uh, no.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.971
We have, uh, guys that do that.

11:36.005 --> 11:38.573
See, we have
a search warrant here.

11:40.109 --> 11:41.876
If you have
any questions,

11:41.911 --> 11:43.211
I'd be glad
to help.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.347
Perhaps if I smelled
Howard in person...

11:45.381 --> 11:49.317
I find I'm quite saddened
by Howard's death.

11:49.352 --> 11:51.453
It's a common
by-product of death.

11:51.487 --> 11:53.722
Hmm.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.090
(quietly):
Amazing.

11:55.124 --> 11:56.925
She remind you of
anyone you might know?

11:56.959 --> 11:59.027
No.

11:59.061 --> 12:00.462
But I find her

12:00.496 --> 12:02.197
quite unique
and delightful.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.900
Hey, Daisy.

12:05.935 --> 12:08.136
(sighs) I hate Oliver.
Who doesn't?

12:08.170 --> 12:09.604
But after a while you
start to like hating him.

12:09.639 --> 12:11.039
Yeah, I'm not there yet.
Hey, listen.

12:11.073 --> 12:12.507
I ran an analysis on
the contents of the stew

12:12.541 --> 12:13.875
and I figured out why it
failed its quality check.

12:13.909 --> 12:15.276
Because it
was full of

12:15.311 --> 12:17.312
a human... who I wish
was Oliver Wells?

12:17.346 --> 12:18.546
Nope. The meat
from the corpse

12:18.581 --> 12:20.281
did not impact
flavor at all. Look.

12:20.316 --> 12:22.651
The stew was
over-spiced.

12:22.685 --> 12:23.885
Excessive amounts
of garlic powder,

12:23.919 --> 12:25.286
red pepper
and oregano.

12:25.321 --> 12:26.655
But my understanding
is that

12:26.689 --> 12:28.056
the assembly line
is fully automated.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.257
The computers would
have parsed out

12:29.291 --> 12:30.392
uniform amounts
of each spice.

12:30.426 --> 12:31.826
Yeah, exactly,
which means

12:31.861 --> 12:33.895
the extra spices were
not added by the computer.

12:33.929 --> 12:36.331
Do you think
the killer added spice

12:36.365 --> 12:38.400
to help obscure the scent
of stewed human being?

12:38.434 --> 12:40.902
It's possible.

12:40.936 --> 12:43.004
Oliver Wells should
not antagonize me.

12:43.039 --> 12:44.506
Working here has given me
a pretty good knowledge

12:44.540 --> 12:46.541
of how to kill and
how to get away with it.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.576
Okay, I'm gonna go
out on a limb and ask:

12:48.611 --> 12:50.845
Daisy, do you want me
to have a chat with Oliver?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.113
No. What?

12:52.148 --> 12:53.381
No, no.
Not necessary.

12:53.416 --> 12:54.616
Big girl here.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.918
But if you want to,
do it.

12:56.952 --> 12:59.220
Who am I
to cramp your style?

12:59.255 --> 13:01.790
(sighs)

13:01.824 --> 13:05.393
Schools are considered
second-tier markets,

13:05.428 --> 13:07.028
along with prisons,
senior citizens' homes...

13:07.063 --> 13:08.396
SWEETS:
Schools.

13:08.431 --> 13:09.998
Where children
are our future?

13:10.032 --> 13:11.533
And where ketchup
is a vegetable.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.601
I didn't
make the laws.

13:13.636 --> 13:15.470
Besides, a child's palate
isn't developed yet.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.338
They don't care.
Wow.

13:17.373 --> 13:20.809
Dr. Sweets, the food
is perfectly healthy.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.644
It simply didn't
pass muster

13:22.678 --> 13:24.679
with our more
discerning customers.

13:24.714 --> 13:26.881
Do you think Tryon Foods is
going to survive this scandal?

13:26.916 --> 13:28.450
We will discontinue
that product line

13:28.484 --> 13:30.051
and just give the stew another name.
Mm-hmm.

13:30.086 --> 13:31.553
And you hired
Howard Compton

13:31.587 --> 13:32.954
as a consultant?

13:32.988 --> 13:34.189
Yes.

13:34.223 --> 13:36.224
He had a proven
track record

13:36.258 --> 13:38.159
in making foods
irresistible.

13:38.194 --> 13:39.761
With our Kettle Top Stew,
he was developing

13:39.795 --> 13:41.863
a healthier, low-sodium
version of the brand.

13:41.897 --> 13:43.398
Don't you already have
internal people for this?

13:43.432 --> 13:44.833
Yes.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.769
But Howard was the brains
behind Lava Chips.

13:47.803 --> 13:49.070
I was going
to offer him

13:49.105 --> 13:50.772
a permanent
job with us.

13:50.806 --> 13:51.973
I thought you
already had

13:52.007 --> 13:53.041
a head of research
and development.

13:53.075 --> 13:55.043
Yes,
Susan Lauderbach.

13:55.077 --> 13:57.212
She would keep her job,
but report to Howard.

13:57.246 --> 13:58.880
Okay.

13:58.914 --> 14:00.648
So she was passed over
for the promotion.

14:00.683 --> 14:02.650
After working
for you for years.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.820
Susan's a wonderful person.

14:05.855 --> 14:09.324
I would trust her
with my life.

14:09.358 --> 14:11.826
Maybe you couldn't
trust her with Howard's.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.707
I just don't understand.

14:16.741 --> 14:17.941
I mean, what's wrong with food

14:17.943 --> 14:19.210
that's grown in the ground

14:19.244 --> 14:20.377
rather than something that has

14:20.412 --> 14:22.346
a chemistry set
poured on top of it?

14:22.523 --> 14:25.158
Well, the argument is that
genetically modified crops

14:25.293 --> 14:27.094
improve yields

14:27.128 --> 14:29.229
and require
fewer pesticides.

14:29.263 --> 14:30.297
GMOs haven't
improved yields

14:30.331 --> 14:32.299
or significantly
decreased

14:32.333 --> 14:34.034
pesticide use.
It's just another way

14:34.068 --> 14:35.736
for industrial farming
to make money

14:35.770 --> 14:37.804
without even bothering
to discover the risks

14:37.839 --> 14:40.607
associated with genetically
modifying our food.

14:40.641 --> 14:42.175
I'll go.
I'd like to have one.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.643
Uh... what?

14:43.678 --> 14:44.811
Where are you going?

14:44.846 --> 14:47.047
And what are
you having?

14:47.081 --> 14:48.615
I thought you didn't
want to eat GMOs.

14:48.649 --> 14:50.283
No, the bachelorette party.

14:50.318 --> 14:51.618
I was wrong
to dismiss you.

14:51.652 --> 14:52.853
You really have

14:52.887 --> 14:54.054
to work on your
transitions, Sweetie...

14:54.088 --> 14:55.288
but that's...

14:55.323 --> 14:56.790
that's great!
Transitions?

14:56.824 --> 14:58.258
Why do I have
to work on them

14:58.292 --> 14:59.760
if it's great?

14:59.794 --> 15:00.961
No, I think she means
the bachelorette party.

15:00.995 --> 15:02.062
She's happy
you agreed.

15:02.096 --> 15:03.930
This is a very

15:03.965 --> 15:05.298
confusing
conversation.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.700
Forget that.

15:06.734 --> 15:08.535
Oh, my God, we're all
gonna have so much fun!

15:08.569 --> 15:09.936
All?

15:09.971 --> 15:12.172
Yes, I can't have
a party without you.

15:12.206 --> 15:13.740
So when are we gonna do this?

15:13.775 --> 15:14.975
Tonight.

15:15.009 --> 15:16.476
What? No, no.

15:16.511 --> 15:17.677
We have a case.

15:17.712 --> 15:19.079
The wedding was
planned in a day.

15:19.113 --> 15:20.881
It's tradition.
And you have two interns.

15:20.915 --> 15:22.949
I'm not sure.

15:22.984 --> 15:25.185
It's fine with Cam.
It is?

15:25.219 --> 15:26.453
Totally.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.722
And I know
the best place ever.

15:28.883 --> 15:31.318
There's this country-western bar
outside of town.

15:31.352 --> 15:33.320
It's got this bull
that we can ride,

15:33.354 --> 15:35.989
and there's line dancing,
and there's these

15:36.023 --> 15:37.190
hot guys in chaps...

15:37.225 --> 15:38.458
some of whom
aren't even gay.

15:38.493 --> 15:39.926
I do like horses,

15:39.961 --> 15:42.229
so I will feel very
comfortable there.

15:42.263 --> 15:43.630
(laughs)

15:47.034 --> 15:48.235
Kill Howard Compton?

15:48.269 --> 15:49.603
Me?

15:49.637 --> 15:51.171
Why would I do that?
Well, let's see...

15:51.205 --> 15:52.506
I mean, he was gonna
take your job.

15:52.540 --> 15:53.840
I mean,
there's motive there.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.042
He was found in
the factory where you work.

15:56.077 --> 15:58.011
I mean, you tested the stew and
you sent it out for canning.

15:58.045 --> 16:00.780
This case sort of prosecutes
itself, <i>cherie.</i> - Yeah.

16:00.815 --> 16:02.048
And I appreciate that,

16:02.083 --> 16:03.350
because I have a big workload.

16:03.384 --> 16:05.585
I didn't kill him.
I liked Howard.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.487
Whoa, whoa.
That's not true.

16:07.522 --> 16:09.689
CAROLINE: Maybe you tried
to steal his work?

16:09.724 --> 16:11.691
The formula for putting

16:11.726 --> 16:14.194
meat flavoring
into the... meat?

16:14.228 --> 16:16.263
That just seems crazy,
doesn't it?

16:16.297 --> 16:17.797
Processing
removes flavor

16:17.832 --> 16:19.799
which has to be replaced
through additives.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.301
Otherwise,
it's tasteless.

16:21.335 --> 16:22.936
And I wasn't
stealing it.

16:22.970 --> 16:24.437
We were working
on it together.

16:24.472 --> 16:27.340
But he was still gonna
be offered your job.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.376
Think about what
the jury's gonna say

16:29.410 --> 16:30.777
about all this.

16:30.811 --> 16:32.746
Okay, so I hated him a little.

16:32.780 --> 16:34.447
But I didn't
kill him.

16:34.482 --> 16:36.616
Where were you five days ago?
Five days ago?

16:36.651 --> 16:37.657
That's when he was killed?

16:37.682 --> 16:39.052
CAROLINE: You want to check
your day planner?

16:39.053 --> 16:40.487
Maybe it says
"kill Howard."

16:40.521 --> 16:41.788
That'll jog
your memory.

16:41.822 --> 16:44.224
That was a Thursday.

16:44.258 --> 16:45.625
I was out of town.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.594
Doing research on
the use of invertebrates

16:47.628 --> 16:48.862
as an alternative
form of protein.

16:48.896 --> 16:51.198
I'm sorr...
inverte-what?

16:51.232 --> 16:52.365
Bugs, Agent Booth.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.700
If we put more
bugs in our food,

16:53.734 --> 16:55.001
we'd have
a much cheaper

16:55.036 --> 16:56.503
and better source
of protein.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.438
Bug jerky?
Bug burgers?

16:58.472 --> 17:00.307
That isn't gonna
happen on my watch.

17:00.341 --> 17:01.708
Okay, you have
anyone who can,

17:01.742 --> 17:03.210
uh, I don't know,
corroborate this story?

17:03.244 --> 17:05.377
There were 12 other
researchers in the lab.

17:05.413 --> 17:06.713
We worked all night.

17:06.747 --> 17:09.415
And for your information,
fried crickets

17:09.450 --> 17:10.584
are a wonderful snack food

17:10.617 --> 17:12.886
with no empty calories.
Okay.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.221
That's... exciting.
Looks like I won't be

17:14.255 --> 17:15.722
going to her
house for dinner.

17:16.991 --> 17:18.925
You ladies are
actually leaving?

17:18.960 --> 17:20.227
Yes.

17:20.261 --> 17:22.561
You and Oliver should
be fine for the night.

17:22.597 --> 17:24.231
I've never seen you leave
during a case before.

17:24.265 --> 17:25.598
The case is progressing.

17:25.633 --> 17:29.236
Dr. Wells is capable
of further examination.

17:29.270 --> 17:30.904
I've left a detailed list

17:30.938 --> 17:32.305
of what I expect accomplished

17:32.340 --> 17:33.440
upon my return in the morning.

17:33.474 --> 17:35.709
What about me?
I'm capable.

17:35.743 --> 17:37.010
You're coming with us.

17:37.044 --> 17:38.278
Really?!

17:38.312 --> 17:39.646
Unless you
don't want to.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.182
Of course I do.

17:42.216 --> 17:43.450
I can't believe this!

17:43.484 --> 17:45.619
We're homies!

17:45.653 --> 17:47.754
Right.
Okay, so...

17:47.788 --> 17:49.389
This means that I'm
in charge of the lab,

17:49.390 --> 17:50.924
so I'll stay on him.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.059
As long as you realize this case
comes to a grinding halt

17:53.094 --> 17:54.794
without
my expertise.

17:54.829 --> 17:56.429
If I may...
when I was cleaning the bones,

17:56.464 --> 17:58.465
I noticed
partially remodeled

17:58.499 --> 18:00.033
comminuted
fractures

18:00.067 --> 18:01.601
to the right
anterior carpals

18:01.636 --> 18:03.169
and metacarpals.

18:03.204 --> 18:05.272
Did you run
a microscopic analysis

18:05.306 --> 18:07.374
to determine the age
of the injury?

18:07.408 --> 18:08.908
I did.
WELLS: Only because I told her to.

18:08.943 --> 18:12.245
Your need for attention
is exhausting.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.914
The fractures are
approximately two weeks old.

18:14.949 --> 18:17.317
According to the victim's
medical file, two weeks ago,

18:17.351 --> 18:19.085
he got a prescription
for codeine,

18:19.120 --> 18:20.453
claiming
to his doctor

18:20.488 --> 18:22.522
that he hurt his
hand during a fall.

18:22.556 --> 18:24.824
So it's a reasonable explanation.
Well, no, a fall

18:24.859 --> 18:26.993
most likely would have
resulted in a Colles' fracture,

18:27.028 --> 18:28.595
not a comminuted one,

18:28.629 --> 18:30.096
which is most
commonly associated

18:30.131 --> 18:31.731
with blunt
force trauma.

18:31.766 --> 18:33.400
If someone smashed
in the guy's hand,

18:33.434 --> 18:35.368
why would Compton
lie about it?

18:35.403 --> 18:36.736
Well, maybe
the victim was scared

18:36.771 --> 18:38.338
that something worse might
happen if he talked.

18:38.372 --> 18:39.506
Like getting murdered.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.308
This is excellent work,
Dr. Wells.

18:41.342 --> 18:42.842
I hope that
it continues

18:42.877 --> 18:44.044
and I'm not disappointed
on my return

18:44.078 --> 18:45.111
and I don't have
to dismiss you.

18:45.146 --> 18:47.013
Until morning.

18:50.851 --> 18:52.052
It's you and me,
brother.

18:52.086 --> 18:54.854
But I'm in charge.

18:54.889 --> 18:57.023
SWEETS: You did a good
thing, Booth.

18:57.058 --> 18:59.292
I know you and Angela
haven't exactly been friends lately.

18:59.327 --> 19:00.994
Oh, wait a second,
this wasn't about Angela.

19:01.028 --> 19:02.595
I just wanted Bones to have
a bachelorette party.

19:02.630 --> 19:04.764
Okay.
"Okay"? Don't say "okay" to me.

19:04.799 --> 19:06.232
Okay.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.335
That wasn't an "okay" okay,
it was just an okay.

19:08.369 --> 19:10.737
See, you don't even know
how to say just "okay."

19:10.771 --> 19:12.105
Okay...
You said...

19:12.139 --> 19:13.940
All right, forget it.
You know what?

19:13.974 --> 19:17.043
Susan Lauderbach's alibi
is rock solid.

19:17.078 --> 19:18.411
All the other bug-eaters
vouched for her.

19:18.446 --> 19:19.679
So what's next?

19:19.714 --> 19:21.281
Well, according
to squint central,

19:21.315 --> 19:22.482
Compton's hand

19:22.516 --> 19:24.451
was bludgeoned
pretty bad

19:24.485 --> 19:25.685
about two weeks ago.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.220
Then he lied to
his doctor about it.

19:27.254 --> 19:28.688
He didn't report it
to the police, either.

19:28.723 --> 19:31.024
But he did call them
before the injury.

19:31.058 --> 19:32.792
Keep reading, huh?

19:32.827 --> 19:34.127
'Cause he thought somebody
was following him. - Oh, okay.

19:34.161 --> 19:35.395
He thought he was
being followed,

19:35.429 --> 19:37.030
a car tried to run
him off the road.

19:37.064 --> 19:38.998
Next day, his front
tire was slashed.

19:39.033 --> 19:40.400
A week later,
he's assaulted.

19:40.434 --> 19:41.768
Two weeks later
he's murdered.

19:41.802 --> 19:42.869
This is the activity

19:42.903 --> 19:44.070
of someone obsessed
with Compton.

19:44.105 --> 19:45.905
Now, as the
obsession grows,

19:45.940 --> 19:47.107
the actions become
more violent.

19:47.141 --> 19:49.409
Mmm. Ex-girlfriend?

19:49.443 --> 19:51.311
If an ex was stalking him,
I don't think he would have

19:51.345 --> 19:53.480
reported the first incident
to the police.

19:53.514 --> 19:55.582
Cops had a make
and the license plate of the car,

19:55.616 --> 19:56.937
but the DMV couldn't
find a match.

19:56.951 --> 19:58.151
He was being followed,
you know?

19:58.185 --> 20:00.687
He probably had
trouble encoding

20:00.721 --> 20:01.921
visual stimuli.

20:01.956 --> 20:03.256
Could've switched
letters to numbers...

20:03.290 --> 20:04.457
I could come up with
a list of alternatives.

20:04.492 --> 20:06.126
See, now that
is helpful.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.327
Okay.

20:07.361 --> 20:08.728
See? That's a good
"okay," too.

20:08.763 --> 20:09.996
That was a good one?
Yes.

20:10.030 --> 20:12.265
HODGINS:
<i>Compton's computer, here,</i>

20:12.299 --> 20:14.067
has the formulas
for the new food products

20:14.101 --> 20:15.735
he was working on
when he died.

20:15.770 --> 20:19.038
Considering some of these snack
foods are worth billions,

20:19.073 --> 20:20.907
I bet some of those formulas were
worth killing for.

20:20.941 --> 20:24.110
Man, the chemicals and additives
in this stuff, it's outrageous.

20:24.145 --> 20:25.979
Your hot sauce would've interested him.
Hey.

20:26.013 --> 20:28.281
Our hot sauce is not junk food,
thank you very much.

20:28.315 --> 20:29.716
There are
no preservatives,

20:29.750 --> 20:32.752
no artificial flavors,
all organic

20:32.787 --> 20:34.754
and all natural.
Oh, I like it.

20:34.789 --> 20:36.222
I have it every morning
on my eggs.

20:36.257 --> 20:37.791
Wait, you buy it?
Yeah.

20:37.825 --> 20:38.958
Is it not
selling?

20:38.993 --> 20:41.161
Yeah, no,
10,000 cases so far.

20:41.195 --> 20:42.662
Well, that's
a beginning.

20:42.696 --> 20:44.197
Although you did
lose billions,

20:44.231 --> 20:46.533
so that's barely
a raindrop in the ocean.

20:46.567 --> 20:47.834
Okay, for-for
a minute there

20:47.868 --> 20:49.068
I thought you
were nice, Oliver.

20:49.103 --> 20:50.937
Well, I'm trying.

20:50.971 --> 20:53.306
I mean, you're the only person around
here that I can tolerate.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.408
Probably because
we share a similar look

20:55.443 --> 20:59.012
so I endow you with an interest
and an intelligence

20:59.046 --> 21:00.513
that you may not
even possess.

21:00.548 --> 21:01.781
Let's just work.

21:01.816 --> 21:03.316
Okay.

21:03.350 --> 21:04.818
This has potential.

21:04.852 --> 21:07.120
"Butter Boy."

21:07.154 --> 21:10.790
High fructose corn syrup,
soy, sugar, salt.

21:12.026 --> 21:13.660
(crunches)

21:13.694 --> 21:15.662
That's a tasty little
nugget of obesity.

21:15.696 --> 21:16.863
All right.

21:16.897 --> 21:18.631
How about this?
"Meat-Pops."

21:18.666 --> 21:20.467
Preservatives
up the wazoo

21:20.501 --> 21:22.402
and artificial pretty
much everything else.

21:22.436 --> 21:23.870
Man, I am not
touching that.

21:25.172 --> 21:26.372
All right.
"Hot Bacon."

21:26.407 --> 21:27.640
Well, this
has to be

21:27.675 --> 21:30.076
some kind of condiment
or something.

21:31.145 --> 21:33.746
It's pretty good,
actually.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.450
That stuff
is awesome.

21:37.485 --> 21:38.718
Seriously,
try that.

21:38.752 --> 21:39.719
Oh, my God,
it's like bacon

21:39.753 --> 21:40.887
is cooking

21:40.921 --> 21:42.322
right inside my mouth.
Oh.

21:43.257 --> 21:44.557
Ooh, that's pay dirt.

21:44.592 --> 21:46.159
I mean, who doesn't
love bacon, right?

21:46.193 --> 21:48.495
Okay, let's see what
happened in the testing.

21:48.529 --> 21:50.563
Mmm...

21:50.598 --> 21:52.232
Wait.

21:52.266 --> 21:55.602
There are a whole mess
of emails about Hot Bacon

21:55.636 --> 21:57.437
from someone named
Raymond McCants.

21:57.471 --> 21:59.906
"Compton, your delays
are costing me millions!

21:59.940 --> 22:03.142
Produce and deliver
my product, or you'll pay!"

22:03.177 --> 22:06.246
Okay. According to his
patent application,

22:06.280 --> 22:10.049
Hot Bacon is not a food product.
It's a...

22:10.084 --> 22:13.887
it's a bacon-flavored...

22:13.921 --> 22:16.022
sexual lubricant.

22:16.991 --> 22:18.258
Ah!

22:18.292 --> 22:20.126
Uh!

22:20.160 --> 22:22.095
Definitely worth
killing for.

22:22.129 --> 22:23.930
Oh, God.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:35.276 --> 22:37.477
(bus door opens, shuts)

22:45.986 --> 22:48.621
I really need
a drink.

22:49.456 --> 22:51.291
(chuckles)

22:51.325 --> 22:52.959
(cow bellows in distance)

22:54.155 --> 22:58.102
Porn? I'm not in porn.
Sexual toys are not porn.

22:58.103 --> 23:00.137
They have another name.
Guess what that other name is.

23:00.172 --> 23:01.505
Okay, sir,
you need to relax

23:01.540 --> 23:03.340
Marital aids. Porn!

23:03.375 --> 23:05.810
I'm in the business of helping
people who love each other,

23:05.844 --> 23:07.511
<i>love</i> each other.

23:07.546 --> 23:08.879
Right. You're a boon
to society.

23:08.914 --> 23:10.281
That's exactly
what I am.

23:10.315 --> 23:13.851
Did you send these
e-mails, Mr. McCants?

23:13.885 --> 23:15.920
Oh, right.

23:15.954 --> 23:17.221
I'll take that as a yes.

23:17.255 --> 23:18.455
You think I threatened Howard?

23:18.457 --> 23:19.857
Let's take
a look here.

23:19.891 --> 23:22.493
"If you bail on me,
you will live to regret it.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.662
I will hunt you down,
and shove the largest..."

23:24.696 --> 23:26.736
He kept missing delivery dates
on a particular item,

23:26.765 --> 23:28.232
but I didn't kill him.

23:28.266 --> 23:29.333
And what item would that be?

23:29.367 --> 23:32.269
Bacon-flavored lube.
We had a contract.

23:32.304 --> 23:33.604
"Bacon-flavored lube"?

23:33.638 --> 23:35.172
Intrigued, right?

23:35.207 --> 23:37.775
Bacon and sex.
Tough to pick a favorite.

23:37.809 --> 23:40.711
Put them together, and that's
what magic is, my friend.

23:40.746 --> 23:42.279
That's why there's bacon
cologne, bacon condoms.

23:42.314 --> 23:44.048
But time is money
in the lube game.

23:44.082 --> 23:45.683
Someone else could have
cornered that market first.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.185
So, you send him a few
threatening e-mails...

23:48.220 --> 23:50.187
Bluster. I bluster.

23:50.222 --> 23:51.655
Howard ignores you.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.091
You get mad, so you
follow him home one night.

23:54.126 --> 23:56.794
No, you got it wrong.
You slash his tire, you break his hand.

23:56.828 --> 23:58.829
Finally, you follow him to the
factory, where you kill him,

23:58.864 --> 24:00.564
and you feed him into
the meat machine.

24:00.599 --> 24:03.267
I'm not saying another word.
I'm a businessman.

24:03.301 --> 24:05.770
And smart businessmen know,
not to talk to the Feds,

24:05.804 --> 24:07.138
not without a lawyer.
Okay.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.339
One question.
Hmm?

24:08.373 --> 24:09.507
The name "meat machine."

24:09.541 --> 24:11.542
You know
if that's copyrighted?

24:11.576 --> 24:13.477
All right.

24:16.047 --> 24:19.717
MAN: Speed freaks, getting up
to the top of that hill.

24:27.692 --> 24:31.829
Okay! Okay, uh, this used
to be a country-western bar.

24:31.863 --> 24:35.900
BRENNAN: This reminds me of a place
I went to in Somalia.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.935
SAROYAN: Exactly. We should
turn around and try

24:37.969 --> 24:39.236
to salvage
a good night's sleep.

24:39.271 --> 24:42.606
Why?!
No, this is my party.

24:42.641 --> 24:45.342
Seriously, I think I sent
that big one there to prison.

24:45.377 --> 24:49.246
I like it rough, but only if there's
a safe word.

24:49.281 --> 24:53.117
Well, they are looking at us
like we're on the menu.

24:53.151 --> 24:54.518
Aw, they're just guys.

24:54.553 --> 24:58.088
Big smelly guys,
but what are we afraid of?

24:58.123 --> 24:58.989
CAROLINE:
Me? Beheading.

24:59.024 --> 25:00.157
Look, we'll get a drink,

25:00.192 --> 25:01.492
and if it gets ugly,

25:01.526 --> 25:02.827
then we'll make a run for it.

25:02.861 --> 25:03.701
I would like a drink.

25:03.728 --> 25:04.962
SAROYAN:
Oh, God.

25:04.996 --> 25:08.098
That one back there is
definitely a fugitive.

25:08.133 --> 25:11.168
Five shots
with alcohol, please.

25:16.808 --> 25:19.510
Lube aftertaste
still haunting you?

25:19.544 --> 25:22.880
It lingers. I'm on
my fifth pack of gum.

25:22.914 --> 25:25.115
The right clavicle
has been trisected.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.517
On this medial angle,

25:26.551 --> 25:29.353
there is a perimortem
sharp force injury.

25:29.387 --> 25:31.322
A stabbing?

25:31.356 --> 25:32.523
See, if the attack,

25:32.557 --> 25:35.626
came at a downward-
facing angle,

25:35.660 --> 25:37.862
then the stabbing implement
would have severed

25:37.896 --> 25:40.431
the subclavian artery coming
directly off the aorta.

25:40.465 --> 25:42.733
Meaning he bled out.

25:42.767 --> 25:45.369
See that?
The annoying girl leaves,

25:45.403 --> 25:47.338
and we immediately find
the cause of death.

25:47.372 --> 25:48.405
Okay,

25:48.440 --> 25:49.940
about Daisy.

25:49.975 --> 25:51.542
There is nothing
that you could say

25:51.576 --> 25:52.910
that would make me like her.

25:52.944 --> 25:55.212
Oliver, she is one of us.
You are not, yet.

25:55.247 --> 25:57.615
The fastest way for you
to become one of us

25:57.649 --> 26:00.184
is to be kind to her.

26:00.218 --> 26:04.889
What if I don't care
about being one of you?

26:04.923 --> 26:07.324
I think you do.

26:07.359 --> 26:09.593
Good job on the
clavicle thing.

26:14.399 --> 26:16.033
I noticed that Howard Compton's
tire was slashed

26:16.067 --> 26:18.636
less than a month before
he was stabbed to death.

26:18.670 --> 26:19.565
Okay.

26:20.137 --> 26:22.274
Well, it could be
classic escalation.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.005
One day you stab
a guy's tire...

26:24.006 --> 26:24.747
...a few weeks later,

26:24.748 --> 26:27.316
you stab him. Okay, that's
great. How's that help?

26:27.350 --> 26:29.251
Well, maybe the lab can compare
what stabbed the tire

26:29.286 --> 26:30.352
with what stabbed the victim.

26:30.387 --> 26:35.591
Hey... that's good work
there, Sweets.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.126
What are you worried about?

26:37.160 --> 26:39.528
What do you mean?
You checked your watch.

26:40.697 --> 26:42.765
I'm just seeing what time it is.

26:42.799 --> 26:44.033
Is it the bachelorette party?

26:44.067 --> 26:45.901
Sweets, Caroline and Cam
are with Bones.

26:45.936 --> 26:47.803
I got a federal
prosecutor

26:47.838 --> 26:49.572
and a federal coroner
with Bones.

26:49.606 --> 26:51.440
I mean, how wild can it get?

26:51.475 --> 26:55.111

26:55.145 --> 26:58.948

28:04.181 --> 28:06.248
Ooh!

28:06.283 --> 28:09.718

a mating ritual!

28:09.753 --> 28:12.054
Huh?
Most men respond to the hair tossing

28:12.088 --> 28:14.523
and pelvic thrusts, which suggests sex.
I like it.

28:14.558 --> 28:15.991
(laughs)

28:16.026 --> 28:18.761
Hey, hey, hey!
You're married, remember?

28:18.795 --> 28:21.931
Not yet, Angela!
This is my bachelorette party!

28:21.965 --> 28:23.632
I am invoking Godel's
Closed Timelike

28:23.667 --> 28:26.635
Curve with
a Lorentzian manifold!

28:26.670 --> 28:30.506
Hey, Curves, what do you say
you and me go for a ride?

28:30.540 --> 28:31.774
On your motorcycle?

28:31.808 --> 28:34.109
No...
(both laugh)

28:34.144 --> 28:36.045
I volunteer to take her place.

28:36.079 --> 28:37.646
No, you don't.
She doesn't.

28:37.681 --> 28:40.916
This is a private party,
actually, so...

28:40.951 --> 28:42.851
(laughs)
CAM: Oh, God, here we go.

28:42.886 --> 28:44.119
Get lost, skank.

28:44.154 --> 28:45.621
Well, I am not a skank.

28:45.655 --> 28:47.189
What's a skank?
It sounds bad.

28:47.224 --> 28:49.692
Oh, it's not that bad.
I've been told I'm a skank.

28:49.726 --> 28:50.993
Hey, get lost.

28:51.027 --> 28:53.429
I've heard about bikers
and their hogs.

28:53.463 --> 28:55.564
This must be a hog.

28:55.599 --> 28:56.932
CAM:
Caroline! Gas on a fire.

28:56.967 --> 28:58.834
Your boyfriend is
far too unattractive

28:58.868 --> 29:00.869
for a women as exquisite
as myself.

29:00.904 --> 29:01.604
What?!

29:01.638 --> 29:03.739
But you on the other hand

29:03.773 --> 29:05.608
are a suitable match.

29:05.909 --> 29:07.710
ALL:
Oh!

29:07.744 --> 29:10.279
Go! Run!

29:11.615 --> 29:15.718
Wow. You know how bikers
always stick together?

29:15.752 --> 29:17.286
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.421
I think it applies
to the girlfriends, too.

29:19.456 --> 29:20.256
Catfight!

29:22.492 --> 29:24.059
(whimpers)

29:24.094 --> 29:26.128
Here we go!
Get over here!

29:27.264 --> 29:28.297
ALL:
Oh!

29:28.331 --> 29:29.798
Ooh, yeah!

29:31.468 --> 29:33.402
Oh!

29:33.436 --> 29:35.604
Take that!

29:41.878 --> 29:43.812
Oh! Take her off!

29:43.847 --> 29:45.080
(glass breaks)

29:45.115 --> 29:45.981
Get 'em!

29:46.016 --> 29:48.584
Punch her out!
(glass breaks)

29:52.633 --> 29:53.833
Yep.

29:53.867 --> 29:56.388
Although, I did not
start the fight,

29:56.638 --> 29:59.129
I felt obligated
to finish it.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.030
You would have been
(laughs) very proud of me.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.332
I would have.
Okay, come on.

30:02.366 --> 30:04.033
Let's just try to get
inside, all right?

30:04.068 --> 30:06.102
Oh! I got it.
God, did I do that?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.470
Okay, just sit down, have a seat.
Okay. (laughs)

30:07.471 --> 30:09.673
Okay, you know how many
favors I had to call in

30:09.707 --> 30:11.074
so you guys wouldn't
get arrested?

30:11.108 --> 30:12.542
Yes.

30:12.577 --> 30:13.743
Whoa!

30:13.778 --> 30:16.546
One, you called the sheriff,
and he let us go.

30:16.581 --> 30:17.881
This is really nice.

30:17.915 --> 30:19.316
It's nice, right? Yeah.
(laughs)

30:19.350 --> 30:21.685
But not before you tried
to steal his motorcycle.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.620
Come on up. There you go.

30:23.654 --> 30:25.822
I thought that was
Moose's motorcycle.

30:25.856 --> 30:27.123
She tried to punch Cam.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.192
Moose. Okay, now, why don't we
just get you upstairs?

30:29.227 --> 30:30.360
Come on. Come on.
No!

30:30.394 --> 30:32.362
No, it's too far.
This is good, this is great.

30:32.396 --> 30:33.830
All right, listen,
you know what?

30:33.864 --> 30:36.600
Just relax. I'm gonna go get you
a cold towel, all right?

30:36.634 --> 30:39.402
Oh, cushion's so soft.
I like this cushion.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.905
Hey, do you know
what it's called

30:41.939 --> 30:45.041
when you drink a shot
off of a stranger's body?

30:45.076 --> 30:46.376
Uh, I don't know. Body shots?

30:46.410 --> 30:48.545
How did you know that?
Oh! Lucky guess.

30:48.579 --> 30:51.681
Okay, here,
try this here. Ah... Oh.

30:51.716 --> 30:52.849
Oh, that feels, nice.

30:52.883 --> 30:54.323
Oh, it's nice, huh?
Did you have fun,

30:54.352 --> 30:55.885
or was it all about
the fighting?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.387
We danced on a bar.

30:57.421 --> 30:59.289
Wow.
In a line.

30:59.323 --> 31:00.457
Does that sound like fun?

31:00.491 --> 31:01.992
Sounds like a blast.

31:02.026 --> 31:06.930
I told Angela that it was
your idea that I should go.

31:06.964 --> 31:10.533
She feels bad
that she hated you.

31:10.568 --> 31:14.738
And I told her that you're
the best person ever... - Oh!

31:14.772 --> 31:17.641
...even though that can't be
confirmed empirically.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.075
But I don't give a crap.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.845
And then I told her some
of the things that we did

31:21.879 --> 31:23.413
in the bathtub last week and...

31:23.447 --> 31:25.482
No, no, no, no. You didn't say
about the bath tub, did you?

31:25.516 --> 31:27.081
Do you want to do
some of that right now?

31:27.106 --> 31:27.784
If we did that,

31:27.785 --> 31:29.452
you would drown, okay? Now let's
just get some sleep, all right?

31:29.487 --> 31:30.920
But I'm not tired.

31:30.955 --> 31:31.988
Okay. Shh.

31:32.023 --> 31:33.290
I'm not tired.

31:33.324 --> 31:34.391
Okay.

31:34.425 --> 31:36.092
I love you, Booth.

31:36.127 --> 31:39.963
I love you, too, Bones.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.867
All right. (sighs)

31:52.143 --> 31:54.377
(groans)

31:54.412 --> 31:56.813
This stuff
tastes like hate.

31:56.847 --> 31:58.148
That'd be the
lycopenes,

31:58.182 --> 31:59.783
Good for flushing
out toxins,

31:59.817 --> 32:02.819
but they all get stuck
on the tongue.

32:02.853 --> 32:04.087
Done.

32:04.121 --> 32:05.488
Ugh! And blech!

32:05.523 --> 32:07.123
You know,
I hate to admit it,

32:07.158 --> 32:09.492
but this is actually starting
to make me feel better.

32:09.527 --> 32:11.795
Good. Then we can get started.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.463
Oh!
Uh!

32:13.497 --> 32:15.832
DAISY: Can't you turn
the brightness down?

32:15.866 --> 32:19.002
No. While you were all drunk,
Dr. Hodgins and I investigated

32:19.036 --> 32:20.970
the victim's slashed tires.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.573
I took a cast
of the puncture marks,

32:23.607 --> 32:25.175
and I scanned it
into the Angelatron.

32:25.209 --> 32:26.676
Mm. Okay.
Well, my hand-eye coordination

32:26.711 --> 32:30.413
is starting to come back,
so let me see what I can do.

32:32.717 --> 32:36.252
Okay, so, the blade appears
to be 3.81 centimeters

32:36.287 --> 32:39.956
in width with a serrated
edge on one side,

32:39.990 --> 32:41.758
and a straight edge
on the other.

32:41.792 --> 32:43.226
Hmm. Could be
a hunting knife.

32:43.260 --> 32:45.195
Yeah, but what's odd, is...

32:45.229 --> 32:46.696
..it's curved.
Ah...

32:46.731 --> 32:49.899
there's my beautiful
pugilist wife.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.167
How ya doin'?

32:51.202 --> 32:54.637
Ugh. Have you been eating
bacon grease?

32:54.672 --> 32:57.040
What? No. You-You're
just hungover.

32:57.074 --> 32:58.441
I ran an analysis

32:58.476 --> 33:00.510
of the particulates
in the tire slash.

33:00.544 --> 33:02.679
So, I found traces of
honeysuckle, golden bell

33:02.713 --> 33:04.080
and confederate rose.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.849
Flowers?

33:05.883 --> 33:08.785
Yeah, I-I know what it is.

33:08.819 --> 33:09.919
I use this tool

33:09.954 --> 33:11.287
when I plant.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.656
The tire was stabbed

33:13.691 --> 33:16.092
by a Japanese garden knife.

33:18.596 --> 33:20.096
Okay, so Bones was feeling

33:20.131 --> 33:21.598
a little worse
for wear this morning.

33:21.632 --> 33:24.367
So, I thought you might need
a couple of coffee, huh?

33:24.402 --> 33:25.769
Please, <i>cherie.</i>

33:25.803 --> 33:27.237
That was not my first rodeo.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.739
Maybe a taste.
Ah-ha, okay.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.641
So, it turns out that
our victim made two transfers

33:31.675 --> 33:33.243
the same bank account
last month.

33:33.277 --> 33:34.677
$5,000 each.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.813
That's a lot of money. Who to?

33:36.847 --> 33:38.181
A woman by the name
of Evelyn Cheevers, okay?

33:38.215 --> 33:39.182
She runs the Coalition

33:39.216 --> 33:40.316
for Chemical Free Farming.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.818
Her license plate
is close enough

33:41.852 --> 33:44.320
to the one Compton
reported following him.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.822
Why would a food scientist

33:45.856 --> 33:48.024
be giving his money to someone

33:48.058 --> 33:50.260
whose goal was
to put him out of business?

33:50.294 --> 33:52.162
Maybe she found out
that he was putting

33:52.196 --> 33:53.463
something even nastier
in the food

33:53.497 --> 33:54.831
and he, you know,

33:54.865 --> 33:56.733
paid her off to-to keep quiet.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.668
Says here she runs
an organic garden nursery.

33:58.702 --> 34:00.236
Yeah, check this out.

34:00.271 --> 34:01.805
They sell the same
Japanese gardening knives

34:01.839 --> 34:03.907
that was used to slash
the victim's tire.

34:03.941 --> 34:06.342
I like it when you
don't make me work.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.244
Especially today.

34:08.279 --> 34:09.746
(chuckles)

34:13.284 --> 34:15.752
WOMAN: <i>Yes.</i>

34:15.786 --> 34:16.953
I slashed Howard's tire.

34:16.987 --> 34:18.388
I'm not denying it, Agent Booth.

34:18.422 --> 34:19.822
'Cause he stopped
paying you off, right?

34:19.857 --> 34:21.291
So, what did you have on him?

34:21.324 --> 34:23.793
I'm-I'm not a blackmailer.
I am a crusader.

34:23.828 --> 34:25.728
Aw, okay, that's an
interesting choice of word.

34:25.763 --> 34:28.097
Crusaders killed
for their cause.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.099
I didn't kill anyone.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.167
You were carrying
a weapon, okay?

34:31.202 --> 34:32.268
You targeted Howard Compton.

34:32.303 --> 34:33.902
Yes, I was following him.

34:33.938 --> 34:37.340
And again, yes, I slashed
his tire as a statement.

34:37.373 --> 34:39.309
But he caught me,
and I know you're going

34:39.342 --> 34:40.577
to find this hard to believe,

34:40.610 --> 34:41.643
but instead of calling
the police,

34:41.679 --> 34:43.545
he asked if we could talk.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.547
You're right.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.583
I find it hard to believe.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.650
Well, Howard was having
second thoughts.

34:48.686 --> 34:49.953
And he was actually reading

34:49.987 --> 34:51.387
some of my writing
and he found

34:51.422 --> 34:52.989
that he agreed
with what I'd been saying.

34:53.023 --> 34:56.458
Large elements of the food
industry are poisoning us.

34:56.494 --> 34:57.994
What about the money?

34:58.028 --> 35:00.063
He was funding our website
and our PR campaign.

35:00.097 --> 35:01.397
Okay, look.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.066
If he thought
he was poisoning people,

35:03.100 --> 35:05.034
why didn't he just quit his job?
He was going to.

35:05.069 --> 35:07.136
But he said there was someone
that he had to expose.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.239
And he had to be
on the inside to do it.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.374
Okay, and who was this someone?

35:11.408 --> 35:13.343
He didn't tell me.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.845
He said it was safer
for both of us if I didn't know.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.883
Look, I didn't kill Howard.

35:19.917 --> 35:23.987
He and I were on the same team.

35:26.123 --> 35:30.693
DAISY:
You should've seen this, Oliver.

35:30.728 --> 35:33.363
But you were expending too much
effort trying to undermine me.

35:33.397 --> 35:34.697
I assure you

35:34.732 --> 35:36.232
that takes no effort whatsoever.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.101
Why are you so horrible?

35:38.135 --> 35:39.402
I'm not.

35:39.436 --> 35:41.337
I'm that first sip
of a fine wine

35:41.372 --> 35:43.373
that you have not yet
learned to appreciate.

35:43.407 --> 35:45.375
You needed me, Ms. Wick?
Yes.

35:45.409 --> 35:47.510
Oliver made an error
on the microsil cast

35:47.545 --> 35:49.178
of the victim's clavicle.

35:49.213 --> 35:52.081
I now regret
my bachelorette party.

35:52.116 --> 35:54.217
This is the sharp force injury
to the victim's clavicle

35:54.251 --> 35:57.820
at 400 times magnification.

35:57.855 --> 35:59.088
See the half-moon
crescent notch?

35:59.123 --> 36:00.523
It's like whatever

36:00.558 --> 36:02.926
stabbed the victim
had a hole along the side.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.961
My first thought was a needle.

36:04.995 --> 36:06.462
Like what anesthesiologists use

36:06.497 --> 36:08.898
with a lateral irrigation hole.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.234
The only problem is the gauge
on the injury is too big.

36:11.268 --> 36:12.948
There aren't
any medical needles that size.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.404
That's because it isn't
a medical needle.

36:14.438 --> 36:18.074
It's an injector used
to marinate meat.

36:18.108 --> 36:19.709
Oh, my God, that's it.

36:19.743 --> 36:20.810
Of course it is.

36:20.844 --> 36:21.844
Excellent work, Ms. Wick.

36:21.845 --> 36:23.479
Uh, Dr. Brennan,

36:23.514 --> 36:25.048
it's important to note
that had I not tempered

36:25.082 --> 36:26.602
Ms. Wick's hangover,
she would've never

36:26.617 --> 36:27.917
found this evidence.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.686
So simple logic dictates

36:29.720 --> 36:31.220
that the credit should be mine.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.690
Shared at best, Dr. Wells.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.693
At best.

36:36.727 --> 36:39.128
A better man would say good job.

36:39.163 --> 36:40.730
It was excellent actually.

36:41.532 --> 36:42.765
And you're welcome.

36:46.276 --> 36:48.819
You recognize this?
It's a marinade injector.

36:48.820 --> 36:50.053
Mm-hmm, why do you recognize it?

36:50.088 --> 36:51.054
I designed it.

36:51.089 --> 36:52.255
With Howard.

36:52.290 --> 36:54.324
Is this what killed him?

36:54.359 --> 36:56.393
I guess the question is,
did you use this to kill Howard?

36:56.427 --> 36:57.761
No.

36:57.795 --> 36:58.996
You disliked him.

36:59.030 --> 37:00.364
I dislike almost everyone.

37:00.398 --> 37:02.399
I dislike you and I
don't even know you.

37:02.433 --> 37:04.968
Howard was gonna
dump his company.

37:05.003 --> 37:07.371
The same company you had
to work for for ten years

37:07.405 --> 37:08.739
before you saw a profit.

37:08.773 --> 37:10.340
It wouldn't be rational

37:10.375 --> 37:11.575
for me to kill Howard.

37:11.609 --> 37:12.609
It would remove the last hope

37:12.643 --> 37:13.803
of keeping the company alive.

37:13.811 --> 37:15.545
This wasn't a rational murder.

37:15.580 --> 37:16.747
You know what my guess is?

37:16.781 --> 37:18.415
My guess is that you begged him

37:18.449 --> 37:19.783
to keep the company alive,
he refused,

37:19.817 --> 37:22.119
and you killed him
out of rage.

37:22.153 --> 37:24.221
It was impulsive, spontaneous.

37:24.255 --> 37:26.890
I am neither of those things.
I don't suppose

37:26.924 --> 37:28.458
you've ever met
anyone like that.

37:28.493 --> 37:30.494
I know someone a lot like that.

37:30.528 --> 37:32.295
Would she murder someone
without a very good reason?

37:32.330 --> 37:34.731
No.

37:34.766 --> 37:36.967
Then I guess
what you'd better do

37:37.001 --> 37:39.569
is find a very good reason.

37:43.908 --> 37:45.575
Sweetie, we've got
something to show you.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.211
Just a little film that
Ms. Montenegro and I directed.

37:48.246 --> 37:50.113
Together.
I helped. Quite a lot.

37:50.148 --> 37:51.581
This is a recreation

37:51.616 --> 37:52.783
of the victim's death.

37:52.817 --> 37:54.017
See, once I saw
the meat injector

37:54.052 --> 37:55.452
that was used
to kill the victim,

37:55.486 --> 37:56.853
I got curious.

37:56.888 --> 37:57.921
But I'm the one who pointed out

37:57.955 --> 37:59.322
that most needles have a plunger

37:59.357 --> 38:01.558
or backstop that limits
the amount of fluid

38:01.592 --> 38:03.727
taken in or expressed.
The point is

38:03.761 --> 38:06.329
the needle on the marinade
injector was open-ended.

38:06.364 --> 38:07.497
Based on the angle

38:07.532 --> 38:09.166
that the victim was stabbed...

38:10.968 --> 38:12.269
(groans)

38:12.303 --> 38:13.670
It's still awful
every time I see it.

38:13.704 --> 38:15.005
Of course!

38:15.039 --> 38:17.074
Because the sub-clavian artery

38:17.108 --> 38:18.775
comes directly
from the aorta,

38:18.810 --> 38:21.278
the blood pressure
would have been intense.

38:21.312 --> 38:23.380
And our murderer would've
been drenched in blood.

38:23.414 --> 38:24.581
This is excellent work.

38:24.615 --> 38:26.516
BOTH: Thank you.
It makes up

38:26.551 --> 38:28.618
for whichever one of
you mistook this bone

38:28.653 --> 38:30.687
for a human medial cuneiform.

38:30.721 --> 38:32.322
Well, what is it?

38:32.356 --> 38:33.623
It must be bovine.

38:33.658 --> 38:34.624
That is incorrect.

38:34.659 --> 38:36.426
It's equine.

38:36.461 --> 38:38.462
As a senior intern
here, Ms. Wick.

38:38.496 --> 38:40.530
That makes this your mistake.

38:40.565 --> 38:41.765
Equine.

38:41.799 --> 38:43.800
That means it's from a horse?

38:43.835 --> 38:46.837
It wasn't Daisy.
I, uh, misidentified the bone.

38:46.871 --> 38:48.638
Are you covering for her?

38:48.673 --> 38:50.307
No. It's just, um,

38:50.341 --> 38:52.876
now that I look again
it's obviously

38:52.910 --> 38:54.778
the transected navicular
bone of a horse.

38:54.812 --> 38:56.913
Silly me.

38:56.948 --> 38:58.348
Please don't allow this
to happen in the future.

38:58.382 --> 38:59.749
It was my fault.

38:59.784 --> 39:01.184
He's taking blame
for something I did.

39:01.219 --> 39:02.652
I think we already established

39:02.687 --> 39:04.921
that's not in my nature.

39:04.956 --> 39:05.989
Can we move on, please?

39:06.023 --> 39:07.157
Yes.
Does this mean

39:07.191 --> 39:09.659
the stew was made out of horse?

39:09.694 --> 39:11.228
Horse and human.

39:11.262 --> 39:12.996
Don't be nice to me,
it's weird.

39:13.030 --> 39:15.165
You deal with it.
This could have gotten him killed.

39:15.199 --> 39:16.666
He knew someone was putting
horse meat in the stew

39:16.701 --> 39:19.169
and was threatening
to expose the company.

39:19.203 --> 39:22.806
I'll let Booth and Sweets
take care of the motive.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.342
All we do is provide them
with the science.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.413
She's not fun at all, is she?

39:30.448 --> 39:31.414
You've never seen Dr. Brennan

39:31.449 --> 39:32.749
dressed as a cowgirl

39:32.783 --> 39:34.084
drinking flaming sambucas

39:34.118 --> 39:35.652
fighting biker chicks.

39:35.686 --> 39:37.554
Okay, I want details, please.

39:37.588 --> 39:39.489
Come on, I was nice to you.

39:39.524 --> 39:41.324
Horse meat?
Which you fed to school children.

39:41.359 --> 39:43.994
What you did was
incredibly dangerous.

39:44.028 --> 39:45.896
This horse meat wasn't
properly inspected.

39:45.930 --> 39:47.264
It could've been laced

39:47.298 --> 39:49.466
with phenylbutazone,
which is toxic

39:49.500 --> 39:51.034
to bone marrow
and on rare occasions

39:51.068 --> 39:52.536
can cause aplastic anemia

39:52.570 --> 39:53.737
if consumed.

39:53.771 --> 39:55.405
Okay, so our quality control
was off.

39:55.439 --> 39:57.574
Nobody needs to die for that.

39:57.608 --> 39:58.642
Well, the FBI forensic
accountants

39:58.676 --> 40:00.110
are going through your records.

40:00.144 --> 40:01.444
But for now, look
what we got here.

40:01.479 --> 40:03.880
You authorized the
purchase of beef

40:03.915 --> 40:05.882
from this slaughterhouse
in Mexico.

40:05.917 --> 40:08.051
Beef.

40:08.085 --> 40:11.821
This slaughterhouse doesn't produce beef.
It only sells horse meat.

40:11.856 --> 40:12.923
That's definitely something
you would've known.

40:12.957 --> 40:14.558
Agent Booth here thinks

40:14.592 --> 40:16.092
that Howard Compton
found this out,

40:16.127 --> 40:17.994
and was going to tell
the authorities.

40:18.029 --> 40:19.896
So, you killed him and you
tossed him in the horse meat.

40:19.931 --> 40:23.233
I'm not going to confess
to killing Howard Compton.

40:23.267 --> 40:24.868
You have no proof.

40:24.902 --> 40:26.903
Oh, we don't want you
to confess, do we? - No.

40:26.938 --> 40:28.104
That would be too difficult.
Waste of time.

40:28.139 --> 40:29.072
It is a waste of time.

40:29.106 --> 40:30.240
So you know what we did?

40:30.274 --> 40:31.274
We just got a search warrant

40:31.309 --> 40:32.509
so we can look in your hair.

40:32.543 --> 40:34.277
Check my hair?
Mm-hmm.

40:34.312 --> 40:36.046
For what?

40:37.582 --> 40:38.648
Positive.

40:38.683 --> 40:39.883
You washed your hair

40:39.917 --> 40:41.618
a dozen times,
but it wasn't enough.

40:41.652 --> 40:43.553
All right, you under arrest,
let's go.

40:43.588 --> 40:44.888
Why are you handcuffing me?

40:44.922 --> 40:46.723
Why? Because you murdered
Howard Compton.

40:46.757 --> 40:48.658
That's why. Come on.

41:05.142 --> 41:06.109
I was just leaving.

41:06.143 --> 41:08.778
I know what you did.

41:08.813 --> 41:11.748
You told Brennan
to let me take her

41:11.782 --> 41:12.949
to that bachelorette party.

41:12.984 --> 41:14.117
You knew we were drifting apart,

41:14.151 --> 41:16.653
and you fixed it.
You know, Ange.

41:16.687 --> 41:19.656
I just want Bones to have what's
coming to her, that's all.

41:19.690 --> 41:21.458
Yeah, I get it.

41:21.492 --> 41:22.993
You wanted her to have

41:23.027 --> 41:24.628
her best friend back.

41:26.230 --> 41:29.466
So, what about us?

41:29.500 --> 41:31.601
Think we can be friends again?

41:34.205 --> 41:36.139
I said some things, I know.

41:36.173 --> 41:38.341
And I'm apologizing.

41:38.376 --> 41:39.743
Look, Angela.

41:39.777 --> 41:42.212
You know,
you-you put Bones first.

41:42.246 --> 41:45.115
Okay, I forgot about that
for a while.

41:46.117 --> 41:47.684
You think we could hug it out?

41:47.718 --> 41:48.718
Not necessary, really.

41:48.753 --> 41:49.853
Okay.

41:49.887 --> 41:50.954
We're okay.

41:50.988 --> 41:52.989
We're okay now, all right?

41:53.024 --> 41:54.991
Everything's fine.

41:55.026 --> 41:57.327
Aw, man, I miss this.
(chuckles)

41:57.361 --> 41:58.795
I mean, Brennan is really lucky
she's my friend

41:58.829 --> 42:00.397
or I would totally
make a move on you.

42:00.431 --> 42:03.033
Great, I really don't know
how to respond to that

42:03.067 --> 42:05.669
where I come out looking
like a good guy.

42:05.703 --> 42:08.338
You are a good guy.

42:08.372 --> 42:10.573
Thanks.

42:12.209 --> 42:14.678
You gave me my
best friend back.

42:14.712 --> 42:16.579
Everybody needs
a best friend.

42:16.614 --> 42:18.381
Well, who's your best friend?

42:18.416 --> 42:19.916
Uh, do you want me
to say you?

42:19.950 --> 42:21.084
No!

42:21.118 --> 42:22.686
Wow, why'd you say it
like that?

42:22.720 --> 42:25.322
Because the word "friend"
refers to a non-sexual,

42:25.356 --> 42:28.558
platonic relationship and
I do not want that with you.

42:28.592 --> 42:29.859
Me, either.

42:29.894 --> 42:31.194
You are not my best friend.

42:31.228 --> 42:32.329
Angela is my best friend.

42:32.363 --> 42:33.797
You are a whole
other dimension.

42:33.831 --> 42:35.565
A non-platonic dimension.

42:35.599 --> 42:36.700
Yes.

42:36.734 --> 42:37.801
If I ever became
your best friend,

42:37.835 --> 42:39.035
I would take that as a sign

42:39.070 --> 42:40.570
that we need to go
out into the world

42:40.604 --> 42:42.405
and find other...
I got it, I got it, I got it.

42:42.440 --> 42:43.840
I get it, I get it, okay?

42:43.874 --> 42:46.109
I'm never ever gonna
be your best friend.

42:46.143 --> 42:47.277
I hope not.
Okay, I won't.

42:47.311 --> 42:48.611
Well, you never said

42:48.646 --> 42:49.612
who your best friend is.

42:49.647 --> 42:50.647
I know.

42:50.681 --> 42:51.948
But not me.

42:51.982 --> 42:54.718
No, not you.

42:54.752 --> 42:57.053
You're a very romantic man.
Aw.

42:57.088 --> 42:58.388
No, I'm not your friend.

42:58.422 --> 42:59.556
I'm like your...
Not my friend.

42:59.590 --> 43:01.391
sexual puppy dog.
(laughs)

43:01.425 --> 43:02.959
More like a lion!

43:39.332 --> 43:41.766
What's that mean?

43:46.303 --> 43:47.670
Dinner!

43:47.705 --> 43:50.940
Ooh, I love
International Taco Night.

43:50.975 --> 43:52.275
VIRGINIA
We have...

43:52.309 --> 43:54.310
French fries, Greek yogurt,

43:54.345 --> 43:56.646
Canadian bacon,
Chinese noodles,

43:56.680 --> 43:58.047
Italian sausage,
American cheese,

43:58.082 --> 44:01.184
and from the country
of Chile, chili.

44:01.218 --> 44:02.519
Kind of just seems like
we're eating all the food

44:02.553 --> 44:03.686
in the fridge
that was about to go bad.

44:03.721 --> 44:05.288
Yes, but in a taco shell.

44:05.322 --> 44:07.724
This is like the buffet
at the United Nations

44:07.758 --> 44:09.225
without all the grab-ass.

44:09.260 --> 44:11.127
Hope, look,
these noodles

44:11.162 --> 44:12.729
were made all
the way in China

44:12.763 --> 44:14.531
by little girls
the same age as you.

44:14.565 --> 44:15.665
You know, in China

44:15.699 --> 44:16.966
they actually eat
a completely different

44:17.001 --> 44:18.234
kind of noodle
than we have here.

44:18.269 --> 44:19.502
I don't want to sound racist,

44:19.537 --> 44:21.471
but I kind of think
all Chinese noodles look alike.

44:21.505 --> 44:22.739
Yeah. I'm just saying.

44:22.773 --> 44:24.474
My family used to travel a lot
when I was a kid.

44:24.508 --> 44:25.668
China, Argentina,
Australia...
