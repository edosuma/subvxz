RICHIE:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">This is WZAZ-TV{\r}.</font></font></i>

01:28.540 --> 01:30.120
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

01:30.620 --> 01:32.130
and all the ships at sea.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.430
How was that?

01:33.630 --> 01:36.510
How many guys are trying out
for the announcer's job, Richie?

01:36.710 --> 01:39.300
About 15, but they're all
honor students.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.270
Do you think I'll get it?

01:40.630 --> 01:42.220
Do you know
what a fat chance is?

01:45.110 --> 01:47.560
Oh, save some roast beef
for your father, dear.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.110
He'll be home any minute.

01:49.530 --> 01:52.110
Oh, did he get hung up
at the Leopard Lodge again?

01:52.110 --> 01:53.610
Yes, he's working
very hard

01:53.610 --> 01:56.120
being chairman of the
Leopard's Demolition Derby.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.900
So be nice to your
father; he's tired.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.650
Oh, I will, but then can I go
over to Ginny Pickalow's house?

02:01.070 --> 02:02.160
Yes, yes, of course.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.160
Good.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.160
Hark, hark, the chairman of
the Demolition Derby is home.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.160
And have I got
something to show you.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.670
Yeah, congratulations,
Dad.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.670
I'll see you
later, all right?
Yeah, I'm happy too.

02:14.670 --> 02:15.670
Well, I'll be on my way.

02:15.670 --> 02:17.170
No, no, no, wait a minute.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.670
Come on, now,
everybody sit down.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.170
I got something very big
to share with you.

02:21.170 --> 02:24.180
Right here,
in this box,

02:24.180 --> 02:26.060
is one of the
highlights of my life.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.480
Oh, let me see.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.480
Is there a picture of you
with your tummy all tucked in?

02:32.940 --> 02:35.860
You're gonna do fat jokes in the
middle of a man's highlights?

02:36.190 --> 02:37.240
I'm sorry.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.740
It happens to be
the publicity leaflet

02:39.740 --> 02:41.740
for the Demolition Derby.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.250
"The Leopard's First Annual
Team Demolition Derby

02:44.250 --> 02:46.500
"will be held next Tuesday
at Pfister National Park.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.280
"It will feature great
demolition drivers

02:48.280 --> 02:50.750
"like Arthur Fonzarelli and
his partner Nookie Newman,

02:51.170 --> 02:52.540
and the..."
Dad, we know that.

02:52.790 --> 02:53.870
Would you be patient?

02:53.870 --> 02:55.180
Go on, Howard.

02:55.380 --> 02:56.960
Okay.
"Now, to kick off the derby,

02:56.960 --> 03:00.460
"the Leopards present a driving
exhibition by Pinky Tuscadero,

03:00.460 --> 03:03.470
the world's greatest female
cyclist, and her Pinkettes."

03:03.880 --> 03:04.970
Oh, she is marvelous.

03:04.970 --> 03:06.970
I just can't wait to see her
do those Poppa wheelies

03:06.970 --> 03:07.970
and those wild jumps.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.440
(imitates engine revving)

03:12.390 --> 03:13.480
Dad, Fonzie and Pinky
are old friends.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.440
HOWARD:
Yeah.

03:14.810 --> 03:15.900
"All proceeds..."
I think Fonzie's

03:15.900 --> 03:16.900
looking forward to seeing her.

03:16.900 --> 03:17.900
"All proceeds..."
Yeah.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.900
He got four of
his T-shirts pressed.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.900
Do you mind?

03:21.900 --> 03:22.900
Oh, go ahead, Dad.
Oh, go ahead.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.400
This is very
interesting, dear.
We're waiting.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.630
"All proceeds of the Demolition
Derby go to charity.

03:30.130 --> 03:33.130
"The entire event is sponsored
by the Milwaukee Leopard Lodge.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.970
Chairman of the event,
Leopard Howard Cunningham."

03:37.250 --> 03:37.830
Oh, that's great.

03:38.330 --> 03:39.340
Well, I'm going
to Ginny's.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.840
Yeah, thanks a lot, Dad.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.840
I'll read it later, okay?

03:41.840 --> 03:43.340
That's wonderful.

03:43.340 --> 03:44.840
JOANIE:
Oh, hope you get
the job, Richie.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.340
What later?

03:47.340 --> 03:49.350
I mean, the kids
on <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Father Knows Bes{\r}t</font></font></i>

03:49.350 --> 03:51.310
never walk out
on Robert Young.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.400
Hey, Fonz.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.490
Need some help, Fonz?

04:00.770 --> 04:01.860
Hey, listen, you guys,

04:01.860 --> 04:03.360
will you please
stick to the stand?

04:03.360 --> 04:05.660
It takes you an hour to
knock in one solitary nail.

04:05.860 --> 04:07.280
I hurt my thumb.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.580
Oh, yeah?

04:08.580 --> 04:09.950
You want me to
kiss that boo-boo?

04:11.250 --> 04:14.620
Good evening, gentlemen,
and all the ships at sea.

04:14.870 --> 04:15.960
All right,
Richie got the TV job!

04:15.960 --> 04:16.959
Yeah, I got it!
Okay!

04:16.959 --> 04:17.959
Yeah.
Great.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.430
All right, all right,
listen to this.

04:19.430 --> 04:21.459
Flash, this is
Rick Cunningham

04:21.459 --> 04:24.960
bringing you the Demolition
Derby live on WZAZ-TV.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.930
(chuckles)
Okay.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.680
Rick?

04:27.880 --> 04:29.850
You don't like Rick?

04:30.140 --> 04:32.110
Is your father's
name Ozzie?

04:32.390 --> 04:34.970
Yeah, right.

04:34.970 --> 04:35.980
Scratch Rick.

04:35.980 --> 04:37.860
Oh, oh, Fonz,
I got a message for you.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.780
Well, bring
it over here.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.780
Pinky was
over at the station,

04:42.280 --> 04:44.780
and she said she was going to be
by later with the Pinkettes.

04:44.780 --> 04:45.790
Oh, that's great.
Thanks a lot.

04:45.790 --> 04:47.790
Yeah-- oh, oh, right,
right, pictures.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.070
I got another
message for you.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.210
You're a regular little
courier pigeon, aren't you?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.580
No, no, see, they're,
they're letting me

04:54.580 --> 04:56.580
do this special feature
on all the derby drivers.

04:56.580 --> 04:57.580
I need a good
picture of you.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
Well, I got some
pictures inside.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.580
Well, now, it's got
to be a very good one.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.420
Hey, could this face
take a bad picture?

05:04.670 --> 05:06.760
Oh, no, I guess not.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.260
This is Richie Cunningham...

05:08.260 --> 05:09.760
You want to
get in here?

05:09.760 --> 05:11.180
Oh...
(motorcycles approaching)

05:11.510 --> 05:13.100
Hey, the Pinkettes
are here already.
Yeah, yeah.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.100
Let old Malph handle this.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.100
Okay. Do I look okay?
Yeah, perfect.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.600
Hiya, guys.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
Hi.
Hi, girls.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.100
Hi.
RALPH: You must be
the Pinkettes, huh?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.400
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.570
Is that Pinky's bike?

05:22.820 --> 05:24.690
Well, it's not Blackie's.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.580
Okay.
Go ahead.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.530
(clears throat)

05:27.910 --> 05:30.000
Hi, girls.
(chuckles)

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm a singer.

05:32.000 --> 05:32.780
You're boring.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.670
Oh, you've already
met Potsie.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.710
Hey, I love singers.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.170

the funniest guys

Ah, well, we certainly
are looking forward

to having you for dinner
tomorrow night, Miss Tuscadero.

it's a great honor

to have the guest star

10:01.800 --> 10:03.640
of the Demolition
Derby in our home.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.020
Well, Fonzie and I
would be happy to come,

10:06.020 --> 10:07.470
but you got
to call me Pinky.

10:07.860 --> 10:09.440
Oh, I can't wait
for Tuesday

when you do those
Poppa wheelies.

10:18.990 --> 10:19.990
(snaps)
Later.

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
You got some old lady.

10:23.490 --> 10:23.990
(snaps)
Later.

10:24.490 --> 10:24.990
Joanie!

10:25.410 --> 10:26.880
Later?

10:28.330 --> 10:29.580
RICHIE:
Al, come here
for a minute.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.880
Yeah.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.880
Come here. Listen.
Okay.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.880
It was really swell of you
to throw this party

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
kicking off the derby
and everything.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.250
Oh, it's nothing.

10:36.550 --> 10:38.140
I think you ought to make a
little welcoming speech, huh?

10:38.140 --> 10:39.640
No, I don't like to do that.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.140
Oh, the gang would love
to hear from you, Al.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.140
But I'm too shy.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.640
I'll-I'll introduce you.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.140
(chuckles):
No, don't, don't do that.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.150
Well, okay.

10:46.150 --> 10:49.150
Do it.

10:49.150 --> 10:50.650
And make it humble.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.150
Okay, right.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.650
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:54.650 --> 10:57.160
I'd like to hear a nice
round of applause for the man

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
who made this
evening possible.

10:58.660 --> 11:01.660
He supplied all the free
pizza and the free soda pop,

11:01.660 --> 11:03.660
so let's hear it for
a nice guy-- Al.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.670
(cheering, applause)

11:06.670 --> 11:08.170
Don't. Oh, no.

11:08.170 --> 11:10.170
Don't, don't,
don't do it.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.670
(chuckles)

11:11.670 --> 11:13.960
Well, everybody enjoy.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.260
Isn't Alfred cute?

11:16.260 --> 11:17.760
Arnold is cute.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.710
Alfred is humble.
And Italian.

11:27.970 --> 11:28.970
What's wrong, Fonz?

11:28.970 --> 11:29.970
(all chattering)

11:29.970 --> 11:31.470
All right, that's it.

11:31.470 --> 11:32.480
I'm not in
the derby anymore.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.860
Why? Why?
Why? What happened?

11:34.190 --> 11:36.280
Because my partner,
Nookie Newman,

11:36.280 --> 11:38.780
just broke his leg
jumping out of a motel window!

11:39.280 --> 11:40.280
Ah, no!
No!

11:40.280 --> 11:41.780
Terrible.
Well, Fonz,
you know,

11:41.780 --> 11:43.790
I'd drive, but
I'm hurt, too.
Yeah.

11:43.790 --> 11:44.790
(all groaning)
I am, I'm
hurt, look.

11:44.790 --> 11:45.790
All right,
all right, all right.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.290
Listen, I got
to think this out.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.120
Everybody just
get out of here.

11:48.410 --> 11:48.990
Come on, Shortcake, get out.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.000
Oh, Fonz, I'm sorry.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.330
Yeah, now I got to find
a substitute driver.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.130
I happen to know
the perfect person--

11:58.130 --> 11:59.890
Pinky Tuscadero.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.170
Hey, that's very nice.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.670
I'm low, you're
making a nice joke.

12:03.170 --> 12:04.010
That's very nice.

12:04.260 --> 12:05.810
What kind of joke?
This is my shot

12:05.810 --> 12:07.640
to be the first woman
in the derby.

12:07.890 --> 12:08.980
A woman in the derby?

12:08.980 --> 12:12.850
I got a problem, and you're
giving me silly suggestions.

12:15.770 --> 12:17.770
Ralph, you're driving with me.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.270
What?!
ALL:
Yay!

12:19.770 --> 12:21.270
No yay. No, no yay.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.280
Fonz, Fonz, I can't drive.
I'm hurt.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.780
Now, listen,
you're faking it.

12:24.780 --> 12:26.280
I'm going
to make you famous.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.280
Well, then, I'll hurt
myself, I promise.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.280
Somebody, hurt me!

12:29.280 --> 12:30.780
All right, all right,
look, I tell you,

12:31.280 --> 12:33.290
you're going to drive with me,
and that is it!

12:33.290 --> 12:35.290
Now stop babbling, make
some music for me, will you?

12:35.290 --> 12:36.290
All right.

12:36.290 --> 12:38.790
It's okay, Ralph.
It's okay.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.790
Dance.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.880
Hey, why don't you dance
with Ralph?

12:43.880 --> 12:44.760
He's your partner.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.130
Pinkettes, split!

12:47.470 --> 12:49.050
Ralph?

12:49.550 --> 12:51.050
Ralph is clumsy!

12:55.440 --> 12:58.030
You know, it's too bad
you two had to split up.

12:58.030 --> 12:59.530
Joanie.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.950
I hope you like
tapioca, Pinky.

13:01.310 --> 13:02.400
Oh, I love tapioca.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.700
I haven't seen that
since I was at the convent.

13:04.900 --> 13:05.480
The convent?

13:05.900 --> 13:06.820
Yeah.

13:09.160 --> 13:09.960
Were you a nun?

13:10.210 --> 13:11.620
Did they make you shave
your head?

13:11.870 --> 13:15.460
That's not
a polite question.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.410
Did they?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.830
I wasn't a nun.

13:19.830 --> 13:20.800
I just lived there.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.250
Well, how come you
lived in a convent?

13:23.250 --> 13:25.250
Now, this all might be
private, dear.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.140
I'd like to know,
too, Marion.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.510
It's not so private.

13:29.510 --> 13:32.510
You know, my mother and father
split up when I was a kid.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.010
You know, D-I-V-0-R-C-E.

13:34.430 --> 13:35.010
Divorce.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.770
Well, my mother
couldn't handle it,

13:38.770 --> 13:40.600
so she dropped me off
at the sisters'.

13:40.900 --> 13:41.990
Oh, that's too bad.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.940
Nah. Are you kidding?
I loved it.

13:43.940 --> 13:46.440
But 18 years old, either
you become a nun, or you leave.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.240
You know, split.
(whistles)

13:48.490 --> 13:52.030
It's just amazing how much
you and Fonzie have in common.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.280
Ah, forget it-- he wouldn't
even let me in the derby.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.120
But you <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">are
in the derby{\r}.</font></font></i>

13:56.120 --> 13:57.620
I mean, you're
the guest star.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.120
You're-You're
leading off the show

13:59.120 --> 14:00.460
with your
motorcycle tricks.

14:00.710 --> 14:02.090
Not as a driver.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.510
RICHIE:
Hi, folks. We're home.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.880
Oh, you're just in time
for dessert.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.770
Tapioca.

14:09.770 --> 14:11.770
We'll give you
some ice cream.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.770
Dad, uh...
Hmm?

14:14.770 --> 14:16.770
Will you come upstairs
with me for a minute?

14:16.770 --> 14:18.270
I haven't finished
my dessert yet.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.280
Well, you can finish it
upstairs, Dad.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
What are you doing?

14:21.780 --> 14:23.280
Well, we have
to talk.
Talk about what?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.280
I-I don't know.
The birds and the bees.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
Oh, Richard, we
already had that talk.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.290
Yeah, and you didn't
learn much.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.040
See, uh...

14:41.710 --> 14:45.130
There, uh, seems to be a little
tension between us here.

14:45.470 --> 14:47.970
Oh, you noticed?

14:48.300 --> 14:49.890
I had a long talk

14:49.890 --> 14:52.390
with Richie about
our misunderstanding.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.760
What did the
announcer say?

14:55.060 --> 14:58.650
Well, in between
his "huh-huh-huh's"

14:58.650 --> 15:00.650
he said that he thinks

15:00.650 --> 15:02.650
I should let you drive
in the derby, or you're going

15:02.650 --> 15:04.940
to get into a huff,
and you're going to walk out.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.490
You know,
redheads are just born geniuses.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.280
On the other hand,

15:09.740 --> 15:11.780
I don't think
you should be in the derby.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.280
I have spoken.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.280
That's that.

15:26.130 --> 15:29.710
You know, you got
the prettiest eyes.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.220
Come on now.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.220
I don't want any more
fighting here, all right?

15:38.220 --> 15:39.720
Come on.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.220
All right,
all right.
Hmm? Hmm?

15:41.220 --> 15:42.560
You got it, you got it.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.890
I still think
you're wrong, though.

15:44.890 --> 15:47.860
Why am I...
(shuddering)

15:53.240 --> 15:55.700
Is Ralph a better driver
than me?

15:55.960 --> 15:57.870
Ralph can't find reverse.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.740
You think when the action starts

16:00.740 --> 16:02.240
that I will panic
under pressure?

16:02.630 --> 16:04.960
Hey, Pinky, you know
I know that you're cool.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.670
Then give me one good reason
why I'm not your partner.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.000
The Lone Ranger.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.800
Was Tonto a girl?

16:11.050 --> 16:12.640
Oh, I don't know.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.510
He wore a feather.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.840
Hey, don't you joke

16:15.840 --> 16:18.340
about Tonto!

16:18.340 --> 16:19.350
I'm telling you something.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.760
There are always two guys--
that's right.

16:22.060 --> 16:25.150
Batman and Robin,
uh, the Green Hornet and Kato,

16:25.150 --> 16:28.020
Even Gene Autry had
a boy horse-- Champion!

16:29.910 --> 16:31.270
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans!

16:31.570 --> 16:33.660
Singers!
You're giving me singers!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.950
I'm talking about adventurers,
I'm talking about heroes,

16:37.160 --> 16:38.250
I'm talking about men

16:38.250 --> 16:40.120
that made this country
what it is today!

16:40.450 --> 16:42.030
Do you think that I, the Fonz,

16:42.030 --> 16:44.870
can break the tradition
by putting a woman in a derby?

16:45.090 --> 16:46.170
You know what I'm saying?

16:46.170 --> 16:47.670
Do you know
what I'm saying?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.680
No, I do not know
what you're saying!

16:49.680 --> 16:51.180
That's because pink
is fuzzing your brain!

16:51.680 --> 16:53.180
Yeah, I ought
to have it examined

16:53.180 --> 16:54.550
for hanging around
with you, boy!

16:54.880 --> 16:56.470
Ooh! Women!

17:03.970 --> 17:05.470
♪ I was moving
and a-groovin'-- whoo! ♪

17:05.970 --> 17:07.980
♪ We was a-reelin'

17:08.390 --> 17:10.480
♪ Hah! We was a-rollin'

17:13.950 --> 17:14.980

17:14.980 --> 17:16.990
(cheering and applause)

17:20.990 --> 17:22.290
Thanks, Pinky.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.630
Hey, next time let's
try a fast number, huh?

17:24.630 --> 17:26.630
Yeah.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.000
RALPH:
Richie?

17:29.300 --> 17:30.380
Rich!
Hi, Ralph.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.880
How's your neck?
Better.
Listen to me.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.390
I just saw the Mallachi
brothers outside.

17:33.390 --> 17:34.390
The Mallachi brothers?

17:34.390 --> 17:35.390
Hey, they're
great drivers.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.170
They're favored to win
the derby, you know.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.420
You don't seem to understand.

17:38.420 --> 17:39.730
I'm in big danger.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.390
I know, they're mean.

17:41.890 --> 17:43.400
Hey, we ought to get
an interview with them.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.400
The public loves violence.
Richie, you're not
listening to me.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.350
Those guys might hurt me.

17:46.770 --> 17:48.350
Oh, look at this.
This is wild.

17:48.350 --> 17:51.850
One time in Cicero, the
Mallachis destroyed 27 cars

17:51.850 --> 17:53.360
with the famous
Mallachi Crunch.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.780
Only half the cars were
actually in the derby.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.240
I know-- I know
all about it.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.080
They're outside wrecking cars
in the parking lot right now.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.780
Oh, it's Rocco Mallachi!

18:04.170 --> 18:06.750
It's Rocco
Mallachi!

18:06.750 --> 18:08.250
Hello, Roc.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.250
Hello.

18:09.670 --> 18:14.210
Well, will the owner of the car,
license plate number

18:14.210 --> 18:17.180
B-4-9-3-6 please
raise your hand?

18:19.050 --> 18:21.050
Your lights are on.

18:23.050 --> 18:24.550
That could have
been my face!

18:25.940 --> 18:27.520
Uh, Rocco? Rocco Mallachi?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.530
I'm Richie Cunningham
from WZAZ-TV, and, uh...

18:30.030 --> 18:32.530
and we'd like to do a
little interview with you.

18:32.530 --> 18:34.030
Oh, yeah, uh,
just wait a second.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.030
Wait for my brother to
come, Count Mallachi.

18:36.030 --> 18:38.030
Hey, Count Mallachi,
come on in here.

18:38.030 --> 18:39.030
Count Mallachi?

18:39.490 --> 18:41.040
Yeah, he likes to be
called Count Mallachi.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.370
He thinks he's the Gorgeous
George of demolition derbies.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.740
I have arrived.

18:47.740 --> 18:49.550
Let the pigeons loose!

18:49.750 --> 18:52.330
Sorry, Count,
we're out of pigeons.

18:52.330 --> 18:55.630
How about some turkey
or chicken salad?

18:55.800 --> 18:58.300
You think I'm funny,
pickle nose?

18:58.590 --> 19:01.010
No. Have a free slice
of pizza.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.260
Or better yet, take it all.

19:06.650 --> 19:07.730
Let me ask you something.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.230
Why does he talk like that?

19:09.230 --> 19:10.730
Not that there's anything
wrong with it.

19:10.730 --> 19:13.150
He hasn't been the same since
he saw <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">The Three Musketeers{\r}.</font></font></i>

19:13.520 --> 19:16.570
Oh, lo and behold.

19:16.570 --> 19:19.610
It is the fair Pinky
of the derriere.

19:19.610 --> 19:22.110
Attend to me, fair maiden,
and I will sing to thee

19:22.610 --> 19:24.610
from my book
of songs and sonnets.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Hey, why don't you go
sing into a bucket?

19:27.330 --> 19:28.420
(laughs)

19:28.420 --> 19:31.340
Clever, but very dangerous.

19:34.790 --> 19:35.790
MAN:
Hi, Fonz!

19:35.790 --> 19:37.180
WOMAN 2:
Here comes Fonzie!

19:37.540 --> 19:38.630
WOMAN:
Hi, Fonzie.

19:38.630 --> 19:40.960
Hey, Count, did
you say sonnets?

19:41.210 --> 19:42.800
Attend to me, maiden.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.300
Sit thee down
upon my fair knee.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.190
RICHIE:
All right,

19:48.470 --> 19:49.560
we're on the air.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.560
We're live at Arnold's,

19:50.560 --> 19:52.060
and we're expecting an interview

19:52.060 --> 19:54.060
with Arthur Fonzarelli
at any moment now.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.060
Here comes Fonzie.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.980
Fonz, I'd like...

19:59.150 --> 20:00.730
Bad time for an
interview, folks.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.740
Hey Fonz, Fonz,
I found a guy.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.740
He wants to drive
with you.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.710
Not now, Malph, not now.

20:10.910 --> 20:15.410
Ah, comrade, it has
been a long time, huh?

20:15.410 --> 20:17.420
Not long enough, Myron.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.170
He don't like you
to call him that.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.340
Well, let <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Myron tell me that
himself{\r}.</font></font></i>

20:21.670 --> 20:24.060
Ah, tush, an exception
for an old friend.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.090
Mm.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.930
Do I detect a note of
ill will in the air?

20:27.930 --> 20:29.930
Uh, someone in this room
does not think

20:30.430 --> 20:32.930
that I am good enough
to drive in the derby.

20:32.930 --> 20:36.690
Fiddle-ee-dee, thou
shall drive with me.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.490
If he keeps kissing your arm
like that,

20:38.990 --> 20:41.360
you're going to have
to get a shot for rabies.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.830
I'll ride with you, Count.

20:49.830 --> 20:50.830
'Tis settled then.

20:51.330 --> 20:52.280
Rocco, you're out.

20:52.700 --> 20:53.790
I-I'm your brother.

20:53.790 --> 20:55.290
I'll tell Mom.

20:55.290 --> 20:56.620
We're musketeers!

20:56.870 --> 20:58.960
You look more
like mouseketeers to me.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.930
With the little ears
and everything.

21:02.290 --> 21:03.880
Don't push it, Fonz.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.350
'Tis better to keep a
civil tongue in thy head.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.270
You know, Myron...
you're a clown.

21:20.450 --> 21:23.230
Rocco.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.030
Excuse me.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.580
(slow rock and roll
melody plays on jukebox)

21:33.580 --> 21:35.080
Dance, Count?

21:35.080 --> 21:37.410
I hear minstrels.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.510
It's the night
before the derby.

21:46.510 --> 21:48.840
Most of the combatants are
out on the dance floor.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.180
It's like the calm
before the storm.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.180
(music stops)

21:54.180 --> 21:55.680
This could be the storm.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
All right, listen up.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.520
There is an
announcement here.

22:00.740 --> 22:03.820
The itinerary
of drivers has been changed.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.110
Pinky, you drive with me.

22:06.330 --> 22:08.410
(crowd cheering and applauding)

22:09.860 --> 22:11.750
Oh, thank you, Lord, thank you.

22:14.580 --> 22:16.590
(music resumes)

22:21.670 --> 22:23.590
No more jokes about Tonto.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.760
Never.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.050
You have just witnessed
an historic moment.

22:32.470 --> 22:34.050
Pinky Tuscadero has been named

22:34.050 --> 22:36.560
to be the first woman driver
in the Demolition Derby.

22:37.060 --> 22:39.560
We'll talk to her now
and see how she feels.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.980
We'll interview that
history-making couple later.

23:03.470 --> 23:05.250
♪ A sweetheart ♪

23:05.470 --> 23:08.550
♪ Sends a letter ♪

23:08.970 --> 23:10.970
♪ Of good-bye... ♪

23:11.310 --> 23:12.890
It's getting late.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.680
What do you want
to do now?

23:14.890 --> 23:16.930
♪ It's no secret... ♪

23:20.350 --> 23:21.820
All right.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.100
Yeah, but first we've gotta give
Cunningham his interview, huh?

23:25.490 --> 23:27.070
(sighs)

23:27.070 --> 23:29.070
Oh great, all right,
okay.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.080
Let's go,
come on, guys.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.580
Come on, get the camera
in position, okay?

23:32.080 --> 23:33.080
All right.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.080
Come on.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.080
Get over here.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.080
Okay.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.090
All right.

23:40.090 --> 23:42.590
This is Richie Cunningham
in an exclusive interview

23:42.590 --> 23:45.090
with Arthur Fonzarelli
and Pinky Tuscadero,

23:45.590 --> 23:47.090
and I got it
for you, boy.

23:47.090 --> 23:49.540
I stayed up all night
for this thing.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.460
Uh, tell me, Fonzie,

23:51.460 --> 23:53.470
aren't you concerned about
the Mallachi brothers?

23:53.470 --> 23:54.470
They have a reputation

23:54.470 --> 23:56.270
for being unscrupulous
and devious.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.520
Hey, I don't know about that;
I just know they cheat.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.390
Well, uh, aren't
you worried

24:01.390 --> 24:03.390
that the Mallachi
brothers will try
and do something

24:03.390 --> 24:04.780
to keep you out
of the derby?

24:05.060 --> 24:07.650
Yeah, so I'm taking precautions.

24:08.150 --> 24:10.650
I got my car at your house
being guarded by your parents,

24:10.650 --> 24:13.650
and this lovely young lady's car
is at my garage,

24:13.650 --> 24:16.660
being guarded by two very
good personal friends.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.660
Hey, if Pinky
retires...

24:20.660 --> 24:22.160
Yeah?
I could
become the star

24:22.160 --> 24:23.660
and we'll get you
another Pinkette.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.160
Why you?
Well, red hair.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.670
Yeah, they're gonna
call you Reddy?

24:26.670 --> 24:28.670
Hi, girls!

24:28.670 --> 24:30.170
Look at this.
Whoa!
Call Fonzie!

24:30.170 --> 24:31.670
Yeah.
Oh, why call him?

24:31.670 --> 24:32.670
You'll see him
at the party.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.170
What party?
Are you sure?

24:34.170 --> 24:35.670
Oh, it's a--
it's a big party!

24:35.670 --> 24:37.560
It needs your sparkling
personalities.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.430
Oh!
Fonzie sent me
to get you.

24:39.930 --> 24:41.930
Yeah, yeah!
(giggling)

25:06.760 --> 25:08.760
Look, Alfred, just send
Fonzie over here

25:08.760 --> 25:10.040
as soon as you
see him,

25:10.290 --> 25:11.380
all right?

25:11.380 --> 25:13.380
Yeah, well-well somebody wrecked
Pinky's car--

25:13.380 --> 25:15.380
smashed up the whole engine.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.380
I think it was the Mallachis.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.380
RICHIE:
They painted a
big red "M"

25:18.380 --> 25:20.220
on the side
of the car.

25:20.470 --> 25:22.550
No, no, don't tell Fonzie that.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.560
No, just-just send him
over here.

25:24.970 --> 25:26.060
Okay.

25:26.060 --> 25:28.060
We've gotta keep
Fonzie calm.
Calm?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.530
He's gonna come in here
and go berserk!

25:29.860 --> 25:30.950
Gotta use
psychology.

25:30.950 --> 25:32.950
Very tricky
psychology.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.950
(tires squealing,
engine rumbling)

25:34.950 --> 25:35.950
Oh no,
that's Fonzie!

25:35.950 --> 25:37.450
Okay, now
what do we do, Rich?

25:37.450 --> 25:39.290
We shove all this stuff
under the hood!

25:40.620 --> 25:42.120
That's psychology?

25:42.620 --> 25:45.130
You let me do all
the talking with Fonzie.

25:45.630 --> 25:48.080
I've handled him all the other
times he's been upset.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.630
All right, you do
all the talking.

25:49.630 --> 25:50.630
All right, yeah,
put that down,

25:50.630 --> 25:52.130
put the hood down Ralph,
come on,

25:52.130 --> 25:53.130
and just act natural,
all right?

25:53.640 --> 25:54.640
Just act nat...

25:54.640 --> 25:56.640
Holding a fan is
not acting natural!

25:56.640 --> 25:57.590
Oh, my gosh!

26:00.060 --> 26:01.560
Lads, lads, lads.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.060
Oh, hi, Fonz.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.560
How are you?

26:04.560 --> 26:06.570
Great day for the derby,
huh, Fonz?

26:06.570 --> 26:08.570
Fonzie's here,
Ralph.

26:08.570 --> 26:10.570
Hi, Fonz.
You're here.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.850
Beautiful day,
huh, Fonz?

26:13.020 --> 26:14.610
Yeah, it's a beautiful day

26:15.110 --> 26:18.030
for anything
and <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">everything, eh{\r}?</font></font></i>

26:18.360 --> 26:19.910
Anything.
Right, everything.
Anything.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.750
Listen, now, I'm gonna get
in that car, right?

26:22.030 --> 26:23.620
So get out of the way, I want
to warm up the engine.

26:23.620 --> 26:24.370
RICHIE:
There's something I gotta
tell you, Fonz.

26:24.620 --> 26:26.200
Uh...

26:26.700 --> 26:29.170
Fonze, uh, something
unexpected has happened, see?

26:29.170 --> 26:31.210
And it's important that
you keep an open mind.

26:31.710 --> 26:33.210
Do you believe
in destiny?

26:33.710 --> 26:36.210
Is this gonna
be a religious talk?

26:36.210 --> 26:37.210
It's not a
religious talk.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.210
Hey, hey, hey, this
is not funny here.

26:39.210 --> 26:40.100
This car don't start.

26:40.380 --> 26:41.470
Well, just remember:

26:41.970 --> 26:43.270
"To forgive is divine."

26:43.470 --> 26:44.550
Sorry, Pinky.
We're sorry.

26:44.550 --> 26:46.050
We're sorry.
We're sorry.

26:46.050 --> 26:48.060
My two aces are blowing it.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.560
They're going to a party
with Rocco

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
instead of guarding my car.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.560
What's wrong with
this, Pink?

26:52.560 --> 26:53.560
It doesn't start.
Hey, Fonze, don't...

26:53.560 --> 26:55.560
don't look under
that hood, okay?
No. No.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.480
Get off that hood!

26:56.870 --> 26:57.950
Don't look
under there.

26:57.950 --> 26:58.950
No! No!

26:58.950 --> 27:02.040
(all shouting at once)

27:03.370 --> 27:04.870
Hey!

27:07.960 --> 27:10.550
All right, now we all
saw what just happened...

27:11.050 --> 27:13.550
and, uh, I know exactly
what to do.

27:16.050 --> 27:17.590
All right, Malph,
get over here.

27:18.090 --> 27:19.090
I want you and Potsie

27:19.090 --> 27:20.510
to get me a gallon
of pink paint.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.420
RALPH: Right, Fonz.
POTSIE:
Right, Fonz.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.430
All right, Tina, Lola,
get over here.

27:24.430 --> 27:25.930
All right now, listen--

27:25.930 --> 27:27.430
I want you to go
to Pfister's Emporium,

27:27.430 --> 27:29.430
I want you to get me a tire,
standard size;

27:29.430 --> 27:31.430
I want you to get me points
and plugs, dig it?

27:31.430 --> 27:32.770
Oh, we're sorry,
Fonz, really.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.100
Are you mad at us?

27:34.100 --> 27:35.100
Well, what you did
was wrong,

27:35.100 --> 27:36.910
but like they say,
to forgive is what?

27:37.110 --> 27:38.690
Divine.
Divine!

27:38.690 --> 27:40.190
Thank you.

27:40.190 --> 27:41.190
All right, Richie,
get over here.
Right.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.690
I want you
to tell your father

27:42.690 --> 27:45.500
to stall the beginning of the
derby for as long as he can.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.200
Yeah, well, I'm gonna get him
to disqualify the Mallachis.

27:47.530 --> 27:49.120
No, don't disqualify 'em.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.120
I'm gonna take care
of 'em in the derby.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.590
Fonz, I don't know if
I can leave you at
a time like this.

27:53.590 --> 27:55.590
Like what?
Well, you're obviously
very upset.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.540
They wrecked the car--
I'm afraid you're
gonna go out there,

27:57.880 --> 27:58.960
try and get revenge...
Richie!

27:58.960 --> 28:01.260
I'm gonna be just fine,
will you get out of here?

28:01.460 --> 28:03.050
Fonz, I am proud of you.

28:03.550 --> 28:05.050
It is amazing how
calm you are

28:05.050 --> 28:06.520
under these
circumstances.
Hey, Richie...

28:06.850 --> 28:09.440
Richie, I asked your father
to stall, not you.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.940
Oh, you want
me to go?
Yeah.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.440
I'm going, Fonz.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.450
You think you can fix this
in time for the derby?

28:17.950 --> 28:19.450
I'll fix it.

28:19.950 --> 28:21.450
Pretty Eyes,
you're amazing.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.450
No man alive

28:22.950 --> 28:23.950
could have handled
a disaster like this.

28:23.950 --> 28:24.950
You know something?

28:25.370 --> 28:26.400
You are the coolest.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.370
Yeah.
The coolest.

28:28.370 --> 28:31.160
Yeah, I know, man, I...

28:31.410 --> 28:32.490
I am cool.

28:32.490 --> 28:35.130
But I'm losing it!

28:35.410 --> 28:37.000
Wait!

28:46.010 --> 28:48.010
I got it back.

28:50.850 --> 28:51.850
HOWARD:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Stall{\r}?</font></font></i>

28:51.850 --> 28:52.760
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">That's impossible{\r}.</font></font></i>

28:53.060 --> 28:54.650
Absolutely
impossible, Richard.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.650
Do you know what
you're asking of me?

28:56.650 --> 28:58.150
Dad, you have
to stall.

28:58.150 --> 29:00.660
Look, do you want to have
a derby with no Fonzie?

29:00.660 --> 29:03.160
You're asking me,
an unarmed man,

29:03.160 --> 29:05.660
to get up in front of that
Demolition Derby crowd,

29:05.660 --> 29:08.160
people who have probably
eaten raw meat for breakfast,

29:08.160 --> 29:10.670
and say "Sorry, we have
to delay the derby."

29:10.670 --> 29:12.000
Is that the way
you picture it?

29:12.280 --> 29:13.870
Well, I thought
you'd start off

29:13.870 --> 29:14.790
by telling a few jokes.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.760
Oh, that's a good idea.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.760
Yeah, jokes are good.
Yeah.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.760
How about this one?

29:20.760 --> 29:24.710
How did the moron get involved
with the Demolition Derby?

29:25.210 --> 29:26.630
I don't know, Dad. How?

29:27.020 --> 29:28.880
His son talked him into it.

29:30.190 --> 29:32.140
I never heard that one.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.060
Richard, this is
all your fault.

29:37.060 --> 29:39.060
The Leopards should have had
a picnic, just like always.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.030
Now, that's fun stuff!

29:41.030 --> 29:43.450
We had softball games
and sack races.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.280
You remember the time
your mother sat

29:45.280 --> 29:46.790
in the potato salad, huh?

29:46.790 --> 29:48.150
That's fun stuff!

29:48.490 --> 29:50.570
Dad, those are
bygone days.

29:51.070 --> 29:52.570
Now, come on, are you
gonna stall or not?

29:52.990 --> 29:55.080
Well, okay, I guess
I've got no choice.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.580
Oh, great.
I'll try to stall.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.580
I just hope my insurance
is paid up.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.580
Well, we'll all
help you stall.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.050
I'll lengthen
my starter speech.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.000
Marion, all you're
gonna say is,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.010
"Gentlemen,
start your engines."

30:08.010 --> 30:09.310
I'll stutter.

30:11.890 --> 30:13.340
Why are you bringing
a hair dryer?

30:13.600 --> 30:14.680
Fonzie asked for it.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.510
He said he'd need it
against the Mallachis.

30:16.730 --> 30:18.320
Well, I knew they
were mean,

30:18.320 --> 30:20.600
but I didn't think they'd
mess up people's hair.

30:22.900 --> 30:24.410
I'm gonna have to get over
to the field.

30:24.410 --> 30:25.410
But, Dad, listen,

30:25.410 --> 30:27.190
I think you should
tell a few jokes.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.440
Uh, especially that one

30:28.440 --> 30:29.940
about the nearsighted
ostrich with the hat.

30:29.940 --> 30:32.450
That one always
knocks 'em dead.

30:32.450 --> 30:34.450
Richard...
Yeah?

30:34.450 --> 30:35.950
Go to the field...
Uh-huh?

30:35.950 --> 30:37.950
and sit on it.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.430
What, the nearsighted
ostrich with the hat?

30:46.430 --> 30:47.300
I don't know that one.

30:47.550 --> 30:49.930
You never will, dear,
it's a smut joke.

30:50.130 --> 30:52.720
Mom, I'll tell you
in the car.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.720
You'll love it!
You'll love it!

30:57.220 --> 31:00.530

31:36.090 --> 31:37.480

31:37.730 --> 31:39.310
Hey, hey, who's gonna
have some pizza?

31:39.310 --> 31:40.820
Come on folks,
be happy, be happy.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.320
The Pinkettes
have performed

31:42.320 --> 31:43.820
for 20 minutes longer
than they were supposed to,

31:43.820 --> 31:44.820
now what am I gonna do?

31:46.650 --> 31:48.240
You're gonna have to
think of something.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.240
You're the chairman.
All right, all right.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.240
I'll-I'll think
of something.

31:51.740 --> 31:52.740
I know what I'm
gonna do.

31:52.740 --> 31:54.080
Uh-uh, folks?

31:54.330 --> 31:56.410
We're gonna be ready to start
in-in just a few minutes.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.780
But first, uh,

31:58.080 --> 32:00.670
did you hear the one about
the nearsighted ostrich?

32:01.170 --> 32:02.670
Oh, Howard,
not that one.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.010
I'm desperate, Marion.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.870
Hey, sweetie,

32:05.870 --> 32:07.380
did you know
I'm a backup driver?

32:07.380 --> 32:10.380
I could be in the derby
any minute.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.300
So, I'll be your backup
boyfriend.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.180
Howard, you're gonna
be in big trouble

32:15.180 --> 32:16.680
if you don't stop drinking
all that soda.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.190
You get nervous
and excited,

32:18.190 --> 32:20.190
and you have to go to the
bathroom all the time.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.690
We're all gonna be
in big trouble, Marion,

32:21.690 --> 32:23.690
if Fonzie doesn't
show up pretty soon.

32:23.690 --> 32:26.140
Why do you say that?

32:26.480 --> 32:27.560
HOWARD:
That's why, Marion.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.360
ROCCO:
Hey, let's get started.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.700
Hey you, with the tiger
on your head.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.200
It's a leopard
on my head.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.950
A tiger, no problem.
Same jungle.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.160
I just know that Fonzie's
gonna show up.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.490
Give him five more minutes,
and then I'll... I'll
wave the flag.

32:39.490 --> 32:40.330
COUNT:
Press on, huh?

32:40.540 --> 32:42.460
Yeah, let's go, huh?

32:42.660 --> 32:43.750
HOWARD:
I'll be right
back, Marion.

32:44.160 --> 32:48.550
In the meantime,
you pray thee for me.

32:48.750 --> 32:52.300
RICHIE:
Over here is the spot
where Pinky would be

32:52.300 --> 32:53.840
if Pinky was here.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.840
And on this side of the ring,

32:55.840 --> 32:58.760
the spot where Fonzie
will be if he shows up.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.510
And on this side of the ring,
we have...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.260
(drumroll)
Boo Boo Fox...

33:03.260 --> 33:05.020
and next to him,
his partner,

33:05.520 --> 33:08.020
a local favorite,
Mad Man Mahocky.

33:08.020 --> 33:08.820
On the other side

33:09.020 --> 33:10.100
of the ring we have
Filthy Marvin

33:10.100 --> 33:12.020
and his partner,
No Nose Quirk.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.360
Good luck,
No Nose.

33:14.610 --> 33:15.690
(chuckles)

33:16.190 --> 33:17.700
No Nose, Boo Boo...

33:17.700 --> 33:19.700
makes me think
I got a dull name.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.120
But, th-that's a story
in itself.

33:22.450 --> 33:24.040
Hi, girls.

33:24.540 --> 33:26.040
I'm Ralph "the Flash" Malph.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.040
I'm a driver here
at the derby.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.510
I guess you're
pretty impressed.

33:31.930 --> 33:33.380
They don't understand drivers.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.630
And next, we have the diabolical
Count Mallachi,

33:36.850 --> 33:38.800
and his brother Rocco.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.470
(booing)

33:40.770 --> 33:42.350
Let the pigeons loose!

33:42.770 --> 33:44.140
We have no pigeons.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.860
RICHIE:
That's the end
of the introductions.

33:47.190 --> 33:49.280
While we're waiting for some
of the activities to begin,

33:49.780 --> 33:52.280
let's go over the rules
of team Demolition Derby.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.280
Each team is made up
of two cars

33:55.280 --> 33:57.290
and their,
and their drivers...

33:57.290 --> 33:59.790
uh, driving in
a marked, circled area.

33:59.790 --> 34:02.790
The object of the contest is
to slam into the others' cars

34:02.790 --> 34:04.790
until they're out of operation.

34:04.790 --> 34:07.300
The winner is the last car
that can still move.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.300
All drivers must wear
seat belts and helmets...

34:10.300 --> 34:11.250
(engine roaring,
tires squealing)

34:11.670 --> 34:13.500
(cheering)

34:13.719 --> 34:14.719
He's here! Fonzie's here!

34:15.050 --> 34:17.639
Yes, it's car number seven,
Pinky Tuscadero,

34:18.139 --> 34:20.639
and Arthur Fonzarelli
in car number six.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.639
He showed up, ladies and
gentlemen, just as I expected.

34:23.639 --> 34:26.100
Fonzie did it.
He fixed Pinky's car.

34:26.510 --> 34:27.600
Woo-hoo!

34:27.600 --> 34:29.100
Pinky, it goes
with your hair.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.440
Oh, it's just
beautiful!

34:41.750 --> 34:43.699
Hey, thanks for busting up
Pinky's car.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.080
Sir Fonzo
of the Milwaukee,

34:46.580 --> 34:49.090
and his lovely maiden
Pinky of the derriere.

34:49.090 --> 34:50.920
What's a derriere?
Trust me.

34:51.170 --> 34:52.670
Let's get on with this here.

34:52.960 --> 34:53.460
Adieu.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.880
Now, look, Marion,
are you sure

34:59.880 --> 35:01.380
you know what
you're gonna say?

35:01.380 --> 35:02.880
Course I do: Gentlemen,
start your engines.

35:02.880 --> 35:03.770
That's perfect.

35:04.050 --> 35:06.600
(applause, cheering)

35:10.020 --> 35:11.440
Hey, Myron, we're ready to go.

35:11.730 --> 35:13.310
Never let "Myron" pass thy lips,

35:13.310 --> 35:15.150
least my fist
shall smash thy face.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.730
Right-- Count. Count.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.540
Pinky, where is your helmet?

35:23.790 --> 35:25.320
I don't like a helmet.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.710
It's not me-- you know that.

35:26.910 --> 35:27.490
Let's go.

35:27.990 --> 35:29.490
Oh, that chick has got to learn.

35:29.490 --> 35:30.800
You got to learn.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.660
Now we'd like to take you
to the grandstand,

35:32.660 --> 35:34.670
where Howard Cunningham,
the chairman

35:34.670 --> 35:36.670
of the Leopard Lodge
Demolition Derby,

35:36.670 --> 35:38.670
is waiting to start
the big event.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.000
Howard?

35:40.220 --> 35:41.810
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:41.810 --> 35:43.810
here is your
lovely starter,

35:43.810 --> 35:45.180
Marion Cunningham.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.010
(cheering, whooping)

35:47.400 --> 35:49.480
(laughing nervously)

35:49.480 --> 35:50.980
Uh...

35:50.980 --> 35:54.490
Gentlemen,
start your junk!

35:55.770 --> 35:57.160
(echoing):
Oh, Howard...

35:57.360 --> 35:59.740
(engines starting)

36:00.020 --> 36:01.110
Count. I said Count.

36:01.580 --> 36:02.440
He can't remember Count?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.920
And now we're ready
for the derby to begin.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
We'll be right back
after this message.

36:16.290 --> 36:17.380
Oh, Howard, I'm sorry.

36:17.380 --> 36:18.880
Start your junk...
Marion...

36:18.880 --> 36:19.880
Well, you--
forget it.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.380
Just-just-just
wave the flag, huh?
Okay.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.760
Wave, wave...
No, no, Marion...

36:24.100 --> 36:26.100
Drop it!
I'm sorry.

36:26.470 --> 36:27.970
Let loose the pigeons.

36:28.350 --> 36:31.940
RICHIE:
With the drop of the flag,
the derby begins.

36:31.940 --> 36:32.940
(crashing, metal screeching)

36:33.360 --> 36:34.860
All right, Pinky,
that a girl, go get them!

36:35.190 --> 36:36.060
(whooping)

36:36.280 --> 36:37.780
(tires screeching)

36:39.980 --> 36:41.820
Not bad, not bad.

36:42.150 --> 36:43.650
Hey, Mom should see us now, huh?

36:43.990 --> 36:45.990
RICHIE:

RICHIE:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Pinky intercepts the hit{\r}.</font></font></i>

36:50.490 --> 36:52.080
PINKY:
I took the hit
for you, Fonz.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.330
Why'd you do that, Pinky?

36:53.540 --> 36:54.910
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.050
That a girl, Pinky,
that's why I love you!

36:57.220 --> 36:58.300
You sure they
won't be hurt?

36:58.800 --> 36:59.800
Marion, they're
wearing helmets,

36:59.800 --> 37:01.300
and they got seat belts,

37:01.300 --> 37:02.800
and they wear
padded suits.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.310
As long as they stay
in the cars,

37:04.310 --> 37:05.560
they won't get hurt.

37:05.810 --> 37:07.760
Oh, boy, I'll tell you,
I'm in my element now.

37:08.180 --> 37:09.180
(crashing)

37:10.810 --> 37:12.850
I'm gonna get that guy,
the Fonz.

37:14.430 --> 37:15.430

37:15.770 --> 37:16.820
Oh, that was a bad one.

37:17.150 --> 37:20.190
How am I doing in my rear?
Tell me, how am I doing?

37:20.570 --> 37:21.660
Watch out!

37:21.660 --> 37:23.160
Wahoo!

37:23.160 --> 37:24.580
This is Pinky's day, honey.
