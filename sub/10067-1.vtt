01:34.794 --> 01:35.852
- I got you.
- No, no, no, no.

01:35.895 --> 01:37.089
I got you.
I got you.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.360
Okay, it's okay.
Okay.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.388
Oh, god.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.128
It's... it's okay.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.329
- Oh, god.
- Come on.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.860
Oh, god.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.377
There you go.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.682
They're all dead.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.155
He killed them all.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.920
I can't figure you people out.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.761
Honey Island Swamp has been closed
for decades and for good reason.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.290
But every now and then, some stupid
son-of-a-bitch thinks he knows better.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.132
I knew.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.936
Let me guess,
you don't believe in ghosts.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.943
You think Victor Crowley
is a legend.

02:23.977 --> 02:28.607
I went in there to find my family, my...

02:30.717 --> 02:33.049
My brother and my father.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.846
He killed them all.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.654
What the hell were they doing in there?

02:39.692 --> 02:41.683
Night fishing.

02:41.728 --> 02:46.188
My daddy was a gator hunter.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.326
He and my brother started
pulling in twice their load

02:49.369 --> 02:53.237
once they start to hunt
away from everybody else.

02:53.273 --> 02:56.868
We needed the money
after my momma passed away.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.779
Oh, god.

03:01.814 --> 03:02.610
Now I'm all alone.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.947
Your daddy should have known better.

03:04.984 --> 03:08.681
Hell, every hunter from around here
knows not to go in that damn swamp.

03:08.721 --> 03:12.316
I was telling 'em, I say,
"Stay the hell out!"

03:12.358 --> 03:14.258
Well, they all call me crazy.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.785
They think I'm sick in the head.

03:16.829 --> 03:20.128
Here, you drink this.
It's nice and warm.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.597
First things first.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.934
We gotta find out wherever it is
you're living and get you there.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.099
We're gonna get you a doctor.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.075
I think I should go to the police.

03:30.109 --> 03:31.076
The police?

03:31.110 --> 03:33.271
What, and fill out
one of the missing reports,

03:33.313 --> 03:36.111
like the hundreds of others
filled out in this area?

03:36.149 --> 03:37.707
You'll never hear back from them.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.150
But I know where their bodies are.

03:40.186 --> 03:41.244
Yeah, right.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.755
Those big city cops are
hightailing down here

03:43.790 --> 03:47.419
and-and-and they'll find all that
evidence before the wildlife eats it.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.758
What am I supposed to do?

03:49.796 --> 03:52.526
Never come back this way again.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.533
Hell, you're a lucky girl.

03:54.567 --> 03:59.027
You got out of there alive
and with all your pieces!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.131
Look, miss,
what... what's your name?

04:01.174 --> 04:03.574
Marybeth.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.305
Marybeth Dunston.

04:08.348 --> 04:12.284
Holy Christ, your Samson's kid.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.808
Yes.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.688
Get out!

04:18.458 --> 04:20.289
- What?
- Get out of my house right now!

04:20.326 --> 04:22.055
Get out, now!

04:22.095 --> 04:23.426
You knew my daddy?

04:23.463 --> 04:24.725
No.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.755
But I know what your daddy did

04:26.799 --> 04:29.859
and I want nothing to do with it.

04:29.902 --> 04:33.394
I keep myself to myself,
and that ghost leaves me be.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.236
But I can't have
nothing to do with you.

04:35.275 --> 04:35.934
Get out!

04:35.975 --> 04:38.603
But how am I supposed to get home?

04:38.645 --> 04:41.614
Out that door is Lodge Road.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.275
You take it a half a mile down,

04:43.316 --> 04:46.046
you're gonna find a gas station,
you get a ride from there,

04:46.085 --> 04:48.519
but I can't have nothing to do with you.
Get out!

04:48.554 --> 04:51.387
I... but l... I don't understand.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.319
You get out of my house,
Marybeth Dunston.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.093
What's going on?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.931
You want answers,
you go see Reverend Zombie.

05:04.370 --> 05:08.329
Now, miss,
you get far, far away from here

05:08.374 --> 05:11.366
or I swear to God
I will shoot you dead.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.796
I didn't do nothing wrong.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.102
I didn't know who she was.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.131
It don't count.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.508
All right, let's take a look
at tonight's haul.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.137
What do we got here?

05:59.659 --> 06:01.490
Oh, that's nice.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.084
Yeah.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.865
Yeah.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.029
That's it.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.137
Play.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.075
Man
Let's see something.
It's show time, huh?

06:18.111 --> 06:20.545
- Whoo!

06:20.580 --> 06:23.413
- There you go.
- Wait. Is this gonna be on
Bayou Beavers?

06:23.449 --> 06:24.677
Score.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.775
MAN
Let's see what you can do.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.514
Good, 'cause
I want my daddy to see this.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.748
Whoo!

06:29.789 --> 06:31.051
Fuck you, Dad!

06:31.090 --> 06:32.580
I hope that you're watching this...

06:32.625 --> 06:33.114
Oh, yeah.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.524
...because you love Danielle
more than me

06:34.560 --> 06:36.425
and I hope that Bill at the office--

06:40.233 --> 06:41.860
MAN
Roll back, relax a little bit

06:41.901 --> 06:45.166
maybe show us the other side
of Cindy--there we go.

06:45.204 --> 06:47.069
Oh, you look fantastic.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.040
Really nice.
Really nice.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.633
Don't I know you from somewhere?

06:50.676 --> 06:52.234
MAN
No, you don't know me.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.906
- Maybe put your hair up in a--
- No, no! I know you.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.007
You're-you're my History teacher
from fifth grade.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.278
- Oh, no.
- Mr. Barrett.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.047
- I'm Mr. Shapiro
- Yeah--

07:03.956 --> 07:05.218
MAN
Hey, where are you going?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.850
Mister, leave me alone.

07:06.893 --> 07:07.985
MAN Come on.
Why don't you to lift up that shirt.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.257
Let's see what you got
going on under there.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.854
Dude, I'm 14.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.593
Oh, that ain't right.

07:17.069 --> 07:17.535
MAN
Good, good.

07:17.570 --> 07:21.734
Okay, when I say action,
you girls drop the towels and, uh,

07:21.774 --> 07:23.071
start washing each other.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.599
Yeah, no.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.737
MAN
Okay, girls. Drop the towels.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.837
Drop the towels.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.075
Touch Walking Hepatitis over here?

07:30.116 --> 07:30.707
I'll pass.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.218
Well, at least I'm not a hermaphrodite.

07:33.252 --> 07:36.153
Hermaphrodite,
big word of the day for you.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.555
What is a hermaphrodite, darling?

07:38.591 --> 07:40.821
Why would I tell you
if I just said it?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.157
Of course, I knew what it is.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.095
- You probably don't know what it is.
- Well, why don't you go ahead and explain it?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.825
Why would I need to explain it?

07:45.865 --> 07:47.389
You probably don't even know what it is.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.298
Why don't we do it
on the count of three together?

07:49.335 --> 07:50.893
- Fine.
- Okay?

07:50.937 --> 07:53.167
One, two, three.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.107
A person who has a
penis and a vagina.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.234
Ew.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.462
I didn't do nothin'!

08:19.398 --> 08:21.457
I didn't even know
who that girl was!

09:27.900 --> 09:29.492
♪♪

12:16.569 --> 12:18.434
What do you want?

12:18.471 --> 12:19.995
Hi.

12:20.039 --> 12:24.066
Um, I need to talk to you
about something?

12:24.110 --> 12:25.873
Come back some other time.

12:25.911 --> 12:26.775
I'm busy

12:26.812 --> 12:28.643
When?

12:28.681 --> 12:29.807
Next month.

12:29.849 --> 12:30.907
No.

12:30.950 --> 12:34.181
I need to talk to you.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.847
Now.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.355
All right, all right.
Come in. Come in.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.059
This better be important.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.263
I'm a busy guy.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.635
Jack Cracker sent me.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.003
What?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.439
We're so scared,
it was terrifying.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.375
I'm never going skiing again.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.640
That old whack job?

13:00.679 --> 13:02.510
So what do you need from me?

13:05.151 --> 13:06.675
Everybody's dead.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.949
Last night in Honey Island Swamp--

13:11.991 --> 13:13.856
Honey Island Swamp.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.523
Were you on that tour?

13:18.564 --> 13:19.826
Yeah.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.833
And how did you know?

13:21.867 --> 13:24.893
What happened?

13:24.937 --> 13:27.565
The boat driver was an idiot.

13:27.606 --> 13:31.872
He got us stuck,
and Crowley massacred everybody.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.037
But I got away.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.979
Shaun, the boat driver,
is he dead?

13:36.015 --> 13:36.845
You knew him?

13:36.882 --> 13:38.440
Shoo!

13:40.920 --> 13:43.912
He worked for me.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.254
That was one of my boats.

13:47.359 --> 13:48.621
I don't understand.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.162
Shut up.

13:57.636 --> 14:01.094
No one's been able to run tours
out of this swamp for years,

14:01.140 --> 14:02.801
not since I've had this shop.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.706
Ever.

14:03.742 --> 14:06.336
Not me, not anybody.

14:06.378 --> 14:12.146
So I was forced to run tours at the
back door of one of my other shops.

14:12.184 --> 14:15.312
Times are tough
and money is money.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.050
You sound just like my daddy.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.523
Who's your father?

14:19.558 --> 14:20.820
Samson Dunston.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.856
Samson Dunston.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.558
Samson Dunston's kid?

14:26.599 --> 14:27.258
Yes.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.767
Well, how is old Samson doing?

14:29.802 --> 14:31.770
He's dead.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.170
Grace.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.798
Crowley got him

14:35.841 --> 14:37.035
and my brother too,

14:37.076 --> 14:39.237
and then Jack Cracker
freaked out on me.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.576
Practically shot me when
he found out who I was.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.640
He said that you would be able
to tell me what my daddy did.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.049
Samson Dunston.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.112
- Samson Dunston's gone.
- Please.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.623
What do you know?

14:52.658 --> 14:54.956
Same thing that
everybody else whispers

14:54.994 --> 14:57.428
about these backwoods,
I suppose.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.159
Only I was around when
it actually happened.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.530
When what happened?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.728
A long time ago

15:03.769 --> 15:08.365
before you were born
when I was just a boy.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.743
There was a man named
Thomas Crowley.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.679
He lived out there in
Honey Island Swamp

15:15.714 --> 15:17.682
with his wife Shyann.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.411
They lived alone.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.682
No kids, just the two of them.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.780
Shyann was sick,

15:24.823 --> 15:28.554
some sort of stomach cancer
eating her up slowly

15:28.594 --> 15:30.892
and gradually taking its time.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.296
Now the way I always heard it

15:33.332 --> 15:36.233
Shyann had a nurse named Lena

15:36.268 --> 15:40.364
a beautiful Cajun woman who
would come by to tend to her.

15:41.740 --> 15:45.073
And over the long months
of Shyann's passing,

15:45.110 --> 15:48.876
Thomas and Lena got closer.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.076
Too close.

16:11.236 --> 16:15.366
Call Thomas Crowley a cheat,
call him an infidel,

16:15.407 --> 16:17.341
but given the circumstances,

16:17.376 --> 16:22.143
the entire situation was
nothing but sad and tragic.

16:22.181 --> 16:25.082
With his wife as good as dead
for so many years,

16:25.117 --> 16:30.180
it was only a matter of time until the
pain and suffering of his own emotions

16:30.222 --> 16:33.555
needed to be addressed.

16:33.592 --> 16:37.892
It took almost a year of Thomas
and Lena carrying on in secret

16:37.930 --> 16:43.994
before the day came when Shyann
finally found peace from her suffering.

16:53.112 --> 16:56.843
But the moment was not
so much a release

16:56.882 --> 16:59.817
as it was a nightmare.

17:10.996 --> 17:11.859
No!

17:13.531 --> 17:16.968
She put a curse on Thomas Crowley
and his mistress, Lena,

17:17.002 --> 17:19.698
a curse that would not only damn them

17:19.738 --> 17:23.367
but the bastard child that was
already growing in Lena's belly.

17:32.251 --> 17:33.684
No.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.719
They say that on the day
Victor Crowley was born,

17:40.759 --> 17:43.023
the swamp mourned.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.654
The trees wept.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.722
The wildlife became sickly and died.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.530
His presence was like a pestilence

17:50.569 --> 17:54.437
that turned the area into death.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.141
Come on.
There it is.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.441
Push, push.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.345
Push. There it is.
Come on.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.940
Come on. One more.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.721
Here it comes.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.280
One more, one more.

18:15.861 --> 18:20.491
Victor Crowley was born ridden with
grotesque tumors, disease

18:20.532 --> 18:21.089
and pain.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.000
Let me see.
Let me see it!

18:24.036 --> 18:25.663
A living monster.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.735
And Lena...

18:33.846 --> 18:37.839
Some say she died the moment
she laid eyes on her child.

18:43.388 --> 18:46.880
Now the legend would
have you believe that Mr. Crowley

18:46.925 --> 18:51.521
kept his son hidden away
to protect him,

18:51.563 --> 18:54.555
but what he was really hiding

18:54.600 --> 18:59.230
was his mistake, his infidelity

18:59.271 --> 19:01.398
and his curse.

19:12.117 --> 19:16.781
Over the years, Thomas Crowley
learned to love his monster of a son.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.416
With just the two of them
being hidden away,

19:19.458 --> 19:22.256
he made his peace with God.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.626
And on that fateful
Halloween night...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.465
Thomas tried to save his son

19:30.502 --> 19:32.936
by chopping through the door
with a hatchet

19:35.541 --> 19:37.566
and by accident,

19:37.609 --> 19:39.600
killed his only son.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.314
Get out here!

19:44.616 --> 19:47.813
Get out here and
get what's coming to you!

19:47.853 --> 19:51.220
You can't hide forever!

19:51.256 --> 19:53.918
You killed my son.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.955
You killed my son.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.793
You killed my son.

20:02.834 --> 20:07.396
The children responsible
hid behind their parents,

20:07.439 --> 20:09.031
denied everything

20:09.074 --> 20:13.773
and left Thomas Crowley to live out
the rest of his days in anguish.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.313
You killed my son.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.943
Years later, he finally passed

20:19.985 --> 20:23.386
and the torture of this life was over.

20:23.422 --> 20:27.882
But Victor Crowley would become
one of the most tragic

20:27.926 --> 20:34.422
and heartbreaking tales of Louisiana.

20:34.466 --> 20:37.902
A man trapped in the night
he was killed,

20:37.936 --> 20:41.736
still out there,
wandering the swamp

20:41.773 --> 20:47.211
each night trying to find his daddy.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.478
No one knows the body count,

20:50.515 --> 20:53.382
but for years after he died,
fishermen,

20:58.924 --> 21:00.221
gator hunters,

21:09.534 --> 21:12.799
and those who were just too
foolish to heed the tales,

21:12.838 --> 21:15.136
all disappeared in that swamp

21:15.173 --> 21:18.768
mutilated, murdered, massacred

21:18.810 --> 21:22.246
and torn to pieces by the ghost

21:22.281 --> 21:23.873
of Victor Crowley.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.284
What does that have to do with me?

21:27.319 --> 21:30.982
Your father, Samson,

21:31.023 --> 21:34.390
was one of the three kids
who murdered Victor Crowley.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.267
An accident, yes,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.771
but a tragedy that has left
Honey Island Swamp

21:46.805 --> 21:49.672
cursed with the ghost of
Victor Crowley forever.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.437
Uh.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.410
I... I never--

21:53.445 --> 21:55.003
Of course.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.480
How could you know?

21:56.515 --> 21:58.745
How do you know
that my dad was involved?

21:58.784 --> 22:06.520
Because if I had been brave enough,
I would have been out there too.

22:06.558 --> 22:10.688
I'm an old acquaintance of Samson.

22:10.729 --> 22:13.562
- When Crowley came after us last night--
- You saw him?

22:13.598 --> 22:14.963
Yes.

22:16.435 --> 22:19.063
He looked at me

22:19.104 --> 22:21.470
like he knew me.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.703
Perhaps he could sense
who you really were.

22:24.743 --> 22:27.974
Perhaps it was all on your mind.

22:28.013 --> 22:34.213
Victor Crowley is what's known in
the paranormal world as a repeater.

22:34.252 --> 22:37.915
His tragic and untimely death
has left him forced to relive

22:37.956 --> 22:43.826
that moment night after night,
over and over.

22:43.862 --> 22:50.392
All he knows is the fear and
revenge towards anybody who
steps foot in that swamp.

22:50.435 --> 22:53.165
You knew all this was real

22:53.205 --> 23:00.543
yet you still sent a tour boat
full of innocent people in there?

23:00.579 --> 23:02.069
For what?

23:03.915 --> 23:05.405
For what?
For money?

23:05.450 --> 23:06.644
Shaun.

23:06.685 --> 23:09.347
He wasn't supposed
to get that close.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.380
He wasn't supposed
to stop for nothing.

23:12.424 --> 23:15.450
Now I've had boats go into
that swamp for months now,

23:15.494 --> 23:18.190
two months now,
with no worries.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.562
Besides you knew the legend.

23:20.599 --> 23:24.091
You went in there knowing
the story as did your father,

23:24.136 --> 23:24.693
I went in--

23:24.736 --> 23:27.034
who more than anybody
should have known better.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.870
I went in there to find them

23:29.908 --> 23:32.638
and I did!

23:32.677 --> 23:37.273
Not many people have seen
the face of Victor Crowley

23:37.315 --> 23:39.180
and lived to tell about it.

23:39.217 --> 23:41.515
Consider yourself lucky.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.282
Lucky?

23:43.321 --> 23:48.122
My family is gone!

23:48.160 --> 23:50.560
I'm sorry for your loss.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.027
- Take me back there.
- What?

23:56.501 --> 24:01.063
I can't leave them there.
Please.

24:01.106 --> 24:07.670
Please.
I just wanna take them home.

24:07.712 --> 24:11.341
What you want is revenge.

24:11.383 --> 24:14.181
It's a bad idea, Marybeth Dunston.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.880
Bad idea.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.411
Please.

24:18.156 --> 24:21.523
Please.
I just wanna bury my family.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.596
And if I can take that
monster out with me,

24:30.769 --> 24:32.464
then all the better.

24:35.006 --> 24:38.066
You can't kill him.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.168
He'll just be reborn.

24:40.212 --> 24:44.774
He's supposed to return to the
state he was when he was killed.

24:44.816 --> 24:49.082
You can't kill a ghost.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.681
Or maybe I can't.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.715
Or maybe I can.

24:57.028 --> 25:03.126
But I am gonna bury that hatchet
deep into his fucking face!

25:12.043 --> 25:16.104
Or would you rather I go to the police and
tell them about your swamp tour business?

25:21.920 --> 25:25.412
Maybe tell them where to find
the bodies of a boat full of tourists

25:25.457 --> 25:28.790
that you sent in there illegally, huh?

25:28.827 --> 25:30.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.862
All right.

25:32.898 --> 25:34.365
Yes?

25:38.403 --> 25:42.772
You want revenge on Victor Crowley?

25:42.807 --> 25:45.071
I want you to find it.

25:45.110 --> 25:48.443
So you'll take me back in there?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.108
But I have some conditions.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.481
We're not going in there alone.
We need help.

25:53.518 --> 25:55.008
We need guns.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.682
And there's a few specific people
that I feel safer having along.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.886
Fine, if you take me
back in there tonight.

26:01.927 --> 26:04.760
Now, you meet me here at 2 o'clock.

26:04.796 --> 26:07.162
I have some phone calls to make.

26:07.198 --> 26:12.864
I'm gonna gather together a little
hunting expedition of sorts.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.533
With that ghost gone,
I can clear that swamp.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.634
You know, I don't care about
your swamp tour business.

26:18.677 --> 26:19.871
I don't care about your money.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.539
I just want to bring my family home.

26:22.581 --> 26:27.245
- If you think that bring--
- I said... yes.

26:27.285 --> 26:33.520
But you know, I think it would be better
if you didn't go in there alone.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.458
Do you have somebody you can bring,

26:35.493 --> 26:39.452
boyfriend or an uncle perhaps?

26:39.497 --> 26:41.965
I'm not bringing anybody else
I know into this.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.331
Uh-uh.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.131
I'd feel better if you brought somebody,

26:45.170 --> 26:46.933
if you brought another
family member with you.

26:46.972 --> 26:47.996
No.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.202
Then no deal.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.809
So if I bring my uncle back,
then you will take us?

26:56.848 --> 26:58.406
That's what I said.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.121
I'll be back at 2:00.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.918
I'll be here.

27:16.167 --> 27:16.963
Justin!

27:18.603 --> 27:20.002
Justin!

27:20.038 --> 27:22.598
Get your butt down here!

27:22.641 --> 27:24.040
Yeah, boss?

27:24.075 --> 27:25.099
When were you gonna tell me

27:25.143 --> 27:27.168
that your brother didn't
bring the boat back?

27:27.212 --> 27:28.679
Oh, he didn't?

27:34.319 --> 27:36.048
So Shaun didn't bring the boat back
last night?

27:36.087 --> 27:36.781
Uh-uh.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.345
Look, he's just new at this.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.585
I'm sure things are fine... he's
probably got the boat back by now.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.093
That was your shift.
He was covering for you, okay?

27:43.128 --> 27:46.655
He didn't bring the boat back
and everything's not all right.

27:46.698 --> 27:47.892
Why?
What... what's wrong?

27:47.932 --> 27:49.923
We gotta go out there
and recover my boat.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.401
Shaun's still in the swamp?

27:51.436 --> 27:52.334
Apparently.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.962
Is he all right?

27:54.005 --> 27:56.303
I'm sure he will be all right.

27:56.341 --> 28:00.835
I need you to go out and organize a group
of hunters and fishermen,

28:00.879 --> 28:03.609
people that know
the way around the swamp.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.912
I got a proposition to make them

28:05.950 --> 28:10.046
and you make sure that
this name is on the list.

28:10.088 --> 28:15.151
We're going on a little expedition.

28:15.193 --> 28:19.357
Is this like a
publicity thing for the shop?

28:19.397 --> 28:21.194
Something like that.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.257
Hello?

28:56.835 --> 28:58.826
Who's there?

28:58.870 --> 29:00.030
Hello?

29:00.071 --> 29:01.766
Marybeth? Samson?

29:01.806 --> 29:03.205
Uncle Bob?

29:03.241 --> 29:04.833
I'll be right down.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.377
Your father was a good man,
you know that.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.475
He's always been my best friend.

29:13.518 --> 29:18.182
Even all those years I lived up north,
we'd talk all the time.

29:18.223 --> 29:20.191
Reverend Zombie said dad was

29:20.225 --> 29:22.887
one of the people responsible
for Victor Crowley's death.

29:22.927 --> 29:23.985
Is that true?

29:24.028 --> 29:25.518
Reverend Zombie?

29:25.563 --> 29:27.554
Why are you talking to that low-life?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.226
He's a thief and crook

29:29.267 --> 29:32.327
with his bogus voodoo shops
and his fake souvenirs.

29:32.370 --> 29:35.430
Well, he said that he knew
the people that were involved.

29:35.473 --> 29:36.497
He's full of horse-shit.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.101
- Reverend Zombie said--
- Reverend Zombie said!

29:39.144 --> 29:42.170
Why do you call him that?

29:42.213 --> 29:45.410
His name is Clive Washington
for Christ's sake.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.782
The only thing he's reverend of
is being an asshole.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.151
Did you know that
Victor Crowley was real?

29:51.489 --> 29:54.014
- He's not real.
- I saw him.

29:54.058 --> 29:56.151
He murdered everyone
in front of me.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.593
Let the police handle this.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.653
- First things--
- No!

29:58.696 --> 30:00.721
So you think that I'm lying?

30:03.134 --> 30:04.624
Let's take a ride.

30:04.669 --> 30:07.729
We can go to the hospital and
you can tell the cops all about it.

30:07.772 --> 30:10.935
I'm going back to the swamp
with Reverend Zombie.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.307
Over my dead body are you
going to that god damn swamp.

30:13.344 --> 30:15.209
Now you listen to me,
young lady.

30:15.246 --> 30:17.612
With your father gone,

30:17.649 --> 30:22.052
I'm responsible for you now
and I absolutely forbid you

30:22.086 --> 30:24.077
to have anything to do with
him or that swamp!

30:24.122 --> 30:26.420
He suggested
that I bring you along.

30:28.893 --> 30:31.191
- He did, didn't he?
- Mm-hmm.

30:31.229 --> 30:34.960
Come with me.
You'll see Victor Crowley is real.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.394
Let's take a ride.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.996
Can we wait?

30:41.039 --> 30:43.132
Please.
I will go to the police.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.642
I will do whatever it is that
you think that we need to do.

30:45.677 --> 30:51.616
I just... I just really
need to be alone for a bit.

30:51.649 --> 30:52.547
Come on.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.075
Please.

30:55.119 --> 30:58.179
Please, Uncle Bob,
just a few hours.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.293
All right,
I'll be back in an hour.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.195
I'll call the police myself.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.462
- Get to the bottom of this.
- Okay.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.542
Marybeth,

31:18.576 --> 31:21.704
please promise me you'll stay
away from Reverend Zombie.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.507
I promise.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.351
Ah-ha, come on in.
I see you!

31:37.395 --> 31:40.592
Welcome to Reverend Zombie's
House of Voodoo.

31:40.632 --> 31:44.193
Grab a complimentary Chips Ahoy
and take a seat.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.202
Hurry.
S'il vous plait.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.136
The meeting is about to start.

31:47.171 --> 31:49.799
Yes. Ha-ha.

31:49.841 --> 31:53.868
Bonjour, monsieur.
Welcome to the House of Voodoo.

31:53.912 --> 31:59.316
Take a seat and don't forget
we have a sale on charms and
potions today only.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.477
Drop the phony accent, asshole.

32:01.519 --> 32:05.046
I ain't no god damn tourist.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.886
Chips Ahoy?

32:06.925 --> 32:07.914
Fuck off.

32:17.568 --> 32:18.535
Hey.

32:23.641 --> 32:28.510
Ah, he-hey, uh, did you wanna
get on the mailing list?

32:28.546 --> 32:31.447
Um, you can just
gimme your number, I mean.

32:31.482 --> 32:34.349
I mean you don't have to
gimme but you...

32:34.385 --> 32:35.852
Slut.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.258
Layton?

32:41.292 --> 32:45.285
Oh, my god,
I didn't expect to see you here.

32:45.330 --> 32:46.592
Come on, Avery.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.826
What?

32:48.866 --> 32:49.764
What are you doing here?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.235
They said 500 bucks.
Why not?

32:54.405 --> 32:57.670
Okay, so this is how
we say hello now?

32:57.709 --> 33:00.109
Please.

33:00.144 --> 33:03.443
Your phone don't get
messages anymore either?

33:03.481 --> 33:05.108
You know why I'm here?

33:05.149 --> 33:08.346
I need the $500
to help pay for my wedding.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.617
My wedding, Avery.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.147
I am not getting
into this with you.

33:17.362 --> 33:18.351
I'm single.

33:18.396 --> 33:22.298
Ho, ho, ho.
Tres bein, tres bein!

33:22.333 --> 33:24.130
Welcome.
All right, everyone.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.863
Thanks or as the French say,

33:25.903 --> 33:28.838
merci for coming down here
on such short notice.

33:28.873 --> 33:32.206
I know you are all busy people.

33:32.243 --> 33:32.800
Yes?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.141
Hey, man,
what's the deal with cookies?

33:34.178 --> 33:36.544
Is it just like one each or could
we get some more or what's up?

33:36.581 --> 33:38.708
I have more cookies but first,
can we, uh...

33:38.750 --> 33:41.241
Okay, so do we get them now
or like after the meeting?

33:41.285 --> 33:44.345
Or... what's the time stamp
on them cookies there?

33:44.389 --> 33:45.287
Fine.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.455
There it is.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.106
Bon appétit.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.364
Good afternoon, everybody.

34:33.404 --> 34:37.362
Good to see so many friends
with familiar faces here today.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.875
John.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.643
Cleatus.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.248
Trent.

34:45.783 --> 34:49.844
I brought y'all here today to make
you an offer, to offer you a job.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.150
It's a quick gig.
We do it tonight.

34:52.190 --> 34:57.856
And for those of you that join me,
there's $500 in it for you.

34:57.895 --> 35:00.455
And I assume the money
will be in cash?

35:00.498 --> 35:03.831
Not that any of us here
don't trust a check from you,

35:03.868 --> 35:07.031
it's that we really want
to get the money.

35:10.441 --> 35:14.673
In cash,
when the job is done.

35:14.712 --> 35:18.113
Last night, I lost one of my tour
boats out there in that swamp,

35:18.149 --> 35:20.344
so I'm putting together a
group of sorts to go in there,

35:20.384 --> 35:24.821
retrieve my boat, and in addition,
go on a little night hunt.

35:24.856 --> 35:27.120
Why do you need
this many people to find a boat?

35:27.158 --> 35:29.388
If you stop interrupting me,
I'll tell you.

35:29.427 --> 35:34.592
Now, of course, I'm not offering you
y'all $500 just to retrieve a boat.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.224
I'm gonna be honest with you.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.929
There's more to it
and it could be dangerous.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.232
Hey man, do y'all got any milk?

35:40.271 --> 35:41.636
- What?
- Milk, man.

35:41.672 --> 35:42.900
Milk for the cookies, man.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.430
Milk. Milk?

35:44.475 --> 35:45.965
No milk.

35:48.713 --> 35:50.647
We're going to
Honey Island swamp.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.148
Honey Island's closed.
We can't even go in there.

35:52.183 --> 35:56.051
I know that.
That's why I'm offering y'all $500,

35:56.087 --> 35:59.989
and in addition, I'm willing to
take on full legal responsibility

36:00.024 --> 36:02.720
in case there'll be any trouble
with the authorities.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.591
So it won't be any risk
to any of y'all.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.187
What exactly are we gonna be hunting?

36:06.230 --> 36:07.458
I'm getting to that.

36:07.498 --> 36:13.198
As you know that swamp has been closed
and condemned for too many years,

36:13.237 --> 36:15.603
and it's been crippling my tourism business

36:15.640 --> 36:18.609
and it's been stopping those of you
who make your living hunting

36:18.643 --> 36:22.079
an entire area rich with wildlife.

36:22.113 --> 36:24.138
So I'm proposing we put a little hunt,

36:24.182 --> 36:27.345
go in there and prove once and
for all that there's nothing to fear.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.148
What are we hunting?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.325
Victor Crowley.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.187
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

36:37.228 --> 36:38.490
Now hold on, now.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.826
Hold on!

36:39.864 --> 36:41.832
Now, listen to me.
Listen to me.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.426
Now if there really is some
maniac living up there,

36:44.468 --> 36:47.631
we just go in there, take them down
and make the area safe again.

36:47.672 --> 36:50.539
All right, now,
y'all know that's just a story

36:50.575 --> 36:54.841
so we go in there and put an end
to all this swamp water stupidity.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.073
Not l.

36:56.113 --> 36:58.308
Now, now, now, now.
Come on. Come on, everyone...

36:58.950 --> 37:00.474
Hey, come on now, big guy.

37:00.518 --> 37:02.952
Trent, where you going?

37:02.987 --> 37:04.249
You scared of something?

37:04.288 --> 37:06.279
You know I ain't scared of nothing,

37:06.324 --> 37:08.792
but I ain't about to go
messing around in that swamp

37:08.826 --> 37:11.590
with a crew of stomp-jumping
pecker woods for no 500 bucks.

37:11.629 --> 37:13.893
Hey, I need you, all right?

37:13.931 --> 37:15.455
Now you're the best shot around here.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.592
You know that.
That's why I called for you.

37:17.635 --> 37:21.196
I ain't riskin' my hide
for 500 stinking dollars.

37:21.239 --> 37:25.539
Five hundred dollars up front
just for you.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.771
Clive, you know my history.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.837
I don't want no more trouble.

37:35.586 --> 37:42.048
I also know that after your last DUI,
Joan left you, took the house,

37:42.093 --> 37:46.086
half of everything you have,
hanging on a hook.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.961
That ain't the history I'm talking about.

37:47.999 --> 37:51.662
One thousand dollars cash,
$500 right now up front,

37:51.702 --> 37:53.727
$500 in the morning.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.331
One night and we'll all
be together, huh?

37:56.374 --> 37:59.070
Anything bad goes down, we...

37:59.110 --> 38:01.044
leave.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.413
Hmm?

38:08.819 --> 38:10.286
Yeah.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.554
May I help you?

38:21.232 --> 38:24.360
Oh, you must be Marybeth's uncle.

38:24.402 --> 38:25.699
I'm Reverend Zombie.

38:25.736 --> 38:28.705
I was a friend of Samson,
but you and I never officially met.

38:28.739 --> 38:30.673
I don't care to know you.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.108
I'm here to look after
the young lady.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.388
I'm sorry.

38:46.424 --> 38:49.018
I... I just need--

38:49.060 --> 38:51.585
I'll do this with you if... if it's what
you need to do right now,

38:51.629 --> 38:53.460
I'll do it with you.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.989
But then we gather up your father
and your brother and we come back here.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.561
No more of this Victor Crowley shit.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.629
You gotta listen to me.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.972
You can't leave my side,
you can't leave my sight,

39:06.010 --> 39:09.639
and when I say it's time to go,
we leave.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.113
Thank you.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.684
Hey, man.
Who's Victor Crowley?

39:15.720 --> 39:16.982
Well, he's nothing,

39:17.021 --> 39:20.787
a local boogeyman story about a
retarded maniac who haunts Honey Island.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.726
People just use it to keep kids
away from the swamp.

39:23.761 --> 39:27.060
You mean like a Jason Voorhees
or something?

39:27.098 --> 39:29.328
Something like that.

I lived in this town called Glen Echo.

Now that we've weeded out
the gullible, the cowards,

bringing back my boat.

39:47.051 --> 39:51.920
Five thousand dollars for
the head of Victor Crowley.

39:51.956 --> 39:55.289
Yeah, but how are we suppose to know
if we found him if he's not a real dude?

39:55.326 --> 39:58.090

this whole story is a joke,

I'd rather be surrounded by
the big guns.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.062
Wouldn't you?

42:14.098 --> 42:15.861

42:15.900 --> 42:18.266
Ah, but if the legend is true,

42:18.302 --> 42:22.329
then there really is a ghost
or maybe not.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.035
I hurt him last night.

42:25.075 --> 42:29.944
I shot him, I stabbed him,
I burned him.

42:29.980 --> 42:31.345
He kept coming.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.077
But you hurt him.

42:33.117 --> 42:35.449
He went down every time.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.612
He felt pain.

42:36.654 --> 42:39.214
Then maybe the thing is to
hit him even worse.

42:39.256 --> 42:42.783
Hit him so hard, take his head off,
so he can't come back.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.920
What did you call him,
a repeater?

42:45.963 --> 42:49.797
But doesn't that mean that he will
just come back again the next night?

42:49.833 --> 42:53.360
I don't have answers,
only theories.

42:53.404 --> 42:57.500
But I have to assume that, uh,
if we take off his head,

42:57.541 --> 42:59.907
then he can't come back at all.

46:13.737 --> 46:16.069
I'm just not exactly sure
where we got off.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.368
Why'd you guys get off the boat?

46:17.407 --> 46:18.704
Well, I don't wanna linger.

46:18.742 --> 46:20.710
- Let's get to the house.
- What house?

46:20.744 --> 46:23.212
My daddy and my brother
are in the shed.

46:23.247 --> 46:25.112
Why were they in the shed?

46:25.149 --> 46:26.582
What house?

46:26.617 --> 46:28.209
It's scary out here.

46:28.252 --> 46:31.119
Oh, that's just 'cause people
want you to think it's scary.

46:31.155 --> 46:32.747
It's no different
than any other swamp.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.759
Have you noticed that
there's hardly even any birds?

46:35.793 --> 46:37.454
Doesn't matter.

46:37.494 --> 46:41.021
But don't let that
clown spook you.

46:41.064 --> 46:43.555
All you gotta do,
hang out here for a few hours,

46:43.600 --> 46:45.727
collect our money, and go home.

46:45.769 --> 46:47.066
Screw that.

46:47.104 --> 46:49.595
I'm taking out that
Crowley monster guy.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.335
5000 bucks,
I could be out of debt.

46:51.375 --> 46:55.402
Ha! Out of all these guys,
you'll get him?

46:55.445 --> 46:56.969
I'm a better shot than you.

46:57.014 --> 46:57.946
That's not true.

46:57.981 --> 47:00.472
Okay, Garden District Fair,
two years ago.

47:00.517 --> 47:03.748
I was drunk and I let you win.

47:03.787 --> 47:07.883
Right, kinda like how you let me win
at air hockey and at pool?

47:07.925 --> 47:09.688
I was sick.

47:09.726 --> 47:10.920
You're adorable.

47:12.062 --> 47:14.053
Fucking mosquitoes!

47:14.097 --> 47:15.530
Hey, man.
I got some spray if you want.

47:15.566 --> 47:17.796
Yeah.

47:17.835 --> 47:18.893
Sweet. Thanks.

47:18.936 --> 47:20.927
Do you believe the whole
ghost story about this place?

47:20.971 --> 47:21.938
I believe there was a story,

47:21.972 --> 47:24.907
but I believe there's a ghost
that can actually hurt somebody.

47:24.942 --> 47:28.378
Right.
Look, I've been thinking

47:28.412 --> 47:32.644
if a ghost takes on physical presence
and manifests itself,

47:32.683 --> 47:34.878
then what's to stop it from
going after somebody?

47:34.918 --> 47:37.478
Damn, man, you need to stop
watching The Syfy Channel.

47:37.521 --> 47:40.649
If that ghost does manifest his ass,
I'll shoot his head off.

47:41.725 --> 47:43.090
Hey, man,
you want some bug spray?

47:44.561 --> 47:45.926
Man, he don't talk a lot, huh?

47:45.963 --> 47:47.726
What, who, John?
No, man he's a riot.

47:47.764 --> 47:50.631
He used to do stand-up down at
Fancy Wigs, man. Real hilarious.

47:50.667 --> 47:51.964
- Seriously?
- No.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.040
Hey, man,
careful with 'em cigarettes.

47:59.076 --> 48:00.407
They'll kill you, you know.

48:00.444 --> 48:02.241
Shut up, Chad.

48:06.350 --> 48:07.248
Dicks!

48:07.284 --> 48:09.081
Well, where the hell are we going?

48:10.754 --> 48:12.517
I don't know, okay.

48:12.556 --> 48:14.183
We came in a different way.

48:14.224 --> 48:16.658
Just how much farther in
you expect us to go, little girl?

48:16.693 --> 48:18.661
Yeah. I'd like to stay
closer to the boats.

48:18.695 --> 48:22.426
Uh, we came in through there,
so the boats are a straight shot back.

48:22.466 --> 48:24.058
So what now?

48:24.101 --> 48:25.568
Let's surround the area,

48:25.602 --> 48:28.833
if Victor Crowley really does exist,
this is where we find him.

48:28.872 --> 48:31.204
So is this some kind of
Victor Crowley call or something?

48:38.282 --> 48:39.647
So, what,
we break up into groups?

48:39.683 --> 48:41.048
No.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.210
That's a bad idea.

48:42.252 --> 48:43.651
No, no. He's right.

48:43.687 --> 48:45.951
That way, we can
cover more ground.

48:45.989 --> 48:49.686
All right now, if you see that
monster out there, shoot.

48:49.726 --> 48:52.661
Now, wait just a damn minute.

48:52.696 --> 48:56.632
We don't want a bunch of spooked
people walking around this swamp
shooting at everything.

48:56.667 --> 48:59.227
Man, who you calling spooked?

48:59.269 --> 49:00.133
I'm going with the big guy.

49:00.170 --> 49:02.161
The fuck you are, boy.

49:02.205 --> 49:04.173
I'm fixin' to keep a eye
on my money.

49:04.207 --> 49:06.107
Come on, let's find that
shed and get out of here.

49:06.143 --> 49:07.201
Hey, wait a minute.

49:07.244 --> 49:08.643
Wait a minute!

49:08.679 --> 49:09.611
What's the plan?

49:09.646 --> 49:11.170
The plan?

49:11.214 --> 49:13.808
We meet back at the boat at sun up.

49:13.850 --> 49:18.685
And if you do find that monster,
bring back his head... 5K.

49:18.722 --> 49:20.587
Trent, you come with us.

49:31.735 --> 49:33.225
What do you want to do?

49:34.571 --> 49:36.869
Stick with these guys tonight.

49:36.907 --> 49:38.807
Wait here till tomorrow
and get out of here.

49:39.943 --> 49:44.312
Well, all right,
this hunter's Daddy Eddy.

49:44.348 --> 49:46.748
I don't want to hang out
with these idiots all night.

49:48.018 --> 49:49.781
All right, come on.

49:51.655 --> 49:55.421
Whoa-whoa, hey, man, what, you're
going to take the pretty thing in the
swamp with you?

49:55.459 --> 49:57.359
Yeah, man. We're cool.

49:57.394 --> 49:58.656
Thanks.

49:59.696 --> 50:01.755
Oh, okay, I get it.

50:01.798 --> 50:03.823
Y'all a couple
or something, huh?

50:03.867 --> 50:05.960
My bad.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.563
Hey man, I got an idea.
Why don't we all just split up?

50:08.605 --> 50:11.005
Hey, better yet,
let's just go skinny dipping.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.168
Hey, I don't know about you.

50:13.210 --> 50:16.304
I'm gonna go catch me a gator,
hang out down by the boats.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.940
Well, I like the idea of
sticking near them boats.

50:18.982 --> 50:21.007
I don't want nobody
leaving without me.

50:21.051 --> 50:24.282
Stick with me, pal.
Make it worth our while.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.325
And then, it was just us.

50:34.231 --> 50:35.459
Are you scared, man?

50:40.537 --> 50:41.970
Boo!

50:57.988 --> 50:59.649
Ow.

51:03.093 --> 51:03.718
Damn it!

51:03.760 --> 51:07.924
Swamp overflowing with gators
and I can't hit one!

51:07.964 --> 51:09.454
You gotta lead it more.

51:09.499 --> 51:11.330
Dude, I know how to hunt.

51:11.368 --> 51:13.461
Yeah.
That's why you keep missing.

51:15.505 --> 51:19.839
So, uh, are we supposed to
stand around here all night?

51:19.876 --> 51:22.674
Unless you want to go sniffing
around in there with them assholes.

51:22.712 --> 51:24.043
No, no.

51:24.081 --> 51:28.450
I'm good here but,
man, 5000 bucks...

51:28.485 --> 51:30.817
To hunt down a children story?

51:30.854 --> 51:32.116
Good luck!

51:32.155 --> 51:34.817
And the only reason Zombie's
even offering that reward,

51:34.858 --> 51:38.487
because there ain't no Victor Crowley.

51:38.528 --> 51:40.496
I mean, we're gonna end up
staying up all night

51:40.530 --> 51:44.296
just so we can go back and
declare the swamp safe and

51:44.334 --> 51:47.497
be able to start up his tours
or some bullshit.

51:47.537 --> 51:49.334
How do you know the story ain't real?

51:49.372 --> 51:50.839
Please.

51:50.874 --> 51:52.364
If that story was real...

51:52.409 --> 51:55.503
I mean, if I even thought
that story was real,

51:55.545 --> 51:57.308
my ass wouldn't be here right now.

52:00.283 --> 52:02.478
All right, see how he's
moving to the right?

52:02.519 --> 52:03.781
Shut up.

52:04.821 --> 52:05.788
Two feet to the right.

52:05.822 --> 52:07.289
Shut up.

52:08.892 --> 52:10.985
Yeah! Whoo!

52:11.027 --> 52:11.823
Did you see that?

52:11.862 --> 52:13.352
Wait. Shut up.

52:14.331 --> 52:14.990
Did you hear something?

52:15.031 --> 52:19.491
- Yeah, I heard that gator decide to come
home with me, that's what I heard.
- No! Shh!

52:19.536 --> 52:21.128
Listen.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.081
Oh, come on.

52:34.818 --> 52:37.378
All right, we hear you Vernon.
It's funny.

52:37.420 --> 52:38.444
That was Vernon?

52:38.488 --> 52:39.785
Of course, it was.

52:40.757 --> 52:42.554
I see him.

52:42.592 --> 52:43.456
Shut the fuck up.

52:45.061 --> 52:46.119
It's out in front of us.

52:48.198 --> 52:49.358
Vernon?

52:50.300 --> 52:52.268
Cut it out or you're gonna get hurt.

52:53.703 --> 52:54.567
Yeah.

52:55.505 --> 52:56.767
I'm serious.

53:00.877 --> 53:03.209
Knock it off right now
or you're gonna get shot.

53:04.714 --> 53:06.181
I'm serious now.

53:10.954 --> 53:12.387
Oh!
Oh, fuck!

53:12.422 --> 53:15.949
No! No! No!

53:15.992 --> 53:17.516
No!

54:10.614 --> 54:11.945
Hey, boss, hold on.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.176
Come on.

54:14.618 --> 54:17.519
What are we really doing here?

54:17.554 --> 54:20.751
We're gonna go through there,
get the people that were on that boat,

54:20.790 --> 54:23.020
and we're gonna bring them back home.

54:23.059 --> 54:25.653
Come on.
I'm not an idiot, okay.

54:25.695 --> 54:28.391
Why do you need all these people?
Why all the guns?

54:28.431 --> 54:30.831
All right,

54:30.867 --> 54:32.391
listen to me, Justin.

54:32.435 --> 54:33.367
Listen to me.

54:33.403 --> 54:37.464
If what the girl is saying is correct
and Victor Crowley is still out there,

54:37.507 --> 54:39.134
I know how to get rid of him.

54:39.175 --> 54:41.075
I know how to end the curse.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.305
And how is that?

54:42.345 --> 54:44.643
- You see those two right there?
- Yeah.

54:44.681 --> 54:47.514
They were out here the night
that Crowley got murdered.

54:47.550 --> 54:49.108
Oh, the night the house got lit on fire?

54:49.152 --> 54:50.551
Yes.

54:50.587 --> 54:52.145
There were three of them.

54:52.188 --> 54:55.282
Samson, the girl's father,
was the other one.

54:55.325 --> 54:57.657
So that means
there's only two more to go

54:57.694 --> 55:00.128
before his revenge is satisfied

55:00.163 --> 55:04.224
and the curse will be lifted,
and the swamp is mine.

55:04.267 --> 55:07.498
Wait. That's... that's like murder.

55:09.372 --> 55:11.169
Am I hurting anybody?

55:11.207 --> 55:13.300
Did I twist anybody's
arm to come out here?

55:13.343 --> 55:15.311
They came here
on their own free will.

55:15.345 --> 55:17.370
Yeah, because you bribed them.

55:20.050 --> 55:21.984
You got a problem with this, Justin?

55:22.018 --> 55:24.509
Do you have a problem with me?

55:24.554 --> 55:27.216
I just...

55:27.257 --> 55:29.248
No.

55:29.292 --> 55:33.228
Look, I just wanna find Shaun
and get the hell out of here.

55:33.263 --> 55:34.924
Is Shaun all right?

55:39.602 --> 55:41.900
I don't know.

55:41.938 --> 55:44.406
But you wouldn't tell me the truth
if you did know, would you?

55:44.441 --> 55:46.306
Look at me.

55:46.343 --> 55:49.642
The girl doesn't know
what happened to Shaun either.

55:49.679 --> 55:51.306
The group got split up.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.908
But I'm sure he's
out there somewhere.

55:53.950 --> 55:55.850
He'll be fine. Trust me.

55:55.885 --> 55:57.978
Now we all have to stick together.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.353
Everything is going to be fine.

56:00.390 --> 56:01.857
He's a tough kid.

56:03.560 --> 56:04.959
He ain't that tough.

56:06.129 --> 56:07.426
♪♪

56:26.983 --> 56:28.007
Come on.

56:33.623 --> 56:34.783
Come on.

56:48.905 --> 56:50.236
Yeah. Ah.

57:22.038 --> 57:24.131
You're not the least bit
creeped out here?

57:24.174 --> 57:25.539
You're really freaked out, huh?

57:25.575 --> 57:27.440
Well, yeah.

57:27.477 --> 57:29.138
You don't need to be scared.

57:37.921 --> 57:40.754
Besides,
if a monster comes to get you,

57:40.790 --> 57:43.258
we've got guns, right?

57:43.293 --> 57:44.419
I guess.

57:55.171 --> 57:57.935
Remember... remember in high school,

57:57.974 --> 58:00.465
when I told you I couldn't get my
driver's license because I was sick

58:00.510 --> 58:01.909
and couldn't make it to the DMV?

58:01.945 --> 58:02.912
Yeah.

58:04.347 --> 58:05.780
I lied.

58:05.815 --> 58:06.975
And I failed.

58:07.016 --> 58:09.746
Guy told me to parallel park
and I totally nailed the other car.

58:09.786 --> 58:13.313
Where did that come from?

58:13.356 --> 58:14.414
I don't know.

58:14.457 --> 58:17.119
I guess l... I just felt like saying it.

58:18.761 --> 58:20.126
Want to know something?

58:20.163 --> 58:21.755
What?

58:21.798 --> 58:23.060
I knew.

58:23.099 --> 58:23.588
How?

58:23.633 --> 58:24.964
Remember my Aunt May?

58:25.001 --> 58:27.526
She worked at the DMV.
She told me the whole thing.

58:27.570 --> 58:29.128
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:32.275 --> 58:34.709
Then why didn't you ever
call me on it?

58:34.744 --> 58:40.376
'Cause I had a crush on you
and I felt bad, I guess.

58:42.352 --> 58:43.876
Stop.

58:45.054 --> 58:46.316
No.

58:51.394 --> 58:53.692
Wait, you know
I still care about you, right?

58:56.199 --> 58:59.396
I don't... I don't... I don't
know what's going on.

59:05.542 --> 59:06.702
Fuck it.

59:16.886 --> 59:18.183
Here!
It's here.

59:18.221 --> 59:19.620
They're in here.

59:25.628 --> 59:27.357
They were here.

59:27.397 --> 59:30.833
Both of them,
their bodies were right here.

59:30.867 --> 59:32.926
Shh, it's okay.

59:32.969 --> 59:35.767
Shh, shh, shh.

59:35.805 --> 59:37.136
Are you happy now?

59:37.173 --> 59:39.971
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

59:40.009 --> 59:41.203
Look, I'm sure they were here,

59:41.244 --> 59:43.610
but, look,
there's nothing here now!

59:43.646 --> 59:45.580
They were right there.

59:45.615 --> 59:47.742
Well then, maybe... maybe it was
a different shed.

59:47.784 --> 59:50.150
- Maybe you were just scared.
- No, I know what I saw.

59:50.186 --> 59:53.383
I saw them with my own eyes.

59:53.423 --> 59:58.417
Crowley, maybe... maybe he
took them inside the house.

59:58.461 --> 59:59.428
Marybeth!

59:59.462 --> 01:00:01.430
Hey, the girl's had quite a scare...

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:05.666
Brave little gal.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.397
Hey, you just can't run up there!

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.529
Oh, let them go.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.969
Boss, if you don't mind,
I'd really like to just find my brother

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.342
and get the fuck out of here.

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:19.405
No, it's safer if we stick together.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.711
Shaun!

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.217
- Shaun!
- Son,

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:25.277
I'm gonna give you about one
more second to knock that shit off.

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:29.587
Fuck.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.889
You like that?

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.122
Yes.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.096
Yes. Fuck.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:36.530
Oh, yeah.

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:37.624
Did you miss that?

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:38.565
I did.
I really did.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.091
Oh, how much?
How much you missed it?

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.728
The most.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.238
The most amount.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.570
You like this better than ice cream?

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.097
Yep.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.336
Oh, yeah.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.538
- Better than chocolate ice cream?
- Yep.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:50.773
Fuck chocolate ice cream.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.246
Oh, yeah.

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.078
You like this better than Jesus?

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.216
That's just... that's not appropriate.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.653
Oh, you like this
better than Baby Jesus?

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:04.922
Ah, about... about an equal amount.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.428
Oh, yeah.

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.225
You love me?

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:10.960
What?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.524
Do you love me?

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:13.398
Yep.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.433
How much do you love me?

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.666
Yep.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.870
- What? I can't hear you.
- Huh?

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.312
Tell me you love me.

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:28.006
I love you.

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.417
Say it.
Say you love me.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.288
Say it!

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.848
- Tell me you love me!
- I love you.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.793
I love you.
I love you.

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:41.160
Yeah, you do.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.459
Oh!

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.694
Easy!

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.632
C'mon!

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.200
C'mon!

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.211
Come on.

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.679
You didn't fall asleep
on me again, did you?

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.575
Oh, my God!

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.949
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.893
Enough!

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.991
Enough of this insanity.
Come on.

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.262
They're here.

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.894
They have to be here somewhere.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.370
Come on, we're leaving right now.

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.600
Please, please, Uncle Bobby,
you have to believe me.

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.734
Well, then, we'll come back tomorrow
during the day.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.369
We'll bring the sheriff with us.

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.002
Boss!

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.137
The sheriff isn't gonna be here...

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.910
I really wanna get out of here now!

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.007
Not yet.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.517
Please.
I'm fucking scared.

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.180
Then get back to the boat.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.813
Can I get the keys back?

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:18.491
And leave me here?

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.893
No. I won't leave.
I'll wait.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.624
The hell you will.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.830
I'm with your boy.

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:26.460
We're looking for
serious trouble being in here.

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.038
It's too late.

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.098
Shut the door!

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.643
Shut the fucking door!

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.744
Come on, give me a hand.

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:41.943
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.383
Come on, come on.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.120
Come on, man.

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.479
Come on push, push fast.

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.957
What the hell have you done?

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.963
Back off of me, old man.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:56.794
You're gonna get us all killed?

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.425
You?

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.094
You're blaming me?

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.103
What?

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.468
What are you talking about?

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.268
Y'all better shot the fuck up!

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:08.403
Hey, man, you hear that?

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:16.041
Hey, if somebody's joking around out there,
this shit ain't funny.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.347
We will shoot you.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.958
Show yourself
or we will shoot your head off.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.582
Last warning, asshole!

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.180
Shots fired.

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:55.383
Maybe they got him.

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.221
No, no.
Stay with me.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:57.988
No.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.996
Look, I can't. Look, I can't.
I can't be in here.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.054
Or I need to get back to the boat.

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.895
I just wanna find Shaun
and go home.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:10.465
Shaun... is he, is he dead?

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:12.899
They are all dead.

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:13.772
And you lied?

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:15.606
I told him the truth.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.510
You knew my brother was dead!

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.378
Quiet, kid!

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:23.442
All right, all I know is
what that crazy gal said.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.920
For all I know he could
still be out there somewhere.

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.090
He's not.

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.791
Well, what if you shot
one of the other guys, man?

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:35.023
Hello?

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.207
What the fuck?!

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.064
Oh, shit!

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.220
We're fucked in here!

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:38.385
We're fucked.
We're so fucked!

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.554
Listen to me you little piece of shit.

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:43.394
Now you stay with me
and you don't do anything stupid.

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.626
Now if I'm right

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.932
and Crowley gets his revenge on
those two people that killed him.

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.403
He's gonna have his peace.

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.565
This will all be over
and we'll be rich.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:54.098
- What if--
- Don't be a fool.

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.543
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.275
Give me your gun.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:04.343
No!

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.645
Do you see anything out there?

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:08.850
No.

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:12.383
But I find it hard to believe that
this door is the only way in.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:13.725
I'll scope it out.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.622
Now, you listen to me.
I want you to hide.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.724
I'm not hiding.

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:19.928
That's enough.

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.163
Now you hide!

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:23.265
Come on.

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:24.499
Come on!

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:00.133
I've never been
so fucking scared in my life.

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.806
I'm sorry about your brother.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.318
You could have told me earlier.

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:12.377
I thought Zombie would have told you.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.554
Are you positive?

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:22.496
But are you sure he's dead?

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.697
Why the hell would you
come back here?

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:27.667
I don't understand.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.728
My family is gone.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.261
I have nothing.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:36.111
I wanna see Crowley die.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:39.136
- But if he's a ghost--
- I hurt him last night.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.615
If he can feel pain,
then he can die.

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.519
What did he say to you?

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:52.459
I heard him say
something about "those two"?

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:58.263
He seems to think that Trent and
that guy with you, your uncle...

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.063
Bob?

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:04.334
He says that they're with your father when
they killed Victor Crowley years ago.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.397
What?

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:11.277
He thinks that if Victor Crowley
has his revenge on them that

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:15.750
the curse will be lifted and he'll
just go away, and they will be safe.

01:09:15.783 --> 01:09:17.843
That's why he brought us here?

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:18.944
I don't know shit.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.013
- All I know is--
- Uncle Bob!

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.647
Hey, no! Hey!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.613
Spiders.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.581
Oh, shit.

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:01.886
Oh, please, spiders.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:02.982
Please.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.353
Oh, fuck!

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.740
Uncle Bob!
Uncle Bob!

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:28.750
It's a trap!

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:29.273
What?

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:30.979
Reverend Zombie,
he's trying to get--

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:34.520
He's in the house!

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:36.251
Wait, no!
No, no, wait! Wait!

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:49.227
Just kill me!

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.307
Oh... Oh, God!

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:04.208
Uncle Bob, please!
Don't go!

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:05.914
This is what he wants.

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:06.978
Please listen to me.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.892
Help!
Please help me!

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:13.918
Help me!

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:27.676
Wait.

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.886
Come on, get up.
Come on.

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.052
Uncle Bob, get up.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.288
Hurry!
We have to get out of here.

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.625
Get up. Run!

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:57.325
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:58.492
What are you doing?

01:13:58.534 --> 01:13:59.694
I'm trying to save you.

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.396
Yeah, you fuck!

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.530
No, please!

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.937
Uncle Bob!

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.852
Uncle Bob!

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.778
Put her down!

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:34.433
What are you doing?
Please!

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.868
Oh, God!
Please stop!

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:42.000
I'm trying to save you.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:44.035
- I know you were gonna kill him.
- No.

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:57.319
Listen to me!

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:58.849
Listen to me.
He's going to kill you.

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:02.760
You, you're gonna kill him!

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.855
No, you're gonna kill him.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.129
- No!
- Don't lock me in here!

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.159
Uncle Bob!

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.903
No, please!
Don't leave me.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.246
- Wait!
- You want him to get you too?

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.014
- All right.
- You wanna be safe, don't you?

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.247
Come on, come on.

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.653
Uncle Bob!

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:42.529
Zombie!

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.835
Zombie, you can't leave me
with this thing!

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.569
- Uncle Bob!
- You gotta help me!

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.270
Come back!

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.801
Zombie!

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:19.899
Come on you hatchet-faced fuck!

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:27.976
Oh, God!

01:16:28.016 --> 01:16:29.347
Uncle Bob!

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:33.479
Now, now, little girl.
It's almost over.

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.581
It's almost all over.

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.256
No!

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:08.355
Now, it's all over, little girl.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:10.551
It's all over.

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:14.255
Three children set that house
on fire decades ago,

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:18.164
three children murdered
Victor Crowley,

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:25.766
Trent, your father,
and your father's brother, your uncle.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.804
The only way to rid this swamp
of that ghost's curse forever

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:37.785
is to let him have revenged
on the men that killed him.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:39.377
You see?

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:40.945
You see!

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.547
It's over!

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:44.821
Victor Crowley is gone.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.259
Gone!

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:53.398
The swamp is mine.

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:55.767
You're a murderer.

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:59.171
You never wanted to help me.

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.641
You killed all
those innocent people.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.907
No, no, no.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:07.176
Victor Crowley
murdered those people.

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.706
I just happened to survive.

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:12.049
I'm gonna tell the police what you did.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:14.578
I'm gonna tell everybody.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:19.686
That's where you're wrong,
Marybeth Dunston.

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:22.663
Well, there's something
that you got wrong.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.029
What?

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:30.160
That wasn't my real uncle.

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:34.039
Bob was my daddy's best friend.

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:38.775
My daddy's brother died
from leukemia when I was 12.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.956
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:35.653
Die, you motherfucker!

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:52.007
Go to hell!

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.974
Fuck you!
