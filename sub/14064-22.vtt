00:01.022 --> 00:02.250
What are you doing?

00:02.285 --> 00:03.444
I will help you.

00:03.479 --> 00:04.890
Now hand me the knife.

00:04.925 --> 00:06.266
It's the toast. Bingo!

00:06.301 --> 00:07.613
Asperger's Syndrome.

00:07.648 --> 00:08.079
Bingo.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.880
Jerry Espenson has been suffering
needlessly his entire life.

00:12.915 --> 00:14.047
You'll get him help?

00:14.047 --> 00:14.713
My word.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.312
Admit that you're having
an emotional affair with me,

00:17.312 --> 00:19.085
consider making it physical.

00:19.120 --> 00:23.086
You have a wife who adores you,
and for her sake, if not your own,

00:23.121 --> 00:24.598
you need to grow up.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.075
I left my wife, Shirley.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.047
Did you?

00:27.082 --> 00:28.848
So what do you think?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.018 --> 00:40.978
Thank you for walking me to work.
Can I interest you in a cup of…?

00:43.487 --> 00:45.956
I see you don't need coffee.

00:46.467 --> 00:50.219
Ivan, I'm… I'm feeling a little exposed.

00:50.254 --> 00:52.993
Wherever that is,
could you put my hand there?

00:52.993 --> 00:54.908
Besides, it's not even seven.

00:54.943 --> 00:56.910
No one else is even…

00:57.914 --> 01:01.412
One question. Who was on top?

01:01.973 --> 01:05.283
Me, her, me and then her.

01:05.318 --> 01:06.779
A little early, aren't you, Denny?

01:06.779 --> 01:08.733
I'm an early riser.

01:08.734 --> 01:10.945
As I recall Shirley, so are you.

01:10.980 --> 01:14.556
I was just desperate
to get out of your bed, Denny.

01:16.506 --> 01:18.243
Toodles.

01:19.450 --> 01:21.153
See me for lunch?

01:21.188 --> 01:22.857
I'll pick you up.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.878
Missy.

01:41.956 --> 01:44.025
I…

01:45.894 --> 01:46.851
How are you?

01:46.886 --> 01:49.490
I hope you don't mind my coming here.

01:49.491 --> 01:51.731
It's about Ivan.

01:51.766 --> 01:53.356
Of course.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.086
I know it's crazy, but…

01:58.246 --> 02:00.985
I think Ivan is cheating.

02:07.690 --> 02:07.725
Cheating? On you? His wife?

02:07.725 --> 02:12.105
Part of me thinks it's so silly.

02:12.607 --> 02:15.356
Oh, God!

02:15.964 --> 02:19.178
So, he hasn't said anything to you.

02:19.213 --> 02:20.624
Oh, of course not.

02:20.659 --> 02:23.381
But you know my man of La Mancha.

02:23.416 --> 02:29.228
He's a wanderer, Shirley,
and I just have this feeling
that his eye has wandered.

02:29.992 --> 02:35.102
Would it be awfully horrible of me
to ask you to talk to him?

02:35.665 --> 02:39.924
Oh, I'll talk to him.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.786
Jerry!

03:31.524 --> 03:33.456
Brad! How are the kids?

03:33.491 --> 03:35.388
I don't have any kids.

03:35.423 --> 03:36.666
Great!

03:46.384 --> 03:47.711
Jerry!

03:48.007 --> 03:49.882
What a nice surprise!

03:49.917 --> 03:52.780
Alan! A pleasure.
What did you have for breakfast?

03:52.780 --> 03:56.142
Umm, English muffin.

03:57.115 --> 04:02.560
I see your behavior modification is going well.

04:02.595 --> 04:03.586
Oh, it is.

04:03.621 --> 04:06.680
I've been working very hard
to deal with my Asperger's syndrome.

04:06.680 --> 04:11.363
I've been learning to connect to people,
to make eye contact, to shake hands,

04:11.398 --> 04:14.214
to show an interest in them
even if I have none.

04:14.214 --> 04:16.697
A skill I never mastered.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.497
What brings you by, Jerry?

04:18.531 --> 04:23.348
Well, I'm a solo practitioner now,
mostly finance and bankruptcy,

04:23.383 --> 04:25.956
but my behavioral therapist suggested that

04:25.991 --> 04:30.780
I place myself in more
and varied social situations,

04:30.815 --> 04:35.930
so that I might better practice
my new social skills.

04:35.965 --> 04:41.046
So I got myself assigned
a trial from the courts.

04:41.192 --> 04:42.818
Congratulations!

04:42.853 --> 04:50.032
Only, now that I'm actually going
to try a case in a courtroom, it's, well…

04:50.761 --> 04:53.355
Alan, I'm a wreck!

04:54.378 --> 04:55.659
What's the case?

04:55.694 --> 04:56.941
Attempted murder.

04:56.942 --> 04:57.593
Jerry.

04:57.628 --> 04:58.749
Yes, it's daunting,

04:58.749 --> 05:01.783
but I know the Massachusetts
penal code backwards and forwards,

05:01.783 --> 05:05.643
procedure, rules of evidence,
objectionable conduct.

05:06.795 --> 05:12.386
Jerry, litigation is about
more than knowledge of the law.

05:12.421 --> 05:17.977
It's about confidence, and strategy,
cheap theatrics…

05:20.540 --> 05:25.571
Why don't I see if I can rearrange some things?

05:25.606 --> 05:28.086
Perhaps if you permit,

05:28.121 --> 05:30.415
I could join you as co-counsel?

05:30.450 --> 05:31.692
Bingo!

05:33.515 --> 05:37.542
I mean… that would be nice.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.211
Three years ago,

05:50.415 --> 05:53.367
I received my permanent resident card.

05:53.402 --> 05:57.697
It allowed me to bring my son,
Dembe, over from Senegal.

05:58.061 --> 05:59.990
He was here exactly one month,

06:00.025 --> 06:04.628
enrolled at Boston Community College
to study engineering.

06:04.663 --> 06:09.232
One night, a man approached him,
begging for a dollar.

06:09.267 --> 06:12.256
Dembe pulled out his wallet,

06:13.643 --> 06:15.671
and when he did,

06:15.706 --> 06:21.227
the man shot him in the face,
took his wallet and ran.

06:21.262 --> 06:27.832
He was caught, but the police used
an illegal search warrant,

06:27.867 --> 06:30.262
so the case was dismissed.

06:30.297 --> 06:33.970
The judge banged his gavel and that was it.

06:34.005 --> 06:35.293
It's unimaginable.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.367
Mr Mkeba is a bus driver.

06:37.402 --> 06:42.427
Route 48 Jackson Square Station
via Green Street and Stonybrook Stations.

06:42.462 --> 06:45.245
I drive the night shift.

06:46.291 --> 06:49.092
I recently pulled over on Green Street,

06:49.127 --> 06:54.667
opened my doors, and there he was.

06:55.182 --> 07:00.445
The man who murdered my son 3 years ago.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.311
He got on, paid his fare.

07:04.346 --> 07:08.142
He was 6 inches from my face.

07:09.064 --> 07:11.472
He didn't even notice me!

07:11.507 --> 07:13.574
At the next stop, I pulled over

07:13.609 --> 07:17.645
and it was as if my body took control of me.

07:18.147 --> 07:21.154
I picked up the club I keep under my seat.

07:21.189 --> 07:23.636
I walked down the aisle to him,

07:23.671 --> 07:26.597
and I said, “You know me!”

07:26.632 --> 07:31.622
And I began hitting him
as hard as I possibly could.

07:31.771 --> 07:34.100
I couldn't stop pounding him.

07:34.135 --> 07:38.025
It took four witnesses to pull him off.

07:39.054 --> 07:40.199
I see.

07:40.234 --> 07:43.734
I know what I did was wrong.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.045
I know that.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.082
But if I go to jail,

07:50.283 --> 07:54.831
I worry about my family back in Senegal.

08:06.123 --> 08:07.037
Oh…

08:07.072 --> 08:09.863
Uh… I was just going for the 2 percent.

08:09.898 --> 08:11.286
Ah, um…

08:16.611 --> 08:18.477
A lot of milk choices these days.

08:18.477 --> 08:19.701
Yeah.

08:20.248 --> 08:21.287
Have we met?

08:21.322 --> 08:24.988
Audrey Pugliese, paralegal transfer
from M&A.

08:25.023 --> 08:29.047
I… put a brownie in here this morning
and now it's…

08:29.082 --> 08:31.455
Oh, Denny probably took it.

08:31.490 --> 08:32.302
You're kidding me?

08:32.302 --> 08:34.323
No, he has some boundary issues.

08:34.325 --> 08:38.042
Your best bet is to hide it in the crisper.

08:38.077 --> 08:39.464
Thanks.

08:43.769 --> 08:45.534
See ya.

08:46.087 --> 08:47.952
See ya.

09:09.704 --> 09:13.957
He's not supposed to be pacing, Alan.
The judge normally sits.

09:13.992 --> 09:16.679
Some judges have their quirks,
Jerry. This is his.

09:16.679 --> 09:19.122
He runs a very busy courtroom.

09:19.304 --> 09:22.310
Ah, Mr Kupfer! Jerry, you're in luck.

09:22.345 --> 09:24.743
Mr Kupfer is my favorite opposing counsel.

09:24.743 --> 09:27.071
He's smart, eloquent, a pleasure to watch,

09:27.071 --> 09:30.107
and every time I go up against him,
he obligingly loses.

09:30.107 --> 09:33.109
You know, if the US really wanted
to torture detainees,

09:33.109 --> 09:35.154
they could sentence them to be you for a day.

09:35.154 --> 09:37.262
I imagine it's excruciating.

09:37.297 --> 09:39.045
You have no idea.

09:39.046 --> 09:44.664
Docket Number 4175, Commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs Ande Mkeba.

09:44.699 --> 09:46.980
The charge is attempted murder.

09:47.015 --> 09:48.372
How do you plead?

09:48.407 --> 09:53.565
Uh, Jerry Espenson for the defendant.
We plead…

09:53.600 --> 09:55.928
that is, um… not guilty… your honor.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.889
By reason of temporary insanity.

09:58.924 --> 09:59.649
Bail.

09:59.684 --> 10:02.147
The Commonwealth seeks remand.

10:03.866 --> 10:07.547
Your honor, the crime Mr Mkeba
is charged with committing was the result

10:07.547 --> 10:12.845
of a unique and volatile confluence
of events that is unlikely to occur again.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.552
I'm sorry, could you sit down, please?

10:16.566 --> 10:17.651
I beg your pardon?

10:17.686 --> 10:22.041
You're distracting not just to me,
but everyone, isn't he?

10:22.076 --> 10:23.118
Jerry?

10:23.153 --> 10:25.894
There is nothing in the constitution

10:25.929 --> 10:28.975
that says the judge has to sit
on his ass all day, Mr Espenson.

10:28.975 --> 10:32.616
Your honor, the defendant is a flight risk.
He has strong ties overseas.

10:32.616 --> 10:34.372
The man can't afford a flight,

10:34.372 --> 10:38.226
and the strong ties Mr Kupfer
refers to is Mr Mkeba's family,

10:38.261 --> 10:43.440
who will starve if Mr Mkeba is not allowed
to continue driving his bus.

10:43.475 --> 10:44.965
Oh, very well.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.939
Bail is set at $50,000.

10:48.318 --> 10:51.388
We'll have you out by the end of the day.

10:52.192 --> 10:53.825
I just got overwhelmed.

10:53.860 --> 10:57.007
Your first time can be emotional.

10:57.042 --> 10:59.919
We'll try not to let it happen again.

11:08.962 --> 11:11.674
I brought wine, cheese, and condoms.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.803
I thought we'd picnic.

11:14.209 --> 11:16.997
Missy came to my office today.

11:17.032 --> 11:19.347
Oh, so just the wine and cheese.

11:19.382 --> 11:21.593
She's fairly certain of two things.

11:21.628 --> 11:23.769
One, that you're having an affair,

11:23.804 --> 11:26.157
and two, that you're still married to her.

11:26.157 --> 11:28.079
A slight technicality.

11:28.114 --> 11:30.813
Look, Missy and I are done,
Shirl. I swear.

11:30.848 --> 11:34.587
However, it is possible that
Missy and I were not on the same page

11:34.587 --> 11:36.352
when I broke the news to her.

11:36.387 --> 11:38.117
And what did your page say?

11:38.152 --> 11:40.837
Missy, our marriage is over.
I see now that we've made a mistake.

11:40.837 --> 11:44.811
I think it's time to admit it and move on
and seek our happiness elsewhere.

11:44.811 --> 11:46.995
And what page is Missy on?

11:47.030 --> 11:49.228
Don't wait up. I'm going out with the guys.

11:49.228 --> 11:52.689
I should have known, Ivan. I know you.

11:52.724 --> 11:56.184
You laid the oldest line
in the married man's playbook on me,

11:56.184 --> 11:57.559
and I swallowed it.

11:57.594 --> 12:02.230
Look, Shirl, if you want to stab me
with your letter opener right now,

12:02.265 --> 12:04.297
that's how I'd prefer to go anyway.

12:04.297 --> 12:08.257
But know that I am going to tell her.
It's just not that easy.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.222
Ivan, tell her.

12:10.257 --> 12:10.863
And then…

12:10.898 --> 12:13.667
There is no then, Ivan.
We're only dealing in now.

12:13.667 --> 12:16.122
Tell her.

12:28.877 --> 12:31.000
He was driving the bus.

12:31.035 --> 12:33.088
Made another stop or two.

12:33.123 --> 12:36.179
Each time, he kept looking back at me.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.958
Then he put on the emergency lights
and pulled over.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.054
I thought there was
something wrong with the bus,

12:41.054 --> 12:43.587
but then he… he… he stands up,
gets right in my face

12:43.587 --> 12:46.085
and starts to beat the crap out of me
for no reason.

12:46.085 --> 12:47.427
Did he say anything to you?

12:47.427 --> 12:50.025
He said something like, “You killed my son”.
Something like that.

12:50.025 --> 12:51.917
I… I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

12:51.917 --> 12:55.179
And, uh… how did the defendant
appear to you at this time?

12:55.179 --> 12:57.073
Like he totally knew
what he was doing.

12:57.073 --> 12:58.794
Come on, he parked the bus,

12:58.829 --> 13:01.715
looked me right in the eye
and tried to kill me.

13:02.844 --> 13:05.820
Thank you. Nothing further.

13:14.979 --> 13:17.319
Jerry, it's your witness.

13:17.354 --> 13:18.952
You take this one.
I'll do the next one.

13:18.952 --> 13:21.685
This one's yours, Jerry.
You prepared for this.

13:21.685 --> 13:24.348
You are ready to stand up.
You can do this.

13:24.383 --> 13:25.797
Counselors.

13:25.832 --> 13:28.836
The suspense is killing me.

13:38.618 --> 13:42.103
Mr Armus, you just testified
you didn't know what my client meant

13:42.103 --> 13:44.569
when he accused you
of killing his son.

13:44.604 --> 13:47.460
That's not entirely true, is it?

13:47.781 --> 13:48.927
I don't know what you mean.

13:48.927 --> 13:50.004
Let me be very clear, then.

13:50.004 --> 13:51.990
You murdered Mr Mkeba's son, didn't you?

13:51.990 --> 13:52.335
No.

13:52.370 --> 13:52.788
Objection.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.782
You shot him in the face
to steal his wallet.

13:54.782 --> 13:54.914
Hey, I didn't do it.

13:54.914 --> 13:57.260
Your Honor, all charges were dropped.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.233
Mr Shore?

13:58.268 --> 14:00.375
It goes to insanity, your Honor.

14:00.376 --> 14:03.353
This man murdered Mr Mkeba's son
in cold blood.

14:03.388 --> 14:07.475
Anyone can understand why a father
goes into an uncontrollable rage

14:07.510 --> 14:10.027
when his son's murderer
steps onto his bus.

14:10.027 --> 14:12.485
Counsel, approach.

14:16.626 --> 14:21.017
Your Honor, Mr Shore knows full well
that the case against Mr Armus was thrown out…

14:21.017 --> 14:22.552
Because of a faulty warrant,

14:22.552 --> 14:25.068
and the incompetent twits
in your office couldn't fix it.

14:25.068 --> 14:27.256
Children, enough.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.410
Objection sustained.

14:29.445 --> 14:32.329
And no more games, Mr Shore.

14:32.811 --> 14:35.013
Step back.

14:36.825 --> 14:39.165
I like your shoes.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.506
Don't start, okay?

14:43.145 --> 14:45.403
Mr Armus, when my client grabbed you,

14:45.438 --> 14:47.714
how many people did it take
to pull him off?

14:47.714 --> 14:49.753
Yeah, like five or six guys at least.

14:49.753 --> 14:52.905
Five or six grown men
to pull one man off you.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.555
He was beating the crap out of me.
He wouldn't stop.

14:54.555 --> 14:56.172
As though he had completely lost control.

14:56.172 --> 14:58.301
Yeah, that's righ—

15:02.066 --> 15:07.051
I don't remember much after that.
I blacked out and they took me to the hospital.

15:10.219 --> 15:12.396
Nothing further.

15:19.443 --> 15:20.832
That was great.

15:20.867 --> 15:22.779
I'll do the next one.

15:23.286 --> 15:25.828
You will do the next one.

15:36.791 --> 15:38.378
Hey, Audrey!

15:38.413 --> 15:39.965
Hey, you!

15:40.752 --> 15:43.903
God, I'm so glad I got out of M&A.

15:43.938 --> 15:47.278
Criminal law is a lot more interesting.
There's so much more to learn.

15:47.278 --> 15:49.889
Yeah, I like it.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.505
Look, as a sort of welcome-to-the-department
type of thing,

15:53.505 --> 15:56.678
would you like to grab some dinner?

15:56.713 --> 15:57.294
Oh…

15:57.329 --> 15:59.405
It's just that I know
this little Basque place

15:59.405 --> 16:03.196
and they serve family-style
with long benches. It's a lot of fun.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.030
I would love that.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.196
I'll make a reservation for…

16:07.231 --> 16:08.400
Eight?

16:08.435 --> 16:09.118
Eight it is.

16:09.118 --> 16:11.095
Great. Sounds perfect.
I'll meet you there.

16:11.095 --> 16:15.551
And then afterwards, maybe we can
go back to my apartment.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.625
That sounds like a plan.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.567
We could review the penal code…

16:20.602 --> 16:23.474
Great. And I'll show you my vagina.

16:35.305 --> 16:37.186
You speak Italian, right?

16:37.221 --> 16:38.925
<i>Si. Parlo Italiano.</i>

16:38.960 --> 16:40.594
So let me ask you this.

16:40.629 --> 16:43.511
In Italian, does the word…

16:43.546 --> 16:46.393
Uh… vagina mean something else?

16:47.644 --> 16:48.684
Something else?

16:48.719 --> 16:49.513
You know.

16:49.514 --> 16:54.379
Could it have some meaning
other than… you know?

16:54.589 --> 17:00.881
Like, is it another term
for some sort of ancient seacraft?

17:01.724 --> 17:03.641
I asked out Audrey…

17:03.676 --> 17:05.523
The new paralegal?

17:05.559 --> 17:09.173
I'm surprised. You're usually so sensitive
to all the rules around here.

17:09.173 --> 17:12.752
Believe me, there was no sexual
harassment involved, at least on my part.

17:12.752 --> 17:16.799
But on her part, somebody
not as cool as me could write her up.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.727
What do you mean?

17:18.762 --> 17:20.585
She said yes,

17:20.619 --> 17:24.638
then she asked me if later
I wanted to see her…

17:25.108 --> 17:26.088
Seacraft.

17:26.123 --> 17:27.068
Uh huh.

17:27.069 --> 17:30.281
As a friend, who's also a girl,
I would really like to know.

17:30.281 --> 17:31.884
Would you ever say anything like that?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.205
Probably not.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.668
That's what I thought your answer would be.

17:35.668 --> 17:37.910
But I still like her.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.978
Brad, what Audrey said is a little odd,

17:39.978 --> 17:42.287
but if you really like her,
it's not a deal-breaker.

17:42.287 --> 17:44.542
It's just a word.

17:45.259 --> 17:50.060
So… anchors away.

18:05.739 --> 18:07.457
Missy…

18:08.014 --> 18:11.803
I spoke with Ivan
and he told me everything.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
I don't know what to say.

18:15.129 --> 18:17.360
You don't have to say anything,

18:17.395 --> 18:21.775
except maybe “you're welcome!”,
because I owe you a super huge thank you!

18:21.782 --> 18:22.492
You do?

18:22.527 --> 18:25.142
After I spoke with you, I spoke with Ivan.

18:25.143 --> 18:27.779
It turns out, I was just being a nervous bride.

18:27.779 --> 18:29.556
He's not having an affair.

18:29.591 --> 18:32.055
Ivan reassured me that everything is fine.

18:32.055 --> 18:33.515
Of course he did.

18:33.550 --> 18:38.112
The thing is, I have a tiny confession
to make. I know I shouldn't,

18:38.147 --> 18:42.244
but I still have a squinch of a doubt
when it comes to Ivan's fidelity.

18:42.244 --> 18:45.723
I just don't want to doubt him
for the rest of my life.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.978
You have such a clear mind.
What should I do?

18:52.638 --> 18:56.305
I think I may have an answer.

19:02.405 --> 19:03.839
Now, Mr Mkeba,

19:03.874 --> 19:06.111
how did you feel when you were
beating him with the club?

19:06.111 --> 19:07.574
No, you don't want to say that.

19:07.574 --> 19:13.013
So then I'll say, “How did you feel
during this… during this”.

19:13.014 --> 19:16.917
And, uh… that will elicit testimony that
he wasn't in control of his emotions

19:16.917 --> 19:18.404
and he couldn't determine
right from wrong,

19:18.404 --> 19:22.420
and therefore, not guilty by reason
of temporary insanity. Bingo!

19:22.455 --> 19:23.878
Oh, sorry.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.500
Only allowed eight ‘Bingos’ a day.

19:26.535 --> 19:28.171
You're well under your quota.

19:28.171 --> 19:31.333
It's always good to have a few
spare ‘Bingos’ in your back pocket.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.878
I felt a little stiff.

19:32.913 --> 19:35.714
Well, fortunately, a courtroom
is a rather formal place.

19:35.714 --> 19:39.312
The jury won't expect you
to be loose and casual.

19:39.347 --> 19:40.128
Good.

19:40.163 --> 19:43.481
Jerry, keep in mind that when
you're questioning the witness,

19:43.481 --> 19:45.905
you are in charge of what you're doing.

19:45.940 --> 19:48.770
If you need to take a moment
to gather your thoughts,

19:48.770 --> 19:49.992
take the moment.

19:50.027 --> 19:53.081
Don't ever feel rushed.

19:53.116 --> 19:54.534
Okay.

19:57.425 --> 19:59.886
Good morning, Mr Mkeba.

20:01.181 --> 20:04.491
Mr Mkeba, where are you from?

20:04.689 --> 20:05.346
Senegal.

20:05.381 --> 20:06.219
Senegal. Right.

20:06.219 --> 20:08.859
He may say the city
that he comes from, too.

20:08.886 --> 20:11.483
But whatever he says, I can deal with it.

20:21.866 --> 20:24.174
A post-nup?

20:24.209 --> 20:26.352
My idea. I'm clever.

20:26.387 --> 20:27.982
She gets my cigarette boat.

20:27.982 --> 20:28.898
Only if you cheat.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.727
My box at symphony, my season
tickets to the Crimson games.

20:31.727 --> 20:34.522
I went to Harvard. Does she
look like she went to Harvard?

20:34.522 --> 20:36.574
No, but with 80 percent
of your net worth,

20:36.574 --> 20:38.556
she'll be able to make
a sizeable endowment.

20:38.556 --> 20:41.910
Who knows? Maybe they'll rename
the Ivan Tiggs Theater

20:41.945 --> 20:46.442
The “Ivan Tiggs Can't Keep It
In His Pants Theater” has a nice ring to it.

20:46.477 --> 20:50.856
My golf membership.
My custom-made suits.

20:51.893 --> 20:54.608
So basically, if I screw around,
she gets my life.

20:54.608 --> 20:56.781
Not your whole life.

20:56.816 --> 20:58.955
Just the parts you love.

21:01.556 --> 21:04.482
So what do you love, Ivan?

21:04.750 --> 21:08.233
Maybe you should give it some thought.

21:11.391 --> 21:12.846
She keeps saying it.

21:12.881 --> 21:13.591
Excuse me?

21:13.626 --> 21:14.301
Audrey.

21:14.302 --> 21:16.115
We went out on Friday,
again on Saturday.

21:16.115 --> 21:18.097
We spent all Sunday morning together.

21:18.097 --> 21:21.817
We're supposed to see each other tonight.
And we're… you know…

21:21.836 --> 21:22.947
Having sex?

21:22.982 --> 21:24.555
Yes. It's great.

21:24.556 --> 21:26.027
Really great.

21:26.062 --> 21:28.838
But she keeps saying that word… a lot.

21:28.873 --> 21:29.730
As in…

21:29.765 --> 21:31.270
As in, oh boy!

21:31.305 --> 21:33.666
My “that” really feels good.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.201
Or wow, you sure know
your way around my “that”.

21:36.201 --> 21:38.186
At first, I thought,
“Maybe she just likes to talk dirty”.

21:38.186 --> 21:39.870
Maybe this is a lead-in
for something else.

21:39.870 --> 21:41.101
But there is no something else.

21:41.101 --> 21:45.220
It's just “that”, again,
and again, and again.

21:45.255 --> 21:47.276
Hmm…

21:47.781 --> 21:50.563
I think I need to end it.

21:57.518 --> 22:01.761
No matter how angry the rest
of the world is with the United States,

22:01.796 --> 22:05.643
it's still the place to come
for hope and opportunity.

22:05.678 --> 22:08.290
But no one told me this could happen.

22:08.325 --> 22:10.903
My boy was here exactly one month,

22:10.938 --> 22:12.760
and he was gunned down,

22:12.795 --> 22:15.726
killed like an animal by another animal.
That man, Armus.

22:15.726 --> 22:17.249
Objection.

22:17.284 --> 22:18.772
Sustained.

22:19.103 --> 22:20.763
Okey dokey.

22:21.177 --> 22:22.806
Now, Mr Mkeba,

22:22.841 --> 22:26.175
take us to the day of the incident.

22:27.990 --> 22:31.109
I stopped my bus,
and he came on board.

22:31.144 --> 22:34.194
This man who was guilty
of killing my son.

22:34.229 --> 22:37.001
Well, of course, he wasn't
actually found guilty.

22:37.001 --> 22:39.962
Umm, the case was thrown out.

22:39.997 --> 22:44.219
Umm, let's move on.

22:47.362 --> 22:49.515
Okay. What happened as…

22:49.550 --> 22:54.108
when… what happened next, exactly?

22:55.666 --> 22:58.188
When I saw him,

22:58.821 --> 23:00.657
I froze.

23:00.692 --> 23:02.666
My heart began to pound.

23:02.701 --> 23:04.605
And I couldn't breathe.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.468
And then I realized
what was happening.

23:08.667 --> 23:12.079
God had sent me this gift.

23:12.114 --> 23:14.337
It was a sign from God Himself.

23:14.372 --> 23:16.048
“A sign from God…”

23:16.049 --> 23:18.749
And then I let God take over.

23:18.784 --> 23:19.948
“God took over…”

23:19.949 --> 23:22.687
He… I… whatever you will call it

23:22.722 --> 23:26.669
began hitting Armus over and over,
beating him.

23:26.704 --> 23:29.439
No, well, uh, first you pulled over

23:29.474 --> 23:32.413
and got your club that you always
keep under your seat,
and then you started beating him.

23:32.413 --> 23:32.773
Jerry…

23:32.790 --> 23:33.515
I don't know. I…

23:33.515 --> 23:37.655
No… You explained to us the other day
exactly how you recognized him,

23:37.673 --> 23:41.349
and then you pulled the bus over,
and then you grabbed the club.

23:41.349 --> 23:42.846
Your Honor, may I confer with my colleague?

23:42.846 --> 23:45.528
No, I'm sorry, but if he perjures himself
on top of these other charges…

23:45.528 --> 23:46.009
Jerry!

23:46.044 --> 23:49.180
It will be much worse, because,
in fact, Mr Mkeba was only

23:49.180 --> 23:54.669
attacking Armus in revenge for
what Armus did to his son.

23:54.704 --> 23:57.399
Oh, no. Not revenge! Oh.

23:58.947 --> 24:01.846
I did not mean to say “revenge”.

24:06.926 --> 24:10.483
Your Honor, I would like a brief recess
to confer with co-counsel.

24:10.483 --> 24:13.343
Huh. No kidding.

24:14.421 --> 24:16.771
Well, it is late.

24:16.806 --> 24:19.614
Let us reconvene tomorrow.

24:23.888 --> 24:25.846
Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:25.881 --> 24:26.842
Jerry!

24:26.877 --> 24:27.803
I blow it.

24:27.804 --> 24:29.879
My first trial and I blow it.

24:29.914 --> 24:33.256
It was as if I could see the wrong words
coming out of my mouth,

24:33.256 --> 24:36.374
but then they were out
and I couldn't bring them back in.

24:36.374 --> 24:39.781
Jerry, the thing to remember is,
that a trial is a process.

24:39.781 --> 24:43.153
The jury's decision
almost never hinges on just one thing.

24:43.153 --> 24:47.267
I said our client took revenge
on the victim!

24:47.302 --> 24:48.762
And you shouldn't have, but you did.

24:48.762 --> 24:49.570
Oh, God!

24:49.605 --> 24:50.932
And we'll just have to deal with it.

24:50.932 --> 24:51.709
How?

24:51.710 --> 24:53.447
I don't know yet, Jerry,

24:53.482 --> 24:57.172
but I do know this.
The trial's not over.

25:00.062 --> 25:04.144
Have you ever been involved
in a case that was going this badly?

25:04.179 --> 25:06.675
I'll be very frank with you.

25:06.710 --> 25:11.416
I've never been involved in a case
that was going as badly as this one.

25:11.597 --> 25:15.179
Mr Espenson made a very big mistake,
didn't he?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.891
He did.

25:17.701 --> 25:21.491
Not only did Jerry make
an unfavorable impression on the jury,

25:21.526 --> 25:26.630
but his statement that you attacked
Mr Armus for revenge

25:26.665 --> 25:29.547
is something from which
we cannot recover.

25:29.582 --> 25:31.524
That bell cannot be unrung.

25:31.559 --> 25:37.164
You may pick the metaphor of your choice,
but in any event, we will lose.

25:37.199 --> 25:39.861
So what do we do now?

25:40.767 --> 25:44.258
I'm afraid we can't do anything.

25:44.472 --> 25:48.365
But, you could do something.

25:49.318 --> 25:51.599
You could run.

25:54.092 --> 25:56.263
Mr Mkeba.

25:56.823 --> 26:00.171
Whatever it was that caused you
to uproot yourself and your son

26:00.171 --> 26:03.484
to start a whole new life far away
from the rest of your family.

26:03.484 --> 26:06.141
Whatever it was that caused you to do that,

26:06.176 --> 26:13.364
how does it compare with spending
most of the rest of your life in jail?

26:13.399 --> 26:16.916
So, you are telling me to flee?

26:16.951 --> 26:21.184
As a member of the Massachusetts bar,
I could never advise you to do that.

26:21.184 --> 26:24.475
But I can advise that if you appear
in court tomorrow morning,

26:24.475 --> 26:31.224
you will most certainly be found guilty,
and they will take you away immediately.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.990
Mr Mkeba,

26:36.025 --> 26:38.086
I'm sorry,

26:38.121 --> 26:42.002
but a legal victory in this case
is no longer possible.

26:42.037 --> 26:49.270
The best that you can hope for
is to avoid another injustice.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.779
When you and I first got together,
my mother said,

27:00.814 --> 27:06.367
“Missy, my baby cat, he's had five wives
before you, which puts him on ding!”

27:06.402 --> 27:08.422
Fifth floor, “Philanderer Department”.

27:08.422 --> 27:10.963
But I reminded her that you and I met at church,

27:10.963 --> 27:14.055
where we both left the crooked path
to follow our saviour.

27:14.055 --> 27:14.592
Amen.

27:14.593 --> 27:17.516
Only those seeds of doubt
were planted in my mind

27:17.516 --> 27:22.195
and the only thing that brought me peace
was when Shirley suggested the post-nup.

27:22.195 --> 27:23.870
Bless her soul,

27:23.905 --> 27:26.592
but as you can see, sweetheart,

27:26.627 --> 27:29.258
the solution is no solution at all.

27:29.293 --> 27:31.889
It's simply created strife between us.

27:31.924 --> 27:35.454
Yes, now I can see that.

27:35.489 --> 27:36.900
I'm glad.

27:36.935 --> 27:38.502
And I have a solution.

27:38.537 --> 27:40.225
Which is?

27:40.226 --> 27:44.742
The only way to dive in and cast
our lots together is to do just that.

27:44.777 --> 27:48.270
I'm going to draw up a post-nup
of my own, Ivan Tiggs.

27:48.305 --> 27:49.963
I'm… not following.

27:49.998 --> 27:51.622
And it'll go like this.

27:51.623 --> 27:56.450
I, Missy Tiggs, hereby pledge to you
everything dear to me.

27:56.485 --> 28:00.529
My fully autographed album cover
of the original cast of “A Chorus Line,”

28:00.529 --> 28:04.538
my piece of the barricade that
accidentally broke off during Les Mis,

28:04.538 --> 28:09.709
and my limited edition Phantom mask.

28:09.744 --> 28:13.856
Of course, materially, my possessions
cannot begin to compete with yours, Ivan,

28:13.856 --> 28:16.800
but they are everything
I hold dear to my heart.

28:16.835 --> 28:19.998
That is, everything that isn't you.

28:20.033 --> 28:23.033
We live in such a horrible
jaded world these days.

28:23.066 --> 28:26.385
No one at all believes
in the happy ending anymore.

28:26.420 --> 28:29.720
But a big part of me believes
that love can be forever.

28:29.739 --> 28:32.352
That's why I love musicals.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.363
That's why I love you.

28:39.321 --> 28:41.734
I can't imagine ever breaking your heart.

28:41.734 --> 28:44.077
And I think that if you broke my heart,

28:44.112 --> 28:47.152
my life would be over.

28:47.608 --> 28:51.448
But you would never do that to me,
would you, Ivan?

28:56.954 --> 29:00.111
Not in a million years.

29:14.342 --> 29:15.397
Hi!

29:16.219 --> 29:18.118
Audrey.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.819
Are we still on for a late dinner?

29:20.819 --> 29:23.679
Hey, listen, about that.
I got slammed this afternoon.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.469
I gotta file this motion tomorrow morning.

29:26.504 --> 29:27.984
I don't think it's going to happen tonight.

29:27.984 --> 29:30.229
Oh, that's okay.
We can reschedule, maybe tomorrow.

29:30.229 --> 29:33.157
Tomorrow, I've got basketball, and then
my parents are visiting for the weekend.

29:33.157 --> 29:35.797
I'll tell you what, I'll call you next week.

29:35.803 --> 29:38.563
We're going set something up for next weekend.

29:38.619 --> 29:41.855
No, we're not, are we?

29:42.627 --> 29:45.088
No, we're not.

29:45.590 --> 29:48.543
Can I ask what happened?

29:50.635 --> 29:55.304
You keep using the “V” word,
and it creeps me out.

29:55.339 --> 29:56.259
You mean “vagin…?”

29:56.259 --> 29:57.666
Yes, yes.

29:57.667 --> 29:59.960
What is it that you don't like exactly?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.397
The word or the item?

30:02.432 --> 30:04.957
I love the item.
I can't get enough of the item.

30:04.957 --> 30:07.251
It's just the word.
It sounds kind of clinical.

30:07.251 --> 30:10.420
You don't hear it very often
outside the classroom.

30:10.455 --> 30:13.589
I can't believe this.
You guys talk about your uh…

30:13.624 --> 30:15.356
equipment all the time.

30:15.391 --> 30:16.576
Okay. First of all, I don't.

30:16.576 --> 30:19.562
And second of all, we have
many clever names for it.

30:19.562 --> 30:22.513
Exactly. You have, like,
four thousand names for it!

30:22.513 --> 30:25.261
But, God forbid, I say ”vagina“, and…

30:25.296 --> 30:26.657
Did… did you just flinch?

30:26.657 --> 30:27.937
No!

30:28.504 --> 30:29.460
Fine.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.888
You don't have to go out with me.

30:31.923 --> 30:34.373
Grow up!

30:38.895 --> 30:41.398
You're the one who said it!

30:51.386 --> 30:55.268
Well, your Honor, this may be
an all-time low, even for Mr Shore…

30:55.268 --> 30:57.566
Your Honor, our client is missing.

30:57.601 --> 30:59.969
We should be worrying about his safety,

31:00.004 --> 31:03.269
not constructing wild theories
about his disappearance.

31:03.269 --> 31:06.886
Oh, please. You knew you were losing,
you told him to run and he ran.

31:06.886 --> 31:09.184
At the risk of forfeiting the bail we posted?

31:09.184 --> 31:10.688
Don't be preposterous!

31:10.723 --> 31:14.505
We had no reason whatsoever
to tell Mr Mkeba to run away.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.773
The facts are on our side,
the jury loves me,

31:17.808 --> 31:20.972
and they find Mr Espenson
quirky and endearing.

31:21.007 --> 31:25.909
No, the only one with a motive to make
Mr Mkeba disappear is you, Mr Kupfer.

31:25.944 --> 31:28.025
What have you done with him?

31:28.060 --> 31:28.284
Your Honor…

31:28.284 --> 31:29.515
Mr Kupfer,

31:29.550 --> 31:34.072
do you have any evidence
that Mr Shore is hiding Mr Mkeba?

31:34.107 --> 31:35.519
Not yet.

31:35.554 --> 31:38.908
Hmm, the police will continue
to search for Mr Mkeba,

31:38.943 --> 31:42.263
an international warrant
will be issued for his arrest,

31:42.298 --> 31:46.979
and until such time as Mr Mkeba shows up again,

31:47.014 --> 31:49.421
this case is adjourned.

31:49.456 --> 31:53.447
No, now everybody, just get out.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.663
Perhaps you and I should go
look for him ourselves.

31:58.663 --> 32:01.291
Wouldn't it be fun to ride
around Boston together?

32:01.291 --> 32:03.154
We could pack sandwiches.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.761
You know, Al, my only fear is that

32:05.796 --> 32:09.439
somebody is gonna stab you
before I get a chance to take you down.

32:09.439 --> 32:11.256
Odds are, you're right.

32:11.291 --> 32:13.545
It's been a pleasure, Mr Kupfer.

32:13.580 --> 32:16.354
How'bout them Celtics?

33:13.163 --> 33:16.084
I can't break her heart, Shirl.

33:16.591 --> 33:19.917
Sure you can. You do it all the time.

33:19.952 --> 33:21.279
True.

33:21.314 --> 33:24.718
Actually, I blame the system.
Why can't a man love two women at once?

33:24.718 --> 33:27.288
Or ten or fifteen.

33:27.738 --> 33:31.332
Ivan, let's not waste any more
of each other's time.

33:31.367 --> 33:35.834
I knew this was over the moment
Missy skipped into my office last week.

33:35.869 --> 33:40.073
And, while we're being honest,
at least I am,

33:40.108 --> 33:45.940
while we were together, I knew eventually,
it would be… something.

33:45.975 --> 33:49.020
No one ever really has Ivan Tiggs.

33:49.055 --> 33:50.978
Also true.

33:51.644 --> 33:54.523
You're still my best friend, though.

33:54.888 --> 33:57.635
Am I yours?

33:57.993 --> 34:00.846
I need to look at the way
I've been defining my friends.

34:00.846 --> 34:03.812
For now, no.

34:04.937 --> 34:08.607
Sure know how to break a guy's heart.

34:08.641 --> 34:11.708
I can be cruel that way.

34:13.096 --> 34:18.650
You do understand what signing
this document means, don't you?

34:18.686 --> 34:20.379
I do.

34:20.414 --> 34:23.645
Let's face it. None of us trusts me.

34:23.679 --> 34:28.188
This way I won't come knocking
at your door unless I mean it.

34:29.422 --> 34:35.429
Of course, if I sign it,

34:35.464 --> 34:39.725
you and I are going to have
to be really careful.

34:40.725 --> 34:44.114
Oh, that poor girl.

34:50.053 --> 34:51.801
Hey, Audrey?

34:51.835 --> 34:53.329
What do you want, Brad?

34:53.364 --> 34:54.688
Listen, about before…

34:54.723 --> 34:56.047
I kind of acted like a…

34:56.047 --> 34:57.404
I know… the word.

34:57.439 --> 34:58.726
Well, I can say it.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.975
I wanted you to know, I get it.

35:01.010 --> 35:03.346
It's probably just some male-female thing.

35:03.346 --> 35:05.832
We men aren't used to women
discussing their anatomy so freely.

35:05.832 --> 35:09.853
I'm sure women feel the same way
when men discuss their…

35:09.888 --> 35:11.231
anatomy.

35:11.266 --> 35:15.095
What I'm trying to say is, I would
really like to go out with you again.

35:15.095 --> 35:17.457
I don't know why I reacted the way I did.

35:17.457 --> 35:19.893
It's just a word, right?

35:19.928 --> 35:21.768
Say it.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.650
I'm thinking it.

35:27.663 --> 35:29.184
All right.

35:29.469 --> 35:31.920
Vagina!

35:44.500 --> 35:47.586
They haven't found Mr Mkeba.

35:48.192 --> 35:50.670
They'll let us know if they do.

35:52.366 --> 35:57.773
I would never ask you directly if you had
anything to do with his going away.

35:57.808 --> 36:01.279
That's because you're an excellent attorney, Jerry.

36:01.314 --> 36:03.543
There's no doubt in my mind

36:03.578 --> 36:07.154
that you could develop into a
first-rate criminal defender, Jerry,

36:07.154 --> 36:09.485
but my hope is that you don't.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.667
Even at your relatively mature age,

36:12.702 --> 36:16.225
you're… still innocent.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.293
Except for when I held a knife
to Shirley's throat.

36:19.293 --> 36:21.157
Other than that.

36:21.529 --> 36:25.132
There's a reason Shakespeare,
and many after him, said,

36:25.167 --> 36:28.412
“First, kill all the lawyers”.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.581
They're talking about people like me, Jerry.

36:31.616 --> 36:33.765
Not you.

36:38.865 --> 36:41.658
I am excellent at banking and finance.

36:41.693 --> 36:43.750
You are indeed.

36:46.524 --> 36:48.753
Thank you, Alan.

36:53.084 --> 36:56.669
It's been a pleasure,
and enjoy the rest of your day.

36:56.704 --> 36:59.295
Goodbye, Jerry.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.045
Thank you, Shirley, for everything.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.372
Oh, it was a pleasure.

37:47.372 --> 37:49.627
Ivan, always good doing business with you.

37:49.627 --> 37:51.456
Yes, it is.

37:52.976 --> 37:54.269
So, honey, shall we go?

37:54.269 --> 37:57.768
You go on ahead.
I'll be there in a minute.

38:13.356 --> 38:15.415
I want to thank you, Shirley.

38:15.450 --> 38:17.502
It… it was nothing.

38:17.537 --> 38:19.554
No, it was everything.

38:20.290 --> 38:24.016
When I came to you, I did it because
I knew you were a woman of principle.

38:24.016 --> 38:26.836
And you didn't let me down.
You did the right thing.

38:26.836 --> 38:29.455
And now, from this day forward,

38:29.456 --> 38:32.006
I know my Ivan won't cheat on me…

38:32.041 --> 38:35.405
with anyone.

39:00.576 --> 39:03.759
Nothing worse than
having your heart crushed

39:03.794 --> 39:06.943
and your pride stung
all in the same day.

39:06.978 --> 39:11.575
My God, we have the fastest
water cooler in town.

39:13.190 --> 39:14.731
I feel like such a fool.

39:14.766 --> 39:17.490
Ah, forget it.

39:17.663 --> 39:21.562
If anybody knows anything about
being a fool, it's Denny Crane.

39:21.597 --> 39:26.478
My advice? Get some mortar and brick
and wall it up.

39:27.312 --> 39:30.314
Does that mean you're back on the market?

39:30.349 --> 39:34.375
Denny, as far as you're concerned,
I'm always on the market.

39:34.410 --> 39:35.635
You see?

39:35.670 --> 39:39.530
That's how you get us, all of us men,
even Denny Crane.

39:39.565 --> 39:42.969
We know we don't deserve Shirley Schmidt,

39:43.004 --> 39:47.661
but just the possibility
is enough to sustain us.

39:47.696 --> 39:50.505
You are a dear, sweet man.

39:50.540 --> 39:55.031
And I have something else
that might sustain you.

39:55.247 --> 39:57.331
Denny Crane!

40:10.539 --> 40:12.822
I hear you misplaced a client.

40:12.857 --> 40:14.175
Not really.

40:14.210 --> 40:18.877
Like car keys and sunglasses,
he'll show up somewhere.

40:19.081 --> 40:20.933
I misplaced a client once.

40:20.968 --> 40:22.751
Did they ever find him?

40:22.786 --> 40:28.078
No, I made sure to ship him off
to some country with no extradition.

40:28.113 --> 40:30.766
A practically deserted island off
of South America.

40:30.766 --> 40:33.384
He sends me Felice Cupleanos cards
once a year.

40:33.384 --> 40:34.410
That's thoughtful.

40:34.410 --> 40:35.480
Yeah.

40:35.515 --> 40:39.206
Sounds like paradise,
actually living on an island.

40:39.241 --> 40:40.706
A much simpler life.

40:40.741 --> 40:45.071
Especially if it's an island where
the natives run around on the beach

40:45.106 --> 40:46.689
with their boobies hanging out.

40:46.689 --> 40:48.269
Yes.

40:48.941 --> 40:53.240
But I was thinking on a much more elemental level.

40:53.275 --> 40:57.665
A place where my biggest concern
would be carrying water on my shoulders

40:57.700 --> 41:04.355
or where the simple act of thatching a roof
would dissipate the voices in my head.

41:04.390 --> 41:06.397
And the hardest choice you have to make is

41:06.397 --> 41:09.268
what you're going to have for lunch.

41:09.303 --> 41:12.139
What did you have for lunch today?

41:16.129 --> 41:19.389
Flounder. You?

41:19.424 --> 41:22.978
Steak sandwich, onion rings.

41:24.383 --> 41:27.752
Alan, you know, one thing you sometimes forget

41:27.787 --> 41:31.593
is no matter how hard your day,
no matter how tough your choices,

41:31.593 --> 41:33.850
how complex your ethical decisions,

41:33.885 --> 41:41.450
you always get to choose
what you want for lunch.

41:41.773 --> 41:48.327
Daily, I am amazed at your
inexhaustible ability to just live.

41:48.957 --> 41:51.678
It's either that or die.
