00:46.130 --> 00:50.300
Help! Help me!

00:58.275 --> 01:00.644
Can anybody hear me?

01:00.678 --> 01:02.847
Oh. Hey!

01:04.782 --> 01:06.751
Help! Help!

01:10.188 --> 01:11.656
Oh, my God.

01:15.793 --> 01:17.795
Help! Hey!

01:17.829 --> 01:19.396
Hey, hey, help me!

01:19.429 --> 01:22.700
Hey, help me! In the car!
Help! Ahhh!

01:27.038 --> 01:29.272
- Are you okay?
- Can you please take me to the police?

01:29.306 --> 01:30.574
Of course. Get in.

01:38.149 --> 01:39.951
What happened to you?

01:42.720 --> 01:43.955
They're dead.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.958
They're all dead.

02:06.144 --> 02:10.547

Whoa! What's your problem?

03:02.365 --> 03:04.669
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk!

03:04.702 --> 03:07.905
Oh, you're just out here
watching your schoolyard crush?

03:07.939 --> 03:10.407
Dylan, you look ridiculous!

03:10.440 --> 03:12.043
Good neighbors here.

03:15.512 --> 03:16.881
Just go inside.

03:17.949 --> 03:20.117
- Don't track water in my house.
- Right.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.086
Clean up your room.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.689
Company coming over.

03:38.501 --> 03:41.839
Hey, dinner with Reverend
Charles tonight at 7:00.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.341
Okay? Don't forget.

03:43.373 --> 03:44.641
I kinda already have plans
for tonight.

03:44.675 --> 03:46.509
Well, you're kinda gonna
have to break you plans.

03:46.543 --> 03:48.212
It's my house, my rules.
If you don't like,

03:48.246 --> 03:49.914
you'll be 18 soon,
and you could leave.

03:49.947 --> 03:52.817
- Why you gotta be like that?
- Why do you have an attitude all the time?

03:52.850 --> 03:56.754
Look, just... change.
Dress nicer.

03:56.787 --> 03:58.488
You don't always have to look
so homeless.

04:53.978 --> 04:56.814
Hmm. Okay.

05:00.351 --> 05:02.086
Dude, are you serious?

05:07.825 --> 05:11.228
Having some people over tonight,
if you're interested.

05:12.296 --> 05:13.931
I can't.

05:13.965 --> 05:17.001
I got this... This dinner thing
with my mom.

05:17.034 --> 05:20.204
What? Fine, suit yourself.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.572
She's tryin' to impress some guy
that she's been dating.

05:22.605 --> 05:24.809
Impress?

05:24.842 --> 05:27.945
Your mom's hot as fuck.
Why would she even want you there?

05:29.013 --> 05:31.082
I don't know.

05:31.115 --> 05:34.185
I guess to pretend that we're
a halfway decent family.

05:34.218 --> 05:37.655
- Mmm-hmm.
- The dude's like a reverend or something.

05:37.688 --> 05:39.991
- A reverend?
- Yeah.

05:40.024 --> 05:42.693
Your mom and a reverend?

05:42.727 --> 05:44.862
It's like sacrilegious.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.864
I guess that she thinks

05:46.897 --> 05:49.734
it's the quickest way
to get good with God.

05:50.935 --> 05:54.205
It kind of is.

06:36.747 --> 06:38.082
Mmm.

06:38.115 --> 06:42.119
- Dorothy, you have truly outdone yourself.
- Oh.

06:42.153 --> 06:45.823
And I'm not just talking
about the dinner either.

06:45.856 --> 06:48.659
Charles.

06:48.692 --> 06:52.463
Dylan, your mother tells me
you'll be graduating soon.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.365
Yeah, in about a week.

06:54.398 --> 06:56.767
Very good, son.
So you'll be looking

06:56.801 --> 06:58.102
for a place of your own
pretty soon.

06:58.135 --> 07:01.205
Actually, we started
looking at colleges for Dylan.

07:01.238 --> 07:04.607
- We have?
- Yeah, we have.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.844
Oh.

07:06.877 --> 07:09.747
Weren't you
expelled from two other schools?

07:09.780 --> 07:12.582
I left those schools...
by choice.

07:12.615 --> 07:14.118
Yeah, he wasn't a good fit.

07:14.151 --> 07:17.121
Then I'm sure you have plenty
of other options lined up.

07:22.426 --> 07:23.661
May I be excused?

07:23.694 --> 07:25.029
No, we're in the middle
of dinner.

07:25.062 --> 07:26.730
Please, I have somewhere
I need to be.

07:26.764 --> 07:28.365
Where do you have to go,
to get drunk with Nick?

07:28.399 --> 07:30.134
- I don't drink.
- Right.

07:30.167 --> 07:32.536
He doesn't drink, but he was passed out
drunk on the back lawn this morning,

07:32.570 --> 07:34.205
because he doesn't drink.

07:34.238 --> 07:36.707
It told you, it... It was a nice night.
I just thought I would enjoy it.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.608
I fell asleep.

07:38.641 --> 07:40.643
That is such
a dumb excuse, son.

07:40.678 --> 07:43.581
Hey, stop calling me "Son."
You don't know me.

07:43.613 --> 07:47.251
And you watch your tone
with me, young man.

07:47.284 --> 07:48.752
You know,
when I was your age,

07:48.786 --> 07:51.021
I was a man.
I wasn't leeching of my mama.

07:51.055 --> 07:53.290
But you don't have a problem
leeching off of mine?

07:53.324 --> 07:56.127
Sit down. Sit down!

07:57.128 --> 07:58.229
Dylan.

08:00.965 --> 08:03.901
You wanna know
why I don't drink?

08:03.934 --> 08:07.004
Oh, yeah. Please enlighten us.

08:07.037 --> 08:09.406
Shall I describe
my childhood to you?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.609
I mean, you were there...

08:11.641 --> 08:13.177
but maybe
you just don't remember.

08:13.210 --> 08:16.180
You know, you've got
a real attitude problem.

08:16.213 --> 08:19.283
What can I say?
Things weren't always roses at home.

08:19.316 --> 08:20.684
You wanna go?

08:22.319 --> 08:23.387
Get out.

08:24.955 --> 08:25.990
Get out!

08:31.395 --> 08:32.897
Shit. Dylan...

08:38.235 --> 08:41.337
I'm so sorry, Charles.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.084
Hey, I'll see you guys
inside, right?

09:22.980 --> 09:25.716
Tex, you thinking of getting out
after graduating this year?

09:25.749 --> 09:27.117
Hey, Tex.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.921
I ain't in no rush.

09:30.955 --> 09:32.957
Hey, third time's
a charm, right?

09:32.990 --> 09:35.926
- You want a beer?
- No, no, no. I don't...

09:36.827 --> 09:38.829
All right, yeah. Fuck it.

09:38.862 --> 09:41.131
Attaboy, Dylan.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.134
- I'll see you around.
- All right.

09:44.802 --> 09:46.237
Where were we?

09:47.037 --> 09:48.272
Excuse me.

09:48.305 --> 09:50.074
Hey, yo, what's up, Nick?

09:50.107 --> 09:52.843
Yo! Look who decided
to show.

09:52.876 --> 09:55.145
Yeah, man,
my schedule freed up. Hey.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.947
Hey!

09:56.981 --> 09:58.449
How was the reverend?

09:58.482 --> 10:01.785
I don't wanna talk about that
right now, actually.

10:01.819 --> 10:03.954
- Okay.
- Hey, Dylan. Yo, Dylan!

10:03.988 --> 10:05.823
But I will be back.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.259
Excuse me.
Hey, what's up, Monty?

10:08.292 --> 10:11.562
- He's always a little weird.
- I need shots.

10:11.595 --> 10:12.731
- You want shots?
- Yeah.

10:12.763 --> 10:14.198
My God.

10:14.231 --> 10:16.767
Shots!

10:20.004 --> 10:21.972
Fuck yeah,
I love to party!

10:31.382 --> 10:33.250
It's been a while.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.386
Yeah. Yeah, I bet.

10:35.419 --> 10:38.422
You gonna stick around
for a while at the party?

10:38.455 --> 10:40.958
I don't know yet.

10:40.991 --> 10:44.028
Don't leave without
saying goodbye, all right?

10:44.061 --> 10:46.163
I have something to tell you.

10:52.469 --> 10:55.906
What is wrong with you?
That's Sara Holland, man.

10:55.939 --> 10:58.275
I know who it is, Monty.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.877
Are we still on
for ball tomorrow?

10:59.910 --> 11:02.846
Don't tell Nick how it is.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.582
- Yeah, man, I got you.
- All right.

11:20.898 --> 11:23.067
So you're drinking now.

11:24.034 --> 11:27.104
Still only my second.
Maybe... my third.

11:27.137 --> 11:29.406
Mmm-hmm.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.811
I always thought it was kinda
cool that you didn't drink.

11:32.843 --> 11:34.845
I just felt like it.

11:34.878 --> 11:36.213
What's it to you?

11:37.448 --> 11:38.615
Nothing.

11:39.383 --> 11:40.517
I'm sorry.

11:45.757 --> 11:47.458
Oh, my God.

11:47.491 --> 11:49.460
It was yesterday, wasn't it?

11:52.363 --> 11:54.331
Yeah. Three years.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.202
And I guess that me...

11:58.235 --> 12:00.637
...and my mom have different
ways of dealing with that.

12:01.972 --> 12:05.008
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

12:05.576 --> 12:08.412
No. No, it's okay.

12:08.445 --> 12:11.949
I mean... it has
nothing to do with you, so...

12:11.982 --> 12:14.151
Yeah, it does.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.621
Dylan, you're... my friend.

12:17.655 --> 12:20.090
You're my oldest
and best friend.

12:22.292 --> 12:25.697
And...
I'm gonna miss you so much

12:25.730 --> 12:27.665
...next year.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.304
But... I might have something
to make you feel better.

12:36.206 --> 12:38.142
And what would that be?

12:41.612 --> 12:42.680
- Come on.
- Really?

12:42.714 --> 12:44.081
Yeah, I'm serious.

12:44.648 --> 12:46.216
- Come on.
- All right.

12:52.289 --> 12:54.692
Gosh, we were so little
when we came up with that.

12:59.898 --> 13:01.999
She's trash.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.435
Yeah, she'll be gone, too.

13:04.468 --> 13:05.969
- Sara.
- Good.

13:29.426 --> 13:30.461
Whoa.

13:31.896 --> 13:34.431
- Guess who?
- What's going on?

13:41.271 --> 13:45.108
For old times.
One last ride.

13:46.945 --> 13:49.446
<i>♪ I'm so extra</i>

- What's your problem?
- I can't. I gotta go.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.080
- Dylan.
- I gotta get out of this place.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.050
Why do you always have to be
such a pussy?

14:44.903 --> 14:46.838
- Hey, what's up, Rahem?
- There he is.

14:46.871 --> 14:49.339
Hey, how about changin' it up
a little bit and buyin' some?

14:49.373 --> 14:51.910
Uh, you know what? Lemme think about that.
I'll be in my office.

14:51.943 --> 14:54.846
You need to think about school,
and ain't like those punks around town.

14:54.879 --> 14:57.782
Don't worry about me.
I've got my whole future planned out.

14:57.815 --> 14:59.851
Yes, so did I.

15:15.465 --> 15:17.669
Come on, come on, come on.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.391
You're pretty good, kid.

15:41.425 --> 15:43.393
Obviously not good enough.

15:43.427 --> 15:49.067
Hmm. I have not seen
one of these in years.

15:49.099 --> 15:52.036
Yeah? Lemme stand up
and tell them.

15:52.070 --> 15:54.571
Is that right? Huh.

15:56.306 --> 16:00.210
Is this what you, uh,
do for kicks... around here?

16:00.243 --> 16:01.879
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

16:01.913 --> 16:03.848
Yeah?

16:03.881 --> 16:08.452
- Well... don't go dying.
- What?

16:09.353 --> 16:13.223
The game. Don't die.
See you around.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.334
- Rough night?
- Screw you, Casey.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.404
Looks like you're the
one getting screwed tonight.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.978
- No. No!
- Mmm. Oh, God.

17:07.011 --> 17:09.279
Don't go there.

17:09.311 --> 17:10.547
Hello?

17:10.579 --> 17:12.950
- Oh, my God.
- That's every scary movie.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.690
- What's up, kids?
- Uh, hey... Hey, officers.

17:18.723 --> 17:21.858
- What's up?
- Just seeing who's doing what.

17:21.893 --> 17:24.695
Yeah. Yeah... Um,
but we didn't have a party.

17:24.729 --> 17:26.897
We just had
some people over earlier.

17:26.931 --> 17:28.933
Really?

17:28.966 --> 17:30.735
Dad's out of town again, huh?

17:30.768 --> 17:32.269
Mmm. When isn't he?

17:34.138 --> 17:36.140
Tex, I thought we got you

17:36.174 --> 17:38.241
- on drunk and disorderly last week.
- Uh-huh.

17:38.275 --> 17:41.045
What're you doing here?

17:41.079 --> 17:43.848
Well, I mean, you know,
Officers, it's graduation week.

17:43.881 --> 17:46.117
Judge just let me slide.

17:46.150 --> 17:49.619
Gee, you guys must be so bored
comin' all the way out here.

17:49.654 --> 17:52.156
You have no idea.

17:52.190 --> 17:54.859
Okay, then, um... Hey!

17:54.892 --> 17:57.427
Uh, why don't I...

18:00.597 --> 18:01.598
For the road.

18:01.631 --> 18:05.069
- Why, thank you, Nick.
- See you next week.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.404
- Graduation party.
- Be safe.

18:07.437 --> 18:10.440
See you next week.

18:12.309 --> 18:14.277
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

18:16.781 --> 18:18.482
What'd I miss?

18:18.515 --> 18:21.384
I think they're...
I think they're aliens.

18:21.418 --> 18:23.755
- What?
- Yeah.

18:23.788 --> 18:24.922
No.

18:24.956 --> 18:26.657
Why are there always aliens?

18:42.673 --> 18:46.244
<i>♪ You don't know how it feels</i>

18:46.276 --> 18:48.612
<i>♪ To be me</i>

18:51.414 --> 18:56.386
<i>♪ Oh, baby
you don't know how it feels</i>

18:56.419 --> 18:58.588
<i>♪ To be me</i>

20:09.794 --> 20:10.895
Okay.

20:17.969 --> 20:18.970
Shit!

20:33.150 --> 20:36.721
Guys! Guys, help!

20:41.192 --> 20:43.426
What...
What you got there, man?

20:43.460 --> 20:45.629
I found her on the street.

20:45.663 --> 20:47.131
Can you put her back?

20:47.164 --> 20:49.466
Really, Sara?

20:49.499 --> 20:52.303
Shit.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.705
Come on. Come on.

21:07.952 --> 21:09.486
Hmm.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.949
What's this?

21:37.982 --> 21:40.751
Video kid. This his?

21:40.785 --> 21:44.322
How would I know?
All these punks come in here.

21:44.355 --> 21:47.692
I'll ask you again.
Is it his?

21:47.725 --> 21:49.526
Rahem.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.063
I don't know.
He likes this stuff.

21:52.096 --> 21:55.498
Would you be so kind as to point
me in his direction, Rahem?

21:56.434 --> 21:57.902
I don't know where he is.

21:57.935 --> 22:01.772
He comes in, he plays his game,
and then he leaves, I swear.

22:04.675 --> 22:09.246
Rahem, I don't like
to repeat myself.

22:11.148 --> 22:13.516
I, uh...

22:15.019 --> 22:19.390
Uh... Rahem.

22:19.423 --> 22:22.426
Come on, Rahem.

22:22.460 --> 22:25.363
Rahem. Come on, Rahem.

22:25.396 --> 22:29.033
Come on. Come on, Rahem.

22:29.066 --> 22:31.802
Why do you keep saying
my name so much?

22:37.808 --> 22:40.244
Oh, they won't protect you.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.612
They just show you
what happened.

22:46.417 --> 22:47.752
Rahem...

22:49.053 --> 22:50.287
Rahem...

23:05.069 --> 23:07.071
Sheesh, she looks
just like...

23:07.104 --> 23:08.873
- Just like...
- Is that... Is that her?

23:08.906 --> 23:10.540
I... I don't know
who she is.

23:10.573 --> 23:12.743
No way. She's all torn up.
Just look at her.

23:12.777 --> 23:14.879
Yeah, she looks
pretty rough.

23:24.121 --> 23:26.157
What...
What are you doing?

23:26.190 --> 23:28.392
Nothing. Nothing.

23:28.426 --> 23:30.761
Dylan found you
on the street.

23:30.795 --> 23:34.298
You found me
on the street?

23:39.136 --> 23:41.205
Why did you bring me here?

23:41.238 --> 23:43.908
My phone died,
and this was the closest house.

23:43.941 --> 23:45.743
I mean, you were pretty beat-up,
so I just...

23:45.776 --> 23:47.211
Who the fuck are you?

23:53.951 --> 23:57.121
I was in an accident,
I think.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.590
Yeah, that's fine.

24:00.623 --> 24:02.259
We're gonna call 911 now,
right?

24:02.293 --> 24:04.195
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'll call 911.

24:04.228 --> 24:08.365
No, no, no, no. Don't...
Don't call the cops.

24:08.399 --> 24:10.401
I can't
have them... I...

24:10.434 --> 24:12.670
Are you in trouble
with the law?

24:12.703 --> 24:15.339
Because none of us have
seen you around here before.

24:15.372 --> 24:17.842
No, no, no.
I... I crashed my car.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.377
Please don't tell anyone.

24:20.411 --> 24:23.581
I don't wanna be
in trouble with the cops.

24:23.613 --> 24:26.150
Okay. Okay,
we won't say anything.

24:26.183 --> 24:28.919
Just stay calm, all right?
I promise you're safe.

24:28.953 --> 24:32.723
Someone's obviously off their fuckin' meds.
I'm outta here.

24:35.459 --> 24:38.596
Okay. Um... are you hurt?

24:38.628 --> 24:40.531
What about a hospital?

24:40.564 --> 24:43.234
I'm... I'm fine.

24:44.368 --> 24:46.170
I'm just tired.

24:48.172 --> 24:50.808
Can I... Can I just stay here
for a bit?

24:50.841 --> 24:54.345
I... I'll call someone
to pick me up, I promise.

24:54.378 --> 24:55.379
Okay.

24:56.780 --> 25:00.151
Hey, guys,
could you please leave?

25:00.718 --> 25:02.052
Give her some space?

25:04.421 --> 25:06.524
This is my room.

25:06.557 --> 25:07.992
Uh, no.

25:08.459 --> 25:11.996
Really? Out.

25:12.029 --> 25:14.131
All of this was interesting
for a little bit...

25:14.165 --> 25:16.867
- but now, it's just kinda sad and boring.
- Yeah.

25:17.635 --> 25:18.836
Thanks, guys.

25:21.172 --> 25:23.274
Hey. Hey.

25:23.307 --> 25:25.009
It's okay.

25:25.042 --> 25:27.378
I'm gonna grab some stuff
to clean you up, okay?

25:27.411 --> 25:30.714
You're gonna be fine. Promise.
I'll be right back.

25:36.053 --> 25:37.054
Hey.

25:38.889 --> 25:41.158
Thanks for helping me out.

25:41.192 --> 25:44.728
Yeah, I mean, you tackled me off my board.
I didn't really have a choice.

25:46.230 --> 25:47.431
My name's Dylan.

25:48.532 --> 25:49.900
I owe you one.

25:49.934 --> 25:52.203
No. No, no, you don't owe me.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.739
It was just
the right thing to do.

26:13.824 --> 26:15.492
This might sting a little.

26:19.396 --> 26:22.266
Has anyone ever told you
you look like Bebe A. Love?

26:37.381 --> 26:38.882
- Whoo.
- Oh.

26:42.721 --> 26:45.756
Well, now!

26:45.789 --> 26:47.858
That's a hell of a shame.

26:47.891 --> 26:50.461
- Well, this thing was goin' pretty fast, huh?
- Mmm.

26:50.494 --> 26:51.996
Tennessee plates.
Davidson County.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.330
It's out of Nashville.

26:53.364 --> 26:55.933
Pretty nice car
to be all the way up here.

26:55.966 --> 26:57.635
It's probably stolen,
I'm guessing.

26:57.669 --> 27:00.739
- That's what I think.
- Jesus Christ! Put your hands on your head, sir.

27:00.804 --> 27:03.540
Uh...
What did I do, officers?

27:03.574 --> 27:06.610
You're out here creepin' in the dark.
That's what.

27:06.644 --> 27:11.282
Well, the vehicle is out here in the dark.

27:12.616 --> 27:13.884
What now?

27:13.917 --> 27:16.186
You asked why I'm
creepin' around in the dark.

27:16.220 --> 27:19.023
Well, I can't help it.
It's just dark.

27:19.056 --> 27:22.359
Sir, do you know
who owns this car?

27:22.393 --> 27:25.796
Oh, no, I can't reveal that.
Privacy reasons, I'm sure you understand.

27:25.829 --> 27:27.998
What are you,
some type of a dick?

27:28.032 --> 27:31.703
More of a security detail.
My name is Anton.

27:31.736 --> 27:33.137
"Anton"?

27:33.170 --> 27:35.172
Look, if we walk
over to my car,

27:35.205 --> 27:38.275
I can call my boss and see if
I can share the client's name.

27:38.309 --> 27:41.545
Simple. My phones
are in the car.

27:42.346 --> 27:44.081
Let's give him a shot.

27:44.114 --> 27:45.382
Oh. Oh!

27:45.883 --> 27:47.251
Mmm.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.889
Right.

27:51.922 --> 27:54.693
Yes, yes. I see.

27:54.726 --> 27:55.959
Okay.

27:57.796 --> 27:59.296
Okay, guys...

28:01.999 --> 28:05.737
this is a very complicated
and delicate matter.

28:05.770 --> 28:10.107
The person that we are looking
for is actually quite famous.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.343
Famous?

28:13.377 --> 28:14.645
Around here?

28:14.679 --> 28:16.980
World-famous
and passing through.

28:17.014 --> 28:19.784
The reason I've been trying to
be so discreet about this...

28:19.818 --> 28:22.920
Well, she's not doing so well.

28:22.953 --> 28:24.555
You know, I'm...
I'm still not following you.

28:24.588 --> 28:27.692
You're... You're saying
that this famous person

28:27.726 --> 28:29.193
was the one behind the wheel?

28:29.226 --> 28:31.830
The past couple of weeks
she's been a few Xanaxes shy

28:31.862 --> 28:34.865
of shaving her head and attacking
someone with an umbrella.

28:34.898 --> 28:37.968
Do you know what I mean?
She's not well.

28:38.001 --> 28:42.272
Well, I look out for her.
I'm a handler of sorts.

28:42.306 --> 28:43.708
Well,
the suspense is killing me.

28:43.742 --> 28:45.677
You gonna tell us who she is, or what...

28:45.710 --> 28:47.277
What the fuck was that?

28:47.311 --> 28:50.815
Honestly, you don't wanna know.

28:50.849 --> 28:52.416
Open the fuckin' trunk.

28:52.449 --> 28:56.855
I can assure you that is the last
thing that you want to happen.

28:56.887 --> 28:59.423
Open the fuckin' trunk now!

29:02.092 --> 29:05.929
- Slowly.
- Just tryin' to help.

29:07.898 --> 29:09.667
Go.

29:17.207 --> 29:18.676
Oh.

29:18.710 --> 29:22.146
Lord Almighty. Jeb. Jeb.

29:22.179 --> 29:24.548
Now, down on
the fucking ground.

29:38.228 --> 29:40.665
Nobody ever listens anymore.

29:45.870 --> 29:47.604
So, let me
get this straight.

29:47.638 --> 29:52.242
You were riding your board,
and this random chick just jumped at you?

29:52.276 --> 29:55.112
Yeah, man. I don't
know where she came from.

29:55.145 --> 29:57.816
- It was random.
- And you didn't see anything else?

29:57.849 --> 30:00.417
- Like another car or a person?
- No.

30:00.451 --> 30:01.786
Nothing. It was clear.

30:01.820 --> 30:03.454
So weird, man.

30:03.487 --> 30:07.191
This is so lame. Let's just call
the cops and let them figure it out.

30:07.224 --> 30:10.160
Just give her a minute, okay?
She's scared.

30:10.194 --> 30:13.997
Guys, I... I think it's her.

30:14.031 --> 30:16.266
I don't know. I...
I mean, I do.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.535
Oh, please.
That's ridiculous.

30:18.569 --> 30:20.905
What would anybody famous
be doing here anyway?

30:20.939 --> 30:22.439
It's fun
to think about it,

30:22.473 --> 30:24.541
- but come on, guys.
- Okay, calm down. Calm down.

30:24.575 --> 30:28.579
She's definitely just a crackhead
that just looks like Bebe.

30:28.612 --> 30:30.280
And now that
she's in my bed,

30:30.314 --> 30:32.149
can we please do something
about it?

30:32.182 --> 30:34.251
Look, I don't mind helping anybody.
I really don't.

30:34.284 --> 30:37.154
But, uh, I got
a scholarship come fall.

30:37.187 --> 30:39.289
Now, I can't be getting mixed up
in anything weird.

30:39.323 --> 30:43.160
Okay. Look, whoever she is,
she... She got in an accident.

30:43.193 --> 30:44.829
Okay. That's it. That's all.

30:44.863 --> 30:46.029
Damn it.

30:47.097 --> 30:50.000
Look, man, I'm fine
with whatever you wanna do.

30:50.033 --> 30:52.704
But we gotta do something.

30:52.737 --> 30:54.806
I don't care
who she looks like.

30:54.839 --> 30:56.540
Yeah, you're right.

31:00.611 --> 31:01.713
- Whoa!
- Oh, fuck.

31:02.646 --> 31:03.748
Oh, shit.

31:10.053 --> 31:11.890
This place is a mess.

31:11.923 --> 31:13.023
Can we clean up?

31:13.056 --> 31:14.959
- Yeah, yeah, I guess...
- Yeah.

31:14.993 --> 31:16.527
Yeah.

34:07.999 --> 34:09.266
Fuck this.

34:18.676 --> 34:19.811
What the hell?

34:23.246 --> 34:24.982
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

34:25.016 --> 34:28.753
Hey, I'm at 515 Terry Street, and we
found someone who was in an accident.

34:28.786 --> 34:30.587
Can you send he...

34:30.620 --> 34:32.857
- Piece of shit.
- Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

34:32.889 --> 34:34.192
Stop it.

34:34.224 --> 34:35.726
Why did you just do that?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.195
She is not our problem.

34:37.226 --> 34:39.664
Well then, why don't you
just leave?

34:39.697 --> 34:42.100
I don't have a car
and you know that.

34:42.132 --> 34:44.802
Well, Tex is sober by now.
So go with him.

34:44.835 --> 34:46.003
Fuck you, Nick.

34:51.809 --> 34:56.279
<i>Car 29,
we have a 911 for 55 Terry Street.</i>

34:56.313 --> 34:58.348
<i>I believe
that's the Hill's Residence.</i>

34:58.381 --> 35:00.317
<i>They said they found
a car accident victim.</i>

35:03.221 --> 35:05.690
Well, copy that.
We are on our way.

35:26.778 --> 35:27.979
Sorry.

35:28.012 --> 35:29.981
No, it's okay. I just...

35:30.014 --> 35:32.415
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

35:33.684 --> 35:34.819
Appreciate that.

35:40.423 --> 35:42.193
Do you need anything?

35:42.226 --> 35:43.694
Water, or...

35:46.264 --> 35:47.531
Okay.

35:54.705 --> 35:57.675
Are you from
around here or... something?

35:59.309 --> 36:01.444
Uh, it's just
a few hours away.

36:02.479 --> 36:04.015
Nashville, right?

36:04.849 --> 36:06.316
What?

36:06.349 --> 36:08.552
Th... The show tonight.
Casey's right.

36:08.585 --> 36:11.454
- No. You have me mixed up with...
- No. No.

36:12.723 --> 36:13.758
No, it is you.

36:17.028 --> 36:19.329
Shit. You're Bebe A. Love.

36:19.362 --> 36:20.630
I... I love your music. I...

36:20.665 --> 36:22.733
I mean, I really listen to you.
I love you.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.404
Sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean that. I just...

36:29.140 --> 36:30.675
Dylan, please...

36:30.708 --> 36:32.910
You... You can't say anything.

36:32.944 --> 36:36.613
Not even to your friends.
No one can know that I'm here.

36:37.380 --> 36:39.116
If the media found out...

36:40.617 --> 36:43.754
Please promise me. No one.

36:45.022 --> 36:46.623
Bebe A. Love.

36:48.558 --> 36:51.662
Yeah... I don't understand
why you're here.

36:54.131 --> 36:55.398
I don't know.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.737
Uh, when I got done
with my show...

37:01.239 --> 37:04.608
I saw this car
with keys in it, and...

37:05.109 --> 37:06.376
I took it.

37:07.377 --> 37:08.880
I started driving.

37:09.814 --> 37:10.982
Away from it all.

37:12.549 --> 37:15.686
I have never driven a car
in my entire life.

37:18.488 --> 37:20.791
I guess, I just needed
to get away.

37:20.825 --> 37:25.863
Nick's... Nick's dad is gonna
be away for a while, so...

37:25.897 --> 37:29.466
If... If you want,
you can stay.

37:29.499 --> 37:30.567
No, I'll...

37:30.600 --> 37:32.970
call my lawyer
and take care of it.

37:34.839 --> 37:36.974
There are people
who are angry at me.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.176
And looking for me.

37:43.948 --> 37:44.982
Dylan...

37:45.816 --> 37:49.287
no one can know
that I'm here.

37:51.155 --> 37:52.723
Hey, uh, um...

37:53.891 --> 37:56.426
Yo, Dylan, can I, um...
Can I talk to you for a minute?

37:58.296 --> 37:59.562
Like, now.

38:02.033 --> 38:03.034
Please.

38:09.273 --> 38:11.142
Okay, look, um,
I'll come back.

38:11.175 --> 38:12.944
Just... You should
get some rest.

38:32.930 --> 38:34.597
Sara called
the cops, man.

38:34.631 --> 38:37.134
She's freaking out
about everything.

38:37.168 --> 38:38.535
Fuck.

38:38.568 --> 38:40.805
Okay, maybe we can find a way
to make them go away.

38:40.838 --> 38:43.140
Maybe she's right.
Maybe we should call the cops.

38:56.954 --> 38:58.022
Hey.

38:58.488 --> 38:59.690
Who's that?

39:07.898 --> 39:08.933
I don't know.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.015
C... Can I help you?

39:24.882 --> 39:26.684
You can help me.

39:26.717 --> 39:29.586
Uh, okay.

39:30.755 --> 39:31.822
Okay.

39:33.590 --> 39:36.427
Where's Officers Roberts
and Mills?

39:36.460 --> 39:38.696
As you can see,
they've escorted me here.

39:38.729 --> 39:41.531
I'll be handling
the situation.

39:41.564 --> 39:43.734
Okay, well, you wouldn't mind
if I spoke to them?

39:43.768 --> 39:45.369
I do mind, actually.

39:45.403 --> 39:47.304
I'm really in quite a rush.

39:48.973 --> 39:51.976
You give off
such a creepy vibe.

39:52.009 --> 39:53.110
Just an FYI.

39:53.144 --> 39:54.445
Why, thank you.

39:54.478 --> 39:59.283
Now, you seem like
somewhat of a smart guy.

39:59.316 --> 40:02.953
I bet you know
why I'm here.

40:03.454 --> 40:05.456
Do you have a badge?

40:05.489 --> 40:07.691
Or a name or something
that I can see?

40:07.725 --> 40:12.129
If you could just bring her
down, that would be swell.

40:12.163 --> 40:13.630
The crackhead?

40:13.664 --> 40:17.168
- You want the... The crackhead?
- Crackhead.

40:17.201 --> 40:19.236
Crackhead.

40:19.270 --> 40:20.337
That's funny.

40:21.105 --> 40:22.807
Hey, there you are.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.142
How about that? I've been
looking for you.

40:26.310 --> 40:28.312
The video kid. Come here.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.648
What'd you want with her?

40:31.682 --> 40:35.052
Oh, looks like
someone's in the know.

40:35.953 --> 40:37.788
You. Beat it.

40:37.822 --> 40:40.157
Back off, okay. Shoo!

40:40.191 --> 40:41.192
Beat it.

40:43.294 --> 40:44.995
Deal with it.

40:47.198 --> 40:48.199
Your name?

40:48.799 --> 40:50.868
Uh, Dylan.

40:50.901 --> 40:51.902
Dylan.

40:52.470 --> 40:53.971
Dylan.

40:54.004 --> 40:57.607
Well, Dylan, it's not very hard
to see how this all played out.

40:57.640 --> 41:00.845
And I understand that you're
just trying to do right by her.

41:00.878 --> 41:05.249
But she is a sick girl.

41:06.183 --> 41:07.284
And needs help.

41:07.318 --> 41:10.221
Think about it, Dylan.
Running around out there,

41:10.254 --> 41:12.156
crying for help.

41:12.189 --> 41:16.060
Doesn't take much to see
that she is not well.

41:16.594 --> 41:17.828
And who are you?

41:17.862 --> 41:19.897
Well, we haven't
properly met.

41:19.930 --> 41:21.432
I'm Anton.

41:21.465 --> 41:23.000
Would you invite me in?

41:23.033 --> 41:24.902
It'd be easy
if you said yes.

41:27.304 --> 41:30.808
You are not safe...

41:31.442 --> 41:32.510
with her in there.

41:33.643 --> 41:35.246
None of you.

41:35.279 --> 41:37.114
None of you.

41:37.148 --> 41:40.818
And I can't be held responsible
for her actions.

41:40.851 --> 41:44.522
Now, I truly prefer
not to have to walk in here

41:44.555 --> 41:46.624
and physically drag her out.

41:46.657 --> 41:49.160
So, Dylan, my man...

41:49.193 --> 41:53.230
Dylan, if you could just calmly
talk her down to me,

41:53.264 --> 41:54.865
and I can take it from here,

41:54.899 --> 41:58.302
and everything will be
so simple, Dylan.

41:59.937 --> 42:02.239
Do it, Dylan.

42:04.108 --> 42:05.075
Do it.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.351
Don't shut me out!

42:16.220 --> 42:17.388
Don't shut me out!

42:21.225 --> 42:22.726
What was that?

42:22.760 --> 42:24.695
I don't know.

42:24.728 --> 42:27.898
- Wind. Was it the wind?
- Yeah, it's totally wind.

42:28.966 --> 42:31.769
Don't shut me out!

42:32.102 --> 42:33.337
Damn it!

42:33.370 --> 42:36.941
Don't shut me out!

42:38.876 --> 42:41.812
Are you ready for a show?

42:41.845 --> 42:45.282
Are you ready
for the show?

42:46.651 --> 42:48.819
Behind door number one...

42:48.852 --> 42:52.523
is... Come here, dead buddy.

42:52.556 --> 42:54.959
And number two.

42:57.828 --> 43:00.898
Are you enjoying
the show, everyone?

43:01.432 --> 43:02.733
Good.

43:03.668 --> 43:04.935
Ah!

43:07.104 --> 43:08.872
I need to get out
of here, now.

43:08.906 --> 43:10.541
Sara, Sara, come here.
Calm down.

43:10.574 --> 43:14.345
- This can't be real, right?
- This looks pretty fucking real to me, Nick!

43:15.446 --> 43:17.848
Come on! Come on!

43:18.249 --> 43:20.918
God damn it!

43:20.951 --> 43:24.288
- Dylan!
- Everybody, lock everything, now!

43:26.257 --> 43:27.491
There's a man outside
looking for you.

43:27.524 --> 43:29.393
He says
he's your manager or something.

43:29.426 --> 43:31.028
He just killed two cops.

43:31.061 --> 43:32.029
He's here.

43:32.062 --> 43:34.265
If he's the man outside,
then yeah, he's here.

43:37.101 --> 43:38.869
You need to tell me
what's going on.

43:38.902 --> 43:41.205
He came back for me.

43:41.238 --> 43:42.840
He is coming for me.

43:42.873 --> 43:44.441
I'm not going back!

43:44.475 --> 43:45.809
Back? Where?

43:45.843 --> 43:47.578
This was no good either.

43:47.611 --> 43:48.812
Fuck.

43:51.482 --> 43:54.485
Guys, we're just sitting ducks.
We can't just stay here.

43:54.518 --> 43:56.220
Yeah, well, it looks like
he's not trying to break in.

43:56.253 --> 43:57.821
He's just circling the house
like a shark.

43:57.855 --> 44:00.692
We have to get out.
Get out. Get out.

44:00.725 --> 44:02.359
God damn it,
it's a no brainer, y'all.

44:02.393 --> 44:05.029
We go up there, grab her,
toss her ass out of here.

44:05.062 --> 44:06.731
- Yeah, why don't we give him what he wants.
- Yeah.

44:06.765 --> 44:09.768
Get out!
Please, get out!

44:09.800 --> 44:11.869
Get out!

44:12.369 --> 44:13.237
What is going on?

44:13.270 --> 44:14.673
It's not
an earthquake, is it?

44:14.706 --> 44:15.873
No, the floors
ain't moving, man.

44:29.286 --> 44:31.088
- Sara! Sara!
- Wait, wait! Don't, don't, don't!

44:31.121 --> 44:33.324
If she wants to go, that's on
her, but it's not safe outside.

44:33.357 --> 44:35.125
- Come back!
- No, stop! Sara!

44:36.960 --> 44:38.562
We can't get through
to anybody.

44:38.595 --> 44:40.264
The phones aren't working.

44:40.297 --> 44:42.767
All right. Okay, okay.
Guys, guys, what... What do we do?

44:42.801 --> 44:43.967
Nick, do you have
any guns?

44:44.001 --> 44:46.103
Uh, yeah, yeah, I got a gun,
it's in the safe.

44:46.136 --> 44:47.604
But I don't know
what the fucking code is.

44:47.638 --> 44:48.839
Oh, my God.

44:48.872 --> 44:50.874
Dylan, what did you
bring to my house, man?

44:50.908 --> 44:52.109
She needed my help, man.

44:52.142 --> 44:54.178
Well, this is on you.
So fix it.

44:54.211 --> 44:57.348
- Dude.
- Nick, it's not his fault.

44:57.381 --> 44:59.049
- Fuck!
- God!

45:41.826 --> 45:43.728
I'm sorry, Dylan.

45:43.762 --> 45:46.163
Listen, some weird shit
is going on.

45:47.665 --> 45:49.199
I'm freaking out, too.

45:50.769 --> 45:52.035
Look...

45:54.171 --> 45:56.407
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

45:57.709 --> 45:58.942
Please.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.445
Oh.

46:02.479 --> 46:04.181
Look, I'm sorry, but...

46:04.214 --> 46:05.215
Please.

46:06.651 --> 46:09.586
You can't send me out there.

46:09.620 --> 46:11.823
And I... I can't...
You don't know what it's like.

46:11.856 --> 46:14.692
Look, I have to look out
for my friends.

46:14.726 --> 46:17.662
Okay? That guy out there
killed people that we know.

46:17.695 --> 46:20.164
And with everything that's
going on in the house, it's...

46:23.033 --> 46:25.068
Look...

46:25.670 --> 46:26.738
Please don't get angry.

46:26.771 --> 46:29.206
I don't want you
to get angry, but...

46:31.676 --> 46:33.010
you have to leave.

46:33.878 --> 46:35.145
Please.

46:36.781 --> 46:38.048
Truth is...

46:41.719 --> 46:43.153
I don't know...

46:43.688 --> 46:45.189
what I am.

46:47.090 --> 46:48.559
There, there, now.

46:49.526 --> 46:51.995
No reason to be afraid.

46:54.064 --> 46:56.901
I, too, was just taking
a little breather

46:56.935 --> 46:59.671
from the hustle and bustle.

47:01.505 --> 47:02.506
Sit.

47:06.945 --> 47:08.212
Go on.

47:09.313 --> 47:10.547
I'm sorry.

47:14.518 --> 47:16.053
For what? You...

47:16.553 --> 47:19.056
didn't do anything.

47:19.089 --> 47:21.124
Please don't hurt me.

47:21.158 --> 47:23.427
That's not my style.

47:25.095 --> 47:28.031
Uh, I have no reason
to hurt you.

47:28.867 --> 47:30.467
In fact, I...

47:31.703 --> 47:33.270
kind of admire you.

47:33.872 --> 47:35.639
Why?

47:37.207 --> 47:41.478
Because you believe
in self first.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.449
Not much else...

47:46.450 --> 47:47.719
matters.

47:50.822 --> 47:52.556
Would you do me a favor?

47:59.731 --> 48:03.500
I need you to come closer.
It's a secret, don't be afraid.

48:06.503 --> 48:08.305
Yes. Yes, now.

48:22.687 --> 48:25.188
Fuck this waiting around.
We should make a run for it.

48:25.222 --> 48:26.523
No, no, don't be stupid.

48:26.557 --> 48:29.192
All he wants is the girl.
Dylan's gonna talk her down,

48:29.226 --> 48:30.929
we're gonna push her
right out the door,

48:30.962 --> 48:32.396
and nobody has to get hurt.

48:32.429 --> 48:36.166
Okay. But, God,
how do you explain the falling glass,

48:36.199 --> 48:39.202
- and the slamming doors...
- Can we just deal with one thing at a time?

48:40.571 --> 48:42.840
- Let me in.
- What happened?

48:44.341 --> 48:46.076
Guys, I think he's gone.

48:46.109 --> 48:48.713
- Okay, guys, if he's gone, we have to make a run for it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

48:48.746 --> 48:50.715
- Okay. I'm so sick of these games.
- No, no, no, no, wait.

48:50.748 --> 48:51.916
It could be a trap.

48:51.950 --> 48:55.285
Like, let her come back,
tell us that everything's okay.

48:55.319 --> 48:56.854
Let's just wait for Dylan.

48:56.888 --> 48:58.188
I don't know.

49:00.992 --> 49:03.226
Ever since
I was a little girl...

49:04.361 --> 49:07.899
stuff just happened
around me.

49:07.932 --> 49:10.200
Stuff that I can't explain.

49:15.238 --> 49:17.274
You don't know
about the guy outside?

49:17.809 --> 49:19.010
Anton?

49:19.043 --> 49:22.212
Why doesn't he just come inside
and get you? He's just...

49:22.245 --> 49:25.016
I... I don't know.
I don't know.

49:25.049 --> 49:27.819
I... I think he is afraid
of me or something.

49:28.251 --> 49:30.054
There are rules.

49:30.088 --> 49:31.521
It's a business.

49:33.858 --> 49:35.592
One they would murder for.

49:35.626 --> 49:36.627
They?

49:37.729 --> 49:38.896
My handlers.

49:40.765 --> 49:41.899
My father.

49:47.304 --> 49:48.940
Where the hell is Dylan?

49:48.973 --> 49:50.908
Just give him
a minute, Nick.

49:53.644 --> 49:54.746
Dylan.

49:58.181 --> 49:59.817
Are you scared of me?

50:02.486 --> 50:03.487
Yeah.

50:05.622 --> 50:07.157
Yeah, I'm petrified.

50:26.778 --> 50:28.780
I'm not gonna hurt you.

50:56.573 --> 50:58.810
Hey, hey, hey! It's just me.

50:58.843 --> 50:59.877
It's just me.

51:08.485 --> 51:10.520
I don't like
this shit, dude.

51:10.554 --> 51:12.190
Nick, do you think
that he cut the power?

51:12.222 --> 51:14.992
Will you stop asking me questions
like I fucking know the answer, Tex?

51:15.026 --> 51:16.560
I'm just as scared
as you are.

51:16.593 --> 51:19.563
There is a back-up
generator underneath the house.

51:19.596 --> 51:20.998
What if he breaks in
when you are gone?

51:21.032 --> 51:22.900
Don't you think he
would have broken in by now?

51:22.934 --> 51:24.534
He's just screwing with us.

51:26.369 --> 51:27.571
I'll be right back.

51:27.604 --> 51:29.107
- Wait.
- I'm coming with you.

51:29.140 --> 51:31.909
Guys.
Be careful, please.

51:31.943 --> 51:35.445
- I... I should go check on them.
- No, no, don't go.

51:35.479 --> 51:38.049
I... I've never been on my own before.
I don't know what to do.

51:38.082 --> 51:39.649
You just stay up here.

51:39.684 --> 51:41.886
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- I'm sorry...

51:43.286 --> 51:45.455
that I got you
involved in this.

51:47.390 --> 51:49.292
You do believe me,
don't you, Dylan?

51:50.427 --> 51:51.763
Do I have a choice?

52:12.516 --> 52:14.685
She's such a bitch.

52:17.221 --> 52:20.390
I came back
for you guys.

52:21.659 --> 52:23.326
Such a bitch.

52:34.504 --> 52:35.973
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:36.007 --> 52:37.241
Where were you?

52:37.275 --> 52:39.442
Just trying to figure
all this out.

52:39.476 --> 52:41.078
Did you make her leave?

52:43.247 --> 52:44.447
Dylan.

52:47.985 --> 52:50.353
Jesus!

52:50.387 --> 52:54.125
It's okay. There's a lot of critters down here.

52:54.158 --> 52:55.860
I hate critters.

52:59.263 --> 53:00.898
Oh, shit. There it is.

53:00.932 --> 53:03.234
Okay. Um...

53:03.267 --> 53:05.770
- Check the gas.
- I'm trying to.

53:06.536 --> 53:08.105
Where are they?

53:09.140 --> 53:11.108
They should've made it
back by now.

53:11.142 --> 53:12.409
Monty.

53:13.343 --> 53:15.579
How come you never made
a move on me?

53:15.612 --> 53:16.613
What?

53:17.982 --> 53:21.285
I said, how come
you never made a move on me?

53:21.319 --> 53:22.586
It's kind of
a strange time

53:22.619 --> 53:25.723
to have a conversation
like this, don't you think?

53:25.756 --> 53:29.260
Look, I'm just trying to keep
my mind off things.

53:29.293 --> 53:30.828
I'm really scared.

53:31.461 --> 53:34.165
Well, I'm scared, too.

53:34.198 --> 53:36.399
I mean, yeah, I've...
I've definitely thought about you.

53:36.433 --> 53:37.634
You're beautiful.

53:39.170 --> 53:41.072
You really wanna
get our mind off things?

53:41.973 --> 53:43.074
What do you mean?

53:44.208 --> 53:46.844
I just want all this
to be over with.

54:25.349 --> 54:26.918
Good work. I like it.

54:29.854 --> 54:30.855
Oh!

54:38.296 --> 54:40.865
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

54:41.766 --> 54:44.201
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

54:44.235 --> 54:46.404
- I... I just walked in.
- Monty, please, come on.

54:46.436 --> 54:47.738
- Come on, Monty.
- I was in the bathroom.

54:47.772 --> 54:49.874
- Who did this?
- How the fuck should I know?

54:49.907 --> 54:51.842
Because you have blood
all over you.

54:51.876 --> 54:53.911
I was trying to help him,
just like you.

54:53.945 --> 54:55.545
It must have been him.

54:57.181 --> 54:58.349
No! No!

54:58.382 --> 55:00.318
How did this happen?

55:00.351 --> 55:02.153
We don't know.
We just found him like this.

55:02.186 --> 55:04.487
I'm gonna kill
that motherfucker!

55:04.521 --> 55:06.257
Was everything locked?

55:06.290 --> 55:07.692
Yeah, yeah.
I... I think so.

55:07.725 --> 55:10.593
Well, if everything's locked,
how the fuck did he get in?

55:10.627 --> 55:13.530
I can't take this anymore!

55:14.332 --> 55:16.033
- She's gone.
- Whoa, whoa, big guy.

55:16.067 --> 55:18.402
This is messed up, but I was just
with her upstairs. She didn't do this.

55:18.436 --> 55:20.237
I don't care, Dylan. Move!

55:20.271 --> 55:21.872
Please, Tex, stop!
Please, Tex!

55:21.906 --> 55:24.909
Stop! Stop! Okay,
let's just think about this for a minute!

55:24.942 --> 55:25.910
It's fucking her!

55:25.943 --> 55:27.477
Okay, it's her.
It's Bebe A. Love.

55:27.510 --> 55:29.080
What?

55:29.113 --> 55:31.648
- I know, I should've told you guys...
- That's bullshit.

55:31.682 --> 55:34.285
- He's lying.
- Why would I? It's fucking her!

55:34.318 --> 55:36.486
Why wouldn't you
tell us that?

55:36.519 --> 55:38.555
Do you realize
what insane shit we're in now?

55:38.588 --> 55:40.557
Because I promised her.

55:40.590 --> 55:42.860
We're your
fucking friends, Dylan.

55:42.893 --> 55:44.929
When... When shit
was bad for you,

55:44.962 --> 55:46.964
we... We... get it.

55:46.998 --> 55:48.833
- You know what, I don't give a shit.
- Tex.

55:48.866 --> 55:51.501
- Tex. Tex, stop.
- Who or what she is, okay?

55:51.534 --> 55:52.703
We're past that, Dylan!

55:52.737 --> 55:53.804
- Get out of my way!
- Tex.

55:53.838 --> 55:55.906
- Wait, guys! Guys!
- Tex!

55:58.541 --> 55:59.744
Tex, stop!

55:59.777 --> 56:00.978
Tex, no!

56:07.018 --> 56:08.652
Whose side are you on?

56:08.686 --> 56:10.654
Just calm down!

56:25.535 --> 56:27.138
Bebe, open the door.

56:28.072 --> 56:28.906
Bebe, please!

56:30.607 --> 56:32.542
- Tex! Tex, you okay, man?
- Yeah, he's okay.

56:32.575 --> 56:37.048
- Dylan, come out here.
- I can't. The door is locked.

56:37.081 --> 56:40.017
Hold on, Dylan. I'm gonna get
something to pry open the door with.

56:41.152 --> 56:43.287
Damn it!

56:43.320 --> 56:45.189
Shit.

56:54.465 --> 56:55.866
Oh, fuck!

57:43.114 --> 57:44.248
Bebe.

57:45.449 --> 57:46.750
Bebe.

57:54.125 --> 57:55.226
Sweetie.

57:56.360 --> 57:58.095
Let's go home.

57:59.163 --> 58:00.431
Enough is enough.

58:00.464 --> 58:02.967
It's only a matter of time
before they start to turn on you.

58:04.268 --> 58:05.436
Please.

58:05.469 --> 58:07.771
Let's go home.

59:05.162 --> 59:08.232
Oh, God. Oh, God, come on.
Get off.

59:14.371 --> 59:15.906
What are you doing in here?

59:15.940 --> 59:17.474
I have to wash
the blood off, too.

59:17.508 --> 59:20.344
Why couldn't you just
use the other bathroom?

59:20.377 --> 59:22.012
It's the same blood.

59:22.046 --> 59:24.415
I thought we should
wash it off together.

59:25.916 --> 59:28.118
- You okay, Sara?
- Why?

59:28.687 --> 59:30.087
Don't I look okay?

59:36.961 --> 59:39.396
I'm so sorry
to wake you.

59:42.199 --> 59:44.635
I didn't think
it would come this far.

59:48.772 --> 59:52.343
She's awakening, I fear.

59:54.645 --> 59:58.048
That's why I don't wanna
go in there,

59:58.082 --> 01:00:00.084
but you...

01:00:02.687 --> 01:00:04.388
Please. For me.

01:00:05.889 --> 01:00:07.958
Let's bring her home.

01:00:07.992 --> 01:00:10.828
They don't realize
what we have, darling.

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:12.963
Okay, just back the fuck up.

01:00:12.997 --> 01:00:14.865
You've never liked me...

01:00:15.332 --> 01:00:16.533
have you, Casey?

01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:18.102
I'm done.

01:00:28.846 --> 01:00:30.180
Help!

01:00:53.437 --> 01:00:55.506
Hang on! I'm coming!

01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:09.486
Sara, what are you doing?

01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:16.894
I form
the light and create darkness.

01:01:16.927 --> 01:01:20.197
I make peace and create evil.

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:24.301
I, the Lord,
do all these things.

01:01:33.812 --> 01:01:36.246
I always said she was trash.

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:47.858
Damn it!

01:02:49.654 --> 01:02:51.588
Bebe.

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:04.736
Fuck.

01:03:04.769 --> 01:03:06.704
Shit.

01:03:07.705 --> 01:03:09.874
Tex. Tex, Tex, Tex!

01:03:11.275 --> 01:03:13.277
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

01:03:13.577 --> 01:03:14.445
Fuck!

01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:17.782
Okay. Fuck!

01:03:19.884 --> 01:03:22.085
- Dylan?
- Help me get him to the bathroom.

01:03:22.119 --> 01:03:24.455
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:03:29.861 --> 01:03:32.496
Hey, hey, hey! All right.

01:03:32.529 --> 01:03:33.564
Oh, my God!

01:03:35.767 --> 01:03:37.735
- Come on.
- Oh, my God!

01:03:48.245 --> 01:03:50.214
I don't know what to do.

01:03:51.448 --> 01:03:54.652
What do I do?

01:03:55.687 --> 01:03:57.020
Shit!

01:03:58.155 --> 01:04:02.326
Tex! Tex!

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:07.498
Tex.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:12.302
Hey. Hey.

01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:14.471
Where is Dylan?

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.388
Go, go, go!

01:04:38.763 --> 01:04:39.898
Fuck.

01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:41.365
I thought you said
you didn't know the code.

01:04:41.398 --> 01:04:42.867
Do you have a better idea?
I'm all ears.

01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:44.167
Okay, just hurry!

01:04:44.201 --> 01:04:46.336
Uh, Dad's birthday is...

01:04:47.204 --> 01:04:50.274
Seventh... Seventh...
Shit.

01:04:50.307 --> 01:04:53.043
Uh, Mom's birthday is...

01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:55.112
Fuck! Uh...

01:04:59.383 --> 01:05:01.819
- Yeah, I got it.
- Come on, come on!

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.156
All right. All right.

01:05:12.396 --> 01:05:14.832
- She's gone.
- You think so?

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:17.100
Yeah, I do.

01:05:20.838 --> 01:05:22.974
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

01:05:23.007 --> 01:05:24.374
I have to make sure.

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.158
Yeah, she's gone.

01:06:09.787 --> 01:06:11.388
- Dylan?
- What the fuck?

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.625
I'm so sorry, man.
I didn't know it was you.

01:06:14.659 --> 01:06:16.995
- I thought you were her.
- You have a gun?

01:06:17.028 --> 01:06:19.196
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it from the safe. I...
- Uh...

01:06:19.229 --> 01:06:20.497
Where did she go?

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.934
Dylan? Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:06:22.967 --> 01:06:24.902
- What are you doing?
- Nick.

01:06:27.204 --> 01:06:29.774
We have a gun now, Dylan.

01:06:29.807 --> 01:06:33.176
This is our best chance
to get out of here alive.

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:34.879
- Without her.
- She needs my help.

01:06:37.514 --> 01:06:39.851
Well, then you don't have
ours, Dylan.

01:06:39.884 --> 01:06:41.551
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:41.585 --> 01:06:44.254
- Dylan. Dylan... Wait. Dylan!
- The sun is coming up. This is our best chance.

01:07:11.849 --> 01:07:13.216
Okay, let's go.

01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:28.465
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:28.498 --> 01:07:30.567
Why are we stopping?

01:07:31.703 --> 01:07:34.005
Okay, we're supposed to go
that way, I think.

01:07:34.038 --> 01:07:35.940
Wait, didn't we just come
from that way?

01:07:36.808 --> 01:07:38.508
No, we came from back there.

01:07:40.078 --> 01:07:41.378
I think.

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:44.148
You think?

01:07:44.182 --> 01:07:46.784
God, I thought you said you knew the
woods like the back of your hand.

01:07:46.818 --> 01:07:49.654
Can we please just go my way?

01:08:03.735 --> 01:08:04.802
What?

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:08.371
We were going straight,
right?

01:08:09.207 --> 01:08:11.341
How the fuck did we end up
back here?

01:08:14.145 --> 01:08:15.612
I'm gonna go find Dylan.

01:08:17.447 --> 01:08:20.550
Okay, I can't...
I can't leave him.

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:22.653
- No, don't.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:22.687 --> 01:08:24.587
Don't... Don't fucking dare...

01:08:39.871 --> 01:08:40.904
Shit!

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:00.457
Dylan?

01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:21.444
It's okay. It's okay.

01:09:22.145 --> 01:09:23.345
Hey. Hey, where's Nick?

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.917
Uh, right outside,
in the woods.

01:09:26.884 --> 01:09:28.618
We got all turned around.

01:09:28.653 --> 01:09:31.354
Hey, he does that to you,
I know.

01:09:31.388 --> 01:09:33.057
Whoa!

01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:34.892
- Nick!
- Dylan.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:38.796
Where did you go, man?

01:09:39.964 --> 01:09:42.532
She ran off on me,
and I wasn't too excited

01:09:42.566 --> 01:09:45.402
about being stuck
back in the house.

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.037
Okay, did you see him?
Where is he?

01:09:47.071 --> 01:09:49.506
No, um...
I don't know, dude. Um...

01:09:49.538 --> 01:09:51.676
Yeah, I think
he's out the front.

01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:54.477
We tried to get out,
but we just ended up back here.

01:09:56.047 --> 01:09:57.347
Okay, look, so we can't...

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.885
- go where the car is, but... Maybe...
- I was just out the front.

01:10:00.918 --> 01:10:01.919
What?

01:10:06.157 --> 01:10:08.458
I was talking about how I...

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.195
Whoa!

01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:13.396
- Nick, stop. Look, Nick...
- I create the light and form the darkness.

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:16.234
- Nick, stop.
- I make peace and create evil.

01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:19.203
I, the Lord,
do all these things.

01:10:19.237 --> 01:10:20.370
Nick, put the gun down!

01:10:37.822 --> 01:10:38.789
Stop, Nick.

01:10:38.823 --> 01:10:40.958
This isn't you! Stop!

01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:43.627
Nick, stop!

01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:50.560
Hey.

01:12:07.345 --> 01:12:09.280
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

01:12:09.313 --> 01:12:10.781
It's his game.

01:12:12.316 --> 01:12:15.753
He wants you to go crazy.

01:12:15.786 --> 01:12:18.656
He'd rather see you suffer
than simply kill you.

01:12:20.725 --> 01:12:22.960
He's enjoying
every second of this.

01:12:24.161 --> 01:12:25.763
It's like he gets off on it.

01:12:27.098 --> 01:12:28.199
I could shoot him.

01:12:29.233 --> 01:12:31.135
Right now. I could end this.

01:12:32.069 --> 01:12:33.104
No.

01:12:35.505 --> 01:12:37.041
You can't.

01:12:50.553 --> 01:12:52.390
Let's go to the woods.

01:12:52.423 --> 01:12:54.325
We already tried that.

01:12:54.358 --> 01:12:56.127
I think it might be different
with her.

01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:12.977
Casey.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.681
I'm gonna run with Bebe.

01:13:18.749 --> 01:13:20.117
Okay, he's gonna chase us,

01:13:20.151 --> 01:13:22.453
and once you see that
the coast is clear,

01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:26.123
you run as fast as you can.

01:13:26.157 --> 01:13:29.193
Okay? And stay on the main road,
so that you don't get turned around again.

01:13:30.593 --> 01:13:32.263
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:13:33.998 --> 01:13:36.867
I promise that I'll come
visit you.

01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:54.118
Promise?

01:13:56.053 --> 01:13:57.154
I promise.

01:14:44.735 --> 01:14:47.771
It's better to just hide here than
run off in the other direction.

01:14:48.806 --> 01:14:50.741
Why are you doing this
for me?

01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.644
Because you're different.

01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:57.982
Like, very different, but that doesn't
mean you have to be a prisoner.

01:15:00.184 --> 01:15:01.185
Fuck!

01:15:03.754 --> 01:15:05.990
Hey! Hey!

01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:09.126
Help! Help! Help!
Help me, please.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.462
- Are you okay?
- Can you please take me to the police?

01:15:11.495 --> 01:15:12.696
Of course. Get in.

01:15:19.503 --> 01:15:21.138
What happened to you?

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:25.442
They're dead.

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:28.279
They're all dead.

01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:39.290
You're safe now, little lady.

01:16:04.748 --> 01:16:05.950
I didn't
tell you this earlier,

01:16:05.983 --> 01:16:09.486
but you're the first boy
I kissed.

01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:12.089
I wanna share something
with you.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.269
I didn't know
I could feel like this.

01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:06.296
Here we go. Come on, Dylan.
Come on.

01:19:07.766 --> 01:19:08.999
Let's go.

01:19:12.469 --> 01:19:16.473
Well, you've made quite the
impression on my little Bebe.

01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:21.945
She came running back to me,
begging for your life.

01:19:21.979 --> 01:19:24.481
It was quite
spectacular, actually.

01:19:25.683 --> 01:19:26.684
Well done.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.630
I don't want any more funny
business from you. Understood?

01:19:39.664 --> 01:19:40.964
Have a seat.

01:19:59.216 --> 01:20:01.452
I'm sorry
about your friends.

01:20:03.855 --> 01:20:05.422
At least one of them
made it.

01:20:06.825 --> 01:20:08.592
Hopefully, she... She did.

01:20:18.736 --> 01:20:20.103
So you're him?

01:20:21.238 --> 01:20:25.542
Shit. No, I'm the babysitter.

01:20:25.576 --> 01:20:28.178
It's a shit job, I tell you.

01:20:28.545 --> 01:20:30.013
Babysitter?

01:20:30.849 --> 01:20:33.016
That is his daughter.

01:20:36.186 --> 01:20:40.892
Well, he's not really a he,
or a she. More like an it.

01:20:40.925 --> 01:20:44.228
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just barge in and take her?

01:20:48.198 --> 01:20:49.734
I mean, why all this?

01:20:51.703 --> 01:20:52.704
Hmm?

01:20:53.838 --> 01:20:55.205
Why my friends?

01:20:57.641 --> 01:20:59.276
Well, your friends...

01:21:00.043 --> 01:21:03.180
That was just business.

01:21:03.213 --> 01:21:06.617
She's a lion
born in captivity.

01:21:07.685 --> 01:21:09.787
Bred to do one thing only.

01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:11.054
To perform.

01:21:11.088 --> 01:21:14.124
But, like any lion
born in the circus,

01:21:14.157 --> 01:21:16.995
she doesn't know
her own strength,

01:21:17.027 --> 01:21:18.495
<i>what she's capable of.</i>

01:21:19.864 --> 01:21:21.966
I am the lion tamer, Dylan.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.903
It's my job to keep
her blind and in line.

01:21:24.936 --> 01:21:27.939
But like any good lion tamer
will tell you,

01:21:27.972 --> 01:21:30.574
your lion will undoubtedly...

01:21:31.943 --> 01:21:34.211
discover
its natural instincts,

01:21:34.244 --> 01:21:36.580
and when it gets spooked,

01:21:36.613 --> 01:21:39.182
you don't want to be trapped
in a cage with it.

01:21:41.585 --> 01:21:42.654
Stand up.

01:21:43.888 --> 01:21:45.255
Come on. Stand up.

01:21:52.797 --> 01:21:54.298
You seem like a good guy.

01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:56.333
And I've agreed
not to kill you,

01:21:56.366 --> 01:21:59.837
but I gotta leave you
with something.

01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:01.138
Stop!

01:22:03.007 --> 01:22:05.342
Get back in the car!

01:22:06.209 --> 01:22:08.412
I promise
you'll never be alone.

01:22:08.445 --> 01:22:09.313
You'll see.

01:22:09.346 --> 01:22:10.715
You're the daughter
of Darkness.

01:22:10.748 --> 01:22:14.117
Now you go off and fall in love?
This is so pathetic.

01:22:14.151 --> 01:22:15.452
Back in the car.

01:22:19.089 --> 01:22:21.793
Well, we're off to
her next concert.

01:22:22.426 --> 01:22:23.695
Have to spread the good word

01:22:23.728 --> 01:22:26.296
to all the little teeny
boppers around the world.

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:29.299
Well, you know what I mean.

01:22:37.374 --> 01:22:38.609
Dylan.

01:22:38.642 --> 01:22:40.979
- Jesus Christ!
- How did I get here?

01:22:41.012 --> 01:22:44.281
Are you...
Are you kidding me?

01:22:44.314 --> 01:22:46.249
After all that crap you gave
me last night with Charles,

01:22:46.283 --> 01:22:48.452
you're gonna ask me,
"How did I get here?"

01:22:49.988 --> 01:22:51.321
Are you for real?

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:56.293
Come on. Look at you,
look at your face.

01:22:58.228 --> 01:22:59.764
What's going on with you?

01:23:00.397 --> 01:23:01.398
Dylan!

01:23:13.011 --> 01:23:16.546
<i>A mass suicide in an occult
ritual by this group of teens.</i>

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.148
<i>We'll keep you posted
on this tragedy...</i>

01:23:18.181 --> 01:23:20.317
- Fuck!
- <i>...as details continue to emerge.</i>

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:31.528
We have to catch our plane
in two hours.

01:23:31.561 --> 01:23:34.564
Next show is Chicago,
tomorrow night.

01:23:38.168 --> 01:23:39.737
Listen to me.

01:23:39.771 --> 01:23:41.238
This is over.

01:23:42.305 --> 01:23:43.708
I kept my promise,

01:23:43.741 --> 01:23:47.244
but I swear,
you try this stunt again...

01:23:48.146 --> 01:23:50.647
he will die
a very horrific death.

01:23:53.951 --> 01:23:55.653
Do you want to try me?

01:24:03.895 --> 01:24:05.228
I'll be just fine.

01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:09.499
I know what I'm doing.

01:24:21.278 --> 01:24:23.114
Fuck! Shit. Shit!

01:24:49.272 --> 01:24:51.608
Dylan? I need to
talk to you, son.

01:24:52.977 --> 01:24:57.148
Dylan, you were over at Nick's.
You need to tell me what happened.

01:24:57.181 --> 01:25:00.584
And remember,
I am a man of God.

01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:02.419
What did I say
about calling me son?

01:25:02.452 --> 01:25:05.422
Quit with all the nonsense
and tell me what happened.

01:25:09.593 --> 01:25:11.129
Where do you want me
to begin?

01:25:11.162 --> 01:25:12.897
Sweet Jesus!

01:25:28.478 --> 01:25:30.480
