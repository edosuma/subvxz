WEBVTT

00:07.475 --> 00:09.008
- A cop.

00:09.009 --> 00:13.446
Ever since I was a kid, I
always wanted to be a cop.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.748
My grandfather was a cop.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.151
My dad was a cop.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.919
And as a man of color,

00:19.920 --> 00:22.155
justice is the
right thing to do.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.257
- I pledge
allegiance to the flag

00:24.258 --> 00:26.826
of the United States of America

00:26.827 --> 00:29.662
and to the republic
for which it stands,

00:29.663 --> 00:33.400
one nation, under
God, indivisible,

00:33.401 --> 00:36.104
with liberty and
justice for all.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.174
I take my job seriously,

00:41.175 --> 00:43.443
morning, noon, and night,

00:43.444 --> 00:46.513
but I just don't know
what today's gonna bring.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.483
But being a cop,
it's never a break.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.186
Look at this kid, Danny Rivera,

00:53.187 --> 00:56.956
like Freddy, chasing
the American dream,

00:56.957 --> 00:58.925
aspiring rapper.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.929
Unfortunately, he's
dating an addict.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.730
Will she get help?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.333
I don't know.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.601
Now her father,

01:08.802 --> 01:10.937
Congressman Russo,

01:10.938 --> 01:12.739
that's a different story.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.774
Something's up with him.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.776
I don't trust him.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.679
But time to go to work.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.584
Time to do what my
wife divorced me for,

01:24.985 --> 01:25.985
a job.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.056
A job that my grandad

01:30.924 --> 01:32.559
and my dad

01:32.560 --> 01:34.562
would be proud of today.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.730
It's time to go get them,

01:37.731 --> 01:40.233
because it's not
about the paycheck.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.870
It's about the love for the job.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.708
- Whatever he says is not true.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.510
Music doesn't pay the bills.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.511
This does.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.348
- Those two guys,

01:55.349 --> 01:57.350
they're full of shit.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.919
I'm in charge here.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.291
It's my world.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.194
They just live in it.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.065
- These guys are delusional.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.701
Believe what you
want to believe.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.035
These are my streets.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.205
I'm in charge.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.109
- I did my part.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.279
Now you're gonna do yours.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.181
- I'll take care of it.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.916
- Gentlemen,
time to get going.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.419
- Copy that.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.429
- Now let me ask something.

03:15.430 --> 03:17.297
How long we know each other?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.531
- Forever.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.532
Excuse me.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.533
- I ever fuck you over?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.969
- Absolutely not.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.705
But things are not
the same anymore.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.808
Got wise guys whacking
bosses left and right

03:28.809 --> 03:31.010
without permission
from the families.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.879
- That's true.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.314
- That's true.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.215
Respect and loyalty,
they don't exist anymore.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.084
You know the Chinese.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.519
They're all fucking demons.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.088
It's the reason why Tony
always sets up these meetings,

03:42.089 --> 03:44.056
so he doesn't get whacked.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.292
- You know what?

03:45.293 --> 03:46.893
Anybody who tries to
fuck this family over,

03:46.894 --> 03:47.927
including the Chinese,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.362
are fucking done.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.830
- You know, Tony,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.164
I think Johnny, Tommy, and I

03:52.165 --> 03:54.000
should all go pay
a visit to Kawasaki

03:54.001 --> 03:55.067
over at the restaurant.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.102
- That's a good idea.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.607
So Tony, where are
we going with this?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.442
You know that rat bastard Sammi?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.277
- Of course.
- He's back out

04:03.278 --> 04:06.012
in the fucking streets.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.814
- Bigmouth Sammi.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.182
All he had to do was suck it up,

04:10.183 --> 04:12.452
serve his time, and shut
his big fucking mouth.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.920
- Yeah.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.888
And five years later, now
who are we stuck with?

04:14.889 --> 04:16.423
The fucking Chinese.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.024
- I trust everybody at this
table's got good intensions.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.928
And remember one thing.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.596
Blood's thicker than water.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.797
- Do me a favor, tell Tommy

04:24.798 --> 04:26.599
to get Tracy a
job at the casino.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.967
I promised her a job over there.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.136
- You got it, Tony.
- Thank you.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.371
- How about this?

04:31.372 --> 04:33.205
I meet you guys
later at the club.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.841
I'll stop to pick up Sal

04:34.842 --> 04:36.142
and then I'll meet you there.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.276
- All right.
- Okay.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.411
- All right?
- All right, buddy.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.579
- Talk to you later.
- All right.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.415
- Take care, guys.
- Chill out.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.653
- Hey, Wong.

04:45.654 --> 04:47.387
I have good news.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.856
Seems like everything
is going as planned.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.558
I just overheard
Tony saying that

04:51.559 --> 04:54.794
he's getting Tracy
a job at the casino.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.029
So what's next?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.766
Okay.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.535
So I'm going to meet those
two guys tonight in the club,

05:02.536 --> 05:05.638
and I'll tell them
your decision.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.641
Wow, I like your outfit!

05:10.678 --> 05:12.645
- Hey, did you happen to see
that girl go up the stairs?

05:12.646 --> 05:13.880
- Yeah, why?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.882
- That puttana was on
the phone with Wong.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.216
- Don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.486
- Okay, thanks.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.427
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.696
- What's going on?

05:29.697 --> 05:32.131
- Hey sweetie, you got
everything ready for your trip?

05:32.132 --> 05:34.033
Are you excited?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.468
- You just do me a favor.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.803
Just do to the club and
tell that girl Tracy

05:36.804 --> 05:37.870
about the job at the casino.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.138
- Yeah, no problem, you got it.

05:39.139 --> 05:39.907
- All right, I'll
talk to you later.

05:39.908 --> 05:40.908
- All right.

This is a nice place.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.286
The view's killer.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.788
The food is great.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.889
- Hey Tony.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.691
I talked to Tommy
about that thing.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.526
He's taking care of it.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.460
- Good, thank you.

05:59.461 --> 06:01.461
- See that blonde over there?

06:01.462 --> 06:03.796
Bella said she caught
her talking to Wong.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.699
What do you want to do?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.935
- I'll take care of it.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.003
- I can't wait to be on my own.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.039
Watch out, Miami, here I come.

06:13.040 --> 06:13.974
- I'm gonna miss you, sis,

06:13.975 --> 06:16.008
but thanks, now I'm the target.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.310
- I'm gonna miss you too, cuz.

that's a problem?

06:33.561 --> 06:34.794

06:34.795 --> 06:36.463
- I'm going
to the restroom.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.531

Take care of that.

- There's my beautiful woman.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.975

- How you doing?

07:25.012 --> 07:28.247
- You can't take what
they say to heart.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.316
We did a great job.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.652
- We did.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.954
That's why I love you.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.023
- I love you.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.592
- You okay?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.361
- Yeah, I'll be good.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.400
- Get back to work.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.672
- Hi mom.

07:51.673 --> 07:53.205
I'm so sorry I'm late.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.808
The baby shower ran a little
bit longer than I expected.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.143
Is everything still going on?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.545
- Yes.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.779
Let's go.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.980
- Hell, how can he
be a lieutenant?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.149
He's seeing all
this stuff going on,

08:03.150 --> 08:04.784
he's not even paying
attention to it.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.820
Something's up with this guy.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.321
I'm here like one week

08:09.322 --> 08:11.490
and I can see all this
stuff going on like this,

08:11.491 --> 08:12.992
which,

08:12.993 --> 08:14.326
I don't know.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.562
Where is he anyway?

08:15.563 --> 08:18.197
He gotta get over
to Freddy Auto Body.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.766
I wonder what's
going on in there.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.767
Gotta go!

08:24.204 --> 08:25.204
Pff.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.075
- Hi guys.

08:28.076 --> 08:29.475
What can I get for you today?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.745
- Two of the usual, please.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.246
- I'm setting up the meeting

08:34.246 --> 08:36.749
with the guy in
charge of the cars.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.352
We'll be going down to
the casino later tonight.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.587
- I'm telling you right now,

08:41.589 --> 08:43.956
I better not get
fucked in this deal.

08:43.957 --> 08:44.792
- Don't worry.

08:44.793 --> 08:46.126
He works for me.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.228
Don't forget,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.397
I'm in charge.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.734
- Where and when?

08:56.604 --> 08:59.071
- The money's in the envelope,

08:59.072 --> 09:00.608
so are the details.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.475
- It's happening as we speak.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.511
The Chinese and all
their associates,

09:05.512 --> 09:08.080
they're getting
fucking eliminated.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.716
- Burn, motherfucker!

09:13.687 --> 09:15.287
- Yeah.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.789
The Italians are gonna get it.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.292
- Puttana!

09:36.476 --> 09:37.476
- Bitch.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.452
Bitch.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.492
- Tony, can I get
you anything else?

09:53.493 --> 09:54.327
- No, we're good.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.829
Thank you so much.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.131
- Aren't
we some sick fucks?

09:59.132 --> 10:01.433
- The sickest
motherfuckers.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.601
Salud.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.602
- Salud.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.242
You better look out for Johnny.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.044
Word on the street has it

10:12.045 --> 10:15.382
that he may be working
with the Chinese.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.417
- As you all know,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.820
we've been facing a crisis
with the Elite teams.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.989
- There has been many
killings and carjackings.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.391
We've been surveilling
Freddy's shop.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.893
- Elite moves fast.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.328
They can track a
car in 30 seconds,

10:29.329 --> 10:32.031
then get it over
to Freddy's place.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.034
- Yeah, that Freddy,
he's a scumbag.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.869
- Freddy has also been
known to sell cars

10:36.870 --> 10:40.339
to the international
crime organizations.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.375
Louie and ENJ, they always walk,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.144
thanks to Detective Rivera,

10:45.145 --> 10:48.214
and I bet he's late again too.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.616
- I'm about to take
down two suspects today

10:50.617 --> 10:53.452
who we believe are part of
the Elite Carjacking Team.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.388
- Let me guess, Pearl White,
and her accomplice is Savannah?

10:56.389 --> 10:57.389
- Yes.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.960
- I believe this is a
lot deeper than we know.

11:00.961 --> 11:04.296
- I would like to welcome
a new member to our team.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.732
- If you don't mind,

11:05.733 --> 11:07.934
can you please give us a little
background in who you are?

11:07.935 --> 11:08.769
- Yes.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.602
Good morning.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.137
I'm Detective Bonacasa.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.306
I am a Special Task Force
member for 20 years.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.442
I was assigned to
this department,

11:16.443 --> 11:18.878
and I transferred from Miami.

11:18.879 --> 11:19.780
That's about it.

11:19.781 --> 11:20.781
- Yeah, welcome.
- Welcome.

11:20.782 --> 11:22.214
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.916
- Detective Magnus and
Perez are no longer with us.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.785
They were transferred
to Chicago.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.787
- Can we transfer
Detective Rivera too?

11:29.757 --> 11:31.090
- We're home!

11:31.091 --> 11:32.091
Hee hee!

11:33.226 --> 11:34.895
Come on, pretty boy!

11:36.296 --> 11:37.463
Come on, handsome.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.831
- Got the wrong blood
cop right there.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.132
- Yeah, you're
motherfucking innocent now.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.400
- Loosen up the cuff now.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.269
- I'll loosen up
your fucking face.

11:42.270 --> 11:43.770
Shut the fuck up.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.080
- Yeah, mon!

11:55.849 --> 11:57.283
- Why you smelling
like that, brother?

11:57.284 --> 11:58.384
- Listen asshole, let
me tell you something.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.685
You smell like rice and beans.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.420
And let me tell you
something, asshole.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.289
You missed every one of those.

12:02.290 --> 12:03.790
You fucking black.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.525
- I'll suck your
blood black, man.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.860
- Listen, let me
tell you something.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.964
Black lives don't
matter here, bitch.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.333
Come on, rice and beans.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.602
Keep it moving, asshole.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.070
- She's accusing me of cheating!

12:18.071 --> 12:19.271
- Yeah?

12:19.272 --> 12:20.207
So how do you explain
a woman's panties

12:20.207 --> 12:21.008
in the backseat of your car?

12:21.009 --> 12:22.241
They just flew in?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.210
They're not mine!

12:23.210 --> 12:24.077
- I'm being set up.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.045
I swear to God.

12:25.046 --> 12:26.378
I never seen them.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.746
- You call yourself a detective

12:27.747 --> 12:30.382
and that's the best you can do?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.583
- Let me tell you something.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.186
I am done with men.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.488
Sanchez,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.891
would you like to go
for a drink later?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.026
- I'll go, but

12:40.027 --> 12:41.694
don't get any ideas.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.697
- I'm
straight, let's go for it.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.600
- While the lieutenant and I-
- Man, you ready?

12:48.601 --> 12:52.204
- Are on
our way to Freddy's shop,

12:52.205 --> 12:55.141
another carjacking
is in progress.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.142
ENJ.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.878
Lightheaded.

13:01.849 --> 13:02.782
- Hurry, get out the car!

13:02.782 --> 13:03.716
- And Red.

13:03.717 --> 13:04.951
- Let's go, get out the car!

13:04.952 --> 13:07.419
- The
Elite Carjacking Team

13:07.420 --> 13:08.655
is at it again.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.625
There's no clue

13:14.727 --> 13:15.727
who's next

13:16.429 --> 13:17.596
- Go, go!

13:17.597 --> 13:18.965
- No one knows.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.240
- Hi, can I help you?

13:28.241 --> 13:29.808
- We're looking for Freddy.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.743
- Freddy who?

13:30.744 --> 13:32.078
We have two that work here.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.679
- The owner of
this establishment,

13:33.680 --> 13:35.747
can you tell us where
we could find him?

13:35.748 --> 13:36.583
- He took the day off today.

13:36.584 --> 13:38.617
Can I help you?

13:38.618 --> 13:41.687
- Looks like you've got
some expensive cars here.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.688
- Fuck.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.392
- I'm new here.

13:45.393 --> 13:48.027
You'd have to ask Freddy.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.461
- Can you let him know
that Lorenzo and Brown

13:49.462 --> 13:50.629
paid him a visit?

13:50.630 --> 13:51.630
- Sure.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.933
- Okay, have a nice day.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.401
- Have a good day.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.137
Thank you, you too.

13:58.138 --> 13:58.972
- I
think I heard that asshole

13:58.973 --> 14:00.406
behind the door.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.108
- I
think that asshole was there.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.679
- Fuck.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.916
The detectives,
what did they want?

14:09.917 --> 14:10.750
- What do you think?

14:10.751 --> 14:11.984
They wanted to know

14:11.985 --> 14:12.985
why there are so many
expensive cars here.

14:12.986 --> 14:13.921
- They're snooping around.

14:13.922 --> 14:15.254
I don't like it.

14:15.255 --> 14:15.923
- They're snooping around.
- I don't know

14:15.923 --> 14:16.723
what's going on,

14:16.723 --> 14:17.524
I don't want to know.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.325
- Nothing's going on.

14:18.326 --> 14:20.026
I run a legit business.

14:20.027 --> 14:20.860
- I know it's your business.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.594
I just work for you.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.795
- Calm down, relax.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.097
Everything is fine.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.365
Get to work.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.566
- Before I forget, they
said they're coming back

14:27.567 --> 14:28.901
and they're turning
this place upside-down.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.236
- Shut up!

14:30.237 --> 14:32.438
I need time to think!

14:32.439 --> 14:35.007
I need time to think.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.743
I need time to think.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.013
I need time to think.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.350
I need time to think.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.851
- Yo.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.987
There's a girl out
there looking for ENJ.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.556
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.093
- That's Pink.

14:53.093 --> 14:53.994
Send her back here.

14:53.995 --> 14:55.227
- Are you sure?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.163
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.065
She's cool.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.065
- Okay.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.139
J.R's in the back office
where I just came out of.

15:07.140 --> 15:07.975
- Thanks.

15:07.975 --> 15:08.908
Kinda cute there, boy.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.742
My type.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.110
What's your name?

15:11.111 --> 15:12.945
- They call me Red.

15:12.946 --> 15:13.913
- Hey yo Pink, get in here.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.781
I ain't got all day.

15:15.782 --> 15:16.616
- Bye, Red.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.450
- Get back here.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.450
We ain't got all day.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.160
- So, did you tell ENJ about me?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.029
- Yeah, everything's cool.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.797
He said he's got some
jackings coming up.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.399
- Count me in.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.102
- If everything
goes according to plan,

15:36.103 --> 15:37.269
welcome to the Elite.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.604
- Wow, a pink gun?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.605
Awesome!

15:39.606 --> 15:40.607
That's nice!

15:41.708 --> 15:43.342
- Bye the way,
Ruby got locked up.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.377
- Sorry to hear that.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.046
- It's business.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.380
I'll keep in touch with you.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.316
- I'll see you soon, okay?

15:49.317 --> 15:50.416
Bye.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.751
- See you later.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.425
- Pretty sure I'm
gonna see you again.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.760
- Maybe you will.

16:01.761 --> 16:02.761
Bye, Red.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.638
- Morning.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.906
- Have a nice day.

16:14.907 --> 16:15.907
- You too.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.056
- So, Detective Rivera,

16:30.057 --> 16:32.258
are you and Brown ever
bringing in Louie?

16:32.259 --> 16:34.826
- You ever gonna
become a real detective?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.162
- It's almost
the end of the month.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.064
How many callers you have, one?

16:38.065 --> 16:39.465
- I see you've got
jokes for days.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.966
Why don't you have
another doughnut?

16:40.967 --> 16:43.069
Looking like you're getting
a little wide in the can.

16:43.070 --> 16:47.406
- You know they're
taking applications for cadets.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.640
Know what?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.376
I bet at the end of the
month Detective Davina

16:50.377 --> 16:52.111
has more callers than you.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.212
- I bet you 50,

16:53.213 --> 16:54.513
matter of fact, make it 100,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.248
that by the end of the
month I bring in Louie

16:56.249 --> 16:58.784
and I have more
callers than Davina.

16:58.785 --> 16:59.719
- Okay.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.420
I'll take you up on that bet.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.155
But at the end of the month,

17:03.156 --> 17:05.391
if Detective Davina has
more callers then you,

17:05.392 --> 17:06.392
you owe me double.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.627
By the way, you're
wasting my time.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.597
I have real police
business to do.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.598
- Good morning,
Detective Sanchez.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.534
- Good morning, Mayor.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.135
Would you like a cup of coffee?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.236
- I would, I would.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.804
That would help me wake up.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.606
- Good, I'm glad.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.444
- Detective Sanchez,
when are we gonna go out?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.247
- First of all, you're married.

17:28.248 --> 17:32.518
Second of all, you couldn't
handle a girl like me.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.785
And third of all,

17:33.786 --> 17:36.155
my boyfriend wouldn't
be too happy about it.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.290
- Sanchez, you're killing me.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.692
- Is it the eyes?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.530
- I'm not ready to give
up on those eyes just yet.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.265
- Good morning, Mayor.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.501
Are we still on
for our lunch date?

17:49.502 --> 17:52.138
- You're having lunch with
Gordon and dinner with me?

17:52.139 --> 17:55.274
- I'm just here to
see Captain Jackson.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.575
Is she around?

17:56.576 --> 17:57.709
- Her office is that way,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.879
but you already knew that.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.013
- Yeah, don't bother.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.916
She just left with
Detective Franco.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.917
Good luck.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.689
- I'm gonna go there.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.890
- We have to make sure that

18:11.891 --> 18:14.393
the Chinese do
not find the girl.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.295
- True.

18:15.296 --> 18:16.528
She's well-hidden,

18:16.529 --> 18:17.996
where no one is
going to find her.

18:17.997 --> 18:18.997
Don't worry.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.866
Congressman's brothers and wife

18:20.867 --> 18:22.434
are coming in this afternoon.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.071
I am going to intercept
them with a gun.

18:26.072 --> 18:30.676
- Make sure that they do not
live to tell their story.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.144
- They won't.

18:32.145 --> 18:36.448
They hold a black clouds
over the Congressman's head.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.951
- Take this disc to your home,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.488
and do not bring it back.

18:42.489 --> 18:47.093
This disc is gonna tell you
everything that's going on.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.667
- Feels good to
have a clean shave.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.503
- Forget about the shave.

18:56.504 --> 18:58.070
Let's get this car.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.107
Watch her.

19:01.108 --> 19:02.308
She's getting out the car.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.309
Let's get this car!

19:22.395 --> 19:23.929
Hey Red, hurry up!
- My car!

19:23.930 --> 19:24.930
- Red, hurry up, she's coming!
- Where are you taking my car?

19:24.931 --> 19:26.798
- Shit!
- Come on!

19:26.799 --> 19:27.833
- Get outta my car!

19:27.834 --> 19:29.000
Get outta my car!

19:29.001 --> 19:30.236
- Hey lady, take this!

19:30.237 --> 19:32.771
- Why'd you have
to shoot her for?!

19:36.243 --> 19:38.677
- They shot my husband!

19:38.678 --> 19:40.212
- Stop or I'll shoot!

19:44.083 --> 19:46.685
- You were told not
to trust a stranger.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.375
- What direction were you
coming when you saw this body?

20:09.376 --> 20:11.510
- I was jogging
in this direction,

20:11.511 --> 20:13.111
and I saw the body on my left,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.381
and my dog stopped
really quickly.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.684
- Did you see anybody in the
area where you were jogging?

20:18.685 --> 20:20.452
- I, I don't remember.

20:20.453 --> 20:24.089
She, she did have
a bruise on her face,

20:24.090 --> 20:25.757
or at least that's
what it looked like.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.059
Um, and she did kind
of seem nervous,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.529
now that I'm thinking about it.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.198
Yeah, buddy, I know.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.336
- That's it?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.304
You don't,

20:37.305 --> 20:40.105
you don't recall anything else?

20:42.108 --> 20:45.043
The guy, he had, he
had a baseball cap on,

20:45.044 --> 20:46.812
and sunglasses,

20:46.813 --> 20:50.316
and, the, the girl
was wearing a dress,

20:50.317 --> 20:52.618
but that, that's all I remember.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.986
- Do you remember how
tall they might've been?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.388
- No, it was really fast.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.389
I'm sorry.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.091
- So you ready to go to work?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.360
- Work, that's all I ever do.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.894
- That's true.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.896
Trying to catch the bad guys.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.164
- You know Detective Rivera?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.099
- Yeah.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.400
- He's a nice guy, isn't he?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.435
- Are you kidding me?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.470
So he has you fooled too?

21:11.471 --> 21:13.472
- No, but he buys me
coffee every morning.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.507
I really don't mind
if he kisses my ass.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.675
- He's a guy.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.277
They all have ulterior motives.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.712
I can see what he sees in you.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.381
- Thank you.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.549
But you know we're just friends.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.151
I am not sleeping with him.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.719
- On to the next one.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.887
Do you know he
always has an excuse

21:28.888 --> 21:30.722
for coming in to work late?

21:30.723 --> 21:33.058
Last time he said he drove
his car through the carwash

21:33.059 --> 21:35.661
and left his windows
down and he got flooded!

21:35.662 --> 21:37.929
I thought, "Put your
windows up, asshole!"

21:37.930 --> 21:39.598
- Wow.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.934
But you know, he does have
nice eyes, doesn't he?

21:42.935 --> 21:44.202
- Really?

21:44.203 --> 21:46.973
Remind me to get you
a pair of glasses.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.174
- Get off of me, bro!

21:49.175 --> 21:50.842
I didn't do anything!

21:50.843 --> 21:52.211
- What the fuck?!

21:53.646 --> 21:56.015
- Sit down, shut the fuck up!

21:58.284 --> 21:59.985
We know you're part
of the Elite Team.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.453
- I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.889
- I don't know what the
fuck you are talking about.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.393
- You gotta talk to the judge.

22:13.466 --> 22:16.034
- I just came from Morris Park.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.168
You remember Amie,

22:17.169 --> 22:19.204
the one that's
married to Detective--

22:19.205 --> 22:20.205
- Raul.
- Raul.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.611
- She was found
dead at the park.

22:25.612 --> 22:26.446
- My.

22:26.447 --> 22:28.114
- Strangled, beaten.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.952
- You think Raul did it?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.286
- Maybe.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.890
See, I lost all respect of Raul

22:39.058 --> 22:41.427
when I found out he
was beating his wife.

22:42.895 --> 22:47.399
and then when I get promoted
to being the lieutenant,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.135
he wanted a transfer,

22:50.503 --> 22:52.405
so they gave it to him.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.641
- So what do I owe the
pleasure of this visit?

23:01.147 --> 23:03.582
- I needed to talk
to a close friend.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.084
- Tony's not here.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.754
- I came to talk to you.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.989
- What's on your mind?

23:10.990 --> 23:13.725
- I have a lot on my mind.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.995
Remember when we were younger,

23:16.996 --> 23:19.831
all the good times that
we shared together?

23:19.832 --> 23:22.033
- Adriana, you're beautiful.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.469
- Lorenzo,

23:23.470 --> 23:25.437
I love being with you.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.338
- I love being with you too.

We went that route.

23:45.492 --> 23:48.527
Especially with your
track record with women.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.597
You've planted your seed.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.070
- What can I do
for you gentlemen?

23:59.071 --> 24:00.506
- Knock the shit off, Kawasaki.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.273
You know why we're here.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.111
- To discuss the
girl or the cars?

24:06.345 --> 24:07.345
- Both.

24:08.347 --> 24:09.848
We're here to make
the boss happy,

24:09.849 --> 24:11.617
and so are fucking you!

24:11.618 --> 24:13.119
Watch it, big man!

24:16.589 --> 24:19.024
- What's that noise?

24:19.025 --> 24:20.091
- I didn't hear nothing.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.027
Did you hear anything?

24:21.027 --> 24:21.861
- Nothing.

24:21.862 --> 24:23.562

24:23.563 --> 24:26.998
What the fuck are
you talking about?!

24:26.999 --> 24:29.835

25:09.576 --> 25:13.512

and didn't invite us?

25:14.914 --> 25:18.183
- You guys know
we're the life of the party.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.752
Now where are the cars?

25:20.753 --> 25:22.688
- We don't have any cars.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.789
This is a restaurant business.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.256
Take a look yourself.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.092
- I know you have them!

25:26.093 --> 25:27.927
Where are the cars at?

25:28.795 --> 25:29.928
- I told you,

25:29.929 --> 25:31.429
there aren't any cars here.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.098
- That's impossible.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.233
How are you transporting them?

25:35.234 --> 25:37.069
Are you using tunnels?

25:40.106 --> 25:41.106
They're using tunnels.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.949
- Hi, can I have your autograph?

25:53.720 --> 25:54.687
- Don't forget me.

25:54.688 --> 25:55.987
How long you been doing this?

25:55.988 --> 25:57.088
- About three years.

25:57.089 --> 25:57.924
- Awesome.

25:57.924 --> 25:58.791
Great voice.

25:58.791 --> 25:59.626
- Thank you.

25:59.627 --> 26:01.059
- Thank you.

26:01.060 --> 26:05.998
- Tommy, your rap
sheet is as long as your mouth.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.967
- Excuse me, detective.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.002
You don't even look like
a fucking detective.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.537
You look like a cadet
out of the academy.

26:12.538 --> 26:13.571
- I'll steal your
chain, asshole!

26:13.572 --> 26:14.873
- All right, enough!

26:14.874 --> 26:16.107
Listen, we know,

26:16.108 --> 26:17.976
we know there's a
war on the streets.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.177
- With who?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.178
- Don't play stupid.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.512
It's with the Elite.

26:21.513 --> 26:25.117
If anything happens,
I'm coming here first.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.453
- Good day, detectives.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.221
I have a restaurant
business to attend to.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.223
- I'm sure you do.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.159
I will arrest you.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.326
- See yourself out.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.327
- Goodbye.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.230
And you,

26:43.569 --> 26:46.338
I'll be back for
you, sweetheart.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.876
- Ciao.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.110
- All right, Pink,

26:52.111 --> 26:53.178
now's your time to prove
yourself to the Elite.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.347
- Don't worry, I got this.

26:56.783 --> 26:57.816
There's that beauty.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.450
I want that car.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.319
I've been watching it for days.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.553
- Beauty for sure.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.991
Just keep an eye
out for the cops.

27:06.893 --> 27:07.893
- There ain't no cops.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.060
Take the safety off the gun.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.228
- I'm way ahead of you.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.063
You're new.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.363
You'll learn in time.

27:12.364 --> 27:17.369
- All
right, here she comes.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.137
- Yes, it's showtime.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.887
Yo, it's starting to
rain, let's go get them.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.188
- I think they're coming.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.456
- Fuck, then take this.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.125
- You might have to use it.
- Stash it!

27:39.125 --> 27:39.892
Stash it!

27:39.892 --> 27:40.892
Stash it!

27:41.728 --> 27:43.094
- It looks like cops.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.030
- Get out of the car!

27:44.030 --> 27:44.831
- Get out of the car!

27:44.832 --> 27:46.164
Get out of the car!

27:46.165 --> 27:47.465
- Yo, what the hell?

27:47.466 --> 27:48.466
- Get out of
the car right now!

27:48.467 --> 27:49.600
Out of the car!

27:53.505 --> 27:54.340
- Go, Pink!

27:54.341 --> 27:55.606
- No!

27:55.607 --> 27:57.508
- Yo, yo!
- That's my mom's car!

27:57.509 --> 27:58.844
- Yo, where you taking the car?

27:58.845 --> 28:00.145
- What the hell?!

28:00.146 --> 28:03.281
ENJ, you could've stopped her!

28:03.282 --> 28:04.282
- So what's up, honey.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.516
- Nothing much, Sheila.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.185
- You want
to do a shot with me?

28:06.186 --> 28:07.418
- Let's do it.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.653
- All right, I
got something special.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.455
- You always got
something special.

28:09.456 --> 28:10.621
- All right, let's see.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.592
That's what they say!

28:14.593 --> 28:15.594
- I love it.

28:16.763 --> 28:17.996
- So what you been
doing with yourself?

28:17.997 --> 28:19.530
- A little of this,
a little of that.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.332
Too much of this, and
not enough of that.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.533
- Where is this broad?

28:22.534 --> 28:23.335
When are we gonna get
a drink over here?

28:23.336 --> 28:24.602
- I don't know.

28:24.603 --> 28:25.471
We've been here since
2:00 in the afternoon.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.305
It's 6:00.

28:26.306 --> 28:27.538
Where the hell is she?

28:27.539 --> 28:28.840
- That's a pretty long
time for it to be.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.275
We look like fucking
idiots in here.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.609
- It was a joke.

28:31.610 --> 28:32.844
- Well it wasn't too funny.

28:32.845 --> 28:33.645
- Why don't you have
a, don't you have a...

28:33.646 --> 28:34.813
You can't take a joke?

28:34.814 --> 28:35.981
- I don't think
you're not that funny.

28:35.982 --> 28:36.949
- You're not that funny.

28:36.950 --> 28:38.183
You're never that funny.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.385
- What makes you think
you're so fucking funny?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.953
- I didn't come up with
the waitress theory,

28:41.954 --> 28:42.954
you did.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.923
- That was a theory?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.724
- I don't know what
the hell it was.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.160
- What are you, an
authority on waitresses now?

28:49.161 --> 28:50.929
- I was told the the cars
were in a secret location.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.998
No one knows where
the girls are at.

28:52.999 --> 28:56.701
- So you have no idea where
they are keeping the cars,

28:56.702 --> 28:58.403
and the girl hasn't been found.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.938
- I have no idea.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.239
I was supposed to work at
the casino with Big Tony,

29:01.240 --> 29:03.674
and I'm waiting for Tommy now.

29:03.675 --> 29:06.644
- Mr. Wong's patience
are running out.

29:06.645 --> 29:10.916
He has a deadline to deliver
the cars and the girl.

a special girl friend of mine.

47:13.364 --> 47:14.631
Her name's Lucille.

47:14.632 --> 47:18.602

rats will eat him.

47:27.645 --> 47:29.213
Fucking rat that he is.

47:29.214 --> 47:30.280
- Nobody fucks with me!

47:30.281 --> 47:32.549
Nobody fucks with the family!

47:32.550 --> 47:35.219

47:35.220 --> 47:36.686
They're about to
meet their fate.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.162
- Ink watched the whole
thing from her window

47:45.163 --> 47:47.264
when they hit the bumper.

47:47.265 --> 47:49.600
Yo, you ready for the Elite?

47:51.169 --> 47:52.836
- Nine ball, side pocket.

47:52.837 --> 47:56.173
- It's not every day I
get to roll an old team.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.674
- Elite's about loyalty,

47:57.675 --> 48:00.677
about keeping it
real with each other.

48:00.678 --> 48:02.179
- This is where I belong.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.313
- You can't
bring this back to Freddy's.

48:03.314 --> 48:04.381
It's way too hot.

48:04.382 --> 48:05.782
Man, go open the gate there.

48:05.783 --> 48:06.783
- All right.

48:12.623 --> 48:14.424
Shit, we got company!

48:15.394 --> 48:16.927
- Wait, did you hear that?

48:16.928 --> 48:18.095
- We have company.

48:18.096 --> 48:19.064
You go outside.

48:19.064 --> 48:19.965
You follow me.

48:19.965 --> 48:20.965
Let's go!

48:42.787 --> 48:43.721
- You guys came here late!

48:43.722 --> 48:45.189
- Motherfuckers gotta away!

48:45.190 --> 48:46.656
You believe that shit?
- Shit!

48:46.657 --> 48:47.824
Yeah man, trying
to freaking kill us

48:47.825 --> 48:51.229
and you guys come
running out there late.

48:53.098 --> 48:54.298
- We need to talk about Pink.

48:54.299 --> 48:55.299
What are we gonna do with her?

48:55.300 --> 48:56.300
- I can't discuss it.

48:56.301 --> 48:57.534
I'm running late as it is,

48:57.535 --> 48:58.568
and I still have
to hit the office.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.004
- It's your daughter, not mine.

49:00.005 --> 49:01.571
We need to talk about this!

49:01.572 --> 49:03.073
- I get it,

49:03.074 --> 49:04.541
but I have an important
event with the president,

49:04.542 --> 49:06.710
so we're just gonna have to
table this until later tonight,

49:06.711 --> 49:08.045
like when I get home, okay?

49:08.046 --> 49:08.913
- It's your daughter!

49:08.914 --> 49:11.081
- I said the president!

49:11.082 --> 49:12.549
I'm not gonna be the
guy who walks in late,

49:12.550 --> 49:13.850
interrupts the president,

49:13.851 --> 49:15.285
and gets on the
nightly news like,

49:15.286 --> 49:19.456
"Sorry, my bad, dude, it's
just me, Congressman Jerk off!"

49:19.457 --> 49:20.890
- You're a jerk!

49:20.891 --> 49:22.892
You don't even know she's
gonna be home later!

49:22.893 --> 49:25.362
- Look, Pink is the
self-sufficient one.

49:25.363 --> 49:27.097
She can take care of herself.

49:27.098 --> 49:28.665
She's not like Jill.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.800
So maybe you're just blowing
things out of proportion

49:30.801 --> 49:32.169
a little bit.

49:32.170 --> 49:33.670
- I tried to talk to her.

49:33.671 --> 49:35.072
She's rude and disrespectful,

49:35.073 --> 49:36.340
telling me I'm not her mom!

49:36.341 --> 49:39.209
Do you know how
that makes me feel?!

49:39.210 --> 49:41.645
- I'm trying to be a good
dad to both these girls.

49:41.646 --> 49:44.081
Growing up, it was
just my brother and I.

49:44.082 --> 49:45.315
We struggled,

49:45.316 --> 49:48.118
so give me an A
for effort, okay?

49:48.119 --> 49:49.919
I'm just trying to
get out of here.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.021
Give me a kiss so I can leave.

49:51.022 --> 49:52.589
- No, go!

49:52.590 --> 49:54.958
Go have fun at your event!

49:54.959 --> 49:55.793
See if I care!

49:55.794 --> 49:57.194
I'm so sick of this!

49:57.195 --> 49:59.363
Did you forget I have
a great career too?!

49:59.364 --> 50:00.865
- I didn't forget!

50:16.347 --> 50:17.582
I love you too!

50:33.764 --> 50:36.533
- See you
changed your clothes.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.935
- What's the matter,
dad made you cry again?

50:38.936 --> 50:42.239
- Why do you always have
to treat me that way?

50:42.240 --> 50:45.109
- You
just don't get it.

50:45.110 --> 50:46.276
I don't like you.

50:46.277 --> 50:47.811
- What's the matter?

50:47.812 --> 50:49.413
You jealous because dad
pays more attention to me?

50:49.414 --> 50:50.814
Is that what's bothering you?

50:50.815 --> 50:52.048
- Are you serious?!

50:52.049 --> 50:53.450
He doesn't care about no one.

50:53.451 --> 50:55.619
All he cares about is
politics, his lawyers,

50:55.620 --> 50:57.887
and this marriage, you
call this a marriage?

50:57.888 --> 50:58.955
This ain't no marriage.

50:58.956 --> 51:00.457
It's more like a fiasco.

51:00.458 --> 51:01.791
- It's because of
you and your sister.

51:01.792 --> 51:03.026
You put a strain
on our marriage.

51:03.027 --> 51:04.194
You're so disrespectful,

51:04.195 --> 51:05.495
and your sister's out there

51:05.496 --> 51:07.030
hanging around with
all the wrong people!

51:07.031 --> 51:08.765
What do you think
is gonna happen?!

51:08.766 --> 51:10.300
- You criticize everyone!

51:10.301 --> 51:12.536
You talk about everyone!

51:12.537 --> 51:15.272
Late hours at the
office, my ass.

51:15.273 --> 51:17.274
It's more like you're
having an affair.

51:18.110 --> 51:19.876
- You bitch!

51:19.877 --> 51:22.146
I don't need to take this
abuse from you or anyone else.

51:22.147 --> 51:23.480
Do you understand?

51:23.481 --> 51:25.215
- I should kill you.

51:25.216 --> 51:26.883
I hated you before,

51:26.884 --> 51:28.719
but now I despise you.

51:30.355 --> 51:31.621
- Maybe you should've
thought about

51:31.622 --> 51:35.024
the next time you won't
be treating me this way.

51:35.025 --> 51:37.694
- Next time you touch
me, I will kill you!

51:42.066 --> 51:43.733
- Jill!

51:43.734 --> 51:44.968
What are you doing here?!

51:44.969 --> 51:46.529
I told you I don't
want to see you here!

51:47.538 --> 51:48.838
- I just came to
see an old friend.

51:48.839 --> 51:50.207
- Yeah, she just came
to see her old friend.

51:50.208 --> 51:51.675
- You, shut up!

51:51.676 --> 51:52.510
What's in your hand?

51:52.511 --> 51:53.511
- Nothing's in my hand.

51:53.512 --> 51:54.544
- What is in your hand?

51:54.545 --> 51:55.380
- Nothing's in my hand!

51:55.381 --> 51:57.347
You're such an ass!

51:57.348 --> 51:58.615
- My parents want
to send me away

51:58.616 --> 52:01.084
to an all-girls school in Texas.

52:01.085 --> 52:03.387
- To stimulate from
your pill addiction?

52:03.388 --> 52:04.388
- Pill?

52:06.157 --> 52:08.592
You promised me you weren't
gonna do this anymore!

52:08.593 --> 52:10.694
- You promised you'd
stop carjacking, asshole.

52:10.695 --> 52:13.530
Stop bullying your girlfriend.

52:13.531 --> 52:14.699
- You shut up.

52:16.167 --> 52:20.537
You're lucky your aunt's the
captain of the police force.

52:20.538 --> 52:22.239
- Leave Script out of this.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.273
He's just trying to help.

52:23.274 --> 52:24.275
- Help you?!

52:25.676 --> 52:27.711
By feeding you pills?!

52:27.712 --> 52:31.716
- All I ever wanted was
my music career and you.

52:32.883 --> 52:35.151
I didn't want to be
in these streets.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.521
- Is the girl ready
to be transported?

52:37.522 --> 52:38.788
- Yes, everything's a go.

52:38.789 --> 52:39.989
We're just waiting
on the department

52:39.990 --> 52:42.192
to give us a green light
so we can pull out.

52:42.193 --> 52:45.962
- Because of the sensitivity
and the nature of this case,

52:45.963 --> 52:47.431
we don't know where
they're taking her.

52:47.432 --> 52:48.832
- Headquarters already
put the coordinates

52:48.833 --> 52:50.800
in the GPSs in our vehicles.

52:50.801 --> 52:53.303
They're monitoring
our every move.

52:53.304 --> 52:56.406
- Regardless, you have to have
your ears and your eyes open

52:56.407 --> 52:57.774
at all times.

52:57.775 --> 53:01.211
The Chinese have
affiliations all over.

53:01.212 --> 53:02.379
- Yes, I know.

53:02.380 --> 53:03.913
I'm aware of the
severity of the case,

53:03.914 --> 53:05.582
which is why I'm on the case.

53:05.583 --> 53:07.150
I'm trained in combat.

53:07.151 --> 53:09.853
- Look, you're my sister.

53:09.854 --> 53:13.490
I don't want nothing
to happen to you.

53:13.491 --> 53:17.193
When I first learned that you
were gonna be part of Task,

53:17.194 --> 53:18.862
I was hoping you'd
fail training.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.730
- Why would you
want me to fail?!

53:20.731 --> 53:23.099
- It's not like that.

53:23.100 --> 53:26.336
It's that I know
law enforcement.

53:26.337 --> 53:28.305
It has its perks,

53:28.306 --> 53:30.640
but sometimes it's grueling.

53:30.641 --> 53:31.841
- Don't worry about me.

53:31.842 --> 53:34.411
I can take care of myself.

53:34.412 --> 53:35.579
And I would love to stay here

53:35.580 --> 53:36.846
and finish this
conversation with you,

53:36.847 --> 53:39.183
but transport commences now.

53:41.452 --> 53:43.120
Tell mom I love her.

53:43.988 --> 53:44.989
- Safe trip.

53:46.156 --> 53:48.057
I have to make my
way to Morris Park.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.259
I have an individual

53:49.260 --> 53:50.994
that's meeting me
there in five minutes.

53:50.995 --> 53:51.862
- Okay.

53:51.863 --> 53:53.229
- Then I have to go

53:53.230 --> 53:56.132
tighten up some loose
ends with a friend.

53:56.133 --> 53:57.001
- A friend?

53:57.002 --> 53:58.035
Which friend?

53:59.704 --> 54:00.904
- Can't tell you,

54:00.905 --> 54:03.840
because if I did, I
would have to kill you.

54:03.841 --> 54:04.841
- Ha ha.

54:07.312 --> 54:08.413
- Be careful.

54:10.415 --> 54:13.082
- I will.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.352
- What's wrong?

54:15.720 --> 54:16.986
- Ma, this isn't fair.

54:16.987 --> 54:19.523
Jill's parents want to
take her away from me.

54:19.524 --> 54:20.358
- Why?

54:20.359 --> 54:21.858
What's wrong?

54:21.859 --> 54:23.493
- Because of a
pill addiction, ma.

54:23.494 --> 54:25.194
I already told you this.

54:25.195 --> 54:28.498
Her parents now are
blaming me for this.

54:28.499 --> 54:30.500
- You're not doing pills I hope.

54:30.501 --> 54:31.768
- Of course not, ma.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.169
- I can't take this!

54:33.170 --> 54:34.471
- Of course not, ma!

54:34.472 --> 54:36.473
- Are you sure?

54:36.474 --> 54:38.809
- Ma, dad was a drug addict!

54:39.744 --> 54:41.445
He left us to die!

54:41.446 --> 54:44.180
- Don't talk about your father!

54:44.181 --> 54:45.583
He was a scumbag!

54:48.118 --> 54:49.119
- Sorry, ma.

54:50.555 --> 54:54.190
- Look, I've never seen you
in love like this before.

54:54.191 --> 54:55.025
- I see myself in love with her.

54:55.026 --> 54:56.793
- I know you love her.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.428
- I do.

54:58.429 --> 54:59.929
- But it scares me.

54:59.930 --> 55:02.032
- It's scaring me too, ma.

55:08.072 --> 55:11.508
But Jill's parents
don't see it that way!

55:11.509 --> 55:14.544
They think because we're from
two different walks of life,

55:14.545 --> 55:16.446
I'm from the streets,
she's from the suburbs,

55:16.447 --> 55:17.681
we don't mix!

55:17.682 --> 55:20.817
They're doing everything
to break us apart, ma!

55:20.818 --> 55:22.987
I can't take this anymore!

55:24.021 --> 55:25.221
- Look.

55:25.222 --> 55:28.124
It's the heart that counts.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.593
- That's what you
always told me, ma.

55:29.594 --> 55:30.760
- Yes.

55:30.761 --> 55:31.761
- I love you, ma.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.763
- I love you too.

55:33.764 --> 55:35.765
It'll work out.

55:41.272 --> 55:43.508
- It's open, come in!

55:45.410 --> 55:46.411
- Hey, Pink.

55:48.446 --> 55:50.480
This is Detective Carter.

55:50.481 --> 55:52.549
She'll be escorting
you to your safe haven.

55:52.550 --> 55:53.750
- How are you doing?

55:53.751 --> 55:55.552
I work for Task in part
of the Ops Division.

55:55.553 --> 55:57.020
I'll be transporting you.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.690
- And I believe you remember MV.

56:00.825 --> 56:01.991
- Hey.

56:01.992 --> 56:02.993
Remember me?

56:04.795 --> 56:08.465
I see you've been
pretty busy, Pink.

56:08.466 --> 56:09.499
- Wait.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.167
You're not a carjacker?

56:11.168 --> 56:12.402
This is crazy.

56:12.403 --> 56:15.071
And you're telling me
that you screwed up.

56:15.072 --> 56:16.139
- That means I did my job.

56:16.140 --> 56:17.407
See, I was there to protect you

56:17.408 --> 56:19.643
because you are the
Congressman's daughter.

56:19.644 --> 56:21.144
That doctor you shoot,

56:21.145 --> 56:23.413
he was there to turn
in your state evidence.

56:23.414 --> 56:25.281
- Against who?

56:25.282 --> 56:26.783
This all sounds like a setup.

56:26.784 --> 56:28.284
- I can't discuss that!

56:28.285 --> 56:29.453
Hurry up!

56:29.454 --> 56:30.820
We need to get out of here!

56:30.821 --> 56:32.055
- I'm almost packed.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.289
Where are you taking me?

56:33.290 --> 56:35.158
- We're taking you
to a secret location

56:35.159 --> 56:37.794
where the Chinese
won't find you.

56:37.795 --> 56:40.263
- Let me get this
straight for the record.

56:40.264 --> 56:42.499
My dad, the Congressman,

56:42.500 --> 56:44.333
I'm getting
kidnapped for ransom?

56:44.334 --> 56:46.603
- This is a lot more
complicated than you think.

56:46.604 --> 56:47.804
We are not to discuss

56:47.805 --> 56:49.272
anything from the
headquarters, period,

56:49.273 --> 56:51.341
not their motives or why.

56:52.342 --> 56:53.710
- I don't like sometimes we do.

56:53.711 --> 56:55.712
But I guess I don't
have a choice, do I?

56:55.713 --> 56:57.180
- Everyone always has a choice.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.115
Either you go or you stay.

56:59.116 --> 57:01.451
And chances are, if
you stay, you're dead.

57:01.452 --> 57:03.152
- I'll be taking
that, thank you.

57:03.153 --> 57:04.454
- Well I hope you're ready.

57:04.455 --> 57:05.689
We have a long trip ahead of us,

57:05.690 --> 57:08.726
and we will be using
multiple vehicles.

57:11.496 --> 57:12.496
- Jill.

57:13.363 --> 57:15.164
- What?
- We need to talk.

57:15.165 --> 57:16.466
- About what?

57:16.467 --> 57:17.701
I don't really have
time for this, mom.

57:17.702 --> 57:18.636
- You better make time,

57:18.637 --> 57:21.304
because this is important.

57:21.305 --> 57:24.808
- Do I even want to hear
what you're gonna say?

57:24.809 --> 57:27.777
Am I staying or am I going?

57:27.778 --> 57:30.980
- You're staying
on one condition.

57:30.981 --> 57:32.916
- There's always a condition.

57:32.917 --> 57:34.183
- Listen, you're gonna
go see a friend of mine

57:34.184 --> 57:35.685
in rehab clinic.

57:35.686 --> 57:37.421
You need to get help.

57:38.523 --> 57:39.856
- Really?

57:39.857 --> 57:41.090
This is the best news

57:41.091 --> 57:45.996
I've heard
in a really long time.

57:47.164 --> 57:48.765
ENJ's gonna be so
happy.

57:48.766 --> 57:49.600
- Are you kidding me?

57:49.600 --> 57:50.535
ENJ?

57:50.535 --> 57:51.268
I thought you weren't with him.

57:51.269 --> 57:52.536
What's going on?

57:52.537 --> 57:53.937
- Our band just got
a major record deal.

57:53.938 --> 57:54.872
- Our band?

57:54.873 --> 57:55.873
That's not even your band!

57:55.873 --> 57:56.707
That's his band!

57:56.708 --> 57:58.007
- It's our band.

57:58.008 --> 58:00.076
- Jill, you need to stop
focusing on this music

58:00.077 --> 58:01.310
and you need to get better.

58:01.311 --> 58:02.746
Do you understand
you need to get help?

58:02.747 --> 58:04.180
- This is what I need for help!

58:04.181 --> 58:05.314
I love him!

58:05.315 --> 58:06.449
- I don't really care, Jill.

58:06.450 --> 58:08.184
Forget about this music.

58:08.185 --> 58:10.186
You're gonna focus on
getting better and that's it.

58:10.187 --> 58:11.354
Do you understand?

58:11.355 --> 58:12.789
- I don't have
time for this, mom!

58:12.790 --> 58:14.724
- Well you'd better make time!

58:14.725 --> 58:17.193
You're lucky I didn't
send you away, Jill!

58:17.194 --> 58:19.996
- Remember, the department
was investigated,

58:19.997 --> 58:21.230
including the heads,

58:21.231 --> 58:23.032
and they were all under fire.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.267
- This case is different.

58:24.268 --> 58:26.970
We are dealing with a
Congressman's daughter.

58:26.971 --> 58:29.072
It's grounds for
termination if we screw up.

58:29.073 --> 58:30.907
- Hold on one second.

58:30.908 --> 58:33.076
- It's a green
light, so we can pull up.

58:33.077 --> 58:34.310
- I've just been informed that

58:34.311 --> 58:35.679
they're gonna start
bringing her out now.

58:35.680 --> 58:37.080
Hey, you should
run for Congress.

58:37.081 --> 58:39.348
- Who knows, maybe I will.

58:39.349 --> 58:40.184
Come on.

58:40.185 --> 58:42.451
Let's go get ready to go

58:42.452 --> 58:43.953
at 0800 hours.

59:14.719 --> 59:15.552
- Run!

59:15.552 --> 59:16.486
Come on, let's go!

59:16.486 --> 59:17.387
Move!

59:17.387 --> 59:18.222
- Move it, move it!

59:18.222 --> 59:19.156
Hurry up!

59:19.157 --> 59:20.790
Let's go, let's go, move it!

59:40.410 --> 59:41.444
Let's go!

59:41.445 --> 59:42.445
Hurry!

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.903
- Back where it all began.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:09.073
What happened to your leg?

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:12.508
- Don't worry about it.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:14.711
Be fine tomorrow.

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:17.313
- Those screens that you
were questioning me about

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.882
on your computers,

01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:22.752
that said "Elite
accepting connection,"

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.587
there'll be one more screen.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:28.124
It's gonna say "Elite
terminating connection."

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:31.828
That was Detective Alvarez,
our computer specialist,

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:34.563
who was buying us
time with the Chinese

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.033
to get Pink out of harm's way.

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:39.769
- I didn't know,
and I don't care.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.504
- You and your team

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:44.074
are exonerated from all charges

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.111
because you cooperated
with the government.

01:00:48.112 --> 01:00:50.613
♪ I'm looking in the mirror

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:53.282
- Certain things have
to stay confidential.

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.518
Tomorrow, stage two,

01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:57.353
the final stage,

01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:59.856
will go into effect
on the party boat.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:01.825
Ops did a great job

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:05.329
planting those homing
devices on the boat.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:07.931
Trust me,

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:09.966
the Chinese were watching.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:11.468
We threw them off.

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:14.537
- What do you want
my team to do?

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:15.638
- Nothing.

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.374
You let us handle it.

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.444
The Congressman is
pleased with your work.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.546
He wanted me to let you know

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:26.483
that Jill is gonna
be getting help.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:28.684
- I love Jill.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.219
- I know you do.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.922
Maybe now you and her
can have a life together

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:36.059
because you chose your
life and not the streets.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.895
You could be a
musician, an activist,

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.396
a politician.

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:42.031
Who knows, you might
even be a director

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.100
like Eddie Rocky Rivera.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:46.569
Life plays out like a movie.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.139
You got your whole
life in front of you.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.675
I'll see you tomorrow
on that party boat.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:55.678
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:56.679
- Hey wait.

01:01:58.115 --> 01:02:00.249
Hey, by the way.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.250
- What?

01:02:02.787 --> 01:02:04.954
- Tell Congressman Lee Russo

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:08.724
I wanted to just say
I knew he would win.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.193
- You got it, kid.

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:11.194
Be safe.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:18.836
- That's the guy with the car.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:19.669
That's the guy.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:20.637
- Are you sure?

01:02:20.638 --> 01:02:22.305
- She's not on the go.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:23.840
- As you all know,

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:26.509
we're about to embark on a
mission against the Elite.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:29.512
- At what time will we
be striking the compound?

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.881
- Striking time
is at 1800 hours.

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:34.784
We will be accompanied by three
of the Ops Division members,

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:38.254
Detective Schwartz, Detective
McCain, and Detective Bonanno.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.956
All that has already
played a role

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.425
by planting their homing
device in the boat.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.493
- Detective Rivera will
be running a little late.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.529
He'll like to know who'll
be riding with him.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.364
- Rivera will be riding with me,

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.534
McClain, Brown, with Mike.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:54.170
- So Schwartz and I will
be under the Escalades,

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:55.939
and will we be behind you?

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.573
- We're gonna go to the left.

01:02:57.574 --> 01:02:59.809
You guys are gonna
flank to the right.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.611
Make sure you use your
bulletproof vests,

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.814
because we don't
know what can happen

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:06.816
and what we're getting
ourselves into.

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:08.484
- Can I ask you a question?

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:09.319
- Sure, go ahead.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.887
What's your question?

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:13.022
- Should I go straight at Red?

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.825
He wields his gun
around right away.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.360
- Yes.

01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:20.930
Make sure that we surround
the perimeter of the boat.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:23.532
- I take it Detective Alvarez
and I will be staying behind

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:25.334
to monitor the computers.

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:26.602
- Exactly.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:27.770
- Yeah.

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:29.138
- Have you been
researching the intel?

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.706
- Yes, we have.

01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:34.077
- You know, it hasn't been easy.

01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:35.845
- Police work is never easy.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.047
That's why we do what we do.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:42.051
If there's no further questions,
this briefing is concluded.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.552
Everybody be safe out there.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:44.488
- Thanks, guys.

01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:45.688
- All right, be safe out there.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:47.357
- Stay out of sight.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:16.053
- Put your hands up and freeze!

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.355
Nobody move!

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.368
- Hello?

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.270
- She's not on the boat.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:37.040
- What do you mean
she's not on the boat?

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:38.607
- Look around.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.045
She might be on another boat.

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:46.182
- My father is gonna kill you!

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:49.085
- The boss is not
gonna be happy.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:55.058
- I just said she
is not on the boat.

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.360
- I've just heard it, okay!

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.861
She's not on the boat.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:03.266
- Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.201
How could she disappear?

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:06.535
She has to be there!

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.105
- Somebody might
have tipped them off!

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:10.674
Now what do we do?!

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:15.911
- How could she slip
out of our hands?

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.147
- I don't know.

01:05:18.882 --> 01:05:20.116
- You go find her.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:22.685
You go fucking find her!

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:30.293
- I'm not shouting, asshole!

01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:31.694
I hate you guys!

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.029
- Hands up!
- Hands in the air!

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.531
- Hate to
destroy your day, Red,

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:38.167
but I told you that we
were gonna bring you in.

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:39.902
T.J, grab him, cuff him.

01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:42.271
- Nah man, for real.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.439
- Yo!

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.673
Whoa!

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:49.412
- How the fuck you
running with us that long?

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:50.247
You're a cop?!
- You have the right

01:05:50.248 --> 01:05:51.480
to remain silent!

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.416
- Fuck your rights!
- Anything you say can

01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:53.816
and will be used against you.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:54.984
- Put your hands in the air.
- Fuck your rights!

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:55.985
- Hands in the air!
- Don't move!

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:57.220
- Fuck you!
- Yeah, man.

01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.155
- Yo, y'all ain't
got shit on me!

01:05:58.156 --> 01:05:59.822
I just got released from jail!

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:00.856
- Chill, dude.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:01.957
- Hands in the air.
- Hey!

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.192
- Do you remember me?

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:05.494
- Of course I
remember you, asshole.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:06.762
- I remember you!

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:08.764
I brought you in last time.

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:11.067
We have Pink in custody.
- On your knees!

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:11.901
- That's
where she's at?

01:06:11.902 --> 01:06:13.902
- Shut up!

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.271
- Fuck you.

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:16.905
- Shut up!

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:21.911
- All you guys are arrested
for murders and carjacking.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:23.779
- Okay, I got nothing!

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780
I'm clean!

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:25.682
I didn't do nothing!

01:06:25.683 --> 01:06:26.750
I'm innocent!

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:33.790
- You have the right
to an attorney.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:34.724
If you cannot afford one,

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:35.925
one will be appointed for you.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.097
- I didn't jack no car.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:42.331
- Yeah, okay.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.533
You tell that to the guy
at the station house.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:45.668
- Carjacking, hey boy,

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:46.603
you are carjacking?

01:06:46.604 --> 01:06:47.770
- They ain't got nothing on us.

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:50.174
- Shut up!
- They got nothing.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.543
- A leak from the inside.

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:55.978
- Hey Tony, I'm
taking care of that.

01:06:55.979 --> 01:06:58.181
Lorenzo called me.

01:06:58.182 --> 01:06:59.682
- Good.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.417
- Tracy, can you get that
bottle of Rue from the back?

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.418
- Sure.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.880
- Gun!

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.123
- Bitch.

01:07:40.124 --> 01:07:41.424
- Now go clean it up, boys.

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.991
- Yeah, whatevs.

01:07:51.335 --> 01:07:52.568
- Detective Lorenzo
has played it out

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.137
to at least every move.

01:07:54.138 --> 01:07:55.671
- Yes.

01:07:55.672 --> 01:07:57.106
Lorenzo's pretty amazing?

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:59.175
Get on to one targeted
multiple ones,

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:01.076
they're just done for, you know?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.345
- Yeah.

01:08:02.346 --> 01:08:04.980
- Hey, you want to
go out to dinner?

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:06.549
- I told you you were
too young for me,

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.750
but what the heck?

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.017
I'm not having much luck
with the older guys,

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.187
so I'll accept your invitation.

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:12.122
- Great.

01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:12.922
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.158
- Sounds great.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.966
- It's over.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.401
Your daughter's safe and sound.

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:26.969
- She's safe?

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.604
- But you're not
gonna see her anymore.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.807
She's in the Witness
Protection Program.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.975
No more April Russo.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:34.977
- My Pink.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:36.979
I,

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.180
I didn't,

01:08:38.182 --> 01:08:39.782
I, I, I didn't get a chance--

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.084
- Intelligence
reported back that

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:45.220
the Chinese mob was
gonna abduct her,

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:47.724
so it was either now or never.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:52.328
And Detective Raul,

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.397
that day that I
went to his house,

01:08:54.398 --> 01:08:56.131
I opened up the door,

01:08:57.334 --> 01:09:00.703
and he was hanging
with his own belt.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:03.071
He finished the job for me.

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:06.041
And let's not forget when
I went to Freddy's shop.

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.544
I sent Detective Brown home,

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:11.680
then I went to the park to play.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.683
- Raul, a
chump to the end.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.151
We set him up good.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.621
Nobody figured that
you had offed his wife.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:19.854
That investigator--

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:20.923
- Hi, are you Heather?

01:09:20.924 --> 01:09:22.625
- I got her that job.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:23.460
- I'm Detective Lorenzo.
- And then she was gonna

01:09:23.461 --> 01:09:25.328
use it to blackmail me!

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.529
How's that for attitude?
- She helped us

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.331
take care of business.

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:32.134
That day, when I put the
bomb underneath her car,

01:09:32.135 --> 01:09:35.203
all the evidence pointed to ENJ.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.310
That was enough to make
him and his team cooperate.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:46.849
- The only leverage I had was
to threaten to take Jill away.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.451
You're a clever man, Detective.

01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:49.853
- And so are you.

01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:53.522
- And you're a well-paid one.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.123
Here's the 50 as agreed,

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:57.660
plus you have another 50
coming to you as a bonus.

01:09:57.661 --> 01:09:58.661
- What's up?

01:09:58.662 --> 01:09:59.529
- The Chinese.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:00.963
Look.

01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:03.966
I'm chairman of the
Congressional Trade Committee.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:07.636
The Chinese mob believes
that our crew is behind bars,

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:09.772
so they think that
they can pimp me out

01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:12.074
to their government
trade delegation,

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:14.109
and what I want is
their government's

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.479
submarine silence technology

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.014
that our navy is
concerned about,

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:23.753
but the Chinese mob is about
to throw a kink in our plans

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.556
and screw up our payday.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:28.492
Check.

01:10:28.493 --> 01:10:29.725
- What is it to say

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.461
that the rook wouldn't
take out the queen?

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:35.299
What's stopping you?

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.000
- Here we go again.

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:43.606
- Fuck with Tony?

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.277
Die, motherfucker!

01:11:08.332 --> 01:11:09.498
- I know it was painful

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.303
to have somebody
else raise your son.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.705
He chose his life

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:18.408
