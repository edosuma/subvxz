00:09.373 --> 00:11.621
306, do you copy?

00:13.040 --> 00:16.315
212, this is 306. I've got you.

00:16.415 --> 00:18.690
Everybody's gone.

00:18.790 --> 00:20.731
Did you get that?

00:20.831 --> 00:23.315
212, do you copy?

00:25.290 --> 00:28.315
Hi, Mum. It's Bernard.

00:28.415 --> 00:32.314
It's pretty scary. I'm OK.
I hope you and Dad are too.

00:32.415 --> 00:35.190
Hey, it's me. I don't know if
you've heard the news yet.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.273
I'm just at work.
They're telling me not to leave.

00:37.373 --> 00:38.815
I don't know what to do.

00:38.915 --> 00:42.106
I just hope you get home safely.

00:42.206 --> 00:44.648
Hey, kiddo. It's your dad.

00:44.748 --> 00:46.773
I'm looking forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

00:46.873 --> 00:48.981
Just want you to know
I'm thinking about you

00:49.081 --> 00:51.440
and I can't wait to give you a big hug.

00:51.540 --> 00:53.523
It's crazy, dude!
Can you at least call back?

00:53.623 --> 00:55.398
I'm totally freaking out right now.

00:55.498 --> 00:57.951
I love you. I love you. I love you.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.231
You can survive this thing.

02:04.331 --> 02:07.315
Just get out of the city and
stay away from the coast.

02:07.415 --> 02:09.815
I told you we were gonna
fuckin' die from heat.

02:09.914 --> 02:11.856
We're totally gonna die.

02:11.956 --> 02:14.648
Please, can anybody hear me?
Please respond.

02:16.665 --> 02:19.835
God, he loves you!

02:28.206 --> 02:32.616
This is VK6DF checking in
for the first time today.

02:33.831 --> 02:37.490
Is there anybody out there? Over.

02:40.915 --> 02:44.324
Here it is, folks. It's happened.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.705
Approximate location of impact,
the North Atlantic.

02:50.665 --> 02:56.827
Approximate time of impact
at 7:30am Perth time...

02:58.331 --> 03:00.440
- ...which was...
- Thy kingdom come.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.038
...10 minutes ago.

03:24.290 --> 03:27.523
I just hope you're all
keeping safe out there,

03:27.623 --> 03:29.273
you're surrounded by your families...

03:30.323 --> 03:34.125
- Fuck off.
...friends, looking after each other.

03:36.290 --> 03:40.023
The eastern coastline of North
America has been affected.

03:40.123 --> 03:42.898
Also the West African coastline.

03:42.998 --> 03:46.407
As of now, all of western Europe's gone.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.163
It's gone.

03:53.498 --> 03:56.577
As I speak to you right now...

03:58.123 --> 04:00.606
it's making its way
towards our fair nation.

04:00.706 --> 04:02.829
Stop! Stop, please!

04:03.956 --> 04:06.784
It's not too late to change your mind.

04:14.748 --> 04:16.606
Be a great view from here.

04:31.498 --> 04:35.356
There's no shame in checking
out ahead of time, folks.

04:35.456 --> 04:37.283
You gotta do what you gotta do.

04:41.331 --> 04:45.231
It's here. It's real.

04:45.331 --> 04:48.000
We're already fucking dead.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.870
It's gonna fucking hurt.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.369
And I don't want to feel it.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.916
I don't want to feel a thing.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.993
Just want to get fucked up.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.273
No.

05:17.373 --> 05:18.815
Go to your party.

05:18.915 --> 05:21.664
Fuck your girlfriend.

05:24.623 --> 05:29.829
You could forget about... all of this.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.409
We have 12 hours, people.

05:36.998 --> 05:39.246
That's all.

06:04.915 --> 06:06.898
- Go, go, go! Turn around!
- Fuck!

06:06.998 --> 06:08.940
- What are you...?
- Get on with your fuckin' day!

06:09.040 --> 06:12.619
Come on! Fuck me dead!

06:15.123 --> 06:16.856
- Take the fucking car.
- Come on! Move it!

06:16.956 --> 06:18.703
- Go easy!
- Come on!

06:25.165 --> 06:27.868
He burnt me!

06:29.081 --> 06:31.023
Idiots!

06:31.123 --> 06:34.690
Fuckin' foil! And they call me crazy.

06:34.790 --> 06:38.356
They'll be the first to go,
down in their bunkers, waiting.

06:38.456 --> 06:41.231
Like fuckin' beef in a stew.
Fuckin' beef in a crockpot.

06:41.331 --> 06:43.909
There's just no telling
some people, is there?

06:48.331 --> 06:50.690
- I said, fuckin' is there?!
- No, mate.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.481
There he is.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.565
Stop here! Stop, stop, stop!
Give us the keys!

06:56.665 --> 06:59.356
Give us the fuckin' keys!
Give us the fuckin' keys!

06:59.456 --> 07:01.315
I got some errands to
take care of, alright?

07:01.415 --> 07:03.148
Like, I shouldn't be
driving in my condition.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.898
You just fuckin' try me!

07:04.998 --> 07:07.106
You won't believe how fast I can run!

07:17.790 --> 07:20.981
- Shit!
- Oi!

07:21.081 --> 07:23.690
What did I fuckin' say?

07:29.956 --> 07:31.499
Hey!

07:35.040 --> 07:37.413
Fuck me dead.

07:40.498 --> 07:43.292
Hey! Hey! Hey!

07:46.415 --> 07:50.040
- Hey, where are you going?
- Piss off!

08:02.790 --> 08:04.663
Come here!

08:18.748 --> 08:20.950
Come on.

08:22.206 --> 08:23.856
Here, kitty, kitty.

08:32.623 --> 08:34.648
Hey! Hey, come here!

09:14.081 --> 09:17.565
Put me down! Please. I just want my dad.

09:17.665 --> 09:21.481
Let me go. Somebody help!

09:21.581 --> 09:25.940
Please, I just want my dad.
Help me, please!

09:33.081 --> 09:35.648
Please help! Someone!

09:38.165 --> 09:40.773
- Somebody help me, please!
- Shut up!

09:50.956 --> 09:53.815
I said, shut up in there!

09:53.915 --> 09:55.773
Give us some bloody peace and quiet.

09:55.873 --> 09:57.815
- Let me out!
- Quiet!

10:02.373 --> 10:04.541
What are you talking about?

10:07.290 --> 10:10.481
I said shut up! Jesus Christ!

10:13.873 --> 10:17.407
We're not fucking around!

10:18.831 --> 10:21.315
Let me out! Please!

10:30.665 --> 10:33.199
Please let me out of here!

10:37.665 --> 10:39.190
Please!

10:40.824 --> 10:42.990
Let me out of here.

10:44.706 --> 10:47.375
Please! Let me out of here!

11:39.581 --> 11:41.648
- Let me out of here!
- Hey!

11:41.748 --> 11:44.497
There's enough of her for both of us.

11:53.831 --> 11:55.356
Help!

11:55.456 --> 11:57.156
Help!

11:58.665 --> 12:02.039
It's OK. Let's get out of here.

12:07.998 --> 12:10.075
Get in the van.

12:11.581 --> 12:13.773
Hey!

12:13.873 --> 12:15.981
I don't know these men.
I'm just taking their van.

12:16.081 --> 12:18.440
What? What?

12:18.540 --> 12:20.898
I want my dad.

12:20.998 --> 12:23.292
Listen! It's just not safe here!
Get in the van!

12:25.206 --> 12:28.023
Please. Please.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.451
Please.

12:41.873 --> 12:43.815
They said they'd help me find Dad,

12:43.915 --> 12:45.690
but they... they went a different way.

12:45.790 --> 12:48.398
They said it was a short cut.

12:48.498 --> 12:50.731
He's 42. He's got black hair.

12:50.831 --> 12:53.023
- I need some water.
- He was looking for some petrol.

12:53.123 --> 12:55.606
- Maybe you've seen him.
- Shush! Can you just...

12:55.706 --> 12:58.284
ls there any water?

13:02.123 --> 13:04.291
There's this.

13:06.165 --> 13:10.040
You shouldn't drink and drive.
It's dangerous.

13:14.665 --> 13:17.731
- Where do you live?
- Dad burnt our house down.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.023
He said he didn't want anyone
breaking in and living there.

13:20.123 --> 13:22.065
Oh, fuck.

13:22.165 --> 13:24.148
Said the house memories were
our memories, no-one else's.

13:24.248 --> 13:27.773
- So he set it on fire.
- Well...

13:27.873 --> 13:30.023
Where'd you last see your dad?

13:30.123 --> 13:32.940
When we ran out of petrol
on the way to Aunty Janice's.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.940
Told me to hide while
he found some more.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.898
No, there's gotta be
somewhere I can leave ya.

13:36.998 --> 13:41.481
- Everyone's at Aunty Janice's.
- Where's that?

13:41.581 --> 13:43.023
In Roleystone.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.122
No, no, no, no, no.

13:49.915 --> 13:52.773
Maybe Dad's back at
the car, looking for me.

13:52.873 --> 13:56.065
- In Malaga.
- Malaga?

13:57.564 --> 14:00.083
Yeah. You know where the ice rink is?

14:05.665 --> 14:08.084
Oi!

14:11.123 --> 14:12.648
Oi!

14:12.748 --> 14:15.076
Shut up!

14:22.415 --> 14:24.617
They're shooting again.

14:36.831 --> 14:38.783
Canada.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.913
Mexico.

14:42.998 --> 14:44.825
Central America.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.690
Gone.

14:49.331 --> 14:50.773
10 hours, folks.

14:51.316 --> 14:53.539
- Dad! Dad!
- Over.

14:55.331 --> 14:56.572
Dad!

14:58.040 --> 15:00.398
- Dad!
- Fuck.

15:00.498 --> 15:02.315
- He's not here.
- Dad!

15:02.415 --> 15:04.190
- Dad!
- That's enough.

15:04.290 --> 15:07.073
- Dad!
- Hey, it's enough. He's not here.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.731
He's not here.

15:10.531 --> 15:12.023
Fuck.

15:12.123 --> 15:15.148
Well, then... he must
be at Aunty Janice's.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.731
He said if we ever got separated
that we should meet there.

15:18.831 --> 15:20.658
Great.

15:21.831 --> 15:23.954
This is what he looks like.

15:28.665 --> 15:30.690
Where's your mum?

15:30.790 --> 15:32.663
She died.

15:36.581 --> 15:38.328
I've gotta get going.

15:39.956 --> 15:41.773
Well... maybe you could
take me to my aunt's.

15:41.873 --> 15:44.315
I've got hardly enough petrol
to get where I'm going.

15:44.415 --> 15:47.243
Well, there'll be petrol at my aunt's.

15:50.915 --> 15:54.898
My sister lives near here.
You'll like her. She's nice.

15:54.998 --> 15:58.565
She has three little girls.
You'll be safe there, alright?

15:58.665 --> 16:00.538
Come on. We're going.

16:04.206 --> 16:06.784
I need to be with my
dad when it happens.

16:29.290 --> 16:31.208
Wait!

16:49.415 --> 16:51.242
I'm Rose.

16:52.873 --> 16:55.167
James.

17:06.665 --> 17:08.565
This is VK6DF checking in

17:08.665 --> 17:10.742
for the sixth time today.

17:13.498 --> 17:16.690
My mother, she said that...

17:16.790 --> 17:20.065
science always had it over religion,

17:20.165 --> 17:25.040
and right up to this point,
I always believed that.

17:26.415 --> 17:28.440
But I don't know.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.606
Funny how you can turn to God

17:32.706 --> 17:35.659
when you got no real faith in him.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.163
Stace! It's Jimmy!

18:13.484 --> 18:15.910
Stace!

18:17.706 --> 18:19.954
It's not Christmas.

18:54.831 --> 18:56.815
Why don't you go for a swim in the pool?

18:56.915 --> 18:59.815
- I'm gonna look upstairs.
- But I don't have my bathers.

18:59.915 --> 19:03.085
- Just go in your dress.
- Really?

21:18.415 --> 21:20.913
So where's your sister?

21:25.665 --> 21:27.583
She's not here.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.371
Where are you going?

21:40.498 --> 21:42.106
Party.

21:42.206 --> 21:44.454
Big party.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.898
Maybe someone at the party
can take me to Aunty Janice's.

22:32.623 --> 22:34.791
How'd you find this place anyway?

22:35.956 --> 22:38.124
We used to come here when I was little.

22:39.123 --> 22:41.121
I feel safe here.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.565
Listen, Zo,

22:46.665 --> 22:49.523
I know you're for keeping your
wits about you when it happens,

22:49.623 --> 22:52.856
but, fuck, you sure you
won't take something?

22:52.956 --> 22:55.398
Like, something to take
the edge off a little?

22:55.498 --> 22:58.065
Hey, come on, Zoe. You said...

22:58.165 --> 23:01.190
Hey. You said you wouldn't do that.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.065
Come on.

23:03.165 --> 23:05.459
It was... I just...

23:08.456 --> 23:10.704
- Oh...
- Please.

23:11.915 --> 23:13.833
I just...

23:14.998 --> 23:16.745
What?

23:19.581 --> 23:22.079
I'm pregnant, James.

23:25.498 --> 23:26.940
You took a test or something?

23:27.040 --> 23:30.824
I wanted to know. I needed to be sure.

23:33.915 --> 23:35.731
I mean, what difference does it make?

23:58.581 --> 24:00.523
What do you think?

24:00.623 --> 24:03.827
A little boy or a little girl?

24:06.706 --> 24:08.453
Hey?

24:16.915 --> 24:18.833
I don't know.

24:19.956 --> 24:21.703
Boy.

24:25.831 --> 24:31.242
He would have been handsome,
just like his dad.

24:33.331 --> 24:35.606
This is bullshit. Fuck.

24:35.706 --> 24:38.034
This is bullshit.
You shouldn't have told me.

24:38.998 --> 24:42.440
- Where the fuck are my keys?
- Stay here with me, James.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.606
Why? And stare out into the
fucking ocean waiting for it?

24:45.706 --> 24:47.148
There's still time!

24:47.248 --> 24:48.898
What fucking difference does it make?

24:48.998 --> 24:51.292
We're already fucking dead!

24:53.665 --> 24:55.742
We're already fucking dead.

24:57.373 --> 24:59.190
It's gonna hurt a lot.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.868
And I don't want to feel it.

25:03.206 --> 25:05.784
I don't want to feel a thing.

25:06.665 --> 25:08.708
Hey.

25:10.665 --> 25:13.869
Life is stronger than death, James.

25:17.331 --> 25:19.065
I can't.

25:19.165 --> 25:22.744
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:23.706 --> 25:25.783
I just want to get fucked up.

25:56.373 --> 25:58.606
You know, Dad says when it happens,

25:58.706 --> 26:00.273
the earth's gonna peel like an orange

26:00.373 --> 26:02.291
but the peel is made out of fire.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.367
Didn't sugar-coat it for you, did he?

26:20.540 --> 26:22.868
This'll stop the bleeding.

26:38.081 --> 26:41.455
You ever think you might end
up in hell instead of heaven?

26:43.956 --> 26:46.033
That'd be awful.

26:53.581 --> 26:57.411
Sometimes I worry, though,
I'm going to hell instead.

27:01.123 --> 27:03.417
Why do you think you
might end up in hell?

27:07.373 --> 27:09.106
There was this girl in my class.

27:09.206 --> 27:12.106
She used to tease me all the time.

27:12.206 --> 27:16.106
One day last year, I prayed
to God that she would die.

27:16.206 --> 27:20.190
She died just before this
year's sports carnival.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.959
She'd gotten leukaemia.

27:28.331 --> 27:34.459
I don't think her getting cancer
had anything to do with you.

27:35.290 --> 27:37.773
Or you praying to God.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.201
It just happens.

27:41.998 --> 27:44.917
Some people get sick
and some people don't.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.565
But Dad always said that God
has a perfect plan for everyone

27:49.665 --> 27:52.163
and that plan never fails.

27:53.248 --> 27:55.148
Well, if this was God's perfect plan,

27:55.248 --> 27:57.701
then he was a real fucking idiot.

28:02.456 --> 28:05.398
- I want to go home!
- Come on, Jane.

28:05.498 --> 28:07.690
- Get out of the car.
- Come on.

28:07.790 --> 28:09.398
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

28:09.498 --> 28:11.245
Just grab your bag.

28:20.290 --> 28:23.699
No! No!

28:25.456 --> 28:27.773
- Oh, please, just listen.
- Hey.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.815
- It's very important.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:30.915 --> 28:33.231
This girl's lost.
Can I leave her with you?

28:33.331 --> 28:36.455
Gary, for God's sake.
Get them out of here.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.492
Gary, please!

28:40.415 --> 28:42.993
- Can we go, James?
- Yeah, come on.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.523
- Sorry.
- Wait.

28:46.623 --> 28:48.565
Can I talk to you, just for a sec?

28:48.665 --> 28:51.334
- Please.
- What?

28:54.748 --> 28:56.481
Please. Just sit down.

28:56.581 --> 28:59.751
OK. Just go read a
book over there, Rose.

29:01.956 --> 29:03.565
What? What do you want?

29:03.665 --> 29:07.449
Hayley, please sit down.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.856
I've tried to do what's right.
But I can't anymore.

29:12.956 --> 29:17.440
I love 'em too much.
I can't watch 'em suffer like this.

29:17.540 --> 29:21.356
- What sort of dad would I be?
- Hayley, get back here!

29:21.456 --> 29:24.910
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Sweetheart, come back. Gary!

29:25.790 --> 29:27.833
You listen to Mummy, please.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.981
Could you do it? Clean,
right in the back of their heads.

29:34.081 --> 29:36.065
- No.
- Please!

29:36.165 --> 29:38.190
I've got a picture book.
I'll read it to them.

29:38.290 --> 29:40.565
You just do it. Clean.
Right in the back of their heads.

29:40.665 --> 29:43.690
They won't feel a thing,
and then it'll be over.

29:43.790 --> 29:46.163
There's four bullets in there,
one for each of us.

29:47.373 --> 29:49.065
- No.
- Please. Please.

29:49.165 --> 29:50.708
No!

29:51.998 --> 29:54.121
Then forgive me, then.

29:55.081 --> 29:58.410
Forgive me... for what I gotta do.

30:02.206 --> 30:03.532
Say it.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.416
Say you forgive me.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.287
Say it.

30:14.831 --> 30:16.908
I forgive you.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.457
Rose?

30:37.831 --> 30:39.123
Come on.

31:03.331 --> 31:06.023
I hope you're looking after
yourselves out there,

31:06.123 --> 31:08.190
and each other.

31:08.290 --> 31:12.825
These are the things we gotta hold onto.

31:18.665 --> 31:20.565
When it reaches us here in Perth,

31:20.665 --> 31:24.523
I know for a fact that
I can sit here and go,

31:24.623 --> 31:30.409
"I had my faults, but...
but I was a good man."

31:57.415 --> 31:59.523
Hello, Freddy?

32:00.023 --> 32:02.106
Oi, Freddy, it's James.

32:02.206 --> 32:06.273
- Who's that, man?
- It's Jimmy. Open up the gate!

32:06.373 --> 32:10.231
Jimmy! Where you been, man?

32:10.331 --> 32:12.773
Vicky's mega-pissed, dude.

32:12.873 --> 32:15.326
Just open up the gate,
will you, dickhead?

32:16.623 --> 32:19.372
- Is Vicky your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

32:20.456 --> 32:21.898
Well, why is she mad at you?

32:21.998 --> 32:23.731
'Cause I should have been here earlier!

32:29.456 --> 32:30.981
Bloody hell.

32:44.165 --> 32:45.662
Hey. Jimmy!

33:18.040 --> 33:20.606
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,

33:20.706 --> 33:24.981
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot,

33:25.081 --> 33:27.815
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,

33:27.915 --> 33:31.856
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot...

33:34.873 --> 33:38.190
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,

33:38.290 --> 33:39.731
shoot, shoot, shoot...

34:04.873 --> 34:07.952
Fuck yeah!

34:12.540 --> 34:15.065
Jimmy, you mad fuck!

34:15.165 --> 34:17.815
You look like shit, man.
Bring it in, dickhead.

34:17.915 --> 34:19.898
- Where's Vicky?
- Hey, man.

34:19.998 --> 34:22.690
Can you believe I thought no-one
was gonna come to my party, man?

34:22.790 --> 34:25.356
Just look at these fuckers.
They're just going off, man.

34:25.456 --> 34:27.523
They're just... You know what I mean?
They're getting fucked.

34:27.623 --> 34:30.898
Oh! And they're just
loving each other, man.

34:30.998 --> 34:33.523
They're just aiming life the
way they want to have life!

34:33.623 --> 34:36.481
- Where's Vicky?
- Who the fuck are you?

34:36.581 --> 34:39.023
Oi! Where's Vicky?

34:39.123 --> 34:42.898
Jesus! I don't know. Fuck!
She's gotta be fuckin' somewhere.

34:42.998 --> 34:46.106
You should find her.
She doesn't like being left alone.

34:46.206 --> 34:48.773
She's somewhere, man.
You'd better fuckin' find her, man!

34:48.873 --> 34:51.606
- I know!
- Oi! Oi.

34:51.706 --> 34:54.315
It's done. Downstairs.

34:54.415 --> 34:56.773
It's fuckin' done,
and it's beautiful, Jim.

34:56.873 --> 35:00.315
You wait till you see it, man.
Don't tell anybody.

35:00.415 --> 35:03.523
Just keep it on the down low. Just...

35:03.623 --> 35:05.791
Alright?

35:06.915 --> 35:09.083
Fuck yeah!

35:11.331 --> 35:16.273
Hey, Jimmy! You made it. Nice one, bro!

35:16.373 --> 35:19.815
James, I don't think anyone here
will take me to Aunty Janice's.

35:19.915 --> 35:21.356
- It's me, baby.
- Move.

35:21.456 --> 35:23.065
Where are you going?

35:23.165 --> 35:24.815
Is there anything to eat?

35:24.915 --> 35:26.856
Fuck!

35:26.956 --> 35:28.440
Here.

35:28.540 --> 35:31.243
Jimmy, bro, what you doing?

35:35.290 --> 35:39.148
Mandy? Hey, hey, it's me. It's Mummy.

35:39.248 --> 35:41.356
Hey, it's Mummy. Mandy, don't be scared.

35:41.456 --> 35:44.106
- It's Mummy. Mandy.
- Oi, oi.

35:44.206 --> 35:47.940
- Oi! Her name's Rose, not Mandy.
- No, it's my little Mandy.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.356
You want to be my little Mandy?
I don't mind.

35:51.456 --> 35:55.957
- James!
- Hey! Piss off.

36:03.581 --> 36:05.898
James, I don't like it here.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.326
Just eat your chips.

36:21.165 --> 36:25.541
How you been? I've been
going crazy, out of my mind.

36:26.498 --> 36:28.731
This is Rose. She's looking for her dad.

36:28.831 --> 36:33.707
Oh! You brought a kid, James?
Are you fuckin' serious?

36:34.623 --> 36:39.374
- I didn't plan for this.
- We need to fuck now.

36:42.248 --> 36:44.106
Hey. Hi.

36:44.206 --> 36:47.273
How about you go and
cool off in the pool

36:47.373 --> 36:49.023
whilst Uncle James and I go inside

36:49.123 --> 36:51.231
and we have a little chat?

36:51.331 --> 36:53.565
- Go on! Don't be shy. Jump in.
- Oi. Oi, Vic. Vic.

36:53.665 --> 36:55.440
- James. What?
- James?

36:55.540 --> 36:58.023
Just...

36:58.123 --> 37:00.356
- Just go for a swim, alright?
- But, James, what if...

37:00.456 --> 37:02.784
Rose, you'll be fine, OK?
It's hot. Just get in.

37:13.302 --> 37:17.106
I never would have picked
you for the fatherly type.

37:31.206 --> 37:33.955
I was so scared you
weren't gonna make it.

37:42.873 --> 37:44.940
What's wrong?

37:48.706 --> 37:51.534
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with that?

37:58.831 --> 38:00.908
Oops.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.625
What the fuck, James?

38:20.373 --> 38:23.167
Least you could do is make me come.

38:26.206 --> 38:27.953
Oi!

38:28.790 --> 38:31.834
Fuck, you can be a selfish prick.

38:38.915 --> 38:41.368
My sister's dead, Vic.

38:43.831 --> 38:45.565
She killed herself.

38:45.665 --> 38:47.356
She fuckin' killed herself.

38:47.456 --> 38:51.456
Her and Greg topped themselves,
in the shower.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.617
And the girls.

38:57.790 --> 39:01.290
And the girls, I found 'em.
They're gone.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.163
They're fucking gone.

39:06.998 --> 39:09.417
What's the matter with you?

39:13.081 --> 39:15.329
Did you hear what I said?

39:16.206 --> 39:17.898
Why'd you just tell me that?

39:17.998 --> 39:19.606
I mean, what's the
point of knowing that?

39:26.123 --> 39:27.856
You're here now.

39:27.956 --> 39:29.773
Can't we just have a good fuckin' time?

39:29.873 --> 39:32.315
Selfish fuckin' prick.

39:32.415 --> 39:34.959
What the hell's the matter with you?

39:39.331 --> 39:42.565
Come on. Freddy says we
have five, six hours max.

39:42.665 --> 39:45.789
Let's just make the most of it, OK?

39:48.831 --> 39:50.783
Have some.

39:57.123 --> 40:00.406
I'll tell you what?
Baby. Look. Listen.

40:02.456 --> 40:05.125
How about I give you a sneak peek?

40:38.998 --> 40:40.666
You're so beautiful.

40:43.081 --> 40:45.625
Oh, hey, look. Hey.

40:53.623 --> 40:56.793
You remind me so much
of my little Mandy.

41:02.581 --> 41:04.398
I know how sad you're feeling right now,

41:04.498 --> 41:08.106
but I... I have just the thing for it.

41:24.248 --> 41:25.665
It's easy.

41:32.048 --> 41:36.707
See? Now it's your turn. You do.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.368
Now it's your turn.

41:44.623 --> 41:47.622
Will you take me to my
aunt's place if I do?

41:53.040 --> 41:56.164
First things first.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.787
So pretty.

42:10.081 --> 42:12.204
Give me the torch.

42:17.605 --> 42:19.523
Pretty fuckin' cool?

42:19.623 --> 42:22.981
Freddy made it all happen,
just like he said.

42:27.790 --> 42:32.315
I want to cover every bit
of cement with colour.

42:32.415 --> 42:35.664
It'll make a real difference,
don't ya reckon?

42:42.790 --> 42:46.199
Freddy reckons there's enough
supplies to last a year.

42:47.456 --> 42:52.190
So, what do you think of our new home?

42:52.290 --> 42:54.440
We're all dead, Vic.

42:54.540 --> 42:56.815
We're all dead.

42:56.915 --> 43:00.606
You, me, Freddy. Everyone.

43:00.706 --> 43:02.523
It's the fucking end.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.731
You need to be a fuckload
deeper than this.

43:05.831 --> 43:07.981
A fuckload deeper.

43:08.081 --> 43:11.065
Thousands of kilometres deeper,
just for a fucking start.

43:11.165 --> 43:13.106
And then what do you think?

43:13.206 --> 43:15.065
Things are just gonna fucking clear up

43:15.165 --> 43:18.065
and that we can just go back out,
get on with fucking life...

43:18.165 --> 43:22.450
whoop-de-fucking-do...
after a fucking year?

43:23.540 --> 43:26.190
Look around, Vic.

43:26.290 --> 43:28.648
I mean, just fucking look around.

43:28.748 --> 43:32.398
This is a fucking coffin, not a home.

43:32.498 --> 43:35.440
Why are you being so mean?

44:21.873 --> 44:24.773
Freddy said we could
survive it down here.

44:24.873 --> 44:27.356
Freddy's offering us hope down here.

44:27.456 --> 44:31.160
Don't you want to be with me, down here?

44:39.331 --> 44:42.231
You went and saw her.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.023
You never even went and
saw your family, did ya?

44:48.123 --> 44:49.690
Stop.

44:49.790 --> 44:54.190
This whole time, you were fuckin'
her brains out by the beach.

44:54.290 --> 44:56.731
You could have stayed there.

44:56.831 --> 44:59.625
Bet you're fuckin' kicking yourself now.

45:00.581 --> 45:02.523
Hey.

45:02.623 --> 45:06.106
You think you're better
than all of this?

45:06.206 --> 45:09.398
Better than me, hey? You're not.

45:09.498 --> 45:12.898
You're worthless.
And you're a bad fuckin' liar.

45:12.998 --> 45:16.773
Fucking hate you! I fucking...

45:16.873 --> 45:19.315
Fuck you, ya fuckin' prick!

45:19.415 --> 45:22.243
Fuck you!

45:26.331 --> 45:28.875
I don't want to die!

45:29.998 --> 45:33.523
James! James, I'm so scared!

45:33.623 --> 45:37.356
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

45:37.456 --> 45:41.315
- Stop, Vic. Stop.
- I'm so scared, James.

45:41.415 --> 45:44.334
I'm sorry. I'm so scared.

45:48.123 --> 45:49.898
I'm sorry.

45:49.998 --> 45:52.496
I'm sorry.

45:55.623 --> 45:57.951
- I'm sorry.
- Kiss me, James.

46:02.165 --> 46:03.940
- Stop, Vic. Stop.
- Kiss me.

46:04.040 --> 46:08.023
- Vic, stop! Please.
- Please, kiss me.

46:08.123 --> 46:10.315
- Please stop, Vic, Vic.
- Kiss me!

46:10.415 --> 46:12.565
Stop. Stop.

46:12.665 --> 46:15.231
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop, stop. Stop.

46:15.331 --> 46:17.231
- Kiss me.
- Please stop. Stop.

46:17.331 --> 46:18.815
- Please. Kiss me.
- Please stop.

46:18.915 --> 46:21.648
I'm scared. I'm scared too.

46:21.748 --> 46:24.273
I'm scared. Yeah.

46:24.373 --> 46:26.356
Yeah.

46:26.456 --> 46:28.565
Stop.

46:28.665 --> 46:30.565
Just listen to me.

46:30.665 --> 46:32.940
I came here because I
didn't know what to think.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.231
I didn't know what to do.

46:35.331 --> 46:39.911
Just wanted to block it
out and get fucked up.

46:41.873 --> 46:43.523
I can't.

46:43.623 --> 46:45.791
I can't block it out.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.787
What are you gonna do?

46:53.831 --> 46:56.148
I'm gonna take that
girl back to her dad.

46:56.248 --> 46:59.418
- No.
- It's where she belongs.

47:00.623 --> 47:03.952
What about you, though?
Where do you belong?

47:05.915 --> 47:07.356
Not here.

47:11.665 --> 47:13.492
I'm sorry.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.413
Vic, I'm sorry.

47:19.831 --> 47:21.999
Vic.

47:22.998 --> 47:25.856
If you leave, I'll kill you.

47:25.956 --> 47:29.660
- Vic.
- And then I'll kill myself.

47:36.040 --> 47:39.949
Oh! Jesus Christ, Vic!
What are you doing?

47:46.248 --> 47:48.731
You knew I wanted to show
Jimmy this place myself.

47:48.831 --> 47:51.250
And you had to fuckin' do it, didn't ya?

47:57.956 --> 47:59.703
Why are you crying?

48:01.040 --> 48:03.993
Why is she crying, Jim?

48:04.831 --> 48:06.148
What's going on? What did I miss?

48:06.248 --> 48:08.773
Why is she crying?

48:08.873 --> 48:11.606
Jim? Talk to me, dickhead.

48:11.706 --> 48:13.773
Why the fuck is she crying?

48:13.873 --> 48:16.731
Stop fucking telling her these
crazy stories of survival!

48:16.831 --> 48:19.773
It's not right!
She's your fuckin' sister!

48:19.873 --> 48:21.398
Stop telling her
everything's gonna be OK!

48:21.498 --> 48:23.606
- It is gonna be OK!
- It's not!

48:23.706 --> 48:26.398
- You shut the fuck up.
- You don't belong down here.

48:26.498 --> 48:31.106
- What are you talking about?
- You don't belong down here.

48:31.206 --> 48:33.440
Oi!

48:33.540 --> 48:37.231
- What's he been saying, darling?
- We're not deep enough.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.454
We're all gonna die.

48:41.040 --> 48:45.541
You fuckin' killjoy!
You fuckin' get back here, Jim!

49:14.831 --> 49:17.830
Rose! Rose!

49:20.206 --> 49:24.481
- Hey, Jimmy, man.
- Rose! Rose! Rose!

49:24.581 --> 49:27.148
- What'd you do to her?
- Never mind. She's mine.

49:27.248 --> 49:29.481
- Mandy!
- Her name's not Mandy!

49:29.581 --> 49:31.690
It's Rose! What's wrong?

49:31.790 --> 49:33.731
She's burning up.
What'd you give to her?

49:33.831 --> 49:36.023
- Nothing!
- What'd you fuckin' give to her?

49:36.123 --> 49:38.872
- What did you give to her?
- I didn't give her anything!

49:39.873 --> 49:41.315
- Sorry, Rose.
- Mandy!

49:41.415 --> 49:43.523
Her name's Rose! It's not Mandy!

49:43.623 --> 49:45.773
He's got my daughter!

49:45.873 --> 49:48.417
- He's got my daughter!
- Fuck off!

49:51.123 --> 49:53.898
Not cool, man. Alright?

49:53.998 --> 49:55.481
Not cool.

49:55.581 --> 49:58.190
Not cool! Not cool, Jimmy!

49:58.290 --> 50:00.815
Just trying to have a good
time and you spoil it, man.

50:00.915 --> 50:04.148
OK? You can't push women like that.

50:04.248 --> 50:07.648
Alright? You fuckin' killjoy.

50:07.748 --> 50:09.981
You fuckin' ungrateful fuck!

50:10.081 --> 50:12.190
She's not good. She's not good.
Just let us leave.

50:12.290 --> 50:14.023
- No! He's got my Mandy!
- Oi! Fuck off!

50:14.123 --> 50:15.898
- I want my Mandy!
- Put her fucking down!

50:15.998 --> 50:17.690
Her name's Rose!

50:17.790 --> 50:19.440
- Put her fucking down!
- She's fuckin' crazy.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.398
Look at her. She's off her fuckin' dial!

50:21.498 --> 50:23.315
- I'm not putting her down.
- Yes, you fuckin' are.

50:23.415 --> 50:25.606
- Just shoot him!
- I'm not putting her down!

50:25.706 --> 50:27.981
Just shoot him! Just shoot him!

50:28.081 --> 50:29.940
- Fuck, man.
- I'm not putting her down.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.690
I've got a bullet for your head
if you don't put her down.

50:32.790 --> 50:35.065
- Give me the gun, Freddy.
- Vicky, what are you doing?

50:35.165 --> 50:37.315
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

50:37.415 --> 50:39.333
- Just shoot him!
- Don't do that.

50:40.540 --> 50:43.106
Shoot him! Just fuckin' shoot him!

50:43.206 --> 50:44.828
Vicky, please.

50:46.290 --> 50:48.981
- Just fucking shoot him!
- Vic!

50:49.081 --> 50:50.984
Just fucking shoot him!

50:53.581 --> 50:55.749
Fuck, yeah, bitches!

51:03.581 --> 51:05.374
Go.

51:17.998 --> 51:21.190
No! No, no, no! No! No!

51:21.290 --> 51:23.606
- No!
- Dad...

51:23.706 --> 51:26.409
- Fuck!
- My skin's hot.

51:52.248 --> 51:55.201
Come on. Drink. Drink.

52:11.290 --> 52:13.773
<i>...Tiger land</i>

52:13.873 --> 52:17.023
<i>In any weather,
we will see us with a grin...</i>

52:17.123 --> 52:20.398
Hold tight, Rose. Hold tight.

52:20.498 --> 52:22.690
<i>When we're behind, we don't mind</i>

52:22.790 --> 52:26.856
<i>We are gonna win
We're from Tiger land</i>

52:26.956 --> 52:30.773
<i>The fighting fury, Tiger land</i>

52:30.873 --> 52:33.981
<i>And if you see us...</i>

52:34.081 --> 52:36.231
Oi, oi! Fuckin'...

52:36.331 --> 52:38.856
Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate!

52:38.956 --> 52:40.783
Fuck's sake! Get back here!

52:43.540 --> 52:46.243
Hold on. Hold on, Rose.

53:02.623 --> 53:04.565
Mum!

53:04.665 --> 53:06.773
It's Jimmy, Mum!

53:06.873 --> 53:08.871
It's OK, Rose.

53:09.706 --> 53:12.690
Mum, it's Jimmy! Mum!

53:12.790 --> 53:14.815
I've got a little girl! She needs help!

53:14.915 --> 53:18.606
Mum, she's burning up!
Please! Mum, come on!

53:18.706 --> 53:22.115
Don't kick the fuckin' door!

53:28.873 --> 53:31.872
OK, Rose. OK.

53:37.498 --> 53:39.371
Here.

53:42.331 --> 53:44.158
Thanks.

53:45.831 --> 53:47.273
You little prick.

53:47.373 --> 53:49.481
There's no way you were coming back.

53:49.581 --> 53:51.273
And now here you are, just like that.

53:51.373 --> 53:53.398
- I was.
- Oh, yeah.

53:53.498 --> 53:55.773
I was, alright?

53:55.873 --> 53:57.523
I wondered what I'd say to you

53:57.623 --> 54:00.042
if you did somehow magically appear.

54:01.790 --> 54:06.416
It's funny, you know, I...
I don't feel sad, happy.

54:08.248 --> 54:10.231
Just numb inside.

54:10.331 --> 54:14.148
I was gonna swing by, Mum.
What do you want me to say?

54:14.248 --> 54:17.148
Do you think I planned for this?

54:39.081 --> 54:42.615
- Can I bum a demon?
- Knock yourself out.

54:46.331 --> 54:49.660
You seen your sister, by any chance?

54:59.290 --> 55:00.731
No.

55:00.831 --> 55:03.580
Well, I went round there yesterday.

55:05.540 --> 55:07.815
Had some chocolates for the girls.

55:07.915 --> 55:10.690
I knocked, waited, no answer.

55:10.790 --> 55:13.539
Called out, like an idiot.

55:15.498 --> 55:17.496
No-one came to the door.

55:18.581 --> 55:20.398
Not even the girls.

55:20.498 --> 55:22.315
Oh, so selfish.

55:22.415 --> 55:25.356
I don't have rights to
see my own grandkids.

55:25.456 --> 55:28.523
It's that husband of hers.
He's driven a wedge.

55:28.623 --> 55:31.940
- Didn't you go inside?
- You even listening?

55:32.040 --> 55:35.940
No-one came to the door.
I could tell that they were at home.

55:36.040 --> 55:39.481
Well, I did go around today.

55:39.581 --> 55:43.206
- Thought you said you didn't.
- Well, I did.

55:45.456 --> 55:47.579
I wanted to use the car.

55:49.373 --> 55:51.826
So I went inside.

55:59.248 --> 56:03.106
There was a note on the coffee
table saying they'd gone.

56:03.206 --> 56:04.981
Packed up and left.

56:05.081 --> 56:08.330
Gone? Gone where?

56:13.956 --> 56:17.148
Didn't say, alright?
Just said they'd gone.

56:17.248 --> 56:20.065
Explains why no-one went
to the fuckin' front door.

56:20.165 --> 56:23.335
I mean, at least they're
all together, right?

56:24.790 --> 56:26.773
Oh... who'd want to live in a world

56:26.873 --> 56:29.273
where you can't even say
goodbye to your grandkids?

56:29.373 --> 56:33.953
Sometimes, I swear,
the end can't come soon enough.

56:38.665 --> 56:41.618
How much petrol you
got in the Laser, Mum?

56:42.790 --> 56:45.690
- You are unbelievable.
- How much?

56:45.790 --> 56:48.106
Who you trying to impress?

56:48.206 --> 56:50.356
Running around,
trying to help this girl.

56:50.456 --> 56:53.148
I'm just trying to help her, Mum.

56:53.248 --> 56:55.701
If you can't understand that,
then that's your problem.

56:57.248 --> 56:59.690
Well, maybe I can't understand.
I'm just your stupid mother.

56:59.790 --> 57:04.040
What would I know?
What would I know about you?

57:06.831 --> 57:09.106
- It's gone. Someone pinched it.
- When?

57:09.206 --> 57:10.761
Does it matter?

57:16.665 --> 57:18.788
You stubborn old bat.

57:34.706 --> 57:36.499
Try the shed.

57:37.415 --> 57:41.074
There's a couple of jerry
cans floating round in there.

57:52.623 --> 57:54.370
Fuck.

58:02.748 --> 58:04.356
Mick down the street,

58:04.456 --> 58:06.565
he never came back for 'em
once his shed was done.

58:06.665 --> 58:08.106
He won't be comin' back for 'em.

58:08.206 --> 58:11.356
He went bush,
like a lot of those nut jobs.

58:11.456 --> 58:14.250
Like that's gonna make
a bloody difference.

58:15.873 --> 58:18.576
How about you, Mum?
What are you gonna do?

58:20.081 --> 58:22.648
When it happens.
You got anything planned?

58:22.748 --> 58:25.121
Got a few puzzles I'll
try and get finished.

58:26.790 --> 58:28.037
Puzzles?

58:45.623 --> 58:48.417
Yeah. Good girl. Yeah.

58:50.290 --> 58:53.565
There you go. Good? Yeah?

58:53.665 --> 58:55.663
OK?

58:58.790 --> 59:01.038
We're gonna see Dad.

59:20.123 --> 59:23.148
You know what pisses
me off the most, James?

59:23.248 --> 59:25.273
I already did this.

59:25.373 --> 59:27.606
I already said goodbye
to you a number of times.

59:27.706 --> 59:31.661
More than once.
And you had to turn up for real.

59:32.831 --> 59:34.829
Sorry, Mum.

59:36.706 --> 59:38.453
Don't be.

59:41.873 --> 59:44.201
It's a good thing what
you're doing for her.

59:54.206 --> 59:56.329
You better go.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.041
Go on.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:07.708
Good luck with the puzzle, Mum.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:29.917
South-East Asia's gone.

01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:32.648
All of it's gone.

01:00:32.748 --> 01:00:36.523
My brother Steve's in Thailand.

01:00:37.223 --> 01:00:39.100
Steve-O.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.981
I'm glad we got to have that chat
before the phones went down.

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:47.455
Hope you were somewhere beautiful, bro.

01:00:50.206 --> 01:00:52.329
Over.

01:00:58.623 --> 01:01:01.167
Sorry, James.

01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:04.078
What for?

01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:07.440
That woman said she'd take
me to Aunty Janice's.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.773
I shouldn't have listened to her.

01:01:10.873 --> 01:01:12.356
I keep getting you into trouble.

01:01:12.456 --> 01:01:15.065
No, no, no. Don't be silly.

01:01:15.165 --> 01:01:17.788
Alright? It's over now.

01:01:18.956 --> 01:01:20.703
Don't be upset, alright?

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:24.493
You don't want your dad
to see you upset, do you?

01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:27.356
- No.
- No.

01:01:27.456 --> 01:01:28.898
You're a tough chick.

01:01:28.998 --> 01:01:31.940
- Say it.
- I'm a tough chick.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.273
- I didn't hear you.
- I'm a tough chick.

01:01:34.373 --> 01:01:37.417
- I don't believe you.
- I'm a tough chick!

01:01:48.456 --> 01:01:50.875
What happened to your girlfriend?

01:01:53.456 --> 01:01:55.454
Things didn't work out.

01:01:57.956 --> 01:01:59.856
You broke up?

01:01:59.956 --> 01:02:02.500
Yeah.

01:02:03.581 --> 01:02:08.231
She was pretty but not... that pretty.

01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:13.731
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:16.106
She was weird.

01:02:16.206 --> 01:02:19.831
Thought you'd have had a
much nicer girlfriend than that.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.398
Come on, James. Everyone's here!
Dad! Dad, I'm here!

01:02:49.498 --> 01:02:52.815
Dad, it's me! Dad!

01:02:52.915 --> 01:02:57.666
I'm here! Come on, guys,
it's me! Aunty Janice!

01:03:00.415 --> 01:03:03.698
It's me! I'm here! Dad!

01:03:06.831 --> 01:03:08.783
Where are you, Dad?

01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:12.203
Dad!

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.620
Dad!

01:03:17.456 --> 01:03:19.203
Dad, it's me!

01:03:20.623 --> 01:03:22.791
Dad!

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.867
Dad?

01:03:29.456 --> 01:03:30.604
Dad!

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.663
Dad?

01:03:48.873 --> 01:03:52.452
- Hello?
- Dad!

01:04:01.206 --> 01:04:03.408
Maybe they're over at the pond.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.495
Dad! Hello!

01:04:30.248 --> 01:04:33.231
Hello? Dad?

01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:35.981
- Aunty Janice!
- Hello!

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:38.375
Dad!

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.913
James?

01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:02.106
- Rose!
- James.

01:06:02.206 --> 01:06:04.190
- They're not here.
- You OK?

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:05.731
- They're not anywhere.
- Stop.

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:08.204
Did you find anyone?

01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:16.856
- Rose, you can't go over there.
- Let me get past!

01:06:16.956 --> 01:06:18.523
Rose, please.

01:06:18.623 --> 01:06:20.148
Please. Come on.

01:06:20.248 --> 01:06:22.041
Why not?

01:06:22.873 --> 01:06:24.700
Why not?

01:06:29.206 --> 01:06:31.079
You can't go down
there 'cause they're...

01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:39.023
dead.

01:06:39.123 --> 01:06:42.106
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey! Hey!

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:43.981
Rose! Rose! You can't!

01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:45.815
You don't know what he looks like!

01:06:45.915 --> 01:06:48.148
- Please, I need to see him.
- He's there, Rose. Stop!

01:06:49.624 --> 01:06:51.606
Put me down!

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:53.748
Put me down, please!

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.398
- Put me down!
- Hey, sit.

01:06:57.498 --> 01:07:00.398
- Sit down.
- Please!

01:07:00.498 --> 01:07:03.781
I'm sorry. Rose. Rose!

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.356
I need to see him.

01:07:08.456 --> 01:07:11.205
I need to make sure.

01:07:16.623 --> 01:07:18.370
OK.

01:08:51.165 --> 01:08:53.993
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:08:55.372 --> 01:08:57.826
I love you.

01:09:05.247 --> 01:09:08.273
- Rose? Rose.
- No!

01:09:08.372 --> 01:09:11.648
- Now, come on.
- No. I don't want to go.

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.981
- Rose, he's dead.
- I'm not leaving him.

01:09:14.081 --> 01:09:15.814
- Come on.
- No!

01:09:15.915 --> 01:09:17.564
Come on, Rose. Come on. Let's go.

01:09:17.665 --> 01:09:19.314
- No, don't.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.689
What?

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:27.459
Dad wanted us to be
together when it happened.

01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:32.625
This is where I need to be, James.

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:35.912
With Dad.

01:09:37.331 --> 01:09:39.499
I'm sorry.

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:30.659
I wish you could have met my dad.

01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:50.413
It was in your dad's pocket.

01:10:56.706 --> 01:11:00.331
I remember this day.

01:11:01.581 --> 01:11:03.481
It was her birthday.

01:11:03.581 --> 01:11:06.250
Dad got the waiters to sing
'Happy Birthday' to her.

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:09.273
She looked really embarrassed,

01:11:09.373 --> 01:11:11.792
but I think she secretly liked it.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.493
You know, I'd have been a dad, Rose.

01:11:25.623 --> 01:11:28.190
Was that woman at the party pregnant?

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:30.231
Not her.

01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:33.330
Someone else.

01:11:37.706 --> 01:11:39.704
Is she prettier than the other one?

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:43.731
Yeah.

01:11:43.831 --> 01:11:46.534
Then how come you're not with her?

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:53.163
'Cause I messed things up.

01:11:54.873 --> 01:11:57.898
I've messed a lot of things up, Rose.

01:11:57.998 --> 01:12:00.576
What did you do?

01:12:02.873 --> 01:12:04.996
I left her all alone.

01:12:11.248 --> 01:12:13.576
There's still time.

01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:36.954
OK.

01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:52.875
Sorry I bit you.

01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:57.291
It's OK.

01:12:58.415 --> 01:13:00.413
See ya.

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:04.663
See ya.

01:13:11.665 --> 01:13:13.583
James.

01:13:14.748 --> 01:13:18.373
I'm gonna watch you until
I can't see you anymore.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:23.415
Can you watch me too?
Until you can't see me?

01:13:24.623 --> 01:13:26.746
Sure.

01:15:15.165 --> 01:15:17.398
Ladies and gents,

01:15:17.498 --> 01:15:21.157
I'm sure you can all hear
that rumble in the air.

01:15:26.581 --> 01:15:28.328
We've got just under an hour.

01:15:32.123 --> 01:15:34.065
I just...

01:15:34.165 --> 01:15:36.208
just don't know what to say.

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:40.538
I'm trying to think of something poetic.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.371
It's coming.

01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:49.500
It's coming.

01:16:09.456 --> 01:16:14.207
No! No! No, no, no, no! No!

01:16:17.581 --> 01:16:21.023
No! No!

01:16:21.123 --> 01:16:22.540
No!

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:29.481
Maybe it's nothing more than hope.

01:16:29.581 --> 01:16:33.581
Or maybe we'll see each other again.

01:16:35.498 --> 01:16:38.417
Well, wouldn't that be something?

01:16:40.748 --> 01:16:43.148
Wouldn't that be something?

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:35.537
Zoe!

01:17:36.373 --> 01:17:39.314
Zoe! Zoe!

01:17:40.765 --> 01:17:42.912
Zoe.

01:18:41.748 --> 01:18:43.648
Zoe!

01:18:43.748 --> 01:18:46.065
I'm here.

01:18:46.165 --> 01:18:47.606
- Don't you touch me.
- I'm here.

01:18:47.706 --> 01:18:49.829
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Zoe!

01:18:50.915 --> 01:18:55.148
- I'm sorry. Zoe!
- You left me alone!

01:18:55.248 --> 01:18:57.481
I'm sorry. Zoe. I'm sorry.

01:18:57.581 --> 01:19:00.864
- You left me!
- I'm sorry!

01:19:04.748 --> 01:19:07.371
I'm sorry. I'm here!

01:19:08.498 --> 01:19:10.606
I love you so much.

01:19:10.706 --> 01:19:13.523
I'm sorry.

01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:16.417
I'm here.

01:19:17.915 --> 01:19:20.538
I love you so much.

01:19:24.623 --> 01:19:26.746
I love you.

01:19:28.498 --> 01:19:30.981
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.742
It's beautiful.
