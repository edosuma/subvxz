WEBVTT

02:01.387 --> 02:02.798
Wake him up.

02:03.514 --> 02:07.346
- I don't know. Maybe he needs the rest.
- He's not resting. Look at him.

02:07.602 --> 02:10.353
His eyeballs are disco dancing
under those lids.

02:10.729 --> 02:14.265
- Disco dancing, is that back?
- It's Gibbs. It never left.

02:14.358 --> 02:16.150
McGee should have...

02:16.819 --> 02:18.100
hours ago.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.193
Norfolk office opens in...

02:22.700 --> 02:24.075
24 minutes.

02:24.702 --> 02:26.410
It's a 193-mile drive.

02:26.496 --> 02:28.369
Well, I was gonna call in.

02:28.623 --> 02:29.868
Yeah?

02:31.167 --> 02:32.994
And tell them what, McGee?

02:33.085 --> 02:36.371
Well, that you needed me
to work here today.

02:36.464 --> 02:38.373
Why do I need you here?

02:38.799 --> 02:42.465
Well, because I have an idea
on how to speed up the search for him.

02:43.888 --> 02:45.548
I'm listening.

02:46.098 --> 02:48.803
Oh, Gibbs. I dig them.

02:50.186 --> 02:51.645
Tell DiNozzo.

02:52.396 --> 02:54.638
The database you're scanning
has over 10 million photos.

02:54.732 --> 02:56.310
It'll take a month to check them all.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.476
Is your idea to depress me, McGee?

02:58.569 --> 03:01.321
No, no, no, no, no.
If we found out his precise age,

03:01.405 --> 03:03.694
then we could limit the search
to the year he turned 21.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.488
73% of UK graduates are 21.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.458
And scanning that year
would cut down the search

03:08.538 --> 03:09.617
to a couple of days.

03:09.705 --> 03:10.737
It's a good idea, huh?

03:10.831 --> 03:12.954
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's a hell of a good idea.

03:13.042 --> 03:14.121
Just one problem.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.354
How are we gonna find his age,

03:15.378 --> 03:17.121
when we don't know who the hell he is!

03:17.213 --> 03:18.899
Would you be less grumpy
if you slept in a bed?

03:18.923 --> 03:20.002
No, I would not!

03:20.091 --> 03:21.170
I didn't think so.

03:21.259 --> 03:22.836
The FBI has a software programme

03:22.927 --> 03:25.364
they use on photos of children
that have been missing for years

03:25.388 --> 03:26.698
to show what they'd look like today.

03:26.722 --> 03:29.676
I know what that ass
looks like today, McGee.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.047
I know you do, boss.

03:31.143 --> 03:34.429
But, to create that programme,
the FBI needed age-specific criteria.

03:34.522 --> 03:38.057
So, McGee spent half the night using
their criteria to develop a programme

03:38.150 --> 03:40.024
that can tell a person's age
from a photo.

03:40.111 --> 03:42.862
I used the FBI algorithms
for cardioidal strain,

03:42.947 --> 03:46.731
pore size, wrinkles, adipose tissue
and length of the nose and ears.

03:46.826 --> 03:48.470
Which keep getting longer
the older you get,

03:48.494 --> 03:51.945
whether or not you wear earrings,
so you might as well wear them.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.077
This you can do?

03:55.167 --> 03:57.623
I just need a couple hours
to put it on your hard drive.

03:57.712 --> 04:00.748
All right. That's worth a hall pass.
I'll call Norfolk.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.833
- He stay at your place?
- Yep.

04:03.217 --> 04:05.044
You sleep in the coffin, McGee?

04:08.598 --> 04:09.796
Coffin?

04:10.975 --> 04:14.011
You said that it was a boxed sofa-bed.

04:14.103 --> 04:17.223
Well, it is. Sort of.

04:17.315 --> 04:19.224
That's why
you wouldn't turn the lights on.

04:19.317 --> 04:21.605
Oh. I can't believe I slept in a coffin.

04:22.987 --> 04:24.398
Not just slept.

04:32.997 --> 04:34.372
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:44.175 --> 04:47.259
Okay. You're on, baby! You're on!

05:00.483 --> 05:02.974
The steps. I'll get her on the steps.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.192
Women can't run steps.

05:27.218 --> 05:30.172
One of those is Marine One.
It flies the President.

05:34.684 --> 05:35.798
German?

05:36.185 --> 05:37.300
Swedish.

05:38.229 --> 05:39.427
Even better.

05:40.356 --> 05:41.636
You speak any English?

05:45.319 --> 05:47.395
Yeah. That's funny.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.354
Okay. I gotta get in shape.

05:54.203 --> 05:56.575
Mr. Prime Minister,
welcome to the White House.

06:00.918 --> 06:03.326
What do you think
about what Sharon is doing?

06:03.421 --> 06:06.872
Assassinating Hamas leaders
or pulling settlements out of Gaza?

06:07.550 --> 06:10.385
Either. I'm just trying
to start a conversation.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.676
- I'm John. Ag Department.
- Kate. NCIS.

06:14.765 --> 06:15.928
Hi. Really?

06:16.308 --> 06:17.423
Yes. Why?

06:17.518 --> 06:19.807
I've never seen you.
I'm in NCIS twice a month.

06:19.895 --> 06:22.766
- You are?
- Yeah, I specialise in actuarial analysis.

06:22.857 --> 06:24.102
Hail and storm damage.

06:24.859 --> 06:26.567
What NCIS do you think I'm with?

06:26.986 --> 06:28.646
National Crop Insurance Service?

06:28.738 --> 06:29.852
That's us.

06:30.239 --> 06:33.359
Oh, yeah, she's a whiz on how
corn losses affect pork belly futures.

06:33.451 --> 06:34.530
Excuse me.

06:36.036 --> 06:37.365
- My boss.
- Oh.

06:37.872 --> 06:40.789
- A weird sense of humour.
- Yeah, I...

06:43.544 --> 06:46.035
"How corn losses
affect pork belly futures"?

06:46.130 --> 06:50.044
Rule number seven:
Always be specific when you lie.

06:53.637 --> 06:54.882
Why are you bringing me coffee

06:54.972 --> 06:56.680
from your caffeine dealer
two blocks away?

06:56.766 --> 06:58.473
And don't use rule seven.

06:58.559 --> 07:00.053
You want that or not?

07:00.853 --> 07:02.727
I take my coffee
with milk and sweetener.

07:02.813 --> 07:03.892
Taste it.

07:12.698 --> 07:15.106
- A little strong.
- Strong's better.

07:21.081 --> 07:22.991
Gibbs, you're making me nervous.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.791
Scary scenarios
are popping into my head,

07:24.877 --> 07:27.333
like you're here to fire me

07:27.421 --> 07:30.624
or to tell me that I'm going undercover
as DiNozzo's wife.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.541
I want you to profile a terrorist.

07:34.136 --> 07:36.841
- What terrorist?
- The one you couldn't stab.

07:46.357 --> 07:47.851
Ducky tell you that?

07:51.570 --> 07:52.733
It's true.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.355
Why?

08:03.374 --> 08:04.654
His eyes.

08:06.126 --> 08:09.211
I was looking into his eyes,
and they looked kind.

08:09.296 --> 08:12.131
Did he look kind
when he blew out Gerald's shoulder?

08:12.216 --> 08:15.133
You asked me why I couldn't stab him,
and I told you.

08:15.511 --> 08:19.378
Contrary to conventional wisdom, Kate,
eyes can lie.

08:19.974 --> 08:22.299
You meet him again, don't forget that.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.135
I won't.

08:28.858 --> 08:30.103
I won't!

08:31.110 --> 08:32.485
Profile him.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.274
He's not an Islamic fanatic.

08:37.533 --> 08:42.325
Never used their rhetoric.
No mention of jihad, Allah, infidels.

08:42.413 --> 08:44.405
Whatever drives him, it isn't martyrdom.

08:44.498 --> 08:46.158
- Revenge?
- Could be.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.240
Maybe money.

08:49.169 --> 08:50.712
A Hamas terrorist...

08:51.005 --> 08:52.084
in it for the money?

08:52.172 --> 08:55.921
Well, he's not in it for the 70 virgins.
He'd have no trouble attracting women.

08:57.511 --> 08:58.756
Don't go there.

09:00.931 --> 09:04.016
- Why money?
- I just get the feeling that he lives large.

09:04.101 --> 09:07.019
He was well groomed.
Manicured nails, perfect teeth.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.687
Salon-styled hair.

09:12.526 --> 09:14.685
Gibbs, what is it with your hair?

09:15.029 --> 09:16.737
What's wrong with my hair?

09:17.239 --> 09:19.611
Nothing, nothing. Your hair is...

09:20.618 --> 09:22.943
- you.
- Yeah. Thank you.

09:23.495 --> 09:24.575
What else?

09:25.122 --> 09:28.456
He's intelligent, bold,
willing to take big risks.

09:32.129 --> 09:33.872
- Why?
- Why not?

09:41.597 --> 09:43.340
Why did he give me a chance
to kill him?

09:43.432 --> 09:46.267
He had a flak vest.
Knew you'd double-tap him in the chest.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.261
What if I shot him in the head?

09:48.354 --> 09:50.761
It's a risk he had to take
to make his escape plan work.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.481
No, he did not.

09:54.234 --> 09:56.523
He could have killed me in cold blood.

09:59.323 --> 10:00.947
HRT comes in.

10:01.492 --> 10:03.116
He throws a flash bang.

10:04.828 --> 10:07.664
Either way, he escapes. It's the same.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.531
You're right.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.999
Why'd he give you a shot at him?

10:13.295 --> 10:16.000
He needs to face death to feel alive.

10:18.175 --> 10:19.835
Maybe to feel anything.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.882
Nice bike, Mr. Craig.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.809
It's a motorcycle.

11:11.895 --> 11:13.935
A bike is something one pedals.

11:15.941 --> 11:18.776
- Smoky Sam.
- Quad launcher. Four missiles.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.650
- Maximum altitude?
- 1,400 feet.

11:24.324 --> 11:26.032
We dogfight well above that.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.787
Unless you're flying ultralights,
Smoky Sam can't hurt you.

11:28.871 --> 11:31.243
It's just phenolic paper and Styrofoam.

11:32.708 --> 11:35.828
Wannabe aces must pay good money
to pretend to dogfight.

11:36.628 --> 11:38.087
They don't pretend.

11:39.214 --> 11:41.836
We fly aerobatic aircraft
armed with laser guns,

11:41.925 --> 11:44.962
smoke emitters,
combat sounds in their headsets...

11:45.054 --> 11:46.631
It's very real.

11:46.889 --> 11:49.214
Except we don't permit dying.

11:49.516 --> 11:51.473
How about pissing their pants?

11:51.894 --> 11:54.432
Smoky Sam looks awful real
coming up at you.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.688
Navy uses them at Top Gun.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.349
- It's all set, Marv.
- Thanks, Matt.

12:01.737 --> 12:04.228
- Wanna launch it?
- Why not?

12:21.623 --> 12:22.999
Good morning, Kate!

12:23.083 --> 12:25.206
That grin can only mean one thing.

12:25.669 --> 12:28.421
- And what is that?
- You're in love. Again.

12:30.632 --> 12:31.830
You are so right.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.084
- What's this one's name?
- She's Swedish.

12:34.177 --> 12:35.458
You don't know her name.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.092
How can you be in love with someone
and not...

12:38.181 --> 12:40.221
I forgot, it's you we're talking about.

12:40.309 --> 12:41.886
You have mail.

12:41.977 --> 12:46.271
- Let me see who misses me, today.
- Tiffany. Crystal. Fanny.

12:46.606 --> 12:48.231
The girls down on the farm.

12:49.109 --> 12:51.232
- You hacked into my computer?
- No.

12:51.695 --> 12:54.612
Ever since you used mine,
all I get is porn spam.

12:55.782 --> 12:58.617
- Like you never opened an X-rated site.
- Never.

12:59.077 --> 13:00.619
You know, that's sad.

13:00.787 --> 13:03.113
- Why?
- 'Cause I believe you.

13:03.874 --> 13:04.988
Where's the boss?

13:05.208 --> 13:07.450
MTAC. Talking to Bahrain.

13:12.007 --> 13:14.712
Tony... I'm worried about him.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.501
Gibbs? That's like worrying
about Jim Bowie in a knife fight.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.470
Bowie was killed at the Alamo.

13:19.556 --> 13:20.719
I know, I saw the movie.

13:20.807 --> 13:23.559
Tony, he's fixated on that terrorist.

13:23.643 --> 13:25.054
Not fixated. Determined.

13:25.145 --> 13:26.888
Like Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive,

13:26.980 --> 13:29.554
like the Duke in The Searchers,
Mel Gibson in Payback.

13:29.649 --> 13:31.357
- You ever read a book?
- Kate,

13:31.443 --> 13:32.985
"determined" is good in a cop.

13:33.070 --> 13:35.109
Not when it turns into obsession.

13:35.197 --> 13:37.522
Gibbs surprised me
at DC Beans this morning.

13:37.616 --> 13:38.730
He bought me coffee

13:38.825 --> 13:40.533
and then he probed me
about that terrorist

13:40.619 --> 13:42.576
like it happened yesterday,
not months ago.

13:42.662 --> 13:44.988
Wow, that is serious.
He's never bought me coffee.

13:45.499 --> 13:47.207
- Tony.
- Kate.

13:47.292 --> 13:48.703
Gibbs is like a dog.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.285
He'll gnaw at an old bone
till you throw him a steak.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.917
When he's done with the steak,
he goes back to the old bone.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.916
And the terrorist is Gibbs' old bone.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.047
Let's hope he doesn't choke on it.

14:00.555 --> 14:01.670
Damn it, Daniel!

14:01.890 --> 14:03.515
Mossad is lying to you!

14:03.600 --> 14:06.803
This bastard is too good
not to be on their radar.

14:06.895 --> 14:09.647
They swear they have nothing.
Not even a Hamas code name.

14:10.732 --> 14:14.397
Israelis tracked down
Sheik Yassin and Rantisi

14:14.486 --> 14:15.766
in the heart of Gaza.

14:15.862 --> 14:19.029
You cannot tell me
that they do not know who this guy is.

14:19.241 --> 14:21.779
Gibbs, I can only tell you
what they tell me.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.072
Any chance he's not Hamas?

14:24.162 --> 14:25.740
What if he's someone freelance,

14:25.831 --> 14:28.950
brought in
to clean up their Little Creek debacle?

14:29.251 --> 14:30.793
Hamas is like the Mafia.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.870
They'd never trust anyone
outside the family.

14:32.963 --> 14:35.086
Then Mossad has to have
a dossier on him.

14:35.173 --> 14:37.652
If they're holding out,
it could be to take him out themselves.

14:37.676 --> 14:40.131
He's not in the Middle East. He is here.

14:41.304 --> 14:42.633
Where'd you get that intel?

14:43.598 --> 14:44.796
My gut.

14:49.312 --> 14:50.475
Thank you.

14:50.564 --> 14:52.355
That was President Bush leaving...

14:52.441 --> 14:54.563
The Marines are window dressing.

14:54.651 --> 14:58.150
Only the two Secret Service agents
on Marine One are armed.

14:58.947 --> 15:03.360
Marine One, with Bush and Sharon,
will depart the White House at 7:00 p.m.

15:03.452 --> 15:07.532
It will meet two identical Marine helos
at the Washington Memorial.

15:09.249 --> 15:12.285
All three Sea Kings
will then fly to the Potomac

15:12.377 --> 15:14.168
and follow it north toward Maryland,

15:14.254 --> 15:18.168
switching positions now and then
to conceal which of them is Marine One.

15:18.467 --> 15:20.839
The flight path to Bear Island
is always the same.

15:20.927 --> 15:24.759
After that, they can fly
a number of routes to Camp David.

15:27.476 --> 15:32.303
Simi and Abdul will take the Zodiac
to Bear Island

15:32.397 --> 15:36.644
and set up Smoky Sam in these woods
on the south end.

15:37.486 --> 15:40.486
I have picked you for this vital mission,

15:40.572 --> 15:43.941
because every rock you threw as boys
at Israeli tanks

15:44.242 --> 15:45.357
has missed.

15:46.411 --> 15:49.116
And that is good. We want to miss.

15:49.331 --> 15:52.035
They can't realise
these are training missiles.

15:52.125 --> 15:55.790
They must think they've been fired at
by shoulder-launched rockets.

15:56.171 --> 15:58.923
That scenario requires all of them

15:59.007 --> 16:02.210
to execute
an immediate emergency landing.

16:03.011 --> 16:04.470
Bassam.

16:06.473 --> 16:10.056
This field is the only area within miles

16:10.143 --> 16:12.136
where they can land as a unit.

16:12.229 --> 16:13.771
When they do...

16:14.439 --> 16:16.064
we hit them.

16:16.149 --> 16:19.316
We disable Marine One's tail rotor
with a rifle grenade

16:19.402 --> 16:21.609
and destroy the other two helos
with the RPGs.

16:21.696 --> 16:24.152
And capture the butchers
Bush and Sharon

16:24.241 --> 16:27.076
to exchange
for our imprisoned brothers in Israel.

16:30.455 --> 16:33.160
How do you know which is Marine One?

16:35.210 --> 16:37.001
A bird is going to tell me.

16:40.507 --> 16:43.080
Okay. Now make him older
than mummy dust.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.510
That's so cool!

16:46.596 --> 16:49.383
Okay. Now like a young guy
on his first date.

16:53.353 --> 16:55.761
He wasn't a late bloomer
like you, McGee.

16:58.733 --> 17:00.276
He's so cute!

17:01.111 --> 17:02.190
You think so?

17:03.154 --> 17:05.396
Oh, well, not cuter than you.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.238
- Abs, I'm trying to work.
- Oh, sorry.

17:09.327 --> 17:11.284
No, I like it. It's just,
I can't concentrate.

17:11.371 --> 17:15.320
Okay. What if I watch
from way over here?

17:15.416 --> 17:16.531
Hey.

17:17.544 --> 17:18.919
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.459
Then do nothing at your desk!

17:21.548 --> 17:24.121
- Gibbs, this is my lab.
- Desk! Now!

17:24.800 --> 17:26.627
And turn off the damn noise!

17:26.928 --> 17:28.672
You got his age, McGee?

17:28.763 --> 17:30.922
- Well, I just got the...
- Yes or no?

17:31.016 --> 17:33.304
No. If you give me a minute,
I will, I think.

17:33.393 --> 17:35.966
- You think?
- No. Definitely I will.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.139
Better?

17:58.460 --> 18:00.499
Makes him 21 in 1990.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.124
You keep scanning.

18:02.213 --> 18:03.494
- You got it, boss.
- And McGee,

18:03.590 --> 18:04.965
you don't get a hit in three days,

18:05.050 --> 18:07.671
I'm gonna think
this was a ploy to play house.

18:09.846 --> 18:13.013
Gibbs was like this
just before his last divorce.

18:13.850 --> 18:17.266
- We can't divorce him, Ducky.
- You wouldn't want to, my dear,

18:17.354 --> 18:19.726
- no matter how gruff he becomes.
- Yeah.

18:19.814 --> 18:21.688
So, maybe he'll take his frustrations out

18:21.775 --> 18:23.814
on that mysterious redhead
instead of us.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.607
- Must you talk with your mouth full?
- No.

18:31.034 --> 18:33.904
So, who was Gibbs chasing
when he divorced his last wife?

18:33.995 --> 18:35.787
Had to be a redhead.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.077
You're not Gibbs!

18:39.250 --> 18:41.920
You do that again, you're going to be
wearing that tuna salad!

18:42.003 --> 18:43.912
He was after a child murderer.

18:44.005 --> 18:46.579
Victim was five. Pretty little thing.

18:46.925 --> 18:50.590
A deviant had sexually abused her
and then beaten her to death.

18:51.262 --> 18:53.385
Stuff like that makes me sick.

18:53.473 --> 18:56.308
- Did Gibbs catch him?
- Oh, yes, but it took nearly a year.

18:56.393 --> 18:58.765
By then a second girl
had been murdered.

18:58.978 --> 19:02.810
Gibbs was a bit difficult to live with
for a while after that.

19:06.111 --> 19:07.771
- It's her!
- Who?

19:08.321 --> 19:09.780
The love of my life.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.236
Oh.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.455
What... When is he gonna
grow up, Ducky?

19:22.544 --> 19:24.287
It's in the genes, my dear.

19:25.130 --> 19:28.914
In Italy, most boys Tony's age
are still living with Mama.

19:29.259 --> 19:30.539
Oh, gosh.

19:33.930 --> 19:36.884
Gotta head out,
got a Gitmo conference in 20 minutes.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.269
It was Tony's turn to buy.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.013
- I'll take care of it.
- No, no.

19:42.105 --> 19:44.477
- My treat.
- No. That's not right.

19:44.566 --> 19:47.353
Go, Kate. It's been a long, pale winter.

19:47.444 --> 19:50.777
I need some sun before returning
to my human jigsaw puzzle.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.317
You don't want to go there.

19:53.408 --> 19:54.736
You're right.

19:56.035 --> 19:58.906
- Thanks for lunch, Ducky.
- You're quite welcome.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.031
Federal agent! Follow that motorcycle!

20:52.700 --> 20:53.815
- Anything?
- Not yet.

20:53.910 --> 20:55.679
Thought I had a hit,
but there weren't enough points.

20:55.703 --> 20:57.114
Well, you trace it anyway, McGee!

20:57.205 --> 20:59.696
I did.
It's a biology teacher in Manchester.

20:59.790 --> 21:01.035
I spoke to him. Sorry.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.034
Stop apologizing.
It's a sign of weakness.

21:03.127 --> 21:04.242
Sorry. Right.

21:04.337 --> 21:06.792
- Where's Kate and Tony?
- Went to lunch with Ducky.

21:06.881 --> 21:10.546
- When?
- About an hour or so ago.

21:12.345 --> 21:16.259
- I want "or so" in minutes, McGee.
- Maybe 50.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.842
Well, they could be following a lead.

21:21.479 --> 21:24.812
Is that what you think they're doing,
Agent McGee?

21:25.983 --> 21:28.059
- No. No, I don't.
- No.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.501
This reminds me of a butcher
I met in China.

21:45.586 --> 21:47.231
He murdered someone
and chopped up the body?

21:47.255 --> 21:50.670
No, no. Claimed his big toe
could predict earthquakes.

21:52.051 --> 21:54.127
Said it tingled for hours

21:54.220 --> 21:56.675
before a quake struck
anywhere in the world.

21:56.764 --> 21:59.682
Left foot. Yes, when I assured him

21:59.767 --> 22:03.017
that many seismic events
occur daily all around the globe,

22:03.104 --> 22:05.013
he became very excited.

22:05.147 --> 22:09.015
Said that explained why
his big toe always tingled.

22:09.568 --> 22:11.894
Didn't you point out
the fallacy of his logic, Doctor?

22:11.988 --> 22:15.238
Oh, no, no, no. He was so happy.
I hadn't the heart.

22:15.324 --> 22:16.949
Are you making this up, Dr. Mallard?

22:17.034 --> 22:18.363
Good grief, no.

22:18.452 --> 22:21.572
When one spends one's career
travelling around the globe,

22:21.664 --> 22:26.492
one has an unlimited supply
of mysterious and intriguing tales.

22:26.877 --> 22:29.831
Distal phalange. Right foot, I believe.

22:31.924 --> 22:34.083
You're quite rare, Mr. Palmer.

22:34.176 --> 22:35.256
- I am?
- Yes.

22:35.344 --> 22:38.096
Most new assistants
would take one look at this lot

22:38.180 --> 22:39.295
and head for the loo.

22:40.266 --> 22:42.258
It's just a meat jigsaw puzzle.

22:43.561 --> 22:45.850
- Ducky!
- Gibbs.

22:45.938 --> 22:49.603
Look what Special Agent Balboa
found for me.

22:53.779 --> 22:55.855
Just when I think
nothing will surprise me.

22:55.948 --> 22:57.148
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

22:57.241 --> 23:00.444
One has to admire the skill
despite the depravity.

23:00.536 --> 23:01.734
Where'd Balboa find it?

23:01.829 --> 23:05.909
Oh, this poor fellow was found
in a 55-gallon drum of alcohol

23:06.000 --> 23:09.499
beside a dumpster
at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

23:09.587 --> 23:13.003
He'd been dissected by a sadist
with a knowledge of anatomy...

23:17.970 --> 23:20.426
Right ventricle, left atria.

23:20.973 --> 23:22.467
You haven't done an autopsy.

23:24.143 --> 23:27.144
Oh, Gibbs, I am so sorry.
I should have realised.

23:27.229 --> 23:28.807
It would have narrowed your search

23:28.898 --> 23:31.768
for that bastard
who put the bullet in Gerald's shoulder.

23:31.859 --> 23:34.777
- It only just came to me.
- What came to you, Ducky?

23:34.862 --> 23:38.646
That bugger knew anatomy!
I even asked him if he was a doctor.

23:38.991 --> 23:41.150
He didn't reply, but I'll wager

23:41.660 --> 23:44.448
he went to medical school in Britain!

23:45.164 --> 23:47.453
Well, that wouldn't be hard to find out.
Thanks, Duck.

23:47.541 --> 23:48.917
Hey, you're more than welcome.

23:49.001 --> 23:51.124
I'm just furious
that I didn't think of it sooner.

23:51.212 --> 23:54.378
Ducky, Kate and Tony
come back from lunch with you?

23:54.465 --> 23:57.252
No. Tony went off
on one of his usual pursuits,

23:57.343 --> 23:59.834
and Kate had to video conference
with Gitmo.

24:05.601 --> 24:07.143
Right big toe.

24:08.229 --> 24:12.641
- We have a right big toe, Doctor.
- Well, I already gave you a left big toe.

24:12.733 --> 24:14.275
I know, sir.

24:14.735 --> 24:16.360
Then how can we have...

24:22.576 --> 24:23.774
Oh, my.

24:25.204 --> 24:26.995
- McGee!
- Sir?

24:28.207 --> 24:31.042
- How long's medical school in the UK?
- Four years.

24:32.086 --> 24:33.710
Redirect your search.

24:33.963 --> 24:37.213
Medical postgraduates, '94.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.003
- He's a doctor?
- Ducky thinks so. I'll be in MTAC.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.055
If DiNozzo comes back,
put him under house arrest.

24:45.057 --> 24:46.220
Me?

24:51.480 --> 24:53.473
Today, I'm pleased to welcome.

24:53.566 --> 24:56.317
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
back to the White House.

24:56.402 --> 24:58.893
I think you said
this is our eighth meeting.

24:59.321 --> 25:00.401
Where's Gitmo?

25:00.489 --> 25:02.565
Standing by, sir.
I'll shift her to the main screen.

25:02.658 --> 25:05.742
- No, I'll take it on the headset right here.
- Yes, sir.

25:08.247 --> 25:09.741
Agent Cassidy.

25:10.666 --> 25:12.077
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

25:12.668 --> 25:13.866
Where's Agent Todd?

25:13.961 --> 25:17.081
She's not here.
Why'd she ask for a video conference?

25:17.173 --> 25:19.580
She wanted to discuss
the Hamas Little Creek lead

25:19.675 --> 25:20.838
I gave a while back.

25:20.926 --> 25:22.883
You couldn't do that on the phone?

25:22.970 --> 25:24.429
She wanted face-to-face.

25:24.513 --> 25:25.758
Anything else?

25:25.931 --> 25:27.011
Nope.

25:27.725 --> 25:29.053
Hey, Tony.

25:33.481 --> 25:35.722
I'll get back to you later, Agent Cassidy.

25:35.816 --> 25:37.097
I'm standing by.

25:39.278 --> 25:40.357
Hey, boss.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.361
McGee said you wanted to see me.

25:45.367 --> 25:47.111
Actually, he said
I was under house arrest,

25:47.203 --> 25:50.239
but I figured that was just
your way of making a point.

25:50.789 --> 25:53.707
Do I have to tell you the name
of the creek you're up without a paddle

25:53.792 --> 25:54.991
or how deep it is?

25:55.085 --> 25:56.544
Up to my knees?

25:56.629 --> 25:58.917
So you're familiar with this creek.

25:59.006 --> 26:01.877
Boss, I'm sorry I took a long lunch,
but I'm not working a hot case...

26:01.967 --> 26:04.375
What's a hot case to you, DiNozzo?
Shadowing a tight ass?

26:04.470 --> 26:06.344
- That's not fair, boss...
- War is not fair,

26:06.430 --> 26:08.221
and we are at war.

26:08.766 --> 26:11.435
Until I relieve you,
which may be any moment now,

26:11.519 --> 26:13.310
you will fight that war 24-7!

26:13.395 --> 26:15.637
That includes sleeping,
eating, taking a crap!

26:15.731 --> 26:18.103
- You got it?
- I got it. May I say something?

26:18.192 --> 26:20.979
Only if it has to do with me
catching that bastard I'm chasing.

26:21.070 --> 26:23.062
- It does.
- Then speak.

26:23.989 --> 26:26.824
Boss, you really need to see Moby Dick.

26:53.310 --> 26:55.801
It's on the left side on the belt!

27:02.528 --> 27:03.903
Who's Gibbs?

27:08.909 --> 27:11.400
Who is Gibbs?

27:13.664 --> 27:16.237
My boyfriend.
He calls me when he leaves the office.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.955
- And where does he work?
- Iraq.

27:42.860 --> 27:45.232
Caitlin, did you miss me?

27:52.244 --> 27:54.996
I apologise for Bassam's actions.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.449
At least he didn't blow my shoulder out
with a 9 mil.

27:58.542 --> 28:00.831
Bassam, undo her cuffs.

28:01.378 --> 28:02.872
How is Gerald?

28:03.255 --> 28:06.209
Still in rehab.
Asks every day if you're dead yet.

28:18.437 --> 28:20.928
- Satisfied?
- No.

28:21.023 --> 28:22.303
He smacked me twice.

28:22.608 --> 28:25.811
Being slapped by a woman
is twice the insult to Bassam.

28:25.903 --> 28:28.394
Really? What about being shot by one?

28:29.031 --> 28:30.822
Why did Bassam strike her?

28:31.325 --> 28:33.946
She would not tell
who was calling her cell.

28:36.872 --> 28:38.746
Oh, Gibbs called you.

28:40.042 --> 28:42.580
I better call him back.
Tell him where I am.

28:42.711 --> 28:44.918
- He is my boss.
- Of course.

28:46.173 --> 28:48.213
But first some ice for your lip.

28:48.759 --> 28:50.337
Then you may call him.

28:59.436 --> 29:01.678
- Heard from Kate?
- No.

29:01.897 --> 29:03.724
I tried her home. Not there.

29:04.983 --> 29:06.228
Can you give her a paddle?

29:07.111 --> 29:09.649
It has to do with a creek
Kate and I are up.

29:26.004 --> 29:27.997
You told me I could call Gibbs.

29:28.090 --> 29:29.418
On one condition.

29:31.385 --> 29:33.176
Surprise, surprise.

29:34.346 --> 29:35.888
And what am I to say?

29:38.517 --> 29:40.593
You became quite ill after lunch.

29:41.353 --> 29:42.978
You went to Emergency,

29:43.147 --> 29:45.519
where it was diagnosed
as food poisoning.

29:45.607 --> 29:48.858
They pumped out your stomach,
gave you an IV and sent you home.

29:48.944 --> 29:51.731
You'll be fine tomorrow.
You just need some sleep.

29:52.281 --> 29:53.989
And if I don't say that?

29:55.534 --> 29:56.613
Marta?

29:57.536 --> 30:00.987
Tell our guest how you plan
to entertain Agent DiNozzo tonight.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.786
I will put a bullet in the back of his head

30:07.755 --> 30:10.043
as I run my fingers through his hair.

30:14.636 --> 30:15.881
Tony's right.

30:15.971 --> 30:18.509
Never eat oysters
in a month without an "R."

30:19.224 --> 30:20.968
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

30:24.813 --> 30:26.972
- She okay?
- Food poisoning.

30:27.399 --> 30:28.680
Food poisoning?

30:29.568 --> 30:30.647
I need coffee.

30:30.736 --> 30:32.881
Well, what's wrong,
other than not catching the Hamas guy?

30:32.905 --> 30:37.483
The Hamas guy! The terrorist!
The bastard! The ass!

30:37.785 --> 30:40.572
We call him everything but his name,
DiNozzo. Do you know why?

30:40.662 --> 30:44.078
- Because we don't know his name?
- Because you're not working a hot case.

30:44.416 --> 30:45.910
I want his name!

30:46.627 --> 30:48.037
I want it today!

30:48.962 --> 30:51.085
And don't tell me it's Moby Dick!

30:53.675 --> 30:54.755
Wow.

30:55.010 --> 30:56.488
Kate's right. I think Gibbs is losing it.

30:56.512 --> 30:59.133
You don't really think he meant today,
do you?

31:01.099 --> 31:04.266
This slamming girl
that I'm supposed to take out tonight.

31:04.436 --> 31:07.639
And she's Swedish.
Has this Swede accent.

31:07.731 --> 31:09.356
- Tony?
- Every Swedish girl

31:09.441 --> 31:10.835
I've ever known has always let me...

31:10.859 --> 31:12.235
- Tony!
- What?

31:25.032 --> 31:27.273
It's a very nice chardonnay, Caitlin.

31:27.826 --> 31:29.735
And almost perfectly chilled.

31:30.287 --> 31:31.911
I wish you'd taste it.

31:32.497 --> 31:34.905
- Let her taste it.
- I don't drink.

31:35.584 --> 31:36.782
That's right.

31:37.127 --> 31:38.870
Muslims don't use alcohol.

31:40.047 --> 31:42.004
Well, not at home.

31:42.966 --> 31:47.213
Perhaps if you thought of this
as a weekend house party,

31:47.721 --> 31:49.464
with you as the honoured guest.

31:49.556 --> 31:51.015
And you the charming host?

31:51.099 --> 31:53.092
Oh, many women find me charming.

31:53.185 --> 31:54.762
You must pay them well.

31:57.314 --> 31:58.642
We are leaving.

31:59.066 --> 32:00.441
Do you know?

32:02.944 --> 32:04.107
Do you know what?

32:11.411 --> 32:13.238
It's why I'm here, isn't it?

32:14.289 --> 32:15.700
Where is the pea?

32:25.801 --> 32:29.633
You tell me where the pea is, Caitlin,
and I will answer your question.

32:33.642 --> 32:35.967
- Lucky guess.
- Was it, Caitlin?

32:36.061 --> 32:37.804
No. Now answer my question.

32:38.647 --> 32:41.897
Once more.
To satisfy Marta that it wasn't luck.

32:47.823 --> 32:49.483
I told you, Marta.

32:50.367 --> 32:53.072
Do you detect
slight differences in the shells?

32:53.161 --> 32:54.786
Why am I here?

32:55.080 --> 32:56.704
To teach me this trick.

32:57.499 --> 32:58.910
I'm quite serious.

33:07.342 --> 33:08.505
Amazing.

33:09.136 --> 33:11.591
How did they teach you
to be so observant?

33:11.888 --> 33:12.967
Who?

33:14.141 --> 33:15.339
The Secret Service.

33:22.691 --> 33:25.810
The president is flying to Camp David
with Sharon today.

33:26.528 --> 33:28.070
I saw those missiles.

33:28.488 --> 33:31.158
You want to know which helo
is Marine One to shoot it down.

33:31.533 --> 33:34.450
Those tiny missiles
are mere training aids.

33:36.037 --> 33:40.580
In any case, I have no intention
of shooting down Marine One.

33:40.917 --> 33:42.542
You're a lying bastard.

33:45.881 --> 33:47.079
Sorry.

33:47.507 --> 33:49.915
Unfortunately, half of that is true.

33:52.345 --> 33:54.219
His name is Ari Haswari.

33:54.306 --> 33:57.010
He graduated
from Edinburgh Medical College in '94.

33:57.100 --> 34:01.050
Good lord! So did I.
Well, a few decades earlier, of course.

34:01.146 --> 34:03.388
- Of course.
- Extraordinary.

34:03.481 --> 34:05.474
I wonder if the college
should be informed.

34:05.567 --> 34:07.310
Want to name him
an honoured alumni?

34:07.402 --> 34:09.062
Oh, very amusing, Tony.

34:09.154 --> 34:11.906
But not when we have such notables
as Lord Lister,

34:11.989 --> 34:15.572
Dr. Peter Mark Roget
and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

34:15.659 --> 34:17.237
You have some famous alumni, Ducky.

34:17.329 --> 34:20.532
Well, we should. The medical college
is over 400 years old.

34:20.623 --> 34:25.083
It traces its origins back
to 17th century barber surgeons

34:25.170 --> 34:27.730
- who did blood-letting and...
- I'll be doing some blood-letting

34:27.755 --> 34:29.167
if this huddle isn't work-related.

34:29.257 --> 34:30.650
- Hey, boss, we got him.
- We got a name!

34:30.675 --> 34:32.467
Dr. Ari Haswari.

34:32.552 --> 34:34.841
He's a graduate
of my old medical school in Edinburgh.

34:34.929 --> 34:37.337
That's great work, McGee.
What's with his name?

34:37.431 --> 34:40.433
Ari is Israeli. Haswari is Arab.

34:40.518 --> 34:43.722
Maybe his folks were working
on some sort of Middle East peace plan.

34:43.813 --> 34:45.972
McGee, find someone
who knew him at Edinburgh.

34:46.065 --> 34:47.440
Already did, boss.

34:48.025 --> 34:51.193
I spoke to a Dr. Martin Sedwick,
Pickford Mews, London.

34:51.279 --> 34:53.402
He and Ari were post-graduate
research assistants

34:53.489 --> 34:56.491
at the Edinburgh Centre
for Infectious Diseases.

34:56.784 --> 34:59.988
That's why Hamas chose him
to recover the smallpox virus.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.496
Dr. Sedwick said he was quite brilliant,
always with beautiful women

35:03.583 --> 35:05.825
and always answered to Haswari...

35:06.044 --> 35:07.669
never Ari.

35:07.963 --> 35:11.378
Think I know why.
His father was Dr. Benjamin Weinstein.

35:11.466 --> 35:13.957
His mother, Dr. Hosmiya Haswari.

35:14.052 --> 35:16.294
They worked in Jerusalem Hospital
and never married.

35:17.639 --> 35:21.553
- Haswari didn't like his Jewish daddy.
- You can call him Ari.

35:21.893 --> 35:24.467
Ari worked with his mother
in a Gaza Strip clinic

35:24.562 --> 35:26.105
until she died four years ago.

35:26.189 --> 35:28.347
So he went from doctor to terrorist?

35:28.650 --> 35:30.144
Rantisi was a doctor.

35:30.568 --> 35:32.312
Well, so was Che Guevara.

35:32.404 --> 35:34.277
Jack the Ripper was a surgeon.

35:34.364 --> 35:37.069
No, he was never caught.
That's only a supposition.

35:37.158 --> 35:38.844
You know,
there's a very interesting theory...

35:38.868 --> 35:39.948
Tony, let's go.

35:40.036 --> 35:43.452
McGee, give me a GPS search
on Kate's cell phone. It's off now.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.616
If it comes on, I want coordinates.

35:45.709 --> 35:47.203
Kate's at home, boss.

35:47.294 --> 35:49.120
She didn't answer her phone.

35:49.421 --> 35:51.959
I don't think
she ate bad oysters for lunch.

35:52.048 --> 35:53.590
She had a tuna salad.

35:55.719 --> 35:57.343
Tony, that bastard's got her.

35:57.429 --> 35:59.505
- Boss...
- He's got her!

36:04.269 --> 36:07.638
There's no way to tell them apart.
And if there was, I wouldn't tell you.

36:08.231 --> 36:10.022
Even if it meant your life?

36:10.734 --> 36:14.862
- You willing to die for what you believe?
- We Hamas prove that every day.

36:14.946 --> 36:16.524
No. Your children do.

36:16.823 --> 36:18.981
Marta, give me her gun.

36:20.118 --> 36:23.653
- We're wasting time.
- The gun, Marta. Please.

36:24.664 --> 36:27.036
If killing is to be done, I will do it.

36:30.837 --> 36:32.462
I believe you, Caitlin.

36:33.006 --> 36:35.497
Relax. Have a glass of wine.

36:35.759 --> 36:37.336
I don't like to drink alone.

36:37.427 --> 36:40.463
- Haswari! What...
- Caitlin is telling the truth.

36:41.514 --> 36:44.599
There is no way to identify Marine One
from the others.

36:44.684 --> 36:47.354
- You told me there was.
- I lied.

36:54.361 --> 36:56.852
Women should never get involved
in politics.

36:57.030 --> 36:58.654
It's a waste of beauty.

37:02.327 --> 37:04.818
Call your old friends
at the Secret Service.

37:04.913 --> 37:06.656
I will tell them all they need to know.

37:08.083 --> 37:09.162
Take it.

37:10.085 --> 37:11.495
My Hamas are well trained.

37:11.586 --> 37:14.373
They will kill or capture your president
and mine.

37:19.135 --> 37:20.416
Your president?

37:21.096 --> 37:22.258
I'm Israeli.

37:24.057 --> 37:25.171
Mossad.

37:31.231 --> 37:33.389
A shoot-out today
in Great Falls National Park

37:33.483 --> 37:36.519
between FBI agents
and alleged Colombian drug dealers

37:36.611 --> 37:38.236
led to the death of three suspects

37:38.321 --> 37:39.863
and the wounding of two agents.

37:39.948 --> 37:42.902
One suspect is reported
to have escaped on foot

37:42.992 --> 37:46.159
and a widespread manhunt
is underway throughout the park.

37:46.246 --> 37:48.369
Suspected drug dealers, huh?

37:48.456 --> 37:49.915
Whose idea was that?

37:49.999 --> 37:51.624
Secret Service.

37:52.919 --> 37:56.169
They give Ari his "get out
of jail for free" pass, too?

37:56.256 --> 37:59.422
No. CIA did that.
But all the directors agreed.

37:59.509 --> 38:00.672
Even yours.

38:01.761 --> 38:03.718
Ari's father was Mossad.

38:04.431 --> 38:07.301
Probably knocked his mother up
to get a son with Arab blood.

38:07.767 --> 38:11.183
Sent him to medical school
to vet him as a doctor in Gaza.

38:11.938 --> 38:14.310
This guy's been a sleeper his entire life.

38:14.399 --> 38:16.605
Well, I'd love to put him in a coma.

38:16.818 --> 38:18.775
Al-Qaida funded this Hamas op.

38:19.279 --> 38:22.944
Ari was just doing what he had to do
to make his bones with them.

38:23.366 --> 38:24.741
You tell that to Gerald.

38:24.826 --> 38:26.783
You forget I lost a man,
had three wounded.

38:26.870 --> 38:29.621
- No, but it seems you did.
- You know better than that.

38:29.706 --> 38:32.493
There's a line, Tobias.
That bastard crossed it!

38:32.584 --> 38:34.327
You don't make your bones
shooting friends!

38:34.419 --> 38:36.397
What do you want us to do?
He's inside al-Qaida now!

38:36.421 --> 38:37.619
I don't know!

38:49.309 --> 38:51.634
How the hell do you breathe
in all this dust?

38:51.728 --> 38:53.056
I don't.

38:54.564 --> 38:56.640
You got anything to wash it down?

38:58.318 --> 39:00.891
On the top shelf,
next to the paint stripper.

39:10.413 --> 39:11.955
Who drinks bourbon anymore?

39:12.707 --> 39:14.415
- I do.
- Got a glass?

39:14.709 --> 39:16.120
Use my coffee mug.

39:19.088 --> 39:20.369
What about you?

39:22.800 --> 39:24.544
I use my coffee mug.

39:24.761 --> 39:28.426
You go upstairs and get a glass
or drink out of the bottle.

39:30.767 --> 39:32.047
What the hell.

39:36.564 --> 39:39.269
I see why you keep it
with the paint strippers.

39:39.567 --> 39:43.268
It's 125 proof. You sip it, Fornell.

39:49.536 --> 39:52.406
The directors want your word
that you'll forget about Ari.

39:52.497 --> 39:54.573
They think you'll blow his cover.

39:55.875 --> 39:59.659
If I get payback,
it won't be by blowing his cover.

40:01.548 --> 40:04.383
Why are you asking me this
and not my director?

40:04.884 --> 40:06.378
He refused to.

40:09.222 --> 40:10.597
Yeah.

40:15.228 --> 40:18.145
- All right, one condition.
- There's always one condition.

40:18.231 --> 40:21.896
I want to speak to him,
in a place of my choosing.

40:22.986 --> 40:25.311
- Alone.
- Nobody's gonna go for that.

40:27.532 --> 40:28.777
Ari will.

41:16.289 --> 41:17.617
She was beautiful.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.114
Very.

41:19.459 --> 41:21.202
Did you make love to her?

41:23.296 --> 41:25.170
And then blew her brains out.

41:25.465 --> 41:27.291
She would do the same to me.

41:28.593 --> 41:30.052
Why do you do this?

41:30.470 --> 41:33.257
- Same reason you do.
- I don't think so.

41:35.683 --> 41:37.640
Then you're lying to yourself.

41:41.814 --> 41:43.143
What now?

41:43.691 --> 41:47.440
You go back to the Middle East,
you tell them Marta was Mossad

41:47.528 --> 41:48.987
and that she blew the op.

41:49.072 --> 41:50.186
Yes.

41:50.281 --> 41:53.697
Two op failures in a row.
I'd ax your ass if you worked for me.

41:55.703 --> 41:57.281
People who blow themselves apart

41:57.372 --> 41:59.863
to kill their enemy
have lower expectations.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.117
How do you sell Marta
as a double agent?

42:02.210 --> 42:04.701
My men the FBI permitted to escape,

42:04.796 --> 42:07.287
they know the effort
I put into this operation.

42:07.382 --> 42:10.667
Buying Smoky Sams,
kidnapping Agent Todd,

42:10.760 --> 42:12.966
so I could identify Marine One.

42:13.346 --> 42:15.588
And when they search
Marta's apartment,

42:15.682 --> 42:18.718
they will find money and documents
traceable to Mossad.

42:20.353 --> 42:23.223
Hamas will believe me.
Al-Qaida's more wary.

42:23.314 --> 42:25.058
They don't believe you, you're dead.

42:25.149 --> 42:28.352
Yes. And if they do, I may learn

42:28.444 --> 42:30.437
what they plan as the next 9/11.

42:31.656 --> 42:34.823
Would you risk losing that opportunity...

42:35.702 --> 42:37.030
over pride?

42:37.704 --> 42:39.281
It's not pride.

42:40.415 --> 42:42.158
If not pride, then what?

42:43.251 --> 42:44.745
Love of country?

42:45.545 --> 42:46.790
Sense of duty?

42:48.172 --> 42:49.999
I'm sure those exist in you.

42:50.425 --> 42:53.212
But what burns is pride, my friend.

43:04.355 --> 43:06.846
Just wanted to help you
convince al-Qaida.
