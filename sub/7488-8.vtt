WEBVTT

00:08.990 --> 00:12.730
Okay, off the baby
grand into the tuba.

00:17.570 --> 00:19.740
-Oh yes! -Whoo!

00:19.770 --> 00:22.640
I'll be taking this.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.840
What, there's no playing
ball in the store?

00:24.880 --> 00:27.910
We'll stop playing now. We know
all about your "no fun" rules.

00:29.010 --> 00:31.680
What?

00:31.720 --> 00:34.750
I can have fun. Uh,
I took the ball

00:34.790 --> 00:37.790
'Cause I wanna play.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.690
Grab your bookbags,

00:39.730 --> 00:42.960
You're about to get schooled.

00:48.870 --> 00:51.970
Yeah, no playing
ball in the store.

00:53.010 --> 00:56.810
Guess who's having
a quinceanera?

00:56.850 --> 00:59.620
Oh, I'll take one! Do you
have any chicken quinceanera?

00:59.650 --> 01:01.920
I'm trying to cut
back on red meat.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.960
You're thinking of a quesadilla.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.590
No-oo. <i>Quesadilla</i>

01:06.630 --> 01:07.936
Is a traditional
Latin-American party

01:07.960 --> 01:09.860
Celebrating a girl's
15th birthday.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.670
That's a quinceanera.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.710
And stop trying to
learn other languages.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.580
You can barely speak English.

01:21.850 --> 01:24.980
Trish, I thought you didn't wanna make
a big deal for your 15th birthday.

01:25.020 --> 01:26.980
I don't, but my mom's making me

01:27.020 --> 01:29.620
Because it's a
"family tradition."

01:29.650 --> 01:32.820
I even have to wear this poufy
dress she wore to her quinceanera.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.690
Look.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.630
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with hand-me-downs.

01:40.670 --> 01:44.570
This underwear's been in my
family for six generations.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.770
Ew!

01:45.800 --> 01:48.570
I'm so not looking
forward to this party.

01:48.610 --> 01:49.870
My mom wants to give a speech,

01:49.910 --> 01:51.910
My brother wants to
do his magic act

01:51.940 --> 01:54.850
And my cousin Deb's only coming
to show off her new boyfriend,

01:54.880 --> 01:56.720
"The big club owner."

01:56.750 --> 01:57.926
Whoa whoa whoa, say that again.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.050
I'm so not looking
forward to this party.

02:00.090 --> 02:02.660
- My mom wants to give -No, the
part about the club owner.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.990
Oh, Emilio?

02:04.020 --> 02:05.790
Well, I don't know. I
haven't met him yet.

02:05.830 --> 02:08.860
But apparently he owns like five of
the biggest clubs in the country.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.860
This could be huge for us.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.970
This could be your
first national tour!

02:18.010 --> 02:20.640
Oh, I hope we get
to play in Miami!

02:21.910 --> 02:24.010
We... we live in Miami.

02:24.050 --> 02:26.950
I know, but I love it here.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.020
Listen to you guys. You're
just like everyone else.

02:31.050 --> 02:34.760
You want me to have a quincea? era just
so you can get something out of it.

02:34.790 --> 02:37.860
How selfish is that!

02:37.900 --> 02:41.900
You realize you'll get a
boatload of presents, right?

02:41.930 --> 02:44.870
Guess who's ready to party!

02:51.710 --> 02:53.610
<i>When the crowd wants more</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:54.840
<i>I bring on the thunder</i>

02:54.880 --> 02:56.680
<i>'Cause you've got my back</i>

02:56.710 --> 02:57.910
<i>And I'm not going under</i>

02:57.950 --> 02:59.680
<i>You're my point, you're my guard</i>

02:59.720 --> 03:00.950
<i>You're the perfect chord</i>

03:00.990 --> 03:03.990
<i>And I see our names
together on every billboard</i>

03:04.020 --> 03:07.530
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock</i>

03:07.560 --> 03:08.790
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:08.830 --> 03:10.960
<i>And we'll keep rockin'</i>

03:11.000 --> 03:15.600
<i>Oh, there's no way I
could make it without ya</i>

03:15.630 --> 03:18.640
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya</i>

03:18.670 --> 03:21.700
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo</i>

03:21.740 --> 03:24.710
<i>With you it's like,
"whoa," yeah, and I know</i>

03:24.740 --> 03:27.710
<i>I own this dream</i>

03:27.740 --> 03:30.710
<i>'Cause I got you with me</i>

03:30.750 --> 03:33.820
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya</i>

03:33.850 --> 03:36.989
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:36.990 --> 03:39.990
Austin & Ally S01E08 Club
Owners & Quinceaneras

03:40.960 --> 03:44.730
Trish, this party is about
your entrance into adulthood.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.670
So you should make a grand
entrance to your party.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.630
I've got some ideas.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.000
<i>Here's you entering
on a motorcycle.</i>

03:56.670 --> 03:58.810
<i>Here's you entering
on a jet ski.</i>

04:01.610 --> 04:03.010
Here's you entering
on an elephant.

04:04.950 --> 04:07.850
I'm not riding a
stupid elephant.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.990
Okay. What about a
smart elephant?

04:15.630 --> 04:17.760
Dez, you're wasting my time.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.829
All right, here's a
much simpler idea.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.800
You swing in over the
crowd on a jungle vine

04:21.829 --> 04:25.870
Like an ape man.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.740
Yeah, that's the stupidest
idea I've ever heard.

04:29.740 --> 04:30.840
Oh, Austin,

04:30.880 --> 04:32.540
When you sing at Trish's party,

04:32.580 --> 04:33.826
Do you wanna swing
in on a jungle vine

04:33.850 --> 04:35.550
Like an ape man?

04:35.580 --> 04:37.610
That's the best idea
I've ever heard!

04:40.620 --> 04:43.020
Hmm, go back to my new job

04:43.050 --> 04:45.660
Or hang out with you two apes?

04:45.690 --> 04:48.660
Back to changing diapers
at the day care it is.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:57.940 --> 05:01.770
Okay, you pass out the invites on that
side of the mall and I'll get this side.

05:01.810 --> 05:04.910
You're inviting "girl
from jewelry store"?

05:04.940 --> 05:06.980
You don't even know her name.

05:07.010 --> 05:10.610
I know that a pair of diamond earrings
will make a great quinceanera present.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.880
Trish, that's terrible.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.780
Hey, I need something at this
party to look forward to,

05:15.820 --> 05:17.850
Since apparently it's for
everyone else but me.

05:17.890 --> 05:21.590
My annoying brother still wants
me to let him do his magic act.

05:21.630 --> 05:24.730
Did somebody say magic?

05:24.760 --> 05:26.630
Wh...

05:26.660 --> 05:28.970
-J.J.! -So, Trish,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.770
Have you thought about letting
me perform at your birthday?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.640
You can't even do
a simple trick.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.570
Oh, yeah? Watch.

05:36.580 --> 05:40.040
Now with a little abracadabra...

05:41.610 --> 05:44.780
Voila!

05:44.820 --> 05:48.020
I like that trick. Do it again.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.830
Hey, there's Dallas,

05:55.860 --> 05:57.900
The cute boy from the cell
phone accessory cart.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.600
Act normal.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.940
Hey, Dallas. Catch
the game last night?

06:08.940 --> 06:10.710
What game?

06:11.710 --> 06:14.910
Uh...

06:14.950 --> 06:18.850
You are too funny.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.550
Okay.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.990
Hey, Dallas, I'm having a party.

06:23.020 --> 06:26.560
Black tie optional,
gifts mandatory.

06:26.590 --> 06:27.690
Cool. Can't wait.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.560
I can't believe you did that!

06:31.600 --> 06:33.930
Do you really need cell phone
accessories that badly?

06:33.970 --> 06:37.830
No, I invited him 'cause
you have a crush on him.

06:37.870 --> 06:39.846
But if he doesn't bring me
a sparkly cell phone case,

06:39.870 --> 06:41.810
He's not getting dinner.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.870
But he can't come to your party.

06:43.910 --> 06:46.540
I get so nervous around
him, I can barely talk.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.850
You don't have to talk.
Just dance with him.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.650
They'll play a slow song,
you'll touch hands,

06:52.680 --> 06:54.650
Stare into each other's eyes

06:54.690 --> 06:57.760
And boom! Instant boyfriend.

06:57.790 --> 06:59.796
At least that's how it happens
on that reality show,

06:59.820 --> 07:02.660
"boom! Instant boyfriend."

07:02.690 --> 07:05.560
You know I can't dance, Trish.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.530
I'll have better
luck talking to him.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.600
Sorry, I left my
drink on your table.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.900
Or maybe you left our
table under your drink.

07:17.810 --> 07:19.840
I gotta learn how to dance.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.550
Hey, ally, check
these moves out.

07:27.590 --> 07:29.620
I need an awesome performance
at Trish's party

07:29.660 --> 07:31.620
If I'm gonna score
that national tour.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.000
Whassup?

07:45.970 --> 07:49.010
Wow, I wish I could
dance like that.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.640
Trish thinks I can
win Dallas over

07:50.680 --> 07:51.986
If I dance with
him at her party,

07:52.010 --> 07:53.840
But I've only got one good move.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.850
That's your <i>good</i> move?

08:00.650 --> 08:03.590
I must be the worst dancer
in the history of dancing.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.020
Oh, that's not true.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.530
Dancing's been around forever.
There must be someone worse.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.730
Gee, thanks.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.630
Look, don't worry about
dancing with Dallas.

08:13.670 --> 08:15.800
Slow dancing is easy. Just
follow the guy's lead.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.540
Do you think you could show me?

08:17.570 --> 08:18.770
Sure.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.510
-Okay, ready? -Okay.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.810
Right about there.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.780
Oh, sorry, I just
stepped on your foot.

08:27.810 --> 08:30.650
Actually that was your foot.

08:32.690 --> 08:34.890
Just follow me. You can do this.

08:38.730 --> 08:40.630
Hey, I'm getting
the hang of this.

08:40.659 --> 08:43.600
- Okay, now I'm gonna spin you.
- No no no! Oh.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.740
Oh! This is hopeless.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.810
There's no way I'm dancing
at the party tomorrow.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.810
Yeah. And neither am I.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.610
Don't worry, Austin.
Dr. Dez is here.

09:08.650 --> 09:11.850
Rule ♪1 for a sprain...
you've gotta put ice on it.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.490
Ow!

09:16.520 --> 09:19.690
Okay, that doesn't
seem to be working.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.460
Uh, let's try acupuncture.

09:23.490 --> 09:24.730
You know what?

09:24.760 --> 09:27.700
I'm good.

09:27.730 --> 09:30.900
Man, this stinks. How am
I supposed to perform

09:30.940 --> 09:33.570
At Trish's party if I
can't even stand up?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.810
That Emilio guy is never
gonna book me at his clubs.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.670
I've got it!

09:38.710 --> 09:40.586
We already have the jungle
vine for your entrance.

09:40.610 --> 09:43.680
Why don't you do the entire
show flying above the crowd?

09:43.710 --> 09:45.910
The jungle vine thing is cool.

09:45.950 --> 09:48.520
Austin, I am so sorry.

09:48.550 --> 09:50.490
Nobody feels worse
about this than I do.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.526
Well, you probably do because
you have a sprained ankle,

09:52.550 --> 09:54.660
But I'm a close second.

09:54.690 --> 09:57.490
It's okay, ally. Dez
came up with a way

09:57.530 --> 09:58.836
For me to still give
a cool performance.

09:58.860 --> 10:01.660
At least the party won't
be ruined for both of us.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.500
You're still gonna
dance with Dallas.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.600
I'll coach you.
Dez, you be Dallas.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.600
Ally, you be ally.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.770
Aw, I want to be ally.

10:11.870 --> 10:14.580
Dez, we've talked about this.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.780
Fine, I'll be Dallas.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.820
Hey, ally. You
always stare at me

10:23.850 --> 10:26.550
And say weird things.
Wanna dance?

10:29.660 --> 10:32.630
It's not quite how I
imagined the moment,

10:32.660 --> 10:34.000
But okay.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.970
Okay, just follow Dez's lead.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.570
A simple one-two one-two.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.670
You're going too fast!

10:42.700 --> 10:44.640
It's a slow dance.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.640
One, two.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.850
Okay, let's call
it a medium dance.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.020
There you go, ally.
You're doing it!

10:57.050 --> 10:59.590
You're gonna be great
at this party.

10:59.620 --> 11:00.820
Now let's try a spin.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.690
Oh, I love this part!

11:16.610 --> 11:19.880
Wow, Trish's mom
really went all out.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.980
I feel so bad. I forgot
to bring her a present.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.550
I don't think she'll notice.

11:28.650 --> 11:31.720
Do you see Dallas? I can't
wait to dance with him.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.560
I wonder if Emilio is here yet.

11:33.590 --> 11:35.690
I can't wait to show
him my performance.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.960
Why are you wearing
that poufy suit?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.830
You saw Trish's dress.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.030
I thought everyone has
to wear poufy stuff.

11:48.010 --> 11:50.740
Ooh, Trish is about to
make her big entrance.

11:50.780 --> 11:53.680
We want to thank all
our family and friends

11:53.710 --> 11:55.680
For coming to Trish's
quinceanera.

11:55.710 --> 11:58.680
Now introducing the
birthday girl,

11:58.720 --> 12:01.690
Patricia maria de la rosa.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.920
Who?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.890
I thought we were
here for Trish.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.820
I can't wait to see
Trish's new dress.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.560
She didn't wanna wear her mom's

12:09.590 --> 12:11.630
Because it wasn't her style.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.570
Oh, that's much more Trish.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.800
She looks great.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.640
Yeah, zebra
<i>definitely her color.</i>

12:22.670 --> 12:26.710
We're so proud of Trish.
She's such a hard worker.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.680
I remember when she
got her first job

12:29.710 --> 12:31.650
At the bookstore and
then the next day

12:31.680 --> 12:32.980
She got a job at the bakery

12:33.020 --> 12:35.650
And then an hour later she quit
and got a job at the pet shop,

12:35.690 --> 12:37.550
-And... Okay, mom! -oh.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.660
Let's get to the gifts. Whoo!

12:40.690 --> 12:42.790
Honey, it's not
about the presents.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.830
Tonight is a magical night.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.630
Did somebody say magic?

12:49.630 --> 12:51.930
It's time for the
traditional first dance.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.940
Please join Trish and her
father on the dance floor.

13:02.610 --> 13:04.780
Now's your chance to
dance with Dallas.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.780
-I'm nervous. -Don't be.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.720
You were great dancing
yesterday with Dez.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.820
-Just pretend Dallas is Dez.
-A-all right.

13:10.850 --> 13:13.820
-It's just a slow dance.
-Quit stalling.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.660
Stalling? I am not stalling.

13:16.690 --> 13:18.560
"stalling," that's a funny word.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.906
Bet you can't say it 10 times fast...
stalling stalling stalling

13:20.930 --> 13:22.670
-Stalling stalling... ally!

13:22.700 --> 13:23.930
Okay, I'll... I'll ask him,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.940
But this song is almost over.
I'll just have to wait

13:26.970 --> 13:28.870
Until they play
another slow song.

13:35.710 --> 13:38.710
I can't believe they haven't
played another slow song!

13:38.750 --> 13:41.720
It's been two hours, the
party's almost over.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.520
I can't believe Emilio
hasn't shown up yet.

13:44.550 --> 13:47.760
I can't believe how many shrimp
I can fit in my poufy pants.

13:48.890 --> 13:52.530
Austin, Emilio's gonna
be here in 15 minutes.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.700
We only have enough
time to play one song

13:54.730 --> 13:55.976
'Cause we lose this
space at 10:00.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.800
I'll go get the
jungle vine ready.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.826
They're finally
playing a slow song.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.890
Now's your chance to
dance with Dallas.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.850
I'm going.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.860
B-but I don't want
you guys watching.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.890
- I'm already nervous enough.
- Okay, we won't watch.

14:25.870 --> 14:27.970
Uh, hey, Dallas.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.630
Hi, ally.

14:29.670 --> 14:33.700
Fun party, huh?
Listen to this music.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.840
It really puts me
in a dancing mood.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.980
Would you look at that?

14:42.010 --> 14:45.620
Didn't even realize
I was dancing.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.990
Weird, right? Just me...

14:48.020 --> 14:50.790
Dancing...

14:50.820 --> 14:53.930
All by myself.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.930
Okay, this is ridiculous.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.600
Do you wanna dance with me?

14:58.630 --> 15:00.570
No, thanks.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.940
Oh, phew. I don't know
why I was so nervous.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.770
I feel so much...

15:04.800 --> 15:07.640
Wait, did you just say no?

15:07.670 --> 15:08.940
Yeah. Sorry.

15:12.850 --> 15:14.850
Wait up.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.880
Ally, I'm so sorry.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.890
It's okay.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.590
This night isn't about me.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.560
Austin's gonna give
a great performance

15:26.590 --> 15:29.760
And Trish, you got a huge cake
and a table full of presents.

15:29.790 --> 15:31.600
Everything's fine.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.860
Look out!

15:43.770 --> 15:46.680
See? Everything's fine!

15:57.960 --> 15:59.730
Dez, are you okay?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.930
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.530
I was testing out the jungle
vine and it accidentally untied.

16:05.570 --> 16:08.730
This is terrible! You
destroyed my presents,

16:08.770 --> 16:10.700
You broke the deejay's turntable

16:10.740 --> 16:12.540
And people are
starting to leave.

16:12.570 --> 16:15.540
By the time Emilio gets here,
everyone's gonna be gone.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.940
I don't want him to see me
perform without an audience.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.910
Get them to stick around for 10 more
minutes while I go talk to ally.

16:20.950 --> 16:23.920
How am I gonna get everyone to stay?
I'm not a magician.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.790
Did somebody say magician?

16:28.720 --> 16:30.930
Fine, you can do your magic.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.830
But no card tricks.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.640
And I will now cut
my sister in half.

16:40.670 --> 16:44.010
Do a card trick.
Do a card trick!

16:45.610 --> 16:49.550
Now with a little abracadabra...

16:49.580 --> 16:53.780
<i>and a little more abracadabra...</i>

16:58.920 --> 17:00.550
Oh.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.560
Voila!

17:03.690 --> 17:06.460
Bravo. Now put me back together.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.760
Yeah, uh,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.829
About that...

17:12.630 --> 17:15.540
Ally, where are you? I've
been looking all over.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.869
Under where?

17:17.910 --> 17:20.910
I just said "underwear."

17:21.940 --> 17:24.910
-I'm under here! -Oh.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.590
-Why are you hiding?
-I'm so embarrassed.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.630
I can't show my face
in front of Dallas.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.830
Forget about him.
He's not that great.

17:38.860 --> 17:40.730
You're right.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.860
I don't even remember
why I like him.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.970
Just because he has dark hair

17:45.000 --> 17:48.640
And kind eyes and a great smile.

17:48.670 --> 17:51.740
Okay, I remember exactly
why I like him.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.840
That guy doesn't know what he's missing.
You're awesome.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.550
Hey, guys.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.550
Austin, Emilio finally got here.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.796
You've gotta sing your song now.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.690
Hang on, I'm talking to ally.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.720
There's no time. They're already
starting to clean this place up.

18:09.860 --> 18:11.660
Oh...

18:11.700 --> 18:13.500
You gonna be okay?

18:13.530 --> 18:15.900
Yeah. Go kick some butt

18:15.930 --> 18:17.930
And get yourself
booked in those clubs.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.470
"making someone disappear,"

18:23.510 --> 18:26.910
"turning someone
into a chicken"...

18:28.880 --> 18:31.580
Nothing on putting
someone back together!

18:32.750 --> 18:34.550
J.J., show's over.
I've gotta perform.

18:34.590 --> 18:36.620
He has to put me back together!

18:36.660 --> 18:37.690
There's no time!

18:37.720 --> 18:39.830
Wh-what about my legs?!

18:41.730 --> 18:43.530
That's Emilio in the green tie.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.700
Thanks.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.970
Hey, everybody, I'm Austin moon!

18:56.540 --> 18:59.610
Thanks for staying... especially
Emilio, the club owner.

19:01.950 --> 19:05.620
I'm gonna sing a song for you.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.700
You know what? Stop.

19:18.730 --> 19:20.670
I really wanted to
sing for you guys,

19:20.700 --> 19:22.870
But there's only
time for one song

19:22.900 --> 19:25.870
And I'd rather spend that time
dancing with one of my best friends.

19:25.910 --> 19:28.740
Aw, man, so sweet.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.780
Not you.

19:30.810 --> 19:32.710
Ally.

19:34.580 --> 19:36.950
Uh...

19:38.550 --> 19:39.850
Austin, what are you doing?

19:39.890 --> 19:41.820
You're missing your
chance with Emilio.

19:41.860 --> 19:46.560
Hey, it's more important that the coolest
girl here finally gets her dance.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.860
Hit it!

20:01.010 --> 20:04.610
Oh, thanks, Austin.
This is so sweet.

20:04.650 --> 20:06.650
Okay, ready? Time for the dip.

20:06.680 --> 20:10.590
Don't worry, you can trust me.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.690
Party's over!

20:13.960 --> 20:16.660
Sorry. You can trust me

20:16.690 --> 20:18.830
When someone doesn't blast
an air horn in my ear.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.900
Thanks for coming!

20:22.930 --> 20:25.630
There better be gift
receipts in those boxes!

20:26.630 --> 20:28.770
Deb, Emilio! You made it.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.670
So sorry, Trish. There was a
problem at one of my clubs.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.740
Some guy got mad
on the 13th hole

20:33.770 --> 20:35.780
And drove a golf
cart into the lake.

20:35.810 --> 20:37.640
Whoa, cool!

20:37.680 --> 20:40.680
You have golf carts and
lakes at your nightclubs?

20:40.720 --> 20:43.580
Nightclubs? I own country clubs.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.020
Oh-hh.

20:46.050 --> 20:48.020
Excuse me, sir. I'm Austin moon.

20:48.060 --> 20:50.630
I'm sorry I didn't get to
perform for you tonight,

20:50.660 --> 20:52.576
But I was really hoping to
play at one of your clubs.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.860
Sure, son. How's 6:00 a.m.
Tomorrow?

20:54.900 --> 20:58.030
I usually don't play
that early, but okay.

20:58.070 --> 21:02.670
Austin, he owns country
clubs, not nightclubs.

21:02.710 --> 21:05.740
Oh-hh.

21:05.780 --> 21:09.710
Yeah, I don't play golf
or get up at 6:00 a.m.

21:09.750 --> 21:10.980
But thanks for the invite.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.720
No problem.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.690
Sorry this night didn't
work out, Austin.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.690
I still had fun. I got to
hang out with my friends,

21:20.720 --> 21:22.790
Eat some shrimp
from Dez's pants.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.760
And I learned a little <i>espanol.</i>

21:24.800 --> 21:27.760
<i>? hola Still in here!</i>

21:27.800 --> 21:30.600
We gotta figure out a way to
put you back together, Trish.

21:30.630 --> 21:33.000
Whoa, not so fast. I gotta
say I like hanging out

21:33.040 --> 21:34.770
With this half of
Trish much better.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.910
Hilarious.

21:35.940 --> 21:37.910
Oof... ow!

21:43.580 --> 21:44.920
Hey, ally.

21:45.950 --> 21:47.750
Oh, hey.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.590
You're a really great dancer.

21:49.620 --> 21:51.896
I could never have pulled that off.
That's why I said no to you.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.690
I mean, I wanted to dance with you.
I just don't know how.

21:55.730 --> 21:59.800
Wait a minute. You can't dance?

21:59.830 --> 22:02.730
-That is amazing! -It is?!

22:02.770 --> 22:04.700
Yeah. I can't dance either.
Look.

22:06.670 --> 22:08.710
Oh, wow. That is pretty bad.

22:08.740 --> 22:10.940
But not worse than this.

22:10.980 --> 22:13.640
Okay okay.

22:15.980 --> 22:17.780
Yeah, or what about...

22:17.810 --> 22:19.780
Well, tonight was a bust.

22:19.820 --> 22:23.000
Looks like I'm not going on a
national tour anytime soon.

22:23.230 --> 22:25.730
Yeah, and all I have
are broken presents.

22:27.570 --> 22:29.080
They are not all broken.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.220
Yeah, they're all broken.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.930
Well, tonight
sounds a total loss

22:38.170 --> 22:39.930
At least Ally came
out the winner

22:42.100 --> 22:43.520
On second thought

22:43.970 --> 22:45.340
Maybe there are no winners.
