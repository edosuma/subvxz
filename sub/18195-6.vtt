00:02.280 --> 00:05.317
You know that old song
they always used to play on the radio,

00:05.400 --> 00:07.755
about how first love never dies?

00:07.840 --> 00:10.479
Shite song, but it is sort of true.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.870
My first love was Sally Evans,
when I was seven.

00:13.960 --> 00:19.318
Here's how it is, Adam Williams. Either you
give me a kiss, or the hamster dies.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.712
I think my first big crush
was probably Jean-Pierre.

00:24.680 --> 00:27.558
A French exchange student,
when I was about 14.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.518
Oh, God, he was so mature and dreamy.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.876
He could blow smoke-rings and drink Pernod
without retching.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.188
Alors, tiens...

00:42.040 --> 00:45.316
I suppose my first proper love
would have been Jennifer Priday.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.078
Proud, haughty, skittish.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.116
Like a wild, untamed horse.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.794
There was nothlng I wouldn't do
for Jennifer Priday.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.351
<i>Hello, Jennifer. I wonder, would you
come to the sixth-form dance with me?</i>

01:01.240 --> 01:03.196
Kevin Johnson.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.113
Even saying the name now, I get the shivers.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.636
He was a god.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.952
He just seemed so charismatic,

01:16.040 --> 01:20.238
and funny and talented

01:20.320 --> 01:26.295
and just full of all these amazing,
philosophical provocative insights.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.029
Do you know,
when you buy a chicken with giblets in,

01:30.120 --> 01:33.954
the giblets don't actually belong
to that particular chicken, huh?

01:37.960 --> 01:40.076
I'm not sure I should say this.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.591
Bridget Patterson.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.592
She was amazing. We were inseparable.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.752
I wrote her name on my pencil case.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.311
So, who do you reckon'll still be around
in 15 years' time?

01:56.680 --> 01:59.911
Curiosity Killed The Cat, or Haircut 100?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.991
Jen?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.389
What are you staring at?

02:10.400 --> 02:13.597
My first big, proper love -
well, the most important one -

02:13.680 --> 02:15.591
would probably have to be Jenny.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.353
No-one before, no-one since.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.909
Paris?
- No.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.638
Milan?
- No.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.030
It's not Blackpool, is it?
- Don't be daft! You can't fly to Blackpool.

02:30.120 --> 02:33.078
Trust me. Just put yourself entirely
in my hands.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.593
That's reassuring.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.433
So, where are we meeting everyone?
- Uh, everyone...

02:38.560 --> 02:41.597
Well, you know, Rutters.
- Can't make it. Family commitments.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.079
Wanker! Carcey?

02:43.160 --> 02:48.314
Toothache. The Hawk can't afford it,
and Bucket is tiling his bathroom.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.238
So, this riotous stag weekend
is just you and me?

02:52.320 --> 02:54.151
And David.
- David?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.151
Oh, yeah, he's up for it. Mad for it.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.028
Strippers and getting wrecked
is right up his street!

03:00.120 --> 03:03.954
Sorry I'm late! Here we all are, then.
The three musketeers.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.996
Let mayhem and madness commence!

03:07.800 --> 03:10.030
All for one...

03:10.120 --> 03:13.908
<i>Set in 200 acres of rolling countryside,</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:17.151
<i>Faversham Hall incorporates
the finest hotel environment</i>

03:17.240 --> 03:19.549
<i>with the best in health
and beauty facilities.</i>

03:19.640 --> 03:24.873
<i>Work out in our gym, then unwind with
a facial, a sauna or a soothing massage.</i>

03:24.960 --> 03:30.876
<i>Then, in the evening, why not relax with a fag,
a pint and a pasty in our new karaoke cafe?</i>

03:30.960 --> 03:33.030
<i>I made that bit up, obviously.</i>

03:33.120 --> 03:34.394
Lisbon?
- No.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.198
Please God, not Amsterdam.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.191
Look, it begins with a B.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.599
Barcelona?
- No.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.908
Berlin?
- No.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.718
Bilbao, for the Guggenheim?
- No!

03:45.120 --> 03:48.908
Hello. We've got a reservation
under the name of Bradley.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.911
<i>Certainly, madam.</i>

03:51.000 --> 03:53.275
Are there no fellas here, then?

03:53.360 --> 03:56.830
Well, no, we don't actually allow gentlemen
on the premises.

03:56.920 --> 04:01.471
Oh, right.
What about staff? What about cleaners?

04:01.560 --> 04:04.757
Absolutely none. Ladies only.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.400
Jen, what do we need men for?

04:07.480 --> 04:12.395
For snogging, Rachel. You have to get drunk
and snog a stranger on your hen night.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.152
It's the law.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.190
Belfast?

04:18.279 --> 04:19.918
We're going to Belfast?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.558
Was Beirut all booked up?

04:21.640 --> 04:23.756
That's my home country you're talking about.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.196
I thought you'd be pleased.
You always go on about how brilliant it was.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.191
It is brilliant. I am. I love it. But...

04:29.280 --> 04:32.556
I didn't think I'd be spending my stag
with my Great-Aunt Peggy.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.312
It won't be like that.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.916
I just thought it'd be a nice way
to say a fond farewell to distant memories.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.355
Peter, you make it sound like I'm dying.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.953
You are a bit.

04:47.320 --> 04:52.314
Right. I think I'm going to start
with a wax bath,

04:52.400 --> 04:55.597
then some hydrotherapy and a seaweed wrap.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.591
What's a seaweed wrap?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.318
They wrap you in seaweed.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.311
Nice.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.550
<i>Welcome to Belfast Airport.</i>

05:05.640 --> 05:11.078
So, this is it, boys. Your final farewell to
freedom, happiness and independence

05:11.160 --> 05:16.439
before life becomes a mind-numbing routine
of bitter, resentful sex.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.034
It's your stag weekend. This is
a celebration!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.834
Oh, superb! Hello, there, I'm Adam Williams,
the groom-to-be.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.638
Whoa! Groom-to-be?

05:26.720 --> 05:29.280
Is this a stag party?
- Not strictly, no.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.999
Who's Mr Peter Gifford?
- That's me.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.914
I was told I was going to be escorting
three businessmen on a two-day conference.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.069
Did I say that?

05:37.160 --> 05:39.833
But we are businessmen.
I'm a management consultant,

05:39.920 --> 05:42.514
Mr Williams is in computers,
and Mr Gifford...

05:44.080 --> 05:45.991
What is it you do?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.674
So this isn't a stag party, then?

05:48.760 --> 05:52.912
Well, yes, I suppose technically
it is a stag party, but...

05:53.000 --> 05:56.117
Perfect. Absolutely bloody perfect.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.555
Right. Follow me.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.473
All right. My name is Roy.
I'm your driver for the weekend.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.073
The conditions are as follows.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.391
No feet on the seats, no singing
in the back,

06:14.480 --> 06:17.517
if one of you throws up,
you clean up and pay for a valet service.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.795
No fried or fatty foods in the car.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.396
No political discussions, no punch-ups,
and no picking up strange women.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.311
Agreed?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.391
Agreed.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.269
Right. Welcome to Northern Ireland. Get in.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.197
<i>So, what's our itinerary?</i>

06:36.280 --> 06:39.955
<i>I thought you might want to show us
some places of historical interest.</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:48.352
Summer of '84,
142 McMasters Street, Jackie Brooker.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.716
Christmas '82, Alison Smith.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.638
130 Parker Street, Carol Taylor.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.558
Oh, my God.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.676
Adam...

07:04.760 --> 07:08.116
So, who do you think does the best murals -
Catholics or Protestants?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.839
Will you pack it in, will you?
- No, I'm just interested.

07:12.040 --> 07:19.071
This was a major one when I was 16.
Sarah Squires. Lovely Sarah Squires.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.515
Shame that didn't work out.
- Why, what happened?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.192
There was too much against us.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.636
Our families and the community
didn't approve.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.314
It was a Romeo and Juliet sort of thing.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.311
Forbidden love.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.755
You can't fight bigotry like that.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.274
Because you were Protestant
and she was Catholic?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.796
No, she was my geography teacher.
- Ah.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.359
Pub.
- Yes.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.633
Adam, this pub - is it Catholic
or Protestant?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.393
It's a pub, David. It doesn't have
a religion.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.950
Am I likely to face any hostility,
with my accent?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.553
Your accent?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.677
Actually, he may have a point.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.231
Oh, God, yeah, this bar...

08:05.320 --> 08:08.153
In here, you might want to do something
about your accent.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.510
Come on. Your round.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:22.200 --> 08:27.149
Uh, tree points of your Guinness, please.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.793
So when you lived here,
did you just get off with girls?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.075
No, I played pool...

08:40.120 --> 08:43.794
Anyway, these weren't just silly
flirtations. This was big love.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.075
Especially with Jane Fitzpatrick.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.749
Oh, yes, the legendary Jane Fitzpatrick.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.871
Who was Jane Fitzpatrick?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.997
A girl I met on my school holidays
over here.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.436
She was beautiful. Amazing.
The love of my life.

08:59.520 --> 09:04.548
The one and only girl, before Rachel,
that I could imagine being with for ever.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.996
So what went wrong?
- It was very sad and complicated.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.277
He got off with Nicky Chadwin.
- I got off with Nicky Chadwin.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.434
Do you think it's possible
to drink six litres of water a day?

09:28.640 --> 09:29.993
<i>Why?</i>

09:30.080 --> 09:34.835
It says here the secret of a model's perfect
skin is to drink six litres of water a day.

09:34.920 --> 09:39.550
Karen, will you shut up?
They said we had to keep perfectly still.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.476
How much is six litres, then?
- 13 pints.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.552
Come on, you can't drink 13 pints of water.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.716
Not unless you're drowning.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.551
Bloody hell, I'm starving. When's lunch?

10:07.320 --> 10:10.471
Ask him to change the music.
- You ask him.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.471
I can't. Adam, you ask him.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.074
Why can't you ask him?
- I'm scared of him.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.355
All right back there, lads?

10:17.440 --> 10:19.510
Oh, yeah, great.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.592
The music all right for you?
- Very much so.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.916
Are we nearly there yet? I'm busting!

10:32.000 --> 10:35.231
So, the Irish giant Finn McCool,

10:35.320 --> 10:39.711
hearing that the Scots giant was stronger,
challenged him to a fight.

10:39.800 --> 10:44.237
He built the causeway so that the cowardly
Scot could cross the sea to do battle.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.074
Do you know what happened to that
clod of earth that fell into the sea?

10:50.440 --> 10:51.509
No.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.716
That became the Isle of Man.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.677
You're joking!

10:56.840 --> 10:59.115
No, Pete, it actually happened.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.829
All right, then, what about
the Isle of Wight?

11:02.920 --> 11:04.797
Do you want me to finish this story or not?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.479
Well, maybe.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.599
All right, forget it. Follow me.
I'll lead you to another local legend.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.753
The bench! It's gotta be here somewhere.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.990
Look, what are you looking for?

11:19.080 --> 11:22.755
Ah, look! Here it is! - You do realise
you've spelt ''love'' wrong.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.149
Adam Williams 4 Jane Fitzpatrick, true luv.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.593
What's so special about this?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.478
This is where Adam Williams lost
his virginity.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.357
Funny, it's not in the tourist guide.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.351
On a wooden bench?

11:33.440 --> 11:35.351
That's dead classy, that is.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.477
We had a bottle of cider and a sleeping bag.
It was very romantic.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.394
It is National Trust. It's a rather fine place
for it. All that natural beauty.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.357
The scenery's not bad, either.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.035
I think it's disgusting!
- Where'd you lose your virginity?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.795
In my mum and dad's bed,
like most normal people.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.837
I tell you what, doing bugger-all
takes it out of you, doesn't it?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.831
Mm.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.514
<i>Nice place, though.
- Isn't it?</i>

12:08.600 --> 12:11.910
Yeah. How are you feeling?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.911
Very relaxed.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.752
You?

12:15.840 --> 12:17.910
Very relaxed, yeah.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.473
Sort of in a coma. Are you bored?

12:22.600 --> 12:27.037
God, yes! All these people
wandering around in gowns, smiling.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.031
It's like a lunatic asylum with sun beds.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.873
I just wanted to have a drink and a laugh,

12:31.960 --> 12:35.111
make embarrassing sexual revelations.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.633
What shall we do?

12:36.720 --> 12:38.995
I don't know. Food fight?

12:39.080 --> 12:42.152
Can you have a food fight with organic food?

12:42.240 --> 12:45.949
Hi. God, this is great, isn't it?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.110
Smashing.
- Yeah, it's lovely.

12:48.200 --> 12:53.149
I've just checked at reception. There's
an Alexander Technique class in 20 minutes.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.073
Brilliant! What's that, then?

12:56.160 --> 12:59.596
Um, it's all about
the correct alignment of your body.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.478
Good, because my body alignment's knackered.

13:03.560 --> 13:08.759
Er... I don't suppose you found out
if there's a pub nearby, did you?

13:08.840 --> 13:10.671
A pub?

13:10.760 --> 13:13.718
Yeah. It's just that me and Jen,
we're a bit...

13:13.800 --> 13:15.756
Bored.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.229
Bored?
- Bored.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.438
Listen, it's great, all this detoxing.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.636
I think my body's craving something toxic.

13:26.880 --> 13:31.271
Right. My room, five minutes,
bring your minibar.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.596
Ha-ha-ha!
- Are you sure this is the place?

13:36.680 --> 13:38.591
Oh, God! This is the one!

13:38.680 --> 13:40.159
It used to be packed every night.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.993
It looks dead to me. Is it still open?
- Aye, it should be.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.310
Adam, Adam! That's what happens.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.516
Things change. People move on.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.989
Maybe we should call it a night,
go to the hotel.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.991
No!

13:52.080 --> 13:55.470
Let's have a quick pint.
If it's dead, we'll head back.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.516
Jeez...

14:08.000 --> 14:11.151
I knew you didn't have tonsillitis,
you bollocks!

14:16.480 --> 14:19.995
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

14:25.240 --> 14:27.196
Right, I need a bottle.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.198
Here's one.
- It's not empty!

14:36.680 --> 14:38.591
It is now.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.275
Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Of course it's a good idea.

14:42.360 --> 14:46.478
Whenever I play this, someone ends up crying.
- Bollocks, we'll be fine.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.551
Does anybody know the rules?

14:48.640 --> 14:53.873
Are we playing truth or dare, or truth, dare,
double-dare, love, kiss or promise?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.473
Say that again?

14:55.560 --> 14:57.790
I don't think I can. I'll spin.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.469
Oh, no! Why me?

15:09.560 --> 15:13.269
Look, look, there. I've pulled, definitely.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.272
Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.238
Pete, here, listen...
- Look, look, look.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.914
Finally found someone daft enough
to marry you, then?

15:25.080 --> 15:27.036
How are you, Adam?

15:31.720 --> 15:35.952
Pete, David...this is Jane Fitzpatrick.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.752
What, the Jane?
- The Jane.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.195
Bench Jane?
- Bench Jane?

15:41.280 --> 15:44.477
Another drink?
- Yeah, cheers.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.676
What, bench Jane, the one you lost your...

15:46.760 --> 15:48.671
Thank you, Pete.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.715
My God, you look fantastic.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.153
So do you. I see the spots have cleared up.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.356
Oh, and your er...puppy fat's just...

16:05.440 --> 16:09.592
Adam, come over here. You wouldn't believe
who wants to see you! Come on!

16:09.680 --> 16:12.240
Don't go away, Jane Fitzpatrick!
- I'm going nowhere.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.999
You've some nerve coming back here
after what you did.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.197
Oh, er... Us breaking up?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.669
Are you stll going on about Nicky Chadwin?

16:25.760 --> 16:27.113
No, God, not that.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.112
What? Nicky Chadwin, remember?
- Oh, Nicky Chadwin. Tasty.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.751
You don't remember, do you?
New Year's Eve, 1999? The Millennium?

16:37.160 --> 16:40.948
When we were going out, we swore
if we ever broke up we would meet again

16:41.040 --> 16:43.759
at the stroke of midnight, 1999.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.277
Oh, yes, yes. The Giant's Causeway.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.112
Right, so, New Year's Eve's come round

16:51.200 --> 16:56.433
and...I know it's a long shot, but I'm thinking
Adam's a man of his word, he'll be there.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.512
So, I snuck out of the house,
told Mum I was going to a party,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.033
and I went down to the Causeway.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.874
It must have been the bleakest,
wettest night of the year.

17:04.960 --> 17:10.829
And I sat there on our bench,
and I waited and waited and waited.

17:12.280 --> 17:17.069
I could see the fireworks across the bay, hear
the cheers of celebration. I knew it was midnight.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.675
But you never came.

17:20.760 --> 17:24.069
I waited for you, Adam, and you never came.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.188
Are you taking the piss?
- Course I am.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.158
You are the bollocks. You are the bollocks!

17:34.240 --> 17:39.109
Do you honestly think I'd hang around for
a bollocks like you? I was here at a party.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.919
Yes, well, you know, shame,
because I was at the Causeway.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.230
Oh, really? With your fiancee, I suppose?

17:48.440 --> 17:49.919
What's she like, then?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.520
Rachel? She's cool.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.353
She's very cool.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.479
Excellent!
- Wooh!

18:16.560 --> 18:18.516
Oh, great!

18:18.600 --> 18:21.160
A lot longer than I remember.
- Thank you.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.879
There we are, Pete, Roy.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.235
Ah, lovely.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.153
So, um...where's your husband?

18:29.240 --> 18:32.232
Oh, he's on holiday...with his fiancee.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.759
Oh, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.718
No, it was great. For the first week or so.

18:37.800 --> 18:42.476
<i>He was a nice guy. He just had a wee problem
with the fidelity part, that's all.</i>

18:42.560 --> 18:46.758
I've always had trouble with these shallow,
feckless, emotionally immature men.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.592
Thanks very much.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.355
Still, don't let me put you off- marriage is fine.
I'm sure you'll be great at it.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.796
I bet you've even got a picture in
your wallet, and everything.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.394
Actually, I do.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.990
Well, when did we get so corny and romantic?

19:03.080 --> 19:05.435
I was always corny and romantic.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.908
Yeah, I suppose you were. If I
remember rightly,

19:09.000 --> 19:13.516
you were like that with every girl
in County Antrim and Greater Manchester.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.636
I am a reformed man now.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.474
Is that right? Come on, then, show me.
- What?

19:19.560 --> 19:21.471
Where is that pocket? Come on, get it out.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.394
It's um... There she is.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.716
She's a beautiful girl.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.756
Yes, she is.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.596
You should come to the wedding.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.552
No!

19:39.640 --> 19:43.713
You could have a special table at the
reception with all your ex-girlfriends on it.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.917
It could be a very long table.
We could compare notes.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.878
Actually, there weren't that many.
Not like you, anyway.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.796
You were my first love, Jane.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.596
Really?
- Yes.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.834
Go and get me a drink, you soppy bugger.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.798
Going. Going now.
- Go. Go on. Leave.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.030
Off you pop. Go!

20:12.720 --> 20:15.439
Why do I feeI like I'm in The Deer Hunter?

20:15.520 --> 20:17.317
Go past, go past...

20:20.720 --> 20:22.438
Shit!

20:22.520 --> 20:25.353
Right, whose go is it to choose?
- Mine, I think.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.396
Be nice, please.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.195
OK, let me think. Hm... Ah, truth.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.869
Can't I just wear my pants on my head?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.598
No. Truth, I think.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.517
OK, here we go.

20:40.600 --> 20:45.196
When you were still with Pete,
did you ever get off with anyone else?

20:45.280 --> 20:47.271
No. Never had the chance.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.999
A couple of times with Adam,
but it doesn't count, does it?

20:50.080 --> 20:52.833
I was pretty bloody well-behaved, actually.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.876
Mind you, not for want of trying.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.469
You can't! All right, then, go on, prove it.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.358
Dare me.
- All right, then, I dare you.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.273
<i>Let's hope he doesn't do
bloody Danny Boy again.</i>

21:11.320 --> 21:15.154
Well, this must be the great crack
that everyone talks about.

21:16.560 --> 21:21.554
Right. Oh. Right, now, I know this is
going to piss a lot of you off,

21:21.640 --> 21:23.676
but one singer, one song.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.230
It's my stag night, and that's just tough,
I'm afraid.

21:29.760 --> 21:33.753
This is a very beautiful, very old,
traditional Irish folk song.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.353
Told you. Danny Boy.

21:35.440 --> 21:39.115
I'd just like to dedicate it
to any old girlfriends out there

21:39.200 --> 21:42.829
with my sincere and heartfelt apologies.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.677
# You see a pair of laughin' eyes

21:48.440 --> 21:51.637
# And suddenly you're sighing sighs

21:52.320 --> 21:56.871
# You're thinking nothing's wrong,
you string along, boy, then snap!

21:59.760 --> 22:04.880
# Those eyes, those sighs,
they're part of the tender trap

22:07.240 --> 22:10.869
# You're hand in hand beneath the trees

22:10.960 --> 22:14.555
# And soon there's music in the breeze

22:14.640 --> 22:19.953
# You're acting kinda smart
until your heart just goes whap!

22:23.040 --> 22:27.431
# Those trees, that breeze,
they're part of the tender trap

22:27.520 --> 22:31.229
Rach, can you come out, love?
- I'll come out in a minute!

22:31.320 --> 22:34.232
I told you this would happen.
- She chose bloody truth.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.357
Yeah, but did you have to be
quite so truthful?

22:37.440 --> 22:39.874
What?

22:39.960 --> 22:42.554
Did you have sex with him?
- Oh, my God, no!

22:42.640 --> 22:44.039
So, what did happen, then?

22:44.120 --> 22:47.430
What do you mean? Like what base
did he get to? Not even first.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.272
So you didn't kiss?

22:49.360 --> 22:50.475
No, not really.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.073
No?
- No.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.116
Truth, Jen.
- All right, yeah.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.555
So you did get to first base!

22:56.640 --> 23:00.189
# Some starry night

23:00.280 --> 23:03.989
# When her kisses make you tingle

23:04.080 --> 23:07.550
# She'll hoId you tight

23:07.640 --> 23:13.033
# And you'll hate yourself for being single

23:13.120 --> 23:15.031
Have you ever got off with Adam?

23:15.120 --> 23:17.759
Don't be ridiculous! I'm a married woman.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.833
So is she, but it didn't matter to her.
- Bloody hell, who's she? The cat's mother?

23:21.920 --> 23:25.629
I dare say you knew what was
going on, though. Truth, Karen!

23:28.680 --> 23:30.318
I may have had an idea, yeah.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.077
Fan-bloody-tastic!

23:34.080 --> 23:36.753
Rachel Bradley - figure of fun!

23:36.840 --> 23:41.311
# And then you wonder how it all came about

23:41.400 --> 23:45.029
# It's too late now, there's no getting out

23:45.120 --> 23:51.912
# You fell in love, and lo-o-ove is
the tender trap

24:03.480 --> 24:06.313
Maybe we should burst in and overpower her.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.478
What for?
- She might do herself a mischief.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.198
What, with a sewing kit?

24:12.280 --> 24:14.236
Have you got any better ideas?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.675
I'm not gonna do myself a mischief.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.433
Rachel, where are you going?
- I'm going swimming.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.795
Oh, God! Now she's going to drown herself.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.639
Wait, we'll get our costumes.
- I'd like to be on my own.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.951
So I suppose I'm not maid of honour, then?
- No, you are certainly not!

24:29.040 --> 24:32.794
Do you not think you're over-reacting a bit?
- Jenny! You got off with the groom!

24:33.880 --> 24:36.633
Yes...but not recently.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.754
Anyway, there isn't going to be a wedding!

24:42.040 --> 24:45.669
So, are you married, Roy?
- Widowed, two years ago.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.309
I'm so sorry.
- Ah, it's not your fault.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.392
Now, the famine, on the other hand,
that was your fault.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.239
Eh, get on.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.709
<i>How long were you married?
- 24 years.</i>

25:00.800 --> 25:03.837
<i>24 years. Blimey, that's a long time.</i>

25:03.920 --> 25:06.992
I only managed seven. I cocked it all up.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.355
I wonder how long Karen and I have got.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.590
You two, you'll be all right.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.432
You think so?
- Yeah.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.954
You and Karen, you're like sharks.

25:16.040 --> 25:19.715
Like sharks?
- You know what they say about sharks.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.950
They mate for life.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.998
Actually, I think you'll find
it's swans that mate for life.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.392
What do sharks do, then?
- Sharks sleep around.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.400
Excuse me.
- Eh, where are you off to?

25:33.480 --> 25:35.152
I've just got to phone Karen.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.550
Hi. It's me. Did I wake you?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.552
I'm sorry. It's just...

25:52.720 --> 25:54.153
We really need to talk.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.949
You know, you are the last person
I expected to see here.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.951
And why is that?

26:00.040 --> 26:02.315
I don't know. You were always so ambitious.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.995
I know, but my mum got sick
and what could I do?

26:07.320 --> 26:11.552
Anyway, I wanted to be a singer-songwriter,
for Christ's sake!

26:11.640 --> 26:13.790
Are you really so surprised it
didn't work out?

26:13.880 --> 26:17.077
I thought you'd be married,
have a couple of kids, maybe.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.230
I was married.
- Oh, yeah.

26:19.320 --> 26:23.438
Anyway, Mr Big City Systems Analyst,
I'm quite happy here, you know.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.593
We've got running water, electric light,
and the magic box with people talking on it.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.238
Yeah, yeah, you made your point.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.996
Just because we haven't got Habitat
and Pizza Express, we do still pull through.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.035
I'd completely forgotten how
scary you can be.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.036
Well, don't.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.957
Do you want to go for a walk?
- Do you think that'd be a good idea?

26:50.040 --> 26:52.190
# Danny Boy

26:55.640 --> 26:57.870
Oh, Jesus, sounds like a great idea.
Come on!

26:57.960 --> 27:01.873
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

27:05.520 --> 27:12.710
# Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes
are calling

27:12.800 --> 27:20.036
# From glen to glen,
and down the mountain side

27:20.120 --> 27:22.680
# The summer's gone

27:22.760 --> 27:26.230
# And all the roses falling

27:27.280 --> 27:32.798
# 'Tis you, 'tis you must go,
and I must bide...

27:32.880 --> 27:33.869
Hello.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.080
I can't hear you. What did you say?

27:39.840 --> 27:41.796
Karen?

27:41.880 --> 27:44.440
Oh... Er... Er... Hang on.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.598
Blimey, how'd you do that?

27:54.960 --> 27:56.916
Talk on two phones at once.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.953
Well, yeah. I thought you were
talking to David.

28:07.240 --> 28:10.550
Yeah, yeah. Just hang on a second,
I'll just go and get him.

28:12.720 --> 28:16.952
That is not true, Jessica.
That is absolutely not true.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.239
I'm talking to Karen.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.477
This is Karen.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.112
I'lll call you back.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.318
Hello, darling, how are you?

28:42.880 --> 28:44.711
No, he's in the pub.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.358
I'll go and get him.

28:54.040 --> 28:59.239
Look, you can't cancel the wedding
over a silly thing like this.

29:00.880 --> 29:01.949
Eh?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.351
I've bought a hat.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.309
Look, all right. Oh, God, I'm sorry.

29:18.400 --> 29:22.632
Rach, all right, I am a prat.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.757
But would you please come out
and we can talk about it?

29:25.840 --> 29:27.990
Leave me alone, Jen.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.709
You can't stay in there, love.
You'll catch your death.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.991
Maybe it's for the best.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.150
Oh, sod it!

29:38.400 --> 29:41.710
I bloody hope you can do mouth-to-mouth.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.794
Cor!

29:49.880 --> 29:51.677
Oh, my God!

29:51.760 --> 29:54.991
I thought they said it was heated
in the brochure.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.150
You get used to it after a while.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.551
Hiya.
- Hi.

30:01.640 --> 30:05.394
You're not going to splash me, are you?
- No.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.234
It didn't mean anything, Rach, I promise.

30:09.320 --> 30:13.108
Not to Adam. If I'm absolutely honest...

30:14.440 --> 30:17.034
..I wish that it had, but it didn't.
I promise.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.271
I think it just got us at a bad time,
you know.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.874
All that stuff with me and Pete.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.871
You'd just left him, and...

30:27.560 --> 30:30.199
You're not going to cancel the wedding,
are you?

30:32.560 --> 30:34.516
I don't know.

30:34.600 --> 30:40.470
It's just, I thought I knew everything,
you know? And now this comes up.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.869
Having fun, you two?

30:44.120 --> 30:45.951
Yes, thanks.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.110
Fancy a dip?

30:48.200 --> 30:50.077
No, thanks.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.757
Listen, you're going to think I'm mad,
and we may live to regret this,

30:54.840 --> 30:57.957
but there's a flight to Belfast in
three hours' time.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.439
Hiya.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.399
Cor, you're lucky, mate! If we'd found you
a few hours ago you'd have been in trouble.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.993
We'd like to check out, please.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.594
Yeah, It's been lovely, though.
Thanks very much.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.398
Yes. It's been very, very relaxing.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.710
You two thinking of a family yet?
- No.

31:17.800 --> 31:22.794
No, er...we're going to wait a while,
give it a couple of years.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.438
Good idea.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.516
You'll make a great dad, though.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.275
Do you think?
- Oh, yeah. You're just the type.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.999
Kids are more on your level,
intellectually speaking.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.631
Actually, I...I don't think we can
have children.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.711
What? You can't?

31:43.160 --> 31:46.038
No. There's a...there's a medical problem.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.910
Right. Well, that was a smart thing to say.
Nice one, Jane.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.228
Don't worry about it.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.949
I'm so sorry, Adam. I had no idea.
- Don't be daft. You weren't to know.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.516
We've talked about it, and we're fine,
you know.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.832
No, really, we're fine.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.996
Solid as a rock.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.072
Come on.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.836
You must be mad!
You must be stark raving mad!

32:19.920 --> 32:21.148
I know, I know.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.196
What were you thinking of?

32:24.560 --> 32:26.516
It was a crush.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.436
It was exciting. I was flattered.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.949
I'm not that used to people finding me
attractive. You know how it is.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.996
Eh? What?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.036
Oh, cheers. Thanks a lot!

32:39.120 --> 32:43.398
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I just meant...
You know, I lost my head, that's all.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.712
Oh, right, yeah. You were out of control.
It was all an accident!

32:48.800 --> 32:50.677
No, I didn't mean that neither.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.389
I don't know what you're on about.
You did exactly the same thing.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.471
Yeah, I know I did. And look at me now!

32:56.560 --> 32:59.154
And if Karen finds out, which she will,

32:59.240 --> 33:03.074
you might as well come and join me
in bachelor bedsit land.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.549
See your kids on Sundays, that kind
of thing!

33:05.640 --> 33:07.358
It's almost as if you're enjoying this.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.034
Don't be stupid! Don't be so bloody stupid!

33:10.120 --> 33:12.793
I'm your mate, aren't I?

33:14.880 --> 33:17.269
So, are you going to get that, or am I?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.516
Hello. Oh, hi.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.636
No, we've checked the hotel. Still no sign.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.154
He's probably out with mates.
He'll be back in a sec.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.196
Can you tell me what's going on?

33:33.560 --> 33:35.516
OK. Great.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.158
Yeah, call me.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.833
That was Karen.
- Which one?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.757
They're catching the next flight.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.958
Roy! Hey, what are you doing here?

33:48.040 --> 33:52.909
All right there, fellas. I got locked out of my hotel,
so I thought I'd go for a walk.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.639
You haven't seen Adam, have you?
- Ah, the happy groom.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.314
We've got to find him first.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.551
You need a hand looking for him?
- That would be fantastic.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.835
Need a little something to warm
you up a bit?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.956
Ooh, yeah.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.632
Cheers, Roy.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.114
Adam!

34:27.199 --> 34:31.398
God, you were so full of yourself,
working at that bingo hall.

34:31.480 --> 34:35.438
Always a smile for the old ladies.
The king of Portrush.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.158
You were the same.

34:37.239 --> 34:42.632
There can't have been a teenage boy in
the whole county that wasn't mooning after you.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.109
I mooned at you, I think!

34:45.199 --> 34:49.591
I remember great hordes of them
trotting after you with their tongues hanging out.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.272
Probably still are.

34:51.360 --> 34:55.638
Hardly. How old do you have to be
before you officially become a spinster?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.392
Oh, come on.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.789
Oh, you're right, I have my moments.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.632
Only nothing like us, though.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.359
I mean, I probably shouldn't be
saying this, but...

35:04.440 --> 35:08.877
when I was waiting for the wedding,
I had this idea that you'd turn up.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.918
I mean, I loved Billy,
and I still would have married him.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.754
I just thought that if you turned up
it might make things a bit more...

35:15.840 --> 35:17.796
interesting.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.836
You're better off without me, believe me.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.876
Oh, I'm sure I am.

35:27.680 --> 35:31.355
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm
frozen. It's late, or early or...

35:36.840 --> 35:39.115
I haven't seen that look in a long while.
- What?

35:39.200 --> 35:42.397
That meaningful, cow-eyed, horny look
you get.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.274
I just wanted to put something to you.
- What's that?

35:48.480 --> 35:49.993
I don't know. I just really...

35:52.280 --> 35:53.679
I really wanted to kiss you.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.150
Well, you can't.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.117
That's what getting married means.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.794
Isn't there supposed to be a tradition?

36:04.840 --> 36:07.798
Oh, it's your stag night
so you can get off with anyone you like?

36:07.880 --> 36:10.599
That's positively medieval, Adam Williams.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.872
So I can't kiss you, then?

36:17.240 --> 36:21.313
No. I will not be the last meal
of the condemned man.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.950
Not even a peck?

36:28.120 --> 36:29.553
No way.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.716
That's a shame.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.552
Isn't it?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.396
Right, that's your lot.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.316
That was definitely a kiss goodbye.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.711
Maybe next lifetime, eh?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.438
OK.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.989
Next lifetime.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.269
# Danny boy

37:16.320 --> 37:20.632
# Oh, Danny boy

37:21.560 --> 37:32.312
# I love you so-o-o

37:32.400 --> 37:34.755
Ah, beautiful.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.990
Great crack, great crack.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.111
You're crying.
- I'm not.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.634
You're crying, you big poof!

37:42.720 --> 37:45.075
Hey, who fancies another Irish song?

37:45.160 --> 37:48.038
How about The Skye Boat Song?
- That's not Irish.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.473
Near enough.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.913
No, trust me, it isn't.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.150
It's all, you know, Celtic.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.878
Adam!

37:54.960 --> 37:58.316
Adam, where are you?

37:58.400 --> 38:01.756
Oh, my head hurts. Shouldn't we just give up
and go back to the hotel?

38:01.840 --> 38:05.753
Hey! Hey! Adam is my best mate, right?

38:05.840 --> 38:07.558
And best mates stick together.

38:07.640 --> 38:11.349
I'm going to track him down, no matter
what it takes, and save his marriage,

38:11.440 --> 38:14.716
if it's the last thing I do on
this earth! Right?

38:30.840 --> 38:32.273
Oh, no.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.472
Oh, God, no.

38:36.680 --> 38:40.639
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.109
Had a good night, then, did you?
- Rachel.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.838
Hello.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.592
This is a surprise.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.157
Now, I know this looks bad...

38:52.280 --> 38:55.431
Rachel, there's an innocent
explanation. Rachel!

38:55.520 --> 38:56.509
No!

38:57.800 --> 38:59.631
Morning. Bad dream?

39:01.400 --> 39:02.833
Nightmare.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.751
How are you feeling?

39:05.800 --> 39:07.153
Like I'm dead.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.674
Well, you're not. I can smell your breath.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.117
Jane, did...?
- What?

39:17.240 --> 39:19.196
Last night, did we make love?

39:20.880 --> 39:22.677
Oh, God, yes.
- We did?

39:22.760 --> 39:26.469
Oh, yes, we made love long and hard.
You were like a steam train.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.278
So we dldn't, then?
- No, we didn't.

39:28.360 --> 39:32.911
We came back here,
emptied that...and you fell asleep.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.077
Oh, thank God for that.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.594
And a merry Christmas to you, too.

39:39.680 --> 39:43.195
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I meant I'm glad.

39:43.280 --> 39:47.273
Glad that we didn't do something
that you'd regret? Just piss off, Adam!

39:48.840 --> 39:50.796
Are you angry with me?

39:50.880 --> 39:52.438
Would it matter?
- Yes.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.636
Well, I'm not.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.078
Oh, Jane, I had a good time.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.556
So did I.

40:02.640 --> 40:06.792
And nothing happened.
Nothing you need worry about.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.392
So, I'll see you, then.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.913
See you.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.549
If you've got a pen, I'll give you
my number. - No, that's all right.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.279
You don't want my number?
- No, I don't think so.

40:21.360 --> 40:26.275
What for? ''Hello, Rachel. Adam's first
love here. Could I have a word?''

40:26.360 --> 40:27.952
You could be friends with Rachel.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.838
No offence, Adam, but I don't
think I want to.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.478
But as friends.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.596
I have enough friends. I don't need
any more.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.070
But if she jilts you at the altar,
you can look me up. Otherwise...

40:41.160 --> 40:43.594
Let's just get on with our lives, yeah?

40:45.200 --> 40:46.758
So, when will I see you again?

40:51.840 --> 40:52.989
Bye, then.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.549
Bye.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.638
Next lifetime, eh?

41:02.280 --> 41:03.838
It's a date.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.198
You know I'll never forget you.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.599
You bloody well better not!

41:52.080 --> 41:53.593
Karen!

41:53.680 --> 41:57.992
So, David.
Is there anything you want to tell me?

42:05.800 --> 42:07.631
Boo!
- Surprise!

42:09.440 --> 42:12.716
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Keep calm.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.757
Didn't expect to see us, did you?
- No!

42:17.840 --> 42:21.230
Is this a bad time? - No, no, you're
timing's absolutely perfect!

42:21.320 --> 42:23.515
Hi, Rach.
- Hello.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.433
Everything all right? Are you well?
What's gone wrong?

42:26.520 --> 42:28.112
Nothing's gone wrong.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.839
Morning, Pete, David.
- All right?

42:30.920 --> 42:32.512
Quite a night, eh?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.670
Oh, what a night.
- All right, Roy?

42:34.760 --> 42:38.036
How are you, you old rascal?
- Rascal!

42:39.720 --> 42:41.870
Do you fancy a walk?
- Yeah.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.757
What am I going to do?

42:46.560 --> 42:49.552
Anyway, I woke up, found myself
on Tony's sofa

42:49.640 --> 42:53.838
with this post-apocalyptic hangover,
like, you know, and here we are.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.592
Right, I see.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.274
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

42:58.360 --> 43:00.191
No, no, no, I don't think so. Why?

43:01.440 --> 43:03.078
Adam, I know everything.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.116
You do?
- Uh-huh.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.399
Who told you?

43:08.480 --> 43:11.756
Oh, yeah, like I can't guess! Thanks
a lot, Pete! - No. She told me.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.195
How?

43:14.280 --> 43:19.149
How? I don't know. I think she just wanted
to get it off her chest and it slipped out.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.708
I don't understand. You don't even know her.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.360
What are you talking about?
Of course I know her.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.351
At least I thought I did until yesterday.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.510
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on! Wait!

43:29.480 --> 43:32.711
You're telling me that Jane told you
about what happened between us?

43:32.800 --> 43:34.631
Yes. Jen told me everything.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.676
Last night when we got drunk.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.829
I'm not angry with her.
And I'm not angry with you.

43:40.920 --> 43:45.357
Except I am angry with you. Bloody angry!
We were going to be honest with each other.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.510
We are! If it was important, I would
have said.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.751
Adam, one of our best friends
says she's in love with you,

43:50.840 --> 43:53.400
and you don't think it's important?

43:53.480 --> 43:56.916
Rach, it was a crush. A silly crush.
Jen was low and I was down because...

43:58.000 --> 44:00.275
Well, you know why I was down.

44:00.360 --> 44:04.035
And there was the matter of your first
husband. - Which I told you about.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.076
Yeah, eventually.
- God, I hate this.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.435
What?
- Feeling like some bloody policeman!

44:08.520 --> 44:11.432
Feeling like I've got to check up on you
the whole time.

44:11.520 --> 44:15.593
Finding out what
everybody else knows apart from me.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.711
I just want to feel safe, Adam.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.073
You know, a bit looked-after.
That's why people get married, isn't it?

44:24.160 --> 44:26.116
Of course.

44:27.480 --> 44:31.598
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
- Nothing.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.194
You swear?
- I swear.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.239
Rachel...

44:40.120 --> 44:44.159
I love you more than anyone
and anything in this world.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.952
And that's why I want to marry you.

45:01.360 --> 45:05.751
Young love. It really is a beautiful
thing, isn't it?

45:05.840 --> 45:07.796
Yeah.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.596
Sorry, are you being sarcastic?

45:14.400 --> 45:15.628
Maybe.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.676
I'm not sure.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.712
Come on, then. Fess up!

45:21.960 --> 45:23.598
What did you get up to last night?

45:29.080 --> 45:30.957
Well...

45:31.040 --> 45:32.996
Actually, I don't want to know.

45:36.240 --> 45:40.472
I'm sure you boys are entitled to
a few sordid little secrets.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.958
As long as it's not too awful.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.596
No.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.238
Don't worry.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.316
Nothing too awful.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.869
What's that word?
- What word?

45:59.960 --> 46:03.475
Old English word,
begins with a C, describes me.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.556
You dare!
- Cuddly.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.959
No, that's not it.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.997
I've got it. Cuckold!
- Cuckold?

46:13.080 --> 46:17.676
Everyone knows about you and me and Adam,
and here's Pete, the cuckold, looking like a prat.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.716
Come on, Pete.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.310
The past is the least of our worries,
I reckon.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.829
Do you think they're going to be
all right, then?

46:28.920 --> 46:30.876
Adam and Rach?

46:30.960 --> 46:32.916
Yeah, they'll be fine.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.956
People said that about us!

46:35.040 --> 46:36.996
We are fine.

46:37.080 --> 46:39.833
We're not together, but we're OK.

46:44.560 --> 46:46.516
I do miss you, though.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.156
I miss you, too.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.352
You know that.
- Yeah, I suppose so.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.032
Hiya.
- Hi.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.270
They are sweet.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.913
I take it this means the coast's
clear, then?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.956
We're fine.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.560
Hi.
- Hi.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.950
Obviously, I'm very sorry.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.871
Yeah, obviously.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.632
Don't be daft.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.632
So, what are we going to do now?
- Dunno.

47:23.720 --> 47:27.872
# People running don't have much to say

47:29.200 --> 47:33.512
# You'd better catch your dreams
before they fade away

47:35.560 --> 47:39.394
# We're all here until we know not when

47:41.360 --> 47:45.194
# Love has gone and won't come back again

47:46.920 --> 47:49.309
# I'm gonna take it

47:50.280 --> 47:52.191
# Break it

47:53.360 --> 47:56.955
# Make it if you can

47:58.200 --> 48:00.668
# I will show you

48:01.720 --> 48:03.551
# Oh, you

48:04.480 --> 48:06.596
# You know we'll be together

48:06.680 --> 48:11.470
# If we try

48:12.305 --> 48:18.420
