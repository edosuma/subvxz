00:04.260 --> 00:07.510
- What are you doing?
- Shush. Shush.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.554
One of the smoke alarms is chirping.

00:09.641 --> 00:12.676
I'm trying to figure out which one it is
so I can change the battery.

00:12.769 --> 00:16.767
- Well, if anybody can find it...
- it's you.

00:16.857 --> 00:19.395
You sound horrible.

00:19.484 --> 00:21.726
Why don't, uh...
Why don't you go back to bed?

00:21.820 --> 00:23.481
'Cause I've got too much to do.

00:23.573 --> 00:25.365
I've gotta make the ladyfingers
for the bake sale...

00:25.449 --> 00:27.110
and I've gotta go by the gym.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.360
- I left my phone there yesterday.
- I'll do all of that.

00:29.454 --> 00:32.870
We're a team. When one of us is weak,
we lean on the other.

00:32.959 --> 00:34.500
Honey, you don't have to do that stuff.

00:34.585 --> 00:36.543
Honey, with all you do for me...

00:36.629 --> 00:40.378
including going to the gym
four times a week to keep me interested...

00:40.467 --> 00:42.044
I got this.

00:42.136 --> 00:43.962
Don't you have houses to show today?

00:44.053 --> 00:45.548
They... canceled.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.134
Oh, pumpkin.

00:47.224 --> 00:49.217
Are you kidding me? It's lucky.

00:49.309 --> 00:51.350
This way I get to stay here
and take care of you.

00:51.437 --> 00:53.846
Okay.

00:55.651 --> 00:59.150
- Hey.
- Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Dunphy. Is Haley ready for school?

00:59.238 --> 01:01.729
She's on her way down.
Don't get too close to my wife.

01:01.823 --> 01:04.316
Haley told you about that?
It was just a dream.

01:04.411 --> 01:05.573
Oh, God.

01:07.121 --> 01:09.827
- Okay, that came from the kitchen.
- I thought it was in here.

01:09.917 --> 01:12.455
Really? Okay, you wait in here
and listen for it.

01:12.544 --> 01:14.039
I'm gonna wait in there.

01:14.129 --> 01:17.546
I mean, it's the least I can do after...
Well, you know.

01:17.633 --> 01:19.756
I'm coming with you.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.101
Boy, I wish Haley
would date some other boys.

01:26.184 --> 01:28.593
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?

01:28.688 --> 01:30.231
Don't.

01:30.315 --> 01:33.019
I just feel like she owes it
to herself to see what else is out there.

01:33.109 --> 01:35.102
The way that Dylan's
always hanging around here...

01:35.194 --> 01:38.446
he's probably going to try
to marry her the second she turns 18.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.783
Hey, you never know. Maybe those two
are meant to be together...

01:41.870 --> 01:43.280
Like we were.

01:43.371 --> 01:46.041
Honey, Haley and Dylan are not us.

01:48.294 --> 01:50.499
No, I think that amount will be fine.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.078
I'm just happy you want Lily.

01:58.263 --> 02:00.136
Cam, did you just sell our baby?

02:00.223 --> 02:03.427
No, but do you remember that agent
we met that represents child actors...

02:03.518 --> 02:06.473
the one who said Lily might have what it
takes and gave us his card?

02:06.563 --> 02:09.731
- That I threw away.
- That I fished out of the trash.

02:09.818 --> 02:12.736
That was him on the phone.

02:12.820 --> 02:15.609
They're shooting a children's furniture
store commercial today...

02:15.699 --> 02:17.323
and they want Lily.

02:17.409 --> 02:18.986
Look, I threw away that card for a reason.

02:19.078 --> 02:22.494
Come on. It'll be fun.
And Lily'll be on TV.

02:22.581 --> 02:24.870
And we can put the money
in her college account.

02:24.959 --> 02:27.997
No. Let's just let our daughter
have a normal childhood, huh?

02:28.087 --> 02:31.090
I think that gay cruise has sailed.

02:31.175 --> 02:32.834
It's just one commercial.

02:32.927 --> 02:36.178
I don't like it. No. No.

02:36.264 --> 02:37.888
Oh, what? So that's it?

02:37.974 --> 02:40.264
You're the parent with final say?
Why is that?

02:40.352 --> 02:42.973
- Because you make the money?
- It's not about that, and you know it.

02:43.064 --> 02:46.018
I wouldn't expect you to understand us.
You're not theater folk.

02:46.108 --> 02:48.730
And neither are you.
You did <i>Godspell</i> one summer in a barn.

02:48.819 --> 02:50.362
You're barn folk.

02:50.446 --> 02:52.355
Get used to that jealousy, Lily.

02:52.449 --> 02:54.524
Ordinary people just don't understand us.

02:56.203 --> 02:58.491
<i>Dennis to Shipping and Receiving.</i>

02:58.581 --> 03:00.040
<i>Hola,</i> Jack.

03:00.123 --> 03:01.867
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

03:01.959 --> 03:05.329
Manny had a doctor's appointment
so we're gonna catch lunch with Jay.

03:05.422 --> 03:07.296
- Is he there?
- Yeah, he's in back.

03:07.383 --> 03:09.671
- Good day, Jackson.
- Good day, Manuel.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.630
- I see you're still forklifting.
- More like lifting the fork.

03:12.722 --> 03:14.715
Man. I was gonna say that joke.

03:14.808 --> 03:18.223
I'm sorry, but I gotta
have lunch with my wife today.

03:18.311 --> 03:21.562
I know, baby, but I had to marry her
so she could stay in the country.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.108
Oh, no.

03:23.192 --> 03:26.396
Where am I gonna find another husband
that wears sweatpants to work?

03:26.487 --> 03:29.986
- Resort wear.
- Mm-hmm. Maybe last resort.

03:30.074 --> 03:32.151
I'm glad you guys stopped by for lunch,
'cause you know what?

03:32.244 --> 03:34.652
- I gotta work a little late tonight.
- Oh, not tonight.

03:34.746 --> 03:36.656
Did you forget our date?

03:36.749 --> 03:39.074
No. No. I was kidding.

03:39.167 --> 03:41.041
I had no idea what she was talking about.

03:41.128 --> 03:42.587
Gloria, God love her...

03:42.672 --> 03:46.422
likes to celebrate every possible
milestone in our relationship...

03:46.510 --> 03:48.005
the day we met...

03:48.094 --> 03:52.306
our first date... which I forgot,
so we got in a big fight.

03:52.392 --> 03:54.467
Now we commemorate the big fight.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.387
I thought we could recreate the date.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.559
Do everything that we did the first time.
So romantic.

04:00.651 --> 04:03.735
You know, that's exactly what I was thinking.

04:03.821 --> 04:06.276
<i>Ay,</i> Jack is so nice.

04:06.366 --> 04:08.025
I think he really likes Manny.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.826
What he likes is getting out of work.

04:11.204 --> 04:13.530
- Wait a minute... Is that Manny driving?
- Is it?

04:17.878 --> 04:19.539
Yeah, that's him.

04:21.173 --> 04:23.251

04:32.979 --> 04:35.220
<i>Ay,</i> my poor <i>papi...</i>

04:35.315 --> 04:38.102
- Two doctors in one day.
- Mom, I'm fine.

04:38.193 --> 04:39.984
The hospital said
I could go back to school.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.941
No. You suffered a traumatic experience.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.656
I barely remember it.

04:44.741 --> 04:46.403
I remember crashing through the wall...

04:46.493 --> 04:47.988
and the ambulance ride to the hospital.

04:48.078 --> 04:49.573
That wasn't an ambulance. I drove you.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.573
- Then what was that siren?
- That was your mother.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.752
- I was not that loud.
- Cars pulled over, honey.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.754
- Jay, I'm sorry about your wall.
- Wasn't your fault.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.963
It was Jack's,
and I've already taken care of him.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.172
- You kill him?
- Can't kill people here. I fired him.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.836
But it was just an accident.
He didn't mean it.

05:05.932 --> 05:08.140
Guy's a screw-up.
Should've been gone months ago.

05:08.227 --> 05:10.682
- Can't we just give him another chance?
- What is this "we"?

05:10.771 --> 05:12.432
Let me explain something to you people.

05:12.524 --> 05:15.310
Here in this family, it's "we."
At work, it's "me."

05:15.402 --> 05:18.521
My rules, my decisions. Period.

05:18.614 --> 05:20.321
That's not fair.

05:22.951 --> 05:25.442
- You mad at me too?
- No. You're right.

05:25.537 --> 05:27.530
It's your work.

05:27.623 --> 05:31.872
Besides, I can't be mad at you,
not on our special day.

05:32.587 --> 05:34.212
Honey, I was thinking.

05:34.298 --> 05:35.841
With what happened to Manny...

05:35.924 --> 05:39.626
maybe we'd better postpone
our special day until next weekend.

05:39.721 --> 05:42.212
No, next weekend is the anniversary...

05:42.306 --> 05:44.133
of the first time that I cooked for you.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.972
<i>Jesse, I'm sorry.</i>

05:50.066 --> 05:51.857
How you doin', Typhoid Clairey?

05:51.942 --> 05:54.101
Hey, what are you doing home?

05:54.196 --> 05:56.023
She caught your cold
and had to come home.

05:56.114 --> 05:59.199
I thought we should contain you two and
keep it from spreading through the house.

05:59.285 --> 06:01.242
Come here. I'm so sorry.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.988
- It's okay.
- Ohh.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.654
- Hey, did you finish my ladyfingers?
- Not yet.

06:05.749 --> 06:07.826
- Did you pick up my phone?
- Not yet. -

06:07.918 --> 06:09.911
Is that the smoke detector?
I thought you fixed that.

06:10.004 --> 06:13.208
- Boy, you're really starting to
sound like your old self. - Ugh.

06:17.013 --> 06:18.923
- You know what this reminds me of?
- Huh?

06:19.015 --> 06:22.349
When you were little and we used to
snuggle and watch soap operas together.

06:22.435 --> 06:24.095
Remember that? Nothing's changed.

06:24.188 --> 06:26.513
Sonya's still married to that guy with the...

06:26.606 --> 06:28.683
- Wait a second.
- Bad hairline.

06:28.775 --> 06:30.271
- Dylan?
- Okay.

06:30.361 --> 06:32.733
God, I miss you too.

06:33.906 --> 06:36.029
Oh, it's just a cold, silly.

06:36.118 --> 06:38.526
You don't have to conceive
of a world without me.

06:40.247 --> 06:43.415
Oh, nothing.
I'm just in bed with my mom.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.418
Stop freaking out. It is not coming true.

06:54.388 --> 06:57.140
Uh, Mrs. Vaughn, it's Phil Dunphy.
It's about 3:30.

06:57.225 --> 06:59.052
Uh, now, I know you said
you'd moved on...

06:59.143 --> 07:01.895
but, um, there's been
a significant price reduction...

07:01.980 --> 07:05.515
in the, uh, house in Sullivan Canyon,
which I know you loved.

07:05.609 --> 07:08.361
So, uh, if there's any chance
you might reconsider...

07:08.446 --> 07:10.273
I know you will not be sorry.

07:10.365 --> 07:12.523
I can meet you any time,
so just give me a call.

07:12.617 --> 07:15.239
Any... Any time. I can meet you wherever...

07:15.329 --> 07:18.116
- - that place
is that you feel would be best.

07:18.207 --> 07:20.330
Okay, thank you. Bye.

07:20.418 --> 07:22.991
- Dad?
- Hey, buddy.

07:23.088 --> 07:24.497
How are you? What are you doing?

07:24.589 --> 07:26.296
Keeping the germs off me.

07:26.382 --> 07:29.468
You care about germs?
I've seen you kiss a pigeon on the mouth.

07:29.553 --> 07:31.842
My class is going
to Disneyland in two days.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.473
I can't get Mom's cold.

07:33.557 --> 07:35.266
Oh. Good plan.

07:35.351 --> 07:38.685
I remember this. My dad bought it during
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

07:38.771 --> 07:41.606
- I never got a turn in that. You think later I could...
- Yeah, maybe.

07:41.691 --> 07:43.316
What are you doing home
in the afternoon?

07:43.401 --> 07:47.151
Oh, no big deal. I just had a couple
of showings fall through.

07:47.239 --> 07:49.814
- Again?
- You know what I always say.

07:49.908 --> 07:53.030
Sure do. "Can't get back on that horse
unless you fall off."

07:53.121 --> 07:55.446
- That's right.
- Ow. That's loud.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.703
Sorry.

07:56.792 --> 07:59.710
Where is that coming from?

07:59.796 --> 08:03.378
Changing the battery in a smoke detector
is what they teach you in Man 101...

08:03.465 --> 08:06.218
so, of course, every time
I hear that noise, all I hear is...

08:06.303 --> 08:08.544
"Beep, beep. You're not a man.
Beep, beep. You're not"...

08:08.639 --> 08:10.465
Really?

08:11.558 --> 08:13.931
Hey, Dad, can you open this for me?

08:14.019 --> 08:15.679
Oh, sure, buddy.

08:17.858 --> 08:19.351
Ow. Mmm.

08:19.442 --> 08:21.565
- What happened?
- Broke a nail.

08:24.365 --> 08:26.072
- Mitchell, what's up?
- What do you mean?

08:26.158 --> 08:28.365
You just sent me an urgent text
saying to come right over.

08:28.453 --> 08:31.204
That was from me. I used Jay's phone.

08:31.288 --> 08:32.746
Oh, what happened to your face?

08:32.832 --> 08:34.575
Oh, just a little scrape-up.

08:34.668 --> 08:36.957
Mitchell, I'd like
to engage your legal services...

08:37.044 --> 08:40.331
in representing my friend Jack
in a wrongful termination suit.

08:40.424 --> 08:42.003
Forget it. He's not coming back.

08:42.092 --> 08:43.422
Don't take the case, Mitchell.

08:43.511 --> 08:46.217
I don't think I was gonna take the case.

08:46.305 --> 08:50.932
Fine. Then under the circumstances,
we have nothing further to talk about.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.095
These will be my last words to you.

08:53.188 --> 08:55.016
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

08:56.109 --> 08:57.768
Okay, you got me.

08:57.860 --> 09:01.064
I hope you feel clever tricking a kid.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.611
- Hello, Mitch.
- Hi, Gloria.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.445
My God. Congratulations.

09:05.535 --> 09:08.110
- Hmm? On what?
- Lily's commercial.

09:08.206 --> 09:10.328
- Oh no, no. We turned that down.
- Are you sure?

09:10.417 --> 09:13.169
Because Cam sent me a picture
of her in her makeup chair.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.170
- Sorry. He what?
- It's so exciting.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.673
You have to remember this day
so that you can celebrate it every year.

09:22.556 --> 09:24.881
Okay, folks,
we're about 10 minutes from shooting.

09:24.974 --> 09:27.299
- Is talent ready?
- Yes, she sure is.

09:27.394 --> 09:30.229
Did you hear that, Lily?
You're the talent.

09:30.313 --> 09:32.141
Isn't that magical?

09:32.232 --> 09:34.308
Ooh. Grapes.

09:34.402 --> 09:37.071
Mmm. And that is a prop.

09:37.155 --> 09:40.359
Okay, we really gotta hang up this time.
On the count of three.

09:40.450 --> 09:44.912
Ready? One, two, three.

09:46.291 --> 09:49.292
Hello? I can't believe he hung up.

09:49.377 --> 09:52.046
- I'm calling him back.
- Give me that.

09:54.341 --> 09:56.714
 <i>How the hell
did you get through that?</i>

09:56.802 --> 09:58.510
Oh, my God, is that Jesse?

09:58.595 --> 10:00.339
Mm-hmm. And he's still married to Angie.

10:01.849 --> 10:05.017
You know something else
you might find interesting...

10:05.102 --> 10:09.765
Sonya is drinking because she married
a buffoon when she was young...

10:09.859 --> 10:13.560
and now she realizes
she's wasted her entire life.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.326
Can you imagine
making a mistake like that?

10:17.409 --> 10:19.697
Yeah, that must be horrible.

10:19.787 --> 10:24.947
Yeah, now she's just a bitter ghost
of a woman filled with resentment.

10:25.042 --> 10:29.337
But that's what happens when you commit to
someone before you see what else is out there.

10:30.591 --> 10:32.963
Seriously?

10:33.052 --> 10:34.843
She couldn't have laid it on thicker.

10:34.929 --> 10:36.803
"Ghost of a woman"? "Total buffoon"?

10:36.888 --> 10:38.513
I'm not an idiot.

10:38.599 --> 10:40.723
She was talking about her and my dad.

10:40.809 --> 10:46.231
Yeah, well, maybe Sonya and her husband
just need to work a little harder.

10:46.316 --> 10:49.934
Can he give her those years back?

10:50.029 --> 10:52.401
She could have been something.

10:52.490 --> 10:56.738
She could have traveled the world,
been with fascinating men.

10:56.828 --> 10:59.118
She could have accomplished things.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.660
That's all she thinks about now...

11:01.751 --> 11:04.076
every time she looks at him.

11:11.929 --> 11:13.755
Ah! Ow.

11:14.765 --> 11:16.260
Is that Mom's apron?

11:18.227 --> 11:20.220
It's <i>an</i> apron. It's unisex.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.937
Some of the world's
greatest chefs are men.

11:22.022 --> 11:23.601
But it's bumped out where the boobs go.

11:23.691 --> 11:26.563
That's happening more and more.

11:26.654 --> 11:28.776
Hadn't noticed.

11:30.782 --> 11:33.868
Mrs. Vaughn. Thanks for calling back.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.945
Yeah, I was just about to, uh...

11:40.336 --> 11:43.289
I see. Is there anything
I can say that will...

11:43.380 --> 11:45.421
All right. Thank you very much, and if...

11:45.507 --> 11:47.632
Oh. Okay. Good-bye.

11:48.636 --> 11:50.464
Did you lose another one?

11:50.555 --> 11:53.592
Hey. Can't lose something
you never had, right, pal?

11:55.228 --> 11:57.054
- That was the doorbell, Dad.
- Yeah. I know.

11:58.732 --> 12:01.304
So what happens
if people stop buying houses?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.193
Are we all gonna have to get jobs?

12:03.278 --> 12:05.734
It's just a little slump, buddy.
Nothing I can't handle.

12:08.493 --> 12:10.367
Hi. I'm Ron.
I work out with Claire at the gym.

12:10.453 --> 12:11.994
Oh, yeah. Come on in.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.404
- I brought her phone back. She forgot it yesterday.
- Great. Thanks.

12:14.499 --> 12:16.160
- I'm Phil, Claire's husband.
- Oh.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.960
Uh, Claire never mentioned
she had a husband.

12:20.882 --> 12:22.340
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

12:22.425 --> 12:24.085
Oh, sorry! I burnt my ladyfingers.

12:33.396 --> 12:34.724
So quiet.

12:34.814 --> 12:37.139
It's like Christian Silence Reading Room.

12:37.232 --> 12:39.854
- I'm fine.
- So am I.

12:39.944 --> 12:42.566
Okay, my two stubborn <i>burros,</i>
I'm going out.

12:42.656 --> 12:44.447
Manny, be a good boy.

12:44.532 --> 12:47.203
Jay, I'll see you later.

12:47.285 --> 12:49.363
I think you know where.

12:49.455 --> 12:51.115
Honey?

12:51.206 --> 12:53.662
You know what I was just thinking?

12:53.752 --> 12:55.376
You know how when people are in love...

12:55.461 --> 12:57.372
sometimes they finish
each ether's sentences?

12:57.463 --> 12:59.671
Like, um...

12:59.758 --> 13:02.630
tonight we're going to...

13:02.720 --> 13:05.389
- Have fun.
- Yes.

13:05.473 --> 13:07.465
When we get to...

13:07.559 --> 13:09.469
Gether later.

13:14.692 --> 13:17.147
You have no idea
where you're going, do you?

13:17.236 --> 13:18.980
- Tell me.
- Hire Jack back.

13:19.071 --> 13:20.731
- Forget it.
- Your funeral.

13:22.284 --> 13:25.569
Okay, Lily, Daddy's going
to be right over here. Okay.

13:25.663 --> 13:27.739
Oh, and, um, by the way, if it helps...

13:27.831 --> 13:29.575
I have a list of things Lily can do.

13:29.666 --> 13:32.703
She can blow a kiss,
flap her arms like a bird...

13:32.795 --> 13:34.919
- Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
- Okay.

13:35.006 --> 13:38.209
- Cam. Cam.
- How did you get on the set?

13:38.302 --> 13:41.421
I walked on. It's not MGM.
It's a warehouse behind a mattress store.

13:41.513 --> 13:44.431
I can't believe you went
behind my back. We agreed...

13:44.516 --> 13:46.890
<i>We</i> didn't agree on anything.
<i>You</i> agreed.

13:46.978 --> 13:48.436
We don't have to agree on everything.

13:48.521 --> 13:50.313
I didn't like the book
you bought her last week...

13:50.399 --> 13:53.020
- but I didn't stop you from reading it to her.
- What was wrong with it?

13:53.109 --> 13:56.231
How was it a big day for Biscuit, Mitchell?
How?

13:56.322 --> 13:57.946
Okay, this isn't about Biscuit.

13:58.032 --> 13:59.526
I know. It's about our daughter, Lily.

13:59.617 --> 14:01.526
No, you want the truth?
I think it's about you, Cam.

14:01.620 --> 14:05.120
I think you're using our daughter to
fulfill some childhood dream of yours.

14:05.206 --> 14:08.576
Okay, parents,
we're ready to start rolling.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.578
Now, while we're doing the shoot...

14:10.671 --> 14:12.878
Jim and Deb here will do
the kids' voice-overs into the mic.

14:12.966 --> 14:14.461
Kinda like <i>Look Who's Talking.</i>

14:14.551 --> 14:16.461
Oh. That's right.

14:16.553 --> 14:19.127
There are a lot of important people here
so I'm not gonna get mad...

14:19.223 --> 14:21.797
but I resent the implication
that I would do anything...

14:21.892 --> 14:24.300
that's not in the best interest of our daughter.

14:24.395 --> 14:27.397
Okay, let's try a take. And... action.

14:27.483 --> 14:32.310
- Oh, no!
- We are lost in a city of high furniture prices.

14:32.405 --> 14:36.106
Oh! Can no one
protect us from these high prices?

14:36.201 --> 14:37.149
Cut.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.366
Lighting problem. One sec.

14:39.454 --> 14:41.364
You can apologize to me
any time you're ready.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.248
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

14:43.334 --> 14:45.326
This commercial...
It's-it's a big stereotype.

14:45.419 --> 14:47.044
- It's called "ironic."
- No, it...

14:47.130 --> 14:48.790
This is why Lily was perfect. She's Asian.

14:48.881 --> 14:50.541
- She's a prop.
- It's called "niche casting."

14:50.634 --> 14:52.258
Stop telling me what stuff is called.

14:52.344 --> 14:55.510
You're so blinded by the spotlight,
you can't see what's really going on here.

14:55.598 --> 14:56.842
Let's go again.

14:56.932 --> 14:59.470
All right, here we go. Let's roll, please.

14:59.559 --> 15:01.434
- Action.
- Oh, no!

15:01.520 --> 15:05.020
We are trapped in a city
of high furniture prices.

15:05.108 --> 15:09.271
Oh! Can no one protect us
from these high prices?

15:09.362 --> 15:13.574
- Look. Over there.
- Oh!

15:13.659 --> 15:15.865
It's Save-zilla.

15:15.954 --> 15:20.415
He's knocking down
prices on everything from bibs to cribs.

15:20.501 --> 15:23.371
- Half off on playpens.
- Ah!

15:23.461 --> 15:25.335
High chairs are low chairs.

15:25.422 --> 15:27.048
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.884
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Cut. What's the problem?

15:29.969 --> 15:33.303
Don't you think this commercial just might
be the teeniest bit racist?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.382
I mean, "Save-zilla"?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.349
It's not racist. It's satire.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.010
No, I know, but maybe we could
just tone it down a bit.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.648
Maybe not hit the accent so hard?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.476
This is the commercial you agreed to.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.560
Yeah, well, I know. I just...

15:45.654 --> 15:48.227
- I can't let my daughter do this.
- We had an agreement.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.858
Well, I also have the best attorney in
town, so do your worst.

15:51.953 --> 15:54.788
And by the way,
Lily is Vietnamese, not Japanese.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.866
There's a big difference,
but you wouldn't know that...

15:56.957 --> 15:59.035
because you're only interested
in seeing these children...

15:59.126 --> 16:02.412
as interchangeable stereotypes,
not human beings.

16:02.506 --> 16:04.913
Come on, Lily. Let's go.

16:05.008 --> 16:07.168
Cam?

16:07.261 --> 16:08.756
Cam. That's not...

16:08.847 --> 16:10.554
Hi, buddy.

16:14.143 --> 16:15.602
There we go.

16:15.687 --> 16:15.729
Goin' to meet your mother.

16:15.729 --> 16:17.722
Goin' to meet your mother.

16:17.814 --> 16:20.104
Figured it out all by myself.

16:20.193 --> 16:22.102
Two years ago,
we got our marriage license.

16:22.195 --> 16:23.773
We went to a little hot dog stand.

16:23.864 --> 16:26.899
She said it was the most romantic meal
she ever had in her life.

16:29.203 --> 16:31.077
That's it, isn't it?

16:31.164 --> 16:32.658
Yeah, that's it.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.996
Get this through your head: You can give me
the cold shoulder the rest of your life...

16:38.088 --> 16:39.582
Jack's not coming back.

16:39.672 --> 16:41.630
See, I could overlook the goofing off...

16:41.717 --> 16:43.424
but you could have been
seriously hurt today.

16:43.511 --> 16:47.093
Anybody puts my kid in danger
doesn't get a second chance.

16:47.182 --> 16:48.972
Ever.

16:49.058 --> 16:50.885
I'll see you later.

16:51.728 --> 16:53.270
Did you just call me your kid?

16:53.354 --> 16:55.146
Oh, geez.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.309
- You've never said that before.
- Sure, I have.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.228
Uh-uh.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.776
Well, of course you're my kid.
I mean, what do you think?

17:03.367 --> 17:06.236
- You're going to the wrong place.
- What?

17:06.328 --> 17:07.905
It's not your wedding license.

17:07.996 --> 17:09.490
- What is it?
- First kiss.

17:09.582 --> 17:11.123
No. Just tell me.

17:11.209 --> 17:14.079
I mean your first kiss with my mom.

17:14.963 --> 17:17.335
My God, you're right. Thanks.

17:21.428 --> 17:23.587
- The pier.
- Thanks.

17:23.681 --> 17:25.507
But maybe Sonya didn't make a mistake.

17:25.598 --> 17:27.842
Maybe she just met her soul mate
when she was young.

17:27.935 --> 17:31.021
No. No, no, no. That never happens.

17:31.106 --> 17:33.680
See, she threw her life away,
and now she wants out.

17:33.775 --> 17:35.234
Okay, let's cut the crap.

17:35.319 --> 17:38.688
We're not talking about some character
on a soap opera here, are we?

17:38.782 --> 17:41.902
No. No, we're not.

17:41.992 --> 17:43.536
Honey, I'm sorry.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.197
I don't want to hurt your feelings...

17:45.288 --> 17:50.034
but I've been feeling this way
for a really long time, and...

17:50.127 --> 17:52.619
Can we be honest with each other?

17:53.673 --> 17:56.045
He's kind of a doofus.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.961
I guess, but...

17:58.053 --> 18:00.175
I thought you liked that about him.

18:00.263 --> 18:03.264
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. No, I never did.

18:04.269 --> 18:07.970
Believe me, honey,
there are many better options out there.

18:08.063 --> 18:10.222
- Like who?
- I don't know.

18:10.317 --> 18:11.775
Off the top of my head...

18:11.860 --> 18:14.019
how about that cute guy
who delivers the pizzas?

18:14.112 --> 18:15.606
He's, like, 18!

18:15.697 --> 18:17.239
So?

18:17.325 --> 18:20.243
Don't mind me, ladies.
This is the last one.

18:20.327 --> 18:24.113
I've changed the batteries
in every last smoke detector in the house.

18:26.042 --> 18:29.743
Hey, Dad, I think I found a place online
where I can sell this organ.

18:29.839 --> 18:31.417
Can you drive me to the black market?

18:31.508 --> 18:33.631
I think they mean
a different kind of organ, buddy.

18:33.717 --> 18:35.212
Sweetie, why are you trying to sell that?

18:35.304 --> 18:37.675
In case things with Dad's job
get even worse.

18:37.765 --> 18:41.465
Honestly, I don't know why
everybody's making such a big deal.

18:41.561 --> 18:42.840
Everything's fine.

18:42.937 --> 18:46.805
It makes no sense! I changed every one.

18:46.899 --> 18:49.390
- I'm gonna call my dad.
- No. We're not calling anyone.

18:49.486 --> 18:50.981
I can handle this.

18:51.070 --> 18:53.907
Just need the ol' burglar basher.

18:53.990 --> 18:56.316
Is that your college cheerleading baton?

18:56.411 --> 18:59.245
Not when you're on the business end of it.

18:59.331 --> 19:01.407
But Phil...

19:01.499 --> 19:03.825
Oh! Oh, my God.

19:03.918 --> 19:05.877
Guess that one won't be chirping
anymore, will it?

19:05.962 --> 19:07.422
Honey...

19:07.505 --> 19:10.756
- Go after him.
- Oh, no. He just needs to blow off some steam.

19:10.844 --> 19:12.967
How's that for battery?

19:13.053 --> 19:15.046
Mom, like it or not,
you made a commitment.

19:15.139 --> 19:17.465
And maybe that doesn't mean
anything to you anymore...

19:17.560 --> 19:19.931
but you owe it to this family
to save your marriage...

19:20.020 --> 19:22.891
- and give it one more try.
- What?

19:22.981 --> 19:25.734
End o' the line, Smoky Joe.

19:25.818 --> 19:30.730
Look, Dad may be a doofus, but he is 10
times better than any pizza delivery boy.

19:30.824 --> 19:32.449
Go to him.

19:32.534 --> 19:36.284
- Did you...
- I just detected your ass getting kicked!

19:36.372 --> 19:39.242
Okay. Honey...

19:39.333 --> 19:41.041
Thought I forgot about you, didn't ya?

19:41.127 --> 19:43.251
- Nope.
- Phil, no. Stop.

19:43.339 --> 19:46.173
- I gotta stop the damn chirping.
- This isn't about the noise.

19:46.259 --> 19:49.259
Sweetie, you're having a bad day.

19:52.015 --> 19:54.588
- At the end of a bad month.
- I know.

19:54.684 --> 19:56.308
You know how scary that is, Claire?

19:56.395 --> 19:58.636
No. No, I don't...

19:58.731 --> 20:00.558
because you never tell me the bad stuff.

20:00.650 --> 20:02.441
You only share all the good stuff.

20:02.526 --> 20:04.353
Honey, what happened
to us being a team?

20:04.445 --> 20:06.522
Right? We're supposed
to lean on each other.

20:06.615 --> 20:08.240
Honey...

20:08.324 --> 20:10.400
I have faith in you.

20:12.330 --> 20:13.824
Mmm.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.835
- I must be catching your cold.
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.923 --> 20:22.666
Okay. You know what?

20:22.758 --> 20:25.331
Let's just get new smoke detectors.

20:25.428 --> 20:27.135
We already changed 'em out last year.

20:27.221 --> 20:29.677
- Remember, buddy? You helped me.
- Sure did.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.678
Wait a minute.
What'd you do with the old ones?

20:32.768 --> 20:34.512
You told me to throw them
in the garbage...

20:34.604 --> 20:36.680
so I put them in the attic
to make a robot.

20:36.773 --> 20:38.352
It's the old ones.

20:38.442 --> 20:41.230
The batteries are dying
and we can hear 'em through the vents.

20:41.321 --> 20:43.478
You did it, buddy. I'm sorry.

20:46.243 --> 20:48.236
- I love you.
- I love you.

20:52.123 --> 20:53.618
I did that.

21:01.593 --> 21:01.635
Oh. Must be the pizza I ordered.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.125
Oh. Must be the pizza I ordered.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.179
Pizza? You ordered pizza?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.886
Yeah. I was just sort of
in the mood, you know?

21:08.977 --> 21:10.933
But we had pizza a couple nights ago.

21:11.021 --> 21:14.057
I know, but I had an urge,
and when I get an urge, I get an urge.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.390
- Okay. Here, I'll get it.
- No, sweetie. I've got it.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.028
No, Mom. You're always asking me
to do things.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.736
I'll get it. Here. Just sit back, relax...

21:19.822 --> 21:21.613
- I'll get the pizza. Don't worry.
- Get the change.

21:25.662 --> 21:27.156
Here...

21:27.246 --> 21:29.654
And I think it's best
you don't come around here anymore.

21:35.631 --> 21:36.662
