WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.235
<i> [woman 1] There's been</i>
<i>  a number of deaths</i>
<i>  in the house.</i>

00:04.105 --> 00:06.271
-[Amy] You hear that?
-Is there somebody over there?

00:06.273 --> 00:08.273
<i> [woman 2] We've got shadows,</i>
<i>  we've got things slamming.</i>

00:08.275 --> 00:10.142
<i>  There was a faceless person.</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:13.312
Grabbed my wrist and said,
"Get out of my house."

00:15.282 --> 00:17.082
<i> -[Chip] Is she going upstairs?</i>
<i>  -[Adam] Yes.</i>

00:17.885 --> 00:19.318
Don't stay there.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.886
[softly] It got really
creepy in there.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.187
[Adam] Watch yourself.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.624
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:27.359
We just wanna
help this family.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.560
<i> [Adam] The living</i>
<i>  need our help.</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:29.995
Have you always been here?

00:29.997 --> 00:31.330
He was watching already.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.410
<i> [Amy] Adam and I are</i>
<i>  in Marlboro, Vermont,</i>

00:44.412 --> 00:48.113
<i>  to answer the call of</i>
<i>  Victoria Osborne</i>
<i>  and her family,</i>

00:48.115 --> 00:50.582
<i>  who own a 250-year-old inn.</i>

00:54.021 --> 00:56.321
-[Amy] Wow!
-[Adam] Well, here we are.

00:56.323 --> 00:59.191
[Amy] I mean, we're talking
about the second oldest

00:59.193 --> 01:01.060
structure in Vermont.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.930
What's awful is that,
these poor people

01:04.932 --> 01:06.065
like, bought this,

01:06.067 --> 01:09.168
hoping to run this successful
little Bed and Breakfast.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.970
And they've been plagued with
paranormal problems, since.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.473
It's got all the hallmarks
of a haunted house.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.341
We've got the footsteps,
we've got the shadows,

01:16.343 --> 01:17.810
we've got things slamming.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.045
But it's this added
layer of safety,

01:20.047 --> 01:21.914
that I think they're
super-concerned about.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.117
And so, they've been
living in fear for so long.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.219
And they've been trying
to get us here for so long

01:27.221 --> 01:29.188
-and we couldn't because
of travel restrictions.
-A year.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.322
-A year.
-Yeah.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.890
[Adam] Maybe, we should
go in and find out

01:31.892 --> 01:33.025
before anything else happens.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.626
[sighs] Let's go, meet them.

01:35.696 --> 01:36.995
I'm so curious.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.598
[Adam] Yeah, I'm concerned.
I'm worried for them.

01:49.844 --> 01:50.676
[Victoria] Hi.

01:50.678 --> 01:51.944
[Adam] Hi, how are you?
I'm Adam.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.146
-Victoria. It's nice
to meet you.
-[Amy] Hi. I'm Amy.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.848
It's nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.015
[Amy] Of course.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.485
What we've heard already
sounds super-concerning.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.488
Yeah... So...

02:02.490 --> 02:03.822
Everything also
in the last year

02:03.824 --> 02:05.124
has gotten a little bit worse,

02:05.126 --> 02:07.459
I think since the time
that you heard.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.295
We have a lot of...

02:11.165 --> 02:13.198
voices, we have
a lot of noises.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.334
We have guests, who have
experienced things

02:15.336 --> 02:17.035
that make them uncomfortable.

02:17.037 --> 02:20.539
And... we've been
grabbed and...

02:20.541 --> 02:23.208
-things, hit. Scratched.
-[Amy] Hit?

02:23.210 --> 02:24.275
[Adam] Really?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.245
<i> [Victoria] Yes, my daughter,</i>
<i>  Chelsea has.</i>

02:26.247 --> 02:29.014
<i>  At various times in</i>
<i>  the carriage house.</i>

02:31.485 --> 02:34.319
[Amy] Is there anything
that you do that seems to

02:34.321 --> 02:35.821
make activity happen?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.256
No.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.057
Well, it sounds like
there's a lot for us
to kind of look at.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.425
So, where should we start?

02:40.427 --> 02:42.194
[Victoria] Why don't we start
in the original part
of the house?

02:42.196 --> 02:44.096
[Amy] Right.
I didn't realize that

02:44.098 --> 02:46.632
there's an original part
and then additions.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.868
[Victoria] Yes, the original
house was built in 1769

02:49.870 --> 02:51.537
by Colonel William Williams

02:51.539 --> 02:53.272
<i>  when he was in</i>
<i>  the Vermont Militia.</i>

02:53.274 --> 02:55.140
<i> [Adam] Okay.</i>

02:55.142 --> 02:56.441
<i> [Victoria] Then,</i>
<i>  Simeon Adams came</i>
<i>  and built the second addition</i>

02:56.443 --> 02:57.676
<i>  in 1821.</i>

02:57.678 --> 02:59.044
<i> [Amy] Okay.</i>

02:59.079 --> 03:01.246
<i> [Victoria] Chelsea, she's been</i>
<i>  really doing the research.</i>

03:01.248 --> 03:02.915
<i>  'Cause after she moved in,</i>

03:02.917 --> 03:04.316
<i>  and everything</i>
<i>  started happening,</i>

03:04.318 --> 03:06.218
<i>  she became very curious.</i>

03:06.220 --> 03:08.921
<i> [Amy] And now, what happens</i>
<i>  in this room in particular?</i>

03:08.923 --> 03:11.957
This room itself
is kind of a...

03:11.959 --> 03:14.059
a listening point.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.196
We can hear
the walking upstairs,

03:18.432 --> 03:20.566
dragging around.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.100
This is the room
where our guest

03:22.102 --> 03:23.368
recently said she felt like

03:23.370 --> 03:25.270
somebody was reading
over her shoulder...

03:25.272 --> 03:26.071
as she was reading.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.239
Okay.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.809
[Adam] Is there any activity
in the bedroom, here?

03:30.811 --> 03:33.111
There's not, the activity
moves upstairs.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.314
-[Adam] Okay.
-So, we can head that way.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.220
[Victoria] Recently,

03:42.289 --> 03:44.189
this was the room where
the guest just ran out...

03:44.191 --> 03:47.259
-after he stayed here
and left.
-[Adam] Okay.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.928
[Amy] Like, ran out in
the middle of the night
or in the morning?

03:49.930 --> 03:50.996
He's toughed it out
till the morning.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.665
-[Amy] Okay.
-He came and he checked out.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.235
And he said, "What's the deal
with that painting over
the fireplace?"

03:56.237 --> 03:58.870
And we said, "We don't know."

03:58.872 --> 04:01.139
And he said,
"Well, my wife saw it too."

04:01.475 --> 04:03.008
And then, he left.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.343
And that was that.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.577
Saw what, though?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.145
[Victoria] That was it,
that was my question.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.248
-Is that an original painting?
-No.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.950
-Yeah, it looks like...
it's a print, right? Yeah.
-It's a reproduction.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.652
[Victoria] So, we don't even
know anything about it.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.321
[Adam] Besides the painting,

04:16.323 --> 04:18.624
what activity has
happened in here?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.359
This has a lot of footsteps...

04:20.361 --> 04:22.127
-in this room.
-Right. Okay.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.162
A lot of moving of the bed...

04:24.164 --> 04:26.164
that happens, you can
hear it downstairs.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.199
[Adam] Okay.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.235
My daughter won't sleep
in the room under us.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.904
-[Adam] Right.
-Because of, she constantly
hears noise in this room

04:32.906 --> 04:34.406
when she does.

04:34.408 --> 04:37.142
It's creepy here.
People get creeped out.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.311
We had a review saying
a woman was so creeped out

04:39.313 --> 04:40.178
that she couldn't stay.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.146
Wow!

04:42.983 --> 04:44.283
All right, well,
where should we go now?

04:44.285 --> 04:45.817
[Victoria] Let's head
down the hall

04:45.819 --> 04:47.719
and we can go,
visit room seven.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.321
So, you guys tonight
be really careful.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.089
This will be the place
where you guys start to

04:51.091 --> 04:53.725
get turned around
late at night.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.961
[Amy] I can see
why people don't wanna
come up here alone.

04:58.365 --> 05:02.034
[Victoria] So, just last week,
we had a lady stay in here

05:02.036 --> 05:03.335
and when she came
down for breakfast,

05:03.337 --> 05:05.137
she asked me, if there
had been an earthquake.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.939
And my response was...

05:07.941 --> 05:10.475
-"No, we live in Vermont."
-[Adam] Yeah.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.179
But she had been woken
up by her bed shaking.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.381
So much that she actually...

05:16.383 --> 05:19.284
looked up to see if there
had been an earthquake.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.653
Because it was such
a jarring experience.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.221
-Okay, wow!
-[Amy] That's crazy, okay.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.990
[Victoria] But she
was pretty nervous.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.726
[Adam] Anything else
happened in this room?

05:27.728 --> 05:30.729
[Victoria] So I'm a little
bit anal-retentive
about making the beds.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.131
And for a long time,
I would make the beds

05:33.133 --> 05:35.033
and I would be coming
to check a guest in

05:35.035 --> 05:37.069
and there'd be
a big hand print

05:37.071 --> 05:38.136
in the middle of the bed

05:38.138 --> 05:40.872
and it's happened
in every single room.

05:40.874 --> 05:44.076
[Adam] Where is the violent
activity happening?

05:44.078 --> 05:46.278
-[Victoria] That's in
the carriage house.
-Okay, all right.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.948
[Victoria] This is
the carriage house.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.185
Built in 1821, to house
the carriages.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.188
It served that purpose
until the 1980s, actually.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.289
-[Amy] Okay.
-[Victoria] When the...

05:57.291 --> 06:00.125
son of the former owner
actually lived in it.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.331
This room is...

06:08.068 --> 06:11.937
where I don't like to
come really the most.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.108
Our first year here,

06:16.110 --> 06:18.143
the ladies who were in this
room came down to breakfast,

06:18.645 --> 06:19.911
terrified.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.247
And they said that they
had stayed up all night

06:22.249 --> 06:25.283
because somebody was
moving furniture upstairs.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.386
And the ladies barricaded
themselves in here

06:27.388 --> 06:28.453
and were looking for a weapon.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.855
Mmm.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.023
<i> [Victoria] And then,</i>
<i> the door knob started to turn.</i>

06:32.025 --> 06:34.359
She said they heard
someone on the landing.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.328
And you know,
they were terrified.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.363
They were
legitimately terrified.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.932
The other thing is,
there is no upstairs.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.033
[Amy] Right.

06:42.035 --> 06:42.934
[Victoria] So,
there is nowhere

06:42.936 --> 06:44.436
anybody could be
moving furniture.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.371
-Okay.
-Even if it was like
a racoon or something,

06:46.373 --> 06:48.140
this is pretty much the roof.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.476
But ever since then,
it's been just...

06:51.478 --> 06:54.846
kind of one thing
after another.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.882
Things get thrown downstairs.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.284
I was in here, making beds

06:59.286 --> 07:02.254
and I heard someone
coming up the stairs.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.656
So, I turned around to say
something to my husband.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.958
Only, I look at the window
and he was over here.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.793
-Outside.
-Oh, yeah.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.528
-Okay.
-[Victoria] And...

07:09.530 --> 07:11.463
that's when I finished
cleaning rooms for the day.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.397
[Adam] Yeah.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.366
I don't like it up here.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.134
And I don't like
to scare our guests...

07:17.137 --> 07:19.337
but at the same time,
I can't imagine that

07:19.339 --> 07:20.872
every single person
who's ever stayed here,

07:20.874 --> 07:22.340
has never had an experience.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.009
I would bet that they just
aren't saying anything.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.143
Yeah, of course.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.711
I really worry,
there's a lot going on

07:26.713 --> 07:29.114
that I need to have not.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.084
<i> [Amy] Talking to Victoria, I</i>
<i>  can see how concerned she is.</i>

07:33.086 --> 07:35.086
We wanna help people
who are feeling...

07:35.088 --> 07:36.988
physically threatened
in their home.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.423
<i>  Like, they should</i>
<i>  not feel that way.</i>

07:38.425 --> 07:41.193
<i>  Especially, here, that's also</i>
<i>  operating as a business.</i>

07:41.195 --> 07:44.896
And so, Adam and I are
really, really...

07:44.898 --> 07:48.400
<i>  adamant that we have to</i>
<i> get this figured out for them.</i>

07:52.105 --> 07:53.338
[Adam] So, if we start...

07:53.340 --> 07:55.140
start on the listening
point, right?

07:55.142 --> 07:56.908
[Amy] That does seem
like a good starting point.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.110
And it's the original house,
which is important.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.446
-Right.
-So okay, well
let's head there.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.018
[Adam] Amy and I are sitting
in what Victoria calls

08:07.020 --> 08:08.186
the listening point.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.622
This is the place
where, you can sit

08:10.624 --> 08:12.858
when you're in the house
and you can hear activity,

08:12.860 --> 08:15.594
specifically above you
and in other places.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.096
So, we're gonna sit here
for a minute, see where
the activity...

08:18.098 --> 08:21.132
happens and go
where it takes us.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.369
<i> [softly] Let's see if</i>
<i>  anything pops up here.</i>

08:26.974 --> 08:29.508
[Adam] Is anyone here,
that's non-living?

08:29.510 --> 08:30.609
My name is Adam.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.012
[Amy] I'm Amy.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.181
[Adam] We use...

08:37.084 --> 08:39.651
these devices that
if you are here,

08:39.653 --> 08:42.220
you should be able to
interact with these items.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.456
Like listen to this.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.824
See this little device?

08:45.826 --> 08:48.260
This little grey device.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.095
So, if you speak into this,

08:50.097 --> 08:51.830
even if we can't hear
you with our ears,

08:51.832 --> 08:54.332
this little box can
sometimes here your voice.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.602
What is your name?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.607
Do you know Victoria?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.045
Do you have family?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.283
Did you... build this house?

09:14.321 --> 09:18.123
Did you add on
to this property?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.258
Did you build
on to this property?

09:21.361 --> 09:22.627
Do you remember the war?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.233
Which war?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.637
[Amy softly] He's not
doing anything.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.473
Let's listen to this.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.511
[recorder speaking indistinct]

09:46.653 --> 09:48.053
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  What is your name?</i>

09:52.926 --> 09:54.659
<i>  Do you know Victoria?</i>

09:56.163 --> 09:57.295
<i>  Do you have family?</i>

09:58.165 --> 09:59.063
<i> [recorder] No.</i>

10:09.509 --> 10:11.009
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Do you have family?</i>

10:11.111 --> 10:12.276
<i> [recorder] No.</i>

10:12.345 --> 10:15.280
-[Amy] Did it say "No"?
Do you have family?
-No?

10:15.282 --> 10:19.050
<i> [Adam on recorder] Did you</i>
<i>  add on to this property?</i>

10:19.052 --> 10:21.119
<i>  Did you build</i>
<i>  on to this property?</i>

10:23.857 --> 10:25.156
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Do you remember the war?</i>

10:25.158 --> 10:26.191
[static sounds]

10:26.193 --> 10:27.492
<i> [Amy on recorder] Which war?</i>

10:29.663 --> 10:32.430
Okay, so we got a "No" when we
said, "Do you have family?"

10:32.432 --> 10:35.467
Which... it's weird for that
to be the strongest answer.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.335
So, that's someone
on their own.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.438
But here's the thing,

10:41.174 --> 10:43.742
it's weird how this is
the listening point, right?

10:43.744 --> 10:46.978
The listening point, is that--
But I'm not hearing anything.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.180
Should we go up to
the shaking bedroom?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.415
[smacks lips]

10:50.417 --> 10:54.219
Yeah, let's go there and maybe
do some EVP work and see.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.926
[Amy] This bed
is super-sturdy.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.294
Like, really sturdy.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.162
[Adam] Yeah.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.364
[Amy] I cannot
imagine it shaking.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.069
[Adam] Is there anyone in
here that likes to get...

11:11.071 --> 11:13.438
people's attention
while they're sleeping?

11:19.179 --> 11:23.148
Somebody here that wants to...
shake this bed for us or...

11:26.720 --> 11:28.987
Who keeps...
Who was messing up the beds

11:28.989 --> 11:31.956
when Victoria was trying to
make perfectly made beds?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.626
Who was disturbing her?

11:35.929 --> 11:40.098
How many people like
you are here at the farm?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.601
All right, let's listen.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.270
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Who's messing up the beds</i>

11:45.272 --> 11:48.339
<i>  when Victoria was trying to</i>
<i>  make perfectly made beds?</i>

11:48.341 --> 11:50.408
<i>  Who was disturbing her?</i>

11:53.647 --> 11:57.882
<i>  How many people like</i>
<i>  you are here at the farm?</i>

11:57.884 --> 12:00.852
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  What year did you arrive</i>
<i>  at the farm?</i>

12:00.854 --> 12:02.687
<i> [Adam] What year</i>
<i>  did you arrive here?</i>

12:03.490 --> 12:04.989
-[Adam] Nothing.
-[Amy] Nothing.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.191
[Adam sighs]

12:06.193 --> 12:08.426
This has been extremely,
extremely quite.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.830
[Amy] It just seems
so strange to me.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.665
[Adam] If it's happening
all the time,

12:13.667 --> 12:16.534
it should be happening
right now.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.269
So what, you wanna
move to the master?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.205
Let's try that.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.007
<i> [Amy] You know, when someone</i>
<i>  comes to you and says that,</i>

12:23.009 --> 12:26.211
they're being physically
assaulted by a spirit,

12:26.213 --> 12:28.747
you know, that's the kind
of case that kind of

12:28.749 --> 12:30.048
moves to the forefront for us.

12:30.050 --> 12:34.319
<i>  But the house feels</i>
<i>  very comfortable to us.</i>

12:34.321 --> 12:36.988
<i>  I think, Adam and I are</i>
<i>  already pretty stumped.</i>

12:40.193 --> 12:41.759
So, first thing's first,

12:41.962 --> 12:44.329
-I need to see what's going on
with this painting.
-[Adam] Yeah, pull it.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.031
-Pull it down.
-[Amy] Let's take
this off the wall.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.567
[Amy] This doesn't
look terribly old.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.336
-[Adam] No.
-[Amy] '60s?

12:55.308 --> 12:56.808
I'm just wondering
maybe something

12:56.810 --> 12:59.244
happened with
the fireplace at some point.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.179
And that's why
they're getting the...

13:01.181 --> 13:02.914
creeps scared out of them.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.150
Let's aim the SLS camera
at it.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.954
[Adam] Is there
anyone up here...

13:11.024 --> 13:12.957
who is non-living,

13:12.959 --> 13:16.361
who could tell us more
about this print here?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.932
Or the fireplace?

13:22.869 --> 13:25.170
[Amy] Did something
happen by the fireplace

13:25.172 --> 13:26.304
that we should know about?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.072
Was someone injured or killed?

13:28.642 --> 13:29.574
Who are you?

13:33.246 --> 13:34.345
How old are you?

13:36.082 --> 13:37.448
Can you tell us your name?

13:40.253 --> 13:43.855
People have been afraid
of this picture, right here.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.825
Do you know why people
would be afraid of it?

13:46.827 --> 13:51.396
[Adam] Are you associated
with this picture?

13:53.967 --> 13:57.135
What year did you
stay here or live here?

13:58.905 --> 13:59.671
All right, thank you.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.305
[static noise]

14:02.809 --> 14:05.310
<i> [Adam on recorder] Something</i>
<i>  to do with this print,</i>

14:05.312 --> 14:07.278
<i>  or this frame</i>
<i>  by the fireplace?</i>

14:10.050 --> 14:11.182
<i> [Amy on recorder] Who are you?</i>

14:13.153 --> 14:14.752
<i>  How old are you?</i>

14:14.754 --> 14:18.356
<i>  People have been afraid</i>
<i>  of this picture, right here</i>

14:18.358 --> 14:20.925
<i>  But it's just a...</i>
<i>  It's not an actual painting.</i>

14:20.927 --> 14:22.060
<i>  It's just a print.</i>

14:22.062 --> 14:24.495
<i>  Do you know why people</i>
<i>  would be afraid of it?</i>

14:25.899 --> 14:29.400
<i> [Adam on recorder] What year</i>
<i>  did you stay here or</i>
<i>  live here?</i>

14:29.402 --> 14:31.069
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  All right, thank you.</i>

14:31.304 --> 14:32.470
Unbelievably quiet.

14:34.174 --> 14:37.208
I'm just not getting any
creepy vibes in this house.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.643
<i> [Amy] It's always</i>
<i>  disconcerting</i>

14:38.645 --> 14:40.912
when we get no
evidence on night one.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.181
And not only did we not
get any evidence,

14:43.183 --> 14:45.016
we just didn't get any
activity in general.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.651
It was very, very quiet.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.320
<i>  We have to get this</i>
<i>  figured out for them.</i>

14:50.657 --> 14:52.257
[Adam] However,
what is the location

14:52.259 --> 14:54.559
that she doesn't
like the activity at all?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.961
-And it's crazy
and it's intense?
-The carriage house.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.197
What they've reported
in these rooms is...

14:59.332 --> 15:01.666
pretty benign.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.635
But everything they're talking
about in the carriage house

15:03.637 --> 15:05.336
-is the more, kind of
aggressive stuff.
-Right.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.671
[Amy] So, yeah.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.206
It'll be important to
interview Chelsea and like,

15:08.208 --> 15:09.574
get the lowdown
from her too.

15:10.043 --> 15:10.975
Before we go up there.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.977
All right.
Well, I guess I'll just...

15:12.979 --> 15:15.179
start trying to get
some research done.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.650
<i> [Adam] It's very important</i>
<i>  for us to understand that</i>

15:18.652 --> 15:19.917
<i>  we've been here one night.</i>

15:19.919 --> 15:22.320
<i>  We had nothing happen,</i>
<i>  we had no activity.</i>

15:22.322 --> 15:25.823
But it doesn't mean that this
place isn't potentially
haunted.

15:25.825 --> 15:29.127
We just need to tap into what
makes the activity happen.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.729
<i>  Like, what is the trigger</i>
<i>  point for this activity?</i>

15:31.731 --> 15:35.433
<i>  Plus, what's happening</i>
<i>  in this part of the property</i>

15:35.435 --> 15:39.170
<i>  isn't necessarily</i>
<i>  the traumatic</i>
<i>  and dangerous stuff.</i>

15:39.172 --> 15:40.738
<i>  The things that they are</i>
<i>  very worried about,</i>

15:40.740 --> 15:42.140
<i> happens in the carriage house.</i>

15:46.346 --> 15:49.247
<i> [Amy] Today, we're talking to</i>
<i>  Victoria's daughter, Chelsea.</i>

15:49.249 --> 15:51.482
<i>  She actually lives</i>
<i>  in the carriage house.</i>

15:52.319 --> 15:54.752
<i>  She's also an</i>
<i>  amateur historian</i>

15:54.754 --> 15:57.889
<i>  and put her skills to use,</i>
<i>  researching the property.</i>

15:57.891 --> 15:59.657
You've been staying
here for how long?

16:01.127 --> 16:04.529
I have been in
here since... 2019.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.264
This got converted when?

16:06.266 --> 16:09.000
In the '60s into like,
a living space or...

16:09.002 --> 16:12.203
Yes, I think it started as
actually an antique store.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.037
-[Amy] Oh, okay.
-[Adam] Oh.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.272
-[Amy] That's cool.
-Yeah.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.108
And how long have you been
experiencing activity here?

16:17.110 --> 16:19.377
I am pretty much
the entire time.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.647
Okay and is it upstairs mostly
or is it in here as well?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.850
Most of what I hear
comes from upstairs.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.218
[Amy] You got scratched.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.854
Yeah, and that
happened upstairs.

16:29.856 --> 16:30.989
Actually, I've had...

16:30.991 --> 16:32.357
There's a little
doll over there

16:32.359 --> 16:34.258
that gets thrown
off the book shelf.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.427
-[Amy] Oh.
-[Chelsea] It's happened
multiple times.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.730
He's stuck down
with sticky tacks,

16:38.732 --> 16:41.065
so I don't know
how that happened.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.834
What's the most shocking
thing that's happened to you

16:42.836 --> 16:43.668
in this space?

16:45.171 --> 16:48.106
I was actually
having this dream

16:48.108 --> 16:49.874
and I opened a door

16:49.876 --> 16:52.210
and there was
a faceless person there.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.978
And they grabbed my wrist

16:53.980 --> 16:56.080
and said,
"Get out of my house."

16:56.082 --> 17:00.051
And I immediately woke up
and I could feel the breath...

17:00.053 --> 17:01.252
in my ear still.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.255
And I've heard them
talk to me before.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.823
-Okay.
-I also heard one of them say,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.158
"I wish I was still alive"

17:07.660 --> 17:10.028
Right when I first moved here.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.463
So this was like
a disembodied voice or...

17:12.465 --> 17:14.098
[Chelsea] Yeah,
I've never seen anything

17:14.100 --> 17:15.366
but I hear a lot.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.668
Male or female, that said,
"I wish I was still alive"?

17:17.670 --> 17:18.702
[Chelsea] Seemed male.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.204
Okay and where
was it coming from?

17:20.974 --> 17:23.174
-It was like right in my ear.
-Oh, in this area.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.676
Yeah, I was in bed
and it was right in my ear.

17:25.678 --> 17:26.611
-Oh, geez!
-[Adam] Oh!

17:33.653 --> 17:34.852
[Adam] What's in...

17:34.854 --> 17:36.087
[Chelsea] This is
my living room.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.422
There have also been...

17:38.458 --> 17:39.624
things in here.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.592
My friend staying here once.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.827
[Adam] Okay.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.064
And they... She heard somebody
saying her name in her ear.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.734
And she was sleeping
or in bed or was it just--

17:49.736 --> 17:51.135
The bed was right here.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.137
-[Amy] Okay.
-And she was
just sleeping in bed.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.972
I mean, I sit there,
that's my couch.

17:54.974 --> 17:58.042
And I hear conversations
happening upstairs.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.977
[Amy] The conversations,
are they angry?

17:59.979 --> 18:02.113
Or they're just like
normal conversing or...

18:02.115 --> 18:04.115
Some seem a little passionate.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.383
[Adam] Nobody's
upstairs, right?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.285
-Correct. Correct.
-[Adam] Nobody's renting.
Okay.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.855
What is your mindset in here?

18:10.857 --> 18:14.125
Are you scared
to stay in here?

18:14.127 --> 18:17.161
It is... It can be
really uncomfortable.

18:17.163 --> 18:20.264
I've noticed once I leave
the room for the night

18:20.266 --> 18:21.466
to go to sleep,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.234
I don't like coming
back in here.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.202
[Amy] Okay.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.404
After that, 'cause after
I close that door...

18:26.406 --> 18:27.872
-[Amy] Yeah, you're done.
-...I'm done.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.841
-I don't come back in here.
-Okay, you've like shut this.

18:29.843 --> 18:30.842
You've sealed this off.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.143
[Chelsea] Yeah
and I don't go upstairs.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.212
[Amy] You don't go
upstairs at all?

18:34.214 --> 18:35.179
[Chelsea] I avoid it if I can.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.314
Okay.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.882
[Chelsea] And I especially
try not to go alone.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.183
Okay. So that being said,

18:39.185 --> 18:41.352
you also have done a ton
of research on the property.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.187
-I have.
-[Amy] I... Okay.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.956
Do you mind if we
take a peek at that?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.557
Sure, so this is...

18:47.026 --> 18:48.626
what we have for...

18:48.628 --> 18:50.628
just sort of
the consolidated research.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.663
Oh, this is really great.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.099
[Chelsea] A general timeline
and then specifically...

18:55.101 --> 18:57.001
the deaths that I think,
happened on the property.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.402
[Amy] Oh, that's amazing.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.338
So, she's got all
the way up to current.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.873
-Really.
-That's great.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.441
[Amy] Has anyone ever
investigated here before?

19:03.443 --> 19:04.775
Not that I'm aware of.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.210
All of the previous owners,

19:06.212 --> 19:08.880
we've talked to a lot of them
and they all had experiences

19:08.882 --> 19:10.114
but they tried to keep that...

19:10.350 --> 19:11.482
really under wraps.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.817
They didn't want
that getting out.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.452
-Okay well, let's take this.
-Yeah.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.021
We'll get ready to investigate
and yeah, if you don't mind...

19:17.023 --> 19:18.723
vacating for a little bit.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.758
-[Chelsea] Not at all.
-So we come back here
later, that'd be awesome.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.060
-All right thank you, Chelsea.
-You're welcome.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.435
[Adam] You have
all the info, right?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.371
[Chelsea] I do, a few
people died in here.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.008
A number of babies were
stillborn in this house.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.676
So, you've got...

19:38.678 --> 19:42.013
Captain Simeon Adams,
whose daughter...

19:42.015 --> 19:45.816
had a set of triplets that
died at birth in 1825.

19:45.818 --> 19:50.488
There was, in 1855,
a stillborn baby.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.358
And then, another
stillborn baby in the house

19:54.360 --> 19:56.527
in November of 1860.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.095
These are all from
the Adams' family?

19:58.097 --> 20:00.064
Yes, there's three
on the Adams.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.266
We've yet to explore
the carriage house.

20:02.268 --> 20:04.335
Really, it's been
moving furniture

20:04.604 --> 20:05.736
for guests.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.039
She hears it above her head
and it's very aggressive.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.374
-She's physically
uncomfortable.
-Yeah.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.878
What if we split up upstairs
and do some spirit box work?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.946
[sighs] Let's do it.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.214
[Amy] All right.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.450
<i> [Adam] We need to</i>
<i>  get evidence tonight,</i>

20:19.452 --> 20:21.786
<i>  so we can figure out</i>
<i>  who's tormenting Victoria,</i>

20:21.788 --> 20:23.854
<i>  Chelsea, and their guests.</i>

20:23.856 --> 20:25.990
<i>  We're hoping the carriage</i>
<i>  house holds the key.</i>

20:29.896 --> 20:31.829
[Adam] You have
all of the info, right?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.264
[Amy] I do, so that's
why I was thinking

20:33.266 --> 20:34.465
if you wore the headphones...

20:38.771 --> 20:40.004
[Adam] What is that sound?

20:40.006 --> 20:41.339
-[Amy] Did you hear that--
-Male voice?

20:41.341 --> 20:42.306
Yeah.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.808
Did you guys say
something in there?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.209
Like, cleared your
throat or some--

20:45.211 --> 20:47.445
[Adam] You-- Andy, was that
you that went [clears throat]?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.182
[Amy] Did you hear
anything in there?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.084
I heard--

20:53.453 --> 20:54.385
It goes...

20:54.387 --> 20:55.486
-[exhales]
-[Amy] I don't know.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.955
[Adam] Weird.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.057
[Amy] So, let's try
this spirit box.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.898
[Amy] So, whoever's
here with me,

21:07.900 --> 21:10.501
my friend over there, Adam,
has something else.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.638
And you can talk
through that sometimes.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.072
You wanna give it a try?

21:15.642 --> 21:17.108
[Adam] Allow.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.011
You'll allow it? Okay. Great.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.380
Now first of all,

21:22.382 --> 21:24.015
what do you think of Victoria?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.187
Do you know the Adams?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.392
They lived here
for so many years.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.394
I think there were
multiple generations here.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.428
Thank you.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.132
That was male. Here.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.400
Okay.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.136
So, who's here? Are you...

21:45.138 --> 21:47.571
-I can't tell
because my friend--
-[Adam] I've been worried.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.208
[Amy] You've been worried?
About what?

21:52.845 --> 21:54.211
When did you live here?

21:54.213 --> 21:57.081
When did you live here
in your living form?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.182
What year?

22:01.154 --> 22:04.655
What about
Timothy Mather Adams?

22:04.657 --> 22:07.191
-Do you know who Timothy--
-[Adam] No.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.559
[Amy] No?

22:09.562 --> 22:11.329
What about Hugh Mather Adams?

22:11.698 --> 22:12.963
Ahh.

22:14.867 --> 22:15.966
Thank you.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.270
[softly] It's not really
making a lot of sense.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.172
Got a few things
but it's very...

22:22.275 --> 22:23.207
random.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.009
It's me.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.111
[Amy] It's you. Are you...

22:27.914 --> 22:29.447
-Mr. Osbourne?
-It's me.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.015
Watch yourself.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.423
[Amy] What do I need
to watch myself from?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.561
Don't come closer.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.299
[Amy] I won't, I'm over here.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.369
[softly] I don't... I mean,
this guy just sounds like

22:51.371 --> 22:53.471
he doesn't... he's upset.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.673
[Adam] I want you to like me.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.810
He's got a lot going on.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.313
I wonder why
he's upset, though.

23:02.315 --> 23:04.382
Sir, did you take your
own life by chance?

23:06.419 --> 23:07.551
Did you know...

23:10.423 --> 23:11.789
Are you kidding me?

23:11.791 --> 23:13.424
-[Amy] Okay.
-Okay.

23:15.361 --> 23:17.661
[Amy] He doesn't sound like
someone who passed away

23:17.663 --> 23:20.097
in the 1800's or 1700's.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.298
By the way, he's talking.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.334
[Adam] I'll forever be...

23:25.104 --> 23:26.137
a person...

23:28.441 --> 23:29.440
in my house.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.009
Okay.

23:32.678 --> 23:33.577
You don't wanna leave.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.347
This was your house.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.115
But you do know
that it's others'...

23:39.051 --> 23:40.584
home as well now, right?

23:41.154 --> 23:42.186
Do you get that?

23:42.422 --> 23:43.421
[Adam] I'm like...

23:44.424 --> 23:45.623
getting a headache.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.392
That was me.
That's me, saying that.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.627
It's like I'm getting
a headache.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.098
Can you tap him out?

23:56.469 --> 23:57.435
[Adam screams]

23:57.437 --> 23:58.469
[bleep]

24:02.942 --> 24:03.974
[Adam] How did that go?

24:03.976 --> 24:07.645
[Amy] At first, it was
making no sense at all.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.047
Then, towards the end, it
kinda started to make sense.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.850
It sounds like
a more modern ghost...

24:12.852 --> 24:14.652
-[Adam] Yeah.
-...than someone from...

24:15.421 --> 24:17.855
you know, say the 17 or 1800s.

24:17.857 --> 24:18.789
[Adam] Okay.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.224
[Amy] You said...

24:20.226 --> 24:21.625
They got very
offended when I asked

24:21.627 --> 24:23.828
if they took their own life.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.062
They were like,
"Are you kidding me?"

24:25.064 --> 24:26.196
-Okay.
-And then...

24:26.198 --> 24:29.066
You were like, "I'll forever
be a person in my house."

24:29.068 --> 24:31.869
Like, you don't wanna leave.
Like, he didn't wanna leave.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.938
And that was right when you
started getting a headache.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.406
Yeah, it was like
this, weird like...

24:36.676 --> 24:38.242
-Right here.
-[Amy] Yeah.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.910
It was like
a little like [squeaks].

24:39.912 --> 24:40.778
And I was like just weak.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.880
It was not super, super clear.

24:42.882 --> 24:46.150
Except towards the end,
it started to sound
very frustrated.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.319
And that's when I was like...

24:48.321 --> 24:51.188
I almost felt like we
were talking to someone

24:51.190 --> 24:53.257
who feels like they
have an identity

24:53.259 --> 24:54.959
as long as they stay here.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.627
-If that makes sense.
-[Adam] Yeah.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.330
Yeah, the second
they give up, or...

24:59.332 --> 25:01.165
I hate to use
the word but like...

25:01.167 --> 25:03.400
move on or cross over,
it's like...

25:03.402 --> 25:06.103
-They're gone gone. Yeah.
-Yeah, gone gone gone.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.539
And so, I don't know
who that could be.

25:09.408 --> 25:10.407
I don't know

25:10.409 --> 25:11.909
if this was someone
who was just here

25:11.911 --> 25:13.811
in the carriage house.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.280
-Right.
-And that's why
this ki-- That kind of...

25:16.282 --> 25:19.350
aggression isn't in the main
part of the building.

25:19.986 --> 25:20.985
I know what you're saying.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.987
Because the activity
is so very different

25:22.989 --> 25:24.054
-over there.
-[Amy] Yeah.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.589
Like here, it seems a bit...

25:26.359 --> 25:27.892
more intense.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.960
So, I think our
focus should be...

25:29.962 --> 25:33.097
sort of figuring out
who this guy is, right?

25:33.099 --> 25:34.732
[Amy] Yeah, maybe call
Chip tomorrow

25:34.734 --> 25:35.733
Yeah.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.837
<i> [Amy] I think a really</i>
<i>  unique scenario</i>

25:39.839 --> 25:42.373
<i>  for Adam and me right now,</i>
<i> is that we have uncovered that</i>

25:42.375 --> 25:45.142
<i>  yes, there is this kind</i>
<i>  of angry spirit here.</i>

25:45.144 --> 25:47.845
But now, we have to figure
out who this person is.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.114
Or have to figure
out how to fix it.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.182
Because this is their
livelihood on the line.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.985
Like, we cannot leave this,
this way.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.988
<i>  Because it could mean</i>
<i>  people will not want to</i>

25:57.990 --> 26:00.157
<i>  visit this inn and these</i>
<i>  folks are so kind</i>

26:00.159 --> 26:02.593
<i>  and have put so</i>
<i>  much into it already.</i>

26:02.595 --> 26:05.129
<i>  So that, I think is really</i>
<i>  what's gonna be driving us</i>

26:05.131 --> 26:06.630
<i>  through the rest</i>
<i>  of this investigation.</i>

26:09.235 --> 26:11.068
<i>  Last night's</i>
<i>  spirit box session</i>

26:11.070 --> 26:12.469
<i>  left us with</i>
<i>  a lot of questions</i>

26:12.471 --> 26:14.905
<i>  about the entity in</i>
<i>  the carriage house.</i>

26:14.907 --> 26:16.840
<i>  So far, it's the only suspect</i>

26:16.842 --> 26:18.976
<i>  for the more</i>
<i>  menacing activity.</i>

26:18.978 --> 26:21.111
<i>  Adam and I are</i>
<i>  about to call Chip.</i>

26:21.113 --> 26:22.680
<i>  We're gonna do things</i>
<i>  a bit differently.</i>

26:22.682 --> 26:24.949
Adam's gonna stay here,
talk to Chip.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.184
And we're gonna have Chip,
basically remote view

26:27.186 --> 26:29.253
through me and he will
give his impressions

26:29.255 --> 26:30.955
of what areas I am in.

26:31.324 --> 26:32.189
There he is.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.324
Hi, Chip.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.659
<i>  We're in a location,</i>
<i>  undisclosed location.</i>

26:35.661 --> 26:36.961
<i>  Obviously, you don't know</i>
<i>  where we are.</i>

26:36.963 --> 26:39.363
So Chip, just like we did
<i> on the USS Salem,</i>

26:39.999 --> 26:41.932
I will speak with you

26:41.934 --> 26:45.035
and you will connect
with Amy remotely.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.205
<i>  -She will speak to us</i>
<i>  though the walkie</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

26:48.207 --> 26:50.441
and you'll just tell her
what you're getting

26:50.443 --> 26:52.009
and direct her where to go.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.280
This place you're at is old.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.983
I mean, it feels really old.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.384
Like there's...

27:00.386 --> 27:03.053
There's a lot of residual
stuff that's going on there

27:03.055 --> 27:04.154
but yet there's...

27:04.156 --> 27:07.191
some intelligent,
interactive sort of...

27:07.193 --> 27:09.126
entities that are there
on the property.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.630
<i> And it feels like there's been</i>
<i>  a lot of people through</i>
<i>  this place.</i>

27:12.632 --> 27:16.000
<i>  And everybody's kind of left</i>
<i>  their own echo there.</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:19.503
<i> [Amy] Okay, I'm here.</i>

27:21.107 --> 27:23.173
Okay, she's there now, Chip.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.050
The one who is
getting stuff most

27:33.052 --> 27:35.519
in this space that
you're at is a female.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.288
Not that other people
don't tend to get things,

27:38.457 --> 27:40.157
but there is a...

27:41.427 --> 27:43.027
it's prominent
[clicks tongue].

27:43.029 --> 27:45.362
The activity is
prominent to a woman.

27:45.898 --> 27:49.099
<i>  And she's scared of it.</i>

27:49.101 --> 27:52.369
<i>  There's one particular</i>
<i>  female who...</i>

27:52.371 --> 27:54.905
<i>  either resides</i>
<i>  or spends a lot of time</i>

27:54.907 --> 27:57.307
<i>  in this place that you're at.</i>

27:57.309 --> 27:59.910
<i>  And she's kind of the one</i>
<i>  that's either the most</i>

27:59.912 --> 28:04.081
<i>  vulnerable or susceptible</i>
<i>  to what is going on in</i>
<i>  this place.</i>

28:04.083 --> 28:05.182
<i>  I think she's...</i>

28:05.651 --> 28:06.984
she's curious about it

28:06.986 --> 28:09.153
but she's also a little
unnerved and frightened

28:09.155 --> 28:10.921
by what's going on.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.524
And I'm wondering
if there's been some

28:13.526 --> 28:15.959
physical interaction
between her and the spirit.

28:16.429 --> 28:19.329
Like touching. Touching or...

28:19.331 --> 28:21.198
pinching or shoving
or something.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.733
There's been some
physical interaction

28:22.735 --> 28:23.934
between her and the spirit.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.370
Yeah, we're talking about
a living woman.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.172
<i> -[Chip] Correct.</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

28:28.174 --> 28:32.142
With a faceless person there
and they grabbed my wrist

28:32.144 --> 28:34.144
and said,
"Get out of my house."

28:34.146 --> 28:38.248
And I immediately woke up
and I could feel the breath

28:38.250 --> 28:39.650
in my ear, still.

28:39.652 --> 28:40.584
[Adam] Okay.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.119
Can she continue?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.121
<i>  Yes.</i>

28:47.460 --> 28:48.625
<i> [Chip] Is she going upstairs?</i>

28:48.627 --> 28:49.927
Yeah, she's going upstairs.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.962
I'm in the carriage
house, upstairs.

28:54.767 --> 28:55.665
Don't stay there.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.108
[Adam] What? Why?
What are you getting?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.009
<i> [Chip] Wherever she's at,</i>

29:06.011 --> 29:08.278
<i>  there is this...</i>
<i>  there is a spirit of a man,</i>

29:08.280 --> 29:09.613
<i>  who frequents that area.</i>

29:10.316 --> 29:11.949
He's an [bleep].

29:18.224 --> 29:21.558
And it has the possibility
to affect the woman.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.994
[softly] Okay.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.329
He wasn't well liked in life

29:25.331 --> 29:27.464
and he's probably not
well liked in death.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.868
I am in the other
side of that space.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.035
If he is getting anything.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.339
He's not done.

29:35.341 --> 29:38.342
He wasn't done with
what he was there to do.

29:39.044 --> 29:41.311
He was-- His pity was death.

29:43.949 --> 29:47.518
I also heard one of them say,
"I wish I was still alive."

29:47.520 --> 29:50.554
Are you picking up anything
else on that space...

29:51.190 --> 29:52.222
specifically?

29:53.359 --> 29:54.258
No.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.562
All right, I'm gonna
turn the AC back on

29:58.564 --> 29:59.596
<i>  and heading that way.</i>

30:00.900 --> 30:01.632
Copy that.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.337
[whispering] Okay.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.074
I will say,
the second you left,

30:11.076 --> 30:12.576
it got really creepy in there.

30:13.646 --> 30:14.878
[Amy] I have no idea.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.146
[chuckles]

30:16.148 --> 30:17.080
[Adam] Thank you, Chip.

30:17.082 --> 30:17.915
We really do appreciate it.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.017
<i>  If anything else pops up,</i>

30:20.019 --> 30:22.119
<i>  we will contact you but</i>
<i>  you have been of help.</i>

30:22.121 --> 30:23.420
<i> [Amy] Thank you, sir.</i>

30:26.025 --> 30:28.025
I mean, he picked up
on a few things in
the carriage house.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.127
He didn't like that
space, obviously.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.495
I mean, I will say that

30:31.497 --> 30:32.629
when we were
filming out there,

30:32.631 --> 30:34.765
the second Georges left...

30:34.767 --> 30:37.067
Like he went out to kinda
get me coming down the stairs,

30:37.069 --> 30:39.837
so he went outside and I went
back to turn on the AC.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.272
The vibe got really
creepy, really quick.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.041
When I was by myself.
I was like, "Okay...

30:44.043 --> 30:45.509
Now I get it."

30:45.511 --> 30:47.110
Like I can see why people
don't wanna come up
here alone.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.011
Oh!

30:48.013 --> 30:49.379
I have a weird experiment
I wanna try.

30:49.381 --> 30:54.184
What if I go out there
and I show this... spirit

30:54.186 --> 30:55.385
footage of what we do?

30:55.788 --> 30:56.520
Okay.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.989
[Amy] Like show him that...

30:58.991 --> 31:02.025
if he talks to us
and communicates with us,

31:02.027 --> 31:04.161
that he will be
remembered forever.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.063
[Adam] If he doesn't
communicate with us...

31:06.999 --> 31:08.832
-He'll absolutely
be forgotten.
-Yeah.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.167
[Amy] I'd like to know
who that guy is

31:10.169 --> 31:11.368
before he gets a lot of hand.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.970
Yeah, we'll have to
go, check it out.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.005
<i> [Adam] We know the spirit</i>
<i>  in the carriage house</i>

31:15.007 --> 31:16.139
<i>  is afraid of being forgotten.</i>

31:16.141 --> 31:17.908
<i>  So, we're using that desire</i>

31:17.910 --> 31:20.744
<i>  to draw more</i>
<i>  information from him.</i>

31:20.746 --> 31:23.847
<i>  We're demonstrating that</i>
<i>  unlike the other living</i>
<i>  people he's encountered,</i>

31:23.849 --> 31:25.949
<i>  he can actually</i>
<i>  communicate with us.</i>

31:25.951 --> 31:28.852
So, whoever's been up
here talking to us,

31:28.854 --> 31:31.855
we just really wanted
to show you what we do.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.124
We wanted you to understand
where we're coming from

31:34.126 --> 31:36.026
and we're trying to help you.

31:36.028 --> 31:39.263
So, we have some
videos to show you of...

31:39.832 --> 31:41.465
people we've helped before.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.368
And now, keep in mind too,
this is a judgement-free...

31:44.370 --> 31:46.904
situation, so please watch.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.940
This... This little-- This...

31:49.942 --> 31:53.610
clip is when Amy and I were
helping someone named
Willamina Crocker.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.445
She is non-living

31:55.447 --> 31:58.148
but she did not know
that she was non-living.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.317
She did not know that
she had passed on.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.019
And we helped her.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.289
...listen.

32:05.891 --> 32:06.657
[Amy on recorder]

32:11.463 --> 32:13.397
It says, "Death certificate."

32:16.936 --> 32:18.535
[Amy on recorder]

32:21.240 --> 32:22.506
I'm going home.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.408
Says, "I'm going home."

32:25.044 --> 32:26.043
So, she left.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.045
She went wherever...

32:28.146 --> 32:29.179
you can go.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.248
You don't have to,
of course but...

32:31.250 --> 32:33.617
once she realized
what had happened,

32:34.219 --> 32:35.152
she moved on.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.987
And so...

32:36.989 --> 32:39.623
we were able to help
her in that way and...

32:39.625 --> 32:41.291
her story has been told
over and over again.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.827
And actually, her head stone,
her grave stone,

32:43.829 --> 32:45.862
people have been regularly
putting flowers on it

32:45.864 --> 32:47.898
ever since this happened.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.467
And nobody had
done that for decades.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.501
[indistinct whispering]

32:52.137 --> 32:53.070
Yeah.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.952
Do it.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.989
Okay so, who are
we talking with?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.324
My friend is listening
to the headphones.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.926
I guess...

33:15.928 --> 33:17.461
[Adam] Yeah,
like I was yesterday

33:17.463 --> 33:18.962
she's listening to it now.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.063
Can you talk to her?

33:22.167 --> 33:23.333
Maybe tell her...

33:25.070 --> 33:26.970
if you want anything,
need anything.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.338
Tell us why you're still here.

33:28.340 --> 33:32.175
I mean yesterday, it felt like
you didn't wanna be forgotten.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.112
You understand we're not--
No one's gonna forget you.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.481
Right? Because this is
gonna be seen by...

33:38.784 --> 33:39.949
millions of people.

33:40.085 --> 33:41.985
They're gonna know that
there is somebody in this...

33:42.654 --> 33:43.587
Just one.

33:44.757 --> 33:46.089
Hey.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.625
No, more than one
person's gonna watch this.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.262
It just said
something really bad.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.532
I cannot repeat but
it was a derogatory term.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.534
Starts with an F.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.236
Oh, great. Cool.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.445
[Amy] I don't like boys.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.214
I'm not... I'm not as--

34:11.750 --> 34:12.649
What?

34:12.651 --> 34:14.818
This is really weird.
[chuckles]

34:14.820 --> 34:16.286
-Like, what?
-[Amy] I'll find someone.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.654
[Adam] Oh, great. Cool.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.425
If you're not a nice
person, then we don't...

34:22.361 --> 34:23.860
and you know,
you don't need our help,

34:23.862 --> 34:25.162
then we'll just stop trying.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.965
You want us to stop trying?

34:31.036 --> 34:33.437
So, tell me what your name is.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.206
Naked.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.278
[Adam] What...
I am not getting naked.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.080
You can stop that.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.981
I don't know what you're
talking about-- You want...

34:44.983 --> 34:46.349
You want us to get naked?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.218
Makes no sense.

34:49.021 --> 34:50.087
Three-way.

34:51.023 --> 34:52.389
Ew!

34:52.391 --> 34:54.991
This man is a pervert.
You're a perv.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.994
Okay look, dude,
like I'm not...

34:57.996 --> 34:59.196
I don't want
anything from you.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.064
None of us do.

35:01.066 --> 35:02.966
We just wanna find out
why you're still here

35:02.968 --> 35:03.834
because you're dead.

35:03.836 --> 35:05.335
You're dead.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.137
You no longer are
part of the living.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.105
You're not like us.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.140
We have power over you.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.342
We have control over you.
Like, you can't harm us.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.378
You are not gonna
be able to harm us.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.647
-Who is this kinky...
-Oh, [bleep]

35:17.649 --> 35:19.149
I'm sorry, the last...

35:20.018 --> 35:21.718
I don't know dude. [giggles]

35:21.720 --> 35:24.187
-Who is this kinky dude?
-Like, I'm like, "Can we
even use this?"

35:24.189 --> 35:28.125
If there is even four things
said that I'm not saying.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.392
Like...

35:29.394 --> 35:30.994
The last thing
it was like talk...

35:30.996 --> 35:32.796
It was like,
"Sometimes we make out."

35:32.798 --> 35:34.064
-[giggles] Like, I was like...
-[Adam] No.

35:34.066 --> 35:36.533
-What the [bleep]?
-Okay, so...

35:36.535 --> 35:39.069
This is not at all what
I, how I expected it to go...

35:39.071 --> 35:40.670
[Adam] No.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.939
-I don't know what to do.
-I feel like a junior
high schooler right now or--

35:42.941 --> 35:45.842
-[Adam] I'm sweating
because of it. God!
-Me too, I'm totally sweating.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.078
I mean, this is
what I got, okay?

35:48.080 --> 35:49.946
And you can correct
me if I'm wrong, but like...

35:49.948 --> 35:52.415
the person that was talking
to you yesterday is...

35:52.417 --> 35:54.184
probably the same
person, but like...

35:55.521 --> 35:57.654
He understands
what's happening now.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.089
Like, he gets it.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.192
It's like this guy...

36:02.194 --> 36:04.094
wants to have fun.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.962
He understands
what we're doing

36:05.964 --> 36:07.464
but he's just messing with us.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.166
[Amy] I think so too.

36:09.234 --> 36:11.935
-It was... I got that vibe.
-Or it's just like, you know.

36:11.937 --> 36:15.071
He was like, "Let me just
think of the naughtiest
things to say."

36:15.073 --> 36:16.373
[Adam] The big
takeaway from this

36:16.375 --> 36:18.842
is the women were in here.

36:18.844 --> 36:22.045
-[Amy] Yeah.
-And both Chelsea and Victoria

36:22.047 --> 36:23.914
have had experiences here,
they don't like to
come up here.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.651
And the second
I was left alone, I felt...

36:27.653 --> 36:30.086
creepy. I was like "Oh!" It
felt like I was being watched.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.455
Could feel the breath
in my ears.

36:32.457 --> 36:35.058
My friend, she heard
somebody saying her name

36:35.060 --> 36:36.125
in her ear.

36:38.397 --> 36:42.165
And it has the possibility
to affect the woman.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.135
I will say,
the second you left,

36:45.137 --> 36:47.003
it got really creepy in there.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.738
Do you know what
it reminds me of?

36:48.740 --> 36:50.407
We never talked about
this on the show

36:50.409 --> 36:53.376
but there is a hotel,
the Mount Washington.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.780
There is that
spirit of Steve...

36:56.782 --> 36:57.981
[Adam] Yes!

36:57.983 --> 37:00.984
...that goes to room 314
and if you're up there,

37:00.986 --> 37:02.052
he shows up.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.154
Like literally, people
see this person

37:04.156 --> 37:07.724
as though they're a living man
and he shows up and he's like,

37:07.726 --> 37:08.892
"Who wants to party?"

37:08.894 --> 37:10.293
-[Adam] Yeah.
-"What, you guys wanna party?"

37:10.295 --> 37:12.429
And like, people have
called security on this guy

37:12.431 --> 37:14.464
before and security's
like, "That's Steve."

37:15.000 --> 37:17.133
He's not... He's a ghost.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.102
Maybe this guy,
maybe something happened.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.136
Maybe he...

37:20.138 --> 37:21.404
was partying too hard.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.907
Who knows?
Maybe the story will come out

37:23.909 --> 37:25.275
but he's not
telling us his name.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.643
[Adam] I'm telling you,

37:26.645 --> 37:28.912
this dude up here, he
understands the circumstances

37:28.914 --> 37:30.080
now and he's just
messing with us.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.348
-Okay.
-So, we know who you are.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.116
We get it, we understand.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.818
You don't have to
tell us your name yet.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.119
Maybe you'll tell
it to somebody.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.288
But just continue
being respectful

37:38.290 --> 37:39.656
of the ladies, please sir?

37:40.759 --> 37:41.924
Because...

37:42.027 --> 37:44.461
They could just make unlife
very difficult for you.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.495
-Yes.
-So...

37:45.497 --> 37:47.230
[Adam] I'll say,
we don't believe

37:47.232 --> 37:49.799
in crossing people over.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.870
However, if the family
doesn't want you here,

37:53.872 --> 37:56.640
they could put that intention
into the environment.

37:58.343 --> 38:01.278
<i> [Amy] This is one of those</i>
<i>  moments where you have</i>
<i>  to empower yourself.</i>

38:01.280 --> 38:03.046
Imagine if there was this man

38:03.048 --> 38:04.147
standing right
in front of you,

38:04.149 --> 38:05.448
saying these things to you.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.484
Would you be afraid and cower?

38:07.486 --> 38:08.885
Or would you be like, "Hey,

38:08.887 --> 38:10.353
I don't deserve to
be talked to like that.

38:10.355 --> 38:11.721
Like, have some respect."

38:11.723 --> 38:14.057
That's how you would
handle that situation

38:14.059 --> 38:16.259
and that's how anyone else
needs to handle that situation

38:16.261 --> 38:17.727
going into that room.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.963
<i>  You just let him know,</i>
<i>  just like any other...</i>

38:19.965 --> 38:23.466
<i>  you know, creepy dude that,</i>
<i>  "Hey, not cool. Cut it out."</i>

38:23.468 --> 38:27.003
<i>  We got secondary</i>
<i>  evidence with the DVR.</i>

38:27.005 --> 38:29.205
<i>  So, I think we're gonna</i>
<i>  have to empower</i>

38:29.207 --> 38:32.042
<i>  Chelsea and Victoria</i>
<i>  with that information</i>

38:32.044 --> 38:34.110
<i>  and honestly, we've had</i>
<i>  to do this many times.</i>

38:34.112 --> 38:36.279
<i>  We've had to humanize</i>
<i>  these ghosts.</i>

38:36.281 --> 38:39.249
And realize that being
afraid only makes it worse.

38:39.251 --> 38:40.884
The second you
start talking back,

38:40.886 --> 38:41.951
you're not fun anymore.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.420
So, I'm guessing,

38:43.422 --> 38:45.355
you know, if people go
into this knowing that

38:45.357 --> 38:46.322
<i>  with this gentleman,</i>

38:46.324 --> 38:48.158
<i>  he's probably not</i>
<i>  gonna stick around.</i>

38:50.028 --> 38:52.662
[Amy] We've got, I think,
some new information for you

38:52.664 --> 38:55.832
and I think we've kind of got
a handle on what's going
on here.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.133
-So...
-Oh, great.

38:57.669 --> 38:58.968
So, the first thing.

38:58.970 --> 39:02.205
So, we investigated night
one up in the portrait room

39:02.207 --> 39:04.274
and nothing really
happened for us.

39:04.276 --> 39:06.676
I did some research
and the portrait actually

39:06.678 --> 39:08.044
is a portrait of Jenny Lind,

39:08.046 --> 39:10.647
who was a famous opera
singer in the Victorian era.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.950
So, does this picture
look familiar to you?

39:13.952 --> 39:16.286
-[Amy] Oh yeah, that's
our lady upstairs.
-It is.

39:16.288 --> 39:18.588
So, this doesn't have
anything to do with...

39:18.590 --> 39:20.890
this house or this location
'cause I researched.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.326
-Yeah.
-She mostly lived in London,
at the end of her life.

39:23.328 --> 39:25.428
Had no connection to Vermont.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.797
The person who painted this
had no connection to Vermont.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.532
But it's just a print.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.668
-So it's not really... Yeah.
-It's a print from
the National Portrait Gallery.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.803
So, the activity has
nothing to do with this.

39:33.805 --> 39:34.871
<i> -[Amy] Right.</i>
<i>  -For sure.</i>

39:34.873 --> 39:36.373
[Adam] We had
cameras everywhere

39:36.375 --> 39:38.308
and we caught something
that we're gonna show you.

39:38.310 --> 39:39.676
You wanna watch
on that doorway.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.611
<i> [Adam] Yeah, you can</i>
<i>  look in that doorway.</i>

39:42.647 --> 39:43.913
<i>  -You see that?</i>
<i> -[Victoria] Yeah.</i>

39:43.915 --> 39:45.915
I do.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.650
-[Adam] It's like it's going,
just going down--
-[Amy] Kinda goes to room 3.

39:47.652 --> 39:50.320
<i> [Victoria] Like, "Hey,</i>
<i>  I'm just gonna walk around.</i>
<i>  Make sure everything's okay."</i>

39:50.322 --> 39:52.021
<i> [Amy] So, what do</i>
<i>  you think about that?</i>

39:52.257 --> 39:54.023
I mean...

39:54.025 --> 39:56.292
I'm not a 100 per cent
shocked by it.

39:56.294 --> 39:58.895
But it is interesting to
actually, finally see

39:58.897 --> 40:01.297
something after all of this
time of being in the house

40:01.299 --> 40:04.801
and having various
things happen.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.670
And it's really
fascinating to look at that.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.839
[Amy] We also, we did
some investigating

40:09.841 --> 40:11.674
in the carriage house.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.209
And instantly,
I was like, "Wooh!"

40:13.211 --> 40:15.011
"The vibe in here
just changed.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.981
And it seemed to, you know,
females in that area sense it.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.916
You sense it,
Chelsea senses it,

40:19.918 --> 40:22.852
those two ladies who were
up there had that issue.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.320
Basically, this guy

40:24.322 --> 40:26.022
used some very
colorful language

40:26.024 --> 40:28.525
and it sounded
like somebody who...

40:28.527 --> 40:30.493
really just either
was messing with us

40:30.495 --> 40:31.828
or wants to party.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.664
Or is like, living in
this moment of...

40:34.666 --> 40:36.299
something that
we can't explain.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.834
[Amy] But here's
the problem with this guy.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.003
He's just out
of control spirit

40:40.005 --> 40:42.238
that you need to handle
the same way you would handle

40:42.240 --> 40:44.274
a living man
talking to you, like that.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.075
It would be like,
"Cut this [bleep].

40:46.077 --> 40:47.677
-Do not talk to me that way."
-Right.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.279
Like that's really what
it comes down to.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.448
Like if you...

40:51.450 --> 40:54.117
are up there and you start
feeling that feeling,

40:54.119 --> 40:56.219
you need to go, "No,
that's not gonna fly here."

40:56.221 --> 40:57.320
I can do that.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.255
Well, you and Chelsea,
specifically,

40:59.257 --> 41:01.257
can definitely control
that situation.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.159
That's good to know.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.929
Knowing that,
what do you think?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.831
It explains the kind
of creeper feeling.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.232
-[Amy] Yeah.
-It really does.

41:09.234 --> 41:13.036
Like, somebody's there
and I don't want to be
in the same place.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.871
I'm just really
excited that it's...

41:14.873 --> 41:17.207
nothing sad.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.108
'Cause that was
really upsetting me.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.211
Or you know, nothing
scary or dangerous.

41:21.213 --> 41:22.045
[Amy] Right. Yeah.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.214
'Cause I was very concerned.

41:24.216 --> 41:26.082
I mean, some people are
really into coming somewhere

41:26.084 --> 41:27.350
that's, you know, haunted

41:27.352 --> 41:29.085
but there are a lot
of people who aren't.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.153
Yeah.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.755
I mean, I think in general,
people need to know,

41:32.757 --> 41:35.325
that if you're gonna go
to an inn in New England

41:35.327 --> 41:39.028
that was built in 1769,
there's probably gonna
be ghosts there.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.363
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.931
-[Veronica] That just
makes sense.
-Yeah. All right.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.801
-Thank you so much. I really
enjoyed having you here.
-Thank you.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.436
Victoria really
seemed relieved

41:46.438 --> 41:49.005
at what we documented
in the main house

41:49.007 --> 41:51.241
and she seemed more than happy

41:51.243 --> 41:53.409
to deal with whatever's
in the carriage house.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.111
So, I think overall,

41:55.113 --> 41:56.980
<i>  it's a win-win.</i>

41:56.982 --> 41:59.148
<i>  It's a wonderful place</i>
<i>  and we would recommend</i>

41:59.150 --> 42:01.384
<i>  that anyone come here,</i>
<i>  it's very safe.</i>

42:01.386 --> 42:02.285
<i>  But haunted.</i>
