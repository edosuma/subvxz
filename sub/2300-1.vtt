02:09.922 --> 02:12.216
My babies!

03:39.846 --> 03:41.055
Arthur?

03:57.947 --> 03:59.615
Daddy?

03:59.699 --> 04:01.325
Coming.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.006
Do you like it, Daddy?

04:16.507 --> 04:18.050
Very much.

04:19.719 --> 04:23.181
- You didn't look at it properly.
- Of course I did.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.643
That's me, that's Nanny,

04:27.727 --> 04:31.522
that's Mummy, and that's you.

04:33.191 --> 04:34.609
Why do I look so sad?

04:34.692 --> 04:37.445
That's what your face looks like.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.530
It is, is it?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.909
I wish you didn't have to go away from me.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.119
Me, too.

04:45.203 --> 04:48.915
But we'll have the whole weekend
in the countryside, won't we?

04:48.998 --> 04:51.000
See, tomorrow,

04:52.168 --> 04:53.920
then Thursday,

04:54.962 --> 04:57.673
and then we're back together.
Not long at all.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.723
You look just like your mother.

05:06.891 --> 05:09.143
- Have you got the train tickets?
- Yes, we've got the train tickets.

05:09.227 --> 05:11.354
- And you know all the times?
- Yes, we know the times.

05:11.896 --> 05:15.149
Okay, I've got to go
. Don't want to be late.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.485
Go, we'll be fine. We'll see you Friday.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.946
- See you.
- Wave bye-bye.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.248
I know you've had it rough, Kipps,

05:30.331 --> 05:34.126
and I'm sympathetic to your situation.

05:36.838 --> 05:39.423
But we can't carry passengers.

05:40.424 --> 05:43.803
We're a law firm, not a charity.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.306
Good.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.684
I take it Tomes has briefed you

05:49.767 --> 05:54.647
on Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.525
Died. Last month.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.528
Years since I went there, of course.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.740
The old widow
didn't greatly care for visitors.

06:05.741 --> 06:06.784
No children?

06:09.120 --> 06:11.956
A boy. Died young.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.584
Many years ago.

06:14.667 --> 06:18.045
I'll let you have the details
to read on your journey.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.632
But, principally, you're going to go
through Mrs. Drablow's documents.

06:22.258 --> 06:24.802
Make sure we've got her final will.

06:24.886 --> 06:27.221
There's a mountain of paperwork
at the house.

06:27.305 --> 06:30.558
- It all needs to be gone through. Every page.
- Very good.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.227
We've been dealing with
a local man, Jerome.

06:33.311 --> 06:35.813
But he's not really been cooperating.

06:38.816 --> 06:43.404
What I'm hoping, Kipps,
is that you'll seize this chance

06:43.487 --> 06:48.367
to prove your dedication
to pursuing a future with this firm.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.622
This is your final warning.

07:35.373 --> 07:36.791
Mummy?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.502
- Mummy.
- My darling.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.084
Mr. Kipps.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.756
It's a boy.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.312
I'm very sorry, Mr. Kipps.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.629
Have we passed Crythin Gifford yet?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.715
Next stop.

09:13.512 --> 09:17.266
- So, you're up from London?
- I am.

09:17.892 --> 09:20.311
Trying to sell Eel Marsh House?

09:23.189 --> 09:25.232
You won't find a local buyer.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.573
- Are you staying at The Gifford Arms?
- Yes.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.868
It's a bit of a walk from the station.
I can give you a lift.

09:35.951 --> 09:39.205
- It's on my way home.
- Thank you.

09:39.663 --> 09:43.334
- Samuel Daily.
- Arthur Kipps.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.129
It's a beautiful car, Mr. Daily.

09:47.213 --> 09:50.758
First one in the county.
Still scares the locals.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.009
Here we are.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.678
Well, thank you.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.432
Very good to talk to you, Mr. Daily.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.187
Mr. Kipps?

10:03.771 --> 10:06.524
Would you like to have supper with
my wife and me tomorrow evening?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.818
You know, we don't get to see
many new faces here.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.821
Besides, the food in there,
reckon even a dog wouldn't eat it.

10:11.904 --> 10:14.990
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.
- Night.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.498
Good evening.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.501
I've a room booked until Sunday. Mr. Kipps.

10:29.088 --> 10:31.257
No, I'm not finding any booking.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.800
My office had telegraphed ahead.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.219
Well, we're packed to the rafters. So...

10:38.055 --> 10:39.515
- Evening.
- Good evening.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.226
I was just telling Mr. Kipps
that we don't have any room.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.022
Well, we can't have him out
in this weather, can we?

10:47.106 --> 10:48.399
Not in the rain.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.819
We must have something, just for tonight.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.487
We don't.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.407
Unless you want to put him in the attic?

10:59.285 --> 11:00.327
Fine.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.959
It's this way.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.389
Actually, I was hoping to stay
till the weekend.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.892
My son and his nanny
are traveling up to join me.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.352
I see.

11:28.105 --> 11:32.693
If a holiday is what you're after, sir, you'd
honestly be better off further inland.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.862
It gets awfully cold here,
what with the sea mists.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.282
Sea mist. Sea mist.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.702
It's this way.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.882
- How old is your son?
- He's four.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.467
Lovely age.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.144
Thank you.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.616
Goodnight.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.157
In.

13:45.701 --> 13:46.785
Hello?

14:02.593 --> 14:04.845
Mrs. Jerome?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.722
- Mr. Kipps?
- Yes.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.559
My husband went to meet you
at The Gifford Arms.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.815
This is Mr. Kipps.

14:17.941 --> 14:21.028
I made it clear to your firm that there was
no need for you to make the journey.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.530
We could have sent all
the relevant documents to London.

14:23.614 --> 14:27.326
In any event, you'll find
all the legal papers in here.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.287
Mr. Fisher tells me you're leaving today.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.541
Not until I've taken care
of all Mrs. Drablow's paperwork.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.960
- All in there, as I said.
- No, at the house.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.754
I'm told there's quite
a substantial amount.

14:38.837 --> 14:42.132
I don't expect to be finished
until Friday, at least.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.678
It's not possible.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.972
The Gifford Arms is fully booked
for the week.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.894
I shall have to contact my office.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.563
Do you have a telephone?

14:56.647 --> 15:00.317
Not even Mr. Daily has a telephone, sir.
You'll not find one in Crythin Gifford.

15:00.401 --> 15:01.652
Fine. I'll send a telegram.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.489
The Post Office is closed
on Wednesday morning.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.282
The London train leaves in half an hour.

15:07.366 --> 15:10.619
My colleague, Keckwick, is waiting
outside with your luggage.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.497
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kipps.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.471
Mr. Keckwick, a change of plans.

15:29.555 --> 15:32.182
I'm not catching the train.
You'll take me to Eel Marsh House.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.810
Jerome paid me to take you to the station.

15:42.693 --> 15:45.863
- Make it six and I'll think about it.
- Six shillings?

15:46.488 --> 15:49.491
You'll not find anyone else
willing to take you there.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.689
There you are.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.782
- Can you pick me up at 3:00?
- I can't.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.117
I need to get back to the mainland
before the tide comes in,

17:15.202 --> 17:17.246
else I'll be stuck here for the day.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.540
It will be out again by 5:00.
I'll come back for you then.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.291
5:00 then.

24:08.657 --> 24:09.866
Come on, then.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.666
Hello?

25:33.199 --> 25:34.617
Who's there?

25:53.887 --> 25:54.971
Get the boy!

25:55.055 --> 25:56.056
Keckwick!

26:02.979 --> 26:04.314
Mummy!

26:06.357 --> 26:07.776
Get the boy!

26:30.882 --> 26:33.718
<i>Constable, I'm telling you,
I heard an accident.</i>

26:34.135 --> 26:37.680
No one has used Nine Lives Causeway
for years, sir.

26:38.264 --> 26:42.185
Not since the little Drablow boy
was drowned in the marshes.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.771
Eel Marsh House, it's empty.

26:44.854 --> 26:47.357
It's not, though. I saw a woman there.

26:52.362 --> 26:54.697
Excuse me one moment, sir.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.586
Sir, my sister needs help.

27:09.921 --> 27:12.090
What's the matter?
What's your name, darling?

27:12.173 --> 27:14.676
- Her name is Victoria Hardy.
- What happened, Victoria?

27:14.759 --> 27:16.970
- Did something bad happen?
- She drank some lye.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.638
Our mum was out.

27:19.514 --> 27:22.100
Lye. Oh, God. Constable!

27:22.183 --> 27:24.477
- Is she going to die?
- Constable!

27:24.561 --> 27:27.147
It's going to be all right.
Darling, just let me look at you...

27:33.403 --> 27:34.612
Constable!

27:47.250 --> 27:49.586
No!

27:50.670 --> 27:54.924
No, my baby!

28:52.148 --> 28:53.483
Hello?

28:54.192 --> 28:56.027
Mrs. Fisher?

29:32.772 --> 29:35.858
It's getting late.
You'll miss your London train.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.529
I can't leave yet.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.533
Please don't go back to Eel Marsh House.

29:43.908 --> 29:44.909
Why?

29:46.077 --> 29:50.081
Mr. Kipps, you said you have a son?

29:50.164 --> 29:51.666
Yes.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.252
Go home to him.

29:54.752 --> 29:58.256
Cherish him. Love him.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.719
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

30:16.399 --> 30:18.776
- Mr. Kipps.
- Mr. Daily.

30:20.278 --> 30:21.863
- Glad you could make it.
- My pleasure.

30:21.946 --> 30:25.074
I'm just bidding my son,
Nicholas, goodnight.

30:26.159 --> 30:29.537
- My condolences, Mr. Daily.
- It was a long while ago.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.958
There's a place ready in there
for my wife and me,

30:34.042 --> 30:37.587
so we can all be together again one day.
Come.

30:39.380 --> 30:42.342
I heard about the girl in the village.

30:42.425 --> 30:45.053
Terrible. Are you all right?

30:46.387 --> 30:47.597
Yes.

30:49.098 --> 30:51.059
My wife doesn't know

30:51.142 --> 30:54.604
and I'd be grateful
if you could avoid the subject.

30:55.104 --> 30:59.567
Indeed, the subject of children altogether,
if at all possible.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.696
He would have been about your age now.

31:03.780 --> 31:05.656
Thank you, Archer.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.245
There you are, dear.

31:11.329 --> 31:13.581
Mr. Kipps, I've been
so looking forward to meeting you.

31:13.664 --> 31:16.042
I'm sorry, I must look a bit of a mess.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.252
I found myself without a room.

31:18.336 --> 31:21.381
Well, then he must stay with us,
mustn't he, Samuel?

31:21.464 --> 31:22.882
Indeed he must, my dear.

31:23.216 --> 31:25.218
- Arthur.
- Thank you.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.554
The twins won't be dining
with us tonight, Archer.

31:28.638 --> 31:31.307
Samuel, I'm sure Mr. Kipps won't mind.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.434
Not at all.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.269
Emily!

31:37.688 --> 31:38.815
Thank you.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.400
There.

31:40.483 --> 31:42.902
Now, say hello to Mr. Kipps.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.905
Hello.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.657
Thank you, Archer.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.581
There.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.252
You're married, Mr. Kipps?

31:59.335 --> 32:02.338
No, don't gobble. That's rude.

32:02.964 --> 32:05.174
- Any children?
- A son.

32:05.258 --> 32:09.011
That's lovely.
You don't want to end up like us.

32:10.847 --> 32:14.100
Wealthiest folk in the county
and no one to leave it to.

32:16.644 --> 32:18.688
- Did he tell you about Nicholas?
- Elizabeth.

32:19.272 --> 32:20.857
That's him.

32:22.233 --> 32:25.528
I painted that myself.
I love to paint and sketch.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.363
It's lovely.

32:27.905 --> 32:30.074
Nicholas loved to sketch, too.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.247
- He still does.
- Elizabeth, please.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.251
He wants to draw you a picture.

32:41.294 --> 32:42.378
Elizabeth.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.715
Elizabeth, no!

32:50.511 --> 32:51.721
Elizabeth!

32:53.139 --> 32:54.932
Archer, the medication!

32:55.016 --> 32:57.059
- No.
- Medication!

32:59.228 --> 33:00.813
No, no.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.212
I thought some company
would do her good.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.380
Please, think nothing of it.

33:26.464 --> 33:31.093
She's convinced it's our son
speaking through her.

33:33.346 --> 33:36.766
You don't believe
in this spiritualism stuff, do you?

33:38.559 --> 33:40.561
I didn't.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.107
But since my wife passed away,
I don't know.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.777
Forgive me. I didn't...

33:50.112 --> 33:54.784
Sometimes I feel she's still with me.

33:56.911 --> 33:58.996
Sometimes I just

34:00.206 --> 34:02.875
feel she's there. In the room.

34:04.544 --> 34:06.671
Trying to reach me.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.755
Well, you must be careful, Arthur.

34:08.839 --> 34:12.176
These charlatans
with all their talk about séances

34:12.260 --> 34:14.554
and contacting the dead.

34:14.637 --> 34:17.264
They prey on those most in need.

34:17.348 --> 34:19.516
They do more harm than good.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.228
I think the worst they do is disappoint.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.567
I have to keep looking.

34:29.527 --> 34:33.447
It's not natural to lose someone so young.

34:35.449 --> 34:38.494
But if we open the door to superstition,
where does that lead?

34:40.329 --> 34:43.040
It's just chasing shadows, Arthur.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.835
When we die, we go up there.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.714
We don't stay down here.

35:22.079 --> 35:25.875
Come on. Come on. Lie down.

36:12.713 --> 36:15.299
I'll lose my job
if I don't get this paperwork done.

36:15.633 --> 36:19.053
If Jerome gives me some help,
I can go and meet my boy.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.348
I doubt if Jerome will be much help to you.

36:32.942 --> 36:34.235
Stay, Spider.

36:42.284 --> 36:43.661
Mr. Jerome?

37:33.419 --> 37:34.754
Go away!

37:35.921 --> 37:37.131
I'm not going to hurt you.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.133
You killed Victoria Hardy.

37:40.009 --> 37:41.469
Get away from me!

37:41.552 --> 37:42.720
Go!

37:43.179 --> 37:46.557
Go! Go!

37:49.226 --> 37:52.271
- What the hell is going on?
- Complete nonsense.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.815
Let's get you to the house.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.538
You should have left.
You should have gone when we told you to.

38:09.622 --> 38:10.706
John.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.625
His little girl is dead.

38:14.376 --> 38:15.711
You saw her.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.756
You saw that woman at the house.

38:19.465 --> 38:23.636
For God's sake, take him home.
This isn't helping him.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.263
All your superstitious rubbish.

38:28.057 --> 38:30.976
You think this is superstitious rubbish
that took your boy?

38:41.654 --> 38:42.988
All right.

38:44.073 --> 38:46.075
I'll take him to the station.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.435
<i>Pay no attention to them.
They're still living in the Dark Ages.</i>

39:13.519 --> 39:15.896
<i>But I did see someone at the house.</i>

39:15.980 --> 39:20.109
<i>Trust me, Arthur. It's just an old
place cut off from the world.</i>

39:20.901 --> 39:26.407
The sooner the house is sorted out and
sold, the sooner people can move on. Here.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.409
This'll keep you going.

39:30.828 --> 39:33.455
The late tide is due at 11:00.
I'll come back for you then.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.333
It's fine.
I'd rather just work through the night.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.046
Well, take the dog.

39:41.130 --> 39:42.464
Come on, girl.

39:44.967 --> 39:46.427
Just for company.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.305
Don't go chasing shadows, Arthur.

47:54.581 --> 47:55.957
<i>Dear Alice,</i>

47:56.041 --> 47:59.378
<i>you leave me no option
but to give up my son.</i>

47:59.461 --> 48:00.754
<i>If you have your doctors</i>

48:00.837 --> 48:05.217
<i>deem me mentally unfit to raise my child,
what can I do?</i>

48:05.801 --> 48:09.096
<i>You and Charles can take him from me,
but he is mine,</i>

48:09.179 --> 48:12.432
<i>mine, he can never be yours.</i>

48:13.141 --> 48:14.226
<i>Jennet.</i>

48:34.538 --> 48:35.747
<i>Dear Alice,</i>

48:35.831 --> 48:41.670
<i>I find it hard to express the depth
of betrayal from you, my own sister,</i>

48:41.753 --> 48:44.548
<i>at your refusal to let me visit my son</i>

48:44.631 --> 48:47.050
<i>or even give him my birthday cards.</i>

48:47.134 --> 48:49.970
<i>I begin to believe you're not doing this
for the good of the boy,</i>

48:50.053 --> 48:52.514
<i>but to cause me pain.</i>

48:52.597 --> 48:54.724
<i>He is mine.</i>

48:54.808 --> 48:57.519
<i>If you won't let me see
him, I will find a way.</i>

49:14.411 --> 49:16.413
<i>You didn't try to save him.</i>

49:16.496 --> 49:19.166
<i>You just saved yourself.</i>

49:19.249 --> 49:21.793
<i>You didn't even give him a proper burial.</i>

49:21.877 --> 49:24.212
<i>You just left him there in the mud.</i>

49:27.799 --> 49:30.177
<i>His blood is on your hands.</i>

49:31.344 --> 49:34.181
<i>I will never forgive you.</i>

49:34.264 --> 49:36.308
<i>Rot in hell.</i>

51:15.657 --> 51:17.951
<i>He will never be yours.</i>

58:38.099 --> 58:39.100
Who's there?

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:50.828
You don't believe me, do you?

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:56.542
I believe even the most rational mind
can play tricks in the dark.

01:03:58.127 --> 01:04:03.090
I saw them, Sam. I saw her and her boy.

01:04:04.467 --> 01:04:07.011
No. The boy was lost to the marsh.

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:09.847
His body was never recovered.

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:13.893
I saw them.

01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:22.735
Oh, my God!

01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:29.992
No, don't...

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:36.374
Lucy!

01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:40.795
Lucy!

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:42.922
Arthur!

01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:45.758
- No! No!
- Arthur!

01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:47.134
Arthur!

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.456
Stay there. I'm going to come and get you.

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:29.427
No!

01:07:14.323 --> 01:07:15.699
Arthur?

01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:20.913
Here.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:37.680
I remember when
the Jeromes lost their first child.

01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:45.229
They decided to have another. Lucy.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.483
They locked her up to protect her.

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:55.739
- Not that you can ever replace...
- She was there, Sam.

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:02.997
You're tired.

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:05.332
Get some rest.

01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:01.471
What happened to him, Mrs. Daily?

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:06.018
He was playing at the
beach with his friends

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.604
and they said the tide
must have caught them off guard.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.490
You've seen her, haven't you?

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.285
She was there this morning in the fire.

01:09:24.912 --> 01:09:26.788
She's always there.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.417
You mustn't blame yourself.

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:35.381
- Blame myself for what?
- For not listening to the others.

01:09:35.464 --> 01:09:37.591
For not staying away from the house.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.594
What? I don't understand.

01:09:43.096 --> 01:09:45.265
Whenever she's been seen,

01:09:46.642 --> 01:09:50.229
on the causeway, on the marsh,
in the grounds of the house,

01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:52.856
however briefly and whoever by,

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:57.861
there has always been
one sure and certain result.

01:09:57.945 --> 01:09:59.113
Yes?

01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:06.120
In some violent or dreadful circumstance,
a child has died.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:08.789
So many... So many children.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:11.333
So many children.

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:16.046
The Fishers' daughters and Jeromes' eldest.

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:20.092
Keckwick's son, my Nicholas.

01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:21.468
How?

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.097
Mrs. Daily?

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:28.267
Mrs. Daily?

01:10:30.436 --> 01:10:34.898
She makes us... She makes us do it.

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:37.818
<i>She makes us.</i>

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:40.320
<i>They took her boy</i> away.

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:42.865
<i>So now she takes us.</i>

01:10:57.463 --> 01:10:59.006
She saw you.

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.508
She saw you.

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:04.261
She's coming.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:07.306
She's coming.

01:11:13.896 --> 01:11:15.939
- Elizabeth!
- Sam!

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.525
- Sam!
- Elizabeth!

01:11:19.193 --> 01:11:21.028
No, Elizabeth. No! No!

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:30.496
Elizabeth.

01:11:40.047 --> 01:11:41.423
Joseph.

01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:48.263
If we can get the telegram off now,

01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:50.182
we can catch them
before they get on the train.

01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:52.142
How could you take me to Eel Marsh?

01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:54.770
If even a small part of you
feared the stories were true?

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:57.606
- But I never believed them.
- No, you didn't want to.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.775
- There's a difference.
- I had no choice, Arthur.

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:02.152
Either Nicholas is in a better place

01:12:02.236 --> 01:12:05.572
waiting for us to be reunited one day,
or he's lost.

01:12:05.656 --> 01:12:07.324
Now which would you
have chosen to believe?

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:11.537
Forgive me, Sam, but my son is alive.
He's on his way here.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.169
No.

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:23.090
The next village is over an hour away.

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:26.218
They'll have left by then.

01:12:29.555 --> 01:12:32.266
What time is the tide back out?

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:34.351
5:00. Why?

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.981
If we can reunite Jennet Humf rye
with her son,

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:41.859
perhaps she'll finally be at peace.

01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:44.528
They never recovered
the child's body, Arthur.

01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:46.989
But you have something they never had.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:09.321
Arthur?

01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:31.051
Sam, I feel it. It's just beneath my feet.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:35.389
Just give me a moment while I tie it.

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:37.057
Be careful.

01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:06.920
Arthur?

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:10.674
Oh, my God.

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:50.797
Keep driving.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:01.558
Don't stop!

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:03.477
The pedal's on the floor.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:15.781
I've found the boy.

01:16:24.998 --> 01:16:26.500
Can you go any farther?

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.756
The engine's overheating!

01:16:33.924 --> 01:16:35.634
Come on.

01:16:38.178 --> 01:16:40.180
Sam, please, it's sinking.

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:49.397
Hurry!

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.075
Here, here.

01:17:33.984 --> 01:17:36.945
Let's just put him in the ground, Arthur.

01:17:37.028 --> 01:17:38.905
Let's get it over with.

01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:41.408
Sam,

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:44.744
there's something I need to do first.

01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:47.831
They're lost.

01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:53.170
They need to find each other.

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:53.647
Nearly time now.

01:20:17.188 --> 01:20:18.773
Come on.

01:20:42.547 --> 01:20:43.798
Nicholas?

01:21:15.622 --> 01:21:16.623
Daddy?

01:21:28.468 --> 01:21:29.469
Arthur!

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:40.934
Arthur.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:50.193
I think she's gone.

01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:27.772
Thank you.

01:25:38.509 --> 01:25:42.722
<i>I will never forgive you
for letting my boy die.</i>

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:45.683
<i>I will never forgive.</i>

01:25:45.767 --> 01:25:48.061
<i>Never forgive.</i>

01:25:49.562 --> 01:25:53.316
<i>Never forgive. Never forgive.</i>

01:25:53.983 --> 01:25:58.279
<i>Never forgive. Never forgive.</i>

01:26:06.079 --> 01:26:08.915
One step, two step. Good boy.

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.550
- Joseph!
- Daddy!

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:37.151
Joseph, this is my friend, Sam.

01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.821
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Joseph.

01:26:39.904 --> 01:26:41.114
It's very nice to meet you.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.325
Change of plans.
We're not staying here tonight.

01:26:44.409 --> 01:26:45.785
We're going straight back to London.

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:49.622
Can you fetch us some tickets?
I'll explain on the way.

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:55.086
You're sure you don't want to rest up
before you go?

01:26:55.169 --> 01:26:57.296
Yes, I just want to get him home.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.715
I understand.

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.468
Three tickets back to London, please.

01:27:03.219 --> 01:27:06.597
- Will you and Elizabeth be all right?
- We will.

01:27:07.807 --> 01:27:09.851
Then you must come down to London
and visit us.

01:27:09.934 --> 01:27:11.769
Elizabeth would love that.

01:28:38.064 --> 01:28:39.440
Sam?

01:28:54.789 --> 01:28:57.917
Daddy? Who's that lady?

01:29:08.678 --> 01:29:10.221
That's your Mummy.
