WEBVTT

00:02.837 --> 00:04.903
I'm starved!

00:04.905 --> 00:07.139
- How much longer, dad?
- Patience, Brian.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.607
[gasps]
Oh!

00:08.609 --> 00:10.642
Patience.

00:10.644 --> 00:11.977
Before we start,
I've got to be sure

00:11.979 --> 00:13.645
The gas line
is connected.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.980
He's stalling.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.281
He lost the instructions

00:16.283 --> 00:17.583
and couldn't
get this thing started

00:17.585 --> 00:19.318
with a flame thrower.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.521
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.123
[sighs]
I'm afraid we can forget about

00:24.125 --> 00:25.858
cooking these
spare ribs, Willie.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.893
Kate, this is
a backyard Blitzer.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.595
It'll cook anything.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.563
See what you can do with this.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.300
There's no meat
on these bones.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.536
Stop! Stop right there.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.339
I couldn't sit idly by

00:40.341 --> 00:43.976
and watch you people
clog your arteries.

00:43.978 --> 00:47.880
Sometimes I think
I care too much.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.949
[sighs]
Well.. At least
we've got the hamburgers.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.752
You know, Willie, it, it kind of
looks like it's gonna rain.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.622
Well, it's just a few clouds.
It'll blow off any minute.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.357
[thunderclap]

00:58.359 --> 01:00.392
Any minute now.

01:02.129 --> 01:05.297
The weather report
said sunny skies.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.199
[thunder rumbling]

01:07.201 --> 01:09.535
And me without sun block.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.906
[theme music]

01:39.867 --> 01:42.868
[music continues]

02:12.700 --> 02:13.765
[thunder rumbling]

02:13.767 --> 02:16.468
[instrumental music]

02:17.872 --> 02:19.338
Well, do we
have everything?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.106
Hamburgers,
paper plates..

02:21.108 --> 02:23.575
I've got the vegetables
and the potato salad.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.345
I've got the buns
and the coleslaw.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.313
That's everything, Kate.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.849
Why do I get the feeling
we forgot something?

02:30.851 --> 02:33.685
Nope. That's everything.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.720
[metal clanking]

02:34.722 --> 02:35.921
Willie!

02:37.958 --> 02:41.560
Oh, yeah. He's pinned
underneath the grill.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.794
I didn't want to embarrass him

02:42.796 --> 02:45.130
by drawing
undue attention to it.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.268
[Willie grunts]

02:49.270 --> 02:52.871
Oh. Oh, honey!
You're drenched!

02:52.873 --> 02:55.274
Really? I hadn't noticed.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.177
I was too busy flailing.

02:58.179 --> 03:01.547
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine.

03:01.549 --> 03:05.317
- No thanks to--
- Oh, this is my fault.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.619
Did you or did you not

03:07.621 --> 03:09.655
knock the barbecue over on me

03:09.657 --> 03:12.090
when you were
running into the house?

03:12.092 --> 03:13.458
Oh, that.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.294
That was my fault.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.595
Willie, get out of
those clothes right away.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.130
Before you catch a cold.
You too, kids.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.299
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.135
You don't catch cold from
going out in the rain, Kate.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.204
That's an old wives' tale.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.273
Hence Kate's knowledge of it.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.409
There's a reason old wives
get to be old wives.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.444
They stay warm and dry.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.413
No, I was just reading
an article about that

03:34.415 --> 03:35.847
in one of my
scientific journals.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.783
It said that volunteers
who were subjected

03:37.785 --> 03:39.251
to rapid temperature changes

03:39.253 --> 03:42.287
and cold water
did not catch cold.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.223
[sneezes]

03:44.225 --> 03:47.059
<i> - Gesundheit.</i>
- Hmm.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.061
I told you, honey.
You're catching a cold.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.197
No! Nonsense, Kate.
One sneeze does not a cold make.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.699
[sneezes]

03:55.236 --> 03:57.002
Just out of curiosity

03:57.004 --> 04:00.138
how many sneezes
does a cold make?

04:00.140 --> 04:03.041
[instrumental music]

04:03.043 --> 04:06.011
Have some soup.
You'll feel better.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.312
Thanks.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.714
I really appreciate the way

04:08.716 --> 04:10.182
you've been putting up with me.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.551
Oh, you can't help it.
You're a man.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.388
I'll just ignore that.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.323
But thanks, though.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.892
I have enjoyed
the peace and quiet.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.295
(ALF)
'Yo! Willie!'

04:23.297 --> 04:25.831
When I could get it.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.333
[sighs]
I'll get you some more tissues.

04:28.335 --> 04:31.236
Willie, you're
a whiter shade of pale.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.308
As a matter of fact,
I'm feeling a lot better.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.210
Oh, good!

04:38.212 --> 04:41.079
You could have taken
a turn for the worse.

04:41.081 --> 04:44.449
Developed pneumonia,
ended up in box city

04:44.451 --> 04:47.552
Left us with nothing but Kate's
shaky career in real estate.

04:49.189 --> 04:52.124
Does the phrase "thin ice"
mean anything to you?

04:54.528 --> 04:57.029
No.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.898
You know, I think I ought to
call the office.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.434
Maybe I could
squeeze in a half a day--

05:02.436 --> 05:03.769
No. No, you need your rest.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.504
You stay right where you are.

05:05.506 --> 05:10.942
Really? I mean, you get to lie
around all day, eat, watch T.V.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.211
How many people
get to do that?

05:15.382 --> 05:17.516
I said "people."

05:18.152 --> 05:20.385
[sneezes]

05:20.387 --> 05:21.953
What was that?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.122
- What was what?
- You sneezed.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.924
I did not.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.826
[sneezing]

05:29.196 --> 05:31.963
I think you've
caught my cold.

05:31.965 --> 05:36.401
Impossible. I told you before,
Melmackians never get sick.

05:36.403 --> 05:39.438
Only inferior, backwards
species get sick.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.709
No offense.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.010
Just to be on the safe side

05:45.012 --> 05:47.012
you better go upstairs
and lie down.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.915
Okay, but I'll
need the microwave

05:49.917 --> 05:52.317
The T.V., the V.C.R.

05:52.319 --> 05:56.388
And "Police Academies"
one, two, three, and six.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.526
Four and five lacked the pathos

06:01.528 --> 06:03.995
and emotional underpinnings
of the others.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.533
[instrumental music]

06:21.682 --> 06:23.215
Kate!

06:23.217 --> 06:25.684
He's back!

06:25.686 --> 06:28.620
But it's lonely upstairs.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.857
Besides, I have to scream
four or five times

06:31.859 --> 06:34.593
before Kate hears me
from up there.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.262
I heard you the first time.
I was changing the baby.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.932
Into what?

06:42.703 --> 06:46.338
Make him go. Make him go.
Make him go.

06:46.340 --> 06:49.174
Oh, can't I stay here
with you, please?

06:49.176 --> 06:51.777
Please, please, please,
please, please?

06:52.713 --> 06:55.313
You know, ALF..

06:55.315 --> 06:56.882
...I was predisposed

06:56.884 --> 06:59.518
to kick you
right out of here..

06:59.520 --> 07:01.920
...but when you
started whining..

07:04.858 --> 07:06.858
You know, Willie, it would be
a lot easier for me

07:06.860 --> 07:08.727
If you'd let ALF
stay in here for a while.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.229
What?! Oh!

07:11.231 --> 07:14.166
- Alright.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.234
Thanks, honey.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.373
Say...whatever happened

07:21.375 --> 07:25.844
to your celebrated
immunity to illness, anyway?

07:25.846 --> 07:28.880
Well, I've been
thinking about that.

07:28.882 --> 07:32.050
Some Melmackian scientists
thought that our immunity

07:32.052 --> 07:35.420
Came from the pollen of
this certain shrub in our diet.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.222
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.658
We called it Carl.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.927
Carl Shrub.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.964
Stay on your side of the bed.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.700
Huh.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.081
Willie?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.282
[groans]

08:06.353 --> 08:07.552
Willie?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.755
What?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.824
You have the feather pillow.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.960
I have the foam.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.195
I don't like foam.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.602
You.. A-choo!

08:25.239 --> 08:27.772
You want my pillow?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.142
Not anymore.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.385
Chocolate cake.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.622
I'm gonna put in an order
for chocolate cake.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.624
You want anything?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.726
Leave her alone.
Leave the woman alone.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.462
Are you sure you're not hungry?

08:50.464 --> 08:52.597
The brisket is very good today.

08:52.599 --> 08:56.167
I can also personally recommend
the canned beans.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.071
[sighs]

09:18.025 --> 09:21.026
[instrumental music]

09:21.028 --> 09:22.594
[sneezes]

09:22.596 --> 09:24.362
Whoa.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.231
Willie?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.699
(Willie)
'Now what?'

09:27.701 --> 09:30.368
Could you come in here
for a second?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.270
'I'm busy, ALF.'

09:32.272 --> 09:34.806
It's important.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.074
[sniffs]

09:40.247 --> 09:41.513
What is it?

09:41.515 --> 09:42.881
The pillow.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.983
It's slipping down.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.025
Okay?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.394
Needs some fluffing, too.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.504
Anything else?

10:06.506 --> 10:08.940
Well, my feet could
use some rubbing.

10:11.511 --> 10:16.147
ALF, what you have is a cold.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.482
It's not the plague.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.084
It's not malaria.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.586
It's not the Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.222
And it will run its course.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.224
Now, if you don't mind

10:26.226 --> 10:27.993
I'd like to
go back to the kitchen

10:27.995 --> 10:30.929
and finish making dinner.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.431
You're making dinner?

10:33.433 --> 10:36.901
Now I know for sure
Kate's trying to kill me.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.937
Kate is at the store

10:38.939 --> 10:41.573
filling a list of things
you requested

10:41.575 --> 10:44.743
to help ease your suffering.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.911
A small list of essentials.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.179
[door opens]

10:50.851 --> 10:52.617
Plus some reading material

10:52.619 --> 10:55.387
a few videotapes, Aspirin

10:55.389 --> 10:56.755
a hyperbaric chamber--

10:56.757 --> 10:59.190
They were out of
hyperbaric chambers.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.759
Darn!

11:00.761 --> 11:02.994
Michael Jackson must have
gotten the last one.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.100
ALF, aren't you carrying
this thing a bit far?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.535
I mean, it's been over a week.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.605
Surely, you must be
feeling better now.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.073
I'm not.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.409
If anything, I'm feeling worse.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.844
My earlobes
are starting to hurt.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.649
You know, someone
who didn't know you

11:24.651 --> 11:27.852
might think you were
just milking this.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.788
[coughing]

11:29.790 --> 11:32.691
And so might someone
who did know you.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.492
Time to take
your temperature, ALF.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.894
Oh, goody.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.328
Now, let's see if we can
keep it in your mouth

11:37.330 --> 11:39.330
a little longer this time.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.800
[sneezes]

11:41.802 --> 11:45.437
Good! You beat your
old record by three seconds.

11:45.439 --> 11:48.339
[instrumental music]

11:49.643 --> 11:51.543
Here are the books
you wanted, ALF.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.245
How are you feeling?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.781
Like someone stuffed
gerbils up my nose.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.285
You sound awful.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.853
Nice touch, ALF.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.855
Don't encourage him.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.457
Willie.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.826
But I really am
feeling worse.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.562
My cold ran its course
in a week.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.199
Isn't it interesting that
yours is hanging on so long?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.034
Look at this nose, Willie.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.136
There's enough room in there
for the viruses

12:18.138 --> 12:21.005
to start their own republic.

12:21.007 --> 12:25.577
In fact, I think I hear
their vice president speaking.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.213
[blowing nose]

12:34.988 --> 12:37.489
Feel his head, Willie.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.557
Wha.. He's not..

12:40.560 --> 12:42.026
Oh, my.. My..

12:42.028 --> 12:44.562
He, he is. He's burning up.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.065
Actually, I'm having
a cold flash right now

12:50.437 --> 12:52.203
I'm sorry, ALF.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.539
I f.. I feel terrible.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.509
Oh! I wish I felt that good.

12:57.511 --> 12:58.910
[sniffing]

12:58.912 --> 13:00.645
I'll get you some lunch.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.614
[coughing]

13:03.784 --> 13:05.216
[sniffs]

13:12.058 --> 13:14.259
I just had a horrible thought.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.095
Did you ever see that movie
"War Of The Worlds?"

13:17.097 --> 13:18.797
[grunts]
A long time ago, why?

13:18.799 --> 13:20.265
Do you remember
what happened to the aliens

13:20.267 --> 13:22.500
when they were exposed
to earth's bacteria?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.838
- You don't think..
- I don't know, Kate.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.873
I just..

13:28.875 --> 13:30.575
Don't know.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.911
[ALF sneezes]

13:32.913 --> 13:35.180
'Anybody got a spatula?'

13:36.950 --> 13:39.517
[instrumental music]

13:40.921 --> 13:43.154
[instrumental music]

13:44.224 --> 13:45.857
[coughs]

13:45.859 --> 13:47.892
[blowing nose]

13:49.429 --> 13:52.630
Oh, hello, Dr. Cramer.
This is Willie Tanner.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.266
Uh.. Well, I'm fine. Fine.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.434
'The.. I m.. I mean..'

13:56.436 --> 13:57.802
[coughs]

14:00.073 --> 14:02.473
I'm not so good, actually.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.741
Well, I.. I'm..

14:03.743 --> 14:05.643
[ALF sneezes]

14:07.080 --> 14:08.980
I'm sneezing.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.249
[ALF coughing]

14:12.485 --> 14:14.419
And I'm coughing.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.722
(ALF)
'Willie! My massage!'

14:19.059 --> 14:22.327
And I'm very demanding.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.662
Uh, well, that's
what I thought, too

14:24.664 --> 14:27.365
but it's been going on now
for such a long time

14:27.367 --> 14:30.168
that, I-I-I don't know,
is there something going around

14:30.170 --> 14:32.937
that I should know about?

14:32.939 --> 14:35.139
Oh! I see.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.009
Well, thank you, then.
Thank you very much, doctor.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.879
Alright. Goodbye.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.947
What, what did he say?

14:42.949 --> 14:45.016
He said there's
something going around.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.619
The man's a genius.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.354
I'm making ALF some soup.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.722
It's his favorite.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.857
Cream of pizza.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.328
ALF's getting worse, isn't he?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.297
Well..

14:59.299 --> 15:01.499
I think we should give him
a couple of more days.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.601
And if he doesn't show
some signs of improvement

15:03.603 --> 15:06.871
Then we're gonna have to
risk taking him to a doctor.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.039
[sneezes]

15:08.041 --> 15:12.844
[sniffs]
Kate! Willie! Everybody!

15:12.846 --> 15:15.380
Look what I found.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.948
Whoa!

15:16.950 --> 15:19.417
ALF!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.953
No.. I'm alright.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.022
Just a little woozy.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.390
[sniffs]
Look.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.392
It's a picture of Carl.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.661
Now he's delirious, Willie.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.529
That's a picture of a plant.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.699
Carl. Carl!

15:34.701 --> 15:37.702
No, Kate, Carl is the name
the Melmackians gave

15:37.704 --> 15:40.338
to the shrub that gave them
their immunity.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.841
It looked kind of like this.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.477
- Ragweed?
- Oh..

15:46.479 --> 15:50.815
I don't know, ALF, but
I don't think that will help.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.550
Oh!

15:52.552 --> 15:54.552
But it's worth a try.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.522
[instrumental music]

16:03.730 --> 16:06.130
[whispering]
Be quiet or Trevor
and Raquel will hear you.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.934
Look!

16:09.936 --> 16:12.603
[chuckles]
Do you think
it's actually possible

16:12.605 --> 16:15.139
that they're
trying to raise ragweed?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.677
[whispering]
Are you alright?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.379
- No!
- What?

16:21.381 --> 16:22.714
Shh!

16:23.783 --> 16:25.950
(Trevor)
'Who's that?'

16:25.952 --> 16:27.485
'Come on out of there!'

16:27.487 --> 16:29.587
I got a hoe!

16:34.260 --> 16:36.794
Hi, Trevor!

16:36.796 --> 16:38.796
Willie. Was that you?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.298
Yeah.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.566
It's me, alright.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.834
Hi, Trevor.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.202
Kate.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.837
We thought you guys
were a burglar.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.306
You could have been hoed.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.942
Uh.. You see, Trevor

16:50.944 --> 16:52.477
Uh..

16:52.479 --> 16:54.112
We thought we'd come over

16:54.114 --> 16:56.180
and weed your backyard.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.283
It was, uh.. Uh, yeah.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.152
Uh, we saw the other day
that you had

17:01.154 --> 17:03.121
quite a problem
with ragweed here

17:03.123 --> 17:04.789
and so, we thought,
"Why not help out?

17:04.791 --> 17:08.092
Why not just help out
old Trevor and Raquel?"

17:08.094 --> 17:09.927
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Trevor.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.230
He says they're here
to weed our garden.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.333
Oh, please.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.504
[instrumental music]

17:22.075 --> 17:23.307
Oh!

17:23.309 --> 17:24.776
Willie!

17:28.114 --> 17:29.313
What is it, ALF?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.215
Could you turn
the air conditioning up?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.284
It's like an oven in here.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.287
It's up as high
as it will go, ALF!

17:36.289 --> 17:38.256
The ragweed's almost ready, ALF.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.558
What would I want ragweed for?

17:40.560 --> 17:43.327
You asked me to bake it for you!

17:43.329 --> 17:46.931
Oh, nice. Yell at a sick alien.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.534
Oh, when is this fever
ever gonna break?

17:49.536 --> 17:50.568
- Aah!
- Aah!

17:50.570 --> 17:51.836
What? What is it?

17:51.838 --> 17:55.206
Willie! It's
the Angel of Death! Run!

17:56.743 --> 17:59.877
No, no, ALF, it's okay,
it's, it's, it's Kate.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.415
Oh! I knew it would
end like this.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.386
A virus, Kate, ragweed..

18:08.388 --> 18:09.720
...trapped in a submarine

18:09.722 --> 18:12.890
with nothing to eat
but pinto beans

18:15.228 --> 18:17.228
Stick with us, pal!

18:17.230 --> 18:20.231
After we bake it,
what do we do?

18:20.233 --> 18:24.168
Well...some of use like to
make brownies out of it

18:24.170 --> 18:26.370
and take them
to Stanley Kubrick movies.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.274
I don't think
we have time fore that.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.210
- I'll go check on the ragweed.
- Oh!

18:32.212 --> 18:33.644
Tell her to relax.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.079
Things aren't critical

18:35.081 --> 18:38.015
until I think
I'm at Tokyo Disneyland

18:38.017 --> 18:40.284
with Annette Funicello.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.588
You're gonna be okay, ALF.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.224
We'll..
We're not gonna leave you.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.226
We got the ice for the bathtub.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.627
Oh, great.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.062
I'm on my death bed

18:51.064 --> 18:54.365
you guys are having a keg party.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.334
ALF, we got you the ice
so that if your fever

18:56.336 --> 18:59.604
doesn't come down soon,
we can submerge you in it.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.205
Up to my knees I'm okay.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.740
If you get much higher,
you're gonna hear

19:02.742 --> 19:05.776
one heck of a
Little Richard impression.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.212
We're gonna put this ice
in the bathtub, just in case.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.614
- Come on, Bri.
- 'Oh!'

19:09.616 --> 19:11.616
- Get better, ALF.
- 'Oh!'

19:12.585 --> 19:14.218
Willie..

19:14.220 --> 19:15.920
Take off your roller skates.

19:15.922 --> 19:19.056
Grab a pad. Sit down.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.192
I want to talk to you
about a will, Will.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.630
I think it's only fair
to tell you..

19:25.632 --> 19:27.398
...I have a lot of debts.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.100
Oh, ALF!

19:29.102 --> 19:32.136
This isn't the time..

19:32.138 --> 19:34.839
What kind of debts?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.041
Well, it's not
on my head anymore.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.477
What do I care?

19:39.479 --> 19:42.513
Now, shall we talk
eternal sleep?

19:42.515 --> 19:45.917
I'm thinking a pyramid.
Nothing fancy.

19:45.919 --> 19:49.020
Just a simple manmade
wonder in the backyard

19:49.022 --> 19:51.189
facing the galleria.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.392
How's he doing?

19:54.394 --> 19:58.696
Oh! I loved you
in "Muscle Beach Party."

20:00.300 --> 20:01.599
What's he talking about?

20:01.601 --> 20:04.001
Oh, no! He thinks
you're Annette Funicello

20:05.505 --> 20:08.573
Well, it's a step up
from the Angel of Death.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.678
Oh! Hi, Goofy-san.

20:15.782 --> 20:19.317
This prace is gleat!

20:19.319 --> 20:21.519
Can we go on
the Small World ride?

20:21.521 --> 20:24.522
I could never
remember that song.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.657
Kate, I think we're
running out of time.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.359
- Yes!
- You bring that stuff in.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.094
We-we'll just have to
feed it to him

20:30.096 --> 20:32.230
just like it is,
and hope that it's enough.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.666
Hold on, pal!

20:35.668 --> 20:40.204
Oh, Annette, you forgot
the Chocolate Jimmies.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.841
[groans]
She must have
her ears on too tight.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.710
[groaning]

20:47.213 --> 20:50.214
[instrumental music]

20:53.653 --> 20:55.186
Where's the pesto?

20:55.188 --> 20:58.823
I can't eat chocolate
turkey without pesto.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.258
You put the last of the pesto

21:00.260 --> 21:03.527
in your chocolate
ragweed, remember?

21:03.529 --> 21:05.429
Don't remind me.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.165
Getting that cold was
the most humiliating experience

21:08.167 --> 21:09.700
of my life.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.236
Made me feel almost..

21:12.238 --> 21:14.171
...human.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.774
A grizzly fate.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.410
- At least you're better now.
- Yeah.

21:19.412 --> 21:24.248
And the upside is, I've decided
to market my ragweed cold cure.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.983
You know, like Amway?

21:25.985 --> 21:29.487
Only, I'll call
my company Chumway.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.422
You'll be my first
employee, Willie.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.558
You'll love the dental plan!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.927
Ragweed won't work
on Earth people.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.930
In fact, ragweed
makes many of us sick.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.066
Oh. You're fired.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.438
[instrumental music]

21:48.541 --> 21:49.974
Alright.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.077
You take the coleslaw.
I'll take the salad.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.680
Today, we finally get to use
our backyard Blitzer.

21:58.251 --> 22:00.384
I got the barbecue lit.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.386
Specifically, the wheels.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.722
[coughing]

22:04.724 --> 22:07.692
[instrumental music]

22:12.598 --> 22:15.599
[theme music]

22:39.992 --> 22:42.693
[laughing]
