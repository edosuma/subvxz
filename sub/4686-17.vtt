Rachel. Rachel.

00:03.322 --> 00:04.562
Rachel, come on.

00:04.589 --> 00:06.223
Rachel.

00:06.258 --> 00:08.793
(echoing):
Come on. You're on.

00:08.827 --> 00:11.429
(applause)

00:13.298 --> 00:15.800
Here's your c-c-costume, Rachel.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.269
Steak a dreg.

00:18.303 --> 00:19.670
There's nothing on the hanger.

00:19.705 --> 00:21.806
Yes, well, apparently
the emperor wears no clothes.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.240
(gasps)

00:28.180 --> 00:30.881
Little trouble
chewing on something?

00:30.916 --> 00:33.250
Love me.
I love you.

00:33.285 --> 00:34.952
Why can't you love me back?

00:34.987 --> 00:36.754
Hey, Rache.

00:36.788 --> 00:39.924
(very high-pitched):
It's all riding on you, kid.

00:39.958 --> 00:42.393
(distorted, deep): Even though you
have no business being up there,

00:42.427 --> 00:43.561
shouldn't you be onstage?

00:43.595 --> 00:44.862
Where's my purse?

00:44.896 --> 00:46.797
Or my Finn necklace.
Where's my Finn necklace?

00:46.832 --> 00:48.799

KURT: I don't know why
you're so anxious.

02:48.386 --> 02:50.354
You killed it
in the previews up in Syracuse.

02:50.388 --> 02:52.756
- RACHEL: No, you didn't read any of the reviews.
- Yes, I did, I read every

02:52.791 --> 02:54.325
- single one of them.
- No, you only read the legit ones.

02:54.359 --> 02:55.626
You did not read the
independent bloggers

02:55.660 --> 02:56.961
or you didn't read
the comments sections.

02:56.995 --> 02:58.596
I told you to stay out
of that comments section.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.564
I know, but I couldn't help it,
and now it's like

03:00.599 --> 03:02.566
they're my anxiety avatars.
Like the people in my dream.

03:02.601 --> 03:04.001
They're the voices
of all the self-doubt

03:04.035 --> 03:05.736
that I've ever had
about myself. And, you know,

03:05.770 --> 03:07.705
why do people become actors
in the first place?

03:07.739 --> 03:09.673
You know? It's because
we want to be loved.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.408
We're like a...
like a bottomless cup

03:11.443 --> 03:13.944
that just constantly needs to be
filled with love and validation.

03:13.979 --> 03:15.946
Give me your phone.

03:19.649 --> 03:22.129
You're being unplugged until
after your opening night.

03:22.154 --> 03:24.855
- Wait...
- No going on the Internet for anything.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.190
All the greats do it.

03:26.224 --> 03:28.592
Scorsese, Woody, Miley.

03:28.627 --> 03:31.195
None of them read reviews
or blogs

03:31.229 --> 03:32.830
or check Twitter. Okay?

03:32.864 --> 03:34.698
We are going to
hermetically seal this loft

03:34.733 --> 03:37.835
into a big love bubble and fill
it with positive affirmations

03:37.869 --> 03:40.638
and validations from
people who know you

03:40.672 --> 03:42.540
and love you and have no doubt

03:42.574 --> 03:44.141
that you're going
to be amazing.

03:44.176 --> 03:47.144
If you need your cup filled,
we'll fill it right here.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.481
Okay.

03:54.019 --> 03:56.086
Thank you.

03:56.121 --> 03:58.856
(school bell rings)
Hey, William.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.191
How's your day going, huh?

04:00.225 --> 04:01.665
Honestly, it's been
a little rough...

04:01.693 --> 04:02.827
Yeah, I don't care.

04:02.861 --> 04:04.228
Listen, it's come
to my attention you have

04:04.262 --> 04:06.063
an extra plane ticket
to New York City.

04:06.097 --> 04:07.464
That's right, yeah.

04:07.499 --> 04:09.500
I'm going in for Rachel's
opening. (clears throat)

04:09.534 --> 04:11.802
Yeah, uh, Emma and I booked it
months ago, but she's obviously

04:11.837 --> 04:14.738
too pregnant to fly right now,
and Coach Beiste said that, uh,

04:14.773 --> 04:17.141
Southwest wouldn't let her fly
because she takes up two seats.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.509
Well, I'll take the ticket.

04:18.543 --> 04:20.344
I have to see New York.

04:20.378 --> 04:21.779
What are you talking about?

04:21.813 --> 04:23.347
You hate New York.

04:23.381 --> 04:27.451
Western Ohio, there's a scab
on the face of America.

04:27.486 --> 04:29.119
It's an island.

04:29.154 --> 04:31.789
It's shaped like a dong
and smells like hot pee.

04:31.823 --> 04:34.625
This island is called
New York City,

04:34.659 --> 04:37.461
and it's high time
the real America

04:37.496 --> 04:40.498
told New York to take a hike.

04:40.532 --> 04:45.302
New York is a loud, overcrowded
cesspool of ten million people

04:45.337 --> 04:47.705
and 70 million rats,

04:47.739 --> 04:50.808
where the best one can expect
after a Central Park wilding

04:50.842 --> 04:53.244
at one of the city's hundreds
of ethnic day parades

04:53.278 --> 04:56.013
is a soggy, pork
anus frankfurter

04:56.047 --> 04:57.648
that a cockroach walked across.

04:57.682 --> 05:00.651
New York is not just the playpen
of the mega-rich Honey?

05:00.685 --> 05:02.620
Billionaires who
crushed and snorted

05:02.654 --> 05:04.321
our nation's
retirement savings...

05:04.356 --> 05:07.858
it's also the home of Broadway.

05:07.893 --> 05:10.995
That great American institution
that bores us to death

05:11.029 --> 05:13.764
one night a year with that
bi-curious minstrel show

05:13.798 --> 05:17.268
of self-congratulation:
the Tony Awards.

05:17.302 --> 05:21.505
That broadcast lit up the
switchboards with thousands

05:21.540 --> 05:25.142
of angry callers, and the
network brass did their research

05:25.177 --> 05:28.179
and they discovered I've
never been to New York City.

05:28.213 --> 05:30.047
- What?
- You see, I've been taking my cue from

05:30.081 --> 05:32.216
cable news lately,
just lying a lot.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.517
But now I need to actually

05:33.552 --> 05:36.787
visit that hellhole
and see how soulless,

05:36.822 --> 05:39.056
empty and bullet-ridden
it really is.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.724
- Well...
- Or I'll lose my credibility.

05:40.759 --> 05:43.928
Okay. Fine, the ticket
is yours if you want it.

05:43.962 --> 05:46.163
But you have to
pay me back for it.

05:46.198 --> 05:47.865
And you have to come with me

05:47.899 --> 05:49.233
to the opening night
of Rachel's show.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.801
I mean it, Sue.

05:50.836 --> 05:52.469
No excuses.

05:52.504 --> 05:54.972
You drive a hard bargain,
Butt Chin.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.307
I'll do it.

05:56.341 --> 05:58.976
Great. Actually looking forward
to it. (short laugh)

06:02.013 --> 06:05.216
New York City. Huh.

06:06.751 --> 06:08.719
What's that gonna be like?

- TINA: Hello, big fat Broadway star.
- Hey.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.759
- Hi.
- About time.

08:28.793 --> 08:30.494
These are for you.

08:30.528 --> 08:32.162
(mouthing words)

08:32.197 --> 08:33.330
Oh, no. Do you
have laryngitis?

08:33.365 --> 08:35.232
Oh, no, she's just
resting her voice.

08:35.267 --> 08:37.268
Oh, thank God. This
would not be a good time

08:37.302 --> 08:39.602
for your tonsils to flare up again.
Remember that?

08:39.638 --> 08:41.438
First year of
Glee Club? (laughs)

08:41.472 --> 08:43.207
Hey, where is everyone?

08:43.241 --> 08:47.077
Rachel's opening night
on Broadway is a big deal.

08:47.112 --> 08:49.380
And where's Artie?
I was hoping to get to see him.

08:49.414 --> 08:50.948
Oh, his short film
<i>Bags in the Wind</i>

08:50.982 --> 08:52.216
got accepted
into the Ft. Lauderdale

08:52.250 --> 08:53.484
International
Short Film Festival.

08:53.518 --> 08:55.286
Oh, that's too
bad. I mean,

08:55.320 --> 08:57.121
what about Quinn and
Puck and Santana?

08:57.155 --> 08:58.835
I mean, are they
just not being supportive?

08:58.857 --> 09:00.724
Tina! Why don't you catch us up?

09:00.759 --> 09:02.593
How's Brown University
treating you? Mm.

09:02.627 --> 09:04.595
Ah, I love everything about it.

09:04.629 --> 09:07.431
Except for my dorm room.
My roommate...

09:07.465 --> 09:09.867
she's nice... but she's from
Pakistan and she speaks

09:09.901 --> 09:11.981
almost no English
and she's always watching

09:12.003 --> 09:13.504
that Al Jazeera channel.

09:13.538 --> 09:15.172
And, no, I don't
have a boyfriend,

09:15.206 --> 09:16.840
but I was dating
this really nice guy,

09:16.875 --> 09:18.108
but he turned out to be...

09:18.143 --> 09:19.076
Gay. Gay. Gay.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.679
- Proud homosexual.
- No.

09:21.713 --> 09:23.180
Yes.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.415
- Anyway...
- Knew it.

09:24.449 --> 09:26.116
Rachel, I read this amazing

09:26.151 --> 09:28.018
story about you on
BroadwayWorld.com,

09:28.053 --> 09:30.120
and they are predicting
that <i> Funny Girl</i> is gonna be

09:30.155 --> 09:31.655
a huge hit. And so
is everybody else,

09:31.690 --> 09:33.490
- except for a few moronic bloggers.
- BLAINE: Oh, hey, Tina.

09:33.525 --> 09:36.193
- But, I mean, who are they to call you
pitchy? - Let's go get an iced mocha.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.429
And do not get me started on
those anonymous comment trolls.

09:38.463 --> 09:39.563
I mean, that...
You are not that short.

09:39.597 --> 09:41.277
ALL:
Shut up.

09:45.770 --> 09:48.973
It's fine.

(applause)

22:19.039 --> 22:20.339
Excuse me, sir.

22:20.374 --> 22:22.208
Could you call me a taxicab?

22:22.242 --> 22:24.477
First time in New York?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.279
And what makes you think that?

22:26.313 --> 22:28.347
Well, that is not
how you call a cab.

22:28.382 --> 22:30.782
All you have to do is walk out
on the curb and put your hand

22:30.784 --> 22:33.753
- in the air.
- Oh, okay. I see. I didn't... I didn't know.

22:33.787 --> 22:34.854
Don't feel bad.

22:34.888 --> 22:36.822
You know, that was
my first Broadway show.

22:36.857 --> 22:39.592
Yeah. One of my patrons
gave me the tickets.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.986
I didn't think it was gonna
make me want to barf so much.

22:42.132 --> 22:44.172
I mean, it's called <i> Funny Girl.</i>
I thought

22:44.197 --> 22:45.558
it was gonna be
about a funny girl.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.466
- Right?
- Yeah.(chuckles)

22:47.501 --> 22:50.569
- It definitely was not funny,
and for a second there...
- No.

22:50.604 --> 22:52.705
I wasn't even sure
she was a girl.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.107
You said "patron."
Are you a sex worker?

22:55.142 --> 22:58.377
(chuckles)
No. I am a restaurateur.

22:58.412 --> 23:01.547
Oh. I own a few places
around the city.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.115
Yeah. I'm kind of a big deal.

23:03.150 --> 23:04.483
Wow.

23:04.518 --> 23:05.885
You want to grab a bite?

23:06.920 --> 23:09.322
Yeah.

23:09.356 --> 23:10.723
Hey!

23:10.757 --> 23:12.858
You're doing great
up there. You're giving it

23:12.893 --> 23:14.694
- the full Fanny.
- Hey, how you feeling?

23:14.728 --> 23:16.729
I don't know. I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.083
I mean, good, good. But do
you guys think that, you know,

23:19.099 --> 23:21.200
Sue getting up in the middle
had any sort of effect

23:21.234 --> 23:23.369
on the critics or the audience
or anything like that?

23:23.403 --> 23:25.037
- No.
- No, no, probably not.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.206
No, right?

23:31.244 --> 23:32.678
Bravo.

23:32.713 --> 23:34.413
- You were terrific in the first act.
- Oh, good, good, good.

23:34.448 --> 23:35.815
- Terrific.
- I made some little changes, but...

23:35.849 --> 23:38.417
- No, no. It was wonderful. I promise you...
- Great.

23:38.452 --> 23:39.919
- It was wonderful.
- Okay.

23:39.953 --> 23:42.655
I'm a little concerned
about that guy in the...

23:42.689 --> 23:45.157
the tracksuit leaving
right at the beginning.

23:45.192 --> 23:47.493
I mean, he stepped
over the critic of the <i> Times.</i>

23:47.527 --> 23:48.527
The guy was spooked.

23:48.562 --> 23:50.029
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:50.063 --> 23:52.932
Not to worry, not to worry.

23:52.966 --> 23:55.601
The important thing now

23:55.636 --> 23:57.970
is what you do in act two.

23:58.005 --> 24:01.274
Critics remember
beginnings and endings.

24:01.308 --> 24:02.575
So now you have to dig deep.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.277
I know you can do it.

24:04.311 --> 24:06.212
All you have to do is share it
with everybody.

24:06.246 --> 24:07.847
I can do it.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.116
Sorry to tell you,
you're gonna have to.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.784
With all the work
that we've done,

24:11.818 --> 24:13.052
all the money that's been

24:13.086 --> 24:14.453
put in,

24:14.488 --> 24:16.255
it's all for that one critic
from the <i> Times.</i>

24:16.290 --> 24:18.791
If he doesn't like it...

24:18.825 --> 24:20.192
we're kaput.

24:20.227 --> 24:24.030
If the review is bad, then
opening night is closing night.

24:24.064 --> 24:26.232
And that...

24:26.266 --> 24:28.267
is showbiz.

24:39.256 --> 24:41.873
I mean, seriously,
if I wanted to see a show

24:41.898 --> 24:43.299
about an ugly duckling
who gets dumped,

24:43.333 --> 24:44.800
I'd just watch an episode
of <i> Girls.</i>

24:44.835 --> 24:46.269
I hear you.

24:46.303 --> 24:48.037
So welcome to Mario's,
Sue Sylvester,

24:48.071 --> 24:50.039
the gem of Little Italy.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.375
I know it's changed from
when I was growing up.

24:52.409 --> 24:54.744
Now it's pretty much one street
surrounded by Chinatown.

24:54.778 --> 24:56.279
But, still, it's pretty special.

24:56.313 --> 24:58.281
Well, I do like the idea
of naming a restaurant

24:58.315 --> 25:00.483
after one's self.
(chuckles)

25:00.517 --> 25:03.286
Hey, Salvatore.
This is Sue Sylvester.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.620
I'm gonna go whip
up something...

25:04.655 --> 25:06.289
<i>Buonasera,</i> Signorina Sylvester.

25:06.323 --> 25:09.625
This is America.
We speak English here.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.761
So,

25:11.795 --> 25:13.562
what can I make for you?

25:13.597 --> 25:16.832
How about some gnocchi
alla napolitano?

25:16.867 --> 25:19.201
Or, uh, linguine al pesto?

25:19.236 --> 25:21.470
I'm not sure.

25:21.505 --> 25:24.373
And, to tell you the truth, no
one's ever cooked for me before.

25:24.408 --> 25:26.309
What? You got to be kidding.

25:26.343 --> 25:29.011
No. It's true. My parents
were famous Nazi hunters,

25:29.046 --> 25:30.479
so they weren't around a lot.

25:30.514 --> 25:33.382
Also, I've been threatened
with poisonings several times,

25:33.417 --> 25:35.251
so I don't even order takeout
without my food taster,

25:35.285 --> 25:36.686
and Becky's back in Ohio.

25:36.720 --> 25:40.289
(sizzling)
All right, I got to ask.

25:40.324 --> 25:42.692
Married?

25:43.727 --> 25:45.361
I'm divorced, actually.

25:45.395 --> 25:47.163
Um, I was briefly married
to myself,

25:47.197 --> 25:48.631
uh, but it didn't work out.

25:48.665 --> 25:51.834
We both realized in the
end that we'd grown apart.

25:51.868 --> 25:53.703
Huh.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.006
You?

25:58.041 --> 26:00.810
No, I'm, uh, married to my city.

26:00.844 --> 26:03.012
This town is my mistress.

26:03.046 --> 26:04.981
She's my type of gal.

26:06.016 --> 26:07.650
Cruel, delicious

26:07.684 --> 26:09.852
and 100 stories tall.

26:14.024 --> 26:15.992
- There you go.
- Oh.

26:16.026 --> 26:18.661
- <i>Buon appetito.</i>
- Mmm.

26:18.695 --> 26:20.062
(inhales deeply)

26:20.097 --> 26:21.197
(sighs)

26:21.231 --> 26:22.865
I have to say,

26:22.899 --> 26:25.067
when I decided
to come to New York,

26:25.102 --> 26:28.004
I did not think this
was going to happen.

26:28.038 --> 26:29.338
(both chuckle)

26:29.373 --> 26:30.940
(speaks Italian) Oh.

26:30.974 --> 26:33.943
Oh. I knew that <i> Funny Girl</i>
would be a disaster.

26:33.977 --> 26:36.812
I've seen Rachel Berry butcher
literally dozens of show tunes

26:36.847 --> 26:39.348
with many an ugly cry, but...

26:39.383 --> 26:44.086
I did not predict that I would
meet somebody like you.

26:44.121 --> 26:45.354
Me, neither.

26:45.389 --> 26:47.957
Although there aren't
a lot of women like you.

26:49.226 --> 26:52.194
You know, that show
would've been a lot better

26:52.229 --> 26:54.149
if you'd been up there
on that stage.

- Thank you.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.476
I bawled during "Who Are You Now?".

29:47.479 --> 29:49.445
I had to blow my nose on Sam's sleeve.

29:49.479 --> 29:50.446
This is suede.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.514
I'm sorry. You guys,

29:51.548 --> 29:52.869
I love you so much.
I seriously...

29:52.883 --> 29:54.383
I couldn't have done this
without all of you.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.138
KURT: And you got flowers
from Quinn I know.

29:56.153 --> 29:58.721
And Artie and Mike Chang
and Puck and Principal Figgins.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.590
Clearly you're loved by many.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.325
(laughing)

30:03.493 --> 30:05.094
Whoa...
(whooping)

30:05.095 --> 30:06.329
Tonight,

30:06.363 --> 30:08.197
you are a star.

(cheering)
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.002
You know what, you guys,
let's save all the praises

30:13.036 --> 30:15.071
- until after the <i> New York Times
</i> review comes out. - Yeah, yeah.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.472
- You're right, you're right.
- Yeah.

30:16.506 --> 30:18.140
We have, uh, six hours
of innocence left.

30:18.175 --> 30:21.310
- Whew. - And then when the reviews
hit the stand, we'll find out

30:21.345 --> 30:25.114
if we're the best thing
since sliced bread or toast.

30:25.148 --> 30:26.115
But...

30:26.149 --> 30:27.583
we are going

30:27.618 --> 30:29.151
- to celebrate tonight.
- Okay.

30:29.186 --> 30:32.021
We are going to have
an opening night party,

30:32.055 --> 30:34.490
Elio's restaurant,
Italian restaurant.

30:34.524 --> 30:36.726

30:49.506 --> 30:51.874
I can't believe it,
a real Broadway cast party.

30:51.909 --> 30:54.710
I don't really feel
like going to the party.

30:54.745 --> 30:56.279
I think that they're just gonna

30:56.313 --> 30:57.613
only be talking about the play,

30:57.648 --> 30:59.115
and... I don't know...
I'd rather just...

30:59.149 --> 31:00.449
celebrate with you guys.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.550
BLAINE:
I know just the place

31:01.585 --> 31:02.551
down in Greenwich Village.

31:02.586 --> 31:03.452
Trust me, Rachel,

31:03.487 --> 31:04.887
they're gonna love you there.

31:04.922 --> 31:07.023
(booming dance music playing)

31:13.130 --> 31:15.298
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.632
Oh, my God.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.935
Rachel Berry?!
Here?!

31:18.969 --> 31:21.270
Oh, my God, you recognize me?

31:21.305 --> 31:24.207
(music stops) We've been
tracking <i> Funny Girl</i> for weeks.

31:24.241 --> 31:25.074
How was tonight?

31:25.108 --> 31:26.209
She was incredible.

31:26.243 --> 31:27.610
Oh, well, then
this is historic.

31:27.644 --> 31:30.046
You have to sing something...
it's Broadway tradition.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.248
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm not sure.
- Whatever the review

31:32.282 --> 31:34.717
says tomorrow, let's just love
and celebrate you tonight,

31:34.751 --> 31:35.952
right now.

31:35.986 --> 31:38.087
Well, in that case...

31:38.121 --> 31:40.041
- I'm here for the night!
- (cheering)

31:40.057 --> 31:41.157
Hit it!

31:41.191 --> 31:43.392

Who wants to rub my feet?

33:59.496 --> 34:02.265
I haven't danced that hard
since Nationals two years ago.

34:02.299 --> 34:04.100
I got the DJ's number.

34:04.134 --> 34:06.302
Oh. Tina, I told you,
he's totally gay.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.537
- Come on.
- Gay?

34:07.571 --> 34:09.472
- TINA: No!
- BLAINE: What are you, blind? Tina!

34:09.505 --> 34:10.907
Uh, I'm gonna make

34:10.940 --> 34:13.376
some coffee, you guys. The
reviews come out in 30 minutes,

34:13.409 --> 34:16.045
and I want us all to go down
to the newsstand together.

34:16.079 --> 34:18.781
Uh, I'll take mine black,
thanks.

34:18.815 --> 34:20.382
(sighs)

34:22.619 --> 34:24.320
Who are all you people?

34:24.353 --> 34:26.222
Oh, my God.

34:26.255 --> 34:27.523
You are the guy... the guy

34:27.558 --> 34:29.225
that walked out
of my show last night.

34:29.259 --> 34:30.620
What are you doing
in my apartment?

34:30.627 --> 34:31.661
In my robe?

34:31.695 --> 34:32.862
Well, aren't you all

34:32.896 --> 34:35.031
so very, very rude.

34:35.065 --> 34:38.301
Oh, my God,
Sue had sex in your bed.

34:39.235 --> 34:40.636
(sniffles)

34:40.670 --> 34:42.938
Actually, we did it
all over your apartment.

34:42.973 --> 34:45.842
And if I were you, I'd put
something down on that couch

34:45.876 --> 34:46.809
before I sat on it.

34:46.844 --> 34:47.677
Oh, no, no.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.811
No, no, no, no.

34:48.846 --> 34:50.112
So, how'd the rest

34:50.147 --> 34:51.514
of the show go, huh?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.081
I considered coming back
for act two

34:53.116 --> 34:54.583
just so I could walk out again.

34:54.618 --> 34:56.686
Okay, you know what? I am not...

34:56.719 --> 35:00.341
It's okay. I got this.

35:00.376 --> 35:04.345
You made my life in high school
a living hell.

35:04.380 --> 35:05.513
Well, thank you.

35:05.548 --> 35:06.748
And it's like you had a mission

35:06.749 --> 35:08.450
to keep us underwater,

35:08.484 --> 35:10.785
never coming up,
even for a breath

35:10.820 --> 35:13.621
of air, and you said
that it was to push us,

35:13.656 --> 35:15.857
but I really don't think
that's what you wanted,

35:15.891 --> 35:18.026
because if we actually felt

35:18.060 --> 35:21.729
how wonderful and amazing
and loved we really were,

35:21.764 --> 35:23.965
then we would know
what you knew all along,

35:23.999 --> 35:27.335
which is that you are
a rotten and awful person

35:27.369 --> 35:29.704
who only finds joy
in people's misery.

35:29.738 --> 35:31.072
Well, let me
tell you something.

35:31.107 --> 35:32.474
Something amazing
happened tonight.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.109
A group of friends
rallied together

35:34.143 --> 35:35.577
and made a dream come true.

35:35.611 --> 35:39.047
And never, ever in your empty,
sad life will you feel

35:39.081 --> 35:41.182
the kind of love
that I felt tonight.

35:41.217 --> 35:42.283
And I would feel

35:42.318 --> 35:44.252
so sad for you, but I don't,

35:44.286 --> 35:46.921
because I just want you to get
the hell out of my apartment,

35:46.956 --> 35:48.876
because I want to be
with my friends.

35:51.527 --> 35:53.228
Wow.

35:53.262 --> 35:55.630
Oh, Mario, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

35:55.664 --> 35:57.398
Let's go.

35:59.034 --> 36:02.537
I suddenly don't feel
very welcome here anymore.

36:05.975 --> 36:07.942
(sighs)

36:07.977 --> 36:10.879
Well, it was, uh, super
meeting all of you.

36:11.847 --> 36:13.281
Hey, where'd you get this robe?

36:13.315 --> 36:16.518
- Just keep it.
- Thanks, bro.

36:19.853 --> 36:22.333
MERCEDES:
Ah, Rachel.

36:22.358 --> 36:23.658
Bravo.

36:23.692 --> 36:26.361
BLAINE:
Rachel. Rachel!

36:26.395 --> 36:27.996
- Rachel! Rachel!
- Yeah.

36:28.030 --> 36:30.098
Poetry... couldn't

36:30.132 --> 36:33.733
have said it better myself.
(applause, whooping)

36:35.622 --> 36:38.223
(sirens blaring)

36:38.258 --> 36:40.326
Sir, do you have
the <i> New York Times?</i>

36:40.360 --> 36:42.728
- It's the paper of record.
- How old are you?

36:42.762 --> 36:45.764
They're gonna e-mail you the <i> New</i>
<i>York Times</i> in three minutes.

36:45.799 --> 36:48.067
- What the heck?
- Just give us the paper.

36:48.101 --> 36:50.235
Oh, my God.

36:50.270 --> 36:52.304
SANTANA:
Open it.

36:52.339 --> 36:53.739
Come on.

36:53.773 --> 36:55.074
Open it!

36:55.108 --> 36:56.375
Open... I'm cold!

36:56.409 --> 36:57.543
Can you open it?

36:57.577 --> 36:58.911
Rachel, let's go,
let's read it.

36:58.945 --> 37:00.585
No, I can't, I can't.
I can't do it, Kurt.

37:00.613 --> 37:01.981
- You're gonna have to read it.
- No way!

37:02.015 --> 37:03.515
- I'm too nervous. - You know what?
Give me this.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.584
I don't mind being
the bearer of bad news.

37:05.618 --> 37:08.120
- All right.
- SANTANA: Okay.

37:08.154 --> 37:09.521
"One might ask themselves, why?

37:09.556 --> 37:10.789
"Why revive <i> Funny Girl?</i>

37:10.824 --> 37:12.925
"An iconic show
with an iconic star.

"Why, when there are so many
wonderful new playwrights,

I can only come up with

a single answer,
and it's Rachel Berry."

"But she also has
something else in spades...

- talent."
- Oh, my God.

37:37.217 --> 37:39.051
- SAM: Talent!
- Talent. "And mountains of it.

37:39.085 --> 37:40.552
"I'm not talking
about the Appalachians.

Oh, my God.

- Okay.
- All right.

38:21.227 --> 38:22.361
(whooping) Yes! (phone ringing)

38:22.395 --> 38:23.696
My phone is ringing.

38:23.730 --> 38:24.863
Who's call...?

38:24.898 --> 38:26.332
Oh, it's Mr. Shue!
Oh, hey.

38:26.366 --> 38:28.667
Oh, wait. Mr. Shue,
I'm putting you on speaker!

38:28.702 --> 38:32.338
I made it back just in time
for the last few pushes.

38:32.372 --> 38:35.474
Emma's doing fine,
and so is the baby.

38:35.508 --> 38:36.642
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Yay!

38:36.676 --> 38:38.410
Shut up and just tell us
what we need to know.

38:38.445 --> 38:39.578
Boy or girl?

38:39.613 --> 38:40.746
It's a boy.

38:40.780 --> 38:42.214
(cheering
and overlapping chatter)

38:42.248 --> 38:43.716
It's a boy.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.517
Yeah, we're naming him Daniel.

38:45.552 --> 38:47.119
Daniel Finn Schuester.

38:47.153 --> 38:48.320
Aw.

38:50.590 --> 38:53.225
Hey, hey, how was...
how was the show?

38:53.259 --> 38:55.694
It was amazing.
How do you feel?

38:55.729 --> 38:57.896
(laughing)

38:57.931 --> 39:01.367
Oh, for the first time
in my life, I feel...

39:01.401 --> 39:03.369
completely happy.

39:05.071 --> 39:07.206
How about you?

39:07.240 --> 39:09.208
Same. I feel the exact same.

39:09.242 --> 39:10.809
So, I got to run.

39:10.844 --> 39:11.977
Okay, well, we love you.

39:12.012 --> 39:13.212
(overlapping chatter) ALL: Bye.

39:13.246 --> 39:14.813
Bye. Love you,
Mr. Shue.

39:14.848 --> 39:16.815
(siren blaring)

39:16.850 --> 39:19.585
So... what now?

39:19.619 --> 39:21.587
Well, it's morning.

39:21.621 --> 39:23.822
I have an early
flight to catch.

39:25.925 --> 39:29.395
Hey, I, uh... I don't
suppose I could convince you

39:29.429 --> 39:32.264
to stay in New York
a little longer.

39:32.299 --> 39:34.300
Um...

39:34.334 --> 39:37.036
No. I have a school
to run and a daughter

39:37.070 --> 39:39.505
that needs me, whose
father is Michael Bolton.

39:39.539 --> 39:41.674
Wait. What?

39:41.708 --> 39:44.610
Last night was
truly magical. I...

39:44.644 --> 39:47.212
Oh, turns out I love New York,

39:47.247 --> 39:50.082
and you are the reason why.

39:50.116 --> 39:53.052
But, Mario,
I'm a Lima gal at heart.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.688
I, uh... I love
living in a place

39:55.722 --> 39:58.891
where "Hang On, Sloopy"
is the official state song.

39:58.925 --> 40:01.994
Where the Y Bridge in Zanesville
spans the confluence

40:02.028 --> 40:04.630
of the Muskingum and
Licking Rivers, making it

40:04.664 --> 40:06.699
the only bridge in the world
that you can cross

40:06.733 --> 40:08.901
and still be
on the same side of the river.

40:08.935 --> 40:10.536
I love living in a place

40:10.570 --> 40:12.871
that is home
to the world's largest basket,

40:12.906 --> 40:16.208
located in Basket Village, USA.

40:16.243 --> 40:18.877
I guess what I'm saying, Mario,

40:18.912 --> 40:22.348
is, um, Sue Sylvester's
a big fish

40:22.382 --> 40:26.252
who really kind of likes
swimming in a little pond.

40:26.286 --> 40:28.487
I don't suppose

40:28.521 --> 40:31.690
I could convince <i> you</i>
to, uh, pull up stakes and...

40:31.725 --> 40:33.092
(sighs)

40:33.126 --> 40:36.895
Uh, you know, I'm
a New Yorker, Sue.

40:38.765 --> 40:42.234
So, uh, I guess that's it, huh?

40:42.269 --> 40:44.603
I guess so.

40:44.638 --> 40:48.908
It sure was nice getting
to know you, Sue Sylvester.

41:00.086 --> 41:02.087
(sighs)

41:04.424 --> 41:05.591
(whistles)

41:05.625 --> 41:07.326
(sighs) Yeah.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.562
So long, Sue.

41:10.597 --> 41:13.198
(sighing):
Ah.

41:13.233 --> 41:14.433
Where to, lady?

41:14.467 --> 41:17.069
Huh? I take.

41:17.103 --> 41:19.004
Ah, ah, ah.
I...

41:19.039 --> 41:21.040
Cra... crazy!

41:22.812 --> 41:24.052
Drive the car.

41:24.077 --> 41:25.210
Crazy lady.

41:25.245 --> 41:27.246
I got it. I got it.

41:29.115 --> 41:31.116
(sighs)

41:33.853 --> 41:36.255
(sighs)

41:36.289 --> 41:38.991
Thanks for making
me feel like a girl.

41:40.594 --> 41:42.161
She wasn't right...

41:42.195 --> 41:44.296
the short girl from the play.

41:44.331 --> 41:46.298
You are lovable, Sue.

41:51.338 --> 41:53.339
Let's get out of here.

41:59.512 --> 42:02.147
Recently, I've gotten
in a lot of hot water

42:02.182 --> 42:05.251
for some comments
I made on this broadcast.

42:05.285 --> 42:07.853
Last week, I called
New York City an overpriced,

42:07.888 --> 42:10.556
rat-infested hellhole that
smells like an adult diaper.

42:10.590 --> 42:12.691
Well, let me be clear.

42:12.726 --> 42:14.994
I stand by my comments.

42:15.028 --> 42:18.697
Every word I said...
absolutely true.

42:18.732 --> 42:21.133
Except for one thing.

42:21.167 --> 42:23.669
I don't hate New York.

42:23.703 --> 42:26.872
I love... New York.

42:26.907 --> 42:30.442
There's nowhere on
earth quite like it.

42:30.477 --> 42:34.613
There's no place so alive with
endless worlds of possibility.

42:34.648 --> 42:36.081
Every time you step outside,

42:36.116 --> 42:37.816
you find yourself
on an adventure

42:37.851 --> 42:39.184
you never could have predicted.

42:39.219 --> 42:41.987
Sure, you might get hit by a bus
or stop for pierogies

42:42.022 --> 42:44.623
and end up being human
trafficked by the Russian Mob,

42:44.658 --> 42:49.128
but if you're anything like this
champion cheerleading coach,

42:49.162 --> 42:52.865
you just might also find love.

42:54.134 --> 42:56.235
Or, at the very least,

42:56.269 --> 42:59.038
a night of sturdy,
spirited lovemaking

42:59.072 --> 43:01.640
with a relative stranger
in every corner of the apartment

43:01.675 --> 43:03.209
of several
of your former students.

43:03.243 --> 43:04.610
(clicks her tongue)

43:04.644 --> 43:09.027
And that's how
Sue... sees it.
