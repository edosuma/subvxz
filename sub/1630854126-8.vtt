WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:04.221
This is where our winter
vegetables will be growing.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.570
But we'll also have
tomatoes there next year.

00:05.570 --> 00:06.832
And, Barbara, I don't
want to get into it.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.269
This is not the dirt
I was promised.

00:08.269 --> 00:10.184
Barbara, you said you had
a good story for me.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.315
Ooh.

00:12.403 --> 00:15.058
What is that?

00:15.058 --> 00:16.233
Ugh.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.756
Oh, my God.

00:17.756 --> 00:18.931
A bone?

00:18.931 --> 00:20.498
From a person?

00:20.498 --> 00:21.499
Nope.

00:21.499 --> 00:22.587
Ohh.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.241
Have mercy.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.374
Got 'em.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.942
Wait.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.944
Was this the one I buried?

00:31.944 --> 00:33.424
Oh.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.383
It's a beef rib.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.732
Got 'em.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.996
Stay out of my garden.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.148
So, this is our midterm
development meeting

01:01.148 --> 01:03.759
where we explore benchmarks for
the second half of the year.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.456
We love these.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.110
They remind you that
even though it feels

01:07.110 --> 01:09.025
like it's almost time
for summer break,

01:09.025 --> 01:11.462
the school year
isn't even close to over.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.508
So that's the school district's
requirements.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.597
Now, hurry up and talk
about your individual
goals or whatever.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.642
This is cutting into
my pre-happy hour hour.

01:17.642 --> 01:18.991
Uh, I have an entire week

01:18.991 --> 01:20.689
dedicate to
the historical terrors

01:20.689 --> 01:22.778
of Thanksgiving
for the indigenous people,

01:22.778 --> 01:24.780
followed by a screening
of the seminal film--

01:24.780 --> 01:26.521
"Soul Food"?
You know it.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.349
♪ Mama ♪ Mama

01:28.349 --> 01:30.046
Well, I love the holidays,

01:30.046 --> 01:31.874
and this year Barbara Howard's
Little Helpers

01:31.874 --> 01:35.138
will be making the most adorable
handprint Christmas trees.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.880
And my kids will be doing
hand turkey art,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.622
and I'll be recycling it
to soak up all the snow

01:40.622 --> 01:42.319
that gets through
the cracks in the windows.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.973
Children's hands really seem
to carry the holidays.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.453
Yeah, they do.
It's crazy.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.019
Uh, my eighth grade students
and I will need the gym

01:47.019 --> 01:49.065
and a safety ladder
next week.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.284
For a dunk contest?

01:50.284 --> 01:51.894
No.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.287
We'll be doing
the egg drop.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.984
Appreciate it if everyone
can bring any eggs

01:54.984 --> 01:56.464
that they can spare.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.900
Good. 'Cause we're low
on eggs in the lounge,

01:57.900 --> 01:59.554
and my doctor says
I need some omega-3s.

01:59.554 --> 02:02.383
That sounds like a great
opportunity to be creative.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.907
I always wanted to do one
of those when I was a kid.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.691
Maybe my second graders
can participate.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.084
Here we go.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.390
Oh, I mean,
I know my kids

02:09.390 --> 02:11.566
won't be as good as yours,
of course,

02:11.566 --> 02:13.437
but I just think it sounds
like fun for the kids.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.352
It's not fun, it's science.

02:15.352 --> 02:18.573
Well, maybe it can be both.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.923
I'm sure my kids are gonna have
a blast doing the egg drop.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.925
The egg drop is too advanced
for your students,

02:22.925 --> 02:25.145
but if you'd like them
to partake, it's your funeral.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.235
More like my fun-eral.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.500
Yeah.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.155
Here's Tamika's homework,
Ms. Howard.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.202
Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.943
You have a good one.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.249
Learn lots, boo!

02:43.250 --> 02:44.860
As a good Christian woman,

02:44.860 --> 02:49.560
I would never mark my body
with such an obscenity.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.128
I don't even believe in saying
that word out loud.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.216
Ugh.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.262
My favorite "B" word?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.089
Barbara.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.874
Oh! Bible.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.572
Blessing.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.226
Blueberries.

03:05.228 --> 03:08.405
Okay, so I was promised
these are definitely not snakes.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.277
Oh,
that's good to know.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.019
This is part
of my recovery elixir.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.326
Strong like bull.

03:17.588 --> 03:18.633
Oh, good morning, y'all.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
Did you just get here?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.158
No.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.160
So, how much glitter would
you say your kids are using

03:24.160 --> 03:25.466
on their egg drop
thingies?

03:25.466 --> 03:27.119
We never use glitter
on our <i>thingies,</i>

03:27.119 --> 03:28.295
because that
would add mass

03:28.295 --> 03:29.731
which would throw off
the equation.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.472
Okay, so maybe just
like a dash, then?

03:32.473 --> 03:33.691
Answer?

03:35.476 --> 03:37.173
Hello, Mr. Hill.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.916
The nerve of that guy.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.397
We've had a long-standing beef
ever since I got here.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.137
Really? It seems like
he's just polite to you.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.836
No, he's very
passive-aggressive.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.838
Don't even ask me why. Okay.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.840
You feel like the egg drop
is right for your kids?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.929
I mean, it takes a fairly decent
understanding of physics.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.670
Yeah,
I'm sure it's right,

03:55.670 --> 03:58.629
because learning should be fun
and about new experiences,

03:58.629 --> 04:00.196
and not whether or not
the eggs break.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.329
It's actually only about
whether or not the eggs break.

04:02.329 --> 04:05.157
Oh, my God, you won't shut up
about this egg drop.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.029
And now your kids
told my kids.

04:07.029 --> 04:09.466
Now my kids are all excited,
so I gotta do it.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.513
And all these wasted eggs
when the Cowboys are in town.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.906
Now I gotta throw Molotov
cocktails at their bus.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.217
You guys are doing
a great job.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.045
These are so cute.

04:23.045 --> 04:26.048
Eli, I love how yours
has all those plastic straws.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.658
Watch out, turtles.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.530
Oh, and, Nia,
yours has a heart on it.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.010
That's so-- I can't wait to see
how these work, guys.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.056
I named my egg Ralph!

04:34.056 --> 04:36.493
I put a face on him
- and everything.
- Aww!

04:36.493 --> 04:39.670
Well, Ralph looks egg-cited
for the egg drop tomorrow.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.064
He's my best friend.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.892
My only friend.

04:43.892 --> 04:47.504
Oh, yeah, Eli is fine.
He's exaggerating.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.594
I've seen him talk to Nia
before, I think.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.902
Excuse me.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.251
I was just wondering if,
you know,

04:55.251 --> 04:57.079
when you are around
the children,

04:57.079 --> 04:58.907
if you might...

04:58.907 --> 05:01.083
cover up a bit.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.911
Oh, yeah, of course.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.434
Thank you.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.219
You have a good one.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.220
Ms. Howard.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.831
Yes?
What's S-L--

05:09.831 --> 05:11.528
It is, uh...

05:11.528 --> 05:15.663
the Saint Louis University
of Technology.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.665
And it is a very fine
university, yes, it is.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.144
Please, have a seat.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.713
How is a ladder
that tall even possible?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.889
'Cause of physics?

05:24.889 --> 05:26.369
The thing we're
kinda doing here?

05:26.369 --> 05:28.023
Mr. Morton:
And lastly, we have Omar's

05:28.023 --> 05:30.068
gravitational resistance mechanism,

05:30.068 --> 05:33.550
with a payload
of 58.7 grams.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.770
May Sir Isaac Newton
have mercy on your soul.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.815
Though, such a thing
does not exist.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.607
Well done, eighth graders.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.610
I have taught you
some serious science

05:49.610 --> 05:51.568
that will serve you
for the rest of your lives.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.049
And now, without further ado...

05:54.049 --> 05:55.920
the second graders.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.620
Hey! Thanks for coming
to support.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.273
Of course.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.492
Plus, I didn't want
to miss a chance

06:02.492 --> 06:04.146
to see Morton
with egg on his face.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.974
Look, kids, my esteemed
colleague, Mr. Hill,

06:05.974 --> 06:07.410
has joined us.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.544
Hmm, hmm.
Keep poking the bear, Morton.

06:10.544 --> 06:13.329
You know, I'm just gonna double
fist these so I'm done quicker.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.679
You got this,
Ms. Schemmenti!
Whoo!

06:33.218 --> 06:34.437
See what a little
can-do attitude

06:34.437 --> 06:36.352
and optimism can get you?

06:36.352 --> 06:37.353
Can't wait.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.140
Oh, good. I didn't miss
Stump-ty Dumpty's
turn at the top.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.142
Is it just me or is this ladder
getting much taller?

06:44.142 --> 06:45.361
Right?

06:45.361 --> 06:46.928
Somebody get me
some magic beans.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.495
You know, like
"Jack and the Beanstalk"?

06:48.495 --> 06:51.454
- Get it?
- Climb the ladder, Janine.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.935
All right, all right.
Just give me a minute.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.024
I don't to get the bends, Melissa.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.939
Okay, here we go.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.289
Going up the ladder.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.943
All right, yeah.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.336
Mr. Morton, is it necessary
to go to the top of it?

07:04.336 --> 07:05.642
It is? Okay.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.645
Can someone give me
a bigger basket?

07:08.645 --> 07:09.733
Okay.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.216
I should've done
a time lapse.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.392
We have made it to the top.

07:16.392 --> 07:17.524
Oh, my God.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.829
Okay. Here we go.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.091
First one!

07:21.049 --> 07:22.616
Oh.

07:22.616 --> 07:25.314
Oh, um... it's okay, Tre.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.316
That made a fun splat,
all right?

07:27.316 --> 07:28.535
Okay, next up.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.884
This is going great.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.756
Oh.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.236
But we're having a good time.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.846
Ooh, marshmallows!

07:36.673 --> 07:39.023
Sponges.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.766
This one's just an egg.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.115
Oh, no.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.682
All right, one more.

07:45.682 --> 07:46.683
This one's gonna make it.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.121
Two eggs, wow!

07:50.121 --> 07:51.949
Look away!

07:56.519 --> 07:57.781
No!

08:00.262 --> 08:02.046
Ralph?!

08:02.046 --> 08:04.179
He was my best friend!

08:04.179 --> 08:06.094
Someone get a Band-Aid!

08:09.445 --> 08:11.491
There's starving children
in America, Janine.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.883
It's okay!

08:12.883 --> 08:14.319
Even though
the eggs broke,

08:14.319 --> 08:16.887
you all did great
and were so creative.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.237
And, uh, look.
Look!

08:19.237 --> 08:20.456
I have these medals.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.893
And if you stop crying
long enough,

08:22.893 --> 08:24.460
I can put them on you.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.768
Because there are no winners
or losers here, right?

08:27.768 --> 08:29.596
Kids, science
is almost exclusively

08:29.596 --> 08:31.119
about winner and losers.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.338
It's okay, Ralph.
You just have to believe.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.602
You may want to have
that children checked out

08:35.602 --> 08:38.039
for salmonella.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.086
Um, hello?

08:42.086 --> 08:43.348
What are you,
some kind of mad scientist?

08:43.348 --> 08:44.959
How did none of
your eggs break?

08:44.959 --> 08:46.961
Easy. I cheated.

08:46.961 --> 08:50.268
Just hard-boiled a bunch
of eggs and, boom, happy class.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.357
And you're proud of that?

08:52.357 --> 08:54.882
Are you proud of having a class
full of crying second graders?

08:54.882 --> 08:57.624
Look, I'd love to teach
my class quantum mechanics.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.495
It's my secret weapon
at the craps table,

08:59.495 --> 09:02.106
but second graders
can't understand it, Janine.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.152
Well, look,
now my kids feel awful,

09:04.152 --> 09:07.111
and they need to have
a successful egg drop
to feel better.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.549
Or maybe there's
a sale on gold stars.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.290
Well, they feel bad because
they failed, but that's science.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.728
Yeah, but it doesn't
- have to be.
- It literally does.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.164
It's part of
the scientific method.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.296
I don't like science--
too many laws.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.385
And who's the judge?
God?

09:20.385 --> 09:23.650
If you think about it, science
is just history plus math.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.303
That's not at all correct.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.827
Y'all seen that movie
"Pacific Rim,"

09:26.827 --> 09:28.568
where Idris Elba
fights the Kaiju?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.830
Now that's science.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.614
You know what's iffy, though?
Pigeons.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.660
- Wait.
- While we're here,

09:33.660 --> 09:35.749
I'm not sure I believe
the moon landing happened.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.054
I don't believe
in the moon.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.447
I believe that
gluten intolerance

09:38.447 --> 09:40.188
is just internalized
White guilt.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.320
- Gluten isn't real!
- Stevie Wonder ain't blind.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.932
You know, Bill Gates--Enough!

09:44.932 --> 09:47.630
Science
is factual and real,

09:47.630 --> 09:49.501
and failure is a part
of the scientific method.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.807
So congratulations, Janine,

09:50.807 --> 09:52.983
you just mastered
the first part.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.637
Now, have you run
your error analysis yet?

09:54.637 --> 09:57.640
Oh, yes, my error analysis
is that we will never give up.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.990
We believe in ourselves,
and we know we can do it.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.775
So... no.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.821
Um, Janine, do you understand
the science behind the egg drop?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.782
Look, if you want your kids
to really get this,

10:08.782 --> 10:10.697
then <i>you're</i> gonna
have to get it.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.221
I used
to love the egg drop.

10:13.221 --> 10:17.486
Look, Amber cancelled on me
for tonight, so if you want...

10:17.486 --> 10:19.009
I can walk you through it.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.577
Thanks, Gregory.
That'd be great, actually.

10:21.577 --> 10:24.232
I bet you believe dinosaurs
really went extinct.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.845
The parent of
one of my students

10:28.845 --> 10:32.675
has a very unsavory marking
across her bosom.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.155
The mom with
the "Bitch" tattoo?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.852
Loved that book.
Movie was meh.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.855
And even after I gently
asked her to cover up,

10:38.855 --> 10:41.902
she came back with a sweater
that was even worse!

10:41.902 --> 10:43.686
Oh, yeah, you gotta do
something about her.

10:43.686 --> 10:44.948
I agree.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.341
Uh, I just want to
chime in and say

10:46.341 --> 10:48.082
I'm gonna sit
this one out.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.954
I think my role here is best
as an active listener.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.914
Although, I will say, the
reclamation of the word "bi--"

10:53.914 --> 10:55.393
Ava, I'm surprised.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.047
You actually have
a problem with this?

10:57.047 --> 10:59.615
Sure do, but it's about
placement not the content.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.225
The clavicle is such
a powerful bone.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.792
Why take attention
away from it?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.968
Keep the tattoos to the tatas.
That's hot.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.710
How could anyone find this
tata tattoo hot?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.233
Much less appropriate?

11:09.233 --> 11:10.626
Well, it's a generational
thing, Barb.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.454
Women her age grew up
with Lil' Kim,

11:12.454 --> 11:14.021
- Foxy Brown, and Eve.
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.240
And I grew up
with Adam and Eve.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.114
And maybe all this young woman
needs is a little guidance.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.593
Heh.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.552
Barb wouldn't be offended
by my tattoos,

11:23.552 --> 11:25.206
unless she speaks Mandarin.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.990
Chinese people
hate my tattoos.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.820
To understand the egg drop,

11:30.820 --> 11:32.256
you have to understand
some scientific principles

11:32.256 --> 11:33.605
that are fairly complex
for a second grader.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.259
I believe
in my second graders.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.478
And I want to show them

11:36.478 --> 11:38.088
that if they believe
in themselves,

11:38.088 --> 11:39.524
they can do anything.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.266
I appreciate the optimism,

11:42.266 --> 11:44.616
but you can't just
positive-attitude

11:44.616 --> 11:45.966
your way through physics.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.881
Well, I beg to differ.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.800
Can you touch my hand?
What?

11:53.800 --> 11:56.063
If you believe in yourself
enough, can you touch my hand?

12:03.505 --> 12:05.289
As I was saying--No, wait, hold on.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.943
Because

12:06.943 --> 12:09.641
if I were to just,
you know, gra--

12:09.641 --> 12:10.773
- Oh. Oh, oh, aah.
- Oh!

12:11.861 --> 12:12.993
Come on.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.866
See, this is why science
shouldn't be taught in schools.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.914
I feel like this is about
something else.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.177
Look, this may come
as a surprise,

12:23.177 --> 12:24.613
but...

12:24.613 --> 12:27.485
I've never been good
at not getting things.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.965
You don't say.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.967
Normally, I'm able to
come into anything

12:30.967 --> 12:33.361
with a positive mindset
and succeed.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.711
Failure is what propels
science forward.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.800
If you can't
accept failure,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.802
then you can never
learn from it.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.326
"If you
can't accept failure,
then you can never--"

12:42.326 --> 12:43.980
I don't sound
like that, Janine.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.416
My voice is quite deep.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.027
Now, if we can get back
to the egg drop.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.035
When I was little, I could
never keep my shoes tied,

12:55.035 --> 12:57.341
and people loved
to make fun of that.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.996
But then I got Velcro shoes,
and they made fun of that, too.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.476
But here's what I learned
about failure--

13:01.476 --> 13:04.609
It sucks and I don't want
my kids to feel it.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.742
Time to get them
some Velcro shoes.

13:06.742 --> 13:07.961
Good to see you.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.527
Hi, baby.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.833
Well, how 'bout that?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.487
So nice to run into you.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.576
You work here, that's a very
predictable scenario.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.534
Yes, but I'm just glad
to have your ear,

13:16.534 --> 13:19.450
because I came across
some information

13:19.450 --> 13:22.845
about a support group
for single mothers.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.370
Okay, well, um...

13:26.370 --> 13:28.764
if Tamika's dad,
my husband...

13:29.765 --> 13:32.855
...of six years,
just so happens to die,

13:32.855 --> 13:34.161
I promise
I'll check it out.

13:34.161 --> 13:37.077
And if you want
some nice clothes,

13:37.077 --> 13:39.166
my daughter's friend, Mallory,

13:39.166 --> 13:43.257
does this monthly clothes swap
for young professionals.

13:43.257 --> 13:46.390
Lots of
expletive-free attire.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.914
Well, I see
what's happening here.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.567
You think you know me,
Miss Lady?

13:49.567 --> 13:51.047
But you don't.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.093
I am not going to trade
first-run items

13:53.093 --> 13:54.746
from <i>my</i> clothing line

13:54.746 --> 13:58.011
with a bunch of diversity,
equity, and inclusion officers.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.577
I did not mean
to upset you.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.971
You can never upset a
professional bitch like myself.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.887
Now you have a wonderful
rest of your day...

14:04.887 --> 14:06.541
Miss Ma'am.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.759
It's Mrs. Howard.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.674
Oh, I know who you are.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.635
Keep painting, kids, okay?

14:13.635 --> 14:14.810
Keep painting.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.290
These are tough as nails now,

14:16.290 --> 14:18.335
so they need to look
really pretty, too.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.077
I finally have my head
wrapped around the egg drop.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.079
It only took Gregory
walking me through it

14:23.079 --> 14:24.776
and then three hours
of YouTube videos

14:24.776 --> 14:26.213
when I still didn't get it.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.258
I've helped my kids
rebuild their egg drops,

14:28.258 --> 14:30.391
and my hypothesis is...

14:30.391 --> 14:32.045
we're going to succeed!

14:34.961 --> 14:37.267
Mr. Morton,
what a surprise.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.921
What makes you drop by?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.662
You took all my scales.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.577
What a great observation.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.710
I hypothesized that taking your
scales would get you down here.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.930
Cause, effect, science.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.629
My students and I are building
new egg drop contraptions.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.240
I now know the science
behind it,

14:53.240 --> 14:56.286
therefore my kids and I
are ready to prove

14:56.286 --> 14:57.940
that we can do anything.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.463
So, I'd like
to kindly request

14:59.463 --> 15:01.030
that you put on
another egg drop event.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.945
Miss Teagues, I have
an eighth grade curriculum

15:02.945 --> 15:05.165
to keep up with,
so no more egg drop.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.601
- We've moved on.
- Wha--

15:06.601 --> 15:08.211
So, no--

15:08.211 --> 15:10.822
What am I supposed
- to tell my kids?
- Not my problem.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.215
If you're looking for
something more their speed,

15:12.215 --> 15:13.825
why don't you teach them
how to tie their shoes?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.485
I want to fight you.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.534
Jacob is right.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.492
That Mr. Morton's
got a real attitude.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.103
He will not put on
another egg drop event.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.279
You know you can do an egg drop
event without him, right?

15:32.279 --> 15:33.628
That's not the point.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.543
Look, I've faced
so many Mr. Mortons

15:35.543 --> 15:37.893
and there are so many
Mr. Mortons in this world,

15:37.893 --> 15:40.243
and I want my kids
to face them now.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.550
And I want to shield them
with the best defense--

15:42.550 --> 15:44.987
positivity.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.729
Janine, your kids
are lucky to have a teacher

15:47.729 --> 15:49.426
who believes in them
as much as you do.

15:49.426 --> 15:54.475
But maybe sometimes, possibly,
you could come at it with, like,

15:54.475 --> 15:57.130
so much positivity
that it's...

15:57.130 --> 15:58.435
toxic.

16:00.089 --> 16:03.092
Mr. Morton's science
is just too advanced for them.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.528
Those are the facts.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.314
Ugh! I know.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.011
I spiraled.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.883
Happens to all of us, but
it happens to you a lot, huh?

16:11.883 --> 16:15.017
So now I have to tell
my kids that I messed up

16:15.017 --> 16:19.543
and that they can't do anything
they put their minds to?

16:19.543 --> 16:22.764
It's the truth,
and the truth is science.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.548
Isn't it our job
to tell them the truth?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.682
That was, like,
a serious question.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.249
I-I haven't been here very long,
I don't know the answer to that.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.380
Should I be lying more?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.122
Oh!

16:35.907 --> 16:37.866
Looking to refresh
your wardrobe, Barb?

16:37.866 --> 16:40.129
That stuff is hot, but a little
flashier than I pegged you for.

16:40.129 --> 16:43.045
This is Tamika's mother's
clothing line.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.308
And it is worse
than I expected.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.267
I'm--
T-There are cuss words here

16:47.267 --> 16:49.660
I didn't even know existed.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.227
Well, dang, if this
is worrying you so much

16:51.227 --> 16:52.576
that you're spending
your free time

16:52.576 --> 16:53.925
cyberstalking
this lady's store,

16:53.925 --> 16:55.231
you must really have
a problem with her.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.974
Do you think this child
is in danger?
No.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.802
Okay, well, how's Tamika's
grades and attendance?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.412
Stellar.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.805
Okay, then what's
the real problem?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.546
'Cause I'm not hearing
anything to worry about.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.505
Okay, I admit it.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.159
I misjudged her
when I confronted her,

17:10.159 --> 17:13.858
but I just don't understand
why a grown woman,

17:13.858 --> 17:17.558
a mother,
would act like this.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.995
Okay, well,
let me ask you this--

17:19.995 --> 17:21.518
do you need to?

17:24.130 --> 17:25.827
Uh, before you finish
that order,

17:25.827 --> 17:27.437
throw in a pair of those
"Whore" leggings.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.135
I gotta gala next week.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.099
Are we getting balloons
because we're great?

17:37.099 --> 17:39.797
Well, you are great,
but these are actually

17:39.797 --> 17:42.061
for an age-appropriate
science lesson.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.629
Please no more science,
Miss Teagues.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.675
Can those lift me in the air?

17:47.675 --> 17:49.372
If you believe hard enough,
they can.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.375
Well, that actually
isn't true.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.595
But we're going to
learn about why.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.075
Just give them to us.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.772
No!

17:57.772 --> 17:59.382
We're doing this.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.385
Thank you, Ayesha.

18:02.385 --> 18:06.259
Oh, Tamika, you did
a wonderful job!

18:06.259 --> 18:08.130
Thank you.
My mom taught me.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.611
She said it's important
to know about flowers

18:10.611 --> 18:13.092
so you can tell when a man
gets you cheap ones.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.443
Okay, thank you.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.618
All right.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.010
Let's get ourselves ready.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.447
Thank you.

18:20.447 --> 18:21.665
Get your stuff.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.014
Uh, e-excuse me.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.320
I just wanted
to let you know

18:24.320 --> 18:27.149
that Tamika's work
was so well done.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.717
I thank you for putting
in the extra effort.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.373
And I want to apologize.

18:35.636 --> 18:39.683
I am sorry for the assumptions
that I made about your character

18:39.683 --> 18:41.946
when you have been
showing me all year long

18:41.946 --> 18:43.644
the type of parent
you are.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.474
It's not the first time
this has happened to me.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.302
People are quick to judge, but...

18:49.302 --> 18:52.000
that's part of the thinking
behind my apparel line.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.915
You see, one day soon
when people hear

18:53.915 --> 18:56.135
"Forever Bitch Apparel,"

18:56.135 --> 18:59.094
they're gonna think
about locally made,

18:59.094 --> 19:01.749
Black-owned, and sustainable
business practices.

19:01.749 --> 19:05.361
And that is something
that I would love to support.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.015
Really?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.973
And, you know, sometimes
I do get a little busy

19:08.973 --> 19:11.062
and I forget that Forever Bitch
isn't for the kids.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.456
So I'll be sure to wear
PG-rated clothing from now on

19:13.456 --> 19:14.718
when I pick Tamika up.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.068
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.636
And that's a--
a lovely...

19:21.290 --> 19:22.813
...mouth accessory.

19:22.813 --> 19:26.208
I-Is that from your line, Forever...

19:26.208 --> 19:28.210
Yeah, yeah, look,
get a little closer.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.343
Check out the quality
of this engraving.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.475
Like, Mrs. Howard.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.829
Three helium balloons
was not enough.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.005
We failed.
But what did we learn?

19:41.005 --> 19:42.746
That we need
more balloons?

19:42.746 --> 19:45.227
Right, because balloons
can only hold

19:45.227 --> 19:46.794
a certain amount of...

19:46.794 --> 19:49.013
- Mass!
- That's right.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.667
- I'm impressed.
- Yeah?

19:50.667 --> 19:54.193
Well, I realized that
the egg drop was too advanced,

19:54.193 --> 19:57.587
but then I decided to experiment
with another special project--

19:57.587 --> 19:59.328
the egg lift.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.765
And it involves something
they like already-- balloons.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.376
All right, release!

20:04.812 --> 20:08.076
Mr. Morton, ah,
how nice of you to be here.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.252
- Hello.
- You took my helium tank.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.341
I did, and that's because
I wanted you to see us learn

20:12.341 --> 20:13.690
all about--

20:17.172 --> 20:18.956
Oh, no.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.225
Not Ralph Jr.!

20:27.487 --> 20:28.531
Oh.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.272
Um, uh, science!

20:30.272 --> 20:31.621
Science!

20:31.621 --> 20:33.188
Yes!

20:33.188 --> 20:36.278
Oh, did we egg-ceed
your egg-spectations?

20:36.278 --> 20:37.801
Egg.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.238
Oh, and you have
a little something right...

20:41.196 --> 20:43.242
...there.
Yep, mm-hmm.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.072
Well, and then I said
the gaming industry is a bil--

20:48.072 --> 20:49.900
is billions,
like, not millions,

20:49.900 --> 20:51.293
like, billions of dollars,
which means that--Mr. Hill,

20:51.293 --> 20:52.555
do you need any help
carrying those to your car?

20:52.555 --> 20:55.036
No, no, thank you.
I am fine.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.690
You have a restful night
and a pleasant weekend.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.519
Yep! You, too!

20:59.519 --> 21:01.085
See?
What is that guy's deal?

21:01.085 --> 21:02.739
That guy
really gets my goat.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.306
I don't know
what that means,

21:04.306 --> 21:05.612
but that man is nothing
but nice to you, okay?

21:05.612 --> 21:07.657
This is all in your head.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.093
"Have a pleasant weekend."

21:09.093 --> 21:10.530
Stop.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.705
He doesn't sound like that.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.837
I--
Nobody sounds like that.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.666
What's wrong with you?

21:16.666 --> 21:19.147
Nothing.
It's been a long week.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.583
Geez.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.150
Oh, Jacob Hill?
Hate him.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.152
Always have, always will.
