00:33.575 --> 00:35.702
- Oh, the settings on your TV
are probably wrong.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.079

No.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.774
- No, I'm not gonna say,
"I'm poo-poo brown."

a very generous tip.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.651
you can be as lucky
as you want to be.

- Nobody ever won the lottery
with elbow grease, Dad.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.575
- Oh, Donnie,
luck is not about money.

06:07.658 --> 06:08.868
Take me, for example.

06:08.951 --> 06:09.994
I only earn a modest salary,

06:10.078 --> 06:13.164

to be the man you want to be.

{\an3}- But what do I do when
people are mean to me, Dad?

06:24.967 --> 06:27.428
{\an1}- Well, you have to learn to
turn the other cheek.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.763
{\an1}You have to be
the bigger--

06:28.846 --> 06:30.389
{\an1}Shoot!
Gosh darn it.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.309
{\an1}And, gosh darn it, if someone
treats you wrong,

06:33.392 --> 06:34.310
{\an1}you just kill them
with kindness.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.312
{\an3}- Has anybody ever been
mean to you, Dad?

06:36.395 --> 06:39.148
{\an1}- Well, that's an
interesting question, Donnie.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.483
{\an1}Uh...

06:40.566 --> 06:41.651
{\an1}Yeah, you know,
I guess, yes,

06:41.734 --> 06:42.985
{\an1}there are a few people
in my life

06:43.069 --> 06:45.363
that occasionally I have
a little difficult time

06:45.446 --> 06:46.405
getting along with.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.323
{\an3}- Why?

06:47.406 --> 06:48.699
{\an1}- Well, it's
a long story, son.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.076
But it all started when--

06:50.159 --> 06:51.494
Jiminy Crickets!

06:51.577 --> 06:53.412
{\an1}We're getting bombarded
out here.

{\an3}- Dad, this is like
a forever day.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.834
{\an1}- What?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.210
- I had a great time

would last forever.

07:03.172 --> 07:03.756
{\an1}Me too.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.967
God damn it!

Stupid birds!

doing with your shells?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.139
- I'm just gulping them down,
dude.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.890
{\an1}Ah, you do not
want to do that.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.475
{\an1}You're gonna tear up
your insides, man.

into a little pocket

{\an1}- You sewed a pocket
in your bird suit?

07:20.606 --> 07:21.607
- Heck yeah.
