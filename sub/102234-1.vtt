00:04.424 --> 00:09.424
(storm raging)
(electricity crackling)

00:20.438 --> 00:23.438
(eerie tense music)

00:25.307 --> 00:28.504
(glass shattering)

00:28.504 --> 00:30.731
(glass shattering)

00:30.731 --> 00:35.731
(eerie tense music)
(glass shattering)

00:36.011 --> 00:38.747
(glass shattering)

00:38.747 --> 00:39.580
- Come on.

00:40.462 --> 00:44.295
(praying in foreign language)

00:52.920 --> 00:53.753
- Right there.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.570
Right there.

00:56.570 --> 00:57.403
- What?

00:58.883 --> 00:59.800
What is it?

01:00.995 --> 01:02.683
- It's--
- Answer me!

01:02.683 --> 01:03.516
- It's.

01:03.516 --> 01:04.598
- I, I hear it.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.459
- Watch out!

01:05.459 --> 01:08.459
(eerie tense music)

01:13.264 --> 01:14.097
Take me.

01:15.163 --> 01:16.913
Just take me instead.

01:19.883 --> 01:22.383
(eerie music)

01:44.398 --> 01:46.158
(eerie tense music)

01:46.158 --> 01:51.158
(grunting)
(wet crunching)

02:20.117 --> 02:23.617
(eerie suspenseful music)

02:30.107 --> 02:31.215
- No.

02:31.215 --> 02:33.382
(panting)

02:35.223 --> 02:37.723
(eerie music)

03:21.760 --> 03:23.710
- Think they got all the squatters out?

03:24.657 --> 03:26.094
(grunting)

03:26.094 --> 03:27.160
- I don't know.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.187
Let's go find out.

03:50.444 --> 03:54.187
(knocking at door)

03:54.187 --> 03:56.348
- Who could that be?

03:56.348 --> 03:57.506
- Hi.

03:57.506 --> 03:58.383
- Hi.

03:58.383 --> 03:59.804
So glad you're here.

03:59.804 --> 04:00.637
- Me, too.

04:00.637 --> 04:01.470
Hi.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.303
- Hello, Wendy.
- Hi, again.

04:03.970 --> 04:04.803
Wow.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.023
- Group hug.

04:10.150 --> 04:10.983
Any hug?

04:12.510 --> 04:14.960
Okay, they're too hold for that.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.970
- Yeah, probably.

04:15.970 --> 04:16.803
Uncle Donald.

04:16.803 --> 04:17.717
- Ah, I got ya.

04:17.717 --> 04:18.550
Ah, ah.

04:19.490 --> 04:20.323
- Nice place.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.253
- Thanks.

04:22.253 --> 04:23.086
You want to help us move some boxes?

04:23.086 --> 04:23.919
- Yeah, sure.

04:24.820 --> 04:25.760
Jamie, where'd you go?

04:25.760 --> 04:26.763
You gotta help out.

04:28.975 --> 04:30.583
- You know we'll never
get rid of them now?

04:38.100 --> 04:39.033
- Does this work?

04:41.100 --> 04:42.573
- No, not for a long time.

04:44.186 --> 04:45.086
- It's still cool.

04:46.330 --> 04:48.740
- Hey, how are your videos going?

04:48.740 --> 04:49.600
You still doing that?

04:49.600 --> 04:50.900
- My show?

04:50.900 --> 04:52.102
Yeah.

04:52.102 --> 04:53.823
- Did you catch a ghost yet?

04:54.920 --> 04:55.753
- Nope.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.040
- As long as you're having fun.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.790
- I'll catch a real ghost.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.260
Don't you worry.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.220
- Sure you will.

05:04.821 --> 05:06.530
But in the meantime,

05:06.530 --> 05:08.863
could you help me get some
of those clothes upstairs?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.960
- Only because you asked so nicely.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.030
- Please.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.193
I thank you.

05:37.369 --> 05:40.036
(door creaking)

05:59.110 --> 05:59.943
- Hey.

06:03.410 --> 06:04.470
What are you writing a novel?

06:04.470 --> 06:05.960
- [Charlie] Almost there.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.240
- Let me guess, this is for
a girl you're interested in?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.570
- A girl, no.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.720
- Oh you're writing to more
than one girl at a time, huh?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.930
- They swipe right, I swipe right.

06:14.930 --> 06:15.763
- What a world.

06:15.763 --> 06:17.570
It used to be dates, now it's swipes.

06:17.570 --> 06:18.403
How do you keep track of that?

06:18.403 --> 06:20.390
I mean, if you're talking
to more than one girl

06:20.390 --> 06:21.710
what happens if you send the wrong message

06:21.710 --> 06:22.560
to the wrong one?

06:24.020 --> 06:25.450
Yeah, okay.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.330
Didn't think of that, did you?

06:26.330 --> 06:28.550
Here, why don't you put
that there behind you

06:28.550 --> 06:30.300
while you mull that over, hot shot.

06:31.580 --> 06:32.480
So what's up, man?

06:34.140 --> 06:35.043
- Nothing much.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.200
- Listen, I was gonna surprise you

06:40.200 --> 06:43.790
but I got the same system you have,

06:43.790 --> 06:46.200
the new one, so you and I
can play online together.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.300
It's pretty frigging sweet, right?

06:47.300 --> 06:48.950
- Didn't know you played video games.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.280
- Oh yeah, you could say I dabble.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.833
- Right.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.083
(laughing)

06:57.120 --> 06:58.383
- So, Charlie, listen.

07:00.450 --> 07:04.410
I know things have been kind of different

07:04.410 --> 07:05.603
for you and Jamie now.

07:08.085 --> 07:08.918
I mean, I miss my brother

07:08.918 --> 07:10.363
but for you guys, it's just.

07:12.740 --> 07:14.820
All happened pretty quick.

07:14.820 --> 07:16.270
Tough year for your mom, too.

07:21.530 --> 07:23.090
Anyway, I know a little
a bit about the trouble

07:23.090 --> 07:24.276
you had a few weeks back.

07:24.276 --> 07:25.109
- Look, I really don't want

07:25.109 --> 07:26.127
to do this right now.

07:26.127 --> 07:26.960
- I just, I just,

07:26.960 --> 07:27.793
I just want you to know,

07:27.793 --> 07:29.910
I had a phase like that in my 20s, too.

07:29.910 --> 07:32.440
I was angry at everyone and everything.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.230
Yeah, I got into a lot of fights.

07:34.230 --> 07:35.503
A lot.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.463
I never won one fight.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.557
Not even a single one.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.330
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the pale blue dot?

07:50.756 --> 07:52.360
- Pale?

07:52.360 --> 07:53.760
- Really?

07:53.760 --> 07:54.920
I never.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.960
Oh, well I gotta tell you now.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.240
So, at the university, I got
all these students, right?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.800
They're all stressing
out about their papers,

08:01.800 --> 08:03.750
about their applications, their futures.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.160
Like their whole lives.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.527
Who they're gonna be.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.930
You know what I always tell 'em?

08:08.930 --> 08:10.257
- What?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.200
- I tell 'em one of my
all time favorite lessons.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.660
It's the lesson that made me want

08:13.660 --> 08:16.216
to study science in the first place.

08:16.216 --> 08:18.370
It's a lesson that my
science teacher taught me

08:18.370 --> 08:19.570
about the pale blue dot.

08:21.270 --> 08:23.920
So, basically the
concept is simple, right,

08:23.920 --> 08:27.597
but it comes from one of
the greatest minds ever.

08:27.597 --> 08:30.870
The idea is, if you could see planet Earth

08:30.870 --> 08:32.690
from far enough away,

08:32.690 --> 08:35.030
you would see that it's
just this tiny speck

08:35.030 --> 08:37.230
in a vast cosmic darkness.

08:37.230 --> 08:39.863
It's just this tiny, pale blue dot.

08:40.950 --> 08:41.783
That's it.

08:42.636 --> 08:44.310
Kinda makes you put things in perspective,

08:44.310 --> 08:45.160
you know, I mean.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.150
Think about everything
you know to be true,

08:48.150 --> 08:50.420
who you are, your family.

08:50.420 --> 08:52.190
How you could be better.

08:52.190 --> 08:55.340
Maybe how your problems aren't as vast

08:55.340 --> 08:56.790
as they might seem right now.

08:58.350 --> 08:59.183
You know?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.294
Anyway, you look it up.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.100
Pale blue dot, you'll look it up?

09:06.100 --> 09:07.030
Yeah, I mean it.

09:07.030 --> 09:07.980
- No, I will.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.010
- Oh, hey, I got something for you.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.840
Your father's, now yours.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.280
- No, way.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.630
- Try it on.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.880
- I didn't know you had this.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.833
- Yeah, well.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.680
I needed it but now I'm gonna pass it on.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.100
- This is the jacket he had on

09:34.100 --> 09:36.200
the first time we went riding.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.283
I was scared, you know,
afraid I'd fall off the back.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.886
He said if I just held on tight enough,

09:43.886 --> 09:46.326
I'd have nothing to fear.

09:46.326 --> 09:48.073
- Well now you got the
bike and the jacket.

09:49.860 --> 09:50.770
Listen, don't forget I'm here

09:50.770 --> 09:52.370
if you want to talk to me, okay?

09:53.220 --> 09:55.940
For anything, that's what family's about.

09:55.940 --> 09:56.773
That's here.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.410
(banging)
(muffled shouting)

10:00.410 --> 10:01.814
- What was that?

10:01.814 --> 10:04.731
(muffled shouting)

10:05.810 --> 10:06.660
- Help, somebody.

10:06.660 --> 10:07.493
- Jamie.

10:09.151 --> 10:09.984
Are you okay?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.060
- Yeah, I just.

10:11.060 --> 10:11.910
I got locked in there.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.107
I sort of freaked out.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.790
- Jamie, honey.

10:16.790 --> 10:17.623
There's...

10:18.830 --> 10:19.973
There's no lock.

10:23.296 --> 10:25.915
- You know.

10:25.915 --> 10:26.748
- Sorry.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.330
- It's okay.

10:31.474 --> 10:34.224
(engine revving)

10:45.185 --> 10:47.935
(engine revving)

11:00.000 --> 11:00.833
Another box.

11:02.610 --> 11:05.700
- Did you take what you want
from the pile in the cellar?

11:05.700 --> 11:06.533
- What pile?

11:07.701 --> 11:09.930
- The pile, the stuff, the boxes

11:09.930 --> 11:11.790
that the last owners left.

11:11.790 --> 11:12.660
- We're taking from that?

11:12.660 --> 11:13.873
- Yeah, I got a lamp.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.193
- I need a lamp.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.270
- Everybody needs a lamp.

12:08.410 --> 12:10.493
(shouts)

12:19.447 --> 12:22.947
(tense suspenseful music)

12:39.770 --> 12:44.423
- Oh and this triangle
symbol, it's recurring.

12:46.470 --> 12:50.030
Whoever wrote this didn't
want to spell it out.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.580
It's like it's written in code.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.570
- Yeah or complete gibberish.

12:53.570 --> 12:57.135
- Position matters.

12:57.135 --> 12:58.060
- Well yeah.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.683
- Don't let it decide?

13:04.070 --> 13:06.483
First is sight.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.833
Second is hear.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.783
Third is speak.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.587
- You gonna eat that one?

13:23.135 --> 13:24.759
- Yeah get close,

13:24.759 --> 13:28.373
close as possible.

13:30.650 --> 13:33.303
Read incantation.

13:33.303 --> 13:35.553
(laughing)

13:36.770 --> 13:37.980
Uh oh.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.530
Would you believe some of
this is written in Latin?

13:41.760 --> 13:42.603
Okay.

13:45.013 --> 13:46.653
- Would you believe I'm still hungry?

13:48.130 --> 13:49.340
- Did you hear that?

13:49.340 --> 13:50.840
- What?

13:50.840 --> 13:53.110
- The.
(distant scratching)

13:53.110 --> 13:54.280
Scratching.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.799
- What?

13:55.799 --> 13:58.780
No, I don't hear anything.

13:58.780 --> 13:59.923
- In the walls.

14:02.020 --> 14:02.853
- Oh, come on.

14:02.853 --> 14:04.010
Don't tell me we have mice or something.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.313
I gotta call somebody.

14:11.890 --> 14:12.723
Wen?

14:14.920 --> 14:15.980
Wen.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.813
- Yeah?

14:16.813 --> 14:17.646
- You okay?

14:19.380 --> 14:20.960
- Yeah.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.340
- Okay.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.300
You know what, I'm gonna go upstairs,

14:23.300 --> 14:24.133
get ready for bed.

14:24.133 --> 14:25.263
Cool?

14:25.263 --> 14:26.513
- Cool.
- Cool.

14:49.864 --> 14:52.947
(objects clattering)

15:18.736 --> 15:23.348
(wood breaking)
(gasping)

15:23.348 --> 15:28.348
(wood breaking)
(objects clattering)

15:31.473 --> 15:34.973
(eerie suspenseful music)

15:53.465 --> 15:54.618
(glass shattering)

15:54.618 --> 15:56.785
(gasping)

16:44.848 --> 16:47.431
(oil sizzling)

18:26.600 --> 18:28.767
(panting)

18:32.297 --> 18:37.297
(eerie suspenseful music)
(pen scraping)

18:59.933 --> 19:02.600
(woman humming)

19:15.304 --> 19:17.475
(doorbell ringing)

19:17.475 --> 19:18.392
- I got it.

19:23.013 --> 19:23.960
Hey, Nancy.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.793
- Hey.

19:24.793 --> 19:25.738
- Come on in.

19:25.738 --> 19:26.571
- Thanks.

19:29.810 --> 19:31.543
- Wendy, Nancy's here.

19:33.700 --> 19:34.533
Sorry.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.480
- Nancy, you're a lifesaver.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.290
- No problem at all.

19:41.290 --> 19:42.123
- Nancy, good to see you

19:42.123 --> 19:42.956
but I need some more coffee.

19:42.956 --> 19:43.890
You want a cup?

19:43.890 --> 19:44.930
- No, but I get it.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.910
- Donuts, I made donuts.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.500
- No, I'm good.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.485
No thanks, though.

19:49.485 --> 19:50.890
- Wen?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.233
Just eat 'em all myself.

19:54.430 --> 19:57.180
- Yup, I married him.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.730
- Yes.
- Weird, right?

19:58.730 --> 20:00.853
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

20:03.370 --> 20:07.170
I tried working my way
through the Wednesday

20:08.150 --> 20:10.250
and Thursday classes

20:13.540 --> 20:14.810
but no dice.

20:14.810 --> 20:15.643
- Don't worry.

20:15.643 --> 20:17.370
You must be so busy moving, anyway.

20:17.370 --> 20:18.610
Let me grade 'em.

20:18.610 --> 20:20.393
- Oh Nancy, I can't do that to you.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.443
I just feel so.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.570
I don't know.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.520
You need to like, relax, you know,

20:33.520 --> 20:35.330
hang out with your friends, whatever.

20:35.330 --> 20:36.853
Be a 20 something.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.470
I'm the boring old married one.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.020
- Wen, trust me, I'm looking for something

20:43.020 --> 20:44.340
to keep me busy right now.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.890
Let me grade them.

20:45.890 --> 20:47.200
- [Wendy] Are you okay?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.033
- Yeah, why?

20:48.033 --> 20:48.940
- Are you sick?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.470
- [Nancy] No.

20:50.470 --> 20:53.200
- You love Donald's home made donuts.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.050
- Yeah, I'm just watching my figure.

20:55.050 --> 20:55.883
- Why?

20:58.710 --> 21:02.493
- Brian and I, sort of, you know.

21:03.940 --> 21:05.850
- Oh, sorry, honey.

21:05.850 --> 21:08.050
But why would you need
to watch your figure?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.680
- I think it was one of
the girls at the gym.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.746
You know, one of the gym girls

21:13.746 --> 21:15.810
who takes a picture of herself

21:15.810 --> 21:16.890
and posts it online,

21:16.890 --> 21:19.520
every time she's working
out while she's working out,

21:19.520 --> 21:21.930
when she's making herself a smoothie.

21:21.930 --> 21:23.490
You know, the kind of girl you want

21:23.490 --> 21:24.807
to hit with your car?

21:24.807 --> 21:26.567
(laugh)
- Wow.

21:26.567 --> 21:27.570
(laughing)

21:27.570 --> 21:28.413
Wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:29.650 --> 21:30.483
Yeah.

21:33.630 --> 21:34.463
- Listen.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.880
The right person for you

21:37.880 --> 21:40.310
will see that you're smart, kind,

21:40.310 --> 21:42.540
and drop dead gorgeous

21:42.540 --> 21:44.940
and they won't need a picture to prove it.

21:44.940 --> 21:46.133
Screw Brian.

21:48.210 --> 21:49.410
- This is why you rock

21:49.410 --> 21:51.993
and also why I'm grading
these papers for you, Wen.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.010
- You drive a hard bargain.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.320
- Mm hmm.

21:55.320 --> 22:00.320
Listen, I sort of walked here, you know,

22:00.423 --> 22:03.110
exercise, so.

22:03.110 --> 22:04.460
- I'll give you a ride in.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.510
- Thanks.
- Donald,

22:05.510 --> 22:07.100
I'm heading out with Nancy.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.270
- [Donald] Okay.

22:08.270 --> 22:09.840
- Let's go.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.673
- Okay.

22:40.263 --> 22:42.530
(object clattering)

22:42.530 --> 22:43.363
- Hello?

22:53.865 --> 22:56.532
(door creaking)

23:04.020 --> 23:04.853
Wen?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.013
Wendy, I'm home.

23:22.724 --> 23:26.807
(whispering in foreign language)

23:32.910 --> 23:33.743
Honey?

23:38.270 --> 23:39.103
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.547
- When did you get here?

23:42.547 --> 23:43.413
- You okay?

23:45.897 --> 23:46.980
- I feel a little sick.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.663
- Oh, what's going on?

23:49.598 --> 23:51.765
- I was gonna make dinner.

23:52.937 --> 23:53.770
- Oh.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.130
Oh no, you got a fever.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.203
Okay, wow.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.370
You know, let me run upstairs

23:59.370 --> 24:00.570
and change real quick,
I'll come back down.

24:00.570 --> 24:01.403
I'm gonna take care of you.

24:01.403 --> 24:02.714
Okay, just.

24:02.714 --> 24:03.547
- But I'm still gonna help with dinner.

24:03.547 --> 24:04.380
- No, no, no.

24:04.380 --> 24:05.213
I'm cooking.

24:05.213 --> 24:06.046
Just.

24:34.577 --> 24:37.244
(meat sizzling)

25:08.242 --> 25:11.578
(eerie suspenseful music)

25:11.578 --> 25:16.578
(oil bubbling)
(eerie suspenseful music)

25:16.780 --> 25:18.379
(gasping)

25:18.379 --> 25:20.629
(shouting)

25:26.999 --> 25:31.999
Okay.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.423
Babe, come on.

25:45.950 --> 25:48.040
Step up, step up.

25:48.040 --> 25:48.873
Okay.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.119
(shouting)

26:35.119 --> 26:36.090
(eerie tense music)

26:36.090 --> 26:37.593
- I heard it in this house.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.040
- Let's go back to the hospital.

26:40.040 --> 26:40.890
- No, no, no, no.

26:42.540 --> 26:43.753
Listen to me.

26:44.949 --> 26:46.163
I heard it.

26:48.529 --> 26:49.362
Please.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.590
- Sweetheart, you have
a really high fever.

26:52.590 --> 26:54.003
You're just not yourself.

26:56.655 --> 26:57.488
- I promise you.

27:01.316 --> 27:02.149
It's here.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.378
It's here.

27:04.378 --> 27:07.128
(heart pounding)

27:08.871 --> 27:10.288
Right behind you.

27:13.629 --> 27:15.092
In the dark.

27:15.092 --> 27:20.092
(heart pounding)
(suspenseful music)

28:34.790 --> 28:35.623
- Hey guys.

28:35.623 --> 28:37.770
It's Jamie, back for another video

28:37.770 --> 28:40.600
at the world famous Blood Shed

28:40.600 --> 28:43.460
where it was said that
three women were killed.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.950
They say there was so
much blood on the inside,

28:45.950 --> 28:48.130
it painted the walls red.

28:48.130 --> 28:49.220
Creepy.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.480
Now, last week we went
to the ghoul school,

28:51.480 --> 28:53.020
that sucked, I know.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.330
Nothing there.

28:54.330 --> 28:57.653
But this time I'm hoping
we've got something real.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.630
Okay, I'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.

29:04.630 --> 29:06.080
Don't be scared of my device.

29:07.210 --> 29:08.640
Right, so.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.465
This is just an
electromagnetic field reader,

29:11.465 --> 29:13.790
so I can get a sense where you are

29:13.790 --> 29:16.023
and talk to you.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.440
And I'm recording you.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.913
So, smile.

29:20.942 --> 29:22.290
Okay.

29:22.290 --> 29:24.740
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

29:24.740 --> 29:25.900
If the answer is yes,

29:25.900 --> 29:26.990
take a step towards me

29:26.990 --> 29:29.340
and my EMF will light up red

29:29.340 --> 29:30.993
and if it's no step away.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.679
Okay.

29:33.679 --> 29:36.346
(machine beeps)

29:38.040 --> 29:39.363
Are you a girl?

29:43.490 --> 29:45.033
Are you a boy?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.093
Okay, um.

29:51.430 --> 29:52.933
Let's try something different.

29:54.804 --> 29:56.693
Are you happy I found you?

30:00.710 --> 30:02.643
Are you upset I found you?

30:02.643 --> 30:05.476
(machine beeping)

30:09.470 --> 30:10.303
Okay.

30:12.140 --> 30:12.973
Okay.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.663
Am I bothering you?

30:17.628 --> 30:21.030
(machine beeping)

30:21.030 --> 30:22.403
Do you want me to leave?

30:24.132 --> 30:27.030
(machine beeping)

30:27.030 --> 30:27.863
No way.

30:31.671 --> 30:32.504
Proof.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.370
(eerie suspenseful music)

31:24.028 --> 31:26.945
(doorbell ringing)

31:35.314 --> 31:38.462
(knocking at door)

31:38.462 --> 31:41.462
(suspenseful music)

31:49.802 --> 31:50.719
Aunt Wendy?

31:53.640 --> 31:56.473
(phone vibrating)

31:57.780 --> 31:58.613
- Hey, Jamie.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.310
What, slow down.

32:02.310 --> 32:03.610
What happened?

32:03.610 --> 32:05.530
Why are you at my house?

32:05.530 --> 32:06.363
Hang on.

32:15.610 --> 32:16.643
What happened?

32:18.720 --> 32:19.743
I'll be right there.

32:52.650 --> 32:55.150
(eerie music)

33:00.898 --> 33:05.398
(groaning)
(panting)

33:24.396 --> 33:26.979
(storm raging)

33:45.605 --> 33:46.522
Sweetheart.

33:54.623 --> 33:55.730
What happened?

33:55.730 --> 33:57.080
- At first she said one thing,

33:57.080 --> 34:00.450
it was like she just
went completely blank.

34:00.450 --> 34:02.903
She kept saying these two words to me.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.773
Endless cruelties.

34:06.984 --> 34:09.399
And then...

34:09.399 --> 34:13.305
And then she seemed almost
like she couldn't breathe,

34:13.305 --> 34:15.880
then she just started screaming.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.823
It will never end, it will never end.

34:20.970 --> 34:22.290
- Let's get her back into bed.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.123
- Uncle Donald.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.137
What the hell is going on?

34:26.137 --> 34:27.387
- I don't know.

34:29.342 --> 34:30.425
I don't know.

34:39.175 --> 34:40.220
- I've heard of this before.

34:40.220 --> 34:41.053
- What?

34:41.053 --> 34:43.053
- A ritual book like this.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.182
Of course.

34:46.182 --> 34:48.100
It has to be done by a group of people

34:48.100 --> 34:50.358
so the demon can't pray
on them individually.

34:50.358 --> 34:51.191
- Demon.

34:51.191 --> 34:52.024
- Individuals are weak.

34:52.024 --> 34:53.980
These forces can overwhelm a single person

34:53.980 --> 34:54.863
but together.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.670
Look, a triangle.

34:58.670 --> 35:00.880
Three sense divided into three people.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.710
One person to see, another person to hear,

35:02.710 --> 35:03.870
and another person to speak.

35:03.870 --> 35:05.000
- To do what?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.540
- Whatever is attacking at Wendy,

35:06.540 --> 35:08.102
it's been here for a long time.

35:08.102 --> 35:10.700
The people who lived here before you guys,

35:10.700 --> 35:13.163
they were fighting it, too, with this.

35:14.470 --> 35:16.350
Look, the ritual allows you to identify

35:16.350 --> 35:20.090
the demon using these
abilities, okay, these senses.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.740
The book itself gives you a
list of known incantations

35:22.740 --> 35:24.180
to banish the demon.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.160
- I've looked at all of this.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.330
It's nonsense, it's just crazy scribbling.

35:27.330 --> 35:28.910
- No, they're instructions.

35:28.910 --> 35:30.480
- Jamie, you can't possibly believe

35:30.480 --> 35:32.510
that any of this real.

35:32.510 --> 35:33.846
- Of course I do.

35:33.846 --> 35:36.090
Don't you, after what's happened here?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.310
I mean, what more do you need?

35:37.310 --> 35:38.650
- The book is empty.

35:38.650 --> 35:41.910
- No, it's here it's just hidden.

35:41.910 --> 35:42.770
- That doesn't make any sense.

35:42.770 --> 35:43.940
- It does.

35:43.940 --> 35:45.120
This is powerful stuff,

35:45.120 --> 35:46.930
it can be dangerous, too, I'm sure.

35:46.930 --> 35:49.530
- Never should have mentioned it.

35:49.530 --> 35:50.973
- We have to do the ritual.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.580
Me, you, and Charlie.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.840
- No.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.230
- Please let me do this for her.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.260
- No.
- Uncle Donald.

35:58.260 --> 35:59.953
- Absolutely not!

36:03.390 --> 36:04.223
- Fine.

36:05.729 --> 36:08.340
But at least let me stay the night.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.540
It would make me feel
better to be close by.

36:11.940 --> 36:12.773
- Fine.

36:20.568 --> 36:23.485
(knocking at door)

36:24.320 --> 36:25.483
- Hey.
- Hey, Charlie.

36:27.470 --> 36:29.520
- Jamie seemed pretty upset on the phone.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.473
You okay?

36:36.293 --> 36:37.430
Well, where is she?

36:37.430 --> 36:38.780
- Fell asleep on the couch.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.992
- She asked me for stuff.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.740
Got her clothes and a toothbrush.

36:43.740 --> 36:44.573
- Good.

36:47.930 --> 36:49.080
- Can I see Aunt Wendy?

36:50.830 --> 36:51.663
- Sure.

36:57.533 --> 37:00.533
(eerie tense music)

37:11.556 --> 37:12.771
- What the hell?

37:12.771 --> 37:15.190
What happened, what happened to her hand?

37:15.190 --> 37:17.360
- It's kind of a long story.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.700
- We gotta take her to
the hospital or something.

37:19.700 --> 37:22.260
- I took her already, twice.

37:22.260 --> 37:24.140
- And what did they say?

37:24.140 --> 37:25.290
- It's not that simple.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.623
- Did you tell mom?

37:32.788 --> 37:34.330
Look, I don't understand.

37:34.330 --> 37:37.748
What's happening, what are
you not telling me here?

37:37.748 --> 37:41.248
(eerie suspenseful music)

38:01.423 --> 38:04.173
(speaking Latin)

38:17.060 --> 38:19.977
(static crackling)

38:30.037 --> 38:32.954
(doorbell ringing)

38:39.347 --> 38:40.300
- Hi, Nancy.

38:40.300 --> 38:41.133
You're here late.

38:41.133 --> 38:42.320
- Oh, I finished the grading.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.870
I swear these kids
forget what the paper was

38:43.870 --> 38:45.070
about halfway through.

38:45.070 --> 38:46.280
(laughing)

38:46.280 --> 38:49.483
- Listen, Wendy, she's.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.470
She's kinda under the weather.

38:52.470 --> 38:53.303
So, uh.

38:53.303 --> 38:54.670
- I don't want to be rude,

38:54.670 --> 38:56.410
but I have to see her
about something here.

38:56.410 --> 38:57.250
It will only take a minute.

38:57.250 --> 38:58.093
- I don't know.

39:00.025 --> 39:00.858
- Hey.

39:02.130 --> 39:02.963
- Hi.

39:04.730 --> 39:06.570
- Charlie.
- Nancy.

39:06.570 --> 39:07.740
- You work with my aunt?

39:07.740 --> 39:09.330
- Yeah, a graduate assistant.

39:09.330 --> 39:10.900
- Very cool.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.680
You want me to take those for you?

39:12.680 --> 39:13.523
- Yeah, sure.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.610
- Like I said, she's not
going to be able to talk,

39:20.610 --> 39:22.220
she's on some heavy pain medication.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.630
- Oh, geeze, is she okay?

39:24.630 --> 39:26.217
- No.
- Uh.

39:26.217 --> 39:28.133
- I mean, not really.

39:29.180 --> 39:30.700
- Is there anything I can do?

39:30.700 --> 39:34.250
- No, I'm gonna stay
and help out where I can

39:34.250 --> 39:35.893
but I think we're cool.

39:38.170 --> 39:39.220
- That's nice of you.

39:40.410 --> 39:42.640
- Okay, so thank you.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.600
Have a great night, thanks.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.433
Sorry about this

39:44.433 --> 39:46.920
and I'm sure that Wendy's really going

39:46.920 --> 39:48.035
to appreciate all the hard work.

39:48.035 --> 39:51.411
- Oh, no problem, okay.

39:51.411 --> 39:52.974
(gasping)

39:52.974 --> 39:55.100
Um, what, what was that?

39:55.100 --> 39:55.963
- I have no idea.

39:57.414 --> 40:02.414
- I got it.

40:05.190 --> 40:06.023
Come on.

40:06.023 --> 40:07.830
What you got a security
system or something?

40:07.830 --> 40:08.970
- No, we don't have.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.870
- It's not locked, what's wrong with it?

40:14.693 --> 40:16.372
- It's stuck.

40:16.372 --> 40:21.372
(glass cracking)
(power humming)

40:21.800 --> 40:22.633
- Great.

40:29.110 --> 40:31.510
- My phones dead and I
charged it, I know I did.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.190
- Me, too.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.650
- I was gonna use it for the phone light.

40:36.650 --> 40:37.700
- Okay, that's weird.

40:38.560 --> 40:41.620
- Uh, I'm gonna go check
the breaker, I guess.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.720
- I'll check the back.

40:43.763 --> 40:44.763
- I'll come.

40:53.213 --> 40:54.537
- What's it looking like?

40:54.537 --> 40:56.787
All right here, let me try.

41:02.761 --> 41:03.594
Come on.

41:05.236 --> 41:06.403
What the hell?

41:09.971 --> 41:10.804
Uh.

41:12.651 --> 41:13.568
Aunt Wendy?

41:14.514 --> 41:18.274
(Eerie tense music)

41:18.274 --> 41:19.274
Is that you?

41:24.480 --> 41:25.313
Hey.

41:28.970 --> 41:29.803
- Get it open?

41:34.160 --> 41:36.210
- Is there someone else in the house?

41:36.210 --> 41:37.043
- What?

41:37.043 --> 41:37.933
No, it's just us.

41:42.590 --> 41:44.230
- Hey.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.530
So um...

41:47.609 --> 41:50.223
I have to tell you guys something.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.800
- Why didn't you listen to me?

41:55.800 --> 41:57.520
- I had to help her.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.590
You didn't believe in it, so.

41:59.590 --> 42:01.120
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

42:01.120 --> 42:02.210
I just wanted to help her.

42:02.210 --> 42:03.043
- All right, all right.

42:03.043 --> 42:04.150
Can somebody explain to me

42:04.150 --> 42:05.790
what kind of weird shit is happening here?

42:05.790 --> 42:08.523
- Yeah, yeah.

42:10.190 --> 42:12.420
Your Aunt Wendy found
this book in the basement

42:12.420 --> 42:14.950
and since then, weird
stuff has been happening.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.223
- What's in the book?

42:17.210 --> 42:19.670
- A ritual to banish demons.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.430
You need three people to do it.

42:21.430 --> 42:23.630
- Jamie believes that there's something

42:23.630 --> 42:25.400
in the house with us.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.610
- A demonic force.

42:26.610 --> 42:27.473
- Yeah, that.

42:28.950 --> 42:30.680
- I did the ritual.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.880
I was trying to force you guys to do it

42:32.880 --> 42:35.214
by starting it myself, I'm sorry,

42:35.214 --> 42:37.550
and Nancy I'm really sorry to you

42:37.550 --> 42:38.790
because I didn't know you would

42:38.790 --> 42:40.371
be coming over tonight.

42:40.371 --> 42:41.204
- Okay, all right.

42:41.204 --> 42:42.798
So what do we need three people for?

42:42.798 --> 42:45.780
- The book needs you to identify the demon

42:45.780 --> 42:47.800
before you can banish it

42:47.800 --> 42:48.953
and in order to do that,

42:48.953 --> 42:51.543
you need to find the proper incantation.

42:52.550 --> 42:54.800
There's three abilities
divided to three people.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.750
One person to see the demon,

42:56.750 --> 42:58.230
another person to hear the demon,

42:58.230 --> 43:01.110
and another to speak the demon's language.

43:01.110 --> 43:03.120
Show them the book, Uncle Donald.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.100
- Here it is.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.050
We still haven't figured it out, its...

43:09.341 --> 43:10.174
What?

43:12.810 --> 43:13.660
- [Charlie] What?

43:14.720 --> 43:16.293
- No, there's text there now.

43:18.770 --> 43:21.360
In Latin and I can understand it

43:21.360 --> 43:24.863
and I don't speak Latin.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.080
How is this possible?

43:27.080 --> 43:28.560
- It still looks empty to me.

43:28.560 --> 43:29.393
- Me, too.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.350
- That's mean you can speak the language.

43:32.350 --> 43:36.350
So, either Charlie or I can hear

43:36.350 --> 43:37.473
or see the demon.

43:38.490 --> 43:39.340
- You don't know?

43:40.526 --> 43:43.193
(phone ringing)

44:18.900 --> 44:19.733
- Nothing.

44:22.010 --> 44:23.640
- Should we find a flashlight?

44:23.640 --> 44:25.139
- Yeah, there in here.

44:25.139 --> 44:25.972
- I got 'em.

44:25.972 --> 44:27.055
- I'm coming.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.790
- I know they're somewhere in here.

44:52.070 --> 44:52.903
Found one.

44:56.860 --> 44:57.693
Look.

44:59.230 --> 45:01.163
Look, I know this is some weird shit.

45:02.290 --> 45:04.990
But I'm really sorry you
got caught up in this.

45:04.990 --> 45:07.090
- Let's just keep looking for flashlights.

45:26.818 --> 45:28.318
- You okay, Jamie?

45:30.860 --> 45:32.410
- I have this terrible feeling.

45:34.107 --> 45:34.940
- What?

45:36.966 --> 45:39.216
- Like we're being watched.

45:46.330 --> 45:47.680
I think somethings in here.

45:49.870 --> 45:50.703
- In here?

45:53.290 --> 45:54.133
Can you see it?

45:56.820 --> 45:57.720
- I see something.

46:04.303 --> 46:06.970
(phone ringing)

46:10.166 --> 46:12.416
- I'm getting it this time.

46:15.726 --> 46:18.907
(ethereal screeching)

46:18.907 --> 46:21.740
(static cracking)

46:23.905 --> 46:27.405
(eerie suspenseful music)

46:29.467 --> 46:31.888
(panting)

46:31.888 --> 46:33.805
- Charlie, what was it?

46:35.805 --> 46:36.941
(object clattering)

46:36.941 --> 46:39.358
- That came from the kitchen.

46:42.726 --> 46:44.667
(high pitched whirring)

46:44.667 --> 46:45.889
(shushing)

46:45.889 --> 46:49.222
(high pitched whirring)

46:51.665 --> 46:55.165
(eerie suspenseful music)

47:00.612 --> 47:02.184
What the hell?

47:02.184 --> 47:04.434
- What's going on, Charlie?

47:05.313 --> 47:06.606
- Did you guys hear that?

47:06.606 --> 47:08.166
- What?

47:08.166 --> 47:10.510
I don't hear anything.

47:10.510 --> 47:12.080
- Neither do I.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.280
- I think I'm hearing
things you guys can't.

47:15.560 --> 47:16.613
- Where's Jamie?

47:26.070 --> 47:26.903
- Jamie?

47:28.367 --> 47:29.243
You okay?

47:31.400 --> 47:32.233
- Right there.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.163
Can you see that?

47:40.580 --> 47:41.413
I can see.

47:43.530 --> 47:44.400
I can see.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.800
That means Charlie can hear.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.343
- [Donald] What do you see?

47:50.049 --> 47:53.153
- Like a symbol.

47:54.750 --> 47:55.850
- What kind of symbol?

47:57.510 --> 47:58.343
(eerie tense music)

47:58.343 --> 47:59.453
- Maybe a warning.

48:03.410 --> 48:04.513
It won't go away.

48:06.860 --> 48:08.093
I can see it everywhere.

48:09.210 --> 48:10.043
- It's okay.

48:10.043 --> 48:11.846
- I can see it when I close my eyes.

48:11.846 --> 48:14.545
- It's okay, it's okay.

48:14.545 --> 48:15.378
Just sit down.

48:15.378 --> 48:16.262
It's okay.

48:16.262 --> 48:17.530
It's gonna be okay.

48:17.530 --> 48:19.140
- [Nancy] Maybe she can
trace on a piece of paper?

48:19.140 --> 48:20.830
- [Donald] That's a good idea.

48:20.830 --> 48:23.153
Look on the shelf, see if there's a pen.

48:23.153 --> 48:24.990
You think you could recreate it?

48:24.990 --> 48:25.990
- Yeah.

48:25.990 --> 48:28.990
(eerie tense music)

50:11.428 --> 50:13.595
(panting)

50:14.708 --> 50:15.541
- Oh fuck.

50:16.505 --> 50:18.672
(panting)

51:36.315 --> 51:38.982
(wood creaking)

52:11.058 --> 52:14.575
(blood dripping)

52:14.575 --> 52:17.575
(eerie tense music)

52:25.155 --> 52:28.055
(muffled panting)

52:28.055 --> 52:31.055
(eerie tense music)

52:45.293 --> 52:47.460
(heaving)

52:49.615 --> 52:52.615
(eerie tense music)

53:00.592 --> 53:03.943
- What happened?

53:03.943 --> 53:05.284
Charlie, what happened?

53:05.284 --> 53:06.563
What happened to you?

53:09.226 --> 53:11.638
- You, you don't want to know.

53:11.638 --> 53:14.020
(objects thudding)

53:14.020 --> 53:14.853
Upstairs.

53:14.853 --> 53:16.040
- [Donald] Upstairs what?

53:18.040 --> 53:20.250
- There's footsteps coming from upstairs.

53:20.250 --> 53:21.460
- Wendy, we gotta go check on Wendy.

53:21.460 --> 53:22.293
Go, go.

53:23.476 --> 53:24.513
- Uncle Donald.

53:24.513 --> 53:27.203
That thing you said to me earlier,

53:28.200 --> 53:29.193
the pale blue dot.

53:30.380 --> 53:31.213
Thank you.

53:31.213 --> 53:33.030
- Gonna be okay, Charlie.

53:33.030 --> 53:33.863
Come on.

53:34.974 --> 53:37.141
(panting)

53:42.606 --> 53:43.439
- Stop.

53:45.370 --> 53:47.120
I think there's something in there.

53:49.267 --> 53:51.767
(eerie music)

53:55.270 --> 53:57.820
(static crackling)

53:57.820 --> 53:59.089
- Shit.

53:59.089 --> 54:00.491
- It's right there.

54:00.491 --> 54:01.333
- It's okay.

54:01.333 --> 54:02.303
It's okay.

54:04.300 --> 54:05.490
- I don't hear it.

54:05.490 --> 54:06.383
- I can't see it.

54:07.690 --> 54:09.610
Jamie, can you describe it?

54:09.610 --> 54:10.443
What do you see?

54:12.430 --> 54:13.263
- I don't know.

54:13.263 --> 54:14.096
- Just try.

54:15.410 --> 54:19.113
- Thin long man in robes.

54:20.810 --> 54:21.860
- [Donald] What else?

54:24.396 --> 54:26.640
- They're tattered robes.

54:26.640 --> 54:29.041
Um just tall, very tall.

54:29.041 --> 54:30.663
Like almost like a shadow.

54:32.278 --> 54:33.111
- Nothing.

54:35.845 --> 54:38.845
(eerie tense music)

55:04.237 --> 55:05.070
(screaming)

55:05.070 --> 55:06.233
- Donald.

55:06.233 --> 55:07.780
Donald!

55:07.780 --> 55:08.613
Come on.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.265
- Charlie, open the door.

55:12.265 --> 55:13.190
- Donald.
- Charlie.

55:13.190 --> 55:14.483
- Donald!

55:14.483 --> 55:15.316
- All right.

55:15.316 --> 55:16.907
I'll find a way out.
- Jamie.

55:16.907 --> 55:17.984
Jamie.

55:17.984 --> 55:18.817
Jamie, come here.

55:18.817 --> 55:19.650
Look, I can't hear the sounds

55:19.650 --> 55:20.483
and I can't see it.

55:20.483 --> 55:22.100
You gotta tell me where it is, all right?

55:22.100 --> 55:23.467
Please, just breathe through it.

55:23.467 --> 55:24.886
Breathe through.

55:24.886 --> 55:26.240
What do you see?

55:26.240 --> 55:27.403
What do you see?

55:27.403 --> 55:29.903
(eerie music)

55:48.962 --> 55:49.962
- Oh my god.

55:52.096 --> 55:53.016
- Charlie!

55:53.016 --> 55:53.849
- Jamie.

55:55.040 --> 55:58.040
(ethereal trilling)

55:59.848 --> 56:00.681
- Jamie!

56:00.681 --> 56:02.181
Jamie, I'm coming.

56:04.068 --> 56:05.471
(grunting)

56:05.471 --> 56:06.916
- No, no, no.

56:06.916 --> 56:08.257
I can't get it.

56:08.257 --> 56:09.254
- [Charlie] Go get Jamie.

56:09.254 --> 56:10.087
- Okay.

56:10.087 --> 56:10.920
- [Charlie] Just don't let her...

56:10.920 --> 56:12.267
- I'm going to go get something.

56:12.267 --> 56:14.350
Okay, I got it, I got it.

56:24.307 --> 56:26.584
- Door, the door, come on.

56:26.584 --> 56:28.501
How do I open the door?

56:41.690 --> 56:43.857
(gasping)

56:45.328 --> 56:47.578
(grunting)

56:50.384 --> 56:52.634
(grunting)

56:57.421 --> 57:02.421
(wet crunching)
(screaming)

57:03.224 --> 57:06.224
(eerie tense music)

57:20.615 --> 57:23.365
(drill whirring)

57:35.533 --> 57:40.260
(screaming)
(wet crunching)

57:40.260 --> 57:41.093
- Charlie!

57:42.260 --> 57:45.260
(eerie tense music)

57:55.662 --> 57:56.579
Aunt Wendy?

58:47.524 --> 58:50.191
(door creaking)

58:57.276 --> 58:58.953
(shouting)
(tense music)

58:58.953 --> 59:00.118
(screaming)

59:00.118 --> 59:03.118
(muffled screaming)

59:04.651 --> 59:07.651
(eerie tense music)

59:22.208 --> 59:23.041
- Charlie.

59:24.162 --> 59:26.010
Oh, oh Jesus.

59:26.010 --> 59:26.843
Come on.

59:26.843 --> 59:27.940
- My fucking shoulder hurts.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.023
- Okay, okay.

59:30.753 --> 59:32.260
You get Jamie, get Jamie.

59:32.260 --> 59:34.000
I'll get Nancy.
- Help.

59:34.000 --> 59:34.833
Help me!
- Nancy.

59:36.103 --> 59:37.405
Nancy.
- Please help me!

59:37.405 --> 59:39.487
Please help me!

59:39.487 --> 59:40.767
(shouting)

59:40.767 --> 59:43.028
(screaming)
(wet crunching)

59:43.028 --> 59:44.031
- Okay, okay, it's okay.

59:44.031 --> 59:45.385
It's okay.

59:45.385 --> 59:46.468
It's okay.

59:46.468 --> 59:48.047
It's gonna be okay.

59:48.047 --> 59:49.120
(sobbing)

59:49.120 --> 59:50.960
I'm gonna get something
to stop the bleeding.

59:50.960 --> 59:53.127
(sobbing)

59:57.463 --> 59:58.296
- Jamie.

1:00:10.354 --> 1:00:11.187
Jamie?

1:00:19.195 --> 1:00:20.028
Jamie.

1:00:24.693 --> 1:00:27.056
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

1:00:27.056 --> 1:00:28.723
We're gonna be okay.

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:42.690
The book says the candle will burn red

1:00:42.690 --> 1:00:45.000
if Wendy's soul is taken.

1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.310
- Do we know what the demon is yet?

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:47.410
- [Charlie] I know what it sounds like.

1:00:47.410 --> 1:00:48.620
- What?

1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:50.390
- [Charlie] I hear a low
pitched hum when it's near.

1:00:50.390 --> 1:00:51.568
I know that.
- Okay.

1:00:51.568 --> 1:00:52.401
All right.
- But I don't

1:00:52.401 --> 1:00:53.234
hear it every time.

1:00:53.234 --> 1:00:54.067
- [Donald] What do you mean?

1:00:54.067 --> 1:00:55.260
- [Charlie] I mean, it was right next

1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:56.790
to us upstairs and I didn't hear a thing.

1:00:56.790 --> 1:00:58.100
- [Nancy] So it doesn't hum all the time?

1:00:58.100 --> 1:00:58.933
- [Charlie] Right.

1:00:58.933 --> 1:01:00.450
- Uh, a voice, a voice.

1:01:00.450 --> 1:01:01.500
Maybe you don't hear it all the time

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.110
because sometimes it's a voice?

1:01:03.110 --> 1:01:04.584
- What about what Jamie saw?

1:01:04.584 --> 1:01:07.980
- She said it was a
tall, thin man in robes.

1:01:07.980 --> 1:01:08.984
- There's something like that here.

1:01:08.984 --> 1:01:12.380
Tall, tattered robes.

1:01:12.380 --> 1:01:14.750
Low religious chant.

1:01:14.750 --> 1:01:16.323
The name of the demon--

1:01:16.323 --> 1:01:18.216
(screaming)

1:01:18.216 --> 1:01:19.049
- Jamie!

1:01:19.049 --> 1:01:19.882
Jamie.

1:01:19.882 --> 1:01:21.144
(shouting)

1:01:21.144 --> 1:01:22.173
Jamie!

1:01:22.173 --> 1:01:24.540
(groaning)

1:01:24.540 --> 1:01:27.540
(eerie tense music)

1:01:28.757 --> 1:01:29.674
We can't leave him.

1:01:29.674 --> 1:01:31.190
- We need to worry about getting ourselves

1:01:31.190 --> 1:01:32.590
out of here right now, okay?

1:01:33.599 --> 1:01:37.182
(distant booming thudding)

1:01:50.862 --> 1:01:53.362
(eerie music)

1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:08.427
(wood creaking)

1:02:08.427 --> 1:02:13.427
(eerie music)
(booming thudding)

1:03:02.475 --> 1:03:07.475
(grunting)
(wet crunching)

1:03:11.956 --> 1:03:14.206
(gurgling)

1:03:33.579 --> 1:03:36.246
(door creaking)

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:51.743
- Donald?

1:03:58.990 --> 1:03:59.823
Donald?

1:04:02.540 --> 1:04:03.373
Screw this.

1:04:07.578 --> 1:04:08.995
Hey, I gotcha ya.

1:04:09.922 --> 1:04:11.300
Hey, hey, hey.

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:12.133
It's okay, it's okay.

1:04:12.133 --> 1:04:12.966
We gotta keep pressure on it.

1:04:12.966 --> 1:04:14.084
We gotta keep pressure on it.

1:04:14.084 --> 1:04:15.204
It's fine, it's fine, it's okay.

1:04:15.204 --> 1:04:16.037
- Charlie, this--

1:04:16.037 --> 1:04:17.040
- You're gonna be fine.

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:18.300
- You have to use the book to banish it.

1:04:18.300 --> 1:04:19.750
- What are you talking about?

1:04:21.097 --> 1:04:22.400
- Its name, I know its name.

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.060
- What, it doesn't matter.

1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:25.082
It doesn't matter.

1:04:25.082 --> 1:04:27.505
- The name is Sullumeg.

1:04:27.505 --> 1:04:28.338
- What?

1:04:30.630 --> 1:04:31.463
No, no, no.

1:04:31.463 --> 1:04:33.083
We need to keep pressure on it, stop.

1:04:34.443 --> 1:04:35.782
What are you doing?

1:04:35.782 --> 1:04:36.704
- Listen to me.

1:04:36.704 --> 1:04:38.497
Listen to me.

1:04:38.497 --> 1:04:40.520
You're gonna need all my blood to do it.

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:42.445
It won't work without it.

1:04:42.445 --> 1:04:43.610
(sobbing)

1:04:43.610 --> 1:04:44.443
Charlie.

1:04:46.790 --> 1:04:48.090
Hey, remember.

1:04:48.090 --> 1:04:49.923
Hey, hey.

1:04:50.822 --> 1:04:51.663
Look at me.

1:04:53.956 --> 1:04:55.806
You remember about the pale blue dot?

1:04:57.363 --> 1:05:00.737
It's all, it's all just a vast darkness

1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:05.523
and this is just one little speck.

1:05:09.339 --> 1:05:10.172
- Donald?

1:05:12.045 --> 1:05:12.878
Donald?

1:05:13.900 --> 1:05:15.421
Uncle Donald, Donald, Donald.

1:05:15.421 --> 1:05:16.338
Look at me.

1:05:17.190 --> 1:05:18.053
Please wake up.

1:05:21.288 --> 1:05:24.288
(eerie tense music)

1:05:26.205 --> 1:05:27.923
- It's okay, Jamie.

1:05:27.923 --> 1:05:29.624
It's okay, it's okay.

1:05:29.624 --> 1:05:31.791
(sobbing)

1:05:36.783 --> 1:05:40.283
(eerie suspenseful music)

1:05:41.894 --> 1:05:42.970
- I hear it.

1:05:42.970 --> 1:05:44.120
Downstairs, we have to go now.

1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:45.987
- What?
- He gave me his name.

1:05:45.987 --> 1:05:47.200
- What do we do?

1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:48.050
- We do it again.

1:05:49.250 --> 1:05:50.200
This time with you.

1:05:52.626 --> 1:05:55.126
(eerie music)

1:06:01.807 --> 1:06:02.640
Hurry!

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:03.940
(speaking Latin)
Come on.

1:06:05.284 --> 1:06:08.034
(speaking Latin)

1:06:10.430 --> 1:06:11.263
- I can read it.

1:06:12.110 --> 1:06:12.943
I can read it.

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:15.800
- It's there.

1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:17.508
- Charlie, watch out.

1:06:17.508 --> 1:06:22.508
(eerie music)
(electricity crackling)

1:06:28.275 --> 1:06:29.335
Charlie.

1:06:29.335 --> 1:06:30.811
Charlie.

1:06:30.811 --> 1:06:35.811
(eerie music)
(electricity crackling)

1:06:37.675 --> 1:06:38.694
Don't do it yet, Nancy.

1:06:38.694 --> 1:06:40.192
Wait until it gets closer.

1:06:40.192 --> 1:06:41.237
- What, what about Charlie?

1:06:41.237 --> 1:06:43.038
- We have and wait until it gets closer.

1:06:43.038 --> 1:06:44.037
- We have to do it.

1:06:44.037 --> 1:06:45.536
- Nancy, just wait.

1:06:45.536 --> 1:06:50.536
(eerie music)
(electricity crackling)

1:06:58.847 --> 1:07:00.680
Now, Nancy, do it now.

1:07:01.931 --> 1:07:04.931
(speaking in Latin)

1:07:38.590 --> 1:07:39.523
- Her fevers gone.

1:07:46.054 --> 1:07:47.613
- You're probably better off down here.

1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:51.430
This whole fucking house
gives me the creeps.

1:07:55.330 --> 1:07:56.530
- I hope she'll be okay.

1:07:58.450 --> 1:07:59.283
- Me, too.

1:08:16.090 --> 1:08:16.923
Yeah?

1:08:16.923 --> 1:08:17.947
- I'm sorry about Donald.

1:08:24.755 --> 1:08:26.930
What should we do with this?

1:08:26.930 --> 1:08:28.050
- Burn it.

1:08:28.050 --> 1:08:28.883
- Sounds good.

1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:39.690
I thought the effects of the ritual

1:08:39.690 --> 1:08:41.020
were supposed to wear off.

1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:41.900
- [Charlie] I don't know.

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:42.733
Why?

1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:45.945
- 'Cause I can still read it.

1:08:45.945 --> 1:08:46.778
- What?

1:08:51.631 --> 1:08:52.464
Gemullus.

1:08:54.330 --> 1:08:55.163
We had it wrong.

1:08:55.163 --> 1:08:56.815
It's Gemullus.

1:08:56.815 --> 1:08:57.833
- What do you mean?

1:08:59.350 --> 1:09:01.370
- The book, it gave us the word

1:09:01.370 --> 1:09:03.150
but it was backwards.

1:09:03.150 --> 1:09:04.450
- [Charlie] What?

1:09:04.450 --> 1:09:06.050
- It gave us Gemullus,

1:09:06.050 --> 1:09:08.253
which means twin in Latin.

1:09:10.130 --> 1:09:14.809
Um, it says some demons
come in identical pairs

1:09:14.809 --> 1:09:17.240
and they are impossible to tell apart

1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:20.343
based on looks on alone
and harder to banish.

1:09:22.740 --> 1:09:24.970
It's saying the only way to distinguish

1:09:24.970 --> 1:09:29.080
the two demons is by
the tone of their voice.

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:31.070
One demon has a low pitched voice,

1:09:31.070 --> 1:09:31.903
the other has--

1:09:31.903 --> 1:09:32.736
- A pitched one.

1:09:34.610 --> 1:09:36.180
- Yeah.

1:09:36.180 --> 1:09:37.013
You heard that?

1:09:37.013 --> 1:09:37.846
You heard two demons?

1:09:37.846 --> 1:09:39.770
- I don't know, maybe.

1:09:39.770 --> 1:09:42.640
- In order to banish two identical demons,

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:45.680
the same incantation
has to be read forward

1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:47.010
and in reverse.

1:09:47.010 --> 1:09:48.550
Or one of the demons will remain,

1:09:48.550 --> 1:09:50.350
tethered to the world of the living.

1:09:51.260 --> 1:09:54.543
One of them will be in our world forever.

1:09:59.080 --> 1:09:59.993
We did it wrong.

1:10:04.030 --> 1:10:04.883
- Where's Jamie?

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:08.633
- You look down here.

1:10:08.633 --> 1:10:09.780
I'll look upstairs.
- Jamie!

1:10:10.857 --> 1:10:11.690
Jamie!

1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:15.273
Jamie.

1:10:19.135 --> 1:10:22.687
(distant screaming)

1:10:22.687 --> 1:10:25.020
(screaming)

1:10:28.782 --> 1:10:33.782
(wet crunching)
(eerie tense music)

1:10:37.850 --> 1:10:41.923
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:10:41.923 --> 1:10:46.923
(wet crunching)
(eerie tense music)

1:10:52.470 --> 1:10:53.840
Jamie.

1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:54.673
Jamie!

1:10:56.323 --> 1:10:57.593
What the fuck did you do?

1:11:00.982 --> 1:11:01.815
Huh?

1:11:01.815 --> 1:11:03.898
What the fuck did you do?

1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:42.545
- Jamie?

1:11:42.545 --> 1:11:46.045
(eerie suspenseful music)
