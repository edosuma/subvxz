00:29.720 --> 00:31.160
Hello, police?

00:31.240 --> 00:33.720
There's been a shooting in the museum.
Send someone, please.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.000
Okay. We'll take care of it.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.640
Dispatch, all units to the museum.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.200
-There's been a shooting at the museum.
-We're on it.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.640
Say again. Where was it?

02:00.400 --> 02:02.520
Let go of me! My friend's in there!

02:02.600 --> 02:03.800
I'll let you go, asshole.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.320
Guys, what the hell?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
Where did you find him?

02:08.440 --> 02:10.479
At the crime scene. Who are you?

02:12.240 --> 02:16.240
-If you want to talk to me, take it off.
-Okay.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
-You know what happened?
-No.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.240
See? Neither do I. But he does.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.080
So be a peach
and watch him while we look around.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.600
Okay, guys. Wrap it up.
Dempsey and Makepeace, take over.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.160
Funny guy.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.360
Put him in their car.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.640
No, I don't wanna.
You'll mess up my uniform.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.720
I'll mess up your face.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.840
MUSEUM MASSACRE

03:00.480 --> 03:01.800
How does this sound?

03:02.600 --> 03:07.120
"He struggled helplessly
in the iron grip of the SWAT team."

03:07.200 --> 03:08.680
Awesome.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.480
Mr. Angalai, you like it?

03:12.240 --> 03:13.280
What do you mean?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.800
I'm not just a cop, see?
I'm also a writer.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.960
Something I could've read?

03:18.040 --> 03:20.320
-I don't wanna brag--
-You do!

03:20.400 --> 03:24.000
I wrote a book of some success,
and I'm working on another.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.880
I see.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.680
They only write about us Gypsies
in the papers.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.600
And mostly just bad things.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.240
Can we turn the siren on?

03:34.040 --> 03:37.000
No. We do that
only when the law allows it.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.680
Right. And what if I wrote this:

03:40.760 --> 03:45.600
"The SWAT team
mercilessly and ruthlessly--"

03:58.480 --> 04:00.440
Don't just stand there. Shut the door.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.120
Yes, sir.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
Hey. Hey!

04:05.600 --> 04:07.160
Get back inside.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.600
-But I--
-Sit right there.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.720
-Here?
-There.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.720
So, when will you beat me?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.920
We should apologize for the SWAT team.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.760
It's okay. They were just doing their job.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.240
Have some, Gabo.
You mind if I call you Gabo?

04:42.760 --> 04:43.840
That's my name.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.600
May I have a smoke?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.320
No smoking in here.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.520
What happened at the museum?

04:52.200 --> 04:53.680
I don't know. I wasn't even there.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.520
Mr. Angalai, we found you there.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.400
You are our only witness.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.560
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.720
Try us.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.320
And record.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.320
Not that one. The red circle.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.320
Like that.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.240
It all started with a manhole cover.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.080
Bro, help me.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.520
Man, that's heavy.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.640
-At least 50 kilos.
-Might even be a hundred.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.040
-Shut up.
-You shut up.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.440
Moron.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.400
-Hold him.
-I'll knock him the fuck out!

05:47.280 --> 05:49.920
Let's go, or we'll get it too.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.600
The boys took it home.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.360
To clean it, you know?

06:01.880 --> 06:06.680
Gabo, you sure they weren't stealing it?

06:07.280 --> 06:10.840
What for? They're good boys, mostly.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.960
And they put it back.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.440
-That's when we found him--
-All right. Please focus.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.480
Forget the cover.
What happened in the museum?

06:20.560 --> 06:22.360
-But I'm trying--
-No.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.840
No, we're the ones
asking the questions here.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.000
So let's start with Ladislav Hundel.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.440
-Hunder.
-Der? Hunder?

06:30.520 --> 06:33.360
Lacko? He's my best friend.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.480
A great man. He's just got a short fuse.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.360
But he can repair anything,
so he can't be a bad person.

06:43.880 --> 06:44.880
Now this, and…

06:45.960 --> 06:47.960
The city's a mess.

06:48.040 --> 06:52.440
Public money is being stolen,
key people are incompetent.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.040
And Gypsies, they roam free.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.520
We need to tidy up.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
That's right.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.840
Give me four years.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.480
One term is all I need.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.960
If in four years,
our hero, General Milan R. Štefánik,

07:07.040 --> 07:09.640
created our republic, then I…

07:11.000 --> 07:12.320
What the f--

07:16.800 --> 07:18.120
I do it for the people…

07:18.200 --> 07:20.600
Marky, can you turn it down?

07:22.720 --> 07:25.720
Marky! Turn it down, please!

07:28.560 --> 07:30.920
-Turn it down!
-Lacko, don't yell again.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.640
Me? I'm quiet all day.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.520
-His stereo yells like crazy.
-Your TV is also really loud.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.800
But I'm working, my dear.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.000
If you'd rather fix my sewing machine…

07:46.080 --> 07:49.520
Damn it. I told you
some things can't be fixed. Period.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.000
This thing too. It's all fucked up.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.120
Anything can be fixed.
You just need to try.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.080
Lunch is almost ready.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.080
So what?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.840
We should have lunch as a family.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.840
We each do our part.
You cook, and I work, okay?

08:21.240 --> 08:23.520
Turn it off! Turn it off!

08:23.600 --> 08:24.760
Stop yelling!

08:24.840 --> 08:28.960
You know what's yelling? This is yelling!

08:29.840 --> 08:31.760
This is yelling!

08:35.440 --> 08:36.440
Turn it off!

08:37.600 --> 08:38.880
You crazy?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.000
One's not enough!

08:40.080 --> 08:41.559
Who do you think you are?

08:41.640 --> 08:45.640
Mom, Dad's losing it again!
Come get that psycho!

08:47.120 --> 08:49.000
-You do as I say.
-Fuck you.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.160
Fuck who?

08:50.240 --> 08:54.240
See? This is your fault.
You know how he'll end up?

08:54.320 --> 08:56.560
Don't worry. I'll be a break dancer.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.800
You're not a dancer.
You're just a prancer.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.560
Who will pay you for spasming like that?

09:04.640 --> 09:07.520
Anything is better than being a janitor.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.520
You shithead! I'll kill you!

10:16.400 --> 10:18.120
Are you insane?

10:18.640 --> 10:20.440
Do we have to live like this?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.960
Go get him!

10:22.040 --> 10:24.120
-He'll be back.
-Shut up!

10:27.280 --> 10:31.920
You bring our son back right now,
or I will never speak to you again.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.160
Never!

10:36.160 --> 10:40.360
And then she told him,
"I will never speak to you again. Never!"

10:45.200 --> 10:47.480
Lacko is still very sorry about it.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.040
But that happens in a family.
Even with you white people.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.920
Mr. Angalai,
you're starting to piss me off.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.320
That also happens.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.000
My colleague is trying to say,

11:03.080 --> 11:06.320
we're not really interested in
the family issues of Mr. Hunder.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.840
But he asked about him.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.160
But how does that have
anything to do with the museum?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.760
Well, Lacko works at the museum.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.320
He rode there on a bike,
and he was great at cycling.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.040
And he had a great bike.
I'm surprised no one stole it.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.760
He always came to work,
at the museum, on time.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.840
And he knew how to fix everything.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.080
Really everything. He knew all the tricks.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.160
Thanks.

11:49.200 --> 11:53.120
They have great stuff at the museum.
Even from the Winnetou era.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.000
Twenty-five taxidermy animals.

11:56.080 --> 12:02.880
And now we move to
the greatest Slovak hero,

12:02.960 --> 12:05.440
Milan Rastislav Štefánik.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.880
Kids, your teacher told me
you learned about him.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.120
So, what can you tell me?

12:12.200 --> 12:15.120
Excuse me, do those guns actually fire?

12:15.720 --> 12:18.880
No, don't worry.
Nobody's going to fire these.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.400
It would require a lot of work.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.560
But let's go back to
Milan Rastislav Štefánik.

12:27.640 --> 12:33.200
Kids, did you know this is his actual hat?

12:46.280 --> 12:50.440
Mr. Hunder? I knew it was you.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.760
Do you have a lot to do today?

12:53.280 --> 12:55.760
Don't get electrocuted.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.880
That would be a miracle
since it's unplugged.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.120
You know these things better than me.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.680
That's why I need your handy hands.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.920
Can't you see I'm busy?

13:05.000 --> 13:09.960
You'll do this in no time.
This is easy-peasy, a tiny little thing.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.280
Oh, my, a BR-18. I know how to fix this.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.920
-Cogs and gears.
-Yes, it has cogs.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
-It's my grandson's.
-I see that.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.160
He did something.

13:21.240 --> 13:25.400
Dropped it, I don't know.
Now it rattles and doesn't work.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.960
It's the rotor or the axle.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.560
-Can you fix it?
-I just said I can.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.120
Because he's upset.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.880
I spanked his butt.
But that's educational sometimes, right?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.560
You think you can bribe him?

13:37.640 --> 13:42.080
You'd be surprised how well it works.
And not just with kids.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.200
That's also broken?

13:45.280 --> 13:48.880
It's cherry pie. It'll fix you.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.840
It's not easy working on an empty stomach.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.920
I have to go now.
We have two more schools.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.600
It's a full house today.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.760
-That's really fascinating.
-Watch out for pits.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.520
-I know how eating works.
-And I didn't see that beer.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.560
I'm Eduard Kot.
Independent mayor candidate.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.000
Vote number five.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.000
I'll get this city back on its feet.
I'll end the corruption.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.280
You can trust me. I am not a politician.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.560
I'm working for the people,
with competence, decency and honesty.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.400
I bring a solution for the Gypsy problem.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.640
Gypsies must obey the law
like everyone else.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.560
The city votes number five.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.680
I'm the other mayoral candidate…

14:54.760 --> 14:56.080
Hello, Zdena. It's me.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.960
Is Marek home? Zdena?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
Zdena?

15:01.960 --> 15:02.960
Zdena!

15:03.840 --> 15:07.960
Zdena, stop playing this stupid game!
I can hear you breathing!

15:13.200 --> 15:14.560
Laci, can you help me?

15:16.800 --> 15:18.440
Can't you see I'm busy?

15:26.280 --> 15:29.920
Lacko was always eager to help anyone.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.520
Mr. Angalai, please focus.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.080
Why was Mr. Hunder
at the museum that night?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.960
Because they stole his family.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.680
Hi.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.520
What's with the luggage?

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
What?

16:03.080 --> 16:04.480
What's for dinner?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.520
What?

16:09.920 --> 16:11.440
You wanna starve me to death?

16:17.040 --> 16:18.040
Zdena, where's my dinner?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.200
WHERE'S MAREK?

16:35.280 --> 16:36.280
How should I know?

16:37.920 --> 16:40.720
Are you dumb? You had a stroke or what?

16:43.800 --> 16:46.200
We're not even talking anymore?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.600
GOING TO MY SISTER'S.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
Are you crazy?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.560
Zdena?

17:09.119 --> 17:10.119
Zdena.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.119
She slammed the door and left.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.680
And Lacko ended up all alone.

17:22.760 --> 17:23.800
Gabo, stop.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.280
If his wife left, it's his own fault.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.640
But he wanted to fix everything.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.880
Mr. Angalai, I am begging you.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.280
Tell us step-by-step.
What did Mr. Hunder do?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.120
First, he took a newspaper.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.600
Then he found the ad to buy a new stereo.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.440
Hello, I'd like a stereo for my son.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.640
Sold already? I see.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.840
Okay, never mind. I understand. Bye.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.120
Hello, this is Hunder.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.000
Yes, I heard that. I need a big one.
150 Watts is not enough.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.120
Cut the crap. Got the stereo?

18:03.200 --> 18:05.200
No? Bye-bye.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.480
Good evening. It's Hunder.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.880
I'm very interested in your stereo
for my son.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.640
A good boy. I love him.

18:19.760 --> 18:26.280
Hello? Hunder. I need sound. Stereo.
Got the right number?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.360
HOME VIDEO RENTALS

18:27.440 --> 18:30.120
You got it? Great!

18:30.200 --> 18:32.040
I'll come and pick it up.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.000
What do you mean when? Right away.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.040
Okay, thanks. See you.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.120
We do the shoot, you do the tapes. Deal?

19:00.680 --> 19:02.760
Give me Honza, please.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.080
Hey, man. It's all set.

19:07.160 --> 19:11.240
See you in Prague, bro.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.000
-Hello.
-What?

19:14.080 --> 19:15.520
It's about the ad.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.000
But the shoot is tomorrow.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.680
And I wouldn't even use you as an extra.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.720
You're selling a stereo, right?

19:21.800 --> 19:27.320
The stereo. Why didn't you say so?
Got the dough?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.240
-What?
-Cash.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.800
The money? I do.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.560
-Awesome.
-Have it on me.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.640
Great. A friend has the stereo.
I'll take you there.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.000
-But you drive me home.
-First class, bro.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.440
And where are we going?

19:45.520 --> 19:46.760
To the community.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.080
No way, man. Ain't dealing with Gypsies.
Can't stand 'em.

19:50.160 --> 19:55.800
No, man, no Gypsies.
It's a garden community.

19:55.880 --> 20:00.200
You look like a gardener yourself.
Plums, apples…

20:00.280 --> 20:02.080
Anything liquid, right?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.920
Sometimes I drink a glass. Or two.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.720
-Final destination, boss. Get out.
-What?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.200
You're here about the stereo.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.200
-Where is it?
-Come on, man. Come.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.240
Got the money?

20:55.320 --> 20:56.440
Sure.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.160
Give it to me. I'll count it.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.040
The ad said Hi-Fi stereo

21:14.120 --> 21:17.760
with a CD changer,
massive speakers, great sound.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
This is some cheap shit. What the hell?

21:20.600 --> 21:22.120
-You don't like it?
-No way.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
But it's top stuff from East Germany.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.680
They call it die bombe.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.760
Listen to this.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.600
What are you doing?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.680
That's not the stereo.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.120
It's him.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.920
-It's him!
-Wait, I'll switch stations. Watch.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.880
-Loveliest place in the world
-Amazing sound.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.080
-Is my homeland
-You think I'm retarded?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.160
You do?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.880
I tell you what, boys.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.840
You either cough up a stereo

22:17.240 --> 22:18.960
worthy of my son,

22:19.600 --> 22:20.720
or give me my money back.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.360
You think I'll shit myself?

22:23.440 --> 22:24.760
Well, you'd better.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.360
Get lost.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.640
-Take a walk.
-I will sue you and you and you.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.520
-Say what?
-Don't touch me.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.880
-Get out of here.
-Fucking snitch.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
-Walk.
-Get off me.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.480
-He's yelling at me. What the fuck?
-You fucking illiterate!

22:39.560 --> 22:41.960
-What?
-You think you're Mr. Music, you clown?

22:42.040 --> 22:43.680
-Away!
-I'll cut you!

22:43.760 --> 22:46.040
-Come get me!
-Come on!

22:46.120 --> 22:48.640
-Hold him!
-Knock him the fuck out.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.720
Okay. Get rid of him.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.280
So Hunder trashed his son's stereo,
his wife left him.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.440
He wanted to make up.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.680
He found the ad. He got the money.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.040
That's right.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.120
But he got tricked
and dumped into a sewer.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.840
He was fucking lucky someone found him.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.480
Who found him anyway?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.920
We did. I tried to tell you.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.560
-You did? When?
-When you interrupted me.

23:21.160 --> 23:27.880
Anicka, my sister,
kindly asked us to take the cover back.

23:27.960 --> 23:32.320
Am I not doing enough?
Don't I cook enough? Is it not enough?

23:32.400 --> 23:35.520
We only borrowed it.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.120
I'll borrow you one!

23:37.720 --> 23:40.640
Holy Mary, can you see? Why me?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.200
We're sorry.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.560
And speak Slovak!
I told you a hundred times!

23:45.640 --> 23:46.960
-Hi, Gabo.
-Hi, Gabo.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.120
Anicka, what's this?

23:49.200 --> 23:52.000
I told you to watch them.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.400
-I did.
-Liar!

23:54.480 --> 23:57.560
You'll return it right now.
And no dinner for you.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.680
But it's dark outside.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.960
You know where it's dark?

24:00.600 --> 24:03.320
In jail. So scram!

24:03.400 --> 24:05.360
Go! Now!

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Come on. Move it.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.320
Why don't you carry it?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.680
Wasn't too heavy when you stole it.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.440
Ouch, my feet.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.120
It's easy for you.
I'm the one carrying it.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.240
Sure, kid.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.680
Stop complaining.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.920
And move faster.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.640
Where's the manhole?

24:34.720 --> 24:35.760
Over there.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.280
-You carried it this far?
-We did.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.520
You're crazy.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.320
Someone's there.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.400
It's just dark. No one is there.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.320
-A white guy.
-Let's run.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.480
Stop.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.640
He fell in because of you.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.160
-We must help him.
-All right.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.800
Hold the flashlight.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.000
He wouldn't have fallen in
if you left the cover here.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.520
We only borrowed it.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.840
Sure. Borrowed my ass.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.760
Shine the light.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.720
You see what you did?

25:17.800 --> 25:19.080
We're sorry.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.920
Careful.

25:24.880 --> 25:25.880
Hey, gadjo.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.080
You alive? What happened?

25:30.240 --> 25:32.040
Don't worry. We'll help you.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
Hello.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.600
Where am I?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.920
A hospital with doctors.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.440
You'll be fine.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.640
You've just slept a few days.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.720
What?

26:11.360 --> 26:14.560
A few days? How many?

26:15.160 --> 26:17.080
Well, I brought you in on Wednesday.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.680
And today is?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.640
I don't know.
I'm not really keeping track.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.240
And who are you?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.960
Me? I'm Gabo.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.480
I found you in a sewer.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.320
When we were putting back
a cover we sto-- I mean found.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.520
And what do you want?

26:33.600 --> 26:35.160
Nothing. I'm watching over you.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.000
You were asleep. They could rob you.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.960
There's all sorts of people.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.960
A Gypsy watches over me.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.480
I'll be damned.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.240
Wait.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.480
There's something wrong with my feet.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.640
What about mine?
People say they smell bad.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.800
Wait,

27:02.880 --> 27:05.080
I can't move my feet.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.720
Oh, that. The doctor said so.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.080
-Other than that, you're okay.
-I can't--

27:11.160 --> 27:14.000
-Morning, Mr. Hunder.
-Can't move my legs.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.400
-You look great!
-Can't move my legs.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.560
Can't move my legs!

27:18.640 --> 27:22.120
-Calm down.
-Fuck, I don't feel my legs!

27:22.200 --> 27:24.520
-Help!
-Calm down.

27:24.600 --> 27:29.560
I can't feel my legs! I can't…

27:29.640 --> 27:34.720
-Nurse Helga!
-I can't move!

27:34.800 --> 27:35.800
Move!

27:41.240 --> 27:42.240
Those bastards.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.240
That's the way, dear.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.000
And stop yelling.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.440
Mr. Hunder?

27:51.520 --> 27:52.760
Lacko, you alive?

27:56.360 --> 27:59.400
Mr. Varcovsky, you must breathe.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.280
Is that all?

28:04.560 --> 28:05.960
Based on the blood test,

28:06.040 --> 28:09.320
your BAC was around 0.2
at the time of the accident.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.560
How many times
do I have to tell you, moron?

28:11.640 --> 28:13.920
I was robbed and left for dead.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.080
And you drank before or after?

28:16.160 --> 28:17.240
After.

28:17.320 --> 28:20.440
There was a cold one ready in the sewer,
so I helped myself.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.160
Lean into it, Simonka.

28:25.640 --> 28:30.040
Up, down.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.400
Easy but thorough. Okay, my dear?

28:33.480 --> 28:34.920
Now I'll handle Hunder.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.880
-You're still here?
-We're done.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.600
-Good-bye.
-Bye.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.800
Mr. Hunder, it's time.

28:41.880 --> 28:46.400
Breathe in and out.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.680
-You feel no pain?
-None.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.880
At least we'll take off this.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.800
And we'll do the other side.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.160
IT'S FOOD AND PAJAMAS

29:19.360 --> 29:22.080
Zdeni, we need to talk.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.240
I might never walk again.

29:30.320 --> 29:34.800
Some things will be different,
but we'll manage.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.960
We'll fix it as a man and wife.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.840
SOME THINGS CAN'T BE FIXED

29:41.840 --> 29:42.920
Are you crazy?

29:43.800 --> 29:48.120
You think you'll find
someone better than me?

29:48.200 --> 29:50.600
You'll never get rid of me! Forget it!

29:51.680 --> 29:52.920
I'm your husband!

29:54.280 --> 29:57.200
What-- What's this? Leave me alone.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.560
I don't want this! No!

30:05.560 --> 30:09.200
See? Quiet as a little lamb.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.160
Pity I did not have those at home.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.920
Do you want a few?

30:18.960 --> 30:21.800
They kept Lacko there for a few weeks.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.520
Mr. Angalai, let me explain
as simply as possible

30:24.600 --> 30:26.040
so even you can understand.

30:26.120 --> 30:30.120
For us, the hospital means
as little as the cover.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.360
So please skip that.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.400
What happened after the hospital?

30:34.480 --> 30:36.880
Well, Zdenka brought him home.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.680
And he tried to be nice,
seeking forgiveness.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.320
Watch it!

30:52.680 --> 30:54.400
I meant, careful with the table.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.960
You'll leave me here like this?

31:27.920 --> 31:31.400
All alone, my feet on the table

31:31.480 --> 31:35.200
Life doesn't hurt any more

31:35.960 --> 31:38.920
All alone, my feet on the table

31:39.000 --> 31:43.240
Even the bad things seem good

31:43.880 --> 31:47.400
I kinda like it

31:47.480 --> 31:50.440
But she left anyway,
and Lacko was very sad.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.880
I see. So Lacko was very sad.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.440
-Yes. I still feel his sorrow.
-Me too.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.440
And then, Lacko finally went back to work.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.720
He looked forward to it,
but it was much harder

32:07.800 --> 32:09.320
because his legs didn't work.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.720
Stupid threshold.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.880
Even the threshold to the door
gave him problems.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.120
Not to mention the elevator.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.240
Invalids are like Gypsies.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.760
Nobody cares about them.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.200
You know how hard it is
for an invalid to close a door?

32:45.280 --> 32:48.600
So I told my boys to watch him,
for his own safety.

32:59.920 --> 33:03.760
Jesus. I can't stop.
Holy Jesus, Mother Mary!

33:04.840 --> 33:05.840
Ouch!

33:07.120 --> 33:08.240
Gadjo is hurt.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.800
-Hey, you okay?
-Don't touch me!

33:13.360 --> 33:14.360
And fuck off!

33:19.680 --> 33:22.520
Stupid fucking legs.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.480
Dear residents.

33:24.560 --> 33:30.040
If you want to meet the new mayor,
Eduard Kot,

33:30.120 --> 33:33.360
please come to the main square at noon.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.120
There will be presents.

33:36.200 --> 33:43.120
I repeat. If you want to meet
the new mayor, Eduard Kot…

33:43.200 --> 33:44.920
Hey! My buddy!

33:45.000 --> 33:46.880
That's the last person I need.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.880
-They let you out?
-What do you want?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.840
-Brave soldier reporting for duty.
-What for?

33:55.480 --> 33:56.760
I'm here to help.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.240
No help needed.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.760
-I heard you fell over.
-Heard where?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.680
Gypsies know everything.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.680
Now what?

34:04.760 --> 34:06.600
I'll help.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.639
-No, don't. Fuck! You want to kill me?
-Watch out!

34:10.719 --> 34:12.159
Stupid Gypsies!

34:12.239 --> 34:13.360
Who's a Gypsy?

34:13.880 --> 34:15.120
I am a Gypsy.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.679
Can't you see he's disabled?

34:21.400 --> 34:22.880
Shit. Are you trying to kill me?

34:23.719 --> 34:26.520
I saved your life.
I don't want to kill you.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.440
I know you saved me.

34:28.520 --> 34:32.000
And I fucking thank you
for this fucked-up life!

34:34.920 --> 34:36.760
Lacko, being this angry ain't right.

34:37.679 --> 34:39.639
When I'm angry, I prefer to sing.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.400
Chabaraba, chip chipó

34:43.480 --> 34:46.239
Yeah, right. That's gonna help me.
Chabaraba, chip chipó.

34:49.239 --> 34:50.320
It helps me.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.120
Damn, come here, you chabaraba, chipó.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.920
I knew you'd need me.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.880
-Friends must help each other.
-Okay. Just move.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.640
-Watch it. Christ.
-And up we go.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.560
Here comes Lightning Lacko.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.360
Vlado, help me.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.200
Can't you see I'm busy?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.400
I see.

35:45.360 --> 35:51.200
I'll let you touch it,
but please be gentle.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.200
You look great, Mr. Mayor.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.400
How much is it worth?

36:02.480 --> 36:06.640
For Slovaks, it's priceless.
It's a national treasure.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.760
It should represent the town,
not sit in a dusty display.

36:09.840 --> 36:13.200
-It's the crown jewel of this museum.
-I thought that was you.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.680
Mayor, you're so…

36:16.440 --> 36:17.520
Mr. Hunder.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.200
You're finally back.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.840
Everything has been falling apart
without you.

36:24.920 --> 36:30.360
Mr. Mayor here came to see how we're doing

36:30.440 --> 36:34.440
and how he could help.

36:34.520 --> 36:38.800
Well, I will try to support you.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.240
But quid pro quo.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.400
I must go.

36:44.480 --> 36:48.400
Please, there's one more thing…

37:15.160 --> 37:16.680
BROKEN TOILET
LIGHTS DON'T WORK

37:16.760 --> 37:17.880
OIL HINGES
CHECK DOORS

38:16.960 --> 38:19.800
Shit! I hate this life.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.080
Loading gears, sewing plate and engine.
All busted.

38:44.280 --> 38:48.200
Hello, Zdena. I would like to talk.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.600
Zdena, you there?

39:05.760 --> 39:11.280
Zdenka, darling, I would like to--

39:12.840 --> 39:13.840
Zdenka?

39:14.680 --> 39:15.680
Zdenka.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.440
Zdena!

39:40.680 --> 39:41.880
Fuck this.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.560
Working on the sewing machine again?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.480
No. I'm making an obstacle course.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.600
Will it work?

39:49.640 --> 39:52.120
I doubt it. I have no spare parts.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.320
Why are you still here?

39:53.840 --> 39:55.400
I fell asleep again.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.600
I'll do one more round and head home. Bye.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.440
Fuck! This isn't happening.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.760
You don't have the right.

40:23.280 --> 40:27.120
What do you even care about
the Slovak national treasures?

40:27.640 --> 40:29.160
You're not even Slovak.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.440
I'm Russian but also Slovak.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.040
This hat is a national treasure.

40:34.120 --> 40:37.640
Don't yell at me.
Who's the director? You or me?

40:37.720 --> 40:39.240
I don't have time for this.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.600
Please excuse, Mr. Bilko.
He's just acting up.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.440
And send my regards to the Mayor.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.320
Hey, you. Stop.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.880
-Hey, asshole. You hear me?
-Mr. Hunder.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.680
Stop right there!

40:58.600 --> 41:00.480
Fucking wheelchair!

41:00.560 --> 41:04.200
You gave Štefánik's hat to that prick?

41:04.880 --> 41:07.400
Excuse me?
He's the assistant of our mayor.

41:07.480 --> 41:09.600
That cunt turned me into a cripple!

41:10.400 --> 41:13.640
Your accident was your own fault.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.200
Are you mental?

41:15.800 --> 41:19.640
Mr. Hunder, you're an alcoholic.
The police confirmed it.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.840
That's how you ended up in that sewer.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.480
And you should be grateful
I let you work here.

41:25.560 --> 41:30.600
Because a janitor who's unable to
change a lightbulb

41:30.680 --> 41:32.720
would hardly find work elsewhere.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.360
Bitch.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.760
Shit! Fuck!

42:03.840 --> 42:05.880
Holy Mary, Lacko.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.120
-What did you do?
-What do you think?

42:10.200 --> 42:12.520
I fell. Splattered like horse shit.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.520
-Your arm's okay?
-Wait. Get the chair.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.560
Break your arms, and you're just a torso.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.920
Wait. Don't smack me with it.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.240
-Shit!
-No more racing for you.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.320
-Arms okay?
-The hell if I know.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.320
Dear God, what did you eat for lunch?

42:30.680 --> 42:31.680
Fuck.

42:34.560 --> 42:35.920
You in the seat?

42:36.000 --> 42:39.160
How should I know? Can't feel anything
from my ass cheeks down.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.880
-And now?
-All right. Shit.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.800
You don't have to rip my balls off.
We're off to the police station.

42:46.560 --> 42:47.960
-Where?
-To the police.

42:48.640 --> 42:52.280
Oh, man. I forgot I have some work
'cause my cousin needs--

42:52.360 --> 42:55.960
I said we're going to the police.
Right now.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.600
All right.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.560
Why didn't you wait inside?

43:00.360 --> 43:02.080
What were you doing there this late?

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
Jerking off.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.640
God, you ask such stupid questions.

43:07.720 --> 43:10.160
-You've been there a long time.
-Well, I've got problems.

43:10.680 --> 43:14.000
-My legs don't work, remember?
-I see.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.960
Lacko, I can't go any closer.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.360
I'll give you a push, okay?

43:26.880 --> 43:29.680
There's even a ramp.
You can do it. That's great.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.400
Really awesome.

43:31.480 --> 43:32.840
I'll wait for you here.

43:32.920 --> 43:36.200
Though I can't understand why
someone would go to the cops willingly.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.080
Evening. I want to report something.

43:50.760 --> 43:51.760
What?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.880
A simple thing. I was assaulted.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.640
Go up to the second floor.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.080
And how would I do that?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.440
There's an elevator.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.240
You're really Mr. Nice.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.080
Hello?

44:36.880 --> 44:38.120
Can someone help me?

45:24.120 --> 45:25.120
Goddamn it.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.240
Fucking elevator.

45:38.520 --> 45:39.640
Fuck!

45:40.760 --> 45:42.320
What's all this ruckus?

45:44.560 --> 45:46.760
Citizen, why are you laying here?

45:47.360 --> 45:48.440
Get up at once.

45:50.160 --> 45:54.000
How am I supposed to stand
if I can't even sit up?

45:54.960 --> 45:56.200
You're drunk.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.000
I'm disabled.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.760
And your shitty elevator
stole my wheelchair.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.520
So the lift stole your wheelchair.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.120
How about we wait for it?

46:09.880 --> 46:13.560
Well, I guess it ate it, right?

46:14.840 --> 46:15.840
You know what?

46:16.600 --> 46:22.280
Screw you, you green dickhead!

46:29.520 --> 46:31.360
-Mr. Hundert, first of all…
-Hunder.

46:32.960 --> 46:36.200
…we'd like to apologize
for our member on duty.

46:37.760 --> 46:41.480
And if I beat the shit out of your member,
would that be okay?

46:42.560 --> 46:45.760
Mr. Hundert, my colleague was doing
his job, and--

46:45.840 --> 46:48.880
If you guys did your job,
I would still be walking.

46:50.680 --> 46:53.320
Mr. Hundert, I am aware
you had an accident,

46:53.400 --> 46:56.080
and there are some issues
you'll have to live with

46:56.160 --> 46:58.000
for the rest of your life.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.800
What accident?

47:00.440 --> 47:01.960
I was tricked by an ad.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.200
They assaulted me and robbed me.

47:04.280 --> 47:07.720
The guy who did it has Štefánik's hat.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.520
He works for the mayor.

47:10.680 --> 47:13.320
-I see, Mr. Hundert.
-Hunder.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.400
Drinking is not shameful.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.720
Everybody does it occasionally.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.280
Even I do. Off duty, of course.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.440
It's only shameful if you don't admit it.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.320
Are you out of your mind?

47:27.480 --> 47:29.360
Call the video rental guy.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.760
They call him Mr. Prague, or something.

47:31.840 --> 47:34.400
And unleash your member on him.

47:34.480 --> 47:37.240
And you'll see
how quickly he spills the beans.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.040
Mr. Hundert, for us, the case is closed.

47:42.120 --> 47:45.840
You don't need us. You need medical help.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.800
Tell you what, Mr. Hundert.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.520
Rehab is relaxing. Like a spa.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.120
I've been there myself. Twice.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.480
And you're disabled?

47:58.600 --> 48:00.360
Then the state can reimburse you.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.080
I mean, maybe.

48:08.680 --> 48:11.080
The world's gone mad.
They beat whites now?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.640
Even the disabled.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.320
Unbelievable.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.000
And where are we going, Lacko?

48:22.400 --> 48:23.560
Home.

48:23.640 --> 48:26.960
Oh, my. That sounds amazing.

48:28.640 --> 48:32.960
Nice place. Lovely.
Much like our community.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.640
What do you really want from me?

48:34.720 --> 48:35.920
Me? Nothing.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.280
You just need help,
and helping others is a good thing.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.360
You're an imbecile.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.840
So are you, Lacko. We're the same.
We just have different shades.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.320
Wait up, Bardos. Invalid coming through.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.720
Mr. Hunder, what about my window?

48:55.320 --> 48:56.400
We'll sort it out.

48:57.080 --> 49:00.520
-I have a cousin who--
-Who're you?

49:01.160 --> 49:03.960
I am Gabo Angalai. Like an angel.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.520
Give him a break. He's here with me.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.840
Piss off. We can't all fit.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.400
If you're an angel, I'm a racer.

49:18.280 --> 49:20.160
Right. Lightning Lacko.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.280
How much do you pay for electricity?

49:39.720 --> 49:41.960
'Cause you can avoid that.
I have a cousin--

49:42.040 --> 49:45.040
Don't drag anyone over here.
I'm fine with paying.

49:48.720 --> 49:53.840
But it's a nice place. With an elevator.
You don't have to take the stairs.

49:53.920 --> 49:57.400
Would be better if the damned kids didn't
mess it up every day.

49:58.120 --> 50:01.920
Maybe if you had a pulley
out of your window,

50:02.440 --> 50:03.960
you could pull yourself up.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.040
-Got any sugar?
-Up there.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.120
Hand me that envelope.

50:16.840 --> 50:17.840
Lacko.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.800
-What is it?
-A letter from Zdena.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.840
Studenková?

50:30.600 --> 50:31.760
My wife.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.440
You live with Zdena Studenková?

50:33.960 --> 50:36.640
Yes. Me and three others.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.160
She wants a divorce.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Lacko, wanna watch TV?

51:07.040 --> 51:08.040
My brother.

51:08.760 --> 51:09.760
Brother.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.360
Winnetou is great.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.600
You know his horse's name is Ilchi?

51:16.760 --> 51:17.920
It means wind.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.760
Maybe you should name your wheelchair.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.120
Tornado?

51:25.960 --> 51:27.280
The natives are like us.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.160
They even give us similar names.

51:32.360 --> 51:35.800
Indi-ans. Cig-ans.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.680
And they also have
a hard time finding jobs.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.280
What are you doing?

51:43.160 --> 51:44.920
Thinking about your pulley idea.

51:46.320 --> 51:47.680
Don't eat that.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.040
If you pick it up in three seconds,
it's okay.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.200
You know what's great about these movies?

51:53.280 --> 51:56.720
The evil always lose,
and the good prevail.

51:56.800 --> 52:00.200
Yeah. But in life,
the biggest bastards win.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.480
Got it?

52:02.560 --> 52:03.960
A regular guy is just trash.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.720
No matter what you do.

52:06.240 --> 52:09.800
You can work your ass off
or bend over backwards, and nothing.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.680
Your ass stays poor.

52:11.760 --> 52:14.640
And you're supposed to
thank those up there for that.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.000
Thanks for my poor ass.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.720
Then you turn on the TV,
and you see morons.

52:19.800 --> 52:22.560
Those ministers, MPs, dickheads…

52:22.640 --> 52:26.200
And you're supposed to respect them?
For what? They live off of our money.

52:26.280 --> 52:30.520
Mine, yours, everyone's.
Holy shit, it pisses me off so much!

52:30.600 --> 52:34.360
And if you make them do honest work
for two hours, they fuck it up!

52:34.440 --> 52:35.560
Fucking morons.

52:36.440 --> 52:37.680
How did it come to this?

52:37.760 --> 52:42.400
Even the mayor is a sodding mobster! Fuck!

52:42.480 --> 52:44.840
'Cause we don't have Old Shatterhand.

52:45.880 --> 52:47.360
He'd sort things out.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.520
At full moon, we leave.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.840
And we won't rest
until we find the murderer.

52:56.440 --> 52:57.680
Maybe all we really need is…

52:59.000 --> 53:00.040
Lightning Lacko.

53:07.920 --> 53:10.000
Psych tests for gun license owners
DO NOT KNOCK

53:11.440 --> 53:13.360
Mr. Hunder, no need to worry.

53:13.440 --> 53:17.960
These tests are a standard procedure
for future gun license owners.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.320
It's just a formality to prevent
unstable and aggressive people

53:21.400 --> 53:22.680
from getting a weapon.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.240
The written exam takes 60 minutes.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.760
We'll be done in two hours.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.120
You can start right away.

53:46.920 --> 53:48.080
Damn it.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.400
Damn it.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
No idea.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.320
B.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.520
Come on.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.800
Mr. Hunder, the results indicate that

54:23.880 --> 54:26.320
you possesses
traits of emotional instability

54:26.400 --> 54:30.640
and dissociative traits characteristic
for borderline personality disorder.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.320
Right. That's me.

54:34.960 --> 54:37.120
Do you have anger issues?

54:46.240 --> 54:47.400
What the hell do you care?

54:47.480 --> 54:50.880
Just give me that damn paper,
and stop pissing me off!

54:52.680 --> 54:56.760
Bastards! I've been there for two hours
and now you throw me out?

54:57.640 --> 54:59.720
Shove that paper up your ass!

55:05.480 --> 55:06.720
What are you doing?

55:08.120 --> 55:11.120
NATIONAL TREASURE STOLEN

55:12.640 --> 55:14.960
The thief deserves a bullet.

55:19.360 --> 55:23.760
One rifle, some powder,
and problem solved.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.320
NITER 75% - CHARCOAL 15%
SULFUR 10%

56:20.280 --> 56:23.440
New mayor is pacing ahead swiftly

56:23.520 --> 56:27.480
and approved
a hefty donation of 1,5 million crowns

56:27.560 --> 56:29.240
for the city museum.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.560
Culture deserves our attention.

56:31.640 --> 56:36.600
My predecessors only invested in things
that created a personal profit for them.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.240
I am not like them.

56:38.320 --> 56:42.760
Mayor declined to comment on
allegations that he used his power

56:42.840 --> 56:45.120
to appoint his friends
into the city council

56:45.200 --> 56:48.600
and cancel
long-term winter maintenance contract

56:48.680 --> 56:51.600
only to grant it to his friend's company.

56:52.600 --> 56:55.240
Sorry, but I refuse to
answer this question.

56:55.320 --> 56:57.520
This wasn't the deal! Turn it off!

56:57.600 --> 57:00.080
Once a thief, always a thief.

57:00.160 --> 57:01.680
Reporting from…

57:09.840 --> 57:13.360
Mrs. Hunder, evening. Please wait.
Thank you.

57:14.480 --> 57:20.440
-What brings you here?
-I am going to get divorce papers.

57:21.640 --> 57:22.960
I hope he signed them.

57:23.480 --> 57:27.600
That's long overdue.
He wasn't the man for you.

57:27.680 --> 57:30.120
If you saw the company
he brought home last night…

57:31.280 --> 57:32.920
Well, that's none of my business.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.880
I hope he won't
cause you any more trouble.

57:36.360 --> 57:37.360
Hopefully.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.560
Whoa.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.120
DIVORCE PAPERS

58:09.200 --> 58:10.200
Zdeni.

58:10.800 --> 58:11.800
Zdenka!

58:17.680 --> 58:18.680
Lacko!

58:20.480 --> 58:22.520
-Come on.
-Coming.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.960
Good evening.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.360
Evening.

58:35.440 --> 58:36.520
Got it, Lacko!

58:38.240 --> 58:40.080
We're testing a pulley.

58:52.200 --> 58:53.520
Park me here.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.600
And the bottles we brought,
put them over there. This one as well.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.040
-There?
-Yes. Up front.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.000
Wait up.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.720
-That's a beauty.
-Isn't it?

59:18.360 --> 59:21.240
Like Captain Flint's rifle.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.320
Hold this.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.200
Okay, good. Now plug your ears.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.440
Holy crap.

59:37.520 --> 59:41.440
That? Wait till you see
what this baby can do.

59:42.720 --> 59:43.720
Is it stronger?

59:44.760 --> 59:46.360
You bet it's stronger.

59:47.040 --> 59:48.040
Watch this.

59:51.200 --> 59:52.280
Beautiful.

59:52.360 --> 59:54.080
Saving the best for last.

59:54.160 --> 59:56.080
-Number three?
-Number three.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.400
You're about to see something.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.120
Ready.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.640
Hold it. Right.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.240
Holy shit! Let's run!

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.520
Hey, wait! Come get me!

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.400
Lacko, you're going mad.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.440
Okay, so I overdid it a bit.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:27.960
You're insane.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.960
Insane, my ass. Shit happens, you know.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.080
Gabo…

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.280
why didn't you report it?

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.200
Report what?

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.640
Mr. Angalai, didn't you find it suspicious
that some guy was testing a museum rifle

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.840
on the outskirts of town?

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.560
It wasn't some guy. It was Lacko.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.680
And he works at the museum.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760
But at night?

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.320
It's not his fault
that he is so hardworking.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.640
Mr. Inspector, may I eat that?

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.400
No.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.120
I can't believe he's that stupid.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.920
He's not stupid, just different. Like you.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.320
On the other hand,
what he says makes sense.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.280
You're starting to catch on.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.920
Hunder got beat up, ended as a cripple
and wanted revenge.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.360
He just needed a gun. He had loads of them
at the museum. He had many choices.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.240
And he was a custodian.
A skillful one at that.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.080
So fixing them up was child's play.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.640
But I still think
this theory is hanging on a hair.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.680
I don't think that you have to
worry about that anymore.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.720
The police didn't listen.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.200
And when a guy like him feels injustice,
he does justice.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.600
Lacko wanted revenge.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.360
So he paid a visit to Mr. Prague.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.840
It's done.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.240
You'll shit bricks when you see
what people do for money.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.040
Right. See ya.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.000
What? We don't do cripples.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.880
You don't remember me?

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.040
Yeah, right. The East German porn freak?

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.240
We're closed. Roll in tomorrow.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.360
Take a better look.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.880
Oh, shit.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.920
The stereo guy.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.640
-Stay cool, will ya?
-You made me a cripple.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.560
Look on the bright side.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.400
You roll wherever you go.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.200
Now you'll give me the names
of all the bastards who were there.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.280
How about a new blockbuster instead?

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.400
It's called Speed. Got it right here.
Almost like your biopic.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.440
You'll shit yourself when you see it.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.840
Mr. Prague didn't
give his associates away?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.000
No.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.320
-But he found out anyway.
-He did.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.600
And how?

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.600
Shame you weren't paying attention.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.120
Fortunately, I wrote it all down.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.280
At least wipe that smirk off your face.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.880
The car stopped
near a derelict block of flats.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.480
Detective got out.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.880
Before his colleague
clumsily lumbered out of the vehicle,

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.760
he surveyed the area.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.960
Another night. Another murder.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.800
-Stick to the facts.
-Right.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.760
Okay. Height, 175 cm.
Weight around 75 kilograms.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.440
Black hair, bondage clothing,
with an empty fanny pack.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.720
And yes, a bullet in the head,
to which you said that…

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.480
he looks like a golem.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.760
He looks like a golem.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.640
Golem. That's good.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.360
Keep it professional.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.760
I'm just getting inspiration.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.760
You're supposed to be here
for investigation, not inspiration.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.480
One day you'll thank me
for writing it all down.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.600
-What does that imbecile want here?
-Crap.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.720
Exactly.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.240
Gentlemen…

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840
what happened here?

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.240
A murder.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.040
Maybe this bullshit was tolerated
till now,

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.920
but things are changing.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.840
See? He's nice.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.120
And you thought he's an imbecile.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.320
Names. Your names.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.080
-I'm Dempsey and this is Makepeace.
-Makepeace. Enchanté.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.800
Dempsey and Makepeace,
you're in deep shit.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
Can I help you?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.280
I thought I knew him.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.640
And did you?

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.720
No.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.880
I want a report by tomorrow.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.000
You're through fucking around.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.000
-You have his cell?
-It's gone.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.680
You gotta be fucking joking.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.720
-This is a major fuck up.
-Calm down.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.920
All because of your stupid ads!

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.360
-I gave you a clear order!
-You're not in charge anymore.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.480
OLD VINARSKA STREET
MIDNIGHT TOMORROW

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.880
What you doin'?

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960
Training for the Paralympics.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.600
Oh. Bravo.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840
What is this?

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.760
For your machine. Won't work without it.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840
The sewing machine?

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.520
My wife died, no kids. I don't need it.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.720
Okay, thank you.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.840
You're welcome.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.720
Vlado…

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.360
I'm going home, and I'd like to take it.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.160
Could you help me down the stairs?

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.680
No problem.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.279
Hello, Zdeni.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.240
SIGN IT!

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200
Zdeni.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.760
You were right.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.800
Anything can be fixed if there's a will.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.439
I realize that now.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.240
And I'm trying to be a better man.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.279
Trying to be better at things
I might not be good at.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.720
You know, for example,

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.960
to express my love.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.359
Even though it's hard to see.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:35.520
Maybe the love you can't see
is the most beautiful.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:40.720
But even the blind can love, right?

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.560
Just like I am trying to move a bit more,
but I can't.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640
YOU STINK

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.000
Right. Classic me.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.560
Got a new hobby, and I'm sweating a bit.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.760
It's hard for me to take a shower.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.840
But that's okay.
Anything can be done somehow.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.160
I sweat more by moving less.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Done.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.800
And say hello to Marek.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.920
Okay, I will tell you one more time
and slowly so you can grasp it.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.960
You know what you can do
with this pocket money?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.440
You'll screw this up for me.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.720
You think you're better than us?

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.840
Pick it up.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.600
-Sorry, boss.
-Let's go.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.320
What's a cripple doing here at midnight?

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.080
I think he's out for a jog.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.960
-Go.
-I won't run over a cripple, you maniac.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.080
You'll free him from misery.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.360
And what is he doing?

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.840
He's backpedaling.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.520
-He's nuts.
-Come on. Go.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.760
What is that?

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240
A trumpet.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.280
Need backup at Vinarska Street.
We're in pursuit…

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.800
of a man in a wheelchair.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.920
Report it.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
You report it.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.560
Car six here.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.880
The cripple got away.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.080
You can't be serious.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.000
Did you at least arrest Viktor?

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.640
Hunder played the sheriff,
put himself above the law.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.320
Shit, it's like a western shoot-out.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.840
And during one night at the museum,

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.320
he did more for the city than you
in your entire career.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.960
He should be in jail.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.320
So prove him guilty.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.640
There's your witness.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.360
So you don't care
that your best buddy is a murderer?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.400
Lacko is not a murderer. He's a good guy.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.480
So great that if he sent me to hell,
I'd enjoy the ride.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.120
He made you an accomplice.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.720
Their blood is on your hands too, Gabo.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.960
Why do you call me Gabo?

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.680
Because that's your name, isn't it?

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.440
But to you, I'm Mr. Angalai.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.840
He's yours. I don't have the nerve.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.000
Seven dead men, Gabo.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.040
That was self-defense.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.960
Self-defense my ass!

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.120
So, why didn't you arrest him
a long time ago?

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.880
'Cause he ran away.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960
Ran away?

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.200
But his legs don't work.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080
Just a minute.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.120
Mr. Hunder,
it's Detective Kaiser and Detective Fin.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.800
Open the door. We need to talk.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.440
Hunder, let us in.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.120
I'm on the can.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.040
What did he say? He's shitting?

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.840
Yeah, right.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.560
He got away.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.720
How? He flew out of the window
on a wheelchair?

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.960
Pretty much, yeah.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.880
Are you insane?

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.400
Don't even think about publishing this.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.480
It's going into the report either way.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.440
I retire in two years. You, in 30.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.800
So think twice.
Do you really want people to laugh at you

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.720
for letting a handicapped man get away?

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:49.040
Lacko Hunder knew damn well
why we came after him.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.560
Why are you telling him this?

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.320
You might as well put it into your book.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.080
It's a shame there are
no books about us Gypsies.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.200
But that's not a bad idea.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.240
My friend here could write one for you.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.280
Really? And can Lacko be in it as well?

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.600
Of course. Sure.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:18.560
Lacko can be in it.
But you have to tell me more about him.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.520
I will tell you all about him.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.360
-Really?
-Gypsies too. It's all related.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.160
First, I took Lacko home to our community.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.880
No one will find you here.
Not even the police.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800
Hi, Leo.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.240
So, ain't it nice here?

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.120
Couldn't be better.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.320
See? And you were scared.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.640
Gabo, who's this gadjo?

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.560
It's Lacko. He's my buddy.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.400
Never saw a Gypsy with a gadjo friend,

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.520
but you've always been different.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.320
This is where I live
with my sister and her three kids.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.520
Welcome to our home.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.120
This is my library.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.160
I've even got Winnetou.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.200
But now I'm reading Švejk.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.520
-You know Sandokan and Feri.
-Hi.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.160
They helped you out of the sewer.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.360
And this is Tiffany.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.680
She took after her mother.
The best in her class.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760
Who's this?

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600
Laci.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.600
The sewer guy.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.080
He just came to visit.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.560
Why did you drag him here?

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.040
He's just visiting.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.360
What are you hiding from?

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.240
She knows when people lie to her.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.440
We had a small misunderstanding
with the police.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.840
We don't need any more problems.
We've got enough of our own.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.560
Anicka, just for a day.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.000
I stayed at his place too.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.800
Very well. But tomorrow he'll be gone.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.120
Tidy it up. It's lunch time.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.720
Great. I'll show you everything.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.960
I'm not hungry.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:09.840
You have to try this.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.080
There's no cooking like home cooking.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.640
I want some too.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.160
You'll get a carrot.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560
Thanks.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.760
-Why did he get some?
-Eat quietly.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:29.920
Because he's our guest!

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.200
-Why did he get?
-Quiet!

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.000
Shanks are good for joints,
and I can't walk.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.440
Lacko, you shouldn't live alone.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.920
I deserve nothing else.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.240
I chased away my son.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.320
My wife won't even speak to me.
Went to live with her sister.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.880
-Why did you chase him away?
-'Cause I'm an idiot.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.280
I see.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.040
We had a fight. He threw it in my face
that I'm just a janitor.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.200
I got so angry,
I threw his stereo out the window.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.840
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.560
I mean being a janitor.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.800
A few years ago,
it was an honor to work with your hands.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.800
Now everyone treats me like
a piece of shit.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.560
Now everyone avoids me like the plague.
You know how that feels?

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.200
You're telling me that?

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.520
Everything would be okay
if I didn't have such a short fuse.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.480
I even tell myself: Lacko, don't be mad.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.640
But then it gets to me,
and I get so angry!

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.880
See? Even now. Just talking about it
and I'm mad already.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.240
-I'm mentally unstable.
-One more reason to try singing.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.160
It helps me a lot.
My favorite tune goes like this…

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.840
You're nuts.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.120
If I had your legs, I'd catch it.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.200
Come on. Add some voltage.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.400
Same crazy moves as my son Marek.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.400
Gabo thinks it's his fault.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480
What?

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.640
That you fell.
That you are handicapped now.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.680
That definitely wasn't his fault.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.760
It was a different story.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.400
Gabo is a good man.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.160
Lacko, don't get him in trouble.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.880
Tomorrow, I'll go to the police.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.600
Or maybe I won't.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360
Hide me.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.400
How's it going? Good?

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.280
Why are you here?

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.360
We already paid.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.560
Just came for a friendly visit.
You should be happy.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.320
You can help me for a change.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.960
I'm looking for someone.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.320
-A gadjo in a wheelchair.
-No one is here.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.400
If he ain't here, he ain't.

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.240
Dzeko, get lost!

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.680
Don't tell me what to do, bitch.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.680
Get off her!

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.320
Go away!

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.160
Hey, asshole!
What do you want here, you Apache?

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.680
Oh.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.520
Hello.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.760
And you said he's not here.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.120
I'm fed up with assholes like you.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.040
You're only brave when you're armed.
Alone, you'd shit your pants.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.360
Bullshit.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.960
Tell him to piss off.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.880
Dzeko, it might be a good idea
if you left.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.800
Cut it short. Just tell him to scram.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.440
I did. Just a bit more diplomatic,
you know?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.080
Listen up.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.160
You're coming with me now,
or I'll slash your tires.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.160
You know what they say,

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.200
don't bring a knife to a gun fight.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.720
Doesn't hurt.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.680
Fuck this.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.000
Are you insane? What have you done?

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.520
-He was just defending you.
-Shut up! You brought him here!

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.400
I'll tell the police everything.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.640
They'll never come, but Viktor will.
And he's worse than a hundred devils!

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.120
Viktor's goons stole my family,
made me a cripple.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.240
And now you got them back?
Or started walking?

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.960
No. But I will make sure
it never happens to anyone else.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.560
I'll end it all.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.720
But first, I have to find
something they stole and put it back.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.920
Your boys could help me.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.680
So, where did you go after that?

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.640
-To get that manhole cover.
-Geez, the cover again.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.440
Lacko had plans with it.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.680
And then?

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.920
To city hall. The mayor's office.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.440
Boys, you think you could get
a funny hat from upstairs?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.080
No problem.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.440
Watch out. I'm coming.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.880
Careful. Watch your step. Don't fall down.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.200
This could be it.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.440
The gadjo from TV.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.040
Hold the light. I'll show him.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.960
Yeah. Satanis. Let's go.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.840
Lacko knew that
he could set a trap with the hat.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.400
For Viktor, the mayor and all his pals.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.600
Just like Old Shatterhand.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.160
Now stomp.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.560
-Eh?
-Stomp your foot.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.000
A bit to the right. And a hard stomp.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.800
-What do you say?
-Wow.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.400
-Great trick.
-Years of practice.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.040
Help me out here.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.960
What are you looking at?
Never been to a museum?

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040
No.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.720
Come here.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.480
You've got nice stuff here.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.200
Right? Come.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.800
Open it.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.200
Hand me the stuff.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.640
I can't. We're in a museum.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.640
Today you can. Go.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.840
Today I can.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360
Nice.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.920
I could really use
something with a bigger punch.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.560
This.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.280
It's very much like you.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.720
Sturdy on wheels and balls of steel.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.680
Great.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.160
You go take a look around.
I will get ready.

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:26.840
-Take this as well.
-Right.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.000
That's stylish.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.240
Well, today I can.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.240
Great fabric.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.120
Gabo?

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.440
What are you doing here?

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520
I work here.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.280
Bullshit. It's past midnight.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.760
I fell asleep again.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.200
Lacko.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280
Evening.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.280
-Can I borrow this?
-What the hell are you wearing?

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.880
A uniform.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.080
Premium brand. For the battle.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640
What battle?

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.720
The battle for the museum.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.720
So Hunder knew there will be a fight?

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.840
He knew they'd come for the hat.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.000
-And Vladimir Bilko?
-Who's that?

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.760
The late museum doorman.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.720
Right. He spoke neither Slovak
nor Romani, but he wanted to help.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.320
Said his grandfather helped
against the Germans.

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.600
Probably a football player.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.840
Gabo, how did that battle
for the museum unfold?

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.440
Like Lacko said.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.440
First, we had to get ready.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.160
What's that?

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.760
Family heirloom.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:33.200
I wanted to give it to the museum,
but we can use it better.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.360
Who the fuck lost his mind at 2 a.m.?

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.840
Heard you're not dead yet.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.720
What?

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.240
Fuck you, asshole.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.760
The cripple awaits you at the museum.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.880
You bald testicle.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.800
You should have finished me off.
Now you're finished.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.040
-Fuck!
-Stop yelling!

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.600
Shut up, faggot.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.120
Kikinko is completely stressed. Look.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:22.280
Oh, no. Sorry, Kiki, my darling dearest.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.440
Get up. We have a job to do.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.960
Gabo, now you'll head home.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.800
I'm not leaving you, Lacko.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.000
Gabo, this is between me and them.
They stole my family.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.760
I'm your family. Almost.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.800
Gabo, if you want me to forgive you
crippling me, go home right now.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.840
So we're no longer friends?

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.760
Keep him safe.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.960
Of course, we are.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.520
-Good man.
-You should also piss off.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.920
You want to drive a Russian
from the battle?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.640
They're pissed off, Vlado.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.720
And armed.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.480
Good.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.200
What's this? Are you crazy?

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.360
A cripple-killer army?

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.080
He killed Mr. Prague, then Kiksi,

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.400
-and he also got me.
-Fuck Kiksi, and fuck Mr. Prague.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.560
-You're playing soldiers here?
-We're not playing.

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.320
That fucking torso killed my men.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.840
Right. That bastard fucked them up.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:21.840
Hold on. What did you say? Your men?

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.040
Those were my men, Viktor.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.760
Do you hear the difference?

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.680
Your men.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560
I pay you.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.920
I guess we disagree.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.640
Put that walrus into the trunk.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.600
Right. Let's see.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.720
The men stormed in
with the intent to kill…

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.320
but the hunters became the hunted.

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.440
Too feeble.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:17.480
Stopped by the click of a lighter.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.480
Welcome, boys.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.880
What the fuck was that?

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.480
Should've been just a cripple.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.800
Go around the back.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.280
-Then there was that crater.
-Right.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.160
That was caused by the grenade launcher.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.800
You think I can quote the poem Kill Them?

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.200
"Check thou thy steps,

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.520
for the places are sacred,
wherever thou turnest."

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.240
-That's from The Daughter of Sláva.
-Damn. You're right.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.120
Anyway, Hunder gave them hell.

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.040
Some men tried the back door

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.680
and were welcomed by
the Russian delegation,

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.920
Vladimir Bilko with a Degtyaryov DP.

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.840
In the main hall, the battle raged on.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.920
And another thug became a history piece,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.240
ended up in the display.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.680
You fucker. I'll get your scalp.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.480
-Karol is gone.
-They're all gone.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.800
Lojzo?

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.200
Not Lojzo!

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.680
You were into Lojzo?

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.000
I'll kill him!

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:10.200
It was a two-on-two,
but they shot ten men worth of ammo.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.280
I originally said 20,
but ten seems a bit more reasonable.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.360
What are you doing?

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.960
Vladimir Bilko ran out of
patience and ammo,

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:36.280
but he fought on
with the hammer and sickle.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.240
You're hit.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.040
It's but a scratch. Let's go.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.840
They tried to reach the upper floor,
inches away from escaping.

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:12.720
But you can't outrun a bullet.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.640
Vlado!

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.520
Vlado!

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.160
Fucking shit.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.800
Come out…

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.440
you chucklefuck.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.360
Shit.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.600
Missed me?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.640
Where did he come from?

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.200
Well, I can explain that.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280
Open up!

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.760
I just felt bad for him in that trunk.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
Anybody there?

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.880
Hello.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.960
What in God's name happened here?

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.720
Who are these people?

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.280
We must call the cops and an ambulance.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760
Good idea.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.360
I heard gunshots, so…

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.200
So you wanted to screw me over.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.880
Screw me over.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.560
I told you a hundred times
to forget about those stupid ads.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.480
We could have gone to a higher level
and make a fortune, but no.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.560
Not you.

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:36.080
Like a rabid dog,
you bit the hand that fed you.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.920
You can't fuck with me.

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.600
The cops were supposed to
get you at the Old Vineyards.

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.520
But then your cripple friend
from the ad showed up.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:53.360
Now the secret service is involved.
But I won't let them get to me.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.920
I won't let anyone screw my chance!

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.280
No one! Not you or anyone else!

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.960
The mayor delivered
a coup de grâce to Viktor.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.640
He knows he has little time left.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:12.280
He should leave and erase
any traces leading to him,

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.120
the head of the local Mafia.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.240
But he needed a smoke to calm down.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.440
Little did he know,
his opponent is still alive.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.560
The bullets were no match
for the manhole cover on his back.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.840
He emerged from the dark
in a kamikaze attack.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.000
They both fell into the devastated museum.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.080
Thus ends the story
of a man in a wheelchair

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:47.360
who would most probably die
were it not for, I can't believe this,

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.400
the stupid manhole cover
he used to armor his chair.

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.720
What will happen to Lacko?

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.200
I think it was just self-defense.

01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.000
And the mayor, the punko?

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.680
Punko Kot. That's good. I'll use that.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.800
Mister Commissioner
actually wrote his book.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.840
The names are different,
but that's how they usually do it.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.600
Maybe they'll make a movie about it.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.520
In the book, Lacko and Mr. Mayor die.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.480
But in real life, it wasn't that bad.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.080
The mayor went to have a sit-down.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.480
But not in a wheelchair, but in prison.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.240
And Lacko was never charged…

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320
DISABLED MURDERER IN COURT

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.240
…because it was self-defense.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.320
LADISLAV H. IS NOT GUILTY

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.920
And in the end, I even taught him
to manage his anger.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.480
They won't come.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.720
I knew exactly how this would end.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.560
I'm good at complaining and swearing,
but when it comes to my own faults…

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.080
Screw this.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.920
I don't deserve them.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.320
I'm a prick.

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.120
You're not.

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.440
They know you love them.

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.600
How could they when I never told them?

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.360
Even Grandpa deserves one.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.200
You can tell them now.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.320
Wow. Zdenka.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.720
Please sit.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.920
Gabo.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.240
This is my friend, Gabo.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.720
My pleasure.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.800
This is Marek.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.960
I'm having a soda.
Don't even like beer anymore.

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.840
Can I get you something?

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.120
The menu, please.

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.480
And can you please
turn down the music a bit?

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.680
Can't do that. The boss wants it that way.

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.960
Okay. Then can you please call him?

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.240
He's not here.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.320
Okay but, since he's not here,
can't you just turn it down?

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.680
We just want to talk to each other.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.160
Then go talk outside.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.200
What? I'm your customer.
I came here to talk.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.560
I'd do it or he'll throw
your stereo out of the window.

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.560
Shut up, punk.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.680
Leave my family out of this.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.320
-I asked politely.
-Shut your face.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:02.440
I'll shut yours, you redneck asshole!

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.800
-You want a piece of me?
-Bring it!

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.960
-Get the hell out!
-No way!

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.480
Stop! Now!

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.680
We're the customers,
so you turn it the fuck down.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:20.240
Okay. You want a lower volume,
you'll get a lower volume.

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.160
Zdenka,

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.160
you really caught me by surprise.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Thank you.

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:30.600
Turn it up.
I can't hear a thing over there.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.400
Customers complained.

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.640
Hey, this is a repast.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.240
Who are you calling a retard, you cow?

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.840
Cow? I'm an engineer.
I have a diploma. Tell them, Ivan.

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.280
Paulinka, leave this to me.

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.280
Ivan, sit down and shut up.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.120
-Who started this?
-That cripple.

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.760
Have you heard him?

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.560
Get up, prick.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.880
-Shut up.
-I said get up.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.920
-I'll show you a repast!
-Hey, leave him alone.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.520
This isn't normal.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.520
I thought we'd be able to talk here.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.000
You will never eat here again.

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.560
What did you say? I'll smack you.

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.080
Lacko, what did I tell you?

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.400
When you get mad, sing a little tune
or remember your favorite song.

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:23.720
I will. Otherwise I'll explode.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:31.200
Flowers bloom in the valley
That which gives us love

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.560
Super song.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:38.160
Its dark morning glow shines like dawn

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:42.960
The valley's honey
More fragrant than the meadow

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.480
Lacko finally did it.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.920
He learned to ride the anger wheel
and control it.

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.560
Try it for yourselves.

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:59.480
In the valley, a person protects himself

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:05.160
Every tree, every meadow is a rare remedy

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.880
In the valley, people have no walls

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.520
Their hearts are clean
And kind like a river

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:25.760
A countryside guarded
By mountains and warm valleys

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:33.200
When the sun sings upon
Herds of spring sheep

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.240
That's the countryside
Where the morning wakes early

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:39.400
And the wood from the mountains
Silently unites

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:46.240
It's the magic of Slovakia
That I love with pride
