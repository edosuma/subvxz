OLDER TED: So, kids, would you like to
hear the story of the time I went deaf?

00:19.252 --> 00:21.379
- Why does he even ask?
- I know, he's just gonna tell us anyway.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.649
I sure am. It all began

00:23.757 --> 00:26.123
<i>when Robin strolled into the bar</i>
<i>and said,,,</i>

00:26.226 --> 00:28.194
- Say you're my bitch.
- I'm your bitch.

00:28.294 --> 00:29.522
Why this time?

00:29.729 --> 00:33.995
Because tonight,
I am getting us all into Okay.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.034
Okay? Awesome!

00:36.269 --> 00:38.237
What's going on? Did I just have a stroke?

00:38.772 --> 00:40.103
Okay is the name of a club.

Yeah, it's supposed to be
incredibly exclusive.

outside for two hours, couldn't get in.

A friend of yours named you?

00:47.414 --> 00:50.008
No, a friend of mine named, shut up!

00:50.717 --> 00:52.207
Yeah, well, the owner goes to my gym.

00:52.318 --> 00:55.481
It turns out that he is a fan
of my reporting for Metro News 1.

00:55.588 --> 00:58.785
- So now I'm on the list for tonight.
- Nice going, Scherbatsky.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.827
You're becoming a long-and-difficult-
to-spell household name.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.893
He's even getting me into the VIP room.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.433
Yeah, he just wants to show you his
own VIP, if you know what I mean.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.899
All right, what does VIP stand for
in your little universe?

01:13.106 --> 01:15.131
Well, I know that the P is Penis.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.703
Right, so you guys are in.
Should I invite Marshall and Lily?

Claire's my age, and she and her husband
do all this classy grown-up stuff.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.381
Maybe we should start doing
some grown-up stuff.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.982
That's some pretty grown-up stuff
we did this morning.

02:02.088 --> 02:05.615
Yeah, but it wasn't classy.

a winetasting party.

signing him up for book clubs,

- cooking classes.
- All the things you do when you know

02:21.407 --> 02:23.671

are coming from.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.145
So, no, Lily and Marshall
will not be joining us.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.076
Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.706
My friend Kelly's gonna be there.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.275
- Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love.
- Oh, you are gonna love Kelly.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.981
She's fun, she's smart,
she lives in the moment.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.685
Translation: She's ugly, she's ugly,
she ugs in the ugly.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.762
- Oh, and she's totally hot.
- Okay.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.127
I guess I could take her off your hands
for an evening.

02:46.232 --> 02:48.666
So, do you have any other
hot single friends?

02:48.768 --> 02:50.759
No. Kelly works in...

02:53.039 --> 02:55.507
- Oh, no, Ted! Your blazer.
- What? What? What?

02:55.608 --> 02:58.338
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it.
Love it.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.604

Hey, we're wearing the same shirt.

One of the 24 similarities
between girls and fish

Who knew being in a committed
heterosexual relationship

04:10.750 --> 04:13.844
The question is, do these strategies
ever not work for me?

Either way, the answer's
about half the time.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.803
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

15:05.170 --> 15:09.698
These clubs are supposed to be fun, right?
Why do I hate them so much?

15:09.808 --> 15:14.040
Because all of the stuff
you're supposed to like, usually sucks.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.215
Like these clubs. Or cruises.

15:17.683 --> 15:21.949
- Or New Year's Eve.
- Or the Super Bowl.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.987
- Or parades.
- The Rockettes.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.082
- Or parades.
- You said that already.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.991
- I really hate parades.
- Okay.

15:31.964 --> 15:36.230
He just left in the middle of our own party.
You don't do that.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.331
Unless, of course,
you're chasing after somebody

15:39.438 --> 15:42.601
who's already done it,
and then I think it's okay.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.705
Well, I hate to take his side.
But, come on, a winetasting?

15:46.812 --> 15:49.406
What's the big plan for next Saturday?
Scrabble night?

15:50.249 --> 15:51.978
Don't check your email.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.582
Why are you becoming this person?

15:54.687 --> 15:58.282
I heard that in college you flashed
a campus tour group on a dare.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.826
Once on a dare.
The other times were just for fun.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.363
I'm not in college anymore.

16:05.531 --> 16:10.195
I'd love to go back and be that person
again, but you can't move backwards.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.237
- You can only go forward.
- False.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.334
You can go wherever you want.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.500
I guess, the question is,
where do you want to go?

16:17.609 --> 16:20.510
I want to go into this club
and find my fiancé.

16:20.846 --> 16:25.215
- Well, that you can't do.
- You wanna bet?

16:26.051 --> 16:27.746
Follow my lead.

16:29.121 --> 16:30.611
Hey, big guy.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.890
I said, follow my lead.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.057
- Yes, please, please.
- Do it, do it.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.653
- Follow her lead.
- You have to. Follow it.

16:39.765 --> 16:40.857
Please.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.338
Those were the four greatest
and only breasts I have ever seen.

16:53.712 --> 16:57.580
Yeah. See, if everyone keeps telling you
something is supposed to be fun,

16:57.683 --> 16:58.809
it's usually not.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.009
- Right.
- Right.

17:00.119 --> 17:03.919
So by that logic, if you and I were to,
say, go out on a date...

17:05.290 --> 17:08.191
Well, then we couldn't go anywhere
that's supposed to be fun.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.420
Right. The DMV it is.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.064
- Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.
- Sounds awful. It's a date.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.132
Okay.

17:14.233 --> 17:18.567
But there's still one big question
that needs to be answered.

17:20.071 --> 17:23.234
How many of these coats do you think
I could put on all at once?

17:26.678 --> 17:30.011
I'll go this way, you go that way.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.045
Okay. For the wedge.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.792
Barney?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.971
- Barney.
- Ted.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.141
- Get your coat, we're leaving.
- What?

18:36.248 --> 18:39.411
What happened to that cutlet
you were grinding with?

18:39.618 --> 18:42.416
- That was my cousin Leslie.
- What?

18:42.521 --> 18:46.082
No. No. No.
We are not laughing about this, Ted.

18:46.191 --> 18:49.592
This is not gonna be some funny story
that we'll be telling in a couple months.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.323
It's not going to be like,
"Hey, remember that time

18:52.431 --> 18:54.797
"when you were grinding with..." No!

18:55.534 --> 18:56.694
And you know why?

18:56.802 --> 19:00.636
Because, italics,
this night did not happen.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.833
And you promise me
that you will never, ever, ever tell

19:03.942 --> 19:06.308
another living soul
what transpired here tonight.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.437
- You promise. Promise.
- All right, I promise.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.641
Let's get Marshall and go, okay?

19:11.917 --> 19:15.409
Hey, thanks for saving my night.
I'll talk to you soon?

19:16.722 --> 19:19.247
- Hey, tip her, Barney.
- Why? I didn't check a coat.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.485
And even if I did, on principle
tip jars have become so...

19:21.593 --> 19:23.493
Funny story. Barney was grinding
with this girl all night...

19:23.595 --> 19:24.857
Fine!

19:25.864 --> 19:26.888
Just...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.900
That's a handy new trick.

19:42.648 --> 19:45.208
<i>So Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>rediscovered their youth,</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:47.679
<i>It was nice,</i>

19:48.520 --> 19:51.512
<i>And then it got,,, icky,</i>

20:00.532 --> 20:03.626
(YELLING) I'm really glad
you guys came out tonight!

20:05.938 --> 20:08.498
(YELLING) You know, dude,
can I just say something?

20:09.608 --> 20:12.509
It kind of hurt that you guys
didn't invite me out.

20:12.978 --> 20:16.277
I mean, I know things have changed
since I got engaged,

20:16.415 --> 20:18.508
but it would've been nice to be asked.

20:18.617 --> 20:23.054
- I'm sorry! I assumed you had other plans.
- They played some good songs tonight.

20:23.722 --> 20:27.419
- I mean, lately...
- I know, I know, it just, seems like

20:27.526 --> 20:30.222
suddenly we're living
in two different worlds.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.688
Maybe you've got more in common
with Barney.

20:32.798 --> 20:36.063
- What?
- Are you crazy?

20:36.168 --> 20:38.432
You think I like going to those clubs?

20:38.537 --> 20:41.700
I'd so much rather go
to your fruity little winetasting.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.365
Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf!

20:43.475 --> 20:46.876
Where's my purse, where's my...
No, I'm okay.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.349
The problem is you can't do
any of that couple stuff

20:51.450 --> 20:53.418
unless you have someone to do it with.

20:53.518 --> 20:56.043
And the only way I'm gonna find
that someone is by going out

20:56.154 --> 20:58.987
- and doing stupid single stuff with Barney.
- What?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.926
But, man, when I find her

21:04.363 --> 21:07.230
we're gonna have some
bad-ass winetastings.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.127
It's a plan.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.636
Hey, maybe it'll be
that cute coat-check girl.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.639
Yeah. Maybe it will be.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.068
<i>It wasn't,</i>

21:19.511 --> 21:22.344
You know, Ted.
I don't say this nearly enough

21:22.447 --> 21:25.507
- but I really value...
- Hey, that place has great salads.
