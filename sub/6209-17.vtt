00:02.269 --> 00:03.737
Sabrina, it's
Valentine's Day.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.839
You should definitely wear red
to the dance.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.308
Yeah, 'cause no one else
will have that idea.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.112
Sabrina:
Hey, there's Ken.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.280
I'll bet he followed you here.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.015
Stop it.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.016
Hi, Ken.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.351
Valerie!

00:17.351 --> 00:18.218
What do you think?

00:18.218 --> 00:19.720
Picture it with a wonderbra.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.721
( <i>Valerie giggles</i> )

00:22.489 --> 00:23.390
He loves you.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.592
Yeah, and that was him
asking me to marry him.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.595
Hey, Val, you should get
this dress for the dance.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.430
That way you'll be ready
if, uh...

00:30.430 --> 00:31.999
let's see,
who might ask you?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.200
Kenny-poo?

00:33.800 --> 00:35.636
This <i>is</i> a great dress.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.704
Oh, look
at the price. Ouch.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.306
Oh, well, my mom's
plaid formal

00:39.306 --> 00:41.241
has a certain charm.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.009
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:48.181 --> 00:51.418
Oh! Now, I didn't do that.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.689
Hey, Val,
you didn't see this tag.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.090
Wow, 20% off!

00:57.090 --> 00:58.292
Hey with a sale like this

00:58.292 --> 01:00.794
I might be able to afford
an even better dress.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.729
Val, this one.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.164
I-I think it's a
president's day sale

01:04.164 --> 01:07.234
and all the other
dresses are... canadian.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.822
Do you like my weddin' dress?

01:35.028 --> 01:36.196
Sabrina:
<i>On my way, Val</i>

01:36.196 --> 01:37.731
as soon as I find
my red sweater.

01:38.832 --> 01:39.600
I'm reading.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.603
Yes, I've been listening
to what you said.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.939
Let me recap:
"Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken."

01:45.939 --> 01:46.907
See ya.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.277
Salem, my sweater!

01:50.277 --> 01:51.445
Did you do this?

01:51.445 --> 01:54.281
Hey, I was as shocked as you.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.452
We have a major
moth problem.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.553
Oh, by the way

01:59.553 --> 02:02.255
Zelda and I are chaperoning
the school dance Friday.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.223
What?!

02:03.223 --> 02:04.958
Why don't you just hang
a big "nerd girl" sign

02:04.958 --> 02:05.926
around my neck?

02:05.926 --> 02:06.426
Okay.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.532
Nobody likes a house where
you can't speak figuratively.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.433
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

02:15.802 --> 02:17.004
Hello, Sabrina.

02:17.004 --> 02:17.938
Um, actually, I was...

02:17.938 --> 02:20.173
My aunt Hilda is
right in there.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.276
Oh, you've dropped your...

02:23.276 --> 02:24.978
"nerd girl" sign.

02:26.013 --> 02:26.913
Zelda:
What can we
do for you

02:26.913 --> 02:27.848
Mr. Kraft?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.783
Um, well, uh, I heard
you were chaperoning

02:29.783 --> 02:32.686
so I thought I'd drop off
the dance rules.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.087
Ok then be careful driving home.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.023
Our street tends
to be slick.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.092
You know, I will be at
the dance myself, and...

02:39.092 --> 02:39.660
I was just thinking

02:39.660 --> 02:42.729
you know, if the kids
are under control, and...

02:42.729 --> 02:43.797
there's a slow dance...?

02:43.797 --> 02:46.533
Especially watch the dip
at the bottom of the hill.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.868
It's very dangerous.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.735
Okay, I will.

02:48.735 --> 02:49.936
And thanks
for the rules.

02:49.936 --> 02:53.507
We'll make sure there's no...
racketeering?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.276
We have to get dates,
or you have to kill me.

03:00.781 --> 03:01.948
Do you have
any more money?

03:01.948 --> 03:03.383
We don't have enough
for a tip.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.484
I think
I'm wiped out.

03:04.484 --> 03:05.218
Let me see.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.454
There. 50 cents.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.655
Think it's the thought
that counts?

03:08.655 --> 03:10.157
( <i>sighs</i> )

03:10.157 --> 03:11.324
Hi, Mrs. Popowski.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.993
Salinas.

03:12.993 --> 03:16.163
Wow! Two whole quarters.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.498
Won't have to sweat
the rent this month.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.367
Emergency!

03:20.367 --> 03:21.068
We just ran
out of money

03:21.068 --> 03:23.236
and for once,
I'm actually being fun.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.472
We're tapped out.
Oh...

03:25.472 --> 03:27.007
Great. Ken's leaving.

03:29.109 --> 03:29.843
( <i>bell dings</i> )

03:31.778 --> 03:32.746
Hey, Val! We won

03:32.746 --> 03:33.847
some free ones.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.616
I shall have to postpone
my victory dance!

03:36.616 --> 03:38.285
Ooh! My lucky day.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.121
Got to call the mister.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.823
It's steak tonight.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.330
Where's my algebra book?

03:50.330 --> 03:51.331
( <i>bell dings</i> )

03:51.331 --> 03:53.166
Looking
for this?

03:53.166 --> 03:54.568
Roland!?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.836
Give me that!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.604
You're a finder, not a taker.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.605
Not anymore.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.307
I've changed careers.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.608
I'm an equalizer.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.610
By the way,
you look lovely.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.544
A what?

04:04.544 --> 04:05.779
An equalizer.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.048
You take from someone,
I take from you.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.750
It evens things out
in the universe.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.418
And this job has dental.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.886
What have taken?

04:12.886 --> 04:15.689
Well, let's see,you took 20% off
a dress

04:15.689 --> 04:17.224
I took 20%
of your sweater.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.894
You took pinball games,
I took your algebra book.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.198
Sabrina,
who is <i>this</i> gentleman?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.934
Roland, m-my... cousin.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.270
And who's this bozo?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.105
Your new <i>boyfriend?</i>

04:32.105 --> 04:34.374
Our vice-principal.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.042
Roland

04:36.042 --> 04:37.110
perhaps you missed

04:37.110 --> 04:39.713
the sign stating
that all visitors

04:39.713 --> 04:41.047
must report to the office

04:41.047 --> 04:44.351
before wandering aimlessly
around the school grounds.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.887
Are you implying
that I can't read?

04:46.887 --> 04:47.921
Oh!

04:47.921 --> 04:49.823
Sorry, he's
hypoglycemic.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.024
Nurse!

04:51.424 --> 04:53.226
I want my
sweater fixed.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.528
Hey, Sabrina...

04:54.528 --> 04:57.097
oh, look who it is.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.932
Farm boy.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.434
Isn't this your aunts' friend
that I met last year?

05:01.434 --> 05:02.936
If that's who
I said he was.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.372
Want to make something of it,
farm boy?

05:05.372 --> 05:06.540
Not really.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.141
I just wanted
to tell Sabrina

05:08.141 --> 05:09.843
something about the dance
on Friday.

05:09.843 --> 05:13.213
Ooh! Are we going
to the dance together?

05:13.213 --> 05:14.681
Mind if I throw up?

05:15.849 --> 05:16.983
What I wanted to tell you
was that...

05:16.983 --> 05:18.518
( <i>bell dings</i> )

05:18.518 --> 05:19.853
I can't go to the dance.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.354
I have to accompany my dad

05:21.354 --> 05:24.124
to a termite convention.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.793
I can't believe
I forgot about it.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.529
I don't even remember
hearing about it.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.168
Okay, we're
up to the "Z's"

05:35.168 --> 05:36.603
and so far,
every man we know

05:36.603 --> 05:40.073
is either married, busy
or disgusting.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.842
Several were all three.

05:43.810 --> 05:44.911
What's wrong with you?

05:44.911 --> 05:47.113
You've got a date
for Valentine's Day.

05:47.113 --> 05:47.781
Not anymore.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.282
I'm being equalized.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.016
( <i>gasps</i> )

05:50.016 --> 05:53.253
Oh, please say you didn't
take anyone's pet.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.555
So I wasn't
stealing, per se.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.090
I was just trying
to help Valerie.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.492
We understand, but
it was still wrong.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.528
I took Belgium once
to help Napoleon.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.996
Big trouble.

06:02.996 --> 06:03.864
What do I do?

06:03.864 --> 06:04.898
I have to get rid of Roland.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.333
He still wants to marry me.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.135
You have to give back
the things you took.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.804
Ok,I'll zap the dress
into the store

06:10.804 --> 06:12.472
and some money
into the pinball machine

06:12.472 --> 06:13.807
and good-bye
love-smitten equalizer.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.875
No, it's not that easy.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.842
When you're equalizing

06:15.842 --> 06:18.111
you have to put
forth <i>more</i> effort.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.747
Basically,
you have to give
things back by hand.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.349
Which is how
I came to participate

06:22.349 --> 06:22.816
in a little thing

06:22.816 --> 06:24.150
called Waterloo.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.520
Let me get this straight.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.956
You felt so bad
about the other night

06:29.956 --> 06:33.460
that you came all the way
down here to give me money

06:33.460 --> 06:36.129
to give
to the pinball machine man.

06:36.129 --> 06:36.863
If you don't mind.

06:36.863 --> 06:39.332
No, of course not.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.569
The pinball man is always
running himself ragged

06:42.569 --> 06:44.671
bringing you kids
extra napkins

06:44.671 --> 06:46.873
or refilling
your free drinks.

06:46.873 --> 06:51.678
No one works harder
than the pinball machine man.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.579
Great!

06:52.579 --> 06:53.747
So you don't mind.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.249
Zelda:
<i>Well, I think we should.</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:57.584
I'm against it.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.185
That guy gives me
the willies.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.321
Fine. You're the one
who wants a date.

07:01.321 --> 07:01.922
You're right.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.723
Okay, let's do it.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.158
"Love is special,
love is alive.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.394
Send me cupid for 5.95."

07:08.295 --> 07:10.563
( <i>sobbing</i> )

07:10.563 --> 07:11.731
You look awful.

07:11.731 --> 07:12.465
Hilda.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.067
It's his busy
time of year.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.068
Oh, that's not it.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.670
I was just left
at the altar.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.306
My fiance ran off
with a policeman.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.875
She never could resist
a man in clothes.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.843
You wore that
to get married?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.178
It's a formal wedding.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.379
Had enough.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.782
Getting out
of the love business.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.251
It's time to resign ourselves
to the obvious.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.353
We're not meant to have dates
for this dance.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.121
Well, maybe you can,
but I can't.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.091
Not with Willard Kraft
and his binaca breath.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.627
I'll bet I can get him
to snap out of it.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.662
Come on, cupie.

07:42.662 --> 07:43.897
How much did you
really like her?

07:43.897 --> 07:47.901
( <i>sobbing</i> )

07:47.901 --> 07:48.768
There you go.

07:48.768 --> 07:49.970
One debt erased.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.771
But I can't ask Valerie
to return the dress.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.506
She loves it too much.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.808
You could sew a duplicate.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.043
Sew? I can't even
staple correctly.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.511
Sewing's easy.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.214
I just sewed a bedskirt
last weekend.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.050
Do your aunts have
a sewing room?

08:04.050 --> 08:06.820
In the dungeon
next to the bomb shelter.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.391
A spinning wheel?

08:11.391 --> 08:12.726
What, a loom is
too high-tech?

08:12.726 --> 08:13.994
I can't do this.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.362
All witches can spin.

08:15.362 --> 08:18.698
Just sit down and give it
a whirl, so to speak.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.767
Why do I have the eerie feeling
you're going to tell me

08:20.767 --> 08:21.167
your real name

08:21.167 --> 08:23.770
is Rumpelstiltskin?

08:23.770 --> 08:27.007
<i>This</i> will make you
believe in love again.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.510
"What can you say about
a 25-year-old girl who died?"

08:30.510 --> 08:31.244
Good riddance.

08:31.244 --> 08:31.945
( <i>phone rings</i> )

08:31.945 --> 08:33.079
Wow!

08:34.547 --> 08:35.849
Hello?

08:35.849 --> 08:36.883
Hi, Valerie.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.685
I'll call Sabrina.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.786
Sabrina?

08:39.786 --> 08:41.287
She's in the dungeon
with Roland.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.355
Zelda: In the dungeon?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.557
Yeah,is there any leftover pie?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.160
Hmm, Valerie,
she'll call you back.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.495
Hey!

08:48.495 --> 08:50.063
Yes, there's pie.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.900
This is great.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.269
I think I may have
found my old age hobby.

08:59.672 --> 09:00.607
Wow, I never noticed

09:00.607 --> 09:03.610
how inviting
this spinning wheel spindle is.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.944
Do you think it will prick me?

09:04.944 --> 09:07.347
Nah. Give it a try.

09:19.692 --> 09:23.897
...and this is my lovely bride.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.534
All:
Ooh!

09:27.534 --> 09:30.770
( <i>snorts</i> )

09:33.106 --> 09:34.641
Touch it!

09:34.641 --> 09:35.975
Touch it!

09:36.242 --> 09:38.078
( <i>gasping</i> ):
Stop!

09:38.078 --> 09:40.847
How dare you try to
prick Sabrina's finger on that
spindel

09:40.847 --> 09:42.449
so you could
run off with her.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.316
What?!

09:43.316 --> 09:45.819
I was only going to keep her
for a century or two.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.686
<i>What?!</i>

09:46.686 --> 09:47.554
You know very well

09:47.554 --> 09:49.589
that sleeping beauty spells
are illegal

09:49.589 --> 09:52.025
ever since, well...
sleeping beauty.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.561
Hold it.Roland, I thought
we settled this last time.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.529
I'm not interested
in marrying you.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.397
Dating?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.134
Fine! But we're
still not square.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.504
"See how she lays her hand
upon her cheek."

10:04.504 --> 10:05.939
Ken just found out
he got the part of Romeo

10:05.939 --> 10:07.307
in the school play.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.842
How can you tell?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.176
He's so much fun.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.611
I wish he'd ask me
to the dance.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.046
Why don't you ask him?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.380
Because if he doesn't ask me

10:14.380 --> 10:16.149
I can always assume
that it slipped his mind

10:16.149 --> 10:18.618
but if I ask him,
and he says "no"

10:18.618 --> 10:20.420
no amount of delusion
will fix it.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.856
Tell you what,why don't I feel
him out for you.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.091
As long as you lie
about anything negative.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.126
Absolutely.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.028
Hi, Ken.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.497
Sabrina.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.699
"What light through
yonder window breaks?"

10:32.699 --> 10:34.434
Uh, explosion
in the chem lab?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.936
Listen, I was just wondering
if you were taking anyone

10:36.936 --> 10:38.471
to the dance on Friday.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.773
Sabrina,I'd lovest to go.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.876
Thou hast
stolen my heart.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.576
No...

10:44.844 --> 10:46.079
Valerie!

10:48.047 --> 10:49.549
Valerie...

10:49.849 --> 10:50.750
( <i>bell dings</i> )

10:50.750 --> 10:52.986
Stole a mortal's heart, eh?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.454
No, he was just goofing.

10:54.454 --> 10:59.225
Sabrina, you took his heart,
I'm taking yours.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.360
( <i>bell dings</i> )

11:00.360 --> 11:01.060
( <i>gasping</i> )

11:03.363 --> 11:05.798
Still need
that hall pass, mister.

11:10.270 --> 11:15.208
And now, your heart
belongs to me.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.480
Sabrina, are you going
to the dance with Ken?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.882
Wait for me, my darling!

11:26.319 --> 11:28.955
Okay... you can look.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.759
I love it!

11:33.126 --> 11:34.928
It's not as big
as a castle

11:34.928 --> 11:37.797
but Ijust feel more at home
under a bridge.

11:37.797 --> 11:38.865
What's that sound?

11:39.032 --> 11:39.398
( <i>hooves pounding</i> )

11:39.398 --> 11:41.700
Oh, that's just the
billy goats crossing.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.734
You'll get
used to it.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.836
It's like living
near an airport.

11:44.836 --> 11:46.171
( <i>giggles</i> )

11:46.171 --> 11:48.040
Who's this?

11:48.040 --> 11:51.476
Oh, um, that's just
my old girlfriend, Thumbelina.

11:51.476 --> 11:53.011
Well, the picture has to go.

11:53.011 --> 11:54.279
You're
all mine now.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.281
Yes, ma'am!

11:57.015 --> 11:59.584
So, um, what do you
want to do?

12:00.152 --> 12:02.054
Gaze lovingly into your eyes.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.588
Okay.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.028
Oh, come on.

12:10.028 --> 12:11.296
You've got
to cheer up.

12:11.296 --> 12:12.464
I mean I need a date.

12:12.464 --> 12:14.666
and... I need a date!

12:17.135 --> 12:19.638
So, how goes it
with diaper Dan?

12:19.638 --> 12:21.907
It's more challenging
than building the Panama canal

12:21.907 --> 12:24.109
but then, less malaria.

12:25.377 --> 12:26.745
Look.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.880
What? You're
fighting a yawn?

12:29.381 --> 12:30.582
A smile.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.250
Y-you told a joke and...

12:32.250 --> 12:33.485
it made me smile.

12:33.485 --> 12:35.320
I've seen bigger
on a lutheran.

12:35.687 --> 12:37.255
I-I can't believe it!

12:37.255 --> 12:39.157
I thought I'd never
smile again.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.325
You're cured!

12:40.325 --> 12:41.893
Hallelujah!

12:42.627 --> 12:45.097
Now, there's the most
adorable fireman

12:45.097 --> 12:46.365
down the street.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.101
And I owe it all
to you...

12:49.101 --> 12:51.336
Hilda...

12:51.336 --> 12:52.771

Uh-oh.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.607

12:58.577 --> 12:59.277
Hello, Hilda.

12:59.277 --> 13:00.912
Oh great!
One more gentleman caller

13:00.912 --> 13:02.681
and we can just put on
<i>the Glass Menagerie.</i>

13:02.681 --> 13:04.616
Who's he?
Who's <i>he?!</i>

13:04.616 --> 13:06.318
I am someone who has
the decency

13:06.318 --> 13:08.653
not to wear a diaper
in front of a lady.

13:08.653 --> 13:09.654
What...?

13:09.654 --> 13:12.023
Oh...!

13:12.023 --> 13:13.258
Get your
hands off her...

13:14.025 --> 13:15.727
Willard,
what do you want?

13:15.727 --> 13:19.097
Well, I came to speak to you

13:19.097 --> 13:21.266
about your niece's strange
behavior in school

13:21.266 --> 13:22.267
with her cousin.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.436
Both:
Cousin?

13:24.436 --> 13:25.804
Roland.
Roland.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.406
I had a feeling
about this.

13:27.406 --> 13:28.807
I'm going
to call Valerie.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.144
I'll help her.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.258
Afraid to show your legs?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.326
Nice perm.

13:49.327 --> 13:50.996
She's not
at Valerie's.

13:50.996 --> 13:51.997
The other realm.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.198
Let's go.

13:53.198 --> 13:55.734
( <i>groaning</i> )

13:56.201 --> 13:57.669
You... go.

13:57.669 --> 13:59.471
<i>You...</i> come.

14:01.706 --> 14:03.508
But why does he
get to...?

14:04.242 --> 14:06.745
Oh... man!

14:09.080 --> 14:11.049
Why did you bring <i>him</i> along?

14:11.049 --> 14:13.318
So we could use
the carpool lane.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.992
I made you a personal
pan pizza.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.160
Is there anything
else I can do

14:22.160 --> 14:23.628
to make you
ecstatically happy?

14:23.628 --> 14:25.697
Uh... pepper flakes?

14:25.931 --> 14:27.299
Cupid:
Wait up, Hildie!

14:27.299 --> 14:28.066
Hilda:
Go away!

14:28.667 --> 14:30.802
Zelda:
Maybe we should have
ditched him at Stuckey's.

14:30.802 --> 14:32.537
That sounds like my aunts.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.774
Aunt Zelda.

14:36.608 --> 14:37.375
Aunt Hilda.

14:38.643 --> 14:39.144
Cupid?

14:39.144 --> 14:41.112
He's in love with me.
Ignore him.

14:41.112 --> 14:42.514
We're here
to rescue you.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.883
Rescue me?
But I love it here.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.085
I love
this moldy home.

14:47.085 --> 14:48.353
I love Roland.

14:48.353 --> 14:50.222
Okay. What have you
done to her?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.491
I think I know,
sweetie.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.159
I <i>am</i> in the love biz.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.862
He's taken... her heart.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.430
It was a fair deal.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.866
She stole a boy's heart,
I took hers.

15:00.866 --> 15:03.502
You are not allowed
to equalize for your
own benefit.

15:03.502 --> 15:04.970
Give it
back-- now.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.705
No, I don't want it back.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.241
I want my Rolly to keep it
forever and ever.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.376
Did you also give her
a saccharine pill?

15:11.376 --> 15:13.378
Sabrina has spoken.

15:13.378 --> 15:15.146
Now if you'll excuse us

15:15.146 --> 15:18.149
the ogre and his lady friend
are coming over for dinner.

15:18.149 --> 15:20.352
And there's not enough
entrails for everyone.

15:28.693 --> 15:29.761
Hilda!

15:29.761 --> 15:31.029
Love of my life!

15:31.029 --> 15:32.731
Oh, no.
Not another one.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.165
Roland!

15:34.165 --> 15:35.267
Sabrina!

15:35.267 --> 15:36.935
The other love of my life.

15:36.935 --> 15:42.274
( <i>whimpering</i> )

15:42.274 --> 15:44.843
( <i>screaming</i> ):
Help me!

15:44.843 --> 15:46.545
I love you!

15:46.545 --> 15:48.813
But I still love <i>you.</i>

15:48.813 --> 15:50.549
Why did you hit me
with that arrow?

15:50.549 --> 15:52.551
So that you would see
it's wrong to mess

15:52.551 --> 15:53.885
with people's hearts.

15:53.885 --> 15:56.254
Unless you're
a licensed
professional.

15:56.821 --> 16:00.392
Give Sabrina's
heart back-- now.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.159
I will.

16:01.159 --> 16:02.661
If you'll grant me one favor.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.497
It better not involve me
and a trip to make-out point.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.066
I will grant you
one request--
within reason--

16:08.066 --> 16:09.801
but first, the heart.

16:09.801 --> 16:11.636
No, I don't care
if he does love Hilda.

16:11.636 --> 16:13.805
I still want Roland.

16:13.805 --> 16:16.308
Away from me!
Yuck!

16:16.308 --> 16:17.509
I can't believe
I was eating soup

16:17.509 --> 16:18.910
out of a
sheep's stomach!

16:18.910 --> 16:20.545
You sure you don't want to stay?

16:20.545 --> 16:21.279
Very sure.

16:21.279 --> 16:22.948
But if I change my mind
about living in hell

16:22.948 --> 16:24.950
with a man I can't stand,
I'll let you know.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.284
I'm out of here.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.920
How about <i>you?</i>

16:28.920 --> 16:30.689
Not if you were the last troll
living under

16:30.689 --> 16:31.957
a bridge on earth.

16:32.624 --> 16:33.024
Don't worry.

16:33.024 --> 16:34.993
It was only a cheapo
infatuation arrow.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.194
It will wear off
by sundown.

16:36.194 --> 16:36.761
Good.

16:36.761 --> 16:39.631
My feelings, however,
are the real thing.

16:40.765 --> 16:43.401
Now, Roland,
what is your request?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.238
Granted.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.809
( <i>up-tempo dance music plays)</i>

16:50.809 --> 16:52.677
Can't believe aunt Zelda
granted your wish

16:52.677 --> 16:53.945
to come to one dance
with me.

16:53.945 --> 16:55.180
Want me to spin you again?

16:55.180 --> 16:58.183
No! I'm still mad at you
for taking Harvey away.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.285
Boy, you really know
how to hold a grudge.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.786
I'm going to go request
another disco song

17:01.786 --> 17:03.521
so we can <i>bump.</i>

17:04.522 --> 17:06.257
So how's your date
working out?

17:06.257 --> 17:06.958
Okay.

17:06.958 --> 17:09.527
He's not so bad
once you puts pants on him.

17:10.328 --> 17:12.163
Zelda:
Yeah. Maybe
he should have

17:12.163 --> 17:14.366
taken the diaper
off first.

17:14.499 --> 17:18.103
( <i>disco music plays</i> )

17:21.039 --> 17:21.640
Hi.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.841
Hi.

17:22.841 --> 17:23.541
Listen, Val, I...

17:23.541 --> 17:25.610
Look, Sabrina,
I'm not mad at you.

17:25.610 --> 17:27.579
It's not your fault
Ken doesn't like me.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.814
Believe or not, I don't think
it's my fault.

17:29.814 --> 17:30.915
Good for you!

17:30.915 --> 17:32.817
Hey, if you want to dance,
I'll share Roland.

17:32.817 --> 17:33.852
In fact, I'll give you
five bucks

17:33.852 --> 17:35.453
to take him
off my hands.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.123
Great.

17:38.123 --> 17:38.923
There's Ken.

17:39.824 --> 17:41.259
How did you spot him?

17:42.927 --> 17:44.162
Miss Birckhead...

17:44.162 --> 17:45.630
this is a social event.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.733
It is <i>not</i> a place
for conversation.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.869
Will you stop that?

17:50.869 --> 17:52.270
I know these
are practical

17:52.270 --> 17:55.173
but, darn it,
fashion means
something to me.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.442
Mind if I borrow
your date?

17:57.442 --> 17:59.377
Okay, but bring him
back if there's
a slow song.

17:59.377 --> 18:00.779
I don't want
to look like a loser.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.082
Okay. See that
girl over there?
Yeah.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.283
Okay, I want you
to work your magic

18:05.283 --> 18:07.585
to make <i>him</i>
attracted to her.

18:07.819 --> 18:10.121
Oh, shoot! You didn't
bring your arrows.

18:10.121 --> 18:11.189
Hilda wouldn't
let me.

18:11.322 --> 18:14.325
Never fear.
I brought a pea shooter

18:14.325 --> 18:15.560
and love peas.

18:17.495 --> 18:18.296
Can't do it.

18:18.296 --> 18:19.964
It'd be a waste
of a pea.

18:19.964 --> 18:21.800
You mean there's
no hope for those two?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.967
There's no need.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.270
That boy is already
crazy about that girl.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.671
He's just shy.

18:26.671 --> 18:28.640
Ken, shy?

18:28.640 --> 18:31.276
Some people cover up
shyness with bravado.

18:32.410 --> 18:35.547
Well, the job requires a certain
amount of... psychology.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.248
Well, if it's true
that Ken likes Val

18:37.248 --> 18:38.249
then maybe there
is a little something

18:38.249 --> 18:39.184
<i>I</i> can do.

18:40.485 --> 18:41.319
Want to dance?

18:42.721 --> 18:44.222
I'd love to.

18:44.222 --> 18:45.824
I've been wishing you'd ask.

18:50.061 --> 18:50.829
Miss Birckhead

18:50.829 --> 18:53.498
that punch will not
serve itself.

18:54.733 --> 18:55.400
Thanks.

18:56.668 --> 18:57.535
Excuse us.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.305
Would you give Zelda

19:00.305 --> 19:01.773
a little evening's
affection?

19:01.773 --> 19:04.008
Look, I don't want
to be working all night.

19:04.642 --> 19:05.844
But for you...

19:17.422 --> 19:18.623
oh, dear lord.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.091
Two birds
with one stone.

19:20.091 --> 19:21.593
Zelda's happy
and that goob

19:21.593 --> 19:23.294
is no longer
fishing in my creek.

19:23.294 --> 19:24.362
Gross!

19:24.362 --> 19:25.163
To what you
just said

19:25.163 --> 19:27.999
and gross to what
you just did.

19:30.401 --> 19:32.203
May I have
this dance?

19:32.203 --> 19:33.805
Oh, yes.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.341
( <i>slow, romantic music plays)</i>

19:38.810 --> 19:40.545
The deal
was one dance.

19:40.545 --> 19:43.248
I know. I want to apologize.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.785
I was wrong to try and steal
your heart through magic.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.287
I just wanted you to like me.

19:49.287 --> 19:50.288
That was nice.

19:50.288 --> 19:52.257
Roland, I like it
when you're nice.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.558
So we're engaged?!

19:53.558 --> 19:54.425
No!

19:55.727 --> 19:57.529
Look, I want to equalize

19:57.529 --> 19:58.429
what I did to you.

19:58.429 --> 20:00.498
You're going to set up
a large trust fund?

20:00.498 --> 20:01.366
No.

20:04.302 --> 20:05.937
Harvey!

20:05.937 --> 20:06.471
I can't believe

20:06.471 --> 20:07.105
I thought I had to go

20:07.105 --> 20:09.707
to a father/son
termite convention.

20:09.707 --> 20:12.143
According to my dad
there is no such thing.

20:12.143 --> 20:14.045
Now that you're here,
you want to dance?

20:14.045 --> 20:15.246
You bet.

20:15.246 --> 20:24.923
( <i>"Truly Madly Deeply"</i>
<i>by Savage Garden plays</i> )

20:46.878 --> 20:48.646
Thumby?!

21:12.904 --> 21:13.905

<i>music plays</i> )
