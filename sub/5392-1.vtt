Repeat after me, okay?

01:07.178 --> 01:09.007
Oh, Paul,
leave me alone.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.226
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

01:39.611 --> 01:40.805
Butter.

01:48.486 --> 01:50.716
Oh, my goodness.

01:51.990 --> 01:54.151
You have to taste this.

01:56.661 --> 01:57.719
Here.

02:07.105 --> 02:08.470
I mean... It's...

02:08.539 --> 02:09.801
- I know.
- But I'm...

02:09.874 --> 02:13.275
I know. I know. I know.

02:17.148 --> 02:21.448
Look at that! Oh, Paul, it's so beautiful!

02:28.460 --> 02:29.825
Slow down.

02:31.162 --> 02:32.390
Sorry.

02:41.506 --> 02:44.407
This is it. Look, right... Just stop.

02:47.045 --> 02:50.879
I can't believe we get to live here.

02:52.550 --> 02:53.881
Paul!

03:19.411 --> 03:21.572
Is this a mistake?
Should we have stayed in Brooklyn?

03:21.646 --> 03:24.581
We're gonna love Queens.
Queens is beautiful.

04:11.229 --> 04:12.992
Moving truck's here.

04:24.275 --> 04:25.537
You okay?

04:25.810 --> 04:28.540
- Everything is falling down.
- Hey.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.914
What are we doing here?

04:31.115 --> 04:32.707
Repeat after me.

04:32.784 --> 04:37.983
- Nine hundred square feet.
- Nine hundred square feet.

04:39.591 --> 04:40.990
Plus, it's close to your office.

04:41.059 --> 04:44.153
Plus, it's close to my office,
but we don't have to move.

04:44.229 --> 04:49.292
We could renege on the lease,
repack everything and live in the Jeep.

04:51.202 --> 04:54.069
You're right. You're right.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.770
- Eric, what is that noise?
- What noise?

05:01.112 --> 05:03.842
Is it going to be like this every night?

05:06.651 --> 05:07.913
Maybe.

05:13.925 --> 05:15.119
Jule?

05:17.595 --> 05:19.358
It's Versailles.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.933
I'm so happy you like it, darling.

06:43.247 --> 06:45.613
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,</i>

06:45.883 --> 06:47.043
LMDC.

06:47.485 --> 06:50.921
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
Julie Powell.

06:51.255 --> 06:56.352
<i>- My son died in the second tower.</i>
- I'm sorry.

07:00.431 --> 07:01.864
I'm so sorry.

07:03.001 --> 07:05.435
<i>Are you the person to speak to</i>
<i>if I don't like the plan for the memorial</i>

07:05.503 --> 07:08.028
<i>- that was in this morning's</i> Times?
- You can speak to me.

07:08.106 --> 07:10.438
<i>- Do you have any power?</i>
- No.

07:10.541 --> 07:14.409
<i>I wanna speak to someone with power.</i>
<i>I don't like the plan.</i>

07:14.479 --> 07:16.674
I don't like the plan either.

07:17.215 --> 07:20.446
<i>You people are a bunch of</i>
<i>heartless bureaucratic goons.</i>

07:20.518 --> 07:22.110
I am not a heartless bureaucratic goon.

07:22.186 --> 07:25.383
I am just a person in a cubicle,
and I am doing the best I can, ma'am.

07:25.456 --> 07:28.357
<i>This is my sixth phone call</i>
<i>and the only thing anyone ever tells me is</i>

07:28.426 --> 07:31.395
<i>I have to fill out a form to get in line</i>
<i>for an insurance payment.</i>

07:31.462 --> 07:35.421
And you do. But, I mean, if you don't wanna
fill out a form I will fill one out for you,

07:35.500 --> 07:37.559
but you're still going to have to come in
and sign it.

07:37.635 --> 07:40.468
<i>- To your cubicle?</i>
- Yes.

07:41.739 --> 07:44.299
I feel terrible about what you're going
through, Mr. Diamond, but...

07:44.375 --> 07:47.401
<i>You have no idea what I'm going</i>
<i>through, Ms. Powell. You have no idea.</i>

07:47.578 --> 07:50.479
- Please don't yell at me.
<i>- This whole thing is completely inefficient.</i>

07:50.581 --> 07:52.014
- Please stop yelling at me.
<i>- It's ridiculous.</i>

07:52.083 --> 07:54.608
<i>- My 3-year-old is more capable of helping.</i>
- I am your friend.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.481
<i>And now the doctor says there's fiberglass</i>
<i>in his lungs.</i>

07:59.590 --> 08:04.584
<i>He coughs. He never stops coughing.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

08:04.729 --> 08:07.061
His wife says there's so much crap
in his lungs he can't breathe,

08:07.131 --> 08:10.396
and now his insurance is refusing to pay
for this drug that might really work.

08:10.468 --> 08:13.869
- Tell her to call the Health Department.
- That's an answering machine.

08:13.938 --> 08:17.339
Andrea Gomez in the mayor's office.

08:17.675 --> 08:20.576
Thank you. Thank you.

08:33.157 --> 08:35.455
Chocolate cream pie.

08:38.496 --> 08:41.465
- You know what I love about cooking?
- What's that?

08:41.532 --> 08:43.966
I love that after a day when nothing is sure,

08:44.034 --> 08:50.304
and when I say "nothing" I mean nothing,
you can come home and absolutely know

08:50.374 --> 08:54.242
that if you add egg yolks to chocolate
and sugar and milk,

08:54.312 --> 08:57.770
it will get thick. It's such a comfort.

08:58.883 --> 09:00.180
Bad day?

09:02.320 --> 09:04.254
When will this pie be ready?

09:04.322 --> 09:06.984
Soon, but I have to make
the whipped cream first and let it set.

09:07.058 --> 09:09.549
I'll be here. It's a masterpiece.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.730
Ritual Cobb salad lunch tomorrow.

09:15.566 --> 09:17.761
Dreading, dreading, dreading.

09:20.271 --> 09:21.295
Subway.

09:21.372 --> 09:22.839
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:22.907 --> 09:24.306
How are you?

09:26.244 --> 09:27.939
What can I get for you ladies?

09:28.012 --> 09:30.037
I will have a Cobb salad, no bleu cheese.

09:30.148 --> 09:33.015
- Cobb salad, no beets.
- Cobb salad, no bacon.

09:33.084 --> 09:35.279
- Cobb salad, no eggs.
- Okay, tell them...

09:35.353 --> 09:40.290
Are you listening carefully, Tracy?
Tell them to take the offer up to 185.

09:40.424 --> 09:41.857
- Here she goes.
- Repeat after me, Tracy.

09:41.926 --> 09:43.894
- 1-8-5.
- What's going on?

09:44.929 --> 09:46.988
And call me the second you hear back.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.590
My assistant.
It's almost not worth having one.

09:50.668 --> 09:52.499
I know. Yesterday I said to Allison,

09:52.570 --> 09:54.765
"Go to the pharmacy,
get me a pair of black pantyhose."

09:54.839 --> 09:56.739
She came back and said,
"They didn't have any."

09:56.808 --> 10:01.177
I said, "Did you try another pharmacy?"
I mean, really.

10:01.245 --> 10:04.146
Or Bloomingdale's.
What's wrong with trying Bloomingdale's?

10:04.215 --> 10:06.911
Yeah, I don't get it.
If only I could be my own assistant.

10:06.984 --> 10:08.349
You can be.

10:09.086 --> 10:12.214
Fire your assistant
and don't hire a replacement.

10:12.723 --> 10:14.953
No, that's not what I mean, Julie.

10:15.026 --> 10:17.119
Excuse me. Oh...

10:17.595 --> 10:20.359
- Oh, those are cute.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

10:20.431 --> 10:25.926
Okay, tell them 190, 1-9-0. Great.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.663
"1-9-0." What? What are you up to?

10:28.739 --> 10:32.675
$190 million.
We're assembling a parcel at Midtown.

10:32.743 --> 10:35.371
Oh, wow. Oh, oh, that is so great, Cassie.

10:35.446 --> 10:37.073
A parcel of what?

10:38.282 --> 10:39.408
Buildings.

10:39.584 --> 10:42.280
We're gonna tear them all down
and put up a high-rise.

10:42.353 --> 10:43.877
- To your parcel.
- Thank you.

10:47.558 --> 10:49.992
And enough about you, here's to me.

10:50.061 --> 10:54.964
As of yesterday, I am the senior vice
president in charge of corporate publicity.

10:55.233 --> 10:56.825
- No.
- Which means I get a raise

10:56.901 --> 11:00.803
and I can borrow half a million dollars
at 2% if I want to.

11:00.905 --> 11:02.839
- Great.
- If you want to?

11:03.808 --> 11:06.572
- So how's your job, Julie?
- Oh, it's...

11:06.677 --> 11:08.770
- I can only imagine. Heartbreaking.
- So sad.

11:08.846 --> 11:10.677
- Painful.
- Not in a bad way.

11:10.781 --> 11:13.875
- Excuse me. Oh, God, I forgot.
- Excuse me.

11:14.752 --> 11:15.741
- Hello?
- Hello?

11:15.820 --> 11:16.878
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:16.954 --> 11:20.913
Hey, Jules? I have got to interview you
for this piece that I'm writing.

11:20.992 --> 11:23.688
Sure, Annabelle, great. I'd be honored.

11:24.862 --> 11:26.295
Call Julie about interview.

11:26.364 --> 11:30.095
Find out about dry cleaning.
Find out before dinner on Thursday.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.657
Saturday party.

11:33.437 --> 11:34.461
No.

11:34.538 --> 11:37.871
I cannot computer-coach you every day
while I'm with my girlfriends.

11:37.942 --> 11:40.240
What is it about? The article?

11:40.511 --> 11:44.379
It's about our generation turning 30.

11:45.283 --> 11:50.550
People turning 30. Oh, my life, I am so busy.

11:50.721 --> 11:53.713
I don't know when I can fit you in.

11:54.825 --> 11:58.591
May I remind you, I don't want to
see you, you want to see me?

11:58.696 --> 12:00.891
Yeah. Would a breakfast work?

12:04.769 --> 12:06.669
I believed her. What kind of idiot am I?

12:06.737 --> 12:10.229
She said,
"It's about our generation turning 30."

12:10.308 --> 12:12.776
What'd you expect?
Annabelle was always a liar.

12:13.010 --> 12:16.241
"Julie Powell, once the editor of
the Amherst literary magazine,

12:16.314 --> 12:18.976
"the one we all knew would be 'The One,'

12:19.116 --> 12:22.483
"temped for eight years before giving up
on her novel,

12:22.553 --> 12:25.716
"and now works in a cubicle
as a mid-level bureaucrat,

12:25.790 --> 12:29.123
"attempting to deal with
the aftereffects of 9l11."

12:29.193 --> 12:33.095
Oh, God, you memorized it? How pathetic.

12:33.264 --> 12:35.061
She left so much out.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.462
Anyway, the picture was good.

12:38.536 --> 12:40.936
- I looked fat.
- Just your face.

12:46.010 --> 12:49.502
I forgot to tell you.
Do you know what Annabelle's doing now?

12:49.580 --> 12:52.413
- Sarah told me. A blog.
- Of what?

12:52.583 --> 12:55.575
What do you mean "of what"?
A blog of Annabelle.

12:55.653 --> 12:58.349
Of every thought
that passes through her brain.

12:58.456 --> 13:01.619
Her stupid, vapid, insipid...

13:03.894 --> 13:05.691
I could write a blog.

13:06.097 --> 13:07.359
I have thoughts.

13:07.465 --> 13:10.434
And you're a writer,
which is more than I can say for Annabelle.

13:10.501 --> 13:12.867
- If only that were true.
- You wrote a novel.

13:12.937 --> 13:16.464
Half a novel.
And no one wanted to publish it.

13:16.974 --> 13:19.875
You're not a writer unless someone
publishes you.

13:19.977 --> 13:23.708
See, that's what's so great about blogs.
You don't have to be published.

13:23.781 --> 13:29.242
You can just go online,
press enter and there it is, out there.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.354
What would I write a blog about?

13:31.422 --> 13:33.185
You're an editor, tell me.

13:33.257 --> 13:36.852
Why don't you write about
how much you love Queens?

13:38.896 --> 13:40.363
A short blog.

13:42.266 --> 13:46.202
You could write about your job.

13:47.805 --> 13:50.535
If I wrote a blog about my job
and anyone at work ever read it...

13:50.608 --> 13:53.202
- I mean, hello.
- This is good.

13:53.878 --> 13:55.436
This is really good.

13:55.513 --> 13:59.415
On top of which, the whole idea of writing
a blog is to get away from what I do all day.

13:59.517 --> 14:03.112
The way that cooking is a way
that I get away from what I do all day.

14:03.187 --> 14:05.417
So write a blog about cooking.

14:07.758 --> 14:11.319
I'm not a real cook,
like Julia Child or Mario Batali.

14:11.562 --> 14:14.190
Julia Child wasn't always Julia Child.

14:19.670 --> 14:22.264
If I really wanted to learn to cook,

14:22.573 --> 14:26.031
I could just cook my way through
Julia Child's cookbook.

14:26.110 --> 14:28.078
I could blog about that.

14:28.379 --> 14:32.440
I have a copy. I stole it from my mother
last time I was in Texas.

14:34.385 --> 14:39.152
When I was eight, my father's boss came
to dinner and it was a really big deal,

14:39.223 --> 14:41.885
and my mother made <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

14:42.093 --> 14:46.757
But it wasn't just <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>
It was Julia's <i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

14:47.131 --> 14:51.591
And it was like she was there,
like Julia was there in the room,

14:52.269 --> 14:57.605
on our side like some great big good fairy.

14:58.576 --> 15:01.374
And everything was going to be all right.

15:04.915 --> 15:08.942
<i>I'm gonna try to flip this thing over now,</i>

15:09.153 --> 15:12.213
<i>which is a rather daring thing to do.</i>

15:12.823 --> 15:14.085
She changed everything.

15:14.158 --> 15:18.356
Before her, it was frozen food
and can openers and marshmallows.

15:18.429 --> 15:20.420
Don't knock marshmallows.

15:21.298 --> 15:23.323
<i>When you flip anything,</i>

15:23.434 --> 15:27.598
<i>you've just got to have the courage</i>
<i>of your convictions.</i>

15:28.005 --> 15:31.668
<i>Especially if it's a loose sort of mass like...</i>

15:31.809 --> 15:34.744
<i>That didn't go very well.</i>

15:35.112 --> 15:36.443
<i>But, you see, when I flipped it,</i>

15:36.514 --> 15:40.143
<i>- I didn't have the courage I needed...</i>
- She's so adorable.

15:40.684 --> 15:42.879
<i>... the way I should've.</i>

15:43.587 --> 15:46.385
<i>But you can always put it together.</i>

15:46.724 --> 15:51.354
<i>And you're alone in the kitchen.</i>
<i>Who's to see?</i>

15:52.630 --> 15:54.723
Pearls. The woman is wearing pearls
in the kitchen.

15:54.798 --> 15:57.961
<i>... you've just got to practice, like the piano.</i>

15:58.969 --> 16:01.062
<i>I'm Julia Child.</i>

16:01.372 --> 16:02.771
Bon appétit.

16:03.073 --> 16:05.667
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

16:06.277 --> 16:08.438
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

16:08.679 --> 16:13.082
<i>Julia Child is coauthor of the book</i>
Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

16:21.992 --> 16:23.186
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

16:26.163 --> 16:29.792
"For the servantless American cook."
That's me, all right.

16:33.904 --> 16:36.270
Okay, here's a problem.
I've never eaten an egg.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.275
And I have a hyperacidic stomach.
We'll deal.

16:40.744 --> 16:44.976
So I'll cook my way through
the Julia Child cookbook

16:45.049 --> 16:46.744
and write a blog about it.

16:46.817 --> 16:49.479
- But I'll probably need a deadline.
- Why?

16:50.020 --> 16:52.420
Because otherwise it'll be like
everything else I do.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.081
'Cause let's face it, I never finish anything.

16:54.158 --> 16:56.183
- Hey.
- Well, it's true.

16:56.894 --> 16:59.226
You know why I think it is?

16:59.330 --> 17:01.321
- ADD.
- You have ADD?

17:01.465 --> 17:04.434
Yes. That's why I'm so bad at housework.

17:05.202 --> 17:06.794
Oh, is that it?

17:07.438 --> 17:09.065
I'm just saying, a deadline would be good.

17:09.138 --> 17:10.628
So a deadline. "I love deadlines.

17:10.708 --> 17:14.165
"I love the sound they make
as they go whooshing past."

17:14.244 --> 17:16.406
<i>- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</i>
- I mean it.

17:16.480 --> 17:20.108
- Okay, so a year, or so.
- A year?

17:21.417 --> 17:23.852
This thing weighs like two pounds.

17:23.921 --> 17:29.223
I have a full-time job. Sometimes
I don't get home until 8:00 or 9:00 and...

17:29.660 --> 17:32.151
It's crazy. It's crazy.

17:32.396 --> 17:35.194
- Is it crazy?
- Yes. Yes.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.135
- Okay, you want to do Blog Z?
- Yes.

17:39.336 --> 17:40.803
Blog Z it is.

17:42.773 --> 17:44.263
Nobody here

17:45.876 --> 17:48.811
but us servantless American cooks.

17:49.046 --> 17:53.847
"Servantless American cooks."

17:54.084 --> 17:56.075
- What do you think?
- Love it.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.547
"Start blogging."

17:59.990 --> 18:02.720
<i>"The Julie/Julia Project."</i>

18:03.027 --> 18:05.996
<i>The Book,</i>
Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

18:06.063 --> 18:10.625
<i>First edition, 1961 by Simone Beck,</i>
<i>Louisette Bertholle,</i>

18:10.701 --> 18:16.037
<i>and, of course, Julia Child, the woman</i>
<i>who taught America to cook and to eat.</i>

18:17.074 --> 18:20.168
<i>It's 40 years later and no one can touch her.</i>

18:20.477 --> 18:26.245
<i>The Challenge, 365 days, 524 recipes.</i>

18:26.550 --> 18:28.780
<i>The Contender, Julie Powell.</i>

18:29.019 --> 18:31.715
<i>Government employee by day,</i>
<i>renegade foodie by night.</i>

18:31.789 --> 18:35.225
<i>Risking her marriage, her job,</i>
<i>and her cat's well-being,</i>

18:35.292 --> 18:38.318

18:38.395 --> 18:40.955
<i>How far it will go, no one can say.</i>

19:06.757 --> 19:10.750
<i>Dear Charlie, we're settled in finally,</i>
<i>and Julia loves it here.</i>

19:11.161 --> 19:13.220
<i>She wants to stay forever.</i>

19:13.797 --> 19:17.699
<i>You know how famously grouchy</i>
<i>the French can be, dear brother.</i>

19:17.768 --> 19:20.032
Everyone here is so delightful.

19:21.405 --> 19:23.965
<i>But Julia brings out the best in a polecat.</i>

19:24.041 --> 19:25.338
So charming.

19:25.409 --> 19:29.209
<i>So she thinks they're the most</i>
<i>wonderful people in the world.</i>

19:30.247 --> 19:32.943
I feel that I am French.

19:35.085 --> 19:37.986
I just must be.

19:38.922 --> 19:41.755
Well, you might be.

19:44.294 --> 19:49.288
<i>As for staying here forever,</i>
<i>I have to say, I wouldn't mind it myself.</i>

19:50.501 --> 19:51.900
And I'm so glad that you came,

19:51.969 --> 19:53.197
- I can't tell you.
- It was a very nice show.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.067
- Thanks for coming.
- I enjoyed it.

19:55.272 --> 19:59.641
- Paul, congratulations. Excellent exhibit.
- Thanks so much, Jack.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.304
Jack Donovan, this is my wife, Julia.

20:02.813 --> 20:08.080
- It was such a wonderful exhibition, Paul.
- Thank you. Thank you.

20:08.852 --> 20:12.652
- I am so proud of you.
- Oh, good.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.891
French people eat French food!

20:16.727 --> 20:21.061
- Every single day! I can't get over it.
- They do.

20:23.834 --> 20:27.964
You know I love you so much,
I'm gonna let you take the first bite.

20:28.205 --> 20:31.732
- That's so good.
- Before I even had... It's good, is it?

20:36.647 --> 20:38.945
What should I do, do you think?

20:40.350 --> 20:41.715
About what?

20:43.220 --> 20:46.519
I don't really want to go back into
government work.

20:46.924 --> 20:50.223
You know, but I...
Shouldn't I find something to do?

20:51.929 --> 20:55.387
These wives don't do anything here.

20:56.233 --> 20:59.031
- That's not me. It's just not me.
- I know.

20:59.903 --> 21:03.339
I saw a notice on the bulletin board
at the embassy

21:04.074 --> 21:06.099
for hat-making lessons.

21:09.613 --> 21:11.103
You like hats.

21:12.316 --> 21:13.681
I do, I do.

21:16.119 --> 21:17.211
I do.

21:19.857 --> 21:22.485
What is it that you really like to do?

21:23.894 --> 21:24.952
Eat.

21:27.965 --> 21:31.833
- It's what I like to do.
- I know, I know. I know. I know.

21:32.269 --> 21:34.760
- And you are so good at it. Look at you!
- I am good at it.

21:34.838 --> 21:36.897
- Now. How good you are.
- I'm growing in front of you.

21:50.721 --> 21:53.451
I was thinking of taking bridge lessons.

21:55.292 --> 21:59.888
- You like bridge.
- I do. I like the idea of bridge.

21:59.997 --> 22:03.398
Four points for an ace,
three points for a king,

22:03.467 --> 22:06.834
two points for a queen, one point for a jack.

22:07.070 --> 22:09.095
And breast your cards.

22:10.407 --> 22:14.036
Do you have any French cookbooks
in English?

22:14.645 --> 22:18.308
- I'm afraid not.
- Gosh.

22:35.098 --> 22:36.690
The salesperson. She...

22:39.670 --> 22:44.664
Had no idea... Because, you see,
there is no French cookbook in English.

22:45.008 --> 22:48.466
And all I have is this <i>Joy of Cooking</i>
by Irma Rombauer,

22:48.545 --> 22:51.844
which is an excellent, excellent cookbook,
but it's not French.

22:51.915 --> 22:54.509
So I did ask my friend Avis De Voto

22:54.618 --> 22:57.553
to look around in the United States
to see if she could find...

23:02.526 --> 23:06.053
Right. Right.

23:06.296 --> 23:10.289
Gosh, I thought I was
speaking French to you!

23:19.610 --> 23:21.339
Oh, my goodness!

23:22.946 --> 23:25.073
What do we have here?

23:25.515 --> 23:28.006
- It's a copy of...
- It's my memoirs.

23:30.220 --> 23:31.482
Oh, look.

23:32.956 --> 23:36.824
Oh, it's fantastic! But it's in French!

23:37.894 --> 23:39.657
- You'll get there. You'll get there.
- Thank you, darling.

23:39.730 --> 23:42.790
I know. I'm learning. I'm trying. I'm really...

23:43.500 --> 23:45.297
Happy birthday to me.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.733
Happy birthday.

23:50.674 --> 23:53.768
- What can this mean?
- What?

23:58.281 --> 24:02.775
- "Wash the thighs."
- No, "bathe." Bathe the thighs.

24:02.986 --> 24:06.251
- Look, but then...
- Where?

24:06.590 --> 24:09.184
"In butter." I know that. But what is the...

24:09.259 --> 24:13.161
"Bathe the thighs in butter
and then stuff the..."

24:13.230 --> 24:14.254
What's that word?

24:14.331 --> 24:16.231
- The hen!
- Right. Hen.

24:16.299 --> 24:21.669
"Until she just can't take it anymore."

24:25.108 --> 24:26.473
- It doesn't say that.
- It does.

24:26.543 --> 24:31.412
I'll show you later in the dictionary.
I'll go through the whole recipe with you.

24:32.315 --> 24:36.115
- Why don't I go to cooking school?
- Why don't you?

24:36.186 --> 24:38.677
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

24:40.223 --> 24:41.588
Oh, my God.

24:47.431 --> 24:50.229
What if you hadn't fallen in love with me?

24:51.234 --> 24:52.667
But I did.

24:58.141 --> 24:59.904
Oh, gosh.

25:08.785 --> 25:12.084
<i>Yesterday was Tuesday, August 13th, 2002.</i>

25:12.389 --> 25:15.790
<i>Day one. 364 days to go.</i>

25:17.461 --> 25:19.326
<i>I cooked artichokes with hollandaise sauce</i>

25:19.396 --> 25:23.093
<i>which is melted butter that's been whipped</i>
<i>into a frenzy with egg yolks</i>

25:23.166 --> 25:25.930
<i>until it's died and gone to heaven.</i>

25:26.303 --> 25:30.069
<i>And let me say this.</i>
<i>Is there anything better than butter?</i>

25:30.140 --> 25:31.869
<i>Think it over.</i>
<i>Every time you taste something</i>

25:31.942 --> 25:36.276
<i>that's delicious beyond imagining,</i>
<i>and you say, "What is in this?"</i>

25:36.446 --> 25:39.540
<i>The answer is always going to be "butter."</i>

25:39.750 --> 25:40.978
It's incredible.

25:41.051 --> 25:42.848
It's been whisked into submission,
that's why.

25:42.919 --> 25:46.821
<i>The day there's a meteorite heading toward</i>
<i>the earth and we have 30 days to live,</i>

25:46.890 --> 25:49.484
<i>I am going to spend it eating butter.</i>

25:50.093 --> 25:52.618
<i>Here's my final word on the subject.</i>

25:53.196 --> 25:56.859
<i>You can never have too much butter.</i>

25:58.735 --> 26:00.396
<i>August 24th, day 11.</i>

26:00.470 --> 26:03.337
Is this what you mean when you say, "Don't
crowd the mushrooms"? Is this a crowd?

26:03.406 --> 26:07.502
<i>353 days to go. A horrible day at work.</i>

26:07.677 --> 26:09.736
<i>An old grandma who looked as if</i>
<i>she wouldn't harm a fly</i>

26:09.813 --> 26:12.281
<i>called me a pencil-pushing capitalist dupe.</i>

26:12.349 --> 26:15.978
<i>But then I came home and cooked chicken</i>
<i>with cream, mushrooms and port,</i>

26:16.052 --> 26:17.952
<i>and it was total bliss.</i>

26:18.188 --> 26:19.587
<i>Here's the big news.</i>

26:19.656 --> 26:22.887
<i>I had been cooking mushrooms</i>
<i>the wrong way my entire life.</i>

26:22.959 --> 26:26.827
<i>Don't crowd the mushrooms,</i>
<i>otherwise they won't brown.</i>

26:26.897 --> 26:29.422
<i>Are you listening, whoever you are?</i>

26:30.400 --> 26:31.526
You're gonna love that one.

26:31.601 --> 26:32.795
<i>Day 22.</i>

26:32.969 --> 26:34.527
This one's really good with fig jam.

26:34.604 --> 26:38.665
<i>I got carried away in Dean & DeLuca last</i>
<i>night and spent half my take-home pay.</i>

26:38.742 --> 26:41.006
<i>And the first thing I realized</i>
<i>when I got to the subway</i>

26:41.077 --> 26:43.409
<i>with my groceries, a bag of cat litter,</i>

26:43.480 --> 26:48.042
<i>a bottle of olive oil I absolutely could not</i>
<i>live without, and a huge bunch of branches</i>

26:48.118 --> 26:51.747
<i>was that the branches were</i>
<i>probably not a good idea.</i>

26:52.189 --> 26:53.213
Sorry.

26:53.290 --> 26:56.282
<i>They were slapping folks in the face</i>
<i>right and left and I was sweating like a pig.</i>

26:56.359 --> 27:01.695
<i>Not surprising, since I've been way too busy</i>
<i>cooking fattening food to bother exercising.</i>

27:02.098 --> 27:06.330
<i>And then I came home and got</i>
<i>a big vote of confidence from my mother.</i>

27:06.636 --> 27:09.503
<i>Remind me again why you're doing this...</i>

27:09.773 --> 27:12.298
- Blog.
<i>- Whatever it's called.</i>

27:13.210 --> 27:16.441
It's a regimen, Mom. Like doing sit-ups.

27:16.546 --> 27:19.879
<i>- Well, it's just adding pressure.</i>
- What pressure?

27:19.950 --> 27:22.942
<i>You have a full-time job,</i>
<i>you have a husband,</i>

27:23.019 --> 27:25.920
<i>and now you're gonna get sick</i>
<i>from blogging.</i>

27:25.989 --> 27:29.356
- It's sort of like being in AA.
<i>- What are you saying?</i>

27:30.293 --> 27:33.353
It gives you something you have to do
every day, one day at a time.

27:33.430 --> 27:35.364
<i>How do you know this lingo?</i>

27:35.432 --> 27:37.491
<i>Honey, are you an alcoholic?</i>

27:37.567 --> 27:40.559
I'm saying it's good for me to have
short-term goals.

27:40.637 --> 27:43.731
<i>Well, that is silly. That is just plain silly.</i>

27:44.207 --> 27:46.107
<i>Who's reading this blog?</i>

27:46.176 --> 27:48.235
People. People are reading it, I'm sure.

27:48.311 --> 27:50.108
<i>Well, it's something you decided to do,</i>

27:50.180 --> 27:53.411
<i>and you can decide not to,</i>
<i>and not one single person's gonna mind.</i>

27:53.483 --> 27:56.043
No. Don't you get it? I just started.

27:56.119 --> 27:59.316
I can't stop, I have to finish. It's all I've got.

28:00.357 --> 28:02.587
Hello? Hello?

28:04.227 --> 28:05.421
Stupid dead phone.

28:05.495 --> 28:07.520
Hey, it's not all you got.

28:08.365 --> 28:10.856
I know. I know. I didn't mean that.

28:13.303 --> 28:15.635
<i>Yesterday, I poached an egg.</i>

28:15.906 --> 28:17.498
<i>It seemed like the perfect thing to do</i>

28:17.574 --> 28:21.135
<i>on perhaps the second worst workday</i>
<i>in recorded history.</i>

28:21.211 --> 28:23.543
Explain to me how you've never eaten
an egg in your whole life.

28:23.613 --> 28:25.843
I've had eggs in, like, cakes.

28:26.583 --> 28:29.609
Never had an "egg" egg.
I was a very willful child.

28:29.686 --> 28:30.914
It's simmering.

28:30.987 --> 28:35.219
<i>I had this notion, God knows why,</i>
<i>that poaching eggs would be simple.</i>

28:36.293 --> 28:37.590
<i>But I was deeply wrong.</i>

28:37.661 --> 28:40.528
"Immediately and gently push the white over
the yolk with a wooden spoon

28:40.597 --> 28:43.327
"for two to three seconds." Immediately.

28:49.306 --> 28:50.603
Disgusting.

28:50.674 --> 28:53.438
Oh, maybe the eggs aren't fresh.
Julia says the eggs have to be fresh.

28:53.510 --> 28:55.034
They are fresh.

28:55.578 --> 28:59.605
Okay. You don't have to bite my head off.
I'm just quoting Julia.

29:00.050 --> 29:03.417
<i>It took three of us, crammed into the</i>
<i>kitchen over a pot of simmering water,</i>

29:03.486 --> 29:05.818
<i>but, eventually, we nailed it.</i>

29:05.889 --> 29:07.618
- Hello.
- Welcome.

29:07.824 --> 29:09.018
How cute is that?

29:09.960 --> 29:15.159
<i>And I ate my very first egg</i>
<i>of my whole life, ever, ever, ever.</i>

29:16.766 --> 29:21.100
I thought eggs were going to be greasy
and slimy, but it tastes like

29:22.339 --> 29:24.739
cheese sauce. Yum.

29:25.842 --> 29:27.605
Julia Child, you are so good.

29:27.677 --> 29:29.076
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:29.145 --> 29:31.670
And, may I say, excellent wine?

29:31.881 --> 29:35.044
- Do you think Julia knows about you?
- I wish.

29:35.352 --> 29:39.220
I have this fantasy that she comes for dinner
and I show her my new lemon zester.

29:39.289 --> 29:41.086
We become very close.

29:42.792 --> 29:45.317
The truth is, no one knows about me.

29:45.929 --> 29:49.490
I feel like I'm just sending things
into this giant void.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.527
Which reminds me. Annabelle's blog.
Have you read it lately?

29:53.603 --> 29:54.661
Yes.

29:55.238 --> 29:57.968
- It's sort of funny.
- Is it?

29:58.608 --> 30:02.339
She's dating this rich guy who owns a plane.
His name's Lester.

30:02.412 --> 30:07.941
And they do it in the air.
People love it. It's a huge hit.

30:09.152 --> 30:12.087
What do you think it means
if you don't like your friends?

30:12.155 --> 30:14.646
- It's completely normal.
- Men like their friends.

30:14.724 --> 30:18.091
We're not talking about men.
Who's talking about men?

30:19.129 --> 30:23.828
<i>So it's five weeks down, 47 to go,</i>
<i>and I feel fantastic.</i>

30:24.234 --> 30:29.001
<i>Sometimes, I can't help but wonder.</i>
<i>Is there anyone out there reading me?</i>

30:29.072 --> 30:32.235
<i>But I'm sure you are,</i>
<i>aren't you? Somebody?</i>

30:33.376 --> 30:34.570
<i>Anybody?</i>

30:36.179 --> 30:38.306
Ernestine, I have a comment.

30:45.255 --> 30:47.416
My mother. Doesn't count.

30:52.328 --> 30:56.492
Today we will begin by learning to boil eggs.

30:57.500 --> 31:02.597
First, you must make sure
that the egg is fresh.

31:03.173 --> 31:05.801
I was so hoping that...

31:06.776 --> 31:10.837
Well, for something a little more advanced,
Madame Brassart.

31:11.214 --> 31:14.547
But you are not an advanced cook.

31:14.717 --> 31:17.777
But I do know how to boil an egg.

31:18.688 --> 31:21.213
Do you know how to bone a duck?

31:21.391 --> 31:25.020
No, but that's exactly the sort of thing

31:25.095 --> 31:28.758
that I'm very interested
in learning how to do.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.633
There is one other class,
but you will not like it.

31:35.772 --> 31:40.471
It's for <i>professionnel,</i>
which you will never be, I'm sure.

31:40.910 --> 31:43.936
All men. All GIs.

31:44.848 --> 31:46.475
And very expensive.

31:46.549 --> 31:50.349
I cannot imagine
that you would ever want to pay the tuition.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.182
How much?

31:53.823 --> 31:56.053
So the onion is ready, but...

32:19.682 --> 32:21.877
You must hold the knife,
first of all, like this.

32:21.951 --> 32:24.351
Wrist, easy. Leave the thumb here.

32:25.121 --> 32:27.817
The hand and the knife are one.

32:27.891 --> 32:31.088
And the hand, the other hand,
you must protect it.

32:31.294 --> 32:34.024
Here, you must cut only the onion. Yes?

32:34.097 --> 32:36.258
- Not me.
- Yes.

32:36.332 --> 32:40.029
And then, you put your thumb here
and the other fingers here.

32:51.447 --> 32:52.607
Jule?

32:53.416 --> 32:55.714
You're being a little over-competitive,
don't you think?

32:55.785 --> 32:59.084
Well, you should've seen the way
those men looked at me.

32:59.189 --> 33:05.025
As if I were some frivolous housewife,
just looking for a way to kill time.

33:06.963 --> 33:08.191
Well...

33:11.801 --> 33:13.860
- Where are you going?
- Not here.

33:13.937 --> 33:16.167
- You hungry?
- No.

33:18.107 --> 33:19.301
Good.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.240
Ta-da!

33:47.604 --> 33:49.799
Well done, Madame Child.

33:52.875 --> 33:58.040
<i>Dear Avis,</i>
<i>I'm in my third week at Le Cordon Bleu,</i>

33:58.214 --> 34:00.341
<i>and I'm in utter bliss.</i>

34:00.850 --> 34:05.116
<i>Every morning the alarm goes off at 6:30,</i>
<i>and I leap out of bed.</i>

34:05.188 --> 34:06.416
I'm up!

34:06.489 --> 34:12.257
<i>By 7:30 I'm in class, in my apron,</i>
<i>peeling potatoes.</i>

34:12.527 --> 34:16.464
<i>Then we cook stock and we bone fish.</i>

34:16.532 --> 34:21.435
<i>We dress pigeons.</i>
<i>We make pastry with so much butter,</i>

34:21.504 --> 34:24.871
<i>it almost stops your heart just to look at it.</i>

34:25.141 --> 34:29.339
<i>My teacher moves so quickly</i>
<i>I'm sometimes lost.</i>

34:29.411 --> 34:33.313
<i>But I'm way ahead of the others in the class,</i>
<i>all of them men,</i>

34:33.382 --> 34:39.447
<i>and all of them very unfriendly,</i>
<i>until they discovered I was fearless.</i>

34:39.889 --> 34:43.085
<i>Something I realized</i>
<i>about the same time they did.</i>

34:43.826 --> 34:49.924
<i>Morning class ends at 12:30,</i>
<i>then I go home and make lunch for Paul.</i>

34:53.770 --> 34:56.637
<i>Then Paul takes a nap.</i>

34:58.941 --> 35:03.810
<i>And later in the afternoon, he goes back</i>
<i>to the embassy and I go back to school.</i>

35:05.715 --> 35:09.310
You must have a mortar and pestle.

35:09.485 --> 35:14.354
<i>Incidentally, my father is horrified</i>
<i>I'm going to cooking school.</i>

35:14.424 --> 35:17.450
<i>Offered to give me extra money</i>
<i>to hire a cook.</i>

35:18.828 --> 35:23.424
Go on. Fun! Joy! This is what matters.

35:23.499 --> 35:26.059
<i>I'm probably the only American I know</i>
<i>in Paris</i>

35:26.135 --> 35:31.266
<i>who thinks shopping for food</i>
<i>is as much fun as buying a dress.</i>

35:31.674 --> 35:33.608
<i>Course, you'd think so too,</i>
<i>if you lived in a country</i>

35:33.676 --> 35:37.942
<i>where absolutely nothing comes in my size.</i>

35:38.715 --> 35:42.708
<i>By the way, did you know</i>
<i>that if you don't dry meat,</i>

35:42.819 --> 35:45.219
<i>it won't brown properly?</i>

35:45.688 --> 35:51.490
<i>Irma Rombauer doesn't say a word about it</i>
<i>in the</i> Joy of Cooking.

35:52.261 --> 35:55.856
<i>Avis, I am in heaven here.</i>

35:56.032 --> 35:59.195
<i>I've been looking for a career all my life...</i>

35:59.535 --> 36:02.766
- Happy Valentine's Day.
<i>...and I've found it.</i>

36:04.474 --> 36:06.999
We met in Ceylon when we were in the OSS.

36:07.076 --> 36:09.510
But he never noticed me at first.

36:09.579 --> 36:12.377
Well, that's not true. I noticed you.
I noticed your legs straightaway.

36:12.448 --> 36:14.609
Oh, you were such a roué.

36:14.951 --> 36:19.081
- All the women were mad for him.
- Can you blame them?

36:19.155 --> 36:21.680
Anyway, we were sent off to China.

36:22.058 --> 36:25.960
Absolutely delicious, if I do say so myself.

36:26.129 --> 36:27.357
Julia.

36:27.430 --> 36:29.796
When you finish your term,
you'll be teaching at Cordon Bleu.

36:29.866 --> 36:31.697
No, I don't think so.

36:31.868 --> 36:35.463
The woman who runs it absolutely hates me!

36:35.538 --> 36:38.473
Come on.
Oh, no one could possibly hate you.

36:39.175 --> 36:40.972
That's true. But she does.

36:41.043 --> 36:42.601
Were you spies?

36:44.514 --> 36:47.381
No. Yes. No.

36:48.818 --> 36:50.376
Oh, so cagey, right?

36:51.921 --> 36:56.119
You were in the Office of Strategic Services
and you were not spies?

36:56.325 --> 36:58.759
I was only a file clerk.

36:59.662 --> 37:04.690
But Paul? Paul designed all of the secret
war rooms for General Mountbatten.

37:05.034 --> 37:07.264
Well, just maps and exhibits and things.
It wasn't...

37:07.336 --> 37:10.737
He did!
He single-handedly won the war for us.

37:10.807 --> 37:14.868
Well, I had to. Someone did.
I mean, it was dragging on, wasn't it?

37:15.111 --> 37:19.343
Anyway, so there we were in China,
just friends having dinner,

37:23.486 --> 37:25.750
and it turned out to be Julia.

37:27.223 --> 37:29.714
It turned out to be Julia all along.

37:34.297 --> 37:38.290
Julia, you are the butter to my bread,
and the breath to my life.

37:38.768 --> 37:40.759
I love you, darling girl.

37:41.938 --> 37:43.803
Happy Valentine's Day.

37:50.046 --> 37:51.604
<i>Dear Charlie,</i>

37:51.681 --> 37:55.208
<i>Julia in front of her stove</i>
<i>has the same fascination for me</i>

37:55.284 --> 37:58.219
<i>as watching a kettle drummer</i>
<i>at the symphony.</i>

37:58.788 --> 38:01.723
<i>The oven door opens and shuts so fast,</i>

38:01.791 --> 38:06.660
<i>you hardly notice the deft thrust of a spoon</i>
<i>as she dips into a casserole,</i>

38:06.729 --> 38:08.720
<i>and up to her mouth for a taste check</i>

38:08.798 --> 38:11.995
<i>like a perfectly-timed double beat</i>
<i>on the drums.</i>

38:12.134 --> 38:14.329
<i>Then with her bare fingers,</i>

38:14.403 --> 38:18.703
<i>she snatches a set of cannelloni</i>
<i>out of the pot of boiling water,</i>

38:18.774 --> 38:20.036
<i>and she cries,</i>

38:20.109 --> 38:23.169
<i>" These damn things</i>
<i>are as hot as a stiff cock. "</i>

38:24.747 --> 38:26.214
- She said what?
- I know.

38:26.282 --> 38:29.877
- Julia Child said, "Hot as a..."
- I know, I'm shocked.

38:30.419 --> 38:35.686
It's from a letter that Paul Child
wrote to his twin brother Charlie in 1949,

38:35.758 --> 38:38.022
when Julia was just starting classes
at Le Cordon Bleu.

38:38.094 --> 38:41.222
So Julia and Paul, <i>beaucoup, beaucoup.</i>

38:41.297 --> 38:44.494
- I know. Just goes to show you.
- What?

38:44.567 --> 38:47.593
You can never tell about
a person's sex life by looking at them.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.467
They were so in love.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.777
Hot sauce from a reader.

38:55.878 --> 39:00.338
And today I had 12 comments from readers,
and I didn't know any of them.

39:01.751 --> 39:04.652
<i>Thanks to all my faithful readers</i>
<i>for this loot.</i>

39:04.754 --> 39:08.451
<i>I have now completed 65 recipes in 47 days.</i>

39:14.797 --> 39:18.528
<i>On track with 103 recipes</i>
<i>in just over two months.</i>

39:18.601 --> 39:19.625
Looks like a cupcake.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.966
<i>Lobster thermidor is coming up,</i>

39:22.038 --> 39:26.372
<i>and I am going to have to murder</i>
<i>and dismember a crustacean.</i>

39:26.776 --> 39:28.744
<i>How will I ever do this?</i>

39:29.178 --> 39:31.840
<i>Last night our sleep machine,</i>
<i>the one we have by our bed</i>

39:31.914 --> 39:35.179
<i>to drown out the noise of freight trucks</i>
<i>rumbling past our apartment,</i>

39:35.251 --> 39:37.981
<i>was speaking to me. And it was saying,</i>

39:38.054 --> 39:39.646
"Lobster killer.

39:40.456 --> 39:43.448
"Lobster killer, lobster killer, lobster killer."

39:45.494 --> 39:48.361
One of my readers said
that if you put lobsters in the freezer,

39:48.431 --> 39:50.296
it sort of numbs them.

39:56.839 --> 40:00.036
Then I got another comment that said,
"Man up, kill the damn lobster.

40:00.109 --> 40:02.339
"Just take a knife and do it."

40:07.717 --> 40:09.241
It's alive!

40:09.318 --> 40:10.512
Eric.

40:15.858 --> 40:17.189
Oh, God.

40:18.861 --> 40:21.295
"A note on dealing with live lobsters.

40:21.364 --> 40:25.130
"If you object to steaming
a live lobster," yes,

40:25.201 --> 40:29.160
"plunge the point of the knife
into the head between the eyes."

40:30.473 --> 40:33.499
Oh, Julia, you make it sound so simple.

40:33.576 --> 40:35.168
Lobster killer.

40:35.511 --> 40:36.705
Eric.

40:38.014 --> 40:39.311
Eric.

40:39.382 --> 40:41.145
Get out of here.

40:41.484 --> 40:44.544
I don't need you at all.
You are completely useless.

40:44.620 --> 40:48.920
I'm just gonna throw them into the water

40:48.991 --> 40:52.290
and put the lid on and that will be that.

40:52.361 --> 40:53.419
Fine.

40:53.496 --> 40:54.588
Fine.

40:58.234 --> 40:59.428
Hello.

41:00.302 --> 41:01.530
Goodbye.

41:04.140 --> 41:05.505
I'm sorry.

41:10.212 --> 41:11.611
I'm sorry.

41:28.731 --> 41:30.028
You okay?

41:32.068 --> 41:33.330
Okay.

41:35.738 --> 41:37.365
Okay. All right.

41:38.874 --> 41:40.466
All right, boys.

41:41.010 --> 41:43.308
There's a new sheriff in town.

41:45.948 --> 41:47.506
Lobster killer.

41:49.085 --> 41:50.916
Lobster killer.

41:57.093 --> 41:58.651
Under control.

41:59.061 --> 42:00.653
You are a saint.

42:01.630 --> 42:04.690
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

42:04.767 --> 42:06.860
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:10.606 --> 42:11.834
- I can't. I can't.
- You can.

42:11.907 --> 42:14.034
- No, I can't. I have a lot to do.
- You can.

42:14.110 --> 42:15.236
- Eric, I can't.
- I'm good.

42:15.311 --> 42:16.403
- Eric.
- Just give me one more, give me one more.

42:16.479 --> 42:20.074
- Just one more.
- Fine. Go, I have so much to do. Get!

42:20.149 --> 42:21.377
Out!

42:25.354 --> 42:27.345
- Hey, thank you so much.
- Hey, man. How you doing?

42:27.423 --> 42:28.481
Happy birthday.

42:28.557 --> 42:29.751
Yeah, terrific. Good to see you.

42:29.825 --> 42:32.225
- Cake.
- Cake. Brother-in-law.

42:32.294 --> 42:33.989
- Love you so much.
- Hey, man.

42:34.063 --> 42:35.553
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

42:35.631 --> 42:37.155
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

42:37.233 --> 42:38.791
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

42:40.402 --> 42:41.767
Happy birthday, Julie.

42:41.837 --> 42:43.896
- Happy birthday.
- Hi! Thanks, sweetheart.

42:43.973 --> 42:46.999
Oh, thanks for coming all out here. Hey, you.

42:48.244 --> 42:51.372
Here's an incredible thing.
When Julia and Paul met, she was a virgin.

42:51.447 --> 42:52.812
- Really?
- Wow.

42:52.882 --> 42:55.282
She was, like, practically 40.

42:55.351 --> 42:57.444
- You serious?
- How does anyone even know that?

42:57.520 --> 43:00.614
There were all these letters that Julia
wrote to her friend Avis De Voto.

43:00.723 --> 43:04.454
And Paul wrote to his brother, and no
one threw anything out, as far as I can tell.

43:04.493 --> 43:07.553
When they got married,
she could barely boil an egg.

43:07.630 --> 43:08.824
Isn't that amazing?

43:08.898 --> 43:10.092
Really?

43:11.100 --> 43:14.592
- Braised cucumbers are a revelation.
- This is good.

43:14.670 --> 43:17.264
I'm obsessed with her. I'm totally obsessed.

43:17.339 --> 43:18.601
She's totally obsessed.

43:18.674 --> 43:20.972
Well, it's good that you are,
because this is amazing.

43:21.043 --> 43:22.601
Seriously. So good.

43:22.678 --> 43:26.375
Well, savor it, because that's all there is.
I mean, lobster, major bucks.

43:26.448 --> 43:29.474
Why don't you put a PayPal thing
on the website?

43:29.552 --> 43:31.417
People could send in money
if they felt like it.

43:31.487 --> 43:33.421
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

43:33.489 --> 43:35.423
You have fans, your readers love you.

43:35.491 --> 43:38.255
I do? I have fans?

43:38.327 --> 43:40.056
Yeah, you do.

43:41.363 --> 43:44.127
- Well, I can't ask them for money.
- Why not?

43:44.200 --> 43:49.035
I think you should do the PayPal thing.
That way we could have more lobster.

43:49.104 --> 43:54.235
- Harder. Get them. Get them. Hey, hey, hey!
- Thirty. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty.

43:57.513 --> 43:59.606
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

44:01.917 --> 44:03.282
Thank you.

44:16.599 --> 44:18.328
Just like Julia's.

44:21.203 --> 44:23.831
Only hers were probably the real deal.

44:24.607 --> 44:26.370
They're beautiful.

44:26.442 --> 44:28.205
Help you put it on.

44:31.847 --> 44:34.111
Let's give this a shot here.

44:38.854 --> 44:40.321
How's that?

44:41.590 --> 44:42.750
Yeah.

44:43.626 --> 44:45.253
I'm 30.

44:46.228 --> 44:48.856
I thought it was gonna be terrible,

44:49.565 --> 44:53.592
but thanks to you, and thanks to Julia,

44:53.669 --> 44:56.229
it feels like I'm gonna get through.

44:58.574 --> 44:59.768
Cake.

45:00.910 --> 45:02.969
More cake. How do you like that cake?

45:10.052 --> 45:11.417
Hey, you.

45:13.889 --> 45:15.516
I'm going to bed.

45:22.898 --> 45:25.594
Ernie, 53 comments on my lobster blog.

45:25.668 --> 45:26.930
Shut up.

45:29.738 --> 45:31.569
- Julie Powell.
<i>- This the person I speak to</i>

45:31.640 --> 45:32.698
<i>if I got a problem?</i>

45:32.775 --> 45:34.003
Yes, sir. What is your problem?

45:34.076 --> 45:36.636
<i>Too much food, not enough sex.</i>

45:37.947 --> 45:39.244
Eric, that's not funny.

45:39.315 --> 45:41.647
<i>I thought it was pretty funny.</i>

45:42.117 --> 45:43.175
Okay, it was.

45:43.252 --> 45:44.879
<i>- Hey, guess what?</i>
- What?

45:44.954 --> 45:48.822
You are the third most
popular blog on salon. com.

45:49.358 --> 45:51.588
- I am?
<i>- Yes, you are.</i>

45:51.660 --> 45:52.820
I am!

45:53.295 --> 45:56.355
So I figure for every one who writes in,

45:56.432 --> 46:00.425
there are, I don't know, hundreds that don't.
Don't you think?

46:00.636 --> 46:05.369
It's like there's this whole group of people
who are sort of connected to me.

46:06.475 --> 46:08.534
They need me in some way.

46:09.111 --> 46:12.979
Like, if I didn't write,
they would really be upset.

46:13.816 --> 46:18.344
They'd probably take, like, poison,
try to kill themselves.

46:48.017 --> 46:49.279
Julia.

46:50.319 --> 46:51.718
Are you still making hats?

46:51.787 --> 46:54.347
Oh, no, I abandoned it.

46:54.423 --> 46:58.883
But I am ready to graduate
from the Cordon Bleu.

46:59.428 --> 47:03.660
I can't get the damn woman
who runs the school to schedule the test.

47:04.033 --> 47:07.525
Madame Brassart?
Is that the woman you are speaking of?

47:07.770 --> 47:09.499
She is a bitch.

47:10.773 --> 47:12.570
She is, you're right.

47:12.975 --> 47:18.106
I think she's almost the only person
in the world I honestly can't stand.

47:20.049 --> 47:22.950
She is not the only person I can't stand.

47:23.786 --> 47:25.219
Do you two know each other?

47:25.287 --> 47:28.120
You should. Julia Child, Simone Beck.

47:28.524 --> 47:30.958
- Simca.
- Simca, how do you do?

47:31.760 --> 47:34.729
And this is my friend Louisette Bertholle.

47:36.899 --> 47:39.163
I can't believe you haven't met.

47:39.234 --> 47:42.169
Simca and Louisette are writing a cookbook.

47:42.971 --> 47:45.531
- For Americans.
- Really?

47:46.175 --> 47:48.837
Why do you need to take a stupid test?

47:49.645 --> 47:52.671
So I can get a diploma. So I can teach.

47:53.382 --> 47:55.873
You don't need a diploma to teach.

47:56.518 --> 47:57.951
You're probably right.

47:58.020 --> 48:00.818
- Avis says the same thing.
- Who is Avis?

48:00.923 --> 48:04.916
My friend, Avis De Voto,
who lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

48:05.227 --> 48:06.990
She's very wise.

48:07.162 --> 48:11.462
But I can't help it. I want a diploma.

48:12.568 --> 48:15.230
I am very conventional.

48:18.807 --> 48:20.900
I don't know what to do.

48:21.677 --> 48:26.671
Well, why don't you write
to the horrible Madame Brassart

48:26.748 --> 48:28.079
and threaten her?

48:28.150 --> 48:29.742
Threaten her? With what?

48:29.818 --> 48:32.082
The United States of America.

48:32.154 --> 48:33.382
Yes!

48:33.455 --> 48:36.447
Tell her the American ambassador
personally wants you

48:36.525 --> 48:38.459
to take the examination.

48:38.527 --> 48:40.586
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48:40.696 --> 48:43.187
I couldn't do that. Heavens, no!

48:43.265 --> 48:46.996
The American ambassador.
Hardly even know the man.

48:47.669 --> 48:49.068
Of course you can.

48:49.138 --> 48:51.197
<i>Dear Madame Brassart,</i>

48:51.673 --> 48:54.301
<i>everyone at the American embassy,</i>

48:54.376 --> 48:57.971
<i>including my dear friend the ambassador,</i>

48:58.046 --> 49:03.712
<i>will be very surprised if I'm not allowed</i>
<i>to take my examination.</i>

49:03.785 --> 49:05.980
You will write the recipes

49:06.555 --> 49:09.649
for <i>oeufs mollets.</i>
<i>Côtelettes de veau en surprise,</i>

49:09.725 --> 49:12.159
<i>et crème renversée au caramel.</i>

49:13.695 --> 49:18.359
<i>Côtelettes de veau en surprise.</i>

49:19.968 --> 49:24.667
I had no idea
what veal <i>en surprise</i> was. None.

49:24.740 --> 49:30.110
Cooked it in class.
It's a veal chop with mushrooms in a bag.

49:30.179 --> 49:33.342
A paper bag. That's the surprise.

49:33.415 --> 49:35.713
You open the bag, surprise!

49:36.885 --> 49:42.346
Veal and mushrooms, it's just
I've never flunked a test in my entire life.

49:42.424 --> 49:47.361
- I am an A student.
- You can ask to take it again.

49:51.700 --> 49:54.032
- I can?
- Of course.

49:54.102 --> 49:57.162
Meanwhile, you can come teach with us.

49:59.641 --> 50:00.733
Gosh!

50:01.210 --> 50:04.873
Is it true you plan to teach?

50:04.947 --> 50:08.508
Yes, we're going to teach
Americans in Paris how to cook.

50:09.117 --> 50:15.056
Madame Child, I must tell you,
you have no real talent for cooking.

50:16.058 --> 50:20.495
But the Americans
will never know the difference.

50:31.306 --> 50:35.333
<i>We are, I am sorry to say, entering aspics.</i>

50:36.111 --> 50:39.979
<i>An aspic is sort of a beef-flavored</i>
<i>Jell-O mold.</i>

50:40.048 --> 50:41.709
<i>Doesn't that sound delicious?</i>

50:42.284 --> 50:44.809
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>why no one makes them anymore.</i>

50:44.886 --> 50:46.410
<i>You begin with a calf's foot,</i>

50:46.488 --> 50:49.651
<i>which I am in possession of</i>
<i>thanks to my sainted husband,</i>

50:49.725 --> 50:53.661
<i>and you boil it until</i>
<i>your kitchen smells like a tannery.</i>

50:54.463 --> 50:58.490
<i>And then it gels in the refrigerator</i>
<i>and you flip it onto a plate.</i>

50:58.834 --> 51:01.826
<i>Which, according to Julia Child,</i>
<i>is supposed to be easy.</i>

51:01.903 --> 51:06.169
<i>And all I can say about that,</i>
<i>no offense intended, Julia, is</i>

51:06.942 --> 51:08.170
<i>the bitch lied.</i>

51:09.478 --> 51:10.911
Shit.

51:14.349 --> 51:16.977
- Shit!
- How many more aspics are there?

51:17.519 --> 51:18.679
Seven.

51:19.721 --> 51:21.655
No one will know if you don't do them.

51:21.723 --> 51:24.851
It's not like there's, like,
the Aspic Police or something.

51:24.926 --> 51:26.416
You could lie.

51:26.495 --> 51:28.759
I can't. I just can't.

51:28.830 --> 51:32.857
Julia will know. It's like she's watching me.
I'm under her influence.

51:32.934 --> 51:36.097
I'm becoming a much better person
because of her.

51:36.471 --> 51:39.167
Yuck! The sink! Look at this!

51:42.577 --> 51:45.512
I hate it here!
Did you put something down the sink?

51:45.580 --> 51:46.569
You hate it here?

51:46.648 --> 51:49.913
How am I supposed to cook anything
in this kitchen?

51:49.985 --> 51:54.285
It's no wonder that my mold fell apart.
I don't suppose we have any Drano.

51:54.356 --> 51:56.347
Not unless you bought it.

51:56.992 --> 51:59.586
I do all of this
and I'm supposed to buy Drano, too?

51:59.695 --> 52:03.495
Right now, you are so
not under the influence of Julia Child.

52:06.902 --> 52:11.771
What if I don't make my deadline, Eric?
I'll have wasted a whole year of my life.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.037
I used to be thin and now I'm getting fat.

52:15.110 --> 52:16.338
- Fat?
- On top of which,

52:16.411 --> 52:17.935
I have to bone a whole duck.

52:18.013 --> 52:20.072
- When?
- At some point.

52:20.148 --> 52:23.345
- Can you even conceive of boning a duck?
- No, I can't.

52:23.418 --> 52:25.215
Of course you can't.

52:28.523 --> 52:31.720
<i>I'm sure you all remember,</i>
<i>because it was only a few days ago,</i>

52:31.793 --> 52:34.193
<i>that I had a meltdown over my aspic</i>

52:34.262 --> 52:37.925
<i>and vowed to transform myself</i>
<i>into a better human being.</i>

52:39.267 --> 52:42.998
<i>And then I was trussing</i>
<i>the</i> poulet rôti à la normande,

52:43.071 --> 52:46.700
<i>which is roast chicken stuffed with</i>
<i>chicken livers and cream cheese,</i>

52:46.775 --> 52:51.235
<i>and it fell on the floor and the stuffing</i>
<i>fell out into a big gooey mess.</i>

52:52.447 --> 52:55.416
<i>So, long story short, another meltdown.</i>

52:55.484 --> 52:56.974
This is crazy.

52:57.352 --> 52:58.785
<i>Worse than the last.</i>

53:01.189 --> 53:03.384
I can't even truss.

53:04.025 --> 53:07.961
<i>And I cried like a small,</i>
<i>emotionally disturbed child.</i>

53:08.830 --> 53:10.354
I'm a mess.

53:16.605 --> 53:18.596
I got it. I got it.

53:19.741 --> 53:20.799
Hello?

53:22.811 --> 53:24.278
Yeah, who's this?

53:27.115 --> 53:28.514
Can you hold on just one second?

53:28.583 --> 53:32.417
I'm not sure if she's here.
She might've stepped out. Hold on.

53:38.160 --> 53:42.187
Hey, it's a reporter from
<i>The Christian Science Monitor.</i>

53:42.264 --> 53:44.357
He wants to write about you.

53:47.068 --> 53:48.365
He does?

53:48.437 --> 53:51.531
I should tell him to call back, right?

53:51.606 --> 53:53.801
No, no, I'll take it.

53:58.780 --> 53:59.940
Hello?

54:01.650 --> 54:02.674
Yes?

54:03.852 --> 54:06.184
You want to bring who to dinner?

54:07.823 --> 54:11.190
No, of course, I know who that is.
I know exactly who that is.

54:11.259 --> 54:12.920
Who? Who, who, who, who?

54:14.529 --> 54:17.396
That would be great,
that would be completely amazing.

54:17.466 --> 54:18.728
Goodbye.

54:19.468 --> 54:22.596
- Who?
- Guess who's coming to dinner?

54:23.305 --> 54:24.704
Oh, my God.

54:26.541 --> 54:28.600
To <i>Les Trois Gourmandes.</i>

54:29.311 --> 54:31.108
One for all and all for one.

54:32.247 --> 54:33.305
Yes!

54:34.316 --> 54:37.444
All right. I had such a horrible time

54:37.519 --> 54:41.922
converting these recipes
from the metric system.

54:41.990 --> 54:45.824
- Measurements do not matter.
- Oh, but they do!

54:46.795 --> 54:49.263
They absolutely do.

54:49.331 --> 54:50.764
This is one of the biggest arguments

54:50.832 --> 54:53.232
Louisette and I had
when we worked on our cookbook.

54:53.301 --> 54:55.326
Which is finally finished.

54:55.403 --> 54:59.737
Sent off to the publisher.
Soon Simca and I will be famous.

54:59.841 --> 55:02.605
We'll be the next Mrs. <i>Joy of Cooking.</i>

55:03.879 --> 55:07.679
Maybe. All right. Well, let's try.
Let's just give it a...

55:08.984 --> 55:10.349
Can I help?

55:15.657 --> 55:17.625
Yeah. It is <i>mieux.</i>

55:20.128 --> 55:24.895
So, yes. They're early. Americans!

55:25.267 --> 55:30.864
<i>Dear Dorothy,</i>
<i>your sister, Julia, is now a cooking teacher.</i>

55:30.939 --> 55:35.205
<i>We have three students who pay $2 a class.</i>

55:35.277 --> 55:38.872
<i>Barely enough to cover the cost of the food,</i>
<i>but who cares?</i>

55:38.947 --> 55:43.907
<i>Simca, Louisette, and I
<i>are</i> Les Trois Gourmandes.</i>

55:44.085 --> 55:47.486
<i>Although sometimes we are only</i>
Les Deux Gourmandes

55:47.556 --> 55:51.048
<i>because Louisette</i>
<i>turns out to have headaches</i>

55:51.126 --> 55:55.688
<i>and doctor's appointments</i>
<i>she schedules during class.</i>

55:55.764 --> 55:57.789
I have a little headache.

55:59.434 --> 56:02.699
<i>You'll meet them both</i>
<i>when you come here next month,</i>

56:02.771 --> 56:06.502
<i>unless, of course,</i>
<i>Louisette is having a stomachache.</i>

56:06.575 --> 56:12.104
Perfection.
And even if it isn't, never apologize.

56:12.180 --> 56:15.445
No excuses! No explanations.

56:16.318 --> 56:19.412
Louisette abandoned us,
another stomachache.

56:19.487 --> 56:21.011
And the day before that,

56:21.089 --> 56:25.651
she left class before we even finished
making the chocolate Bavarian cream.

56:26.027 --> 56:30.760
I can't believe that's the only time
her dentist could see her.

56:30.832 --> 56:33.232
Keep an eye out,
we don't want to miss Dorothy.

56:33.301 --> 56:35.667
It's impossible to miss your sister.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.231
I don't see her!

56:43.745 --> 56:46.612
- There she is.
- Dorothy!

56:51.686 --> 56:54.780
Hi, Julia! I missed you!

56:54.856 --> 56:56.187
So good to see...

56:56.257 --> 56:58.191
- Paul!
- Hi. Hi, sweetie.

56:58.259 --> 57:01.990
I've had an adventure on the ocean liner!

57:02.063 --> 57:05.191
- I didn't get sick once!
- Good girl! How about your legs?

57:05.266 --> 57:08.463
People were dropping like flies
all around me!

57:11.006 --> 57:13.804
- Look.
- Oh, my goodness.

57:13.875 --> 57:15.536
Look at that.

57:17.379 --> 57:23.682
All I think about all day is food
and then I dream about it all night.

57:24.653 --> 57:26.450
It is true, she's obsessed.

57:26.521 --> 57:29.183
If I didn't sit in the kitchen, I'd never see her.

57:29.290 --> 57:34.250
Last week, I dreamed that
I made <i>cassoulet</i> for Dad,

57:34.796 --> 57:37.230
and he hated it, of course.

57:37.298 --> 57:39.766
He doesn't understand any of this.

57:39.834 --> 57:41.665
I almost feel sorry for him.

57:41.736 --> 57:44.830
He wanted so much
for us to stay in Pasadena,

57:44.906 --> 57:47.739
marry Republicans, and breed like rabbits.

57:48.176 --> 57:50.804
- Why didn't we?
- Too tall.

57:50.879 --> 57:52.608
Let's face it, it's true.

57:52.681 --> 57:55.411
From the beginning,
you just don't fit in. Literally.

57:55.517 --> 57:58.315
- So then you don't.
- I know, it's true.

57:58.386 --> 58:01.412
Do not bait Father about politics
when he comes.

58:01.489 --> 58:03.957
- No.
- Or he won't pick up the check.

58:04.025 --> 58:07.051
- He won't, will he?
- I can't make any promises.

58:07.128 --> 58:10.120
- He loves Senator McCarthy.
- Oh, I know.

58:10.198 --> 58:11.358
- Pasadena.
- Pasadena.

58:11.433 --> 58:12.491
Jinx.

58:20.308 --> 58:22.367
Dort, do you have... You have the Brie.

58:22.444 --> 58:24.071
- Is this the Brie?
- Yes. Yes, that's the Brie.

58:24.145 --> 58:27.171
Is that not the most wonderful cheese
you ever had in your life?

58:27.248 --> 58:29.079
- Yes!
- Yes.

58:29.150 --> 58:30.811
The answer's yes.

58:35.090 --> 58:40.357
I got the chef at Chez la Mère Michel
to give me the recipe for <i>beurre blanc.</i>

58:40.428 --> 58:42.760
<i>Beurre blanc.</i> What's <i>beurre blanc?</i>

58:42.831 --> 58:46.494
- Butter in a white wine vinegar reduction.
- I love butter.

58:47.335 --> 58:49.530
You whisk them together,

58:49.604 --> 58:54.268
and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids in the butter

58:54.342 --> 58:57.505
so that the butter, instead of melting,
becomes this

58:57.579 --> 59:00.639
creamy, light, frothy,

59:00.749 --> 59:04.651
with kind of a fantastic subtle kind of...

59:05.253 --> 59:06.447
Tangy.

59:07.288 --> 59:09.017
It has a tanginess.

59:09.657 --> 59:11.022
Tanginess?

59:11.292 --> 59:12.418
Yes.

59:13.428 --> 59:14.952
Well, that's...

59:16.898 --> 59:18.695
That's who I married.

59:19.567 --> 59:21.398
Anyway,

59:21.469 --> 59:26.133
you serve it on fish and it's splendid.
I'm going to make it for you.

59:26.207 --> 59:27.936
- That'll be divine.
- Yeah.

59:28.009 --> 59:30.500
And, Dort, we're going to throw you a party.
