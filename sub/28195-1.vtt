Follow your dreams and don't hold back

00:29.750 --> 00:34.624
No matter how long it may take

00:47.000 --> 00:51.165
Follow your dreams and don't hold back

00:51.166 --> 00:52.249
(An Actor Prepares)

00:52.250 --> 00:56.832
Just like the howling wind

00:58.541 --> 00:59.665
ls someone hurt?

01:02.291 --> 01:04.331
Let's go check it out

01:07.791 --> 01:08.624
Old man, where are you hurt?

01:08.708 --> 01:09.957
It hurts

01:10.375 --> 01:11.124
Where?

01:11.208 --> 01:12.957
I don't know...everywhere

01:13.125 --> 01:13.915
Let me help you

01:13.958 --> 01:15.290
No...

01:16.500 --> 01:19.124
ls this a scam? ls it for real?

01:19.208 --> 01:20.915
Hello, Emergency?

01:21.166 --> 01:23.082
I'm here at Da Peng

01:23.708 --> 01:27.165
Pardon me Sir...I'm also an actor

01:27.375 --> 01:30.999
Your acting is not good.
Pain is the essence of a scam

01:31.083 --> 01:33.249
You're not showing enough emotion!
Not convincing enough!

01:33.333 --> 01:34.457
Ai-ya!

01:35.333 --> 01:36.457
Your 'Ai-ya'...is not gonna do it

01:36.541 --> 01:39.415
You were just hit by a car.
You can't just say 'Ai-ya'

01:39.500 --> 01:40.582
You need to be believable

01:40.666 --> 01:43.707
otherwise, you won't get
any sympathy from the audience

01:43.958 --> 01:45.582
Ohh...it really hurts

01:46.333 --> 01:47.624
No kidding dude!

01:47.708 --> 01:49.707
This is lame, be serious!

01:50.041 --> 01:51.165
Watch me

01:53.708 --> 01:54.832
I'm going to pass out!

01:55.708 --> 01:58.749
What...don't act smart!

01:58.833 --> 02:02.249
Fainting is fine, but don't rush it

02:03.208 --> 02:04.874
The blood looks good

02:05.000 --> 02:07.290
Too bad your acting lacked in the beginning

02:07.375 --> 02:09.539
You've already lost your audience

02:10.250 --> 02:12.457
Just sharing some tips with you

02:12.541 --> 02:13.749
Don't take it personally, Sir

02:14.208 --> 02:16.749
The ambulance's here

02:17.666 --> 02:18.582
Make way!

02:19.625 --> 02:22.290
Mild fracture in left chest,
third rib bone...not life-threatening

02:22.500 --> 02:23.457
Let's go

02:28.041 --> 02:29.165
Ready...up

02:30.416 --> 02:31.374
Careful

02:33.958 --> 02:35.290
I'm so sorry, Sir

02:35.750 --> 02:37.207
ls she a family member?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.540
She's just crazy...ignore her!

02:41.458 --> 02:42.415
Help!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.249
My leg...

02:49.000 --> 02:49.915
Cut!

02:50.208 --> 02:53.207
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Don't you know how to act?

02:53.791 --> 02:55.915
You're in pain! Why aren't you screaming?
Can't you act?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.124
Well, in my own experience...

02:58.208 --> 03:00.540
When people are in pain,
they don't always scream out loud

03:00.625 --> 03:01.749
What the hell are you talking about?!

03:02.750 --> 03:04.165
Hey mister...come here

03:04.458 --> 03:06.207
Can you do a painful reaction?

03:06.291 --> 03:07.665
Ah!

03:08.833 --> 03:10.040
That's so fake

03:10.375 --> 03:11.582
Let me show you

03:17.750 --> 03:20.457
That's real! See! No screaming, no shouting

03:20.541 --> 03:21.874
Please tell the director

03:22.958 --> 03:24.874
Director, what do you think?

03:25.291 --> 03:26.332
- I...
- Director?

03:26.791 --> 03:27.999
You...

03:29.875 --> 03:30.999
Get the hell out!

03:40.083 --> 03:41.290
Hey...

03:42.625 --> 03:45.540
Need extras to play dead.
Must keep the make-up on for two days

03:45.625 --> 03:47.207
- How much?
- Who wants to go?

03:47.458 --> 03:48.499
$400 for two days

03:48.583 --> 03:49.332
That's it?!

03:50.250 --> 03:51.290
I'll go!

03:51.625 --> 03:53.040
Any chance I can show my face?

03:53.125 --> 03:54.082
Are you bargaining with me?!

03:54.083 --> 03:55.790
If you show my face, just a meal will do

03:55.875 --> 03:56.832
Deal! Let's go!

03:56.833 --> 03:57.749
ls she crazy?

03:58.708 --> 03:59.499
Crazy!

04:51.333 --> 04:53.624
Come on, let's eat. Food's getting cold

04:55.458 --> 04:57.249
You're the birthday boy

04:57.333 --> 04:58.707
We can't eat until you start first

05:01.375 --> 05:02.207
Dad

05:03.083 --> 05:05.915
Happy birthday!

05:10.125 --> 05:10.915
Dreamy...

05:11.000 --> 05:12.665
Your make-up's very unique

05:13.000 --> 05:14.249
It's quite terrifying!

05:14.541 --> 05:15.832
ls acting fun?

05:16.458 --> 05:18.082
I get to play a corpse this time

05:18.166 --> 05:20.540
There's a close-up
so I can show my acting skills

05:21.125 --> 05:23.332
Show your acting skills by playing a corpse?

05:23.541 --> 05:24.165
Dad...

05:24.250 --> 05:27.957
Death makes an interesting context for actors

05:28.041 --> 05:29.040
Imagine...

05:29.250 --> 05:30.582
If you were chopped dead alive...

05:30.666 --> 05:31.582
The feel of that scene...

05:31.666 --> 05:32.374
What did you say?!!

05:32.458 --> 05:33.499
Say it again!!

05:33.625 --> 05:35.832
Birthdays should be a happy occasion

05:36.041 --> 05:38.999
Dreamy, stop the nonsense
and remove your make-up!

05:39.708 --> 05:41.040
But I still have a shooting tomorrow

05:41.250 --> 05:43.457
You really think you're a big movie star?!

05:44.125 --> 05:45.624
You guys grew up together, right?

05:45.791 --> 05:46.790
Look at Bobby!

05:46.875 --> 05:48.707
He's now a big-time lawyer!

05:49.416 --> 05:51.207
It's nothing much...nothing to brag about

05:51.291 --> 05:52.290
And look at Peggy!

05:52.375 --> 05:53.332
She's happily married...

05:53.500 --> 05:54.874
With a great husband!

05:55.083 --> 05:56.499
But look at you now!

05:56.750 --> 05:59.124
We'd hoped you would become a lawyer

05:59.458 --> 06:00.874
Not a corpse!

06:01.458 --> 06:05.415
Everyone has their own talents...even a corpse

06:05.500 --> 06:07.707
I'm an extra but I can take care of myself

06:08.083 --> 06:09.457
I have my own dreams too

06:09.708 --> 06:12.999
You're thirty already and
you've been an extra for over a decade

06:13.125 --> 06:14.374
Have you ever played the lead?

06:14.458 --> 06:17.790
I believe in my talents. If I work hard...

06:17.958 --> 06:19.624
I can definitely make it as the lead actress

06:20.666 --> 06:21.832
Sorry, I choked on water!

06:22.541 --> 06:23.749
Mum, am I right?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.040
Yes...you can do it

06:25.875 --> 06:27.082
That's bullshit!

06:27.416 --> 06:29.165
You've spoiled her!

06:29.750 --> 06:32.124
I'm giving you one last chance!

06:32.375 --> 06:34.832
Take that thing off and burn it!

06:34.958 --> 06:36.040
Cleaver is not flammable, right?

06:36.291 --> 06:37.749
Then I'll add one more!

06:41.125 --> 06:42.124
You asked for it!

06:42.500 --> 06:43.374
Wait a second!

06:43.541 --> 06:45.540
Your emotions are so inspiring!

06:45.625 --> 06:47.165
Dad, hold the cleaver and hop again

06:47.250 --> 06:47.999
I want to record this

06:48.083 --> 06:49.665
Ready, jump!

06:50.375 --> 06:51.207
Jump!

06:52.291 --> 06:53.582
Daughter, what are you doing?

06:53.666 --> 06:54.915
Auntie, we'll be leaving now

06:55.041 --> 06:55.790
So sorry!

06:55.875 --> 06:56.790
Get out!

06:59.666 --> 07:01.207
I'm disowning you!

07:03.541 --> 07:05.290
And take your trash with you!

07:07.250 --> 07:09.499
But Dad...that's your trash

07:10.083 --> 07:11.582
I don't give a damn!

07:12.541 --> 07:14.207
You total bum!

07:14.708 --> 07:16.540
Get the hell out of here!

07:16.833 --> 07:20.040
Please calm down!

07:20.125 --> 07:22.040
I'll beat you up everytime I see you!

07:24.333 --> 07:25.124
Hey!

07:25.291 --> 07:26.540
Can anyone act here?!

07:26.625 --> 07:28.749
I can!

07:28.833 --> 07:29.749
You

07:29.916 --> 07:30.957
Do a happy face

07:31.333 --> 07:32.374
Do a sad face

07:32.625 --> 07:33.707
Alright, come with me

07:34.166 --> 07:35.290
Who can do an angry look?

07:35.375 --> 07:36.207
Me! Me! Me!

07:36.291 --> 07:37.124
You

07:38.416 --> 07:39.249
Get lost!

07:39.333 --> 07:40.124
You try

07:41.541 --> 07:42.665
Okay, very good

07:43.208 --> 07:44.915
Someone react to a deathly blow

07:45.041 --> 07:45.832
Me! Me! Me!

07:45.916 --> 07:46.707
You

07:47.166 --> 07:49.374
Can you specify the type of deathly blow?

07:49.458 --> 07:52.249
What's with all the questions?
Get lost if you can't do it...

07:52.333 --> 07:53.207
How about "Icy Palm Attack"?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.457
Okay, Icy Palm Attack

08:02.916 --> 08:06.124
so cold...

08:08.500 --> 08:12.457
See a doctor if you're sick...
Don't give it to me!

08:13.166 --> 08:13.957
You! Try!

08:14.041 --> 08:16.249
Why are you dragging me here? I'm not going!

08:16.333 --> 08:17.540
Just want to bring her some soup

08:17.625 --> 08:20.290
Soup for her?! Are you on her side?

08:20.541 --> 08:22.832
Just pretend we're passing by

08:22.916 --> 08:25.624
If I see her, I'm gonna hit her! Don't stop me!

08:25.708 --> 08:27.290
Or I'll hit you too!

08:27.500 --> 08:32.499
You're asking for it! What's wrong with you?!

08:32.582 --> 08:35.164
Why do you need to know everything?

08:36.082 --> 08:37.582
I just want to build up my character

08:37.666 --> 08:39.457
Build my ass!

08:39.541 --> 08:42.539
No one will even see you! Are you the lead?

08:42.625 --> 08:44.749
Would you get it if I gave you the context?

08:44.833 --> 08:47.707
You won't! You're just an extra!

08:47.875 --> 08:49.249
Go, come with me

08:49.666 --> 08:50.665
That was intense

08:57.125 --> 08:57.790
Hello

08:57.875 --> 08:58.624
What?

08:58.833 --> 09:00.249
Couldn't you be nicer?

09:01.208 --> 09:04.290
Why blow up over a simple question?

09:04.375 --> 09:05.499
None of you business!

09:05.708 --> 09:08.124
She's serious about acting. Can't you see that?

09:08.875 --> 09:09.540
Who?

09:09.625 --> 09:11.415
You know who I'm talking about!

09:11.500 --> 09:12.915
God is watching what you're doing!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.290
Be careful...karma!

09:14.375 --> 09:16.332
Crazy! PA...come here!

09:17.333 --> 09:18.457
I'm sorry

09:20.250 --> 09:21.249
Do you know who I am?

09:21.333 --> 09:22.082
No!

09:22.625 --> 09:23.999
- Good
- Let's go

09:31.541 --> 09:32.332
Hello

09:32.833 --> 09:36.374
Your acting in Icy Palm Attack
had a lot of depth. It hit the mark

09:37.125 --> 09:38.374
It was alright

09:38.583 --> 09:42.665
The key is imagination...
immerse yourself into the scene

09:43.125 --> 09:44.082
That's amazing!

09:44.208 --> 09:45.082
I'm Young

09:45.166 --> 09:46.290
I'm Dreamy

09:46.666 --> 09:48.165
You're reading this book too?

09:48.458 --> 09:49.457
Yes!

09:50.041 --> 09:51.374
You like "King of Comedy" too?

09:51.458 --> 09:53.124
I love it! I memorized all the lines!

09:53.208 --> 09:54.332
Wanna give it a go?

09:54.583 --> 09:55.332
Right here?

09:55.416 --> 09:56.624
Why not?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.874
Hey...

10:03.291 --> 10:03.999
What?

10:04.416 --> 10:05.165
Are you leaving?

10:05.666 --> 10:06.415
Yes

10:06.500 --> 10:07.332
Where are you going?

10:07.416 --> 10:08.165
Home

10:08.541 --> 10:09.457
And then?

10:09.541 --> 10:10.374
Off to work

10:11.250 --> 10:12.540
Do you have to go to work?

10:12.625 --> 10:13.957
Who will take care of me if I don't work?

10:20.833 --> 10:21.790
Hey!

10:24.708 --> 10:25.457
What now?

10:31.333 --> 10:32.415
I'll take care of you

10:36.916 --> 10:38.415
My boyfriend's here

10:38.791 --> 10:40.415
Hey, that's the wrong line

10:41.125 --> 10:43.749
No, my boyfriend's really here

10:47.166 --> 10:48.040
See you!

10:49.750 --> 10:50.624
Who's that guy?

10:50.833 --> 10:51.749
Some colleague

10:51.833 --> 10:52.665
Really?

10:52.750 --> 10:55.582
Yes. Let's go!

11:14.250 --> 11:16.082
You can have my sausage

11:18.416 --> 11:19.457
Let's share

11:26.958 --> 11:30.999
I put $4,000 into our wedding fund this month

11:31.666 --> 11:33.790
You only make $5,000 a month.
If you give me $4,000...

11:33.875 --> 11:35.124
How would you survive?

11:35.583 --> 11:37.249
$1 ,000 is enough for me

11:37.333 --> 11:39.124
I get meals on the movie set
so it doesn't cost me a penny

11:39.208 --> 11:40.207
Let me contribute $4,500...

11:40.291 --> 11:41.415
So take back $500

11:42.666 --> 11:43.665
No, don't worry

11:43.750 --> 11:45.332
We agreed to half each

11:46.625 --> 11:48.415
I thought my love was deeper

11:48.708 --> 11:50.707
But turns out, your love is just as deep

11:54.041 --> 11:55.290
You're really giving him your money?

11:55.583 --> 11:56.457
Of course

11:56.541 --> 11:57.790
Then why not give it to me?

11:57.791 --> 11:59.540
But I'm not getting married to you!

12:00.333 --> 12:02.082
You might as well be with me then

12:02.208 --> 12:03.582
Lend me your soap

12:10.083 --> 12:12.957
Why do you keep staring at Mimi?
Do you like her?

12:13.041 --> 12:14.749
Pisses me off if you say that!

12:14.833 --> 12:16.082
Looking doesn't mean I like her!

12:16.166 --> 12:18.332
I despise her from the bottom of my heart

12:18.416 --> 12:19.707
She's so cheap!

12:19.791 --> 12:21.249
Don't you think Mimi's pretty?

12:21.333 --> 12:22.624
Beauty means nothing...

12:22.708 --> 12:24.082
If she's got nothing inside

12:25.041 --> 12:26.415
You know why I love you?

12:26.500 --> 12:27.499
Why?

12:27.708 --> 12:29.415
Because you have taste

12:30.166 --> 12:31.249
Of course!

12:31.666 --> 12:32.624
Dear...

12:33.250 --> 12:35.165
I want to introduce you to my parents

12:35.625 --> 12:38.707
They'll be so relieved to know we're together

12:38.833 --> 12:40.082
That's for sure

12:40.291 --> 12:43.290
Actually, I'm busy with a big project now

12:43.375 --> 12:44.999
When accomplished...

12:45.083 --> 12:47.457
Your Mum and Dad will be so proud of me

12:47.708 --> 12:50.457
Not to brag but, I, Charlie...

12:50.708 --> 12:52.790
Shall be the next Bill Gates!

12:53.541 --> 12:55.665
Aren't you being too ambitious?

12:55.750 --> 12:58.707
Let's be realistic and
go for number two or even three?

12:58.791 --> 13:00.124
I am very humble and realistic!

13:00.458 --> 13:01.874
How many eyes does Bill Gates have?

13:01.958 --> 13:02.624
Two

13:02.708 --> 13:03.874
How many eyes do I have?

13:03.958 --> 13:04.499
Two

13:04.583 --> 13:06.624
He doesn't have more and I don't have any less

13:06.708 --> 13:07.915
- ls that right?
- Yes!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.415
Whatever he can do, I'm capable of it too!

13:10.583 --> 13:11.832
Absolutely right!

13:11.916 --> 13:14.749
Listen to me. You must believe you're the best!

13:14.833 --> 13:17.499
Not be second or third place!
You are number one!

13:17.583 --> 13:20.082
Stop thinking about those online videos

13:20.166 --> 13:22.290
Go for the big global movies!

13:23.041 --> 13:26.540
Actually, an international production is
looking for Chinese actors

13:26.625 --> 13:28.374
That's your chance!

13:29.458 --> 13:31.624
But they're looking for Snow White

13:31.708 --> 13:33.332
You're Snow White!

13:33.416 --> 13:34.249
Me?

13:34.333 --> 13:35.915
How many eyes does Snow White have?

13:36.000 --> 13:36.624
Two

13:36.708 --> 13:37.874
How many eyes do you have?

13:37.958 --> 13:38.707
Two

13:38.791 --> 13:41.915
So why can't you be Snow White?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.374
Tell me! Why not?

13:44.833 --> 13:46.207
Tell me!

13:46.625 --> 13:48.165
Ask yourself...

13:48.500 --> 13:49.999
Am I right?

13:50.458 --> 13:52.290
Doesn't it make sense?

13:52.666 --> 13:54.040
You are...

13:54.333 --> 13:55.957
Snow White!

14:05.791 --> 14:07.790
You really want to get beauty injections?

14:08.875 --> 14:10.957
Well...Snow White is a Western classic

14:11.041 --> 14:13.290
Reckon adding some
Western features to my face...

14:13.375 --> 14:14.874
Wow, you've even thought of that

14:14.958 --> 14:16.832
Famous actors do it all the time

14:16.916 --> 14:19.624
Marlon Brando went
all out to get the Godfather role

14:19.708 --> 14:22.124
He did a lot to change his face

14:22.208 --> 14:24.457
Bullshit! You just want to look better
with cosmetic surgery

14:24.666 --> 14:25.915
You wrong me!

14:26.666 --> 14:29.290
Getting prettier is surely a good thing

14:30.791 --> 14:32.832
I found this amazing beauty App!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.957
SoYoung Medical Aesthetic App

14:36.125 --> 14:39.582
It shows all the information and
the different cases

14:39.708 --> 14:41.707
I actually know a 80 year old well known brand

14:41.791 --> 14:42.749
Where?

14:49.000 --> 14:49.874
Here we are

14:52.750 --> 14:55.082
Doctor, here's a new customer for you

15:01.666 --> 15:02.832
What would you like to do?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.374
I want to look like her

15:13.333 --> 15:14.415
Are you sure?

15:14.500 --> 15:17.457
It's my first time. I'm a bit nervous

15:18.250 --> 15:21.582
This style is also my first time.
I'm a bit nervous too!

15:22.250 --> 15:24.290
You do Chinese faces more often right?

15:25.166 --> 15:26.499
Honestly...

15:26.583 --> 15:28.415
I usually do humans

15:30.333 --> 15:32.082
Do you want the hair too?

15:32.708 --> 15:33.582
What hair?

15:34.083 --> 15:35.582
There's hair all over

15:37.708 --> 15:40.040
Right...they're more hairy...

15:40.166 --> 15:42.165
But most people won't notice

15:43.708 --> 15:45.874
It's hard not to notice

15:46.291 --> 15:48.749
You're so professional.
But I'll pass on the hair

15:49.375 --> 15:50.707
What a shame!

15:53.166 --> 15:55.499
The effect will only lasts for two days

15:56.875 --> 15:59.665
It's simple...very quick

16:08.916 --> 16:11.207
Doctor, I want a tall upward nose

16:15.791 --> 16:18.124
More upwards...your nostril will be
as big as a yin-yang hotpot

16:19.125 --> 16:19.999
Yin-yang hotpot?

16:20.166 --> 16:22.332
Whatever you like

16:26.291 --> 16:27.249
Doctor

16:27.708 --> 16:30.165
Why do you keep looking at that gorilla?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.499
I need to look at it so I know what to do!

16:33.166 --> 16:34.165
Why?

16:34.250 --> 16:35.957
You wanted this gorilla look, right?

16:39.291 --> 16:40.624
No, not that!

16:40.708 --> 16:41.915
I wanted this!

16:42.000 --> 16:43.624
Why didn't you say so?!

16:43.708 --> 16:44.540
I want a mirror!

16:44.625 --> 16:46.749
Don't look! You can't take it!

16:46.833 --> 16:48.332
Relax, I can fix it!

16:48.416 --> 16:49.540
Just lie down

16:51.083 --> 16:52.540
Alright, it's done!

16:55.250 --> 16:56.540
How is it? Let me see...

16:57.875 --> 16:58.874
How do I look?

17:00.000 --> 17:00.915
It's gorgeous!

17:01.250 --> 17:02.374
How gorgeous?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.207
Too gorgeous to look at

17:05.250 --> 17:06.832
It's much better now

17:14.208 --> 17:14.957
Next

17:14.958 --> 17:16.499
(Snow White audition. Line up here)

17:20.500 --> 17:21.415
Wait there

17:31.083 --> 17:31.915

Which role?

17:34.916 --> 17:35.915
Snow White

17:37.000 --> 17:37.915
Why?

17:39.416 --> 17:42.624
Because I want to audition for Snow White

17:43.083 --> 17:43.832
Say again?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.665
Why am I repeating?

17:47.416 --> 17:48.415
Not sure I heard you right

17:50.583 --> 17:52.957
I'm here to audition for Snow White

17:54.125 --> 17:55.040
Say that again

17:56.958 --> 17:58.499
Never mind...sorry

17:59.541 --> 18:01.207
Stay there!

18:01.291 --> 18:02.874
Stop that woman!

18:02.958 --> 18:03.665
Don't let her go!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.040
Stop her!

18:06.041 --> 18:07.082
Get her!

18:09.000 --> 18:09.832
Don't Run!

18:12.625 --> 18:13.499
Stop her!

18:13.916 --> 18:14.707
Come with me!

18:14.791 --> 18:15.790
Wanna run?

18:16.541 --> 18:17.665
You can't get away?

18:18.000 --> 18:18.999
Wanna run?

18:19.583 --> 18:22.207
I'm so sorry!
It was just my wishful thinking...

18:22.291 --> 18:23.415
I shouldn't have come!

18:23.500 --> 18:24.457
Boss, take a look

18:25.500 --> 18:26.457
What do you think?

18:27.916 --> 18:28.790
Get to work!

18:29.291 --> 18:30.832
Please don't!

18:31.083 --> 18:33.415
I won't do it again!

18:34.750 --> 18:35.749
Neck...thirty-three

18:35.833 --> 18:37.165
Start working!

18:37.958 --> 18:39.624
Sleeve...sixty

18:42.666 --> 18:43.665
What's going on?

18:43.916 --> 18:45.082
Don't move

18:48.333 --> 18:49.749
Please tell me what's going on?

18:49.833 --> 18:51.124
You got the role

18:52.083 --> 18:54.582
Director, we're almost ready

18:54.583 --> 18:55.874
I got it?!

18:56.625 --> 18:57.874
We're ready...

18:57.958 --> 18:59.040
Hurry up!

18:59.041 --> 18:59.915
(Miracles happen here)

18:59.916 --> 19:01.249
Let's go!

19:06.833 --> 19:09.249
May I know what this scene's about?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.082
Don't worry about it.
We'll tell you after we shoot

19:11.166 --> 19:12.915
What's the character's emotional state?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.082
Great!

19:14.500 --> 19:16.540
Good idea! Actor's on the way...

19:16.625 --> 19:17.915
Ready...

19:19.083 --> 19:20.457
Stay here!

19:26.166 --> 19:26.832

19:29.708 --> 19:30.999

19:31.541 --> 19:32.749

19:39.708 --> 19:40.540

19:43.875 --> 19:45.207
Okay. Switch to the actor

19:45.500 --> 19:47.332
Lose the double! Actor, ready for your lines!

19:48.083 --> 19:49.374
Take her away!

19:50.000 --> 19:51.249
Hurry up!

19:52.083 --> 19:53.082
Move aside!

19:53.750 --> 19:54.790

19:56.416 --> 20:01.290
Go ahead! I'm not afraid to die!

20:02.375 --> 20:03.707
Cut!

20:04.083 --> 20:04.665
Okay

20:05.291 --> 20:06.124
Keep beating

20:06.250 --> 20:08.165
Actor, take a break. Double, take over

20:08.375 --> 20:09.499
Thank you

20:10.750 --> 20:12.082
- Come
- Tilt your head up

20:12.583 --> 20:13.582
Tilt your head

20:13.666 --> 20:15.040
- Stay sharp
- Come on...hold up your finger

20:15.750 --> 20:18.082
Point your finger up

20:18.166 --> 20:19.290
Posture, don't collapse

20:20.125 --> 20:21.374
Action!

20:46.750 --> 20:48.540
- Cut!
- Cut!

20:48.875 --> 20:49.790
Wonderful!

20:50.500 --> 20:53.499
The Seven Dwarves have
finally avenged Snow White

20:53.875 --> 20:54.999
This is so touching

20:55.416 --> 20:56.457
Director

20:57.083 --> 20:58.499
Aren't I supposed to be Snow White?

20:58.500 --> 20:59.332
What the hell are you doing?

20:59.333 --> 20:59.915
Get lost!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.749
- Sorry, Director
- Take her away

21:01.833 --> 21:02.999
Director!

21:03.083 --> 21:04.040
Sorry

21:04.166 --> 21:05.332
Ready for Snow White's scene

21:05.416 --> 21:06.415
Okay

21:17.500 --> 21:18.249
Mr. Marco

21:18.333 --> 21:22.290
Tell that 'has-been' to hurry up.
Need him on set

21:22.375 --> 21:23.499
Who's the 'has-been'?

21:23.958 --> 21:24.832
Me

21:26.041 --> 21:27.040
Watch your mouth!

21:27.125 --> 21:27.999
Sure

21:35.208 --> 21:38.790
(Snow White - Bloodbath in Chinatown)

21:43.375 --> 21:45.915
Make way! Make way! Mr. Marco is coming!

21:47.666 --> 21:48.540
We'll do company move after this scene...

21:48.541 --> 21:50.290
Director, please pick the female
version of Snow White

21:50.375 --> 21:52.790
Any pretty face will do...there's only one shot

21:52.875 --> 21:54.540
Mr. Marco is here! Stay calm!

21:54.625 --> 21:56.540
Attention, everyone! Make way!

21:56.625 --> 21:57.832
Go away! Stay away!

21:57.833 --> 22:00.082
Go away! Don't come over!

22:00.375 --> 22:02.082
Stay calm! No pushing!

22:02.166 --> 22:03.832
No touching! No photo!

22:05.125 --> 22:06.207
Mr. Marco...

22:06.291 --> 22:08.999
In this scene, you will play Snow White

22:09.083 --> 22:10.415
The evil witch tricked you into eating...

22:10.500 --> 22:12.957
A poisonous banana and then you became a man

22:13.041 --> 22:15.040
The prince got too drunk to realize...

22:15.125 --> 22:16.290
that he slept with you

22:16.375 --> 22:17.749
Did I do him? Or did he do me?

22:17.833 --> 22:19.124
Both ways

22:19.333 --> 22:21.082
When the prince woke up,
he found out you were a man

22:21.166 --> 22:23.249
He couldn't accept it so he tried to kill you

22:23.333 --> 22:25.332
But you killed him first

22:25.416 --> 22:27.749
The prince's men tracked you down in Chinatown

22:27.833 --> 22:29.457
They attacked you

22:29.541 --> 22:33.665
You were badly hurt...
your guts came spilling out

22:35.708 --> 22:37.040
Isn't that gruesome?!

22:37.958 --> 22:41.124
It's my tribute to Zhang Che's
Aesthetic of Violence

22:41.208 --> 22:43.040
Zhang Che, Aesthetic of Violence

22:43.166 --> 22:44.374
Do you get it?

22:44.458 --> 22:45.290
Fine

22:45.375 --> 22:47.082
Not fine or not.
It's whether you get it or not?

22:47.166 --> 22:47.957
What do you think?

22:48.041 --> 22:49.332
It's hard to say

22:49.416 --> 22:51.832
Of course I get it! You meant violent right?

22:51.916 --> 22:52.832
Perfect!

22:52.916 --> 22:56.207
Let's do the scene when you get stabbed
and you're angry. Okay?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.374
Okay, let's begin!

22:58.875 --> 23:00.415
Mr. Marco, let me set up the props

23:03.916 --> 23:04.999
Camera

23:06.041 --> 23:06.874
Take one

23:07.333 --> 23:08.165
Action!

23:08.666 --> 23:09.499
I...

23:11.166 --> 23:12.207
I am so angry...

23:12.666 --> 23:13.582
Cut!

23:14.166 --> 23:16.499
Mr. Marco, can you try to be really angry?

23:16.750 --> 23:18.790
I already said I'm angry

23:18.875 --> 23:19.999
You all heard it, right?

23:20.541 --> 23:22.540
Director, only you didn't hear what I said

23:22.625 --> 23:23.707
Do you think I'm lying?

23:24.291 --> 23:25.124
It's hard to say

23:25.333 --> 23:27.957
Then don't say anything! No one is forcing you!

23:29.333 --> 23:30.957
Can you be more girly?

23:30.958 --> 23:32.540
That's what I said!

23:32.625 --> 23:34.457
I'm a princess after all

23:34.541 --> 23:35.999
You are really slow

23:36.125 --> 23:36.874
Come on!

23:36.958 --> 23:37.874
One more time!

23:38.208 --> 23:38.874
Action!

23:40.833 --> 23:42.790
I am so angry...

23:44.958 --> 23:47.915
I am really...

23:48.458 --> 23:50.040
Bloody hell!

23:50.125 --> 23:51.124
What the hell is this?

23:52.041 --> 23:53.499
Cut! Wrong lines

23:53.583 --> 23:55.915
What the...You thought that was a line?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.124
How did my guts become hotdogs?

23:58.208 --> 24:00.915
Mr. Marco, listen to me.
A New Year film can't be too violent

24:01.000 --> 24:02.874
What about all that "as..." violent crap?!

24:02.958 --> 24:04.165
- Aesthetic of Violence
- Attention! Attention!

24:04.250 --> 24:06.040
Attention, everyone! Attention!
Mr. Marco is pissed off!

24:06.125 --> 24:08.082
I was just about to get into character!

24:08.166 --> 24:09.499
Why did you interrupt me?

24:09.583 --> 24:12.665
Even though this is
a movie with aesthetic of violence...

24:12.750 --> 24:15.624
...it can still be innocent

24:15.708 --> 24:18.915
Seeing my guts as hotdogs...

24:19.000 --> 24:20.415
I almost burst out laughing!

24:20.500 --> 24:21.624
How can I get into character?

24:21.708 --> 24:23.832
The business side is very complicated

24:23.916 --> 24:25.124
You're an amazing actor...

24:25.208 --> 24:27.332
the hotdogs won't be a problem for you!

24:28.041 --> 24:29.457
Of course it won't!

24:29.875 --> 24:31.957
But you're insulting
the audience's intelligence

24:32.375 --> 24:33.665
New Year movie

24:33.750 --> 24:36.957
You might as well add some cute kidneys!

24:39.333 --> 24:41.249
- Props! Get me a kidney!
- Copy that

24:41.333 --> 24:42.499
Right away!

24:43.291 --> 24:44.707
Director, would this work?

24:45.125 --> 24:46.207
Dip it into the ketchup and let's see...

24:46.291 --> 24:47.040
Okay

24:49.166 --> 24:51.207
Oh my God! So bloody and innocent!

24:51.291 --> 24:52.374
That's it

24:52.541 --> 24:54.874
Ready! Actors in position!

25:05.208 --> 25:06.457
Not yet cut?!

25:06.791 --> 25:07.874
I'm worn out!

25:08.916 --> 25:10.124
Attention everyone! Attention!

25:10.208 --> 25:11.832
Mr. Marco is here. Make way!

25:11.916 --> 25:13.290
Attention everyone! Attention!
Mr. Marco is coming!

25:13.375 --> 25:15.749
Stupid director...making a stupid movie!

25:15.958 --> 25:17.749
In the old days, I would've slapped him!

25:17.833 --> 25:18.999
Why don't you now?

25:19.166 --> 25:21.374
I'm a classy gentleman now!

25:21.875 --> 25:22.790
What are you laughing at?!

25:26.375 --> 25:27.374
You fool

25:29.000 --> 25:30.249
Are you mocking me?

25:31.541 --> 25:33.499
How dare you mock me?

25:34.000 --> 25:34.874
You think I'm funny, huh?!

25:34.958 --> 25:36.249
Attention, everybody! Attention!
Mr. Marco is kicking!

25:36.333 --> 25:38.499
No kidding! Mr. Marco is kicking!

25:38.583 --> 25:39.665
No touching! No photo!

25:39.750 --> 25:40.540
Self control!

25:42.958 --> 25:43.832
Dreamy

25:44.625 --> 25:45.665
ls it really you?

25:46.000 --> 25:46.832
Young

25:46.916 --> 25:47.832
Yes

25:48.666 --> 25:50.165
ls it a special make-up?

25:50.250 --> 25:51.165
Yes

25:51.583 --> 25:52.665
Everything's okay?

25:53.166 --> 25:54.165
I'm fine

25:54.666 --> 25:55.874
You can have my meal

25:55.958 --> 25:57.082
Don't worry

26:01.833 --> 26:03.207
Excuse me

26:03.291 --> 26:05.165
Mister, can I get another meal please?

26:06.500 --> 26:07.874
One for each person

26:07.958 --> 26:09.915
You 'extras' are always so greedy!

26:10.000 --> 26:10.874
Get lost!

26:12.916 --> 26:16.499
If you come back, I'll call the cops!

26:21.250 --> 26:22.957
I told you guys earlier

26:23.041 --> 26:24.457
God is watching everything you do!

26:24.541 --> 26:26.624
Why are you always so mean?!

26:26.916 --> 26:27.790
What?

26:27.916 --> 26:29.915
Aren't those lunch boxes for eating?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.249
What the hell?!

26:31.625 --> 26:34.874
Tell me!

26:35.500 --> 26:37.165
Tell you what?!

26:39.375 --> 26:41.624
Aren't those lunch boxes for eating?

26:41.708 --> 26:42.832
Yes, so what?

26:42.916 --> 26:44.124
Why didn't she get one?

26:44.208 --> 26:45.499
Who?!!

26:45.583 --> 26:47.582
That girl with special make-up

26:48.250 --> 26:51.707
Answer me!

26:52.166 --> 26:53.290
Calm down!

26:53.375 --> 26:54.915
- Why didn't she get one?
- Calm down!

26:55.000 --> 26:57.040
Why didn't she get one?

26:57.125 --> 26:57.999
Hold on!

27:10.333 --> 27:11.999
Why did you hit yourself with a bottle?

27:12.083 --> 27:13.332
I couldn't hit him, could I?

27:13.458 --> 27:15.082
Didn't you see how big he was?

27:24.125 --> 27:25.415
Did you see our daughter?

27:26.166 --> 27:26.957
No

27:27.458 --> 27:28.499
So we just leave?

27:28.666 --> 27:29.540
Yeah

27:41.208 --> 27:44.040
I saw Marco on set the other day

27:44.125 --> 27:45.999
- Who's Marco?
- That Marco

27:46.083 --> 27:47.374
- Who?
- Never mind

27:47.458 --> 27:50.207
He was in a bad mood...
he kicked away my lunch box

27:50.291 --> 27:53.499
So I asked the PA for another one,
but he wouldn't give it to me

27:53.583 --> 27:56.957
But suddenly as I was leaving, he gave me one

27:57.041 --> 27:59.124
ls good luck coming my way?

27:59.375 --> 28:01.624
You're just an extra. Don't overthink it

28:01.708 --> 28:03.249
Have some respect for extras

28:03.333 --> 28:05.749
Many stars started as extras

28:05.833 --> 28:08.249
Sun Li, Carina Lau, Zhao Liying...

28:08.333 --> 28:09.665
Are you as talented as them?

28:09.875 --> 28:11.040
We're all special in our own ways

28:11.125 --> 28:12.624
And I work harder than them

28:12.708 --> 28:13.707
You're delusional

28:13.791 --> 28:16.957
So work hard and you'll have a chance

28:17.041 --> 28:20.999
No one gets discovered
just standing on the streets

28:21.458 --> 28:22.332
Excuse me, Miss

28:23.750 --> 28:25.082
Would you like to be in a movie?

28:25.458 --> 28:26.499
Who are you?

28:26.833 --> 28:28.124
She's a famous producer

28:28.208 --> 28:29.999
Hi, I'm Dreamy...I'm an actor

28:30.083 --> 28:32.832
Hi...we're looking for actors in our movie

28:33.000 --> 28:34.207
Are you interested?

28:34.291 --> 28:35.999
Yes, I want to try!

28:36.083 --> 28:36.999
Oh sorry...

28:37.083 --> 28:38.082
Not you

28:38.166 --> 28:39.082
It's you

28:40.083 --> 28:40.790
Me?

28:40.875 --> 28:42.749
Yes, I've been talking to you

28:42.833 --> 28:45.540
How about it? We're just over there

29:13.625 --> 29:14.874
Don't be sad

29:15.125 --> 29:16.749
Consider it a game

29:17.083 --> 29:18.165
Don't cry

29:18.375 --> 29:20.499
They picked me for the female lead!

29:21.083 --> 29:21.999
Really?

29:22.875 --> 29:25.290
I know nothing. Why would they pick me?

29:25.416 --> 29:28.165
I went in and they removed my make-up.
Said only two lines...

29:28.250 --> 29:30.790
Then I got the lead! What should I do now?

29:30.875 --> 29:33.374
What do you mean? It's a great opportunity!

29:33.458 --> 29:36.415
I would trade fifty years of my life
for this chance!

29:36.500 --> 29:37.999
But I don't want it!

29:38.083 --> 29:41.124
I'm so scared. I don't want to be an actor!

29:46.083 --> 29:48.624
It's okay...don't cry

29:48.916 --> 29:53.665
I'm so innocent,
the industry will pollute my innocence

29:55.500 --> 29:56.999
I don't mind to be polluted,
perhaps you can tell them...

29:57.083 --> 29:59.249
I can take your place

29:59.333 --> 30:01.874
I beg them to take you...

30:01.958 --> 30:04.874
But they said they would rather die

30:05.166 --> 30:06.582
They would rather die?

30:06.666 --> 30:09.707
Yes, they said they would rather die

30:11.500 --> 30:12.957
- Would rather die
- What should I do?

30:14.666 --> 30:15.499
Car's here

30:15.583 --> 30:17.040
Okay. ls everything fine?

30:17.125 --> 30:18.665
- Yes...
- Hi

30:19.000 --> 30:20.207
You still here

30:20.291 --> 30:22.207
Thank you for giving me the chance

30:22.291 --> 30:23.582
- Do your best
- Sure

30:23.666 --> 30:24.707
You want a ride?

30:24.791 --> 30:26.374
Sure, I live nearby

30:27.708 --> 30:28.707
Thank you

30:31.375 --> 30:32.290
Take the back seat

30:46.708 --> 30:48.665
Mimi moved out just like that?

30:50.375 --> 30:52.207
Everything's gone

30:53.041 --> 30:55.707
She even took my soap and sanitary pads

30:57.416 --> 30:59.165
Told you so

30:59.416 --> 31:00.415
Cheap!

31:02.958 --> 31:05.624
If I hadn't ask Mimi to eat with me...

31:06.250 --> 31:10.582
they would have picked me

31:10.750 --> 31:13.957
Even without Mimi,
they might not have picked you

31:18.625 --> 31:21.415
Don't people said 'hard work pays off'?

31:21.875 --> 31:25.790
So that opportunity
wasn't meant for you, but for Mimi

31:25.875 --> 31:29.540
But if she doesn't try her best,
she will eventually screw up

31:29.625 --> 31:32.665
Hang in there. You'll make it!

31:38.250 --> 31:41.290
You're right! I'll try even harder

31:42.416 --> 31:46.582
I'll send out my CV all over China,
I want everyone knows

31:46.666 --> 31:48.499
what acting actually means!

31:48.583 --> 31:49.790
Well said!

31:49.875 --> 31:51.665
Be positive!

31:51.750 --> 31:55.165
I'm short on cash for my start-up,
but I still have hope

31:55.250 --> 31:56.082
How much do you need?

31:56.166 --> 31:57.165
$20,000

31:57.583 --> 31:59.040
Just use the wedding fund

31:59.125 --> 32:02.457
No! Then we would never get married

32:02.541 --> 32:04.832
Maybe I can work overtime or get a second job

32:04.916 --> 32:07.665
Let me worry about it

32:07.750 --> 32:09.332
I don't want you to suffer

32:20.750 --> 32:22.665
Hey boss

32:26.083 --> 32:26.915
Excuse me

32:27.333 --> 32:27.957
Boss

32:28.041 --> 32:30.665
I need money.
Do you have any work that pays more?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.707
Are you serious? Who do you think you are?!

32:32.791 --> 32:35.207
I'll do anything

32:35.625 --> 32:38.082
Please...thank you

32:47.416 --> 32:48.415
Cut!

32:48.833 --> 32:51.332
Are you kidding me?

32:52.166 --> 32:53.707
She looks perfect

32:53.875 --> 32:57.207
Get lost! Don't know what the hell
you're saying!

32:58.250 --> 33:00.290
Who hired the double?

33:01.666 --> 33:04.540
Old hag, I beg you! Put on some clothes!

33:05.791 --> 33:07.415
- Get out!
- Man, she's scary!

33:07.500 --> 33:08.582
Sorry, Director

33:08.666 --> 33:10.249
I didn't know she looks hideous unclothed

33:10.333 --> 33:13.207
Are you joking? This double sucks!

33:13.500 --> 33:15.999
Bad figure and sagging skin

33:16.083 --> 33:17.165
And black dots on her ass

33:17.250 --> 33:17.874
Sorry, Director

33:17.958 --> 33:20.040
You might as well have asked me to do it!

33:20.500 --> 33:22.499
- Go get me another one!
- Dreamy

33:23.166 --> 33:24.290
Are you okay?

33:25.000 --> 33:25.874
I'm fine

33:26.250 --> 33:28.665
The director said my body and skin suck

33:28.750 --> 33:30.374
And begged me to put my clothes back on

33:30.458 --> 33:31.749
That was it, I am super fine

33:54.958 --> 34:00.832
Ask the howling wind, how long is the road

34:00.916 --> 34:05.832
Before I can see my dreams

34:06.583 --> 34:11.331
Will I survive the waves and the wilderness

34:11.333 --> 34:12.331
(Hiring Extras for Drowning Scene $400 per day)

34:12.333 --> 34:16.873
Before I make it with a smile

34:20.916 --> 34:26.081
The wind does not begin or end

34:26.541 --> 34:30.706
It just has to surge and go

34:32.125 --> 34:37.290
No questions asked

34:37.416 --> 34:42.331
No worries about the long journey
and wild waves

34:43.375 --> 34:48.623
Let's go with the wind

34:49.000 --> 34:54.331
No matter the seasons change

34:54.666 --> 34:59.832
Follow your dreams and don't hold back

34:59.958 --> 35:04.874
No matter how long it may take

35:17.125 --> 35:22.290
Follow your dreams and don't hold back

35:22.375 --> 35:27.540
Just like the howling winds

35:32.041 --> 35:32.874
Director

35:32.958 --> 35:34.540
Do I need to move?

35:34.625 --> 35:36.374
Have you ever seen a moving statue?

35:36.458 --> 35:38.332
No. Why don't you use actual statues?

35:38.416 --> 35:40.915
Because they're too expensive. Get lost!

35:43.416 --> 35:45.707
Dreamy, are there any acting tips
to be a statue?

35:46.625 --> 35:49.457
I see...just meditate to appear lifeless

35:49.541 --> 35:50.582
I'll try this

35:54.666 --> 35:56.165
Let's begin!

35:56.625 --> 36:00.124
The prince wakes up and
discovers that Snow White is a man

36:00.458 --> 36:03.374
Rolling

36:03.958 --> 36:05.249
Scene four. Shot one. Take one

36:06.416 --> 36:07.665
Action!

36:17.875 --> 36:18.957
Who are you?

36:20.375 --> 36:22.040
Snow White

36:22.708 --> 36:24.165
I slept with you?

36:29.333 --> 36:31.207
Cut!

36:31.541 --> 36:33.165
What are you doing?!

36:33.541 --> 36:35.332
It's only lust for you but love for me!

36:35.416 --> 36:36.749
Why so upset?

36:36.833 --> 36:37.665
What?

36:39.125 --> 36:41.707
Your character lie for chips...

36:41.791 --> 36:43.915
You no pain heart, understand?

36:44.291 --> 36:45.624
What?! But...

36:46.500 --> 36:48.457
Director, get someone to teach him English

36:48.750 --> 36:51.124
Come on. Let's do the close-up
of me killing him first

36:52.041 --> 36:53.999
Everybody, I no time, quickly, quickly!

36:54.416 --> 36:55.624
Mr. Marco, do you know your lines?

36:55.708 --> 36:57.207
Of course! Hurry up...

36:57.291 --> 36:58.249
Okay, ready!

36:58.541 --> 36:59.374
Action!

37:01.333 --> 37:02.082
What's the line?

37:02.291 --> 37:02.957
Cut!

37:03.750 --> 37:07.457
It's all my fault, blame it on my body,
you heartless man!

37:07.541 --> 37:08.249
Okay, let's begin

37:08.458 --> 37:09.332
Action!

37:09.666 --> 37:11.374
It's all...fault...

37:12.625 --> 37:13.790
Whose fault?

37:13.875 --> 37:14.624
Cut!

37:15.291 --> 37:19.374
It's all my fault, blame it on my body,
you heartless man!

37:19.625 --> 37:21.082
I got it! Again!

37:23.125 --> 37:25.290
It's all my fault...

37:26.208 --> 37:28.374
Blame it on my booby...

37:28.458 --> 37:29.332
Cut!

37:29.750 --> 37:32.207
Sorry Mr. Marco, it should be "body"

37:32.458 --> 37:33.415
Who cares!

37:34.125 --> 37:36.082
Just a bit off

37:36.500 --> 37:38.790
Kids watch movies during New Year...

37:38.875 --> 37:39.999
Better be careful with pronunciation

37:40.083 --> 37:41.624
Kids don't care about pronunciation!

37:41.708 --> 37:44.082
Shall we say "1 , 2, 3, 4, 5".
We can dub the lines later

37:44.291 --> 37:45.415
Counting numbers?

37:45.791 --> 37:46.624
Are you insulting me?

37:46.708 --> 37:48.207
No, this is easier

37:48.291 --> 37:50.499
Easier? Why didn't you say so!

37:50.583 --> 37:52.457
You wasted my time...you damn fool!

37:52.541 --> 37:53.790
Come on, shoot!

37:55.416 --> 37:56.374
Rolling

37:56.541 --> 37:57.332
Action!

37:58.416 --> 38:00.040
1 , 2, 3...

38:01.666 --> 38:02.707
Cut!

38:02.916 --> 38:05.499
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

38:05.583 --> 38:07.915
Don't interrupt! Shut up and shoot!

38:08.750 --> 38:11.165
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

38:11.250 --> 38:12.082
...8

38:12.833 --> 38:13.915
Cut!

38:14.333 --> 38:17.374
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

38:17.458 --> 38:18.749
Counting numbers make it more difficult!

38:18.833 --> 38:20.707
Tell me! Who on earth can do this?

38:21.958 --> 38:23.665
My Chinese's not good. Let's do it in English

38:23.916 --> 38:25.165
Okay. Rolling

38:26.291 --> 38:26.999
Action!

38:27.541 --> 38:30.999
Thousand wrong ten thousand wrong

38:31.083 --> 38:33.374
My meat wrong

38:33.958 --> 38:36.332
You negative...

38:36.958 --> 38:39.707
Heart people

38:53.333 --> 38:54.207
What's he doing?

38:59.250 --> 39:00.040
Cut!

39:00.958 --> 39:02.374
Mr. Marco. Are you okay?

39:03.958 --> 39:05.457
Can't you understand simple English?

39:05.750 --> 39:07.624
No, I don't...what happened actually

39:08.125 --> 39:09.749
Of course you won't understand...
but if you insist...

39:09.833 --> 39:10.624
I'll tell you

39:10.708 --> 39:11.415
Attention! Everyone attention!

39:11.500 --> 39:13.124
Mr. Marco is giving acting lessons.

39:13.208 --> 39:14.040
No photo! No touching!

39:14.041 --> 39:17.040
I killed my beloved with a knife

39:17.125 --> 39:19.665
My emotions are so complex!

39:19.750 --> 39:24.624
Sad, fearful, selfish, arrogant,
excited, shy...and so on

39:25.000 --> 39:26.165
Those emotions...

39:27.041 --> 39:29.540
They are just like...just like this...

39:29.625 --> 39:31.457
...and that...

39:31.958 --> 39:33.915
What do you know? And you interupted me?!

39:34.625 --> 39:37.040
So sorry. I thought you were having seizure

39:37.458 --> 39:38.624
Seizure?!

39:38.708 --> 39:41.374
My acting was amazing
but you thought I was possessed!

39:42.166 --> 39:44.957
Didn't you guys see it...my amazing acting?!

39:46.875 --> 39:47.707
What are you doing?!

39:47.791 --> 39:49.999
You fall asleep when I give lesson

39:50.083 --> 39:51.374
Sorry Mr. Marco

39:51.541 --> 39:52.707
It's you again!

39:54.291 --> 39:55.749
Come here!

39:56.041 --> 39:59.040
This statue doesn't look real...too clean

40:00.333 --> 40:02.999
I didn't sleep well last night.
I didn't mean to fall asleep

40:04.958 --> 40:06.290
Get down on the ground!

40:06.375 --> 40:07.332
Quickly!

40:07.666 --> 40:08.582
Right!

40:11.208 --> 40:13.374
Stay still!

40:13.458 --> 40:15.582
Way too clean...need retouching!

40:15.666 --> 40:16.832
You need to look more realistic!

40:17.125 --> 40:18.707
Dirts enhance texture

40:20.958 --> 40:23.415
It's way too clean

40:23.708 --> 40:25.540
Forget it...don't use this statue!

40:25.750 --> 40:26.707
Everyone...back to work!

40:26.791 --> 40:29.915
Hurry up!

40:42.625 --> 40:43.499
Hello

40:44.000 --> 40:46.082
How've you been? Alright?

40:46.750 --> 40:49.207
Pretty good, Mum. Everything's fine

40:49.458 --> 40:50.874
That's good

40:51.416 --> 40:55.165
Remember to be humble and learn from others

40:56.166 --> 40:59.374
I know...I get it

41:01.000 --> 41:05.790
Dad and I are worried that you're being bullied

41:10.375 --> 41:11.332
Don't worry

41:12.416 --> 41:15.415
Everyone likes me here...really

41:16.291 --> 41:17.624
That's good to know

41:18.791 --> 41:19.790
Oh, Mum...

41:21.041 --> 41:22.457
ls Dad still mad at me?

41:23.916 --> 41:24.832
No

41:30.791 --> 41:33.249
Your Dad got a headache and just resting now

41:34.250 --> 41:35.832
Please tell Dad that...

41:41.916 --> 41:43.415
I love you both

41:44.833 --> 41:45.707
What did you say?

41:45.791 --> 41:47.499
Say that again, louder

41:48.583 --> 41:50.165
Damn you! Get lost!

41:51.833 --> 41:53.707
This make-up room is for actors,
not for extras!

41:56.916 --> 41:57.874
Isn't she sweet?

41:58.250 --> 41:59.332
Damn you!

41:59.666 --> 42:00.540
What?

42:00.750 --> 42:01.790
Isn't that sweet?

42:04.000 --> 42:04.874
Dreamy

42:05.083 --> 42:06.290
Are you okay?

42:06.416 --> 42:07.249
Young...

42:07.958 --> 42:10.665
Please, stop asking me if I'm okay

42:10.875 --> 42:12.874
Your face...This is too much!

42:13.208 --> 42:15.665
Stop! Don't make things more difficult for me

42:15.750 --> 42:17.707
I need money and I need this job!

42:17.791 --> 42:19.832
Why didn't you say so? Money is all I have

42:19.916 --> 42:20.999
How much do you need? I can give it to you

42:21.083 --> 42:22.540
Stop joking around with me!

42:23.250 --> 42:24.624
You are just like them!

42:25.208 --> 42:26.415
Can't you see I've reached rock bottom?

42:26.500 --> 42:27.665
I just want to help

42:27.750 --> 42:30.540
If you really want to help...
just leave me alone!

42:37.708 --> 42:38.582
I am sorry

43:00.458 --> 43:04.874
Wish I could fly a rocket, fly you to the skies

43:04.958 --> 43:08.582
Live together in outer space

43:09.541 --> 43:13.707
Live for a thousand years
and be blissful everyday

43:13.791 --> 43:17.165
Having you by my side is endless fun

43:18.166 --> 43:22.707
Being together with you is my pride and joy

43:22.791 --> 43:26.499
Fear not of the end of the world

43:27.083 --> 43:31.332
When storm comes, as long as I see you

43:31.416 --> 43:34.832
It is like a thousand miles of sunshine

43:35.583 --> 43:39.832
Having you around is joyful
and make everything marvelous

43:39.916 --> 43:43.874
Even plain water taste sweet

43:44.333 --> 43:48.582
Longing to be with you forever,
I need you every minute

43:48.666 --> 43:52.457
You are sunlight. You are my breath

43:53.000 --> 43:57.457
Dressing up for you, feeling crazy for you

43:57.541 --> 44:01.249
Be a fool for you

44:01.833 --> 44:05.790
Scream like crazy is joyful too

44:05.875 --> 44:09.249
Having you by my side is endless fun

44:10.333 --> 44:14.665
If I lose you one day, blossoms would feel sad

44:14.750 --> 44:18.540
I would desert the world to live on an island

44:18.916 --> 44:23.165
Carve a figure of wood in the memory of you

44:23.250 --> 44:26.915
Live alone with the figure of you

44:27.333 --> 44:31.499
Having you around is joyful
and make everything marvelous

44:31.583 --> 44:35.165
Even plain water taste sweet

44:35.750 --> 44:39.999
Longing to be with you forever,
I need you every minute

44:40.083 --> 44:43.707
You are sunlight. You are my breath

44:52.250 --> 44:53.290
Cut

44:53.708 --> 44:55.957
Mr. Marco, this is the first shot
of the entire movie

44:56.041 --> 44:58.707
You ate a poisonous banana and
turned into a man

44:58.791 --> 45:01.082
I want you to show more deep inner fear

45:01.166 --> 45:02.832
Or this movie is doomed

45:02.916 --> 45:03.999
Not like this...

45:04.625 --> 45:05.915
I want true fear

45:07.500 --> 45:08.957
Show me

45:09.583 --> 45:11.624
Try expressing it with your eyes

45:11.833 --> 45:12.499
Cut

45:13.541 --> 45:14.707
What are you doing?

45:15.291 --> 45:16.165
Do it again

45:16.833 --> 45:18.499
Truly feel it...

45:18.583 --> 45:19.499
Cut!

45:20.375 --> 45:23.415
If you keep doing this...the movie's doomed!

45:24.625 --> 45:25.374
Do it again

45:25.458 --> 45:26.457
For example...it's really...

45:26.541 --> 45:30.124
Cut!

45:31.125 --> 45:32.374
Forget it. Take a break

45:32.750 --> 45:33.415
Well...

45:33.500 --> 45:34.749
Cut...

45:36.250 --> 45:37.207
Get lost!

45:49.833 --> 45:50.874
How did it feel?

45:52.125 --> 45:53.415
Unhappy?

45:53.500 --> 45:54.957
It's hard to say

45:56.208 --> 45:58.124
We're all just making a living here

45:58.208 --> 45:59.999
Let's not give each other a hard time

46:00.083 --> 46:01.540
Why so serious?

46:02.041 --> 46:02.915
PA

46:03.458 --> 46:05.249
Show him to the restroom,

46:05.916 --> 46:06.915
Clean him up

46:13.083 --> 46:14.040
Hello

46:18.666 --> 46:19.540
Mr. Marco

46:20.083 --> 46:21.207
Did you see the news?

46:21.291 --> 46:22.957
No, what's up. Quick!

46:23.041 --> 46:25.999
Do you remember the extra you were yelling at?

46:26.083 --> 46:27.249
Yeah?

46:28.625 --> 46:29.624
She's dead

46:31.041 --> 46:31.707
How did she die?

46:31.791 --> 46:33.040
She hung herself

46:33.125 --> 46:36.874
She wore a red dress to show her deep vengeance

46:47.625 --> 46:48.915
Look! What's she doing there?!

46:50.333 --> 46:51.374
I don't see anyone

46:51.750 --> 46:54.040
That person in red...standing by the wall

46:54.125 --> 46:55.124
Can't you see her?

46:56.916 --> 46:58.540
Mr. Marco, stop joking

47:05.333 --> 47:07.165
Get a close-up of him looking scared!

47:07.583 --> 47:08.415
Got it

47:10.041 --> 47:12.040
Director, why am I looking at the wall?

47:12.208 --> 47:13.749
It's not a wall. It's an ocean

47:13.833 --> 47:16.790
You're ice-skating and
you see your crush, Mr. Marco

47:16.958 --> 47:20.082
You dare not to look at him...
so you steal a glance

47:20.166 --> 47:22.082
Then hide behind the wall and
steal another glance. Got it?

47:22.500 --> 47:23.290
Got it

47:23.375 --> 47:24.249
Action!

47:45.708 --> 47:46.874
Now you gather your courage

47:46.958 --> 47:49.499
Give him your necklace and smile

47:49.791 --> 47:50.624
Action!

47:54.583 --> 47:56.957
This is for you...

48:00.916 --> 48:01.999
Great! Cut!

48:02.250 --> 48:04.415
Perfect! Beautiful!

48:04.791 --> 48:05.874
Director, this...

48:05.958 --> 48:07.832
He peed his pants...

48:07.916 --> 48:08.790
Never mind...hold on

48:08.875 --> 48:10.332
Sorry Mr. Marco. Please don't be angry

48:10.416 --> 48:11.790
That was the expression I needed

48:11.875 --> 48:13.999
That's awesome. Let's continue!

48:14.083 --> 48:14.999
I'm not doing it!

48:19.708 --> 48:21.040
I need to go to the hospital...

48:23.666 --> 48:24.832
Damn you!

48:25.625 --> 48:26.707
You will hear from my lawyer

48:26.791 --> 48:27.790
Sorry, Mr. Marco

48:27.875 --> 48:29.165
I just wanted a better performance

48:29.250 --> 48:31.290
You could've just told me how!

48:31.375 --> 48:33.624
I'm a world-class actor. I can do anything

48:33.708 --> 48:36.165
I kept asking and you kept failing

48:36.250 --> 48:39.332
So you came up with this evil plan?

48:39.833 --> 48:41.957
Attention! Attention everyone!
Mr. Marco pissed his pants!

48:42.041 --> 48:42.957
What did you just say?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.957
Attention everyone!
Mr. Marco did not piss his pants

48:46.041 --> 48:47.290
They're just wet

48:47.375 --> 48:49.249
I've had enough of you!

48:50.791 --> 48:52.499
I've been in the movie business for decades

48:52.583 --> 48:55.540
I've never been so humiliated in my life!

48:58.916 --> 49:00.374
How is it possible for an extra...

49:00.833 --> 49:03.207
to humiliate a world-renowned star?

49:03.541 --> 49:05.082
What the hell!

49:05.375 --> 49:06.915
It's total nonsense!

49:09.166 --> 49:10.374
How dare you stand there still?

49:10.458 --> 49:11.915
I am sorry

49:12.333 --> 49:13.374
No, you stay!

49:13.875 --> 49:14.915
You go!

49:18.916 --> 49:20.040
Yes. You should go!

49:20.125 --> 49:22.249
I meant you, Marco. Leave!

49:22.583 --> 49:24.415
You, young people these days...

49:24.916 --> 49:27.374
ls so inexperienced and come up with this crap

49:27.583 --> 49:29.207
I get it

49:29.666 --> 49:30.582
I totally understand

49:30.666 --> 49:34.332
I had to do this because your acting sucks

49:34.583 --> 49:36.665
My acting sucks? Why did you hire me
in the first place?!

49:36.750 --> 49:39.082
Because you were cheap and
everyone else was busy

49:39.166 --> 49:40.040
You've been a total has-been for years

49:40.125 --> 49:43.457
Thought you would have cherished this chance

49:43.541 --> 49:46.790
You're a failure because
you don't have what it takes to be an actor

49:46.875 --> 49:48.249
Let's not waste more time. Sun's coming up

49:48.333 --> 49:49.749
Everyone, get ready. Let's roll again

49:49.833 --> 49:51.957
One more time, everybody!

49:52.208 --> 49:53.915
Don't worry about it. We're replacing you!

49:55.416 --> 49:58.415
Don't be a prick. I'm trying to be nice here

49:58.791 --> 50:00.749
You're the prick here!

50:01.666 --> 50:02.540
We should talk

50:03.083 --> 50:05.999
Get back to work. Come on

50:06.708 --> 50:07.707
Director

50:08.916 --> 50:12.957
I appreciate the chance. I'm really gratefuI

50:13.375 --> 50:16.665
I think about repaying you even in my dreams

50:17.208 --> 50:19.165
How about giving back my script?

50:19.416 --> 50:22.332
Please don't do this!
I haven't worked for seven, eight years!

50:23.583 --> 50:26.457
I can't lose this job!
Please give me another chance!

50:26.875 --> 50:28.457
I'll give you half my acting fee

50:28.791 --> 50:29.665
Deal?

50:30.750 --> 50:31.582
Do me this favor

50:32.000 --> 50:32.707
I can't

50:32.791 --> 50:33.665
Please?!

50:33.750 --> 50:34.832
Take back the script from him

50:35.541 --> 50:36.457
Excuse me

50:40.541 --> 50:41.415
Please don't!

50:41.500 --> 50:42.415
Let go!

50:42.500 --> 50:45.249
- Give me some face, please...
- Let go!

50:45.333 --> 50:46.999
Let go!

50:56.333 --> 50:58.124
I'm so sorry

50:58.416 --> 50:59.540
I didn't mean to scare you

50:59.625 --> 51:00.707
Don't say a word!

51:01.000 --> 51:02.207
I didn't know it would turn out that way

51:02.291 --> 51:03.749
I don't need anyone's sympathy

51:08.083 --> 51:10.957
Coming here make me feel like fighting

51:11.041 --> 51:13.499
You weren't fighting...
you were just beating yourself up

51:20.000 --> 51:21.249
Marco!

51:21.666 --> 51:25.165
Haven't seen you for a while.
So you're still acting

51:25.333 --> 51:28.624
Hey, I'm taller than you.
You've got sagging skin

51:28.708 --> 51:30.374
Dad. Mum

51:30.541 --> 51:31.457
She's our daughter

51:31.541 --> 51:32.832
- Come
- What are you doing here?

51:32.958 --> 51:33.707
Let's take a selfie

51:33.708 --> 51:34.665
Please Stop!

51:34.708 --> 51:35.957
Don't worry...

51:36.458 --> 51:37.874
Come on, let's pose together!

51:38.416 --> 51:39.832
- What pose?
- Show me the 'heart' pose

51:39.916 --> 51:41.707
Come on...be a good boy

51:42.291 --> 51:45.165
Smile! One, two, three!

51:47.833 --> 51:50.499
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Marco

51:50.583 --> 51:51.499
Marco

51:51.583 --> 51:52.915
When my daughter was a kid...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.999
She saw your movie "Orphan Adventure" and
fell in love with acting

51:56.458 --> 51:58.582
You're her inspiration

51:58.666 --> 51:59.665
Mum, please stop

52:00.333 --> 52:01.874
Mr. Marco. Please don't mind us

52:02.000 --> 52:04.040
We're big fans of yours

52:09.333 --> 52:10.207
Mr. Marco

52:10.916 --> 52:12.957
My daughter won't listen to me

52:13.125 --> 52:14.957
But she's just not cut out for this

52:15.458 --> 52:17.249
Can you help me talk her out of it?

52:22.958 --> 52:23.874
She works very hard

52:25.958 --> 52:27.124
She'll make it

52:32.791 --> 52:34.540
Thank you Mr. Marco!

52:51.708 --> 52:52.582
Young!

52:54.208 --> 52:55.665
Nice suit!

52:55.750 --> 52:56.665
It's okay

52:57.083 --> 52:58.624
Whose fancy car?

53:00.125 --> 53:01.832
Dreamy...is $200,000 enough?

53:02.000 --> 53:03.374
I can give you more if you need it

53:03.458 --> 53:06.165
Stop messing around!
Using prop money will get you arrested

53:06.250 --> 53:07.124
Boss

53:07.416 --> 53:09.124
Time's up. We have to go

53:10.166 --> 53:12.249
In a minute...I'm almost done

53:13.666 --> 53:14.915
Dreamy, just take it

53:15.000 --> 53:15.957
No, I can't

53:16.041 --> 53:18.249
I found a part-time job. I have enough money

53:19.041 --> 53:19.874
That's good then

53:23.791 --> 53:25.415
So you're actually rich

53:26.125 --> 53:27.999
It's from my family business

53:28.083 --> 53:29.415
Why did you even become an extra?

53:29.500 --> 53:30.540
I really enjoy it

53:30.750 --> 53:32.707
But I need to go abroad for my family business

53:32.791 --> 53:33.749
I can't fool around anymore

53:33.833 --> 53:35.290
That's so amazing!

53:35.625 --> 53:37.040
Not really. I've got to go

53:37.833 --> 53:38.624
By the way...

53:39.041 --> 53:40.665
I want to tell you I like you

53:41.666 --> 53:42.874
Well, I like you too

53:43.291 --> 53:46.082
No, I mean in a romantic kind of way

53:48.125 --> 53:51.499
I thought of you as a friend...
but you wanted something more?

53:51.583 --> 53:52.582
Yes

53:56.833 --> 53:57.790
What do you like about me?

53:58.125 --> 53:59.249
You've got a beautiful soul

53:59.375 --> 54:01.915
So you're saying I'm ugly on the outside?

54:02.000 --> 54:03.832
No, you look beautiful too

54:03.916 --> 54:06.082
That's so fake! Imagination

54:06.166 --> 54:06.999
Come on. Try again with more feeling

54:07.083 --> 54:08.124
You're really good-looking!

54:08.208 --> 54:09.790
Just forget it

54:09.875 --> 54:12.457
I don't blame you.
The lines are a bit of a stretch

54:12.708 --> 54:13.457
Right!

54:14.500 --> 54:16.915
How dare you!

54:18.708 --> 54:19.874
I've got a boyfriend already

54:20.000 --> 54:20.915
I know

54:21.708 --> 54:23.040
But thank you anyways

54:23.208 --> 54:24.624
I'll be going then

54:24.708 --> 54:25.707
Come and visit me sometimes

54:25.791 --> 54:28.165
I'll be in America.
Might not be able to come back for a while

54:34.291 --> 54:36.665
You're a big-shot now! I'm so envious

54:37.041 --> 54:38.290
I should be the one that's envious

54:38.666 --> 54:40.332
You get to do what you love

54:41.041 --> 54:41.874
I'll be rooting for you

54:48.791 --> 54:49.749
Hello

54:50.250 --> 54:51.290
Your food's here

54:53.416 --> 54:55.999
Please give me a five-star rating. Thank you

55:02.416 --> 55:03.540
Mimi!

55:03.708 --> 55:04.707
Try it on

55:05.583 --> 55:07.290
It's been a while...how are you?

55:08.416 --> 55:09.290
You know her?

55:09.708 --> 55:10.540
Yes

55:11.750 --> 55:12.957
Director Chen!

55:15.000 --> 55:17.582
It's really you! What an honor to meet you!

55:18.166 --> 55:21.415
I'm a big fan of your movies. I love your work

55:21.958 --> 55:22.749
Thanks

55:23.250 --> 55:24.249
Try this one

55:26.208 --> 55:28.665
Actually, I'm an actor. My name's Dreamy

55:29.208 --> 55:32.207
Can you give me a chance to act in your movie?

55:32.583 --> 55:33.790
I'm willing to play any roles

55:33.916 --> 55:34.749
Sure

55:35.000 --> 55:35.874
Really?

55:36.791 --> 55:37.707
That's wonderful!

55:37.958 --> 55:39.749
If you give me a chance...

55:40.375 --> 55:42.915
I won't let you down!

55:43.500 --> 55:44.457
That's good

55:45.083 --> 55:45.915
Thank you!

55:48.416 --> 55:49.624
I'll get going

55:52.791 --> 55:53.624
Pardon me

55:53.958 --> 55:54.957
Director, please have a look at this

55:55.041 --> 55:58.665
Director, when will the movie start shooting?

55:58.750 --> 56:00.165
I want to clear my schedule for you...

56:01.250 --> 56:02.124
Do you know her well?

56:02.208 --> 56:02.999
Not really

56:04.041 --> 56:05.165
We'll call you

56:06.375 --> 56:07.582
You can go now, thank you

56:13.958 --> 56:15.040
I'm sorry, but...

56:15.333 --> 56:17.999
May I have your WeChat?
I can come anytime to audition

56:18.083 --> 56:21.082
We don't use WeChat. Why are you still here?

56:21.625 --> 56:22.582
Oh okay

56:23.125 --> 56:25.707
Can I borrow a pen? I'll just leave my number

56:25.791 --> 56:28.207
- The Director can reach me anytime
- Just go!

56:28.416 --> 56:29.374
Okay

56:31.291 --> 56:31.915
Thank you so much

56:31.916 --> 56:32.707
I won't be calling you

56:32.791 --> 56:33.624
Just go

56:34.375 --> 56:35.957
Thought you said you'll call me?

56:36.041 --> 56:36.874
Hold on!

56:41.916 --> 56:44.415
I was only being polite.
Didn't want to hurt your feelings

56:44.583 --> 56:46.165
Have you never looked in the mirror?

56:47.041 --> 56:48.082
I look at it everyday

56:48.375 --> 56:49.665
You actually think you have a chance?

56:50.416 --> 56:51.165
I do

56:51.250 --> 56:52.040
No, you don't!

56:54.333 --> 56:56.374
I know the chances are slim...

56:56.458 --> 56:57.332
but I'm willing to wait

56:57.416 --> 56:58.082
You don't need to wait!

56:58.166 --> 56:59.290
You'll never get a chance....ever!

57:00.875 --> 57:02.874
How long would 'ever' be?

57:04.041 --> 57:07.582
Till the end of the universe!

57:08.375 --> 57:09.249
Do you understand?

57:10.666 --> 57:12.749
Well...what about after the universe ends?

57:16.750 --> 57:21.290
People like that are a disgrace to humanity

57:21.916 --> 57:24.665
They'll never make it
but yet they're in denial!

57:25.583 --> 57:27.832
These people never know when to quit!

57:28.750 --> 57:31.790
We just want your food!
Aren't you here to deliver our meals?!

57:32.041 --> 57:33.624
Sorry Director,
Sorry everyone for the disruption

57:33.708 --> 57:34.915
I'll lead her out

57:35.791 --> 57:36.749
Let's go

57:45.458 --> 57:47.499
What are you doing?
You're making a fool of yourself!

57:48.166 --> 57:49.499
I had to try

57:49.583 --> 57:52.040
Forget about it. It's fate!

57:52.333 --> 57:53.790
Do you know what fate is?

57:53.875 --> 57:54.790
What is it?

57:54.875 --> 57:57.040
I never wanted to be a star, but here I am

57:57.125 --> 57:59.249
You've always wanted to be a star,
but you're only an extra

57:59.333 --> 58:00.749
This is fate!

58:01.208 --> 58:03.290
Don't fight it, okay?

58:08.125 --> 58:09.915
Charlie, where are you?

58:10.375 --> 58:11.832
I'm with a client

58:12.583 --> 58:14.207
I want to see you

58:14.375 --> 58:17.749
I still have a meeting later. I'm really busy!

58:17.833 --> 58:19.124
I'll call you later

58:20.958 --> 58:22.249
Wait, don't hang up

58:22.500 --> 58:23.415
What's up?

58:27.500 --> 58:28.957
What are you wearing today?

58:29.625 --> 58:31.707
I wear the same thing everyday

58:31.916 --> 58:33.249
White shirt and black pants

58:33.458 --> 58:34.665
Why are you asking?

58:35.500 --> 58:37.915
Oh nothing...just curious

58:38.000 --> 58:39.707
I'll talk to you soon. Bye bye

59:00.875 --> 59:02.082
Let's take a taxi

59:02.166 --> 59:02.790
Okay

59:02.875 --> 59:03.915
Where can we find taxi?

59:04.000 --> 59:04.999
Right over there

59:06.416 --> 59:07.457
It's raining hard

59:07.541 --> 59:09.207
Hi Cousin...what a coincidence!

59:09.875 --> 59:12.290
Darling, she's my cousin. Wait here

59:20.458 --> 59:21.290
Who's she?

59:21.708 --> 59:22.999
A client

59:24.041 --> 59:25.207
Why did you call me your cousin?

59:25.916 --> 59:28.415
Don't worry about it! It's just a label!

59:30.166 --> 59:31.124
Let me talk to her

59:34.083 --> 59:36.749
She's really my client and
you're my client too!

59:36.958 --> 59:39.624
I provide service...okay?

59:39.916 --> 59:40.915
What service?

59:41.291 --> 59:42.624
You know

59:43.750 --> 59:45.457
Boyfriend for hire

59:46.583 --> 59:47.540
You're an escort?

59:47.666 --> 59:50.624
Whatever...it's just a label

59:52.875 --> 59:54.415
Why me?

59:55.750 --> 59:56.999
ls this my fate?

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:05.165
Or because I'm stupid?

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:07.957
Don't be so hard on yourself

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:13.832
Ignorance is a bliss, makes you happier!

01:00:14.625 --> 01:00:15.374
Alright

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:17.749
Give me back my wedding fund

01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:19.665
About that money...

01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:22.624
I'll take good care of it. Don't worry

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.040
The money you are after...

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:31.207
It's all here

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:34.749
Take it. Just do whatever you want

01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:36.499
I'm not scamming you

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.790
I'm just collecting my service fee

01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:41.082
You can't just dine and dash, right?

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:48.165
You never thought
I would make it as an actor, right?

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:49.957
You'll make it

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:51.665
You're the best

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.040
As long as you pay me,
I'll keep telling you this...

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:55.040
As often as you want

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:01.999
Don't cry! She'll get suspicious!

01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:04.082
Stop it!

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:07.915
Don't give me any trouble!

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:09.249
Why did you do this?

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:12.957
Don't screw it up for me!

01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:20.749
Cousin! Don't take drugs!

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.790
It'll kill you!

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:25.082
Don't ask me for money anymore!

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:27.082
It's never too late to turn it around, Cousin!

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.624
You did the right thing

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:30.207
Don't lend her any money

01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:31.957
She'll use it to buy drugs!

01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:28.707
Are you okay?

01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:32.999
Did you fall asleep? Were you drunk?

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:35.832
Are you trying to kill yourself?

01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:38.707
Of course not

01:02:40.541 --> 01:02:42.874
Are you making a movie? Are you an actor?

01:02:45.291 --> 01:02:46.249
No

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.790
I'm not an actor

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:00.540
I'm awake now

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.874
Falling asleep while driving is very dangerous

01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:05.499
Don't do this again!

01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:18.457
Hello

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.415
Mr. Marco! Haven't seen you for a while

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.207
What's your role?

01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:23.165
A dying courageous soldier

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.790
Just lie down over there!

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:25.624
Quickly!

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.499
Costumes...make-up...get ready!

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.415
Over here right?

01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:31.832
Heads, stick closer!

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:36.040
It's getting dark, hurry up

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:39.332
Should I open my eyesor keep them closed?

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.457
Who cares!

01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:42.332
Then I'll die with open eyes

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:45.707
After all, this battle is
a glorious sacrifice to avenge the nation

01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:46.999
Dying with regret. I should...

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:47.957
Don't move!

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:52.707
Ready

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:53.874
Action!

01:03:55.166 --> 01:03:56.249
Protect the General!

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.624
Go!

01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:59.207
Quick

01:03:59.291 --> 01:04:00.415
I cover you

01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:01.540
Go!

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:11.040
Look at this! What the hell!

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:11.999
Where did you get that?

01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:13.249
Tencent WeeSee...

01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:15.707
Check this out

01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:19.749
So scared he peed his pants!

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:26.290
Marco is ridiculous!

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:32.124
Do you know Marco?

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:32.999
No, I don't

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.290
No

01:04:41.083 --> 01:04:42.207
He did wet his pants!

01:04:46.041 --> 01:04:47.540
I've watched this many times

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:49.749
Can't stop laughing everytime I watch this

01:04:53.666 --> 01:04:54.832
Didn't know he makes comedy

01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:56.124
This clip is hilarious

01:04:58.875 --> 01:04:59.999
Marco!

01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:01.040
Marco?

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:04.165
- Are you Marco?
- ls it really him?

01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:07.832
Looks like him

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:09.624
ls it real?

01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:15.249
- Yes, it's Marco!
- It's really Marco!

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:17.665
He looks better in person

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:18.540
Can you take a picture with me?

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:21.082
- I like you!
- Let's selfie

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:22.332
Look here

01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:24.040
Really?

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:25.832
No rush...

01:05:25.916 --> 01:05:27.624
No rush, let's do it together

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:30.207
Your clip was so funny! I love it so much!

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:33.124
(Record-breaking views: Marco is back!)

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:34.999
(Has-been child celebrity breaks
internet record with peeing video!)

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.665
(Wetting your pants to success!
Marco shocked over unexpected fame!)

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.915
(Brands fighting over new star -
Marco endorses baby nappies)

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:48.540
(Marco mad at Pee meme.
I'm not the God of Pee!)

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:53.457
Mr. Marco. We're so glad to have you today

01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:57.207
Can you tell us how you made your comeback?

01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.249
What 'comeback'?

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:01.124
You're red-hot once again

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.915
What red-hot once again?

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:04.165
I...

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:05.832
Was I dead and gone?

01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:07.832
I didn't mean it that way

01:06:07.916 --> 01:06:09.874
No, what did you mean by 'comeback'?

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:12.374
Are you trying to insult me?

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.124
That was really good!

01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:18.915
Of course!

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:21.832
Mr. Marco is absolutely brilliant,
emotions come out anytime!

01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:24.999
Sure, when my emotions explode, I can't stop it

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:28.082
Can you show us the 'peeing-the-pants' look?

01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:34.832
So many children will be watching...

01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:36.165
Let's not do that

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.790
You're right. Please tell us
what's next for you

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:42.207
What else? Just some international blockbuster

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:45.915
I've met Marco. This is the video of
me scaring him to pee himself

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:47.499
You're an actor too?

01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:49.582
Yes, I used to be an actor

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:51.332
Have you met Bruce Lee?

01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:51.957
Of course, I've met them all

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:52.832
Hey!

01:06:53.416 --> 01:06:56.290
Stop chatting! Get back to work!

01:06:57.208 --> 01:07:00.874
There were so many ups and downs for you.
Tell us how you feel

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:03.457
I feel so blessed

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:06.457
Not everyone can experience these ups and downs

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:11.915
I am grateful to the person
who scared me in the video

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.207
I wouldn't be here today without her

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:15.624
Who is she?

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.124
I don't know her name...but...

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:19.749
She's an actor

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:24.165
Dreamy!

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.999
Look who's here!

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.707
You look so good!

01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:31.665
Mr. Marco!

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:32.665
Mr. Marco

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.707
Dreamy! I found you finally!

01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:36.082
I came to thank you

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:39.040
She didn't do much. All she did was scare you

01:07:39.416 --> 01:07:41.290
My hair turned white
from the shock she brought me

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:42.665
I wouldn't thank her for that

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.374
Come sit down

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:45.040
Come...

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:46.415
It smells delicious

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.415
You're super popular now!

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.290
Thank you for your scary face!

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:51.540
You have an amazing daughter

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:52.249
You are so mean

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.207
She looks like her Dad

01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:54.082
No, like her Mum

01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:55.040
She looks like her Dad

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:56.749
She looks like both of you

01:07:58.333 --> 01:07:59.290
Also, I want to say congratulations!

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:02.249
You're shortlisted for Stephen Chow's movie

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.790
What?

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.290
You didn't know?

01:08:05.541 --> 01:08:08.374
They're casting
some new actors with real talent

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:09.707
I saw your name on the list

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:10.915
Where did you see it?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.332
Online

01:08:12.916 --> 01:08:14.999
It's tomorrow in Beijing. See, right here!

01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:18.207
- What happened to the internet?
- Sorry...

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:20.165
Anyways, I'm not going

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:21.999
Why not?

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:23.707
I have a new job now

01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:25.040
I don't want to be an actor anymore

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.082
Why?

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:28.207
I'm a waitress now

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:31.290
Also, I've opened an online shop and
making a decent living

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:32.790
Dad and Mum are very content

01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:35.790
Dreamy finally came to her senses. That's good!

01:08:35.791 --> 01:08:36.832
Brilliant

01:08:38.291 --> 01:08:39.832
Soup for Marco...

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:41.415
Very good

01:08:44.125 --> 01:08:45.082
What's the matter?

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:47.915
I'm not feeling okay

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.082
ls it menopause?

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.207
Nonsense! He's way too young!

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:52.665
ls it a heart attack?

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.915
- Quick, call for an ambulance!
- No need. I'm okay

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.165
- Does your family know?
- It's okay. I'm fine

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.082
I can't watch Dreamy waste her life
as a 'happy' waitress

01:08:58.166 --> 01:09:00.332
It's just not right

01:09:03.916 --> 01:09:05.124
Don't get me wrong

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:06.665
What I mean is...

01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:10.249
It's like an undefeatable boxer...

01:09:10.332 --> 01:09:12.457
Giving up before the match even starts

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:16.165
I didn't give up. I finally understood

01:09:16.625 --> 01:09:18.124
I don't fantasize about being a star anymore

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:19.749
You're giving up!

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.124
Mr. Marco

01:09:24.041 --> 01:09:25.374
It's been more than a decade already

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.999
I've been ridiculed and rejected every day

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.374
Nobody wants to see me act

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:36.124
I've never got a single moment of respect

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:38.040
I've had enough!

01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:39.457
Why?

01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:41.582
What do you mean by 'why'?

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.207
Why give up?

01:09:43.666 --> 01:09:45.165
I'm not giving up!

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.040
It's just...

01:09:46.875 --> 01:09:48.624
It's just that I'm not cut out for it!

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.707
Hard work doesn't always pay off!

01:09:52.416 --> 01:09:54.915
I told you so! But you insisted!

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.624
Let her be. She was bullied all the time

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.790
I know, I get it

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.290
I totally understand...

01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:05.832
I came all this way just to show my gratitude

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:07.999
Now, I've got to go

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.374
Leaving so soon?

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:11.290
Mr. Marco, stay for dinner!

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.540
Please stay!

01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:14.290
I thought that...

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:16.749
Not giving up...is what success is all about!

01:10:17.208 --> 01:10:18.749
You had taught me that

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:42.499
Maybe I should give it a try...

01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:44.374
I knew it! You just won't let it go!

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.624
You useless bum!

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:48.749
Then go!

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:49.874
Book her a ticket!

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:52.749
Train or plane?

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:54.082
- Plane!
- Plane

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.290
First class!

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:57.290
Get out of here!

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:01.915
I don't need that much, Dad

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:02.874
Take it!

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:06.207
You're a total bum!

01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:07.790
Got the tickets! Get going!

01:11:07.875 --> 01:11:08.457
First class right?

01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:09.332
Sure

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:12.624
Thank you Mum

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.165
Dad, you're the best!

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:17.832
Stupid kid! Don't ever come back!

01:11:17.916 --> 01:11:18.457
Alright

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:19.790
Don't forget your keys!

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:20.874
Got it!

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.874
(Acting and movement)

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:42.624
I'm a robot

01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:43.915
Ok, next

01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:47.499
Morning

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:55.999
I'm a growing mushroom

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:56.957
Next!

01:11:58.166 --> 01:11:59.165
Hurry up!

01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:00.499
Next!

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.290
(Emotional control)

Boss, don't...

01:14:16.041 --> 01:14:17.290
Aren't we supposed to be playing mahjong?

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:19.707
What are you doing? It hurts!

01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:20.874
Don't...

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:23.040

01:14:52.083 --> 01:14:53.165
A client

01:14:53.416 --> 01:14:54.665
Why did you call me your cousin?

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:57.707
Whatever! It's just a label!

01:14:58.375 --> 01:14:59.290
Let me talk to her

01:15:01.666 --> 01:15:04.624
She's really my client! You're my client too!

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:07.249
I provide service...Okay?

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:08.499
What service?

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:10.332
You know...that kind of service

You're an escort?!

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.957
Whatever! It's just a label!

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:21.749
Why me?

01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:23.957
Am I just stupid?

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.207
Don't be so hard on yourself

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:33.040
Ignorance is a bliss, makes you happier!

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:40.790
Take it. Just do whatever you want

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:45.040
I'm just collecting my service fee

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:46.915
And also...

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:49.624
You can't just dine and dash, right?

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:56.124
You never thought I would make it as an actor

01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:59.165
Sure, you can make it. You're the very best

01:15:59.916 --> 01:16:01.999
As long as you pay me,
I'll keep telling you this

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.749
As often as you wish

01:16:06.416 --> 01:16:08.707
Don't cry! She'll get suspicious!

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:17.207
Don't screw it up for me!

01:16:20.791 --> 01:16:24.374
Cousin, quit doing drugs!

01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:25.790
It'll kill you!

01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:29.082
Never too late to
turn your life around, Cousin!

01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:32.582
Thank you

01:16:33.708 --> 01:16:35.707
Why did you hit me?

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.082
I'm not the cousin!

01:16:37.666 --> 01:16:39.082
Sorry, I didn't mean to!

01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:43.915
Can you switch and play the victim?

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:45.290
Sure

01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:54.874
You're an escort?!

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.082
Whatever...it's just a label!

01:17:01.166 --> 01:17:03.290
Why are you an escort?

01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:04.790
Don't cry!

01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.665
She'll get suspicious!

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:17.124
You look like a retard.
How could you be an escort?

01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:21.832
Whatever you say, don't say I'm a retard!

01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:23.540
That's not true

01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:26.915
The truth hurts, right?

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:30.124
You must be seen as a retard since little

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.165
So now you scam people to prove yourself

01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:35.040
Bullshit! Everyone loves me since I'm a kid!

01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:36.665
They don't love you. They just pity you

01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:37.624
Shut up!

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:38.749
You shut up!

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.582
Someone like you...doesn't deserve love

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:42.499
I...

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:48.957
You lowlife!

01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:50.332
You retard!

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:51.499
I'm going to kill you!

01:17:55.708 --> 01:17:56.915
Why me again?!

01:17:57.958 --> 01:17:58.915
I'm so sorry!

01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:01.040
I really didn't mean to hurt you!

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:02.790
Alright! Enough! Next!

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.040
So sorry!

01:18:09.041 --> 01:18:09.957
Hey!

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.624
That way!

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:12.499
You made it to the next level!

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:45.290
(A year later)

01:18:56.041 --> 01:18:56.832
Hey, what are you doing?

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.124
We are looking for our daughter!

01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:00.499
Go to the police station! Not here

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:06.499
- That way please
- Thank you

01:19:07.666 --> 01:19:08.624
That way

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:18.374
This song brings out
all kinds of emotions for me

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:20.332
Trust everyone here feels the same way

01:19:20.416 --> 01:19:22.582

This actress is really 'one-of-a-kind'

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:38.207
to the end of the universe

01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:39.999
Just cut the crap!

01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:42.040
Life is...

01:21:42.666 --> 01:21:44.082
But a dream!

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:45.790
Dreamy!

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:59.040

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:22.874
It's alright

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:24.457
Hello, Dreamy!

01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:28.290
Thank you

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:31.540
I'm an actor too. Do you think I can make it?

01:23:31.791 --> 01:23:32.874
Do you really love acting?

01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:35.499
I was born to act. Will I make it?

01:23:36.083 --> 01:23:37.124
No, you won't

01:23:38.708 --> 01:23:41.332
Even to the end of the universe...not a chance!

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:42.415
Do you understand?

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:44.790
I get it

01:23:45.333 --> 01:23:46.790
So what are you going to do?

01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:50.790
I'll go back to be a farmer

01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:52.957
Of course not!

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:55.457
Don't let people tell you what to do

01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:57.249
Keep working hard

01:23:57.875 --> 01:23:59.124
