00:17.900 --> 00:19.500
Gentlemen...

00:19.500 --> 00:21.400
let's start the bidding.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.400
Look at these beautiful ladies.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.400
Gorgeous twins. They can be
your girlfriends for the day.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.900
Remember folks, all your money
goes to charity.

00:30.100 --> 00:30.900
10,000.

00:31.000 --> 00:31.900
(cheering)

00:31.900 --> 00:33.000
50,000.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.500
Whoa.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.699
(cheering)

00:35.700 --> 00:37.300
Stan, your tech company
just went public.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.350
60,000.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.600
100,000.

00:41.100 --> 00:41.900
Whoa.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.100
Going, going... Gone.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.400
(cheering and applause)

00:49.500 --> 00:51.100
Gorgeous twins

00:51.400 --> 00:54.400
for $100,000.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.400
Next

00:56.400 --> 00:58.100
we have the beautiful Rebecca.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.400
(cheering)

00:59.900 --> 01:00.700
Shall we start the bidding

01:00.700 --> 01:02.600
at 20,000.
20,000.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.400
25.
(murmuring)

01:06.300 --> 01:07.900
Guys, this is all
tax-deductible.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.100
40.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.800
45.
Whoa.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.700
C'mon, man, you already
got a stunner.

01:16.900 --> 01:17.900
60,000.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.900
(cheering and applause)

01:21.300 --> 01:22.199
She's all yours.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.800
$60,000.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.700
Sixty

01:24.700 --> 01:25.900
thousand dollars.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.700
(cheering)

01:27.850 --> 01:29.050
Come on, Katie.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.200
Ready for this? Wow.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.400
It's so nice

01:34.500 --> 01:36.700
of Peter to let you use
his bedroom.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.300
I just gave him a ton

01:40.400 --> 01:41.800
of money for his charity.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.300
He owes me.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.300
You want to get
those curtains, Rebecca?

01:50.300 --> 01:51.000
Why?

01:52.100 --> 01:53.600
It adds to the mystery.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.000
Okay.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.300
Sure.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.100
So should we have a drink?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.500
Why don't you help me
with my tie?

02:06.900 --> 02:07.600
Okay.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.000
Ooh.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.000
Just give me one minute.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.200
Where are you going?

02:43.300 --> 02:43.700
I...

02:43.700 --> 02:45.000
I have to get something.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.700
Just give me one minute.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.000
What do you say?

02:55.100 --> 02:57.100
Let's close the rest
of these curtains.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.500
Sorry for the wait.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.400
Oh, it's going to be worth it.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.400
Girls?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.600
I hope you didn't start
without me.

03:14.100 --> 03:18.700
This is gonna be worth every penny

03:19.200 --> 03:20.300
??

03:24.100 --> 03:25.600
what's this? chocolate sauce?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.600
ok, excellent

03:28.300 --> 03:29.400
(screams)

03:39.100 --> 03:40.900
I just left the room
a few minutes.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.800
I know how this looks.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.400
Why'd you leave the room?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
To take a Viagra.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.200
I dropped some major

03:52.400 --> 03:53.000
dough here.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.400
I wanted to get
my money's worth.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.000
Well, looks like
you're going have to stick

03:58.000 --> 03:59.100
with the tax deduction.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.500
Where'the other girl?

04:04.200 --> 04:05.600
There was another girl?

04:06.300 --> 04:08.600
I bought... two.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.300
You bought two. Officer.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.399
What?
Thank you, Mr. Kornspan.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.399
Get his horsepower,

04:20.500 --> 04:21.700
will you?
Yes, sir.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.000
Frank,

04:23.400 --> 04:26.000
What about an ID?
We found our victim's purse.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.400
Her name's Rebecca Roth.
She's 19.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.500
Good, Frank.
Tell me about this auction.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.300
Well, they're raising money
for underprivileged kids

04:32.400 --> 04:33.900
so they can go
to summer camp.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.700
It's called, uh,
Project Campfire.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.400
It's hosted by the homeowner,
Peter Kinkella.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.200
I want to know
who bid what for whom

04:41.200 --> 04:42.600
and how much they paid.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.800
This must have been
one kinky party.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.400
Don't know whether
she was blindfolded in fun...

05:50.700 --> 05:52.600
or in fear.
Either way

05:52.600 --> 05:53.400
I'll take that.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.499
She sustained

05:57.500 --> 06:00.100
several stab wounds
to the torso.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.500
Any defense wounds?

06:01.600 --> 06:03.100
Not that I can see.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.200
Looks like she's missing
a ring, though.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.300
Maybe a robbery.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.500
That would be odd
to target her

06:11.600 --> 06:12.800
with so much bling at the party

06:12.900 --> 06:13.900
other than hers.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.700
Stabbed with a letter opener.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.300
Look at that:
blood on the blade,

06:30.300 --> 06:32.400
but also looks like
blood on the handle.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.700
So our killer may have been
injured during the attack.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.000
Looks like our best bet.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.300
I'm going to take it to DNA.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.900
Hey, Ryan.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.400
Yeah.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.600
I found a long black hair.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Could be African American.

06:52.900 --> 06:53.800
Hmm.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.600
Well, Delko got
the prime assignmeas

06:59.600 --> 07:01.000
of interviewing the girls.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.000
This could make it easy for him.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, I got it.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.500
Ms. Watson,

07:17.500 --> 07:20.900
we found a long black hair
on our victim's body.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.600
Any idea how it might
have gotten there?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.000
I was in-in that bedroom
with her.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.100
And George.
He bid on both of us.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.300
It must have gotten on her then.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.400
Well, we found

07:31.700 --> 07:34.300
George half clothed
and Rebecca dead.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.800
How'd you fare so well?

07:36.700 --> 07:38.800
Well, when we met to discuss
the details of our date,

07:39.200 --> 07:41.400
George told us
that he wanted a three-way.

07:43.200 --> 07:43.400
And I

07:43.500 --> 07:46.500
went along at first,
looking for a graceful way out.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.700
You know, I started
to get undressed.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.400
George was having trouble...

07:51.800 --> 07:53.500
staying focused.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.600
That's when he went
for some medicinal courage?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.700
And then what?

07:57.700 --> 07:59.800
Then I told Rebecca I was getting out
of there

07:59.900 --> 08:02.200
and that she should too.
Why didn't she?

08:02.300 --> 08:05.100
She said she felt guilty because
he had spent a lot of money

08:05.300 --> 08:06.700
and that she
couldn't leave.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.600
How did the blindfold fit in?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.900
Rebecca was a little nervous

08:13.900 --> 08:15.400
and I thought
it might calm her down.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.900
You are so sexy.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.300
Close your eyes.
Trust me.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.600
So you just left her there,
blindfolded with George's tie.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.700
Rebecca made her choice.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.300
I don't care
how much money he donated.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.000
I wasn't going to sleep
with him.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
Did you notice if Rebecca was
wearing a ring when you left?

08:33.700 --> 08:35.000
honestly don't remember.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.500
That's a convenient time
for a memory lapse.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.400
It's the truth.

08:40.299 --> 08:41.299
I make it my
business to know

08:41.299 --> 08:42.700
the most beautiful
women in Miami.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.600
Blonde, Latino,
Greek, Asian.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.399
Something
for everyone.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.800
So what does the highest
bidder get for his money?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.000
Well, I paid $50,000
for my date with Sonya.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.600
I assure you, it's all
on the up-and-up.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.100
For yo date with Sonya.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.000
My guests receive an
evening of conversation

08:59.100 --> 09:00.700
with the women
they bid for.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.000
The details are worked out
between the two parties.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.600
Yes. Where were you
when this happened?

09:06.600 --> 09:07.200
With Sonya.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.300
We went upstairs to
the private terrace

09:10.400 --> 09:12.100
to enjoy an intimate lunch.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.200
Which was interrupted
by all this.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.400
Yes, sounds like
an inconvenience.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.200
I going to need a list
of your guests, please.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.100
I'll get it right now.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.300
Do that.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
Look at you.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.500
Can't wait to grow up.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.200
It's a miracle
I don't see more kids like you.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
All right, let's work our magic.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.400
You ready, Ryan?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.200
Oh, Alexx, I was born ready.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.600
I've got your image.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.300
Let me know
if the angle is right.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.200
This stitching technology
requires

09:54.300 --> 09:57.600
that there's a perpendicular photo
of each side of her finger.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.000
Next angle.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.200
Then your computer stitches them together

10:01.200 --> 10:03.100
in a
three-dimensional image.

10:03.100 --> 10:03.799
Yeah.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.499
It's basically
going to look like

10:04.500 --> 10:05.199
a black and white photo

10:05.200 --> 10:06.600
of the ring she wore.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.800
Getting a perpendicular image

10:09.800 --> 10:12.000
of all sides
of a decedent's finger

10:12.100 --> 10:14.300
is a lot harder than it looks.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.200
You got that, Ryan?

10:19.900 --> 10:20.600
Alexx, do me a favor:

10:20.700 --> 10:22.500
make the image
more perpendicular, please.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.000
You want come down here

10:26.100 --> 10:27.500
and try it from my end, honey?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
No, Alexx, you-you're
doing a wonderful job.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.100
All right, now.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.900
Now let's get the last side.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.300
Is that her
missing ring?

11:01.100 --> 11:02.600
Looks small. What size is it

11:02.700 --> 11:03.900
It's a 4-and-a-half.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.100
Got a lot of detail, though.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.300
This is basically what the ring
would look like.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.000
Great job.

11:11.100 --> 11:11.699
WOLFE:
Thank you.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.100
WOODS:
Hey, hey, hey!

11:13.100 --> 11:14.300
What about me?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.800
You're fabulous.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.300
Unfortunately, finding that ring
is going to be the hard part.

11:22.000 --> 11:22.800
We'll do what we do.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.600
Let's start with estate sales
and pawnshops.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.600
DUQUESNE:
Mr. Thornton, next time
you steal something,

11:36.600 --> 11:37.700
you might want
to find a pawnshop

11:37.800 --> 11:40.100
that's a little less cooperative
with the police.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.100
Last time I checked,
selling your own property

11:42.200 --> 11:43.900
to a pawnshop was
completely legal.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.200
I didn't steal anything.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.500
That ring's a little too small
to be yours, isn't it?

11:47.600 --> 11:49.600
I had it made
for my girlfriend.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
Rebecca Roth.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.800
Why were you
selling her ring?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.500
Becca broke up
with me this morning.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.900
I thought
we were getting married.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.300
She broke my heart.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.800
I can't keep the ring.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.500
I don't want to be engaged.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.300
I want to experience life.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.100
That was crap.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.300
Is that why you killed her?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.100
Becca's dead?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.600
Miss Roth was found murdered
at a party today.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.900
Was there any chance
you were there?

12:29.100 --> 12:30.800
No. After Becca broke up
with me,

12:30.800 --> 12:31.900
I followed her.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.700
She went to some
fancy party,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.400
but I never went inside.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.500
I got my proof right out front.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.800
Proof of what?

12:39.900 --> 12:41.500
She left me for another guy.

12:44.000 --> 12:44.499
Hey.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.600
(giggles)

12:51.200 --> 12:52.800
Is there any chance
you'd recognize that man

12:52.900 --> 12:54.100
if you saw him again?

12:54.200 --> 12:55.100
Yeah, I can do
better than that.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.300
I got a...
I got a picture of him.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.100
That creep stole
my girlfriend.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.800
I'm going to need to take
this phone with me.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.600
Where are you going?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.200
That creep's name is
Jake Berkeley.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.700
I'm going to find out
what he's up to.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.100
* *

13:41.800 --> 13:45.100
Hey, Ryan said there was blood
on the murder weapon's handle.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.800
Yeah, and it's different
from our victim,

13:46.800 --> 13:48.500
whose ood was
all over the blade.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.300
That sounds promising.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.700
Just waiting on CODIS.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Did you find out
what Jake was doing
with the victim today?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.400
I paged him;
let's see if he calls back.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.600
Oh, there we go.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
Ah, that's
what I'm talking abouin

14:01.000 --> 14:02.600
CODIS hit on the blood
on the handle.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.300
Peter Kinkella.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.800
That was our party host.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.400
Arrested for solicitation.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.600
Maybe the party was really
just a way to solicit legally.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.600
CAINE:
Mr. Kinkella, your charity
auctions women for money,

14:15.500 --> 14:18.400
and, yet, you were busted
for soliciting prostitution.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.400
It was a one-time thing.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.400
I learned my lesson.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.400
Ruined my life;
my wife left me, took my kids.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.200
You do see the irony of it,
though, don't you?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.400
My charity donates
thousands of dollars

14:31.400 --> 14:33.000
to underprivileged kids.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.800
I thought an auction with hot
women would bring in more money

14:35.800 --> 14:37.700
from our wealthy male
benefactors.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.000
What was your connection
to Rebecca Roth?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.900
I never met her
before today.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.600
Then how do you
explain your blood

14:43.700 --> 14:45.400
on the handle
of the murder weapon?

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
That's impossible.

14:46.900 --> 14:50.800
So you didn't use
your letter-opener
to stab Rebecca, then?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.500
My letter-opener...
I can explain.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.600
I cut myself this morning
opening my mail.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.900
I cut my hand;
it doesn't make
me a murderer.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.300
Well, it certainly doesn't
eliminate you either.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.600
It's my house, my letter-opener,
and my bedroom.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.500
You find any of that criminal,
I'm sure you'll let me know.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.800
That's what I do

15:32.540 --> 15:34.240
It isn't
what it seems.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.740
Yeah, well, you know what?

15:35.740 --> 15:36.940
It never is with you, Jake.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.940
I had to find out from ATF
that you had lateralled to MDPD?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.340
Well, I thought
you'd find out.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.240
Why'd you leave ATF?

15:45.240 --> 15:46.940
Because you guys blew
my cover.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.540
I couldn't do that anymore.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.240
Word is,
Rebecca's your girlfriend.

15:57.340 --> 15:58.440
She's just a kid,
Calleigh.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.640
Well, now she's a murder victim,
so if you have an explanation,

16:00.740 --> 16:02.840
you better bring it.

16:02.940 --> 16:05.540
We're building a case
against Peter Kinkella.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.740
I needed
someone on the inside.

16:06.840 --> 16:07.740
So you thought
it was a good idea

16:07.840 --> 16:09.640
to turn a young girl
into a CI?

16:09.640 --> 16:12.540
Rebecca Roth is no angel,
believe me.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.540
And I busted her
for meth possession, so...

16:14.540 --> 16:17.140
So you threatened a first-timer
with a stint in jail.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.640
All she was supposed to do
was get in,

16:18.740 --> 16:20.740
look for his stash
and see what she could find out.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.040
You had nothing
on this guy.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.140
Yes, I did.
You're wrong.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.540
Kinkella's dealing heroin
out of his clubs in Miami.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.940
He's got toe
worth millions.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.640
Well, if you're so sure,
why send in the girl?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.640
Because I couldn't get in,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.040
and they were auctioning off
beautiful girls.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.440
And you couldn't have found
a young police officer?

16:36.540 --> 16:38.440
Well, not unless
they let me use you.

16:42.340 --> 16:43.840
Calleigh, you know
how this works.

16:43.940 --> 16:45.840
You get one shot
at a guy like this.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.840
ll, it looks like you missed.

16:58.340 --> 17:00.940
Detective Tripp.
Checked into
Kinkella's background.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.940
If his wife left him,
it's not official.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.040
Only thing on record is
their marriage certificate.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.240
Do they have kids?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.140
Yeah, two boys,
elementary school.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.540
Okay, income.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.940
He does well.
No stockpiled cash.
Pays his taxes.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.839
All shy activity
seems recent.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.140
Wait a second.
What does he do with the money?

17:17.240 --> 17:18.540
I don't know.
I checked into his charity

17:18.640 --> 17:20.740
and there is not a damn thing
charitable about it.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.839
Okay, so it doesn't come back
nonprofit.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.240
Anything but.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.040
Has all the earmarks
of a shell corporation.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.240
I'll have to dig deeper to see
if he's taking the money.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.040
Was the account
offshore, Frank?

17:32.340 --> 17:33.640
Yeah, Bahamas.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.340
So... what next?

17:36.440 --> 17:38.040
Let's go shake his tree.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.940
Lieutenant Caine.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.940
This certainly is
a beautiful home, Mr. Kinkella.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.940
How did you pay for it?

17:59.940 --> 18:01.540
If you've got financial
questions, see my accountant.

18:01.640 --> 18:05.640
I have a lot more than
financial questions for you.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.339
(dog barking)
What's the dog for?

18:07.340 --> 18:08.440
It's a drug-sniffing dog.

18:08.540 --> 18:11.040
I have a warrant to search
your premises.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.640
You can't just barge
into my home.

18:13.740 --> 18:16.040
I can when it's a crime scene.

18:16.040 --> 18:16.840
Excuse me.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.340
Let me see that.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.040
(barks)

18:42.640 --> 18:45.040
Let's see what we have.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.640
There's nothing here,
just some papers.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.140
If there were drugs here,
somebody moved them.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.540
Maybe he was reacting
to a residue.

18:57.540 --> 18:59.140
Hey, here we go.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.040
You got something?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.640
Yeah, a listening device.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
Now to remove it

19:05.640 --> 19:07.640
without compromising the potential for prints.

19:07.740 --> 19:08.140
Is that the stuff

19:08.240 --> 19:10.340
that preserves the sticky side
of the tape?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.140
That's right.
It contains heptane.

19:13.340 --> 19:14.640
You spray it in a mist.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.640
It negates the adhesive bond
long enough to remove the device

19:20.140 --> 19:22.740
and preserve
the potential for prints.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.040
Yeah, that's a short-range
transmitter.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.340
It's got a signal strength
of about a hundred yards.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.040
Who do you think put it there?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.940
Do you have something
to tell me, Jake?

19:37.940 --> 19:41.240
I don't have to tell you
everything about my cases.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.540
No you don't,
but, my friend,

19:43.640 --> 19:46.540
you just put a young girl in
harm's way and she got killed.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.840
What do you want from me, man?

19:50.840 --> 19:53.640
I want the recordings
from Kinkella's house.

19:53.740 --> 19:54.539
What recordings?

19:54.540 --> 19:55.940
The recordings
from the microphone

19:55.940 --> 19:57.540
that you had
Rebecca plant--

19:57.840 --> 19:58.940
those recordings.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.940
Look, I never gave her any mike.

20:00.940 --> 20:03.340
We found the mike, Jake;
it's standard-issue.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.640
I know you think that
I got that girl kied.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.740
But all I was doing was having
her gather information,

20:08.840 --> 20:10.140
strictly eyes and ears.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.240
Jake, if your fingerprints
are on that microphone,

20:13.440 --> 20:14.740
you're finished.

20:14.740 --> 20:15.840
You understand?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.240
Fine.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.940
(chuckles)

20:24.040 --> 20:25.840
Someone wasn't careful.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.040
Whoever planted this microphone

20:29.140 --> 20:30.640
touched the adhesive
on the back.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.340
Okay, then
this should be easy.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.140
Yeah, should be.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.540
Except, it's not his.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.640
Try running it through AFIS.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.540
Who else would want to bug
Kinkella's house?

21:02.440 --> 21:04.240
Apparently someone who doesn't
want us to know.

21:05.840 --> 21:06.740
It's restricted.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.540
You think it was a Fed?

21:09.540 --> 21:10.440
Or intelligence.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.340
Maybe Horatio can get clearance.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.740
Who are we missing here?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.140
I mean, who else was
in that room?

21:16.440 --> 21:19.240
Look, Heff Jr. doesn't seem
like the spy type.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.240
Well, what about your friend?

21:20.340 --> 21:22.940
The girl you interrogated?
Katie Watson?

21:24.240 --> 21:25.540
You think she's one of us?

21:25.640 --> 21:27.440
Why don't you ask her?

21:27.540 --> 21:29.440
<i>You interrupted
my spa treatment for this?</i>

21:30.540 --> 21:32.040
How many times
do I have to tell you:

21:32.240 --> 21:34.840
I left girlie in the room.

21:35.140 --> 21:39.140
It turns out that you left
something else there, too.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.140
What is that?

21:46.140 --> 21:47.740
Cut the act,
Ms. Watson.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.440
If that's even your real name.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.340
Yes, who do you work for?

22:00.540 --> 22:03.240
Let's just say I do my best
to keep you safe at home.

22:03.340 --> 22:07.340
Mm, so you're claiming
the Homeland Security Agency.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.840
DELKO:
So posing as
a girlfriend

22:08.940 --> 22:09.940
was just a cover?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.640
I do whatever the job requires.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.340
Was Rebecca involved
in the job?

22:14.340 --> 22:15.140
No, she wasn't.

22:15.540 --> 22:16.440
I never even saw her

22:16.540 --> 22:18.540
before that creep
bought us both in the auction.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.340
That's why I had to improvise
once we got to the room.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.940
Improvise by killing her?

22:23.540 --> 22:24.740
No.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.940
I blindfolded her, so she
wouldn't see me plant the bug.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.040
You want to
have some fun?

22:33.040 --> 22:34.640
I guess.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.340
Close your eyes.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.040
(chuckles)

22:40.840 --> 22:43.340
Okay, now get
comfortable, darling.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.140
Yes.

22:45.540 --> 22:48.640
You... are so sexy.

22:51.940 --> 22:55.240
I mean, just hot.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.540
Then I got out of there.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.340
What is your interest
in Kinkella?

23:05.240 --> 23:07.040
That's a need-to-know.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.340
I need to know.

23:08.840 --> 23:09.940
I can't help you.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.240
Well, what about Rebecca?

23:12.240 --> 23:13.540
Can you help her?

23:14.040 --> 23:15.840
I don't follow.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.740
Your microphone
recorded her murder.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.240
Let me see what I can do.

23:25.340 --> 23:26.540
I'll call it in.

23:26.940 --> 23:28.540
Don't make me wait.

23:35.340 --> 23:35.939
REBECCA:
Where you going?

23:35.940 --> 23:36.639
GEORGE:
Give me one minute.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.440
I got to get something.

23:37.540 --> 23:40.640
Okay, that's George
leaving for the Viagra

23:40.640 --> 23:41.740
KATIE:
You want to have some fun?

23:42.140 --> 23:43.840
REBECCA:
I guess.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.640
KATIE:
Close your eyes.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.840
Eric, jump ahead to
when Katie leaves.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.940
(recording fast-forwarding)

23:52.340 --> 23:53.240
She's out.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.040
(door opening)

23:55.040 --> 23:56.940
REBECCA:
George?

23:56.940 --> 23:58.440
Someone just walked in.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.240
Why don't we

23:59.340 --> 24:02.140
invite that other guy
to join us-- Peter?

24:02.240 --> 24:02.839
You ow, 'cause he was
kind of cute.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.340
(clattering)

24:04.340 --> 24:07.940
(Rebecca screaming)

24:07.940 --> 24:09.240
Oh, my G...

24:09.440 --> 24:10.240
(Rebecca gasping)

24:13.040 --> 24:16.240
(Rebecca gasping)

24:21.240 --> 24:24.440
I never heard
hesomeone die before.

24:24.540 --> 24:25.840
(clattering)

24:26.540 --> 24:28.540
GEORGE:
You're awfully quiet, ladies.

24:28.540 --> 24:29.440
That''s George.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.840
you start without me?

24:30.840 --> 24:34.040
This is gonna be
worth every penny.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.040
There's one leg.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.040
What's this, chocolate sauce?

24:38.040 --> 24:38.839
Excellent.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.140
What the...?

24:40.240 --> 24:42.540
(George screaming)

24:42.540 --> 24:44.840
S-Somebody...!
Something happened!

24:44.940 --> 24:46.540
Help! Help!

24:45.640 --> 24:46.440
PETER:
George, what did you do?!

24:46.540 --> 24:48.040
That's Kinkella
in the room.

24:48.140 --> 24:49.340
GEORGE:
You got to help me!

24:49.440 --> 24:51.240
PETER:
I'll go get you a towel.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.840
(dull clattering)

24:53.840 --> 24:55.740
Eric, rewind
that part.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.740
(recording rewinding)

24:56.840 --> 24:59.840
(dull clattering)

24:59.840 --> 25:02.740
It sounds like he took something
and left, doesn't it?

25:02.840 --> 25:03.240
(recording rewinding)

25:03.340 --> 25:04.340
(dull clattering)

25:05.040 --> 25:06.040
Yeah.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.440
Yeah, the dog went crazy,
barking near the bedside table.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.940
Something was removed.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.540
MAN:
911. What is your emergency?

25:13.140 --> 25:16.840
Let's find out Eric, what the real emergency was.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.540
Where's Lieutenant Caine?

25:42.540 --> 25:45.440
Mr. Kinkella,
you left out a smalletail.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.740
You were the first one
to find George.

25:48.740 --> 25:50.040
Uh, yeah.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.640
He started
screaming.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.340
At first, I thought he
was having a good time.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.340
But then I knew
there was trouble.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.640
And you decided to help him
by gng to get a towel?

26:00.540 --> 26:01.740
Right.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.240
Only, you never
got George a towel.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.540
You took something
from the room.

26:05.540 --> 26:07.740
Something heavy,
like a case.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.240
How do you know about that?

26:10.140 --> 26:12.740
The drug dogs smelled it, Peter.

26:12.740 --> 26:14.440
But I took the
drugs out...

26:18.840 --> 26:21.040
Dogs have an amazing
sense of smell.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.340
What kind of drugs

26:24.940 --> 26:25.940
Heroin.

26:27.340 --> 26:28.340
Uncut.

26:30.140 --> 26:31.540
In my book safe.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.040
Somebody! Help!

26:34.040 --> 26:35.140
George.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.040
George, what did you do?!

26:37.140 --> 26:38.540
You got to help me.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.540
I'll, uh...

26:41.540 --> 26:43.540
I'll go get you a towel.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.140
It was right
nexto the bed.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.640
I couldn't let??

26:52.640 --> 26:54.040
You're quite an investor.

26:55.340 --> 26:56.340
Pandering,

26:56.940 --> 26:58.340
drug dealing,
money laundering.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.840
Wasn't always that way.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.340
It seems to have started
in the last few months.

27:04.340 --> 27:05.540
Common denominator though

27:05.640 --> 27:08.740
is that you need
to make money fast.

27:08.740 --> 27:09.840
Why is that?

27:13.240 --> 27:16.240
Peter, murder is gonna

27:16.240 --> 27:18.640
round out the rest of
these charges really nicely.

27:19.640 --> 27:20.240
But I-I didn't...

27:20.340 --> 27:21.740
I want that safe.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.039
It's in the trunk of my car.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.640
Good.

27:27.740 --> 27:31.340
Let's go.

27:31.340 --> 27:32.640
(sighs)

27:38.540 --> 27:41.040
WOLFE:
Hey, man, what'd we get?

27:41.040 --> 27:42.740
It's what the
dope dog hit on.

27:42.740 --> 27:44.340
It's a dictionary.

27:44.340 --> 27:45.540
No, it's not.

27:46.740 --> 27:48.240
It's a book safe.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.440
It w concealing
his drugs.

27:49.540 --> 27:50.740
Doesn't look like
it could hold very much,

27:50.840 --> 27:52.440
besides a personal stash.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.640
He kept pure heroin in there.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.140
Cut it up, in the street,
it's wortx
a million dollars.

27:57.140 --> 27:59.740
So he kept it close to him,
and it was near the body.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.940
Yeah. And I'd say it was
at the killer's feet.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.440
Spatter.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.440
What is that, plastic?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.340
Looks like an aglet.

28:17.340 --> 28:19.940
The covering of a tip
of a shoelace?

28:20.040 --> 28:21.640
That's right.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.740
Some light-colored
threads inside.

28:26.940 --> 28:29.440
The frayed aglet must have
got stuck in wet blood.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.140
(Rebecca groaning)

28:32.440 --> 28:34.740
(groaning)

28:38.340 --> 28:40.840
Light-colored threads
means light-colored shoelace.

28:41.140 --> 28:43.840
Means that our killer
was wearing tennis shoes

28:43.940 --> 28:45.640
at a formal party.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.140
So we're looking
for the one person

28:47.240 --> 28:49.340
who didn't dress to impress.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.340
What are you doing?

28:59.440 --> 29:00.840
I'm seizing it.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.240
It's evidence.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.340
You see the frayed aglet

29:05.340 --> 29:06.440
from your shoelace?

29:06.740 --> 29:07.540
WOLFE:
We found the other half

29:07.640 --> 29:09.140
at Rebecca's murder scene.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.440
You said you never
went in the house.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.940
WOLFE:
Yet, somehow,

29:12.440 --> 29:15.440
the tip of your shoelace
got stuck in her wet blood.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.440
Sort of hard to explain,
don't you think?

29:19.440 --> 29:20.740
Why'd you do it?

29:23.540 --> 29:26.940
Wasn't bad enough that she left
me for the guy I saw her with.

29:31.940 --> 29:33.340
(giggling)

29:37.940 --> 29:39.040
(camera clicks)

29:45.340 --> 29:46.140
Be right back.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.740
KATIE:
Close your eyes.
Trust me.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.140
George?

30:00.140 --> 30:02.640
Why don't we invite

30:02.640 --> 30:04.840
that Peter guy to join us?

30:05.640 --> 30:07.140
You know, he's kind of cute.

30:09.540 --> 30:10.454
,500
George?

30:12.740 --> 30:13.840
(grunting)

30:13.840 --> 30:15.240
(screaming)

30:21.440 --> 30:23.940
She was selling herself
like a common whore.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.140
I couldn't
believe my eyes.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.640
We're from Virginia.

30:28.140 --> 30:30.640
We met in church, if
you can believe that.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.340
We made promises
to each other.

30:34.340 --> 30:37.240
And once she moved to South
Beach, she forgot everything.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.740
How so?

30:39.440 --> 30:41.040
She made new friends.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.540
Didn't come home
for days.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.540
I found drugs
in her purse.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.140
Then that guy...

30:50.140 --> 30:51.840
Rebecca didn't leave you
for that guy.

30:51.940 --> 30:53.140
He's a cop.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.840
She was helping him
to work a case.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.240
What?

30:59.140 --> 31:00.040
I don't get it.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.240
That's right; you don't.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.040
Maybe she would have
explained it to you.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.240
But you never
gave her the chance.

31:06.940 --> 31:10.540
You took her life.
Now we're gonna take yours.

31:16.340 --> 31:18.540
Peter Kinkella has been
laundering money

31:18.540 --> 31:20.040
and selling drugs,
and yet you're not

31:20.040 --> 31:21.540
focused on him. Why not?

31:21.740 --> 31:23.640
We need to keep
his operation going.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.240
So the monitoring device
is for someone bigger.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.340
Kinkella's only raising capital.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.840
We want who's
getting that money.

31:30.940 --> 31:32.140
Which is for who?

31:32.740 --> 31:34.140
I'm afraidhat's classified.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.140
Yeah.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.640
Classified. For now.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.640
<i>CAINE:
Richard Kinkella,</i>

31:40.640 --> 31:42.740
are you aware that
Homeland Security Agency

31:42.840 --> 31:44.240
is looking into you?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.240
Why?

31:47.840 --> 31:50.040
Because your money is being used

31:50.140 --> 31:53.140
to fund a terrorist
organization, that's why.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.740
I would never
help terrorists.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.040
Not intentionally.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.440
Up until six months ago,

31:58.540 --> 32:01.740
you were a legitimate
businessman with a family.

32:01.740 --> 32:02.740
So?

32:02.740 --> 32:04.540
You're still married,

32:04.540 --> 32:06.740
but no one has seen
your family recently.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.940
Where are they?

32:08.540 --> 32:10.340
Dead, if you
keep this up.

32:11.440 --> 32:12.440
Please, I
beg of you.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.540
You can't help me.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.640
I think I can.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.540
I drained
my accounts.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.440
Borrowed against
my business.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.640
Every time, they promised
it would be enough.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.240
But it never was.

32:26.240 --> 32:26.940
Three weeks ago,

32:27.040 --> 32:28.940
my wife was driving
my sons to school.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.940
They... took them.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.940
everything they
asked after that.

32:45.940 --> 32:47.440
I need names.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.640
I want to tell you.

32:49.940 --> 32:51.640
I do.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.240
But if anything
happenedo them...

32:53.240 --> 32:55.440
Mr. Kinkella, help me,

32:55.440 --> 32:58.840
so I can help your family, okay?

33:01.740 --> 33:03.540
No, I-I can't.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.340
Thought you didn't need my help?

33:10.440 --> 33:11.240
I would take help

33:11.240 --> 33:13.640
from anybody right
now, Jake, even you.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.640
So what's going on?

33:16.340 --> 33:17.540
You were running
surveillance

33:17.540 --> 33:19.040
on Kinkella, weren't you?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.640
Shadowed him 24/7.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.740
Only place I
couldn't get to him

33:21.740 --> 33:23.240
was inside his house.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
Why the photos?

33:25.140 --> 33:26.740
His family was kidnapped.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.440
Kidnapped for what?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.040
Money.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.440
Kinkella was being blackmailed into
funding a terrorist cell.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.140
My God.
Yeah.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.440
I was thinking maybe
your camera might've

33:35.440 --> 33:37.040
caught one of
the kidnappers.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.540
Thesguys ran Peter's clubs.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.640
Now that's his cutter.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.440
He prepared the roin
for the dealers.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.040
What about this
girl? Who's she?

33:59.640 --> 34:00.940
She's unidentified.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.940
She was with Peter at the party.

34:04.040 --> 34:04.940
Really?

34:04.940 --> 34:07.440
Yeah, she s pretending
to be his girlfriend.

34:07.740 --> 34:08.940
Well, she's giving him hell.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.840
I wouldn't take that
from somebody I paid for.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.639
Good to know.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.540
We've got to find her.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.139
I want in.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.340
I thought I wasn't any fun.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.239
Maybe I feel bad

34:19.340 --> 34:21.040
because I got Rebecca
in the middle of this.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
Maybe you just feel bad

34:22.139 --> 34:23.840
'cause you're not in
the middle of it.

34:23.940 --> 34:25.340
I'm sorry, Jake, I can't.

34:29.340 --> 34:30.239
CAINE:
Ms. Moreta,

34:30.239 --> 34:31.239
you led us to believe

34:31.340 --> 34:33.639
that you were purchased
at an auction,

34:33.639 --> 34:35.639
when, in reality,
the money went to you.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.239
You needed Peter's
full cooperation.

34:38.940 --> 34:40.639
So you kidnapped his family

34:40.639 --> 34:42.540
to fund your terrorist cell.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.239
That's crazy.
Is it?

34:47.739 --> 34:49.840
What's the plan, Ms. Moreta?

34:58.940 --> 35:02.640
My plan is to just sit back,

35:02.640 --> 35:04.740
relax, and watch

35:04.840 --> 35:07.440
as the world we know
changes forever.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.940
And how is
that gonna happen?

35:14.040 --> 35:16.840
My world believes in
the death of America.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.240
Your world.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.940
What is your world
planning to do?

35:26.340 --> 35:28.440
It's already in motion.

35:29.140 --> 35:31.440
I wouldn't stop it
even if I could.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.440
I believe you.

35:39.140 --> 35:39.740
Yeah, we don't know what

35:39.840 --> 35:41.940
they're going to hit or when.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.240
Okay, here what we do:

35:43.340 --> 35:45.740
we look into Kinkella's
last six months.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.340
As far as we know, he's
an unwitting facilitator.

35:48.340 --> 35:48.740
And he lawyered up.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.540
So what about Sonya?

35:50.640 --> 35:51.840
She pulls the strings

35:51.840 --> 35:54.140
and there's a reason
she chose him.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.140
Yeah, his resources.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.340
He must know
someone who is

35:57.440 --> 36:00.240
helping Sonya's group transport
whatever they're using.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.340
Someone important.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.240
Yes, like the man at the auction.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.340
CALLEIGH:
What've you got, Frank?

36:17.340 --> 36:19.540
A lot of bigwigs at
that auction: old money,

36:19.640 --> 36:21.540
new money, tech money.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.140
Anybody out of place?

36:23.140 --> 36:26.140
Yeah. George Kornspan.

36:28.340 --> 36:29.940
The guy who bought
our three-way?

36:30.140 --> 36:32.540
Mm-hmm, he's a stevedore
at the Miami port.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.840
Works with shipping containers.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.640
Well, 20 bucks says

36:35.740 --> 36:38.040
he has something to do
with which ones get inspected.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.040
(ship horn blows)

36:55.740 --> 36:57.440
Hands where I can
see them, Kornspan.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.740
I didn't come this far
to be taken down.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.440
Don't make a mistake
that'll cost you your life;

37:04.540 --> 37:05.640
put the gun down.

37:08.440 --> 37:09.640
BERKELEY:
Freeze.

37:14.140 --> 37:15.540
(gunfire)

37:18.240 --> 37:21.140
Calleigh!
Calleigh!

37:24.340 --> 37:27.040
Calleigh! Calleigh!

37:27.040 --> 37:27.740
Calleigh!

37:36.040 --> 37:37.540
Are you okay?

37:41.840 --> 37:43.940
Thank God for Kevlar.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.340
I will deal with you later.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.540
Are you okay?

37:53.540 --> 37:55.040
I'll be fine.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.140
Jake, huh?
Yeah.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.640
Dang... well,

37:59.740 --> 38:01.740
I brought you the new gadget
from Homeland Security.

38:01.740 --> 38:04.240
Oh, great. It's a portable
explosive detector.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.940
It detects in
parts per trillion.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.340
This was the lt
shipping container

38:07.340 --> 38:09.240
that Kornspan signed off on.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.240
Let's see.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.340
This should tell us
what was in it.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.240
(machine beeps)

38:31.840 --> 38:33.740
That's reading PETN.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.740
That's plastique explosive.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.740
This container could hold
about 10,000 pounds.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.340
That's twice as much
as they used

38:41.340 --> 38:43.140
in the Oklahoma City bombing.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.540
So why not just
blow up the port?

38:45.540 --> 38:46.840
I don't know.
I guess sometimes it takes

38:46.940 --> 38:49.940
an even larger explosion
to create a larger disaster.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.140
How're we going to find out
where they're going?

38:54.340 --> 38:55.440
WOLFE:
Found it. Thanks.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.840
Homeland Security.
What are they looking for?
The same thing we are.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.540
A vehicle carrying 10,000 pounds

38:59.640 --> 39:01.240
of plastique explosives.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.340
A mobile bomb.

39:04.340 --> 39:07.240
The contents were unloaded at the dock
than half an hour ago.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.740
(computer beeping)
Well, factoring in the size

39:09.740 --> 39:11.040
of a vehicle
necessary to carry

39:11.140 --> 39:12.440
that much weight
and the dr...

39:13.540 --> 39:16.040
This should give us a viable
radius of the truck's location.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.840
Route 821.

39:25.540 --> 39:27.240
They've got to be headed
somewhere big, huh?

39:28.340 --> 39:30.040
Where's that lead?

39:36.440 --> 39:37.640
That's Turkey Point.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.040
It's a suicide mission.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.540
They're going to blow up
a nuclear power plant.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.240
And cover Miami in 30,000 pounds

39:42.340 --> 39:43.840
of nuclear fallout.

39:44.140 --> 39:47.440
H... they're headed
to Turkey Point.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.140
(speaking foreign language)

40:06.740 --> 40:08.540
??Set up a roadblock
at Turkey Point

40:08.640 --> 40:11.140
and notify Homeland Security
immediately.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.340
AGENT (over radio):
Spotted vehicle
fitting criteria on 281.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.440
Red cab, 18-wheeler...

40:22.840 --> 40:24.640
The roadblock is in place.

40:24.740 --> 40:27.040
Standing by for authorization
to engage.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.840
Subject's vehicle
is one mile out.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.740
We've got it in our sight.

40:42.540 --> 40:43.640
Permission to engage.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.740
We have the green
light to fire.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.740
(speaking foreign language)

41:10.840 --> 41:12.040
(gunshot)

41:12.040 --> 41:14.340
(explosion)

41:34.140 --> 41:36.640
I cannot believe
I took a bullet for you.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.140
What are you
talking about?

41:38.440 --> 41:40.640
I can't believe I
shot a man for you.

41:41.340 --> 41:42.740
I'm the one in pain.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.840
I got the emotional scars.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.140
You're not losing
any sleep over this.

41:48.140 --> 41:49.940
Maybe you're right.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.440
What'd you say?

41:54.540 --> 41:55.840
You're right, Calleigh.

41:56.840 --> 41:57.740
Nice to hear.

41:57.740 --> 41:59.040
Gotta admit...

41:59.340 --> 42:01.040
We are a good team.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.340
We have our moments.

42:07.740 --> 42:09.940
What happens to Kinkella?
He was just a pawn.

42:09.940 --> 42:11.940
My boss agreed
that if he fully cooperated

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
with the investigation,

42:13.040 --> 42:14.940
he could have
a chance at immunity.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.140
You know, ma'am, our
agencies really need

42:17.240 --> 42:18.740
to learn to communicate.

42:19.140 --> 42:22.040
Trust me, Lieutenant, from now
on when it comes to Miami,

42:22.540 --> 42:24.140
you'll be the first one I call.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.140
Yes, well, you've
got the number.

42:41.940 --> 42:45.640
<i>SONYA:
My plan is to just sit back,
relax,</i>

42:45.640 --> 42:48.340
<i>and watch as the world
we know changes forever.</i>
