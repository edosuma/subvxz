00:04.880 --> 00:06.210
[Des] What are we doing here?

00:06.250 --> 00:06.710
Why are we following Missus?

00:07.670 --> 00:08.920
[Mal] It's a good question.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.970
What did Saul say
to you exactly?

00:11.010 --> 00:12.130
[Jake]
He said, Follow Alisha.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.720
I wanna see what she's up to.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.720
He gave me her picture.
And that was it.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.260
What else do we
know about her?

00:17.300 --> 00:17.640
The call was
twenty minutes ago.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.310
So I didn't exactly have time
to do a background check.

00:21.350 --> 00:21.680
I don't like this.

[Des] Being an indebted

00:24.060 --> 00:24.270

to a psychopath gangster?

00:25.610 --> 00:26.690
Because Jake's daughter
stole money from you?

00:26.730 --> 00:27.400
Why wouldn't you like that?

00:28.860 --> 00:31.990
Hey Des. I think there's
something wrong with your phone.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.530
I think you're having
trouble hearing us.

00:33.570 --> 00:34.910
I can hear you just fine.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.490
- Then shut up!
- Ahhh!

00:36.530 --> 00:38.620
Speaking of Sloan, any word?

00:38.660 --> 00:41.000
No, but I think I've got a line
on where she's been staying.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.120
Des, do not tell Rose-

00:42.160 --> 00:43.210
about this debt to Saul.

00:43.250 --> 00:43.580
Copy.

00:44.750 --> 00:45.080
Don't tell Saul about
his debt to Rose.

00:46.330 --> 00:47.830
It's the other way around,
Des. I'm serious.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.420
- No need to worry her. - Hey, small flag.

00:49.460 --> 00:49.710
What if this Alisha
is a killer?

00:51.300 --> 00:53.090
'Cause right now she looks like
she's waiting for someone.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.130
She has this waiting for
someone look on her face.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.890
What if she kills the person
she's waiting for.

00:56.930 --> 00:57.850
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.220
There's some guy here.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.470
I don't know what they're
talking about.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.020
But it looks pretty intimate.

01:05.060 --> 01:06.980
Are we taking pictures of
Saul's cheating girlfriend?

01:08.270 --> 01:10.610
Vic Saul doesn't seem like the
type of person

01:10.650 --> 01:10.940
to take this subtle

01:12.400 --> 01:13.530
approach when it comes to a
cheating girlfriend.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.320
Oh my God. She looks
good in this view.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.160
I lost her.

01:17.910 --> 01:18.830
[Jake] I got her.

its lights at us?

Oh!

01:41.260 --> 01:42.180

- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.610
What just happened?

01:52.780 --> 01:53.990
We lost Alisha.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.570

That was quick.

03:13.110 --> 03:13.400
[Lydia]
I was his first call.

03:14.770 --> 03:17.110
And I was hoping you would
investigate his claim.

03:17.150 --> 03:17.400
We don't do
insurance cases.

03:18.950 --> 03:20.490
What my son means, is we haven't
done much Insurance work.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.530
No, I said, we don't do
insurance cases.

03:23.570 --> 03:24.870
Plus, we were in the accident.

03:24.910 --> 03:27.200
That's a slight conflict
of interest, no?

03:27.240 --> 03:28.500
You didn't hit
anybody.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.040
And you witnessed
the whole thing.

03:30.080 --> 03:30.290
So you're clear.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.830
You're bonded. You
have a good reputation.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.590
At least one of you does.

I suppose you're

03:37.000 --> 03:38.670

In my line of work,

03:40.050 --> 03:40.970
appearances are one thing.

Hard evidence is king.

All I need is a report on
Mr. Pearl's injury.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.110
Not one that pays.
This literally-

03:59.150 --> 04:01.570
fell in our laps. Right when
we can't scrape together

04:01.610 --> 04:03.280

And I don't want

04:03.320 --> 04:05.570
to point the finger as
to who's fault that is.

No one else.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.540

under the impression

04:16.580 --> 04:20.420
that I could skip the payment
per year without a penalty.

04:20.460 --> 04:24.510
And - No. Yeah. I did
notify you. I did.

Hey Rose. Is this a
bad time to mention

04:53.160 --> 04:54.170
Does Jake know you're here?

04:54.210 --> 04:54.420
No.

04:55.580 --> 04:57.290
Of course not.
He's worried about her.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.840
So why would she do him the
courtesy of

04:58.880 --> 05:00.840
letting him know she's alive?

You have some serious guts

05:02.460 --> 05:03.840

05:03.880 --> 05:05.260
I wanted to talk to you.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.390
To tell you how sorry I am.

05:07.430 --> 05:08.720
Sorry doesn't pay my mortgage.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.180
[Des] Or a paycheck.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.350
You know I'm working for free
these days, basically.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.270
I now consider bologna
a luxury item.

05:14.310 --> 05:15.310
Seriously, how does
that even happen?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.020
I know I deserve this,
but I promise,

05:18.060 --> 05:20.150
I'm gonna find a way to make
it up to you guys.

05:20.190 --> 05:22.780
[Rose] Yeah. Well, Jake may
have forgiven you.

05:24.610 --> 05:27.820
But I think it's gonna be a long
while before the rest of us do.

05:30.120 --> 05:30.450
[Des]
Look, Sloan.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.620
I know it all sounds
really harsh.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.290
But I think, you know-

05:35.330 --> 05:36.460
Once you talk to -

05:36.500 --> 05:37.580
- [door slams]

suffer because of-

05:48.180 --> 05:49.890
this crash. No wonder
he's so mad.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.180
What's to investigate?

05:51.220 --> 05:51.430
Donny Pearl runs a red light.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.890
Won't that just
disqualify his policy?

05:53.930 --> 05:55.810
Not if it was unintentional.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.440
He said the bright sunlight
obscured the view.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.270
He's got a disability
insurance policy

06:00.310 --> 06:02.360
that pays out very
substantially if he can't work.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.070

record.

06:06.110 --> 06:08.410
And no fraud charges whatsoever.

he's made over thirty

06:10.070 --> 06:12.080
complaints to the police
in the last three months.

06:12.910 --> 06:13.200
What's this guy's problem?

much noise.

damage, which is like

06:23.670 --> 06:25.130
impossible to
disprove.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.760
Which means we need
more than pictures.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.470
We need to prove this guy
can go back to work.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.760
Dirt. That's nutting but dirt.

06:33.430 --> 06:35.720

the guy shoveling his driveway.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.520
Or mowing his lawn, or
gardening, or whatever.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.020
This is real scumbag

work folder and pick out

06:41.980 --> 06:43.110
another.

06:43.150 --> 06:43.860

06:44.940 --> 06:46.690
So unless you have any better
jobs

06:46.730 --> 06:49.400
besides running errands
for criminals. We're taking it.

cheating on him?

07:00.870 --> 07:01.170
I'll be honest.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.420
I'm afraid it's a little more
complicated than that.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.930

I don't know who you are.

07:16.560 --> 07:16.890

07:18.140 --> 07:18.430
You're on my property!
Get off my property!

07:19.730 --> 07:21.060
I'm not on your property.
This is a sidewalk.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.350
I'm not on your property.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.520
You did this.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.900
You ruined my gig.

Get away from me!

07:27.440 --> 07:30.450
You owe me. You owe
me for what you did.

07:30.490 --> 07:31.530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:31.570 --> 07:33.200
Get the hell away from here.

07:33.240 --> 07:33.490

07:34.660 --> 07:36.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy.

07:36.120 --> 07:36.990
Take it easy!

07:39.790 --> 07:40.040
You're trespassing.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.750
No, we're on a public street.
And you're shooting a gun at us.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.170
No. You are within City
Ordinance

07:45.210 --> 07:46.590
of four point three feet-

07:46.630 --> 07:46.960
from my property line.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.420
Which entitles me to protect
my home and myself.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.220
[Jake] OK, that's ridiculous.
Put the gun down.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.970
Why were you fighting
with the Puffin Man?

07:54.010 --> 07:55.550
Wasn't he driving
the van you hit?

07:55.600 --> 07:55.930
[Donny] You're from the
insurance company?

07:57.100 --> 07:58.310
You've got no
authority here, Mall Cop.

07:58.930 --> 07:59.230
It's like I said.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.020
The bright light blinded
me. I deserve that money.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.310
I'm all fooled up.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.570
Alright. Just calm down.

08:07.730 --> 08:08.360
Are you using rock salt?

08:09.900 --> 08:12.490
I use it for the feral cats to
keep them from my hot tub.

08:12.530 --> 08:12.820
You shoot cats?

08:14.030 --> 08:15.570
To scare them. Keep
them from drowning.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.700
I'm not into killing
cats, Mall Cop.

08:19.410 --> 08:21.370
[whale sounds on player]

08:22.580 --> 08:25.120
Wait. Are you playing
whale music there?

08:25.170 --> 08:27.790
Soothing sounds from Cape Spear.
It's supposed to make me calm.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.300
How's that working for you?

08:29.340 --> 08:29.630
Fine.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.680
Until the insurance company
sent stooges to railroad me.

08:33.550 --> 08:33.760
You know, there was a time

08:35.050 --> 08:35.300
a conversation like this
would get away from me.

08:36.930 --> 08:39.260
Yeah, like five seconds ago when
you almost killed buddy here?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.890
It's no wonder you're
such a negative person.

08:40.930 --> 08:42.640
Look how you earn
your living.

08:42.680 --> 08:44.060
Won't be so easy getting me.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.980
Bunch of parasites.

08:46.400 --> 08:46.730
Taxi!

08:47.900 --> 08:48.900
[Jake] I think you should
deal with this

08:48.940 --> 08:50.320
while I go talk
to Saul.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.860
I'll call Rose to pick me up.

08:51.900 --> 08:52.900
Now go on.

08:52.950 --> 08:53.530
And be careful out of it.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.780
Put this back in the man's
house, will ya?

09:18.890 --> 09:20.470
Sloan. What are you up to?

09:21.520 --> 09:21.810
[Mal] Donny was not kidding

09:22.930 --> 09:23.230
about the sun
obscuring that light.

09:24.350 --> 09:24.640
Well I'm sure he
could still see a van.

09:26.060 --> 09:26.350
If his eyes are getting as bad
as mine, maybe not.

09:27.940 --> 09:30.650
As long as I can see you, who
care's about the rest, huh?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.490
The bank said we were supposed
to be able to miss a payment.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.400
But the manager was
not very agreeable.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.700
I was hoping for more
of a "wow" reaction.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.330
But now that it's out there,
we'll figure something out.

09:41.370 --> 09:42.620
Where's old Jake now?

09:42.660 --> 09:42.950
Running a few more errands.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.710
You just happen to
have surveillance

09:45.750 --> 09:46.000
equipment from
the office because-?

09:47.370 --> 09:49.040
[Mal] These marks, dents.
Where'd they come from?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.540
Do these errands have-

09:50.590 --> 09:52.050
anything to do with Sloan?

09:52.090 --> 09:54.170
She was at the house
this morning, Mal.

09:54.210 --> 09:57.260
If she's got us in more of a
mess, I need to know about it.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.760
Sloan is Jake's daughter.
My granddaughter.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.050
Yes, she did a horrible thing.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.220
We just need to make sure
she's safe. That's all.

10:03.100 --> 10:03.350
Donny did not hit this pole.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.440
Because his truck stopped in
the intersection

10:06.480 --> 10:07.600
where it hit the Puffin Van.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.400
[Mal] Come on.
I got an idea.

10:12.440 --> 10:12.690
I need your word-

10:14.320 --> 10:16.450
that there is nothing else going
on here I need to know about.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.570
No. Now, come on dear.

10:22.490 --> 10:23.950
Just gonna leave
me hanging here?

10:27.160 --> 10:27.500
Well, well well.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.000
If it isn't my
favorite cop duo.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.500
Well, half, anyway.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.250
I assume I'm the half
you like the least.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.840
See Hood, I always knew there
was

10:35.880 --> 10:37.340
a detective in there, somewhere.

10:38.090 --> 10:39.140
I'll get us some coffee.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.470
Thanks.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.890
You never return my
calls or my texts.

10:43.930 --> 10:44.600
I've been-

10:45.180 --> 10:45.520
I dunno, busy.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.100
Busy. You come over to my
place. We sleep together.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.440
And then you
completely ignore me.

10:51.480 --> 10:51.770
I gotta be honest.

10:53.190 --> 10:56.780
I'm starting to feel
a little bit used for my body.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.320
You wanna take the
rest of the day off?

10:58.360 --> 10:59.320
Go back to my place?

11:02.410 --> 11:03.910
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

11:04.990 --> 11:05.330
You sure?

11:06.410 --> 11:08.080
You seem a little bit
distracted.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.620
Fine. Forget I suggested it.

11:09.660 --> 11:11.290
Wait, wait, wait, Leslie.

11:13.960 --> 11:14.250
Are you back on active duty?

11:15.630 --> 11:17.800
Not really. Not on my own.
There's some red tape.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.130
I know my way around it.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.630
And this is none of
your business anyway.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.340
Okay?

11:22.800 --> 11:27.140
Right. I gotta ask. Are we
doing this thing together?

11:27.180 --> 11:29.060
Or not. Because
from where I'm standing-

11:29.100 --> 11:30.810
It definitely feels
like we're not.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.190
[Hood] The detective
in me deduced

11:35.230 --> 11:36.610
that you didn't need one.

11:36.650 --> 11:37.820
And you're a dick.

11:39.530 --> 11:39.860
Look. I'm sorry.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.530
I'll call you.
We'll talk later.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.410
I'm just not myself.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.460
Let me guess.
Vic Saul sent you?

11:58.920 --> 11:59.880
When I don't hear
from my staff.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
I tend to take that personal.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.720
I'm not your staff.

12:03.760 --> 12:04.760
And you only put me on this
girl, Alisha this morning.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.770
You're daughter forced you
into a debt with me.

12:08.810 --> 12:10.020
So when I call,

12:10.060 --> 12:11.100
[crash]

12:13.480 --> 12:14.860
Answer the phone.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.770
Feel better?

12:16.730 --> 12:17.070
I might.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.780
If I knew what
Alisha was up to.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.740
So far, nudding.

12:21.780 --> 12:23.990
And that's the extent of
your work so far?

12:24.030 --> 12:25.200
I could be working on her,
right now.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.490
Except for you have me here.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.200
Anyone ever warn you about
micromanagement?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.000
Anybody every warn you about
pissing me off?

12:31.040 --> 12:33.660
Look. This would be
a lot easier for me if you just

12:33.710 --> 12:35.710
told me what it is that you
don't trust about her.

12:35.750 --> 12:39.050
Or maybe, tell me what it is
that you want me to find out.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.340
Why don't you do your job and
find out for yourself.

12:41.340 --> 12:41.630
I'll give you the
rest of the day.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.800
If you don't do it,
we have a problem.

12:45.050 --> 12:47.930
And Jake, you and I-
We have enough problems.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.350
It's always a pleasure
to see you Saul.

12:55.770 --> 12:56.980
[Rose] Where have you been?

12:57.900 --> 13:01.860
Uh, having tea with a friend.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.950
Rose said that Sloan was
at the house today.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.120
Oh, thank God. I was
worried sick. I was.

13:10.580 --> 13:11.660
Well, I'm surprised she hasn't
robbed the place by now.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.790
Look, Rose. Having a gangster
teenaged daughter

13:15.830 --> 13:17.710
isn't sitting well
with me either.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.250
But at least she's not
out on the street.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.210
Not yet

13:20.250 --> 13:21.170
There's Donny's pickup.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.840
Might as well go have a look.

13:28.970 --> 13:29.510
You coming, or what?

13:30.430 --> 13:32.180
Over that fence? No thank you.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.100
Five years ago, you would have
made the jump.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.390
We already looked at the trunk.
We went through the gate here.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.770
Unlike you, I tend to learn
with the passage of time.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.110
Now look at the front bumper.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.320
And the photos we sent.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.120
This has been repaired
recently.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.280
Used to be orange.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.870
Matches the pole.

13:50.910 --> 13:53.240
His vehicle
made those dents on it.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.450
But Donny didn't
hit that pole.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.080
Not this morning he didn't.

13:56.120 --> 14:00.170
So, same intersection.
Different accident.

14:00.210 --> 14:01.920
Same pole.
What's going on here?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.050
Practice crash?

14:03.090 --> 14:04.260
So he was polishing his scam.

14:04.760 --> 14:04.970
This time-

14:06.470 --> 14:07.930
When he hit the pole,
he wanted to hit it hard enough

14:07.970 --> 14:08.260
so it looked like
he was actually hurt.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.680
And a speeding van ruins his
perfectly planned accident.

14:12.720 --> 14:12.970
Well, we're gonna
need some proof.

14:14.430 --> 14:15.940
I'll check some old CCTV
footage from the intersection.

14:17.310 --> 14:19.440
Should we canvass the
witnesses to the accident?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.690
Maybe one of them saw
something that we missed.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.230
Or we could talk to buddy.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.030
Hey. Billy.

14:31.990 --> 14:32.580
You two were at the
accident today.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.290
We're investigating one of
the drivers' insurance claim.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.790
Whats-his-name's truck
you were just looking at.

14:38.830 --> 14:39.790
Donny Pearl.

14:39.830 --> 14:40.880
It was his fault.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.250
Why did you flee the scene?

14:42.290 --> 14:44.210
Before you could
speak to the cops?

14:44.250 --> 14:46.510
I'm my own boss.
Time is money.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.720
And there were plenty of other
witnesses at the scene.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.050
Did he give you any reason to
think that he might have done

14:51.090 --> 14:51.390
this whole thing on purpose?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.470
Either the guy was the biggest
idiot in the world,

14:54.510 --> 14:55.890
or he was trying to kill me.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.640
Is that a cam-corder
in your dash?

14:58.690 --> 14:58.980
Was that on this morning?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.690
No, I only have it
on when I'm at work.

15:01.730 --> 15:02.650
Insurance reasons.

15:02.690 --> 15:03.730
And your man, Donny?

15:03.770 --> 15:04.690
He wasn't
even hurt.

15:04.730 --> 15:05.030
How do you know that?

15:05.940 --> 15:06.320
I've towed a
million cars-

15:07.530 --> 15:08.570
from a million accidents.
I've seen it all.

15:08.610 --> 15:08.900
Both his airbags went.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.620
Believe me, He's not hurt.
And if he says he is-

15:13.660 --> 15:14.540
He's lying.

15:16.490 --> 15:16.830
[Lydia] You don't have enough.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.330
[Jake] Enough. What are
you talking about?

15:19.790 --> 15:21.670
We can prove that Donny staged
this accident himself.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.420
Old paint scuffs on
his bumper?

15:24.460 --> 15:26.670
And we have a
witness at the scene

15:26.710 --> 15:28.460
corroborating our theories.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.300
Men why leave the scene of car
crashes

15:30.340 --> 15:32.010
don't make great witnesses.

15:32.050 --> 15:34.010
All the evidence
points to fraud.

15:35.850 --> 15:38.020
If I recommend deny
and lose in court,

15:38.060 --> 15:40.600
my company pays more
than the value of the policy.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.690
Which means, goodbye
to my year end bonus.

15:44.730 --> 15:46.730
And goodbye to
your connection to me.

15:46.780 --> 15:47.820
[Jake slams down the file]

15:49.110 --> 15:50.400
Do you have a problem
with this, Mr. Doyle?

15:50.450 --> 15:50.740
[Mal]
No.

15:51.660 --> 15:51.860
No he doesn't.
Right Jake?

15:52.780 --> 15:53.070
Shut up. Yeah, I do, actually.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.830
I think you need us
to finish this thing.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.370
Get Donny to admit he
committed fraud.

15:58.410 --> 16:00.460
Or get more
substantial evidence.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.580
In other words, do your job.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.960
Get your head back
in the game.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.880
Or I'll use Des as my partner.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.280
[click]

16:33.990 --> 16:35.030
[click]

16:35.070 --> 16:36.070
[click]

16:36.120 --> 16:37.030
[click]

16:37.080 --> 16:37.950
[click]

16:47.420 --> 16:48.550
Are you following me?

16:48.590 --> 16:49.880
What are you doing, Sloan?

16:52.510 --> 16:54.130
[knock]

16:54.180 --> 16:56.550
Donny? You in there?

16:56.590 --> 16:57.810
[Donny]
This is harassment.

17:02.390 --> 17:03.560
You know -

17:04.890 --> 17:05.150
seeing
how you shot at us,

17:06.520 --> 17:09.270
the least you could do is
answer a few questions.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.650
You deserved worse.

17:10.690 --> 17:10.980
I know what you're doing.

17:12.610 --> 17:14.530
Trying to aggravate me to the
point of incriminating myself.

17:14.570 --> 17:15.950
Well you can't.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.990
Maybe the old Donny.
Not this one.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.740
Starting to stimulate
the meridian.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.250
There it is.

17:22.870 --> 17:24.160
Feel no stress.

17:24.210 --> 17:24.540
No aggravation.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.000
[Mal] We can prove that
this was fraud, Donny.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.790
So we need you to talk to us.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.500
'Cause not only will
you get nothing-

17:30.550 --> 17:32.000
You'll also go to jail.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.670
Alright. I'm starting
to lose my temper.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.090
Gotta go line up my
Chi or something.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.510
Don't make me use this.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.180
I wouldn't
do that if I was you.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.980
Oh, don't be so jaded,
Mall Cop.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.140
You should unwind,
take a soak.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.140
Donny, no!

17:46.190 --> 17:48.060
[sizzle]

17:49.400 --> 17:51.110
Hang on, Dad. Wait!

17:51.530 --> 17:52.400
Now!

17:56.990 --> 17:58.910
I'll call an ambulance.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.040
[Leslie] Donny's insisting that
somebody put the stereo

18:03.080 --> 18:05.910
in the hot tub intentionally
to electrocute him.

18:05.960 --> 18:06.210
And you don't
believe that theory?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.040
He's got no proof.
But anything's possible.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.340
Hey, I was just
thinking, maybe-

18:15.260 --> 18:18.470
Maybe we could have a
conversation. Just a little one.

18:18.510 --> 18:21.050
A few minutes where you're not
acting all weird with me.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.140
Sorry about before. I'm just-

18:23.180 --> 18:25.270
I'm feeling off.
I can't shake it.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.440
That's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.100
I mean, Leslie.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.230
You've gone through
a very traumatic experience.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.570
You can't go through stuff
like this alone.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.490
Jake. I'm not sure
I want this.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.410
What?

18:40.450 --> 18:42.200
Us. You and me.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.450
I'm not sure of anything
right now. I need time.

18:44.490 --> 18:44.830
Look. I gotta go.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.370
No, no, no. You can't
just drop a bomb-

18:47.410 --> 18:48.330
Hello Sergeant.

18:48.370 --> 18:49.460
Hello there.

18:50.750 --> 18:54.130
Oh. Okay I will see you
there soon, Leslie.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.760
Are you Jake Doyle?

18:58.180 --> 18:59.090
Yeah.

18:59.130 --> 19:00.680
Dr. Jon Ronan.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.760
I'll leave you to it.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.310
I'll see you soon.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.480
Look. I gotta go.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
It isn't
what you think.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.690
I'm not thinking anything.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.690
It's not. Okay?

19:14.730 --> 19:15.940
Leslie.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.740
So? How is he?

19:25.790 --> 19:26.830
[Mal]
He's alive.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.160
Insurance company
would rather kill me

19:30.210 --> 19:31.750
than give me what they owe me.

19:31.790 --> 19:33.130
Bunch of psychos.

19:33.170 --> 19:33.460
You don't actually think

19:34.710 --> 19:36.130
an insurance
company would try to kill you?

19:36.170 --> 19:36.460
I wouldn't
put it-

19:37.460 --> 19:37.760
past them. Money
grubbing leaches.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.840
Plus Curtis Breen attacks me
outside my house, remember?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.640
And the tow truck driver
nearly took my head off.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.760
A lot of people wanna hurt
me since this accident.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.810
I'm sure that's been a
lifelong theme with you.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.810
B'ys I need your help. Right?

19:49.850 --> 19:51.980
According to the laws of the
universe. You gotta help me,

19:52.020 --> 19:53.020
or karma will kill you.
Look it up.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.560
I'm not sure it works
that way.

19:55.610 --> 19:57.320
I'm not asking you to do
anything untoward.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.940
Just find out who's
trying to kill me.

20:00.150 --> 20:01.200
I'll give you ten percent
of my settlement.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.950
Well now, that's very
interesting.

20:03.990 --> 20:04.870
Jake.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.370
We already have a client.

20:08.410 --> 20:10.040
Why can't we have two?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.790
[Sloan] I got a job.

20:12.830 --> 20:14.290
Okay? Relax.
That's all this is.

20:14.330 --> 20:14.670
A job?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.750
With Shady McShade Shade
Shade's back there.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.340
I answered an ad on-line.
And now I have a job.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.670
And it's not a sex thing.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.590
So don't get your
bra in a knot.

20:24.260 --> 20:25.850
Sorry.
Okay.

20:25.890 --> 20:29.350
So you took a job on-line.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.100
Delivering mysterious
packages.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.480
Seriously,
that's your story.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.860
Here. This one fell out.
I have to return it.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.520
Fabric samples.

20:37.570 --> 20:37.770
I pick them up at an office

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
and deliver them to my boss who
brings them on sales calls.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.860
Cool. How much
you make for this?

20:43.910 --> 20:44.240
Five hundred.

20:45.530 --> 20:46.530
Five hundred? A week?
That's not very much.

20:46.570 --> 20:47.410
Per delivery.

20:48.910 --> 20:51.000
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.620
He sells all over the place.
Upholstery companies.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.120
Clothing manufacturers.

20:54.170 --> 20:54.460
Designers.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.840
I just took it so I can help
out with the mortgage.

21:03.380 --> 21:03.680
Hey.

21:04.880 --> 21:05.970
I gotta head back to the
station. You okay?

21:06.010 --> 21:06.390
Yeah. Okay.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.350
You're a cop. What
looks illegal about this?

21:25.530 --> 21:26.820
How's your week?

21:27.990 --> 21:30.160
I come to work. I do my job.
I go home.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.450
You feel-

21:31.490 --> 21:33.040
ready to get back
to active cases?

21:34.910 --> 21:37.210
It's up to you, isn't it?

21:37.250 --> 21:38.710
No, sergeant. It's up to you.

21:38.750 --> 21:39.000
Come on doctor.

21:40.250 --> 21:41.630
We both know I'm waiting for
you to clear me.

21:41.670 --> 21:43.300
I'm waiting for you to talk.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.970
I've been talking.

21:46.550 --> 21:47.640
No, you haven't.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.640
You want me to open up about
how I feel. I told you.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.850
I feel fine.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.810
You nearly died.
They buried you alive.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.400
Yeah, well tell me
what word to use.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.360
You want me to say
I'm scared? I'm angry?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.570
Because I don't feel anything.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.700
Let's talk about Jake.

22:13.450 --> 22:14.620
Does he know about us?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Us?

22:17.330 --> 22:19.460
I don't want Jake knowing
about this.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.880
Why is that?

22:20.920 --> 22:23.000
'Cause this is my issue.
Not his.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.460
Can we not talk
about him anymore?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.880
So you admit this is an issue.

22:25.920 --> 22:26.170
I didn't say that.

22:27.090 --> 22:31.300
Bennett.
Recovery takes time.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.430
Let people help you, Leslie.

22:34.470 --> 22:35.640
I just want you to see

22:35.680 --> 22:38.230
that you're not
alone.

22:40.270 --> 22:42.110
[Jake] Ten percent of his
insurance claim. I mean-

22:43.190 --> 22:43.400
that's a lot of
mortgage payments.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.900
It's not like we're going to be
betraying our actual client.

22:46.950 --> 22:47.240
I don't know.

22:48.280 --> 22:48.530
I got some more intel
on Alisha.

22:49.990 --> 22:52.280
She's got no criminal record.
Went to business school.

22:52.330 --> 22:52.620
She's a smart cookie.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.080
[Jake] We know any girl with
an education is not gonna be

22:56.120 --> 22:56.460
dating Vic Saul.

22:57.790 --> 22:58.790
I wish he'd just tell us why
we're tailing 'em.

22:58.830 --> 22:59.120
Buddy in the-

23:00.630 --> 23:02.630
car here: Kevin Paul. Real
estate developer. No record.

23:02.670 --> 23:02.920
Huh.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.460
I saw you with Leslie
at the hospital.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.340
She's all over the map.
You know?

23:08.380 --> 23:09.840
I don't know what's
wrong with her.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.970
She's been through a lot.

23:12.970 --> 23:14.260
Yeah. I know.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.720
She had a near death
experience.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.520
You don't bounce back from
that overnight.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.690
I just-

23:19.270 --> 23:19.520
I don't know.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.860
I feel like now is the time that
we should be with each other.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.400
We should have each
other's backs.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.070
She's just so hot and cold.

23:27.110 --> 23:27.490
One minute she's all over me.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.530
And the next minute
she won't even-

23:30.320 --> 23:30.570
return my phone calls.

23:32.030 --> 23:33.950
All over you? Is that what the
kids call it these days.

23:33.990 --> 23:34.910
Shut up.

23:36.950 --> 23:37.830
[Mal] Heads up.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.380
[Jake] That is a lot of money.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.710
What's
going on here?

23:43.750 --> 23:45.090
You think Alisha
robbed Saul?

23:45.130 --> 23:46.590
Well, Saul doesn't trust her.

23:46.630 --> 23:48.170
And he definitely
doesn't trust us.

23:48.210 --> 23:49.300
Maybe we should make friends.

23:49.340 --> 23:49.630
You think that's a good idea?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.340
We gotta get out
from underneath this guy.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.600
This could be our chance.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.640
You know what?

23:55.680 --> 23:57.720
I'm gonna go talk to her.

23:59.430 --> 24:00.940
Maybe not.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.150
[phone rings]

24:10.110 --> 24:10.490
Any news?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.660
Yeah. I found images from
two separate days

24:14.700 --> 24:17.700
of Donny gently gliding his
truck into that pole.

24:17.740 --> 24:18.740
Just like we thought.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.080
So, he planned the crash.

24:20.290 --> 24:20.580
If you arrange the accident.
It's fraud.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.960
This is the evidence you need
to get that check from Lydia.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.420
[Rose] There's something
else you should know.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.920
Our little friend over at
the Impound lot-

24:26.960 --> 24:28.420
Billy Davidson.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.710
The tow truck driver.

24:29.760 --> 24:29.970
Yeah. He's also-

24:31.050 --> 24:32.630
a champion
smash derby car driver.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.130
[Mal] You don't say.

24:34.220 --> 24:34.510
[Jake] He crashes
cars for money.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.760
Coincidence? Doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.390
Well, it could be that Donny

24:40.430 --> 24:42.690
wasn't intending
to hit that stop light.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.770
Maybe he hired a derby driver

24:44.810 --> 24:46.190
to help him with
his insurance scam.

24:46.230 --> 24:46.520
Better talk to Billy again.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.730
[Rose] He's got a Derby heat

24:48.780 --> 24:48.980
in thirty minutes.

24:49.900 --> 24:53.110
Oh. Rose. Any word from Sloan?

24:53.150 --> 24:55.700
No, she went
somewhere with Des. Why?

24:55.740 --> 24:56.780
I'm not allowed to ask?

24:56.820 --> 24:57.910
Well, where are you guys?

24:57.950 --> 24:59.870
What are you up to right now?

25:02.290 --> 25:04.210
For the record, your silence
is incriminating.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.670
Yeah. Sorry about that.

25:21.180 --> 25:24.020
Why is the Puffin Man here?

25:24.060 --> 25:25.690
Good question.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.360
[Billy]
The hell?

25:35.660 --> 25:36.450
I have not been paid.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.450
And my business is ruined.

25:38.490 --> 25:39.530
Because of you.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.660
So you're stealing from me?

25:40.700 --> 25:41.660
I know that look, Billy.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.620
Just-

25:42.660 --> 25:43.540
Take it easy.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.080
Which one of you did it?

25:46.120 --> 25:47.250
What's this? What's going on?

25:47.290 --> 25:48.210
Donny? What are you doing?

25:48.250 --> 25:48.500
P.I.s?

25:49.460 --> 25:49.630
Remember Karma
and all of that?

25:50.630 --> 25:51.500
[Donny]
Sometimes you gotta take

25:51.550 --> 25:51.880
Karma in your own hands.

25:53.010 --> 25:53.300
And shoot someone
in the face with it.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.340
I know one of
you electrocuted me.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.680
And I wanna know which one.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.340
Donny. What's in the gun?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.220
Let's just say it's
loaded with justice.

26:00.260 --> 26:00.560
I want a confession.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.640
Don't shoot anyone. Alright?
It would be very bad for you.

26:04.680 --> 26:08.520
You mean, bad for you. You
won't get paid. Is that it?

26:08.560 --> 26:09.560
[bang]

26:09.610 --> 26:10.690
I know one of you-

26:10.730 --> 26:11.690
terrorists did it.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.230
So please confess.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.860
Or at the very least promise-

26:14.900 --> 26:16.990
to let me
live my life in peace.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.660
Son of a bitch stole
my dash cam!

26:29.130 --> 26:30.590
Donny!

26:30.630 --> 26:31.500
Oof!

26:32.960 --> 26:33.210
What are you--?

26:34.090 --> 26:34.880
[Alisha]
You know who I am.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.220
Big fella.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.590
You're gonna tell me why
your following me.

26:42.050 --> 26:44.010
[Alisha] Vic Saul hired
you to watch me?

26:44.060 --> 26:46.560
Yeah, but he didn't say for
what, exactly.

26:46.600 --> 26:46.890
Well, did you see
anything good?

26:48.270 --> 26:50.270
I keep my blinds closed as
you may have noticed.

26:50.310 --> 26:50.520
Yeah.

26:51.810 --> 26:55.650
I saw you meeting with a
guy. His name is Kevin.

26:55.690 --> 26:56.860
- Boring.
- He was carrying-

26:56.900 --> 26:57.780
a briefcase
full of cash.

26:58.740 --> 27:00.240
Now you're just showing off.

27:00.280 --> 27:00.620
I got a feeling if I told-

27:01.950 --> 27:03.660
Saul about any of
this, he'd kill whatever plans

27:04.450 --> 27:05.660
you're making with Kevin-

27:05.700 --> 27:07.040
to spend all Saul's cash.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.250
So why haven't you told him?

27:09.830 --> 27:12.420
I was thinking that maybe you
and I, we could chat first.

27:12.460 --> 27:14.170
We could come to some sort of

27:14.210 --> 27:14.550
arrangement.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.420
What kind of arrangement did
you have in mind?

27:17.470 --> 27:18.340
I'm all ears.

27:18.380 --> 27:20.090
Sharing of information.

27:20.130 --> 27:22.930
I'm just saying. We both have
dealings with the man.

27:22.970 --> 27:25.600
Maybe, possibly-

27:25.640 --> 27:27.270
We could help
each other out.

27:27.310 --> 27:29.770
You want us to team
up against Vic Saul?

27:29.810 --> 27:32.150
Those are your words.
Not mine.

27:33.150 --> 27:34.650
But maybe.

27:34.690 --> 27:37.820
I wouldn't go down that
route, if I were you.

27:38.610 --> 27:38.900
Vic Saul gets-

27:40.110 --> 27:41.870
nasty when he
thinks he's been betrayed.

27:42.910 --> 27:44.870
You'd rather I just
rat you out?

27:44.910 --> 27:46.950
If you think you need to.

27:48.700 --> 27:52.380
But for now, I will keep this
conversation between us.

27:54.630 --> 27:55.840
Okay then.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.640
How'd that go?

28:05.680 --> 28:07.390
Not good.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.350
Did you hear Billy
say something about,

28:09.390 --> 28:11.480
Curtis stole something from him?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.100
Yeah, Curtis came for
that dash cam.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.150
I bet he wanted footage
of the crash.

28:15.190 --> 28:16.770
So Billy's a derby driver.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.650
And obviously he lied to us-

28:18.690 --> 28:20.990
about not running the cam
during the accident.

28:21.030 --> 28:23.280
I'm starting to get the feeling
that this attack against Donny

28:23.320 --> 28:24.910
wasn't just about revenge.

28:24.950 --> 28:26.530
Did that crash have three
people planning it?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.660
[phone rings]

28:30.200 --> 28:30.500
[Rose] Hey.

28:31.830 --> 28:34.250
Curtis Breen did a stretch
for assault in 2008.

28:34.290 --> 28:36.540
And then again in 2011.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.050
What about his insurance?

28:38.090 --> 28:39.630
Uh huh.
He uses Lydia's company.

28:39.670 --> 28:39.960
So does Billy
Davidson.

28:41.340 --> 28:44.300
All three of them use Lydia's
insurance company.

28:44.340 --> 28:44.680
Yeah. She's the link.

28:45.930 --> 28:47.050
I'm beginning to think
this was supposed

28:47.100 --> 28:48.220
to be a three
car crash.

28:48.260 --> 28:48.520
Yeah. but if they're-

28:49.890 --> 28:51.390
partners. Why would one of
them try and kill Donny?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.060
It involves a lot
of money. Which is

28:53.100 --> 28:55.900
why idiots often try
to kill other idiots.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.360
[screaming]

28:58.400 --> 28:59.320
I'll call you back.

29:08.990 --> 29:09.450
[Mal]
Curtis.

29:10.580 --> 29:10.910
Either this fella was
unlucky enough

29:12.040 --> 29:12.750
to get hit by a car
twice in one day.

29:13.830 --> 29:16.960
Or we're looking at
a murder victim.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.710
[Leslie] How many crime scenes
does a man on bail really

29:20.750 --> 29:22.460
need to be found
at in one day?

29:22.510 --> 29:24.380
I'm getting in trouble
just talking to you.

29:24.430 --> 29:24.630
[Mal]
I'm sorry, Leslie. But-

29:26.050 --> 29:27.970
you know we had nothing to
do with Curtis's death.

29:28.010 --> 29:28.300
[Jake]
So we're thinking that

29:29.760 --> 29:31.850
someone threw Curtis in front
of a moving derby car.

29:31.890 --> 29:33.480
That's what the driver thinks.
But nobody saw-

29:33.520 --> 29:34.890
who in all the chaos.

29:34.940 --> 29:35.230
We're investigating
a fraud

29:36.400 --> 29:38.730
case with a bunch of
idiot masterminds.

29:38.770 --> 29:40.780
Who all seem to be
turning on each other.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.230
The victim, Curtis Breen.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.570
You think he tried
to kill Donny Pearl?

29:44.610 --> 29:44.860
Then who killed Curtis?

29:46.490 --> 29:49.080
Well, we think Billy. Because
Billy and Curtis were in a fight

29:49.120 --> 29:50.740
just before Curtis died.

29:50.780 --> 29:52.410
Why do you think Billy
killed Curtis?

29:52.450 --> 29:52.750
Over a dash cam.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.750
Which somehow links Billy to
this insurance scam.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.210
I'll have our guys
look into it.

29:57.250 --> 29:57.540
But seriously, Jake.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.550
If you find yourself in a
situation like this again.

30:01.420 --> 30:02.710
I don't know if I can help.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.090
Sorry, son.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.600
[Sloan] Okay, look.
I'm not stupid.

30:10.640 --> 30:10.850
I know something's up.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.140
I thought maybe rip off designer
clothing. But on my end-

30:14.180 --> 30:15.310
I just courier fabric samples.

30:15.350 --> 30:16.350
Right. Okay.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.360
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yeah.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.150
It's cocaine.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.530
Tinny searched police
blotters. And this is a growing

30:26.570 --> 30:28.110
trend amongst clever scumbags.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.120
I had no idea.

30:29.160 --> 30:29.450
Yeah. Maybe so.

30:30.950 --> 30:33.240
But if we don't report this,
you're in serious trouble.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.500
And I mean now.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.120
[Lydia] You're not hearing me.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.670
I don't want to fight this.

30:39.710 --> 30:41.460
But we know Donny set
up his own accident.

30:41.500 --> 30:41.710
I think-

30:42.670 --> 30:44.170
it's easier
to just settle.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.510
Make that happen please?

30:45.550 --> 30:45.800
[Jake] Why would you
want to settle?

30:46.720 --> 30:47.010
We can prove
that it's fraud.

30:48.090 --> 30:48.300
Because he's
threatened to sue us.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.970
Law suits cause bad press.
Murders are even worse.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.060
You're the insurance company.

30:53.100 --> 30:53.390
Don't you have deep pockets?

30:54.930 --> 30:57.230
Plus we found out that Billy
is basically a stunt driver.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.150
[Mal] And the other driver,
Curtis Breen is dead.

31:00.190 --> 31:01.060
We believe this whole
thing is connected.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.030
You know what? Forget it.
This arrangement's over.

31:06.070 --> 31:06.400
Leave it alone.

31:07.450 --> 31:08.570
Send me an invoice
for your time.

31:08.610 --> 31:09.200
[Jake]
Why would an exec

31:09.990 --> 31:11.450
at an insurance company

31:11.490 --> 31:13.030
not want to
know when she's being defrauded?

31:13.080 --> 31:13.370
[Mal]
Because-

31:14.240 --> 31:15.080
she's part
of the fraud?

31:15.870 --> 31:16.160
Excuse me?

31:17.370 --> 31:18.960
What are you tangled
up in here, exactly?

31:20.580 --> 31:23.290
If I wasn't clear a second
ago, you're fired.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.550
So, mind your own business.

31:27.170 --> 31:29.720
[phone rings]

31:35.260 --> 31:36.270
Hello.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.140
You have something for me?

31:38.890 --> 31:40.900
[Jake] Yeah. I'll meet
you in about an hour.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.230
Figured out the
play with Saul?

31:46.480 --> 31:47.690
Not really. Not yet.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.240
[door slams]

31:49.280 --> 31:50.360
[Donny]
Fellas.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.030
Police think I killed Curtis.

31:54.070 --> 31:55.080
Can you blame 'em?

31:55.120 --> 31:56.490
What?
Why would I-

31:56.540 --> 31:56.830
kill anybody?

31:58.080 --> 31:59.750
No, no, no. No, doing
something like that

31:59.790 --> 32:02.040
would knock me out of
one-ness with the Cosmos.

32:02.080 --> 32:02.290
And the stars and stuff.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.210
[Mal] Well, firstly. It
seems pretty obvious-

32:05.250 --> 32:06.800
You're in the middle of some

32:06.840 --> 32:08.670
huge scam
with a bunch of criminals.

32:08.710 --> 32:11.630
What? No, I already
told you. No.

32:11.680 --> 32:11.930
[Jake]
Donny, shut up.

32:13.590 --> 32:16.220
If you want our help. You gotta
start being straight with us.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.190
[Donny] The plan was
to crash into a pole.

32:21.230 --> 32:23.440
Simple.
File an insurance claim.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.810
Get my money.
And that would be that.

32:24.860 --> 32:25.860
[Mal]
What's your connection to-

32:25.900 --> 32:26.150
Billy and Curtis?

32:27.780 --> 32:30.150
None. None. I never met either
one of them before the accident.

32:30.190 --> 32:32.450
And the next thing I know,
Curtis is at my house

32:32.490 --> 32:34.410
telling me to
stay away from Lydia.

32:34.450 --> 32:35.490
Stay away from Lydia.

32:35.530 --> 32:36.870
Why didn't you tell us that?

32:36.910 --> 32:37.200
I didn't trust you.

32:38.450 --> 32:39.120
I mean, obviously, you
were out to get me.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.500
Hey. Just got some preliminary
information from the Coroner.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.580
Curtis had broken bones all
over his body.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.960
- Everywhere.
- [Jake] From what?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
[Rose]
Numerous car crashes.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.210
He was a Derby Driver too.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.340
There's the second link.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.180
Lydia. She probably hired him

32:54.220 --> 32:55.800
to start the
accident in the first place.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.470
Lydia sets up the crash.
Hires the driver.

32:58.510 --> 32:58.850
Takes a cut on every end.

33:00.310 --> 33:01.980
No wonder she didn't want us
stumbling onto the truth?

33:02.020 --> 33:03.940
[Jake] You know what,
Donny? It's possible-

33:03.980 --> 33:06.520
You were just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.770
In the wrong accident. Yeah,
I've been saying that all along.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.530
And there's a chance you just
might get your settlement yet.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.360
And maybe you might get
your ten points.

33:13.820 --> 33:14.030
Dash cam.

33:15.530 --> 33:17.200
There's gotta be something on
it worth murdering for.

33:17.950 --> 33:18.240
[Jake]
Hey - Billy.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.540
He was driving towards me.
Remember he was flashing

33:21.580 --> 33:24.290
his lights. Maybe
if we get ahold

33:24.330 --> 33:24.500
of that dash-cam,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.630
Curtis could have been flashing
his lights the same way.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.300
Like a signal or something.

33:30.340 --> 33:31.760
I have it.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.550
You?

33:33.760 --> 33:34.930
I saw Curtis swipe it from
Billy's truck.

33:34.970 --> 33:36.760
And then when everybody split-

33:36.800 --> 33:38.600
I chased Curtis down.
And I took it from him.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.260
I knew those two were
up to something.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.890
I just didn't know what -

33:42.480 --> 33:44.310
Oh my, Donny.

33:44.350 --> 33:46.140
Mal. Come on.
Let's get him up.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.360
- [Donny] Where am I?
- You're in the Duke, honey.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.650
Oh my God. You were only
out for half a second.

33:50.690 --> 33:52.610
I'm not feeling so great.

33:52.650 --> 33:56.070
I took one of those
hot Sauna-cleanses.

33:56.110 --> 34:00.240
Plus I was electrocuted
today, I was.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.580
And I'm starting
to think that-

34:02.620 --> 34:04.200
the Universe is
a real Arsehole.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.580
- [phone rings]
- I'm gonna get this.

34:06.710 --> 34:07.790
[Rose] Why don't
you have a seat?

34:08.500 --> 34:08.920
What do you want?

34:10.130 --> 34:10.420
[Des] You gonna have
to come down here.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.960
I'm at the Police Station.
And Sloan needs a guardian.

34:14.010 --> 34:14.340
What did she do?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.590
It's not what you think.
She kinda did something good.

34:17.630 --> 34:20.300
But it was accidentally on
purpose. Just come down here.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.220
Okay. Okay.

34:24.350 --> 34:25.230
I think Sloan's in jail.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.020
I knew you guys weren't
telling me the whole truth.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.230
What's she got us into now?

34:29.270 --> 34:30.360
Honestly Rose.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.070
And this is
the truth.

34:32.650 --> 34:32.940
We have no idea.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.650
So would you just please cut
her a little slack?

34:35.690 --> 34:37.200
Seriously, Luv, we promise.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.700
Okay. I guess if you're
telling me the truth,

34:38.740 --> 34:39.120
I have to believe you.

34:40.570 --> 34:43.540
Let's go, Donny. Come on,
dear. You need to lie down.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.170
Go check on Sloan.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.540
I'll stay
on Donny.

34:58.590 --> 34:59.510
Donny?

35:00.550 --> 35:01.430
Donny.

35:03.640 --> 35:04.970
What did you do to my wife?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.350
I didn't do nothing,
I swear, Mal.

35:06.390 --> 35:07.270
- [bang]
- Arrgh!

35:10.940 --> 35:11.980
[Curtis] There's too
much money involved.

35:12.940 --> 35:13.230
You're messing
everything up.

35:14.690 --> 35:16.240
Just don't hurt them anymore.
I'll do what you want.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.030
I know you will.

35:18.110 --> 35:19.820
I also know you have
the dash-cam.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.530
Where is it?

35:23.120 --> 35:24.870
It's at the track. Okay?
It's at the track.

35:26.370 --> 35:28.160
We have a way of dealing with
things we no longer need-

35:28.750 --> 35:30.040
At the track.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.630
Come on!

35:31.670 --> 35:33.460
[Donny]
Whoa, sorry.

35:43.220 --> 35:43.600
♪♪♪♪♪

35:45.140 --> 35:45.720
[Tinny] I don't know how you
got tangled up in this.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.480
But you're on thin ice every
which way you seem to step.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.140
- Another lecture.
- Yes!

35:51.190 --> 35:52.850
- I'm not lecturing you.
- No lecture.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.900
I am telling you, that
if you weren't family,

35:54.940 --> 35:56.820
you'd be sitting with a much
less agreeable officer.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.440
And a lawyer.

35:59.280 --> 35:59.860
I get it.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.070
But I did help,
right?

36:03.490 --> 36:03.780
What's going on?

36:05.330 --> 36:06.790
[Tinny] Sloan got us a lead
on a guy who's using fabric

36:06.830 --> 36:08.870
to transport large
amounts of cocaine.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.620
And how did you do that,
exactly.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.670
We should leave
that conversation

36:14.710 --> 36:15.960
for outside of the law.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.300
Although you were
incredible baby.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.760
You were like bad cop versus
good cop rolled all into one.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.840
Sloan. You heard me, right?

36:22.890 --> 36:23.890
Yes.

36:26.430 --> 36:28.060
Please, please tell me that

36:28.100 --> 36:29.430
you're not involved
in anything illegal.

36:29.470 --> 36:31.020
I can't, in all honesty,
say that. No.

36:31.060 --> 36:33.100
Sloan. It was an accident.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.150
[phone rings]

36:37.020 --> 36:38.320
Typical.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.240
Do not go anywhere.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.570
The tow truck driver.

36:44.610 --> 36:44.910
Billy. Yeah, what about him?

36:46.080 --> 36:46.870
He drugged Rose and
he knocked me out.

36:47.740 --> 36:49.660
It's okay, Jake. We're fine.

36:49.700 --> 36:50.040
What?

36:51.080 --> 36:51.910
[Mal] Billy's gonna kill Donny

36:51.960 --> 36:52.830
to shut him up.

36:52.870 --> 36:54.000
He's taken him to the Derby.

36:54.040 --> 36:54.290
The dash cam.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.340
We gotta find the Dash cam
that Donny took.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.670
It incriminates Billy.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.720
Way ahead of you.

37:02.170 --> 37:03.630
I've got it.

37:08.050 --> 37:10.140
[Sloane] I guess this
means he forgives me?

37:12.680 --> 37:13.850
You're not allowed back
on active duty?

37:15.020 --> 37:16.610
I got a way to prove that
you're ready.

37:17.480 --> 37:17.820
What's going on?

37:18.860 --> 37:19.190
I think we can help
each other.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.690
Billy knows that the dash
cam's gonna send him to jail.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.700
Do you feel like
being a cop again?

37:24.740 --> 37:26.450
What's he doing here?

37:26.490 --> 37:28.070
All I need to do
is find a dash cam

37:28.120 --> 37:28.370
that will look
like the real one.

37:29.660 --> 37:31.410
And I'm pretty sure
he's swap Donny for it.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.500
And if anything goes wrong-

37:32.540 --> 37:33.620
You get shot.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.250
Not if we're there to stop it.

37:35.290 --> 37:37.500
Come on, Hood. You can keep
me out of trouble.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.380
What? Is that supposed to
be an incentive?

37:46.470 --> 37:47.390
Whoa.

37:47.430 --> 37:47.640
Just take it easy, okay.

37:48.890 --> 37:50.850
Let's not point the gun at
the man's head.

37:50.890 --> 37:52.390
This is what I
get for trying to be

37:52.430 --> 37:53.980
at one with crap in this world.

37:54.020 --> 37:55.190
Shut up.

37:55.230 --> 37:56.310
The cam. Where is it?

37:56.350 --> 37:59.110
I've got it. Okay? Here it is.

37:59.150 --> 38:00.070
I haven't watched it.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.730
Let alone make copies.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.070
I'm curious though,
what's on here?

38:03.110 --> 38:04.990
A sex tape with you
and Curtis?

38:05.030 --> 38:09.070
No. We filmed the accident to
make sure it was going to plan.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.910
I figured.
So the headlights.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.660
They were a signal. You were
supposed to clip Curtis.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.040
Exactly.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.370
And then this idiot shows up
and ruins the whole plan.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.040
I'm starting to get really,
really angry, Jake.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.050
Upset and angry.

38:22.090 --> 38:23.010
And sad.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.630
[gun cocks]

38:24.670 --> 38:25.590
Hand it over.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.840
Just take it easy, okay.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.260
Let him go.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.100
Alright. That's
about enough of that.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.970
Drop it. We got all that
confession recorded.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.390
[bang]

38:34.430 --> 38:35.350
Hood!

38:37.640 --> 38:38.650
This is your fault.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.400
What's this? I
felt like I was hit.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.650
There was rock
salt in the gun.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.320
[Hood]
Doyle!

38:48.820 --> 38:50.280
Doyle, what in the hell are
you doing?

38:50.320 --> 38:52.330
I hope this is loaded Donny.

38:55.910 --> 38:56.790

38:58.670 --> 38:59.540

39:02.460 --> 39:03.340
[crash]

39:10.180 --> 39:13.430
Davidson. This is the part
where I read you your rights.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.660
♪♪♪♪

39:31.700 --> 39:33.950
I owe you both.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.120
Insurance company had
to settle with me.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.080
So here's your ten percent.

39:42.540 --> 39:43.630
Thank you. Very generous.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.630
Well, Lydia's facing a
boatload of charges.

39:47.670 --> 39:50.970
And obviously Billy's gonna go
away for a long time as well.

39:51.010 --> 39:51.390
That's good.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.760
And know I'm gonna go burn
everything I have

39:54.800 --> 39:57.020
and own that was supposed to
bring me peace and harmony.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.350
You've gotta be yourself
in this world.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.230
Thank God he's gone.

40:17.330 --> 40:18.290
It'll be okay, son.

40:19.710 --> 40:20.870
Yeah.

40:20.910 --> 40:22.370
You need me with
you at Saul's?

40:22.420 --> 40:23.830
No. I'll be fine.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.550
Hi Jake.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.420
I'll leave you both to it.

40:32.340 --> 40:34.720
My God. You look beautiful.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.720
Oh, thank you.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.060
So-

40:38.100 --> 40:38.430
Are we talking again?

40:40.060 --> 40:43.020
Well Malachy. I can't stay mad
a cute little face like this.

40:44.480 --> 40:49.400
So, yes. But you're taking me
out for dinner. Oooh.

40:49.440 --> 40:50.530
Let's take it out
of Jake's half.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.070
Now that's why I love you.

40:58.410 --> 41:00.410
You said to meet me in an hour
three hours ago.

41:00.450 --> 41:02.620
Tardiness. You might
wanna watch that.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.830
So you kidnap my daughter?
That's a little extreme, no?

41:05.880 --> 41:06.500
Sloan, come here.

41:08.090 --> 41:11.050
You're daughter has an obsession
with messing in my business.

41:12.050 --> 41:13.180
Isn't that right,
little Sloan?

41:14.680 --> 41:14.930
What's he talking about?

41:16.260 --> 41:18.930
Okay, the guy I busted?
He was one of Saul's.

41:18.970 --> 41:20.390
Which I didn't know at the time,

41:20.430 --> 41:21.850
or I wouldn't have gone
anywhere near him.

41:21.890 --> 41:23.230
He was running a lot of
product. And now-

41:23.270 --> 41:24.440
He's in jail.

41:25.650 --> 41:26.730
Is that for me?

41:34.070 --> 41:34.360
Speak.

41:35.240 --> 41:35.700
The guy's in
real estate.

41:37.070 --> 41:39.530
He was selling Alisha a real
estate development.

41:39.580 --> 41:39.870
Something to do with a condo.

41:41.410 --> 41:44.620
Actually, he sold it to me.
Alisha facilitated the deal.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.710
To launder your-

41:45.750 --> 41:46.210
criminal proceeds.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.710
If you knew about this,
why was I following him?

41:49.750 --> 41:50.670
Let's just say I
okay the transaction,

41:51.710 --> 41:53.670
but I have trouble
trusting people.

41:54.590 --> 41:56.140
Can we keep Jake? I like him.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.470
[Jake] I've been running
around like an idiot

41:59.510 --> 42:01.140
I did what you wanted.
But Buddy.

42:01.180 --> 42:03.310
Do I have to remind you
what'll happen to you,

42:03.350 --> 42:05.310
if you go near my
daughter again?

42:05.350 --> 42:08.650
Look, for everyone's sake, keep
a leash on her and your temper.

42:09.820 --> 42:12.820
And bad things don't have
to happen. Okay?

42:14.150 --> 42:15.900
And this little prank of hers

42:15.950 --> 42:18.200
just dragged you even
deeper into my employ.

42:21.790 --> 42:22.870
It's okay.

42:22.910 --> 42:25.410
Just, go wait in the car.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.370
- What?
- Go. Please.

42:31.170 --> 42:33.670
Thank you for buying me
the time I needed.

42:35.590 --> 42:37.880
This mean that we're
friends now?

42:37.930 --> 42:40.180
Something like that.

42:40.220 --> 42:42.560
From now on,
you answer to me.

42:42.600 --> 42:46.060
And I promise - there's not
gonna be a dull moment.

42:46.890 --> 42:48.100
Keep your head up, Jake.
