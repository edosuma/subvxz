physical with you, Ms. Massey?

07:41.591 --> 07:43.506
Every time it happened,

07:43.550 --> 07:45.029
he said he would change.

But...

07:48.511 --> 07:50.687
Last night, it was bad.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.472
I had to go to the ER.

07:54.952 --> 07:58.173
Then this morning...

07:58.216 --> 08:00.131
He beat you again?

08:01.176 --> 08:02.743
No.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.834
He said he was sorry.

08:06.877 --> 08:09.314
Like always.

08:10.359 --> 08:13.580
But I just couldn't...

08:13.623 --> 08:16.147
I just couldn't do it anymore.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.975
So...

08:19.281 --> 08:21.979
I went, and I got the hammer,

08:22.023 --> 08:24.547
and when he wasn't looking,
I walked up behind him,

08:24.591 --> 08:27.681
and I hit him in the
back of the head.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.726
Very hard.DANNY:
Okay.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.815

Okay, so, so, so,
back home, right,

abuse cases, right?

08:53.271 --> 08:54.838

Uh, after a while,

08:54.882 --> 08:56.013
it starts to get
under your skin,

08:56.057 --> 08:57.145
so I did some research, right?

08:57.188 --> 08:58.233
Talked to a few people.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.713
There-There's a pattern.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.323
Nine times out of ten,
it goes like this.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.107
There's violence, right?

09:03.151 --> 09:04.500
Then there's an apology,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.502
and then there's a calm,
all right?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.069
The, uh, the abused,

09:08.112 --> 09:10.201
they, uh, they start
to think that things

09:10.245 --> 09:11.942
are maybe gonna get
a little better, right?

09:11.986 --> 09:13.509
Yeah, but they don't.Right.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.685
The point is this. It is...
it is almost impossible

09:15.729 --> 09:18.296
for people in these situations
to fight back.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.603
And when they do,
it is almost always

09:20.647 --> 09:22.083
in self-defense,
not premeditated

09:22.126 --> 09:23.824
like she was just explaining.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.826
I mean, if she didn't
do this, wh-why...

09:25.869 --> 09:27.262
why would she confess?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.220
That I do not know. Yet.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.353
Danny, I'm more than happy
to follow your lead here.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.746
But if she didn't do this,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.399
we have to figure out who
did and run them down,

09:34.443 --> 09:36.314
like, right now.
Otherwise, you know

09:36.358 --> 09:37.620
it's gonna look to the Thais
like we're just trying

09:37.664 --> 09:38.969
to protect a U.S. citizen

09:39.013 --> 09:41.189
from prosecution.I-I don't care
how it looks.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.407
Okay? Maybe I'm wrong,

09:42.451 --> 09:44.192
but I'm not.
She did not kill her husband.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.194
She's not a killer.
She's a victim.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.543
All right.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.937
Well, international
incident or not,

09:49.980 --> 09:53.070
if she didn't do this, we're not
gonna let her go down for it.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.255
Then he turned his back to me.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.170
Okay. And you were standing
how far away?

10:06.214 --> 10:07.911
Seven or eight feet.Seven or eight feet.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.130
And then-then what happened?

10:09.173 --> 10:10.740
I walked up behind him,

10:10.784 --> 10:12.655
and I hit him in the
back of the head.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.439
Detective, how many more times

10:14.483 --> 10:16.398
are you gonna go over
this? Because my story's

10:16.441 --> 10:18.966
not gonna change.See, that-that...
that's the problem.

10:19.009 --> 10:19.793
That's the problem.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.142
Okay?

10:21.185 --> 10:23.623
Your account is...

10:23.666 --> 10:26.147
is very detailed
and very consistent.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.583
More so than I would expect

10:27.627 --> 10:29.716
from someone who experienced
a significant trauma.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.718
So you think I'm lying?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.328
Yes, I do think you're lying.
I don't think

10:33.371 --> 10:34.677
you killed your husband.What?

10:34.721 --> 10:35.939
Yeah.
Why...

10:35.983 --> 10:37.637
would I lie about that?I don't know.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.247
I don't know. I think you're...
you're protecting someone.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.509
That's what I think.
No.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.119
No?
You're wrong.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.644
Okay, I'm wrong.
Well, I imagine this, okay?

10:44.687 --> 10:47.081
I imagine whoever
did this for you

10:47.124 --> 10:48.996
was protecting you, and now
you want to protect them.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.128
Which I understand.
I get that.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.565
Okay? But it is my job
to get to the bottom of this,

10:53.609 --> 10:54.784
and since I do not think
that you did it,

10:54.828 --> 10:56.351
that means keeping you
out of jail.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.309
I killed my husband, Detective,

10:58.353 --> 10:59.702
and that's the truth.Okay. Okay.

10:59.746 --> 11:00.964
STEVE:
Look, she is sticking
to her story.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.358
She still insists
that she killed him.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.273
Well, I got news
for both of you.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.014
All the evidence
at the crime scene

11:07.057 --> 11:08.102
agrees with her.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.538
QUINN:
No sign of forced entry.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.105
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.716
It all suggests Khomsiri
knew who his killer was.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.326
And then there's
the murder weapon.
The only prints we found

11:15.370 --> 11:17.328
on that hammer were Lorena's.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.374
Okay, okay, well, let's
just pretend I'm a detective

11:19.417 --> 11:20.984
for a second, okay?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.856
Why were her prints
the only ones on that hammer?

11:22.899 --> 11:24.335
Right? Her husband
never used the hammer?

11:24.379 --> 11:26.860
It's the family toolbox--
nobody else ever used it?

11:26.903 --> 11:28.688
Why only her prints?
I'll tell you why.

11:28.731 --> 11:29.863
Because she
wiped the thing down,

11:29.906 --> 11:31.081
and then she put
her prints on it.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.996
She is protecting someone.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.737
GROVER: Well,
that's got to be a short list.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.521
We went through
all her phone records

11:36.565 --> 11:38.088
and her financials.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.351
Listen, the girl
hardly went anyplace.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.397
And the only people she called
was a few people in Portland,

11:42.440 --> 11:43.485
which is where she's from.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.139
That makes
perfect sense to me.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.532
I mean, she-she's got
a controlling husband.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.099
Right? She's-she's dealing
with the shame

11:49.143 --> 11:51.232
from what's been going on--
I mean, there's a reason

11:51.275 --> 11:54.365
that abuse victims
end up feeling isolated.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.584
Check a... a boyfriend.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.194
Maybe she got
a boyfriend, right?

11:57.238 --> 11:58.761
I mean, those are calls
that she'd be trying to hide

11:58.805 --> 12:00.502
from her husband, right?STEVE: I agree.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.546
I'm with Danny
on this one.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.809
We need to dig
deeper, all right?

12:02.852 --> 12:03.940
Dump her computer.
Look for signs

12:03.984 --> 12:05.507
of a secret relationship.
anything.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.074
DANNY: And look, if we're
gonna prove that she's innocent,

12:07.117 --> 12:08.466
we got to find an alibi.

12:08.510 --> 12:11.078
Okay? And she's certainly
not gonna give us one.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.993
Okay, so the M.E.
ruled time of death

12:13.036 --> 12:14.559
somewhere between 8:15
and 8:30 a.am.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.647
Let's run her financials,

12:15.691 --> 12:17.867
see if we can recreate
her morning.

12:17.911 --> 12:21.001
Find something, someone,
anything to put her

12:21.044 --> 12:24.178
anywhere other than that house
when her husband was killed.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.442
CUNHA:
Thanks so much
for setting that up.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.704
Errol was fantastic.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.793
Did you like Errol?
'Cause I couldn't tell.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.186
"Oh, Errol!

12:32.229 --> 12:34.492
"Oh, you're such
a wonderful instructor.[giggles]

12:34.536 --> 12:35.711
Errol..."Come on.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.973
[both laugh]

12:41.064 --> 12:43.240
[phone chimes]

12:43.284 --> 12:46.156
Oh. Text from Adam.
We caught a case.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.376
Okay, um, I'm dying
for some water.

12:48.419 --> 12:51.074
Can we just stop in
the store real quick?Yeah. Sure.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.034
[electronic chime]

12:54.077 --> 12:56.036
Wow.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.995
God forbid we forget for one
second it's Valentine's Day.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.823
Seriously.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.782
You and Manti
have any plans?

13:02.825 --> 13:04.696
[sighs] No.
The team he coaches

13:04.740 --> 13:06.437
has a game on Maui.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.483
But he did promise
to make it up to me later.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.528
Well, he better, because
your new surf instructor

13:10.572 --> 13:12.922
is only a phone call away.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.358
[electronic chime]

13:18.928 --> 13:20.016
[electronic chime]

13:34.552 --> 13:36.163
GROVER:
So...

13:36.206 --> 13:39.166
the yoga studio
where Lorena goes

13:39.209 --> 13:41.298
said that she was in
class this morning,

13:41.342 --> 13:43.431
but her class
was done at 7:30.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.259
Well, that gives her more
than enough time to get home

13:45.302 --> 13:46.782
within the time-of-death window.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.566
GROVER:
Yeah. What you got on your end?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.873
Nothing.
Nobody saw her

13:50.917 --> 13:52.657
at the coffee shop
that she frequents

13:52.701 --> 13:53.658
or the bakery next door.

13:53.702 --> 13:54.659
I mean,
I even checked footage

13:54.703 --> 13:56.270
from the ATM cam
on her way home.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.141
You know what?
Maybe the reason

13:58.185 --> 13:59.664
that we can't establish

13:59.708 --> 14:02.537
an alibi for this woman
is because she did it.

14:02.580 --> 14:03.930
Think I got something, guys.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.453
That was HPD.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.194
They've been canvassing
Lorena's neighborhood.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.196
Nobody saw her come or go
from her house

14:09.239 --> 14:11.720
this morning, but someone did
say they saw her get picked up

14:11.763 --> 14:13.635
by a black Jaguar sedan

14:13.678 --> 14:15.680
last night
around 8:00 p.m.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.553
Well, she ran her credit card

14:18.596 --> 14:20.163
at the ER just after 9:00.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.035
That has to be
where the car took her.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.993
GROVER:
We don't have
any record

14:24.037 --> 14:25.516
of any phone calls
that she made.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.953
And I'm sure that

14:26.996 --> 14:29.259
you won't find a
Jaguar in rideshare.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.696
Well, whoever took her
to the ER,

14:31.740 --> 14:33.698
she trusted enough
to tell about the abuse.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.178
Maybe this is
that relationship

14:35.222 --> 14:37.006
Danny thinks she's been hiding.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.181
You're talking about
a relationship

14:38.225 --> 14:39.443
with no phone
calls or texts

14:39.487 --> 14:41.706
or e-mails or nothing
of the sort, right?

14:41.750 --> 14:44.535
How was she communicating
with this person?

14:44.579 --> 14:45.710
Smoke signals?

14:45.754 --> 14:47.364
You know, my niece has

14:47.408 --> 14:48.713
a secret app
on her phone

14:48.757 --> 14:50.498
that she uses to hide her texts

14:50.541 --> 14:52.195
and photos from her parents.

14:52.239 --> 14:55.546
Okay. So, here is
Lorena's phone dump.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.244
If we check out data usage,
it'll tell us

14:57.287 --> 14:58.898
how much time she spent
on each app.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.725
Look at this
calculator app.

15:00.769 --> 15:03.380
Who in the hell spends
three hours

15:03.424 --> 15:04.904
on their calculator?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.296
So, not actually a calculator.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.431
GROVER:
Wow.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.607
It looks like Danny was right.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.392
ADAM: Yeah. She was definitely
having an affair.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.872
These messages are

15:16.916 --> 15:18.700
very personal.QUINN:
Okay, guys,

15:18.743 --> 15:20.136
check out the message
from last night.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.529
Whoever she was messaging said,

15:21.572 --> 15:24.532
"You have to come to the ER
I'm picking you up."

15:24.575 --> 15:26.229
GROVER:
Wouldn't you say
you "have to go

15:26.273 --> 15:28.231
to the ER"?
That message

15:28.275 --> 15:30.059
implies whoever sent
it was already there.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.887
Maybe it was
a hospital employee.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.715
Hey, do we know

15:33.758 --> 15:35.630
who she was treated by
last night?

15:35.673 --> 15:37.153
It was a Dr. Ray Paulson.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.676
I called him last night to
check on her state of mind,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.983
but he was in surgery,
and I'm waiting for him

15:41.027 --> 15:42.028
to call me back.Run DMV on Paulson.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.380
Boom.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.947
Jaguar.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.557
Okay, this must be

15:49.600 --> 15:51.080
the person she's
protecting.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.690
QUINN:
Which means
Dr. Paulson

15:52.734 --> 15:55.998
might actually be the person
who killed our victim.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.131
You know what?
Who needs a boyfriend?

15:58.174 --> 16:00.655
I'll buy
my own damn chocolates.You know those are gonna

16:00.698 --> 16:01.699
go on sale
tomorrow, right?

16:01.743 --> 16:02.744
[electronic chime]

16:02.787 --> 16:04.964
Hey, you have my full support,

16:05.007 --> 16:05.747
especially if you're sharing.

16:08.402 --> 16:11.144
All right, everybody
down on the ground! Now!

16:11.187 --> 16:13.233
Get down! I said, get down!Let's go!

16:13.276 --> 16:15.104
Let's go! Move!Everything
in the bag.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.932
Let's go! Come on!

16:19.065 --> 16:20.631
There's only a few hundred.
Where's the rest?

16:20.675 --> 16:22.024
In the back, a safe.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.330
Forget it. Let's just go.No.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.636
We're getting what we came for.
Move! Let's go!

16:26.463 --> 16:27.595
TANI:
You see that?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.640
Yeah. He's unsteady,

16:29.684 --> 16:30.685
and his hand is twitching.

16:30.728 --> 16:31.816
TANI:
Probably tweaking-- came here

16:31.860 --> 16:33.035
looking for drug money.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.036
No. I don't think
that's what it is.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.646
[sirens approaching]

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
Hey! We got cops!

16:37.257 --> 16:38.388
You tripped the alarm?

16:38.432 --> 16:40.042
That's it,
we're screwed.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
No, we're not.
We've got hostages.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.002
They want
to keep them alive,

16:43.045 --> 16:43.959
they'll do what we say.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.272
Everybody give me your phone.
Let's go! Come on!

16:52.315 --> 16:53.490
Hurry up.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.883
Let's go.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.058
Let's go.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.668
Come on.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.062
OFFICER [over bullhorn]:
This is HPD.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.237
We have the store surrounded.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.499
[sirens wailing]

17:02.543 --> 17:05.241
Lock the front door. Now!

17:05.285 --> 17:06.808
No one needs to get hurt here.

17:06.851 --> 17:10.464
So step outside,
with your hands above your head,

17:10.507 --> 17:12.161
and let's resolve this
peacefully.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.597
What the hell
are we gonna do now?

17:13.641 --> 17:15.208
Hey. Look at me.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.992
Just breathe.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.776
Mm.
We'll figure it out.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.909
We're in this
together, okay?

17:20.952 --> 17:21.692
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

17:23.868 --> 17:25.392
Got a regular Bonnie
and Clyde here.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.611
Yeah, well, at least he's
keeping her from going postal.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.091
TANI:
For now.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.397
They're amateurs.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.572
That's not a
good thing.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.269
They're in way over their head.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.663
Okay, so, um,

17:35.706 --> 17:38.361
we, um, picked up
Dr. Paulson.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.667
You know, the ER doctor
who took you

17:39.710 --> 17:40.885
to the hospital last night.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.017
We also found out
that he's probably

17:42.061 --> 17:43.366
a little bit more
than just a doctor.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.412
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:45.455 --> 17:48.893
Over 6,500 messages
between you and this woman

17:48.937 --> 17:50.417
over the last few months.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.853
You got anything to say
about that?

17:51.896 --> 17:53.594
I admit, we've grown close.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.249
I care about Lorena very much.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.469
But she's a patient, and
a married one at that.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.602
Which is why it never
became physical.

18:01.645 --> 18:02.907
Let me stop you right there.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.605
Let me tell you
what that statement says to me.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.999
It says to me that if Lorena was
to suddenly become unmarried--

18:08.043 --> 18:09.262
for example,
if something were to happen

18:09.305 --> 18:11.568
to that son of a bitch
husband of hers--

18:11.612 --> 18:13.396
oh, that'd be just fine
with you.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.789
I told you, I didn't kill him.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.486
Yeah, and what
about this love note

18:16.530 --> 18:18.532
that you sent to her last night.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.274
"If he hurts you again,

18:21.317 --> 18:24.190
"it'll be the last thing...

18:24.233 --> 18:26.322
he does."

18:26.366 --> 18:27.932
DANNY:
I don't understand.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.717
You sacrifice so much
for this one guy.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.979
Now you're gonna sacrifice
for this doctor?

18:31.022 --> 18:32.328
What about you?
What about you?

18:32.372 --> 18:34.156
When are you gonna start
taking care of yourself?

18:34.200 --> 18:37.986
Do you know what it's
like to feel invisible?

18:38.029 --> 18:41.032
Every day Prin looked through
me like I didn't exist,

18:41.076 --> 18:43.209
to the point where I started
to think that maybe I didn't.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.386
And then someone comes along
who really sees me.

18:46.429 --> 18:47.865
Okay. I get it.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.520
Is it worth going to jail
for the rest of your life?

18:50.564 --> 18:52.653
Have you never sacrificed
anything for love, Detective?

18:52.696 --> 18:54.481
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I have.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.917
I know what that's like.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.614
I moved all the way out here
for my daughter.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.356
That's a 5,000-mile sacrifice,
but I didn't have a choice.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.010
Exactly.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.838
Sometimes you don't.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.666
GROVER:
Let me tell you something.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.102
This woman you wanted
so badly to protect,

19:07.146 --> 19:08.451
you know where
she is right now?

19:08.495 --> 19:11.106
She's in custody.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.934
Why?

19:12.977 --> 19:14.588
'Cause she confessed

19:14.631 --> 19:15.937
to your crime.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.417
She what?

19:17.460 --> 19:18.548
You heard me.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.246
She confessed

19:20.289 --> 19:21.682
to the murder
you committed,

19:21.725 --> 19:23.249
which means she's
pretty crazy about you,

19:23.292 --> 19:25.729
or she's just pretty damn crazy.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.036
[door opens]

19:28.079 --> 19:30.691
Lou.
There's been a development.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.432
You have a choice,
and that's what I'm saying.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.303
We can go back and forth

19:34.347 --> 19:36.305
[phone beeps]about the sacrifice, but...
Excuse me.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.792
What is it?Um...

19:44.835 --> 19:46.881
I've just been informed
that, um,

19:46.924 --> 19:48.883
Dr. Paulson did not...

19:48.926 --> 19:50.667
kill your husband.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.669
We have him on camera
at a gas station

19:52.713 --> 19:54.367
on the other side
of the Island

19:54.410 --> 19:56.238
at the time of death.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.587
Which means...

19:57.631 --> 20:00.416
you are covering
for the wrong person.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.853
I think you'd agree

20:02.897 --> 20:05.769
this changes everything, no?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.249
So what you need to do is

20:07.293 --> 20:08.468
just drop the act altogether.
That thing's off.

20:08.511 --> 20:09.817
Just talk to me, okay?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.340
I need the truth.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.473
Please, just talk to me
and tell me the truth.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.214
Was your husband dead
when you got home?

20:19.130 --> 20:22.003
I thought for sure
Ray must have done it.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.787
The things he was
saying last night

20:23.831 --> 20:25.136
when he drove me
to the hospital--

20:25.180 --> 20:26.964
he was so angry.Mm-hmm.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.488
And then when I found
my husband dead

20:28.531 --> 20:29.750
and I couldn't reach Ray

20:29.793 --> 20:31.882
on the app, I...
I knew that if I called

20:31.926 --> 20:33.362
or if I texted,

20:33.406 --> 20:35.277
then I would lead police
straight to him.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.409
So I...

20:39.716 --> 20:41.109
I said I did it...Okay.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.284
to protect him, not...

20:42.328 --> 20:44.155
Uh, it-it's...

20:44.199 --> 20:45.505
doesn't matter now.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.420
Please.
I sw-I swear,

20:47.463 --> 20:49.509
I-I don't know
who did this.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.206
If it wasn't Ray, I...

20:51.250 --> 20:52.599
I don't know.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.165
I can't go to jail.
I...

20:54.209 --> 20:55.776
I'm not gonna
let you go to jail, okay?

20:55.819 --> 20:56.777
I'm gonna do my best
to keep you out of jail,

20:56.820 --> 20:57.995
but I got a problem.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.519
All the evidence
at that crime scene

20:59.562 --> 21:00.868
supports your confession.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.174
So I got to find the killer,
the actual killer,

21:03.218 --> 21:04.915
now, and I got to do it fast,
and you got to help me.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.613
Can you...
Just calm down, please.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.049
Can you help me?

21:08.092 --> 21:09.746
Okay.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.095
What are we gonna do?

21:11.139 --> 21:12.836
The cops aren't just
gonna wait out there.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.055
We need a plan!

21:14.098 --> 21:15.099
[wheezing]

21:15.143 --> 21:16.449
I can't breathe.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.972
No, it's okay.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.147
I can't breathe!It's okay.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.975
She's-she's having
an asthma attack.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.890
Her inhaler is in the
car. She needs it now.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.761
Please!
She could die.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.849
You have that
kind of thing

21:25.893 --> 21:27.329
in here?Down the end of that aisle.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.505
Hey.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.072
We don't need
someone dying.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.119
All right.
Come with me. Let's go!

21:43.214 --> 21:45.521
[grunting]

21:45.565 --> 21:46.870
[groans, sighs]

21:46.914 --> 21:49.133
[quietly]:
Not a sound. Understand?

21:50.309 --> 21:51.440
[wheezing]Let's go.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.529
Hurry!I can't.

21:53.573 --> 21:54.922
Can you help me?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.445
[panting]

21:56.489 --> 21:57.490
Now!

21:57.533 --> 21:59.143
[grunting]

22:04.453 --> 22:05.846
Give...

22:05.889 --> 22:07.326
my husband back...

22:07.369 --> 22:08.327
his gun.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.719
Do it.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.025
Now!

22:15.421 --> 22:16.552
Let's go.

22:16.596 --> 22:17.945
Get over there.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.557
Look, if our victim
wasn't killed by the doctor,

22:21.601 --> 22:23.037
we got to find other motives.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.386
Danny spoke to Lorena

22:24.430 --> 22:26.388
and he asked her
about Khomsiri's work.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.868
If there was anything there

22:27.911 --> 22:30.044
that he could find that
would make Khomsiri a target.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.393
But it doesn't look like
she's gonna be much help.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.960
I mean, this guy kept her
in the dark on everything.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.222
ADAM:
Okay.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.745
We're digging
into his work life now.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.444
Also, there's an update
from CSU.

22:38.487 --> 22:41.403
They found something odd at
the crime scene: a flower petal,

22:41.447 --> 22:43.057
just inside the door,
that doesn't match anything

22:43.100 --> 22:44.580
in the bouquet
Lorena received

22:44.624 --> 22:46.234
this morning.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.192
What, somebody shows up to
the house, and then leaves again

22:48.236 --> 22:49.455
with a bunch of flowers.
I don't understand.

22:49.498 --> 22:50.847
Doesn't make sense.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.545
Well, actually, it might.

22:52.588 --> 22:53.894
I mean, Khomsiri

22:53.937 --> 22:55.461
was driven to and from work

22:55.504 --> 22:57.332
every day
by an armed guard, right?

22:57.376 --> 22:59.595
So the only time
he was vulnerable was

22:59.639 --> 23:01.380
when he was at home.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.731
Okay, so if you're somebody who
rings doorbells for a living,

23:04.774 --> 23:06.385
somebody who would blend in...

23:06.428 --> 23:08.952
Like a flower delivery
guy on Valentine's Day.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.215
It would explain why there was
no signs of forced entry.

23:11.259 --> 23:12.869
He let his killer in.

23:12.913 --> 23:16.438
Quinn, have HPD send a couple
officers back down to that area

23:16.482 --> 23:18.440
and have them ask around
and see if anybody noticed

23:18.484 --> 23:20.442
a delivery guy leaving that
house this morning with a bunch

23:20.486 --> 23:21.617
of flowers.

23:21.661 --> 23:22.836
On it, Commander.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.011
Oh, hey,
have you heard from Tani?

23:24.054 --> 23:26.448
She texted she was heading in
a while ago.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.319
Now, she's not responding.
I'm starting to worry.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.670
No, I haven't, but
I can handle this

23:30.713 --> 23:32.715
if you want to stay and see
if you can track her down.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.282
Yeah, okay.
Her phone's still on.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.937
I'll see if I can get
a location off it.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.332
Steve?Hey.

23:41.376 --> 23:44.945
Under Secretary Yang from the
State Department is here again.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.163
And she's brought someone
with her.Mm-hmm.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.556
An attaché
from the Thai consulate.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.645
What's she want--
updates or something?

23:49.689 --> 23:51.255
No, she wants Lorena,

23:51.299 --> 23:53.083
so they can take her
to Thailand for prosecution.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.259
What are you talking about?
I mean, the woman's innocent,

23:55.303 --> 23:56.870
not to mention,
she's an American.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.437
They can't just throw her
in a cell in Bangkok.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.961
I told 'em that,
but then they showed me this.

24:04.617 --> 24:07.533
Why didn't you tell me
you renounced your citizenship?

24:07.576 --> 24:09.273
Because I didn't.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.235
I've never seen
these papers before.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.758
Prin must have
forged them.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.326
Another way to control me to
make sure I wouldn't leave.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.197
These are official documents.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.982
Lorena, this right here--
this is an official seal,

24:22.025 --> 24:23.200
which means
we're in real trouble.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.507
They want to put you
on a plane to Thailand,

24:25.551 --> 24:26.552
and, legally, because of this,

24:26.595 --> 24:27.683
there's not much
we can do about it.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.687
You can't let them take me.
You have no idea

24:31.731 --> 24:34.647
how powerful this family is.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.475
[phone ringing]

24:38.520 --> 24:40.696
TANI:
That's the hostage
negotiator calling.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.177
You have to
talk to them.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.961
If you don't, they'll take
it to mean that something's

24:45.005 --> 24:47.529
gone very, very bad in here.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.357
They will breach.
If they do that,

24:49.400 --> 24:50.750
one of you or both
will end up dead.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.752
Shut up, will you?

24:52.795 --> 24:54.057
Just listen to me.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.712
I'm a cop, okay?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.279
I know what I'm talking about.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.411
We have a cop in here?

25:00.455 --> 25:02.457
I'm so sorry.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.720
I should've listened to you.
We did all this

25:04.764 --> 25:05.939
for nothing.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.027
No, calm down.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.377
It wasn't for...

25:09.420 --> 25:11.205
No.Baby.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.686
Baby? Oh, my God.[groaning]

25:13.729 --> 25:16.602
Oh, my God,
he's having a seizure!Untie me. I can help him.

25:16.645 --> 25:17.864
Baby... Yeah, right.
Like I trust you.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.343
I'm a doctor, okay?

25:19.387 --> 25:20.693
If he's having a seizure,
you need

25:20.736 --> 25:22.564
to roll him
onto one side so that

25:22.608 --> 25:24.044
his airways
are clear.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.828
If it is a
cardiovascular incident,

25:25.872 --> 25:27.917
he's going
to need immediate CPR.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.832
Do you know how to perform CPR?

25:29.876 --> 25:32.052
[groaning]

25:33.270 --> 25:34.924
This better not be
another one

25:34.968 --> 25:36.491
of your stupid games.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.406
[groaning continues]

25:38.449 --> 25:40.843
If you try anything, I will

25:40.887 --> 25:42.541
put a bullet
in your friend's head.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.895
It's okay, baby.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.940
It's okay.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.511
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you take her.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.121
Commander, you're interfering
with orders from

25:58.165 --> 25:59.209
the secretary
of state himself.

25:59.253 --> 26:00.689
The honorary vice consul

26:00.733 --> 26:02.735
from the Kingdom of Thailand
has requested

26:02.778 --> 26:05.520
we turn over Mr. Khomsiri's
wife to stand trial

26:05.564 --> 26:08.436
for his murder, and
we have granted that request.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.829
Well, you shouldn't have
granted that request,

26:09.872 --> 26:11.221
'cause she didn't do it.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.006
Don't you want to bring
Mr. Khomsiri's killer

26:13.049 --> 26:14.529
to justice?
Isn't that

26:14.573 --> 26:17.010
what this is all about--
his real killer?

26:17.053 --> 26:18.533
Khomsiri's wife
already confessed.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.143
First of all,
she has a name, all right?

26:20.187 --> 26:21.754
Her name is
Lorena Massey.

26:21.797 --> 26:25.322
And second of all,
she recanted her confession.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.720
Massey is no longer
an American citizen,

26:31.764 --> 26:34.201
which means this
is not just out of

26:34.244 --> 26:36.638
your jurisdiction.
It's out of ours, as well.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.728
Now, for the last time,
step aside.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.948
You want her that bad, huh?

26:41.991 --> 26:44.254
Go get her.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.214
Thank you.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.260
Of course...

26:52.480 --> 26:54.221
...you're gonna have
to find her first.

26:56.397 --> 26:57.790
[truck engine starting]

27:11.891 --> 27:14.110
What's gonna happen to me,
Detective?

27:14.154 --> 27:16.112
It's-it's Danny, and
you're gonna be fine.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.637
Okay? I'm promise you,
you're gonna be fine.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.464
Five-O's gonna
get to the bottom of this.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.292
We just need
to keep you off grid

27:22.336 --> 27:23.990
for a little bit.
That's all.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.209
You're putting a lot
on the line for me.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.430
Why?

27:30.910 --> 27:33.652
I don't know.
I guess, uh,

27:33.695 --> 27:35.697
my life's not making
a lot of sense lately,

27:35.741 --> 27:37.786
so maybe I just want to
make sense of something.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.180
Your fake confession
was a puzzle

27:40.223 --> 27:41.572
that I thought I could solve.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.574
And you seem

27:43.618 --> 27:44.837
like a nice person.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.492
[brakes squeal]

27:48.536 --> 27:49.842
[truck door rolls open]

28:04.291 --> 28:06.989
Aloha, outlaws.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.861
Welcome to my safehouse
away from home.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.126
The seizures started
a few weeks ago.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.605
The doctor prescribed
epilepsy medication,

28:14.649 --> 28:15.694
but it's just gotten worse.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.739
Did you let the doctor know?

28:17.783 --> 28:20.350
Yeah. She said
we needed a full workup.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.830
Blood tests, MRIs.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.353
That's why you did this.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.095
'Cause you couldn't
afford the tests?

28:27.967 --> 28:31.274
Has he shown any other
symptoms-- headaches, nausea?

28:31.318 --> 28:33.537
Both.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.931
And he's, like,
losing his balance,

28:35.975 --> 28:37.759
tripping over things.

28:37.803 --> 28:38.978
Okay, well,

28:39.021 --> 28:40.196
I can't tell

28:40.240 --> 28:41.458
without running tests, but

28:41.502 --> 28:43.156
it sounds like BTRE,

28:43.199 --> 28:44.897
brain tumor-related epilepsy.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.681
He has a tumor?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.552
He most likely will need
surgery, but right now,

28:48.596 --> 28:51.164
he needs oxygen badly.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.775
Do you hear how ragged
his breathing is? Look,

28:53.819 --> 28:55.777
I'm sure there are EMTs outside.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.083
If you just let me
take him there...

28:57.126 --> 28:58.258
Out there?

28:58.301 --> 28:59.825
No.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.348
No way.

29:01.391 --> 29:04.046
At least just let her
go to the ambulance

29:04.090 --> 29:05.439
and bring one back.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.312
How do I know I can trust you

29:09.356 --> 29:11.880
and you won't just
bring the cops back in?

29:11.924 --> 29:13.926
I just want to
help your husband.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.884
Okay?

29:15.928 --> 29:18.408
I promise to come back alone.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.628
You have my word.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.766
Hey, Adam Noshimuri. Five-O.
You in charge?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.898
That's right.Now, let me take a look.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.858
What's going on?

29:32.901 --> 29:35.599
Looks like we got two
armed suspects, six civilians.

29:35.643 --> 29:39.516
No shots fired. As far
as we know, no casualties.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.170
All right, listen,
I'm pretty sure

29:41.214 --> 29:43.042
a friend of mine is
in there, maybe two.

29:43.085 --> 29:44.565
Have these guys
made any demands?

29:44.608 --> 29:46.393
We haven't been able
to make contact.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.569
We've been calling the store's
landline, but no answer.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.658
Well, that's not good.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.836
This is Dr. Noelani
Cunha coming out.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.968
I'm one of
the hostages.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.796
Hold your fire.

29:57.839 --> 29:58.840
Hold your fire, everyone.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.102
You, on me.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.712
Hey, hey.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.453
Hey, Noelani,
are you all right?

30:03.497 --> 30:04.759
How's Tani?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.065
She's fine.
Nobody's been hurt.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.544
But one of the robbers
needs medical attention.

30:07.588 --> 30:08.850
I came out for supplies.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.112
Aoki.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.940
Get a uniform from
one of the EMTs.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.550
I'm sending you in with her.No, no, no, no,

30:13.594 --> 30:15.161
I promised I'd go
back in there alone.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.902
Sending you in one of my team
is our best chance

30:16.945 --> 30:18.120
at a resolution here.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.035
Listen, she's panicked,
okay? On edge.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.732
If I go back in
there with anyone,

30:21.776 --> 30:22.951
I'm afraid of what
she might do.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.300
Sorry, ma'am.
This isn't your call.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.433
Listen, all due
respect, Sergeant,

30:26.476 --> 30:28.652
Dr. Cunha's been in close
quarters with these people

30:28.696 --> 30:30.741
for several hours now, and
you can't even get them

30:30.785 --> 30:31.742
on the phone,
all right?

30:31.786 --> 30:33.483
If anyone is qualified

30:33.527 --> 30:35.834
to speak to the hostage-taker's
state of mind, it's her.

30:37.661 --> 30:38.967
Yo, Danny.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.013
Text for you.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.799
Please just don't
get too chatty.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.888
It's ten cents a pop.Uh-huh.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.332
Hey, you take a look
at something?

30:56.376 --> 30:58.508
This guy-- he was seen

30:58.552 --> 31:01.685
coming out of your house
this morning, uh, carrying

31:01.729 --> 31:03.818
a floral arrangement.
You ever seen him before?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.212
I don't think so.No?

31:06.255 --> 31:09.041
What about, uh-- I don't know--
anywhere else?

31:09.084 --> 31:11.870
Maybe a work function
with your husband, something?

31:13.523 --> 31:15.961
I'm sorry. I want
to help. It's just...

31:17.832 --> 31:19.834
...I didn't know much
about Prin's life.Right.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.705
He never had people over.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.882
He never took me with
him to work dinners

31:23.925 --> 31:25.884
or on trips,
so, I don't...

31:25.927 --> 31:27.842
I don't understand

31:27.886 --> 31:30.062
how you ended up
with a guy like that.

31:31.063 --> 31:33.500
It wasn't always like that.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.502
Not when we first met.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.678
I was visiting from Portland.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.506
We ended up at the same luau.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.682
He was...

31:41.725 --> 31:43.466
charming, funny.

31:43.510 --> 31:47.035
Completely swept
me off my feet.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.559
Couple months later, I
moved here to be with him.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.910
Prin used to say
it was fate.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.478
He relocated to Oahu
only three weeks

31:55.522 --> 31:57.089
before that luau.

31:57.132 --> 32:00.396
So if his post in Mumbai
hadn't been cut short,

32:00.440 --> 32:02.094
we never would've met.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.531
Why, uh...

32:04.574 --> 32:06.185
why was it cut short?

32:06.228 --> 32:08.448
He'd been there eight months

32:08.491 --> 32:10.276
before he asked
to be reassigned.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.278
Why-why... why did he ask?

32:12.321 --> 32:14.845
Because he said
Mumbai was too hot.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.891
Uh-huh.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.198
Too hot?

32:19.241 --> 32:20.590
Since when the hell do
diplomats get to choose

32:20.634 --> 32:22.244
their assignments
based on the weather?

32:22.288 --> 32:23.898
Not to mention,
asking out

32:23.942 --> 32:26.509
of Mumbai is kind of
a weird career move.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.381
Wouldn't you say? I mean,
India is supposed to be

32:28.424 --> 32:30.470
one of Thailand's
most important allies.

32:30.513 --> 32:33.299
Right. Moving to Hawaii was a
serious step down for this guy.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.300
All right, look,
we've been running

32:34.343 --> 32:35.866
this sketch of our suspect

32:35.910 --> 32:37.825
through facial rec
and the databases

32:37.868 --> 32:39.696
from countries
that Khomsiri was stationed in.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.002
Let's hone in on Mumbai.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.612
All right.
Al-Also check,

32:42.656 --> 32:44.266
uh, local papers,
incident reports.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.268
I mean, this guy
was running from something.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.183
[door chimes]It's just me.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.141
No cops.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.060
All right,
this is midazolam.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.279
It'll prevent seizures,
but only temporarily.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.846
He really needs
to get to a hospital.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.935
[wheezing]

33:04.721 --> 33:06.027
Hey.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.507
I know
what you're thinking.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.030
You don't want
to go to prison.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.510
I'm not scared
of going to prison.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.164
I just...

33:13.469 --> 33:16.081
...can't be without him.

33:19.823 --> 33:22.043
But you heard her.
He's gonna need surgery.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.436
We could never
afford that.

33:23.479 --> 33:24.785
You don't have to.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.613
If you turn yourselves in,

33:26.656 --> 33:28.615
prisoners get mandatory
medical attention.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.138
He's gonna get the treatment
that he needs.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.707
Listen,
nobody goes

33:33.750 --> 33:35.187
through life alone.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.405
Everybody needs
someone to lean on.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.407
And in your case,
it's your husband.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.366
Look at him
right now.

33:40.409 --> 33:41.715
He can't be there for you.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.369
But maybe I can.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.848
How?

33:44.892 --> 33:46.154
I'll talk to the judge

33:46.198 --> 33:48.374
at your sentencing.
When I tell them

33:48.417 --> 33:50.637
why you did the things
that you did,

33:50.680 --> 33:52.204
they might go easier on you.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.076
You would do that for me?

33:55.120 --> 33:56.469
I would.

33:56.512 --> 33:59.037
If you end this now,
before anyone gets hurt.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.791
♪

34:32.331 --> 34:33.549
Hey. Hey.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.073
So, listen,
your hunch about India--

34:35.116 --> 34:36.465
you were right.

34:36.509 --> 34:37.814
A week before Khomsiri
was reassigned,

34:37.858 --> 34:39.207
there was an incident.

34:39.251 --> 34:40.687
Okay.
What was the incident?

34:40.730 --> 34:41.949
I don't know.
File's been sealed.

34:41.992 --> 34:42.906
I'm trying
to call in some favors.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.125
So far, nothing.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.258
Cuz, three SUVs
coming up the road.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.042
What? How possible?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.739
No one knows this place.

34:49.783 --> 34:52.046
Steve, I got to go.Danny. Danny.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.048
Hey. Come on,
come on, come on.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.005
We got to go.Okay.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.145
Stop right there!

35:06.191 --> 35:07.844
Keep your hands
where they are.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.242
Cuff 'em both.

35:14.286 --> 35:15.852
Turn around.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.954
How'd you get me out so fast?

35:30.998 --> 35:32.956
Well, the State Department
wanted to keep it quiet.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.263
And, uh, I may
have promised Yang

35:35.307 --> 35:36.699
that if she didn't release you
immediately,

35:36.743 --> 35:38.092
I was gonna make
a whole lot of noise.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.007
[sighs, stammers]

35:40.050 --> 35:42.096
Did they mention, uh,
how they found us?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.706
They tracked the phone.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.447
Tracked the phone?
I was on a burner.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.449
Prepaid.
Kamekona's cousin's phone.

35:47.493 --> 35:48.624
They weren't up on the burner,
Danny.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.148
They were up on HQ.

35:50.191 --> 35:50.887
On the
secure line.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.062
Which is...

35:52.106 --> 35:53.847
kind of terrifying to me.

35:53.890 --> 35:54.935
All right. Well, what's-what's
gonna happen with Lorena?

35:54.978 --> 35:56.458
What's going on?

35:56.502 --> 35:57.764
Lorena's on the way
to the airport.[phone ringing]

35:57.807 --> 35:59.548
Yang is gonna put her
on a plane to Thailand.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.811
Well, we can't let that happen.I know that, Danny.

36:01.855 --> 36:03.900
Lou, hey. You got me and Danny.
I just got him out.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.641
Go ahead.Well, I'm happy to report

36:05.685 --> 36:07.382
that we just unsealed
the victim's

36:07.426 --> 36:08.644
India file.

36:08.688 --> 36:11.081
Turns out our dead
diplomat took advantage

36:11.125 --> 36:13.388
of his immunity to get away
with all sorts of shady stuff.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.782
The worst of which:
he struck and killed a woman

36:15.825 --> 36:17.827
while he was driving drunk.Really?

36:17.871 --> 36:20.395
Local authorities arrested him,
but due

36:20.439 --> 36:22.005
to his diplomatic status,

36:22.049 --> 36:23.746
he ended up getting
off scot-free,

36:23.790 --> 36:26.488
and they swept the whole
damn thing under the rug.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.229
So he wasn't transferred
because of the weather.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.013
Yeah, I'm thinking somebody
back there wasn't willing

36:30.057 --> 36:31.667
to let him get away
with what he did.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.408
Hey, listen, Quinn,
do me a favor.

36:33.452 --> 36:36.063
Run a, uh... a quick search
on the DUI victim's name,

36:36.106 --> 36:38.370
please.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.071
Okay, looks like
we have ourselves a perp.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.855
It's the victim's
husband.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.206
His name is Sameer Khatri.
