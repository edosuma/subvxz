WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:04.504
Then my wife bought a TV recorder

00:04.588 --> 00:07.340
so she could fast-forward
past the commercials.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.758
Well, l like commercials.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.802
They tell me what to buy.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.012
l'd tell you to buy another TV, Ed,

00:13.097 --> 00:14.305
but l guess you wouldn't know
which one to get

00:14.390 --> 00:16.140
since you haven't seen the commercials.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.477
l don't know what's new,
l don't know what's improved,

00:19.561 --> 00:21.729
l don't know what's for a limited time only...

00:21.814 --> 00:24.440
Your days on this planet. Can we move on?

00:26.318 --> 00:27.985
You don't need the commercials, Ed.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.278
l think there's more underneath this.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.781
All fascinating stuff.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.492
l showed Russell Brand
1 00 pairs of skinny jeans today.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.119
He ends up buying jeggings.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.453
Can l talk now?

00:39.248 --> 00:40.665
Hold that thought, Patrick.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.500
Ed, what do you think is really
underneath your anger?

00:42.584 --> 00:46.337
Yeah, Ed, say it. Get it out. Get mad. Yell.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.842
Nolan, just because you vicariously
enjoy other people's anger

00:50.926 --> 00:52.760
doesn't mean you should prod them.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.845
l'm sorry.

00:59.435 --> 01:00.768
Also, you're not invisible.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.733
l think we all know what Ed's
really angry about.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.736
Just get to the brown people, old man.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.446
lt's always about the brown people.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.490
lt's not about the brown people, brown girl.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.368
l just like commercials.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.788
l've cried twice in the last 20 years.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.874
One of them was about a commercial.

01:22.958 --> 01:26.294
lt was the one with those puppies
and that Chinese kid.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.465
l don't know whether they were trying
to sell the puppies or the Chinese kid.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.386
But if that one don't get to you,
you're a freakin' robot.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.598
Hey, he fooled us. He went yellow people.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.266
No, no, no, no. This is good.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.518
Ed is finally expressing some vulnerability.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.896
lt's peppered with racism,

01:45.814 --> 01:47.857
but therapy is a marathon, not a sprint.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.985
Well, either way,
some kid from Kenya is going to win it.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.656
Are you done? Good. Fine. My turn.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.493
Sorry, Patrick.
We're going to have to call it a day.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.286
-Great session, gang.
-What?

02:03.540 --> 02:07.668
Well, we certainly learned a lot
about Ed today, didn't we?

02:08.337 --> 02:10.087
That's the nature of group.
Next time, it will be your turn.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.923
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't need to talk about me.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.800
After all, there is no "l" in "therapy."

02:14.259 --> 02:17.178
There's just a "Y," as in "Why do l bother?"

02:18.847 --> 02:20.932
Because of the "P," which stands for
the progress you're making,

02:21.016 --> 02:24.018
and the "H," which stands for,
"Hey, l'll see you next week."

02:25.562 --> 02:26.938
Hey, Dad.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.022
Hi.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.607
Am l allowed to say hi to him?

02:29.691 --> 02:32.193
No, no, just ignore me.
That's what we're doing today.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.617
Sorry, Charlie.
l should have brought Sam in the back door.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.786
l forgot you were doing group
at your house.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.871
You know, they look just like regular people.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.290
So do you.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.126
By the way, you owe me 20 bucks.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.211
For what?

02:50.295 --> 02:53.422
That's your half of the SAT
prep books we just bought for Sam.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.008
SAT prep books?

02:56.677 --> 02:59.136
You're in middle school. You don't
take that test for another four years.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.180
The competition is unreal.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.976
l read that Asian-Americans only make up
5.6% of the population,

03:05.060 --> 03:08.729
but they make up 25% of the kids
in the top 1 0 schools.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.398
Do you know how many times
more likely they are

03:10.482 --> 03:12.400
to get into a good school than l am?

03:12.568 --> 03:14.777
No, but if l were an Asian kid,
l could probably figure it out.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.074
Look, you want to stand out?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.785
Get some extracurricular activities.
Start a club.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.954
Yeah, l was in a club in high school.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.789
Smoking in the bathroom is not a club.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.959
The vice-principal said it was a club.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.627
He should know. He was there.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.090
l have an idea.
What about a college prep club?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.009
You and the rest of your nerd army
can get together

03:38.093 --> 03:40.761
and talk about all the tests,
the applications, the personal essays.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.054
Personal essays?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.806
What am l going to write about?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.474
The worst thing that has
happened to me is your divorce,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.310
and you guys insist on getting along.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.607
Listen, kiddo. Everything is gonna be fine.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.317
When the time comes,
you're going to be totally prepared

03:54.401 --> 03:55.484
to do what you need to do.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.986
You really think so?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.946
Nah. lt's just a load of crap
my dad laid on me.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.033
Now l'm passing it on to you.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.246
Sam, you forgot a book.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.916
Oh, no, no, no, no. That's okay.
l'll give it to her.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.459
Give it to me.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.505
Sabrina's Satin Surrender.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.091
This is yours, isn't it?

04:19.843 --> 04:23.638
lt's a historical novel set against
the backdrop of the Civil War.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.266
One woman's heroic journey
to find true love and defend her land

04:27.351 --> 04:29.769
amidst the ashes of a bitter conflagration.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.982
No, that's Gone with the Wind.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.734
This is just a spank book.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.569
lt is not a spank book.

04:39.154 --> 04:42.865
How about a little support?
l'm just trying to broaden my horizons.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.202
Okay, let's see how broad
your horizons get in chapter two.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.748
"Her breathing quickened as she
felt his turgid manhood

04:50.832 --> 04:53.751
"urge itself against her satin skirts.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.836
"These weren't the soft hands
of an aristocrat.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.965
"They were the calloused hands
of a man who knew the plow."

05:00.008 --> 05:01.509
And plow he does.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.595
Oh, give me that. You're making it dirty.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.763
lt is dirty.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.182
Okay, you're making it creepy.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.267
All l'm saying is why don't you
read something worthwhile?

05:10.352 --> 05:12.186
There are so many great books you
haven't read,

05:12.771 --> 05:14.021
like all of them.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.441
lt's just harmless fun,
like all those women you were with

05:17.526 --> 05:18.526
when we were married.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.697
Wow. "What are you reading?"
just took a nasty turn.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.118
Let's start over.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.456
ls this a historical novel
about the Civil War? Good for you, Jen.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.000
Thanks, Charlie.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.251
l won't tell you who wins.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.669
Oh, l know who wins.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.714
Every soldier
who comes in contact with Sabrina.

05:47.264 --> 05:50.016
l know it's just a stupid romance novel,

05:50.100 --> 05:51.267
but l can't let it go.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.645
Well, it's not unusual for a woman to be
stimulated by reading.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.647
Men and women are wired differently.

05:56.732 --> 06:01.610
Men are visual, and women are,
you know, smart.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.448
Hey, we're not only stimulated
by dirty pictures.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.074
We're not that crude.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.494
lf you're worried about me
seeing your thighs, don't be.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.080
Last night l used them as earmuffs.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.417
You know, l cannot wear this skirt
to a televised trial.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.962
You know, l mean, l am whoring myself out
as an expert witness,

06:20.047 --> 06:21.839
but l don't want to look like
one of those hookers

06:21.923 --> 06:23.340
this whackjob killed.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.469
Allegedly. Damn it. l have to remember
to say allegedly.

06:27.763 --> 06:30.556
You might want to think twice about
whackjob as well.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.392
What is going on with me?

06:33.477 --> 06:36.228
Maybe a romance novel
fondled me as a child.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.482
More likely you're hostile
towards these novels

06:39.566 --> 06:41.442
because they hold men
to an unrealistic standard

06:41.526 --> 06:42.943
you feel you can't compete with.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.946
You know what? l think you're right.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.285
Why are you taking off your pants?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.787
So we can have sex.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.622
We don't have sex during sessions.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.790
l thought we were done.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.627
You used Allport's concept of expressive
behavior to explain what l was doing,

06:59.711 --> 07:01.295
l had an epiphany, you got half-naked,

07:01.379 --> 07:02.880
l got another epiphany.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.634
Charlie, now that l'm your therapist
and not just your sex buddy,

07:06.718 --> 07:09.136
we need to keep our sessions
free of distractions.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.763
And for the record,

07:10.931 --> 07:12.807
it wasn't Allport, it was Harlow.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.892
Sure, it was Harlow.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.728
lf we're talking about monkeys
being raised by sock puppets.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.272
Otherwise, it was Allport.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.525
Why did they even let you graduate?
lt was Harlow.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.194
You ready to put your body
where your mouth is?

07:25.821 --> 07:30.991
l wouldn't need you if l could do that,
but, sure, you're on.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.660
Winner picks position.

07:32.911 --> 07:33.911
Done.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.664
You never learn.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.917
l guess Google
wants you to do a reverse cowgirl.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.087
Okay, fine. You win. l don't care.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.798
Just help me figure out something
to wear to the trial,

07:45.882 --> 07:47.341
and then, "Yee-haw."

07:48.051 --> 07:50.219
Sorry, gloating's over.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.721
There is a patient of mine
who's a personal shopper. Patrick.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.973
l'll text you his number.

07:54.349 --> 07:58.018
He can't make you smarter than me,
but he can make you look great.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.646
Oh, l guess the gloating wasn't over.

08:05.277 --> 08:08.195
So, we have to take as many
AP classes as we can

08:08.363 --> 08:10.948
because if we don't end up
in the top-fifth percentile,

08:11.158 --> 08:12.658
we fail in life.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.035
Who cares if l get into a good college?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.955
The only reason l'm going at all
is so l can partake in underage drinking

08:18.039 --> 08:20.708
and have lots of protected,
consensual sex. Lots.

08:22.586 --> 08:26.255
This immature attitude is exactly what
l want to rise above with this club.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.300
Sam, we know you're worried that you'll
never have sex

08:29.384 --> 08:31.552
because of your OCD stuff, but it's okay.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.095
We'll all share our stories with you.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.515
You're right. l will never have sex.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.853
Because l've already made love.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.981
With who? You've never even been to camp.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.858
No,

08:47.444 --> 08:50.029
but l've been to my Aunt Sabrina's
horse farm,

08:50.113 --> 08:52.740
and that's where l met a stable boy
named Beauregard.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.327
l called him...

08:58.830 --> 08:59.872
Beau.

09:02.083 --> 09:07.421
We were on vacation
and l decided to cool off in the lake.

09:08.924 --> 09:14.511
As l emerged, my moist skin glistened
like diamonds in the moonlight.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.596
He approached.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.764
Was he wearing a condom?

09:17.432 --> 09:20.893
Yes. He was standing in the middle of
the woods wearing nothing but a condom.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.102
You're an idiot.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.355
Then what?

09:24.439 --> 09:27.858
He pulled me to him and l felt

09:28.777 --> 09:30.319
the hard shape of his arousal.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.364
Then we rode back to the farm

09:33.448 --> 09:35.908
and he encouraged me
to take a lot ofAP classes

09:35.992 --> 09:38.077
so that we could meet up again
at a good college.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.664
That's so unfair.
l went to my uncle's horse farm,

09:41.748 --> 09:43.624
and all l did was shovel crap all summer.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.379
Hey, guys. Come on in.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.881
We can get started.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.093
l guess Patrick should be here any minute.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.762
What's Patrick even doing in this group?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.140
Passive-aggressiveness is not anger.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.310
ln my day we called it being on the rag.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.648
There are 1 2 major kinds of anger, Ed.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.567
And congratulations, with your display
of misogynistic homophobia,

10:10.652 --> 10:12.152
you've collected the whole set.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.908
Oh, come on, guys. We've talked about this.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.702
You're supposed to turn your phones off
before group.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.953
lt's a text from Patrick.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.913
l got one, too. He's quitting group.

10:22.998 --> 10:23.998
What?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.667
Mine's ringing,
but there's nobody on the other end.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.795
lt's a text, you old man.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.966
Holy crap. l've got 70 of these things.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.177
That Patrick is quitting, all right.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.265
Well, l can't say l'm not disappointed,

10:41.349 --> 10:44.768
but l'm not surprised that Patrick would text
everybody and leave me out.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.770
Classic passive-aggressive behavior.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.357
Oh, here we go.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.945
"Please tell Lacey, Nolan, and even
Ed that l will miss them.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.447
"Respectfully, Patrick."

10:57.699 --> 10:59.533
He didn't say respectfully, did he?

11:00.535 --> 11:02.369
Let me check. No.

11:05.957 --> 11:09.668
Okay, how many of you were able to keep
your kittens alive over the weekend?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.924
Okay, l guess we'll stop doing this one.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.969
We have a success story.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.597
We could use one of those.
Why don't you tell us what happened?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.932
Well, see, our anniversary is coming up.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.310
So l made a nice fresh batch of toilet wine

11:26.394 --> 11:28.312
and l got some Little Debbie snacks,

11:28.396 --> 11:29.730
and my brother smuggled in some coke

11:29.814 --> 11:31.565
to make the toilet wine seem good,

11:31.649 --> 11:34.902
and somebody stole
my Little Debbie snacks.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.906
Seeing my baby so upset
almost sent me into a blind rage.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.033
And the success story?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.827
Oh, yeah. Well, Cleo talked me down.

11:44.746 --> 11:49.500
l went through your steps and we ended up
having the best anniversary ever.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.295
See, it turns out that l had misplaced
my Little Debbies.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.714
They was in my ass the whole time.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.761
Always the last place you look.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.391
You know, l'm going through
something similar right now.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.852
l lost something, and l'm having
some emotions about it.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.145
What did you lose, boss?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.023
Actually, it was a patient from my
private group.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.442
We worked together for years
to get him to a better place,

12:15.527 --> 12:16.777
and he just up and left.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.737
l'm feeling a little disrespected.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.031
l got a story that might help you out.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.325
A couple years ago, this girl left me.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.411
l felt totally disrespected.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.621
Turns out my friend stole her from me.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.040
lt made me very angry,

12:30.667 --> 12:34.169
but l thought to myself, "He's a good friend.
He probably had a good reason."

12:34.879 --> 12:36.672
Long story short, l killed him.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.426
l killed them both.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.392
Thank you, Wayne. That is a terrifying story.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.811
Man, Charlie.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.648
ln a gang, if somebody leaves,
you track them down,

12:55.483 --> 12:57.234
but you don't ever go to the house

12:57.318 --> 12:59.319
because they're never going
to show up at the house.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.488
You just burn that down

13:02.657 --> 13:04.032
and go straight to their work.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.911
l can't go to his work.
lt's an invasion of privacy.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.663
lt could jeopardize our confidentiality.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.707
But the ho left you!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.045
You know what?

13:17.213 --> 13:19.923
l'm going to go to his work.
l deserve an explanation.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.884
Yeah, then you kill him.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.596
Then you kill anybody who saw you.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.063
Hello, Patrick.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.815
Charlie.

13:37.192 --> 13:40.527
Well, this isn't wildly inappropriate,
you showing up at my work.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.989
No one here knows who l am.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.365
l didn't come to embarrass you.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.950
Then why are you wearing that shirt?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.746
Now, goodbye, Charlie.
l only talk to customers.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.664
lf you think that's going to
get rid of me, it's not.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.749
l'll buy a shirt.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.877
How about this one?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.630
Yeah, l've got to stop
wearing these anyways.

13:59.714 --> 14:04.384
They don't breathe.
They stink. l think l'll just chuck it.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.179
l know why you're here, Charlie, and
just so you know,

14:07.263 --> 14:10.057
my new therapist says the best thing
to do is make a clean break.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.185
ls this about you feeling ignored
at the last meeting?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.729
Because that was a conscious effort
on my part not to...

14:16.689 --> 14:18.232
New therapist?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.442
ls it Kate?

14:20.735 --> 14:22.653
Look, l'm a challenging case.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.240
l just needed a different level
of expertise or any expertise at all.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.785
ls it Kate?

14:29.869 --> 14:33.330
Now this is really a better shirt for you.
Now you almost look professional.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.583
Come on. l know you're dying to tell me,

14:36.751 --> 14:39.628
but you won't because your pattern is to be
manipulative in a hurtful way

14:39.712 --> 14:41.338
that allows you not to be called out
on your anger.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.383
You know, Kate doesn't do as much
of the "blah-blah."

14:45.885 --> 14:48.595
l knew it! She stole you.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.265
You were just
supposed to dress her, that's it.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.474
And l did it brilliantly.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.935
The woman has boy hips and
monkey arms, and l made it work.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.814
You're making a mistake.
You need to continue with me.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.066
Need? You have no idea what l need.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.861
Look, l will also say that Kate is a
highly-trained professional,

15:04.946 --> 15:07.531
and certainly a most capable therapist.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.659
Now if you'll excuse me, l have to go.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.912
l'm having dinner
with the monkey-armed bitch.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.003
-Hey.
-Look, l got the good table.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.881
That's great.
Did you steal it from somebody else?

15:25.508 --> 15:29.428
After they spent years on it trying to
make it a better, more well-adjusted table?

15:30.555 --> 15:32.055
Okay, l know what you're thinking,

15:32.140 --> 15:33.432
but l would never do that to you.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.726
lt was 1 00 % Patrick's decision.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.979
l'm sorry, l wasn't listening.
That outfit is fabulous.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.981
lt makes your arms look almost human.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.192
Are you feeling angry?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.987
Don't therapize me right now.
We're talking as buddies.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.574
Oh, and, buddy, that was
a real dick move you pulled.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.492
Charlie, we're both professionals.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.203
Okay, people change therapists all the time.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.998
This is payback for me being right
about the Allport thing.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.043
And by the way, you're completely
undoing Patrick's therapy.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.337
So, ignoring him was therapy?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.422
Oh, so, yes, it was.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.300
He was seeking attention
in a passive-aggressive way,

16:08.384 --> 16:10.135
and l wasn't going to reward that.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.846
What you're doing is going
to make him completely backslide.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.349
Okay, l understand you are frustrated

16:15.433 --> 16:18.435
and l give you permission
to physicalize your anger appropriately

16:18.519 --> 16:20.187
within the environment.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.773
You give me permission.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.566
l don't need permission to do this.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.869
Thank you. lf you could attack me
with some salt next,

16:35.953 --> 16:37.496
that would be very helpful.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.793
You do understand this means war.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.213
l'm sorry, nothing compared
to what you guys do.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.423
Thanks for that, by the way.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.134
This means intense conflict.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.137
lt's not the same.

16:59.894 --> 17:00.894
Damn it.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.067
Charlie, l need to talk to you.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.694
We have a problem.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.697
Why can't you ever come in here and say,
"Charlie, we have a solution"?

17:13.116 --> 17:17.411
lt's Sam. She's talking about sex during
her college prep club meetings.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.579
Finally, some real college prep.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.498
l hope they cover how
to make a bong out of an apple

17:21.582 --> 17:23.250
and how to hump quietly in a bunk bed.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.503
Rule number one,
always take the bottom bunk.

17:27.505 --> 17:31.341
Charlie, your daughter is talking about
her own sexual encounters.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.718
But she hasn't had any.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.096
Well, according to the other parents,
she's talking about swimming naked,

17:36.180 --> 17:37.764
loins, and erections.

17:37.849 --> 17:38.974
Loins and erections?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.058
Sam!

17:41.436 --> 17:44.896
You know, if Sam's had sex,
it certainly didn't happen on my watch.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.691
You know, l did drop her off at that
skinny-dipping erection party last week.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.276
Was that bad?

17:51.279 --> 17:52.779
What's up?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.364
l'm in a prep club meeting.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.701
Sweetie, we've heard that you're telling
all your friends that you're having sex.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.035
What's going on, Sam?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.663
One of the girls said that l was never
going to have sex,

18:01.748 --> 18:03.874
so l made up a story, but don't worry,

18:03.958 --> 18:06.501
l'm going to wait
until l'm 25, just like Mom did.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.388
Let's get back to the stuff Sam made up.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.182
lt was just stuff l read.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.852
You see what happens when you
leave filth lying around the house?

18:24.187 --> 18:26.480
Hey, l don't have one single piece of
filth in this house.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.315
l got rid of all that when l bought my Nook.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.276
Mom, it was one of your books.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.069
Sabrina's Satin Surrender.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.579
Okay, now we know where it came from.
lt's not the end of the world.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.164
Sorry.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.834
Look, this isn't about blame. You felt
peer pressure to impress your friends.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.586
We all do that.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.047
l guess the only other thing
l have to say is...

18:54.050 --> 18:56.551
Sam, go back and send your friends
home for the night.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.386
We'll talk about this when they're gone.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.598
Thank God it's over.
Beauregard died like four chapters ago

19:01.682 --> 19:04.810
and all l've been doing is planting
cotton and raising the kids.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.190
Maybe l should get a Nook.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.819
So it is a turn-on.

19:13.903 --> 19:17.656
Yes. lt's the way women
wish they were treated.

19:18.366 --> 19:21.827
A woman loves it when the guy comes back
and fights for her,

19:21.911 --> 19:23.954
and sweeps her off her feet and takes her.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.456
Hey, whoa, whoa. So it's about
making someone feel wanted

19:26.541 --> 19:28.458
with a dramatic display of intense emotion.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.293
Yes, Mr. Spock.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.672
He's doing it because he has to have her.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.466
lt's about the passion, being overwhelmed.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.176
That's irresistible to women,

19:38.261 --> 19:40.887
but you'll never hear a girl say it
'cause it sounds kind of rapey.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.227
Patrick.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.479
Charlie, what are you doing here?

19:50.565 --> 19:53.400
Kate's all wrong for you.
l need you back and l need you back now.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.610
-l don't think...
-Don't think!

19:55.820 --> 19:57.696
There's nothing but this moment.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.282
You are coming back to group,
you will be in that chair tomorrow,

20:00.366 --> 20:03.076
and if you need extra attention,
you'll pay me and we'll do a private.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.744
Okay.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.164
l'll see you in session.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.125
You're not even going to carry me off?

20:10.585 --> 20:14.212
l have a tendon from my ass in my knee
and l don't want to test it.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.886
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.929
l just got a text from Patrick.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.432
l understand he's back
with you and l'm okay with that.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.809
Good. You coming in?

20:28.519 --> 20:32.063
lt's up to you. You know how much
l hate apologizing,

20:32.148 --> 20:33.231
and so here's the deal.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.442
You can either have me
or you can have an apology.

20:36.444 --> 20:39.112
Can l have a peek under that coat?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.489
Only if you don't pick apology.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.200
Let me say it's like
nothing you've ever seen.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.495
Are we talking topiary, piercing...

20:47.747 --> 20:48.872
Just pick sex.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.875
Not so fast. You're not going to sucker
me into this one.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.710
As a matter of fact,
since you offered the apology,

20:53.794 --> 20:55.420
l know you already feel
that you were wrong.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.340
So, l don't need an apology. l'll take you.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.635
Very nice. Pennington's theory of
anticipatory reasoning.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.804
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

21:05.806 --> 21:06.765
What?

21:06.849 --> 21:08.975
Well, you said Pennington,
but you know it's Wilmington.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.519
Okay, okay, fine.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.812
Pennington, l don't care.
