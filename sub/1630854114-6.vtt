00:02.536 --> 00:03.837
<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:03.937 --> 00:07.575
How would you feel about
sitting in that chair?

00:07.675 --> 00:09.143
That is your chair. No.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.879
That chair belongs to
the president of the company.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.381
I'm gonna be CEO.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.715
What is the difference?

00:14.815 --> 00:16.550
Well, the president does
all the work,

00:16.650 --> 00:18.186
and the CEO drops by
every now and then

00:18.286 --> 00:20.388
to criticize that work.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.591
So, you would be like my mother?

00:24.425 --> 00:25.793
Don't make it weird.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.162
Christina, what do you want?

00:28.262 --> 00:29.763
A chance at redemption,

00:29.863 --> 00:31.065
rebirth.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.268
Kofo, Goodwin, you guys
came to this country

00:34.368 --> 00:36.304
for a chance.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.607
It's the central promise
of this nation.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.677
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

00:43.777 --> 00:45.579
All right, pipe down,
Betsy Ross.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.581
What do you think?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.583
We do need a new janitor.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.420
I move we make Christina
the warehouse janitor.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.987
Ooh, I second it!

00:54.088 --> 00:55.723
All in favor. Aye.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.526
N-No, no, no, no aye. No aye.
Meeting adjourned.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.097
Morning.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.398
Good morning, my love.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.866
What are your plans
for today?

01:05.966 --> 01:07.135
As it happens,

01:07.235 --> 01:08.702
I'm taking myself to
the dollar theater

01:08.802 --> 01:12.106
to see a John Wayne
double feature.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.608
Mm. Have fun with The Duke.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.745
I didn't know
you knew John Wayne.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.614
In Nigeria, we know
all of your celebrities.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.650
You know, when I was young,
I used to think

01:22.750 --> 01:24.252
your president was Elvis.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.122
Malaysia.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.023
Hey, Wati, what's going on?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.594
Aw, man. I'm sorry.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.163
That time of year, huh?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.030
Oh, that reminds me,
I got to clean out the gutters.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.766
How bad is it?

01:43.304 --> 01:45.406
Well, why are you wasting time
talking to me? Call Goodwin.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.076
He's MaxDot president now.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.611
He handles this kind of thing.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.314
But he's going to yell at me.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.616
I used to yell at you
all the time.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.288
You ought to see me now.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.689
I never yell.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.491
In fact, these days
I can't stop smiling.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.893
That sounds irritating.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.533
I never made bad jokes.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.239
Well, maybe it's time
for you to take

02:18.339 --> 02:19.740
a little off your plate, too.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.079
Okay, nice
talking with you, Wati.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.615
Is there a problem at work?

02:27.715 --> 02:30.284
Yeah, we're a sock company
with no socks.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.685
What are you going to do?

02:31.785 --> 02:34.788
Well, I reckon
I'm going to see John Wayne.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.324
Ma'am.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.390
I have an extra Jell-O.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.593
The poor man in 203 died
before he could enjoy it.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.362
Oh, strawberry.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.930
I'm already over today.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.500
Had a five-catheter morning.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.735
Better to give them
than get them.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.572
Wouldn't it be great if we could
just go home right now?

03:24.672 --> 03:25.906
And do what?

03:26.006 --> 03:28.041
Go to the movies
in the middle of the day

03:28.141 --> 03:29.910
with all the other
useless people?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.380
Forgot who I was talking to.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.615
She's just frustrated
with her husband

03:34.715 --> 03:35.916
and taking it out on you.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.851
You are her work Bob.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.854
I mean, he had a chance
to go to work today,

03:40.954 --> 03:43.557
and he turned it down
without even a thought.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.525
Don't worry.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.859
You found a second husband.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.128
I am sure you'll be
able to find a third.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.997
I do not want another husband.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.799
I want this one.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.602
Well, this one is broken.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.837
Bob used to be
so dedicated to work.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.772
During one of
our first dates,

03:58.872 --> 04:02.676
he barely spoke to me because
he was so busy taking calls.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.913
That is when I knew
I would marry him.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.948
So why are you sitting here
whining?

04:08.048 --> 04:10.117
Do something about it.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.419
Like what?

04:11.519 --> 04:12.920
Either snap him
out of this nonsense

04:13.020 --> 04:15.088
or create a Tinder profile.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.658
Gloria, heads up.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.727
Ooh, death Jell-O.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.164
You're telling me
there's no socks

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
in the whole mid-Atlantic?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.001
Bubala, listen to me,

04:28.101 --> 04:32.340
I've been doing business with
your family for almost 50 years.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.808
I was at your freaking bris.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.777
I'm getting another call,
let me know when you pull

04:36.877 --> 04:38.211
your head out of your ass.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.647
Go for Dottie.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.015
Hey, Mom, how's it going
finding a new supplier?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.216
Terrible,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.118
but I'm having a blast.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.987
All this chaos

04:47.087 --> 04:48.656
reminds me of the old days.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.591
If only my heart
could still handle

04:50.691 --> 04:52.793
a pot of coffee
and an eight ball.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.530
It's amazing you only had
the one stroke.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.099
No leads?

04:59.199 --> 05:00.601
No, it's backed up everywhere.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.970
Not just Malaysia,
all the Asias.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.072
I'm glad you're having fun.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.440
You know me, sweetie.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.908
If I can't create the drama,

05:08.008 --> 05:09.677
at least I can enjoy it.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.679
Is that China?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.447
It's Bob.
May I?

05:13.547 --> 05:15.048
Goodwin wants to talk to you.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.149
Hey, Goodwin.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.250
Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.986
I have everything
under control.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.320
Enjoy your time at home.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.222
Okay. Well, call me
if you need me.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.191
Okay, I will not, bye-bye.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.894
Why didn't you
tell him the truth?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.028
That is the truth.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.329
No, it's not.
It will be!

05:32.466 --> 05:34.868
Drama, drama, drama.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.208
Oh, good, you are home.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.143
Close your eyes.
What?

05:43.243 --> 05:44.512
Close your eyes.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.814
I like where this is going.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.116
I got you a surprise.
Oh, boy.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.151
Okay, open.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.686
A suit?
You bought me a suit?

05:52.786 --> 05:53.787
I did.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.523
Aw, this'll be great
for church.

05:55.623 --> 05:59.159
All the aunties will be
feeding me their puff-puffs.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.429
It's not quite right for church,

06:01.529 --> 06:04.565
but it is perfect
for a chief executive officer.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.100
Very subtle,
Mrs. Wheeler.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.902
Is it? Let me try again.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.771
Go to work, please.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.005
Goodwin's running things.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.507
I don't want to step
on his toes.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.176
You are the boss.
His toes are meaningless.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.778
Try on your suit.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.749
I will, if you promise
to take it off.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.986
I am worried
you are misunderstanding me.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.922
Go. Back. To. Work.

06:33.293 --> 06:37.130
Okay, thank you for your time.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.566
No luck with Korea.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.067
Then why are you thanking them?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.069
Even if our world is ending,

06:42.169 --> 06:44.037
I still like to be polite.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.173
Talked to the factory
in Turkey that had surplus,

06:46.273 --> 06:49.409
but we got outbid by those
Fruit of the Loom douchebags.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.544
Freaking Fruit of the Loom.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.246
Freaking Fruit of the Loom!
Ugh!

06:53.346 --> 06:56.450
All my old contacts
are dead ends.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.886
Some of them are just dead.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.354
How many Red Bulls
have you had?

07:01.455 --> 07:04.858
I'll ease up, if you give me
some of your Adderall.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.895
This isn't how I thought
it would end.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.897
I figured it would be
Mom losing the company

07:09.997 --> 07:11.098
in a poker game.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.633
Me, too!

07:12.733 --> 07:15.068
I will tell the vendors
we are experiencing delays

07:15.168 --> 07:16.537
and their orders
are not en route.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.738
You will tell them nothing.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.707
But what do I say
when they call?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.008
That they <i>are</i> en route.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.009
But they are not en route.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.276
Stop saying that!

07:23.376 --> 07:25.312
Hi, this is Dottie Wheeler,

07:25.412 --> 07:28.215
may I speak
with Gene Eichelberger?

07:29.049 --> 07:33.053
Aw... he was a good guy.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.788
Guess who found us some socks.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.089
Oh!
Yay!

07:36.189 --> 07:37.558
Where did you find them?
I got friend of a friend

07:37.658 --> 07:39.126
who works
at the Port of Baltimore.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.494
He's got a container full

07:40.594 --> 07:42.162
of compression socks
just sitting there.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.031
Attaboy, Bobby!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.232
Yeah, I also watched <i>True Grit.</i>

07:45.332 --> 07:46.800
Pretty good day.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.401
This is wonderful news.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.504
I will not have to lie
to our customers.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.339
Slow down. You still might.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.441
Why are they sitting
in the port?

07:54.542 --> 07:57.044
Oh, a lot of times
when companies goes bankrupt,

07:57.144 --> 07:58.245
their merchandise sits in port.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.880
Under FIATA regulation,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.249
that product can't be moved
until they find a new buyer.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.984
Oh...
Good point.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.921
Yeah, this is recycling
and this is garbage.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.791
If we're gonna do this,
we got to go now.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.259
Otherwise, we're gonna
start missing shipments.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.393
Uh, Mr. Wheeler,

08:13.493 --> 08:14.895
I know you are trying to help,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.797
but we know nothing
about those socks.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.799
Then we better hit the road
and check 'em out.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.468
You got a better idea,
I'm all ears.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.707
Perhaps your better idea
is en route.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.411
Let's go.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.686
I am impressed that
you know how to drive this.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.187
Me, too.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.689
I'm kidding.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.090
Learned how to drive these
when I was a teenager,

08:43.190 --> 08:44.124
working for my dad.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.026
Those must be good memories.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.294
I hated it.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.096
All my friends were
chasing girls,

08:49.196 --> 08:50.664
smoking pot.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.601
I was trying to avoid
serial killers at truck stops.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.535
We have something in common.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.905
I, too, was exploited
by my father.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.006
Cheap labor.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.440
Free labor. Hmm.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.975
I resented it
at the time,

09:02.075 --> 09:04.978
but now I cannot wait
for my babies to grow up

09:05.078 --> 09:06.614
and work for nothing.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.886
I am sorry I put MaxDot
in such a terrible position.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.422
You're responsible
for global warming

09:15.522 --> 09:17.457
and an early monsoon season?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.926
I should have had a backup plan.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.929
Goodwin, you can't
put it all on yourself.

09:22.029 --> 09:22.930
Then who do I put it on?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.665
Well, off the top of my head,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.299
I'm gonna say Al Gore.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.735
What?
Think about it.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.569
He sounded
the whole global warming thing.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.539
Before that, we were just
enjoying really mild winters.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.608
You are talking nonsense.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.310
Yes, I am.
Helps me sleep at night.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.946
How about some music?

09:40.614 --> 09:41.715
Oh, yeah, here we go.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.450
Come on,
you know this one.

Hello.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.789
Hey, just calling
to say good night.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.924
Where are you?
Just outside Akron.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.226
Ah, I've never been there,
is it nice?

10:26.326 --> 10:27.895
No, it's Akron.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.964
How's your drive so far?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.867
Good. Tell your mother we loved
the dinner she packed for us.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.570
You miss me?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.773
You only left a few hours ago.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.008
Aw, sweetie,

10:41.108 --> 10:42.409
don't be sad,
I'll be home soon.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.477
She misses me.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.314
Oh, that's great.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.648
Everything at the hospital good?
Yeah.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.783
Kemi and Gloria behaving?
Hello, my love.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.051
Bob...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.453
could you finish your call
in the bathroom?

10:53.553 --> 10:55.122
I guess so.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.724
Hang on.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.991
Are the children ready for bed?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.126
Put them on.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.194
I was fine talking
in front of you.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.764
Hello, my babies.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.099
Are you ready
for your bedtime story?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.068
Mm-hmm.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.951
That's really sweet.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.519
This is private.
Go back in the bathroom.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.207
Any way we can turn that
down a little?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.910
No, I cannot.
What?

11:52.880 --> 11:56.049
If I turn it off,
I might suffocate in my sleep.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.519
I'm willing to
take that risk.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.522
I am sorry, but I have
unusually narrow airways

12:02.622 --> 12:03.857
for a man my size.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.793
Should've gotten two rooms.

12:05.893 --> 12:06.994
You agreed we should try

12:07.094 --> 12:08.495
to save the company money.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.932
That's before I knew
I was bunking with Darth Vader.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.433
Where are you going?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.803
To go get another room. Sure.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.070
That is the Wheeler way.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.438
What's that supposed to mean?

12:18.538 --> 12:19.807
Never mind.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.776
No, you got
your little mask off, spill it.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.411
Okay.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.713
Your free-spending,
devil-may-care attitude

12:26.814 --> 12:29.716
is what put MaxDot
on the brink of financial ruin.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.118
Is that right?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.720
Your company Cadillac,
your brother's Corvette,

12:33.821 --> 12:35.222
your brother.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.891
Somebody's been keeping a list.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.326
And checking it twice.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.794
Well, as long
as you're checking stuff,

12:40.894 --> 12:43.030
you might notice that
when I ran the joint,

12:43.130 --> 12:44.731
nobody had to
schlep to Baltimore

12:44.832 --> 12:46.733
to buy socks
out of a shipping container.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.901
So, you do blame me?

12:48.001 --> 12:50.003
No. Uh, a little.
I don't know!

12:50.103 --> 12:51.872
Good night, Mr. Wheeler.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.540
Aw, screw it.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.675
We only got
a couple hours left anyway.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.918
Goodwin.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.353
Hello?

13:09.222 --> 13:11.358
Fine, be that way.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.231
What is that disgusting odor?

13:18.331 --> 13:21.801
Oh, good, you can smell
through the mask.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.077
What's in that container?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.478
You a cop?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.213
Never mind.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.515
Right here.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.918
These socks are not stolen,
are they?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.153
You a cop?
Never mind.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.754
May I?

13:41.855 --> 13:43.656
Knock yourself out.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.293
Please be good,
please be good.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.328
Oh, here we go.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.797
These are beauties.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.832
Y-stitched heel.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.068
Check out that tight weave.

13:55.168 --> 13:59.306
Oh, people will love sliding
their feet into these babies.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.708
You guys really like socks, huh?

14:02.275 --> 14:03.843
Not in a weird way,
we sell 'em.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.279
We will need to inspect
the rest of the boxes.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.181
Fine with me.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.918
And you're clear this is
a cash transaction.
Yeah, we're clear.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.386
And you're legally authorized
to sell them.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.355
Never mind.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.524
Aw, these are great.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.792
If the whole shipment is
like this, we're saved.

14:19.893 --> 14:20.827
Thanks to you.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.362
Come on, man.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.897
I believe last night,

14:23.997 --> 14:26.466
just before
you intentionally farted...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.469
...you blamed me
for the company's misfortune.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.471
How about you and me
share the blame?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.041
I dumped MaxDot on you
and went on my merry way.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.308
You bought a boat.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.211
Mistakes were made
by all parties.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.247
I suppose
I was worried

14:40.347 --> 14:42.815
about saving face
than solving the problem.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.018
Nobody's perfect.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.453
I have to be.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.621
I am the first non-white,
non-Wheeler president,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.890
which means I get one chance.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.059
Says who?

14:52.159 --> 14:53.460
Says this country.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.462
Do I really have to give you
a history lesson?

14:55.562 --> 14:58.731
Okay, fine,
but this is not the country.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.201
This is MaxDot,

15:01.301 --> 15:04.004
where we pride ourselves
on screwing up

15:04.104 --> 15:06.173
over and over again.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.075
That's the Wheeler way.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.143
Thank you, my friend.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.912
All right, let me see if I can
get this guy to cut us a deal.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.147
Oh, let me do it.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.748
I am a Nigerian.

15:15.848 --> 15:16.849
So?

15:16.950 --> 15:18.986
Negotiating is in my blood.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.353
When I was born,

15:20.453 --> 15:22.355
my mother dragged herself
to three hospitals

15:22.455 --> 15:24.757
before she found
an acceptable price.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.326
Here you go.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.537
Can I tell you something?

15:37.637 --> 15:38.738
Sure.

15:38.838 --> 15:39.906
When you came
back to the company

15:40.007 --> 15:41.308
and they offered you
the janitor job,

15:41.408 --> 15:43.176
I thought for sure you'd say no.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.677
But you didn't.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.214
You took the job
and toughed it out.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.316
Showed a lot of character.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.185
Thank you, Douglas.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.820
I mean, if it was me,

15:53.920 --> 15:56.523
I would've hung myself
in the supply closet.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.892
Uh, pipes aren't sturdy
enough, I checked.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.831
Tell me something good.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.966
Oh, thank God!

16:07.067 --> 16:08.135
Bobby got the socks!

16:08.235 --> 16:09.469
Well, great job, honey.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.438
We'll see you when you get back.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.240
We should go celebrate.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.742
Great idea, Douglas.
Thank you, Mom.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.477
Oh, Christina, when you're
finished cleaning up here,

16:17.577 --> 16:19.812
maybe you can come and join us.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.789
Why aren't you eating?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.658
I have no appetite.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.693
Don't worry,
it's gonna be okay.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.861
Yes.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.596
Even if Bob's business
goes under

16:36.696 --> 16:39.599
and you lose your house,
you will still have me.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.434
You will live
with Gloria,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.270
but you will still have me.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.406
It's Bob.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.940
What happened?

16:48.041 --> 16:49.942
Oh, that's wonderful news.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.211
They got the socks.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.545
Oh, great.
Yes, yes, great.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.847
Are they still
at the Baltimore docks?

16:54.947 --> 16:56.549
Where are you? Yes.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.419
See if he can get me
a 60-inch flat-screen TV.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.954
Oh! And one of
those talking refrigerators.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.790
Okay, drive safe.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.126
I'll talk to you later tonight.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.494
I still have a house.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.129
To your house.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.564
To my house.
To your house.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.103
That is wonderful news.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.237
What is wonderful?

17:17.337 --> 17:19.239
Abishola says Bob got the socks.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.342
Finally he does something good.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.578
Congratulations,
you will not lose your home.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.049
I am so glad
I got Bob back to work.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.851
Uh-uh. You?

17:31.951 --> 17:34.721
I am the one who has been
shaming him day in and day out.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.723
That only made him feel weak.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.859
I gave him encouragement
when we were stranded

17:39.959 --> 17:41.594
on his stupid boat.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.430
When he asked me
if he should go back to work

17:43.530 --> 17:45.832
while we were playing
video games, I said yes.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.868
We can all agree
it was not Dele.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.703
Mm-hmm.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.973
You know, I put his name
on the prayer list

17:54.073 --> 17:55.308
at church every week.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.043
So, you are taking credit
for this?

17:57.144 --> 17:59.179
No, I am giving God credit.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.947
It was not God.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.882
It was me!

18:10.790 --> 18:12.792
This food is delicious.
You know why?

18:12.892 --> 18:15.928
These mom-and-pop places,
they make everything in-house.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.965
Nothing's premade,
nothing's frozen.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.467
Nothing's clean.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.203
I bet they never have to
scramble for supplies

18:23.303 --> 18:24.771
from Kuala Lumpur.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.840
I have never been there,
but I hate that place.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.877
You know...

18:31.844 --> 18:33.980
We could do it.
Do what?

18:34.080 --> 18:34.981
This.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.384
Make biscuits and gravy?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.686
Take back control
of our business.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.188
I do not understand.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.523
America used to have
a booming textiles industry,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.492
and we moved it all overseas.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.926
Why don't we

18:47.026 --> 18:48.161
bring it back?

18:48.261 --> 18:49.496
Oh, the cost would be astronomical.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.030
Only at first.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.400
But if we could control
our socks start to finish,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.635
our profit would skyrocket.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.639
We could be completely
vertically integrated.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.609
Everything
from spinning to knitting.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.244
The whole shebang.
Shebang?

19:04.344 --> 19:05.812
Magilla.
Oh, yes.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.447
Other companies
would call us

19:07.547 --> 19:09.916
when they had shipping problems.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.620
And we would gladly help them
out, charging ludicrous fees.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.388
We'd be bringing business

19:15.488 --> 19:16.423
back to Detroit.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.258
Ford. General Motors.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.327
MaxDot Therapeutic Hosiery.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.095
Mr. Wheeler, do not say all this
if you are not serious.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.399
I'm as serious as
a moisture-wicking toe seam.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.436
Last night I said
you were devil-may-care,

19:29.536 --> 19:30.503
but I was wrong.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.904
You are chutzpah!

19:32.004 --> 19:33.206
To chutzpah.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.774
To chutzpah.

19:43.916 --> 19:44.884
Hey.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.419
I thought you'd be asleep.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.289
I was staying awake
to give you a hero's welcome.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.225
Hero's a strong word.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.561
I mean, sure, I saved
the company from going under.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.296
Maybe hero's right.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.398
You must be exhausted.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.734
Actually, I'm kind of
excited about something.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.970
You've decided to go
back to running MaxDot?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.638
No, Goodwin's still in charge.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.608
Oh.
I'm gonna do something bigger.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.410
Oh!

20:11.177 --> 20:12.512
I'm gonna start up
a manufacturing division

20:12.612 --> 20:13.813
of MaxDot.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.316
So, you are not going to be
at home all day?

20:16.416 --> 20:17.850
No, it's gonna be a lot of work.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.118
I got to find a warehouse,

20:19.218 --> 20:20.853
buy knitting machines,
sock ovens,

20:20.953 --> 20:22.822
those little "Made in America"
stickers with the flags on 'em.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.360
All I heard is that
it's going to be a lot of work.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.228
It's also gonna be expensive.
Mm-hmm.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.331
We'll have to get a big loan.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.099
Have to put up
some kind of collateral.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.101
Collateral?
Yeah, probably the house.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.404
This house?

20:38.170 --> 20:39.572
Don't worry,
we're not gonna lose it.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.075
No one thinks they are going
to lose their house.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.011
That's right, positive thinking.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.879
Thanks for talking me into this.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.681
You're the best.
