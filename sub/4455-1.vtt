01:06.515 --> 01:08.233
Captain!

01:14.235 --> 01:16.191
- Eddie, my briefcase?
- Here.

01:16.395 --> 01:18.033
Hang on to it.

01:30.955 --> 01:34.027
All right, already. Come on, come on.

01:41.675 --> 01:44.030
This way, Mr. Brock.

01:58.035 --> 02:02.665
Mr. Brock, welcome to
the Washington Statler. Your wing...

02:02.875 --> 02:06.470
- I ain't got a whole floor?
- You've got an entire wing.

02:06.715 --> 02:10.229
I don't want one wing.
I want the whole bird.

02:10.435 --> 02:15.225
- Your private elevator.
- Private? That's more like it.

02:15.795 --> 02:17.387
- Hello.
- How are you?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.584
Mr. Brock...

02:18.795 --> 02:22.231
I thought you said this
was private. Take off.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.547
You should be satisfied.

02:26.955 --> 02:29.344
The public corridor and elevators...

02:29.555 --> 02:33.468
- West, East and South Suite.
- Which one's mine?

02:33.675 --> 02:36.826
The South Suite.
Each a private apartment.

02:38.155 --> 02:42.831
Sleeping quarters upstairs,
terrace overlooks Washington.

02:43.035 --> 02:45.754
- I'd like to point out...
- It's all right.

02:45.995 --> 02:49.067
I'd like to point out
that this suite...

02:54.955 --> 02:58.743
This suite is usually reserved
for foreign diplomats.

02:58.955 --> 03:02.630
Oh, I almost forgot.
We thought you'd like this.

03:02.835 --> 03:06.225
- Compliments of the management.
- Okay. Don't bother me.

03:09.755 --> 03:11.427
May I?

03:13.075 --> 03:16.624
May I show you the rest
of the accommodations?

03:25.955 --> 03:27.434
Hey, Billie!

03:30.155 --> 03:33.784
- What?
- Not bad, huh?

03:33.995 --> 03:38.307
- It's all right.
- You know what this place costs a day?

03:38.515 --> 03:41.234
Four hundred, you told me.

03:50.235 --> 03:53.864
- Mrs. Brock seems delighted.
- It's not " Mrs. Brock."

03:54.075 --> 03:56.953
Ain't no Mrs. Brock except my mother.
She's dead.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.184
I see.

03:58.395 --> 04:01.831
- Now look, don't get nosy.
- Oh, not at all.

04:02.275 --> 04:07.827
She's a fiancÃ©e. Mine, in fact.
Eddie, take care of him.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.068
Pardon me, sir.

04:11.035 --> 04:14.107
- Thank you, Mr. Brock.
- Okay. Don't bother me.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.228
How's the monarch of all he surveys?

04:17.435 --> 04:20.313
- You plastered again?
- Still. Welcome.

04:20.555 --> 04:22.432
I got things that can't wait.

04:22.635 --> 04:25.672
- I got this ticket to get fixed.
- What about?

04:25.875 --> 04:28.673
Some louse, just as we blew into town.

04:28.915 --> 04:32.703
- I'm a lawyer, I don't own the law.
- What'd I do?

04:32.955 --> 04:35.071
I'll see what I can manage.

04:35.515 --> 04:37.904
- How'd we do?
- May cost a shade more.

04:38.155 --> 04:39.713
- How much?
- It's negligible.

04:39.915 --> 04:42.065
- Why more?
- Supply and demand, Harry.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.273
Crooks are rare in these parts.
Don't worry.

04:45.475 --> 04:48.114
Don't worry?
This stuff ain't deductible.

04:48.315 --> 04:52.308
I'm not so sure.
"Item: One bribe, $80,000."

04:52.515 --> 04:55.188
Eighty! You're very handy
with my dough!

04:55.715 --> 05:00.664
Fellow's coming up here any minute
to interview you. Paul Verrall.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.070
Freelance snoop. Political stuff.

05:03.275 --> 05:06.506
I don't wanna talk to no writer.
Eddie!

05:06.715 --> 05:09.024
- You better talk to this one.
- Why?

05:09.235 --> 05:14.434
He's one to look out for.
Take him in, then he won't go poking.

05:14.635 --> 05:17.433
What's so important?

05:17.915 --> 05:20.065
What we're after is important.

05:20.315 --> 05:24.069
Listen, to get by in this town
takes power. You got some.

05:24.275 --> 05:26.106
Takes money. You got plenty.

05:26.315 --> 05:29.864
But above all, it takes
judgement and intelligence.

05:30.075 --> 05:33.272
That's why you pay me
100,000 a year.

05:33.875 --> 05:38.665
- What's all the excitement?
- Just making it clear where I fit in.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.673
- Eddie, get me a shave up here.
- Right.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.069
- Harry.
- What?

05:43.315 --> 05:44.304
Barber shop!

05:44.515 --> 05:47.985
Tell Billie to wear something plain
for the congressman.

05:48.235 --> 05:50.874
Tell her yourself. You ain't pregnant.

05:51.115 --> 05:53.675
Send up a barber
and a manicure right now.

05:53.875 --> 05:57.185
Harry Brock! That's right.
Okay, make it snappy.

05:57.395 --> 05:59.909
- And a shine!
- And a shine! Be right up.

06:00.155 --> 06:05.183
Look, don't you worry about Billie.
One thing, she knows how to dress.

06:05.635 --> 06:06.954
Probably Verrall.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.587
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Jim.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.314
Harry Brock, Paul Verrall.

06:12.555 --> 06:14.227
- How do you do?
- How are you?

06:14.435 --> 06:17.791
- Ain't I seen you before?
- I'll leave you.

06:17.995 --> 06:19.587
What'll you drink?

06:19.795 --> 06:22.355
- Scotch, if you got it.
- If I got it? Eddie.

06:22.555 --> 06:24.307
Where do you think you are?

06:24.555 --> 06:27.115
Where you been?
Get him a Scotch and...

06:27.355 --> 06:28.504
- Soda?
- Water.

06:28.755 --> 06:32.714
- Rye ginger ale for you?
- Right. He knows.

06:32.915 --> 06:36.954
Worked for me many years.
He's my cousin. He knows me.

06:37.155 --> 06:39.623
- Right.
- Maybe I'll interview Eddie.

06:39.835 --> 06:43.714
Pretty good. Maybe you
got something there. Sit down.

06:43.915 --> 06:47.430
What's it gonna be, pal?
A plug or a pan?

06:47.635 --> 06:50.103
I know how to talk
if I know your angle.

06:50.355 --> 06:52.789
- No angle, just facts.
- A pan?

06:52.995 --> 06:55.509
- Not exactly.
- Write whatever you want.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.393
Come up. I wanna get shaved.

06:57.675 --> 07:02.226
Nobody can hurt me.
I'm only talking because Jim asked me.

07:02.435 --> 07:06.269
Pay him 100 grand for advice,
I'm a sucker not to take it.

07:06.515 --> 07:09.632
- That's right.
- Butt out, will you?

07:10.475 --> 07:13.114
Devery likes it
when I get wrote about.

07:13.355 --> 07:16.984
- What do you wanna know?
- How much money you got?

07:17.195 --> 07:18.184
What?

07:18.395 --> 07:21.228
- How much money?
- What am I, an accountant?

07:21.475 --> 07:23.306
- You don't know?
- Not exactly.

07:23.555 --> 07:25.625
- Fifty million?
- I don't know.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.228
- Ten million?
- Maybe.

07:27.475 --> 07:28.874
- One million?
- More.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.787
- How much more?
- Plenty.

07:32.395 --> 07:35.831
- I made every nickel of it.
- Nice work.

07:36.035 --> 07:39.664
You're gonna give me the business.
That's all right.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.833
- You got me all...
- Tell how I'm a roughneck.

07:43.075 --> 07:45.430
Everybody's scared.
For me, that's good.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.074
Well, not everybody.

07:47.235 --> 07:51.274
Enough. You can't hurt me.
All you can do is build me up.

07:51.515 --> 07:54.871
- Hey, Eddie. Have a drink.
- No, thanks, really.

07:55.235 --> 07:58.432
Do what I tell you.
Who pays you around here?

07:59.755 --> 08:03.828
At home, he shaves me.
I got my own barber chair, right?

08:04.035 --> 08:05.434
That's right.

08:06.355 --> 08:09.870
- Go ahead, pal. Interview me.
- Where were you born?

08:10.075 --> 08:15.103
Plainfield, New Jersey. 1907. I went
to work when I was 12 years old.

08:15.315 --> 08:19.831
I been working ever since.
My first job was a paper route.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.464
I bought a kid out with a swift kick.

08:22.675 --> 08:24.905
And you've been
working ever since.

08:25.115 --> 08:29.825
Tell you how I'm top man in my racket.
Been in it 25 years.

08:30.035 --> 08:33.265
- Steel.
- Not steel, junk.

08:33.515 --> 08:37.554
- And I ain't ashamed to admit it.
- All right.

08:37.755 --> 08:40.587
Here's some advice:
Never bull a bull artist.

08:40.794 --> 08:43.866
I can sling it with the best of them.

08:44.115 --> 08:48.313
- For 25 years, you say?
- Yeah. I'm a kid with a paper route.

08:48.515 --> 08:52.110
I got a wagon. Going home,
I pick up junk in alleys.

08:52.315 --> 08:55.432
I'm not the only one.
Other kids do it too.

08:55.635 --> 08:58.911
Difference is, they keep it.
Not me. I sell it.

08:59.155 --> 09:03.114
I'm making eight dollars in junk
and three from papers.

09:03.355 --> 09:07.314
I see which is the right racket.
I'm a kid, but I see that.

09:07.555 --> 09:10.786
Soon the guy I sell to
is handing me 20 a week.

09:11.235 --> 09:15.069
Then he turns around,
offers me a job for 10. Dumb jerk.

09:15.315 --> 09:18.273
I'd sell him his own stuff
and he never knew.

09:18.515 --> 09:20.506
- How do you mean?
- Look...

09:20.715 --> 09:24.151
In the night,
I drag it out, I load it up.

09:24.355 --> 09:27.427
In the morning I go in
the front and collect.

09:27.675 --> 09:30.473
- Twelve years old?
- Something like that.

09:30.835 --> 09:33.349
- Pretty soon you own the yard.
- Right.

09:33.555 --> 09:36.911
The jerk works for me now.
Know who else does?

09:37.115 --> 09:42.235
The kid whose paper route I swiped.
I figure I owe him.

09:43.355 --> 09:46.233
Good last few years
for the junk business.

09:46.435 --> 09:50.826
- I ain't kicking.
- Do you anticipate any decline now?

09:51.155 --> 09:54.147
- Talk plain.
- Is it still going to be good?

09:54.355 --> 09:55.868
- We'll make it good.
- Who?

09:56.075 --> 09:57.588
- Me, that's who.
- I see.

09:57.795 --> 10:00.150
- Fancy talk don't go with me.
- Come in.

10:00.715 --> 10:03.024
- Good evening.
- Hello.

10:03.715 --> 10:06.309
- I'll get out...
- No, don't go. I like you.

10:06.555 --> 10:10.104
Play your cards right,
I'll put you on the payroll.

10:10.355 --> 10:15.224
Once over light, no talk.
I get a manicure every day.

10:16.235 --> 10:18.624
Over there someplace.

10:20.355 --> 10:22.425
Okay, fellow, go ahead.

10:22.635 --> 10:25.672
I wonder what you're doing
in Washington.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.912
What are you, a wonder boy?
Not so tight.

10:29.155 --> 10:31.908
Sightseeing, that's what I'm doing.

10:32.115 --> 10:34.709
Some talk you've come
to find out...

10:34.915 --> 10:37.713
So far I've been nice to you.
Don't pump me.

10:37.955 --> 10:42.267
How's it going? How are you getting
on with King Junk?

10:42.475 --> 10:46.229
He was born in New Jersey.
Sure is a tough man to dig.

10:46.435 --> 10:49.552
I can't believe that.
He loves to talk. Billie!

10:49.755 --> 10:51.950
This is Paul Verrall.
Billie Dawn.

10:52.195 --> 10:53.184
How do you do?

10:55.315 --> 10:57.351
- Wait.
- What's the matter?

10:57.755 --> 11:00.588
Where you going? Put it back!

11:00.955 --> 11:03.025
- I just wanted...
- Put it back!

11:03.235 --> 11:04.714
- Why...?
- Because I say.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.708
Somebody's coming.
I don't want you stinking.

11:07.955 --> 11:12.631
- Can't I just...?
- Go change. Don't give me no trouble!

11:13.435 --> 11:15.232
Do what I'm telling you!

11:26.915 --> 11:30.430
Barber, what'll you take
to cut his throat?

11:31.555 --> 11:33.034
Some jokes I don't like.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.625
- Don't get excited.
- Don't tell me what to do!

11:37.755 --> 11:41.714
- Just a joke, Harry.
- That's all. I said beat it.

11:41.955 --> 11:43.308
Eddie, take care of them.

11:43.555 --> 11:45.705
- I'll be going too.
- No, don't.

11:45.915 --> 11:47.906
You're the only friend
I got left.

11:48.155 --> 11:52.148
I live around the corner.
If anybody beats you, scream.

11:52.355 --> 11:53.708
I'll come running.

11:53.955 --> 11:56.469
- Goodbye, Jim. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

11:58.315 --> 12:00.510
I need Billie's signature.

12:00.715 --> 12:03.832
Sure. Billie!

12:05.115 --> 12:08.664
- You sore?
- Not sore, Harry.

12:09.475 --> 12:12.273
- You look funny.
- I know.

12:13.115 --> 12:17.188
- You want an aspirin?
- No, no, I'm fine.

12:17.675 --> 12:20.667
Considering I've been dead
for 16 years...

12:20.875 --> 12:23.628
...l'm in remarkable health.

12:30.155 --> 12:32.874
- Billie!
- What?

12:33.075 --> 12:34.827
Billie!

12:37.115 --> 12:40.073
- What?
- Come over here right away!

12:40.435 --> 12:43.268
Honey, would you please
fix the safety catch?

12:43.475 --> 12:46.512
- He sure got good lungs.
- Yeah. Thanks.

12:46.755 --> 12:50.270
There's a shortcut through
the service. This way.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.072
- That's the door, honey.
- Thanks, honey.

13:06.155 --> 13:08.430
Sometime I don't understand you.

13:08.635 --> 13:11.229
- Sometime?
- What do you want?

13:11.435 --> 13:12.424
Jim.

13:12.635 --> 13:15.308
Few things I want you to sign, honey.

13:15.515 --> 13:19.827
- That's all I do around here.
- Too bad about you.

13:20.035 --> 13:22.708
- When's this congressman coming?
- Anytime.

13:22.955 --> 13:24.911
I better get fixed up, huh?

13:25.155 --> 13:27.669
- She look all right?
- Look who's talking.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.834
You tell me. I don't wanna start off
on no left foot.

13:34.635 --> 13:36.307
What got into him?

13:36.515 --> 13:39.313
Nothing. Wants to make
a good impression.

13:39.555 --> 13:41.068
So let him.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.912
Two places on this one, please.

13:46.115 --> 13:49.107
What happened to all that stuff
I signed last week?

13:49.355 --> 13:50.868
All used up.

13:51.675 --> 13:54.428
I must've signed
about a million of these.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.865
What you get as corporate officer.

13:57.075 --> 14:00.067
I am? What do you know?

14:00.955 --> 14:03.230
Come a long way from the chorus.

14:03.435 --> 14:06.507
I wasn't only in the chorus.
I spoke lines.

14:06.755 --> 14:09.064
- Really?
- Of course.

14:10.075 --> 14:12.714
- How many?
- How many what?

14:12.915 --> 14:15.349
- Lines did you speak?
- Five.

14:16.115 --> 14:18.504
- I never knew that.
- Ask anybody.

14:18.715 --> 14:20.273
I believe you.

14:21.315 --> 14:24.910
I could've been a star
if I'd have stuck to it.

14:25.115 --> 14:29.108
- Why didn't you?
- Harry didn't want me in the show.

14:29.355 --> 14:33.064
He didn't wanna share me
with the general public.

14:33.275 --> 14:34.628
I see.

14:37.355 --> 14:40.267
Harry's changed. Don't you think so?

14:40.555 --> 14:44.025
- How?
- He used to be more satisfied.

14:44.235 --> 14:46.510
Now he's always
running around like this.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.315
What'd he have to come
to Washington for?

14:49.555 --> 14:53.309
- Long story.
- Well, don't tell it to me.

14:53.555 --> 14:58.106
- I just wish he'd settle down.
- He's ambitious.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.432
He talks all the time now.
He never used to.

15:01.635 --> 15:06.504
Now he always tells me how
he's gonna be bigger, run everything.

15:06.755 --> 15:12.034
- He may, at that.
- I don't care one way or the other.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.548
- Take it easy.
- Now don't you start!

15:16.755 --> 15:19.144
Better to drink after they're gone.

15:19.355 --> 15:21.630
- This congressman?
- And Mrs. Hedges.

15:21.835 --> 15:24.668
- This fella works for him.
- In a way.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.264
So what's he putting it on for?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.311
Just be nice. No rough language.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.706
- I won't open my mush.
- I didn't mean that.

15:33.955 --> 15:38.233
I don't have to be down here.
I could go back to my place.

15:38.435 --> 15:40.824
In fact, I think I will.

15:41.035 --> 15:45.426
- I tell you, Harry wouldn't like it.
- All right, all right!

15:52.955 --> 15:56.425
How are you, Norval?
Haven't seen you in ages, Anna.

15:56.675 --> 15:58.108
- You haven't.
- Come in.

15:58.355 --> 16:02.906
You remember this little lady.
She used to be Billie Dawn.

16:03.155 --> 16:05.111
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.915
This is Mr. Hedges
I've told you about.

16:08.115 --> 16:09.707
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

16:09.955 --> 16:13.311
- And this is Mrs. Hedges.
- Glad to meet you.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.426
Glad to meet you.

16:20.955 --> 16:24.027
- How about the terrace?
- That'd be nice.

16:24.235 --> 16:25.304
- A drink?
- Love one.

16:25.555 --> 16:27.307
- Sounds all right.
- Scotch?

16:27.555 --> 16:29.864
- Scotch all around, Eddie.
- Right.

16:35.675 --> 16:36.710
He's awfully tired.

16:36.955 --> 16:41.631
- Stand over a hot resolution all day?
- Just about.

16:52.555 --> 16:55.467
How do you like Washington,
Mrs. Brock?

17:02.555 --> 17:07.265
- I haven't seen it yet.
- This is the first time you've been?

17:07.474 --> 17:11.069
That's what I mean.
I never went on the road.

17:11.275 --> 17:15.108
Well, we must show you around.
Beautiful city.

17:15.355 --> 17:18.904
Too bad the Supreme Court
isn't in session.

17:19.155 --> 17:20.667
What is it?

17:25.635 --> 17:28.069
Lots of people'd
like to know that.

17:28.275 --> 17:30.630
- Hello.
- Mr. Hedges, Harry Brock.

17:30.835 --> 17:32.791
It's about time we got together.

17:32.995 --> 17:35.668
Mrs. Hedges, I'm happy to meet you.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.673
- Thank you.
- Sit down. Congressman.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.915
- Have a good trip?
- I come in my car.

17:48.155 --> 17:52.307
Stopped in Baltimore.
I got a junkyard there, second one.

17:52.555 --> 17:55.672
- Before, I only had one.
- How many do you have?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.945
I couldn't answer that, baby.

17:59.675 --> 18:01.711
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

18:01.955 --> 18:06.073
I don't know why I like Baltimore.
I get a feeling from it.

18:06.275 --> 18:08.914
- Sentimental.
- Yes, I'm sentimental.

18:09.115 --> 18:12.630
I think we're all a bit sentimental.

18:13.155 --> 18:16.625
Well, it's a free country.

18:21.915 --> 18:26.067
- Do you play bridge, Mrs. Brock?
- No, only gin.

18:26.555 --> 18:28.432
- I beg your pardon?
- Gin rummy.

18:28.635 --> 18:30.466
Oh, yes, of course.

18:30.715 --> 18:34.913
I was going to ask you to join us.
A few of the girls meet.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.549
I don't play bridge.

18:37.795 --> 18:40.673
- You could learn!
- I don't think so.

18:41.075 --> 18:45.227
She couldn't play till I learned her.
Now she beats my brains out.

18:46.955 --> 18:49.867
How're you fixed for time tomorrow?

18:50.075 --> 18:52.464
- Ten o'clock?
- Pretty early for me.

18:52.675 --> 18:54.631
I'll say.

18:56.355 --> 18:58.346
- Eleven?
- Okay.

18:58.755 --> 19:02.225
- I can drop by here.
- Sure, it's on your way.

19:02.435 --> 19:06.428
We can discuss the operation
and get a head start.

19:09.755 --> 19:13.225
Wanna wash your hands
or anything, honey?

19:14.195 --> 19:15.913
<i>No, thank you.</i>

19:18.515 --> 19:21.348
I hope you're free
for Friday night dinner.

19:21.555 --> 19:24.865
- People I want Harry to meet.
- Who wanna meet him.

19:25.075 --> 19:29.114
- Thank you for everything, Mr. Brock.
- Call me Harry.

19:29.355 --> 19:32.506
I haven't written you...
You understand.

19:32.715 --> 19:35.309
You know I'm interested
in scrap iron.

19:35.555 --> 19:39.309
I wanna sell it and not get stuck
with falling prices.

19:39.555 --> 19:43.514
- I have a copy...
- Boil it down and give it to me.

19:43.715 --> 19:48.027
I didn't come here to do paperwork.
The way I work is this:

19:48.235 --> 19:50.988
Get the other guy
before he gets you.

19:52.555 --> 19:57.310
I got in mind a worldwide
operating combo. Enough for everybody.

19:57.515 --> 20:01.827
Up till now, everybody's lined up
and understands everybody.

20:02.035 --> 20:05.630
- I wanna move.
- You understand that legislation...

20:05.835 --> 20:10.909
That's a lot of hot air.
I ain't talking about peanuts...

20:12.115 --> 20:15.073
Give them enough rope. I've said so.

20:19.835 --> 20:22.349
The trouble with these do-gooders is...

20:22.555 --> 20:26.628
They never seem to know when to stop.
I've said...

20:28.115 --> 20:31.664
We can do this.
It's up to you to find out how.

20:31.915 --> 20:34.304
One amendment, for example...

20:34.555 --> 20:38.707
...guarantees government support
of scrap iron price levels.

20:38.955 --> 20:40.673
We want to get it through.

20:40.875 --> 20:44.993
See that you do. I'm here
to see that I get what I paid for.

20:45.235 --> 20:48.307
- How do things look to you?
- Generally?

20:48.515 --> 20:53.908
This country has to decide if
the people will run the government...

20:54.115 --> 20:56.345
...or the other way around.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.113
That's sound thinking.

20:58.355 --> 21:00.073
- Thank you.
- Worthy of Holmes.

21:00.275 --> 21:01.913
Great man, Holmes.

21:02.155 --> 21:05.306
- My personal god.
- Who?

21:05.755 --> 21:09.430
- Oliver Wendell Holmes.
- A wonderful man.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.905
He gonna be here Friday night?

21:12.155 --> 21:14.715
- I don't think so.
- Too bad.

21:14.915 --> 21:17.349
- We mustn't keep you.
- We mustn't.

21:17.555 --> 21:19.511
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:19.755 --> 21:22.872
- Good night. See you tomorrow.
- That's right.

21:23.075 --> 21:26.067
- Good night, Anna.
- Thank you so much.

21:26.275 --> 21:30.063
Wait a while. I'll give you
something to thank me for.

21:31.075 --> 21:32.508
Good night, all.

21:50.515 --> 21:51.948
Drips.

21:52.155 --> 21:54.305
- They're drips.
- Who are you to say?

21:54.515 --> 21:57.507
- I'm myself.
- Nobody asked you. Shut up.

21:57.755 --> 22:01.350
- Pardon me for living.
- Get lost.

22:01.595 --> 22:04.268
- Not yet.
- Get lost, I told you.

22:17.155 --> 22:20.113
- She'll be in the way.
- What are you gonna do?

22:20.355 --> 22:23.313
- I'd like to give her the brush.
- Complicated.

22:23.515 --> 22:26.666
- I know.
- She owns more of you than you do.

22:26.875 --> 22:31.426
She's gonna louse me up down the line.
Dumb broad.

22:31.835 --> 22:33.109
You may be right.

22:33.355 --> 22:36.074
- Listen, Harry. Send her home.
- No.

22:36.275 --> 22:37.754
Why not?

22:40.435 --> 22:43.711
- I'm nuts for her.
- Can't have your cake and eat it.

22:43.915 --> 22:45.143
Just a saying.

22:45.355 --> 22:48.631
- That don't make any sense.
- All right.

22:52.075 --> 22:56.034
- What's cake got to do with it?
- Nothing, Harry.

22:56.235 --> 22:59.113
- Must be a way to smarten her up.
- I guess so.

22:59.355 --> 23:01.915
- Some kind of school?
- I doubt that.

23:02.075 --> 23:03.269
Then what?

23:03.435 --> 23:06.905
We might find someone
to smooth the rough edges.

23:07.115 --> 23:09.675
- How?
- Let me think about it.

23:10.715 --> 23:14.503
I want you to think about something.
About marrying her.

23:14.715 --> 23:17.070
Why marriage all of a sudden?

23:17.275 --> 23:20.665
A wife couldn't testify
against her husband.

23:20.875 --> 23:24.231
You've been engaged for seven years.
Why wait?

23:24.435 --> 23:26.153
I didn't wanna be rushed.

23:26.355 --> 23:29.745
We get married,
she'll think she's got it coming.

23:29.955 --> 23:32.025
- She's different.
- A broad's a broad.

23:32.235 --> 23:34.624
- You'll be sorry.
- I'll let you know.

23:34.875 --> 23:37.469
We still gotta do something about her.

23:37.675 --> 23:42.066
She opens her kisser,
something wrong come out. Talk to her.

23:42.275 --> 23:44.425
- Take more than a talk.
- Then what?

23:44.635 --> 23:47.627
It's not easy to make a person over.

23:47.835 --> 23:51.714
Wait. That interview guy.
He's a smart cookie.

23:51.915 --> 23:53.109
Paul Verrall.

23:53.315 --> 23:55.704
He knows this town. He's classy.

23:55.955 --> 23:57.707
- But he won't do it.
- Why?

23:57.955 --> 24:01.072
- I'll pay him what he wants.
- I don't think so.

24:01.275 --> 24:03.391
I bet you. What's his number?

24:03.635 --> 24:07.469
- I'm not sure...
- What's his number? Come on.

24:09.155 --> 24:11.350
- You ate already?
- Yeah.

24:11.755 --> 24:13.313
- Piece of pie?
- No.

24:13.555 --> 24:16.069
- Sit. How about a drink?
- No, thanks.

24:22.555 --> 24:24.113
Okay, pal.

24:24.355 --> 24:27.267
- I wanna ask you something.
- Sure.

24:27.475 --> 24:30.273
- How much you make?
- Am I an accountant?

24:30.475 --> 24:33.512
- I love this guy. Your name again?
- Verrall.

24:33.755 --> 24:35.507
- Your regular name.
- Paul.

24:35.715 --> 24:40.709
I got a friend, a good kid...
Maybe you seen her around. Billie?

24:40.955 --> 24:43.469
She's a little on the stupid side.

24:43.675 --> 24:45.905
I got her out of the chorus.

24:46.115 --> 24:50.825
She'll be unhappy here,
never been with such kind of people.

24:51.035 --> 24:52.753
- Know what I mean?
- I don't.

24:52.995 --> 24:56.271
- You could help her out. Me too.
- How?

24:56.475 --> 25:01.105
Explain things to her in your
spare time. What do you say?

25:01.355 --> 25:05.746
- I don't think I could handle it.
- Mean an awful lot to me.

25:06.675 --> 25:09.348
I'll give you 200 bucks a week.

25:12.115 --> 25:14.675
- I'll do it.
- I love this guy.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.513
- When do I start?
- Now.

25:16.715 --> 25:21.743
Come with me and I'll introduce you.
You can take it from there.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.463
Billie!

25:28.835 --> 25:32.350
- What?!
- Come down here a minute. Come on in.

25:32.595 --> 25:35.155
She's a nice kid.
You're gonna like her.

25:36.555 --> 25:40.753
- I'm getting dressed.
- He's a friend of the family.

25:40.955 --> 25:43.344
Come on, I'm telling you!

25:47.115 --> 25:48.992
- This is Paul Verrall.
- I know.

25:49.235 --> 25:50.793
He wants to talk to you.

25:50.995 --> 25:52.951
- What about?
- You'll find out.

25:53.155 --> 25:57.353
Jim and I got work to do.
I'll have to leave you two.

26:09.715 --> 26:12.752
Your friend, Mr. Brock, has an idea.

26:12.995 --> 26:15.987
He'd like us to spend
a little time together.

26:16.235 --> 26:17.793
You and me, that is.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.991
- You don't say.
- Yes.

26:20.195 --> 26:23.392
- What are you, a gigolo?
- Not exactly.

26:23.595 --> 26:26.985
- So what's the idea?
- Well, it's nothing special.

26:27.195 --> 26:31.711
He'd like me to put you wise
to a few things, show you the ropes.

26:31.915 --> 26:34.349
- Answer any questions.
- I got none.

26:34.555 --> 26:37.547
- I'll give you some.
- Thanks.

26:38.675 --> 26:41.985
It might be fun for you.
There's a lot to see here.

26:42.195 --> 26:44.186
I'd be glad to show you around.

26:44.435 --> 26:46.585
- You know the Supreme Court?
- Yes.

26:46.795 --> 26:49.389
- I'd like to take that in.
- Fine.

26:49.635 --> 26:51.785
- We're on, then?
- How you mean?

26:51.955 --> 26:53.149
The arrangement.

26:53.315 --> 26:56.990
- I don't mind. Got nothing to do.
- Good.

26:57.235 --> 26:59.988
- What's he paying you?
- Two hundred.

27:00.235 --> 27:02.954
You could've got more.
He's got plenty.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.305
Oh, I'd have done it for free.

27:05.515 --> 27:06.914
- I would.
- Why?

27:07.115 --> 27:09.948
This isn't work. I like it.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.709
- He thinks I'm too stupid, huh?
- No.

27:12.915 --> 27:15.383
He's right. I'm stupid and I like it.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.354
- You do?
- Sure.

27:17.555 --> 27:21.753
I got everything I want.
Two mink coats, everything.

27:21.955 --> 27:24.788
If there's something I want, I ask.

27:24.995 --> 27:27.555
And if he don't act friendly...

27:29.315 --> 27:31.545
...I don't act friendly.

27:32.635 --> 27:36.514
As long as I know how to get
what I want, that's all.

27:36.715 --> 27:39.707
- As long as you know what you want.
- Sure.

27:39.915 --> 27:43.510
- What?
- As long as you know what you want.

27:43.755 --> 27:47.464
- Are you trying to mix me up?
- Well, no.

27:51.995 --> 27:54.907
- I'll tell you what I would like.
- Yes?

27:55.115 --> 27:58.425
- I'd like to learn how to talk good.
- All right.

27:58.755 --> 28:01.110
- Is it hard?
- I don't think so.

28:01.315 --> 28:03.112
What do I have to do?

28:03.315 --> 28:06.546
I might give you
a few books to start with.

28:06.755 --> 28:10.191
Every now and then I'll correct you.

28:10.435 --> 28:12.995
- Go ahead.
- Well, that is, when I know.

28:13.195 --> 28:15.789
- I don't talk so good myself.
- You'll do.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.873
- Good.
- I never say "ain't." Did you notice?

28:19.075 --> 28:21.669
- Oh, I do.
- I'll correct you then.

28:22.235 --> 28:25.352
- Do that.
- Since I was small I never say it.

28:25.595 --> 28:28.109
Our teacher used to slug you
if you did.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.112
- Did what?
- Said "ain't."

28:30.315 --> 28:33.751
- I got out of the habit.
- Was it worth the slugging?

28:33.995 --> 28:35.064
Oh, not hard.

28:35.275 --> 28:38.790
There's too much slugging.
I don't believe in it.

28:39.035 --> 28:41.344
- I don't believe in it either.
- Good.

28:41.555 --> 28:44.194
- I learn fast.
- You're great, Miss Dawn.

28:44.435 --> 28:47.347
- Billie.
- Billie. An odd name, isn't it?

28:47.555 --> 28:49.910
Half the kids I know are named it.

28:50.115 --> 28:53.903
- Anyway, it isn't my real name.
- Oh? What is?

28:54.115 --> 28:56.629
Holy cats. Emma.

28:57.035 --> 29:00.550
- What's the matter?
- Do I look to you like an Emma?

29:00.955 --> 29:03.992
No. You don't look
like a Billie either.

29:04.635 --> 29:05.988
What do I look like?

29:06.235 --> 29:08.351
- To me?
- Yeah, you.

29:09.635 --> 29:12.354
You look like a lovely girl.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.346
Let me ask you...

29:19.435 --> 29:25.351
Are you one of these talkers, or would
you be interested in a little action?

29:25.595 --> 29:29.588
- What?
- I got a yen for you right off.

29:29.835 --> 29:33.305
- Well, do you get many?
- Now and then.

29:33.515 --> 29:36.712
- What do you do about it?
- You'll find out.

29:36.915 --> 29:40.794
- I will.
- Want a tip? Sweet-talk me, I like it.

29:41.035 --> 29:45.790
Like that " lovely girl" line.
Don't worry, he don't see a thing.

29:46.035 --> 29:48.788
He's too dizzy from being a big man.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.714
This is gonna be different
than I thought.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.031
- Do you mind?
- No.

29:54.235 --> 29:57.944
It's only fair.
We'll educate each other.

29:59.155 --> 30:00.827
- About those books.
- Yes?

30:01.155 --> 30:06.104
I'll look around. If there's anything
interesting, I'll drop it back.

30:06.315 --> 30:10.354
You can drop it back even
if it's not so interesting.

30:14.635 --> 30:18.947
- You two gonna get together?
- I think we're all set.

30:19.155 --> 30:23.512
- Great, great. Appreciate it.
- So do I.

30:23.715 --> 30:26.354
Well, I guess... I guess I'll be going.

30:28.795 --> 30:30.751
So long, kid!

30:33.635 --> 30:35.944
So long, kid.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.513
Gin!

32:44.315 --> 32:45.589
Forty-one.

32:45.835 --> 32:47.951
- Forty-one?
- Forty-one.

33:32.595 --> 33:36.190
Pay attention, that Verrall guy
can do you some good.

33:36.435 --> 33:38.153
All right.

33:42.515 --> 33:45.985
You're in the big league.
You should watch your step.

33:46.235 --> 33:48.146
All right.

33:50.995 --> 33:55.944
You gotta learn to fit in.
Can't have you around if you don't.

33:58.835 --> 34:01.588
Have to be careful
of what you do and say.

34:01.835 --> 34:03.348
Three.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.389
Twenty-eight.

34:10.594 --> 34:12.745
- Twenty-eight?
- Twenty-eight!

34:25.835 --> 34:29.225
You could use a little
education yourself.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.152
- Who asked you?
- Nobody.

34:31.355 --> 34:33.346
So shut up!

34:46.635 --> 34:50.150
- Can't I talk?
- Go on, play your cards.

34:57.835 --> 35:02.147
- It's a free country.
- That's what you think.

35:35.835 --> 35:37.188
Do you mind?!

35:41.595 --> 35:43.074
Gin.

35:49.635 --> 35:50.863
Thirty-four.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.754
- Thirty-four?
- Thirty-four!

35:58.915 --> 36:00.746
- Schneider!
- What?

36:00.955 --> 36:03.150
$55.60.

36:03.355 --> 36:06.188
- All right, that's enough.
- Pay me now.

36:06.435 --> 36:09.871
- Don't you trust me?
- Sore loser!

36:10.155 --> 36:11.668
Shut up!

36:12.835 --> 36:16.145
Fifty-five dollars and 60 cents.

36:41.555 --> 36:42.749
Thanks.

36:51.635 --> 36:55.184
- You gonna play like that all night?
- What?

37:05.275 --> 37:06.674
Hurt your eyes.

37:38.355 --> 37:39.549
- Hello.
- Hello.

37:39.795 --> 37:42.753
I tried your suite. No answer.

37:43.235 --> 37:45.544
Yeah, I know. I'm not in.

37:46.235 --> 37:50.911
- Morning papers.
- Oh, I don't read papers.

37:51.115 --> 37:54.790
- Never?
- Once in a while, the funnies.

37:54.995 --> 37:57.907
I think you should.
The not-so-funnies.

37:58.115 --> 37:59.104
Why?

37:59.315 --> 38:02.148
- Well, it's interesting.
- Not to me.

38:02.355 --> 38:03.913
How do you know?

38:04.115 --> 38:08.154
If you're gonna turn out
to be a pest, we can call it off.

38:08.355 --> 38:09.344
Sorry.

38:09.595 --> 38:13.907
I look at the papers sometimes,
but I never understand it.

38:14.115 --> 38:15.912
So what's the sense?

38:16.115 --> 38:19.994
Look through these, and anything
you don't understand...

38:20.195 --> 38:23.392
...make a circle around it.
Then I'll explain.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.103
- Whatever I can. All right?
- All right.

38:26.315 --> 38:29.512
And I thought you might like these.

38:30.035 --> 38:31.946
Well, I'll try.

38:33.155 --> 38:37.307
Start reading. If you don't
like it, start something else.

38:37.515 --> 38:40.109
One thing, my eyesight isn't so hot.

38:40.315 --> 38:42.385
Why don't you wear glasses?

38:42.595 --> 38:45.348
- Sure, why not?
- Because it's terrible.

39:00.915 --> 39:04.032
Of course, they're not so bad on men.

39:06.715 --> 39:09.946
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.554
Hello!

39:33.915 --> 39:35.553
Miss Dawn around?

39:37.515 --> 39:40.746
- Have you seen Miss Dawn?
- In her room.

39:44.995 --> 39:47.111
- Hello?
- Yes?

39:47.315 --> 39:50.113
- Ready to start.
- Come on up!

40:20.195 --> 40:23.949
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:27.195 --> 40:30.665
- Been reading, huh? That's good.
- Yeah.

40:30.915 --> 40:33.554
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

40:41.795 --> 40:45.151
- Did you have your breakfast yet?
- And lunch.

40:47.595 --> 40:51.349
- There's a few things here.
- Which?

41:05.835 --> 41:07.553
Read it out.

41:08.595 --> 41:10.551
You want me to read?

41:11.435 --> 41:14.188
Billie, things
are complicated enough...

41:14.395 --> 41:17.546
...without complicating them further.

41:19.515 --> 41:23.554
I ought to take this pencil
and make a circle around you.

41:27.875 --> 41:30.150
- Here are a few places you should see.
- A few?

41:30.355 --> 41:34.951
The Capitol. I'll tell you all I know,
then we'll join a tour.

41:35.155 --> 41:37.749
Senate's in session today.

41:37.995 --> 41:41.351
Let's go to the rotunda.
It's famous for its...

41:41.795 --> 41:45.674
- Come on. You'll find it interesting.
- I'm coming.

41:45.995 --> 41:47.587
- Now before Congress.

41:47.835 --> 41:52.750
On the walls of this rotunda
are eight historical paintings...

41:54.595 --> 41:57.792
- with the landing of the Pilgrims...

41:57.995 --> 42:01.465
- Revolutionary War paintings,
depicting the start...

42:01.675 --> 42:05.793
...and finish of that war,
and its two greatest battles.

42:05.995 --> 42:11.865
The east wall contains paintings
predating the Revolutionary period.

42:12.115 --> 42:15.994
- <i>The Glorification</i>
<i>of the Spirit of George Washington.</i>

42:16.195 --> 42:20.393
Washington is the figure
with the purple robe on his lap.

42:20.595 --> 42:25.464
The figures around him
represent Liberty and Victory.

42:25.675 --> 42:30.385
Brumidi did most of that work
lying on his back...

42:30.635 --> 42:34.514
...on a scaffold built
from the floor to the dome...

42:34.715 --> 42:38.674
...a distance of 180 feet
and 3 inches.

42:39.795 --> 42:41.786
Now if you'll follow me...

42:42.035 --> 42:45.550
How could anybody paint
upside down like that?

42:45.755 --> 42:48.553
Hey, give me one of those.

43:00.955 --> 43:02.752
- Hello.
- How are you?

43:56.235 --> 43:58.954
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

44:05.035 --> 44:07.026
There's the Constitution...

44:08.635 --> 44:12.753
...the Declaration of Independence.
And come here.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.986
And the Bill of Rights.
Know how old these are?

44:20.235 --> 44:23.591
- Oh, about 160 years.
- Who told you?

44:23.835 --> 44:27.145
- What else do you know about it?
- What else?

44:28.715 --> 44:31.354
- What else?
- This whole country...

44:31.555 --> 44:35.343
...is founded on these
three pieces of paper.

44:35.555 --> 44:37.944
This whole country?

44:41.755 --> 44:46.385
"The right of the people
to keep and bear arms...

44:46.635 --> 44:50.344
...shall not be in-fringed."
- Infringed.

44:50.995 --> 44:56.228
Good thing it's covered with glass.
I'd be making circles all over it.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.147
How about some ice cream?

45:00.955 --> 45:03.549
Anything but tutti-frutti.

45:05.235 --> 45:06.987
- How's chocolate?
- Fine.

45:07.195 --> 45:10.392
- I like you better with them on.
- What?

45:10.595 --> 45:12.551
Your glasses!

45:16.835 --> 45:20.305
Thanks. You know, chocolate's
the most popular.

45:20.515 --> 45:21.948
I read that.

45:22.715 --> 45:27.550
It's interesting how many things
a person could learn if they read.

45:28.155 --> 45:30.589
I don't suppose you read my piece.

45:30.835 --> 45:34.145
What are you talking?
Of course I read it. Twice.

45:34.355 --> 45:35.993
What did you think?

45:36.235 --> 45:41.070
It's the best thing I ever read.
I didn't understand one word.

45:42.035 --> 45:45.744
- What didn't you understand?
- None of it.

45:47.035 --> 45:49.151
Here. Show me what.

45:58.195 --> 46:01.790
What's so funny?
That I'm blind, practically?

46:02.195 --> 46:03.753
Practically blind.

46:03.955 --> 46:06.310
- Practically blind?
- You're wonderful.

46:06.515 --> 46:10.588
- I'm sorry I look funny to you.
- You look lovelier than ever.

46:10.795 --> 46:14.185
You sound like one of those
ads for eyeglasses.

46:14.435 --> 46:16.426
What didn't you understand?

46:16.635 --> 46:20.992
Well, like the name of it:
"The Yellowing Democratic Manifesto."

46:21.195 --> 46:25.154
- Simple.
- To who? Whom? Who?

46:25.635 --> 46:27.353
Well, anyway, not to me.

46:27.555 --> 46:30.786
- You know what "yellowing" means.
- Not this time.

46:30.995 --> 46:34.305
When a piece of paper gets old,
what happens to it?

46:34.715 --> 46:37.548
- Throw it away?
- No, it turns yellow.

46:37.755 --> 46:39.393
- It does?
- Of course.

46:39.595 --> 46:41.426
What do you know?

46:41.635 --> 46:45.423
- You know what " Democratic" means.
- Not Republican.

46:46.835 --> 46:49.030
Well, not exactly.

46:49.275 --> 46:53.791
It means pertaining to our form
of government, which is a democracy.

46:54.315 --> 46:57.785
- What's pertaining?
- " Has to do with."

46:58.035 --> 47:00.310
Pertaining. Nice word.

47:00.515 --> 47:03.188
- All right. " Manifesto."
- I don't know.

47:03.435 --> 47:06.871
- Why didn't you look it up?
- I did. I still don't know.

47:07.395 --> 47:11.752
By "manifesto" I mean the rules,
principles, ideals and hopes...

47:11.955 --> 47:14.549
...on which the United States is based.

47:14.755 --> 47:18.031
The ideas of the men who
wrote the Constitution.

47:18.235 --> 47:20.829
- You think it's turning yellow?
- Yes.

47:21.035 --> 47:24.232
The original inspiration
has been forgotten.

47:24.435 --> 47:27.188
- And that's bad?
- And that's bad.

47:30.595 --> 47:31.948
" Even a..."

47:32.235 --> 47:33.907
- " Cursory"?
- Cursory.

47:34.115 --> 47:37.232
"... examination of contemporary...

47:37.475 --> 47:40.035
...society in terms of the Greek...

47:40.235 --> 47:43.989
...philosophy, which defines
the whole as a representation...

47:44.195 --> 47:46.993
...of its parts,
sends one immediately...

47:47.235 --> 47:50.989
...to the consideration of
the individual as a citizen...

47:51.235 --> 47:54.113
...and the citizen as an individual."

47:54.315 --> 47:58.433
- Well?
- I looked up every word.

48:00.515 --> 48:01.948
Listen.

48:02.155 --> 48:05.545
Thousands of years ago,
a Greek philosopher said...

48:05.755 --> 48:09.065
...the world could only be
as good as its inhabitants.

48:09.275 --> 48:10.993
- Makes sense.
- So I said...

48:11.235 --> 48:12.987
...take one look at America...

48:13.235 --> 48:17.513
...and you figure you better look
at the people in it. One by one.

48:17.715 --> 48:19.194
That's all.

48:19.715 --> 48:22.183
- That's this?
- Sure.

48:22.395 --> 48:24.989
Well, why didn't you say so?

49:09.755 --> 49:15.387
- What's the name of this number?
- Beethoven's Second Symphony, Opus 36.

49:15.595 --> 49:19.747
I didn't ask you who made it up.
I just asked the name of it.

49:37.395 --> 49:39.386
Here. Wait a minute.

49:43.635 --> 49:45.785
- There.
- Thanks.

49:49.035 --> 49:52.152
- I can't get over it.
- Music that bad?

49:52.595 --> 49:56.793
- The music? Oh, it was swell.
- Well then, what?

49:57.195 --> 49:59.789
I got a letter today, from my father.

49:59.995 --> 50:01.269
- New York?
- Yeah.

50:01.515 --> 50:03.870
- I can't get over it.
- Why?

50:04.075 --> 50:07.670
It's the first time he wrote me
in about eight years.

50:07.915 --> 50:13.194
We had a fight, sort of.
He didn't want me to go with Harry.

50:13.395 --> 50:14.669
What does he do?

50:14.915 --> 50:16.394
- My father?
- Yeah.

50:16.595 --> 50:18.870
Gas company. He read metres...

50:19.115 --> 50:22.391
...but he can't get around
so good anymore...

50:22.595 --> 50:26.383
...so they gave him a different job.
Elevator man.

50:26.915 --> 50:30.271
He's a goofy old guy.
He used to take a frying pan...

50:30.475 --> 50:33.626
...to work every day
and cook his lunch.

50:33.875 --> 50:37.185
He said everybody
should have a hot lunch.

50:38.075 --> 50:40.066
I don't know how he did it.

50:40.275 --> 50:43.790
Four of us. Me and my three brothers.
He did everything.

50:43.995 --> 50:46.589
My mother died. I never knew her.

50:46.795 --> 50:51.073
He used to feed us and give us
our bath and buy our clothes.

50:51.315 --> 50:52.987
Everything.

50:54.035 --> 50:59.109
All my life I used to think how
someday I'd like to pay him back.

51:02.515 --> 51:05.188
It's funny how it worked out.

51:06.075 --> 51:11.388
Once I brought home $100 and gave it
to him. You know what he did?

51:14.115 --> 51:17.312
Well, it sure didn't
do the plumbing no good.

51:17.515 --> 51:23.192
I thought he'd hit me, but he didn't.
His whole life, he never hit me once.

51:24.075 --> 51:27.511
How'd he happen to write you,
after all this time?

51:27.715 --> 51:29.785
Because I wrote him.

51:30.235 --> 51:33.386
He says he's thought about me
every day.

51:34.115 --> 51:35.992
Gosh!

51:36.635 --> 51:42.187
I haven't thought about him,
I bet once even, in five years.

51:43.195 --> 51:47.666
Oh, that's nothing against him.
I haven't thought of anything.

51:48.115 --> 51:50.185
Be nice to see him, maybe.

51:50.715 --> 51:52.433
I guess so.

51:52.675 --> 51:57.590
He says I should write again, and
I should have a hot lunch every day.

51:57.795 --> 52:00.263
And I should let him know how I am.

52:00.515 --> 52:04.827
But he won't see me if I'm still
living in any way unethical.

52:05.035 --> 52:06.991
I looked it up.

52:07.235 --> 52:09.988
He always said, "Never do nothing...

52:10.195 --> 52:13.983
...you wouldn't want printed
in the <i>New York Times</i>."

52:16.075 --> 52:20.591
I practically told you the whole
story of my life by now.

52:21.075 --> 52:23.225
I enjoyed it very much.

52:23.555 --> 52:27.184
- How about the story of your life?
- Oh, no.

52:27.395 --> 52:29.386
Much too long...

52:30.315 --> 52:32.385
...and mostly untrue.

53:02.515 --> 53:07.305
This is even more gorgeous than
the Radio City Music Hall, even.

53:07.515 --> 53:10.393
And do you notice? It smells nice.

53:10.595 --> 53:12.233
It does!

53:17.235 --> 53:19.032
- Come on. Sit down.
- No.

53:19.235 --> 53:20.987
You're tired.

53:22.315 --> 53:24.783
I'm not a bit tired.

53:27.635 --> 53:28.829
See?

53:29.035 --> 53:31.913
You know the thing you gave me
about Napoleon?

53:32.115 --> 53:34.071
- What?
- By Robert G. Ingersoll?

53:34.315 --> 53:36.545
- Oh, yes.
- I'm not sure I get it.

53:36.755 --> 53:39.508
- There's no deep meaning.
- There must be.

53:39.715 --> 53:42.673
He goes and looks in Napoleon's tomb...

53:42.875 --> 53:45.708
...and he thinks
of Napoleon's sad life.

53:45.915 --> 53:50.545
And then he says he himself
would have rather been a happy farmer.

53:50.755 --> 53:56.591
" I would rather have been a French
peasant, and worn wooden shoes.

53:56.795 --> 54:01.471
I would rather have lived in a hut
with a vine growing over the door.

54:01.715 --> 54:05.788
And the grapes growing purple
in the kisses of the autumn sun.

54:06.595 --> 54:11.350
I would rather have been a poor
peasant, with my wife by my side...

54:11.555 --> 54:14.592
...knitting as the day
died out of the sky...

54:14.795 --> 54:18.993
...with my children upon my knee
and their arms about me.

54:19.475 --> 54:22.148
I would rather have been that man...

54:22.355 --> 54:26.587
...and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust...

54:26.795 --> 54:31.027
...than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder...

54:31.275 --> 54:33.789
...known as Napoleon the Great."

54:35.675 --> 54:38.985
How do you remember
all that stuff?

54:44.755 --> 54:48.873
So he'd rather be a happy peasant
than Napoleon. Who wouldn't?

54:49.075 --> 54:51.111
Harry wouldn't, for one.

54:51.315 --> 54:54.193
- What makes you think that?
- Ask him.

54:54.395 --> 54:56.863
He probably never heard
of Napoleon.

54:57.115 --> 55:00.790
What's worse, he probably never
heard of a peasant.

55:02.195 --> 55:04.072
Do you hate him like poison?

55:04.315 --> 55:05.873
- Who? Harry?
- Yeah.

55:06.115 --> 55:07.787
- No.
- You don't like him.

55:07.995 --> 55:09.189
No.

55:09.435 --> 55:12.905
- On account of me and him?
- One reason. There are lots more.

55:13.115 --> 55:16.505
- What?
- Think about it. Harry's a menace.

55:16.715 --> 55:19.070
He's not so bad. I seen worse.

55:19.275 --> 55:22.028
Has he ever thought of anyone
but himself?

55:22.235 --> 55:23.588
Who does?

55:23.795 --> 55:27.071
History is the story
of the struggle between...

55:27.275 --> 55:30.631
...the selfish and the unselfish.
- I can hear you.

55:30.875 --> 55:33.628
All that's bad is bred by selfishness.

55:33.835 --> 55:38.192
Sometimes selfishness can get to be
a cause, an organized force.

55:38.395 --> 55:41.512
Even a government.
Then it's called fascism.

55:41.795 --> 55:44.867
- Can you understand that?
- Sort of.

55:45.075 --> 55:49.512
- Well, think about it.
- You're crazy about me, aren't you?

55:49.715 --> 55:52.912
- Yes.
- That's why you get so mad at Harry.

55:53.475 --> 55:57.832
I hate his life, what he does,
what he stands for. Not him.

55:58.075 --> 56:02.990
- He just doesn't know any better.
- I go for you too.

56:04.155 --> 56:06.191
I'm glad of it.

56:20.715 --> 56:24.105
" I've sworn upon the altar of God...

56:24.315 --> 56:29.230
...eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny...

56:30.235 --> 56:32.590
...over the mind of man."

56:35.115 --> 56:38.232
So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh?

56:38.435 --> 56:40.710
I heard quite a bit about him.

56:40.915 --> 56:43.987
I mean even before
I hit town, even.

56:54.755 --> 56:56.188
Come in.

57:01.595 --> 57:04.553
What are you trying to do
with those books, hatch them?

57:06.515 --> 57:07.584
Blue?

57:09.995 --> 57:11.394
Nice, that.

57:12.315 --> 57:15.193
Beethoven. Op 36.

57:16.955 --> 57:20.789
- What's up?
- It's because of you I'm doing this.

57:21.035 --> 57:23.185
- I guess you know.
- No, I didn't.

57:23.755 --> 57:28.590
A lot of good it did me.
I never had this trouble before.

57:29.235 --> 57:31.544
- Trouble?
- Sure.

57:31.755 --> 57:35.953
When I met you, I figured everything
is gonna work out dandy.

57:36.155 --> 57:39.625
Then when you wouldn't
step across the line...

57:39.875 --> 57:43.470
...I figured maybe the way
to you is through your head.

57:44.555 --> 57:45.988
Well, no.

57:47.835 --> 57:51.191
Well, anyway, what's the diff now?
Difference.

57:51.435 --> 57:55.110
But I like you anyway.
It's too late for the rest.

57:55.315 --> 57:58.034
- Why?
- Why?

57:58.275 --> 58:01.824
There's a certain time
between a fellow and a girl...

58:02.075 --> 58:06.512
...when it either comes off or not.
If it doesn't then, it never does.

58:06.715 --> 58:12.347
- Maybe we haven't got to our time yet.
- I think so. You dropped the ball.

58:12.555 --> 58:14.113
Don't be so sure.

58:14.795 --> 58:18.105
I never thought I'd
go through a thing like this.

58:18.315 --> 58:21.352
- Like what?
- Like getting all mixed-up.

58:21.555 --> 58:25.628
Like wondering and worrying
and thinking. Stuff like that.

58:25.835 --> 58:30.750
Last night I started thinking.
I couldn't fall asleep for 10 minutes!

58:31.035 --> 58:34.744
I don't know if it's good
to find out so much so quick.

58:34.955 --> 58:39.710
Nobody's born smart. Know what
the stupidest thing on earth is? A baby.

58:39.915 --> 58:41.985
What have you got against babies?

58:42.235 --> 58:46.148
I've got nothing against a brain
that's three weeks old.

58:46.355 --> 58:49.950
But if it's still empty after
30 years, I begin to wonder.

58:50.155 --> 58:52.589
- Who says I'm 30?
- I didn't...

58:52.795 --> 58:54.114
- You did!
- I swear.

58:54.315 --> 58:56.624
- You sure can get me sore.
- Sorry.

58:56.835 --> 58:58.746
- Do I look 30 to you?
- No.

58:58.955 --> 59:01.628
- Then why'd you say it?
- I don't know.

59:01.835 --> 59:04.588
- How old are you?
- Twenty-nine!

59:08.595 --> 59:10.233
Don't stop.

59:10.435 --> 59:12.585
I meant, don't stop studying.

59:13.155 --> 59:14.588
Will you?

59:15.235 --> 59:18.113
I don't know why
it's so important to you.

59:18.315 --> 59:21.148
Sort of a cause.
I want everyone to be smart.

59:21.355 --> 59:23.391
As smart as they can be.

59:23.635 --> 59:26.308
A world of ignorant people
is dangerous.

59:26.515 --> 59:31.714
- That's why I wish I was doing better.
- You're doing wonderfully.

59:31.915 --> 59:35.988
Most people would laugh
if they knew what I was trying...

59:36.235 --> 59:40.706
- I'm not laughing.
- I am. I'm sort of laughing at myself.

59:40.915 --> 59:43.588
Who do I think I am, anyway?

59:50.075 --> 59:52.305
Once in a while, for a change.

59:52.515 --> 59:55.632
Don't try so hard.
You miss the whole point.

59:55.875 --> 59:59.948
- I wanna like what's best to like.
- You have room for a lot.

01:00:00.075 --> 01:00:02.305
One learns to be bigger, not smaller.

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:04.625
- I'm getting bigger?
- Yes.

01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:06.786
Glad to hear it.

01:00:07.115 --> 01:00:08.912
But all them books!

01:00:09.115 --> 01:00:11.709
I told you, it's not only books.

01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:13.746
- It's mostly.
- It is not.

01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:17.152
Who said, "The proper study
of mankind is man"?

01:00:17.355 --> 01:00:18.788
- Who?
- You should know.

01:00:18.995 --> 01:00:19.984
- Why?
- I told you.

01:00:20.155 --> 01:00:21.383
- I forgot.
- Pope.

01:00:21.595 --> 01:00:25.144
- The pope?
- Not "the pope." Alexander Pope.

01:00:26.995 --> 01:00:29.634
- "The proper study..."
- "... of mankind is man."

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:32.833
- Of course, that means women too.
- Yes.

01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:34.588
Yes, I know.

01:00:35.355 --> 01:00:38.506
I've been studying
different mankind lately.

01:00:38.715 --> 01:00:43.186
Like the ones you told me.
Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:46.745
And all by myself
I got to thinking about Harry.

01:00:47.195 --> 01:00:50.983
He works so hard
to get what he wants, for instance.

01:00:51.195 --> 01:00:53.550
But he doesn't know what he wants.

01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:56.747
- More of what he's got, probably.
- Money.

01:00:56.955 --> 01:01:00.504
Money, more people to push around,
more money.

01:01:00.715 --> 01:01:03.468
He's not so bad as you think he is.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.386
We were just talking about you.

01:01:07.635 --> 01:01:12.151
That ain't why I pay you.
She knows enough about me. Too much.

01:01:12.355 --> 01:01:14.915
Jim phone? I had a date with him.

01:01:15.115 --> 01:01:17.629
- What about Paine?
- He was quite a fellow.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:21.584
- Where was he born?
- London or England. A place like that.

01:01:21.795 --> 01:01:24.912
- London or...? It's the same thing.
- It is?

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:28.790
London's a city
in the country of England.

01:01:28.995 --> 01:01:30.951
- You got patience.
- Take it easy.

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:34.591
- How can she be so dumb?
- We can't all know everything.

01:01:34.835 --> 01:01:37.793
- Who's Tom Paine, for instance?
- What?

01:01:38.035 --> 01:01:41.232
- You heard me. Tom Paine.
- What do I care?

01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:42.424
I know.

01:01:42.635 --> 01:01:46.389
If I wanted to know who he is,
I'd know. I don't care.

01:01:46.595 --> 01:01:49.746
- Don't let me butt in.
- Which book did you like?

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:53.425
I didn't read by him.
Only about him. I made a list.

01:01:53.675 --> 01:01:55.984
- Who's " Rabbit" Maranville?
- Who?

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.914
- " Rabbit" Maranville.
- I don't know rabbits.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:02.994
- Think you're smart, huh?
- He was shortstop for the Braves.

01:02:03.235 --> 01:02:05.908
- What are you? Some kind of genius?
- No.

01:02:06.115 --> 01:02:09.027
- I hire and fire geniuses every day.
- I'm sure.

01:02:09.235 --> 01:02:10.953
- Where's the list?
- Here.

01:02:11.155 --> 01:02:14.192
Suppose you start
with <i>The Age of Reason</i>.

01:02:14.435 --> 01:02:16.630
- <i>The Age of Reason</i> ?
- Then, next...

01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:19.429
- Who's Willie Hop?
- Billiard champion.

01:02:19.675 --> 01:02:22.394
- It's pronounced " Hoppe."
- I asked her.

01:02:22.595 --> 01:02:25.587
- Sorry. Where were we?
- <i>The Age of Reason</i>.

01:02:25.835 --> 01:02:29.032
- Yes. Next, <i>The Rights of Man</i>.
- <i>The Rights of Man</i>.

01:02:29.275 --> 01:02:31.391
- I think...
- What's a peninsula?

01:02:31.635 --> 01:02:34.593
You think you're so smart?
What's a peninsula?

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:38.748
- Not you. Her.
- It's that new medicine.

01:02:40.955 --> 01:02:42.388
It is not.

01:02:43.275 --> 01:02:45.345
- What then?
- A body of land...

01:02:45.555 --> 01:02:47.944
...surrounded on three sides
by water.

01:02:48.155 --> 01:02:50.988
- So what?
- So what about Sam Paine?

01:02:51.195 --> 01:02:54.710
Some difference between...
Tom Paine! Not Sam Paine!

01:02:54.915 --> 01:02:58.988
Tom Paine practically started
this whole country.

01:02:59.795 --> 01:03:01.831
- You mean he's dead?
- Of course.

01:03:02.075 --> 01:03:05.704
I want you to learn her how to act
with live people.

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:08.554
Education's difficult to control...

01:03:08.755 --> 01:03:10.791
- Work on her.
- No extra charge.

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:14.112
- I don't need nothing you can tell me.
- We could...

01:03:14.315 --> 01:03:17.034
...tell each other some
interesting things.

01:03:17.235 --> 01:03:19.385
- What's the idea?
- Being friendly.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.948
Who asked you?

01:03:21.315 --> 01:03:23.909
The more I see you
I don't like you as much.

01:03:24.115 --> 01:03:25.992
You're awful fresh.

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:30.194
- Watch out. I got my eye on you.
- Okay. We'll both watch out.

01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:33.711
- I could knock your block off.
- Yes, I know.

01:03:33.915 --> 01:03:37.146
Just do what you're supposed
to do, that's all.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.549
We'll stop now.

01:03:38.755 --> 01:03:41.906
- Go on. I wanna see how you do it.
- Not now.

01:03:42.115 --> 01:03:45.585
I've gotta lie down.
You don't realize how hard I work.

01:03:45.795 --> 01:03:46.989
Some joke!

01:03:47.235 --> 01:03:51.945
- 200 bucks a week and I can't watch.
- Take you on separately. Glad to.

01:03:52.155 --> 01:03:55.591
Got a special course
for backward millionaires.

01:04:01.235 --> 01:04:06.184
" London or England."
Why don't you give up?

01:04:16.715 --> 01:04:18.945
- Harry?
- What?

01:04:19.595 --> 01:04:23.554
What's this business we're in
down here? Could you tell me?

01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:25.347
What do you mean, "we"?

01:04:25.555 --> 01:04:29.184
- I figure I'm a partner, in a way.
- A silent partner.

01:04:29.435 --> 01:04:31.790
- So?
- So shut up.

01:04:33.355 --> 01:04:35.027
I got a right to know.

01:04:35.235 --> 01:04:38.193
Keep out of my hair.
Put your nose in a book.

01:04:38.395 --> 01:04:41.432
I don't want to do anything
against the law.

01:04:41.635 --> 01:04:43.114
Do what I tell you.

01:04:43.315 --> 01:04:46.193
I think I know what it is,
only I'm not sure.

01:04:46.395 --> 01:04:48.829
What's the matter?
You do all right.

01:04:49.075 --> 01:04:51.635
Something you want
you ain't got, maybe?

01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:57.589
- What?
- I wanna be like the happy peasant.

01:04:58.555 --> 01:05:02.912
All right, I'll buy it for you.
Now will you quit crabbing?

01:05:03.635 --> 01:05:06.786
I finished finally.
Thanks loads for the loan.

01:05:06.995 --> 01:05:09.190
- How'd you like it?
- Oh, not me.

01:05:09.395 --> 01:05:13.308
I don't like when everyone
has a beef against the world.

01:05:13.515 --> 01:05:17.224
- I like to look on the cheerful side.
- Well, the point...

01:05:17.475 --> 01:05:22.754
- Can the coffee klatch. You, knock off.
- Sorry, Mr. Brock.

01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:26.394
- Don't get so pally.
- Paul says it's okay.

01:05:26.635 --> 01:05:29.991
- Never mind him. I don't like it.
- Know what you are?

01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:31.389
What?

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:43.472
- Antisocial!
- You can say that again.

01:05:44.355 --> 01:05:46.027
Where you guys been?

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.947
- Sorry.
- You're always sorry.

01:05:48.155 --> 01:05:51.033
- My fault. How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:05:51.235 --> 01:05:55.547
- How are you, Billie?
- Superb. A new word.

01:05:56.435 --> 01:05:59.984
- All right, what happened?
- It may take more time...

01:06:00.195 --> 01:06:01.867
- And more money.
- Why more?

01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:04.953
The amendment has to be redrafted.

01:06:07.115 --> 01:06:11.393
- You make me feel like a sucker.
- Norval's doing his best.

01:06:11.595 --> 01:06:14.985
- It ain't good enough.
- There are a lot of votes.

01:06:15.195 --> 01:06:17.993
- Norval's just one guy.
- He's the wrong guy.

01:06:19.555 --> 01:06:21.307
I'm sick of waiting.

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:25.986
Pull your weight in this deal
or I'll get somebody who can.

01:06:27.555 --> 01:06:29.034
Quite a temper.

01:06:29.275 --> 01:06:34.793
Don't mind him. He's always lived
at the top of his voice. So long, Norval.

01:06:48.235 --> 01:06:52.433
Harry shouldn't talk to you like that.
You're a congressman.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.869
Oh, well.

01:06:54.075 --> 01:06:58.546
No one should talk to a congressman
like that, or be able to.

01:06:59.035 --> 01:07:02.994
- Being a congressman is wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:07:03.235 --> 01:07:05.590
I think I could use a drink.

01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:09.151
Oh, sure, congressman. Come on in.

01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:14.631
If he pushes you around, he's
pushing a few million people around.

01:07:14.955 --> 01:07:17.025
- Who?
- The ones who picked you.

01:07:17.275 --> 01:07:19.550
- Not quite that many.
- How many?

01:07:19.755 --> 01:07:22.827
306,434.

01:07:23.075 --> 01:07:25.987
That's quite a few to push around.

01:07:26.195 --> 01:07:30.586
You're not one of my constituents
by any chance, are you?

01:07:37.475 --> 01:07:41.912
- One of the people who voted for me?
- Oh, I never voted for anybody.

01:07:42.115 --> 01:07:44.345
- Why not?
- I wouldn't know how.

01:07:44.555 --> 01:07:48.389
- Simple. You just press a button.
- Yeah. But which one?

01:07:48.595 --> 01:07:53.988
You listen to the speeches.
You make up your own mind. That's all.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:56.390
Why do you take it from Harry?

01:07:56.595 --> 01:08:00.588
You're more important than him.
You're a congressman.

01:08:00.795 --> 01:08:03.992
Yes, and as such,
I have a great many duties...

01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:06.954
...and responsibilities and...

01:08:07.235 --> 01:08:10.386
The operation of government
is very complex.

01:08:10.635 --> 01:08:15.345
Why should it be? I understand it in
the books, and when Paul tells me.

01:08:15.555 --> 01:08:18.706
But when I see this
happen, it's different.

01:08:18.915 --> 01:08:20.109
How?

01:08:20.314 --> 01:08:24.831
When it's a matter of the law,
is Harry more important than others?

01:08:24.995 --> 01:08:25.984
No.

01:08:26.115 --> 01:08:30.791
Then how come he's got so much to say?
Who ever voted for him?

01:08:34.475 --> 01:08:38.593
Well, we'll have a nice,
long talk about it sometime.

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:41.987
All right.

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:44.430
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:08:44.635 --> 01:08:46.386
And thank you.

01:08:55.595 --> 01:08:57.586
Quite a little girl.

01:08:59.995 --> 01:09:01.553
- Billie?
- Come in.

01:09:01.755 --> 01:09:05.794
Will you come inside?
A few things for you.

01:09:14.955 --> 01:09:17.389
Sign those, will you, honey?

01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:22.549
- What is this?
- Same old stuff.

01:09:22.755 --> 01:09:26.191
- What?
- Take too long to explain.

01:09:26.435 --> 01:09:30.826
I like having things explained
to me. I found that out.

01:09:31.075 --> 01:09:33.794
- Some other time.
- Now.

01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:38.193
- It's an agreement about a merger.
- Merger?

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:42.109
- What's that?
- Several companies becoming one.

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:44.305
- All Harry's?
- No.

01:09:44.515 --> 01:09:45.584
Whose, then?

01:09:45.795 --> 01:09:49.787
A few of Harry's and some others.
French, Italian and so on.

01:09:49.995 --> 01:09:51.951
A cartel!

01:09:53.395 --> 01:09:56.705
- What are you talking about?
- Cartels. I'm against it.

01:09:56.915 --> 01:09:58.507
Paul explained it to me.

01:09:58.715 --> 01:10:01.707
- It's perfectly all right.
- Are you sure?

01:10:01.915 --> 01:10:03.394
- Ask Harry.
- I will.

01:10:03.635 --> 01:10:05.307
- He won't like it.
- Why not?

01:10:05.515 --> 01:10:09.030
- He doesn't like people butting in.
- I'm not " people."

01:10:09.275 --> 01:10:10.913
Listen to me. Be smart.

01:10:11.115 --> 01:10:14.027
How can I be smart if nobody
tells me anything?

01:10:14.235 --> 01:10:15.668
I'll tell you something.

01:10:15.835 --> 01:10:18.952
- Sign this. Don't start with him.
- Tomorrow.

01:10:19.195 --> 01:10:20.184
Why tomorrow?

01:10:20.435 --> 01:10:23.233
- I wanna look it over.
- It's all right.

01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:25.984
Must be fishy or you'd tell me.

01:10:26.235 --> 01:10:27.953
Take my word for it.

01:10:29.435 --> 01:10:30.663
No.

01:10:31.035 --> 01:10:34.948
I know you feel bad.
You don't like doing his dirty work.

01:10:35.155 --> 01:10:38.591
- You know you're better than him.
- That's enough!

01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:42.788
But I'm not so sure.
Maybe you're worse.

01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:44.344
- Interesting?
- Not very.

01:11:44.755 --> 01:11:47.792
You're used to reading
more high-toned stuff.

01:11:48.035 --> 01:11:49.946
Yes, I am.

01:11:50.355 --> 01:11:52.550
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.

01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:55.747
- All of a sudden...
- I don't like that Jim.

01:11:55.955 --> 01:11:58.788
Why? What'd he do to you?

01:11:59.035 --> 01:12:02.710
He didn't do anything to me.
It's what he's done to himself.

01:12:02.915 --> 01:12:04.143
Done what?

01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:09.145
Paul said he could have been Assistant
Attorney General of the United States.

01:12:09.435 --> 01:12:12.029
- Who?
- Jim.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:17.185
- So what's wrong with that?
- So nothing's wrong. Look at him now.

01:12:17.395 --> 01:12:20.785
Hangs around. Helps you promote.

01:12:20.995 --> 01:12:25.147
Lets you walk all over him
just because you pay him.

01:12:25.715 --> 01:12:28.707
So we finally get around to me.

01:12:30.035 --> 01:12:35.587
I'm not sure I like you, either.
You're selfish, that's your trouble.

01:12:35.835 --> 01:12:39.145
- Since when is all this?
- Since now.

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:44.788
I used to think you were a big man.
I'm beginning to see you're not.

01:12:45.035 --> 01:12:49.074
Through history there's been bigger
men than you. Now too.

01:12:49.275 --> 01:12:50.594
- Who?
- Thousands.

01:12:50.795 --> 01:12:52.547
Name one.

01:12:52.915 --> 01:12:54.553
My father.

01:12:55.355 --> 01:12:57.550
Twenty-five a week.

01:12:58.435 --> 01:13:01.586
Don't get nervous just because
you read a book.

01:13:01.795 --> 01:13:04.184
- You're as dumb as ever.
- Think so?

01:13:04.435 --> 01:13:08.633
Yeah, but I don't mind. You know why?
Because you're the greatest...

01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:10.826
- Leave me alone!
- Come here!

01:13:11.075 --> 01:13:14.431
- I feel like I wanna go away someplace!
- Where?

01:13:14.635 --> 01:13:17.149
- We'll go to Florida.
- I mean alone.

01:13:17.355 --> 01:13:19.915
- You've gone nuts! Calm down!
- I can't!

01:13:20.115 --> 01:13:21.707
- Why not?
- I don't know!

01:13:21.915 --> 01:13:24.793
I hate my life.
There's a better kind.

01:13:25.035 --> 01:13:29.984
If you'd read some books you'd know.
Maybe you're right. I'm still dumb.

01:13:30.235 --> 01:13:34.786
But I know there's a better
kind of life than the one I got.

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:36.946
Or you!

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:40.787
You'd rather be with
that saxophone player?

01:13:40.995 --> 01:13:43.714
- At least he was honest!
- He was a chump.

01:13:43.915 --> 01:13:47.112
- He worked for a living.
- I worked since I was 12.

01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:50.785
- Nobody give me nothing.
- Robbing a house is work too.

01:13:50.995 --> 01:13:53.145
In my whole life...!

01:13:58.355 --> 01:14:00.585
I never robbed a house in my life!

01:14:00.795 --> 01:14:03.992
- What are you talking about?
- You can't understand.

01:14:04.195 --> 01:14:06.584
Get off that high horse,
you dumb pot!

01:14:06.795 --> 01:14:07.989
You...

01:14:08.195 --> 01:14:09.753
...menace!

01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:14.587
You never had a decent meal
until you met me!

01:14:14.795 --> 01:14:17.992
But I had to eat with you!
You got no manners.

01:14:18.235 --> 01:14:22.114
Taking your shoes off all the time
and picking your teeth.

01:14:22.315 --> 01:14:24.749
You're just not couth!

01:14:31.395 --> 01:14:33.750
I'm as couth as you are!

01:14:35.835 --> 01:14:39.225
- And that cheap perfume you put on.
- Cheap?

01:14:39.435 --> 01:14:42.905
I don't own nothing cheap except you.

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:47.354
You don't own me. Nobody can
own anybody. The law says.

01:14:47.555 --> 01:14:50.991
- If I was scared, I wouldn't be here.
- Where are you?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:54.346
You don't like it here, beat it!

01:14:56.355 --> 01:14:59.392
- Wait a minute! First this.
- Not now.

01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:00.784
- Right now!
- No!

01:15:01.035 --> 01:15:04.345
I won't sign anything
till I know what it is.

01:15:04.635 --> 01:15:06.944
Do what I'm telling you!

01:15:08.635 --> 01:15:10.751
Harry, please don't!

01:15:17.035 --> 01:15:18.548
There.

01:15:32.235 --> 01:15:34.544
All right, now go on. Blow.

01:15:35.275 --> 01:15:39.553
I don't want you bawling here.
You don't appreciate nothing.

01:15:39.755 --> 01:15:45.148
Go sit on a park bench until you learn
how to behave. Go on, beat it!

01:15:48.355 --> 01:15:50.346
This way out.

01:15:50.835 --> 01:15:52.507
I gotta put something on.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:56.344
Hurry up. I don't want you around.
You bother me!

01:16:00.235 --> 01:16:02.954
Big fascist!

01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:26.953
All set?

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:30.792
You think I'm gonna
let a broad talk back?

01:16:31.035 --> 01:16:35.187
- Where is she?
- She's leaving. I can't stand a crier.

01:16:35.435 --> 01:16:38.347
- What's she crying about?
- How do I know?

01:16:39.475 --> 01:16:41.272
Becoming a strange girl.

01:16:41.475 --> 01:16:44.990
She's all right. It's these books.
They got her nervous.

01:16:45.235 --> 01:16:47.544
Educating her was a mistake.

01:16:47.755 --> 01:16:52.545
I didn't know it would be like this.
I'll fire that Verrall skunk.

01:16:52.755 --> 01:16:53.710
Why blame him?

01:16:53.915 --> 01:16:59.592
He taught her too much. You know
what she called me? A "fatch-ist"!

01:16:59.795 --> 01:17:04.346
That don't make sense. I was born
in New Jersey. She knows that.

01:17:06.635 --> 01:17:08.751
What's the matter, Harry?

01:17:12.515 --> 01:17:14.949
I love that broad.

01:17:16.515 --> 01:17:21.350
You think we could find somebody
to make her dumb again?

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:32.745
Don't be late if you don't
want no bloody nose.

01:17:35.235 --> 01:17:38.705
- Would you do me a favour, Harry?
- What?

01:17:38.915 --> 01:17:41.349
Drop dead.

01:18:32.915 --> 01:18:36.954
<i>I have sworn upon the altar of God...</i>

01:18:37.435 --> 01:18:39.869
<i>... eternal hostility...</i>

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:43.546
<i>... against every form of tyranny...</i>

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:47.314
<i>... over the mind of man.</i>

01:19:02.395 --> 01:19:04.784
Oh, hello. Chestnut-7180.

01:19:05.035 --> 01:19:08.744
I'd like to speak to
Thomas Jefferson, please.

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:12.351
Oh, no. I mean Thomas Verrall.

01:19:13.635 --> 01:19:16.513
No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.

01:19:16.715 --> 01:19:19.149
Well, it's very important.

01:19:20.435 --> 01:19:22.744
Well, I'll hold on.

01:19:33.355 --> 01:19:35.186
- Jim!
- Yes?

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:37.113
- What time is it?
- 11:30.

01:19:37.315 --> 01:19:40.068
- I'll slug her when she gets back.
- If.

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:44.951
- She always winds up where I want her.
- I hope so.

01:20:01.515 --> 01:20:02.391
Jim!

01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:04.273
- What time is it?
- 11:30.

01:20:04.475 --> 01:20:07.831
- You said that before.
- 11:31.

01:20:08.235 --> 01:20:12.945
- She's been gone eight hours.
- Maybe she's seeing a double feature.

01:20:13.155 --> 01:20:15.953
That don't take eight hours.

01:20:16.435 --> 01:20:18.995
- Could've had an accident.
- You'd hear.

01:20:19.235 --> 01:20:22.386
Could have got attacked.
Happens all the time.

01:20:22.635 --> 01:20:27.151
Not to Billie. Maybe the other
way around. But not to her.

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:42.029
She here?

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:44.544
What do you mean?
No. Look some more.

01:20:44.755 --> 01:20:47.792
- I been all over town.
- Well, go over it again.

01:20:47.995 --> 01:20:52.910
- Do what I'm telling you.
- Sure. Just changing my socks.

01:20:54.835 --> 01:20:56.393
- Harry.
- What?

01:20:56.635 --> 01:20:58.546
Marry her.

01:20:59.635 --> 01:21:00.954
Still harping?

01:21:01.155 --> 01:21:03.874
I'm thinking of your legal safety.
She...

01:21:04.075 --> 01:21:05.906
I know what she owns.

01:21:06.115 --> 01:21:08.310
You've got to do it, Harry.

01:21:08.515 --> 01:21:13.350
Broads always hook you in the end.
All this because a dame reads a book.

01:21:13.555 --> 01:21:16.911
It's the new world.
Force and reason changing places.

01:21:17.115 --> 01:21:19.504
- What?
- Knowledge is power.

01:21:19.715 --> 01:21:23.185
I don't like this. You stewed,
that broad out of line.

01:21:23.435 --> 01:21:26.154
- And some congressman!
- I think he's cute.

01:21:26.355 --> 01:21:27.993
I'd like to trade him in.

01:21:28.195 --> 01:21:30.106
- On what?
- On a senator!

01:21:30.315 --> 01:21:31.794
On a senator?

01:21:32.035 --> 01:21:36.586
Take the blinders off and let in
the light. Just for a second.

01:21:36.795 --> 01:21:41.585
You can't buy senators and congressmen
as if they wore price tags.

01:21:41.835 --> 01:21:45.350
These guys are honest.
Sincerely trying to do a job.

01:21:45.715 --> 01:21:49.503
Sometimes you find
a rotten apple, like Hedges.

01:21:49.715 --> 01:21:53.549
But just once in a while.
In a great while.

01:22:25.435 --> 01:22:29.508
Are you sure you're ringing
Mr. Brock's suite, operator?

01:22:29.715 --> 01:22:32.275
Well, how about the bedroom?

01:22:32.795 --> 01:22:35.514
Ring a few more times.
I wanna make sure.

01:22:35.715 --> 01:22:38.707
- He's not in.
- Just one more ring.

01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:42.114
Let's go.

01:22:52.795 --> 01:22:55.389
The stuff's in his briefcase.

01:22:55.595 --> 01:22:57.551
In his bedroom.

01:22:59.995 --> 01:23:03.192
I probably won't see you again, Paul.

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:05.306
- I wanna say goodbye.
- What?

01:23:05.515 --> 01:23:08.154
- And thanks.
- Where are you going?

01:23:08.355 --> 01:23:11.950
- Away from here, that's all I know.
- Where?

01:23:12.715 --> 01:23:14.387
You can tell me.

01:23:14.595 --> 01:23:18.747
I don't know. I thought
I might go see my father for a while.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:21.589
- I've got a better idea.
- What?

01:23:21.795 --> 01:23:23.945
Let's get married.

01:23:25.435 --> 01:23:28.154
You must be daffy.

01:23:28.835 --> 01:23:31.030
I love you, Billie.

01:23:32.715 --> 01:23:35.752
You don't love me.
You just love my brain.

01:23:35.995 --> 01:23:37.553
That too.

01:23:38.395 --> 01:23:43.310
I'll think it over, but I can
tell you now, the answer's no.

01:23:49.035 --> 01:23:51.265
What are you doing?

01:23:51.475 --> 01:23:54.672
If you don't know,
I must be doing it wrong.

01:24:08.635 --> 01:24:10.546
Fine time!

01:24:14.835 --> 01:24:17.554
- Hello, Harry.
- Where you been?

01:24:17.795 --> 01:24:21.470
I took a walk, like you told me.
I met Paul.

01:24:21.675 --> 01:24:24.143
Okay, buster, knock off.

01:24:26.515 --> 01:24:28.107
Good night, Paul.

01:24:28.515 --> 01:24:31.507
Good night, Billie.
Good night, Harry.

01:24:32.795 --> 01:24:36.231
What's the matter, Harry?
You miss me?

01:24:51.955 --> 01:24:54.788
I got something to say
and I don't like to wait.

01:24:54.995 --> 01:24:55.871
I know.

01:24:56.075 --> 01:24:58.509
- Now I'm not so sure.
- Why not?

01:24:58.715 --> 01:25:02.151
Talking fresh, slamming doors.
I knew you'd be back.

01:25:02.395 --> 01:25:04.750
- You did?
- Jim was worried, not me.

01:25:04.995 --> 01:25:06.713
Not yet.

01:25:07.075 --> 01:25:10.192
- What took you so long?
- I had a lot to think.

01:25:10.395 --> 01:25:12.955
- For instance?
- Where I stand around here.

01:25:13.155 --> 01:25:14.986
- I'm trying to tell you.
- What?

01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:16.463
Where you stand.

01:25:16.675 --> 01:25:20.145
First, Verrall is out.
I don't like to see you upset.

01:25:20.395 --> 01:25:22.511
- Next, we'll get married.
- No.

01:25:22.715 --> 01:25:24.865
But you gotta behave...
No?

01:25:25.075 --> 01:25:28.545
- What do you mean, " no"?
- I don't wanna, that's what.

01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:33.510
- In fact, I've never been so insulted!
- Who are you to say no?

01:25:33.715 --> 01:25:37.947
Don't knock yourself out.
You got a lot of surprises coming.

01:25:42.515 --> 01:25:44.073
- Just tell me.
- What?

01:25:44.275 --> 01:25:47.665
- How can you not wanna marry me?
- For one, you're dumb.

01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:52.744
I got a different kind of life in mind.
Sorry, you wouldn't fit in.

01:25:52.995 --> 01:25:55.509
- I don't understand!
- I do.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:57.307
What did I do?

01:25:57.515 --> 01:26:02.145
I talked rough to you. Maybe I hit you
a couple of times. Easy.

01:26:02.395 --> 01:26:05.148
Is that any reason
to treat me like this?

01:26:05.435 --> 01:26:08.507
I done good too.
Can't we straighten it out?

01:26:08.715 --> 01:26:10.307
- No.
- Why not?

01:26:10.555 --> 01:26:15.993
All that stuff I've been studying,
it just mixed me up.

01:26:16.195 --> 01:26:18.106
But when you hit me before...

01:26:18.315 --> 01:26:22.991
...it was like it all knocked
together in my head and made sense.

01:26:23.235 --> 01:26:24.953
I realized what it means.

01:26:25.195 --> 01:26:30.144
How some people are always giving it,
and some taking. And it's not fair.

01:26:30.395 --> 01:26:34.513
So I'm not gonna let you anymore.
Or anybody else.

01:26:36.435 --> 01:26:39.905
Listen, kid. I got an idea.
You wanna come to Florida?

01:26:41.915 --> 01:26:45.544
We used to have some good times
together. Remember?

01:26:45.995 --> 01:26:48.748
I think you should
marry me. Don't you?

01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:53.346
I want you to marry me.
Do what I tell you or you'll be sorry.

01:26:53.595 --> 01:26:58.510
- I'm not scared of you anymore, Harry.
- You're not, huh?

01:27:01.355 --> 01:27:04.074
- And something else. I'm leaving.
- What?

01:27:04.275 --> 01:27:05.708
For good.

01:27:06.075 --> 01:27:08.350
You just can't walk out.

01:27:08.595 --> 01:27:12.713
You're in too deep. I was wrong
hooking you in, but you're in.

01:27:12.915 --> 01:27:15.873
- I'm not gonna be.
- You wanna wash it up?

01:27:16.075 --> 01:27:19.750
Fine! I'm too important
to monkey around with you.

01:27:19.955 --> 01:27:22.708
Jim! Jim, wake up!

01:27:25.395 --> 01:27:26.544
What is it?

01:27:26.795 --> 01:27:31.550
- Come on, you've got some work to do.
- All right. Be right with you.

01:27:31.795 --> 01:27:34.104
Okay. Well, get a move on!

01:27:35.955 --> 01:27:39.311
I'll fix it so you're out.
You're spoiled. I spoiled you.

01:27:39.515 --> 01:27:44.145
I was gonna make you be a real partner.
You don't want it? Fine!

01:27:44.395 --> 01:27:48.593
And you don't look like you used to.
I'll be glad to be rid of you.

01:27:48.795 --> 01:27:51.150
And as far as I'm concerned...

01:27:51.395 --> 01:27:54.512
Vice versa.

01:27:56.515 --> 01:27:58.153
You're back.

01:27:58.395 --> 01:27:59.748
- All set?
- Shut up!

01:27:59.955 --> 01:28:02.913
Settle things up
and get her out of here.

01:28:03.115 --> 01:28:05.549
- Are you sure?
- First time I am.

01:28:05.755 --> 01:28:08.792
- Where's that stuff?
- In your bedroom.

01:28:08.995 --> 01:28:11.350
- No!
- What do you mean, " no"?

01:28:11.595 --> 01:28:15.508
I mean, let's take the shortcut.
The sooner, the better.

01:28:22.315 --> 01:28:24.306
They're in the bottom drawer.

01:28:31.915 --> 01:28:34.907
- Blue covers?
- Yeah.

01:28:36.235 --> 01:28:39.113
- Three copies?
- That's right.

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.346
Paul took them.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.509
- When?
- Just now.

01:28:44.715 --> 01:28:45.704
What for?

01:28:46.115 --> 01:28:49.312
Why do you think?
To put in the newspapers.

01:28:49.515 --> 01:28:52.109
- Some jokes I don't like.
- It's no joke.

01:28:52.315 --> 01:28:54.590
Paul says it's
the biggest swindle...

01:28:54.835 --> 01:28:57.827
...since "the teapot."
Something like that.

01:28:58.995 --> 01:29:00.872
Why are you getting so white?

01:29:01.075 --> 01:29:04.147
You told me it was perfectly
all right.

01:29:04.355 --> 01:29:07.074
- You double-crossing...
- It's not like that.

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:11.632
If there's a fire and I call
the engines, who am I double-crossing?

01:29:11.835 --> 01:29:13.746
The fire?

01:29:17.795 --> 01:29:20.548
If this breaks,
nobody will play with us.

01:29:20.795 --> 01:29:24.310
- What's to do?
- Might be best to call it off.

01:29:24.515 --> 01:29:26.745
- What?
- Let him publish...

01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:30.192
I've spent a lot of dough.
Just let that ride?

01:29:30.435 --> 01:29:32.505
- Play it safe.
- I want my deal.

01:29:32.715 --> 01:29:36.071
- Gonna be tough to get.
- Because of some weasel?

01:29:36.275 --> 01:29:37.503
- Harry...
- You're chicken!

01:29:37.715 --> 01:29:38.750
- Think so?
- Yes.

01:29:38.955 --> 01:29:42.743
- I've been right and you've been wrong.
- Shut up!

01:29:42.955 --> 01:29:44.752
I'll handle this.

01:29:45.075 --> 01:29:46.747
All right.

01:29:52.395 --> 01:29:55.068
- Looking for someone?
- Billie.

01:29:55.475 --> 01:29:57.147
Come on in.

01:30:01.755 --> 01:30:05.145
- Billie!
- Gee, I'm tired. I was down...

01:30:05.675 --> 01:30:08.951
- I think you got something of mine.
- That so?

01:30:18.795 --> 01:30:20.547
How about it?

01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:27.353
Sit down.

01:30:33.235 --> 01:30:34.873
- Hello.
- How you been?

01:30:35.075 --> 01:30:36.349
- Fine, you?
- Fine.

01:30:36.715 --> 01:30:40.390
- Go to his place and get the stuff.
- It's not there.

01:30:40.595 --> 01:30:42.153
Where then?

01:30:43.595 --> 01:30:46.314
You wanna play rough?
I can do that too.

01:30:49.555 --> 01:30:52.865
I mean business.
I got too much at stake.

01:30:53.075 --> 01:30:56.147
You wanna get out alive,
you better give it back.

01:30:56.355 --> 01:30:59.711
- I'm no blowhard. Tell him.
- He's no blowhard.

01:30:59.915 --> 01:31:03.271
He's had people killed before.
About six years ago...

01:31:03.475 --> 01:31:06.308
You ain't gonna tell
nobody nothing soon.

01:31:06.835 --> 01:31:10.464
- Double negative! Right?
- Right.

01:31:12.235 --> 01:31:15.944
You're gonna be in trouble
unless you do what I say.

01:31:16.195 --> 01:31:19.346
Wait. There's another way
to handle this.

01:31:19.555 --> 01:31:22.865
You've pulled a boner, friend.
My advice is lay off.

01:31:23.075 --> 01:31:25.543
Stop sticking your noses
in my business.

01:31:25.755 --> 01:31:28.349
You're the biggest buttinsky
I ever met.

01:31:28.595 --> 01:31:32.907
That's my job. Your papers are
in the mail, addressed to myself.

01:31:33.115 --> 01:31:35.754
- Your job? Getting in my way?
- Not exactly.

01:31:35.995 --> 01:31:37.951
What, then? I'd like to know.

01:31:38.155 --> 01:31:41.511
To find out what goes on
and get it to the people.

01:31:41.715 --> 01:31:43.114
- What people?
- "The" people.

01:31:43.315 --> 01:31:45.624
- Never heard of them.
- You will.

01:31:45.835 --> 01:31:48.303
They're more well-known
all the time.

01:31:48.515 --> 01:31:53.543
- And if we're operating within the law?
- Then the law needs revision.

01:31:53.755 --> 01:31:55.666
- Are you the government?
- Yes.

01:31:55.915 --> 01:31:58.748
- Since when?
- Since 1779. Right?

01:31:58.995 --> 01:32:00.348
Right.

01:32:00.955 --> 01:32:03.105
What do you think you've got?

01:32:03.275 --> 01:32:06.347
Harry's connection
to Hedge's amendment.

01:32:06.555 --> 01:32:08.785
- Why single us out?
- Yeah, why?

01:32:08.995 --> 01:32:11.748
What we're doing is done every day.

01:32:11.955 --> 01:32:16.949
Murders could go undiscovered
every day. What does that prove?

01:32:17.195 --> 01:32:22.394
Undercover pressure, bribery,
corruption, government between friends!

01:32:22.595 --> 01:32:26.508
It's tough to crack.
Ask me, I've tried for years.

01:32:26.715 --> 01:32:30.344
You need more than knowing.
You gotta have facts.

01:32:30.595 --> 01:32:34.508
- And most important, the names.
- He's got them.

01:32:35.235 --> 01:32:39.353
All right. Let's get down to it.
What will you take, Paul?

01:32:39.595 --> 01:32:41.153
I'll take a drink.

01:32:41.395 --> 01:32:43.989
I ain't met a guy
didn't have his price.

01:32:44.195 --> 01:32:46.026
- I have.
- I mean big numbers!

01:32:46.355 --> 01:32:50.473
You'll be wearing
a big number across your chest!

01:32:50.675 --> 01:32:52.745
I'll get to you later.

01:32:52.955 --> 01:32:57.471
There's two ways to do this. One,
play ball. Two, watch your step...

01:32:57.675 --> 01:33:02.544
...because there's no place you can
live if you monkey-wrench me.

01:33:02.755 --> 01:33:04.552
What do you say?

01:33:06.795 --> 01:33:11.152
- I'd like to think it over.
- All right. You got two minutes.

01:33:34.155 --> 01:33:35.952
Come on, Billie.

01:33:37.595 --> 01:33:39.153
Wait a minute, Harry!

01:33:39.395 --> 01:33:40.748
Cut it out, Harry!

01:33:40.955 --> 01:33:44.152
- Operator!
- Behave yourself.

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:51.348
You stupid fool.
What do you think you are?

01:33:51.555 --> 01:33:55.309
This muscle stuff is a thing
of the past. Cut it out!

01:33:55.515 --> 01:33:56.914
I got mad.

01:33:57.475 --> 01:33:58.954
Who are you to get mad?

01:33:59.195 --> 01:34:02.744
- Be grateful you're free!
- You don't know me to talk like that!

01:34:02.955 --> 01:34:06.550
I know you. A kick in the keister
and your problems are solved.

01:34:06.795 --> 01:34:10.151
Bigger problems, bigger kicks.
Who's next? The nation?

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:14.308
Don't blow your top.
I'm still ready to do business.

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.949
How's 100 grand?

01:34:17.195 --> 01:34:20.153
A hundred grand is beautiful,
but I can't take it.

01:34:20.395 --> 01:34:21.714
Why not?

01:34:23.475 --> 01:34:26.945
- My girl wouldn't like it, would she?
- No, she wouldn't.

01:34:27.155 --> 01:34:28.793
Then what's your idea?

01:34:29.115 --> 01:34:33.984
No idea. Legislation's
not meant for buying and selling.

01:34:34.195 --> 01:34:37.153
"This country belongs
to the people who inhibit it"!

01:34:37.475 --> 01:34:38.749
- Inhabit.
- Inhabit it!

01:34:38.955 --> 01:34:40.752
- I'll do what I want.
- Try it.

01:34:40.995 --> 01:34:42.144
- Who'll stop me?
- Us two.

01:34:42.355 --> 01:34:44.152
Youse two? It'll be some day...

01:34:44.395 --> 01:34:48.104
...when a hundred-a-week hick
and a dumb broad can stop me.

01:34:49.195 --> 01:34:53.074
And you, standing around like
you're deaf! Say something!

01:34:53.275 --> 01:34:55.345
- All right, I'll say something.
- Well?

01:34:55.595 --> 01:34:56.744
They're right.

01:34:56.955 --> 01:35:00.470
Whose side are you on?
What do you want?

01:35:00.675 --> 01:35:02.347
- Rye ginger ale.
- Who asked you?

01:35:02.555 --> 01:35:05.353
Tell that congressman he's
all washed up. I guarantee.

01:35:05.555 --> 01:35:07.944
You won't
get away with it either.

01:35:08.155 --> 01:35:11.909
- Don't worry about me.
- But I do. I worry like the devil.

01:35:12.115 --> 01:35:16.313
When you live in Washington
it's enough to break your heart.

01:35:16.515 --> 01:35:19.712
You see a piece of machinery,
the democratic structure...

01:35:19.915 --> 01:35:22.873
...and somebody's always
tampering with it.

01:35:23.075 --> 01:35:26.909
Steal from the government and
you steal from yourself, you dumb ox!

01:35:27.115 --> 01:35:28.514
I'm going right ahead.

01:35:28.715 --> 01:35:31.149
- I'll tell you where you're going.
- You?

01:35:31.355 --> 01:35:35.951
In this whole thing, I guess you
forgot about how I'm a partner.

01:35:36.195 --> 01:35:39.949
Jim once told me.
126 different yards I own.

01:35:40.195 --> 01:35:41.310
Control.

01:35:41.595 --> 01:35:44.553
Same thing. Here's how it is.
I don't want them.

01:35:44.795 --> 01:35:47.753
I don't want what's yours,
so I'm signing them back.

01:35:47.995 --> 01:35:50.748
- All right.
- Only not all at once. One at a time.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:52.508
One a year.

01:35:53.595 --> 01:35:55.472
Only you gotta behave!

01:35:55.675 --> 01:35:58.314
If you don't,
I could let go on everything.

01:35:58.515 --> 01:36:01.154
For what you've done,
even since I've known you...

01:36:01.395 --> 01:36:05.104
...I bet you could be put in jail
for about 900 years.

01:36:05.515 --> 01:36:08.507
You'd be a pretty old man
when you got out.

01:36:09.675 --> 01:36:11.154
What's going on around here?

01:36:11.355 --> 01:36:12.470
A revolution.

01:36:12.675 --> 01:36:15.314
Come on, Paul.
I'll send for my things.

01:36:15.515 --> 01:36:19.110
You little crumb. You'll be
sorry for this. Wait and see.

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:21.112
Go ahead.
You don't stand a chance.

01:36:21.315 --> 01:36:23.271
You'll outsmart yourself.

01:36:23.475 --> 01:36:24.954
- Goodbye, all.
- And you!

01:36:25.195 --> 01:36:26.150
- Me?
- Yeah!

01:36:26.395 --> 01:36:30.104
- You're fired.
- Sorry. I enjoyed working for you.

01:36:31.875 --> 01:36:34.264
- Open up.
- All right, Harry?

01:36:34.475 --> 01:36:36.943
Do what I'm telling you!

01:36:48.675 --> 01:36:50.506
How do you like that?

01:36:51.075 --> 01:36:53.908
He could've had 100 grand.
She could've had me.

01:36:54.115 --> 01:36:55.946
Both wind up with nothing.

01:36:56.195 --> 01:36:58.106
Dumb chump!

01:36:58.315 --> 01:36:59.668
Crazy broad.

01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:03.072
To all the dumb chumps
and all the crazy broads...

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:05.152
...past, present and future...

01:37:05.355 --> 01:37:08.347
...who thirst for knowledge
and search for truth...

01:37:08.595 --> 01:37:12.668
...who fight for justice
and civilize each other...

01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:16.504
...and make it so tough
for crooks like you.

01:37:16.715 --> 01:37:18.114
And me.

01:37:27.315 --> 01:37:28.953
License, please.

01:37:33.115 --> 01:37:34.946
- No, not this license.
- Sorry.

01:37:35.195 --> 01:37:36.708
Forget it.
My wedding present.

01:37:36.915 --> 01:37:39.873
- Take it easy, or you'll never make it.
- We'll make it.

01:37:40.075 --> 01:37:42.748
It's a clear case
of predestination.

01:37:42.995 --> 01:37:44.064
" Pre" what?

01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:45.708
Look it up.

01:38:01.835 --> 01:38:02.824
