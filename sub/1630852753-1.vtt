WEBVTT

00:49.132 --> 00:51.802
She wants to see you. You wanna see her.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.304
Nothing can ruin this night.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.480
No!

01:06.984 --> 01:08.110
Xavier!

01:59.369 --> 02:00.370
Hey, Cap.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.165
Danner,
what are you doing at Xavier's place?

02:03.248 --> 02:04.875
Okay, you got me.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.044
I heard it on the scanner.
I picked up Culp.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.586
- Let me take the lead.
- Hey, Captain.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.631
You can't, okay?
You're not right for it, okay?

02:10.714 --> 02:14.009
- Come on, Greg. You know I can do this.
- Look at this place.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.845
I can't risk it, Danner.
It's too high-profile.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.223
Chief already called in a ringer from LA.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.350
- A ringer? Who?
- A ringer?

02:21.433 --> 02:24.061
Detective Germain.
He caught the Tar Pits Strangler.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.230
Oh, I know who he is. He's garbage, man.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.982
Well, it doesn't matter. He'll be
on the first flight in the morning.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.108
He's taking lead detective.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.985
What if I solve the case
before he gets here?

02:32.069 --> 02:35.030
Look. The victim was having an after-party
for his high school reunion.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.698
The guests are still in the house.

02:36.782 --> 02:40.577
You could collect simple statements,
nothing more. This is not your case.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.579
- Do you understand?
- Copy.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.916
What did he say?

02:45.999 --> 02:49.545
All right, everyone.
I'm lead on this case.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.088
Lead on the case!

02:51.171 --> 02:55.384
Captain wants answers
by the morning for this celebrity death.

02:55.467 --> 03:00.222
She is in charge, as am I.
Again, we are both in charge.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.975
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.102
It is really him. It's Xavier.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.397
I need to take a moment.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.608
Okay, so the victim seems to have fallen
from his house.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.277
It could be an accident or suicide.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.363
No shirt? Mmm. His jacket's wet.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.449
- You gonna sniff him like that?
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.702
Yep. Whiskey and ginger ale.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.036
Oh, my God.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.624
There's shrimp everywhere.
Cooked shrimp, so not from the ocean.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.294
There's a blond wig over there.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.921
Was someone playing
"dress up and kill the rock star"?

03:33.005 --> 03:35.174
There's something underneath him. Hmm.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.386
Okay. We got a hat.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.724
Can I get one of those yellow things
with the numbers on 'em? Thank you.

03:43.807 --> 03:48.145
Now how can it be a suicide
if he's laying on top of the hat, huh?

03:48.228 --> 03:53.066
The hat would fall off of his head
and float down. The hat came down first.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.319
Okay, maybe not a suicide.
What if it's an accident?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.571
What if he's looking out at the view
over the balcony?

03:57.654 --> 04:00.282
Plate of shrimp cocktail. He looks down.
"I'm not wearing a shirt."

04:00.365 --> 04:02.951
It's literally the first time that night
he's realizing it.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.746
The shock from that jostles the hat.
It falls off the balcony.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.582
- He g-goes to get it.
- I don't think so.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.127
- 'Cause he has a contusion on his nose.
- Someone punched him in the nose.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.214
This is a murder.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.888
How did this all go so wrong?

04:23.972 --> 04:24.973
I didn't do it.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.184
It's okay, man. Nobody thinks you did.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.730
It's just--

04:36.109 --> 04:38.779
I just-- I can't.

04:38.862 --> 04:42.324
I can't. I just-- You-- I just--

04:42.407 --> 04:46.328
Yes. Yeah.
I guessed the, uh, Wi-Fi password.

04:46.411 --> 04:50.791
If anybody needs it,
it's, um, "xavier," all lowercase.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.919
Uh, "xavier." No?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.880
More bandwidth for me.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.508
Hello, everyone. I'm Detec--

04:59.591 --> 05:01.510
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa. Shit.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.638
Just slipped on a puddle right there.
That's weird.

05:05.222 --> 05:09.309
I'm, uh, Detective Danner. And this--

05:10.561 --> 05:12.938
The hell is a arrow in the--

05:14.815 --> 05:16.483
God, a shrub X?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.528
The hell is goin' on up--

05:19.611 --> 05:21.822
Culp. Uh, I'm Detective Culp.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.868
Mmm. You rich people love to ski.
Don't even need snow.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.454
Y'all some messy white folks,
I'll tell you that much. Oh, hey.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.957
Uh, we will be
collecting statements shortly.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.334
So, get comfortable, folks.
But not too comfortable.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.378
Like wool pajamas.

05:36.461 --> 05:41.341
Yes. And no social medias, please.
We don't wanna turn this into a circus.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.426
Even though it looks like

05:42.509 --> 05:44.511
Barnum and Bailey's
done came through this bitch.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.598
- Xavier's on TV. Dude, turn it up.
- …sources on social media

05:47.681 --> 05:49.308
confirm pop star, actor

05:49.391 --> 05:51.935
- and celebrity humanitarian, Xavier…
- Fuck.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.187
…was found dead tonight,

05:53.270 --> 05:57.149
his body discovered on the cliff
below his second home in Belvedere

05:57.232 --> 06:00.194
during an after-party
for his high school reunion.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.905
We get more now from Linda Dela Rosa.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.116
Linda, can you give us the juicy details?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.619
I'm here outside Xavier's
Marin County compound

06:08.702 --> 06:10.621
where there is no word yet from police

06:10.704 --> 06:14.166
on whether foul play was a factor
in this unthinkable tragedy.

06:14.249 --> 06:18.504
Xavier was born Bay Area resident
Eugene Xavier Duckworth Jr.,

06:18.587 --> 06:21.590
the son of the owner of
coffee chain Gene's Beans.

06:21.673 --> 06:26.011
At the age of 21, Xavier went platinum
with the song "X Marks the G-Spot"

06:26.094 --> 06:28.555
- off his album Somebody Xave Me.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.392
From there, he turned to acting,

06:32.476 --> 06:35.562
starring in jungle adventure
Hungry Hungry Hippos,

06:35.646 --> 06:38.065
and securing a
People's Choice Award nomination

06:38.148 --> 06:41.527
for his portrayal of Daryl Hall
alongside Channing Tatum's Oates

06:41.610 --> 06:44.154
in the musical biopic Private Eyes.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.242
You see that?
That right there is what we need.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.410
- A broken record?
- No, a smash hit!

06:50.494 --> 06:55.415
This city will put you in its mouth,
bite you up and spit you out.

06:55.499 --> 06:56.917
It's a-- It's an eater of men.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.254
Wait.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.006
What did you just say?

07:03.090 --> 07:06.093
- Grab your ax. It's chart-breaking time.
- Let's break them charts.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.177
Come on. Let's eat.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.471
- Okay. You go high. I'll go the same high.
- Okay.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.722
And a one, and a--

07:10.806 --> 07:12.766
- Turn that mess off.
- Yeah. Of course.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.435
Now, everybody, uh, stay tuned.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.230
You are wet.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.942
Soaking wet.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.362
We'll be right back. Y'all stay put.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.417
Brett.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.420
How many times tonight
have I told you I don't wanna talk to you?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.714
- Three times.
- So why are you talking to me?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.883
Because I know what you're hiding
in your car.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.639
And I know what you said to me
in the hallway at the reunion.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.266
- So…
- So nobody needs to say anything.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.475
About anything.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.187
- Good.
- Good talk.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.605
That's all there needed to be said.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.316
- Then why are we still talking?
- We're not.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.817
You are. You just said that.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.528
Just 'cause it seems like you need
the last word and it annoys me.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.530
- Well, now I'm ending it.
- Good.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.782
There are some scrapes here
on the railing.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.493
- Could be the signs of a scuffle.
- Shh! Can't hear.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.037
- Done.
- Now it is, yes.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.538
One, two, three…

08:16.622 --> 08:19.291
- Didn't agree to a one, two, three.
- …over. Ah, my God!

08:19.374 --> 08:20.375
Great.

08:20.459 --> 08:24.213
So, we got Mr. Aggro and the train wreck.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.089
Get the cornstarch.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.841
- The plot thickens.
- Mmm.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.302
There's a drop of blood here
on the balcony floor,

08:30.385 --> 08:33.263
which is probably from Xavier
getting punched in the nose.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.557
And there are no security cameras
in sight.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.768
And beep boop boop beep ba bap beep boop--

08:37.851 --> 08:40.020
I could be saying anything
because you're not listening.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.355
Oh, my God.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.149
Don't you care about the--

08:44.232 --> 08:45.776
Blood on the floor? Sure.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.654
But I care more about

08:48.737 --> 08:53.242
adorkable lover boy
eyeing uptight artist girl.

08:53.325 --> 08:57.246
Okay. He obviously is adorkable,
but how do you know she's an artist?

08:57.329 --> 08:58.455
Ink on her hands.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.000
Pay attention, Culp.
We're solving a murder.

09:02.501 --> 09:06.880
Okay. There's too many of you
to take down to the station.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.424
So, I'll be interviewing you all here.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.095
And I wanna talk to
every single one of you.

09:13.929 --> 09:18.392
Because the truth is,
any one of you could be the murderer.

09:18.475 --> 09:22.104
Now, you all went to
your high school reunion this evening.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.398
For what, second chances?

09:25.607 --> 09:26.608
At life?

09:27.651 --> 09:28.652
Love?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.238
Something else?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.491
Emotions are high.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.953
Someone pushes your buttons,
and all of a sudden,

09:38.036 --> 09:40.122
snap, bam!

09:40.205 --> 09:42.124
You lose it!

09:42.207 --> 09:43.625
So it'll take a few hours.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.085
- Are you serious?
- Hours? Why?

09:45.169 --> 09:47.421
What else you got to do
in the middle of the damn night?

09:47.504 --> 09:49.590
Why? We all know that Aniq killed him.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.884
Oh, my God. No, I didn't!

09:51.967 --> 09:54.428
- I'm guessing you're Aniq?
- She's good.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.806
Did you actually see him kill Xavier?

09:59.141 --> 10:01.685
- No, but I did--
- Sit your ass down.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.314
You should be ashamed of yourself
wearing heels that pregnant.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.107
It's not good for your back.

10:07.191 --> 10:13.030
Look. So, did anyone here
actually witness Xavier's murder?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.282
- No, ma'am-- Officer.
- No.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.326
- No.
- The murderer did.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.913
Everyone else doesn't know what happened,

10:20.996 --> 10:26.126
because we're all stars of our own movie.

10:26.210 --> 10:30.214
The same thing could happen,
but you see it in a different way.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.675
And as a part of my process,
I like to talk to each person.

10:33.759 --> 10:37.513
I wanna hear your story.
I wanna hear your mind movie.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.932
- Mind movie?
- You gather all that together,

10:40.015 --> 10:42.351
- then you can get at the truth.
- Agreed.

10:42.434 --> 10:46.813
And the truth is that Indigo saw Aniq
at the scene of the crime.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.148
Indigo, tell her.

10:48.232 --> 10:51.777
Darling, avec plaisir.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.784
I was on the lower balcony
with the Jennifers

10:58.867 --> 11:02.829
while Ned was performing
a ski-based art project

11:02.913 --> 11:04.289
on a passed-out Aniq.

11:04.373 --> 11:08.794
Oh, Ned. Come onto the terrace with me
and stop taunting Aniq with your pranks.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.128
This is more than a prank.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.341
This is a metaphor
for society's illusion of stability.

11:14.842 --> 11:19.388
What? Whoa. Okay, dude, I…
…do not know what that means.

11:19.471 --> 11:23.392
I was over there doing the perfect prank:
when you spill beer on a guy.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.601
Funny as hell.

11:24.685 --> 11:29.523
Meanwhile, strangely from above,
Xavier urinated off the balcony

11:29.606 --> 11:31.650
- right onto Jenn number one.
- Oh, what is that?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.236
I believe
Xavier is urinating on your head.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.571
Oh, God!

11:35.654 --> 11:37.948
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Ned!

11:38.031 --> 11:40.534
She called her husband
to help her wash it off--

11:40.617 --> 11:43.579
But the bathroom was occupied
with someone dropping a deuce, Officer.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.581
- And then

11:45.664 --> 11:49.710
light, sound, chaos.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.755
- Television.
- Oh, and what was on TV?

11:53.839 --> 11:55.924
I try to avoid looking at screens.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.801
How great is this party?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.803
Whatever it was, it woke up Aniq.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.139
Who did this?

12:03.515 --> 12:06.768
Xavier. Xavier did this.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.729
Where is he? He did this.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.063
Is he still up there?

12:10.147 --> 12:13.650
Aniq. Calm down, my friend.
This wasn't Xavier's fault.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.652
Find your center.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.613
No, friend.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.158
The center won't hold. This ends now.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.163
He went upstairs very angry.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.789
And then…

12:27.873 --> 12:30.417
Oh! Oh, no!

12:30.501 --> 12:33.003
What on earth made that terrible sound?

12:34.046 --> 12:37.925
And that is when they saw the body.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.390
- I think he's dead. Oh!

12:45.474 --> 12:48.393
- Are you okay?
- Xavier!

12:56.235 --> 12:57.528
Oh, no.

13:00.197 --> 13:03.242
Okay. So, we've heard one story.

13:03.325 --> 13:07.496
I don't know what kind of weird art house
movie's going on in your mind,

13:07.579 --> 13:10.958
but it leads to one guy.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.628
All right, Mr. Scribble Face.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.464
Let's find somewhere private. You're up.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.093
- Culp, stay, please.
- I know.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.805
Look who's in charge now.
And I'm not scared.

13:29.059 --> 13:33.272
So, I know things are looking bad for you,
but I would just try to stay calm.

13:33.355 --> 13:38.026
Now, do I have a list of
the remaining houseguests here? Let--

13:38.110 --> 13:42.239
Clockwise in the room as you saw them
were Indigo, Jenn 1, Ned, Zoë, Brett,

13:42.322 --> 13:46.410
Yasper, me, Chelsea,
and I think his name is Walt.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.078
You one of those smarties, huh?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.747
I mean, yeah. I guess so.
What is all this stuff?

13:50.831 --> 13:52.708
I figured you'd probably be
a little nervous.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.669
And this keeps you relaxed.
Makes it kinda fun.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.797
I'm not having fun,
in case that was your goal.

13:58.881 --> 14:02.259
Well, my goal is to find out
who killed Xavier.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.262
But it'd be nice to have some fun
in the process.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.222
Someone died. I could be arrested.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.807
Only if you did it.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.394
But, look, I want to hear
your side of the story.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.771
You wanna hear my mind movie, yeah?

14:14.855 --> 14:17.733
Exactly. That's right.
Now, come on. Bring it.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.902
Hit me with it from the top, okay?

14:19.985 --> 14:23.697
I wanna hear everything that happened.
Now, all the details of the whole night.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.242
Okay? Now tell me, why'd you come tonight?

14:27.326 --> 14:28.994
Uh, it's embarrassing.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.537
Come on.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.207
Fine.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.337
I came… …for love.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.380
Who you love? Tell me.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.466
Yeah, I came for Zoë.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.761
We were chemistry partners
back in high school.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.305
We didn't just have chemistry together.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.225
We had chemistry together.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.560
But wasn't meant to be.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.271
Then I found out about her divorce.

14:56.355 --> 15:00.025
And a week ago, she sent me an email
asking me to come.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.568
And it had a…

15:02.361 --> 15:05.906
Smiley face emoji. What does that mean?

15:05.989 --> 15:08.659
Oh, Aniq. What's going on, man?

15:08.742 --> 15:10.285
It's been, like, two years.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.703
Yasper.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.788
Oh!

15:13.288 --> 15:15.832
- Whoa! Good to see you.
- Good to see you, man.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.252
I'm so happy you came.
Let me see this new jacket.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.254
- Oh, this thing?
- I know you just got-- Yeah. Oof!

15:20.337 --> 15:22.965
You look incredi-- Ah! Distinguished.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.425
- Thank you. You look great. Look at you.
- Well, I don't know.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.593
I've been working out a lot.

15:26.677 --> 15:27.970
- Have you heard of Pilates?
- I have.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.596
I haven't done 'em yet,
but I've heard of 'em.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.640
You know what could up your game?
Take my tie.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.393
It's basically like an arrow
pointing to your dong.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.229
Oh. Well, Yasper,
then what would point to your dong?

15:37.312 --> 15:38.814
You just saved my life. You're right.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.650
Have you gotten my texts
about Zoë being single?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.777
Yes. And thank you for those.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.737
Oh, look at Chelsea.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.573
- What happened to her?
- Hey, Chelsea.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.616
- Oh. Hey.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.702
Uh, were you guys following me?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.245
- No. We're not following you.
- No.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.832
I mean, um, hey, Yasper and Aniq.

15:56.915 --> 16:00.794
She had a total breakdown.
Went absolutely insane.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.629
Oh. Class prez to hot mezz.

16:02.713 --> 16:07.050
Yes. Oh, but you know who's not a mess?
Excuse me, sir. May I have one of these?

16:07.134 --> 16:09.511
Oh, I'm sorry. What's this?
Why is your hand like this?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.597
Think I was hiding an Oreo cookie
in my hand.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.933
See, that's why it's a great picture.
Because you have a secret.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.810
And look at th-- Oh, my God.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.605
This guy is right next to--
Are you serious?

16:20.314 --> 16:21.565
It's kismet.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.318
These guys together. That's why
they put you next to each other.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.195
I just don't wanna get my hopes up,
you know?

16:26.278 --> 16:28.572
It feels like every time we got close
in high school,

16:28.655 --> 16:31.658
some rich, handsome guy would just
come swooping in and get between us.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.995
Stop. You're not in high school anymore.
Now you're the rich, handsome guy.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.788
Oh, thank you. I'm certainly not rich.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.165
- But I have been working out.
- Zoë.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.417
Not for Zoë, for my own
personal enrichment actually.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.336
- No, Zoë. Zoë, Zoë.
- I did CrossFit, but--

16:42.419 --> 16:44.004
- Zoë, Zoë. Get a--
- Oh, hey, Zoë.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.174
- Hey. Oh, no.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.592
Oh, my God.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.773
- Oh, hi.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.943
- Hey. Here. I got you this.
- Okay.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.944
- That's so thoughtful. Thank you.
- Oh, of course.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.446
- Yeah.
- Oh. Oh, whoa!

17:12.324 --> 17:14.326
- Okay.
- Fair.

17:14.409 --> 17:18.163
That's good. I don't know my own strength
'cause I've been working out so much.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.623
- Oh.
- Don't know if you've seen that?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.959
How strong do you have to be
to pop a balloon?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.961
Still a smart-ass, I see.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.880
- Um…
- It's, uh, really good to see you, Zoë.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.257
Yeah, you too, Aniq.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.383
Yeah.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.343
So, I will see you inside?

17:31.426 --> 17:34.054
I'll probably see you in there.
I gotta punch the rest of these balloons.

17:34.137 --> 17:37.140
- I'll probably be in there after that.
- You be careful out here.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.354
My God. Oh, my God.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.940
It is a miracle that these balloons
didn't go up in flames

17:45.023 --> 17:48.485
because you two had some serious sparks.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.821
- You tell me you didn't feel that.
- I don't know, maybe.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.531
Maybe? No.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.826
Maybe it was amazing!
Did you see that? Oh, my goodness!

17:55.909 --> 17:58.161
It's, like, just, ah!
It was incre-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.248
- Are you sure you wanna know all this?
- I am here for it.

18:01.331 --> 18:05.419
You had a meet cute.
You got the crazy, wild, obnoxious friend.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.504
Well… …I guess so.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.756
I haven't felt these kind of rom-com vibes

18:09.840 --> 18:14.344
since Hugh Grant met Julia Roberts
in his little bookstore.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.889
- Yeah, right.
- Come on. Tell me what happened next.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.558
Do not leave out any details.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.810
Matter of fact, I need my popcorn.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.521
You actually have popcorn.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.898
Uh, yeah.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.400
- Can I get one piece?
- Yeah.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.737
It's good, right? It's low-fat.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.906
- You feel good, right?
- I'm excited. I do.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.240
- That's because love.
- Yeah.

18:35.324 --> 18:37.618
Hey, Aniq.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.328
- Hey, man.
- Do you remember me?

18:39.411 --> 18:42.122
Oh, yeah. Of course. Long time.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.999
Yeah. So, what's my name?

18:44.082 --> 18:47.461
Whoa. Coming in real hot. Uh…

18:47.544 --> 18:50.464
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:50.547 --> 18:52.466
Um, um, Slam? Slamps? Slamps?

18:52.549 --> 18:54.510
- Slamps?
- No. Uh, it's Walt.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.553
- Sure?
- Yeah.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.264
Oh, yeah. That's right. Uh-- Walt. Yes.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.350
- Yeah, cool.
- Well, this is fun.

19:01.433 --> 19:04.353
Oh. So good to have fun with you again.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.940
Did you actually go to this school,
or what's the whole thing?

19:08.023 --> 19:11.735
Yeah. We were all in
the same chemistry class with Mr. Shapiro.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.280
I got a bunch of yeast in my ear
that time and you all--

19:15.364 --> 19:19.993
You didn't say anything about it, or no--

19:20.077 --> 19:22.579
I can't believe this. I--

19:24.414 --> 19:26.959
No one ever paid attention to me
in high school.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.878
Tonight will be different.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.589
I'll make sure they don't forget.

19:33.757 --> 19:34.967
Not this time.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.511
Well, it's gonna be hard
to get any attention tonight.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.054
Not with Xavier coming.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.807
- Oh, my God. I can't believe he's coming.
- I actually gave him his start.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.725
We were actually in a band
together in high school.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.477
- Oh, yeah. Ska-pe Diem.
- Ska-pe Diem.

19:45.561 --> 19:48.647
You remember Ska-pe Diem? Right?
We shredded the MLK Day barbecue.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.107
This one.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.614
I'm still making songs today.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.658
And I'm trying to get Xavier
to bless my track.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.326
Bless your track? Is he a priest?

20:01.410 --> 20:02.744
Oh!

20:02.828 --> 20:05.497
Sorry. That's so funny.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.583
- Just like at school.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.380
Oh, my God. He's here. We-- Are we good?

20:16.008 --> 20:18.594
- Dude knows how to make an entrance.
- Xavier's here!

20:20.804 --> 20:23.849
Look. Zoë too?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.809
I talk to Zoë for the first time in years,

20:25.893 --> 20:28.812
and a rich, good-looking guy
literally swoops in out of the sky.

20:28.896 --> 20:31.440
- Come on. Stop.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.693
Come on.
It's not about me tonight, all right?

20:34.776 --> 20:37.821
I'm just here to reune
like all you normal people.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.740
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Xavier.
- All right.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.325
Let me get a selfie. Yo, yo.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.661
- Aight. Do the angle even higher,

20:44.745 --> 20:45.746
it's sexy, all right?

20:45.829 --> 20:48.665
You're an amazing dude.
Tonight is your night.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.793
- You got this.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.003
Yeah, all right.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.671
- You're right.
- Whoops.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.548
- I'm not gonna do that again.
- Good.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.468
The Jennifers.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.844
- Oh!
- Hey.

21:00.928 --> 21:04.181
- Hi. Oh, my gosh. You guys.
- Gosh, you guys are here.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.183
- Aniq. Yasper.
- I know you, you idiot.

21:06.266 --> 21:10.103
Um, so, listen.
Grab your name tags and hand them to me.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.398
I'm gonna write down everyone's jobs
for networking purposes.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.691
My husband Ned's idea.

21:14.775 --> 21:15.901
- You remember Ned?
- Mm-hmm.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.945
I wish you guys could
meet my husband, Joshie.

21:18.028 --> 21:21.198
But he's in Tokyo.
He's doing a deal with PoochKicks.net.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.242
It's an NBA-grade sneaker for dogs.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.369
So, uh, what is it that you two do?

21:25.452 --> 21:28.705
I'm actually the owner of my very own
audiovisual installation company,

21:28.789 --> 21:31.375
but my true love, it's music.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.586
And that means you will probably enjoy
karaoke hour inside.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.005
- I will. You're right.
- Good. Good, good.

21:37.089 --> 21:38.090
Do you work?

21:38.173 --> 21:41.134
Oh. Yeah, yes. Uh, I design escape rooms.

21:41.218 --> 21:42.386
Like the fire department?

21:42.469 --> 21:45.347
Ye-- It's-- It's, like, a-- a room.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.892
It's, like, a phenomenon.
It's-- It's, like, a room you go into.

21:48.976 --> 21:51.353
Uh, and then the idea
is to get out of the room.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.021
- Then you solve clues--
- That's any room.

21:53.105 --> 21:55.774
Well, yes. Exactly. But this one,
the room itself, it's a puzzle.

21:55.858 --> 21:58.569
The current one is Christmas-themed.
It's called Santa Claustrophobia.

21:58.652 --> 22:01.321
- I love Santa, but I'm Jewish.

22:01.405 --> 22:03.866
Well, no. You just wrote Santa Claus.
I'm-- Can I see that?

22:03.949 --> 22:06.785
You made that holiday-themed
escape room in the Mission?

22:06.869 --> 22:09.997
Yeah. You-- You know it, huh?
Yeah. Actually I designed it.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.874
I was so stuck in there.

22:11.957 --> 22:15.711
I kept on calling that attendant like,
"Hello. I need a clue.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.881
Hello? Hello?
Do you got another clue for me?"

22:18.964 --> 22:20.507
I needed all the clues.

22:20.591 --> 22:22.009
Oh, okay.

22:22.092 --> 22:26.388
As a detective, you weren't able
to just, like, take the clues

22:26.471 --> 22:31.643
and-- and apply that to the--
the puzzle itself and then solve the pu--

22:31.727 --> 22:32.769
Not how my brain works.

22:32.853 --> 22:35.814
I'm more of a social dynamics
type of person.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.107
Anyway, go on.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.235
Oh, boy.

22:40.319 --> 22:41.612
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.238
- Do you feel good?
- I do. Really good.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.365
I'm gonna stick by you.
I know how you're nervous.

22:45.449 --> 22:48.577
Are you serious, Janet? You're here?

23:28.700 --> 23:30.953
I mean, turning back time?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.790
I mean, she's gotta be
telling me something, right?

23:34.873 --> 23:37.793
- Are you talking to me?

23:37.876 --> 23:39.002
Oh, angel.

23:39.628 --> 23:43.298
We're all just withering sacks of flesh.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.634
I actually wasn't talking--
How are you? I hope good.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.470
Holy moly, ravioli. Are you seeing this?

23:48.554 --> 23:50.973
Do you see what's happening right now?
She's singing to you.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.683
- You should sing a song back to her.
- Ooh!

23:52.766 --> 23:53.851
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:53.934 --> 23:57.271
Uh, this song is dedicated to
my former chemistry partner.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.606
Here's to reconnecting old covalent bonds.

24:02.985 --> 24:04.987
I'm sorry. This is the wrong song. Sir--

24:05.070 --> 24:06.613
Ooh! That's a great song!

24:10.367 --> 24:11.618
Oh.

24:11.702 --> 24:14.454
This is-- This is the wrong song.

24:14.538 --> 24:15.998
- You should--

24:19.918 --> 24:21.044
- Oh, no.

24:21.128 --> 24:24.047
This is the wrong-- I know you can hear me
'cause I'm on a microphone.

24:24.131 --> 24:26.592
- You're nailing it!

24:26.675 --> 24:28.886
Remember him?

24:33.098 --> 24:35.642
Can you turn the song off?
At this point, it's just cruel.

24:35.726 --> 24:37.519
- Eh-- Oh.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.189
Thank you.

24:40.272 --> 24:43.150
- That's so embarrassing. I mean--
- It really was.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.276
Oh, my God.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.195
That was supposed to be "Angel" by Shaggy.

24:46.278 --> 24:48.322
Oh. I love that song.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.908
Ah. You two look like you're having fun.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.911
- Hey.
- Hey, Xavier. How you doing?

24:53.994 --> 24:56.663
What's up, man?
Zoë, I noticed no one got you a drink yet.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.541
So, I got you a Kir Royale.
Match your dress.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.836
- That is so thoughtful. Thank you.
- That's very sweet.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.087
Um…

25:04.171 --> 25:09.593
Wow. Look at you, Xavier. Xa--
"Ex-avier"? What-- How do you--

25:09.676 --> 25:11.261
- Whichever way you like.
- Okay.

25:11.345 --> 25:12.596
- Yeah.
- Cool.

25:12.679 --> 25:15.599
- You're really famous.
- Yeah, I don't know.

25:15.682 --> 25:20.687
I'm kind of getting swarmed or whatever.
Everybody wants a piece of X-tasy.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.981
- Did you get it?
- Oh. Yeah, no. I did. I got it.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.984
Listen, I'm trying to curate the people
at my table for dinner.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.529
You know, make sure everyone's cool,
keep out the riffraff.

25:28.612 --> 25:30.572
- Saved you a seat.
- Oh, cool.

25:30.656 --> 25:33.659
Thank you. Um, is there room for Aniq?

25:35.786 --> 25:37.788
There's only one seat left.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.623
- Well, I-- I'm cool with squeezing.
- Oh.

25:39.706 --> 25:43.961
No. It's all good. You go ahead.
Uh, maybe we'll catch up later. Yeah?

25:44.044 --> 25:45.963
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Go ahead. Yeah, all good.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.423
- Bye, Aniq.
- All right, catch you.

25:49.383 --> 25:52.678
- Well, yeah. That's what I said.
- It's my fault. I let it happen.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.973
Stop. What are you doing?
You're a pleasant, wonderful man.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.100
There is nothing Xavier has
that you don't.

25:58.183 --> 25:59.476
Uh, a Grammy?

25:59.560 --> 26:00.602
- Yeah.
- People's Choice Award.

26:00.686 --> 26:01.687
Mm-hmm, he's got that.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.480
MTV Movie Award for best comedy sex scene.

26:03.564 --> 26:04.606
That was so funny.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.734
You're like, "How is he gonna--
Oh, that's how?"

26:07.818 --> 26:10.654
- Yeah, the upside-down part was just fun.
- Oh. Okay, he's cool.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.448
And he's got a lot of things.
How about this:

26:13.532 --> 26:17.744
Zoë's last husband was Brett.
You are definitely better than Brett.

26:17.828 --> 26:19.872
That's true. Brett's the answer
to the question of,

26:19.955 --> 26:21.957
"What if a human butt
could wear a jacket?"

26:22.040 --> 26:23.458
- Like the--
- What's up?

26:24.585 --> 26:26.545
- Hey, Brett.
- What a cool dude you are.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.715
Oh, my God. I really don't like Xavier.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.800
We were actually saying
something very similar.

26:31.884 --> 26:37.347
I hate him. I hate his little
purple-suit-wearing, Bieber-hair ass.

26:37.431 --> 26:38.682
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.310
I mean, why wear a suit
if you're not gonna wear a shirt?

26:41.393 --> 26:42.394
You wanna show off, what,

26:42.477 --> 26:44.938
you don't have hair on your body,
and you got muscles? Wow.

26:45.022 --> 26:47.024
- Right. It's--
- You know, in some countries,

26:47.107 --> 26:49.776
if the man doesn't have hair
when he turns 18, they kill you.

26:49.860 --> 26:51.778
- I don't know where that would be.
- They kill you.

26:51.862 --> 26:54.448
- What country is this?
- It happens. You ever been to Hungary?

26:54.531 --> 26:56.283
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes, I have, actually.

26:56.366 --> 26:57.910
Do you know what town it is?

26:57.993 --> 27:02.456
If Xavier touches Zoë,
I'm gonna flipping lose it.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.958
Yeah, maybe don't gesture
with the knife so much.

27:05.042 --> 27:08.170
If anyone touches her, I'm gonna kill him!

27:16.178 --> 27:21.016
So, what you are telling me is
Brett is Zoë's ex,

27:21.099 --> 27:23.352
and he threatened to kill Xavier?

27:23.435 --> 27:25.687
Brett said he'd kill anyone
who touched Zoë.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.731
So at the time,
I was more worried about myself.

27:29.525 --> 27:31.026
Two hands?

27:31.109 --> 27:33.612
- I don't wanna-- Let's forget about it.
- Don't look at the knife.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.030
You know what time it is?

27:35.113 --> 27:37.282
- It's like--
- It's Yasper time!

27:37.366 --> 27:38.867
Do you know what that means?

27:38.951 --> 27:41.453
I'm gonna distract Xavier
in a very subtle way.

27:41.537 --> 27:44.248
You will not even hear me.
I'm gonna be like that little Twitter bug.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.208
Know what I mean?
It's a bug. Twitter uses a bug?

27:46.291 --> 27:48.877
- It's a bird. The whole point is--
- Whilst I do that,

27:48.961 --> 27:51.129
you can go sneak off with Zoë.
It's a perfect plan.

27:51.213 --> 27:53.674
Because I have music business
to talk about with Xavier anyway.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.009
- Yeah, what about Brett?
- Don't worry about Brett.

27:56.093 --> 28:00.055
Hiedy-hosh. Xavier? Is that you?

28:00.138 --> 28:02.474
Oh, I'm blinded by the talent
for a second.

28:02.558 --> 28:04.893
- What's going on, man?
- Yasper, what's up?

28:04.977 --> 28:07.312
How you liking that AV equipment
I installed in your place, huh?

28:07.396 --> 28:10.524
Because I was so flattered
you called an old friend to do the job.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.861
Oh… …yeah, no.
My assistant chose the company we hired.

28:13.944 --> 28:16.697
But that's cool man, you know?
Glad to help the cause.

28:16.780 --> 28:20.325
Help the cause. But now it's like, "What?"
when you go in there. It's insane, right?

28:20.909 --> 28:22.202
The remote.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.413
Doesn't really work. It's kind of weird.

28:24.496 --> 28:26.206
- I can explain it. Come over here.
- Yeah?

28:26.290 --> 28:27.499
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.626
- Um, be right b?
- Sure.

28:29.710 --> 28:30.961
Okay.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.337
Mmm.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.175
Uh, madam, might I interest you
in some bread this evening?

28:36.258 --> 28:38.552
Mmm. Thank you, good sir. Yes.

28:38.635 --> 28:40.762
I'm actually on an all-bread diet
right now.

28:40.846 --> 28:42.514
So I'm gonna take the whole basket.

28:42.598 --> 28:44.641
So wait, is it sort of like
a reverse keto?

28:44.725 --> 28:47.895
Yeah, it's very bloating. Yeah.
But that's what I'm going for right now.

28:47.978 --> 28:51.607
- I like a nice bloat.
- Ah. A bloat honestly suits you.

28:52.816 --> 28:55.277
That's not--

28:55.360 --> 28:58.697
If you wanted to be, it wouldn't matter.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.661
Isn't it so crazy to be here again
after all these years?

29:04.745 --> 29:08.832
You know what? It's not for me,
because I'm here every day.

29:09.458 --> 29:12.002
- Oh, wow! You're vice-principal?
- Yep.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.880
I'm so sorry. I didn't even see that.
I didn't look at your name tag.

29:14.963 --> 29:17.799
'Cause, you know,
I was just looking at you from the chin up

29:17.883 --> 29:19.051
'cause I'm so respectful.

29:19.134 --> 29:21.011
- Such a gentleman.
- Oh, well, you know.

29:21.094 --> 29:24.348
Oh. The lights are dimming.
They're doing a thing.

29:24.431 --> 29:25.432
- Oh.

29:25.516 --> 29:27.226
- Oh.
- Cute.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.228
- Whoa.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.485
Why are they all of Brett and me?

29:41.698 --> 29:46.703
Hey, do they still serve those delicious
chocolate cookies in the cafeteria?

29:46.787 --> 29:48.163
Best part of my job.

29:48.247 --> 29:50.666
- Do you think maybe as vice-principal--
- I'm gonna get my keys.

29:52.376 --> 29:54.378
- Right, um…
- So what do you say?

29:55.420 --> 29:56.797
Yeah, sure, whatever.

29:57.923 --> 30:03.136
I hope you enjoy this vintage wine.
It's a château whatever I could grab.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.264
- Uh, this bottle right here.

30:05.347 --> 30:07.057
- Yum.
- Oh, yes.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.809
Oh, this is a really cool mural.

30:08.892 --> 30:11.979
Would you believe me
if I told you I painted it?

30:12.062 --> 30:15.732
- Wow! What?
- Yeah. About two years ago.

30:15.816 --> 30:18.777
- I used to be the art teacher.
- Aw, I love it.

30:18.861 --> 30:23.407
It's very Shepard Fairey meets,
uh, a different artist's name.

30:23.490 --> 30:26.034
- Do you know any other artists?
- I know two.

30:26.118 --> 30:27.995
I know Shepard Fairey and you.

30:28.078 --> 30:29.454
- Yeah.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.124
Hey.

30:32.207 --> 30:33.375
- Hey.
- Chelsea.

30:33.458 --> 30:36.837
I got something to say.
I got something to say.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.715
- Right now.
- Wow, you are really drunk.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.341
- You know? Oh!
- Oh.

30:41.425 --> 30:43.594
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Aniq!

30:43.677 --> 30:46.471
- I'm sorry.
- No. That's okay. It'll come out.

30:46.555 --> 30:49.725
- I'm just gonna rinse this. No, it's fine.
- That wasn't good. I am sorry.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.977
- Hey, Zo! Hey.
- Hi.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.061
- Okay, how are you?
- Yeah.

30:53.145 --> 30:55.355
Like-- I-- Hey! Um, hey.

30:55.439 --> 30:57.524
Or I could leave it.
I actually like it like this.

30:57.608 --> 30:59.401
Kinda makes the flowers pop.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.819
- Just leave it.
- We should go.

31:00.903 --> 31:03.989
- We got a cookie emergency to get to, so…
- Oh, totally.

31:04.072 --> 31:05.616
- Good luck with that.
- Let's just…

31:05.699 --> 31:07.034
What was that?

31:07.117 --> 31:09.995
Let's just get outta here
'cause I just wanna have some fun.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.122
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

31:15.501 --> 31:18.086
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm. Mmm.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.339
- That laugh.

31:20.422 --> 31:22.341
- You got something--
- Here?

31:22.424 --> 31:23.759
It's right there.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.178
Phew. You're welcome.

31:26.261 --> 31:29.389
I see a little bit of sugar
on your nose too.

31:29.473 --> 31:31.266
- There's more?
- I'm gonna help you get it.

31:31.350 --> 31:32.351
In all these places?

31:32.434 --> 31:37.189
One of the perks
of being vice-principal is…

31:37.272 --> 31:39.942
There is somewhere I have
kinda always wanted to go.

31:40.025 --> 31:43.070
The mysterious teachers' lounge.

31:43.153 --> 31:44.947
Ooh.

31:45.030 --> 31:47.950
Is it everything you dreamed it would be?

31:48.033 --> 31:50.869
This is where we keep
the confiscated drugs.

31:51.787 --> 31:52.955
Oh, my God!

31:53.038 --> 31:54.540
- Oh, Jesus!

31:54.623 --> 31:55.916
- Go, go, go, go!
- Oh!

31:57.543 --> 32:00.420
Was that Mr. Shapiro,
the science teacher, and Quiet Heather?

32:00.504 --> 32:02.256
Isn't it weird that I'm his boss now?

32:02.339 --> 32:04.758
I'm gonna have to have a discussion
with him on Monday.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.594
- Weed gummy?
- Oh. Yeah.

32:09.555 --> 32:11.974
- I'm already starting to feel it.
- You're already high?

32:12.057 --> 32:14.768
- Whoa! Zoë?
- Oh, okay.

32:14.852 --> 32:16.728
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

32:19.106 --> 32:21.024
- Okay. Prepare to be stunned.
- Okay.

32:21.108 --> 32:23.527
Okay. So you guys
go here, there, you banter.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.195
What happens after that? Did you kiss her?

32:25.279 --> 32:27.197
- I'm getting to it.
- This probably how she felt,

32:27.281 --> 32:30.784
like how I'm feeling right now.
Get to it already.

32:30.868 --> 32:34.121
Okay. It's kinda hard to talk about
'cause it gets a little sappy.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.999
Fifteen years. Wow.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.837
Mmm. Okay. So,

32:42.880 --> 32:44.965
- reunion questions.
- Okay.

32:45.716 --> 32:48.302
- Are you happy?
- Oh.

32:48.385 --> 32:50.846
Is your life everything
you hoped it would be?

32:50.929 --> 32:55.434
Uh, well, there are certainly things
that I wish were different.

32:56.018 --> 32:57.269
Yeah, I hear that.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.478
Yeah.

32:59.271 --> 33:01.815
Uh, sorry about your marriage.

33:02.399 --> 33:04.484
Me too. Thank you.

33:05.194 --> 33:08.614
A few months ago, I found out
he was cheating on me.

33:08.697 --> 33:10.991
And that was it.

33:11.742 --> 33:13.035
That sucks.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.581
I mean, so-- some people are jerks.

33:17.664 --> 33:21.668
He is, but he's not all bad.

33:22.461 --> 33:26.215
Like, he is a really great dad
to our daughter.

33:26.298 --> 33:31.094
I don't know. I guess if there's one thing
I've learned through this shitty situation

33:31.178 --> 33:34.181
is that people are more complicated
than we think.

33:35.349 --> 33:38.352
Like, what about you, Mr. Puzzle Man?

33:38.435 --> 33:39.811
- I feel like

33:39.895 --> 33:43.440
I could never really tell
what you were thinking in high school.

33:43.524 --> 33:45.192
Oh, well, I mean…

33:47.194 --> 33:48.987
maybe I was thinking

33:49.696 --> 33:55.869
that I had a little bit of a crush on you
back in the day.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.455
You never made a move.

33:59.831 --> 34:04.378
Well, I mean, you know,
it just never felt like the right moment.

34:10.884 --> 34:11.885
What?

34:11.969 --> 34:13.971
Oh, man.

34:14.054 --> 34:16.223
Does this ever happen?

34:16.306 --> 34:18.600
- I don't think so.

34:25.607 --> 34:26.817
Mommy!

34:27.734 --> 34:30.529
Maggie? What are you doing here?

34:30.612 --> 34:31.947
Family emergency.

34:32.030 --> 34:34.324
I called Brett, like, a thousand times,
but no answer.

34:34.408 --> 34:37.911
What? Forget what I said. He is the worst.
Okay, thank you.

34:37.995 --> 34:40.205
I will take it from here.

34:40.956 --> 34:41.956
All right.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.002
I got the Bacardí. It's Limón.

34:45.085 --> 34:49.630
I am so sorry. Do you mind, um,
keeping an eye on Maggie?

34:49.715 --> 34:52.801
I need to talk to her father
using some adult language.

34:52.885 --> 34:54.469
Absolutely. Yes.

34:54.553 --> 34:56.471
Great. Okay, Maggie,
I-- I'll be right back.

34:56.554 --> 34:57.556
Okay.

34:58.348 --> 35:00.267
Ah. Who's this?

35:00.350 --> 35:02.269
- This is Kevin Koala.
- Kevin Koala?

35:02.352 --> 35:04.062
Can I? Hey, thank you.

35:05.063 --> 35:08.108
Hello! My name's Kevin Koala.

35:08.192 --> 35:10.194
- You're silly.
- Oh, thank you.

35:10.277 --> 35:12.362
Did you put bones in my mommy?

35:12.446 --> 35:13.655
Um, sorry, what, hmm?

35:13.739 --> 35:16.742
Daddy said he had to make sure
no one boned Mommy tonight.

35:16.825 --> 35:20.746
- Did you do the bones?
- He said… …Ooh, ha!

35:20.829 --> 35:23.415
Uh…

35:23.498 --> 35:27.336
Uh, you know, let's ask Kevin, actually.
'Cause Kevin might know.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.505
Say, Kevin, what do you think?

35:29.588 --> 35:32.382
Well, that's a very sensitive subject.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.843
Oh, oh! No, no. Crikey! Hey, it's uh--

35:39.806 --> 35:41.642
No. No, no, no! No, no, no, no.

35:41.725 --> 35:43.143
- You gotta trust me on this--
- Daddy!

35:43.227 --> 35:44.436
Hey!

35:45.979 --> 35:47.189
Oh! Hey, guys!

35:47.272 --> 35:48.774
My juice tastes funny.

35:49.525 --> 35:52.110
- Um, whose is that?
- Oh, it's-- That's my juice actually.

35:52.194 --> 35:53.737
Mmm. Mmm.

35:54.404 --> 35:55.906
- Yuck.

35:59.368 --> 36:02.496
Yeah, this tastes fine to me.
Kids. Yeah.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.623
- You okay?
- Yes.

36:04.706 --> 36:05.874
Love juice.

36:08.126 --> 36:10.337
All right, Mags.
Daddy's gonna take you home.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.463
Okay.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.303
What were we talking about?

36:18.887 --> 36:21.431
Do you wanna maybe get a nightcap?

36:21.515 --> 36:23.976
Aren't you coming to Xavier's after-party?

36:24.059 --> 36:27.312
Oh, yeah.
Nah, yeah, I totally knew about that.

36:27.396 --> 36:29.815
You know, I-- I could drive us actually.

36:29.898 --> 36:31.900
But… …I forgot my invite.

36:31.984 --> 36:34.194
- Hey, hey.
- Hey!

36:34.278 --> 36:37.823
Oh, hey, Xavier. Speak of the… you.

36:37.906 --> 36:38.907
It's me.

36:38.991 --> 36:41.243
Hey, I was just about to head out
in my copter.

36:41.326 --> 36:43.787
Pretty sure you're coming to my house.
You need a ride?

36:43.871 --> 36:46.415
- Uh, we're actually gonna drive--
- Wait, for real?

36:47.332 --> 36:48.792
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

36:48.876 --> 36:50.210
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- Oh, wow.

36:50.294 --> 36:52.546
Wait, I would love to ride
in a helicopter tonight.

36:52.629 --> 36:55.465
Yeah, me too considering, uh,
all conditions are safe.

36:55.549 --> 36:58.093
It's interesting. You know, "helicopter"
comes from two words:

36:58.177 --> 37:00.053
- hélico, uh, and ptère.
- Really?

37:00.137 --> 37:01.805
Uh, ptère is to fly.

37:01.889 --> 37:04.516
- Yeah, no, that's-- that's interesting.
- Yeah, hélico is helix.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.101
You know, hey, go ahead.

37:06.185 --> 37:07.394
- I'll meet you there.
- Oh--

37:07.477 --> 37:11.231
Hey, um, you know, I'm just trying
to create, like, a fun, mellow energy.

37:11.315 --> 37:14.067
And I'm feeling, like,
a little anxious energy coming off of you.

37:14.151 --> 37:16.320
So, I just want her to have a good time,
you know.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.322
No. Xavier, no.

37:18.405 --> 37:21.241
You don't wanna deny Zoë
a little bit of fun, right? You get it.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.828
I mean, I'm serious about her, okay?

37:24.912 --> 37:26.955
That's good, man. I'm happy for you.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.875
But sometimes you gotta let people
make their own decisions.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.337
You should still come to the party though.
We'll see you there.

37:36.381 --> 37:39.009
Will you at least give me the address
so I know where to go?

37:43.096 --> 37:44.473
Wait, where's Aniq?

37:44.556 --> 37:47.643
He wanted us to have a good time.
He said he'll meet us there.

37:47.726 --> 37:49.186
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

37:51.605 --> 37:53.065
I'll see you there.

38:09.373 --> 38:12.709
Hold up. It was raining again?

38:12.793 --> 38:15.546
Well, it felt like it was raining.
You know, emotionally.

38:15.629 --> 38:16.755
But was it?

38:16.839 --> 38:18.382
No, it was dry.

38:22.803 --> 38:26.390
The door was closed, literally in my face.

38:30.310 --> 38:33.272
But then I had a look at that picture, and

38:34.356 --> 38:35.566
then it hit me.

38:37.317 --> 38:40.279
Holy shit. Holy shit. Are you okay?
Don't be dead. Don't be dead.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.906
- Don't be dead. Hello? Aniq?
- Oh.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.449
- Here we go. You okay?

38:44.533 --> 38:47.077
I think I swallowed a molar,
but I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

38:47.160 --> 38:50.414
- I gotta get to that party.
- No. We gotta get you to a hospital, okay?

38:50.497 --> 38:53.000
No.

38:53.083 --> 38:55.085
Zoë and me, we had a moment.

38:55.169 --> 38:57.546
- We almost kissed.
- That's incre-- See, that's incred--

38:57.629 --> 39:00.424
It almost makes you forget that
you just got run over by a car, right?

39:00.507 --> 39:01.675
I gotta get to that party.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.260
- This way. This way.
- Okay, Brett!

39:03.343 --> 39:07.848
Aniq made out with your ex-wife.
And now he's going back for more.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.058
- What? No.
- Aniq, I'm coming for you.

39:10.142 --> 39:12.728
- We're moving. Here we go. We got this.
- Why is she in the car?

39:12.811 --> 39:15.272
It's a whole thing. All right?
Let's go get your girl. Let's go.

39:15.355 --> 39:17.024
- Get in. Get those feet in!
- Aniq!

39:18.233 --> 39:20.736
No, no, no, no. Hey! Wait!

39:24.031 --> 39:25.282
- Whose car is this?

39:25.365 --> 39:29.328
This is my car that I purchased
because of my incredible business acumen.

39:29.411 --> 39:31.038
"Luxury Prestige Rentals."

39:31.121 --> 39:33.582
- That's-- Oh.
- Oh, my God. Luxurious.

39:33.665 --> 39:36.502
- Prestigious. Wow!
- No, that's a fake key chain,

39:36.585 --> 39:38.504
- my man and woman!
- No, it's not.

39:38.587 --> 39:40.714
- I need a drink.
- I just bought it so people would laugh.

39:40.797 --> 39:43.675
Wow. Yo! Oh, my God!

39:43.759 --> 39:48.013
Aniq, that's not for you.
Those are my personal things. You're nuts.

39:48.096 --> 39:51.058
- Hey! Hey! I'll kill all ya.
- Oh, my God. He's here.

39:51.141 --> 39:52.643
- What?
- I'll kill all ya!

39:52.726 --> 39:54.144
- What's he saying?
- What is he saying?

39:54.228 --> 39:56.563
Roll down the window! Roll it down.
I'll kill all of ya!

39:56.647 --> 39:58.190
Oh, my God. He's gonna do it!

39:58.273 --> 39:59.483
- Go. Go, go, go!
- No, he's not.

39:59.566 --> 40:00.859
- The light is red.
- Hit the shift!

40:00.943 --> 40:03.153
- I'll kill all of ya!
- Please go! Go!

40:03.237 --> 40:04.530
Kill all of ya!

40:04.613 --> 40:07.074
- Go, go, go!
- Yeah, the speed limit. You got it, man.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.660
- The speed limit, here it comes.
- Oh, my God. What a idiot!

40:11.662 --> 40:13.997
Oh, my God. He's right behind us.
Can't we go any faster?

40:14.081 --> 40:16.375
It's a rental! You got me. I lied.
It's a rental.

40:16.458 --> 40:19.461
I did it to try to impress you guys.
If I scratch it, I'm screwed.

40:19.545 --> 40:20.754
Yeah, no kidding, pal.

40:20.838 --> 40:22.631
No, you didn't know.
You know now.

40:22.714 --> 40:25.175
If anything bad happens,
I promise I'll help pay for it, okay?

40:25.259 --> 40:26.426
Or at least help. Eventually.

40:26.510 --> 40:28.428
What are you talking about--
What are you doing? Dude!

40:28.512 --> 40:29.930
- Taking a shortcut.
- Whoo!

40:33.684 --> 40:35.811
- Whoo!

40:35.894 --> 40:38.689
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna throw up.
- No, not in the car, bud.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.148
I gotta get to Zoë.

40:45.279 --> 40:46.822
Whoa. This is a bit much.

40:47.406 --> 40:49.449
Don't mind if I do.

40:49.533 --> 40:50.826
- To love.
- Ooh.

40:50.909 --> 40:53.537
- Uh, take it easy, Lightweight. Come on.
- Ah. I'm fine.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.622
Yeah, I just had, like,
a half a weed gummy.

40:55.706 --> 40:57.416
So I'm, like, really feeling it.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.502
But, you know…
…I just gotta find Zoë.

41:00.586 --> 41:02.588
Dude, I don't think
a bite of an edible did this.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.423
Look at me.
How much have you had to drink?

41:04.506 --> 41:07.176
Then suddenly everything got real hazy.

41:07.259 --> 41:12.014
Uh, just a-- just a couple,
uh, whiskeys, a wine.

41:12.097 --> 41:15.017
- Oh. Wh-Wh-Whoa!
- Whoa, Aniq.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.562
- You okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hmm? Yeah, no, I'm good. Whoo!

41:18.645 --> 41:20.731
This is a little--
little dizzy spell. Uh--

41:20.814 --> 41:22.107
- Oh!
- Try to stand up straight.

41:22.191 --> 41:23.233
- That one was on purpose.
- Oh!

41:23.317 --> 41:26.653
- Not that one, right? You're going back--
- That one wasn't. Yeah. I gotta find Zo.

41:28.238 --> 41:31.158
But there is one thing that
I absolutely remember crystal clear…

41:31.241 --> 41:34.036
- Oh.
- And you're also attractive yourself.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.871
- Stop, really?
- Brett showing up.

41:35.954 --> 41:39.291
Hey! Been looking all over for you.

41:39.374 --> 41:41.752
You should ease off a little bit. Mmm.

41:41.835 --> 41:44.046
- You're a bad person.
- What?

41:44.129 --> 41:45.506
Shove.

41:45.589 --> 41:47.758
- Brett?

41:47.841 --> 41:51.887
Oh, dead! Dead!

41:51.970 --> 41:55.182
Aniq! Whoa! Are you okay?

41:55.265 --> 41:57.434
Yeah, Brett knocked me into some shrimp.

41:57.518 --> 41:59.311
You took 'em all out though, huh?

41:59.394 --> 42:02.022
We're about to fight, aren't we?

42:02.105 --> 42:05.275
Yeah, that's what I said.

42:05.359 --> 42:07.569
Yellow giraffe.

42:07.653 --> 42:09.613
- Oops, aggressive.
- Yellow giraffe!

42:09.696 --> 42:12.199
I don't remember
what happened next with Xavier and Brett,

42:12.282 --> 42:14.243
'cause I saw Zoë on the staircase.

42:14.993 --> 42:16.870
I'll be right back.

42:16.954 --> 42:18.330
And I knew this was it.

42:18.914 --> 42:21.834
This was my last chance
to tell her how I really felt.

42:28.841 --> 42:31.677
So I did a flaming Jell-O shot
to muster up some courage.

42:33.470 --> 42:34.471
And…

42:35.806 --> 42:36.807
I passed out.

42:36.890 --> 42:39.893
- Well, that is very unsatisfying.
- Yeah.

42:40.394 --> 42:44.064
Now I was here for your romantic romp
until we switched genres

42:44.147 --> 42:46.817
into some abstract bullshit.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.944
What happened after you woke up?

42:49.027 --> 42:51.154
How great is this party?

42:57.160 --> 42:58.787
- Wh--
- Solo!

43:01.874 --> 43:03.250
- What happened?
- Ned!

43:03.333 --> 43:05.586
- Uh, wh--

43:05.669 --> 43:07.671
- Yes!
- Why are my--

43:07.754 --> 43:09.089
Why are my pants down?

43:10.299 --> 43:12.593
What is going on? Why am I wet?

43:12.676 --> 43:14.595
Dude, you're soaking wet. What happened?

43:14.678 --> 43:15.888
- Who did this?
- Uh…

43:15.971 --> 43:18.807
- It was Xavier, wasn't it?
- No. Bet it's someone just having fun.

43:18.891 --> 43:21.476
He keeps doing this to me.
But you know what?

43:21.560 --> 43:24.813
I'm gonna explain to him that
it's not okay to treat people like this.

43:25.314 --> 43:27.399
Hey. Are-- Are you okay?

43:30.152 --> 43:31.695
There's some things I need to tell you.

43:33.655 --> 43:36.575
But first, I gotta go see about
this asshole.

43:37.868 --> 43:40.120
Uh, not-- Uh, not my asshole.

43:40.204 --> 43:43.165
I mean, I'm…
…talkin' about-- about somebody else.

43:43.248 --> 43:45.751
Not somebody else's asshole.

43:45.834 --> 43:46.960
I'll be right back.

43:47.711 --> 43:48.712
Okay.

43:48.795 --> 43:50.172
I wasn't gonna hurt him.

43:50.255 --> 43:52.716
I was just hoping that
maybe Zoë would follow me.

43:52.799 --> 43:55.093
I'd tell Xavier once and for all…

43:55.177 --> 43:56.303
Xavier?

43:56.386 --> 43:58.472
…even though
I'd missed my chance with Zoë…

43:58.555 --> 43:59.556
Xavier?

43:59.640 --> 44:01.141
…he wasn't worthy of her.

44:01.225 --> 44:03.852
She'd overhear and realize
I was the man of her dreams.

44:03.936 --> 44:05.103
Xavier?

44:05.187 --> 44:06.647
But there was no one there.

44:07.648 --> 44:09.525
And then I saw my face.

44:12.069 --> 44:13.070
No!

44:13.570 --> 44:15.822
- Oh, no!

44:15.906 --> 44:18.617
- Someone call 911!

44:22.371 --> 44:23.372
Oh, no.

44:25.165 --> 44:27.501
Came downstairs to hear
that they found Xavier's body.

44:28.585 --> 44:29.586
The end.

44:30.170 --> 44:33.674
Wow. Your third act got some problems.

44:33.757 --> 44:35.259
But I can't root for you, bud.

44:35.342 --> 44:36.927
- What?
- Mm-mmm.

44:37.010 --> 44:40.430
You admitted to having
a bitter rivalry with Xavier.

44:40.514 --> 44:43.267
You also admitted to feeling like he was

44:43.350 --> 44:46.103
- getting in your way with Zoë.
- Well, that's because--

44:46.186 --> 44:49.147
You admitted to going upstairs
to confront him

44:49.231 --> 44:51.942
- before he was found dead.
- But I said that--

44:52.025 --> 44:56.405
I mean, you admitted to everything
that would lead you to being the murderer

44:56.488 --> 44:59.116
except for the actual murder.

44:59.199 --> 45:04.246
Uh, oh. No, w-w-wait, wait, wait.
Sure I was-- I was mad at Xavier, y-yeah.

45:04.329 --> 45:07.499
But what about Brett?
He was up there on the balcony, pissed.

45:07.583 --> 45:12.045
Brett hated Xavier more than anybody.
Plus, he's a proven shover.

45:12.129 --> 45:14.339
I'm not talking about Brett.
I'm talking about you.

45:14.423 --> 45:17.426
- Look, I told everyone…
- Mm-hmm.

45:17.509 --> 45:19.636
…that I was going upstairs
to talk to Xavier.

45:19.720 --> 45:24.016
Why would I do that and then kill him?
That would be super dumb.

45:24.099 --> 45:27.853
Love makes you do dumb things.
Maybe that's not even when you did it.

45:27.936 --> 45:32.524
You said you had four drinks,
a Jell-O shot, and then you passed out.

45:32.608 --> 45:34.484
That's a hard buy, even for a lightweight.

45:34.568 --> 45:38.822
Are you suggesting
that I faked passing out

45:38.906 --> 45:42.284
and just let everybody
write all over my face like this?

45:42.367 --> 45:44.828
Well, this interview is done. Thank you.

45:44.912 --> 45:46.705
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.

45:46.788 --> 45:48.790
No, no, no.
We didn't get off on no feet, okay?

45:48.874 --> 45:50.375
I have other houseguests to interview.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.710
- 'Cause there's some--
- Thank you.

45:53.545 --> 45:55.881
There's my guy! How'd it go with the cops?

45:55.964 --> 45:57.883
- Horrible. She thinks I did it.
- Horrible?

45:57.966 --> 46:00.427
She's never gonna find the real killer.

46:12.523 --> 46:15.067
You can solve this yourself.
You don't need to rely on her.

46:15.150 --> 46:17.152
- You okay, man?

46:18.529 --> 46:21.073
Oh! You know, I'm--
I'm a professional puzzle maker, you know?

46:21.156 --> 46:22.699
This is just another puzzle to solve.

46:22.783 --> 46:25.536
Yes, that's right.
Dude, you create escape rooms.

46:25.619 --> 46:29.998
So think about it like this: if you solve
this case, the room you escape is prison.

46:30.082 --> 46:32.960
You know, there's evidence somewhere.
We just have to find it.

46:40.843 --> 46:41.844
What?

46:52.437 --> 46:54.857
"This is payback
for what you did to me."

46:55.482 --> 46:57.025
Holy shit.

46:58.193 --> 47:00.279
Illustrated man, you in there?

47:01.196 --> 47:02.781
Just a minute.

47:02.865 --> 47:04.575
- What are you gonna do?
- Uh, just…

47:06.702 --> 47:09.413
- I saw you run off pretty quick.
- Mmm.

47:09.496 --> 47:11.582
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

47:11.665 --> 47:13.333
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

47:13.417 --> 47:15.502
- Did I interrupt anything in here?
- No.

47:15.586 --> 47:19.339
Danner. This man was just caught
outside sneaking into his car.

47:19.423 --> 47:21.300
- I wasn't sneaking.
- He was sneaking.

47:21.967 --> 47:25.304
The grip is real tight!
Tell him to loosen up, ma'am.

47:25.387 --> 47:26.930
- Keep squeezing.
- Oh, shit!

47:27.014 --> 47:29.725
Beefcake,
time to hear your version of the night.
