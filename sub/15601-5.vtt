16:17.700 --> 16:21.067
>> I knew it was Trip's fault.

16:21.067 --> 16:21.567
>> You guys,

16:21.567 --> 16:22.400
come check out the MeGo game

16:22.400 --> 16:23.233
Kenzie and I have been

16:23.233 --> 16:23.833
working on.

16:23.833 --> 16:24.500
>> Cool, let's see it.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.067
>> I'm excited.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.133
>> I want to see that.

16:26.133 --> 16:26.900
>> Trip.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.867
Trip, wait up.

16:28.867 --> 16:29.933
>> What you want?

16:29.933 --> 16:30.733
>> Guess what I found

16:30.733 --> 16:31.933
on the roof?

16:31.933 --> 16:33.600
>> What?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.567
>> A million dollars.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.233
>> [ gasps ]

16:38.233 --> 16:40.067
You saw a million dollars

16:40.067 --> 16:41.367
up on the roof?

16:41.367 --> 16:42.433
>> That's right.

16:42.433 --> 16:45.267
In a bag.

16:45.267 --> 16:46.900
Would you like me to show you?

16:46.900 --> 16:48.867
>> Yeah, I would.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.433
>> Then follow me.

16:53.133 --> 16:55.800
>> I'll be back in a sec.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.567
Catch you later.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.800
>> Bye.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.700
>> What is MeGo doing there

16:59.700 --> 17:01.467
with those octopuses?

17:01.467 --> 17:02.933
>> Thank you.

17:07.367 --> 17:08.300
>> Here we are.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.633
>> Well, open the door.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.467
Let's find that cash.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.067
So, where's the million dollars?

17:19.067 --> 17:19.533
>> I think

17:19.533 --> 17:21.800
it's right over there.

17:33.533 --> 17:34.467
>> Okay, I don't see a bag

17:34.467 --> 17:36.067
or a million dollars.

17:36.067 --> 17:36.600
All I see

17:36.600 --> 17:38.567
is an air conditioning unit

17:38.567 --> 17:41.633
and a dead bird.

17:41.633 --> 17:42.800
>> Strange.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.633
Perhaps the bag

17:44.633 --> 17:45.700
of a million dollars

17:45.700 --> 17:47.633
fell over the edge.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.933
>> Hmm.

18:00.267 --> 18:01.667
>> And see, you try to get MeGo

18:01.667 --> 18:03.600
to hug the purple pelicans.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.933
>> Purple pelicans, you hug.

18:04.933 --> 18:07.067
Red pelicans are poisonous.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.667
>> Ha. Poisonous.

18:08.667 --> 18:12.200
I love that.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.467
>> My dad's a pelican.

18:15.467 --> 18:16.400
>> No.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.933
Your dad's a dentist.

18:17.933 --> 18:19.767
>> Well, either way,

18:19.767 --> 18:21.933
this is a good pretzel.

18:24.633 --> 18:25.900
>> Hey, Dub, look.

18:25.900 --> 18:26.533
Me and Ruthless found

18:26.533 --> 18:28.400
these pineapples at a market.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.300
>> So we brought you some!

18:30.300 --> 18:31.133
>> I thought I told you two

18:31.133 --> 18:33.467
to stay in the limo.

18:33.467 --> 18:36.700
>> I told you he'd be mad at us!

18:36.700 --> 18:37.300
>> Can we please

18:37.300 --> 18:38.700
get back to the game?

18:38.700 --> 18:39.433
>> Yeah.

18:39.433 --> 18:40.300
And where's Trip?

18:40.300 --> 18:41.800
We need his feedback on this.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.467
>> He went off with MeGo.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.933
>> Where?

18:44.933 --> 18:46.700
>> Oh. I can find them.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.467
>> How?

18:47.467 --> 18:48.300
>> MeGo has a camera

18:48.300 --> 18:49.133
in his head.

18:49.133 --> 18:49.900
I can access it

18:49.900 --> 18:52.300
and see where they are.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.400
>> Trouble on the roof!

18:53.400 --> 18:54.933
Trouble on the roof!

18:55.733 --> 18:56.933

18:58.300 --> 18:58.867
>> What?

18:58.867 --> 18:59.533
>> Holy...

18:59.533 --> 19:00.633
>> I knew it.

19:00.633 --> 19:01.600
That robo bot's trying

19:01.600 --> 19:03.100
to throw my boy off the roof.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.867
Come on, let's go.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.500
Leave those pineapples here.

Ugh. Ugh.

19:22.833 --> 19:23.667
Get off of me.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.100
Get off of me.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.067
>> What are we going to do?

19:26.067 --> 19:26.867
>> Okay.

19:26.867 --> 19:27.533
Why don't I send

19:27.533 --> 19:29.533
the building manager an email?

19:29.533 --> 19:30.600
I'll write, "Dear sir"--

19:30.600 --> 19:31.667
>> Ruthless.

19:31.667 --> 19:32.333
>> What do you need?

19:32.333 --> 19:33.467
>> Open that door.

19:33.467 --> 19:34.833
>> Okay!

19:44.200 --> 19:44.833
>> Bunny, Ruthless,

19:44.833 --> 19:46.133
call the cops.

19:46.133 --> 19:46.967
Trip!

19:46.967 --> 19:47.533
>> Dad!

19:47.533 --> 19:50.800
>> Stay back.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.533
I have a finger laser.

19:52.533 --> 19:53.367
I'll use it.

19:53.367 --> 19:53.967
>> Now, listen here,

MeGo.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.667
MeGo.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.367
You don't want to hurt anybody.

20:07.367 --> 20:09.367
>> Yes I do.

20:09.367 --> 20:10.467
I want to push Trip

20:10.467 --> 20:11.433
off this roof

20:11.433 --> 20:12.433
so I can have Hudson

20:12.433 --> 20:14.933
all to myself.

20:14.933 --> 20:16.467
>> But if you push Trip

20:16.467 --> 20:17.700
off the roof,

20:17.700 --> 20:20.733
you'll make Hudson very sad.

20:20.733 --> 20:22.700
>> And if you do something mean

20:22.700 --> 20:24.300
that makes Hudson sad,

20:24.300 --> 20:26.567
then he won't want to be

I don't know what to do.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.933
>> Here's an idea, MeGo.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.033
Throw yourself off the roof.

20:36.033 --> 20:36.433
>> No.

>> Geez, man.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.433
>> I'm sorry, I'm upset.

20:39.433 --> 20:40.733

20:40.733 --> 20:43.300
we can't all be friends.
