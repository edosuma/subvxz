01:26.962 --> 01:28.982
well, the weekend forecast
looking good for the area.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.918
Sunny skies on tap from brentwood
all the way north to Richmond

01:32.009 --> 01:35.217
and throughout the state of Virginia,
with highs reaching 85 degrees.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.135
Low tonight, about 65.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.804
Should be a great weekend
for hikers to get out and enjoy...

01:55.282 --> 01:56.818
Pretty girl.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.444
You must be one proud papa.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.325
Who's the black fella?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.703
Darius clemmons. It's her boyfriend.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.786
They were traveling
with a group of their friends.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.986
Well, the appalachian trail's
a hefty piece of real estate.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.217
I mean, Maine clear down to Georgia way.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.886
I've been tracking their route,

02:19.973 --> 02:23.340
and she promised to call
or text every week.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.096
And it's been six weeks.

02:25.187 --> 02:29.556
The last place that she
texted me was here in your town.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.397
Well, the fact is we get a shit-ton
of kids that come through here.

02:34.488 --> 02:39.073
I mean, they come, and they do
whatever it is they do, and they move on.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.822
My boy's down in tampa
playing keyboard in some rockabilly band.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.974
I can't remember the last time
that boy picked up a phone.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.408
My daughter's not like that.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.286
Well, we can make it official
if you'd like.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.955
Fill out this missing persons report.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.086
Be as detailed as you'd like.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.592
But if I were to put money on it,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.797
I'd say she's somewhere
sunning herself in the keys.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.843
Guest checkout is automatic.
I rarely see them leave.

03:07.938 --> 03:12.398
Most are gone by sun up,
trying to catch flights or beat traffic.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.128
And there was nothing
left in the room?

03:14.152 --> 03:16.234
No. And their car was gone.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.561
Okay, well,

03:17.656 --> 03:21.569
if you think of anything,
please give me a call, yeah?

03:22.244 --> 03:23.244
My name's Scott.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.745
You spoke to the police chief?

03:27.833 --> 03:28.993
Yeah.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.949
I didn't sense much urgency from him.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.160
This is a quiet town.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.246
The quieter it is,
the more he gets to fish.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.052
Hey, it's Jen.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.052
Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.
Thanks, bye.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.259
Look again. Please.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.434
No, sorry, no.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.979
You know how many tourists
come through here?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.182
I remember drinks, not faces.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.318
Lose something?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.448
My daughter.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.200
Her name is Jennifer.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.655
She passed through here
with five of her friends.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.199
They're all about the same age.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, I seen 'em.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.661
Goddamn yuppies.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.798
You didn't happen to notice
which way they went?

04:19.885 --> 04:20.885
North, maybe.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.755
Up on the at.

04:23.597 --> 04:28.591
But if they got lost in them woods,
you might as well just go on home,

04:28.977 --> 04:31.093
'cause you ain't never gonna find 'em.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.395
Yeah, well...

04:35.275 --> 04:38.062
I don't believe that. I can't.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.065
Believe what you want, mister.
But know this...

04:42.115 --> 04:44.197
Out there,

04:44.284 --> 04:49.654
nature eats everything it catches
right down to the bone.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.830
Doesn't give a shit if it's a cute girl.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.834
Do you have kids?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.755
What would you do?

05:49.599 --> 05:51.079
What do you think of this one?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.221
Yeah, it's-it's fine.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.302
- Adam, come on.
- What? What the fuck?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.375
- I need that.
- I want to show you the picture.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.959
- Give me my phone.
- No!

05:58.984 --> 06:00.645
Hey. Babe, you're fine.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.101
Just breathe.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.902
Open your mind.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.196
Enjoy it, okay?

06:06.283 --> 06:09.116
- Look at that one.
- Is that how sad I look all the time?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.908
Yes, you do, actually.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.032
I must really love you.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.081
You really do.
It's-it's weird how much you love...

06:16.167 --> 06:17.498
You're weird.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.618
Now kiss me.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.172
- Whoa!
- Ah!

06:29.431 --> 06:32.969
You know, uh,
you're making me look bad.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.926
- Sorry.
- Don't be. Fucking girl power.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.558
Girl power.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.936
Dude, where'd you
learn how to do this?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.892
My dad.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.147
He taught me two things:

06:45.238 --> 06:48.321
How to bait a hook
and how to change a tire.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.364
My dad taught me how to put in a tampon.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.277
Single parent.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.861
His eyes were closed the whole time.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.162
Not a good experience.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.864
Uh...

07:01.296 --> 07:03.287
Oh.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.621
- Oh, here we go.
- Sweet.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.130
Jen, Jen, Jen.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.798
My fucking hero.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.554
It's quaint.

07:13.642 --> 07:18.727
Yeah, especially if you miss
the good old days of the confederacy.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.190
All right.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.817
This one's mine.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.719
- That's yours, babe.
- Trying to grab yours.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.949
Pass me mine.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.997
- Three rooms for two nights.
- Yes.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.922
Policies of the inn
are posted in your rooms.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.748
No alcohol on the patio.

07:48.843 --> 07:52.006
No candles in the room,
no loud music or raucous activity.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.258
Hear that, boys? Behave yourselves.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.386
Thanks. And don't worry.
I'll keep them on a short leash.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.017
Have you been here before?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.524
First time.
Just doing a little hiking.

08:06.611 --> 08:11.275
Piece of advice,
keep to the marked trail.

08:11.366 --> 08:15.154
The land here can be unforgiving.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.413
Thanks. We'll be careful.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.970
You know that a bunch of abolitionists
came from this town?

08:44.065 --> 08:47.978
Darius loves that shit.
Fucking history, baby.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.606
Back when people actually fought
for what they believed in.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.467
Listen, by the way, what was that...
What was that thing earlier?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.231
Why wouldn't you hold my hand?

08:55.326 --> 08:56.941
Nothing. No reason.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.277
Oh, there's a reason.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.412
Same reason Darius is on edge.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.784
- Adam.
- Dude.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.788
What? He's a black dude
with a white girlfriend

09:05.879 --> 09:07.244
in bum-fuck Virginia.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.208
Hey.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.880
Y'all ain't from around here, are you?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.886
What gave us away?

09:20.977 --> 09:22.183
Uh, yeah.

09:22.270 --> 09:26.058
We're just, uh, checking out
the appalachian trail.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.856
Couple days of hiking.
Nothing extreme.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.808
There's something dangerous up there.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.362
So if you got any questions
or you need a guide,

09:34.449 --> 09:36.906
me and my pals over here,
we, uh, we know this land

09:36.993 --> 09:39.405
like the back of our hands.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.033
Thanks. Thanks. I think we're good.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.201
It's your life.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.250
But, uh, if you change your mind...

09:48.213 --> 09:49.999
We'll always be around.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.215
Driving around in a shitty pickup,
sipping moonshine, am I right?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.511
Stop it.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.804
What'd you say, peckerwood?

09:59.891 --> 10:02.007
Excuse my fiancé.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.640
He forgets that talking to people
isn't like commenting on reddit.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.805
Don't look at me, boy.

10:10.735 --> 10:14.774
You goddamn hipster freaks
are the problem with this whole world.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.230
I'm betting not a goddamn one of you

10:17.325 --> 10:20.317
ever worked a real fucking job
in your life.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.120
So you better sit the fuck still
and behave yourself.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.789
You're wrong.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.376
Jen.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.048
My boyfriend, Darius,
runs a sustainable energy nonprofit.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.672
Milla's an oncologist.
Adam's an app developer.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.253
And Gary and Luis own a pair
of New York bistros.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.135
I don't know. I'd call those real jobs.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.304
And what about you, sweetheart?

10:46.396 --> 10:47.602
I have two master's.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.395
Art history and dance.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.347
Which means I make coffee for a living.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.351
But right now I'm looking at you,

10:54.445 --> 10:56.048
and I'm seeing some
yellowing in your eyes.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.233
Which means what, Milla? Hmm?

10:58.324 --> 11:01.407
Oh, um, it could be liver problems.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.611
Jaundice, hepatitis, Gilbert syndrome.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.322
You should probably
see a doctor, actually.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.377
All right, well...

11:13.464 --> 11:15.796
You kids be safe.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.501
Maybe we'll see you again.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.301
Seriously, do not do that ever again.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.415
- I can't handle that.
- Dude, why do we let you drink?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.679
Because usually I'm very funny.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.185
No, actually, you have never,
ever been funny.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.482
Like, never.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.934
Where are the drinks?

11:39.365 --> 11:40.730
You know this song.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.611
Do you know this?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.658
No, but it's a good song.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.885
Okay, people, 8:00 A.M.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.007
Luis, Gary, I'm talking to you.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.759
Okay, I'm not a morning person.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.841
If I don't get my eight hours,
I will be a zombie.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.830
- Be a zombie who hikes.
- Hey, guys.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.015
- Guys.
- What?

12:12.106 --> 12:14.597
Who's that by the car?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.808
Is that one of those assholes
from the bar?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.768
Yeah, probably.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.819
- Hey.
- Adam.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.863
- Relax.
- Hey!

12:22.951 --> 12:24.942
Get away from the car, man.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.115
Get away from there. Shoo.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.117
- He's not a dog.
- Yo!

12:30.208 --> 12:33.450
Are you deaf or something?
Back the fuck off!

12:34.462 --> 12:38.171
Jesus, Adam, are you trying
to piss off everyone in middle America?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.919
You gotta be tough with these people.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.419
Okay, big guy, time for bed.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.751
- Come on.
- Back me up here.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.460
Adam.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.045
Come on, forget about it.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.755
Where the hell did that guy go?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.511
Come on.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.217
Hi this is Scott.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.290
Leave a message and I'll get
right back to you. Thank you.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.181
Hey, dad. Sorry to call so late.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.187
We're still hiking the appalachian trail.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.238
When I get back,
I promise I'll give you an answer

13:00.280 --> 13:01.861
about what I plan to do.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.190
I love you.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.571
Say hi to Corinne.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.493
Maybe she'll say hi back for a change.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.368
Okay, talk soon.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.165
Bye.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.165
So is Adam right?

13:18.256 --> 13:19.712
Are you on edge?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.040
We can go home right now.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.719
Hey, nice try,
but you don't have to protect me.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.095
You know why I work in nonprofit
instead of on wall street?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.808
Because...

13:42.071 --> 13:44.904
I want to build a community
where people are valued

13:44.991 --> 13:48.734
on their skills and their character.

13:50.913 --> 13:55.873
Not their bank account
or their skin color.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.035
Everyone works.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.288
Everyone shares.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.092
I'd give anything for that.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.591
I know.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.016
That's why I love you.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.687
These are beautiful.
Did you make all this?

15:04.654 --> 15:06.019
Some.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.484
Hey.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.157
I'm Jen. What's your name?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.867
Don't mind ruthie.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.289
She don't like to talk.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.207
I was shy too at her age.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.127
- Is she yours?
- In a manner.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.126
It takes a village to raise a child,
isn't that what they say?

15:26.926 --> 15:27.961
How much?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.337
Ten dollars.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.973
Thanks.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.105
Good morning.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.023
I've literally never seen you wear this.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.976
- Wow. Wow.
- Okay.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.317
Yeah!

15:51.659 --> 15:53.820
Walk of shame.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.044
Hey, what's up, you guys?
Me and Gary are going on a hike.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.917
I didn't know that you were filming.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.340
Everyone's here.
Yeah, it's for a YouTube video.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.316
Catch me.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.068
Oh, my god! Help!

16:30.656 --> 16:34.023
Oh, it's beautiful. Nature.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.109
Is anyone still drunk from last night?

16:36.204 --> 16:38.115
Bitch, I am.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.696
That last shot was a bad idea.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.327
Wait, looks like the trail ends.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.160
Are we going this way,
or are we going this way?

16:45.254 --> 16:47.119
Do you have signal on your phone?

16:47.632 --> 16:48.712
No.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.883
- I can do that.
- I've been horrible.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.303
- Look at that.
- This is fucking awesome!

16:58.059 --> 16:59.799
Whoo!

17:07.401 --> 17:09.016
It's up here.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.147
Okay?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.212
Do you know where we're going?

17:49.277 --> 17:50.141
I don't.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.817
Do you know where we're going?

17:55.700 --> 17:58.533
Okay, quick little side trip, guys.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.155
- What?
- There's supposed to be

18:00.246 --> 18:02.737
a very well-preserved
civil war fort near here.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.948
Cool. Let's find it.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.579
Um, the woman at the inn
said we shouldn't leave the trail.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.535
It's just a quick look around.

18:09.630 --> 18:13.043
Babe, if we don't find anything,
we'll just cut back over to the trail.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.626
You know what we wouldn't have found
if we would have stayed on the trail?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.928
Hmm? The waterfall.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.472
And that cliff, hmm?

18:21.559 --> 18:24.050
Come on. We'll be good.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.349
- Okay.
- Okay?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.023
She said yes!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.351
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Let's do it.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.798
What does that mean?
They getting married?

18:34.822 --> 18:36.382
Wait, just for the hike, right?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.032
You good?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.411
Such a hiker.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.334
What was that?

18:54.425 --> 18:56.131
- A snake.
- Oh, my god.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.589
- You okay?
- Yeah.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.558
We're good.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.893
- Shit. Yeah, thanks.
- Fuck.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.573
Ah!

19:26.415 --> 19:27.530
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.533
Dar, how much longer
is this gonna take?

19:30.628 --> 19:33.495
Look, it's just a little further, okay?
I promise, okay?

19:33.589 --> 19:34.669
Please.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.293
- You okay?
- No!

19:39.136 --> 19:41.252
We got to go.
We got to keep going.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.742
We've been walking
for fucking hours.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.630
That's what we've been doing.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.536
We've been walking
way more than an hour.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.680
What are you talking about?
It's been like four hours.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.290
- Four hours?
- No, I mean...

19:50.314 --> 19:52.020
I mean, since we passed that thing.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.644
You know what?

19:53.734 --> 19:57.522
Why don't you guys
just, um, just head back to the trail.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.978
I'll meet you guys up there.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.236
What is that?

20:09.250 --> 20:12.037
Oh, my god! Adam!

20:12.128 --> 20:13.743
- Oh, my god!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.290
You guys, move left!

20:54.837 --> 20:56.373
Adam?

20:58.007 --> 21:00.043
Milla. Hey.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.294
You left me.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.307
- What?
- You left me.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.054
I know. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.145
I was freaking out.
I didn't know what I was doing.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.770
- You left Mel
- I know. I'm sorry.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.893
You left me!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.724
Please, don't do that again!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.730
I'm so sorry, okay?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.482
Come here.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.734
Oh, fuck.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.440
Jen? Jen?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.028
Jen! Jen!

21:30.998 --> 21:31.998
Are you okay?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.245
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.873
Oh, my god, Darius! Your finger!

21:37.963 --> 21:39.373
Oh, fuck!

21:40.716 --> 21:43.082
We're okay. Oh, fuck.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.592
Where's Luis and Gary?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.010
Huh?

21:58.025 --> 22:00.107
Oh, shit.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.823
Luis. Luis, man. Get out of here.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.304
Come on. Let's go over here. Come on.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.613
No, no, no, no.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.535
- No, no! No!
- Let's go over here.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.739
Do not fucking touch me!

22:16.502 --> 22:18.208
Okay.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.829
No, no, no.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.291
Oh, fucking shit.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.885
We need to call for help.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.842
I can't... I can't find my phone.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.015
I can't find my phone. Help me find it.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.764
Oh, fuck. No service.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.641
We need to go to higher ground.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.596
I'm going to climb up
and try and make a call.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.058
There's no way we're going to go
back up there, okay?

22:42.152 --> 22:44.985
- I'll find a way around.
- What fucking way around?

22:45.072 --> 22:48.109
- Not by yourself.
- Jen... this is my fault.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.441
It goddamn is.
It is your goddamn fault!

22:52.079 --> 22:53.910
Luis! Hey! Hey!

22:53.998 --> 22:56.226
It's nobody's fault, okay?
Did Darius make the tree fall?

22:56.250 --> 22:58.411
Look at me.
Did Darius make the tree fall? No.

22:58.502 --> 23:02.370
This is fucking awful, okay?
But it's nobody's fault, okay?

23:04.008 --> 23:08.217
Luis, I'm sorry, man!
I'm fucking sorry, man!

23:08.304 --> 23:11.171
I'll go by myself. I'll go right now.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.801
We all have to go.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.008
- Why?
- I can't leave him.

23:16.812 --> 23:21.181
If it rains,
which it looks like it's about to...

23:23.235 --> 23:25.021
We're exposed out here, guys.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.771
This slope's not safe.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.819
I think... I think someone's up there.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.280
- What?
- Someone's up there.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.292
- I don't... I don't see anyone.
- Where are they?

23:45.466 --> 23:49.550
I saw someone. I did.
I-l saw someone.

23:49.637 --> 23:50.968
This is so fucked up.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.465
I saw someone.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.046
It's okay.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.433
Fuck this. Fuck this!

24:10.491 --> 24:11.856
You okay?

24:17.706 --> 24:19.162
Thanks.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.369
No problem.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.761
He won't be here long.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.130
No one's gonna admit it.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.213
So I will.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.632
We're lost!

25:20.185 --> 25:22.050
Just admit it, Darius.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.518
- No fucking clue where we are.
- Hey. Hey. We're fine.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.348
We're-we're cutting across the mountain,

25:28.444 --> 25:30.935
and eventually,
we'll hit the at on the other side.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.487
But I think that we can probably
camp out for the night.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.281
I'm not leaving Gary
out there in the woods overnight

25:36.368 --> 25:39.485
for animals and insects
and whatever the fuck!

25:39.580 --> 25:41.320
That's not Gary anymore.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.206
Luis, that was his body.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.329
His spirit's moved on.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.290
That's what he believed, right?

25:50.257 --> 25:53.124
He's in paradise now. He's happy.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.630
Come here, man.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.935
Okay?

26:11.028 --> 26:12.518
Okay.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.113
Can you pull this?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.681
Oh, fuck.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.645
Thank god it stopped raining.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.780
Where's Milla?

27:39.867 --> 27:40.867
Hmm?

27:41.869 --> 27:44.155
I-1 didn't feel her get up.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.154
She probably went somewhere to pee.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.624
Milla?

27:56.258 --> 27:57.839
Jesus.

28:01.263 --> 28:02.844
We've been sleeping in a graveyard.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.172
Hey, guys, come check this out.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.553
What?

28:07.644 --> 28:09.009
I ook at this.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.896
This is a declaration pledge
to the foundation of America.

28:12.983 --> 28:16.191
You mean the confederacy.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.143
Long live slavery.

28:19.156 --> 28:23.695
Uh, no, actually, this is...
Dated before the war.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.151
"November 24, 1859."

28:26.246 --> 28:28.737
There's like a dozen families listed here,

28:28.832 --> 28:32.290
pledging their lives
and their-their children's lives.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.244
Hey, did one of you take my phone?

28:35.339 --> 28:37.876
Um... no.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.445
Maybe you dropped it yesterday
when everything was happening.

28:40.469 --> 28:44.382
No, no, I-I put it back
in my pack last night.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.304
Mine's not here either.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.104
- Did Milla come back?
- No.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.148
- Hey, do you have your phone?
- What?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.399
Shit.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.405
Where's our fucking phones?

29:07.496 --> 29:09.032
Okay, all our phones are gone.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.908
What the fuck is going on?

29:10.999 --> 29:13.536
I thought I saw somebody
outside the tent last night.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.083
- What?
- What?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.161
- When?
- In the middle of the night.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.837
Just for a second.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.644
Could have just been
shadows from the trees.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.548
Fuck!

29:22.636 --> 29:24.547
You guys, help me... help me find Milla.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.594
- Adam...
- I'm sure she's fine.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.139
You thought you saw someone
after the tree fell,

29:29.226 --> 29:32.309
and then again last night,
and now our fucking phones are gone.

29:32.396 --> 29:35.012
They're probably fucking
watching us right now!

29:35.107 --> 29:38.474
No, no, no, no, I promised her
that I wouldn't fucking leave her again.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.933
I fucking promised her that.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.438
Hey, Adam! Adam!

29:41.530 --> 29:43.361
Milla!

29:44.783 --> 29:47.069
Milla!

29:47.160 --> 29:49.321
- Milla!
- Milla!

29:49.413 --> 29:50.949
Milla!

29:52.541 --> 29:53.701
Milla?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.908
- Milla!
- Milla!

29:57.337 --> 29:58.747
Milla!

30:00.090 --> 30:01.250
Milla!

30:01.341 --> 30:02.501
Hey.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.548
Milla!

30:05.887 --> 30:08.503
- What are you doing out here?
- Milla!

30:10.600 --> 30:11.806
Who's that?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.642
I saw her in town.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.345
I think her name's ruthie.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.146
In town?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.439
Hey!

30:19.526 --> 30:21.642
Hey. Sorry.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.617
Come here.
Why don't you come here for a second.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.133
- Adam.
- I just wanna ask you something.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.866
No, you see this girl, and now she's here
out of fucking nowhere, and Milla's gone?

30:28.952 --> 30:30.388
You think that this is a coincidence?

30:30.412 --> 30:32.152
- No fucking way.
- Calm down.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.309
I fucking warned you
about these white-trash hillbillies.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.994
- Hey!
- Adam! Stop!

30:36.084 --> 30:37.369
Get over here!

30:37.461 --> 30:39.042
Hey! Hey!

30:41.006 --> 30:42.746
Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.213
Adam.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.244
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't let her get away!

30:53.268 --> 30:55.509
- Dar, go on after her!
- No, wait!

30:55.604 --> 30:57.811
What?

30:57.898 --> 31:00.105
Guys? Guys, what is that?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.478
My foot's caught on something.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.729
What the hell is that?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.856
Guys! Whoa!

31:05.947 --> 31:07.357
What the hell is this?

31:07.449 --> 31:10.031
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Darius!

31:10.118 --> 31:12.825
- What's going on? Guys?
- Darius, help!

31:12.913 --> 31:14.073
What? What?

31:19.044 --> 31:20.830
Adam! Oh, my god!

31:22.506 --> 31:24.292
No, no, no, no, no, no!

31:24.383 --> 31:25.668
Adam?

31:25.759 --> 31:27.249
Can you hear me?

31:27.344 --> 31:29.175
- Adam!
- Do you see him?

31:29.262 --> 31:30.877
No.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.088
Uh, I-I feel a draft.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.639
Luis, grab my legs.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.136
Lower me in, okay?

31:37.979 --> 31:39.389
Adam!

31:39.481 --> 31:41.062
Adam...

31:43.402 --> 31:44.767
Adam.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.027
Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit!

31:49.616 --> 31:52.198
Darius, this is crazy. We need help.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.930
Look, if I can get that snake
out of there,

31:53.954 --> 31:55.640
- maybe I can reach Adam, okay.
- And do what?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.701
He's still caught on that chain.
What if he's hurt?

31:58.792 --> 32:01.408
Maybe this hole connects
to an old mine or something.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.022
We can look for an entrance, and then...

32:03.046 --> 32:06.413
Okay, how long do you want to look?
An hour? Two? All day?

32:06.508 --> 32:07.748
That chain goes somewhere!

32:07.843 --> 32:10.630
I know! Somebody put it there.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.381
Do you hear what I'm saying?

32:12.472 --> 32:15.509
We need to get the fuck
off this mountain and get help.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.591
No phones. No GPS.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.519
How are we supposed to find
our way back here, huh?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.687
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.560
Let's go.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.758
What is this place?

33:00.770 --> 33:03.307
Looks like a lost and found
for the whole mountain.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.525
I think maybe Adam
was right about these people.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.110
We should go.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.665
Guys, guys, shh.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.919
Is that them?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.422
- Those hunters from town?
- I don't know.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.969
Can't...

33:37.557 --> 33:39.218
That's Adam.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.720
That's Adam.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.938
Darius, no.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.855
Hey, hey. Put him down right now.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.407
Put him the fuck down!

34:03.083 --> 34:04.643
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't understand.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.827
Speak english.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.081
- Oh, my god, Adam.
- Is he dead?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.712
Hey, where's our friend?

34:14.803 --> 34:16.447
Where's our friend?
Did you take her? Did you?

34:16.471 --> 34:18.462
Did you kill her? Answer me!

34:18.556 --> 34:21.172
- Where is she? What'd you do?
- Did you fucking take her? Hey!

34:21.268 --> 34:22.724
I will fucking kill you! Back up!

34:22.811 --> 34:25.143
Get the fuck back!

34:25.230 --> 34:27.471
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

34:27.565 --> 34:29.022
Where is she? Where the fuck is she?

34:29.109 --> 34:31.545
I can't fucking understand you.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.060
Speak english! Speak english!

34:50.338 --> 34:55.297
You killed her! You killed her!
You killed her!

34:57.554 --> 34:59.419
- Adam! Adam!
- You killed her!

34:59.514 --> 35:01.470
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Adam, Adam.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.261
Adam, Adam, Adam. Shit.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.313
Shit.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.687
- Where's the other one?
- Oh, shit.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.524
He's gone.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.859
Oh, my god.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.661
I had to.

35:25.749 --> 35:26.909
They...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.286
They killed Milla. They...

35:29.377 --> 35:31.083
They killed her.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.787
Adam.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.043
- Adam.
- Oh, my god.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.874
What happened to you guys?

35:37.969 --> 35:40.085
What the hell's going on here?
What's going...?

35:40.180 --> 35:42.887
What is that?
What the fuck is going on?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.339
Fuck.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.552
What the fuck is that, guys?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.345
What happened?

35:51.566 --> 35:52.772
You're alive.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.395
Yes. I'm alive. What is this?

35:54.486 --> 35:55.942
Where have you been?

35:56.029 --> 35:58.236
I left to go pee. I was in the woods.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.235
I saw these two huge guys.
They were... they were dressed like this.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.816
So I hid in the bush.

36:02.911 --> 36:05.448
We went looking for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

36:05.538 --> 36:07.600
Yeah, but I couldn't answer back,
or else they'd hear me.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.081
By the time they left, you had all gone.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.454
- Babe, what happened to you?
- I thought you were dead.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.145
Milla, we thought that they'd taken you,

36:14.214 --> 36:17.547
or-or-or killed you or something.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.421
Did you just kill this man for no reason?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.468
No-no reason?

36:22.555 --> 36:24.841
They dragged me into a fucking hole,

36:24.933 --> 36:26.924
trussed me up
like a goddamn Christmas Turkey.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.054
Who knows what they were
going to do to me?

36:29.145 --> 36:31.727
All we know for sure
is that you just killed someone.

36:31.815 --> 36:35.433
They were going to kill me, okay?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.813
Look at him. He's a...
He's a fucking animal.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.644
He's right. Listen, listen.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.051
There's one fucking dead guy
on the ground, the other one left.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.511
We don't know how many more there are.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.242
We have to get the fuck
off of this mountain, right?

36:46.329 --> 36:47.660
What about the body?

36:47.747 --> 36:49.738
Yeah, what about it?
I mean, we left Gary.

36:49.833 --> 36:52.996
Yeah. When we get back to town,
we'll let the fucking police

36:53.086 --> 36:55.418
- handle this shit.
- No, fuck that.

36:55.797 --> 37:00.006
No way. I-i-l am not turning myself over
to some redneck judge.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.049
No, fuck that.
We-we-we were never here.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.093
We were never here.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.671
So we just walk away from this?

37:06.766 --> 37:08.427
Yes.

37:08.518 --> 37:10.679
What about the other one”? He saw us.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.056
Oh, the other one.
The really friendly-looking one

37:13.148 --> 37:15.730
with the skull mask
that was... that was speaking tongues?

37:15.817 --> 37:17.978
Yeah, I'm sure he's a regular
at city council meetings.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.423
- Dude, listen. Hey, hey, listen.
- They were gonna kill me!

37:20.447 --> 37:22.049
Listen, okay, I get it.
They didn't kill Milla.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.782
But the-the-the snare trap
and the lumber mill, right?

37:25.869 --> 37:28.406
- And Adam tied to a fucking log?
- Yes, yes.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.908
I mean, who fucking knows?
They probably killed Gary.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.957
Like, these are clearly not good people.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.077
We got to get the fuck out of here, guys.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.915
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.545
Come on.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.284
We're still headed east.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.799
Once we find a stream,
we can follow it down the mountain.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.509
Why don't we just go straight down?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.457
You want to take a header off a cliff?
Be my guest.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.584
Okay, you don't have to be
a fucking bitch about it. I get it.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.461
It's my fault. I should've
announced I was leaving to go pee.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.567
- It's okay. Forget it.
- Fuck.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.715
We should've grabbed some
of that climbing gear we saw.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.230
No, it's good we didn't touch
anything, right? No traces?

38:05.325 --> 38:07.261
If we've done nothing wrong,
we have nothing to hide.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.198
Jesus, fucking quit it
with the morality police bullshit, Jen.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.689
You're clueless about what you want

38:12.749 --> 38:15.035
for your own blessed
all-American white girl life,

38:15.126 --> 38:17.229
and yet you know exactly
what's right for everybody else?

38:17.253 --> 38:18.773
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Really?

38:18.838 --> 38:20.608
Do we honestly not know
what's right and wrong here?

38:20.632 --> 38:23.669
What's right for you
has nothing to do with anyone else.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.250
What's right should be right, period.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.363
- Look...
- It's not for you to say.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.252
The guy's dead. It's over.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.634
We're not talking about it
to anybody, all right?

38:30.725 --> 38:31.760
Whatever.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.092
Hey, how about we all
just shut up and relax?

38:34.187 --> 38:35.667
Let's see if we can make that happen.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.311
Fuck.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.059
Jesus Christ.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.858
Oh, my god! Darius!

38:52.163 --> 38:53.778
Are you okay? Are you okay?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.704
Another fucking trap.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.037
Still think these people aren't monsters?

39:01.214 --> 39:03.830
Ooh, okay. It's not that bad.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.319
You're lucky you didn't tear an artery.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.958
Where'd it come from?

39:07.053 --> 39:09.510
Must've stepped on something
to trigger it.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.212
Fuck this place.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.808
Thanks... again.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.766
You're welcome. Again.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.439
Good as new.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.489
Let's go.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.640
Luis?

40:05.528 --> 40:07.314
Where is he?

40:07.614 --> 40:09.605
- Luis?
- Luis?

40:10.491 --> 40:11.901
Oh, my god.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.154
- Luis?
- Luis?

40:15.371 --> 40:17.202
Luis?

40:21.252 --> 40:22.252
Guys?

40:24.797 --> 40:26.287
Oh, god, it's them.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.665
It's them.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.466
Dude, there's nobody there.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.551
Guys, it's them.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.381
- There's nobody there, man. Relax. Relax.
- Guys?

40:35.475 --> 40:38.433
No, it's fucking them!
We have to go right now. We have to go!

40:38.728 --> 40:41.014
- Adam!
- Wait, no, Milla.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.684
Oh, shit.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.362
Run. Run!

40:57.413 --> 40:59.074
- Run, run, run.
- Adam!

40:59.165 --> 41:01.156
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.621
Adam!

41:11.344 --> 41:12.709
Milla!

41:13.262 --> 41:15.594
Oh, shit.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.593
- Adam, help me.
- Milla.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.924
Holy shit.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.758
Milla.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.220
- Get me out of here.
- Oh, my god.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.101
Uh, okay.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.604
- Help.
- Oh, shit.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.609
Milla.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.281
Hurry.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.450
Shit. Shit.

41:37.537 --> 41:38.902
Fuck.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.703
- I'll be right back.
- No, don't.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.702
I'm gonna get some help.
I'll be right back.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.813
- No, you can't do this again!
- I'm just going to go get help.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.023
- I'm going to be back, okay?
- Don't leave me! Look at me!

41:48.047 --> 41:49.253
Fucking look at me!

41:49.340 --> 41:52.377
- Fuck.
- No! Fuck you!

41:54.721 --> 41:58.885
You promised me you would never leave me.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.358
Help me.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.195
Help me.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.489
Help me.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.152
Come on, let's go.

43:58.219 --> 43:59.504
What the fuck was that?

43:59.595 --> 44:01.051
- Ah!
- Darius!

44:01.139 --> 44:03.346
Darius! Darius!

44:03.432 --> 44:05.514
Darius?

44:27.456 --> 44:28.536
Good morning.

44:28.624 --> 44:30.740
You're late. And you're carpool today.

44:30.835 --> 44:31.835
- I know.
- I have class.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.750
I got a meeting in saddle river
with a roofer

44:33.838 --> 44:35.065
and a concrete guy in millburn.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.777
- You haven't heard from Jen, have you?
- Why would she call me?

44:38.801 --> 44:40.587
- Because you're her mom.
- Don't say "mom."

44:40.678 --> 44:44.546
She hates that. Get your stuff.
You have one minute.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.176
Jenny, it's your dad.

44:46.267 --> 44:50.180
I'm, uh, just calling again
to see how you're doing.

44:50.271 --> 44:53.058
I hope you're having fun
with your friends.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.898
Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about that offer.

44:55.985 --> 44:57.713
You'd get your own office
and your own coffee maker

44:57.737 --> 44:58.943
with all the perks.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.816
Excuse the pun.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.488
Anyhow...

45:03.743 --> 45:05.574
Don't forget to call me, all right?

45:05.661 --> 45:07.993
It's been a couple weeks now, and...

45:08.080 --> 45:10.366
I'd love to hear your voice.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.164
Please, give me a call.

45:12.251 --> 45:15.539
Thank you. I love you. Bye.

45:18.591 --> 45:19.751
Weird.

45:19.842 --> 45:21.048
It went to voicemail again.

45:22.511 --> 45:24.502
Want to know why she doesn't call?

45:24.597 --> 45:26.212
Jennifer went off to find herself,

45:26.307 --> 45:29.049
which is a choice she made
to avoid making a choice.

45:29.143 --> 45:33.603
Look, how about you focus
on my boys, our boys?

45:33.689 --> 45:35.225
For once.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.977
- Yeah.
- Please?

46:28.494 --> 46:29.859
Help!

46:31.497 --> 46:33.988
Help! Somebody, please!

46:34.542 --> 46:36.157
Help me!

46:39.005 --> 46:41.291
Stop your screaming,
or you'll suffer for it.

46:41.382 --> 46:43.088
You. I know you.

46:43.175 --> 46:45.006
Help me. Please help me.

46:45.094 --> 46:46.880
Do you want food? Water?

46:46.971 --> 46:48.586
- Yes.
- Then shut your mouth.

46:48.681 --> 46:49.966
Understand?

46:50.057 --> 46:51.513
Please, please, please, let me go.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.682
Please. You met me in town, remember?

46:53.769 --> 46:57.182
- You and the little girl? Ruthie?
- You don't want to listen.

46:57.273 --> 46:59.935
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm sorry!

47:00.026 --> 47:01.482
I'm sorry. Please.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.434
Please, please come back.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.899
Please!

47:11.329 --> 47:13.285
This isn't happening.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.244
This isn't happening!

48:07.093 --> 48:08.754
Milla?

48:19.355 --> 48:21.016
Walk.

49:31.177 --> 49:33.133
What the. .?

49:37.016 --> 49:38.381
Walk.

50:10.716 --> 50:12.252
Kneel.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.923
I'm done with this bullshit.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.380
Kneel.

50:19.934 --> 50:21.265
Fuck you.

50:26.065 --> 50:27.896
Jesus. They'll kill you, man.

50:29.151 --> 50:30.516
Stay down.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.269
Stay back.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.570
Oh, god.

51:24.665 --> 51:26.781
This is court.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.615
You are on trial.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.660
Trial? For what?

51:31.755 --> 51:33.336
Murder.

51:33.424 --> 51:36.211
This is bullshit!
We didn't murder anybody!

51:39.096 --> 51:40.586
Only you will speak.

51:42.224 --> 51:45.466
If you have questions,
my daughter will answer.

52:04.371 --> 52:07.829
You-you can't put us on trial.
This-this isn't a court of law.

52:07.916 --> 52:10.498
The law is the law.

52:10.586 --> 52:12.167
There's only truth and lies.

52:12.254 --> 52:16.748
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

52:16.842 --> 52:18.423
It's fucking insane!

52:20.804 --> 52:24.296
The next one who speaks
out of turn loses their tongue.

52:29.730 --> 52:31.186
Hobbs.

52:35.235 --> 52:39.945
I saw each of them,
in town and on the mountain.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.697
That one threw a bottle at me.

52:45.788 --> 52:48.029
- No, no.
- Jesus, Adam.

52:48.123 --> 52:51.581
He says vile words about us.

52:52.711 --> 52:54.497
He hates us.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.351
Morgan.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.222
Morgan...

53:15.317 --> 53:17.308
Tell us what you saw.

53:27.371 --> 53:28.861
Samuel...

53:32.459 --> 53:34.825
W-w-what is he saying?

53:36.964 --> 53:41.298
"My brother, Samuel,
and I were out hunting."

53:45.973 --> 53:49.932
"Stalking moose and elk
for the winter larder."

53:52.479 --> 53:58.520
"We were checking our game traps
in the cave where caught game is dragged

53:58.610 --> 54:00.726
to keep predators from getting to it."

54:02.573 --> 54:03.938
- Ah!
- Adam!

54:06.326 --> 54:10.911
"And we found
this stranger instead."

54:14.460 --> 54:19.454
"He was hurt, knocked out.
We were taking him down the mountain."

54:24.011 --> 54:26.593
"Planned to leave him
where he'd be found..."

54:34.313 --> 54:37.680
"When these others attacked us."

54:45.991 --> 54:49.575
"He killed my brother Samuel."

54:49.661 --> 54:51.652
No. We didn't know.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.367
They were wearing skulls,

54:54.458 --> 54:57.040
and their bodies were covered
with leaves and blood.

54:58.170 --> 55:01.253
What we wear when we go hunting, huh?

55:01.340 --> 55:05.049
To hide our scent and our faces
from our prey.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.841
Your hunters do the same.

55:06.929 --> 55:08.715
Hmm?

55:08.889 --> 55:12.052
Did he do what Morgan has accused?

55:12.142 --> 55:17.057
Did this man murder
Morgan's brother, Samuel?

55:18.649 --> 55:23.518
Lie, and dread will fall on each of you.

55:25.030 --> 55:26.645
I warn you.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.231
Speak true.

55:36.792 --> 55:37.952
No.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.623
He didn't murder him.

56:01.275 --> 56:02.606
Ruthie.

56:09.783 --> 56:13.275
Ruthie, who killed Samuel?

56:18.417 --> 56:20.499
You lied to this court.

56:21.670 --> 56:23.160
No, no.

56:23.255 --> 56:24.745
Adam feared for his life.

56:24.840 --> 56:27.172
He killed this man in self-defense.

56:27.259 --> 56:28.544
It's not murder.

56:28.635 --> 56:30.717
We thought they were kidnapping him.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.965
We thought they were taking him
somewhere to kill him.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.422
Why? Why did you think this?

56:35.517 --> 56:38.304
What proof did you have?

56:38.395 --> 56:41.182
Had you met any of our people?

56:41.940 --> 56:45.148
Had we caused you any harm?!

56:57.956 --> 57:01.448
This court finds you guilty of murder.

57:02.586 --> 57:04.793
- The sentence is death.
- What?

57:04.880 --> 57:07.496
No, no, no, I didn't...
It was a mistake.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.331
I didn't know what they were doing.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.587
It's not my fault!

57:14.806 --> 57:16.137
Gget back.

57:16.224 --> 57:18.135
You want this kid to join your brother?

57:18.226 --> 57:20.342
Then back the fuck off!

57:20.437 --> 57:21.847
Adam, Adam, no.

57:21.939 --> 57:24.476
- Shut up.
- Hey, hey, Adam.

57:24.566 --> 57:27.729
If you hurt her, you make things
worse for all of us.

57:27.819 --> 57:31.983
Look around, dar.
This shit's already worse.

57:32.074 --> 57:34.156
Okay, this is what you're gonna do.

57:34.242 --> 57:40.078
You're going to untie my friends,
and then you're going to let us go.

57:40.165 --> 57:43.032
I'm not afraid of you!

57:43.126 --> 57:46.243
I just want to get as far away
from you backwoods fucks

57:46.338 --> 57:47.544
as I possibly can.

57:48.507 --> 57:49.667
Now, move.

57:49.758 --> 57:51.840
I look in your eyes.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.339
I see only fear.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.676
There's no future for men like you.

58:00.394 --> 58:01.634
Fuck you!

58:04.481 --> 58:07.063
I was wrong to call you a man.

58:09.778 --> 58:13.441
The rest of you are guilty
for bearing false witness.

58:13.532 --> 58:15.113
The sentence is darkness.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.986
What? No, no, no. Please, please.

58:17.077 --> 58:19.443
- Take them.
- Please, please, no.

58:19.538 --> 58:21.369
Please, no! No!

58:24.376 --> 58:25.912
Jen! Jen!

58:29.381 --> 58:30.746
Jen!

58:56.908 --> 59:01.368
This family is owed retribution.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.741
How was Samuel murdered?

59:03.832 --> 59:07.040
Say the words.

59:07.127 --> 59:10.244
How was Samuel murdered?

59:18.930 --> 59:20.841
He was struck in the head.

59:32.444 --> 59:33.729
With this.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.485
No, no, no, no, no.

59:39.576 --> 59:40.691
No, don't do this.

59:40.786 --> 59:42.947
Don't do this, please.

59:43.038 --> 59:45.450
Please. It's wrong.

59:45.540 --> 59:47.246
It's barbaric.

59:47.334 --> 59:48.790
Listen to me, listen to me.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.788
We can help you.

59:51.671 --> 59:52.911
We'll do anything.

59:53.006 --> 59:55.122
- We can get you money...
- Barbaric?

59:55.217 --> 59:56.707
Hmm?

59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.093
Our families built this place.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.217
Men and women of all races and creeds

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:08.928
came here to avoid the armageddon
they knew was coming between the states.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.934
We have everything we need.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:17.190
Everyone works.
Everyone contributes.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.067
Our food is fresh and plentiful.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:24.527
We have no cancer, no poverty, no war.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:29.240
No one hates another
because they have while another doesn't.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:33.543
We are one body working together.

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:45.385
You tell me, whose world is more barbaric?

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.772
Nol

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:07.778
Take them.

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:25.296
Your sentence is darkness.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:29.178
Here, you will see no evil,

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:32.386
hear no evil, speak no evil.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.606
No!

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:45.197
Oh, no!

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.991
No, wait. Please, no.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.363
Jen!

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.241
No! No!

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:58.002
Ah! Don't!

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.875
Darius! Darius, help me!

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:01.922
I'm s 0 ry! I'm s 0 ry

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.717
no! Help me! No! Please!

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:05.990
Please, dear god. Please don't.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:08.005
No! No!

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.068
Fuck off.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:37.704
Listen to me.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.752
You're making a mistake.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.171
You're wasting valuable resources...

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.756
What are we wasting?

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.256
Us.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.758
Us. Us.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.555
You-you have us.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:52.928
Use us.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.759
Darius works in nonprofit.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.687
- He works in sustainable energy.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.483
He's designed homes, neighborhoods,
communities to be self-sufficient.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.025
We're already self-sufficient.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.071
No, but you need maintenance,
improvements.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.819
You suffer storm damage, climate changes.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.401
Springs dry up. You need problems solved.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:12.906
That's what he does.

01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:15.867
That's his skill.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.449
That's what he can contribute.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:20.786
You do this, you lose all of that.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.043
Standard says you're strong.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.749
You have a warrior spirit.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.960
I don't give up.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:32.805
And what of you?

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.974
What do you offer?

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:43.266
Myself.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.107
There's no sickness in my family.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:53.197
No cancer.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:58.407
I'm young, healthy.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.627
I'll have strong, healthy children.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.092
Who among your men needs a wife?

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:17.053
No.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:26.438
Open your mouth.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.734
Shut up.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:38.571
Spread your legs.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:42.287
Spread your legs.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.085
Edith.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:08.231
Are you prepared to become
a loyal citizen?

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.399
Yes.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:19.821
Are you prepared to become
a loyal citizen?

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.622
Yes.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:29.298
If you run, you should know
there's no safe way off this mountain.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:33.631
If our traps don't kill you,
the animals will.

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:38.010
If the land doesn't kill you,
our people will.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:43.016
If you don't contribute...
You'll end up here.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.556
Do you understand?

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:51.227
Yes.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.071
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.635
Please don't hate me.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.777
Vee nor.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:48.876
Vee nor.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.088
Vee nor what...?

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.252
"Friends?"

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.834
Does that mean "friends?"

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.638
Come with me.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:08:00.486
I've had no wife for a year.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:10.117
She died in a fall.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:17.173
Here, people die
of either accidents or old age.

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.008
Can we ever leave?

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.595
Why would you want to?

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.524
I know about life below.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.198
You're alone.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:52.455
People come to the mountains
looking for something.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:57.960
Something to remind them
that life is worth living.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.763
You came looking for something.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:12.890
And now you've found it.

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:35.663
You're not as strong as you pretend to be.

01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:06.945
Hey, it's Jen.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.742
Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:10.491
Thanks. Bye.

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.446
The mailbox is full

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:14.622
and cannot accept any messages
at this time. Goodbye.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.002
Hi.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.547
No. I don't know.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.215
Maybe a couple more days.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:26.635
I'm waiting to hear back
from the local police before I move on.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.802
I know.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.679
She's, uh... she's missing.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.413
Hello.

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.829
I'm sorry about your daughter
and her friends.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.582
- Double whiskey.
- Thank you.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.503
I told her to stay on the trail.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.886
There are people living on that mountain.

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.886
What people?

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:17.849
The foundation.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.856
The foundation?

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:24.356
It's a story people here know
but don't talk about,

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.233
except in whispers.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.860
Like a ghost story.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.156
On.

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:34.738
In 1859, a dozen or so families
packed up and fled up the mountain.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:39.201
They feared the collapse of America,
and wanted to protect their way of life.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.581
They said when America fell,

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:47.167
they would be the foundation
on which a new nation would be built.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:52.342
And these descendants of these people

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.017
are still living up there on the mountain?

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.594
We don't bother them,
and they don't bother us.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:04.309
But anyone who goes up there,
they don't come back...

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.689
Alive or dead.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.857
And you know this how?

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:13.364
It's happened before.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:14.910
But if it's happened before,

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.704
why hasn't someone
done something about it?

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.082
Because...

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.753
It's made to look like they left.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.668
I'm sorry.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.778
You just don't listen, do you, mister?

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:08.506
Your girl is dead,
and you don't want to find what's left.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.504
She's not dead.

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:14.508
Oh, you son of a...

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.806
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.014
Hey.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:25.598
Hey!

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.526
No, no, no.

01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:30.023
No! No!

01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:31.903
- Get him up.
- Hey!

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.903
You son of a bitch.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.680
Oh, shit.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:08.228
What are you doing?

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:09.980
What does it look like I'm doing?

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:11.602
You don't want to go up there.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.313
She's my daughter. I'm gonna find her.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:15.272
Scott...

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.575
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.368
Jesus. What happened?

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:23.540
Whatever happened to you
is nothing compared to what they'll do.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.784
Wait.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.876
I could help you.

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:49.435
This him?

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.063
Yes.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.609
Ed, this is Mr. Shaw.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.113
Ed's my nephew. He's a hunter.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.031
You get in a car wreck or something?

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:00.071
Or something.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.823
You got the money?

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.164
Five thousand.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.795
Okay.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.403
We'll see you in the morning, then.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.917
No, no.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.627
We go now.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.884
You got gear?

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:23.842
Can't go up there
dressed for no ladies' tea.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.472
You need glasses?

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:27.929
Backpack, sleeping bag, poles.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.810
Okay, okay, okay. Coop.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.357
Toss me my go bag.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:36.358
I got everything you need in there.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:39.065
Why don't you go and take that
yellow jacket off your back.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.276
Look like a fucking bull's-eye
walking around.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.735
Give the keys to Aileen.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.411
She'll park your car outside the inn,

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.830
make it look like
you been there all night.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.873
Hey, let me ask you a question.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.326
Why'd you agree to do this?

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:52.252
Money.

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:55.046
Got a son here I want to send
through welding school,

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:59.218
and I ain't got no love
for them foundation fuckers.

01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:02.463
Arrow did that.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.970
Nineteen stitches.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:08.645
A warning shot across the old brain pan
to keep off of their mountain.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.771
Wouldn't mind returning the favor.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.077
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay back.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:37.085
Stake trap.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.633
Sneaky motherfuckers.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.506
Gget out of the creek.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:51.099
These foundation folks
like to set traps like these

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.021
to drive strangers up off the mountain.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:57.603
There's a second set further up
where I got my trophy.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.187
What comes after the second set?

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.861
Strangers don't get to leave.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.443
You walk where I walk.

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:14.744
Jesus.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.249
How much further?

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.047
There's a steep trail up along this Ridge.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.968
I won't lie, though.
It's a bitch of a hike.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.545
But it shortcuts us right up
to the bastards' front door.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.007
Cooper! Cooper!

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.888
Cooper, you hurt?

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.560
Are you all right?

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:32.978
I think I twisted my ankle.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.101
Christ. Come on, help me pull him out.

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.148
Okay, give me your hand.

01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:44.528
Give me your other hand.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:57.870
Come on. Come on.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.047
Come on.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.307
What?

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:27.699
Cooper?

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.656
Jesus.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.574
One step at a time.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:34.910
Darius?

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.238
Uh, it's me.

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:42.618
Where's Jen?

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.747
What's happened to you?

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:54.679
What the fuck is happening?

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.017
Where's my daughter?

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:01.637
Stay back.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.822
What's wrong with you people?

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:39.049
Jen?

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:42.727
Jen.

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.769
What have they done to you?

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.735
What have you done to my daughter?

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:09.547
Whoever you are...
This woman is not your daughter.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:12.340
She's my wife.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.259
What are you talking about?

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.012
What the fuck is that?

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.311
No trial is necessary.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:27.310
We find this stranger guilty
of trespassing.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:30.893
The sentence is darkness,
to be carried out at dawn.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.774
What are you saying?

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.480
Hey... ah!

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.692
You won't get away with this.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.618
People will come for me.

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.037
They know where I am!

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.581
No. No one will ever come.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.374
Jennifer!

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:57.381
Are you all right?

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.589
I'm fine.

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:01.298
Why?

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:05.511
That man is your father.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.491
I've made my choice.

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:55.686
- Jen.
- Shh.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.485
We don't have much time.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:01.567
You found your way up here.
Do you know a safe way back?

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.452
Okay.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.201
Let's go.

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.960
You shot me with an arrow.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.004
They would've killed us both.

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:16.832
Come on, let's go.

01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:38.903
What is this?

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:40.276
Time to leave.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:42.107
Why now?

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.409
Because tomorrow morning,
they're gonna kill my dad.

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:46.323
We need to go.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.121
Come on.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:49.744
I'm not going.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.835
What?

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.787
These people see me.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.998
I belong to them.

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:01.551
They belong to me.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.504
(50.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.512
I won't stop you.

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.822
Do you really think you can
go back to your old life?

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.624
Stay close.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:50.013
This gate's never locked like this.

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.144
Jen.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:02.062
Ruthie.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.739
I have to go.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.282
Do you understand?

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:11.284
I know you like to sneak down
the mountain sometimes.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:13.115
Do you know another way out?

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.993
Through there?

01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.919
You're saying there's a way out
through there?

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:17.437
Do you want to come with me, ruthie?

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.691
You can if you want to.

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:56.722
Let's go.

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:48.960
Aw, geez.

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:52.463
I barely made it up here in the daylight.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:53.760
Shh!

01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:56.421
Did you hear that?

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:21.238
Jen!

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.995
Jen!

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:42.850
Dad.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.766
Dad.

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:51.852
Jen?

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:56.106
Jen?

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.000
I can smell your juices.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:30.224
After venable takes your eyes,
your ears, and your tongue,

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.854
I'm going to keep you for myself.

01:31:56.553 --> 01:31:57.668
Jen.

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:10.145
Jen?

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:25.203
Jen.

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.074
Jennifer.

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:41.127
All right.

01:32:47.937 --> 01:32:49.677
Hey.

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:41.024
What do we do now?

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:45.275
All that matters now is the next choice.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:48.157
That's what I've learned on this mountain.

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:52.411
That's how I've survived.

01:34:12.105 --> 01:34:13.470
Let's go.

01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:30.077
Which way?

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:37.585
Told you I'd see you again.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.248
Back the fuck up!

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.862
Whoa, wait a minute. We're here to help.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.842
- Bullshit.
- And fuck you, too.

01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:47.716
Hey, mister, I was trying
to save your life back there.

01:34:47.807 --> 01:34:51.220
I figured a good beat down
might send your ass packing.

01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:53.051
And you.

01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:56.183
That yellow in my eyes...

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:58.731
Was my liver turning on me.

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:00.433
You were right.

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:04.187
Look, I ain't got any kids.

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:09.447
But my nephew disappeared
in these woods six years ago.

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.612
And I never found the body.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:14.743
Fucking foundation.

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:18.372
I'd like to shoot every one
of those sons of bitches.

01:35:19.964 --> 01:35:21.704
Where's your friends?

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:24.378
It's just us.

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:31.589
Come on.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:40.731
Ah!

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:47.313
- Fuck!
- No, no, no!

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:50.195
- I'll get you.
- Where the fuck is it?

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:03.629
I think we got 'em.

01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:26.519
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:32.358
Jennifer!

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:35.161
Get in the truck.

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:36.658
Get in.

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:44.147
It's my great-uncle Willie's
special recipe.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:48.859
All right, suit yourself.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:28.183
I want to set that footing
by tomorrow evening.

01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:30.188
- Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, dad.

01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:31.894
I brought you the revised blueprints

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:33.801
- for the north Caldwell house.
- Oh, you're kidding.

01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:35.761
You didn't need to bring them
all the way down here.

01:38:35.785 --> 01:38:37.425
I know you wanted to see them right away.

01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:40.362
I also know you're gonna hate
the new master bath.

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:42.117
Well, you did warn me.

01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:43.288
Mm-hm.

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:46.834
What?

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.128
Nothing. I'm just proud of you.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:51.960
Thanks, dad.

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:55.426
Come on.

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:00.423
I love you.

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:02.304
I love you, too.

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.565
Well, good night.

01:39:09.652 --> 01:39:10.983
I'll see you at home.

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.274
Oh, and remember,
it's pizza and movie night,

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:15.855
so don't be late.

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:19.408
The boys picked something
with inbred cannibals?

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:20.905
Again?

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.413
Geez.

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:49.639
It's a privacy screen.

01:39:49.734 --> 01:39:51.065
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:52.392
You can't see it from the side.

01:39:52.445 --> 01:39:54.026
All right, here we go.

01:39:54.113 --> 01:39:55.478
Oh, hi, hon.

01:39:55.573 --> 01:39:59.361
Uh, meet our new neighbors,
John and ruthie.

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:02.239
They're looking at the kaplan
house down the street.

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:03.820
Nothing is set in stone yet.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:06.281
Well, it turns out John knows Scott.

01:40:06.375 --> 01:40:08.832
Our paths crossed.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:13.334
Said if I was ever in the neighborhood
to stop by and meet the family.

01:40:14.634 --> 01:40:16.124
Small world, right?

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:19.210
Yes. Very.

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:24.132
Are you going to put those groceries down?

01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:27.302
Corinne...

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:29.933
This coffee is wonderful, thank you.

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.061
Uh, can you stay for dinner?

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:35.768
I'm sure Scott would love to see you.

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.104
We're having pizza.

01:40:38.199 --> 01:40:40.030
Yes.

01:40:41.536 --> 01:40:43.072
We would love to stay.

01:40:43.162 --> 01:40:45.198
It's been a long drive.

01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:49.536
- Thank you.
- Oh, be right back.

01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:54.120
And I see you're eating for two.

01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:58.298
Congratulations.

01:40:58.386 --> 01:41:00.172
I need to use the bathroom.

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:28.033
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Jen!

01:41:28.124 --> 01:41:31.241
Put your weapon down,
or I kill your family.

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.541
I was wrong about you, Jen.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:39.335
You are strong.

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:42.260
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:44.132
Now it's time to come home.

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.384
What's the point? You have to kill me.

01:41:46.475 --> 01:41:47.475
Yes.

01:41:48.477 --> 01:41:51.139
But not until our child is born.

01:41:53.691 --> 01:41:56.057
Congratulations, grandma.

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:24.839
Jen...

01:42:27.433 --> 01:42:29.640
What are you doing?

01:42:30.519 --> 01:42:32.225
Jen?

01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:38.307
Mom?

01:42:39.487 --> 01:42:41.227
Can you and the boys excuse us?

01:42:41.322 --> 01:42:43.984
John's here to talk business.

01:42:44.075 --> 01:42:46.691
Of course. Come on. Laundry.

01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:50.779
Come on. You want pizza? Mush.

01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:06.631
I was wrong about you, Jen.

01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:09.134
You are strong.

01:43:09.225 --> 01:43:12.683
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:15.261
You let us make you strong.

01:43:15.356 --> 01:43:17.688
That's good.

01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:20.562
You're carrying my child, so...

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:25.317
Time to come home.

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:31.068
Promise me you won't hurt them.

01:43:34.083 --> 01:43:35.448
Fver.

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.960
You'll never come back here.

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:42.963
Promise, and I'll go with you.

01:43:44.135 --> 01:43:45.796
You have my word.

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:11.170
J this land is your land j

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:15.848
j and this land is my land j

01:45:15.935 --> 01:45:20.645
I from the California j

01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:24.940
I to the New York island &

01:45:25.027 --> 01:45:29.862
I from the redwood forest j

01:45:29.949 --> 01:45:34.158
j to the Gulf stream waters j

01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:39.455
j this land was made j

01:45:39.542 --> 01:45:41.749
j for you and me j

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:48.089
j as I went walking &

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:52.293
j that ribbon of highway j&

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:56.847
j' I saw above me j

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.599
j that endless skyway j

01:46:02.648 --> 01:46:06.186
j I saw below me j

01:46:07.111 --> 01:46:10.774
j the golden valley &

01:46:12.825 --> 01:46:16.738
j this land was made j

01:46:16.829 --> 01:46:20.321
j for you and me j

01:46:20.833 --> 01:46:24.496
I roamed and rambled j

01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:29.623
j and I've followed my footsteps I

01:46:30.342 --> 01:46:32.628
j to the sparkling sands j

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.714
I of her diamond deserts j

01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:43.052
jd all around me I

01:46:43.772 --> 01:46:49.108
j a voice was sounding j

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:53.609
j this land was made j

01:46:53.699 --> 01:46:57.362
j for you and me j

01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:01.784
j there was a big high wall there j

01:47:02.333 --> 01:47:05.917
j that tried to stop me j

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:10.496
j a sign was painted &

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:15.084
j it said "private property” &

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:20.093
j but on the back side j

01:47:21.143 --> 01:47:24.226
j it didn't say nothing j

01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:30.600
j this land was made j

01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:34.903
j for you and me j

01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:38.903
j when the sun comes shining j

01:47:38.994 --> 01:47:42.703
j then I was strolling j

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:48.334
j and the wheat fields waving j

01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:53.210
j and the dust clouds rolling j

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:57.669
j a voice was chanting j

01:47:57.763 --> 01:48:01.551
j as the fog was lifting j

01:48:03.852 --> 01:48:07.470
j this land was made j

01:48:07.564 --> 01:48:11.432
j for you and me j
