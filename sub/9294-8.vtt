00:13.290 --> 00:14.657
The FBI believes

00:14.724 --> 00:16.392
they've detected where the
next attack will take place.

00:16.460 --> 00:19.095
The chemical plant just
outside Kidron, Ohio.

00:19.163 --> 00:20.796
<i>What's our time frame?</i>

00:20.864 --> 00:22.198
The tank could rupture
in less than 15 minutes.

00:22.266 --> 00:24.067
Right now our best chance to stop this

00:24.134 --> 00:27.136
is by finding Dubaku and the CIP device.

00:27.204 --> 00:28.271
400 psi.

00:28.339 --> 00:31.040
How long before the tank ruptures?

00:31.108 --> 00:32.475
<i>Seven minutes.</i>

00:32.542 --> 00:33.977
We've got a problem.

00:34.044 --> 00:35.578
I thought you killed Almeida and Bauer.

00:35.645 --> 00:37.046
Damn it! How did they find us?!

00:37.114 --> 00:38.214
I don't know!

00:38.282 --> 00:39.415
 They're in the building.

00:39.483 --> 00:40.716
Disengage the CIP module.

00:40.784 --> 00:42.352
Begin the offload.

00:51.095 --> 00:53.162
Go!

00:53.230 --> 00:54.497
Jack, I've got the CIP device!

00:54.564 --> 00:56.199
It's been destroyed.

00:56.266 --> 00:58.501
The Matobos are safe. I'm
taking them to the van.

00:58.568 --> 00:59.835
Copy that.

00:59.903 --> 01:01.804
You and Bill do a sweep.
See if you can find Dubaku.

01:04.074 --> 01:06.009
We are not equipped to look for one man

01:06.076 --> 01:07.076
in a city of millions.

01:07.144 --> 01:08.944
We need additional resources.

01:09.013 --> 01:10.446
The government? They can't be trusted.

01:10.514 --> 01:11.614
We can't trust anybody.

01:11.681 --> 01:12.948
That's why we're working on the outside.

01:13.017 --> 01:15.751
President Taylor can be trusted.

01:17.254 --> 01:19.122
Madame President, you
need to listen to me.

01:19.189 --> 01:22.058
The people who rescued us, they
have acquired the CIP device.

01:22.126 --> 01:23.426
It's being destroyed,

01:23.494 --> 01:25.061
and your country's no longer
under immediate threat.

01:25.129 --> 01:27.063
Who are these people?

01:27.131 --> 01:28.931
I'll tell you everything in person,

01:28.999 --> 01:30.833
but I must speak to you alone.

01:30.901 --> 01:32.568
Please get Henry on the phone.

01:32.636 --> 01:33.903
Henry's unreachable.

01:36.573 --> 01:38.807
<i>I've been trying to reach Agent Gedge,</i>

01:38.875 --> 01:40.309
<i>and he hasn't picked up.</i>

01:40.377 --> 01:42.978
<i>He said he was outside
Samantha Roth's apartment</i>

01:43.047 --> 01:45.281
<i>waiting for the First Gentleman.</i>

01:45.349 --> 01:48.051
<i>You're telling me my
husband's gone missing?</i>

01:50.854 --> 01:51.954
<i>Gedge is dead.</i>

01:52.022 --> 01:53.122
What happened?

01:53.190 --> 01:54.457
Something went wrong.
Taylor killed Gedge,

01:54.525 --> 01:55.791
I don't know how.

01:55.859 --> 01:57.126
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

01:57.194 --> 01:58.627
Bring him to me.

02:15.745 --> 02:17.180
You're certain you weren't followed?

02:17.247 --> 02:19.549
Yes. Come on. Help me get him inside.

02:31.695 --> 02:33.296
We can confirm at this point

02:33.363 --> 02:36.399
the tragedies that unfolded
in the skies over Washington

02:36.467 --> 02:40.035
and in Kidron, Ohio, were
indeed acts of terrorism.

02:40.104 --> 02:44.140
But I am here to assure
you that those responsible

02:44.208 --> 02:47.210
are no longer a threat to this country.

02:47.277 --> 02:50.012
Their attempts to stop
us from intervening

02:50.080 --> 02:52.815
in the Sangalan genocide have failed.

02:52.882 --> 02:57.720
We will not give in to terrorists.

02:57.787 --> 03:00.156
A short time ago, I gave the order

03:00.224 --> 03:01.790
for our troops to begin operations

03:01.858 --> 03:04.059
that will liberate
the people of Sangala.

03:04.128 --> 03:08.331
We are confident that the Juma
regime will collapse swiftly,

03:08.398 --> 03:11.300
and that democracy will be restored

03:11.368 --> 03:12.435
under the leadership

03:12.503 --> 03:15.404
of Prime Minister Ule Motobo.

03:46.436 --> 03:49.238
You, you, come.

03:56.547 --> 03:58.714
Well done, Agent Vossler.

03:58.782 --> 04:00.249
I've got to go now.

04:00.317 --> 04:02.885
I've got a shift that starts at 4:00.

04:02.952 --> 04:06.355
Then go. Your money will be
wired to the usual account.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.928
The room is soundproof, Mr. Taylor.

04:12.996 --> 04:17.166
There's no point in screaming
or trying to call for help.

04:17.233 --> 04:20.101
Elimu, remove Mr. Taylor's gag.

04:23.073 --> 04:24.440
You son of a bitch.

04:24.508 --> 04:27.042
You're behind my son's death.

04:27.110 --> 04:29.645
He was poking his nose
where it did not belong.

04:29.713 --> 04:31.480
You'll never get away with
this. You must know that.

04:31.548 --> 04:33.216
Everyone in the city is
going be looking for me.

04:33.283 --> 04:37.019
You should be concerned with
just one question, Mr. Taylor.

04:39.456 --> 04:40.956
Does your wife love you enough

04:41.024 --> 04:44.327
to call off the invasion of my country?

04:44.394 --> 04:47.463
For your sake,

04:47.531 --> 04:50.366
I hope the answer is yes.

04:51.635 --> 04:55.238
Activate the scrambling device.

05:00.644 --> 05:02.745
Our law enforcement agencies

05:02.812 --> 05:05.281
will hunt down the people responsible

05:05.349 --> 05:07.416
and bring them to justice.

05:07.484 --> 05:11.487
I ask now that your thoughts and prayers

05:11.555 --> 05:14.056
go to those who lost their lives today,

05:14.124 --> 05:17.059
to their families and loved ones,

05:17.127 --> 05:20.195
and to our troops who
are putting their lives

05:20.264 --> 05:23.266
on the line in the name of freedom.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.901
Thank you.

05:25.969 --> 05:27.637
Good afternoon.

05:31.074 --> 05:33.242
Motobo's arrived.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.544
He and the others have
been brought in secretly

05:35.612 --> 05:37.280
through the underground entrance

05:37.347 --> 05:40.283
by agents I personally know and trust.

05:40.350 --> 05:42.151
Motobo told me the
people he's bringing in

05:42.218 --> 05:44.186
are responsible for saving his life

05:44.254 --> 05:46.289
and recovering the CIP device.

05:46.356 --> 05:47.623
Who are they?

05:47.691 --> 05:49.725
Bill Buchanan, whom I believe you met

05:49.793 --> 05:51.627
when he headed up CTU L.A.,

05:51.695 --> 05:55.197
FBI agent named Renee Walker

05:55.265 --> 05:58.367
and Jack Bauer.

05:58.435 --> 06:01.136
Bauer...

06:01.204 --> 06:03.539
He was one of Motobo's kidnappers.

06:03.607 --> 06:04.807
Doesn't make sense.

06:04.874 --> 06:07.142
I know.

06:07.210 --> 06:10.313
Motobo asked me to listen
to what they have to say,

06:10.380 --> 06:13.683
and I'm willing to do so.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.184
Send them in.

06:18.422 --> 06:19.888
The president's ready.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.461
Ule.

06:25.529 --> 06:27.663
I can't tell you

06:27.731 --> 06:30.265
how thankful we are that
you and Alama are safe.

06:30.334 --> 06:33.636
Thank you. She's with
Mr. Buchanan's people now,

06:33.704 --> 06:35.204
recovering.

06:35.271 --> 06:36.271
That you were subjected

06:36.340 --> 06:37.973
to such an ordeal

06:38.041 --> 06:40.743
on our soil is a source
of shame both to me

06:40.811 --> 06:42.712
personally and to my country.

06:42.779 --> 06:43.912
Madame President,

06:43.980 --> 06:46.515
my chief concern is
for Sangala, not myself.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.451
May I ask what your timetable is

06:48.518 --> 06:49.918
for the invasion?

06:49.986 --> 06:51.687
I've issued the order

06:51.755 --> 06:53.756
to our military to proceed.

06:53.824 --> 06:55.791
I thank you with all my heart.

06:55.859 --> 06:58.126
You're doing my people a great service,

06:58.194 --> 07:00.796
much as these people have
done for your country.

07:00.864 --> 07:03.499
Now forgive me, Prime Minister,

07:03.567 --> 07:05.868
but I'm finding that hard to believe.

07:05.935 --> 07:08.371
I assure you, none of
this is as it seems.

07:08.438 --> 07:10.373
But they're here to explain themselves.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.376
Now, if you'll excuse
me, Madame President,

07:13.443 --> 07:14.777
I must meet with my people

07:14.845 --> 07:16.144
to discuss post-invasion plans.

07:16.212 --> 07:17.880
Of course.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.394
I want an explanation and I want it now.

07:31.461 --> 07:33.396
What the hell is going on?!

07:33.463 --> 07:35.531
Madame President,

07:35.599 --> 07:36.932
six weeks ago, Bill Buchanan discovered

07:37.000 --> 07:38.367
that key members of your government

07:38.435 --> 07:39.702
were working with General Juma

07:39.770 --> 07:41.604
and Colonel Dubaku in an effort

07:41.671 --> 07:43.238
to undermine this
nation's foreign policy...

07:43.306 --> 07:47.175
<i>your foreign policy
with regards to Sangala.</i>

07:47.243 --> 07:51.179
You realize that that is
an outrageous accusation?

07:51.247 --> 07:54.650
Yes, ma'am.

07:54.718 --> 07:56.051
Unfortunately, it's the truth.

07:56.119 --> 07:57.920
It explains why during this crisis,

07:57.987 --> 08:00.289
every effort you made
to stop Dubaku failed.

08:02.893 --> 08:05.260
Bill, why didn't you come to me?

08:05.328 --> 08:07.996
I didn't know who I could trust
or if you'd even believe me.

08:08.064 --> 08:10.198
So I formed

08:10.266 --> 08:13.436
a small group to locate
and neutralize Dubaku.

08:13.503 --> 08:14.703
Tony Almeida and ultimately, Jack,

08:14.771 --> 08:15.871
joined me.

08:15.939 --> 08:17.973
Tony Almeida was the one
who put the CIP device

08:18.041 --> 08:19.174
into Dubaku's hands

08:19.242 --> 08:20.443
in the first place.

08:20.510 --> 08:23.846
Using the CIP device
as bait was necessary

08:23.914 --> 08:25.614
to the undercover operation.

08:25.682 --> 08:27.349
We had to follow it back to Dubaku.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.350
A lot of people

08:28.418 --> 08:31.587
died on those planes, never mind what

08:31.655 --> 08:34.389
could have happened at the
chemical plant in Kidron!

08:34.457 --> 08:36.625
Madame President, if I may, I was part

08:36.693 --> 08:39.361
of the FBI task force assigned
to recover the CIP device,

08:39.429 --> 08:41.464
and I can personally vouch
for what they're telling you.

08:41.530 --> 08:43.432
The loss of life was tragic, yes,

08:43.500 --> 08:44.900
but in my opinion,

08:44.968 --> 08:47.302
everything these men have done
saved the lives of thousands.

08:49.105 --> 08:53.542
If I choose to believe
everything you're telling me,

08:53.610 --> 08:56.011
where would you go from here?

08:56.079 --> 08:57.212
Dubaku is the only person

08:57.280 --> 08:58.881
with the names of the
people who betrayed you

08:58.949 --> 08:59.949
within your government.

09:00.016 --> 09:01.183
It's imperative that we find him.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.418
We would have to work under the radar.

09:03.487 --> 09:04.887
Any word of an investigation,

09:04.955 --> 09:06.188
people would start running for cover.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.123
You're saying we can't even involve

09:08.191 --> 09:10.058
the FBI and Homeland?

09:10.126 --> 09:11.193
Yes, sir, that's correct.

09:12.529 --> 09:14.262
Madame President,

09:14.330 --> 09:15.598
Tim Woods is on the phone.

09:15.665 --> 09:16.699
He says it's urgent.

09:16.766 --> 09:17.867
Put him through.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.334
Put him through.

09:19.402 --> 09:20.769
Have a seat.

09:22.839 --> 09:24.039
Yes?

09:24.107 --> 09:25.608
Madame President, I'm
sorry to interrupt.

09:25.675 --> 09:27.810
There's a call for you from Ike Dubaku.

09:27.878 --> 09:30.212
Voice I.D. confirms that. He
says it's about your husband.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.581
My husband?

09:32.649 --> 09:35.684
Yes, ma'am. I'll connect you.

09:38.221 --> 09:40.589
This is President Taylor.

09:40.657 --> 09:42.892
I'll come straight to the
point, Madame President.

09:42.959 --> 09:44.426
I have your husband.

09:44.494 --> 09:46.762
Let me demonstrate.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.263
Say something.

09:49.866 --> 09:50.799
Allison...

09:50.867 --> 09:53.669
Henry, are you all right?

09:53.737 --> 09:55.137
I'm fine.

09:55.204 --> 09:56.772
I'm sorry about this.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.307
For God sake, don't let them use me

09:59.375 --> 10:00.976
to influence you in any way.

10:03.146 --> 10:04.413
Our demands are as follows:

10:04.480 --> 10:06.048
You will have your forces

10:06.115 --> 10:08.316
withdrawn from around
my country, Sangala,

10:08.384 --> 10:09.885
immediately and permanently.

10:09.953 --> 10:13.756
Also, Motobo must be delivered to my men

10:13.823 --> 10:15.724
who will be stationed at the east lot

10:15.792 --> 10:17.560
of the Stanswick Power Plant.

10:17.627 --> 10:20.429
If he's not there by 4:00,

10:20.496 --> 10:23.032
or if anybody attempts
to follow or impede my men

10:23.099 --> 10:24.533
when they leave the plant,

10:24.601 --> 10:27.269
your husband will die a
slow and certain death.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.872
You wouldn't dare!

10:29.940 --> 10:31.239
Cut off his finger.

10:52.562 --> 10:54.697
Stop it!

10:56.132 --> 10:57.399
Stop it!

11:00.637 --> 11:02.504
Meet my demands

11:02.572 --> 11:05.440
or I will send him back
to you one piece at a time.

11:05.508 --> 11:09.578
Do you understand, Madame President?

11:09.646 --> 11:10.779
Yes,

11:10.847 --> 11:11.947
I understand.

11:12.015 --> 11:13.015
Any attempt

11:13.083 --> 11:14.349
to find your husband

11:14.417 --> 11:16.051
will be known to me very quickly,

11:16.119 --> 11:18.687
and I will kill him immediately.

11:21.557 --> 11:24.226
Madame President, I just heard back

11:24.293 --> 11:26.829
from the team I sent to
Henry's last-known location.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.163
They found Samantha Roth's

11:28.231 --> 11:30.432
and Secret Service Agent Gedge's bodies.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.600
Oh, God!

11:31.668 --> 11:33.769
Gedge had possession
of a paralytic drug.

11:33.837 --> 11:36.505
That and other evidence on
scene suggests he was complicit

11:36.572 --> 11:39.108
in Henry's abduction,
which, of course, confirms

11:39.175 --> 11:42.077
the corruption you just told us about.

11:42.145 --> 11:45.948
Madame President, time is tight.

11:46.016 --> 11:48.416
We need to decide how to respond.

11:48.484 --> 11:50.485
I don't think anyone would blame you

11:50.553 --> 11:54.023
for holding back, at least temporarily,

11:54.090 --> 11:56.025
the invasion of Sangala.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.762
How many people died on those planes?

12:01.430 --> 12:02.597
How many?!

12:02.666 --> 12:04.266
About 300, ma'am.

12:04.333 --> 12:09.004
All because I refused to
change course in Sangala.

12:17.513 --> 12:21.316
How can I ask the American
people to make sacrifices

12:21.384 --> 12:24.452
that I'm not willing to make myself?

12:28.692 --> 12:32.294
I can't give in.

12:32.361 --> 12:34.629
I can't.

12:35.665 --> 12:37.900
Madame President...

12:37.967 --> 12:39.902
we can still try and find your husband

12:39.969 --> 12:41.403
before the 4:00 deadline.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.707
Dubaku has specifically forbidden that.

12:44.774 --> 12:47.409
And according to you,
I can't trust any of my

12:47.476 --> 12:48.577
law enforcement agencies.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.812
You can trust me.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.648
Right now everyone believes
that Agent Walker is dead,

12:53.717 --> 12:55.517
and I have no status at all.

12:55.585 --> 12:56.919
Which means that Dubaku's spies

12:56.986 --> 13:00.522
cannot track us because
officially, we don't exist.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.457
You resigned from government service,

13:02.525 --> 13:06.361
and the Senate regards you as
having been a renegade agent.

13:08.664 --> 13:12.835
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

13:12.902 --> 13:17.539
With all due respect,
Madame President, ask around.

13:24.714 --> 13:26.782
What could you even do
on such short notice?

13:26.850 --> 13:28.683
I couldn't make you any promises,

13:28.752 --> 13:31.620
but we will do everything
possible to save your husband.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.455
Right now, we need you to go along

13:33.522 --> 13:37.392
with Dubaku's demands.
Help buy us some time.

13:38.995 --> 13:41.730
Madame President, you
don't have another choice.

13:46.202 --> 13:48.203
All right.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.539
All right.

13:51.607 --> 13:54.977
Find him, please?

13:55.044 --> 13:56.812
Yes, ma'am.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.947
We're gonna need a secure hard line.

14:13.496 --> 14:15.563
You may use this room if you need to.

14:15.631 --> 14:17.199
I'll have you escorted back out through

14:17.267 --> 14:18.667
the underground entrance
when you're ready.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.302
I'm gonna need a copy of the president

14:20.369 --> 14:21.736
and the First Gentleman's
Secret Service details.

14:21.805 --> 14:23.071
I'll have them brought to you.

14:23.139 --> 14:24.572
Thank you.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.075
Okay, we'll start off with Agent Gedge.

14:27.143 --> 14:28.777
We need access to his phone records.

14:28.845 --> 14:31.013
I want to know who he's been
talking to over the last few hours.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.981
Obviously, we can't use any of

14:33.049 --> 14:34.416
the president's security people.

14:36.352 --> 14:37.920
Thank you.

14:40.723 --> 14:42.024
Phone logs are highly classified,

14:42.091 --> 14:44.092
especially for agents
assigned to the First Family.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.593
Can Chloe O'Brian get access?

14:45.661 --> 14:46.661
It'll be faster if we can get someone

14:46.729 --> 14:47.662
who's already got clearance.

14:47.730 --> 14:48.730
Larry Moss.

14:48.798 --> 14:50.532
He doesn't strike me

14:50.599 --> 14:52.534
as someone who's willing
to work outside the system.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.537
That's true, but I think I can
persuade him to do what we need.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.771
You really trust him?

14:56.840 --> 15:00.042
Yes. We know each other pretty well.

15:00.109 --> 15:04.046
Fine. Try him. We don't have much time.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.590
Agent Moss.

15:15.658 --> 15:18.126
Larry, it's Renee. I'm alive,

15:18.194 --> 15:20.628
but you can't let anyone
know. Do you understand me?

15:20.696 --> 15:22.965
Oh, my God.

15:27.871 --> 15:31.439
Renee? What... Where are
you? Are you all right?

15:31.507 --> 15:33.275
I'm-I'm fine. I'll explain later,

15:33.343 --> 15:35.177
but right now we need your help.

15:35.245 --> 15:36.378
Who's, who's "we"?

15:36.445 --> 15:38.046
Myself and Jack Bauer.

15:38.114 --> 15:39.414
What?!

15:39.482 --> 15:42.284
He's on our side,
Larry, just like he said.

15:42.352 --> 15:44.552
Everything that he did, he
did to preserve his cover.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.922
Renee, this whole time I've
been thinking you were dead.

15:46.990 --> 15:48.257
Why didn't you tell me?

15:48.324 --> 15:49.591
The Bureau is compromised.

15:49.658 --> 15:52.127
Larry, just like he said,
and on one there can know

15:52.195 --> 15:54.863
about this operation. It has
to stay completely off book.

15:59.035 --> 16:00.402
What operation?

16:00.469 --> 16:02.504
Jack and I are at the White House.

16:02.571 --> 16:05.507
The First Gentleman has
been kidnapped by Ike Dubaku.

16:05.574 --> 16:08.010
I don't, I don't know
anything about that.

16:08.077 --> 16:10.745
It's true. The president's
asked Jack and me to find him.

16:10.813 --> 16:12.147
Very few people know about this,

16:12.215 --> 16:14.182
and that's the way that it has to stay.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.885
If we don't find him by
4:00 p.m., he'll be killed.

16:19.422 --> 16:23.125
Larry... if you've ever trusted me,

16:23.192 --> 16:26.828
trust me now, please, and help me.

16:26.896 --> 16:29.131
What do you want me to do?

16:29.198 --> 16:31.099
Looks like the First
Gentleman's Secret Service agent

16:31.167 --> 16:33.468
was involved in all of
this... Brian Gedge; he's dead.

16:33.536 --> 16:34.970
You need to check his phone logs

16:35.038 --> 16:36.638
and get all the information you can

16:36.705 --> 16:39.308
about who he's been in
contact with recently.

16:42.812 --> 16:45.414
I need to see you to
make sure this is real,

16:45.481 --> 16:46.681
that you're not under duress.

16:46.749 --> 16:48.850
No, there's no time for that.

16:48.918 --> 16:50.552
That's not negotiable.
You want my help, we meet.

16:50.619 --> 16:53.155
The Capitol Reflecting Pool,
as soon as you can get there.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.222
Okay, fine.

16:55.591 --> 16:58.393
He'll help us, I think,
but we need to go.

17:11.576 --> 17:13.111
President Taylor emphasized

17:13.178 --> 17:15.479
the terrorists are no longer a threat

17:15.547 --> 17:17.714
and says the invasion will begin.

17:17.782 --> 17:18.983
She also says

17:19.050 --> 17:21.551
former Prime Minister Ule
Motobo will be reinstated

17:21.619 --> 17:23.655
to work towards building a
new democratic government.

17:23.722 --> 17:24.656
I don't get it.

17:24.723 --> 17:25.690
What?

17:25.758 --> 17:27.090
The president's talking as if

17:27.159 --> 17:29.593
the CIP device and Motobo
have been recovered,

17:29.662 --> 17:31.896
but how could that have happened
without us knowing about it?

17:31.964 --> 17:33.831
Well, it just means
whatever agency's responsible

17:33.899 --> 17:34.832
hasn't let us know.

17:34.900 --> 17:35.833
What other agency?

17:35.901 --> 17:36.868
We're being kept out of the loop,

17:36.935 --> 17:37.935
and I don't like it.

17:40.072 --> 17:42.540
So am I seeing you later?

17:42.607 --> 17:45.710
I don't know. I've got
some things to figure out.

17:45.778 --> 17:46.878
What does that mean?

17:46.945 --> 17:48.612
It means I have to
get home at some point.

17:48.681 --> 17:50.347
I haven't seen Christina in a week.

17:50.415 --> 17:54.018
All right.

17:54.086 --> 17:55.687
Sean, are you all right?

17:55.754 --> 17:58.022
I'm fine.

17:58.090 --> 18:00.892
I'm sensing a little distance.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.626
I just have to get back to work.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.401
Excuse me.

18:10.468 --> 18:13.404
Could you be a little
less obvious, do you think?

18:13.471 --> 18:14.672
What are you talking about?

18:14.740 --> 18:15.740
Give me a break.

18:15.808 --> 18:17.341
Just hold up a sign that says,

18:17.409 --> 18:19.210
"Hey, world, we're sleeping together."

18:19.277 --> 18:20.377
Are you stupid?

18:20.445 --> 18:22.847
I know it's stupid and wrong,

18:22.915 --> 18:24.348
and I'm gonna end it.

18:24.416 --> 18:26.884
Yeah, you'd better, fast,
before Larry notices.

18:26.952 --> 18:28.352
Where is Larry?

18:28.420 --> 18:30.321
I don't know. That's not the point.

18:30.388 --> 18:32.356
The point is, if he
finds out about this,

18:32.424 --> 18:34.692
he's gonna transfer your
ass to Juneau so fast,

18:34.760 --> 18:36.493
your head will spin.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.250
Larry.

19:03.122 --> 19:05.522
Oh, my God.

19:10.528 --> 19:12.864
I thought I'd never see you again.

19:17.702 --> 19:20.304
Were you able to access
Agent Gedge's phone records?

19:22.507 --> 19:23.875
Yeah.

19:23.942 --> 19:25.342
Yeah,

19:25.410 --> 19:27.645
over the last three hours,
Gedge spoke repeatedly

19:27.712 --> 19:29.546
to another Secret Service
agent named Edward Vossler.

19:29.614 --> 19:32.850
I checked out Vossler's
personnel records.

19:32.918 --> 19:35.419
Before he was a Secret Service
agent, he was Special Forces,

19:35.487 --> 19:37.554
and for two years, served in Sangala.

19:37.622 --> 19:40.658
So we can assume Vossler's
working for Dubaku.

19:40.725 --> 19:42.726
Did you bring any of his files with you?

19:42.795 --> 19:44.128
Yeah.

19:48.167 --> 19:50.201
Does Vossler have a family?

19:50.269 --> 19:52.503
Why do you need to know that?

19:52.570 --> 19:54.038
Does he have a family?

19:54.106 --> 19:56.307
He's been married for
five years to a paralegal.

19:56.374 --> 19:58.843
They have an
11-month-old baby boy.

19:58.911 --> 20:00.644
She left her job to
stay home with the kid.

20:00.712 --> 20:01.913
Okay, we're gonna need to split up.

20:01.980 --> 20:03.547
I need you to help me track Vossler.

20:03.615 --> 20:06.818
I need you to go to his home
and hope his family is there.

20:06.885 --> 20:08.452
Vossler was Special Forces.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.354
There's no way we're gonna break
him in the time that we've got.

20:10.422 --> 20:12.523
The only way to get him
to cooperate is to make him

20:12.590 --> 20:14.491
think we're gonna hurt his
family, his wife and his kid.

20:14.559 --> 20:16.627
No, absolutely not. Renee?

20:16.695 --> 20:17.929
That's stepping over the line, Jack.

20:17.996 --> 20:19.697
You stepped over the line

20:19.764 --> 20:20.898
the second you interrogated Tanner.

20:20.966 --> 20:22.399
Tanner's a murderer.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.735
As far as we know, Vossler's
wife is completely innocent,

20:24.803 --> 20:25.903
let alone a small child.

20:25.971 --> 20:27.638
When are you people gonna stop thinking

20:27.706 --> 20:28.940
everyone else is following your rules?!

20:29.007 --> 20:30.407
They're not!

20:30.475 --> 20:32.109
Dubaku is gonna kill Henry Taylor

20:32.177 --> 20:33.444
within the next 45 minutes

20:33.511 --> 20:35.412
unless we find him.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.747
You've got one of two choices:

20:36.815 --> 20:38.816
Now you can either phone the
president and explain to her

20:38.884 --> 20:40.084
that your conscience won't allow you

20:40.152 --> 20:41.785
to do what is necessary to save him,

20:41.854 --> 20:45.589
or you can simply do what is necessary.

20:45.657 --> 20:47.959
Pick one!

20:52.197 --> 20:53.231
Renee?

20:53.298 --> 20:54.398
Larry!

20:59.838 --> 21:00.838
Renee?

21:00.906 --> 21:02.473
I'm gonna need your vehicle.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.041
Start tracking Vossler
through his cell phone.

21:04.109 --> 21:05.809
Utilize his Secret
Service deployment grid.

21:05.878 --> 21:07.644
Look at yourself.

21:07.712 --> 21:11.782
You've lost everyone and
everything you ever had

21:11.850 --> 21:13.951
by doing what you think is necessary.

21:14.019 --> 21:16.453
I won't let you do it to her, Bauer.

21:16.521 --> 21:19.924
Renee will not end up like you.

21:24.062 --> 21:27.265
Are you gonna give me your keys or not?

21:42.047 --> 21:43.747
Jack.

21:43.815 --> 21:44.982
Jack!

21:46.919 --> 21:49.887
The rules are what make us better.

21:49.955 --> 21:52.189
Not today.

22:03.936 --> 22:06.070
Even those who oppose
the plan to invade Sangala

22:06.138 --> 22:09.873
can't deny the atrocities
committed by that regime.

22:09.942 --> 22:12.043
I slowed down Taylor's bleeding,

22:12.110 --> 22:13.677
but I can't get it to stop completely.

22:13.745 --> 22:14.946
Tourniquet is as tight as possible?

22:15.013 --> 22:16.280
Yes.

22:16.348 --> 22:17.281
Then cauterize the wound.

22:17.349 --> 22:18.682
Mikali has a blowtorch.

22:18.750 --> 22:19.783
You risk Taylor going into shock.

22:19.851 --> 22:21.518
Just put something in his mouth.

22:21.586 --> 22:23.421
I don't want him biting his
tongue off with the pain.

22:23.488 --> 22:26.457
Hey, what are you doing at home, huh?

22:26.524 --> 22:27.858
I thought you'd be at work.

22:27.926 --> 22:31.028
I was. Rosa called me at the diner.

22:31.096 --> 22:33.064
She was having one of her episodes.

22:33.131 --> 22:35.232
You know your sister.
She's just manipulating you.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.401
You don't have to go to
her every time she calls.

22:37.469 --> 22:39.570
I'm all she has, Samuel. Be kind.

22:41.039 --> 22:42.639
You know, you're kind
enough for both of us.

22:42.707 --> 22:44.108
I just wanted to make sure

22:44.176 --> 22:45.876
that you were still
coming to dinner tonight.

22:45.944 --> 22:49.947
Um, look, I'm really sorry, but I can't.

22:50.015 --> 22:51.648
I'm looking at a stack
of shipping manifests.

22:51.716 --> 22:54.852
Oh, no! Isn't there some way?

22:54.919 --> 22:56.854
We could do it as late as you want.

22:56.921 --> 22:59.390
I really wish I could.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.824
I'm sorry, Marika.

23:00.892 --> 23:02.994
Uh, listen, baby,

23:03.061 --> 23:04.828
I'll make it up to you, okay?

23:04.896 --> 23:06.864
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make extra

23:06.931 --> 23:08.565
just in case you change your mind.

23:08.633 --> 23:09.933
You're too good to me.

23:10.002 --> 23:11.435
You're right.

23:17.175 --> 23:19.010
I have to get back to the diner, Rosa.

23:19.077 --> 23:20.011
Are you gonna be okay?

23:20.078 --> 23:21.912
Who was that on the phone?

23:21.980 --> 23:25.082
It was him, wasn't it?

23:25.150 --> 23:26.250
All right, stop.

23:26.318 --> 23:28.685
I know you don't approve

23:28.753 --> 23:30.587
of Samuel, but I love him.

23:30.655 --> 23:32.390
Oh. You love him?

23:32.457 --> 23:34.291
Why?

23:34.359 --> 23:36.894
Because he spends money on you?

23:36.961 --> 23:38.695
Because he pays our rent?

23:38.763 --> 23:40.131
You've only known him

23:40.198 --> 23:41.165
four months.

23:41.233 --> 23:42.400
What difference does that make?

23:42.467 --> 23:44.268
You don't know anything about him.

23:44.336 --> 23:47.238
What if he's not the
importer he says he is?

23:47.305 --> 23:49.673
Or that he's in this country illegally?

23:49.741 --> 23:50.841
Not this again.

23:50.909 --> 23:52.410
I'm just trying to protect you, Marika.

23:52.477 --> 23:54.545
I don't need your protection.

23:54.612 --> 23:55.646
Yes, you do.

23:56.614 --> 23:59.250
This man isn't...

23:59.317 --> 24:01.452
Isn't what?

24:05.123 --> 24:06.690
Nothing.

24:06.758 --> 24:08.992
Forget it.

24:09.061 --> 24:10.994
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.

24:11.063 --> 24:12.996
I'll be home after my shift.

24:28.313 --> 24:32.049
We can appear to comply with
the first part of Dubaku's demand

24:32.117 --> 24:33.617
by pulling the fleet back.

24:33.685 --> 24:36.753
Then we simply launch the
invasion from farther out at sea.

24:36.821 --> 24:39.323
Now, the second part of his
demand is more complicated.

24:39.391 --> 24:41.692
If we were really turning Matobo over,

24:41.759 --> 24:43.461
we'd be putting him in
a car right about now.

24:43.528 --> 24:45.729
That's out of the
question. We need him safe.

24:45.797 --> 24:49.467
Agreed. But we can send
a car with a look-alike.

24:49.534 --> 24:51.902
If we handle it right, Dubaku
won't be aware of the deception

24:51.970 --> 24:53.170
until the last minute.

24:53.238 --> 24:54.805
By then, hopefully,
we'll have found Henry.

24:54.872 --> 24:58.675
Madame President, do we have
your authorization to proceed?

25:00.212 --> 25:01.678
Yes.

25:09.321 --> 25:10.621
This is Bauer.

25:10.688 --> 25:12.623
Okay, I've got Vossler.
He's on the Beltway

25:12.690 --> 25:16.594
near Bethesda, moving south,
about seven miles from you.

25:16.661 --> 25:18.929
Copy that. I'm on my
way. Where's he headed?

25:18.997 --> 25:20.764
According to the Secret Service log,

25:20.832 --> 25:22.399
his shift starts at 4:00 p.m.

25:22.467 --> 25:24.868
He's meeting a foreign
dignitary's plane at Andrews.

25:24.936 --> 25:26.637
Jack, I don't have to tell you...

25:26.704 --> 25:28.139
once he's through that
gate and onto that base,

25:28.206 --> 25:29.640
you're not going to
be able to touch him.

25:29.707 --> 25:31.708
Okay, he's going to have
to double back on the 337

25:31.776 --> 25:33.344
if he wants to get
through that main gate.

25:33.411 --> 25:35.379
I should be able to make up
time by taking Connecticut.

25:35.447 --> 25:37.281
Just keep sight of him.

25:37.349 --> 25:40.017
Have you heard from Renee?

25:40.084 --> 25:42.386
Do we know if she's arrived
at Vossler's house yet?

25:42.454 --> 25:44.255
No. But she knows how
to get in touch with us

25:44.322 --> 25:45.489
if she's in trouble.

26:05.544 --> 26:07.444
Coming.

26:09.914 --> 26:11.549
Can I help you?

26:13.618 --> 26:14.885
Who are you?

26:14.952 --> 26:17.154
Shut up. Do what I tell
you, and there's a chance

26:17.222 --> 26:18.689
you'll live through this.

26:37.916 --> 26:40.884
Don't move! He's scared.

26:40.952 --> 26:43.220
Stay where you are or I will
shoot you where you stand.

26:43.288 --> 26:45.956
You're going to kill me for
trying to comfort my baby?

26:46.024 --> 26:48.459
Sit down.

26:48.527 --> 26:49.927
What kind of a person are you?

26:49.994 --> 26:51.062
Doing this to us.

26:52.364 --> 26:54.465
You should ask your husband that.

26:54.533 --> 26:56.800
What are you talking about?

26:58.303 --> 27:00.104
Edward is a good man.

27:00.172 --> 27:02.706
Maybe you don't know him quite
as well as you think you do.

27:02.774 --> 27:04.775
I know he would never point
a gun near a child. Shut up!

27:09.847 --> 27:11.882
Put the cuff around your wrist.

27:11.950 --> 27:13.050
Don't do this.

27:13.118 --> 27:14.051
Now!

27:25.663 --> 27:27.064
Okay, where is he now?

27:27.132 --> 27:28.899
He just got off the Beltway.

27:28.967 --> 27:30.334
He's stopped in traffic.

27:30.402 --> 27:32.136
Okay, I'm coming up on the intersection

27:32.204 --> 27:34.238
of Allenford and Auth. I
should be there in 30 seconds.

27:34.306 --> 27:35.606
Just let me know if he moves.

27:41.646 --> 27:42.846
He's moving.

27:42.914 --> 27:43.847
Damn it!

27:43.915 --> 27:45.015
What's the next street north?

27:45.083 --> 27:46.283
Baxter Drive.

27:46.351 --> 27:47.751
But, Jack, it's a one-way street.

27:47.819 --> 27:49.019
Copy that.

27:54.226 --> 27:56.327
He made the light at Allenford.

28:00.565 --> 28:01.765
I'm on Baxter.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.134
He's 15 seconds away, Jack.

28:10.242 --> 28:11.375
Ten seconds.

28:15.046 --> 28:16.247
Five seconds.

28:18.316 --> 28:19.316
I got him.

28:29.060 --> 28:31.662
Let me see your hands!

28:31.729 --> 28:32.863
Now!

28:34.399 --> 28:37.734
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

28:39.638 --> 28:41.738
Move. Move!

28:49.381 --> 28:51.248
Where is he?

28:51.316 --> 28:54.017
Where is Henry Taylor? I don't
know what you're talking about.

28:54.085 --> 28:55.085
Where is he?

28:56.488 --> 28:57.954
Fine,

28:58.022 --> 28:59.523
we'll do this your way.

29:05.096 --> 29:06.597
Yes.

29:06.665 --> 29:07.665
I've got Vossler. You got his wife?

29:07.732 --> 29:10.867
And his child. You ready?

29:10.935 --> 29:12.503
Yes.

29:12.571 --> 29:14.037
Put your phone on speaker.

29:14.105 --> 29:16.640
Talk to your wife.

29:16.708 --> 29:19.710
You son of a bitch... Talk to your wife!

29:19.777 --> 29:22.713
Carol, ar-are you all right?

29:22.780 --> 29:26.016
There's a woman with a gun.
She's threatening to kill me.

29:26.084 --> 29:27.451
Why is Conner crying?

29:27.519 --> 29:28.752
Oh, my God, Edward.

29:28.820 --> 29:31.088
What's happening? Who are these people?

29:31.155 --> 29:34.425
You are running out of time.

29:34.492 --> 29:36.126
I didn't want to have to do this.

29:36.194 --> 29:39.029
No, you wouldn't...

29:39.097 --> 29:43.434
What's happening? I don't
know. She's got Conner.

29:43.501 --> 29:45.936
Oh, my God, she's doing
something to Conner!

29:46.003 --> 29:48.038
Let go of my baby!

29:48.106 --> 29:50.274
He's just a baby! Please!

29:50.342 --> 29:53.644
What the hell are you doing? You can
stop this. Just tell me where he is.

29:53.712 --> 29:57.314
For God's sake, Edward, tell
them what they want to know!

29:57.382 --> 30:00.451
Damn it! All right, all
right, I'll tell you!

30:01.953 --> 30:04.321
Stand down. I'll get back to you.

30:11.896 --> 30:13.964
Your baby's fine.

30:18.236 --> 30:20.571
You're a monster!

30:23.074 --> 30:24.508
Where is he?!

30:24.576 --> 30:26.510
You tell me now, or the situation

30:26.578 --> 30:27.978
for your family goes from bad to worse.

30:28.045 --> 30:29.480
Where is he?

30:29.547 --> 30:32.449
How do I know you're just
not going to kill them anyway?

30:32.517 --> 30:33.651
You don't.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.054
Fine.

30:38.122 --> 30:41.625
There's a greengrocer,
12451 Arlington Avenue.

30:41.693 --> 30:43.226
They're holding him in the basement.

30:43.295 --> 30:44.295
Access.

30:44.362 --> 30:45.429
There's a staircase in the back,

30:45.497 --> 30:46.530
but it's always locked.

30:46.598 --> 30:47.898
Is Dubaku with him? He was.

30:47.965 --> 30:49.232
How many guns are guarding him?

30:49.301 --> 30:50.668
At least four. Get out of here!

31:38.149 --> 31:40.183
Get away from the car!

31:40.251 --> 31:42.619
Walk away... now!

31:44.689 --> 31:46.390
Damn it.

31:49.627 --> 31:50.561
Stop!

31:50.628 --> 31:52.363
Get out of the car now!

31:52.430 --> 31:53.997
Move! Move!

32:11.478 --> 32:14.580
The goal is to make it look like
we're going to hand Matobo over

32:14.648 --> 32:16.649
for as long as is reasonably possible.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.585
When you get to the rendezvous point,

32:19.653 --> 32:21.054
keep your distance from Dubaku's men.

32:21.122 --> 32:22.622
Let them see you in the backseat,

32:22.690 --> 32:24.357
but do not get out of the car.

32:24.425 --> 32:27.227
Don't let them get any closer
than you feel comfortable with.

32:27.295 --> 32:29.930
As soon as you start to feel
that the risk is unacceptable,

32:29.997 --> 32:31.031
get the hell out.

32:31.098 --> 32:32.866
That's straight from the president.

32:32.934 --> 32:34.667
Clear? Clear.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.469
Good luck.

32:43.144 --> 32:44.077
Jack?

32:44.145 --> 32:45.312
I got an address

32:45.379 --> 32:47.914
for Henry Taylor.
12451 Arlington Avenue.

32:47.982 --> 32:50.116
It's a storefront. He's
being held in the basement.

32:50.184 --> 32:52.518
If you get there before I
do, I want you to stand down.

32:52.586 --> 32:54.120
Dubaku's got at least four gunmen there.

32:54.188 --> 32:55.688
All right. Meanwhile,
I'm going to call Bill,

32:55.756 --> 32:56.789
pull him up to speed.

32:56.858 --> 32:58.691
I want you to do the
same thing with Larry.

32:58.759 --> 32:59.960
And what about Vossler? He's dead.

33:00.027 --> 33:02.996
He attacked me. I didn't have a choice.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.031
Are you okay?

33:10.404 --> 33:12.839
No, I don't think I am.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.941
What do you mean? What's wrong?

33:18.579 --> 33:20.613
Agent Walker, are you still there?

33:20.681 --> 33:23.416
I'm not...

33:23.484 --> 33:25.518
Listen to me.

33:25.586 --> 33:28.288
We could not have gotten
this far if it wasn't for you.

33:28.356 --> 33:30.023
Okay?

33:30.091 --> 33:33.793
No one would blame you if this was
just too much for you to handle.

33:33.861 --> 33:37.097
Maybe you should get out.

33:37.164 --> 33:39.665
Maybe I will.

33:39.733 --> 33:42.102
Yeah.

33:42.169 --> 33:44.504
Tomorrow.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.918
Agent Masden and I are on our way.

33:57.985 --> 33:59.386
We'll be tracking you via satellite.

33:59.453 --> 34:01.421
Check in with me when you're
approaching the power plant.

34:01.488 --> 34:02.488
Yes, sir.

34:02.556 --> 34:04.690
How much time do you
think this will buy us?

34:04.758 --> 34:07.727
Until Dubaku realizes
Matobo's not in the limo.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.429
Ten minutes, maybe 15.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.664
That's 15 minutes more than we had.

34:11.732 --> 34:14.699
Madame President, I just got
off the phone with Jack Bauer.

34:14.768 --> 34:17.036
He and Agent Walker think they
have a location on your husband.

34:17.103 --> 34:18.471
Where?

34:18.539 --> 34:20.005
Arlington Avenue.
They're on their way now.

34:20.074 --> 34:21.975
How long will it take them?

34:22.043 --> 34:23.476
Ten, 15 minutes.

34:23.543 --> 34:25.178
Thank you.

34:29.449 --> 34:31.217
This just came over from Homeland.

34:31.284 --> 34:32.452
Like you said...

34:32.518 --> 34:33.686
we're being kept out of the loop.

34:33.754 --> 34:36.022
Thanks.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.130
Did you see this?

34:45.699 --> 34:47.900
Homeland's preparing to
lower the threat level

34:47.969 --> 34:49.034
at the president's request.

34:49.103 --> 34:50.170
Yeah, I saw the flash.

34:50.237 --> 34:51.838
Don't you think that's odd,

34:51.905 --> 34:54.074
considering we don't know anything
about the CIP device being recovered?

34:54.141 --> 34:56.742
Yeah. I'll talk to Homeland.

34:56.810 --> 34:58.478
All I'm saying is... I get the feeling

34:58.545 --> 35:00.646
like there's something going
on behind our back here.

35:00.714 --> 35:02.515
Like I said, I'll talk to them.

35:07.121 --> 35:09.856
Excuse me. Yeah, sure.

35:12.726 --> 35:14.660
Where are you?

35:14.728 --> 35:16.929
On my way to where we think
Henry Taylor's being held.

35:16.998 --> 35:20.000
So you got Vossler to talk.

35:20.067 --> 35:23.003
It gave us our only chance to
rescue the president's husband.

35:23.070 --> 35:24.004
What's the address?

35:24.071 --> 35:25.438
I'll send a SWAT team to meet you.

35:25.506 --> 35:26.572
You know you can't do that.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.673
The Bureau's compromised.

35:27.741 --> 35:29.976
It will jeopardize any
attempt that we make.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.212
But there is something
else I need you to do.

35:32.279 --> 35:33.779
Okay, what's that?

35:33.847 --> 35:35.115
Keep an incident quiet

35:35.182 --> 35:37.283
until what Jack and
I are doing goes down.

35:37.351 --> 35:38.284
What incident?

35:38.352 --> 35:39.785
Vossler's dead.

35:39.853 --> 35:41.854
Jack killed him at the
hotel on 18th and Riggin.

35:41.922 --> 35:42.922
It was self-defense.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.557
Is that what he told you?

35:44.625 --> 35:47.560
Larry... Damn it, Renee, what the
hell are you doing with this guy?

35:47.628 --> 35:49.795
We're supposed to bring
suspects in, not murder them.

35:49.863 --> 35:51.131
Larry, please...

35:51.198 --> 35:53.766
And until we know who
Dubaku's source is there,

35:53.834 --> 35:56.336
you've got to handle this
outside of the Bureau, okay?

36:00.307 --> 36:03.609
There's a guy at D.C.
Metro I know I can trust.

36:03.677 --> 36:05.378
I'll have him deal with Vossler.

36:05.446 --> 36:07.447
Thank you, Larry.

36:10.117 --> 36:12.952
I understand. I will let him know.

36:13.020 --> 36:16.189
According to our sources,
a vehicle containing Matobo

36:16.257 --> 36:17.590
just left the White House. Good.

36:17.658 --> 36:19.325
What is the state of the
American invasion forces?

36:19.393 --> 36:20.593
The fleet is withdrawing

36:20.661 --> 36:22.529
from Sangalan territorial waters,

36:22.596 --> 36:24.297
and has set steam for the 23rd Meridian.

36:24.365 --> 36:25.965
Excellent.

36:26.033 --> 36:27.067
Hello.

36:27.134 --> 36:28.634
It's Rosa.

36:28.702 --> 36:31.471
Rosa, if you're looking for
Marika, she's not with me.

36:31.539 --> 36:32.772
I'm looking for you, Samuel.

36:32.839 --> 36:35.141
Or whatever your real name is.

36:35.209 --> 36:37.977
What are you talking about?

36:38.045 --> 36:40.180
My sister may be naive, but I'm not.

36:40.247 --> 36:43.916
I checked with someone I
know at Immigration Services,

36:43.984 --> 36:47.420
and no one named Samuel
Aboa emigrated from Sangala

36:47.488 --> 36:49.989
in the last year, or
in the last 15 years.

36:50.057 --> 36:52.125
Well, they've obviously made a mistake.

36:52.193 --> 36:53.593
You're making a mistake.

36:53.660 --> 36:56.429
Now I don't know who you
really are, and I don't care.

36:56.497 --> 36:58.498
I just want you out of my sister's life.

36:58.566 --> 36:59.799
Does Marika know about this?

36:59.866 --> 37:02.001
No, not yet.

37:02.069 --> 37:03.703
And I'm willing to keep it that way.

37:03.770 --> 37:05.638
So you've not reported me to anyone?

37:05.706 --> 37:08.908
No. I don't want Marika to
know anything about this.

37:09.943 --> 37:11.544
What do you want?

37:11.612 --> 37:13.045
Break up with her,

37:13.114 --> 37:15.648
and this stays between us.

37:15.716 --> 37:16.983
You just end it tonight,

37:17.050 --> 37:19.685
and we won't have a problem.

37:28.962 --> 37:31.264
I have to take care of a little problem.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.865
Call me when we have Matobo.

38:04.138 --> 38:05.405
Yeah.

38:05.472 --> 38:07.040
The vehicle that's supposed
to be delivering Matobo

38:07.108 --> 38:09.142
is arriving at the power
plant. If we delay any longer,

38:09.210 --> 38:12.045
Dubaku is going to get
suspicious. What's your status?

38:12.113 --> 38:14.514
I'm almosthere. How much time
can you buy us? I dot know, Jack.

38:14.581 --> 38:17.450
Okay, Agent Walker and I will
move in as soon as I get there.

38:17.518 --> 38:18.518
I'll keep you posted.

38:18.585 --> 38:20.320
All right, good luck.

38:20.387 --> 38:21.788
This is Agent Smith.

38:21.856 --> 38:23.824
We've got a visual on
Dubaku's men. Understood.

38:23.891 --> 38:25.192
We have it on satellite.

38:48.082 --> 38:50.183
Bring him to us.

38:58.726 --> 39:01.161
They've ordered us
to get out of the car.

39:01.229 --> 39:04.397
Now one of them is making
a call. Hang tight, Agent.

39:04.465 --> 39:06.166
Their car arrived,

39:06.234 --> 39:08.534
but nothing is happening. What
do you mean nothing is happening?

39:08.602 --> 39:10.570
We ordered them to
hand Matobo over to us

39:10.637 --> 39:12.705
but no one's getting out of the vehicle.

39:12.773 --> 39:15.041
The Americans have been playing us.

39:15.109 --> 39:16.243
Destroy their vehicle.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.777
Yes, sir.

39:17.845 --> 39:21.948
That's long enough. Get them
the hell out of there. Retreat.

39:22.016 --> 39:24.417
Get out now. Roger that.

39:47.208 --> 39:48.975
You ready? Yes.

39:49.043 --> 39:50.343
Let's go.

39:55.983 --> 39:59.386
Get out from behind
the counter. Now! Move!

40:07.861 --> 40:10.797
Okay, I want you to unlock that door.

40:10.864 --> 40:13.900
And I want you to ask those
men what they want to eat.

40:13.968 --> 40:15.402
You do one thing I don't like,

40:15.469 --> 40:17.938
and I will blow your head
off, you understand me?

40:18.005 --> 40:19.172
Open the door.

40:32.653 --> 40:34.154
Want anything to eat?

40:34.221 --> 40:37.457
No. Some cold beers. Okay.

41:40.754 --> 41:41.921
Yes.

41:41.989 --> 41:44.257
Kill Henry Taylor.

41:44.325 --> 41:46.359
Then we have nothing to
hold over their heads.

41:46.427 --> 41:48.361
We don't have anything now.

41:48.429 --> 41:50.397
The president was
willing to let him die.

41:50.464 --> 41:51.498
We are done here.

41:51.565 --> 41:52.865
Kill Taylor,

41:52.933 --> 41:54.401
and have your men pack everything up.

41:54.468 --> 41:55.568
Understood.

42:40.847 --> 42:42.782
Oh, my God.

42:42.849 --> 42:45.085
Sir... sir...

42:45.152 --> 42:47.487
We're going to get you help.

42:47.555 --> 42:49.222
Just stay with me.

42:51.858 --> 42:53.259
Get an ambulance!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
