Nothing.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.275
Granted, this isn't scientific,

00:14.362 --> 00:16.407
but the fact that
Reese can't get brain freeze

01:03.324 --> 01:04.586
We finally got back
at Tim Schwab and his brother.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.544
-What'd you do?
-We found a dead octopus

01:06.631 --> 01:08.111
in a dumpster
at the seafood store.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.939
We shoved its mouth full
of medical waste

01:10.026 --> 01:11.854
and put it in
the Schwabs' air conditioner.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.725
That'll teach him
to say we're obnoxious.

01:13.812 --> 01:16.163
-Why didn't you let me help?
-It couldn't wait, Dewey.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.382
With a dead octopus,
there's a very small window

01:18.469 --> 01:20.297
before it starts smelling
like just another dead fish.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.734

Well, can't take a walk without
our jackets anymore, Jamie.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.093
It's the first cool day of fall.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.486
Yeah, Fall reminds adults
about our mortality.

You're telling me my family
hasn't had health insurance

01:46.323 --> 01:47.933
for the last six months?!

01:48.020 --> 01:50.414
Yes, I know
you never got the check!

01:50.501 --> 01:53.330
There must be some sort
of grace period.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.723
And when those two months
are over,

01:54.810 --> 01:56.638
what's the grace period on that?

01:57.595 --> 02:00.642
No, you-- you can't wait
until Monday to reinstate us.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.513
We can't go through
the whole weekend

02:02.600 --> 02:04.428
without health insurance.

Oh, okay, Steven.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.713
Let me level with you.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.673
Six months ago my wife asked me
to do one thing. One.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.936
I was supposed
to mail your check.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.372
The woman relies on the fact

02:35.459 --> 02:37.592
that I can be
occasionally trusted

02:37.679 --> 02:40.029
to perform
very simple menial tasks.

02:40.116 --> 02:41.683
Now, if you don't start
my insurance,

02:41.770 --> 02:43.685
and if anything happens
to anyone in this family,

02:43.772 --> 02:45.295
I am going to have
to explain to her

02:45.382 --> 02:49.430
that her entire life
is built on a lie!

02:49.517 --> 02:54.522
Well, I just hope that when your
marriage blows up in your face,

02:54.609 --> 02:55.958

It was just
his allergies.

Allergies?

03:29.818 --> 03:31.080
Or disease?

03:32.386 --> 03:35.345
There are a lot of viruses
going around.

so disappointed.

to Mommy's job interview.

some other time.

we affiliate ourselves
with the Teamsters.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.933
They can deliver
a benefits package

04:42.020 --> 04:44.632
that's quite substantial.

to just listen.

we're talking union,

we'll lose all our perks.

for organizing this meeting.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.056
that Mr. Cochran makes
a lot more money than us.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.581
And I strongly feel
that on that basis alone,

05:20.668 --> 05:21.799
he should be trusted.

Oh, for God's sake, Craig.

You know what
really bothers me?

his car out front every morning

05:28.632 --> 05:31.069
and we've got to park
nine blocks away.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.767
They let us use the shuttle
to get to our cars.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.812
That's the city bus, Craig.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.424
I appreciate all the anger
that's in this room,

05:37.511 --> 05:40.688
and God knows I'm not one
to shy away from a fight,

05:40.775 --> 05:43.168
but I suggest that instead
of starting a union,

05:43.255 --> 05:44.561
we form a special committee

05:44.648 --> 05:46.955
to maybe paint
Mr. Cochran's house

05:47.042 --> 05:49.479
so he'll want to be nice to us.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.400
I have never felt
we needed a union,

05:57.487 --> 06:01.491
but when I think about what this
place has done to some of us,

06:01.578 --> 06:05.190
how it's made us so afraid
to even voice our opinions,

06:05.277 --> 06:07.279
then I think maybe we do.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.676
Okay, but let the record show

06:12.763 --> 06:15.810
that I advocated a policy
of cowardice and appeasement.

oh, it's so complicated.

we'd save on health insurance.

dressing provocatively,

10:15.527 --> 10:17.355
I'm 17.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.096
And so you can't die?

10:19.183 --> 10:20.924
I just don't see it happening.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.404
I got news for you, Reese.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.406
17-year-olds die all the time.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.364
Oh, come on, Dad.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.062
That's just something they tell
you so you'll stay off drugs.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.368
That's it!
You're all grounded in your room

10:30.455 --> 10:31.543
for the rest of the weekend!

10:31.631 --> 10:32.632
You can't do that!

10:32.719 --> 10:34.721
I know I'm gonna die, Dad.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.505
Nobody is dying in this family

10:36.592 --> 10:37.854
until the start of business
Monday morning!

10:45.732 --> 10:48.299
Okay, should there be
an actual fire,

10:48.386 --> 10:50.519
I think we'll be
in pretty good shape.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.219
Did you hear?

10:55.306 --> 10:56.917
We did a little investigating.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.309
We found out
who Cochran's snitch is.

10:58.396 --> 10:59.310
Oh, no...

10:59.397 --> 11:00.877
It's Joe.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.923
Joe?
What about Craig?

11:03.010 --> 11:05.926
-What about Craig?
-Um...

11:06.013 --> 11:07.928
Does Craig know
that it's Joe?

11:08.015 --> 11:09.146
Everybody knows.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.582
Cochran just promoted Joe
to manager.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.846
We're going to go
congratulate him.

11:12.933 --> 11:13.977
Can you hand me some soap?

11:14.064 --> 11:15.239
Sure.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.896
[quietly]
Wow, I had it completely wrong.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.818
COCHRAN:
Did you get me the information

11:28.905 --> 11:31.691
I asked for, Feldspar?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.649
CRAIG: Yes, sir.
Lois almost caught me,

11:33.736 --> 11:35.782
but I can assure you
our secret's safe.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.871
COCHRAN:
Good, good. Excellent.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.656
Now, you've got
to tell me everything.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.397
CRAIG:
Of course, sir.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.095
COCHRAN: I'll need a complete
list of names this time.

11:45.182 --> 11:49.447
They're all here; just please,
sir, make sure this stays quiet.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.058
Don't worry about it.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.712
Thank you, Mr. Cochran.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.583
Looks and brains, you're
the complete package, sir!

11:54.670 --> 11:56.237
[gasps]

12:00.676 --> 12:03.331
What the hell are you doing
talking to Mr. Cochran, Craig?

12:03.418 --> 12:05.899
Okay, Lois. If you can tell me
what you think you saw,

12:05.986 --> 12:07.291
that would really help me
focus my answer.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.816
You grabbed hair!
You grabbed hair!

12:11.469 --> 12:12.688
-[shrieks]
-Craig, I heard

12:12.775 --> 12:14.081
you talking
about a list of names.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.822
Oh, that.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.041
Um, we were just rating
all the hotties in the store.

12:18.128 --> 12:21.653
Don't worry, you're holding your
own in both posture and dimples.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.307
You expect me to fall for that?

12:23.394 --> 12:24.395
I'd appreciate it.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.920
Craig, how could you?

12:27.007 --> 12:28.835
JOE: Get away from me,
you animals!

12:28.922 --> 12:31.838
Oh, my God. Joe.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.710
[Joe grunting]

12:34.797 --> 12:35.842
Stop!

12:35.929 --> 12:37.060
Stay out of this, Lois.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.845
This is retail justice.

12:38.932 --> 12:39.976
Pull it off.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.283
But you're making a mistake.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.327
Joe isn't the snitch!

12:43.414 --> 12:44.764
What?!

12:44.851 --> 12:47.723
The real snitch
just confessed to me.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.420
-Who is it?
-I'm not going to tell you.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.074
I don't want you hurting him.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.902
He's a misguided, weak,
pathetic individual who...

12:52.989 --> 12:55.383
-It's Craig!
-[clamoring]

12:55.470 --> 12:57.124
Wait!

12:59.648 --> 13:03.608
DEWEY:
Dad, why are you doing this?

13:03.695 --> 13:05.610
REESE:
We're gonna call child welfare,

13:05.697 --> 13:07.612
and this time they'll come!

13:11.616 --> 13:14.184
Please don't do this, Dad!
It's just not necessary.

13:14.271 --> 13:17.057
HAL:
There. Now we can finally

13:17.144 --> 13:20.277
have a nice,
safe weekend around here.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.193
Let's do it.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.419
I told you this was worth
spending Christmas vacation

13:31.506 --> 13:33.203
at Home Depot.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.510
Wait. Dad's gonna kill us
when he realizes we're gone.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.643
Maybe we can just pretend
we're too secure

13:38.730 --> 13:40.210
to care what the Schwabs
think of us.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.908
Nobody's gonna buy that.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.344
We can't let
this stand, Dewey.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.562
Remember the day
everybody started

13:44.649 --> 13:45.912
calling Booger Boy "Booger Boy"

13:45.999 --> 13:47.522
and he didn't
do anything about it?

13:47.609 --> 13:50.133
-What was his real name anyway?
-Nobody remembers.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.787
I'm in.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.722
[groans]

14:16.986 --> 14:18.031
Dad's under there!

14:18.118 --> 14:19.162
Oh, my God,
you're right!

14:19.249 --> 14:21.512
-Let's go.
-No, no, no.

14:27.954 --> 14:31.392
[whining]
You boys are in so much trouble.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.220
I'm calling Mom.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.699
Dad, are you okay?

14:34.786 --> 14:37.093
I can't feel anything
below my left knee.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.747
Is my foot okay?

14:38.834 --> 14:40.836
Your foot looks fine.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.492
But I think the rest of you
is facing the wrong way.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.496
I can't find him anywhere.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.976
Have you seen Craig?

14:50.063 --> 14:52.108
Nope.
So long, Lois.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.718
I'm off to the head office,

14:53.805 --> 14:55.590
a place where washing your hands
after using the restroom

14:55.677 --> 14:57.026
is a matter of personal choice.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.767
Good-bye, Joe.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.290
By the way, what did Cochran
give you to cover for me?

15:00.377 --> 15:01.857
What?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.511
You know, for throwing Craig
under the truck.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.252
Taking the heat off me.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.384
You really are Cochran's snitch?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.734
No, I'm getting kicked upstairs

15:09.821 --> 15:11.519
because of my skills
and motivation.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.042
But that's impossible.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.044
I saw Craig handing Cochran
a list of names.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.003
What?
Oh, those were probably names

15:17.090 --> 15:19.483
for that stupid surprise party
he's throwing for you.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.224
What are you talking about?

15:21.311 --> 15:22.791
Craig wanted to make a big deal

15:22.878 --> 15:24.401
out of your tenth anniversary
of working here.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.012
I told him it would just
depress you, but you know Craig.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.277
Cleanup in the storeroom.
[chuckles]

15:30.364 --> 15:32.192
Oh, my God.

15:33.584 --> 15:34.846
[gasps]
Craig!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.587
[muffled groaning]

15:36.674 --> 15:38.720
Oh, Craig...

15:38.807 --> 15:40.374
I'm so sorry.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.985
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning a party?

15:43.072 --> 15:44.508
You know?

15:44.595 --> 15:47.033
Oh, Lord, this day just keeps
getting worse.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.471
Oh, Craig, this is all my fault.
I feel just awful about this.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.168
I'll do whatever it takes
to make this up to you.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.387
-I'll even...
-[cell phone ringing]

15:53.474 --> 15:54.605
Oh, hold on a second.

15:55.693 --> 15:56.825
Hello.

15:56.912 --> 15:57.826
Mom, it's an emergency.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.306
You've gotta come quick!

15:59.393 --> 16:01.264
-Something horrible happened!
-[grunting]

16:01.351 --> 16:02.526
Hello? Dewey!

16:02.613 --> 16:03.963
Dewey!

16:04.050 --> 16:05.703
Lois, if you could just
get the ropes.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.792
My hands are wet.
I think my wrists are bleeding.

16:07.879 --> 16:08.924
I'll be right back.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.233
Party starts at 5:00.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.800
[grunting]

16:15.887 --> 16:18.412
See?
Better than new.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.066
That's not going to work, Dad.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.719
You really have to get
to the hospital.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.374
I can't go to the hospital!

16:24.461 --> 16:26.376
Nobody in this family can go
to the hospital.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.248
We've got no insurance!

16:28.335 --> 16:31.120
Why do you think I've been so
concerned about your safety?!

16:31.207 --> 16:32.948
Dad, it's not the end
of the world.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.080
Of course it is.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.778
Your mother will
never forgive me.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.956
This is worse than the time
I left Dewey in Mexico.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.829
This is unforgivable!

16:44.916 --> 16:47.267
I'm unforgivable.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.443
[sobbing]

16:49.530 --> 16:51.532
Wow.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.534
I didn't think Dad would get
this pathetic

16:53.621 --> 16:55.492
till we locked him
in a nursing home.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.321
This family deserves better
than me.

16:58.408 --> 17:01.368
[car approaches]

17:01.455 --> 17:03.239
Your mother's home, boys.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.632
Help me up.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.723
I raced home!

17:08.810 --> 17:10.029
What is it?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.290
Honey, there's something
you should know.

17:11.377 --> 17:14.032
Nine minutes
and 23 seconds. I win.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.471
What are you talking about?

17:17.558 --> 17:18.819
We made a bet to see
how quickly you could get here

17:18.906 --> 17:20.517
if you thought there
was an emergency.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.301
You don't win.
Reese said ten minutes.

17:22.388 --> 17:23.825
But you're not allowed
to go over.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.566
You can't decide that now.
That's cheating!

17:25.653 --> 17:26.958
You did what?!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.569
I don't blame you
for being mad, Mom.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.527
Reese underestimates you
all the time.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.355
This is just a game?!

17:32.442 --> 17:34.444
You made me race across town

17:34.531 --> 17:36.533
thinking one of you was dying
and it's just a game?!

17:36.620 --> 17:38.622
We got bored. There's not much
to do around here.

17:38.709 --> 17:39.971
DEWEY:
Yeah, maybe if you

17:40.059 --> 17:41.973
took us on a trip
once in a while...

17:42.061 --> 17:42.974
Hal, do you hear this?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.499
Ooh! I'm on it, Lois.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.327
I can't believe that...

17:47.414 --> 17:48.763
Hal, are you crying?

17:48.850 --> 17:50.678
With rage!

17:50.765 --> 17:52.288
You know how mad I get

17:52.375 --> 17:53.681
when these boys
pull stunts like this.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.379
There's something fishy
about this.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.947
Fishy is a nice way
to put it, Lois.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.905
They are gonna get
the grounding of their life.

18:00.992 --> 18:04.170
They are gonna feel
the full brunt of my wrath.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.525
Oh, I've been wrong
about so much lately

18:11.612 --> 18:13.527
I don't even trust my own radar.

18:13.614 --> 18:14.832
I got to get back to work.

18:14.919 --> 18:15.964
You start the punishment, Hal,

18:16.051 --> 18:18.271
but leave some for me.

18:18.358 --> 18:21.839
Drive safely.

[whimpering]

18:27.715 --> 18:28.716
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.587
It's a very special moment

18:30.674 --> 18:34.374
when a father watches his boys
lie to their mother for him.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.377
There's only one thing that
could make me prouder.

18:37.464 --> 18:41.207
If one of you
could saw off my leg.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.512
Don't worry, Dad.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.992
We'll get your knee
taken care of.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.125
I told you:
we have no medical insurance.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.082
There's no way.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.824
Dad, this is what we do.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.831
Happy anniversary, Lois.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.615
I chewed
through my ropes

18:58.702 --> 19:00.617
so I could have this set up
for you before you got back.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.315
Oh, Craig.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.360
I invited the entire staff,
but I guess they didn't show up,

19:04.447 --> 19:06.319
on account of seeing me
as human garbage.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.234
I wish you'd be mad at me.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.932
Yell at me, tell me
I'm a horrible person. Please!

19:11.019 --> 19:12.934
Don't apologize, Lois.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.501
If you want to make
me happy,

19:14.588 --> 19:17.808
just sit down
and enjoy your party.
