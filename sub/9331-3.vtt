00:08.179 --> 00:09.310
So, uh, what are
we gonna be doing

00:09.310 --> 00:10.681
on our first
official date tonight?

00:10.681 --> 00:12.513
Oh, that I can't tell you.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.714
-'Cause you don't know?
-Not a clue.

00:15.546 --> 00:16.947
But I do know
it's going to be...

00:16.947 --> 00:18.189
-Romantic?
-Yes, and...

00:18.189 --> 00:19.220
-Magical?
-Yes, and...

00:19.220 --> 00:20.451
Like a fairytale storybook?

00:20.451 --> 00:22.553
Yes.

00:22.553 --> 00:24.295
And unforgettable,
just like you.

00:24.295 --> 00:25.456
Oh!

00:26.497 --> 00:27.658
Ew.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.463
You guys are really together?

00:32.463 --> 00:34.335
Suddenly, I'm not
feeling very well.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.267
Is it okay with you
if I work from home?

00:36.267 --> 00:38.669
Forever?

00:38.669 --> 00:41.212
God, I can't believe I have to
wait all the way until dinner
to see you again.

00:41.212 --> 00:42.843
I know.
I don't want you to go.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.014
How do I say bye to you?

00:44.014 --> 00:45.846
Like this. Byeee!

00:46.977 --> 00:47.948
Elliot!

00:48.949 --> 00:50.081
Hi. Is it time
for our date yet?

00:50.081 --> 00:51.282
I know.
I miss you so much.

00:52.523 --> 00:53.524
Bye.

00:54.885 --> 00:56.987
You know, I imagined
what you two would be like

00:56.987 --> 00:58.389
-after you got together...
-(phone beeps)

00:59.660 --> 01:01.732
She just sent me a picture
of two sea otters holding hands.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.396
...and this is so much worse.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.140
I'm gonna send her a pic
of two kittens sleeping
in a coffee cup.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.175
Good morning!

01:14.175 --> 01:15.606
It's about time
you got here.

01:15.606 --> 01:18.909
I've been dying
to find out who would
possibly send you flowers.

01:20.311 --> 01:22.253
I got flowers?

01:22.253 --> 01:24.515

Love, Dominick."

01:28.959 --> 01:30.161
(chuckles)

01:30.161 --> 01:32.293
Shouldn't that read "Domino's"?

01:35.396 --> 01:37.998
Wait a minute, we've been
hooking up for a month already?

01:39.230 --> 01:41.902

I thought I was late!

(gasps)

01:44.275 --> 01:45.376
Out of my way, Elliot.

01:45.376 --> 01:46.637
I gotta get me
a pregnancy test.

01:46.637 --> 01:47.808
(laughs)

01:54.345 --> 01:55.816
What the hell is so funny?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.818
You? Pregnant?

01:57.818 --> 02:00.321
Please. The only eggs
in you are Cadbury.

02:02.753 --> 02:06.026
All I know is
I have never felt younger

02:06.026 --> 02:08.229
or looked better...

02:08.229 --> 02:10.831
and son of a bitch,
it got me pregnant!

02:45.836 --> 02:47.338
Uh, I just got back
from Coachella.

02:47.338 --> 02:49.570
Jake said to drop off
the food truck keys here.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.971
Oh. Well, set them
down anywhere.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.072
Kind of got my hands full.

Pregnancy test?

03:07.788 --> 03:08.959
while I wait for the results

03:08.959 --> 03:10.621
just so I won't freak out.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.425
Jake and I hooked up
at Coachella.

03:14.425 --> 03:17.698
Ooh, you hooked up
with Josh's brother?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.530
That's a good story.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.701
Keep going.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.333
No, you know,
at first, I thought,

03:22.333 --> 03:24.004
"This is Gabi's ex.
Maybe I shouldn't do this,"

03:24.004 --> 03:26.206
but before I could make
a list of pros and cons,

03:26.206 --> 03:27.678
I was half naked.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.881
Mm! Have you told Gabi?

03:30.881 --> 03:32.082
Not yet.

03:32.082 --> 03:33.183
What do you think
she'll say?

03:33.183 --> 03:34.144
(screams)

03:35.286 --> 03:37.788
-That bad?
-A plus sign!

03:37.788 --> 03:38.889
(groans)

03:38.889 --> 03:40.691
Oh, my damn!
(gasps)

03:40.691 --> 03:42.022
I'm gonna be a mom again!

03:42.022 --> 03:44.154
-(gasps)
-Or...

03:44.154 --> 03:47.358
Yolanda, I think you grabbed
the wrong box.

03:47.358 --> 03:49.029
This is a menopause test.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.304
What?

03:54.765 --> 03:56.907
They don't make tests
for menopause!

03:58.008 --> 03:59.940
Oh, "Test for menopause."

04:01.672 --> 04:03.774
I must have grabbed
the wrong box at the pharmacy.

04:03.774 --> 04:07.117
But you're not pregnant,
so yay!

04:07.117 --> 04:08.379
No yay!

04:09.620 --> 04:11.352
I don't want to
be in menopause!

04:11.352 --> 04:13.183
-That means I'm an old lady.
-Oh...

04:13.183 --> 04:14.485
And my life is over!

04:16.327 --> 04:17.858
What is all this
screaming about?

04:17.858 --> 04:21.292
You didn't actually waste
your money on that test?

04:21.292 --> 04:22.563
This is ridiculous.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.795
Actually, Yolanda just
found out she's--

04:24.795 --> 04:25.936
Pregnant!

04:25.936 --> 04:28.068
Yes, it's--

04:28.068 --> 04:29.440
that's right, honey.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.402
There's a bun in this oven.

04:32.803 --> 04:34.345
Oh, my God!

04:34.345 --> 04:35.776
You're gonna get even bigger?

04:43.213 --> 04:44.815
Hey, Gabi.

04:44.815 --> 04:45.956
Hey!

04:45.956 --> 04:46.987
Wow!

04:46.987 --> 04:49.820
That dress deserves
a two-syllable "dayum"!

04:49.820 --> 04:51.261
(laughs)

04:51.261 --> 04:53.263
Oh, I missed you.

04:53.263 --> 04:54.695
Thank you so much
for driving the truck

04:54.695 --> 04:55.726
back with Jake.

04:55.726 --> 04:56.997
You're a good friend.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.800
Am I?

05:01.031 --> 05:02.272
The best.

05:02.272 --> 05:04.204
Hey, can I borrow
your new black shoes?

05:04.204 --> 05:05.636
Uh, yes!

05:05.636 --> 05:06.977
You don't have to
ask my permission.

05:06.977 --> 05:09.680
What's mine is yours
and yours is mine.
(clears throat)

05:11.712 --> 05:12.743
Since when?

05:12.743 --> 05:14.715
Since I love you!

05:16.286 --> 05:20.120
So tell me about
last night with Josh.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.222
Well, we drove
all through the night,

05:22.222 --> 05:24.625
and by the time
we got to his bed...

05:24.625 --> 05:25.826
-Yeah?
-...we passed out.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.628
So, in the morning...

05:27.628 --> 05:31.001
-Yeah?
-...we decided not to do it
and to wait till tonight.

05:31.001 --> 05:33.163
You still haven't
slept together?

05:33.163 --> 05:35.666
Sofia, Josh is
taking his time

05:35.666 --> 05:37.207
because he's really
serious about me,

05:37.207 --> 05:40.070
which is great
because I'm really
serious about him.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.912
And what have
I always wanted, Sofia?

05:41.912 --> 05:44.014
-Uh...
-That's right.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.347
A storybook romance,
and that's what this is,

05:47.347 --> 05:48.749
a storybook romance.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.751
And you want to know
what I realized, Sofia?

05:50.751 --> 05:51.952
Uh...

05:51.952 --> 05:53.884
That's right.

05:53.884 --> 05:56.757
Everything that's happened
has happened for a reason.

05:56.757 --> 06:01.361
I mean, Caroline, Cooper,
China, Switzerland,
Jake, Coachella--

06:01.361 --> 06:02.793
I mean, so many near misses,

06:02.793 --> 06:04.795
so many miscommunications.

06:04.795 --> 06:06.336
It's all led up till tonight...

06:06.336 --> 06:07.768
(whispers)
and tonight is
gonna be perfect.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.901
Well, at least
there's no pressure.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.580
(jazz music playing)

06:21.251 --> 06:22.983
Okay, this is
the most perfect date

06:22.983 --> 06:24.084
anyone's ever taken me on.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.986
Oh, Gabi, it's just dinner...

06:27.217 --> 06:28.288
at the chef's table

06:28.288 --> 06:29.590
at the hottest
restaurant in town.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.962
Oh, my God,
this is the chef's table?

06:31.962 --> 06:33.624
Okay, this is
Bachelor level impressive.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.225
It is, isn't it?

06:35.225 --> 06:36.697
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.669
I told you I'm gonna
give you the perfect night.

06:38.669 --> 06:41.231
Oh, you're so good
at planning,

06:41.231 --> 06:44.435
and kissing,
and smiling--

06:44.435 --> 06:46.276
Oh! Show me those cute
baby dinosaur teeth.

06:48.238 --> 06:49.880
Oh, there they are!

06:49.880 --> 06:51.081
I love them!

06:51.081 --> 06:52.282
And I love this restaurant.

06:52.282 --> 06:54.114
How did you know I've been
dying to go to Molecule?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.416
Well, molecular gastronomy
blends food and technology,

06:56.416 --> 06:59.089
so if you think about it,
it's kind of like the Gabi
and Josh of restaurants.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.090
It totally is.

07:00.090 --> 07:01.391
Oh!

07:01.391 --> 07:03.724
Jane! Gloves on
when pouring nitrogen.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.457
You don't want to
lost another finger.

07:06.457 --> 07:08.699
Oh, my God.
That's the chef!

07:08.699 --> 07:09.700
Really?

07:10.761 --> 07:12.563
Sounded less chiseled
on the phone.

07:12.563 --> 07:15.435
Hello and welcome to Molecule.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.637
-I'm...
-Chef Hunter.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.168
Yes, I know
everything about you.

07:18.168 --> 07:21.111
You are singularly
responsible for bringing

07:21.111 --> 07:23.474
molecular gastronomy
to San Francisco.

07:23.474 --> 07:24.975
As I mentioned on the phone,
Gabi is a chef.

07:24.975 --> 07:25.976
And a huge fan.

07:25.976 --> 07:28.649
Well, Chef Gabi,
I hope you're a fan of this.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.850
(gasps)

07:31.281 --> 07:34.154
-It's dehydrated duck breast
infused with Maraschino jam...
-Mmm.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.087
...and served on a cloud
of jalapeño foam.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.760
Oh, my God.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.764
The way the flavor mingles
with the texture, it's unreal.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.466
And my foam cloud is...

07:47.938 --> 07:49.540
on its way?

07:49.540 --> 07:52.172
Sorry, that was just
from one chef to another.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.704
Oh. (scoffs) Cool.

07:53.704 --> 07:55.205
Cool, cool, cool.

07:55.205 --> 07:56.647
Hey, um, do you have anything

07:56.647 --> 07:58.849
from one chef to the guy
who is paying for everything?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.457
The molecular gastronomy
is very cerebral.

08:07.457 --> 08:09.820
I still believe you have to
get your hands dirty,

08:09.820 --> 08:11.962
so I personally source
all of our ingredients...

08:11.962 --> 08:13.163
(snorts)

08:13.163 --> 08:15.365
...and grind my own peppercorn
with a mortar and pestle.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.368
Amazing.

08:19.429 --> 08:22.032
And the earth
in our organic garden,

08:22.032 --> 08:23.534
I till it myself.

08:25.035 --> 08:26.106
Wow.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.608
Can't wait
"till" the check comes.

08:29.279 --> 08:32.212
Say, Chef, would you like
a tour of my kitchen?

08:32.212 --> 08:33.544
Oh, my God!
Yes, yes!

08:33.544 --> 08:35.045
Um, hey, Josh,
do you wanna go?

08:35.045 --> 08:37.217
Actually, my kitchen's
my laboratory.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.849
There's only one guest
allowed at a time.

08:38.849 --> 08:40.250
(laughs) Right.
Cool, cool, cool.

08:41.752 --> 08:42.993
Um... is that okay, Josh?

08:42.993 --> 08:45.325
Of course. Go.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.757
It's all part of
the perfect night.

08:46.757 --> 08:48.699
-Okay.
-Don't worry.
She'll be in good hands.

08:48.699 --> 08:49.700
(squeals)

08:49.700 --> 08:52.162
-(cooing)
-Oh, shoot! Is that bird?

08:52.162 --> 08:53.503
Oh, my God.

08:53.503 --> 08:54.565
It's coming this way!

08:54.565 --> 08:55.606
I'll protect you, Gabi.

08:55.606 --> 08:57.037
No, I will.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.538
-(thud)
-(wings flapping)

08:58.538 --> 09:00.771
-(thump)
-(bird cries)

09:02.442 --> 09:03.774
It's okay, folks.

09:03.774 --> 09:05.946
Everything's under control.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.148
Oh, my God,
did you just punch a bird?

09:09.319 --> 09:11.652
You're safe now, Gabi.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.854
Nothing's gonna ruin this night.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.085
Oh, ya wanna bet?

09:19.590 --> 09:20.931
Oh, my God.

09:20.931 --> 09:22.693
I can't believe
you killed a bird!

09:22.693 --> 09:24.094
I didn't mean to!

09:24.094 --> 09:25.235
I was just protecting you.

09:25.235 --> 09:26.396
From a five-inch bird?

09:26.396 --> 09:28.068
It was coming at your face!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.439
At your beautiful face!

09:29.439 --> 09:31.802
And now he's dead.

09:31.802 --> 09:33.774
But...

09:33.774 --> 09:36.446
but your face is
still so pretty.

09:36.446 --> 09:37.848
Josh, no.
You don't get it.

09:37.848 --> 09:38.879
This was the night!

09:38.879 --> 09:40.580
This was supposed to
be our perfect date!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.152
You know, the story
we tell everybody

09:42.152 --> 09:45.115
and obnoxiously post on Facebook
every year on our anniversary.

09:45.115 --> 09:47.057
But now we can't,
because it's ruined!

09:47.057 --> 09:48.318
(cooing)

09:51.091 --> 09:52.723
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?

09:52.723 --> 09:53.724
Yes, I did.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.627
-(wings flapping)
-Okay, he's moving.

09:56.627 --> 09:58.028
He's hurt, but he's moving!

09:58.028 --> 09:59.429
And you know
what this means?

09:59.429 --> 10:01.632
Our night is not ruined
because this isn't the night

10:01.632 --> 10:03.073
that I killed a bird--
this is the night

10:03.073 --> 10:05.135
that I saved a bird,
and you and I finally had sex.

10:05.135 --> 10:06.777
That last part
I shouldn't have said.
To the vet!

10:16.616 --> 10:18.689
"Welcome to menopause,

10:18.689 --> 10:21.121
an exciting new chapter
in your life."

10:21.121 --> 10:22.422
(chuckles)

10:22.422 --> 10:23.794
Bitch, please.

10:23.794 --> 10:24.795
(door opens)

10:27.257 --> 10:29.129
Hi, Yolanda.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.431
Listen, I was thinking
about your situation,

10:31.431 --> 10:34.134
and I feel like I might have
been a little insensitive.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.605
I mean, think about it.

10:35.605 --> 10:37.237
By the time
this kid's out of diapers,

10:37.237 --> 10:38.238
you're going to be in 'em.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.141
I'm sorry.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.673
I'm so bad at this.

10:42.673 --> 10:44.014
I really am trying
to be nice.

10:45.175 --> 10:46.947
Well-- well, don't bother.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.548
I-- I have something
I have to tell you.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.780
Wait, there's more.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.151
I brought you cookies...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.483
-and ice cream...
-Oh.

10:53.483 --> 10:56.857
...and pillows,
and fancy slippers.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.558
(gasps)
Oh! Fancy slippers!

11:00.090 --> 11:01.932
-Yeah, try them on.
-Oh!

11:01.932 --> 11:03.663
It's like walking
on cotton balls.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.335
Oh, my damn!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.969
-You like?
-I love!

11:08.969 --> 11:10.140
Good.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.241
Now, what did
you want to tell me?

11:12.502 --> 11:15.075
(stammering)
Uh... I think I just
felt a little kick.

11:18.849 --> 11:20.010
(gasps)

11:24.514 --> 11:26.586
Hi. This bird needs help.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.789
He's still breathing,
but he needs to see
the vet right away.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.390
Okay.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.661
What exactly happened?

11:31.661 --> 11:33.293
He got punched.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.066
Or lightly shooed.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.667
Regardless, we need
your top men on this.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.099
It is paramount
that this bird lives.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.600
All lives matter.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.473
I'll take him back.

11:43.473 --> 11:44.504
Have a seat.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.506
And money's no object!

11:46.506 --> 11:49.409
I'll do whatever it takes
to save this night-- bird.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.540
Night bird.

11:50.540 --> 11:51.541
Gonna sit.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.887
(meowing)

11:56.887 --> 11:58.548
So, I'm feeling
pretty good about this.

11:58.548 --> 11:59.790
How are you feeling?

11:59.790 --> 12:02.722
Um, could we maybe just not talk
until we know how the bird is?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.154
Absolutely.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.458
Out of curiosity...

12:09.659 --> 12:11.561
would you say that
you're mad at me

12:11.561 --> 12:14.364
or mad at the situation?

12:16.066 --> 12:17.067
Both.

12:18.408 --> 12:19.439
Both?

12:19.439 --> 12:22.342
Yeah. This whole thing
is all your fault.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.244
All my fault?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.976
Oh...

12:25.976 --> 12:27.948
so you don't think you had
anything to do with this?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.449
No!

12:29.449 --> 12:30.981
Well, let me tell you somethin'.

12:30.981 --> 12:32.152
Ya did.

12:33.483 --> 12:34.985
If you weren't fawning
all over that chef,

12:34.985 --> 12:36.827
I wouldn't have needed
to protect you before he did.

12:36.827 --> 12:39.289
"Fawning"?
I was not fawning, okay?

12:39.289 --> 12:41.631
And what do you mean
"before he did"?

12:41.631 --> 12:43.463
Oh, my God,
were you jealous?

12:43.463 --> 12:44.564
No!

12:44.564 --> 12:46.066
But if I was, it was
because I was put

12:46.066 --> 12:47.397
in the position
of being jealous

12:47.397 --> 12:49.539
by you and your fawning.

12:49.539 --> 12:50.871
I wasn't fawning!

12:50.871 --> 12:53.443
I was being respectful
of a chef and his restaurant,

12:53.443 --> 12:54.905
which you took me to!

12:54.905 --> 12:55.946
Yes!

12:55.946 --> 12:57.948
To give you that
perfect storybook night!

12:57.948 --> 12:59.709
Remember?
Baby dinosaur teeth?

13:01.711 --> 13:02.712
Receptionist:
Yoo-hoo...

13:04.855 --> 13:07.517
The doctors just informed me
that unfortunately,

13:07.517 --> 13:09.719
we don't treat
wild animals here.

13:09.719 --> 13:10.991
Excuse me?

13:10.991 --> 13:15.966
I'm sorry,
you don't treat animals
in an animal hospital?

13:15.966 --> 13:19.799
Oh, my 12 Twitter followers are
gonna get an earful about this.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.432
Okay, so,
what are our options?

13:22.432 --> 13:25.505
We can give you
some home care instructions.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.536
Great!

13:26.536 --> 13:28.238
We'll take the bird home!

13:28.238 --> 13:29.910
"We"? No, there is no "we."

13:29.910 --> 13:30.981
You've done enough.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.642
I will take him home. Alone.

13:36.746 --> 13:37.747
Can't leave the bird.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.696
Hey, Jake.

13:46.696 --> 13:48.598
No, I haven't told Gabi yet.

13:48.598 --> 13:49.930
She's out with Josh, okay?

13:49.930 --> 13:51.131
So, I'm just gonna
tell her tomorrow

13:51.131 --> 13:52.933
when she's all happy
from her magical--

13:52.933 --> 13:54.764
Freaking disaster, Sofia.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.668
Okay, I'll call
you back, Abuelita.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.172
Worst date ever.

14:02.172 --> 14:03.473
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:03.473 --> 14:05.976
But at least
there's leftovers...

14:05.976 --> 14:07.247
(gasps)

14:07.247 --> 14:08.378
That's a bird!

14:08.378 --> 14:09.379
Uh-huh.

14:09.379 --> 14:11.421
Oh. Well, I guess
you have a story.

14:11.421 --> 14:13.053
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, there's a story.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.286
But it doesn't matter
because I had this amazing dream

14:16.286 --> 14:19.129
about how tonight was gonna go
and it went the exact opposite.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.091
I knew this was
gonna happen, Gabi.

14:21.091 --> 14:24.194
You just put so much pressure
on this one date.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.036
No, it wasn't just one date!

14:26.036 --> 14:27.367
It was "the" date,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.369
and I wanted it to be perfect.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.741
God, why does everybody
always disappoint me?

14:34.704 --> 14:36.546
Because that's life, Gabi.

14:36.546 --> 14:37.707
People disappoint.

14:37.707 --> 14:40.050
They-- they don't mean to,
but it happens,

14:40.050 --> 14:41.251
and you forgive them.

14:42.612 --> 14:44.084
Well, you don't disappoint.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.086
(sighs)
Are you kidding me?

14:46.086 --> 14:47.787
I disappoint people
all the time.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.689
-Not me.
-Yes, you!

14:49.689 --> 14:51.091
Like...

14:54.294 --> 14:56.196
If I slept with Jake...
(scoffs)

14:56.196 --> 15:00.070
and, um, and I didn't tell you,
and I told Yolanda first,

15:00.070 --> 15:03.433
and then you found out,
you'd be pretty disappointed,
wouldn't you?

15:03.433 --> 15:06.937
That's the stupidest example
I've ever heard.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.339
Is it?

15:10.680 --> 15:12.112
Oh, my God,
you slept with Jake?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.184
At Coachella after you left.

15:14.184 --> 15:15.785
And I know I should have
asked you first,

15:15.785 --> 15:17.617
(groans)
but I didn't.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.149
I can't believe this.

15:19.149 --> 15:21.551
I just got broken up with,
and he did too,

15:21.551 --> 15:23.253
and we were both
feeling so lonely

15:23.253 --> 15:24.694
and rejected.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.027
I'm sorry.

15:28.398 --> 15:30.400
-But I bet you're
pretty disappointed, aren't you?
-Oh, yeah!

15:30.400 --> 15:31.761
Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed!

15:31.761 --> 15:33.533
This is horrible what you did!

15:33.533 --> 15:36.206
I mean, sleeping with a guy
that I almost slept with

15:36.206 --> 15:38.938
and then hiding it from me
and then telling Yolanda first?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.510
I mean, where does
the betrayal end?

15:41.641 --> 15:42.742
Exactly!

15:42.742 --> 15:44.744
I-- I disappointed
the hell out of you!

15:44.744 --> 15:46.846
But now,
you're gonna forgive me

15:46.846 --> 15:48.478
and tell me
that you still love me.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.780
Am I?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.623
Yes, you are.

15:53.623 --> 15:54.754
Because you have to let

15:54.754 --> 15:56.926
all of this
fairytale stuff go, Gabi.

15:56.926 --> 15:58.758
Life isn't a fairytale.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.590
Nothing's perfect.

16:00.590 --> 16:01.661
Nobody's perfect.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.993
First dates aren't perfect,

16:02.993 --> 16:05.095
life is just messy
and complicated, and--

16:05.095 --> 16:06.136
Okay, I forgive you.

16:06.136 --> 16:07.667
You do?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.938
Yeah, I do.

16:11.001 --> 16:14.944
Well, then why can't you forgive
Josh for disappointing you?

16:14.944 --> 16:16.546
'Cause I'm not perfect!

16:23.183 --> 16:25.515
Well, it's over.

16:25.515 --> 16:27.057
Gabi and I got
into a huge fight.

16:27.057 --> 16:30.060
Ha. You wanna talk over?

16:30.060 --> 16:31.991
I've been sleeping
with the doorman,

16:31.991 --> 16:33.163
thought I was pregnant,

16:33.163 --> 16:35.495
and just found out
I'm in menopause.

16:38.168 --> 16:39.669
Okay, we're tied.
Start pouring.

16:40.830 --> 16:42.872
-All right, so what'd you do?
-Me? Nothing.

16:42.872 --> 16:44.434
I punched a bird.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.176
(chuckles)

16:46.176 --> 16:47.337
I am getting old.

16:47.337 --> 16:48.938
I've never even heard
of that position.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.082
It's not a sexual
thing, Yolanda.

16:52.082 --> 16:54.584
I physically punched a bird,
and I feel horrible about it.

16:54.584 --> 16:57.617
I needed to protect Gabi before
that good-looking chef did.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.950
Oh, so you felt threatened
by the hot chef,

17:00.950 --> 17:03.493
and you acted like
a damn immature jealous fool.

17:05.395 --> 17:07.627
Sorry. I can say whatever
the hell I want to now.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.898
I'm in menopause!

17:11.201 --> 17:12.862
All I know is that
Gabi and I have been trying

17:12.862 --> 17:15.465
to make this work
for so long, but...

17:15.465 --> 17:18.138
it doesn't look like
we're gonna get the happily-
ever-after we wanted.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.540
Guess you're not.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.741
What?

17:21.741 --> 17:23.313
It was good while it lasted.

17:23.313 --> 17:24.744
It's over.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.247
All good things got to
come to an end, boo.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.321
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

17:31.321 --> 17:32.682
Where's my pep talk?

17:32.682 --> 17:33.883
Oh, please.

17:33.883 --> 17:36.055
I got no pep left.
My pep is gone.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.387
Just like my eggs.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.030
My life is over.

17:41.030 --> 17:43.062
Yolanda, that's ridiculous!

17:43.062 --> 17:44.664
Just because
you're starting menopause

17:44.664 --> 17:46.065
doesn't mean
your life's over!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.167
Nothing's changed!

17:47.167 --> 17:49.068
It's called "The Change."

17:50.440 --> 17:52.572
So, you're just gonna give up?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.905
You are still the same
beautiful, vibrant woman
that you were yesterday.

17:55.905 --> 17:57.447
Am I?

17:57.447 --> 17:59.309
Are there not flowers
from the doorman

17:59.309 --> 18:00.980
sitting right there?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.152
Yes.

18:02.152 --> 18:03.553
And does he want
to see you again?

18:03.553 --> 18:05.014
Yes.

18:06.516 --> 18:08.057
So, it sounds like
the only thing that

18:08.057 --> 18:09.459
needs a change
is your little attitude.

18:11.961 --> 18:13.193
Mine?

18:13.193 --> 18:14.864
Who else is standing here? Oh.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.629
I see what you're doing.

18:19.629 --> 18:21.831
You're trying to say that
I need to change my attitude too

18:21.831 --> 18:23.133
and that I shouldn't give up.

18:23.133 --> 18:24.974
Well, guess what? I'm not.

18:24.974 --> 18:26.636
I'm gonna go to Gabi's
and tell her how I feel.

18:26.636 --> 18:29.139
-Thank you for the pep talk.
-(chuckles)

18:29.139 --> 18:30.610
You know I got you.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.143
Oh, and by the way,
uh, don't mention to Elliot

18:33.143 --> 18:35.315
that I'm in menopause
and not pregnant.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.318
He's at my house right now
setting up my massage recliner.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.319
(chuckles)

18:40.450 --> 18:42.552
And it's got a remote control!

18:45.725 --> 18:46.726
I'm an idiot.

18:47.957 --> 18:49.128
What?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.261
And that's okay,
'cause you are too.

18:52.962 --> 18:55.305
But that's all right,
because now I know

18:55.305 --> 18:58.768
that we're both not perfect
and we don't need to be anymore.

18:58.768 --> 19:00.510
Aw.

19:00.510 --> 19:01.871
That's almost nice?

19:01.871 --> 19:05.375
And almost is
good enough, right?

19:05.375 --> 19:07.777
Ugh, you have no idea how much
pressure this takes off me.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.720
What about your storybook?

19:10.720 --> 19:13.453
Can I tell you a little secret?

19:13.453 --> 19:15.024
I usually just skip to the end.

19:18.027 --> 19:20.360
-How's the bird?
-Oh, he's a lot better.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.991
He's been flapping his wings
a little bit.

19:21.991 --> 19:24.234
I think he's trying to tell me
he's ready to fly again.

19:24.234 --> 19:25.435
Like us.

19:27.297 --> 19:28.998
Should we take
him on my balcony
and set him free?

19:28.998 --> 19:30.340
I'd love that.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.203
You know, after this,
it's just gonna be
the two of us again.

19:33.203 --> 19:35.205
Maybe we'll finally get
that happy ending after all.

19:35.205 --> 19:36.276
I will-- we will.

19:37.907 --> 19:39.679
I just hope this little guy
can rise to the occasion.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.652
You too, little birdie.

19:46.656 --> 19:48.388
-Ow! Ow! Oh! Get off of me!
-(clattering)

19:50.990 --> 19:52.121
-(groans)
-Are you okay?

19:52.121 --> 19:54.764
Yeah. I think we're gonna need
to make one quick stop

19:54.764 --> 19:55.865
before the happy ending.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.026
-Emergency room?
-Yeah.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.500
Hey, uh, did you know that

20:00.500 --> 20:02.472
Sofia and your brother
are sleeping together?

20:02.472 --> 20:03.873
Really?

20:03.873 --> 20:05.705
Good for them.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.337
Everybody's sleeping
together but us.

20:14.944 --> 20:17.587
Mm-mm, don't mind if I do.

20:19.589 --> 20:20.920
(door rattles)

20:23.493 --> 20:25.495
Fine, I'll just eat
without a plate.

20:26.826 --> 20:27.827
(rattles)

20:28.958 --> 20:30.600
Come on!
I'm just trying
to get a fork!

20:31.701 --> 20:32.702
Having problems?

20:34.964 --> 20:36.766
Yeah. What's going on?

20:36.766 --> 20:38.868
I overheard you
talking to Josh.

20:38.868 --> 20:40.740
I know you're not pregnant.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.642
Oh. Uh, listen, I am sorry--

20:42.642 --> 20:43.713
It's okay.

20:43.713 --> 20:45.074
I'm not mad.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.218
You're not? Why?

20:49.218 --> 20:52.151
'Cause I baby-proofed
everything you love.

20:54.524 --> 20:55.925
Good luck, bitch!

20:58.888 --> 21:01.761
Oh, please. You think
I need a fork to eat cake?

21:01.761 --> 21:02.992
Come on!

21:06.065 --> 21:08.197
No-oooo!

21:08.197 --> 21:09.769
(laughs)
