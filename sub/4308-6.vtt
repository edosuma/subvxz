WEBVTT

00:11.043 --> 00:12.898
Man: What did you do
after you strangled her?

00:14.948 --> 00:17.882
Daniel:
I went and got some flowers.

00:19.205 --> 00:20.831
Man:
Some flowers?

00:22.596 --> 00:24.287
Daniel:
Wildflowers.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.397
Jacob's Ladder.

00:26.436 --> 00:28.411
Man:
Come again?

00:29.605 --> 00:31.613
Daniel:
It's a wildflower.

00:32.998 --> 00:34.973
Man:
And then what did you do?

00:38.438 --> 00:40.380
Daniel:
I put the flowers in her hair.

00:43.654 --> 00:45.346
Man:
Was she naked?

00:46.343 --> 00:48.677
Daniel:
Um, yes, she was naked.

00:50.854 --> 00:54.083
Man:
And how did she get unclothed?

00:55.943 --> 00:57.635
Daniel:
I had taken her clothes off.

00:58.631 --> 01:00.387
Man:
Before?

01:00.424 --> 01:02.529
Daniel:
Before?

01:02.567 --> 01:04.422
Man:
Yes, before.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.495
You took her clothes off before.

01:10.952 --> 01:12.229
Daniel:
Before I raped her.

01:15.112 --> 01:17.087
(gasps)

01:24.809 --> 01:26.533
Man:
What'd you do then, Daniel?

01:28.297 --> 01:29.824
Daniel:
I sat with her.

01:29.865 --> 01:32.865
(sniffs)

01:32.906 --> 01:34.662
Man:
You sat with her?

01:35.691 --> 01:38.440
Daniel: Yes, I sat with her
and held her hand.

01:40.682 --> 01:42.243
Man:
Why'd you hold her hand, son?

01:42.282 --> 01:45.544
Daniel: It didn't seem right
to leave her alone.

01:45.578 --> 01:47.433
Man:
Why not?

01:47.467 --> 01:49.889
Daniel:
She seemed so real.

01:49.931 --> 01:51.590
Man:
Real?

01:51.628 --> 01:53.254
What do you mean, real?

01:54.988 --> 01:56.930
Daniel:
Alive.

01:56.972 --> 01:59.143

02:25.774 --> 02:27.662
(country music playing)

02:53.521 --> 02:55.309
One?

02:58.161 --> 03:00.233
(chair squeaks)

03:15.313 --> 03:17.965
Do you still have the...

03:18.002 --> 03:19.693
Wildcat special?

03:20.659 --> 03:23.790
No, the country fried steak.

03:23.827 --> 03:25.420
Biscuits?

03:25.459 --> 03:26.703
Please.

03:26.738 --> 03:28.811
To drink?

03:28.850 --> 03:30.924
Water. Just water.

03:53.653 --> 03:55.147
Thank you.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.897
Marcy, I'm not going
till he goes.

04:18.934 --> 04:20.844
It's all right, Bill.
Jimmy's staying.

04:23.672 --> 04:25.744
- You sure?
- Yeah.

04:25.784 --> 04:27.726
- It's all right.
- All right.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.023
Could I have another, please?

04:43.065 --> 04:45.650
The cook's gone home.

04:50.298 --> 04:53.167
I've got some
leftover fried chicken.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.697
I was just gonna take it home.

04:55.738 --> 04:57.625
I can pay.

04:58.713 --> 05:00.689
I don't charge for leftovers.

05:12.539 --> 05:14.841
Hey, Daniel.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.501
Hello, Ted.

05:16.539 --> 05:18.961
Your mom made
a fresh pecan pie.

05:19.004 --> 05:21.044
It's on the counter.

05:45.918 --> 05:47.227
Everything go okay tonight?

05:51.839 --> 05:54.228
I'm not pretending
to be more than I am,

05:54.271 --> 05:56.343
but if you ever need to talk...

06:01.631 --> 06:03.420
Okay.

06:09.247 --> 06:11.549
You found the pie.

06:11.584 --> 06:13.656
(loud bang)

06:25.345 --> 06:28.028
Is he the bomb squad?

06:28.065 --> 06:31.033
(engines start)

06:35.265 --> 06:36.826
It's just kids playing a prank.

06:36.866 --> 06:38.906
Loud prank.

06:38.945 --> 06:41.084
These things can make some noise
and do some damage,

06:41.121 --> 06:43.675
but it's pretty primitive, really.

06:43.714 --> 06:46.878
Now I'm not saying it wasn't
connected to all that's going on...

06:46.915 --> 06:49.370
What all is going on?

06:52.290 --> 06:54.364
If somebody wanted to do
real damage, they would have.

06:54.404 --> 06:57.371
- You know?
- No, we don't know.

06:57.412 --> 07:00.411
Maybe you could give us
an example or five

07:00.452 --> 07:02.841
so we could at least
try and prepare.

07:05.060 --> 07:07.297
Look, we don't want anybody hurt,

07:07.333 --> 07:08.707
but we can't be everywhere at once.

07:08.741 --> 07:10.595
We understand that, Carl,

07:10.628 --> 07:12.897
but is there any way you can
get more patrols in this area?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.650
(sighs)
We'll do what we can, Ted, but...

07:20.422 --> 07:23.007
If you got something to say,
say it.

07:23.973 --> 07:26.755
Him being here stirs up things.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.579
Where's he supposed to go, Sheriff?

07:28.614 --> 07:31.200
He's only lived two places
his whole life.

07:31.238 --> 07:35.167
Somewhere besides here, ma'am.
For his safety and yours.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.483
Like you care about that.

07:36.518 --> 07:38.940
My personal feelings
have nothing to do with it.

07:38.982 --> 07:40.509
You believe that? Really?

07:40.550 --> 07:42.655
- You self-deluded ass.
- Amantha.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.604
Wouldn't be so sure
who's deluded, ma'am.

07:44.646 --> 07:46.949
What?
I'm sorry, what did you say?

07:46.984 --> 07:48.478
You son of a bitch.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.014
We're more scared of you
than some lynch mob.

07:50.055 --> 07:52.194
You are the lynch mob.
And you know what?

07:52.231 --> 07:54.239
Next time you mess with me
on a public street,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.963
I will make a citizen's arrest.
You hear me?

08:25.099 --> 08:26.887
Everything okay?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.385
Yeah.

08:28.427 --> 08:30.467
Just had an accident.

08:30.507 --> 08:32.448
Oh.

08:37.772 --> 08:41.187
- Well, hotel food can be...
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:45.516 --> 08:47.687
Make you breakfast?

08:47.724 --> 08:49.928
Okay.

08:55.757 --> 08:57.545
Poach your eggs?

08:57.581 --> 08:59.369
What?

08:59.405 --> 09:02.308
Poach your eggs?
Better on your stomach.

09:02.349 --> 09:04.072
Sure.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.932
Okay.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.412
How was the baptism?

09:15.694 --> 09:17.701
It was fine.
It went fine.

09:17.743 --> 09:20.296
I guess he's saved now.

09:25.263 --> 09:27.051
I guess he is.

09:40.816 --> 09:43.238
(insects buzzing)

09:46.672 --> 09:48.461
Mama.

09:49.968 --> 09:51.659
I'm home.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.153
(panting)

10:47.990 --> 10:49.778
Kind of makes me miss
the good old days

10:49.814 --> 10:52.334
when it was just the Cro-Magnons
calling the house.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.377
It's not safe for him here.

11:00.406 --> 11:03.156
I know. I know.
I know.

11:05.687 --> 11:07.792
Guess I'll go to my...

11:08.919 --> 11:11.189
inspiring new apartment
and unpack.

11:13.816 --> 11:15.758
I don't know.

11:15.799 --> 11:18.188
I'll save the boxes.

11:18.231 --> 11:20.141
You jumped the gun?

11:20.184 --> 11:21.777
Don't I always?

11:21.815 --> 11:24.238
No.

11:24.281 --> 11:26.288
You usually face the gun,
Amantha.

11:26.328 --> 11:30.071
You always have
ever since you were a child.

11:32.601 --> 11:35.416
Mama, don't start talking like that.
You're freaking me out.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.867
Okay.

11:40.506 --> 11:41.935
Senator Foulkes is coming.

11:41.977 --> 11:43.832
Lenton, I believe you've lost a step.

11:43.865 --> 11:46.167
Been burning your candle
at both ends.

11:46.202 --> 11:48.690
Lenton, offer the senator
a refreshment.

11:48.731 --> 11:50.454
Just hydrated.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.986
- Have a seat.
- What's your problem, Miss Person?

11:57.019 --> 11:58.546
I'm sorry?

11:59.835 --> 12:01.264
Why the tight lips?

12:01.308 --> 12:03.697
- It's only been five days, Roland.
- Six.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.780
I'm reviewing the case.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.795
It's a bit more complicated now.

12:07.836 --> 12:09.330
Guess you heard about the mailbox.

12:09.371 --> 12:11.281
Word gets around.

12:11.324 --> 12:15.122
If we don't go after Holden
in an expeditious manner,

12:15.165 --> 12:18.132
most people around here are gonna
jump to one of two conclusions.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.955
Either I went after an innocent man,

12:20.988 --> 12:23.890
or you don't have the ovaries
to go after a guilty one.

12:23.932 --> 12:26.104
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let people

12:26.140 --> 12:28.410
start fantasizing
about my mailbox.

12:28.446 --> 12:31.512
I'm not so much worried about
my mailbox as I am about my house

12:31.549 --> 12:34.135
if I were to try
and lose a case like this.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.628
I'm not gonna rush in
without enough ammunition.

12:36.669 --> 12:39.059
We got two bullets
the size of bull balls.

12:39.103 --> 12:42.681
And that's more than enough to indict
with any grand jury of our choosing.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.147
We'll fill in the blanks later.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.678
Let's play out
one of your metaphors.

12:46.718 --> 12:48.628
Not gonna shoot from the hip

12:48.671 --> 12:50.394
or go off half-cocked.

12:50.431 --> 12:51.839
Hence the tight lips.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.897
Now, if the sheriff could at least
locate the one witness

12:55.936 --> 12:59.318
who testified to seeing
Holden rape Hanna Dean,

12:59.360 --> 13:01.182
that'd be a good start.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.557
Wouldn't it?

13:14.208 --> 13:16.183
All I'm saying
is the sheriff's right.

13:16.224 --> 13:18.135
They're just voicing
their disapproval.

13:18.178 --> 13:21.560
Them coming onto our property,
blowing things up,

13:21.602 --> 13:23.511
it's more than freedom of speech.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.074
I'm not saying that's the right way
to do it, but that's what they're doing.

13:26.114 --> 13:27.805
Well, they might find themselves
with their backsides

13:27.841 --> 13:30.330
covered in buckshot next time.

13:34.499 --> 13:36.354
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

13:39.970 --> 13:42.621
I don't think he's slept more than
a few hours since he got out.

13:42.658 --> 13:44.896
Light's always on in his room

13:44.931 --> 13:46.360
all hours of the night.

13:46.404 --> 13:48.825
Sounds like
a guilty conscience to me.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.228
Hey, Dad, I'll pick up
more coffee today.

13:56.325 --> 13:58.016
Why?

13:58.052 --> 13:59.710
I think that's a little stale.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.913
(sniffs)

14:07.077 --> 14:09.925
Janet and I have been talking
about the possibility

14:09.958 --> 14:12.608
of maybe Daniel leaving
for a little while.

14:15.430 --> 14:17.601
That might be best
for everybody.

14:17.638 --> 14:21.348
Be a hard subject to broach.

14:21.383 --> 14:24.383
Asking your son
to leave his home after he...

14:24.423 --> 14:27.292
Dad...

14:27.335 --> 14:30.018
can you say without a doubt
he's completely innocent?

14:30.054 --> 14:31.996
100%?

14:32.039 --> 14:34.495
Yeah.

14:34.535 --> 14:36.357
I'd do that.

14:37.991 --> 14:40.163
(coffeemaker gurgling)

14:44.135 --> 14:46.077
(blows)

15:01.577 --> 15:03.716
Things heating up out there?

15:04.938 --> 15:07.010
Yes.

15:07.050 --> 15:09.286
I'm gonna redo the kitchen.

15:09.321 --> 15:11.176
Oh.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.415
They have all these
makeover shows now

15:13.450 --> 15:16.265
and I think I can redo our kitchen
for not that much money.

15:16.299 --> 15:18.786
You know,
not anything real fancy,

15:18.827 --> 15:22.918
just get rid of the vinyl,
new countertops maybe.

15:22.954 --> 15:24.842
I like soapstone.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.428
Isn't it funny?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.631
For years I didn't have the gumption
to change out the dinnerware,

15:30.668 --> 15:32.937
and now I just want to go
rip everything up.

15:32.972 --> 15:35.971
That's a good instinct.

15:40.525 --> 15:44.038
- Daniel.
- Yes, Mama?

15:44.076 --> 15:47.338
Well...

15:47.373 --> 15:49.893
you being home and all...

15:49.932 --> 15:52.235
well, honey, it's just...

15:55.405 --> 15:57.380
well...

15:59.406 --> 16:01.315
you want to help?

16:01.357 --> 16:03.530
Help?

16:03.567 --> 16:06.284
Rip up the kitchen with me.

16:09.775 --> 16:12.109
(sobbing)

16:21.167 --> 16:23.272
I love you, Daniel.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.606
I'm glad, Mama.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.412
It's okay, sweetheart.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.376
- Mama.
- Yeah?

16:35.408 --> 16:38.442
I need some wrapping paper.

16:38.481 --> 16:40.750
Wrapping paper?

16:40.785 --> 16:42.891
Of course, honey.

16:42.930 --> 16:46.126
- Any particular kind?
- I don't know.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.797
Christmas would be fine.
Would it do?

16:50.833 --> 16:53.452
I don't have a problem with it.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.326
Okay.

16:59.379 --> 17:01.745
Not much to show
for all my time in Atlanta.

17:01.779 --> 17:03.819
Is that the measure, things?

17:03.858 --> 17:07.119
- This is America, Jon.
- Right.

17:09.522 --> 17:11.433
You think that's gonna keep
the bad guys out?

17:11.476 --> 17:13.680
Nope.

17:13.714 --> 17:15.723
What about a gun?

17:17.011 --> 17:18.255
What?

17:18.291 --> 17:20.877
Just wondering what you
might think about a gun.

17:20.916 --> 17:24.779
As in having one?

17:24.820 --> 17:27.025
A lady something or other.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.590
What are you doing?

17:32.629 --> 17:35.215
Pretending to be Ted Kennedy
in his grave.

17:42.933 --> 17:44.177
Are you serious?

17:44.214 --> 17:47.084
There aren't many institutions
to turn to around here.

17:47.126 --> 17:49.134
Hello. Welcome to Paulie.

17:49.175 --> 17:51.150
My name is Amantha
and I'll be your tour guide.

17:51.191 --> 17:53.493
And then there's our
diddling problem.

17:53.526 --> 17:56.112
Did I just say diddling?

17:56.150 --> 17:58.769
Do it enough,
might as well say it.

17:58.808 --> 18:01.906
- The senator knows.
- What?

18:01.944 --> 18:03.438
- I think.
- How could that be?

18:03.479 --> 18:05.999
'Cause the whole town
is bugged.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.014
There's spies everywhere.

18:08.056 --> 18:10.260
Motel maintenance man
works for Homeland Security.

18:10.296 --> 18:11.955
Take your pick.

18:15.129 --> 18:16.722
I won't be here for a while,
you know?

18:16.761 --> 18:18.965
- I know.
- This is not my only case.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.302
- I know, Jon, I know.
- Okay.

18:21.336 --> 18:23.191
So...

18:25.113 --> 18:27.502
I think either you
move back to Atlanta,

18:27.545 --> 18:30.131
or let's get you a gun if you're
gonna stay here in this place.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.282
Jon.

18:31.321 --> 18:32.815
Don't tell me
you've dealt with this before

18:32.857 --> 18:35.956
because you haven't dealt
with this before, Amantha.

18:35.994 --> 18:38.231
You were 12 years old.
You were living with your parents.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.754
Daniel was already in jail
and on his way to death row.

18:40.795 --> 18:43.664
That's what kept the bad guys
at bay back then, not you.

18:50.523 --> 18:52.433
Sheriff on recording:
Hey, Trey. It's Carl checking in.

18:52.476 --> 18:54.745
If you hear from George,
let me know, would you?

18:54.779 --> 18:56.568
Having a hard time
tracking him down.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.643
Appreciate it.

18:58.684 --> 19:00.691
Hope to see you on Wednesday.

19:04.284 --> 19:06.423
(motor starts)

19:14.172 --> 19:16.759
(knocking)

19:25.534 --> 19:27.290
Hey, Daniel.

19:27.325 --> 19:29.782
Come on in.

19:29.823 --> 19:31.765
Where's Amantha?

19:31.806 --> 19:34.294
She's doing laundry.

19:37.599 --> 19:41.374
Are you doing okay
with things?

19:41.407 --> 19:43.895
I don't think so, Jon.

19:45.088 --> 19:47.422
I don't think so.

19:47.456 --> 19:49.343
That's not...

19:49.376 --> 19:50.936
that's normal.

19:50.975 --> 19:52.666
What is?

19:52.704 --> 19:55.006
Not doing okay...

19:55.041 --> 19:56.863
considering everything.

19:56.897 --> 19:59.100
Why don't you come in?

20:01.568 --> 20:04.318
It shocked me to find you here.

20:04.352 --> 20:09.110
You know, just not used
to contemplating

20:09.153 --> 20:11.488
all the variables
one might encounter.

20:11.521 --> 20:14.555
I mean,
there were variables inside,

20:14.594 --> 20:18.009
but it wasn't like out here
where it's...

20:22.242 --> 20:26.465
and if you don't have
the years of experiences, the...

20:27.554 --> 20:30.402
if there isn't the repetition
of everyday living

20:30.434 --> 20:32.508
to make things mundane...

20:32.547 --> 20:38.144
because mundane is calming
and soothing.

20:38.180 --> 20:40.318
Mundane isn't out
of the ordinary.

20:42.276 --> 20:45.506
And when everything
is out of the ordinary...

20:49.349 --> 20:52.415
it can be too much sometimes,
you know?

20:53.701 --> 20:55.839
Like finding you
behind this door

20:55.877 --> 20:58.878
when I didn't even consider
there could be

20:58.918 --> 21:01.504
somebody else behind
this door but my sister.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.952
Your mind puts it together,
of course, but...

21:05.990 --> 21:07.899
(exhales)

21:07.942 --> 21:12.547
I mean, even just the door opening
is still very unreal.

21:13.734 --> 21:16.123
- Does that make sense?
- Of course.

21:17.830 --> 21:19.740
Daniel, it does.

21:21.639 --> 21:23.712
Okay.

21:25.959 --> 21:27.650
Oh. Ahem.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.989
Hey, honey.

21:30.024 --> 21:32.195
This is a nice surprise.

21:37.544 --> 21:39.137
What's up?

21:39.177 --> 21:43.879
You remember the pecan grove
that Dad used to take us to?

21:44.968 --> 21:49.061
You were only about five or six.

21:50.057 --> 21:51.879
The one with the cows?

21:52.841 --> 21:55.078
Yes.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.055
With the cows.

21:57.097 --> 21:59.683
I do remember.

22:01.963 --> 22:03.424
You think...

22:04.651 --> 22:06.723
want to go for a drive out there?

22:08.139 --> 22:10.310
You still know how
to get out there?

22:11.723 --> 22:13.731
I think so.

22:15.404 --> 22:17.346
Okay.

22:25.739 --> 22:27.496
(engine stops)

23:13.328 --> 23:15.499
When I confessed,

23:15.536 --> 23:18.122
it was such a relief.

23:18.161 --> 23:21.870
I mean, to be free

23:21.905 --> 23:26.345
of all that unbelievable guilt
and regret that I was feeling.

23:26.384 --> 23:30.728
After I told them
that I killed her...

23:32.593 --> 23:35.659
I could finally accept
that she was dead, you know?

23:35.698 --> 23:37.323
You'd just turned 18.

23:38.897 --> 23:40.359
High on mushrooms.

23:43.762 --> 23:46.577
But after all that time on the row,

23:46.611 --> 23:49.131
the guilt returned.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.342
Guilt for what?

23:54.258 --> 23:55.982
Guilt that I was alive.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.776
Guilt that...

23:59.923 --> 24:04.146
I began to accept it
as my destiny, my fate.

24:05.364 --> 24:07.949
And I began to embrace it
as my purpose.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.963
Survivor's guilt.

24:10.005 --> 24:11.914
No more complicated than that.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.134
Is that it?

24:17.845 --> 24:21.391
Do you think I could ever
make it out here, really?

24:21.430 --> 24:24.015
Of course you can.

24:25.749 --> 24:27.571
And you will.

24:29.366 --> 24:31.406
I don't believe in anything.

24:32.469 --> 24:34.674
What about me

24:34.711 --> 24:36.750
and Mom and your...

24:36.791 --> 24:39.344
your brother?

24:39.382 --> 24:41.771
I've caused you all
so much pain.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.702
No, Danny.

24:43.734 --> 24:46.287
They caused us all
so much pain.

24:46.326 --> 24:49.327
I'm so sorry I said what I said
to you, Amantha.

24:49.368 --> 24:51.058
It's okay.

24:51.096 --> 24:52.689
I'd take it back if I could.

24:52.727 --> 24:55.149
No, there's a lot of truth
to what you said.

24:57.847 --> 24:59.671
It's okay.

25:03.384 --> 25:05.424
I don't know what to do.

25:05.464 --> 25:08.050
Well...

25:08.088 --> 25:12.049
we could go back to Atlanta

25:12.088 --> 25:13.999
and stay up there for a while.

25:14.042 --> 25:16.562
There are people.

25:16.602 --> 25:20.279
People who know how to help you
with what you're going through.

25:20.313 --> 25:22.680
Get away from
all the pressures of being here.

25:22.714 --> 25:24.983
All the triggers around you.

25:25.017 --> 25:28.433
The danger here.

25:31.994 --> 25:33.652
What is it, honey?

25:40.508 --> 25:41.915
What's going on, Daniel?

25:46.555 --> 25:48.311
A strange life.

26:05.853 --> 26:07.577
Does it look open?

26:07.613 --> 26:10.134
I don't know.
I've never seen it open.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.696
See you later, sister.

26:16.735 --> 26:18.775
Count on it, brother.

26:18.815 --> 26:20.757
I know that's right.

26:25.406 --> 26:28.123
Hey.

26:28.159 --> 26:30.527
Love you.

26:30.559 --> 26:32.861
I love you, too.

26:35.936 --> 26:38.041
We're a leaky family.

26:40.192 --> 26:41.884
(chuckles)

27:26.020 --> 27:28.573
Kerwin:
You the man.

27:28.611 --> 27:30.138
Daniel:
With a plan.

27:30.179 --> 27:31.608
Wish I had a ceiling fan.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.889
Some can't, some can.

27:33.924 --> 27:36.063
Some will, some won't.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.522
Some do, some don't.

27:38.564 --> 27:40.190
Damn, why'd I say won't?

27:40.229 --> 27:42.684
Wait, now. Wait, now.
Hold up, hold up.

27:42.724 --> 27:45.539
Some will, some won't.

27:45.573 --> 27:48.257
Some do, some don't.

27:48.294 --> 27:51.228
I shine, I float.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.212
- (laughs)
- I float?

27:53.254 --> 27:54.431
Yes, sir.
Some will, some won't.

27:54.470 --> 27:57.187
Some do, some don't.
I shine, I float.

27:57.221 --> 27:59.710
I'm dull, I'm gaunt.
And I quit.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.019
Come on, man.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.910
Tired of playing.

28:03.942 --> 28:06.812
What, you got plans?
You going somewhere?

28:06.855 --> 28:08.382
He ain't going nowhere.

28:08.423 --> 28:11.686
Long after they put that
death needle in your arm,

28:11.719 --> 28:13.661
he's gonna be right here with me.

28:13.703 --> 28:16.420
You're the saddest man
I've ever known.

28:16.456 --> 28:19.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're the sad man, Danny.

28:19.495 --> 28:21.884
Crying in your sleep
over your little Hanna.

28:21.927 --> 28:24.743
Gonna be crying over
your little Kerwin, too.

28:24.777 --> 28:26.337
Won't be me crying.

28:26.376 --> 28:29.725
And that's why you're the saddest man
I've ever known.

28:29.768 --> 28:33.064
'Cause you can't feel
anything for anybody.

28:33.096 --> 28:36.413
You can't cry for anybody.

28:40.873 --> 28:43.240
Kerwin:
Oh, man, he got you.

28:43.274 --> 28:45.543
Peckerwood got bitch slapped.

28:45.577 --> 28:46.854
Nobody bitch slapped me.

28:46.889 --> 28:49.344
Oh, thou doth protest
too much, peckerwood.

28:49.386 --> 28:50.913
Wendall:
Shut up, bitch.

28:50.955 --> 28:54.916
The award for saddest man
in the world goes to

28:54.955 --> 28:56.810
peckerwood, peckerhead,
crackerbox,

28:56.842 --> 28:59.842
Uncle Jed Wendall Jelks.

28:59.882 --> 29:02.753
(laughs)
Shit.

29:03.788 --> 29:05.576
Ha!

29:17.708 --> 29:19.781
(music playing)

29:20.748 --> 29:21.837
Man:
Hello? Hello?

29:21.837 --> 29:22.819
Man:
Hello? Hello?

29:23.788 --> 29:26.952
Hey there.
I'm Chet.

29:28.046 --> 29:29.475
I'm Daniel.

29:30.990 --> 29:33.324
Oh, hey.

29:33.358 --> 29:34.951
Daniel.

29:34.989 --> 29:37.956
You're elusive, Chet.

29:37.998 --> 29:40.169
That's an underappreciated skill.

29:40.205 --> 29:42.410
So it can be developed.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.007
I think so.

29:44.046 --> 29:46.119
Probably helps to have a little bit
of a knack for it first.

29:48.719 --> 29:50.890
(music continues)

29:55.792 --> 29:58.247
Is that too much?
That music? Is that a little much?

29:58.287 --> 30:00.175
No.

30:00.207 --> 30:02.476
It's just right.

30:02.512 --> 30:05.381
My friends think
I'm a sad-oholic.

30:05.423 --> 30:07.694
Don't get help.

30:08.881 --> 30:13.354
I just like to have something
to balance out the farce, you know?

30:13.392 --> 30:16.109
I think farce may be sadder.

30:16.145 --> 30:19.080
God, you're right.

30:19.122 --> 30:21.227
It's all sad.

30:21.266 --> 30:23.437
And farcical.

30:23.474 --> 30:25.328
(chuckles)

30:26.289 --> 30:30.446
You looking for anything
in particular, Daniel?

30:32.146 --> 30:34.601
You know who I am,
don't you, Chet?

30:34.643 --> 30:37.163
I do, Daniel.

30:42.514 --> 30:46.672
I would like to get something
for somebody.

30:46.707 --> 30:48.431
Someone special?

30:48.467 --> 30:51.882
Someone I recently met.

30:51.924 --> 30:53.778
Ain't you something?

30:53.811 --> 30:56.397
I got something for you.

30:56.436 --> 30:58.412
(music continues)

31:22.774 --> 31:24.749
(phone buzzing)

31:42.872 --> 31:45.687
- Their adopt-a-friend special...
...resided actually...

31:45.719 --> 31:47.475
...Chapel Road all the way
to Covington...

31:47.512 --> 31:50.447
TV reporter: Landmark Homerville
restaurant was shut down...

31:50.489 --> 31:52.790
(TV audio changing)

32:06.298 --> 32:07.891
I like your top.

32:10.425 --> 32:13.491
I got it today for you.

32:16.794 --> 32:18.583
Looks good on you.

32:20.378 --> 32:22.288
Thank you, Teddy.

32:28.252 --> 32:31.002
- Teddy.
- Yeah, babe?

32:32.667 --> 32:35.766
I think the baptism
might have been a mistake.

32:36.732 --> 32:39.066
Too much too soon.

32:41.181 --> 32:43.068
I don't know.

32:45.309 --> 32:46.618
I just don't know.

32:48.765 --> 32:50.904
You had good intentions.

32:50.940 --> 32:53.658
You think so?

32:57.054 --> 32:58.909
I know so.

33:00.830 --> 33:02.390
You're a good person, Tawney.

33:55.265 --> 33:57.055
Guard:
Need to go.

34:03.235 --> 34:06.017
Daniel. Daniel.

34:06.050 --> 34:08.090
Daniel, l...

34:08.130 --> 34:10.978
I need to say something
to my friend.

34:11.972 --> 34:14.077
Doesn't look like he wants
to speak to you.

34:14.114 --> 34:16.219
I just need a moment.

34:16.260 --> 34:19.161
- Need to go.
- Please.

34:19.204 --> 34:20.960
It's okay.

34:27.397 --> 34:29.152
Look at me.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.639
Look at me, brother.

34:34.726 --> 34:36.482
Daniel.

34:47.206 --> 34:49.889
I know you didn't do it.

34:51.591 --> 34:53.827
How do you know?

34:53.862 --> 34:55.521
Because I know you.

34:56.839 --> 34:58.432
Because I know you.

34:59.590 --> 35:01.631
Because I know you.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.899
We have to go.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.398
Bye, brother.

35:23.433 --> 35:24.993
(gate buzzes)

35:32.714 --> 35:34.819
(gate buzzes)

35:48.587 --> 35:50.823
(music playing)

35:51.820 --> 35:54.373
(car approaching)

36:25.965 --> 36:27.940
(grunts)
