That hits.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.192
-I am so psyched
that we're going back.
-[grunts]

00:25.225 --> 00:26.660
-Yeah, yes.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.029
You guys, I mean, arcade games,
pizza, comedy.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.664
-What more
do you want in a place?
-You can't beat it.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.566
The best part about
Risk E. Rat's, though,

00:32.599 --> 00:34.401
is that they make kids feel
like they're the ones in charge.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.636
-Yeah...
-Totally.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.371
Like, that's where
I became a man

00:37.404 --> 00:39.139
and saw my first set of boobies,
at Risk E.'s. [laughs]

00:39.173 --> 00:40.574
-Really?
-Uh-huh.
-Wait, what?

00:40.607 --> 00:42.142
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I don't know about this.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.044
Oh, yeah, dude,
Justine the Teen Dream.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.480
She was one of the robots in
the Animatronic No Rules Band.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.081
-You guys remember that?
-Yeah, of course.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.050
Right, so if you got off
the Train to Kid City

00:50.083 --> 00:52.286
and you snuck backstage,
you could see under her shirt

00:52.319 --> 00:54.521
-just before she came out
to perform.
-Ooh...

00:54.555 --> 00:56.056
-[laughs]
-Uh, yeah, I remember
hearing about that,

00:56.089 --> 00:57.424
but I thought that was
just a legend.

00:57.457 --> 00:58.725
-That's real, dude.
-No, that was real, dude.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.761
-You saw them?
-I saw 'em, I saw 'em.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.296
-Yeah. Yeah.
-That was the fir-first set
of boobs I ever saw

01:02.329 --> 01:04.031
-since my mom's, so...
-Yeah. [groans]

01:04.064 --> 01:05.999
Do they still have that room
where they paddle you

01:06.033 --> 01:08.468
-if you're out of line?
-Oh, no, uh, in our day

01:08.502 --> 01:09.770
they called it
the Time-Out Room.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.638
And you would just go
and sit there

01:11.672 --> 01:14.007
and fester in your candy-fueled
rage for about 20 minutes.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.609
-[chuckling]
-Then you learned your lesson,

01:15.642 --> 01:17.110
and they'd send you back out
to unleash it on the kids.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.278
Yeah, listen,
at the end of the day

01:18.312 --> 01:20.013
it's all part of the fun.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.015
I know, but speaking of fun,
let's keep the song...

01:22.049 --> 01:23.483
-Yeah, yeah,
turn the song back on.
-Yeah, crank that shit.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.219

02:00.487 --> 02:02.022

-Yeah, yeah.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.657
But it still sounds
the same, though, right?

02:03.690 --> 02:05.192
But, boy, that noise sure would
send the parents running,

02:05.225 --> 02:06.660
-wouldn't it?
-[Dee] Yeah.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.362
-[laughs]
-Oh, remember when
the moms would go

02:08.395 --> 02:10.430
-in the padded bar?
-Oh, yeah, they soundproofed it.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.166
Yeah, they soundproofed it
so you couldn't hear it.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.567
-[laughs]
-Yeah.
-Oh, they would get hammered.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.068
[Charlie]
What you got there, bozo?

02:15.102 --> 02:16.670
Just need you to sign
these waivers.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.172
Eh, no waivers, no.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.373
I'm not really supposed to
let you in

02:19.406 --> 02:20.474
unless you sign this.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.742
Oh, yeah, well, listen.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.143
Well, I agree
it's total bullshit

02:23.177 --> 02:24.444
that we would have
to sign a waiver

02:24.478 --> 02:26.046
and also that
we could bum-rush you

02:26.079 --> 02:27.414
and there's nothing
you could do about it.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.283
But you know what?
Listen, today

02:29.316 --> 02:30.717
we're just gonna have fun,
we're not gonna do any of that.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.352
We'll sign your goddamn waivers,

02:32.386 --> 02:33.654
but I want you to know that,
for the record,

02:33.687 --> 02:35.289
we're doing this under protest.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.191
Sure, I don't care.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.760
-Okay. Cool, man.
-Hey, here's
a little something for you.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.562
[quietly]
That's not my name.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.464
Yeah, I just went...
[gibbers, laughs]

02:44.498 --> 02:46.366
There's a bottom section,
too... okay.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.635
-All right, man.
-None of 'em are really...

02:48.669 --> 02:50.504
Okay.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.574
Mmm.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.108
What the hell are you doing?

02:55.142 --> 02:56.376
Drinking water.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.511
What does it look
like I'm do...?

02:57.544 --> 02:59.746
Get the hell out of here!

02:59.780 --> 03:01.682
Frank, what...?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.584
-I guess he's thirsty.
-Yeah.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.119
All right, well, we have a few
hours before the show begins.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.288
I was thinking I would go
redeem my old tickets

03:08.322 --> 03:10.190
and then maybe play
some Skee-Ball.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.092
-Yeah, good call, man.
Nice. Have fun, have fun.
-Yeah?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.328
-Get it, go ahead. Yo.
-Hey, uh, Charlie, um,

03:14.361 --> 03:16.163
I can't get past

03:16.196 --> 03:18.432
-this whole Justine
the Teen Dream thing.
-Sure.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.068
And this feeling that I just
missed out on my childhood.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.237
-Yeah, mm-hmm.
-And I'm just wondering if

03:23.270 --> 03:24.538
-maybe you want to...
-Yes, I do.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.006
-Yeah?
-Yeah, let's go.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.008
Uh...
Well, they're gonna go check out

03:28.041 --> 03:29.576
some animatronic titties, so...

03:29.610 --> 03:31.378
Hey, you want to do
the joke hunt?

03:31.411 --> 03:34.181
-Yeah! Did you have that
when you were a kid?
-Yeah.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.349
Where you search around
for the little pieces of cheese

03:35.382 --> 03:36.517
and they have jokes attached?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.218
Yeah, and if you got 'em all...

03:38.252 --> 03:39.586
-Yeah.
-...you'd get to meet
Risk E. himself.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.154
And he'd do
his whole routine for you.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.023
Where he would smack
his kids in the head

03:43.056 --> 03:44.525
because they were pieces of shit

03:44.558 --> 03:46.193
and then he would
bust his brother

03:46.226 --> 03:47.661
because he was a lazy drunk.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.563
That was so funny.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.065
-[both laugh]
-Oh, yeah.
I mean, that, that's funny.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.401
They changed it a bit
by-by the '80s.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.769
-Oh.
-Yeah, I think they...

03:55.802 --> 03:56.737
It was a little bit more
highbrow and, like,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.338
um, uh, topical,

03:58.372 --> 04:00.407
like, like, uh,
like diverse ethnic stuff.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.043
Oh, ethnic, yeah.
Racist.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.578
Mm, no, no.
Not, not racist.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.014
Thinks like, um, you know,
like making fun of people

04:07.047 --> 04:09.249
for not belonging here.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.319
Right? Or like, like it's funny
when people sound funny

04:12.352 --> 04:14.788
because they're, they don't,
they're not from...

04:14.821 --> 04:16.023
they're not from here.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.524
Yeah, because of their race.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.426
Hmm, I don't think that was it
because it was like,

04:19.459 --> 04:21.061
it's like a fish out of water...

04:21.094 --> 04:22.262
-kind of...
-Uh, okay.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.630
Satire? I don't know.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.698
I can't wait to see
who the victims are

04:24.731 --> 04:26.266
these days.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.101
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Totally.
-Yeah. Let's go.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.136
-Let's-let's go find
some cheese.
-Let's... okay.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.037
Let's go. Let's go this way.

04:30.070 --> 04:30.771
-Yeah.
-Come on.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.040
♪ ♪

04:34.074 --> 04:35.409
No more Game Boys,
but they do have a PlayStation.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.777
That's an upgrade.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.146
-Can I help you, sir?
-Ah, yes, you can.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.248
I brought my tickets
and I'd like to make a purchase.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.583
Where are your guns?

04:42.616 --> 04:43.750
Uh, excuse me?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.485
Uh, the gun section.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.754
I'm very specifically
looking for Risk E.'s rifle.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.424
It had a real heavy feel to it,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.326
it was very realistic,
had a good smoky bang.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.094
I used to put pebbles in there

04:54.127 --> 04:55.596
and I could fire them, like,
right at Charlie's eye.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.331
It was awesome.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.333
Oh, uh, I don't think we have
anything like that.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.001
We have an orange space laser.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.638
What t
he hell am I supposed to
do with an orange space laser?

05:04.671 --> 05:07.374
Have you ever seen anybody use
a space laser in real life?

05:07.407 --> 05:08.775
How do I simulate

05:08.809 --> 05:10.511
real-world violence
with something like that?

05:10.544 --> 05:13.146
Why would you want to simulate
real-world violence?

05:13.180 --> 05:14.448
To get it out of
my system, bozo.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.149
All right, fine.
Forget it.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.051
Just get me one of those, um...

05:18.085 --> 05:19.486
switchblades that are combs.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.021
I don't know what that is.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.389
The switchblades
that become combs

05:22.422 --> 05:24.191
that you can threaten
your friends with,

05:24.224 --> 05:25.359
but then you don't know whether
it's a blade or a comb.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.660
You know what I'm talking about?

05:26.693 --> 05:28.595
Okay, how about
some of that, um...

05:28.629 --> 05:30.330
can you get me some of that gum

05:30.364 --> 05:32.199
that I can put in my mouth
and pretend like I got,

05:32.232 --> 05:33.700
like, a big old fat lip
and spit all over the place?

05:33.734 --> 05:34.768
You know what I'm talking about?
The...

05:34.801 --> 05:36.503
I don't think we have those--

05:36.537 --> 05:38.338
What about the candy cigarettes?
Give me candy cigarettes!

05:38.372 --> 05:40.741
Those were discontinued
because cigarettes are illegal.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.775
Okay, for Christ's sakes,

05:41.808 --> 05:43.177
can you get me like...

05:43.210 --> 05:44.678
the extra large
Atomic FireBalls?

05:44.711 --> 05:46.380
I believe they were considered
a choking hazard.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.515
Oh, my God,
a-a box of Nerds, nerd.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.551
Now, Nerds.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.553
Oh, you got those.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.388
What the...?

05:54.421 --> 05:56.690
What is, what is this?
Where's the mouse hall?

05:56.723 --> 05:59.092
[Dennis]
Hold on a second.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.662
What, what? So you're telling me
they shut down the-the-the

06:01.695 --> 06:04.198
Ride to Kid City
for a superstore?

06:04.231 --> 06:06.466
I mean, there's clearly
no mouse hall.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.135
There's no way to access
this thing.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.736
-Dude, what are they doing, man?
-I don't know...

06:09.770 --> 06:12.306
Also, okay, what's up
with the helmet, right?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.341
-[stammers]
-Risk E. does not wear
a helmet, remember?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.742
If he would fall and hit
his head, he would say...

06:15.776 --> 06:17.211
"That's what the bone's for."

06:17.244 --> 06:18.712
"That's what
the bone was for," right?

06:18.745 --> 06:20.347
And he'd come up, he'd crack you
on the back of the head.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.049
He'd smack you in the back
of the head.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.550
-"That's what the bone is for!"
-"Bone is for!"

06:23.584 --> 06:25.185
-[goofy laugh]
-I mean, that was, like...

06:25.219 --> 06:26.653
-part of the fun of it.
-It's unbelievable, man.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.455
-Things change, I-I get that.
-Okay, fine.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.123
-Things change, right?
-Yeah.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.725
I mean, look,
I don't want to be that old guy

06:31.758 --> 06:33.360
who's, like, complaining about
the way things used to be,

06:33.393 --> 06:35.395
but, you know, I, uh...

06:35.429 --> 06:37.531
-Want to see boobs.
-I just do.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.032
You didn't get to see 'em,

06:39.066 --> 06:40.133
and it was a big part of
the experience.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.268
They knew that you needed that.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.003
Risk E. knew that
you needed that.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.738
They knew you were curious.
It wasn't a big deal.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.406
-Yeah.
-The boys, they need
something to as... you know.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.141
Yeah, yeah.
It's great for the boys.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.476
And it's also good for the girls
because then they know

06:49.510 --> 06:50.711
what they're supposed
to look like.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.412
It's aspirational.
I mean, this,

06:52.446 --> 06:53.580
I don't think this is
the work of Risk E.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.182
You know what I mean? Like...

06:55.215 --> 06:56.383
I feel like Risk E.'s
walled off in there,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.018
and-and I think

06:58.051 --> 07:00.687
Risk E. would want us
to take a risk right now.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.289
He would want us to do it.

07:02.322 --> 07:06.160
Do it, whatever we want.
Watch my back.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.427
-No one looking?
-Uh-huh.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.762
-[thuds]
-Oh.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.264
-Okay.
-All right.

[clattering]

07:13.066 --> 07:15.102
Good, I think you...
made some headway, though.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.549
These balls have
no weight to 'em.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.451
Back in my day, you could crush
a man's skull with one of these.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.287
[machine chimes]

07:33.320 --> 07:34.521
Oh, hey, you're pretty good.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.589
Thanks.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.124
I'm going for 10,000 tickets.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.226
Oh, yeah?
Dude, I got like 7,000.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.427
What? How do you have so many?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.562
I was really good
back in the day.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.596
Better than you.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.698
Oh, well, I only have 1,500.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.401
Oh, you know what we should do?
We should pool our tickets,

07:47.434 --> 07:49.603
and that way we can get, like,
the biggest prize they have.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.206
Uh, I don't think
you're allowed to do that.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.540
Yeah, you can.
This is America.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.541
You can do whatever
the fuck you want.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.276
You just cursed.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.312
So what?
We're in an arcade.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.479
And there's no adults around.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.747
Hey, do you know how much candy

08:00.781 --> 08:02.516
we can get
with this many tickets?

08:02.549 --> 08:05.018
I'm not allowed to eat candy.
I have to ask my parents.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.420
You don't have to ask
your parents anything.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.055
You can eat as much candy
as you want.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.122
You're at Risk E. Rat's.
That's the whole point.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.591
You can do whatever you want.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.025
-I want my mom.
-You're not getting your mom!

08:12.059 --> 08:14.027
Whoa!
Everything okay over here?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.362
Looks like someone might
need to take a breather.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.563
We don't need a breather.

All right? I'm just...

08:27.040 --> 08:29.443
I tell you what, I don't care
for these new scanners.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.478
You know, it was just so much
cooler when they were like...

08:31.512 --> 08:34.481
-Yeah.
-...little plastic pieces
of cheese with the joke on 'em.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.550
You'd read the joke
and toss it in the trash.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.018
You know what they,
they used to do?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.319
They used to put 'em

without them knowing it.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.189
-Really?
-Yeah, that was the fun thing,

08:42.222 --> 08:43.590
because then
you could cop a feel

08:43.624 --> 08:45.192
and they couldn't say anything

08:45.225 --> 08:47.561

they'd lose their jobs.

these sticks of molten cheese
that just came out of

09:03.410 --> 09:04.778

Well, he's a duck.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.600
I wouldn't say that
about a human.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.401
But you're telling me
I can't say a duck is retarded?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.470
-Yes.
-No? What do you mean?

10:03.504 --> 10:06.139
Suppose he walked up here,
and his feet were on backwards

10:06.173 --> 10:08.342
and his beak was on
the inside of his head,

10:08.375 --> 10:10.043
what, then I could
call him retarded?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.345

Well, no.
Then you're dealing with

10:11.378 --> 10:13.180
a mutant duck,
and that's not funny.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.016
But his whole shtick was that
he would drool and slobber

-and-and, you know,
he was like...
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:17.784 --> 10:22.689

the w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-words out.

-Yeah. I, yeah, I-I think so.
-Yeah.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.782

Now that I think of it,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.350
it's good that
they're updating that.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.452

a purple character

10:52.486 --> 10:54.188
-that does a Black voice.
-Why not?

10:54.221 --> 10:56.456
Well, because...

10:56.490 --> 10:58.125
If you're gonna put
a Black person in the band,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.393
it's got to be
representative of...

10:59.426 --> 11:01.061
It was a white guy
doing the voice.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.663
-That was the problem.
-Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.264
-Yeah, yeah.
-It was a white guy doing
a Black voice...

11:04.298 --> 11:05.732
-No, no, no, that's--
-...in a purple costume.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.267
That's not a good look,
you know what I mean?

11:07.301 --> 11:08.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No. For sure, for sure.

11:08.068 --> 11:08.735
Yeah, so...

11:08.769 --> 11:09.703
But they are purple.

11:09.736 --> 11:10.771
Who? What?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.472
Monsters.
You know, like...

11:12.506 --> 11:14.174
-Monsters are purple?
-Yeah.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.777
Blue, green, purple, orange,
and we can't just, like,

11:16.810 --> 11:19.346
not have purple monsters
in bands anymore.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.216
-All right, you know what? I...
-Oh, but they should have

11:22.249 --> 11:24.551
-white voices.
-Well, they should have
monster voices.

11:24.585 --> 11:26.119
They should have monster voices

11:26.153 --> 11:27.321
because we need monster
representation.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.023
So we can't just
put them in boxes.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.492
This is all very
complicated stuff, man.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.293
-It is complicated, man.
-It's tough to navigate it, man.

11:33.327 --> 11:35.395
I don't know what the answer is,
so I'm gonna move past it.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.663
-I tell you what, I...
-All right, as long
as they can still have

11:36.697 --> 11:38.265
-groovy monsters, you know?
-Yeah.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.000
Look at all this stuff.
Eh, tell you what,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.635
some of this stuff brings back
a lot of memories.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.003
Yeah, yeah.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.706
Oh, no.

Yeah, yeah.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.327
there is a lifelike set of
animatronic breasts under there?

12:07.361 --> 12:08.595
-I am, sir.
-Really?

12:08.629 --> 12:11.331
-Yeah. Very accurate design.
-Huh.

12:11.365 --> 12:13.433
-Uh, nipples.
-Interesting.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.035
-All the curves.
-Fascinating.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.336
-Yeah, wow, good.
-Yeah.

12:16.370 --> 12:19.072
Yeah, okay.
So I will take, uh...

12:19.106 --> 12:20.641
-Yeah.
-...the shirt off.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.410
-Let's, uh, let's pop it off.
-And, uh, I... hmm...

12:23.443 --> 12:25.512
Hmm, I'm sorry,
is it wrong to do this?

12:25.546 --> 12:27.714
If I'm being honest,
it feels wrong to me as well.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.284
-[chuckles] Right, but why?
Why would--?
-I don't know.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.785
-Is it 'cause she's underage?
-No.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.754
I mean, she's a robot,
man, like...

12:33.787 --> 12:35.455
-Right. Robot.
-They're ageless.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.424
Now, wait a second.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.394
We could just be two mature men
with an interest in robotics.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.296
This could be science

12:42.329 --> 12:44.631

a scientific experiment,

12:44.665 --> 12:46.333

to look at it, and--

12:46.366 --> 12:49.303

future robots, right?

science...

12:50.537 --> 12:52.172

-go ahead and...
-Yeah.

-How did they...?

dude, these are not them.

They-they took her tits off.
They literally sanded 'em off!

-That is disgusting.

-Unbelievable.
-Oh, my God.

And this could be the
religious conservatives, too.

You know, y-you don't know.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.400
-That's true.
-Which kind of--

13:20.434 --> 13:22.369
Lopping tits off feels like a,
feels like a religious move.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.737
-Yeah, that's
some kind of like--
-I don't know anymore.

how you're feeling right now.

Well, I... feel angry.

Is there anything else?

13:41.655 --> 13:46.226
Yeah, I feel...

You are stupid.
It's 'cause you're stupid.
