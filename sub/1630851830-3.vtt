WEBVTT

00:04.040 --> 00:06.680
I can see everything quite clearly.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.480
It has a stark beauty all its own.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.640
See me when I float like a dove.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.080
Skies above...

00:19.160 --> 00:21.040
Magnificent desolation.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.080
- Beautiful view.
- Isn't that something?

00:27.040 --> 00:29.360
Take me away.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.120
If I were to ask you,
"Where do you come from?"

01:03.120 --> 01:04.360
What would you say?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.720
What story would you tell?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.280
You might say,
"Well, I come from my home town..."

01:17.720 --> 01:20.000
Or "my city, " or "my country.”

01:29.440 --> 01:31.680
If you have
a particularly wide perspective,

01:31.760 --> 01:34.400
you might say,
"I come from Planet Earth."”

01:34.480 --> 01:38.840
But what is the largest structure
that we could legitimately call home?

01:43.800 --> 01:46.520
Well, I would argue, it's that.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.240
That faint arc of light

01:50.320 --> 01:54.000
that stretches across the sky
from horizon to horizon

01:54.080 --> 01:58.480
is an outer spiral arm
of our galaxy, the Milky Way,

01:58.560 --> 02:02.680
our home island of 400 billion stars.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.840
The Milky Way takes its name
from the dense band of stars

02:20.920 --> 02:24.680
that sweeps across the sky
on the clearest of nights.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.120
From our vantage point, here on Earth,
we see the galaxy from within.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.040
But if we could
travel outside the galaxy,

02:50.840 --> 02:53.400
We would see the entire structure.

02:57.440 --> 03:02.880
The Milky Way revealed as an island
of light surrounded by darkness.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.840
Hundreds of billions of stars
in a single disk,

03:15.880 --> 03:20.720
that's existed
since the universe was young.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.280
Only now are we
able to explore its history.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.680
How it was born,

03:51.040 --> 03:54.320
how, through a series
of remarkable events,

03:54.400 --> 03:57.560
it grew to become
the galaxy we inhabit today,

04:01.400 --> 04:05.800
and how, eventually, it will end.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.760
We've discovered our own part
in this story, too,

04:13.840 --> 04:18.120
living, as we do,
inside the Milky Way,

04:18.200 --> 04:22.400
just over halfway
along one of its magnificent arms,

04:23.600 --> 04:26.960
around a small but familiar star.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.320
The Milky Way is an island in a sense.

04:43.400 --> 04:49.360
Every star you can see in the night sky
is a part of our galaxy.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.520
Our nearest neighbouring large galaxy
is over two million light years away.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.880
So it certainly feels as if
we are isolated and alone,

04:57.960 --> 05:01.360
adrift in an ocean of dark.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.800
And that is true to a point.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.120
There is no conceivable technology

05:06.200 --> 05:10.520
that will ever allow us
to leave our island physically.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.800
But science allows us to leave
the Milky Way in our imaginations,

05:15.880 --> 05:18.720
to view our galaxy
from impossible perspectives

05:18.800 --> 05:22.760
in both space and time,
and to tell its story.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.360
One mission,
more than any other,

06:05.440 --> 06:08.400
has deepened our understanding
of the galaxy,

06:12.200 --> 06:16.120
a spacecraft bearing the name
of an ancient Greek goddess...

06:16.200 --> 06:18.760
Everything functioning beautifully.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.040
...Gaia...

06:24.440 --> 06:26.680
Coming up
on separation of the boosters.

06:26.760 --> 06:30.040
...ancestral mother
of all life on Earth.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.040
The four boosters,
the four points of light, falling away.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.960
Gaia's mission,

06:49.040 --> 06:54.040
to map the locations
of billions of stars in the Milky Way,

06:56.040 --> 06:59.160
nearly all of them for the first time.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.880
Gaia spins on its axis,

07:39.040 --> 07:42.520
its sensors scanning the galaxy
in all directions.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.800
Every star is mapped
an average of 70 times,

07:58.160 --> 08:02.400
allowing Gaia to calculate
the speed and direction of each one,

08:02.960 --> 08:08.760
pinpointing their locations with
accuracies up to 7, 000th of 7%,

08:13.680 --> 08:17.960
over 1.5 million stars every hour.

08:20.480 --> 08:25.080
Almost two billion in total so far.

08:29.760 --> 08:34.400
To create a map
like nothing ever seen before.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.880
The Gaia data is by far

08:46.960 --> 08:49.840
the most detailed star map
ever produced,

08:49.920 --> 08:53.360
a revolution in our understanding
of the Milky Way.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.520
This is the data,
and it looks like a,

08:59.600 --> 09:02.000
you know, an artist's impression
of a galaxy,

09:02.080 --> 09:04.040
something from science fiction.

09:04.280 --> 09:08.040
But this is a high-precision 3D map

09:08.120 --> 09:11.480
of our home, of our island of stars,

09:11.560 --> 09:14.360
and we can even fly through it.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.560
Such is the precision
of the mapping of the position.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.080
All these points of light are stars,

09:19.160 --> 09:23.040
some of them as far as 30,000
light years out from the solar system.

09:25.640 --> 09:30.480
The map allows us to journey through
the galaxy at impossible speeds,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.720
bringing distant stars within reach.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.840
But this is also
a journey through time.

09:52.360 --> 09:58.000
The extraordinary thing about this map
is that it's alive in a sense.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.320
I mean, Gaia didn't just measure
the positions of these stars,

10:01.400 --> 10:03.560
it measured their velocities.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.880
And that means we can tell
where those stars are going,

10:06.960 --> 10:09.440
what the galaxy is
going to be like in the future.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.600
But also, we can tell
where they came from.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.800
So, what the galaxy
was like in the past.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.480
By reversing the direction
of every star,

10:27.560 --> 10:30.240
we can rewind their histories,

10:32.760 --> 10:37.040
travelling backwards in time
through billions of years.

10:40.640 --> 10:47.640
Gala has initiated a new science,
a science of galactic archaeology,

10:47.720 --> 10:52.920
where we can ask questions
about the origins of our galaxy itself.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.920
The first galaxies emerged.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.400
Just a few hundred million years
after the Big Bang.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.720
The universe was criss-crossed
by a vast structure

11:30.800 --> 11:32.520
known as the cosmic web.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.200
Great filaments of dark matter

11:45.280 --> 11:49.920
along which gravity attracted
ever denser concentrations of gas

11:51.080 --> 11:55.120
separated by immense tracts
of empty space.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.320
The first stars were born
where the filaments crossed,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.240
where the gas was dense enough
to collapse under its own gravity,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.160
and for the stars to ignite.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.280
New stars formed in their billions,

12:49.920 --> 12:53.720
bound together
by their mutual gravitational pull.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.680
These were the first galaxies.

13:10.520 --> 13:15.720
Amongst them, the Milky Way,
in its embryonic form,

13:15.800 --> 13:19.440
far smaller
and more irregular in structure

13:19.520 --> 13:23.640
than the mature spiral galaxy
we inhabit today.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.800
The exact details
of the Milky Way's birth

13:41.880 --> 13:44.120
remained a subjective research.

13:45.160 --> 13:49.640
But thanks to modern day observations,
the story of how our galaxy grew

13:49.720 --> 13:54.040
from those early beginnings
is coming into much sharper relief.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.520
The Gaia data allows us to see

14:01.600 --> 14:04.040
how the Milky Way
evolved throughout its history.

14:04.440 --> 14:08.080
And one of the clues
that it's had an interesting history

14:08.160 --> 14:09.760
can be seen in this animation.

14:09.840 --> 14:14.600
You see that most of the stars
orbit in very regular orbits

14:14.680 --> 14:17.600
around the centre of the Milky Way.
That's exactly what you'd expect.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.480
But you can see here
that some of the stars

14:20.560 --> 14:22.760
have very different orbits, indeed.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.880
They seem to be flying
all over the place.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.400
And that tells us
that something dramatic happened

14:29.480 --> 14:33.600
at some point as our galaxy
made its way through the universe.

14:50.720 --> 14:55.960
Across the universe, hundreds of
billions of galaxies were forming.

15:09.560 --> 15:15.040
Some, just a few dozen, were born
close enough to the Milky Way

15:18.160 --> 15:22.120
that their mutual gravitational pull
drew them together,

15:26.200 --> 15:30.600
forming what we now know
as the local group of galaxies,

15:30.680 --> 15:33.240
our home archipelago.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.080
Six billion years
before the earth formed,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.920
some of the Milky Way stars
already had their own planets,

16:02.680 --> 16:07.960
early worlds that were about to witness
the transformation of the galaxy.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.320
The wonderful thing about astronomy
is that you can look up into the sky,

16:23.400 --> 16:28.440
and even if you can't see worlds,
you can imagine them,

16:28.520 --> 16:30.440
and you can imagine their stories.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.160
Like, over there,

16:34.200 --> 16:38.920
close to the bright star, Vega,
is Kepler-444.

16:39.480 --> 16:44.120
The faint ancient star
and planets orbiting around it

16:44.200 --> 16:46.760
that's witnessed
pretty much the entire history

16:46.840 --> 16:48.080
of the Milky Way galaxy.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.400
And then, maybe
swinging around in the sky,

16:58.560 --> 17:03.040
just close to the Plough constellation
that everybody can recognise,

17:03.120 --> 17:05.560
and follow it down.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.320
There's a really faint star there,
you can't see it with the naked eye.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.520
It's so nondescript
it doesn't even have a name.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.400
It's got a number.
It's got HD 73394.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.640
But that star is an alien star.

17:22.240 --> 17:27.160
It was born in another galaxy,
and it entered the Milky Way

17:27.240 --> 17:30.160
in a galactic collision
with a smaller galaxy,

17:31.000 --> 17:36.920
and Kepler-444 over there
witnessed it all,

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
and witnessed the Milky Way
being thrown into chaos.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.240
Kepler-444 was orbited
by five planets...

18:16.400 --> 18:20.400
and something new
had appeared in their skies.

18:29.720 --> 18:34.560
A smaller galaxy
was approaching the Milky Way,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.600
with stars that burn bright blue,

18:40.880 --> 18:42.920
Gaia-Enceladus,

18:45.320 --> 18:48.240
a member of the local group,

18:48.320 --> 18:51.800
roughly a quarter
of the size of our own galaxy.

19:17.840 --> 19:22.880
Over hundreds of millions of years,
the galaxies collided...

19:31.680 --> 19:38.000
The stars of Gaia-Enceladus penetrating
deep into the Milky Way's heart.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.160
But our galaxy held its ground,

19:58.320 --> 20:01.920
capturing billions of incoming stars.

20:25.200 --> 20:29.120
An entire galaxy, swallowed whole.

21:01.840 --> 21:06.400
These alien stars
remain in our galaxy to this day.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.400
The Gaia data tell us that

21:24.480 --> 21:28.240
collisions are the driving force
of galactic evolution.

21:31.520 --> 21:36.240
Some galaxies cease to exist
as independent islands of stars,

21:39.520 --> 21:42.400
while others grow and prosper.

21:48.120 --> 21:52.080
The survival of the fittest, writ large.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.200
"When galaxies collide.”

21:56.280 --> 22:00.280
You know, that phrase puts images of
Hollywood disaster movies into the mind,

22:00.360 --> 22:02.800
of stars getting ripped apart.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.360
But that's not what happens at all.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.360
I mean, you imagine
that our sun were,

22:08.440 --> 22:12.000
say, the size of a small pebble
or a grain of sand.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.680
The nearest neighbouring star
in this region of the galaxy

22:14.760 --> 22:17.280
will be somewhere over by those hills.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.360
The distances between stars is immense.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.120
The stars don't collide.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.440
So, when galaxies interact,
the stars get scattered.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.120
The shape of the galaxy changes,
but nothing gets destroyed.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.920
And, in fact, sometimes

22:32.000 --> 22:34.880
galactic collisions
can be engines of creation.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.880
Gala-Enceladus,
the alien galaxy,

22:51.960 --> 22:55.560
had brought with it
fresh supplies of interstellar gas,

22:58.200 --> 23:01.600
the raw material of star formation.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.080
For a time, this gas heightened the rate

23:24.160 --> 23:27.000
at which the Milky Way
could produce new stars,

23:30.320 --> 23:32.120
helping it to grow.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.400
But long before our star was born,

23:39.480 --> 23:43.720
the Gaia-Enceladus collision era
drew to a close.

23:58.040 --> 24:03.560
What triggered the formation of the sun
has long remained a puzzle.

24:15.320 --> 24:19.600
But the Gaia telescope has discovered
new clues to its origin,

24:20.960 --> 24:24.520
in the events that followed
billions of years later,

24:36.120 --> 24:39.760
as our island of stars
continued to evolve.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.720
On the distant shores of the Milky Way,

25:15.800 --> 25:20.120
Gaia has investigated
a structure of epic proportions...

25:31.320 --> 25:35.520
A stream of stars
winding their way around the galaxy.

26:00.920 --> 26:05.880
This stream of stars is enormous.
It's almost unimaginable in scale.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.920
If you look up into the night sky,
those stars that you can see are,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.480
at most, a few thousand
light years away.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.040
You think about that,
the light began its journey to your eye

26:17.120 --> 26:21.240
from the most distant stars
when the pharaohs ruled Egypt.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.200
And then, if you look out
to the Milky Way,

26:23.280 --> 26:25.520
to the shores of our galaxy,

26:25.600 --> 26:29.200
you see light from a few tens
of thousands of light years away.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.080
I mean, that light began its journey

26:31.160 --> 26:33.560
when there were Neanderthals
here in Europe.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.560
But this stream of stars
wraps around the galaxy.

26:36.640 --> 26:41.360
It's hundreds of thousands
of light years in extent.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.880
A structure that large
demands an explanation.

26:49.520 --> 26:56.080
The stream is wreckage, it's footprints,
if you like, of a very violent event.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.880
Gaia has confirmed the origins
of this immense structure...

27:25.480 --> 27:30.880
through the telescope's unique ability
to help us travel through time...

27:32.520 --> 27:33.880
Backwards.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.800
The data tell a story

27:49.080 --> 27:51.480
of a new age of star birth,

27:56.600 --> 28:02.840
of the transformation of the Milky Way
triggered by another galactic collision.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.040
It was another galaxy
from our local group,

28:37.080 --> 28:39.200
Sagittarius dwarf,

28:40.840 --> 28:44.240
perhaps 20 times smaller
than the Milky Way,

28:44.640 --> 28:47.480
was torn apart in the impact.

29:01.600 --> 29:07.160
Sagittarius dwarf brought fresh supplies
of the vital ingredient for star birth.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.520
That is the sound of
the most common element in the universe.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.200
This radio telescope is pointing
towards the Milky Way,

29:28.280 --> 29:32.480
as she's just risen above the horizon
over there behind the clouds,

29:32.560 --> 29:36.200
and what you're listening to
is hydrogen gas.

29:43.840 --> 29:48.320
The radio telescope is detecting
the faint signal of hydrogen

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
from across the galaxy.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.560
Hydrogen is found
throughout the Milky Way,

29:55.640 --> 30:00.520
sometimes in the form
of towering clouds light years high.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.520
These regions are star factories

30:37.600 --> 30:41.880
where the dense clouds of hydrogen gas
collapse under gravity,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
to forge new stars.

30:58.240 --> 31:02.400
Hydrogen atoms radiate radio waves

31:02.480 --> 31:05.640
at a very particular wavelength,
21 centimetres.

31:07.600 --> 31:12.040
And as I speak, that radiation has been
captured by that radio telescope.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.800
Imagine, there are atoms over there.
And by "over there,"

31:19.880 --> 31:24.000
I mean, what, thousands,
tens of thousands of light years away.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.920
And at some point,
way, way back in the past,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.080
out came the radiation,
and we can listen to it.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.200
So, we're listening
to the lifeblood of our galaxy.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.680
As Sagittarius dwarf
passed through the Milky Way,

32:08.240 --> 32:12.760
it brought fresh gas and fresh energy.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.040
The impact sent ripples
across the Milky Way,

32:39.160 --> 32:43.800
triggering another spectacular era
of star formation.

32:54.480 --> 32:58.360
And in the outer regions
of the galaxy...

33:03.920 --> 33:07.080
our own star was born.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.360
The sun was soon joined by the earth...

33:28.520 --> 33:33.640
and together, they set out
on their journey through the galaxy.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.000
We were born in the Milky Way,

33:56.440 --> 34:00.120
but we may have been
conceived in a collision.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.880
Now, we can't say for certain that
the collision with Sagittarius dwarf

34:09.960 --> 34:11.920
caused the formation of our sun.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.760
The data is not precise enough,

34:13.840 --> 34:16.440
and our understanding is
not deep enough for that.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.920
But what we can say is
that the birth of the sun

34:19.000 --> 34:22.040
coincided with
enhanced rates of star formation

34:22.120 --> 34:24.920
in the Milky Way,
caused by that collision.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.160
But that's not
quite the end of the story,

34:28.240 --> 34:32.160
because, in a very real sense,
the collision is still underway.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.240
The remains of Sagittarius dwarf

34:45.320 --> 34:48.680
are still orbiting
on the fringes of the Milky Way.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.280
Over the last five billion years,

35:05.360 --> 35:09.080
the galaxy has crossed our path
two more times,

35:25.000 --> 35:29.720
each interaction triggering
a new generation of star birth.

35:53.280 --> 35:58.640
A fresh sprinkling of light
inside our galaxy's spiral arms,

36:15.880 --> 36:21.120
the finishing touches
on a masterpiece of galactic creation.

36:33.960 --> 36:38.760
The poet, John Donne, famously wrote,
"No man is an island entire of itself,

36:38.840 --> 36:42.480
"every man is a piece
of the continent, a part of the main,”

36:42.560 --> 36:44.560
by which, he meant that
no human being

36:44.640 --> 36:47.120
can isolate themselves
from the rest of humanity

36:47.200 --> 36:51.440
because our origins and our fates
are so deeply intertwined,

36:51.520 --> 36:54.600
and therefore, we must
care deeply for each other.

36:54.680 --> 36:59.520
And the same is true for galaxies.
No galaxy is an island entire of itself.

36:59.600 --> 37:03.680
And the history of the Milky Way
stretches back 13 billion years or more.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.520
That's pretty much
the entire history of the universe,

37:06.600 --> 37:10.240
and its story is a story
of collisions and interactions

37:10.320 --> 37:14.560
between galaxies, of rivers,
and flows and streams of stars

37:14.640 --> 37:19.760
stirring up the void and triggering
the formation of worlds like ours.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.080
I mean, you, me,
everyone can trace our origins

37:24.160 --> 37:27.680
back to a collision between galaxies.

37:27.760 --> 37:32.960
You may be small, but you are
a consequence of grand events.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.760
And those grand events
haven't stopped.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.880
It just feels like it
because we don't perceive events

38:14.960 --> 38:18.840
that play out over billions of years,
involving billions of stars.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.640
But the unique thing
about this time in history

38:22.720 --> 38:24.640
is that we can speak
with some confidence,

38:24.720 --> 38:29.960
not only about our galaxy's past,
but also about our galaxy's future.

38:30.360 --> 38:34.400
And just as inexorably as
those great islands of stars

38:34.480 --> 38:39.000
drift through the universe,
change will come again.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.400
We move into the future

39:07.480 --> 39:11.480
with a new understanding
of our place in the galaxy.

39:24.880 --> 39:31.040
We are inhabitants of a small planet
orbiting around an ordinary star,

39:31.120 --> 39:34.760
where something extraordinary
has happened.

39:47.160 --> 39:52.360
But although the galaxy made us,
it wasn't made for us.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.320
We are accidental by-products
of its history

40:00.240 --> 40:04.720
and we will be passive witnesses
to its ongoing evolution.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.080
The Milky Way is the great survivor,

40:13.160 --> 40:17.560
and the echoes of its turbulent history
are literally written across the sky.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.240
Over there in the southwest,
the remnants of Sagittarius dwarf,

40:22.320 --> 40:25.200
the debris from that collision
still wandering around

40:25.280 --> 40:27.960
somewhere on the fringes
of the Milky Way.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.560
And in that direction,
as Sirius rises in the east

40:31.640 --> 40:33.640
in the constellation of Canis Major,

40:33.720 --> 40:36.080
there are the remains
of another dwarf galaxy

40:36.160 --> 40:38.600
that we think
collided with us long ago.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.680
So, the Milky Way
pretty much devours anything

40:43.760 --> 40:46.160
that comes into this region of space

40:46.240 --> 40:51.680
because it's the largest galaxy
in the neighbourhood, except for one.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.200
The local group is home

41:01.280 --> 41:05.560
to another galaxy
that rivals our own in size.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.760
A galaxy that's been
hiding in plain sight.

41:17.360 --> 41:21.000
Right up there, just between
the consolations of Cassiopeia

41:21.080 --> 41:22.760
and the Square of Pegasus,

41:22.840 --> 41:26.200
is a faint, misty patch of light
in the sky

41:26.280 --> 41:28.480
about twice the diameter of a full moon.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.520
So, you can certainly
see it with binoculars.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.040
And even in the city,

41:32.120 --> 41:34.600
I can take a photograph of it
with a camera like this.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.400
And there it is.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.720
That object is the Andromeda galaxy,

41:44.840 --> 41:49.520
and you see that it's a spiral shape.
You can see it even in this photograph.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.240
In many ways, Andromeda is our twin.

42:06.520 --> 42:11.000
And it's a twin that we've been
able to explore in incredible detail.

42:13.080 --> 42:19.680
Three, two, one,
and lift-off of Space Shuttle Atlantis,

42:19.760 --> 42:23.000
on a final visit to enhance
the vision of Hubble

42:24.880 --> 42:27.840
into the deepest grandeur
of our universe.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.960
Standing by for SRB separation.

42:45.680 --> 42:50.000
The Hubble Space Telescope
Is in its fourth decade of operation.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.760
Its ongoing mission has given us

43:02.840 --> 43:06.520
some of the most detailed images
of the universe ever seen.

43:19.760 --> 43:24.400
Over the years, Hubble has frequently
turned its attention to Andromeda,

43:32.560 --> 43:35.680
2.5 million light years from Earth.

43:39.480 --> 43:43.720
It's mapped a spiral structure
similar to that of the Milky Way

43:47.880 --> 43:52.040
with such fine precision that
we've been able to calculate

43:52.120 --> 43:55.560
not only the motion
of Andromeda's stars,

43:55.640 --> 43:59.160
but also the motion
of the galaxy itself.

44:05.360 --> 44:10.360
And we now know that the entire galaxy
is heading towards us

44:10.760 --> 44:14.760
at over 400,000 kilometres per hour.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.640
Now, you may think,
"Well, what's one more collision?"

44:29.720 --> 44:32.080
I mean, the Milky Way
has survived all these collisions

44:32.160 --> 44:34.760
for pretty much
the entire history of the universe.

44:35.240 --> 44:40.200
Well, this one will be different
because Andromeda is bigger than us.

44:51.080 --> 44:55.520
The Milky Way, as we know it today,
will not be immortal

45:00.560 --> 45:03.640
and the earth will witness its demise.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.920
Two galaxies in a single sky,

45:17.000 --> 45:21.880
gradually but inexorably
merging into one.

46:08.800 --> 46:14.040
In the impact, there will be
a last colossal burst of star formation.

46:21.880 --> 46:25.160
But this will be very different
to previous collisions.

46:31.960 --> 46:36.360
This time our galaxy
will meet its match.

47:03.680 --> 47:07.760
The great galaxies will distort
each of the spiral arms.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.240
Stars will be scattered

47:14.480 --> 47:19.080
until no traces
of the original structures remain.

48:01.400 --> 48:05.120
The Milky Way's fate is sealed.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.920
Andromeda will be the first
of a series of mergers

48:11.000 --> 48:14.840
as the remaining galaxies
in our local group converge,

48:14.920 --> 48:17.800
drawn together by gravity.

48:27.560 --> 48:31.840
But Hubble has allowed us
to see even further into the future.

48:33.840 --> 48:37.200
It's looked out
far beyond the local group,

48:37.280 --> 48:40.480
towards the edge
of the observable universe,

48:40.560 --> 48:46.160
and seen that every distant galaxy
Is receding from us.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.440
In a final twist

48:58.520 --> 49:03.120
these retreating galaxies
tell us something profound

49:03.200 --> 49:06.600
about the nature of the universe itself.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.320
We live in an expanding universe.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.400
In fact, we live in a universe
that's accelerating in its expansion.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.000
So, all the galaxies are
rushing away from each other,

49:20.080 --> 49:24.080
and in the far future, they'll be
rushing away from each other so fast

49:24.160 --> 49:28.160
that even if we sent
a beam of light out to the galaxies,

49:28.240 --> 49:29.560
it would never catch them.

49:47.200 --> 49:51.480
Billions of years from now,
the remnants of the Milky Way will form

49:51.560 --> 49:55.480
part of a single,
gigantic collection of stars...

50:02.240 --> 50:05.720
The merged remains
of the local group...

50:09.800 --> 50:15.760
Alone, as every other galaxy
recedes into the distance.

50:24.680 --> 50:30.600
Eventually, all the galaxies
will fade from view,

50:30.680 --> 50:37.680
and our galaxy will stand at last
in perfect isolation...

50:39.920 --> 50:44.040
An island unto itself.

50:52.120 --> 50:56.280
I think we live at a fortunate time
in the history of the universe

50:56.360 --> 50:59.760
because we can look into the sky
and see the galaxies.

50:59.960 --> 51:04.120
The astronomers of the far future might
imagine that they live in a universe

51:04.200 --> 51:08.680
populated by countless billions
of islands of billions of stars.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.040
But they won't be able to prove it.

51:11.360 --> 51:17.280
They won't be able to see the true scale
and majesty of the universe.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.800
We've been trying to understand
the band of stars

51:45.880 --> 51:49.240
that stretches across the night sky
since the time of the ancient Greeks.

51:51.320 --> 51:54.800
The story
of our galaxy, the Milky Way,

51:54.880 --> 51:59.040
how it started, how it was formed,
and how it's transformed

51:59.120 --> 52:01.440
is really the story of us.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.960
Inside the Milky Way,
you always have

52:04.040 --> 52:07.520
a slightly skewed perspective
of the way the Milky Way looks.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.040
So, we're in it. And so,
what we would like to do

52:10.120 --> 52:12.680
is go above it and look down
and see what it's like.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.760
Now, you can't do that
unless you could travel

52:14.840 --> 52:16.560
at millions of times the speed of light.

52:16.640 --> 52:18.640
We can't.
So, the only way we can do it

52:18.720 --> 52:22.480
is by working out accurately
where all the stars are,

52:22.560 --> 52:25.080
how far away they are,
from us, in particular.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.880
Gaia is
a European Space Agency spacecraft,

52:38.960 --> 52:41.320
which is, in principle,
a very simple little thing.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.520
It's two telescopes
collecting the light,

52:43.600 --> 52:45.560
putting it down onto one giant camera,

52:45.640 --> 52:47.480
biggest camera
ever put in space, actually.

52:50.120 --> 52:52.760
It can observe
the positions of stars so accurately

52:52.840 --> 52:56.720
that you could see the edge of
a Euro coin on the moon from Earth,

52:56.800 --> 52:59.000
and that is just mind-blowing.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.240
It was a beautiful launch.
Really spectacular.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.920
And then it got into
this critical state

53:25.000 --> 53:27.040
where they had to
open up the sun shields.

53:27.120 --> 53:31.880
It was critical that this opened up
and protect the payload from the sun.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.400
And that was the do-or-die moment.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.240
There's the good news.

53:51.560 --> 53:53.200
Gaia works
by measuring parallax.

53:53.240 --> 53:56.080
This is exactly the same way
your eyes and brain work

53:56.160 --> 53:58.720
so you can tell
how far away something is

53:58.800 --> 54:01.960
because of the slight difference
in angle from this eye to that eye.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.160
And so, what we do with Gaia

54:04.240 --> 54:07.360
is have a picture in the summer
and a picture in the winter,

54:07.440 --> 54:09.920
and in that stage, Gaia has gone
halfway around the sun.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.520
And so, its two eyes are twice
the radius of the earth's orbit apart.

54:14.920 --> 54:19.080
And that's how we do parallax.
All it is is a big version of your head.

54:26.640 --> 54:29.960
The last data released from Gaia
was in December 2020,

54:30.040 --> 54:33.480
and what's been really exciting is that
we've been able to get the distances

54:33.560 --> 54:36.600
and the motions of the star
to a much better level of accuracy.

54:40.480 --> 54:43.040
Most of the stars
in the disk of the Milky Way

54:43.120 --> 54:44.520
all move in the same direction,

54:44.600 --> 54:47.680
rotating clockwise
around the centre of the galaxy.

54:48.560 --> 54:52.000
And one of the most exciting things
that came out of the first data release

54:52.080 --> 54:55.720
was that a large sample of stars
were found that seemed to be rotating

54:55.800 --> 54:58.360
in the opposite direction
to the majority of stars

54:58.440 --> 55:01.920
in the Milky Way disk,
and that's really surprising.

55:05.160 --> 55:07.440
They probably came from
a different galaxy altogether.

55:07.520 --> 55:10.400
So, they're almost these alien stars
that have been brought in.

55:13.720 --> 55:15.560
Alien stars from galaxies

55:15.640 --> 55:19.760
that, long ago, shared
our own corner of the universe.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.960
The important thing to know
about our galactic neighbours

55:24.040 --> 55:26.280
is that nothing's
actually sitting still.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.560
We're all moving towards
or away from each other.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.720
We're sort of playing a dance out there.

55:34.680 --> 55:36.920
And driving
the dance of the galaxies

55:37.000 --> 55:40.560
is the universe's
most elusive form of matter.

55:42.800 --> 55:46.200
Dark matter is something
that has gravity, but produces no light.

55:46.280 --> 55:51.040
It surrounds us. In fact, it dominates
the mass in our own galaxy.

55:51.120 --> 55:56.080
And yet, we don't know what it is.
We can't touch it. We can't feel it.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.960
We were able to start
measuring very accurately

56:01.080 --> 56:03.360
the way stars move
from radial velocities,

56:03.440 --> 56:05.320
that's just towards and away from us,

56:05.400 --> 56:08.560
and this allowed us to
measure accurately for the first time

56:08.640 --> 56:11.000
how the dark matter
was distributed near us.

56:13.720 --> 56:17.040
The team have pieced together
how dark matter orchestrated

56:17.120 --> 56:19.760
a series of galactic collisions...

56:22.240 --> 56:24.600
that spanned billions of years.

56:27.480 --> 56:30.400
Dark matter is really important
in galaxy collisions

56:30.480 --> 56:31.720
because it's so abundant.

56:31.800 --> 56:32.920
So, it's really driving

56:33.000 --> 56:35.680
the gravitational interaction
between the galaxies.

56:41.680 --> 56:45.120
It is dark matter that determines
how violent a collision is,

56:45.200 --> 56:47.720
how rapidly, and with what intensity

56:47.800 --> 56:50.040
galaxies come together
when they collide.

56:52.680 --> 56:58.000
In many ways, it determines
how galaxies end up after a collision.

57:02.960 --> 57:04.640
So, the thing
that Gaia showed us.

57:04.720 --> 57:08.880
Is not that it's plausible that
this happened. It showed it did happen.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.440
It happened in just this way.

57:10.520 --> 57:13.640
So, it's not speculation any more.
It's quantitative science.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.600
The galaxy is a dynamic thing.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.760
It's a living organism, if you want.

57:21.840 --> 57:25.560
It is breathing. It is changing.
It is transforming.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.960
It's all
coming together in the end

57:32.040 --> 57:33.960
to tell us about how we got here

57:34.040 --> 57:36.360
and what our place
in the universe really is.
