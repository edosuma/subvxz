10:43.435 --> 10:44.644
Mitch is my manager.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.187
So, fast-forward to this morning.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.481
I get the car back, I check the tank.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.317
Three-quarters full.
Quahog, we have a problem.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.529
(laughs)
Stewie, you're so funny.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.739
It's from a movie.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.782
Anyway, that's a 150% markup.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.659
Turns out he was late
for a flight and figured

10:59.743 --> 11:01.411
it's worth it to eat the nine bucks.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.497
So, yeah, a Wednesday
I won't soon be forgetting.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.792
-One check fine?
-$15 on this, the rest on theirs.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.631
-I like them.
-Hmm?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.759
Aaron and Shauna.
They're nice. I like them.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.053
-Yeah.
-It's comfortable going out with people

11:18.136 --> 11:20.722
in the same socioeconomic class
as us, you know?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.557
I mean, I love the Burtons,
but I don't really like

11:22.640 --> 11:24.684
to go to dinner parties in apartments.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.645
Apartment no worse than room in house.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.898
You're having a lot of those tonight.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.525
I think there's a new This Is Us.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.736
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.446
Babe, no.
Our show.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.947
(grunting)

11:39.949 --> 11:41.659
What's Kate up to this week?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.328
Losing weight with Toby maybe?

11:43.411 --> 11:46.373
Why you not have sex with me?

11:46.456 --> 11:47.916
No, I know.
I totally want to.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.168
It's just, it's our show, you know?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.670
We watch show later.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.588
Uh, and we sleep... when?

11:53.672 --> 11:56.091
Uh, th-there's just
only so many hours in the day.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.842
-You know?
-No more putting off.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.220
Sex now.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.806
Wait, wait, wait.
Black man in glasses?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.016
Yes, yes.
It's a Sterling Brown episode.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.144
I like Black man in glasses.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.109
Okay, now we don't have
a room key for this hotel,

12:14.192 --> 12:15.443
so follow my lead.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.070
They didn't even ask at the last place.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.114
Yeah, but we had one
and we carried ourselves

12:19.197 --> 12:22.325
-with key card confidence.
-So, what's the plan?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.160
-Let's try hello.
-Got it.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.787
Good morning, how may I help you?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.539
Hello...

12:27.622 --> 12:29.749
Good morning,
I'm staying here with my son,

12:29.833 --> 12:32.085
the Guinness record holder

12:32.168 --> 12:34.212
We were just wondering,
where's your breakfast buffet?

12:34.295 --> 12:37.215
-Just through those doors.
-Thank you.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.801

-What is it?
-Nothing, it's just...

Levi, where you been, man?

15:09.993 --> 15:11.661
Look, I already gave you a verbal warning,

15:11.745 --> 15:13.580
so I'm gonna have to write you up.

Levi, don't call me that.
Don't-don't use that word.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.834
Stop-stop using that word.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.294
I already warned you about calling me that

Okay, now that's strike two, Levi.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.008
I can, too, give strikes.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.345
Mitch said I can give strikes.
Don't call Mitch that.

Listen, I can't talk about this right now.

My dog is banging my wife.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.850
I'm not gonna write him up.
He's the only one strong enough

15:33.933 --> 15:36.061
to change the water jugs.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.650
Look, Stewie, I'm sorry.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.486

Once they say "I do," they don't.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.201
Stewie, don't be mad.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.452
Don't be mad?
