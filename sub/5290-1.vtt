00:50.885 --> 00:53.979
<i>Welcome to Wichita
Mid-Continent Airport.</i>

00:54.088 --> 00:58.525
<i>Convenient, friendly, affordable.
Fly with us.</i>

01:02.897 --> 01:07.960
<i>Please note, the Kansas Clean Air Act has
designated this airport as non-smoking.</i>

01:19.480 --> 01:23.041
<i>Your attention, please.
Baggage claim is located</i>

01:23.150 --> 01:24.947
<i>on the east side of the terminal.</i>

01:25.052 --> 01:27.418
<i>Hotel and ground transportation
information boards</i>

01:27.521 --> 01:31.924
<i>and public telephones are located
opposite the baggage carousels.</i>

01:46.740 --> 01:49.538
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please maintain visual contact</i>

01:49.643 --> 01:52.237
<i>with your personal property at all times.</i>

01:52.346 --> 01:56.646
<i>Please do not leave your baggage
or other items unattended.</i>

01:56.750 --> 01:58.945
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

02:26.780 --> 02:28.008
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.811
So, I'm gonna make it
onto the earlier flight, right?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.112
Are you gonna check that?

02:32.219 --> 02:34.153
No, I'm gonna carry it on.
It's got valuables in it.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.222
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.535
- God, excuse me.
- No, I'm sorry.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.875
That bag is wicked heavy, anyhow.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.473
I was looking at my phone.
I hate it when people do that.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.519
You have a little

03:11.892 --> 03:13.325
smudge.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.264
What are these?

03:27.374 --> 03:31.003
Those are two barrel carburetors
for a Pontiac Tri-Power.

03:36.283 --> 03:39.081
Those are exhaust tips for a '74 Z-28.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.119
I restore old cars, so...

03:45.893 --> 03:47.656
Hair-dryer.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.829
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.974
- This is getting to be a habit.
- Yeah, it is.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.874
Sorry about that.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.106
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.352
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.854
- Boston?
- Yeah.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.714
Gate 12.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.317
- Enjoy your flight, Mr. Garcia.
- Thank you.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.417
Hi.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.489
I'm sorry. You're not on this flight.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.492
Well, I just checked in
for this one, like, 10 minutes ago.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.069
That must be some sort of mistake.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.297
I'm sorry,
the computer shows that we're booked.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.237
Listen, Sharry.

04:34.341 --> 04:37.208
Tomorrow my little sister's
getting married. I practically raised her.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.302
I'm sorry, we are completely sold out.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.780
Listen, can you help me out for a second?
She's my little sister.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.145
She's April, I'm June,

04:44.251 --> 04:46.219
she's counting on me
to march her down the aisle tomorrow.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.685
That's very sweet,

04:47.788 --> 04:50.382
but the 11:50 will get you there
tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.017
Your boarding pass, sir?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.989
Sometimes things happen for a reason.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.766
- Enjoy your flight, Mr. Miller.
- Thank you.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.904
<i>This is the final boarding call
for US Midland Air, flight 77</i>

05:06.006 --> 05:10.170
<i>non-stop service to Boston's
Logan Airport, now boarding at gate 12.</i>

05:10.277 --> 05:12.837
<i>Would all passengers holding
a valid boarding pass, please proceed...</i>

05:12.946 --> 05:17.349
I should've seen it coming, boss.
He went on tilt, he came undone.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.919
Coming undone in our business
means you need a margarita.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.217
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people
in a government lab and blowing it up.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.792
<i>It doesn't mean stealing an object
of critical importance.</i>

05:25.893 --> 05:28.384
<i>- Does he have the Zephyr or not?
- We believe so.</i>

05:30.197 --> 05:32.062
You believe so.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.600
<i>- Check it out.
- I don't care what you believe, Fitz.</i>

05:34.702 --> 05:36.693
<i>- I need you to clean your mess up.
- Go back and play it again.</i>

05:36.804 --> 05:37.896
<i>I want the Zephyr.</i>

05:38.005 --> 05:40.405
We'll have it in hand
by the time he lands in Boston.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.738
Find out who and what she is.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.610
Should I have the field office pick her up
in Wichita?

05:47.715 --> 05:48.909
I got a better idea.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.011
Miss Havens? We did find a seat for you.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.584
<i>I'd like to have your attention, please.
We apologize for the delay.</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:03.220
<i>We will be departing
Wichita Airport shortly.</i>

06:03.330 --> 06:05.230
<i>Thanks for your patience.</i>

06:08.869 --> 06:11.269
I know it's policy or whatever
and it's just your job,

06:11.372 --> 06:14.239
- but it's kind of lame.
- Again, I apologize.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.673
Fitz. What did you do?

06:20.214 --> 06:23.581
It's no wonder these airlines
are going out of business.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.584
<i>We have been cleared onto the runway.</i>

06:25.686 --> 06:27.119
There's nobody on the plane.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.293
<i>The captain has turned on
the "fasten seatbelt" sign.</i>

06:38.399 --> 06:40.731
<i>Please remain seated
until the sign has been turned off</i>

06:40.834 --> 06:43.132
<i>and it's safe to move about the cabin.</i>

06:43.937 --> 06:45.598
I'm June, by the way.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.230
I'm Roy Miller.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.734
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.804
Tequila on the rocks?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.040
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.386
So, your sister's
getting married tomorrow?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.413
- Excuse me?
- Your sister.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.049
She's getting married tomorrow.
Congratulations.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.991
Yeah, thanks.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.793
You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.837
I'm sorry, how's that?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.668
April is getting married,
but not till Saturday.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.968
You had me fooled.

07:22.075 --> 07:27.479
Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow.
So, I do, actually, have to go home.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.348
I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.028
It might be.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.567
Wichita is a long way to go
for a carburetor.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.103
It's not just any carburetor.
It's a triple deuce.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.600
I'm restoring a '66 GTO.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.107
And Kansas has the best scrap.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.370
Really?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.002
My dad had a garage,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.910
and when I was a kid,
he bought this chassis.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.974
He used to take us to yards,
and search for parts, you know?

08:06.487 --> 08:07.715
He died in '98,

08:07.821 --> 08:13.191
and now that April's getting married,
I just figured, why not finish it up,

08:13.293 --> 08:15.454
give it to her sort of as a wedding present?

08:16.230 --> 08:19.961
Kind of like a present
from our dad, too, you know?

08:20.067 --> 08:21.694
That's nice.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.531
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.178
I used to think that

08:37.417 --> 08:41.352
someday, when the last part went in,

08:42.356 --> 08:45.723
I would just climb into that GTO
and start it up.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.324
Just drive and drive and drive,
and just keep driving

08:50.430 --> 08:53.695
until I got to the tip of South America.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.670
- Cape Horn.
- Yeah.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.637
- There's beautiful islands down there.
- Yeah?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.505
Pirate islands.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.781
Yeah, "someday."
That's a dangerous word.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.384
Dangerous?

09:12.452 --> 09:15.615
It's really just code for "never."

09:18.559 --> 09:21.756
I think a lot about things I haven't done.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.889
Dive in the Great Barrier Reef.
Ride the Orient Express.

09:26.733 --> 09:31.067
Live on the Amalfi Coast with nothing
but a motorcycle and a backpack.

09:31.939 --> 09:35.033
Kiss a stranger on the balcony
of the Hotel Du Cap.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.205
Where is that?

09:39.313 --> 09:41.144
South of France.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.950
What about you? What's your list?

09:49.456 --> 09:52.789
Well, yours sounds pretty good.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.025
Wow.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.200
Thanks.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.268
It's no problem.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.170
I'll just put this up here, if that's all right.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.538
You know what?

10:13.647 --> 10:16.673
I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.043
- I'll help you.
- Thanks.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.719
Lots of turbulence, huh?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.536
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Sure

10:48.148 --> 10:51.606
"Kiss a stranger on the balcony
of the Hotel Du Cap"?

10:51.718 --> 10:53.310
I mean, what kind of a line is that?

10:58.191 --> 11:01.957
I mean, it's, like, a really good line.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.857
Ma'am? Ma'am?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.173
Did you see his hands, by any chance?

11:17.277 --> 11:20.075
They just, like, snatched that bag
right out of the air.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.045
Lightning-fast reflexes.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.847
Not cool.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.485
Okay.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.167
This will help.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.461
Enough. It's over, Roy.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.421
Yeah, I agree. Enough.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.261
Where's the Zephyr?

12:34.321 --> 12:37.449
Why is the girl on the plane? Tell me.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.320
Why did Fitz put her on the plane?

12:42.295 --> 12:43.853
Don't move, Miller.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.237
So what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

12:58.345 --> 13:01.109
You're just gonna
let this opportunity pass you by?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.181
No, of course you're not.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.546
You're gonna walk right through that door,
you're gonna get it right.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.948
It's not your first rodeo, woman.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.588
Hey.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.667
I decided to join you.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.830
I'm sorry. I...

13:59.940 --> 14:02.932
- No, no, don't... It's great.
- I'm sorry.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.011
It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude
and everything.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.408
There's something I've gotta tell you.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.040
What? Oh, my God,
you're in a relationship. I'm so sorry.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.641
No, no, no. That's not it.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.653
Okay, I'm all ears. What is it?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.218
Are we landing?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.758
No, not yet.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.658
No?

14:25.765 --> 14:29.132
Listen, there's no need to panic. I have

14:30.437 --> 14:31.904
contained the situation.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.565
Situation?

14:35.308 --> 14:38.675
Yeah. We've lost the pilots.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.772
- Where did they go?
- I mean, they're dead.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.749
- The pilots are dead.
- Shot. It's...

14:45.852 --> 14:47.342
Shot?

14:49.756 --> 14:50.984
By who?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.621
Well, me.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.231
Actually, I shot the first pilot.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.960
He shot the second pilot accidentally.
It's just

15:04.971 --> 15:06.996
one of those things.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.981
Seriously, this is great!

15:26.526 --> 15:29.791
Really, I'm relieved
you are taking this so well.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.559
Where are you going?

15:36.670 --> 15:39.639
I'm just gonna go check on things
and think about landing.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.969
Would you mind
putting your seatbelt on for me?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.406
- That would be great.
- Yeah.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.757
This is weird.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.035
Mayday. Mayday.
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.772
What's happening?
Everybody's dead out there!

16:20.880 --> 16:24.509
Come on in. Sit down.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.608
- Everybody's dead in here.
- I'm declaring an emergency.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.086
- Oh, my God! Are we going down?
- I'm sorry?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.281
Are we going down?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.688
No, June, it's just a rapid descent.
Please, sit down.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.453
<i>Please state your emergency, Midland 77.</i>

16:34.561 --> 16:36.119
I'm sorry,
I think I've heard enough of this guy.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.322
Are you a pilot? Who are you?

16:38.431 --> 16:39.455
The shoulder straps.

16:39.566 --> 16:43.093
You can put those over,
and it clicks in right down there.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.694
You wanna click it right there, that's it.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.797
Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay...

16:48.908 --> 16:51.035
Gear down, showdown.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.442
Why can't we just land in an airport?

16:54.547 --> 16:57.141
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.912
- They'll be waiting for us.
- What do you mean? Waiting for us?

17:00.020 --> 17:02.682
- Who?
- I think the less you know, the better.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.050
What?

17:04.790 --> 17:07.123
Okay, we're gonna touch down here.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.457
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

17:15.300 --> 17:16.733
- That's a truck. That's a truck!
- Yeah.

17:16.836 --> 17:17.859
- That's a truck!
- Yup.

17:17.971 --> 17:18.994
That's a truck!

17:23.410 --> 17:25.037
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

17:29.949 --> 17:32.577
- That's a curve. That's a curve!
- I see it. I see it.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.290
Oh, my God!

17:43.029 --> 17:44.462
Oh, God!

18:00.447 --> 18:01.778
Okay, this is good.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.371
What's good?

18:06.820 --> 18:07.980
Take a sip of that.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.054
It'll take the edge off.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.189
- Are you shot?
- Yeah, how about that?

18:19.299 --> 18:22.632
It's just a scrape. That's good news.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.897
June, we have to

18:27.107 --> 18:29.371
discuss what's gonna happen next.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.138
You need to go to the hospital.
Prison, maybe?

18:32.245 --> 18:35.544
Some people are gonna come
looking for you now. Bad people.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.606
You know, I feel a little weird.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.948
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep,
which should be in a couple of minutes.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.817
- What?
- I need you to listen, June.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.480
Did you drug me?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.785
Yes.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.156
- You drugged me.
- Yeah, it's for your own good.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.592
Now, look. These bad people

18:49.696 --> 18:52.995
who are going to come and see you,
they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?

18:53.099 --> 18:55.397
And you need to tell them
you don't know me.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.833
- June? June?
- Okay.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.995
You need to tell them
you don't remember anything.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.006
And you need to avoid getting in
any vehicle with them at all costs.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.076
Okay, who are "them"?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.610
Well, they're serious people, June.

19:05.712 --> 19:09.443
They'll probably identify themselves
as federal agents, and they'll DIP you.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.780
Dip me? In what?

19:12.886 --> 19:15.013
Dis-Information Protocol.
They'll tell you a story about me.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.056
About how I'm mentally unstable,
paranoid.

19:19.626 --> 19:23.392
How I'm violent and dangerous,
and it'll all sound very convincing.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.827
I'm already convinced.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.332
There's a few common DIP keywords
to listen for.

19:28.434 --> 19:32.894
Reassuring words.
Words like, "stabilize," "secure," "safe."

19:33.006 --> 19:35.236
If they say these words,
particularly with repetition...

19:35.341 --> 19:36.569
Okay.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.075
...it means they're going to kill you.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.770
Oh, God!

19:39.879 --> 19:42.211
Or intern you somewhere offshore
for a very long time.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.748
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.750
Now, stay with me.
If they tell you you're safe...

19:45.852 --> 19:48.082
If they tell me I'm safe,

19:48.688 --> 19:50.212
they're gonna kill me.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.587
- Don't get in what?
- Vehicles.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.853
- Any vehicles.
- Okay, any vehicles.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.553
- Just run.
- I'll run.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.687
- Run.
- Run.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.322
And if they ask you about me...

20:02.035 --> 20:04.902
I don't know you. I don't know you at all.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.940
Who are you, Roy?

20:51.417 --> 20:54.944
<i>...a mixing of rain and snow,
good for ski country, but probably...</i>

20:56.356 --> 20:57.618
<i>- Thanks, Andrea.
- You're welcome.</i>

20:57.724 --> 20:59.589
<i>Now, back to our top news story
of the morning.</i>

20:59.692 --> 21:02.456
<i>Here's Bradley Moss,
with an on-the-scene report.</i>

21:02.562 --> 21:06.089
<i>According to FAA sources,
at approximately 7:30 last night,</i>

21:06.199 --> 21:10.101
<i>all contact was lost with a
Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.</i>

21:10.203 --> 21:13.297
<i>The plane was apparently passing through
an area of turbulence</i>

21:13.406 --> 21:14.430
<i>and may have met up with wind shear</i>

21:14.540 --> 21:16.804
<i>or a lightning storm
causing an electrical failure.</i>

21:16.909 --> 21:19.343
<i>Now, this is all conjecture at this point,</i>

21:19.445 --> 21:21.470
<i>as all that's left is a crater
in an Indiana cornfield.</i>

21:21.581 --> 21:22.980
Coming!

21:29.722 --> 21:31.155
Rodney?

21:31.958 --> 21:34.825
Thank God.
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

21:34.927 --> 21:35.951
Yeah, why?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.290
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?

21:37.397 --> 21:39.262
- Yeah.
- I saw on the news about the crash.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.798
What news? What crash?

21:41.467 --> 21:44.630
- Anyway, you're alive.
- I'm alive, yeah.

21:44.737 --> 21:49.367
Sure, that's cool.
Hey, but, June, you know...

21:49.475 --> 21:52.137
I told myself that if I found you alive,

21:53.946 --> 21:55.208
that I was gonna ask you to dinner.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.215
How about I call you later, okay?

22:04.991 --> 22:09.018
It's just another day.
It's just a normal day. Okay.

22:13.633 --> 22:14.600
She's moving.

22:15.868 --> 22:16.994
Wow!

22:17.804 --> 22:19.999
And gotta love the boots.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.007
Yeah, you know.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.475
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.478
- Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.945
So, this weekend,
I was thinking about Dad's GTO.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.480
- Really?
- Yeah, it's just sitting there.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.686
And I was wondering how you would feel
about maybe selling it.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.828
You wanna sell Dad's GTO?

22:44.931 --> 22:47.627
Ben and I, we really want our own place.

22:47.734 --> 22:48.860
Excuse me?

22:48.968 --> 22:52.768
Excuse me. Anyone here belong
to that blue truck parked outside?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.033
- Yeah, why?
- You're about to get a ticket.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.772
- Thought I put enough quarters in there.
- Yeah.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.936
I hate getting tickets.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.146
Excuse me.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.812
Please step inside, miss.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.120
Let me just go grab a few things.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.457
Miss Havens, good afternoon.
Special Agent-in-Charge, Fitzgerald.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.531
Will you join us inside the car
for a moment?

23:20.433 --> 23:22.663
We know you were on the flight
with him last night.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.995
The one that crashed.

23:28.007 --> 23:28.996
Who are you again?

23:29.675 --> 23:32.940
FBI. You do know Mr. Miller.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.740
No, I don't.

23:40.586 --> 23:45.182
Well, we chatted a little bit
before security, but...

23:45.291 --> 23:50.160
I see. And once you were on the flight,
what happened then? More chatting?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.360
- Is this funny to you?
- No.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.434
He's dangerous, Miss Havens,
and out of control.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.637
He said that you'd say he was crazy.

24:01.741 --> 24:04.175
So, you did talk to him.
And about me, no less.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.939
No. No, not you, specifically.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.775
About whom, then?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.277
Simon Feck?

24:11.384 --> 24:14.182
I don't know who that is.

24:14.287 --> 24:20.089
Look, this is getting really twisted around,
and I think I should probably call a lawyer.

24:26.866 --> 24:31.132
We're gonna take you to a secure location,
Miss Havens, until Miller is contained.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.534
Someplace safe.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.807
- With you?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.254
You wanna tell me where we're going?

24:51.357 --> 24:53.951
- Fellas?
- Don't worry, miss, you're safe.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.784
Excuse me?

24:56.596 --> 24:57.858
You're safe with us.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.363
I wanna know where we're going.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.933
Just a shortcut
till the situation is stabilized.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.599
We'll keep you safe.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.137
You said that already.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.370
Because I meant it.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.610
What is Jackson doing?

25:15.147 --> 25:18.913
Shooter! Shooter! Evade! Evade!
Shooter on the freeway.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.212
The dot's on your back!

25:24.357 --> 25:25.415
Follow me, now!

25:25.525 --> 25:27.288
Are you insane?
I'm not going out that door!

25:36.736 --> 25:38.601
Oh, my God!

25:39.305 --> 25:40.294
Get your foot off...

25:56.155 --> 25:58.180
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, June!

25:58.291 --> 26:00.486
- I can't see!
- You are doing great.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.925
- I can't see! Get out of the way!
- Open the door.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.724
- I can't get his foot off the gas.
- Open the door, June.

26:04.830 --> 26:07.731
Open the door, June.
That's a beautiful dress, by the way.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.631
One second.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.431
Oh, my God!

26:25.484 --> 26:30.922
I totally know what you're talking about.
It's so boring, I can't even stand it. Totally.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.115
Thank you.

26:38.331 --> 26:39.821
Who are you?

26:41.901 --> 26:43.061
Oh, God!

26:43.869 --> 26:45.063
What are you doing?

26:50.910 --> 26:52.571
- Hi, June.
- Move out of the way, I can't see!

26:52.678 --> 26:54.270
Please unlock the door, June.

26:56.582 --> 26:59.142
Unlock the door. That way, I can help you.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.082
- I can't let go!
- You need to let go, June.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.360
- June, door!
- Got it!

27:32.385 --> 27:34.649
Just pull over! Oh, my God!

27:45.665 --> 27:49.931
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Yup, come over here.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.027
Right over here.
Just stay down, you're doing good.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.732
Here, hold this. Well, well, well.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.364
Check this out.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.276
Nice.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.538
These guys are loaded for bear.

28:00.646 --> 28:01.738
You're doing well, June.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.873
Excellent driving.
Over a dead guy, no less.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.178
You're a natural.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.211
That's a beautiful dress.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.578
Is that for April's wedding?

28:10.690 --> 28:12.385
- Saturday?
- Yeah.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.924
- Yeah, that will be nice.
- Yeah.

28:17.830 --> 28:21.391
Please, stop shooting people, okay?

28:21.500 --> 28:24.333
- Just stop shooting people.
- I understand.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.064
You're in shock.

28:26.672 --> 28:28.765
How about you stay here

28:28.874 --> 28:31.570
while I go have a word
with the guys in the tunnel.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.167
- Okay?
- Okay.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.144
- Okay?
- Okay.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.738
Actually, I'm just gonna go shoot them.
I'll be right back.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.320
By the way,
your timing when you opened that door...

28:42.421 --> 28:44.412
- Okay.
...was sublime.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.150
You saved us, I hope you know that.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.226
- You saved us.
- Okay.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.050
Hey! Hey!

29:17.156 --> 29:18.555
Oh, shoot.

29:23.729 --> 29:24.855
Hey, wait!

29:30.536 --> 29:32.060
Wait! Wait! Wait!

30:05.437 --> 30:07.132
Oh, no.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.139
Excuse me, sorry.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.065
There you are.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.443
June?

30:15.247 --> 30:16.942
June?

30:25.724 --> 30:28.784
- Rodney?
- He's in the gym. Over there.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.695
- Hey!
- Hey!

30:32.431 --> 30:33.455
What are you doing here?

30:33.933 --> 30:37.232
Whoa! That's a...
Hey, guys, say hello to June.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.463
- That's a dress.
- Thanks.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.403
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.304
No, it's...

30:44.710 --> 30:45.870
It's complicated.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.344
You know what?
I've been feeling the same way.

30:48.714 --> 30:49.908
You wanna talk?

30:50.015 --> 30:51.710
Maybe over some pie?

30:54.086 --> 30:55.485
My point is...

30:55.588 --> 30:58.580
My point is,
that plane crash made me think

30:58.691 --> 30:59.817
about our break-up.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.353
You know, this bulb went off, bing!

31:02.461 --> 31:04.759
"Rodney, why are you giving up?
You're being passive."

31:04.864 --> 31:06.729
"Getting back at her
because she didn't want the ring."

31:06.832 --> 31:09.027
"So June didn't want
to be engaged right now,

31:09.134 --> 31:10.692
"and that freaks your mom out. Big deal!

31:10.803 --> 31:13.237
"What about all the things you
and June wanted to do together, huh?"

31:13.339 --> 31:14.499
Our list, you know?

31:14.607 --> 31:17.371
Like camping in Vermont with my brother
and Sheila in their new Winnie.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.307
Tickets to Blue Man Group,
the battlegrounds tour.

31:19.411 --> 31:22.107
I wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay?

31:24.149 --> 31:25.207
Sure, what about it?

31:25.317 --> 31:28.115
I was on it. I mean, in it.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.380
I mean, I was in it.

31:29.488 --> 31:30.955
So you were in the plane crash?

31:31.056 --> 31:32.853
I wasn't supposed to be on that plane,
but I was on it,

31:32.958 --> 31:37.918
and there was this guy who was some sort
of secret agent or something, and he...

31:39.265 --> 31:40.994
He killed everybody on board.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.303
And then he landed the plane.
Next thing you know,

31:45.404 --> 31:48.305
I wake up, I'm in my room.
I have no idea how I got there.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.568
He must've drugged me or something.
Then I go to April's fitting,

31:50.676 --> 31:52.701
because I have to wear
this ridiculous dress.

31:52.811 --> 31:55.302
These other guys, these other agents
come, they snatch me up.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.076
<i>Next thing you know,
I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the l-93.</i>

31:58.183 --> 32:00.845
- Why are you touching my hand?
- Because I'm here for you.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.217
- Jeez, you are so stressed out!
- Well, yeah!

32:03.322 --> 32:04.914
- And I get it.
- Really?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.286
I completely understand. I mean...

32:07.326 --> 32:08.691
- Wow, June.
- I know.

32:08.794 --> 32:11.262
- Your little sister's getting married...
- It's like...

32:11.363 --> 32:13.422
...and that is stressful.
- What are you talking about, Rodney?

32:13.532 --> 32:15.227
You didn't even listen
to what I was talking about.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.428
No, I did. Look, I would probably be
the same way in that situation.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.835
What can I do to help? Setting up?
We can bring the guys over...

32:20.940 --> 32:23.408
No, no, no. Okay.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.737
Oh, Christ.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.936
Hi, June. Look, I...

32:28.047 --> 32:29.981
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting anything, but...

32:31.150 --> 32:32.276
I'm Roy Miller.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.277
Rodney Burris.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.752
Rodney, hi. How are you?

32:37.957 --> 32:41.290
We're running out of time,
and maybe I didn't make it clear enough,

32:41.393 --> 32:45.830
but we're gonna have to stick together
for a little bit, because of our...

32:45.931 --> 32:47.523
You know, our situation.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.934
In case you didn't notice,
Rodney is a fireman, okay?

32:51.036 --> 32:54.597
So he's perfectly capable of handling
any situation that comes up.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.504
Thank you very much,
you can leave us alone.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.802
I have no doubt.

32:57.910 --> 33:01.676
Ever since I was a little kid,
I have great respect for firemen.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.748
- I appreciate it.
- Fact of the matter is,

33:03.849 --> 33:05.646
- I don't think you guys get paid enough.
- Yeah, we don't.

33:05.751 --> 33:06.775
You're in Engine 10.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.880
Yeah, Engine 10.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.047
Yeah. Have you taken
your lieutenant's exam yet?

33:11.156 --> 33:13.989
- I'm working on it.
- Yeah? How's that going?

33:14.093 --> 33:15.355
It's a bitch.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.258
Did you ever do a tour in that hall,
what is it?

33:17.396 --> 33:21.492
Grove Hall, that's where the action is.
It's the fastest way up the ladder.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.625
- Rodney!
- House of Flames!

33:24.670 --> 33:26.535
I often thought I...

33:28.974 --> 33:31.067
I should have been a fireman.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.805
Rodney, this is the guy.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.106
What?

33:38.317 --> 33:40.751
- This is the guy.
- What? "This is the guy"?

33:41.653 --> 33:43.280
I'm sorry, who are you?

33:45.591 --> 33:46.922
I'm the guy?

33:48.227 --> 33:49.717
- I'm the guy. This is the guy.
- This is the guy.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.261
- This is the guy.
- I'm a guy.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.830
- I'm the guy.
- You are a guy.

33:52.931 --> 33:55.900
- I'm a guy.
- He's the guy! He's the guy!

33:56.001 --> 33:58.697
- Rodney, whatever happens...
- God.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.772
- Please, for your own safety...
- Rodney, whatever happens,

34:00.873 --> 34:02.306
- you should know...
...please stay in the booth.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.137
What are you talking about?

34:05.544 --> 34:06.511
Wait!

34:06.612 --> 34:08.842
Everybody! Everybody get down.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.438
Get down, down, down! Everybody down.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.280
Rodney, get down,
or I will blow her head off.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.784
I'll blow her head off.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.253
What did I say?

34:18.357 --> 34:19.824
Rodney, what did I say?

34:19.925 --> 34:21.688
- Just calm down, buddy.
- Answer!

34:24.263 --> 34:26.288
Sorry, I thought you were making a move.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.599
Sorry. It's all right,
I thought he was making a move.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.397
Making a little pie.
Pies for everybody. Everybody.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.734
Everybody gets pies, okay?
No ice-cream, à la mode.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.105
Weakens the legs, people. Lincoln knew it.
It's why they got to him.

34:38.577 --> 34:42.206
No one follows us,
or I kill myself and then her.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.487
- Get in the car. Please.
- No.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.683
Watch your head.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.026
We're at 560 Harris.
They're getting into a blue Volvo.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.292
- Rodney! Rodney!
- Rodney?

35:08.474 --> 35:10.339
Oh, my God! Rodney!

35:11.510 --> 35:12.909
It's okay. Look at me.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.309
- Okay. Look at me, it's okay.
- Shit!

35:15.414 --> 35:18.406
I shot you through and through. No bone,
nowhere near the femoral artery, okay?

35:18.517 --> 35:19.506
All right?

35:19.618 --> 35:22.280
This is gonna be better for you
than Grove Hall. It's all good.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.651
Okay? You good?

35:24.756 --> 35:25.814
- Good?
- Good.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.152
Good?

35:46.912 --> 35:50.609
There were four security cameras
in that restaurant, June.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.809
Now there is proof you're my hostage.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.045
So we've cleared your name,
with the locals, at least.

35:55.154 --> 35:58.180
You know? It's a start.
Something to build on.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.384
- You shot Rodney!
- Yeah, I did.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.053
But I asked him to stay in the booth.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.322
You shot Rodney!

36:06.431 --> 36:08.456
It might be the best thing
that ever happened to him.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.593
Yeah, right, because we all should
get shot every now and then!

36:11.703 --> 36:14.797
Rodney... Rodney is a good guy, June.

36:14.907 --> 36:17.307
But not really right for you.

36:17.409 --> 36:20.401
I mean, you know, in my opinion.
But a good guy.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.879
Took a bullet, he's gonna be a hero.
Probably get a promotion.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.711
- Stop the car. Stop the car.
- What?

36:25.817 --> 36:28.217
Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car. Just stop the car!

36:28.320 --> 36:30.481
June, I understand
you want off the carousel.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.716
I do, I wanna get off the carousel.
Please, Roy.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.655
Can you stop the car, please? Right now!

36:34.760 --> 36:36.751
I'm not one of those
"I told you so" kind of guys,

36:36.862 --> 36:39.524
but I did warn you
to stay off the plane last night.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.623
When?

36:41.733 --> 36:45.169
Well, when I said,
"Sometimes things happen for a reason."

36:47.005 --> 36:50.873
That's not a warning.
That's not a warning, Roy!

36:50.976 --> 36:54.343
That's like a needlepoint expression
or a bumper sticker.

36:54.446 --> 36:58.610
Next time, try, "June, if you get
on this plane, you will fucking die!"

36:59.885 --> 37:02.820
You know, Roy, maybe they meant it
when they said that I would be safe.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.257
- You really mean that, June?
- Yeah!

37:07.259 --> 37:11.958
- Did you feel safe with them?
- Safer than I do now!

37:12.064 --> 37:14.828
Okay, okay. All right.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.417
Just so you understand,

37:41.526 --> 37:45.326
right now, out there, on your own,
your life expectancy is like here.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.921
With me, it's here. Without me, here.

37:48.033 --> 37:51.867
With me, without me.
With me, without me.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.597
So...

37:53.705 --> 37:57.072
I wouldn't advise going home.
But, you know, it's up to you.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.870
So right now I need another car,
keep moving.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.176
Someone else is depending on me.
Someone whose life is in danger.

38:02.281 --> 38:05.910
Someone who trusts me.
Every second I waste chasing you,

38:06.485 --> 38:08.817
I'm letting him down.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.095
<i>Rodney, why did you make this brave call
to leap into action?</i>

38:59.204 --> 39:00.228
<i>Well, I didn't think.</i>

39:00.339 --> 39:02.603
<i>I just did what any man would do
in that situation, you know?</i>

39:02.708 --> 39:04.403
<i>- I leapt into action.
- Thanks.</i>

39:04.509 --> 39:07.535
<i>- Like you said, it's really the job.
- You should be so proud.</i>

39:07.646 --> 39:08.772
<i>- Thanks.
- Good job.</i>

39:08.880 --> 39:11.508
<i>It really didn't even hurt.
It was kind of like a bee sting.</i>

39:11.616 --> 39:12.810
<i>What a brave firefighter.</i>

39:12.918 --> 39:16.820
<i>The doctors tell me Rodney is going
to be okay, just a flesh wound.</i>

39:16.922 --> 39:21.222
<i>A true blue Boston hero. Back to you, Don.</i>

39:36.842 --> 39:37.968
This is what it's all about.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.008
That, right there,
is what everybody wants.

39:43.648 --> 39:44.979
A Burger King toy?

39:47.085 --> 39:48.279
Open it up.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.318
It's warm. What is it?

39:59.131 --> 40:00.496
A battery.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.222
A battery?

40:03.301 --> 40:05.997
It's code-named Zephyr.
Not your average Duracell.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.440
It's high output. Never runs out.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.975
What do you mean, "never"?

40:12.077 --> 40:17.242
That little thing there is the first
perpetual energy source since the sun.

40:17.349 --> 40:21.285
So, what, your flashlight
never runs out of juice?

40:21.386 --> 40:23.877
It can power a lot more
than a flashlight, June.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.253
Really? How much more?

40:26.358 --> 40:29.384
Small city.

40:29.494 --> 40:30.961
Large submarine.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.155
It's big.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.794
The guy who invented it

40:37.369 --> 40:39.803
is barely out of high school.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.430
Simon Feck.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.568
I was assigned with another agent to
watch him at a facility, a lab in Wichita.

40:46.678 --> 40:50.808
And the other guy, the agent, is the guy
who picked you up this morning.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.746
Fitzgerald.

40:55.086 --> 41:00.183
A couple of weeks ago, I found out
he was going to sell the battery

41:00.292 --> 41:01.520
and kill Simon.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.424
So I got Simon out of there,

41:05.530 --> 41:09.193
put him someplace safe
and went back for the battery.

41:09.301 --> 41:13.965
And Fitz set me up.
Made it look like I went rogue.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.438
That's when I met you.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.279
So...

41:33.592 --> 41:36.527
So, what's next? I mean, what's the plan?

41:37.262 --> 41:38.627
I think we get some rest,

41:38.730 --> 41:42.427
pick up Simon, and get you back
for your sister's wedding.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.334
I'm pretty good at what I do, June.

41:48.440 --> 41:51.568
And tonight, we're safe.

41:52.444 --> 41:54.173
Scout's honor.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.473
Safe and secure?

42:05.156 --> 42:07.124
Good night, Roy.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.090
Were you really a Boy Scout?

42:15.066 --> 42:17.432
Eagle Scout.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.765
I was a Brownie.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.397
That's cool.

42:27.479 --> 42:29.447
Good night, Roy.

42:46.631 --> 42:48.223
<i>Pies for everybody. Everybody.</i>

42:48.333 --> 42:51.166
<i>Everybody gets pies, okay?
No ice-cream...</i>

42:52.637 --> 42:55.765
So, what do you think?
Are we looking at another player?

42:55.874 --> 42:59.640
We're looking at a pawn.
I talked to her, so did he.

42:59.744 --> 43:03.009
She owns a garage, no passport,
gone nowhere, been nowhere.

43:03.148 --> 43:04.740
She's a nobody.

43:04.849 --> 43:08.683
You've been two steps behind
since this began, Fitz.

43:08.787 --> 43:11.119
Are you sure someone
is not taking you to school?

43:11.222 --> 43:12.746
Clean this shit up.

43:32.377 --> 43:34.845
This is a safe-house?

43:36.348 --> 43:37.747
Simon!

43:45.023 --> 43:46.718
Simon?

43:51.096 --> 43:52.620
Stay close.

43:55.066 --> 43:58.832
Hey, Simon, this is no time to play.

44:12.350 --> 44:15.251
What is all this?

44:15.353 --> 44:18.151
Simon. It's what he does.

44:19.958 --> 44:22.256
I'm late, and he's gone.

45:12.077 --> 45:13.044
Simon.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.764
"Made in Austria."

45:52.083 --> 45:54.813
Who are these people?
Are they Fitzgerald's guys?

45:54.919 --> 45:57.387
No, it's other guys.

45:57.489 --> 45:59.286
Other bad guys?

45:59.390 --> 46:02.052
Worse guys. Hold my mags.

46:03.161 --> 46:04.856
Worse guys?

46:04.963 --> 46:08.399
Now, I need you to listen carefully.
Do exactly as I say.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.060
On three, I'm gonna lay down cover,

46:11.169 --> 46:13.160
then we're gonna run
to those shelves over there.

46:13.271 --> 46:14.238
Okay.

46:14.339 --> 46:15.306
- Okay?
- Yeah.

46:15.406 --> 46:16.703
- You ready?
- Yeah.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.002
One...

46:22.180 --> 46:24.045
Oh, my God!

46:24.549 --> 46:26.540
Sorry. I panicked.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.917
- What number would you like?
- Let's just stick with three, it's good.

46:31.022 --> 46:33.081
Okay. One... Two...

46:33.191 --> 46:34.351
Three.

46:46.371 --> 46:49.670
These guys are fancy. Mags.

46:49.774 --> 46:55.041
Could be Antonio Quintana's men.
He's a Spanish arms dealer.

46:55.146 --> 46:58.081
He also wants the battery.

46:58.183 --> 46:59.150
Ready?

46:59.250 --> 47:01.115
- Let's move.
- Okay.

47:02.921 --> 47:04.650
June. June!

47:05.924 --> 47:09.257
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

47:09.360 --> 47:10.918
And where the hell is Simon?

47:11.029 --> 47:12.394
I don't know yet, but he left a message.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.362
- A message?
- Wait.

47:21.739 --> 47:24.572
What I need you to do right now
is wait here.

47:24.676 --> 47:26.644
- What?
- Yeah. I'm gonna find us a way out.

47:26.744 --> 47:28.541
- I can't wait here!
- I'll be right back.

47:28.646 --> 47:29.635
Wait! Roy!

47:30.281 --> 47:31.543
Just take this.

47:43.795 --> 47:45.319
Roy?

47:46.264 --> 47:47.822
Shit.

47:49.968 --> 47:50.957
June?

47:52.070 --> 47:55.233
June! June! June! June!

47:56.074 --> 47:58.941
June! June! June! June!

48:02.046 --> 48:03.070
June!

48:03.181 --> 48:04.546
Please stop saying my name.

48:04.649 --> 48:06.412
You keep saying my name,
it's freaking me out.

48:07.919 --> 48:10.649
- Okay. I understand.
- Okay.

48:13.124 --> 48:14.216
- Drink this.
- What is it?

48:14.325 --> 48:16.293
Brotine-zero.
They're gonna smoke us with D-5.

48:16.394 --> 48:17.725
Oh, yeah.

48:19.797 --> 48:20.764
Where's yours?

48:24.702 --> 48:26.294
Oh, shit.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.701
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

48:27.805 --> 48:29.136
They're coming.

48:46.658 --> 48:47.625
June.

48:50.028 --> 48:52.895
I know this looks bad,

48:52.997 --> 48:55.761
but we'll be out of here

48:55.867 --> 48:58.836
in a couple of minutes.

48:58.937 --> 49:00.029
I got this.

49:05.576 --> 49:08.272
We gotta go, June. Here, I'll help you.

49:18.923 --> 49:20.322
We've been hit!

49:20.425 --> 49:22.620
But it's okay!

49:22.727 --> 49:25.127
We get through this, we're home free!

49:25.229 --> 49:27.754
Ready, set, go!

49:39.677 --> 49:41.702
We're almost there.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.057
Hey, there, sleepy head.

50:39.003 --> 50:40.061
How long have I been out?

50:40.738 --> 50:42.501
Eighteen hours.

50:44.409 --> 50:46.240
Where am I?

50:47.178 --> 50:49.146
My place.

50:50.948 --> 50:51.937
We're off-grid.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.484
No one's ever found me here.

50:55.019 --> 50:57.954
Shame we can't stay longer.
We got a rendezvous with Simon.

50:58.056 --> 51:00.957
He's fine. I figured out his code.

51:01.959 --> 51:03.392
He's crazy about trains.

51:03.494 --> 51:06.224
He used the passport I gave him
and went to Austria.

51:06.330 --> 51:07.388
You drugged me again, Roy.

51:08.666 --> 51:09.758
Yeah.

51:10.668 --> 51:11.828
You can't do that.

51:13.438 --> 51:16.236
Well, you weren't coping well.

51:16.340 --> 51:20.276
I'm not sure, if you were awake,
if they would've even let you live.

51:21.145 --> 51:22.134
What am I wearing?

51:26.851 --> 51:29.081
A bikini. We're in the tropics.

51:29.187 --> 51:31.280
How did I get in the bikini?

51:35.126 --> 51:39.290
June, I've been trained
to dismantle a bomb in the pitch black

51:39.397 --> 51:43.026
with nothing but a safety pin
and a Junior Mint.

51:43.134 --> 51:46.695
I think I can get you in and out
of some clothes without

51:47.738 --> 51:48.796
looking.

51:52.910 --> 51:55.344
I'm not saying that's what I did, but...

51:55.446 --> 51:58.438
Okay. Sorry. Reflex.

51:59.150 --> 52:01.880
I deserved that. Hit me again.

52:01.986 --> 52:03.783
I won't stop you.

52:05.590 --> 52:06.579
June.

52:09.060 --> 52:10.049
June?

52:12.597 --> 52:13.689
June!

52:15.032 --> 52:17.432
...paper clips and Junior Mints...

52:20.605 --> 52:22.573
"Not that I'm saying that's what I did."

52:25.610 --> 52:26.668
Shit!

52:32.750 --> 52:34.411
Is this his phone?

52:38.923 --> 52:40.322
Movement alert.

52:44.195 --> 52:45.389
Amapola.

52:47.298 --> 52:49.232
That's a '67 Grand Prix.

52:58.142 --> 53:00.372
I thought we were off the grid.

53:01.045 --> 53:02.171
April.

53:02.780 --> 53:03.906
April?

53:04.482 --> 53:09.146
April! I know! No, I'm okay!
Listen, April... April? April?

53:09.987 --> 53:12.512
April, can you hear me? April!

53:13.324 --> 53:14.951
April, can you...

53:23.868 --> 53:26.393
<i>I know! No, I'm okay!
Listen, April... April?</i>

53:26.504 --> 53:28.734
<i>April, can you hear me? April!</i>

53:30.608 --> 53:31.802
We don't know, Antonio.

53:31.909 --> 53:35.310
We traced her phone to the Azores.
We're in range now.

53:37.181 --> 53:39.411
Get to them before the agency.

53:46.691 --> 53:49.660
Perfect timing. Lunch is ready.

53:51.128 --> 53:52.857
You must be thirsty.

53:57.935 --> 54:00.802
It's coconut. It's loaded with electrolytes.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.503
Just... Whoa. Okay?

54:10.137 --> 54:11.126
Okay. Just... Whoa.

54:12.273 --> 54:13.297
Yeah?

54:14.375 --> 54:15.467
Yeah!

54:16.544 --> 54:18.307
Hey. You got skills.

54:20.614 --> 54:22.639
- My dad wanted boys.
- Yeah?

54:23.250 --> 54:26.481
- Let me go.
- You can get out anytime you want.

54:26.587 --> 54:28.077
I'll show you.

54:29.156 --> 54:31.147
Hands like Houdini.

54:31.258 --> 54:33.055
Turn your palms down,

54:33.461 --> 54:35.019
and all at once,

54:35.563 --> 54:38.726
throw your hands to the ground
and your hips back.

54:42.203 --> 54:43.261
Nice.

54:44.271 --> 54:45.704
That was good.

55:02.089 --> 55:03.454
Who are you?

55:05.626 --> 55:06.786
Really.

55:21.842 --> 55:23.332
I don't understand.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.040
Follow me.

55:42.062 --> 55:44.587
I don't understand. I came in clean.

55:46.467 --> 55:50.301
My phone is secure. It's secure.
Unless you made a call.

55:50.404 --> 55:53.601
- And you didn't make a call.
- No, I didn't make a call.

55:53.707 --> 55:55.197
I took a call.

55:57.478 --> 55:58.638
You took a call?

55:59.346 --> 56:00.404
It was a quick one.

56:00.848 --> 56:01.974
You...

56:04.718 --> 56:05.685
Come on.

56:06.787 --> 56:07.913
I thought we were off the grid,

56:08.022 --> 56:09.216
- and then the phone rang.
- It's okay.

56:09.323 --> 56:10.813
It was my sister and I had to take the call.

56:10.925 --> 56:14.190
- You know? I didn't want her to worry.
- Watch your step.

56:17.832 --> 56:19.060
No, no, no...

56:19.166 --> 56:21.191
I can't get into that.
I just can't get into that thing.

56:21.502 --> 56:22.799
I can't get into that.

56:24.405 --> 56:25.633
- June.
- Roy...

56:25.840 --> 56:28.968
Just, please, knock me out.
Use broton-seven or whatever.

56:29.677 --> 56:31.508
- It's okay.
- You're grabbing my neck.

56:31.612 --> 56:33.136
You asked me not to drug you.

56:33.481 --> 56:34.948
Okay, good.

56:45.526 --> 56:49.360
Hands like Houdini. Hands...

57:10.784 --> 57:11.808
Roy?

57:18.959 --> 57:21.427
- I can't feel my face!
- Okay, time.

57:21.629 --> 57:22.789
Okay, Simon...

57:24.598 --> 57:26.225
Roy, the pull on this thing...

57:26.333 --> 57:27.994
- We said 10 minutes.
- The traction on this thing.

57:28.102 --> 57:31.230
- It can pull up to 50,000 metric tons!
- I get it.

57:33.774 --> 57:34.832
It's a diesel hydraulic!

57:35.042 --> 57:36.737
Don't you wanna see your Zephyr?

57:37.478 --> 57:38.502
Yes.

57:54.128 --> 57:55.993
<i>- Excuse me.
- Guten Morgen, miss.</i>

57:56.096 --> 57:57.085
Can you tell me where we are?

57:57.197 --> 57:58.664
Right now, miss? We are in Austria.

57:59.099 --> 58:00.532
Austria, huh?

58:01.969 --> 58:04.164
Would you like some breakfast, miss?

58:04.271 --> 58:06.671
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

58:08.208 --> 58:10.574
Okay, I'm gonna have some pancakes,

58:10.678 --> 58:11.872
scrambled eggs...

58:11.979 --> 58:13.173
- Scrambled eggs.
...and...

58:13.280 --> 58:14.542
With a glass of milk.

58:14.648 --> 58:15.672
And a glass of milk.

58:15.783 --> 58:18.809
- Can I get a Harvey Wallbanger, please?
- Certainly, sir.

58:23.324 --> 58:26.816
You know, statistically, you're a lot
more likely to die riding on a train

58:26.927 --> 58:28.758
than any other form of transportation.

58:31.332 --> 58:33.926
10.3 times more likely
than dying on a plane.

58:35.736 --> 58:36.703
Simon?

58:39.106 --> 58:40.073
Simon Feck?

58:40.608 --> 58:41.597
Yes.

58:43.177 --> 58:46.112
My name is June.
I'm a friend of Roy Miller's.

58:47.681 --> 58:49.410
Have you found him yet?
Have you seen him?

58:49.516 --> 58:50.915
No, not yet.

58:51.885 --> 58:54.115
- Don't you wanna answer that?
- Yeah.

58:54.722 --> 58:55.689
But I can't.

58:55.789 --> 58:57.347
I'm not supposed to.

58:57.658 --> 58:58.750
It might be Roy.

58:58.859 --> 59:03.262
Yeah, but he told me not to answer the
phone, because the signal can be tracked.

59:03.364 --> 59:05.161
That's right. Of course.

59:13.574 --> 59:16.270
Did Roy happen to tell you
about the plan here?

59:16.377 --> 59:18.538
Are we supposed to meet him here, or...

59:19.179 --> 59:20.703
What did you say that drink was?

59:20.814 --> 59:23.146
- A Harvey...
- It's a Harvey Wallbanger.

59:23.417 --> 59:25.180
Do you mind just
ordering me one of those?

59:25.285 --> 59:27.048
Because it looks great.

59:27.154 --> 59:29.179
I'll just be right back.
You just stay here for a second.

59:29.289 --> 59:30.950
I'll be right back.

59:31.425 --> 59:34.792
Something is wrong.
It's getting hotter, Roy.

59:34.895 --> 59:36.522
She didn't answer her phone.

59:36.630 --> 59:38.757
- I told her not to. That's...
- We just got here.

59:38.866 --> 59:41.164
- That's good news.
- I'm sure she'll turn up. Roy...

59:41.268 --> 59:44.101
- I left a note posted right there.
- We may have an issue here.

59:44.204 --> 59:47.537
- The temperature...
- She's hungry... She's hungry.

59:47.641 --> 59:50.269
It's getting too hot.
We need to cool it down.

59:50.377 --> 59:52.311
Yeah, she went to get something to eat.

59:52.413 --> 59:54.074
Good. Come on, Simon.

01:00:19.873 --> 01:00:22.205
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:23.401
I'm feeling a little bit train-sick.

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:24.977
Is it okay if I hang out here for a while?

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:27.673
Of course, I will get you some water.

01:00:29.817 --> 01:00:30.784
Here you go.

01:00:39.393 --> 01:00:41.623
Antonio Quintana wants to know

01:00:41.729 --> 01:00:43.663
where is the battery?

01:00:53.173 --> 01:00:54.868
Where is the battery?

01:01:08.322 --> 01:01:11.189
I'm sorry, I'm looking for ice.

01:01:11.658 --> 01:01:12.647
- Roy.
- Bernhard.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.727
Miller.

01:01:13.827 --> 01:01:16.455
- Wrong room.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:01:16.563 --> 01:01:18.463
- You know him?
- Yeah.

01:01:18.565 --> 01:01:22.626
He's an assassin, platinum grade.
He's come to collect Simon.

01:01:22.736 --> 01:01:23.725
Oh, my God.

01:01:23.837 --> 01:01:26.101
- And to kill you.
- That's Simon?

01:01:26.206 --> 01:01:28.299
- Yeah, June, Simon. Simon, June.
- Hi.

01:01:33.313 --> 01:01:35.804
Jeez! I'm okay. I got this.

01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:46.258
Simon, please move.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.909
<i>You have quite some balls, Fräulein.</i>

01:02:04.244 --> 01:02:05.905
Hands like Houdini.

01:02:14.555 --> 01:02:15.988
I'm so sorry.

01:02:18.592 --> 01:02:20.856
But you were trying to kill me.

01:02:33.407 --> 01:02:34.806
That's disgusting.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.541
Oh, my God. Just die!

01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:49.856
Oh, shit.

01:02:51.558 --> 01:02:54.493
I got to get you guys someplace safe.

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:06.170
- They're not on the train.
- Oh, really?

01:03:06.273 --> 01:03:08.002
Cameras at the last station show nothing.

01:03:08.108 --> 01:03:10.235
They must have gotten off
between stops.

01:03:10.344 --> 01:03:12.107
Locals haven't found anything.

01:03:43.076 --> 01:03:45.044
Always the classics, Roy.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.856
Salzburg, Austria. Very nice.

01:04:15.142 --> 01:04:16.268
Yes.

01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:21.644
No, we just got in.

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:26.177
Well, we're talking now. No, I understand.

01:04:26.453 --> 01:04:28.478
Well, it's good to hear your voice,
too, Naomi.

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:31.580
I'll meet you at the caprice.
As soon as you can be there.

01:04:40.634 --> 01:04:42.693
It's a beautiful city, huh?

01:04:43.503 --> 01:04:44.561
Yeah.

01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:48.306
Never seen anything quite like it.

01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:55.805
Neither have I.

01:04:59.052 --> 01:05:00.679
I got to go out for a bit.

01:05:02.689 --> 01:05:03.849
Okay.

01:05:04.124 --> 01:05:07.184
I was thinking about ordering
some room service.

01:05:08.695 --> 01:05:12.256
And I thought maybe we could
have dinner or something.

01:05:12.466 --> 01:05:14.263
That sounds great.

01:05:15.502 --> 01:05:16.469
9:00?

01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:19.839
9:00 sounds great.

01:05:23.243 --> 01:05:24.267
June?

01:05:26.046 --> 01:05:30.540
Could you do me a favor
and just stick around here? It's better.

01:05:31.018 --> 01:05:34.476
Oh, yeah, of course.
Where else am I gonna go?

01:05:34.688 --> 01:05:36.246
See you in a bit.

01:05:40.894 --> 01:05:44.125
They're not gonna hurt you.
You're too valuable to them.

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:46.165
Now, just breathe, listen to your music.

01:05:46.266 --> 01:05:48.234
Here, as a matter of fact,
I got that for you.

01:05:49.703 --> 01:05:50.931
I know you like them.

01:05:51.038 --> 01:05:52.130
Cool, thanks.

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:56.801
Listen, order as much room service
as you like, but don't leave the room.

01:05:57.177 --> 01:05:58.371
Okay.

01:05:59.379 --> 01:06:02.246
- We need to talk about the Zephyr later.
- And we will.

01:07:29.636 --> 01:07:31.331
You seem different.

01:07:32.472 --> 01:07:33.496
Do I?

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.740
So, who's your companion?

01:07:39.679 --> 01:07:41.909
She's beautiful. The blonde.

01:07:42.516 --> 01:07:44.143
She seems capable.

01:07:45.218 --> 01:07:46.617
I just met her.

01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:49.518
She's a nobody.

01:07:49.723 --> 01:07:53.454
Just someone I picked up along the way.

01:07:54.361 --> 01:07:55.692
That's a shame.

01:07:57.497 --> 01:08:00.796
This is getting boring.
Are we gonna do a deal or not?

01:08:03.503 --> 01:08:05.630
Don't speak to me like that.

01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:10.674
I will speak to you any way I please, Tony.

01:08:10.877 --> 01:08:12.504
We both know you're lucky I'm here.

01:08:15.182 --> 01:08:18.082
I have the battery. I'm on a schedule.

01:08:18.618 --> 01:08:20.984
The world is full of bad guys
and people are calling.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.787
I understand.

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:30.826
What's your price?

01:08:32.532 --> 01:08:34.261
I have a figure in mind.

01:08:34.466 --> 01:08:36.332
What's it worth to you?

01:08:36.803 --> 01:08:39.670
Are you angry about your island, Roy?

01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:42.171
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.

01:08:55.354 --> 01:08:59.381
I'm Isabel George, Director
of Counter Espionage at the CIA.

01:09:00.327 --> 01:09:01.988
I'm sure you are.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.693
Forgive me, I just...

01:09:07.767 --> 01:09:10.031
I just don't know exactly what to believe.

01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:15.834
Well, that's understandable,
considering that the last five days

01:09:15.942 --> 01:09:19.139
you've been fed a steady diet
of misinformation and fantasy

01:09:19.246 --> 01:09:22.340
by an agent of ours
who's recently gone rogue.

01:09:22.682 --> 01:09:26.379
Well, he said that Fitzgerald was the
one that wanted to steal the battery.

01:09:26.486 --> 01:09:28.010
Well, let's examine the facts.

01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:32.885
Miller told you that he was protecting the
Zephyr from people wanting to misuse it.

01:09:33.093 --> 01:09:36.256
But now he's trying to sell it
to an international arms dealer.

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.287
Antonio Quintana.

01:09:38.765 --> 01:09:41.393
One of Europe's leading
weapons manufacturers.

01:09:42.368 --> 01:09:43.495
Ask yourself, Miss Havens,

01:09:46.372 --> 01:09:49.865
has Roy Miller said anything to you
that's proven to be true?

01:09:52.078 --> 01:09:54.171
<i>- God, excuse me.
- No, I'm sorry.</i>

01:09:58.885 --> 01:10:01.911
<i>Sorry, I was looking at my phone.
I hate it when people do that.</i>

01:10:04.424 --> 01:10:06.619
<i>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.</i>

01:10:08.094 --> 01:10:11.086
<i>- This is getting to be a habit.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

01:10:12.565 --> 01:10:16.558
He used you as a mule to carry the battery
through security, Miss Havens.

01:10:17.304 --> 01:10:19.135
He's been playing you.

01:10:19.939 --> 01:10:22.840
He's a spy, that's what he does.
He lies for a living.

01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:26.105
Any love, empathy,
we train that right out of them.

01:10:26.313 --> 01:10:27.780
What did you imagine?

01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:31.178
The two of you would move
into a condo together, get a dog?

01:10:31.384 --> 01:10:34.410
You can't have a life with him.
That's fantasy.

01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:36.713
But you can have yours back.

01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:38.387
She's been gone eight minutes.

01:10:38.591 --> 01:10:41.526
We need you to get back to the hotel
before Miller.

01:10:43.897 --> 01:10:46.866
- What am I supposed to do?
- All right, then.

01:10:49.436 --> 01:10:51.131
This pen is a transmitter.

01:10:51.671 --> 01:10:54.231
Once you have confirmation
that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr,

01:10:54.341 --> 01:10:57.435
that it's somewhere nearby,
or on his person,

01:10:58.278 --> 01:11:01.714
you can confirm this
by simply clicking the top button.

01:11:11.157 --> 01:11:12.886
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.955
Everything go okay?

01:11:18.832 --> 01:11:20.197
Well enough.

01:11:25.038 --> 01:11:26.164
It's getting hotter.

01:11:37.117 --> 01:11:38.982
So, did you get your price?

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.355
I followed you tonight.

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:51.757
You have nothing to say?

01:11:52.899 --> 01:11:55.299
Here's to Wichita

01:11:58.104 --> 01:11:59.298
where we first...

01:12:00.173 --> 01:12:02.038
Bumped into each other.

01:12:05.645 --> 01:12:07.579
Do you think that was fate, Roy?

01:12:09.416 --> 01:12:11.350
I don't believe in fate.

01:12:12.352 --> 01:12:14.183
But I believe in luck.

01:12:16.756 --> 01:12:18.917
I don't know what to believe.

01:12:30.837 --> 01:12:33.533
That hurt more than I thought it would.

01:12:38.278 --> 01:12:39.768
I'm going home.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:55.291
They promised that if you turned
yourself in, they'd protect you.

01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.393
I love your optimism.

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:01.825
Never lose it.

01:13:09.309 --> 01:13:10.674
Get her out of here.

01:13:26.926 --> 01:13:28.621
He's not here, sir.

01:13:29.162 --> 01:13:31.653
Did they tell you you're going home?

01:13:32.098 --> 01:13:34.396
You've seen the inside
of the honeycomb, June!

01:13:35.034 --> 01:13:36.296
You can't go home.

01:13:36.603 --> 01:13:38.662
<i>The suspect is on the roof.</i>

01:13:42.509 --> 01:13:43.498
Oh, shit.

01:14:02.362 --> 01:14:03.920
Director George!

01:14:04.464 --> 01:14:06.125
Get her in the car.

01:14:56.683 --> 01:14:58.241
He's heading toward the river.

01:15:12.332 --> 01:15:14.425
Stand down! He has the battery!

01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:25.040
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

01:15:25.244 --> 01:15:26.268
Hold your fire!

01:15:26.479 --> 01:15:27.537
Stand down!

01:15:27.747 --> 01:15:28.714
He has the battery!

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:49.294
Did you secure the kid?

01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:51.136
Yeah.

01:16:00.346 --> 01:16:01.472
Did they find Roy?

01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:04.441
We'll find the body. We have to.

01:16:04.817 --> 01:16:06.842
He went down with the Zephyr.

01:16:42.522 --> 01:16:43.682
Thank you, guys.

01:17:11.617 --> 01:17:12.879
Fitz?

01:17:12.985 --> 01:17:16.887
Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn.
Ramstein is that way, west.

01:17:16.989 --> 01:17:18.718
I think we're going south.

01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:20.722
You know what? You're right.

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:31.036
Tell him we're back on track.

01:17:31.237 --> 01:17:34.297
I don't have the battery,
but no one's gonna get it now.

01:17:34.507 --> 01:17:36.304
Yeah, I've got the next best thing.

01:17:36.576 --> 01:17:38.976
I'll see you in Spain in two days.

01:17:49.622 --> 01:17:50.919
Hey, Wilmer.

01:17:52.325 --> 01:17:54.122
- How was the party?
- It was nice.

01:17:54.594 --> 01:17:56.926
- I see the goat is still out there.
- Yeah.

01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:58.791
I thought it was a wedding present.

01:17:58.998 --> 01:18:00.795
It was, but,

01:18:02.869 --> 01:18:05.394
I think I wanted her to want it
more than she wanted it.

01:18:05.738 --> 01:18:06.727
Okay.

01:18:07.707 --> 01:18:11.404
<i>...Boston's classic rock station.
Here are the Kingsmen.</i>

01:18:11.611 --> 01:18:12.737
This just come in?

01:18:12.945 --> 01:18:15.675
G-body Grand Prix.
Longest hood in history.

01:18:16.616 --> 01:18:18.345
Gonna be a real beaut.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.687
Ru-pa... Fee-pa... No, it's...

01:18:31.297 --> 01:18:34.164
5826 Amapola.

01:18:36.836 --> 01:18:38.804
That's like an hour from here.

01:18:39.639 --> 01:18:41.436
Maybe it's a safe-house.

01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:17.806
Here we go.

01:20:10.927 --> 01:20:11.985
Shit!

01:20:14.997 --> 01:20:17.659
Who's out there?
I'm not afraid to use this.

01:20:17.767 --> 01:20:19.325
Oh, Frank, look at her!

01:20:19.602 --> 01:20:21.968
I want to know what she's doing
on my lawn in the middle of the night.

01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:23.763
I... I have the pistons you ordered.

01:20:23.973 --> 01:20:25.201
Pistons?

01:20:25.408 --> 01:20:26.898
For the '67 Grand Prix.

01:20:27.243 --> 01:20:28.835
Molly, I didn't...

01:20:29.479 --> 01:20:31.879
You are all wet. Please, come inside.

01:20:39.589 --> 01:20:42.387
That Pontiac you have out there, Frank,
is a real classic.

01:20:43.793 --> 01:20:46.455
I really love pre-'70s Grand Prixs.

01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:49.857
So, you two lived here long?

01:20:50.466 --> 01:20:54.027
This old place?
It's been our home for 40 years.

01:20:54.704 --> 01:20:56.934
Sit down, honey. Have a cookie.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.168
Frank thinks we should move,
but you know what? I am comfortable.

01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:04.811
And we can afford to stay,
thanks to Publishers Clearing House.

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:09.474
You won Publishers Clearing House?

01:21:09.585 --> 01:21:12.986
- Twice.
- Plus, we won two lotto quick picks

01:21:13.089 --> 01:21:15.580
- Frank doesn't even remember buying.
- Because I didn't buy them.

01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:18.717
Oh, yeah, like you didn't order pistons
off the Internet.

01:21:19.162 --> 01:21:22.825
You don't know what you're typing
into that computer, Frank.

01:21:23.132 --> 01:21:26.226
Another couple of minutes
on your clothes, honey.

01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:28.737
So,

01:21:31.107 --> 01:21:32.438
Roy Miller.

01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:36.440
This was one of his safe-houses,
wasn't it?

01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:41.514
What in the hell are you talking about?

01:21:43.886 --> 01:21:45.183
Honey, what's this all about?

01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:51.316
I'm sorry, I just thought, maybe...

01:21:51.527 --> 01:21:53.358
I must've had this all wrong.

01:21:53.729 --> 01:21:57.995
I was just looking for some information
about my friend, Roy.

01:21:59.769 --> 01:22:03.170
If you'd like to change,
there's a powder room right there.

01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:16.181
That's our son, Matthew.

01:22:16.385 --> 01:22:19.377
We lost him in Kuwait.
There was a chopper crash.

01:22:19.589 --> 01:22:22.717
He saved the lives
of two of his crewmen, and...

01:22:24.126 --> 01:22:25.753
He just always took care of everyone.

01:22:25.962 --> 01:22:27.486
He was an Eagle Scout.

01:22:27.597 --> 01:22:30.896
This was taken the day
he got that swimming badge.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.331
He could swim clear across Lake Sunapee

01:22:34.537 --> 01:22:36.596
with practically one breath.

01:22:38.975 --> 01:22:40.442
I just...

01:22:41.577 --> 01:22:43.943
I've been terribly rude.

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.343
I'm June Havens.

01:22:46.716 --> 01:22:48.149
Molly Knight.

01:22:49.118 --> 01:22:51.814
This is June Havens, and I'm leaving
a message on my own machine

01:22:51.921 --> 01:22:54.583
for whoever is listening to this phone call.

01:22:54.891 --> 01:22:56.518
I have the Zephyr.

01:22:56.993 --> 01:22:59.723
I have the Zephyr,
and I'm ready to make a deal.

01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:05.567
I'm sitting on Route 28,
right outside New Hampshire.

01:23:06.269 --> 01:23:07.964
And if you want the Zephyr,

01:23:08.237 --> 01:23:10.205
you better come and get it.

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:46.842
Hey, fellas.

01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:53.607
So,

01:23:54.183 --> 01:23:55.912
you want the Zephyr?

01:23:56.619 --> 01:23:58.985
I got the Zephyr. It's right here.

01:23:59.188 --> 01:24:00.553
Come and get it.

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:20.966
Come on. Let's go!

01:24:21.744 --> 01:24:22.836
<i>Welcome to España.</i>

01:24:34.123 --> 01:24:36.717
Today is the festival of San Fermin.

01:24:39.562 --> 01:24:42.429
Have you ever seen a bullfight,
Miss Havens?

01:24:48.671 --> 01:24:50.400
My name is Antonio Quintana.

01:24:51.474 --> 01:24:53.135
I know who you are.

01:24:55.444 --> 01:24:57.036
What did he give me?

01:24:57.947 --> 01:25:00.142
It's something we're developing
at my company.

01:25:00.249 --> 01:25:02.080
A new kind of truth serum.

01:25:02.418 --> 01:25:03.544
Really?

01:25:05.821 --> 01:25:08.415
I have a few questions for you
about the battery,

01:25:08.524 --> 01:25:11.857
since we both know
what you gave to my men was a joke.

01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:17.762
I don't like you very much.

01:25:20.036 --> 01:25:21.060
The truth!

01:25:23.739 --> 01:25:24.797
Good!

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:30.138
You know, I really like Miller, though.

01:25:30.346 --> 01:25:33.338
'Cause, you know, I was totally wrong
about him in Salzburg.

01:25:33.549 --> 01:25:36.074
He wanted me to hear that phone call
so that I would follow him.

01:25:36.185 --> 01:25:38.653
I'd turn him in,
and then he could get me home safely.

01:25:38.754 --> 01:25:40.085
He was trying to protect me.

01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:41.349
Shut up.

01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:45.786
It's crazy that I could feel
so powerful and capable around him...

01:25:45.895 --> 01:25:48.955
- Shut up.
...and yet he takes care of me.

01:25:49.165 --> 01:25:51.929
Shut up! Where is the battery?
Where is it?

01:25:53.469 --> 01:25:56.267
I bet you've never made a girl
an omelet, have you, Antonio?

01:25:59.642 --> 01:26:00.836
Don't test me, June.

01:26:01.043 --> 01:26:03.443
Or got her to her sister's wedding
on time.

01:26:03.546 --> 01:26:05.537
It's really the little things, honestly.

01:26:05.748 --> 01:26:07.739
- But they count so much.
- Enough!

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:09.274
Okay!

01:26:09.585 --> 01:26:12.053
Miller is dead!
Roy Miller is dead, he's out.

01:26:13.522 --> 01:26:14.580
No.

01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:18.053
No, he's not. He can hold his breath
for a really long time.

01:26:19.628 --> 01:26:20.686
He is dead!

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:02.394
I'm not gonna ask you again. But if
you don't tell me what I need to know,

01:27:03.806 --> 01:27:06.001
- you're gonna die!
- I don't know where the battery is.

01:27:06.108 --> 01:27:07.905
Then why did you tell everyone
you had it? Why?

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:09.978
Because I was trying to find Roy.

01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:17.885
Well, Antonio, whenever there's bad guys
like you around, Roy's not too far away.

01:27:22.057 --> 01:27:23.615
You're gonna die.

01:27:35.004 --> 01:27:36.198
Finally!

01:27:37.706 --> 01:27:40.140
Nice to meet you, John.

01:27:40.342 --> 01:27:41.366
Antonio.

01:27:41.877 --> 01:27:43.469
Too bad you couldn't get the battery.

01:27:46.048 --> 01:27:47.515
Where is the boy?

01:27:50.419 --> 01:27:52.853
You didn't think
I'd just bring the package, did you?

01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:54.486
Come on.

01:27:55.491 --> 01:27:58.085
Why don't you follow me down
to the river and bring the money?

01:27:58.194 --> 01:27:59.252
Okay.

01:28:32.561 --> 01:28:36.224
Is this thatching in here? Because I've
never seen anything like that before.

01:28:36.332 --> 01:28:39.995
We have really old architecture
in Boston, but nothing like this.

01:28:40.102 --> 01:28:42.332
You're really lucky, because this place is...

01:28:42.771 --> 01:28:45.934
Let me tell you.
You're really lucky, it's beautiful here.

01:28:46.575 --> 01:28:47.974
My thoughts are so clear.

01:28:49.345 --> 01:28:52.178
Is this all weapons money,
or is this family money?

01:28:53.882 --> 01:28:56.646
Gardens! He likes gardens, huh?

01:28:56.885 --> 01:28:58.819
Do you guys ever do any gardening?

01:28:58.921 --> 01:29:01.754
It's really relaxing.
It's amazing how much you can just...

01:29:01.857 --> 01:29:05.384
This really is a happy place.
Look at these trumpet flowers. They...

01:29:05.494 --> 01:29:07.257
Okay, Eduardo,
you don't have to pull me around.

01:29:07.363 --> 01:29:09.593
You can just tell me
where you want me to go, okay?

01:29:09.698 --> 01:29:12.462
- This way, blondie.
- See? Now we're communicating.

01:29:14.036 --> 01:29:16.436
I bet you're taking me someplace
safe and secure.

01:29:16.538 --> 01:29:18.529
Someplace special.
Antonio's special place.

01:29:18.674 --> 01:29:20.608
Antonio has a special place?
That's so nice.

01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:22.267
Everyone should have a special place.

01:29:31.687 --> 01:29:34.417
- Luis?
- Is there a problem, Eduardo?

01:29:40.996 --> 01:29:43.988
- Hi, Roy.
- Hi, June. You're supposed to be home.

01:29:44.099 --> 01:29:46.260
- You're supposed to be dead.
- I can explain.

01:29:46.368 --> 01:29:48.165
- You don't have to.
- I came here to get Simon.

01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:51.068
- I just, you know, caught up with him.
- That's cool.

01:29:56.312 --> 01:29:58.439
His name is Eduardo. Eduardo.

01:30:01.317 --> 01:30:03.012
I need you to listen,
because when you wake up,

01:30:03.118 --> 01:30:05.052
you're gonna call your boss
and you're gonna tell him

01:30:05.154 --> 01:30:08.180
that Roy Miller, that's me,
has the battery and escaped with the girl.

01:30:08.290 --> 01:30:09.848
- You have the battery?
- Yeah.

01:30:10.292 --> 01:30:12.852
You tell him I'm coming for him.

01:30:13.896 --> 01:30:14.885
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:30:15.964 --> 01:30:16.953
Let's go.

01:30:17.533 --> 01:30:20.400
I'm worried about Simon.
I haven't seen him.

01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:22.637
My tracker has been spotty.

01:30:22.738 --> 01:30:25.434
Life with you is so exciting.
You excite me, Miller.

01:30:25.541 --> 01:30:26.701
I took too long to get here.

01:30:26.809 --> 01:30:28.071
- 7:00.
- What?

01:30:28.177 --> 01:30:29.337
7:00.

01:30:38.287 --> 01:30:40.551
I think I feel like having sex.

01:30:42.591 --> 01:30:44.218
I think we'd have really great sex.

01:30:45.894 --> 01:30:46.861
Did they give you something?

01:30:48.797 --> 01:30:50.059
You should hydrate.

01:30:51.367 --> 01:30:52.356
Roy?

01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.664
Roy.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.847
Roy?

01:31:06.315 --> 01:31:07.373
June.

01:31:13.522 --> 01:31:14.489
June?

01:31:16.158 --> 01:31:17.955
You don't seem
very happy to see me, Roy.

01:31:20.596 --> 01:31:21.585
What?

01:31:22.398 --> 01:31:23.592
Not really.

01:31:43.185 --> 01:31:44.447
I am happy.

01:31:53.462 --> 01:31:55.430
- So the red dot is us?
- No, we're yellow.

01:31:55.531 --> 01:31:56.896
The red dot is Simon.

01:31:57.466 --> 01:32:00.094
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:16.015
- Air time.
- Air time?

01:32:35.304 --> 01:32:38.671
He says his name is Roy Miller.
He says he has the battery.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.938
Miller is here.

01:32:49.151 --> 01:32:50.345
There he is!

01:32:50.853 --> 01:32:52.184
There he is!

01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:55.452
This way. Follow me!

01:33:07.836 --> 01:33:08.860
Bulls?

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.149
- There's Fitz!
- I see him.

01:34:18.874 --> 01:34:20.671
- Take the guns.
- Okay.

01:34:22.244 --> 01:34:23.734
Here.

01:34:24.212 --> 01:34:26.373
- What next?
- Let them have it.

01:34:50.405 --> 01:34:53.135
June Havens, you've got skills.

01:34:55.577 --> 01:34:56.771
Let's go!

01:35:10.158 --> 01:35:11.147
Go.

01:35:35.617 --> 01:35:37.141
- See you down there.
- Are you sure?

01:35:37.252 --> 01:35:38.344
No.

01:35:43.225 --> 01:35:44.351
Sorry.

01:35:47.729 --> 01:35:49.253
- Get up.
- Okay.

01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.305
Freeze right there, Roy!

01:36:00.409 --> 01:36:01.433
Hey, Simon.

01:36:01.543 --> 01:36:02.942
Get down on your knees, now!

01:36:03.045 --> 01:36:04.535
- Roy!
- Now! Now!

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.411
Put them in the water. In the water.

01:36:07.582 --> 01:36:08.947
I just want the kid, Fitz.

01:36:10.686 --> 01:36:11.710
Okay.

01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.448
Well, I hope you brought what I want,
otherwise I'm gonna have to kill him.

01:36:14.556 --> 01:36:16.547
And I swear to you, I'll do it.

01:36:16.892 --> 01:36:19.725
I believe you. Just like Wichita.

01:36:20.095 --> 01:36:22.063
- I understand.
- Okay.

01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:23.561
I'm just gonna get the battery.

01:36:23.865 --> 01:36:25.492
- It's right here.
- Don't give it to him, Roy.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.067
Please don't give it to him. No, no.

01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:28.329
Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him.

01:36:29.705 --> 01:36:31.002
Put it on the deck.

01:36:31.106 --> 01:36:33.267
- Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him!
- Easy, easy.

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:34.467
Simon, it's okay.

01:36:34.576 --> 01:36:35.736
Roy, don't give it to him!

01:36:35.844 --> 01:36:38.574
- Shut it! Stop it! Shut it!
- Roy!

01:36:45.554 --> 01:36:47.749
Okay. Okay, I'll make another one.

01:36:47.856 --> 01:36:49.084
- You don't understand.
- Simon, don't talk.

01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:52.251
- I'll just make another one.
- Make another one?

01:37:09.811 --> 01:37:11.244
Am I dying?

01:37:12.547 --> 01:37:13.878
No, you fainted.

01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:17.511
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

01:37:17.619 --> 01:37:19.678
No, no. I've been trying to tell you...

01:37:24.493 --> 01:37:25.960
Why is it hot?

01:37:26.495 --> 01:37:28.690
Because it's filled with power.

01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:31.760
The battery... I messed up.
It's deteriorating.

01:37:31.867 --> 01:37:33.732
I know. It's unstable.

01:37:45.413 --> 01:37:48.940
You're a smart guy, Simon.
I know you'll figure it out.

01:37:53.822 --> 01:37:54.811
Oh, my glasses. Thank you.

01:37:56.525 --> 01:37:57.549
Roy,

01:37:57.659 --> 01:37:58.990
you're shot.

01:38:01.329 --> 01:38:02.591
Get help.

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:12.564
Roy.

01:38:18.013 --> 01:38:20.208
You're beautiful, June Havens.

01:38:32.427 --> 01:38:35.328
Stay with me. Roy, look at me.

01:38:36.598 --> 01:38:37.690
Stay with me.

01:38:41.136 --> 01:38:44.367
We're here now, Miller.
We got you. We got you.

01:38:47.142 --> 01:38:48.666
- Charge at 360.
- June.

01:38:48.777 --> 01:38:49.903
Clear!

01:39:14.903 --> 01:39:17.963
It's been a spectacular
couple of weeks, Miller.

01:39:20.775 --> 01:39:22.936
It's good to see you, Isabel.

01:39:25.914 --> 01:39:26.881
Hi, guys.

01:39:28.383 --> 01:39:30.214
You cleaned house, Roy.

01:39:31.853 --> 01:39:34.014
I have to thank you for that.

01:39:35.423 --> 01:39:37.288
I trusted the wrong man.

01:39:37.959 --> 01:39:39.290
It happens.

01:39:41.963 --> 01:39:45.194
Simon's happy. He's got a new lab.

01:39:47.235 --> 01:39:48.202
Where is June?

01:39:49.371 --> 01:39:50.929
I sent her home.

01:39:54.175 --> 01:39:55.472
She gets it.

01:39:57.279 --> 01:39:59.839
She knows you two lead different lives
and she's moving on.

01:40:00.348 --> 01:40:01.781
As should you.

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:06.885
You gave up those things.

01:40:06.988 --> 01:40:10.754
You let go of who you were.
Family, friends, that's the deal.

01:40:12.027 --> 01:40:13.824
Why are we still talking about this?

01:40:14.362 --> 01:40:16.353
Because the agency invested a lot in you.

01:40:16.665 --> 01:40:20.032
And you're an asset
only as long as you stay focused.

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:29.977
You look good.

01:40:31.513 --> 01:40:32.912
Get some rest.

01:40:33.014 --> 01:40:37.246
We got to transfer you to a secure facility
tomorrow. For your safety.

01:41:04.879 --> 01:41:07.541
Nurse? What... What did you give me?

01:41:09.517 --> 01:41:10.779
Brotine-zero.

01:41:23.665 --> 01:41:24.791
Stay under there, Roy.

01:41:26.267 --> 01:41:27.325
You're dead.

01:41:30.472 --> 01:41:31.996
Make way, please.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.198
Going to the mortuary.

01:41:39.748 --> 01:41:42.410
Don't worry, Roy. I got this.

01:41:43.518 --> 01:41:45.486
It's time for a vacation.

01:41:49.324 --> 01:41:50.655
<i>Ride like the wind</i>

01:41:53.328 --> 01:41:54.761
<i>And I've got</i>

01:41:56.531 --> 01:42:00.695
<i>Such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico</i>

01:42:44.813 --> 01:42:46.713
Hey, there, sleepy head.

01:42:49.484 --> 01:42:50.712
What day is it?

01:42:51.886 --> 01:42:53.080
Someday.

01:42:54.823 --> 01:42:56.256
Someday, Roy.

01:43:05.733 --> 01:43:07.360
What am I wearing?

01:43:09.904 --> 01:43:10.928
A pair of shorts.

01:43:13.041 --> 01:43:14.736
How did I get into shorts?

01:43:16.611 --> 01:43:19.239
Roy, I've been trained to rebuild
a six-speed transmission

01:43:19.347 --> 01:43:22.180
with nothing but a pair of pliers
and a crescent wrench.

01:43:23.118 --> 01:43:25.712
I think I can get you into a pair
of shorts without looking.

01:43:27.622 --> 01:43:29.419
I'm not saying that's what I did.

01:43:30.959 --> 01:43:32.984
You're both the navigator and the DJ.

01:43:33.094 --> 01:43:35.528
And we have a long way to go
to Cape Horn.

01:43:37.799 --> 01:43:41.098
With me, without me. With me,

01:43:43.037 --> 01:43:44.368
without me.

01:43:45.206 --> 01:43:46.230
With you.

01:43:46.341 --> 01:43:48.832
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.

01:43:49.777 --> 01:43:50.766
Yes, ma'am.

01:44:16.871 --> 01:44:18.168
Oh, my God, Frank.

01:44:18.273 --> 01:44:20.764
What is this envelope
with tickets to Cape Horn?

01:44:20.875 --> 01:44:21.933
What are you talking about?

01:44:22.043 --> 01:44:24.511
Did you order tickets to South America?

01:44:24.612 --> 01:44:26.978
Molly, I didn't order tickets to anywhere.

01:44:27.081 --> 01:44:29.572
You don't know what you're typing
on that computer, Frank.

01:44:29.684 --> 01:44:31.549
- Molly...
- Then, we must've won them!

01:44:31.653 --> 01:44:33.746
<i>- Molly...
- Well, we're going, aren't we?</i>
