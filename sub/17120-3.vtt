00:00.547 --> 00:02.755
I won't give up until
I find your daughter. Please.

00:02.787 --> 00:07.867
No! Sophie... I knew her parents
when she was taken.

00:08.492 --> 00:11.081
It was a tragedy
what happened to her mother.

00:11.292 --> 00:12.772
You must realise, Alice,

00:13.104 --> 00:16.064
you are the only one who can
help us find your friend.

00:16.995 --> 00:19.517
I studied Sophie Giroux
for years and years.

00:19.517 --> 00:22.077
There is a gesture she makes,
a nervous habit.

00:22.077 --> 00:24.058
This girl, Alice,
made the same gesture.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.498
And what? Alice's parents -
they just accept it?

00:27.498 --> 00:29.911
Sam? Does she seem...

00:30.762 --> 00:32.804
different to you?

00:34.656 --> 00:37.576
Was there a yellow van mentioned
in Alice's abduction?

00:37.842 --> 00:40.442
That was the only clue
we had in Sophie's case.

00:40.442 --> 00:42.678
I can't keep coming round.

00:42.677 --> 00:43.877
Then don't.

00:46.837 --> 00:49.597
I want to sleep in the shed.

00:49.597 --> 00:53.077
'And I need you to lock me in.'

00:53.077 --> 00:56.437
So... The man in the photo.

00:56.437 --> 00:57.517
Yes, that's him.

00:57.517 --> 00:58.717
HE STRUGGLES

00:58.717 --> 01:00.357
What the hell's going on, Sergeant?

♪ For you to come home. ♪

03:41.571 --> 03:44.331
We haven't yet talked about
the man who took you.

03:46.411 --> 03:47.971
We don't have to.

03:49.782 --> 03:54.080
But, seeing his picture,
knowing that he is locked up now...

03:55.131 --> 03:57.011
..I wonder how that makes you feel?

03:59.611 --> 04:03.856
Well, the truth - the honest truth -

04:03.881 --> 04:05.721
is that I feel sorry for him.

04:05.721 --> 04:08.972
In these circumstances,
it is normal to feel these things.

04:09.211 --> 04:12.211
For years, this man,
he has been your world.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.691
There is a bond...
There is no bond.

04:16.523 --> 04:17.887
There's nothing.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.052
You had a child with him.

04:22.074 --> 04:24.394
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:25.044 --> 04:26.821
I'm just trying to reassure you

04:26.821 --> 04:28.821
that whatever you're feeling,
it's normal.

04:30.261 --> 04:32.890
There are often moments
when he might not have been cruel,

04:32.890 --> 04:35.170
but instead shown you some kindness.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.800
When you are deprived of all else,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.689
this can feel very much
like love, even...

04:41.689 --> 04:44.923
Do you know, I don't think
I want to talk about him after all.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.529
Is that OK with you?

04:49.129 --> 04:50.329
Sure.

Mr Herz is with the police.
They say he abducted two girls.

You might as well know.
Everyone else will soon enough.

06:53.199 --> 06:55.599
Why would they say that about him?

06:55.599 --> 06:57.959
Just go home, Andreas.

07:00.678 --> 07:02.358
We carry on.

07:40.238 --> 07:43.198
Detective Baptiste.
Thank you for coming.

07:46.798 --> 07:48.398
Her session's almost over.

07:53.399 --> 07:57.119
Sorry to interrupt but Mr Baptiste's
here. Whenever you're ready.

07:57.119 --> 07:59.719
You upset her, you know?
Last time you were here.

08:01.599 --> 08:03.199
It was not my intention.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.079
Well, we only called you
because she asked us.

08:05.079 --> 08:08.719
And I don't know what she wants to
talk to you about, but you keep it
short. She needs rest.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.479
Of course.

08:27.719 --> 08:30.490
Well? I'm told you wish to see me?

08:32.799 --> 08:36.839
The last time you asked me
about Sophie...

08:38.078 --> 08:39.967
..but I wasn't honest.

08:40.719 --> 08:43.046
I guess I was ashamed to say.

08:43.879 --> 08:45.039
To say what?

08:50.009 --> 08:51.733
When I left...

08:52.759 --> 08:55.639
Sophie, he hadn't fed her for weeks.

08:55.639 --> 08:59.447
Her eyesight was going...
she couldn't stand.

09:00.839 --> 09:02.876
I sneaked her food when I could,

09:02.901 --> 09:06.501
but without me there
to try and look after her...

09:09.448 --> 09:11.589
I left her to die.

09:15.728 --> 09:19.248
Well...you did what you had to.

09:23.008 --> 09:24.648
I wonder...

09:25.848 --> 09:28.768
..perhaps you know
some story of Sophie,

09:28.768 --> 09:32.928
about a time when...
she was not afraid.

09:32.928 --> 09:35.398
Something I can tell her father.

09:35.888 --> 09:39.222
Something that will bring her
to life in his mind...

09:39.688 --> 09:42.288
when she was not scared and alone.

09:46.301 --> 09:48.131
I can't think of anything.

09:51.019 --> 09:52.219
Really?

09:55.568 --> 09:57.109
There is nothing?

10:00.056 --> 10:02.852
I'm sorry, I don't know what
it is that you want me to say.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.412
---

10:14.169 --> 10:16.002
---

10:19.132 --> 10:21.332
Dad, I don't know what...
What's going on?

10:24.052 --> 10:26.052
Sorry to have troubled you.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.900
---

10:37.925 --> 10:39.005
Hey, that's it,

10:39.005 --> 10:40.325
all right? On your way.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.583
Hey. Get out.

10:45.618 --> 10:46.760
Out!

10:47.976 --> 10:49.856
I want you out of my house now!

10:49.856 --> 10:52.826
- Sam, Sam! Come on.
- I'm going to check on my daughter.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.226
When I come down,
I want you out of this house.

11:05.566 --> 11:06.802
I'm sorry.

11:09.112 --> 11:11.212
I see how you look at Alice.

11:11.831 --> 11:13.937
You know she is different,
don't you?

11:16.470 --> 11:17.653
I don't know what you mean.

11:17.653 --> 11:20.293
Have you considered a DNA test?

11:21.292 --> 11:24.092
- Why would we...
- You are her mother.

11:25.033 --> 11:27.172
You would feel it more than anyone.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.860
RINGING TONE

11:43.852 --> 11:46.212
PHONE VIBRATES

11:48.942 --> 11:49.838
Hi.

11:49.838 --> 11:51.798
'Where are you?'
Why?

11:53.215 --> 11:55.255
I'm just asking, Matthew.

11:56.957 --> 11:59.697
I'm worried about you.
I feel like we don't talk any more.

11:59.866 --> 12:04.523
'You out with those friends of your
friends again? Those Adler twins...'

12:04.524 --> 12:07.568
I think I'm a bit old for you
to be choosing my friends, Mum.

12:08.763 --> 12:11.295
---

12:11.319 --> 12:14.165
---

12:33.604 --> 12:36.284
- Shit.
- What is it?

12:36.284 --> 12:39.324
My dad's nurse never made it in.

12:39.324 --> 12:42.684
I've had my bloody phone off,
missed all her messages.

12:42.963 --> 12:46.483
He's been on his own all morning.

12:51.639 --> 12:53.023
Eve. Eve!

12:53.595 --> 12:56.571
- Let me come with you.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.995
You know, it's not like anybody
misses me at work, is it?

13:00.583 --> 13:02.955
That's not what this is, OK?

13:56.050 --> 13:58.410
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

14:00.276 --> 14:01.876

14:12.731 --> 14:13.971
Where are we?

14:13.972 --> 14:17.012
If I had to guess,
I'd say Al Mazraa.

14:18.092 --> 14:21.292
- They've taken us to the front line.
- Jesus.

14:21.292 --> 14:24.012
Whatever they know about
your guy, Daniel Reed,

14:24.012 --> 14:27.354
let's find out what it is
and get out of here.

14:27.535 --> 14:29.207
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

14:35.227 --> 14:36.299
What's that?

14:36.949 --> 14:38.391
My good luck charm.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.456
Does it work?

14:41.390 --> 14:43.851
The - what do you say...?

14:44.498 --> 14:46.418
The jury's out.

14:54.431 --> 14:55.733
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

14:56.418 --> 14:58.243
Daniel Reed.

15:01.938 --> 15:04.338
Who the hell are you
and why are you looking for me?

15:12.498 --> 15:13.785
Daniel.

15:15.338 --> 15:16.333
Daniel!

15:17.498 --> 15:18.486
Hey.

15:19.067 --> 15:21.387
I haven't heard from you in days.

15:21.752 --> 15:23.632
- I'm worried.
- I'm fine.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.796
You do not look like you're fine.

15:27.832 --> 15:29.712
I called you this morning.

15:30.654 --> 15:32.814
What happened? Tell me.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.447
I've been going through
Dad's financial records

15:38.447 --> 15:40.287
and I found...something.

15:40.848 --> 15:42.222
What do you mean?

15:42.222 --> 15:43.862
You know, I thought I knew my dad.

15:45.223 --> 15:48.260
Henry Reed, everyone's mate.

15:48.623 --> 15:52.570
Never going to surprise you,
but...a decent guy, you know?

15:52.946 --> 15:56.293
Always there when you need him,
always ready to do the right thing.

15:56.729 --> 15:57.840
And then, out of the blue,

15:57.865 --> 15:59.915
he sticks a gun in his mouth
and checks out. Why?

16:00.047 --> 16:02.127
- Why would he do that?
- Daniel...

16:03.847 --> 16:05.501
And the Army don't give a shit.

16:05.911 --> 16:08.445
No, as far as they're concerned,
it's case closed.

16:08.470 --> 16:11.350
I asked them -
give me one good reason.

16:13.270 --> 16:16.150
But it's back in line.
Don't ask questions.

16:16.624 --> 16:18.555
Clean your weapon,
stand up straight,

16:18.555 --> 16:21.361
keep those boots shiny.
Be a soldier.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.158
Don't!

16:28.354 --> 16:31.074
Stop trying to keep me in this box.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.634
Stop trying to make me feel
and mourn

16:32.634 --> 16:35.170
like there's some condition
that needs to be treated.

16:38.514 --> 16:39.994
Please don't be like this.

16:42.354 --> 16:44.074
I don't know any more.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.874
She won't come out of her room now.

16:55.874 --> 16:58.194
I mean, what the hell...
What was he saying to her?

16:59.954 --> 17:01.639
He called her Sophie.

17:02.330 --> 17:04.530
He asked her why she was lying.

17:04.530 --> 17:06.450
... idiot.

17:07.749 --> 17:11.909
Sophie. That other case
he talked about. That other girl.

17:16.624 --> 17:18.704
When I...look at her,

17:18.729 --> 17:22.651
when I...talk to her,
when I touch her...

17:25.409 --> 17:27.059
..all I can think...

17:29.409 --> 17:32.734
..is I...
I don't feel it.

17:37.449 --> 17:40.569
- I don't feel like it's her.
- Don't say that.

17:42.849 --> 17:45.249
That detective
asked about a DNA test.

17:45.249 --> 17:47.725
Oh, Jesus.
Are you listening to yourself?

17:48.428 --> 17:49.963
The way she sounds,
everything she remembers...

17:49.963 --> 17:51.883
You think I don't know
my own daughter?

17:51.883 --> 17:55.444
I want her back too, Sam, but you're
seeing what you want to see!

17:55.445 --> 17:57.205
There is something wrong with her!
STOP IT!

17:57.205 --> 18:01.663
After everything she's been through!
How can you?

18:17.508 --> 18:18.696
Alice?

18:22.230 --> 18:23.550
Open up, love.

18:27.498 --> 18:29.298
Come on, he's gone now.

18:30.783 --> 18:33.183
You're safe.
I promise he won't be back.

18:35.102 --> 18:37.117
All right, I'm going to come in.

19:00.708 --> 19:01.748
Sam?

19:04.255 --> 19:05.066
What is it?

19:05.216 --> 19:07.736
Sam, what's the matter?
What's happened?

19:07.736 --> 19:09.896
She's gone. Climbed out the window.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.496
Call the police.

19:11.496 --> 19:14.595
Alice! Alice!

19:30.804 --> 19:33.044
ALARM BEEPS

19:38.192 --> 19:39.890
KNOCK AT DOOR

19:41.931 --> 19:43.123
Please.

20:01.606 --> 20:05.024
You have a suspect in custody.
I wish to speak with him.

20:05.966 --> 20:11.006
I asked already the German police
but they refused. I was hoping...

20:11.006 --> 20:14.836
Mr Baptiste, the Military Police
are working on this case

20:14.861 --> 20:16.965
with the German Polizei.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.165
With respect,
you have no jurisdiction...

20:19.165 --> 20:20.685
I know. But 12 years ago,

20:20.685 --> 20:22.965
I promised the parents
of a little girl

20:22.965 --> 20:25.925
I would find out what happened
to their daughter.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.780
Now, I may have a chance
of delivering on that promise.

20:29.805 --> 20:32.103
So, jurisdiction,

20:32.128 --> 20:33.106
you understand,

20:33.107 --> 20:35.627
is no more than a word to me.

20:35.627 --> 20:38.067
Your disregard for it is immaterial.

20:39.507 --> 20:42.368
I have experience in this field,
would you agree?

20:42.593 --> 20:46.227
All I want is an opportunity
to speak with the suspect.

20:46.227 --> 20:50.065
What do you intend to ask
that hasn't already been put to him?

20:50.065 --> 20:52.305
It's not the question
that matters, Brigadier.

20:52.305 --> 20:54.865
Observing how it is
answered is the key.

I've been a detective

20:58.235 --> 21:00.410
and the girl who calls
herself Alice...

21:01.244 --> 21:03.364
..she is not telling us something.

21:03.623 --> 21:04.983
Such as?

21:07.983 --> 21:12.303
Your daughter tells me a DNA test
hasn't been performed yet.

21:13.983 --> 21:16.646
Alice's parents
haven't requested one.

21:17.063 --> 21:19.704
You don't think a parent
knows their own child?

21:23.951 --> 21:25.449
It has happened before.

21:25.449 --> 21:28.209
All I want is the certainty
that science offers.

21:31.409 --> 21:34.930
I've been polite...Mr Baptiste,

21:34.955 --> 21:38.603
but I'm afraid some of us
still have jobs to do.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.248
You're retired.

21:41.025 --> 21:42.287

Oh!

22:03.533 --> 22:04.733
Excuse me.

22:05.973 --> 22:07.413
It's all right.

22:11.714 --> 22:13.510
I'm here to see the Brigadier?

22:13.510 --> 22:14.870
Trooper Reed.

22:19.144 --> 22:22.271
Look, she's been gone
for over an hour.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.951
You need to be taking this
a lot more seriously.

22:24.951 --> 22:27.191
Just find her, all right?
Do your job.

22:28.039 --> 22:31.631
Nothing. They've got cars out,
but...she could be anywhere.

22:31.986 --> 22:35.426
She shouldn't be even out there
on her own. Not in her state.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.089
Why would she run away?

22:38.735 --> 22:40.175
I don't understand.

22:42.126 --> 22:43.260
Why do you think?

22:44.310 --> 22:46.150
She heard us arguing.
She heard you saying

22:46.150 --> 22:47.293
there was something wrong with her.

22:47.479 --> 22:49.585
She heard you and she wanted
to get the hell out of here

22:49.585 --> 22:50.815
and who can blame her?

22:52.185 --> 22:54.293
Christ, Gemma, we had her home!

22:55.865 --> 22:57.365
Where she belongs.

22:57.465 --> 22:59.999
And if anything happens to her,
this is on you.

23:00.665 --> 23:02.025

Alice Webster, identified your
husband as the man who abducted her.

24:01.745 --> 24:04.465
People ask sometimes if it was hard,

24:04.943 --> 24:07.130
deciding to make my life here.

24:07.463 --> 24:10.290
Kristian - his family, friends -

24:10.315 --> 24:11.165
they welcomed me.

24:11.794 --> 24:14.048
I became one of the locals
down the road.

24:14.591 --> 24:16.799
One of the "village idiots"...

24:17.575 --> 24:20.135

call them on the base.

24:21.655 --> 24:25.116
And you're saying,
this whole time...

24:25.141 --> 24:28.781
he was living some kind of double
life and I didn't even notice?

24:30.773 --> 24:34.941
Alice says she was moved several
times during her...imprisonment.

24:35.929 --> 24:37.689
Did your husband travel much?

24:39.217 --> 24:40.799
We liked it here.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.463
I travelled enough in the Army.

24:44.176 --> 24:45.621
On his own, then?

24:45.736 --> 24:49.176
The German police tell me your
husband's a keen bird-watcher.

24:49.176 --> 24:51.354
Does he take many trips?
Weekends away?

24:51.379 --> 24:52.173
Some.

24:52.619 --> 24:53.939
So, what?

24:55.016 --> 24:58.883
Does he own any property?
A storage unit, even?

24:59.892 --> 25:02.452
Because to do what he's been
doing, all these years,

25:02.452 --> 25:04.052
you must have noticed things?

25:04.052 --> 25:05.492
Do I need a lawyer, Sergeant?

25:06.310 --> 25:09.729
Because this is starting
to feel like an interrogation.

I can't put you back on regular duty

29:44.719 --> 29:46.879

29:51.719 --> 29:55.539
I see you requested to be posted

29:56.479 --> 29:59.119
I changed my mind -
or, we changed our minds.

30:00.159 --> 30:03.160
I heard there are training positions
opening up in Aldershot.

30:04.405 --> 30:07.243
If I write a recommendation,
I can make it happen.

30:08.405 --> 30:10.010
Why not make the leap now?

30:10.965 --> 30:12.566
We could go home?

30:16.885 --> 30:19.965

Let me know.

30:23.205 --> 30:24.685
Thanks.

30:26.965 --> 30:28.685
I went to the prison.

30:28.685 --> 30:30.285
I chickened out.

30:30.285 --> 30:31.365

30:31.631 --> 30:33.311
I really thought I could do it.

30:34.325 --> 30:37.125
I promised Alice, you know?
I made her a promise.

30:37.125 --> 30:39.970
So, why can't I?
Why can't I just go through with it?

Funny, Matty, he was a funny guy.

30:55.275 --> 30:57.115
But you say the wrong thing...

30:57.115 --> 30:58.275
POW!

30:59.261 --> 31:00.941
Mama kept forgiving him, of course.

31:00.941 --> 31:02.501
"Not his fault," she would say.

31:02.501 --> 31:04.501
"He is under a lot of stress."

31:04.501 --> 31:07.261
One day, she went down
a flight of stairs.

31:07.261 --> 31:08.941
Now, she has brain damage.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.901
Has to be changed like a baby.

31:13.021 --> 31:14.901
Forgiveness is weakness.

31:16.869 --> 31:19.244
I know. I know.

31:21.652 --> 31:23.000
But she's my sister.

31:23.323 --> 31:24.603
And I owe her.

31:26.794 --> 31:28.434
I'm desperate here.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.850
I'll pay double...

31:30.262 --> 31:33.142
They don't have to be an experienced

31:34.185 --> 31:35.425

31:48.958 --> 31:49.767

You're going to stay at mine for a

31:53.158 --> 31:56.358
and I'll try and find someone
to help look after you. Hm...

31:58.371 --> 31:59.971
You're a lovely girl.

32:01.651 --> 32:03.652
I knew a girl like you.

32:05.112 --> 32:06.672

32:08.995 --> 32:10.755

didn't take his own life.

32:56.784 --> 32:58.944
I've been down this road, mate.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.545

33:00.802 --> 33:03.011
I drove myself crazy over it,

33:03.150 --> 33:05.028
wondering why someone
as happy as him

33:05.028 --> 33:07.170
could just stick a gun
in his mouth one day.

33:07.169 --> 33:09.165
I came here to find answers.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.764
I found out my dad
was transferring money -

33:12.789 --> 33:16.892
regularly, for years - to a man
called Mirza Barzani, up in Erbil.

33:17.909 --> 33:21.619
And when I found out why,
it made me sick...to my guts.

33:21.619 --> 33:23.579

Sam!

38:24.600 --> 38:25.880
SAM!

38:29.080 --> 38:30.680
You've been gone for hours.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.536
Where have you been?

38:33.777 --> 38:35.697
I just needed to get out.

38:36.408 --> 38:39.088
Where did you go?
We've been going out of our mind...!

38:39.671 --> 38:42.031
- I just had to get out.
- Yeah, but you can't...

38:42.688 --> 38:45.597
After what happened...
You've got to understand,

38:45.622 --> 38:47.845
we've been trying to give you space,
but you can't just...

38:48.312 --> 38:49.832
You can't ask us not to worry.

38:50.196 --> 38:51.436
I mean, that's...

38:51.436 --> 38:52.796
That's not fair.

38:56.356 --> 38:57.987
(This is not my life.)

38:58.573 --> 39:00.091
(This is not my life.)

39:01.453 --> 39:02.733
Don't say that.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.780

I thought maybe we could go
to the Christmas market tomorrow?

40:57.443 --> 41:00.123
You know, if you felt up for it.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

41:01.930 --> 41:05.290
And then, afterwards, maybe we could
get a full English at Magda's.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.002
Sounds good, Dad.

41:09.942 --> 41:12.439

try the liver sausage again.

41:16.582 --> 41:17.942

41:21.142 --> 41:23.342
Maybe after, we could
get a glass of Gluhwein.

41:23.342 --> 41:26.022
They do that well over here,
don't they?

41:30.142 --> 41:31.222
What?

41:32.862 --> 41:33.993
It's just that...

41:34.882 --> 41:36.722
the last time that I had that...

41:38.803 --> 41:41.083
..I'd just been on
the highest roller-coaster

41:41.083 --> 41:42.483
that I've ever been on.

41:43.683 --> 41:45.443
It was this big, wooden one...

41:46.583 --> 41:50.229
And at the top, it was
such a clear summer's day,

41:50.483 --> 41:51.864
I could see for miles.

41:51.864 --> 41:55.539
It was so high...
I could see the autobahn.

41:57.703 --> 41:59.583
I screamed the whole way down.

42:00.903 --> 42:03.371
Felt like all the air
had been sucked out of me,

42:03.371 --> 42:05.728
like I would never breathe again.

42:07.330 --> 42:10.453
And I felt sick...and terrified.

42:14.009 --> 42:17.026
But the moment it stopped, I just
wanted to do it all over again.

42:19.049 --> 42:21.777
But, instead, we sat, and...

42:22.569 --> 42:24.009
..we had Gluhwein.

42:26.049 --> 42:27.609
It was a good day.

42:33.649 --> 42:35.769
- What are you talking about?
- Just leave it.

42:37.969 --> 42:39.887
You never did that with us.

42:41.123 --> 42:43.563
We never went on a roller-coaster
here in Germany.

42:43.564 --> 42:45.364
Just leave it, will you?

42:49.724 --> 42:52.844
You're talking about something
you did with...with him?

42:54.244 --> 42:56.964
- With the man who took you, aren't you?
- Yeah.

43:00.324 --> 43:03.364
- How the hell can you sit there...
- You know, sometimes...

43:04.724 --> 43:07.164
..in the last few years,
he'd let us out.

43:08.334 --> 43:12.682
He said, if we tried to talk
to anyone, or if we tried to run,

43:12.707 --> 43:13.907
that he'd hurt us.

43:15.036 --> 43:16.396
And we believed him.

43:17.963 --> 43:22.083
We were just so...
grateful to be outside.

43:25.267 --> 43:26.587
And, yeah...

43:27.354 --> 43:29.354
..there were times we were happy.

43:31.667 --> 43:34.797
- You should know that.
- No, you don't mean that.

43:34.797 --> 43:37.197
- You can't mean that.
- Well, we don't know what it was like...

43:39.237 --> 43:41.077
You're talking about...

43:42.114 --> 43:43.881
..the man who took you...

43:44.511 --> 43:46.954
..the man who attacked you,

43:46.979 --> 43:50.552
- the man who held you prisoner...
- Stop it...

43:50.552 --> 43:53.072
..and yet, you're talking about it
like it's some happy memory.

43:54.906 --> 43:56.461
Well, it isn't!

43:58.721 --> 44:01.515
That man poisoned your mind,

44:01.540 --> 44:04.140
and you have got to be able
to see that!

44:16.220 --> 44:19.300
Life isn't as simple as
you want to make it, Gemma.

44:21.420 --> 44:24.300
There were times
that I was happy with him, OK?

44:26.980 --> 44:28.420
I had a baby.

44:32.217 --> 44:36.660
And she made my life worth living,
no matter where I was.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.740
And then, she died.

44:49.260 --> 44:50.491
So, what, now,

44:50.763 --> 44:52.563
I'm supposed to be "free"?

44:55.162 --> 44:56.276
Am I?

44:59.779 --> 45:01.619
I don't feel free.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.480
I don't feel anything.

make me do this again.

52:56.233 --> 52:58.046

and I don't know why,
but I owe it to her.

53:03.431 --> 53:04.936
She made me promise...

53:05.715 --> 53:07.663
..to tell you that she's sorry.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.905
She told you that?

54:29.221 --> 54:29.941
What?

We only stayed for her.

54:47.503 --> 54:49.263
Don't even know what I'm doing here.

54:52.921 --> 54:54.681

I called Jorn Lenhart -
you know, Detective Lenhart?

57:11.184 --> 57:13.184
And I couldn't get hold of him.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.960
I needed to talk to someone.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.122
I'm sorry,
I didn't know where else to go.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.944
I found something.

57:29.720 --> 57:33.200
When Alice came back, she told us
that she went on a roller-coaster,

57:33.200 --> 57:34.600
with Kristian Herz.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.669
She was taken outside...?

57:36.669 --> 57:37.978
But I didn't think anything of it.

57:37.978 --> 57:41.338
It was just a story. But it turned
out it was one of those...

57:41.338 --> 57:43.818
you know, when you get to the top,
and it takes your picture?

57:43.818 --> 57:46.538
Well, Julien Baptiste
had the idea of asking Jorn

57:46.538 --> 57:48.978
to get hold of the hard drive
from the theme park.

57:48.978 --> 57:51.698

58:00.413 --> 58:03.773
I thought maybe it was just giving
me something to do.

58:04.419 --> 58:06.258
But, then today...

58:08.754 --> 58:09.833
That's Alice.

58:10.435 --> 58:11.675
No.

58:13.019 --> 58:15.019
