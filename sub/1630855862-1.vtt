14:18.457 --> 14:20.526
That's my brother
you're talking about.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.563
[voices whispering]

14:29.301 --> 14:31.470
[buzzing]

14:31.470 --> 14:35.307
[voices whispering]

14:36.141 --> 14:37.376
What's that?

14:41.780 --> 14:43.048
Manny?

15:19.718 --> 15:22.521
[Manny] What the fuck?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.457
I'm too high.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.429
Manny!

15:32.331 --> 15:33.499
Ow.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.672
[groans] What the--
Holy shit.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.641
Oh, my God. Donna.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.009
Do--
[shouts]

15:53.519 --> 15:55.254
There's something
wrong with him.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.157
Just get him home.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.730
[growling, sniffing]

16:31.724 --> 16:34.226
[flies buzzing]

16:38.997 --> 16:40.232
Timmy!

16:42.568 --> 16:43.869
[flies buzzing]

16:43.869 --> 16:45.537
[wheezing]

16:47.906 --> 16:49.174
Where'd he go?

16:50.275 --> 16:51.510
Where's the dog?

16:52.811 --> 16:56.281
Hendrix. Boy, come here.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.583
Just get him
back to the porch.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.385
Get out of here
as quick as we can, okay?

16:59.385 --> 17:03.021
[door slams]
Hey. Jud Crandall.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.424
Timmy.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.562
Listen, we saw your do--
Yeah.

17:10.562 --> 17:12.431
I heard that you were
trying to join the Peace Corps.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.300
Yeah. We're actually
on our way out now.
[Timmy] Yeah.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.402
Hey.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.606
You think you would have lasted
one day in real combat?

17:22.441 --> 17:26.478
Because I think that
you'd piss yourself so bad

17:26.478 --> 17:28.981
that you'd
set off a minefield.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.449
And that you're lucky

17:30.449 --> 17:32.818
that old Dan Crandall
paid off that doc

17:32.818 --> 17:33.986
to keep you out the war.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.622
Yeah. Yeah.

17:36.622 --> 17:37.823
No war for Jud.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.459
There's no war
for Jud Crandall.

17:40.459 --> 17:41.827
I think that's a lie, Timmy.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.562
[Timmy]
I'm lying? Look at me. Yeah.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.766
Well, only children
tell the whole truth,
but I'm not lying.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.268
I'm not.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.474
[Jud] Okay.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.443
Really glad you're back
in one piece, Timmy,

17:57.443 --> 17:59.178
and it was really good
to see you.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.719
I think
we're gonna be going now.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.321
You take care of yourself.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.823
[screams]
[Jud] Hey! Hey!

18:10.823 --> 18:11.924
Norma! Norma!

18:11.924 --> 18:14.393
[snarling]
Timmy, get your dog!

18:14.960 --> 18:16.528
[grunts]
[screams]

18:16.528 --> 18:17.996
Timmy!

18:17.996 --> 18:19.865
[snarling continues]

18:19.865 --> 18:21.500
Call your dog!

18:21.500 --> 18:22.568
[snarling]

18:22.568 --> 18:23.836
No!

18:28.273 --> 18:29.875
[Hendrix panting]

18:29.875 --> 18:32.511
Norma? Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

18:33.111 --> 18:34.480
It's okay. It's okay.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.518
Fuck! Hold on. Hold on.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.556
What the fuck?

18:44.556 --> 18:47.125
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.627
It's okay. That's it.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.229
We're gonna go to
the hospital, okay?

18:50.229 --> 18:51.530
Come here, put your head up.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.232
It's okay. It's okay.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.368
It's okay. It's okay.
Look at me.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.140
Okay?

19:14.453 --> 19:17.456
[screaming]
Norma! Norma!

19:17.456 --> 19:19.625
[snarling]
Timmy, get your dog!

19:24.997 --> 19:26.532
Hey. Hi.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.233
Hi.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.636
[groans]
Stay down.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.904
How you feeling?

19:33.071 --> 19:35.440
I am sore. Yeah.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.876
Doctor said this could've
been a lot worse.

19:38.777 --> 19:41.179
But he wants to keep you here
for a few nights.

19:41.179 --> 19:45.317
Okay.
Then we'll get to Michigan.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.386
Then the world.

19:50.222 --> 19:53.425
Jud, this wasn't your fault.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.867
I'm gonna let you rest. Okay.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.571
I'll be back tomorrow.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.546
[muttering]

20:18.350 --> 20:20.385
Sorry.
Fucking hey, man.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.956
What happened to your hand?

20:25.023 --> 20:26.792
Bird-watching incident.

20:27.759 --> 20:28.794
Hey, uh, Manny.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.497
Can we go somewhere
and-- and talk?

20:33.198 --> 20:35.867
What,
you trying to ask me out?

20:35.867 --> 20:37.269
Come on, out with it.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.808
You're avoiding me.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.614
I'm just--
I'm just trying to...

20:49.881 --> 20:51.316
What, say goodbye?

20:51.316 --> 20:53.685
[scoffs] Is that it?

20:53.685 --> 20:55.354
What's the point? Bye.

20:55.354 --> 20:56.922
All right,
have fun with Norma.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.363
Well, actually,
we're not going yet.

21:05.697 --> 21:10.202
Norma got attacked
by Timmy's dog.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.738
Shit. Is she okay?

21:12.738 --> 21:13.939
Mm-hmm.

21:16.141 --> 21:17.709
I think.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.381
Timmy just watched.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.419
Like he was looking
right through it. Like--

21:28.553 --> 21:30.756
Like he wasn't there
or something.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.625
You know, Donna saw him.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.929
He was just
mumbling to himself,

21:37.929 --> 21:40.732
like, a bunch of names.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.804
And he just passed her by,
like she wasn't even there.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.906
[lighter clicks]

21:49.775 --> 21:51.543
I think something's wrong.

21:52.377 --> 21:54.579
He probably killed people
in 'Nam.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.581
[scoffs] It's like,
what do you expect?

21:56.581 --> 21:58.850
The same kid that
we used to sneak beers with

21:58.850 --> 21:59.951
in your tree house.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.630
[car door closes]

22:24.042 --> 22:26.678
[flies buzzing]

22:39.257 --> 22:41.960
Hey, Timmy. It's Jud.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.533
Timmy.

22:50.602 --> 22:51.870
[softly] Benson.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.107
[buzzing continues]

22:58.009 --> 23:00.045
[Timmy] Anderson.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.685
Jesus.

23:07.919 --> 23:09.421
Crandall.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.225
Right, uh, Timmy--

23:13.225 --> 23:14.659
[footsteps approaching]

23:14.659 --> 23:17.129
[footsteps running]

23:24.603 --> 23:26.004
What are you doing here?

23:27.205 --> 23:28.874
Mr. Baterman.

23:29.274 --> 23:30.575
Where's Timmy?

23:32.410 --> 23:33.678
Um...

23:34.479 --> 23:36.181
I-I came to see Timmy.

23:37.182 --> 23:41.086
We were here earlier,
and Hendrix attacked Norma.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.355
He's a good boy.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.457
He wouldn't attack
without a reason.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.763
Can I see Timmy?
Is that possible, please?

23:51.763 --> 23:56.201
Timmy's not taking
any visitors right now.

23:57.569 --> 24:00.972
He needs time to adjust.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.079
I'm worried about him, sir.

24:08.079 --> 24:09.447
Okay.

24:13.351 --> 24:14.686
I'm worried about him.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.088
We all are, Manny, Donna.

24:17.088 --> 24:20.559
There's something different.
He's-- He's--

24:21.660 --> 24:22.894
He's different.

24:25.363 --> 24:26.731
[sighs]

24:26.731 --> 24:29.201
You haven't been friends
with my boy for years.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.037
Why don't you just
enjoy that peace

24:32.037 --> 24:34.072
your daddy bought for you, and...

24:35.807 --> 24:37.776
That Dan Crandall
wouldn't want you mixed up

24:37.776 --> 24:39.878
in any such low business

24:39.878 --> 24:42.814
as a boy coming back
from the war, now would he?

24:42.814 --> 24:45.917
[stammering] My dad? What?

24:49.287 --> 24:51.022
Okay. All right. Okay.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.330
Just-- Will you tell him
that I said goodbye, please?

24:58.330 --> 25:00.265
[Timmy wheezing]

25:05.637 --> 25:08.974
[Timmy]
Kill 'em. Kill 'em all.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.909
[chattering]

25:12.444 --> 25:13.745
[gasps]

25:14.379 --> 25:15.914
You're back.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.148
Yeah, I'm back. I'm back.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.217
I don't understand.
What happened?

25:20.785 --> 25:24.089
Norma was attacked
by the Batermans' dog

25:24.089 --> 25:25.423
on the Baterman farm.

25:25.423 --> 25:26.491
[Kathy] Is she okay?

25:26.491 --> 25:27.425
[Jud] Yeah.
Shit.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.560
It's a long story.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.395
She's okay. She's all right.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.264
[Kathy] Oh, that's awful.

25:33.565 --> 25:34.733
She's gonna be fine,

25:34.733 --> 25:37.235
but we have to be here
a few more days.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.571
Guess that messes
with your plan

25:39.571 --> 25:41.806
to get me out of Ludlow, Dad.

25:44.776 --> 25:46.678
I should make Norma
a pie.

25:53.618 --> 25:54.953
[Jud] You know,
Bill Baterman knows

25:54.953 --> 25:58.089
that you have been pushing me
to leave. Why?

26:00.659 --> 26:03.161
You're hiding something.
Just tell me.

26:03.161 --> 26:04.362
[scoffs]

26:04.362 --> 26:06.865
[inhales deeply, sighs]

26:08.466 --> 26:13.104
Do you know what you are?
You are a hero without a cause.

26:13.104 --> 26:16.341
It's kind of like being
a rebel without a cause
but worse.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.178
Is that what
you told Doc Weitz?

26:22.113 --> 26:25.183
Paid him to lie for me.
What was it? Bone spurs?

26:26.217 --> 26:27.352
Fallen arches? What?

26:28.553 --> 26:31.990
Everything we've done
in our whole goddamn lives

26:31.990 --> 26:34.759
has been to protect you.
Okay, okay.

26:34.759 --> 26:40.065
I-- I-- I don't need you
to protect me, Dad.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.334
You do...

26:43.301 --> 26:46.671
if you won't
get the hell out of Ludlow.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.847
[Timmy wheezing]

26:55.847 --> 26:58.249
Marjorie Washburn.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.722
Sheriff Anderson.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.994
Mayor Benson.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.402
Dan Crandall.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.073
Jud Crandall.

27:23.742 --> 27:26.811
Manny Rivers.

27:27.812 --> 27:31.216
Donna Rivers.

27:34.252 --> 27:38.690
Kill 'em all
before they kill you.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.973
[muttering]

28:01.513 --> 28:03.882
The ones who know.

28:04.783 --> 28:06.818
Kill them all now.

28:07.318 --> 28:09.921
Kill them all now,

28:09.921 --> 28:11.990
before they kill you.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.295
Mmm.

28:29.808 --> 28:32.677
Hendrix, how you doing, boy?

28:32.677 --> 28:34.446
I got some jerky for you.

28:38.650 --> 28:39.651
Here.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.252
[growls]

28:42.587 --> 28:44.789
[footsteps approaching]
[gasps]

28:48.393 --> 28:49.427
Timmy.

28:51.629 --> 28:54.499
[voices whispering]

28:55.767 --> 28:57.669
I heard you were home.

28:57.669 --> 28:58.970
Am I home?

28:59.971 --> 29:01.739
'Cause I don't know.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.212
I'm starting to think
home is just another box.

29:08.413 --> 29:12.250
You know, like a mailbox
or like a coffin.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.118
[gasps]

29:13.118 --> 29:14.953
Just a place to store our shit

29:14.953 --> 29:16.254
and pretend that
we're not nothing

29:16.254 --> 29:18.857
for the little time
we got left.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.291
'Cause that's--

29:21.459 --> 29:24.496
that's what your dad said
right before
he hung himself, huh?

29:27.365 --> 29:28.366
Yeah.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.969
That must be hard, huh?

29:30.969 --> 29:33.338
Taking his mail route and all,

29:33.338 --> 29:35.773
walking in his footsteps
every day.

29:35.773 --> 29:40.011
Every day wondering
if today's the day
that you hang yourself too.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.315
Yeah.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.885
[growls]

29:46.885 --> 29:49.521
[voices whispering]

29:55.059 --> 29:57.295
[whispering continues]

30:03.468 --> 30:07.338
[chattering, laughing]

30:15.680 --> 30:17.248
[gasps]

30:39.437 --> 30:41.973
[Marjorie] It's some shit
Timmy Baterman said,

30:41.973 --> 30:43.675
and I can't shake the feeling

30:43.675 --> 30:46.678
we've got bigger problems
than animal control.

30:46.678 --> 30:50.348
Timmy Baterman
couldn't have quoted
your daddy's suicide note.

30:52.850 --> 30:55.186
You really think
Bill buried Timmy?

30:55.186 --> 30:59.090
[Marjorie]
This is how it starts,
just stirring up shit.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.993
Yeah, you're right.
That's how it starts.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.663
Stir shit up...
[Marjorie sighs]

31:05.663 --> 31:08.533
...knowing your secrets,
your darkest thoughts,

31:09.534 --> 31:11.069
playing with its food.

31:12.103 --> 31:15.073
Then people start dying.

31:15.073 --> 31:17.942
[Marjorie] <i>Then people start

[flies buzzing]

50:21.752 --> 50:23.420
Where's Hendrix?

50:23.420 --> 50:24.521
Dead.

50:28.125 --> 50:29.126
[slurping]

50:29.126 --> 50:31.027
Is that his blood?

50:31.928 --> 50:34.464
[groans] Nope.

50:37.167 --> 50:38.402
Timmy...

50:50.714 --> 50:52.182
Timmy ain't home.

51:08.064 --> 51:11.501
[sobbing]

51:17.140 --> 51:18.375
[engine turns off]

51:23.713 --> 51:25.582
Catch up with you
later, Manny.

51:25.582 --> 51:26.450
Hey, Kathy.

51:26.450 --> 51:28.318
Nice to see you, Manny.

51:36.793 --> 51:38.728
The founding families.

51:40.397 --> 51:44.434
Ludlow, Washburn, Anderson,
Benson, Bouchard...

51:48.271 --> 51:49.573
Crandall.

51:51.808 --> 51:53.743
That's us.

51:53.743 --> 51:55.345
It's our family.

51:59.049 --> 52:03.520
[Dan] There have always been
good forces and bad in Ludlow.

52:03.520 --> 52:08.158
We're all connected in a spiral.

52:09.526 --> 52:12.429
A chain that goes
back to our maker.

52:13.864 --> 52:16.800
And on our end,
we give the chain a tug.

52:17.734 --> 52:20.770
We call on our maker
and all that he's made.

52:20.770 --> 52:23.640
[voices whispering]

52:26.643 --> 52:28.845
[grunting]

52:32.048 --> 52:33.049
What is that?

52:33.049 --> 52:34.150
It'll do that.

52:35.118 --> 52:37.454
[distorted] Gets in your head.
Messes with your mind.

52:38.255 --> 52:40.156
That's why it
prefers the dead.

52:40.156 --> 52:42.592
[normal] Put up
less of a struggle.

52:43.426 --> 52:46.329
[distorted] It's evil.
Evil's evil, Jud.

52:47.931 --> 52:50.467
[normal] Your great-grandfather
built that deadfall

52:50.467 --> 52:52.569
to keep people
out of the woods.

52:57.707 --> 53:00.677
We've been
battling with this
for generations.

53:02.245 --> 53:05.048
Me, Marj, the sheriff, Benson.

53:05.048 --> 53:08.752
Our families made a pact
when this town was founded.

53:12.622 --> 53:15.425
This thing is
like a sickness.

53:16.660 --> 53:18.962
We have to stop it
from spreading.

53:21.831 --> 53:24.568
[voices whispering]

53:38.315 --> 53:40.550
[whispering continues]

54:01.805 --> 54:03.340
[whispering stops]

54:03.340 --> 54:06.576
I'll get the sheriff, Marjorie,
all of them. We'll tend to this.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.311
Dad, I--

54:09.613 --> 54:12.983
Just be careful, okay?

54:13.683 --> 54:14.718
I will.

54:17.020 --> 54:18.254
[engine starts]

54:39.576 --> 54:40.944
[flies buzzing]

54:45.915 --> 54:48.351
[buzzing continues]

54:52.255 --> 54:53.490
Donna?

54:57.861 --> 54:58.895
Donna?

55:03.099 --> 55:04.334
Donna!

55:05.869 --> 55:07.937
[Manny panting]

55:07.937 --> 55:09.039
[glass crunches]

55:11.941 --> 55:14.310
[bones creaking]
[footsteps thumping]

55:15.912 --> 55:18.048
[flies buzzing]

55:25.388 --> 55:26.856
[Norma, distorted]
Thank you.

55:34.497 --> 55:36.700
[buzzing continues]

55:38.234 --> 55:39.302
Donna?

55:39.302 --> 55:40.870
You know
this girl?

55:42.072 --> 55:43.106
What happened?

55:44.007 --> 55:45.975
I'm going to go
get the doctor.
[stammers]

55:45.975 --> 55:49.112
[footsteps retreating]

55:49.112 --> 55:51.414
[breathing shakily]

55:56.886 --> 55:57.921
Donna.

56:02.559 --> 56:04.327
[distorted]
Donna, can you hear me?

56:04.327 --> 56:06.062
[flies buzzing]
[bones creaking]

56:08.198 --> 56:09.733
Okay. Okay.

56:11.167 --> 56:12.502
Okay.

56:12.969 --> 56:14.003
You're freezing.

56:14.003 --> 56:15.939
Come here.
Come here.

56:17.340 --> 56:19.776
Hey. You're in shock.

56:26.116 --> 56:27.450
[flies buzzing]

56:27.450 --> 56:28.752
You're safe now.

56:36.159 --> 56:37.393
[water sloshes]

56:56.513 --> 56:58.114
[breathes shakily]

56:59.315 --> 57:00.683
[gasps]

57:06.089 --> 57:09.025
Donna, what happened?

57:10.660 --> 57:12.896
Such a good girl.

57:14.197 --> 57:20.336
Always a good girl,
pretending to love Jesus.

57:20.336 --> 57:22.205
But not you.

57:22.205 --> 57:23.506
[nurse screams]

57:24.841 --> 57:28.178
[objects clattering]
[people screaming]

57:28.178 --> 57:29.512
No.

57:29.512 --> 57:32.582
You hate the poor
and the rich

57:32.582 --> 57:35.118
and all the rest of us
so beneath you.

57:35.118 --> 57:37.320
So beneath you.

57:38.621 --> 57:42.892
But we all look the same when
we're beneath the ground, Norma.

57:43.593 --> 57:44.894
Shriveling.

57:46.429 --> 57:47.897
Sir, please help me.

57:47.897 --> 57:49.833
Please. Please!
Where are you going?

57:49.833 --> 57:51.668
[gasps]
[patient murmurs]

57:54.571 --> 57:55.805
Hello?

57:57.874 --> 57:59.209
Hey, will you help me?

58:05.315 --> 58:06.816
[screams]

58:07.517 --> 58:09.185
No!

58:16.192 --> 58:17.293
[bones creaking]

58:17.293 --> 58:18.494
[screams]

58:18.494 --> 58:20.830
No! No!
[chuckling]

58:20.830 --> 58:22.799
No! No!

58:28.605 --> 58:29.606

58:47.657 --> 58:50.126
[distorted]
Donna. Donna, please.

58:50.126 --> 58:51.227
[normal] Please.

58:55.298 --> 58:57.267
No, please.
No, come on.

58:57.267 --> 58:58.902
[distorted] Please! No!

59:03.206 --> 59:05.308
No, no, no. No!

59:12.715 --> 59:15.084
[grunting]

59:20.423 --> 59:22.325
[choking]

59:24.460 --> 59:26.029
[choking, coughing]

59:36.639 --> 59:40.043
Now, Bill, we can do this
the hard way or the harder way.

59:41.945 --> 59:43.379
Get off my property.

59:43.379 --> 59:44.681
Bill.

59:45.949 --> 59:47.684
What have you done?

59:48.952 --> 59:52.121
I thought it only fair
it give me back my son.

59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.263
Let me help you.

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.909
Norma!

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.345
[flies buzzing]

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.813
Norma?

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:19.115
[voices whispering]

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.932
[police radio chatter]

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:40.570
Manny.
Where's my fucking
sister, man?

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.171
You shouldn't
be here, son.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.942
Shit.

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.914
Judson, I told you
to stay away.

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.583
Norma's in there.
I'm going in. No.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:54.851
I'm going in! Dad--
No.

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.353
Dad.
Hell no.
It's too dangerous.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.791
I'm going in
with you.

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.931
You stay by my side.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:17.106
[Bill] All right, listen up.
Here's the plan.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:20.309
You go inside,
grab the girls
and get on out.

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:25.448
I'll go in and I'll hold Timmy
while you set the fire.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.350
Bill--

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.419
I held him the day
he came into this world...

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.823
and I'm gonna hold him
the day he goes out.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.759
You just burn this fucking
place to the ground.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.229
Here.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.900
Bill,
we'll take the barns.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.409
Got it?

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:59.315
You aim for their eyes.
That's the only way to end this.

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.311
[door closes]

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.347
I'll take upstairs.

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.517
[Benson screams]

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.867
[door creaks, closes]

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:38.507
Bill?

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.308
[flies buzzing]

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:24.987
[footsteps running]

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.140
Watch this door.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:51.380
[voices whispering]

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.355
[whispering continues]

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:04.226
[Jud] What? What is it?

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.462
Nothing.

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:08.898
Let's go.

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:10.299
Let's keep moving.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.639
[flies buzzing]

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:25.414
[voices continue whispering]

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.398
[flames roar]

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.444
[glass shatters]

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:57.980
Hey. You stay here.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.149
You do not move
until I come back.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.122
[Jud] Manny.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.257
These are Donna's.

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.229
Where's Donna?

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.498
[Donna] Where's Donna?

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.800
[flies buzzing]
[footsteps approaching]

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.368
Where's Norma?

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:20.970
[softly] Donna.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.805
Where's Manny?

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.373
Donna.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.111
He's nowhere.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.248
He's nothing.

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:35.050
He'll always be nothing.

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:37.686
Back up.
Back up.

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.688
Hey. Hey!
Back up!

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.057
Don't you fucking
shoot her, man.

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.159
Manny.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.493
Remember when
we were kids...

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:45.928
Manny.
...and we
used to dance?

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.096
Don't fucking
shoot her.

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:48.330
[groans]

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.399
Back up! Back up!
You should dance.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.700
Don't you
fucking shoot her.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.102
That's not Donna!
That's not her.

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.204
That's not her, Manny.
[groans]

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:56.672
Back up!
God! [groans]

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.174
I'm gonna shoot her!
You're better off dead.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.642
[gunshot]
Back!

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.547
[whimpering]

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:06.816
Manny.

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.851
Donna. Donna.

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.085
Look at me.
Look at me.

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:11.253
Donna.
It's okay.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.321
Hold on now.

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.522
[whispering]
Donna, Donna.

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:15.324
That wasn't Donna
anymore, son.

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.259
Sometimes dead is--

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.761
[blood squelching]

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.496
[groans, gasping]

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:29.205
[whimpers, gasps]

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:35.778
[gasping]
Dad? Dad?

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:36.979
Hey. Dad?

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.614
I'm sorry, Jud.

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:40.349
[grunts]

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:04.807
Place is on fire.
We got to get out of here.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.376
There's a cellar.
We can wait it out there.

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:09.445
[fire crackling]

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.185
Come on.

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:35.204
How long you think
we can survive down here?

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.206
Where does this go?

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:43.345
I don't know.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.247
Timmy must have dug that.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:50.886
Wait.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:57.059
This is Norma's necklace.
This is Norma's.

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:59.328
She's in that tunnel.
We can't go in there.

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:05.000
[Norma screaming]

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.902
Well, wake up,
Peace Corps.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.238
Manny.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.608
You guys can end this.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:17.913
[flies buzzing]

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.349
Oh, shit.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.555
[sighs]

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.759
[grunting, panting]

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:31.994
[chuckles]

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:35.264
[fire roaring]

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.601
She could be anywhere.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:15.904
We should split up.

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.041
You take down there.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:31.320
[Manny] Jud.

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:35.457
What if I find Norma
like-- like Donna?
