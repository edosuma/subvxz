01:04.765 --> 01:05.831
Sam.

01:07.467 --> 01:08.367
Sam.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.402
Come on.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.700
Did you sleep?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.202
Not really.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.146
Where are we?

02:29.349 --> 02:30.449
Nowhere.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.201
Son?

03:23.703 --> 03:25.337
Son?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.906
You all alone up here?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.641
Uh, oh no.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.910
I'm with my brother.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.246
Ah, well.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.982
You two lookin' for something
fun to do in the area, huh?

03:36.984 --> 03:39.551
You got
plenty to choose from.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.454
- Oh no, we're
just going camping.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.756
Oh camping.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.458
Yeah.

03:46.460 --> 03:51.563
The black bear campsite and
the flying loon campsite.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.865
Now, black bear campsite
is closed.

05:18.618 --> 05:23.322
- Let's try and rest our
eyes for a bit, okay?

05:23.324 --> 05:25.991
- Are there gonna be
actual beds there?

05:25.993 --> 05:30.362
- Yeah, there's beds and
a couch and a bathroom.

05:30.364 --> 05:34.599
I mean, it's like a normal
house, except it's small.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.405
I think there's a
TV, I'm not sure.

05:43.443 --> 05:44.609
Well, how is there cable

05:44.611 --> 05:46.611
if it's in the
middle of the woods?

05:46.613 --> 05:49.014
- I don't
know, the antenna?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.382
Is it heated?

05:50.384 --> 05:52.617
I can't remember.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.053
- Then what happens in the
winter when it gets cold?

05:55.055 --> 05:59.024
- Why don't we try and
rest for a moment, okay?

08:35.847 --> 08:37.849
You want anything else?

08:43.856 --> 08:44.756
Hm?

08:50.763 --> 08:52.631
Are you having fun?

08:54.700 --> 08:55.734
Yes.

08:55.736 --> 09:01.139
- I mean, it doesn't look
like you're having fun.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.974
I kinda feel weird.

09:05.845 --> 09:06.912
Weird how?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.951
It's like when I try to sleep.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.888
I can't stop thinking,

09:18.024 --> 09:21.993
and when I think I'm asleep,
turns out that I'm still awake,

09:25.231 --> 09:29.668
and then I kind of can't tell
what's like real or a dream,

09:33.039 --> 09:34.105
or whatever.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.011
What are you thinking of?

09:40.846 --> 09:42.714
You know, things.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.693
You wanna know what I think?

09:56.996 --> 10:01.232
If you wanna stop thinking or
dreaming about certain things,

10:03.035 --> 10:03.935
just stop.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.175
The things inside your head,

10:10.177 --> 10:12.877
they're only as real
as you want them to be.

10:12.879 --> 10:16.915
So if you want, you can just
decide they're not real.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.919
- Decide what's
not real, though?

10:21.854 --> 10:22.821
Everything.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.759
Everything from
before this trip.

10:27.761 --> 10:31.396
None of it exists, not
unless you want it to.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.001
Take this cup.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.904
It doesn't exist.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.374
Here, look at me.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.182
This is stupid.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.183
Trust me.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.687
But it's right there.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.122
What is?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.089
Your cup.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.767
What's going on?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.368
Nothing's going on.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.737
You're just a kid

11:12.739 --> 11:16.074
going on a camping trip
with your big brother.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.448
- Anything else
i can get for you two?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.083
Um, coffee to go?

11:27.253 --> 11:29.821
And a check, please.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.923
No problem.

11:31.925 --> 11:32.991
Thank you.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.116
Hey Joe.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.819
Didn't think I'd see
you till a little later.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.187
Go pay the lady.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.948
Don't get in there without me.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.599
Is it closed?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.037
Yeah, maybe.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.123
Excuse me.

16:51.276 --> 16:52.777
Hey, come here.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.290
This is Kelly.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.392
She works here.

17:09.028 --> 17:09.727
Hi.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.363
What's your name?

17:13.265 --> 17:14.432
Jeremiah.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.201
Oh, that's my cousin's name.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.570
- I was just telling
Kelly that we, uh,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.540
broke down up the road.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.175
Oh yeah.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.412
- Something got
knocked out of place.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.780
Not too sure.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.215
- Well there's a garage
not far from here.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.085
I could call you a
tow, if you want me to.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.321
- Yeah, I can
give you a ride down there

17:37.323 --> 17:38.790
if you don't mind
waiting a little bit.

17:38.792 --> 17:42.326
- Well, we'd really
appreciate it.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.394
Wouldn't we?

17:58.777 --> 18:01.446
Come on, put your clothes on.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.457
- Did you already tell her
what your real name is?

18:12.459 --> 18:13.691
Yeah.

18:14.626 --> 18:15.626
You suck.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.679
She wants to do you.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.750
I'm just being polite.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.286
You should go for it.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.420
Would you ever?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.424
Do it.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.327
Use her hole.

19:23.329 --> 19:27.498
I'll be right back.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.323
- Across
America, starting at...

19:58.498 --> 20:00.231
- top story,
there's new details tonight

20:00.233 --> 20:02.633
about the tragic fire that
destroyed a two-story home

20:02.635 --> 20:04.602
in new Brighton
several nights ago.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.338
Firefighters have discovered
the remains of an adult male,

20:07.340 --> 20:10.741
the owner of the
house, among the ruins.

21:29.488 --> 21:30.554
You awake?

21:40.766 --> 21:41.866
You okay?

21:41.868 --> 21:44.402
Get off me, you're gross.

21:49.775 --> 21:53.544
- She says this is
their off season.

21:53.546 --> 21:57.515
So basically no one's here
for the next few months.

21:58.617 --> 21:59.517
So?

22:00.619 --> 22:01.519
So.

22:03.021 --> 22:06.424
She said we can
stay here for free

22:06.426 --> 22:08.559
for however long we want.

22:11.029 --> 22:15.466
You know, some people live
in these places permanently.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.636
And I was thinking, things
aren't really workin' out

22:18.638 --> 22:21.405
the way they were supposed to.

22:21.973 --> 22:23.574
Or whatever.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.675
It's okay.

22:26.945 --> 22:31.615
I think what we do is we
stay here, figure things out,

22:31.617 --> 22:32.650
take our time.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.353
You know?

23:18.697 --> 23:20.164
Oh hi.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.065
Hi.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.135
Um, is this stuff free?

23:24.137 --> 23:27.571
- Yeah, of course, take
a much as you want.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.472
Okay.

23:28.474 --> 23:29.173
Here.

23:30.842 --> 23:34.011
Um, od you guys need
anything else in your room?

23:34.013 --> 23:35.646
Uh, no thank you.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.681
- I should show you where
the laundry room is,

23:37.683 --> 23:40.184
so you can wash your clothes
while you're staying.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.886
No thanks.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.587
No?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.489
Well, we're leaving.

23:46.825 --> 23:50.661
I mean, we're not staying,
so it'd be pointless.

23:50.663 --> 23:54.865
Because your brother said
you guys might stick around.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.534
He lied.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.669
Why would he lie?

23:58.671 --> 24:00.571
Because he's a liar.

24:01.673 --> 24:03.941
Oh, come on, he's a nice guy.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.443
Not he's not.

24:05.445 --> 24:10.581
Everything he's said since
he's got here has been a lie.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.682
Really?

24:15.821 --> 24:17.855
For starters, there's the fact

24:17.857 --> 24:20.691
that he doesn't even like girls.

24:20.693 --> 24:21.792
What?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.628
He's basically gay.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.765
He doesn't get hard with girls.

24:27.767 --> 24:31.802
- That's a really strange thing
to say about your brother.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.805
- And then, I guess
there's the fact

24:34.807 --> 24:38.242
that he's taking
advantage of you.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.078
I mean honestly, he
thinks your an idiot.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.514
You'll do whatever he wants.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.951
Well really, you don't
even know who he is.

24:56.027 --> 24:58.262
Actually, I was wondering.

25:00.599 --> 25:04.768
When you work out here,
in the middle of nowhere,

25:06.171 --> 25:09.106
how can you tell that some
random guy that shows up here

25:09.108 --> 25:11.876
is actually who he says he is?

25:12.711 --> 25:14.512
Like him, how can you tell

25:14.514 --> 25:18.749
that he's not like a kidnapper
or a murderer or something?

25:21.653 --> 25:23.787
And how can you tell
that isn't gonna like,

25:23.789 --> 25:26.524
rape you or kill you or rob you,

25:29.628 --> 25:32.930
or has that never even
crossed your mind?

25:34.065 --> 25:36.834
If I were you, it
definitely would.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.705
If I were you and i
met a guy like him,

25:41.707 --> 25:43.674
I'd probably like, run.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.128
Where were you?

26:26.651 --> 26:28.719
What did you say to her?

26:30.822 --> 26:33.591
She's really an idiot.

26:33.593 --> 26:34.625
She's even dumber than you are.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.455
Do you hate me now?

28:12.390 --> 28:13.290
Hm?

28:15.894 --> 28:18.062
- You can just go
ahead and kill me.

28:18.064 --> 28:21.765
I don't even care
where you bury my body.

28:27.005 --> 28:28.906
Do you wanna hit me?

28:32.877 --> 28:36.346
Would that make you feel better?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.181
I'm serious...

30:52.050 --> 30:53.884
stay behind me, okay?

30:55.353 --> 30:56.253
Okay?

30:56.255 --> 30:57.154
Okay.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.200
Hi there.

31:11.469 --> 31:13.437
Hey, how's it going?

31:13.439 --> 31:14.938
Fine, yourself?

31:14.940 --> 31:15.572
Can't complain.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.140
Beautiful day.

31:17.142 --> 31:18.876
Yeah.

31:18.878 --> 31:22.079
- It's not the season
for that yet, eh.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.513
Squirrels, maybe.

31:23.515 --> 31:27.584
- Ah, we're just doing
some target practice.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.919
- Where'd
you come in from?

31:28.921 --> 31:31.355
There's not much daylight left.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.157
Yeah, you're right.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.927
We're gonna head
back in a minute.

31:36.929 --> 31:40.964
What's the fastest
way back to the road?

31:40.966 --> 31:42.599
- Yeah, it's real easy,
you just head up this hill...

31:42.601 --> 31:44.167
what's your name?

31:44.169 --> 31:45.168
Jeremiah.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.105
- Better be careful out
here in those shorts,

31:48.107 --> 31:50.173
you will get poison Ivy.

31:51.176 --> 31:56.914
- I said you better be careful,
or you'll get poison Ivy.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.516
Oh, thanks.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.692
It's just the two of us

32:41.694 --> 32:44.127
the trees and the animals.

33:23.201 --> 33:26.236
- When was the last
time you were here?

33:29.607 --> 33:31.675
Was probably your age.

33:33.644 --> 33:36.313
Maybe uh, maybe a little older.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.652
We used to come
out in the summer,

33:42.654 --> 33:45.188
and then again in the fall.

33:46.457 --> 33:49.226
I hated it at first, but then.

33:51.496 --> 33:54.297
I guess I started to like it.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.077
Quit staring at me.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.416
What?

34:18.255 --> 34:20.389
That cat's being weird.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.770
I think he's possessed.

34:35.306 --> 34:39.141
I think he's like, a person
who's like reincarnated.

34:43.313 --> 34:44.380
Like, a guy.

34:48.085 --> 34:48.784
Mid-30s.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.358
It's definitely him.

35:10.675 --> 35:11.741
Come here.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.248
Keep your hand off the trigger.

35:19.717 --> 35:21.785
Get it on your shoulder.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.688
Aim with your right eye.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.191
When I say fire, fire.

35:37.235 --> 35:39.903
Fire.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.705
Hand off the trigger.

35:46.744 --> 35:47.644
Aim.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.714
When I say fire, fire.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.353
Fire.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.536
Check this out.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.440
Whoa.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.445
I slept in it overnight once.

36:24.916 --> 36:25.782
Liar.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.921
- I'm telling
you the truth.

36:30.923 --> 36:31.821
Why?

36:32.924 --> 36:35.725
- I was running
away from my dad.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.331
It looks really deep.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.667
- I don't actually
remember anything

36:43.669 --> 36:45.835
from when I was in there.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.540
I just remember coming
out and feeling different.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.942
Different how?

36:53.411 --> 36:56.813
- Kinda like I changed
into a new person.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.550
I mean, I was still me.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.620
It was like I traveled in a time

37:03.622 --> 37:07.357
where everything was
the same except, not.

37:48.366 --> 37:49.266
What?

37:55.006 --> 37:55.839
Nothing.

38:10.488 --> 38:11.621
What is that?

38:17.962 --> 38:18.962
Trust me.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.005
Tastes like honey.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.512
What's that?

38:43.821 --> 38:45.355
Maybe a bear.

39:30.034 --> 39:30.934
Run.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.673
There even any left?

41:50.675 --> 41:51.574
Barely.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.816
Hey, stop for a second.

41:59.818 --> 42:00.884
Put it away.

42:08.025 --> 42:08.925
Hey.

42:11.929 --> 42:13.630
Who's over there?

42:17.535 --> 42:18.601
Are you new?

42:21.272 --> 42:24.807
Eh, I don't think
he's like, one of us.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.277
Look how fucked up he is.

42:27.279 --> 42:31.714
- No, they're gonna
know that we're up here,

42:31.716 --> 42:32.649
and then...

42:32.651 --> 42:33.550
um.

42:37.755 --> 42:39.322
Do you have water?

43:10.054 --> 43:10.954
Here.

43:11.855 --> 43:12.956
Drink.

43:28.639 --> 43:30.840
You wanna tell me your name?

43:37.681 --> 43:39.182
Jeremiah.

43:39.184 --> 43:40.850
You're kidding.

43:40.852 --> 43:43.753
You stole my name.

43:43.755 --> 43:45.755
He's Jeremiah, too.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.924
I'm Gary, this is Luke.

43:56.634 --> 43:57.867
Can you stand?

44:11.148 --> 44:13.282
Hey gang, how's it going?

44:16.053 --> 44:17.654
Yeah, I know it's hot out here.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.889
We'll be done pretty soon.

44:28.065 --> 44:28.965
Hey.

44:31.201 --> 44:35.705
Don't say anything about
when we found you earlier.

44:35.707 --> 44:36.973
If he asks, just,

44:39.243 --> 44:40.843
we were chasing a stray cat,

44:40.845 --> 44:42.945
we just found you
there, all right?

44:42.947 --> 44:44.881
Okay.

44:44.883 --> 44:45.915
Good.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.948
- Whenever you're finished,
Jeremiah will show you

45:18.950 --> 45:22.118
where you can take a shower.

45:22.120 --> 45:26.022
Get him some clean
clothes to put on.

45:26.024 --> 45:30.026
And after you get
clean, we'll talk, okay?

45:30.028 --> 45:30.927
Okay.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.300
Good, right?

45:47.045 --> 45:49.846
to write down three
things you've learned

45:49.848 --> 45:52.415
while you were here, even
if they were little things

45:52.417 --> 45:55.885
that you can incorporate
into your life back home.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.353
- Those might
look poisonous.

45:57.355 --> 46:01.190
Those are actually ones
that are safe to eat.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.427
These should fit.

46:07.998 --> 46:08.965
Yeah, these are both for you,

46:08.967 --> 46:11.901
so just whatever, top or bottom.

46:14.972 --> 46:16.773
Okay.

46:16.775 --> 46:17.840
All right.

46:19.076 --> 46:22.879
There's a bathroom in
here you can change in.

46:22.881 --> 46:23.780
Take that.

46:31.055 --> 46:33.022
This is Max.

46:33.024 --> 46:35.391
You have dogs at home or cats?

46:38.495 --> 46:40.062
A cat.

46:40.064 --> 46:41.531
Just one?

46:41.533 --> 46:43.299
One official one.

46:43.301 --> 46:46.035
I feed a few strays though, too.

46:48.105 --> 46:50.173
You must like animals.

46:51.041 --> 46:54.477
What else can you tell
me about yourself?

47:00.083 --> 47:04.320
You know, I can't start to
help you unless you talk to me.

47:09.026 --> 47:12.094
Can you tell me
where you came from?

47:15.199 --> 47:16.265
The woods.

47:17.467 --> 47:18.534
The woods.

47:20.103 --> 47:22.038
What does that mean?

47:24.508 --> 47:27.210
I was in the woods camping.

47:27.978 --> 47:29.912
With who?

47:29.914 --> 47:31.080
My brother.

47:31.982 --> 47:34.617
And where's your brother now?

47:36.520 --> 47:38.020
I don't know.

47:46.129 --> 47:48.531
- Maybe we should
talk in the morning

47:48.533 --> 47:50.967
after you've had
a chance to rest.

47:50.969 --> 47:53.870
Come on Max, let's
go home, buddy.

47:56.907 --> 47:59.876
Can I just ask you
one other thing?

48:00.477 --> 48:01.611
Okay.

48:03.547 --> 48:05.615
What's your real name?

48:30.674 --> 48:31.574
Hey.

48:34.177 --> 48:35.077
Hey.

48:37.014 --> 48:37.914
What?

48:39.016 --> 48:42.184
- Did he ask about
where we found you?

48:42.186 --> 48:43.286
No.

48:44.488 --> 48:45.388
Good.

48:48.659 --> 48:50.660
What do you think?

48:50.662 --> 48:53.162
I think he's lying.

48:53.164 --> 48:56.065
- Why do
you think he's lying?

48:56.067 --> 48:58.267
Just my gut.

49:09.146 --> 49:11.547
We have to do weeds today.

49:12.649 --> 49:14.216
It's a rotating thing.

49:14.218 --> 49:15.952
Have you ever done
yard work before?

49:15.954 --> 49:17.186
No.

49:17.188 --> 49:20.323
You ever done anything before?

49:20.325 --> 49:21.257
We'll show you.

49:21.259 --> 49:22.491
It's not hard.

49:24.027 --> 49:25.127
- We need
to finish all this stuff

49:25.129 --> 49:26.462
by the end of today.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.164
You guys work in the
patch over there, okay?

49:28.166 --> 49:30.700
Stay out of those
woods over there.

49:30.702 --> 49:32.702
I hear that's where that
escaped killer's hiding.

49:32.704 --> 49:33.636
Shut up.

49:33.638 --> 49:38.007
Well you still gotta work
over there until lunch time.

49:38.009 --> 49:40.209
Jeremiah, are you listening?

49:44.114 --> 49:46.215
Yeah, I'm listening.

51:14.704 --> 51:18.307
- I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

51:18.309 --> 51:19.608
Come on.

51:40.163 --> 51:40.863
Finally.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.300
Gary wants to talk to you.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.614
- He looks
like a criminal.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.149
He is a criminal.

52:00.151 --> 52:04.220
- He's brought the cops here.
- He's dangerous.

52:04.222 --> 52:06.455
Guys, what the hell is he?

52:24.809 --> 52:27.543
Is that him there?

52:43.760 --> 52:45.528
Jeremiah!

53:01.845 --> 53:06.282
Okay gang, let's break it
up, move along, move along.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.717
Come on, let's go.

53:10.887 --> 53:14.323
- You're pretty fast
for a little guy.

53:15.625 --> 53:19.361
After what all
you've been through,

53:19.363 --> 53:21.497
you're a real brave kid.

53:21.499 --> 53:23.432
You know that?

53:23.434 --> 53:27.503
We've been lookin' hard
for you these past days.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.307
Where is he?

53:33.944 --> 53:35.678
He didn't make it.

53:37.247 --> 53:39.848
But we're just
glad we found you.

53:44.387 --> 53:45.287
Sam?

53:51.661 --> 53:52.561
Um.

53:54.698 --> 53:57.700
Can I use the
bathroom for a second?

54:00.237 --> 54:02.238
Sure.

54:25.729 --> 54:29.398
So what were you two doing
out there in the forest?

54:29.400 --> 54:30.499
Camping.

54:33.503 --> 54:36.705
- I mean, that's what
he told me to say.

54:37.941 --> 54:38.841
Sam, um.

54:40.644 --> 54:41.910
This might be uncomfortable,

54:41.912 --> 54:44.413
but I need to show
you a few things,

54:44.415 --> 54:48.651
and I need you to answer
honestly, the best you can, okay?

54:58.595 --> 55:00.396
Is this your house?

55:00.398 --> 55:02.531
You and your dad's house?

55:04.367 --> 55:05.434
Yes.

55:06.569 --> 55:07.936
And.

55:09.606 --> 55:10.873
Is this your dad?

55:14.811 --> 55:17.079
What about your mom?

55:17.081 --> 55:20.049
- Um, I don't know
where she lives.

55:23.053 --> 55:26.488
- How is your relationship
with your dad?

55:26.490 --> 55:27.389
Fine.

55:28.491 --> 55:30.893
Was he strict?

55:32.729 --> 55:33.629
I guess.

55:39.602 --> 55:42.705
But no more than
any other parent.

55:44.741 --> 55:45.641
Probably.

55:47.644 --> 55:48.544
Okay.

55:50.714 --> 55:52.081
Your friend Sarah told us

55:52.083 --> 55:56.418
that you spent a lot of
time at Nick's house.

55:56.420 --> 55:57.386
Um, yeah.

55:58.621 --> 56:01.523
That's because my
dad worked at night,

56:01.525 --> 56:05.561
so Nick would watch me,
as like favor to him.

56:08.565 --> 56:11.567
Since he lived
across the street.

56:12.669 --> 56:15.938
- And how long did
you do that for?

56:15.940 --> 56:16.839
Um.

56:18.608 --> 56:20.109
Since I moved in.

56:21.611 --> 56:25.447
- And that
was about two years ago?

56:25.449 --> 56:26.148
I guess.

56:29.853 --> 56:32.454
- We spoke to some
people who knew your dad.

56:32.456 --> 56:36.425
Looks like he was about
to start a new job.

56:36.427 --> 56:39.128
Way at the other
end of the state.

56:40.130 --> 56:42.598
Did you know about that?

56:42.600 --> 56:45.501
Yeah, we were about to move.

56:45.503 --> 56:49.605
- And how
did Nick feel about that?

56:49.607 --> 56:51.540
He didn't like it.

56:54.444 --> 56:57.613
He wanted me to live
with him instead.

57:05.855 --> 57:07.656
That's why he did it.

57:10.727 --> 57:12.127
What was that?

57:15.498 --> 57:18.200
- That's was why
he killed my dad.

57:26.176 --> 57:29.778
- What can you tell
me about that night?

57:32.148 --> 57:34.149
I don't know, really.

57:37.987 --> 57:42.224
I just remember he didn't want
me to look at him, my dad.

57:43.626 --> 57:44.760
Don't look.

57:56.873 --> 57:58.640
Go get your stuff.

58:09.786 --> 58:10.752
Wait, stop!

58:42.685 --> 58:43.585
Okay.

58:45.788 --> 58:47.556
So Sam, with Nick.

58:51.728 --> 58:52.995
Did he touch you?

58:58.067 --> 58:59.234
Breathe in.

59:01.237 --> 59:02.137
And out.

59:05.775 --> 59:06.675
And in.

59:09.112 --> 59:10.012
And out.

59:25.995 --> 59:29.197
- Your knees
should be up at your chest,

59:29.199 --> 59:31.767
sort of like how a cat sleeps.

59:34.671 --> 59:37.773
You're going to feel
some pressure now.

59:41.945 --> 59:44.646
Do you have a pet cat or dog?

59:47.083 --> 59:47.983
A cat.

59:50.153 --> 59:53.088
- There's no physical
evidence of sexual abuse,

59:53.090 --> 59:56.959
but you know, it's rare
that there would be

59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.295
I look through his statement.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.364
He's been through a lot.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.906
- Brief
conversation with the pair.

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:14.242
But at least thought their
odd behavior was explainable.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:17.012
That is, until they got
home and turned on the news.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.313
- I knew there
was something weird

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.915
about them being out there,

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.883
but we didn't think
too much about it,

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:26.154
so then when I saw them on
the TV, I knew it was him.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.957
I said, that's the kid
that you saw out there?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.860
So that's when I called.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:35.664
Track down the abducted child.

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.841
We all signed it,

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.311
and there was an assembly
for the whole school

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.314
where the police came
and talked about it.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.215
Really?

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.817
Yeah.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.153
Everybody's talking about it.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.988
That's kinda weird.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.928
What?

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.298
I don't know.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:32.988
Do you um, have any
questions about anything?

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.357
It's just like a normal house.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:37.826
Come on, Sarah,

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:40.128
let's let him get settled in.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.886
- Do you think it'd be
fun to take care of animals?

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.055
Like on a farm?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:11.293
- Yeah, and like planting and
growing vegetables and stuff.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.864
I used to think that
kind of thing would suck,

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:20.836
but the more I think about
it, the more it seems awesome.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:23.905
- It might get
boring after a while.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.442
This is so weird.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:29.745
You're in my room, but
like, a few days ago,

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:32.981
I totally thought you were dead.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.050
Sorry, that's messed up.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.856
It's so crazy to think that
you never really know a person,

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:41.757
you know?

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:48.363
My mom says she knew
someone that dated him once.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.365
I mean, a girl his age.

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.902
It's just kind of
a shock, I guess,

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:57.072
that he turned out
to be such a weirdo.

01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:57.973
Yeah.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:05.781
- Was it like, mainly
him doing things to you?

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:08.850
Or did he make you
do things to him?

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:12.320
It was kind of both, I guess.

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:19.094
You know what's funny?

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:23.331
thinks we're boyfriend
and girlfriend.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:27.302
I didn't say anything,
they just, like, assume.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.976
Can I tell you something?

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.046
Sure.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.217
- Okay, um, I just
wanted to tell you

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:45.821
that I didn't say
anything to the police

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.590
about you and your dad.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.827
Huh?

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.966
- They read our texts,
that's how they found out.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:03:59.267
Found out what?

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:03.538
- Just about how you
didn't wanna move,

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:07.843
and how you wished
your dad was dead.

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:12.147
I don't think it
matters, though.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:14.216
I told them you were joking.

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:17.519
I mean, every teenager
ever says that.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:21.957
I just didn't want you to
think I came out and told them.

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.263
Okay.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.400
- I don't, like, know
what was going on.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:36.638
I mean, I would never say
anything, no matter what,

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.275
even if you weren't joking.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.510
Even.

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.171
Stop.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.407
Get off.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.475
It's okay.

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.611
Seriously, get off.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.523
I was lying before.

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:33.295
About what people said about us.

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:35.597
Nobody really thought that.

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.301
I get it.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.104
It's actually so obvious.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.140
What is?

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:50.145
- That you were
in love with him.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:51.246
Are.

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.281
Whatever.

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:29.511
- They'll come
looking for you eventually.

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:32.113
You're just making them mad.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:36.518
I don't care.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.823
- If he ever gets
physical with you again,

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:45.093
I want you to stand
up for yourself.

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:50.265
If I was there, and I saw
him doing anything to you,

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.433
I'd kill him.

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:12.654
Is this you?

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.828
That was my dad's last kill.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.430
I was your age.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:30.705
Actually, I bet
you'd love it there.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:34.242
I could teach you
how to hunt and fish.

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:40.348
Nobody would bother us.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.818
Nobody except the
plants and the animals.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:49.624
I mean.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.528
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:14.742
You wanted to see me?

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:15.643
Come in.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.481
How's the arm?

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:21.749
It's fine.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:22.984
Good.

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.352
I just wanted to
check in with you,

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:26.788
see how you're doing lately.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:27.689
Fine.

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.391
Why?

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.661
- I heard that you've been
having nightmares again.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:34.829
Is that true?

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.001
Yes.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.505
Care to tell me about 'em?

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.512
Remember what we agreed on.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.850
You're going to have
to be open with me

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:57.885
while you're here, okay?

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:03.458
Okay.

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:06.794
Um.

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:13.635
It's kind of like I'm
always just laying there.

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:20.508
Sam, you awake?

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:21.409
I'm home.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.987
Sorry about earlier.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:50.738
I'm unlocking your door.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.442
If you wanna talk to
me, come talk to me.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.086
It's okay, Sam.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:06.654
What happens next?

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.624
Sam.

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:47.962
Remember, it's all in your head.

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:50.865
It's not real.

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.937
But it feels like it is.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:00.141
Well, I promise you it's not.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:05.046
It's only as real as
you want it to be.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:11.119
How do I get it to stop?

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:13.721
You control your own mind.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:17.592
If you want it to
stop, make it stop.

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.059
What are you doing here?
