Fairies or you?

11:30.657 --> 11:33.358
Well, I make the dresses
for the fairies

11:33.393 --> 11:35.260
and I can make a special one
for you.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.428
(Lena)
'Oh, you don't have to do that.'

11:36.530 --> 11:37.729
(Karina)
Nonsense.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.798
Come on, let's go
get you measured.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.104
[indistinct song playing]

11:59.352 --> 12:01.453
So I'll see you
for dinner, instead.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.993
[song continues]

12:34.421 --> 12:38.223
This is more beautiful than
my mind could ever think of.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.125
We, uh,
we can't thank you enough.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.994
You're nice people.
It was my pleasure.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.662
Sweetie, go get dressed
'cause I've to get

12:44.765 --> 12:46.397
to the post office
before it closes, okay?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.067
But I never wanna take this off.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.171
I can watch her
while you head over.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.206
- Are you sure?
- It's no problem at all.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.708
Okay, I'll be real quick.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.843
Be dressed and ready
when I get back, okay, honey?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.211
Thank you.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.180
Mallie, I have to help
this customer

13:02.282 --> 13:03.548
right here for just a sec.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.216
But over there
there's a book shelf.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.885
You can read any book
that you want to.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.020
Okay? I'll be right with you.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.955
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, how are you doing?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.025
Great. Um, are you interested
in this crib?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.760
(female #1)
'Yes, I am. I'm very interested
in this crib.'

13:15.796 --> 13:18.496
(Karina)
'Well, my husband designs
all the cribs.'

13:18.598 --> 13:20.031
'He does all the woodwork
himself'

13:20.133 --> 13:22.567
'and it's kinda supposed
to be reminiscent of'

13:22.602 --> 13:24.702
what you would have played with
at your grandparents' house

13:24.805 --> 13:25.770
when you were young.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.605
'Awesome.'

13:27.641 --> 13:31.042
Um, and he also designed
the dresser to match

13:31.144 --> 13:33.311
so it's kind of a set, uh..

13:33.346 --> 13:35.446
It's trending
with all the hipster parents.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.081
[indistinct chatter]

13:37.117 --> 13:39.117
Mallie, stop!

13:40.487 --> 13:42.887
Hey! Hey!

13:42.989 --> 13:45.924
[intense music]

13:53.533 --> 13:55.834
Honey, sit down,
just read a book right there.

14:00.006 --> 14:04.075
[panting]
Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.645
Oh. Hey.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.314
- What's going on?
- We need to call the police.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.316
Why?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.551
A man,
he-he tried to take Mallie.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.753
I think, I'm-I'm assuming
that it wasn't her father.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.589
(Lena)
'No, her father's
not in the picture.'

14:17.691 --> 14:21.793
Okay. If I hadn't stopped him,
he just, he would've taken her.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.729
You did, okay?

14:24.831 --> 14:27.432
You came to the rescue,
so don't, don't call the police.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.933
A man tried to kidnap
your daughter

14:29.035 --> 14:30.168
and you don't wanna
call the police?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.737
I don't wanna alarm her.

14:32.839 --> 14:36.474
Can you imagine a little girl,
her age, talking to the cops?

14:36.509 --> 14:38.676
They're not exactly good
with kids.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.946
How can you be so calm?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.148
It's just, children pick up

14:44.184 --> 14:45.483
on a lot more than they let on

14:45.518 --> 14:46.851
and I just..

14:46.887 --> 14:48.453
Please, I-I, I don't wanna

14:48.555 --> 14:50.121
make her feel unsafe.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.689
You understand?

14:51.725 --> 14:54.325
Please, I-I..

14:54.361 --> 14:57.495
I'm so sorry,
it happened so quick and I--

14:57.530 --> 15:00.798
Honey, you did, you did great.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.800
Really, you're a..

15:02.903 --> 15:05.436
You're a godsend,
I mean, I don't..

15:05.538 --> 15:09.540
Oh, my God. How am I ever
going to repay you. Oh.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.777
Actually, I could start
by-by paying you, I mean..

15:12.879 --> 15:15.246
- Here. Please take, take extra.
- No, no, no.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.316
It's okay, it's okay. Um..

15:19.252 --> 15:20.952
[sighs]

15:21.054 --> 15:23.554
I don't know, maybe we could
go out for a-a bite sometime

15:23.590 --> 15:25.223
you know, I don't know
very many people around here.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.491
Oh, honey,
a bite would be great.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.626
- Okay.
- On me, okay?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.028
- Okay?
- We'll see.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.330
- On me!
- Okay.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.734
Thank you.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.406
[intense music]

15:44.010 --> 15:47.812
Just keep thinking I should've
reported the incident today.

15:47.847 --> 15:51.215
I mean,
what, what if it happens again?

15:51.351 --> 15:52.951
Well, you definitely should
let people know

15:52.986 --> 15:56.721
but you got to respect
her privacy.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.959
Yeah, but what happens if he
succeeds next time? Then what?

16:00.994 --> 16:04.395
Oh, that's why we all
have to exercise caution.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.231
How, when she won't report it?

16:07.367 --> 16:10.134
Maybe she doesn't wanna
scare her daughter.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.270
Yeah, but what about
other people's children?

16:15.809 --> 16:18.276
I bet you spooked him.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.746
- He won't be back.
- I hope you're right.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.418
Turn that brain off.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.589
- Go to sleep.
- Okay.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.424
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.270
- I am so glad that we did this.
- Yeah.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.273
I just, I don't tend
to get out on my own.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.276
Well, the life of a single
mother must not be easy.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.446
[sighs]
Uh, I know that I'm not
the only one in town

16:55.582 --> 16:58.182
but it really feels like it
sometimes.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.283
- You know?
- Yeah.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.285
Does your ex help out at all?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.654
He..

17:03.690 --> 17:05.690
[indistinct chatter]

17:05.725 --> 17:08.159
[intense music]

17:08.194 --> 17:11.329
I prefer to keep anything
involving him in the past.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.065
I mean,
Mallie and I moving here

17:14.100 --> 17:16.501
was really about a fresh start

17:16.536 --> 17:17.802
you know,
so it's important for me to--

17:17.937 --> 17:19.237
Yeah, I--

17:19.272 --> 17:21.372
Lena! Congrats are in order.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.541
Dylan told me that Mallie won
the Eager Reader Award.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.477
- Oh, hey. Thank you.
- I'm not surprised.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.246
Hi. I don't know you, I'm Emma.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.982
Hi, I'm Karina.
Nice to meet you.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.217
- Our kids share a teacher.
- Oh.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.886
And thank goodness
it's Mallie, too.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.922
I mean, Dylan could never.
I mean, he's way too shy.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.158
'But your little Miss Thing
is gonna steal the show!'

17:40.293 --> 17:43.828
Yeah, I'm, I'm not sure Mallie
wants to be part of a show.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.164
Oh, but she has to,
we're gonna have all the winners

17:46.299 --> 17:48.232
read a passage
from their favorite book

17:48.268 --> 17:50.701
you know, to inspire
the other kids to read.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.870
I'm head
of the parents' association.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.239
We're always looking
for volunteers. Are you local?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.942
I am, I own
a children's store on 3rd.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.877
Get out! What's it called?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.679
Juvenile Shop
Children's Boutique.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.515
I know it.
I'm gonna peek by for myself.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.417
Mallie got a dress
from my shop that I made.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.685
- She wanted--
- Actually, about the--

18:07.821 --> 18:09.854
No kidding!

18:09.989 --> 18:12.523
We should have you
present an award to the kids.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.991
You know, we need to show..

18:14.094 --> 18:17.028
[intense music]

18:20.500 --> 18:22.366
...our community
supports each other

18:22.502 --> 18:25.369
and it would be great exposure
for your shop.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.873
- I would love it.
- Lena, always good to see you.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.908
And, Karina, nice to meet you.
I've got to run.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.245
Always a million things.
I'll be in touch.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.248
She's a ball of energy, huh?

18:37.283 --> 18:39.217
Oh, she sure is.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.721
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.557
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Will Mallie be excited?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.826
Yeah, I guess I am.

18:48.862 --> 18:52.063
Have to take back all of that.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.898
Oh, my God, I-I..

18:53.967 --> 18:56.501
I'm so sorry, I thought that
you, you changed your mind

18:56.536 --> 18:58.069
I assumed that--

18:58.204 --> 19:01.739
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Oh. I..

19:01.875 --> 19:04.809
Did Mallie say anything
about the other day?

19:04.844 --> 19:09.614
She, uh, she thought the man
knew where the fairies lived

19:09.649 --> 19:11.916
and was about to go
right along with him.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.719
[sighs]
See why I have to keep
such a tight leash on her?

19:14.821 --> 19:18.256
I mean, she's amazing,
but she's a handful.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.792
Well, I can help keep eyes
on her if you'd like me to.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.628
That's.. I don't wanna
burden you with that.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.797
It's not a burden.
It's what you do.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.801
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.439
[intense music]

19:38.711 --> 19:41.379
Sounds like you made that
new friend you were hoping for.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.047
Is it strange
that I feel more connected

19:43.082 --> 19:45.716
to Lena's kid than to her?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.585
You want one just like her?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.221
I do.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.156
Careful, Lena's gonna think
maybe you're trying

19:52.192 --> 19:54.492
to swipe her for yourself.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.860
Poor Lena.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.996
You know, she was
so unnecessarily worried

19:59.098 --> 20:02.733
about the worst thing happening,
and then it almost did.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.468
This is the world
that we're living in

20:04.537 --> 20:07.838
and this is why
I have such hesitation.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.173
What if I can't protect--

20:09.209 --> 20:11.242
Don't start thinking like that.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.744
We live in the kind of world
that we make for ourselves

20:13.780 --> 20:15.213
and you and I
are working towards

20:15.248 --> 20:16.914
the life we've always wanted.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.884
[instrumental music]

20:19.919 --> 20:21.185
We are.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.193
- Speaking of work..
- Karina..

20:29.229 --> 20:31.696
You have everything it takes
to be a great mother.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.235
- I'm glad you're so sure.
- I am.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.806
I wanna be sure, too.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.911
I just hope that one day..

20:46.946 --> 20:50.414
...I can be everything
that a child needs.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.223
[bird cawing]

21:01.761 --> 21:03.361
More sugar, anyone?

21:03.396 --> 21:06.564
Mine is perfect. Thank you.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.866
Mine needs more flavor.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.435
What kind of tea
are we having today, my love?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.171
- 'Oh!'
- Ooh.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.240
I thought I detected, um

21:16.276 --> 21:20.044
fresh notes of the garden
in my tea.

21:20.079 --> 21:23.080
- Delicious, like always.
- Mm-hmm.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.017
Oh, honey, mommy really needs
some caffeine.

21:26.119 --> 21:30.388
Are you okay if I go inside and
make Karina and I some coffee?

21:30.423 --> 21:33.057
Sure, and then you can
get rid of the yucky taste

21:33.092 --> 21:36.027
with my world-famous
delicious tea!

21:36.129 --> 21:38.329
(Lena)
Okay, my love.
I'll be right back.

21:40.767 --> 21:45.236
So, Mallie, did you come up
with this recipe yourself?

21:45.271 --> 21:47.238
Yeah. I just maked it up.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.440
Well, it's delicious.

21:49.475 --> 21:53.177
Well, I've been having tea
parties for a very long time.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.612
[laughs]

21:54.647 --> 21:57.048
I used to have tea parties
with my dolls.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.817
Brings back very good memories.

21:59.852 --> 22:03.421
Yeah, me, too.
I miss my dolls sometimes.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.757
- Well, where are they?
- I-I don't know.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.293
I had different dolls and toys

22:09.329 --> 22:11.762
when I was called Emily.

22:11.798 --> 22:15.599
Well, is Mallie
your middle name?

22:15.635 --> 22:19.470
No. At my other house
my name was Emily.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.909
Right.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.912
You moved here right before
you started school.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.447
Yup.

22:29.482 --> 22:33.751
Well, did you change your name
when you started school?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.322
Mallie?

22:40.193 --> 22:42.460
(Mallie)
Mom, can we have those treats

22:42.495 --> 22:44.695
you were saving
for a special day?

22:46.499 --> 22:49.767
Well, you're gonna break me down
anyway, so, yes.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.269
- 'But only one, okay, love?'
- Okay.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.973
[chuckles]

22:56.008 --> 22:58.576
The coffee will just be
another minute.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.811
This is nice.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.114
Yeah, it is.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.149
You gotta, you gotta watch her.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.518
She'll take two
and tell you otherwise.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.120
[both laughing]

23:09.222 --> 23:13.357
- Yeah, she's quite a character.
- Yeah, she is.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.626
She, um..

23:15.728 --> 23:18.095
She told me
her name used to be Emily.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.131
[laughs]

23:20.233 --> 23:21.432
Really?

23:24.203 --> 23:27.505
Last week she was telling people
that her mom was famous.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.140
Can you imagine
their disappointment

23:29.242 --> 23:32.009
when they meet me? I mean..

23:32.044 --> 23:34.779
Oh. What am I gonna do with her?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.387
It's odd, isn't it?

23:43.423 --> 23:46.023
(Ryan)
'It is, but she's a kid.'

23:46.058 --> 23:48.426
'Kids say things and don't
analyze them the way adults do.'

23:48.461 --> 23:51.896
Yeah, but what if she was trying
to tell me something?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.799
- What do you think's going on?
- I don't know.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.168
But what if something is?

23:57.270 --> 23:58.869
Well, you asked Lena
and she gave you an answer

23:58.905 --> 24:00.204
but you weren't satisfied
with it.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.841
I think
she was dodging my question.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.178
Well, uh, she left her husband
or something along those lines.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.879
Maybe she needs to protect
their identity.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.249
But what if it's not that
and it's something worse?

24:12.285 --> 24:13.551
[door chimes chiming]

24:13.586 --> 24:15.119
Hold that thought.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.362
Emma? Hi.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.164
What a little treasure trove.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.633
I can't believe
I've not been here before.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.069
Oh, I brought you a flyer
for the assembly.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.704
Thanks.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.906
Gosh, really, just too cute.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.942
Oh, it was so great
meeting you the other day

24:37.977 --> 24:40.044
and thanks so much
for stopping by.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.779
I'm sorry I interrupted.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.114
But Lena would've kept you all
to herself now, wouldn't she?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.650
She keeps a lot of things
to herself.

24:46.686 --> 24:50.387
I mean, you know, in contrast to
Mallie because she's just such--

24:50.490 --> 24:52.923
A little spitfire? I know it.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.725
Dylan had kindergarten
with her, too.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.228
So you must know them
really well.

24:57.330 --> 25:01.232
No one does. Lena keeps
her head down and to herself.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.901
Which is why I was so happy
to see her with you.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.704
Well, yeah.
Why do you think that is?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.772
Well, she's a pinch older.

25:08.808 --> 25:12.142
And, well, despite our efforts
to rope her in

25:12.178 --> 25:14.512
she doesn't strike me
as much of a joiner.

25:17.183 --> 25:21.285
Yeah, well, you know, it must be
hard being all on her own.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.522
But, I mean, let your kid take
a school picture, am I right?

25:25.491 --> 25:26.490
What do you mean?

25:26.526 --> 25:28.425
Mallie doesn't do a picture day.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.895
Lena is afraid
of child predators

25:30.997 --> 25:32.930
and how stressful
to be wired that way.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.532
But enough about Lena.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.302
'I don't want you thinking
I'm all gossipy'

25:38.337 --> 25:39.904
when we're just
getting to know each other.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.673
- No, that's not--
- I'm kidding.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.642
I'm kidding.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.644
But I'm telling you,
get ready for a rush

25:46.679 --> 25:48.913
because I'm gonna tell everyone
about this place.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.915
That's so nice of you.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.985
Do you hike? I have a group.

25:55.021 --> 25:58.822
We, uh, hit the trail and then
we gorge ourselves over lunch.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.791
Sounds like my kind of group.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.860
I know where to find you.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.335
<i> (Karina)</i>
<i> The books I ordered came in</i>

26:11.370 --> 26:14.004
so I thought I'd swing by
Lena's and drop 'em off

26:14.040 --> 26:15.472
to save her a trip.

26:15.508 --> 26:17.508
I should be home
within the hour.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.143
(Ryan on phone)
'No rush.'

26:19.178 --> 26:21.045
- Okay, bye.
- 'Bye.'

26:24.884 --> 26:26.784
[thuds]

26:29.021 --> 26:30.888
[cat meows]

26:32.258 --> 26:35.159
[intense music]

26:48.207 --> 26:51.175
[line ringing]

26:58.284 --> 27:01.185
(Lena on voicemail)
'Hi, it's Lena. Sorry I missed
your call. Leave a message.'

27:08.794 --> 27:11.795
[woman screaming]

27:15.267 --> 27:17.067
(woman on phone)
'911. What's your emergency?'

27:17.103 --> 27:22.906
Yeah, hi, I'm at
1-1-0-3-0 Woodland Avenue.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.376
There's an incident,
uh, an altercation, maybe.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.077
I think my friend's in trouble.

27:27.113 --> 27:30.614
- 'Are you inside the home now?'
- No, I'm-I'm in the car.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.549
I just saw a man
go into the house.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.685
I, I think
I hear them struggling.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.720
'Officers
are on their way, ma'am.'

27:36.822 --> 27:38.455
'Please stay
inside your vehicle.'

27:38.491 --> 27:39.523
Thank you.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.526
[indistinct chatter]

27:46.465 --> 27:49.366
- 'Right now!'
- 'Lena, Lena..'

27:49.468 --> 27:50.467
(male #1)
'Lena, put that down.'

27:50.503 --> 27:51.869
[indistinct chatter]

27:52.004 --> 27:53.637
'Lena, put that down!'

27:53.673 --> 27:56.674
[indistinct chatter]

28:02.481 --> 28:04.982
[indistinct yelling]

28:05.017 --> 28:08.152
(Lena)
'It is none of your business.
Keep her out of this.'

28:08.187 --> 28:12.322
(male #1)
'Okay. You have to stop.
Lena, no, put that down.'

28:12.358 --> 28:15.492
'Put that.. Lena, no, no! No.'

28:15.528 --> 28:17.094
(Lena)
'Get out!'

28:17.196 --> 28:20.597
'Get out! I said get out!'

28:23.869 --> 28:24.802
[screams]

28:24.837 --> 28:25.869
Sorry.

28:28.541 --> 28:31.241
[panting]

28:31.343 --> 28:34.078
[intense music]

28:34.180 --> 28:35.612
[siren blaring]

28:37.383 --> 28:39.750
Karina?
Wh-what are you doing here?

28:39.885 --> 28:43.420
Lena, I called the police,
they're on their way.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.790
Lena! Lena, are you okay?

28:46.892 --> 28:50.094
Lena! God! Are you alright?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.529
I-I heard you scream
and there was glass breaking--

28:52.565 --> 28:56.734
It-it was just an unsuccessful
burglary, that's all.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.342
Well, you did the right thing.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.711
Is she okay?

29:07.747 --> 29:09.480
She can sleep
through an air raid.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.181
[chuckles]

29:11.217 --> 29:13.817
Lena, why don't I
take the couch tonight?

29:13.853 --> 29:16.887
No, we're... We're fine.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.622
I mean,
the police were thorough.

29:18.724 --> 29:21.558
There's no reason for you
to trouble yourself, really.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.660
It's no trouble.

29:23.696 --> 29:26.163
It's just,
then I'd have to explain

29:26.198 --> 29:28.632
why you're here and, you know

29:28.734 --> 29:30.033
right now she doesn't know
anything's amiss.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.202
I would, I would just

29:32.238 --> 29:35.072
rather keep everything
status quo for now.

29:36.709 --> 29:37.975
Understood.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.579
What did you tell the police?

29:45.551 --> 29:47.651
Exactly what I told you.

29:47.753 --> 29:50.754
[scoffs]
The same story.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.557
I'm surprised
they didn't wanna question me.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.359
Oh, I'm sure they have

29:55.394 --> 29:58.695
bigger emergencies
to tend to than this.

29:58.731 --> 30:03.500
I mean, I didn't wanna
keep them when we're fine.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.407
[intense music]

30:17.082 --> 30:19.917
(Ryan)
So what's your analysis?

30:19.952 --> 30:22.452
- What?
- Well, is it edible?

30:23.789 --> 30:25.055
Thank you.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.292
Thank you.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.128
I'm sorry, babe.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.399
I don't mind you
being out to lunch

30:35.434 --> 30:37.367
but we're currently
out to dinner.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.602
I know.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.538
I just have this bad feeling
I can't shake.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.540
Can you please try?

30:45.144 --> 30:47.211
What if Mallie is in danger?

30:48.314 --> 30:50.414
What if she needs our help?

30:50.449 --> 30:53.217
Look, we can only be
so involved.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.153
I mean, I understand that Mallie
has an over-active imagination

30:56.188 --> 30:58.288
but I don't buy that
as an excuse

30:58.324 --> 31:01.391
to hide what's going on
around her.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.793
Would you do that?

31:02.828 --> 31:05.596
No, but we're not her parents.

31:05.631 --> 31:09.099
Just if something else
happens to her and we're--

31:09.134 --> 31:13.170
Your empathy for her is a sign
you're gonna be a great mother

31:13.205 --> 31:15.772
but we have to let
Mallie's mother

31:15.808 --> 31:17.241
take care of her daughter
her way.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.909
I get it.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.578
You want me to drop
this whole thing.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.813
[sighs]

31:22.848 --> 31:25.082
Maybe I am misreading it.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.385
But if I'm not

31:28.487 --> 31:32.956
do you promise
that if Mallie's in danger

31:32.992 --> 31:34.791
'we will help her?'

31:38.497 --> 31:40.864
(Ryan)
Of course.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.268
I've always got your back.
You know that, right?

31:44.370 --> 31:45.636
I know.

31:46.705 --> 31:47.804
Thanks.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.176
- Eat before it gets cold.
- Yeah.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.814
(Lena)
'Luckily, they're gonna keep
the incident under wraps, so..'

31:57.850 --> 32:00.050
(Karina)
'I'm so surprised you think
they want to alert the public.'

32:00.085 --> 32:02.753
Well, I, I shared with them
that I've spent years

32:02.855 --> 32:04.955
trying to conceal our
whereabouts from my ex-husband

32:05.057 --> 32:07.291
and if they ran a story on me

32:07.393 --> 32:09.626
all of those efforts
would go to waste, so..

32:09.728 --> 32:11.094
So your ex-husband,
do you think that he's the one

32:11.196 --> 32:12.930
that tried to take Mallie?

32:13.032 --> 32:16.700
Oh, it was almost successful
when she was a little baby

32:16.735 --> 32:18.969
but I'll never let that
happen again.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.905
So it wasn't him.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.141
When's the last time you've..

32:24.243 --> 32:28.712
I've spent so many years
off the radar for Mallie's sake

32:28.747 --> 32:31.715
it's-it's not natural for me to

32:31.750 --> 32:33.583
you know,
settle into a community.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.153
But you have been

32:36.255 --> 32:39.222
just a wonderful gift for us.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.358
- Oh, you guys, too.
- Don't get me wrong.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.527
I mean, the parents here
are, are welcoming.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.195
It's just

32:45.230 --> 32:48.899
they're so involved
in everybody's lives, you know

32:48.934 --> 32:52.135
it's just, it's nice to have
a friendship that isn't forced

32:52.237 --> 32:54.404
because, you know,
a play date went well.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.839
Yeah.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.575
So when are you and Ryan

32:58.610 --> 33:00.711
getting
in the baby-making business?

33:01.947 --> 33:03.947
Technically, we already are.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.791
What did I tell you?
Isn't this the cutest ever?

33:14.827 --> 33:17.494
- Oh.
- Karina, this is Jenn.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.730
We were just talking
baby shower registry

33:19.765 --> 33:21.398
and I brought her
straight over here

33:21.433 --> 33:23.100
because you have all this stuff.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.235
I mean, all this great stuff.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.270
I wouldn't know what to call it.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.239
I could've really used
this place when I had Dylan.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.941
Great to meet you, Jenn.
Congratulations.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.210
Thanks. And you, too.
Emma said you're new here.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.245
You know, it's been about
a year, but it's taken a million

33:35.280 --> 33:37.581
to get settled and to get
this place up and running.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.282
Well, you've done a great job

33:39.318 --> 33:41.084
and now you need
to get acquainted here.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.386
Do you hike?

33:42.488 --> 33:45.389
Yes, I do, but I am
more inclined to do so

33:45.491 --> 33:47.290
if it's followed by a brunch.

33:47.326 --> 33:50.227
- What did I tell you?
- She's gonna fit right in.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.796
[gasps]
Oh.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.598
So her husband does
all the wood stuff

33:54.633 --> 33:55.899
and she does all the dresses.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.934
You're kidding.. Wow!

33:57.970 --> 33:59.603
So talented.

33:59.638 --> 34:03.073
Idea. So I'm hosting
Jenn's baby shower.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.042
What do you think
if we have it here?

34:05.144 --> 34:07.244
I mean, we can move
all the middle stuff out

34:07.346 --> 34:09.212
and have the food over there.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.114
I mean, it would be
great exposure for you

34:11.150 --> 34:14.451
and you get to meet everyone.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.653
I love it.
You know, that sounds like fun.

34:16.688 --> 34:19.056
Just let me know
what I need to do to help.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.457
She said yes.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.592
- You don't mind?
- I love the idea.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.395
- That is amazing.
- Unique, right?

34:25.497 --> 34:27.764
I'm tired
of the same old shindig.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.767
[instrumental music]

34:37.009 --> 34:39.509
Since we're here,
um, we could actually

34:39.545 --> 34:42.879
do these things as parents,
you know?

34:42.915 --> 34:44.915
We could. Is it weird
that we don't have a kid?

34:45.017 --> 34:47.317
We're going through the motions.
It's so easy, we just..

34:47.352 --> 34:49.486
Speaking of that,
wait, wait. I have to go.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.922
I told Lena that I would go
check on Mallie's dress

34:52.024 --> 34:53.790
before the ceremony started.
Okay?

34:53.892 --> 34:55.492
Sounds good. Do you want me
to save you a seat?

34:55.527 --> 34:57.694
Yes, please. I'll be right back.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.300
[gasps]
Mallie, you look so beautiful!

35:03.402 --> 35:05.902
Are you excited
to read your book to everyone?

35:05.938 --> 35:08.805
(Mallie)
'Can I read Karina
my favorite part now?'

35:08.907 --> 35:13.376
Oh, honey, uh, you, you h-had
the book. You had it in the car.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.146
I had to carry my bag
with both hands.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.381
'And my dress is too tight.'

35:18.417 --> 35:21.618
N-no problem. I saw a couple
of copies at the front desk.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.855
I can watch Mallie
if you wanna go get it.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.857
- Okay. Are you sure?
- Of course.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.025
Okay, hon, remember,
you're my most precious thing

35:29.061 --> 35:30.894
in the world, okay?

35:32.264 --> 35:34.297
Turn around. Let me see.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.167
Uh-oh!
I know what the problem is.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.369
You've been doing some growing.

35:39.404 --> 35:41.204
I just knew what was happening.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.207
Mm-hmm. I'm just gonna stick
my hand right underneath here.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.209
- Okay?
- Okay.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.011
Oh, what's this? What happened?

35:48.113 --> 35:50.347
Oh, that's just my ugly spot.

35:50.449 --> 35:54.050
Honey, no part of you is ugly.

35:54.086 --> 35:57.454
The ugly goes away
when I keep the Band-Aid on it.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.890
Oh, I see.

35:59.925 --> 36:03.360
Band-Aids help things heal.
Does it hurt?

36:03.462 --> 36:06.429
No. It's been there
as long as I can remember

36:06.465 --> 36:08.031
that I forget.

36:08.133 --> 36:11.034
Like a birthmark or a freckle?

36:11.136 --> 36:14.004
No. Just a spot
that no one is supposed to see.

36:14.106 --> 36:16.473
That's why my mom puts
a Band-Aid on it.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.113
Hey.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.951
Every part of you is perfect,
okay?

36:27.986 --> 36:31.254
I don't want you hiding
any part of yourself.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.757
I think
what you're saying is true.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.660
Unless you're playing
hide and seek.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.996
[chuckles]
Mallie,
I think that you're right.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.299
Let's see
if we can fix this dress.

36:52.344 --> 36:55.212
And that's one of the things
I love about this book

36:55.314 --> 36:58.782
which I recommend to everyone
and even their dogs.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.650
[laughing]

37:00.686 --> 37:02.886
(Karina)
'And that is our last recipient'

37:02.988 --> 37:06.089
of Willow Elementary's
Eager Reader Award.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.424
Let's give them all a hand.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.426
[applauding]

37:10.696 --> 37:12.829
Okay, it's picture time.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.832
[dramatic music]

37:19.338 --> 37:21.238
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
where are you goin'?

37:21.340 --> 37:24.774
Don't you wanna get your picture
taken with the group?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.943
Where do you think
the picture will be?

37:27.045 --> 37:28.878
Maybe in the newspaper.

37:28.914 --> 37:32.048
For everyone to see? Even people
that don't live here?

37:32.084 --> 37:36.019
- Probably.
- Will our names be in there?

37:36.054 --> 37:38.622
Maybe.

37:38.724 --> 37:42.659
You know, I've always wanted
to be in the newspaper.

37:42.694 --> 37:45.095
Mom's not gonna like it, though.

37:45.197 --> 37:47.197
Why not?

37:47.232 --> 37:50.200
She doesn't like us
taking pictures.

37:50.235 --> 37:51.334
Oh.

37:53.071 --> 37:56.306
Well, we better not, then.

37:56.408 --> 37:59.509
Hey, how about I see
if I can still get your name in?

37:59.544 --> 38:01.378
- Would you like that?
- Yeah.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.579
- We're gonna take off.
- Oh.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.347
They're just gonna do a picture.
But..

38:09.788 --> 38:12.188
[intense music]

38:14.626 --> 38:17.994
<i> (Emma)</i>
<i> But let your kid take</i>
<i> a school picture, am I right?</i>

38:18.030 --> 38:19.129
(Karina)
'What do you mean?'

38:19.164 --> 38:20.864
Mallie doesn't do a picture day.

38:24.369 --> 38:25.435
[screams]

38:27.539 --> 38:29.606
(Karina)
'I called the police
they're on their way.'

38:35.047 --> 38:38.281
She, um, told me
her name used to be Emily.

38:38.383 --> 38:40.383
[laughs]
Really?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.489
Oh, what's this? What happened?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.958
Just a spot
that no one is supposed to see.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.364
[doorbell ringing]

38:57.703 --> 38:59.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.971
- Hi.
- Um..

39:02.074 --> 39:05.342
W-well, since you guys left
so quickly the other day

39:05.377 --> 39:08.044
uh, uh, Mallie didn't get
her book.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.214
- And I, I brought you this.
- Thanks.

39:16.254 --> 39:18.955
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

39:20.359 --> 39:23.159
[dramatic music]

39:23.195 --> 39:26.162
Emma came by my shop
the other day

39:26.198 --> 39:28.164
and, uh, she brought Jenn.

39:28.266 --> 39:31.134
She was just glowing,
it was really great, um..

39:31.269 --> 39:33.703
And they invited me on a hike
on Sunday.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.572
Have you ever went hiking
with them?

39:35.607 --> 39:37.440
No. Actually, I haven't.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.876
Just some things don't
make sense to get a sitter for.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.811
- So.. Thanks.
- There you go.

39:41.947 --> 39:45.348
Um, Ryan and I are happy
to watch Mallie for you

39:45.450 --> 39:48.051
any evening
that you wanna go out.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.519
We're, uh, we're okay.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.157
Lena, about the group photo
yesterday..

39:54.292 --> 39:56.359
Are we okay?

39:56.461 --> 40:00.764
Uh, sure. I just, I mean, uh..

40:00.799 --> 40:02.599
Sorry, I was..

40:03.468 --> 40:04.634
What?

40:08.607 --> 40:09.939
You know, I, uh..

40:11.777 --> 40:16.212
Mallie wouldn't take
her medal off.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.714
You must be so proud.

40:17.816 --> 40:21.951
She's a good kid. I'm lucky.

40:21.987 --> 40:25.288
Do you...ever wish

40:25.323 --> 40:27.257
that her dad
was still in the picture?

40:27.292 --> 40:29.359
No, we're..

40:30.295 --> 40:31.895
We're fine on our own.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.265
Do you mind me asking
what happened?

40:35.300 --> 40:36.800
[chuckles]

40:36.835 --> 40:40.503
Well, there's really
nothing to share.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.839
We, uh..

40:44.176 --> 40:45.809
We just moved forward.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.581
Why don't you let her
take a picture, Lena?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.716
Why don't you stay out of this?

40:56.021 --> 40:58.254
I'm just concerned.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.757
You know, if you are hiding
from something

41:00.792 --> 41:02.158
you can let me know. I--

41:02.194 --> 41:04.727
Excuse me?

41:04.863 --> 41:06.996
How dare you suggest
I'm hiding something?

41:07.032 --> 41:08.998
- I didn't say that.
- No?

41:10.335 --> 41:11.935
You're not a parent.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.840
You could do me a favor.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.676
Stop trying to parent my child.
Okay?

41:19.711 --> 41:21.511
That's not what I'm doing.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.580
- No?
- No, I am concerned.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.983
- Mallie has told me something--
- Mallie is a child.

41:27.018 --> 41:30.987
You have, you don't have any
business talking to a child

41:31.022 --> 41:32.722
without their parent there.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.392
I mean, she is a kid.

41:38.563 --> 41:40.430
Kids say things..

41:41.500 --> 41:43.099
I mean, come on.

41:43.235 --> 41:45.201
Especially kids
who read a lot of books.

41:45.237 --> 41:46.870
- I mean..
- I know.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.506
And I am not a parent

41:49.541 --> 41:52.208
and I have no idea
what you've been through.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.511
But I want you to know

41:54.546 --> 41:56.779
that I am here if you need me.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.549
What I need right now..

42:01.720 --> 42:03.286
...is for you to leave.

42:05.390 --> 42:08.391
[intense music]

[dramatic music]

42:52.938 --> 42:54.604
Are you Karina Harlow?

42:54.639 --> 42:56.739
I am.

42:56.775 --> 42:58.808
Uh, come in.

43:04.649 --> 43:07.250
We were visited
by a Lena Colbert.

43:07.285 --> 43:10.853
- Do you know her?
- I do.

43:10.989 --> 43:12.522
Well, Ms. Colbert's requested

43:12.624 --> 43:14.857
to file a restraining order
against you.

43:14.993 --> 43:16.826
Why? What did I do?

43:16.861 --> 43:18.461
'According to Ms. Colbert,
there's been'

43:18.496 --> 43:21.030
some inappropriate behavior
regarding her daughter.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.666
Like what? That's crazy.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.936
Did you tell her that
her daughter was taken by a man

43:26.972 --> 43:28.371
while the child
was in your care?

43:28.506 --> 43:29.439
Well, yes.

43:29.474 --> 43:31.140
'Were you outside of her home'

43:31.176 --> 43:32.809
'when you thought
you saw a man enter'

43:32.844 --> 43:33.810
'and you took it upon yourself'

43:33.845 --> 43:35.945
to call the police?

43:35.981 --> 43:38.314
'Did you gift her daughter
with several items'

43:38.350 --> 43:40.149
'including a custom-made dress'

43:40.185 --> 43:41.985
'that you later
made alterations to'

43:42.020 --> 43:45.421
while it was on the child,
with no other adults present?

43:45.523 --> 43:46.923
That's not how it happened.

43:47.025 --> 43:48.625
That's not
how it happened at all.

43:48.660 --> 43:51.227
This is not right.

43:51.363 --> 43:53.630
Ms. Colbert
is feeling very uncomfortable

43:53.665 --> 43:54.998
with the multiple
false scenarios

43:55.033 --> 43:56.899
that you've created
and embellished on

43:57.035 --> 43:59.068
with no actual evidence
that they've occurred.

43:59.204 --> 44:00.770
I didn't make any of this up.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.505
Well, you've attempted
to involve the authorities

44:02.540 --> 44:04.974
on more than one occasion,
all of which Ms. Colbert feels

44:05.010 --> 44:07.510
'are the product
of delusional paranoia.'

44:07.545 --> 44:09.679
'Now her daughter has expressed
discomfort as well.'

44:09.714 --> 44:11.581
Did you even talk to Mallie?

44:11.716 --> 44:13.416
If we do go through
with serving you

44:13.551 --> 44:15.318
you'd have to appear in court.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.020
I know that might not be
the best thing

44:17.055 --> 44:18.621
for a business
that caters to minors

44:18.657 --> 44:21.224
so she has agreed
to a polite warning.

44:21.259 --> 44:23.026
She's not right.

44:23.061 --> 44:24.994
You have to talk to her
about her daughter.

44:25.030 --> 44:26.462
- She is hiding something.
- Ms. Harlow.

44:26.564 --> 44:28.364
If I have
to speak with you again

44:28.400 --> 44:31.267
it'll be in regard
to a court-ordered appearance.

44:32.237 --> 44:34.137
Respect her wishes.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.706
Have a good day.

44:42.914 --> 44:44.380
Is everything alright?

44:46.251 --> 44:47.283
No.

44:48.253 --> 44:49.986
Should I be worried?

44:52.090 --> 44:56.292
Lena's trying
to cast suspicion on me

44:56.394 --> 44:59.062
so they don't suspect her.

44:59.097 --> 45:00.897
(Lena)
'I know I have a tendency
to keep to myself'

45:00.932 --> 45:03.900
and I hope it doesn't insult you
or your efforts to include me.

45:03.935 --> 45:07.236
It's just,
being a single parent is..

45:07.272 --> 45:09.238
[sighs]
...it's hard.

45:09.274 --> 45:12.141
Of course. We're here
if you ever need a hand.

45:12.277 --> 45:15.344
Actually, that's why I wanted
to, um, talk with you guys and..

45:15.447 --> 45:19.148
I don't wanna start
any problems or..

45:19.284 --> 45:22.885
But Mallie has, has said
some things to me

45:22.921 --> 45:26.756
and I just,
I can't, I can't ignore it.

45:26.791 --> 45:30.193
[sighs]
Mallie has shared
that there have been some things

45:30.228 --> 45:33.396
that have made her
uncomfortable.

45:33.431 --> 45:36.065
And again, I don't, I don't
want to jump to any conclusions

45:36.101 --> 45:38.868
or cast anyone in a bad light

45:38.903 --> 45:42.672
but, you know,
she's, she's my kid.

45:42.774 --> 45:44.807
Of course. What happened?

45:48.146 --> 45:49.779
It's Karina.

45:52.117 --> 45:54.183
I would
really appreciate your help

45:54.319 --> 45:57.520
in ensuring Karina
keeps her distance from Mallie.

45:57.655 --> 45:59.055
Did she do something to Mallie?

45:59.157 --> 46:03.593
She can be a little aggressive

46:03.628 --> 46:06.028
in her urges to parent my child.

46:06.164 --> 46:08.297
And I just..

46:08.333 --> 46:10.733
I feel a line has been crossed.

46:10.769 --> 46:13.469
T-thank you.
I-I'm sure this wasn't easy.

46:13.505 --> 46:16.305
I just, I felt as a parent..

46:16.341 --> 46:18.908
...you had a right to know.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.443
You have our support.

46:20.478 --> 46:22.912
[cell phone ringing]

46:22.947 --> 46:25.481
It's Karina.

46:25.517 --> 46:27.817
- That's uncomfortable.
- Right?

46:30.188 --> 46:31.721
[sighs]

46:31.856 --> 46:33.790
It's so sad.

46:33.825 --> 46:38.394
This couple that has a business
that caters to children..

46:38.530 --> 46:40.463
...they can't have a child
of their own.

46:40.498 --> 46:42.031
Just breaks my heart.

46:57.549 --> 47:00.983
Hey, so I don't want
to alarm you or anything

47:01.019 --> 47:04.387
but there's been a man
hanging around here.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.889
Uh, he was in a blue Jeep and..

47:08.426 --> 47:10.326
Just keep a close eye on her.

47:13.898 --> 47:15.131
Are you kidding?

47:17.602 --> 47:22.138
I had Maya the same month
that little Emily went missing.

47:22.273 --> 47:24.040
We flew out of Copeland County

47:24.075 --> 47:26.843
as soon as I recovered
from my C-section.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.911
I'll never shake that.

47:30.215 --> 47:31.714
Emily?

47:31.749 --> 47:34.083
That little girl
that was kidnapped.

47:34.118 --> 47:35.985
About five years ago.

47:37.589 --> 47:39.689
What a nightmare.

47:39.791 --> 47:41.490
[sighs]

47:44.262 --> 47:45.528
Have a good one.

47:53.271 --> 47:54.837
(man on video)
'Please, we beg you.'

47:56.774 --> 47:58.541
'Return our little girl.'

48:00.111 --> 48:03.079
[woman sobbing]

48:03.114 --> 48:07.783
If anyone has seen anything
or knows any information..

48:10.288 --> 48:12.188
'...please..'

48:12.323 --> 48:15.958
She has a birthmark.
Right here.

48:20.465 --> 48:23.633
Tragedy strikes
in Copeland County this morning

48:23.668 --> 48:26.269
as a married couple
was killed in a car crash

48:26.304 --> 48:28.771
just south of the I-45 bridge.

48:28.806 --> 48:32.108
Lacy and Tom Worthington
were on their way to the airport

48:32.143 --> 48:33.609
at around 6.30 a.m.

48:33.645 --> 48:35.978
says the Copeland County
sheriff's office

48:36.014 --> 48:39.248
when their vehicle lost control
and flipped upside down.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.584
'The couple was killed
instantly.'

48:41.619 --> 48:43.986
'This news comes
almost two years after'

48:44.022 --> 48:46.722
'the late couple's daughter
was abducted from their home.'

48:46.858 --> 48:50.259
Tom and Lacy leave
no surviving family.

48:50.361 --> 48:52.128
'But friends mourning
at the crash site say'

48:52.163 --> 48:54.897
'they were inspired by
the couple's tireless search..'

48:59.037 --> 49:01.570
Ryan, you have to see this.

49:01.673 --> 49:03.873
This Emily Worthington
would be nearly eight

49:03.908 --> 49:06.075
and Mallie
is nearly eight as well.

49:06.210 --> 49:08.010
And they're both
blonde-haired, blue-eyed.

49:08.046 --> 49:11.314
I hate to say it, but so are
most of the other little girls

49:11.349 --> 49:14.850
that go missing, and Emily
is a pretty common name.

49:14.886 --> 49:17.019
And what about the car crash?

49:18.189 --> 49:21.190
[intense music]

49:22.894 --> 49:27.463
But this girl was taken right
out from under her mom's nose.

49:27.498 --> 49:30.366
Right from her bedroom
in Copeland County.

49:31.235 --> 49:33.135
And she has a birthmark.

49:33.237 --> 49:36.639
- Who? Mallie or Emily?
- Both.

49:36.674 --> 49:38.808
Mallie has a spot
on her shoulder

49:38.843 --> 49:40.543
that Lena makes her cover
with a Band-Aid

49:40.578 --> 49:43.446
and Emily had one
on the back of her shoulder

49:43.548 --> 49:45.114
in the same area.

49:48.219 --> 49:50.720
Well, could Mallie have
heard this story somewhere

49:50.755 --> 49:52.788
and just kinda made it her own?

49:52.924 --> 49:56.258
I don't think so. She was three
when this happened.

49:59.263 --> 50:01.864
Wow, I don't know.

50:01.899 --> 50:03.899
You're gonna have
to talk to Lena about this.

50:03.935 --> 50:05.334
Well, if I ask
too many questions

50:05.436 --> 50:07.536
she just might pick up
and disappear with Mallie

50:07.572 --> 50:09.238
somewhere untraceable.

50:12.276 --> 50:13.843
Well, once you make
an accusation like this

50:13.945 --> 50:15.578
you can't come back from it.

50:15.613 --> 50:18.781
Start with Lena before you do
or say anything to anyone.

50:18.816 --> 50:20.783
I just have to do right
by Mallie, you know

50:20.818 --> 50:23.586
and she doesn't want me
anywhere near them.

50:23.621 --> 50:26.255
And now I know why.

50:26.290 --> 50:28.290
[cell phone vibrating]

50:29.460 --> 50:31.594
Hey, Jenn, what's going on?

50:31.629 --> 50:34.830
Hey there, so I really
appreciate you offering

50:34.966 --> 50:38.734
to host the shower, it's just,
the more I think about it

50:38.770 --> 50:40.803
I'm starting to feel like
a hot-air balloon

50:40.838 --> 50:43.906
and I think I just wanna
keep it intimate and easy.

50:43.941 --> 50:45.574
Yeah, of course.

50:45.610 --> 50:47.910
Yeah, We're just gonna do it
at my house with family

50:47.945 --> 50:51.247
and a few close friends.
I don't want a fuss.

50:51.282 --> 50:52.948
I totally understand.

50:52.984 --> 50:54.917
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help.

50:54.952 --> 50:57.386
(Jenn)
'Thanks. You take care.'

50:57.488 --> 50:58.788
You, too.

51:02.126 --> 51:06.262
Lena's already going
after, uh, my new friends.

51:06.297 --> 51:07.797
What do you mean?

51:07.832 --> 51:10.266
The friends that I just made,
they're pulling away.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.735
I'm not backing down.

51:12.837 --> 51:15.404
Okay, I support that

51:15.506 --> 51:18.240
but she's actively going ahead
of you to discredit you.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.942
Are you really up
for that kind of a fight?

51:19.977 --> 51:22.278
I have to do right by Mallie

51:22.313 --> 51:24.680
even if it costs me
my reputation.

51:27.618 --> 51:29.885
Maybe go around Lena.

51:30.021 --> 51:32.755
You know, enlist the help of
someone who isn't in the circle.

51:35.693 --> 51:36.759
You're right.

51:40.331 --> 51:43.666
<i> (Karina)</i>
<i> Hey, Cam, can you meet me?</i>
<i> It's urgent.</i>

51:43.701 --> 51:45.801
(Karina)
'I'm just trying to figure out
why she would wanna'

51:45.837 --> 51:47.403
keep this burglary quiet.

51:47.505 --> 51:49.672
I mean, I would wanna
get this guy, right?

51:49.707 --> 51:52.274
Well, by the sound of the
bleeding, I mean, she got him.

51:52.376 --> 51:54.043
Maybe that's the reason why.

51:54.712 --> 51:56.345
Maybe.

51:56.380 --> 51:58.514
And I went to the local library
to find out what I could

51:58.549 --> 52:00.449
on Emily Worthington case.

52:00.551 --> 52:02.184
There wasn't much,
she's from a small town

52:02.220 --> 52:04.787
there wasn't
a lot of coverage on it, but..

52:06.891 --> 52:09.625
...I found this picture of her.

52:09.727 --> 52:12.261
This is her, this is Mallie.

52:14.899 --> 52:17.700
That's quite
a striking resemblance.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.802
You know what, can you send that
to me for reference?

52:19.837 --> 52:22.838
Of course, of course.

52:22.874 --> 52:26.142
And would you mind presenting
this to the authorities?

52:26.244 --> 52:27.443
I just don't think
that they would take me

52:27.578 --> 52:28.544
seriously right now.

52:28.579 --> 52:30.045
Absolutely.

52:31.415 --> 52:32.615
(Emma)
Karina?

52:37.388 --> 52:39.221
Sorry to interrupt.

52:39.257 --> 52:40.990
I just wanted to say
thanks again

52:41.092 --> 52:43.459
for your offer
for Jenn's shower, but..

52:43.561 --> 52:46.095
I know. Jenn called me.

52:47.565 --> 52:49.398
Well, I'll see you around.

52:55.907 --> 52:58.507
(Emma on phone)
'Karina was having lunch
with some woman'

52:58.609 --> 53:00.543
'showing her a picture
of Mallie.'

53:00.578 --> 53:03.812
'It was so strange, when I came
over, she hid the picture.'

she was up to something'

55:42.740 --> 55:46.709
I'm sorry, I-I just felt like
I took too much of a break today

55:46.744 --> 55:48.677
and I need to catch up.

55:48.813 --> 55:50.746
I left you some food
on the counter.

55:50.781 --> 55:54.550
Aw, thanks.
I'll be home in a bit.

'Well, I'll try
to wait up for you.'

snuggle into bed next to you.

Hey.

- Hey.
- Hey.

56:34.291 --> 56:36.091
Um..

56:36.127 --> 56:37.259
Help me get this out.

56:37.294 --> 56:39.294
- No, sweetie.
- We have to go.

56:39.330 --> 56:42.197
No, no, the doctor said
if you hadn't turned your head

56:42.299 --> 56:43.932
when you did,
this could have been fatal.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.601
I'm fine, I promise.
We have to go.

56:45.636 --> 56:48.270
Honey, no.

56:48.305 --> 56:50.105
The police think
that this was a robbery.

56:50.207 --> 56:53.776
It was not a robbery,
Ryan, please.

56:53.811 --> 56:57.279
Honey, Look at me. Look at me.

56:57.314 --> 56:58.947
This was a really close call.

56:58.983 --> 57:02.017
You've been in some really
dangerous situations lately.

57:02.052 --> 57:04.319
Okay, it's time
to take a step back.

57:06.223 --> 57:07.156
Please.

Yes, this is she.

57:23.073 --> 57:24.807
Oh, my gosh.

please come to reception?'

I'm so sorry.

Karina.

57:50.367 --> 57:51.767
I couldn't protect her.

57:52.937 --> 57:54.703
I can't even protect myself.

57:54.738 --> 57:57.139
Hey, you couldn't
even if you wanted to.

57:57.274 --> 58:00.209
How am I gonna protect Mallie?

58:00.244 --> 58:02.411
Okay, these incidents

58:02.446 --> 58:04.646
they are unfortunate,
but they are unrelated.

58:04.782 --> 58:07.382
Do you honestly believe that?

58:07.418 --> 58:09.184
Because I'm not gonna
be able to forgive myself

58:09.220 --> 58:11.053
if I don't do something.

58:11.088 --> 58:13.589
Okay, that may be,
but you shouldn't do anything

58:13.624 --> 58:14.890
without the help
of the authorities.

58:14.925 --> 58:17.392
They're not going
to listen to me or you.

58:17.428 --> 58:19.228
We have to push forward.

58:19.263 --> 58:22.698
We can't handle this, we're not
equipped, we need their help.

58:22.733 --> 58:26.368
The police think
that I'm a danger to Mallie.

58:26.403 --> 58:27.436
They've already threatened
to slapped me

58:27.471 --> 58:29.004
with a restraining order.

58:29.073 --> 58:32.140
Why would we waste our energy
trying to convince them

58:32.243 --> 58:34.843
that they're wrong when
we can use that to help Mallie?

58:34.979 --> 58:37.012
Sweetie, you're upset.

58:37.114 --> 58:39.848
Okay, I know this is very
difficult to see Cam like this

58:39.984 --> 58:42.384
but, sweetie, please,
I need you to think clearly.

58:42.419 --> 58:45.654
Is that really, really
the best choice of action?

58:46.624 --> 58:47.589
[scoffs]

58:47.625 --> 58:49.658
[indistinct announcement on PA]

58:52.162 --> 58:54.363
Lena's not well. I know it.

58:54.498 --> 58:57.533
And if she's mentally unstable,
then she needs to get help.

58:57.668 --> 59:01.370
We have to think about Mallie
here, someone has to

59:01.438 --> 59:03.305
because if Mallie is Emily

59:03.340 --> 59:05.974
then we have to be sure,
you know?

59:06.010 --> 59:08.477
I mean, one day
we might have a Mallie

59:08.512 --> 59:10.279
and if she's in trouble,
wouldn't we want someone

59:10.314 --> 59:12.314
to do everything that they can
to help her?

59:12.349 --> 59:15.384
Okay, okay, I just think
we're entering territory here

59:15.519 --> 59:17.052
neither of us
know how to navigate.

59:17.187 --> 59:19.121
I know that you're scared,
I'm too, but we have--

59:19.156 --> 59:20.956
Do what, exactly?

59:23.627 --> 59:25.394
The man that tried
to take Mallie

59:25.529 --> 59:28.130
or the person that was
at their house that night

59:28.165 --> 59:31.233
they may have been involved
in the Emily kidnapping

59:31.368 --> 59:32.834
or they can know
something about Lena.

59:32.870 --> 59:35.170
Okay, I don't want you
doing that alone.

59:35.205 --> 59:37.739
I can start by reviewing
the security-cam footage

59:37.875 --> 59:39.775
from the day
that Mallie was almost taken.

59:39.810 --> 59:42.177
Maybe I can ID him or his car--

59:42.212 --> 59:43.645
Karina.

59:46.317 --> 59:49.117
And I won't do anything else
without you.

59:50.854 --> 59:53.655
Now can we please
get me cleared to leave here?

1:00:03.233 --> 1:00:04.833
(woman on phone)
'One minute please, ma'am.'

1:00:12.576 --> 1:00:16.211
That's why I'm so surprised
he didn't report it. I..

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:20.015
My son said that he scraped
the side of the car pretty bad.

1:00:20.050 --> 1:00:21.350
The poor man's probably worried

1:00:21.385 --> 1:00:23.452
about how much
this is gonna cost him.

1:00:25.856 --> 1:00:29.491
That's exactly why
I wish he had left a note and..

1:00:31.362 --> 1:00:35.631
I'm just trying to teach my son
responsibility for his actions

1:00:35.766 --> 1:00:37.132
that's why I want him
to call the man

1:00:37.267 --> 1:00:40.268
and properly report the damage
and apologize.

1:00:41.238 --> 1:00:44.006
Can you get me a number?

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:46.975
(woman on phone)
'I found a similar Jeep
under an Ivan Serling.'

1:00:52.249 --> 1:00:53.649
Ivan Serling.

1:00:55.219 --> 1:00:56.818
(Ivan)
I know she's dangerous.

1:00:56.887 --> 1:00:59.087
I was trying to get Mallie
away from her.

1:00:59.123 --> 1:01:00.989
I thought you were trying
to kidnap her.

1:01:01.125 --> 1:01:02.691
No, I understand that
in retrospect

1:01:02.726 --> 1:01:06.728
but you don't know my wife
like I do.

1:01:06.764 --> 1:01:09.598
- I had to take the chance.
- Lena's your wife?

1:01:09.633 --> 1:01:13.669
Technically, yeah,
but I haven't seen her in years.

1:01:13.737 --> 1:01:16.004
For the last week, like I said,
I've been tracking her

1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:18.707
to try to save Mallie from her.

1:01:18.809 --> 1:01:20.842
How long have you been
tracking her?

1:01:20.978 --> 1:01:23.011
Oh, her real name
is Isabelle Redder.

1:01:23.147 --> 1:01:27.182
I searched every county court
in the state for her name change

1:01:27.251 --> 1:01:31.053
and a few weeks ago
I finally got lucky.

1:01:31.088 --> 1:01:32.788
And it was here.

1:01:32.823 --> 1:01:36.925
One day I saw her,
but she was with a little girl.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:40.562
For a brief second,
I lost it, I thought

1:01:40.597 --> 1:01:45.133
"What if
that little girl was mine?"

1:01:45.169 --> 1:01:47.703
You know, m-maybe she didn't
wanna raise a child with me

1:01:47.838 --> 1:01:50.105
and so she tried to kill me..

1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:53.742
Then I came to my senses and I-I
realized w-what's bothering me

1:01:53.777 --> 1:01:55.977
is that she looks so familiar

1:01:56.013 --> 1:01:57.913
and not because
she may be my daughter.

1:01:57.948 --> 1:02:00.816
A few days before she left me

1:02:00.851 --> 1:02:05.020
we went by this park and..

1:02:05.122 --> 1:02:08.290
...she was fixed
on this little blonde girl

1:02:08.325 --> 1:02:10.826
about three years old.

1:02:10.861 --> 1:02:14.229
Said it reminded her
of her littler Abby, you know

1:02:14.364 --> 1:02:16.364
the one who was taken from her.

1:02:17.634 --> 1:02:19.167
Where were you living
at the time?

1:02:19.203 --> 1:02:20.869
Copeland County.

1:02:22.506 --> 1:02:24.005
I think that toddler
might be Mallie.

1:02:24.041 --> 1:02:27.743
I knew she was violent.
But kidnapping?

1:02:27.878 --> 1:02:30.579
I never thought that she'd be
capable of such a thing.

1:02:30.714 --> 1:02:32.380
But I-I..

1:02:33.650 --> 1:02:35.383
I don't know anymore.

1:02:37.855 --> 1:02:39.154
You should try to understand

1:02:39.189 --> 1:02:41.823
that Lena wasn't always
this way.

1:02:41.859 --> 1:02:44.793
It's because of what happened
to her when she was a child.

1:02:44.895 --> 1:02:47.863
Isabelle, or Lena

1:02:47.898 --> 1:02:50.098
gave birth at 16

1:02:50.234 --> 1:02:53.168
but Lena's doctor diagnosed her
as having a mental illness

1:02:53.203 --> 1:02:55.937
<i> and that meant</i>
<i> she was incapable</i>

1:02:56.073 --> 1:02:58.974
<i> of safely raising a child.</i>

1:02:59.076 --> 1:03:02.811
<i> (Ivan)</i>
<i> She refused to give</i>
<i> that baby up for adoption.</i>

1:03:02.846 --> 1:03:05.514
<i> She ran away with the baby.</i>

1:03:05.549 --> 1:03:10.018
<i> Her doctor told the Department</i>
<i>Of Children And Family Services</i>

1:03:10.053 --> 1:03:12.187
<i> who came and took the child</i>
<i> from Lena.</i>

1:03:17.094 --> 1:03:18.827
This was your child as well?

1:03:18.862 --> 1:03:23.331
No, no, this was years before
I met Isabelle.

1:03:23.367 --> 1:03:26.535
Her daughter
is in her twenties by now

1:03:26.570 --> 1:03:29.905
raised by a, a loving family,
we're told.

1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:31.873
You need to tell the police
what really happened.

1:03:31.909 --> 1:03:34.376
What's the point?
They won't believe me.

1:03:39.216 --> 1:03:41.049
She's too dangerous.

1:03:42.886 --> 1:03:44.920
(Ivan)
'Who knows what could happen?'

1:03:44.955 --> 1:03:47.122
'And think about
what she can do to Mallie.'

And if you all don't mind,
I would love for you guys

1:05:08.372 --> 1:05:11.139
to try my newest recipe.

It only takes a few moments
for the magic powers to mix it.

1:05:15.746 --> 1:05:18.113
Abracadabra.

1:05:18.181 --> 1:05:19.748
(Lena)
'Mallie, come on,
it's time to go.'

1:05:19.850 --> 1:05:22.617
- But I have guests.
- Don't argue with me.

1:05:22.686 --> 1:05:25.120
- Five more minutes?
- Say goodbye to your friends.

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:28.189
- Now.
- Okay.

1:05:28.225 --> 1:05:30.892
Psst. Mallie.

1:05:30.928 --> 1:05:32.794
- Karina.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:05:32.930 --> 1:05:34.896
[shushing]

1:05:34.932 --> 1:05:37.465
You came just in time for tea.

1:05:37.601 --> 1:05:41.336
- I'm so lucky.
- Come in the yard.

1:05:41.438 --> 1:05:43.705
Actually, I was wondering

1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:46.374
if, uh, you wanna come with me.

1:05:46.410 --> 1:05:50.011
If I come with you,
can I at least have a tea party?

1:05:50.047 --> 1:05:51.746
Of course, sweetie,
of course, you can

1:05:51.782 --> 1:05:54.516
but you can only come
if you feel comfortable.

1:05:54.618 --> 1:05:57.686
I think maybe I would like
to go to your house.

1:05:57.721 --> 1:05:59.788
Okay, great. Come on, let's go.

1:06:11.435 --> 1:06:13.101
(Mallie)
'Are you going on a trip?'

1:06:13.136 --> 1:06:17.005
No, actually, we-we're
kind of on a trip right now.

1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:18.606
This is my best friend's house

1:06:18.642 --> 1:06:22.444
and she's not here,
so we're watching it for her.

1:06:22.479 --> 1:06:24.846
So it's kinda like
having two houses.

1:06:24.982 --> 1:06:26.448
Fun, huh?

1:06:26.483 --> 1:06:30.385
Yeah. Karina,
I need to use the restroom.

1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:32.554
Okay, go ahead,
it's right in there.

1:06:36.994 --> 1:06:38.293
What if Lena goes to the cops?

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:39.694
She wouldn't risk it
a second time.

1:06:39.830 --> 1:06:40.862
How can you be sure?

1:06:40.998 --> 1:06:42.731
How can she report
her child missing

1:06:42.766 --> 1:06:45.200
if her child
is actually a missing child?

1:06:47.004 --> 1:06:50.305
Okay, the way we're going
about this, it looks really bad.

1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:52.307
Like, we're taking
a child as well.

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:54.576
What? We didn't have a choice.

1:06:54.611 --> 1:06:56.478
She was gonna leave with Mallie.

1:06:56.513 --> 1:06:59.214
We were never gonna
see her again.

1:06:59.282 --> 1:07:01.282
Mallie is Emily.

1:07:01.318 --> 1:07:03.318
No one's gonna care
how we prove it.

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:05.420
And how are we gonna prove that?

1:07:05.522 --> 1:07:06.988
Well, Lena attacked me
at the store.

1:07:07.024 --> 1:07:08.823
I can go and get
the video surveillance of it.

1:07:08.859 --> 1:07:10.492
Wait, Lena attacked you
at the sore?

1:07:10.527 --> 1:07:12.927
Ryan!

1:07:12.963 --> 1:07:16.197
You promised me
that you would do this.

1:07:17.034 --> 1:07:18.566
Please.

1:07:20.370 --> 1:07:22.470
- Right, I'm going with you.
- No.

1:07:22.506 --> 1:07:25.874
Mallie, hey,
can you do me a huge favor

1:07:25.976 --> 1:07:27.509
and, uh, take care of Ryan?

1:07:27.544 --> 1:07:28.910
'Cause I gotta leave
for a little bit.

1:07:29.046 --> 1:07:30.478
Oh, sure.

1:07:30.514 --> 1:07:33.381
I think he might need
a hair cut.

1:07:34.684 --> 1:07:36.418
I think you're right.

1:07:41.391 --> 1:07:44.292
Sit right down here, sir.

1:07:44.394 --> 1:07:46.895

Okay.

1:07:52.569 --> 1:07:54.035
[laughs]

1:07:54.071 --> 1:07:57.138
So where did you learn
how to do this?

1:07:57.174 --> 1:08:00.975
Some things people
just have a natural talent for.

1:08:01.011 --> 1:08:03.144
Well, you are very talented
at it.

1:08:06.516 --> 1:08:08.616
I miss my daddy.

1:08:10.887 --> 1:08:12.087
Yeah?

1:08:15.192 --> 1:08:17.158

He's stable, but it's best
we keep him overnight.

The doctors would wanna
run some tests.

1:09:54.124 --> 1:09:56.724
Uh, we've notified the police,
so expect a call.

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.159
Get some sleep and you can
visit him in the morning.

1:09:58.295 --> 1:10:00.094
Okay, let me know
if anything changes

1:10:00.130 --> 1:10:01.663
and I'll come right over.

1:10:02.465 --> 1:10:03.998
We will.

1:10:04.134 --> 1:10:06.534

'My sister and my niece
are staying with you.'

I was wondering
if you could tell me

1:11:32.555 --> 1:11:33.588
if they've checked in yet.

she's got blonde hair and..

Yes, I understand that
information is private, but..

1:11:45.001 --> 1:11:47.602
I understand, I understand,
I was just wondering if I could

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:49.337
give you the make and model
of their car

1:11:49.372 --> 1:11:51.339
and you can tell me
if you've seen it?

1:11:53.410 --> 1:11:55.343
Can you tell me
if our car is still there?

1:11:55.378 --> 1:11:58.413
I-I, I just don't know if she's
left to come pick me up yet..

is 3-D-H, that's all I know.

though. It..

Well, um, th-thanks so much, um.

and she was, like, in the shower

1:12:15.265 --> 1:12:18.099

1:14:33.069 --> 1:14:35.236
(Lena)
'Oh, I'll tell you what, let me
find somewhere to pull over'

1:14:35.338 --> 1:14:36.737
'and I'll tuck you in
so you could get some sleep.'

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:38.139
'Is that okay?'

1:14:44.714 --> 1:14:45.813
Ivan.

1:14:47.083 --> 1:14:48.416
I need your help.

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:58.125
[cell phone vibrating]

1:15:03.032 --> 1:15:04.866
Isabelle Redder?

1:15:09.105 --> 1:15:10.972
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

1:15:11.107 --> 1:15:12.640
(Karina on phone)
'I know it's you, Isabelle.'

1:15:12.709 --> 1:15:14.709
'I'm sorry about Abby.'

1:15:14.744 --> 1:15:18.880
I'm sorry they took her
from you. And I want to help.

1:15:18.915 --> 1:15:21.182
- Please let me help.
- Stay out of this, Karina.

1:15:21.217 --> 1:15:24.085
You took Abby to the overlook
to see the city

1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:25.853
'and that's the last time
you saw her.'

1:15:25.889 --> 1:15:27.922
That.. That's not what happened.

1:15:27.957 --> 1:15:31.459
You wanted her
to see the lights.

1:15:31.561 --> 1:15:34.328
I bet you can't go there
without thinking about her.

1:15:40.570 --> 1:15:41.702
Lena?

1:15:47.610 --> 1:15:48.876
[engine starts]

1:16:07.163 --> 1:16:08.729
Hey there.

1:16:08.765 --> 1:16:10.364
Hardly any cars
have passed through.

1:16:10.433 --> 1:16:12.700
Well, we only need one.

1:16:12.835 --> 1:16:14.101
This was the spot.

1:16:15.271 --> 1:16:16.938
I took her here more than once

1:16:16.973 --> 1:16:20.708
and she would just sit here
staring at over the city

1:16:20.843 --> 1:16:22.877
whispering to herself.

1:16:23.012 --> 1:16:25.313
Thanks again for doing this.

1:16:25.348 --> 1:16:28.816
Listen, I'm gonna park my car
up there, out of sight.

1:16:28.851 --> 1:16:31.285
All I need for you to do is
to distract her long enough

1:16:31.321 --> 1:16:33.521
for me to grab Mallie. Okay?

1:16:34.691 --> 1:16:37.358
[engine revving]

1:16:40.997 --> 1:16:42.330
Anything?

1:16:42.365 --> 1:16:44.498
Not yet. Wait, wait..

1:16:45.668 --> 1:16:46.767
I do.

1:16:47.837 --> 1:16:49.470
It's a gray sedan.

1:16:49.505 --> 1:16:50.705
(Karina)
'That will be her.'

1:16:52.008 --> 1:16:54.175
Uh, what if she sees me
and bolts?

1:16:54.210 --> 1:16:56.077
Lay low
until she gets out of the car

1:16:56.179 --> 1:16:58.112
and then you approach her.

1:16:58.214 --> 1:16:59.880
'Can you see a little girl
with her?'

1:16:59.916 --> 1:17:03.317
No. Not from here.

1:17:03.353 --> 1:17:05.486
Keep me on speaker, okay?
Don't hang up.

1:17:05.521 --> 1:17:06.854
You got it.

1:17:09.859 --> 1:17:12.793
[intense music]

1:17:33.249 --> 1:17:36.684
You always loved to come up here
and look at the city lights.

1:17:40.890 --> 1:17:43.224
Don't think
I didn't expect to see you here.

1:17:44.627 --> 1:17:47.928
Isa, I have missed you.

1:17:47.964 --> 1:17:50.164
I know
you have missed her, but..

1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:52.733
...you have to stop running.

1:17:52.769 --> 1:17:54.268
Ivan.

1:17:55.772 --> 1:17:57.438
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

1:17:57.473 --> 1:18:00.207
I agree.

1:18:00.243 --> 1:18:03.844
- Look, let's just start fresh.
- She's not yours.

1:18:03.946 --> 1:18:07.048
- And I'm not giving her up.
- Who?

1:18:07.083 --> 1:18:09.750
[scoffs]
I'm not stupid, Ivan.

1:18:09.786 --> 1:18:11.552
Is there someone in the car
with you?

1:18:11.587 --> 1:18:16.190
If there were, do you really
think I would let you near her?

1:18:16.292 --> 1:18:18.025
We can be a family.

1:18:18.127 --> 1:18:20.961
I'm not falling for this, Ivan.

1:18:20.997 --> 1:18:23.564
[dramatic music]

1:18:25.134 --> 1:18:27.802
What, you, you surprised?

1:18:27.837 --> 1:18:30.971
- Look, you are not gonna--
- Oh, I am.

1:18:31.007 --> 1:18:33.207
- Because I have to.
- Put the gun down.

1:18:33.309 --> 1:18:35.910
You know why? Because you will
never stop looking.

1:18:35.945 --> 1:18:38.312
Please put the gun down.

1:18:38.347 --> 1:18:41.415
- She will never stop looking.
- Please.

1:18:41.451 --> 1:18:43.250
It's over, Ivan.

1:18:44.487 --> 1:18:46.153
Lena! No!

1:18:46.189 --> 1:18:47.321
[gunshot]

1:18:49.125 --> 1:18:51.225
[groans]
God..

1:18:54.997 --> 1:18:56.831
Help! Help!

1:18:56.866 --> 1:18:59.400
- Karina!
- Help!

1:18:59.502 --> 1:19:02.103
Ivan! Ivan?

1:19:02.138 --> 1:19:04.538
- Can you hear me? Are you okay?
- 'No.'

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.074
(Ivan on phone)
'No, I'm not. I'm not.
I'm shot.'

1:19:10.346 --> 1:19:11.746
Karina?

1:19:16.853 --> 1:19:18.419
You're something else.

1:19:20.056 --> 1:19:22.623
I trusted you.

1:19:22.658 --> 1:19:24.925
I let you into our home

1:19:25.027 --> 1:19:27.628
'into our lives.'

1:19:27.663 --> 1:19:29.964
This is about
what's right for Mallie.

1:19:29.999 --> 1:19:32.500
This is what's best for Mallie.

1:19:34.670 --> 1:19:36.203
[grunting]

1:19:36.239 --> 1:19:37.538
It is not what's best
for Mallie.

1:19:37.573 --> 1:19:39.440
You don't know
what's best for her.

1:19:39.542 --> 1:19:41.675
- I'm her mother!
- It's not! You're dangerous!

1:19:41.711 --> 1:19:44.245
- She's not safe!
- She is safe with me!

1:19:44.347 --> 1:19:46.680
- I'm her mother!
- Ah!

1:19:47.550 --> 1:19:49.183
What?

1:19:49.218 --> 1:19:51.719
You didn't uncover that
in your research?

1:19:51.754 --> 1:19:54.622
Huh? Yeah,
that's 'cause I'm good.

1:19:54.724 --> 1:19:56.357
And I'm an even better mother

1:19:56.392 --> 1:19:58.759
'and I will do anything
for my Mallie.'

1:19:58.861 --> 1:19:59.894
[grunts]

1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:08.002
- '911. What's your emergency?'
- 'Hello. I need help.'

1:20:08.037 --> 1:20:10.471
(Karina)
'She has a gun.'

1:20:10.573 --> 1:20:12.673
'Track my phone. I..'

1:20:14.410 --> 1:20:17.144
Ivan. Ivan, are you okay?

1:20:17.246 --> 1:20:18.813
It's okay, help is on the way.

1:20:18.915 --> 1:20:20.815
- Okay?
- Karina!

1:20:21.918 --> 1:20:25.052
Lena, you have to stop running.

1:20:25.087 --> 1:20:27.788
You have to stop hiding.

1:20:27.890 --> 1:20:30.858
You have to give Emily up.

1:20:30.893 --> 1:20:33.894
You still have a chance
for a relationship with Abby.

1:20:33.930 --> 1:20:35.996
Don't you want a relationship
with her?

1:20:36.098 --> 1:20:38.098
[siren blaring]

1:20:38.134 --> 1:20:40.167
It's too late for that.

1:20:40.269 --> 1:20:42.002
That's not what she told me.

1:20:45.107 --> 1:20:46.974
- W-what?
- We found her.

1:20:47.076 --> 1:20:50.010
[siren blaring]

1:20:53.115 --> 1:20:55.082
It's time to stop hiding.

1:20:56.652 --> 1:20:58.185
Please put down the gun.

1:20:58.287 --> 1:21:00.654
Police. Put the gun down!

1:21:00.690 --> 1:21:02.857
Slowly put the gun down

1:21:02.959 --> 1:21:04.425
and step back.

1:21:05.628 --> 1:21:07.261
Please put down the gun.

1:21:09.332 --> 1:21:11.232
(male #2)
'...gun down, ma'am.'

1:21:14.670 --> 1:21:17.004
'Ma'am, put the gun down.'

1:21:29.986 --> 1:21:31.418
It's okay.

1:21:51.841 --> 1:21:54.842
[instrumental music]

1:22:22.038 --> 1:22:24.972
[music continues]

1:22:34.917 --> 1:22:36.884
[no audio]

1:22:43.759 --> 1:22:45.726
[Mallie slurping]

1:22:45.761 --> 1:22:47.995
Do you want a cracker?

1:22:48.097 --> 1:22:51.398
Who else needs a cracker?
Yum-yum yum-yum.

1:22:51.434 --> 1:22:53.367
[Mallie humming]

1:22:53.402 --> 1:22:55.069
- Emily.
- Yeah?

1:22:55.104 --> 1:22:58.205
Come on out front,
Ryan and I wanna talk to you.

1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:00.040
Okay. Bye.

1:23:10.753 --> 1:23:12.419
Whoa!

1:23:21.664 --> 1:23:25.165
Emily, we have something
very important to tell you.

1:23:25.267 --> 1:23:27.267
Well, what is it?

1:23:27.303 --> 1:23:30.571
Well, we just found out
this morning..

1:23:31.774 --> 1:23:33.574
That you're getting
a baby sister.

1:23:33.609 --> 1:23:36.210
My own baby sister?

1:23:41.617 --> 1:23:43.384
I love you.

1:23:43.486 --> 1:23:45.452
We love you, too.

1:23:45.488 --> 1:23:47.888
Thank you for everything.

1:23:47.990 --> 1:23:49.556
Thank you.

1:23:56.632 --> 1:23:58.165
[laughing]
