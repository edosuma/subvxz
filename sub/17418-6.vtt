00:01.561 --> 00:04.560
The target of the 5th September
ambush was a protected witness.

00:04.561 --> 00:08.932
John Thomas Hunter.
He used the name Alex Campbell.

00:08.969 --> 00:11.948
DS Akers was the person
closest to him.

00:11.949 --> 00:15.633
I need a safe and available
destination ASAP.

00:18.261 --> 00:21.305
You're facing a charge of conspiracy
to murder. That's a life sentence.

00:22.011 --> 00:24.211
I'm not going to be in here
for life - I'm innocent.

00:24.212 --> 00:27.664
We had a deal -
immunity from prosecution,

00:27.702 --> 00:28.946
you two-faced bastard.

00:29.003 --> 00:33.635
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden,
Tommy's "two-faced bastard".

00:33.705 --> 00:37.705
We believe these photos were used by
John Thomas Hunter to blackmail you.

00:40.745 --> 00:42.724
What happened to Cole?

00:42.725 --> 00:44.701
Prasad murdered him.

00:46.574 --> 00:49.462
The suspect has asked me
to record his dying declaration.

00:49.552 --> 00:50.703
'I carried out the ambush

00:50.704 --> 00:53.692
'under orders from
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.'

00:55.688 --> 00:58.707
You are going down
for a long time, fella.

00:58.708 --> 01:01.149
I request immunity from prosecution.

01:01.174 --> 01:03.596

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

01:03.660 --> 01:05.667
What about this other officer,
the Caddy?

01:05.668 --> 01:07.679
Apparently Cole likes
to wear golf jumpers,

01:07.680 --> 01:11.663
but he's never played the game.
Hence, the Caddy.

01:11.664 --> 01:12.688
Nice one.

01:15.644 --> 01:17.358
What is it? Tracking device.

01:17.459 --> 01:20.669
We were investigating Denton.
The whole time it didn't matter
what route she took that night,

01:20.712 --> 01:22.688
the ambushers were tracking Akers!

01:24.680 --> 01:26.668
DI Denton's medical records.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.711
'Unconfirmed sources
allege that the suspect

01:33.712 --> 01:36.676
'is Deputy Chief Constable
Mike Dryden.'

01:39.668 --> 01:42.739
You were the last person to see
Carly Kirk before she disappeared -

01:42.740 --> 01:45.715
the last person to see a girl
who's later found buried

01:45.716 --> 01:47.684
under the industrial unit.

01:49.724 --> 01:52.667
You instigated a conspiracy
that led to the deaths

01:52.668 --> 01:55.684
of four police officers.
The only conspiracy is against me!

02:09.656 --> 02:11.696
Let us commend Elizabeth
to the mercy of God.

02:12.696 --> 02:16.715
We therefore commit her body to
the ground, earth to earth,

02:16.716 --> 02:19.679
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

02:19.680 --> 02:23.704
in the sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life.

02:27.732 --> 02:31.671
You recorded a dying declaration in
which you stated that the ambush

02:31.672 --> 02:35.651
was carried out on the orders of
Deputy Chief Constable Michael Dryden.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.723
That statement was made
under fear for my life,

02:37.724 --> 02:39.735
when I would have said anything.

02:39.736 --> 02:41.723
I retract.

02:41.724 --> 02:43.656
Mother of God.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.647
So, who did order the ambush?

02:47.648 --> 02:48.716
I'm not getting into that.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.644
So what about these photos
of Dryden and Carly Kirk?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.680
It's covered.

03:00.716 --> 03:02.707
I confirm that
Tommy Hunter engaged me

03:02.708 --> 03:05.671
for the purpose of acquiring
incriminating photographs.

03:05.672 --> 03:09.647
Great. Fine. Good. But this is
where my head starts spinning.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.695
Because you're Tommy's man,

03:10.696 --> 03:13.687
and yet here you are involved
with trying to kill him.

03:13.688 --> 03:17.675
Tommy was blackmailing the
Deputy Chief Constable, right?

03:17.676 --> 03:20.735
And if he'd do that to keep his
immunity, what else would he do?

03:20.736 --> 03:23.695
There was a school of thought
that maybe we'd be better off

03:23.696 --> 03:26.679
with Tommy out of the picture.
Who's "we"?

03:26.680 --> 03:29.691
Various parties associated with
Tommy's past, you know?

03:29.692 --> 03:32.723
Well, other departments can follow
those particular lines of inquiry.

03:32.724 --> 03:35.739
We are only interested in
one thing and one thing only -

03:35.740 --> 03:37.736
and that is bent coppers.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.712
Thanks, Steve.
No problem.

03:47.676 --> 03:49.659
I really appreciated this.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.679
I would've hated to have had a couple
of uniforms standing next to me

03:52.680 --> 03:53.716
at the graveside.

03:54.716 --> 03:56.656
It's fine.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.707
Can I ask you one more favour?
Sure.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.704
Do you mind going... just
going by the nursing home?

04:06.648 --> 04:09.687
They want to send
my mum's... personal effects,

04:09.688 --> 04:11.668
and I'd rather go
and get them myself.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.648
I'll get the authority.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.683
We're going to name you
some police officers,

04:21.684 --> 04:24.727
and you are going to tell us what
crime or crimes they committed.

04:24.728 --> 04:26.671
Have you got it?

04:26.672 --> 04:30.655
We're going to start with Deputy
Chief Constable Michael Dryden.

04:30.656 --> 04:33.671
Dryden got himself
blown by the girl.

04:33.672 --> 04:34.708
Did he kill her?

04:36.716 --> 04:38.663
To confirm the agreement,

04:38.664 --> 04:43.656
any evidence that you give in this
regard is immune from prosecution.

04:46.724 --> 04:49.683
We had the photos...

04:49.684 --> 04:52.659
but we needed the threat of
the girl being able to testify

04:52.660 --> 04:54.679
to really turn the screw.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.723
But she did a runner.

04:56.724 --> 04:58.663
So you killed her?

04:58.664 --> 05:00.723
Are you listening to me?
She did a runner.

05:00.724 --> 05:02.655
And so what did you do?

05:02.656 --> 05:04.707
We got another body, dressed her up
in a waitress' uniform,

05:04.708 --> 05:06.644
and took photos.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.687
This body... Another girl.

05:09.688 --> 05:12.688
Who? Just some little
slapper that fit the bill.

05:26.712 --> 05:28.703
Put this case anywhere
before I go?

05:28.704 --> 05:31.671
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.
It's just, erm...

05:31.672 --> 05:34.676
up the stairs, it's the room
at the front of the house.

05:47.660 --> 05:48.696
Bye.

05:50.660 --> 05:51.716
Bye.

06:01.708 --> 06:05.663
Look, DS Jayne Akers,
the witness protection officer,

06:05.664 --> 06:06.707
how'd she get involved?

06:06.708 --> 06:08.720
There's a middleman.
Who?

06:10.684 --> 06:14.671
I never met him. We just
talked over payphones.

06:14.672 --> 06:16.663
No name.

06:16.664 --> 06:17.715
He fixed Akers.

06:17.716 --> 06:20.659
So Akers knew who he was?

06:20.660 --> 06:22.683
Was this why Akers was killed?

06:22.684 --> 06:23.739
She knew names.

06:23.740 --> 06:28.648
This middleman. We have
DC Jeremy Cole named as the Caddy.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.699
Cole couldn't organise
a piss-up in a brewery.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.668
So he wasn't the Caddy?

06:35.716 --> 06:37.696
Well, if he was, it's news to me.

06:38.720 --> 06:42.643
One final name we're interested in
is DI Lindsay Denton.

06:42.644 --> 06:46.664
What about her? At the ambush,
why was DI Lindsay Denton spared?

06:50.728 --> 06:53.687
All I know, there was an order.

06:53.688 --> 06:55.715
What was the order?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.668
"Don't hurt Denton."

07:09.676 --> 07:11.691
I'm sorry about your mum.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.708
Thanks.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.679
We're going to show you CCTV

07:15.680 --> 07:17.728
captured on the evening
of the 16th of August.

07:19.668 --> 07:22.656
It shows Dryden and Prasad
at an event at City Hall.

07:24.728 --> 07:27.644
I'm now going to fast-forward a bit.

07:34.652 --> 07:36.687
Oh, my God. That's Carly.

07:36.688 --> 07:40.647
I now want to show you
another image from the same night.

07:40.648 --> 07:43.652
This is the security camera
at the City Hall car park.

07:45.740 --> 07:48.648
It shows Dryden leaving with Carly.

07:49.676 --> 07:52.691
You were investigating
the disappearance of Carly Kirk,

07:52.692 --> 07:54.663
this is crucial evidence.

07:54.664 --> 07:56.715
You must be frustrated
you didn't find it earlier.

07:56.716 --> 07:58.723
Extremely frustrated.

07:58.724 --> 08:01.683
Well, we're now in a position to
inform you of a development

08:01.684 --> 08:04.683
with the body found
under the garage floor.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.739
Have they confirmed that it's her?

08:06.740 --> 08:08.740
The opposite - it isn't her.

08:13.664 --> 08:17.659
Well... that's wonderful.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.708
She means a lot to you,
doesn't she, ma'am?

08:20.716 --> 08:23.704
Well, why wouldn't the life
of a child mean a lot to anyone?

08:28.684 --> 08:32.722
I didn't know this was happening.
Sit down. The more, the merrier.

08:32.724 --> 08:34.731
Thank you, DI Denton.

08:34.732 --> 08:38.688
You OK? I said sit down,
for the second time, DS Arnott.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.643
We'll now show you
the second vehicle captured

08:50.644 --> 08:51.884
leaving the City Hall car park.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.716
What does this image show?
You can't do this.

09:00.648 --> 09:02.712
Are you prepared to answer that
question, DI Denton?

09:07.700 --> 09:09.656
The image shows me.

09:11.648 --> 09:12.769
Why were you there, Lindsay?

09:15.704 --> 09:20.643
Mike wasn't returning my calls.
I went there to confront him.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.735
In a public space,
he would have to avoid a scene.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.703
So instead you followed him.

09:24.704 --> 09:27.699
No, I didn't. I was upset.
I went straight home.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.691
What upset you?

09:29.692 --> 09:31.727
Seeing him.
Seeing him with Carly Kirk?

09:31.728 --> 09:34.671
I saw Mike at the function.
I didn't see Carly.

09:34.672 --> 09:36.659
No? Well, they're
right in front of you.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.703
Kate. She's answered.

09:37.704 --> 09:40.659
I absolutely didn't see that Carly
was in the car with him.

09:40.660 --> 09:43.687
Do you seriously expect us
to believe that?

09:43.688 --> 09:46.739
The first thing I knew about Carly
Kirk was when I was put on her case.

09:46.740 --> 09:50.671
After the ambush.
Before that, I knew nothing.

09:50.672 --> 09:53.695
If I had, I'd have investigated.
There'd be evidence on my hard drive.

09:53.696 --> 09:55.664
We looked. There wasn't any.

09:57.692 --> 09:58.712
It's fine.

10:02.704 --> 10:03.736
Thank you, DI Denton.

10:05.676 --> 10:09.703
We'll place this interview in the
case file and submit it to the CPS.

10:09.704 --> 10:11.728
Glad to have been of help, sir.

10:13.728 --> 10:15.672
I'll give you a lift home.

10:52.712 --> 10:56.679
I've had an opportunity
to discuss your case file

10:56.680 --> 10:58.675
with the Crown Prosecutor

10:58.676 --> 11:01.724
and I have been authorised by her
to proceed as follows.

11:02.724 --> 11:07.651
In respect of conspiracy to murder
a protected witness -

11:07.652 --> 11:09.731
on the grounds of
insufficient evidence,

11:09.732 --> 11:12.735
there will be no charge
at this time.

11:12.736 --> 11:15.736
In respect of
sexual activity with a child -

11:17.708 --> 11:20.671
..on the grounds
of insufficient evidence,

11:20.672 --> 11:23.659
there will be no charge
at this time.

11:23.660 --> 11:26.679
In respect of perverting
the course of justice,

11:26.680 --> 11:32.643
in relation to your wife's driving
offence, you will be charged now.

11:32.644 --> 11:36.659
The Custody Officer has been
authorised to release you

11:36.660 --> 11:39.663
on conditional bail.
And in the meantime

11:39.664 --> 11:42.739
I will submit your case file
to the Crown Prosecution Service.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.704
Interview terminated.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.736
I'll fight this.

11:51.656 --> 11:54.659
The Crown Prosecutor and I are
of a mind to believe that you were

11:54.660 --> 11:58.727
knowingly establishing an alibi
for your activities with Carly Kirk.

11:58.728 --> 12:02.735
Now, the Crown Prosecutor may not
feel that there was enough evidence.

12:02.736 --> 12:05.688
As for me,
I would throw the book at you.

12:06.716 --> 12:08.688
That wee girl, she was only 15.

12:11.652 --> 12:14.656
Come on. We're done here.
Ted. Wait. Please.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.740
If you wouldn't mind.

12:21.656 --> 12:22.720
Thank you, Kate.

12:26.648 --> 12:28.731
I've made a catastrophic
error of judgment.

12:28.732 --> 12:31.711
And I need to make amends.

12:31.712 --> 12:34.691
You and Les Hargreaves still
haven't found out

12:34.692 --> 12:36.671
who orchestrated the ambush.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.711
You've got to get to
the bottom of this, Ted.

12:38.712 --> 12:41.703
I don't want my last, most important
case to end in failure.

12:41.704 --> 12:43.711
There are things I can do to help.

12:43.712 --> 12:45.648
If you say so.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.659
This is now
a voluntary intelligence interview.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.732
Go and make sure they
don't cock up bail. You sure? Yes.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.707
What's he up to?

12:56.708 --> 12:58.672
Oldest trick in the book.

13:06.688 --> 13:11.707
You've got the gunmen but you need
the people who ordered the ambush.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.648
I can be of help.

13:15.704 --> 13:18.707
And if your information was to lead
to a breakthrough...

13:18.708 --> 13:20.715
Then it wouldn't be too much to ask
for the CPS to

13:20.716 --> 13:22.719
look at dropping
the charge against me.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.708
With a nudge from me?

13:27.712 --> 13:32.675
Lindsay Denton was following me the
evening the photographs were taken,

13:32.676 --> 13:36.691
irrespective of what she says or
what the mobile phone evidence says.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.687
I am sick to my back teeth of this
mud-slinging between you

13:39.688 --> 13:42.727
and your bit on the side. I am
talking about a conspiracy here

13:42.728 --> 13:45.715
in which four police officers
were killed!

13:45.716 --> 13:47.676
Listen to me, Ted. Listen.

13:50.668 --> 13:55.647
I gave Carly Kirk a lift
to Edge Park Railway Station.

13:55.648 --> 13:59.683
That's when I saw Lindsay Denton.
There'll be CCTV.

13:59.684 --> 14:03.647
Now, her being there can only
mean that she knows

14:03.648 --> 14:06.736
more about the girl, the... entrapment,
the ambush than she's letting on.

14:08.716 --> 14:11.711
I'm not being vindictive, Ted.

14:11.712 --> 14:15.648
I just want the guilty parties
brought to justice.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.659
Now, Edge Park's a small station.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.663
This is the only camera that faces
away from the platforms.

14:22.664 --> 14:25.691
Now, there's no trains for half an
hour so nothing's coming in or out

14:25.692 --> 14:28.739
but then what appears to be
Dryden's vehicle,

14:28.740 --> 14:31.715
carrying him and Carly, enters.

14:31.716 --> 14:36.715
15 minutes later, Dryden's vehicle
exits at high speed.

14:36.716 --> 14:40.712
Passenger seat's empty. No Carly.
But if we keep going...

14:43.644 --> 14:48.691
..shortly after, an unidentified
vehicle exits the car park.

14:48.692 --> 14:49.740
But if we rewind...

14:52.676 --> 14:56.699
..that same vehicle is seen entering
the car park

14:56.700 --> 14:59.655
15 minutes before Dryden's.

14:59.656 --> 15:02.671
This is the vehicle used to obtain
the photos of Dryden and Carly?

15:02.672 --> 15:03.715
Most likely.

15:03.716 --> 15:06.735
Do we have any sighting
of Denton at all?

15:06.736 --> 15:08.652
No.

15:10.712 --> 15:14.651
No. She could've been there but just
knew how to avoid the cameras.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.651
Dryden didn't.
What makes Denton so smart?

15:17.652 --> 15:19.647
Because she is, Steve.

15:19.648 --> 15:22.719
Well, I see nothing here
to incriminate Denton.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.703
Dot, have you got a minute? Sir.

15:24.704 --> 15:26.735
Get ready, you two,
we've got a meeting to go to.

15:26.736 --> 15:28.672
Yes, sir.

15:31.728 --> 15:35.679
Now listen, you and I both know that
Prasad is a lying so-and-so

15:35.680 --> 15:37.739
but he's saying no
to Cole being the Caddy.

15:37.740 --> 15:40.695
Now, the Caddy, as you know,
is the missing link

15:40.696 --> 15:44.691
between the criminal parties and the
corrupt officers, I'm sure of it.

15:44.692 --> 15:46.691
And he's your responsibility,
Matthew.

15:46.692 --> 15:49.723
Sir. Yeah, I'm... I'm on it.

15:49.724 --> 15:51.731
Yeah. Sir.

15:51.732 --> 15:54.700
I will return to it. Yes, sir.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.695
You found a lump on Akers' car,
and you hid it from us.

16:07.696 --> 16:10.667
There were irregularities
with the evidence.

16:10.668 --> 16:11.739
What irregularities?

16:11.740 --> 16:14.735
Forensics on the tracking device
were inconclusive

16:14.736 --> 16:16.704
due to fire damage.

16:17.696 --> 16:20.688
Is that a good enough reason to not
share the evidence?

16:23.712 --> 16:25.720
We'd appreciate those reports.

16:28.648 --> 16:29.695
Jolly?

16:29.696 --> 16:31.659
I'll e-mail them today.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.644
It's all right, have mine.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.695
Ta.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.720
Thank you,
Detective Chief Superintendent. Mm.

16:43.664 --> 16:44.723
We are not the enemy.

16:44.724 --> 16:47.723
Why don't you try telling that
to Mike Dryden, eh?

16:47.724 --> 16:49.672
Best boss I've ever had.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.712
Come on.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.691
So, this is where
the ambush happened.

17:23.692 --> 17:26.646
Three of our own
killed in cold blood.

17:26.647 --> 17:27.723
Poor buggers.

17:27.723 --> 17:30.707
See, I wondered if
you might recognise this place.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.735
Me? Why?

17:32.736 --> 17:37.707
It's because of what we talked about
last time - the Caddy.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.731
Jeremy Cole. Right.

17:39.732 --> 17:43.663
So. Cole. He knew this was
the right place for the set-up.

17:43.664 --> 17:46.731
Fast roads, in and out,
far enough out for there to be

17:46.732 --> 17:50.703
no witnesses, not so far that you'd
think you'd en route to Timbuktu.

17:50.704 --> 17:51.735
Makes sense.

17:51.736 --> 17:53.715
Now, here's the thing.

17:53.716 --> 17:58.643
If you could go the extra mile
for me, say you came here with Cole,

17:58.644 --> 18:00.692
we could all sign off
from this happy.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.711
How's that work?

18:03.712 --> 18:07.691
Cole brought you here, told you
he had underworld connections,

18:07.692 --> 18:09.707
had had since he was a lad.

18:09.708 --> 18:12.724
Thought you might be susceptible
to earning a few quid.

18:15.740 --> 18:19.667
Problem? It's beginning to sound
like something I'd be smart to

18:19.668 --> 18:21.740
stay well out of.
Me too, mate. But I can't.

18:24.732 --> 18:27.719
But that's Anti-Corruption for you.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.683
Hastings never lets anything drop,
does he?

18:30.684 --> 18:31.712
Sorry.

18:34.676 --> 18:37.651
You see, now you've got me worried.

18:37.652 --> 18:39.715
No need. No, but I am, though, I am.

18:39.716 --> 18:41.660
Mate...

18:42.720 --> 18:44.691
Am I, though?

18:44.692 --> 18:46.656
A mate? Sure.

18:49.652 --> 18:50.664
Yeah?

18:59.720 --> 19:00.736
OK, then.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.659
"OK, then," what?

19:06.660 --> 19:07.727
I can rely on you. To...?

19:07.728 --> 19:09.731
To provide a statement.

19:09.732 --> 19:14.647
You provide a statement saying Cole
boasted of underworld connections

19:14.648 --> 19:16.643
and attempted to recruit you into

19:16.644 --> 19:19.644
a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

19:58.684 --> 19:59.728
Shit!

20:32.648 --> 20:33.708
Better not overdo it.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.716
You said you got rid of a cat
because of Dryden.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.687
Why would you bring that up again?

20:46.688 --> 20:49.708
Because AC-12 can access
an officer's medical records.

20:55.644 --> 20:56.672
It wasn't a cat.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.720
Are you going to sit in judgment? No.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.691
First AC-12 make a case against me

21:05.692 --> 21:08.671
because I spent all my money caring
for my mother. And now I'm what?

21:08.672 --> 21:09.720
I'm sorry.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.659
Must've been
very upsetting for you.

21:14.660 --> 21:20.724
You think? Bringing something...
alive and lovely into this place...

21:24.680 --> 21:25.684
What happened?

21:27.692 --> 21:29.671
Mike and his wife,

21:29.672 --> 21:32.660
they didn't have kids,
it wasn't part of the plan.

21:33.684 --> 21:35.667
Did you talk to him about it?

21:35.668 --> 21:38.716
I tried. He denied it was his.

21:41.736 --> 21:45.703
It must've been very difficult,
coping on your own.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.716
It's the worst thing
I've ever done.

21:49.648 --> 21:50.708
Will be as long as I live.

22:00.724 --> 22:02.676
I'd better go.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.700
You should get some rest. Yeah.

22:18.672 --> 22:19.704
I don't sleep.

22:20.724 --> 22:22.664
Do you?

23:05.676 --> 23:07.707
Morning, sir. Morning.

23:07.708 --> 23:10.675
So I've had a bit of a problem
with my job motor.

23:10.676 --> 23:13.679
See, my friend, his broke down,
so I lent it him,

23:13.680 --> 23:14.739
tried to do him a favour.

23:14.740 --> 23:18.663
Now, the last thing
I want to do is put a bloke in it,

23:18.664 --> 23:21.675
but I can't get hold of him...
DC Morton?

23:21.676 --> 23:22.699
Yeah.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.699
DC Morton's just returning
your service vehicle now, sir.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.668
Can you sign me back out?

23:46.668 --> 23:48.663
Find your way home all right?

23:48.664 --> 23:49.692
Eventually.

23:51.652 --> 23:53.724
All got a bit... unnecessary,
don't you think?

23:55.648 --> 23:58.715
Well, I don't know what to think,
to be honest, mate.

23:58.716 --> 24:01.711
Disability benefits,

24:01.712 --> 24:06.643
all the cushy assignments,
none of the brass dare touch me.

24:06.644 --> 24:07.712
Right.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.664
You know my secrets.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.667
Now I know yours.

24:15.668 --> 24:19.736
This was hidden under the back seat.
Unregistered pay-as-you-go.

24:21.652 --> 24:23.671
Lots of interesting numbers.

24:23.672 --> 24:26.655
I made a note - won't say where -

24:26.656 --> 24:29.699
just in case someone fancies
digging out your call history.

24:29.700 --> 24:33.680
Plus all the details about last night
in case something happens to me.

24:36.660 --> 24:37.692
That was in the past.

24:39.648 --> 24:40.700
I'm clean now.

24:43.692 --> 24:44.716
Me too.

24:48.660 --> 24:51.684
But seems daft to blow
the whistle on each other.

25:17.736 --> 25:19.740
Thank you once again, DI Denton.

25:21.708 --> 25:24.739
We've received the forensics report
on the tracker device found

25:24.740 --> 25:28.651
under the front left wheel
arch of Akers' vehicle.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.711
There are some irregularities
that need to be explained.

25:30.712 --> 25:31.723
Irregularities?

25:31.724 --> 25:34.663
Well, the tracker would be
expected to retain paint

25:34.664 --> 25:37.655
and metal residues transferred
during its prolonged contact

25:37.656 --> 25:39.719
with the under-surface of
Akers' vehicle.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.691
And it doesn't.

25:41.692 --> 25:44.715
Instead there's a mix of residues,

25:44.716 --> 25:47.675
a proportion of which are
consistent with the underside of

25:47.676 --> 25:52.667
service vehicle -
registration number NV54 OFT.

25:52.668 --> 25:54.663
This being the service vehicle

25:54.664 --> 25:56.739
you were driving
on the night of the ambush.

25:56.740 --> 25:58.719
Uh...

25:58.720 --> 26:02.692
Obviously this is a...
very peculiar finding.

26:03.700 --> 26:07.695
I don't know very much about it,
but I wonder if...

26:07.696 --> 26:13.691
if possibly exposure to the very
high temperatures of the fire
have caused an error.

26:13.692 --> 26:16.740
Open flames typically reach
900 degrees Celsius.

26:19.736 --> 26:22.659
You just said you didn't know
much about it.

26:22.660 --> 26:25.675
No, I... I didn't, I was just taken
aback by the heat of the fire

26:25.676 --> 26:28.667
at the time and it's something I...
looked up afterwards.

26:28.668 --> 26:30.671
Well, picking up on the forensics,
though,

26:30.672 --> 26:32.731
let's speculate on
whether the tracker might not have

26:32.732 --> 26:36.655
been on Akers' vehicle prior to it
being found there that night.

26:36.656 --> 26:39.699
You were a variable. Maybe you'd get
suspicious and ruin the plan.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.672
So they put a tracker on your car.

26:42.704 --> 26:44.651
That's not what happened.

26:44.652 --> 26:46.719
Or you were a scapegoat.
Left alive to carry the blame.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.727
And the tracker
would only add to that.

26:48.728 --> 26:51.667
As I just said,
that's not what happened.

26:51.668 --> 26:55.667
And yet, DI Denton, that's what
the forensics are implying.

26:55.668 --> 26:57.711
With respect, sir, this
conversation can't take place.

26:57.712 --> 26:59.735
You're asking DI Denton
questions relating to

26:59.736 --> 27:01.691
the charge of conspiracy to murder,

27:01.692 --> 27:04.675
questions specifically
off-limits under legal process.

27:04.676 --> 27:06.695
Nobody's accusing Lindsay
of anything here.

27:06.696 --> 27:11.663
She's answering purely as
a witness, DS Arnott. That right?

27:11.664 --> 27:12.695
Yeah, of course.

27:12.696 --> 27:15.647
Was it possible that a tracker
could've been placed

27:15.648 --> 27:17.703
under your car
without your knowledge?

27:17.704 --> 27:19.655
It's possible.

27:19.656 --> 27:21.691
Because, if you were sure
it couldn't be there,

27:21.692 --> 27:24.676
that would mean you'd checked -
and why would you do that?

27:31.672 --> 27:35.728
Look, I... I'm sorry, do you mind
if I just take a loo break?

27:37.648 --> 27:38.736
Of course. Thank you.

27:47.728 --> 27:49.699
What the hell's this?

27:49.700 --> 27:53.643
Well, we have on record the time
Denton radioed in status zero.

27:53.644 --> 27:56.719
Various figures are bandied about
but the best estimate is between

27:56.720 --> 28:00.695
four and five minutes elapsed
before the blue lights arrived.

28:00.696 --> 28:03.704
Now, if you were her,
what would you do in that time?

28:05.676 --> 28:07.719
My bet is, she found the tracker
and she moved it.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.687
Because that's the one thing that
would prove she was part

28:10.688 --> 28:13.739
of the ambush conspiracy before she
got the emergency call that night.

28:13.740 --> 28:18.644
Conspirator or scapegoat, either
way, she was known to the ambushers.

28:37.644 --> 28:38.716
I like your necklace.

28:40.704 --> 28:42.723
Sorry?

28:42.724 --> 28:45.700
Your necklace. It's really pretty.

29:14.696 --> 29:18.699
I can't explain the irregularities
on the forensics.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.671
But you must accept it's possible
that somebody may have placed

29:21.672 --> 29:23.723
the tracker on your vehicle
without your knowledge?

29:23.724 --> 29:25.679
I don't, actually, DC Fleming.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.655
Because that would mean that
I was known to the conspirators

29:28.656 --> 29:30.660
prior to the ambush, and I wasn't.

29:31.668 --> 29:33.712
Well, then why would there be
an order to spare you?

29:35.728 --> 29:38.715
An order to spare me?
Kate, you can't ask this.

29:38.716 --> 29:42.647
I'm sorry, did somebody say
there was an order to spare me?

29:42.648 --> 29:44.659
DI Denton,
it would help us considerably

29:44.660 --> 29:47.663
if you would be prepared to
address the issue.

29:47.664 --> 29:51.663
I mean, if you'd rather not...
I'm sorry, sir. I just...

29:51.664 --> 29:54.655
I just always wondered
if I was lucky.

29:54.656 --> 29:56.731
But now I realise they...
they must've known

29:56.732 --> 30:00.671
I had nothing to do with it,
and... they planned to let me go.

30:00.672 --> 30:02.667
So you were known to them.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.731
They could have used you
to track the convoy.

30:04.732 --> 30:07.735
Which would mean there was a tracker
and it had to have been moved.

30:07.736 --> 30:10.659
Could've been a tracker,
could've been moved.

30:10.660 --> 30:13.679
There's no "could've" about it, DI
Denton, that's what forensics says.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.711
Yes, but,
as a word to the wise, sir,

30:15.712 --> 30:18.736
it's legally unacceptable for you
to ask me if I moved it.

30:21.644 --> 30:23.671
Do you know who moved it?

30:23.672 --> 30:26.675
Very good. No, I don't.

30:26.676 --> 30:29.659
Was it moved before
the blue lights arrived?

30:29.660 --> 30:31.683
Akers' car was on fire.

30:31.684 --> 30:34.683
Nobody could get near that car
until the fire was out.

30:34.684 --> 30:37.651
It would be possible to transfer
the tracker using

30:37.652 --> 30:40.667
some kind of implement that would
extend a person's reach.

30:40.668 --> 30:43.680
Hmm. And was such an implement
found at the scene?

30:46.660 --> 30:48.668
No. No.

30:54.656 --> 30:56.652
Right, is there anything else?

30:58.660 --> 31:00.704
No. Thank you,
DI Denton, that will be all.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.684
Well done, Kate.
You gave it your best shot.

31:21.652 --> 31:23.675
Nicking criminals is hard enough.

31:23.676 --> 31:25.728
Nicking coppers -
God give me strength.

31:51.708 --> 31:52.728
DS Arnott.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.696
What? I'm on my way.

32:05.696 --> 32:08.699
Cheers, mate. Thanks for the call.
No problem.

32:08.700 --> 32:09.739
Kate, let's go.

32:09.740 --> 32:12.691
The bastard's changed the locks.
I bloody live here!

32:12.692 --> 32:14.643
Let's get you out of here, mate.

32:14.644 --> 32:16.643
The last thing
I need right now is you.

32:16.644 --> 32:18.715
These two uniforms are doing you a
favour. So am I. I live here, Steve!

32:18.716 --> 32:20.660
Kate, move.

32:21.708 --> 32:23.663
All right?

32:23.664 --> 32:24.745
I've got her, mate. Thanks.

32:27.716 --> 32:29.671
What's going on?

32:29.672 --> 32:31.651
I just wanted to see my son.

32:31.652 --> 32:33.647
You will.
Just not in the middle of the night.

32:33.648 --> 32:35.703
Well, I haven't got
anywhere else to go.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.679
Where've you been staying?

32:37.680 --> 32:38.696
Kate.

32:41.724 --> 32:43.707
I was undercover on Denton
and I blew it.

32:43.708 --> 32:45.691
And now we're blowing
the whole case.

32:45.692 --> 32:47.699
I need to close this, Steve,
or I've got nothing.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.679
Listen... You were shagging the
nurse and now you're shagging

32:50.680 --> 32:52.687
the prime suspect. I'm not.
I saw you together.

32:52.688 --> 32:55.655
Your undercover failed because
we underestimated Lindsay.

32:55.656 --> 32:56.671
Mine's succeeding...

32:56.672 --> 32:59.699
because she underestimates me
just as much as you do.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.704
What?

33:02.660 --> 33:05.720
I think you're right about her.
OK? I think she done it.

33:11.676 --> 33:12.712
You OK?

33:14.688 --> 33:15.708
No.

33:18.680 --> 33:23.664
Come here. All right. It's
all right. You'll be all right.

33:29.668 --> 33:30.688
Cheers, Steve.

33:31.716 --> 33:34.671
Well, we're definitely
missing something.

33:34.672 --> 33:37.695
The scene of the ambush has been
gone through every which way.

33:37.696 --> 33:40.664
There aren't any forensics that
incriminate Lindsay.

33:41.740 --> 33:45.691
Look, let's scrap the ambush for
a bit, we need to go back further.

33:45.692 --> 33:49.651
We know she was there at City Hall
on the night of the 16th.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.663
Let's assume Lindsay
did follow Dryden

33:51.664 --> 33:53.667
and Carly to the
train station, right.

33:53.668 --> 33:56.671
There was limited CCTV coverage and
she's clever enough to avoid

33:56.672 --> 34:00.671
the camera, but she does witness
the sting on Dryden involving Carly.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.643
I mean, she's always denied
a connection to Tommy.

34:03.644 --> 34:05.667
But this would be it,
20 days before the ambush.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.731
Carly's the connection.
If Lindsay was there,

34:07.732 --> 34:11.643
she would have known about Carly
much earlier than she claims.

34:11.643 --> 34:12.708
That would leave a trail.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.703
Get dressed.

34:16.704 --> 34:18.656
You break a girl's heart.

34:33.684 --> 34:35.704
May we have a word, please, sir?

34:41.735 --> 34:44.684
DS Arnott, sir. DC Fleming.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.739
You were here undercover. Yes, sir.

34:48.739 --> 34:50.679
Still spying on us?

34:50.679 --> 34:52.687
Sir, we've got
a few questions in regard to

34:52.688 --> 34:54.663
our investigation into DI Denton.

34:54.664 --> 34:56.683
I'd like my
Superintendents' Association rep here

34:56.684 --> 34:58.647
before I address your questions.

34:58.648 --> 35:00.735
It's your prerogative, sir,
if you want to go down that route.

35:00.736 --> 35:02.735
Or you can continue as a witness

35:02.736 --> 35:06.691
and AC-12 will note your cooperation
within your performance review.

35:06.692 --> 35:09.660
We hear you're applying
for the Executive Officers' course.

35:10.672 --> 35:13.659
Sir, with regard to DI Denton,
we know she was

35:13.660 --> 35:15.704
interested in the disappearance
of Carly Kirk.

35:18.672 --> 35:22.647
It's one of the missing persons cases
placed on 28-day review

35:22.648 --> 35:23.969
and placed within Denton's brief.

35:25.652 --> 35:28.675
Did she ever show any interest
in the case before then, sir?

35:28.676 --> 35:31.679
No. No, she didn't.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.735
As far as I know, it was only
when I put her on the 28s,

35:33.736 --> 35:35.683
after the ambush.

35:35.684 --> 35:36.727
Right.

35:36.728 --> 35:38.735
Who dealt with the case originally?

35:38.736 --> 35:41.680
Response officer was
Sergeant O'Neill.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.691
We were at 4th Street today.

35:50.692 --> 35:52.643
Really?

35:52.644 --> 35:54.671
We're looking at the Duty Sergeant.

35:54.672 --> 35:56.696
O'Neill? Yeah.

35:58.692 --> 36:00.735
I checked his record.

36:00.736 --> 36:03.691
Seen you had a run-in with him
last year,

36:03.692 --> 36:06.707
got him disciplined for misuse
of his work computer.

36:06.708 --> 36:09.700
Yeah. There was never
any love lost between us two.

36:10.732 --> 36:13.732
We know he took the call from Akers
the night of the ambush.

36:15.668 --> 36:19.719
Could he have been in on it,
let you take the blame?

36:19.720 --> 36:22.675
I don't see how.
Do you want another drink?

36:22.676 --> 36:23.712
Yeah.

36:38.708 --> 36:40.735
What duties did you carry out
in connection with

36:40.736 --> 36:42.684
the disappearance of Carly Kirk?

36:44.688 --> 36:46.643
Uh...

36:46.644 --> 36:48.652
I was the initial response officer.

36:50.648 --> 36:53.647
As soon as we found out
about her disappearance,

36:53.648 --> 36:57.703
I organised the interview with her
foster parents, her mates.

36:57.704 --> 37:01.683
I organised the door-to-door,
but it were a dead end.

37:01.684 --> 37:03.719
She went on a 28-day
review after that

37:03.720 --> 37:05.708
and I had nowt to do with the case.

37:07.672 --> 37:10.727
We've uncovered information that
Carly Kirk was involved in

37:10.728 --> 37:14.712
a blackmail conspiracy with a man
using the name of Alex Campbell.

37:16.664 --> 37:19.703
As part of our investigation,
we seized your work computer.

37:19.704 --> 37:22.695
On the hard drive we found evidence
of a police database search

37:22.696 --> 37:24.735
carried out on the 25th August
of this year

37:24.736 --> 37:27.731
in respect of the name
Alex Campbell.

37:27.732 --> 37:31.668
Sergeant, why were you gathering
information on Alex Campbell?

37:32.700 --> 37:33.740
I wasn't, sir.

37:35.644 --> 37:36.672
You deny it?

37:37.676 --> 37:39.647
Yes, sir.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.735
Sergeant O'Neill has
a history of misconduct.

37:41.736 --> 37:44.683
A yellow notice for using
his work computer

37:44.684 --> 37:45.739
to access online gambling sites.

37:45.740 --> 37:48.687
Yellow notice already.
Two strikes and you're out.

37:48.688 --> 37:50.731
No job, no pension.
On the night of the ambush,

37:50.732 --> 37:53.739
Sergeant O'Neill was the
Duty Sergeant at 4th Street Station.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.711
You lost two good mates that night.

37:55.712 --> 37:58.676
Come on, why were you gathering
information on Alex Campbell?

38:00.672 --> 38:02.679
I've no need to tell you, Sergeant,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.707
conspiracy to murder carries
a life sentence.

38:05.708 --> 38:07.663
This will not be a red notice.

38:07.664 --> 38:09.712
I will go for
the full criminal prosecution.

38:14.664 --> 38:15.720
You need to start talking.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.660
Now.

38:29.652 --> 38:30.723
Hi, ma'am, how are you?

38:30.724 --> 38:32.671
Yeah, fine.

38:32.672 --> 38:34.719
Would you be prepared to
accompany me to a crime scene?

38:34.720 --> 38:37.655
It may help us find Carly Kirk.

38:37.656 --> 38:39.708
Where? Edge Park Railway Station.

38:41.676 --> 38:42.712
Yeah. Absolutely.

39:00.660 --> 39:01.675
When I worked with you,

39:01.676 --> 39:03.739
I saw first-hand how much
it meant to you finding Carly.

39:03.740 --> 39:05.711
Just doing my job.

39:05.712 --> 39:08.643
You don't have to put up
a front, ma'am.

39:08.644 --> 39:10.687
With missing persons,
sometimes you feel a connection.

39:10.688 --> 39:11.720
We're not machines.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.655
Well, now we now know that
Carly might be alive,

39:16.656 --> 39:18.727
her visit here with Dryden may be
crucial to finding her.

39:18.728 --> 39:22.712
I'd like to find her,
just to know that she's OK.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.660
I think you were here that evening.

39:29.684 --> 39:33.644
I think you can help us find her.
Who else was here?

39:34.644 --> 39:35.664
I wouldn't know.

39:36.696 --> 39:39.679
Alex Campbell, aka Tommy Hunter -
the protected witness.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.691
I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can't help you.

39:41.692 --> 39:43.651
Carly's in terrible danger.

39:43.652 --> 39:45.712
God only knows what might be
happening to her.

39:47.696 --> 39:49.647
What happened here, Lindsay?

39:49.648 --> 39:51.648
I don't know because I wasn't here.

39:56.688 --> 39:59.668
Why don't you
just tell me the truth?

40:05.736 --> 40:08.672
I want to go home now.

40:42.704 --> 40:43.728
Thanks.

41:21.648 --> 41:22.708
Hi. Hi.

41:25.740 --> 41:27.683
I like your necklace.

41:27.684 --> 41:29.643
Sorry?

41:29.644 --> 41:31.707
Your necklace. It's really pretty.

41:31.708 --> 41:34.719
Thanks. My mum gave it to me.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.679
Lucky you.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.663
I don't think it's anything special.
It's just a cheap one.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.716
I meant that you have a mum that
gives you nice things.

42:25.652 --> 42:26.712
Get out.

42:46.732 --> 42:48.723
What did you do?

42:48.724 --> 42:50.668
... off!

42:53.664 --> 42:55.719
Tom, let's just get her in the car.
Come on.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.664
You wee tramp!

42:58.728 --> 43:01.648
Come here.
Come here to me. You idiot.

43:02.732 --> 43:06.703
You tramp! Come here, you. To me!

43:06.704 --> 43:08.664
Bring her to me!

44:09.668 --> 44:11.643
Been messing with my computer?

44:11.644 --> 44:13.648
You been up to your old habits?

44:14.648 --> 44:15.719
I should report you.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.703
And have somebody trawling
through your hard drive?

44:18.704 --> 44:20.672
With your track record?

44:31.712 --> 44:33.671
Alex Campbell?

44:33.672 --> 44:35.711
I need to get to the chemist.

44:35.712 --> 44:39.672
DI Denton. This vehicle's
registered to Alex Campbell.

44:40.692 --> 44:43.667
My apologies.
How can I help you, Inspector?

44:43.668 --> 44:46.672
The vehicle's linked to a reported
assault on a girl.

44:50.700 --> 44:51.740
Is there a problem here?

44:56.676 --> 45:00.648
No. No problem.
Think I must have the wrong person.

45:02.652 --> 45:04.672
You have a good day, Inspector.

45:31.740 --> 45:35.704
Sorry to disturb you at home, ma'am.
Can I come in, please?

45:47.644 --> 45:49.655
What do you know
about Mr Campbell, ma'am?

45:49.656 --> 45:50.715
I'd rather not say.

45:50.716 --> 45:52.735
You left pretty sharpish.

45:52.736 --> 45:56.739
Maybe you weren't acting in a...
official capacity.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.687
I shouldn't have got involved.

45:58.688 --> 46:00.655
You are involved, ma'am.

46:00.656 --> 46:01.695
Meaning?

46:01.696 --> 46:05.683
Meaning... that I was hoping
we could develop a common purpose.

46:05.684 --> 46:06.731
I don't think so.

46:06.732 --> 46:09.700
The girl. You know she's only 15?

46:11.736 --> 46:15.695
Girls, drugs, guns.
He's been into the lot.

46:15.696 --> 46:18.687
And he still is,
and we can't touch him for it.

46:18.688 --> 46:20.651
Right.

46:20.652 --> 46:23.715
This girl. They've drugged her.
They've pimped her.

46:23.716 --> 46:25.667
They've beat her.

46:25.668 --> 46:28.680
There isn't anything they haven't
done to her, and won't keep doing.

46:31.688 --> 46:35.644
So let's start talking about
saving this girl's life.

46:36.704 --> 46:39.687
I'll arrest him. I'll bring him
into 4th Street Station.

46:39.688 --> 46:42.659
It's not going to happen.

46:42.660 --> 46:44.651
He's got immunity. He's untouchable.

46:44.652 --> 46:46.672
He can't get away with this.
No, he can't.

46:48.684 --> 46:49.716
What are you suggesting?

46:51.696 --> 46:53.668
I don't know if I can trust you.

46:55.724 --> 46:58.671
If it comes to saving
the life of a 15-year-old girl,

46:58.672 --> 46:59.736
then yes, you can.

47:01.716 --> 47:03.696
It's got to be done right.

47:04.704 --> 47:07.680
He's smart.
He won't be taken in easily.

47:10.660 --> 47:14.735
You'll get involved when you're
on call as Duty Inspector.

47:14.736 --> 47:18.675
No. There are other parties
interested in him.

47:18.676 --> 47:22.647
The less you know, the better,
for your own good.

47:22.648 --> 47:25.683
You'll get the information you need
about the girl.

47:25.684 --> 47:29.707
After that...
do you care what happens to him?

47:29.708 --> 47:31.732
Do you? Really?

47:36.684 --> 47:38.732
And obviously we can help you
in other ways.

47:41.652 --> 47:42.932
Don't tell me you don't need it.

47:46.716 --> 47:48.655
No.

47:48.656 --> 47:50.720
We're already
involved in this together, Lindsay.

47:53.700 --> 47:59.695
There'll be a nice, calm, orderly
handover of the witness.

47:59.696 --> 48:02.707
No heroics. Definitely no guns.

48:02.708 --> 48:05.679
Everybody walks away.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.684
Everybody wins.

48:09.664 --> 48:11.739
But before I leave here tonight...

48:11.740 --> 48:15.736
I need the reassurance that you have
got as much to lose as I do.

48:18.704 --> 48:19.724
Take the money.

48:24.648 --> 48:25.680
Enjoy it.

48:45.664 --> 48:46.688
She's in.

48:47.696 --> 48:49.683
She want to know names?

48:49.684 --> 48:51.647
No.

48:51.648 --> 48:52.656
Good.

48:53.696 --> 48:55.668
Good for her.

49:03.740 --> 49:06.676
'All that money getting me in here.'

49:07.704 --> 49:10.647
You've got your own life
to think of.

49:10.648 --> 49:11.688
No. Mum, don't.

49:13.736 --> 49:16.659
My life's finished. Don't say that.

49:16.660 --> 49:17.712
I have to say it.

49:19.676 --> 49:23.668
You've got to live yours,
before it passes you by.

49:55.732 --> 49:57.716
Fuck this.

50:01.704 --> 50:03.663
What's she playing at?

50:03.664 --> 50:05.688
What's happening? I don't know.

50:20.680 --> 50:22.664
No!

51:01.740 --> 51:03.708
Shit.

51:04.708 --> 51:06.648
Shit.

52:38.652 --> 52:39.704
Anything to say, ma'am?

52:48.652 --> 52:49.684
Hello, Inspector.

52:50.740 --> 52:54.667
There were interesting findings on
Sergeant O'Neill's computer.

52:54.668 --> 52:56.711
You used it to get
information on Tommy Hunter,

52:56.712 --> 52:59.691
a full two weeks before the ambush.

52:59.692 --> 53:01.643
O'Neill's lying.

53:01.644 --> 53:03.707
He was the one that was
in on the conspiracy, not me.

53:03.708 --> 53:05.655
You told me he wasn't.

53:05.656 --> 53:07.727
In fact, you made a point
of directing me away from him

53:07.728 --> 53:10.736
as a line of inquiry -
to stop us checking his computer.

53:12.704 --> 53:14.688
Come upstairs, ma'am.

53:21.619 --> 53:23.739
You also made a special point
of personally collecting

53:23.740 --> 53:25.687
your mum's belongings.

53:25.688 --> 53:28.707
You even mentioned them straight
after you found out she was dead.

53:28.708 --> 53:31.676
Strange it'd be the first thing
you'd think of.

53:32.704 --> 53:34.676
Open the overnight bag.

53:38.688 --> 53:40.648
Unzip the compartment.

53:44.700 --> 53:47.727
Lindsay Denton, we're hereby
returning you to custody.

53:47.728 --> 53:50.684
Who are you two to judge me?

53:53.648 --> 53:54.712
You don't know me.

54:05.732 --> 54:07.663
Well done, you two.

54:07.664 --> 54:09.679
Thanks, sir. Well done. Thanks, sir.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.727
Yeah. Top job, the pair of you.
Cheers, Dot.

54:11.728 --> 54:15.703
Dot, your report on the Caddy -
that's coming along OK, yeah?

54:15.704 --> 54:19.647
Yes, it is, sir.
That Cole was a nasty piece of work.

54:19.648 --> 54:20.731
Wish I could finish the job.

54:20.732 --> 54:23.699
Still, I expect that'll go to
my replacement now, eh?

54:23.700 --> 54:27.643
I've been meaning to say,
your secondment from AC-9,

54:27.644 --> 54:28.703
you fitted in really well.

54:28.704 --> 54:30.703
How would you like to make
that permanent?

54:30.704 --> 54:33.644
What can I say, sir? I'm your man.

54:34.688 --> 54:35.704
Good lad.

54:54.696 --> 54:56.663
Want another?

54:56.664 --> 54:57.676
Yeah, go on.

55:05.712 --> 55:08.695
It's fine.
We can do this another time.

55:08.696 --> 55:10.663
You going to go home?

55:10.664 --> 55:12.648
I'll sort something out.

55:18.720 --> 55:21.704
You all right? Yeah.
Shall we get going?

55:26.660 --> 55:27.700
Look...

55:28.704 --> 55:31.736
This is great.
Can we do it tomorrow night?

55:35.668 --> 55:36.680
Sure.

55:53.652 --> 55:56.692
Excuse me.
Can we have the same again, please?

58:07.955 --> 58:40.042
