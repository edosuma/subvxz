WEBVTT

00:07.880 --> 00:11.828
Chopper One, we have
a report of a body in Presidio Park.

00:11.830 --> 00:14.207
Chopper One copy. En route.

00:14.210 --> 00:18.988
SAN FRANCISCO, CA

00:29.670 --> 00:32.321
Confirming dead body.
Male, mid-30$, badly beaten.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.412
Single gunshot to the head.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.205
Well?

00:41.460 --> 00:45.203
We need to call the FBI.
It's starting again.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.991
You hungry

00:55.000 --> 00:59.323
-Don't try and act like you care.
-I just want to know if you're hungry.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.070
No. I'm not hungry.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.378
I'm not the enemy, Jane.

01:06.380 --> 01:09.577
Of course not. My friends are, right?
And David.

01:09.580 --> 01:13.869
You're 14.
It's too young to go on dates,

01:13.880 --> 01:17.031
especially with a boy
who's already driving.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.531
Mom thinks you work too much.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.280
What does that have to do
with anything?

01:21.290 --> 01:23.201
It's not my fault
that you two don't get along.

01:23.210 --> 01:27.169
-I'm not saying it is.
-No, you're just trying to ship me off.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.957
-Your mom and I love you.
-Don't even.

01:33.250 --> 01:37.289
Okay. You want to be treated
like an adult? Fine.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.952
Can I help you?

01:43.960 --> 01:48.454
What do you think is going on
with the helicopters tonight?

01:48.460 --> 01:51.076
I'm sorry, I'm trying to have
a conversation with my daughter.

01:54.460 --> 01:56.416
I wasn't talking to you.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.279
I was talking to Jane.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.456
How do you know my daughter's name?

02:03.460 --> 02:04.950
You're not in charge here.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.911
-Jane, run ahead.
-No.

02:12.170 --> 02:13.614
Now, you come quiet...

02:15.790 --> 02:16.870
Or you both die.

02:29.290 --> 02:32.202
WASHINGTON, D.C.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.457
-Hotch.
-Cooper.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.241
You never were one for offices.

03:05.710 --> 03:08.827
Medical condition.
I'm allergic to bureaucracy.

03:09.830 --> 03:11.491
Thanks for coming, Hotch.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.070
Sure. I don't have long.
We're leaving on a case.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.072
I know. San Francisco. I hear things.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.286
So what's going on?

03:17.290 --> 03:19.372
How much do you know
about this case you're working?

03:19.380 --> 03:21.746
I'm on my way in to look at the files.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.241
-Can I give you a preview?
-Sure.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.821
All right, so here's the deal.

03:28.330 --> 03:33.165
Two years ago, a dead male
turned up in Presidio Park.

03:33.170 --> 03:35.320
Massive amount of blunt force trauma,

03:35.830 --> 03:40.073
defensive wounds, single gunshot
to the back of the head.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.039
And over the next three days,
three more vics, same MO.

03:44.040 --> 03:48.454
And after that, there was nothing.
Until exactly one year later.

03:48.460 --> 03:52.874
Same thing. Dead male, badly beaten,
shot execution-style,

03:52.880 --> 03:55.371
followed by three more vics
over the next three days.

03:55.380 --> 03:58.326
-And then nothing until last night.
-One year later. Exactly.

03:58.330 --> 04:02.073
Which means we have three days
before the trail goes cold again.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.206
Why all the interest?

04:04.500 --> 04:09.620
I got a theory. I think there are
parallel murders linked to these cases.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.532
Two years ago,
one day after those murders stopped,

04:12.540 --> 04:15.612
a single dad and his 15-year-old
brunette daughter

04:15.620 --> 04:16.780
were found dead in their car.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.412
Last year, again,

04:21.210 --> 04:24.611
one day after the dead males
stopped showing up, same thing.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.747
Another dad and his brunette daughter.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.320
And you think it's all connected?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.957
I think it's a hell of a coincidence,
don't you?

04:29.960 --> 04:32.030
And you want me to bring your team in
on the case.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.371
You only have three days.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.610
I mean, you don't have time
to go chasing an angle like this one.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.417
So, my team works the bodies
in Presidio Park

04:37.420 --> 04:39.661
while your team tests the theory
about the fathers and daughters.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.321
And if I'm right, both halves of the case
help solve the other half.

04:42.330 --> 04:44.412
And you already asked the director,
and she said no.

04:44.420 --> 04:47.492
She is not strong
at thinking outside the box.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.037
You ignore her order and you're wrong,
you're done.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.577
I'm telling you, Hotch.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.322
Right now there's a father
and there's a daughter

04:55.330 --> 04:58.879
and they're missing,
and no one is looking for them.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.209
-Stop it. Stop it!
-I can snap this chain.

05:07.210 --> 05:09.826
-You're just gonna hurt yourself.
-No.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.913
Stop it. Please, please!
Please just stop it! Stop!

05:12.920 --> 05:14.035
Are you okay?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.029
Stop.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.740
You stay away from her.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.116
I said get away from her.

05:27.710 --> 05:30.452
-What the hell do you want?
-It's simple.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.530
You give her to me,

05:35.830 --> 05:37.377
you both live.

05:38.710 --> 05:40.166
Go to hell.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.536
If that's your answer.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.788
Mother Teresa said,
"I have found the paradox,

06:35.790 --> 06:39.954
"that if you love until it hurts,
there can be no more hurt,

06:39.960 --> 06:41.575
"only more love."

06:43.670 --> 06:45.661
What do we know _
about the past years' Victims?

06:45.670 --> 06:47.615
The Tenderloin district
has a high concentration

06:47.620 --> 06:50.498
of drug addicts and homeless people.
All the victims have been transients.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.991
So, this UnSub's choosing
easy targets that won't be missed.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.241
He's not concerned
with the challenge of the hunt.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.820
All these victims
are part of a larger plan.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.492
Which he executes
on the same few days every year.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.491
Reid, did you find any significance
to the dates?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.616
Nothing historical.
It's gotta be personal for the UnSub.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.997
JJ, you and Reid
head to San Francisco PD.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.161
Rossi and Prentiss to the dump site.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.320
Morgan and I will go
to the coroner's office.

07:11.330 --> 07:14.413
Nobody should expect to get
a lot of sleep for the next three days.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.820
What about Cooper's team?
You said he had a theory.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.878
He believes that whoever's murdering
these homeless men

07:18.880 --> 07:20.745
is also abducting fathers and daughters

07:20.750 --> 07:23.287
and killing them
once the transients are disposed of.

07:23.290 --> 07:24.951
So then we'll investigate the dead men,

07:24.960 --> 07:28.032
_ and _his_ team can see if there
IS a mIssmg father and daughter.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.031
Why isn't his team on the jet now?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.747
Because th_e_di_rector wouldn't authorize
them jomlng the Investigation.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.207
They're working against
the director's orders?

07:35.210 --> 07:38.111
We need to concentrate on the dead
men abducted from the Tenderloin.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.827
Cooper's team can help determine
if there's a missing father and daughter

07:40.830 --> 07:42.491
and whether it's connected to our case.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.786
Or you could get in serious hot water

07:44.790 --> 07:46.951
if the director thinks
you're helping to defy her.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.780
No. Hotch is right.

07:48.790 --> 07:52.703
I've known Sam Cooper for 20 years
and I've never seen him defy an order.

07:52.710 --> 07:57.454
If he feels this strong about a hunch,
we need to help him however we can.

08:09.710 --> 08:12.281
Sam Cooper
Supervisory Special Agent

08:12.290 --> 08:14.030
B.A.U. Team Leader

08:15.250 --> 08:17.286
Jonathan "Prophet" Simms
Supervisory Special Agent,

08:17.290 --> 08:18.279
Supervisory Special Agent, Pending

08:22.290 --> 08:24.076
Mick Rawson
Supervisory Special Agent

08:27.170 --> 08:31.322
-Trying to get out of the heavy lifting?
-Actua|ly, I'm setting up a two-way iLNB

08:31.330 --> 08:32.410
Gina LaSalle
Supervisory Special Agent

08:32.420 --> 08:35.241
with a BOO-megawatt transmitter
and single-polarity LNB,

08:35.250 --> 08:37.571
both operating in the Ku bands.

08:41.170 --> 08:42.956
What did she just say to me?

08:42.960 --> 08:44.951
At least w_e're blessed
With a nice setup.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.279
How'd you hook it up?

08:46.290 --> 08:47.917
I know a guy
who knows a guy

08:47.920 --> 08:50.616
who knows a slumlord
who gave us a great deal.

08:50.620 --> 08:53.578
So, how do we conjure victims
of a crime

08:53.580 --> 08:57.164
that might not have been committed
out of thin air in a major American city?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.990
San Francisco has
a population of 800,000.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.039
Half of those are males.
Just start with the females.

09:03.540 --> 09:07.112
Only 45% of the population is white,
so what does that leave?

09:07.120 --> 09:10.783
That gets us to 180,000.

09:10.790 --> 09:14.612
Check school absences.
Narrow that to girls 13 to 18

09:14.620 --> 09:16.167
and narrow it again to brunettes.

09:16.710 --> 09:19.247
Find their fathers' names
and check their workplaces.

09:19.620 --> 09:20.871
Who hasn't shown up?

09:20.880 --> 09:24.202
Well, okay,
if you want to show off about it.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.919
All right. That's right.
Let's get to work.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.536
Have all the dump sites
been this isolated?

09:37.540 --> 09:38.916
Presidio Park
SAN FRANCISCO

09:38.920 --> 09:41.992
He keeps away from the main paths.
Never dumps them in lighted areas.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.956
So, he had to have studied
the terrain beforehand.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.075
He's organized.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.618
And physical enough to haul a body
a long way on his own.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.110
What can you tell us
about the victims?

09:50.580 --> 09:54.038
They were all living on the streets.
No witnesses.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.032
Our guess is he managed
to lure them, promising food or drugs.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.496
Were any reported missing?

09:58.500 --> 10:02.072
No. We do know they all came from
the same few blocks in the Tenderloin.

10:04.380 --> 10:06.951
This is the body they found
at Presidio Park.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.166
If he hadn't been shot,

10:08.170 --> 10:10.070
he probably would have died
of internal bleeding.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.287
It looks like he landed
a few shots of his own.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.326
There's powder residue on his skull.

10:16.330 --> 10:19.822
He had to have been subdued
when he was shot.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.206
So, he gets abducted off the street,

10:21.210 --> 10:23.246
quietly enough
that there's no witnesses,

10:23.250 --> 10:24.410
but then he fights for his life,

10:24.420 --> 10:26.536
only to let the UnSub shoot him
execution-style?

10:26.540 --> 10:30.112
In other words,
what the hell's he doing with them?

10:43.460 --> 10:45.109
Unlock him.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.575
- -Not yet.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.876
Get up. Let's go.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.571
Throw the key off to the side.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.662
You win, you live.

11:14.670 --> 11:18.743
You lose, I kill your daughter,
and I kill you.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.819
Understand?

12:16.790 --> 12:18.075
Can you stand?

12:19.960 --> 12:22.030
Can you stand?

12:23.790 --> 12:25.781
Don't look, Jane.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.030
Okay, we've talked
to over 200 middle schools

12:38.040 --> 12:41.248
and ran the names of absent girls
against their yearbook photos.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.376
And what else?

12:42.380 --> 12:45.110
We're checking bios of the dads now
and calling their workplaces.

12:45.880 --> 12:49.327
So he hasn't been at work. You're sure?

12:49.330 --> 12:51.992
Both days? Thank you.

12:52.830 --> 12:53.876
What do we got?

12:56.960 --> 12:59.918
This is Jane McBride. She's 14.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.876
She didn't show up for school
yesterday or this morning.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.319
And Dad?

13:04.330 --> 13:07.959
Ben. He hasn't been at his contracting
company for the last two days.

13:09.170 --> 13:10.489
I love this guy.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.281
And the Prophet speaks. Yes. Yes.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.321
Hotch. Cooper.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.206
I think we found them.

13:42.670 --> 13:45.070
Mrs McBride?
I'm Agent Hotchner with the FBI.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.616
-This is Agent Cooper.
-We're here to determine

13:46.620 --> 13:48.247
whether your husband
and your daughter are missing.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.377
-No, don't.
-Ma'am

13:50.380 --> 13:53.497
Just get inside, please. Hurry.

13:58.540 --> 13:59.575
Oh, God.

14:01.460 --> 14:05.373
-Mrs McBride?
-You just got my family murdered.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.115
That's the first victim from the park.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.533
The man on the phone said he'd kill
Ben and Jane if I brought in the police.

14:27.540 --> 14:31.249
He said that if I needed proof,
I should check my front porch.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.070
And when I did, this was there.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.991
He's careful.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.662
Nothing to distinguish him
or his location.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.572
-Were there any other instructions?
-No. He said he'd call with more.

14:44.290 --> 14:48.829
Do you think he's watching

14:48.830 --> 14:50.457
This video was shot
by a camera on a tripod,

14:50.460 --> 14:52.325
which means
he probably doesn't have a partner.

14:52.330 --> 14:55.117
It'd be almost impossible for him
to take your family prisoner

14:55.120 --> 14:59.489
-and do surveillance simultaneously.
-And he's done this before?

14:59.500 --> 15:02.412
So why didn't someone come forward
after to say what happened?

15:04.830 --> 15:06.957
He doesn't leave anybody
with knowledge alive.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.611
And we'll post an agent here
to keep you safe.

15:09.620 --> 15:12.032
Can you excuse us a moment?

15:12.040 --> 15:14.827
Cooper, listen. Your theory's right.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.879
We know he's killing homeless men,
as well as fathers and daughters.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.327
But let us work it.
If you go back to D.C. now,

15:21.330 --> 15:23.161
the director won't know
that you Ignored her order.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.377
Look, I know you're sticking
your neck out on this thing for me.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.029
I understand. I don't...
I'm not tryIng to...

15:27.040 --> 15:30.328
This isn't about me.
I want to protect you.

15:35.620 --> 15:39.989
Do you remember him?
-Colby Holme. Of course.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.779
You remember, we got that confession

15:41.790 --> 15:46.705
for those five child murders,
but we all had that gut feeling.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.247
We knew he wasn't good for all
of them. The preference was too varied.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.457
Local cops shut the investigation down.

15:51.460 --> 15:55.169
FBI brass, they told us
to get our asses back home.

15:56.830 --> 16:00.072
I remember.
-Where were you when you heard

16:00.080 --> 16:02.457
they caught that second killer
dumping this boy's body?

16:02.460 --> 16:04.451
I was in Denver working a new case.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.575
You?

16:06.580 --> 16:10.164
I wasn't on anything yet.
I could have still been there.

16:12.880 --> 16:17.453
I won't ignore my gut again.
I don't care what it costs me.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.786
Okay.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.576
My people will be on the record
and we'll use yours

16:22.580 --> 16:23.706
-to double _manpower.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.372
Hotchner. Where?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.201
Okay. They found another body.

16:36.210 --> 16:41.079
Crime Scene
PRESIDIO PARK

16:41.080 --> 16:43.457
-So how does a Brit...
-A handsome Brit?

16:43.460 --> 16:46.497
How does a Brit end up in the FBI?

16:46.500 --> 16:50.209
It's pretty simple. Cooper and I
bumped into each other a few times.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.667
Ten months ago, they told him
he could hand-pick a new team.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.537
He called, I came.
Passport didn't matter.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.575
Huh...

16:57.210 --> 17:01.374
So, is it true that no one
in the British Special Forces

17:01.380 --> 17:02.870
is allowed to admit they're in it?

17:02.880 --> 17:05.531
I don't know.
I'd have to ask around about that one.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.377
You know, there's a lot of rumors
about your boss.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.950
-Yeah?
-One I heard was,

17:10.960 --> 17:15.169
when he left the BAU, he was doing
psychological ops overseas.

17:15.170 --> 17:18.071
Well, I've never been big on rumors.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.668
So, I don't suppose
you're gonna tell me

17:20.670 --> 17:23.070
just where you two
bumped into each other?

17:25.920 --> 17:28.070
I'll tell you I trust the man
with my life.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.411
I'll tell you I'd die for the man.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.035
How's the mom?

17:40.040 --> 17:43.703
She's holding up. I don't know
how much help she's gonna be.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.782
So, the Tenderloin is full of
junkies who'd be easy to control,

17:46.790 --> 17:49.247
but the first victim
had no drugs in his system,

17:49.250 --> 17:51.707
and this geezer,
he looks pretty healthy, too.

17:52.460 --> 17:54.781
Except for the whole dead thing.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.576
He has skin under his nails.

18:03.710 --> 18:06.326
Didn't the first victim
have scratch marks on his chest?

18:06.330 --> 18:09.037
Yeah, we assumed he fought back
against the UnSub,

18:09.040 --> 18:12.703
but these victims might actually
be fighting each other.

18:12.710 --> 18:14.450
Exactly.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.577
I take it you're about to wow me
with a theory.

18:17.580 --> 18:22.199
The first victim is dumped before the
fathers and daughters are taken. Why?

18:22.210 --> 18:24.997
'Cause he wants to send a message
to the wife that he means business.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.410
Make sure she doesn't call the police.

18:26.420 --> 18:29.958
And it also sends a message
to the prisoners he already has.

18:29.960 --> 18:34.499
You lose a fight, you die.
What do those welts look like to you?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.877
My guess?
They're wounds from rubber bullets.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.075
Like they use to control rioters
or prison inmates.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.459
-Okay.
-I think the UnSub's been locked up.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.168
It's where he's learned
to control hIS own prisoners.

18:45.170 --> 18:48.071
Well, if he's learned how to dominate
them, why are they fighting each other?

18:48.080 --> 18:49.707
It has to be a part of his plan.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.496
To watch them
beat the hell out of each other.

18:51.500 --> 18:57.530
-And then the loser is executed.
-AdmIt It. I'm starting to grow on you.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.036
Hotch, it's Emily. We have an idea

19:01.040 --> 19:02.416
about what he might be doing
with the victims.

19:02.420 --> 19:05.036
We may be able to give the profile.
Hold on a second.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.246
Hey, who are you calling?

19:06.250 --> 19:09.538
If I'm right, there's somewhere else
we need to be delivering that profile.

19:13.120 --> 19:17.910
SAN QUENTIN PRISON

19:18.580 --> 19:20.411
This is one for the books, huh?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.285
Yeah.
You spend much time here?

19:22.290 --> 19:27.956
-Maybe a half a dozen interviews. You?
-Six years, three months, four days.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.918
-The Prophet returns.
-What up, man

19:46.920 --> 19:48.535
This is Nelson G.

19:48.540 --> 19:50.917
Me and him know each other
from back in the dark days.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.497
Never expect
I'd ever see you in here again.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.413
-This is Agent David Rossi, FBI.
-FBI?

19:58.420 --> 20:01.492
First time I see you in how long
and you bring the FBI?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.872
Get the hell out of here!

20:05.880 --> 20:08.667
I told you, man,
if I ever got my shot at redemption,

20:08.670 --> 20:11.161
I was gonna take my game
to the other side.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.662
"To open the blind eye, to take
the prisoner out the prison and..."

20:14.670 --> 20:17.662
"And them that sit in darkness
out of the prison house."

20:18.670 --> 20:20.285
Makes sense, I guess.

20:21.330 --> 20:23.070
Criminals are the ones
who make the rules, right?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.570
Cops are the ones
who gotta learn them.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.070
I need your help, man.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.377
Let's talk.

20:31.380 --> 20:35.248
We have a serial killer. We think
he might have done time here.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.786
We want to give you a description,

20:36.790 --> 20:38.826
and then you tell us
if you recognize him.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.912
Just press your connections.

20:42.330 --> 20:44.821
It's very likely that this UnSub
has a prison record.

20:44.830 --> 20:47.663
He's white, and judging by the age
of the people he abducts,

20:47.670 --> 20:49.490
most likely in his 305.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.877
And considering the terrain
in which he's dumping the bodies,

20:51.880 --> 20:54.781
we think that he's imposing,
or at least very physically fit.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.781
He also has access to a space
that's large enough

20:56.790 --> 20:58.701
to house and _control
a number of prisoners,

20:58.710 --> 21:00.701
all without disturbing the neighbors.

21:00.710 --> 21:04.874
This guy keeps to the same
hunting ground, same dump site.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.031
He's a control freak. Real organized.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.452
Also, he would have been obsessed
with the guards

21:10.460 --> 21:14.032
and their methods of controlling
the prisoners, especially in the yard.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.417
This dude kills folks
the same few days every year.

21:16.420 --> 21:19.821
There's no way he's that obsessed
and he's not talking about it.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.076
We think the man
has a daughter of his own,

21:22.080 --> 21:23.661
most likely a brunette, like Jane.

21:23.670 --> 21:25.991
The dates he chooses
probably correspond to an event

21:26.000 --> 21:27.240
involving his own daughter.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.241
Our guess is that he lost his daughter
in some way,

21:29.250 --> 21:31.571
and it's symbolic of him
not fighting for her in the first place.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.411
A lot of times, killers choose

21:33.420 --> 21:35.069
victims that are surrogates
for someone,

21:35.080 --> 21:40.074
like a wife or a mother.
In this case, we think his own guilt

21:40.080 --> 21:42.913
is making him choose surrogates
that represent himself.

21:57.290 --> 21:58.826
Police department has the profile.

21:58.830 --> 22:00.491
They've tripled patrols
in the Tenderloin.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.071
You know what?
I think we need profilers out here, too.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.412
He could be out here hunting
for homeless men to fight the father.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.668
This kid? Best sniper I've ever seen.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.531
He could view a lot of ground
from the rooftop.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.076
You're comfortable on the ground solo?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.320
Cooper's right.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.412
Maybe we can catch him
trying to abduct another victim.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.747
TEN DERLOIN DISTRICT

22:32.710 --> 22:35.031
So, what you wearing?

22:38.620 --> 22:39.826
A gun.

22:40.750 --> 22:44.163
Hey, Mick. Explain something to me.
How come I'm out on the street,

22:44.170 --> 22:46.491
and you're sitting on your butt
on some roof?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.661
Well, you heard the man.

22:48.670 --> 22:52.743
Do you really want me to expound
on my own prowess? It's undignified.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.035
Stay on your headset.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.201
All his victims are coming
from this four-block radius.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.661
Jane. Jane.
You need to save your strength.

23:10.290 --> 23:13.418
-You can't fight again.
-I don't have a choice.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.412
I don't care if they break
every bone in my body,

23:17.420 --> 23:19.786
I promise you I'm not gonna stop.

23:28.790 --> 23:32.374
Okay, I've got something.
I'm not sure if it's anything,

23:32.380 --> 23:36.282
but southeast corner.
See the guy clocking the junkie?

23:38.290 --> 23:40.918
Care to expand on that?
All I see are guys clocking junkies.

23:43.460 --> 23:44.529
Grey shirt.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.451
Yeah, I got him.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.576
Stay close. I'm on my way.

23:52.460 --> 23:56.203
He's heading southbound. FBI! Stop!

24:23.960 --> 24:24.995
Hey!

24:35.170 --> 24:36.569
Stop!

24:36.580 --> 24:38.536
-I didn't do anything!
-Why were you following that man?

24:38.540 --> 24:40.872
I knew that he was holding.
I just wanted a fix.

24:45.170 --> 24:46.376
I don't distribute.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.167
Dad!

25:27.330 --> 25:28.615
Why keep this up?

25:28.620 --> 25:30.872
She's better off with me.
We both know it.

25:32.460 --> 25:35.111
Soon, this will be all she knows.

25:39.710 --> 25:42.918
You let her walk home from school
every day on her own.

25:43.580 --> 25:47.118
She'll be safe with me, Ben.
She won't even miss you.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.207
You won't break me!

25:58.420 --> 26:00.240
That's to the death.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.662
To the death. Or I kill Jane.

26:11.330 --> 26:14.117
To the death, or Jane dies.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.786
Last chance.

26:32.920 --> 26:33.955
I'm so sorry.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.239
I'm sorry.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.076
I'm so sorry.

26:54.250 --> 26:57.322
-Did your analyst get us the data?
-Yeah. I can lay it out for you.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.662
Good. Let's cross-reference it
against our potential suspect pool.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.702
Hello? Yeah, we can be there.

27:04.330 --> 27:07.572
You up for a ride to San Quentin?

27:07.580 --> 27:10.743
It's like the old days. Spending
all your time interviewing prisoners.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.820
Don't go getting sentimental on me.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.490
What we got?

27:16.500 --> 27:20.322
The profile says he spent time in prison
and probably lost a teenage daughter

27:20.330 --> 27:23.379
in a way that corresponds to the dates
he abducts and kills his victims.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.247
We have the dates in question
divided into four specific subsets.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.457
This group is teenage girls
aged 13 to 16

27:28.460 --> 27:30.109
who were removed
from their father's care.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.872
These are deaths of teenagers
the same age.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.950
The remainder are men
arrested for Violent crimes

27:33.960 --> 27:35.951
and anyone serving a prison sentence
during the same window.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.700
-His stressor's in _here somewhere.

27:37.710 --> 27:39.109
Let's find something
that looks promising

27:39.120 --> 27:41.076
_ so we can start
running background checks.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.076
-Agent Hotchner, Erin Strauss.-Yes, ma'am.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.241
I'm calling to check
on the status of your case.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.287
We're pursuing a secondary line
of investigation.

27:54.290 --> 27:57.532
-And why is that?
-Let me talk to her for a second.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.377
Hold a moment, please.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.996
Do you think I'm stupid, Agent Cooper?

28:08.710 --> 28:11.668
No, ma'am. I do not think you're stupid.

28:11.670 --> 28:13.740
Is it unclear when I give an order?

28:15.250 --> 28:18.663
You should know that Agent Hotchner,
he had nothing to do with this.

28:18.670 --> 28:22.288
We need to be invited in by the locals.
You weren't.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.497
You do realize that my theory was right.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.412
-I want you back here today.-I can't do that.

28:27.420 --> 28:30.492
_ -Excuse me? _
-You can fire me tomorrow. Right now,

28:30.500 --> 28:32.661
I've got less than 24 hours
before a father and a daughter

28:32.670 --> 28:34.319
turn up dead somewhere in the city,

28:34.330 --> 28:35.877
and I refuse to be on an airplane

28:35.880 --> 28:37.450
while the son of a bitch
dumps their bodies.

28:37.750 --> 28:43.245
Now, with all possible respect,
I gotta go. I've got work to do.

28:43.620 --> 28:47.738
Tell Agent Hotchner I will deal
with the both of you when you get back.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.489
So, where were we?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.668
I want you to get inside
the girl's head. She's the key.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.787
Any insight can help break this thing.

29:04.790 --> 29:08.374
We need to understand _
why he took this girl at this time.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.457
I asked around about you.

29:38.460 --> 29:39.950
Is it true
you interviewed Charles Manson

29:39.960 --> 29:41.575
before they transferred him out of here?

29:41.580 --> 29:43.787
Three straight days, 1988.

29:45.290 --> 29:46.917
What was he like?

29:47.920 --> 29:48.989
Small.

29:50.210 --> 29:52.997
-Small, huh

29:53.000 --> 29:56.117
-I heard a story.
-What kind of story?

29:56.120 --> 29:58.668
There's this big white dude
that was in before I got sent back.

29:58.670 --> 30:02.379
Supposedly he's all kinds of crazy.
He finds out his daughter died,

30:02.380 --> 30:03.916
he goes all commando.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.662
Boxing, working out,
challenging everyone in the yard,

30:06.670 --> 30:08.490
saying that he'd fight them to the death.

30:09.750 --> 30:14.164
-Sounds like it could be your guy?
-Yeah. Keep talking.

30:14.170 --> 30:18.379
Story is, it got so bad that he started
to beef with the officers here,

30:18.380 --> 30:20.325
and they finally put him
in solitary confinement

30:20.330 --> 30:23.959
-to serve out the rest of his term.
-You got a name?

30:34.040 --> 30:35.610
What are you doing?

30:35.620 --> 30:39.909
Force of habit. My dad was Army.
In my house, we marched.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.787
-He must be proud of you.
-All he knew was I gave up West Point

30:42.790 --> 30:45.281
for a long shot
of someday getting into the FBI.

30:45.290 --> 30:47.281
Well, Cooper obviously
has a lot of faith in you.

30:47.290 --> 30:50.032
He plucked you out
of the Academy, right?

30:52.380 --> 30:54.029
What is it?

30:54.040 --> 30:59.535
This collage. Jane is telling her parents
that they don't exist in her life,

30:59.540 --> 31:03.078
that her interests are an entirely
different culture than her parents'.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.913
Why would she keep a journal out
for anyone to read?

31:08.210 --> 31:09.325
What's in it?

31:09.330 --> 31:12.618
It's typical 14-year-old stuff.
Rants about her parents being unfair,

31:12.620 --> 31:14.247
talk about some boy named David.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.992
Okay, so she's defiant
and she wants her parents to read it.

31:19.330 --> 31:21.958
She wouldn't commit these thoughts
to paper in the first place.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.245
Unless it was forced on her.

31:26.960 --> 31:30.418
Your daughter's journal
only goes back nine months.

31:30.420 --> 31:31.876
What made her start keeping it?

31:31.880 --> 31:34.826
We went to a family counselor
who suggested Jane keep it.

31:34.830 --> 31:37.822
-Where was the office?
-In the Tenderloin district.

31:39.460 --> 31:42.247
Okay, got it. Good work, Morgan.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.662
The McBride family went
to a therapy center in the Tenderloin.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.036
The place also did evaluations
for Social Services.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.827
We profiled that the UnSub may have
had his daughter taken away from him.

31:49.830 --> 31:51.206
If he's processed
in the same place

31:51.210 --> 31:53.326
then he would know how to target
the fathers and daughters.

31:53.330 --> 31:55.742
-Can I talk to your analyst?
-Sure.

31:59.580 --> 32:03.539
-Talk to me.
-Penelope Garcia. Sam Cooper.

32:03.540 --> 32:06.282
Sam Cooper! As I live and breathe.

32:06.290 --> 32:09.111
And here I thought you were a story
someone invented. What you got?

32:09.120 --> 32:10.610
Here's what I need from you.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.703
Anyone processed by Social Services
who ended up losing a daughter.

32:13.710 --> 32:17.749
I don't care how big the list is. I can
cross-reference it against my others.

32:17.750 --> 32:22.164
Roger that. I'm gonna hack
like the wind. Prepare to be wowed, sir.

32:27.960 --> 32:31.168
Jane, I need you to listen to me,

32:31.170 --> 32:34.571
'cause it might be the last time
I ever get to talk to you.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.992
I haven't been a good enough father.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.539
You're 14,
you have no idea how terrifying that is.

32:43.540 --> 32:48.079
So I tried to control what you do
and who you see

32:48.080 --> 32:51.664
because I wanted to keep you safe,

32:51.670 --> 32:55.492
and I wanted you to go off to school
and get a good job,

32:56.920 --> 32:58.535
and maybe someday

33:00.670 --> 33:03.992
fall in love,
and ask me to walk you down the aisle.

33:06.170 --> 33:11.870
I'm still your dad,
and it's my job to look out for you.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.991
But I haven't been a good listener.

33:19.540 --> 33:24.318
I know you can hear me,
and I'm not asking you to say anything.

33:24.330 --> 33:28.323
I just want you to know
that I understand

33:28.330 --> 33:30.662
that I can't control everything.

33:34.210 --> 33:36.952
But I need the last words
you hear me say

33:39.040 --> 33:40.746
be that I love you.

33:46.080 --> 33:50.323
All right, my tribe. I have a list
of parents evaluated by Social Services

33:50.330 --> 33:52.878
who ended up losing custody,
but as Cooper predicted,

33:52.880 --> 33:54.575
it is a lengthy tale of woe.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.495
We'll use it to cross_
against the teenage girls

33:56.500 --> 33:57.876
who died _on some of the dates
in question.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.166
I'm gonna start reading names,
you tell me if they're on your list.

34:00.170 --> 34:02.070
Maria Salter, Carla Denny...

34:02.080 --> 34:03.991
-Hey.
-...Joyce Collard, Dawn Sparrow...

34:04.000 --> 34:07.072
Right. Sounds like a possible.
Thanks, Prophet.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.414
We have a name. A John Vincent Bell.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.206
One of the girls who died
was named Mandy Bell.

34:14.210 --> 34:18.283
Garcia, run the name John Vincent
Bell against the family therapy list.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.748
Shazaam. Bell and his wife divorced,
then the wife died,

34:21.750 --> 34:25.379
and Bell was declared incompetent
to have custody of the daughter

34:25.380 --> 34:28.201
-due to a host of mental health issues.
-They got that one right.

34:28.210 --> 34:30.030
Oh, Lord, and then,

34:30.040 --> 34:32.326
when Social Service agents showed up
to remove the girl,

34:32.330 --> 34:35.618
Bel_| beat one of them to death. He was
given seven years for manslaughter.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.611
Yeah, during which time his daughter
was in a car accident.

34:37.620 --> 34:39.747
It looks like she survived
three days on life support,

34:39.750 --> 34:41.240
but eventually died of brain injuries.

34:41.250 --> 34:45.243
Okay, so Bell is making these men
fight to the death, just like he did.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.787
He's trying to prove he did
what any father would do.

34:47.790 --> 34:49.075
Do we have an address?

34:49.080 --> 34:53.369
Uh... The only listing I have is a gym
on Hall Street, in the Tenderloin.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.917
It belongs to Bell's family.
It hasn't been operational for years.

34:55.920 --> 34:56.989
We got him.

34:58.540 --> 35:02.328
I watched Jane's face
when she saw what you did.

35:02.330 --> 35:05.117
I told you, you won't break me.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.533
It doesn't matter. You already lost her.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.877
But if you want to keep fighting...

35:14.000 --> 35:16.286
-He's right.
-Janey?

35:17.540 --> 35:19.451
I want you to take care of me.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.872
-What?
-My dad lied to me.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.074
He was gonna send me away.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.377
-Stop.
-He's a liar.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.280
-Janey, stop.
-I hate you!

35:26.290 --> 35:28.667
I will go anywhere you want.
Just please get me away from him.

35:28.670 --> 35:29.819
-No, she won't!
-Please!

35:29.830 --> 35:33.209
Listen to me. Stop this!
I will kill you, you hear me?

35:33.210 --> 35:37.112
I will track you down and I will kill you!
I will kill you!

35:37.120 --> 35:38.496
I don't think so.

35:38.500 --> 35:42.038
Wait! You said if I go with you,
we both live.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.537
Okay? I need to know
you're not a liar, too.

35:45.540 --> 35:48.247
-Janey.
-Please.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.491
Don't do this.
What are you doing, Jane?

35:51.500 --> 35:52.785
Please.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.953
Janey, please don't do this.
Don't... What are you... Jane!

35:56.960 --> 36:00.873
Janey!Janey!Jane!

36:27.960 --> 36:29.780
JJ. Go.

36:33.710 --> 36:35.917
Watch your step!

36:37.460 --> 36:39.166
Hotch.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.242
I need paramedics immediately
to 631 Hall Street.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.878
-Sir, where's your daughter Jane?
-He took her.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.667
-How long ago?
-Fifteen minutes ago. Find her.

36:57.670 --> 36:58.955
Please find her.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.109
I will.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.417
The place is clear.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.786
-He's on the street. He's got the girl.
-I'll stay with the father.

37:03.790 --> 37:06.372
Garcia. I need vehicle information
for John Vincent Bell.

37:06.380 --> 37:10.783
-Tell police we need an APB.
-Gina? Cooper. You're on the move.

37:10.790 --> 37:13.031
-I can hit the rooftops.
-Good, go.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.166
I need a helicopter.

37:14.170 --> 37:16.741
Garcia, tell San Francisco PD
we need a chopper.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.491
All right, come on.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.609
Look, there. Right there.

38:04.080 --> 38:08.289
We got a visual. Turk and Franklin.
Southeast corner.

38:08.290 --> 38:09.416
We're two blocks away.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.411
Stop! Ow!

38:14.420 --> 38:16.536
-Shut your mouth!
-Ow!

38:16.540 --> 38:19.111
-Don't shine it on the street.
-Then why the hell are we up here?

38:19.120 --> 38:21.782
-Just give me the rooftop.
-He can't escape up there.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.917
This guy was locked alone in a box
for three years.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.036
If he feels trapped,
his animal instincts are gonna kick in,

38:26.040 --> 38:28.326
and he's either gonna try to burrow
or climb his way free.

38:28.330 --> 38:29.706
And since he can't dig
his way out of here,

38:29.710 --> 38:31.200
I guarantee you, he's going to the roof.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.452
Everyone be advised,
he's going to the roof.

38:34.460 --> 38:36.075
He's going to the roof.

38:38.420 --> 38:40.786
-Help me!
-Come on!

38:40.790 --> 38:42.997
Help me! You're hurting me!

38:48.290 --> 38:49.609
This way.

38:55.170 --> 38:56.376
Please.

38:57.670 --> 38:58.785
Come on!

38:58.790 --> 39:01.167
He's headed to the
east corner. We've got him trapped.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.662
John Bell, FBI!

39:12.750 --> 39:15.412
-Put the weapon down!
-Don't shoot me.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.705
Drop the gun!

39:17.830 --> 39:20.321
Keep it on him.
Do not blind my agents.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.076
It's over! Look around you!

39:27.580 --> 39:29.571
Don't do it! Put it down!

39:31.540 --> 39:33.280
You know what it feels like
to lose your daughter.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.417
Do you really want
to hurt somebody else's?

39:43.710 --> 39:44.870
Get off the wall!

40:47.000 --> 40:49.616
Mr McBride, your daughter's here
and your wife's on the way.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.871
Thanks.

40:51.790 --> 40:53.610
They're gonna take him to the hospital.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.497
The paramedics said
he's gonna be okay.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.037
-Can I talk to him?
-Yeah. Of course.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.530
-Baby, hey.
-I'm so sorry.

41:01.540 --> 41:03.246
That's okay.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.206
I didn't mean any of the things
that I said.

41:05.210 --> 41:07.576
-I know.
-You could have died.

41:07.580 --> 41:10.879
-Come here, come here.
-I love you, Daddy.

41:10.880 --> 41:14.611
-I love you, too, honey. So much.
-I love you.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.826
Mom!

41:39.460 --> 41:41.610
Thank you.

41:41.620 --> 41:42.780
You guys want to watch out
for this one.

41:42.790 --> 41:44.530
She's gonna have a hard time
getting over me.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.663
-Like kicking a virus.
-You know, I could have just missed.

41:50.670 --> 41:53.241
With your ego? Not a chance.

41:55.960 --> 41:59.953
-I actually think San Quentin was nicer.
-Yeah, trust me, it's not.

42:00.290 --> 42:01.917
What do you mean?

42:06.920 --> 42:08.911
I think you should have this.

42:14.710 --> 42:19.613
-Wait, what -Her mom gave it to me.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.826
I think it's time you have a reminder

42:20.830 --> 42:22.786
that trusting your gut
has a happy ending.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.700
You did good today.

42:35.330 --> 42:37.378
So you're calling me directly now, huh?

42:37.380 --> 42:38.529
Don't be insolent.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.912
I still plan on reading you
and Agent Hotchner the riot act

42:41.920 --> 42:43.319
when you get back.

42:43.330 --> 42:47.448
Well, that's something
to look forward to.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.746
You did good work.
Now, don't be an idiot.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.241
Get on that jet with his team
and get back home.

42:52.250 --> 42:55.162
-I have a pile of cases for you.
-Yes, ma'am.

42:56.790 --> 42:59.532
So what exactly did she say?

43:00.500 --> 43:03.242
She said that she's gonna buy us
a steak dinner when we get back.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.410
Right.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.612
Thanks for putting yourself
on the line for me.

43:10.620 --> 43:12.952
Anytime. Thanks for being right.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.241
-Toast!
-All right.

43:21.420 --> 43:23.456
Yeah.
