WEBVTT

00:06.132 --> 00:08.300
<i>Everything started
about a year ago.</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:10.511
<i>I was...</i>

00:11.804 --> 00:14.306
<i>doing research
on the perfect cannabis seed.</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:19.937
<i>I don't believe in perfection,
but that's when I said...</i>

00:20.896 --> 00:21.731
<i>wow!</i>

00:22.565 --> 00:23.524
<i>This is it.</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:28.362
<i>I realized then it was time
to take the next step and...</i>

00:29.447 --> 00:31.615
<i>I needed a team for that.</i>

00:34.869 --> 00:36.704
<i>So I called...</i>

00:36.746 --> 00:39.832
<i>Ignacio and... Mariana.</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:46.422
TEN MONTHS EARLIER...

00:49.425 --> 00:52.845
<i>It was her birthday.
She was turning 30.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
<i>So the three of us met up in...</i>

00:57.057 --> 01:00.311
<i>in Bogotá. It was a cold night.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.105
<i>Like every night in Bogotá.</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:08.027
<i>The three of us were
going through...</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:09.653
<i>a particular time in our lives.</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:14.283
<i>And it seemed like...
everything...</i>

01:15.826 --> 01:18.996
<i>everything had been aligned
for the magic to happen.</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:34.970
Do you know what today is?

01:38.724 --> 01:41.894
The day we'll always remember as
the one that changed our lives.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.688
Wow, not even Arjona
would've gone that far.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.900
It's not what I meant but,
anyway.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.903
- It's my birthday, I'm 30.
- What?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.404
- Yes.
- Really?

01:52.446 --> 01:55.491
- Really? You're joking.
- Up to the third level... today.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.451
- Please.
- Thank you!

01:59.036 --> 02:00.079
- Happy birthday!
- Mari, I'm sorry-

02:00.120 --> 02:01.664
- Man!
-...happy birthday.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.999
- What a memory!
- How rude not to remember.

02:05.835 --> 02:07.294
We have to celebrate today.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.713
Can you imagine the day...

02:10.965 --> 02:13.384
when people buy weed
as easily as alcohol?

02:14.885 --> 02:17.304
There can be experts
to help people choose...

02:18.764 --> 02:22.184
what to buy instead of the shit
that somebody grew.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.019
It's not too much to ask.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.145
<i>I think everything's
pointing to that.</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:28.190
That's where we're headed,
inevitably.

02:31.986 --> 02:35.489
Well, guys, let's keep dreaming
later. I have a few calls to make.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.493
I leave you, lovebirds.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.091
It's so nice to see you.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.051
After--

02:56.093 --> 02:58.512
Five years, three months,
and two days.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.140
Are you for real?

03:02.266 --> 03:03.684
Is that true?

03:03.726 --> 03:05.436
It's not, but it sounds nice.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.071
Happy trip around the sun.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.825
You remembered, didn't you?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.161
- You thought I was gonna forget?
- Yes.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.539
After everything we dreamt
about when turning 30?

03:30.294 --> 03:31.587
Wow!

03:33.589 --> 03:34.632
I love it.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.429
Where did you get it?

03:40.471 --> 03:41.347
In Berlin.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.643
Weren't you in Berlin,
like three years ago?

03:46.769 --> 03:47.978
That's right.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.361
It really makes me
happy to see you.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.394
I'm sorry.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.863
Aren't you gonna say anything?

05:20.904 --> 05:22.781
What do you want me to say,
that I'm married?

05:23.866 --> 05:25.075
Is it just because
you're married?

05:25.117 --> 05:27.411
No, Felix, it's not just because
I'm married.

05:27.453 --> 05:28.704
Then why?

05:34.710 --> 05:35.502
Why did you bring me here?

05:36.712 --> 05:38.672
- What do you mean?
- Why did you bring me?

05:38.714 --> 05:40.841
Of all the people you
could've asked

05:40.883 --> 05:43.385
to help you with the business,
why did you pick me?

05:43.427 --> 05:46.930
You've always dreamt about this.
I don't understand the question.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.099
I think you do.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.727
Why me...?

05:51.769 --> 05:54.897
Mari. I let myself go.
It was just a kiss.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.066
- I'm sorry.
- It didn't feel that free, you know?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.944
It felt quite...

06:00.986 --> 06:02.362
planned.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.323
- Planned?
- Yes.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.493
Yes. I feel like you brought me here
just for that.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.626
First of all, I didn't bring you.
You came on your own.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.630
I thought I came to do business,
something serious,

06:19.671 --> 06:22.466
- and be useful at something.
- It's a serious business.

06:22.508 --> 06:26.428
If you think that's not my intention,
blame your fucking paranoia.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.098
Really? My fucking paranoia?

06:29.139 --> 06:31.809
Did I make up what
just happened?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.940
- Okay, it was just a kiss. That's it.
- You bring me to Tayrona--

06:37.981 --> 06:39.650
- First of all, I didn't bring you.
- convincing me.

06:39.691 --> 06:43.821
You get me here by telling me
that I'm the perfect entrepreneur

06:43.862 --> 06:45.989
to help you to take this
business forward.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.325
And it's all bullshit?

06:51.453 --> 06:53.413
I thought you had
grown up by now.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.999
- Hey, eat shit.
- You eat shit!

06:56.041 --> 06:57.876
Do you think this is the right way
to start a business?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.462
I'm not the stupid
little girl anymore.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.237
<i>Felix called and asked me about
the regulations on cannabis.</i>

07:26.864 --> 07:30.033
<i>Then I found out he was planning
on starting a crop company.</i>

07:31.410 --> 07:32.411
<i>That's when I knew
I wanted to be part of it.</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:37.207
<i>Together,</i> <i>we</i> <i>fulfilled</i> <i>all</i> <i>the
requisites</i> <i>for</i> <i>a</i> <i>business.</i>

07:38.458 --> 07:43.547
<i>Transparency, trust, respect...
Clear roles.</i>

07:45.716 --> 07:47.926
<i>It's a plus when you do business
with friends.</i>

07:47.968 --> 07:49.970
<i>Feels more like hanging out
than working.</i>

07:50.012 --> 07:51.513
What's the fucking problem?

07:51.555 --> 07:52.431
Why are you always standing up
for the other side?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.391
HOURS EARLIER

07:54.433 --> 07:56.727
Hey, I have my own point of view. I
don't have to follow other people.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.938
We voted. The decision
to stay with the pharmaceutical

07:59.980 --> 08:02.191
was made as a team.
As the company we are.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.193
- Yes, but it was the wrong decision.
- You don't know that.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.986
Of course, I do.
And you do, too.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.656
This temper tantrum isn't about my
closing a deal with Ilana Frank.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.867
- You just wish it had been you.
- Oh, please.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.911
Mariana, please. I
saved the company.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.329
You should thank me,
not mistreat me.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.206
What should I do?
Bend down, unzip you?

08:17.247 --> 08:18.707
Please, I would love that.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.667
At least I won't be the only one
left hanging here.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.635
<i>Why did I do it?</i>

08:33.388 --> 08:34.723
That's a good question.

08:40.771 --> 08:44.524
Perhaps I thought I could
change things.

08:45.776 --> 08:49.154
<i>Also because... the
flower business...</i>

08:50.030 --> 08:53.325
<i>was really on its way out.</i>

08:56.620 --> 08:57.955
KannaLab, instead,

08:59.498 --> 09:00.916
has all the potential.

09:03.085 --> 09:07.839
<i>When Felix called to tell me,
I...</i>

09:10.467 --> 09:14.054
<i>I thought if I took this chance,</i>

09:14.096 --> 09:16.390
<i>I could save my
family's business.</i>

09:16.431 --> 09:19.101
<i>That this was the
best way possible</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:20.936
<i>to help Rosalía reinvent itself.</i>

09:20.978 --> 09:22.479
But...

09:25.107 --> 09:26.525
I was wrong.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.320
What does your husband do?

09:37.869 --> 09:40.455
What's the purpose of
this interview?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.918
It's too early to know.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.923
Sure, but... KannaLab is what matters.
Our private lives are irrelevant.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.259
Are you behind KannaLab?

09:54.886 --> 09:58.890
A reader who's into this story will
want to know who's behind it and why.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.810
How you came to be.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.940
What does your husband do?

10:08.734 --> 10:13.030
He's CEO of an agricultural
technology equipment company.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.784
What does he think
about your success?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.206
He's always supported me.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.548
ALL ABOUT YOUR BABY

10:31.590 --> 10:33.884
WE'RE WITH YOU EVERY
STEP OF THE WAY

10:33.925 --> 10:36.053
HOW TO BE A BETTER FATHER

10:39.014 --> 10:41.600
On Monday. At what time?

10:43.435 --> 10:45.687
Sure, perfect. I'll step out of
the meeting early.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.649
I went over the inventory.
The numbers seem right,

10:49.691 --> 10:52.611
but we need a second count.
Goodbye.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.321
Hello, Germán.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.532
Yes, on Tuesday I leave for
Shanghai. I'll be at the meeting,

10:57.574 --> 10:59.868
then I travel that night
to Beijing to meet the CEO.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.745
All right.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.383
Have you heard from your wife?

11:15.467 --> 11:17.052
I called her cell phone,
but nothing.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.180
Then I'll let her go in instead.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.641
You're alone, right?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.476
- Yes.
- Come with me, please.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.689
Germán, let me call you in 20,
25 minutes, after I'm done here.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.942
Okay.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.996
I don't have other slots open.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.373
So?

11:47.499 --> 11:49.209
You'll have to make a
new appointment.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.633
When is the next appointment?

11:56.675 --> 11:57.676
Let's see...

11:58.802 --> 12:00.429
It would have to be next month.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.311
ISRAELI MURDERED

12:33.712 --> 12:35.046
<i>Wake up!</i>

13:09.789 --> 13:12.292
Talk to me about the
perfect seed.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.169
What did you do to get it?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.008
It's too technical,
I don't want to bore you.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.259
On the contrary.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.762
Tell me where it all started.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.015
You said it was Bogotá.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.184
<i>At your house or where?</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:37.192
<i>Research shows, in order to get
to a genetically perfect seed,</i>

13:37.234 --> 13:39.444
<i>a lot of experiments
must have been done, right?</i>

13:41.738 --> 13:42.572
Yes.

13:43.949 --> 13:44.783
That's right.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.160
Could you expand on that?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.373
Wake up, Felix!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.542
Can we stop for a moment?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.461
Are you feeling alright, Felix?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.588
<i>-Where are we?
- We're in deep shit.</i>

13:58.630 --> 14:01.550
<i>Let's go, let's go,
let's go right now!</i>

14:11.601 --> 14:14.521
<i>He's dead. We just found him.</i>

14:14.563 --> 14:17.023
<i>-Felix, Felix, Felix!
- Let's go, asshole.</i>

14:17.774 --> 14:19.401
I need a moment.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.078
Hey!

14:30.870 --> 14:31.705
Felix!

14:32.289 --> 14:33.540
Felix!

14:33.582 --> 14:35.125
- Huh?
- Where have you been?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.751
Why?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.838
I've looked everywhere for you.
You won't pick up your phone.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
- I was busy.
- Are you okay?

14:41.923 --> 14:44.551
Yes, I'm great.
Let's talk later, I--

14:44.593 --> 14:45.594
No, hold on.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.513
- No... I can't right now.
- We have a problem, Felix.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.726
- Not now.
- Stop running away, damn it!

14:56.021 --> 14:56.730
About Ignacio.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.108
Did you talk to him?
Did he mention Ilana?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.818
What should we do?
What do you think?

15:01.860 --> 15:04.738
- We should go with Ilana.
- No, no.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.615
- Isn't that what we wanted?
- But not this way.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.408
What the fuck does that matter?

15:11.202 --> 15:12.120
Felix.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.792
Are you coming to work stoned?

15:19.461 --> 15:22.255
This is a serious place, not a
school lab. What's your problem?

15:22.297 --> 15:25.133
What are you talking about,
Mari? I stopped a while ago.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.260
God, it's obvious.
Have you looked in the mirror?

15:27.302 --> 15:29.179
It's your damn problem
whether you believe me or not.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.764
I have enough
problems in my life

15:30.805 --> 15:33.224
without having to deal with the egos
in this company.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.937
And, yeah, this is not a school lab,
with kids whining about the vote.

15:37.979 --> 15:42.025
We're going with Ilana and exporting
what they need to Canada, okay?

15:42.067 --> 15:45.320
I don't want to hear about those damned
pharmaceuticals, enough.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.738
Get over it.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.036
<i>This reminds me of the
first time we met.</i>

15:53.078 --> 15:54.746
You know, I think
about you a lot.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.334
Even when my messages
seem to get lost in the cloud.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.544
I'm recording this, Santamaría.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.423
- My colleagues will listen to this.
- I'm not intimidated by them.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.635
Hi, friends, how are you?
This is Ignacio Santamaría.

16:08.677 --> 16:12.097
I haven't had sex for two weeks, last
time was a passionate night. I remember

16:12.138 --> 16:13.973
- her hand caressing me--
- Let's get on with the interview.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.558
Why won't you see me again?

16:17.227 --> 16:20.063
- I see you right now.
- Not like this. I want you close.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.566
Two weeks without sex turned you
into a reggaeton lyricist?

16:23.608 --> 16:26.528
- Yes, lack of sex damages my brain.
- Can we get back to the interview?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.864
What do you want to know
that you don't already?

16:29.906 --> 16:32.784
What does the Santamaría family think
about your new venture into cannabis?

16:35.620 --> 16:38.665
I'm starting to know you.
I won't let you provoke me.

16:38.707 --> 16:39.249
So?

16:41.042 --> 16:44.003
How does the Santamaría family
feel about your cannabis business?

16:44.045 --> 16:46.381
<i>They'd prefer a dead grandson
to one who grows marijuana.</i>

16:58.184 --> 16:59.978
IN MEMORY OF AUGUSTO SANTAMARÍA.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.063
FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE HIS PASSING.

17:35.764 --> 17:39.476
He must be rolling in his grave
knowing his son is <i>narco</i> .

17:39.517 --> 17:43.062
If that's so, he probably has more
important things to think about.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.315
Don't give me that crap.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.650
Why are you so concerned
with my son's image?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.694
A son's image is very important.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.406
Is it? You should come to give
a talk at the university,

17:53.448 --> 17:56.451
we could talk a bit about image,
you'd learn a lot.

17:56.493 --> 18:00.371
Marta, please.
All I want to learn today

18:00.413 --> 18:02.624
is how to educate my palate
for good wine.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.960
Right. Royal people like you

18:06.002 --> 18:09.255
are always open to good things in
life, except freedom.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.298
Why so much hate towards us?

18:12.008 --> 18:15.303
Sometimes it is difficult to
love people who only have money.

18:16.888 --> 18:17.889
Tell me, how's life going,
Marta?

18:20.016 --> 18:24.062
You're a beautiful woman who's been alone
since you were widowed 15 years ago.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.777
You're not even good
at harassing.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.570
Pathetic.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.209
I'm in the kitchen!

18:49.254 --> 18:50.421
Hi.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.467
What's wrong?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.637
Why didn't you pick
up the phone?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.640
It's in my room.
I didn't want to get distracted.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.143
I'm making the
<i>stracciatella</i> pasta

19:04.185 --> 19:06.855
you love so much. Well,
I'm trying.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.982
We had a date.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.401
Date? Oh...

19:13.653 --> 19:17.115
Don't worry, I'll reschedule it
for tomorrow right away. Okay?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.075
The next availability
is in a month.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.660
Really?

19:20.702 --> 19:21.327
Yes.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.080
I told them that we
would call...

19:24.706 --> 19:26.040
when we can.

19:55.778 --> 19:56.738
Hey.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.533
It's just an appointment.
It's okay.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.289
What is it?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.418
Are we serious about this?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.296
What?

20:13.338 --> 20:14.422
This.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.465
Us.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.718
Of course, it's for real.
What are you saying?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.094
You're just saying that.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.471
I'm not.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.433
Am I pressuring you too much?

20:26.267 --> 20:27.685
I'm seriously asking.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.480
Do you want to build
something with me?

20:32.649 --> 20:35.193
Well, I agreed to that
when we got married, right?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.235
Yes.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.615
But you get married every day
with each new decision you make.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.661
Mariana.

20:45.787 --> 20:49.332
I don't believe family is an
institution or any of that shit.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.084
To me, a family is a team.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.336
How do you feel about it?

20:53.378 --> 20:57.131
I agree with that. But a team that
serves all its members.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.049
I know.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.969
Look. What I need to know...

21:02.804 --> 21:05.723
is if you want to build...

21:05.765 --> 21:08.309
the rest of your life with me.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.103
Together.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.190
You don't have to answer now.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.109
Think about it.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.153
I have to travel to Cartagena...

21:20.071 --> 21:21.030
I don't want to pressure you.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.119
And we can talk when I get back.
What do you think?

21:49.684 --> 21:53.563
SWEETNESS FOR OUR NEW LIFE.
FOR MARI.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.409
So?

22:07.035 --> 22:07.618
How are politics?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.371
Why do you ask about stuff
you don't care about?

22:11.873 --> 22:13.875
What can I talk to you about?
Renaissance philosophy?

22:14.917 --> 22:16.544
Don't fuck with me, Nachito,
okay?

22:16.586 --> 22:19.047
I woke up wanting to kill the
first person standing in my way.

22:19.464 --> 22:22.633
Don't kid yourself.
You're a sheep with a sheepskin.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.052
Are you thinking through
what you're doing?

22:25.511 --> 22:28.056
I may be the only one here
thinking anything through.

22:28.097 --> 22:31.100
You've probably thought about my grandpa's
sleepless nights, all thanks to you.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.813
I know you like to take the
opposing position, and that's fine.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.025
But, sometimes you have to
wonder whether it's worth it.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.069
I get to decide if it's worth it,
right?

22:41.110 --> 22:43.237
Yes, but no man is an island.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.364
Everything you do affects the family,
no matter what.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.741
That's your problem.

22:47.325 --> 22:48.993
I know.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.662
I don't need to remind you there
are advantages and disadvantages

22:51.704 --> 22:53.456
to being part of this family.

22:53.498 --> 22:56.959
Oh, okay. This is when you throw what
the family's done for me in my face.

22:57.001 --> 22:57.794
It depends.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.879
Are you in this family or not?

23:00.797 --> 23:02.298
I already have my own family.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.758
Who? Your business partners?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.303
Ignacio, I thought
you were smarter than that.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.764
Those people have only made moves
behind your back.

23:10.681 --> 23:11.724
Am I supposed to believe you?

23:11.766 --> 23:13.601
No, you don't have to.

23:13.643 --> 23:17.313
As your cousin, it's my duty to tell
you and look after your well-being.

23:17.355 --> 23:21.359
Something tells me you're unaware of
what Madre Verde offered your company.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.319
You're not aware, are you?

23:24.487 --> 23:25.154
What are you talking about?

23:26.280 --> 23:29.242
I was told your
partners had a party

23:29.283 --> 23:31.786
and they made a scene because
the floriculturist's daughter

23:31.828 --> 23:34.205
hadn't told her partner
about the offer.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.374
Everybody knew about it.
Why didn't you?

23:38.543 --> 23:41.379
Ignacio, you're meant to do great
things. Seriously.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.340
It's why we're having this talk.
Let me give you some advice.

23:44.382 --> 23:47.510
Business partners are temporary.
Family is forever.

23:47.552 --> 23:50.012
Business partners take you for granted.
Family won't.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.141
Do you want to be Minister of
Technology? Do you want to reach high?

23:53.724 --> 23:57.270
Well, the whole family is
willing to help pave the way.

23:57.311 --> 24:02.066
First, if you want to. Second, if you
stop being the <i>narco</i> of the family.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.819
You're meant to do great,
important things.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.405
Really. You're too good
to be selling marijuana.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.409
Tell them I'm not interested.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.452
Don't be impulsive.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.706
Think what I just said. Think it through.
We can talk later.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.124
This can give you a fresh
start in life.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.626
- What's up?
- Martica.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.211
Can we go to your place now?

24:22.253 --> 24:23.254
I have a gift for you.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.923
I'm tired of this circus.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.263
Sleep on it.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.503
DELETE

25:07.215 --> 25:08.049
DELETE

25:09.258 --> 25:10.676
DELETE

25:19.769 --> 25:21.062
Mom?

25:23.231 --> 25:24.482
- What happened?
- Nothing.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.818
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a pill.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.489
- What pill, Mom?
- A painkiller.

25:36.661 --> 25:37.828
There's none left.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.459
I have drops that could help.

25:43.501 --> 25:44.502
What drops?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.128
Cannabis oil.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.380
Are you crazy?

25:47.421 --> 25:51.217
I'm not making it up, Eva.
CBD relieves pain.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.594
And I end up red-eyed
the whole damn day like you.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.763
Did you think I didn't notice
what you do in your room?

25:55.805 --> 25:57.556
I'm just trying to help you.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.933
Help yourself first.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.751
Felix won't answer the messages.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.505
We should give him more time,
right?

26:32.216 --> 26:35.011
It must be hard to steal
from your own company.

26:35.553 --> 26:36.554
Steal?

26:37.513 --> 26:41.267
I mean, take cannabis from the
company without permission.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.646
Whatever he has to do is
not my problem.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.441
Not mine, either.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.279
What about your shoes?

26:54.196 --> 26:55.698
It's more comfortable like this.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.576
Are those the same
clothes as yesterday?

27:00.161 --> 27:02.288
I haven't had time to go
home and change.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.085
People are gonna think
we're dating.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.798
They've thought worse
things about me.

27:13.591 --> 27:14.425
Camila.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.304
Felix is your problem.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.800
SWEETNESS FOR OUR NEW LIFE.
FOR MARI.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.853
About Ilana. Thank you.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.109
I was talking to the team,
and...

28:13.150 --> 28:15.361
We're starting
with the delivery right away.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.782
It'll be hard to make the deadlines,
but...

28:20.950 --> 28:22.701
We'll all make it happen.

28:29.792 --> 28:30.793
Is everything okay?

28:36.590 --> 28:39.051
Today is the 15th anniversary
of my dad's death.

28:44.849 --> 28:45.933
Life goes by quickly.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.893
Yes.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.689
You know what I remember often?

28:53.149 --> 28:57.069
One of those images that keep
floating in your mind...

28:58.070 --> 28:59.864
When I was about...

29:00.614 --> 29:01.866
nine,

29:02.658 --> 29:03.909
ten years old.

29:05.703 --> 29:09.039
I was at the beach and my parents
were covering me in sand.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.210
And... You know?
When they bury you--

29:13.252 --> 29:15.171
- Right, they bury you up to here--
-...up to here.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.423
- And you get a mermaid tail.
- Yes.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.051
And I was so happy.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.180
I could see them playing...

29:24.221 --> 29:26.807
covering me.
They were like children.

29:28.559 --> 29:32.605
I became aware that
those two people covering me,

29:32.646 --> 29:34.190
were also the ones who made me.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.568
I existed thanks to them.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.656
If one of them had not existed,

29:44.074 --> 29:45.284
I wouldn't have existed, either.

29:47.077 --> 29:50.247
For 15 years I've wondered
what would my dad have been like

29:52.833 --> 29:54.668
if I hadn't existed?

29:57.046 --> 29:58.380
What would his life
have been like?

29:58.422 --> 29:59.840
Would he be alive?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.222
And if he was,
who would he be making laugh?

30:27.910 --> 30:30.246
I also would've rejected
Madre Verde's offer.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.473
THE UNFINISHED WALTZ

30:49.515 --> 30:52.059
I can't believe Dad read
to me so much.

30:52.101 --> 30:56.021
He didn't like to read to you. I
made him. He grew into it with time.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.064
- Really?
- Mm.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.150
I took all the books and cleaned
the library with the move.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.444
Each one has a dedication.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.448
COLOMBIAN STORIES

31:14.123 --> 31:18.460
"To Ignacio. No dreamer is too small
and no dream too big."

31:18.502 --> 31:20.212
Dedications are like
the <i>I ching.</i>

31:21.422 --> 31:23.215
You have to listen
and follow what it says.

31:26.176 --> 31:26.885
This place has changed, right?

31:28.470 --> 31:31.015
I don't think so. It's just
like when you came last year.

31:31.056 --> 31:31.765
Is it?

31:32.933 --> 31:34.602
The person living here changed,
then.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.689
Yes, he probably changed.

31:38.731 --> 31:43.485
The old Ignacio would say the color
on that wall fades with time.

31:46.322 --> 31:49.867
Why are you so chill?
Is it the marijuana?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.494
I'm not judging.
I smoke sometimes too.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.083
What's the matter?
I'm getting worried.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.253
- Not enough sex?
- I'm not talking about that.

32:01.295 --> 32:02.796
You're talking
even if you don't want to.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.965
Okay, you wanna talk.
Yes, I'm seeing a girl

32:05.007 --> 32:07.051
who has probably lost interest in
me. That's it.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.928
Everyone loses interest in everyone.
It's natural.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.680
That's your way
of making me feel better?

32:11.722 --> 32:13.974
I didn't say it to make
you feel better.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.851
I just want you to wake up.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.729
I can say something
to make you feel better, sure...

32:18.771 --> 32:20.939
She'll be back.
I would if I were her.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.858
Don't bring up the
Oedipus complex.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.860
No, Electra.
Oedipus is the counterpart.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.237
- It would be her with the mother--
- Okay, enough!

32:28.781 --> 32:30.449
When did you become so weak?

32:30.491 --> 32:33.202
It has nothing to do
with weakness.

32:33.243 --> 32:34.244
Ignacio.

32:36.997 --> 32:37.998
What are you doing?

32:39.124 --> 32:40.668
Check out the photo I
just sent you.

32:46.256 --> 32:49.093
It'll remind you of a defeated man
when you look at it.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.889
I like you one moment, and I hate
you the next. Why is that?

32:53.931 --> 32:57.393
Because we love and hate
what reminds us of ourselves--

32:57.434 --> 32:59.645
Do you have a perfect answer
for everything?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.814
I wish I also had the
perfect questions.

33:05.234 --> 33:06.402
I'm leaving.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.241
Thank you.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.161
Take care.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.621
You too.

33:32.803 --> 33:33.846
Hey.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.600
If you also wanna see a successful
man, look at the photo.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.780
I told you!

33:57.077 --> 33:57.870
Hi.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.747
Am I interrupting?

33:59.788 --> 34:02.374
No. My mom was just stopping by.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.335
You don't look similar at all.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.297
So many people say we
look the same.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.553
Honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doing here.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.432
Maybe you wanna have me close,
like a reggaeton dance.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.477
I don't think so, I
hate reggaeton.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.145
So what could it be?

34:23.187 --> 34:24.605
If I knew, I wouldn't be here.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.901
Do you want some wine?
Let's find out what this means.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.820
Since when are you so personable
with me?

34:37.868 --> 34:39.620
I don't see any tequila.
Where is it?

35:11.693 --> 35:13.612
You're not answering
my messages anymore?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.325
Our deal is over.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.077
The money didn't convince you?

35:22.037 --> 35:23.413
Camila, that was a
one-time thing.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.542
Teo's not gonna keep
his arms crossed.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.877
I don't give a fuck
what he does with his arms.

35:28.919 --> 35:30.921
- You don't understand.
- What don't I understand?

35:30.963 --> 35:32.756
Teo won't take no for an answer.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.051
He knows where you
live and work.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.261
Are you threatening me now?

35:38.512 --> 35:40.430
I'm worried about you,
which is different.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.895
You can't say no to Teo.

35:57.948 --> 36:01.201
<i>Hi. How's everything?
How's the hotel?</i>

36:02.286 --> 36:05.372
Like every hotel.
Lifeless walls.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.125
<i>Did you go out yet?</i>

36:08.166 --> 36:10.752
No. I went straight
to the meeting.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.380
I'll try and go out
for a walk soon.

36:13.422 --> 36:16.508
Don't you want to go
to that restaurant I love?

36:16.550 --> 36:19.261
<i>Which?</i> <i>The</i> <i>one</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i> <i>outdoor</i> <i>seating
on</i> <i>the</i> <i>plaza?</i>

36:20.095 --> 36:21.346
It's nice, right?

36:21.388 --> 36:24.850
<i>Sure, but...
I don't feel like going alone.</i>

36:26.977 --> 36:29.062
You don't have to go alone.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.316
<i>No,</i> <i>these</i> <i>guys</i> <i>are</i> <i>gonna</i> <i>get</i> <i>drunk
somewhere.</i>

36:32.357 --> 36:33.901
<i>I don't think they wanna come.</i>

36:36.820 --> 36:38.697
Perhaps I can go.

36:40.407 --> 36:44.244
Mariana, stop joking. I'm on my sensitive
days of the month.

36:46.246 --> 36:49.750
I mean it. I just got a
ticket to Cartagena.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.126
I leave tonight.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.420
<i>You gotta be kidding.</i>

36:53.462 --> 36:58.508
I'm very serious. We can celebrate
my pre-birthday together.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.469
Are you serious?

37:00.510 --> 37:02.179
<i>I'm being serious.</i>

37:02.804 --> 37:03.805
<i>Very serious.</i>

37:04.723 --> 37:07.434
<i>I</i> <i>love</i> <i>you.</i> <i>You</i> <i>can't</i> <i>say</i> <i>I</i> <i>didn't
tell</i> <i>you</i> <i>today.</i>

37:07.476 --> 37:08.685
And I love you.

37:11.313 --> 37:14.483
I have to go now. I have to pack
and it's getting late.

37:14.524 --> 37:17.361
<i>Alright, then.
I'll pick you up at the airport.</i>

37:17.402 --> 37:20.530
Perfect. I'll see you
in a little bit.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.199
Okay.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.063
Cristina forgot to
give me the shot.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.032
Do you know how to do it?

38:04.074 --> 38:05.659
Do you wanna do it on your own?

38:14.418 --> 38:16.712
For your information,
I've never given a shot before.

38:28.932 --> 38:29.933
Alright.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.898
Get the air out.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.169
Felix, are you alright?

38:59.212 --> 39:00.338
Mm-hm.

39:15.687 --> 39:19.316
<i>Felix, wake up.
Motherfucker, wake up!</i>

39:19.357 --> 39:21.234
- Felix!
- <i>We have to get out of here!</i>

39:25.614 --> 39:27.115
I can't.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.825
Felix!

39:56.895 --> 39:59.773
<i>Do</i> <i>you</i> <i>think</i> <i>this</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>right</i> <i>way</i> <i>to
start</i> <i>a</i> <i>business?</i>

39:59.815 --> 40:01.942
I'm not the stupid
little girl anymore.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.152
I don't know what game
you're playing but, honestly,

40:04.194 --> 40:06.071
I don't wanna take part in it.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.585
I'm coming!

41:05.839 --> 41:07.048
What are you doing here?

41:13.722 --> 41:14.973
I need to talk to you.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.600
I can't. I'm late for
the airport.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.019
- Can you close the door?
- I'm leaving, Felix.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.898
Oh my God, what's going on?

41:25.901 --> 41:27.444
Felix, this isn't a game.

41:28.904 --> 41:30.280
Calm down.

41:31.198 --> 41:32.490
Everything will be okay.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.242
<i>What's going on?</i>

41:42.626 --> 41:43.835
<i>Felix, put that down.</i>

41:44.753 --> 41:46.254
Relax, breathe.

41:47.339 --> 41:48.423
Breathe.

41:49.758 --> 41:50.800
Relax.

41:53.094 --> 41:57.140
Felix, put that down. Put it
down, please! Felix, please!

41:58.767 --> 42:00.060
I killed Assaf.
