00:01.289 --> 00:04.247
Look at you, dressed like a girl.
Why the change?

00:04.305 --> 00:06.198
Did the roller-derby team
try to recruit you again?

00:06.255 --> 00:07.903
No.
I have a date with Ben.

00:07.973 --> 00:09.653
You don't seem
too excited about it.

00:09.755 --> 00:12.106
Well, I mean,
he's really nice, and...

00:12.169 --> 00:13.848
Got it.
You're bored, and so am I.

00:13.906 --> 00:15.000
Break up.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.075
I mean, I just want to see
what else is out there.

00:17.133 --> 00:19.032
- Does that make me a bad person?
- Oh, my God.

00:19.090 --> 00:20.201
Are we still
talking about this?

00:20.258 --> 00:21.797
I solved your problem. Today.

00:21.864 --> 00:23.699
Crowded restaurant
so he doesn't make a scene.

00:23.864 --> 00:25.520
Just deep breath
and say it.

00:25.629 --> 00:28.840
Fantastic news!
Someone TP'd our house!

00:28.919 --> 00:30.536
Halloween fun
is afoot.

00:30.637 --> 00:32.877
Dad, I really want
to be excited for you,

00:32.955 --> 00:34.369
but Halloween?

00:34.448 --> 00:35.919
We're almost
old enough to vote.

00:35.986 --> 00:37.733
- Aaaaaahhh!
- Whoa!

00:37.791 --> 00:39.355
Ha, ha, ha, ha hah!
Got me!

00:39.413 --> 00:40.503
Worth it?

00:40.561 --> 00:42.698
Oh, what, you're too old
for a little scare?

00:42.756 --> 00:44.605
The scariest thing is you could
be a cheap pick-up line,

00:44.662 --> 00:46.570
two beers, and nine months away
from being a grandparent,

00:46.627 --> 00:48.348
and you just risked
asphyxiation in the fridge.

00:48.405 --> 00:50.350
It's not like we're taking you
trick-or-treating.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.753
There are grown-up ways
to enjoy Halloween.

00:52.811 --> 00:54.440
How about
pumpkin-boat racing?

00:54.498 --> 00:56.131
Cam used to do it in Missouri.

00:56.233 --> 00:57.417
Take a giant pumpkin,

00:57.475 --> 00:58.557
cut the top off,

00:58.615 --> 01:00.581
gut it, hop in, sail away.

01:00.639 --> 01:01.667
Let's do it.

01:01.725 --> 01:03.237
I'm so married to this idea,

01:03.295 --> 01:05.787
it rolls its eyes
when I make jokes in public.

01:06.224 --> 01:08.514
Take notes... This might
help you out with Ben later.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.003
Mom, Dad?

01:10.061 --> 01:11.178
You and Halloween have had

01:11.236 --> 01:12.307
some great times together.

01:12.365 --> 01:13.974
- Mm.
- But it's over.

01:14.084 --> 01:16.147
You're way too old,
and it's hard to look at.

01:16.205 --> 01:17.522
Wow, it really lines up.

01:17.631 --> 01:19.706
- I see what's going on here.
- Thank God.

01:19.764 --> 01:20.972
I haven't communicated how big

01:21.030 --> 01:22.178
this pumpkin's gonna be.

01:22.311 --> 01:24.772
You guys know Clifford...
the Big Red Dog?

01:24.834 --> 01:26.834
- We're not doing this.
- Plus, we all have dates.

01:26.892 --> 01:28.642
- But...
- I think they're past it.

01:29.682 --> 01:31.178
That was
kinda harsh, huh?

01:31.236 --> 01:32.769
Oh, honey, don't take it too personally.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.979
Me? That was directed at you,
fridge monster.

01:35.037 --> 01:36.793
You're the one who's
obsessed with Halloween.

01:36.850 --> 01:38.522
Honey, you were the one who suggested

01:38.580 --> 01:39.733
getting a giant pumpkin

01:39.795 --> 01:41.003
and having us
sail away in it

01:41.061 --> 01:43.240
like a family of
cartoon mice.

01:43.445 --> 01:45.256
All pumpkins
are giant to mice.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.339
There is no use in us arguing
over who's more obsessed

01:48.397 --> 01:50.073
with a holiday that's behind us already.

01:50.131 --> 01:51.136
Way behind us.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.737
- All right. I got to get going, honey.
- Yeah, have a good one.

01:53.795 --> 01:54.854
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

01:54.912 --> 01:56.686
- Great. Buh-bye.
- Mm-hmm, bye.

02:00.638 --> 02:01.972
Change of plans, fellas.

02:02.030 --> 02:03.334
Hop in the car.

Well, well, well. You city
folk sure are late risers.

02:20.053 --> 02:22.100
I guess your rooster
has a snooze button.

02:22.709 --> 02:27.045
It's funny how you say the
exact, same thing every morning.

02:27.287 --> 02:28.674
Since our contractor took a break

02:28.740 --> 02:29.767
from rehabbing kitchens

02:29.825 --> 02:32.221
- to rehab a gambling problem...
- Yeah.

02:32.279 --> 02:33.971
Jay took over, and
we've been staying here.

02:34.038 --> 02:35.288
It's been a lot of Dad,

02:35.346 --> 02:37.123
but it...
it just became too impractical

02:37.190 --> 02:38.604
to continue living at home.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.718
We're gonna use another
coat of varnish.

02:40.776 --> 02:43.175
The fumes shouldn't be
too noticeable.

02:43.362 --> 02:45.182
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, boy. Lily.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.167
Oh, gosh! Okay, she's down!

02:47.229 --> 02:49.499
It's been hard on us,
living without a kitchen.

02:49.557 --> 02:51.885
It's been, uh, six weeks
now since it burned down.

02:51.956 --> 02:53.031
Since you burned it down.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.390
Since I burned it down.

02:54.448 --> 02:56.284
And then maliciously
made me think I did it

02:56.354 --> 02:58.382
and leveraged my guilt
for your own selfish gain.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.773
Then maliciously made you think

02:59.831 --> 03:01.273
that you did it, and leveraged...

03:01.331 --> 03:03.492
Honey, you got to stop
beating yourself up.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.593
Okay.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.486
I was going to make Joe's oatmeal.

03:06.544 --> 03:08.997
Do you really have to
use all five burners?

03:09.073 --> 03:11.499
Well, it is called Five Burner Meat Pie,

03:11.557 --> 03:12.804
and it's the traditional dish

03:12.862 --> 03:14.335
back at the Halloween festival,

03:14.393 --> 03:16.367
so it kinda makes me
feel like I'm there.

03:16.425 --> 03:17.515
Mm.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.992
No oatmeal?

03:19.050 --> 03:21.440
Guess I could put my beard on now.

03:21.526 --> 03:23.182
Come over here!

03:23.323 --> 03:24.487
Ow!

03:24.557 --> 03:27.198
Look, I'm sorry,
but the God I worship

03:27.370 --> 03:29.901
does not let his roots show, so...

03:29.964 --> 03:31.085
Two weeks ago,

03:31.143 --> 03:33.237
we invited Mitch and Cam to stay here.

03:33.321 --> 03:34.773
You invited them.

03:35.030 --> 03:36.359
It's been hard on us,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.393
but it's part of our
Colombian heritage...

03:38.460 --> 03:39.737
Your heritage.

03:39.878 --> 03:41.242
To welcome family

03:41.300 --> 03:43.117
and to never kick them out,

03:43.175 --> 03:46.323
even when they might
have some boundary issues.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.503
I'm heading back to the job site.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.992
Gonna let the guys knock off

03:50.050 --> 03:52.557
for a little liqu-or-treating.

03:52.635 --> 03:54.925
Well, that is how you manage...

03:55.010 --> 03:56.546
to stretch a job until Christmas.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.101
Okay, you need to go over there,

03:58.159 --> 03:59.402
find out how long this is gonna take.

03:59.459 --> 04:00.796
I want my kitchen back.

04:00.857 --> 04:02.464
Okay, uh, Dad?

04:02.557 --> 04:04.440
W... we appreciate
all your hard work,

04:04.518 --> 04:06.648
but we're running a
little past schedule.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.218
The job is done when the job is done.

04:08.283 --> 04:10.800
You want it faster, next time,
burn down a bookshelf.

04:10.858 --> 04:12.851
Well, clearly, he doesn't
know what he's doing

04:12.909 --> 04:14.891
- and he's too proud to admit it.
- I know. I know.

04:14.948 --> 04:18.327
My breakfast is
a LUNA Bar for women.

04:18.385 --> 04:19.697
Do something.

04:19.755 --> 04:22.119
They're family.
What do you want me to do?

04:22.177 --> 04:23.374
You need to fire your father.

04:23.432 --> 04:24.908
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

04:25.033 --> 04:26.566
- Mitchell.
- I swear to God.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.860
Promise me you'll get rid of them.

04:28.927 --> 04:30.006
Okay.

04:30.064 --> 04:31.694
Make me believe it.

04:31.752 --> 04:33.408
I swear to you.

04:33.602 --> 04:35.061
I didn't have a date with a guy,

04:35.119 --> 04:37.014
but rather a date with Destiny.

04:37.072 --> 04:38.835
Destiny was the name
of the casting director

04:38.893 --> 04:40.422
I was auditioning for.
I saw an ad,

04:40.480 --> 04:42.090
for backup
singers on a cruise ship,

04:42.148 --> 04:43.458
and I knew it was fate.

04:43.525 --> 04:45.812
I have a killer voice,
I love karaoke,

04:45.883 --> 04:47.945
and I'm great
at partying on boats.

04:48.148 --> 04:49.297
Haley Dunphy?

04:49.367 --> 04:50.640
Ahoy!

04:50.742 --> 04:52.156
I speak "ship."

04:52.344 --> 04:54.845
Bon voyage, mateys.
I crushed it.

04:55.054 --> 04:56.922
I even crushed the modesty after.

04:57.038 --> 05:00.570
"No,
thank you for the chance to sing."

05:02.478 --> 05:03.804
Beth and Jessica...

05:03.862 --> 05:05.195
- Bye.
- You guys stay.

05:05.293 --> 05:06.852
Haley, we'll be in touch.

05:07.679 --> 05:09.316
I had a good feeling about you two

05:09.383 --> 05:11.468
when I found out you
were fellow Kappa sisters.

05:11.526 --> 05:12.723
Wait.

05:12.781 --> 05:14.426
You're all in the same sorority?

05:14.484 --> 05:16.341
Only the best sorority.

05:16.408 --> 05:18.036
Kappa Kappa Theta!

05:18.094 --> 05:19.864
- Ooh, I wanna take ya...
- Okay, okay.

05:19.922 --> 05:22.101
This is why everyone
hates college graduates.

05:22.179 --> 05:23.578
I will walk out that door,

05:23.640 --> 05:25.684
but at least show me
enough respect to admit

05:25.751 --> 05:27.950
that this decision had
nothing to do with talent.

05:28.008 --> 05:30.234
Because everyone knows
that I was the best.

05:30.312 --> 05:31.953
Well, that took a lot of guts.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.153
Come with me.

05:33.211 --> 05:35.093
Let's take a second
look at your audition.

- Okay. I've seen enough.
- Oh, no, no, no.

05:53.127 --> 05:54.792
I had to sit through this whole thing.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.368
You will, too.

05:57.449 --> 05:59.547
You got to remember,
this was the '60s.

05:59.695 --> 06:02.031
Competition in the
closet game was fierce,

06:02.101 --> 06:04.375
everybody chasing after
the next big storage idea.

06:04.433 --> 06:07.242
Historians remember this
period as the "space race."

06:07.300 --> 06:08.937
- Oh, Mitchell.
- Uh, Dad?

06:08.995 --> 06:10.508
Uh, I would like to see the kitchen.

06:10.566 --> 06:12.712
I'd like to think that drinking
beer makes my hair grow back,

06:12.769 --> 06:13.809
but life ain't fair.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.317
Okay, uh, then w... we need to talk.

06:15.384 --> 06:16.561
You guys want to take it outside?

06:16.618 --> 06:18.469
I need a couple minutes with El Rojo.

06:18.836 --> 06:19.887
Mm-hmm.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.330
- Rojo means "red."
- Yeah.

06:22.388 --> 06:24.530
I put things together
quickly, unlike your workers,

06:24.588 --> 06:25.748
which is, uh, why I'm here.

06:25.806 --> 06:27.378
Um, Dad, if this is too much for you...

06:27.440 --> 06:28.452
Now, wait a second.

06:28.510 --> 06:30.591
- You're not here to fire me, are you?
- What? No.

06:30.649 --> 06:31.807
Pfft! That's a strong word.

06:31.865 --> 06:33.541
I've done enough
axing in my time

06:33.599 --> 06:34.674
to recognize the look.

06:34.732 --> 06:35.757
Just do it.

06:35.815 --> 06:38.581
See, now, I was... I was hoping
this would be more of a conversation.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.143
Never been much for
confrontation.

06:40.323 --> 06:42.968
You weren't engaged to a
woman six months in law school

06:43.026 --> 06:44.827
because you were good
at dropping the hammer.

06:44.885 --> 06:46.327
Didn't you guys get a cat together?

06:46.385 --> 06:47.593
Okay, you know?
Y... y... yes!

06:47.651 --> 06:49.023
You're fired! Okay?

06:49.081 --> 06:50.534
You're an incompetent man-diva.

06:50.592 --> 06:52.554
The only thing
you've ever built is a closet...

06:52.612 --> 06:53.929
i.e. a box of air.

06:53.987 --> 06:55.041
So get out,

06:55.107 --> 06:56.307
and don't let the door hit you

06:56.365 --> 06:58.059
on your ample behind.

07:00.969 --> 07:02.195
Nicely done.

07:02.254 --> 07:04.074
Maybe an unnecessary shot
at closets,

07:04.141 --> 07:06.532
particularly from someone
who was in one for 22 years,

07:06.590 --> 07:07.762
- but...
- Mm.

07:07.832 --> 07:09.371
Yeah, I get it.

07:09.688 --> 07:11.833
I'll just grab my stuff.

07:13.887 --> 07:16.208
Oh, my God. Dad, it's... it's done!

07:16.356 --> 07:18.279
- Yep.
- Well, why didn't you say something?

07:18.346 --> 07:20.632
Well, I saw you marching
in here, loaded for bear.

07:20.699 --> 07:22.111
You don't usually go off on people,

07:22.169 --> 07:23.158
so I thought it'd be good for you.

07:23.216 --> 07:24.626
- How'd it feel?
- I didn't love it.

07:24.684 --> 07:25.900
But this kitchen is amazing.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.306
I only got one more thing to do.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.325
I've got to seal glass
in the door and hang it.

07:29.387 --> 07:30.750
Now, you want to go with the stain

07:30.817 --> 07:32.306
or the clear pane Cam picked?

07:32.364 --> 07:33.598
Hmm. You know what?

07:33.669 --> 07:35.290
I... I bought this
at a flea market.

07:35.356 --> 07:36.580
They're not sure of the origin.

07:36.637 --> 07:39.095
It either came from a
17th-century Flemish cathedral

07:39.153 --> 07:40.485
that collapsed in an earthquake

07:40.552 --> 07:42.380
or a high-school
production of "Nunsense."

07:42.885 --> 07:43.923
Oh, I do love this.

07:43.981 --> 07:45.665
Should...
should I ask Cam if it's okay?

07:45.723 --> 07:47.095
You almost just fired your dad.

07:47.153 --> 07:49.407
- You're not gonna go shy on me on this...
- You know what?

07:49.464 --> 07:50.579
You're right.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.763
It's this glass.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.298
That's it. Hey?

07:53.356 --> 07:55.133
You want to help me finish this off,

07:55.191 --> 07:57.084
- just the two of us?
- You know what?

07:57.151 --> 07:58.753
Yes. Yeah, I... I would.

07:59.058 --> 08:01.691
Let me just strap on this bad boy.

08:04.543 --> 08:06.683
So, all the tools have been laid out.

08:06.748 --> 08:07.840
What next?

08:10.728 --> 08:12.937
- Phil.
- Hey, Carol.

08:12.995 --> 08:14.875
I just found out my kids
did this to your yard,

08:14.933 --> 08:16.645
and we are so sorry.

08:16.703 --> 08:18.388
Don't be. It's Halloween.

08:18.470 --> 08:21.125
It's one of the four biggest
prank days of the year.

08:21.165 --> 08:22.669
It's this, April Fools' Day,

08:22.727 --> 08:24.340
and the day before April Fools' Day,

08:24.398 --> 08:25.540
'cause no one sees it coming.

08:25.597 --> 08:26.629
What's the fourth?

08:26.687 --> 08:27.852
Nice try, Carol.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.141
The point is,

08:29.199 --> 08:30.512
you're gonna wake up
one morning

08:30.570 --> 08:32.549
and find out that your
kids don't TP anymore.

08:32.616 --> 08:35.289
Cherish these days with
your adorable little vandals.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.022
Well, I appreciate the
understanding,

08:37.080 --> 08:38.736
but I'm trying
to teach them a lesson.

08:38.794 --> 08:39.948
Oh, I'm gonna teach them
a lesson,

08:40.005 --> 08:41.371
'cause it's payback time.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.832
Pranks wars have begun.

08:44.364 --> 08:45.470
Yes!

08:45.528 --> 08:46.939
Okay, kids. I think Mr. Dunphy

08:46.997 --> 08:49.783
has better things to do than spend
his day in a prank war with you.

08:49.841 --> 08:52.130
Good news, boys. I don't.

08:52.609 --> 08:53.728
Okay.

08:53.786 --> 08:55.549
We cannot take you
trick-or-treating

08:55.607 --> 08:57.937
if you don't finish
your homework.

08:58.185 --> 09:01.872
Didn't you two have something
you wanted to talk about?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.806
Um, so, Cam...

09:03.864 --> 09:05.213
I'm trying to get Wi-Fi

09:05.271 --> 09:07.455
so I can watch the pumpkin weigh-in

09:07.513 --> 09:10.017
at the Halloween festival back home.
You know, 25 years ago,

09:10.075 --> 09:11.752
I raised
the largest Wichita Thumper,

09:11.810 --> 09:13.622
and the record still stands.
I am so sorry.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.229
There's no way to say that
that doesn't sound braggy.

09:16.296 --> 09:18.224
No, no, you just did fine.

09:18.372 --> 09:20.376
Um, but I just wanted
to say to you...

09:20.466 --> 09:22.944
You know, as with every
pumpkin, there's a story.

09:23.011 --> 09:25.424
It was a cold, bitter night,

09:25.482 --> 09:27.783
when tap-tap-tap on the window.

09:27.841 --> 09:30.450
Darn if it wasn't the
vine of my pumpkin,

09:30.552 --> 09:32.146
just out there trembling away.

09:32.247 --> 09:33.713
That is a great story.

09:33.771 --> 09:35.526
Next thing I know,
Daddy's pulling the pumpkin

09:35.583 --> 09:38.052
through the window, careful, of
course, not to break the vine.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.377
And for months, it just became
a part of our household...

09:40.435 --> 09:42.642
people stepping over it
to get into the kitchen,

09:42.700 --> 09:43.924
blocked half the TV.

09:43.982 --> 09:45.185
We thought "The Brady Bunch"

09:45.243 --> 09:47.099
was just about three lovely girls.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.572
Oh, but nobody complained.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.323
Sure, I won Grand Champion,

09:51.513 --> 09:53.646
you know, and the right
to name the next tornado.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.775
But the thing I remember most

09:55.833 --> 09:57.154
are the sacrifices

09:57.255 --> 09:59.665
my family made for just me.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.979
That's how we do family
where I'm from.

10:03.224 --> 10:05.337
That's how we do family
where I am from!

10:05.404 --> 10:06.709
- Oh, Gloria!
- Mmm!

10:06.767 --> 10:09.083
I got to get this Wi-Fi.

10:11.341 --> 10:13.078
You saw that, didn't you?

10:13.481 --> 10:15.193
I see everything.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.908
In 10 minutes,

10:16.966 --> 10:18.267
you're gonna storm the office,

10:18.325 --> 10:19.525
everybody freaks out,

10:19.583 --> 10:21.763
I go Wonder Woman,
fight off the zombies.

10:21.857 --> 10:22.931
- Got it.
- Okay.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.376
My kids may be over it,

10:24.443 --> 10:27.438
but at the office, they
love Halloween Claire.

10:27.505 --> 10:30.007
It's one of the perks of
working at Pritchett's Closets.

10:30.074 --> 10:33.135
Sure, you got to pitch in for
coffee the rest of the year,

10:33.202 --> 10:36.638
but on October 31st,
the show is free.

10:36.705 --> 10:38.237
- Hey.
- Ah.

10:38.315 --> 10:40.031
Everyone's on their
way here to a meeting.

10:40.089 --> 10:43.362
- Great.
- Oh, so, no costume this year?

10:43.472 --> 10:45.164
Apparently not.

10:45.231 --> 10:46.417
Oh, good call.

10:46.503 --> 10:48.448
Everyone was so sick of it.

10:48.519 --> 10:49.875
The pressure to dress up!

10:49.933 --> 10:51.332
You know, they begged me to talk to you,

10:51.389 --> 10:53.097
but I said, "No, Claire will realize

10:53.155 --> 10:54.628
how miserable everybody is."

10:54.765 --> 10:57.176
- So no... nobody...
- I vant to drink your...

10:57.243 --> 10:58.494
We don't have to do it anymore.

10:58.561 --> 11:00.138
Oh, thank God!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.386
You know, I cried in
the mirror this morning?

11:02.584 --> 11:04.339
Guys, everybody. It's over.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.776
The whole thing's
finally over. No worries.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.729
Oh. Yeah.

11:08.796 --> 11:10.211
I'm just gonna
need a quick second.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.726
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

11:11.784 --> 11:13.109
- Sorry.
- Go.

11:13.362 --> 11:15.069
So, if you could just,

11:15.136 --> 11:17.683
uh, take your attention
to the screen, please.

11:17.769 --> 11:20.940
And... for the market research...

11:20.998 --> 11:22.144
Please. Nobody wants this.

11:22.334 --> 11:24.787
Oh, she's surprising us.

11:24.846 --> 11:26.469
It's a zombie attack.

11:26.664 --> 11:27.922
Yay.

11:28.078 --> 11:32.712
Oh, but it's Wonder
Woman to the rescue, yeah.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.363
Wonder Woman, help me.

11:34.430 --> 11:36.493
Okay, fun's over.

11:36.578 --> 11:38.336
Come on. Everybody...

11:38.477 --> 11:39.594
Oh!

11:39.661 --> 11:40.817
Okay! All right!

11:40.875 --> 11:41.927
Here! Take it! Take it!

11:41.985 --> 11:44.414
Ow, God! I am so sorry!

11:44.492 --> 11:45.771
You're home early.

11:45.868 --> 11:48.132
I was into this awesome
girl, Abby, from the club.

11:48.282 --> 11:50.521
And tonight, we were gonna
take things to the next level,

11:50.578 --> 11:52.274
which is, you know, sex.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.691
Always classy to name it.

11:53.758 --> 11:55.700
But the one problem
is she's super jealous

11:55.758 --> 11:57.419
and got this idea
I was messing around

11:57.477 --> 11:59.137
with Carla from the snack bar.

11:59.266 --> 12:00.573
Which I was.

12:00.758 --> 12:02.708
So I had to break it off with Carla

12:02.766 --> 12:03.856
before seeing Abby.

12:03.914 --> 12:07.020
- How'd it go?
- I got a major tong lashing.

12:07.087 --> 12:08.039
Ow!

12:08.106 --> 12:10.082
Ow! What the heck? Whoa! Hey!

12:10.149 --> 12:11.483
Carla, calm down! Wait... Oh!

12:11.550 --> 12:14.444
Wait, wait, I can explain!
I can explain! Somebody help!

12:14.511 --> 12:16.047
So I covered up my bruises

12:16.114 --> 12:19.242
and checked for any snack-bar-related
evidence before seeing Abby.

12:19.309 --> 12:20.671
Sorry I'm late.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.163
I got whiplash passing
a picture of you.

12:23.270 --> 12:25.788
Things couldn't have
been going any better...

12:26.082 --> 12:28.296
My dad is going to hate you.

12:28.525 --> 12:31.101
And then they got better.

12:31.202 --> 12:32.379
Until...

12:32.446 --> 12:33.481
Mustard?

12:33.569 --> 12:34.732
You hate mustard.

12:34.905 --> 12:37.046
You son of a bitch!
You were with Carla!

12:37.132 --> 12:38.841
I knew there was
one perfect thing

12:38.907 --> 12:40.008
I could say to save it.

12:40.076 --> 12:42.112
Baby, I just snack with her.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.108
You're the main course.

12:44.895 --> 12:47.063
I did not come up with that thing.

12:48.138 --> 12:49.656
All right.

12:49.866 --> 12:51.457
- Ahh!
- Looks good.

12:51.524 --> 12:52.750
You know, I helped build that.

12:52.817 --> 12:54.484
I... I feel like a
real construction guy.

12:54.551 --> 12:56.254
I kinda wish a woman
would walk by

12:56.321 --> 12:57.321
so I could objectify her.

12:57.388 --> 12:58.554
It's the best.

12:58.624 --> 13:00.199
Listen,
we just finished the project.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.324
Now, come on. Take a victory
lap with your old man.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.944
Oh. I'd love to.

13:04.043 --> 13:05.269
Hey, and I defy Cam

13:05.327 --> 13:06.919
to find anything wrong
with that window.

13:06.976 --> 13:08.796
It really gives your kitchen some flair.

13:11.252 --> 13:12.687
Oh, hey, Gloria.

13:12.843 --> 13:14.605
I finally found a
great spot for the Wi-Fi

13:14.663 --> 13:16.374
just in time for the
pumpkin weigh-in.

13:16.432 --> 13:19.421
You sit here
while I take a bath?!

13:19.538 --> 13:21.153
I'm gay? Hello?

13:21.220 --> 13:23.197
I'm more fixated
on that fabulous robe.

13:23.264 --> 13:25.241
I am so borrowing
that for my next bath.

13:25.299 --> 13:26.924
You didn't drain the water yet,
did you?

13:27.042 --> 13:28.060
Okay, that's it!

13:28.127 --> 13:29.787
I can't handle you anymore!

13:29.854 --> 13:31.104
You take over my kitchen!

13:31.171 --> 13:33.288
I turn around,
and you're in my face!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.674
Siamese twins have more
privacy than me!

13:35.860 --> 13:38.343
Get out of my house,
and never come back!

13:40.009 --> 13:41.295
Hm.

13:41.648 --> 13:43.301
Well, the kitchen's done.

13:43.368 --> 13:45.411
So I guess I can move back home.

13:47.121 --> 13:48.644
He couldn't have sent you that message

13:48.702 --> 13:50.011
one minute ago?

13:50.069 --> 13:51.267
It's okay, Gloria.

13:51.334 --> 13:53.304
It's better that I know
how you actually feel.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.416
Oh.

13:55.546 --> 13:57.405
Well, there seems to be a lot of
hubbub on the

13:57.515 --> 13:59.038
dais at pump' fest.

13:59.187 --> 14:01.155
Why are they gathering
all the living mayors?

14:01.312 --> 14:02.525
It's official.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.874
Ms. Darla Bowater has shattered
the old pumpkin record.

14:06.696 --> 14:07.696
Okay.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.894
I'm sure you'll understand,

14:08.952 --> 14:09.929
under these circumstances,

14:09.987 --> 14:12.131
I'll just quickly gather
my things, take that bath,

14:12.189 --> 14:15.296
and... be on my way.

14:16.946 --> 14:18.004
Who is it?

14:18.062 --> 14:20.483
Special delivery from UPS.

14:20.605 --> 14:22.780
United Prank Service.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.749
I went to the history
books for this one,

14:24.812 --> 14:26.702
all the way back to the
first practical joke...

14:26.760 --> 14:27.773
the Trojan Horse.

14:27.831 --> 14:30.082
Only I swapped out silly
string for broad swords

14:30.230 --> 14:31.832
and laughter for murder.

14:32.046 --> 14:33.382
Okay.

14:34.429 --> 14:35.895
You guys want to prank?

14:36.032 --> 14:37.187
Let's prank.

14:39.048 --> 14:40.841
Oh, no.

14:41.806 --> 14:43.507
Oh, no!

14:44.898 --> 14:46.822
No!

14:46.889 --> 14:49.575
Nooooo!

14:49.642 --> 14:51.643
No! Oh!

14:56.691 --> 15:00.331
They just put some
toilet paper in your yard.

15:00.491 --> 15:02.672
Why would he do this to us, Mother?

15:02.730 --> 15:03.923
It was an accident!

15:03.982 --> 15:06.626
Where's Fluffy?!
I can't find Fluffy!

15:06.692 --> 15:08.654
Don't worry! I'll help you find her!

15:08.933 --> 15:10.237
My eye!

15:10.295 --> 15:12.259
Go in the house! Go in the house!

15:14.837 --> 15:16.931
Oh, why do I feel so energized?

15:17.086 --> 15:19.783
Because you honored your
primal male instinct to build.

15:19.884 --> 15:21.939
Yeah.
Where once lay barren fields,

15:21.997 --> 15:24.962
because of men like us,
now gleaming cities stand.

15:25.088 --> 15:26.740
And what is a city, but...

15:26.798 --> 15:28.775
A closet for civilization.

15:29.666 --> 15:31.087
This is the proudest

15:31.145 --> 15:33.189
- damn moment of my life.
- Ah.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.024
Oof.

15:35.161 --> 15:37.283
That brings back painful memories.

15:38.701 --> 15:41.828
Huh, seems to be
turning down our street.

15:42.369 --> 15:43.955
Well, what do you know?

15:44.110 --> 15:47.213
This crystal in the middle
acted like a magnifying glass.

15:47.289 --> 15:48.400
- Mr. Pritchett...
- Yeah.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.095
This is the second
time in two months.

15:50.153 --> 15:51.504
We love that you're a fan,

15:51.609 --> 15:53.517
but maybe you should
just buy a calendar.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.970
I'm sorry, Mitch.
I feel really bad.

15:56.068 --> 15:57.736
Do you think maybe
you could tell Cam?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.560
Oh, I don't work here anymore.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.947
Phil? Honey?

16:07.188 --> 16:08.301
Claire.

16:08.572 --> 16:10.322
There's no sense in hiding it.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.327
I did buy a giant pumpkin.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.118
I puzzled that one out.

16:14.186 --> 16:15.540
You're right.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.391
I'm a Halloween-obsessed
child-man.

16:17.449 --> 16:18.657
Do you want to feel better?

16:18.715 --> 16:20.314
I took zombies to work,
okay?

16:20.372 --> 16:22.392
And it died so hard.

16:22.493 --> 16:24.736
Oh, my God, to be pitied
by Margaret...

16:24.794 --> 16:26.103
I guess the kids are right.

16:26.492 --> 16:28.284
It's time for us to
start acting like adults.

16:28.342 --> 16:31.220
We can have dinner parties,
see plays, open IRAs.

16:31.278 --> 16:32.493
We have IRAs, right?

16:32.551 --> 16:34.086
Rude awakening, Claire.

16:34.407 --> 16:36.220
You think
you're the fun-loving dad,

16:36.313 --> 16:39.462
putting smiles on faces,
keeping childhood alive.

16:39.779 --> 16:41.431
Turns out you're just the weird guy

16:41.489 --> 16:43.572
barreling down a driveway
in a pumpkin-tank.

16:43.630 --> 16:47.501
Phil, I command you to
stop speaking like that.

16:47.581 --> 16:49.540
Please let me have my
feelings for one second.

16:49.669 --> 16:51.729
No, come on, turn around.
Seriously. It's good.

16:51.898 --> 16:53.633
Wonder Woman?

16:53.691 --> 16:56.318
Yes! And I have plans for you!

16:56.688 --> 16:58.899
Who cares what anybody thinks?

16:58.972 --> 17:00.875
Screw the kids.
Screw everybody at work.

17:00.933 --> 17:03.577
We'll give up Halloween
when we are good and ready.

17:03.795 --> 17:05.454
Who are you guys supposed to be?

17:05.647 --> 17:07.570
Who your parents wish they were.

17:09.227 --> 17:10.935
Ending things with Ben did not go well.

17:10.993 --> 17:12.154
He kept giving me openings,

17:12.212 --> 17:13.712
and I just couldn't pull the trigger.

17:13.844 --> 17:15.737
Why do I keep eating this stale bread?

17:15.867 --> 17:16.944
Do you ever do that?

17:17.011 --> 17:18.180
Like, you know something's bad,

17:18.237 --> 17:19.415
but you just keep going in for more

17:19.472 --> 17:20.873
'cause it's the only
thing in front of you?

17:20.930 --> 17:22.031
Mm-hmm.

17:22.098 --> 17:23.934
Uh, hey, this is gonna
sound really gross,

17:24.001 --> 17:25.321
but I have a Band-Aid
on my hand,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.814
it's on a super-hairy spot,
and I know it's gonna sting.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.474
Would you take it off
for me, please?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.235
And do it fast. If I'm gonna be hurt,

17:31.318 --> 17:32.977
I just want to get it over with.

17:34.278 --> 17:35.487
- I want to break up.
- Ow!

17:35.554 --> 17:36.672
Whew!

17:36.739 --> 17:37.923
Ready to order?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.071
Uh, did you not just hear what I said?

17:40.196 --> 17:41.635
No. What?

17:41.702 --> 17:43.078
- I want to break up.
- Ah-choo!

17:43.145 --> 17:44.263
Whew!

17:44.330 --> 17:46.091
So, I'm thinking nachos.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.930
- What about you?
- Oh, my God!

17:48.063 --> 17:49.397
I'm breaking up with you!

17:49.502 --> 17:50.662
What?

17:50.720 --> 17:51.937
I'm so sorry.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.297
It's been really great,
but now it's over.

17:54.446 --> 17:56.055
Please don't make a scene.

17:56.314 --> 17:57.772
I mean, I'm sad, but I get it.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.961
We're in different phases of our lives,

18:00.034 --> 18:02.737
and you live an hour
away from me now,

18:02.859 --> 18:04.169
and I made out with my ex

18:04.227 --> 18:05.852
last weekend at the closet convention,

18:05.911 --> 18:07.219
so how committed am I?

18:07.298 --> 18:09.424
Plus that tension between
you and Muh-ma... Oy.

18:09.649 --> 18:11.040
You cheated on me?!

18:11.098 --> 18:12.188
We were drunk, okay?

18:12.246 --> 18:13.860
And she was really upset

18:13.995 --> 18:16.038
'cause she had to drop her
daughter off at college.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.047
You suck!

18:18.399 --> 18:20.257
To think I wasted so much time

18:20.324 --> 18:22.742
on such a weepy,
clingy, Pez-eating snore!

18:22.917 --> 18:25.876
I can't believe I sat there
and pretended to be a doll

18:25.934 --> 18:27.790
as you brushed my hair!

18:28.517 --> 18:31.602
You are almost the worst
boyfriend I have ever had!

18:31.731 --> 18:34.790
Okay, Alex wins most embarrassing day.

18:36.626 --> 18:37.985
Not so fast.

18:38.043 --> 18:39.767
Look at these two ding dongs.

18:40.355 --> 18:43.476
Is that Mom and Dad in a giant "punkin"?

18:43.723 --> 18:46.224
Well, at least we didn't get
dragged into it this time.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.462
Thank God.

18:47.587 --> 18:50.150
Yep. Because we got
stuff goin' on.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.415
Cam...

18:56.949 --> 18:58.399
I'm sure that
there were better ways

18:58.530 --> 19:01.298
for me to say what I said.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.425
You're packing my face creams.

19:03.492 --> 19:05.076
No need to apologize.

19:05.134 --> 19:06.661
I know I crossed boundaries.

19:06.728 --> 19:07.860
It's how I grew up.

19:07.962 --> 19:09.390
Nobody had secrets from anybody.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.251
At high-school parties,
we just played Dare.

19:11.407 --> 19:12.525
I know the feeling.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.048
I grew up in a small town myself.

19:14.106 --> 19:15.892
We had to bring in a stranger

19:15.976 --> 19:19.274
so that the children could
learn who not to talk to.

19:19.347 --> 19:21.032
You know, I have to say,
sometimes your

19:21.095 --> 19:22.716
hometown stories
sound a little made-up.

19:22.774 --> 19:23.978
I am sorry that I was mean,

19:24.036 --> 19:25.329
and I am sorry that

19:25.579 --> 19:27.907
you don't have the
biggest pumpkin anymore.

19:28.012 --> 19:30.924
It's not even about
having the record anymore.

19:31.085 --> 19:33.836
It... it's just how I kept
the small town alive in me.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.563
- Probably dumb.
- No.

19:35.665 --> 19:38.478
It's hard when you have
to leave a place you love.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.738
Every year, it feels like
more of it fades away.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.948
I get very sad because I know

19:44.063 --> 19:47.852
that my accent is
almost completely gone.

19:48.016 --> 19:49.555
Anyway, I... I should go.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.571
Wait. I have something for you.

19:54.032 --> 19:55.844
A pumpkin seed?

19:56.813 --> 20:00.090
I think it can be next
year's record-breaker.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.204
Oh, my... Gloria...

20:03.052 --> 20:04.320
Okay!

20:04.387 --> 20:06.325
- All right, all right!
- Oh, my gosh!

20:06.387 --> 20:07.548
Oh, my God!

20:07.615 --> 20:09.239
We're floating in a vegetable!

20:09.309 --> 20:11.653
In a giant vegetable!

20:11.852 --> 20:13.848
<i>As families get older,
you have two options...</i>

20:13.910 --> 20:15.720
<i>you can force everyone together,</i>

20:15.778 --> 20:17.880
<i>or you can accept that traditions die</i>

20:18.096 --> 20:19.965
<i>and people move on.</i>

20:20.120 --> 20:22.981
<i>Unless you happen to
have a giant pumpkin.</i>

20:23.129 --> 20:25.338
Hey! What are you guys
doing here?

20:25.481 --> 20:26.675
We got the hint.

20:26.742 --> 20:28.541
It wasn't gonna be fun
unless we were here, too,

20:28.598 --> 20:29.785
so we tracked your phones.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.096
Cam says the record

20:31.163 --> 20:34.087
for the North American 50-yard
pumpkin dash is 18 seconds.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.231
- I think we can do it!
- Oh, I know we can do it!

20:36.289 --> 20:37.116
- Time us!
- Let's do it!

20:37.174 --> 20:38.352
- Okay!
- Okay!

20:38.410 --> 20:40.949
You can do it!
Beat that 18 seconds!

20:41.027 --> 20:42.785
You're so close!

20:43.551 --> 20:45.527
Whoo!

20:45.594 --> 20:46.688
Wait! There... row it there!

20:46.745 --> 20:48.430
Okay. Did we do it?
Was that 18 seconds?

20:48.497 --> 20:49.766
5 minutes.

20:49.824 --> 20:51.205
Still close!

20:55.416 --> 20:56.990
All right, here's what happened...

20:57.236 --> 20:59.553
right after you sent the text
saying the kitchen was done,

20:59.611 --> 21:02.150
the inspector popped in
for a little surprise visit,

21:02.220 --> 21:03.697
nails us with four violations,

21:03.764 --> 21:05.846
which pushes us back for
a couple of weeks now.

21:05.904 --> 21:06.920
Blame me.

21:06.978 --> 21:08.410
I can take the hit from
Cam.

21:08.477 --> 21:09.741
You stay with Claire

21:09.799 --> 21:11.646
'cause I can't take the hit
from Gloria.

21:11.713 --> 21:13.346
- Right.
- Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

21:13.404 --> 21:15.703
Not a word. I do all the talking.

21:15.761 --> 21:17.385
Because you're a terrible liar.

21:17.692 --> 21:19.022
Hey. There you are.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.003
- Good day?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm?

21:21.061 --> 21:22.666
What... what's
that supposed to mean?

21:22.724 --> 21:24.838
You only say that when you're guilty.
You smell like smoke.

21:24.895 --> 21:26.221
Oh, my God, did you burn
the kitchen down again?

21:26.278 --> 21:27.921
It's like you don't want me
to help you!

21:27.979 --> 21:30.546
