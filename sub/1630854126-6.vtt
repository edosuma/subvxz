WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:06.832
Mm. Vision.
I love it.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.530
Lil Uzi Vert.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.012
I'd be sure to throw away
all my trash today.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.883
Oh, right. Of course.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.145
Ant season?

00:15.189 --> 00:16.929
Ghost season.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
That's funny.

00:19.367 --> 00:22.022
Nothing funny about it, playboy.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.676
The janitor used to work
right here...

00:24.720 --> 00:29.116
spent his days
picking up trash.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.118
Was good at it, too.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.336
But he couldn't
stop people

00:32.380 --> 00:34.034
from leaving
their trash everywhere.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.384
And it haunted him
till the day he died

00:36.427 --> 00:40.257
mysteriously on Halloween,
right here,

00:40.301 --> 00:42.999
in the very basement
of this school.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.653
What?

00:44.696 --> 00:47.438
Every Halloween,
if you listen closely,

00:47.482 --> 00:50.180
you can hear the wheels
of his mop bucket

00:50.224 --> 00:52.008
rolling down there.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.228
Ohh!

00:56.099 --> 00:57.274
Happy Halloween, Gregory.

00:57.318 --> 01:01.409
Or, uh
should I say...

01:01.452 --> 01:03.280
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
from "Airplane!"?

01:03.324 --> 01:06.414
No, he's my friend Steve.
You'll meet him.

01:06.457 --> 01:10.070
N-No,
I'm Sully Sullenberger.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.680
Chesley Burnett Sullenberger?

01:11.723 --> 01:15.118
A.K.A. the pilot who landed
the plane on the Hudson River?

01:15.162 --> 01:17.425
Ooh, ooh!
Guess mine.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.169
The Hamburglar?

01:22.212 --> 01:23.735
Clearly,
you're wage theft.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.911
Ah! Exactly!

01:27.087 --> 01:29.524
So that's the costume
you get?

01:43.233 --> 01:44.974
Happy Halloween, y'all!

01:45.017 --> 01:49.326
Reap the whirlwind of Storm!

01:49.370 --> 01:53.591
Look at all these
bee-autiful costumes.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.245
Hey, baby!

01:56.855 --> 01:58.118
Oh, I love Halloween.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.120
Best holiday-- by far.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.905
Disguises, crime, lookin' hot?

02:02.948 --> 02:04.907
These are my specialties.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.561
We're both
Scarlet Witch!

02:06.604 --> 02:09.085
We look exactly the same.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.434
Yeah, I don't know
about exact.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.610
I started working on my costume
in July.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.960
So did I! Look.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.398
That costume is trash.

02:17.441 --> 02:20.401
Oh, look, Mr. Johnson,
he's you!

02:20.444 --> 02:21.793
That's pretty cute.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.926
But I didn't approve
my likeness rights.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.450
You better lawyer up, kid.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.843
Let's play
the mirror game.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.366
Or you know what?

02:29.410 --> 02:31.803
They turned the library
into a haunted house,

02:31.847 --> 02:33.109
and they're keeping
all the candy in there

02:33.153 --> 02:34.197
till the end of the day

02:34.241 --> 02:35.503
when they hand it out
to the kids,

02:35.546 --> 02:37.635
so why don't you go in there
and guard the candy?

02:37.679 --> 02:39.202
Doesn't that
sound like fun?

02:39.246 --> 02:40.638
That sounds super boring.

02:40.682 --> 02:41.857
You said you didn't want to play
the mirror game,

02:41.900 --> 02:42.988
but it honestly
feels like we are.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.599
It's crazy.

02:46.035 --> 02:46.992
Ah.

02:47.036 --> 02:49.386
Black Frank Abagnale Jr.!

02:51.867 --> 02:53.129
Uh-- Uh-oh.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.523
Somebody's going hard
in the paint.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.133
Bewm, bewm, beww!

02:57.177 --> 02:58.439
That is the best
and maybe only

02:58.482 --> 03:00.223
James Harden costume
I've ever seen.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.312
Thank you.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.184
Oh, my God.
Did you see Jacob's costume?

03:04.227 --> 03:05.228
He's wage theft.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.316
I guessed it
on the first try.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.318
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.841
- That is a good costume.
- Thank you.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.104
Yes, millennial
Tuskegee airman.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.280
I love that.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.674
"Red Tails"?
So underrated.

03:16.718 --> 03:17.719
Oh! Ooh.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.853
Ha-ha! Got him.

03:21.897 --> 03:25.857
I knew he was a regular Tuskegee
airman, not a millennial one.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.598
Did you see his face?

03:29.818 --> 03:31.515
Where is it?

03:31.559 --> 03:32.777
Oh.

03:33.735 --> 03:37.173
Ooh, she a basketball fan.[ Laughs ] I am.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.348
Hey, Amber.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.045
- What are you dressed as?
- A bad bitch.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.221
Oh, language.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.439
Okay, see you later.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.224
Good morning, everyone.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.138
Janine?

03:46.182 --> 03:49.272
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. Erika?

03:49.316 --> 03:50.752
I haven't seen you
since high school.

03:50.795 --> 03:51.666
I know!

03:51.709 --> 03:53.058
It's been forever!
I know.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.060
Last time I saw you
was at our graduation party.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.888
Yeah.
You brought
"Trivial Pursuit."

03:56.932 --> 03:58.455
Yes, and people had fun
playing it

03:58.499 --> 03:59.891
in between
illegal drinking.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.153
What are you doing here?

04:01.197 --> 04:02.677
Oh, well, I guess my nephew's
in your class.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.548
He's dressed
as Baby Thanos.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.463
I'm helping my sister
with dropoff this week.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.422
How are you doing, though?

04:08.465 --> 04:10.902
I saw on Facebook
you and Tariq broke up.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.427
He made a memorial page for your
relationship and everything.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.429
Yeah, I asked him
not to do that.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.692
Um, but, yeah, I'm--
I'm doing fine.

04:17.735 --> 04:18.693
Just had to take
a step back...

04:18.736 --> 04:19.911
Oh, oh. ...sorry...

04:19.955 --> 04:21.086
It's okay....from the relationship.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.740
No, it's okay. Yeah.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.960
Oh! Did you hear about Malik
and Brandy's party tonight?

04:25.003 --> 04:26.527
You going?
I was invited,

04:26.570 --> 04:29.094
but they were always
more of Tariq's friends.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.095
Oh, all right. Yeah.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.314
Well, my girl Michelle

04:31.358 --> 04:32.663
throwing a Halloween party
tonight, too.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.622
You should come through!
Oh, no board games.

04:34.665 --> 04:37.320
Thank you,
um, but, you know,

04:37.364 --> 04:38.930
I-I actually have plans already.

04:38.974 --> 04:39.975
Okay.
Yeah.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.324
Cool.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.804
Erika's super nice
from what I remember,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.936
but I just don't know her
that well.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.331
And I won't know anyone
at that party.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.898
And I really do
have plans tonight.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.422
I put up a camera to try to keep
kids from egging my house,

04:52.466 --> 04:55.164
and, as of this morning,
it has not worked.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.645
But maybe tonight.

04:57.688 --> 04:58.863
- You busy, it's cool.
- Yeah.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.952
Whoa, whoa, Louis, hey!
Baby Thanos!

05:00.996 --> 05:02.911
No candy until the end
of the day.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.173
Oh, my bad.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.348
I passed out the little
candy bags we made,

05:05.392 --> 05:06.567
but I'll take 'em back.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.959
Okay.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.352
But it's Halloween!

05:09.396 --> 05:12.137
We should be able to have
candy whenever we want!

05:12.181 --> 05:13.443
Oh.
Ooh.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.923
That boy loves his candy.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.142
Yeah, well, we try to wait
until the end of the day

05:17.186 --> 05:18.796
to pass out candy,
you know?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.929
Make sure the parents have
to deal with the sugar rushes.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.235
Oh, okay. And that's why
I'm glad to be the aunt.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.064
Thank you.

05:26.108 --> 05:29.329
Oh, and can you
give this to Gregory?

05:29.372 --> 05:31.113
To Mr. Eddie?
Mm-hmm.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.593
Something special in it.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.682
Oh, my God, drugs?

05:34.725 --> 05:36.423
No.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.776
Now that's a bad bitch.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.691
- I know. Every morning.
- She looks amazing.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.170
- Even Mondays.
- Does she take Pilates?

05:45.214 --> 05:46.433
I don't know.

05:50.959 --> 05:51.873
Hey, Ashley.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.178
Got more candy
for the stash.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.355
I'm so bored.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.878
This is hell.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.359
'Kay.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.490
Oh, hey, Ron Burgundy.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.057
Oh, look at you--
you shaved.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.886
Look, I got this bag of candy
from Joel and Carolina's mom.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.409
She wanted me
to give it to you.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.845
Maybe she wants you to get
a cavity or something.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.413
Oh. That's nice of her,
but no thanks.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.024
I truly hate candy
unless it's 96% cacao.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.113
Uh, but you can hang on to that,
and I'll tell her thank you.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.419
Okay.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.029
Well, thank you to your
donation to my mouth.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.770
Sorry, no.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.035
Ooh, Werther's!

06:25.472 --> 06:29.127
"Here's a little extra
something sweet."

06:41.444 --> 06:43.533
Am I going to steal this candy?

06:43.577 --> 06:45.622
We shall see.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.503
Okay.
So, what did we learn?

06:56.546 --> 06:59.462
Don't go to Salem.
Or Boston.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.072
You know what?
Just skip the whole state.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.770
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

07:02.813 --> 07:05.120
Guys, what has gotten
into you today?

07:05.163 --> 07:06.208
Gu-- Come on.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.383
They're really
on one today.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.218
Ava, could you please
come out here?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.959
- No. Stop right now.
- I said have a seat.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.222
You know you're not
supposed to be doing that.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.180
What the...?

07:35.063 --> 07:37.544
Witch!

07:37.587 --> 07:39.763
No candy until the end
of the day.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.286
Enjoy the haunted house.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.723
Hello?

07:42.766 --> 07:44.855
Where's the candy
that's supposed to be here?

07:44.899 --> 07:47.075
Oh, hey.
The candy's right--

07:51.906 --> 07:53.864
Oh, dang.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.301
Where'd the candy go?

07:56.345 --> 07:58.173
Guys, what is going on?

08:00.175 --> 08:02.569
Where did you get this?

08:02.612 --> 08:04.309
What is in your mouth?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.275
What is going on?!

08:13.318 --> 08:15.059
What? What the-- What?

08:15.103 --> 08:16.844
Oh!

08:16.887 --> 08:18.933
What does it look like, boy?

08:18.976 --> 08:20.500
They got
into the candy bag!

08:20.543 --> 08:21.718
Hey, watch it!

08:21.762 --> 08:23.328
Need to get my deposit
back on this.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.156
What the hell
is happening?!

08:25.200 --> 08:26.462
It was her.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.724
She's too absorbed
looking at that damn phone

08:27.768 --> 08:29.073
she let the candy
get stolen.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.249
Alleged phone,
alleged candy.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.599
Well, I saw those bags.

08:32.642 --> 08:33.904
That's two Halloweens'
worth of candy.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.645
How did they even pass it out
so fast?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.865
Yeah, and what kid shares candy
on Halloween?

08:37.908 --> 08:39.388
We're dealing with
a real sicko here.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.999
The important thing to focus on
is that no one person

08:42.043 --> 08:43.740
is to blame,
except of course the thief.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.742
Because, in a way, I've been
robbed, when you think about it.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.744
We need to find
who took the candy.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.920
We'll get to that,
but firstly, there's no way

08:49.964 --> 08:52.096
we can teach these children
when they are like this.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.011
They need to burn
that energy off.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.535
They can't go outside,
it's raining.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.753
It's--
Hey!

08:56.797 --> 08:58.233
Little gremlins!

08:58.276 --> 08:59.364
Free recess in the gym!

09:01.453 --> 09:04.282
I'm one of those people where
chaos really affects my mood,

09:04.326 --> 09:06.850
so I'm just gonna call it a day.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.644
What are you doing?
Let me show you how it's done.

09:17.687 --> 09:18.862
Truth zone?

09:18.906 --> 09:20.342
I'm feeling
a little conflicted

09:20.385 --> 09:22.866
about the constitutionality
of stop and frisk, okay?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.869
All right.
Let's remove your hat, bear.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.392
I feel like Eric Adams.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.872
Okay.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.919
All right,
that's the last of them.

09:31.962 --> 09:34.617
Now to put this candy
contraband someplace safe.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.968
Oh, I have a human-sized sa--
uh, a, uh--

09:38.012 --> 09:40.928
a safe that's bigger than
a breadbox in one of my closets.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.451
Wait.
How big is it?

09:42.494 --> 09:44.235
I've been looking for a safe
place to keep my other safes.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.934
Oh. Look, you two
guard the door,

09:46.977 --> 09:48.370
make sure the kids
don't leave,

09:48.413 --> 09:49.719
and we will be right back.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.329
Okay.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.465
You know, when I woke up
this morning,

09:56.508 --> 09:57.901
I did not expect my day
to include

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
patting down the students
for candy.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.775
Oh! That reminds me.

10:03.733 --> 10:07.258
Um,
so Joel and Carolina's mom

10:07.302 --> 10:10.044
left that for you in the bag
of candy you didn't want.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.088
Oh, thanks.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.873
Mm-hmm.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.744
Her phone number.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.485
Yeah.
Nice.

10:16.528 --> 10:17.704
Yeah.

10:17.747 --> 10:18.705
Good penmanship.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.097
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.099
Yeah. Guess she has a thing
for Kevin Hart

10:22.143 --> 10:23.535
in "Soul Plane."

10:23.579 --> 10:24.711
One, he did not play
a pilot in that.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.756
Two, we, as a society,
do not talk

10:26.800 --> 10:29.063
about Sully Sullenberger enough.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.413
I'd say
he's had his time.

10:31.456 --> 10:36.766
He landed an Airbus
of 155 people safely on a river!

10:36.810 --> 10:38.115
Okay,
I'm just saying that,

10:38.159 --> 10:40.422
as a pilot, like,
half his job is landing,

10:40.465 --> 10:42.293
so he kind of was
just doing his job.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.121
- Wow!
- Shouldn't have had a movie
before Harriet Tubman.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.036
Tom Hanks
can't play her.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.429
And I don't know why that's
- Mr. Sullenberger's problem.
- Wha--

10:47.472 --> 10:50.301
I will not rest until the world
gives that man

10:50.345 --> 10:52.260
the respect
that he deserves!

10:52.303 --> 10:53.304
Okay.
Okay?

10:53.348 --> 10:54.610
- All right.
- I'm serious about this.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.611
- I see.
- I'm really passionate.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.352
I understand.

10:59.528 --> 11:00.790
So,
are you gonna take Amber

11:00.834 --> 11:04.141
to some kind of pilot party
tonight?

11:04.185 --> 11:06.143
No.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.579
Friends
are dragging me out.

11:07.623 --> 11:08.929
Oh.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.495
They've been doing that
a lot now that I'm single.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.671
Oh.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
That's nice of them.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.500
Y-Yeah, yeah, um...

11:15.544 --> 11:16.763
It was a lot at first.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.461
- Mm.
- But it is nice, actually.

11:21.550 --> 11:25.510
Have your friends been doing
the same since the breakup?

11:25.554 --> 11:28.078
Oh, yeah. Well, no. Oh.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.906
But Jacob did take me out
to a drag

11:29.950 --> 11:32.126
"Settlers of Catan" brunch,
and that was fun.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.128
Yeah, that sounds fun.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.869
Yeah.

11:35.912 --> 11:39.176
But what about your
outside-of-work friends?

11:39.220 --> 11:40.351
Um...

11:40.395 --> 11:41.875
Oh, my--
my outside-of-work friends?

11:41.918 --> 11:43.137
Um... Jacob: I'm just saying,

11:43.180 --> 11:44.181
you didn't have
to lock me in the safe

11:44.225 --> 11:45.400
to show me
how big it is.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.706
Eh, quit whinin'.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.011
What's going on
in there now?

11:50.753 --> 11:52.494
Yeah, they've locked
the doors.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.583
Kitchen window.

11:54.626 --> 11:55.932
I'm sorry, y'all.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.543
Yes!

11:58.587 --> 12:02.199
Baby Thanos!

12:02.243 --> 12:05.942
He stole the candy bag?
I should've known.

12:05.986 --> 12:09.511
Dear God,
can we not know peace?

12:09.554 --> 12:12.688
Clear a path.
And no one try and stop me.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.433
Ooh.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.087
Oh, Lord. Get him.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.437
You--Barbara: Come on-- Jacob.

12:33.230 --> 12:33.970
Hyah!

12:34.014 --> 12:35.580
Okay, all right, okay.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.843
All right. Okay!

12:36.886 --> 12:38.583
Yeah.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.021
Help!

12:41.064 --> 12:43.023
Oh, my!
Hey!

12:43.937 --> 12:45.155
- Hey!
- Cut it-- Cut it out!

12:45.199 --> 12:46.853
Did anybody see where
Baby Thanos went?

12:46.896 --> 12:48.332
He has to be
in here somewhere.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.160
Baby Thanos: <i>It's Halloween.</i>

12:50.204 --> 12:51.858
<i>Kids deserve candy.</i>

12:51.901 --> 12:53.903
<i>It's not fair
to keep it from us.</i>

12:53.947 --> 12:57.080
<i>I am inedible!</i>

12:58.386 --> 13:00.170
I think he means,
"I am inevitable."

13:00.214 --> 13:02.956
- Yeah, okay.
- Mm, Baby Theranos
is in Ava's office!

13:02.999 --> 13:07.134
<i>And I've only passed out
half the bag so far.</i>

13:07.177 --> 13:10.790
Looks like we're gonna need
a bigger trash can.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.139
Oh,
we gotta get this kid.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.097
But somebody absolutely needs
to stay here.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.359
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.621
I'll stay.

13:16.665 --> 13:17.884
I've been training
for this my whole life.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.015
Storm's a-brewin'!

13:22.192 --> 13:23.541
And he's gone![ Sighs ] No.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.021
Well, the kid's good,
I'll give him that.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.110
We must have
just missed him.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.198
Ooh.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.636
Still fresh.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.637
Ooh!

13:32.681 --> 13:34.814
The kid is on the run.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.424
Oh.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.951
And that door leads
to the basement.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.042
The ghost janitor.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.176
Mr. Johnson said
there's a ghost janitor

13:49.219 --> 13:51.134
that lives down there.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.484
A-And obviously
I don't believe that.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.270
You know, because I am
a grown-up person.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.838
So, you'll go look for
Baby Thanos in the basement?

13:58.881 --> 14:02.406
Yeah, I will accompany you, Gregory,

14:02.450 --> 14:03.668
if you're scared.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.887
Oh.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.062
Search the basement.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.890
We will search the hall.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.283
Throw us a bone, please.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.632
Amen.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.157
You wanna--
You wanna go first?

14:14.201 --> 14:16.159
'Cause I-I don't have
a preference, really.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.073
I...

14:21.251 --> 14:23.166
Hey, what are you guys
doing tonight?

14:23.210 --> 14:25.865
Oh, I've got some
consoling to do.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.214
Why's that?

14:27.257 --> 14:28.519
Gary,
the vending machine guy,

14:28.563 --> 14:30.173
he has a hard time
with Halloween.

14:30.217 --> 14:33.133
Like, every house turns
into a vending machine.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.569
I never thought
of it that way.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.657
Mm-hmm.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.528
Yeah,
that does sound tough.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.269
But, uh, Barbara,
what are you doing tonight?

14:39.313 --> 14:42.969
I'm going to a screening
of "Rocky Horror" at my church.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.059
They take out
all the cursing,

14:46.102 --> 14:48.800
all the references
to sex and sexuality.

14:48.844 --> 14:53.849
It comes in at just under
26 minutes, and it is a hoot!

14:53.893 --> 14:55.198
It's a yearly tradition.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.331
We've watched
"Nightmare Before Christmas,"

14:57.374 --> 14:58.985
but only the Christmas parts,

14:59.028 --> 15:01.291
"Practical Magic"
without the witchcraft,

15:01.335 --> 15:05.905
and "Hocus Pocus"
without Sarah Jessica Parker.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.037
Ooh, that sounds fun!
Can I come?

15:08.081 --> 15:10.735
Oh, sweetheart, it has been
sold out for months.

15:10.779 --> 15:13.738
Yeah, you are a newly single
NBA All Star.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.305
You must have plans.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.177
Well, I did,
but then I decided

15:17.220 --> 15:18.874
I wanted to hang out
with my friends.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.963
Well, respectfully, kiddo,
we've been over this.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.573
We're not really
your friends.

15:22.617 --> 15:25.185
Yes, no, I know, of course.
It's just...

15:25.228 --> 15:27.665
you guys are the only people
I kinda hang out with, so...

15:27.709 --> 15:29.450
Only? Why?

15:31.408 --> 15:35.151
Look, ever since I broke up
with Tariq,

15:35.195 --> 15:37.197
I don't have any friends.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.201
And I realize
that's kinda on me.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.638
Janine, you're young.

15:43.681 --> 15:46.380
There's so many ways
for you to make friends.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.163
Mm-hmm.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.556
What's the problem?

15:49.644 --> 15:52.429
It just feels really hard
to start over.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.562
I've started over
tons of times.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.955
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.913
Let me tell you something,
it sucks.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.088
Great.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.960
No, it's scary at first,
but you do it.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.136
- You know why?
- Absolutely, Melissa.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.659
I didn't
make my point yet.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.313
I fully wasn't listening.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.055
Okay, point is that
it is way scarier

16:09.098 --> 16:10.708
to not put yourself
out there.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.276
You don't wanna be the lonely
old lady sitting at home

16:13.320 --> 16:16.758
on Halloween hoping no one eggs
your house, right?

16:16.801 --> 16:18.890
Oh, yeah, no,
of course not.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.414
Yeah.
Not me.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.807
I think I've been avoiding
making new friends because

16:22.851 --> 16:24.984
the unknown, it's scary.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.030
But it is Halloween,
the time to face your fears--

16:28.074 --> 16:31.164
ghosts, ghouls, and new friends.

16:34.341 --> 16:38.040
Do you feel,
like, a cold spot?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.781
No.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.831
Did you hear that?

16:46.875 --> 16:51.010
It's just the sound
of a normal school basement.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.670
And are you
seeing that?

16:59.714 --> 17:01.368
Yes. You don't have
to keep asking.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.457
We're having the same experience.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.461
Okay, when I say run,
we run.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.514
Welp, I didn't find
Baby Thanos,

17:17.558 --> 17:20.213
but I did find
my favorite mop from '04.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.519
She's still got it.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.521
Jacob,
it's just Mr. J--

17:39.580 --> 17:40.885
You!

17:40.929 --> 17:42.061
Me!

17:42.104 --> 17:43.540
Why?

17:43.584 --> 17:45.151
It's Halloween!

17:46.674 --> 17:47.936
No!

17:47.979 --> 17:49.155
What are you doing?

17:49.198 --> 17:50.808
It's chaos out there, man.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.115
And you're only making
my job harder.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.552
I have to do this.
It's the only way.

17:55.596 --> 17:59.078
Dude, I traded
an eighth grader for that!

17:59.121 --> 18:00.731
What did it cost?

18:02.951 --> 18:04.431
Everything.

18:06.389 --> 18:07.651
Oh, my goodness.

18:07.695 --> 18:08.913
They're out.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.437
Oh, Ava.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.484
- Oh.
- Ooh, what happened
to your face?

18:14.528 --> 18:16.312
I did my job is what happened
to my face.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.835
Did you guys find
Baby Thanos?

18:17.879 --> 18:20.621
No, we came to see if maybe
he scurried back in here.

18:20.664 --> 18:24.233
That child is slipperier
than a buttered otter.

18:24.277 --> 18:27.018
Excuse me? Adults?

18:27.062 --> 18:28.368
Chad!

18:28.411 --> 18:30.021
You found Baby Thanos?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.327
Where? How?

18:31.371 --> 18:34.461
Just followed the trash.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.464
I'll see you in court,
you little

18:37.507 --> 18:39.509
Let's go get you cleaned up.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.817
Aah! No!

18:42.860 --> 18:44.819
Noooo!
Oh!

18:46.168 --> 18:48.214
Get some rest, guys.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.477
Something
like maybe Beyoncé.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.434
Really?

18:55.177 --> 18:56.657
Hey, Janine!

18:57.223 --> 18:58.267
Hey, Erika.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.139
Hey, is that offer still
on the table

19:00.182 --> 19:01.444
to go to a party tonight?

19:01.488 --> 19:03.359
Yeah, of course!
Yeah?

19:03.403 --> 19:04.752
Okay, cool.
Well, I wanna go.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.102
Um, do you think
I'll know anybody there?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.625
I mean, you'll know me.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.192
But I'll introduce you
to everybody.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.151
I promise, it's a good group
of people.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.587
Okay, cool.
Sounds fun.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.936
Cool!

19:14.979 --> 19:16.981
Oh, you do have a sexier
costume, though, right?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.287
Oh, for sure.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.854
I have an Eric André wig--Absolutely not.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.378
Okay, I will find
- something else to wear.
- Good.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.293
Oh! Sugar crash?

19:24.337 --> 19:26.991
Oh, yeah, he ate, um,
a lot of candy.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.254
A lot. Okay.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.994
Well, sounds like a problem
for his mom.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.126
Yeah, exactly.
Mm-hmm.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.736
All right. Bye.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.390
- I'll see you later.
- See you tonight.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.785
I'm actually kind of excited
for tonight.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.221
I get to start over.

19:39.265 --> 19:43.225
I am telling you, I saw
the ghost janitor down there.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.053
Okay?
The story is real.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.489
You saw Mr. Johnson.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.751
- Mystery solved.
- No.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.798
No, no, no, this was
something else.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.321
Something sinister.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.845
Okay, Shaggy.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.178
If this one doesn't work,
we should try that sexy

20:23.222 --> 20:24.440
- Walmart greeter costume.
- Ava?

20:24.484 --> 20:25.659
You know the school day's over, right?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.226
Yes, I do.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.880
What,
you trying to celebrate?

20:29.924 --> 20:30.881
Why you still here?

20:30.925 --> 20:32.274
Oh, I'm just waiting on...

20:32.318 --> 20:34.972
B-i-i-i-i-i-itch!

20:35.016 --> 20:36.844
Yeah? Okay.
Yes!

20:36.887 --> 20:39.934
Obviously I look better in it,
then Marilyn,

20:39.977 --> 20:41.892
but honestly, then you.

20:41.936 --> 20:42.980
Okay.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.634
Tell her how good she looks, Gregory.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.463
Uh, y-yeah, yeah, no, you look,
um-- it looks great.

20:47.507 --> 20:48.899
Really form-fitting.

20:48.943 --> 20:49.944
Gross.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.424
Thank you.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.425
Good night, Mr. Johnson.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.904
Have a happy Halloween!

20:53.948 --> 20:55.602
Happy Halloween.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.444
Like that?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.837
I had it made at Dorney Park.
