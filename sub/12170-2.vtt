Hello?

02:37.900 --> 02:39.040
Oh!

04:10.670 --> 04:12.170
Hello!

04:12.230 --> 04:13.730
Granddad!

04:13.800 --> 04:14.820
Hi!

04:14.870 --> 04:16.410
Oh, hello!

04:17.829 --> 04:19.550
You gotta be careful with Granddad.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.550
He is a very, very old person.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.120
Now, should we put your shoes on?

04:24.170 --> 04:25.550
Are these yours?

04:25.600 --> 04:26.550
Oh, that's very nice!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.050
Thank you very much.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.350
Do you want to put that one on?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.250
You do right and I'll do left.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.350
That's a great picture.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.350
Uh, yeah.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.250
Well, no, I've got the morning off,

04:35.300 --> 04:40.200
but I'll be back at
2:00 at the station, yep.

04:40.270 --> 04:45.530
So if I take you to Africa,
yeah, with Mommy and Daddy,

04:45.600 --> 04:47.750
which animals would you like to see?

04:47.800 --> 04:48.820
Elephants.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.520
Elephants, yeah, any others?

04:50.570 --> 04:52.400
Um... lions?

04:52.470 --> 04:53.780
Oh, quite scary.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.550
Would you like to go up close to a lion?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.000
No.

04:57.070 --> 05:00.300
Do you know where an
elephant packs his clothes?

05:00.370 --> 05:01.570
No.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.920
Well, an elephant packs his clothes

05:02.970 --> 05:05.170
in his trunk, of course.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
And they've got very good memories.

05:06.770 --> 05:07.820
Do you have a good memory?

05:07.870 --> 05:08.450
Yeah.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.650
Good.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.050
Elephants have got the
best memories of all.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.850
Right, so we have to get as
many basil leaves as we can

05:14.900 --> 05:16.120
in ten seconds.

05:16.170 --> 05:16.780
Oh, you missed one!

05:16.830 --> 05:18.720
Missed one, missed one!

05:18.770 --> 05:19.620
No, you got one, you got two...

05:19.670 --> 05:20.320
It's me!

05:20.370 --> 05:21.280
Oh, look who it is!

05:21.330 --> 05:24.130
Go and say hello to Mommy, quickly!

05:25.530 --> 05:27.130
Mommy!

05:27.200 --> 05:30.030
Oh, hello!

05:30.100 --> 05:31.480
Did you have a nice time with Granddad?

05:31.530 --> 05:32.650
Yes.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.780
Yes, we did.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.180
We actually went to a cake shop.

05:36.230 --> 05:37.870
Oh, did you?

05:37.930 --> 05:39.280
Oh, what's that?

05:39.330 --> 05:41.480
Granddad caught a robber!

05:41.530 --> 05:42.680
Actually, we were walking the dog.

05:42.730 --> 05:44.220
I was walking the dog,

05:44.270 --> 05:45.820
and there was a big slippery rock.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.680
It was covered in seaweed,
and I just went "Whoosh!"

05:48.730 --> 05:50.080
And I fell.

05:50.130 --> 05:51.820
Come on, let's finish this.

05:51.870 --> 05:54.330
Granddad's a policeman.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.540
Yes, I am a policeman.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.220
So, how much pasta do we need?

05:59.270 --> 06:01.830
One, two, three...

06:01.880 --> 06:02.820
Oh, that's nice.

06:02.870 --> 06:04.450
I like what you've done there.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.320
Do you want to use that one to just...

06:06.370 --> 06:08.920
Because if you see, on Granddad's grass,

06:08.970 --> 06:10.320
he's got a little red at the top,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.420
but he's also got a little
white on the wings, hasn't he,

06:12.470 --> 06:14.080
which you've got.

06:14.130 --> 06:15.150
Hello?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.220
Oh look, it's Daddy!

06:16.270 --> 06:17.570
Kurt.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.520
Hi, Hans.

06:18.570 --> 06:19.450
Hi!

06:19.500 --> 06:20.380
Hello?

06:20.430 --> 06:21.180
Grandpa!

06:21.230 --> 06:21.980
Hello?

06:22.030 --> 06:23.350
Hello!

06:23.400 --> 06:25.250
What are you doing here?

06:25.300 --> 06:26.020
Long story.

06:26.070 --> 06:28.300
Oh, my little Klara.

06:28.370 --> 06:29.800
Kurt!

06:29.870 --> 06:31.220
They've been keeping us apart.

06:31.270 --> 06:33.820
If I had known that you
were coming, we'd have...

06:33.870 --> 06:35.280
When was the last time?

06:35.330 --> 06:36.980
Klara's christening?

06:37.030 --> 06:38.120
Hello.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.840
Hello, Linda.

06:40.430 --> 06:43.170
Now, who do you think this is for?

06:44.930 --> 06:46.150
I've just been helping Dad.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.920
He's just here for the afternoon.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.400
Okay.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.120
How's the police?

06:51.170 --> 06:52.880
Yes, uh, not bad.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.530
Wow!

06:54.600 --> 06:56.120
Oh, Haåkon, you shouldn't have!

06:56.170 --> 06:58.310
Mom, it's a dollhouse!

06:58.370 --> 06:59.850
Thank you, Grandpa.

06:59.900 --> 07:04.170
Who do you think could
live in here and here?

07:04.230 --> 07:07.030
Grandfathers are meant to spoil.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.020
Isn't that right, Kurt?

07:09.070 --> 07:11.120
I have to get back to work, unfortunately.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.920
You're coming to my birthday party?

07:12.970 --> 07:14.220
Um...

07:14.270 --> 07:16.350
It's about time we got to know each other.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.650
Wednesday.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.050
Please come -- everyone else is.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.480
Sure, yeah, okay.

07:21.530 --> 07:23.770
Thank you.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.550
Let's go and find some friends!

07:25.600 --> 07:27.420
I don't even have a suit.

07:27.470 --> 07:29.100
You do.

07:29.170 --> 07:30.250
He's only asking me to be polite.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.380
He doesn't want me to
come to his birthday party.

07:32.430 --> 07:33.650
Linda, do you want to...?

07:33.700 --> 07:34.750
Yeah.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.180
I'll call you.

07:36.230 --> 07:37.150
Look after yourself, Dad.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.150
Yeah.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.420
Bye, Hans, see you.

07:39.470 --> 07:40.580
Bye bye, Klara!

07:40.630 --> 07:42.230
Grandpa, no!

08:31.170 --> 08:32.309
Hi.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.940
Thank you.

08:39.669 --> 08:40.919
What have you done?

08:40.970 --> 08:42.240
Oh...

08:43.700 --> 08:45.180
What is this?

08:45.230 --> 08:47.500
Missing person?

08:47.570 --> 08:49.080
Oh yeah, that's some old woman

08:49.130 --> 08:51.420
who's gone off from her old folks' home.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.420
Eliasson's gone out to help.

08:53.470 --> 08:53.980
He's fine.

08:54.030 --> 08:55.930
Well, I'll...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.220
You know, I'm supposed to
be mentoring him, so I'll...

08:58.270 --> 09:02.630
Are you okay?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.050
Yeah, I just slipped off a ladder, yeah.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.050
It's fine.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.640
All right.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.050
So, on the print-out being handed out,

09:27.100 --> 09:30.200
there's a picture of Anita
and also the local area.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.080
Now, she's believed to have been missing

09:32.130 --> 09:33.150
since about 9:00 this morning.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.230
We're gonna start our
search just over there,

09:36.300 --> 09:37.620
just beyond the tree.

09:37.670 --> 09:38.650
Oh, Kurt.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.720
I thought you could do with a hand.

09:39.770 --> 09:40.950
Thanks.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.750
What is the temperature
-- six, seven degrees?

09:42.800 --> 09:43.980
Yeah.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.180
And what was she dressed in?

09:45.230 --> 09:46.280
Just nightclothes.

09:46.330 --> 09:47.280
Right, sooner we go, the better.

09:47.330 --> 09:48.800
Let's go.

09:51.630 --> 09:52.970
Anita!

09:53.730 --> 09:55.070
Anita?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.900
Anita!

10:00.830 --> 10:02.170
Anita!

10:02.970 --> 10:04.730
Anita!

10:07.530 --> 10:09.330
There she is.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.400
Bring the blankets.

10:13.970 --> 10:16.020
Yeah, we've found her.

10:16.070 --> 10:17.180
The field through the trees.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.150
Copy that.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.320
There's nothing to worry about, Anita.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.000
It's fine.

10:22.070 --> 10:24.050
It's all gonna be okay, Anita.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.550
Come on, let's get you
up, let's get you up.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.830
Anita, my name's Kurt.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.980
My name's Kurt.

10:29.030 --> 10:30.750
Please! Please!

10:30.800 --> 10:32.050
Please!

10:32.100 --> 10:33.780
Let's get you back home, get you warm.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.250
Please! Please!

10:35.300 --> 10:37.220
Let's get you warm.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.330
Please, please...

10:42.070 --> 10:43.380
Please!

10:43.430 --> 10:46.330
Please! Please!

11:25.030 --> 11:26.880
Yeah, the woman is back in her home now.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.720
Eliasson's securing the scene.

11:28.770 --> 11:31.150
She's been dead a few days, we think.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.950
One of our boys recognized
her -- Erika Hjelmqvist.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.680
Lived in Skaåne Tranas.

11:35.730 --> 11:37.050
Any children?

11:37.100 --> 11:38.480
Teenage daughter.

11:38.530 --> 11:39.680
And a husband?

11:39.730 --> 11:41.800
Yeah, husband's dead.

14:17.070 --> 14:18.750
She was stabbed twice.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.080
There are also six or
seven deep defensive wounds

14:21.130 --> 14:22.520
on her hands and wrists.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.720
It looks like she may
have fled into the fields,

14:24.770 --> 14:25.880
fell into the ditch.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.430
No sign of a sexual assault.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.680
The weapon used had a serrated edge.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.720
Knife drawer in the kitchen
is tipped onto the floor.

14:32.770 --> 14:33.720
Bread knife, maybe?

14:33.770 --> 14:35.920
There will have been a lot of blood.

14:35.970 --> 14:38.730
Somebody tried to clean it up.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.580
Right, okay, so the urgent priority

14:40.630 --> 14:42.680
is locating the daughter,
Hannah Hjelmqvist.

14:42.730 --> 14:46.070
So school, social security
records, any friends.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.480
I'll talk to the neighbors, thanks.

14:47.530 --> 14:49.970
What happened?

14:50.030 --> 14:51.900
Uh... nothing.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.220
Is it Erika?

14:53.270 --> 14:54.880
It's not Hannah?

14:54.930 --> 14:56.120
I knew it would end in trouble.

14:56.170 --> 14:58.020
Do you have any idea
where Hannah might be?

14:58.070 --> 15:00.280
Well, we've been away two weeks.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.950
They were here just before we left.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.320
You said it would end in trouble.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.850
What were you talking about?

15:04.900 --> 15:05.950
The bikers.

15:06.000 --> 15:06.980
The motorcycle club.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.220
They make a hell of a lot of noise,

15:08.270 --> 15:10.150
come through here, 110k an hour.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.750
Which bikers?

15:11.800 --> 15:14.380
Well, Erika's husband got
into a row with this gang,

15:14.430 --> 15:15.920
or whatever they say they are.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.750
They rented a farm from him.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.850
Her husband Anders, he's
dead, is that correct?

15:19.900 --> 15:21.020
Last year.

15:21.070 --> 15:21.820
He went up there.

15:21.870 --> 15:23.980
He got into an argument.

15:24.030 --> 15:25.150
He came home, he had a heart attack.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.620
That was it.

15:26.670 --> 15:27.550
49.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.950
This was a violent argument?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.380
Pushing and shoving, I
think, but they just...

15:31.430 --> 15:32.880
You know, it was the stress of it.

15:32.930 --> 15:33.920
It was an accident waiting to happen.

15:33.970 --> 15:36.380
She's trying to have them evicted.

15:36.430 --> 15:37.480
Or was.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.580
Has Erika had any trouble with them since?

15:39.630 --> 15:41.050
All the time.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.870
Horrible.

15:42.930 --> 15:44.580
I'm going to ask one of my officers

15:44.630 --> 15:46.820
to take a more detailed
statement from you.

15:46.870 --> 15:49.120
Can you tell me where
the motorcycle club is?

15:49.170 --> 15:50.180
Towards Fyledalen.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.650
It's along there.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.620
You'll know it when you see it.

15:53.670 --> 15:54.180
All right, thank you.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.530
Thank you.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.920
Can you take her statement?

15:57.970 --> 15:59.240
Yeah.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.320
You're a policeman.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.130
Wallander.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.070
What's your name?

17:54.430 --> 17:56.480
A woman from Skaåne Tranas has been found

17:56.530 --> 17:58.450
stabbed in a field just
outside of the village.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.080
We think she's Erika Hjelmqvist.

18:00.130 --> 18:03.170
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:03.230 --> 18:06.100
Erika Hjelmqvist, who owns this farm.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.630
When you say stabbed, you mean she's dead?

18:13.700 --> 18:16.500
When was the last time you saw her?

18:20.450 --> 18:21.450
Her daughter Hannah is missing.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.440
Have you seen her?

18:30.600 --> 18:34.600
Well, if you hear anything about it

18:34.670 --> 18:38.930
or if you think of
anything, will you call me?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.530
Yeah, I'll call you.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.530
Hello?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.250
Hi Dad, it's me.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.270
Hi.

19:35.330 --> 19:39.530
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier -- Haåkon.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.850
What are you sorry about?

19:40.900 --> 19:42.620
The birthday party.

19:42.670 --> 19:43.850
It'd be nice if you could come, though.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.670
Their house is quite something.

19:46.730 --> 19:49.170
Uh, yeah...

19:49.230 --> 19:50.970
When was it?

19:51.030 --> 19:52.780
This Wednesday.

19:52.830 --> 19:54.580
Wednesday, Haåkon.

19:54.630 --> 19:55.850
It's a bit of a drive.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.430
Do you think you can make it?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.180
Yeah, yeah, I'll make sure.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.680
Oh, that would be great.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.220
Oh, and Klara wants to say goodnight.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.180
There you go, sweetie.

20:05.230 --> 20:07.670
Night night, Granddad!

20:07.730 --> 20:10.170
Night night, Klara Bo Bo Bo!

20:14.500 --> 20:15.750
All right.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.150
I'll speak to you soon, Dad.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.670
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.670
Good boy, good boy.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Good boy, come here.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.140
That's a good dog.

21:51.630 --> 21:53.630
Good boy, good boy.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.670
No!

22:20.720 --> 22:21.580
Wallander!

22:21.630 --> 22:22.480
Do you have any idea what happened?

22:22.530 --> 22:24.050
Detective, do you have a statement?

22:24.100 --> 22:26.520
Yeah, I'm sure that there
will be a statement,

22:26.570 --> 22:27.850
but it will be later in the morning,

22:27.900 --> 22:30.370
later in the morning, thanks.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.600
Kurt?

22:35.670 --> 22:37.930
Oh, hi.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.100
We found two blood traces at the house.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.970
DNA suggests it's mother and child.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.520
Three sets of fingerprints

22:47.570 --> 22:49.020
in the blood in the kitchen area.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.350
Erika's;

22:50.400 --> 22:51.520
Hannah's probably,

22:51.570 --> 22:53.580
judging by other prints in her bedroom;

22:53.630 --> 22:55.900
and one set unidentified.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.140
Come in, sit down.

23:01.030 --> 23:03.880
So, Hannah hasn't been seen
since the mother disappeared,

23:03.930 --> 23:05.720
which is approximately,
what, six days ago?

23:05.770 --> 23:06.920
Yep.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.520
We haven't found the mobile,

23:08.570 --> 23:10.820
but we know that it hasn't been used.

23:10.870 --> 23:12.350
So given the evidence,

23:12.400 --> 23:14.150
we need to work on the assumption

23:14.200 --> 23:15.950
that she was attacked
herself, potentially kidnapped.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.480
So what information do
we have about Hannah?

23:18.530 --> 23:19.750
Born in 2000,

23:19.800 --> 23:22.750
parents were Anders and Erika Hjelmqvist.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.520
Fostered by a family in Landskrona

23:24.570 --> 23:26.250
between the ages of five and nine.

23:26.300 --> 23:29.080
Reunited with her parents in March 2009.

23:29.130 --> 23:30.780
And why was she fostered?

23:30.830 --> 23:33.280
The mother had severe
post-natal depression --

23:33.330 --> 23:35.770
institutionalized briefly --

23:35.830 --> 23:38.350
and compounded by alcohol
dependency problems.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.120
And what detail do we have
on this motorcycle gang?

23:41.170 --> 23:44.700
Gustav Ericsson is the man
with his name on the lease.

23:44.770 --> 23:47.480
Long record: assault, drugs
-- possession, dealing.

23:47.530 --> 23:50.250
Spent six years in prison in
Copenhagen for manslaughter.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.550
What about this property dispute?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.880
Erika was trying to have them evicted.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.930
Standard landlord/tenant dispute.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.020
She started the proceedings
after her husband died.

24:00.070 --> 24:00.920
Who are the lawyers on that?

24:00.970 --> 24:02.350
Larsson, Skaåne Tranas.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.700
Yeah, I know her.

24:04.770 --> 24:06.220
So... right.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.430
You coordinate the vulnerable
and missing persons protocols,

24:09.500 --> 24:12.020
and I will talk to Rita Larsson.

24:12.070 --> 24:12.980
Yep, no problem.

24:13.030 --> 24:14.800
Thanks.

24:19.230 --> 24:20.350
Inspector?

24:20.400 --> 24:22.520
Detective, do you have any suspects?

24:22.570 --> 24:24.350
There's... we can't say anything.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.780
There's nothing to say.

24:25.830 --> 24:26.950
Can you tell me anything about Hannah?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.080
Have you found her?

24:28.130 --> 24:29.450
My colleagues are putting
together a statement.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.280
No, I'm not a journalist.

24:31.330 --> 24:33.380
We were fostered together, Hannah and me.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.880
Right, okay.

24:34.930 --> 24:35.950
Seven years ago.

24:36.000 --> 24:36.980
I just saw it.

24:37.030 --> 24:38.620
I read about her going missing, and...

24:38.670 --> 24:40.420
You see her recently, or heard from her?

24:40.470 --> 24:41.620
I'm just worried.

24:41.670 --> 24:43.470
Is she okay?

24:43.530 --> 24:45.180
We're doing everything we can to find her.

24:45.230 --> 24:47.180
Listen, I need you to give your details

24:47.230 --> 24:48.380
to Emma here on reception.

24:48.430 --> 24:50.750
We will definitely talk to you about this.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.070
Okay.

24:52.130 --> 24:54.280
I'm sorry I can't tell you
anything more at the moment,

24:54.330 --> 24:56.730
but thank you for coming in.

25:54.850 --> 25:55.850
Can I help you?

25:55.900 --> 25:56.980
Uh, I came...

25:57.030 --> 25:58.050
Lawyer...

25:58.100 --> 25:59.900
Larsson...

25:59.970 --> 26:02.220
Uh, Rita Larsson, lawyer's office.

26:02.270 --> 26:04.610
You're sitting outside it.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.070
Thanks, thanks.

26:24.430 --> 26:26.980
I've seen a lot of her
since her husband died.

26:27.030 --> 26:30.100
She tried very hard to
bring charges against them,

26:30.170 --> 26:32.020
but there was no violence.

26:32.070 --> 26:34.050
They didn't kill him.

26:34.100 --> 26:36.580
A lot of intimidation --
nothing illegal, though.

26:36.630 --> 26:40.200
But she became obsessed by it.

26:40.270 --> 26:43.030
She was very heavy-handed.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.920
Why do you think her
husband hired it to them

26:44.970 --> 26:46.080
in the first place?

26:46.130 --> 26:48.120
He leased it to the one
man -- Gustav Ericsson.

26:48.170 --> 26:51.530
He had no idea he'd bring
his friends with him.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.870
And how far on are you
in the eviction process?

26:55.930 --> 27:00.400
It's been registered as
an EM2 by the council.

27:00.470 --> 27:03.400
Means it shouldn't be long now.

27:03.470 --> 27:05.120
Is that public?

27:05.170 --> 27:06.950
Can people know about that in advance?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.120
No, but it's a small town, Kurt.

27:09.170 --> 27:13.170
They probably had some idea
which way the wind was blowing.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.050
Erika would have told them
about it if no one else did.

27:16.100 --> 27:19.600
She would've yelled it
through their letterbox.

27:21.180 --> 27:22.180
Right.

27:22.230 --> 27:23.320
Thanks, Rita.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.220
I appreciate that.

27:25.270 --> 27:28.250
I'd like permission to
search the biker place.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.580
There's a history of conflict

27:29.630 --> 27:31.150
between the Hjelmqvists and that group.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.580
I think it's likely that they knew

27:32.630 --> 27:33.650
they were going to be evicted.

27:33.700 --> 27:34.780
I'll chase it.

27:34.830 --> 27:36.050
It might take a couple of hours.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.300
I'll send Eliasson up
when he comes through.

27:41.230 --> 27:42.500
Kurt?

27:42.570 --> 27:44.310
Right, thanks.

28:15.230 --> 28:17.850
Now, if you'd just hold that down.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.240
Thanks.

28:21.330 --> 28:22.780
I mean, I'm not...

28:22.830 --> 28:24.330
I just...

28:24.400 --> 28:28.230
I don't know how it happened.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.870
I was just standing there.

28:30.930 --> 28:32.720
I was looking for my car, actually,

28:32.770 --> 28:34.680
and I heard motorbikes,

28:34.730 --> 28:37.220
and then I don't know
what happened after that.

28:37.270 --> 28:38.720
Well, you don't seem concussed.

28:38.770 --> 28:41.080
There's no sign of bleeding.

28:41.130 --> 28:44.230
It's very good you came in though, Kurt.

28:44.300 --> 28:45.320
Good.

28:45.370 --> 28:47.530
I mean, uh...

28:47.600 --> 28:50.100
I'm just, uh...

28:50.170 --> 28:52.030
What?

28:52.100 --> 28:55.930
I'm dizzy, on and off.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.680
Earlier today, out of nowhere, I...

28:57.730 --> 29:00.020
There's nothing unusual with your glucose.

29:00.070 --> 29:01.850
Are you eating?

29:01.900 --> 29:03.150
Yeah, I'm taking care of myself.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.750
I'm exercising regularly.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.180
How's your balance?

29:06.230 --> 29:07.150
Uh...

29:07.200 --> 29:10.970
Well, I don't know.

29:11.030 --> 29:14.500
There was a moment or two in South Africa

29:14.570 --> 29:18.400
where I was, uh...

29:18.470 --> 29:20.020
you know, light-headed
for a couple of minutes.

29:20.070 --> 29:21.320
I don't know if that's anything.

29:21.370 --> 29:23.580
Are they getting more
frequent, the dizzy spells?

29:23.630 --> 29:27.400
I don't really know.

29:27.470 --> 29:30.430
Diabetes is a serious condition, Kurt.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.680
You know that.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.420
I'm just, uh...

29:33.470 --> 29:34.740
What?

29:36.530 --> 29:39.000
I'm just, you know, thinking.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.870
About how my dad, uh...

29:46.300 --> 29:48.570
Kurt, don't overthink it.

29:48.630 --> 29:51.320
We will absolutely run some tests,

29:51.370 --> 29:55.330
but I am sure you'll be fine.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.850
You're 55.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.250
You've got a stressful
job, you're a diabetic,

29:59.300 --> 30:00.820
and you've just been beaten up,

30:00.870 --> 30:03.730
so don't work yourself up.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.350
You going to say I'm
not getting any younger?

30:05.400 --> 30:07.070
Well, who is?

30:14.170 --> 30:16.570
Thanks, that's a big, uh...

31:02.630 --> 31:04.120
We have a warrant to search your property

31:04.170 --> 31:07.150
for evidence pertaining to the
killing of Erika Hjelmqvist.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.000
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.140
We'll look in here first, thank you.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.580
You want anything?

31:17.630 --> 31:19.220
Coffee, or...?

31:19.270 --> 31:20.780
Or do you just want to look around,

31:20.830 --> 31:23.480
see where the corpses are buried?

31:23.530 --> 31:27.030
Thing is, you gave me warning,
coming round the other day.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.780
I've executed all the sex slaves

31:28.830 --> 31:30.550
and flushed their body
parts down the toilet.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.780
It would be helpful

31:31.830 --> 31:33.550
if you could give us names
and personal numbers

31:33.600 --> 31:34.520
of everyone who's here --

31:34.570 --> 31:35.150
anyone who lives here permanently,

31:35.200 --> 31:37.050
anyone who visits.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.420
That's gonna take a bit
of time to organize.

31:38.470 --> 31:39.480
I'd appreciate it, thank you.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.400
Look around in the meantime, why not?

31:45.230 --> 31:48.830
Shame people won't just
allow us to be somewhere.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.780
It's the only kindness I ask these days,

31:50.830 --> 31:52.650
just to be allowed to be somewhere,

31:52.700 --> 31:56.230
raise my boy in peace.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.780
It's our sixth place in ten years.

31:57.830 --> 31:59.970
Why is that?

32:00.030 --> 32:01.480
Isn't going to do you any good asking me.

32:01.530 --> 32:02.820
Ask them.

32:02.870 --> 32:04.180
Ask her.

32:04.230 --> 32:05.720
Get your Ouija board and ask her.

32:05.770 --> 32:08.570
I don't have a problem with people.

32:10.100 --> 32:14.800
I did six years for
manslaughter, as you know.

32:14.870 --> 32:16.120
I missed my son being born.

32:16.170 --> 32:17.250
I missed him being a child.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.300
That's something that hurts me every day.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.700
You will not find a
single bloody thing here.

32:32.530 --> 32:33.620
You do the barn, yeah?

32:33.670 --> 32:34.940
Sure.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.870
Kurt!

34:35.429 --> 34:36.650
Is this yours, sir?

34:36.699 --> 34:37.750
You know bloody well it's not mine.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.150
I'll cut your bloody throat with it.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.400
Will you just calm down?

34:42.230 --> 34:43.250
I'll cut your neck open!

34:43.300 --> 34:44.679
Will you just calm down?

34:44.730 --> 34:46.070
Look...

34:49.500 --> 34:51.050
Stand back, all of you!

34:51.100 --> 34:53.040
Put your hands up!

35:01.470 --> 35:03.080
Sorry I have to go.

35:03.130 --> 35:04.480
I don't really want to.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.530
Go, it's fine.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.950
They're going to take some
getting through anyway.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.450
All right, well, call me
if there's anything at all.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.120
Anything about Hannah.

35:13.170 --> 35:14.440
Sure.

36:14.030 --> 36:16.480
♪ Slow strokes as we shine the chrome ♪

36:16.530 --> 36:19.330
♪ I'm all wrapped up in styrofoam ♪

36:51.430 --> 36:53.230
Good afternoon.

37:20.350 --> 37:21.350
Thank you.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.940
Thank you.

37:35.470 --> 37:36.680
Kurt!

37:36.730 --> 37:37.920
Louise.

37:37.970 --> 37:41.070
I hope it wasn't too
long a journey for you.

37:41.130 --> 37:43.670
No, it, uh...

37:43.730 --> 37:44.980
What a beautiful house.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.520
It's been in Haåkon's
family for a long time.

37:47.570 --> 37:49.600
Built in 1778.

37:49.670 --> 37:52.130
You have some champagne?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.030
Uh, yes.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.970
I'll see if I can find Linda for you.

38:59.130 --> 39:00.400
Kurt?

39:01.400 --> 39:03.280
You fancy a drink?

39:03.330 --> 39:05.730
Away from all this nonsense?

39:13.830 --> 39:16.250
Do you see much of your ex-wife?

39:16.300 --> 39:17.730
Inga?

39:17.780 --> 39:18.750
Well...

39:18.800 --> 39:21.630
She and Louise seem to get along.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.180
I like her.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.020
She seems very nice.

39:25.070 --> 39:27.930
Pity she couldn't be here.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.270
Yeah.

39:31.830 --> 39:34.680
Odd, that one should be so
much a part of somebody's life,

39:34.730 --> 39:35.720
and then...

39:35.770 --> 39:37.080
Yeah, I don't see her very often.

39:37.130 --> 39:39.280
I mean, we're perfectly fine
these days, but I just...

39:39.330 --> 39:41.530
Oh, I don't mean to pry.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.020
Klara's a wonderful little girl.

39:47.070 --> 39:48.700
Yes, she is.

39:48.770 --> 39:50.820
Very bright, very light.

39:50.870 --> 39:52.170
Very.

39:52.230 --> 39:55.300
I hope she manages to hold
on to the lightheartedness.

39:55.370 --> 39:59.470
Most children seem to
lose it sooner or later.

39:59.530 --> 40:04.930
It's a rare thing, to be able to be happy.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.870
It's different nowadays.

40:07.930 --> 40:09.350
Happiness is something

40:09.400 --> 40:10.920
that people seem to think is their right.

40:10.970 --> 40:14.330
They don't worry about starvation

40:14.400 --> 40:16.050
or having a roof over their head

40:16.100 --> 40:18.130
or being invaded,

40:18.200 --> 40:22.100
so they worry about whether
they're happy or not.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.170
I suppose that's some kind of progress.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.670
Haåkon?

40:37.730 --> 40:39.670
What is it?

40:39.730 --> 40:41.000
Uh...

40:47.570 --> 40:50.830
The autumn of 1980.

40:50.900 --> 40:53.430
What were you doing then?

40:53.480 --> 40:54.050
Police officer.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.720
Just started.

40:55.770 --> 40:58.130
35 years.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.230
On the first of October,
we had an alarm call.

41:01.300 --> 41:05.100
A Russian submarine was in
the Haårsfjaärden channel.

41:05.170 --> 41:08.570
Foreign submarines in a restricted area.

41:08.630 --> 41:09.920
You remember all the fuss?

41:09.970 --> 41:11.150
I do.

41:11.200 --> 41:15.070
Don't know what you could
compare it with, really.

41:15.130 --> 41:17.670
Maybe a Soviet helicopter

41:17.730 --> 41:19.620
landing outside the Royal Palace.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.650
That's what it felt like.

41:21.700 --> 41:23.520
We never got it, though.

41:23.570 --> 41:26.530
They didn't let us.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.920
They made us leave the
submarines where they were

41:28.970 --> 41:34.100
because they didn't want
an international incident.

41:34.170 --> 41:37.470
I think it was the greatest
betrayal in Swedish history.

41:42.330 --> 41:45.800
I must go back to my party.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.670
I'm being rude.

42:19.130 --> 42:20.380
Let me help.

42:20.430 --> 42:21.520
Leave it, leave it.

42:21.570 --> 42:23.040
Leave it!

42:30.000 --> 42:31.150
I thought you'd gone to bed.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.050
Oh, uh, about to.

42:33.100 --> 42:35.680
Sorry, I'm in the middle of a...

42:35.730 --> 42:38.470
There's a young girl gone missing.

42:41.630 --> 42:43.900
Thank you for coming.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.150
Linda, come and talk to some
of these people, will you?

42:47.200 --> 42:48.750
I've got nothing to say to them.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.620
Okay.

42:49.670 --> 42:50.950
Night, Dad.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.940
Night, sweetheart.

43:13.230 --> 43:14.280
Yeah?

43:14.330 --> 43:16.330
Kurt, it's Lennart.

43:35.800 --> 43:36.820
I...

43:36.870 --> 43:38.920
I have to rush back down to work.

43:38.970 --> 43:39.920
It's an emergency.

43:39.970 --> 43:40.950
Sorry.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.330
I understand.

43:43.400 --> 43:46.180
Oh, I must thank you for the painting.

43:46.230 --> 43:47.680
Oh, it's nothing.

43:47.730 --> 43:48.980
One of your father's?

43:49.030 --> 43:50.050
One of many.

43:50.100 --> 43:51.080
Of the same thing.

43:51.130 --> 43:53.750
My dad always painted the same thing.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.540
We all have our furrows to plough.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.650
I go for the same walk every day.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.900
Drink the same coffee,
think the same thoughts.

44:04.970 --> 44:06.380
You come to an age like mine,

44:06.430 --> 44:08.120
you start to realize it's impossible

44:08.170 --> 44:12.370
to be anybody other than
you have always been.

44:12.430 --> 44:14.300
Thank you, Kurt.

44:14.350 --> 44:15.220
See you soon.

44:15.270 --> 44:16.670
Hope so.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.240
Sorry.

45:10.300 --> 45:11.720
You're keeping my boy.

45:11.770 --> 45:12.950
Why are you keeping my boy?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.120
We can discuss this when I've taken...

45:14.170 --> 45:14.980
I have a temper.

45:15.030 --> 45:16.220
You've seen I have a temper.

45:16.270 --> 45:18.250
Don't threaten me, I'm doing my job.

45:18.300 --> 45:19.920
A woman's been murdered,
a girl's gone missing.

45:19.970 --> 45:21.350
I'm not threatening you.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.620
I'm telling you that

45:22.670 --> 45:24.850
if you try and pin any of this on him,

45:24.900 --> 45:26.620
I'll hunt you down and I'll kill you.

45:26.670 --> 45:27.920
The boy did nothing.

45:27.970 --> 45:30.720
Now, you mess with my
blood, I'll mess with yours,

45:30.770 --> 45:32.640
policeman or not.

45:37.830 --> 45:39.830
You should go home.

45:55.270 --> 45:56.870
So?

45:56.930 --> 45:59.170
He's not talking.

45:59.230 --> 46:01.920
The knife you found is the murder weapon.

46:01.970 --> 46:03.320
His prints are on it,

46:03.370 --> 46:06.080
and they were in the Hjelmqvist place.

46:06.130 --> 46:08.530
He was there clearing it up.

46:15.570 --> 46:21.630
What were you doing at Erika
and Hannah Hjelmqvist's house?

46:21.700 --> 46:23.050
Were you there at any point

46:23.100 --> 46:27.030
between the 10th and the 16th of October?

46:29.100 --> 46:32.900
Do you want something to eat?

46:32.970 --> 46:36.620
You can answer that without
incriminating yourself.

46:36.670 --> 46:38.470
- Yeah.
- Okay.

46:52.100 --> 46:53.880
So, why would you kill two people?

46:53.930 --> 46:56.470
For your father?

46:56.530 --> 46:57.620
For that farm?

46:57.670 --> 47:01.500
That was, what, your
tenth house in six years?

47:01.570 --> 47:03.930
Two people dead?

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
Hey Pontus, do you want to
tell me what really went on?

47:09.430 --> 47:13.430
Because we just want to know
what's happened to Hannah.

47:14.330 --> 47:15.600
Fine.

47:17.470 --> 47:19.550
So, later on today, Pontus,

47:19.600 --> 47:21.950
we're going to charge you formally

47:22.000 --> 47:24.870
with the murder of Erika Hjelmqvist.

47:27.200 --> 47:31.200
And we're going to continue
to interview you tomorrow.

47:41.130 --> 47:42.350
Kurt.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.450
Yep?

47:43.500 --> 47:47.230
I was thinking, as far as Hannah goes,

47:47.300 --> 47:49.120
maybe she was spooked.

47:49.170 --> 47:51.100
Sorry?

47:51.170 --> 47:53.280
Her mother ran away, she ran off.

47:53.330 --> 47:56.970
She didn't die where she was attacked.

47:57.030 --> 47:58.580
I can't think of many mothers

47:58.630 --> 48:01.250
who would leave their daughter behind.

48:01.300 --> 48:03.900
Maybe they both got out.

48:03.970 --> 48:06.120
Maybe she's still alive.

48:06.170 --> 48:09.370
If she escaped but she was injured,

48:09.430 --> 48:10.480
where might she go?

48:10.530 --> 48:13.350
Where do you think we
haven't concentrated?

48:13.400 --> 48:15.340
The foster family.

48:17.900 --> 48:19.650
Yeah, you're right.

48:19.700 --> 48:22.440
That's exactly where we should go.

48:23.570 --> 48:25.750
Oh, there's someone in
reception to see you.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.870
Okay, let's go, then.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.830
Baiba?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.420
How are you?

48:43.470 --> 48:45.970
Are you...?

48:46.030 --> 48:47.980
What the hell are you doing here?

48:48.030 --> 48:49.180
I'm fine.

48:49.230 --> 48:50.650
Are you fine?

48:50.700 --> 48:52.350
I'm... I'm fine.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.770
I...

48:55.220 --> 48:56.220
What are you...

48:56.270 --> 48:57.750
What are you doing here?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.980
I have a concert in Copenhagen.

48:59.030 --> 49:00.320
Right.

49:00.370 --> 49:03.230
I saw a train to Ystad,

49:03.300 --> 49:07.000
and I thought it would be a surprise.

49:07.070 --> 49:08.800
It is, yeah.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.830
How is Linda, and Klara?

49:13.900 --> 49:16.550
Klara, uh, great, they're both fine.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.700
How are you?

49:20.200 --> 49:22.130
I'm happier.

49:22.200 --> 49:27.000
It's nice to be traveling
and playing again.

49:27.070 --> 49:29.220
And how long are you staying?

49:29.270 --> 49:30.520
A few days.

49:30.570 --> 49:31.840
So...

49:31.900 --> 49:32.950
Kurt, you, uh...?

49:33.000 --> 49:33.980
Yeah, I'm just...

49:34.030 --> 49:35.080
Well, go.

49:35.130 --> 49:36.930
Will you stay?

49:37.000 --> 49:41.430
Because I... I don't want you to leave.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.950
Take my keys,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.740
get a taxi, make yourself at home.

49:46.870 --> 49:48.050
Well, we don't have to.

49:48.100 --> 49:48.580
We could have a drink
here later at the hotel.

49:48.630 --> 49:49.150
I would like to.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.320
Yeah?

49:50.370 --> 49:51.670
Yes.

49:52.730 --> 49:54.970
Hey, have you got a...?

49:55.030 --> 49:57.400
Thank you.

49:57.470 --> 50:02.830
Now, there is a slightly smelly black dog.

50:02.880 --> 50:03.580
Jussi.

50:03.630 --> 50:04.250
Jussi, well remembered.

50:04.300 --> 50:06.300
He's very friendly.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.050
I will try not to get lost on my way.

50:11.100 --> 50:13.240
It's great to see you.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.230
I had no idea.

50:20.300 --> 50:23.230
I hadn't heard a thing.

50:23.300 --> 50:26.520
There will have been a
conspiracy to keep it from me.

50:26.570 --> 50:29.530
They won't have wanted me to worry,

50:29.600 --> 50:33.970
but that's just stupid of them.

50:34.030 --> 50:36.220
I mean, I fostered her for years!

50:36.270 --> 50:37.450
Oh, Christ, poor thing.

50:37.500 --> 50:39.880
We don't know that she's
necessarily come to any harm.

50:39.930 --> 50:41.780
Well, she hasn't come
to any good, has she?

50:41.830 --> 50:44.050
Well, if she was afraid, or...

50:44.100 --> 50:45.680
Has she been in touch with you recently?

50:45.730 --> 50:46.820
No.

50:46.870 --> 50:48.780
At all, since she was fostered?

50:48.830 --> 50:49.970
No.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.770
This is her.

51:11.830 --> 51:14.680
She couldn't sleep with the light off.

51:14.730 --> 51:16.320
Little puppet she called Mouse

51:16.370 --> 51:18.020
she wouldn't let go of.

51:18.070 --> 51:20.920
She called it Mouse, but it was a dog.

51:20.970 --> 51:26.000
You try to turn them around,
give them some love, stability,

51:26.070 --> 51:27.280
and you hope they turn out well.

51:27.330 --> 51:29.820
Well, she went back to her parents.

51:29.870 --> 51:31.650
Yes, they were still together.

51:31.700 --> 51:33.450
I mean, that's unusual.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.970
She was very sad to go.

51:36.030 --> 51:38.580
And you haven't heard from her since?

51:38.630 --> 51:40.470
No.

51:40.530 --> 51:41.880
We write.

51:41.930 --> 51:44.970
Photographs at Christmas,
little birthday things.

51:45.030 --> 51:46.620
Some of them write back.

51:46.670 --> 51:48.670
Some of them visit.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.100
I sent her a note

51:51.170 --> 51:54.570
when Rasmus died last year -- my husband.

51:54.630 --> 51:55.750
Did she reply?

51:55.800 --> 51:57.670
No.

51:57.730 --> 52:01.930
Well, I suppose it's better
if they don't, to be honest.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.680
If we've done it well,

52:03.730 --> 52:06.470
they should be happy to forget us.

52:07.130 --> 52:08.250
Hi, Maja.

52:08.300 --> 52:09.450
Hello, darlings.

52:09.500 --> 52:10.920
Hi, Maja.

52:10.970 --> 52:12.770
Hi!

52:12.830 --> 52:14.050
Well, I better get these ones fed,

52:14.100 --> 52:15.720
if you don't mind.

52:15.770 --> 52:19.170
We'll be in touch as
soon as we know anything.

52:20.700 --> 52:23.100
Now then, what will we have?

52:41.930 --> 52:44.100
No, he's really fit.

52:44.170 --> 52:46.620
I mean, I even took him
to my yoga class once.

52:46.670 --> 52:47.620
Yoga?

52:47.670 --> 52:48.920
Yeah.

52:48.970 --> 52:51.440
I mean, that was a mistake...

52:51.530 --> 52:53.420
Uh, hello everybody!

52:53.470 --> 52:54.620
Hello!

52:54.670 --> 52:56.020
Hello, Granddad!

52:56.070 --> 52:57.120
Hello, you!

52:57.170 --> 52:58.850
Good to see you!

52:58.900 --> 53:00.550
You have lots of guests.

53:00.600 --> 53:01.820
And Linda is coming to my concert.

53:01.870 --> 53:02.680
Really?

53:02.730 --> 53:03.820
Well, the more, the merrier.

53:03.870 --> 53:05.180
Are you gonna stay for din dins tonight?

53:05.230 --> 53:06.650
No, we're long overdue.

53:06.700 --> 53:07.780
Okay.

53:07.830 --> 53:09.150
I've got to get this one to bed.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.740
Come here.

53:12.770 --> 53:15.270
No, we were, um...

53:15.330 --> 53:18.970
We were really just
checking if you were okay,

53:19.030 --> 53:21.430
which clearly you are,

53:21.500 --> 53:23.520
so we're just going to say good night.

53:23.570 --> 53:24.320
All right.

53:24.370 --> 53:25.920
Say bye to Granddad.

53:25.970 --> 53:26.550
Bye, Granddad.

53:26.600 --> 53:27.080
Say bye to Baiba.

53:27.130 --> 53:28.220
Bye, Baiba!

53:28.270 --> 53:29.350
Ata!

53:29.400 --> 53:30.720
Have a nice evening.

53:30.770 --> 53:32.180
See you soon.

53:32.230 --> 53:33.180
Take it easy.

53:33.230 --> 53:35.970
Sleep well and drive safe, please.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.400
You don't have a piano?

54:05.130 --> 54:06.770
No.

54:06.830 --> 54:09.020
Every house should have a piano.

54:09.070 --> 54:10.920
A lady might come one time

54:10.970 --> 54:14.370
and want to play the piano for you.

54:14.430 --> 54:16.500
Well, I will get one.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.570
Can I help you?

56:18.730 --> 56:20.400
What is it?

56:26.670 --> 56:28.820
Look, I used to go over
there every now and again

56:28.870 --> 56:30.810
after Anders died.

56:32.070 --> 56:34.780
Help with the heavy stuff --
odd jobs, you know, fixing.

56:34.830 --> 56:36.230
Right.

56:36.300 --> 56:39.200
I screwed her a couple of times.

56:39.270 --> 56:41.340
My wife doesn't know.

56:43.630 --> 56:45.570
I mean, she was...

56:46.200 --> 56:48.270
Erika was a bit wild.

56:51.370 --> 56:54.870
I feel I took advantage, really.

56:54.930 --> 56:58.170
She wasn't 100% in control.

56:58.230 --> 56:59.820
So how do you mean?

56:59.870 --> 57:01.350
Things weren't right
between her and the girl.

57:01.400 --> 57:02.580
They hadn't been right for a long time,

57:02.630 --> 57:05.500
not since she moved back in with them.

57:05.550 --> 57:06.220
She didn't love her mom.

57:06.270 --> 57:08.630
How can you know that?

57:08.680 --> 57:09.250
Erika said so.

57:09.300 --> 57:11.150
It's what she felt.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.180
Her daughter hated her.

57:13.230 --> 57:15.030
So they argued?

57:15.100 --> 57:18.770
They argued like hell after he died.

57:18.830 --> 57:20.980
She had a boyfriend, Hannah.

57:21.030 --> 57:22.120
Whoever it was, she wouldn't say,

57:22.170 --> 57:24.550
but she was hardly there some weeks,

57:24.600 --> 57:25.650
stayed out all night.

57:25.700 --> 57:27.620
And you have no idea
who the boyfriend was?

57:27.670 --> 57:29.330
No.

57:31.500 --> 57:32.840
Thanks.

57:42.430 --> 57:44.350
Was your son having a relationship

57:44.400 --> 57:45.120
with Hannah Hjelmqvist?

57:45.170 --> 57:47.440
Are you out of your mind?

57:53.630 --> 57:56.330
Had he shown any interest in her?

57:56.400 --> 57:58.980
You know what that bitch of
a mother was like with us?

57:59.030 --> 58:00.850
I'd have killed her myself.

58:00.900 --> 58:02.930
You've charged him?

58:02.980 --> 58:03.480
That's what I heard.

58:03.530 --> 58:04.020
With murder.

58:04.070 --> 58:04.880
We're going to.

58:04.930 --> 58:05.920
We have no choice

58:05.970 --> 58:06.920
unless you do something to help your son.

58:06.970 --> 58:08.020
You think he could be so dumb?

58:08.070 --> 58:09.080
Killing people,

58:09.130 --> 58:10.550
leaving a knife in a rubbish bag?

58:10.600 --> 58:12.800
Somebody was that dumb.

58:13.130 --> 58:14.780
I haven't got anything left.

58:14.830 --> 58:17.230
I haven't got anything left!

58:20.500 --> 58:24.530
Did you hear what I said?

58:26.070 --> 58:27.470
Get out!

58:33.630 --> 58:37.230
Just... think about it.

58:37.400 --> 58:39.180
Think about it, she was
an attractive girl.

58:39.230 --> 58:41.500
You think about your son.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.570
Sorry.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.440
Bravo!

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.440
Bravo!

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:18.800
[Let's have a drink.]

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:35.980
Is he all right?

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:37.520
Jussi, are you all right?

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:38.880
Good boy.

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.520
You had an alarm.

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.370
In the kitchen.

01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:57.630
You forgot to turn the gas off.

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:00.130
No, I didn't forget.

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.380
Kurt, it's not so bad.

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:03.780
We can clean this up.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.850
No, I didn't forget, I didn't forget.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.830
What I want...

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.550
I just want some...

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.480
I'm not...

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:11.480
I need to...

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:12.650
People are trying to scare me,

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.370
that's what they're trying to do.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.570
Kurt?

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:02.270
Gustav?!

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:11.720
What the hell do you think you're doing?

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:12.380
Kurt...

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:13.320
What are you doing here?

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:14.420
Kurt.

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:15.980
You know how much you'll serve? Arson?

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.020
25 years.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.100
Kurt!

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:20.750
It's Hannah's.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.750
It's her childhood toy and letters.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.600
Where was that?

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:27.270
My son's things.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.170
Stupid lad.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.680
There it is, then.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:35.400
He knew her, one way or another.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:37.350
It's yours.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.780
You do what you like with it.

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.770
Let me know, yeah?

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.500
What are you saying about arson?

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:46.980
What are you shouting about?

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.720
It's nothing, I...

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:50.310
Thank you.

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:52.430
Let me know.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.950
Why would he have these?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.300
These foster things.

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.520
None of them are addressed to her.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:05.480
What?

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:06.880
These letters from the foster mother.

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:09.870
They're to "Dear Stefan."

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:12.930
Stefan was the name of her foster brother.

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:15.750
What, have we heard of him somewhere?

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.270
No.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920
Ah!

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:22.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.850
He was here the other day,
he was asking about her.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.780
That's him!

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:25.680
Come on, come on.

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:27.000
Kurt?

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.880
Excuse me, yeah, Stefan Persson, please?

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:38.630
Yeah, sure.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.430
Stefan?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.900
Police are in my office,
they want to see you.

01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:46.950
Stefan!

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.180
Have you seen Hannah recently?

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:50.780
Have you seen Hannah recently?

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.620
We know she had your letters.

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:53.750
Why?

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.950
Why didn't you tell us?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.020
Why didn't you tell us you had seen her?

01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.180
I wasn't sure it...

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:59.300
When did you see her?

01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:01.650
I didn't recognize her, okay?

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.120
I hadn't set eyes on her in seven years,

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.150
then there was just this girl there,

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.220
suddenly giving me this almighty hug.

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:11.500
She looked thin, and we sat and talked

01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:12.920
about the old days, when we were kids.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.050
What was she doing when you saw her?

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.250
The train.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.880
Catching a train to Tomellila
to see her boyfriend.

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:19.600
Why does she have your letters?

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:21.450
She asked me why Maja and Rasmus,

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.520
our foster parents, had
never written to her.

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.570
She was really desperate about that.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.480
I told her they must have done.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:28.320
They always did, to all of us.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.800
It was a point of principle.

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:32.020
She came home with me.

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:34.320
I gave her my old letters
and things to read.

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:36.220
How did she react?

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:37.720
She was upset.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:39.850
Her mom must have been
keeping them from her.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.000
Her mom would never allow
her to get in contact

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:46.730
because she'd been desperate
to go back to Maja and Rasmus.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:47.780
There was never much love lost

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.450
between her and her birth mother.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.870
And she was heartbroken

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:54.380
when she read the letter about Rasmus --

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.430
that he was dead.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.720
I put her on the train

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:00.780
and she was still sobbing her heart out.

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:02.970
Did you see her again?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.450
Did you see her again?

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.670
I said we'd meet up.

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.970
Then this happened.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:12.750
I didn't know if she...

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.180
I mean, I knew she had a temper,

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.680
but I wouldn't think for one second

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:16.620
that she was capable of anything...

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:19.010
It's all right, thank you.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.070
All right, Pontus.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.030
So, we don't have much
time, I don't think, so...

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.750
We know that you know Hannah.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.350
We know that you care about her a lot.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.420
We know that you're her friend.

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.750
So did she come to you for help?

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.820
Did you try and help her?

01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:43.020
Did you keep her things safe?

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:44.150
Did you take care of her?

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.120
Did you clean up after her?

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:48.110
Did you clean everything up after her?

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.350
Just tell us, Pontus, what
kind of state was she in?

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.830
She was terrified, I assume,
absolutely terrified.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.250
She'd fought with her mom.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.380
She'd hurt her mom,
she'd really hurt her mom

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:00.520
because her mom had lied
to her all these years,

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.220
and you tried to help her

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:06.270
because you care about her,
because she was in a mess.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.480
You must be terrified for her.

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:13.180
So where is she, Pontus?

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:15.650
Tell us where she is
and we can get her safe.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.370
We can make sure that she's okay.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:23.520
Hannah pitched up at mine last week.

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:25.720
She'd fought with her mom.

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:28.569
Her mom was drunk.

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.950
We went back, but she wasn't there.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:31.920
We didn't know what had happened.

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.970
So where is she now?

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:36.700
I can't.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:38.420
You tell me where she is now

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.350
or I will make sure that
you never see her again.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.340
Do you understand?

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.370
Tomellila.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.100
A caravan by some greenhouses.

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.420
I was bringing her food.

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:00.140
I don't know where she'll be now.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.800
She'll be worried to death.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.950
Right, let's step up the alert for Hannah.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.220
Search the area.

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:25.800
See if we can get roadblocks
on the E65 and the 101.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.750
And give Maja Hahne and
Stefan Persson a call.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.279
She might be in touch with them
if she has nowhere else to go.

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:32.979
Yeah, Wallander.

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:34.520
Hi Kurt, it's Dr. OÖberg here.

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:35.550
Yeah.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.880
I was wondering if you could come in.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:38.120
Why?

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:40.550
I'd like to discuss your
blood tests with you.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.750
I'm just... I'm busy right now.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.779
Sure.

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:46.479
So I'll have to give you a call, yeah?

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:46.880
Okay, Kurt.

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:48.270
Thanks.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.750
Where are you heading?

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.500
Ystad.

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:30.570
Yeah, okay, jump in.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.030
You can, um...

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.470
I know I said Ystad,
but you can actually...

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:18.150
You can drop me off here at the corner.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.600
It's fine, it's no trouble.

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:27.210
Hannah?

01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:32.010
Hannah!

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.740
Hannah!

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.510
Hannah!

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.320
Hannah!

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:58.710
Hannah!

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.230
Hannah!

01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.870
Wait, wait, wait.

01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:11.570
Be careful.

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:12.920
Hannah, Hannah!

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:14.310
Hannah!

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.870
What's wrong with you?

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.550
What's wrong with you?!

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.450
Hannah, my name's Kurt,
I'm a police officer.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.350
No!

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.280
We know you were angry.

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:25.580
We know you were hurt.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:29.830
It's all right, we know you
didn't mean for it to happen.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.240
I'm sorry.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.180
She...

01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:43.350
I didn't...

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.600
It's all right.

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:48.470
I'm so sorry.

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:50.730
It's all right, come on.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.000
Come on.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.620
Where's Pontus?

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.220
He's safe, he's fine.

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.070
It's all right.

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:04.170
It's all right.

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:21.250
I was only trying to protect myself.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.520
I wasn't actually going to kill anybody.

01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:25.030
But she didn't believe me...

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.850
Yeah?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.450
Kurt, I need you back at the station

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.750
as soon as you can.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.340
All right.

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.970
What's the problem?

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:38.300
Is this yours?

01:16:38.370 --> 01:16:39.910
I don't...

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:52.870
You left it on a chair at a
restaurant next to the E65.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.800
I...

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:00.880
A little girl picked it up.

01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:02.480
Her dad took it from her.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:04.050
It was fully loaded.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.640
I'm sorry.

01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:13.280
Were you drunk?

01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:15.630
No.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.380
No...

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.380
I'm sorry, Kurt,

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:19.620
I'm going to have to suspend you

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:22.670
pending an internal affairs investigation.

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:27.810
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.230
So...

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.280
Well, Sweden was very beautiful.

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:08.300
Yeah.

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:10.450
But you will be coming to Riga soon, yes?

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.520
As soon as I can get some time off.

01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:14.440
I'll try not to get lost on the way.

01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:16.730
Bye.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.600
(I love you.)
