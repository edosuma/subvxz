00:04.379 --> 00:05.880
the last thing my boyfriend did

00:05.922 --> 00:07.590
before he left
for college was dump me.

After that, the punches flew

00:12.929 --> 00:15.682

they were moving in together.

00:15.724 --> 00:16.725

decided at the last minute

that she didn't wanna
make it official..

00:27.777 --> 00:31.197

00:31.239 --> 00:32.574
...George was left
in the lurch

00:32.615 --> 00:33.950

And now that
she was in Chatswin

01:10.111 --> 01:13.573
I didn't even mind living here.

on this dog.

They were gonna put him down.

When it comes
to being left in the dust

20:26.016 --> 20:27.643
I'm kind of a pro.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.811
Boyfriends, moms.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.522
I'd been left behind
by the best of them.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.149
I knew better than
to listen to sad songs

20:34.191 --> 20:36.068
or to check my phone
every two seconds

20:36.109 --> 20:37.861
to see if they had called

20:37.903 --> 20:39.863
because they didn't.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.117
But if your light
is on at 2 a.m.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.120
and even one person
checks to see if you're okay..

20:48.247 --> 20:49.206
...you're okay.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.958
I'm awake, dad!

20:51.833 --> 20:53.085
Come in.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.589
Of course, who it is
that comes to check

20:57.631 --> 20:59.925
might just surprise you.
