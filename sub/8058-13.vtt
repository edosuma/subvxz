WEBVTT

00:01.162 --> 00:02.838
What do you mean, you can't?
Look...

00:03.112 --> 00:05.592
I am throwing a farewell party
for my best friend, Ann Perkins.

00:05.608 --> 00:07.688
And if she casually mentioned 3 years ago

00:07.808 --> 00:10.050
that she thought indoor
fireworks would be cool

00:10.170 --> 00:12.158
then guess what,
you're gonna give me indoor fireworks.

00:12.278 --> 00:15.364
Tonight's biggest surprise
is 5 years in the making.

00:15.484 --> 00:17.864
It all goes back to when I
first met my best friend.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.047
I'm here to talk about

00:19.167 --> 00:20.651
the abandoned lot
on Sullivan Street.

00:20.702 --> 00:23.587
I've been trying to get this
thing fixed for months,

00:23.621 --> 00:25.288
and it's government-owned

00:25.323 --> 00:26.573
and you need
to do something about it.

00:26.607 --> 00:28.291
- I will help you.
- Is that a promise?

00:28.326 --> 00:29.909
It's more than a promise.

00:29.927 --> 00:31.728
It's a pinky promise.

00:31.779 --> 00:34.197
That promise launched
a friendship so grand

00:34.232 --> 00:36.600
it takes 103 scrapbooks
to capture it.

00:36.634 --> 00:39.352
I have secretly arranged
to officially break ground

00:39.370 --> 00:41.154
on Pawnee commons at midnight,

00:41.172 --> 00:44.825
fulfilling my pinky promise
that I made five years ago.

00:44.859 --> 00:48.178
Oh, ice cream sandwich
taste test!

00:48.229 --> 00:49.946
That was our biggest fight.

00:49.981 --> 00:51.598
- Hey, Knope.
- Harold.

00:51.632 --> 00:53.834
You're breaking ground on
the Pawnee commons tonight?

00:53.868 --> 00:55.936
Public works
never signed off on that.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.571
Look, your office
was giving me a hard time,

00:57.605 --> 00:59.456
so I had to call in
a few favors.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.625
I don't like it
when people go over my head.

01:01.676 --> 01:03.209
Understood.
I will make a note of that.

01:03.227 --> 01:04.177
Would you like a treat?

01:04.212 --> 01:05.912
I run that department

01:05.947 --> 01:09.349
and I do not appreciate--

01:09.384 --> 01:10.851
- Damn, that's really good.
- Right?

01:10.885 --> 01:12.069
There's gonna be a lot
of these at the party.

01:12.103 --> 01:13.170
- You should come by.
- I kno--

01:13.204 --> 01:14.621
I get it.
I know what you're doing.

01:14.655 --> 01:16.807
And I still--is there
a little crunch in there?

01:16.841 --> 01:17.941
- Hazelnut.
- Ooh.

01:17.975 --> 01:18.942
Ooh, right?

01:18.976 --> 01:20.160
See you tonight.

01:20.194 --> 01:22.262
Okay, well,
let's go set up this party.

01:22.296 --> 01:23.513
April, thank you.

01:23.548 --> 01:26.266
I know you may tease Ann,
but deep down inside

01:26.300 --> 01:27.701
I can tell that you really care.

01:27.735 --> 01:32.806
Ann's leaving town and saying
painful good-byes to loved ones.

01:32.824 --> 01:36.276
Greatest day of my life!

01:39.230 --> 01:49.135
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:57.698 --> 02:00.217
Thank you all so much for
helping me with these boxes.

02:00.268 --> 02:03.103
I'm just a little behind because
every time I start, I get--

02:03.137 --> 02:05.705
a little emotional.

02:05.739 --> 02:07.441
Hey, that box
has my name on it.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.991
Hey, this one
has my name on it.

02:09.026 --> 02:11.244
This one
has plates' name on it.

02:11.278 --> 02:13.463
You have just found
your buddy boxes.

02:13.514 --> 02:16.316
Each box contains a memento
of our friendship.

02:16.350 --> 02:17.617
I was gonna give them
to you later,

02:17.651 --> 02:21.287
but there is no time
like the present.

02:21.305 --> 02:23.356
Fun pun alert.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.375
A bronzed hamburger.

02:25.409 --> 02:27.677
It's from our turkey versus
beef cook-off, remember?

02:27.712 --> 02:29.112
You were a worthy adversary.

02:29.147 --> 02:31.848
I would have preferred
a regular hamburger for eating,

02:31.883 --> 02:33.750
but this is very nice.

02:33.801 --> 02:36.353
2008 Indiana state audit
spreadsheets?

02:36.387 --> 02:39.739
Man, that year was insane!

02:39.773 --> 02:41.653
That was the year you went
from being an auditor

02:41.676 --> 02:42.642
to a legend.

02:42.677 --> 02:44.311
Whoa!

02:44.345 --> 02:46.713
A picture of me officiating
Leslie and Ben's wedding.

02:46.747 --> 02:49.249
And look, you can
just about see my head.

02:49.267 --> 02:50.550
Thank you so much.

02:50.568 --> 02:52.319
Snakejuice!

02:52.353 --> 02:54.037
I thought these were destroyed
by the FDA.

02:54.071 --> 02:56.289
I did have to go to a very
seedy location to find it,

02:56.307 --> 02:59.493
but now I know where to go to
place a bet on horse fighting.

03:01.846 --> 03:04.598
Okay, don't mention anything
about the groundbreaking to Ann.

03:04.632 --> 03:05.782
Repeat that back to me.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.083
Tell Ann about
the groundbreaking,

03:07.118 --> 03:08.285
frame Ann for murder,

03:08.336 --> 03:09.836
release a deadly virus
into the water supply.

03:09.854 --> 03:11.054
Good.
Oh!

03:11.105 --> 03:13.824
Bon voyage, Ann.

03:13.858 --> 03:15.458
My God, this is amazing.

03:15.510 --> 03:16.626
That's sparkling cider.

03:16.677 --> 03:18.518
Why is there a New Year's Eve
countdown clock

03:18.546 --> 03:19.696
and the Easter bunny?

03:19.730 --> 03:20.814
I don't know
when we're gonna be able

03:20.848 --> 03:22.649
to visit each other,
so just to be safe

03:22.667 --> 03:25.185
this party is a celebration
of every event

03:25.219 --> 03:26.686
that's gonna happen this year.

03:26.721 --> 03:29.756
Your birthday, New Year's,
Chinese New Year's, flag day.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.591
Ain't no party like
a Leslie Knope party

03:31.609 --> 03:34.110
'cause a Leslie Knope party
is actually 30 parties.

03:34.145 --> 03:36.163
Knope, you have
out-knoped yourself.

03:37.381 --> 03:38.882
Seems like the party's
dying down. Weird.

03:38.916 --> 03:41.301
Ann, you probably wanna head
to Michigan forever,

03:41.319 --> 03:44.004
so I snuck into your house
and packed a bag for you. Bye.

03:44.038 --> 03:46.389
This is just a bunch
of bras and knives.

03:46.424 --> 03:48.141
And loose onions.

03:48.175 --> 03:49.359
Okay, party!

03:49.410 --> 03:50.810
Don't drink!
Have fun!

03:50.828 --> 03:54.764
Hey, so we have a little
farewell gift for you.

03:54.799 --> 03:57.284
We all pitched in
and got you a gift card

03:57.318 --> 03:59.886
from that home store,
"Pots and Pans."

03:59.921 --> 04:02.439
We have been on the prowl
for some amazing pots.

04:02.473 --> 04:05.325
Well, that card's
for three pans.

04:05.359 --> 04:07.660
Either way, this is great.

04:07.678 --> 04:09.012
You know what?

04:09.046 --> 04:10.446
We should get
to the good-bye party,

04:10.448 --> 04:11.764
although I know
it's mostly for Ann.

04:11.782 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, but there's, like,
one corner for you

04:14.035 --> 04:15.685
and it's just carob cookies
and berries.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.220
Carob cookies and berries

04:17.271 --> 04:19.772
are literally my favorite
dessert alternative.

04:19.790 --> 04:22.292
I'll go get changed.

04:22.343 --> 04:24.928
Man, he put a lot of work
into our presents.

04:24.962 --> 04:27.063
I feel kinda bad just
getting him a gift card.

04:27.098 --> 04:29.282
I also shook his hand.
Twice.

04:29.317 --> 04:31.051
Anything more than that
would be excessive.

04:31.085 --> 04:32.986
Let's all put our heads
together and brainstorm.

04:33.004 --> 04:34.738
We gotta send this dude off
with the perfect gift.

04:34.772 --> 04:36.656
I say we start
with the three "Câ€™s,"

04:36.707 --> 04:39.025
cashmere, concert tickets,
caboodles of cash.

04:39.043 --> 04:41.394
I feel like those
are perfect gifts for you.

04:41.445 --> 04:42.996
Those are perfect gifts
for anyone.

04:43.030 --> 04:46.582
Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!

04:46.601 --> 04:49.402
I'm 100% sure
that I will not meet

04:49.453 --> 04:51.187
another Donna Meagle
in Michigan.

04:51.205 --> 04:52.522
I'm gonna miss you.

04:52.540 --> 04:54.124
You know, I'm gonna miss you
too, Perkins.

04:54.158 --> 04:55.892
But now that you're officially
out of the dating pool,

04:55.927 --> 04:58.028
you know I'm gonna
run this town, right?

04:58.062 --> 04:59.446
Ooh.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.549
Oh, yeah, you do not wanna
go down that road.

05:02.583 --> 05:03.600
Trust me, I tried.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.151
Hi, Stephen.

05:05.186 --> 05:06.152
Hey, Ann.

05:06.203 --> 05:09.422
- Super cute baby bump.
- Thanks.

05:09.457 --> 05:11.541
Good looking out.

05:11.559 --> 05:14.361
Hey, Ron, have you seen April?

05:14.395 --> 05:16.479
I've been mostly focused
on these ribs.

05:16.497 --> 05:20.216
By the way, you're out of Easter
ham and Thanksgiving turkey.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.351
Great party.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.170
Hey.

05:24.205 --> 05:25.155
Are you on the lot?

05:25.189 --> 05:26.156
Is everything okay?

05:26.190 --> 05:27.607
Uh, not really.

05:27.642 --> 05:30.159
Public works put up a giant
padlock on the fence

05:30.177 --> 05:32.979
and a sign that says
"No trespassing."

05:33.014 --> 05:34.430
That probably
doesn't apply to us.

05:34.448 --> 05:37.183
There's also a sign that says
"Especially Leslie Knope."

05:37.218 --> 05:39.336
Well, Leslie Knope
is a very common name.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.638
There's a professor in
Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.

05:41.672 --> 05:43.423
They probably mean him.

05:43.474 --> 05:44.555
Do they mean the professor?

05:44.558 --> 05:47.560
Yeah,
there's a picture of you also.

05:47.595 --> 05:50.063
And two huge security guards.

05:50.097 --> 05:51.881
Holy mother of Malia!

05:51.899 --> 05:53.183
And Sasha.

05:53.217 --> 05:54.601
I love them both equally.

05:54.652 --> 05:56.319
Okay, it's that stupid Harold
who's behind this.

05:56.354 --> 05:59.906
Get here and we will
make a plan.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.891
How long do I have to do this?

06:01.909 --> 06:03.526
Until I say so, Orin!

06:03.560 --> 06:05.640
Stay in character.

06:10.356 --> 06:12.626
Leslie can't watch anything
with Julie Andrews in it

06:12.866 --> 06:14.216
before bedtime because
it gets her too hyper.

06:14.251 --> 06:15.167
Okay.

06:15.218 --> 06:17.086
If Chris gets cranky
around noon,

06:17.120 --> 06:18.871
just stuff some chia seeds
into a fig--

06:18.905 --> 06:20.056
works every time.

06:20.389 --> 06:21.889
Awesome, thank you.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.525
Wow, we really picked
some intense people

06:24.543 --> 06:26.594
- to spend our lives with, huh?
- Yeah.

06:26.628 --> 06:28.095
Where's Leslie?
I haven't seen her in a while.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.447
Oh, she's just running around

06:29.498 --> 06:31.683
trying to pull off an elaborate,
thoughtful surprise for you.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.267
- Of course.
- Where's Chris?

06:33.285 --> 06:35.620
I told him that <i>One Headlight</i>
<i>By the Wallflowers</i>

06:35.671 --> 06:40.041
isn't "dancing" music and he
said "Not with that attitude."

06:41.610 --> 06:43.394
Of course.

06:43.429 --> 06:47.031
Dude, Ann, you know
what I just remembered?

06:47.082 --> 06:48.583
We used to date.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.852
Yeah, we lived together
for two years.

06:50.886 --> 06:52.620
I know, it's crazy, right?

06:52.655 --> 06:54.172
Anyways, you're the best.

06:54.223 --> 06:57.692
Have fun in Mexico.

06:57.726 --> 06:59.177
Harold,
it is Leslie Knope again.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.311
I know you are
screening my calls,

07:00.346 --> 07:01.546
but if you could call me bac--

07:01.580 --> 07:02.947
And his voicemail is full.

07:02.982 --> 07:04.282
Did you have any luck?

07:04.333 --> 07:05.533
Flipped through the bylaws.

07:05.567 --> 07:06.534
I don't think
there's anything I can do.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.036
What is the point
of being married

07:08.070 --> 07:10.588
to a city manager if he can't
wield unfettered power

07:10.623 --> 07:11.806
to crush my enemies?

07:11.840 --> 07:12.857
Hopefully there are
a few other reasons.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.626
- Yeah.
- Looks like we hit a wall.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.628
Oh, God.

07:16.679 --> 07:18.279
April?
Are you okay?

07:18.314 --> 07:19.230
What's happening?

07:19.264 --> 07:20.415
I'm just so scared

07:20.449 --> 07:23.935
that this means that Ann
won't really leave.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.487
Life, huh?

07:26.505 --> 07:28.773
It's quite a ride.

07:28.807 --> 07:31.676
Yes, Tom, it is.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.828
I got you a going-away
present.

07:33.846 --> 07:35.446
I'm deleting you from my phone.

07:35.481 --> 07:37.832
You're finally free
of my animal magnetism.

07:37.866 --> 07:40.234
Maybe one day years from now
when we're both old

07:40.269 --> 07:43.638
and Chris is dead,
you'll run into me somewhere.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.157
I'll be opening
my latest mega club.

07:46.191 --> 07:47.911
I'll see you there
on the street by yourself

07:47.943 --> 07:50.862
and I'll tell
the bouncer/my bodyguard,

07:50.896 --> 07:54.332
"Hey, that woman's way too old
to get into this club,

07:54.383 --> 07:56.734
but why don't you
let her in the back?"

07:56.769 --> 07:58.686
That's very generous.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.987
Stay golden, sweetheart.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.455
I'm gonna miss you too, Tom.

08:01.473 --> 08:02.940
Shh.

08:02.975 --> 08:05.360
And you're kind
and you're thoughtful

08:05.394 --> 08:07.211
and you're always such a delight
to have around.

08:07.246 --> 08:10.648
I am sure you are going
to be an incredible mother.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.533
Thanks, Larry.
That's nice.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.218
Good-bye, Ann.

08:14.253 --> 08:17.622
I have enjoyed
parts of our time together.

08:17.656 --> 08:21.559
Oh, God, Ron.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.881
That was really something.

08:26.915 --> 08:28.816
Okay, what do
we have for Chris?

08:28.851 --> 08:31.452
I got this City of Pawnee mug.

08:31.486 --> 08:33.136
Also, this cool jacket.

08:33.188 --> 08:35.106
No, I think
that's Chris's jacket.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.323
Okay, good,
then we know he likes it.

08:36.357 --> 08:37.792
Catch up, Larry.

08:37.826 --> 08:39.760
Okay, I found some old receipts

08:39.794 --> 08:41.429
from lunches we had together.

08:41.447 --> 08:42.397
Is that anything?

08:42.431 --> 08:43.831
This is my contribution.

08:43.866 --> 08:45.199
It says "Ron."

08:45.217 --> 08:46.517
Hey, guys, what's going on?

08:46.552 --> 08:49.103
Oh, we're just giving you
a bunch of cool gifts.

08:49.121 --> 08:50.071
No, God--oh...God.

08:50.105 --> 08:52.090
Get your hopes up, Chris.

08:52.124 --> 08:53.224
Let's see what's in here.

08:53.275 --> 08:55.526
Some assorted items.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.012
And...some pieces of paper.

08:58.046 --> 08:59.764
Boom, nailed it.
All right.

08:59.798 --> 09:03.651
Now we can start
enjoying this party.

09:03.685 --> 09:06.721
Leslie, this is the most
incredible event

09:06.755 --> 09:08.139
that has ever been thrown.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.608
There is a pilgrim line dancing
with a box of candies.

09:10.659 --> 09:13.094
Why do you look so bummed out?

09:13.128 --> 09:15.379
We were planning a surprise
groundbreaking

09:15.414 --> 09:16.614
at Pawnee commons for you.

09:16.648 --> 09:18.232
You know, an actual beginning

09:18.250 --> 09:19.751
to the project
that brought us together.

09:19.785 --> 09:22.303
But now we can't do it because
Harold is such a jerk face.

09:22.337 --> 09:23.971
He put a barbed wire fence
around the lot

09:24.005 --> 09:25.656
and now it's not happening.

09:25.707 --> 09:26.991
I'm sorry, Ann.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.443
First of all, don't apologize.

09:29.461 --> 09:31.546
And second of all, screw Harold.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.714
If I learned one thing
from Leslie Knope

09:33.749 --> 09:35.716
it is we do not take "No"
for an answer.

09:35.751 --> 09:37.952
Anything is possible
if we work hard enough.

09:37.970 --> 09:39.220
- Let's do it.
- Oh, my God!

09:39.254 --> 09:40.788
Ann Perkins to the rescue.

09:40.806 --> 09:42.140
Okay, hands in, everybody.

09:42.174 --> 09:43.307
One, two, three.

09:43.342 --> 09:44.308
- Groundbreaking!
- Let's go!

09:44.343 --> 09:45.676
Dark forces, arise!

09:45.727 --> 09:47.127
Okay, I didn't plan
what we were all gonna say.

09:47.146 --> 09:48.747
That's my bad.
Here we go, Ann. Let's go.

09:53.419 --> 09:54.719
Okay, now to ring the bell.

09:54.959 --> 09:56.292
Bust in unannounced.

09:56.327 --> 10:00.046
Love it!

10:00.081 --> 10:01.131
Harold.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.132
What the hell, Knope?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.216
We need the key to the fence

10:03.250 --> 10:04.634
that you put up
on the Sullivan Street lot.

10:04.668 --> 10:06.352
You snuck around
behind my back.

10:06.387 --> 10:08.488
I told you I didn't like that.
Forget it.

10:08.522 --> 10:10.073
Come on, Harold, look.

10:10.107 --> 10:12.158
This is a great opportunity
you have right now.

10:12.193 --> 10:14.260
Just think of us as your genies

10:14.295 --> 10:15.962
who can give you
anything you want.

10:15.996 --> 10:17.280
Nothing gross.

10:17.298 --> 10:20.817
Okay, yeah,
there is something I want.

10:20.851 --> 10:22.318
Super fizzy fruity pop.

10:22.353 --> 10:23.636
Sorry?

10:23.671 --> 10:26.556
Sweetums used to stock our
office with free sodas

10:26.607 --> 10:28.808
as a promotional thing,
but that Kathryn Pinewood lady

10:28.843 --> 10:30.326
just took 'em away.

10:30.377 --> 10:33.513
If you can get us our free sodas
back, I'll get you a key.

10:33.547 --> 10:35.681
- Deal.
- Easy.

10:35.699 --> 10:37.083
It is not easy.

10:37.118 --> 10:39.252
Kathryn Pinewood is the person
on earth who hates me the most.

10:39.286 --> 10:40.487
Well, luckily,
you're with the person on earth

10:40.521 --> 10:41.521
who loves you the most.

10:41.555 --> 10:42.906
Too cheesy?
No, it's perfect.

10:42.957 --> 10:43.878
I love you.
Don't leave.

10:43.924 --> 10:45.291
Come on.

10:45.325 --> 10:47.393
Donna, you are
a remarkable woman,

10:47.427 --> 10:48.695
and I just wanted to say

10:48.729 --> 10:50.213
that I've always
thought of you as family.

10:50.247 --> 10:52.515
I just wanna say that I've
always thought you were hot.

10:52.550 --> 10:53.767
Yes, I know.

10:53.801 --> 10:54.784
April--

10:54.819 --> 10:56.786
Yeah, you saw a lot of
potential in me,

10:56.837 --> 10:59.338
I'm like a daughter to you,
and it was a treat

10:59.356 --> 11:00.857
to watch me blossom.

11:00.891 --> 11:02.625
Blah blah blah, bye.

11:02.660 --> 11:06.012
That is remarkably close
to what I was going to say.

11:06.030 --> 11:09.916
Also, I'm proud of you.

11:12.987 --> 11:14.354
Donna,
are you grabbing my butt?

11:14.388 --> 11:15.305
Can you blame me?

11:15.339 --> 11:17.557
No!

11:17.575 --> 11:19.058
Sorry, can't help you ladies.

11:19.076 --> 11:21.211
I don't have time for disgraced
former politicians

11:21.262 --> 11:22.312
and unmarried preggos.

11:22.346 --> 11:24.463
Oh, Kathryn, always a delight.

11:24.482 --> 11:25.748
Listen, I know
that you and Leslie

11:25.783 --> 11:27.417
have had your disagreements
in the past,

11:27.451 --> 11:30.303
but we really need the key,
and we can only get the key

11:30.337 --> 11:31.621
if we get the sodas.
Please?

11:31.655 --> 11:33.173
I don't see why I should do
you any favors.

11:33.207 --> 11:36.559
I mean, if you were still
a city councilor, maybe.

11:36.610 --> 11:38.778
But I seem to remember
you were recalled.

11:38.796 --> 11:39.746
Is that right?

11:39.780 --> 11:41.381
- How dare yo--
- Okay, Leslie.

11:41.415 --> 11:43.700
Please.
It's not worth it.

11:43.734 --> 11:44.667
For you.

11:44.702 --> 11:46.252
For me, I don't care.

11:46.286 --> 11:47.887
What the hell?

11:47.922 --> 11:49.138
Yeah, Pinewood, that's right.

11:49.190 --> 11:51.057
I'm pregnant
and I have you in a headlock.

11:51.075 --> 11:53.009
And if you try to fight back,
I will sue you.

11:53.043 --> 11:55.461
Unless you tell us how to get
those sodas right now.

11:55.479 --> 11:57.480
Okay, fine.

11:57.531 --> 11:59.282
Sweetums
has been desperately trying

11:59.316 --> 12:01.134
to get a local
celebrity spokesman

12:01.168 --> 12:02.302
to endorse
their new sports drink.

12:02.336 --> 12:03.903
So if you can
make that happen somehow,

12:03.937 --> 12:06.673
they'll give you
whatever you want.

12:06.707 --> 12:08.608
Damn, Perkins.

12:08.642 --> 12:11.661
Okay, who does Sweetums want
as their spokesperson?

12:11.712 --> 12:14.347
They already tried to get me
to endorse that sports drink.

12:14.381 --> 12:15.348
I said "No."

12:15.366 --> 12:16.916
They want me dunking
on the label.

12:16.951 --> 12:18.301
When is this town gonna realize

12:18.335 --> 12:20.486
that I'm more than a former
high school basketball star?

12:20.521 --> 12:23.923
I don't think this new sports
drink is even about basketball.

12:23.958 --> 12:25.758
It's called
"Sweetums dunktastic

12:25.793 --> 12:27.894
three-point B-ball blast"

12:27.912 --> 12:30.079
the slogan is
"It's all about basketball."

12:30.114 --> 12:32.482
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to find yourself

12:32.516 --> 12:35.618
some other famous pawneean.

12:37.171 --> 12:39.472
We know that you were already
approached by Sweetums

12:39.506 --> 12:41.824
and you said "No," but is there
any way you would reconsider?

12:41.859 --> 12:42.959
I'm sorry, Miss Knope.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.328
There is such a thing as
journalistic integrity,

12:45.362 --> 12:49.532
and it is something that I have
as a journalist with integrity.

12:49.567 --> 12:51.334
It's really important, Perd.

12:51.385 --> 12:53.436
Please?
Come on.

12:53.487 --> 12:54.654
For old time's sake.

12:54.688 --> 12:56.122
Well, the story of that appeal

12:56.156 --> 12:57.707
is it was heartfelt.

12:57.758 --> 13:02.161
And in response to that appeal,
I respond: Okay.

13:03.831 --> 13:05.582
For old time's sake?

13:05.616 --> 13:08.101
Does that mea--no!

13:08.135 --> 13:10.770
- Ann, you tricky minx.
- Yep.

13:10.788 --> 13:12.872
- I went on a date with Perd.
- What?

13:12.890 --> 13:14.474
It was during that
"explore my freedom

13:14.508 --> 13:15.675
as a single woman" phase.

13:15.693 --> 13:18.044
- Wow.
- We just had a drink.

13:18.078 --> 13:20.880
And at the end he said,
"I am going to kiss you now

13:20.915 --> 13:22.732
by putting my mouth
on your mouth."

13:22.783 --> 13:23.866
And then I ran away.

13:23.901 --> 13:25.668
It was absolutely
the right call.

13:25.703 --> 13:27.420
Well, we could
just tell him the truth

13:27.454 --> 13:29.722
that we feel bad that we didn't
get him anything nice.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.240
Tell the truth?

13:31.292 --> 13:32.659
That's hilarious.
No.

13:32.693 --> 13:34.293
We tell him
we had the perfect gift,

13:34.311 --> 13:35.895
but we were robbed at gunpoint.

13:35.930 --> 13:37.563
"Chris, he had a gun.

13:37.597 --> 13:39.065
He took all the gifts."

13:39.083 --> 13:41.250
Now Chris feels bad,
he's buying us gifts.

13:41.302 --> 13:43.386
Next thing you know,
Tommy's got a new watch.

13:43.437 --> 13:44.971
Again, I don't see the problem.

13:44.989 --> 13:47.957
I shook the man's hand.
Twice.

13:48.008 --> 13:51.694
Guys, look what I got at
the president's day booth.

13:51.745 --> 13:55.632
Ask not what your country
can do for you.

13:57.050 --> 13:58.651
From <i>Family Guy,</i> right?

13:58.686 --> 14:00.820
Listen, Chris, we have
to tell you something.

14:00.838 --> 14:04.256
We feel bad because you got us
such thoughtful gifts

14:04.274 --> 14:08.461
and we got you three pans
and a bag of nothing.

14:08.495 --> 14:11.097
Guys, I don't need
anything from you.

14:11.115 --> 14:13.099
My buddy boxes
are about the past,

14:13.133 --> 14:15.518
but let's focus on the future.

14:15.552 --> 14:17.637
Because we're always
gonna be friends.

14:17.671 --> 14:21.124
And just the fact that you feel
bad about your bag of nothing

14:21.158 --> 14:22.091
proves that.

14:22.142 --> 14:23.393
To the future.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.394
- Hear, hear.
- To the future.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.778
- To the future.
- Cheers.

14:25.813 --> 14:28.331
- I have an idea.
- Future.

14:30.684 --> 14:32.235
Don't you ladies ever knock?

14:32.269 --> 14:34.120
No.
Okay, so we got Perd Hapley

14:34.154 --> 14:35.254
to sign on with Sweetums,

14:35.289 --> 14:36.806
which means that
you get your sodas back,

14:36.840 --> 14:38.141
which means that we get our key.

14:38.175 --> 14:39.292
Okay? Everything's here
in writing.

14:39.326 --> 14:40.743
Now call off your guards.

14:42.663 --> 14:44.330
Okay.
Fine.

14:44.348 --> 14:46.432
You two are a couple of real
pains in the ass.

14:46.467 --> 14:47.734
You know that?

14:47.768 --> 14:49.736
Harold, your tiny brain
could not understand this,

14:49.770 --> 14:51.237
but that is the best compliment

14:51.255 --> 14:53.723
you could ever give the two
women standing in front of you.

14:53.757 --> 14:55.058
Bye, Harold.

14:55.109 --> 14:58.077
Victory at last.
Whoo!

14:58.112 --> 15:00.013
- All right.
- You're all set.

15:00.047 --> 15:01.247
Okay, I am gonna call

15:01.265 --> 15:03.716
the official ceremonial
ribbon cutting guy,

15:03.734 --> 15:04.984
'cause I think
we may have missed him.

15:06.870 --> 15:07.804
What are you doing?

15:07.838 --> 15:08.855
It's for the raccoons.

15:08.889 --> 15:10.139
You have to hiss really loud

15:10.190 --> 15:11.457
and stomp your feet
so they'll leave you alone.

15:11.492 --> 15:13.359
And if one comes close,
make yourself really large

15:13.377 --> 15:15.378
like a puffer fish.

15:15.412 --> 15:16.512
Pawnee raccoons.

15:16.547 --> 15:18.831
That is one thing
I will not miss.

15:18.866 --> 15:20.433
Well, Michigan has wolverines.

15:20.451 --> 15:22.618
Maybe they'll eat your toes.

15:22.653 --> 15:25.805
So how long do you think
you'll stay in Pawnee for?

15:25.839 --> 15:26.806
I don't know.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.974
We like it here.

15:28.992 --> 15:31.744
I made Andy promise that someday
we'll move to Transylvania,

15:31.778 --> 15:33.946
but that probably won't happen
till we're, like, 100.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.349
Well, for what it's worth,

15:36.383 --> 15:39.018
I'm really happy
that you and Andy are married.

15:39.052 --> 15:39.985
Why?

15:40.003 --> 15:43.172
Why?
Because I love him

15:43.207 --> 15:45.091
and I love you.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.610
Why wouldn't I be happy?

15:47.644 --> 15:48.945
I love you too.

15:48.979 --> 15:50.446
What's that?

15:50.497 --> 15:52.632
I love you too.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.700
I-I couldn't--I couldn't
quite hear you.

15:54.718 --> 15:56.886
Please don't make me say it.
Please.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.872
My going-away present to you

15:59.890 --> 16:03.843
will be that I do not make you
audibly say that you love me.

16:03.877 --> 16:06.879
Thank you.

16:09.216 --> 16:11.684
- What's happening here?
- Okay, Leslie's coming back.

16:11.718 --> 16:13.598
- Get off me, wench!
- Did I miss a nice moment?

16:13.604 --> 16:14.604
- No.
- Yes, you did.

16:14.655 --> 16:16.322
Oh, good.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.057
Guys, what are you doing here?

16:21.177 --> 16:21.865
Come in.

16:21.867 --> 16:24.121
You caught me before
my first run of the day.

16:24.364 --> 16:26.081
I call it my "beat the sun" run.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.996
It's a race between me
and the sun.

16:28.116 --> 16:30.886
Well, we got one more
gift for you.

16:30.888 --> 16:34.256
It's quarter-sawn zebra wood
adjoined by floating tenons

16:34.258 --> 16:36.374
to the black walnut
corner posts.

16:36.376 --> 16:38.110
Finished with a wiping varnish

16:38.112 --> 16:40.295
that's a secret
Swanson family recipe.

16:40.297 --> 16:44.066
Handmade at my woodshop,
and you are correct.

16:44.068 --> 16:45.650
It is gorgeous.

16:45.652 --> 16:48.186
You're starting a new life
with your new family,

16:48.188 --> 16:50.072
so it's an empty buddy box

16:50.074 --> 16:52.407
to fill with memories
for your little buddy.

16:52.409 --> 16:54.409
Or...twizzlers.

16:54.411 --> 16:56.394
That's the beautiful thing
about a box.

16:56.396 --> 17:00.115
We all burned
our initials in, see?

17:00.117 --> 17:04.002
Wait a minute,
who's G-J-L-G-G?

17:04.003 --> 17:05.921
That's Garry Jerry Larry
Gergich Gengurch.

17:05.923 --> 17:08.123
I burned in all my names.

17:08.125 --> 17:09.340
I really--I didn't
know what to do.

17:09.343 --> 17:11.792
Well, um...

17:11.795 --> 17:13.962
Thank you.

17:13.964 --> 17:17.415
Um, this tear, um,

17:17.416 --> 17:21.920
caused by the overwhelming
thoughtfulness of my friends

17:21.922 --> 17:24.772
will be my baby's first memory.

17:24.775 --> 17:27.608
Salt water will warp the wood.

17:27.611 --> 17:31.863
So keep your tears in your eyes
where they belong.

17:31.865 --> 17:33.365
Will do, Ron Swanson.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.851
Can I still call you

17:35.853 --> 17:38.036
when I have thoughts
on Jennifer Aniston's future?

17:38.038 --> 17:39.604
Not if I call you first.

17:39.606 --> 17:40.622
And can we still
be on the phone

17:40.624 --> 17:42.657
for every state
of the Union address

17:42.659 --> 17:45.077
and every Oscar
red carpet coverage

17:45.079 --> 17:47.629
and every single viewing
of <i>Tootsie?</i>

17:47.631 --> 17:48.880
Of course.

17:48.882 --> 17:51.500
Oh, Ann Perkins.

17:51.502 --> 17:54.219
You perfect sunflower.

17:54.221 --> 17:56.721
You totally changed me,
you know?

17:56.723 --> 17:59.141
You taught me
how to balance my life,

17:59.143 --> 18:02.427
- how to be patient.
- Mm...

18:02.429 --> 18:04.179
- How to be more patient.
- Yeah, that's better.

18:04.181 --> 18:06.631
How to throw bureaucratic
caution to the wind

18:06.633 --> 18:08.316
when it came to Ben.

18:08.318 --> 18:11.103
But most importantly,
you taught me

18:11.105 --> 18:13.405
that I can't pull off
a tulip skirt.

18:13.407 --> 18:15.440
It's just not your shape.

18:19.279 --> 18:22.697
Well, I don't think this
ceremonial ribbon cutting guy

18:22.699 --> 18:23.698
is gonna make it.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.700
Either he flaked or he tripped

18:25.702 --> 18:28.253
and impaled himself
on his own giant scissors.

18:28.255 --> 18:30.005
We wait for no man.

18:30.007 --> 18:31.339
Let's do this.

18:31.341 --> 18:34.092
One, two, three!

18:39.216 --> 18:40.849
All right, I got my park.

18:40.851 --> 18:41.967
That's all I wanted from you.

18:41.969 --> 18:42.968
Friendship over.

18:44.972 --> 18:46.771
Don't even
joke about that, Ann.

18:50.226 --> 18:52.561
It was your idea
to get me that box.

18:52.563 --> 18:54.646
Ah, it was a group effort.

18:54.648 --> 18:56.314
But it had that trademark

18:56.316 --> 18:59.818
Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful
and resourceful.

18:59.820 --> 19:04.355
You are literally the best
friend that I will ever have.

19:05.908 --> 19:09.461
You too, man.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.050
Leslie Knope.

19:15.052 --> 19:16.551
Chris Traeger.

19:16.553 --> 19:18.587
I just wanna say
that getting to know you

19:18.589 --> 19:20.639
and watching you work

19:20.641 --> 19:23.875
has been one of the greatest
experiences

19:23.877 --> 19:26.928
of my life--that and working
with Dr. Richard Nygard.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.431
Sure, and I just
want you to know

19:29.433 --> 19:31.900
that I thought
there was no man on earth

19:31.902 --> 19:34.352
good enough for Ann Perkins.

19:34.354 --> 19:36.188
- And I still think that.
- Right.

19:36.190 --> 19:39.390
But if there is no one
actually good enough for her,

19:39.392 --> 19:43.411
you are pretty damn close.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.738
Okay, well, this is normal.

19:53.740 --> 19:54.739
No big deal.

19:54.741 --> 19:56.675
- Drive safe.
- We will.

19:56.677 --> 19:58.376
I packed you some sandwiches

19:58.378 --> 20:00.679
and some caffeine free iced tea.

20:00.681 --> 20:02.914
So--oh, and there's a mix CD
that I made

20:02.916 --> 20:04.883
already loaded in your car.

20:04.885 --> 20:06.417
There's a lot of
Sarah McLanahan,

20:06.419 --> 20:07.886
so, Chris, I apologize.

20:07.888 --> 20:09.888
Things are gonna get emotional.

20:12.759 --> 20:14.559
I love you.

20:14.561 --> 20:18.596
I love you too.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.074

20:30.309 --> 20:34.079
Breakfast, Knope?

20:34.081 --> 20:36.981
Oh, I don't know.

20:36.983 --> 20:38.250
Come on.

20:38.252 --> 20:40.318
There has never been a sadness

20:40.320 --> 20:42.504
that can't be cured
by breakfast food.

20:42.506 --> 20:44.339
That's fair.

20:44.341 --> 20:46.625
Someone else is gonna
have to drive though.

20:46.627 --> 20:48.326
My eyes are basically
useless right now.

20:48.328 --> 20:49.594
I'm on it.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.062
Shotgun!
I called shotgun!

20:51.064 --> 20:52.847
- You're all nailed.
- I call sitting on your lap.

20:52.849 --> 20:54.232
You can't--I--double shotgun!

20:54.234 --> 20:55.483
We call double shotgun!

20:55.485 --> 20:56.801
How come people
don't do that more often?

20:56.803 --> 20:57.969
It's illegal.

20:57.971 --> 20:59.604
Raise you hand
if you want waffles.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.855
I'm eating waffles.

21:00.857 --> 21:02.857
Bacon and eggs,
please and thank you.

21:02.859 --> 21:05.693
â™ª You belong somewhere
you feel free â™ª
