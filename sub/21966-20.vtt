00:01.041 --> 00:04.333
( helicopter blades whirring )

00:04.375 --> 00:07.041
(  heroic theme playing  )

00:12.208 --> 00:15.041
Second level secure.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.208
Salvage, Blurr,

00:16.250 --> 00:17.667
come help with the next

00:16.250 --> 00:17.667
platform.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.834
That cable's gonna break!

00:28.875 --> 00:31.375
Rescue Bots,

00:28.875 --> 00:31.375
leap to the rescue.

00:32.583 --> 00:34.583
( all grunt )

00:37.375 --> 00:39.834
( all scream )

00:39.875 --> 00:42.208

00:43.750 --> 00:45.208
( grunts )

00:45.250 --> 00:47.000
( all groan )

00:47.041 --> 00:49.667
Salvage, Blurr, help us.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.000
Help.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.917
Blurr, where are you?

00:54.959 --> 00:56.959
Blurr, get down here!

HEATWAVE:

Blurr, get down here!

01:39.583 --> 01:40.583
Stop VR.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.333
( sighs )

01:55.375 --> 01:57.834
We've been using this virtual

01:55.375 --> 01:57.834
training program all week.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.959
And you haven't gotten

01:57.875 --> 01:59.959
one rescue right yet.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.709
We did throw 'em

02:00.000 --> 02:02.709
a bit of a curveball that time.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.291
Though, in context,

02:02.750 --> 02:04.291
a falling platform

02:04.333 --> 02:06.041
was not entirely

02:04.333 --> 02:06.041
unexpected.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.834
You just stood there.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.834
Why did you freeze?

02:08.875 --> 02:12.375
The tactical choice. Somebody

02:08.875 --> 02:12.375
had to be free to handle things

02:12.417 --> 02:13.667
if the rescue went wrong.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.041
Which it did.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.792
Actually,

02:15.083 --> 02:16.792
not a bad answer.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.959
It wouldn't have gone wrong

02:16.834 --> 02:18.959
if you'd have helped.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.417
Okay, bad answer.

02:21.458 --> 02:24.333
It's called teamwork

02:21.458 --> 02:24.333
for a reason.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.875
That's it.

02:25.917 --> 02:28.000
No more Rescue Force training

02:25.917 --> 02:28.000
for you till further notice.

02:28.041 --> 02:29.917
BLURR:

02:28.041 --> 02:29.917
Oh, come on, Captain.

02:29.959 --> 02:31.417
It's just a simulator.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.917
I'll be there

02:31.458 --> 02:32.917
when it really counts.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.709
( sighs )

02:35.959 --> 02:37.834
Sorry to let you down,

02:35.959 --> 02:37.834
Optimus.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.834
I tried giving this guy

02:37.875 --> 02:39.834
a second chance,

02:39.875 --> 02:42.333
but it's just not working.

02:42.375 --> 02:45.250
I await your instructions.

02:42.375 --> 02:45.250
Heatwave out.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.917
Maybe Blurr just needs

02:45.291 --> 02:47.917
more time.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.041
Time is not the problem.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.625
Just ask them.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.583
Ask us what?

02:57.625 --> 02:59.417
About training

02:57.625 --> 02:59.417
Blurr and Salvage.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.083
Salvage seems

02:59.458 --> 03:02.083
an ideal student.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.917
Blurr's more like the kid

03:02.125 --> 03:03.917
you wish would get transferred

03:03.959 --> 03:05.750
to another class.

03:05.792 --> 03:08.041
Or his dad would get a new job

03:05.792 --> 03:08.041
and they'd have to move.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.083
Or a meteor

03:08.083 --> 03:10.083
would hit the school and--

03:10.125 --> 03:13.250
That's it.

03:10.125 --> 03:13.250
The job, or the meteor?

03:13.291 --> 03:15.625
Other classes.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.625
Instead of VR training,

03:15.667 --> 03:16.959
you guys could split up

03:17.000 --> 03:18.959
and teach them different things

03:17.000 --> 03:18.959
separately.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.709
Like a... Rescue Bots Academy.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.291
I could provide them

03:21.750 --> 03:23.291
with reading material

03:23.333 --> 03:25.125
and in-house

03:23.333 --> 03:25.125
task assignments.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.291
I think you mean homework,

03:25.166 --> 03:27.291
Chase.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.959
( gasps ):

03:27.333 --> 03:28.959
I know.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.625
Videos. It's the best way

03:29.000 --> 03:31.625
to learn.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.041
Yeah, not so sure about that.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.959
Look at all I've learned

03:34.083 --> 03:36.959
from television.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.083
We could show them examples

03:38.750 --> 03:41.083
of rescues we've made,

03:41.125 --> 03:42.542
experiences we've had.

03:42.583 --> 03:43.959
Good idea, Blades.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.166
I have already catalogued video

03:44.000 --> 03:46.166
of all our rescues

03:46.208 --> 03:48.083
from security camera footage.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.125
It would make excellent

03:48.125 --> 03:50.125
teaching material.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.959
I better start putting

03:50.166 --> 03:52.959
my highlight reel together.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.667
Welcome to Rescue Bots Academy.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.166
Do I need to be here?

03:56.709 --> 03:59.166
I gotta get my laps in.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.083
But it's also important

03:59.208 --> 04:01.083
to study,

04:01.125 --> 04:02.834
especially if you're going

04:01.125 --> 04:02.834
to be a Rescue Bot.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.250
( Chase clears throat )

04:04.291 --> 04:06.792
My video database

04:04.291 --> 04:06.792
can be sorted alphabetically,

04:06.834 --> 04:11.667
chronologically, by risk level,

04:06.834 --> 04:11.667
or, my favorite, by category.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.625
Impressive.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.625
Thank you.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.166
I recommend you take notes,

04:13.667 --> 04:16.166
as there will be a quiz.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.542
Now, let's spin

04:16.208 --> 04:18.542
the category wheel.

04:22.709 --> 04:25.583
Ah, environmental

04:22.709 --> 04:25.583
emergencies.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.625
Which we seem to have

04:25.625 --> 04:27.625
a disproportionate share of

04:27.667 --> 04:28.875
on this island.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.333
We have a situation

04:30.792 --> 04:32.333
on Main and Park.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.041
Sewer's overflowing.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.583
With lava.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.250
( gasps )

04:42.041 --> 04:43.959
( grunts )

04:45.959 --> 04:47.291
DOC:

04:45.959 --> 04:47.291
When we're directly above it,

04:47.333 --> 04:50.250
we drop this:

04:47.333 --> 04:50.250
the Torna-don't.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.291
( electricity crackling )

04:58.417 --> 05:00.625
( screams )

05:03.875 --> 05:06.792
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

05:03.875 --> 05:06.792
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

05:13.125 --> 05:16.291
Which brings us to another

05:13.125 --> 05:16.291
category: Earth animals.

05:16.333 --> 05:19.291
The relationship between humans

05:16.333 --> 05:19.291
and other species

05:19.333 --> 05:21.792
can cause a variety

05:19.333 --> 05:21.792
of mishaps.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.166
( grunts )

05:24.208 --> 05:25.417
( screeches )

05:25.458 --> 05:27.083
Look out!

05:27.125 --> 05:28.417
( tires screech )

05:28.458 --> 05:30.500
( screaming )

05:33.166 --> 05:35.291
( roars )

05:39.208 --> 05:40.333
Hiya!

05:40.375 --> 05:42.959
( roars )

05:43.000 --> 05:45.208
( screams )

05:45.250 --> 05:46.875
( whimpers )

05:46.917 --> 05:48.583
( lobsters chirping )

05:54.166 --> 05:57.291
Heading down to the clock

05:54.166 --> 05:57.291
dedica-aation!

05:58.417 --> 06:00.375
( screams )

06:00.417 --> 06:01.625
Whoa!

06:03.083 --> 06:05.166
Ugh, hate to break it

06:03.083 --> 06:05.166
to you, Chase,

06:05.208 --> 06:06.667
but that air freshener?

06:06.709 --> 06:08.458
So not cutting it.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.000
Curse you, Mr. Pettypaws.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.375
( sneezing )

06:15.667 --> 06:17.041
( hisses )

06:17.083 --> 06:18.166
( meows )

06:18.208 --> 06:20.458
( snarling )

06:20.500 --> 06:22.125
CODY: Whoa!

06:20.500 --> 06:22.125
HEATWAVE: Yee-haw!

06:22.166 --> 06:23.667
BLURR:

06:22.166 --> 06:23.667
What kind of animal is that?

06:23.709 --> 06:25.875
My mistake.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.875
A mechanical bull,

06:25.917 --> 06:28.041
which should be categorized

06:25.917 --> 06:28.041
under Tech Gone Wrong.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.917
CODY:

06:28.083 --> 06:29.917
Not wrong, Chase.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.875
We just haven't found

06:29.959 --> 06:31.875
the right use for it yet.

06:31.917 --> 06:33.208
I'm with you there.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.500
Everything finds

06:33.250 --> 06:35.500
its purpose, right?

06:35.542 --> 06:37.542
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.333
What is this thing, anyway?

06:43.375 --> 06:45.333
A small tube that--

06:49.583 --> 06:51.208
Chase, behind you!

06:51.250 --> 06:53.041
You are hindering

06:53.083 --> 06:56.041
an officer of the law--

07:07.500 --> 07:09.417
( roars )

07:14.458 --> 07:16.917
( motor powering up )

07:19.667 --> 07:22.041
CHASE:

07:19.667 --> 07:22.041
Ah, yes. The Red Zone.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.250
An important part

07:22.083 --> 07:24.250
of Earth technology.

07:24.291 --> 07:27.417
Briefly, the lesson is:

07:24.291 --> 07:27.417
Always avoid it.

07:27.458 --> 07:30.375
Don't leave it at that level

07:27.458 --> 07:30.375
for very long,

07:30.417 --> 07:33.333
or the system

07:30.417 --> 07:33.333
will overload.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.000
You'll want to avoid

07:33.375 --> 07:35.000
raising the power

07:35.041 --> 07:36.625
into the red zone too often,

07:36.667 --> 07:38.667
or you could overload

07:36.667 --> 07:38.667
the badge.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.667
Uh, Dad, what's wrong

07:38.709 --> 07:41.667
with my badge?

07:41.709 --> 07:44.417
( electricity crackling )

07:41.709 --> 07:44.417
Must be overloaded.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.583
Aah!

07:45.625 --> 07:47.542
( alarm blaring )

07:47.583 --> 07:49.417
Do we need

07:47.583 --> 07:49.417
to evacuate the town?

07:49.458 --> 07:51.667
We're losing Cody and Blades.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.458
( thunder crashes )

07:54.458 --> 07:55.625
Run for cover!

07:55.667 --> 07:57.458
( all scream )

07:59.333 --> 08:00.542
Optimus, no!

08:03.166 --> 08:05.500
( roars )

08:07.250 --> 08:08.500
And there you have it.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.417
Please use

08:10.125 --> 08:12.417
a No. 2 pencil only.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.709
Points will be taken off

08:12.458 --> 08:14.709
for sloppiness.

08:14.750 --> 08:18.542
Chase, I have to take

08:14.750 --> 08:18.542
this test too?

08:18.583 --> 08:21.000
Refresher courses are never

08:18.583 --> 08:21.000
a waste of time.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.667
DANI:

08:21.041 --> 08:22.667
Emergency call just came in.

08:22.709 --> 08:23.917
Thank goodness.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.208
There's a window washer

08:25.250 --> 08:26.917
stuck on his hover platform

08:25.250 --> 08:26.917
downtown.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.458
Oh, exciting stuff.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.208
Boulder, you and Blades

08:28.500 --> 08:30.208
take 'em.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.208
Chase, Chief wants you and me

08:30.250 --> 08:33.208
to stay here on call.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.083
You Bots want to ride along?

08:33.250 --> 08:36.083
That's not gonna happen.

08:36.125 --> 08:38.375
Just bring the guy down, right?

08:36.125 --> 08:38.375
How hard can it be?

08:38.417 --> 08:41.959
No harder than unloading

08:38.417 --> 08:41.959
a platform from a helicopter.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.166
It was a simulation.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.000
Give them a chance, Heatwave.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.000
They've have been studying.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.208
Right, guys?

08:49.250 --> 08:51.041
And we'll keep an eye

08:49.250 --> 08:51.041
on 'em.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.458
All right.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.208
But I'll be watching.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.625
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:

08:55.458 --> 08:56.625
Going up.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.083
Secure all safety harnesses.

08:59.125 --> 09:02.375
Going up.

08:59.125 --> 09:02.375
Secure all safety harnesses.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.291
( sighs )

09:02.417 --> 09:04.291
Going up.

09:04.333 --> 09:07.000
Secure all safety harnesses.

09:04.333 --> 09:07.000
DANI: Get you down in a sec!

09:09.625 --> 09:13.959
Going up.

09:09.625 --> 09:13.959
Secure all safety harnesses.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.458
Ah, should've brought

09:17.208 --> 09:19.458
Heatwave's ladder.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.166
I can make you one.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.166
Need a couple minutes.

09:31.166 --> 09:34.250
You guys are way

09:31.166 --> 09:34.250
overthinking this.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.166
( grunts )

09:37.208 --> 09:39.083
ALL:

09:37.208 --> 09:39.083
No!

09:39.125 --> 09:41.125
( grunts )

09:41.166 --> 09:43.375
Whoa! Aah!

09:46.041 --> 09:47.417
( screaming )

09:53.291 --> 09:54.667
Dr. McSwain's

09:53.291 --> 09:54.667
just around the corner.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.083
( groans )

09:59.208 --> 10:00.625
We'll take care of him.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.625
What?

10:11.667 --> 10:13.208
We're supposed to consider

10:13.250 --> 10:15.000
people's safety first.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.542
Everybody else

10:15.041 --> 10:16.542
was standing around yakking.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.208
I took action.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.625
Isn't that what

10:18.250 --> 10:19.625
we're supposed to do?

10:19.667 --> 10:22.208
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:

10:19.667 --> 10:22.208
Going up. Going up.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.375
Going...

10:24.417 --> 10:26.291
( sighs )

10:29.000 --> 10:31.417
Never know.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.417
Might come in handy.

10:34.083 --> 10:38.041
Blurr, you put one

10:34.083 --> 10:38.041
of my citizens in harm's way.

10:38.083 --> 10:41.458
It won't happen again, Chief.

10:38.083 --> 10:41.458
I'll make sure.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.667
Why do we even bother?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.583
All humans do

10:42.709 --> 10:44.583
is get into trouble.

10:44.625 --> 10:48.041
You think Optimus just chose

10:44.625 --> 10:48.041
this planet randomly?

10:48.083 --> 10:49.625
We're here for a reason.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.041
Autobots and humans

10:49.667 --> 10:52.041
share a common destiny,

10:52.083 --> 10:53.959
and have for centuries.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.750
We should know that

10:54.000 --> 10:56.750
better than anybody.

10:56.792 --> 10:58.750
Maybe if you learned

10:56.792 --> 10:58.750
more about humans,

10:58.792 --> 11:00.333
you'd like them better.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.250
They're actually

11:00.375 --> 11:02.250
pretty fascinating.

11:02.291 --> 11:03.583
I'll tell you one thing.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.000
You couldn't ask

11:03.625 --> 11:05.000
for better partners

11:05.041 --> 11:06.542
than the Burns Family.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.583
They're as loyal as any Bots

11:06.583 --> 11:08.583
I've ever known.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.125
Filed under T for "Teamwork."

11:13.125 --> 11:15.125
I'll understand if you don't

11:13.125 --> 11:15.125
want to be part of this mission.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.458
It's dangerous, and Griffin Rock

11:15.166 --> 11:18.458
isn't your home.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.208
Wherever there is

11:18.500 --> 11:20.208
an emergency,

11:20.250 --> 11:23.291
there are Rescue Bots ready

11:20.250 --> 11:23.291
to serve, save, and protect.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.083
We didn't have the chance

11:23.333 --> 11:26.083
to save our home.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.083
We won't let you

11:26.125 --> 11:28.083
lose yours.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.125
The lava's moving too fast.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.250
( rocks crumbling )

11:32.291 --> 11:34.625
Good a place as any

11:32.291 --> 11:34.625
to hold our ground.

11:42.166 --> 11:43.625
BLADES:

11:42.166 --> 11:43.625
I can't see.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.625
Aah!

11:43.667 --> 11:45.625
I'll guide you.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.583
You're right-side up.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.583
Just take us as high as you can.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.250
It's okay if you go slow.

11:50.291 --> 11:51.667
Here goes nothing.

11:55.375 --> 12:00.375
We saved everyone.

11:55.375 --> 12:00.375
This is high-five time.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.333
No one?

12:06.667 --> 12:08.208
All right,

12:06.667 --> 12:08.208
I have a question.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.458
Dani. She's different

12:08.250 --> 12:11.458
from the others.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.333
Yes. Humans come in subsets

12:11.500 --> 12:14.333
of male and female,

12:14.375 --> 12:17.125
each having its own variety

12:14.375 --> 12:17.125
of what Cody and Frankie

12:17.166 --> 12:19.208
refer to as "cooties."

12:19.250 --> 12:21.250
But only the males can have

12:21.291 --> 12:22.834
the thing

12:21.291 --> 12:22.834
above their lip, right?

12:22.875 --> 12:24.500
Ah, yes, the mustache.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.709
It appears to be a point

12:24.542 --> 12:26.709
of pride with some people,

12:26.750 --> 12:28.333
like Chief.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.750
We don't know exactly

12:28.375 --> 12:29.750
how it works,

12:29.792 --> 12:32.667
but somehow it seems

12:29.792 --> 12:32.667
to make him more huggable.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.166
( laughs )

12:35.208 --> 12:36.500
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.208
( grunts )

12:38.250 --> 12:39.500
CHASE:

12:38.250 --> 12:39.500
The Burnses, in general,

12:39.542 --> 12:41.291
are an affectionate family.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.792
Not gonna make this a habit

12:43.375 --> 12:44.792
or nothing,

12:44.834 --> 12:46.667
but give me a hug.

12:46.709 --> 12:48.542
It's okay,

12:46.709 --> 12:48.542
you don't have to--

12:48.583 --> 12:50.417
Okay.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.709
Although human affection

12:50.458 --> 12:52.709
is sometimes expressed

12:52.750 --> 12:54.208
in other ways.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.208
( both laugh )

12:56.250 --> 12:59.208
This gesture appears to be

12:56.250 --> 12:59.208
universal in sibling relations.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.291
Now that I get.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.875
It's true, humans do get

13:01.333 --> 13:03.875
into a lot of trouble.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.166
But that's one of the reasons

13:03.917 --> 13:06.166
we're here.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.542
Has anybody else

13:06.208 --> 13:07.542
ever noticed

13:07.583 --> 13:11.333
how Cody seems to attract

13:07.583 --> 13:11.333
falling objects?

13:11.375 --> 13:12.834
Noticed and catalogued.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.709
The roof's

13:14.750 --> 13:16.709
about to collapse.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.583
( gasps )

13:31.625 --> 13:34.417
All right, I get it,

13:31.625 --> 13:34.417
you've all become friends.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.750
But I still think,

13:34.458 --> 13:36.750
for the most part,

13:36.792 --> 13:39.166
humans are just silly.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.917
Okay, I'm gonna shoot

13:46.291 --> 13:47.917
over the hoop,

13:47.959 --> 13:51.291
bounce it off Blades' canopy,

13:47.959 --> 13:51.291
and back into the basket.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.667
Yeah, right.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.667
Those physics aren't possible.

13:52.709 --> 13:54.333
Can't you use

13:52.709 --> 13:54.333
Chase's windshield?

13:54.375 --> 13:56.125
If Dani says

13:54.375 --> 13:56.125
she can do it...

14:05.166 --> 14:06.917
She didn't do it.

14:06.959 --> 14:08.583
GRAHAM: Physics wins.

14:06.959 --> 14:08.583
DANI: Oh, Blades, you flinched.

14:08.625 --> 14:09.834
BLADES:

14:08.625 --> 14:09.834
You be the backboard.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.750
Blurr?

14:12.792 --> 14:14.583
What do you call

14:12.792 --> 14:14.583
that game anyway?

14:14.625 --> 14:17.500
Burns Ball. Our family

14:14.625 --> 14:17.500
just kind of made it up.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.291
Well, the Bots helped.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.291
Uh, you wanna play?

14:20.333 --> 14:22.583
I'm good here, thanks.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.333
You know,

14:22.625 --> 14:24.333
Heatwave was like that

14:24.375 --> 14:25.959
when he first came

14:24.375 --> 14:25.959
to Griffin Rock.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.959
All he wanted was for Optimus

14:26.000 --> 14:28.959
to reassign him.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.750
Hothead. Really.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.750
So why'd he stay?

14:32.792 --> 14:34.291
He got to know everybody,

14:34.333 --> 14:36.333
and kind of became

14:34.333 --> 14:36.333
part of the family.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.417
I'm more of a go-it-alone

14:36.375 --> 14:39.417
kind of Bot, kid.

14:39.458 --> 14:43.375
Not too great

14:39.458 --> 14:43.375
at this teamwork stuff.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.917
Okay, but I'm not

14:43.417 --> 14:45.917
giving up on you.

14:45.959 --> 14:48.458
Someday,

14:45.959 --> 14:48.458
when the time comes,

14:48.500 --> 14:50.166
I know you'll do

14:48.500 --> 14:50.166
the right thing.

14:54.417 --> 14:57.458
Humans. Silly and stubborn.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.709
( laughter )

15:07.041 --> 15:08.583
( tires screeching )

15:11.542 --> 15:15.333
Ha! Figured I'd find you here.

15:11.542 --> 15:15.333
Scrap surfing as usual.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.750
Well, need an audio output

15:15.375 --> 15:18.750
to finish a repurposing project.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.375
Red buttons, or yellow?

15:21.417 --> 15:23.500
Now you've made yourself right

15:21.417 --> 15:23.500
at home here, haven't you?

15:23.542 --> 15:25.417
Scrapyard's nice.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.750
And the other Bots.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.750
Even the humans.

15:27.792 --> 15:31.333
Everything and everybody

15:27.792 --> 15:31.333
seems to have a place.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.875
Not quite everybody.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.750
Figures.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.834
You're not thinking

15:39.792 --> 15:41.834
about leaving, are you?

15:41.875 --> 15:44.875
Me? Nah. Be nice to take

15:41.875 --> 15:44.875
a break, though.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.542
Ever been to Velocitron?

15:47.583 --> 15:51.458
Nice planet. All roads, no speed

15:47.583 --> 15:51.458
limits. Great spot to relax.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.709
Hm. Sounds boring.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.709
You gonna pick those up?

15:54.750 --> 15:55.917
( sighs )

15:55.959 --> 15:57.750
I gotta go unwind.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.375
( engine revs )

16:00.417 --> 16:02.542
( tires screech )

16:02.583 --> 16:04.959
( crackling )

16:07.500 --> 16:10.709
Okay, Graham.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.709
Should be ready.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.709
( console beeping )

16:12.750 --> 16:14.667
The voice chip from

16:12.750 --> 16:14.667
the window-washer platform

16:14.709 --> 16:17.542
was just what we needed

16:14.709 --> 16:17.542
to finish this upgrade.

16:17.583 --> 16:18.959
We call it

16:19.000 --> 16:21.041
the Empathically Reactive

16:19.000 --> 16:21.041
Voice-Interactive System.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.333
Or for short, ERVIS.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.458
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:

16:23.375 --> 16:25.458
My name is ERVIS.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.875
Please let me assist you.

16:27.917 --> 16:30.333
Not crazy about that voice,

16:27.917 --> 16:30.333
though.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.041
How about this one?

16:32.083 --> 16:33.583
( in Southern belle voice ):

16:32.083 --> 16:33.583
How can I help y'all,

16:33.625 --> 16:34.875
sweetheart?

16:33.625 --> 16:34.875
No, thanks.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.583
Nah.

16:36.625 --> 16:40.000
( in goofy voice ):

16:36.625 --> 16:40.000
Hi. I like you. Do you like me?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.583
Ew.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.583
Sounds pretty needy.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.750
Did I program that?

16:42.792 --> 16:44.291
( in normal voice ):

16:42.792 --> 16:44.291
Hello.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.917
What can I do for you?

16:45.959 --> 16:47.417
Nice.

16:45.959 --> 16:47.417
I like it.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.000
CHIEF:

16:47.458 --> 16:49.000
Team, we just got a call

16:49.041 --> 16:51.458
about a race car

16:49.041 --> 16:51.458
running red lights in town.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.417
Is Blurr with you guys?

16:53.458 --> 16:55.083
No.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.083
I can't believe it.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.417
He's going around

16:55.125 --> 16:57.417
without a driver?

16:57.458 --> 16:59.875
And violating traffic laws.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.375
(  rock theme playing  )

17:03.959 --> 17:05.917
Hey!

17:05.959 --> 17:07.542
( tires screech )

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
( tires screeching )

17:25.667 --> 17:27.500
( electronic beeping )

17:29.667 --> 17:31.792
What?

17:29.667 --> 17:31.792
( police sirens wailing )

17:35.125 --> 17:37.667
Whoa, Horace Burns down.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.917
Team, take care

17:37.709 --> 17:39.917
of the statue and Blurr.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.000
I'll talk to Jerry.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.166
Uh, Chief,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.166
nobody's at the wheel.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.792
It's Doc Greene's

17:48.208 --> 17:50.792
new experiment.

17:50.834 --> 17:53.917
A self-driving car

17:50.834 --> 17:53.917
that makes racing safer.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.959
I think it still needs

17:53.959 --> 17:55.959
some work.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.750
CHIEF:

17:56.000 --> 17:57.750
I'll tell Doc you said so.

18:01.834 --> 18:04.834
I've never seen Heatwave

18:01.834 --> 18:04.834
so mad.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.875
Not even Kade

18:04.875 --> 18:06.875
upsets him like that.

18:12.583 --> 18:13.875
( grunts )

18:13.917 --> 18:16.709
Hey! You gonna

18:13.917 --> 18:16.709
put me down?

18:16.750 --> 18:19.500
No talking. No transforming.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.500
Drive slow.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.000
Firehouse. Now.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.208
( machinery whirring

18:27.458 --> 18:29.208
and beeping )

18:29.250 --> 18:32.542
It was one

18:29.250 --> 18:32.542
little accident.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.083
Two. First the window washer,

18:34.125 --> 18:37.166
now you put us all in danger

18:34.125 --> 18:37.166
by nearly blowing our cover.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.041
Well, I wouldn't have crashed

18:37.208 --> 18:39.041
if you'd just let me--

18:39.083 --> 18:41.166
No more excuses.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.750
You're the one responsible

18:41.208 --> 18:43.750
for your actions.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.875
Until you get that through

18:43.792 --> 18:45.875
your thick metal head,

18:45.917 --> 18:47.959
you stay at the firehouse.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.959
Got it?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.583
Oh, confinement. Really?

18:50.625 --> 18:53.041
Taking the easy way out,

18:50.625 --> 18:53.041
aren't ya?

18:53.083 --> 18:56.417
Believe me,

18:53.083 --> 18:56.417
nothing about you is easy.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.500
Thanks for your support,

18:57.291 --> 18:59.500
everybody.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.125
Good, you're back.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.625
I put in that laser component

19:04.166 --> 19:06.625
on the Sigma.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.083
We'll take a look.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.458
BLURR:

19:15.875 --> 19:18.458
This has been here

19:15.875 --> 19:18.458
the whole time?

19:20.041 --> 19:21.208
BLADES:

19:20.041 --> 19:21.208
Here you are!

19:21.250 --> 19:22.625
Um, I heard about you

19:22.667 --> 19:24.583
not being able to leave

19:22.667 --> 19:24.583
the firehouse.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.792
But that's perfect,

19:24.625 --> 19:26.792
because I just finished

19:26.834 --> 19:28.917
my training video!

19:28.959 --> 19:31.166
Look, Blades,

19:28.959 --> 19:31.166
now's not the best time to--

19:31.208 --> 19:32.917
What else do you

19:31.208 --> 19:32.917
have to do?

19:32.959 --> 19:34.667
Come on, everybody.

19:34.709 --> 19:37.542
Rescue Bots Academy

19:34.709 --> 19:37.542
is back in session.

19:37.583 --> 19:40.709
I-I think I'll sit

19:37.583 --> 19:40.709
this one out.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.667
Okay, everybody

19:49.667 --> 19:52.667
get comfortable.

19:52.709 --> 19:53.959
We ready?

19:54.000 --> 19:58.125
'Cause this is epic.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.166
CHASE: Just get this over with.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.166
DANI: Hit it, Blades.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.625
( grunts )

20:07.667 --> 20:09.709
( helicopter blades whirring )

20:10.250 --> 20:13.125
CHASE:

20:10.250 --> 20:13.125
Blades, I cannot help but notice

20:13.166 --> 20:16.792
that all of these examples

20:13.166 --> 20:16.792
are focused on you.

20:16.834 --> 20:18.208
BLADES:

20:16.834 --> 20:18.208
Well, yeah.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.542
How else are they going to learn

20:18.250 --> 20:21.542
to do air rescues?

20:21.583 --> 20:24.250
CHASE:

20:21.583 --> 20:24.250
But neither Blurr

20:21.583 --> 20:24.250
nor Salvage can fly.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.917
SALVAGE:

20:24.291 --> 20:25.917
I could probably rig up

20:25.959 --> 20:27.709
one of those scoop

20:25.959 --> 20:27.709
attachments.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.125
BLADES:

20:27.750 --> 20:30.125
Shh. This is my favorite part.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.083
With a slo-mo replay.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.625
Well, since you asked.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.667
DANI ( on screen ):

20:33.667 --> 20:35.667
Spin! Hard!

20:35.709 --> 20:39.041
BLADES ( on screen ):

20:35.709 --> 20:39.041
Whoo-hoo!

20:41.792 --> 20:43.834
HEATWAVE:

20:41.792 --> 20:43.834
I'm still waiting

20:41.792 --> 20:43.834
to hear from Optimus.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.166
But as soon as I do...

20:45.208 --> 20:46.667
CHIEF:

20:45.208 --> 20:46.667
It's your team, Heatwave.

20:46.709 --> 20:47.875
Your decision.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.792
And I've made it.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.792
Blurr has to go.

20:52.291 --> 20:55.625
What do you know?

20:52.291 --> 20:55.625
We do agree on something.

21:00.625 --> 21:01.792
Blurr?

21:01.834 --> 21:03.875
Where'd he go?

21:06.625 --> 21:08.792
( rumbling )

21:08.834 --> 21:10.083
Blurr, wait!

21:11.125 --> 21:12.250
Whoa!

21:12.291 --> 21:13.291
( grunts )

21:17.917 --> 21:19.875
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

21:22.750 --> 21:24.250
( grunts )

21:25.333 --> 21:27.834
This is not good.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )
