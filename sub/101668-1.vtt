00:20.387 --> 00:22.456
Several localities
across the metro area

00:22.489 --> 00:24.458
are in chaos at this hour.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.594
Reports of gunfire and explosions
from multiple locations

00:27.627 --> 00:29.931
around Atlanta
continue to pour in.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.900
It all started almost an
hour ago when a man hijacked

00:32.934 --> 00:34.668
a postal truck and
drove it through

00:34.702 --> 00:36.904
the front of a home
improvement store in Buckhead.

00:36.938 --> 00:39.673
A man then began shooting
and stabbing individuals

00:39.707 --> 00:40.474
in the store.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.045
Since then, police and
fire units have been trying

00:44.078 --> 00:46.480
to respond to a growing
number of incidents,

00:46.513 --> 00:49.884
but the streets are clogged
with the rush hour drivers.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.986
News Center Eight
has just received confirmation

00:52.019 --> 00:53.788
of another event, Jim.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.423
According to Georgia DOT,
what witnesses are calling

00:56.456 --> 00:59.459
a truck bomb has just
been detonated on the 85

00:59.493 --> 01:02.562
north ramp lanes near the
top of Spaghetti Junction.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.431
The lanes effected by
the brunt of the blast

01:04.464 --> 01:06.466
have crumbled and fallen.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.301
Dear God.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.337
No word on the
number of dead or wounded yet,

01:10.370 --> 01:13.741
but an estimated 12 to 16
vehicles, including a school bus,

01:13.775 --> 01:16.744
were seen dropped into
the destroyed railway.

01:16.778 --> 01:19.579
Paramedics, fire, and
rescue, and team road units

01:19.613 --> 01:21.414
are en route to the scene.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.618
We'll keep you updated as
more information comes out.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.453
Metro area
hospitals are bracing

01:26.486 --> 01:29.422
for the incoming wave of
wounded from these events.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.725
News Center Eight
has received word

01:30.758 --> 01:32.626
that Grady Hospital
is calling in

01:32.659 --> 01:35.029
all off duty medical
personnel to deal

01:35.062 --> 01:36.864
with the swelling
number of patients.

01:36.898 --> 01:39.466
Other area hospitals are
expected to follow suit.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.904
So if you are a member of the
Grady Hospital medical staff,

01:42.937 --> 01:45.773
please report to work
as soon as possible.

01:45.807 --> 01:47.340
You are sorely needed.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.475
Are you seeing this?

01:48.508 --> 01:50.077
Well,
of course I saw.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.578
It's all over the news.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.579
Alison.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.548
Look, Theresa.

01:54.581 --> 01:55.615
You are gonna need
every pair of hands

01:55.649 --> 01:57.450
that you can muster today.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.687
Bullshit administrative
leave or not.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.356
Your privileges
have been revoked, Alison,

02:03.390 --> 02:04.992
you can't even set
foot in the hospital

02:05.026 --> 02:06.660
without a board vote.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.562
I am the best trauma
doctor that you have.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.064
You're a liability.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.631
I need to be there!

02:11.665 --> 02:12.967
Not gonna happen.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.969
Stay at home and
keep your head down.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.636
I'll call you if
anything changes,

02:16.670 --> 02:18.139
but don't hold your breath.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.473
Look, Theresa.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.409
I can do whatever
the hospital needs.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.644
- It doesn't have to be-
- I've gotta go, Alison.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.083
Fucking bureaucrats!

02:36.423 --> 02:37.457
Things aren't
slowing down either,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.559
at the iconic Marietta Landmark,

02:39.593 --> 02:42.662
the big chicken is
engulfed in fire

02:42.696 --> 02:44.497
after an explosion inside.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.533
A group of customers
and staff have gotten

02:46.566 --> 02:48.435
out of the building, but
the blaze is out of control

02:48.468 --> 02:51.404
and currently threatening
nearby structures.

02:51.438 --> 02:55.009
We cannot rightfully
confirm this fire is...

02:55.042 --> 02:57.510
Theresa's letting you go in?

02:57.544 --> 02:59.512
Hospital's swamped,
it's all hands on deck.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.682
What about the board?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.089
I'm a doctor, Derek.

03:08.122 --> 03:08.956
Not right now.

03:10.725 --> 03:12.727
Fine, then I will
be a good Samaritan

03:12.760 --> 03:15.528
and I will triage
patients on the street.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.765
First respondents already
have enough to deal with.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.801
What if I just grabbed
a gun and ran outside

03:20.835 --> 03:21.702
to assist the police?

03:21.736 --> 03:23.070
But the victims-

03:23.104 --> 03:25.106
- They have other
people to help them.

03:25.139 --> 03:26.707
You broke the rules, Al.

03:26.741 --> 03:28.175
Getting benched
is a consequence.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.577
I know, I get it.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.481
I really do, but it's wrong.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.549
I mean, I can save lives.

03:37.919 --> 03:39.921
All I did was save a life.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.023
I know.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.796
You'll be back in action for

03:48.829 --> 03:50.197
the next mass
shooting, I promise.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.565
That is not funny.

03:57.038 --> 03:58.638
Ali?

03:58.672 --> 03:59.673
Jess?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.508
Thank God.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.912
I'm here and the door's
closed behind me.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.749
Really? Overprotective much?

04:09.951 --> 04:11.484
Say hello to my wife.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.486
Hi, Stella.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.991
See? She's here and
Derek's here, and I'm okay.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.826
Just you go to your
briefing, be careful,

04:18.859 --> 04:21.028
and call me when you can.

04:21.062 --> 04:21.896
Love you.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.765
Stella got called up
and she's being paranoid

04:24.799 --> 04:28.668
and she doesn't want me to
be alone, so sleep over?

04:28.703 --> 04:30.137
Sure.

04:30.171 --> 04:32.672
Governor's mobilizing
the National Guard.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.108
Sounds like a good call.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.710
I don't know, seems
like overkill to me.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.644
Yeah, I thought so
too, but Stella said

04:37.677 --> 04:40.647
what's happening is worse
than what they're letting on.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.817
I knew it, I felt it.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.819
Shit!

04:55.562 --> 04:56.696
Shit.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.690
The Center for Disease
Control has been rocked

05:23.724 --> 05:25.658
by a massive explosion.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.329
The blast was felt more
than 20 blocks away

05:28.362 --> 05:31.832
and big dark smoke is
now rising into the air.

05:31.866 --> 05:33.734
No word yet on whether the blast

05:33.768 --> 05:35.836
has reached any of the
numerous laboratories

05:35.870 --> 05:38.039
or hazardous containment
units inside,

05:38.072 --> 05:39.707
but the damage to
the structure is said

05:39.740 --> 05:41.342
- to be devastating-
- I gotta get down there.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.676
Are you insane? We just
had this conversation.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.812
Things are different now!

05:44.845 --> 05:46.679
Yeah, it's a lot worse.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.083
Running into death isn't
always the best choice, Ali.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.252
It's the right
thing to do, Derek.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.254
Right isn't better than smart.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.056
Guys, are you seeing this?

05:55.089 --> 05:56.891
In what appears to be an
extremely well coordinated

05:56.924 --> 05:59.760
terror attack, the greatest
cities across the nation,

05:59.794 --> 06:02.695
and now around the world,
have all come under fire

06:02.730 --> 06:04.597
within moments of each other.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.801
Social media sites are
crashing under the weight

06:06.834 --> 06:09.203
of the cell phone footage
documenting attacks

06:09.236 --> 06:12.605
in New York, Chicago,
Paris, London, Berlin,

06:12.639 --> 06:14.842
Cairo, and a dozen other cities.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.777
Including here Atlanta.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.645
More breaking news now.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.980
The Atlanta Police
Department has issued

06:20.014 --> 06:21.816
the following
statement via Twitter:

06:21.849 --> 06:25.953
"CDC compromised, immediate
quarantine of surrounding area.

06:25.986 --> 06:30.991
Details to follow."

06:31.892 --> 06:33.626
This is nuts, there's
too much gunfire.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.261
Can't tell the good
guys from the bad.

06:34.295 --> 06:36.030
It's Stella.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.664
"Situation's critical,
evacuate now someplace safe.

06:37.697 --> 06:38.899
Find you when it's over."

06:38.933 --> 06:39.767
Two minutes.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.369
Grab what you can.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.704
I know a place we can go.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.674
Back to
Emory now as the chaos expands

06:47.708 --> 06:50.744
from the site of the
nearby CDC explosion.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.611
There are...

07:14.235 --> 07:15.803
We should take
the access road.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.705
It'll get us to
the freeway faster.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.074
Police presence might make
it safe for the larger roads.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.144
- Or not!
- Let's go!

07:29.416 --> 07:31.318
In a
statement released moments ago,

07:31.352 --> 07:33.420
representatives from the
Atlanta mayor's office

07:33.454 --> 07:36.223
have confirmed more
than 300 deaths

07:36.257 --> 07:38.292
and well over a
thousand casualties

07:38.325 --> 07:40.027
on the Emory campus alone.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.397
Hazardous material teams
have begun entering

07:43.430 --> 07:45.332
the Center for Disease Control,

07:45.366 --> 07:48.802
gathering bodies and debris
for identification and testing.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.939
The president has said
that while Martial Law

07:51.972 --> 07:55.176
is not in effect, they
will be deploying soldiers

07:55.209 --> 07:58.712
and marines to several affected
cities across the nation.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.247
I'm still not
getting anything.

08:00.281 --> 08:01.815
The network damage
must be massive.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.952
Might've targeted cell towers.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.254
Maybe farther
outside of the city?

08:07.288 --> 08:09.390
Rural towers could still be up.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.825
I need to let
Stella know I'm safe.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.127
I know she's worried about me.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.429
Trust me, she's
busy right now.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.301
What he means is,
Stella sent you to us

08:20.334 --> 08:21.835
because she knew we
would do everything

08:21.869 --> 08:24.004
we could to keep
each other safe.

08:24.038 --> 08:27.074
She's going to assume the best
until she hears otherwise,

08:27.107 --> 08:30.010
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.383
The Federal
Aviation Administration

08:36.417 --> 08:38.219
has reported that all
commercial flights

08:38.252 --> 08:39.954
are on the ground
and accounted for,

08:39.987 --> 08:42.489
and all commercial air
travel is suspended.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.491
Across the country,
police departments

08:44.525 --> 08:46.994
have instituted curfews,
some to take effect

08:47.027 --> 08:48.495
as early as sundown.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.497
And with multiple
terrorist organizations

08:50.531 --> 08:53.200
claiming responsibility
for this worldwide tragedy

08:53.234 --> 08:55.803
and promising more bloodshed
in the coming days,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.037
fear is rising.

09:05.512 --> 09:09.283
Hey, maybe give it
a rest for awhile?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.317
We should be
getting something.

09:10.351 --> 09:11.919
We're not that far out.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.354
There's gonna be
a warehouse up here

09:13.387 --> 09:14.888
on the left in a bit.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.490
We can stop to get
some more supplies

09:16.523 --> 09:18.392
and I'll drive from there
and it'll just be easier.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.994
More supplies?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.762
How long are you
planning on being here?

09:22.731 --> 09:26.066
It's not about length of
stay, Jess, it's about comfort.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.370
I mean, why rough it if
we don't have to, right?

09:37.945 --> 09:40.047
Is anyone even here?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.117
None of the windows are
broken, doors look secure.

09:44.051 --> 09:44.918
Harry's here.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.056
And if I'm right, this
parking lot is pretty much

09:49.089 --> 09:50.924
the safest place in
the country right now.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.926
And if you're wrong?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.963
Just drive slowly
and follow my lead.

10:22.156 --> 10:24.558
You dumbfucks
just won't learn, will ya?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.593
Get the fuck off my
property or I swear to God

10:26.627 --> 10:28.195
- I'm gonna riddle you-
- Harry!

10:28.228 --> 10:29.496
With so many goddamn
holes swiss cheese

10:29.530 --> 10:31.031
- is gonna be jealous.
- Hey, Harry!

10:31.065 --> 10:32.299
What?

10:32.333 --> 10:34.468
It's Alison Olsen.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.969
Tom's girl?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.005
Yes, sir!

10:38.038 --> 10:40.074
Little Alison?

10:40.107 --> 10:40.974
Yes, sir!

10:42.142 --> 10:43.644
Oh shit.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.280
Your dipshit fucktard
numbnut brother with ya?

10:47.214 --> 10:48.582
No, sir, he's not.

10:48.615 --> 10:52.086
It's just my friend
Jessi and my fiance.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.888
He's Army.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.656
Army?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.424
Fucking hell, Alison.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.093
Hoped you'd learn from
your mama's mistake

10:59.126 --> 11:01.362
and know better than to
marry a goddamn soldier.

11:02.563 --> 11:04.164
Well, we haven't
said I do yet,

11:04.198 --> 11:07.067
so there's still time
for me to wise up.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.001
You open?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.603
Only for family.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.572
Come on in, quick, quick,
quick, let's go, let's go.

11:13.140 --> 11:13.974
Hustle, Army.

11:19.213 --> 11:21.014
Sorry to meet under
these circumstances.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.118
Last I heard, you
were in Atlanta.

11:24.151 --> 11:24.952
Yes, Sir.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.587
Shit.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.956
It sounds like the CDC was
one hellacious clusterfuck.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.458
Glad you all are okay.

11:31.492 --> 11:35.996
So, welcome to my palace.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.030
I hope you're not OCD.

11:38.399 --> 11:39.933
What do ya think?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.402
We could use some help, Harry.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.537
Shit, you kidding me?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.339
Your daddy would kick
my ass if he were here

11:45.372 --> 11:47.274
and I turned you away.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.175
Whatever you need.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.145
Damn good man, your daddy.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.279
Even if he was Army.

11:53.715 --> 11:56.183
What you got against Army?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.352
What I got against Army?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.120
You know what Army stands for?

12:00.154 --> 12:03.223
Ain't Ready For Marines Yet.

12:03.257 --> 12:04.658
Semper Fidelis, son.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.394
Why don't you get
soldier boy here a tshirt

12:07.428 --> 12:08.228
that's lying around.

12:08.262 --> 12:09.731
On the house.

12:09.764 --> 12:10.564
Hoorah!

12:14.134 --> 12:15.169
He's a laugh riot.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.503
- Hey, Harry!
- Yo!

12:16.537 --> 12:18.305
You still keep the
candy in the same place?

12:18.338 --> 12:20.507
Oh yeah, plenty
of candy in the candy jar.

12:20.541 --> 12:22.609
Whatever you need, take double.

12:23.778 --> 12:24.611
There's candy?

12:36.690 --> 12:39.359
It looks like the
NRA threw up in here.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.401
Hey, Al?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.368
Yeah?

12:48.402 --> 12:49.403
Just in case?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.305
Just in case.

12:56.310 --> 12:57.611
Hey, Harry, thanks
for everything.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.146
We really appreciate it.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.048
Yeah.

13:01.081 --> 13:01.749
You going out to your daddy's
spot and wait this shit out?

13:01.783 --> 13:02.784
That's the plan.

13:02.817 --> 13:04.418
You should come with us.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
Nah, thanks.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.121
This is my place.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.258
We might have a
little trouble getting

13:11.291 --> 13:13.293
the three of you out of here.

13:13.327 --> 13:15.062
What's up?

13:15.095 --> 13:17.197
When all this shit started
a few mouth-breathing

13:17.231 --> 13:19.166
good old boys thought
they'd come take

13:19.199 --> 13:21.736
what they wanted so
they could play war

13:21.769 --> 13:24.706
and I disabused them of
that notion right quick.

13:24.739 --> 13:26.573
But now they're back.

13:26.607 --> 13:28.575
And my guess is they
were waiting for dark,

13:28.609 --> 13:31.645
but got perturbed
when you gained entry.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.214
They think you're taking
all the good toys.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.649
Think they'll
listen to reason?

13:35.682 --> 13:36.550
I do not.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.285
I know these boys.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.588
They are big and mean and
dumb as a box of hair.

13:41.622 --> 13:43.257
And most of 'em can't
shoot for fucking shit,

13:43.290 --> 13:45.492
but if they start they're
gonna spray around

13:45.526 --> 13:48.763
enough lead to hit something,
so we are gonna have

13:48.796 --> 13:50.497
to lay down some
presser fire to keep

13:50.531 --> 13:53.200
them tucked back while
Army here loads the truck.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.203
Hey.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.505
You handle the cover fire, I'll
get the stuff to the truck.

13:58.539 --> 14:00.674
I'm just as fast as you
are for short distances.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.710
I'm stronger, some of
that gear is really heavy-

14:02.744 --> 14:04.278
- Hey kids, we don't have time
for political discussions.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.847
Somebody take the rifle,
somebody grab the car.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.714
Let's go.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.283
Okay.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.185
There we go.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.688
Cover fire only, Harry.

14:14.722 --> 14:15.656
No causalities?

14:29.704 --> 14:32.072
On the left, Al.

14:42.683 --> 14:44.251
Let's go, let's go!

14:45.686 --> 14:47.087
Come on, Jess.

14:52.693 --> 14:54.294
Stay low!

14:56.496 --> 14:57.331
Jessi!

14:58.866 --> 15:00.300
Derek, help me!

15:00.334 --> 15:01.535
Come on up.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.337
Come on up.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.138
Get her in the car,
get her in the car.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.673
Go go go!

15:17.250 --> 15:17.885
Harry!

15:29.396 --> 15:30.464
Oh god, oh!

15:47.314 --> 15:48.682
Oh god.

15:48.716 --> 15:50.183
How's she doing?

15:50.217 --> 15:51.819
Jess, I know
this is gonna hurt,

15:51.853 --> 15:52.920
but I gotta get in there and
see what's going on, okay?

15:52.954 --> 15:55.455
Ali, I'm pregnant, 14 weeks.

15:58.726 --> 16:00.928
Well, thank god you told me.

16:00.962 --> 16:03.731
I thought you were
just getting fat.

16:03.765 --> 16:08.770
You are an evil bitch
and no one likes you.

16:09.737 --> 16:11.371
Okay, okay, okay, just
breathe, just breathe.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.239
I got you both.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.542
Okay, all right.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.713
Okay, okay.

16:18.746 --> 16:20.180
All right, okay.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.383
Bullet went straight through.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.585
I don't feel any
chipped or broken bones.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.555
That's good.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.556
I don't like this
bleeding though.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.427
I can't close it up until I
know what's going on in there.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.762
You?

16:34.796 --> 16:36.630
We need to take her
to the hospital.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.331
Nearest one's about an hour
in the opposite direction.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.734
Property's closer, head there.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.535
Done.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.937
This is your pregnant
friend with a bullet wound.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.006
Anything that I would
need is in that EMT kit.

16:45.039 --> 16:47.674
I just need a flat surface
and some room to work.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.443
What about x-rays, cat scan?

16:49.476 --> 16:51.311
- You got that in your bag?
- Derek!

16:51.344 --> 16:53.380
Stop telling the trauma
doc what her patient needs.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.982
I'm just trying to
save the trauma doctor

16:55.016 --> 16:56.416
from repeating the same mistake.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.952
What about the baby?

16:57.985 --> 17:00.587
There's no
guarantee either way.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.956
But there's no
doctor in the world

17:01.989 --> 17:04.458
who will love this
baby more than I do.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.793
I am her godmother after all.

17:06.961 --> 17:08.361
Oh, are you?

17:09.463 --> 17:10.932
I am now.

17:10.965 --> 17:13.835
Go!

17:25.913 --> 17:27.647
Harry, grab the kit and make
sure the table's cleared off.

17:27.681 --> 17:29.249
The trailer should be open.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.357
What the?

17:39.593 --> 17:40.728
Is somebody here?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.917
Leave us alone and
tell Marcus to fuck off!

18:05.385 --> 18:06.553
Stealing my property!

18:07.722 --> 18:08.990
Kevin!

18:09.023 --> 18:10.457
What the fuck are
you doing here?

18:12.960 --> 18:13.961
Focus!

18:13.995 --> 18:15.029
Who is in the trailer?

18:15.062 --> 18:16.831
Uh, it's Hanna, she's my girl-

18:16.864 --> 18:17.865
- Get her out!

18:17.899 --> 18:19.100
I need that trailer now.

18:19.133 --> 18:21.002
Get her out!

18:21.035 --> 18:22.569
Are you okay?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.337
I'm fine.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.774
Jesus Christ, Harry.

18:26.808 --> 18:28.341
Hanna?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.544
God damn it, Kevin.
Get her out now!

18:30.577 --> 18:31.879
- Okay, it's-
- Now!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.582
It's my sister and
her friend, okay?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.919
Hanna, baby, don't shoot.

18:37.952 --> 18:40.487
Hanna, don't shoot.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.036
Okay, bring her in.

18:55.069 --> 18:56.469
I need you guys outta
the way, outta the way.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.605
Kevin, hand me that towel!

18:59.606 --> 19:00.875
Kevin, get them, okay?

19:00.908 --> 19:02.777
Here you go. Okay,
okay, thank you.

19:02.810 --> 19:04.611
Kevin, give me the med kit.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.914
It didn't look like a girl
when I pulled the trigger.

19:06.948 --> 19:09.717
- Is she okay?
- You're okay, you're okay.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.953
- Here.
- Thank you.

19:11.986 --> 19:15.089
- I'm so sorry-
- Get her out of here!

19:15.122 --> 19:16.656
- Okay, you're okay.
- Okay, okay,

19:16.690 --> 19:18.658
- we're gonna go outside.
- Okay, okay.

19:18.692 --> 19:19.559
There we go.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.494
Yeah, we're good.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.135
Please don't say we shoulda
gone to the hospital.

19:28.169 --> 19:30.503
I was only gonna
ask how I could help.

19:31.739 --> 19:33.540
I think I got this now.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.507
How's your arm?

19:35.810 --> 19:38.511
No gushers, just a
couple of stitches maybe.

19:39.347 --> 19:41.615
I'll feel better once I
kick your brother's ass.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.118
Yeah, I'd do it
myself if I wasn't

19:44.151 --> 19:46.053
a little busy right now.

19:46.087 --> 19:47.554
She'll be okay, Al.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.123
We all will.

19:49.156 --> 19:49.991
Harry won't.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.919
I covered
your friend up.

20:17.952 --> 20:19.086
The blood was
freaking Hanna out.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.656
Hey man, I'm really
sorry about your arm.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.659
Oh.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.728
That's for this.

20:29.797 --> 20:30.731
Guess we're even.

20:30.765 --> 20:31.766
I didn't say that.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.869
This place is a mess.

20:37.705 --> 20:39.539
How long have you
been squatting here?

20:39.572 --> 20:42.009
I wouldn't call staying
at a family place squatting.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.512
A little over a month.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.181
I'm not using, Ali, I'm clean.

20:47.214 --> 20:49.083
I thought this would be a
nice quiet place to focus on-

20:49.116 --> 20:51.218
- I can see what you've
been focusing on.

20:51.252 --> 20:52.585
Great, here we go.

20:53.988 --> 20:55.655
Look, if you are
actually clean this time,

20:55.689 --> 20:57.124
then I am happy for you,

20:57.158 --> 20:59.026
but you are not supposed
to be here, Kevin.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.560
Yeah, well you
can't keep me from-

21:00.593 --> 21:03.097
- Your girlfriend
just killed a man.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.833
- That was an accident!
- Hey, Hanna.

21:05.866 --> 21:06.901
Just stay outta this.

21:06.934 --> 21:07.735
It's okay, I got it handled.

21:07.768 --> 21:08.836
Shit.

21:08.869 --> 21:09.704
Did I do that?

21:11.072 --> 21:13.673
You told me to point
the gun at the door.

21:13.708 --> 21:16.576
You told me to shoot him
and they were gonna kill us.

21:17.912 --> 21:19.113
This isn't your fault.

21:20.014 --> 21:23.017
Can you find a
safe place for Harry?

21:23.050 --> 21:24.617
Yeah.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.618
Thank you.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.888
What about my face?

21:39.800 --> 21:42.737
You and I got
off to a bad start.

21:45.339 --> 21:46.573
I'd like to fix that.

21:48.709 --> 21:49.509
I'm Alison.

21:50.711 --> 21:51.746
Hanna.

21:51.779 --> 21:53.546
It's nice to meet you, Hanna.

21:53.580 --> 21:57.650
Um, are any of your
teeth feeling loose?

21:57.684 --> 21:58.753
Can you move your jaw?

22:01.822 --> 22:02.655
That's good. Okay.

22:10.264 --> 22:11.098
May I?

22:16.871 --> 22:18.706
This is gonna sting, I'm sorry.

22:21.976 --> 22:22.810
Okay.

22:23.778 --> 22:26.013
It's gonna be sore for
a few days and you need

22:26.047 --> 22:27.181
to keep it clean, okay?

22:30.284 --> 22:33.220
I'm sorry that I
elbowed you in the face.

22:34.822 --> 22:38.859
I'm really sorry
I killed your friend.

22:39.794 --> 22:41.228
Hanna.

22:41.262 --> 22:43.164
I really did, I wish
Kevin had never given

22:43.197 --> 22:47.667
- me that stupid fucking gun.
- Hanna, Hanna, Hanna.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.636
You're hyperventilating, okay?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.872
Listen, you're gonna
be fine, but I just,

22:51.906 --> 22:53.140
I need you to breathe
with me, okay?

22:53.174 --> 22:54.341
Slow it down.

22:55.376 --> 22:57.011
- I killed your friend
- Hanna!

22:57.044 --> 22:58.379
And you're being so
fucking nice to me.

22:58.412 --> 22:59.814
Listen, we don't blame you.

22:59.847 --> 23:02.116
I know that it was an accident.

23:02.149 --> 23:03.884
It wasn't your fault.

23:03.918 --> 23:04.752
Okay?

23:05.986 --> 23:07.288
It really wasn't.

23:07.321 --> 23:11.125
I don't
wanna go to jail.

23:11.158 --> 23:13.060
Hanna, listen.

23:13.094 --> 23:15.129
Don't worry about
that right now, okay?

23:15.162 --> 23:19.166
The police have bigger things
to deal with, trust me.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.670
And when this is all over,
Derek and I will go down

23:23.704 --> 23:24.738
to the police station with you

23:24.772 --> 23:26.340
and we will explain everything.

23:26.373 --> 23:28.809
You won't face
any charges, okay?

23:28.843 --> 23:29.676
You will?

23:30.878 --> 23:32.046
We will.

23:32.079 --> 23:33.047
You promise?

23:33.080 --> 23:33.948
I promise.

23:36.283 --> 23:37.151
Thank you.

24:02.843 --> 24:03.878
Horse shit.

24:05.346 --> 24:07.281
I don't care if you
believe it or not.

24:07.314 --> 24:08.282
It's the truth.

24:09.450 --> 24:10.918
Even the radio?

24:10.951 --> 24:12.786
Nothing on any station.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.723
All that means is you
have a shitty radio.

24:15.756 --> 24:17.358
The cell service is down too.

24:17.391 --> 24:19.894
That doesn't mean dick,
it's always spotty out here.

24:24.798 --> 24:25.799
Grab that.

24:26.734 --> 24:28.169
Maybe we can use it.

25:52.519 --> 25:54.355
- Sorry.
- Ow, why do you hate me?

25:57.057 --> 25:57.992
Hey, you.

25:58.025 --> 25:59.059
How ya feeling?

25:59.093 --> 26:01.929
Like I got punched by a rhino.

26:01.962 --> 26:03.097
You're just gonna
be sore for awhile,

26:03.130 --> 26:04.898
but no permanent damage.

26:04.932 --> 26:06.033
What about the baby?

26:08.335 --> 26:10.104
It's too soon to tell, Jess.

26:10.137 --> 26:13.907
I'll know more in 24 hours,
but I'm really hopeful.

26:17.378 --> 26:18.946
I walked some
of the perimeter.

26:18.979 --> 26:21.415
This is a smart spot;
secluded, remote,

26:22.583 --> 26:24.885
one way in and out,
clear sight lines.

26:26.053 --> 26:27.087
I'll have a better
sense tomorrow,

26:27.121 --> 26:28.422
but we could secure this place.

26:29.290 --> 26:30.591
Good call.

26:30.624 --> 26:32.092
The minute Jess
got Stella's text

26:32.126 --> 26:33.927
it just popped into my head.

26:35.162 --> 26:37.531
It's always felt
like a safe haven.

26:39.967 --> 26:40.901
Until tonight.

26:44.104 --> 26:44.938
Where's Kevin?

26:48.042 --> 26:49.410
Hey there, Red.

26:49.443 --> 26:50.978
How ya feeling?

26:51.011 --> 26:51.979
Nauseated.

26:55.349 --> 26:57.051
Is that everything?

26:57.084 --> 26:58.052
Yeah, I think so.

27:00.087 --> 27:02.456
I can't believe
dad still had this thing.

27:02.489 --> 27:03.624
Does it work?

27:03.657 --> 27:05.092
Maybe.

27:05.125 --> 27:05.959
We need it to.

27:06.894 --> 27:09.363
Who knows when cell
service will be back up.

27:09.396 --> 27:10.864
It's our best chance
of staying safe

27:10.898 --> 27:12.499
until the cavalry arrives.

27:12.533 --> 27:13.901
It's not the cavalry.

27:14.868 --> 27:18.105
Mark my words, kung fu
grip, if this thing's real,

27:18.138 --> 27:19.873
the government's behind it.

27:19.907 --> 27:21.108
You mark my words.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.010
You call me kung fu grip again,

27:23.043 --> 27:25.112
I'll make sure this time
you swallow your teeth.

27:25.145 --> 27:25.979
Ha!

27:28.148 --> 27:29.450
I can see why you like him, Ali.

27:30.384 --> 27:33.187
These Heathkit units
are pretty sturdy.

27:33.220 --> 27:35.389
Probably just needs
a good cleaning

27:35.422 --> 27:37.057
and a couple of tubes replaced.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.260
If you can find some of
the parts out in the shed

27:40.294 --> 27:42.062
I should have this up and
running in a few minutes.

27:42.096 --> 27:44.164
All I need is a Philip's
head screwdriver.

27:44.198 --> 27:47.034
Oh, and to not be shot.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.001
Hey, you know what?

27:48.869 --> 27:51.138
It's late, you can
work on this tomorrow.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.473
You don't need to push it.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.275
Doctor's orders.

27:55.309 --> 27:58.379
My doctor and the
toxic masculinity twins

27:58.412 --> 27:59.646
can get out of my hair.

28:01.081 --> 28:03.050
You can be my hands.

28:03.083 --> 28:03.884
I'll help.

28:09.123 --> 28:10.391
I'm not leaving.

28:10.424 --> 28:13.594
You can stay,
but no doctoring.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.503
Good, now disconnect that wire.

28:25.005 --> 28:27.541
So, you're married to a girl?

28:29.343 --> 28:30.177
Stella.

28:31.245 --> 28:32.045
These are next.

28:33.580 --> 28:37.184
You know, I identify
as bi-curious.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.553
I marched in Pride twice.

28:39.586 --> 28:41.188
You know, I chose you
to help me with this

28:41.221 --> 28:43.390
because I thought you
were the quiet one.

28:43.424 --> 28:46.193
Look, I'm not trying to be
your best friend or anything,

28:46.226 --> 28:48.128
but I just had the
worst day of my life

28:48.162 --> 28:50.397
and I work better
with background noise.

28:50.431 --> 28:51.932
So, how did you guys meet?

28:53.567 --> 28:55.936
It's so mundane.

28:57.638 --> 29:01.542
Coffee shop. Barista
got our orders confused.

29:03.177 --> 29:07.381
She took one sip and spit
it out all over herself.

29:09.283 --> 29:12.252
Oh, be sure to clean that or
it's gonna give us trouble.

29:12.286 --> 29:13.721
- There.
- Yeah, I see it.

29:16.356 --> 29:18.125
Oh, what next?

29:18.158 --> 29:20.093
Oh, then just reconnect
everything and we're done.

29:20.127 --> 29:22.463
No, I mean with Stella.

29:22.496 --> 29:23.330
Oh.

29:24.498 --> 29:27.034
I offered to pay for
her dry cleaning.

29:27.067 --> 29:30.103
She said, "Take me
to dinner instead."

29:31.271 --> 29:33.474
I told her she
seriously overestimated

29:33.507 --> 29:35.108
the worth of her shirt.

29:36.477 --> 29:39.112
She laughed, I laughed.

29:40.347 --> 29:41.515
That was six years ago.

29:42.649 --> 29:44.184
We've been together ever since.

29:45.385 --> 29:48.088
Never did get that
shirt cleaned.

29:49.389 --> 29:51.191
Stella had it
framed and gave it

29:51.225 --> 29:53.093
to her as a wedding present.

29:53.126 --> 29:53.761
Really?

29:55.562 --> 30:00.067
That sounds like one of
those documentary stories.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.201
I think it's really sweet.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.306
I think we're done.

30:06.340 --> 30:07.207
Oh, flip it.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.157
You can try again
in the morning.

30:24.191 --> 30:25.359
Work, you piece of shit!

30:30.497 --> 30:33.333
Woo!

30:33.367 --> 30:34.167
Good work.

30:35.168 --> 30:37.404
I'm gonna pass out now.

30:41.642 --> 30:42.442
Oh.

30:44.812 --> 30:46.580
The last
hour has seen another wave

30:46.613 --> 30:48.716
of explosions leaving
tens of thousands

30:48.750 --> 30:51.184
of victims dead
across the globe.

30:51.218 --> 30:53.287
The causalities are rising
here at home as well.

30:53.320 --> 30:54.856
That's enough, shut it off.

30:54.889 --> 30:56.557
The National
Guard has been called up

30:56.590 --> 30:57.825
in all 50 states, and
they are attempting to-

30:59.393 --> 31:01.061
I can't
believe it's real.

31:03.765 --> 31:06.233
We barely made
it out of Atlanta.

31:06.266 --> 31:08.302
Jessi got shot.

31:08.335 --> 31:10.838
Trust me, it's real.

31:10.872 --> 31:12.740
Well, you're safe here now.

31:12.774 --> 31:15.208
We'll be out of your
hair in the morning.

31:15.242 --> 31:17.779
- Kev, we can all-
- No, it's fine.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.681
I'm used to it.

31:20.715 --> 31:23.250
I'll find somewhere
else to squat.

31:23.283 --> 31:24.819
Come on, Hanna,
we'll stay outside.

31:33.694 --> 31:34.762
What's his problem?

31:37.431 --> 31:38.632
Kevin was always trouble,

31:38.665 --> 31:40.500
but he got worse after Mom died.

31:41.602 --> 31:43.570
Drugs, alcohol.

31:45.272 --> 31:47.809
When he was 18 he got
arrested for petty larceny.

31:49.543 --> 31:50.611
Dad had enough.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.482
Didn't bail him out, wouldn't
let him back in the house.

31:56.751 --> 31:58.552
Kevin didn't take that too well.

32:01.555 --> 32:03.457
I know we left the
city to get away from

32:04.726 --> 32:09.229
stupid dangerous
people, but I can't kick

32:10.430 --> 32:13.600
my own brother out
into whatever the hell

32:13.634 --> 32:15.335
is going on out there.

32:17.404 --> 32:18.238
Can I?

32:47.367 --> 32:48.301
Hey.

32:49.403 --> 32:50.504
You been up all night?

32:51.438 --> 32:53.573
They took some food and water.

32:53.607 --> 32:56.677
Blankets, a few
flares, and a shotgun.

32:59.747 --> 33:01.214
Thought he was bluffing.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.318
Should we try and
bring him back?

33:05.352 --> 33:06.954
Can't force them to stay, Al.

33:08.388 --> 33:09.891
Think they're gonna be okay?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.862
Do we really care?

33:39.386 --> 33:40.620
I think we should go back.

33:42.023 --> 33:45.292
If what they said on the
radio's true, we'd be safer.

33:45.325 --> 33:46.493
No, Hanna, we're not.

33:47.929 --> 33:50.430
My sister and I, we don't
get along the best of days.

33:50.464 --> 33:53.366
And you, you did
kill her friend.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.638
Well, she knows
that wasn't on purpose

33:58.672 --> 34:00.273
and she promised
she'd tell the police

34:00.307 --> 34:02.409
when we got back that
it was an accident.

34:02.442 --> 34:04.879
That's what she said when
she thought she needed you.

34:04.912 --> 34:05.980
What is she really
gonna say when

34:06.013 --> 34:07.447
she gets back to civilization?

34:09.083 --> 34:11.418
You don't trust
your own sister?

34:11.451 --> 34:13.487
We haven't been
family for a long time.

34:15.555 --> 34:16.858
Family shouldn't kick you out.

34:18.525 --> 34:21.528
Well, they didn't
kick us out, we left.

34:21.561 --> 34:22.395
We could go back.

34:23.363 --> 34:28.435
You're my family,
and us going back there

34:28.468 --> 34:30.570
isn't safe for us, Hannabear.

34:30.604 --> 34:33.975
I'm worried about you.

34:34.008 --> 34:35.575
You only call me
Hannabear when you want

34:35.609 --> 34:36.510
me to do something.

34:38.378 --> 34:40.514
We're gonna be fine, trust me.

34:40.547 --> 34:45.418
I have it covered.

34:53.761 --> 34:55.328
You doing okay in there?

34:59.633 --> 35:02.870
Morning sickness is
hell with a gunshot wound.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.440
Did your stitches hold?

35:07.474 --> 35:09.844
Just really sore.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.855
You're still feverish.

35:20.888 --> 35:22.924
You really should lie down.

35:22.957 --> 35:24.591
The nausea's worse
when I lie down.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.861
This is gonna give me
something to focus on

35:26.894 --> 35:28.830
other than my
rollercoaster stomach

35:28.863 --> 35:30.731
and the hole in my upper torso.

35:30.765 --> 35:32.967
Ali, this sling
is really fucking-

35:33.000 --> 35:34.836
- Okay.
- Uncomfortable, god.

35:34.869 --> 35:36.570
You are seriously
the worst patient

35:36.603 --> 35:38.405
I have ever had,
do you know that?

35:38.438 --> 35:39.841
You love it.

35:39.874 --> 35:41.374
All right, listen to me.

35:41.408 --> 35:42.676
If you're not gonna
wear your sling,

35:42.710 --> 35:44.477
I need you to keep
that arm still.

35:44.511 --> 35:45.645
And if you're not
gonna lie down,

35:45.679 --> 35:46.848
I need you to take it easy.

35:46.881 --> 35:47.915
Got it?

35:47.949 --> 35:49.083
Yes, doctor.

35:49.116 --> 35:51.551
I'm gonna go check on Derek.

35:51.585 --> 35:53.453
You call me if
you need anything.

36:00.761 --> 36:03.463
I just need
to talk to my wife.

36:11.739 --> 36:13.808
Well, we could go
talk to her and I'm sure

36:13.841 --> 36:14.775
- she would be fine with-
- No, Hanna,

36:14.809 --> 36:15.776
we're not going back.

36:15.810 --> 36:16.744
But we could.

36:16.777 --> 36:17.712
No, Hanna, damn it.

36:17.745 --> 36:19.180
You don't understand.

36:19.213 --> 36:20.882
All right, Ali, she
just abandoned me.

36:20.915 --> 36:23.516
My dad, he...

36:24.852 --> 36:26.653
You know what, you
just haven't...

36:28.588 --> 36:29.522
Hanna?

36:32.459 --> 36:33.660
Hanna, real cute.

36:34.962 --> 36:36.396
Stop playing.

36:41.736 --> 36:42.569
Hannabear?

36:46.473 --> 36:47.540
Hanna, Hanna!

36:50.677 --> 36:51.544
Hanna!

37:01.722 --> 37:02.522
No.

37:51.906 --> 37:53.874
Hey, you just getting back?

37:56.643 --> 37:58.578
You moved the SUV.

37:58.611 --> 38:00.781
In case we're forced to bolt.

38:00.815 --> 38:02.615
Loaded some emergency
supplies, too.

38:04.651 --> 38:05.485
Smart.

38:06.821 --> 38:07.620
Thank you.

38:09.256 --> 38:10.992
We need to bury Harry.

38:12.592 --> 38:14.594
I thought you might
wanna pick the spot.

38:15.595 --> 38:16.230
Right.

38:17.697 --> 38:18.631
Oh shit.

38:19.867 --> 38:21.701
I'm sorry, Al.

38:21.736 --> 38:22.535
I'm an idiot.

38:32.612 --> 38:33.546
You're wonderful.

38:34.782 --> 38:36.050
I would like that, thank you.

38:41.789 --> 38:43.858
Hey, have you slept at all?

38:46.027 --> 38:47.762
There's too much stuff to do.

38:47.795 --> 38:48.896
I'll just grab some coffee.

38:48.929 --> 38:49.764
No.

38:51.332 --> 38:54.135
You haven't rested since
this thing started.

38:54.168 --> 38:55.635
You gotta get off that leg.

38:55.668 --> 38:56.636
The longer that
you push yourself-

38:56.669 --> 38:58.039
- I know my limits, Al.

39:00.875 --> 39:02.343
I'm gonna check the perimeter.

39:02.376 --> 39:03.144
Hey.

39:04.644 --> 39:05.279
No.

39:06.781 --> 39:09.150
Look, we made a deal.

39:10.785 --> 39:15.289
When the world gets tough,
we lean on each other, okay?

39:17.758 --> 39:22.063
I just trusted you to hold me
while I wept for my friend.

39:23.864 --> 39:25.866
You can trust me to
take care of things

39:25.900 --> 39:28.701
while you take a nap, okay?

39:33.908 --> 39:34.708
Okay?

39:39.146 --> 39:40.314
What the hell?

39:42.750 --> 39:43.984
In the stars.

39:44.018 --> 39:45.786
- Black stars, dead stars.
- Christ, Kevin!

39:45.820 --> 39:46.754
What's wrong with him?

39:46.787 --> 39:47.888
Kevin!

39:47.922 --> 39:48.956
Kevin, where's Hanna?

39:48.989 --> 39:50.257
Hanna's in the lights.

39:50.291 --> 39:51.292
The lights, they
carried the lights

39:51.325 --> 39:52.993
in their eyes like stars.

39:53.027 --> 39:53.994
- Kevin, look at me!
- Black stars, dead stars.

39:54.028 --> 39:56.030
Look at me, Kevin!

39:56.063 --> 39:57.630
He's seizing, he's seizing!

39:57.664 --> 39:59.733
Get him on his side,
get him on his side.

39:59.767 --> 40:01.902
Jessi, bring me the med kit!

40:30.865 --> 40:33.134
Well, he's out of
immediate danger,

40:33.167 --> 40:34.768
but I still can't wake him.

40:35.836 --> 40:36.904
And I can't give him a stimulant

40:36.937 --> 40:38.272
because he might seize again.

40:38.305 --> 40:39.240
Did you find Hanna?

40:40.708 --> 40:42.209
No.

40:42.243 --> 40:44.044
Did a full sweep 100 yards
within the perimeter.

40:45.980 --> 40:49.083
Did Kevin say anything that
could help us get a bearing?

40:49.116 --> 40:50.451
Nothing coherent.

40:50.484 --> 40:52.685
He just keeps rambling
on and on about

40:52.720 --> 40:54.255
the lights, the lights.

40:54.288 --> 40:56.257
What do you think that is?

40:56.290 --> 40:58.792
A common visual hallucination.

40:58.826 --> 41:01.061
His pupils are constricted.

41:01.095 --> 41:02.796
I think he's high as a kite.

41:04.031 --> 41:06.400
I cannot believe I believed
him when he said he was clean.

41:06.433 --> 41:08.869
But if he's just
riding a bad trip,

41:08.903 --> 41:11.005
where'd the blood on
his hands come from?

41:11.038 --> 41:11.939
And where's Hanna?

41:13.140 --> 41:14.408
I don't know.

41:15.442 --> 41:17.845
And we've only got a couple
of hours of daylight left

41:17.878 --> 41:19.146
to try to find her.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.347
We should get going.

41:20.381 --> 41:21.949
Is that a good idea?

41:21.982 --> 41:23.751
That doesn't feel
like a good idea.

41:25.886 --> 41:27.288
I'll go alone.

41:28.489 --> 41:31.926
Jessi's still recovering,
Kevin's condition can worsen,

41:31.959 --> 41:32.993
and Hanna could stumble
out of the woods

41:33.027 --> 41:34.195
five minutes after I leave.

41:36.430 --> 41:39.033
Okay, I'll be the asshole.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.336
What if no one goes
looking for her?

41:44.038 --> 41:45.773
She seems like
basically a good kid,

41:45.806 --> 41:47.908
but we barely know her.

41:47.942 --> 41:50.477
The world's on fire and
Kevin's gone banana nut

41:50.511 --> 41:53.847
apeshit insane and we don't
know what the fuck is going on.

41:57.952 --> 41:58.953
That's exactly it.

42:00.154 --> 42:02.022
We don't know what
the fuck is going on.

42:03.857 --> 42:07.228
We have to ask ourselves, do
we wanna be the kind of people

42:07.261 --> 42:10.164
that would leave someone out
in the woods to possibly die?

42:12.900 --> 42:14.335
I don't wanna be that person.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.975
So, what's the plan?

42:21.008 --> 42:23.877
Walk until I hit the
ridge, then follow it east.

42:25.813 --> 42:28.282
If she's out here,
I'll find her.

42:30.217 --> 42:32.853
Only about as far as you can
get in an hour or so, okay?

42:32.886 --> 42:35.789
I want you back before dark.

42:35.823 --> 42:37.891
With or without Hanna.

42:38.959 --> 42:40.094
She's not worth losing you.

42:41.996 --> 42:44.098
I'll take care of myself.

42:44.131 --> 42:45.199
You do the same here.

42:51.338 --> 42:53.974
I guess sometimes right
is better than smart.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.396
Anyone broadcasting?

43:17.965 --> 43:18.932
You feel that?

43:26.340 --> 43:29.943
Feels like a happy
baby doing cartwheels.

43:31.045 --> 43:32.446
Does that mean she's okay?

43:36.984 --> 43:39.353
She's strong like her mommy.

43:40.988 --> 43:42.189
Like both her mommies.

44:28.001 --> 44:28.969
This isn't smart.

44:30.070 --> 44:31.872
Just give him a
few more minutes.

44:33.708 --> 44:35.209
If it were Stella out here,

44:35.242 --> 44:36.310
would you listen
to me if I told you

44:36.343 --> 44:38.178
to give it a few more minutes?

44:38.212 --> 44:42.149
Of course not, but I'd hope
you'd try to convince me.

44:42.182 --> 44:44.918
And for the record,
if I wasn't pregnant

44:44.952 --> 44:46.587
and nursing a gunshot wound,

44:46.620 --> 44:48.055
I'd wrestle you to
the ground and sit

44:48.088 --> 44:49.957
on you to keep you here.

44:51.392 --> 44:53.427
Instead I'll just say it
again: this isn't smart!

44:55.996 --> 44:57.398
This isn't smart.

44:58.999 --> 45:00.701
Jesus, Derek!

45:00.735 --> 45:02.403
Fuck.

45:02.436 --> 45:07.241
Oh.

45:20.654 --> 45:21.723
What were you thinking?

45:21.756 --> 45:23.190
I was looking for you.

45:24.258 --> 45:25.392
You just let her go?

45:27.194 --> 45:28.061
Hanna?

45:31.665 --> 45:34.234
Did you see
anything else weird?

45:34.268 --> 45:36.103
Any lights?

45:36.136 --> 45:38.005
No lights, just this.

45:40.307 --> 45:42.009
And an awful lot of blood.

45:46.113 --> 45:48.015
I'm gonna need some shuteye.

45:48.048 --> 45:48.982
Yeah.

45:49.016 --> 45:49.583
Can you take watch?

45:49.616 --> 45:50.718
Of course.

45:53.220 --> 45:55.155
No more than a
few hours, okay?

45:55.189 --> 45:56.089
Go.

47:39.359 --> 47:40.762
Kevin?

47:40.795 --> 47:42.195
That's where Hanna died.

47:46.801 --> 47:50.137
Kevin, can you hear me?

47:50.170 --> 47:51.438
We all saw the lights, Ali.

47:53.808 --> 47:55.242
Kevin!

48:12.292 --> 48:13.226
Come on.

48:17.164 --> 48:20.167
Tank's full of gas,
ignition sparks.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.234
Must be mechanical.

48:22.235 --> 48:24.304
I can't keep working on
this, I gotta go find Hanna.

48:24.338 --> 48:25.807
We have to fix it.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.875
Without it we don't have radio.

48:27.909 --> 48:29.242
Or clean water.

48:31.612 --> 48:32.646
Is he awake?

48:32.679 --> 48:33.748
After last night I'm not sure

48:33.781 --> 48:35.282
he's ever gonna wake up again.

48:37.384 --> 48:38.853
- That was-
- Weird as hell?

48:38.886 --> 48:40.354
Creepy as fuck?

48:40.387 --> 48:42.155
Scary as shit?

48:42.189 --> 48:43.690
I was going to say unusual,

48:43.725 --> 48:46.660
but I can't argue your point.

48:46.693 --> 48:49.162
You said lights are
a common hallucination,

48:50.130 --> 48:53.266
so does that make last
night a mass hallucination?

48:54.802 --> 48:56.403
We all saw the lights, right?

48:57.872 --> 48:59.339
Yeah.

48:59.373 --> 49:00.742
I don't have enough data to form

49:00.775 --> 49:03.276
a hypothesis about last night.

49:03.310 --> 49:05.612
Has there been anything
about lights on the radio?

49:07.280 --> 49:10.484
A lot of stuff about helicopter
lights, search lights.

49:10.517 --> 49:11.753
Maybe some weird stuff, but I-

49:14.521 --> 49:15.522
Hey, Kev.

49:16.590 --> 49:17.424
Move.

49:20.260 --> 49:21.261
Knock yourself out.

49:23.430 --> 49:24.899
How ya feeling?

49:24.932 --> 49:26.400
Fine. Why?

49:27.634 --> 49:28.702
Just didn't expect to see you

49:28.736 --> 49:31.304
up so early after last night.

49:31.338 --> 49:34.207
You feel up to working on this?

49:35.442 --> 49:37.477
Yeah, Dad used to
make me fix this thing

49:37.511 --> 49:39.312
with him when I was a kid.

49:39.346 --> 49:41.314
Remember? No worries.

49:42.649 --> 49:45.787
Yeah, I meant
because of Hanna.

49:45.820 --> 49:48.522
Who's Hanna?

49:50.725 --> 49:52.325
You don't remember Hanna?

49:58.598 --> 50:00.735
Kev, what is the last thing

50:00.768 --> 50:02.469
that you remember
from yesterday?

50:04.872 --> 50:06.640
I went for a walk,
I came back here,

50:06.673 --> 50:09.242
I went to bed, I got up.

50:11.511 --> 50:15.282
Are you having any
nausea, any blurry vision?

50:15.315 --> 50:16.784
- Can I see your-
- Ali, stop!

50:16.818 --> 50:18.218
What the fuck. I'm fine.

50:20.454 --> 50:23.390
Sorry, I'm just
worried about you.

50:24.558 --> 50:26.894
First time for
everything, right?

50:28.562 --> 50:31.331
Look, we need the power,
I can fix the generator.

50:31.364 --> 50:32.599
If you don't want me to do it,

50:32.632 --> 50:33.433
- fine.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

50:33.467 --> 50:34.367
You're right.

50:35.469 --> 50:36.403
You do what you do.

50:37.471 --> 50:39.372
We'll get outta your way.

50:51.618 --> 50:53.020
What the fuck was that?

50:53.054 --> 50:54.922
He doesn't remember
his girlfriend at all?

50:54.956 --> 50:56.924
Kevin's never dealt
well with anxiety

50:56.958 --> 50:58.291
even when he was clean.

50:59.426 --> 51:01.461
The seizures, the memory loss.

51:01.495 --> 51:03.530
Maybe it's some sort
of dissociated response

51:03.563 --> 51:05.332
to stressful stimuli.

51:05.365 --> 51:07.567
You mean like
some form of PTSD?

51:07.601 --> 51:10.303
I consider murdering my
girlfriend stressful stimuli.

51:10.337 --> 51:11.773
We don't know that
he did anything.

51:11.806 --> 51:13.640
We don't know that
he didn't either.

51:13.673 --> 51:15.743
The amount of blood
I found the other day.

51:15.777 --> 51:18.445
I can't imagine she's
still alive out there.

51:18.478 --> 51:22.415
And he's unstable at best.

51:24.551 --> 51:26.686
So, I'll keep an eye on him.

51:45.873 --> 51:48.009
Look, we've been safe
here up until now.

51:48.042 --> 51:49.977
I mean, there's literally
nothing that draws

51:50.011 --> 51:51.645
attention to this place,

51:51.678 --> 51:53.380
and the road in and
out is pretty obscured.

51:53.413 --> 51:56.616
But if you go 10 or 15
miles in either direction,

51:56.650 --> 51:58.920
it's an entirely
different story.

51:58.953 --> 52:01.621
There's reports of
militarized checkpoints,

52:01.655 --> 52:05.458
continued looting,
quarantine zones.

52:05.492 --> 52:07.929
So you're saying
things are bad. No shit.

52:07.962 --> 52:09.629
So what do we know officially?

52:10.798 --> 52:12.532
Our antenna
isn't the greatest.

52:12.566 --> 52:13.901
We're getting
everything secondhand

52:13.935 --> 52:16.369
from radio kits closest by.

52:16.403 --> 52:20.473
Sometimes late at night
when the weather cooperates,

52:20.507 --> 52:22.609
we can get something
from farther out.

52:22.642 --> 52:24.045
We're getting most
of our federal info

52:24.078 --> 52:26.379
from a guy up in
Nashville and another guy

52:26.413 --> 52:27.949
down in Central Florida.

52:27.982 --> 52:29.750
We're so close
to Fort Benning.

52:29.784 --> 52:31.384
They should be all over the air.

52:31.418 --> 52:32.920
The big bad
government's not gonna

52:32.954 --> 52:35.056
be saving your bacon this
time, knuckle dragger.

52:35.089 --> 52:37.624
Look, I don't
know why Benning's

52:37.657 --> 52:39.927
been so quiet, but in
light of any official news,

52:39.961 --> 52:42.495
the conspiracy theorists
are having a field day.

52:42.529 --> 52:44.497
Right. It's not the
terrorists, it's the aliens.

52:44.531 --> 52:46.499
Or rather it's the
terrorists acting

52:46.533 --> 52:48.903
on behalf of aliens
unleashing the virus

52:48.936 --> 52:50.738
that causes the
zombie apocalypse.

52:50.771 --> 52:52.672
Or, my personal favorite,

52:52.707 --> 52:56.177
the explosion at the CDC
opened a gateway to hell.

52:56.210 --> 52:57.011
Ah!

52:59.847 --> 53:01.816
Even Kevin's bullshit
false flag theory's

53:01.849 --> 53:03.683
getting some play.

53:03.718 --> 53:05.987
Nothing actually happened and
we're all just delusional.

53:08.956 --> 53:10.624
What about lights?

53:12.559 --> 53:13.627
You hear anything about that?

53:15.462 --> 53:19.666
I'm looking through all my
notes, searching for something,

53:20.567 --> 53:21.534
anything related to that.

53:25.706 --> 53:27.507
The fact is,
whatever is happening,

53:28.242 --> 53:30.543
it's getting worse, not better.

53:32.213 --> 53:35.049
And the shit storm outside
is closing in on us.

53:36.683 --> 53:38.418
We're not gonna be
safe here much longer.

54:03.010 --> 54:04.779
I need your help.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.633
How ya feeling?

54:28.736 --> 54:30.570
Is that why you asked me here?

54:30.603 --> 54:31.839
To play nurse for Doc Ali?

54:34.674 --> 54:37.044
Nah, but I get it.

54:38.980 --> 54:40.580
No health questions.

54:45.652 --> 54:46.553
Who's Marcus?

54:49.190 --> 54:50.623
You want my help or not?

54:51.959 --> 54:54.195
Just trying to
make conversation.

54:54.228 --> 54:55.963
Seeing he is the
reason we're here.

55:02.269 --> 55:04.238
He's a former
business associate.

55:04.271 --> 55:05.740
Next topic.

55:05.773 --> 55:07.574
Do you remember
how Harry died?

55:08.242 --> 55:09.076
Shotgun.

55:12.146 --> 55:13.646
Who shot him?

55:13.680 --> 55:14.514
I, uh...

55:20.187 --> 55:21.022
I did.

55:22.823 --> 55:23.656
Next topic.

55:26.227 --> 55:28.195
Thanks for fixing
that generator.

55:28.229 --> 55:29.263
No worries.

55:32.900 --> 55:35.102
Where'd you get those parts?

55:35.136 --> 55:37.705
Couldn't find any
of them in the shed.

55:37.738 --> 55:39.606
What's with this
interrogation?

55:40.841 --> 55:42.243
You accusing me of something?

55:42.276 --> 55:44.145
Tried to crank my
SUV this morning,

55:46.881 --> 55:49.216
found a couple parts
missing under the hood.

55:49.250 --> 55:51.684
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, dude.

55:53.387 --> 55:54.288
Don't lie to me.

55:55.723 --> 55:56.757
And don't try to play this off

55:56.791 --> 55:57.958
with your lost memory bullshit.

55:57.992 --> 55:59.760
You stripped my SUV.

56:01.862 --> 56:03.164
You need to cut
back on your Ritalin.

56:03.197 --> 56:04.631
It's making you paranoid.

56:06.100 --> 56:09.036
I see you and I know
exactly what you are.

56:16.310 --> 56:18.712
That's a choice you
don't wanna make, Kevin.

56:18.746 --> 56:19.579
Trust me.

56:25.853 --> 56:27.388
Fuck you, asshole.

56:31.892 --> 56:33.894
You better pray you can
put my ride back together

56:33.928 --> 56:34.962
when it's time to leave.

56:39.100 --> 56:40.835
Yeah, keep walking, douchebag.

57:24.278 --> 57:26.780
Whoa,
Ali, don't shoot.

57:26.814 --> 57:29.283
Jesus Christ, Kevin, you
scared the shit outta me.

57:29.316 --> 57:30.784
Sorry.

57:32.820 --> 57:34.121
I'm sick of eating MRAs.

57:35.256 --> 57:36.257
You wanna come with?

57:38.359 --> 57:39.927
Yeah.

57:46.367 --> 57:47.801
I guess that one's gone.

57:49.303 --> 57:50.137
Sorry.

58:09.857 --> 58:11.192
If you're not gonna
but me with a bunch

58:11.225 --> 58:12.393
of medical questions,
why'd you ask me

58:12.426 --> 58:14.195
to come out here with you?

58:14.228 --> 58:16.397
You know these woods
almost as well as I do.

58:17.264 --> 58:19.166
Plus, you were
always a better shot.

58:20.301 --> 58:21.135
You're lying.

58:26.073 --> 58:26.907
Okay.

58:30.945 --> 58:32.846
I wanted us to have
a chance to talk.

58:34.315 --> 58:35.149
Clear the air.

58:38.285 --> 58:41.855
You've experienced some weird,
traumatic stuff out here.

58:43.357 --> 58:45.359
You've heard what they're
saying on the radio.

58:48.028 --> 58:48.996
Is anyone out there?

58:50.864 --> 58:52.266
And I just
wanna know that my brother

58:52.299 --> 58:53.801
and I are okay.

58:56.036 --> 59:00.874
Okay, you wanna do
this? Let's do this.

59:02.810 --> 59:03.811
We'll start with dad.

59:05.112 --> 59:07.915
Why did I have to find
out about dad on my own

59:07.948 --> 59:09.516
three months after his funeral?

59:11.919 --> 59:12.886
Are you kidding me?

59:14.922 --> 59:17.191
I called every number
I had for you, Kevin.

59:18.492 --> 59:22.096
I emailed multiple addresses,
I reached out to your friends,

59:22.129 --> 59:24.398
I drove seven fucking
hours to Nashville

59:24.431 --> 59:27.034
to your old apartment
because it was the last place

59:27.067 --> 59:29.003
I knew you physically lived.

59:29.036 --> 59:31.305
I knocked on people's
doors like a crazy person.

59:33.207 --> 59:36.277
I had Dad cremated so that
I could delay the funeral

59:36.310 --> 59:38.245
and I did everything by myself

59:38.279 --> 59:40.080
because nobody knew
where you were.

59:42.283 --> 59:44.251
I didn't tell you
about Dad, Kevin,

59:47.054 --> 59:47.988
because I couldn't find you.

59:49.490 --> 59:51.325
Does anyone copy
this transmission?

59:52.860 --> 59:53.494
Anyone?

59:54.928 --> 59:55.562
Over.

59:58.165 --> 59:59.566
When you left home-

59:59.600 --> 1:00:01.168
You mean
when you kicked me out.

1:00:02.369 --> 1:00:03.971
You didn't wanna
live by his rules.

1:00:04.004 --> 1:00:06.407
He gave you chance after chance.

1:00:07.541 --> 1:00:09.243
His rules changed
after Mom died.

1:00:09.276 --> 1:00:11.378
Everything changed
after Mom died.

1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:18.052
She was the only person who
could soften him even a little

1:00:18.085 --> 1:00:19.887
and make him look at things.

1:00:20.621 --> 1:00:22.389
No.

1:00:22.423 --> 1:00:24.558
No, I'm not gonna stand
here while you make excuses

1:00:24.591 --> 1:00:25.959
for the way he treated me.

1:00:27.328 --> 1:00:28.495
You're right.

1:00:29.363 --> 1:00:30.364
He was hard on you.

1:00:32.132 --> 1:00:33.901
I need you to
answer me, Stella,

1:00:35.102 --> 1:00:38.205
and I need to know
that you're okay.

1:00:38.238 --> 1:00:39.940
But he
loved you, Kev.

1:00:41.141 --> 1:00:41.975
He thought
I was a fuckup.

1:00:43.444 --> 1:00:46.113
You know, the two aren't
mutually exclusive, Kevin.

1:00:48.549 --> 1:00:53.253
I love you, and I think
you're a major fuckup.

1:01:04.198 --> 1:01:06.867
I don't know if you're really
clean or not this time,

1:01:07.868 --> 1:01:10.003
and I don't even know
if it matters anymore,

1:01:11.672 --> 1:01:15.008
we're all fuckups.

1:01:15.042 --> 1:01:17.878
Does anyone copy
this transmission? Anyone?

1:01:20.981 --> 1:01:22.316
Do you know why I
was able to be out here

1:01:22.349 --> 1:01:24.017
when this shit hit
the fan in Atlanta?

1:01:27.054 --> 1:01:28.455
Because I fucked up royally.

1:01:29.990 --> 1:01:32.626
I'm not even actually
a doctor anymore.

1:01:36.363 --> 1:01:38.365
I ignored a Do Not
Resuscitate order.

1:01:42.136 --> 1:01:45.406
This older lady, her
daughter brought her in.

1:01:51.378 --> 1:01:53.247
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

1:01:54.681 --> 1:01:56.683
Dad thought he was
doing the right thing.

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:02.022
I realize now that
we were both wrong.

1:02:07.327 --> 1:02:12.065
I'm sorry that you weren't
loved in the best way, Kevin.

1:02:12.901 --> 1:02:15.068
But you were loved.
You still are.

1:02:17.337 --> 1:02:18.939
Thanks, Sis. Really.

1:02:20.207 --> 1:02:21.608
It's not that I just-

1:02:23.410 --> 1:02:25.145
The camp.

1:02:25.179 --> 1:02:26.346
No, that came
from the other direction.

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:28.182
Answer me, god damn it!

1:02:31.151 --> 1:02:33.120
Jessica? Honey?

1:02:35.055 --> 1:02:35.689
Stella?

1:02:36.724 --> 1:02:38.325
Sweetie?

1:02:38.358 --> 1:02:40.093
It's me. Hey.

1:02:42.029 --> 1:02:43.263
You sound so far away.

1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:47.100
Stella?

1:02:49.136 --> 1:02:54.107
Where are you?

1:02:54.943 --> 1:02:58.512
I'm in
hell with our baby.

1:02:58.545 --> 1:03:00.314
And we'll both see you soon.

1:03:31.612 --> 1:03:33.146
Jess?

1:03:33.180 --> 1:03:34.816
Oh my god, Jess?

1:04:03.176 --> 1:04:04.278
How you feeling?

1:04:05.847 --> 1:04:07.047
In any pain?

1:04:10.584 --> 1:04:11.518
You still cramping?

1:04:17.825 --> 1:04:20.828
Can I get you something
to eat? Are you hungry?

1:04:23.765 --> 1:04:28.770
I've got my dinner
right here.

1:04:32.339 --> 1:04:33.708
Jess.

1:04:33.741 --> 1:04:34.608
I love wine.

1:04:38.545 --> 1:04:40.314
I know you do.

1:04:40.347 --> 1:04:44.384
I love junk food and I
love wine and I love Stella.

1:04:48.856 --> 1:04:49.791
I love you.

1:04:52.359 --> 1:04:54.194
I love you, too, kiddo.

1:04:56.764 --> 1:04:58.298
And so does Stella.

1:04:58.332 --> 1:04:59.232
Don't say her name.

1:05:01.468 --> 1:05:02.302
Please.

1:05:07.574 --> 1:05:09.443
You're the best
person I know, Ali.

1:05:16.450 --> 1:05:19.419
You're one of the best
people I know too, Jess.

1:05:22.522 --> 1:05:23.357
One of.

1:05:26.693 --> 1:05:28.261
But not the best.

1:05:31.431 --> 1:05:33.567
I'm not the best
person you know either.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:34.869
Yes, you are.

1:05:34.902 --> 1:05:38.271
No.

1:05:38.305 --> 1:05:39.373
Stella's great.

1:05:39.406 --> 1:05:40.474
Stella's dead.

1:05:45.212 --> 1:05:46.279
We don't know that.

1:05:48.215 --> 1:05:48.850
I know.

1:05:50.885 --> 1:05:51.819
She told me

1:05:53.988 --> 1:05:54.889
on the radio.

1:05:56.958 --> 1:06:02.162
She's dead, our baby's
dead, soon I'll be dead.

1:06:05.232 --> 1:06:07.300
- Jess.
- You, Derek-

1:06:07.334 --> 1:06:09.971
- Jess.
- Kevin.

1:06:10.004 --> 1:06:11.638
- Jess.
- And everybody.

1:06:16.510 --> 1:06:17.310
Jess.

1:06:19.013 --> 1:06:20.948
We were good together, Ali.

1:06:22.382 --> 1:06:24.451
We can be good again.

1:06:24.484 --> 1:06:26.286
I know you miss me.

1:06:26.319 --> 1:06:28.321
Jess, Jess.

1:06:31.425 --> 1:06:32.526
You're happily married.

1:06:33.961 --> 1:06:38.833
This isn't you, this is
just the stress, the fear.

1:06:39.734 --> 1:06:41.535
And oh, you're so worried-

1:06:42.804 --> 1:06:44.604
Jess, no.

1:06:44.638 --> 1:06:46.606
You wanna be with me, Ali,
I know you do, I can tell.

1:06:52.046 --> 1:06:53.715
But not like this.

1:06:58.485 --> 1:07:00.320
Then leave me alone.

1:07:01.388 --> 1:07:02.656
Jess.

1:07:02.689 --> 1:07:03.490
I said leave me
the fuck alone!

1:07:30.017 --> 1:07:31.651
How is she?

1:07:31.685 --> 1:07:34.722
Grieving,
emotionally fragile,

1:07:34.756 --> 1:07:36.758
despondent, hallucinating.

1:07:37.725 --> 1:07:38.558
Take your pick.

1:07:40.995 --> 1:07:42.329
Have you seen Derek?

1:07:44.564 --> 1:07:45.365
Kung fu grip.

1:07:46.566 --> 1:07:48.435
He's out patrolling
the perimeter

1:07:48.468 --> 1:07:50.805
making sure there's
no nut jobs out there.

1:07:50.838 --> 1:07:51.873
All right, well if you
see him will you tell him

1:07:51.906 --> 1:07:53.741
I need to talk to him?

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:55.977
Please.

1:08:16.630 --> 1:08:17.464
Jess?

1:08:21.535 --> 1:08:22.602
Jessi?

1:08:25.505 --> 1:08:26.673
Jessi!

1:08:26.707 --> 1:08:27.541
Jessi!

1:08:28.542 --> 1:08:30.812
Jessi, Jessi, Jessi, Jessi!

1:08:38.953 --> 1:08:40.021
Come on, Derek, let's go.

1:08:40.054 --> 1:08:41.722
It's time to go look for Jess.

1:08:41.756 --> 1:08:42.556
Sun's up.

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:47.728
Oh shit, I got her,
I got her, Kevin.

1:08:47.762 --> 1:08:48.595
Come on!

1:08:55.803 --> 1:08:57.839
Jessi, I'm coming!

1:08:57.872 --> 1:08:59.573
Get her out, get her out!

1:08:59.606 --> 1:09:00.607
Get her out!

1:09:05.579 --> 1:09:06.413
No, no!

1:09:15.622 --> 1:09:16.858
I can't, I can't!

1:09:17.925 --> 1:09:19.559
I can't!

1:09:19.593 --> 1:09:20.660
Ali!

1:09:20.694 --> 1:09:21.528
Ali!

1:09:47.154 --> 1:09:49.156
Oh, what the fuck, dude?

1:09:50.758 --> 1:09:53.060
She's got wounds on
her arms just like mine.

1:09:53.094 --> 1:09:55.462
Wounds you gave me
with that knife.

1:09:56.429 --> 1:09:58.465
The knife I just found
under Jessi's body.

1:09:59.566 --> 1:10:00.868
He killed her, Al.

1:10:00.902 --> 1:10:02.636
This sack of shit
murdered Jessi.

1:10:02.669 --> 1:10:06.539
Al, you said she was
despondent, hallucinating.

1:10:07.474 --> 1:10:09.710
You also called her
emotionally fragile.

1:10:09.744 --> 1:10:12.847
Are you seriously trying
to play this off as suicide?

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:14.681
She was butchered!

1:10:14.715 --> 1:10:16.549
You don't know that.

1:10:16.583 --> 1:10:19.020
Maybe it was suicide,
maybe it was murder.

1:10:20.221 --> 1:10:21.688
I didn't do it.

1:10:21.722 --> 1:10:23.490
I haven't seen
that knife in days.

1:10:24.392 --> 1:10:26.693
No more lying,
you little fucker.

1:10:26.727 --> 1:10:28.095
Come on, man, don't do this.

1:10:28.129 --> 1:10:29.596
Don't do this.

1:10:29.629 --> 1:10:30.563
We don't know what's
in the lights.

1:10:31.698 --> 1:10:34.668
We've all looked
through the lights.

1:10:34.701 --> 1:10:36.938
We've all seen the lights,
they've changed us.

1:10:39.606 --> 1:10:42.243
We don't know, maybe
the lights did it.

1:10:42.276 --> 1:10:44.078
Enough with the lights!

1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:47.081
Enough!

1:10:47.114 --> 1:10:48.249
U.S. forces
have established

1:10:48.282 --> 1:10:50.751
multiple safe zones in the area.

1:10:50.785 --> 1:10:53.520
Secure transportation
from these safe zones,

1:10:53.553 --> 1:10:55.923
government-fortified
locations will be provided

1:10:55.957 --> 1:10:58.525
to any civilians requesting it.

1:10:58.558 --> 1:11:00.694
A convoy of transports
will disembark

1:11:00.728 --> 1:11:03.030
to location designated
Safe Zone Alpha

1:11:03.064 --> 1:11:05.766
at zero hundred hours
midnight local time.

1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:08.668
The convoy will then
proceed to the designated

1:11:08.702 --> 1:11:11.638
safe zone Bravo and Charlie.

1:11:11.671 --> 1:11:13.174
Departure time from Zone Bravo

1:11:13.207 --> 1:11:15.109
is oh-two hundred hours.

1:11:15.142 --> 1:11:18.212
Departure from Zone Charlie
will be oh-four hundred hours.

1:11:18.245 --> 1:11:20.247
CQ, CQ, CQ.

1:11:20.281 --> 1:11:21.949
Does anyone read?

1:11:21.983 --> 1:11:23.550
Departure
coordinates will immediately

1:11:23.583 --> 1:11:25.152
follow this message.

1:11:25.186 --> 1:11:29.556
Communication will repeat
indefinitely on this frequency.

1:11:33.995 --> 1:11:36.097
CQ, CQ, does anyone copy?

1:11:38.799 --> 1:11:41.168
CQ, CQ, CQ.

1:11:41.202 --> 1:11:44.537
Attention, this is a U.S.
armed forces broadcast

1:11:44.571 --> 1:11:46.639
from Fort Benning, Georgia
to surrounding localities.

1:11:46.673 --> 1:11:48.075
Damn it.

1:11:48.109 --> 1:11:49.977
Under direct
order of the Pentagon,

1:11:50.011 --> 1:11:52.813
global authorities,
National Guard,

1:11:52.847 --> 1:11:57.650
U.S. forces and-

1:12:05.059 --> 1:12:06.861
Just put back
what you took out.

1:12:06.894 --> 1:12:09.030
I already told you I
didn't take anything.

1:12:09.063 --> 1:12:10.731
Then where are
the parts, Einstein?

1:12:10.765 --> 1:12:12.233
I don't know
even if I had them.

1:12:12.266 --> 1:12:13.768
Look, it's a mess in here.

1:12:13.801 --> 1:12:15.302
The wires are
stripped, hose is cut.

1:12:16.170 --> 1:12:17.004
It ain't moving.

1:12:34.687 --> 1:12:37.590
I'm so sorry I
couldn't save you, Jessi.

1:12:41.896 --> 1:12:45.598
I love you. Always.

1:12:47.234 --> 1:12:48.936
You remember the
lights to save your ass,

1:12:48.969 --> 1:12:51.305
but you forget the parts
you stole from my SUV.

1:12:52.373 --> 1:12:57.745
Yeah, this memory loss seems a
little too convenient for me.

1:13:00.781 --> 1:13:05.219
Fuck you, Derek.

1:13:05.252 --> 1:13:07.088
What, you gonna shoot
me now, asshole?

1:13:07.121 --> 1:13:08.889
I don't need a gun

1:13:08.923 --> 1:13:11.358
- to prove a point, cocksucker.
- God damnit, stop it!

1:13:11.392 --> 1:13:13.294
What is wrong with you?

1:13:14.862 --> 1:13:16.263
This isn't gonna solve anything.

1:13:18.099 --> 1:13:20.901
We have to work together from

1:13:20.935 --> 1:13:22.870
where we are with what we have.

1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:27.007
Are you calm?

1:13:28.175 --> 1:13:29.743
Yeah, I'm calm.

1:13:33.247 --> 1:13:38.252
Kevin, go get the map and
bring it to the picnic table.

1:13:40.788 --> 1:13:41.889
Go, Kevin!

1:13:46.827 --> 1:13:47.660
Prick.

1:13:50.331 --> 1:13:51.165
God.

1:13:57.905 --> 1:13:59.672
We walk.

1:13:59.707 --> 1:14:01.842
We need to make it to
Safe Zone Alpha by midnight.

1:14:01.876 --> 1:14:03.978
What's that? 13 miles?

1:14:04.011 --> 1:14:05.779
It's closer to 14.

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:09.750
The average person
walks four miles an hour.

1:14:09.783 --> 1:14:11.285
I could manage maybe three.

1:14:11.318 --> 1:14:13.020
Yeah, but that's
on flat open ground,

1:14:13.053 --> 1:14:16.123
this is steep and the
terrain gets really rough.

1:14:16.157 --> 1:14:18.292
Okay, let's say I
average half that.

1:14:18.325 --> 1:14:20.895
What's that? Nine hours?

1:14:20.928 --> 1:14:24.865
Which still gets us to
the deadline two hours past

1:14:24.899 --> 1:14:26.467
at the best.

1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:29.136
- Damn it.
- Now, Safe Zone Bravo

1:14:29.170 --> 1:14:30.905
has a two a.m. deadline.

1:14:30.938 --> 1:14:33.207
It's further away but the
terrain is a lot easier.

1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:35.376
Once we get outta the woods
it's all sloping hills

1:14:35.409 --> 1:14:36.977
and old farm roads.

1:14:37.011 --> 1:14:38.045
That's less cover.

1:14:38.078 --> 1:14:39.847
It'd leave us more exposed.

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.815
Yeah, but we have a chance
at making the deadline.

1:14:42.917 --> 1:14:45.853
It's gonna be really tight,
but I think that we could

1:14:45.886 --> 1:14:46.987
do it if we leave within
the next hour or so.

1:14:47.021 --> 1:14:48.189
Let's get walking then.

1:14:49.823 --> 1:14:52.092
Alison and I will
head for Safe Zone Bravo.

1:14:52.126 --> 1:14:53.027
You go for Alpha.

1:14:53.961 --> 1:14:55.196
What? No fucking way.

1:14:55.229 --> 1:14:56.297
What about the
weirdos out there?

1:14:56.330 --> 1:14:57.298
You'll be fine, cottonballs.

1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:00.467
Ali, I thought we were
putting this stuff behind us.

1:15:00.501 --> 1:15:02.002
We were gonna be family again.

1:15:02.036 --> 1:15:04.438
Kev, this is not
punishment, it's-

1:15:04.471 --> 1:15:06.173
- It's redundancy.

1:15:06.207 --> 1:15:07.942
When the Alpha people
get transferred to Bravo,

1:15:07.975 --> 1:15:09.410
if we're not there yet,
you do everything you can

1:15:09.443 --> 1:15:11.912
to buy us extra time
before the bus leaves.

1:15:11.946 --> 1:15:13.514
Like what, Gimpy?

1:15:13.547 --> 1:15:15.182
You could sabotage the engine.

1:16:02.863 --> 1:16:03.464
Ali?

1:16:07.935 --> 1:16:08.535
Coming.

1:16:31.325 --> 1:16:34.561
- Al, it's-
- Just give me a second.

1:16:34.595 --> 1:16:35.429
Okay?

1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:48.242
This plan is shit.

1:16:48.275 --> 1:16:49.810
It's the plan we have.

1:16:51.011 --> 1:16:52.379
I know he doesn't trust me.

1:16:52.413 --> 1:16:54.081
That's why he won't
give me the shotgun.

1:16:54.114 --> 1:16:55.949
But I don't trust him,
and neither should you.

1:16:59.953 --> 1:17:00.621
Why don't you come
with me, we could-

1:17:00.654 --> 1:17:02.289
- Kev, don't.

1:17:04.058 --> 1:17:05.426
You don't trust me either.

1:17:07.127 --> 1:17:08.929
- Kevin, I haven't se-
- No, it's fine.

1:17:15.135 --> 1:17:16.937
You should know that
I remember Hanna.

1:17:18.339 --> 1:17:22.242
Sometimes. It's spotty like
a TV with bad reception.

1:17:23.344 --> 1:17:25.212
I know that I didn't kill her,

1:17:25.245 --> 1:17:27.848
just like I know that I
didn't sabotage the SUV.

1:17:29.116 --> 1:17:31.985
And if I didn't do
it, then who did?

1:17:36.590 --> 1:17:37.958
Ali?

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:40.194
Coming.

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:47.000
What about Jessi?

1:17:53.273 --> 1:17:55.142
I honestly don't remember.

1:18:04.184 --> 1:18:05.018
Bye, Kev.

1:18:06.019 --> 1:18:08.322
This isn't goodbye,
this is see you in a few.

1:18:09.423 --> 1:18:10.257
Right?

1:18:16.130 --> 1:18:16.930
Kevin.

1:18:27.074 --> 1:18:28.642
You be careful, okay?

1:18:30.611 --> 1:18:32.045
Yeah, you too.

1:19:41.248 --> 1:19:43.050
Ali, wait up.

1:19:53.427 --> 1:19:55.730
We were making pretty good time.

1:19:55.763 --> 1:19:57.364
I thought we could take a break.

1:20:08.475 --> 1:20:09.376
You've been quiet.

1:20:10.745 --> 1:20:12.646
I was just thinking
about something Kevin said.

1:20:14.314 --> 1:20:15.148
About the lights.

1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:20.120
How's your leg?

1:20:20.153 --> 1:20:21.522
Could use some aspirin.

1:20:21.555 --> 1:20:23.056
There's some in that pack.

1:20:33.333 --> 1:20:34.201
Car parts.

1:20:45.312 --> 1:20:46.547
Babe.

1:20:46.580 --> 1:20:48.115
You ok-

1:21:05.599 --> 1:21:06.433
Alison.

1:23:33.346 --> 1:23:37.250
Fuck, Ali.

1:23:37.284 --> 1:23:38.418
Holy shit.

1:23:38.452 --> 1:23:39.453
I heard a gun shot.

1:23:39.486 --> 1:23:40.822
Are you okay? Whoa!

1:23:40.855 --> 1:23:42.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:23:42.056 --> 1:23:43.457
Why, why, why?

1:23:43.490 --> 1:23:45.358
You murdered Derek.

1:23:45.392 --> 1:23:46.359
Probably Jessi, too!

1:23:47.527 --> 1:23:50.630
No, no, I was following you.

1:23:50.664 --> 1:23:54.769
I heard the gunshots, Ali.
We have to be careful.

1:23:54.802 --> 1:23:57.839
The horde, we have to be quiet.

1:23:57.872 --> 1:24:00.440
You were supposed to be
going the other direction.

1:24:01.876 --> 1:24:04.377
I didn't wanna
leave him alone with you, Ali.

1:24:11.418 --> 1:24:14.421
I don't know what's real.

1:24:14.454 --> 1:24:17.324
The horde, they're real.

1:24:19.526 --> 1:24:20.527
We're gonna be okay.

1:24:22.063 --> 1:24:23.731
We just have to
trust each other.

1:24:24.564 --> 1:24:25.465
Put the gun down.

1:24:29.536 --> 1:24:30.370
Yeah.

1:24:31.005 --> 1:24:32.339
We're family.

1:24:36.643 --> 1:24:40.547
You're lying.

1:24:40.580 --> 1:24:41.916
Maybe, but that's
the thing, Ali.

1:24:41.949 --> 1:24:46.620
Once you see the lights,
really see the lights,

1:24:46.653 --> 1:24:48.288
the truth, it doesn't matter.

1:24:49.924 --> 1:24:53.593
So get that fucking gun
out of my fucking face!

1:24:55.428 --> 1:24:56.563
We both know that
you're not gonna pull-

1:25:02.602 --> 1:25:05.006
Oh, sis, I didn't think
you had it in you.

1:25:07.674 --> 1:25:10.912
Oh, this is gonna be
a lot messier now.

1:25:12.445 --> 1:25:14.681
You're my brother, Kevin.

1:25:14.715 --> 1:25:16.616
I don't wanna hurt you.

1:25:18.753 --> 1:25:20.587
That's the difference
between you and me, Ali.

1:25:20.620 --> 1:25:25.492
I've wanted to hurt you
for a very very long time.

1:25:25.525 --> 1:25:27.460
Even before the
lights told me to.

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:19.714
Alison!

1:26:21.648 --> 1:26:24.517
Alis, you can't
leave me like this!

1:26:25.820 --> 1:26:29.489
Alison, you always
do the right thing!

1:26:30.624 --> 1:26:31.759
Not this time.

1:26:32.692 --> 1:26:33.526
Ali!

1:26:35.763 --> 1:26:36.596
Ali!

1:26:38.698 --> 1:26:39.532
Ali!

1:27:22.009 --> 1:27:22.843
Oh god.

1:27:24.544 --> 1:27:25.578
Help, please.

1:27:26.914 --> 1:27:27.748
Alison?

1:27:28.983 --> 1:27:30.051
Is that you?

1:27:30.084 --> 1:27:30.918
Stella?

1:27:32.787 --> 1:27:34.221
Oh god, Stella.

1:27:34.255 --> 1:27:35.089
Jessi.

1:27:36.991 --> 1:27:37.825
Jessi.
