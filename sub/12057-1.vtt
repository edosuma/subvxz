00:59.268 --> 01:02.647
Beyond the barren shores of the Dead Sea

01:03.146 --> 01:07.151
lived an ancient people called the Jebusites.

01:11.738 --> 01:17.211
Thousands of years ago, on a large
outcrop of bedrock,

01:17.327 --> 01:20.797
it is said they worshipped Shalem,

01:20.872 --> 01:23.216
the god of the setting sun.

01:26.295 --> 01:30.050
The city alone was known
as the place of Shalem.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.602
Yerushalem.

02:01.872 --> 02:07.879
Over time, this city became the gateway
to God for three major religions.

02:09.545 --> 02:13.096
And the most fought over piece
of /and in history.

02:19.931 --> 02:24.027
Many believed it was the center of the world.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.268
Today, the walled old city at the heart
of Jerusalem

03:04.351 --> 03:07.651
is a mosaic of cultures and beliefs.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.486
Where Jews, Christians and Muslims
live side by side,

03:14.611 --> 03:16.830
yet in separate quarters.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.534
Each in their own Jerusalem.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.629
Everyone in Jerusalem has a favorite gate.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.465
Mine is Damascus Gate.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.312
When you enter Damascus Gate

03:48.520 --> 03:51.945
you are in the Muslim quarten my quarter

03:56.903 --> 03:58.496
This is my Jerusalem.

04:07.038 --> 04:12.010
In Arabic, we call Jerusalem, al-Quds,
which means the holy city.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.684
But it is also a place where people go
to work, where we buy our groceries,

04:18.800 --> 04:21.599
and kids play and go to school.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.085
Jerusalem to me is more than just a city.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.388
It's beauty, it's spirit
and it's also my religion.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.932
But most importantly, it's my family.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.892
Most people don't think I'm Muslim.

05:04.971 --> 05:10.273
It's only when I go to the mosque and I put
a head-scarf on, that surprises them.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.946
But Jerusalem is fu/I of surprises.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.668
Twice a week, in the Jewish quarten
there is a big celebration.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.718
For boys, it's called the bar mitzvah.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.768
For girls, it's called a bat mitzvah.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.480
It's the moment when you become an adult.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.783
Jews in Jerusalem have come from over
a hundred different countries.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.954
Take for example, my family.
My mother is from Paris.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.209
Her parents are from Tunisia.
My father's family is from Poland.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.636
No matter where we come from,
we all trace our roots back here.

06:24.175 --> 06:28.146
Sometimes I feel like I'm walking on
the same stones as my ancestors.

06:40.483 --> 06:46.161
Since Biblical times, we have a special word
when Jews return to the promised land.

06:46.823 --> 06:52.626
We say we're making aliyah, which means
going up to a higher place.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.926
And for us, the Jews, there is no higher
place than Jerusalem.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.561
For me, the best time to come to Jerusalem
is Easter

07:13.141 --> 07:16.361
Every Easter starts with
the Palm Sunday procession.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.022
It's where we walk down the Mount of Olives

07:19.105 --> 07:21.779
celebrating the day
where Jesus entered the city.

07:28.823 --> 07:32.873
Every year; me and my brother George join
in this Palm Sunday procession

07:33.036 --> 07:36.381
and we end up meeting people
from all over the world.

07:48.385 --> 07:53.232
Easter; for most people, is about the eggs,
the bunnies and decorations-

07:53.306 --> 07:57.482
But here, we still have the same Easter
like 2,000 years ago,

07:57.560 --> 08:00.109
we still re-live what happened with Jesus

08:01.564 --> 08:05.694
the passion of Christ, the same step-by-step
every Easter.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.501
In the Christian quarten we have
the Ethiopians, the Greek Orthodox,

08:17.580 --> 08:22.006
the Catholics, the Coptics, the Syrians
and each community,

08:22.085 --> 08:23.962
celebrates Easter in their own way.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.863
Next to the Christian quarter;
we have the Armenian quarter

08:42.063 --> 08:44.612
and they celebrate Easter
in their own church.

08:55.243 --> 08:59.794
The old city is very small and the
four quarters do not communicate a lot.

09:02.375 --> 09:07.256
Although we live in the same area,
we don't know a lot about each other:

09:29.819 --> 09:32.572
Smaller than a square mile,

09:32.655 --> 09:37.627
Jerusalem's old city contains some of
the holiest sites in the world

09:37.702 --> 09:40.501
for Jews, Christians and Muslims.

09:47.545 --> 09:54.269
So, how did half the people on Earth come
to cherish the same tiny space?

10:11.027 --> 10:16.329
Jerusalem lies at the crossroads of
Africa, Asia and Europe.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.913
A region known as the cradle of civilization.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.761
The Hrst empires began here
5,000 years ago.

10:36.678 --> 10:40.899
As other great powers emerged,
the /and surrounding Jerusalem

10:40.974 --> 10:43.477
became a constant battleground.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.084
Each civilization left its mark here.

11:03.913 --> 11:08.544
The Romans built vast port cities
on the Mediterranean Sea.

11:13.423 --> 11:18.179
On the tombs of Biblical prophets,
Muslims built shrines.

11:26.978 --> 11:30.653
On a high plateau, above the Dead Sea,

11:30.773 --> 11:34.949
King Herod the Great built Masada,

11:35.069 --> 11:38.164
a mountain fortress where Jewish rebels

11:38.239 --> 11:41.288
made their last stand against
the Roman army.

12:11.981 --> 12:16.908
In the Judean Desert, early Christians
built remote monasteries.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.994
Some still inhabit it to this day.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.395
Conquered over 40 times,

12:46.474 --> 12:49.193
Jerusalem is many cities.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.860
Each one built on the ruins of another

12:53.815 --> 12:57.615
And most can stil/ be found
beneath our feet.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.295
Imagine you are a detective

13:07.370 --> 13:12.592
and you try to solve a mystery based on
pieces of evidence that you put together:

13:12.709 --> 13:16.964
That's exactly what archeologists do
except that we do it for the past.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.227
One of the things that makes Jerusalem
such an exciting place to work

13:23.303 --> 13:26.432
is the continuous occupation layers,
one on top of the other.

13:26.556 --> 13:30.026
Going all the way back, 5,000 years ago
to the first inhabitants,

13:30.101 --> 13:33.150
the Biblical Jebusites, and then
through the Israelites

13:33.229 --> 13:37.530
and the Roman period, and the Crusaders
and all the way up until today.

13:40.695 --> 13:44.996
Understanding ancient Jerusalem is like
trying to put together a giant puzzle

13:45.074 --> 13:47.122
where we are missing most of the pieces

13:47.201 --> 13:50.000
and we don't know what the original
picture looked like.

13:57.587 --> 14:02.218
Everything that we dig up out of the ground
is a new piece of that puzzle.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.899
Jerusalem lies in the head of a region

14:17.982 --> 14:21.486
that has yielded some of archeology's
most incredible finds-

14:29.535 --> 14:33.415
One of the most spectacular finds
is the Dead Sea Scrolls,

14:33.498 --> 14:36.593
which were written over 2,000 years ago

14:36.667 --> 14:41.298
and are by far the oldest copies we have
of the Hebrew Bible.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.974
The deepest levels under the ground,
we #nd the earliest remains

14:51.057 --> 14:53.480
of the people who lived in this land.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.673
What is it that drew people to Jerusalem
in the first place?

15:20.711 --> 15:24.056
It's an isolated, pooi; rocky mountain town.

15:24.841 --> 15:28.471
The answer is simple. Water

15:30.430 --> 15:33.183
In the heart of the ancient city of Jerusalem

15:33.266 --> 15:37.521
is a spring which has fresh water
in it all year round.

15:40.189 --> 15:45.571
So, the inhabitants cut a tunnel through
solid bedrock to get to that water

15:58.583 --> 16:03.384
Along with waten there is another reason
Jerusalem became important.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.639
And that was at the top of the hill
that overlooked the city.

16:12.054 --> 16:16.560
The large outcrop of bedrock where
it is believed the Jebusites

16:16.684 --> 16:19.437
worshipped the god of the setting sun.

16:23.149 --> 16:29.327
In Jewish tradition, this is the foundation
stone where the world was created,

16:31.282 --> 16:34.912
and some of the most important stories
in the Bible took place.

16:37.079 --> 16:41.755
Abraham prepared to sacrihce his son,
in a test of faith.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.382
King David brought the Ark of the Covenant.

16:52.762 --> 16:58.110
And King Solomon built the first temple,
the house of God.

17:04.607 --> 17:07.952
After the temple was destroyed by
the Babylonians,

17:08.069 --> 17:12.074
the belief survived, passed down
through the Bible

17:12.198 --> 17:16.795
that Jerusalem was the closest
place on Earth to God.

17:28.089 --> 17:33.471
My grandfather came to Jerusalem when
he was 12 years old, in 1936

17:33.886 --> 17:37.436
because his father felt that something bad
is going to happen in Europe.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.814
But all the rest of his family
stayed in Poland,

17:40.893 --> 17:44.147
and they all perished during the Holocaust.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.907
He made research about every
place in the old city,

17:49.986 --> 17:53.365
and he even wrote seven books
about Jerusalem.

17:55.283 --> 17:59.004
And now in his 90s,
he is still learning every day

17:59.078 --> 18:01.206
something new about Jerusalem.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.676
It's his biggest love, I think.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.888
After his wife, but...

18:09.755 --> 18:12.850
I think, I'm sure that part of his love

18:12.925 --> 18:16.646
to Jerusalem has passed
to his family, to me.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.575
There's a tomb on the Mount of Olives,
named after the prophet Zechariah.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.371
That's where my family's name comes from.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.453
Zechariah saw the destruction of Jerusalem
over 2,000 years ago,

18:40.369 --> 18:45.842
but he prophesized that one day the Jewish
people would return to their homeland.

19:32.713 --> 19:37.093
At the end of our holiest days,
like Yom Kippur and Passover;

19:37.218 --> 19:39.266
we sing, "Next year in Jerusalem- "

19:41.347 --> 19:44.191
For hundreds of years,
this was the Jewish dream,

19:44.350 --> 19:46.227
to be back in Jerusalem,

19:46.352 --> 19:49.231
and I have the chance to live that dream.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.114
I can really feel the power of this place.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.317
How much energy is in this place.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.616
I have this tradition, to go every birthday

20:41.699 --> 20:44.623
and to put a prayer note in the wa//_

20:49.540 --> 20:54.137
We believe all prayers pass through the wal/
on their way to God.

21:07.516 --> 21:13.614
The site of Jewish longing for generations,
the Western Wall is one of four walls

21:13.689 --> 21:16.408
that support the enormous stone platform

21:16.525 --> 21:20.905
where 2,000 years ago, King Herod the Great
rebuilt the temple

21:21.781 --> 21:25.536
on a scale comparable to
the Great Pyramids of Egypt.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.376
When Herod rebuilt the temple,

21:30.456 --> 21:34.461
he surrounded the platform on which
it stood with a massive wall.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.511
We're now rounding
the southwest corner of this wall

21:39.590 --> 21:46.223
and as we come around, I want you to look
at the giant stones built into the wall.

21:46.305 --> 21:52.062
In fact, think about this: how did they get
these huge stones into position

21:52.144 --> 21:56.524
without the kind of modern machinery
that we have today?

22:05.032 --> 22:09.037
Using written records and the latest
archeological findings,

22:09.119 --> 22:12.498
we can imagine what the second temple
might have looked like

22:12.581 --> 22:15.209
at the height of its splendor

22:36.730 --> 22:41.782
Today, long after the second temple
was destroyed by the Roman army,

22:41.944 --> 22:46.950
Jews mourn its loss at the wal/
that once stood closest to it,

22:47.950 --> 22:49.873
the Western Wal/.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.359
Hundreds of years ago,

23:14.435 --> 23:18.360
my family came from Greece and Italy
to see the Holy Land,

23:18.439 --> 23:19.816
and they stayed.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.286
My mother's family settled here
in Bethlehem.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.366
It's the city where Jesus was born.

23:32.202 --> 23:36.127
On Easter; we all get together in front
of the Church of the Nativity.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.254
And sometimes
I even get to sing there with my choir

24:14.203 --> 24:18.800
For centuries, Christian pilgrims
have traced the footsteps of Jesus

24:19.208 --> 24:21.302
from his birth in Bethlehem

24:21.377 --> 24:23.505
to his death in Jerusalem.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.560
They followed the River Jordan,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.226
where many believe he was baptized,

24:36.892 --> 24:39.736
until it meets the Sea of Galilee.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.493
According to the Gospels,

24:50.572 --> 24:53.667
he began his ministry
in the village of Capernaum

24:53.742 --> 24:55.585
and taught in its synagogue.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.674
On these shores,

25:07.756 --> 25:11.260
Christians believe he gave
some of his most famous sermons

25:11.343 --> 25:13.971
and found disciples
among the local fishermen.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.445
And it is here,
in Jerusalem's garden of Gethsemane,

25:25.524 --> 25:28.152
that the New Testament says
he was arrested

25:28.235 --> 25:30.454
before being sentenced to death.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.758
On Good Friday

25:50.841 --> 25:55.563
thousands of pilgrims walk the Via Do/orosa
or Way of Sorrows,

25:56.138 --> 25:59.642
said to be the path Jesus took
on his way to cruciHxion.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.662
The procession ends
inside the Church of the Holy Sepu/chre.

26:32.508 --> 26:35.261
You know, this church is very special to me.

26:35.803 --> 26:39.603
Sometimes I see people who have
dreamed their whole life of coming here.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.357
I realize how lucky I am to live in Jerusalem.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.866
I can come to the church any time I want

26:53.987 --> 26:55.910
to touch the rock of Golgotha

26:56.657 --> 26:59.251
it's where we believe
Jesus died on the cross.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.546
And visit the tomb where he was buried

27:06.667 --> 27:10.388
and three days later rose from the dead.

27:31.275 --> 27:35.576
To understand why many believe
Jesus was crucined and buried here,

27:35.737 --> 27:37.831
we have to go underground.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.259
Deep below the church,

27:53.338 --> 27:56.638
archeologists found ancient grafHti.

28:00.262 --> 28:05.393
A ship drawn by a pilgrim
with an inscription in Latin that reads,

28:05.601 --> 28:08.445
"O Lord, we have come. "

28:09.730 --> 28:12.609
Dated to over 1, 700 years ago,

28:12.691 --> 28:15.661
it suggests that Christians worshipped here

28:15.736 --> 28:18.285
even before the church was built.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.999
In another part of the church,

28:28.081 --> 28:32.052
are ancient tombs cut into a rocky hill

28:32.127 --> 28:34.380
known as Golgotha

28:41.428 --> 28:45.183
Most archeologists believe
this was a Jewish cemetery

28:45.307 --> 28:46.934
in the time of Jesus.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.615
These tombs in the rock of Golgotha

28:57.694 --> 29:02.040
would later become the site of
Christianity's most important church,

29:02.741 --> 29:04.994
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre_

29:09.748 --> 29:13.469
Ultimately, archeology
cannot prove Jesus was buried here.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.589
This remains a matter of faith.

29:58.922 --> 30:01.300
My family has deep roots in Jerusalem.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.727
We've been here for hundreds of years.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.560
We love talking about family history

30:07.639 --> 30:10.062
especially during the month of Ramadan,

30:10.142 --> 30:13.316
when the whole family gathers
to break the fast.

30:28.744 --> 30:29.996
During Ramadan,

30:30.078 --> 30:33.457
every street competes to see
who can make the best decorations

30:33.540 --> 30:35.759
and who can throw the biggest parade.

31:27.010 --> 31:31.186
To the Muslim world,
Jerusalem is the city of the prophets,

31:31.556 --> 31:34.776
Abraham, David and Jesus.

31:40.482 --> 31:44.203
Muslims believe that the last of the prophets
was Muhammad,

31:44.277 --> 31:48.123
and that one night, he was taken
on a miraculous journey

31:48.198 --> 31:51.452
from Mecca to Jerusalem,

31:52.160 --> 31:55.881
where he ascended to heaven
on a ladder of light.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.224
For over a thousand years,

32:09.302 --> 32:12.681
Muslims have linked
the Prophet Muhammad's night journey

32:13.014 --> 32:17.110
with the stone platform that houses
the golden Dome of the Rock

32:17.185 --> 32:19.187
and the mosque at the southern end.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.784
When you go up to the mosque,

32:32.868 --> 32:36.338
you leave all the noises
and the crowds behind you.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.631
You come out to this wide open space

32:41.710 --> 32:45.055
HI/ed with birds and trees.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.476
It's like you're in another world.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.952
Out of all the buildings in Jerusalem,

33:15.035 --> 33:18.790
the most beautiful to me is
the Dome of the Rock.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.798
The Dome of the Rock
is actually built over a rock,

34:01.873 --> 34:03.625
which we call al-Sakhrah,

34:03.708 --> 34:07.008
where we believe Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him,

34:07.128 --> 34:11.850
rose to the heaven
and led all the prophets in prayer

34:23.018 --> 34:25.317
Built 1,300 years ago,

34:25.397 --> 34:29.902
the Dome of the Rock is among the
oldest Islamic monuments in the world.

34:32.987 --> 34:36.743
But why here, just above the Western Wa/I?

34:37.951 --> 34:42.297
What is it about this site that made it
the gateway to God for Muslims?

34:54.134 --> 34:56.762
The oldest map of Jerusalem
ever discovered

34:56.844 --> 35:01.066
shows that when the Muslims arrived
as conquerors in the seventh century

35:01.474 --> 35:03.602
they found a Christian city,

35:03.685 --> 35:06.780
dominated by the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.494
It is said they were invited to pray
inside the church,

35:19.576 --> 35:23.626
but asked instead to be taken
to the top of the stone platform

35:23.705 --> 35:26.003
to look for their own place of worship.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.847
They found it abandoned,
filled with rubbish.

35:41.348 --> 35:45.819
Only once they cleaned it did they uncover
what they were searching for

35:50.774 --> 35:53.118
The large outcrop of bedrock,

35:54.277 --> 35:58.157
the object at the center
of Jerusalem's sacred stories.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.798
Today, the Dome of the Rock
guards the ancient stone,

36:11.044 --> 36:16.801
where it is believed the Jebusites
once worshipped, the temple stood,

36:16.883 --> 36:20.262
and the Prophet Muhammad
ascended to heaven.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.488
On the Saturday before Easter;

37:20.572 --> 37:24.247
Orthodox Christians celebrate
the resurrection of Jesus

37:24.325 --> 37:26.748
in the ceremony of the Ho/y Fire,

37:28.538 --> 37:31.633
one of the oldest rituals in Christianity.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.265
On the Jewish High Holy Days,

37:47.348 --> 37:51.444
Jews gather at the Western Wall
for the priestly blessing,

37:53.146 --> 37:56.821
said to be the same blessing
given by priests in the temple

37:56.900 --> 37:58.743
3,000 years ago.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.416
In the Hnal days of Ramadan,

38:12.499 --> 38:17.721
Muslims believe the sky opens up
and all their prayers are answered.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.656
When I come to the Old City,

39:59.898 --> 40:02.697
I see Christians and Muslims,

40:03.151 --> 40:06.997
and I'm very curious about
how do they see Jerusalem.

40:15.121 --> 40:18.295
And I also wonder if they're
curious about my community

40:18.416 --> 40:20.214
about my life.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.688
Every religion has an assumption
of one another

40:33.348 --> 40:34.850
We think we 're so different,

40:35.308 --> 40:38.437
but we have more in common
than we realize.

40:42.315 --> 40:46.991
We live in this small area,
and I know we all love it.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.951
We all love Jerusalem.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.667
You know, I hope one day
we can have the courage

40:56.788 --> 41:00.133
to meet the people
who are living right next to us.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.551
Maybe not yet.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.554
Someday, yes.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.984
Jews, Christians and Muslims,

41:23.064 --> 41:26.238
have often found themselves in conflict.

41:26.734 --> 41:31.581
Yet they share a heritage and a love
for the land that nourish their beliefs.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.793
Nowhere is this more apparent
than Jerusalem.

41:40.707 --> 41:45.554
This city on a hill binds together
the hopes of the world.
