WEBVTT

00:01.724 --> 00:06.689
Previously on
Survivor, the majority had plan.

00:06.724 --> 00:07.310
Of attack.

00:07.344 --> 00:09.586
Aurora has good to go.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.931
But wardog wanted to
Shake up the game.

00:12.965 --> 00:14.137
Vote kelley tonight.

00:14.172 --> 00:16.286
It's time to make a move on the
Last returning player, and.

00:16.309 --> 00:19.689
That's kelley wentworth.

00:19.724 --> 00:24.724
At tribal council wardog left
Lauren in the dark and betrayed.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.344
His closest ally.

00:26.379 --> 00:29.517
A lot of lying going on.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.000
When he voted out Wentworth.

00:31.034 --> 00:36.137
Wentworth, the tribe has spoken.

00:36.172 --> 00:39.206
And she grabbed the torch and
Headed to the edge of.

00:39.241 --> 00:41.241
Extinction.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.068 --> 00:58.517
Down to eight.

00:58.551 --> 01:00.482
Tribal council sucked.

01:00.517 --> 01:04.516
It's really sad the lose kelley,
Not just on like a "Survivor".

01:04.551 --> 01:07.689
Level with someone who I
Genuinely trusted, but on a.

01:07.724 --> 01:11.793
Personal level, she felt like my
Older sister.

01:11.827 --> 01:15.137
So I'll just be first to say
Anybody want to... Obviously two.

01:15.172 --> 01:16.413
People flipped.

01:16.448 --> 01:19.758
I think I can guess who it is,
But do you guys want to say it?

01:19.793 --> 01:20.827
Ron and wardog.

01:20.862 --> 01:22.482
Ron and wardog?

01:22.517 --> 01:25.586
I'm so angry and so mad at
Wardog.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.275
I actually kind of feel like I'm
Out for flood.

01:28.310 --> 01:32.000
At the same time, I also want
The take rick out just because

01:32.034 --> 01:34.827
Rick poses a threat to everyone,
But I don't know who wants to.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.068
Work with me anymore.

01:36.103 --> 01:40.689
I think I can get others to
Rally behind me, but it is this.

01:40.724 --> 01:46.793
Weird feeling of I don't know
Where people stand anymore.

01:46.827 --> 01:51.413
It was mice being in on it
Instead of being on the outs.

01:51.448 --> 01:52.655
But that's part of it.

01:52.689 --> 01:56.379
When you say to me, I just
Wish I was in on it, you only.

01:56.413 --> 01:58.655
Wish you were in on it after the
Votes were done.

01:58.689 --> 02:00.689
I thought we still could have
Waited.

02:00.724 --> 02:03.620
Because kelley had allies.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.206
If anything I couldn't take
Kelley out.

02:05.241 --> 02:07.034
You had allies also.

02:07.068 --> 02:10.517
There was no wait, because I
Don't think you were going to.

02:10.550 --> 02:11.827
Flip on her.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.206
You go where the numbers go.

02:13.241 --> 02:16.137
I thought me, you and ron
Were the tightest.

02:16.172 --> 02:18.965
I trusted wardog 100%.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.517
Going into tribal council, I
Felt really confident in my.

02:21.551 --> 02:22.689
Game.

02:22.724 --> 02:25.103
I was left out of the vote, so
Now I know that bridge is.

02:25.137 --> 02:25.965
Burned.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.275
Wardog is just barking out
Orders.

02:28.310 --> 02:29.827
Wardog talked to me like a dog.

02:29.862 --> 02:30.517
I ain't having that.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.724
Right now I'm upset, gavin.

02:32.758 --> 02:35.103
You like to stay with the
Numbers all the way.

02:35.137 --> 02:36.355
You don't like rocking the boat.

02:36.379 --> 02:41.379
You can't be barking out
Orders 24/7 and expect people to.

02:41.413 --> 02:42.344
Work with you.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.379
He's next on my list.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.413
I want wardog out now.

02:45.448 --> 02:50.241
I hate that wardog got as pissed
As he did.

02:50.275 --> 02:50.931
He got pissed here.

02:50.965 --> 02:53.724
He talked to me like a dog.

02:53.758 --> 02:54.931
My god.

02:54.965 --> 02:59.206
I'd rather make big moves
With you all than be talked to.

02:59.241 --> 03:00.103
Like a dog.

03:00.137 --> 03:01.068
I ain't about that life.

03:01.103 --> 03:03.034
I feel like I'm next on the
Chopping block.

03:03.068 --> 03:04.034
That's not true.

03:04.068 --> 03:07.034
Well, not in my mind, buddy.

03:07.068 --> 03:10.724
I was working with wardog to
Get out kelley, but then I'm.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.137
Thinking, he's a loose cannon.

03:12.172 --> 03:14.034
He says too much.

03:14.068 --> 03:18.379
He talked to gavin like gavin
Was ten years old, and it really.

03:18.413 --> 03:19.551
Hurt gavin's feeling.

03:19.586 --> 03:22.068
It's perfect because it cut
Those two in half.

03:22.103 --> 03:26.034
I'll do whatever, make a move
Wherever you guys want, and I'm.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.793
An easy vote for it.

03:27.827 --> 03:29.586
So appreciate you guys.

03:29.620 --> 03:32.620
I feel like my game is going
Pretty good because I have lots.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.034
Of different options and I'm
Trying the play both sides.

03:35.068 --> 03:37.862
The only thing I was worried
About was julie, because she's.

03:37.896 --> 03:45.896
The one I need to mend fences
With.

03:46.137 --> 03:47.620
I'm in the like that.

03:47.655 --> 03:49.551
I'm not super emotional.

03:49.586 --> 03:51.896
As emotional as I am in this
Game...

03:51.931 --> 03:53.206
I feel so bad.

03:53.241 --> 03:58.068
But it's wetter... better for
Us not to always vote together.

03:58.103 --> 04:02.379
I'm with you, and I have
Something else to tell you.

04:02.413 --> 04:04.862
Aurora gave me her extra vote to
Show trust.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.655
It's still her, but I have it.

04:06.689 --> 04:09.310
If she had gone home tonight, I
Was going to use it.

04:09.344 --> 04:10.793
Are you kidding me?

04:10.827 --> 04:12.068
No.

04:12.103 --> 04:15.344
I told julie about the extra
Vote, because I need julie to.

04:15.379 --> 04:18.586
Feel confident and trust me so
That she's completely loyal to.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.620
Me.

04:19.654 --> 04:21.724
I'll watch you back as long
As you watch mine.

04:21.757 --> 04:23.965
I want to work with you until
The end.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.620
I do want to work with you, Too.

04:27.655 --> 04:28.827
You're with me, I'm with you.

04:28.862 --> 04:32.241
Even though I clearly was
Left out of tonight's vote, I.

04:32.275 --> 04:33.137
Don't blame ron at all.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.413
It was a good move.

04:35.448 --> 04:37.310
I have no hard feelings against
Ron.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.827
He's the only person in the game
I feel like I can truly trust.

04:39.862 --> 04:47.862
I do think he has my back.

04:53.068 --> 04:56.689
Nice.

04:56.724 --> 04:59.275
There's a lot of lying going On.

04:59.310 --> 05:02.517
At tribal last night, ron,
Myself, and wardog voted.

05:02.551 --> 05:04.103
Together to get rid of kelley.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.448
And no one was happier than me
That kelley wentworth was headed.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.724
To the edge of extinction.

05:09.758 --> 05:16.000
So ron and wardog and I kind of
Need each other.

05:16.034 --> 05:22.172
So here's a realization that I
Had, okay, that we're the only.

05:22.206 --> 05:23.424
Threats in players in the game.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.310
Yeah.

05:24.344 --> 05:27.103
We're the only ones with the
Resume.

05:27.137 --> 05:28.379
Yeah.

05:28.413 --> 05:30.251
I think those girls haven't
Been players, but they're going.

05:30.275 --> 05:33.793
To want to build their resume,
And none of them are going to.

05:33.827 --> 05:34.413
Take us to the end.

05:34.448 --> 05:36.206
I am totally with that.

05:36.241 --> 05:38.310
I don't want either one of you
All gone.

05:38.344 --> 05:41.275
If we turn on each other too
Soon, none of us get.

05:41.310 --> 05:43.172
There we all agree on that.

05:43.206 --> 05:45.551
We're each other's biggest
Threat and our only hope.

05:45.586 --> 05:46.862
I hear you.

05:46.896 --> 05:51.172
Wardog has been my nemesis in
This game, but now we need each.

05:51.206 --> 05:54.310
Other going forward as a shield,
Because as soon as one of us.

05:54.344 --> 05:56.310
Goes out, it will be a feeding
Frenzy.

05:56.344 --> 05:59.517
I see the people that have not
Built mump of a resume starting.

05:59.551 --> 06:02.448
To build their resume by getting
Rid of one threat after the.

06:02.482 --> 06:03.172
Other.

06:03.206 --> 06:04.424
We got to take the girls out.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.758
The three of us get rid of
Aurora.

06:06.793 --> 06:07.793
Take aurora out.

06:07.827 --> 06:09.517
And then just work it from
There.

06:09.551 --> 06:13.793
Aurora is definitely on the
Bottom.

06:13.827 --> 06:15.034
She's an easy vote.

06:15.068 --> 06:18.413
Because she's been named every
Tribal, everyone was going for

06:18.448 --> 06:19.000
Aurora.

06:19.034 --> 06:19.862
She's a big competitor.

06:19.896 --> 06:22.379
She's a challenge beast.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.251
And you never know what she's
Going to say at tribal.

06:24.275 --> 06:27.793
The only way we can protect
Each other is if we stay.

06:27.827 --> 06:29.034
Together.

06:29.068 --> 06:31.448
So I think the three of us need
To figure out a way we stay.

06:31.482 --> 06:32.689
Yeah.

06:32.724 --> 06:35.413
The game I'm playing right
Now is ron is everyone's ally,

06:35.448 --> 06:37.965
And if I don't work with you
Right now, maybe next time.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.310
We have to convince them to
Vote out a lesser threat as.

06:43.344 --> 06:44.586
Opposed to a bigger threat.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.827
That could be tricky.

06:45.862 --> 06:49.620
We have to stick together for
At least a few more votes.

06:49.655 --> 06:53.103
If we take aurora out, there
Is no plot against her.

06:53.137 --> 06:56.931
The road ahead of me will be
Difficult.

06:56.965 --> 06:59.586
Either way I can join either
Alliance.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.758
So I've got a tough decision to
Make.

07:01.793 --> 07:04.103
I love having power and control.

07:04.137 --> 07:07.000
And it puts me in the middle
Again where I get to make a.

07:07.034 --> 07:14.586
Decision.

07:21.758 --> 07:22.655
All right.

07:22.689 --> 07:26.724
Let's get to today's reward
Challenge.

07:26.758 --> 07:30.241
For today's challenge, you're
Going to swim out to a platform,

07:30.275 --> 07:34.448
Run across it, jump in, pull
Yourself under the platform,

07:34.482 --> 07:36.931
Retrieve a ring, and race to the
Finish.

07:36.965 --> 07:39.862
Once you have all three rings,
You'll attempt to land them on.

07:39.896 --> 07:45.206
Three targets.

07:45.241 --> 07:47.068
First four finish win reward.

07:47.103 --> 07:48.724
Want to know what you're playing
For?

07:48.758 --> 07:49.931
Yes.

07:49.965 --> 07:54.310
You'll be taken from
Here to the sabato mud baths.

07:54.344 --> 07:58.586
Where you will enjoy sandwich,
Chicken, shredded pork, roast.

07:58.620 --> 08:02.310
Beef, salad, wine, juice, and
Brownies for dessert.

08:02.344 --> 08:03.517
My god.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.310
Treat your body both
Inside and out.

08:06.344 --> 08:06.827
Worth playing for?

08:06.862 --> 08:07.931
Yes.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.275
We're going to do a
Schoolyard pick.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.137
Let's do this!

08:12.172 --> 08:18.137
All right!

08:18.172 --> 08:19.034
All right.

08:19.068 --> 08:21.517
We have our two teams.

08:21.551 --> 08:27.241
For blue, it is lauren, wardog,
Devens, and julie.

08:27.275 --> 08:32.136
For yellow it's ron, aurora,
Gavin, and victoria.

08:32.172 --> 08:34.309
For reward, here we go.

08:34.344 --> 08:36.724
Survivors ready?

08:36.758 --> 08:42.413
Go!

08:42.448 --> 08:44.448
Wardog off the a slippery start.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.068
Good job, wardog.

08:46.103 --> 08:48.034
Good job, ron.

08:48.068 --> 08:49.103
Wardog.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.827
Wardog is swimming to
The wrong platform.

08:51.862 --> 08:53.241
Watch out, wardog.

08:53.275 --> 08:54.896
You're going to wrong way.

08:54.931 --> 08:56.206
To your right.

08:56.241 --> 08:57.448
To your right, wardog.

08:57.482 --> 08:58.310
Ron gets there first.

08:58.344 --> 09:00.413
You have to get up and race
Across it.

09:00.448 --> 09:01.448
Come on, ron.

09:01.482 --> 09:02.275
Push it, brother.

09:02.310 --> 09:03.206
Get across.

09:03.241 --> 09:11.241
Jump in and pull yourself under.

09:16.448 --> 09:24.275
Wardog and ron come up for air.

09:24.310 --> 09:25.137
Wardog is there.

09:25.172 --> 09:25.655
Ron is there.

09:25.689 --> 09:27.862
Good job, wardog.

09:27.896 --> 09:29.965
That aboy, ron.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.896
Now you're going to
Untie one ring.

09:31.931 --> 09:33.103
One ring.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.241
That's it, buddy.

09:34.275 --> 09:35.586
Wardog has his.

09:35.620 --> 09:36.724
Ron has his.

09:36.758 --> 09:37.689
Wardog in the water first.

09:37.724 --> 09:38.275
There goes ron.

09:38.310 --> 09:39.517
Nice, ron.

09:39.551 --> 09:41.758
You got this, dog.

09:41.793 --> 09:44.689
You got to get back
On the platform before the next.

09:44.724 --> 09:46.000
Person can go.

09:46.034 --> 09:47.931
Come on, come on, come on.

09:47.965 --> 09:49.931
Gavin pulls up ron.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.827
Go, yellow!

09:51.862 --> 09:55.862
Go, blue!

09:55.896 --> 09:59.586
It's aurora whipping through the
Water.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.137
Go, aurora.

10:02.172 --> 10:07.551
Aurora is on fire.

10:07.586 --> 10:08.275
Lauren back up now.

10:08.310 --> 10:14.965
Good job, good job.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.758
Lauren trying to stay In it.

10:16.793 --> 10:17.275
She's back in the water.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.551
Good job, lauren.

10:18.586 --> 10:19.482
Good job.

10:19.517 --> 10:23.793
Aurora does not come Up for air.

10:23.827 --> 10:25.655
Damn.

10:25.689 --> 10:31.482
Lauren pops up for
Air, slowing down a little more.

10:31.517 --> 10:37.241
Aurora is whipping through this
Challenge.

10:37.275 --> 10:38.068
Aurora back in the water.

10:38.103 --> 10:39.517
Amazing toss.

10:39.551 --> 10:42.758
That's how you do it
On "Survivor," right there.

10:42.793 --> 10:44.689
Good job, lauren.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.793
Lauren is untying her Ring.

10:46.827 --> 10:48.034
Good job, good job.

10:48.068 --> 10:49.206
There goes lauren.

10:49.241 --> 10:51.206
Good job.

10:51.241 --> 10:53.965
Trying to get aurora
Back on the platform.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.034
You're good, yellow.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.758
Get in the water.

10:56.793 --> 11:00.689
Now you got to land those rings,
One on each post.

11:00.724 --> 11:02.379
Yellow with a big lead.

11:02.413 --> 11:03.689
Lauren is back for blue.

11:03.724 --> 11:04.172
You're good.

11:04.206 --> 11:12.206
Get in the water.

11:13.103 --> 11:14.310
Gavin connects for yellow.

11:14.344 --> 11:15.275
Yellow has one.

11:15.310 --> 11:17.620
Devens just misses with his
Second.

11:17.655 --> 11:18.803
Devens trying the keep it close.

11:18.827 --> 11:20.275
Devens connects.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.965
It is 1-1.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.068
Good job.

11:24.103 --> 11:26.482
And just like that it
Is blue in the lead.

11:26.517 --> 11:29.965
Gavin now is the one that's got
To pick it up.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.034
Gavin hits.

11:31.068 --> 11:32.586
On and off.

11:32.620 --> 11:35.275
Devens could win it right here.

11:35.310 --> 11:38.000
Just short.

11:38.034 --> 11:38.724
Gavin trying the tie it up.

11:38.758 --> 11:39.034
No.

11:39.068 --> 11:39.965
Dang.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.103
Devens one more time
For the win.

11:46.137 --> 11:49.034
Devens does it!

11:49.068 --> 11:57.068
Julie, lauren, wardog, and
Devens win reward.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.103
All right.

12:02.137 --> 12:06.310
Devens, wardog, julie, lauren,
Nice afternoon awaits.

12:06.344 --> 12:11.275
Bring it in.

12:11.310 --> 12:13.068
Your chariot awaits.

12:13.103 --> 12:18.551
Hop on.

12:18.586 --> 12:20.620
My god.

12:20.655 --> 12:24.034
Aurora, gavin, ron,
Victoria, I got nothing for you.

12:24.068 --> 12:29.068
Swim out.

12:29.103 --> 12:32.103
So we lost the reward
Challenge, but now this is an.

12:32.137 --> 12:35.034
Opportunity for me to build a
Strong relationship with

12:35.068 --> 12:37.068
Victoria, ron, and aurora.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.931
I feel like wardog has it out
For me, but I want a little.

12:39.965 --> 12:42.965
Sweet revenge, and I want his
Head on a silver platter.

13:01.586 --> 13:04.137
Honestly, I have not had one
Fun day here.

13:04.172 --> 13:08.724
That's why I'm so mad.

13:08.758 --> 13:10.000
This game is so hard.

13:10.034 --> 13:12.000
I feel like I'm just going to
Cry.

13:12.034 --> 13:12.965
Sorry.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.965
I'll try not to be a hot mess
Around camp.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.413
Ly remove myself.

13:16.448 --> 13:19.241
You're okay.

13:19.275 --> 13:20.586
I know, I know.

13:20.620 --> 13:22.034
I know, you've been through it.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.206
I know.

13:23.241 --> 13:25.758
Getting voted out with an
Idol in my pocket, knowing I.

13:25.793 --> 13:29.724
Made a mistake, knowing I'm a
Perfectionist, I feel mad at.

13:29.758 --> 13:32.655
Myself because I didn't trust my
Gut and I should have.

13:32.689 --> 13:35.689
You all feel better?

13:35.724 --> 13:37.000
Give her a hug.

13:37.034 --> 13:38.275
Group hug.

13:38.310 --> 13:41.241
Usually when you leave the
Game and head somewhere and mask.

13:41.275 --> 13:44.172
All these feelings, but you come
To the edge still dealing with.

13:44.206 --> 13:45.379
It.

13:45.413 --> 13:50.034
And I know that I will beat
Myself up over this for a long.

13:50.068 --> 13:53.034
Time.

13:53.068 --> 13:58.586
Yesterday at camp we were having
Conversations and I was like,

13:58.620 --> 13:59.379
Don't be paranoid.

13:59.413 --> 14:02.379
You have to laugh at it all.

14:02.413 --> 14:02.827
It's a game.

14:02.862 --> 14:04.551
It's so hard.

14:04.586 --> 14:07.172
Finally kelley gets voted Out.

14:07.206 --> 14:09.044
Like I don't know what the hell
Took them so long.

14:09.068 --> 14:12.827
I was trying to do that on day
Three which ended up getting me.

14:12.862 --> 14:13.310
Voted out.

14:13.344 --> 14:16.482
I mean, bravo.

14:16.517 --> 14:17.896
Finally.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.206
Kama is so stupid.

14:19.241 --> 14:20.482
I'm happy that went down.

14:20.517 --> 14:22.068
She said, liars.

14:22.103 --> 14:24.862
I was like, listen, dude, karma.

14:24.896 --> 14:25.896
Karma's a bitch.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.482
That's what happens.

14:27.517 --> 14:33.103
Kelley, I'm not going to lie to
You, I'm mad.

14:33.137 --> 14:35.137
I'm sure you picked up on that.

14:35.172 --> 14:38.931
I feel like my "Survivor"
Experience wasn't because of.

14:38.965 --> 14:39.586
You.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.310
Well, I apologize, reem.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.413
I really don't.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.655
But don't act like people
Don't come here and have.

14:45.689 --> 14:47.517
Diarrhea of the mouth about
What's going on.

14:47.551 --> 14:49.965
Everybody is talking about
What's going on, you know what I.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.103
Mean?

14:51.137 --> 14:53.862
Kelley was part of getting rid
Of me, kind of killed my.

14:53.896 --> 14:54.965
"Survivor" dream, per se.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.482
So that sucks.

14:56.517 --> 14:58.241
It sucks as a super fan.

14:58.275 --> 14:58.862
It sucks.

14:58.896 --> 15:00.034
So I had to say something.

15:00.068 --> 15:01.758
I really did.

15:01.793 --> 15:05.137
Because everyone here at edge of
Extinction is mad at somebody,

15:05.172 --> 15:09.068
And if you don't let it off your
Chest, it is just going to get.

15:09.103 --> 15:12.137
Ugly, and it's going to fester,
So get it off your chest.

15:12.172 --> 15:16.068
Everybody knows there's a
Healing process once you're.

15:16.103 --> 15:22.586
Here, but it takes time.

15:22.620 --> 15:27.689
I came in this time with the
Idea I would have to be more.

15:27.724 --> 15:30.931
Open and vulnerable and connect
With people, so getting voted.

15:30.965 --> 15:36.172
Out and coming to the edge does
Make me like face my demons in a.

15:36.206 --> 15:36.965
Way.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.655
Like I realize I'm so
Competitive.

15:39.689 --> 15:44.413
And I think I'm a very tough
Cookie, tough exterior, and I'm.

15:44.448 --> 15:48.482
Not super vulnerable, and so I
Just hope that this experience.

15:48.517 --> 15:52.034
Translates into real life and
Helps me grow as a person.

15:52.068 --> 15:54.137
Because what's important is
What's back home.

15:54.172 --> 15:57.655
Like I have a husband who has
Allowed me to do this three.

15:57.689 --> 15:58.931
Times.

15:58.965 --> 16:00.907
I have family who is probably
Going to laugh at the fact they.

16:00.931 --> 16:04.034
Was an idiot and went home with
An idol in my pocket.

16:04.068 --> 16:07.103
So even though this is not easy.

16:07.137 --> 16:08.931
You've been out here a while.

16:08.965 --> 16:11.586
I think you may want to get out
Of the sun.

16:11.620 --> 16:15.517
Hopefully once this chapter
Is closed on the edge of.

16:15.551 --> 16:18.896
Extinction, I will look back and
Say, I made my mistakes, I'm at.

16:18.931 --> 16:26.931
Peace with it, and it was also a
Great experience in its own way.

16:28.965 --> 16:36.965
Peace with it, and it was also a
Great experience in its own way.

16:39.620 --> 16:43.482
We come back the camp after
Losing the reward, and it's.

16:43.517 --> 16:44.275
Disappointing.

16:44.310 --> 16:47.034
I haven't eaten really in 11
Days.

16:47.068 --> 16:48.793
But losing today is a great
Opportunity.

16:48.827 --> 16:53.034
So I'm thinking what if we
Stoke some coconut and coffee.

16:53.068 --> 16:56.034
Coconut and coffee?

16:56.068 --> 16:59.000
Because I know this afternoon
I'll have time with victoria,

16:59.034 --> 17:00.275
Aurora, and gavin.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.206
So hopefully it buys me a little
Time to figure out what's best.

17:03.241 --> 17:04.241
For me.

17:04.275 --> 17:08.241
Let's have a day in paradise,
How about that?

17:08.275 --> 17:09.655
That was fun, the challenge.

17:09.689 --> 17:12.378
Devens is very athletic.

17:12.413 --> 17:17.827
He's probably one of the least
Typical, but he's a beast.

17:17.862 --> 17:21.931
I think all devens did again
Today is prove how much he has.

17:21.964 --> 17:22.482
To go.

17:22.517 --> 17:23.413
Yep.

17:23.448 --> 17:25.113
Devens is definitely the most
Dangerous.

17:25.137 --> 17:28.205
I think we can all vote Devens.

17:28.241 --> 17:30.965
I'm letting you know what I
Need to do.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.482
I'm an easy vote for you.

17:34.517 --> 17:39.482
The group was leaning toward
Taking rick devens, who is a.

17:39.517 --> 17:43.758
Favorite from the jury's point
Of view.

17:43.793 --> 17:46.862
I'd rather fake out wardog
Because he betrayed me,

17:46.896 --> 17:48.344
Unfortunately I have to be
Adaptable.

17:48.379 --> 17:51.241
I have to go with the numbers at
This point because I have no.

17:51.275 --> 17:54.482
Traction, but I think eventually
Wardog is going to crumble, and

17:54.517 --> 17:55.275
I'll still be here.

17:55.310 --> 17:58.965
We all put our votes on Devens.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.482
I truly think it's if best Move.

18:00.517 --> 18:03.758
Yep.

18:03.793 --> 18:07.137
Before tribal council aurora
Gave me her extra vote.

18:07.172 --> 18:10.000
For a moment I'm thinking maybe
I could keep the vote for.

18:10.034 --> 18:12.689
Myself, but then I'm thinking,
I'd rather give it back to her.

18:12.724 --> 18:16.689
Because that's a better move for
Me.

18:16.724 --> 18:19.896
I'm trying to get aurora to
Trust me completely, and I think.

18:19.931 --> 18:23.413
If she feels, that she will do
Whatever I need her to do.

18:23.448 --> 18:26.103
Or if I choose, I can vote her
Out.

18:26.137 --> 18:31.172
She won't see it coming.

18:31.206 --> 18:35.103
The tide is really low, so
I'm going to bring basket down.

18:35.137 --> 18:36.620
And see if I can find some
Snails.

18:36.655 --> 18:39.172
I'm going to keep eating
Until you come back.

18:39.206 --> 18:40.413
And I high still keep eating.

18:40.448 --> 18:42.758
I'm going to cook a lot of Rice.

18:42.793 --> 18:44.586
Do one cup.

18:44.620 --> 18:47.241
Ron, we've got to keep going on
This.

18:47.275 --> 18:51.379
We don't have that much left.

18:51.413 --> 18:54.827
No, one cup for four is going
To be perfectly fine.

18:54.862 --> 18:57.172
Aurora, you're not the rice
Nazi.

18:57.206 --> 19:01.413
I'd rather...
ron is the quickest to get.

19:01.448 --> 19:03.551
Snappy when he doesn't get his
Way.

19:03.586 --> 19:11.586
At this point we are literally
Dating each other when all we.

19:12.793 --> 19:14.448
Want to do is break up.

19:14.482 --> 19:18.655
It is the drama queen in ron
That comes outs, but I'm used to.

19:18.689 --> 19:21.034
Being around drama queens
Because I am one.

19:21.068 --> 19:24.068
So you're not going to win with
Me.

19:24.103 --> 19:27.137
Tomorrow we move to three
Scoops a day.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.379
Aurora gets on my nerves so Bad.

19:29.413 --> 19:33.379
She wants to have control of
Every situation every moment.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.827
I have made it a month with
Aurora.

19:35.862 --> 19:39.517
If I have to go to 39 days with
Her, I need to get $2 million,

19:39.551 --> 19:40.655
Not $1 million.

19:40.689 --> 19:42.137
Is the tide still low?

19:42.172 --> 19:44.344
Want to go look at it real
Quick?

19:44.379 --> 19:52.379
You're driving me crazy.

19:53.758 --> 19:55.034
It feels good.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.344
That feels so good.

19:56.379 --> 19:57.137
Wow.

19:57.172 --> 19:58.689
Very nice.

19:58.724 --> 19:59.827
Today is a great day.

19:59.862 --> 20:00.758
We won the challenge.

20:00.793 --> 20:02.655
I got chance to get my body
Right.

20:02.689 --> 20:04.103
I can feel relaxed.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.310
I have some time away from camp.

20:06.344 --> 20:07.275
I'll recharge, right?

20:07.310 --> 20:09.241
I got 11 more days in this game.

20:09.275 --> 20:12.482
I know the end is near, and this
Will be the boost I need.

20:12.517 --> 20:14.275
Want me to get your back?

20:14.310 --> 20:17.724
Testify come on, you do my
Become an I'll do yourings.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.551
Yeah,.

20:18.586 --> 20:22.034
Nothing better than having.

20:22.068 --> 20:22.931
Devens rub mud on me.

20:22.965 --> 20:25.482
I have dreamed of this since
Day one.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.655
Finally, day 28.

20:26.689 --> 20:31.068
Wardog and I have, who have had
Such an up-and-down game.

20:31.103 --> 20:32.286
Strategically, are rubbing the
Mud on each other.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.517
Look at that.

20:34.551 --> 20:36.689
And we cover each other head to
Toe.

20:36.724 --> 20:37.482
We're having fun.

20:37.517 --> 20:39.482
The girls are doing the same
Thing.

20:39.517 --> 20:41.310
This is a bonding experience.

20:41.344 --> 20:44.793
We're going to be very close
After this.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.965
You want the talk on heaven.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.034
Heaven is getting mud rubbed on
You by wardog in fiji.

20:52.068 --> 20:53.827
Yeah.

20:53.862 --> 20:56.310
It's like a hot tub.

20:56.344 --> 20:58.206
This feels amazing.

20:58.241 --> 20:59.620
I love hot water.

20:59.655 --> 21:03.068
Going into this reward, the
Way the teams worked out, I'm.

21:03.103 --> 21:06.413
Not looking at it as a strategic
Opportunity, because lauren and

21:06.448 --> 21:08.137
Julie are not playing the game.

21:08.172 --> 21:10.103
They're just going where the
Wind blows.

21:10.137 --> 21:13.103
They're not in the driver's
Seat, and they seem okay with&4p.

21:13.137 --> 21:16.758
So it's just a really cool human
Opportunity to bond with.

21:16.793 --> 21:19.448
Everybody in a way to step away
From the game for a little.

21:19.482 --> 21:21.034
While.

21:21.068 --> 21:22.068
Man.

21:22.103 --> 21:22.896
Yeah.

21:22.931 --> 21:23.941
That will wake you up in the
Morning.

21:23.965 --> 21:24.931
How is it?

21:24.965 --> 21:26.241
It's nice.

21:26.275 --> 21:26.793
It's a little cold.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.034
Okay.

21:28.068 --> 21:31.586
Just get clean.

21:31.620 --> 21:34.137
We've heard every girl's name
Mentioned as somebody who would.

21:34.172 --> 21:39.586
Be beatable in the end, like a
Girl to take to the end some.

21:39.620 --> 21:40.620
Here's the deal.

21:40.655 --> 21:42.931
I'm trying the figure out how to
Shape things up.

21:42.965 --> 21:43.620
I have an idea.

21:43.655 --> 21:44.137
Okay.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.344
We take out rick.

21:47.379 --> 21:50.103
I think wardog is worse than
Rick.

21:50.137 --> 21:52.310
I could see him winning the
Game.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.034
I think as long as wardog is
In the game, we have someone.

21:55.068 --> 21:56.000
That everyone can agree.

21:56.034 --> 22:01.724
I'm telling you... I trust you.

22:01.758 --> 22:03.034
I trust you.

22:03.068 --> 22:04.241
Ly not turn on you.

22:04.275 --> 22:07.068
Julie is talking about how
She wants wardog gone, but I.

22:07.103 --> 22:09.931
Don't know that's the smartest
Move.

22:09.965 --> 22:10.931
Thank you so much.

22:10.965 --> 22:12.310
Good job today.

22:12.344 --> 22:16.379
I think devens is much more
Dangerous than anyone else on.

22:16.413 --> 22:17.448
This beach.

22:17.482 --> 22:21.689
So now I have to convince people
To take rick out.

22:39.000 --> 22:47.000
Come on in, guys.

22:49.172 --> 22:50.034
All right.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.596
Let's get to today's immunity
Challenge.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.689
First things first, devens.

22:53.724 --> 22:54.551
Take back the necklace.

22:54.586 --> 23:00.862
All right.

23:00.896 --> 23:03.896
Once again immunity is back up
For grabs.

23:03.931 --> 23:07.068
For today's challenge we'll race
Over an obstacle carrying a.

23:07.103 --> 23:08.241
Buoy.

23:08.275 --> 23:11.068
You'll then maneuver a second
Buoy threw a long tunnel.

23:11.103 --> 23:13.862
Finally you'll gab your third
Buoy and fall under a net.

23:13.896 --> 23:16.586
You'll then use the keys
Attached to unlock a puzzle.

23:16.620 --> 23:23.413
First person to finish their
Star puzzle wins immunity,

23:23.448 --> 23:26.620
Guaranteed to see day 30.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.344
Losers tribal council where
Somebody will be the 12th.

23:29.379 --> 23:31.793
Person voted out of this game.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.068
We'll draw for spots.

23:33.103 --> 23:38.724
We'll get started.

23:38.758 --> 23:39.241
All right.

23:39.275 --> 23:40.827
Here we go.

23:40.862 --> 23:43.827
For immunity, survivors ready?

23:43.862 --> 23:45.827
Go!

23:45.862 --> 23:49.931
This first obstacle you cannot
Touch the ground in between.

23:49.965 --> 23:54.379
You have to jump from one to
Another.

23:54.413 --> 23:55.448
Everybody looking good.

23:55.482 --> 23:56.482
That's how you do it.

23:56.517 --> 23:58.965
Aurora is out first.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.793
Gavin is there.

24:03.827 --> 24:04.137
Devens.

24:04.172 --> 24:04.793
Lauren.

24:04.827 --> 24:05.379
Victoria.

24:05.413 --> 24:06.034
Wardog is through.

24:06.068 --> 24:07.206
Julie is over.

24:07.241 --> 24:11.344
Now you're maneuvering a second
Buoy.

24:11.379 --> 24:14.931
Ron working on that and he's got
It.

24:14.965 --> 24:22.000
Ron's good now.

24:22.034 --> 24:23.034
Aurora quickly through.

24:23.068 --> 24:24.137
Gavin on her tail.

24:24.172 --> 24:28.034
Julie is in it.

24:28.068 --> 24:28.724
Devens has his.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.965
He's through.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.655
Aurora working on that third
Buoy.

24:32.689 --> 24:34.827
She's got it.

24:34.862 --> 24:36.000
There goes gavin.

24:36.034 --> 24:42.034
Devens right on his tail.

24:42.068 --> 24:45.172
Devens is whipping through this
Third part of the challenge.

24:45.206 --> 24:49.620
It's now aurora and devens that
Are coming out at exactly the.

24:49.655 --> 24:50.896
Same moment.

24:50.931 --> 24:54.965
Now you got to use one of those
Three keys to unlock the lock,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.413
Holding your puzzle.

24:56.448 --> 24:57.620
Gavin is through.

24:57.655 --> 24:58.620
Wardog pushing.

24:58.655 --> 25:01.068
Here comes victoria.

25:01.103 --> 25:02.758
Lauren trying to get through
This.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.620
Julie is in it.

25:04.655 --> 25:07.344
Once you've got that lock open,
Get rid of it and start working.

25:07.379 --> 25:09.862
On the puzzling.

25:09.896 --> 25:12.482
Lauren is through.

25:12.517 --> 25:14.310
Here comes julie and ron.

25:14.344 --> 25:15.275
Everybody now with their puzzle.

25:15.310 --> 25:17.965
This is what you want on day 29.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.586
Everybody with a shot.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.137
Eight people left in this game.

25:22.172 --> 25:28.172
You want the make it to seven
And day 30, here's your chance.

25:28.206 --> 25:30.551
You are building a star puzzle.

25:30.586 --> 25:32.689
Everybody is looking for some
Clue.

25:32.724 --> 25:34.379
What is it about this puzzle?

25:34.413 --> 25:35.862
Is there a pattern?

25:35.896 --> 25:40.448
Is there something I can figure
Out that will help me solve it?

25:40.482 --> 25:44.689
I hate puzzles.

25:44.724 --> 25:46.965
Devens making a Little progress.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.034
Gavin's got some progress.

25:51.068 --> 25:52.241
Aurora is moving quickly.

25:52.275 --> 25:52.862
She's right.

25:52.896 --> 25:56.137
She's got something going.

25:56.172 --> 25:58.620
Gavin and devens have a few
Pieces in place.

25:58.655 --> 26:01.620
The question is, are they in the
Right place?

26:01.655 --> 26:04.689
Ron not much of anything yet.

26:04.724 --> 26:06.448
Julie nothing.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.379
Victoria nothing.

26:08.413 --> 26:09.551
Lauren not much.

26:09.586 --> 26:13.310
Wardog has a few pieces in
Place.

26:13.344 --> 26:16.482
It's aurora now with something.

26:16.517 --> 26:17.413
Come on.

26:17.448 --> 26:20.482
Devens continues,
Piece by piece.

26:20.517 --> 26:23.793
He's got something going and he
Knows it.

26:23.827 --> 26:27.034
Can anybody catch him now is the
Question?

26:27.068 --> 26:31.103
It is aurora and devens right
Now in the lead.

26:31.137 --> 26:39.137
Nobody else really close.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.034
Devens has hit a roadblock now.

26:44.068 --> 26:52.068
That opens the door for aurora.

26:57.655 --> 26:59.068
Aurora with another piece.

26:59.103 --> 26:59.965
Devens with another piece.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.068
Getting closer and closer.

27:01.103 --> 27:02.068
I got it.

27:02.103 --> 27:03.862
I got it.

27:03.896 --> 27:06.000
Devens has it.

27:06.034 --> 27:07.044
Individual immunity for devens.

27:07.068 --> 27:09.482
Safe tonight at tribal council.

27:09.517 --> 27:10.586
Wow.

27:10.620 --> 27:18.620
The pieces started going
Together fast.

27:23.827 --> 27:27.931
Devens, come on over.

27:27.965 --> 27:32.241
Second time in a row individual
Immunity, safe tonight at tribal.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.448
Council.

27:33.482 --> 27:35.389
As for the rest of you, tonight
Somebody will be the 12th.

27:35.413 --> 27:37.172
Person voted out of this game.

27:37.206 --> 27:38.448
Grab your stuff.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.068
Head back to camp.

27:39.103 --> 27:40.206
See you tonight at tribal.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.482
Congrats.

27:41.517 --> 27:43.044
Before the immunity challenge
We had this plan to get devens.

27:43.068 --> 27:46.724
Out, but as soon as rick wins,
It just snaps in my head, it's.

27:46.758 --> 27:47.689
Got to be wardog.

27:47.724 --> 27:50.000
People know the game wardog is
Playing.

27:50.034 --> 27:52.655
If he gets to the end, he will
Win this game.

27:52.689 --> 27:56.379
Hopefully people open their eyes
And see we have the get wardog.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.517
Out right now.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.793
Sayonara, wardog.

27:58.827 --> 28:01.827
I can't wait to see him go.

28:28.310 --> 28:31.310
I was so mad when rick con
Immunity today.

28:31.344 --> 28:32.724
I really wanted him out of here.

28:32.758 --> 28:34.034
He's such a threat.

28:34.068 --> 28:37.034
The more he sticks around, I
Think the more dangerous he.

28:37.068 --> 28:38.862
Becomes.

28:38.896 --> 28:39.862
Congratulations.

28:39.896 --> 28:41.206
Thanks, guys.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.965
You said you're not good at
Puzzles.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.275
I didn't think I was.

28:44.310 --> 28:51.275
Our plan was going to be that
Rick goes home, but rick is safe

28:51.310 --> 28:54.000
wardog and rick are the two
Big threats of game.

28:54.034 --> 28:57.206
One of the threats won immunity,
So maybe you vote the other one.

28:57.241 --> 28:57.862
Out.

28:57.896 --> 29:01.379
It can be as simple as that.

29:01.413 --> 29:03.965
I was freaking out this
Morning that it was going to be.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.758
Me.

29:04.793 --> 29:06.241
Want to go to the fire with Me.

29:06.275 --> 29:06.862
I would love that.

29:06.896 --> 29:09.068
Let's go.

29:09.103 --> 29:12.896
So devens won immunity.

29:12.931 --> 29:15.137
What about wardog?

29:15.172 --> 29:17.034
Don't forget.

29:17.068 --> 29:20.275
Wardog says that if all the
Threats in the game are gone,

29:20.310 --> 29:22.137
The next largest threat would
Go.

29:22.172 --> 29:25.310
If we take out wardog, that
Leaves me in the hot seat,

29:25.344 --> 29:26.700
Because I'm the next biggest
Threat.

29:26.724 --> 29:29.655
No matter what he says, he's
Going home.

29:29.689 --> 29:30.724
Here he comes.

29:30.758 --> 29:32.586
I have a tough decision to Make.

29:32.620 --> 29:36.517
Do I send home wardog with my
Vote and align with aurora,

29:36.551 --> 29:40.172
Victoria, or gavin, or if I
Choose, I can flip my vote and.

29:40.206 --> 29:43.413
Work with devens and wardog to
Vote for aurora and she would go.

29:43.448 --> 29:43.931
Home.

29:43.965 --> 29:44.689
That's a tough one.

29:44.724 --> 29:46.827
Ron, you want another Coconut?

29:46.862 --> 29:48.068
Thank you.

29:48.103 --> 29:51.413
With rick winning immunity,
I'm the biggest threat you can.

29:51.448 --> 29:52.689
Vote out right now.

29:52.724 --> 29:57.034
If victoria, gavin, julie, and
Aurora team up, they can take me.

29:57.068 --> 29:58.275
Out.

29:58.310 --> 30:02.103
So my strategy is to target
Aurora, because there's in love.

30:02.137 --> 30:03.379
Lost taking out aurora.

30:03.413 --> 30:06.689
She runs a big mouth, and she's
On the bottom.

30:06.724 --> 30:09.379
Not good for him to win
Immunity for us.

30:09.413 --> 30:10.344
It's not.

30:10.379 --> 30:13.482
If we don't work together.

30:13.517 --> 30:15.827
I'm out and you're out and
Neither one of us get.

30:15.862 --> 30:17.655
There we go with aurora now.

30:17.689 --> 30:18.034
Let's do it.

30:18.068 --> 30:18.689
Solid.

30:18.724 --> 30:19.310
Okay.

30:19.344 --> 30:20.931
What do you want to do?

30:20.965 --> 30:22.034
Take out aurora.

30:22.068 --> 30:23.172
Take out aurora?

30:23.206 --> 30:24.137
Yes.

30:24.172 --> 30:26.206
Why wouldn't you do this when
I said this?

30:26.241 --> 30:27.724
We can do it now.

30:27.758 --> 30:28.896
I talked with ron.

30:28.931 --> 30:31.896
I mean, why should I believe
You after the last vote?

30:31.931 --> 30:35.206
Well, the last vote, you were
Closer to kelley than I was.

30:35.241 --> 30:36.517
You would have told kelley.

30:36.551 --> 30:37.689
I couldn't tell you.

30:37.724 --> 30:38.379
That makes sense, right?

30:38.413 --> 30:40.448
So take out aurora?

30:40.482 --> 30:41.655
Yeah.

30:41.689 --> 30:46.931
If people are playing smart,
They go after wardog, but I'm.

30:46.965 --> 30:48.448
Banking on stupidity tonight.

30:48.482 --> 30:51.965
I think my dad is going to be
So impressed with my fire.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.068
Skills.

30:53.103 --> 30:56.862
I don't trust wardog, but maybe
His plan will work.

30:56.896 --> 30:59.068
It makes sense for my game.

30:59.103 --> 31:02.827
I have been pushing for aurora
To get voted out of this game.

31:02.862 --> 31:03.827
Forever.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.655
Maybe I could have a
Conversation with lauren.

31:06.689 --> 31:11.241
Wardog told me I was right
All along, aurora should go.

31:11.275 --> 31:17.034
Home, and you and me and rick
And ron take out aurora.

31:17.068 --> 31:21.137
I want to make sure we shouldn't
Take wardog out first.

31:21.172 --> 31:25.034
At least I mow the devil
We're working with when we're.

31:25.068 --> 31:25.931
Working with wardog.

31:25.965 --> 31:27.137
Right.

31:27.172 --> 31:29.827
I think we still take out
Aurora, then we are left with.

31:29.862 --> 31:33.034
The two of us and wardog.

31:33.068 --> 31:35.000
I don't know.

31:35.034 --> 31:36.068
I have to think about it.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.827
My god.

31:37.862 --> 31:39.896
The group wants the take out
Wardog.

31:39.931 --> 31:43.655
I would love revenge for kelley,
But I don't know if that's the.

31:43.689 --> 31:48.241
Best thing for me and my game.

31:48.275 --> 31:53.482
I'm trying not to be emotional
About it, but I'm really.

31:53.517 --> 31:54.724
Nervous.

31:54.758 --> 31:56.458
It's getting to the point now,
If I don't look to the future,

31:56.482 --> 32:01.310
If I don't set up my alliance,
If I don't get my ducks in a.

32:01.344 --> 32:05.379
Row, then I won't have a future.

32:05.413 --> 32:08.862
I know you've been having a
Lot of people pulling you aside.

32:08.896 --> 32:09.793
And things like that.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.896
It was wardog talking and me
Listening.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.896
I'm tired of wondering who I can
Really trust.

32:14.931 --> 32:16.000
You can trust me.

32:16.034 --> 32:20.482
I mean, I feel like I tried to
Show you the trust.

32:20.517 --> 32:22.413
The biggest thing I had, by
Giving you that.

32:22.448 --> 32:23.562
You didn't have to hand it back.

32:23.586 --> 32:25.344
I don't even question your
Trust.

32:25.379 --> 32:28.793
We are all threats in this Game.

32:28.827 --> 32:32.379
There's definitely concern that
Ron could be working with wardog.

32:32.413 --> 32:33.551
And rick.

32:33.586 --> 32:38.931
Ron is the one that is playing
Both sides, and he's done.

32:38.965 --> 32:40.862
Nothing but lie to me in this
Game.

32:40.896 --> 32:44.137
My advantage is an extra vote.

32:44.172 --> 32:48.689
And that definitely could come
In handy, especially because.

32:48.724 --> 32:52.310
Wardog and rick are not talking
To me.

32:52.344 --> 32:54.793
The only other time this
Happened is when my name is.

32:54.827 --> 32:55.655
Being written down.

32:55.689 --> 32:57.517
And that never feels good.

32:57.551 --> 33:00.448
And you would be crazy to say
That you feel comfortable,

33:00.482 --> 33:03.482
Because if you do, you're going
Home.

33:41.689 --> 33:49.689
We'll now bring in
The members of our jury.

33:51.724 --> 33:59.034
We'll now bring in
The members of our jury.

33:59.068 --> 34:03.000
So, wardog, what is the
Temperature become at camp?

34:03.034 --> 34:03.931
Is it friendly?

34:03.965 --> 34:05.034
Has it shifted?

34:05.068 --> 34:06.379
Do you sense paranoia?

34:06.413 --> 34:09.965
Yeah, as numbers get down,
There's less people you can.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.310
Point a finger at.

34:11.344 --> 34:13.424
Since everybody talks to
Everybody, it gets really thick.

34:13.447 --> 34:14.655
In the weeds out there.

34:14.688 --> 34:17.482
So I didn't realize it, but as
It gets smaller, the game gets.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.699
Much harder, even though there
Are less pieces to move around.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.137
Gaving, it looks like you had
A reaction.

34:22.172 --> 34:26.103
Yeah, wardog is saying
Everyone is talking to everyone,

34:26.137 --> 34:31.137
But we haven't spoken since the
Wentworth vote.

34:31.172 --> 34:33.965
After the comment he made a
Comment that I didn't like too.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.172
Much.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.665
He had the audacity to say,
If I had known you had the.

34:36.688 --> 34:38.896
Numbers, I would have been
Along.

34:38.931 --> 34:39.931
If I had known.

34:39.965 --> 34:42.516
There are two different ways
To approach it.

34:42.551 --> 34:46.620
There's talking to someone, but
I feel like wardog was talking.

34:46.655 --> 34:47.688
At me.

34:47.724 --> 34:49.320
I think that's the reason we
Haven't spoken since.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.137
Go, gavin.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.862
Devens, you could
Make a case that every tribal.

34:53.896 --> 34:57.000
Can be a turning point in that
There is no way to stop that.

34:57.034 --> 34:59.758
Ball that's rolling down the
Hill, which is great if you're.

34:59.793 --> 35:02.896
The one pushing, not so good if
You're the one that's about to.

35:02.931 --> 35:03.310
Roll over.

35:03.344 --> 35:04.413
Absolutely.

35:04.448 --> 35:07.413
The last returning player was
Voted out last tribal.

35:07.448 --> 35:10.310
The last several players have
Been really big targets.

35:10.344 --> 35:13.620
You do look around and go, which
Side of the ball am I on?

35:13.655 --> 35:16.827
Am I call up in this, or am I
Pushing?

35:16.862 --> 35:18.655
Every step is precarious right
Now.

35:18.689 --> 35:22.310
Wardog, do you agree
It's been a lot of big targets.

35:22.344 --> 35:23.896
That are now on the jury?

35:23.931 --> 35:25.034
Absolutely.

35:25.068 --> 35:26.965
Since the merge everyone is a
Big target.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.172
Does that concern You?

35:28.206 --> 35:29.241
Absolutely.

35:29.275 --> 35:31.689
I feel like my target has grown
A lot.

35:31.724 --> 35:34.206
First I've had to battle for 13
Days with david.

35:34.241 --> 35:38.379
And then wentworth, I felt like
She was preparing an end game.

35:38.413 --> 35:40.896
That didn't include me, so
Myself and ron put her out of.

35:40.931 --> 35:41.517
The game.

35:41.551 --> 35:43.482
So I got a big target.

35:43.517 --> 35:48.068
Wow, ron, very clever
Move like wardog just put you in.

35:48.103 --> 35:49.172
That cage right with him.

35:49.206 --> 35:50.724
Truthful.

35:50.758 --> 35:52.000
I was parted of it.

35:52.034 --> 35:55.482
You have to look around and see
Who the threats are and decide.

35:55.517 --> 35:58.034
When to make the move to remove
Them from this game.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.620
Victoria, very
Interesting what's happening.

36:00.655 --> 36:01.907
Tonight, people are working
Jury.

36:01.931 --> 36:04.689
One way you work a jury is by
Saying, I'm the one that played.

36:04.724 --> 36:08.137
You, so remember that when I'm
In the end, as though that is a.

36:08.172 --> 36:09.689
Badge of honor, which it can be.

36:09.724 --> 36:13.551
I think it really depends on
The kind of jury you have if.

36:13.586 --> 36:14.793
That works or not.

36:14.827 --> 36:18.103
Like wardog said and ron said,
The big targets right now are.

36:18.137 --> 36:20.827
The threats in the game, so if
You start bragging, hey, I got.

36:20.862 --> 36:23.896
This person, this person, this
Person out, look how great I am,

36:23.931 --> 36:26.896
Your tribe could find you as a
Threat, but if you don't start.

36:26.931 --> 36:29.620
Talking about it soon, the jury
Might not respect you.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.862
So gavin, three people now,
Wardog, ron, and victoria all.

36:32.896 --> 36:37.068
Say, yeah, the far... targets
Are the ones who are the biggest.

36:37.103 --> 36:38.275
Threats.

36:38.310 --> 36:40.286
That's the reason every one
Of those people are sitting.

36:40.310 --> 36:40.896
Over.

36:40.931 --> 36:41.862
There they were a threat.

36:41.896 --> 36:43.931
I think people saw them as
Winning this game.

36:43.965 --> 36:46.044
That's why they're over there
And some of us are still over.

36:46.068 --> 36:47.172
Here.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.310
Aurora, if we did an
Anonymous survey, would.

36:49.344 --> 36:52.551
Everybody agree who the threats
Are in this group of eight?

36:52.586 --> 36:53.862
Absolutely not.

36:53.896 --> 36:57.241
I think everything in this game
Is about perception.

36:57.275 --> 36:59.620
Each day it changes, and it's
Going to continue to change.

36:59.655 --> 37:04.344
The game is nowhere near over,
And there is no one threat.

37:04.379 --> 37:06.068
Lauren, how about for You?

37:06.103 --> 37:08.793
Is there a consensus among this
Eight who the real threats are?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.803
It depends on who you want to
Sit with at the end.

37:10.827 --> 37:14.758
Who I perceive as a threat julie
Might not see as a threat.

37:14.793 --> 37:16.586
It's really gray.

37:16.620 --> 37:20.965
Devens, what do you
Do to make sure you get out the.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.172
People you think are a threat,
Even though that may not line up.

37:24.206 --> 37:25.286
With what everybody else thinks?

37:25.310 --> 37:28.034
That's what's so precarious
About the game.

37:28.068 --> 37:31.448
Every opportunity a setback, and
Every setback is an opportunity.

37:31.482 --> 37:35.206
The last two tribals I fell like
I needed to win to stay safe,

37:35.241 --> 37:38.379
But every time you win, you
Think, no, am I too much of.

37:38.413 --> 37:39.551
A threat now.

37:39.586 --> 37:42.689
I feel like we're all queuing
Around camp like julie is

37:42.724 --> 37:44.724
Caesar.

37:44.758 --> 37:47.758
Everywhere we turn, there is a
Knife and what's up, man?

37:47.793 --> 37:48.758
Want to get some water.

37:48.793 --> 37:51.586
It's a scary time around camp.

37:51.620 --> 37:54.034
Ron, you sort of
Relish that idea that it could.

37:54.068 --> 37:56.931
Be everybody has a knife and
Everybody knows everybody has a.

37:56.965 --> 37:57.620
Knife?

37:57.655 --> 38:00.275
I don't like that actually.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.379
That's why I try to find people
Who I can trust.

38:02.413 --> 38:07.379
I don't want to get the et tu,
Brute in my back.

38:07.413 --> 38:09.527
I'm looking for true
Relationships, true people I can.

38:09.551 --> 38:12.103
Go to the end with and that
We're solid.

38:12.137 --> 38:14.931
Lauren, the irony of
Having a relationship you can.

38:14.965 --> 38:19.034
Trust is that everybody in that
Group believes they're the one.

38:19.068 --> 38:20.241
That will win.

38:20.275 --> 38:22.493
Yeah, if you tell me, you
Know, I want to go to the end.

38:22.517 --> 38:25.344
With you, then there is part of
You that thinks you can beat me.

38:25.379 --> 38:28.724
And if you think you can beat
Me, what am I missing?

38:28.758 --> 38:31.689
I think that's a very
Complicated relationship to.

38:31.724 --> 38:32.862
Balance.

38:32.896 --> 38:34.827
Aurora, that's a
Narrow balance beam the walk,

38:34.862 --> 38:35.620
What lauren just described.

38:35.655 --> 38:37.413
That's perfectly right.

38:37.448 --> 38:42.517
At this point I am used to
Things being up in the air.

38:42.551 --> 38:46.206
I think we all feel as though
Our plan is going forward, and I.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.079
Think some people are going to
Be surprised by the end of the.

38:48.103 --> 38:52.965
Night.

38:53.000 --> 38:53.517
Okay.

38:53.551 --> 38:54.862
It is time to vote.

38:54.896 --> 38:57.758
Victoria, you're up.

39:12.689 --> 39:18.482
See you later.

39:36.275 --> 39:44.275
I'll go tally the Votes.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.631
The anybody has a hidden
Immunity idol and you want the.

39:47.655 --> 39:55.241
Play it, now would be the time
To do so.

39:55.275 --> 39:55.965
Okay.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.931
I'll read the votes.

40:01.965 --> 40:06.586
First vote, aurora.

40:06.620 --> 40:10.310
Wardog.

40:10.344 --> 40:11.310
Aurora.

40:11.344 --> 40:18.724
That's two votes aurora.

40:18.758 --> 40:19.482
Wardog.

40:19.517 --> 40:20.310
We're tied.

40:20.344 --> 40:28.034
Two votes wardog, two votes
Aurora.

40:28.068 --> 40:28.655
Wardog.

40:28.689 --> 40:34.862
That's three votes wardog.

40:34.896 --> 40:42.896
That's four votes wardog, two
Votes aurora.

40:43.758 --> 40:46.275
12th person voted out and
The ninth member of our jury,

40:46.310 --> 40:46.931
Wardog.

40:46.965 --> 40:47.862
That's five, that's enough.

40:47.896 --> 40:50.896
You need to bring me your torch.

41:06.724 --> 41:09.620
Wardog, the tribe has spoken.

41:09.655 --> 41:11.517
You all made the right Decision.

41:11.551 --> 41:12.344
Good luck.

41:12.379 --> 41:14.862
Love you.

41:14.896 --> 41:15.793
Love you, wardog.

41:15.827 --> 41:18.827
Thank you, brother.

41:47.482 --> 41:48.689
Stay tuned for scenes.

41:48.724 --> 41:50.241
From our next episode.

41:54.689 --> 41:56.044
Access.Wgbh.Org
jeff Next time on.

41:56.068 --> 41:59.034
"Survivor," in a game of
Manipulation...

41:59.068 --> 42:00.206
it's a secret advantage.

42:00.241 --> 42:01.137
I'm going to give it to you.

42:01.172 --> 42:02.482
It's expired.

42:02.517 --> 42:03.448
He doesn't need to know that.

42:03.482 --> 42:05.206
You can't trust Anyone.

42:05.241 --> 42:07.551
Why you looking in my bag?

42:07.586 --> 42:09.137
Except family.

42:09.172 --> 42:10.379
Challenge is good to go.

42:10.413 --> 42:14.517
All we're missing are the loved
Ones.

42:14.551 --> 42:17.000
Ultimately it came down to
Ron tonight.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.586
Ron did well, because I would
Have voted me out, too.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.379
So I'm at the edge of extinction
Right now.

42:21.413 --> 42:24.000
Don't know how long I'll be
Here, but I I can handle it.

42:24.034 --> 42:25.172
Regrets happen.

42:25.206 --> 42:30.172
Every day you're here you're
Closer to winning the game.

42:30.206 --> 42:32.286
Listen, dude, you can bet
Your rear end you're going to.

42:32.310 --> 42:35.310
Get it from me tomorrow, just so
You know.
