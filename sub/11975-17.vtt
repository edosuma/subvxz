10:45.567 --> 10:48.600
go on some month-long vacation,
I realize that Kourtney and I

10:48.600 --> 10:52.333
aren't together, but we do
spend, like, every day together

10:52.333 --> 10:55.700
with the kids.
It does feel like a very, very

10:55.700 --> 10:58.333
long time.
She's just annoying.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.833
She's just so rude.
Like...

10:59.833 --> 11:02.033
let me
find out and tell you the day

11:02.033 --> 11:05.133
- before.
- She's just playing with

11:05.133 --> 11:09.233
- you.
- No, she's not.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.533
Ooh, let me see what's
popping.

11:11.533 --> 11:14.333
- Pop that bad boy in here.
- I'm thinking, okay,

11:14.333 --> 11:16.300
well, maybe I want to get my
boobs done.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.833
- Ooh.
- Oh!

11:17.833 --> 11:21.533
- Shake and bake.
- This is an awards show.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.833
- Comfortable is for daytime.
- Oh, no ring?

11:23.833 --> 11:25.300
- No, just...
- What if I wear the

11:25.300 --> 11:26.500
- ring on this side?
- You're

11:26.500 --> 11:27.767
- overaccessorizing.
- Just this and that.

11:27.767 --> 11:28.967
- Overaccessorizing.
- Yeah.

11:28.967 --> 11:29.967
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:29.967 --> 11:32.667
She's so pissed that,
like, Kim was dressing Caitlyn

11:32.667 --> 11:34.800
for the ESPYs.
Like, she's, like, really upset

11:34.800 --> 11:36.467
- about it.
- "Not loyal."

11:36.467 --> 11:39.233
I want to tell Kim,
you know, Mom's really upset

11:39.233 --> 11:45.167
with you.
Like, Mom's pissed.

11:51.033 --> 11:54.167
Your last
fragrance launch was in 2014.

11:54.167 --> 11:57.267
So, critical time right now to
really build a brand-new

11:57.267 --> 11:58.800
- signature.
Mm-hmm.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.467
You've evolved.
You've changed.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.733
Yeah, I think new name,
new logo.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.100
- Yeah, we should.
- Like, it could be Kim

12:04.100 --> 12:06.100
Kardashian West, you know,
instead of...

12:06.100 --> 12:07.267
- Yeah.
- With a new logo and,

12:07.267 --> 12:08.433
- like...
- That's great.

12:08.433 --> 12:09.600
- Absolutely.
- So, everyone will know,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.700
like, the Kim Kardashian stuff
and Kim Kardashian West is all,

12:12.700 --> 12:16.100
like, the new stuff.
I am so excited to relaunch my

12:16.100 --> 12:18.633
fragrance.
It's, like, a whole new team,

12:18.633 --> 12:21.600
and I just loved working on all
of my fragrances before and I'm

12:21.600 --> 12:24.933
excited to have a new one.
I mean, I love, like, obviously,

12:24.933 --> 12:27.400
Elizabeth Taylor and what she's
done with her fragrance business

12:27.400 --> 12:29.067
- even, you know.
- Yes, it's

12:29.067 --> 12:30.367
- tremendous business. Yes.
- You know, after her

12:30.367 --> 12:31.700
- passing.
- Yo.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.867
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.267
What's, uh, what's
happening over here at this big

12:34.267 --> 12:35.667
table?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.133
Our big business
meeting.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.500
- Fragrance meeting.
- Fragrance meeting.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.833
Oh, it smells good in
here.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.367
I was kidding.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.067
- It's the pastries.
- Well put.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.467
If you're nice to me, I
might do a Scott Disick men's

12:47.467 --> 12:49.333
- cologne.
- I'd love to get

12:49.333 --> 12:52.533
something, that, uh, says, "I
like you, but still  off,

12:52.533 --> 12:54.800
at the same time."

12:54.800 --> 12:56.733
- Okay.
- Wait, what are you

12:56.733 --> 12:58.133
doing?
I thought we were going to

12:58.133 --> 13:00.000
- hangout today?
- Were we?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.033
Yeah.
Whatever. I mean, it's cool.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.733
I'll just wait for a little bit.
Kourtney and the kids just left

13:04.733 --> 13:06.800
town a couple of days ago.
And it already feels like

13:06.800 --> 13:09.600
they've been gone about a year.
It's definitely difficult.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.033
I mean, I'm used to seeing my
kids every single day.

13:12.033 --> 13:14.400
Any time I have too much time on
my hands, I'm not exactly sure

13:14.400 --> 13:16.333
what to do.
So it's hard.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.733
I mean, I feel really
bad I have so many meetings.

13:18.733 --> 13:21.133
- Can we, uh...
- I thought you said

13:21.133 --> 13:23.333
yesterday we'll go run around.
Go to Maria's.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.200
I know, but I totally
forgot.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.867
Please don't be mad at me.
Please, please.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.600
I'm not mad.
It just, it felt like you made

13:28.600 --> 13:30.267
- plans.
- I know, but this house

13:30.267 --> 13:31.967
- meeting came up.
- All right. Bye.

13:31.967 --> 13:39.967
Bye.♪ ♪

13:39.967 --> 13:42.700
I've just got to
tailor up some jeans.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.700
- Okay.
- 'Cause I'm so thin.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.033
You are too skinny;
please stop.

13:48.033 --> 13:49.733
And because I'm so
thin, I don't have boobies

13:49.733 --> 13:51.667
anymore.
Probably want to get boobs one

13:51.667 --> 13:53.633
- day.
- Really? I'm obsessed

13:53.633 --> 13:55.900
with your boobs.
I don't think you need boobs.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.500
And you have that bra that
literally makes your boobs...

13:58.500 --> 14:00.267
I know, but not
everyone wants to wear a bra all

14:00.267 --> 14:02.167
the time.
I thought about getting my boobs

14:02.167 --> 14:04.900
done for years.
Never really that serious about

14:04.900 --> 14:08.033
it, because I've always had
somewhat decent sized boobs.

14:08.033 --> 14:10.567
But now I'm thinking, okay,
well, maybe I want to get my

14:10.567 --> 14:13.567
boobs done.
I got these-- do you know they

14:13.567 --> 14:15.900
sell these with nipples?
I don't want big boobs, I just

14:15.900 --> 14:18.033
want...
Oh... my God.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.967
Hi.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.767
What are you holding
on, there?

14:21.767 --> 14:23.533
Monica and I were just
talking about boobs.

14:23.533 --> 14:25.267
Those are nice boobs,
man.

14:25.267 --> 14:26.700
You came in to a
really good conversation.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.800
You really scared me.
I want more, like, full-- what

14:28.800 --> 14:30.667
is it-- like, full
circumference.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.167
But you are a "C."
You want a little more

14:32.167 --> 14:33.633
- side boob.
- No, I'm really a "B"

14:33.633 --> 14:35.533
- now.
- If you're gonna be so

14:35.533 --> 14:37.633
bottom-heavy, you got to be top,
too.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.000
Right. Like, don't you
think I need bigger boobs?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.667
Yeah.
She's like a big booty ho video

14:40.667 --> 14:42.667
- vixen.
- Yeah.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.333
She needs to be up
and popping.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.733
Well, let's try the
dress on.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.100
- Yeah.
- Let's get those

14:47.100 --> 14:50.667
titties popping.♪ ♪

14:50.667 --> 14:57.200
Ooh, let me see what's popping.
Oh! Getting them titties on.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.200
Where's the other one?
Give it to me.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.267
Pop that bad boy in
here.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.867
Now that's proportional.
Pow, pow!

15:03.867 --> 15:06.100
But, Scott, you don't
think my butt shrunk?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.633
I mean, it's still out
there and living the dream.

15:08.633 --> 15:12.067
I have these.
That's kind of just-- put it on

15:12.067 --> 15:14.300
the side, so it just gives it a
little...

15:14.300 --> 15:17.333
- Oh!
- Ooh. Shake and bake.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.367
Scott, that's very
inappropriate.

15:19.367 --> 15:20.967
I want to make sure
that you're good.

15:20.967 --> 15:23.800
I know how you like it rough.
I don't think it looks bad the

15:23.800 --> 15:25.667
- way it is, Khlo.
- I have fake boobs in

15:25.667 --> 15:27.500
- here right now.
- Like I said, I don't

15:27.500 --> 15:29.900
- think it looks bad.
- Look, if you saw me at

15:29.900 --> 15:31.767
a wedding like this, would you
be like...

15:31.767 --> 15:33.200
If you were with a
date or without a date?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.533
No, either-- would you
be like...

15:34.533 --> 15:35.900
Either way, I'd be
like, "Damn!"

15:35.900 --> 15:37.467
..."I wish that bitch
was on my arm."

15:37.467 --> 15:39.200
On my , not
arm.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.867
- Okay.
- You are not allowed

15:40.867 --> 15:42.833
- at my fittings anymore.
- Monica, I love you,

15:42.833 --> 15:44.667

job.

Oh, my God!

15:51.167 --> 15:53.167
- Kim K.
- Hi, guys.

15:53.167 --> 15:55.100
Do you like these
boobs?

15:55.100 --> 15:56.967
Why on earth would you
want to get your boobs done?

15:56.967 --> 15:59.700
I think it like, so suits you
and fits you.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.100
Do you know how much
of a confidence-builder this is?

16:02.100 --> 16:04.200
What are you doing in
here?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.567
This-- Kourtney-- this is, like,
really inappropriate.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.633
- For who, Khloe or me?
- Both of you.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.000
Scott and I do this
all the time.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.267
Obviously, these implants are
not the real thing, but I love

16:15.267 --> 16:17.233
- the way they look.
- Wow. Now you're

16:17.233 --> 16:19.100
talking.
Get the-- but you got to hold

16:19.100 --> 16:20.533
them up, right.
So all of a sudden you can dance

16:20.533 --> 16:21.900
like a stripper.
Get it, girl.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.667
Show me what you're working
with.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.467
Should I try to go up
here?

16:33.467 --> 16:35.233
I've never been this way.
I just want to experiment.

16:35.233 --> 16:37.333
But do you know where
you're going?

16:37.333 --> 16:39.300
Oh, don't tell me
there's a lot of traffic right

16:39.300 --> 16:41.867
here.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.533
- Hi.
- Kimmy.

16:44.533 --> 16:49.400
- Caitlyn.
- Baby, how ya doin'?

16:49.400 --> 16:52.433
Good. I'm just riding
around town with Khloe.

16:52.433 --> 16:55.500
- Hey, Cait.
- Baby, I haven't seen

16:55.500 --> 16:58.400
- you in forever.
- Yeah, um, we texted

16:58.400 --> 17:01.133
- the other day.
- Oh, just briefly.

17:01.133 --> 17:04.500
- Briefly, yeah.
- But anyway, Kim, I

17:04.500 --> 17:06.833
- got a, uh, a request.
- Yeah?

17:06.833 --> 17:08.533
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

17:08.533 --> 17:11.100
All right.
I got to do the ESPYs next week.

17:11.100 --> 17:15.700
I was thinking, why don't I give
Kim a call and see what she

17:15.700 --> 17:17.967
- would come up with?
- Okay.

17:17.967 --> 17:20.633
I can definitely help you find
something.

17:20.633 --> 17:24.233
I know how important the ESPYs
are to Caitlyn, so, of course, I

17:24.233 --> 17:27.100
want to help her pick out an
outfit.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.033
I've always said, just make sure
you represent and dress

17:30.033 --> 17:32.700
- appropriately.
- The ESPYs, you can

17:32.700 --> 17:34.967
do any...
You can go formal, full-length.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.967
Basically, anything that you
want to do.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.867
Okay.
I will figure it out.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.733
Oh!
We're working together.

17:40.733 --> 17:46.400
Kim Kardashian, my stylist.
Next time, Khloe, you can do it.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.533
- Okay.
- I'm a little more

17:49.533 --> 17:52.900
- ratchet than... than Kim is.
- I love that.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.733
Okay.

17:55.733 --> 17:58.200
All right. I'll talk

17:58.200 --> 18:00.100
- to you guys later.
- Okay, bye.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.800
- Bye.
- Love you. Bye.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.233
She has no idea what
ratchet is.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.567
- No clue.
- No clue.

18:14.167 --> 18:18.133
Whoa. Is this like a
whole workout room?

18:18.133 --> 18:21.867
Dude, this place is no joke.
I'm getting buff over here.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.367
I didn't know you even
knew how to do that.

18:24.367 --> 18:28.233
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be huge by the time I

18:28.233 --> 18:31.733
leave here.
That toilet doesn't look, like,

18:31.733 --> 18:34.033
- super comfy.
- It is.

18:34.033 --> 18:35.633
- Is it?
- Why are you, like,

18:35.633 --> 18:38.433
going through everything?
Ever since Kourt has left town

18:38.433 --> 18:41.567
with the kids, Scott has been
over quite a bit.

18:41.567 --> 18:44.000
And it's a little stressful.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.800
Let me ask you a
question.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.133
You got to get rid of some of
this.

18:48.133 --> 18:50.533
Why don't you throw this bad boy
up there?

18:50.533 --> 18:52.400
No, no, 'cause those
two go together as a piece.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.667
What do you mean?
As a horse and carriage?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.033
Holy , this thing is
heavy.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.933
It's real.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.467
No, no. No, no.

19:03.467 --> 19:04.900
- It stands up.
- Where is it supposed

19:04.900 --> 19:06.633
- to go?
- Stand. Yeah.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.300
I just broke at least
a hundred dollar's worth of

19:08.300 --> 19:09.867
- this thing.
- Okay.

19:09.867 --> 19:14.900
No, no. I got it.
You, literally, are no help.

19:14.900 --> 19:18.033
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Nope. No more touching.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.067
There's a lot of fun
stuff in here.

19:20.067 --> 19:23.067
Oh, my God.
Is this table not

19:23.067 --> 19:25.233
really centered to the TV, or
it's centered to the wall?

19:25.233 --> 19:28.067
Centered to the
thing, I don't know.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.800
- It's centered to something.
- What the?

19:30.800 --> 19:32.833
I can't handle this right now.
Seriously, what else is wrong

19:32.833 --> 19:34.167
- with this room?
- Wait. Let me just, let

19:34.167 --> 19:35.567
- me just fix it.
- No. For what?

19:35.567 --> 19:37.333
- Here's the  edge.
- What the  do you want me

19:37.333 --> 19:38.933
- to do?
- Okay, all right, here.

19:38.933 --> 19:40.400
How about this?
How about you look down and take

19:40.400 --> 19:42.100
- a look at the speakers?
- No. I don't give...

19:42.100 --> 19:43.433
And then look at that
side, and then look at that

19:43.433 --> 19:44.833
- side.
- I've been fine here

19:44.833 --> 19:46.467
- for how long?
- That speakers half

19:46.467 --> 19:47.800
- closed and that's not.
-  that because

19:47.800 --> 19:49.133
you're  stressing
me out.

19:49.133 --> 19:51.267
So, no. We're not doing that
anymore.

19:51.267 --> 19:52.600
I'd be stressed out,
too, if my table was sideways.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.367
I love Scott, and I
want to be there for him, and I

19:55.367 --> 19:58.600
want to support him, but he has
got to stop touching my.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.933
Because I just want to kill him.
Like, I am too OCD for this.

20:01.933 --> 20:04.800
Clearly, he has no idea what to
do with his time.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.600
You have got to get out.
Whore. Boring.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.667
It really is a tougher
way to live.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.533
Khloe doesn't get how hard it is
to work out when you have big

20:14.533 --> 20:16.667
boobs bouncing around
everywhere.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.967
- So how was it?
- Neutral wasn't what

20:18.967 --> 20:21.867
I signed up for.
That's what you don't get.

20:21.867 --> 20:31.133
And I'm not going to
play this game anymore.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.600
Is this a hairless
peach?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.300
You're asking me if
that's a hairless peach?

20:42.300 --> 20:43.733
- Well...
- What do you think I'm

20:43.733 --> 20:45.267
gonna think about?
This one went and got a

20:45.267 --> 20:47.600
Brazilian.
This is obviously a nectarine.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.267
How the  was I
supposed to know that?

20:49.267 --> 20:50.767
- What's the difference?
- Obviously, you're not

20:50.767 --> 20:52.433
- a fruit specialist.
- Wait, I've got a...

20:52.433 --> 20:53.800
- Oh, my God.
- You're gonna Google a

20:53.800 --> 20:56.233
- nectarine?
- Nectarine versus

20:56.233 --> 20:59.967
peaches.
A peach and a nectarine are very

20:59.967 --> 21:02.033
similar.
Genetically, there's not much

21:02.033 --> 21:04.633
difference between the two.
The main difference is that a

21:04.633 --> 21:07.500
peach has fuzz on its skin,
while a nectarine does not.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.200
- I'm not an idiot.
- Oh, wait, nectarines

21:09.200 --> 21:11.200
are a bit more likely to be
affected by diseases, such as

21:11.200 --> 21:13.233
- brown rot and bacterial spots.
- The nectarine?

21:13.233 --> 21:14.933
Well, it's 'cause it's got no
bush.

21:14.933 --> 21:16.800
Right.
There's nothing to protect it.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.333
Right. You wonder why
in the '80s the girls weren't

21:18.333 --> 21:20.067
getting STDs like they were
today.

21:20.067 --> 21:21.933
You know, this is

21:21.933 --> 21:24.267
gonna be like the longest I'm
away from the kids and Kourt

21:24.267 --> 21:27.100
- ever.
- How do you feel?

21:27.100 --> 21:29.733
Oh, I'm kind of
anxious, and I'm supposed to do

21:29.733 --> 21:32.433
some appearances.
I just feel like I, like, want

21:32.433 --> 21:34.733
to book my time, so like, I
don't think about missing the

21:34.733 --> 21:36.267
kids and Kourtney.
But at the same time...

21:36.267 --> 21:37.767
But are you gonna be
on your best behavior?

21:37.767 --> 21:39.867
- Worse!
- Oh, my God.

21:39.867 --> 21:41.767
- You probably are.
- Well, I mean, it's

21:41.767 --> 21:44.400
hard to be on amazing behavior
when you're at a nightclub or at

21:44.400 --> 21:46.300
- a party.
- Just make sure you're

21:46.300 --> 21:48.967
doing whatever you think is
best.

21:48.967 --> 21:51.333
Well, I usually would
do it strictly 'cause of money.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.967
- Right.
- 'Cause I like money.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.633
So, do you need the
money?

21:54.633 --> 21:56.333
I could probably make
money other ways that are

21:56.333 --> 21:58.267
- healthier.
- Why don't you try that

21:58.267 --> 22:01.267
first?
You could go into your hobby of

22:01.267 --> 22:03.267
- flipping houses.
- I could work on my

22:03.267 --> 22:05.900
houses.
I'm still gonna miss the kids.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.867
I just feel like if went to
Europe and I did some parties, I

22:07.867 --> 22:09.867
probably would totally not think
about anything.

22:09.867 --> 22:12.633
Kourt and the kids
have been gone about a week now.

22:12.633 --> 22:16.500
In the past, when Scott had down
time, he would book parties and

22:16.500 --> 22:19.700
club appearances, and nothing
good every came out of that.

22:19.700 --> 22:23.567
So for him to even be thinking
of booking a club appearance

22:23.567 --> 22:27.200
again really has me worried.
Think it through, and don't just

22:27.200 --> 22:34.533
do it 'cause you're bored.♪ ♪

22:34.533 --> 22:36.533
That one's, like, a
little too big.

22:36.533 --> 22:38.733
I don't think you'd want to go
that size.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.333
Which one?
This one or this one?

22:41.333 --> 22:45.100
Let me see them both.
This one feels heavier, but the

22:45.100 --> 22:50.133
shape might be better.
The one on the left looks, like,

22:50.133 --> 22:53.767
bigger.
That's all you've ever wanted is

22:53.767 --> 22:56.933
- cleavage.
- And that... that's

22:56.933 --> 22:58.933
- amazing.
- That's, like, huge.

22:58.933 --> 23:01.367
- That's amazing, right?
- You would never go that

23:01.367 --> 23:03.533
- big, would you?
- You talkin' to me?

23:03.533 --> 23:05.533
- Yeah.
- Totally like an

23:05.533 --> 23:07.600
Instagram whore.
Whore.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.733
- Boring.
- It really is a tougher

23:09.733 --> 23:11.733
- way to live.
- Oh, my God, I'm

23:11.733 --> 23:14.333
finally you.

23:14.333 --> 23:20.133
- Oh... my... God!
- I mean, Khloe looks

23:20.133 --> 23:23.300
beautiful no matter what.
I love small boobs, but, like,

23:23.300 --> 23:26.300
I've always had big boobs.
I think Khloe doesn't get how

23:26.300 --> 23:29.567
hard it is to work out when you
really have, like, big boobs,

23:29.567 --> 23:31.533
like, bouncing around
everywhere.

23:31.533 --> 23:33.500
So I wanted to work out with
Khloe so that she can really

23:33.500 --> 23:35.933
- test out her bigger boobs.
- How's everybody body

23:35.933 --> 23:37.933
- feeling?
- Fabulous.

23:37.933 --> 23:39.600
Really tired.
All right, what are we doing

23:39.600 --> 23:41.433
- today?
- Let's start here on the

23:41.433 --> 23:43.167
ball for the warm-up.
Just get some blood flow

23:43.167 --> 23:46.033
right now.
Pull it, knee up, drop. Good.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.600
- Two up. Three up.
- Look at how big my boobs

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
- look from the side.
- Do a little jump up this

23:50.600 --> 23:53.600
time.
Up, two, up. Good.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.533
I've always wanted,
like, cleavage in a sports bra.

23:56.533 --> 23:59.933
Like, I love those girls at the
gym that just got big ol' boobs.

23:59.933 --> 24:03.000
And I never really have that.
So, I'm digging this whole

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
- cleavage-in-a-sports-bra thing.
- Nine, eight...

24:05.000 --> 24:06.833
My God, you're way
heavier than usual.

24:06.833 --> 24:08.800
- ...seven, six, five...
- Shut up.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.567
- It's the boobs.
- I do feel like the

24:10.567 --> 24:13.567
boobs pass the test.
So, I don't feel like it hurts

24:13.567 --> 24:17.700
to go get a consultation, see
what my options are, and just to

24:17.700 --> 24:21.300
see, like, how serious I am
about this whole boob job thing.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.400
I mean, we're in L.A.
I feel like people get their

24:24.400 --> 24:27.033
boobs done like they fill up a
car with gas.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.067
- Don, thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.633
So how was it?
Really different, right?

24:31.633 --> 24:34.067
No, not that
different, but, you know...

24:34.067 --> 24:43.000
we'll see.♪ ♪

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Just want to walk
through it?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.833
Yeah, let's just go
through it.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.700
Okay.
This has head-on city light

24:48.700 --> 24:51.000
views, it's got about a 180
degree view.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.300
It's a mid-century house.
They've owned it for about 52

24:53.300 --> 24:55.133
years.
You've got really high ceilings

24:55.133 --> 24:56.967
in here.
I mean, once they get everything

24:56.967 --> 24:58.800
out, you'll be able to see,
but...

24:58.800 --> 25:00.633
Yeah, the views are
crazy.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.300
This is nice out here.
The view and the land and how

25:02.300 --> 25:04.433
private it is and the private
street is what makes it.

25:04.433 --> 25:07.800
I'm happy that Khloe gave me
that little push just to

25:07.800 --> 25:10.700
remember that I got to work,
instead of doing all these club

25:10.700 --> 25:13.567
gigs, because it's not the best
thing in the world for me.

25:13.567 --> 25:15.567
Big pool, big view.
And you'd have the whole yard

25:15.567 --> 25:17.400
here.
And then all this just needs to

25:17.400 --> 25:21.233
be redone.
Everything needs to slide.

25:21.233 --> 25:24.600
It has potential.
I think in the past, it was very

25:24.600 --> 25:27.800
difficult for me to be positive
with my time if I wasn't

25:27.800 --> 25:30.533
spending time with my kids.
But now I realize that they are

25:30.533 --> 25:32.533
the most important thing in my
life.

25:32.533 --> 25:34.467
And there's gonna be times
when they're gone, and I'm gonna

25:34.467 --> 25:37.000
need to fill my time with
positive things.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.833
- How are you feeling?
- I feel good.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.500
I mean, I miss the kids, and I
miss Kourtney, but I feel good.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.333
- Good.
- As long as I'm

25:42.333 --> 25:44.200
thinking about work and, like,
you know, pounding the

25:44.200 --> 25:46.233
- pavement...
- Pounding the pavement.

25:46.233 --> 25:48.000
...I feel fine, and
I'm happy.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.633
And I love houses, and I love
decorating, so it's, like, I'm

25:49.633 --> 25:51.400
excited, and it's a lot better
than sitting in a night club all

25:51.400 --> 25:53.200
- night.
- Yeah, it's like a

25:53.200 --> 25:54.833
- whole... it's a whole shebang.
- It's a whole

25:54.833 --> 25:56.833
- shabooble.
- Shabooble.

25:56.833 --> 26:07.367
This is just like a
booba-aloosk.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.400
- Look who it is.
- Hello!

26:09.400 --> 26:12.400
- My little girl!
- Hi.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.233
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

26:14.233 --> 26:15.767
How are you doing?
I appreciate, Michael, you

26:15.767 --> 26:17.433
coming through in very short
notice. It was only what?

26:17.433 --> 26:19.267
That's what Michael
does, you know?

26:19.267 --> 26:21.100
A week and...
That's what he does.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.900
So, let's, um... let's
get started.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.733
Yeah. I say we try
some clothes on.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.667
Tonight is the night of
the ESPYs so Michael Costello

26:26.667 --> 26:29.367
and I are gonna go through all
of the outfits with Caitlyn just

26:29.367 --> 26:32.800
to make sure that she has the
perfect look and we get her out

26:32.800 --> 26:35.633
- the door looking amazing.
- Are you ready?

26:35.633 --> 26:37.467
- We're ready.
- Should we let

26:37.467 --> 26:39.133
- Snapchatters pick your outfit?
- All right, now this

26:39.133 --> 26:40.933
is a very Kim dress.
This is what I would call this--

26:40.933 --> 26:42.933
- a Kim...
- Yes!

26:42.933 --> 26:44.967
- Well?
- Should we Snapchat?

26:44.967 --> 26:46.767
Yeah, I just don't
have the Snapchat thing going.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.767
Yeah. I could do it.
Let me shoot it and then see if

26:48.767 --> 26:50.767
- we like it.
- See what it looks

26:50.767 --> 26:52.567
- like.
- Turn around and we'll

26:52.567 --> 26:54.400
make the train perfect.
At the count of three, start

26:54.400 --> 26:57.800
walking into the room.
One, two, three.

26:57.800 --> 27:03.333
Go!
This could be an option!

27:03.333 --> 27:04.967
You'll like this
one-- the white one that she's

27:04.967 --> 27:06.800
- gonna try on.
- Are you ready?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.867
- I'm ready.
- Yes.

27:08.867 --> 27:13.133
Wow!

27:13.133 --> 27:15.033
- Go for this.
- I know you like the

27:15.033 --> 27:16.900
- black one.
- Wear whatever makes you

27:16.900 --> 27:18.567
- feel the most comfortable...
- I feel comfortable

27:18.567 --> 27:20.500
- in this.
- ...and the prettiest.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.133
- Yeah. I like this.
- Sorry to be annoying,

27:22.133 --> 27:23.933
but do you have underwear on?
'Cause you see the underwear.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.933
- Oh, you need that.
- What?

27:25.933 --> 27:27.767
No, it's fine if you
need it. I was just saying...

27:27.767 --> 27:29.400
Yeah. I know.
We can... we can play with that.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.233
I was just saying, that
line.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.000
- Yeah.
- Just cut a little bit in

27:33.000 --> 27:34.567
the back or a little bit on the
sides just to not, like, dig in.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.400
No. I can wear
different ones.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.167
Let me take these off, and we'll
get there.

27:38.167 --> 27:39.967
And what shoes are you
planning on wearing?

27:39.967 --> 27:41.567
Well, I'm gonna wear
these just because I don't have

27:41.567 --> 27:44.400
- any...
- Why? No. Let me look.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.233
I don't have any
that are...

27:46.233 --> 27:47.933
- Let me look.
- I got to walking

27:47.933 --> 27:49.800
around so much, these are
comfortable.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.467
This is an awards show.
You have to step it up.

27:51.467 --> 27:53.833
- Comfortable is for day time.
- My only option...

27:53.833 --> 27:55.267
Dancing
with the Stars.

27:55.267 --> 27:57.800
Just try one on each foot.
Why do you own them if you won't

27:57.800 --> 27:59.800
wear them?
This is the event.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.633
This is the time you're gonna
wear them. Roll your eyes.

28:01.633 --> 28:03.467
Did you show Kim the
jewelry?

28:03.467 --> 28:05.267
Where did the ring
go?

28:05.267 --> 28:06.900
- I'm wearing it.
- No, we're not doing the

28:06.900 --> 28:08.767
- ring.
- Oh. No ring?

28:08.767 --> 28:10.767
- No. Just...
- No ring.

28:10.767 --> 28:12.500
What if I wear
the ring on this side?

28:12.500 --> 28:14.033
- You overaccessorizing.
- No. This and that.

28:14.033 --> 28:15.800
- Overaccessorizing.
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.533
- Okay.
- Caitlyn is just not used

28:17.533 --> 28:19.367
to really putting whole looks
together all the time.

28:19.367 --> 28:23.100
Or maybe she's so excited that
she finally has the chance to

28:23.100 --> 28:25.100
wear every accessory under the
sun.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.100
But she needs to, like, tone it
down.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.033
The final look!
Are you ready?

28:30.033 --> 28:32.033
- Yay!
- Yes!

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
Get that off.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.100
Don't you like the
crown?

28:38.100 --> 28:40.133
- I love it.
- I love it.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.967
- Oh.
- All right, let's

28:41.967 --> 28:43.800
take it off.
I know. It was so good, too.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.700
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you, babe.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.533
I still don't cosign
the shoes.

28:47.533 --> 28:49.400
- It's gonna be okay.
- Beautiful.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.833
- Are we ready?
- We're ready.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.167
- Let's do the ESPYs!
- Bye.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.133
Bye.

29:00.033 --> 29:01.867
This is, like, double
hotness.

29:01.867 --> 29:03.700
- How are you?
- I feel like I died and

29:03.700 --> 29:05.533
- went to heaven.
- It's your lucky day.

29:05.533 --> 29:07.367
You want to go in and
not stand in the doorway?

29:07.367 --> 29:09.200
- Yeah. Oh, um, yeah.
- I'm the dental

29:09.200 --> 29:11.033
- assistant.
- Well, I can see you've

29:11.033 --> 29:14.033
been very active lately.

29:14.033 --> 29:16.633
Wait. You can tell
that through someone's teeth?

29:16.633 --> 29:18.633
Uh-uh.
- Um, yeah.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.633
What's this little hair right
here?

29:20.633 --> 29:22.633
Uh...

29:22.633 --> 29:24.467
Okay, I'm gonna send
in the cleaner.

29:24.467 --> 29:26.300
- McGolly?
- Send in the...

29:26.300 --> 29:28.733
send in the cleaner.

29:28.733 --> 29:32.300
Oh.
Wait. Look what my mom sent me.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.633
She's so pissed that, like, Kim
was dressing Caitlyn for the

29:34.633 --> 29:36.633
ESPYs.
Like, she's, like, really upset

29:36.633 --> 29:38.633
- about it.
- Are you kidding?

29:38.633 --> 29:41.167
"Not loyal."
No. Read hashtag.

29:41.167 --> 29:44.000
"#notloyal."
"Mom, do not write to me in

29:44.000 --> 29:46.567
hashtags."

29:46.567 --> 29:48.400
I was literally, like,
"Who texts this?"

29:48.400 --> 29:50.033
Okay, you're such a
jerk for not addressing the real

29:50.033 --> 29:52.033
- problem.
- I was like...

29:52.033 --> 29:53.733
The first thing you
say is, "Mom don't talk to me in

29:53.733 --> 29:55.500
- hashtags"?
- Well, 'cause it makes

29:55.500 --> 29:57.300
her sound like she's, like,
kidding.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.133
No, she's not
kidding.

29:59.133 --> 30:01.733
She's... she's... she's being
sarcastic, but she's pissed,

30:01.733 --> 30:04.633
- with all these question marks.
- I know, but she ruins

30:04.633 --> 30:08.367
it with the hashtags.
It's not out of character of my

30:08.367 --> 30:10.867
mom to, like, go on a rant via
text.

30:10.867 --> 30:14.333
I feel like we all do that.
But I can't really understand

30:14.333 --> 30:19.533
her tone right now, and I don't
fully understand why she's so

30:19.533 --> 30:22.233
angry and why we're speaking in
hashtags.

30:22.233 --> 30:23.900
I don't know what to say.
I just feel like I need to now

30:23.900 --> 30:25.767
- tell Kim.
- I mean, if she's kind

30:25.767 --> 30:27.567
of spiraling, like, you should
talk to her.

30:27.567 --> 30:29.400
No. I'll talk to her.
I don't have a problem with that

30:29.400 --> 30:31.267
at all.
I just want to tell Kim, you

30:31.267 --> 30:33.267
know, "Mom's really upset with
you.

30:33.267 --> 30:37.967
Like, Mom's pissed."
I don't think Kim has any idea.

30:37.967 --> 30:41.700
Ooh... trouble!

30:43.600 --> 30:45.900
How can you guarantee
that, like, they're not gonna be

30:45.900 --> 30:47.900
- hard?
- Hope it doesn't

30:47.900 --> 30:50.867
happen, but it happens.
You can never guarantee that.

30:50.867 --> 30:53.667
You are a
traitor that you would tell

30:53.667 --> 30:56.900
Caitlyn.
I don't say anything to you

30:56.900 --> 30:59.933
until I feel abandoned.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.133
Those daggers are
crazy.

31:11.133 --> 31:12.900
And they're shorter
right now.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.433
Is this the
sharpest they've ever been?

31:14.433 --> 31:16.000
If you had a baby, you
wouldn't be able to have those.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.767
- You can't wipe.
- Do you know the things

31:17.767 --> 31:19.600
I do? I give massages, I do
everything.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.600
- With this?
- Yeah.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.233
You could scramble
eggs and stuff.

31:23.233 --> 31:25.033
You're like, "Hold on..."
Let me see. Ooh.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.733
I could still massage
you.

31:26.733 --> 31:28.400
Wait. But they're spiky.
Like, they're hard.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.933
It's 'cause...
It's the first day.

31:29.933 --> 31:31.700
- Yeah.
- Wait. So, Mom is,

31:31.700 --> 31:33.733
- like, fuming with you.
- Wait. Why?

31:33.733 --> 31:36.700
She was texting me
with hashtags.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.133
She was "#disloyal.
Hashtag..."

31:39.133 --> 31:41.300
And I said, "Please don't text
me with hashtags."

31:41.300 --> 31:43.167
That's the weirdest
thing I've ever heard.

31:43.167 --> 31:44.833
She thinks you're a
traitor, and she thinks that

31:44.833 --> 31:48.700
you went against the family...
with Caitlyn.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.133
- She pissed.
- Want to call her?

31:51.133 --> 31:53.433
Yeah.

31:53.433 --> 31:56.000
I cannot believe
this.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
She's pissed.
She was, like, really upset.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.200
- What are you doing?!
- Mom, it's Khloe.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.867
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

32:02.867 --> 32:04.733
Wait. Why are you pissed
off at me?

32:04.733 --> 32:08.267
- #pissed.
- Oh, #disloyal.

32:08.267 --> 32:10.267
- Kim?
- What?

32:10.267 --> 32:14.067
You are a
traitor that you would have the

32:14.067 --> 32:19.400
nerve to go to help Caitlyn to
pick a gown.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.000
- Like, what is going on?
- She said, "Fashion

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
emergency.
I have nothing to wear."

32:24.000 --> 32:25.833
Okay, here's the
problem.

32:25.833 --> 32:29.467
Why do you need to show up to
help...?

32:29.467 --> 32:31.467
But last time I heard,
you guys are all good.

32:31.467 --> 32:33.467
That's what you don't
get.

32:33.467 --> 32:39.867
I don't say anything to you
until I feel abandoned.

32:39.867 --> 32:41.867
And that right now, I'm feeling
abandoned.

32:41.867 --> 32:43.867
Mom, I would never
abandon you.

32:43.867 --> 32:45.867
If I even knew that you really
thought...

32:45.867 --> 32:47.700
But you've abandoned
me.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.533
You have taken somebody else,
and said, "Okay, her feelings

32:49.533 --> 32:51.567
don't matter.
Everything that..."

32:51.567 --> 32:53.567
You know what?
I can't teach you...

32:53.567 --> 32:55.400
I truly didn't think
that you would care.

32:55.400 --> 33:00.067
I'm just gonna try to stay
neutral and not get involved.

33:00.067 --> 33:03.233
I don't want you to be
neutral.

33:03.233 --> 33:09.567
From my children that
I gave birth to, I want loyalty.

33:09.567 --> 33:14.033
- I don't want  neutral.
- Oh, she's really

33:14.033 --> 33:16.400
- upset.
- Neutral isn't what I

33:16.400 --> 33:22.267
signed up for.
That's what you don't get.

33:22.267 --> 33:26.667
I'm trying to be as gracious as
I can.

33:26.667 --> 33:30.867
I'm trying to be as
understanding as I can.

33:30.867 --> 33:34.400
- I'm betrayed.
- I've been  over on so

33:34.400 --> 33:39.033
many levels that your head would
spin.

33:39.033 --> 33:42.933
- Okay, Mom...
- I'm not going to

33:42.933 --> 33:46.300
play this game anymore,
okay?

33:46.300 --> 33:49.900
- Oh, my God.
- We're all shocked.

33:49.900 --> 33:54.300
Like, I had... Truly, like, I
had no idea she was this upset.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.467
I would never intentionally do
anything to hurt her like this.

33:57.467 --> 34:01.833
I would lay in front of
a bullet for any one of you.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.033
Kim totally hears you
out, and I think, moving

34:04.033 --> 34:06.033
forward, it'll be really
different.

34:06.033 --> 34:10.133
But I don't think, like, we ever
heard this extreme of it.

34:10.133 --> 34:12.133
I never would put that
out there.

34:12.133 --> 34:14.767
So I say nothing.
Because I don't want you to be

34:14.767 --> 34:17.967
conflicted.
But enough is enough.

34:17.967 --> 34:21.533
- You hurt my feelings.
- When can I work out

34:21.533 --> 34:23.533
- again?
- You should wait a

34:23.533 --> 34:25.533
month, because you don't want to
increase the risk of having scar

34:25.533 --> 34:27.600
- tissue forming in there.
- It's just the

34:27.600 --> 34:30.267
seriousness of a surgery.
I don't know.

34:30.267 --> 34:32.667
- She was like...
- Like, screaming at the

34:32.667 --> 34:34.933
top of her lungs.
I was trying to keep the peace.

34:34.933 --> 34:36.933
I-I didn't think it was a big
deal.

34:36.933 --> 34:38.933
Have you spoken to her
since?

34:38.933 --> 34:41.633
No.

34:51.700 --> 34:54.533
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, what's up?

34:54.533 --> 34:56.533
- What are you doin'?
- What, 'cause I have

34:56.533 --> 34:58.200
- sunglasses?
- No, you look

34:58.200 --> 34:59.533
- beautiful.
- Can I use this?

34:59.533 --> 35:02.767
I was with Malika at
the dentist when mom was texting

35:02.767 --> 35:05.100
- me all that crazy stuff.
- Oh, you were?

35:05.100 --> 35:07.100
We got the
aftermath.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.100
- Like, she was like...
- Like, screaming at the

35:09.100 --> 35:11.300
top of her lungs.
I was trying to keep the peace.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.600
I-I didn't think it was a big
deal.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.600
I really didn't know there was,
like... I didn't know she really

35:15.600 --> 35:17.600
- felt that way.
- Have you spoken to her

35:17.600 --> 35:19.667
- since?
- No.

35:19.667 --> 35:23.067
The ESPYs was Caitlyn's first
public appearance last year.

35:23.067 --> 35:25.600
I didn't really consider that it
might still be a really

35:25.600 --> 35:28.867
sensitive subject for my mom and
bring up these emotions and it

35:28.867 --> 35:32.133
would be this painful.
She always tries to do a really

35:32.133 --> 35:35.567
good job at not bringing drama
to us, especially if it's, like,

35:35.567 --> 35:39.333
in her personal life.
I totally feel so guilty.

35:39.333 --> 35:43.233
I feel so bad.
Like, I obviously want, like,

35:43.233 --> 35:45.733
Mom to know that she's, like, my
number one.

35:45.733 --> 35:48.700
Like, I just want to take her
out for a fun day or, like,

35:48.700 --> 35:51.033
something that she would, like,
actually think is, like, fun.

35:51.033 --> 35:58.500
Right.♪ ♪

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
- Hi.
- Good to see you

36:00.500 --> 36:02.300
- again.
- Nice to see you.

36:02.300 --> 36:03.700
- Hi.
- How are you?

36:03.700 --> 36:05.100
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you

36:05.100 --> 36:06.767
- also. Wow.
- Doesn't Kim look so

36:06.767 --> 36:09.033
business?
I look so whorish and Kim looks

36:09.033 --> 36:11.067
- so business.
- I should wear

36:11.067 --> 36:13.067
those with my black outfit.
You know, I could really get

36:13.067 --> 36:15.067
- some attention.
- You could borrow mine.

36:15.067 --> 36:17.533
Okay, let's go look at some
tits.

36:17.533 --> 36:19.200
Okay.
Are we going?

36:19.200 --> 36:20.533
- Easy as that.
- Okay.

36:20.533 --> 36:22.800
I set up a
consultation with Garth Fisher,

36:22.800 --> 36:26.867
who is a family friend.
Also, I think, like, the king of

36:26.867 --> 36:29.467
boob jobs.
He's literally done hundreds of

36:29.467 --> 36:32.100
thousands of boobs and just
knows what he's doing.

36:32.100 --> 36:35.733
- Let me grab a few implants.
- Garth, where are the

36:35.733 --> 36:38.267
good boobs?
Okay, there are the good boobs.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.233
These are...
these are the ones. Okay...

36:40.233 --> 36:42.267
Those are before and after
reconstruction cases.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.733
Like, I love the
fullness of... And, like, these

36:44.733 --> 36:46.933
- don't look super fake to me.
- Right. I think

36:46.933 --> 36:48.933
you're probably gonna be around,
you know, 350.

36:48.933 --> 36:50.933
- Something like that.
- Okay. And that's,

36:50.933 --> 36:52.933
- like, a "C"?
- Yeah. Full "C."

36:52.933 --> 36:55.400
Okay. Kimberly likes
the size of my boobs.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.400
- I just wish I had more cleavage.
- There's different

36:57.400 --> 36:59.400
styles of implants.
It just depends on what you want

36:59.400 --> 37:01.400
- to do. Yeah.
- I don't like the too,

37:01.400 --> 37:03.400
like, Playmate.
Like, I don't like really, like,

37:03.400 --> 37:05.400
- circular boobs.
- Okay.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
I like... I know you
do, like, the best, like,

37:07.400 --> 37:09.400
natural shape.
I want them to look natural.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
I don't want them... You know?
Some boobs look hard.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
Yeah, I can make
'em look...

37:13.400 --> 37:15.400
Two tennis balls-- like,
that's the worst.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.433
- Right.
- Like, how can you

37:17.433 --> 37:19.900
guarantee that, like, they're
not gonna be hard?

37:19.900 --> 37:22.700
You can never
guarantee that.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.200
What happens when you put this
in your body, your body forms

37:25.200 --> 37:27.933
scar tissue around it because
it's a foreign object.

37:27.933 --> 37:31.000
And everybody gets that in the
world, no matter where you go.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.533
Just something that's kind of a
nuisance, annoying, and somet...

37:33.533 --> 37:36.000
you know, painful sometimes.
So we hope it doesn't happen,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.033
- but...
- Okay.

37:38.033 --> 37:40.900
How long is the recovery
process?

37:40.900 --> 37:43.300
- Like, when can I work out again?
- You should wait a

37:43.300 --> 37:45.533
month.
Because you don't want to

37:45.533 --> 37:47.733
increase the risk of having scar
tissue forming in there.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.567
'Cause you're gonna have a raw
surface inside.

37:50.567 --> 37:53.433
Ugh, it's so hard.
Like, I really don't know.

37:53.433 --> 37:56.300
Do I think I would like my boobs
bigger?

37:56.300 --> 37:59.600
Yeah. It's just the seriousness
of a surgery.

37:59.600 --> 38:05.067
So I don't know.
I'm nervous.

38:05.067 --> 38:07.967
If I had known, I think
I would've had time to absorb

38:07.967 --> 38:10.467
that.
I don't even have anybody to

38:10.467 --> 38:18.033
talk to that's been through
anything similar.

38:26.567 --> 38:29.000
I love when you eat
those cookies around my house.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.733
Makes me so happy.
'Cause it just gets crumbs

38:31.733 --> 38:34.167
- everywhere.
- You ate her hand!

38:34.167 --> 38:36.967
- Wow.
- Have you thought any

38:36.967 --> 38:39.100
- more about the procedure?
- So, like, before I

38:39.100 --> 38:42.567
went went to Garth's, Kim,
it didn't seem, like, that

38:42.567 --> 38:44.500
- scary of a deal to me.
- Yeah.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.367
>> KHLOE I mean, he says
himself, he's like, "I can't

38:46.367 --> 38:48.833
guarantee you won't, like,
capsulate."

38:48.833 --> 38:53.567
No doctor can guarantee that.
He was like, "We have a 95% rate

38:53.567 --> 38:55.900
that that hasn't happened."
I know, but...

38:55.900 --> 38:58.500
But I'm not in a rush.
I still want to think about it,

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
marinate with it, and just see.
Like, I'm not in a rush to do

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
- it.
- Yeah.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.367
For me, I do want my
boobs done, in the sense that I

39:05.367 --> 39:09.333
want bigger boobs.
It's serious surgery.

39:09.333 --> 39:12.900
I'm gonna be changing a part of
my body, and I need to make sure

39:12.900 --> 39:15.333
I'm planning for healing time
and downtime and not just rush

39:15.333 --> 39:17.367
into something.
It's not that I'm never gonna

39:17.367 --> 39:20.267
get my boobs done.
I'm just... not getting them,

39:20.267 --> 39:26.100
like, today or tomorrow.
No rush. No rush.

39:33.533 --> 39:36.667
Wow.
This is so beautiful.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.967
Oh, my God, it's
beautiful.

39:38.967 --> 39:41.833
What a gorgeous,
beautiful view.

39:41.833 --> 39:44.567
The view's crazy from,
like, every direction.

39:44.567 --> 39:47.200
I do feel bad that I
hurt my mom's feelings.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.967
So Khloe and I set up this whole
fun Beverly Hills day for my

39:50.967 --> 39:53.200
- mom.
- This is definitely the

39:53.200 --> 39:55.167
suite.
Pretty

39:55.167 --> 39:57.667
and the Regent Beverly
Wilshire is the hotel that they

39:57.667 --> 39:59.833
filmed it in.
We're all gonna have lunch in

39:59.833 --> 40:02.700
the suite that was their main
suite in the movie.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.733
And I just want her to know we
support her no matter what.

40:04.733 --> 40:07.767
This is a dream.

40:07.767 --> 40:11.033
You guys, this is so fun.
Thank you so much.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.467
Ooh, yummy!
Don't you love this hotel suite?

40:13.467 --> 40:15.900
- Yes.
- We wanted you to have a

40:15.900 --> 40:20.633
fun, pampered day, as like a...
apology for upsetting you so

40:20.633 --> 40:22.967
much with, like, me dressing
Caitlyn.

40:22.967 --> 40:25.300
I mean, I would just never want

40:25.300 --> 40:27.700
you to feel betrayed, like, by
your own daughter.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.833
I obviously didn't know, you
know, how serious it was.

40:30.833 --> 40:33.700
You always act so strong and
that it just never bothers you.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.600
So...

40:41.067 --> 40:43.400
I mean, I would just
never want you to feel betrayed,

40:43.400 --> 40:46.167
like, by your own daughter.
I obviously didn't know, you

40:46.167 --> 40:49.667
know, how serious it was.
You always act so strong and

40:49.667 --> 40:52.033
that it just never bothers you.
So...

40:52.033 --> 40:54.733
I felt really bad about
getting so angry at you.

40:54.733 --> 40:56.733
- I really did.
- Why?

40:56.733 --> 40:59.133
- You should be honest.
- It took me by surprise.

40:59.133 --> 41:02.500
Even my emotion surprised me.
I don't know. I think... just if

41:02.500 --> 41:06.433
I had known, I think I would've
had time to... absorb that.

41:06.433 --> 41:10.100
Because sometimes that stuff's
hard for me.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.900
I don't even have anybody to
talk to that's been through

41:13.900 --> 41:16.167
anything similar.
You know how you guys can talk

41:16.167 --> 41:19.000
to your girlfriends?
But as a wife who was with

41:19.000 --> 41:21.433
somebody for all that time,
that's a lot of memories and a

41:21.433 --> 41:24.633
lot of years and a lot of
Christmas Eves and a lot of

41:24.633 --> 41:27.500
Father's Day and Mother's Day
and Easters and...

41:27.500 --> 41:30.000
So I don't really think about it
day to day.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.300
But for some reason, that hit
me, I guess, just the wrong way

41:34.300 --> 41:39.067
like crazy.
Going through this whole process

41:39.067 --> 41:41.933
with Caitlyn has been
challenging.

41:41.933 --> 41:45.400
I've always wanted to be there
for my kids and have kind of

41:45.400 --> 41:49.400
pushed my feelings down below
the surface so that I don't have

41:49.400 --> 41:51.767
to feel anything.
And that's always been kind of

41:51.767 --> 41:54.433
my M.O.
And I think that sometimes you

41:54.433 --> 41:57.800
have to feel what's going on
inside.

41:57.800 --> 42:02.633
And I just exploded, because I
finally was feeling what I

42:02.633 --> 42:06.233
needed to feel for so many
years.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.400
And it just all came out in one
moment.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.400
I would never go do something
like this in the middle of the

42:10.400 --> 42:12.600
day.
So this is really fun.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.467
This is so cute.
Kim wanted you to experience

42:15.467 --> 42:18.800
your favorite movie and feel
like you're Julia Roberts and

42:18.800 --> 42:21.433
- she's Richard Gere.
- I think we should go

42:21.433 --> 42:23.733
- boot shopping in honor of Julia.
- WWJD?

42:23.733 --> 42:25.733
- Yeah.
- What Would Julia Do?

42:25.733 --> 42:27.733
Yeah. What Would Julia
Do?

42:33.900 --> 42:38.133
Ooh. Hi!
How are you?

42:38.133 --> 42:41.433
- Hello.
- This store is so

42:41.433 --> 42:46.133
beautiful.
What is this?

42:46.133 --> 42:49.133
- To die. It's a jumpsuit.
- Yeah, it's pretty fab.

42:49.133 --> 42:51.167
- Wow.
- I love those little

42:51.167 --> 42:53.233
velvet shoes.
You don't love those, like...

42:53.233 --> 42:55.233
- the little velvet?
- I do. I do.

42:55.233 --> 42:58.367
Do you have an 8 1/2?
In the velvet shoes?

42:58.367 --> 43:01.633
You guys are the best.
Thank you.

43:01.633 --> 43:11.600
Mm. Thank you, Khlo.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.600
- Kris!
- You're the best mom

43:13.600 --> 43:15.600
- ever!
- Thank you!

43:15.600 --> 43:18.567
She is!
Keeping Up

43:18.567 --> 43:21.133
- with the Kardashians...
- We won!

43:21.133 --> 43:24.967
Look what I found!
We miss Scott being the Lord.

43:24.967 --> 43:27.367
I never knew you guys
wanted the Lord back so bad.

43:27.367 --> 43:30.133
You are now Duke
Disick!

43:30.133 --> 43:32.133
What's going on with my
brother?

43:32.133 --> 43:34.400
He just deleted all of the
pictures of Chyna.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.733
He hasn't spoken to
her in days.

43:35.733 --> 43:37.067
- Why?
- How dare you leave

43:37.067 --> 43:38.567
- a preg...
- I don't give a.

43:38.567 --> 43:43.667
You still need to check on her.
Rob, why did you disappear?

43:43.667 --> 43:47.567
