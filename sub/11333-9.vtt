WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210...

00:03.211 --> 00:04.129
Your mom called me.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.547
She has cancer, Silver.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.550
Navid Shirazi told me that
you were a drug dealer.
What?!

00:08.676 --> 00:09.593
Sasha, you're pregnant.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.052
I'm gonna keep the baby.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.554
'Cause you have
a huge crush on him.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.139
No, I do not have a crush
on him, okay?

00:16.809 --> 00:19.311
You're not pregnant.
Stay away from my son.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.354
Dixon, are you okay?

00:20.479 --> 00:21.438
Sasha called.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.731
She had a miscarriage.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.525
My mom died three years ago.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.234
Might want to talk
to someone who knows
what you're going through.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.195
He propositioned me.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.238
Look, I'm sorry I stormed off
like that before.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.699
You don't want to apologize
for the fact

00:31.824 --> 00:33.200
that you just
hit on my girlfriend?
What?

00:33.325 --> 00:34.201
You should go to a meeting.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.911
I just want the pain to stop.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.373
Here you go.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.248
Thank you.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.793
MAN:
Well, well.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.170
Open sesame.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.173
Dixon?

00:52.177 --> 00:55.263
Serena, we need
to reestablish Alpha Base...

00:55.389 --> 00:57.016
(singsong voice):
Dixon...

00:57.140 --> 00:58.684
...before we can proceed
with the mission.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.644
WOMAN: Captain...
Um...

01:00.769 --> 01:02.521
How you feeling?
Any better?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.107
I-I got some good news.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.359
I talked to your coach.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.110
I explained you've been
dealing with a lot

01:09.236 --> 01:10.195
these past few weeks.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.405
Threw around
some pretty serious

01:11.530 --> 01:13.448
principal rank, and guess what?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.743
You're back on the surf team.

01:15.868 --> 01:19.538
Thanks, but, uh... I'm not going
to go back on the team.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.248
Why not?

01:21.373 --> 01:24.125
Because I missed the practices,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.211
so I should suffer
the consequences.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.255
There were extenuating
circumstances.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.008
Yeah, Sasha was pregnant.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.594
And instead of supporting her,
I fought with her.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.095
Man, I've been...

01:36.221 --> 01:39.391
I've been trying to call her
and see if she's okay.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.560
She hasn't returned any
of my phone calls.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.063
Yeah, well, you know, that's...

01:44.187 --> 01:48.859
that's probably 'cause she's...
she's trying to move on.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.319
It's because she's devastated.

01:51.445 --> 01:55.074
I know it.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.242
And I'm supposed to just
go on with my life

01:57.367 --> 01:58.452
like nothing happened?

01:58.577 --> 02:01.622
Just go surfing

02:01.747 --> 02:03.290
while she's suffering, right?

02:03.415 --> 02:05.417
How is that fair?

02:09.503 --> 02:10.923
Thanks, but no thanks, Dad.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.348
WOMAN:
System is off-line

02:20.474 --> 02:22.684
and a lockdown protocol
is in effect.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.478
If we rebuild,
the lockdown will end...

02:26.605 --> 02:28.189
Honey.
Hmm?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.692
I'm really starting
to worry about Dixon.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.527
I mean, he seems miserable.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.571
Harry, he'd be more miserable
if he knew Sasha manipulated him

02:34.696 --> 02:36.323
and lied to him.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.367
He'd be heartbroken.
He'd feel like a fool.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.494
I don't know.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.870
Well, I do.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.580
I was right about Sasha,
wasn't I?

02:43.705 --> 02:44.665
Yes, you were.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.875
Okay, so trust me.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.502
It's only been a couple of days.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.796
He'll snap out of it, and then
we can all just move on

02:50.921 --> 02:51.797
and put this behind us.

02:55.342 --> 02:59.596
Rosie really wants...
blueberries.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.222
Excuse me?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.350
(chuckles)

03:03.475 --> 03:06.269
Um, Rosie really
wants blueberries.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.896
Red, red, white, blue.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.024
Of course.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.693
Can't take it on
an empty stomach, though.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.736
Here's some electrolytes.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.031
And while you
drink that,

03:17.156 --> 03:18.615
let's go over
tomorrow's schedule.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.783
All right.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.996
The nurse is going
to come at 8:30

03:24.121 --> 03:25.998
and it's Janet.
I know it's not her day,

03:26.123 --> 03:29.084
but I told Linda that she could
swap with her for next Tuesday.

03:29.208 --> 03:33.421
Anyway, uh, Janet's gonna take
you to the oncologist at 11:00,

03:33.547 --> 03:34.965
which is all written
down right here.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.925
You're scheduled
to have a CBC

03:37.051 --> 03:38.677
to check your platelets
and your fibrinogen levels.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.220
And for medications
for tomorrow,

03:40.345 --> 03:43.974
everything is written down right
here according to what you take,

03:44.099 --> 03:46.060
what time
and with or without food.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.603
So if you have any questions
just refer to the binder.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.563
Sound good?

03:49.688 --> 03:50.856
(chuckles)

03:50.981 --> 03:53.775
What?

03:53.901 --> 03:56.028
When did you get so organized?

03:56.153 --> 03:59.531
Uh, I've always been organized.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.282
You?
Yeah.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.536
Remember in fifth grade,

04:04.661 --> 04:07.414
I-I organized a class trip
to the San Diego Zoo.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.377
I passed around that petition
listing all the reasons

04:12.502 --> 04:14.295
why we deserved to go see
the giant pandas.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.843
Well, plus, I mean,
you've got to be organized

04:19.968 --> 04:21.511
to be a stage manager.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.891
I... I...

04:26.016 --> 04:29.310
I did stage manage every school
play since like seventh grade.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.897
Sure.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.611
Um, well, anyway, the point is,

04:37.736 --> 04:40.488
I'm organized,
and it's helping now.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.823
So, come on.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.367
Rosie really wants
her blueberries.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.086
♪ ♪

04:54.211 --> 04:56.213
This history homework
is killing me.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.298
I'm so over the
Battle of the Bulge.

04:58.423 --> 05:02.469
If you were dating Jamie,
you would so not be over
the battle of the bulge.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.678
You're disgusting.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.888
You're jealous.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.140
Oh, Jamie wants to know

05:06.265 --> 05:07.933
if I can to to his frat
party Saturday night.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.434
No, right?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.019
Uh, you tell me.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.063
Well, it's your half-birthday.
What time is the party?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.023
Oh, right.
Um, I'm actually not

05:15.149 --> 05:17.818
going to have a half
birthday party this year.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.157
Just, you know, everything
going on with my mom,

05:23.282 --> 05:24.616
there's just not
a lot of time.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.909
Hey.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.536
Look who's here.
Hey.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.579
Oh, thank God.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.664
I was starting to get worried.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.624
Hey, guys.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.626
Hey, you.
Hey, how you holding up?

05:34.751 --> 05:38.046
Um, I'm actually
doing a lot better.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.381
That's good.
That's so good.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.759
I'm sorry I was such a mess.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.427
Are you kidding?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.096
You had every right
to be a mess.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.265
You-You made a stupid mistake,

05:48.389 --> 05:50.517
and you lost the guy
you loved, and...

05:50.642 --> 05:51.810
I am not helping.

05:51.935 --> 05:52.811
I'm sorry.
No, that's okay.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.729
I'm okay.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.606
That's good, Ade.
And it's good
to see you.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.859
I got to go, but I'll
see you all at lunch?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.819
Yeah.
Yeah. Bye.

06:02.821 --> 06:03.864
How's she doing?

06:03.989 --> 06:05.740
Oh, I don't know.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.242
Okay... she says
she's okay,

06:07.366 --> 06:09.410
but she doesn't want to
celebrate her half-birthday.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.663
What?

06:11.788 --> 06:13.832
Well, that would probably help
her take her mind off her mom.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.625
Right?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.585
Whatever. I'm not done
working on her.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.838
No matter what, we have
to get her a gift.

06:19.963 --> 06:20.839
Oh, maybe a massage.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.757
Oh, that sounds perfect.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.720
Uh, but I'm actually running
a little low on funds.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.722
Oh, my God, don't even worry
about it.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.598
You go pick up the gift
certificate, we'll call it even.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.100
Okay.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.601
What do you think?

06:33.727 --> 06:34.686
That's so cute.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.021
It's silly.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.106
"Happy Half-Birthday."

06:38.232 --> 06:38.940
$150-- that should do it, right?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.441
Yeah.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.610
Perfect.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.945
Good to have you back, Ade.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.906
It's really good
to be back.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.664
Hey, man, I want
to talk to you.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.791
Look, I didn't hit
on Jen. Okay?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.919
And honestly, Mr. Matthews,
that woman is a psychotic bitch.

06:59.044 --> 06:59.961
Yeah, enough, okay?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.171
Well, she is.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.131
You know what, I'm
starting to think

07:03.257 --> 07:04.966
your stepdad
was right, okay?

07:05.092 --> 07:06.425
Maybe you are a bad seed.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.980
Okay, so John Campos dares me

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
to eat ten packets
of butter this morning.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.027
Don't mean to brag,
but I ate 11.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.863
The kid had five. I swear
he was gonna hurl all
over the cafeteria.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.616
That's great.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.285
Is everything okay?
Just fine.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.078
Really? 'Cause you
don't seem fine.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.871
What's wrong?
Nothing.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.790
Well, obviously
it's something.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.874
What's going on?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.042
(sighs)

07:39.167 --> 07:40.752
Liam, dude, what is it?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.087
Just back off.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.671
All right?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.340
You're not my girlfriend.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.178
Okay, another reason to have
your half-birthday soiree--

07:50.304 --> 07:51.263
I just bought a ridiculously
hot dress,

07:51.388 --> 07:53.014
and you'll get
to see me in it.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.933
Tempting, but I'll pass.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.269
Pass on what?

07:57.394 --> 07:59.938
Hmm, seeing Naomi look
ridiculously hot.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.190
Silver's half-birthday party,
which she's trying to cancel

08:02.316 --> 08:03.858
for the first time in years.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.236
(phone ringing)
Oh. Okay, I got to go.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.654
Jamie's here.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.823
Listen, just promise
you'll think about it.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.576
My dress is... picture lots of
cleavage, excellent ass.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.661
It's amazing.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.246
Hmm, we'll find another
occasion for it.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.956
Maybe bowling or something.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.333
(scoffs)

08:20.834 --> 08:22.543
Half-birthday party, huh?

08:22.669 --> 08:24.879
You so don't seem like the type

08:25.005 --> 08:28.049
of person that would
make a big deal out
of their half-birthday.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.717
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.511
It's a long walk to class.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.726
(mutters)

08:38.852 --> 08:41.229
Okay, for my
tenth birthday, um...
Mm-hmm.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.065
...all my friends
and I were gonna go
camping in my backyard.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.485
I was super excited.

08:46.609 --> 08:50.030
I mean, like, counting
the days excited.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.032
Um, and then on my birthday

08:52.157 --> 08:56.244
my mom got trashed
and I had to cancel the party.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.997
She'd missed birthdays before--

08:59.122 --> 09:01.166
she'd gotten drunk

09:01.291 --> 09:05.170
or just forgotten--
but I don't know, this one,

09:05.295 --> 09:06.796
this was the last straw, I...

09:06.921 --> 09:09.090
I just gave up on birthdays
in general.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.092
I... too many expectations.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.260
And half-birthdays?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.304
If you don't have
high expectations

09:14.429 --> 09:15.930
then you can't get let down.

09:18.392 --> 09:22.603
So what does one get a person
for their half-birthday present?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.981
A half-DVD?
Just special features?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.774
A half-bottle of champagne?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.609
I know.

Perv. No.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.865
Okay, all right. Um...

09:33.990 --> 09:35.700
How about

09:35.825 --> 09:38.119
a half-spring
break trip?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.162
It wouldn't be so bad.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.081
A one-way trip to Cabo.

GIA:
Despite the recent overdose
at Malibu Canyon High,

09:44.251 --> 09:46.920
the students are seemingly
apathetic.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.755
Teen drug use has reared
its ugly head

09:48.880 --> 09:50.465
at West Bev before.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.884
Was the case at Malibu Canyon
an isolated incident,

09:53.009 --> 09:53.968
or an indication

09:54.094 --> 09:56.054
of a larger,
yet uncovered problem

09:56.179 --> 09:57.805

10:07.607 --> 10:10.777

I'm a drug dealer?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.654
Um, look, that's-that's
what I heard.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.655
From who?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.450
A friend of mine.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.952
She said you sold
to a friend of hers.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.204
I assume you didn't talk
to this friend of a friend?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.830
Well, no, but...

10:22.956 --> 10:25.250
Right, 'cause if you did,
you would have realized

10:25.375 --> 10:27.210
that it's not true.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.463
I mean, come on, man,

10:29.588 --> 10:31.465
don't you check your sources
before you publish your stories?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.258
Yeah, of course.
Of course you do?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.385
Well, I wish you'd give me the
same respect, that's all.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.683
Look, for the record,

10:42.809 --> 10:44.269
I'm not a drug dealer.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.021
I'm just a guy who doesn't have
a lot of friends here.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.065
Never have.
I'm not a popular kid,

10:49.190 --> 10:51.359
and because of that, people like
to spread rumors about me.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.693
I-I-I...

10:52.819 --> 10:54.862
I guess I should be
used to it by now.

10:54.988 --> 10:59.117
People gossiping, you know,
but... uh...

10:59.242 --> 11:00.952

Oh, that?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.977
Well...

12:08.102 --> 12:10.271
I cut a few scenes
together from my movie

12:10.397 --> 12:12.023
and showed it
to my father.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.984
Now, granted, the guy, he
produces big-budget movies,

12:15.109 --> 12:16.194
most of which
are completely soulless.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.487

12:17.612 --> 12:19.364

12:19.489 --> 12:21.949

Oh. Oh, that...

12:24.369 --> 12:25.704

There's a small part.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.460
My dad's producing.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.003

a big movie star,

12:43.971 --> 12:45.181

Where's Liam?
Is he coming to lunch?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.322
Don't know. He was
in a nasty mood.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.074
Bit my head off earlier.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.826
Is it true you downed, like ten

11, actually.

Eleven?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.124

guys think's going on with him?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.500
Who knows?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.544
Ooh, we've got curly fries.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.003
Yeah!
Ooh. See, I'm more of

13:16.129 --> 13:17.505
a tater tot man, myself.
Mmm.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.549
Dude, you can't say "tater tot"
and "man" in the same sentence.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.134
Well, did you ask him
what was wrong?

13:21.259 --> 13:23.303
Liam? No.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.554
Well, why not?

13:24.679 --> 13:25.972
Dude, Liam's not

13:26.097 --> 13:28.349
the "talk about your
feelings" kind of guy.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.184
Yeah, okay. But what if
something's actually wrong?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
I haven't smelled
any dead bodies

13:31.603 --> 13:32.353
coming from his car, so...

13:32.479 --> 13:33.480
that is a good sign.

13:33.605 --> 13:34.439
Yeah, it is.
Good point.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.565
Guys, this isn't a joke.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.358
Okay? I mean,
he's obviously

13:37.484 --> 13:38.859
really upset
about something.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.612
And I think
it's kind of sad

13:40.737 --> 13:42.029
that the people who are
supposed to be his friends

13:42.155 --> 13:43.406
don't even really
seem to care.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.576
Excuse me.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.495
(tray slamming down)

13:48.620 --> 13:51.623
I swear, every year, I
forget about the Santa Anas

13:51.748 --> 13:53.333
and then one morning,
I'll wake up...

13:53.458 --> 13:56.002
and I'm boring you.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.920
No.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.467
(chuckles)
Okay, maybe a little.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.261
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.
I just, um...

14:05.386 --> 14:08.389
I know that you saw me with
Teddy, and I wanted to explain.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.308
I wanted to talk to
you about it earlier,

14:10.433 --> 14:13.019
but since everything that was
going on with your break-up,

14:13.144 --> 14:15.104
it... the timing wasn't right.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.482
Um...

14:17.607 --> 14:18.899
Teddy and I are...

14:19.025 --> 14:20.568
we're... we sort of, um...

14:20.694 --> 14:24.113
We're friends and I feel
so badly about that

14:24.238 --> 14:25.323
because of everything that
happened between you two,

14:25.448 --> 14:27.367
but his mom...

14:27.492 --> 14:28.576
she had cancer, too,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.745
and he's-he's been
really helpful.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.247
So I'm sorry that I
didn't tell you sooner,

14:33.373 --> 14:36.459
but uh, if you
don't want me

14:36.584 --> 14:38.336
to be friends with
him, then I won't.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.255
That's what I'll do. I-I will
stop being friends with him.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.550
(chuckles)

14:43.675 --> 14:45.301
I just want you to be happy.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.512
So, if being
friends with Teddy

14:47.637 --> 14:49.347
is going to help you
deal with your mom,

14:49.472 --> 14:51.182
go for it.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.058

Of course.

14:57.938 --> 15:01.401

15:38.229 --> 15:39.606
No. Uh, no, that's-that's okay.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.940
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.568
Hi.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.694
I don't usually do
home deliveries,

Yeah. Um, it's just, my mom has
to see this new doctor tomorrow

16:01.461 --> 16:03.671
and she needs her medical
records, which I was going to

16:03.797 --> 16:05.339
pick up after school,
but then her nurse

16:05.465 --> 16:06.800
had a family emergency.
I'll pick them up.

that Sasha doesn't want
to see you right now.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.593
Yeah, because I was being
a jerk and I made her feel

why I have to go apologize.

to tell you.

have a miscarriage.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.793

didn't add up,

and I caught her in some lies.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.857

a miscarriage to save face.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.464
Sorry, she wasn't
that hot.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.924
What'd she say?

32:06.049 --> 32:07.801
Oh, she told Matthews
that I hit on her.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.178
She told my mother
that I was stalking Naomi.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.555
All sorts of stuff.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.348
What?
Why?

32:13.473 --> 32:15.267
Forget about it.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.519
We'll wait
you out, man.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.146
And believe me,
we can wait all night.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.356
Mm-hmm.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.358
Tell us why, dude.

32:23.483 --> 32:27.320
(sighs)

32:27.446 --> 32:31.157
Last year,
at the after-prom party,

32:31.283 --> 32:34.494
she was the person that I...

32:34.620 --> 32:37.038
that I had sex with.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.374
So, wait, so, so,
it wasn't Annie?

32:39.499 --> 32:42.795
I told you it wasn't.
I know, but
I still thought...

32:42.920 --> 32:45.004
You had sex with
Naomi's sister?
No, no,
it wasn't like that.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.465
She told me she was
her neighbor.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.674
She's full of lies,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.384
this woman,
and she's been

32:49.509 --> 32:50.552
trying to destroy me
since last year.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.178
That's messed up.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.890
I'm gonna destroy Jen
before she destroys me.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.100
I just don't know how
I'm gonna do it.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.688
It's not
how you're gonna do it...

33:01.814 --> 33:03.231
it's how we're gonna do it.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.483

33:08.445 --> 33:09.738
Hell, yeah.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.657
That Amazon bitch ain't
gonna know what hit her.

33:11.782 --> 33:12.658
Get her right in the kneecaps.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.075
(chuckles)

33:14.200 --> 33:17.579
You guys, you...
you don't have to do this.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.165
We know we don't have to.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.374
But we're your friends,
remember?

33:28.799 --> 33:30.801

33:50.236 --> 33:51.530
Hey.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.782
Hey. What's wrong?

33:53.907 --> 33:57.035
I just got the call;
I didn't get the part.

33:58.244 --> 34:02.332
My dad is such an idiot.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.711
Look, I know you were
so much better than all
those other girls.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.295
Yeah, well, apparently not.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.130
You ever hear of
Johnny Weissmuller?

34:10.255 --> 34:11.632
No?

34:11.757 --> 34:13.051
Exactly.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.554
But Clark Gable, he lost
the role of Tarzan to him.

34:16.679 --> 34:17.764
Mm.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.766
You will get your part, Jane.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.351
(chuckles softly)
Yeah, maybe.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.396
No maybe.

34:24.521 --> 34:25.813
You will.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.148
You're a star.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.942
You're an old-fashioned star.

34:29.067 --> 34:33.112
You're so talented,
it's incredible.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.324
Not to mention beautiful.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.744
You're an extraordinary
person, Annie.

34:38.869 --> 34:42.496
You're so vulnerable
and yet so strong and...

34:42.621 --> 34:45.083
so innocent, but also wise.
