WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:02.120
When I was a

00:02.120 --> 00:04.040
kid, I would just,

00:04.040 --> 00:06.130
out of nowhere,
start saying things.

00:06.130 --> 00:08.630
Things like,
"Mom, in my last life

00:08.630 --> 00:10.260
I was shot down and killed."

00:13.180 --> 00:15.840
BOB GOOD:
Suzanne Ghanem identified

00:15.840 --> 00:19.600
25 different relatives
of her prior life.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.310
And their relationship.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.650
RAMY ROMANY: There was
literally no explanation

00:25.650 --> 00:30.150
of how Om Seti knew the things
she knew,

00:30.150 --> 00:34.240
of how she understood
the ancient language,

00:34.240 --> 00:39.700
how she predicted the placement
of ruins under the ground.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.620
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
You have thousands of reports

00:42.620 --> 00:44.580
of reincarnation.

00:44.580 --> 00:48.040
So one has to wonder whether
there is something behind that.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.710
WILLIAM HENRY: Did
extraterrestrials come to Earth

00:50.710 --> 00:54.130
and tweak the human body to
serve as a vehicle for the soul?

00:54.130 --> 00:55.340
And if so,

00:55.340 --> 00:57.390
what is the purpose?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.300
♪ ♪

01:26.370 --> 01:28.670
♪ ♪

01:32.380 --> 01:34.260
NARRATOR:
Lafayette, Louisiana.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.050
2001.

01:40.470 --> 01:43.270
Aside from having an unusual
obsession with airplanes

01:43.270 --> 01:45.640
and World War II,

01:45.640 --> 01:48.190
James Leininger was,
by all accounts,

01:48.190 --> 01:51.110
a normal three‐year‐old.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.230
That is, before he began having

01:53.230 --> 01:55.990
‐(gunfire)
‐a strange recurring nightmare.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.500
I would have these nightmares,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.620
and it would be just me
kicking and screaming,

02:08.620 --> 02:11.340
me with my legs
physically in the air,

02:11.340 --> 02:13.170
kicking up at the
ceiling, screaming,

02:13.170 --> 02:16.470
"Plane crash on fire,
little man can't get out."

02:16.470 --> 02:21.050
And that was every night
for almost a year.

02:21.050 --> 02:25.850
And then I would just, out of
nowhere, start saying things.

02:25.850 --> 02:29.270
Things like
"Mom, in my last life

02:29.270 --> 02:31.100
I was shot down and killed."

02:34.360 --> 02:36.150
NARRATOR:
James would draw elaborate

02:36.150 --> 02:38.650
airplane dogfight scenes.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.780
He also seemed to have an eerie
and inexplicable knowledge

02:41.780 --> 02:44.330
of World War II aircraft,

02:44.330 --> 02:47.410
right down to their components.

02:47.410 --> 02:52.080
This is a drawing I did when
I was, when I was much younger.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.630
And this is one of the ones
I signed "James 3."

02:56.630 --> 03:01.050
My dad asked me one day,
"Why do you sign it 'James 3'?"

03:01.050 --> 03:03.180
And I just turned to him
and simply said,

03:03.180 --> 03:04.930
"'Cause I'm the third James."

03:04.930 --> 03:07.890
I was the junior, junior.

03:07.890 --> 03:10.690
And then, one day,
my father asked me

03:10.690 --> 03:13.150
the name of the ship that
I was on and I said, <i>"Natoma."</i>

03:16.270 --> 03:18.440
NARRATOR:
After doing some research,

03:18.440 --> 03:22.070
James' father found that
there was, in fact,

03:22.070 --> 03:28.290
an aircraft carrier named
the USS <i>Natoma Bay</i> (CVE 62).

03:28.290 --> 03:31.080
The boy could also
indicate on a map

03:31.080 --> 03:33.170
the exact location
of where the plane

03:33.170 --> 03:35.750
he claimed to be flying
went down.

03:35.750 --> 03:40.170
‐(plane crashes)
‐In Chichijima, Japan.

03:40.170 --> 03:43.470
LEININGER: Eventually, my father
found a ship roster.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.350
And they went down the line

03:45.350 --> 03:48.140
and saw names that they
had recognized that I had said.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.720
And then they came to James.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.480
James McCready Huston.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.270
‐(weapons firing)
‐This man was killed

03:53.270 --> 03:57.520
when he was shot down
over the island Chichijima.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.950
NARRATOR:
While James Leininger's memories

04:03.950 --> 04:07.950
of his so‐called past life
remained vivid in his youth,

04:07.950 --> 04:11.040
they began to fade
as he became an adult.

04:12.910 --> 04:16.500
But what he is able to remember
still brings back

04:16.500 --> 04:18.340
powerful emotions.

04:20.170 --> 04:23.130
LEININGER:
My memories of James Huston

04:23.130 --> 04:26.850
and the things that he underwent

04:26.850 --> 04:31.390
have mostly all but gone.

04:31.390 --> 04:34.350
I can remember
this one snapshot.

04:34.350 --> 04:36.560
You...

04:36.560 --> 04:38.230
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry.

04:38.230 --> 04:43.950
And you hear, you just hear
this, this crackling.

04:43.950 --> 04:48.620
And it's just this loud banging
and this distant just...

04:48.620 --> 04:50.450
(imitates explosions)

04:52.250 --> 04:54.290
And you can see these black dots
in the sky.

04:54.290 --> 04:57.500
You look up.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.710
And eventually you see this
plane start to come down.

05:05.090 --> 05:07.760
And it hits the water.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.600
And it's black after that.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.310
You don't hear anything.
You don't see anything.

05:14.310 --> 05:17.560
It's just... it's done.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.610
NARRATOR:
Although mainstream science

05:22.610 --> 05:26.030
widely dismisses the concept
of reincarnation,

05:26.030 --> 05:29.070
leading academic institutions,

05:29.070 --> 05:30.910
such as
the University of Virginia,

05:30.910 --> 05:33.080
Duke University,

05:33.080 --> 05:35.580
and the University
of British Columbia,

05:35.580 --> 05:39.290
have entire departments
devoted to its study.

05:39.290 --> 05:40.710
And,
according to their research,

05:40.710 --> 05:44.630
a mounting body
of evidence suggests

05:44.630 --> 05:47.720
that the ability of some
to vividly recall past lives

05:47.720 --> 05:51.600
may, in fact,
be a real occurrence.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.020
TSOUKALOS:
You have thousands of reports.

05:56.020 --> 06:01.150
So one has to wonder whether
there is something behind that.

06:01.150 --> 06:06.320
There are studies that have been
made on these things,

06:06.320 --> 06:11.580
and I wonder how long it'll be
until mainstream science

06:11.580 --> 06:15.540
agrees with the idea
that something happens to us

06:15.540 --> 06:17.410
after death.

06:20.330 --> 06:24.500
The basic idea of reincarnation
is that, upon your death,

06:24.500 --> 06:28.880
your soul departs your body.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.760
You go to your version of heaven

06:32.760 --> 06:36.390
and then you come down
into a new body.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.350
An easy way to understand this

06:39.350 --> 06:42.110
is that you can upload files
from your computer

06:42.110 --> 06:43.650
to the cloud

06:43.650 --> 06:46.230
and then download files
to a new computer.

06:48.780 --> 06:51.320
NARRATOR: But while scientists
are just beginning

06:51.320 --> 06:53.870
to entertain the notion
that reincarnation

06:53.870 --> 06:55.450
may be a real occurrence,

06:55.450 --> 06:59.250
the idea of a soul
leaving one human body

06:59.250 --> 07:03.540
and entering another can be
traced back thousands of years,

07:03.540 --> 07:06.670
to the very beginning
of Egyptian civilization.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.010
Turin, Italy.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.980
On display at
the Egyptian Museum

07:18.980 --> 07:22.940
is the Turin King List,
or Royal Canon,

07:22.940 --> 07:26.940
which dates back
to the 13th century BC.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.950
The papyrus includes a list

07:31.950 --> 07:34.910
detailing the
ancient Egyptian rulers,

07:34.910 --> 07:39.700
extending back to the very start
of Egyptian civilization.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.040
We see all the timelines,
and all the kings were there,

07:43.040 --> 07:44.500
but the first two groups
of names

07:44.500 --> 07:47.880
on that list...

07:47.880 --> 07:49.710
were gods,

07:49.710 --> 07:51.840
the gods of Egypt,

07:51.840 --> 07:56.510
who they believed ruled
before the kings.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.190
NARRATOR:
Although scholars fully accept

08:02.190 --> 08:05.610
the chronology from the rule
of King Menes onward,

08:05.610 --> 08:11.400
they discount the time before
his reign around 3000 BC,

08:11.400 --> 08:15.160
a time when these alleged gods
ruled over Egypt.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.870
One of the first names
to be found on the list

08:18.870 --> 08:23.120
is the god Osiris.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.630
WILLIAM BRAMLEY: Osiris was
depicted as a human‐like god.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.250
He had human features.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.840
But one of the most curious
things about Osiris

08:30.840 --> 08:35.260
is that he was shown
with green skin.

08:35.260 --> 08:37.800
HENRY: Osiris is thought
to have come from

08:37.800 --> 08:41.060
the star system
Orion originally.

08:41.060 --> 08:44.190
And was part of a group
of extraterrestrials

08:44.190 --> 08:46.480
that came to Earth.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.690
What's interesting about
the ancient Egyptian gods

08:50.690 --> 08:52.940
is they could also die.

08:52.940 --> 08:55.070
They weren't
necessarily immortal.

08:55.070 --> 08:59.030
And when the god Osiris died,

08:59.030 --> 09:02.580
centuries ago according
to Egyptian mythology,

09:02.580 --> 09:04.870
he was reborn

09:04.870 --> 09:10.050
as his own son, Horus.

09:10.050 --> 09:15.840
And Horus became a physical
incarnation on Earth.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.100
And it is believed
by the ancient Egyptians

09:19.100 --> 09:23.640
that all the pharaohs became
gods incarnate.

09:23.640 --> 09:28.150
And once one particular
pharaoh died,

09:28.150 --> 09:33.990
the spirit would then go
into the next pharaoh.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.280
And so on, and so on.

09:36.280 --> 09:41.870
So this, this cycle
of reincarnation continued.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.080
In the ancient Egyptian
creation mythology,

09:44.080 --> 09:45.620
the god Ptah

09:45.620 --> 09:50.380
came from Sirius
and fashioned the human body.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.840
We have to ask the question:

09:51.840 --> 09:54.260
did extraterrestrials
come to Earth

09:54.260 --> 09:57.380
and tweak the human body to
serve as a vehicle for the soul?

10:02.640 --> 10:05.230
NARRATOR: If the stories
of the Egyptian gods

10:05.230 --> 10:09.060
incarnating into human bodies
are true,

10:09.060 --> 10:12.730
do all humans possess souls
that have been passed down

10:12.730 --> 10:14.860
from the beginning of mankind,

10:14.860 --> 10:16.240
and may have originated

10:16.240 --> 10:19.320
beyond Earth?

10:19.320 --> 10:22.330
Perhaps further clues
can be found

10:22.330 --> 10:26.000
by examining recent case studies
into past lives

10:26.000 --> 10:30.210
that scientists find
too remarkable to dismiss.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.970
ROMANY:
NARRATOR:
Charlottesville, Virginia, 1967.

10:41.970 --> 10:45.970
Renowned psychiatrist
Dr. Ian Stevenson

10:45.970 --> 10:49.100
launches the Division
of Personality Studies

10:49.100 --> 10:51.390
at the University of Virginia,

10:51.390 --> 10:55.110
making it one of the first
educational institutions

10:55.110 --> 11:00.150
to devote serious research
into the study of reincarnation.

11:00.150 --> 11:02.360
Over his 40‐year career,

11:02.360 --> 11:06.580
Dr. Stevenson extensively
studied more than 3,000 cases

11:06.580 --> 11:09.500
of individuals who reported
past life memories.

11:09.500 --> 11:14.290
And he was able to objectively
validate the claims being made

11:14.290 --> 11:18.340
in an astounding
1,200 instances.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.550
The body of work
by Ian Stevenson

11:20.550 --> 11:22.300
is exceptionally credible.

11:22.300 --> 11:28.390
It's painstakingly documenting
instances of things

11:28.390 --> 11:30.930
that are suggestive
of reincarnation.

11:30.930 --> 11:34.310
Now, what makes a case credible
is that the person

11:34.310 --> 11:37.610
has specific knowledge that
they couldn't possibly have.

11:37.610 --> 11:40.650
NARRATOR:
Dr. Stevenson traveled

11:40.650 --> 11:42.150
throughout the world
to meet with people

11:42.150 --> 11:44.400
claiming to have knowledge
of their past lives.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.530
You are now fully relaxed.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.740
NARRATOR:
He used various methodologies,

11:48.740 --> 11:52.160
including hypnosis,
to obtain pertinent details

11:52.160 --> 11:54.370
from his subjects,
and then would set out

11:54.370 --> 11:57.580
to authenticate
and document the evidence.

11:57.580 --> 12:02.300
One of his most striking
case studies was Suzanne Ghanem,

12:02.300 --> 12:06.930
who was born in Richmond,
Virginia in 1963.

12:06.930 --> 12:11.010
She insisted from a young age
that in her previous life

12:11.010 --> 12:14.230
she had been Hanan Monsour,
a Lebanese women

12:14.230 --> 12:18.360
who had passed away just ten
days before Suzanne was born.

12:22.150 --> 12:25.280
At the age of two,
she shared with her parents

12:25.280 --> 12:28.160
the name of Hanan's husband
and her three children,

12:28.160 --> 12:32.330
and later scribbled a phone
number on a scrap of paper.

12:32.330 --> 12:34.660
Dr. Stevenson would discover

12:34.660 --> 12:37.790
that the number matched the
Monsours' home phone number,

12:37.790 --> 12:41.340
except that the last two digits
were reversed.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.010
GOOD:
Suzanne Ghanem

12:45.010 --> 12:48.010
holds the record
for being able to identify

12:48.010 --> 12:49.890
relatives of her prior life.

12:49.890 --> 12:52.470
She walked into a room
and identified

12:52.470 --> 12:56.440
25 different relatives by name
and their relationship.

12:59.350 --> 13:00.610
NARRATOR:
In another case study,

13:00.610 --> 13:03.070
Dr. Stevenson traveled to India

13:03.070 --> 13:06.610
to research the claims
of one of the most notorious

13:06.610 --> 13:09.490
reincarnations in the region.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.910
CHILDRESS:
There's the interesting case

13:11.910 --> 13:14.370
of Shanti Devi in India.

13:14.370 --> 13:19.580
She was born in 1926,
and at the age of four

13:19.580 --> 13:22.290
she began telling her parents
that she was

13:22.290 --> 13:24.880
the reincarnation
of this other woman

13:24.880 --> 13:27.260
from another town
called Mathura.

13:27.260 --> 13:30.390
NARRATOR:
Mathura is a small village

13:30.390 --> 13:35.100
over 100 miles away from
Shanti's hometown of Delhi.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.560
By the time Shanti Devi
was nine years old,

13:38.560 --> 13:41.560
she had convinced her parents
of her prior existence,

13:41.560 --> 13:45.280
and was put in contact
with her former family.

13:45.280 --> 13:49.110
The young girl spoke directly
with the man she claimed

13:49.110 --> 13:52.160
she was married to
in her previous life.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.990
JASON MARTELL:
Shanti Devi

13:53.990 --> 13:56.200
gives very accurate information,

13:56.200 --> 13:59.460
knows exactly where she lived
in this past life,

13:59.460 --> 14:01.120
the names of people
in her family,

14:01.120 --> 14:02.880
her husband specifically.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.250
She eventually met this family
and her husband

14:06.250 --> 14:08.470
from a previous life,
and lo and behold,

14:08.470 --> 14:11.590
these people embraced her
and agreed

14:11.590 --> 14:15.100
that she is this lost relative
from another life.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.310
CHILDRESS: Eventually,
Mahatma Gandhi himself

14:18.310 --> 14:21.140
got involved
in this whole story.

14:21.140 --> 14:25.650
He had an investigation made,
and in 1936

14:25.650 --> 14:29.950
Gandhi himself said that he was
satisfied that she was

14:29.950 --> 14:33.070
the reincarnation
of this other woman.

14:36.490 --> 14:39.200
NARRATOR:
In some reincarnation cases,

14:39.200 --> 14:42.330
like that of an English woman
named Dorothy Eady,

14:42.330 --> 14:47.550
the past‐life recall went much
further back in history.

14:47.550 --> 14:51.260
As a young girl,
after a near‐death experience,

14:51.260 --> 14:55.180
she began recalling her life
as a temple virgin in Egypt

14:55.180 --> 14:59.180
during the reign of Seti I
in the 14th century BC.

15:01.390 --> 15:04.730
Eady eventually moved
to Abydos, Egypt,

15:04.730 --> 15:07.480
took on the name Om Seti,

15:07.480 --> 15:10.110
and became
a respected Egyptologist

15:10.110 --> 15:13.740
and the keeper
of the Temple of Seti.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.200
ROMANY:
It was all really interesting,

15:15.200 --> 15:18.080
because she was one of very few

15:18.080 --> 15:21.160
that perfected the ancient
Egyptian language.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.920
She could speak it.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.210
I can translate.

15:26.210 --> 15:30.300
I can try to read,
but she could speak it.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.930
And she would go to the other
Egyptologists and tell them,

15:34.930 --> 15:38.140
the gardens of whatever
is down here.

15:38.140 --> 15:40.270
Dig here, you'll find it.

15:40.270 --> 15:44.730
And most thought
she was just crazy.

15:44.730 --> 15:47.560
But they dig and they find it.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.610
She had the information.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.490
She knew things
no one else would know.

15:52.490 --> 15:56.450
There was literally
no explanation

15:56.450 --> 16:00.240
of how she knew
the things she knew,

16:00.240 --> 16:06.040
of how she understood
the language,

16:06.040 --> 16:11.760
how she predicted the placement
of ruins under the ground.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.510
I don't think anyone
up till today

16:15.510 --> 16:19.930
has an explanation of knowing
how she knew that,

16:19.930 --> 16:23.770
because she wasn't right once
and wrong three times.

16:23.770 --> 16:26.140
She was always right.

16:26.140 --> 16:28.360
Om Seti came back

16:28.360 --> 16:33.240
with a very clear memory
of her past life,

16:33.240 --> 16:37.860
specifically to find
her way back to Egypt,

16:37.860 --> 16:41.540
but also to educate us.

16:41.540 --> 16:45.660
When you'd see someone speaking
about their past life

16:45.660 --> 16:48.630
with such credibility,
such accuracy,

16:48.630 --> 16:53.510
this tells us that there is more
to it than this life.

16:53.510 --> 16:58.930
So, they are actually teaching
us about other worlds,

16:58.930 --> 17:02.470
other realities, and what we are
perhaps here to do.

17:04.810 --> 17:08.440
NARRATOR: Although Om Seti
made significant contributions

17:08.440 --> 17:11.570
to the study of ancient Egypt
and its people,

17:11.570 --> 17:14.780
it is her claim
to have been reincarnated

17:14.780 --> 17:18.240
that may be
her most important legacy.

17:18.240 --> 17:24.580
But if reincarnation
is proven to exist... why?

17:24.580 --> 17:29.210
And what does it reveal,
not only about our past lives,

17:29.210 --> 17:32.290
but also our future ones?

17:41.260 --> 17:45.890
NARRATOR: Valley of the Kings,
Luxor, Egypt.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.980
Opposite from the famous
burial chamber of King Tut

17:49.980 --> 17:53.940
is a small crypt: KV55.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.610
It is known only by a number,

17:57.610 --> 18:01.110
because even though it was
discovered over a century ago,

18:01.110 --> 18:04.370
no one is certain
who was buried there.

18:04.370 --> 18:06.450
Initially, it was thought
to belong

18:06.450 --> 18:09.580
to King Tut's father, Akhenaten,

18:09.580 --> 18:12.130
but radiological examination

18:12.130 --> 18:16.630
suggested the body
belonged to a much younger man.

18:19.930 --> 18:24.680
This is it, KV55
in the Valley of the Kings,

18:24.680 --> 18:27.220
away from the public eye.

18:27.220 --> 18:31.310
Most Egyptologists
and archaeologists

18:31.310 --> 18:35.320
are baffled and have
a lot of questions.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.690
Very little is known
about this tomb.

18:37.690 --> 18:39.280
Let's get in.

18:41.820 --> 18:45.410
One of the most common features
of all the tombs

18:45.410 --> 18:47.490
in the Valley of the Kings

18:47.490 --> 18:50.290
is the amount
of wall paintings on the tombs

18:50.290 --> 18:54.170
explaining everything
and telling the world

18:54.170 --> 18:56.840
that this is the tomb
of that king,

18:56.840 --> 18:59.010
and this is how great
that king is.

18:59.010 --> 19:00.630
But look at this tomb.

19:00.630 --> 19:04.050
Completely empty.

19:04.050 --> 19:06.640
NARRATOR:
In 1907,

19:06.640 --> 19:11.310
archaeologists allegedly found
an ominous curse on the wall,

19:11.310 --> 19:14.230
assuring that whoever occupied
this tomb

19:14.230 --> 19:17.860
would not return
in a subsequent life.

19:17.860 --> 19:19.990
When they first opened
this tomb,

19:19.990 --> 19:24.280
they found little remains
of hieroglyphics on this wall

19:24.280 --> 19:30.580
that says, "The evil one
should not live again."

19:32.870 --> 19:36.420
NARRATOR: Inside, archaeologists
found a coffin

19:36.420 --> 19:41.050
with the remains of a mummified
body with an elongated head.

19:41.050 --> 19:44.550
The right side of its skull
was smashed in.

19:44.550 --> 19:48.510
But perhaps the most striking
feature of the tomb

19:48.510 --> 19:51.930
is that, unlike all other tombs
in the valley,

19:51.930 --> 19:55.310
it was not built
to keep grave robbers out

19:55.310 --> 19:59.730
it was built specifically
to keep someone‐‐ or something‐‐

19:59.730 --> 20:02.360
trapped inside.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.910
This is the burial chamber
of the tomb.

20:05.910 --> 20:10.120
Right here is exactly where
the sarcophagus would have gone.

20:14.580 --> 20:20.630
And to north, south, east
and west of the sarcophagus,

20:20.630 --> 20:23.920
were the four
magical cardinal blocks

20:23.920 --> 20:29.010
that protects the tomb
from any intruders.

20:31.930 --> 20:35.770
This is a part
of some of the magical blocks

20:35.770 --> 20:40.570
that surrounded the sarcophagus.

20:40.570 --> 20:44.990
These rocks in every other tomb
had inscriptions on the outside,

20:44.990 --> 20:47.950
on the side facing the world,

20:47.950 --> 20:51.910
so it protects the tomb from
the world, except for this tomb.

20:51.910 --> 20:55.830
This tomb, the rocks
had hieroglyphics

20:55.830 --> 20:58.920
with the inscriptions
on the inside,

20:58.920 --> 21:02.800
as if they intentionally wanted
to protect the outside world

21:02.800 --> 21:05.380
from the contents of this tomb.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.590
NARRATOR:
The ancient Egyptians

21:09.590 --> 21:12.930
were strong believers
in reincarnation,

21:12.930 --> 21:16.270
and even had a specific name
for the part of the individual

21:16.270 --> 21:19.270
that detaches itself
from the body after death.

21:19.270 --> 21:23.230
They referred to it as Ba.

21:23.230 --> 21:26.190
The Ba is the personality.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.700
The Ba is the character.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.780
Every human had a Ba,

21:31.780 --> 21:35.830
and the Ba is the part
they believed

21:35.830 --> 21:41.330
moves out and is reincarnated
in another life,

21:41.330 --> 21:43.380
another living human.

21:45.170 --> 21:48.130
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

21:48.130 --> 21:51.550
that the concept of
what the Egyptians referred to

21:51.550 --> 21:55.720
as the Ba, or the detachment
of the spirit from the body,

21:55.720 --> 22:00.520
has been depicted in artwork
throughout history.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.690
Across the globe,

22:02.690 --> 22:07.070
over 1.5 billion people
believe in reincarnation,

22:07.070 --> 22:10.740
including nearly
all Eastern philosophies,

22:10.740 --> 22:15.200
as well as the Kabbalistic sect
of Judaism.

22:16.490 --> 22:19.750
Tibetans, we believe rebirth.

22:48.690 --> 22:52.910
In the Kabbalistic tradition
of Judaism,

22:52.910 --> 22:57.950
reincarnation is considered
a fundamental belief.

22:57.950 --> 23:00.500
And unlike other religions,

23:00.500 --> 23:02.920
which believe
you have only one lifetime

23:02.920 --> 23:05.250
in which to get it right,

23:05.250 --> 23:10.090
in the Kabbalistic tradition,
it is believed

23:10.090 --> 23:15.470
that souls are given multiple
chances to get it right.

23:15.470 --> 23:20.680
So souls are believed
to reincarnate time after time.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.110
NARRATOR: The idea
of the preexistence of the soul

23:27.110 --> 23:31.280
was once a significant doctrine
of the Christian canon,

23:31.280 --> 23:33.860
before it had been excised
from the teachings

23:33.860 --> 23:39.990
by Roman emperor
Justinian the Great in 553 AD.

23:39.990 --> 23:43.710
The early Christian belief
in reincarnation

23:43.710 --> 23:45.960
was eventually declared
a heresy.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.800
Instead of recycling to Earth
over and over again,

23:48.800 --> 23:52.130
you now only have one
destination after this life.

23:52.130 --> 23:55.090
That destination
is either Heaven or it's Hell,

23:55.090 --> 23:57.760
depending on how
you behaved in life.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.970
It was used
as a control mechanism.

24:00.970 --> 24:05.060
YOUNG: In ancient Greece,
Socrates, Pythagoras

24:05.060 --> 24:10.360
and Plato all commented on the
possibility of reincarnation.

24:10.360 --> 24:14.070
In the dialogues, Plato says,

24:14.070 --> 24:18.990
"I am confident that there truly
is such a thing as living again,

24:18.990 --> 24:21.330
and that the living spring
from the dead."

24:21.330 --> 24:25.500
So here's a strong sense
of reincarnation.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.750
CORY: There are many beliefs
around the world,

24:28.750 --> 24:31.500
that reincarnation exists.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.170
Some people believe
that certain types of souls

24:35.170 --> 24:39.100
are able to come back,
not just in one body,

24:39.100 --> 24:44.480
but in several bodies at once
to perform specific tasks.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.690
And that's one
of the reasons why

24:46.690 --> 24:48.940
there are so many more people
on the Earth today

24:48.940 --> 24:50.610
than there used to be.

24:50.610 --> 24:52.690
And also it is possible for you

24:52.690 --> 24:56.360
to reincarnate
from other planets.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.870
TSOUKALOS: Oftentimes, when
reincarnation is discussed,

24:59.870 --> 25:01.450
we only talk about it

25:01.450 --> 25:04.540
that people are reincarnated
here on Earth,

25:04.540 --> 25:06.910
and I personally always thought

25:06.910 --> 25:11.420
that that was a limiting idea
of reincarnation.

25:11.420 --> 25:16.840
I think even extraterrestrial
organisms‐‐ biological ones‐‐

25:16.840 --> 25:20.300
would be reincarnated
throughout the universe.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.390
NARRATOR:
If souls are indeed recycling

25:26.390 --> 25:30.060
through various bodies,
as so many cultures,

25:30.060 --> 25:33.320
both ancient and modern,
have proposed,

25:33.320 --> 25:37.530
is this simply the natural
continuation of life

25:37.530 --> 25:40.450
or might this process
be directed

25:40.450 --> 25:42.990
towards some greater end?

25:42.990 --> 25:46.700
One that reaches
far beyond Earth?

25:46.700 --> 25:49.830
Perhaps further clues
can be found

25:49.830 --> 25:52.920
by examining the stories
of those who claim

25:52.920 --> 25:57.300
to have been reincarnated with
a specific purpose for humanity.

26:04.970 --> 26:06.430
NARRATOR:
Dharamshala, India,

26:06.430 --> 26:10.810
May 17, 2015.

26:10.810 --> 26:12.730
CROWD (chanting):
We want justice!

26:12.730 --> 26:15.110
‐MAN: What do we want?
‐CROWD: We want freedom!

26:15.110 --> 26:16.650
MAN:
What do we want?

26:16.650 --> 26:18.440
(crowd chanting indistinctly)

26:18.440 --> 26:20.490
NARRATOR:
Tibetan exiles in India,

26:20.490 --> 26:22.700
including
the current Dalai Lama,

26:22.700 --> 26:25.490
renew their call
for Communist China

26:25.490 --> 26:27.870
to release the high‐ranking
Buddhist monk

26:27.870 --> 26:31.330
they have held captive
for the past 20 years.

26:31.330 --> 26:34.960
Gedhun Choekyi Nyima
is considered

26:34.960 --> 26:37.840
one of the world's longest‐held
political prisoners.

26:37.840 --> 26:41.510
He has been held captive
since 1995,

26:41.510 --> 26:44.890
when at the age of six,
he was recognized

26:44.890 --> 26:48.140
as the 11th reincarnation
of the Panchen Lama,

26:48.140 --> 26:51.560
the second most important
spiritual leader of Tibet

26:51.560 --> 26:55.940
after the Dalai Lama himself.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.860
NICK POPE: The Dalai Lama
unilaterally announced

26:58.860 --> 27:01.200
that they'd found
the Panchen Lama.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.780
Now, the Chinese placed him
under house arrest in China,

27:04.780 --> 27:07.450
and he's not been
heard from since.

27:07.450 --> 27:10.330
The Chinese government
installed, effectively,

27:10.330 --> 27:12.170
their own candidate.

27:12.170 --> 27:13.920
The reason for this

27:13.920 --> 27:17.130
seems to be that
the previous Panchen Lama

27:17.130 --> 27:19.340
had spoken out
against Chinese Communism,

27:19.340 --> 27:23.260
and the Chinese government
was probably worried about that.

27:23.260 --> 27:27.390
NARRATOR: Like most other
Eastern religions,

27:27.390 --> 27:29.020
the belief in reincarnation

27:29.020 --> 27:32.810
is central to the Tibetan
Buddhist philosophy.

27:32.810 --> 27:35.440
NARRATOR:
The current Dalai Lama

27:35.440 --> 27:38.650
is the 14th
in his reincarnation lineage,

27:38.650 --> 27:43.030
but he claims to be the 74th
incarnation of his spirit,

27:43.030 --> 27:47.280
which is said to trace back
to the deity Chenrezig,

27:47.280 --> 27:50.490
the founding god
of the Tibetan people.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.880
...is a very special
dedicated compassion

27:55.880 --> 27:59.380
Buddha manifested for Tibet.

28:11.060 --> 28:14.940
CORY: This being continues to
come back through reincarnations

28:14.940 --> 28:17.980
to simply help
the Tibetan people

28:17.980 --> 28:20.650
and the humans on the Earth

28:20.650 --> 28:23.860
to also find their way
to enlightenment.

28:26.860 --> 28:30.160
NARRATOR: It is said
that Chenrezig made a vow

28:30.160 --> 28:33.580
that he would not rest until he
had "liberated all the beings

28:33.580 --> 28:36.580
in all the realms of suffering."

28:36.580 --> 28:41.170
Tibetan Buddhists believe, that
in the form of the Dalai Lama,

28:41.170 --> 28:45.880
he returns to Earth in a quest
to fulfill this mission.

28:45.880 --> 28:49.510
But according to
ancient astronaut theorists,

28:49.510 --> 28:53.180
Chenrezig was not merely
an enlightened being,

28:53.180 --> 28:56.270
he was an extraterrestrial
visitor to Earth

28:56.270 --> 28:58.310
in the remote past.

28:58.310 --> 29:02.280
TSOUKALOS: In many of
the renderings similar to his,

29:02.280 --> 29:07.200
you have these Buddhas
that are in this lotus position

29:07.200 --> 29:11.200
that seem to be sitting
inside some sort of vehicles.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.740
They look like lotus flowers,

29:13.740 --> 29:19.250
and you have them surrounded
by flames and smoke.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.460
CHILDRESS:
Chenrezig is often seen floating

29:22.460 --> 29:25.760
in a kind of UFO‐shaped disc

29:25.760 --> 29:28.380
with different objects
around him.

29:28.380 --> 29:32.260
So, it would seem that really,
for Tibetan Buddhists,

29:32.260 --> 29:35.390
the Dalai Lama
is a reincarnation

29:35.390 --> 29:39.310
of some kind
of extraterrestrial god

29:39.310 --> 29:44.030
who has chosen the Tibetan
people as his people,

29:44.030 --> 29:48.530
and he continually reincarnates
over and over again,

29:48.530 --> 29:52.030
to lead these people.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.660
NARRATOR:
According to researchers,

29:57.660 --> 30:00.920
the vast majority
of reincarnated individuals

30:00.920 --> 30:05.050
are completely unaware
of their previous lives.

30:05.050 --> 30:08.220
But if the Dalai Lama
is returning

30:08.220 --> 30:10.630
to fulfill a recognized mission,

30:10.630 --> 30:13.390
could there be others
who knowingly come back

30:13.390 --> 30:16.100
with a task to complete?

30:20.770 --> 30:22.480
NARRATOR:
Hillah, Iraq.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.440
Just over 50 miles
south of Baghdad.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.990
Scattered over 2,000 acres,

30:28.990 --> 30:31.780
in the center
of the war‐torn nation,

30:31.780 --> 30:36.330
lie the ruins of one of the
ancient world's greatest cities,

30:36.330 --> 30:38.120
Babylon.

30:38.120 --> 30:43.170
During the 1980s,
Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein

30:43.170 --> 30:46.590
attempted
to reconstruct the city.

30:46.590 --> 30:50.840
He built himself
a replica structure

30:50.840 --> 30:53.340
on the ancient foundation
of the palace

30:53.340 --> 30:58.560
of the sixth century Babylonian
king, Nebuchadnezzar II,

30:58.560 --> 31:04.730
and even made plans to restore
his famous Hanging Gardens.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.150
In 1991, during
the First Gulf War,

31:08.150 --> 31:11.070
the world was introduced
to Saddam Hussein,

31:11.070 --> 31:13.200
both as a military dictator,

31:13.200 --> 31:16.240
but also, we learned
during the 1980s,

31:16.240 --> 31:18.080
Saddam had spent
over $500 million

31:18.080 --> 31:20.330
rebuilding Babylon.

31:20.330 --> 31:22.500
CHILDRESS:
One of the interesting things

31:22.500 --> 31:24.330
that came out in the news

31:24.330 --> 31:28.800
around the time
of the First Gulf War with Iraq,

31:28.800 --> 31:30.670
was that Saddam Hussein believed

31:30.670 --> 31:34.140
that he was the reincarnation
of Nebuchadnezzar II.

31:36.470 --> 31:39.850
YOUNG:
Saddam Hussein said that he was

31:39.850 --> 31:42.100
the reincarnation
of Nebuchadnezzar.

31:42.100 --> 31:45.690
He had coins made
with his image on one side,

31:45.690 --> 31:48.020
and Nebuchadnezzar on the other.

31:48.020 --> 31:51.650
The original bricks
in Babylon had the name

31:51.650 --> 31:54.740
Nebuchadnezzar engraved on them.

31:54.740 --> 31:57.870
When Saddam rebuilt
the ancient city of Babylon,

31:57.870 --> 32:01.160
he had bricks inscribed
with his own name

32:01.160 --> 32:05.330
and the name Nebuchadnezzar
engraved on them as well.

32:09.380 --> 32:12.470
NARRATOR:
Nebuchadnezzar II was a powerful

32:12.470 --> 32:16.550
and ambitious ruler, and during
his reign he made Babylon

32:16.550 --> 32:20.720
the most powerful kingdom
in the region.

32:20.720 --> 32:25.810
Much like Saddam Hussein,
Nebuchadnezzar II also set out

32:25.810 --> 32:29.230
to reconstruct the already
ancient city,

32:29.230 --> 32:31.440
specifically
focusing on restoring

32:31.440 --> 32:35.740
the Great Ziggurat of Babylon,
the Etemenanki temple.

32:38.280 --> 32:42.330
Scholars have proposed
that the site may actually be

32:42.330 --> 32:46.420
the former location
of the biblical Tower of Babel,

32:46.420 --> 32:48.960
which was constructed
after the Great Flood

32:48.960 --> 32:53.960
by orders of the ancient king,
Nimrod.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.510
TZADOK: Ancient legend tells us
that King Nebuchadnezzar

32:56.510 --> 33:00.220
was indeed himself
a reincarnation of the earlier

33:00.220 --> 33:03.020
Babylonian King Nimrod.

33:03.020 --> 33:08.270
Nimrod was the first world
dictator who created

33:08.270 --> 33:10.650
what was a world empire.

33:10.650 --> 33:14.650
Nimrod was of the descendants
of Noah.

33:14.650 --> 33:17.950
Now, Noah was very unique,
very interesting.

33:17.950 --> 33:21.160
He was born with certain
attributes which indicated

33:21.160 --> 33:23.410
that he was not of this world.

33:23.410 --> 33:25.790
NARRATOR:
If this is true,

33:25.790 --> 33:28.830
could it be that Saddam Hussein
was not only

33:28.830 --> 33:31.790
a reincarnation
of Nebuchadnezzar II,

33:31.790 --> 33:35.880
but also the biblical character
known as Nimrod?

33:37.930 --> 33:40.800
And might this being have
returned to fulfill a mission

33:40.800 --> 33:46.480
he was unable to complete
in his earlier incarnation?

33:46.480 --> 33:48.310
HENRY: What we're seeing here
is actually

33:48.310 --> 33:50.980
a progression of a soul,
or a spirit,

33:50.980 --> 33:53.980
beginning with Nimrod,
going through Nebuchadnezzar,

33:53.980 --> 33:57.570
and then reincarnating
as Saddam Hussein,

33:57.570 --> 34:00.990
who was trying to do exactly
the same thing in each lifetime.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.460
NARRATOR: If the existence of
the human soul can be proven,

34:08.460 --> 34:10.420
could it really carry remnants

34:10.420 --> 34:12.880
from previous lives?

34:12.880 --> 34:16.340
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

34:16.340 --> 34:18.630
and point to a number
of recent scientific

34:18.630 --> 34:20.880
discoveries for their proof,

34:20.880 --> 34:23.300
not only of reincarnation,

34:23.300 --> 34:26.770
but of mankind's
ancient alien origins.

34:37.690 --> 34:41.530
NARRATOR:
Stanton, Kentucky, July 2016.

34:41.530 --> 34:44.160
(siren wailing)

34:44.160 --> 34:48.200
A witness to the aftermath
of a fatal traffic collision

34:48.200 --> 34:52.120
takes a photograph of the scene
as he drives past.

34:52.120 --> 34:57.050
Upon examination of the picture,
he notices the vestige

34:57.050 --> 34:59.670
of a figure
floating above the scene.

35:01.630 --> 35:04.600
Many have suggested that this
chilling photograph

35:04.600 --> 35:08.720
actually shows the soul
leaving the body.

35:08.720 --> 35:13.650
And today an increasing number
of scientists support the notion

35:13.650 --> 35:16.150
that there may really be
a spirit that continues on

35:16.150 --> 35:18.530
after the body dies.

35:20.860 --> 35:23.860
GOOD:
The vast body of information

35:23.860 --> 35:25.530
supporting the concept

35:25.530 --> 35:27.450
or the idea of reincarnation

35:27.450 --> 35:30.870
is getting stronger
and stronger.

35:30.870 --> 35:34.380
There's nothing in the science
that precludes that,

35:34.380 --> 35:37.290
and there's some information
that actually supports it.

35:40.010 --> 35:42.130
NARRATOR:
In 1996,

35:42.130 --> 35:45.340
renowned physicist
Sir Roger Penrose

35:45.340 --> 35:48.890
and anesthesiologist
Dr. Stuart Hameroff

35:48.890 --> 35:53.020
developed a quantum theory
of consciousness that supports

35:53.020 --> 35:55.690
the notion of a separate state
of an individual

35:55.690 --> 36:00.440
that can exist beyond the
confines of a physical body.

36:00.440 --> 36:05.360
Their work highlights structures
called microtubules,

36:05.360 --> 36:09.740
which they suggest
is the seat of the soul.

36:09.740 --> 36:12.500
GOOD:
Microtubules are light pipes

36:12.500 --> 36:15.960
that allow electrons
to flow unimpeded,

36:15.960 --> 36:17.960
so the body can talk to itself.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.380
It allows consciousness to flow
throughout the body,

36:23.380 --> 36:27.220
at least so the theory goes.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.810
NARRATOR: According to their
theory, the soul itself exists

36:32.810 --> 36:36.270
in an energetic state.

36:36.270 --> 36:39.400
When the body dies,
it returns to the universe,

36:39.400 --> 36:42.740
as it cannot be destroyed.

36:42.740 --> 36:45.820
And in the case of near‐death
experiences,

36:45.820 --> 36:50.280
it may later return to the body
after resuscitation.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.870
Their theory suggests that

36:52.870 --> 36:57.460
what is happening is that some
energetic quantum essence

36:57.460 --> 37:00.750
of consciousness itself
that can exist as pure energy

37:00.750 --> 37:02.670
is exiting the body.

37:02.670 --> 37:05.170
And then, when the body
becomes viable again,

37:05.170 --> 37:07.720
it is able to reinhabit
the body through

37:07.720 --> 37:12.100
using these microtubules, much
like the idea of an antenna.

37:12.100 --> 37:15.430
We have the possibility that
this is an intelligent design.

37:15.430 --> 37:18.230
That there could be intelligent
beings before us

37:18.230 --> 37:22.110
who specifically designed
these biological bodies

37:22.110 --> 37:24.820
to be vessels for the soul.

37:29.450 --> 37:32.280
NARRATOR: According
to ancient astronaut theorists,

37:32.280 --> 37:35.750
our latest scientific
discoveries reflect the stories

37:35.750 --> 37:40.040
written by our ancestors
over 3,500 years ago,

37:40.040 --> 37:43.000
detailing how the gods
fashioned the human body

37:43.000 --> 37:45.840
to possess a soul or spirit.

37:48.010 --> 37:50.390
When you look at, uh, one
of the earliest creation myths

37:50.390 --> 37:52.680
from Mesopotamia,
they talked about how,

37:52.680 --> 37:56.350
in order for a human body
to be animated,

37:56.350 --> 37:59.440
the gods needed to connect
the soul to it,

37:59.440 --> 38:02.270
or the spiritual consciousness
to it.

38:02.270 --> 38:05.570
Otherwise it just
doesn't function.

38:05.570 --> 38:09.110
HENRY: The gods
in ancient stories have all

38:09.110 --> 38:12.030
the hallmarks of what we call
extraterrestrials.

38:12.030 --> 38:16.040
They're deeply interested in the
idea of the soul, how to move

38:16.040 --> 38:18.910
the soul from one body
to another.

38:18.910 --> 38:21.710
We call that reincarnation.

38:21.710 --> 38:23.380
So the historical record

38:23.380 --> 38:26.460
of extraterrestrials tweaking
human bodies

38:26.460 --> 38:29.340
suggests
that the ultimate purpose

38:29.340 --> 38:31.300
of this genetic alteration

38:31.300 --> 38:36.100
is to make the human body
a better vehicle for the soul.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.230
NARRATOR: Are scientists
on the verge of uncovering

38:41.230 --> 38:46.070
a profound truth‐‐ that man
really does possess a soul,

38:46.070 --> 38:49.320
and human bodies are
physiologically designed

38:49.320 --> 38:53.870
to support it,
as our ancestors claimed?

38:53.870 --> 38:58.000
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and believe

38:58.000 --> 39:01.500
the more important question...
is why?

39:09.880 --> 39:12.220
NARRATOR: New York City College
of Technology.

39:12.220 --> 39:15.720
August 2016.

39:15.720 --> 39:20.390
Physicist Gregory Matloff
publishes a paper arguing

39:20.390 --> 39:23.520
that consciousness may extend
beyond humans,

39:23.520 --> 39:26.940
and that the universe itself
might be self‐aware.

39:26.940 --> 39:30.690
Prominent scientists
like Christoph Koch

39:30.690 --> 39:35.530
and Sir Roger Penrose
also support this notion.

39:35.530 --> 39:38.910
And researchers studying
reincarnation believe

39:38.910 --> 39:43.670
it might help explain why souls
are continuously recycled.

39:43.670 --> 39:46.540
There seems to be a process
where you reincarnate

39:46.540 --> 39:49.920
repeatedly, because there is
a larger consciousness

39:49.920 --> 39:52.380
that you're a part of.

39:52.380 --> 39:55.890
In short, we upload and download
consciousness,

39:55.890 --> 40:00.560
and we're creating a common body
of information.

40:00.560 --> 40:04.060
CORY: Cosmic consciousness
is expansive.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.940
It allows us to imagine
the possibilities

40:06.940 --> 40:10.780
beyond our 3D reality.

40:10.780 --> 40:15.450
Beyond our limited way
of seeing this reality

40:15.450 --> 40:16.700
right here on the Earth.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.290
NARRATOR:
But if human bodies were created

40:21.290 --> 40:24.960
as vessels for the soul
by extraterrestrial beings,

40:24.960 --> 40:28.380
as some ancient astronaut
theorists propose,

40:28.380 --> 40:31.000
was it to feed the human
experience into

40:31.000 --> 40:33.590
a shared cosmic consciousness?

40:33.590 --> 40:37.640
And if so, could the key
to uncovering the truth

40:37.640 --> 40:42.390
about our alien origins be
walking amongst us today?

40:42.390 --> 40:44.560
Some of the souls
that are currently

40:44.560 --> 40:46.560
walking around Planet Earth

40:46.560 --> 40:49.400
have been around
for a very long time,

40:49.400 --> 40:53.990
and may be traced back
to extraterrestrials visiting

40:53.990 --> 40:56.150
in the remote past.

40:56.150 --> 40:58.660
The truth of our past
could definitely be

40:58.660 --> 41:00.910
part of our future.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.500
CHILDRESS: Extraterrestrial
reincarnated souls

41:05.500 --> 41:08.920
have been with us for thousands
and thousands of years,

41:08.920 --> 41:15.260
guiding us, leading us over
and over again as best they can

41:15.260 --> 41:18.760
to help us achieve
our various goals.

41:18.760 --> 41:21.720
HENRY:
We have to realize that

41:21.720 --> 41:24.930
extraterrestrial knowledge
is present in our world,

41:24.930 --> 41:27.890
that these souls carry
direct evidence and knowledge

41:27.890 --> 41:29.480
from our past

41:29.480 --> 41:31.980
and are perhaps being used
to fulfill

41:31.980 --> 41:34.610
the mission of these
extraterrestrial beings.

41:34.610 --> 41:38.530
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that humans are designed

41:38.530 --> 41:41.330
to carry the souls
of otherworldly beings

41:41.330 --> 41:44.950
that came to Earth
thousands of years ago?

41:44.950 --> 41:49.370
Perhaps as we learn more
about reincarnation

41:49.370 --> 41:52.790
we will be able to access
ancient knowledge

41:52.790 --> 41:55.840
seeded deep within each of us.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.800
We may also discover
that the truths

41:58.800 --> 42:01.350
about our extraterrestrial past

42:01.350 --> 42:05.180
are much closer
than we ever realized.
