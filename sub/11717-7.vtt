<i>Welcome, early risers.</i>

00:59.499 --> 01:01.150
<i>The first tour of the day</i>

01:01.217 --> 01:03.719
is always the best.

01:03.787 --> 01:05.587
But before we get started,
can anyone tell me

01:05.655 --> 01:07.306
about the battleship
we're standing on?

01:08.308 --> 01:09.625
Hey!

01:09.692 --> 01:11.560
The <i>Missouri</i> was where
the Japanese surrendered

01:11.627 --> 01:12.995
to Allied powers
to end World War II.

01:13.062 --> 01:14.796
Very good.

01:26.976 --> 01:29.644
"Mighty Mo" served in battles
all over the world.

01:29.696 --> 01:32.648
Since 1992, however, those guns,
like the <i>Missouri</i> herself,

01:32.715 --> 01:35.517
have been decommissioned,
and now she enjoys

01:35.585 --> 01:37.920
peaceful retirement
here in Pearl Harbor.

01:37.987 --> 01:40.189
Now let's get
haze gray and underway.

01:40.256 --> 01:41.840
Which is ship talk for

01:41.925 --> 01:43.459
"we're on the move."

01:45.962 --> 01:47.596
Freeze!
Don't move!

01:47.663 --> 01:48.663
Hands up!

01:48.715 --> 01:49.765
Hands in the air!

01:49.832 --> 01:51.867
Down, down, down!

01:51.935 --> 01:53.235
Down.

01:59.342 --> 02:00.609
Drop your weapon.

02:00.676 --> 02:02.677
I didn't do it!

02:02.729 --> 02:04.363
Drop your weapon now!

02:04.447 --> 02:06.865
I didn't kill my wife!

02:55.615 --> 02:58.233
Commander McGarrett,
Detective Williams.

02:58.284 --> 02:59.901
I wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

02:59.953 --> 03:02.254
Laura Hills. I recently took
over as Governor Jamison's

03:02.338 --> 03:03.505
new Public Safety Liaison.

03:03.573 --> 03:04.773
What do we got?

03:04.841 --> 03:06.575
Suspect on board
is Special Warfare Operator

03:06.626 --> 03:09.278
Second Class Graham Wilson.
SEAL Team Five.

03:09.345 --> 03:10.646
Hang on. He's a SEAL?

03:10.713 --> 03:12.080
Heavily decorated.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.248
He's holed himself up inside

03:13.299 --> 03:16.351
with an unknown
number of hostages.

03:16.419 --> 03:17.986
Any contact with him
since he's boarded yet?

03:18.054 --> 03:19.938
He told our negotiators he would
start killing the hostages

03:20.023 --> 03:21.473
if we tried to move in on him.

03:21.558 --> 03:22.608
Did he make any demands?

03:22.692 --> 03:23.625
Just one:

03:23.693 --> 03:25.310
find his wife's killer.

03:25.395 --> 03:26.762
Huh. That's interesting.

03:26.829 --> 03:27.946
When did that happen?

03:28.031 --> 03:29.097
This morning.

03:29.148 --> 03:30.699
Her name was Noreen Wilson.

03:30.767 --> 03:33.118
Graham's given us four
hours to find her killer.

03:33.202 --> 03:35.704
I guess it'd be too much to hope
that he mentioned who did it?

03:35.772 --> 03:37.806
Any suspects?
Yes. Him.

03:37.874 --> 03:39.441
HPD found Graham
at the crime scene,

03:39.492 --> 03:41.376
holding the murder weapon.

03:41.444 --> 03:43.045
When they confronted him,
he ran.

03:43.112 --> 03:44.780
And he wants us
to find the killer?

03:44.847 --> 03:47.049
I don't suppose telling him
he did it would suffice, huh?

03:47.116 --> 03:49.318
Right now my only concern
is getting those hostages

03:49.385 --> 03:51.303
off that ship.

03:51.387 --> 03:53.188
Now usually, SWAT would
handle something like this,

03:53.256 --> 03:54.590
but the governor seems to think

03:54.657 --> 03:56.291
that with your background
as a SEAL,

03:56.342 --> 03:59.895
that you'd be better equipped
to handle the situation.

03:59.962 --> 04:02.514
Him? And me-- I'm here for what,
entertainment, or what?

04:02.599 --> 04:03.982
Well, you can tell SWAT
to sit tight.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.150
I'll go in alone.

04:05.234 --> 04:06.335
Whoa.
Excuse me?

04:06.402 --> 04:07.853
That's just stupid.

04:07.937 --> 04:09.971
Graham's a SEAL. He's been
trained in close-quarter combat,

04:10.023 --> 04:11.823
which means right now
he has the high ground.

04:11.908 --> 04:13.308
You send SWAT in blind,

04:13.359 --> 04:14.843
they're going to
take heavy losses,

04:14.911 --> 04:17.144
and more than likely get
multiple hostages killed.

04:17.196 --> 04:18.579
If this guy didn't
kill his wife,

04:18.648 --> 04:20.815
he deserves at least
a conversation before

04:20.882 --> 04:23.218
we go in guns blazing.
If he did,

04:23.286 --> 04:26.088
and he's going to kill again,
I'll take him out myself.

04:26.155 --> 04:28.540
But if you want my help today,
you get it my way.

04:28.625 --> 04:29.708
I go in alone.

04:38.052 --> 04:40.104
Okay, uh,
let's say I am you,

04:40.171 --> 04:42.539
and you are the
bad guy here, okay?

04:42.607 --> 04:44.274
I would know that all the ways

04:44.342 --> 04:45.542
onto this ship
are visible somehow.

04:45.610 --> 04:48.195
So, how would you
outsmart yourself

04:48.279 --> 04:49.897
and get yourself onto that ship,

04:49.981 --> 04:54.067
without yourself seeing...
yourself?

04:54.152 --> 04:57.121
Okay, was that an actual attempt
at a question,

04:57.188 --> 04:58.956
or are you just kind of
throwing words at each other

04:59.023 --> 05:00.591
and hoping they make sense?

05:00.658 --> 05:02.793
How you gonna get on the ship
without Graham seeing you?

05:02.860 --> 05:03.911
That's all.
Graham's expecting a threat
from land,

05:03.995 --> 05:06.630
not from the water.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.265
I'm just going to go for a swim.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.716
You're going to go for a swim?

05:09.801 --> 05:12.402
You're serious? And now
you're shirtless. That's great.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.138
Believe it or not,
I've done this before.

05:14.205 --> 05:15.439
You've done this before?

05:15.507 --> 05:16.773
You've-you've snuck
onto a floating museum

05:16.841 --> 05:17.925
to rescue
a bunch of tourists

05:18.009 --> 05:19.076
who are being held captive

05:19.144 --> 05:21.111
by a man who is accused
of killing his wife?

05:21.179 --> 05:22.913
Well, I didn't mean this
literally.

05:22.981 --> 05:26.216
But look,
I can't see any other way

05:26.267 --> 05:27.651
of stopping this thing
from escalating.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.220
And we only
have four hours.

05:30.271 --> 05:32.156
All right,
what's-what's your plan?

05:32.223 --> 05:33.607
We're going to hold SWAT
in position

05:33.691 --> 05:34.925
so Graham thinks
we're still negotiating.

05:34.993 --> 05:37.327
In the meantime, I'll board,
try to make contact

05:37.395 --> 05:38.946
while you investigate
this murder.

05:39.030 --> 05:40.280
I have to gain his trust,

05:40.365 --> 05:42.199
get him to see that we're
working on his behalf.

05:42.267 --> 05:45.085
So maybe I can get these people
out safe, Graham included.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.171
But only if he feels like
I actually understand him.

05:47.238 --> 05:48.872
Okay. That's great.

05:48.923 --> 05:51.124
What happens when I investigate
this case and I find out

05:51.209 --> 05:53.544
he killed his wife-- which he
most certainly did. Then what?

05:53.595 --> 05:55.846
At least we'll know
what we're dealing with.

05:55.914 --> 05:56.847
Hey.

05:56.915 --> 05:58.682
HPD says neighbors reported

05:58.750 --> 06:00.400
hearing screams
coming from Graham's house.

06:00.468 --> 06:02.686
Cops arrived, they found him
with a knife in his hand.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.755
When they tried to arrest him,
he fled the scene.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.089
They also found
his seven-year-old daughter

06:06.140 --> 06:07.574
in the house,
hiding under a couch.

06:07.642 --> 06:09.092
She hasn't talked
since Child Welfare Services

06:09.160 --> 06:10.260
took her into custody.

06:10.311 --> 06:12.980
Maybe she saw something
that freaked her out.

06:13.064 --> 06:14.281
Okay, I'm going to go see the
kid, see if she knows anything,

06:14.365 --> 06:15.966
because, you know,
I'm the woman on the team,

06:16.034 --> 06:17.117
you'd probably ask me
to do it anyway.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.469
No, no, it's not
because you're a woman.

06:19.537 --> 06:20.954
It's because you're a rookie,
which is way worse.

06:21.039 --> 06:22.139
Now listen, I'm going
to have my phone on me

06:22.207 --> 06:24.041
but don't call me, I'll
call you, okay?.

06:24.108 --> 06:26.460
Bet you used that line before.

06:26.544 --> 06:29.112
I'll initiate contact
once I'm in a secure location.

06:29.163 --> 06:30.280
That one, too.

06:30.331 --> 06:32.382
Good luck, Aquaman!

06:59.244 --> 07:00.577
♪ ♪

07:39.233 --> 07:40.417
What the...?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:40.485 --> 07:42.019
Easy, easy, easy, okay?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.320
I'm here to help.

07:43.388 --> 07:44.621
Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett.

07:44.689 --> 07:48.725
It's about time
some backup arrived.

07:48.793 --> 07:50.877
Boatswain's Mate
First Class Ed McKay,

07:50.962 --> 07:52.529
U.S. Navy.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.998
Retired.

07:55.049 --> 07:57.134
You were running a tour.
Yeah.

07:57.201 --> 07:58.435
We heard shots fired,
and then it was chaos,

07:58.503 --> 07:59.803
people running everywhere.

07:59.871 --> 08:03.256
I was able to evac most of my
group, but a few fell behind

08:03.341 --> 08:04.908
and that lunatic
took them hostage!

08:04.976 --> 08:06.176
How many?

08:06.244 --> 08:07.277
Seven.

08:07.345 --> 08:09.146
And he took them that way,
toward the wardroom.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.084
Okay. Good work, Boats.

08:14.152 --> 08:15.585
Listen, getting you off
the ship right now

08:15.653 --> 08:16.887
is going to be
too dangerous.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.221
Is there a safe place that
you can lay low for a while?

08:18.272 --> 08:20.357
I'm not hiding anywhere.

08:20.425 --> 08:21.892
And you can put
those blueprints away,

08:21.959 --> 08:22.893
because I'm coming with you.

08:22.994 --> 08:24.394
Those are my people
that he's got.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.364
I walk this ship front
to back, five times a day.

08:27.432 --> 08:29.866
There's not a person alive
who knows it better than I do.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.335
Certainly not some map!

08:31.402 --> 08:35.238
Okay. But I say jump, you say
how high, you hear me, sailor?

08:35.289 --> 08:37.090
Yes, sir!

08:37.174 --> 08:39.676
And stay out of sight,
no matter what I do.

08:39.744 --> 08:40.443
You got it.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.355
Who's going to take care
of Lily?

08:51.422 --> 08:53.023
Graham's sister
is flying in from Oklahoma.

08:53.091 --> 08:54.925
Arrives tonight.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.194
What about on the mother's side,
is no one listed locally?

08:57.261 --> 09:00.096
Haven't found anyone yet.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.098
Has she said anything
about her mother's murder?

09:02.150 --> 09:03.934
Hasn't said a word.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.986
Thanks.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.611
Hi, Lily.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.215
My name's Kono.

09:18.282 --> 09:22.052
I bet you've been asked a lot
of questions today, huh?

09:22.119 --> 09:24.254
Well, no more questions for now,
because I'm hungry,

09:24.305 --> 09:26.306
and I'm going to go get
some shave ice

09:26.391 --> 09:29.493
if... you want to come with me.

09:38.686 --> 09:40.970
So you think this guy
killed his wife?

09:41.022 --> 09:43.240
He's gone to a lot of
trouble to say he didn't.

09:43.307 --> 09:44.508
Please.

09:44.575 --> 09:46.026
Hey. No talking here.

10:07.665 --> 10:09.332
I'm sorry, but sir?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.517
No talking!

10:10.601 --> 10:12.168
Please.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.937
I'm hypoglycemic.
My husband went to get me

10:14.005 --> 10:15.705
a snack, when...

10:15.773 --> 10:19.392
If I don't eat something soon,
I'm going to pass out.

10:21.062 --> 10:22.979
Does anyone have any food
for her?

10:24.449 --> 10:25.315
Slow!

10:26.350 --> 10:28.351
They're peanut;
it's protein.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.703
Thank you.

10:29.787 --> 10:33.056
Everyone keeps completely quiet.
Got it?

10:33.124 --> 10:35.125
Disobey that order
and I will hurt you.

10:35.193 --> 10:37.894
That's a promise.

10:45.002 --> 10:47.471
Broken furniture, blood spatter
on the walls...

10:47.538 --> 10:49.372
This was a hell of a struggle.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.807
Yeah, makes a
lot of sense.

10:50.875 --> 10:51.741
Graham's a Navy SEAL,

10:51.809 --> 10:53.109
and his wife
weighs a buck-oh-five,

10:53.177 --> 10:54.511
if that.
That's what I'm saying.

10:54.562 --> 10:56.646
This should have been an
easy kill. Why's it so sloppy?

10:56.714 --> 10:57.647
Love and hate, right?

10:57.715 --> 10:59.549
Two sides of the same coin.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.984
That's why they call
it a crime of passion.

11:01.052 --> 11:02.819
You know, marital
spat escalates,

11:02.887 --> 11:04.387
just like that,
he snaps.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.022
He goes from heads to tails.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.925
First he just wants to make
her suffer a little bit.

11:08.993 --> 11:11.161
Wife ends up dead.

11:11.229 --> 11:13.163
How long were
you married, again?

11:13.231 --> 11:15.499
It's just a theory.

11:15.566 --> 11:17.033
Hmm, Wong Lee.

11:17.084 --> 11:18.768
It's the best dim sum
on the island.

11:18.836 --> 11:19.920
You read Chinese?

11:20.004 --> 11:20.954
Yeah, enough to order.

11:21.038 --> 11:22.005
That's good to know.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.074
For the future.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.981
Wait.

11:31.048 --> 11:32.682
This is catching on something,
give me a hand.

11:32.750 --> 11:33.433
Yeah.

11:35.586 --> 11:37.454
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

11:37.522 --> 11:38.788
wait a minute.

11:48.232 --> 11:49.599
No chance you also
read Russian, right?

11:49.650 --> 11:50.967
No, why?

11:51.035 --> 11:52.702
Well, 'cause it's in Russian.

11:52.770 --> 11:53.954
How do you know?

11:54.038 --> 11:56.540
See the "V"s and backwards "R"s?

11:56.607 --> 11:58.491
I had this case back in Jersey.

11:58.576 --> 12:01.044
Russians trying to muscle in
on this crew from North Bergen.

12:01.112 --> 12:03.980
The, uh, press called
it the Borscht Bust.

12:04.048 --> 12:05.649
Got my picture in the paper.

12:05.716 --> 12:07.551
Parents must have
been very proud.

12:07.618 --> 12:08.718
They misspelled my name.

12:08.786 --> 12:10.153
Husband's file didn't
say anything

12:10.221 --> 12:11.988
about language training.

12:12.056 --> 12:13.924
Yeah, well, maybe it
belonged to the victim.

12:13.991 --> 12:15.125
Let's get it translated.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.594
What's this?

12:17.645 --> 12:18.595
"397."

12:18.646 --> 12:19.996
That's a safe
deposit box key.

12:20.064 --> 12:22.699
All right. Let's get both
of these checked out.

12:26.237 --> 12:28.338
Hey.

12:28.406 --> 12:30.206
You, uh, with Graham yet?

12:30.274 --> 12:31.658
Yeah, I got him.

12:31.742 --> 12:33.076
I got eyes on him.

12:33.144 --> 12:34.644
He's armed.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.580
He's holding seven hostages.
Behavior's pretty erratic.

12:36.647 --> 12:38.815
Oh, you mean as opposed
to most hostage-takers

12:38.866 --> 12:40.083
that are calm and composed.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.451
No, with his training,

12:41.519 --> 12:42.869
this scenario
shouldn't bother him.

12:42.954 --> 12:44.871
But he's paranoid,
he's unstable.

12:44.956 --> 12:47.223
You know what, check if he's
been treated psychiatrically.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.391
Okay.

12:48.459 --> 12:49.659
All right,
I'm in the house right now.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.661
Chin, go see if this
guy's on any meds.

12:51.712 --> 12:53.380
Hey, uh, while I've got you,

12:53.464 --> 12:54.664
uh, we found something.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.299
There's a manuscript
stashed away.

12:56.350 --> 12:57.550
It's in Russian.

12:57.635 --> 13:01.004
And, uh, a safe deposit key.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.056
So if it's local, uh,
I can subpoena the contents.

13:03.140 --> 13:04.274
Good.

13:04.342 --> 13:05.842
Sounds like you're making
progress.

13:05.893 --> 13:08.345
Yeah. You, uh, you miss me,
don't you?

13:08.412 --> 13:09.679
Oh, yeah,

13:09.747 --> 13:10.947
I-I wish you were here,
but you don't swim.

13:11.015 --> 13:12.248
I don't-I don't swim?

13:12.316 --> 13:16.119
I swim. Very well, actually.
I just choose not to.

13:16.187 --> 13:18.071
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:18.155 --> 13:19.689
You talking to your wife?

13:19.757 --> 13:21.625
I'm talking to my partner.

13:21.692 --> 13:23.793
Oh, Graham's medicine cabinet
is full-on stacked.

13:23.861 --> 13:26.463
I got sleeping pills,
lithium,

13:26.530 --> 13:28.131
and Clo-naza-pam.

13:28.199 --> 13:30.667
Clonazepam.
Wait a minute, that's a...

13:30.735 --> 13:34.604
that's an antipsychotic,
sometimes used to treat

13:34.672 --> 13:35.972
post-traumatic stress disorder.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.341
All the prescriptions
are from Dr. Klesko.

13:38.409 --> 13:40.677
Bottles are three weeks old,
but they're practically full.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.379
Okay, this is a really
stupid question,

13:42.446 --> 13:44.597
but what happens if Graham
stops taking his medicine?

13:44.682 --> 13:45.715
Shut up!

13:45.733 --> 13:47.050
You don't want to make me angry.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.985
I think we just found out.

13:49.053 --> 13:50.887
I'm also thinking
the longer this goes on,

13:50.955 --> 13:52.822
the worse it's going to get.

13:54.659 --> 13:55.742
Who's out there?

13:57.111 --> 13:58.895
McGarrett, I'm sorry.

13:58.946 --> 14:01.264
Go back to the office,
okay? Lock the door.

14:01.332 --> 14:02.732
Stay in there.

14:02.783 --> 14:04.734
What the hell are
you going to do?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.286
I'm going to cover you, go!

14:06.370 --> 14:08.838
Who's out there?  I swear...
I swear if you come in

14:08.906 --> 14:10.907
I'll kill these people!

14:16.714 --> 14:17.847
Hands up!

14:17.915 --> 14:19.683
Hey.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.384
Don't shoot, man.

14:21.452 --> 14:24.437
I got lost, I was looking
for the bathroom.

14:24.522 --> 14:25.922
I don't understand,
what's happening?

14:26.857 --> 14:29.258
Hat off.

14:31.729 --> 14:33.113
Hands behind your head.

14:33.197 --> 14:34.698
Please. Please don't shoot me.

14:34.765 --> 14:37.317
Turn around.

14:37.401 --> 14:38.702
On your knees!

14:45.910 --> 14:47.160
Get down.

14:47.244 --> 14:48.244
Keep your mouth shut!

15:14.357 --> 15:15.523
Hey. Hey, you okay?

15:15.608 --> 15:16.808
You don't look too good.

15:16.859 --> 15:18.610
Hey! No talking here.

15:18.677 --> 15:20.278
I don't think she's well,
I think she's sick, man.

15:20.346 --> 15:22.647
You look,
take a look at her.

15:22.698 --> 15:23.782
She's fine.

15:23.849 --> 15:24.899
I'm okay.

15:24.984 --> 15:27.385
Could-could we get
some water at least?

15:27.453 --> 15:30.789
What part of no talking
do you not follow?

15:30.856 --> 15:32.891
<i>Dr. Klesko,</i>
<i>we got about three hours</i>

15:32.959 --> 15:34.993
to figure this thing out.

15:35.061 --> 15:37.045
Can you tell us why
you were treating Graham?

15:37.129 --> 15:40.365
His team walked into
an ambush in Ba'Quabah, Iraq.

15:40.433 --> 15:42.901
In the crossfire
were a group of children,

15:42.969 --> 15:44.836
and none of them survived.

15:44.887 --> 15:48.306
- The trauma took a huge
- mood swings,

15:48.374 --> 15:50.141
violent outbursts.

15:50.209 --> 15:52.761
It escalated to the point the
MPs were called to his house

15:52.845 --> 15:54.179
for a domestic disturbance.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.514
And you diagnosed him with
post-traumatic stress disorder.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.283
Yes, and we were
making progress.

15:58.351 --> 16:00.685
Graham was showing
real signs of improvement.

16:00.753 --> 16:02.103
And then he had a setback.

16:02.188 --> 16:03.104
What kind of setback?

16:03.189 --> 16:05.023
He became convinced

16:05.091 --> 16:06.741
that the drugs
were clouding his judgment,

16:06.826 --> 16:09.327
so he started skipping doses,
and that only made

16:09.395 --> 16:10.728
his paranoia worse.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.365
It got to the point that he
started experiencing blackouts.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.000
Blackouts? What, you mean
he started passing out?

16:15.067 --> 16:20.338
No. PTSD patients can slip into
a disassociative fugue state.

16:20.373 --> 16:24.009
It happens when they get
agitated or perceive a threat.

16:24.076 --> 16:25.343
They can become enraged,

16:25.411 --> 16:28.179
sometimes violent.

16:28.247 --> 16:30.765
And when it's over, they have no
recollection of what happened.

16:30.850 --> 16:32.417
So it's possible Graham
killed his wife

16:32.485 --> 16:33.635
without even realizing it.

16:33.719 --> 16:35.854
I'd say it's more than possible.

16:51.771 --> 16:53.604
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

17:00.446 --> 17:02.447
Hey!

17:03.833 --> 17:05.150
Who are you?

17:05.217 --> 17:07.719
You're not a tourist.

17:07.786 --> 17:08.920
I said who are you!

17:08.954 --> 17:11.321
My name is Steve McGarrett.
I'm Five-O.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.590
But before that I was
a SEAL, just like you.

17:13.642 --> 17:15.009
BUD/S class 203.

17:15.094 --> 17:17.328
They send you in here to get me?

17:17.396 --> 17:19.931
No. I came in by myself.

17:19.982 --> 17:22.267
I don't want anyone
else involved

17:22.334 --> 17:23.768
until we get a chance
to talk straight, okay?

17:23.836 --> 17:25.103
You can tell me
what really happened.

17:25.171 --> 17:27.405
For your service,

17:27.473 --> 17:30.575
I thought you deserved
at least that much.

17:35.164 --> 17:37.699
I didn't kill my wife.

17:37.783 --> 17:39.284
Okay. I believe you, man.

17:39.351 --> 17:42.504
We're trying to get to the
bottom of that right now.

17:42.588 --> 17:44.389
Where is it?

17:45.841 --> 17:47.208
Where's the knife?
Where's the <i>knife?</i>

17:47.293 --> 17:49.227
Wait. Graham,
Graham, listen,

17:49.295 --> 17:50.361
nobody took your knife,
all right?

17:50.429 --> 17:52.180
Maybe you lost it.
But you have the gun.

17:52.264 --> 17:53.498
Graham, you have a gun,
that's right.

17:53.549 --> 17:54.632
You're in control.
Everybody here knows that.

17:54.683 --> 17:56.935
We all know who's
in control here.

17:57.002 --> 17:58.770
But you got to listen to me.

17:59.688 --> 18:01.189
If you're telling me the truth,

18:01.273 --> 18:03.108
my team is going
to find that out.

18:03.175 --> 18:04.709
They're working the
case as we speak,

18:04.777 --> 18:06.611
but you're not making
it easy on us, Graham,

18:06.679 --> 18:07.979
holding all these people here.

18:08.030 --> 18:09.581
You know? You got to do the
right thing for yourself,

18:09.648 --> 18:11.316
for your daughter.
Where's Lily?

18:11.367 --> 18:12.450
My team has her. She's safe.

18:12.518 --> 18:15.053
I promise you.
You have my word.

18:15.121 --> 18:18.556
Let's just let a couple
of folks go.

18:18.624 --> 18:22.794
Come on. You're a SEAL
and your best tactical advice

18:22.862 --> 18:25.163
is for me to let go
of my only leverage?

18:25.231 --> 18:26.915
What are you talking about?
You got me.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.500
Take me instead.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.717
I have you, too.

18:29.802 --> 18:33.054
Come on, Graham. You got
to give me something, man.

18:33.139 --> 18:34.939
You got to show me
a little good will.

18:35.007 --> 18:36.341
At least-at least let me
check on this guy

18:36.408 --> 18:38.710
before he bleeds out.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.448
Fine. Clean him up.

18:43.516 --> 18:45.517
Empty your pockets
and your purses.

18:45.568 --> 18:46.717
Don't do anything!

18:46.769 --> 18:47.652
Look at the bleeding here.
I got to stop it,

18:47.719 --> 18:48.887
I got no supplies.

18:48.954 --> 18:49.904
I need some nail glue,

18:49.989 --> 18:51.990
a sewing kit, anything.

19:00.732 --> 19:01.699
Empty them!

19:01.750 --> 19:02.917
Don't try anything.

19:03.002 --> 19:05.286
It's okay, it's okay.

19:05.371 --> 19:06.921
Let me take a look.

19:07.006 --> 19:09.757
All right, you messed him
up pretty good, Graham.

19:09.842 --> 19:13.378
Good news is,
you didn't kill him.

19:13.429 --> 19:15.180
I know.

19:15.247 --> 19:18.983
If I wanted him dead,
he'd be dead.

19:33.899 --> 19:36.201
Hey, pretty ladies.

19:36.268 --> 19:37.869
Two biggies,
on the house.

19:37.936 --> 19:39.621
Aw, thank you, Uncle.

19:39.705 --> 19:42.323
No problem.
Anything else, just holla.

19:42.408 --> 19:43.374
Okay.

19:43.442 --> 19:48.179
That's yours. Mmm.

19:48.247 --> 19:50.582
This one's mine.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.457
Is it good?

20:01.310 --> 20:03.995
My favorite's grape.

20:04.063 --> 20:06.531
You know why?

20:08.400 --> 20:11.352
Makes my, uh, tongue
purple. See?

20:17.910 --> 20:20.545
You don't like the lemon?

20:20.613 --> 20:24.315
Daddy eats that part.

20:35.177 --> 20:37.729
So, uh...

20:37.796 --> 20:40.381
this one night
at BUD/S?

20:40.499 --> 20:42.567
Me and a couple
of the guys were, uh,

20:42.635 --> 20:44.018
were sneaking
back onto base, right?

20:44.103 --> 20:47.639
And we hear this
real mean, crusty,

20:47.706 --> 20:50.241
"Hey. You ladies ready
to get wet and sandy?"

20:50.309 --> 20:52.393
Master Chief White.

20:52.478 --> 20:55.063
Yes, sir.

20:55.147 --> 20:57.949
Bet he wasn't too happy, huh?

20:58.016 --> 20:59.033
Are you kidding me?

20:59.118 --> 21:00.451
He was thrilled
to catch us.

21:00.519 --> 21:03.988
He gave us five extra hours
of cold-water conditioning.

21:04.039 --> 21:04.122
We didn't get out of
the water till dawn.

21:05.924 --> 21:08.593
That's tough love for you.

21:11.196 --> 21:13.064
So, Graham, tell me
about Noreen.

21:13.132 --> 21:15.233
Where'd you guys meet?

21:15.301 --> 21:16.701
Germany.

21:16.769 --> 21:19.304
Six and a half years ago.

21:19.371 --> 21:23.141
I was traveling
through Europe, on leave.

21:23.208 --> 21:26.711
She was working at an
all-ranks club in Ramstein.

21:26.779 --> 21:29.147
She'd just emigrated
there with her daughter.

21:30.516 --> 21:32.150
Three months later
we were married.

21:32.217 --> 21:34.268
From Russia, right?

21:35.321 --> 21:37.422
How did you know?

21:37.489 --> 21:39.624
I told you,
my people are investigating.

21:39.692 --> 21:43.761
Well, she changed her name just
before we moved to the States.

21:43.829 --> 21:46.731
She didn't like
the name Irina anyway.

21:48.834 --> 21:50.501
Just wanted to put her past
behind her, you know,

21:50.569 --> 21:53.571
start a new life.

21:54.907 --> 21:57.809
And her daughter
Lily, she was, uh,

21:57.876 --> 22:00.094
she was from
a previous marriage, right?

22:00.179 --> 22:02.547
Yeah, Lily's father died
just before she was born.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.599
Lily...

22:07.252 --> 22:10.521
I can't imagine
what she's going through.

22:13.559 --> 22:16.361
Graham,
what happened this morning?

22:18.764 --> 22:21.199
We fought.

22:21.266 --> 22:22.200
We argued.

22:22.267 --> 22:23.701
I don't even know

22:23.769 --> 22:26.237
what it was about.

22:26.288 --> 22:28.272
I-I know.

22:28.323 --> 22:30.708
I haven't been easy
to live with.

22:30.776 --> 22:32.543
Ever since I've been back,

22:32.611 --> 22:34.996
you know,
it's been difficult.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.482
Noreen says sometimes
that she's scared of me,

22:37.549 --> 22:41.219
that I'm not even the same guy
that she married to.

22:41.286 --> 22:43.054
But I was
dealing with it.

22:43.121 --> 22:44.806
I was getting better.

22:44.890 --> 22:48.059
You know, the shrink says, you
know, "When you get worked up,

22:48.126 --> 22:50.344
"just take two laps
around the block.

22:50.429 --> 22:51.529
You know, clear your head."

22:51.597 --> 22:53.147
And that's what I did.

22:53.232 --> 22:54.766
Right, so you left the house.

22:57.803 --> 23:01.939
And when I came back,
there she was

23:01.990 --> 23:03.608
in the middle
of the living room.

23:03.659 --> 23:05.943
And I tried to resuscitate her.

23:06.011 --> 23:09.697
That's when the cops,
they show up.

23:09.782 --> 23:12.033
After all Noreen and I
had been through,

23:12.117 --> 23:14.585
I figured they'd think
I'd hurt her.

23:14.653 --> 23:17.054
Got scared, I ran.

23:17.122 --> 23:20.691
I'd never hurt Noreen.

23:20.759 --> 23:22.427
And it means everything

23:22.494 --> 23:25.062
for Lily to know that I didn't
do this to her mother.

23:25.130 --> 23:26.431
I get it, Graham.

23:26.498 --> 23:27.632
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?!

23:29.134 --> 23:30.401
Back!

23:30.469 --> 23:32.804
You don't think I know
what you're doing?

23:32.855 --> 23:34.188
I'm not doing anything.

23:34.273 --> 23:35.339
Huh? We're done. Let's go.

23:35.390 --> 23:36.407
You're done playing nurse.

23:36.475 --> 23:38.376
Graham, this guy needs
a CAT scan.

23:38.444 --> 23:39.644
He needs to get off the ship.

23:39.695 --> 23:40.645
Keep me, keep all these

23:40.696 --> 23:41.879
other people, but
let this guy go.

23:41.947 --> 23:43.314
Prove to me,
Graham, prove to me

23:43.382 --> 23:45.283
that you're a good man.

23:50.456 --> 23:51.906
All right.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.324
Hey, you're free to go.

23:58.196 --> 23:59.630
Good luck.

24:02.033 --> 24:03.718
All right,
everybody else,

24:03.802 --> 24:04.836
we're moving out.

24:04.887 --> 24:06.404
Except you!

24:06.472 --> 24:08.005
You're going in there.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.640
Ah, ah!

24:09.708 --> 24:11.843
Around.

24:11.910 --> 24:15.246
I'm not interested
in playing any more

24:15.314 --> 24:17.348
of your head games.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.549
Get in.

24:21.687 --> 24:23.888
Close the door.

24:26.909 --> 24:29.059
Get back!

24:42.791 --> 24:43.958
Terrific.

24:50.814 --> 24:51.748
Where are you?

24:51.782 --> 24:52.732
The head.

24:52.816 --> 24:54.651
Graham barricaded me in here.

24:54.702 --> 24:55.702
You're in a bathroom?

24:55.786 --> 24:57.253
I could've gotten locked
into a bathroom.

24:57.321 --> 24:58.254
It's a long story.

24:58.322 --> 24:59.956
Okay, I'm calling SWAT.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.041
No, you won't call SWAT.
I'll find a way out of here.

25:02.126 --> 25:05.378
Just tell me, what do you got?

25:05.462 --> 25:06.713
Okay.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.197
Graham's psychiatrist said

25:08.265 --> 25:09.465
that he's been
experiencing blackouts,

25:09.533 --> 25:11.467
which means that he may have
killed his wife

25:11.535 --> 25:13.836
without even realizing it.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.054
No, it doesn't make sense.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.139
How does that not make sense?

25:16.206 --> 25:17.390
How does that not
make sense to you?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.826
I mean, the guy fled
the crime scene

25:19.893 --> 25:21.544
with the murder weapon
in his hand.

25:21.595 --> 25:23.663
Huh? I mean, I am no detective--

25:23.731 --> 25:25.047
Wait a minute. Where am I?

25:25.099 --> 25:26.349
Oh, I'm a detective!

25:26.417 --> 25:28.084
He is still our prime suspect!

25:28.152 --> 25:29.152
Graham identified me
as a threat,

25:29.219 --> 25:30.253
and he didn't do anything, okay?

25:30.321 --> 25:31.688
He could have killed me,
but he didn't.

25:31.739 --> 25:32.739
Okay, all right, listen.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.890
I know this guy is a SEAL,
all right?

25:34.942 --> 25:37.327
And brothers-in-arms,
the whole thing-- I get that.

25:37.394 --> 25:39.662
All right, but that does not
mean he didn't kill his wife.

25:39.730 --> 25:42.298
You're right.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.783
You're right, but I promised him

25:43.867 --> 25:45.034
that we would investigate
this murder.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.302
What do you think I'm doing?

25:46.370 --> 25:47.670
I am investigating.

25:47.738 --> 25:49.839
Unfortunately,
he is our only suspect.

25:49.907 --> 25:51.841
In my experience,
when you only have one suspect,

25:51.908 --> 25:53.676
he's usually the one
that you put in jail!

25:53.744 --> 25:56.312
Okay, you want me
to broaden the search, fine,

25:56.380 --> 25:58.081
but you're gonna have
to give me something else.

25:58.148 --> 25:59.081
As a matter of fact,

25:59.133 --> 26:00.516
I actually might
have a new lead.

26:00.584 --> 26:02.819
Graham said that Noreen
was a Russian citizen,

26:02.886 --> 26:04.253
they moved here six years ago.

26:04.321 --> 26:05.755
All right,
that'll explain why she has

26:05.806 --> 26:07.190
no record prior to '04.
Right.

26:07.257 --> 26:10.526
And she changed her identity
before they came here.

26:10.594 --> 26:11.527
Her first name is Irina.

26:11.595 --> 26:13.062
So dig deeper. You know what?

26:13.130 --> 26:15.782
Maybe that manuscript
you found can help.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.450
Okay, well,
I already sent that over

26:17.534 --> 26:18.818
to your friend Catherine
in Intelligence,

26:18.902 --> 26:20.953
and she said we'll have
a translation back in an hour.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.156
Oh, and the key-- I got a match

26:23.240 --> 26:25.508
to a safe deposit box,
First Hawaiian Bank.

26:25.576 --> 26:28.378
They're sending
the contents over right now.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.880
What was that?
What the hell was that?

26:30.947 --> 26:31.998
Danny, I'll call you back.

26:38.288 --> 26:40.590
I figured you'd want
your things back.

26:41.592 --> 26:43.226
How'd you get
past Graham

26:43.293 --> 26:44.494
without him seeing you?

26:44.561 --> 26:46.512
Well, I know things
about this ship

26:46.597 --> 26:47.997
that aren't on your map.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.365
I thought I told you
to stay put.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.467
Hmm? I'm an old man.

26:51.535 --> 26:53.403
I don't always
hear so good.

26:53.470 --> 26:54.904
Hmm?

26:56.407 --> 26:58.524
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

26:58.609 --> 26:59.859
I'm a hostage!

26:59.943 --> 27:01.310
He let me go!

27:01.362 --> 27:02.995
I need help!

27:04.915 --> 27:06.015
You get him,

27:06.083 --> 27:07.684
I keep the SEAL.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.702
And nobody else is leaving until

27:09.787 --> 27:11.504
you find out who killed Noreen.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.489
Let me speak
with McGarrett.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.926
All you need to know
is that he's still alive.

27:16.993 --> 27:18.061
And I'm watching you.

27:18.128 --> 27:20.063
You got less than two hours.

27:20.130 --> 27:21.531
And if you pull
another stunt like that,

27:21.632 --> 27:23.566
the next hostage
comes out in a body bag.

27:26.603 --> 27:30.390
You had that fellow's knife
and you were standing

27:30.474 --> 27:32.508
right next to him
and you didn't take him out?

27:32.576 --> 27:34.610
There's a way to do this
where nobody has to die.

27:34.678 --> 27:36.562
Besides, this is evidence.

27:36.647 --> 27:39.215
Look at the dried blood
on this knife.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.550
There's a fingerprint
in there.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.152
I think it was put there
at the time of the murder.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.073
Watch this.

27:57.418 --> 27:59.268
This could be what clears him.

27:59.336 --> 28:02.388
You really think he's innocent,
don't you?

28:04.425 --> 28:06.442
My team's motto is
"Leave no man behind."

28:07.344 --> 28:09.178
Now we just need
to find him.

28:09.246 --> 28:11.247
Where do you think
he took the hostages?

28:11.315 --> 28:13.516
He's gonna need another place
with a good view of the gangway.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.418
I think the best place
would be the pilothouse.

28:15.486 --> 28:18.087
Well, I know a shortcut.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.906
Lead the way.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.224
Took me a while,

28:21.291 --> 28:25.294
but I swore that I knew
the name Steve McGarrett.

28:27.614 --> 28:29.632
Your grandfather
was in the Navy, wasn't he?

28:29.700 --> 28:31.267
Yes, sir.
Stationed here at Pearl.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.835
Yeah.

28:32.903 --> 28:34.036
I remember.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.338
Wait a minute.

28:35.405 --> 28:36.906
Tough son of a gun.

28:36.957 --> 28:39.408
You served with my grandfather?

28:39.476 --> 28:40.910
On the <i>Arizona.</i>

28:40.978 --> 28:42.478
You were one of the lucky ones.

28:42.546 --> 28:43.646
It wasn't luck.

28:43.714 --> 28:45.948
I wasn't onboard that day.

28:46.016 --> 28:49.268
I lied about my age
to enlist, you know.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.687
I was 16 at the time.

28:51.755 --> 28:54.991
They found out,
but the officers liked me,

28:55.058 --> 28:58.127
and they kept me around
as a runner.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.929
So that's what

28:59.997 --> 29:04.600
I was doing December 7, 1941.

29:04.668 --> 29:07.269
Running messages

29:07.321 --> 29:11.507
to the Army at Fort Shafter
across the harbor.

29:11.575 --> 29:15.111
I could see
those explosions.

29:15.179 --> 29:18.781
Those men I admired so greatly.

29:18.849 --> 29:21.851
Oh, they gave their lives
for all of us.

29:25.122 --> 29:27.557
And I couldn't do
a damn thing for them.

29:29.593 --> 29:34.130
I walk past that <i>Arizona</i>
memorial every day, and I am

29:34.198 --> 29:38.301
reminded of their sacrifice.

29:38.368 --> 29:41.003
The man

29:41.071 --> 29:44.073
that you are named after
was a real hero.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.712
You should be very proud.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.017
I am proud.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.019
Come on.

30:01.225 --> 30:04.427
What are you drawing?

30:04.494 --> 30:06.529
Me, Mommy and Daddy.

30:19.276 --> 30:22.011
What are you drawing?

30:22.079 --> 30:26.115
This is me,
surfing this morning.

30:26.183 --> 30:28.701
Can you draw

30:28.785 --> 30:30.152
what you were doing
this morning?

30:33.690 --> 30:35.191
Okay.

30:46.870 --> 30:48.971
What is that?

30:49.039 --> 30:50.706
It's my hiding place.

30:50.757 --> 30:51.707
For when there's

30:51.758 --> 30:53.276
too much yelling.

30:53.343 --> 30:55.478
You hide under
the couch?

30:55.545 --> 30:58.381
Sometimes.

30:58.448 --> 30:59.949
Are those Daddy's shoes?

31:00.017 --> 31:01.117
No.

31:01.184 --> 31:03.586
Whose shoes are they?

31:05.622 --> 31:07.156
Hey, you don't
have to be afraid.

31:07.223 --> 31:09.325
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

31:09.393 --> 31:12.061
You can tell me.

31:16.433 --> 31:19.802
That's the man
that yelled at Mommy.

31:19.870 --> 31:22.772
Was Daddy there when
they were yelling?

31:24.625 --> 31:27.777
Okay, Lily, this is
really important.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.012
Who was that man?

31:30.080 --> 31:34.016
And what was he
saying to Mommy?

31:34.101 --> 31:37.586
I can't talk funny
like him and mommy did.

31:37.654 --> 31:39.121
But they yelled.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.356
A lot.

31:40.424 --> 31:42.959
Then Mommy got hurt.

31:46.129 --> 31:49.115
Hey, do you want to,
do you want to see where I work?

31:54.171 --> 31:55.538
Lily, who is that?

31:55.605 --> 31:56.539
Who is that man?

31:56.606 --> 31:58.174
Excuse me.

31:58.241 --> 31:59.475
Sir.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.443
Excuse me.

32:01.495 --> 32:02.795
Sir. Sir.

32:05.515 --> 32:06.949
Lily!

32:07.017 --> 32:08.951
Lily! Lily!

32:09.019 --> 32:10.019
Stop!

32:30.288 --> 32:31.872
I only took my eyes off Lily,
like, for a second.

32:31.956 --> 32:33.056
They were
targeting her.

32:33.124 --> 32:34.358
We didn't know that.

32:34.425 --> 32:35.959
There was nothing you
could've done to prevent it.

32:36.027 --> 32:38.495
So I got an APB out
on the vehicle.

32:38.546 --> 32:40.130
Uh, HPD's setting up
checkpoints.

32:40.181 --> 32:42.716
We got no plates, but Kono
got eyes on the abductors.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.184
She okay?

32:44.269 --> 32:45.536
No, I don't think so.

32:45.603 --> 32:48.705
Did you get any hits on
those fingerprints I sent you?

32:48.773 --> 32:50.274
Yeah. Um, I got a second set
on the knife,

32:50.341 --> 32:52.025
and they definitely
don't belong to Graham.

32:52.110 --> 32:53.677
And they don't belong
to Noreen, either.

32:53.728 --> 32:55.195
But, uh, they're not showing up

32:55.280 --> 32:56.780
in any HPD database,

32:56.847 --> 32:58.899
so I'm expanding the search
nationally.

32:58.983 --> 33:01.034
Great, so, uh,
we've got abductors,

33:01.119 --> 33:02.686
we've got a witness
that puts another man

33:02.737 --> 33:04.521
in the house
at the time of the murder,

33:04.572 --> 33:06.390
and we got somebody else's
prints on the blade.

33:06.457 --> 33:08.542
You know what, Danny? This is
really starting to look like...

33:08.626 --> 33:09.693
Graham didn't do it. I know.

33:09.761 --> 33:11.027
But it's not over yet.

33:11.079 --> 33:13.046
We need to find a match
on that print, Danny.

33:13.131 --> 33:14.464
You need to end
this hostage situation.

33:14.532 --> 33:17.551
And whatever you do, please,
under no circumstance

33:17.635 --> 33:19.219
tell this guy
about his daughter.

33:19.304 --> 33:21.038
He should know.

33:21.105 --> 33:22.439
No, no. He shouldn't know.
He shouldn't know.

33:22.507 --> 33:24.141
Trust me-- as a father,
the last thing you want

33:24.208 --> 33:25.842
to hear about is that something
happened to your kid.

33:25.893 --> 33:27.544
And you add that
to his irrational state of mind,

33:27.595 --> 33:29.563
things are only going
to get worse.

33:29.647 --> 33:31.181
Copy that.

33:31.232 --> 33:32.683
Don't, uh...

33:32.734 --> 33:35.185
don't get soft on this guy,
partner, all right?

33:35.236 --> 33:38.488
Not until we have absolute proof
that he didn't kill his wife.

33:38.556 --> 33:40.424
And if he did,
and it comes down to it,

33:40.491 --> 33:42.326
you going to be able
to take this guy out?

33:43.561 --> 33:45.796
It's not going to come to that.

33:50.001 --> 33:52.002
Quiet!

34:06.351 --> 34:08.351
Graham, it's McGarrett.

34:08.418 --> 34:09.803
We need to talk.

34:11.489 --> 34:14.775
I should have figured
you'd get out.

34:14.859 --> 34:16.143
Listen, I believe you.

34:16.226 --> 34:18.145
I don't think
you killed your wife.

34:18.228 --> 34:19.830
Okay?

34:19.897 --> 34:21.231
And with a little more time,
my team

34:21.282 --> 34:22.783
is going to be able
to prove that, Graham.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.650
How?

34:24.735 --> 34:26.536
Let's free those people,

34:26.603 --> 34:27.788
so we can talk.

34:27.871 --> 34:29.606
You're lying!

34:33.244 --> 34:35.161
I need my pack.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.580
This has been
going on too long.

34:36.630 --> 34:37.797
I'm going to end it now.

34:37.882 --> 34:39.516
<i>We found Noreen's passport</i>

34:39.583 --> 34:41.518
in her safe deposit box.

34:41.585 --> 34:43.520
She was born Irina Tarasova

34:43.588 --> 34:45.621
in St. Petersburg, Russia, 1979.

34:45.672 --> 34:47.491
Catherine also just sent over
the translation.

34:47.558 --> 34:48.492
The manuscript you
found at the house--

34:48.559 --> 34:49.826
it was Noreen's journal.

34:49.893 --> 34:52.396
Uh, most of it's about her life
in Russia.

34:52.463 --> 34:53.897
She was married
to, uh, a banker,

34:53.964 --> 34:55.532
and it sounded like
it was pretty brutal.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.467
Multiple accounts
of domestic violence.

34:57.535 --> 34:59.236
We got an I.D.
on him, too.

34:59.303 --> 35:01.805
Yegor Chubais.

35:01.856 --> 35:03.507
Vice president of Donvaya Bank
in Switzerland.

35:03.574 --> 35:05.075
He filed a report
saying his wife

35:05.143 --> 35:07.210
and newborn child went missing
on a trip abroad.

35:07.278 --> 35:08.545
That's him.

35:08.613 --> 35:09.646
That's who?

35:09.714 --> 35:11.081
That's the guy
that kidnapped Lily.

35:11.149 --> 35:14.051
Chubais came into Hawaii
three days ago.

35:14.118 --> 35:15.419
He's chartered a plane
to Moscow.

35:15.486 --> 35:16.586
It leaves in an hour.

35:16.654 --> 35:18.205
He's trying to
flee with Lily.

35:18.289 --> 35:19.423
That's why he comes to Hawaii.

35:19.490 --> 35:20.857
She starts a new life
to get away from him.

35:20.925 --> 35:22.059
Somehow, he finds out
where she is.

35:22.126 --> 35:23.326
And when Noreen wouldn't

35:23.394 --> 35:25.095
come with him...
Son of a bitch
kills the mother

35:25.162 --> 35:26.430
of his own daughter.

35:26.497 --> 35:29.099
Can't let them get
on that plane. Come on.

36:06.704 --> 36:08.054
Okay, come on,
everybody!

36:08.139 --> 36:10.440
Let's get moving!
Come on!

36:15.680 --> 36:18.148
Don't you move.

36:23.988 --> 36:25.605
McGarrett's not answering.

36:25.690 --> 36:27.073
Try him again.

36:32.897 --> 36:34.364
Don't answer.

36:35.666 --> 36:37.534
This could be the news
that proves your innocence.

36:37.585 --> 36:39.002
Graham, let me take the call.

36:41.088 --> 36:43.206
Put it on speaker.

36:43.257 --> 36:44.758
No tricks.

36:47.512 --> 36:49.596
Finally. There you are.
Go ahead.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.348
Danny, we're on speaker
with Graham.

36:51.415 --> 36:53.984
Tell me you got the guy
who did this.

36:54.051 --> 36:55.302
Not exactly.

36:55.386 --> 36:56.953
Uh, but we got a name
and location.

36:57.021 --> 36:58.188
We're on our way right now.

36:58.255 --> 36:59.306
Who is it?

36:59.390 --> 37:00.690
His name is
Yegor Chubais.

37:00.758 --> 37:02.826
Lily's father.

37:02.894 --> 37:04.661
That's impossible.

37:04.729 --> 37:05.996
He's dead.

37:06.063 --> 37:07.647
We I.D.'d him coming
into Honolulu Airport

37:07.732 --> 37:09.466
three days ago.

37:09.534 --> 37:11.318
Yegor's dead.

37:12.603 --> 37:15.155
Noreen told me
that he had died of cancer.

37:15.239 --> 37:17.157
Why would she lie to me?
I don't know,
Graham.

37:17.241 --> 37:18.542
I don't know.

37:18.609 --> 37:19.993
Maybe she was trying
to protect you

37:20.077 --> 37:21.478
from a past
that she's ashamed of.

37:21.546 --> 37:23.480
But if my team says
that this is the guy,

37:23.548 --> 37:25.749
this is the guy.

37:27.285 --> 37:28.852
You're lying.

37:31.355 --> 37:32.789
McGarrett.

37:32.857 --> 37:34.524
Steve.

37:34.592 --> 37:36.009
On your knees.

37:37.678 --> 37:38.929
Get on your knees.

37:42.466 --> 37:44.017
Hands behind your head.

37:54.028 --> 37:56.496
This is McGarrett. Talk.

37:56.581 --> 37:58.582
Sergeant.

38:01.869 --> 38:03.320
Deploy your men.

38:03.387 --> 38:05.372
Yes, ma'am.

38:20.938 --> 38:22.889
That's them.
All right, hold on.

38:56.841 --> 38:58.558
Hands up.

39:01.846 --> 39:03.446
Get down!
Down on the ground!

39:03.514 --> 39:05.098
Arms out.
Make a "T."

39:05.182 --> 39:06.733
Get down!

39:07.985 --> 39:09.269
On the ground,
face down.

39:09.353 --> 39:10.921
On the ground.

39:10.988 --> 39:12.522
Palms up.

39:12.573 --> 39:14.391
Cross your legs.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.242
Go ahead.

39:20.114 --> 39:21.164
You're safe now, okay?

39:28.205 --> 39:29.673
Let me take you in.

39:29.740 --> 39:33.009
Graham, we can still
work this out.

39:33.077 --> 39:34.811
We argued,

39:34.879 --> 39:36.980
and I went
for a walk.

39:37.048 --> 39:39.599
Yeah, two laps around the block.

39:39.684 --> 39:41.267
We got the guy, Graham.
You heard them.

39:41.352 --> 39:42.552
It was Yegor.

39:42.603 --> 39:44.421
What if I didn't take
that walk at all?

39:51.195 --> 39:52.128
What if I really
killed Noreen?

39:52.196 --> 39:53.129
You didn't kill her, Graham.

39:53.197 --> 39:54.965
Yegor did it.

39:55.032 --> 39:56.116
Yegor killed her. This is over.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.500
You hear me?
This is over, Graham.

39:58.703 --> 40:00.286
No! No!

40:00.371 --> 40:01.972
Get down.

40:02.039 --> 40:04.624
McGarrett, get back.

40:07.878 --> 40:09.679
Freeze. Put your
weapon down slowly

40:09.747 --> 40:12.048
and get on the ground.

40:14.218 --> 40:15.669
Now, Graham.

40:19.123 --> 40:20.223
Drop your weapon.

40:22.793 --> 40:24.344
Drop your weapon now!

40:26.797 --> 40:29.499
Cease fire. Cease fire.

40:44.915 --> 40:46.166
You okay?

40:46.250 --> 40:47.500
Getting shot hurts.

40:48.986 --> 40:51.004
What were you thinking?

40:51.088 --> 40:53.356
Well...

40:53.424 --> 40:55.859
leave no man behind.

40:56.877 --> 40:58.828
Is that right?

40:58.896 --> 41:00.880
Well, you're crazier
than I thought.

41:00.965 --> 41:03.049
Come on.

41:13.611 --> 41:15.612
Hey. Hold up.

41:16.897 --> 41:19.515
Give him a minute
with his daughter, will you?

41:19.567 --> 41:21.367
No cuffs.

41:26.357 --> 41:28.241
Go ahead.

41:38.202 --> 41:39.235
Look who that is.

41:41.705 --> 41:43.440
Daddy!

41:57.321 --> 42:00.073
Daddy, can we go home now?

42:00.157 --> 42:02.075
Not yet, baby.

42:02.159 --> 42:03.559
All right?

42:03.611 --> 42:06.329
Auntie Susan is going
to watch you for a little while.

42:06.397 --> 42:08.465
Okay?

42:08.532 --> 42:11.601
Daddy's...
he's a little bit sick.

42:11.669 --> 42:14.120
He has to get better, okay?
