00:01.827 --> 00:04.482
[Jughead] The following
isn't an imaginary story.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.136
It happened.

00:06.180 --> 00:10.140
It starts with a corpse
on a lonely country road.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.666
While in the town
of Rivervale...

00:16.494 --> 00:20.063
Archie Andrews has somehow
just come back from the dead.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.195
[Betty] Arch?

00:22.544 --> 00:23.980
Sorry I woke you, Betty.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.375
No. It's okay.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.161
I was having a nightmare.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.554
What was it about?

00:39.082 --> 00:42.042
The whole town
was sacrificing you.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.351
[thunder rumbling]

00:47.395 --> 00:49.353
[Toni] Sorry I woke you, Fangs.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.920
Oh, I was just...

00:51.660 --> 00:53.444
having this crazy-ass dream.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.664
You were...

00:57.318 --> 00:59.102
drowning.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.931
And you came back as a ghost.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.414
Was I trying
to hurt Baby Anthony?

01:08.546 --> 01:12.507
I was having
the strangest dream, Reggie.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.075
Did I get dragged
to Hell in it?

01:15.118 --> 01:17.686
Nana, what are you doing
in my room?

01:17.729 --> 01:20.819
I had the most
frightful dream, child.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.126
Same. I, um...

01:23.170 --> 01:25.781
You and I swapped bodies
for some reason.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.349
[clock ticking]

01:45.975 --> 01:47.977
[exploding]

01:48.717 --> 01:50.284
[gasps]

01:51.589 --> 01:52.808
[sighs]

01:57.160 --> 01:58.118
[thuds]

02:14.003 --> 02:16.266
Morning. How'd you sleep?

02:16.310 --> 02:19.400
Uh... I'm not sure.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.619
Oh, were you up late writing?

02:21.663 --> 02:23.621
No, I woke up
in Archie's garage.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.449
I think I was sleepwalking.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.973
Oh, it's probably just nerves.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.671
[sighs] Yeah.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.803
Wait, what am I supposed
to be nervous about?

02:31.847 --> 02:36.634
Well, it is your first day back
at school teaching, isn't it?

02:36.678 --> 02:38.941
[Tabitha] You know, it's got
to be slightly nerve-racking.

02:38.984 --> 02:42.901
But don't worry,
it will be great.
You will do great.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.339
["Don't You Forget
About Me" playing]

03:36.433 --> 03:37.695
[water running]

03:42.526 --> 03:43.875
Hey, Jughead!

03:45.399 --> 03:46.661
What's up?

03:53.668 --> 03:54.756
Ben?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.541
You're Ben Button?

03:57.585 --> 03:59.369
Of course I am.
Who else would I be?

03:59.413 --> 04:01.719
Ben, you died.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.896
You jumped out of a window
when you sacrifice yourself
to the Gargoyle King.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.942
[imperceptible]

04:08.944 --> 04:11.120
No, you're thinking
of that dude
from Stonewall Prep.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.733
Mr. Chipping? Yeah.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.387
No, no.

04:19.607 --> 04:20.912
You did it first.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.740
Maybe you hallucinated it?

04:22.784 --> 04:25.439
Yeah, maybe I'm just
hallucinating all this...

04:25.482 --> 04:30.270
FYI, daytime hallucinations
are a symptom of
paranoid schizophrenia.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.837
But listen,
have an awesome day.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.974
[Archie] Jug, hey!

04:39.017 --> 04:41.106
You okay, bro?
You look like you're
about to pass out.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.673
Just light-headed.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.154
What's going on?

04:45.197 --> 04:47.243
Not much.
Just updating everyone
on the wedding plans.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.027
Wedding?

04:49.071 --> 04:50.551
Who's getting married?

04:52.379 --> 04:54.381
[Cheryl giggles] Awkward.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.384
Jug, Betty and I are getting
married this weekend,
and you're my best man.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.124
[cell phone ringing]

04:59.168 --> 05:00.996
Impeccable timing, as always.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.913
Yes, Dr. Curdle?

05:04.956 --> 05:08.525
Miss Cooper, I have some
very distressing news.

05:08.569 --> 05:12.399
This afternoon,
I received a corpse.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.011
Jughead Jones's corpse.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.622
Is this more of your
gallows humor, Doctor?

05:18.666 --> 05:23.061
Because I'm looking
right at Jughead,
who is very much alive.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.542
That's not possible.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.762
Look, if you're still upset
about not being invited
to my wedding,

05:27.805 --> 05:29.198
get over yourself.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.069
Goodbye and please
stop harassing me.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.682
Hey, you okay?

05:34.725 --> 05:37.511
Yeah. Dr. Curdle's attempt
at humor, I guess.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.991
He claims that your body
is on his slab,

05:40.035 --> 05:43.343
which is obviously impossible
because I'm talking to you.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.869
-[door opens]
-[Dr. Curdle] Mr. Jones.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.002
It can't be.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.264
And yet it is.

05:54.658 --> 05:55.659
Well, may I?

06:07.062 --> 06:10.152
[ominous music playing]

06:11.153 --> 06:14.896
[glass breaking]

06:18.421 --> 06:21.032
It's a paradox. It must be.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.730
How did I...
How did he die?

06:22.773 --> 06:24.427
Asphyxiation.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.517
His wind pipe was crushed.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.692
He was strangled.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.433
And where was he found?

06:30.477 --> 06:32.087
The Lonely Highway.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.047
At the town limits.
By the sign.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.614
Face down.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.531
Where are his clothes,
his personal effects?

06:45.753 --> 06:49.409
Keep this body on ice
and under wraps, okay?

06:51.628 --> 06:53.282
The Lonely Highway, you said?

06:56.764 --> 06:58.766
[ominous music playing]

07:34.628 --> 07:36.934
[Jughead] It was impossible,
yet happening.

07:36.978 --> 07:40.634
Somehow, I had in my possession
a set of comic books
that seemed to be about me

07:40.677 --> 07:41.809
and my friends.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.463
[imperceptible]

07:43.506 --> 07:45.290
Where had I gotten them?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.945
I couldn't remember.

07:47.989 --> 07:51.471
And why was my doppelganger
clutching one when he died?

07:51.514 --> 07:54.561
For that matter,
how did I even have
a doppelganger?

07:54.604 --> 07:59.827
Hoping to find sane answers
for these impossible questions,
I sat down and began to read...

07:59.870 --> 08:01.350
from the beginning.

08:03.439 --> 08:04.832
[woman screaming]

08:17.279 --> 08:18.628
[box thudding]

08:18.672 --> 08:20.412
How many more boxes
of comic books do you have?

08:20.456 --> 08:21.588
This is just a fraction.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.763
[Archie] I'll be honest
with you, Jug.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.678
I didn't know you were
that into comics.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.028
Well, what can I say, Archie?
I contain multitudes.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.124
[ominous music playing]

08:42.217 --> 08:45.176
Hey, how was
your first day back?

08:45.220 --> 08:46.395
[Jughead] Tabitha.

08:48.049 --> 08:51.139
I feel like
I'm living in a movie
about parallel universes

08:51.182 --> 08:53.358
and I need your help
to figure this out.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.360
Okay.

08:55.404 --> 08:58.712
I've been having
these strange hallucinations.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.017
And these comics,

09:00.583 --> 09:01.628
they're about us.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.630
Our lives.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.676
The first 95
are called Riverdale,

09:06.720 --> 09:09.200
and they're set
in a town called Riverdale.

09:09.244 --> 09:12.856
And then there's
this explosion,
and suddenly it's Rivervale.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.903
Okay, So you think Riverdale

09:15.946 --> 09:18.688
is a parallel universe
to Rivervale?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.560
No, no.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.954
I think Rivervale
is a parallel universe
to Riverdale.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.260
It's like the comics.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.870
Riverdale comes first.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.569
And then there's Rivervale,
which is a lot like Riverdale

09:29.612 --> 09:31.701
except it's darker, nastier.

09:31.745 --> 09:36.053
It's, um, it's like a warped
reflection of Riverdale,

09:36.097 --> 09:38.752
and it just keeps
getting more twisted.

09:38.795 --> 09:42.494
So we live
in the parallel universe?

09:42.538 --> 09:43.800
Yeah.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.149
I know it's counterintuitive.

09:49.719 --> 09:50.720
Read them,

09:51.634 --> 09:52.940
then we'll talk.

09:54.115 --> 09:57.074
[Jughead narrating]
And Tabitha did.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.600
And her experience reading them
was very similar to my own.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.602
I remembered
recent events clearly,

10:02.645 --> 10:05.082
but going back further
in my memory was...

10:05.692 --> 10:06.736
hazier.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.481
Reading about events
in the Riverdale comic books
made me recall them,

10:12.524 --> 10:14.352
but as Tabitha said...

10:15.963 --> 10:17.747
That's so strange.

10:17.791 --> 10:21.838
I mean, I remember
these things happening,
but not in Riverdale.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.059
All this happened here
in Rivervale,

10:25.755 --> 10:26.626
didn't it?

10:28.584 --> 10:30.673
[Jughead narrating]
I went to Betty
and Archie next.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.633
I wanted to ask them
about one page in particular.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.636
Do you remember
that explosion, Archie?

10:37.419 --> 10:38.289
No.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.944
Not at all.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.207
That event
is the one that ended
the Riverdalecomics.

10:43.251 --> 10:45.557
The next issue
is when Rivervalestarted.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.430
I have a theory that
that explosion is what created

10:48.473 --> 10:51.476
this parallel universe
we currently find ourselves in.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.740
Wait. I kind of remember
something about this.

10:53.783 --> 10:58.222
Arch, didn't you have a dream
about an explosion
like this one

10:58.266 --> 10:59.528
or am I making that up?

10:59.571 --> 11:02.009
[imperceptible]

11:02.052 --> 11:06.666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But that was just a dream, Jug.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.148
[Jughead narrating]
I went to Veronica
and Reggie next.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.150
This is impossible.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.935
What is it?

11:14.978 --> 11:18.112
These comics depict
my father terrorizing
Riverdale for years,

11:18.155 --> 11:21.811
but my father died the night
before my quinceanera.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.727
I was so distraught.
We had to cancel
the Jonas Brothers performance.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.338
That's a massive discrepancy.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.646
Because in Riverdale,
Hiram is the main villain.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.517
He's like Darth Vader.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.520
So if Rivervale
is the dark twin-verse
then who is our Big Bad?

11:36.565 --> 11:37.827
How come I look different?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.220
What do you mean?

11:39.263 --> 11:41.701
I mean, I look like
two different people, look.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.269
Both devastatingly handsome.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.837
But other than that...

11:47.881 --> 11:50.187
That might be an anomaly.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.885
Have you shown these to Cheryl?

11:52.755 --> 11:55.018
[sighs]

11:55.062 --> 12:00.241
So, according
to this horrid pamphlet,
Kevin Keller and Moose Mason

12:00.284 --> 12:02.678
discovered the corpse
of my dead brother

12:02.722 --> 12:05.376
whilst secretly
canoodling in the woods?

12:05.420 --> 12:06.856
Yeah.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.902
How's that sync up
with your memory
of Jason's death?

12:08.945 --> 12:11.818
It doesn't,
you ghoul-lunatic.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.863
To begin with,
Jay Jay's not dead.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.213
What're you talking about?
That's impossible.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.607
I mean, your life was basically
defined by his death.

12:18.650 --> 12:23.394
I don't know what to tell you,
but I can assure you
he is still very alive.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.396
No, he's dead.
You had a funeral for him,

12:25.440 --> 12:28.095
and then you talked
to his corpse for months.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.792
-[door opens]
-[footsteps approaching]

12:37.931 --> 12:40.107
Oh, hey, Jughead.
I didn't know you were here.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.327
You ready to go
hit the court, Cher-Cher?

12:43.371 --> 12:46.243
Yeah, I just need a minute.
Wait for me at the convertible?

12:46.287 --> 12:48.115
Sure. Don't take too long.

12:52.119 --> 12:56.645
Uh... We... We had
an in-memoriam
page for him...

12:57.254 --> 12:58.473
in our yearbook.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.737
No, hobo, we didn't.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.610
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:05.654 --> 13:09.658
my beloved and very much alive
twin brother and I are off
to play doubles. Toodles.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.792
And feel free
to see yourself out.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.489
[Jughead narrating] And then,
I had one of my hunches.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.969
[school bell rings]

13:21.452 --> 13:23.367
I was right.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.109
Though Riverdale and Rivervale
diverged in ways minor
and major,

13:26.153 --> 13:27.850
they were analogous.

13:27.894 --> 13:31.158
But I needed to understand
the rules of these worlds.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.943
I needed to
sharpen my knowledge
of parallel universes.

13:33.987 --> 13:37.294
Damn, you're all
knotted up, babe.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.080
-What gives?
-Jughead.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.734
He triggered me
with all that talk
about my father.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.737
-Yeah, Donnie Darko
is the worst.
-[sighs]

13:45.781 --> 13:47.087
I got you, though.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.784
How can Reggie
make it all better?

13:51.178 --> 13:52.614
[knocking on door]

13:55.704 --> 13:57.706
Hey, babe. Miss me?

14:09.544 --> 14:14.027
I'm sorry, Mr. Jones,
but The Philosophy
of Parallel Universes

14:14.070 --> 14:17.726
was checked out years ago
and never returned.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.162
What?

14:19.206 --> 14:20.381
Who checked it out?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.515
Dilton Doiley.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.866
[sighs] Great.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.389
Can't even ask him
because he's dead.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.741
Mr. Doiley is alive.

14:32.784 --> 14:37.224
In fact, he teaches physics
just down the hall.

14:42.751 --> 14:43.621
Dilton.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.841
Hey, Jughead.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.452
I heard you were
coming back to teach.
We've missed you.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.063
[woman] Yes, we have.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.545
Ethel, what are you doing here?

14:54.589 --> 14:55.982
[Dilton] Ethel's
my teaching assistant.

14:56.852 --> 14:57.853
Oh, yeah?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.378
So, I shared
my wild theories with Dilton

15:01.422 --> 15:05.252
-who, miraculously, said...
-I believe you, Jughead.

15:05.295 --> 15:08.081
And I know a thing or two
about parallel universes.

15:08.124 --> 15:11.911
Okay. I think the explosion
at the end of issue 95
of Riverdale

15:11.954 --> 15:14.826
is what created Rivervale,
like the Big Bang.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.394
-It's as valid as any theory.
-Why do you think

15:17.438 --> 15:20.571
the events that
happened in Riverdaleare
playing out differently here?

15:20.615 --> 15:24.880
In my research,
parallel universes
are exact copies

15:24.924 --> 15:27.100
or mirror images
of one another.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.406
What you're
describing is...

15:29.450 --> 15:33.106
-something in between.
-Like a warping, right?

15:33.758 --> 15:34.629
And...

15:35.456 --> 15:37.110
I don't know, I have this...

15:38.285 --> 15:41.027
impending sense of doom,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.159
like something bad
is going to happen.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.467
-What do we do about it?
-Do?

15:47.294 --> 15:49.296
We do nothing.

15:49.339 --> 15:52.038
At any given moment,
there are an infinite number

15:52.081 --> 15:55.606
of parallel universes
in peaceful coexistence
with one another.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.782
Just forget it, Jughead.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.785
-Live your life.
-Dude, I'm not
just gonna drop it.

16:00.829 --> 16:04.267
I became aware for a reason,
conscious of the two universes.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.096
Why? What about
the other Jughead?

16:07.140 --> 16:08.445
Isn't that a paradox?

16:08.489 --> 16:11.013
It sounds more like
an anomaly than a paradox.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.623
Dilton, he was
murdered by someone.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.887
Then, have Sheriff Keller
investigate, if you want.

16:15.931 --> 16:19.761
My advice, stop trying
to figure out the secrets
to the universe.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.938
You have
a good life here, Jughead.

16:24.853 --> 16:25.723
Go with the flow.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.686
So, you're saying he's me?

16:32.556 --> 16:35.255
No, bro, you're me.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.953
-There is no you, all right?
-[Veronica] There is, though.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.868
I mean, based on
Jughead's earlier visit,

16:39.911 --> 16:44.612
there are
two parallel universes,
and, apparently, two Reggies.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.006
But I came first.
I'm Reggie Prime, baby.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.791
Yeah, but you've been
in, like, three issues.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.011
-I've been in dozens.
-[Veronica] Guys...

16:52.054 --> 16:56.841
It doesn't matter
who came first or who
has been in more issues.

16:56.885 --> 17:00.019
You're both here now
and whatever else,

17:00.062 --> 17:01.672
we obviously
can't have the two of you

17:01.716 --> 17:04.675
running around town
freaking everybody
the hell out.

17:04.719 --> 17:09.854
So, you're both staying here
incommunicado
until further notice.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.204
I have to get
the casino ready

17:11.247 --> 17:13.162
for the bachelor
and bachelorette
parties tonight.

17:13.206 --> 17:16.035
-What? No. I'm coming.
-Yeah, I want to go.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.428
It's Archie's bachelor party,
and I can't miss it.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.040
I would much rather crash
the bachelorette party.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.000
-[people screaming
and cheering]
-[hip hop music playing]

17:44.976 --> 17:45.977
Yeah!

17:50.895 --> 17:53.246
-How're you hanging in there?
-Yeah, good.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.773
You know, I'm not going to lie,
I've been thinking about
my dad a lot recently.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.080
He would've loved this.

18:01.123 --> 18:04.213
Me marrying Betty? Come on.
He would have been
beside himself. [chuckles]

18:07.347 --> 18:09.088
This is stupid, but I keep...

18:10.437 --> 18:13.004
I keep imagining...

18:13.048 --> 18:15.268
that, somehow,
he'll show up
for the wedding...

18:17.618 --> 18:20.099
He'd be standing
next to us, smiling.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.970
[Jughead] It's not
stupid, Arch.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.629
[mellow music playing]

18:32.067 --> 18:37.159
Come on, the night
is young. Let's dance.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.639
Who wants
to dance with me?

18:44.601 --> 18:47.778
Excellent. Thank you,
other Reggie.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.955
-I knew I could count on you.
-Mm-hmm.

18:50.999 --> 18:54.176
Come on, Reginald.
Don't be shy.

18:57.179 --> 19:01.401
You know, we could have
a sweet thing here,
the three of us.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.099
Nobody has to know.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.539
Sorry, Ronnie.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.979
I'm not used to sharing.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.069
Yeah, well, me neither.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.986
You know what, guys?

19:22.030 --> 19:25.207
The irony is, Veronica Lodge
is more woman

19:25.251 --> 19:27.688
than either of you
can handle alone.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.744
Thank you.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.093
Oh-ho-ho!

19:44.270 --> 19:46.533
Do you guys remember
when we were in high school,

19:46.576 --> 19:50.798
we'd party too hard
and be hung over,
and we could just skip class?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.626
Yeah, the good old days.

19:52.669 --> 19:56.195
[chuckles]
Being a teacher sucks.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.807
-[Cheryl] Oh, my God.
-Babe, what's wrong?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.200
My brother has been kidnapped

20:01.243 --> 20:03.202
by some lunatic calling himself
the Black Hood.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.164
What? Who's the Black Hood?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.644
How the hell
should I know, Cousin?

20:10.687 --> 20:12.472
But he's demanding
some insane ransom
and saying,

20:12.515 --> 20:14.343
if I don't pay,
he's going to kill my brother.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.348
Listen, Archie, I know
this is gonna sound nuts.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.916
I think I know where
Jason Blossom is being held.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.048
Is this another one of those
parallel universe things?

20:24.092 --> 20:26.877
Well, yeah.
But if the events of Riverdale

20:26.921 --> 20:29.489
are repeating here
in Rivervale, then...

20:29.532 --> 20:31.404
I think Jason Blossom
is being held at
the Whyte Wyrm.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.668
What do you want to do?

20:34.711 --> 20:37.192
Let's get Sheriff Keller
to back us up...

20:37.236 --> 20:38.237
and let's go save him.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.113
Jason, Jason...

20:46.941 --> 20:48.508
What the hell is going on here?

20:59.823 --> 21:01.956
[Jughead narrating]
It occurred to me that whoever
was under the mask

21:01.999 --> 21:04.785
was most likely the same person
who killed my double.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.224
Rivervale's big bad.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.444
Not Hiram Lodge, but...

21:12.662 --> 21:13.924
Clifford Blossom.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.414
[men grunting]

21:27.634 --> 21:30.419
Excuse me.
Are you kidding?

21:31.812 --> 21:33.596
Why aren't you dressed
for the rehearsal dinner?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.859
-Either of you?
-[both] He started it.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.079
I don't care who started it.

21:38.122 --> 21:43.345
I am so done with this macho,
toxic, competitive bull crap.

21:43.389 --> 21:47.131
We're all adults here.
So, we should be able
to act like we're adults.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.786
But until that happens,
you're both grounded.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.919
-What?
-No fair!

21:51.962 --> 21:55.444
You two need to work out
whatever it is you need to
work out in order to co-exist.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.925
You're out of the Pembrooke
and out of my life.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.016
[door opens]

22:02.059 --> 22:04.148
-[both] Idiot.
-[door closes]

22:04.192 --> 22:07.456
-[chattering indistinctly]
-[glass clinking]

22:07.500 --> 22:14.333
I want to thank everyone
for being here on this
very special occasion.

22:14.376 --> 22:19.120
It's not every night
that a mom gets to
host the rehearsal dinner

22:19.163 --> 22:23.646
for her daughter's wedding
to the finest young gentleman

22:23.690 --> 22:28.042
in this town, Archie Andrews.

22:28.085 --> 22:31.175
Now, I think my husband, Hal,
would like to say a few words.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.351
Just a few, though.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.830
[both chuckle]

22:33.874 --> 22:35.702
Thank you, Alice. Uh...

22:37.051 --> 22:40.141
I remember
when Betty was born, she...

22:40.184 --> 22:41.011
[door opens]

22:43.405 --> 22:47.278
Toni? What is it?
What's happened?

22:47.322 --> 22:49.150
[Jughead narrating] I knew it
even before Toni said it.

22:49.716 --> 22:50.804
She's dead.

22:53.894 --> 22:54.982
Who's dead, Toni?

22:55.548 --> 22:56.549
Cheryl.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.551
She was strangled.

23:00.944 --> 23:04.208
[Jughead] Betty and I went
to Thornhill straight from
the rehearsal dinner.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.254
The scene there
was a gruesome one.

23:06.297 --> 23:09.649
The rules of this universe
were making less sense
every day.

23:09.692 --> 23:13.043
It was as if Riverdale's
reality was trying to
reassert itself on Rivervale,

23:13.087 --> 23:15.219
and innocent people
like Cheryl were dying.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.265
How could I
take Dilton's advice
to do nothing?

23:17.918 --> 23:19.920
Wait a minute.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.532
Dilton. I've been wondering
who this universe's big bad is.

23:23.576 --> 23:27.884
Could it be meek Dilton Doiley
hiding in plain sight?

23:27.928 --> 23:31.061
Well, considering you're here
in the middle of the night,
I think it's time we talk.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.194
-A little busy
right now, Jughead.
-No.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.457
Dilton, you asked me
to sit down and do nothing.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.285
But it's happening again.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.766
The same events
that took place in Riverdale
are happening here!

23:40.941 --> 23:41.942
People are dying.

23:41.985 --> 23:44.074
Yes. Isn't it glorious?

23:44.118 --> 23:45.728
-What?
-[grunts]

23:47.948 --> 23:50.777
-Oh, you know
what's going on, don't you?
-He does.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.345
[Dilton] I'm sorry, Jughead.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.043
But I had to see
what would happen

23:56.086 --> 23:58.001
if the universes
remained conjoined.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.526
And now, we know.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.571
They've become
dangerously unstable,

24:02.615 --> 24:05.574
and eventually, they're both
going to implode.

24:05.618 --> 24:06.923
Why are they
going to implode?

24:06.967 --> 24:08.577
[Ethel] Riverdale
and Rivervale,

24:08.621 --> 24:10.274
the two universes
are expanding,

24:10.318 --> 24:11.624
as universes do.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.582
But they're still linked
at the point of creation.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.932
So, what? They're bleeding
into each other?

24:15.976 --> 24:17.934
They're just going to expand
into each other?

24:17.978 --> 24:20.241
And I, Dilton Doiley,

24:20.284 --> 24:22.635
will have a front row seat
to their destruction.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.941
I'll be the first scientist
to document

24:24.985 --> 24:28.336
a prime and pocket universe
collapsing in real time.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.992
How do we stop it?

24:32.035 --> 24:34.473
We don't. We can't.

24:35.691 --> 24:36.953
It's too late.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.564
[laughs]

24:38.607 --> 24:40.914
[coughing]

24:40.957 --> 24:42.829
[choking]

24:48.182 --> 24:50.053
[gasping]

24:54.318 --> 24:55.406
[Jughead] Ethel?

24:55.450 --> 24:57.539
I snuck poison
into his grape juice.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.280
Why?

24:59.323 --> 25:01.151
Because he was willing
to let everyone
in two universes die,

25:01.195 --> 25:03.066
just so he could study

25:03.110 --> 25:05.547
what happens when
the twin-versus implode.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.767
Ethel, do you know how to save
these universes?

25:09.943 --> 25:12.206
Of course I do, Jughead.

25:12.249 --> 25:15.731
Well, one of them,
the prime one,

25:17.864 --> 25:19.300
I can save Riverdale.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.564
Reggie?

25:26.220 --> 25:27.351
Reggies?

25:34.663 --> 25:35.664
[gasps]

25:37.710 --> 25:40.843
You dim, egotistical,

25:40.887 --> 25:43.019
narcissistic morons.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.593
When I said "Settle this,"
I didn't mean with a duel.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.471
That's the moment in time
the pocket universe,

26:00.515 --> 26:02.430
this universe, was created.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.475
If we could recreate
the circumstances
of its birth,

26:04.519 --> 26:05.868
then theoretically,
the same energy

26:05.912 --> 26:09.089
that conjoined them
could also separate them.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.570
We just need to figure out
what that moment was
and where?

26:11.613 --> 26:13.615
I think I know.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.878
Archie's bedroom,
when that bomb exploded.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.620
No, I think it would have to be
a more significant event
than just an explosion.

26:18.664 --> 26:19.926
That might not
sound like a lot,

26:19.969 --> 26:22.929
but it was a confluence
of good and evil.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.496
Archie and Betty's love,
Hiram's, hate.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.629
There was creation.
I was in the garage, writing,

26:27.673 --> 26:29.718
and destruction,
the explosion.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.199
There was science.
Archie had this...

26:32.242 --> 26:33.592
chunk of palladium
on his desk,

26:33.635 --> 26:34.897
and magic.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.769
Cheryl's curse on the town.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.771
That might definitely do it.

26:38.814 --> 26:42.078
Okay, so by your logic,

26:42.122 --> 26:45.342
we just have to accurately
recreate the events
in Archie's bedroom.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.084
As closely as we can.

26:48.128 --> 26:50.783
And the universes
should separate, yes,

26:50.826 --> 26:52.262
The prime universe
will stabilize,

26:52.306 --> 26:53.916
and our universe will...

26:56.136 --> 26:57.180
Cease to exist.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.708
Everyone in Rivervale
will die?

27:02.751 --> 27:07.408
Jughead, Rivervale
wasn't ever meant to exist.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.978
You, me, all of us,
our town, we're just...

27:13.719 --> 27:16.156
Aberrations.

27:16.199 --> 27:21.640
One, big, messy anomaly
that will simply stop being.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.730
And if we do nothing...

27:26.340 --> 27:27.907
both universes will collapse?

27:29.691 --> 27:30.736
Billions will die?

27:37.003 --> 27:39.658
So we just need to detonate
a bomb under Archie's bed.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.790
-With Betty and Archie in it.
-What?

27:41.834 --> 27:45.272
No, no, no.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.796
We're not blowing up
Archie and Betty.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.103
They're about to get married.

27:50.146 --> 27:53.759
We have to recreate
the circumstances
as closely as possible.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.891
I mean, if not
Betty and Archie,
then maybe it could be...

27:59.199 --> 28:01.331
Me and Veronica.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.725
What are we, if we're not
counterparts to Archie
and Betty?

28:05.118 --> 28:06.032
Ethel...

28:06.641 --> 28:07.642
you're brilliant.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.691
[Veronica] So if,
what you're saying is true,

28:13.256 --> 28:15.694
and we do this...

28:17.217 --> 28:19.219
we won't die?

28:20.568 --> 28:21.700
No.

28:21.743 --> 28:26.226
We'll... cease
to exist painlessly.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.880
All so Riverdale,

28:29.142 --> 28:33.015
a universe we don't even know
for sure exists,

28:33.059 --> 28:36.366
-can be spared.
-It does exist, Veronica.

28:36.410 --> 28:40.762
It's a universe
of high school dances,

28:40.806 --> 28:44.200
and masked serial killers,
of football, and milkshakes

28:44.244 --> 28:45.854
and musicals, and cults,

28:45.898 --> 28:48.727
diabolical board games
and murderous nuns.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.077
[sighs]

28:51.120 --> 28:53.209
It's a world where
billions of people will die

28:53.253 --> 28:55.603
if we don't split
the universes.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.044
All right.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.308
Let's do it.

29:05.352 --> 29:09.182
Let's make out
to save the universe.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.183
One thing.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.839
Can we do it
during the wedding?

29:13.882 --> 29:15.928
Because I'm not really
in the mood?

29:15.971 --> 29:17.973
Yeah, I hear that. Same.

29:19.496 --> 29:21.716
Here's to Vughead
becoming cannon.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.421
[Jughead narrating]
Is it possible
to be nostalgic for a life

29:31.465 --> 29:32.858
that you're not
even sure is yours.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.296
Flipping through the yearbook,
I remembered things

29:36.339 --> 29:38.341
as if I'd seen them
in a movie of my life.

29:38.385 --> 29:39.299
[door opening]

29:40.474 --> 29:41.823
All right, Lodge.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.129
We doing this or what?

29:47.568 --> 29:51.572
Archie, what are you
doing here?

29:51.615 --> 29:53.792
You know, when you didn't
show up to my wedding,

29:53.835 --> 29:56.229
I knew, you'd be doing
something stupid

29:56.272 --> 29:58.797
like trying to separate
the two universes.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.799
Well, I can't let you do that.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.279
Before you do anything final,

30:03.323 --> 30:04.933
know that Veronica
is on her way here right now.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.500
No, Jug, she's not.

30:07.980 --> 30:08.981
Ronnie's dead.

30:10.678 --> 30:11.853
-I killed her.
-[choking]

30:15.683 --> 30:16.684
What?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.078
Why would you do that?

30:19.121 --> 30:22.516
Because you told her the truth
about the universe,

30:22.559 --> 30:23.822
and she was gonna
help you destroy it.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.129
You killed Cheryl...

30:29.523 --> 30:30.785
and the other Jughead?

30:33.875 --> 30:35.834
Not Hiram or Clifford or Hal,

30:35.877 --> 30:36.965
you're Rivervale's Big Bad--

30:37.009 --> 30:38.924
I'm not a villain, Jug.

30:40.708 --> 30:41.840
No one stays dead here.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.800
Cheryl and Ronnie.
They'll be back.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.454
All the people we've lost...

30:50.196 --> 30:52.938
Everyone comes back to life
in this universe.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.029
Everyone comes back.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.032
Is this about your dad?

31:00.075 --> 31:01.381
Don't you get it?

31:04.340 --> 31:05.820
He's coming home.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.039
He has to.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.868
He would never
miss my wedding.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.695
Especially not to Betty,
he loved Betty.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.350
Archie, how do you
know all this?

31:14.394 --> 31:16.048
The rules of this world?

31:16.091 --> 31:17.658
How did you know
to kill the other Jughead

31:17.701 --> 31:18.964
before I even showed
you the comics?

31:19.007 --> 31:21.880
Bro, I know all the secrets
of this universe.

31:23.751 --> 31:27.146
I was at ground zero
for the birth of Rivervale.

31:27.189 --> 31:30.845
The moment of creation
and destruction.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.716
The threshold of revelation.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.024
I saw everything.

31:36.068 --> 31:39.767
The other Jughead, the dead,
coming back to life,

31:40.942 --> 31:42.683
the distortions.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.860
It's not a copy or a mistake

31:45.904 --> 31:47.166
like you think it is.

31:47.209 --> 31:49.690
It's another chance for me
to be with my dad.

31:50.604 --> 31:51.648
Archie...

31:51.692 --> 31:53.172
If we don't separate
these universes,

31:53.215 --> 31:56.740
and soon, everyone's
going to die in both of them.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.568
And you don't know
that Fred can come back.

31:58.612 --> 32:03.225
-Not everybody does--
-If there's a 0.001% chance

32:03.269 --> 32:04.357
that he will,

32:05.271 --> 32:07.447
I want to be here
waiting for him.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.755
I'm sorry.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.627
[both grunting]

32:23.289 --> 32:24.507
[coughing]

32:28.468 --> 32:29.425
[gasping]

32:29.469 --> 32:30.644
[gun fires]

32:31.471 --> 32:32.951
[Jughead gasping]

32:37.433 --> 32:39.305
[panting] Hey.

32:41.829 --> 32:44.745
Never leave a Cooper woman
standing at the altar.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.226
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

32:47.269 --> 32:49.271
How did you know
to come here?

32:49.315 --> 32:50.969
When Archie stood me up
at the altar,

32:51.012 --> 32:53.058
something clicked.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.408
I don't know, like,
my life flashed before my eyes.

32:55.451 --> 32:56.757
I knew to come here.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.454
You also know that
Rivervale should not exist.

33:00.804 --> 33:03.198
That bomb needs
to be detonated.

33:03.242 --> 33:04.504
By us?

33:06.245 --> 33:07.159
If you're willing.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.336
[clock ticking]

33:12.077 --> 33:13.513
What we do now.
We just wait?

33:13.556 --> 33:15.645
No. We need to recreate
the moments before

33:15.689 --> 33:17.691
the original explosions
closely as possible.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.475
Oh, well, Archie and I...

33:19.519 --> 33:22.130
I know, I read it
in the comics.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.885
[knocking at door]

33:38.494 --> 33:40.018
Hey. Whoa.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.671
Hey, sorry. Look...

33:41.715 --> 33:43.543
There may be a way
to separate the two universes

33:43.586 --> 33:44.848
without erasing this one.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.850
Okay?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.287
Well, we should probably
stop the bomb. Betty,
could you please disarm it?

33:48.330 --> 33:49.505
What I'm... What?

33:49.549 --> 33:50.985
I don't know
how to disarm a bomb.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.031
Yes, you do.
You went to the FBI Academy.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.293
You've actually
done it before,

33:54.336 --> 33:55.859
when Polly had a bomb
strapped to her body

33:57.339 --> 33:58.732
[timer ticking]

34:00.734 --> 34:02.518
You came back
from the dead too.

34:02.562 --> 34:03.867
Where were you

34:03.911 --> 34:07.088
after Archie strangled you?

34:07.132 --> 34:10.004
The great Pop's Chock'lit
Shoppe in the sky.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.528
[bell jingles]

34:12.572 --> 34:14.574
[50's rock and roll
music playing]

34:18.926 --> 34:20.319
From the second I walked
through that door,

34:20.362 --> 34:22.712
I immediately felt at peace.

34:22.756 --> 34:25.019
The sweet Hereafter Pops
is a lot like ours,

34:25.063 --> 34:26.977
except it also sells comics.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.157
It's like one of those
old fashioned soda shops.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.420
Everything about this Pops
is old-fashioned.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.900
Grab something to read,
and have a seat.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.773
It's all you can eat.
On the house, of course.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.434
And that's when I found it.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.871
A special comic book

34:50.914 --> 34:54.744
that came in between
issues 95 and 96,

34:54.788 --> 34:58.096
and it bridged the gap between
Riverdale and Rivervale.

34:58.139 --> 35:01.011
It told the tale of two
linked universes

35:01.055 --> 35:02.796
and how,
if that second universe

35:02.839 --> 35:05.581
were to become separated
from the first, it would die.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.367
Unless a new power source
could be found and maintained.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.851
I was looking around
at all these comic books.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.592
All these wonderful stories

35:16.636 --> 35:18.681
made me realize what that
power source could be.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.033
And so I resurrected,
and I came right here.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.470
What is the other
power source

35:24.513 --> 35:26.124
that's going to fuel Rivervale
after it separates?

35:30.476 --> 35:31.520
Imagination.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.610
It's limitless
and all powerful,

35:34.654 --> 35:36.786
it's boundless
and ever replenishing.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.180
There's no fuel more potent,

35:39.224 --> 35:40.790
no generator
more awesome.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.270
I don't understand.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.967
I think I do.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.448
The explosion
is destruction, right?

35:46.492 --> 35:48.494
What's the opposite
of destruction?

35:48.537 --> 35:51.105
-Creation.
-Exactly.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.237
I mean, it's all the comics,

35:52.280 --> 35:54.326
how Jughead here
is gonna save Rivervale

35:54.369 --> 35:55.849
by becoming a living battery.

35:56.676 --> 36:00.375
-A, um--
-Story generator?

36:00.419 --> 36:04.162
That powers Rivervale
by writing the stories
that fuel the universe?

36:04.205 --> 36:06.207
So it doesn't have to keep
leeching off of Riverdale.

36:07.556 --> 36:11.473
It's an over-simplification,
but, yeah, you write,

36:11.517 --> 36:12.735
and Rivervale lives.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.652
One thing though,
once you start producing,

36:16.696 --> 36:18.524
you will have to be
in complete isolation.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.573
I mean, think about if someone
saw two Jugheads

36:24.617 --> 36:29.317
just walking and talking,
it could actually
break down reality, so...

36:29.361 --> 36:31.058
Well, no. No!

36:31.101 --> 36:32.190
Then why can't you do it?

36:34.409 --> 36:35.497
I'm the narrator.

36:35.541 --> 36:36.585
He's the writer.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.326
What does that mean?
This isn't fair!

36:38.370 --> 36:39.588
No! It's...

36:40.894 --> 36:42.722
[sighs]
It's how it has to be...

36:44.245 --> 36:47.030
if everyone is going to live,
our family, our friends.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.163
This is why I became aware,
isn't it?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.165
Because I'm both inside
and outside of the story.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.733
In the end, the universe knew
I'd be the only one
capable of saving it.

36:55.387 --> 36:56.214
All right.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.391
Where do I set up shop?

36:59.434 --> 37:00.827
Dilton's bunker?

37:00.870 --> 37:03.177
Your typewriter is already
down there.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.310
You'll have plenty of paper
and tons of food.

37:05.353 --> 37:09.052
And once you're settled,
we'll, uh, seal you in.

37:09.096 --> 37:12.969
This is insane.
I will not be able to live
with myself, Jug.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.537
Actually, you will, in time.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.932
Well, very quickly, actually.

37:18.975 --> 37:23.458
Soon you will forget all about
Jughead's sacrifice for you
and for us,

37:23.502 --> 37:25.155
and he will fade from memory.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.724
[whispers] Oh, my gosh!

37:28.768 --> 37:30.944
-This is--
-Hey, Hey! Look at me.

37:33.425 --> 37:34.730
I need you to be strong.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.471
Please.

37:36.515 --> 37:38.647
I need you in my corner
for this one.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.127
Make sure that bomb goes off.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.260
Jughead.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.740
It's gonna be okay.

37:45.741 --> 37:46.568
Really.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.269
We got this. You and me.

37:53.662 --> 37:54.924
Saving the universes.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.811
[narrator Jughead] It was
at this moment, that Jughead
and Betty began, yet again,

38:11.854 --> 38:13.943
the doomsday clock's countdown.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.945
[clock ticking]

38:15.989 --> 38:18.165
While in the living room,

38:18.208 --> 38:21.342
Archie Andrews reanimated
and resumed his mission
to stop Jughead.

38:25.346 --> 38:28.523
Hey, Cooper,
whatever happens...

38:29.655 --> 38:31.221
We'll face it together.

38:31.265 --> 38:33.093
[doorknob rattling]

38:37.489 --> 38:39.099
[pounding on door]

38:39.142 --> 38:40.622
[narrator Jughead] There was
nothing to do but wait.

38:40.666 --> 38:41.971
Betty and Jughead
held each other tightly,

38:42.015 --> 38:44.844
like children
terrified of the dark.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.631
As the bomb's counter
finally reached zero,

38:49.675 --> 38:52.460
Betty and Jughead
braced themselves for
an explosion that should have

38:52.504 --> 38:54.419
obliterated one
or more universes.

38:54.462 --> 38:55.637
But instead...

38:57.160 --> 38:58.336
never happened.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.347
The bomb was gone.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.653
The pounding on the door
had ceased.

39:11.697 --> 39:15.135
And Betty and Jughead
realized that the storm
had passed them by.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.399
They survived.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.879
They could resume their lives.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.579
[people chattering
indistinctly]

39:25.537 --> 39:27.234
There you guys are.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.018
We were just about to send
a search party.

39:29.062 --> 39:32.413
Seriously! What were you guys
doing up there?

39:32.457 --> 39:36.504
-Um... [chuckles nervously]
-I actually can't remember.

39:36.548 --> 39:38.419
Don't mind him.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.856
He always turns into
a space cadet when he's working
on a new novel.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.336
[chuckles]

39:44.120 --> 39:46.688
No, seriously, what were we...
What were we doing?

39:46.732 --> 39:48.473
Oh, come on, Betty.
Your spaghetti's
gonna get cold.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.173
-Hi.
-Hey. Thank you.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.610
[kisses]

39:55.654 --> 39:57.003
[narrator Jughead]
After dinner,
Jughead and Tabitha

39:57.046 --> 39:58.700
will start moving
his belongings

39:58.744 --> 40:01.094
out of Archie's garage
and into their new apartment.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.664
Including a comic book
collection,

40:05.707 --> 40:08.188
Jughead had forgotten
that he had.

40:08.231 --> 40:11.713
And though he will not
know it in the moment,
this collection of comic books

40:11.757 --> 40:14.368
and the secrets contained
within its pages

40:14.412 --> 40:18.720
will one day save his
and countless others' lives.

40:18.764 --> 40:21.070
[Ethel] So it worked.

40:21.114 --> 40:24.726
Rivervale will continue
to exist in an endless
time loop you created,

40:24.770 --> 40:26.554
as long as you keep typing.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.077
Luckily, I've got
a lot of stories.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.908
One question, though.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.303
What happens in
the prime Riverdale universe?

40:37.739 --> 40:38.740
[sighs]

40:40.438 --> 40:43.266
Guess we'll never know
if someone did something

40:43.310 --> 40:45.704
to change the course
of events in Riverdale.

40:51.797 --> 40:53.799
[romantic music playing]

41:08.814 --> 41:11.599
-[cell phone ringing]
-[clock ticking faintly]

41:11.643 --> 41:12.470
Can you hear that?

41:14.994 --> 41:16.386
[sighs] It's my phone.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.348
-Hello.
-[man] Get out of
that house, Betty!

41:22.349 --> 41:23.872
Who is this?

41:23.916 --> 41:25.613
Listen to me,
there's a bomb under the bed.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.659
You have to go now,
right now!

41:29.530 --> 41:30.662
We have to go.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.533
Now.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.190
-[explosion]
-[glass shatters]

41:41.629 --> 41:44.023
[ears ringing]

41:51.030 --> 41:52.858
[imperceptible]
