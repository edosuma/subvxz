02:04.891 --> 02:06.119
Scissors.

02:10.597 --> 02:11.723
Clamp.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.135
-O.R.
-Dr. Rogers for Dr. Carson.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.502
Doctor?

02:23.343 --> 02:24.833
-Yes?
-Ben, it's Mark.

02:24.944 --> 02:28.436
I need to see you up in my office.
A special-needs case just came in.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.072
Okay. Soon as I'm done.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.343
They were born by cesarean
3 months ago,

02:34.454 --> 02:37.150
and, against all odds, they're still alive.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.124
Their physician from West Germany
called me this morning.

02:44.364 --> 02:49.301
Occipital cranopagus twins
have never both survived a separation.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.097
Yeah. He knows that.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.941
If they're not separated...

03:00.780 --> 03:04.716
they'll spend the rest of their lives in bed,
on their backs.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.553
The hospital wants me
to fly to Germany and examine them.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.054
Ben, are you gonna do this?

03:16.162 --> 03:17.720
Nobody's ever done it.

03:19.265 --> 03:23.292
In situations like this, one baby always dies.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.064
Welcome to Germany.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.804
We've been anxiously awaiting
your arrival, Dr. Carson.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.508
Allow me to introduce
Peter and Augusta Rausch.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.451
Thank you for coming.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.077
-How do you do, Doctor?
-My pleasure.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.656
And this is Johann and Stefan.

04:20.026 --> 04:23.587
I wanted to kill myself
when I learned the truth,

04:23.696 --> 04:27.154
but I realized I would be killing
2 other beings, too.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.894
And then, as soon as I saw them,
my heart melted.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.601
Please don't ask us to choose between them.

04:40.313 --> 04:44.249
Well, they don't appear to be sharing
any organs, which is good.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.712
Though there are parts of the brain,
such as the vision center,

04:48.821 --> 04:51.119
that aren't completely separated.

04:51.724 --> 04:55.353
-We won't know until we get on there.
-How soon can that be?

04:55.461 --> 05:00.023
Well, first we have to solve the problem
of exsanguinations.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.601
-Exsan...
-Bleeding to death.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.371
It's the reason why cranial separations
have never succeeded.

05:09.409 --> 05:13.004
You see, babes have very little blood,

05:14.080 --> 05:18.039
and unless I can figure out a way
to keep them from bleeding out,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.581
I can't risk performing this operation.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.183
I'll do it.

06:35.695 --> 06:36.753
Good.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.696
Thank you. I'll notify the doctor in Germany.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.962
We'll schedule the operation
for a month from now?

06:43.102 --> 06:45.070
Make it 2. Make it 4.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.533
Still haven't figured out
how to save them both, huh?

06:50.643 --> 06:51.610
I'm working on it.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.498
Number 12, 14. Number 13, 27.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.490
Number 12, 14. Number 13, 27.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.696
Number 15, 33.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.041
All right, class,
hand your test back to your neighbor.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.846
All right, how many did you get right?

07:30.950 --> 07:31.939
Kathy?

07:32.051 --> 07:35.248
-25.
-That's excellent, Kathy.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.885
-Mark?
-30.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.117
Good for you, Mark. You got them all right.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.986
Benjamin?

07:44.730 --> 07:47.631
Benjamin, how many did you get right?

07:47.733 --> 07:49.724
-None.
-Nine?

07:49.836 --> 07:52.703
Why, Benjamin, that's wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.331
Not nine, Mss Williamson. He got none.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.917
You'd think he'd get at least one right.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.961
He got one right last time, 'cause he was
trying to put down the wrong answer.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.459
Hey, Carson, we know
you're the dumbest kid in the class,

08:21.567 --> 08:24.035
but did you hear what they sad on Cronkite
last night on the news?

08:24.136 --> 08:26.195
You're the dumbest kid in the world.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.069
He hit him! He hit him!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.208
Bennie, how could this have been
an accident?

08:33.312 --> 08:35.644
Well, it was almost an accident.

08:36.749 --> 08:40.582
Mom, I never would have hit him
if I remembered I had the lock in my hand.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.857
The boy had 5 stitches,
and his parents are very upset.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.352
I'm not sure how to discipline your son,
Mrs. Carson.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.951
I'll handle it.

08:50.062 --> 08:54.089
I'm also very concerned about his grades.
Have you seen his latest report card?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.404
So, what happened? You weren't getting
grades like that in Boston.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.267
Boston was easier.
They didn't ask us to do much.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.745
Well, I ain't asking you, either,
I'm telling you.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.180
You weren't meant to be a failure, Bennie.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.911
-And you can control your temper.
-He called me a dummy...

09:13.019 --> 09:15.112
And you can bring your grades up, too.
I know you can.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.052
-I'm dumb, Mother.
-No, you ain't.

09:17.156 --> 09:21.149
You're a smart boy.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.751
You just ain't using that smartness.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.154
Now, if you keep getting grades like that,

09:26.265 --> 09:28.495
you're gonna spend the rest of your life
mopping floors in a factory.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.069
And that ain't the life I want for you.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.604
That ain't the life God wants for you, ether.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.738
Yes, Mother.

09:37.109 --> 09:40.670
I'm gonna have to have a talk with him
about you and your brother, Curtis.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.915
No, no. He invited us
to the game tonight, remember?

09:46.018 --> 09:49.454
Why don't you and I go?
And get me Candlestick Park, please.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.619
Hey, Mother. You're home early.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.787
They didn't need me
as long as they sad they would.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.490
You finish your homework?

10:01.834 --> 10:03.165
Most of it.

10:03.836 --> 10:08.034
Bennie, you're gonna run your eyes
sitting so close to this TV.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.172
-You do your homework?
-I need help.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.178
-Curtis, help your brother.
-I gotta finish my math.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.846
Mother, I need help.

10:20.620 --> 10:25.614
-What you need help with?
-This history. I don't really understand it.

10:25.725 --> 10:31.027
-Well, what don't you understand?
-Like, all the words.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.722
Could you read this for me?

10:35.635 --> 10:39.571
I need new reading glasses.
Why don't you tell me what it's about?

10:39.672 --> 10:42.300
It's about Thomas Jefferson
and the Declaration of Independence.

10:43.943 --> 10:47.242
-What is this word?
-Sound it out.

10:50.916 --> 10:55.114
''self... Self...

10:55.221 --> 10:58.622
''And it...''

11:00.092 --> 11:02.287
-Self...
-Look at me.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.190
Can you tell me what them
cereal boxes is on the shelf?

11:10.302 --> 11:11.360
Sure.

11:12.071 --> 11:16.474
-I mean, can you read them?
-Not this far. Can you?

11:27.386 --> 11:31.186
Looks like I ain't the only one around here
gonna be needing glasses.

11:33.659 --> 11:40.565
Tina, Sarah, Kathy, Bennie.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.967
Congratulations. You're doing much better.

11:47.673 --> 11:48.901
Yes!

11:50.843 --> 11:56.713
Well, it's an improvement, all right.
And I'm proud of you for not getting an F.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.511
You're a smart boy.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.876
-But you both can do better.
-I'm doing the best I can, Mother.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.114
-How? I don't know how.
-Well, I don't know how.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.088
We're just gonna have to use
our imagination.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.921
I don't got one.

12:08.027 --> 12:11.519
Of course you do.
everybody got an imagination.

12:11.630 --> 12:14.064
-Not me.
-Of course you do.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.896
Listen to me. If I say,

12:17.937 --> 12:20.735
''Once upon a time,
there was a little blue mouse,''

12:20.840 --> 12:23.206
don't you see a little blue mouse?

12:23.309 --> 12:25.038
-No.
-Bennie.

12:25.144 --> 12:28.477
-Mother, my brain's too dumb.
-Boy, your brain ain't dumb.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.912
It is, Mom.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.714
You got all the world in here.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.618
You just got to see beyond
what you can see.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.427
-What is this, a race of some kind?
-Betty, slow down.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.399
You act as though this were your last meal.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.438
We've got to write your
contest essay tonight, Father.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.372
Oh, well, in that case,
maybe you had better hurry.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.035
-Don't choke.
-I'll get it.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.612
I never saw it to fail.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.375
Every time we sit down to eat,
the phone rings.

13:03.482 --> 13:07.885
I know how to stop it, Daddy.
When the phone bill comes, don't pay it.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.055
-Not a bad idea.
-That was Joe Philips, Dad.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.182
He wants me to come up
to his uncle's farm this weekend.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.022
-Isn't that great?
-But how are you gonna get there?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.096
Joe's got a license. We could drive.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.394
The last time he took a trip,
he wrecked his dad's car.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.297
Whose car is he figuring on wrecking
this time?

13:23.402 --> 13:24.562
Yours.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.768
-He thought...
-I know what he thought.

13:27.873 --> 13:31.331
But I wouldn't trust Joe Philips
with a pogo stick.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.812
Please, Dad. I'll be careful.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.613
How can you be careful if he's driving?

13:40.719 --> 13:42.710
You never let me do anything.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.619
I'm not gonna let you do this.

13:44.723 --> 13:48.625
-You'd think I was a juvenile or something.
-When you act this way, you are.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.491
-Now eat your dinner.
-I'm not hungry.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.762
Then excuse yourself and leave the table.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.560
Mother, come on, we'll be late for church.

14:23.562 --> 14:26.053
You all go on ahead without me, honey.

14:27.766 --> 14:30.030
Mama's having one of her days.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.003
All right.

14:45.751 --> 14:51.451
I'm reminded of the story
of the missionary doctor and his wife

14:51.557 --> 14:55.152
who were surprised by bandits.

14:55.895 --> 15:00.298
You see, these thieves were terrible men.

15:01.033 --> 15:07.199
Bloodthirsty. Vicious.
They not only robbed their victims,

15:07.706 --> 15:12.541
they slit their throats and laughed
as they watched them de.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.112
You all don't hear me.

15:14.213 --> 15:18.081
This poor doctor and his wife
ran for their lives

15:18.183 --> 15:21.778
as the thieves chased them
across rocky, barren land.

15:21.887 --> 15:25.414
These missionaries' feet
were cut open by sharp stones.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.719
Their clothes were torn by brambles,

15:27.826 --> 15:32.195
and, finally, they came upon a great fortress,

15:32.298 --> 15:35.131
but the Bandit King was right behind them.

15:37.036 --> 15:41.370
The doctor ran up to the front door
of the fortress and tried to open it.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.031
But it was locked.

15:43.142 --> 15:48.307
If only someone would let them in.
No one was there.

15:48.948 --> 15:54.750
And the doctor and his wife hid, but the
Bandit King saw them and drew his sword.

15:54.853 --> 15:58.721
There appeared to be nothing
that could save God's good people.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.795
The Bandit King was after me,
and so I hid under some straw,

16:10.903 --> 16:13.201
and a blue mouse came out
and scared his horse.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.536
And I got away. I saw it in my brain.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.237
That's good.
That's your imagination working.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.472
But it was real, it was really real.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.242
-Did I say it wasn't real?
-It's not real.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.545
-That's why it's called imagination, dummy.
-Shut up.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.210
Watch your mouth, Curtis.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.279
Mother, I want to be a doctor.

16:31.390 --> 16:34.621
A missionary doctor, just like the one
Pastor Ford told us about.

16:34.727 --> 16:38.060
You can be anything you want to be
in this life,

16:38.163 --> 16:40.358
as long as you're willing to work at it.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.898
That goes for you, too, Curtis.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.062
God will not abandon you.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.479
excuse me.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.648
I need to talk to someone.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.885
I have a darkness I can't control.

17:12.897 --> 17:17.300
Come with me, ma'am.
Let's see if we can help you. All right?

17:23.909 --> 17:25.877
I've spent my childhood in foster care.

17:27.346 --> 17:32.682
When my husband, Mr. Carson, marred me,
he was my ticket out of there.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.879
-How old were you?
-13.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.922
We were happy.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.817
We had a lovely home, 2 beautiful boys.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.190
Then what?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.334
I don't like to talk about it.

18:01.947 --> 18:04.882
He had another wife and kids.

18:09.455 --> 18:12.015
When I found out, my life fell apart.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.715
When was this, Mrs. Carson?

18:19.164 --> 18:20.722
5 years back.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.695
But I couldn't leave my husband
'cause my boys needed their daddy

18:25.804 --> 18:28.671
and I didn't know
how I'd make it on my own.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.705
-Are you still together?
-No.

18:33.645 --> 18:37.137
I found out he was dealing drugs,
so me and the boys moved to Boston.

18:37.249 --> 18:40.480
-I've got a sister there.
-Why'd you come back to Detroit?

18:40.586 --> 18:45.683
I got the house in the divorce, and I kept it.
I rent it out for income,

18:47.226 --> 18:50.059
but I've been saving money in a cookie jar,

18:50.863 --> 18:53.263
and me and my boys
are gonna move back in.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.797
-How do you support yourself?
-I clean houses, and I baby-sit.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.161
That's about all I can do.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.675
Nobody knows this.

19:15.087 --> 19:19.285
I'm so dumb, I can't even read.

19:24.329 --> 19:28.891
And I fear my boys
are gonna turn out the same way.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.966
And nothing's gonna work out.

19:34.773 --> 19:39.039
I try to fight these feelings.
I don't show them to Bennie and Curtis.

19:40.779 --> 19:45.113
But, lately, I can't stop them.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.280
I even think about killing myself.

19:55.994 --> 20:01.022
Mrs. Carson, what would you say
to checking yourself in with us?

20:03.135 --> 20:04.124
-No.
-Just for a little while.

20:04.236 --> 20:08.696
-I can't afford to do anything like...
-Don't think about the money.

20:09.675 --> 20:10.972
We'll find the money.

20:27.025 --> 20:30.392
Boys, I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.292
What? What do you mean?

20:32.397 --> 20:34.661
-Where?
-Just for a few weeks.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.997
I'm going back to Boston
to see your aunt Jean Avery.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.094
-Can't we come with you?
-No.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.003
You got school. You got homework.

20:43.709 --> 20:47.201
-So, you're just gonna leave us alone?
-Of course not.

20:48.046 --> 20:50.514
Sister Scott is gonna come
and stay with you.

20:53.085 --> 20:57.920
In the meantime,
I want you boys to do me a favor.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.293
I want you both to learn
your times tables while I'm gone.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.361
-What?
-No way!

21:03.462 --> 21:04.952
You can do it.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.258
Do you know how many there are?

21:07.366 --> 21:10.767
-That could take a year.
-Won't take my boys a year. You're smart.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.167
Not that smart. Nobody can memorize them.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.866
I did, and I just went to the third grade.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.272
-But it's hard work.
-Well,

21:20.012 --> 21:21.809
hard work ain't never hurt nobody.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.082
Besides, you ain't going outside to play
till you learn them tables.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.117
Wait. Mother, please, no.
Come on, that's not far.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.552
Come on, Mother.
You're the meanest mom in the world.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.725
-5 times 4.
-30.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.358
-No.
-31?

21:44.469 --> 21:46.369
This isn't a guessing game, Bennie.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.598
Bennie, listen to your brother.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.206
-Here you are, Mrs. Philiman.
-Thank you.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.485
-Mildred?
-No.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.818
-Kathy?
-22.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.630
-Mark?
-25 out of 25.

22:47.733 --> 22:48.995
excellent.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.200
Benjamin?

22:51.737 --> 22:53.728
-Benjamin?
-I didn't cheat.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.808
I didn't say you did. What's your score?

22:58.076 --> 22:59.805
24 out of 25.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.672
Sister Scott! Sister Scott!

23:05.684 --> 23:06.673
I got an A!

23:06.785 --> 23:07.752
I got an A.

23:08.253 --> 23:10.050
Sister Scott! Sister Scott!

23:13.725 --> 23:17.024
I got... Mother!

23:18.630 --> 23:23.795
-I missed you. I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

23:25.036 --> 23:28.494
I know all my times tables.
I got them all right, except for one.

23:28.607 --> 23:32.839
Let me see. I knew you could do it.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.944
I knew you could do it.

23:45.991 --> 23:49.654
Professor Burket,
I'm Mrs. Carson, your new cleaning woman.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.395
-Mrs. Carson.
-Sir?

24:30.502 --> 24:32.902
-The kitchen floor.
-What about it?

24:34.372 --> 24:35.737
It sparkles.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.673
Well, your last cleaning lady
didn't do a very good job.

24:39.778 --> 24:42.042
What I do, I do the best I can.

24:43.081 --> 24:45.276
The last cleaning lady was me.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.387
My late wife was very sick.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.217
I took care of her and not much else.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.295
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.059
Sr.

25:05.670 --> 25:10.630
-Did you read all these books?
-Most of them. Why?

25:13.044 --> 25:14.477
Just curious.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.377
Take the rest of your men off the post.

25:18.483 --> 25:21.611
They can stay with Corporal Dolan's family
in Salt Lake till Barker's gone.

25:21.753 --> 25:23.345
-Yes, sir.
-Come to think of it,

25:23.455 --> 25:25.355
-you better stay there yourself.
-Yes, sir.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.785
-Hey, why'd you do that for?
-What's going on? I was watching that.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.054
You boys watch too much television.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.458
-Not that much.
-No more than everybody else.

25:31.563 --> 25:35.499
Don't worry about everybody else.
This whole world is full of everybody else.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.970
From now on, you're gonna pick 3,
no, 2 pre-selected programs per week.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.597
-A week?
-You're crazy. I mean, this is crazy.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.733
And that's after you finish your homework.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.402
What are we gonna do
with all our free time?

25:47.512 --> 25:51.642
I'm glad you asked. You're gonna go
to the library and pick out 2 books,

25:51.750 --> 25:52.774
and, at the end of the week,

25:52.884 --> 25:55.114
you're gonna hand me a written report
about what you read.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.211
-2 books a week?
-I don't believe what you're saying.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.721
-I can't even read one.
-We cannot possibly survive

25:58.823 --> 26:01.291
-without television.
-Well, you're gonna start now.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.361
Why you waste all that time
watching the TV?

26:03.461 --> 26:06.157
If you used that time to develop
your God-given gifts,

26:06.264 --> 26:09.199
it wouldn't be long before
folks was watching you on TV.

26:38.897 --> 26:42.560
-Man, there's a lot of books in here.
-Shut up, boy. It's a library.

27:18.103 --> 27:22.802
''Hearing the great roar made the young man
wonder if he had chosen wisely.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.340
''Maybe it was a trick.

27:24.442 --> 27:28.811
''Was there really a tiger,
or just a recording of a tiger's roar?

27:28.913 --> 27:31.905
''Maybe there was a tiger
behind the other door,

27:32.017 --> 27:35.453
''and he'd de like
all the other princes before him.''

27:35.553 --> 27:37.851
That's good, Bennie. That's real good.

27:37.956 --> 27:41.289
Mother, what's this word?

27:45.263 --> 27:48.027
I need to get new reading glasses.
Sound it out.

27:49.968 --> 27:54.064
Ag... Ag...

27:54.939 --> 28:00.605
Agriculture. A-G-R-I-C-U-L-T-U-R-E.

28:00.712 --> 28:03.647
-Agriculture.
-excellent, Benjamin.

28:03.748 --> 28:06.012
Kathy. ''Combine.''

28:06.117 --> 28:10.645
Combine. C-O-M-B-I-N-E. Combine.

28:10.755 --> 28:14.691
For a 20-point bonus, here's your toss-up.
You know, several limericks begin,

28:14.793 --> 28:17.489
''there was a young lady from Perth. ''

28:17.595 --> 28:21.258
Limerick is in Ireland.
For 10 points, where is Perth?

28:21.366 --> 28:22.333
Australia.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.698
Wow. How could they know so much?

28:24.803 --> 28:26.464
-Right, for 10 points.
-I don't know.

28:27.706 --> 28:31.733
And, finally, for 10 points,
what poet describes...

28:40.618 --> 28:42.518
Bennie, come on, we're gonna be late.

28:59.437 --> 29:03.373
excuse me.
Do you have any books on rocks?

29:11.382 --> 29:12.747
Okay, class,

29:13.785 --> 29:19.189
what about this one?
Does anybody know what this is?

29:22.427 --> 29:23.655
Anybody?

29:29.667 --> 29:31.931
Yes, Benjamin,

29:33.972 --> 29:35.735
can you identify this rock?

29:39.110 --> 29:43.604
-It's obsidine.
-Obsidian. That's right.

29:44.082 --> 29:45.572
Do you know how it was made?

29:45.683 --> 29:50.450
Well, it was formed after a volcanic eruption,

29:50.555 --> 29:53.718
by the supercooling of the lava
when it hits the water.

29:53.825 --> 29:58.228
The volcano erupts,
and the lava flows down red hot.

29:58.329 --> 30:02.459
So, when it hits the water,
the elements coalesce,

30:02.567 --> 30:06.230
and since that water is cold,
the air is forced out,

30:06.337 --> 30:10.467
and the surface glazes over,
and the lava becomes hard,

30:11.176 --> 30:16.375
and that makes obsidine.
I mean obsidian, sorry.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.911
May I see you after class?

30:26.057 --> 30:28.252
-What happened?
-I'm sorry.

30:28.359 --> 30:31.055
What are you sorry for?
Someone unlocked the door.

30:32.063 --> 30:33.496
Look at this.

30:52.550 --> 30:53.847
You know what that is?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.454
That's a whole other world, Benjamin.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.489
You just stepped into a whole other world.

31:09.701 --> 31:14.832
Magnitude. M-A-G-N-I-T-U-D-E. Magnitude.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.200
Mark. ''Perpetuate.''

31:18.476 --> 31:19.909
Perpetuate.

31:22.547 --> 31:28.179
''the feast

31:28.920 --> 31:34.290
''of unleavened...

31:34.726 --> 31:36.887
''the un...''

31:36.995 --> 31:39.862
-Unleavened.
-Unleavened.

31:39.964 --> 31:40.931
Yeah.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.562
B, come on. I gotta go.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.733
Bennie, are you in there?

31:49.841 --> 31:54.744
What potion had a sort of mixed flavor
of cherry tart, custard, pineapple...

31:54.846 --> 31:56.575
Alice In Wonderland.

31:56.681 --> 31:58.478
The potion
which Alice in Wonderland drank,

31:58.583 --> 32:00.744
which made her grow into various sizes.

32:00.852 --> 32:05.482
Tell me, when Cain settled down
east of Eden, in what land did he live?

32:05.957 --> 32:07.117
-In the land of Nod!
-In the land of Nod.

32:07.225 --> 32:10.592
Right. For 10 points.
How many tales in The Canterbury Tales?

32:10.728 --> 32:12.161
-24.
-Right.

32:12.697 --> 32:16.030
20-point bonus. A 20-point bonus
coming up. Here's your toss-up.

32:16.134 --> 32:21.231
A leading major-league baseball player
and the layer of the earth between...

32:21.339 --> 32:23.000
Mantle. Mickey Mantle.

32:23.141 --> 32:25.166
Right. Between the crust and the core...

32:26.811 --> 32:28.438
Wow, you were there before
I had the question.

32:28.546 --> 32:30.036
Okay. Rutgers, for 20 points.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.711
-''saunter.''
-Saunter.

32:33.351 --> 32:37.412
S-A-U-N-T-E-R. Saunter.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.750
-''Lacquer.''
-Lacquer.

32:41.859 --> 32:46.694
L-A-C-K-E-R. Lacquer.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.098
Sorry, Cliff.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.869
Benjamin, if you spell it correctly, you win.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.334
Lacquer.

32:56.908 --> 33:01.607
L-A-C-Q-U-E-R. Lacquer.

33:02.814 --> 33:07.751
-That is correct.
-Yes! Yes!

33:09.153 --> 33:12.020
The certificate for the student
with the highest academic achievement

33:12.123 --> 33:15.820
in the 8th grade
goes to Benjamin Carson.

33:30.475 --> 33:33.569
Before Benjamin takes his seat,
I have a few words I want to say.

33:34.812 --> 33:36.541
Benjamin is a boy of color.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.510
He has no father in his life.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.848
He comes to us
with tremendous disadvantages.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.785
There's no reason
you shouldn't have done better than him.

33:44.889 --> 33:48.655
What's wrong with you kids?
You're not trying hard enough.

33:51.129 --> 33:52.960
You should be ashamed.

34:15.286 --> 34:22.021
The certificate for outstanding
citizenship goes to Alexia Courtney.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.333
Right, for 10 points.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.866
All right, here's a 20-point bonus, Brandeis.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.774
Identify the composer.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.012
-Vivaldi.
-That's right, for 10 points.

34:49.520 --> 34:54.617
This picture by Monet would be classified
as French Impressionism.

34:54.725 --> 34:58.855
For 10 points, how is this picture classified?

34:58.963 --> 35:01.431
-Primitive American.
-That's right.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.215
Turn off that thing!

35:29.327 --> 35:32.353
-I'll turn it down.
-No, I like it. Turn it up.

35:33.898 --> 35:36.059
Won't Mrs. Graham
knock on the ceiling again?

35:36.167 --> 35:38.829
Let her knock. We're moving.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.138
We're moving?

35:43.007 --> 35:46.670
That speech your 8th-grade teacher gave
ticked me off, so I went to the bank.

35:47.245 --> 35:48.576
I've finally saved up enough money

35:48.679 --> 35:50.806
to take back that house
we've been renting out.

35:50.915 --> 35:55.113
So, starting next fall, you're going
to a school that appreciates you.

36:15.873 --> 36:19.673
Hey, Carl, you heard what Goodwill did
with all the clothes so old and so ugly

36:19.777 --> 36:22.211
-even the winos didn't want them?
-What?

36:22.313 --> 36:24.406
They gave them to New Blood over there.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.561
Do we have any money left?

36:48.606 --> 36:51.097
-What do you mean?
-I need clothes for school.

36:52.276 --> 36:55.473
-You got clothes for school.
-Old clothes.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.880
-Good clothes.
-Not good enough for Hunter High.

36:58.983 --> 37:02.043
I've seen the clothes them kids wear.
They're cheap.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.245
No, they're not.

37:04.188 --> 37:07.385
I didn't say they weren't expensive.
I sad they're cheap.

37:08.426 --> 37:12.795
Most folks that wear cheap clothes
on the outside are dead on the inside.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.728
The folks I work for,
they buy clothes that last.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.766
That's what I try to get you.

37:16.867 --> 37:20.963
Take Professor Burket. I wash his clothes
every week, and they always...

37:22.039 --> 37:23.404
Bennie, don't you be slamming around here,

37:23.507 --> 37:26.476
and don't you walk away
when I'm talking to you!

37:41.325 --> 37:44.988
Hey, Carl, they should use Carson's shirt
in class as a chemistry lesson.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.188
-A chemistry lesson?
-Yeah,

37:46.297 --> 37:50.028
'cause it smelled so bad it killed all
the bugs that was breeding inside of it.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.028
They was breeding
because your mama wore it.

37:54.138 --> 37:56.265
I think you're confusing that
with your mama.

37:56.374 --> 37:58.535
Her clothes are so raggedy,
even the mummy turned them down.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.668
Your mama's so old,
she's the mummy's mama.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.008
Your mama's so old,
your daddy's a dinosaur.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.050
Your mama's so old,
her birth certificate says ''expired'' on it.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.272
-Man, where we going?
-Come on.

38:36.781 --> 38:37.805
You got the money?

38:39.984 --> 38:41.849
-I need clothes for school.
-You got clothes for school.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.817
Not good enough for Hunter High.

38:49.026 --> 38:50.220
Come on.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.158
Jerome.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.557
This is my man.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.034
Give him the money.

39:15.786 --> 39:16.753
Okay.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.331
-Morning.
-Morning.

40:10.708 --> 40:14.269
Why aren't you wearing the pants I got you?
Don't they ft?

40:14.378 --> 40:16.642
I don't know. I didn't try them on.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.578
-Why not?
-They're the wrong kind.

40:18.682 --> 40:21.082
What you mean, they're the wrong kind?
I pad good money for them pants.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.745
That's too bad.
You can take them back if you want.

40:24.555 --> 40:27.080
I can't take them back.
I bought them on special.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.715
Well, that's too bad,
but I'm not gonna wear them.

40:28.826 --> 40:32.227
I'm fixing this window myself, Bennie,
so I'd have money to get you them pants.

40:32.329 --> 40:33.591
That's your problem.

40:33.697 --> 40:35.494
Look, throw them away!
I'm not gonna wear them!

40:35.599 --> 40:37.226
You can't have
everything in life you want, Bennie.

40:37.334 --> 40:39.097
-I can! I will!
-Not as long as you keep going

40:39.203 --> 40:41.433
down this path.
Talking smart and acting stupid!

40:41.539 --> 40:43.302
-Well, if I didn't know any better...
-Shut up! Shut up!

40:43.407 --> 40:45.898
-All you do is preach at me! Shut up!
-Bennie!

40:46.610 --> 40:48.601
-What are you, crazy?
-Get off! Get off!

40:49.346 --> 40:51.871
I sad stop it! All right, all right!

40:57.688 --> 40:59.918
You can buy whatever you want.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.253
You pay the balls,
you pay the balls next month.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.896
I'll bring home every dime
I make in cash and hand it to you.

41:07.998 --> 41:11.957
-What you got left, you keep for yourself.
-Now you're talking.

41:39.063 --> 41:40.428
Hey, B.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.495
-What's this crap?
-It's not crap, all right.

41:44.602 --> 41:45.591
Shut up.

41:45.703 --> 41:49.002
-You like this? You call this music?
-It's better than what you like.

41:51.442 --> 41:55.606
Hey, man, quit proving how stupid you are.
You don't have to act so ignorant!

41:58.883 --> 42:01.750
-Go to hell, man.
-What'd you say to me?

42:01.852 --> 42:03.012
Get off me!

42:08.125 --> 42:10.457
Bennie, what did you do?

42:12.696 --> 42:13.856
Joe.

42:17.668 --> 42:19.727
Get a teacher or something.

42:45.729 --> 42:49.665
Lord. Lord, you have to
take this temper away from me.

42:49.767 --> 42:52.133
Please. Please. Just take it.

43:37.448 --> 43:41.111
The protesters are here in Central Park,
50,000 strong.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.951
And there has been a significant showing...

44:07.478 --> 44:12.177
It is, in my opinion, the most amazing organ
the human body holds.

44:12.282 --> 44:16.685
By stimulating one section of the brain
of an 85-year-old,

44:16.787 --> 44:23.090
you can bring back, verbatim, memories of
a newspaper article read 60 years before.

44:23.961 --> 44:25.519
Consider your own brains.

44:25.996 --> 44:29.693
They've absorbed and digested
enough information to bring you here,

44:29.800 --> 44:32.132
which is no small achievement.

44:32.236 --> 44:36.434
Your dreams are all possible
because of 3 pounds of gray matter.

44:37.007 --> 44:38.872
We can describe it physically,

44:38.976 --> 44:42.503
but that won't give a clue
as to how it does what it does.

44:42.613 --> 44:46.879
Which is why I've devoted my life,
as a surgeon, to probing its mysteries.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.110
How did you do that?

44:48.218 --> 44:51.551
A lot of time away from home,
my wife would tell you.

44:51.655 --> 44:55.147
But dedication and intelligence
are the easy part.

44:55.259 --> 44:59.423
You also need an incredible
hand-eye coordination, which is a gft.

45:05.335 --> 45:10.068
A brain surgeon? My goodness.
Well, I always sad you can do

45:10.174 --> 45:13.041
-anything anybody else can do, Bennie.
-Anything anybody else can do, Bennie.

45:13.143 --> 45:15.168
-Only you can do it better.
-Only you can do it better.

45:15.279 --> 45:17.042
Don't laugh at me, it's true.

45:17.147 --> 45:20.048
-Your grades are good?
-They're fine.

45:20.150 --> 45:23.176
Now, tell me, how's that girlfriend of yours?

45:35.232 --> 45:38.929
-My mother says hi.
-I can't wait to meet her.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.228
You think she's coming
for Parents Weekend?

45:42.339 --> 45:43.806
Not if I'm not here.

45:44.608 --> 45:46.235
What? What are you talking about?

45:46.343 --> 45:50.439
Candy, you're a triple major.
I'm having trouble with just one.

45:50.547 --> 45:53.038
-Trouble?
-Yale's too much for me.

45:53.150 --> 45:54.879
What am I doing here, anyway?

45:54.985 --> 45:57.317
You got a scholarship.
You were third in your class.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.481
Yeah, and everybody else here
graduated first.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.719
My grades are lousy, especially chemistry.

46:04.661 --> 46:07.960
If I don't pass this final exam,
I lose my scholarship,

46:08.065 --> 46:09.293
which means I can't be a doctor,

46:09.399 --> 46:11.924
-which is the only thing...
-Slow down.

46:12.035 --> 46:13.502
What are you good at?

46:14.805 --> 46:18.263
What are you good at? When it comes
to studying, what works best for you?

46:18.375 --> 46:19.933
I don't know.

46:20.043 --> 46:23.774
Reading. I'm good at reading.
If all I ever did was read, I'd be just fine.

46:23.881 --> 46:25.644
Instead, I got to sit through
all these boring lectures

46:25.749 --> 46:28.013
-8 hours a day...
-Well, skip the lectures.

46:28.118 --> 46:29.779
The professors don't care.

46:29.887 --> 46:33.880
-That'll only make things worse.
-They can't be any worse than they are now.

46:36.693 --> 46:39.628
Hey, what do I know? Maybe I'm just...

46:39.730 --> 46:43.791
No, no, no. No, you're right.

46:43.901 --> 46:46.199
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

46:54.411 --> 46:58.438
-Joseph Lister.
-Pioneered the compound microscope,

46:58.549 --> 47:03.179
and made surgeons wear clean gloves
and swab wounds with carbolic acid.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.385
Newton's 2nd law.

47:05.489 --> 47:08.617
An applied force on an object

47:08.725 --> 47:12.559
equals the time change of rate
of its momentum.

47:13.630 --> 47:16.929
-The formula for methane.
-No.

47:17.034 --> 47:18.001
-Propane.
-No.

48:24.401 --> 48:25.766
Finish them.

48:49.126 --> 48:51.219
You don't need the book.

48:51.328 --> 48:54.923
You got the book inside you.

49:25.729 --> 49:31.463
Well, congratulations, Mr. Carson.
You have arrived with seconds to spare.

49:31.568 --> 49:34.059
everyone, open your test booklets.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.271
And begin.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.824
Maybe we should ask. Right?

50:07.471 --> 50:08.768
See you guys later.

50:15.045 --> 50:17.206
-What? What? What?
-I got an A.

50:22.319 --> 50:25.015
Now, you know,
now that I'm gonna be a neurosurgeon,

50:25.122 --> 50:27.488
you shouldn't marry me
'cause I probably won't be home much.

50:27.591 --> 50:28.888
Is that a promise?

50:35.932 --> 50:40.665
Johns Hopkins accepts only 2 students
a year for neurosurgery residency.

50:41.705 --> 50:45.402
This year, we have 1 25 applicants.

50:45.509 --> 50:48.945
So, why we should take you?

50:49.046 --> 50:52.812
I have good grades
and excellent recommendations.

50:52.916 --> 50:54.645
As do all of our applicants.

50:54.751 --> 50:59.848
Johns Hopkins is my first choice.
It's my only choice.

51:00.490 --> 51:05.985
You have confidence.
Yes, that's good in a neurosurgeon.

51:06.530 --> 51:07.997
But tell me something,

51:09.266 --> 51:12.133
why did you decide
to become a brain doctor?

51:14.905 --> 51:16.270
The brain...

51:25.182 --> 51:26.376
It's a miracle.

51:28.051 --> 51:29.541
Do you believe in miracles?

51:31.221 --> 51:35.681
Not a lot of doctors do.
There's not a lot of faith among physicians.

51:35.792 --> 51:37.726
I mean, we study reports,

51:37.828 --> 51:41.059
we cut open bodes,
it's all very tangible, sold.

51:42.265 --> 51:46.998
But the fact is, there's still so many things
we just can't explain.

51:48.271 --> 51:52.605
I believe we're all capable of
performing miracles, up here.

51:54.811 --> 51:58.577
I believe we're all blessed
with astonishing gifts and skills.

51:59.249 --> 52:01.012
Look at Handel.

52:01.118 --> 52:04.849
I mean, how can he compose something
like the Messiah in only 4 weeks?

52:07.090 --> 52:08.523
This is the channel,

52:08.625 --> 52:13.255
the source, the inspiration
for unbelievable accomplishments.

52:15.298 --> 52:18.199
-You like classical music?
-I love it.

52:18.835 --> 52:20.097
I do, too.

52:21.271 --> 52:24.035
I think we'll get on quite well together.

52:34.317 --> 52:39.050
Nursing supervisor to second floor, please.
Nursing supervisor to second floor, please.

52:47.297 --> 52:48.730
Good morning.

52:54.538 --> 52:55.903
Good morning.

52:56.006 --> 52:59.271
You're late. Mr. Schwartz in 301
needs to be taken to surgery now.

53:00.110 --> 53:03.443
No, I'm not an orderly. I'm the new intern.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.784
Report to Dr. Farmington for rounds.

53:08.885 --> 53:11.979
Dr. Carl, please call 2-4-8-8.

53:14.157 --> 53:17.126
This young man has a disease
called von Hippel-Lindau.

53:17.227 --> 53:21.095
It's very rare and causes multiple tumors
throughout the brain.

53:21.198 --> 53:25.567
He has his second surgery tomorrow,
and it will most likely cripple him.

53:27.704 --> 53:29.535
Carson, draw some blood.

53:29.639 --> 53:33.598
Doctor, according to his charts,
he may be anemic.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.610
-I don't think...
-Well, I don't care what you think.

53:35.712 --> 53:37.270
You do as I say.

53:45.288 --> 53:46.812
Don't think you're special, Carson,

53:46.923 --> 53:50.051
simply 'cause there's no one like you
in this department.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.491
If you don't change your attitude,

53:51.595 --> 53:55.395
I'll get you kicked out of neurosurgery
faster than you can say, ''Yassuh.''

54:02.105 --> 54:04.073
-Are you fished?
-Yes.

54:04.774 --> 54:05.832
Fine.

54:19.456 --> 54:22.016
Hey, buddy. Let's get you going here.

54:43.913 --> 54:45.244
How was it?

54:48.718 --> 54:49.878
Bennie?

54:54.224 --> 54:55.452
Ben?

55:09.939 --> 55:11.372
Good morning.

55:19.649 --> 55:21.640
Good morning, Nurse Smith.

55:34.431 --> 55:37.025
He was ht with a baseball bat.
He's deteriorating rapidly.

55:37.133 --> 55:40.534
Please tell him that all the neurosurgeons
at Hopkins are away at a conference.

55:40.637 --> 55:45.802
I am a resident. It is illegal for me to operate
without an attending physician present.

55:46.543 --> 55:50.741
I can't reach Dr. Farmington,
and I can't reach Dr. Udvarhelyi.

55:50.847 --> 55:54.374
If someone doesn't operate
on this man soon, he will de.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.149
Go for it.

55:59.022 --> 56:01.513
I'm not qualified to do a lobectomy.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.961
Thy will be done, Lord. Amen.

56:19.409 --> 56:20.603
Scalpel.

56:28.151 --> 56:29.448
Foley.

56:38.828 --> 56:40.022
Bipolar.

56:44.200 --> 56:45.827
Cottonoids, please.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.182
Radiology, please call to page.

57:08.291 --> 57:11.522
Dr. Udvarhelyi wants to see you
in his office ASAP.

57:19.702 --> 57:25.698
You operated on this man
without permission, without supervision.

57:25.809 --> 57:29.336
You put this hospital
in serious legal jeopardy.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.711
Had this man died,
your career would have been over.

57:38.054 --> 57:40.147
You did very well, Dr. Carson.

57:40.256 --> 57:42.724
I congratulate you
on taking the proper action,

57:42.826 --> 57:45.420
in spite of its possible consequences.

57:54.671 --> 57:56.730
Okay, come on, move, move. She's seizing.

57:57.740 --> 57:59.537
-I want you to see it, too.
-Okay.

58:00.543 --> 58:01.908
Okay, okay.

58:02.011 --> 58:03.808
They'll give you something
to make you better.

58:03.913 --> 58:05.778
-I don't have...
-Okay, all right.

58:05.882 --> 58:08.009
-It's getting worse, Doctor.
-Just relax, relax.

58:08.117 --> 58:10.244
Ben, have a look at this.

58:10.353 --> 58:13.049
The patent's a 4-year-old
by the name of Cynthia Gonzalez.

58:13.823 --> 58:15.814
She's been having seizures
since she was 18 months.

58:15.925 --> 58:17.654
She now has about 100 a day.

58:18.328 --> 58:21.320
They only affect her right side,
but they're so frequent,

58:21.431 --> 58:24.889
she's forgetting how to walk, talk, eat, learn.

58:26.736 --> 58:29.671
She's been diagnosed with Rasmussen's.

58:29.772 --> 58:32.400
Her parents have been told
there's nothing to be done.

58:43.453 --> 58:45.478
It's the only time she's seizure-free.

58:46.689 --> 58:49.385
When she's awake,
she lives between convulsions.

58:50.527 --> 58:54.463
She's been on 35 different medications
over the years.

58:55.932 --> 58:58.730
Sometimes they're so strong,
she doesn't recognize me.

59:00.570 --> 59:01.969
She's beautiful.

59:03.406 --> 59:07.240
One doctor called her
a mentality-retarded epileptic.

59:07.343 --> 59:09.834
Well, I'm here to tell you that she's not.

59:09.946 --> 59:11.709
Do you really think you can help?

59:13.349 --> 59:14.646
I can try.

59:23.326 --> 59:26.921
The left side of Cynthia's brain
is like a troubled kid on a playground

59:27.030 --> 59:29.055
beating up on her own twin.

59:29.165 --> 59:32.157
Now, you control that kid,
and the playground's at peace.

59:33.002 --> 59:34.026
How do we do that?

59:34.137 --> 59:36.605
There's an operation
called a hemispherectomy.

59:36.706 --> 59:40.073
It involves removing
the seizure-prone part of the brain.

59:40.176 --> 59:43.145
-What?
-How will she be able to live or survive

59:43.246 --> 59:45.737
-with half a brain?
-It's not as bad as it sounds.

59:46.716 --> 59:51.983
We don't know why, but a child's brain
has a remarkable ability to recover.

59:52.088 --> 59:55.922
It's as if the brain cells haven't decided
what they want to be when they grow up.

59:56.025 --> 59:59.153
They take on the functions
of the diseased cells

59:59.262 --> 01:00:02.060
and then eventually
restore the neurological function.

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:06.534
-You think there's a chance this will work?
-Yes. I do.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:11.063
But it is a gamble.
There's no way around that.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:16.275
If Cynthia survives,
she could be paralyzed on her right side.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.278
The left side of the brain
controls the speech area.

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.783
She may lose her ability to speak.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.353
Have you done
one of these operations yourself?

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.218
No. I have not.

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.106
How you feeling?

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.882
Wishing it were 4 months from now.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:58.010
Why? So we can get less sleep
than we do now?

01:00:58.121 --> 01:00:59.418
Good night.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.181
Your mother called today.

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:08.463
She sad the movers are coming in a week.
She's so excited.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:10.625
Me, too.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.963
So, are you ready?

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.266
For my mother or 2 more babes?

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.372
For tomorrow.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.248
Scalpel.

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.330
We are now exposing the skull.

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:45.391
Put more pressure on the edge, please.

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.129
Drill.

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:04.514
Please change to a footplate.

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.412
Saw.

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.071
Penfield 3.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:33.646
Removing the skull to access the dura.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.087
Holding skull flap for reconstruction.

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:51.529
We need to reduce the swelling.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.936
Inserting to relieve fluid pressure.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:32.335
I've removed the entire
left hemisphere of the brain.

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.123
Cynthia, can you hear me?

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.588
Can you open your eyes, sweetheart?
We're all done.

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:54.254
Let's see those pretty eyes, sweetheart.
Come on.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:04:00.399
It's time to wake up, Cynthia.
Let's see those pretty eyes, sweetheart.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.203
Can you open your eyes?

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:05.973
Let's see those pretty eyes.
We're all done now.

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:12.274
I don't know why she's not waking up, Ben.

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:25.958
How is she?

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:29.222
It took twice as long as we thought.

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:33.564
She lost 9 pints of blood,
which is double her normal volume.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.797
But she came through just fine.

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:41.032
Though it might be a while before we know
if she can move or speak.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.737
Mommy?

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:46.506
-Daddy?
-Oh, my God.

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.888
I love you.

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.361
Thank you.

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:09.262
Baby.

01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:12.603
She talks, she hears,
she thinks, she responds.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.335
There are no additional signs of weakness.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:16.502
-Dr. Carson...
-Dr. Carson, how is this possible?

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:18.273
The brain's a miraculous organ.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.174
How long have you been practicing?

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:25.311
I completed my residency 3 years ago,
but I haven't yet taken my oral exams.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.912
Are there any more seizures, Doctor?

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.424
So far, the seizures have subsided.

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:35.891
Grandma!

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.392
-Grandma!
-Grandma! Grandma!

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:43.332
Baby.

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:47.098
-Your daddy...
-Hey.

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.206
You're gonna love it here.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.984
Ben.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:10.364
Ben. Honey, wake up. Wake up.

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.262
I gotta go to the hospital.

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.797
I gotta go to the hospital.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.034
Oh, no.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:25.476
Get ready to crossmatch
with 2 units of blood.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.242
-Yes, Doctor.
-Ben...

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:30.174
It's best you wait out here, Dr. Carson.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.652
How do you feel?
Do you feel any contractions?

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.050
Okay, ma'am,
this might feel tight around your arm

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.421
when we take your blood pressure.

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.186
Okay, hook up the fetal monitor.

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:44.832
Oxygen to help you breathe.
Here you go, Mrs. Carson.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.194
Breathing okay?

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:51.131
Just take it slow. You're doing fine.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:13.518
Your wife will be fine, Dr. Carson.
She'll be just fine.

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:19.295
But I'm sorry to say we lost the babes.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.140
I'm so sorry.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.120
There was nothing I could do.

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:31.832
There was nothing I could do.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:43.749
What time is it?

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:46.218
11:30.

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:52.149
-Shouldn't you be on duty?
-I am.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.091
I mean neurosurgery.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.733
-Your patents need you.
-You need me.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.604
I have you. Go to work.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.911
-Down this hall.
-Okay. Thank you.

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:17.747
Doctor, where have you been?
You're late. What happened?

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:21.550
-I've been calling your house all morning.
-I'll make up for it.

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:51.814
That's...

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.821
Good girl. Hey.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:58.593
She's a good girl. Yes, you are.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.133
She's a big girl.

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:15.602
Okay. I love both of those hands.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.773
That's very good. Very nice.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.289
How are you feeling?

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.336
How are you feeling now?

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.039
Help me, Lord.

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:39.782
Ben, I've just been told you want
to hold off the operation on the twins.

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.685
The sooner we operate,
the better the chances for recovery.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:46.318
I know, I know, but they'll bleed out.
I can't figure out a way around that.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:49.329
Look, you're the best pediatric neurosurgeon
in the world.

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:52.491
-You may think I'm the best.
-That's why they chose you.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:55.001
If you can't find a solution, no one can.

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:26.460
Just like old times, huh?

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:29.903
You and me in the kitchen,
doing dishes after dinner.

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:33.304
except in Detroit,
we didn't have a dishwasher.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.901
Yes, we did. You're looking at her.

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:42.112
So proud of my boys.

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:46.278
Curtis, an engineer, you, a doctor.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:55.855
You're still thinking
about them Siamese twins, aren't you?

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.700
Sometimes I feel like...

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.462
I don't know, Mother.

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.869
Like a faucet that's all dried up.

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:16.981
I felt that way plenty of times.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:20.547
The thing is,
you got to find out what's blocking it

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.886
and move that thing out the way.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.788
I don't know what's blocking it.

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.259
Sure you do.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:35.634
You may not be able to bring back
your babes by saving these,

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:42.006
but, even if you fail,
at least you did something.

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.208
Bennie.

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:55.051
You can do this. Sure you can.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:02.730
You got all the world in here.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.298
You just gotta see beyond
what you can see.

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:12.270
Yes. Come on.

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.144
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:16.031
-Hello?
-Mark, we're a go.

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:21.233
First off, we'll need to have the room wired
with emergency power,

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:24.574
in case there's an electrical failure.
Then we'll need 2 of everything,

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.649
2 anesthesia monitors,
2 heart lung machines,

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:31.241
enough people on each team
to cover both babies.

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:35.312
We'll need an anesthesiology team,
a team of cardiac surgeons,

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:38.860
a team of plastic surgeons,
a team of neurosurgeons.

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:43.091
And we'll need to figure out how to fit
all 50 of us into one operating room.

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:46.463
Each team must rehearse
their respective procedures step-by-step,

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:49.002
and each team must develop scenarios

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:51.231
for the worst possible things
that could happen.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.071
If one baby des,
we need to separate him as fast as possible

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.873
and give all shared tissue
to the surviving twin.

01:16:58.246 --> 01:17:01.841
Cardiothoracic will start their procedures
at 6.:00 a.m.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:14.558
Hello, again, Peter, Augusta.
Welcome to Johns Hopkins.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.865
Your sons' blood vessels
are like tiny faucets

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.265
with only so much blood to lose.

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:26.206
Now, if we can turn off the faucets,
we can keep your sons from bleeding.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:30.274
The only way to do this
is to stop their hearts.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:33.246
-Stop their...
-It's not a new procedure.

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:36.181
It's been used by cardiovascular surgeons
for years.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:39.481
It's just never been applied
in a situation like this.

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:43.820
Now, we can do it in infants for an hour
without causing brain damage.

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:47.292
-But that hour is critical.
-Why? What happens in that hour?

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:49.193
We'll stop their hearts,

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:52.266
then spend that hour
reconstructing all the blood vessels

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:54.927
so that when their hearts start again,

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:57.471
there won't be
any life-threatening loss of blood.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.231
All in one hour?

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:03.639
Which is why
we've rehearsed and rehearsed,

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.507
and why we need to pray.

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:10.016
-You pray, Doctor?
-very day.

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:31.367
I'm removing the pericardium
to be used later as vascular tissue.

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.922
Cardo is done. All yours, Ben.

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.860
My light, please.

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.275
Scalpel.

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:40.700
I've opened the dura and revealed
the venous sinus that they share.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:45.610
I'm going to start separation now,
starting below the torcula.

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.579
There's a lot of bleeding.

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.957
Close it up. We'll try a different area.

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.897
Vital signs are stable.

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:16.703
Lord, it's like a lake of blood, it's huge.

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:20.941
Stitch.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.547
We have to start hypothermic arrest.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:32.650
Ben, we can't stop the hearts right now.
We haven't fished separating all the veins.

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.820
If we do it now,
it'll cut too deeply into our hour.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:37.330
If we don't stop the hearts, they'll bleed out.

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:40.730
-Start cooling the blood.
-Cooling.

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:47.003
Prepare to inject the saline coolant solution
to replace the blood.

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.077
Aortic cross-clamp.

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.719
Cardiologic needle.

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:09.061
Blood cooling to 20 degrees.

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:14.633
The hearts are stopped.
Turn off the heart-lung machine.

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:17.364
Okay. We have one hour to finish separation,

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:20.339
rebuild the severed veins
and reconstruct the torcula.

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:22.603
Pick up.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.075
Bipolar. More suction, please.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.785
Dr. Wong, call the page operator.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:42.793
I'm now separating the sagittal sinus.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.563
Okay. Prepare for separation.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:50.771
Right.

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:55.937
Set.

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.741
I'm ready to go.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.609
All right, on my mark.

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:06.344
3, 2, 1, separate.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.122
-Slowly.
-easy.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.059
Get ready with the drapes.
Make sure we don't contaminate the field.

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:20.260
Get that drape, too.

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.461
-Go ahead, hang it.
-Adjust that light, please.

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:23.537
I got the drapes.

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:29.637
You adjust the drape?

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:35.180
-Anesthesia? How does it look?
-Give us a few minutes, Ben.

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.652
Start the restructuring of the torcula.

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:58.095
This is taking 3 times as long
as I thought.

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.275
It's just too darn small.

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:04.436
Pressure's coming down, Ben.

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.289
Done with vascular reconstruction.

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.654
-Turn on the pump.
-Yes, Doctor.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.025
-Start re-warming the blood.
-Yes, Doctor. Warming the blood.

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:31.028
I don't think I can do it in time.

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:36.402
1 minute, 30 seconds, Doctor.

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:56.286
You don't need the book.

01:23:56.798 --> 01:24:00.063
You got the book inside you.

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:14.372
Done.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.718
Start the pumps. Warm the blood.

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:20.784
Starting the pumps.

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.561
Get ready to start the heart, baby one.

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:33.029
Paddles in, baby 2.

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.630
Clear, baby 1.

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.535
Okay. Do it.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:44.301
Baby 2. Charge to 10.

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.948
Clear. All right, do it.

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:59.717
Looks like sinus rhythm.

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:13.206
-Start closing up the chest.
-Closing.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:18.109
Begin closing the dura, Dr. Long.

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:20.939
Closing, Ben.

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.643
Stitch, please.

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:27.615
Stitch, please.

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.221
Someone let the parents know
we're almost finished.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.692
Yes, Doctor.

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:40.160
-Close them up. Dr. Long?
-One more stitch, Ben.

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:41.929
Disconnect my light, please.

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:45.166
Light, please.

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:51.037
Neuro's clear.
Plastic surgeons, prepare to begin.

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.810
Thank you, Ben. Plastics, stepping in.

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.681
Ultrasound tech to Labor 4, please.

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:29.909
Peter.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:35.382
Doctor?

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:39.583
Which child would you like to see first?

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:44.364
Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:46.730
Thank you.

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:01.781
-Good.
-Yeah.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.009
I'm okay.

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:04.919
-Okay.
-Yeah?

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:05.986
Okay.

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.682
-All right.
-Congratulations.

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:10.550
Fantastic. Nice work.

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.129
Good job.

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:19.358
Ben, congratulations. Incredible job.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.800

Nice work, Dr. Carson.

as soon as he steps up to the podium.

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:41.507
I always sad,
you can do anything anyone else can do,

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:44.278
-only you can do it better.
-Only you can do it better.

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.410
That goes for you, too, Mother.
