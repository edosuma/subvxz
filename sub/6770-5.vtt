WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:07.006
(phone ringing)

00:08.508 --> 00:10.543
Yeah? Hello?

00:10.610 --> 00:12.579
BOY:
This is Radio 109.7,

00:12.645 --> 00:14.314
and if you can tell us
what song we're playing,

00:14.381 --> 00:17.183
you could win $10,000.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.486
This is Special Agent
Kincaid with the FBI.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.020
This call is being traced.

00:21.087 --> 00:23.323
-Shh! -Federal agents are
on their way.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.158
We're in trouble.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.159
Hang up.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.695
(whispering): Oh, man.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.530
You gotta love these
phony phone calls.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.365
Oh, it's the tenth time
this week

00:32.432 --> 00:34.300
those juvenile delinquents
have called.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.136
-(Dylan grunts)
-Ow, ow!

00:36.202 --> 00:39.072
Well, since I'm up...

00:39.139 --> 00:42.375
What, are you gonna work?

00:42.442 --> 00:44.377
Yeah.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.613
I've always liked
writing at night.

00:46.679 --> 00:49.282
Well, since I'm up...

00:49.349 --> 00:51.351
(Dylan sighs)

00:53.353 --> 00:55.355
TV ANNOUNCER: In a few moments
we'll return to our...

00:55.422 --> 00:57.290
Uh, the reason I like writing
at night

00:57.357 --> 00:59.292
-(gasps)
-is because it's usually quiet.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.361
<i>Gone With the Wind.</i>

01:01.428 --> 01:02.662
It's my favorite.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.330
When I was a little girl
I dressed up like Scarlett

01:04.397 --> 01:06.199
-for Halloween. It was great.
-Mm-hmm.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.767
Well, I tell you what.
Why don't we--

01:07.834 --> 01:11.671
we'll catch the second half
of this down in your room.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.506
What, are you sending me
to my room?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.208
No, it's just I--

01:15.275 --> 01:18.845
you know, I want to write
and it's... late.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.847
WOMAN (on TV):
Look for the bright red...

01:20.914 --> 01:23.683
We had time for sex.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.118
Well, yeah.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.319
No, it's okay.

01:26.386 --> 01:29.389
Next time you want to pencil
me in, you just let me know.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.293
(sighs)

01:35.328 --> 01:36.863
Hey, you got a second?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.665
Ice machine's down the hall.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.433
I know, I live here.
And I've seen you

01:40.500 --> 01:41.634
coming out of here at all hours.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.669
-Good for you.
-Listen, if you want

01:42.735 --> 01:43.736
a late-night shift, I got a gig.

01:43.803 --> 01:47.407
Lot of girls who work the hotel
dance at my club.

01:47.474 --> 01:48.708
-What?
-Strictly high rollers.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.743
-Now, why don't you do a little
tryout for me...? -Why don't you

01:50.810 --> 01:53.279
-take your hand off my arm?
-You are making a big mistake.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.181
Hey, I-I-I don't mean
to step on your dime.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.417
If she's still servicing you,
I can...

01:57.484 --> 01:59.152
-(groans)
-Yeah.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.787
-Now apologize to the lady.
-Why? He made me feel

02:00.854 --> 02:03.223
the same way you do.

02:06.593 --> 02:08.595
(elevator bell dings)

02:15.702 --> 02:17.704
(elegant piano music plays)

02:19.906 --> 02:21.608
My parents kicked me
out of the house

02:21.674 --> 02:23.309
when they found out
we were dating.

02:23.376 --> 02:24.310
This is different.

02:24.377 --> 02:25.945
Yeah, it's so much worse.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.651
Mom, Dad.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.720
-You know Steve.
-Hi.

02:33.786 --> 02:35.822
You're pregnant?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.891
Yes, I am.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.759
All right, come on, Michelle.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.494
STEVE:
Please, don't go.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.796
We have an announcement to make.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.466
A, uh, second announcement.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.502
It's one that we hope
you'll be happy about.

02:49.569 --> 02:50.570
Because we are.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.306
We're getting married.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.174
WOMAN: No problem.
I'll bring it to your table.

02:55.241 --> 02:58.645
Well, this is all so unexpected.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.713
Janet, you're too young
to marry.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.382
You haven't dated enough...

03:02.448 --> 03:03.583
Men who are Japanese?

03:04.617 --> 03:06.886
(sighs) There are so many things
you wanted to do.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.888
Like marry the man I love.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.925
Which is exactly what I'm gonna
do, whether you like it or not.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.928
You're disgracing our family.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.733

My point is there is...

there's the guy you hear
on the radio, right?

05:15.882 --> 05:17.817
-There's him and then
there's me. -Mm-hmm.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.719
Oh, the guy that I kissed.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.521
-Exactly.
-Which is funny,

05:21.587 --> 05:23.790
because, you know, you sound
exactly like the guy that

05:23.856 --> 05:25.425
-reviewed that kiss to thousands
of listeners. -Wait, yeah,

05:25.491 --> 05:26.659
but that was the other guy.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.894
(laughing): Oh,
I keep forgetting.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.662
-You're Mr. Average.
-Average?

05:29.729 --> 05:30.930
-Mmm.
-Ow. You know, I-I--

05:30.997 --> 05:32.098
things were going so good,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.466
I was kinda hoping
I'd rate a notch higher,

05:33.533 --> 05:35.368
-but I guess...
-You do. You do.

05:35.435 --> 05:36.703
-Look, I know you hate my show.
-It's...

05:36.769 --> 05:37.704
Okay?

05:37.770 --> 05:39.405
Sometimes I hate my show.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.773
(both laugh)

05:40.840 --> 05:42.108
Here's my suggestion to you.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.509
All right? Listen to me.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.711
The next time you hear
that guy...

05:44.777 --> 05:46.079
-The jerk?
-The jerk.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.013
Uh-huh.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.015
Just.. turn it off.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.451
Just reach out
and turn the radio off.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.453
-I can do that.
-Okay.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.921
The question is,
can you do that?

05:54.987 --> 05:56.522
Absolutely.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.758
(laughing): What?

05:58.825 --> 06:00.827
You didn't buy it? Absolutely.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.895
That one sound better?

06:04.430 --> 06:05.832
(rock music plays)

06:05.898 --> 06:07.700
Hey, look who's here!

06:07.767 --> 06:09.669
(cheering, applause)

06:11.637 --> 06:14.707
A rep from KVIB dropped off

06:14.774 --> 06:16.609
a box of these.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.077
"If you're gonna play,
you might as well score."

06:18.144 --> 06:20.947
Wait, R-- that's the other guy.
All right? That's the jerk.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.115
It's not me.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.784
You know, I wish
I believed that.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.424
MATT:
<i>So, wait a minute.</i>

06:31.491 --> 06:32.859
When her parents found out
she was pregnant,

06:32.925 --> 06:34.861
-they didn't even sit down?
-Mm-mmm.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.629
We're expecting a baby
in three months,

06:36.696 --> 06:38.131
and we're trying
to plan a wedding

06:38.197 --> 06:39.699
-that includes both
our families. -Mmm.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.768
And you got lunch
with your old man today.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.603
Oh, yeah, the fun never ends,
does it?

06:43.669 --> 06:44.704
How's Janet holding up?

06:44.771 --> 06:46.672
She dragged me out to the
hardware store last night,

06:46.739 --> 06:47.840
just to find
some color swatches...

06:47.907 --> 06:48.908
then stays up all night

06:48.975 --> 06:51.577
obsessing over what color
to paint the nursery.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.446
Did you guys, uh, find a place?

06:53.513 --> 06:55.782
Add that to the never-ending
list of things to do.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.751
What about here?

06:58.818 --> 07:00.820
Well, it'd be great,
but it's not big enough.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.655
With the nursery,
we're one bedroom short.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.457
Not if one of us moved out.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.793
I couldn't ask you to do that.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.060
Steve, you got enough
to deal with

07:08.127 --> 07:09.529
without worrying about
where you're gonna live.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.863
You'd do that?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.899
Well, not for you,
but for Janet and the kid?

07:12.965 --> 07:14.634
-Yeah, we'd do that.
-Hmm.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.636
Oh, that is a huge relief!

07:16.702 --> 07:18.604
Oh! Thanks, guys.

07:18.671 --> 07:19.806
Seriously.

07:19.872 --> 07:20.807
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

07:20.873 --> 07:21.941
Hey, don't worry about it.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.609
Have a great day.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.877
Yeah. (chuckles)

07:24.944 --> 07:26.445
NOAH:
Okay.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.680
I don't know about you,

07:27.747 --> 07:29.549
but "no problem"
isn't exactly accurate.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.650
No, it's not even close, man.

07:30.716 --> 07:31.884
I'm broke.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.822
This is bound to bring up the
whole living-together issue.

07:35.888 --> 07:36.756
Not for me.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.825
Donna doesn't want to,
and you know what?

07:38.891 --> 07:40.860
I am standing alone
on this one, buddy.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.771
-Hello.
-Hey.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.639
Mmm.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.208
Is this for a new display?

07:55.274 --> 07:57.210
Uh, no. These are decorations

07:57.276 --> 07:59.245
for Steve and Janet's
engagement party.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.814
Hmm, well, I think you can
scratch Janet's parents

08:01.881 --> 08:03.549
off the guest list.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.017
She was so freaked out
after seeing them,

08:05.084 --> 08:07.053
she stayed up all night picking
out colors for the nursery.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.888
Nursery? What nursery?

08:08.955 --> 08:12.992
Um... the one going
in Noah's room.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.694
Or mine.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.928
Somebody's moving out?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.163
Maybe me.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.764
I don't know.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.766
But it raises some issues.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.768
Or, you know, opportunities.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.003
For us.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.539
CUSTOMER:
Excuse me.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.674
-Do you have any handbags?
-Oh.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.176
Yeah, right over there.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.644
Oh, there.

08:31.711 --> 08:32.879
Well, you get back to work,

08:32.945 --> 08:34.679
and we can talk about this
later, okay?

08:34.746 --> 08:36.716
-Okay.
-All right.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.688
Did I hear Matt's voice?

08:42.755 --> 08:44.557
Yeah.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.093
We were just talking about
moving in together, I think.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.694
-What?
-Well,

08:48.761 --> 08:49.862
apparently, Steve and Janet

08:49.929 --> 08:51.163
are gonna be staying
in the Walsh house.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.565
What about Matt and Noah?

08:52.632 --> 08:53.599
Somebody's gotta go.

08:53.666 --> 08:54.767
Noah didn't mention it to you?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.235
No.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.104
Well, I'm sure he will.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.710
Where's Dylan?

09:04.777 --> 09:05.711
I don't know.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.813
Look, I've got this month's rent
check for him.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.814
Fine, I'll take it.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.016
No, no, no, no, no.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.751
-(Gina mutters)
-(chuckles)

09:11.817 --> 09:12.885
I want to give it to him myself.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.688
I want to explain why it's
a little short this month.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.823
Oh, you didn't sell
enough Jell-O shots?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.659
(laughs)

09:19.725 --> 09:21.093
That's the lease agreement.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.629
I do all the work, he reaps
all the benefits, you know.

09:23.696 --> 09:24.830
Well, of course he does.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.698
If it makes you feel any better,

09:25.765 --> 09:28.467
that's his approach
to romance, too.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.740
That guy gives me an idea.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.777
What if I told you...

09:37.843 --> 09:39.612
that we could double your money,

09:39.679 --> 09:41.681
and you wouldn't have to share
a penny with Dylan?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.149
-We?
-Yeah, me and you.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.684
-(chuckles)
-(giggles)

09:44.750 --> 09:45.718
That's already a bad idea.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.720
All right, well, whatever.
I was just thinking,

09:47.787 --> 09:48.854
you know, a little side venture.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.089
I'd plan it, you'd run it.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.091
Just a little after-hours
business.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.759
But it's cool.

09:53.826 --> 09:54.760
After hours, huh?

09:54.827 --> 09:56.095
Mm-hmm.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.597
Strippers, lap dancing.

09:58.664 --> 10:02.768
Rich guys plus sleazy girls
equals...

10:02.835 --> 10:04.270
money.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.238
Yeah, and trouble.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.740
(laughs)

10:07.807 --> 10:09.709
Yeah.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.680
Tell me your decision
to get married

10:14.747 --> 10:16.148
has nothing to do
with the pregnancy.

10:16.215 --> 10:17.116
Nothing.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.919
Shotgun weddings
don't work, son.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.855
Dad, no one's forcing
this marriage.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.658
Have some sparkling water
and chopsticks, please?

10:25.725 --> 10:27.827
They love it
when you use chopsticks.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.197
Dad, I could use your support.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.898
You got it, son.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.834
Married or not, you got that.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.737
Look, why don't you order
for us, huh?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.405
Uh, maybe a nice, uh,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.307
spicy meat dish or something.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.975
They always keep the
best dishes a secret

10:43.042 --> 10:45.711
for the, uh... (chuckles)
Chinese, not-not your people.

10:46.979 --> 10:47.913
STEVE:
I know.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.281
He needs therapy.

10:49.348 --> 10:50.316
WAITER: Sir, I'm not sure
what you'd like,

10:50.383 --> 10:53.019
because I'm both Vietnamese
and a vegetarian.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.854
So, I haven't tried
the meat dishes.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.157
Could you give us
a minute, please?

10:58.224 --> 11:01.327
Okay, here's what I think.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.696
You have the child first.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.831
And then you see
how it goes between you.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.434
JANET:
See how it goes?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.802
So you're saying
don't get married?

11:09.869 --> 11:11.804
STEVE:
Just so you know,

11:11.871 --> 11:13.806
Janet and I love each other
very much.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.308
We're not gonna
take your advice.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.311
Let's go.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.290
-Whoa.
-Oh, great.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.324
You smell good.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.926
Uh, don't, Dylan.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.796
I just came to pick up my bag,
and here's your key.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.065
I was gonna order some dinner.
Why don't you stay?

11:39.131 --> 11:40.933
-I'm off the clock.
-Oh.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.468
Gina, the living situation--

11:42.535 --> 11:43.936
it has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.037
No, Dylan, don't even tell...
You know what?

11:45.104 --> 11:45.971
-You make me feel like a whore.
-You know I want...

11:46.038 --> 11:47.073
-Do you know that?
-I want to be with you.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.040
-I don't want to live with you.
-Oh. I don't even want

11:48.107 --> 11:50.109
to hear it.
It's always about you, isn't it?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.445
{\an8}Mr. McKay, I'm Maria Alvarez.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.879
I'm a housekeeper here
at the hotel.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.314
Yeah.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.916
And my sons have something
they'd like to say to you.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.084
BOY:
Uh, sorry

11:58.150 --> 12:00.152
-about the phony phone calls.
-Me, too.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.054
MARIA:
It's my fault. Ever since

12:02.121 --> 12:03.789
the community center stopped
their programs,

12:03.856 --> 12:05.891
I've had to bring them
to work with me.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.426
I take it Hector caught you.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.895
Yeah.

12:09.962 --> 12:13.132
Yeah, Hector used
to bust me, too, all the time.

12:13.199 --> 12:14.467
May I have a word
with the boys?

12:14.533 --> 12:15.835
Okay.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.405
All right, you two knuckleheads,
listen to me.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.875
You see this joker over here,
room 701?

12:22.942 --> 12:25.911
This guy needs a wakeup call
every, uh...

12:25.978 --> 12:28.514
every 15 minutes
starting at 6:00 in the morning.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.316
You guys think
you can handle it?

12:30.382 --> 12:31.317
No problem.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.318
DYLAN:
Remember,

12:32.384 --> 12:33.786
I owe you one,

12:33.853 --> 12:36.889
and I am the best,
so when you least expect it,

12:36.956 --> 12:38.757
expect it.

12:38.824 --> 12:39.892
All right?

12:39.959 --> 12:40.860
Get out of here.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.095
Get a haircut.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.935
Why hasn't Noah told me
he might be moving out?

12:50.002 --> 12:51.937
Noah's moving out?

12:52.004 --> 12:53.439
I don't know.
He hasn't mentioned it.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.840
That's weird, right?

12:57.443 --> 12:58.944
I'm sure there's an explanation.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.948
Okay, um, let's get back
to party planning.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.783
We'll just forget about Noah.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.852
Let's forget about Janet's
parents' hostility, too, okay?

13:06.919 --> 13:09.788
Let's forget about Steve's
father's insensitivity.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.056
I think it's about
the hostility, don't you?

13:11.123 --> 13:14.960
A hula skirt, anyone? Anyone?

13:15.027 --> 13:16.929
Well, at-at least
your mom's happy about the news.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.898
You know what? Thank God
she's out of town filming

13:18.964 --> 13:20.166
in Toronto.
You know why?

13:20.232 --> 13:21.901
See, she's a Caucasian,
and she's a lesbian,

13:21.967 --> 13:23.903
which means she's a double
threat to your parents.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.571
Have the baby,
see how it goes?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.206
Did your father say,
"Date other women,"

13:27.273 --> 13:28.574
or was that just the subtext?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.110
Oh, please, Janet!

13:31.177 --> 13:33.879
Well, we could call the florist
about the leis.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.147
(knocking at door)

13:40.553 --> 13:42.054
-Hey...
-Surprise!

13:42.121 --> 13:43.889
(laughing)

13:43.956 --> 13:44.990
Hi, Karen.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.859
Hey, congratulations.

13:46.926 --> 13:47.960
BOTH:
Oh.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.930
KAREN: Oh, gosh, your mom told
me about the party,

13:50.996 --> 13:52.097
and though she couldn't make it,

13:52.164 --> 13:55.234
I was in San Diego on business,
and she insisted I come.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.002
-Oh, good.
-Oh, you must be Janet.

13:57.069 --> 13:58.604
Yes, uh, Donna, Janet...

13:58.671 --> 13:59.905
-Hi.
-...this is Karen Lewis,

13:59.972 --> 14:02.107
my mom's girlfriend.
Uh, partner?

14:03.108 --> 14:04.610
Y-You're here
for the engagement party?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.279
I'm here to represent
the healthy, loving side

14:07.346 --> 14:10.115
of Steve's family in
your gorgeous mother's absence.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.984
I can't wait
to meet your parents.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.052
Huh.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.286
-(Janet groans)
-Janet?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.522
Hey, are you all right?
Is it the baby?

14:16.589 --> 14:18.157
Something's wrong.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.358
Call Dr. Long.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.094
Tell her to meet us
at the hospital.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.463
Oh, my God.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.137
GINA:
<i>All right, so after</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:34.273
-the club closes...
-We open for an after party.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.574
Right. 20 bucks a head.

14:35.641 --> 14:36.976
No. You know what?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.410
We can get 30. Trust me.

14:38.477 --> 14:39.445
Really?

14:39.511 --> 14:41.080
-Yes.
-Okay, but all

14:41.146 --> 14:42.448
the girls negotiate
their own deals and pocket

14:42.514 --> 14:43.449
their own money,

14:43.515 --> 14:45.084
and they can negotiate
whatever else they want.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.352
Okay, how do we fill the seats?

14:46.418 --> 14:48.954
Compliments
of Kelly's publicist.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.589
You know, it's so weird, because

14:50.656 --> 14:52.191
she lost her contact list
of power players,

14:52.258 --> 14:53.592
and suddenly, it ended up
in my purse.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.027
(laughs)

14:55.094 --> 14:57.196
-Finders keepers.
-Losers weepers.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.064
-(Gina laughs)
-That's right.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.367
So what's up with your sudden
change of heart, anyway?

15:01.433 --> 15:03.435
First and last month's rent.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.972
You moving out
of the Walsh house?

15:07.039 --> 15:08.307
Maybe, and you know,

15:08.374 --> 15:10.509
apartments are a lot more
expensive than I remember.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.911
What about moving in with Donna?

15:12.978 --> 15:14.980
She wouldn't want to,
and even if she did,

15:15.047 --> 15:16.148
I'm not gonna freeload off her.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.583
Yeah, well, considering
how bad it feels

15:17.650 --> 15:18.684
for me to freeload off of Dylan,

15:18.751 --> 15:21.320
I guess you're probably making
the right decision.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.921
Then why are you staying here,
living off his money?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.490
Because I'm broke,
just like you.

15:24.556 --> 15:25.758
All right,
now, I'm just curious here.

15:25.824 --> 15:28.027
I mean, what happened to all the
money Donna's mom forked over?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.095
My mother spent it all.

15:31.563 --> 15:32.698
(grunts)

15:32.765 --> 15:34.366
Doesn't matter.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.936
I'm gonna make it all back...
and then some.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.707
(laughing)

15:41.774 --> 15:43.342
I can't remember the last time

15:43.409 --> 15:44.610
anybody asked
to use our projector.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.947
Mm, yeah, well, video and DVD--
it's not quite the same thing.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.316
Oh, hold on a second.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.617
<i>Sientense aquí, por favor.</i>

15:51.684 --> 15:53.686
And finish your homework.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.422
And don't move.

15:56.488 --> 15:57.956
Do you hear me?

15:58.023 --> 15:58.924
(indistinct chatter)

16:02.795 --> 16:05.197
(boys yelling)

16:06.532 --> 16:08.267
(laughs)

16:08.334 --> 16:10.669
Oh, yeah,
when you least expect it,

16:10.736 --> 16:11.670
expect it.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.505
-You're good.
-Very good.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.307
Mm.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.242
MARIA:
Homework.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.011
Now!

16:22.548 --> 16:23.649
(laughing)

16:23.716 --> 16:26.618
DR. LONG: <i> I'm happy to say,</i>
<i>the ultrasound</i>

16:26.685 --> 16:27.753
images were normal,

16:27.820 --> 16:29.488
the baby's heart rate
was normal,

16:29.555 --> 16:30.756
and your blood work was normal.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.092
-So she's okay?
-As far as we can tell,

16:33.158 --> 16:35.160
mother and baby
are absolutely fine.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.328
Thank God.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.363
Then why did it feel like

16:37.429 --> 16:39.465
my heart was beating
a million miles a minute?

16:39.531 --> 16:40.666
DR. LONG:
Have you been under a lot

16:40.733 --> 16:41.567
of stress lately?

16:41.633 --> 16:42.735
(Steve chuckles)

16:42.801 --> 16:43.535
Some.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.304
DR. LONG:
From what you describe,

16:45.371 --> 16:46.505
you might have had
a panic attack.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.773
A panic attack?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.508
We were just
sitting around talking.

16:49.575 --> 16:50.776
I've never had one before.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.777
DR. LONG:
Good.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.711
Let's avoid another.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.380
I'm reluctant

16:54.446 --> 16:57.116
to prescribe any medication
this late in your pregnancy,

16:57.182 --> 16:59.785
so my advice is, light exercise,

16:59.852 --> 17:01.620
plenty of rest,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.188
and most of all,

17:03.255 --> 17:05.691
avoid stressful situations.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.025
Janet.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.060
Mom, what are you doing here?

17:09.127 --> 17:10.128
I called her.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.463
Are you all right?

17:11.530 --> 17:12.464
I'm okay.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.799
Oh, thank God.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.800
I was so terrified.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.202
That makes two of us.
I completely panicked.

17:17.269 --> 17:19.070
Oh, being pregnant
can be scary.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.039
I know. I was with you.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.509
There have been so many times
I've wanted to call you.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.711
Well, your health,

17:25.778 --> 17:27.780
this child--

17:27.846 --> 17:29.715
that's the most important thing
now.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.183
(Janet sighs)

17:32.785 --> 17:35.654
Remember, no stress.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.790
(indistinct voice
over P.A. system)

17:37.856 --> 17:39.625
I'm Michelle Sosna,
Janet's mother.

17:39.691 --> 17:42.795
I know Donna, but, uh...

17:42.861 --> 17:46.532
Uh, Mrs. Sosna,
this is Karen.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.634
-(whispers): Hi.
-My adopted sister.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.636
Come on, sis.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.137
Let's get some coffee.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.072
I'll explain.
I'll explain.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.213
Grand Central Market
was amazing.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.181
Yes.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.682
And Angels Flight--
oh, that was so cool.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.451
Shortest railway in the world.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.352
Thank you for taking me.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.289
Thank <i> you</i> for giving me
another chance.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.295
What did I tell you, huh?

18:16.361 --> 18:18.764
Me and the guy on the air
don't have to mix, right?

18:18.831 --> 18:21.800
You know, I would love
to invite you in right now,

18:21.867 --> 18:23.735
but I would feel really weird
about it.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.170
So don't.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.371
You don't have to.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.739
But then you won't call.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.741
I mean, it's your choice.
I'm just saying...

18:29.808 --> 18:32.110
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Come on, David.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.546
I listen to your show.
This was our third date.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.614
Either you're in or you're out.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.615
We sleep together tonight,

18:36.682 --> 18:38.150
or I'm history, right?
Isn't that your rule?

18:38.217 --> 18:39.651
Want to hang out tomorrow night?

18:39.718 --> 18:41.119
If you're offering me
an extension

18:41.186 --> 18:43.121
on that deadline,
I think I'm gonna pass.

18:43.188 --> 18:46.225
My friends Steve and Janet are
throwing an engagement party.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.292
It's a luau.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.760
(laughs)

18:48.827 --> 18:51.163
Ah... sounds irresistible,
doesn't it?

18:52.397 --> 18:54.299
I really want you
to meet my friends.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.569
I'll think about it.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.770
You do that.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.176
(smooching)

19:05.210 --> 19:07.579
Good night.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.453
Thanks.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.257
I saw this, uh, townhouse today,
driving back from work.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.793
And it had two bedrooms,
an office, upper and lower deck.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.196
Mm. Sounds big.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.766
Well, not for two people.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.468
Come on, let's give it a shot.

19:29.535 --> 19:30.502
I think it'd be fun.

19:30.569 --> 19:34.573
It-It would be fun someday.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.575
I like living with Donna, I like

19:36.642 --> 19:38.777
walking around with a mud mask,

19:38.844 --> 19:40.779
knowing there are nights
when I don't have to look cute.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.481
Oh, mud masks are cute.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.650
I like things the way they are.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.685
Things are good, right?

19:46.752 --> 19:49.755
Just thought they could be
better, that's all.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.690
I'm not saying they wouldn't be.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.659
No. You're just talking
about living with Donna

19:53.725 --> 19:54.893
and beauty treatments

19:54.960 --> 19:56.795
and pretty much
everything but us, right?

20:00.766 --> 20:02.668
I have to tell you something.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.770
Okay, I'm listening.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.338
I can't make the luau.

20:06.405 --> 20:07.639
Oh.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.741
Okay. Is that it?

20:09.808 --> 20:11.677
I got so much
work at the club.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.812
Restock the shelves,
do the books,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.381
and we are way over budget.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.250
Anything else?

20:18.317 --> 20:19.551
I'm crazy about you.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.687
Come on, Noah.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.822
I know
that you might be moving out.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.490
Matt told Kelly, and...

20:25.557 --> 20:26.858
-And Kelly told you?
-Yeah.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.327
Look, it's my problem.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.861
I'll deal with it.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.930
It's not our problem?

20:31.997 --> 20:33.765
I'm getting my own place.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.767
It's no big deal.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.875
GINA:
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

20:43.942 --> 20:45.344
What? Are you kidding me?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.712
This club is gonna make
every other club

20:46.778 --> 20:48.313
in Los Angeles look like
a church picnic.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.848
(laughs)

20:49.915 --> 20:51.717
Yes.

20:51.783 --> 20:53.819
Of course I'm gonna be there.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.988
Yeah. No, just bring
whoever you want.

20:56.054 --> 20:57.723
-(knocking)
-Okay. Yeah, hold...

20:57.789 --> 20:59.825
Yeah? Come in!

20:59.891 --> 21:01.360
Hey, I'll see you there.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.661
Okay, bye.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.529
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait. Excuse me.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.365
Uh, that's... This...
You have the wrong room.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.733
-(Dylan humming)
-This-This is... This isn't...

21:07.799 --> 21:09.635
That is... What...
What are you doing?

21:09.701 --> 21:10.702
-What?
-Well, here you go.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.903
That's for your enjoyment.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.505
Now, take a ticket.
Take-Take two.

21:13.572 --> 21:14.973
-What?
-So I can be your date.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.508
Thank you very much.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.676
Now give me that back.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.645
Enjoy the show, miss.

21:19.711 --> 21:20.612
Quickly, gentlemen.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.715
We have a beautiful young woman
to impress.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.784
Uh, it was <i> Gone With the Wind,</i>
was it not?

21:25.851 --> 21:27.686
-(Gina laughs)
<i>-Gone With the Wind.</i>

21:27.753 --> 21:29.721
Oh, yeah.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.758
And it is show time. Yeow!

21:32.824 --> 21:34.726
GINA:
You're insane.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.662
All right, let's just... Ow.

21:36.728 --> 21:37.596
-What are you...?
-What is that?

21:37.663 --> 21:39.431
-Oh, wait. I'll...
-Is that your date book?

21:39.498 --> 21:41.366
-Here, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Get that out of here.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.801
Okay.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.369
Yeah.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.405
Mmm.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.679
I hope Kelly and Donna
never come home.

21:53.745 --> 21:55.681
Mm-hmm.

21:55.747 --> 21:56.982
-How's that feel? Good?
-Good.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.750
-How about some
of that ice cream? -Okay.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.751
(doorbell rings)

21:59.818 --> 22:00.819
You'll get it!

22:00.886 --> 22:03.622
(Steve laughs)

22:03.689 --> 22:05.023
(Janet chuckles)

22:07.592 --> 22:10.462
Mr. and Mrs. Sosna!

22:10.529 --> 22:11.930
Come in, please.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.539
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.713
We've come because now <i> we</i> have
an announcement to make.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.347
I told him about your scare.

22:29.414 --> 22:31.850
Some events can be
a blessing in disguise.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.919
I shouldn't have
pushed you away.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.722
STEVE: You're right,
you shouldn't have.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.523
She's your daughter,
and she needs you.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.693
I couldn't agree
with you more.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.463
Which is why we want you
to move back in with us.

22:45.664 --> 22:46.732
Is that your announcement?

22:46.798 --> 22:48.633
We want to help:
with the child,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.602
with expenses,
with everything.

22:50.669 --> 22:52.471
Well, thanks, but we're fine.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.805
And I'm gonna keep working.

22:53.872 --> 22:54.840
What about school?

22:54.906 --> 22:56.541
You'd always talked about

22:56.608 --> 22:58.376
a graduate program
in French literature.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.644
But that was two years ago, Dad,

22:59.711 --> 23:01.379
and you said that was a waste
of money.

23:01.446 --> 23:02.380
We'll take care of it.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.315
<i>And</i> the baby.

23:03.381 --> 23:06.384
And you can have freedom,
and be a mother.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.385
STEVE:
Excuse me,

23:07.452 --> 23:08.754
but where do I fit

23:08.820 --> 23:10.722
into this happy, well-funded
picture you're painting?

23:10.789 --> 23:11.957
You're the child's father.

23:12.023 --> 23:14.426
You can come visit.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.428
Visit?

23:16.495 --> 23:18.396
Remember how scared
you were in the emergency room?

23:18.463 --> 23:20.031
Well, you won't be with us.

23:20.098 --> 23:23.135
I'm fine here.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.171
But I do need you.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.574
Steve and I both do.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.709
MR. SOSNA:
Please, Janet,

23:30.776 --> 23:32.511
think of what's best
for the child:

23:32.577 --> 23:36.014
raising your baby with us,
or alone with him.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.051
She said no.

23:40.118 --> 23:41.853
Think about it.

23:56.802 --> 23:59.437
Hey, you two!

23:59.504 --> 24:02.841
Thought I told you to place
those calls to room 701.

24:02.908 --> 24:03.775
We did.

24:03.842 --> 24:05.177
You didn't get one, did you?

24:05.243 --> 24:06.878
Oh, did I get one? No.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.146
I got eight.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.749
You know what this means.

24:10.816 --> 24:11.716
War.

24:11.783 --> 24:12.851
Yeah.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.119
Get your stuff.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.921
We're leaving.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.656
Hey, what's going on?

24:17.722 --> 24:18.990
I got fired!

24:19.057 --> 24:21.660
Fired? Hector, wh-why?

24:21.726 --> 24:24.696
Because Mrs. Haverhill found
two large crabs

24:24.763 --> 24:26.131
in her bathtub this morning.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.566
(sighs)

24:27.632 --> 24:29.734
We're just trying
to keep 'em alive.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.170
Yeah, listen, Hector,
I put these guys up to it, okay?

24:32.237 --> 24:33.138
I will take responsibility,

24:33.205 --> 24:35.507
and I will take care
of old Mrs. Haverhill.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.008
I'll send her up some schnapps.

24:37.075 --> 24:38.476
Dylan, this is a hotel,

24:38.543 --> 24:39.744
not a daycare center.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.581
I know, but listen,
as a favor to me,

24:42.647 --> 24:44.049
I'm asking you,

24:44.115 --> 24:45.584
please don't do this.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.220
I'm sorry,
but I have no choice.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.722
Oh, come... Hector!

25:02.200 --> 25:04.636
Noah said the cases
are waiting inside.

25:04.703 --> 25:05.604
Wait! We'll help you.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.673
Figure out what else we need
for the party.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.109
Do roommate things. Whatever.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.746
Roommate things?

25:14.813 --> 25:18.083
Pedicures, collagen
treatments, mud masks.

25:18.149 --> 25:21.720
I told him that I didn't want
to move in with him.

25:21.786 --> 25:23.154
Well, at least
your boyfriend asked.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.623
Noah just told me

25:24.689 --> 25:26.825
he's gonna get his own place.
End of story.

25:26.892 --> 25:30.829
What? Noah was the one
pushing to move in, before...

25:30.896 --> 25:31.930
Before I went
temporarily insane.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.098
Yeah, I know.

25:33.164 --> 25:34.799
Well, is that what he said?

25:34.866 --> 25:36.701
Because if it isn't,
don't assume.

25:36.768 --> 25:38.036
Uh, it's...

25:38.103 --> 25:39.838
Getting over this hurdle
is like our first test

25:39.905 --> 25:41.973
since we've been back together.
We're failing miserably.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.875
We can't commit,

25:43.942 --> 25:46.645
but the ultimate adolescent
Steve Sanders is going

25:46.711 --> 25:48.613
to be a father and a husband.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.016
And we're throwing his
engagement party on the beach

25:51.082 --> 25:52.183
in less than two hours.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.585
We're really behind.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.887
My point exactly.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.555
(engine starts)

26:00.792 --> 26:02.861
Whoo-hoo!

26:02.928 --> 26:06.898
That's it! Last remnants
of the beach party!

26:06.965 --> 26:08.066
Look, I explained.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.835
The "adopted sister" thing
just kinda popped out, okay?

26:10.902 --> 26:12.771
Can you please just run
with it for the party?

26:12.837 --> 26:14.205
I didn't realize you were
so ashamed of us.

26:14.272 --> 26:15.173
I am proud of my family,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.609
but Janet's parents are
completely uptight.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.711
They're coming here tonight
to try and get her

26:19.778 --> 26:22.080
to change her mind and move back
in with them, all right?

26:22.147 --> 26:23.982
So for this evening,
can we just take a deep breath

26:24.049 --> 26:24.983
and rise above, please?!

26:25.050 --> 26:26.318
By lying.

26:26.384 --> 26:27.919
Exactly!

26:29.921 --> 26:31.323
Dad.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.358
-Hey, son.
-I'm so glad you could make it.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.292
Come on in.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.962
Dad, look, this is
very important, okay?

26:37.028 --> 26:38.330
I need you to focus.

26:38.396 --> 26:39.965
-All right.
-See the woman

26:40.031 --> 26:40.999
over my shoulder?

26:41.066 --> 26:42.233
I sure do.

26:42.300 --> 26:42.934
Is she single?

26:43.001 --> 26:44.869
Dad, that's Karen, Mom's lover.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.839
But for tonight,
she's my adopted sister, okay?

26:47.906 --> 26:50.108
See, Janet's parents don't know

26:50.175 --> 26:51.343
that Mom...

26:51.409 --> 26:55.246
Your mother... my ex-wife...

26:55.313 --> 26:56.681
has a lover named Karen?

26:56.748 --> 26:58.049
Yeah, Dad, she's gay.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.318
I thought you knew.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.221
(laughs) We could talk
all about that later,

27:03.288 --> 27:04.622
but for now,

27:04.689 --> 27:06.925
she's my adopted sister,
your daughter, okay?

27:06.992 --> 27:08.793
Please, I'm begging you.
Please, please, please?

27:08.860 --> 27:10.295
Fine, son.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.329
It's your night.

27:11.396 --> 27:12.697
Thanks, Dad.

27:12.764 --> 27:15.000
But no wife of mine was
ever gay!

27:17.068 --> 27:18.036
(Steve chuckles)

27:18.103 --> 27:19.938
GINA:
No, listen, you know what?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.940
I don't want you to worry
about that woman getting fired

27:22.007 --> 27:23.775
'cause her kids,
they're total nightmares.

27:23.842 --> 27:24.609
Come on.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.244
They were just having
a good time.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.979
Yeah, in a juvenile delinquent
sort of way.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.115
Dylan, Noah really wanted
to be here tonight.

27:30.181 --> 27:31.216
Yeah? So why isn't he?

27:31.282 --> 27:33.218
'Cause he's running your club.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.953
Uh, you know, I'd like
a really strong dri...

27:35.020 --> 27:36.654
Oh, do you have any
of those little umbrella...?

27:36.721 --> 27:38.223
Do you think you could relieve
him for once?

27:38.289 --> 27:39.958
Yeah, Donna,
I'll think about it.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.126
GINA:
Um, actually,

27:41.192 --> 27:42.861
I'll just have some wine.

27:42.927 --> 27:43.862
Tonight, please?

27:43.928 --> 27:44.963
Could you fill it

27:45.030 --> 27:45.930
all the way up, because
I'm really thirsty, please?

27:45.997 --> 27:47.132
I'll tell you what.
I'll see what I can do.

27:47.198 --> 27:47.966
Just a little more. Oh!

27:48.033 --> 27:49.434
-(gasps)
-Oh, my God,

27:49.501 --> 27:50.301
I'm so sorry!

27:50.368 --> 27:51.336
(sighs)

27:51.403 --> 27:52.404
Uh, do you want me to help you?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.105
Spare me.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.073
(doorbell rings)

27:55.140 --> 27:56.274
Sorry!

27:56.341 --> 27:58.443
Don't let her guilt-trip you.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.280
Yeah, I'm just not in much of a
luau kind of mood, anyway.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.281
Oh, me neither.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.883
These people give me a headache.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.285
(Hawaiian music playing)

28:07.352 --> 28:10.755
How did your mother
ever marry that man?

28:10.822 --> 28:13.858
-Hey.
-Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Sosna, hello.

28:13.925 --> 28:14.926
Hello, everybody.

28:14.993 --> 28:18.096
And how's my baby girl
tonight?

28:18.163 --> 28:19.998
Oh, you must be the Sosnas.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.066
I'm Rush Sanders,

28:21.132 --> 28:21.966
Steve's dad.

28:22.033 --> 28:22.467
How do you do?

28:22.534 --> 28:23.868
My wife Michelle.

28:23.935 --> 28:26.471
Michelle. This is Karen,
my daughter.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.974
Uh, is Steve's mother here?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.109
Pumpkin,

28:31.176 --> 28:31.876
where's Mommy?

28:31.943 --> 28:32.977
She's on location.

28:34.179 --> 28:36.114
She's a wonderful actress.

28:36.181 --> 28:38.083
She can fake anything.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.117
(thunder crashes)

28:39.184 --> 28:41.019
(gasps)
Sis, Dad, look, poi!

28:41.086 --> 28:43.988
(doorbell rings)

28:44.055 --> 28:45.256
I'll get it!

28:47.425 --> 28:49.994
Hi. Can I help you?

28:50.061 --> 28:51.996
I'm a special guest.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.798
Is Rush Sanders here?

28:53.865 --> 28:55.500
Trish!

28:55.567 --> 28:57.368
-Rush, hi.
-You're here, huh?

28:57.435 --> 28:59.304
Dad, who's your friend?

28:59.370 --> 29:00.338
The entertainment.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.372
STEVE:
What?

29:01.439 --> 29:03.208
I thought it was
a bachelor party.

29:03.274 --> 29:04.976
STEVE (laughs):
Thanks so much for coming,

29:05.043 --> 29:07.245
but we're not gonna need
your services.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.913
TRISH:
That's David Silver!

29:14.352 --> 29:16.121
-Oh, uh...
-Hi.

29:16.187 --> 29:17.122
I'm sorry. You are?

29:17.188 --> 29:18.823
-This is, uh...
-Trish.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.092
Our prospective nanny.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.128
(chuckles)

29:24.262 --> 29:27.098
Promise me you'll keep looking.

29:31.136 --> 29:34.038
David Silver, I recognize you!

29:34.105 --> 29:35.173
Could you take this to Robyn?

29:35.240 --> 29:36.341
I listen to your show,

29:36.407 --> 29:38.176
and-and I've seen your face
around town.

29:38.243 --> 29:40.411
-Yeah?
-Um, can I have your autograph?

29:40.478 --> 29:42.213
-Yeah, yeah, sure.
-Great.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.549
-So, how'd that third date go?
-You know,

29:44.616 --> 29:46.084
I'm gonna need
a napkin or something.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.185
No, no, no, sign here.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.054
More poi, anyone?

29:50.121 --> 29:52.190
You're not serious.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.225
David, come on. Live a little.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.228
(sighs)

29:57.295 --> 29:59.164
So, the third date,
did you sleep with her?

29:59.230 --> 30:00.198
Did you get some?

30:00.265 --> 30:01.466
Come on!

30:01.533 --> 30:02.567
Yeah, yeah, tons, all right?

30:02.634 --> 30:03.935
Thanks.

30:04.002 --> 30:04.502
Thanks a lot.

30:08.439 --> 30:11.442
You could try to explain,
but what could you possibly say?

30:18.116 --> 30:19.951
It's all just a phase.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.586
Samantha's always trying
new things.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.589
I can understand
your feeling of emasculation.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.257
Mm-hmm, I bet you can.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.027
Can you tell when
a woman fakes an orgasm?

30:29.093 --> 30:31.029
Yes, absolutely.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.897
That's not what Mom says.

30:32.964 --> 30:35.066
(thunder crashes)

30:35.133 --> 30:36.301
(sing-songy):
I got something

30:36.367 --> 30:37.235
you don't have.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.369
Penis envy?

30:38.436 --> 30:39.971
All right, that does it!
Come on!

30:40.038 --> 30:42.006
You and me in bed right now!

30:42.073 --> 30:44.342
Your father and your sister?!

30:44.409 --> 30:45.843
Come on, Michelle.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.248
Great.

30:52.417 --> 30:53.918
MR. SOSNA:
Where's your coat?

30:53.985 --> 30:54.852
Hold on a second.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.588
I have a confession
to make. That woman?

30:56.654 --> 30:58.389
She's not my sister.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.358
It doesn't matter.
I've seen enough!

31:00.425 --> 31:01.926
My mom's gay.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.161
Karen is her lover.

31:03.228 --> 31:06.464
Well, that changes everything.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.933
We don't care
who your family is.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.134
STEVE:
That is so not true.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.437
You don't even know me,
and you judge me.

31:12.503 --> 31:14.205
We know you run a gossip sheet.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.373
It's garbage!

31:15.440 --> 31:16.541
I work there, too, Dad.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.210
You said it was temporary,
a lark.

31:19.277 --> 31:20.979
Until you met him.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.581
MRS. SOSNA: We only came here
to get you to move home.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.283
You're wasting your time.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.118
You're wasting our
daughter's potential.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.453
MR. SOSNA:
Janet,

31:28.519 --> 31:30.021
you're a smart girl.

31:30.088 --> 31:30.888
You wanted grad school!

31:30.955 --> 31:32.991
Have you noticed
that my life's gone

31:33.057 --> 31:34.158
in a different direction, Daddy?

31:35.093 --> 31:36.261
That I'm happy?

31:36.327 --> 31:37.962
Do you even care?

31:38.029 --> 31:39.998
Of course we do...

31:40.064 --> 31:42.667
but you're throwing
your life away.

31:42.734 --> 31:46.070
That's right, Dad,
it's <i> my</i> life and <i> my</i> choices.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.472
Admit it,
you're not disappointed

31:47.538 --> 31:50.041
in the man I've chosen,
you're disappointed in me.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.110
You're right, we are.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.093
Okay. I gotta get
to the club. Man!

32:09.160 --> 32:11.062
Oh, um, well, don't go yet.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.431
Wait just one second.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.308
NOAH: Now, we want stripping,
lap dancing;

32:23.374 --> 32:24.609
anything the customer wants.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.678
-(cell phone rings)
-(rock music plays)

32:29.180 --> 32:30.148
Hello.

32:30.214 --> 32:31.983
Noah, listen, you better be done
with auditions.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.184
Look, I need
another hour at least.

32:33.251 --> 32:35.486
No, no, just listen to me.
Donna is guilt-tripping Dylan

32:35.553 --> 32:37.121
about all the hours
you're putting in,

32:37.188 --> 32:38.956
and he's on his way
down there right now.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.058
I need another half an hour.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.259
He's coming right now!

32:41.326 --> 32:42.393
Well, stop him.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.361
How?

32:43.428 --> 32:44.662
I don't know. Use your head.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.197
Improvise. Do something.

32:46.264 --> 32:47.665
No, Noah, I... Hello?

32:47.732 --> 32:50.468
Noah? (sighs)

32:56.441 --> 32:59.544
Um, my headache seems
to have disappeared.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.680
Yeah, so did your clothes.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.649
Oh... yeah.

33:04.716 --> 33:05.516
(chuckles wryly)

33:05.583 --> 33:08.019
Are you sure you have
to go to work?

33:08.086 --> 33:09.721
Yeah.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.090
Um, this looks
like a job for me.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.774
Your parents want to send you
to grad school,

33:29.841 --> 33:32.643
and I've got you digging
through celebrity trash.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.612
Well, maybe I will get
my master's.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.647
Are you afraid
that I won't be able

33:36.714 --> 33:38.616
to take care of you
and the baby?

33:38.683 --> 33:40.685
No, I'm not.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.088
Well, I'm kinda scared

33:44.155 --> 33:45.556
that if you choose me
over your family,

33:45.623 --> 33:46.724
that you're gonna resent me.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.127
My family's
no consolation prize.

33:49.193 --> 33:52.797
It's my father that's making me
choose, okay?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.499
Not you.

33:54.565 --> 33:58.469
And then there's this culture
that I know nothing about.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.705
You never speak Japanese.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.440
I hardly know any.

34:02.507 --> 34:03.775
Neither will your kid.

34:05.109 --> 34:06.477
(sighs)

34:06.544 --> 34:09.447
The worst part
about your family...

34:09.514 --> 34:12.216
they have a point.

34:21.492 --> 34:23.795
Well, thanks to an
anonymous donation,

34:23.860 --> 34:25.596
we've reopened
our after-school program.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.231
-Go on, go.
-Go!

34:29.734 --> 34:31.436
Dylan, I got your message.

34:31.502 --> 34:32.603
You said it was important.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.172
Yes, it is important, Hector.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.107
It's important for you to know

34:36.174 --> 34:39.177
that the hotel will no longer be
functioning as a daycare center,

34:39.243 --> 34:41.612
seeing as how this place
is open for business.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.382
Does that mean
I could have my job back?

34:44.449 --> 34:45.550
You know, I spoke with

34:45.616 --> 34:47.150
old Mrs. Haverhill,

34:47.217 --> 34:49.187
and she's, uh,
she's feeling no pain.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.221
Please, Hector?

34:50.288 --> 34:51.188
I suppose.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.456
Thank you!

34:54.192 --> 34:55.259
But I'm expecting some schnapps.

34:55.326 --> 34:56.860
Oh, and some schnapps
you shall get.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.430
You know, we could use
a guy like you around here.

34:59.497 --> 35:00.631
No, I don't think so.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.333
I'm not really very good
with kids.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.101
Mmm, I don't know about that.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.273
(all laugh)

35:11.209 --> 35:13.878
Trust me, I've been running
this place for two years now.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.848
Kids only mess with the grownups
they like.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.783
Well, if you'll excuse me.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.117
Okay.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.118
Thank you.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.119
I won't disappoint you.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.655
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

35:24.722 --> 35:26.123
Boy, are you gonna get it.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.463
Here we go.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.299
Okay, we got
the answer to our problems.

35:35.366 --> 35:36.634
Tails, I move out...

35:36.701 --> 35:37.902
Heads, I do.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.239
We need to talk.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.241
Hey...

35:46.844 --> 35:48.880
It just kills me that we're
gonna let a coin decide

35:48.946 --> 35:49.747
what we're gonna do.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.516
You mean what <i> I'm</i> gonna do.

35:51.582 --> 35:52.917
Are we gonna talk about this?

35:52.984 --> 35:53.784
'Cause I really want to.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.887
Okay, what do you want
to talk about?

35:55.953 --> 35:56.821
Us moving in together?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.155
Maybe.

35:58.222 --> 35:59.590
(scoffs)
I mean...

35:59.657 --> 36:01.559
we've already been down
that road before.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.227
You said no.

36:03.294 --> 36:04.395
I know.

36:04.462 --> 36:08.432
I just... I freaked out when we
were looking for places.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.767
It's a big decision.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.203
Yeah, it is.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.909
You know all that stuff
I said about liking

36:17.975 --> 36:19.110
how and where I live?

36:19.176 --> 36:23.848
Yeah, there was something
about mud masks, if I recall.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.684
Part of me wants
to live with you so bad.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.386
But?

36:28.452 --> 36:29.887
I'm confused.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.623
Steve and Janet are
getting married,

36:32.690 --> 36:33.858
they're having a baby...

36:33.925 --> 36:34.959
And how does that affect us?

36:35.026 --> 36:37.328
I feel left behind.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.698
And I don't want to commit
to living with you

36:40.765 --> 36:42.867
just because I feel like my life
is passing me by.

36:42.934 --> 36:43.935
Does that make any sense?

36:44.001 --> 36:45.870
Well, you're 25 years old.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.840
I feel a lot older than 25.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.646
Well, I understand.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.481
I know you do.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.450
That's why I love you.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.552
And I love you, too.

37:04.055 --> 37:08.292
Now root for me,
because I hate packing.

37:08.359 --> 37:10.461
Come on.

37:11.829 --> 37:12.863
You ready?

37:12.930 --> 37:13.898
Here we go.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.567
Let's do it.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.840
Noah and I are
moving in together.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.008
Huh!

37:24.075 --> 37:25.476
DONNA:
See...

37:25.543 --> 37:27.979
heads, tails...

37:28.613 --> 37:29.947
...we win.

37:30.014 --> 37:32.650
I want us to live together.

37:32.717 --> 37:33.718
Are you sure?

37:33.784 --> 37:34.986
Absolutely.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.454
(chuckles)

37:39.056 --> 37:40.391
Congratulations.

37:40.458 --> 37:41.926
Yeah, let's, uh,
let's go out and celebrate.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.594
I have to go to work right now,

37:43.661 --> 37:45.863
but we are gonna celebrate
when I get back.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.498
You bet we are.

37:48.966 --> 37:51.302
-See ya.
-All right.

37:52.837 --> 37:53.838
MAN:
<i>Really, man?</i>

37:53.904 --> 37:54.905
MAN 2:
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

37:54.972 --> 37:57.008
STEVE:
Thank you all for coming.

37:57.074 --> 38:00.778
Let's try this
one more time here.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.913
JANET:
We wanted to apologize

38:02.980 --> 38:04.982
for all the mistakes we've made.

38:05.049 --> 38:05.816
We're not proud

38:05.883 --> 38:07.818
of the way we behaved
at the luau.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.286
And we want you to know

38:09.353 --> 38:10.721
we've considered your advice.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.890
I know you think
this is a shotgun wedding.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.959
I'm not holding a gun!

38:15.026 --> 38:17.294
We've begged Janet
not to marry your son!

38:17.361 --> 38:19.697
That's because you don't think
he's good enough for me, Dad.

38:19.764 --> 38:20.998
Wait. Wait a minute.

38:21.065 --> 38:22.566
Who are you,
the Emperor of Siam?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.602
That's Thailand,
by the way, not Japan.

38:24.669 --> 38:25.970
RUSH: Well, you're in America
now, buddy.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.873
Where we've lived and done
business for 43 years.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.341
All right, stop this,
all right?!

38:30.408 --> 38:32.510
Look, it's not
about race or class

38:32.576 --> 38:33.944
or stupid things
that we've said and done.

38:34.011 --> 38:36.614
It's about the fact that Steve
and I love each other

38:36.681 --> 38:38.382
and we're getting married.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.851
I would have proposed,
eventually.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.953
Just so you know.

38:43.020 --> 38:46.924
This baby... this baby's
just an added bonus.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.694
JANET:
So you can be happy for us

38:49.760 --> 38:51.429
and be a part of
this child's life,

38:51.495 --> 38:53.030
and you can share
all the things

38:53.097 --> 38:54.131
that you have to offer.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.934
Or you could sit back
and wait and see if we fail.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.436
JANET:
It's your choice.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.336
STEVE:
'Cause right now,

38:59.403 --> 39:02.039
we have our own
family to think about.

39:16.921 --> 39:17.688
Um...

39:17.755 --> 39:20.124
You weren't gonna tell me,
were you?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.959
About what?

39:22.026 --> 39:23.994
About your anonymous
contribution

39:24.061 --> 39:25.930
to the community center.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.898
Oh, Hector, he ratted me out.

39:27.965 --> 39:29.500
Hector's a rat.

39:29.567 --> 39:30.735
He's proud, though.

39:32.570 --> 39:33.671
Kiss me.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.050
(sighs)
Lift your head.

39:47.585 --> 39:50.888
Oh! Ooh!

39:50.955 --> 39:51.956
Mmm.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.160
You know, you don't,
you don't have to go.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.531
That's a switch.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.933
I'm a little slow on the uptake,
but I learn.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.602
(chuckles)

40:07.905 --> 40:10.407
You know...

40:10.474 --> 40:12.943
despite how hard you try
to hide it,

40:13.010 --> 40:14.779
you can be a pretty great guy.

40:14.845 --> 40:16.514
You know that?

40:16.580 --> 40:17.915
Some of the time.

40:25.122 --> 40:26.190
So, stay with me.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.759
I can't.

40:33.063 --> 40:36.100
(door opens, closes)

40:39.670 --> 40:41.939
(loud rock music playing)

40:53.150 --> 40:54.819
Hey, what's up?

40:54.885 --> 40:55.686
I feel like a pimp.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.221
You look like a pimp.
Give me numbers.

40:59.924 --> 41:01.692
Three grand and change.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.027
Your half.

41:03.093 --> 41:06.230
Whoa. My ha... my half?

41:06.297 --> 41:07.932
Yeah, I'm doing this
for Donna, okay?

41:07.998 --> 41:09.767
I know. That's so romantic.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.236
I'm doing this for me. Me.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.148
You didn't pick up the phone,
so...

41:24.215 --> 41:25.950
No, I'm picking up...

41:26.016 --> 41:27.017
selectively.

41:27.084 --> 41:28.919
You know,

41:28.986 --> 41:31.021
I'm just talking to you right
now because I'm curious.

41:31.088 --> 41:31.989
Did we sleep together
again tonight?

41:32.056 --> 41:33.791
Was it good for me, David,

41:33.858 --> 41:34.892
hmm?

41:34.959 --> 41:36.760
Yeah, we did.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.797
And I was great.

41:39.864 --> 41:40.865
Yeah.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.233
Robyn,

41:42.299 --> 41:45.169
I don't know why I lied
about that.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.238
Because you're David Silver.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.572
You shoot, you score, right?

41:48.639 --> 41:50.774
Something like that.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.010
You know, when I was
in high school,

41:53.077 --> 41:54.778
I wasn't like I am now.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.580
I never would have had

41:56.647 --> 41:58.682
a radio guy
with a three-date rule.

41:58.749 --> 42:00.951
I fell in love

42:01.018 --> 42:02.653
with this girl,
and I actually waited years

42:02.720 --> 42:03.687
before I slept with her.

42:03.754 --> 42:04.788
David,

42:04.855 --> 42:07.024
it's been a really long time
since I found somebody

42:07.091 --> 42:07.958
that I could trust.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.961
I gotta be honest
with you. You scare me.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.797
Because when I see you
standing at my door,

42:13.864 --> 42:16.901
I don't know which guy you are
standing there.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.002
It's me.

42:18.068 --> 42:19.904
Robyn, it's just me.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.639
Whoever that is.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.040
But you know,
I gotta tell you,

42:23.107 --> 42:25.242
that guy that you talk about
from high school...

42:25.309 --> 42:27.044
Yeah.

42:27.111 --> 42:29.980
That's the guy that I would have
liked to have met.
