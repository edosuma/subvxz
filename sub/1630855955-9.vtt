WEBVTT

00:06.093 --> 00:07.268
I'’ve come to a realization

00:07.268 --> 00:08.834
I don'’t want an
open relationship.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.923
He can do what he wants,
but you can'’t do what you want?

00:10.923 --> 00:12.273
I don'’t know about that.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.017
Now, this other persons
come along, but in my heart,

00:17.017 --> 00:18.931
I do love my boyfriend.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.672
I feel like I have to push away.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.109
Love is crap.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.414
I'’m gonna keep it to a
bare minimum with you.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.720
I'’m not even gonna talk to you.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.461
Should we talk about
how Tumi and Jess

00:26.461 --> 00:28.941
are gonna run
service this charter?

00:33.163 --> 00:34.251
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.427
- That'’s so rude.
- I know.

00:38.038 --> 00:38.995
No, no, no.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.431
Like, I'’m not capable.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.606
You definitely are
interpreting that wrong.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.652
Why would she say that?
I mean, come on.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.045
That literally had nothing
to do with you.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.699
See the current message.

00:47.699 --> 00:48.787
What?

00:48.787 --> 00:51.007
Bottom bit, hon.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.443
It'’s like manipulating.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.792
I wouldn'’t have second guessed

00:53.792 --> 00:56.317
if she didn'’t make me
think about it.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.667
That'’s exactly what I'm seeing.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.758
Tomorrow, the owners
arranged a day off for you

01:02.758 --> 01:04.760
to go have some fun,

01:04.760 --> 01:06.283
to blow some steam.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.554
Luka'’s just suddenly
gone super cold on me.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.558
It'’s very icy vibes towards me.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.871
What'’s S?

01:28.871 --> 01:30.307
No, baby.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.360
Kyle, a part of a community
is supposed

01:39.360 --> 01:41.013
to be accepted by
every community.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.667
Not you.
This is Natalya.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.148
She loves to poke her nose
in other people'’s business.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.584
Stay in your lane.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.370
You will never get
under my skin. Never.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.589
You can disappear.
I don'’t feel bad.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.113
I will speak my----ing
mind, bitch.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.331
Chill out.

01:54.331 --> 01:55.593
Why do you want
to come into my life?

01:55.593 --> 01:56.899
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.161
Kyle.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.166
- Kyle.
- Not you. Take a back seat.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.168
You don'’t get to tell me
to take a back seat.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.561
I'’m gonna tell you whatever
the [bleep] I want to tell you.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.389
Don'’t tell me to
take a back seat.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.781
I'’m one of your friends.
Don'’t talk to me like that.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.740
I will talk to you the way
I want to, honey.

02:11.740 --> 02:12.915
- Guys, guys.
- Don'’t call me honey.

02:12.915 --> 02:13.916
Guys, guys, guys.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.570
Kyle, stop saying honey.

02:15.570 --> 02:18.442
- Don'’t call my name.
- Don'’t call me honey.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.358
- You will never control me.
- Kyle, take a water.

02:21.358 --> 02:25.188
You will never control me.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.059
Never, baby.

02:27.059 --> 02:31.629
I don'’t feel feathers for you.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.595
Well, you just started.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.074
I can start and
I can also end it.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.380
Trust me, I'’ll continue
with this

02:43.380 --> 02:44.381
until the end of the
- ing charter.

02:44.381 --> 02:45.600
Don'’t test me, bitch.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.950
I'’m just gonna...
speak your mind.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.212
I don'’t give a [bleep].

02:49.212 --> 02:50.213
You don'’t direct
my speaking, bitch.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.823
Kyle, chill.

02:51.823 --> 02:54.261
I don'’t need you to control
everybody'’s opinion.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.915
Focus on your own
- ed up life.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.700
Before you----ed up on ours.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.092
Yes, you'’ve controlled
everybody'’s opinion.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.093
No, not me.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.704
Not me.
Not me.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.488
Kyle, I'’ve never been
spoken to in my life

03:04.488 --> 03:05.707
and I can'’t believe that
actually, you'’re saying it.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.534
It'’s tragic.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.796
I'’m not gonna respond.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.101
because honestly,
then you'’ll see.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.102
Then don'’t respond to this.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.582
I can'’t believe you--

03:21.244 --> 03:22.463
Perfect.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.468
Kyle, you are a horrible human

03:27.468 --> 03:28.817
and you'’re a nasty human

03:28.817 --> 03:30.688
and that'’s what
I'’m leaving you with.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.429
I'’m in absolute shock
from what'’s just been said.

03:32.429 --> 03:35.954
Kyle'’s not this lovely,
excepting yes, queen person

03:35.954 --> 03:37.304
that he thinks he is.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.262
What'’s the point of
arguing with Satan?

03:39.262 --> 03:41.221
ing hell.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.526
I don'’t know...

03:45.877 --> 03:46.965
Yeah.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.620
I don'’t know.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.493
ing man.
What is this----ing sh--?

03:52.493 --> 03:55.365
I'’m done arguing with
a bunch of imbeciles.

03:59.717 --> 04:04.026
She constantly inserts herself
in things that don'’t matter

04:04.026 --> 04:05.506
or are relevant to her.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.290
I'’m sick and tired of
hearing the gossip.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.162
I'’m sick and tired of her
talking behind people'’s backs.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.512
I'’ve absolutely had it with her.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.948
Who do you think you are?

04:18.345 --> 04:19.737
I'’m like...

04:19.737 --> 04:21.783
No, I'’m not.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.525
Okay, just a cuddle.
Just a cuddle.

04:24.525 --> 04:25.526
Yeah?

04:25.526 --> 04:26.875
I'’m not dealing with this.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.529
That behavior
there wasn'’t right.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.052
Is this a genuine friendship

04:30.052 --> 04:32.489
and we just have sister,
brother, banter or is it not?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.361
He did this to me last year.
He snapped to me.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.101
I'’ve got nothing else more
to explain to you

04:36.101 --> 04:37.233
than what I did.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.452
You'’re looking for attention.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.540
You'’re not going to
get it from me.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.758
I----ing apologized to you.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.325
You'’ve got more
problems with me.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.457
I'’m not literally
coming out of here.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.806
your
- ing sh--.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.068
I walked down and it
was just like, rawr.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.374
Yeah, it was all of a sudden.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.853
We walked into a fire.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.421
I'’m quite upset about
the whole situation.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.162
Like, obviously
they'’re both my friends

04:53.162 --> 04:57.253
and that wasn'’t good of her
to mix in with a conversation.

04:57.253 --> 05:01.779
Him going off on her like he did
was completely unacceptable.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.912
He'’s just going
from one to another.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.261
He hates this one
and he loves this one

05:05.261 --> 05:07.045
and----ing hates another.

05:07.045 --> 05:10.005
I can'’t keep up with where
he'’s at with anyone, you know?

05:10.005 --> 05:13.530
I'’m just chilling with you
until you fall asleep.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.273
No, I'’m over that.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.448
But you kissed her.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.452
Is it like I'’ve been
there, done that thing?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.300
Because of me?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.433
Or because of your attitude?

05:51.351 --> 05:54.963
In the future, do not say...

05:54.963 --> 05:56.356
Okay, I learn something.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.835
What am I going to say?

05:57.835 --> 06:01.926
I love that. In the future,
I can include my...

06:01.926 --> 06:04.364
That'’s it.
And that you'’re an ally.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.452
Okay, can we agree on that?

06:05.452 --> 06:06.931
- That'’s all.
- Okay.

06:06.931 --> 06:10.979
And I promise you,
we'’re not the problem.

06:10.979 --> 06:11.893
Yes.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.503
You and I are not the problem.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.766
I'’m upset with Natalya
that she shut my voice up.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.818
I learned this tonight, ally.

06:23.818 --> 06:24.732
There we go.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.473
So, it was a language barrier.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.133
I know.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.614
- Take care of you.
- Love you, babes.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.356
We don'’t fit here.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.448
Hi, are you okay?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.102
Tell me how you feeling.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.756
I don'’t know.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.627
I just feel like what he said
was actually really horrible.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.368
I didn'’t know that stuff
was buried there

06:52.368 --> 06:53.848
and that'’s what shocks me

06:53.848 --> 06:55.676
because, like, I didn'’t
know where that came from.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.026
At least what me and you,
we speak to each other

06:58.026 --> 07:00.550
but then we'’re kind
of like, yeah, okay.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.813
My biggest worry is
just like, obviously.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.641
Now, are you okay to sleep here?

07:04.641 --> 07:07.122
Yeah, I'’m fine.
Like, I feel safe. It'’s fine.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.559
Look, it wasn'’t Natalya's
battle to butt in to

07:09.559 --> 07:11.953
because there was a fight
between Kyle and Max

07:11.953 --> 07:13.476
and she should have
just left it at that.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.912
But I'’m not an asshole.

07:14.912 --> 07:18.350
Kyle'’s behavior was
totally inexcusable.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.701
I feel like separating them,

07:20.701 --> 07:22.354
letting them breathe

07:22.354 --> 07:24.182
and then they have to have
a conversation and resolve it.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.054
Like, there'’s only so
much I can do

07:26.054 --> 07:27.272
but they need
to pull their weight.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.926
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.375
Where are you going?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.203
To my bed because it'’s hot.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.249
It'’s hot as----ing balls.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.293
That'’s bullsh--.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.512
I'’m shook.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.731
Was he not just
flirting with Natalia?

07:50.731 --> 07:53.516
Wear your shirt, though.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.822
Excuse me.
off, Tumi.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.171
But Luka'’s a Scorpio.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.217
He will eat anything
that comes his way.

08:01.829 --> 08:05.049
Jessika, you have to explain to
me what the [bleep] this was.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.530
I'’m going to bed.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.097
- Get some rest.
- Love you.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.209
Wait, with who?

08:44.219 --> 08:47.527
All crew, all crew,
wake the [bleep] up.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.575
We need to be there at 11.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.750
I need food.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.535
I'’m going to die.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.625
Ugh.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.670
Hi, girl.
How are you?

09:00.670 --> 09:01.976
Are you excited for
your beach day?

09:01.976 --> 09:04.239
Oh, my God.
I'’m so----ing hungover.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.327
How are you feeling?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.981
What the
is going on?

09:06.981 --> 09:10.854
For me, I never want you to
feel, like, so uncomfortable.

09:10.854 --> 09:11.768
Yeah.

09:11.768 --> 09:12.900
So that'’s my main priority,

09:12.900 --> 09:13.944
regardless of how
I feel about you

09:13.944 --> 09:15.467
or how I feel about anyone.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.208
It'’s just, like,
I just want you to feel safe.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.514
Yeah.

09:18.514 --> 09:19.646
I can get my...

09:19.646 --> 09:20.995
The work for me
is the easy part.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.084
It'’s just, like,
I can'’t deal with that.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.433
I get it.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.740
I just feel, like,
Kyle'’s extremely fake.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.219
It'’s disappointing,

09:28.219 --> 09:29.525
because I thought we were
actually good friends.

09:31.222 --> 09:34.835
I don'’t want to be in a team
where I don'’t feel valued

09:34.835 --> 09:38.273
and I don'’t feel appreciated
and I feel, like, sh--.

09:38.273 --> 09:39.361
I don'’t know.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.884
I'’m staying here till later,

09:40.884 --> 09:42.494
because I didn'’t want to
cross over him in the cabin,

09:42.494 --> 09:45.019
and then I was going to come
in a couple of hours.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.063
Text me.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.151
Okay, thank you.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.326
- See you, babe.
- Bye-bye, thank you.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.113
Coming up...

09:52.113 --> 09:54.681
Oh, this is so cute.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.117
You guys...

09:56.117 --> 09:58.554
There'’s been stuff going
on within the interior.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.861
I tried to tell
Kyle to calm down.

10:00.861 --> 10:03.298
I thought he'’s one of
my best friends, so...

10:03.298 --> 10:06.301
That'’s not okay.
That'’s bullying.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.568
I'’m just eating cereal.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.440
Okay, everyone, let'’s not fight
and start with love each other.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.354
So why are we...

10:16.354 --> 10:18.356
No, Lara want to fight with you.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.665
This hangover is----ing real.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.014
This morning when I woke up,

10:24.014 --> 10:25.842
I told myself I was
never drinking again.

10:25.842 --> 10:26.887
Well, uh...

10:28.932 --> 10:30.151
What are you guys doing?

10:30.151 --> 10:31.587
We'’re going to get dressed.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.545
I'’ll stay on the boat today
and just tan.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.593
I want to come,
but I just, like,

10:37.593 --> 10:39.247
right now I can'’t get in my
room because he'’s in there,

10:39.247 --> 10:40.814
so I'’m just going to wait.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.250
I'’m going to wait until I
say that you guys to leave

10:42.250 --> 10:43.686
and if anything,
I'’ll join later.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.340
What'’s going on, mother----ers?

10:45.340 --> 10:46.297
Yes, look.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.734
How was your night last night?

10:47.734 --> 10:49.474
- Did you hook up?
- No.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.302
- How are we, love?
- Did you get a kiss?

10:51.302 --> 10:52.129
No.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.783
You guys were pretty cozy.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.959
Yeah, cozy, but...

10:55.959 --> 10:58.701
This is----ing awkward.

10:58.701 --> 11:03.750
What about you? What happened
with you last night?

11:03.750 --> 11:04.881
Rawr!

11:04.881 --> 11:06.143
I'’m going to go get changed.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.232
What are we wearing
today, my girl?

11:08.232 --> 11:11.148
Pants down.
Ass cheeks----ing out.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.891
Good morning.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.066
How you doing?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.459
I am thriving.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.895
Yeah?

11:18.895 --> 11:19.940
What?

11:19.940 --> 11:21.158
You got a minute?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.726
Shall I do it
here on the floor?

11:23.726 --> 11:24.727
- Yeah.
- God.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.209
I don'’t know where to start.
I'’ve never done this before.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.645
Oh, that'’s it.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.255
I'’ve got the biggest
baby face ever, right,

11:31.255 --> 11:34.824
and I look at my back,
I look like King Kong.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.652
I can'’t go to
the beach club with that.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.002
You know, it'’s going
to be women there. Come on.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.657
I'’m not, like, cutting you,
am I?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.006
Ow!

11:43.964 --> 11:45.269
This is why I'’m gay, you know?

11:45.269 --> 11:47.750
That'’s why exactly
why I'’m gay.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.969
- Okay, this is...
- I'’ll do that.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.318
Thank you, Lara.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.319
Yo.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.755
What'’s happening? Are you going?

11:52.755 --> 11:53.843
- Uh-huh.
- Coming?

11:53.843 --> 11:54.975
No. I want to sleep.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.106
No, come on.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.368
my bed, you know.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.848
Max, what'’s wrong with you?

11:58.848 --> 12:00.110
Yeah, come on.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.111
Oh, you'’re coming later?

12:01.111 --> 12:03.331
All right, no worries.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.610
All right, let'’s gather
this----ing base camp.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.220
Let'’s go!

12:23.220 --> 12:25.353
Oh, my gosh, it'’s hot.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.703
I feels sick in the back.
I hope not.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.531
Give me a beer.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.185
This is going to
be a great day.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.752
Get the coconut oil out.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.800
The shame was it was
such a great night before.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.193
It was.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.151
There'’s a bad vibe now.
You can feel it.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.371
Yeah, yeah.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.764
Hello.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.461
Oh, it'’s you.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.245
I thought it was someone else.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.553
Because I'’m quitting.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.336
Qua?

12:52.336 --> 12:53.642
- Yeah.
- Why?

12:53.642 --> 12:55.513
What?

12:55.513 --> 12:57.341
Okay, leave me alone,
I'’ll leave her alone, too.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.256
I don'’t give a [bleep].

13:01.650 --> 13:03.260
Last night, how he
spoke to me...

13:03.260 --> 13:06.742
It was water drop that
make everything overflow.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.526
Yeah, I'’m out tomorrow.

13:08.526 --> 13:11.747
I don'’t like giving up, but it's
been such a sh-- season for me.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.445
I came on, already confused as
about my relationship.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.230
Then I have to deal with
the Tuminator,

13:16.230 --> 13:17.884
confusion of feelings for Luka.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.537
Then I deal with Vile Kyle.

13:19.537 --> 13:23.237
I'’m just ready to throw in
the napkin at this point.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.369
I think we go and we just sit.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.241
We don'’t have to sit
with them as a beach club.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.809
Let'’s just enjoy the sunshine.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.900
- Look at that.
- So pretty.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.162
We made it.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.772
- Are you ready?
- We are always.

13:36.772 --> 13:37.773
Welcome to heaven.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.383
Oh my God.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.776
- Hi.
- Hello. Welcome.

13:40.776 --> 13:44.780
Me and Zina show you all
the place around here.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.913
Kylie!

13:46.913 --> 13:48.262
How gorgeous.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.046
This is amazing.

13:50.046 --> 13:54.398
Oh, this is so cute.
You guys!

13:54.398 --> 13:57.924
The beach club is so beautiful.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.403
And for the team,

13:59.403 --> 14:01.884
this couldn'’t have come
at a better time.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.625
This is meant to be
a relaxing day off

14:03.625 --> 14:07.324
where we can de-stress
and get over last night.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.065
And if it can'’t be solved
with alcohol,

14:09.065 --> 14:12.939
then we'’ve got a problem.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.202
Don'’t poop on me, bird.

14:15.202 --> 14:19.119
You know, I'’m always in the sun,
but no one'’s son's ever in me.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.163
You know what I mean?

14:21.599 --> 14:23.471
We'’re getting----ed up.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.821
That is juice.
It'’s happy juice.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.829
I'’m not having the friends
that I thought I would have.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.135
I feel that.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.745
I definitely think you should
just take today

14:36.745 --> 14:38.921
and just chill and
then sleep on it

14:38.921 --> 14:40.444
and see how you'’re feeling.

14:40.444 --> 14:44.666
I do wish we had drama
like the interior team did.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.149
We can have.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.499
We can create some.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.153
- All right.
- Let'’s go.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.328
Food!

14:54.328 --> 14:55.938
Right here in front of us.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.853
Thank you.

14:57.853 --> 14:58.854
You'’re amazing.

15:01.726 --> 15:02.684
Hello, guys.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.728
Ooh, la la.

15:03.728 --> 15:04.860
Hello, people.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.209
You made it.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.950
- There'’s our little menu.
- Hello, my loves.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.911
I don'’t want to be here.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.173
No.
Sorry, honey.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.696
All right.
Who wants to do a round?

15:14.696 --> 15:15.871
Is there a menu?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.655
You just ask the lady.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.005
I'’ll go get her.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.181
I think we'’d need
a miracle for the interior

15:21.181 --> 15:22.486
to come back from this.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.446
- Hello.
- My love bugs.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.799
Tumi, I can tell you
that if she'’s staying,

15:30.799 --> 15:32.148
I'’m leaving and
that'’s the facts.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.193
I just...

15:33.193 --> 15:34.977
Right now...

15:39.851 --> 15:40.852
Yeah.

15:43.203 --> 15:46.206
I'’m going to get the waitress
because I need a----ing drink.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.598
Yeah, tell her what.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.908
But...

15:52.908 --> 15:53.953
Yes.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.954
Yeah, okay.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.564
I'’m not going crazy.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.782
All I'’m saying is I'm
just keeping distance now.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.001
But you know where I am.
I'’m fine.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.350
Okay.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.656
Having a wee, then you'’re
going to go sit.

16:01.656 --> 16:02.874
Okay.
I'’m going to have a wee as well.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.007
Huh? Yeah.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.748
Is this my parma ham
pizza you'’re eating?

16:06.748 --> 16:08.271
I got one.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.620
Can I eat this as well and
then you have some of mine?

16:09.620 --> 16:10.404
Yeah.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.450
Thank you.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.583
So you'’re in a mood
with me since yesterday?

16:15.583 --> 16:18.673
I'’m so tired today.
I'’m not in a mood.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.199
I don'’t understand
what is happening.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.722
Luka didn'’t stand up for me.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.724
And also that Luka
didn'’t come check in on me.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.596
Like, hey, that was really
hectic what Kyle said to you.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.728
Like, I just expected
a little more support

16:30.728 --> 16:31.947
from you last night and today.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.601
I hate that everyone is
just so calm

16:33.601 --> 16:35.298
about what happened last night.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.865
I can'’t do this.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.303
Don'’t hit the red button.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.612
What are you reading?

16:44.612 --> 16:45.743
No.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.103
Yeah.
Life coach, that'’s what he is.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.321
Yeah.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.670
I'’m very spiritual
with that.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.063
Like law of attraction
and all that.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.327
Like I try to put that
good energy into the world

17:04.327 --> 17:06.851
if I put in bad energy.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.506
Your energy is, I hate when
people go, energy, good vibes.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.073
I'’ve been for you every
single----ing day.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.857
You'’ve not spoken
to me since I arrived.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.294
You'’ve not wrote me
once last night or messages

17:14.294 --> 17:16.035
this morning checking
in with me.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.819
Did you check in with
me this morning

17:17.819 --> 17:19.299
or last night when you knew
this stuff was going down?

17:19.299 --> 17:21.040
I didn'’t check in with you.
That'’s true.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.780
And the fact that you know
stuff went down last night

17:22.780 --> 17:24.695
and you haven'’t even come
and visited me once

17:24.695 --> 17:26.306
shows a lot about you.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.830
I was there for Jess for
everything from day one.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.488
You can be chief stew.
Don'’t doubt yourself.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.532
ing amazing at service.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.099
Weird though.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.623
For her to turn around and
then not even check in on me

17:39.623 --> 17:41.799
or stand up for me to fight
just says a lot about her.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.106
Like, she needs to be told that
she'’s actually a bitch

17:44.106 --> 17:46.369
and she'’s not this good
little energy girl

17:46.369 --> 17:47.718
that she thinks she is.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.329
Please do not preach
about starting a day off

17:49.329 --> 17:50.678
with good energy.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.506
When I was in a bad place
this morning,

17:52.506 --> 17:53.811
you didn'’t message me once.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.291
Okay.
You are very right.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.076
No, you'’re very right.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.556
Coming up...

17:59.556 --> 18:01.167
That is the van to be in.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.648
Whoa!

18:04.648 --> 18:06.389
Ah!

18:06.389 --> 18:08.391
I don'’t feel...
something'’s not right.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.486
Please do not preach
about starting a day off

18:16.486 --> 18:17.835
with good energy.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.272
When I was in a bad place
this morning,

18:19.272 --> 18:20.577
you knew you didn'’t
message me once.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.753
Or yesterday.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.320
Okay.
You are very right.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.453
No, you'’re very right.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.715
And that'’s what I mean.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.195
Like, I'’m not
a perfect person.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.196
Yeah, we are not perfect.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.501
It'’s crazy.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.068
I'’m talking to you
about my life.

18:33.068 --> 18:37.203
And suddenly my life
becomes something else.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.162
I do feel a little bad for her.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.425
The Luka situation,
the Kyle situation,

18:42.425 --> 18:43.687
the Tumi situation.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.385
But at the same time,
she put herself

18:45.385 --> 18:48.779
in all of those situations
and she'’s taking it out on me.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.565
That'’s like a simple fact
of me not trying to be

18:51.565 --> 18:53.088
in other people'’s drama.

18:53.088 --> 18:54.959
Yo, it'’s time for you
to wake up.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.309
You haven'’t even finished
your old fashioned.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.527
I wish we had cards.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.789
We could have played
a card game.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.008
- I know, we should have.
- We don'’t have?

19:00.008 --> 19:00.878
What about this one?

19:00.878 --> 19:02.402
- Heads up.
- Heads up.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.403
We can do heads up.

19:03.403 --> 19:04.534
Jess, get your ass here.

19:04.534 --> 19:05.753
Okay.

19:05.753 --> 19:06.884
Hello.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.852
And there'’s like good people,
but everyone'’s mixing together.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.245
It just doesn'’t,
it just doesn'’t feel good.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.595
- She has an umbrella.
- She has an umbrella.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.553
- I'’m Mary Poppins.
- Yes!

19:23.553 --> 19:24.989
I'’m just really
- ing stressed.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.687
Like my anxiety is
through the roof.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.776
And I'’m stuck at this
- ing beach club.

19:28.776 --> 19:29.907
I shouldn'’t have even
come to today.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.910
- Bend it like Beckham!
- Yes!

19:32.910 --> 19:34.347
Oh, I'’m going
where it'’s the boat.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.566
I'’ll pack my bag.
I just want to get off it.

19:36.566 --> 19:39.178
I'’m not spending one
more night on it.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.011
I feel a big
divide between myself

19:47.011 --> 19:48.578
and the rest of the crew
because of what'’s happened.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.233
And I feel like no one
really cares about

19:51.233 --> 19:53.148
what'’s happened to Natalya,
the way she'’s getting treated.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.194
I'’m going to bend
you like Beckham!

20:01.809 --> 20:04.551
I mean, she literally yelled at
me when I was talking to Max.

20:04.551 --> 20:07.293
She can'’t believe I'm talking
about how I'’m good energy

20:07.293 --> 20:10.121
and all this when she'’s been
there for me since day one.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.297
You see what I'’m saying?

20:11.297 --> 20:12.820
You know, I was like,
you'’re right.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.430
I haven'’t been involved
in your issues

20:14.430 --> 20:15.997
because I just had an issue

20:15.997 --> 20:17.651
and I don'’t want to be
involved in another issue.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.261
Another issue
that isn'’t your issue.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.568
Like [bleep].

20:21.568 --> 20:24.832
Natalya is 100%
a short-fused martyr.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.964
I have a lot of regrets.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.315
How I said things,
how I reacted.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.839
But the emotion that
I'’ve been feeling

20:31.839 --> 20:34.145
is still coming back
every time I see her.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.367
You'’ve been a fake-ass bitch.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.108
You'’ve been talking sh--
behind my back since day one.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.065
Kyle, chill.

20:41.065 --> 20:44.025
Focus on your own----ed
up life.

20:44.025 --> 20:47.463
You are a horrible human
and you'’re a nasty human

20:47.463 --> 20:48.638
and that'’s where I'm leaving it.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.075
What time is dinner?

20:51.075 --> 20:53.295
We'’ve all got to get in the same
van tonight, by the way.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.384
I don'’t care if someone's
on my lap.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.472
We'’re getting in there.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.213
Who'’s on your lap?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.867
You.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.085
Oh.

21:02.522 --> 21:03.653
How are you, brother?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.090
You'’re good?

21:12.923 --> 21:13.663
Nice.

21:13.663 --> 21:14.708
Tomorrow'’s a new day.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.579
You going to come for dinner?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.713
Time to get ready.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.323
Follow the leader.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.717
I'’m ready.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.197
You'’ve been ready.
Look at you, sis.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.681
Ta-da.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.343
Oh, this is beautiful.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.128
Oh, I don'’t need to taste.
You don'’t worry about it.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.304
Just pour.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.524
Exactly the same.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.570
Seven long islands.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.267
And then blowjob shots, please.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.051
Ooh!

21:56.445 --> 21:57.968
I just want to make sure that
all my stuff'’s out the cabin.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.274
I want nothing to do with Kyle,

21:59.274 --> 22:01.145
and I'’m going to
save my conversation

22:01.145 --> 22:02.669
with Captain Sandy
until the morning,

22:02.669 --> 22:04.105
just so I can have
a clearer head.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.411
Like, right now I just
want to pack my stuff

22:05.411 --> 22:07.848
and make sure I want to
go through with this.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.764
Thank you.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.113
That looks extra long.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.810
Who'’s ready to go down
to Pound Town?

22:13.810 --> 22:14.942
Cheers to you guys.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.944
My family away from the people

22:16.944 --> 22:17.945
I actually want
to hang out with.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.338
I'’m just kidding.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.958
Huh?

22:30.958 --> 22:33.917
Nat just asked for a suitcase,
so she'’s leaving tomorrow.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.225
What is what?
What'’s happening?

22:37.225 --> 22:38.531
Tumi left the chat.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.794
To be honest, we handled
it with three people.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.012
We can do it again.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.318
More people, more complacency.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.886
The reality is,
Natalya'’s not my friend.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.627
We'’re playing nice
for the sake of work,

22:47.627 --> 22:48.802
because she'’s good at her job.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.021
If she feels like
she wants to go,

22:51.021 --> 22:52.283
I'’m not holding her back.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.850
Like, she wants to go,
she can go.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.417
What are you guys
going to do this charter?

22:55.417 --> 22:56.853
Are you guys going to
get another person?

22:56.853 --> 22:58.333
I think we'’ll be
fine with three.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.421
No offence or weirdness.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.944
If you want to move
to that cabin,

23:00.944 --> 23:02.468
you let me know and
I'’ll swap with you.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.773
Would I be in there by myself?

23:03.773 --> 23:05.340
Tumi?
Why don'’t you move to the cabin?

23:05.340 --> 23:08.430
Oh, hell no, bitch. I'’m staying
with my pillowcases.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.431
Girl.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.432
We'’ll see.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.868
Everyone'’s like, okay.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.827
Like, does no one
to feel bothered about

23:13.827 --> 23:15.132
one of our crew members
just leaving,

23:15.132 --> 23:16.177
because of all this sh--
that'’s going on?

23:16.177 --> 23:17.744
Just doesn'’t sit right with me.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.267
But I am warning you,
if you go to the cabin,

23:19.267 --> 23:21.051
all you'’re going to hear
is them two.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.444
They do not----ing shut up.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.492
Let'’s go, guys.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.102
I'’ll sit in the back with Lara.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.408
Doll.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.453
Being drunk in the car
is a guillotine for me.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.498
I lose my head, bro.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.629
The guillotine.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.936
Losing my head, bro.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.507
Penny, I can'’t feel
bad for everyone.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.465
What do you think
is happening with Max?

23:43.465 --> 23:45.162
Because he wasn'’t with
us all night.

23:45.162 --> 23:49.036
I personally feel like Max
is feeling home sick.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.473
Have you spoken to Kyle today?

23:51.473 --> 23:53.997
There'’s certain individuals
that I truly love

23:53.997 --> 23:55.521
a bit more than others.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.045
Example.
I don'’t love Max.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.786
I cannot care for how he feels,

23:59.786 --> 24:01.744
because it'’s too much energy.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.835
- Yeah.
- I don'’t feel good about it.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.060
Coming up...

24:13.060 --> 24:14.844
The common denominator is Kyle.

24:19.675 --> 24:20.676
Sh--.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.504
Have a seat.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.080
I don'’t feel like...
something'’s not right.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.299
I'’m flashing my nipple,
here goes everything.

24:35.299 --> 24:38.564
Yay!

24:46.572 --> 24:47.921
Is the thong coming out?

24:47.921 --> 24:50.358
Oh, it'’s coming out,
it'’s coming out.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.406
Me, bro, I love everyone,
you know?

24:55.406 --> 24:57.365
And I don'’t see these
kind of things, you know.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.502
Whoa!

25:05.982 --> 25:09.072
- Yeah, I'’m going.
- Come on, let'’s go.

25:10.030 --> 25:10.987
No, no, I'’m going to sleep.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.424
Can you bring this too?

25:13.424 --> 25:15.035
Thank you, I love you.

25:21.389 --> 25:22.390
Yeah.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.437
- What?
- Luka.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.874
What?

25:45.631 --> 25:47.546
I'’ve always been
a relationship girl.

25:47.546 --> 25:53.160
I think the longest I was
single was maybe four months.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.379
Well, my first relationship,
I was 16,

25:55.379 --> 25:57.077
and that lasted for two years.

25:57.077 --> 25:59.079
And then I ended up
with someone else,

25:59.079 --> 26:00.689
and that was six months.

26:00.689 --> 26:01.821
He was from Vegas.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.083
Don'’t date a Vegas guy.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.824
That'’s when I was like,
okay, whatever,

26:04.824 --> 26:05.999
I'’ll just be single.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.697
And then I met my
third boyfriend,

26:08.697 --> 26:10.830
and that lasted six years.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.571
I just give my all.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.920
Like, here, take my heart.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.582
Mm-hmm.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.890
I am kind of worried.
Jess is super emotional,

26:27.890 --> 26:30.023
and you have someone who
literally couldn'’t be----ed

26:30.023 --> 26:31.285
in the slightest.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.679
Like, that'’s just
going to, pew!

26:33.679 --> 26:34.941
Not going to end well.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.464
How dare I?

26:42.470 --> 26:46.517
Oh, my God.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.432
- Where'’s the snail?
- Come here. Can you speak to me?

26:48.432 --> 26:50.043
There'’s not many people that
can speak to you about this.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.653
I feel like you'’re the only one.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.047
Are you really upset about this
or are you just----ing not?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.048
Everyone seems happy about it.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.919
I don'’t understand.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.747
I want her to stay
but at the same time,

26:58.747 --> 26:59.792
I don'’t blame her for going

26:59.792 --> 27:00.836
because the situation she'’s in.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.098
If you were in that situation,

27:02.098 --> 27:03.578
would you not want
to leave as well?

27:15.329 --> 27:16.460
Let'’s get a drink.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.332
My phone'’s dead.
I want a drink.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.644
Double gin and tonic?

27:38.308 --> 27:40.136
Okay, let'’s back
up and go, boat.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.182
Yeah, let'’s go to the boat.

27:46.839 --> 27:49.189
Come on.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.407
Someone needs to
talk to Chef,

27:50.407 --> 27:51.670
and that'’s all I'm going to say.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.106
I don'’t need
to talk to nobody.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.150
Get in the car.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.369
Ow, ow, ow.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.284
Get in the----ing
car, all of you.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.724
You know what I'’m doing
when I get to the boats?

28:02.724 --> 28:03.986
I'’m getting her bag
and I'’m helping her pack.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.814
I don'’t want to be mean.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.903
I personally don'’t want to
ever hear her name around me.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.950
Kyle'’s definitely been just a
- ing mean girl about her.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.473
I feel a little bit awkward,

28:12.473 --> 28:14.605
because I don'’t want to
stand up for her too much,

28:14.605 --> 28:17.696
because then they'’re going
to----ing bite my head off.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.318
Sleep time.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.757
Haleigh.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.063
Jesus.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.847
Oh, it'’s only 1:30.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.370
So sad.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.502
Where'’s Natalya, guys?

28:41.502 --> 28:43.591
I'’m going to check on Natalya.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.594
Let'’s go make
some noodles, bitches.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.728
Mm.

28:57.213 --> 29:00.608
Freedom.
Look at me now.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.566
It'’s a lot with everything.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.220
I can'’t keep up
with this sh--.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.396
At least I'’m not
the center of the drama.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.050
But still, it just hurts me.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.486
I love eating.

29:09.486 --> 29:13.360
Like, when I'’m a bit upset,
you just...

29:13.360 --> 29:16.406
I'’m not used to...
I don'’t eat this much usually,

29:16.406 --> 29:19.627
and now I'’m, like,
stuffing myself.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.720
But if there'’s ugly drama,

29:25.720 --> 29:28.679
then I----ing eat
- ing pasta.

29:28.679 --> 29:31.030
How old is this?
Because I'’ve been eating this,

29:31.030 --> 29:33.336
and I don'’t know if
I'’m going to die tomorrow.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.604
Are you okay?

29:43.129 --> 29:44.783
Okay. Bye.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.092
- Come here.
- Bye.

29:50.092 --> 29:53.139
Okay, so Natalya'’s done.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.923
Can I have----ing
noodles, please?

29:54.923 --> 29:56.925
These are Tumis.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.057
I just want to eat them.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.146
Why is this noodle so good?

30:00.146 --> 30:01.930
Guys, Natalya'’s
leaving tomorrow.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.237
I don'’t want to be a bitch.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.587
So can someone please
help her with her bag?

30:06.587 --> 30:08.067
- I will. I will.
- Luka will.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.068
Will you please do that?

30:09.068 --> 30:10.634
Luka, will you do that?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.114
Maybe.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.333
Okay, she'’s going to do that.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.856
Her bags are right out here.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.162
I just went in there.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.163
Where is she?
Is she sleeping in there?

30:17.163 --> 30:18.512
She'’s sleeping in there.

30:18.512 --> 30:19.948
Do you want me to go in
one more time and say...

30:19.948 --> 30:23.430
No, I don'’t have time
for any of this again.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.998
No, I wasn'’t going to kick off.
If I go in there...

30:25.998 --> 30:27.303
If you go in there...

30:27.303 --> 30:29.828
And she says, no,
I'’m out again.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.831
Hold my breath.
Hold my breath. Hold my breath.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.928
Can I?

30:42.928 --> 30:45.539
No, Kyle.

30:53.677 --> 30:54.983
Can I...

30:54.983 --> 30:57.899
No, Kyle.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.510
I don'’t want to make you worse
than what I want to say.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.338
I don'’t want to speak above you.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.644
It'’s two o'clock in the morning.

31:03.644 --> 31:06.168
I know, but I just
want you to know

31:06.168 --> 31:08.388
it really, really
hurts my heart

31:08.388 --> 31:09.998
this has happened to us
and the things that I said

31:09.998 --> 31:11.347
I want to apologize.

31:11.347 --> 31:12.871
I'’m not going to blame it
on being drunk.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.350
I'’m not going
to blame it on anything.

31:14.350 --> 31:16.526
What I said is what I said.

31:16.526 --> 31:19.486
I want to recover
from anything Kyle.

31:19.486 --> 31:20.487
I'’ll accept his apologies.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.488
Say thank you for coming.

31:21.488 --> 31:22.706
But even that was fake.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.665
I think his true
colors have really shown

31:24.665 --> 31:26.275
and I don'’t want anything
to do with him.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.537
Going on Instagram
and seeing

31:27.537 --> 31:28.930
you'’re no,
no longer my friend,

31:28.930 --> 31:32.542
it'’s like...
this isn'’t just a normal

31:32.542 --> 31:34.327
Natalya and Kyle fight.

31:34.327 --> 31:37.243
This is a
indefinite goodbye.

31:41.203 --> 31:44.424
It'’s just heartbreaking.
That'’s all it is.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.428
If you ever want
to re-chart,

31:48.428 --> 31:49.690
I hope you still have my number.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.345
You know where I am.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.003
- Come with me.
- Kyle.

31:58.003 --> 32:02.616
Come on, Kyle.

32:02.616 --> 32:07.664
All I said is I apologize
for the words that I used,

32:07.664 --> 32:09.623
but I never had forgiveness.

32:09.623 --> 32:10.754
Okay.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.932
She may or may
never reach out to me.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.108
Yes, of course she'’s going.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.283
I wasn'’t there to say stay.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.458
Okay.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.981
I wish her well.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.896
That'’s it.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.419
I think Kyle definitely
thinks he'’s a victim

32:23.419 --> 32:24.855
in all of this

32:24.855 --> 32:26.074
and I think that'’s
a hard pill to swallow.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.641
But whatever it is,

32:27.641 --> 32:29.773
this is her mental health
really being put at play.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.732
Maybe the boat will be better,
maybe it won'’t.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.429
But I think
it'’s best that she leaves.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.866
Okay, well I'’m going
to go pee and go to bed.

32:35.866 --> 32:36.955
Okay, my love.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.652
You can chase us, too,
to my cabin

32:38.652 --> 32:40.262
if you want to feel
more comfortable, but...

32:40.262 --> 32:42.612
No, it'’s funny.

32:42.612 --> 32:43.962
- I love this.
- Oh, it'’s cute.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.615
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.313
Oh, no.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.403
You----ed up.

32:55.843 --> 32:56.975
Ah!

32:56.975 --> 32:58.672
Oh, Tumi.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.805
You'’re going to look so cute.

33:01.805 --> 33:04.852
You'’re going to make
the best babies in the world.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.467
Oh. Oh.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.774
Yes, sweetheart.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.041
Girl.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.738
Good night.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.014
Oh.

34:02.301 --> 34:03.693
<i>Captain Sandina.</i>

34:03.693 --> 34:05.304
<i>Can you please meet
me in the bridge?</i>

34:05.304 --> 34:08.524
<i>Yeah, I'’m coming to the bridge.</i>

34:08.524 --> 34:10.004
My little stomach'’s all curdled.

34:10.004 --> 34:13.051
- Your stomach'’s curdled?
- It'’s been in knots.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.358
Oh, sorry.

34:16.358 --> 34:17.881
Why are we on the bridge?

34:17.881 --> 34:20.710
My issue is, besides the
personal stuff going on at home,

34:20.710 --> 34:23.235
there'’s also been stuff going
on within the interior,

34:23.235 --> 34:24.714
in the crew mess.

34:24.714 --> 34:27.021
Kyle and Max were
having a bit of a fight

34:27.021 --> 34:28.153
in front of everyone.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.372
Max was trying to say,
like, you know,

34:30.372 --> 34:33.506
I support your community
to Kyle.

34:34.550 --> 34:35.986
but I do not accept you saying

34:35.986 --> 34:38.076
that you'’re part of
the LGBTQIA community

34:38.076 --> 34:39.120
because you ain'’t.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.557
But Kyle, I think,
was intoxicated.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.733
I tried to tell Kyle
to calm down.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.518
Kyle, a part of a community

34:45.518 --> 34:47.563
is supposed to be
accepted to every community.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.087
Not you.
Take a back seat.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.958
You don'’t get to tell me
to take a back seat.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.742
I'’m can tell you whatever the
I want to tell you.

34:52.742 --> 34:56.703
He turned around to me
and was just, like,

34:56.703 --> 34:59.445
I'’m a bitch and that I'm...

34:59.445 --> 35:02.056
No one should ever
take advice from me

35:02.056 --> 35:03.753
and I'’m in the most
- ed-up relationship

35:03.753 --> 35:05.233
on anyone on board.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.756
You'’ve been a fake-ass bitch

35:06.756 --> 35:08.410
talking sh-- behind my
back since day one.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.760
Focus of us on your
own----ed-up life

35:10.760 --> 35:12.980
before you----ed up on ours.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.677
See, I thought he'’s one of
my best friends, so...

35:14.677 --> 35:16.070
I'’m sorry.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.593
I want to follow this
because this is serious.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.117
There'’s a lot of stuff.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.206
It'’s him being my
friend, I thought.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.555
I'’ve never said anything,

35:22.555 --> 35:24.034
but, like, I have
Jessika coming to me,

35:24.034 --> 35:26.733
crying because Kyle
came in hot the other day

35:26.733 --> 35:28.126
and screamed at her in a cabin.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.344
Oh, my gosh.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.259
Why would you go to
Tumi behind my back

35:31.259 --> 35:33.783
and tell her that I make
you feel like a green stew?

35:33.783 --> 35:34.784
Throwing me under the bus
like that?

35:34.784 --> 35:36.134
That'’s really hurtful.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.396
That'’s not throwing
you under the bus.

35:37.396 --> 35:38.614
Do you hear the words?

35:38.614 --> 35:40.312
Like, you speak English,
I speak English.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.748
I had faith in----ing you.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.184
I'’m going to speak to Kyle.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.534
That'’s not okay.
That'’s bullying.

35:45.534 --> 35:46.927
I feel the need to get off now.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.320
Like, I just don'’t
feel good in my...

35:48.320 --> 35:49.625
Do you feel safe?

35:49.625 --> 35:50.974
I mean, if I feel safe,
like, I feel safe,

35:50.974 --> 35:53.368
but I just don'’t feel good.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.762
I will never find anyone
who'’s as excellent as you.

35:55.762 --> 35:56.980
That'’s for sure.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.765
- I know that.
- That means a lot.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.636
No, I'’m serious.
This is the truth.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.203
You know, of course
I want you to stay,

36:02.203 --> 36:03.422
but if you want to leave...

36:03.422 --> 36:05.119
I feel so sad leaving.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.777
I know.
Give me a hug.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.476
You know, I can'’t
make Natalya stay,

36:14.476 --> 36:15.912
nor would I.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.437
I want her to feel
supported in her decision.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.787
So, write
what your position was.

36:20.787 --> 36:24.660
Signed off as stew?

36:24.660 --> 36:28.621
- Yes.
- Yes, stew.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.927
But at the same
time, I'’m pissed.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.800
Losing Natalya will be
hard for the interior.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.369
For the next charter,
we'’re in trouble.

36:37.369 --> 36:38.370
Say goodbye to everybody?

36:38.370 --> 36:41.634
Not yet.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.679
I'’m not condoning
Kyle'’s behavior.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.116
Just the way she
described everything.

36:46.116 --> 36:49.032
Kyle'’s bullying.
It is unacceptable.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.090
- Yeah, yeah.
- What'’s happening, brother?

37:03.090 --> 37:05.397
- Good, yeah.
- How are you feeling?

37:05.397 --> 37:07.486
I'’m----ing tired.
I don'’t remember going to bed.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.444
You going now?

37:09.444 --> 37:11.533
Yeah, but don'’t you want
to make your coffee first?

37:11.533 --> 37:15.058
I don'’t know.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.235
I know, man.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.149
I just signed off,
so I'’m officially.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.030
I can'’t believe
she'’s leaving, really.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.032
I'’ve distanced myself
from Natalya,

37:32.032 --> 37:34.034
but we had a really
good relationship.

37:34.034 --> 37:36.558
I think it'’s gonna be amazing
for her to be able to go home,

37:36.558 --> 37:38.604
sort out her stuff,
and kind of...

37:39.822 --> 37:41.868
kind of figure out
what she wants in life.

37:46.612 --> 37:49.049
I'’m very happy with myself
that I, with this season,

37:49.049 --> 37:51.791
I frickin'’ stuck it out for as
long as I possibly could.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.445
I felt like I made some
good friends on this boat,

37:53.445 --> 37:54.924
but at one point I had to say,

37:54.924 --> 37:56.926
sayonara, [bleep] you,
and leave.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.885
Do you want to
help me with my suitcase?

38:01.104 --> 38:03.063
I don'’t know if I want to be
in an open relationship,

38:03.063 --> 38:04.760
and I think I need to have
a hard conversation

38:04.760 --> 38:05.935
with my partner.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.415
All right, text me.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.374
Bye.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.723
See you later.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.072
Luka was very
disappointing at the end.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.161
He should have tried
to encourage me to stay,

38:14.161 --> 38:17.382
but no, he was too focused
on a vagina.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.297
Tell the girls I love them.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.298
- I will.
- Your two girls.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.124
Yeah.

38:21.124 --> 38:22.691
If it wasn'’t for Kyle,

38:22.691 --> 38:24.911
Tumi and I would have had a very
good relationship this season,

38:24.911 --> 38:26.391
but this was the
last straw for me.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.131
I'’m done with Kyle.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.959
He'’ll definitely be getting
blocked on the old Instagram,

38:29.959 --> 38:31.352
and that makes it official.

38:31.352 --> 38:32.571
Let'’s roll.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.442
Good morning, my love.

38:34.442 --> 38:37.140
Someone knock on Kyle'’s door.
This is ridiculous.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.359
Goodbye, boat.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.320
Coming up...

38:42.320 --> 38:47.368
You are the person that'’s
always in the screaming matches.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.544
You want to be Chief Stew.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.417
I would never bring
you back as a chief. Ever.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.940
This is a professional setting.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.290
I don'’t want a person
like you on board.

38:56.290 --> 38:57.422
You understand?

38:57.422 --> 38:58.945
Yes, captain.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.344
Goodbye, boat.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.047
Natalya comes say bye?

39:14.047 --> 39:15.831
Yeah, I helped her
take her bag off.

39:15.831 --> 39:18.660
<i>Jack, Jack, please come
to the bridge.</i>

39:18.660 --> 39:20.401
<i>Copy.</i>

39:20.401 --> 39:23.099
I'’m not sure what happened,
but I'’m not happy about it.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.232
I want to know the full story.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.321
I want to hear
other people'’s feedback.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.410
- Good morning.
- Hey, Jack.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.368
Good.

39:31.456 --> 39:32.935
So what'’s going on?

39:32.935 --> 39:34.850
I don'’t actually remember
what the argument was.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.504
I remember Kyle going
really mad at her,

39:36.504 --> 39:38.071
like, really mad.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.160
And she'’s my friend,
so I kind of stuck up for her.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.118
But it was just
so out of order.

39:43.729 --> 39:44.730
because it all came out
when he was drunk.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.122
Okay.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.171
Natalya'’s the best
stewardess on this boat.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.564
And I think maybe there'’s
a bit of insecurity there

39:52.564 --> 39:53.608
from the others.

39:53.608 --> 39:54.740
They'’ve got what they want now.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.045
I'’m really----ing pissed off.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.700
Thank you.
I hear your frustration.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.788
Yeah, yeah.

39:59.788 --> 40:00.789
And I'’m going to deal with it.

40:00.789 --> 40:01.964
Okay, good.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.227
- Thank you.
- Of course.

40:04.227 --> 40:07.274
Wow, I didn'’t expect that.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.017
How are you?

40:11.017 --> 40:13.280
Natalya left.
I'’m very upset about it.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.281
Mm-mm.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.282
How you doing?

40:15.282 --> 40:16.675
I feel like death right now.

40:16.675 --> 40:20.113
I'’m not sure how sh--
is going to pan out.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.636
I feel so relieved.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.377
Now that Natalya is gone,

40:23.377 --> 40:26.946
but it'’s confusing, like,
what'’s happening right now.

40:26.946 --> 40:29.339
Definitely a little
stressful thinking,

40:29.339 --> 40:31.254
so we'’ll see.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.126
Deck crew, deck crew.
Are we going to do some rinsing?

40:33.126 --> 40:34.301
Roger.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.216
Tumi, Tumi,
please come to the bridge.

40:36.216 --> 40:37.347
<i>Copy.</i>

40:37.347 --> 40:38.784
Okay, you want to get a bucket?
Soap.

40:38.784 --> 40:39.959
We'’re going to wash.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.134
- Hey, good morning.
- Morning.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.309
- How are you?
- Good.

40:42.309 --> 40:43.441
Um...

40:47.053 --> 40:49.316
Remember we talked about
respect in the workplace?

40:49.316 --> 40:50.839
Yeah.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.493
We got to have that.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.494
Yeah.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.583
My issue right now is Kyle.

40:55.583 --> 40:56.628
Okay.

40:56.628 --> 40:57.716
What happened with Max?

40:57.716 --> 40:59.369
He was really heated.

40:59.369 --> 41:01.067
To this day, I'’m like, what
the [bleep] just happened?

41:01.067 --> 41:03.025
And there'’s a girl.
There'’s this.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.679
I'’m like, I still don't
understand the story.

41:04.679 --> 41:07.160
Did you witness him and Natalya?

41:07.160 --> 41:09.379
The situation
caught me off guard.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.556
I'’m not even going to lie.
I was caught off guard.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.296
- Yeah.
- It was heated, but I just...

41:13.296 --> 41:14.950
Because even off the boat,

41:14.950 --> 41:16.604
you'’re still signed
onto the boat.

41:16.604 --> 41:17.605
You still represent the boat.

41:17.605 --> 41:18.824
And I will say this.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.521
As much as I respect him
as a colleague

41:20.521 --> 41:22.001
and I love him
to bits and pieces,

41:22.001 --> 41:24.177
I think the way that he reacts,

41:24.177 --> 41:25.874
especially when he'’s
emotionally triggered,

41:25.874 --> 41:27.354
is incorrect.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.182
So the common
denominator is Kyle.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.314
- Yes.
- In every situation.

41:31.314 --> 41:32.838
- Yes.
- Which is not okay.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.710
- Which isn'’t okay.
- I just want to see Kyle now.

41:35.710 --> 41:36.798
Okay.
Should I get him?

41:36.798 --> 41:37.886
Yes. Thank you.

41:37.886 --> 41:40.672
Of course.

41:40.672 --> 41:43.544
Well, I'’m glad you're
feeling better, mate.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.067
Yeah, bro.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.895
I was worried about
you yesterday.

41:48.244 --> 41:49.245
Yeah.

41:56.905 --> 41:57.863
Okay.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.517
Sh--.

42:05.784 --> 42:06.915
Yeah.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.187
Yeah.

42:18.187 --> 42:20.102
You can'’t live in a casino.

42:24.716 --> 42:26.456
You don'’t think what?

42:28.937 --> 42:30.199
When?

42:35.248 --> 42:36.249
And you'’re going to leave?

42:36.249 --> 42:37.598
- Yeah.
- You reckon?

42:37.598 --> 42:38.730
Yeah.

42:38.730 --> 42:41.907
Nah, you can'’t leave us, mate.

42:41.907 --> 42:44.257
We'’ve only got
four charters to go.

42:44.257 --> 42:45.954
Yeah.

42:47.826 --> 42:49.218
The team was making so
much progression

42:49.218 --> 42:51.612
and we were doing so great.

42:51.612 --> 42:53.309
Yeah, like,
what the [bleep]?

42:53.309 --> 42:54.876
Maybe after this charter,
you change your mind.

42:54.876 --> 42:56.269
We'’ll see.

42:56.269 --> 42:58.576
So...

43:01.361 --> 43:02.754
which the truth
always comes out.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.625
Yeah.

43:04.625 --> 43:05.887
I'’m trying to hide.

43:05.887 --> 43:07.410
Oh, my God, dude.

43:07.410 --> 43:09.935
- Good morning.
- Have a seat.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.545
It'’s not a good morning for me.

43:11.545 --> 43:13.808
Mm-hmm.

43:13.808 --> 43:15.288
Kyle?

43:18.813 --> 43:20.467
I have ears.
I have eyes.

43:20.467 --> 43:24.253
Every situation that'’s
happened on this boat,

43:24.253 --> 43:26.429
guess who'’s the common
denominator?

43:26.429 --> 43:28.301
Your screaming match
with Max.

43:28.301 --> 43:30.303
Your screaming
match with Jess.

43:30.303 --> 43:32.784
And your
screaming match with Natalya.

43:32.784 --> 43:38.485
You are the person that'’s
always in the screaming matches.

43:38.485 --> 43:41.270
What you want to be,
Chief Stew,

43:41.270 --> 43:43.664
I would never bring you
back as a chief ever.

43:43.664 --> 43:45.144
You know why?

43:45.144 --> 43:47.712
Because you can'’t even
control your emotions.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.061
This is a professional setting.

43:49.061 --> 43:50.366
You understand?

43:50.366 --> 43:53.761
You'’re bullying.
You'’re screaming.

43:53.761 --> 43:56.634
I don'’t want a person
like you on board.

43:56.634 --> 43:57.939
You understand?

43:57.939 --> 43:59.114
Yes, Captain.
