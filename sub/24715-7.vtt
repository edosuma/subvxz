00:02.961 --> 00:04.462
Don't make me embarrass you
in front of your kid.

00:04.546 --> 00:07.424
I will not let you turn him into you.

00:07.841 --> 00:11.761
Get used to the idea of morning sickness,
'cause you're pregnant. Congratulations.

00:11.928 --> 00:14.180
There is a mass.
There is a chance it's malignant.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.682
We'll probably have to do a biopsy.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.517
CONNIE: How about you just tell me
what's going on?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.686
-It's got nothing to do with you.
-Yeah, it does.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.354
'Cause it's getting between me and Andy.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.274
We're gonna go down to the Time Bar,
show the DOA's picture around.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.110
Just so you know, the owner,
James Carlin, real pain in the ass.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.070
Folks are being preyed on
out of your bars.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.155
The public's gotta know.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.823
Blue and white cord around her neck.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.033
We already knew they were connected.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.493

They're pushing for a task force.

Hey. Lucy Werner.
She got jumped getting on the elevator.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.428
It happen in here?

00:53.678 --> 00:56.639
Time Bar matchbook was down the stairs,
about half a flight.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.224
(EXHALES) And the blue and white rope?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.768
(EXHALES) In the trash can
on the ground floor.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.853
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-She get a look at this guy?

01:02.353 --> 01:04.105
Haven't talked to her yet.
Where's Andy and Connie?

01:04.189 --> 01:06.900
CLARK: Uh. They're running late.
I don't know. She's still fighting a bug.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.653
Excuse us. Hey.
Detectives Russell, Clark, and Ortiz.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.239
-Can you tell us what happened, Lucy?
-(BREATHES SHAKILY) Um...

01:13.406 --> 01:17.077
(SOBS) I was getting on the elevator.
He hit me on the back of the head.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.453
Did you see the man's face?

01:18.828 --> 01:20.497
(INHALES) He hit me from behind.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.625
-After he hit you, what happened?
-(SOBS) He dragged me to the stairwell.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.877
Did you get a better look at him
at that point?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.045
(SOBS) No.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.422
Lucy, any description you can give us
would be very helpful.

01:29.547 --> 01:30.632
Um...

01:30.715 --> 01:33.343
(LIPS SMACKING) I remember hitting him.
(SNIFFLES) Um. Punching him.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.011
(SOBS) I think he was white.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.805
Do you remember how tall he was?

01:37.597 --> 01:38.848
LUCY: No. (SOBBING)

01:38.932 --> 01:41.392
Did you, uh, hear his voice?
Did he say anything to you?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.144
(SOBS) Oh, there was someone else.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.647
-There was another man?
-Standing in the doorway.

01:46.189 --> 01:50.777
Oh, he said, "Go, run.
There's someone coming," and...

01:50.860 --> 01:54.447
and the man who was attacking me
let me go. (SOBS)

01:54.572 --> 01:56.574
And they both ran up the stairs.

01:56.825 --> 02:02.288
Um. The last thing I heard was, um,
"Jimmy is gonna be pissed."

02:02.664 --> 02:05.583
-Do you know anyone named Jimmy?
-No. (EXHALES)

02:06.084 --> 02:07.961
Lucy, have you ever been in the Time Bar?

02:09.587 --> 02:11.381
I stopped in there the other day.

02:11.589 --> 02:15.135
-You talk to anybody?
-No. I just went in to look.

-They were gonna kill me.
-TONY: John!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.482
We're gonna have the paramedics
take you to the hospital

02:29.566 --> 02:31.317

What do we got?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.327
The matchbook was planted.
There was an accomplice.

02:41.452 --> 02:44.581
-Did she see faces?
-The attacker might have been white.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.250
One of the attackers
said the name "Jimmy."

02:47.584 --> 02:49.961
There's no Jimmys' or James in this case
except for James Carlin

02:50.044 --> 02:52.130
-who owns the Time Bar.
-So, Carlin's involved.

Anything on the canvass?
The boss could use some good news.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.265
Nothing. No one saw the perps.

I don't want names.
I don't know. I don't care.

No, we're with the 15th squad.
Wha... what happened here, Lyle?

04:51.124 --> 04:54.252
Uh. The gun just went off.
Um. He died right in front of me.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.879
Uh. Let's take it from the top.
What brought you here?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.256
I'm waitin' on my informant.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.717
The guy comes up on me,
pulls a piece, asks for my wallet.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.552
Looks like you didn't comply.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.721
Well, I figure he robs me,
then puts one in my head,

05:04.804 --> 05:08.057
so I grabbed for his gun
and... and a round went off.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.602
I tried to stop the bleeding, but I...

05:12.186 --> 05:13.479
I must have hit him in an artery.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.566
Look, I know what you're going through.
It's gonna be okay.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.860

05:30.413 --> 05:33.666

or forgot about the meet.

-You got a name for us?
-A nickname we use is "Flossy."

but we gotta ask the question.

something like this?

ask him about the brother
that he threatened to kill

07:44.839 --> 07:47.049
or the mother
that he hasn't talked to in 20 years.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.074
and I'm going in for the biopsy right now.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.119
I was wondering
if you could help me through it.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.288
Sure.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.333
(EXHALES)

11:11.170 --> 11:12.505
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:15.883 --> 11:19.720
Something's come up
that we're, uh, hoping to clarify.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.974
It seems the DOA has a sheet
for armed robberies.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.601
Uh. No shocker there.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.897
But, uh, it turns out, Lyle,
where this took place,

11:29.980 --> 11:32.191
the... the neighborhood
has a gay element to it.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.609
Oh.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.239
Oh, come on.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.782
Who... who picked
the location for the meet?

11:39.865 --> 11:43.244
Flossy did, which is no surprise,
'cause the guy's half a fag himself.

11:43.494 --> 11:47.123
Used to, uh, sell meth on 46th street
where all the male pros hang out.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.750
-Well, your CO hooked us up with Flossy.
-Fine.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.877
Flossy's saying
there was no meet scheduled.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.840
-You guys work with informants at all?
-Yeah, we do.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.926
Okay. So then I don't need to get
into how they're a little

11:59.093 --> 12:00.261
slippery sometimes.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.055
Well, Flossy was pretty emphatic
about there being no meeting.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.642
-There's no reason why he'd lie about it.
-Unless you know something we don't.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.354
Flossy was either high, scared,

12:10.813 --> 12:13.691
checking you out, forgot about it,
pissed at me for having him brought in,

12:13.774 --> 12:16.068
or any of ten other reasons why he'd lie.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.571
(INHALES) There was a meet scheduled.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.324
I showed. Next thing,
some scumbag's shoving a gun in my face.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.368
-All right, then.
-We done?

12:24.493 --> 12:26.412
(INHALES) It's been a long morning.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.082
We'll be in touch.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.469
Could I ask a hypothetical question?

12:42.219 --> 12:44.430
If it is malignant,
could it be removed with a lumpectomy

12:44.513 --> 12:45.556
or would I need the breast removed?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.058
Diane, I... I think you're jumping a step.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.227
There's a 20 percent chance of malignancy.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.813
Meaning an 80 percent chance it's benign.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.859
For someone with my breast size,
would I need a mastectomy?

12:57.485 --> 12:58.486
You might.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.613
That's all I wanted to know.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.990
(INHALES) Uh. I'd like
to run a number by you.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.867
Does it have to do with survival rates?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.495
Uh. For women my age
with a fast growth malignancy,

13:07.578 --> 13:09.371
the numbers aren't good,
no matter how you cut it. Am I right?

13:09.455 --> 13:12.249
Diane, stop. Take her hand.

13:14.418 --> 13:19.715
The upside to research is being prepared.
The downside is being over-prepared.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.258
I'm facing facts.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.718
DR. HELEN:
You're drowning yourself in them.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.930
If there comes a time
for a conversation about statistics,

13:26.013 --> 13:27.640
I promise I'll be open and frank.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.851
But right now,
all we're doing is running a small test

13:30.935 --> 13:32.102
that won't hurt a bit.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.480
-That's where we're at.
-(INHALES)

13:35.064 --> 13:37.566
-Okay. (SIGHS)
-Ready when you are.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.740
(SIGHS)

14:14.228 --> 14:15.479
(EXHALES)

14:16.313 --> 14:17.439
(GROANS)

14:32.162 --> 14:35.708
-Appreciate you coming in, Mr. Galanter.
-ADAM: Anything to help. (EXHALES)

14:35.875 --> 14:38.168
ANDY: Tell us about your relationship
with James Carlin.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.462
-We'll need about a month.
-Yeah, we've met him.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.464
ADAM: We don't get along,
but that's not a prerequisite

14:42.548 --> 14:44.884
-for making money.
-And the money side, that's you?

14:45.009 --> 14:47.553
(INHALES) I handle the funding,
Jimmy's about design and publicity,

14:47.636 --> 14:48.637
the glitter side of it.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.764
We understand you two
were in court recently.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.725
He's been trying to muscle me
out of board meetings.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.393
And I think taking money that's not his.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.146
If James Carlin were thrown in jail,
how would that affect you?

14:58.188 --> 15:00.316
I'd run the Board of the corporation.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.318
That appeal to you?

15:03.652 --> 15:06.280
Why does it feel like it got
about eight degrees colder in here?

15:06.363 --> 15:08.490
(INHALES) We're looking down
a lot of avenues,

15:08.574 --> 15:11.535
and the animosity between you
and Carlin is one of them.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.912
As a motive for these killings?

15:13.203 --> 15:16.749
Yeah. When business relationships go sour
and there's a lot of money at stake,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.251
sometimes people resort to crazy things.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.087
-Did you just accuse me?
-We're just talking, Mr. Galanter.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.672
All due respect,
you're talking out of your ass.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.466
-Watch your tongue.
-Jimmy Carlin's been trying

15:25.549 --> 15:27.927
to dirty trick me out of the corporation
for the last two years.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.179
-If you're accusing anyone, talk to him!
-JOHN: What kind of dirty tricks?

15:30.638 --> 15:33.432
He bribed an employee into filing
a sexual harassment suit against me.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.600
Where'd it end up?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.185
We got to the girl,
and the suit was dropped.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.978
So it's back to normal for you and Carlin?

15:38.062 --> 15:39.063
We patched things up.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.483
Then a year ago,
I show up for a board meeting,

15:42.691 --> 15:45.069
and his ape tried
to physically keep me out of the room.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.362
He took a swing at me.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.822
I had to get a court order,
so I could come to work.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.326
-This is Carlin's bodyguard?
-Yeah. Brian Vaughn.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.205
Jimmy wants me out
so he can consolidate the company,

15:56.288 --> 15:58.248
but I won't sell at his price.
You see where I'm going?

15:58.374 --> 15:59.500
Not quite.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.043
Because of these murders... (INHALES)

16:01.293 --> 16:03.212
...the value
of the Helix Hotel is tanking.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.048
(INHALES) Maybe Jimmy thinks
that will drive my price down.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.676
Look at who's benefiting.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.679
Not me.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.100
-Who do we believe?
-The cop.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.686
Yeah. The informant, boss, this Flossy,

16:18.769 --> 16:22.523
-he's about as reliable as my old triumph.
-Hey, we're just waiting on ballistics.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.567
If the slug matches the DOA's gun,
I think we're in business.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.944
Detective Jones?

16:27.069 --> 16:30.114
It's, uh, Michael Woodruff's
foster mother, GerI Gross on line one.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.075
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-What have you guys been up to?

16:33.242 --> 16:35.536
-DIANE: Oh, we, uh...
-CONNIE: Went, uh, to re-canvass.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.913
-Came up empty.
-Okay.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.542
-(BALDWIN EXHALES)
-Everything all right?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.044
(SIGHS) Michael didn't show up
for school today,

16:44.128 --> 16:45.421
and nobody knows where he is.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.965
Oh. Kids that age,
they play hooky all the time.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.133
BALDWIN: No, this one doesn't.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.093
Not after what it took
to get him into that foster home.

16:52.928 --> 16:56.140
-TONY: What'd the business partner say?
-That Carlin's broke and desperate.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.349
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

16:57.433 --> 17:01.311
Okay, I went to P.S. 173,
so, uh, you need to explain something.

17:01.895 --> 17:05.315
Why would Carlin be behind these murders
and ruin his own business?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.276
He's trying to buy
his business partner out,

17:07.401 --> 17:11.947
so, maybe he stages the murders,
sinks the hotels, then gets them back

17:12.031 --> 17:14.116
-at pennies on the dollar.
-That's pretty elaborate.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.327
Well, these are the most egotistical
assholes I ever met in my life.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.787
This is not past them.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.081
Anything on Carlin's finances?

17:21.331 --> 17:24.126
Valerie says she'll issue a subpoena
for relevant books and records,

17:24.209 --> 17:26.462
-but she wants more first.
-So do I.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.757
Carlin's got a bodyguard.
We'll bring him in, see what shakes out.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.050
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

17:31.300 --> 17:34.428
-May I help you?
-Yeah, I'm looking for them two.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.597
What do you need, Flossy?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.599
(CLEARS THROAT) All right,
now don't kill me,

17:38.766 --> 17:40.934
but I, uh, lied a little earlier.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.104
There was a meet with... (INHALES)
...Detective Trotter.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.857
-And my bad for spacing it.
-BALDWIN: Oh, yeah, that sounds legit.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.233
-(EXHALES)
-In there.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.280
If I hear from Michael, I'll let you know.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.454
-You okay?
-Yeah. Thanks.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.211
I was supposed to hook up
with Lyle this morning, but I overslept.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.587
Why'd you shine us on?

18:09.129 --> 18:13.717
Oh. Two cops I don't know haul me in,
start asking about a meet I blew off?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.053
-So, I figured I was in trouble.
-Yeah, huh?

18:16.386 --> 18:17.888
And then you said Lyle got robbed.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.389
So, uh, why are you here now?

18:19.723 --> 18:22.935
-Jiminy Cricket pay you a visit?
-No, I scoped you two out.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.771
Word is you're cool,
so I figured I'd set the record straight.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.815
Never know
when we might do business, right?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.442
So Lyle calls and told you to come in
with a new story?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.736
No, no. Man, I would never do that.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.155
But you see, you and Lyle screwed up.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.784
'Cause this whole thing was sealed off,
and now we're looking at everybody,

18:38.992 --> 18:40.452
including your skanky ass.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.287
I ain't do nothing but lie earlier.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.082
No, you told the truth earlier.
You're lying now!

18:45.833 --> 18:47.668
Can I just split,
and we pretend like this never happen...

18:47.751 --> 18:50.295
-What's Lyle covering up?
-Nothing, man.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.881
-Does he know the guy he shot?
-I don't know!

18:53.006 --> 18:55.509
What did you say when he called
or do you wanna go flying out the window?

18:58.178 --> 18:59.805
He didn't call me, his partner did.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.642
Detective Charlie Givens. Black dude.

19:04.017 --> 19:07.354
All he said was to come back in
and say there was a meet,

19:07.437 --> 19:08.438
and that's all I did.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.984
'Cause I work for him, right?
If I don't do it, they say I'm outdoors.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.610
That better be the extent of it.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.780
Swear on my children, all right?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.783
We're gonna keep you downstairs
for a while, Flossy,

19:19.867 --> 19:21.243
till we figure this out.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.289
Oh, look. If Lyle and Charlie
go down for something, I'm available,

19:25.372 --> 19:28.709
so keep it in mind 'cause I'm...
I'm like the pizza man, I deliver.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.922
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

19:34.214 --> 19:35.215
Sit down.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.886
So... (SIGHS) ...how long you been working
for James Carlin?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.012
About four years.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.847
Must be pretty good at driving him around.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.349
-Little more to it than that.
-DIANE: Yeah? Like what?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.894
Things. I'm just saying
I ain't a chauffeur.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.062
So, you get hookers for him,
finish his fights.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.939
I'm a trained security professional.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.692
What about that assault collar
you did time for?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.194
Misunderstanding.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.197
Or that order of protection that, uh,
Mr. Galanter's got against you.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.656
That must be a misunderstanding too.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.159
(SCOFFS) Galanter's a liar.
I never touched him.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.454
All right, listen, Brian,
having done some bodyguard work myself,

20:05.787 --> 20:07.581
I know you're paid
to keep your mouth shut.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.833
And that's fine out there in Clubland,
but you're in the middle

20:09.917 --> 20:11.543
of a police investigation.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.047
-You mean this serial killer thing?
-That's right.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.549
-What, now you're looking at me?
-Where were you this morning?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.345
-Oh, you guys are getting desperate.
-Where were you?

20:21.470 --> 20:24.848
-(CHUCKLES) You are as bad as Jimmy said.
-ANDY: We're not gonna ask you again.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.935
Yeah, I'm a serial killer,
and I eat their flesh

20:28.018 --> 20:30.062
and make lampshades
out of their skin. (CHUCKLES)

20:30.520 --> 20:32.689
We've been taking bullshit
off your boss for weeks straight.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.149
Now, we ain't gonna be taking it from you.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.401
So, laugh one more time,
I'll knock your teeth out.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.154
I got to work at 8:00, been there since.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.698
All right, we've got reason to believe
whoever's doing these murders

20:41.782 --> 20:43.033
has been working for Carlin.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.118
I don't know anything about those murders.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.495
That's straight up.

20:48.997 --> 20:51.250
You go tell your boss
how we're gonna be looking

20:51.333 --> 20:53.460
into both of you inside and out.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.963

everybody you ever met.

-JOHN: That should be good

20:57.673 --> 20:58.924
for a laugh, huh, dickhead?

20:59.299 --> 21:00.300

21:03.428 --> 21:04.763
-(SIGHS)
-(DOOR OPENING)

21:05.639 --> 21:07.015

21:07.975 --> 21:09.017
I know.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.853
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:12.729 --> 21:16.024
-Where's Lyle's partner now?
-Out on a buy and bust operation.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.734
Uh. They're trying to get in touch
with his field team

-and get him off the street.
-Hey, no more wiggle room on this.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.531
One more hiccup,
hand it over to internal affairs.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.242
IRVIN: 15th squad. Oh, hold on.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.327
Uh. Detective Jones? Michael Woodruff.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.248
-We kicked this Vaughn.
-TONY: Nothing out of him?

21:31.665 --> 21:33.417
DIANE: A lot of attitude,
but nothing to hold him.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.043
RITA: Well, I've been looking into Vaughn.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.838
-He's got an alias. Robert Glover.
-Oh. Where'd that name come up?

21:38.046 --> 21:40.132
He tried to use it applying
for a gun permit four months ago.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.259
You want me to get him back in?
He can't have gotten far.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.845
Where's your assault victim
from this morning, Lucy Werner?

21:45.012 --> 21:46.096
Finishing up at Bellevue.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.932
All right, get her in,
show her a photo array with Vaughn in it.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.809
If she picks him out,
then we'll snatch him up.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.979
And make sure we know
where James Carlin is at all times.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.904

Hey, Michael.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.430
-I told you not to worry.
-Yeah. You're supposed to be in school.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.433
I'm just cutting this one day. But...

22:31.516 --> 22:33.685
All right. We'll talk about it later,
all right? My car is outside.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.020
I'll meet you there in a sec.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.941
Yeah. Your dad's coming too.
We're all gonna have a conversation.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.027
-Now, let's go.
-Hold up, hold up.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.653
Just dawned on me.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.864
Know who you remind me of?

22:46.615 --> 22:51.995
What was that show about the black butler,
worked with them white folks, uh...

22:53.413 --> 22:54.456
"Benson."

22:55.457 --> 22:57.376
Yeah. Benson.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.002
Go get in the car, Michael.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.670
CRAIG: Oh, see,
now you're taking it wrong.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.174
It's a compliment.
(INHALES) Michael, this Benson cat, uh...

23:04.591 --> 23:08.345

It's okay, son. We'll meet you out there.

-No, you're going in a squad car.
-Suits me fine.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.691
-Used to riding in the back seat.
-Hmm.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.529
You know, you and I just might bump
into each other on the street one day.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.490
-Wouldn't that be nice?
-Move your ass.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.802
You know the strings I had to pull
to get your situation right?

23:49.344 --> 23:51.596
I mean, most kids your age,
they never make it out of a group home.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.723
I took a day off, man.
What's the big deal?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.434
What you did today was wrong, Michael.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.562
-You know it, and you can't do it again.
-All right, man!

Look, I'm not trying to shove
nothing down your throat.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.815
-If you don't want my help...
-I do.

24:02.524 --> 24:06.319
But I ain't perfect, okay?
It's like you expect me to be perfect.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.489
I've been going to school.
I've been getting my grades.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.367
I've been staying out of trouble.
But that ain't good enough?

24:12.742 --> 24:14.369
I just don't want you to start slipping.

You don't want me around my dad.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.130
If one of your rules
is I can't see my dad no more,

24:25.589 --> 24:28.383
then screw it.
You go your way, I'll go mine.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.472
He might have been the one
who attacked me.

25:15.555 --> 25:19.226
Uh. In order for the identification
to stand up legally,

25:19.309 --> 25:20.769
we really need you to be certain.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.522

a good enough look. I'm sorry.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.655
I'll get a female officer
to take you home.

Could she stay with me just a few minutes
when I get there till I'm settled?

Of course. Yeah.

What do you plan on doing
with Michael's dad?

after I talk to the partner.

-Why?
-GREG: Did you tell him to, uh,

26:17.742 --> 26:20.036
change his story to us
and back your partner Lyle

26:20.120 --> 26:22.038
on them having a meet
scheduled this morning?

-Hey. Where is this coming from?
-Flossy.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.587
-Are you covering something up?
-No.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.839
-Is your partner a liar?
-He's clean.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.299
Then, why is he lying to us,

26:32.674 --> 26:34.884
and why are you dancing around
all our questions?

26:34.968 --> 26:37.429
You see, the shadier the people involved
in this shooting act,

26:37.887 --> 26:39.139
the dirtier the shooting looks.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.434
-Is that what you're trying to get across?
-This is a good guy.

26:43.935 --> 26:48.690
-A good cop. I want to say that up front.
-Charlie, what's going on?

26:48.940 --> 26:50.233
(EXHALES)

26:53.028 --> 26:56.156
Just after Lyle and me partnered up,
we were working the Halloween parade,

26:56.239 --> 26:58.116
and we collared this queen selling dope.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.621
The queen recognizes Lyle,
asks why Lyle hasn't called him.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.373
-So Lyle's gay?
-But he don't admit it.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.792
And... and we don't talk about it.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.295
And after watching the guy
make collar after collar,

27:10.378 --> 27:11.421
it don't enter into the work.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.423
So what got you calling Flossy?

27:13.840 --> 27:15.925
After talking to you,
Flossy tracked me down,

27:16.009 --> 27:17.510
pissed off that he got hauled in.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.596
Now, when I heard
where the shooting went down,

27:19.679 --> 27:21.473
I knew what the deal was,
I... I... I just knew.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.267
(INHALES) So, I told Flossy
to come back to you,

27:24.976 --> 27:26.811
reverse what he said and back up Lyle.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.272

And you thought we'd just buy it?

27:29.439 --> 27:30.774
I don't know. I...

27:31.358 --> 27:32.609
I mean, we're all cops. What...

27:34.361 --> 27:35.904
I guess I didn't think it out so well.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.365
Were you conferring at all
with Lyle on what you did?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.742
He's been at psych services
in Queens all day.

27:40.825 --> 27:41.826
I haven't spoken to him.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.037

out of the goodness of your heart?

to protect the guy. Uh. I just...

hoping he doesn't get burned.

show up at your arraignment,

you're on your own.

doing your job.

31:06.614 --> 31:09.492
"Hey, you milk that fool
for all he's worth."

31:10.743 --> 31:12.787
Looks like he's been
doing a good job of it.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.293
You know, I came here
to work it out man to man.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.379

you can't do it that way, fine.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.047

All right, let's make it quick.
Purpose of this meeting?

31:55.413 --> 31:57.248
Filling in some holes in our information.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.501
We're gonna talk to you
about your business partner,

32:00.585 --> 32:02.879
Adam Galanter,
and the sex harassment lawsuit

32:02.962 --> 32:04.631

32:05.048 --> 32:06.090
-Where's this going?
-(DIANE INHALING)

32:06.299 --> 32:09.260
There's a history of illegal activity
by Carlin against Galanter.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.387
-JIMMY: Please.
-He's not here to confess to anything,

32:11.471 --> 32:12.889
and I wouldn't let him if he tried.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.974
You have specific questions?
Let's hear them.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.310
We know you're trying
to muscle Galanter out of the business...

32:17.435 --> 32:18.561
-Oh.
-ANDY: ...and how low you'll stoop

32:18.645 --> 32:20.438
-to do it.
-All right, is he under arrest?

32:20.730 --> 32:23.274
Look, if he doesn't have the patience
for this little discussion,

32:23.483 --> 32:25.944
we'll get a search warrant
for the lockbox under his desk,

32:26.027 --> 32:27.695
and he'll be a collar for coke possession.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.114
-You complete assholes.
-Relax, Jimmy.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.618
Oh, you... you can't find your ass,
so I'm busted for an eight ball?

32:33.701 --> 32:36.204
Explain your past behavior.
You won't be busted for anything.

-No. You listen up...
-ARRASCADA: Hey, Jimmy...

32:37.622 --> 32:40.667
No, shut up, John.
Look, these girls dying is on you.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.418
So is my place being abandoned.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.380
You got concrete in your skulls,
and you're no good at your job.

32:45.588 --> 32:49.634
We'd be doing a hell of a lot better at it
if you would quit whining like an old lady

32:49.717 --> 32:52.011
and let us rule you out,
instead of stonewalling

32:52.095 --> 32:53.346
and wasting another day!

-I don't know what you're talking about.
-All right. We're past that now.

And we spoke to your partner,
and he admitted he leaned on Flossy

you came up with that on the fly?

(INHALES)
So the shooting went down like he said?

35:54.235 --> 35:55.486
And it looks like the only thing
he lied about

35:55.570 --> 35:57.113
was what got him in the parking structure.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.157
We got anything to confirm it? No witness?

35:59.240 --> 36:03.536
No witnesses, but, uh, we dug further
into the DOA's arrest reports.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.622
Uh. All three of his priors
were for ripping off gay guys out of bars.

And we got ballistics back
on the slug from the DOA.

some allowances could be made.

wasted my detectives' day,

37:04.138 --> 37:05.431
And I stand up for them.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.600
So that means that the...

37:08.059 --> 37:10.269
private component
in this case stays private?

37:10.353 --> 37:12.355
It means that the files
aren't gonna reflect
