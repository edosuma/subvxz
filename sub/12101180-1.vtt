00:16.182 --> 00:19.753
(bright electronic music)

00:29.195 --> 00:31.231
- [Psychologist] I
truly look at it as,

00:32.966 --> 00:34.634
I'm not fucked up, the world is.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.705
People are flawed, people
are incredibly flawed,

00:38.705 --> 00:40.573
and that fucking bothers me.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.342
I hate it, it drives me crazy.

00:43.743 --> 00:47.614
- Is that what's drawn you to
wanna psychoanalyze everyone?

00:47.614 --> 00:50.417
- [Psychologist] Yeah, I wanna
know what their problem is.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.552
The reason I bring
this up is because,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.287
every situation that I'm in,

00:54.287 --> 00:57.257
when I feel like people
are doing the wrong thing,

00:57.257 --> 00:59.459
I feel like it's clear as day

00:59.459 --> 01:01.261
that they're doing
the wrong thing.

01:02.695 --> 01:05.965
Most people are in the dark
about everything, you know?

01:05.965 --> 01:07.067
They're just going,

01:08.435 --> 01:10.770
they're just going by impulse
like, okay, what's today?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.339
What do I gotta do today-
- Why do you think

01:13.339 --> 01:14.641
people don't think
for themselves,

01:14.641 --> 01:16.042
if there is a choice?
- 'Cause it's easier.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.344
It's easier, because
it's like you can

01:18.344 --> 01:19.813
just fucking sit there.
- But, you think that

01:19.813 --> 01:21.748
they realize that, that
they know that it's easier?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.383
- [Psychologist] No.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.453
- What is it, what
are you trying to
understand with people?

01:28.788 --> 01:31.891
With women, in particular,
like your patients?

01:33.226 --> 01:37.597
- [Psychologist] I wanna know
why they do what they do.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.799
I wanna know why they
think how they think.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.171
More of a guide, I'd
rather be a guide like,

01:45.171 --> 01:48.775
hey, listen, if you go down
that road, it's no good,

01:48.775 --> 01:49.976
you have to go this way.

01:49.976 --> 01:51.177
Oh, good, thank you,
I appreciate it.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.046
And then, you go
on their merry way,

01:53.046 --> 01:54.948
and then they're on the
good road, that's all.

01:55.815 --> 01:57.050
You're here early today.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.320
Why so early?

02:03.022 --> 02:06.526
- I'm never on time,
so I left early,

02:06.526 --> 02:10.563
and I actually got here
early, I don't know.

02:10.563 --> 02:12.298
- [Psychologist] You have
nothing better to do?

02:17.370 --> 02:19.672
- I had things I
could do, I just...

02:21.007 --> 02:22.408
- [Psychologist] Well,
there's gotta be a reason

02:22.408 --> 02:24.477
you wanted to be here so
early, is everything all right?

02:26.479 --> 02:27.380
- Yeah.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.583
- [Psychologist] You hesitated.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.087
Is everything really all right?

02:36.289 --> 02:37.357
- Can I put my feet up?

02:37.357 --> 02:38.324
- [Psychologist] Sure.

02:39.626 --> 02:42.228
- I just, feel more
comfortable like this (sighs).

02:45.532 --> 02:49.002
- [Psychologist] I don't
even know if me doing this,

02:49.002 --> 02:51.938
is any kind of reflection of me.

02:51.938 --> 02:57.010
I think I'm just doing it,
because people fascinate me.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.212
- You're drawn to it.

02:59.212 --> 03:03.183
- [Psychologist] I wanna help
people with what I've learned.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.417
- Yeah.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.718
- [Psychologist] Are
you happy in your life?

03:05.718 --> 03:07.287
- Most of the time.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.855
- [Psychologist] What do you
want, what are you missing?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.057
If you could have one thing
in your life that's missing,

03:11.057 --> 03:12.325
what would it be?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.566
- I want a boyfriend.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.934
- [Psychologist] You
want a boyfriend?

03:22.702 --> 03:25.572
And so, how come you don't
have a boyfriend already?

03:30.677 --> 03:33.846
- I don't know the relationships
I have don't stick.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.248
- [Psychologist] Why not?

03:35.248 --> 03:38.751
- 'Cause, I fucking love
assholes and they're all dicks.

03:38.751 --> 03:39.752
- Are they dicks?

03:40.520 --> 03:41.654
- No, they're dicks.
- Or, maybe you're

03:41.654 --> 03:42.622
doing something wrong?

03:45.291 --> 03:47.994
- Nothing, I'm not doing
anything that wrong.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.896
- [Psychologist] Why
do you love assholes?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.932
- I don't know, they're sexier.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.467
- [Psychologist] Sexier.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.036
- Definitely, your purpose is
to try and help other people,

03:58.104 --> 03:59.672
which is amazing,
like you're a teacher.

03:59.672 --> 04:02.775
That's probably part of
your like, whole fate,

04:02.775 --> 04:05.111
but another, also
could be during this,

04:05.111 --> 04:07.580
there's always gonna
be something that

04:07.580 --> 04:10.783
you're gonna learn for yourself
that's very personal to you,

04:10.783 --> 04:12.619
to your own evolution.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.187
- I remember messaging my mom

04:14.187 --> 04:16.556
and she didn't answer
me for three years.

04:16.556 --> 04:19.192
Until I called her one
day and I was like, bitch,

04:19.192 --> 04:20.393
and I hung it up.

04:20.393 --> 04:23.196
I got a phone call
so fast, three years.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.697
I'm taking about birthdays,
I'm talking about everything,

04:24.697 --> 04:27.700
and it took me to say, bitch,
to get my mom to hit me up.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.601
My pops called me like,

04:28.601 --> 04:30.136
oh, you don't have to
call your mom a bitch.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.404
I'm like, hold on, man,
I don't give a fuck,

04:31.404 --> 04:32.905
you had a mom, you don't get it.

04:32.905 --> 04:36.175
- I don't, I don't even know
if I should be here, honestly.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.279
- [Psychologist] That's
what everybody says.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.047
- Well, I mean it.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.448
- [Psychologist] So, the
nice guy that every girl-

04:42.448 --> 04:45.151
- I can't fucking
stand nice guys.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.787
- You don't like nice-
- They're like, you know?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.155
Fucking annoying.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.089
- [Psychologist] Why is that?

04:50.089 --> 04:51.557
- 'Cause, they're pussies,

04:51.557 --> 04:52.759
they don't stand
up for themselves.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.427
They just let me
walk all over them.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.031
- [Psychologist] Right, I agree,

04:59.332 --> 05:00.933
'cause you don't respect
them, that's why.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.402
- They don't respect themselves.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.037
- [Psychologist] They
don't respect themselves.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.605
That's right, and you
can't respect somebody

05:05.605 --> 05:07.173
who doesn't respect them-
- No.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.475
- [Psychologist] So, do
you respect yourself?

05:13.379 --> 05:14.314
- Yeah.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.114
- [Psychologist] You sure?

05:15.114 --> 05:16.015
- No.

05:16.015 --> 05:16.849
- You're a man,

05:16.849 --> 05:17.984
so I don't know if
you're the right person

05:17.984 --> 05:19.218
I should be talking to.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.753
- [Psychologist] That
sounds a bit sexist, no?

05:21.621 --> 05:22.522
- Well,

05:23.856 --> 05:27.894
talking to a man about men,
seems like it wouldn't,

05:29.095 --> 05:31.297
really work out, but
I will give it a try.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.000
- [Psychologist] You're
here, because of men?

05:34.801 --> 05:36.536
- I am here,
because of men, yes.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.837
- [Psychologist] Why
is it okay for women

05:37.837 --> 05:40.006
to be sexist against men?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.775
Why is okay for women
to label themselves,

05:42.775 --> 05:44.811
as a woman, blah, blah,
blah, and therefore,

05:44.811 --> 05:46.846
I have to think this,
this, this, this, and this,

05:46.846 --> 05:48.081
you know what I'm saying?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.315
- Yeah, I'm with
you, I'm with you.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.950
I think, and I get
it, like I say,

05:50.950 --> 05:52.819
I always have to play both
sides, I have to be fair.

05:52.819 --> 05:53.986
If I was a woman, I would say,

05:53.986 --> 05:56.656
all this time they
never got anything fair.

05:56.656 --> 05:57.890
Nothing was ever was ever fair-

05:57.890 --> 06:00.259
- [Psychologist] Right,
but is that the case?

06:00.259 --> 06:01.494
Well, maybe these guys,

06:01.494 --> 06:03.196
these assholes guys
who don't respect you,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.732
maybe you're that
nice guy to them.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.268
- Aren't I supposed
to figure that out,

06:09.268 --> 06:12.305
without you telling me?
(Psychologist chuckling)

06:12.305 --> 06:14.173
- [Psychologist] Well, hey,
that's what I'm here for, right?

06:14.173 --> 06:15.341
To help you along.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.846
(Victoria sighs)

06:19.846 --> 06:20.847
Do you think or no?

06:21.981 --> 06:23.783
- It sounds like
it could be right.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.486
- [Psychologist] I think that

06:26.486 --> 06:28.688
in order to become
better as a person,

06:28.688 --> 06:31.023
you have to know the truth
about who you are like,

06:31.023 --> 06:34.594
duh, how are you gonna
fucking fix the sink?

06:34.594 --> 06:37.296
If you don't know
what's clogging it,

06:37.296 --> 06:38.131
you know what I'm saying?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.565
You need to know shit.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.234
- I know, I know.
- It's why people,

06:41.234 --> 06:43.636
they don't like that,
they wanna live in denial.

06:43.636 --> 06:44.837
- Yeah.
- They want excuses

06:44.837 --> 06:46.672
for their behavior
instead of being like,

06:46.672 --> 06:48.408
hey, you really
shouldn't be like that.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.675
- Right.

06:49.675 --> 06:50.610
- [Psychologist] Do
you think that maybe

06:50.610 --> 06:51.811
you feel bad about yourself?

06:51.811 --> 06:53.613
So, you like, when
guys treat you badly,

06:53.613 --> 06:55.348
because you agree with them,

06:55.348 --> 06:57.083
that you should
be treated badly?

07:04.524 --> 07:06.259
- I could see that
being a thing.

07:08.661 --> 07:09.462
- [Psychologist] How you doing?

07:09.462 --> 07:10.730
- I'm good, how are you?

07:11.831 --> 07:13.499
- [Psychologist] Good,
are you really good,

07:13.499 --> 07:15.368
or you're just kind of good?

07:15.368 --> 07:18.104
- Honestly, I am spectacular.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.872
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.008
- [Psychologist] Why?

07:22.008 --> 07:24.177
- I just kind of,
feel like at bliss.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.412
You know, when you kind of like,

07:26.412 --> 07:28.748
feel like you're starting
to be on your path

07:28.748 --> 07:31.250
of finding your,

07:33.386 --> 07:34.854
just finding your path,

07:34.854 --> 07:36.556
you feel like you've finally
found what you wanna do.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.090
I feel like I'm
finally getting there.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.525
- [Psychologist] So, you
think life sucks then,

07:39.525 --> 07:41.761
you think life is very
difficult and it sucks,

07:41.761 --> 07:43.930
and you were dealt a shitty
hand, and life sucks?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.732
- Yeah.

07:46.732 --> 07:47.800
(Psychologist chuckles)

07:47.800 --> 07:49.268
Why is that funny?

07:49.268 --> 07:51.137
- [Psychologist] Because, it's
funny that you think that.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.738
- But, it's my reality.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.907
It's like, everything
around me is like that.

07:54.907 --> 07:58.177
- [Psychologist] Yeah, but the
reality is that, your world,

07:58.177 --> 08:00.713
is your world to make
what you want of it.

08:00.713 --> 08:04.383
And so, if you're blaming
everything else for,

08:04.383 --> 08:07.153
you having a shitty life,
chances are it's your fault.

08:10.890 --> 08:11.824
- I am not married, no.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.059
- [Psychologist] No?

08:13.059 --> 08:14.560
- Divorced.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.529
- [Psychologist] Divorced,
do you have a boyfriend?

08:16.529 --> 08:17.997
- (scoffs) No.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.566
- [Psychologist] No, when's the
last time you dated someone?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.473
- Like, dated or?

08:27.473 --> 08:29.709
- [Psychologist] Like,
serious relationship.

08:29.709 --> 08:33.946
- Oh, it's been a
couple of years.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.214
- [Psychologist] Really?

08:35.214 --> 08:36.082
Hello?

08:40.319 --> 08:43.089
Oh, okay, so did you
park on the side?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.998
You pulled in the
gate though or no?

08:53.266 --> 08:54.767
Oh, you didn't?

08:54.767 --> 08:56.269
Maybe you need to
hear the truth.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.337
Maybe you haven't heard the
truth for so fucking long,

08:58.337 --> 09:01.007
that to finally hear it
is so shocking to you.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.642
And, you wanna
call me an asshole,

09:02.642 --> 09:03.809
you wanna call everybody
else an asshole,

09:03.809 --> 09:05.077
you wanna call the cop

09:05.077 --> 09:06.279
who pulled you over an
asshole, or whatever.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.981
But, maybe it's
you, maybe it's you.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.483
- I'm an asshole?

09:10.483 --> 09:12.885
- [Psychologist] No, maybe
you're doing the wrong things

09:12.885 --> 09:15.721
that are bringing
assholes to tell you,

09:15.721 --> 09:19.358
the reality of you
doing the wrong things,

09:19.358 --> 09:20.326
and you hate that.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.963
You hate the truth, you hate it.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.337
Oh, okay, so did you
park on the side?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.776
I'm not sure where
Island View is, but.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.444
- Do I need sex?

09:38.444 --> 09:40.112
- [Psychologist] Well, I'm
saying everybody needs sex,

09:40.112 --> 09:42.782
I won't even ask you that, of
course, everybody needs that,

09:42.782 --> 09:47.053
but do you just kind of, hook
up and not have have long-

09:47.053 --> 09:49.155
- If I need to, sure.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.658
- [Psychologist] So, anyway,
I'm running a little behind

09:52.658 --> 09:54.694
with somebody I'm with now.

09:54.694 --> 09:57.863
So, you're in the right place,
it's really nice around here,

09:57.863 --> 09:59.465
if you wouldn't mind
just killing like,

09:59.465 --> 10:01.334
maybe 15 to 20 minutes?

10:01.334 --> 10:04.370
And then, coming in, and
then I'll buzz you in.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.872
- All my life my
focus is on women.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.441
I would create
these pages on POF,

10:08.441 --> 10:11.143
and all these fucking
websites and shit,

10:11.143 --> 10:13.312
'cause I never had a mom,
I never had these things.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.214
I'm like, damn, I don't
know what I'm looking for?

10:15.214 --> 10:17.450
I never went to myself for once.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.151
The minute I realized like,
man, hold the fuck on.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.754
I haven't been doing
shit and nothing changed?

10:21.754 --> 10:23.155
I'm gonna focus on me,
right away (snapping),

10:23.155 --> 10:25.257
everything was like
clockwork for myself.

10:25.257 --> 10:26.726
I'm like, hold on,
all my attention,

10:26.726 --> 10:28.461
and I got what I
was looking for.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.763
- [Psychologist] Awesome,
okay, I'll see you soon.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.031
Okay, bye.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.767
- Oh, thank god, I'm so sorry.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.103
(Victoria sighs)
- [Psychologist] Why though,
why are you depressed

10:37.103 --> 10:38.170
with me saying this?

10:39.271 --> 10:41.207
Why are you getting
into this whole,

10:41.207 --> 10:42.808
oh, poor me, thing again?

10:44.176 --> 10:46.345
Why not see that
as a good thing?

10:46.345 --> 10:48.614
I just gave you the key
to something important,

10:48.614 --> 10:50.983
maybe you could change your life

10:50.983 --> 10:52.985
by doing something different.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.820
I just gave you that,
you should be happy,

10:54.820 --> 10:55.955
you should be smiling.

10:59.992 --> 11:04.230
- Uh, does it like,
it happens overnight?

11:05.264 --> 11:06.499
- [Psychologist] It could.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.969
People need to
fucking hear shit.

11:09.969 --> 11:14.440
I'm so tired of people being
in denial about who they are,

11:14.440 --> 11:16.776
about what they're doing,
about what their behavior is.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.644
Instead of just waking
up to the fact that,

11:18.644 --> 11:22.848
hey, your life sucks,
because you're in denial.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.352
- I'll just transform into
a new person overnight?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.621
- [Psychologist] You don't
have to be a new person,

11:28.621 --> 11:30.856
you have to be less the
shitty person you've been.

11:38.731 --> 11:39.632
- Okay.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.834
- Do you think by,

11:42.935 --> 11:44.670
being frustrated with
people that aren't

11:44.670 --> 11:46.505
evolving for themselves,

11:46.505 --> 11:50.009
or wanting to at least
show people the way,

11:50.009 --> 11:51.677
being a shepherd to some degree,

11:54.346 --> 11:55.781
how is that helping you?

11:55.781 --> 11:59.418
How do you see that
benefiting anything at all?

12:01.821 --> 12:03.756
- [Psychologist]
Because, I feel like

12:03.756 --> 12:05.825
my number one

12:05.825 --> 12:10.863
goal in life, is to
matter, I wanna matter.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.300
I want the world to be
different, because of me.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.235
- Everyone has needs, of course.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.171
Men have needs, of course,
they're a little bit different.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.973
- [Psychologist] What happens
when you have sex with a guy,

12:20.973 --> 12:23.476
and then he wants
to see you again?

12:23.476 --> 12:24.910
- Well, we talked about it,

12:24.910 --> 12:29.415
and we decided it was
gonna be just the one time.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.420
I don't have sex with
anyone I wanna see again.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.522
I can't, I'm busy.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.091
I have a dinner meeting.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.227
- [Psychologist] Really?
That's interesting.

12:42.661 --> 12:44.497
I've heard that before, some
people have told me that.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.899
- I did not make that up, I do.

12:46.899 --> 12:47.900
Men are that way.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.137
- [Psychologist] Yeah, but
we don't set out like that.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.671
- I did, I told you I did.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.642
It was fun, but that's
where it ends, it was fun.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.144
- [Psychologist] We just
wanna have sex with-

12:58.144 --> 13:00.880
- I disagree with you there,
I disagree with you there,

13:00.880 --> 13:02.281
I think men do that.
- But, we wanna

13:02.281 --> 13:04.483
have sex with as many
people as possible,

13:04.483 --> 13:08.320
and then we don't know
if we are, you know,

13:08.320 --> 13:11.891
potentially, romantically
interested until after that.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.325
Women are the opposite,

13:13.325 --> 13:15.594
women wanna feel
romantically involved first,

13:15.594 --> 13:17.196
and then have sex, right?

13:19.565 --> 13:20.833
- No.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.768
- [Psychologist] No,
you don't see that?

13:22.768 --> 13:26.071
- It has not been
my experience, no.

13:26.071 --> 13:27.006
Thank you and,

13:29.108 --> 13:30.276
you have a good night.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.249
- I want that connection,

13:37.249 --> 13:38.884
but what's beautiful
is living here,

13:38.884 --> 13:42.354
I've seen that I can connect
with other human beings,

13:42.354 --> 13:46.992
and it doesn't always have
to be on a sexual, intent.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.094
- [Psychologist] But,
for a girl it doesn't,

13:49.094 --> 13:51.096
for a guy it does.
- Right, and that's what

13:51.096 --> 13:53.432
pisses me off.
- It's much cooler,

13:53.432 --> 13:55.067
I bet you have a lot
of guy friends, right?

13:55.067 --> 13:58.237
- I do, I bro out a
lot, I've had a lot of-

13:58.237 --> 13:59.471
- [Psychologist] And, they
wanna hook up with you,

13:59.471 --> 14:00.706
but you don't wanna
hook up with them,

14:00.706 --> 14:01.640
and then it's like
the friend zone,

14:01.640 --> 14:02.942
you've friend-zoned them.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.177
- Right, right.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.011
- [Psychologist] You know what?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.046
It feels better for you,

14:08.414 --> 14:10.616
to feel like everybody else
is wrong and you're right,

14:10.616 --> 14:12.084
of course, right?

14:12.084 --> 14:14.553
It's just easier, 'cause
then you don't gotta do shit.

14:14.553 --> 14:15.955
You don't gotta change nothing,

14:15.955 --> 14:18.390
and you're a great
person in a shitty world.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.830
- Aren't you supposed to
be asking me questions?

14:24.830 --> 14:28.267
- [Psychologist] Not
necessarily, if you want that,

14:28.267 --> 14:29.969
you could go to one of
the regular therapists

14:29.969 --> 14:33.405
that's just like, how is your
childhood, and how is this?

14:33.405 --> 14:34.373
How does that make you feel?

14:34.373 --> 14:35.507
I don't do that shit.

14:40.512 --> 14:43.249
- Man, we can blame, we could
start with a thousand excuses,

14:43.249 --> 14:44.617
we could say a thousand things,

14:44.617 --> 14:46.919
but it starts with
yourself and your thinking.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.421
It's hard, and I get it too,

14:49.421 --> 14:50.890
'cause it's hard
to tell somebody,

14:50.890 --> 14:52.992
hey, you need to
start doing this.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.327
When you're 35, you're telling
me this I'm 35-years old,

14:55.327 --> 14:56.595
you're telling me this at 35,

14:56.595 --> 14:58.464
but I've been programmed
for 35 years of my life.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.166
I hear you, but I can't
turn the shit around,

15:01.166 --> 15:03.068
35 years of
programming, you know?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.571
They say, the hardest thing
to do is to unlearn something.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.505
- But, guess what?

15:06.505 --> 15:07.840
They don't want,

15:08.941 --> 15:11.277
you can and try and help
someone all you want,

15:11.277 --> 15:13.412
but they're not gonna
wanna help themselves,

15:13.412 --> 15:16.148
until they're ready
to do it, feel me?

15:16.148 --> 15:17.583
- What am I supposed to do?

15:19.385 --> 15:21.153
- [Psychologist] You're
supposed to just listen to me.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.221
- I am listening.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.191
- [Psychologist] But, I feel
like you're not taking it in,

15:26.191 --> 15:28.027
it's not registering.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.729
- Is it supposed to
register right now,

15:30.729 --> 15:32.598
(snaps) like magic?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.333
- [Psychologist] It
should and it could,

15:35.434 --> 15:36.335
if you'd let it.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.439
What, you gotta go home,
and you go and drink,

15:40.439 --> 15:43.909
and do some coke, and
go fuck some asshole,

15:43.909 --> 15:46.011
and then fall
asleep next to him.

15:46.011 --> 15:49.882
And then, think about it,
and then he kicks you out,

15:49.882 --> 15:53.352
and then at 6 a.m.
you're getting all
your clothes together,

15:53.352 --> 15:54.620
and going to your car.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.122
You're like, wait a minute,

15:57.122 --> 15:58.290
maybe I should've
listened to him.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.961
Then, is that when you're
gonna think about it or no?

16:03.429 --> 16:04.763
Is that a pretty
accurate description

16:04.763 --> 16:07.333
of how your nights go or no?

16:08.267 --> 16:09.735
Am I being a dick?

16:09.735 --> 16:12.104
Am I insulting you, am I making
him feel bad about yourself?

16:17.509 --> 16:18.944
Or, am I just being honest?

16:21.280 --> 16:24.984
- Do you feel cute being in the
room with six of these guys,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.485
at least seven that
you've seen their dicks?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.786
- [Psychologist] And,
what do they think of her?

16:27.786 --> 16:28.887
They think she's a slut.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.024
- That's what I'm saying.
- They don't respect her.

16:32.024 --> 16:33.192
- Absolutely.
- Just like the

16:33.192 --> 16:34.660
stripper thing,
you're not empowered.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.195
It's not good for you,
you didn't use them,

16:36.195 --> 16:37.363
they fucking used you.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.432
- And, that's all
I wish for in life,

16:40.432 --> 16:42.701
is we all deserve
mutually, respect.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.603
- [Psychologist] Keep your
fucking morality, good for you.

16:44.603 --> 16:45.804
- Thank you.

16:45.804 --> 16:47.306
- [Psychologist]
You're saying that,

16:47.306 --> 16:49.508
if you meet a guy that you
are attracted to enough

16:49.508 --> 16:52.644
to have sex with, you'll
only have sex with him,

16:52.644 --> 16:57.049
if you know that it can't
be a serious relationship.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.219
- Yes, I just don't
let that happen.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.088
You're a man, you should
know what that's like.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.825
- Well, it's funny, because I
kinda do know what it's like,

17:06.825 --> 17:08.027
and now I'm like, what the fuck?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.529
Why do so many girls
wanna have sex with me?

17:10.529 --> 17:11.997
And then, I'm like, shit,

17:11.997 --> 17:13.565
maybe that's a bad thing
now that you're saying that.

17:13.565 --> 17:14.767
Or, does that affect you,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.835
because I just painted
a picture of like,

17:16.835 --> 17:19.138
at least one day
in your last week.

17:19.138 --> 17:23.542
(Victoria sighs)
(Psychologist chuckles)

17:23.542 --> 17:26.278
- I just don't wanna feel
judged in this environment.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.048
- - [Psychologist] It's not
about being judged, it's about-

17:29.048 --> 17:31.617
- So, fine, yeah.

17:31.617 --> 17:36.688
If that's what, one of my
days was like this past week.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.059
Fine.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.528
- [Psychologist]
Then so be it, right?

17:42.528 --> 17:44.296
You're a young girl, you
get to do what you want,

17:44.296 --> 17:45.531
you get to live how you want,

17:45.531 --> 17:47.199
you get to fuck
whoever you want,

17:47.199 --> 17:48.600
you can do whatever
you want, right?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.203
And who are you to
judge me, right?

17:51.203 --> 17:52.104
Is that what you're saying?

17:54.306 --> 17:57.276
- No, I'm saying that...

18:02.448 --> 18:07.152
(sighs) it feels like, if I
admit that that is who I am,

18:07.152 --> 18:11.190
in this room, you're gonna
tell me I'm a shitty person.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.558
- [Psychologist] So now,
that you're saying that,

18:12.558 --> 18:14.193
it's fucking me up,
because then I'm like,

18:14.193 --> 18:17.262
wait a minute, maybe
they're attracted to me to

18:17.262 --> 18:20.399
have sex with, but they're
looking at it like,

18:20.399 --> 18:22.901
I would never be in a longterm
relationship with him.

18:22.901 --> 18:27.973
- And, I would assume you
would like that, that's what-

18:29.308 --> 18:30.742
- [Psychologist] I do, but
it's still kind of insulting,

18:30.742 --> 18:31.977
if that's where they're coming
from (laughs), you know?

18:31.977 --> 18:35.514
- Men are that way, men
are that way as well.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.616
- [Psychologist]
It's case-by-case.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.118
- Okay.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.619
- [Psychologist] Maybe
in your experience,

18:40.619 --> 18:42.488
the men you've met are that way.

18:44.356 --> 18:48.093
- Sure, I think all men
probably are that way.

18:48.093 --> 18:49.261
- [Psychologist]
You say men, a lot,

18:49.261 --> 18:51.130
and you say all men, a lot,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.432
do you think you're a
little bit sexist or no?

18:53.432 --> 18:54.933
- No.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.102
- [Psychologist] You think can
judge every man as a whole?

18:58.303 --> 19:01.273
- I will say, most
then, I will say, most.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.809
- [Psychologist] So you think
it's the exact same thing,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.944
if a girl has with
lots and lots of guys,

19:05.944 --> 19:09.114
that it is for a guy to
have sex with lots of girls?

19:09.114 --> 19:10.282
You really think that?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.018
You don't think that,

19:13.018 --> 19:14.486
nobody thinks that.
- Why would I-

19:14.486 --> 19:15.420
- [Psychologist] You
just tell yourself that,

19:15.420 --> 19:16.622
to justify your behavior,

19:17.890 --> 19:19.858
so you can feel
better about yourself.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.565
Because, who, okay,
there's a guy and a girl,

19:26.565 --> 19:28.100
let's just say on a date, right?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.468
They never had sex before.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.604
What are the odds
that the guy wants,

19:32.604 --> 19:33.572
they're both
good-looking people.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.773
What are the odds that the guy

19:34.773 --> 19:36.542
wants to have sex with the girl?

19:37.776 --> 19:38.610
(Victoria pensively sighs)

19:38.610 --> 19:39.511
Hypothetical.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.181
- High odds.

19:43.148 --> 19:44.716
- [Psychologist] 90, 95?

19:44.716 --> 19:45.617
- Yes.
- Okay,

19:47.686 --> 19:50.622
so the guy clearly wants to
have sex with the girl, right?

19:50.622 --> 19:52.124
But, just because he
wants to have sex,

19:52.124 --> 19:53.759
does that mean he's gonna
have sex with the girl or no?

19:53.759 --> 19:54.693
- No.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.094
- [Psychologist] Okay, why not?

19:58.730 --> 20:01.033
- Because, he doesn't have to?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.334
- [Psychologist]
No, but he wants to,

20:02.334 --> 20:04.903
but who decides whether
the sex will be had,

20:04.903 --> 20:07.239
between those two
people, who decides?

20:09.608 --> 20:10.442
- The girl.

20:10.442 --> 20:11.910
- [Psychologist] Good.

20:11.910 --> 20:14.646
At the bottom of everything,
is everybody's insecure.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.415
Everybody's not up front,

20:16.415 --> 20:19.351
'cause they're afraid to
show that, especially girls.

20:19.351 --> 20:23.355
Girls don't want to just show
a guy that they like them,

20:23.355 --> 20:25.724
if they're nervous that the
guy doesn't like them back.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.992
- Yes.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.361
- [Psychologist] What if
I was to say, all women,

20:30.562 --> 20:31.530
are a certain way?

20:32.931 --> 20:36.602
- You should say,
well, I don't, what do,

20:37.836 --> 20:41.073
I mean, it would depend
on what you were saying,

20:41.073 --> 20:42.674
that all women are or-

20:42.674 --> 20:44.977
- [Psychologist] All women
wanna have sex with me.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.479
(both laugh)

20:48.580 --> 20:49.448
- Okay.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.151
- [Psychologist] Here's the
thing, I know that it's,

20:53.151 --> 20:56.088
a completely different
experience to be a girl.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.790
I'm very well aware
that as a guy,

20:58.790 --> 21:01.260
I have no idea what it's
like to be in the body

21:01.260 --> 21:04.096
of a fucking girl, well,
not in that way, I guess.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.767
You have your own
experience like that.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.973
Yeah, even if you're
like remotely attractive,

21:14.973 --> 21:16.441
dudes wanna fuck
you all the time.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.909
- Yeah, it's really annoying.

21:17.909 --> 21:21.647
- [Psychologist] Okay, since
the girl decides, right?

21:21.647 --> 21:24.316
Then that means that sex
is, almost exclusively,

21:24.316 --> 21:26.318
always up to the girl
to decide, right?

21:27.219 --> 21:28.053
Is that correct?

21:28.053 --> 21:28.954
Which is good.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.423
Right?

21:34.559 --> 21:37.195
If the girl always decides
whether sex is gonna be had,

21:37.195 --> 21:39.631
and sex is being had
pretty fucking often,

21:39.631 --> 21:41.566
then it's the girl's
decision, is it not?

21:41.566 --> 21:44.503
Guys will fuck anybody, right?

21:44.503 --> 21:47.005
Shouldn't the girl
be more exclusive,

21:47.005 --> 21:50.075
more selective of
who she has sex with?

21:51.777 --> 21:53.178
- Yeah.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.880
- [Psychologist] Right?

21:54.880 --> 21:55.814
- [Psychologist] I
mean, does it make

21:55.814 --> 21:57.049
logical sense to you or no?

22:03.021 --> 22:04.256
- Yeah.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.724
- [Psychologist] 'Cause,
they're so insecure,

22:05.724 --> 22:07.225
they're so nervous about
what would happen if he knew.

22:07.225 --> 22:08.794
And then, oh my god, what
if he doesn't like me?

22:08.794 --> 22:11.730
I'll feel stupid, I'll be
humiliated, and whatever.

22:11.730 --> 22:15.334
- That's why you have to,
you look fear in the face,

22:15.334 --> 22:17.002
and you tell it to fuck off.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.503
I mean, 'cause in reality,

22:18.503 --> 22:20.706
fear and doubt is what
holds us back the most.

22:20.706 --> 22:23.375
Until you realize that
and get over that,

22:23.375 --> 22:25.644
then you're gonna go
much farther in life.

22:25.644 --> 22:28.714
- [Psychologist] The best
gauge of whether you think

22:28.714 --> 22:31.516
that a behavior is okay,

22:31.516 --> 22:33.018
especially when it
comes to females,

22:33.018 --> 22:37.589
is ask yourself, would you be
okay if your mother did it,

22:37.589 --> 22:40.092
your daughter did it,
your sister did it?

22:41.460 --> 22:43.528
If the answer is yes,
then you know what?

22:43.528 --> 22:46.765
Fine.
- Right, these girls saying,

22:46.765 --> 22:51.169
well, if I'm gonna, use my
body for what it's worth,

22:51.169 --> 22:55.374
no, no, who told you
that, where did you?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.641
- [Psychologist] I know,

22:56.641 --> 22:59.811
it's an absence of
any moral center.

22:59.811 --> 23:03.682
But, say all women want
a serious relationship,

23:03.682 --> 23:05.851
sometimes they're just
afraid to pursue it.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.420
- I would say, you're wrong.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.922
- [Psychologist] Okay,
and would you say that,

23:10.922 --> 23:14.793
I shouldn't make such a grand
assessment, and say all women?

23:14.793 --> 23:16.528
Or, would you say you feel like-

23:16.528 --> 23:18.330
- It's just ignorant, it's just-

23:18.330 --> 23:21.533
- [Psychologist] Shouldn't the
girl hold the higher standard

23:21.533 --> 23:22.334
than a guy?

23:22.334 --> 23:23.769
Why have the same,

23:23.769 --> 23:26.772
why lower your own standards
to the same standards,

23:26.772 --> 23:28.273
as a guy's lower standards?

23:28.273 --> 23:30.108
Guys will fuck anybody,
guys will fuck fat girls,

23:30.108 --> 23:33.145
whatever it may be, why lower
yourself to that standard?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.379
Why not hold a higher standard?

23:34.379 --> 23:35.781
I only have sex
with certain guys.

23:35.781 --> 23:38.517
I only have sex with
guys that love me,

23:39.885 --> 23:44.022
that have a certain quality,
that I've known for more than-

23:44.022 --> 23:45.824
- What kind of
girls get to grow up

23:45.824 --> 23:49.561
and have that point
of view, princesses?

23:49.561 --> 23:54.199
Girls that, from the day
their born have that choice,

23:54.199 --> 23:57.736
because there's lots of people
that are born into this world

23:57.736 --> 24:02.808
where it's not their choice
how their sexual life begins,

24:04.142 --> 24:06.378
and things start happening
without their consent,

24:06.378 --> 24:08.447
and they didn't say it was okay.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.851
No one ever said it was okay

24:12.851 --> 24:15.086
for the little girl to have sex.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.725
So I'm sorry that I've had
sex with so many people now.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.428
- [Psychologist] But,
why do you feel like

24:23.428 --> 24:24.663
if that happened to you,

24:24.663 --> 24:26.698
that you have to have
sex with other guys?

24:26.698 --> 24:27.899
What it is it about that,

24:27.899 --> 24:29.701
you're trying to
take the power back?

24:29.701 --> 24:31.236
You're trying to control-
- Yeah, maybe I want

24:31.236 --> 24:33.672
the power back, maybe
that's what it is,

24:33.672 --> 24:36.741
because when the power's taken
from you when you're little,

24:41.980 --> 24:43.849
you have to make
sense of it again.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.451
- [Psychologist] But, is
that your power ever then?

24:46.451 --> 24:48.019
- No, I don't know.
- If you go and have sex

24:48.019 --> 24:51.089
with a lot of other guys, they
still have power over you,

24:51.089 --> 24:52.324
you're just handing
it to 'em more-

24:52.324 --> 24:54.292
- How come I don't
have power of them?

24:54.292 --> 24:56.595
- [Psychologist] Because,
they are getting something

24:56.595 --> 24:58.730
out of you, not vice versa.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.768
What if I said, most
women truly want

25:03.768 --> 25:06.972
a serious relationship, truly
wanna have a family one day,

25:06.972 --> 25:08.940
truly feel better
and happier when

25:08.940 --> 25:10.475
they're in a
relationship, and married,

25:10.475 --> 25:13.879
and with somebody
longterm, would you agree?

25:16.014 --> 25:18.850
- I would say that,
that might be.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.419
- [Psychologist] But, not you.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.821
- No.
- Why not you?

25:23.788 --> 25:25.624
- I don't have time for that.

25:25.624 --> 25:26.892
- [Psychologist]
How is having sex

25:26.892 --> 25:29.661
with more creepy fucking
weirdos gonna be better?

25:29.661 --> 25:32.964
How is it gonna make
it better for you?

25:32.964 --> 25:34.566
I really wanna know,
I'm really asking,

25:34.566 --> 25:36.067
'cause I really don't know.

25:36.067 --> 25:39.271
I really don't get that, I
don't get that manifestation.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.505
- I'm just trying
to love myself more,

25:40.505 --> 25:42.007
which is what I've done.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.275
My New Year's resolution was
to love myself, and that's

25:43.275 --> 25:44.543
what I've been doing.
- Why do you feel like

25:44.543 --> 25:46.244
you need a resolution
to love yourself more?

25:46.244 --> 25:47.512
You don't love yourself?

25:47.512 --> 25:48.947
- I didn't, no, I didn't.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.816
I was very insecure.
- Before (muffled speaking)-

25:51.816 --> 25:54.185
- Yeah, probably
like a year ago.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.420
- [Psychologist] Why are you

25:55.420 --> 25:57.055
not interested in a
serious relationship?

25:58.523 --> 26:00.158
- Because,

26:00.158 --> 26:03.461
I have not met one man who,

26:04.963 --> 26:07.566
is worth my time in that way.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.835
- [Psychologist] Okay,
if you did meet a man

26:10.835 --> 26:12.304
that was worth your time-

26:12.304 --> 26:13.572
- (laughs) Right.

26:13.572 --> 26:17.409
- I just, sometimes am
in a situation where,

26:17.409 --> 26:20.879
I think that a guy
is gonna look at me,

26:20.879 --> 26:22.847
and he's gonna want
to get to know me.

26:24.215 --> 26:28.987
Then, usually they just end
up asking to have sex with me,

26:29.988 --> 26:31.590
and I don't feel
confident enough to say,

26:31.590 --> 26:34.826
no, there is more
to me than that.

26:34.826 --> 26:38.496
I proceed, and I hope
that after I go along

26:38.496 --> 26:42.000
with what they wanted, they'll
go along with what I wanted.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.268
You know, it happens,

26:43.268 --> 26:45.236
they don't go along
with what I wanted.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.404
- [Psychologist] That's
right, they don't,

26:46.404 --> 26:47.372
I think you're making
a bad decision,

26:47.372 --> 26:48.873
because, can I help you?

26:48.873 --> 26:52.577
Listen, if you meet a guy and
you're into him or whatever,

26:52.577 --> 26:54.145
and he's trying
to have sex quick,

26:54.145 --> 26:57.549
all you have to do is
not have sex quick,

26:57.549 --> 27:00.352
because at the very least,

27:00.352 --> 27:02.654
he still wants to
have sex with you.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.323
He'll put in more time, he'll
see you for the second date,

27:05.323 --> 27:06.958
the third date, the fourth date,

27:06.958 --> 27:08.994
all the while he
learns more about you.

27:08.994 --> 27:10.762
Then when you finally
have sex with him,

27:10.762 --> 27:11.963
then he knows more about you,

27:11.963 --> 27:13.598
and can have more
feelings towards you.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.033
Instead of you just
being some hot girl

27:15.033 --> 27:16.234
that he fucked one night.

27:16.234 --> 27:17.736
It wouldn't be
smarter for a girl

27:17.736 --> 27:20.138
to make the guy wait for sex,

27:20.138 --> 27:24.175
because then you're gonna
get him emotionally attached,

27:24.175 --> 27:25.377
'cause he's been
waiting around so long.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.811
Then, when you finally
have sex with him,

27:26.811 --> 27:28.413
he cares about you emotionally.

27:29.514 --> 27:30.448
You have sex with
him right away,

27:30.448 --> 27:31.383
he don't give a shit about you,

27:31.383 --> 27:33.284
he just thinks you're a slut.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.086
- At all, and if you don't
have sex with him too,

27:35.086 --> 27:36.688
and you make him wait
longer and he leaves,

27:36.688 --> 27:39.090
that's good, 'cause it
just shows his true colors.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.626
Okay, I knew it, I was just
testing you motherfucker.

27:41.626 --> 27:42.794
- [Psychologist] There you go,

27:42.794 --> 27:44.029
and you know that's
all he wanted.

27:44.029 --> 27:45.597
You're making the
wrong decision,

27:45.597 --> 27:48.233
you shouldn't have
sex with him quick.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.803
Didn't your mom ever teach
you this kind of stuff?

27:51.803 --> 27:54.572
This is like 101, you
make the guy wait,

27:54.572 --> 27:57.542
maybe you make out with him
a little, but then that's it.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.577
Maybe the second date you
fool around a little bit,

27:59.577 --> 28:02.180
but that's it, like
you gotta build it up.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.417
How do you not
know these things?

28:14.025 --> 28:19.030
- (sighs) I don't know,
I just didn't know them.

28:20.498 --> 28:21.599
- [Psychologist] But,
does it make sense to you?

28:21.599 --> 28:23.568
- Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

28:26.137 --> 28:27.706
- Sometimes, I feel like,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.174
that's why I feel like the girls

28:29.174 --> 28:32.010
should always make the
first move, to be honest.

28:32.010 --> 28:32.944
- [Psychologist] That's, see-

28:32.944 --> 28:34.179
- That's how I truly I feel,

28:34.179 --> 28:35.380
because if I want
that to happen,

28:35.380 --> 28:36.614
then I'm gonna grab your hand,

28:36.614 --> 28:38.650
and then you know
you can go farther,

28:38.650 --> 28:39.951
you know what I'm saying?

28:39.951 --> 28:41.653
- [Psychologist] Most girls
don't roll like that at all.

28:41.653 --> 28:42.921
- I know.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.122
- [Psychologist] Are
you hopeless though,

28:44.122 --> 28:45.724
do you think you'll never
find a guy that will fit?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.625
- I don't care.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.793
- You don't care?
- No.

28:48.793 --> 28:49.594
- [Psychologist]
You'll just go through

28:49.594 --> 28:50.662
the rest of your life,

28:50.662 --> 28:51.930
and never be in a serious
relationship again,

28:51.930 --> 28:52.864
and you're totally
okay with that?

28:52.864 --> 28:54.132
- Fine.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.468
- [Psychologist]
Traditionally, look at the 50s.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.002
- Love 'em.

28:58.002 --> 29:01.239
- [Psychologist] Guys and
girls would go to get a soda

29:01.239 --> 29:03.241
at the fucking diner,

29:03.241 --> 29:06.211
and then they'd need a
chaperone if it was past 8 p.m.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.381
All those traditional values
from like the 50s and shit,

29:10.381 --> 29:13.585
where it's like, maybe you
hold a hand on the first date,

29:13.585 --> 29:15.754
and then you kiss a little
bit on the second date.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.222
We should go back to that.

29:17.222 --> 29:21.493
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
yeah, 'cause today's shit, yeah.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.661
- [Psychologist] This might be
the answer we're looking for,

29:23.661 --> 29:24.896
you know why?

29:24.896 --> 29:26.431
'Cause they understood
basic human nature,

29:26.431 --> 29:30.468
that males and females
are gonna be doing stuff

29:30.468 --> 29:33.104
if they're left alone for
too long, if whatever.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.140
And, the guy's gonna
be trying to do stuff,

29:35.140 --> 29:37.575
and the girl should,
no proper girl,

29:37.575 --> 29:39.310
no, you can't hold my hand yet,

29:39.310 --> 29:40.879
we haven't even known each other

29:40.879 --> 29:42.147
for more than a week.
- I love it.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.581
- [Psychologist] Yeah,
today's it all a mess,

29:43.581 --> 29:47.619
and no coincidence that
everybody's so sexually open,

29:48.286 --> 29:49.687
and blah, blah, blah.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.189
But, at the same time,
divorces are through the roof,

29:51.189 --> 29:53.525
people that are fucking
married are at their lowest

29:53.525 --> 29:55.493
in the history of
the fucking country.

29:55.493 --> 29:58.296
STDs are up, women
not being happy

29:58.296 --> 30:00.799
and being old cat ladies who
can't even find a fucking-

30:00.799 --> 30:02.267
- Yeah.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.568
- [Psychologist] Dudes
being fucking beta males,

30:03.568 --> 30:05.069
kissing girls asses,

30:05.069 --> 30:06.304
'cause they don't know how
to fucking act around women,

30:06.304 --> 30:08.206
all these problems
are fucking coming.

30:08.206 --> 30:11.009
All that sexual revolution
shit, it's not working,

30:11.009 --> 30:12.177
it's not fucking working.
- Yeah, it's not.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.078
- Kissing the
hand, the forehead.

30:14.078 --> 30:16.247
- Holding hands.
- Opening your door,

30:16.247 --> 30:18.283
opening your chair
when you sit down,

30:18.283 --> 30:22.520
it's all the old,
things that are just,

30:22.520 --> 30:23.688
I feel like, meant to be,

30:23.688 --> 30:26.591
and now today they
just rap about bitches.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.992
- [Psychologist] Again,
that's why you're here,

30:27.992 --> 30:29.894
so that I can try to
figure out what's going on.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.329
'Cause you know,

30:31.329 --> 30:33.665
a lot of times the person

30:33.665 --> 30:36.968
who knows the least about
a person, is themselves.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.171
- Victoria, off
the phone please.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.174
Victoria, I am looking for
the Jeffrey Bolton deposition,

30:43.174 --> 30:45.810
it was supposed to be
on my desk at 7:00.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.513
I can't seem to find it
anywhere, it wasn't on my desk.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.781
- I filed that.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.683
- You think you
know more already?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.218
- [Psychologist] I
don't think that,

30:53.218 --> 30:54.118
but I think it's possible.

30:54.118 --> 30:55.453
- Okay.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.355
Did you put in Room A or
did you put it in Room B,

30:57.355 --> 30:58.423
do you remember?

30:59.490 --> 31:01.059
- Room B.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.560
- [Psychologist] That's why
I'm in this business, right?

31:02.560 --> 31:05.230
I'm able to pick up on cues,
I'm able to pick up on,

31:06.598 --> 31:08.633
things you might say or
ways you might come across,

31:08.633 --> 31:10.401
that you're not
necessarily aware of.

31:10.401 --> 31:13.104
- All of the depositions, I've
told you this so many times,

31:13.104 --> 31:15.506
they go into Room A,
in alphabetical order.

31:15.506 --> 31:18.476
I need that deposition
and I need you to find it.

31:18.476 --> 31:20.011
Can we clean up in here?

31:20.011 --> 31:22.213
I'm so sick of it looking
like a bomb went off,

31:22.213 --> 31:23.982
every time I enter this room.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.750
I'm here to give it a shot, yes.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.218
- [Psychologist]
Okay, but you know,

31:27.218 --> 31:29.087
I would ask that you don't
have you defenses up.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.355
- You know, Victoria,

31:30.355 --> 31:32.690
we had the wrong date on
the Thompson case file.

31:32.690 --> 31:35.326
Your notes were
completely sloppy,

31:35.326 --> 31:36.594
I gave you this job,

31:36.594 --> 31:38.363
because you said that
you were hardworking,

31:38.363 --> 31:39.964
you said that you
were detail-oriented,

31:39.964 --> 31:41.432
and are neither of those things!

31:41.432 --> 31:43.534
Well, I am here.
- In the end,

31:43.534 --> 31:44.469
I'm on your side.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.239
- Are you, okay?
- Yeah, totally.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.375
- Yeah, you're here
to help, right?

31:50.375 --> 31:51.576
You help people.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.810
- [Psychologist] That's
my whole life goal.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.279
- I need someone who
can get things right,

31:54.279 --> 31:55.847
do you understand if you can't,

31:55.847 --> 31:57.548
you won't be here much longer.

31:58.516 --> 31:59.684
- Samantha, woo?

32:06.324 --> 32:07.525
(papers rustling)

32:07.525 --> 32:09.294
Can I ask you a question?

32:10.662 --> 32:12.997
Have you ever worked
in an office before?

32:16.301 --> 32:17.535
- [Psychologist] You
gotta realize that

32:17.535 --> 32:21.105
I'm telling you things
that are gonna help you.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.642
- Yeah, no, I think
that a lot of stuff

32:24.642 --> 32:26.311
has been really helpful.

32:26.311 --> 32:29.314
- Because, you're feeling like
you're trying to help women,

32:31.249 --> 32:32.483
by waking them up,

32:32.483 --> 32:35.586
but you're scared that
you're gonna maybe,

32:36.988 --> 32:40.024
shake up someone's who not
ready to face their shit.

32:40.024 --> 32:40.959
- [Psychologist] You
know what's progress?

32:40.959 --> 32:41.960
That you haven't been drinking.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.394
You know what's progress?

32:43.394 --> 32:46.064
That you look so much better,
that you look brighter,

32:46.064 --> 32:47.932
that your pretty face
is coming through again,

32:47.932 --> 32:50.268
as opposed to all that
heavy, dark makeup

32:50.268 --> 32:52.603
that you always used to
wear, that's progress.

32:52.603 --> 32:57.675
- I am here to give it a try,
to see if that is the case.

32:59.077 --> 33:01.045
- [Psychologist] Why though,
why did you make that step,

33:01.045 --> 33:03.147
to finally do that?

33:03.147 --> 33:08.219
- Because, I've not had a
decent night's sleep in,

33:08.920 --> 33:10.455
in years, I can't,

33:10.455 --> 33:13.324
I think maybe the last time
I had a good night's sleep

33:13.324 --> 33:15.560
was maybe five, six years ago.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.061
- [Psychologist] Really?

33:17.061 --> 33:18.529
- We've been coming in late,
we've been leaving early,

33:18.529 --> 33:21.933
and that's absolutely
unacceptable.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.134
Henry, I know you're new,

33:23.134 --> 33:26.838
but you lost a
client last month?

33:26.838 --> 33:31.809
Because, of something
that happened to me and,

33:34.045 --> 33:36.614
sleep is kind of, a trigger for
all those things to come up,

33:36.614 --> 33:40.752
and I am unable to have
a good night's sleep.

33:40.752 --> 33:41.986
- [Psychologist]
Well, let's hold off

33:41.986 --> 33:43.354
a little bit on what happened.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.089
- Listen, I apologize,

33:46.157 --> 33:48.459
my wife had our first
kid, last month.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.428
- Excuses, excuses, Henry.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.063
You told me that your
wife was pregnant,

33:52.063 --> 33:55.166
and you said that it would
not affect your work here,

33:55.166 --> 33:57.235
and it is.
- In Henry's defense,

33:57.235 --> 33:59.537
that guy is not the-
- Roger, Roger, you can

33:59.537 --> 34:01.039
leave the meeting now, okay?

34:01.039 --> 34:03.374
Out, anyone else
wanna interrupt?

34:03.374 --> 34:04.742
- [Psychologist]
Not only do you want

34:04.742 --> 34:05.977
a better night's sleep,

34:05.977 --> 34:09.013
but you'd like to be
happier in general, no?

34:09.013 --> 34:11.315
- Well, of course, I would
like to be happier, yes.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.517
Victoria, you're always late,

34:12.517 --> 34:14.052
we can discuss
that further later.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.188
- [Psychologist]
The progress is that

34:17.188 --> 34:19.223
you are actually
saying, oh, yeah,

34:19.223 --> 34:20.725
because this, I thought this.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.428
That's you thinking for
yourself, that's progress.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.364
That's progress, not,

34:26.364 --> 34:29.500
I joined some group that tells
me what to fucking think,

34:29.500 --> 34:30.401
that's not progress.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.036
- No, you're right.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.273
- [Psychologist]
Are you not happy?

34:35.273 --> 34:36.441
- Well, I am,

34:38.076 --> 34:38.976
I am,

34:41.546 --> 34:45.016
I'm not entirely happy.

34:46.384 --> 34:48.553
You've let this company
down, you've let me down,

34:48.553 --> 34:50.154
you've let all of us down.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.356
This meeting is over,
get out, get out!

34:56.060 --> 34:57.462
- Can you imagine the world,

34:57.462 --> 35:00.131
if every single human being was,

35:01.399 --> 35:06.037
in their self power, of
expression of exactly what they-

35:06.037 --> 35:07.638
- [Psychologist] That's
how the world should be.

35:07.638 --> 35:08.573
I understand that you're trying,

35:08.573 --> 35:10.441
but at the same time it's like,

35:10.441 --> 35:11.709
you gotta keep in mind,

35:11.709 --> 35:14.512
there's such a big
picture to things.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.047
You have to stop seeing
things small picture

35:16.047 --> 35:19.617
through your own eyes, and see
things through a grander view

35:19.617 --> 35:21.018
of what the big picture is.

35:25.089 --> 35:28.493
(Victoria sighs)

35:28.493 --> 35:29.927
- That's a lot to take in.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.299
- [Psychologist] Are you
able to put your finger on

35:35.299 --> 35:37.001
why you're not happy?

35:40.004 --> 35:42.673
- I'm not, I don't
know, I'm not, I don't,

35:42.673 --> 35:43.908
I'm not able to.
- Is that also

35:43.908 --> 35:44.809
why you're here?

35:46.711 --> 35:48.479
To try to figure that out?

35:48.479 --> 35:50.114
- I don't need to know that.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.518
- [Psychologist] When you reach
a true level of happiness,

35:53.518 --> 35:55.853
me telling you anything,
would never bring you down,

35:55.853 --> 35:57.555
no matter what it is.

35:57.555 --> 36:00.458
Not one thing, and not
because you don't believe me,

36:00.458 --> 36:04.595
but because you know and
you're aware of things.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.631
What anybody else says,
what anybody else does,

36:06.631 --> 36:09.233
is not gonna affect you
badly, no matter what it is.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.602
Could be the worst thing ever
somebody could say to you.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.638
- Okay, yeah,

36:14.872 --> 36:17.508
that's when I'll
know that I'm, good?

36:18.442 --> 36:19.744
- [Psychologist] And then,
you can stop coming to me.

36:20.811 --> 36:22.580
Are you looking forward
to that (chuckles)?

36:23.714 --> 36:25.283
- Will you be offended?

36:25.283 --> 36:26.517
- [Psychologist] Nope.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.052
What would you say
if I told you that,

36:28.052 --> 36:30.121
my goal is to make you happy?

36:34.492 --> 36:37.562
- I would say that is
reaching very high.

36:39.297 --> 36:41.832
- I don't wanna feel
shitty all the time.

36:43.267 --> 36:44.635
- [Psychologist]
Then you shouldn't.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.804
- I haven't been feeling
as shitty lately.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.640
- [Psychologist] And, why?

36:49.640 --> 36:54.178
- Just think, the
stuff we talk about,

36:57.682 --> 37:00.685
it's really hard for me
to listen to, you know?

37:01.719 --> 37:05.356
'Cause, you are really
brutally honest,

37:05.356 --> 37:10.428
but I feel like, 'cause I write
everything down afterwards,

37:11.429 --> 37:16.133
and I try to
honestly take it in.

37:16.133 --> 37:21.205
I think it's helping me be
more honest with myself.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.674
- [Psychologist] You
do seem very guarded.

37:25.009 --> 37:26.877
- Okay, well,

37:28.112 --> 37:30.014
I don't really know you.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.849
- It just seems really,

37:35.319 --> 37:40.391
unbelievable that I could
feel good, like really good,

37:41.993 --> 37:46.030
without other people
looking at me,

37:46.030 --> 37:48.099
and telling me that I'm good.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.769
- Why do you care about it?
- I care about it,

37:51.769 --> 37:53.871
because, first of all,
I care about everybody,

37:53.871 --> 37:55.339
I care about you.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.341
I don't have to know people
well to care about them.

37:57.341 --> 37:58.743
- I had to go home,
and change and-

37:58.743 --> 38:01.646
- No one wonder our
productivity is down,

38:01.646 --> 38:02.913
this isn't a social circle,

38:02.913 --> 38:05.316
this isn't how we
do things here.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.485
- Samantha, I was just-
- Roger, Roger, you came

38:07.485 --> 38:10.054
over here just to
talk to the ladies?

38:10.054 --> 38:11.722
- [Psychologist] This is a
place where you can literally

38:11.722 --> 38:15.493
feel like you can just say
anything and everything.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.061
- Well, I don't really know you

38:17.061 --> 38:19.263
very well, yet.
- We have to get

38:19.263 --> 38:20.965
to know each other first?
- Well, I mean, it's just,

38:20.965 --> 38:24.402
give me a minute.
- Well...

38:25.803 --> 38:27.638
- We were just talking about-
- You know, sexual harassment

38:27.638 --> 38:31.342
is a very, very serious
issue in the workplace.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.810
You saw the sexual
harassment video,

38:32.810 --> 38:34.879
and you signed off on it
saying, that you wouldn't do it.

38:34.879 --> 38:38.316
Yet, here you are
flirting as usual.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.917
- Samantha, he wasn't-
- Now, I've seen it

38:39.917 --> 38:41.519
more than once, okay?

38:41.519 --> 38:43.421
- [Psychologist] I don't
think that you should

38:43.421 --> 38:46.223
dwell on the things
you didn't have.

38:46.223 --> 38:49.226
And, to make yourself
a victim by saying,

38:49.226 --> 38:50.461
if only I had this,

38:50.461 --> 38:52.563
and if only this person
didn't do this to me,

38:52.563 --> 38:54.332
and if only I had more of this,

38:54.332 --> 38:56.967
those things keep you down
more than anything else.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.470
- We're just having a
conversation, we're sorry

38:59.470 --> 39:01.639
if it bothered you.
- Talking about our weekend.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.908
- No, I'm sorry I
don't accept that.

39:03.908 --> 39:06.610
I don't accept that, not
here, not in the workplace.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.412
I'm not gonna let
you do this to women.

39:08.412 --> 39:10.614
Just tell you
everything I'm feeling?

39:10.614 --> 39:11.782
- [Psychologist] No, but
I can tell there's things

39:11.782 --> 39:13.751
you don't wanna tell me.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.354
I don't know if it's that

39:16.354 --> 39:17.822
you're not being
honest with yourself,

39:17.822 --> 39:19.790
or if it's like, you just
don't wanna be honest with me.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.258
- I've got my eye on you.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.795
- Okay, you know, we just
need to get past this,

39:24.795 --> 39:26.263
and just get back to work.

39:26.263 --> 39:27.798
- Yeah, you do need
to get back to work.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.000
I think that's a great idea.

39:30.000 --> 39:30.901
- Okay.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.808
- You know, you guys
really should care too.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.678
It's not okay for him to come
over here, and talk to you,

39:40.678 --> 39:42.246
and stare at you like that.

39:42.246 --> 39:45.116
- Oh, he wasn't staring,
he was just talking.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.317
- He's never
disrespected me, ever.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.685
- I've seen it more than once,

39:47.685 --> 39:49.387
and the men, they're
all the same.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.556
They seem so harmless.

39:52.556 --> 39:55.826
- People get too much authority,

39:55.826 --> 39:58.562
and then just like, think
that they're the top.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.699
When it's like reality,
we're all fucking equal.

40:01.699 --> 40:02.666
- They said I'm,

40:05.503 --> 40:10.274
little miss perfect, and
I'm daddy's favorite.

40:11.609 --> 40:12.877
- [Psychologist] You didn't
think that was accurate?

40:12.877 --> 40:15.079
- Not at all, I was like,

40:15.079 --> 40:18.649
'cause my dad was a fucking
asshole, he was mean.

40:18.649 --> 40:19.850
- [Psychologist]
I'm leaning towards,

40:19.850 --> 40:21.352
you don't wanna be
honest with yourself.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.057
- What do you, I mean,
I'll tell you (hands slap),

40:28.726 --> 40:30.261
I mean, I'll tell you what you-

40:30.261 --> 40:31.629
- [Psychologist] Why don't you
want to be in a relationship?

40:31.629 --> 40:32.596
- Wanna know (sighs).

40:34.265 --> 40:36.066
I already answered
that question.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.803
- [Psychologist] See,
you're guarded again.

40:38.803 --> 40:41.105
Do you think that you
were attracted to the guy

40:41.105 --> 40:43.941
that you dated, who
was kind of abusive?

40:44.942 --> 40:46.076
- Yeah, he-
- 'Cause he reminded you

40:46.076 --> 40:47.711
of your dad.
- Yes.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.314
- [Psychologist]
You don't feel like

40:50.314 --> 40:51.715
you ever got your
dad's approval then?

40:52.783 --> 40:55.486
- I don't have my
dad's approval, no, no.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.189
I will never get it.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.025
- I told you, I don't-
- Because, no men

41:01.025 --> 41:02.426
meet your standard,

41:02.426 --> 41:03.928
but what I wanted to know was,

41:03.928 --> 41:05.930
that if there was
somebody who did,

41:05.930 --> 41:07.465
would you be willing to do it?

41:09.033 --> 41:11.769
I don't even believe in porn,
I think it's bad for society.

41:13.003 --> 41:15.673
- I like, I love that about you.

41:15.673 --> 41:19.844
That's so refreshing.
- I think it's ridiculous.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.445
Is that something
you think you'd want?

41:21.445 --> 41:23.747
- Well, I suppose it would
depend on the person.

41:23.747 --> 41:27.918
I just, I guess I don't
see that happening,

41:27.918 --> 41:30.621
but I suppose maybe if,

41:33.190 --> 41:35.759
I mean, it'd be hard to imagine

41:35.759 --> 41:37.328
that there's anyone out there.

41:38.896 --> 41:40.731
- [Psychologist]
You're so negative.

41:41.599 --> 41:42.800
- How good of you to show up,

41:42.800 --> 41:44.568
you know you're
almost an hour late?

41:48.539 --> 41:51.475
This isn't even, okay,
why -- this first.

41:51.475 --> 41:54.211
What, what are you wearing?

41:55.112 --> 41:58.148
That is absolutely unacceptable.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.918
I can almost see
your everything,

42:00.918 --> 42:03.120
pull down and pull
up, you know what?

42:04.255 --> 42:07.458
Here, cover it, cover yourself.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.159
Do you see it as negativity?

42:09.159 --> 42:10.895
- [Psychologist]
Yeah, of course,

42:10.895 --> 42:13.030
you saying that you probably
never will be somebody

42:13.030 --> 42:14.031
you wanna be in a
relationship with,

42:14.031 --> 42:15.833
is totally fucking negative.

42:15.833 --> 42:17.334
We're gonna pause real quick.

42:18.836 --> 42:23.007
Make sure you are aware
of what's driving you.

42:23.007 --> 42:24.375
- Right.
- See, that's my whole thing.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.309
- Right, right.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.211
- Dude, our entire society,

42:27.211 --> 42:29.813
is based on somebody
else's ideas.

42:29.813 --> 42:32.049
- That's what I'm saying.
- Everything we do,

42:32.049 --> 42:35.786
everything, our clothes,
our outlook, our life goals,

42:35.786 --> 42:39.657
the way we spend our life,
the jobs we choose, college.

42:39.657 --> 42:42.626
And said, here,
this is what it is,

42:42.626 --> 42:45.129
because I've learned this
and this is the truth.

42:45.129 --> 42:47.531
We're telling you
this now, but what if,

42:47.531 --> 42:50.868
what if that
information is not true?

42:50.868 --> 42:55.940
But, in the end, your core
self is built on how you feel,

42:56.874 --> 42:59.276
and think about yourself.

42:59.276 --> 43:01.845
If you think
negatively of yourself,

43:02.913 --> 43:04.181
there's nobody that
could fucking help you.

43:04.181 --> 43:05.716
You have to fix that.

43:05.716 --> 43:09.853
Everything is because of what
somebody else came up with.

43:09.853 --> 43:13.958
Just for a minute, can't
we at least entertain,

43:13.958 --> 43:16.026
maybe those ideas are wrong.

43:16.026 --> 43:17.161
An intelligent thing,

43:17.161 --> 43:20.631
not just a vast
universe of randomness,

43:21.765 --> 43:24.868
consciously created this
world to be what it is,

43:24.868 --> 43:26.971
and that's why everything
makes so much sense.

43:26.971 --> 43:30.274
You came here
early today, again,

43:31.942 --> 43:33.711
because what, you're bored?

43:37.915 --> 43:39.416
- I don't-
- You like coming here.

43:39.416 --> 43:42.186
You come here, you give me
shit, and you argue with me,

43:42.186 --> 43:45.823
but then you show up like
an hour early the next time.

43:45.823 --> 43:47.091
What does that tell you?

43:48.459 --> 43:51.161
- Well, maybe you don't have
enough patients on your books,

43:51.161 --> 43:53.163
and I'm just taking
advantage of it.

43:54.264 --> 43:55.199
- [Psychologist]
Well, no, I don't,

43:55.199 --> 43:56.433
because I try to focus on

43:56.433 --> 43:57.835
a smaller amount of
people at a time,

43:58.836 --> 44:00.204
and that's good for you.

44:00.204 --> 44:02.740
- Yeah, no, I, you know,

44:02.740 --> 44:05.909
I'll admit some of the
conversations we have,

44:05.909 --> 44:10.614
have been very inspiring.
- Cool, that's good to know.

44:10.614 --> 44:13.751
- Yeah, I like how I sound when
I talk to you too, you know?

44:13.751 --> 44:15.319
When I talk to my friends,

44:16.453 --> 44:18.455
I just don't get
to the places that,

44:19.556 --> 44:21.759
that I get to with
you, with them.

44:21.759 --> 44:24.628
If I get too upset, it's hard
for me to mean what I say,

44:24.628 --> 44:27.498
because I can't even
address the issue, yet.

44:28.599 --> 44:30.100
I work my way into it.
- You're so emotional.

44:31.235 --> 44:33.070
- I am really emotional.
- You actually seem like

44:33.070 --> 44:36.273
there's a flood of emotion
coming through your face,

44:36.273 --> 44:40.744
all day, you don't ever
seem like, just blank.

44:40.744 --> 44:42.579
You always seem very emotional.

44:42.579 --> 44:44.181
- I would never
wanna seem blank.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.549
- [Psychologist] I
know, that's great.

44:45.549 --> 44:46.884
I'm not saying it's bad,
but I'm just saying like,

44:46.884 --> 44:49.553
wow, you have a ton of emotion.

44:49.553 --> 44:51.889
I could see that when you're in,

44:51.889 --> 44:55.092
whatever relationship fights,
or conflicts, or whatever,

44:55.092 --> 45:00.164
that you probably really break
down and get really upset.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.034
You don't have moments of
weakness where you're like-

45:04.034 --> 45:08.072
- Of course, we have 20,000
thoughts a day, of course.

45:08.072 --> 45:09.473
Did you know that?

45:09.473 --> 45:10.641
Yeah.

45:10.641 --> 45:12.142
- [Psychologist] I
thought it was just me.

45:12.142 --> 45:15.512
- No, and we only utilize
this half of our brain,

45:15.512 --> 45:18.015
so why not reach
that other point?

45:18.015 --> 45:20.617
- I need to forgive the
younger me that's hurt.

45:20.617 --> 45:22.086
Even though, I'm
hurting as I'm older,

45:22.086 --> 45:23.821
but it's more of the younger
to me that's more hurt,

45:23.821 --> 45:25.422
that I have to let go
of, that's more scarred,

45:25.422 --> 45:27.224
'cause that was the
hardest part of my life.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.459
- Here, it's like,

45:28.459 --> 45:30.160
you're bringing it out
in me more and more,

45:30.160 --> 45:33.397
and I like that, and
I'm thriving in it,
and I wanna apply

45:33.397 --> 45:34.598
it to my life more.
- What happens now,

45:34.598 --> 45:36.567
when you go and talk
to other people,

45:36.567 --> 45:37.568
your friends and
stuff like that,

45:37.568 --> 45:39.570
who are not necessarily there?

45:39.570 --> 45:40.804
Do you try to get
them there, in turn?

45:40.804 --> 45:42.339
- Dude, I'm scared, you know?

45:42.339 --> 45:43.974
I wanna keep them as friends.

45:43.974 --> 45:47.911
I try to find clever ways
to implement whatever it is

45:47.911 --> 45:50.280
I think I'm learning
here, you know?

45:50.280 --> 45:51.515
- [Psychologist] But, do
you think that they'll have

45:51.515 --> 45:53.016
a harsh reaction to it?

45:53.016 --> 45:55.986
- If I were to just
straight forward be like,

45:57.821 --> 46:00.624
saying some of the concepts
we talk about here,

46:00.624 --> 46:03.393
just (blows air) right in,
no, it's not a good approach.

46:03.393 --> 46:08.198
They would be like, fuck you,
you're talking to some sadist,

46:08.198 --> 46:11.502
who has these extreme
ideas, da, da, da, da.

46:11.502 --> 46:13.904
But, I know that like, you
don't have extreme ideas,

46:13.904 --> 46:15.939
you're just pushing me
to think a certain way.

46:15.939 --> 46:17.574
- [Psychologist] Yeah, I mean,
I'm a normal person, right?

46:17.574 --> 46:20.244
- Yeah, it's hard for me to-
- Do you think I come across

46:20.244 --> 46:22.312
crazy with things
that I say and do?

46:22.312 --> 46:24.882
- I think some of the
things you say on purpose,

46:24.882 --> 46:28.585
to push me to think
a certain way,

46:28.585 --> 46:31.455
but I don't think
that you sound crazy.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.724
I might be naive,
maybe you are crazy.

46:33.724 --> 46:37.094
- [Psychologist] I think that
I come across so non-crazy,

46:37.094 --> 46:41.832
that I can get people to
open their minds to things

46:41.832 --> 46:45.636
that they never would have,
if somebody else said it.

46:45.636 --> 46:48.238
- I agree with that, and I'm
trying to replicate that.

46:48.238 --> 46:49.573
That's awesome.
- It's like, one of the

46:49.573 --> 46:51.642
best things I've
ever seen you do.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.776
- That's really cool.

46:53.577 --> 46:54.578
That's really cool.

46:56.513 --> 46:58.048
That's great feedback.

46:58.048 --> 46:59.583
- [Psychologist]
On human nature,

46:59.583 --> 47:01.051
let's go to the girl's side.

47:01.051 --> 47:03.754
Now, my premise on the
girl's side is following.

47:03.754 --> 47:05.255
- Okay.

47:05.255 --> 47:06.857
- [Psychologist] Girls, yes,
can be attracted to a guy

47:06.857 --> 47:10.427
physically just based on
looks or whatever, fine.

47:10.427 --> 47:13.997
But, I submit that that is
an exception to the rule,

47:13.997 --> 47:15.866
and that there's actually
a very low percentage of

47:15.866 --> 47:18.936
people/situations
that that happens in.

47:18.936 --> 47:21.438
I think that a girl needs,

47:21.438 --> 47:23.807
yes, needs a guy
to be good looking,

47:23.807 --> 47:26.510
but needs other things.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.912
Needs a deeper connection,
needs intelligence,

47:28.912 --> 47:31.281
needs a sense of
humor, need confidence.

47:31.281 --> 47:33.150
The guy's gotta have all
these things going for him,

47:33.150 --> 47:34.484
or at least some of
these things, whatever,

47:34.484 --> 47:36.486
something to find attractive.
- But, vice versa.

47:36.486 --> 47:38.522
Vice versa, know
that it's not just,

47:38.522 --> 47:40.424
he's gotta have this,
this, this, this, and this.

47:40.424 --> 47:42.359
I have to be carrying
all these, this, this,

47:42.359 --> 47:44.561
this things too, you know?

47:44.561 --> 47:47.564
- Coming from a person
who has explored,

47:47.564 --> 47:51.335
trying to be equal to men in
sexual aggression or whatever,

47:51.335 --> 47:53.070
needing to have sex a lot.

47:54.171 --> 47:55.839
Realizing that it
made me feel shitty,

47:55.839 --> 47:57.207
and it made me feel worthless,

47:57.207 --> 47:58.976
and that it just
really wasn't something

47:58.976 --> 48:01.745
I was capable of,
as hard as I tried

48:01.745 --> 48:04.815
to feel like I
could be that way.

48:04.815 --> 48:07.517
It was so against my nature,

48:07.517 --> 48:11.388
but I was supported in my
society, being told that,

48:11.388 --> 48:14.758
no, it's cool, be
the same as a man.

48:14.758 --> 48:17.661
You can behave the same
as him, and feel the same,

48:17.661 --> 48:20.330
and it's fine, that's
how it should be.

48:20.330 --> 48:25.402
But, really by pushing
women to try to be that way,

48:26.203 --> 48:27.804
you are breaking them down,

48:27.804 --> 48:30.340
because it is just
against their nature.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.075
It's not in their
best interests,

48:32.075 --> 48:35.078
and we're not capable
of it, we are just not.

48:35.078 --> 48:38.782
I've witnessed,
trying to inspire my
friends to be kind of,

48:38.782 --> 48:41.351
slutty, how uncomfortable
they become,

48:41.351 --> 48:43.787
and how unsure, and how unaware,

48:43.787 --> 48:47.858
and how vulnerable,
and broken they become.

48:48.992 --> 48:50.060
There I was thinking
I was helping them,

48:50.060 --> 48:51.895
but I was hurting them,

48:51.895 --> 48:55.065
because I thought that I had
figured out a way to have like,

48:55.065 --> 49:00.137
the same armor as men have
naturally, where we don't.

49:00.804 --> 49:02.339
What you're saying is,

49:02.339 --> 49:06.009
instead of giving
women no responsibility
for their actions,

49:06.009 --> 49:07.644
and saying, go fuck around.

49:07.644 --> 49:11.715
You can take a Plan B pill,
you can erase the baby.

49:11.715 --> 49:13.817
You're not responsible
for your bad decision.

49:13.817 --> 49:15.552
You can just abort it.

49:15.552 --> 49:18.021
Instead of that,
reminding them of,

49:18.021 --> 49:22.492
how sacred it is that
we get to have a baby,

49:22.492 --> 49:24.528
and that we are the
ones that create it,

49:24.528 --> 49:27.998
and we control the sperm,
being inside of us.

49:27.998 --> 49:30.133
If we actually go
back and think about,

49:30.133 --> 49:32.569
who are we gonna
let into our body?

49:32.569 --> 49:34.838
It's not that we
need to be prudes,

49:34.838 --> 49:36.740
and never let anyone
have sex with us,

49:36.740 --> 49:39.142
but take the subject
more seriously.

49:40.077 --> 49:41.812
Then, we can empower each other,

49:41.812 --> 49:45.849
by knowing we are the
biggest part of the puzzle.

49:45.849 --> 49:48.885
We are the most important
part of this equation,

49:48.885 --> 49:52.956
and we should not treat
ourselves like worthless,

49:52.956 --> 49:57.561
replaceable, trash
bins for semen.

49:58.962 --> 50:01.431
'Cause, if we're just the
sock that they come into,

50:01.431 --> 50:02.833
whenever they feel like it,

50:02.833 --> 50:04.434
then we're just a
dirty fucking sock

50:04.434 --> 50:07.604
that gets washed up,
and then renewed,

50:07.604 --> 50:08.939
but we're never the same.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.342
I think I understand that,

50:12.342 --> 50:15.979
and personally, I found
a place in my life where,

50:15.979 --> 50:18.148
I was disgusted with myself.

50:19.449 --> 50:21.184
Trying to have sex with people,

50:21.184 --> 50:22.886
that I didn't wanna
have sex with.

50:22.886 --> 50:25.322
I did put a halt to it,

50:25.322 --> 50:26.823
and it became really confusing

50:26.823 --> 50:28.291
for relationships I was having.

50:28.291 --> 50:31.795
People were saying, why
wouldn't you have sex with me?

50:31.795 --> 50:33.196
I'm like, 'cause I'm
not sure if I want to.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.599
And then, they didn't
wanna hang out anymore,

50:35.599 --> 50:38.368
and then I got to see
what the relationship was.

50:39.269 --> 50:40.704
Then, the moment I did decide to

50:40.704 --> 50:41.838
actually have sex with someone,

50:41.838 --> 50:44.341
because felt like it was right.

50:44.341 --> 50:47.911
Now, I'm in the most amazing
relationship I've ever had.

50:49.279 --> 50:52.849
Sex is different, it's never
been the way that it is, now.

50:54.317 --> 50:55.786
- Good for you.
- I think I understand.

50:55.786 --> 50:56.820
- [Psychologist] Good for you.

50:56.820 --> 50:57.721
Why are you here?

51:07.030 --> 51:11.301
- (blows raspberry)
I'm, you know,

51:14.638 --> 51:16.306
I think I'm having
a breakthrough.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.944
You make me have
breakthroughs, you know?

51:20.944 --> 51:22.412
- [Psychologist] Really.

51:22.412 --> 51:26.817
- Yeah, the stuff you say,
it's getting in there.
- [Psychologist] That's good.

51:28.718 --> 51:29.953
I would say, in general,

51:29.953 --> 51:34.858
I wouldn't let LA
adapt you too much.

51:35.992 --> 51:37.494
- No, right.
- You know what I'm saying?

51:37.494 --> 51:39.329
- No, totally, it's just
definitely opened my eyes

51:39.329 --> 51:43.266
to the things that I wouldn't
really be open to before.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.401
- [Psychologist] Okay.

51:44.401 --> 51:46.670
- But, I'm not like,

51:47.871 --> 51:50.173
I'm still gonna keep my,

51:50.974 --> 51:54.144
views pretty strict, in a sense,

51:54.144 --> 51:56.780
but I guess, open up
some doors to be like,

51:56.780 --> 52:00.717
oh, okay, okay, you know?

52:00.717 --> 52:03.186
For instance, I said like,

52:03.186 --> 52:06.857
I don't wanna go to Hollywood
or the Hills parties,

52:06.857 --> 52:08.091
and I think they're crazy,

52:08.091 --> 52:10.127
and they're filled
with a bunch of like,

52:10.127 --> 52:12.596
crazy people and drugs,
things of that nature.

52:12.596 --> 52:14.798
It was like, that's all
I've been doing all summer.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.066
- [Psychologist] Yeah,
but what if I just said,

52:16.066 --> 52:17.734
you can't come to me
anymore, that's it,

52:17.734 --> 52:19.569
this is the last time?

52:19.569 --> 52:21.905
Tonight is the last time.
- Then shit gets real.

52:21.905 --> 52:25.976
- I think we all have
that thought like,

52:25.976 --> 52:29.379
damn, bet you'd be nice in
bed, you know I'm saying?

52:29.379 --> 52:30.614
We all have that thought.

52:30.614 --> 52:32.149
- [Psychologist] Do
you have that thought?

52:32.149 --> 52:34.584
- Okay, you can't tell me
guys don't think that too.

52:34.584 --> 52:38.255
They're going to be like,
damn, you know what I'm saying?

52:38.255 --> 52:39.723
- [Psychologist] Let
me tell you what,

52:39.723 --> 52:44.161
with every single girl
who's above a seven, yes.

52:44.961 --> 52:47.764
All day, every day, absolutely.

52:47.764 --> 52:51.034
- Yeah, I might glance and
I'm like, they're cute,

52:52.402 --> 52:54.538
but I don't wanna pursue it
and that's the difference.

52:54.538 --> 52:56.273
It's like, thoughts
can be thought all day,

52:56.273 --> 52:57.908
but it's your actions.

52:57.908 --> 53:00.577
- You think I'm in the place
where I don't need you anymore?

53:00.577 --> 53:01.845
- [Psychologist] I
don't know, you tell me.

53:05.282 --> 53:07.017
- The reverse psychology thing.

53:08.118 --> 53:09.553
- A fucked up guy-
- Yeah, I heard

53:09.553 --> 53:10.620
he wasn't shit.

53:10.620 --> 53:13.190
Yeah, but, man, like I said,

53:14.591 --> 53:16.526
when you have a crazy guy,

53:16.526 --> 53:19.196
the woman has to be somewhat
crazy as well, you know?

53:19.196 --> 53:21.064
Especially, if you stick
around for as long as you do,

53:21.064 --> 53:23.366
and have a kid with somebody,
you know if somebody's crazy.

53:23.366 --> 53:27.504
My mom was crazy, so I had to
be real with myself initially.

53:27.504 --> 53:28.705
- [Psychologist] Well, I mean,

53:28.705 --> 53:31.107
they have to be crazy
or very insecure,

53:32.542 --> 53:35.178
attached to the relationship.
- That part, that part.

53:35.178 --> 53:36.580
- [Psychologist] You
know what I'm saying?

53:36.580 --> 53:39.349
Because, especially a
lot of women are like,

53:39.349 --> 53:42.352
battered women say, they're
not necessarily crazy,

53:42.352 --> 53:46.656
but they're like, kind
of just, you know,

53:46.656 --> 53:48.158
stuck to the relationship,

53:48.158 --> 53:50.227
because maybe they feel like
they can't do any better.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.929
Or, they're afraid to
leave, or whatever,

53:52.929 --> 53:54.130
you know what I mean?

53:54.130 --> 53:56.533
- Yeah, you're right,
no, you're right.

53:56.533 --> 53:58.802
You saying it right now,
I never thought of that.

53:58.802 --> 54:00.604
- [Psychologist] But, I'm
just saying, in general,

54:00.604 --> 54:03.306
I think that where
women go wrong is,

54:03.306 --> 54:08.178
that they don't have a good
finger on what they want.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.879
- I agree with that.

54:09.879 --> 54:11.114
- [Psychologist] You know?

54:11.114 --> 54:12.816
- I mean, some women do,
but a lot of us don't.

54:12.816 --> 54:14.317
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

54:14.317 --> 54:16.019
- It's funny, because I
look at it like this, right?

54:16.019 --> 54:17.354
I watched this
video it's called,

54:17.354 --> 54:19.222
this dude's talking
about fish love.

54:20.624 --> 54:23.026
I think about that in my
relationships and shit,

54:24.561 --> 54:26.229
and when you buy, when
you love someone, right?

54:26.229 --> 54:28.098
A guy goes fishing, right?

54:28.098 --> 54:29.532
Catches a fish, cooks
the fish, eat it,

54:29.532 --> 54:31.835
man, he said, oh my god,
I fucking love fish.

54:31.835 --> 54:33.036
Then God's like,
oh, you love fish?

54:33.036 --> 54:34.271
Yeah, I love fish.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.538
He says, so you love
fish, you kill it,

54:35.538 --> 54:37.207
you cook it, and you eat it,
so you love the fish, right?

54:37.207 --> 54:38.041
He said, yeah.

54:38.041 --> 54:39.309
He said, do you love the fish

54:39.309 --> 54:40.910
or do you love what
it does for you?

54:40.910 --> 54:44.047
A lot of time it's just fish
love we have for people.

54:44.047 --> 54:47.751
Do I love this woman,
because of what I see in her,

54:47.751 --> 54:49.185
and what she does
to make me happy?

54:49.185 --> 54:51.788
Not what I see in her truly.

54:51.788 --> 54:53.023
I remember when
we spoke earlier,

54:53.023 --> 54:54.057
and about being
selfish and shit,

54:54.057 --> 54:55.725
well, at the end of day,

54:55.725 --> 54:58.128
we're all doing for
us in something.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.663
Everything we do is for us.

54:59.663 --> 55:01.364
- [Psychologist] That's when
you know in a relationship,

55:01.364 --> 55:03.366
if somebody really
cares about you,

55:03.366 --> 55:06.636
they don't care about what
you're doing for them,

55:06.636 --> 55:07.937
they care about you,

55:07.937 --> 55:10.273
and what makes you
happy, your wellbeing.

55:11.541 --> 55:13.243
- That's the girl I have now.

55:13.243 --> 55:15.779
It's like that, but it's
hard for me to give back,

55:15.779 --> 55:18.848
when I ain't got shit to give,
because I don't know how to.

55:18.848 --> 55:20.116
- It's human nature.

55:20.116 --> 55:23.586
I'm not gonna, bash
on like, there's no,

55:23.586 --> 55:25.021
you can't help that, you
know what I'm saying?

55:25.021 --> 55:26.489
- [Psychologist] You
don't blame men for having

55:26.489 --> 55:29.559
sexual desires towards women
based strictly on looks?

55:29.559 --> 55:32.329
- No, just don't act on it.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.563
- [Psychologist] Okay, good.

55:33.563 --> 55:35.098
- I mean, it's one
of those things,

55:35.098 --> 55:36.933
it's not gonna go
away, that's just how,

55:36.933 --> 55:38.702
it's the way you think.

55:38.702 --> 55:40.537
It's the way you
think, so it's like,

55:40.537 --> 55:41.805
I could get pissed about
it all fucking day,

55:41.805 --> 55:44.741
but it's like, that's
how your brain works.

55:46.109 --> 55:47.711
We have a partial of it that
works that way sometimes,

55:47.711 --> 55:52.082
but majority of it is like,
we want more than that.

55:52.082 --> 55:54.217
- [Psychologist] You don't
seem like that kind of dude.

55:54.217 --> 55:55.752
- About not having shit to give?

55:55.752 --> 55:57.153
- [Psychologist] You seem
like a very compassionate

55:57.153 --> 55:58.755
and loving person.
- I am.

56:00.156 --> 56:01.424
- [Psychologist] Actually,
to tell you the truth,

56:01.424 --> 56:03.460
I'm surprised when
you tell me that,

56:03.460 --> 56:04.661
you didn't have a
mom in your life,

56:04.661 --> 56:06.363
because you seem like
the type of person

56:06.363 --> 56:07.764
who most definitely would.

56:07.764 --> 56:08.965
- Yeah.

56:08.965 --> 56:10.633
- [Psychologist] You
don't seem like a cold,

56:11.634 --> 56:13.737
all-business type of dude.

56:13.737 --> 56:16.272
You seem like a very
compassionate dude.

56:16.272 --> 56:18.508
I don't think I even
believe that that's true.

56:18.508 --> 56:21.111
Maybe you think
that about yourself,

56:21.111 --> 56:22.645
but I don't think
that's the reality.

56:22.645 --> 56:27.050
- Yes, I am having issues
sleeping, lots of anxiety.

56:28.718 --> 56:30.353
- [Psychologist]
Anxiety about what?

56:31.921 --> 56:33.623
- About my own experiences,

56:33.623 --> 56:36.526
and I need to wipe the
slate clean so I can...

56:38.361 --> 56:39.796
- [Psychologist] You're
having general anxiety,

56:39.796 --> 56:41.898
or is there specific-
- I'm having anxiety, yeah,

56:41.898 --> 56:45.935
and I need to find
a way to combat,

56:45.935 --> 56:48.438
if you can help me find
a way to combat anxiety,

56:48.438 --> 56:53.510
maybe some tools that I can
take home, so that I can sleep.

56:54.844 --> 56:56.012
- [Psychologist] ...a
very warm, compassionate,

56:56.012 --> 56:57.480
loving dude, I can tell.

56:57.480 --> 57:02.485
I've met some cold, horrible
fucking people, dude, trust me.

57:03.853 --> 57:06.122
I have met some horrible,
cold, fucking sociopath,

57:06.122 --> 57:08.324
fucking horrible people,

57:08.324 --> 57:09.559
and you don't fall
into that category.

57:09.559 --> 57:10.960
- I appreciate it.
- I think you should

57:10.960 --> 57:14.831
keep in mind that, you
do have that to offer,

57:14.831 --> 57:16.299
you're probably just
not aware of it.

57:16.299 --> 57:17.567
You probably think that,

57:17.567 --> 57:19.302
because you've had that
situation with your mom,

57:19.302 --> 57:21.204
that maybe you're
not capable of it.

57:21.204 --> 57:23.373
Well, I would need to know
what the problem is first,

57:23.373 --> 57:25.141
and so would you.

57:25.141 --> 57:26.609
- Okay.

57:26.609 --> 57:27.911
- [Psychologist] Maybe we
should try to figure that out?

57:27.911 --> 57:28.812
- Okay.

57:30.013 --> 57:31.181
- [Psychologist] You
know what we need to do,

57:31.181 --> 57:32.382
in order to do that?
- What's that?

57:32.382 --> 57:34.651
- [Psychologist]
You have to be open.

57:34.651 --> 57:35.985
- I am open, I am here.

57:37.086 --> 57:38.021
- [Psychologist] Just
because you're here,

57:38.021 --> 57:39.289
doesn't mean you're open.

57:39.289 --> 57:42.025
You have to be open
to discussing things

57:42.025 --> 57:43.960
that might make you
uncomfortable to talk about,

57:43.960 --> 57:45.094
or even think about.

57:46.696 --> 57:47.597
- Okay.

57:48.932 --> 57:51.468
- [Psychologist] So you're
down, that sounds good to you?

57:51.468 --> 57:52.368
You sure?

57:54.737 --> 57:56.940
- I said yes.

57:56.940 --> 57:58.575
- [Psychologist]
For me, it's not,

57:59.709 --> 58:03.179
I just don't like where it's at.

58:03.179 --> 58:04.547
I just don't like how it goes.

58:04.547 --> 58:06.049
I don't like that you-

58:06.049 --> 58:10.820
- I feel like you don't
trust me, and that sucks.

58:11.621 --> 58:12.856
- [Psychologist] In what way?

58:12.856 --> 58:14.324
- You don't give me the
benefit of the doubt.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.192
- [Psychologist] You're so
hostile, why are you hostile?

58:17.594 --> 58:20.864
- I don't think that
that is accurate.

58:20.864 --> 58:22.632
I've been bending over
backwards for you.

58:22.632 --> 58:23.900
Do you understand that?

58:23.900 --> 58:25.635
Your case is a very,
very difficult case,

58:25.635 --> 58:27.103
and you don't look very good.

58:27.103 --> 58:28.404
- [Psychologist] No, you
don't think you're hostile?

58:28.404 --> 58:29.806
- No, I don't.
- You're a little defensive.

58:29.806 --> 58:31.674
- Why are you calling
me, why are you saying?

58:31.674 --> 58:32.909
- [Psychologist] See, look,

58:32.909 --> 58:34.544
you're defensive and
hostile right now.

58:34.544 --> 58:36.980
- What is the point
in telling me that?

58:36.980 --> 58:39.582
- [Psychologist] So that you
know, so you stop doing it.

58:39.582 --> 58:42.018
- My job is to get
the truth across.

58:42.018 --> 58:44.420
My job is to make
sure that you...

58:46.022 --> 58:47.390
Excuse me?

58:48.725 --> 58:50.727
Mr. Bolton, you can not
speak to me that way,

58:50.727 --> 58:51.961
I will not allow it.

58:51.961 --> 58:54.197
Okay, why don't
you give me tools,

58:56.132 --> 58:58.334
so that I can-
- I'm trying to

58:58.334 --> 59:01.371
give you tools, by
you giving me tools.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.239
- Don't you dare
talk to me that way.

59:03.239 --> 59:05.508
I have bent over
backwards for this case,

59:05.508 --> 59:07.110
and you clearly are not

59:07.110 --> 59:09.012
appreciating anything
that I've done.

59:09.012 --> 59:11.047
That is absolutely not true.

59:12.582 --> 59:14.984
I have a huge stake
in this company.

59:16.119 --> 59:18.488
Our reputation is golden,

59:18.488 --> 59:20.557
which is more than
I can say for yours.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.626
- [Psychologist] I need to
know what the problem is.

59:24.427 --> 59:25.895
- You don't look very good,

59:25.895 --> 59:28.031
and there are a lot of
people who don't like you.

59:30.700 --> 59:31.734
Don't like me?

59:31.734 --> 59:33.136
I told you what my problem was-

59:33.136 --> 59:34.604
- [Psychologist] No, you didn't.

59:34.604 --> 59:37.307
You said, you told me-
- I have some issues in my

59:37.307 --> 59:38.975
past that I need
to work through,

59:38.975 --> 59:40.376
and do you need
to know my issues?

59:40.376 --> 59:42.845
No, you said, no, in the
beginning of this conversation,

59:42.845 --> 59:44.881
you said, let's not go there.

59:44.881 --> 59:46.716
- [Psychologist] I said,
let's not go there yet.

59:46.716 --> 59:49.052
- If you feel that way,
then you can go elsewhere.

59:49.052 --> 59:51.621
(phone slams)

1:00:03.533 --> 1:00:07.036
(computer keys clicking)

1:00:21.384 --> 1:00:24.354
- When you say confident people,

1:00:26.422 --> 1:00:30.093
'cause I see a lot of what
appears to be confident,

1:00:30.093 --> 1:00:31.894
but then when you
really break it down,

1:00:31.894 --> 1:00:33.329
it's a bit of a mask.

1:00:33.329 --> 1:00:35.565
I feel like a lot of
people are wearing masks.

1:00:35.565 --> 1:00:37.300
- Almost all of the time.
- What is confident?

1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:38.968
What do you define
confidence as?

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:40.737
- [Psychologist] I
define confident as,

1:00:40.737 --> 1:00:42.872
you don't need to
wear a fucking mask.

1:00:42.872 --> 1:00:46.476
Is that, you can be yourself
all the fucking time,

1:00:46.476 --> 1:00:49.078
and be completely fine with it.

1:00:49.078 --> 1:00:51.447
You don't need to bring
other people down,

1:00:51.447 --> 1:00:54.917
and try to insult somebody
else or hurt somebody else,

1:00:54.917 --> 1:00:57.787
to feel good about yourself,
'cause you don't need that.

1:00:57.787 --> 1:00:59.455
That's the real confidence.
- You feel like that means

1:00:59.455 --> 1:01:01.557
someone that knows themselves?

1:01:01.557 --> 1:01:02.792
Would you say?
- Yeah, you have to

1:01:02.792 --> 1:01:04.394
know yourself to
be able to do that.

1:01:04.394 --> 1:01:05.928
You're not telling me
what the problem is,

1:01:05.928 --> 1:01:08.297
you're telling me how the
problem is manifesting.

1:01:08.297 --> 1:01:10.066
You saying that you can't sleep,

1:01:11.367 --> 1:01:13.603
I'm not gonna just give
you Ambien, and be like,

1:01:13.603 --> 1:01:14.937
go ahead, get a
good night's sleep.

1:01:14.937 --> 1:01:16.072
We have to find out

1:01:16.072 --> 1:01:18.408
why you're here.
- I already have Ambien.

1:01:18.408 --> 1:01:19.976
- [Psychologist] Your problem
is not that you can't sleep,

1:01:19.976 --> 1:01:22.178
the problem is what's causing
you to not be able to sleep.

1:01:22.178 --> 1:01:24.080
- Yes, I would like
to have some tools.

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:25.448
- Right, and you're right,

1:01:25.448 --> 1:01:28.084
like they say, hurt
people hurt people.

1:01:28.084 --> 1:01:31.054
I think a lot of the time when
I spoke, I quote, unquote,

1:01:31.054 --> 1:01:32.922
I was shopping hungry.

1:01:32.922 --> 1:01:35.158
Like they say, don't
ever shop hungry,

1:01:35.158 --> 1:01:36.693
'cause you'll buy the shit
that you'll eat right now,

1:01:36.693 --> 1:01:38.928
and you won't think longevity.

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:42.565
I'm in a state of anger, so
when I'm happy of course,

1:01:42.565 --> 1:01:44.667
it's like people say,
oh, I wanna kill myself.

1:01:44.667 --> 1:01:47.070
Of course you wanna kill
yourself in your lower state,

1:01:47.070 --> 1:01:48.304
feel the greatest you?

1:01:48.304 --> 1:01:49.639
You won't ever think
about killing yourself,

1:01:49.639 --> 1:01:51.908
it's just, it's in
the mode, right?

1:01:51.908 --> 1:01:53.543
You're right, I'm hurt
like a motherfucker.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:55.278
- 'Cause, I think we have
moments where you like,

1:01:55.278 --> 1:01:56.979
really believe in
me, and you're like,

1:01:56.979 --> 1:01:57.980
she's fucking awesome.

1:01:57.980 --> 1:01:59.682
And then, you're
like, more time-

1:01:59.682 --> 1:02:00.950
- [Psychologist] 'Cause
you keep slipping.

1:02:00.950 --> 1:02:03.319
You keep going off, you
don't stay consistent.

1:02:03.319 --> 1:02:04.987
Actually, that's funny
that you say that,

1:02:04.987 --> 1:02:06.422
because you're right.

1:02:06.422 --> 1:02:08.891
Because, I actually,
consciously had the thought,

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:12.161
yesterday or whatever it was,
that you're not consistent.

1:02:12.161 --> 1:02:13.896
That's why I said to you
on the phone the other day,

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:15.798
I'm like, did I lose you,
are you still with me?

1:02:15.798 --> 1:02:17.734
- Right, okay, but this
is what's so weird.

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:19.869
For me, I'm all in.

1:02:19.869 --> 1:02:22.004
- [Psychologist] From my end,

1:02:22.004 --> 1:02:23.973
I don't know if we're
quite there yet.

1:02:25.274 --> 1:02:28.978
- I mean, I still got some
wrinkles I'm straightening out.

1:02:28.978 --> 1:02:31.647
- [Psychologist]
(chuckles) Just some?

1:02:31.647 --> 1:02:33.783
- I mean, okay, the
paper's crumbled, okay?

1:02:33.783 --> 1:02:38.855
But, it's like, pull it
out, iron it a little bit.

1:02:39.989 --> 1:02:41.190
- [Psychologist] Oh,
isn't that a saying?

1:02:41.190 --> 1:02:42.658
That once the paper
is crumpled up,

1:02:42.658 --> 1:02:44.160
it can't be perfect again?

1:02:45.228 --> 1:02:47.530
You felt powerless
with your mom,

1:02:47.530 --> 1:02:49.398
because you couldn't
control that.

1:02:49.398 --> 1:02:50.900
You couldn't get
her to come back,

1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:53.269
you couldn't get her to love
you, and take care of you,

1:02:53.269 --> 1:02:54.771
and all this kind of stuff.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:56.672
You couldn't get her to
do this, you had no power.

1:02:56.672 --> 1:02:59.542
- What we need in the world,
is women to be strong,

1:02:59.542 --> 1:03:02.678
because the man always
looks up to the woman.

1:03:02.678 --> 1:03:04.747
As a kid, the kid, boy,

1:03:04.747 --> 1:03:08.384
is always gonna look up to
the woman as the role model.

1:03:08.384 --> 1:03:12.121
Therefore, a man actually needs
a woman to show him the way.

1:03:12.989 --> 1:03:16.626
(acoustic guitar music)

1:05:07.136 --> 1:05:08.871
- I hate hypocrites.

1:05:08.871 --> 1:05:13.943
I hate people that project
an illusion of their persona,

1:05:15.311 --> 1:05:17.380
and then fucking go back on
it, because it's bullshit.

1:05:18.514 --> 1:05:20.049
'Cause they're fucking liars.

1:05:20.049 --> 1:05:23.252
They stand there and they
say, that they love this,

1:05:23.252 --> 1:05:25.821
and they appreciate this,
and this is so fucking great.

1:05:25.821 --> 1:05:27.256
And then, they
turn to your face.

1:05:27.256 --> 1:05:30.192
and they abandoned every
fucking thing they just said.

1:05:30.192 --> 1:05:31.727
- [Psychologist] And I like you,

1:05:31.727 --> 1:05:33.829
but you're a fucking
pain in the ass, dude.

1:05:33.829 --> 1:05:36.499
- No.
- You are, you fucking are.

1:05:36.499 --> 1:05:40.036
- I think that, I think,
no, honestly, look,

1:05:40.036 --> 1:05:43.239
I listen to everything that
you say, and I take it in.

1:05:43.239 --> 1:05:45.241
- [Psychologist] Well, you
haven't seen me in a long time,

1:05:45.241 --> 1:05:47.576
and I think maybe you
need to see me more often.

1:05:47.576 --> 1:05:49.111
- I knew you thought that.
- 'Cause, you fucking lost

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:51.113
your shit, you did.

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:52.782
You need somebody in your life

1:05:52.782 --> 1:05:54.216
who's gonna straighten you out,

1:05:54.216 --> 1:05:57.553
because I know that you
have, the situation where you

1:05:57.553 --> 1:05:59.655
didn't really have a
father figure in your life.

1:05:59.655 --> 1:06:01.157
I know that you either-
- You know too much.

1:06:01.157 --> 1:06:03.960
I don't give a fuck about
the little person I created.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.227
She can go off,

1:06:05.227 --> 1:06:06.729
and do whatever the fuck
she wants with her life,

1:06:06.729 --> 1:06:08.931
and I don't care.

1:06:08.931 --> 1:06:12.168
- [Psychologist] I think you
need to figure out what to do,

1:06:12.168 --> 1:06:14.603
and what is important
and what's not.

1:06:14.603 --> 1:06:15.871
Find the things that aren't,

1:06:15.871 --> 1:06:17.273
and put those things
on the back burner.

1:06:17.273 --> 1:06:18.574
- I do not disagree.
- You need to like,

1:06:18.574 --> 1:06:20.409
consciously figure out,

1:06:20.409 --> 1:06:22.144
this is what I need
to spend time on.

1:06:22.144 --> 1:06:23.412
This is what I need to focus on,

1:06:23.412 --> 1:06:24.947
and this is what is
gonna waste my time.

1:06:24.947 --> 1:06:27.616
- Take responsibility for
your fucking having a kid.

1:06:28.517 --> 1:06:29.785
You have three.

1:06:29.785 --> 1:06:30.886
- [Psychologist] Why
do you have anxiety?

1:06:30.886 --> 1:06:32.321
What are you worried about?

1:06:35.658 --> 1:06:38.728
- Are you asking me what
happened or, I don't understand.

1:06:38.728 --> 1:06:41.330
- [Psychologist] Well,
however you wanna answer me.

1:06:41.330 --> 1:06:42.798
Why do you have anxiety?

1:06:42.798 --> 1:06:44.500
What are you sad about,
what are you worried about,

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.135
what's the problem?

1:06:49.505 --> 1:06:50.673
- I,

1:06:51.774 --> 1:06:54.910
have had issues

1:06:54.910 --> 1:06:57.046
and situations in the past

1:06:57.046 --> 1:07:01.650
that have led me to
not be able to sleep.

1:07:04.453 --> 1:07:05.888
It is a trigger.

1:07:05.888 --> 1:07:07.123
- [Psychologist] Do you
wanna tell me what those are?

1:07:07.123 --> 1:07:09.325
- I take you very seriously.

1:07:09.325 --> 1:07:11.961
And even if there's time in
between us seeing each other,

1:07:11.961 --> 1:07:14.530
I think of like, what
you've said to me or-

1:07:14.530 --> 1:07:15.931
- [Psychologist] I get
disappointed, I'm like,

1:07:15.931 --> 1:07:18.200
dude, I thought I had a
positive influence on this girl.

1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:19.435
I do (muffled speaking).
- I try to be

1:07:19.435 --> 1:07:21.504
so reflective, too.
- Isn't it weird?

1:07:21.504 --> 1:07:22.805
- Yes, that's sad.
- We have a

1:07:22.805 --> 1:07:24.006
very strange relationship,

1:07:24.006 --> 1:07:25.641
because I feel like-
- I wanna talk.

1:07:25.641 --> 1:07:27.610
- [Psychologist] As
part of this thing,

1:07:27.610 --> 1:07:29.879
I'm trying to be a
positive influence

1:07:29.879 --> 1:07:31.547
on you in many ways, right?

1:07:32.782 --> 1:07:34.750
But, sometimes I'm
like, dude, and then,

1:07:34.750 --> 1:07:36.285
I'm like, oh, that's awesome.

1:07:36.285 --> 1:07:38.587
And then, something
happens, and then I'm like,

1:07:38.587 --> 1:07:40.656
oh, that sucks.

1:07:40.656 --> 1:07:42.491
I'm disappointed-
- But, isn't there any

1:07:42.491 --> 1:07:44.860
side of that that can
be your responsibility,

1:07:44.860 --> 1:07:46.695
of the fact that you
keep doubting me,

1:07:46.695 --> 1:07:48.597
and I'm not actually changing.

1:07:48.597 --> 1:07:51.700
- I can tell you what's, I
can tell you what's going on.

1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:52.868
- [Psychologist]
Are you comfortable?

1:07:53.936 --> 1:07:55.304
- I'm uncomfortable,
I've never been

1:07:55.304 --> 1:07:56.705
in this scenario before,

1:07:56.705 --> 1:07:58.641
but if that's what
needs to happen

1:07:58.641 --> 1:08:02.211
in order for you to help
me, then I will do it.

1:08:02.211 --> 1:08:03.345
- [Psychologist] Well,
we have to start with

1:08:03.345 --> 1:08:04.280
you being comfortable.

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:05.514
We don't want you to feel like

1:08:05.514 --> 1:08:06.882
you're doing something
you don't wanna do.

1:08:06.882 --> 1:08:09.618
- Okay, well, I
don't, this is new,

1:08:10.719 --> 1:08:12.588
and I was told that
you could help me.

1:08:12.588 --> 1:08:14.290
And so far, you're
not helping me,

1:08:14.290 --> 1:08:16.625
you're calling me hostile,
and you're calling-

1:08:16.625 --> 1:08:18.427
- All right, relax.
- Calling me defensive.

1:08:18.427 --> 1:08:22.131
- [Psychologist] Relax,
relax, let me talk.

1:08:22.131 --> 1:08:23.599
You don't mind me saying to you,

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:24.867
dude, you're fucked up,

1:08:24.867 --> 1:08:26.936
because this blah,
blah, blah, right?

1:08:26.936 --> 1:08:27.937
Or, do you?

1:08:29.338 --> 1:08:31.607
- You said, that I fucked
up or that I am fucked up?

1:08:31.607 --> 1:08:33.008
- [Psychologist] Both,
neither, whatever.

1:08:33.008 --> 1:08:35.111
- I mean, I don't love
that you're saying that.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:36.345
- [Psychologist] I'm not saying

1:08:36.345 --> 1:08:37.613
you're fucked up as a
person, I'm saying like,

1:08:37.613 --> 1:08:38.614
whatever I'm saying.
- No, I see truth

1:08:38.614 --> 1:08:40.116
in what you're saying,

1:08:40.116 --> 1:08:42.384
'cause I'm frustrated with
my lifestyle right now.

1:08:42.384 --> 1:08:43.819
I have-
- Yeah, you seem like a mess,

1:08:43.819 --> 1:08:45.521
you seem like you're
all over the place.

1:08:45.521 --> 1:08:47.423
Obviously, you haven't been
to a psychologist before,

1:08:47.423 --> 1:08:51.827
but the groundwork is, I
need to know about you.

1:08:51.827 --> 1:08:53.329
I need to know what you think.

1:08:53.329 --> 1:08:54.930
I need to know how you feel.

1:08:54.930 --> 1:08:57.600
I need to know what your
experiences were, good and bad,

1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:00.903
and I need to know what
you think the problem is.

1:09:02.705 --> 1:09:04.540
So yes, you're being
defensive and hostile,

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:06.442
when I ask you these questions.

1:09:06.442 --> 1:09:10.479
I think maybe, that's
where I'm going wrong.

1:09:10.479 --> 1:09:12.848
I'm not explaining to
you what the process is.

1:09:12.848 --> 1:09:15.484
Now, that I've explained
to you what the process is,

1:09:15.484 --> 1:09:18.954
I need you to open up
to me a little bit,

1:09:18.954 --> 1:09:22.391
and answer some questions
that I have about you.

1:09:25.127 --> 1:09:26.061
- Okay.

1:09:26.061 --> 1:09:27.830
- No, but you're so direct.

1:09:27.830 --> 1:09:29.465
That, you're asking
me, is it okay?

1:09:29.465 --> 1:09:31.133
I'm like, yeah.

1:09:31.133 --> 1:09:31.967
- [Psychologist] Yeah.

1:09:31.967 --> 1:09:33.202
- Yeah.

1:09:33.202 --> 1:09:34.436
- [Psychologist] So
you're okay with that?

1:09:34.436 --> 1:09:35.504
But, you're okay with
that on every level,

1:09:35.504 --> 1:09:36.705
or you're okay with that,

1:09:36.705 --> 1:09:38.507
with just setting
appointments and shit?

1:09:38.507 --> 1:09:40.242
- What other levels are there?

1:09:40.242 --> 1:09:41.877
- [Psychologist] Level 3.

1:09:41.877 --> 1:09:43.812
- Ha, ha. That's clever.
- The whole thing,

1:09:43.812 --> 1:09:46.515
the everything, the
everything that you are.

1:09:47.516 --> 1:09:49.118
The first question I have is,

1:09:49.118 --> 1:09:52.154
why do you think that
you have anxiety?

1:09:57.059 --> 1:09:59.195
- I have anxiety,

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:02.064
because of,

1:10:02.064 --> 1:10:03.632
something that happened

1:10:06.268 --> 1:10:07.870
several years ago.

1:10:07.870 --> 1:10:09.004
- [Psychologist] I know,
but I'm saying, in general,

1:10:09.004 --> 1:10:10.439
you're very defensive.

1:10:11.774 --> 1:10:13.876
Is it the weird
fucking thing, okay,

1:10:13.876 --> 1:10:15.678
so when I called you
up and told you that,

1:10:15.678 --> 1:10:17.446
what was your reaction to that?

1:10:17.446 --> 1:10:18.447
- My feelings were hurt.

1:10:18.447 --> 1:10:20.249
- [Psychologist] Why?

1:10:20.249 --> 1:10:22.585
- You said you were
disappointed in me.

1:10:22.585 --> 1:10:24.653
- [Psychologist] What happened?

1:10:24.653 --> 1:10:26.855
- I was,

1:10:28.791 --> 1:10:29.892
I was,

1:10:32.561 --> 1:10:34.163
I was drugged and raped.

1:10:37.032 --> 1:10:37.933
- [Psychologist] Really?

1:10:40.669 --> 1:10:43.405
What ended up happening,
did you go to the police,

1:10:43.405 --> 1:10:45.574
or did anything happen?
- I did not.

1:10:45.574 --> 1:10:46.508
- You didn't?
- No.

1:10:46.508 --> 1:10:47.376
- [Psychologist] Why not?

1:10:48.611 --> 1:10:50.045
- Conflict of interest.

1:10:51.380 --> 1:10:52.481
- [Psychologist] How?

1:10:53.649 --> 1:10:55.651
- He was a friend of
my boss at the time.

1:10:57.052 --> 1:10:59.755
- [Psychologist] Now, when
you do or say something,

1:11:00.756 --> 1:11:04.493
that I feel like is off the path

1:11:04.493 --> 1:11:08.330
of where I'm trying
to help you go,

1:11:08.330 --> 1:11:10.032
it really bothers me.

1:11:11.367 --> 1:11:16.005
It really, that's what I'm
saying, it bothers me too much.

1:11:17.373 --> 1:11:21.043
I shouldn't be, or maybe I
shouldn't be that bothered,

1:11:22.144 --> 1:11:23.312
and then what's the
solution to that?

1:11:24.913 --> 1:11:27.883
What do I do about that, what
do I do with that, you know?

1:11:28.817 --> 1:11:30.419
What do I fucking do about that?

1:11:33.289 --> 1:11:37.192
- I don't know, well, you
talked to me about it.

1:11:37.192 --> 1:11:38.861
I don't know if that
made you feel better,

1:11:38.861 --> 1:11:41.530
but what did I do?

1:11:41.530 --> 1:11:43.098
How did I piss you off?

1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.201
- [Psychologist] You see
him again after that?

1:11:46.201 --> 1:11:48.871
- I have seen him, twice.

1:11:48.871 --> 1:11:50.839
- [Psychologist]
How did that go?

1:11:50.839 --> 1:11:52.775
- I did not talk to him.

1:11:52.775 --> 1:11:54.476
- [Psychologist] Did
he try to talk to you?

1:11:55.344 --> 1:11:56.812
- No.

1:11:56.812 --> 1:11:58.814
- [Psychologist] I wish you
would just fucking listen to me.

1:11:58.814 --> 1:12:00.816
- I do listen to you.

1:12:00.816 --> 1:12:02.084
- [Psychologist]
You kind of don't.

1:12:03.252 --> 1:12:05.521
- (sighs) I don't
view it that way.

1:12:07.056 --> 1:12:10.092
- [Psychologist] Was it like
you were already kind of,

1:12:10.092 --> 1:12:13.028
romantically involved a
little bit or was it just-

1:12:13.028 --> 1:12:15.130
- No, no, I was
not, no, I wasn't.

1:12:15.130 --> 1:12:16.131
- [Psychologist] You
weren't even interested-

1:12:16.131 --> 1:12:17.733
- No, I was not, no, I was not.

1:12:17.733 --> 1:12:19.234
- [Psychologist] You
weren't on a date with him?

1:12:19.234 --> 1:12:21.770
- No, I didn't, I was not on
a date, it was at a party.

1:12:21.770 --> 1:12:24.873
- I'm sorry that
I've disappointed you
or frustrated you,

1:12:24.873 --> 1:12:29.812
but I don't, I don't
know what to say.

1:12:29.812 --> 1:12:31.313
It's real life,

1:12:33.015 --> 1:12:34.550
I am who I am.

1:12:36.952 --> 1:12:39.188
- [Psychologist]
You were at a party,

1:12:39.188 --> 1:12:41.757
and the next thing you know,

1:12:41.757 --> 1:12:42.991
you wake up somewhere,

1:12:46.562 --> 1:12:47.463
with the guy?

1:12:51.066 --> 1:12:53.369
- He was actually, he was just,

1:12:56.071 --> 1:12:57.606
he was there, I saw him, yes.

1:12:59.341 --> 1:13:01.543
- [Psychologist] You
didn't wake up like during,

1:13:02.378 --> 1:13:03.612
when it was happening?

1:13:03.612 --> 1:13:04.913
- It's very, very hazy.

1:13:04.913 --> 1:13:06.749
There are moments
I was in and out,

1:13:06.749 --> 1:13:08.183
especially in the beginning.

1:13:16.825 --> 1:13:18.660
- [Psychologist] How
do you feel like,

1:13:19.928 --> 1:13:21.663
you would wanna handle that?

1:13:21.663 --> 1:13:22.931
Would you wanna
have him arrested,

1:13:22.931 --> 1:13:24.166
or would you wanna have
something happen to him,

1:13:24.166 --> 1:13:26.568
or you don't think it
would make a difference?

1:13:26.568 --> 1:13:28.837
- I do not think it
would make a difference.

1:13:30.305 --> 1:13:31.507
- I'm just so frustrated,

1:13:31.507 --> 1:13:33.142
because I really thought
that you were like,

1:13:33.142 --> 1:13:36.111
seeing me for who I
am, and you don't!

1:13:36.111 --> 1:13:38.147
You think I'm some
piece of shit,

1:13:38.147 --> 1:13:41.016
and it's so frustrating,
'cause I'm not.

1:13:41.016 --> 1:13:43.952
I'm not perfect,
sometimes I get confused

1:13:43.952 --> 1:13:46.288
if people are sexualizing
me in their head,

1:13:46.288 --> 1:13:49.391
and I'm like, no, I'm
just here for business.

1:13:49.391 --> 1:13:52.428
But, people are
always sexualizing me,

1:13:52.428 --> 1:13:53.362
and maybe it's just in my head,

1:13:53.362 --> 1:13:54.496
maybe that's just what I think.

1:13:54.496 --> 1:13:55.764
- It wouldn't make a difference,

1:13:55.764 --> 1:13:57.800
there are so many
of them out there.

1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:00.002
- [Psychologist] But,
maybe you do that,

1:14:00.002 --> 1:14:01.370
so he can't do it
to somebody else.

1:14:01.370 --> 1:14:02.638
- It's too late, I'm a lawyer,

1:14:02.638 --> 1:14:04.940
and I know that I don't
have a case against him

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:05.874
at this point.

1:14:05.874 --> 1:14:07.843
I have zero evidence whatsoever.

1:14:13.482 --> 1:14:14.483
- [Psychologist] Wow.

1:14:16.318 --> 1:14:19.321
I do really, really
care about you,

1:14:19.321 --> 1:14:21.657
and just, you know,
to hear you say that,

1:14:21.657 --> 1:14:23.926
just, I can't, stop,
don't say that.

1:14:24.893 --> 1:14:26.228
I just can't hear that.

1:14:29.731 --> 1:14:31.033
You think about it a lot?

1:14:32.568 --> 1:14:34.736
- Not while I'm working.

1:14:34.736 --> 1:14:38.974
Fortunately, I'm very
busy, but that is why,

1:14:40.576 --> 1:14:44.913
I need some tools to
help me in the evening,

1:14:44.913 --> 1:14:49.985
because that's, that's
when I think about it.

1:14:51.987 --> 1:14:54.122
- [Psychologist] I do think
you're a fucking good person.

1:14:54.122 --> 1:14:56.124
I could see that
you're a good person,

1:14:56.124 --> 1:15:00.596
but I could also see that
you're, very vulnerable,

1:15:00.596 --> 1:15:03.599
you're like the most vulnerable
person I've ever known.

1:15:03.599 --> 1:15:05.067
I mean, my thing would be that,

1:15:05.067 --> 1:15:07.669
you would have to
confront that situation.

1:15:09.037 --> 1:15:11.773
That you would have to face
that, and not try to bury it,

1:15:11.773 --> 1:15:13.242
and not think about it,

1:15:13.242 --> 1:15:16.011
but you have to come to
terms with it for yourself.

1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:21.550
- Okay, I don't know,
how do you do that?

1:15:21.550 --> 1:15:23.552
I don't really know.
- Well, I mean,

1:15:23.552 --> 1:15:26.088
that takes time, it's
a pretty serious thing,

1:15:26.088 --> 1:15:27.222
but there's a lot of things

1:15:27.222 --> 1:15:30.526
that can happen
psychologically to you,

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:31.927
after something
like that happens.

1:15:31.927 --> 1:15:35.364
You could think in some
way it's your fault.

1:15:35.364 --> 1:15:37.299
You can resent men.

1:15:37.299 --> 1:15:38.700
- I do not think it's my fault.

1:15:38.700 --> 1:15:40.469
- [Psychologist] No,
I know, I'm saying,

1:15:40.469 --> 1:15:42.538
these are things
that could happen,

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:45.274
when that happens to someone.

1:15:45.274 --> 1:15:49.211
- I just wanna make you not
disappointed me anymore.

1:15:52.447 --> 1:15:54.783
But, I'm just making
you frustrated.

1:16:01.823 --> 1:16:03.592
- [Psychologist] You could feel
like you're always on guard.

1:16:03.592 --> 1:16:05.460
You could feel like
you're always trying to,

1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:06.962
keep people at a distance,

1:16:06.962 --> 1:16:10.065
that you're kind of afraid
to be in certain situations.

1:16:10.065 --> 1:16:13.001
I mean, there's a lot of
things that can come of that.

1:16:13.001 --> 1:16:17.839
The first thing would be to
kind of, as hard as it is,

1:16:17.839 --> 1:16:21.910
try to not bury it,
and try to face it,

1:16:21.910 --> 1:16:25.314
and figure out how you feel
about it, how you look at it.

1:16:25.314 --> 1:16:26.848
- I know how I feel about it.

1:16:26.848 --> 1:16:28.383
- [Psychologist] Tell me,
how do you feel about it?

1:16:28.383 --> 1:16:31.486
- I am very, I am angry
about it, of course.

1:16:31.486 --> 1:16:33.422
I don't think anyone has
the right to do that.

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:37.025
Men do not have the right
to do that, to women.

1:16:40.462 --> 1:16:41.797
- [Psychologist] I agree.

1:16:41.797 --> 1:16:44.600
(Victoria sighs)

1:16:48.270 --> 1:16:51.673
- It just means
there's no progress.

1:17:03.418 --> 1:17:04.853
- [Psychologist] And
so with this one girl,

1:17:04.853 --> 1:17:07.756
I think it just
got too, too deep,

1:17:07.756 --> 1:17:10.025
and too personal,
and too serious.

1:17:10.025 --> 1:17:11.994
- Do you feel like
she'll work it out?

1:17:16.698 --> 1:17:19.267
- [Psychologist] I don't know.

1:17:21.203 --> 1:17:23.538
- I'm angry about it and I,

1:17:25.407 --> 1:17:28.510
something needs to
be done about it.

1:17:28.510 --> 1:17:32.681
I just, it's too late for
this specific situation, but,

1:17:35.651 --> 1:17:37.185
maybe not in the future.

1:17:37.185 --> 1:17:39.755
- Answer your fucking
phone (sniffling).

1:17:50.866 --> 1:17:53.869
(knocking at door)

1:17:55.604 --> 1:17:56.505
One second.

1:18:09.584 --> 1:18:11.086
- [Psychologist] Do you
think that that's a factor

1:18:11.086 --> 1:18:13.221
in why you're not interested
in having a relationship?

1:18:15.557 --> 1:18:16.425
- I just,

1:18:20.929 --> 1:18:21.830
I don't know.

1:18:24.066 --> 1:18:26.968
It's like, they're all the same.

1:18:26.968 --> 1:18:30.038
- I'm just like, playing over
and over again in my head.

1:18:31.673 --> 1:18:33.909
What you said and what I said.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:39.648
I didn't mean it,

1:18:41.717 --> 1:18:43.218
I didn't mean it,

1:18:43.218 --> 1:18:46.855
so I don't think that you
meant what you said either.

1:18:46.855 --> 1:18:49.825
I don't think, you
think that I'm crazy.

1:18:49.825 --> 1:18:54.696
I don't think, that you
think that I'm hopeless.

1:18:54.696 --> 1:18:57.733
I think you were just
saying things to be mean,

1:18:57.733 --> 1:18:59.434
and you thought that it
would make me go away,

1:18:59.434 --> 1:19:01.002
but you're wrong.

1:19:01.002 --> 1:19:04.673
I'm not going away and
I'm not going anywhere.

1:19:04.673 --> 1:19:05.941
- [Psychologist]
Do you think that

1:19:05.941 --> 1:19:07.142
you're afraid to maybe
get close to somebody,

1:19:07.142 --> 1:19:10.145
'cause you're afraid
of what kind of,

1:19:10.979 --> 1:19:12.647
hurt that they can do to you?

1:19:14.249 --> 1:19:16.852
- I don't, could
be, I'm not sure.

1:19:21.089 --> 1:19:22.824
- [Psychologist] I mean,
it is a heavy thing.

1:19:22.824 --> 1:19:23.959
That's serious stuff.

1:19:25.894 --> 1:19:26.795
- Okay.

1:19:30.198 --> 1:19:31.099
Okay.

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:36.972
- If I was too angry,
well, I'm really sorry,

1:19:37.773 --> 1:19:39.007
I didn't mean to be so angry.

1:19:39.007 --> 1:19:42.544
I just, you're not
being very fair,

1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:47.015
but ultimately I just
would really like it

1:19:47.015 --> 1:19:48.617
if you'd call me back.

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:50.185
You should pick up your phone,

1:19:50.185 --> 1:19:52.654
and listen to all of
my goddamn voicemails,

1:19:52.654 --> 1:19:54.790
and try calling me back.

1:20:01.463 --> 1:20:04.299
(Victoria sighs)

1:20:14.376 --> 1:20:17.279
(paper rustling)

1:20:22.717 --> 1:20:24.586
- [Psychologist]
Do you feel like,

1:20:24.586 --> 1:20:28.523
you have a different view
of men since that happened?

1:20:29.491 --> 1:20:31.159
- Somewhat, but even before him,

1:20:31.159 --> 1:20:34.396
there were always signs that,

1:20:38.099 --> 1:20:40.869
I've been around enough men
to know what they're like.

1:20:45.373 --> 1:20:46.575
I know.

1:20:46.575 --> 1:20:47.509
- [Psychologist]
But, you know all men

1:20:47.509 --> 1:20:48.410
are not like that, right?

1:20:48.410 --> 1:20:53.148
- Not all, no, but many.

1:20:54.783 --> 1:20:56.284
- [Psychologist] Many
that you encounter.

1:20:56.284 --> 1:20:58.453
- That I've encountered, sure.

1:20:58.453 --> 1:20:59.721
- [Psychologist]
But, I'm sure there's

1:20:59.721 --> 1:21:01.256
a lot of good people
out there, right?

1:21:01.256 --> 1:21:06.328
- Sure, I'm sure there are-
- Who would never do that.

1:21:06.328 --> 1:21:09.097
(Victoria sighs)

1:21:10.832 --> 1:21:13.235
There's plenty of guys
that would never do that.

1:21:13.235 --> 1:21:14.102
- Okay.

1:21:16.438 --> 1:21:17.339
- [Psychologist] Do
you believe that?

1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:21.309
- I'm sure there are guys
that wouldn't do that.

1:21:41.596 --> 1:21:44.399
(Victoria sighs)

1:21:48.470 --> 1:21:50.739
It's hard to tell which ones,

1:21:50.739 --> 1:21:54.843
they're so good at pretending
to be one thing, and then,

1:21:56.578 --> 1:21:58.947
being something
completely different.

1:22:00.415 --> 1:22:01.516
- I hate my father.

1:22:15.964 --> 1:22:16.865
I hate myself.

1:22:18.133 --> 1:22:21.069
- It's something that
reflects in all of us.

1:22:21.069 --> 1:22:24.039
We all have the capability
of being really fucked up.

1:22:24.039 --> 1:22:25.340
- Then, I'm like (blows air).

1:22:29.811 --> 1:22:32.147
(sighs) I don't know.

1:22:36.751 --> 1:22:38.219
- [Psychologist] I
think you got a lot

1:22:38.219 --> 1:22:39.187
you still gotta figure out.

1:22:41.256 --> 1:22:44.426
But, really, I can't help you,
you have to help yourself.

1:22:46.895 --> 1:22:48.229
- But, that's so scary.

1:22:50.231 --> 1:22:51.967
- [Psychologist] How
is this helping you?

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:55.136
It's been months of this,
how is this helping you?

1:22:56.671 --> 1:22:58.540
- How are you helping me?

1:22:58.540 --> 1:22:59.841
- [Psychologist] How is
any of this helping you?

1:22:59.841 --> 1:23:02.043
- No one lives
happily ever after.

1:23:05.146 --> 1:23:07.782
- But, there is a line, like
we were talking about before,

1:23:07.782 --> 1:23:09.284
there is a line you gotta draw,

1:23:09.284 --> 1:23:10.785
because she's actually
not in your personal life.

1:23:10.785 --> 1:23:11.820
She's your client.

1:23:13.054 --> 1:23:15.323
Therefore, that's
where it's like,

1:23:15.323 --> 1:23:16.825
conflict of interest.

1:23:16.825 --> 1:23:18.560
- [Psychologist] Well, I guess
that's where I messed up.

1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:19.995
(sirens wailing)

1:23:19.995 --> 1:23:22.797
(intense music)

1:23:25.834 --> 1:23:28.336
(door slams)

1:23:35.143 --> 1:23:36.044
- Hello?

1:23:42.050 --> 1:23:45.653
Just makes so much sense
for us to be together.

1:23:45.653 --> 1:23:48.456
We laugh at the same things.

1:23:48.456 --> 1:23:50.558
We like the same things.

1:23:50.558 --> 1:23:52.460
We dress similar.

1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:54.896
We love the same music.

1:23:54.896 --> 1:23:57.999
We grew up in similar families.

1:23:57.999 --> 1:24:00.201
We both hate stupid people.

1:24:00.201 --> 1:24:01.936
I don't get it,

1:24:01.936 --> 1:24:06.541
I'm literally alive to
be his partner in life,

1:24:06.541 --> 1:24:08.276
It's obvious to me.

1:24:11.646 --> 1:24:12.814
I will show him.

1:24:15.183 --> 1:24:17.052
I will show him.

1:24:19.587 --> 1:24:20.622
I will show him.

1:24:21.890 --> 1:24:23.324
I will show him.

1:24:25.827 --> 1:24:27.429
I will show him.

1:24:27.429 --> 1:24:28.496
Hey, you,

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:35.804
I'm calling to see if
you're around later.

1:24:37.172 --> 1:24:38.973
I will be in the area,

1:24:38.973 --> 1:24:42.877
and I just thought it would
be really convenient for us,

1:24:42.877 --> 1:24:44.579
if we can meet really quick,

1:24:44.579 --> 1:24:46.748
and just talk about
a couple of things,

1:24:46.748 --> 1:24:49.451
and just wrap all of this up.

1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:54.989
I know we still love each other
and care about each other.

1:24:56.491 --> 1:25:01.563
Let's just put an
end to all of this,

1:25:02.363 --> 1:25:03.364
you can give me my things.

1:25:04.732 --> 1:25:08.603
We can finally get closure,
say goodbye, and move on.

1:25:09.537 --> 1:25:11.005
We can both move on.

1:25:11.005 --> 1:25:12.774
I know you're having just
as much trouble as me,

1:25:17.378 --> 1:25:18.880
I will talk to you soon.

1:25:19.848 --> 1:25:20.748
Okay, bye.

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:32.861
Hey,

1:25:43.204 --> 1:25:45.807
I just really miss you.

1:25:45.807 --> 1:25:47.041
(pen scratching)

1:25:47.041 --> 1:25:49.611
(hand smacks)

1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:54.883
(Victoria sighs)

1:26:06.461 --> 1:26:09.597
(Victoria blows air)

1:26:11.399 --> 1:26:15.036
(blaring intense guitar music)

1:27:04.152 --> 1:27:06.554
Hey, it's me.

1:27:06.554 --> 1:27:08.923
I'm outside your house,

1:27:08.923 --> 1:27:13.995
and if you're home, you
should just come outside.

1:27:15.797 --> 1:27:17.699
I can do things, you know?

1:27:17.699 --> 1:27:19.234
I just wanna like,

1:27:21.169 --> 1:27:25.106
I just wanna feel you, and
see you, and touch you.

1:27:25.106 --> 1:27:28.943
I'm just outside, just
walk like a couple feet,

1:27:28.943 --> 1:27:30.845
and I'm right here.

1:27:32.313 --> 1:27:33.514
I miss you.

1:27:33.514 --> 1:27:35.416
I know you're still
in love with me.

1:27:35.416 --> 1:27:37.085
We're gonna be together forever.

1:27:37.085 --> 1:27:39.053
If you look out your window
right now, I'm like right here,

1:27:39.053 --> 1:27:40.755
I'm waving at you.

1:27:40.755 --> 1:27:43.858
I just had a horrible
thought, I hope you're alone.

1:27:43.858 --> 1:27:45.660
I look really nice.

1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:49.664
I put on a sexy dress,
I put on my lipstick.

1:27:51.232 --> 1:27:53.201
I'm not wearing a bra.

1:27:55.236 --> 1:27:57.639
(chuckles) Come out and see me.

1:27:57.639 --> 1:28:00.975
I'm your special someone,

1:28:02.343 --> 1:28:05.947
and you're mine,
you're mine forever.

1:28:07.749 --> 1:28:09.951
(chuckles) You'll see.

1:28:09.951 --> 1:28:15.023
I'm in a really fun
mood, majorly fun.

1:28:16.924 --> 1:28:18.559
You know, I'm open (chuckles).

1:28:22.897 --> 1:28:27.969
Oh, babe, baby, baby,
baby, I miss you.

1:28:29.237 --> 1:28:30.738
I miss you so much.

1:28:30.738 --> 1:28:33.441
I miss the sound of your voice.

1:28:34.742 --> 1:28:37.912
All I get are your
voicemail sounds.

1:28:39.414 --> 1:28:41.382
That's a robot, that's not you.

1:28:44.952 --> 1:28:50.024
I just wanna be with you,

1:28:50.692 --> 1:28:52.060
like intertwined.

1:28:54.896 --> 1:28:57.999
In each other, together.

1:29:01.436 --> 1:29:03.938
I just want, I don't
wanna be alone anymore.

1:29:05.039 --> 1:29:06.641
Being alone is the worst.

1:29:08.109 --> 1:29:13.181
I'm constantly lost, and
fading into my oblivion.

1:29:20.388 --> 1:29:22.357
Heh, oops.

1:29:34.469 --> 1:29:38.539
Hey, why are you hiding?

1:29:39.907 --> 1:29:41.976
You want me to find you?

1:29:41.976 --> 1:29:45.613
I did, I'm outside, I found you.

1:29:45.613 --> 1:29:50.351
Your turn, come find me,
come find me, please.

1:29:53.087 --> 1:29:55.556
I don't really wanna
do this anymore.

1:30:53.080 --> 1:30:56.818
(ominous orchestral music)
