00:02.160 --> 00:03.685
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.920 --> 00:05.206
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:08.649
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.080 --> 00:10.650
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.490
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:12.800 --> 00:14.848
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:15.520 --> 00:18.126
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:19.601
Previously on Arrow...

00:19.840 --> 00:20.887
Who's Lonnie Machin?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.770
<i>"MALCOLM". He's kind of
an ex-boyfriend of Thea's.</i>

00:23.040 --> 00:25.281
Tell me where I can find Damien Darhk?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.604
<i>You don't need another man
clouding your mind.</i>

00:29.960 --> 00:30.961
Alex, run!

00:35.280 --> 00:36.281
It's gone.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.806
Lyla, you need to tell us what Rubicon is.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.442
It's every NATO ally. Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.801
<i>We have 12 hours to stop it.</i>

00:45.960 --> 00:49.521
Darhk is powered by death.
So, if even one of those nukes hits...

00:49.760 --> 00:50.966
<i>He'll be unstoppable.</i>

00:51.320 --> 00:52.481
We lost one. It's in the air.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.601
Direct hit on Havenrock.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.921
How many casualties?

00:58.160 --> 00:59.321
<i>"LYLA". Tens of thousands.</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:05.519
Hello, Oliver. Nice timing.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.800
I think you're
going to need much bigger arrows.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.962
Cool. You know,
I didn't even mean to do that.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.410
I turn steel arrows into dust,
and you thought lead would do the trick?

01:22.600 --> 01:24.011
He's not human anymore.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.041
Oh, I'm still human. Just better.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.328
Doesn't give you
the right to remake the world.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.842
Why not? It's been done before.
Noah and the flood.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.651
People even worship the responsible party.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.646
This might smart a little.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.043
I'm pulling the oxygen out of your bodies,
molecule by molecule,

01:50.200 --> 01:51.201
but here's the good news.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.807
I'm not going to kill you.
Well, not right now, at least.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.440
Instead, I'm going to
regain control of Rubicon.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.365
That way, when the whole world
goes all Dr. Strangelove,

01:59.520 --> 02:02.171
you can feel your skin
melt from Armageddon.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.006
Oliver, let's go!

02:17.960 --> 02:19.644
Come on! We gotta go, now!

02:47.040 --> 02:48.087
Come On.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.611
What happened here?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.602
Too bad. I liked him for you.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.606
Where's Machin?

03:02.600 --> 03:04.011
I... I don't know.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.567
He disappeared, okay?
I wasn't paying attention.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.609
Why do I have trouble believing you?

03:14.120 --> 03:15.610
Let go of me!

03:15.760 --> 03:19.446
Not to sound too much like your father,
but I really think you need a timeout.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.250
<i>Government officials
couldn't confirm the death toll.</i>

03:25.400 --> 03:29.450
<i>However, various reports
place the number in the tens of thousands.</i>

03:29.640 --> 03:33.087
<i>Evacuation efforts
of the surrounding areas continue...</i>

03:34.440 --> 03:35.487
What are you doing?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.483
We can't afford
to get caught up in grief right now.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.880
Now, I've bought us 24 hours

03:39.040 --> 03:41.884
by sending Rubicon's launch algorithms
into an infinite loop,

03:42.040 --> 03:43.963
but if we can't find a more permanent...

03:45.960 --> 03:47.564
God, what am I doing?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.485
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- Don't "sweetheart" me.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.608
You don't get to do that,
but you're right.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.649
I can't get wrapped up in this.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.969
Have you been watching the news?

04:01.120 --> 04:02.167
I can't stop.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.369
Ironically, last week my mom was giving me
a hard time about living in Star City.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.760
Between the earthquakes,

04:06.920 --> 04:09.400
the viral attacks,
the homicidal super soldiers,

04:09.600 --> 04:10.840
why would anyone want to live here?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.606
It turns out we live in
only the second worst place in America.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.761
Curtis.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.680
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.168
This is my father. Noah Kuttler.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.371
Noah Kuttler. Huh.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.968
You know, it's funny
because there's this super hacker

04:27.160 --> 04:30.050
who's wanted by the FBI
whose name is also Noah Kuttler.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.328
He's kind of a big deal on the Dark Web.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.207
Honestly, I thought they could have used
a more flattering photo

04:35.360 --> 04:36.691
for the wanted poster.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.525
Wait, you...

04:39.680 --> 04:42.126
You're the Noah Kuttler?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.528
And, if you're Felicity's dad,
you were married to Donna...

04:45.720 --> 04:48.041
And you make so much more sense now.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.881
Yup.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.041
This is... it was a big mystery.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.241
I was trying to figure out, like, how...

04:52.400 --> 04:53.401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.924
We have work to do.
HIVE was behind the Havenrock explosion.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.123
They stole a cyberweapon called Rubicon

05:00.320 --> 05:02.482
and now are using it
to commandeer the world's nukes.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.922
So, we have less than 24 hours to stop it,

05:05.080 --> 05:08.050
or the world is going to
experience the sequel to WarGames.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.891
Actually, there was
a direct-to-DVD sequel in 2008,

05:11.080 --> 05:13.321
but it was a bomb, too,
so, that reference still holds.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.447
I have to go.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.481
Don't worry.
Me and your fugitive dad have got this.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.401
He says, just realizing
he said that out loud.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.449
Today was supposed to be Christmas,
and I woke up to a lump of coal.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.841
Is it because I've been naughty this year?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.651
It's because Kuttler and his daughter
are wrestling us for Rubicon.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.848
Which is why
I felt the need to up our game.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.924
Mr. Seldon, pleasure to see you.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.407
Do you know what the best part
about leading a prison break is?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.927
A long list of criminals that owe you.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.691
Amar, Brickwell, and now Mr. Seldon.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.525
- It's like one-stop shopping for thugs.
- I'm a hacker, not a thug.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.331
Oh. Turns out he and Ms. Smoak
have a history.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.960
Just your typical boy meets girl,
boy falls in love with girl,

06:06.120 --> 06:07.849
boy goes to jail for girl.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.809
Boy tries to kill girl for money.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.082
Speaking of thugs,
we have a new problem at Tevat Noah.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.170
Not this guy again.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.450
Don't worry, darling.
I'm dealing with him.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.961
Give Mr. Machin my love, my love.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.203
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.163
<i>A long-range ballistic KN-08 missile</i>

06:41.320 --> 06:44.529
<i>was responsible
for the nuclear blast at Havenrock.</i>

06:44.680 --> 06:47.570
<i>The Pentagon has not further commented.</i>

06:50.840 --> 06:53.320
What's going on?
What the hell happened in Havenrock?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.527
Darhk happened.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.529
This city is starting to panic.
Are they right to?

06:56.680 --> 06:57.920
Felicity's got it under control,

06:58.080 --> 06:59.491
but my wife
and her top secret government agency's

06:59.640 --> 07:00.846
looking for a more permanent solution.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.126
I cannot get in touch with Thea!

07:02.280 --> 07:04.282
- It's okay. She got a hold of me.
- All right.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.931
Thanks for not being dead.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.845
Um, aren't we all going to be
if you're away from your computer?

07:11.360 --> 07:12.930
Curtis and Kuttler
are dealing with Rubicon.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.485
What did Thea say?
Do you know where she is?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.608
It's not good news. HIVE has her.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.410
- Do you have a location?
- I'm tracing a signal.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.006
I should have taken more processors
from Palmer Tech on my way out.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.685
They made a mistake letting you go.
They'll see it.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.320
And if they don't,
I'm taking revenge plan suggestions.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.486
Got it. Thea's message came from
the intersection of Berkeley and Childers

07:28.680 --> 07:29.681
right in the heart of the Glades.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.121
I thought you said
Thea and her boyfriend went out of town.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.327
I thought they did.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.527
Let's go.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.404
- I'm coming with you.
- I want you to stay here.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.001
If this gets worse, the city's going to
need someone to listen to

07:39.160 --> 07:40.525
that they can trust.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.246
What is it? Say something.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.686
Your eyes were glowing.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.410
Like Reiter?

07:54.560 --> 07:55.971
On, my God.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.889
- Oliver, what's happening to me?
- It doesn't matter.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.447
We will figure it out,
but for now we have to keep moving.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.886
All right? Come on.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.286
Oliver!

08:28.680 --> 08:31.081
It's incredible.

08:31.280 --> 08:35.001
I know now why Reiter sought this power.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.684
When you furrow your brow like that,
you look just like Moira.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.047
Don't you dare talk about my mother.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.204
Fine. Let's talk about the future instead.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.771
Genesis is coming.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.564
With Machin running around,

08:51.760 --> 08:54.604
we can't have
another X-factor on the loose.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.531
"We"? Not your HIVE overlords?

08:58.520 --> 09:02.445
Point being, I need your word
that you won't cause any trouble.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.961
Or what?

09:04.680 --> 09:07.570
Or I will have to do something
to assure your compliance

09:07.720 --> 09:09.882
that I really don't want to do.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.645
Well, when there's something
I don't want to do,

09:13.800 --> 09:15.290
I just get it over with.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.408
This will make everything better.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.241
Overwatch,
are you sure this is the spot?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.129
There's nothing here.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.486
That's impossible.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.284
Okay, not impossible,

09:42.440 --> 09:46.684
but my backtrace on Thea's message
has a 99.9999% accuracy rate,

09:46.840 --> 09:49.161
so unless this is part
of the .0001 percentile...

09:49.320 --> 09:51.163
<i>It's just an empty street.</i>

09:51.360 --> 09:52.691
Just look
for anything out of place, all right?

09:52.840 --> 09:55.889
Whatever HIVE has built
is probably recent, you know, new.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.771
Is there supposed to be
sewer access on the street?

10:00.920 --> 10:02.490
<i>Not according to city plans.</i>

10:03.400 --> 10:04.401
Stand by.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.730
Help me with something, Malcolm.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.929
How is it again that this
juvenile annoyance, Lonnie Machin,

10:23.080 --> 10:24.366
is still a problem for us?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.722
- Machin is exactly what we...
- Actually, I've changed my mind.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.850
I'm not interested in excuses,
just results.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.121
Yes?

10:33.320 --> 10:35.209
<i>Two hostiles have
breached the southeast entrance,</i>

10:35.400 --> 10:36.890
<i>one in green, the other in black.</i>

10:37.040 --> 10:39.520
Send a squad
and secure the entrance.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.761
Green and black.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.570
Oliver's come
for his baby sister, most likely.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.927
Mmm. And since she's only here
because of you,

10:45.120 --> 10:48.169
lbeHeve
that makes Mr. Queen your problem.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.563
You have a lot on your plate, Malcolm.
I suggest you get started.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.721
Come on, sweetie.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.088
How did HIVE build all this
without anyone knowing?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.287
Well,
doesn't hurt having someone

11:02.440 --> 11:04.169
controlling the city's infrastructure.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.163
Can't find any public blueprints on file

11:06.320 --> 11:08.243
for an underground lair
with a creepy sewer entrance.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.766
Believe me,
there are no public blueprints for this.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.082
Unbelievable.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.850
Just like Mount Weather.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.923
Continuity of government facility
built by FEMA during the Cold War,

11:25.120 --> 11:26.451
in case of a nuclear attack.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.331
I think that we found the ark
that HIVE's been building.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.890
- What?
- I lost their signal.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.166
Well, get it back.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.324
I have to get back to Curtis and Kuttler.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.166
All right. I'll cover comms.
I hear anything, I'll patch you in.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.129
What's the emergency?
Is Rubicon still stabilized?

11:55.280 --> 11:58.648
Where is Kuttler? Did he do something?
Did he... Are you drinking a beer?

11:58.800 --> 12:01.167
I knew that
being a child of divorce was hard,

12:01.640 --> 12:05.486
but what I did not have any idea about
was all the yelling,

12:05.640 --> 12:08.120
the name-calling, the loudness.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.484
- You poor thing.
- Uh... Oh.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.681
What are you talking about?

12:11.840 --> 12:12.841
Oh, God, do you even listen?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.485
So, I'm here to take her away from you?

12:14.640 --> 12:16.244
My God, you just...
Yada, yada. My brain...

12:16.400 --> 12:18.846
- Honestly, my brain is numb.
- Can we not with her here? She's here.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.651
This really is the end of the world.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.001
It actually does the opposite.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.403
Baby, I've been so worried about you.
Oh, my God.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.963
Do you know I have called?

12:29.120 --> 12:30.884
I have called you a million times, baby.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.166
I have been calling and calling.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.845
- Are you okay?
- Mom, I'm fine.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.126
Just been a little distracted.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.441
With your father?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.166
Thanks for telling me.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.490
I don't know.
Everything just happened so fast.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.641
What has?

12:44.560 --> 12:45.561
Sit down.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.089
What? What?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.446
I have to tell you something.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.806
I'm going to be a grandma!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.207
- I'm going to be a grandma!
- No, no, no. No, you're not.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.522
I knew you had
more than a bad burrito the other day.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.681
I knew it was more than that.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.281
- Okay.No“.
- Baby! Baby!

13:05.440 --> 13:07.442
I am not pregnant.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.210
Is that the only news
that a woman can have?

13:09.360 --> 13:11.044
The world is under attack,
and I need my...

13:11.200 --> 13:13.680
I need Noah to help me stop it.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.489
Honey, what happened
in Havenrock is horrible,

13:16.640 --> 13:18.324
but that doesn't mean
the world is going to end.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.885
- She's telling the truth.
- You know, I know...

13:20.040 --> 13:22.407
Which she clearly gets
from my side of the family, thank you.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.885
You know, I know
when my daughter is lying, okay?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.371
There were plenty of times
when she was a teenager,

13:26.520 --> 13:27.726
not that you would know.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.126
Here we go.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.964
For once, this isn't about you, Dee.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.730
Oh, you're calling me "Dee"?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.882
- There are nuclear missiles...
- Are you calling me "Dee"?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.366
Somebody stick something sharp in my eye.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.010
It is going to happen to the entire world.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.525
Unless we stop it, which we will.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.843
Sweetie, why do you even think
this is something that you can...

13:43.000 --> 13:45.367
Because I work with the Green Arrow, Mom.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.805
- For how long?
- Three years.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.444
And you've been keeping this from me?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.081
Yes.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.721
Wow, I guess you and your father
are more alike than I thought.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.609
- Mom.
- We can talk about it later, hon,

14:00.760 --> 14:03.650
after you save the world.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.441
Get in here.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.647
FELICITYI Oh!

14:07.800 --> 14:08.801
Yeah.

14:10.760 --> 14:15.607
The world's two best hackers side by side.
This is history.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.730
I mean, it's... It's no biggie.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.921
What just happened?

14:22.280 --> 14:23.566
Oh, my God.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.007
It's crazy.
Take away the psychos in the smocks...

14:35.160 --> 14:38.164
might as well be Ivy Town.
Everyone looks so happy.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.971
Happy's when you're mindless
on some little yellow pill.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.408
Let's just assume
we weren't invited over for casserole.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.766
What's our play?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.968
We split up and find Thea.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.282
Scope the houses on the north.
I'll head south.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.650
<i>Good afternoon.
Today is a brisk and sunny 75 degrees.</i>

14:55.800 --> 14:58.087
<i>It is a lovely day to be outside.</i>

14:58.280 --> 15:03.286
<i>As we all enjoy Tevat Noah, I want to
take this moment to express my gratitude.</i>

15:03.640 --> 15:06.120
<i>And I want to thank each and every one...</i>

15:18.320 --> 15:19.731
I've got eyes on Thea.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.962
Fourth house down.
There are two hostiles with her.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.850
Speedy, let's get you out of here.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.885
Are you all right?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.206
I have the intruder.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.680
Move, and I will kill you.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.124
- Thea...
- Don't move.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.727
Listen to me.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.763
You're not thinking clearly.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.810
In her defense,
she's a little drugged at the moment.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.929
I should have taken your head.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.328
That's always been your problem.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.847
An inability to do what is necessary.

16:15.360 --> 16:19.160
Laurel is dead because of you.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.811
What are you going to do?

16:22.120 --> 16:25.647
We've already established
you're not going to kill me.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.443
- What the hell?
- It's the yellow pills.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.965
Son of a bitch.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.404
We got to go. Let's move!

17:55.760 --> 17:57.444
Not that it's not scintillating
to watch you type,

17:57.600 --> 17:59.967
but when exactly will I have Rubicon back?

18:00.120 --> 18:02.726
Hacking isn't as easy as waving your hand.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.120
Ah. Point taken.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.925
So, you and Felicity Smoak.
I just don't see it.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.001
She used to be a lot different.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.488
All clear. Looks like
we bought ourselves a few minutes.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.325
John, this place is enormous.
I don't know how we're going to find Thea.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.484
Just have to make sure
that the Ghosts don't find us.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.685
So much for clear.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.641
We're not going to hurt you.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.490
Then what are the weapons for?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.371
There's a woman
being held against her will.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.965
We're just here to bring her home.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.363
<i>Citizens of Tevat Noah,
I have disturbing news.</i>

18:48.560 --> 18:50.722
<i>We are under attack
from a man in a green hood</i>

18:50.880 --> 18:52.245
<i>and another in a black helmet.</i>

18:53.000 --> 18:55.162
<i>Do not let them disrupt Genesis.</i>

18:56.200 --> 18:59.204
<i>These individuals
are not only an affront to our home,</i>

18:59.360 --> 19:02.648
<i>but to our future
and the futures of our children.</i>

19:02.800 --> 19:04.564
<i>Find them and kill them.</i>

19:08.880 --> 19:09.881
Oh, no.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.048
It's okay, Oliver.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.328
I know what to do now.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.802
I finally understand
what Reiter was after.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.211
Taiana, Reiter was insane.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.441
TAIANAI Why?

19:22.640 --> 19:26.770
He said after his village was destroyed,
he would never be powerless again.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.129
I have a village, too, Krasnoyarsk,

19:30.280 --> 19:32.601
run by a government strongman named Kovar.

19:32.840 --> 19:33.887
Taiana...

19:34.040 --> 19:36.407
Now I know
why fate has led me to this place.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.006
To give me the strength to free my home.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.128
Okay. All right.

19:41.320 --> 19:45.564
You'll go back to Russia,
and you can take on this Kovar.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.122
But right now there are people here
that need our help.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.049
What would Vlad want you to do?

19:54.480 --> 19:57.689
What would your brother expect you to do?

19:59.320 --> 20:01.561
Find these hostiles at once.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.128
Nothing can be permitted
to stand in the way of Genesis.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.281
Thank you.

20:07.680 --> 20:12.288
I'm not sure murdering vigilantes is
what your loyal supporters signed up for.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.764
Well, you better hope that
they don't find Mr. Queen and Mr. Diggle

20:16.960 --> 20:17.961
before you do, Malcolm,

20:18.120 --> 20:22.330
or I'll be forced to seriously question
what your purpose here is.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.046
Every time I knock down a firewall,
five more pop back up.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.646
It would seem that Mr. Darhk
has a counter-hacker in his employ.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.484
- And he's good.
- Yeah.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.404
Okay. I might have something.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.848
Now, until the FBI gets their way,
smartphones are protected by encryption.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.321
If you don't enter your passcode
after enough times,

20:45.480 --> 20:47.209
then the device bricks itself, right?

20:47.360 --> 20:49.931
Curtis, I don't even have the time
to tell you that I don't have the time.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.445
You just did. But here's the point.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.290
Instead of trying
to break Rubicon's encryption...

20:53.480 --> 20:54.527
We make it stop working
in the first place.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.967
You're suggesting
as it is with a smartphone...

20:57.120 --> 20:59.043
We overload Rubicon
with too many access requests.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.321
And it shuts itself down.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.289
Unfortunately, I doubt very much
that A.R.G.U.S.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.490
would leave Rubicon so vulnerable
to such a brute force attack.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.846
Let them try.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.680
You're always such a stick in the mud.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.846
Yes!

21:12.040 --> 21:13.485
Let's all take hacking advice

21:13.640 --> 21:17.361
from a woman whose only use
for her smartphone is as a mirror.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.646
So funny. Not.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.370
Felicity may have
gotten her brains from you,

21:24.520 --> 21:27.490
but she got her creativity from moi.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.410
Matching lipstick
to lip liner isn't creativity.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.364
And, while I may
not be father of the year...

21:33.560 --> 21:34.891
Oh, try the past two decades.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.169
I recently took a bullet for our daughter.
Not metaphorically, either.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.005
- By the way, a metaphor, it's a...
- Oh, I know what a metaphor means,

21:41.160 --> 21:43.049
just like I know
what abandoning your family looks like.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.249
Really? Because I remember
not having much of a choice in the matter.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.211
<i>- Uh... Felicity?
- Hello, Felicity.</i>

21:52.360 --> 21:53.600
- Remember me?
- Cooper.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.240
<i>Your system is now under my control,</i>

21:56.400 --> 21:58.926
<i>just like Rubicon will be
in the next five minutes.</i>

21:59.080 --> 22:00.764
<i>Once again, you lose.</i>

22:01.080 --> 22:02.730
<i>- O'n, flak.
- Oh, flak.</i>

22:07.920 --> 22:09.763
Who is this guy, again?

22:09.920 --> 22:13.163
Cooper Seldon, her ex-boyfriend.
How could I forget?

22:13.320 --> 22:15.129
I thought he was dead,
and he just came back evil.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.964
Oliver, Dr. Palmer, this guy.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.043
You really have
a complicated romantic history.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.326
Not the best time, Curtis.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.481
Be honest, Felicity, hacker to hacker.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.961
You prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.281
Once more unto the breach.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.930
Is he seriously going
full Star Trek VI on you?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.360
He shut our system down with a virus.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.966
- It's an X-axis binumeric algorithm.
- I know.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.930
I created it in college. Wait.
How did you know?

22:41.080 --> 22:42.320
Just because I wasn't in your life

22:42.480 --> 22:44.801
doesn't mean
I wasn't keeping tabs on my daughter.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.769
He's sending electrical surges
to all our previous lPs!

22:58.640 --> 22:59.846
Whatever it is, it's working.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.331
It is, but it's pinging back
to his location.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.521
You thinking what I'm thinking?

23:02.680 --> 23:04.330
We hitch our own code onto the back trace.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.641
Curtis, your Rubicon lockout...

23:05.800 --> 23:07.370
How long
till you can get me an executable?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.807
- Uh... Twenty seconds.
- Great.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.211
If this works, it will send the latest
surge back to its point of origin,

23:14.360 --> 23:15.646
triggering Rubicon to lock itself out.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.644
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Just get the son of a bitch.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.364
Locked and loaded.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.561
Got you.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.570
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.566
To be or not to be...

23:44.200 --> 23:45.247
Did it work?

23:45.440 --> 23:46.521
- I think it worked.
- It worked.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.842
Well, the power's still on.
That's... That's good, right?

23:49.520 --> 23:50.726
Rubicon's offline.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.683
He's going to need more
than some third-rate hacker

23:54.840 --> 23:57.844
to get it back up again,
all because of you, sweetheart.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.121
Thanks, Dad.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.521
Mom?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.171
Streets are filled.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.005
Ruvé's mobilized the entire ark
looking for us.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.565
They're in here!

24:28.880 --> 24:29.927
Quiet.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.321
You can't win. You can't stop Genesis.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.370
What are you going to do when you're
not here to enjoy your brave new world?

24:35.520 --> 24:36.521
Spartan.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.486
Easy.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.765
He almost got us killed.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.088
They're like Thea.
They're not in their right minds.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.480
<i>"MAN". You mean the pills?</i>

24:46.640 --> 24:49.689
We haven't taken any. Not even one.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.241
<i>None of us have.</i>

24:51.760 --> 24:54.969
We're here because we believe.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.411
Because we know
the world is evil and darkness.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.011
It's beyond saving.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.601
How can you believe that?

25:02.760 --> 25:06.606
Because we've lived it. Every day.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.525
So many promises
were made to save the city.

25:13.080 --> 25:18.211
But it all just fell apart,
and we were the ones left in the rubble.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.924
Damien Darhk has given us hope.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.047
Can you, with your masks and your guns,
actually say the same?

25:55.000 --> 25:58.686
There's a plane due east.
Stay here. We'll hold off Reiter's men.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.808
Taiana, help me with this guy. He's alive.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.486
Hey. He's alive. Help me with him.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.051
He's too bad.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.248
He'll only slow us.
Keep us from helping the others.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.084
We're not just going to leave him here.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.480
You're right.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.322
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?
- His death is inevitable.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.801
Why waste his life
when it can make me stronger?

26:34.200 --> 26:35.804
What are you doing with my clothes?

26:36.360 --> 26:40.001
When I get stressed, I... I like to fold.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.361
Yeah.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.364
I know. When you two were married,
it was like living at the Gap.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.121
Hey, what did Noah mean when he said

26:47.280 --> 26:49.123
that he didn't have much choice
in the matter when he left?

26:51.600 --> 26:54.206
I always just assumed he disappeared.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.847
He didn't disappear, hon.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.881
I did.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.361
We did.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.042
I had a 7-year-old daughter,
and I know all about gambling,

27:09.200 --> 27:15.731
and I wasn't willing to take the bet
that your father could possibly change.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.327
You let me believe that he abandoned us.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.521
Well, I don't...

27:21.920 --> 27:24.685
I don't know
what to say about that, hon.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.444
I mean, I think...

27:29.120 --> 27:32.044
I think he just didn't
want you to lose your mom, too.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.484
Hey, look at me.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.445
I didn't lose you.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.366
Did I?

27:41.240 --> 27:42.287
Never.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.924
I'm sorry.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.326
I love you.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.288
Do you ever think
that maybe Darhk has a point?

28:09.320 --> 28:12.722
No, Darhk is psychotic.
Everyone down here is.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.206
Are they?

28:15.080 --> 28:16.286
He's not wrong.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.447
The world is coming apart
just like Star City.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.171
I mean, it is worse than it has ever been.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.641
That's because Darhk's been
spending the past year trying to kill it.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.486
Then why is he giving these people
more hope than we ever could?

28:31.880 --> 28:34.804
Go! Go to the bedroom! Take cover!
Go! Move, move, move!

28:35.760 --> 28:38.206
I'll hold them off. Go find Thea. Go, now!

28:47.000 --> 28:48.161
Thea.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.770
This isn't you, Thea.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.604
They are trying to control you.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.001
But you are stronger than that.
You can fight through it.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.404
L...

29:23.080 --> 29:24.081
can't.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.606
Yes, you can!

29:25.960 --> 29:29.362
Every day, we stand side by side
to protect this city,

29:29.520 --> 29:31.966
and no matter how dark or how hopeless,

29:32.160 --> 29:34.766
you always keep fighting,
you never give up!

29:36.040 --> 29:38.691
I refuse to believe
that you're going to give up now.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.925
So, fighfl

30:08.600 --> 30:12.002
Drug me again,
and I will kill you, you son of a bitch.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.571
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

30:19.640 --> 30:20.880
<i>Uncle Lonnie here.</i>

30:21.040 --> 30:24.931
<i>See, I just absolutely adore
your little community.</i>

30:25.080 --> 30:27.242
<i>It's so welcoming to outsiders.</i>

30:27.400 --> 30:30.449
<i>But it's so structured.</i>

30:30.640 --> 30:32.722
<i>Going to have to fix that.</i>

30:35.600 --> 30:38.171
<i>Mr. Darhk, remember me?</i>

30:38.320 --> 30:41.449
<i>The loyal servant you rejected, betrayed?</i>

30:42.840 --> 30:45.127
In 20 minutes, I'm going to kill someone.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.687
It can be your wife...

30:49.080 --> 30:53.130
Oh, but, Damien, you're my first choice.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.125
<i>Ball's in your court, buddy.</i>

30:56.280 --> 30:58.009
<i>Oh, and be quick about it,</i>

30:58.160 --> 31:00.288
<i>because in 21 minutes,</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:04.288
<i>I'm going to blow your little
underground world into next week.</i>

31:04.640 --> 31:05.721
<i>Okay?</i>

31:18.400 --> 31:19.481
So, Machin is down here?

31:19.640 --> 31:21.688
An ongoing pest we've yet to exterminate.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.604
Yeah, he killed Alex, who brought me here

31:23.760 --> 31:26.809
because Ruvé drugged him,
just like you did to me.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.122
We can discuss
my parenting philosophy later.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.084
Mr. Machin is the immediate threat.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.321
To Darhk and his wife,

31:32.480 --> 31:34.005
and I still don't understand
why we should care.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.965
Because he has already tried once
to kill everyone down here.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.366
<i>Malcolm's right.</i>

31:38.520 --> 31:41.000
We're not letting anyone else die.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.566
This place isn't safe.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.849
I need you to get your family out of here
in order to protect them.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.001
Please.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.968
Now, you know the way out.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.724
So, if we can't stop Machin,

31:56.880 --> 31:58.689
then you are going to lead the evacuation.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.730
I don't recall volunteering.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.682
And even if I did,

32:06.840 --> 32:09.207
where exactly would I evacuate them to?

32:10.160 --> 32:13.403
Everything above our heads
is going to be under a mushroom cloud.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.449
I refuse to believe that.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.490
Because you're a fool.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.600
Because I have hope.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.047
Let's go.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.526
Taiana...

32:33.720 --> 32:35.484
lam not just going to
let you kill this man.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.364
I'm the only one who can stop Reiter.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.760
This is how.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.649
I need that man's power.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.643
Listen to yourself. This isn't you.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.167
Whatever that idol is doing,
it is warping your mind!

32:45.320 --> 32:47.607
No. I've never been clearer.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.046
Now, get out of my way!

32:55.560 --> 32:56.561
No, don't!

33:04.400 --> 33:06.243
Déja vu all over again.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.723
You as the bait,
me waiting to kill your husband.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.647
You know, I really hope
I get it right this time.

33:14.320 --> 33:18.325
You have no idea
the power that you're up against.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.286
Look at you.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.761
No longer the whimpering victim.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.844
Mommy's so strong and impressive.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.441
Isn't she?

33:28.600 --> 33:30.807
You do realize
that you're planning to destroy

33:30.960 --> 33:34.851
the last safe place
left on the entire planet, right?

33:35.720 --> 33:37.290
I'm sorry.

33:38.360 --> 33:42.251
Did I leave you with the impression
that I was a rational guy?

33:50.440 --> 33:52.010
That's my mommy.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.366
Isn't she pretty?

33:53.520 --> 33:54.965
Oh, and she brought her friends.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.121
This is over.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.321
<i>More like under.</i>

33:57.720 --> 33:59.290
I tinkered with the engineering here.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.922
This whole place
is powered by a dwarf star alloy.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.128
Very powerful, but a little touchy.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.009
So you might want to
be careful where you aim

34:07.160 --> 34:09.969
because a stray shot
could blow this whole place.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.851
- We're not letting you out of here.
- Oh.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.281
Well, in that case...

34:46.000 --> 34:48.002
Unless you want to die, let's go! Go!

34:48.159 --> 34:49.525
Let's go!

35:21.160 --> 35:22.366
Bye, Mommy.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.728
I got you. Come on. Come on.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.725
There's no time.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.684
Save my daughter.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.606
Please.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.845
Promise me.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.081
I promise.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.720
We need to get out of here,
like, right now.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.044
Finally, Electric Boogaloo awakes.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.771
Sir, there's something
happening at Tevat Noah.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.488
Well, it looks like the real estate value
of the Glades just went up.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.488
It is called gallows humor.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.250
What about everybody else?

36:48.400 --> 36:51.802
I saw Merlyn leading some evacuations.
There must be other access points.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.485
Or Malcolm's underneath all that.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.085
What about her?

36:58.640 --> 36:59.846
Is anyone there?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.126
Green Arrow, Spartan, Speedy?

37:01.320 --> 37:02.685
Hell, I'd take Malcolm Merlyn
at this point.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.970
We're all safe.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.161
Where are you with Rubicon?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.725
HIVE is locked out. We're good.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.810
The city is safe...

37:15.960 --> 37:18.167
You sound like
there's a "but" to that sentence.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.688
People still need saving.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.720
They still need hope.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.685
Give it back!

37:27.840 --> 37:31.686
Taiana, if you want it back,
you're going to have to kill me.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.046
And I'm betting you won't.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.770
And what about me, Mr. Queen?

37:35.640 --> 37:37.927
And after killing you,

37:38.080 --> 37:39.366
I'll kill her.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.651
Tell me.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.562
It was Machin. He's...

38:00.720 --> 38:02.370
Ruvé?

38:04.320 --> 38:05.651
I'm sorry.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.004
My daughter?

38:11.200 --> 38:12.725
We're still getting reports of survivors.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.370
We're locked out of Rubicon.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.561
Momentarily.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.047
I know someone who can get us back online.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.531
Damien...

38:19.680 --> 38:22.047
Tevat Noah is gone.
It's buried under miles of ash.

38:22.200 --> 38:26.046
Even if you could
regain control of Rubicon,

38:26.240 --> 38:29.050
there'd be no place on Earth that is safe.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.609
If there's no place left on Earth
that's safe,

38:38.080 --> 38:40.321
let it all burn.

38:50.680 --> 38:51.681
All right, I'm listening.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.001
Though, if you could
keep the lecture short...

38:53.160 --> 38:54.810
- No lecture.
- I'd appreciate it.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.208
- Just a request.
- Uh-huh.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.249
Leave, and this time,

39:03.800 --> 39:05.086
don't come back.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.771
- What?
- You helped Felicity tonight.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.490
Maybe it was because you'd be nuked, too.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.449
Maybe it was a broken clock
being right for once.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.285
Either way, we both know it wasn't you.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.769
- Dee...
- You know who you are.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.522
Are you really going to stand here

39:24.600 --> 39:26.409
and tell me that you've changed?

39:31.120 --> 39:32.770
You're every bit as dangerous
to our daughter

39:32.920 --> 39:34.604
as the day I took her from you.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.409
If you care about her,

39:39.800 --> 39:42.121
you will walk away.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.771
After everything that's happened,
she'll be crushed.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.480
She'll survive.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.961
She's strong. She's my daughter.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.289
You can lie to her,
but can you lie to yourself?

39:59.400 --> 40:04.008
Can you really believe
that leaving isn't the best thing for her?

40:05.960 --> 40:07.530
<i>What do you think
your parents are talking about?</i>

40:07.680 --> 40:09.330
I'm trying not to think about it.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.404
Maybe they're discussing that thing
that Noah said before

40:12.560 --> 40:14.403
about not having much of a choice.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.005
That's exactly what
I'm trying not to think about.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.128
- Felicity, I helped you save the world.
- Mmm-hmm?

40:18.280 --> 40:19.964
The least you can do
is give me a little gossip.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.690
Okay, fine.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.047
So, apparently...

40:24.840 --> 40:27.366
My dad didn't leave.
My mom kicked him out.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.170
Did she tell you why?

40:29.760 --> 40:32.001
I think she didn't want
to risk him hurting me.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.924
I mean, he could promise
whatever he wanted,

40:34.080 --> 40:37.004
but he was a criminal, is a criminal.

40:37.640 --> 40:41.201
So he inevitably would have
gone back to his old habits.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.361
Mmm-hmm.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.201
What does that mean?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.964
It just sounds familiar, that's all.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.126
The criminal
who you don't think can change,

40:50.280 --> 40:53.887
the slightly overactive
but understandable breakup.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.487
Just saying.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.051
You and Oliver,

40:57.280 --> 40:58.327
Donna and Noah.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.367
Where is Noah?

41:05.440 --> 41:07.090
He's going away for a little while.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.210
That's what you told me when I was seven.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.290
Boo-hoo!

41:15.440 --> 41:16.965
Are you getting all weepy?

41:17.160 --> 41:18.161
Do you need a moment?

41:18.880 --> 41:20.086
No? Good.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.725
'Cause I need you to do me a favor.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.526
Go to hell.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.771
Why bother?

41:26.960 --> 41:29.088
I'm going to bring it to us.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.281
English - SDH
