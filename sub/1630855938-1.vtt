Ronald Silversmith:
In Navajo law enforcement,

00:33.700 --> 00:35.285
in order to survive,

00:35.994 --> 00:38.830
you have to live
the Navajo way of life.

00:39.831 --> 00:44.336
We always have this calling
upon our two twin warriors.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.130
How the story goes is,

00:47.172 --> 00:49.215
you know,
they fought the Yeitso,

00:49.299 --> 00:51.968
the giant monsters
that were out here

00:52.010 --> 00:54.512
that were plaguing Navajoland

00:55.347 --> 00:57.515
so we can live and prosper.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.060
We can live in peace.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.483
But when the last monster
was defeated,

01:06.524 --> 01:09.569
when he was sent back up
into the sky,

01:10.487 --> 01:12.197
he was saying,

01:12.238 --> 01:13.531
"I'm gonna come back...

01:13.615 --> 01:15.367
(thunder rumbling)

01:15.408 --> 01:17.994
Ronald:
"...bringing back the Naayéé',

01:18.036 --> 01:22.582
all the evil
upon our homelands."

01:22.664 --> 01:23.708
(siren wailing)

01:23.792 --> 01:24.959
Ronald:
He was saying,

01:25.585 --> 01:28.420
"I'm gonna take your culture.
I'm gonna take your songs.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.131
"I'm gonna take
your ceremonies.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.008
"You're gonna go
through hunger.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.094
"You're gonna go
through poverty.

01:34.176 --> 01:35.804
All that is gonna come back."

01:36.429 --> 01:40.015
And some elders say
it's here now.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.644
Training officer 1:
Fix it up, recruit.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.437
Fix it up, class 57.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.231
Ronald:
So we teach

01:46.271 --> 01:49.901
our young Navajo recruits
at the academy...

01:49.943 --> 01:51.110
Gary Franklin:
Shooters, stand by.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.737
Ronald:
...to call back upon

01:52.779 --> 01:53.905
the twin warriors...

01:54.239 --> 01:55.490
Sgt. Rob Williams:
Take your time.

01:55.573 --> 02:00.120
Ronald: ...to fight
the monsters of today.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.790
(gunshots)

02:04.332 --> 02:06.292
Ronald:
That warrior spirit,

02:06.376 --> 02:08.919
it gives you the confidence

02:09.003 --> 02:10.672
to protect your people,

02:12.465 --> 02:15.176
but it also gives you
the ability,

02:15.969 --> 02:16.928
if you need to...

02:17.012 --> 02:18.346

02:18.888 --> 02:21.141

Whatever the four clans
that we have

05:22.572 --> 05:24.282
has us tied

and our nation
through thick and thin.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.121
No matter where you go,
you have that family tree

We're taught at a young age

05:44.177 --> 05:46.137
everybody is your relative

05:46.221 --> 05:49.641
and to have kinship and k'é.

05:49.724 --> 05:54.521
K'é is that universal unity
between Diné people.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.981
It's like me going up
to a random stranger

05:57.065 --> 05:58.400
and I'm willing
to help them out

05:58.483 --> 06:00.610
because k'é means
that you have

06:00.652 --> 06:02.320

to one another.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.165
that happen here

Eugenia Charles-Newton: This is
the Law and Order committee

06:20.672 --> 06:23.508
for the 24th Navajo Nation
Council irregular meeting,

06:23.591 --> 06:27.012
ready to provide a report
regarding police

06:27.053 --> 06:28.471
and public safety.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.183
Speaker:
A young man shot into vehicles,

06:32.267 --> 06:34.519
occupied residences,

06:34.561 --> 06:38.648
and the police, uh, didn't come
for several days.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.653
(in English)

06:45.405 --> 06:47.741
Navajo PD was called.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.534
"We can't make it out."

06:50.784 --> 06:51.870
That's crazy.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.205
That's crazy.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.417
Speaker 2: And all we heard was
"Stop being mad at us."

06:57.500 --> 06:59.711
That's the attitude
that we receive out here.

06:59.794 --> 07:03.214
How many more years are we
gonna be in this situation?

07:03.840 --> 07:07.427
Eugenia: The law and
order committee receives calls

07:07.510 --> 07:09.387
about the response time.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.182
You know, officers,
takes them forever to respond.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.101
We're out of control...
(speaking Navajo)

07:15.185 --> 07:18.229
Eugenia: But the fact is
we don't have enough officers

07:18.271 --> 07:19.731
to do the job.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.568
(siren wailing)

07:23.651 --> 07:27.739
An increase in criminal activity
has come upon us.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.576
Violent crimes,
increase in bootlegging,

07:31.659 --> 07:36.039
drugs, gang activity,
drive-by shootings,

07:36.247 --> 07:37.499
missing persons.

07:38.457 --> 07:41.419
Phillip Francisco:
The Navajo Nation is
a very large land base.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.504
We're the largest tribe
in the United States.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.631
We have 27,000 square miles

07:44.714 --> 07:46.383
of territory that we have
to patrol.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.718
You know,
it's the size of West Virginia.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.096
Daryl Noon:
We recently had an assessment

07:51.137 --> 07:53.264
that found in order to offer

07:53.348 --> 07:55.558
the basic police services

07:55.600 --> 07:59.270
we would need
at least 500 officers.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.231
Right now, we have 180.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.026
But when you start trimming
those numbers down

08:05.110 --> 08:08.238
to actual
on-the-ground patrol officers

08:08.279 --> 08:10.031
responding to calls,

08:10.365 --> 08:13.952
we're looking more
down to 130.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.330
(dog barking)

08:17.414 --> 08:19.874
I'm sending resources
to assist you, okay?

08:19.957 --> 08:22.127
Sgt. Williams: I don't think the
public generally understands,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.879
well, we're also working
a stabbing over here,

08:24.963 --> 08:27.424
or we have a medical
emergency over there,

08:27.465 --> 08:29.634
so it's hard
and sometimes heartbreaking

08:29.718 --> 08:31.803
to go to these calls
and tell people,

08:31.845 --> 08:34.097
"I'm sorry I couldn't
get here sooner."

08:36.765 --> 08:38.308
Sgt. Williams: Okay,
you just got to call us back.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.020
And that's just,
that's how it is.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.149
Sgt. Dan: We have to travel
huge distances,

08:44.232 --> 08:47.402
and because of
the low numbers of officers,

08:47.485 --> 08:49.446
most of us are by ourselves.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.823
Officer:
Navajo Police.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.117
So sometimes we end up
way out there

08:54.159 --> 08:55.910
and our backup is probably

08:55.994 --> 08:58.663
45 minutes,
even an hour, sometimes.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.832
35, Chinle, location?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.626
Sgt. Williams:
To make things worse,

09:03.668 --> 09:06.254
we don't always have
radio communications.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
(static crackling)

09:08.131 --> 09:09.174
Location?

09:09.841 --> 09:11.968
Sgt. Williams: Our lives are
at stake, quite frankly.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.137
News Anchor:
There have been five

09:14.220 --> 09:15.680
Navajo Nation police officers

09:15.764 --> 09:18.850
shot in the line of duty
in the past three years.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.020
Daryl: We were already
shorthanded all these years,

09:22.771 --> 09:25.690
but then you add on to that,
you know, COVID hit.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.192
News Anchor 2:
Well, The Navajo Nation has

09:27.275 --> 09:30.528
the highest infection rate
in the United States.

09:31.196 --> 09:35.116
Daryl: We were not sufficiently
staffed to handle that.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.034
Phillip:
As time goes on,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.577
it's really getting
more difficult

09:37.660 --> 09:40.163
to find people
that want to do this job.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.915
Officer:
Column left. Hard.

09:43.540 --> 09:47.253
Speaker:
This is a very special day
for the Navajo Police Academy

09:47.337 --> 09:49.714
Class 56.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.716
You have a big task ahead of you

09:51.758 --> 09:55.053
going from recruits
to police officers.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.889
I challenge every class
for everybody to pass,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.558
but, you know, they haven't
fulfilled that yet,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.019
but this is what it is.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.564
Sgt. Williams: From my point
of view, I think it's dire.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
The number of officers
we graduate per class

10:08.692 --> 10:10.985
since I've been here
the most have been 19.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.239
This last class was 12.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.032
Lt. Donnie Kee:
It's been a rough couple years

10:16.116 --> 10:17.409
for the Navajo Nation,

10:17.492 --> 10:18.702
and I think the general vibe is

10:18.743 --> 10:20.578
you know,
we're ready to move forward.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.247
(officer speaking Navajo)

10:22.288 --> 10:23.373
Lt. Kee:
But the obstacles

10:23.415 --> 10:25.208
and the challenges
of Navajo Nation

10:25.250 --> 10:28.712
are uniquely different than
anywhere else in the country.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.380
It's generational.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.451
'cause a bunch
of them are coming

12:23.535 --> 12:24.994
to your district, Koho.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.997
(laughter)

12:28.039 --> 12:30.125
Sgt. Williams:
I was working in Page PD

12:30.208 --> 12:32.002
pushing a radio car back then,

12:32.043 --> 12:34.879
and I could hear
the Navajo PD units

12:34.963 --> 12:36.715
on the other side
of the imaginary line.

12:36.798 --> 12:37.924
They were just--

12:38.008 --> 12:38.925
They sounded like
they were having

12:39.009 --> 12:40.218
a good time out there.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.013
(laughter)

12:43.054 --> 12:45.223
Sgt. Williams: They would get
into some precarious situations

12:45.306 --> 12:46.725
so they were tight.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.144
They had an ingrained sense
of community,

12:49.227 --> 12:51.187
and I have yet
to meet an officer

12:51.229 --> 12:52.689
who doesn't have that
in their heart

12:52.731 --> 12:54.065
here at Navajo PD.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.066
It's like...

12:55.400 --> 12:57.444
I don't know,
it's just kind of heartwarming,

12:57.527 --> 12:59.195
for lack of a better word.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.614
Class:
Class 57 requesting permission

13:01.698 --> 13:04.034
to enter the classroom,
instructor!

13:05.410 --> 13:06.745
Lt. Kee:
It is unique

13:07.328 --> 13:10.290
with Navajo officers
policing Navajo people.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.918
Th-there's no, uh,
there's no color involved.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.211
People don't see color.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.214
You know,
I mean most of the officers

13:18.256 --> 13:20.925
police an area
in which they live.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.928
This establishes
some level of rapport

13:24.346 --> 13:28.600
as it relates to Navajo clanship
or k'é, uh, family.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.477
Recruit:
Attention on deck!

13:32.687 --> 13:33.605
Lt. Kee:
Have a seat.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.231
Class:
Sir, thank you, sir.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.067
I'm Lieutenant Donnie Kee.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.151
I'm the training commander here

13:38.234 --> 13:40.820
at Navajo Police
Training Academy.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.865
The attrition rate
is roughly 50%,

13:43.948 --> 13:47.577
meaning that with 28 people
starting this academy,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.205
what's the expectation
that we're gonna graduate

13:50.288 --> 13:51.289
how many?

13:51.748 --> 13:52.999
Class:
Sir, 14, sir.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.334
Lt. Kee:
Fourteen.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.296
And 14 is not enough

13:58.338 --> 14:01.966
to provide any kind
of decent relief

14:02.050 --> 14:04.511
to the bodies that are working
the streets right now.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.640
And so my job is to change
that attrition rate

14:08.723 --> 14:11.810
to 20%.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.729
So there's a large amount
of discipline

14:14.813 --> 14:18.066
that you will have
to exercise here.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.860
I've learned over
the course of my career

14:21.444 --> 14:25.448
that nothing worthwhile
is accomplished in comfort.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.034
From the day you were born

14:28.118 --> 14:29.953
to the day you die,

14:29.994 --> 14:32.038
that is gonna hold true.

14:32.497 --> 14:37.669
You need to get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.879
Does everybody understand that?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.464
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.175
Lt. Kee: I spent 20 years
in law enforcement

14:44.259 --> 14:47.012
in the state of New Mexico
and had retired.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.557
I was retired for a whopping
three and a half weeks,

14:50.640 --> 14:53.059
um, and in that three weeks,
I fished quite a bit

14:53.143 --> 14:55.437
and I almost struggled
for, for a little bit

14:55.520 --> 14:59.441
and really almost lost
a sense of purpose.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.483
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.235
Everybody's got a job, smile.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.319
It's a good day.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.530
Everybody's getting paid
to work out.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.990
How awesome is that?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.868
High skips. High skips.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.204
I grew up on the reservation
and I-I went away,

15:13.246 --> 15:17.917
and I missed hearing
the Navajo language spoken.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.838
I missed hearing people laugh,
just Navajo people laugh,

15:22.339 --> 15:25.133
and the way that people
took care of each other.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.302
(laughing)

15:27.385 --> 15:31.056
And so I'm really happy
to be able to come back here

15:31.097 --> 15:35.393
because I'm able to contribute,
uh, with what, what I can.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.563
And that's,
that's everything to me.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.024
You represent everyone
that has ever worn

15:41.066 --> 15:43.693
that uniform
by your presence here.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.653
I know that our goal
is 500 officers

15:45.737 --> 15:46.738
in the next five years.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.281
Recruit:
Detail. Halt.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.991
Lt. Kee:
If we could hit that mark,

15:50.033 --> 15:52.702
I think that that would give
Navajo people in general

15:52.744 --> 15:54.913
some, some pride
in, in the fact

15:54.996 --> 15:56.539
that we're,
we're moving forward.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.585
Would be amazing to see
that many officers here.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.713
Shawvan:
Class,

16:03.755 --> 16:06.591
Recruit Largo,
Recruit Garcia,

16:07.050 --> 16:10.261
and Recruit Cattleman
for a color detail.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.430
-Lt. Kee: He's a good kid.
-He is.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.809
Lt. Kee:
I hope he makes it this time.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.728
Just get him to calm down
on the range.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.617
Firearms instructor:
Alright, you ready?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.578
Slow motion.
Take your time.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.247
Go ahead and draw.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.040
Get a feel of the motion.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.044
Okay. Alright.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.755
So do you feel anything
that you can improve

16:45.797 --> 16:47.173
just off your draw?

16:48.299 --> 16:49.342
Um...

16:52.470 --> 16:54.222
Firearms instructor:
You can holster up.

16:54.764 --> 16:55.932
Shawvan:
No, not that I know.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.225
Firearms instructor:
Okay, let's try it again.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.728
Nice and slow.
Ready? Draw.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.189
Shawvan: When I first attended
the academy

17:03.273 --> 17:06.276
with the last class,
class 56,

17:06.568 --> 17:09.779
I just did the best
I could, studied.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.321
The firearms came--

17:11.406 --> 17:13.074
Firearms instructor:
Relax. (exhales forcefully)

17:13.157 --> 17:14.492
Breathe, relax.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.036
-(gunshot)
-There you go.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.871
Shawvan:
The third qualification,

17:18.496 --> 17:21.458
my last chance,
I didn't make it.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.126
Like you guys kept telling us,

17:23.167 --> 17:25.002
don't look at your target
after shooting.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.003
Yeah. Yeah.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.005
Shawvan:
That's what I kept doing,

17:27.047 --> 17:29.215
and the last three shots

17:29.299 --> 17:31.176
I pulled the trigger
and it jerked...

17:31.259 --> 17:32.385
-Yeah. Yeah.
-...and it went off,

17:32.469 --> 17:33.470
and I missed it.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.348
All I could think about
was, "Shoot."

17:36.431 --> 17:38.475
Like, "What's my family
going to think?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.393
"What is my girlfriend
going to think?

17:40.477 --> 17:42.729
"How am I going to tell them
that I failed?

17:42.812 --> 17:45.982
"How am I going to tell them
that, uh, I-I can't go on

17:46.024 --> 17:47.984
into police academy?"

17:48.360 --> 17:50.487
Stephanie Sanisya:
You guys want to put the tinsel

17:50.528 --> 17:51.529
on the tree with us?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.031
Boy: What do we do
with these things?

17:53.114 --> 17:54.532
(giggles)

17:54.616 --> 17:55.909
Just grab like that.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.452
-Not-- uh, not that much.
-Shawvan: Oh.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.871
Stephanie: You only need, like,
a couple of strands.

17:59.913 --> 18:00.914
Shawvan:
Oh.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.083
Stephanie:
That's very pretty.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.212
He called me, and he was sad.
I could hear it.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.799
Once he walked in the door,
you know,

18:10.882 --> 18:13.259
we just hugged,
and I told him

18:13.343 --> 18:14.636
I was still proud of him.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.264
Um... sorry.
(chuckles)

18:19.224 --> 18:21.893
I know how he felt
in that moment.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.772
He worked so hard
to reach that point.

18:26.481 --> 18:30.777
He didn't want to get
emotional at the range,

18:30.860 --> 18:33.113
but he ended up crying
at home.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.282
Firearms instructor:
So pay attention to how
I get back on target.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.659
My eyes don't move
from that site.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.493
It stays on target, right?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.578
I'm focused
on that deadly force.

18:40.662 --> 18:41.871
(gunshots)

18:42.288 --> 18:44.541
Shawvan:
I'm coming back into class 57

18:44.624 --> 18:46.084
with more confidence

18:46.126 --> 18:49.087
that I can, I can do it
and that I will pass.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.715
But in the back of my mind,
I'm just like,

18:51.756 --> 18:55.427
"What if-if-if I,
I don't make it this time?"

18:55.885 --> 18:58.805
"Cause I know everything
isn't always gonna be

18:58.888 --> 19:01.224
the way you want it to be.

19:01.933 --> 19:05.311
That last shot, you jerked it
to the right, okay?

19:10.608 --> 19:12.235
Sgt. Dan:
Homework assignments.

19:12.277 --> 19:16.114
When you guys are given
a date, a due date,

19:16.156 --> 19:17.449
get it done.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.702
Sgt. Williams: Big part of
this job is time management,

19:20.785 --> 19:23.329
so find the time,
and this will probably be

19:23.413 --> 19:24.914
one of the last times
I'm going to talk to you

19:24.956 --> 19:27.250
in this manner, right?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.794
'Cause if-- you're gonna
get Sergeant Williams out,

19:31.087 --> 19:32.297
and you don't want that.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.340
Wyndean Largo:
Sir, yes, sir.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.841
Sgt. Williams:
So what happened

19:34.924 --> 19:36.301
to you, Largo?

19:38.803 --> 19:40.263
Sgt. Williams: How much
livestock are we talking about?

19:40.305 --> 19:41.931
Yellowstone Ranch livestock?

19:41.973 --> 19:42.974
Largo:
Four horses, sir.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.100
Sgt. Williams:
Four-- Okay.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.393
Well, horses aren't easy.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.645
But still, you honestly look
at me in the eye

19:47.687 --> 19:51.066
and tell me that you
couldn't find 30 minutes

19:51.149 --> 19:53.860
in your entire weekend.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.695
Largo:
I could have done it, sir.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.030
Sgt. Williams:
So find the time

19:57.113 --> 19:58.323
because like I said,

19:58.365 --> 19:59.991
this is the first step
out the door,

20:00.492 --> 20:02.160
and there's no reason
to lose you guys

20:02.202 --> 20:04.496
to something like this.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.498
Alright? Do you have
any questions about it?

20:07.290 --> 20:08.249
Largo:
Sir, no, sir.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.585
Sgt. Williams:
My first class that I was here,

20:10.669 --> 20:12.837
all my peers had been
through a few classes,

20:12.879 --> 20:14.130
and I was very green.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.173
I'm like, "Oh, they're all
gonna make it.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.257
"Look at them.
They're all excited.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.175
"They're all motivated.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.301
They're all determined."

20:18.343 --> 20:19.886
And then they laugh at me.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.389
Some people aren't
prepared mentally,

20:22.472 --> 20:25.308
emotionally to deal with it
in the long run,

20:25.350 --> 20:27.018
so they-they leave.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.812
And we've already seen it here

20:28.853 --> 20:33.024
at the start of class 57
with a couple folks.

20:33.108 --> 20:36.027
Day one is usually the day

20:36.111 --> 20:38.405
that we have people quit.

20:38.488 --> 20:42.367
You know, one, two, but this
is only orientation week,

20:42.450 --> 20:44.244
and then we've got four
that left.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.537
I don't know. It's not--

20:45.620 --> 20:47.872
We haven't even gotten
to the hard part yet, so...

20:47.956 --> 20:49.833
Sgt. Williams:
I think they mindfuck
themselves, honestly.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.752
These people,
they have tons of potential

20:52.836 --> 20:55.296
and we can see it in them,

20:55.797 --> 20:59.467
but it just depends on why
you're here to begin with.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.095
Instructor:
Come on, Pettigrew.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.430
-Speaker: Go! Go!
-(whistle blows)

21:03.513 --> 21:05.223
Cheyenne Pettigrew:
I was taking classes

21:05.306 --> 21:07.017
at community college.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.059
Sgt. Dan:
You got it. Come on.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.477
Cheyenne:
And also working

21:09.561 --> 21:12.147
as a Navajo Nation
police dispatcher,

21:12.230 --> 21:13.356
(whistle blows)

21:13.398 --> 21:14.899
So when I'm sitting there
in dispatch

21:14.983 --> 21:18.528
and there's no backup
or everyone's on call

21:18.570 --> 21:20.238
and there's another call
for help,

21:20.780 --> 21:25.076
there's no one to send
and it's really frustrating.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.453
(chuckles)

21:26.536 --> 21:27.912
Sgt. Dan:
There you go.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.080
Sgt. Williams:
By and large,

21:29.122 --> 21:30.749
they're pretty young.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.709
(laughter)

21:32.751 --> 21:35.086
Antwan Gray:
I wanted to play college ball.

21:35.670 --> 21:39.090
I couldn't go with that process
because my wife was pregnant.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.925
I got her pregnant
my senior year.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.177
Sgt. Dan:
Come on, Gray.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.721
Antwan: This was the job
I had to wait for

21:44.763 --> 21:46.139
until I was 21,

21:46.890 --> 21:50.226
and I'm willing to put
my life at risk,

21:50.268 --> 21:53.646
even though I have a family,
to go help people.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.774
Um...

21:56.107 --> 21:57.067
I'm pretty scared though.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.902
(nervous laughter)

21:58.943 --> 22:00.862
Sgt. Williams: How are you doing
this morning, Julius?

22:00.945 --> 22:02.155
We occasionally have...

22:02.238 --> 22:03.448
You know,
we always tease them, aw,

22:03.490 --> 22:05.492
it's the grandma or the grandpa
who comes through,

22:05.575 --> 22:08.912
and that's usually just somebody
in their thirties maybe.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.747
(indistinct shouting)

22:10.789 --> 22:12.290
Julius Billy:
Prior to this,

22:12.332 --> 22:14.459
I was a rail operator.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.879
The company was, um, shut down

22:17.921 --> 22:19.923
due to the current pandemic.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.343
Sgt. Dan:
Billy, lock your elbows out.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.428
Julius:
You know, I got two kids

22:25.470 --> 22:27.472
so you have
to find that job.

22:27.972 --> 22:31.017
What else is out there for me
that I can, I can do?

22:31.101 --> 22:32.227
Sgt. Dan:
Ready!

22:32.310 --> 22:33.812
Julius:
I'm on the older side here.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.147
It's a challenge
running against

22:36.231 --> 22:38.400
these younger
20-year-olds, you know?

22:38.483 --> 22:39.526
Lt. Kee:
Fight!

22:39.818 --> 22:41.569
-(fighters grunting)
-(punches thudding)

22:41.653 --> 22:42.987
Recruit:
Let's go, Billy.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.781
Julius:
Uh, it's gonna be

22:45.281 --> 22:48.326
a long, rough road ahead.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.078
That's all I can say.
It's gonna be tough.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.371
Recruit:
Let's go, Billy.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.455
Julius:
I already see that.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.207
Sgt. Williams: Alright,
it's done, it's done,

22:54.290 --> 22:56.167
it's done, it's done.

22:56.251 --> 22:59.045
Recruit:
One, two, three.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.130
Class:
Seven.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.381
Sgt. Williams:
Some people really want

23:01.464 --> 23:03.258
to be here,
and they really want to serve.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.175
Class:
Eight.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.135
Sgt. Williams:
Some of you need

23:05.176 --> 23:06.386
to get your hair cut,

23:06.761 --> 23:09.180
and now because
of dinks like that,

23:09.723 --> 23:12.017
all of you will shave
your head

23:12.100 --> 23:13.768
like Too Tall here.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.521
Take a look.
I know you can see him.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.565
William Sloan:
They call me Too Tall.

23:18.648 --> 23:19.983
(laughs)

23:20.025 --> 23:20.900
The beginning of this year,

23:20.984 --> 23:22.819
I was actually working
in Portland,

23:22.861 --> 23:24.988
and that was pretty much
no choice for me.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.198
You know, I had to provide
for my family

23:27.282 --> 23:28.575
so that's why I had to leave.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.869
And then as soon as I got work
closer to home,

23:30.952 --> 23:32.287
I took the opportunity,

23:32.370 --> 23:34.205
and it all led
to me coming here.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.082
Lt. Kee:
If you haven't figured it out,

23:36.166 --> 23:39.336
the shortest distance
between two points is what?

23:39.878 --> 23:42.714
Straight line.
Not like this.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.592
We're not building houses
on the Navajo Nation.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.344
-(class laughs)
-Lt. Kee: Right? Alright.

23:47.385 --> 23:50.055
William: I've always actually
wanted to be a police officer

23:50.096 --> 23:51.097
since I was little.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.265
Lt. Kee:
Come on, Sloan.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.060
William: Growing up, we had
some pretty crazy neighbors

23:55.143 --> 23:56.311
around the neighborhood.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.729
Lot of trouble
that was going on.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.522
We didn't have a man
in the house to stand up

23:59.564 --> 24:00.815
to several people
that would be,

24:00.899 --> 24:03.109
like, raising their voices
or being physical,

24:03.485 --> 24:06.112
and the cops would show up.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.490
It was kind of inspirational
how I would see them,

24:08.573 --> 24:10.784
like, just, like, approach
the situation, you know?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.660
They didn't do anything
physical or anything.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.371
They just walked over there
well-mannered

24:14.412 --> 24:16.081
and handled the situation.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.333
You see a lot of people
on the reservation

24:18.416 --> 24:19.417
that need help too.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.460
Recruit:
Good job, Allen.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.087
Speaker:
Let's go hustle, hustle!

24:22.128 --> 24:23.546
William: So that's why
I'd love to be a cop.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.839
Speaker 2:
There you go!

24:24.923 --> 24:26.466
Speaker 3: It's all about speed
right here, Clitso.

24:26.549 --> 24:27.967
William: I have
my cousin brother here.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.095
-Deshane Begay.
-Sgt. Dan: Go.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.430
(grunts)

24:32.472 --> 24:33.807
William:
My mom and his father,

24:33.890 --> 24:35.517
they're brothers and sisters

24:35.600 --> 24:37.519
but the first two clans
of ours are the same.

24:37.602 --> 24:38.645
Which is Naakai Dine'é.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.980
Yeah, that's what
makes us brothers.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.399
Sgt. Dan:
Side.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.942
William: I told him about
the police academy

24:44.025 --> 24:45.402
and he signed up too.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.571
He was kind of iffy
about coming but, you know,

24:48.613 --> 24:50.615
I was like, "Hey, man,
if I go and I finish,

24:50.657 --> 24:51.825
you got to go
and finish with me too,"

24:51.908 --> 24:53.952
and he took that
big step with me.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.621
(sheep bleating)

24:58.998 --> 25:00.083
(kid babbles)

25:00.125 --> 25:01.376
(water sloshing)

25:01.459 --> 25:02.460
Water.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.878
Kid:
Mm, wa-yer.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.048
William: I'm a family person.
I have a wife and son.

25:07.132 --> 25:08.299
(sheep bleating)

25:08.383 --> 25:11.553
Before I joined the academy,
I had a lot going on, you know.

25:11.636 --> 25:14.556
I just lost my mom last year
due to COVID, so...

25:15.056 --> 25:17.100
And a lot of people
that I was close to,

25:17.142 --> 25:18.935
like my grandparents,
they passed away,

25:18.977 --> 25:21.438
and a lot of my knowledge
that I carry on today

25:21.479 --> 25:23.148
was carried off
from my grandparents.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.483
Did grandma tell you what we're
gonna do with the storage?

25:25.525 --> 25:28.028
No? She told, she told me
to take it down.

25:28.486 --> 25:29.571
-Deshane: Really?
-Yeah.

25:29.654 --> 25:30.780
She wants you
to save me this top,

25:30.822 --> 25:34.159
the roof here
and save it for these guys.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.161
Deshane: Remember there's like
two black ones

25:36.244 --> 25:37.537
and then, like,
two white ones

25:37.620 --> 25:39.706
and they both end up dying,
all four of them.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.499
William: See, that's why we need
to double this thing

25:41.583 --> 25:43.877
'cause these guys are
gonna start doubling quick.

25:44.169 --> 25:45.045
Deshane:
Oh, yeah.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.339
William: They taught me
a lot of things about, like,

25:47.380 --> 25:48.548
how to take care
of your family,

25:48.631 --> 25:50.008
how to take care of yourself.

25:50.508 --> 25:51.593
You just got to watch
over everyone.

25:51.676 --> 25:52.927
The same way
you take care of yourself

25:53.011 --> 25:55.180
is how you should watch
over your people.

25:56.181 --> 25:58.183
My father's side,
they're traditional.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.352
They still participate
in the traditional ways

26:00.435 --> 26:01.603
of ceremonies and stuff,

26:01.686 --> 26:03.063
like how we wake up
in the morning.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.856
You know, some people
are traditional,

26:04.939 --> 26:06.858
they pray to the sun
as it comes up, so...

26:06.900 --> 26:08.568
And I'm one of those people.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.236
You know, when the sun's
come up, I'm,

26:10.320 --> 26:11.363
I'm praying to the sun

26:11.738 --> 26:12.781
'cause, you know,
that's kind of

26:12.864 --> 26:15.742
like, good blessings
to yourself.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.827
But I also respect
the Christianity side

26:17.869 --> 26:20.663
just because my mom's side,
we're Christians.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.457
Recruit:
What are we giving out next?

26:22.999 --> 26:25.210
William: My mom always knew
that I wanted to be a cop too.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.504
Like, I've always used to talk
to her about it,

26:27.545 --> 26:28.838
but I used to tell her, like,

26:28.880 --> 26:30.757
I'm not, like,
mentally there for it.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.509
So now that I feel like

26:32.550 --> 26:34.219
I'm, like,
mentally there, like,

26:34.260 --> 26:35.762
I feel like I can do this.

26:36.888 --> 26:38.348
Training officer:
Fix yourself!

26:39.474 --> 26:41.059
Speaker:
Help each other out.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.227
Thank you, man.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.729
William: It means
a lot to me, you know,

26:44.771 --> 26:47.399
being a cop that protects
his own community.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.441
Thank you, sir.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.526
You're part
of the reservation,

26:49.567 --> 26:50.568
and, you know, like, people

26:50.652 --> 26:51.778
that leave off
the reservation,

26:51.861 --> 26:53.530
they start losing
their culture too.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.073
And if you live
on the reservation,

26:55.156 --> 26:56.491
you know,
your culture's still alive.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.410
You see it everywhere.
You see it around you.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.913
(Class speaking Navajo)

27:01.955 --> 27:04.082
Recruit:
Good, ready, begin.

27:04.165 --> 27:08.044
(class speaking Navajo)

27:17.262 --> 27:19.764
Sgt. Dan: Day one is only gonna
be hard for you

27:19.806 --> 27:21.349
if you make it hard.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.184
Don't even think of it
as being hard.

27:23.268 --> 27:26.354
Just-just get it done.
That's all you got to do.

27:26.896 --> 27:29.357
Sgt. Williams: Don't do anything
stupid this weekend.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.569
Don't go out and get drunk,
do anything dumb.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.820
Your lifestyles are changing

27:33.903 --> 27:35.530
as you enter
into this profession.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.158
You won't be at the end
of this training,

27:38.241 --> 27:40.535
nor do you get to be
the same person you were

27:40.618 --> 27:42.162
when you enter this profession.

27:42.245 --> 27:43.621
It's just not possible.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.665
So have those high standards

27:45.749 --> 27:47.417
so you can hold
your head up high

27:47.834 --> 27:50.128
when you've earned that shield

27:50.628 --> 27:53.089
and you start
your field training program.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.177
Steady yourselves.

27:57.719 --> 28:01.056
It's gonna be a busy day,
it's gonna be chaotic.

28:01.139 --> 28:02.932
If you're determined,
you'll get through it

28:03.892 --> 28:05.352
if you don't quit on yourself.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.479
We're not gonna quit
on you ever.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.647
Shawvan:
Class, attention!

28:09.689 --> 28:11.608
-(feet stomping)
-Class: Never back down!

28:11.649 --> 28:13.485
Never quit!
Always commit!

28:13.526 --> 28:15.320
Class 57.

28:15.362 --> 28:16.571
Shawvan:
Fall out.

28:16.988 --> 28:22.744
Sgt. Williams:
Five, four, three, two, one.

28:23.787 --> 28:26.039
And that's all she wrote
for this week.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.296
(spray hissing)

28:33.338 --> 28:36.800
(woman humming)

28:37.550 --> 28:39.302
(spray hissing)

28:39.344 --> 28:42.222
Nora Allen: Clitso, you stink
but not that bad, okay?

28:42.305 --> 28:44.265
(laughter)

28:44.349 --> 28:45.433
Nora:
I'm kidding.

28:47.352 --> 28:51.189
I brought my other flashlights,
but they're already dead.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.108
Roberta Clitso: How long
did you have it on?

28:53.191 --> 28:54.734
Well, I used them
the other night

28:54.818 --> 28:56.361
kind of like on and off

28:56.695 --> 28:59.114
just 'cause I was, like,
packing too, so...

29:01.574 --> 29:03.201
It's just been go, go, go.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.328
I mean,
I couldn't even do, like,

29:05.370 --> 29:07.706
one situp when I got here.

29:07.872 --> 29:10.041
Did you work out, like,
before you got here or not?

29:10.125 --> 29:11.751
Roberta:
I worked out here and there,

29:11.835 --> 29:14.879
but I had to work till,
like, up to my last day.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.715
I slept at the house,
I packed up my stuff

29:16.798 --> 29:18.299
and I came out here.

29:19.551 --> 29:24.556
I think it's just having to come
to terms that this is...

29:25.807 --> 29:26.725
this is our life.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.435
It's just gonna be go, go, go.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.356
(animal howling)

29:48.913 --> 29:51.708
Recruit 1:
Does anybody need a clip-on tie?

29:51.750 --> 29:52.959
Recruit 2:
Here.

29:54.252 --> 29:55.295
Thanks, man.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.257
Shawvan: Let's go!
We only have 10 minutes!

30:02.969 --> 30:05.597
Cheyenne:
Allen, I have a extra one.

30:06.222 --> 30:07.766
Recruit:
Hey, Pettigrew. Thank you.

30:07.849 --> 30:08.933
Cheyenne:
Yay!

30:09.392 --> 30:12.437
Shawvan: Did you guys bring
your PT gear and everything?

30:12.520 --> 30:14.105
Class:
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

30:15.273 --> 30:17.275
Recruit: Are we marching down
there or are we just (inaudible)

30:17.359 --> 30:18.651
Shawvan: No, we're just
running down there.

30:18.735 --> 30:19.778
Recruit:
Yes, sir.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.112
Shawvan:
Let's head on out.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.165
(indistinct shouting)

30:37.754 --> 30:40.173
Present arms!

30:43.468 --> 30:45.011
Dress right, dress.

30:47.931 --> 30:51.643
Remember, we sound off
on the class motto, okay?

30:51.685 --> 30:52.852
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.980
Shawvan: Since I had
13 weeks of experience

30:56.064 --> 30:57.941
with the academy before,

30:57.982 --> 31:00.819
I do feel like I take on
a bigger role coming into this

31:00.902 --> 31:04.823
because I do expect myself
to not only graduate

31:04.864 --> 31:06.658
but to also be that leader.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.577
Platoon, attention!

31:10.036 --> 31:12.372
They do kind of ask me like,

31:12.455 --> 31:14.791
"Hey, how was it?
How is this?"

31:14.874 --> 31:18.503
And seeing on their face
that they're nervous,

31:18.545 --> 31:21.339
that they're scared but they
don't want to admit it,

31:21.965 --> 31:24.592
I open up to them and tell them,
"Hey, it's, it's okay."

31:24.676 --> 31:26.803
It's all about that support.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.847
Today's gonna be the day
where they want

31:28.888 --> 31:30.348
to see us all work together.

31:30.390 --> 31:32.058
Somebody's struggling,
help them out.

31:32.517 --> 31:35.186
Somebody's falling behind,
push them, motivate each other

31:35.228 --> 31:37.564
because that's exactly
the way it's gonna be

31:37.647 --> 31:38.690
when we get out
on the road.

31:39.441 --> 31:42.027
Brothers and sisters,
that's what we are.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.112
This academy is gonna
be like that.

31:44.195 --> 31:47.157
The whole 28 weeks
is when we have each other.

31:47.198 --> 31:50.410
As you guys know,
we're dwindling down in size

31:50.493 --> 31:53.747
as police officers
around the Navajo Nation.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.665
So at the end of the day,

31:55.707 --> 31:58.376
I want to see everybody
that's here now,

31:58.418 --> 32:00.211
still here tomorrow.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.921
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

32:03.798 --> 32:05.258
(laughter)

32:05.342 --> 32:07.260
Sgt. Williams: You're about
to live the rookie dream.

32:07.344 --> 32:09.304
Just walk up to him
and be like...

32:09.679 --> 32:10.722
(whispering)
"You're gonna die."

32:10.764 --> 32:12.849
(laughter)

32:12.932 --> 32:14.476
Training officer:
Biggest mistake of your life.

32:14.559 --> 32:15.685
Help me.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.395
Sgt. Williams:
You're fucked up.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.066
(laughter)

32:21.107 --> 32:22.067
Sgt. Williams:
Alright.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.068
Shannon was kind enough

32:23.109 --> 32:24.527
to bring some Halls.

32:24.986 --> 32:28.114
Take some, remember,
push from your diaphragm,

32:28.198 --> 32:29.574
don't use your throat.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.076
Training officer:
Let's go!

32:31.159 --> 32:33.286
(indistinct shouting)

32:33.370 --> 32:36.081
(siren wailing)

32:36.164 --> 32:38.291
Sgt. Williams:
Fall in over here!

32:38.792 --> 32:40.001
Fucking idiot.

32:40.085 --> 32:43.421
What are you doing?
Inside!

32:43.463 --> 32:44.422
Split it up!

32:44.464 --> 32:47.967
You were advised
to have your gear out!

32:48.051 --> 32:49.386
Go get it!

32:49.469 --> 32:53.848
(overlapping shouting)

32:53.932 --> 32:54.933
Sgt. Williams:
Work together!

32:55.016 --> 32:56.643
Go fuck yourself.

32:57.268 --> 33:00.063
For fuck's sake,
double arm intervals!

33:00.105 --> 33:01.231
Are you even listening?

33:01.272 --> 33:03.650
Sgt. Dan:
Who told you guys what to do?

33:05.819 --> 33:06.820
Sgt. Dan:
Move!

33:06.903 --> 33:08.780
Sgt. Williams:
Dump all your stuff out.

33:08.863 --> 33:10.115
Sgt. Dan:
Grab your backpack.

33:10.156 --> 33:14.327
(indistinct shouting)

33:14.411 --> 33:15.954
Sgt. Dan:
Are you fucking kidding me?!

33:16.037 --> 33:17.288
(indistinct shouting)

33:17.372 --> 33:20.166
Give me your duty belt, now!

33:20.583 --> 33:22.794
(indistinct shouting)

33:22.836 --> 33:24.879
Sgt. Dan:
Give me your belt, now!

33:25.296 --> 33:26.965
Sgt. Williams:
Your duty belt!

33:27.048 --> 33:29.467
Nobody wants
your personal belt.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.221
Sgt. Dan:
Where's your belt?

33:33.638 --> 33:34.848
Shawvan: Ma'am, I didn't think
we needed it

33:34.931 --> 33:36.057
for the first day, ma'am.

33:36.141 --> 33:37.058
Sgt. Dan:
You would leave your home

33:37.142 --> 33:38.435
without your belt,

33:39.144 --> 33:41.980
without your gun, without
any equipment to help you?

33:42.022 --> 33:43.815
Shawvan: Ma'am,
there's no excuses, ma'am.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.234
Sgt. Dan:
There's definitely no excuses.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.694
Training officer: All your
classmates have a towel!

33:47.777 --> 33:48.903
Where's your towel at?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.197
Answer me, recruit,
answer me!

33:51.281 --> 33:53.033
Nora: Sir, should be
at home, sir.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.453
Training officer:
Why is your shit not put away?!

33:56.494 --> 33:59.039
Put it away!
Clean this place up!

33:59.122 --> 34:01.499
Sgt. Dan: Pick up your stuff!
Pick up your stuff!

34:01.833 --> 34:03.710
Training officer:
If it ain't yours, just grab it.

34:03.793 --> 34:06.087
Sort it out later. Let's go!

34:06.171 --> 34:08.130
Sgt. Williams:
Not fast enough!

34:08.172 --> 34:11.176
Too much time!
Dump them out.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.179
Dump 'em!
Dump your bags!

34:16.348 --> 34:20.060
Sgt. Dan: So day one,
working on the mindset.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.853
I mean, being here at
the academy is kind of like...

34:22.896 --> 34:24.022
There's like mind games.

34:24.105 --> 34:25.982
Sgt. Williams:
Dump the bag!

34:26.024 --> 34:27.317
You took too long!

34:27.692 --> 34:29.860
Sgt. Dan:
They're gonna be in trouble
no matter what they do.

34:29.944 --> 34:31.029
Even if they do it right.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.237
Sgt. Williams:
Were you told you could put

34:32.322 --> 34:33.531
anything in the barracks?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.866
Recruit: I didn't put it
in the barracks, sir.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.661
Sgt. Williams: I don't want
to hear your excuses!

34:38.703 --> 34:40.080
As a police officer,
you have to be able

34:40.163 --> 34:41.373
to roll with the punches.

34:41.414 --> 34:42.706
That's a huge
part of the job.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.502
Nothing ever goes the way
you think it's going to go.

34:45.543 --> 34:48.129
Now give me this!
Let me help you again!

34:48.338 --> 34:50.882
We're applying pressure,
we're applying stress.

34:50.924 --> 34:52.050
Let's go!

34:52.132 --> 34:53.717
Sgt. Williams:
Because we have to develop

34:53.760 --> 34:54.886
those neural pathways.

34:55.387 --> 34:57.639
Here's what it's like
to have somebody in your face.

34:57.681 --> 34:59.265
(training officer screaming)

34:59.349 --> 35:03.019
They can't experience that
for the first time in the field.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.730
We teach what we teach
for a reason.

35:06.064 --> 35:08.233
Training officer:
I need somebody to come

35:08.274 --> 35:10.694
and save my ass
when I get into shit.

35:11.236 --> 35:14.572
I need someone
who can listen,

35:14.656 --> 35:15.907
pay attention,

35:16.116 --> 35:18.493
and know when I need help!

35:18.576 --> 35:21.079
If you guys
can't follow directions,

35:21.162 --> 35:22.414
you shouldn't be here!

35:22.747 --> 35:24.749
Get in line! Get in line!
Get in sync!

35:24.791 --> 35:26.126
Training officer:
Get your feet up, let's go!

35:26.209 --> 35:28.086
Sgt. Dan:
Are you freaking tired already?

35:28.169 --> 35:30.255
We've barely started!

35:33.258 --> 35:36.428
(wind whistling)

35:36.511 --> 35:39.264
(flies buzzing)

35:42.809 --> 35:43.935
(clears throat)

35:47.397 --> 35:49.190
Shawvan:
How's everyone feeling?

35:49.899 --> 35:51.109
(indistinct chatter)

35:51.192 --> 35:53.153
-Cheyenne: My hip hurts.
-Recruit: Good, sir.

35:53.820 --> 35:56.364
Shawvan: We just got
to take care of ourselves.

35:57.657 --> 35:58.950
But keep working hard.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.994
(door opens)

36:01.077 --> 36:03.371
Class, attention!

36:06.291 --> 36:07.709
Sgt. Dan:
You guys tired?

36:08.168 --> 36:09.794
Class:
Ma'am, no, ma'am.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.757
Sgt. Dan: We're gonna do
a little team building,

36:13.798 --> 36:16.176
working together

36:16.259 --> 36:19.763
on how to get this task done
that we've given you.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.015
You will have
to help each other.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.476
My maternal grandpa was
a medicine man,

36:24.517 --> 36:27.979
and he took a lot of time
helping people.

36:29.731 --> 36:32.776
My mom, my father,
they did the same thing.

36:32.817 --> 36:37.072
So I think it's more
of a calling for me,

36:37.155 --> 36:40.033
like I was led into it.

36:40.325 --> 36:43.745
I'm guided by spirits
to come into this field.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.163
Class:
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

36:45.372 --> 36:48.166
Sgt. Dan: See all my family
right here in brown?

36:48.208 --> 36:49.793
They're my family.

36:49.834 --> 36:51.169
Just like you guys will be

36:51.252 --> 36:54.339
and will have to be
by the time we are done.

36:54.422 --> 36:56.549
There's that connection.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.009
There's a bond,

36:58.301 --> 37:01.554
and I tend to get emotional

37:01.638 --> 37:06.726
because it's, it's just
deep inside me, I guess.

37:07.936 --> 37:10.146
Squad one, run in there.

37:10.188 --> 37:11.690
Training officer:
Grab your water.

37:15.819 --> 37:17.654
Training officer: (indistinct)
get him up here!

37:17.696 --> 37:18.988
Training officer 2:
Get him up there.

37:19.698 --> 37:21.074
Sgt. Williams:
So it took them six minutes

37:21.157 --> 37:22.534
-to get up that side...
-Yeah.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.202
-...and it took the last class
six minutes

37:24.244 --> 37:25.787
to complete
the whole thing, right?

37:25.870 --> 37:26.538
Sgt. Dan:
Yeah.

37:26.621 --> 37:28.164
Sgt. Williams:
For fuck sake.

37:28.707 --> 37:31.126
It's our mission
to prepare a civilian

37:31.209 --> 37:32.669
to work in the field.

37:33.128 --> 37:35.422
So folks come in real soft.

37:35.505 --> 37:36.631
Training officer:
Get them up there!

37:36.715 --> 37:38.466
Sgt. Williams:
Some folks who are just sedate,

37:38.550 --> 37:40.218
they're not athletic.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.262
Training officer:
That got nowhere quick, huh?

37:42.762 --> 37:45.265
(sighs) Some, I'd say
horribly out of shape.

37:45.348 --> 37:48.268
We get some chunky folks
coming through here.

37:48.351 --> 37:49.811
(Deshane panting)

37:49.894 --> 37:51.438
Sgt. Williams: The structured
physical training,

37:51.521 --> 37:54.190
sometimes that's a shock
for you,

37:54.232 --> 37:56.860
and it comes day after day,
every day.

37:56.901 --> 37:58.069
(Deshane groans)

37:58.278 --> 37:59.237
Sgt. Williams:
It's not easy

37:59.320 --> 38:00.739
so if you're
a person looking

38:00.780 --> 38:03.158
for easy work,
this isn't where you want to be.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.869
Lt. Kee:
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.621
Quit thinking about
how your body hurts.

38:08.913 --> 38:11.458
Quit thinking about
how tired you are.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.376
It can't go on forever, can it?

38:13.418 --> 38:14.878
Class:
Sir, no, sir.

38:14.961 --> 38:16.755
How do we eat
a shit sandwich?

38:17.422 --> 38:19.090
Class:
Sir, one bite at a time, sir.

38:19.174 --> 38:20.717
One bite at a time.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.429
Your success at the academy

38:24.888 --> 38:26.431
will be directly related

38:26.765 --> 38:28.975
to the amount of work
you put in

38:29.351 --> 38:32.187
with the effort
in which you apply.

38:32.270 --> 38:34.397
If you don't have
a sense of purpose,

38:34.689 --> 38:36.274
you will not be here long.

38:36.524 --> 38:38.443
Sgt. Williams: You know,
you can't tell a person's heart

38:38.526 --> 38:39.778
by looking on the outside.

38:39.819 --> 38:41.905
Sgt. Dan: You got it.
Don't give up, Pettigrew.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.699
Sgt. Williams: And if you get
some person in here like,

38:44.783 --> 38:45.867
"Oh, pff, they're gonna--
You know,

38:45.909 --> 38:46.826
they're not gonna make it,"

38:46.910 --> 38:49.037
but it turns out
they've got a lot of heart.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.121
Sgt. Dan:
There you go!

38:50.163 --> 38:51.289
Recruit:
Go!

38:51.623 --> 38:52.457
Sgt. Dan:
You got it.

38:52.540 --> 38:53.500
(indistinct shouting)

38:53.583 --> 38:55.377
Sgt. Dan:
Go, go, go, go, run!

38:55.460 --> 38:57.003
Sgt. Williams:
If they have the heart for it,

38:57.087 --> 38:58.129
we'll show them the road.

38:58.505 --> 39:00.340
They just have
to run down it.

39:05.178 --> 39:06.638
(recruit groans)

39:08.348 --> 39:09.891
Recruit:
Damn, my legs are killing me.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.812
Shawvan: I think it's when
everybody looks at me

39:13.895 --> 39:15.814
like I lied to them.

39:16.606 --> 39:17.816
William:
You do lie to us.

39:18.108 --> 39:20.276
Shawvan: "You said this wasn't
going to happen."

39:20.318 --> 39:21.194
Mm-hmm.

39:21.277 --> 39:22.654
(laughter)

39:22.737 --> 39:25.156
Everything's different
from last class,

39:25.907 --> 39:26.783
but it's fun.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.993
I mean, it's definitely
something new

39:29.035 --> 39:30.161
and builds us,

39:30.203 --> 39:32.122
brings us in together
more as a team.

39:32.539 --> 39:33.957
William:
Just got to keep pushing.

39:34.165 --> 39:35.500
We'll be alright.

39:36.835 --> 39:38.670
I don't think no one's gonna
quit, bro.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.008
Shawvan:
Good job today, you guys.

39:53.518 --> 39:55.520
Lt. Kee:
Congratulations.

39:55.562 --> 39:57.522
Day one is in the books.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.442
You think we're all done
with the quitters?

40:00.525 --> 40:02.027
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.863
This is only the beginning.

40:05.530 --> 40:08.033
Sgt. Williams:
Do not become complacent.

40:08.408 --> 40:11.619
Our brothers and sisters
are in desperate need

40:11.703 --> 40:14.622
of assistance
to serve the people.

40:15.373 --> 40:19.711
Every day they have to wait
for more help

40:20.253 --> 40:23.048
is a day
they are in more danger.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.760
You are the help
that's coming.

40:30.388 --> 40:34.059

40:45.737 --> 40:47.655
Sgt. Eldon Foster:
The last couple months
has been picking up.

40:47.739 --> 40:52.911
We've been seeing a lot
of new crimes left and right.

40:52.994 --> 40:56.414
The only thing that we can do
is prepare for that danger.

40:56.456 --> 40:57.916
(Dispatch speaking over radio)

41:10.470 --> 41:11.805
Sgt. Foster:
Ah, geez.

41:12.722 --> 41:13.515
Hello?

41:13.765 --> 41:15.433
Hey, um,
is this the same dude?

41:15.475 --> 41:16.434
Remember the one
that got stabbed

41:16.476 --> 41:18.520
by, um, the guy
across the street

41:18.603 --> 41:20.522
when that firearm
was deployed on us?

41:20.605 --> 41:22.107
It's the same one, right?

41:24.109 --> 41:25.902
I'm gonna hang up now because
I'm gonna put my phone here.

41:25.944 --> 41:27.737
This guy's probably gonna
fight with us.

41:31.241 --> 41:33.785
(dogs barking)

41:34.285 --> 41:35.537
They see us.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.163
(banging on door)

41:37.247 --> 41:39.916
Navajo Police. Keep knocking.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.543
I'll get the (indistinct)

41:42.627 --> 41:44.796
14-year-old JV
that's inside the back.

41:44.879 --> 41:46.589
She's calling. She's crying.

41:46.631 --> 41:49.217
When I went to the door
I just heard, "Oh, shit."

41:51.386 --> 41:53.138
Can you ask
if she hears our knock?

41:53.179 --> 41:54.431
We're knocking on the house.

41:54.472 --> 41:56.474
You want to confirm
this is the right house?

41:56.558 --> 41:58.268
-Dispatch: (indistinct)
-(banging on door)

41:58.768 --> 42:00.979
Dispatch: She heard you.
She's whispering at this time.

42:01.021 --> 42:03.523
She's scared
to get out of the shower.

42:03.606 --> 42:05.108
Sgt. Foster:
Mm-hmm.

42:05.150 --> 42:06.234
What do you think?

42:09.362 --> 42:11.322
-Sgt. Foster: Yeah...
-(door creaks)

42:16.119 --> 42:16.953
Officer:
What's going on?

42:16.995 --> 42:18.288
(girl crying)

42:18.663 --> 42:20.165
Girl:
I'm scared.

42:20.206 --> 42:21.291
Sgt. Foster:
Okay.

42:31.009 --> 42:32.344
Sgt. Foster:
Is there anybody else inside

42:32.385 --> 42:33.970
that might be,
that might be hurt?

42:35.013 --> 42:36.181
Sgt. Foster:
Okay. He's still inside?

42:38.516 --> 42:39.517
Sgt. Foster:
Ta-ta-take her that way,

42:39.601 --> 42:40.852
get her secured.

42:42.312 --> 42:44.189
Go ahead and kick the door.
I'll follow you in.

42:44.230 --> 42:45.273
Officer:
Okay.

42:46.608 --> 42:50.111
(thudding)

42:55.075 --> 42:56.659
Go, go, go, go, go.

42:56.701 --> 42:57.786
Navajo police, man.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.162
-Man: Dude.
-Sgt. Foster:
All the way down, man.

42:59.204 --> 43:00.538
-Man: Okay.
-Sgt. Foster: All the way down.

43:00.580 --> 43:01.623
-Put your hands behind--
-Man: What the hell?

43:01.706 --> 43:02.624
Put your hands
behind your back.

43:02.707 --> 43:03.708
Man:
Okay.

43:03.792 --> 43:05.585
I don't know
what the hell's going on.

43:07.837 --> 43:08.755
Officer:
Keep going that way.

43:08.838 --> 43:10.048
Man:
I know, I know.

43:14.010 --> 43:15.261
Sgt. Foster:
Are you okay?

43:16.054 --> 43:17.013
Are you okay?

43:17.055 --> 43:19.933
Okay. Alright.
You're safe now, okay?

43:20.016 --> 43:20.975
Boy:
Okay.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.311
Sgt. Foster:
No, no, no, no, no.

43:23.395 --> 43:25.230
Where's grandma and grandpa?

43:25.313 --> 43:26.690
Get some shoes on, okay?

43:26.731 --> 43:28.108
I'm gonna go check.
Anybody else in here?

43:28.191 --> 43:30.026
-Boy: It's only me.
-Sgt. Foster: Huh?

43:30.944 --> 43:32.696
Sgt. Foster: Nowhere. We're just
gonna find somebody that--

43:32.737 --> 43:34.739
somebody, uh,
a parent for you, okay?

43:44.290 --> 43:45.709
Not a good sight to see.

43:46.751 --> 43:48.003
(Dispatch speaking)

43:51.840 --> 43:53.591
Sgt. Foster:
Oof. Fucking A.

43:54.092 --> 43:55.677
So these past few Sundays
have been

43:55.760 --> 43:57.387
really, really, really busy.

43:58.138 --> 44:01.349
So I'm expecting today's
gonna be the same,

44:01.433 --> 44:03.852
and tonight is only us three.

44:05.228 --> 44:08.106
Eugenia:
Crime is high.

44:08.148 --> 44:09.065
It scares me.

44:09.399 --> 44:13.695
It scares me because, uh,
we had our house broken into,

44:13.778 --> 44:15.405
and we've heard of a couple,

44:15.488 --> 44:17.115
you know,
their home was burglarized,

44:17.157 --> 44:18.616
who were tied up,

44:18.700 --> 44:20.952
um, and they were tied up
for three days,

44:20.994 --> 44:24.456
and those are the scary stories
that keep us up at night.

44:24.497 --> 44:25.707
But they're also
the scary stories

44:25.790 --> 44:27.959
that make us want to leave.

44:29.294 --> 44:30.962
There are a lot of people

44:31.004 --> 44:34.007
who leave the reservation
that don't return,

44:34.382 --> 44:37.844
and businesses don't want
to come onto the Nation

44:37.927 --> 44:39.512
because it's not safe.

44:39.971 --> 44:42.140
That means less
and less jobs here,

44:42.182 --> 44:44.976
which means more people
are gonna leave

44:45.018 --> 44:48.021
and that just, like, just...
(sighs heavily)

44:48.104 --> 44:49.481
It-it, um...

44:50.815 --> 44:52.359
makes you feel sick.

44:56.905 --> 45:02.118
(Native American chanting)

45:11.336 --> 45:13.380
Lt. Kee: It's difficult being
a law enforcement officer

45:13.463 --> 45:14.923
on the Navajo Nation.

45:15.006 --> 45:18.009
You see a lot of things
that are not in line

45:18.093 --> 45:20.762
with some
traditional Navajo beliefs

45:20.845 --> 45:24.516
as it pertains to harmony
and balance.

45:24.599 --> 45:27.519
You see a lot
of unbalanced people

45:27.602 --> 45:29.270
living unbalanced lives.

45:29.688 --> 45:31.690
I don't know that there are
a whole lot

45:31.731 --> 45:35.985
of truly traditional
Navajo people anymore.

45:36.277 --> 45:39.197
So I can't say
that I'm truly traditional,

45:39.280 --> 45:42.575
but my own experience
primarily is off-reservation.

45:42.659 --> 45:45.620
I got finished growing up
in the Marine Corps. That was...

45:46.287 --> 45:49.666
Marine Corps had a huge,
a huge impact on my life.

45:49.708 --> 45:50.917
Gave me, gave me
a lot of good things,

45:51.001 --> 45:52.168
gave me a lot of bad things,

45:52.210 --> 45:53.878
but gave me
a lot of good things.

45:54.629 --> 45:56.965
But, uh, because I was
Native American,

45:57.424 --> 45:59.259
my, uh,
my team leader was like,

45:59.342 --> 46:01.386
"You're gonna run point
because you're Navajo."

46:01.428 --> 46:04.264
(laughs)

46:06.099 --> 46:08.393
I guess he just assumed
that I had skills.

46:11.521 --> 46:16.359
Platoon, at close interval,
dress right, dress!

46:16.985 --> 46:19.446
Navajos have
a longstanding history

46:19.529 --> 46:21.197
of military service.

46:21.239 --> 46:23.074
A-ten-hut!

46:23.491 --> 46:26.828
Big part of that is the lack
of immediate opportunity

46:26.911 --> 46:28.997
for employment here on Navajo.

46:29.247 --> 46:30.957
You know,
I went on my first deployment

46:31.041 --> 46:33.585
and I, I saw combat
my first deployment,

46:33.668 --> 46:35.337
uh, 19 years old.

46:36.046 --> 46:38.715
-Your boots need some work.
-Shawvan: Sir, yes, sir.

46:38.757 --> 46:40.008
Lt. Kee:
I do things to this day

46:40.091 --> 46:41.509
that the Marine Corps
taught me.

46:41.593 --> 46:42.427
Your jacket...

46:42.510 --> 46:43.720
The way that I shine my boots,

46:43.762 --> 46:45.096
the way that I shave
my face.

46:45.180 --> 46:46.765
When did you start shaving?

46:46.806 --> 46:48.266
Uh, last night, sir.

46:49.476 --> 46:51.895
When was the first time
that you ever shaved your face?

46:51.936 --> 46:54.022
Uh, sir, Sunday morning, sir.

46:54.105 --> 46:55.523
Lt. Kee:
That was the very first time?

46:56.107 --> 46:57.942
-Sir, no, sir.
-In your life.

46:58.026 --> 47:00.987
When was the first time
you ever shaved your face?

47:01.071 --> 47:02.113
Shawvan:
Sir, sophomore year, sir.

47:02.197 --> 47:03.948
Okay. You need
to hit your upper lip.

47:03.990 --> 47:07.077
What the military offered
for me was a plan.

47:07.118 --> 47:08.495
Let me see
your fingernails.

47:08.912 --> 47:14.084
I was not probably on
the best path as a teenager.

47:14.125 --> 47:15.251
You got to cut your nails.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.962
If the Marine Corps
hadn't been there for me,

47:18.004 --> 47:20.423
I very easily could
have gone either way.

47:20.465 --> 47:21.216
Go shave.

47:21.299 --> 47:22.634
I very easily
could have been

47:23.093 --> 47:26.054
one of the guys
that I frequently arrested.

47:28.098 --> 47:29.974
Officer:
This last whole year,

47:30.016 --> 47:33.311
we've done
32 recruit drives.

47:33.395 --> 47:36.606
That's still one of our goals
is to start a huge class.

47:36.690 --> 47:41.277
This class we had
over 250 applicants

47:41.319 --> 47:45.824
that came in and of course
it narrowed down to 28.

47:45.865 --> 47:47.075
So but we're still...

47:47.158 --> 47:48.868
Ronald: One of the issues
that's plaguing us

47:48.952 --> 47:50.203
with recruitment is that

47:50.286 --> 47:53.039
everybody's passing
the physical fitness standards.

47:53.123 --> 47:55.667
They're passing the tests,
the entrance exam,

47:55.709 --> 47:58.670
but when we actually do
the background,

47:58.712 --> 47:59.921
half of them are disqualified,

48:00.005 --> 48:02.590
or mostly all of them
are disqualified.

48:03.091 --> 48:05.010
Officer: We were working
on one background.

48:05.093 --> 48:07.012
Young guy.
He's young, 24 years old.

48:07.345 --> 48:09.681
and long and behold,
the individual had

48:09.764 --> 48:12.475
a active warrant
out of Bernalillo County.

48:12.767 --> 48:15.395
Ronald: A lot of our youngsters
have already established

48:15.478 --> 48:16.688
a record for themselves.

48:16.730 --> 48:18.523
To become a police officer,

48:18.565 --> 48:22.318
your background literally
goes back to high school days.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.030
So we have
to target the kids

48:25.071 --> 48:27.032
at a very young age
to keep them out of trouble

48:27.073 --> 48:28.491
as much as we can.

48:28.867 --> 48:31.202
Sgt. Williams:
Watch what you do.

48:31.870 --> 48:33.621
If you've done something

48:34.247 --> 48:36.249
since you entered
the background process,

48:36.332 --> 48:39.627
you need to let us know
immediately.

48:40.211 --> 48:41.755
Use your heads.
We can't help you

48:41.838 --> 48:43.548
if you're not honest
with us, can we?

48:43.590 --> 48:44.924
Class:
Sir, no, sir.

48:45.008 --> 48:47.010
Sgt. Williams: And what's
the best way to not have

48:47.052 --> 48:48.178
to worry about any of this?

48:48.219 --> 48:49.220
Recruit:
Don't do it, sir.

48:49.304 --> 48:50.805
Don't--
Yeah, there you go.

48:50.889 --> 48:52.265
Don't fuckin' do it.

48:52.974 --> 48:55.393
These things always come
to the surface.

48:59.022 --> 49:01.149
(phone ringing)

49:03.902 --> 49:05.320
Dispatch:
Shiprock Police Department.

49:07.113 --> 49:09.199
Uh, what kind
of weapon did you see?

49:12.160 --> 49:14.079
And who is this individual?

49:14.329 --> 49:16.623
-Sgt. Foster: 230.
-Paramedic: He's bleeding a lot.
He's all pale.

49:16.706 --> 49:20.043
He about ready to go into shock
and the family members,

49:20.085 --> 49:22.671
that lady that's with him,
hinders him from going.

49:23.088 --> 49:25.340
And if we have to arrest him,
bring him in,

49:25.423 --> 49:26.925
else he's gonna die
if he doesn't... (indistinct).

49:26.966 --> 49:28.385
Sgt. Foster: Okay, well,
i-if he's gonna,

49:28.426 --> 49:30.220
if he's gonna die and that's,
that's what you guys observe...

49:30.261 --> 49:32.222
- Yeah.
-...we're gonna, we're gonna
get him out regardless.

49:32.263 --> 49:33.223
Yeah.

49:34.516 --> 49:36.643
-Man: Who's there?
-Sgt. Foster: Navajo Police.

49:39.437 --> 49:40.980
Sgt. Foster:
You're talking to me.

49:41.648 --> 49:42.899
Man:
Nobody's home.

49:42.941 --> 49:44.734
Sgt. Foster:
Navajo police, open the door.

49:44.776 --> 49:46.778
We want to check
on the individual
that's been stabbed in there.

49:46.861 --> 49:47.904
Where's he at?

49:48.154 --> 49:49.280
(man speaking indistinctly)

49:49.322 --> 49:50.990
Okay, we got
to go check on him, okay?

49:51.074 --> 49:51.950
-Man: Okay.
-Sgt. Foster: Excuse me.

49:51.991 --> 49:52.909
Man:
Stand by. He's better.

49:52.951 --> 49:53.785
Okay, we're going in there.

49:53.868 --> 49:55.120
Excuse me.

49:56.121 --> 49:57.288
(indistinct chatter)

49:57.330 --> 49:58.707
Sgt. Foster:
Come on out, man.

50:00.125 --> 50:02.127
-Come on out, man.
-(woman speaking indistinctly)

50:02.460 --> 50:04.504
Sgt. Foster: I want to make sure
that you're okay, bro.

50:04.963 --> 50:06.756
Oh, sheez,
you got stabbed, dude.

50:08.550 --> 50:10.218
We got to take you
to the hospital, man.

50:10.301 --> 50:11.970
(man speaking indistinctly)

50:12.303 --> 50:14.597
Sgt. Foster:
Uh, they won't let her go
if she's intoxicated.

50:16.599 --> 50:17.475
Man:
I'm okay.

50:17.517 --> 50:18.893
Sgt. Foster:
You got to go, man.

50:18.935 --> 50:20.228
It's-- You're--
You have no choice right now.

50:20.311 --> 50:21.646
You're gonna have to go.

50:21.688 --> 50:24.357
-(man speaking indistinctly)
-Lt. Kee: Get the EMT in.

50:24.441 --> 50:25.567
I don't know if he saw
their bedroom,

50:25.650 --> 50:27.110
but there was like
a huge amount of blood

50:27.152 --> 50:28.528
inside that bedroom.

50:29.404 --> 50:31.072
(phone ringing)

50:31.614 --> 50:33.366
Dispatch:
Shiprock Police Department.

50:35.410 --> 50:37.203
Okay, ma'am, I'll let
my officers know.

50:37.287 --> 50:39.039
Uh, right now, they're out
on calls right now,

50:39.122 --> 50:40.457
so it's gonna be a while.

50:42.375 --> 50:44.044
(Dispatch speaking on radio)

50:52.260 --> 50:53.386
Sgt. Foster:
Uh, LT, sir,

50:53.470 --> 50:55.138
with your permission,
is it, is it okay

50:55.180 --> 50:57.182
if I just pull Terrance
from the casino?

50:57.766 --> 51:00.685
We are just getting hammered,
man, with a lot of calls.

51:07.442 --> 51:08.568
Geez.

51:10.278 --> 51:11.780
Shiprock, 235 Adam.

51:12.030 --> 51:14.532
(phones ringing)

51:14.574 --> 51:15.867
Officer (over radio):
235 Adam.

51:18.870 --> 51:20.997
Narrator (on training video):
The transitions are slower.

51:21.039 --> 51:22.791
You got to bring
a lot more patience,

51:22.874 --> 51:24.459
a lot more focus
to that breath.

51:24.709 --> 51:26.878
But welcome.
This is definitely gonna be

51:26.920 --> 51:28.755
one potent experience today.

51:28.838 --> 51:31.800
With that, I want you
to start in a position

51:31.883 --> 51:33.468
that we call Dragon Pose.

51:33.968 --> 51:35.345
So we're gonna come down
to our hands

51:35.387 --> 51:36.888
and our knees,
if not already.

51:36.930 --> 51:38.848
We're gonna step our
right foot in between our...

51:38.890 --> 51:40.350
Sgt. Williams:
Hello.

51:40.725 --> 51:42.560
Go ahead. What can I--

51:45.772 --> 51:46.856
Oh, shit.

51:49.109 --> 51:50.694
Okay, Sloan?

51:51.319 --> 51:52.696
He's the suspect?

51:53.238 --> 51:56.533
He's the suspect
in a criminal damage incident?

51:56.616 --> 51:58.284
When did that happen?

51:59.244 --> 52:00.745
Is he under subpoena?

52:01.746 --> 52:02.706
Shit.

52:03.081 --> 52:05.083
I want a copy
of the subpoena,

52:05.166 --> 52:08.086
send a photo of it,
just anything that lets me know.

52:08.670 --> 52:10.880
Let me go talk to him,
find out if he was arrested,

52:10.922 --> 52:13.049
'cause he didn't declare
any arrests

52:13.091 --> 52:15.301
on his background paperwork.

52:16.261 --> 52:20.890
Sloan. Too Tall.
Where's Sloan?

52:20.932 --> 52:23.268
Over here. You're on me.

52:25.478 --> 52:27.772
So what is going on
with this court case?

52:27.814 --> 52:29.941
It's my understanding
you're under subpoena.

52:30.150 --> 52:31.943
-William: Yeah.
-Sgt. Williams: Yeah?

52:32.027 --> 52:33.528
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

52:33.820 --> 52:36.656
-William: Sir, yes, sir.
-Sgt. Williams: Okay, so tell me
about the subpoena.

52:40.535 --> 52:42.328
Sgt. Williams:
Just like a couple weeks ago?

52:42.412 --> 52:43.455
William:
Sir, yes, sir.

52:43.872 --> 52:47.584
Why did you not disclose this
to background or academy staff?

52:48.168 --> 52:49.836
William:
Sir, I'm not too sure, sir.

52:51.212 --> 52:53.381
Yeah, you're done. Take him back
over to the kitchen.

52:53.590 --> 52:55.008
Training officer:
I'll process him?

52:55.091 --> 52:56.134
Sgt. Williams:
Let me call the commander.

52:56.217 --> 52:57.761
Stand by on it.
Keep an eye on him.

52:57.844 --> 52:58.970
Training officer:
Let's go.

53:01.681 --> 53:04.809
Sgt. Williams:
Yeah. So let me, uh...

53:06.770 --> 53:08.730
Sgt. Williams:
Yeah. Yep.

53:10.106 --> 53:12.400
Um, I guess I need
a little guidance here.

53:12.484 --> 53:13.485
This isn't a resignation.

53:13.568 --> 53:14.986
This is a y-you're fucking done,

53:15.028 --> 53:17.322
untruthfulness.

53:17.405 --> 53:19.741
What, uh, what's--
What are we looking at?

53:20.825 --> 53:22.243
(in Navajo)

53:23.661 --> 53:25.246
Training officer:
You know the seriousness

53:25.330 --> 53:26.247
of this, correct?

53:26.331 --> 53:27.582
William:
Sir, yes, sir.

53:28.458 --> 53:30.960
Training officer: You were told
to disclose everything.

53:32.545 --> 53:34.506
Sgt. Williams: So I talked
to Lieutenant, he's gone.

53:34.547 --> 53:36.466
I mean, this is a termination,

53:36.508 --> 53:40.720
and he won't be eligible
for rehire, so...

53:42.681 --> 53:44.265
Goddamn.

53:49.521 --> 53:51.690
Page PD got sent over
to his house.

53:51.731 --> 53:53.692
The wife called him
in intoxicated,

53:53.775 --> 53:56.695
didn't want him to drive,
and he picked up a rock,

53:56.778 --> 53:58.822
and he put it through
a window on a vehicle,

53:58.863 --> 54:01.616
and it turned out to be
his mother-in-law's vehicle.

54:02.909 --> 54:04.703
(Lt. Kee speaking over phone)

54:05.537 --> 54:07.539
Sgt. Williams: Well, I had to do
the last one. That sucked.

54:07.580 --> 54:10.166
Well, you did
the last one, so...

54:10.208 --> 54:11.876
But...

54:11.960 --> 54:13.086
You good to do it?

54:13.545 --> 54:14.921
-Sgt. Dan: Mm-hmm.
-Sgt. Williams: Alright.

54:15.005 --> 54:16.214
I don't have the heart.

54:16.548 --> 54:18.341
We'll get it done and we'll
let you know when it's finished.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.093
-Lt. Kee: Okay. Thank you.
-Alright, sir.

54:20.176 --> 54:21.386
-Bye.
-Lt. Kee: Bye.

54:23.179 --> 54:24.305
(in Navajo)

54:25.140 --> 54:26.641
-Mm-hmm.
-Sgt. Williams: Okay.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.229
(sighs)

54:31.271 --> 54:32.564
(Director speaking)

54:34.816 --> 54:35.859
Sgt. Dan:
I'm mad.

54:37.652 --> 54:41.489
He has potential
to be, you know,

54:41.948 --> 54:42.907
one of us.

54:43.241 --> 54:45.201
Dispatch (over radio): All units
trying to get coordinates

54:45.243 --> 54:46.536
to the 10-7.

54:46.578 --> 54:48.580
Sgt. Foster: To another 10-7,
is that what you said?

54:48.788 --> 54:51.750
(sighs) I-I just pulled Terrance
from the casino, man.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.793
I had to. I already--

54:53.877 --> 54:55.420
This is, this is not good.

54:55.462 --> 54:57.589
So I already made the call.

54:59.382 --> 55:01.092
Sergeant Foster,
Navajo Nation Police.

55:01.176 --> 55:02.302
Can you tell me
what pills you took?

55:02.385 --> 55:03.803
Is it this bottle
right here?

55:06.723 --> 55:08.183
Sgt. Foster: What made you want
to take pills today?

55:08.266 --> 55:09.434
Can you talk to me?

55:09.601 --> 55:12.520
Stay awake, okay?
Stay awake.

55:12.604 --> 55:15.065
Sgt. Dan: It's just hard
getting more people,

55:15.106 --> 55:17.984
more officers
out there to help.

55:18.401 --> 55:20.945
This memorandum serves
as official notification

55:21.029 --> 55:23.615
that you are hereby terminated
from your position

55:23.698 --> 55:27.494
as a police recruit
effective immediately.

55:28.828 --> 55:30.705
If we don't get people
out there,

55:30.789 --> 55:32.957
we're just gonna
be reducing in numbers.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.335
Sgt. Foster:
Update, female on this end

55:35.418 --> 55:37.796
is going in and out
of consciousness,

55:37.837 --> 55:40.298
trying to find the bottle
that she consumed.

55:40.382 --> 55:42.842
Dispatch: (indistinct)
have a elderly 101 10-7...

55:44.260 --> 55:45.887
-Okay.
-Officer: Lithium.

55:45.929 --> 55:46.846
-Lithium?
-Officer: Yeah.

55:46.930 --> 55:48.473
Okay, okay.

55:48.515 --> 55:49.641
(Dispatch continues)

55:49.683 --> 55:50.934
Sgt. Foster:
I'm sorry. I apologize.

55:50.975 --> 55:51.976
Can you repeat that please?

55:56.898 --> 55:59.651
Daryl: We are short-staffed
to a point

55:59.693 --> 56:02.904
that we cannot
effectively police.

56:02.946 --> 56:04.030
Sgt. Foster:
Oh, my gosh.

56:04.406 --> 56:05.824
There's no way
that we can do it safely.

56:05.907 --> 56:08.535
Officer:
Don't reach anything.
Don't touch anything.

56:08.618 --> 56:10.578
Come to the back.
Don't touch nothing!

56:10.662 --> 56:13.373
I said come to the back.

56:15.500 --> 56:18.420
Daryl: I go home at night
and I worry

56:18.503 --> 56:20.005
every time my phone rings.

56:20.922 --> 56:22.298
Sgt. Foster: Don't call out
to me like that, man.

56:22.632 --> 56:24.300
Don't call out to me
like that, man.

56:24.676 --> 56:26.594
You do not call out
to me like that, man.

56:27.387 --> 56:28.430
Man:
Fuck you.

56:28.847 --> 56:30.557
Sgt. Williams:
You have what's classified

56:30.640 --> 56:31.933
as a felony arrest.

56:32.017 --> 56:35.228
You really think
that it will be wise for us

56:35.311 --> 56:37.022
to keep you here
with that on your record?

56:37.397 --> 56:38.523
William:
Sir, no, sir.

56:38.732 --> 56:41.943
Sgt. Williams: So,
a door's closing for you today.

56:42.777 --> 56:45.363
So I don't know if you're
a spiritual man or not,

56:45.447 --> 56:48.324
but you're not
on this path anymore

56:48.366 --> 56:49.617
and there's a reason for it.

56:49.951 --> 56:53.329
There might have been death
waiting on this path for you.

56:53.371 --> 56:55.790
(suspect yelling)

56:56.416 --> 56:58.543
Daryl:
We're not getting ahead.

56:58.585 --> 57:01.421
And my fear is
we're not gonna be able.

57:01.796 --> 57:03.923
Ma'am, ma'am, hold on.
Hold on.

57:04.341 --> 57:05.467
Ma'am, you don't need
to scream.

57:05.550 --> 57:07.010
What's your name
and phone number?

57:07.552 --> 57:08.970
Eugenia:
This is our Nation.

57:09.471 --> 57:12.098
It's been our land
from time immemorial.

57:12.182 --> 57:15.560
We've always been within
the four sacred mountains.

57:16.227 --> 57:19.356
And if the people keep leaving,
it's a scary thought,

57:19.397 --> 57:22.150
but there would be really
no reason

57:22.233 --> 57:24.569
to have this Nation.

57:26.946 --> 57:30.742
And because everything
is tied to public safety
and justice,

57:30.825 --> 57:35.413
the success of
the Navajo Police Academy

57:35.497 --> 57:38.124
could break
or make the Nation.

57:49.010 --> 57:52.722
