WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.336
Hi, Galina, hey Tatiana.

00:03.338 --> 00:05.038
Hey, Yevgenya. Hey.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.373
I love your braids. Thank you.

00:06.375 --> 00:07.474
Here to wax the usual spots?

00:07.476 --> 00:11.678
Yep, you know it.
Okay, follow me.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.480
Been a long time.

00:13.482 --> 00:14.314
Like a week.

00:14.316 --> 00:18.585
No, it's been,
like, three weeks.

00:18.587 --> 00:20.921
I'm sorry.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.290
Okay, this may hurt.

00:23.292 --> 00:25.425
My body's learned.

00:25.427 --> 00:29.329
Oh... kay.

00:29.331 --> 00:31.064
Whoa.

00:31.066 --> 00:32.598
Oh, my God.

00:32.601 --> 00:33.767
First voice message.

00:33.769 --> 00:35.769
Abbi, this one is a great idea.

00:35.771 --> 00:38.405
What about an umbrella, but
it's connected to your clothes,

00:38.407 --> 00:39.773
so you don't have to hold it?

00:39.775 --> 00:40.707
That'd be hot.

00:40.709 --> 00:41.608
Maybe draw it up?

00:41.610 --> 00:45.212
Abbi, there is a hot couch on
the corner of 4th and Avenue C.

00:45.214 --> 00:47.380
Do you need a couch?
I'm e-mailing you pics.

00:47.382 --> 00:49.783
Hey, girl, there's, like,
piss and blood on it.

00:49.785 --> 00:51.518
Okay, sorry to bother you, bye!

00:51.520 --> 00:53.620
Abbi, Jaime's
coworker has a turtle

00:53.622 --> 00:54.654
and it just had baby turtles.

00:54.656 --> 00:56.123
I thought maybe we
could each get one.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.625
So text me back if
you don't want a turtle.

00:58.627 --> 01:00.828
Hey, Ab, never mind about
that umbrella idea.

01:00.829 --> 01:02.863
I forgot there's
raincoats, duh.

01:02.865 --> 01:05.331
Abbi, hey, girl, do me a favor.

01:05.334 --> 01:06.666
What's this song?

01:11.405 --> 01:14.741
♪ Four and three
and two and one-one ♪

01:19.781 --> 01:22.415
Hey, guys, so sorry to
interrupt, but Zandir,

01:22.417 --> 01:25.352
your instructor has
actually been missing

01:25.354 --> 01:26.787
for the last 48 hours.

01:26.789 --> 01:28.855
And Bryce, his sub,
is also missing.

01:28.857 --> 01:31.591
So power slide has been
canceled for today,

01:31.593 --> 01:34.294
but you're welcome to
stay and have an hour

01:34.296 --> 01:36.229
of free sliding, okay?

01:36.231 --> 01:37.464
I can't believe this.

01:37.466 --> 01:39.466
If I don't slide,
my flaps will come back.

01:39.468 --> 01:42.302
Slide and glide is all I have.

01:42.304 --> 01:43.737
Hey, guys, listen.

01:43.739 --> 01:46.640
I don't know. I work here
and I'm already at the front

01:46.642 --> 01:50.243
of the class, so
maybe I... I could lead.

01:50.245 --> 01:51.411
I recognize you.

01:51.413 --> 01:52.312
You clean the locker room.

01:52.314 --> 01:54.648
Okay, everyone doesn't
need to chime in, but,

01:54.650 --> 01:58.518
I would absolutely love
to be your instructor.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.653
Hi, hi.

01:59.655 --> 02:02.823
You know, it's always
been a dream of mine

02:02.825 --> 02:04.057
to teach a class in this gym.

02:04.059 --> 02:06.726
It'd be such a rush of
power to experience that.

02:06.728 --> 02:08.961
It'd be wonderful.
I totally agree.

02:08.964 --> 02:10.197
I just want to
make sure everyone

02:10.199 --> 02:12.032
gets their money's worth,
'cause, like, I'm...

02:12.034 --> 02:15.735
I'm pretty close to being
a legit instructor, so...

02:17.706 --> 02:20.173
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

02:20.175 --> 02:22.075
I would really love
to do this, you know.

02:22.077 --> 02:24.811
I mean, while I'm still here.

02:24.813 --> 02:28.014
You, um, you should do it.

02:28.016 --> 02:29.082
You should teach it.

02:29.084 --> 02:31.852
Great, let's do this. Okay.

02:31.854 --> 02:33.820
Excuse me.

02:33.822 --> 02:37.490
You, <bleep>, ready to slide and glide?

02:37.492 --> 02:40.827
Let's go for some
magic gliders!

02:40.829 --> 02:41.937
Come on, pussies!

02:45.166 --> 02:46.600
Oh, God.

02:46.602 --> 02:47.901
Dude, what do you
think is worse?

02:47.903 --> 02:49.603
Constipation or diarrhea?

02:49.605 --> 02:50.770
Constipation, I think.

02:50.772 --> 02:51.972
Diarrhea, I'm like, okay.

02:51.974 --> 02:54.808
Uh, Ilana, you think
you could do me a favor

02:54.810 --> 02:56.877
and take all the
staples out of these?

02:56.879 --> 02:58.645
Then why did I spend hours

02:58.647 --> 03:00.213
stapling all these
documents together?

03:00.215 --> 03:03.316
I even ran out halfway
through to buy more staples.

03:03.318 --> 03:06.319
You took an hour-and-
48-minute break.

03:06.321 --> 03:09.322
And we have a cabinet
full of staples here.

03:09.324 --> 03:10.624
All good points by Nicole.

03:10.626 --> 03:12.559
I want to reiterate that no
one asked you to do that.

03:12.561 --> 03:19.266
In fact, I specifically said,
please, don't staple these.

03:19.268 --> 03:21.101
It's the same piece of paper.

03:21.103 --> 03:22.936
The same piece of paper.

03:22.938 --> 03:24.104
The same piece of paper.

03:24.106 --> 03:26.573
You know what?
I'll just unstaple it.

03:26.575 --> 03:28.074
Come on, faster!

03:28.076 --> 03:30.076
What's wrong with you people?

03:30.078 --> 03:31.144
Faster!

03:31.146 --> 03:32.688
Do it! Push it!

03:33.615 --> 03:34.981
Yes, Todd, what's up?

03:34.983 --> 03:36.883
Ilana, how come every
time I e-mail you,

03:36.885 --> 03:40.553
I get an out-of-office reply
that says you're in Mexico?

03:40.555 --> 03:43.556
Honestly, I do it to buy
myself some time because

03:43.558 --> 03:45.325
I am so overworked.

03:45.327 --> 03:46.993
We all are.

03:46.995 --> 03:49.162
Today I got eight e-mails.

03:49.164 --> 03:51.464
Speaking of that,
you have to start using

03:51.466 --> 03:53.466
your company e-mail address.

03:53.468 --> 03:54.167
Why, Todd?

03:54.169 --> 03:56.303
So I can be another
cog in your machine?

03:56.305 --> 03:57.270
What's my e-mail gonna be?

03:57.272 --> 03:59.506
"Business at the
white man dot biz"?

03:59.508 --> 04:01.174
What's wrong with
my personal e-mail?

04:01.176 --> 04:05.011
It's IlanaWexler@MindMyVagina.com.

04:05.013 --> 04:07.047
How do you not see that
that's inappropriate?

04:07.049 --> 04:10.517
To remind every client
immediately of a vagina?

04:10.519 --> 04:12.961
And a mind, dude.

04:14.089 --> 04:15.255
Good job today.

04:15.257 --> 04:16.255
Nice work.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.490
You need to work harder.

04:17.492 --> 04:19.091
I'm gonna be on your ass.

04:19.094 --> 04:21.528
Hey, Janice, can I speak
with you for a second? Yeah.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.063
You know, you're not an
official instructor here,

04:23.065 --> 04:25.498
but the way you took initiative
today was very solstice.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.568
Would you ever consider
being a sub?

04:28.570 --> 04:29.369
Hey, Trey?

04:29.371 --> 04:30.837
They found Bryce and Zandir.

04:30.839 --> 04:32.839
They're dead.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.678
Thank you, Jenna.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.679
Can you start today?

04:39.681 --> 04:42.248
I don't know, I mean,
it wasn't as much fun

04:42.250 --> 04:44.084
as I thought it would be.

04:44.086 --> 04:45.246
But sure.

04:46.121 --> 04:46.853
Great.

04:46.855 --> 04:47.821
Now, this a sensitive question,

04:47.823 --> 04:50.056
but would your sickly
body allow for that?

04:50.058 --> 04:51.791
I can't afford to
lose another teacher.

04:51.793 --> 04:52.959
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

04:52.961 --> 04:54.427
I mean, you clearly
have cancer.

04:54.429 --> 04:56.663
Don't be ashamed.
Oh, no.

04:56.665 --> 04:57.330
No, no, no.

04:57.332 --> 04:59.265
Me and my bandmates,
we shaved our heads

04:59.267 --> 05:00.900
to raise awareness
for our band.

05:00.902 --> 05:04.738
We're going on tour.
Oh, cool.

05:04.740 --> 05:05.739
Oh Abbi, hey,

05:05.741 --> 05:07.073
I know you're not
working today,

05:07.075 --> 05:08.208
but we could really
use some Abbi magic.

05:08.210 --> 05:11.311
There's a pube situation in
the locker room that is...

05:11.313 --> 05:12.345
unprecedented.

05:12.347 --> 05:14.114
Oh, when there's
a pube situation,

05:14.116 --> 05:15.248
you call on old Abbi.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.050
When there's something
that actually matters,

05:17.052 --> 05:19.552
you just go another way.

05:19.554 --> 05:23.256
Ilana, this thing that you
brought in for company morale?

05:23.258 --> 05:24.157
It's very distracting.

05:24.159 --> 05:26.526
You have to take it down.
Hey, come on.

05:26.528 --> 05:31.564
Everybody loves it.
Everybody hates it!

05:33.901 --> 05:35.769
Oh, I love him.

05:35.771 --> 05:38.171
Come on, it's my job
to improve morale.

05:38.173 --> 05:40.874
No, it is your job to do sales.

05:40.876 --> 05:43.476
Well, then I'd like to
transfer to corporate morale.

05:43.478 --> 05:46.946
Corporate morale is
not a department!

05:46.948 --> 05:49.549
It doesn't exist!

05:50.717 --> 05:51.217
God!

05:51.219 --> 05:53.019
Everybody's really
riding my ass today.

05:53.021 --> 05:56.022
I don't know how you keep
such a happy face on.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.228
Day 274.

06:02.230 --> 06:06.299
Five hours later, wearing
a napkin as a shirt,

06:06.301 --> 06:07.737
violently high.

06:12.574 --> 06:13.907
I'm becoming
a corporate yes man.

06:13.909 --> 06:15.775
I'm like, yes, Mr. George Bush.

06:15.777 --> 06:18.178
Whatever you say,
Mr. George Bush.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.647
What? I know, I know.

06:20.649 --> 06:23.149
Dick Cheney,
go easy on me, dude.

06:23.151 --> 06:26.086
Before I know it,
I'm gonna wake up and be 23

06:26.088 --> 06:28.021
and my life's gonna
be behind me.

06:28.023 --> 06:29.923
You know that I'm 25, right?

06:29.925 --> 06:31.458
Abbi, you are ageless.

06:31.460 --> 06:32.759
That's a different thing.
Okay.

06:32.761 --> 06:34.494
Okay, so what's this thing
you're doing tonight?

06:34.496 --> 06:37.630
Okay, so remember my hot rich
friend from NYU, Parker? Yeah.

06:37.632 --> 06:40.433
So she invited me to this,
like, SoHo rooftop party

06:40.435 --> 06:43.169
and I know you're not gonna
want to go, but I have to,

06:43.171 --> 06:45.205
I need this.
No, no, no, I want to go.

06:45.207 --> 06:46.372
I'm in.
Really?

06:46.374 --> 06:47.040
Yeah, I wanna go.

06:47.042 --> 06:48.341
Oh, my God, I thought
I'd have to go through

06:48.343 --> 06:49.676
a whole rigamarole to get you to...
No, no, no.

06:49.678 --> 06:53.279
That's dope, dude. Perfect opportunity
to introduce, like, the new me.

06:53.281 --> 06:54.714
Yeah. No more Mr. Nice Abbi,

06:54.716 --> 06:58.918
no more... no more cleaning
up other people's pubes.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.521
And, you know,
getting screwed by people

07:01.523 --> 07:03.656
that end up not having cancer.

07:03.658 --> 07:05.225
No, I'm stepping...
I am stepping it up.

07:05.227 --> 07:07.060
From here on out,
I am stepping it up.

07:07.062 --> 07:08.661
If anyone's gonna pretend
like they have cancer,

07:08.663 --> 07:10.330
it's gonna be me.

07:10.332 --> 07:12.365
You know what? I look too nice.

07:12.367 --> 07:13.533
You look really nice, yeah.

07:13.535 --> 07:14.901
No, I look like vanilla.

07:14.903 --> 07:17.854
Oh. Let's go shopping.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:26.013 --> 07:27.914
First one's fine, I think.
Yeah.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.849
Your ass looks incredible.
Okay.

07:29.851 --> 07:32.152
And your head and body, too.
Thanks.

07:32.154 --> 07:36.489
But we all know who's the
star of the show here. Ilana.

07:38.459 --> 07:42.262
That'll be $438.

07:42.264 --> 07:43.730
That's real.

07:43.732 --> 07:45.832
There.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.133
You know what? It's good.

07:47.135 --> 07:49.536
This is a great day.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.571
Let me ask you
a quick question.

07:51.573 --> 07:55.275
What is your return policy?

07:55.277 --> 07:56.409
It's 30 days.

07:56.411 --> 07:58.845
I will see you
in 30 days, then.

07:58.847 --> 08:00.180
Bitch!

08:00.182 --> 08:03.917
You still need to
sign the receipt.

08:03.919 --> 08:05.618
I would love to do that.

08:05.620 --> 08:11.124
Sorry about that
communication mishap.

08:11.126 --> 08:12.559
Okay.

08:32.380 --> 08:33.881
You know what's cool
about this party?

08:33.883 --> 08:35.015
We're the sexiest girls here.

08:35.017 --> 08:37.183
'Cause we have, like, the
fattest asses, you know?

08:37.186 --> 08:38.452
Like, we're the most <bleep>-able.

08:38.453 --> 08:44.425
Yeah, I mean, look at all these
fashion chic basic bitches.

08:44.427 --> 08:45.893
I love your dress.

08:45.895 --> 08:48.962
Thank you so much,
I literally just bought it.

08:48.964 --> 08:50.864
So cute.

08:50.866 --> 08:52.666
Oh, my God, there's Parker.

08:52.668 --> 08:54.935
Parker, hey.

08:54.937 --> 08:56.503
Ilana.

08:56.505 --> 08:58.038
Ilana Wexler.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.072
From NYU.

08:59.074 --> 09:01.082
We were roommates for a second.

09:03.311 --> 09:05.446
Oh, my God, Ilana,
you're so cute.

09:05.448 --> 09:07.548
So what's this party
for? It's amazing.

09:07.550 --> 09:09.149
It's for change.

09:09.151 --> 09:10.984
Okay.

09:10.986 --> 09:12.419
Ciao, Rodrigo!

09:12.421 --> 09:13.287
See ya.

09:13.289 --> 09:15.055
Damn, we are so hot right now.

09:15.057 --> 09:17.891
Like, paparazzi
all up in our face.

09:17.893 --> 09:19.660
You know, sometimes I feel,
like, a million miles

09:19.662 --> 09:20.494
away from the office.

09:20.496 --> 09:23.297
You know, like that's robot
me and this is real me.

09:23.299 --> 09:24.631
I'm not a robot.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.400
Let's get drunk.
Yeah, yeah.

09:26.402 --> 09:29.336
Okay, cool. Okay.

09:29.338 --> 09:31.438
Move, honk, honk.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.173
Pardon me.

09:33.175 --> 09:34.274
Out of the way, clavicle.

09:34.276 --> 09:37.911
Okay, five-nine, I can't even,
like, deal with you right now.

09:37.913 --> 09:39.179
Oh, do you guys all
have drinks already?

09:39.181 --> 09:41.849
Maybe you should, then, get the
hell away from the bar, great.

09:41.851 --> 09:44.084
Is anyone even working
at this bar?

09:44.086 --> 09:47.321
Yes, hi.

09:47.323 --> 09:48.322
What can I get you?

09:48.324 --> 09:50.591
Um, I don't know,
what are the drinks?

09:50.593 --> 09:52.893
The West Nile Coolatta
is very popular,

09:52.895 --> 09:54.695
but I would recommend
"The sex trafficking

09:54.697 --> 09:56.763
on the beach" or
"The tsunami slide."

09:56.765 --> 10:00.934
Well, I guess that I will
have two "Tsunami slide" 's,

10:00.936 --> 10:04.505
even though that name, I think,
is a little bit ridiculous.

10:04.507 --> 10:08.408
Well, 6% of the proceeds
go to the tsunami.

10:08.410 --> 10:09.676
What tsunami?

10:09.678 --> 10:11.111
Whichever one happens next.

10:11.113 --> 10:15.315
Forward thinking, I guess, then.
Or corruption.

10:15.317 --> 10:17.618
Can I interest anyone
in a dose of reality?

10:17.620 --> 10:20.153
Some mac and cheese ball
fried and truffoiled.

10:20.155 --> 10:23.257
Oh, yeah. I am
saying yes to that.

10:23.259 --> 10:28.595
Just now a child in South
America died of starvation.

10:28.597 --> 10:31.164
Would you like another?

10:31.166 --> 10:32.699
You know what? I would.
Yeah.

10:32.701 --> 10:34.902
They're very good.
They're really good.

10:34.904 --> 10:35.969
Just now a child
in South Amer...

10:35.971 --> 10:38.438
Hold on, do you just have
one fact that you repeat?

10:38.440 --> 10:43.710
Well, you're the first people
to actually want a second.

10:44.579 --> 10:47.881
Wait! Um, uh, right now...

10:47.883 --> 10:51.552
Just now, a child in South
America died of starvation.

10:51.554 --> 10:52.461
Thank you.

11:00.395 --> 11:01.929
This is the men's room.

11:01.931 --> 11:03.580
Adoy!

11:12.807 --> 11:13.874
Let's go, buddy!

11:13.876 --> 11:16.877
We got people with
full bladders out here.

11:16.879 --> 11:18.345
Occupied.

11:18.347 --> 11:19.646
No, no, no.

11:19.648 --> 11:21.114
Not today!

11:21.116 --> 11:23.617
What the hell?

11:23.619 --> 11:25.285
Well, well, well.

11:25.287 --> 11:28.355
What do we have here?

11:34.495 --> 11:34.995
Hey.

11:34.997 --> 11:36.964
Can you guys play
something else?

11:36.966 --> 11:40.701
This church bell techno song
still has 27 minutes left.

11:40.703 --> 11:42.336
When it's done,
can you play, like,

11:42.338 --> 11:44.237
I don't know, '90s hip-hop?

11:44.239 --> 11:45.639
We've been asked
to play whale songs,

11:45.641 --> 11:46.974
so that's probably
not gonna happen.

11:46.976 --> 11:50.177
You know, I can't, like,
move my damn ass to this?

11:50.179 --> 11:52.479
You know what I mean?
It's like...

11:52.481 --> 11:53.764
Bad music.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.917
All right. You know what?

11:56.919 --> 11:58.885
We can probably find
something for you.

11:58.887 --> 12:01.304
Cool. I like that
"I Dream of Jeannie" hair.

12:01.366 --> 12:03.292
Thanks.
You grant wishes?

12:05.094 --> 12:07.527
You've only done coke once?

12:07.529 --> 12:08.161
Ew.
Hey!

12:08.163 --> 12:11.898
I've cleaned more pubes than
you have on your entire body.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.651
I look at you for a second,
I can tell you got no pubes.

12:15.270 --> 12:18.171
You're right.
Damn right I'm right.

12:18.173 --> 12:19.447
I know when I'm right.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.582
Damn right I'm right!

12:28.250 --> 12:29.650
I should probably
give you some cash

12:29.652 --> 12:31.084
'cause I've coked
a lot of this.

12:32.221 --> 12:33.587
Life is infinite, you know?

12:33.589 --> 12:34.955
I'm a collector of experiences.

12:34.957 --> 12:37.824
We all are.
Oh, hundred percent, bro.

12:37.826 --> 12:38.426
It's the truth.

12:38.427 --> 12:39.993
But tonight, it's like,
what could tonight lead to?

12:39.995 --> 12:42.863
Like, my friend Abbi... she's...
Hang on.

12:42.865 --> 12:44.097
You got a friend?

12:44.099 --> 12:44.831
Who's a female?

12:44.833 --> 12:47.100
Yeah, chocolate brown
eyes, ass of an angel.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.638
Um, where's she at?

13:18.701 --> 13:20.967
Okay, there's these,
like, DJs and they're,

13:20.969 --> 13:23.036
like, cute, but like
douchey but cute and...

13:23.038 --> 13:24.971
- What's going on?
- Hey.

13:24.973 --> 13:27.507
Ho, whoa.
Ooh.

13:27.509 --> 13:30.077
That is some soft
skin right there.

13:30.079 --> 13:31.645
What kind of lotion do you use?

13:31.647 --> 13:33.246
You know, like, normal stuff.

13:33.248 --> 13:34.648
Yeah, like Occitane?

13:34.650 --> 13:37.608
Yeah, oh you, yeah.

13:39.555 --> 13:42.622
Oh my God, oh, oh, my God.

13:42.624 --> 13:44.491
You guys, we need to get
the hell out of here.

13:44.493 --> 13:45.859
Let's do it.
Oh, you guys are...

13:45.861 --> 13:46.993
You're working, you gotta spin.

13:46.995 --> 13:49.629
No, not really. No, no, no,
it's a playlist on shuffle.

13:49.631 --> 13:52.099
We can leave whenever we want.

13:52.101 --> 13:53.767
Okay.
Let's go.

13:53.769 --> 13:55.669
I gotta say goodbye
to all my friends.

13:55.671 --> 13:56.803
Bye, guys.

13:56.805 --> 13:58.939
Great.

13:58.941 --> 14:02.275
Okay, just a couple
more, I think.

14:02.277 --> 14:03.043
Oh, my God.

14:03.045 --> 14:05.428
I can't even believe
I just did seven flights.

14:07.616 --> 14:09.349
God, just hold on.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.436
A lot of flights.

14:14.256 --> 14:16.456
Welcome.
Okay.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.107
Okay.

14:20.895 --> 14:22.615
How do you do this every day?

14:26.434 --> 14:27.784
Nice backpack.

14:32.673 --> 14:34.908
You guys have a really
great apartment.

14:34.910 --> 14:36.209
So many cool pieces.

14:36.211 --> 14:38.044
Great, like, cabinets and...

14:38.046 --> 14:39.045
Right, enough.

14:39.047 --> 14:40.247
Beard, where your room at?

14:40.249 --> 14:42.410
Right back there on the right.
Oh, God, finally.

14:42.410 --> 14:43.613
Later.

14:46.687 --> 14:47.621
Oops.

14:47.623 --> 14:49.089
That's too many.

14:49.091 --> 14:51.458
You wanna?
Yeah, sure, okay.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.994
Yeah? Okay.

14:57.265 --> 14:58.165
That's dope.

14:58.167 --> 15:01.701
That's my art.
Oh, cool.

15:04.839 --> 15:06.306
What is this?

15:06.308 --> 15:07.340
That's a little embarrassing.

15:07.342 --> 15:08.308
That's my
grandfather's sweater.

15:08.310 --> 15:11.778
He's dead and this is the
last thing of his I have.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.246
Sometimes I sleep
in it, you know,

15:13.248 --> 15:14.614
it just reminds you of him.

15:14.616 --> 15:17.050
Would you put it on?

15:17.052 --> 15:18.952
Sure.

15:18.954 --> 15:20.554
Were you, like, close with him?

15:20.556 --> 15:22.956
He was, like, my best
friend, you know?

15:22.958 --> 15:24.257
We did tons of stuff together.

15:24.259 --> 15:27.394
He taught me how to fish,
skip stones, whittle.

15:27.396 --> 15:29.137
Did you, like, cry,
when he died?

15:30.666 --> 15:32.265
Can I be honest with you?

15:32.343 --> 15:33.228
Please.

15:34.047 --> 15:35.368
I cried so hard
I thought I didn't

15:35.370 --> 15:37.186
have any more tears left in me.

15:37.739 --> 15:38.705
Oh, my God.

15:38.707 --> 15:40.540
He was like my best
friend, you know?

15:40.542 --> 15:42.142
And my worst enemy.

15:42.144 --> 15:43.317
Totally.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.351
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:51.353 --> 15:52.786
I want to take this slow.

15:52.788 --> 15:55.055
It's gonna take a long
time to get my dress off,

15:55.057 --> 15:56.223
so that's gonna...

15:56.225 --> 15:57.623
It's kind of super slow.

16:09.709 --> 16:10.270
You know what?

16:10.272 --> 16:12.606
We should go up to the
roof, the view is sick.

16:12.608 --> 16:13.240
Okay.

16:13.242 --> 16:16.042
It sounds super
sexy and romantic.

16:16.044 --> 16:17.685
So romantic.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.733
Oh, my God, what the...

16:30.759 --> 16:31.992
Holy shit!
What?

16:31.994 --> 16:32.754
Are you kidding me?

16:33.529 --> 16:35.029
I just don't really understand.

16:35.031 --> 16:35.763
What'd you guys think?

16:35.765 --> 16:38.247
That we were just gonna, like,
make out up here all together?

16:39.000 --> 16:39.500
No!

16:39.502 --> 16:42.637
I just came up here 'cause the
view is so beautiful, like you.

16:42.639 --> 16:44.171
Yeah, I was like, oh, my God.

16:44.173 --> 16:45.573
I gotta take this gorgeous girl

16:45.575 --> 16:47.074
up to see my gorgeous view.

16:47.076 --> 16:48.776
Yeah, it's the best
part of our apartment,

16:48.778 --> 16:52.813
so we were both just taking
advantage of the... the view.

16:52.815 --> 16:56.083
I swear to God, dudes, this
was an honest mistake.

16:56.085 --> 16:57.725
Let me talk to you.

16:58.821 --> 17:00.755
I don't know, I mean...

17:00.757 --> 17:02.690
Ilana, he swore to God.

17:02.692 --> 17:04.925
What are you,
a Christian, dude?

17:04.928 --> 17:08.029
No, I'm not Christian,
but I respect

17:08.031 --> 17:10.631
swearing to some... higher...

17:10.633 --> 17:11.866
Why, do you want to leave?

17:11.867 --> 17:13.134
No, no, I want to stay.

17:13.136 --> 17:15.435
I'm, like, so hard right now.

17:15.438 --> 17:16.737
Ew, you're hard?

17:16.739 --> 17:18.705
Yeah, I know you don't
like the word "horny."

17:18.708 --> 17:19.807
No, I don't like
the word "horny,"

17:19.809 --> 17:23.044
but I'm not a big fan of
"hard," either, for a lady.

17:23.046 --> 17:24.645
Listen, I think
that this was just

17:24.646 --> 17:27.147
a big misunderstanding.

17:27.150 --> 17:28.950
All right.
Okay, that's fine.

17:28.952 --> 17:30.151
We're in. We're done.

17:30.153 --> 17:31.585
We understand,
it's a coincidence.

17:31.587 --> 17:32.687
You're not creepy, you're cute.

17:32.689 --> 17:35.056
All right, we're back in?
Yeah!

17:35.058 --> 17:36.097
Okay.

17:37.193 --> 17:38.893
Yeah, that's good.

17:38.895 --> 17:42.330
Oh, your beard, oh, my God.

17:42.332 --> 17:44.865
Oh, yeah.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.400
Oh.

17:46.402 --> 17:47.835
Sweet like candy.

17:47.837 --> 17:51.038
I eat sour straws
like every day.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.363
Watermelon?

17:59.548 --> 18:01.148
You're sweet like candy.

18:01.150 --> 18:03.284
No, you are.

18:03.286 --> 18:05.686
You are.
I'm what?

18:05.688 --> 18:07.221
You are sweet...

18:07.223 --> 18:08.322
Wait, wait.

18:08.324 --> 18:10.691
Maybe you could, um, just...

18:10.693 --> 18:13.094
I don't want to do, like,
a full circle thing.

18:13.096 --> 18:16.130
Oh, okay, okay.

18:19.935 --> 18:21.035
Hey, bro.
Hey.

18:21.037 --> 18:22.903
Shower's all set,
you ready to go?

18:22.905 --> 18:24.238
Yeah, awesome.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.873
I feel so gross.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.942
Not from you, just from
the bar and the...

18:27.944 --> 18:30.745
Hey, shut up.

18:30.747 --> 18:33.781
I love smelly girls.

18:47.295 --> 18:49.230
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

18:49.232 --> 18:52.333
What are you doing?

18:52.335 --> 18:54.535
What are you doing?
Guys, guys.

18:54.537 --> 18:56.804
This is just a hilarious
coincidence.

18:56.806 --> 18:58.773
I know, maybe we should
just go with it.

18:58.775 --> 19:01.008
Oh, God! No, we are
not going with it.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.743
You suck!
You're kidding me!

19:02.745 --> 19:06.147
You asses!
Insane.

19:08.617 --> 19:11.485
Of course you're not
supposed to go home with DJs.

19:11.487 --> 19:12.486
Ow! Or roommates.

19:12.488 --> 19:13.554
You got my hair,
you got my hair.

19:13.556 --> 19:16.057
Don't rip it, I still
want to return this.

19:16.059 --> 19:18.192
Oh, well, well, well.

19:18.194 --> 19:20.061
What's happening here?

19:20.063 --> 19:21.827
Can you throw on some sweats?

19:25.467 --> 19:26.067
It's insane.

19:26.069 --> 19:28.636
I mean, maybe I should just
do J-Date or something.

19:28.638 --> 19:29.870
Just, like, you
can't meet people

19:29.872 --> 19:31.572
and just go home with them.

19:31.574 --> 19:32.873
Kill us.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.109
Hold on a second,
there's an elevator?

19:35.111 --> 19:37.611
You guys made us walk
up eight flights of stairs,

19:37.613 --> 19:40.915
you sick!

19:40.917 --> 19:42.917
Get away!

19:42.919 --> 19:45.519
<Bleep> weirdos.

19:45.521 --> 19:47.121
We were so close.
I know.

19:47.123 --> 19:48.622
Ugh. You know what, though?

19:48.624 --> 19:51.725
Three out of 12 is still
a respectable number.

19:51.727 --> 19:53.327
I'm happy with it.

19:53.353 --> 19:56.487
I have to be back in the
office in six hours.

19:57.401 --> 19:59.134
What a waste.

19:59.136 --> 20:01.169
Thanks a lot, Halliburton.

20:01.171 --> 20:03.538
What does Halliburton have
to do with your work?

20:03.540 --> 20:05.073
I... I don't know.

20:05.075 --> 20:06.641
I don't know.
Okay.

20:06.643 --> 20:07.509
I'm just pissed, dude.

20:07.511 --> 20:10.145
I'm pissed though guys, like,
thought they had to trick us.

20:10.147 --> 20:12.314
Agreed. You know, with
bells and whistles.

20:12.316 --> 20:13.882
Meanwhile, if they'd
just been direct,

20:13.884 --> 20:15.917
we would have been
down and open-minded...

20:15.919 --> 20:17.419
We would not have been down.

20:17.421 --> 20:18.853
I would not have done that.

20:18.855 --> 20:21.189
I mean an orgy in
a non-sexual way.

20:21.191 --> 20:23.591
Just for, like, the Arc
de Triomphe, that's it.

20:23.593 --> 20:24.959
What's an Arc de Triomphe?

20:24.961 --> 20:28.096
It's when two dudes go down on
us, this is how I picture it.

20:28.098 --> 20:31.772
And they're butt to butt and
then you and I do Oprah hands.

20:35.071 --> 20:37.138
Oh, I see, I see now.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.373
Totally non-sexual.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.308
We just stare at
each other, right?

20:40.310 --> 20:41.943
As the dudes go down on
us at the same time?

20:41.945 --> 20:43.745
Yeah, exactly. So we're
making a lot of eye contact.

20:43.747 --> 20:46.548
Exactly, it's like a feminism thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:46.550 --> 20:49.331
I'm being sarcastic.
Oh, yeah.
