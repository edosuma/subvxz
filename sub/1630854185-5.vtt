00:04.526 --> 00:07.050
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas... Something brought you back.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.051
Grace Huang.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.792
Rock star in my program.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.054
I got her a job at the Eclipse.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.186
She left work one night

00:12.186 --> 00:13.622
and no one's
seen her since.

00:13.622 --> 00:14.623
<i>I don't know what you think</i>

00:14.623 --> 00:15.580
<i>happened to this girl,</i>

00:15.580 --> 00:16.494
but I want to help.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.235
Oh, Jodi, your face!

00:18.235 --> 00:20.150
What have you gotten me into,
Catherine?

00:20.150 --> 00:21.543
<i>I went to the desert today.</i>

00:21.543 --> 00:23.153
<i>It has to be Grace's grave.</i>

00:23.153 --> 00:24.285
<i>They know I'm looking.</i>

00:24.285 --> 00:25.503
They moved her body.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.162
- How bad is it?
- Found her unconscious.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.163
<i>But she's stable.</i>

00:33.163 --> 00:34.556
I'm sorry.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.777
Director Roby,
good to have you back.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.964
Champagne?

00:54.184 --> 00:58.101
♪ You got me running,
going out of my mind ♪

01:00.364 --> 01:03.846
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Roland Woodall.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.414
And as the least intelligent
person at this party,

01:06.414 --> 01:08.198
who better to say a few words?

01:09.721 --> 01:12.202
Now, technically I'm a lawyer,

01:12.202 --> 01:15.292
but what my job really is,
it's building relationships

01:15.292 --> 01:17.990
between the brilliant scientists
of our university

01:17.990 --> 01:19.949
and brilliant investors

01:19.949 --> 01:22.125
who want to reward them,

01:22.125 --> 01:23.561
partner with them,

01:23.561 --> 01:25.998
change the world with them.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.131
People like
Professor Grady Morrow.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.698
- No. No.
- Yes.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.876
Take a seat, Roland.
You're drunk.

01:33.876 --> 01:36.008
Yeah, well.
Yeah, you're right, Professor.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.924
I am. And I might be
a little premature.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.404
But when the ink is dry,

01:40.404 --> 01:42.537
your new
electromagnetic autoclave

01:42.537 --> 01:46.410
is going to make field medicine
safer for the entire planet.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.413
Just as soon as Joe Milligan
gets out his checkbook.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.546
Thank you, Joe. Thank you.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.374
Tonight, we celebrate

01:53.374 --> 01:57.204
what happens when our university
gets tech transfer right.

go to our whole team, right?

02:10.173 --> 02:12.001
How about the money?

02:12.001 --> 02:14.786
It was an honor
to work with you,

02:14.786 --> 02:16.571
- Professor Morrow.
- Thank you, Luther.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.834

I've eaten like one
sleeve of saltines all day.

02:58.961 --> 03:02.704
We'll get you a steak
after you make a new friend.

03:02.704 --> 03:05.010
High roller's
waiting for you.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.187
Asked for you by name.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.755
- Asked real nice.
- Mm.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.150
I hear someone in here

03:14.150 --> 03:15.760
wants to have a good...

03:17.066 --> 03:18.285
Come on.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.243
You're showing up
to my job now?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.810
You've been hiding
from me, Monica.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.464
That's because I don't want
to talk to you.

03:23.464 --> 03:24.813
I'm gonna have you bounced.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.510
Your roommate is dead.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.033
Grace.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.558
She was murdered.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.037
Wh-What?

03:32.037 --> 03:34.344
Someone took her.
Buried her in the desert.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.259
By the time I got there,
they had moved her.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.392
But I know that it was
her grave.

03:38.392 --> 03:41.177
I thought that--
That she just ran off.

03:41.177 --> 03:44.441
I-I didn't...
What happened?

03:44.441 --> 03:45.834
That's what I've been
trying to find out.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.053
You know that Grace
was studying forensics.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.490
I was trying to help her.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.274
In a way, I still am.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.884
What do you want from me?

03:52.884 --> 03:54.408
You two lived together.

03:54.408 --> 03:58.412
I just want to know...
did she say anything?

03:58.412 --> 04:02.024
Did you, did you see something
that just seemed off?

04:03.504 --> 04:05.941
- What is it?
- Nothing.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.248
Monica... Nothing.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.728
This is my job.

04:10.728 --> 04:13.122
- You need to leave.
- You know something.

04:13.122 --> 04:16.168
Come to my job.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.084
We'll talk.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.012
Hey.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.493
Welcome to the worst
after-party of all time.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.539
Yeah, dispatch said every
ambulance in Las Vegas

04:38.539 --> 04:39.975
was headed here.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.933
Bet you wish you were still
on medical leave.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.414
I'm ready to work.
This was a university function.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.329
Now there's 30 folks
headed to the ICU.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.939
Guests are too old
for a kegger gone wrong.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.290
What've we got?
Mass poisoning? Gas leak?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.727
I don't know. Finding out.
That's the fun part, right?

04:52.727 --> 04:54.685
Yeah, looks like a hoot.

04:54.685 --> 04:55.947
Beau, you ever worn
one of these before?

04:55.947 --> 04:57.514
Yeah. Halloween.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.689
I was Dustin Hoffman
in <i>Outbreak.</i>

04:58.689 --> 04:59.777
Two years in a row.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.345
Well, if you thought the job
was hard before,

05:02.345 --> 05:04.695
wait until you do it
inside a giant sandwich bag.

05:04.695 --> 05:05.870
Suit up, gentlemen.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.524
It'll take a while,

05:07.524 --> 05:09.265
but as soon as LVFD does
their sweep, we're heading in.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.926
Oh...

05:17.926 --> 05:20.624
What'd I just step in?

05:20.624 --> 05:24.411
That... is vomit. Ugh.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.282
And it's everywhere.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.024
Come on.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.395
Got a body over here.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.093
Looks like he fell
from that ledge.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.662
There's another one
facedown in the pool.

05:58.662 --> 05:59.837
This guy looks like

05:59.837 --> 06:01.926
he just laid down and died.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.934

06:51.889 --> 06:55.023
So, all these victims,
who are they?

06:55.023 --> 06:57.155
Yeah, uh,
that's Roland Woodall,

06:57.155 --> 06:58.896
he's a lawyer
at the college.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.724
This is Melany Petersen.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.205
She is an administrator
in the dean's office.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.859
And Chavez is still
trying to ID

07:04.859 --> 07:06.600
the guy who took a nosedive.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.992
So at first blush,

07:07.992 --> 07:09.559
we've got drowning,
head trauma

07:09.559 --> 07:11.474
and some sort of
heart attack or stroke?

07:11.474 --> 07:13.781
I mean, we don't know for sure
until Sonya does the autopsies,

07:13.781 --> 07:15.260
but they do seem like
they're connected.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.523
It's hard to believe

07:16.523 --> 07:17.915
that it's accidental
or some coincidence.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.395
Detector tubes
aren't picking up

07:19.395 --> 07:20.483
any toxins in the air.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.397
Looks like
we can lose the suits.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.703
Absolutely not.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.879
This is not some Level 2
test facility.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.447
Out here in the field, you never
know what you're up against.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.623
If there was any risk,
the colorimetrics...

07:29.623 --> 07:31.059
Something out here killed
three people

07:31.059 --> 07:32.756
and sent a bunch of people
to the hospital.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.237
We rule out every single

07:35.237 --> 07:37.152
possible toxin
that our lab can detect.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.197
Until then, you zip it
and you keep it zipped.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.503
You got it?

07:40.503 --> 07:42.462
Yes, ma'am.
I'll start collecting samples.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.680
Thank you.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.989
You all right?
Huh?

07:47.989 --> 07:49.817
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.732
I mean, you cannot be
too careful.

07:51.732 --> 07:54.212
Hey,
anybody got a syringe?

07:54.212 --> 07:55.475
Yeah.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.914
I need one with an 18-gauge
needle. I think I'm out.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.178
You taking his vitreous humor?

08:03.178 --> 08:05.615
- Mm-hmm.
- Here.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.791
If everybody got poisoned,
eye fluid might tell us.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.967
It's what made them all sick.
Not my favorite chore, but...

08:09.967 --> 08:12.666
But the juice is worth
the squeeze, right?

08:30.335 --> 08:31.685
Why are you dead?

08:31.685 --> 08:34.339
And why are you alive?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.132
All right. Thanks.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.961
Got an ID on the older guy
who fell. Joe Milligan.

08:46.961 --> 08:49.267
COO of a defense contractor
called Whitmore Hewett.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.966
Well, don't say
that name three times,

08:51.966 --> 08:53.750
or a Javelin missile
might blow you up.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.535
I knew that party felt familiar.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.059
Not your first
mass casualty gala?

08:58.059 --> 09:01.192
It's not my first
tech transfer party.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.717
Lawyers like Woodall,
they gin up grants and deals

09:03.717 --> 09:05.457
with big corporations
like Whitmore Hewett.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.329
They're the middlemen between
the talent and the money.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.723
They're the kind of folks that
incentivize the next Theranos.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.247
So we got a dead shifty lawyer

09:12.247 --> 09:14.292
and a defense tycoon.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.251
Probably a long list
of folks with motive.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.862
Maybe some of the survivors
can help us narrow things down.

09:18.862 --> 09:19.950
Ride to the hospital with us.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.648
If this was an airborne toxin,

09:21.648 --> 09:23.345
then we might find it
on the clothes of a survivor.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.999
Or the killer.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.131
I'll start running the champagne
and food through LCMS.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.481
No, no, no. Allie and Folsom
are gonna do that.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.832
You're coming
to the hospital with us.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.138
Let the teaching moments continue.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.415
It's gonna be okay.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.548
Let's just get you back
into bed, okay?

09:52.548 --> 09:54.289
So, how do you guys
want to play this?

09:54.289 --> 09:57.422
Good cop, bad CSI?
Bad cop, good CSI?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.424
Good cop, emotionally
unavailable CSI?

09:59.424 --> 10:01.557
You just talk
- to them, man.
- And you swab, Beau.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.863
<i>And collect the clothes.</i>

10:04.952 --> 10:05.996
Um...

10:07.389 --> 10:08.738
Excuse me.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.349
- Dr. Parish.
- Yes.

10:11.349 --> 10:14.004
Hi, I'm Dr. Maxine Roby,
crime scene investigator.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.266
How are you feeling?

10:15.266 --> 10:16.833
Exhausted.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.530
And not too hopeful.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.098
A dozen research scientists
at that party.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.579
Three MDs, including me.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.842
And none of us
have the first clue.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.410
But the hospital's blood
toxicology report

10:28.410 --> 10:29.846
isn't back yet, so...

10:29.846 --> 10:32.109
I trained the doctor
running this place.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.068
I had her rush my tests.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.983
Couldn't find anything.

10:35.983 --> 10:39.203
She's stalling,
doing damage control.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.858
If your team actually
finds out what did this...

10:41.858 --> 10:43.773
throw them a line.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.213
Miss Nix,

10:49.213 --> 10:51.041
I know you're in pain.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.218
Can you tell me if you saw
anything strange or suspicious?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.266
I was standing up.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.311
And then I wasn't.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.922
That's all I remember.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.277
Oh, now that's interesting.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.366
Did, uh, did that happen
at the party?

11:11.366 --> 11:14.021
No, I was, I was welding
for Professor Morrow.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.893
I'm a graduate
assistant in his lab.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.765
Electromagnetics, engineering.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.375
That's-that's the job.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.159
Oh, cool. Cool.
Yeah, I used to be a chemist.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.378
No, seriously.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.119
Now I'm, you know...

11:25.119 --> 11:27.643
Using your brain for justice.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.253
Right on, man.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.779
Hey, can you tell me
if Professor Morrow's okay?

11:32.779 --> 11:36.478
He left the party early
and no one has seen him since.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.350
Oh, he left before
everybody got sick?

11:39.350 --> 11:40.787
Yeah.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.441
Uh, I'm gonna make sure
that he's okay.

11:43.441 --> 11:46.967
Oh, uh, can you do me a favor?
Do you mind staying here?

11:46.967 --> 11:49.273
I can barely walk.
I'm-I'm not going anywhere.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.757
- Mm?
- I got a suspect.

12:03.940 --> 12:07.596
Roland Woodall, Joe Milligan
and Melanie Petersen.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.163
Mm-hmm.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.730
Some of my grad students
were at that party.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.253
Are-are they...?

12:12.253 --> 12:13.689
They're stable.
They're being held

12:13.689 --> 12:15.125
for observation
at the hospital.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.387
Oh, good.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.825
Now, we spoke with
one of them.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.304
Luther Cannel.
Mm-hmm.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.784
He said you left
the party early.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.264
Why was that?

12:23.264 --> 12:26.833
Detective, do I look like
I belong at a party?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.400
I don't know, Professor.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.359
Did you happen to eat anything
while you were there?

12:31.359 --> 12:33.056
Yes, I-I ate everything.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.797
And then I got the hell
out of there.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.800
It was either that
or listening to Roland Woodall

12:37.800 --> 12:40.411
- drone on and on and on.
- And you're feeling okay?

12:40.411 --> 12:42.196
Yes, yes. Um...

12:43.719 --> 12:45.242
You don't think that I...

12:45.242 --> 12:47.027
We don't know yet.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.030
But I'd like the crime lab
to verify your story

12:50.030 --> 12:51.901
that you ate everything.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.774
Verify my story-- how?

12:56.688 --> 12:57.820
Oh.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.259
You're a man
of science, right?

13:02.259 --> 13:05.132
You wouldn't mind
terribly, um...

13:05.132 --> 13:06.655
producing a sample?

13:08.265 --> 13:11.312
You're not seeing any evidence
of a chemical attack?

13:11.312 --> 13:13.314
Not unless
you count alcohol.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.969
Looks like Mr. Milligan
attacked his liver with it

13:15.969 --> 13:17.448
pretty routinely.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.972
You think he got drunk
and fell?

13:18.972 --> 13:20.451
He definitely fell.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.150
Exactly why or how,
I couldn't say yet.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.414
I'm just getting started here.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.632
Ah.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.594
Wonder if
Melany Petersen fell.

13:32.594 --> 13:35.379
She... she has epilepsy.
She could've had a seizure,

13:35.379 --> 13:37.164
toppled over into the pool...

13:37.164 --> 13:39.775
okay, what part of "I haven't
done these autopsies yet"

13:39.775 --> 13:41.385
are you not understanding?

13:41.385 --> 13:44.780
My favorite part of going
to the movies is the previews.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.784
Fine.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.568
All right.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.962
So that guy, Woodall.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.095
No visible explanation
for his collapse, right?

13:55.095 --> 13:56.444
Right.
You see that?

13:56.444 --> 13:58.315
That's an implanted
insulin pump.

13:58.315 --> 14:01.275
Appears to be empty,
so that's where I'll start.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.494
When I get in.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.061
Three deaths

14:05.061 --> 14:07.411
in the same place
at the same time.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.544
It can't really be
a coincidence, can it?

14:09.544 --> 14:10.850
I mean, and then,
how do you account

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
for all the people
sick in the ICU?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.159
Well, have you ever heard of
mass sociogenic illness?

14:17.291 --> 14:19.423
No, it doesn't sound like
something I want to catch.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.558
When a few people
in a large group fall ill,

14:23.558 --> 14:25.560
sometimes the rest fear
that they've been exposed

14:25.560 --> 14:27.475
to something dangerous.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.042
So monkey see,

14:29.042 --> 14:30.565
monkey have a collective
panic attack.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.698
<i>Never underestimate
the power of anxiety.</i>

14:33.698 --> 14:35.657
<i>It can cause
convulsions, paralysis,</i>

14:35.657 --> 14:37.398
empty stomachs...

14:38.834 --> 14:40.618
Workplace annoyance.

14:41.924 --> 14:45.014
Hey, uh... maybe I'll have
better answers

14:45.014 --> 14:46.886
when I'm left alone
to do my job.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.106
No, yeah.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.284
<i>Monica, thanks for coming in.</i>

14:54.284 --> 14:56.504
You said if I ever saw
anything weird...

14:56.504 --> 14:58.245
Someone gave that to Grace.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.073
- Day before she went missing.
- Where?
At the Eclipse?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.944
No.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.511
Grace and I had a side hustle,

15:03.511 --> 15:05.905
serving drinks at
this private poker room.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.210
High rollers from, like,

15:07.210 --> 15:09.343
"Herka-blergastan."

15:09.343 --> 15:10.866
Same guys every week.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.869
- This is some tip.
- I looked it up.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.392
It's worth as much as a car.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.090
I've been so tempted
to pawn it.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.483
So, who was this guy?

15:19.483 --> 15:21.094
Grace wouldn't tell me.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.922
But she said the guy
who gave it to her

15:22.922 --> 15:24.967
told her to stop
asking questions.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.274
- About what?
- I don't know.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.840
But she must've been
into something.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.320
Something that got her killed.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.975
I figured since you're,
like, the forensic lady,

15:32.975 --> 15:34.542
maybe you could help
find this guy.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.500
Maybe. With your help.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.980
When's the next time
you're working

15:37.980 --> 15:39.329
at this private poker room?

15:39.329 --> 15:41.549
Tonight. Why?

15:48.686 --> 15:51.211
That's from your suspect.
He's perfectly healthy.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.343
Claims he ate and drank
everything at the party.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.867
But I'll let you
- be the judge.
- What is that smell?

15:55.867 --> 15:57.391
Got him to give me a sample.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.002
Oh.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.961
Mm-mm.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.094
Ugh.
Dude!
I didn't bring that

16:05.094 --> 16:06.966
all the way over here
for my health.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.837
The professor wasn't lying.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.056
Look.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.454
So there was no need
for him to...

16:17.454 --> 16:22.764
I will say it shows
he was willing to help...

16:22.764 --> 16:24.026
Mm-hmm....with the investigation.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.375
We need all the help
we can get.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.638
Nothing's jumping out
as a cause?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.684
Nothing yet. No.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.816
Vitreous humor
from Mr. Woodall's eye

16:31.816 --> 16:34.297
showed no presence
of known poisons.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.560
We're on the hunt
for more exotic chemical

16:36.560 --> 16:37.822
and biological agents.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.694
Well.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.175
I will leave you to it.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.959
I'm gonna circle back
at the survivors

16:43.959 --> 16:45.830
who were too sick
to talk to earlier.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.747
Very peculiar.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.414
Hey.
Hey.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.068
Oh, sorry, boss.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.766
GC/MS on the outdoor
surface swabs gave us bupkis.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.117
It's negative
for vesicant agents,

17:11.117 --> 17:15.512
choking agents, bacteria,
fungi and rickettsia.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.687
I-I don't know what it is
we're missing.

17:16.687 --> 17:17.993
Okay, sometimes it helps

17:17.993 --> 17:19.821
to approach
a problem backward.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.084
How would you poison
an entire party?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.346
Oh, that's easy.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.782
Venom from
a blue-ringed octopus.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.610
Tetrodotoxin.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.785
I mean, it's a thousand times
more powerful than cyanide.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.309
What you want to do,

17:29.309 --> 17:31.137
is you want to put it
on the stemware before...

17:34.618 --> 17:36.229
I'm so sorry, Beau,

17:36.229 --> 17:38.535
but you're no longer invited
to my birthday party.

17:38.535 --> 17:41.408
Keep thinking outside the box.
I think our killer did.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.326
- It's crazy, isn't it?
- Mm.

17:46.326 --> 17:50.286
That everything we know
fits inside 1,300 grams of meat.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.549
Pretty easy to believe
about some people.

17:52.549 --> 17:55.204
How come nobody down here
ever likes you?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.988
- I have no idea.
- Hopefully,

17:56.988 --> 17:59.078
Mr. Milligan's 1,300 grams
can tell us more

17:59.078 --> 18:00.644
about what happened
than you've managed.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.820
FBI!Looks secure.

18:02.820 --> 18:03.952
Anita, Mike, seal the exits.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.432
Dale, you two gather
the clothes.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.042
Hey, buddy. You can't be
in here. What is this?

18:07.042 --> 18:08.217
Arthur Fenwick. FBI.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.523
I need you to put
the blade down...

18:09.523 --> 18:10.828
I'm in the middle
of an autopsy.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.221
And I just need to finish... No, ma'am.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.005
You are to cease at once.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.659
These bodies are the property
of the United States government.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.053
These bodies are our best
evidence. That's our whole case.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.142
It's not your case anymore.
It's a federal matter now.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.666
Agent Fenwick, you know
that my crime lab has

18:22.666 --> 18:25.016
every resource we need to... I'm sure

18:25.016 --> 18:27.584
you folks have done
some super work so far.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.673
But we'll be taking it
from here.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.506
Do you remember
who you're talking to, Arthur?

18:36.506 --> 18:39.248
I've known the director
much longer than you have.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.163
Everyone in D.C. knows
that the Vegas crime lab

18:41.163 --> 18:43.209
can handle any kind
of biological attack,

18:43.209 --> 18:45.907
if that's what we're
even talking about.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.301
That doesn't look promising.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.955
I can count on absolutely
no hands the number of times

18:50.955 --> 18:52.696
I've seen the Feds
claim jurisdiction

18:52.696 --> 18:54.176
and then stand down.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.352
But three people died
in my town,

18:56.352 --> 18:58.049
- we're solving this.
- Yeah.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.356
All right, what'd they
leave us to work with?

19:00.356 --> 19:03.054
A few blood tests
- that tell us nothing.
- Mm.

19:03.054 --> 19:06.014
Hey, so, uh,
I got a long shot here.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.320
- But promise you won't laugh.
- No.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.322
Fair enough, um...

19:11.585 --> 19:14.196
What if there was
a fourth decedent at the scene?

19:14.196 --> 19:16.459
One that we could
actually examine.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.551
Found him
in the koi pond.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.206
I measured the rat's
metabolomics with GC/MS

19:24.206 --> 19:25.512
to find the postmortem interval.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.818
Levels of his proteinogenic
amino acids--

19:27.818 --> 19:29.124
threonine,
tyrosine, lysine--

19:29.124 --> 19:31.605
they all show
the rat's time of death...

19:31.605 --> 19:33.346
same as the victims.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.175
So your suggestion
is I necropsy a rodent

19:36.175 --> 19:37.698
to solve a mass casualty event

19:37.698 --> 19:39.482
that's been taken away
on federal authority?

19:40.570 --> 19:41.789
Why not?

19:41.789 --> 19:43.356
We play the rats we're dealt.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.978
Did you get our little friend
to snitch?

19:56.978 --> 19:58.588
Not sure yet.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.068
Maybe you can help.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.376
You see these
ill-defined clusters?

20:04.942 --> 20:06.509
Hmm. Tumors?

20:06.509 --> 20:08.032
That's what I
thought initially.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.512
But it's not.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.819
The rat suffered from
distributed infarctions.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.821
Mini strokes.
Happened all at once.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.214
H-How do you know that?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.954
There's nothing there
showing cause.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.695
If the rat had been living
with a disease this severe,

20:18.695 --> 20:19.740
there'd be evidence.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.959
And, pshh, there just isn't.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.091
What could cause this?

20:23.091 --> 20:24.571
I'm throwing darts

20:24.571 --> 20:27.138
without access
to the human victims, but...

20:27.138 --> 20:30.403
I found traces of hydrogen
peroxide in the rat's lungs.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.014
If everyone at the party
inhaled enough of it...

20:33.014 --> 20:35.016
I think I might know
what happened.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.282
Oh, hey.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.806
Folsom, I'm on
with the Bureau.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.721
This is Monica,
Grace's roommate

20:44.721 --> 20:46.332
that I was telling
you about.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.029
Why don't the two
of you get started.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.379
Josh Folsom.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.076
So, Catherine mentioned

20:52.076 --> 20:53.600
that you're gonna be
helping with Grace's case.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.297
Just doing what I can.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.821
She had me swipe a few things
from a poker game.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.389
Catherine said it might tell you
which of these high rollers

21:00.389 --> 21:01.825
gave Grace a watch?

21:01.825 --> 21:04.480
I don't know how, exactly.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.438
Guy named

21:05.438 --> 21:07.135
<i>Floryan chewed on this.</i>

21:09.877 --> 21:12.140
This is from Mario Albon.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.664
<i>He used that</i>

21:14.664 --> 21:16.579
to wipe his mouth.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.929
<i>Mikel Koslov.</i>

21:18.929 --> 21:20.279
<i>Chain-smokes these.</i>

21:22.063 --> 21:23.282
And there's

21:23.282 --> 21:24.326
just one last thing.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.241
Sure. Give it to me.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.771
What is...

21:34.771 --> 21:35.816
happening?

21:35.816 --> 21:37.948
I'm not really sure.

21:37.948 --> 21:41.169
Emil Lazov is...
really handsy.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.867
You know, this dress
is evidence, right?

21:44.868 --> 21:46.566
Absolutely.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.263
Monica,
why don't you come with me.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.092
We'll, uh, figure out something
you can wear out of here.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.313
It was nice to meet you.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.620
<i>It might not have been
what it looked like.</i>

21:57.620 --> 21:59.448
- Mm-hmm.
- Three unrelated deaths.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.276
What if, instead,

22:01.276 --> 22:04.192
they were all caused
by hydrogen peroxide poisoning?

22:04.192 --> 22:05.759
Sonya found some
in the rat's lungs.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.502
Sorry...

22:12.287 --> 22:13.680
Okay,
it's an interesting theory,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.246
but most of the evidence
would have degraded

22:15.246 --> 22:17.248
into water and oxygen
by the time we got there.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.033
Yeah, I know.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.862
It's deadly
and then completely innocuous.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.429
It's the perfect poison.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.648
It could explain the
vomiting and the seizures.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.085
- Mm-hmm.
- But how do 50 people and a rat

22:28.085 --> 22:30.305
inhale that much H2O2
at the same time?

22:30.305 --> 22:31.785
Well, it was 92 degrees
that night.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.395
<i>And the mansion had
patio misters</i>

22:33.395 --> 22:34.831
<i>to keep the party guests cool.</i>

22:34.831 --> 22:36.355
What if one

22:36.355 --> 22:38.052
<i>of the clever engineers
in attendance</i>

22:38.052 --> 22:40.141
<i>came up with this elegant
killing solution?</i>

22:40.141 --> 22:41.795
And if you're lucky,
you can still find some H2O2

22:41.795 --> 22:42.796
in the nozzles.

22:42.796 --> 22:43.884
We'd need more than luck.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.320
We'd need access.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.930
It's the FBI's crime scene.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.323
Not anymore.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.194
Catherine says
they're done with it.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.414
It'll be picked over,
but it's ours.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.850
Go suit up.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.461
- Love it.
- And, Allie,

22:55.461 --> 22:57.201
treat it like a fresh scene.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.420
Full suits
until you retest.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.421
Seriously?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.422
Yeah.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.990
Then go find out
what they missed.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.694
Anything in the misters, Beau?

23:11.694 --> 23:13.217
No. Bone-dry.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.958
I don't think the FBI folks
checked these things.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.091
Th-There's
no hydrogen peroxide here.

23:17.091 --> 23:20.355
Maybe it spilled out, evaporated?

23:20.355 --> 23:23.010
Let's check
the filtration system.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.751
There might be some left
in there.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.453
Look.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.282
All the misters
lead here.

23:35.326 --> 23:40.593
Let's see what is behind
canister number three.

23:44.771 --> 23:47.861
Just ordinary filtered water.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.560
There's no sign of
hydrogen peroxide here.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.781
So, let's walk
the property again.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.002
Uh... Hey, guys?

23:59.002 --> 24:00.047
Yeah.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.222
Come have a look at this.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.659
Aw. Poor fish.

24:03.659 --> 24:04.834
What happened?

24:04.834 --> 24:05.966
They were fine

24:05.966 --> 24:07.446
when we left a couple days ago.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.360
I don't want to be
the one to tell Sonya

24:09.360 --> 24:11.275
that she's got to necropsy
a bunch of dead fish.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.669
Well, I think you can skip it.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.237
Might've just killed our
hydrogen peroxide theory. Look.

24:16.237 --> 24:17.891
It's what they treat
the water with.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.458
It prevents algae.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.416
It's full
of highly concentrated H2O2.

24:21.416 --> 24:25.725
So, the hydrogen peroxide
in that rat's lungs

24:25.725 --> 24:27.640
was never aerosolized.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.337
Nobody else breathed it in.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.122
The rat just respired H2O2
in this water.

24:32.122 --> 24:35.038
Yeah, but what made him
stroke out and fall in?

24:35.038 --> 24:37.084
And why are all
the fish dead?

24:37.084 --> 24:38.607
Two different answers
to those questions.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.523
Sadly, I can only answer
for the fish.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.612
The oxygenation pump died.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.527
Poor koi eventually suffocated.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.617
But, wait, that pump
looks brand-new.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.490
Either this place
is cursed or there's...

24:51.490 --> 24:52.795
What?

24:54.318 --> 24:55.450
Wait, where
are you going?

24:55.450 --> 24:56.712
I got to check on something.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.464
Oh. I know
that face.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.641
He's either found
something or he's hungry.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.991
There's a pattern
of malfunctioning electronics,

25:14.991 --> 25:16.297
from the pond pump
all the way in here.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.299
- Meaning what?
- I don't know yet,

25:18.299 --> 25:20.127
but I think we should check
everything with a circuit,

25:20.127 --> 25:21.171
mark it on this map.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.825
And if it works,
mark an "O."

25:23.826 --> 25:25.915
If it's on the fritz,
mark an "X."

25:46.240 --> 25:48.198
Looks like an acute angle

25:48.198 --> 25:50.200
ending in a vertex.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.943
Yeah. Assuming you mean it
all comes to a point here?

25:53.943 --> 25:56.206
- Mm.
- Or it started there.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.600
Something that caused
an electrical disturbance.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.691
So, we're standing
in the vertex.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.519
What are we looking for?

26:04.519 --> 26:06.739
Something that doesn't belong.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.131
Hmm.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.705
Guys, one of these plugs
is not like the others.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.410
Whoa.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.803
And it's powering something

26:27.803 --> 26:29.413
that's not connected
to the pool.

26:31.633 --> 26:32.808
You see this long barrel?

26:32.808 --> 26:34.593
That's a solenoid.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.377
It has
an incredibly strong magnet.

26:37.552 --> 26:38.858
And this over here

26:38.858 --> 26:39.859
is the beefiest
solid-state power supply

26:39.859 --> 26:41.556
I've ever seen.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.864
The hell are we looking at?

26:44.864 --> 26:46.866
The answer.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.389
I think this thing is a weapon.

26:58.834 --> 26:59.922
Okay. Thank you.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.013
Let me call
you back.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.235
Okay, you two look like you're
fitting to sell me something.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.672
No, no, but we are gonna
tell you why everybody got sick

27:10.672 --> 27:12.021
at that tech transfer party.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.545
- That?
- Mm-hmm. That.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.243
Okay, I'm gonna need
to hear more.

27:16.243 --> 27:19.376
We found this with the pool
equipment at the crime scene.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.204
What do you know
about Havana syndrome?

27:21.204 --> 27:22.902
Just what I read in the news.

27:22.902 --> 27:25.208
A bunch of State Department
folks got sick in Cuba.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.862
And they thought they
were getting zapped

27:26.862 --> 27:29.778
by some Russian
invisio-ray thing.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.475
But I thought that was a
bunch of psychogenic hooey.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.129
Y-Yeah, it probably was
in their heads.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.915
But... what they
were afraid of,

27:35.915 --> 27:38.308
there's some real science
behind it, and it's...

27:38.308 --> 27:39.962
This.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.921
A directed-energy weapon.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.574
I mean,
it's really

27:43.574 --> 27:45.315
just a high-powered
electromagnet

27:45.315 --> 27:46.708
with some important modifications.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.318
At low levels,

27:48.318 --> 27:50.103
electromagnetic devices
have broad use. But...

27:50.103 --> 27:52.105
turn up the amount... So we're-we're...

27:52.105 --> 27:54.498
we're killing people
with magnets now?

27:54.498 --> 27:56.239
Well, it's
not exactly lethal, but...

27:56.239 --> 27:57.414
it ain't fun.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.286
Directed-energy weapon
sends pulses

27:59.286 --> 28:00.940
that synchronize
with brain waves,

28:00.940 --> 28:03.507
causing tens of thousands
of synapses to fire all at once.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.685
<i>We're talking transcranial
magnetic stimulation.</i>

28:06.685 --> 28:09.426
<i>Seizures. Microinfarctions. Vomiting.</i>

28:09.426 --> 28:12.168
It's an all-you-can-eat buffet
of neurological cataclysms.

28:12.168 --> 28:15.606
You wet yourself, you soil
yourself, forget how to walk.

28:15.606 --> 28:18.740
Maybe you fall to your death
or drown in a pool.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.394
I'm not sure I'm
buying this one.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.309
I think
we can prove it.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.527
How?

28:23.527 --> 28:26.356
W-We'd have
to turn it on again.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.315
- Right.
- Which--
I promise,

28:28.315 --> 28:29.795
we won't kill anybody.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.324
All right. Got duplicates
of the electronics

28:37.324 --> 28:39.065
that failed at the party.

28:39.065 --> 28:42.503
And one that we suspect
failed inside Roland Woodall.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.418
Everybody out, Allie?

28:44.418 --> 28:45.767
Yes, boss. Copy.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.247
We're all out
in the parking lot.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.770
Okay, copy.
It's good.

28:48.770 --> 28:49.771
Okay.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.822
Um, the thing
about a directed weapon

28:56.822 --> 28:58.867
is the energy
- is directed away.
- Mm.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.956
So you're safe
- back here.
- Okay. Okay.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.263
- Okay.
- Okay. I'm good.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.746
Three, two, one.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.757
That's enough.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.584
Y'all okay?

29:20.584 --> 29:21.803
- Yeah.
- You good?

29:21.803 --> 29:23.283
Yeah. Yeah,
we're all okay.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.806
- That's it.
- I mean,
the electronics aren't.

29:24.806 --> 29:25.938
Yeah.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.809
But-but three toasters
didn't die.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.724
- Three people did, right?
- Yeah, but the killer

29:29.724 --> 29:31.552
couldn't have known someone
would have a seizure and drown

29:31.552 --> 29:32.901
or stumble off of a ledge.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.511
But if you knew
what these babies could do,

29:34.511 --> 29:36.296
you could count on an
electronic pump malfunctioning.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.211
This insulin pump
is identical to the one

29:38.211 --> 29:39.299
<i>inside Roland Woodall.</i>

29:39.299 --> 29:40.996
<i>See how it malfunctioned?</i>

29:40.996 --> 29:44.434
If the killer knew that he was
type 1 and had a pump,

29:44.434 --> 29:47.089
this whole thing
may not have been designed

29:47.089 --> 29:48.961
as a mass casualty attack.

29:48.961 --> 29:51.180
It could have been a singular
homicide that turned into one.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.573
But how many people

29:52.573 --> 29:54.444
in the world know enough
about electromagnets

29:54.444 --> 29:56.185
to make one of these?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.708
I know of one.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.929
And he didn't stick around
to get sick.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.890
Professor Morrow.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.674
Sir, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.545
What is this?

30:08.545 --> 30:10.504
Haven't you harassed
me enough already?

30:10.504 --> 30:11.679
ProfessorMorrow,

30:11.679 --> 30:12.593
what's going on here?

30:12.593 --> 30:13.768
I don't know, Luther.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.422
I-I haven't done anything.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.816
It's the same electromagnet
as the murder weapon.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.644
Murder weapon? I thought you
guys were looking for poison.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.951
No. We have a new theory
we're working with.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.304
Uh, listen, can we...

30:28.304 --> 30:30.089
can we continue
this conversation

30:30.089 --> 30:31.873
in my office, please?
<i>We found this</i>

30:31.873 --> 30:33.701
at the party
you left early.

30:33.701 --> 30:34.963
This is where

30:34.963 --> 30:36.095
you tell us
you've never seen it before.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.270
Well, I haven't.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.749
If Joe Milligan
was here,

30:38.749 --> 30:40.577
do you think he'd
recognize this device?

30:40.577 --> 30:43.102
I mean, his company,
Whitmore Hewitt, was paying you

30:43.102 --> 30:44.364
a lot of money
for that weapon.

30:44.364 --> 30:45.278
No.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.888
And...

30:46.888 --> 30:48.977
Roland Woodall was
getting his beak wet, too.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.239
You didn't like
that, I guess.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.240
Whitmore Hewett

30:51.240 --> 30:53.895
bought my autoclave, okay?

30:53.895 --> 30:55.288
But...

30:55.288 --> 30:57.856
Yes, it-it uses
similar technology.

30:57.856 --> 31:02.773
But all my device does
is sterilize surgical equipment.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.950
- I can show you the prototype.
- Luther,

31:04.950 --> 31:06.429
come on.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.040
Sure. We can look
at the prototypes.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.172
My colleagues
- would appreciate that.
- L-Look,

31:10.172 --> 31:11.870
I-I'm sure
that once

31:11.870 --> 31:13.306
you've seen it
for yourself,

31:13.306 --> 31:15.699
you will realize
I have nothing to do with this.

31:15.699 --> 31:18.267
Listen, Professor,
let's not get off-subject here.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.878
You're gonna tell me
you didn't know

31:19.878 --> 31:21.183
a defense contractor

31:21.183 --> 31:22.706
would weaponize the tech
you were selling?

31:22.706 --> 31:24.273
I don't have to take this.

31:24.273 --> 31:25.622
No, Professor.

31:25.622 --> 31:26.885
You don't.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.712
Thank you for
your time, sir.

31:29.757 --> 31:30.932
I had that guy
on the ropes.

31:30.932 --> 31:31.977
No, you did not.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.282
He's notour guy.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.154
When people have
neurological damage,

31:35.154 --> 31:37.330
they typically walk
with a hemiplegic gait.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.027
All the survivors
at the party did.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.464
<i>Paralysis, weakness, spasticity.</i>

31:41.464 --> 31:43.466
<i>When it's on one side
of the body,</i>

31:43.466 --> 31:45.251
<i>it decreases motor function,</i>

31:45.251 --> 31:47.862
<i>and then it alters the range
of motion at the joint.</i>

31:47.862 --> 31:50.430
<i>Take Luther. At the hospital,
he was ambulatory,</i>

31:50.430 --> 31:51.822
<i>but his knee was hyperextended,</i>

31:51.822 --> 31:54.129
<i>so his steps were abducted</i>

31:54.129 --> 31:56.349
<i>and it swung in a semicircle.</i>

31:56.349 --> 31:58.786
Today, Luther's performance
was not as good.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.875
<i>He snuck one by me before,</i>

32:00.875 --> 32:02.964
<i>'cause he was walking around
with that IV stand.</i>

32:02.964 --> 32:05.010
<i>But today he was freestyling,</i>

32:05.010 --> 32:08.230
<i>moving slow but with a totally
normal range of motion.</i>

32:08.230 --> 32:09.840
<i>So no sale.</i>

32:09.840 --> 32:11.973
Why would Luther
fake his symptoms?

32:11.973 --> 32:14.454
I can think of one reason.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.282
He's the killer.

32:25.378 --> 32:26.770
If Luther built
this thing,

32:26.770 --> 32:28.642
doesn't look like
he left any prints.

32:28.642 --> 32:31.558
Our boss, how solid is she
with all this kinesiology stuff?

32:31.558 --> 32:34.300
The next time Max is wrong
about gait analysis

32:34.300 --> 32:36.867
will be the first time Max
is wrong about gait analysis.

32:36.867 --> 32:38.695
But...

32:38.695 --> 32:40.349
you think this case
- could make history?
- I don't know.

32:40.349 --> 32:41.437
If I'm honest,

32:41.437 --> 32:43.048
I hope Max missed on this one.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.745
I like Luther.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.965
I mean, I know we're not
supposed to root for anybody,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.444
but... Hey, hey.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.011
Nobody can tell you
what feelings to have.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.013
Thanks. One of my daughter's
favorite bedtime stories

32:52.013 --> 32:53.536
has that message.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.321
It's about a princess
who happens to be a zucchini.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.150
Well... I'm serious, Beau.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.716
You know, when you
get out of the lab,

32:59.716 --> 33:01.544
there's a
human element.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.633
When we point fingers,

33:03.633 --> 33:06.114
people lose their freedom.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.202
It's heavy.

33:07.202 --> 33:10.205
My best advice--

33:10.205 --> 33:12.381
let the evidence do
the pointing for you.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.428
Damn it.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.299
<i>I think it's gonna point
to whoever did this welding.</i>

33:17.299 --> 33:18.605
<i>Luther?</i>

33:18.605 --> 33:21.129
IXRF Atlas will show
if the alloy matches

33:21.129 --> 33:22.739
the welding metals
in his clothes.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.002
I took 'em from the hospital.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.873
Who knows?

33:25.873 --> 33:27.266
Rumor has it Max is human.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.007
Maybe she got it
wrong this time.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.487
Right.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.585
How long have we known
each other, Catherine?

33:42.585 --> 33:44.587
Long enough to know
you don't want be here.

33:44.587 --> 33:46.415
I told you-- I'm afraid.

33:46.415 --> 33:49.157
I have a person of interest
in Grace's disappearance.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.551
A man who tried
to buy her silence.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.466
Mikel Koslov.

33:53.466 --> 33:54.467
You know him?

33:54.467 --> 33:56.077
The name.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.514
We hosted him at the Eclipse
a dozen times.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.909
He likes craps, cards and girls.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.128
Not in that order.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.868
He's definitely
scary, but...

34:04.868 --> 34:06.131
why do you think it's him?

34:07.175 --> 34:09.569
How much you want to know
about capillary electrophoresis?

34:09.569 --> 34:11.919
You gonna help me
or not?

34:13.486 --> 34:14.965
I don't think I can.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.967
Koslov is gone.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.578
He hopped on his private jet yesterday.

34:18.578 --> 34:19.666
Where'd he go?

34:21.146 --> 34:23.104
You should stop.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.541
Just take this as a
sign that it's over.

34:25.541 --> 34:26.890
Let it go.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.938
How long
have we been friends, Jodi?

34:34.420 --> 34:37.075
I was told that I could help you
with some technical questions.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.033
Got all kinds
of questions, Mr. Cannel.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.904
First one is...

34:40.904 --> 34:42.254
ever seen one of these?

34:42.254 --> 34:44.517
Uh, that's
computational tomography.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.779
It's a CAT scan.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.737
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. It is your CAT scan

34:47.737 --> 34:49.609
taken at the hospital
the other day.

34:49.609 --> 34:50.914
How did you get...

34:50.914 --> 34:51.872
We had a warrant.

34:51.872 --> 34:52.960
Does it look
like there's

34:52.960 --> 34:54.527
anything missing there
to you?

34:54.527 --> 34:56.268
- No.
- You are right.

34:56.268 --> 34:57.921
That is
your big old brain,

34:57.921 --> 34:59.314
all right there.

34:59.314 --> 35:02.012
But I will tell you
what is not there.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.972
Is the distributed infarctions

35:04.972 --> 35:06.974
that all the
other victims had.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.542
So you think I was exposed
to less of whatever did this?

35:09.542 --> 35:12.545
Mm. Don't think you
were exposed at all.

35:12.545 --> 35:15.156
Hey, Beau?
We're ready for you.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.900
See, most

35:19.900 --> 35:22.294
of our questions have
to do with this thing.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.078
We found it at the
party the other night.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.340
Yeah, we're hoping

35:25.340 --> 35:27.473
that a brilliant engineer
like yourself

35:27.473 --> 35:29.170
can answer some questions,
like, uh,

35:29.170 --> 35:30.867
how it works
or-or who made it.

35:30.867 --> 35:31.999
Or, you know, we're
not even completely sure

35:31.999 --> 35:33.348
how to turn it on.

35:33.348 --> 35:34.915
I really wouldn't do that
if I were you.

35:34.915 --> 35:37.004
Well, I think
this charges it up.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.832
Uh, but exactly
how showtime happens, that,

35:38.832 --> 35:40.486
I don't know. I mean, it's
got to be, like, a knob here...

35:40.486 --> 35:43.315
Mr. Finado, please, do not
play with that in here!

35:43.315 --> 35:44.881
You're-you're a scientist.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.535
You understand how
dangerous this is, right?

35:46.535 --> 35:48.146
Luther?

35:49.756 --> 35:51.758
You killed three people.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.716
I'm not your peer.
I'm not your friend.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.414
I know my rights.
And we know

35:55.414 --> 35:56.632
you made that weapon.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.199
<i>The welding metals</i>

35:58.199 --> 35:59.200
<i>in the fibers of your socks</i>

35:59.200 --> 36:00.549
<i>are the exact same</i>

36:00.549 --> 36:02.769
welding metals in that.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.249
Okay, just please
turn it off.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.033
Please turn it off, okay?!

36:06.033 --> 36:07.382
Woodall made a deal
behind your back.

36:07.382 --> 36:08.470
You found out
they were gonna take your tech

36:08.470 --> 36:09.471
and make a weapon.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.169
So you had
to stop them.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.345
<i>You found the perfect place
to set it up.</i>

36:13.345 --> 36:14.694
Pool enclosure.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.435
Gave you a power source
and cover.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.045
<i>And then you waited</i>

36:18.045 --> 36:19.481
<i>until Woodall was standing
in the beam</i>

36:19.481 --> 36:21.179
<i>and then you let him have it.</i>

36:22.441 --> 36:25.008
<i>Then you blended in
with the survivors.</i>

36:25.008 --> 36:27.576
I didn't mean to
hurt those people.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.144
- Then why'd you do it?
- Because I had to.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.885
That party was our last chance.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.931
Somebody had to stop Woodall
from making that deal!

36:34.931 --> 36:38.065
Relax, Luther.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.109
I removed it.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.415
Your contribution, right?

36:40.415 --> 36:42.069
The power pack?

36:42.069 --> 36:45.594
Whitmore Hewitt never
cared about our autoclave

36:45.594 --> 36:47.901
or how many lives
it could save.

36:47.901 --> 36:51.818
They wanted my pulse power
generator that came with it.

36:51.818 --> 36:55.256
Wall outlet electricity
converted into pulses

36:55.256 --> 36:57.998
of narrow-band
high-voltage power.

36:57.998 --> 37:01.088
When I realized what they
intended to do with it, I...

37:01.088 --> 37:03.046
You went the full Oppenheimer, huh?

37:03.046 --> 37:04.352
"I am become Death,

37:04.352 --> 37:06.136
destroyer of worlds."

37:08.269 --> 37:09.618
Thomas "Beau" Finado,

37:09.618 --> 37:11.403
you're the man
who synthesized

37:11.403 --> 37:14.188
cleaner-burning jet
fuel using glycerol

37:14.188 --> 37:15.494
and butyl alcohol, right?

37:15.494 --> 37:17.583
- You looked me up.
- That process,

37:17.583 --> 37:20.934
did it decrease pollution
in commercial aircraft?

37:20.934 --> 37:24.981
Or did it just end up
making cheaper explosives?

37:26.200 --> 37:28.289
What's your body count,
Mr. Finado, huh?

37:30.117 --> 37:31.553
Detective,

37:31.553 --> 37:33.599
this man needs to be advised
of his rights.

37:33.599 --> 37:34.948
Get up for me, please.

37:36.732 --> 37:37.690
Hands behind
your back.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.693
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.521
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

37:42.521 --> 37:43.870
in a court of law.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.219
You have the right
to an attorney.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.525
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

37:46.525 --> 37:48.353
one will be
provided for you.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.485
He's right, you know.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.052
At the end
of the day,

37:52.052 --> 37:53.923
he might've done us a favor.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.925
You do not believe that.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.363
It's not up to us

37:58.363 --> 38:01.235
to decide what ought to be.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.845
Our job

38:02.845 --> 38:05.021
is to find out what happened.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.938
You did your job today, Beau.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.555
♪ You're so fly with it

38:16.555 --> 38:19.819
♪ 'Cause you just get it...

38:19.819 --> 38:21.473
I have to admit,

38:21.473 --> 38:23.257
I'm surprised
you offered to meet here.

38:24.737 --> 38:27.609
It's not true what they say--
"You can't go home again."

38:28.610 --> 38:30.351
I used to work at
a club like this.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.961
You're kidding.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.748
Life is long, Monica.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.358
If you keep your head up,

38:37.358 --> 38:39.404
you'll have a lot more
luck finding your path.

38:41.231 --> 38:42.885
Anyways, uh,

38:42.885 --> 38:44.278
stuff I gave you,

38:44.278 --> 38:46.062
did it help?

38:46.062 --> 38:47.673
Oh, yeah.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.849
You gave us a great lead.

38:51.241 --> 38:54.027
A certain... smoker

38:54.027 --> 38:56.159
is hiding in Belarus.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.378
Mikel.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.337
He's the one
who gave Grace the watch?

39:00.990 --> 39:03.210
She knew something he was
trying to keep quiet.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.213
Something that got her killed.

39:07.257 --> 39:09.216
Do you think you'll
ever find out what happened?

39:10.609 --> 39:12.567
Keep my number in
your phone, Monica.

39:12.567 --> 39:13.916
Might take a while.

39:14.917 --> 39:17.703
But you'll hear from me.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.618
♪ That's what you are.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.017
So, have you ever been
to Belarus before?

39:28.017 --> 39:30.846
No. I hear it's pretty
blah this time of year.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.067
It's where the answers are, Max.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.243
If you need anything
while you're on this Mikel guy,

39:36.243 --> 39:37.462
you call us, okay?

39:37.462 --> 39:39.028
I will.

39:41.466 --> 39:42.989
Watch your back.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.426
Yeah.

39:51.127 --> 39:52.433
Everything all right?

39:52.433 --> 39:54.435
I got some
of my least favorite people

39:54.435 --> 39:56.132
stomping
all through my house.

39:56.132 --> 39:59.266
Did they at least say thank you
for solving "their" case?

40:00.223 --> 40:01.573
Hmm.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.794
I...
meant you, Max.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.709
Are <i>you</i> doing all right?

40:09.145 --> 40:11.409
Since you
got back...

40:12.453 --> 40:13.759
Go on.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.196
Speak your mind.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.766
You seem anxious.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.202
Snapping at Beau.

40:22.202 --> 40:24.378
Second-guessing
every safety precaution.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.423
It is my job to keep us safe.

40:25.423 --> 40:29.470
I thought maybe getting attacked

40:29.470 --> 40:30.558
got into your head.

40:32.908 --> 40:36.782
When my grandfather
taught me how to ride a bike,

40:36.782 --> 40:41.308
he said, "You have no choice
but to move forward."

40:41.308 --> 40:44.442
If you do that while looking
over your shoulder,

40:44.442 --> 40:46.008
you crash.

40:46.008 --> 40:47.967
So if it's not some old lady
hitting me in the head

40:47.967 --> 40:49.795
with a tire iron,
it's something else?

40:49.795 --> 40:52.972
It's up to you to decide
how much of yesterday

40:52.972 --> 40:55.017
you want to drag into today.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.629
And how much power

40:57.629 --> 40:59.457
you're willing to give it.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.199
It wasn't my grandfather
who taught me that.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.516
Sorry for the intrusion,
Dr. Roby. It's nothing personal.

41:15.516 --> 41:18.519
Just some folks in D.C.
that want to put this to bed.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.000
And make sure
that <i>that</i>

41:21.000 --> 41:23.350
gets to where it needs to go.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.526
Agent Fenwick, I'm sure you
folks will do a super job

41:25.526 --> 41:27.136
at delivering the mail.

41:28.094 --> 41:29.748
And you're welcome.

41:32.446 --> 41:34.230
All right, people.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.928
Be careful
with that.

41:38.278 --> 41:41.324
I know it's not up to us to
decide how things ought to be,

41:41.324 --> 41:43.762
but should I have told
'em that I have this?

41:43.762 --> 41:45.372
And without that...

41:45.372 --> 41:46.895
Agents of our government
are taking possession

41:46.895 --> 41:49.289
of a very expensive paperweight.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.468
Are you gonna
tell them?

42:00.213 --> 42:02.650
Go and get back to work.
