WEBVTT

00:04.122 --> 00:07.080
The train to the Museum of Natural
History should be here any...

00:07.164 --> 00:08.164
Forty-one seconds.

00:08.247 --> 00:10.372
Forty-one seconds from now, apparently.

00:10.456 --> 00:14.372
I'm really looking forward to seeing
some paleontology, archeology...

00:14.456 --> 00:16.206
All the ologies, really.

00:16.289 --> 00:18.664
Milo, you're an ology unto yourself.

00:18.748 --> 00:20.206
Oh! Forgot my student discount.

00:20.289 --> 00:22.206
-[beeps]
-Thanks, Amanda.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.206
Melissa, is there ever a time
you haven't forgotten something?

00:24.289 --> 00:26.664
Yeah, February 30th or 31st...
I forget.

00:26.748 --> 00:28.664
Neither of those are dates.

00:28.748 --> 00:32.872
I'll be giving a tour for anyone who's
not going to be at the "Milo Show".

00:32.955 --> 00:34.830
Bradley, I don't have
a performance planned.

00:34.914 --> 00:38.122
Sure, you say that now, but then
one geyser comes through the floor,

00:38.206 --> 00:40.289
and suddenly,
Milo's the center of attention.

00:40.372 --> 00:41.414
Oops! I'm stuck.

00:41.498 --> 00:43.498
-Cue geyser.
-[all laughing]

00:43.581 --> 00:45.206
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:45.289 --> 00:48.372
Interesting tidbit about the Museum
of Natural History, it was...

00:48.456 --> 00:50.122
Shh! We're watching Milo in the turnstile.

00:50.206 --> 00:52.414
It's like he's on Cirque du Subway.

00:52.498 --> 00:53.539
[yells]

00:53.623 --> 00:55.289
Should we wait for the next one?

00:55.372 --> 00:58.206
Nah, he's got it. In three, two, one...

00:58.789 --> 01:01.748
[yelling]

01:01.830 --> 01:04.080
This floor is a lot
cleaner than I expected.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.872
[man on PA] Next stop,
the Museum of Natural History.

01:06.955 --> 01:09.872
-So, this is the subway?
-You've never been on it?

01:09.955 --> 01:12.706
It's dark and dirty and
full of weird smells.

01:12.789 --> 01:14.331
That was their ad campaign last year.

01:14.414 --> 01:16.164
[wind howling in distance]

01:16.247 --> 01:18.872
Hey, you guys ever hear
about those mole people?

01:18.955 --> 01:20.247
-[nervously] No.
-The urban legend?

01:20.331 --> 01:22.789
A subspecies of humanish creatures

01:22.872 --> 01:25.164
roaming the tunnels searching for prey.

01:25.247 --> 01:26.331
Maybe we'll meet some.

01:26.414 --> 01:28.122
Rather meet them aboveground.

01:28.206 --> 01:30.414
Then they wouldn't be mole
people, they'd be...

01:30.498 --> 01:31.581
People.

01:31.664 --> 01:33.830
-[thudding]
-Does it usually do this?

01:33.914 --> 01:36.289
Well, sometimes.
When the coupling's loose.

01:36.372 --> 01:38.623
[Zack] The coupling's loose?
What does that even mean?

01:38.706 --> 01:40.122
I better put on my seat belt.

01:40.206 --> 01:41.372
How's that going to work?

01:41.456 --> 01:43.456
Easy, you insert the tab into the buckle

01:43.539 --> 01:45.289
until you hear a click. Like this.

01:47.372 --> 01:48.830
[both grunt]

01:48.914 --> 01:50.289
Oh, I get it now.

01:50.372 --> 01:53.289
I would've had extras, but you
know, the llama incident.

01:53.372 --> 01:57.914
And so, that's when the planetarium
removed Pluto from the cosmo show.

01:57.997 --> 02:00.456
Man, Pluto has to be a planet.

02:00.539 --> 02:02.997
An astrologer told me
it's in my fourth house.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.498
-No, Pluto...
-[thudding]

02:04.581 --> 02:07.206
The other car came off! Milo's in there.

02:07.289 --> 02:09.289
Of course he is.

02:09.372 --> 02:11.830
So, that's what a runaway
train car looks like.

02:13.539 --> 02:16.080
I'll be honest,
I'm a little disappointed.

02:20.581 --> 02:22.955
[Zack yelling]

02:23.039 --> 02:25.789
-[rumbling]
-[screaming]

02:25.872 --> 02:27.539
Well, at least we're
aboveground. [chuckles]

02:27.623 --> 02:29.039
[yelling]

02:30.706 --> 02:32.872
[Zack and Melissa yelling]

02:40.331 --> 02:41.539
[bats screeching]

02:47.414 --> 02:49.039
[both screaming]

02:52.289 --> 02:54.414
[Milo] And then to unbuckle it,
you press down this button.

02:54.498 --> 02:55.331
[clicks]

02:55.414 --> 02:57.539
-[exhales]
-Locked. How can these be locked?

02:57.623 --> 02:58.997
Does it usually do this?

02:59.080 --> 03:00.914
[grunts] The windows don't open either.

03:00.997 --> 03:02.997
What is the point of a
window that doesn't open?

03:03.080 --> 03:04.539
It provides work for window washers

03:04.623 --> 03:06.664
and glass installation professionals.

03:06.748 --> 03:09.372
And the ceiling.
Is there usually a ceiling?

03:10.456 --> 03:13.372
[breathing heavily]

03:13.456 --> 03:14.706
Zack, are you by chance claustro...

03:14.789 --> 03:17.997
Not claustrophobic.
Just claustro-avoidant.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.372
I avoid enclosed places when possible.

03:20.456 --> 03:21.872
Probably not possible right now.

03:21.955 --> 03:23.456
It's better if I'm distracted.

03:23.539 --> 03:26.080
Okay, wait.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.164
-Not helping.
-How about this?

03:29.664 --> 03:31.289
[accordion playing]

03:35.289 --> 03:38.414
Now I'm distracted. Have you been
carrying that the whole time?

03:38.498 --> 03:40.414
I try to pack for any eventuality.

03:40.498 --> 03:42.623
Now let's see about
getting those doors open.

03:42.706 --> 03:44.039
Ah, here we go.

03:44.122 --> 03:46.789
Okay, next time, key
first, tap dancing later.

03:49.247 --> 03:50.581
This is amazing.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.581
Look! A fossil!

03:52.664 --> 03:55.581
Chicken wing. Circa 1993.

03:55.664 --> 03:58.331
See? Nothing can live under here!
Not even chickens.

03:58.414 --> 03:59.581
Could be worse. How?

03:59.664 --> 04:01.331
Mysterious underground creatures?

04:01.414 --> 04:03.247
I guess that would be worse.

04:03.331 --> 04:06.331
No, mysterious underground
creatures are coming towards us.

04:11.498 --> 04:14.039
Silver lining, things can live down here.

04:14.122 --> 04:16.872
-[man] Someone hit the lights.
-[clicks]

04:16.955 --> 04:19.289
Well, I'll be honest.
I'm a little disappointed.

04:19.372 --> 04:22.206
Young people from the overland.

04:22.289 --> 04:24.623
You shall be our leaders!

04:24.706 --> 04:27.623
No, no, we have a leader. It's Dave. 'Sup?

04:27.706 --> 04:29.914
It's a democratic hierarchical society.

04:29.997 --> 04:31.456
Wait a minute. Who are you guys?

04:31.539 --> 04:36.122
We live below.
The call us the "Belownies."

04:36.206 --> 04:38.539
No, they don't, Scott. We voted on this.

04:38.623 --> 04:40.456
"Belownies" sounds like a lunch meat.

04:40.539 --> 04:41.623
We're called the Undergrounders.

04:41.706 --> 04:44.498
I am the wise healer among my peoples.

04:44.581 --> 04:45.664
He is a pipe fitter.

04:45.748 --> 04:46.789
Where are we?

04:46.872 --> 04:49.414
We call our world Subterranus.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.080
[softly] Terranus, terranus...

04:52.164 --> 04:55.080
That one's true.
He just wanted it so badly.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.498
I wore them down.

04:56.581 --> 04:58.372
So, where you kids headed?

04:58.456 --> 05:00.997
Class trip to the museum.
I helped organize it.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.955
He shall be our leader.

05:03.039 --> 05:04.789
How long have you been down here?

05:04.872 --> 05:07.122
Since the before times.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.955
Uh, about a month, actually.

05:09.039 --> 05:11.955
We were building an extension
on this line but we got lost,

05:12.039 --> 05:14.581
so we figured we'd better
establish a new civilization.

05:14.664 --> 05:18.664
Wow! You established a new
civilization in a month?

05:18.748 --> 05:20.664
You'd be surprised how
much you can get done

05:20.748 --> 05:22.789
when you're not constantly setting
up and moving orange cones.

05:22.872 --> 05:25.498
I shall be the leader!

05:25.581 --> 05:26.789
Seriously, Scott.

05:31.789 --> 05:35.872
So, you've got agriculture,
art, rudimentary government...

05:35.955 --> 05:37.539
Licorice, somehow.

05:37.623 --> 05:39.331
You're actually going to eat that?

05:39.414 --> 05:42.247
I'm trying to distract myself
from the walls moving in on us.

05:42.331 --> 05:44.080
I wonder what part of the chicken is this?

05:45.080 --> 05:46.706
The rat part.

05:46.789 --> 05:49.289
Granola bars?

05:49.372 --> 05:53.414
Oh. He bears the sweet
manna of the overland!

05:53.498 --> 05:57.539
Oh, no thanks. I just had some
"chicken" and kinda lost my appetite.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.581
-[sniffing]
-Diogee? What are you doing here?

06:00.664 --> 06:02.080
Please be rescuing us.

06:02.164 --> 06:04.539
The floppy-eared one shall be our leader.

06:04.623 --> 06:05.872
Weren't you allergic to dogs?

06:05.955 --> 06:08.997
Right, you know what?
Yeah, yeah, I actually am.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.581
Wait, Diogee, our leader.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.247
We are not starting our own civilization.

06:14.331 --> 06:15.830
They taste worse than they smell.

06:15.914 --> 06:18.414
Diogee always knows the way home.

06:18.498 --> 06:20.623
Diogee, go home!

06:20.706 --> 06:22.748
[all cheering]

06:22.830 --> 06:24.080
[man] I enjoy running.

06:28.581 --> 06:29.581
[grunts]

06:31.289 --> 06:32.748
[rumbling]

06:32.830 --> 06:34.498
[both yelling]

06:36.830 --> 06:39.289
No! Melissa! Milo!

06:40.706 --> 06:42.206
[Zack] Are you guys okay?

06:42.289 --> 06:44.623
Yeah, we're okay,
if you call being buried alive okay.

06:44.706 --> 06:47.872
I see light pass this one rock.
Maybe if we can move...

06:47.955 --> 06:50.414
[grunts] No, no, it won't budge.

06:50.498 --> 06:53.664
Don't worry. I've got my backpack right...

06:53.748 --> 06:55.456
What was that?

06:55.539 --> 06:59.122
Hmm. Well, okay,
maybe you can worry a little bit.

07:00.706 --> 07:02.914
[gasps] Oh, dear. 13, 14, 15...

07:02.997 --> 07:05.581
Oh! I could swear we had 18 kids.

07:05.664 --> 07:07.289
Can you read my writing?

07:07.372 --> 07:08.706
Is that a five or an eight?

07:08.789 --> 07:10.830
Any minute now,
Milo is going to show up

07:10.914 --> 07:12.289
and everybody is going to be like,

07:12.372 --> 07:14.664
"Oh, Milo, tell us about your adventure."

07:14.748 --> 07:16.914
But until then,
I'm having my best day ever.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.955
Mort, do you really
need more rose quartz?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.789
If you understood its properties,

07:20.872 --> 07:22.623
you wouldn't be asking me that.

07:23.872 --> 07:25.789
Okay, here's the plan.

07:25.872 --> 07:29.830
Someone crawl though and jimmy
out that rock from the front.

07:29.914 --> 07:31.623
I don't think any of us can fit.

07:32.206 --> 07:33.914
I can fit, I think.

07:33.997 --> 07:35.456
But, Zack, you're claustro-avoidant.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.914
Are you sure you wanna do this?

07:36.997 --> 07:39.289
No, I'm sure I don't wanna do it.

07:39.372 --> 07:41.247
-But you guys need me.
-[man] Good luck, kid.

07:41.331 --> 07:42.623
[Scott] It was nice knowing you.

07:42.706 --> 07:44.623
-Hey, that was my flashlight.
-[man] Scott...

07:44.706 --> 07:46.456
[Scott]: But he's gonna
use up the batteries.

07:46.539 --> 07:48.414
-Is there another flashlight in there?
-[Scott] See?

07:48.498 --> 07:50.539
My backup "backup" got crushed.

07:50.623 --> 07:52.122
I can barely see.

07:52.206 --> 07:56.539
Not much to see, just kind of
a tiny enclosed suffocating...

07:56.623 --> 07:58.289
You know what? Never mind.

07:58.372 --> 08:00.498
You can do this.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.706
Think of how you faced down wolves
and survived an alien abduction.

08:03.789 --> 08:05.414
And that's just since we've met.

08:05.498 --> 08:07.664
I'm sure you did lots
of stuff before that.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.372
Nope, never did anything.

08:12.372 --> 08:14.289
What if this rock is all
that's holding this up?

08:14.372 --> 08:15.955
Don't worry. I'm sure it'll all work out.

08:16.039 --> 08:17.456
How do you know?

08:17.539 --> 08:20.664
-Because it has so far.
-Relatively speaking.

08:20.748 --> 08:22.331
Okay, on three.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.914
One, two, three!

08:26.914 --> 08:29.164
It's clear! Yeah! Yeah!

08:29.247 --> 08:30.872
See? I told you it would hold.

08:38.706 --> 08:40.247
Well, it held long enough.

08:40.331 --> 08:41.748
You totally saved us.

08:41.830 --> 08:44.039
He shall be our leader.

08:44.122 --> 08:46.206
-[both] Yeah, he shall.
-Thanks, guys.

08:46.289 --> 08:47.748
I am impressed, kid.

08:47.830 --> 08:50.539
I would've just let them
start a new society in there.

08:50.623 --> 08:52.414
Hey, where's Diogee? [barks]

08:55.789 --> 08:57.080
-[all] Diogee!
-[barks]

09:05.122 --> 09:07.872
You know, we have no idea
where these tracks go.

09:07.955 --> 09:09.331
I'm sure it'll all work out.

09:09.414 --> 09:12.664
-You're sure?
-He uses that term loosely.

09:12.748 --> 09:13.955
[Milo] Uh-oh.

09:14.706 --> 09:15.830
I got this.

09:16.914 --> 09:18.789
Ooh.

09:18.872 --> 09:19.914
Or not.

09:19.997 --> 09:22.122
[all screaming]

09:25.122 --> 09:26.623
Oh, we survived.

09:26.706 --> 09:28.080
Uh-oh. Maybe not.

09:28.164 --> 09:31.372
[Scott] Oh, come on.

09:31.456 --> 09:34.456
Yeah, I guess, maybe if you
squint, it could be a five.

09:36.748 --> 09:38.623
[students exclaiming]

09:38.706 --> 09:40.706
Nope, it was an eight.
[chuckles]

09:40.789 --> 09:43.039
Milo, tell us about your adventure.

09:43.122 --> 09:44.830
And we're back.

09:44.914 --> 09:46.164
What will you guys do now?

09:46.206 --> 09:48.830
There is no place in
your world for us now.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.623
Then you can stay, Scott.

09:50.706 --> 09:52.414
Me, I'm gonna go check my DVR.

09:52.498 --> 09:54.830
I've got a month of the Doctor
Zone Files to catch up on.

09:54.914 --> 09:56.539
Oh, that means you missed
it when the trash...

09:56.623 --> 09:57.789
No spoilers.

09:57.872 --> 10:00.664
[all saying goodbye]

10:00.748 --> 10:03.164
I shall return to Subterranus.
