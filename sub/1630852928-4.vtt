WEBVTT

00:35.326 --> 00:36.244
Retreat!

00:37.787 --> 00:38.997
Fall back!

00:49.883 --> 00:51.885


00:54.888 --> 00:56.264
Your plan won't work.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.059
The bridge has now
been fortified with armed towers.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.979
If we attempt to storm the gates,
as you suggest,

01:03.521 --> 01:05.398
we will lose a thousand men
before we reach it.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.361
Then we raid England
till it runs out of food.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.866
They're prepared for that.
They appear well stocked for such a siege.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.535
We will run out of men
long before they run out of food.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.829
What do you suggest?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.290
Forget about taking London.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.334
What are you talking about?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.961
-London is the key to taking England.
-No.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.048
Edmund is the key.

01:32.175 --> 01:35.220
Take England's king, you take England.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.268
Let me hear your plan.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.647
It is the Greenlander's plan.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.360
Think of the bridge like a boat.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.364
Its main arch is its keel,
built to withstand the great weight.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.658
But the English have weakened it.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.910
Why would they do that?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.370
It wasn't intentional.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.874
They put a drawbridge in the middle,

02:06.543 --> 02:09.462
and in doing so,
they've made it vulnerable.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141


02:31.609 --> 02:34.362
If we are to succeed,
our timing is crucial.

02:35.989 --> 02:41.077
If you are not in the right position
when the tide turns, nothing will work.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.289
Do you understand
what you're asking?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.584
Even if I put
my strongest man in my best boat,

02:47.667 --> 02:49.878
it would be impossible

02:49.961 --> 02:53.214
to hold it against that current
and out of range of their archers.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.260
I'm not asking for your best boat.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.055
I'm asking for your best three boats.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.602
You're crazy.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.770
And you're afraid of failure.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.439
I'm afraid of stupidity.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.650
His plan is ridiculous. It cannot be done.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.652
I did not say it would be easy.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.072
That is why they won't expect it.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.541
We look for another way.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.514
Make way! Make way for the King!

03:48.061 --> 03:49.812
Hail King Edmund!

03:58.947 --> 04:00.073
King Edmund.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.409
Congratulations on your coronation.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.328
Thank you, Ealdorman Streona.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.874
May I present my stepmother. Queen Emma.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.876
Queen Emma.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.753
I'm sorry for your loss,

04:14.504 --> 04:16.714
your husband was a great warrior.
He is missed.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.217
Thank you, Ealdorman Streona.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.552
He would be pleased
that you obeyed his call

04:21.636 --> 04:23.429
and have come to England's aid.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.140
I am your servant.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.230
The Vikings are camped
on the other side of the Southwark Island.

04:33.022 --> 04:33.856
Why the south?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.359
His spies have undoubtedly
told him that you're here

04:36.442 --> 04:38.903
to protect London
from an attack from the north.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.281
But now that that is established,

04:41.364 --> 04:42.699
I want you to move,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.494
cross the Thames below his fleet

04:46.577 --> 04:48.329
and bring your army to his rear.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.456
Trapping him between
the river and the swamp.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.374
Exactly.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.627
You came up with this plan?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.880
Yes. Why?

05:01.926 --> 05:03.886
Because it is excellent, Your Highness.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.057
And where will you be
while Mercia attacks the Northmen?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.726
Inside the walls of London?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.185
Where he is most valuable

05:11.936 --> 05:15.023
and where he will remain until
Canute's defeat is being secured,

05:15.106 --> 05:18.109
which time he will ride out
and accept the Viking's surrender.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.945
I see. Mercia takes all the risks--

05:21.029 --> 05:22.572
And receives the glory.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.616
Your sacrifice
will not go unrewarded, Eadric Streona,

05:25.700 --> 05:28.119
but now is not the time to negotiate.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.912
On the contrary, Your Highness.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.623
With a Viking army
camped on your doorstep,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.043
I can't imagine a better time.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.003
And what is it you wish?

05:37.754 --> 05:39.881
Something far more tangible than glory.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.052
I wish for Mercia
to once again be independent.

05:44.135 --> 05:47.055
-As in the old days before your father.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.142
Then I suggest
you gather your army and leave.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.980
For if you believe that Canute will not
come for Mercia after taking London,

05:56.814 --> 05:58.483
then you're more naive than I thought.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.574
Prepare the men to return to Mercia.

06:08.993 --> 06:09.827
Wait.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.458
Perhaps we can come
to some other arrangement.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.711
Such as doubling Mercia's lands.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.008
Will these additional lands come
from your holdings, Your Highness?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.094
Perhaps.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.390
Maybe others will be forced to contribute,
but the increase is assured.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.059
You have my promise.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.695
You've guaranteed
a great victory, Your Highness.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.185
I thought your plan was good.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.773
Just not good enough?

07:24.318 --> 07:26.946
And you are asking me to risk 10,000 lives

07:28.406 --> 07:29.699
on the actions of six.

07:31.367 --> 07:34.996
To do that
I must be convinced that it will succeed.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.417
Olaf is a great warrior.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.962
Knows the English defenses
better than anyone.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.632
And yet, here you are.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.970
Convince me, your plan will work.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.514
Why should I trust you?

07:56.767 --> 07:59.270
Because I do not care about your success.

08:03.065 --> 08:03.983
I care about them.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.613
They'd risk their lives for me.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.909
I was more concerned
about your role than ours.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.411
If you failed,

08:16.537 --> 08:18.956
everyone else's sacrifice
would count for nothing.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.542
I was not worried about that.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.548
I have been Edmund.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.636
The son of a great warrior king.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.308
I know what the weight
of a powerful father feels like.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.311
So do I.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.440
Even if my father was a <i>Skogarmaor.</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:48.903
Yes.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.322
I forgot.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.116
Your father was Erik Thorvaldsson.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.163
You also know the desire
to stand in your own light.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.917
All too well.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.470
So, Greenlander.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.391
How do you plan
to get through the marshes?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.104
Hmm?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.173
What the hell are these things?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.176
This is a new Viking ship.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.874
We've come a long way, my friends.

11:09.251 --> 11:13.297
And I'm fortunate. And grateful.

11:15.925 --> 11:20.429
We are blessed by the Gods,
who alone know our destinies.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.473
Hmm.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.059
If this is where we say goodbye on Earth,

11:25.768 --> 11:27.937
then it is only a quick farewell

11:29.522 --> 11:32.316
as we will hail
each other soon in Valhalla.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.734
Valhalla.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.487
In Valhalla.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.291
-May the Gods be with all of us.
-The Allfather watch us all.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.683
-When did you learn to shoot a bow?
-You taught me.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.353
Skarde.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.892
What do you think?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.229
It is like it was built by the Gods.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.859
No, not Gods. Just carpenters.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.657
Tarps.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.693
Formation!

18:38.951 --> 18:41.495
-Range?
-Still too far, my lady.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.790
Row!

18:46.458 --> 18:48.377
Row!

18:49.753 --> 18:51.213
Form a line!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.517
Attention!

19:04.977 --> 19:06.228
Raise the defenses.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.522
Raise the defenses!

19:11.024 --> 19:12.234
Heave!

19:25.205 --> 19:26.290
Hold!

19:40.220 --> 19:41.638
Why is he marking time?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.812
He's waiting for something.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.443
I hear drums.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.863
No. Shields.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.145
Hold!

20:51.875 --> 20:53.543
Hold it!

21:45.929 --> 21:47.472
Acknowledge a parley.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.571
What is he doing?

22:46.073 --> 22:47.699
He's coming to challenge you.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.411
Keep him occupied until Streona arrives.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.589
You must be the Boy King, Edmund.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.925
And you must be the leader of the Vikings

23:05.008 --> 23:08.220
we've been hearing
for days and smelling for a week.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.975
My name is King Canute

23:15.310 --> 23:21.650
and I have come to kill you for the crimes
your father committed against my people.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.819
Well, I hate to disappoint you,

23:24.486 --> 23:27.364
but it is you
who will pay the price for your crimes.

23:30.325 --> 23:35.831
Such brave words
from a boy hiding behind a wall.

23:37.958 --> 23:41.378
Where I come from,
we have a word for that.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.050
<i>Bleyða!</i>

23:47.134 --> 23:52.889
<i>Bleyða! Bleyða! Bleyða!</i>

24:01.314 --> 24:03.984
-And what does that mean?
-It means…

24:06.194 --> 24:07.404
coward!

24:09.281 --> 24:11.575
And it is your new title.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.786
King Bleyða!

24:14.870 --> 24:15.871
Archer.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.249
Hold!

24:23.837 --> 24:25.422
Don't give in to your passion.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.884
You must keep him in place
until Streona arrives.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.273
Why not come out like a Man King?

24:44.065 --> 24:45.609
And do battle with honor.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.818
Honor?

24:48.320 --> 24:51.281
What honor is there
in sweeping the field clear of a rabble,

24:51.364 --> 24:52.991
hungry only for Danegeld?

24:53.992 --> 24:56.786
You are no better
than the beggars at my gate.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.331
I must say, I…

25:00.165 --> 25:02.334
I am disappointed in your response.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.213
What has become of England?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.382
There used to be warriors here.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.345
Your father, for example.

25:13.428 --> 25:19.100
When I was your age, I saw King Æthelred
lead a hundred men against a thousand.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.063
How he must anguish in his grave

25:23.146 --> 25:27.317
knowing that he has
sired a mouse for a son.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.121
I will make you a challenge.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.583
Come down here and fight me man-to-man.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.085
King-to-king.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.671
Or if you wish,
bring whatever troops you chose

25:47.754 --> 25:51.299
and fight my men
on this magnificent bridge.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.717
If you are victorious,

25:53.468 --> 25:57.264
then we will know
that our quest was not endorsed by God.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.015
We will accept His decision

25:59.099 --> 26:02.018
and leave this land
without further bloodshed.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.272
But if you do not,

26:06.106 --> 26:09.192
I promise you all the world

26:09.276 --> 26:12.612
will know the truth about Edmund,

26:12.696 --> 26:14.906
son of Æthelred.

26:14.990 --> 26:19.703
How he sacrificed
the courage of his kingdom

26:19.786 --> 26:21.580
to hide his own fear,

26:21.663 --> 26:24.791
and they will join us in hailing,

26:25.709 --> 26:27.252
"King Bleyða,

26:29.212 --> 26:31.256
The Coward of London."

26:43.768 --> 26:44.894
<i>Bleyða!</i>

26:48.356 --> 26:50.692
-I am not a coward!

26:53.320 --> 26:54.863
Come back here!

26:56.364 --> 26:58.825
I order you!

27:08.001 --> 27:10.795
-Get me my horse!

27:15.592 --> 27:17.969
No, Your Highness.
It is not the time.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.805
I disagree. It is precisely the time.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.433
Edmund, he has baited you,
you must wait for Streona.

27:23.516 --> 27:26.436
No! Streona lost his moment,

27:26.519 --> 27:29.481
I will lead this fight
and the glory will be ours.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.737
Men of England!

27:35.820 --> 27:41.534
I mean to wipe this Viking scourge
from our shores! Who is with me?

27:41.618 --> 27:43.828
Yeah!

27:45.246 --> 27:46.206
Edmund, stop!

27:46.998 --> 27:49.334
-Open the gates!
-Open the gates!

28:00.470 --> 28:01.721
The tide is turning.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.729
Keep holding!

28:19.823 --> 28:21.324
Open the gates!

28:25.745 --> 28:26.746
Archers.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.014
Prepare the roofs!

28:46.808 --> 28:47.767
More water!

28:48.935 --> 28:50.812
-Attack!

29:00.238 --> 29:02.115
Shield wall!

29:06.494 --> 29:07.704
Hold!

29:14.669 --> 29:16.129
Hold!

29:18.548 --> 29:20.133
Hold!

29:57.921 --> 30:01.382
Now! Row forward!

30:01.466 --> 30:04.260
-Forward!

30:44.592 --> 30:46.261
Row!

31:12.871 --> 31:15.748
Retreat! Retreat!

31:20.253 --> 31:21.546
Retreat!

31:22.797 --> 31:25.967
-Retreat!
-Retreat!

31:26.050 --> 31:27.594
Retreat!

31:43.359 --> 31:44.569
Fall back!

31:44.652 --> 31:46.279
Fall back!

31:46.946 --> 31:50.617
They're retreating. After them!

31:53.536 --> 31:55.204
The King is winning ground.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.084
Maybe.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.381
Stop!

32:07.467 --> 32:09.552
Keep holding!

32:15.808 --> 32:18.019
Fall back!

32:24.108 --> 32:25.443
Bring him back.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.780
-Bring him back.
-Your Highness?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.365
It is a trap.

32:34.827 --> 32:38.873
-Ready the archers!
-Archers! Draw!

32:54.597 --> 32:56.391
Pull! Pull!

33:03.231 --> 33:05.400
Archers! Ships!

33:05.483 --> 33:06.985
-Loose!

33:21.457 --> 33:22.500
Tie it fast!

33:23.960 --> 33:25.628
Pull away!

33:28.381 --> 33:29.632
Harder!

33:30.466 --> 33:31.676
Row!

33:32.593 --> 33:36.014
For the love of God,
give me everything you've got!

33:37.724 --> 33:39.100
Row!

33:52.572 --> 33:55.491
Defend the bridge!

34:11.632 --> 34:13.885
Archers. Beneath the bridge.

34:13.968 --> 34:16.262
-Loose!

34:16.345 --> 34:17.513
-Tomas!

34:21.851 --> 34:22.685
Njal!

34:24.437 --> 34:25.271
Leif!

34:41.120 --> 34:43.873
Ready yourselves, men! This is it!

34:50.505 --> 34:51.839
Shield wall!

34:53.716 --> 34:57.053
-Shield wall!
-Shield wall!

35:04.393 --> 35:08.606
My lord, Edmund has taken the battle
to the Vikings…

35:08.689 --> 35:11.901
-He's what?
-They battle on the bridge.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.278
Double time!

35:14.362 --> 35:17.073
-Row harder!
-Pull!

35:17.156 --> 35:20.368
Together! Now! Row!

35:33.548 --> 35:34.715
Sire!

35:36.050 --> 35:38.553
-You must return before it falls.
-What falls?

35:39.345 --> 35:41.472
The bridge. They labor to
bring it down and trap you.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.761
Attack!

37:11.229 --> 37:12.688
-No, Skarde!

37:13.648 --> 37:14.732
-Skarde!

37:24.408 --> 37:25.493
Row!

37:35.461 --> 37:37.004
Row!

37:37.088 --> 37:38.089
Hold on!

37:41.050 --> 37:42.343
Hyah!

37:45.846 --> 37:47.098
Now!

37:47.181 --> 37:49.642
Raise the sails!

37:54.063 --> 37:56.232
Row! Row!

38:22.133 --> 38:25.469
Yeah! Yeah!

38:26.762 --> 38:30.474
-We did it! Yeah!
-The Greenlanders!

38:30.558 --> 38:32.310
Greenlanders!

38:46.574 --> 38:48.409
Yes! Yes!

38:49.243 --> 38:52.788
Yeah! Yeah!

39:22.985 --> 39:23.903
Halt!

39:27.031 --> 39:29.742
Sir, we can still attack.

39:32.870 --> 39:33.746
No.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.875
He wanted glory, now let him taste defeat.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.962
I will not sacrifice good men
to a failed battle.

39:43.756 --> 39:46.384
Especially when there's
a greater victory to be gained.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.436
-Forward!
-Forward!

40:11.242 --> 40:13.035
Bring me the Boy King.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.960
Bring me England.

40:39.728 --> 40:40.604
Leif!

40:43.190 --> 40:44.024
You did it!

40:48.362 --> 40:49.572
This is for you!

40:50.072 --> 40:53.159
Your plan worked! We did it!

40:53.868 --> 40:55.578
Hail the Greenlander!

40:56.162 --> 41:00.082
Hail the Greenlander! Yes!

41:00.166 --> 41:02.084
Hail the Greenlander!

41:03.252 --> 41:05.713
-Hail the Greenlander!
