00:06.047 --> 00:07.674
[electronic dance music playing]

00:13.596 --> 00:15.348
Mission two, Robot?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.267
Two foot by one foot.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.311
-[Menuka] Base modular kit.
-[Taylor] Protect a jelly-cream dessert.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.897
[Renee] A 550-square-foot obstacle course.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.818
[Randi] And it needs to do speed,
stability, agility. Shock absorption?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.486
-Let's do it.
-All right. [laughing]

00:28.570 --> 00:31.656
-No. No high five.
-Oh, I missed it, I missed it.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.868
[electronic music playing]

00:39.581 --> 00:42.709
Oh, hello again, humanoids.
Welcome back to Baking Impossible.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.211
Our bakineers are
already into their next mission,

00:45.295 --> 00:47.630
baking and building incredibly awesome,

00:47.714 --> 00:51.217
incredibly adorable,
functional and delicious robots,

00:51.301 --> 00:52.802
like my buddy who brought a treat

00:52.886 --> 00:55.430
because he doesn't want me
to take a bite out of him.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.389
Mmm!

00:56.473 --> 00:57.432
Needs more salt.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.060
[Menuka] All right.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.812
-We're gonna make something really cool.
-[Brandi] Yeah, let's see.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.689
You have any experience with robots?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.149
Not really.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.360
[Justin] Since our eight teams are busy
masterminding their edible robots,

01:09.444 --> 01:11.321
I have one important question to ask,

01:11.863 --> 01:13.907
what are they gonna name
these tasty friends?

01:13.990 --> 01:16.409
R2 Sweet Tooth? Wall-Eat?

01:16.493 --> 01:20.747
C-3POMG That's Delicious?
I could do better and I will work on it.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.249
But first, let's talk to our brain trust.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.377
-Hello, brain trust of judges.
-Hello, Justin.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.546
How you guys doing?
Our teams are hard at work.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.548
What do they have to bake and build today?

01:30.632 --> 01:33.343
Each team of bakineers has to design,
bake and build

01:33.426 --> 01:36.471
an incredible,
edible and functional robot.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.555
Let's build a tank.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.349
-[Sara] An actual tank?
-We make a real tank.

01:39.432 --> 01:43.478
I don't want it to be all military.
Can it be a fun-loving tank on the inside?

01:43.561 --> 01:45.105
[Joey] Let's get a name for this beast.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.273
Something like Peanut Butter.
Peanut Buttercup.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.775
[Mario] Why don't we do a pi nut?

01:48.858 --> 01:50.985
-Like, pi, 3.141.
-[Joey] Pie?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.612
-You wanna make a pie?
-[Mario] Pi nut.

01:52.695 --> 01:56.157
Listen. I'm no math guy. I'll make you
a pie, but I don't know about that pi.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.910
What about, like, Elvis? Elvis-inspired.

01:58.993 --> 02:03.081
-I think I like that.
-It could have dancin' blue suede shoes.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.624
The robots will have to survive

02:04.707 --> 02:07.043
another Baking Impossible stress test.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.005
Their robots will have to speed,
traverse and survive an obstacle course

02:11.089 --> 02:13.299
meant to rigorously test their creations

02:13.383 --> 02:16.052
for both their mechanical
and edible ingenuity.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.013
He needs to be able to navigate,
potentially in small spaces,

02:19.097 --> 02:20.390
-around objects.
-Okay.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.434
I really like a steering arrangement
called reverse tricycle,

02:23.518 --> 02:25.228
which is exactly what it sounds like.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.063
We need to make a tank.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.190
This thing needs to be able to be punched.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.817
Then get back up and keep going.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.238
These robots are gonna have to be
at least two feet in length or width

02:35.321 --> 02:37.323
and at least one foot tall.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.285
We don't know what he has to do yet.
So let's keep the mass low.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.452
Not do anything tall.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.288
I'll push you to do everything light.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.247
Okay.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.582
All the teams have to start

02:45.665 --> 02:48.084
with the same electronic
and structural parts.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.336
They have a pantry full of robotic parts

02:50.420 --> 02:52.213
that includes motors,

02:52.297 --> 02:54.424
claws, beams, wheels,

02:54.507 --> 02:56.801
-tracks, computer brains.
-Wow.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.636
[Hakeem] So, the sky's the limit.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.680
-Have to do jelly.
-Jelly-filled.

03:00.763 --> 03:04.434
So maybe a doughnut with a filling.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.311
Robot parts aside,

03:06.394 --> 03:10.899
let's not forget that everything else
in this robot has to be edible,

03:10.982 --> 03:15.403
and we're asking them
to bake an ooey-gooey confection

03:15.486 --> 03:18.865
that has a creamy center.
Something with jam or cream or jelly.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.868
We're cranking up the complexity
to the next level.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.454
We're looking for a robot
that can complete the course,

03:24.537 --> 03:28.333
but also that has successfully protected
that delicious dessert on the inside.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.211
So they're gonna want to think
carefully about an exoskeleton,

03:31.294 --> 03:33.963
because there might be
some heavy impacts on the course

03:34.047 --> 03:36.049
and we don't wanna see
an ooey-gooey dessert

03:36.132 --> 03:37.508
splattered over the course.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.969
It said it had to protect our dessert.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.680
What's something that's really hard?

03:43.264 --> 03:45.516
-Coconut.
-Coconut.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.393
Do you have any American dessert

03:47.477 --> 03:49.938
that's very light or something like that?

03:50.021 --> 03:52.565
-Like, um, cookies or something.
-[Rodolfo] Where are you from?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.525
-I'm from Buffalo. Oh! Yes.
-Do you have--

03:54.609 --> 03:56.361
Okay, so like, sponge candy.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.280
It's a thing we have
that's like a hard thing, but very light.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.074
-Solid, let's do it.
-We got this.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.034
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

04:07.705 --> 04:10.875
-Watch your back. Right behind you.
-These pro-encoders DC drivers.

04:11.376 --> 04:15.088
This is really fun. Look at all the stuff
I got to make a robot.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.799
I'll get started on the pate a choux.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.512
[Jacob mumbles indistinctly]

04:26.266 --> 04:29.018
Oh, wow. Look at that, fresh coconut.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.020
-Hello!
-Hey, guys! How are you?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.022
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.857
Wow, you guys are hard at work.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.442
-You're sweating.
-Whew!

04:36.526 --> 04:39.404
-[Andrew] This is the coconut station.
-We try to get the meat out.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.823
[Joanne] Tell us about
what you're making today.

04:41.906 --> 04:45.243
We're going to make insect-inspired robot.

04:45.326 --> 04:48.579
So, our robot is a very low-profile robot,

04:48.663 --> 04:50.081
and it's a track system.

04:50.164 --> 04:53.001
[Brandi] And I'm gonna cover the parts

04:53.084 --> 04:56.212
with pineapple skin,
dusted in silver luster dust.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.924
The coconut shells will be
protecting our dessert.

05:00.883 --> 05:01.759
Fabulous.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.887
-So, why a scorpion?
-I like scary, creepy things.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.014
[all laugh]

05:06.097 --> 05:07.265
I'm a weirdo.

05:07.348 --> 05:11.436
And I love a lifelike robot.
That's what I do. I'm a toy designer.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.522
I fall in love with the robotics, um,

05:14.605 --> 05:16.649
after seeing Star Wars.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.484
[chuckling]

05:18.568 --> 05:20.653
I couldn't understand the story.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.781
I was too young 
and my English wasn't that perfect,

05:23.865 --> 05:28.036
but I noticed
they had these little gizmos, C-3PO.

05:28.119 --> 05:32.623
And I knew right away that I want to be
this person who making those things.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.918
When I first came to the States
from Sri Lanka,

05:36.002 --> 05:40.506
I worked in a gas station in the nighttime
and I go to school in the daytime.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.716
It was pretty hard.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.510
Then after I graduate,
I found a very good job

05:45.011 --> 05:48.014
and I design toy
and I license some of the toys

05:48.097 --> 05:49.432
to the big companies.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.019
Most of the stuff I design,
it's never been done before,

05:53.102 --> 05:54.562
which is double cool.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.855
[laughs]

05:55.938 --> 05:57.523
Brandi, as a cake designer,

05:57.607 --> 06:00.568
how are you feeling
working with an engineer like Menuka?

06:00.651 --> 06:03.654
I think it's so cool to see
what all I'll get to learn from him,

06:03.738 --> 06:06.157
so I can take it back
and use it in my business.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.911
My name is Brandi Romines,
and I am from Lexington, Kentucky.

06:09.994 --> 06:12.997
I'm a baker, a wife and a mom to two kids.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.792
I like to bake things
that are not on Pinterest.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.587
I have raging middle kid syndrome.
I got no attention as a child.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.049
So, any way that I can
grab attention with my work,

06:23.132 --> 06:25.760
I'll just go crazy
and think outside the box,

06:25.843 --> 06:27.178
and not the norm.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.847
Brandi, I'd love to know
what we're going to be tasting.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.974
Baby scorpion eggs.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.518
-[Andrew] Ooh.
-[Joanne] Oh!

06:33.601 --> 06:35.978
[Brandi] A coconut cookie thin

06:36.062 --> 06:40.650
that I'm molding into little shapes
so that they'll look like a little egg.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.277
There's a little bit
of coconut-lime jelly in the bottom

06:43.361 --> 06:47.281
and then some whipped
mascarpone whipped cream to go on top.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.117
-That sounds delicious.
-[Brandi] So…

06:49.200 --> 06:50.576
[Joanne] It sounds fragile.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.577
It is.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.790
Are you worried about all the--
Whatever's gonna be happening with this…?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.834
-I am worried that engineer Menuka--
-Man of doom--

06:57.917 --> 07:00.878
-[laughs]
-But Menuka says that we're gonna be okay,

07:00.962 --> 07:03.256
and this is why we have
some good protection.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.051
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

07:07.135 --> 07:08.970
[Rodolfo] I'm gonna put the baking soda

07:09.053 --> 07:11.722
and then you can watch
the reaction happening.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.141
[Sara] This is my sponge candy?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.226
All my Buffalo friends will be so happy.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.728
-Yeah.
-[Sara] What's in yours?

07:17.812 --> 07:21.941
Uh, just vinegar,
corn syrup and baking soda.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.613
[Cindy] I'm gonna eat this. So good.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.074
Cindy and I are making a watermelon robot.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.993
[Cindy] Named Walter the Watermelon.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.370
[Taylor] Walter is made of watermelon,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.122
fondant, modeling chocolate,

07:36.205 --> 07:39.459
and attached to a rubber track
that bring the robot forward and back.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.501
I love watermelon.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.963
For the dessert, I am making
a pate a choux pastry

07:44.046 --> 07:47.550
with a craquelin topping. On the left side
is a strawberry-watermelon mousse,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.802
and on the right side is a basil cream.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.599
I'm literally getting, like,
watermelon juice all over me. [chuckles]

07:57.310 --> 08:00.396
We're well into our bake and build.
Teams are making edible robots.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.898
Over here, Cindy and Taylor,

08:01.981 --> 08:03.566
-they've got watermelons.
-Oop!

08:03.649 --> 08:06.736
-[Renee] How are you?
-Steve and Renee, mixing up chocolate.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.488
-Chocolate.
-[Justin] Delicious.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.616
-Vanessa and Shanice, how you doing?
-Very good.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.576
Good, I'm just getting my steps in.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.745
-You be careful now. [laughs]
-[Justin] All right.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.830
Menuka, come on, show me the robot.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.209
I cannot do robot,
but I can do a slide dance.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.336
I don't know.
I'm bad with doing the robot.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.879
I'm horrible. I'm so sorry.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.172
[Justin] Nina and Hannah.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.715
-[Hannah] Hey.
-How we doing?

08:27.798 --> 08:29.509
-[Nina] We're great!
-[Justin] Action-packed.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.093
Doing something secret.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.803
-[Justin] What's in the thing?
-Ramen!

08:32.887 --> 08:36.098
-That's ramen.
-Ramen, ramen. Ramen?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.559
[upbeat music playing]

08:41.020 --> 08:42.313
[Nina] We need to make something

08:42.396 --> 08:46.901
that's not gonna break
while this bot goes through this course.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.987
So, we're gonna make
an edible, kind of like a plywood almost.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.615
We're crushing up ramen
and tempering chocolate,

08:52.698 --> 08:57.286
and the ramen acts
like, uh, pieces of wood,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.872
and the chocolate acts like a polymer,

08:59.956 --> 09:01.207
kind of like a glue.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.125
So I created a new wood for you.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.463
And that's a hole.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.342
Stop!

09:14.595 --> 09:17.181
So, Menuka,
did I tell you about my gummy bear idea?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.392
So, I'm melting down gummy bears.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.227
I'm making edible glue.

09:22.812 --> 09:27.775
I discovered that melting down gummy bears
in a microwave, after they re-hardened,

09:27.858 --> 09:29.318
they were very stretchy.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.239
So, I said that to Menuka and he was like,
"You should try adding chocolate."

09:33.322 --> 09:35.616
I'm gonna add the chocolate
and see what it does.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.534
[Menuka] All right.

09:36.617 --> 09:40.204
[Brandi] And so, when we did
we made almost like, an edible epoxy.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.206
We plan to use our gummy glue

09:42.290 --> 09:46.127
to attach the pineapple skin
to our robot parts.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.045
Nothing that stuff won't stick to.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.632
-You should trademark them.
-We should patent this.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.550
[timer ticking]

09:56.846 --> 09:59.515
I'm doing, uh, the blue suede shoes now.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.225
Oh, perfect. Okay, cool.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.899
-[Steve] How's it going, Renee?
-[screwdriver whirring]

10:08.983 --> 10:12.194
Um, probably about ten minutes
to put the wheels on

10:12.278 --> 10:14.363
and then we'll have
all the bottom finished.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.699
Steve and I are creating Roger Rover,

10:16.782 --> 10:20.244
who is a robot on the surface of Mars

10:20.328 --> 10:22.079
that is also a candy factory.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.957
Anything Mars or rover related,

10:25.041 --> 10:28.544
I instantly get attached to
because that's what I work with every day.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.673
I love how the bot matches my outfit.
That was totally intentional.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.675
I helped design the antennas

10:34.759 --> 10:38.721
and the RF components
that are on the Artemis missions for NASA.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.682
And that's actually gonna be used
to send humans to Mars.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.435
-Hello, Renee.
-How are you?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.771
-Wonderful. Steve, how are you?
-Hello, Steve. [chuckles]

10:46.854 --> 10:48.147
Welcome to our station.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.317
We had a little bit of operator error
with your boat,

10:51.400 --> 10:52.693
I think it'd be fair to say.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.654
How are you leading on the engineering?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.155
I need to be focused.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.075
And I'm going to learn and leverage
from that past experience

10:59.158 --> 11:00.993
to be really game-face,

11:01.077 --> 11:03.579
heads down when I'm driving the robot
around the course,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.414
so I don't make that mistake again.

11:05.498 --> 11:09.543
Do you have a contingency plan
for if you just happen to get excited?

11:10.044 --> 11:13.464
-[Steve] I'll just grab the controller.
-[all laugh]

11:13.547 --> 11:16.384
As long as we get this thing running,
we'll be in the game.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.302
-Okay.
-Now it's on my partner.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.595
-Best of luck.
-Thank you.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.513
Good luck, guys.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.556
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

11:24.600 --> 11:26.769
Concentrating on my caramel now.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.777
-[Menuka] What are you making now?
-[Brandi] Coconut-lime jelly.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.113
-Wow.
-It said "jelly-filled."

11:38.155 --> 11:42.201
I'm really scared of that obstacle course.
I really hope he's gonna make it.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.285
Our baby bot.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.705
-You're gonna drive it, right?
-Yeah.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.997
I'm a junior in college,

11:47.081 --> 11:49.625
studying mechanical engineering
as my major.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.377
I'm the youngest person here.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.256
However, I've been making things
with my hands for over half my life.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.843
My dad introduced me to engineering
around sixth or seventh grade.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.846
The project that I am most proud of
that I built with my dad

12:01.929 --> 12:04.265
is something we call the techno desk.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.018
The rule of the techno desk is
everything has to do something.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.105
So, there's an actual
antique gooseneck speaker

12:11.188 --> 12:14.900
that is connected to a weather radio
that I rewired, so it all talks together.

12:14.984 --> 12:18.070
There's a shredder,
there's a place to charge your phone,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.573
a sensor that lets you know
when your mail's arrived,

12:20.656 --> 12:23.200
there's a reset button
for your Wi-Fi router, like--

12:23.701 --> 12:25.286
And we made this.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.371
Oh, it's such a special project to me.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.041
I have a techno desk and it's just lovely.
I love using it. [chuckles]

12:31.125 --> 12:32.501
Nina, what are you working on?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.836
Marmalade. I'm gonna make

12:33.919 --> 12:35.671
-the orange marmalade.
-Ooh!

12:35.755 --> 12:36.922
Yummy.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.340
-Hello. How are you?
-Hello.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.760
-Good, how are you?
-[Andrew] Fantastic.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.430
The jaws of defeat. There was
a few engineering problems with your boat.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.932
What are you changing in your approach?
[chuckles]

12:47.016 --> 12:49.810
Um, definitely weight distribution.
But to counteract that,

12:49.894 --> 12:53.022
we're gonna line the inside with fondant
to weigh it down.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.607
Just in case it gets hit,

12:54.690 --> 12:57.276
I wanna make sure
it can take a hit and keep going.

12:57.359 --> 13:01.697
Our robot is a researcher
on a different planet.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.575
Uh, planet Patch. His name is Archie Bot.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.703
[Hannah] The body is
Rice Krispies covered in fondant.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
We both like older things,

13:09.872 --> 13:13.417
so we wanted to go with
kind of like a cute, little, beat-up,

13:13.501 --> 13:15.127
old little robot dude.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.421
We came out with a new compound

13:17.505 --> 13:19.882
that's basically
a brand-new edible medium.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.801
-So, I crushed up ramen noodles.
-Yes.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.470
And then I tempered chocolate,
and I made the mix.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.056
Then rolled it out and,
if you wanna knock on wood.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.265
-That's amazing!
-May I--

13:28.349 --> 13:30.768
-[Joanne] Ooh!
-[Nina] We'll have these super, galaxy,

13:30.851 --> 13:34.063
meteoroid cookies be protected
by this compound.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.274
For this mission,
we have to do something jelly-filled,

13:37.358 --> 13:42.112
so I'm making Linzer cookies
and a homemade orange marmalade.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.240
They're made with my grandma's recipe.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.825
I grew up in Slovakia

13:45.908 --> 13:49.662
and my parents own a restaurant,
so I was always in the kitchen.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.997
So, when I was 18, I packed up my bags

13:52.081 --> 13:56.377
and came to the US
just to kind of see a different world.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.295
I went to culinary school.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.840
Now, I own Nina's Fresh Bakery

14:00.923 --> 14:02.591
in Jupiter, Florida.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.135
And I'm very proud of my business.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.305
I mean, I had $1,500
when I showed up here in the US.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.932
I cannot believe I'm here.

14:10.015 --> 14:10.975
This is a dream.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.935
It's-- This is amazing.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.186
Pinch me. [chuckles]

14:14.937 --> 14:16.480
-You feeling confident?
-[Hannah] Yeah.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.483
As long as she makes it move,
I can make it edible.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.442
[all chuckle]

14:20.526 --> 14:21.986
[timer ticking]

14:22.069 --> 14:25.614
We need to keep in mind
that we're carrying desserts and cake and…

14:25.698 --> 14:28.534
Yeah, we don't know
what kind of track we'll be running on.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.661
Could be a racetrack,
could be a dirt road.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.500
This feels like something
that maybe has not been done ever.

14:36.584 --> 14:40.254
-Sewing watermelon together with--
-[Cindy] Cool.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.173
Good. Nice.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.345
[Vanessa] I'm gonna spray the wafer paper
with a little glitter.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.931
Me and Shanice are creating a piñata bot.

14:51.015 --> 14:51.974
Her name is Fiesta.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.561
Basically, it brings
a celebration to your storefront.

14:55.644 --> 15:00.316
Our robot is gonna be a rectangular shape,
completely covered in wafer paper,

15:00.399 --> 15:02.192
airbrushed in several different colors

15:02.276 --> 15:05.237
and shredded
to replicate a piñata's flakes.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.450
My arms are gonna be so sore after this.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.578
And then we're using tempered chocolate
for the entire body.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.122
Tempered chocolate when it sets,
it gets rock solid,

15:15.205 --> 15:18.250
so we decided
tempered chocolate would be our best bet

15:18.334 --> 15:20.502
to go through all these obstacle courses.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.338
Inside, it's covering and protecting

15:22.421 --> 15:26.175
our doughnuts filled with guayaba
and queso crema drizzle,

15:26.258 --> 15:28.344
with a little bit of graham crackers.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.805
-[dramatic music playing]
-[timer ticking]

15:32.514 --> 15:33.766
What you got going on?

15:33.849 --> 15:36.435
-[Rodolfo] I made the pate a choux.
-[Sara] Pate a choux?

15:36.518 --> 15:38.812
[Rodolfo] With my Portuguese accent.
[chuckles]

15:38.896 --> 15:41.106
These are the top parts
that I'm talking about.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.900
-[Taylor] Do they melt down?
-[Cindy] Yeah.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.944
-They're so beautiful.
-Yay.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.198
[Joey] I'm doing two different fillings.
We got peanut butter mousse,

15:49.281 --> 15:51.075
then we come in
with chocolate pudding.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.245
[Brandi] See how cute these are gonna be?

15:55.329 --> 15:57.581
They're gonna be
little baby scorpion eggs.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.832
[timer ticking]

15:58.916 --> 16:00.918
Bakineers, can I have your attention?

16:01.877 --> 16:05.172
As you remember,
Cindy and Taylor won the last mission,

16:05.255 --> 16:07.091
which earned them a big boost.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.134
-Great.
-What?

16:09.218 --> 16:12.054
-Yeah.
-Boo. Boo!

16:12.137 --> 16:16.558
Since you won the last mission,
you've earned a sneak peek

16:16.642 --> 16:18.644
at this mission's stress test.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.688
Oh, my gosh.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.272
Bummer.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.357
[Sara groans]

16:24.316 --> 16:26.068
-[Brandi] That sucks.
-That sucks.

16:26.151 --> 16:30.406
What you see back there will definitely
affect your entire bakineering approach.

16:31.031 --> 16:34.284
Know what? I might be willing
to answer a few questions of yours too.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.995
Huge advantage.

16:36.078 --> 16:36.954
Follow me.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.962
-Okay.
-[Cindy gasps]

16:45.045 --> 16:49.008
Welcome to the second stress test.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.342
Oh, my God.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.636
Like, those-- What are those?

16:53.762 --> 16:56.015
I'm gonna talk you through
the whole thing now.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.642
You're gonna want to watch out for this.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.602
-[popping sounds]
-[Cindy squeals]

17:02.563 --> 17:04.523
[Taylor] What's that terrain made of?
What is it?

17:04.606 --> 17:07.317
-[Andrew] So, those are mini marshmallows.
-[Cindy and Taylor gasp]

17:07.401 --> 17:10.195
-[Andrew] There's about 10,000.
-[Taylor] That's a beast to get through.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.489
-I thought they were rocks. [laughs]
-I thought so too.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.076
So, he just needs
to get through that first.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.245
Pause, then go.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.329
Oh, my God.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.707
-I wish it was--
-Maybe they'll tell us.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.833
[Rodolfo chuckles]

17:22.916 --> 17:24.710
Off you go. Back to the bake and build.

17:24.793 --> 17:25.711
Thank you so much.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.342
All right.

17:32.426 --> 17:36.597
-That was actually really helpful.
-That was really helpful.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.640
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

17:38.724 --> 17:39.725
[humming]

17:42.061 --> 17:43.604
[Mario] Why is he going backwards?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.483
Do we have marshmallows?

17:48.233 --> 17:50.903
-Yeah, but let's do it, like-- Hide it.
-Yeah.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.323
[Taylor] Okay.
Luckily, we have the advantage.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.659
[Cindy] Oh, yeah.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.621
[Taylor] They get in there, but it doesn't
do anything that's a problem.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.622
Okay, sweet.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.041
[Taylor] No need for design change.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.086
-[Cindy] Make sure we throw these away.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

18:08.545 --> 18:09.797
[dramatic music playing]

18:10.964 --> 18:12.382
[drill whirring]

18:14.259 --> 18:18.347
It moves really, really slow.
That's without anything on it.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.141
Every robot's gonna have
a lot of trouble on this course.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.434
[Vanessa] Go forward.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.358
[Shanice] Vanessa, this is
how slow it is at 500%.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.859
[Vanessa] Something has to be wrong.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.778
[Shanice] Back tires aren't even spinning.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.695
[Vanessa] I know.

18:34.446 --> 18:38.158
-Does it turn left and right?
-[Shanice] It literally turns like that.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.370
Right now, there's no weight on this.
This doesn't weigh at all.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.665
-So, what's gonna happen when we put--
-[Shanice] I don't know.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.833
You wanna try to code this?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.000
[tense music playing]

18:49.169 --> 18:51.171
I don't know. Figure it out, then.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.800
Ay-ay-ay.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.055
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

19:00.139 --> 19:02.391
Bakineers, two hours.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.017
[Rodolfo] Here we go.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.895
[Sara] We're doing this?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.689
-We're gonna assemble here.
-Sweet.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.649
And every corner. We hit it with fondant.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.567
[Mario] Love it.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.277
-How's everything coming?
-[Brandi] Good.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.946
[Menuka] Those pineapple is
for the skin of the robot?

19:16.029 --> 19:20.784
Shh. He's, like, telling our secret.
Don't start blabbing everything.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.039
[rattling]

19:27.124 --> 19:28.458
[Jacob] I love him!

19:29.376 --> 19:32.004
Is this not the coolest thing
you've seen in a long time?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.088
[timer ticking]

19:34.548 --> 19:36.300
One hour left.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.385
[Renee mutters]

19:38.468 --> 19:42.306
We need to start decorating,
'cause clock's ticking.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.560
This looks really good.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.937
[Sara] It's not burning?

19:49.021 --> 19:52.316
-No, because here is still wet.
-[Sara] Those look great.

19:52.399 --> 19:55.235
-Hold it. It's quick. You gotta move.
-Get ready to rip it off.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.863
-Dude, you gotta move. I gotta lay it on.
-Lay it on.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.866
Just lay it on.
I'm gonna re-solder. That's it.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.034
[fast-paced music playing]

20:09.666 --> 20:10.876
[Hannah sighs]

20:13.795 --> 20:14.880
[whispers] Oh, my God.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.471
I am close to tears looking at Archie Bot,

20:22.554 --> 20:24.181
and not for the aesthetics,

20:24.264 --> 20:26.141
but because I was disappointed in myself

20:26.225 --> 20:27.976
that I couldn't get the code to work.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.061
He's not turning.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.064
He goes backwards when I tell him to turn.

20:33.190 --> 20:37.152
I'm feeling very stressed about it
because there's literally not enough time.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.072
[Hannah] Archie Bot can only go
forwards and backwards.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.116
These other ones look like
they can go forwards, backwards,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.202
and left and right.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.705
That's two more directions
than ours can go.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.876
To make it go left, these go backwards
and the other one goes forward.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.587
I programmed it to do that
and it doesn't follow it.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.214
There's no time to troubleshoot.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.884
You guys wanna go prepare
for the stress test?

21:00.968 --> 21:02.886
-I'll take it from here.
-Let's do this.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.096
[Justin] See you soon.

21:07.307 --> 21:11.728
Bakineers, our brain trust is off
to prepare for the stress test.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.064
You've got 20 minutes.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.941
[timer ticking]

21:17.651 --> 21:19.528
-[Rodolfo] Here?
-[Sara] It isn't holding until--

21:19.611 --> 21:21.446
-[Rodolfo] Yeah.
-It's coming off.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.407
We have to hold some pressure on it.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.117
[Steve] Okay. Dessert.

21:28.996 --> 21:29.997
It's very good.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.297
Bakineers, five minutes.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.424
-[Rodolfo] Five minutes.
-[mock screams]

21:43.468 --> 21:46.346
[Brandi] All right, that's gonna stay.
I can't quit fooling with that.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.515
[Mario] I need to paste something there,
so hurry up.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.766
"Hurry up," he says.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.643
Hold this. Just hold this still.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.937
-Give me some more modeling chocolate.
-[timer ticking]

21:57.983 --> 22:00.444
-[can hissing]
-We got this, we got this, bro.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.323
-Homey, what?
-[Nina] We need to put the cookies in.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.451
[Brandi] Menuka, I'm getting ready
to put these on.

22:12.497 --> 22:16.793
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

22:16.877 --> 22:20.047
six, five, four,

22:20.130 --> 22:23.008
three, two, one.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.635
Screwdrivers and spatulas down,

22:25.719 --> 22:28.013
your time is up.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.056
[all applauding]

22:32.726 --> 22:36.855
Bakineers, are you ready
to face your robot reckoning?

22:36.938 --> 22:39.775
I've got a tasty little friend
who's gonna lead the way.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.651
-Aww.
-Come join.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.155
It's a slow, dramatic build. Okay.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.324
Maybe he'll go faster.
Petey, meet us there.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.825
[all chuckle]

22:50.243 --> 22:53.872
Behold your robot obstacle course.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.999
-[Rodolfo] Whoa!
-[Renee] Oh, my gosh!

22:56.083 --> 22:57.334
-[all gasp]
-[Rodolfo laughs]

22:57.417 --> 22:58.710
[dramatic music playing]

22:59.753 --> 23:00.754
[Renee laughing]

23:00.837 --> 23:01.671
Oh, my God!

23:01.755 --> 23:03.090
-[Nina] What is that?
-Ice cream.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.967
-[Joey] We gotta go through that course.
-[Nina] That's marshmallows.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.471
-[Renee] Oh, my gosh. [laughs]
-[Justin] You all look thrilled.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.520
Bakineers, welcome to our best-in-bot

23:16.603 --> 23:18.480
robot obstacle course.

23:18.563 --> 23:22.401
Also known as
the bust-a-bot robot obstacle course.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.485
[contestants laugh]

23:23.568 --> 23:24.820
[Andrew] Here's how it works.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.115
Each of your edible bots will start
at the starting line.

23:28.198 --> 23:31.118
Your robot goes
through the candy cane slalom,

23:31.201 --> 23:33.745
then it's on to Candy Mountain

23:33.829 --> 23:36.790
and its sugar dust cannons.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.708
[popping]

23:38.792 --> 23:41.253
-[Sara] Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh!

23:41.336 --> 23:43.046
[Renee laughs]

23:43.130 --> 23:44.214
Think I just peed.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.174
Next, your robot will have to 

23:46.258 --> 23:49.302
make it through
this marshmallow Winter Wonderland,

23:50.303 --> 23:53.473
then it's on
to one of my personal favorites,

23:53.557 --> 23:55.142
the swing of Ding Dongs.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.978
You don't wanna Google
"swing of Ding Dongs." Okay?

23:58.061 --> 23:59.646
[all laughing]

24:03.900 --> 24:06.153
[Andrew] Here you'll have to
perfectly time your movements

24:06.236 --> 24:08.989
to survive
the swinging chocolate pendulums.

24:09.531 --> 24:13.535
Then your robots will have to
carefully traverse this narrow bridge,

24:13.618 --> 24:17.330
cross the finish line.
We'll be judging your creations on design,

24:17.414 --> 24:19.749
functionality, ingenuity and taste,

24:19.833 --> 24:23.545
and how well your bots protect
your ooey-gooey dessert.

24:24.045 --> 24:27.632
You know, this challenge also inspired me
to protect my own little tasty treat.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.384
[coughing]

24:29.885 --> 24:31.011
[clears throat]

24:31.094 --> 24:33.305
[all cheering, laughing]

24:34.890 --> 24:36.808
[Justin] Which is a gift for the loser.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.727
-So, we'll see who gets that.
-[all laugh]

24:38.810 --> 24:40.604
Until then, I'll give it to Andrew.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.980
Thank you. Just leave it there.

24:42.063 --> 24:42.939
[all laugh]

24:43.899 --> 24:46.526
[Andrew] You have five minutes
for your bots to complete the course.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.906
But, in order to pass this mission,
it must cross the finish line

24:50.989 --> 24:53.575
and still have all its robot bits intact.

24:54.242 --> 24:57.245
If not,
you will have failed this stress test.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.456
If your bot is obliterated,

24:59.539 --> 25:01.875
then your desserts better be
good enough to save you.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.213
If it's not, you could be out of here.

25:06.296 --> 25:09.424
All right, let's get
the robot dessert destruction started.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.636
Shall we?
Up first, Brandi, Menuka, you're up!

25:12.719 --> 25:14.179
[all cheer]

25:14.262 --> 25:15.472
[Brandi] Here we go.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.017
We went with the scorpion theme.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.355
I sliced all the skin off the pineapples
and dried it out in the microwave

25:23.438 --> 25:24.856
to cover all the parts.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.693
To protect our desserts,
we used coconut shells.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.363
And then we made
almost like an edible epoxy

25:31.446 --> 25:34.866
with gummy bears
and chocolate for them to sit on.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.703
For this robot,
I went with a very high gear ratio

25:38.787 --> 25:40.413
with a really big driver.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.833
I want to keep everything low.
I don't want to do the same mistake we did

25:43.917 --> 25:47.712
with the Viking ship,
because I want to have a nice stability.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.756
[Justin] Let's see if the scorpion
has some bite.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.467
Please place your robot
on the starting line.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.344
-Are you ready?
-[Menuka] Ready.

25:54.427 --> 25:59.349
Your race begins in three, two, one,

25:59.432 --> 26:00.934
-go.
-[dramatic music playing]

26:02.102 --> 26:03.144
All right.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.481
Scorpion versus the candy cane slalom.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.778
There she goes.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.158
[Menuka] Keep going,
keep going, keep going.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.497
-[Justin] She's going up the ramp.
-[Menuka] Those are powerful motors.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.999
-[Brandi] Yeah!
-[contestants cheer]

26:24.082 --> 26:26.334
-[Justin] Up Candy Mountain.
-[cannon pops]

26:26.418 --> 26:28.878
[Justin] Oh, that scared
the candy out of me.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.840
He doesn't need those tracks.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.592
Down the ramp, well done.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.344
Candy Mountain is
in the books for this bot.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.680
Boy, this'll be interesting
without the belts.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.639
[all exclaiming]

26:40.807 --> 26:44.978
[Justin] It looks like these marshmallows
are putting the bot in a sticky situation.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.397
[Sara] Go! Come on!

26:47.480 --> 26:48.982
[all cheering, applauding]

26:52.485 --> 26:53.403
[Justin] Oh, boy.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.530
Time is ticking.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.201
No!

27:00.285 --> 27:02.495
-[chuckles]
-[contestants groaning]

27:02.579 --> 27:04.873
[Justin] This one is
a real nail-biter, judges.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.166
Yay!

27:08.877 --> 27:10.211
Time is running out.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.630
[Brandi] Go!

27:11.713 --> 27:15.508
-[Justin] Through the swing of Ding Dongs.
-[Brandi] Yay!

27:17.135 --> 27:19.179
-Oh, my God!
-[Joey] Come on!

27:19.262 --> 27:20.764
[contestants cheering]

27:20.847 --> 27:23.850
[Justin] Will he or won't he?

27:25.977 --> 27:29.314
-It has achieved an impossible miracle!
-[all cheering]

27:29.397 --> 27:31.941
-The scorpion has crossed the finish line.
-[laughing]

27:33.610 --> 27:35.612
-[contestants cheering]
-[Brandi] Whoo!

27:37.447 --> 27:40.492
Brandi and Menuka,
I have to say that when I saw your bot,

27:40.575 --> 27:42.035
I was impressed at the start.

27:42.118 --> 27:45.580
But, clearly,
you had a bit of difficulty on the course,

27:45.664 --> 27:47.207
and it had to do with your tracks.

27:47.290 --> 27:50.669
The marshmallow pit was a bit too much
and the tracks came off.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.712
In a really strange way,

27:52.796 --> 27:56.132
the failings of the robot
shows its strengths,

27:56.216 --> 27:59.302
because this robot had a lot of power
and a lot of robustness,

27:59.386 --> 28:01.096
so even after all it went through…

28:01.179 --> 28:03.640
It left the piece all over the board.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.975
…it still made it to the end.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.435
So, very good job.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.270
-Thank you.
-[Hakeem] You're welcome.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.606
Brandi, Menuka. Congrats.

28:11.690 --> 28:16.653
You've made it through the stress test.
Now we want to know what we get to taste.

28:16.736 --> 28:17.737
[Brandi] Okay.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.072
[gasps]

28:19.155 --> 28:20.240
Yay!

28:20.323 --> 28:22.450
-[Justin] Success? Survived?
-[Brandi] Yeah.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.368
Here.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.580
The dessert is a baby scorpion egg.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.542
There you go. Just crack the egg,

28:30.625 --> 28:33.712
which is a coconut thin cookie.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.132
And encased is
some coconut-lime jelly

28:37.215 --> 28:39.551
with some mascarpone whipped cream on top

28:39.634 --> 28:41.803
to balance out the sweetness of the jelly.

28:41.886 --> 28:46.933
Brandi, I really am so taken
by this adorable idea of the eggs,

28:47.016 --> 28:49.853
uh, with the coconut tuile
and the mousse inside.

28:49.936 --> 28:53.690
It's really fun to eat,
but the tuile is a little bit chewy.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.236
I think it's really ingenious
what you've done with the pineapple,

28:58.319 --> 29:00.363
in particular, is very striking.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.783
Your ingenious use
of that gummy bear, chocolate mixture.

29:03.867 --> 29:07.036
I'm sure you're probably keeping that
a closely-guarded secret recipe…

29:07.120 --> 29:09.080
-[Brandi clicks tongue]
-…for that adhesive.

29:09.164 --> 29:13.293
That's what this competition is all about.
You're discovering new, edible composites.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.419
Thank you so much.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.837
-Thank you.
-Well done.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.297
[Brandi sighs]

29:17.380 --> 29:19.591
Randi, Jacob, let's meet your bot.

29:20.341 --> 29:23.428
[Jacob] King is our 1950s jukebox,

29:23.511 --> 29:25.263
inspired by Elvis.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.181
[Justin] Here we go.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.808
[Jacob] Yeah.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.185
Oh.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.062
-[Hannah] Hey.
-[Justin] Tight corner there, nice.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.063
Elvis lives.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.857
-[cannon pops]
-[Justin] Oh!

29:35.940 --> 29:37.567
Go, go, go, go!

29:37.650 --> 29:39.569
-The King can--
-[Andrew] Yeah!

29:39.652 --> 29:41.654
-[Justin] Oh!
-[all cheer]

29:43.948 --> 29:44.866
[all groan]

29:45.575 --> 29:47.869
-[Randi] Go!
-[Jacob chuckling] Whoa!

29:47.952 --> 29:48.912
[laughs]

29:50.038 --> 29:50.955
[Randi] All right!

29:52.290 --> 29:53.792
-Oh, come on.
-[Justin] Go.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.628
-[Hakeem chuckles]
-[Jacob] Come on, King. Come on, man.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.631
Did he sustain some damage from that hit?

29:59.714 --> 30:00.799
[Jacob] He may have.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.717
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

30:02.801 --> 30:03.760
[Joanne] Oh, yeah.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.512
[Jacob] We appear to be a little stuck.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.223
[Justin] Oh, looks like
that's it for The King.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.975
That's okay.

30:11.518 --> 30:15.939
Randi, Jacob, we're very excited
to taste whatever lurks in that jukebox.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.315
There they are.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.441
Ah.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.484
[Justin] All right.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.903
Randi, this dessert is fantastic.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.239
-Thank you.
-[Joanne] The cake is moist.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.199
-It's very well-balanced.
-[Randi] Thank you.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.535
I don't think there's anything
I'd do differently.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.744
That's wonderful.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.122
I really like the fact
that when you look at The King,

30:33.206 --> 30:34.666
we can't see any of those parts.

30:34.749 --> 30:38.002
You made your own gingerbread,
and the use of a lighter material on top,

30:38.086 --> 30:39.712
-very well done.
-Thank you.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.965
I love the design of the cake.

30:42.048 --> 30:45.927
You made large pieces,
but you have a very small DC motor.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.763
I can certainly understand
why the batteries would go dead,

30:48.847 --> 30:51.850
but I love the lights,
I love the moving parts in the inside.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.561
[imitates Elvis] So, thank you. 
Thank you very much.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.312
[all laughing]

30:57.397 --> 30:59.899
Vanessa and Shanice.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.276
-Get your creation.
-[all applaud]

31:01.985 --> 31:03.695
[Shanice] Our robot's name is Fiesta.

31:03.778 --> 31:06.406
We kind of wanted to take
a fun and celebratory spin on it.

31:06.489 --> 31:07.323
[Justin] Go!

31:08.116 --> 31:09.909
-[Vanessa] Wait.
-You're all right.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.786
-[Justin] Ooh!
-Nice.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.413
-[Joanne] Wow.
-[Justin] Nice pivot.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.789
Very nice.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.165
Come on, girl, keep moving.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.630
[robot whirring]

31:22.714 --> 31:23.798
Why is it doing that?

31:26.759 --> 31:29.178
Come on.
I wonder if one of our motors are dying.

31:29.762 --> 31:32.390
That sounds like
a will-not-engage-in-a-gear.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.268
-Maybe Fiesta needs a siesta.
-Yep.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.145
[Justin] Last call in three,

31:37.228 --> 31:39.522
-two, one.
-[all groan]

31:39.606 --> 31:41.608
-[buzzer sounds]
-[Brandi] Hey, good job, girls.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.945
One of the first things
that jumps out at me

31:46.029 --> 31:48.489
is the structure of your wheel.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.493
You have this triangular structure
that might not have been my first choice.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.787
Okay, it would not have been
my first choice.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.831
And the reason it's so unstable 

31:56.915 --> 32:00.293
is because each of those three gears
that engages that track

32:00.376 --> 32:03.504
have to have tension on them at all times,

32:03.588 --> 32:06.299
or else those gears are gonna disengage,

32:06.382 --> 32:10.053
and you're gonna have a spinning motor,
just like you have now.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.389
Even though
Fiesta couldn't finish the course,

32:13.473 --> 32:15.725
we still wanna taste these doughnuts.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.354
[Joanne] I am thrilled
that you made a doughnut.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.689
I really like
the cream cheese frosting on top.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.816
The guava paste is delicious.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.362
The doughnuts themselves,
um, could be a little bit lighter.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.659
How do you guys feel like
you worked together in this mission?

32:32.742 --> 32:35.078
We started getting stressed out
and kinda clashing.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.205
I think that was reflected in your design.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.666
The engineering and the baking
looked a bit separate.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.210
We want things
that look beautifully integrated,

32:42.293 --> 32:45.213
and I think it perhaps could've been
a little bit more cohesive.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.466
-[contestants applaud]
-Up next, Nina and Hannah.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.842
[contestants cheer]

32:50.927 --> 32:53.930
[Nina] Meet Archie Bot from planet Patch.

32:54.013 --> 32:57.392
Meteoroids hit planet Patch constantly.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.478
[Nina] He collects these meteoroids,

33:00.561 --> 33:02.981
which are our dessert portions.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.942
[Hannah] His main body and his trailer is

33:06.025 --> 33:08.027
Rice Krispies covered in fondant,

33:08.736 --> 33:12.240
except for
where the meteoroids are stored.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.785
We basically made this "edible" plywood

33:15.868 --> 33:18.830
from crushed-up ramen
and tempered chocolate,

33:18.913 --> 33:21.124
so they're gonna protect the cookies.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.834
All right. Nina, Hannah,

33:22.917 --> 33:25.211
let's see if Archie Bot
can handle the stress test.

33:25.294 --> 33:28.339
-You wanna pop him on the starting line?
-[Hannah sighs]

33:28.423 --> 33:32.010
Okay. Nina, Hannah,
Archie Bot, you guys ready to go?

33:32.093 --> 33:35.388
-Yes.
-Three, two, one.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.472
Go.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.141
Go. All right.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.309
-[Nina] Go! No!
-Not the whole body.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.478
[Nina] No!
-[gasps] Oh! Ooh.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.772
Okay, so he doesn't turn.

33:45.982 --> 33:46.816
[Joey chuckles]

33:47.525 --> 33:48.651
[chuckles]

33:48.735 --> 33:50.611
So, I'm going to pivot him.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.991
[Nina] Put it straight. Do it quick.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.909
[Hannah] I'm trying, man. [grunts]

33:56.993 --> 33:58.369
-Don't go right.
-[Nina] No!

33:58.453 --> 33:59.328
[Renee yells]

33:59.412 --> 34:02.498
-[Joanne] Oh, no!
-Oh, no. Oh!

34:02.582 --> 34:05.418
Oh, my goodness.

34:05.501 --> 34:06.753
-This--
-[laughs]

34:06.836 --> 34:07.920
Go!

34:08.004 --> 34:09.881
Archie's looking to turn this around,

34:09.964 --> 34:12.592
except he cannot turn.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.469
-No!
-[Nina groans]

34:15.762 --> 34:16.846
[Hannah] Stop it.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.681
I'm getting a heart attack.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.018
[laughing] You can't do that.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.605
I love how every time
you're surprised that he can't turn.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.856
[both laughing]

34:26.939 --> 34:28.399
[Hannah groans]

34:28.483 --> 34:30.193
-No.
-[all laughing]

34:30.610 --> 34:31.944
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.071
[laughter continues]

34:34.781 --> 34:36.491
-[Hannah] Go!
-[Justin] All right, Archie!

34:36.574 --> 34:38.159
-Go!
-[cannon pops]

34:38.242 --> 34:39.744
-[Hannah shrieks]
-[cannon popping]

34:40.953 --> 34:43.206
[Hannah groaning]

34:43.790 --> 34:45.374
[Nina] Go into the marshmallows.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.502
[Hannah] Go!

34:49.128 --> 34:52.215
-[Justin] Go, go, go, go, go!
-No, he's not gonna make it.

34:52.298 --> 34:55.551
It's amazing
how difficult the marshmallows are.

34:56.135 --> 34:59.263
It's a real test of how well
they've distributed their traction.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.642
[Hannah] Shoot.
One of the motors is smoking.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.268
[groans]

35:05.144 --> 35:07.271
The other three died.
I think that's it for Archie.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.190
Aww.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.441
[Hannah] Let's call it.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.445
Poor Archie's dreams
have gone up in smoke.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.949
-All right, give it up for Archie Bot.
-[Brandi] Aw, good job!

35:20.326 --> 35:23.246
[Hakeem] Nina and Hannah,
your design fell short.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.872
I thought it looked pretty robust.

35:24.956 --> 35:25.998
It looks well-balanced.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.794
I like the trailer
as a nice little trick for stability,

35:29.877 --> 35:31.921
but your DC motors are burning out

35:32.004 --> 35:34.632
because your robot is way too heavy.

35:34.715 --> 35:37.218
The weight
of all the edible materials you used

35:37.301 --> 35:40.138
was far greater
than what those motors could handle.

35:40.221 --> 35:43.724
And because your robot was so heavy,
that's why it couldn't turn.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.144
Our engineers have to really step it up

35:46.227 --> 35:48.396
on the performance
and function side of things.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.607
There is $100,000 at stake.

35:51.691 --> 35:55.278
And if I had $100,000 at stake,
I'd be taking it really seriously.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.031
Nina and Hannah, you've unfortunately
failed the stress test.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.784
But we're very excited to see

36:01.868 --> 36:05.413
what treat
Archie Bot's been holding out on us.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.089
[Nina] So, these are my grandma's recipe.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.551
It's a Linzer cookie
with homemade orange marmalade.

36:18.634 --> 36:23.222
And I used disco dust
to do the galaxy effect on it.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.892
Nina, your grandmother knows
how to make marmalade.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.227
-Oh!
-[Joanne] But in these baking challenges,

36:28.311 --> 36:30.938
I do wanna see all of your pastry skills.

36:31.522 --> 36:34.233
Going forward,
maybe push yourself a little bit more

36:34.317 --> 36:36.903
to show us
a little bit more of your pastry talents.

36:37.403 --> 36:40.031
Design-wise,
you gave yourselves a lot of work to do.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.909
You had a lot of quantity,
in terms of covering

36:42.992 --> 36:46.120
and maybe there had to be sacrifices
on quality as you went along.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.747
There was so much area to cover.

36:47.830 --> 36:51.667
It was always gonna be a tough task.
One thing I did love about your design

36:51.751 --> 36:54.170
was your discovery
of an entirely new material,

36:54.253 --> 36:56.005
chocolate-ramen noodles.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.257
It's the edible version
of reinforced concrete.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.344
So, really clever use.
So, congratulations on that discovery.

37:01.427 --> 37:02.637
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

37:03.137 --> 37:06.098
Up next, Steve and Renee.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.143
[Renee] This is Roger Rover,
the Candy Factory.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.271
Three, two, one, go.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.564
[motor whirring]

37:15.775 --> 37:19.904
[Justin] Roger is having a bit of trouble
crossing the starting line.

37:19.987 --> 37:23.950
Come on. That might be
a bad sign of things to come.

37:24.450 --> 37:27.620
-It's not going anywhere.
-Miscalculation on my part.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.377
Clock's ticking.

37:35.002 --> 37:38.714
I believe we miscalculated
the amount of weight capacity

37:38.798 --> 37:40.466
that my design can handle.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.218
-Oh, no.
-[buzzer sounds]

37:42.301 --> 37:43.844
[Justin] Joey, Mario.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.680
[Joey] We'd like
to introduce you to Pi-nut.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.349
You ready to race?

37:49.016 --> 37:49.850
-Pi-nut.
-[applause]

37:49.934 --> 37:51.102
-[cannon pops]
-[Renee shrieks]

37:51.852 --> 37:54.438
-[Renee] Scares me every time.
-[Andrew] It's moving better.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.148
-[Renee] No!
-[Sara] No!

37:56.232 --> 37:57.984
-[contestants groaning]
-[laughs]

37:59.235 --> 38:01.362
That's a hard one to come up back from.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.697
-[buzzer sounds]
-[all applaud]

38:02.780 --> 38:04.323
[laughing]

38:04.407 --> 38:05.866
[Justin] Sara and Rodolfo.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.078
[Sara] Let us introduce you
to Howie the Howitzer.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.538
[Justin] Bring it on.

38:10.621 --> 38:13.291
[Sara] Yes, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.625
Go, go, go, go!

38:14.709 --> 38:17.044
-[cannon pops]
-[Justin] Oh, my God.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.629
-Scared me!
-[cannon pops]

38:19.547 --> 38:21.007
-Good job, Howie!
-Every time.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.967
[all cheering, then groaning]

38:23.050 --> 38:24.969
-[gasps, then laughs]
-[Justin groans]

38:25.052 --> 38:26.470
Let's see that again in slo-mo.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.681
-[all groan]
-[gasps]

38:29.432 --> 38:31.684
-[Sara groans]
-[Andrew] Oh! [laughs]

38:31.767 --> 38:32.643
Ooh!

38:32.727 --> 38:33.769
Oh.

38:33.853 --> 38:34.687
[Sara] Okay.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.732
-Oh, no!
-[all groan]

38:40.067 --> 38:41.277
[dramatic music playing]

38:42.903 --> 38:46.866
Now, bakineers,
unfortunately, you failed the stress test.

38:46.949 --> 38:50.745
But, luckily, you've saved some desserts
in case your bots crashed.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.539
Let's just hope
they are good enough to save you.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.166
Steve and Renee.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.962
Pastry chef to pastry chef,
this is an exquisite dessert.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.464
-Thank you.
-[Joanne] Nice job.

39:01.547 --> 39:03.799
Thinking from
these two disciplines, Steve,

39:03.883 --> 39:06.302
we know you're an amazing chocolatier,

39:06.385 --> 39:09.472
but, clearly, as an engineering material,
it can be very heavy.

39:09.555 --> 39:13.851
And, Renee, I think perhaps you could've--
Do a weight test earlier on.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.021
[Justin] Sara, Rodolfo.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.523
[Rodolfo] So, it's a pate a choux
with a salted caramel

39:19.607 --> 39:20.775
and pastry cream.

39:20.858 --> 39:21.692
Here we go.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.322
I love this filling.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.657
It's creamy, it's a little salty,

39:28.741 --> 39:32.536
the choux are delicate,
and it was a stunning presentation.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.454
Thank you.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.706
From a bakineering point of view,
I enjoyed

39:35.790 --> 39:39.668
you using that kind of pancake camouflage.
I thought that was ingenious.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.588
But all your edible parts
weren't adhered well enough,

39:42.671 --> 39:44.799
so everything just fell apart.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.928
[Justin] Joey, Mario.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.516
The peanut butter mousse
and the chocolate pudding

39:53.599 --> 39:54.475
are well done.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.936
-[Joey] Mm-hmm.
-[Joanne] The center is gooey,

39:57.019 --> 39:58.854
-as we requested.
-[Joey] Mm-hmm.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.898
The cake is a little bit dry.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.444
I had a lot of doubts about it.

40:05.528 --> 40:09.532
The first doubt that I had
was that heavy weight on the top.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.992
I feared exactly what happened to it.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.786
It fell right on its face.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.289
Cindy and Taylor.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.878
[Taylor] This is our friend Walter.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.798
At the top,
we've got a mix of modeling chocolate

40:25.881 --> 40:28.467
and fondant and isomalt for decor.

40:28.551 --> 40:32.054
We have a full-size watermelon,
which holds all the electronics,

40:32.138 --> 40:34.932
as well as the pastry
that Cindy put together.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.309
-Ta-da.
-[Cindy giggles]

40:37.393 --> 40:40.020
Cindy, Taylor, is Walter ready to race?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.021
-Yep.
-Yes.

40:41.522 --> 40:45.359
Let the race begin in three, two, one.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.236
-Go.
-[tense music playing]

40:51.031 --> 40:53.075
-Walter.
-[Justin] Wow, Walter!

40:53.159 --> 40:55.536
Through the candy-cane figure-eights.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.955
Candy-cane figure-eights no problem.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.583
Effortlessly approaching Candy Mountain.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.668
Oh. No sweat.

41:02.751 --> 41:03.961
[cannon pops]

41:04.044 --> 41:06.755
-Ooh!
-[Justin] Walter did not flinch.

41:06.839 --> 41:07.923
Walter did leak

41:08.007 --> 41:10.217
-a little juice there, I think.
-[all chuckle]

41:10.301 --> 41:13.637
[Justin] All right.
Approaching the marshmallow.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.931
Hello. The Winter Wonderland.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.475
-Whoa!
-[all exclaim]

41:17.558 --> 41:18.476
[laughs]

41:18.559 --> 41:20.978
-[shrieks]
-Just effortless!

41:22.771 --> 41:26.150
Now, hopefully, he'll make it through.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.279
[all exclaim]

41:31.530 --> 41:33.115
[Justin] Little bump on the tail there.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.618
Oh, boy.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.579
-Walter's--
-[all exclaim, then cheer]

41:38.662 --> 41:39.705
[Justin] Here goes.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.333
[contestants applauding]

41:42.416 --> 41:44.376
[Justin] Up the ramp!

41:46.170 --> 41:48.214
-Down the finish line!
-[Cindy laughing]

41:48.297 --> 41:50.341
[all cheering, applauding]

41:50.424 --> 41:51.717
[upbeat music playing]

41:55.930 --> 41:56.889
[Justin] Wow!

41:58.557 --> 42:00.476
Let's eat this dude's heart.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.649
-[Andrew] Thank you.
-It is a heart.

42:07.233 --> 42:11.195
[Cindy] Inside Walter's heart
is heart-shaped pate a choux pastries

42:11.278 --> 42:12.446
with a craquelin topping.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.949
On one side is
a strawberry-watermelon cream,

42:15.032 --> 42:16.951
and on the other is a basil-infused cream.

42:17.034 --> 42:21.622
The watermelon isn't meant to be
a full-on flavor, but a note on your nose,

42:21.705 --> 42:24.625
as well as the basil,
and then the strawberry brightens it up.

42:24.708 --> 42:28.170
Cindy, you've done a really lovely job
with this pate a choux.

42:28.254 --> 42:31.173
The craquelin topping
makes it nice and crispy on top.

42:31.257 --> 42:34.552
The creams are really well-flavored.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.845
It did get soggy underneath.

42:36.929 --> 42:40.808
I think sitting in the watermelon,
it's a little bit of a humid environment

42:40.891 --> 42:43.352
that may have compromised the texture
on the bottom.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.774
Cindy and Taylor, I loved everything
about the engineering of your design.

42:48.857 --> 42:52.820
Instead of making a robot
that was robust, or fast, or agile,

42:52.903 --> 42:55.155
you went for all of the above.

42:55.239 --> 42:58.200
Your robot made it
through that course like it was nothing.

42:58.284 --> 42:59.326
Congratulations.

42:59.410 --> 43:00.703
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks.

43:00.786 --> 43:03.539
I think you've got the smarts
to think of something edible

43:03.622 --> 43:05.958
to connect that head to that body,
instead of twine.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.668
I think there were solutions there,

43:07.751 --> 43:10.004
but I think what you've done today
is ingenious.

43:10.629 --> 43:11.505
Thank you.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.966
Cindy, Taylor. Well done. Congrats.

43:14.049 --> 43:15.384
-Thank you.
-Thank you, guys.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.510
Good job.

43:19.346 --> 43:22.099
Judges. I bet you have a lot to discuss.

43:22.182 --> 43:25.561
Leave you to it. I'll hang with the
bakineers. We'll check in with you soon.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.187
[dramatic music playing]

43:31.692 --> 43:35.863
It's not easy to bring an engineer
into pastry and pastry into engineering.

43:35.946 --> 43:38.407
We got so far
in putting the thing together.

43:38.490 --> 43:41.493
We have a really good product,
and then for it not to move,

43:41.577 --> 43:44.163
that was extremely disappointing.

43:44.872 --> 43:48.542
I think it's very possible
that we could be going home from this.

43:50.544 --> 43:51.629
[tense music playing]

43:59.178 --> 44:02.389
Bakineers, this is Baking Impossible,

44:02.473 --> 44:06.226
and this challenge really stressed
the important part of that, didn't it?

44:06.310 --> 44:09.980
Not many of your robots made it
through our stress test intact.

44:10.648 --> 44:14.610
And trust me, things are only going to get
more challenging as we move forward.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.405
By now, you know how this works.

44:19.073 --> 44:22.910
You get a pass or a fail from each of us
from our respective fields.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.454
But only one team can win this mission

44:25.537 --> 44:28.415
and earn some much-needed help
in the very next one.

44:28.999 --> 44:33.128
And, of course, one team's time
in the workshop will end today.

44:36.799 --> 44:41.261
Nina and Hannah, Vanessa and Shanice.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.722
Unfortunately,
one of you will be heading home.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.602
Judges, it's a difficult decision, I know.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.563
But which team of bakineers is it?

44:57.528 --> 44:58.904
Nina and Hannah.

45:01.156 --> 45:03.158
This has been your final mission.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.285
[poignant music playing]

45:08.414 --> 45:09.456
Nina and Hannah,

45:10.290 --> 45:13.711
your robot didn't perform well enough
to keep you in the competition.

45:13.794 --> 45:17.005
Also, we think you could have been
more ambitious with your dessert.

45:17.089 --> 45:21.552
Unfortunately, your grandma's cookies
weren't enough to save you this mission.

45:22.803 --> 45:26.181
Nina and Hannah, thank you guys so much.
Give it up for Nina and Hannah, everybody.

45:26.265 --> 45:27.683
[all applauding]

45:29.643 --> 45:32.020
[Hannah] I'm not happy to be going home,

45:32.104 --> 45:33.564
but, at the same time,

45:33.647 --> 45:37.151
I've learned a lot.
I'm not walking away empty-handed.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.778
[Nina] This is such a great competition.

45:39.862 --> 45:43.073
I am taking away
lots of friends and memories,

45:43.657 --> 45:47.244
and I can't wait to see
what the other teams get to build.

45:51.039 --> 45:55.377
Vanessa and Shanice, you are safe.
You'll be moving on to the next mission.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.588
Brandi and Menuka.

45:58.213 --> 46:01.467
Cindy and Taylor. Congratulations.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.845
You are the top two teams
for this mission.

46:05.554 --> 46:10.726
The winning team is going to be revealed

46:11.310 --> 46:13.604
by my little robot friend here.

46:13.687 --> 46:15.856
-[robot whirring]
-[Rodolfo chuckles]

46:15.939 --> 46:18.901
-[Justin] Hey, dude.
-He's so cute.

46:18.984 --> 46:20.569
-Okay.
-[all chuckle]

46:20.652 --> 46:21.487
Yeah.

46:21.570 --> 46:23.447
-[chuckles]
-[Justin sighs]

46:25.115 --> 46:27.201
-[Justin] He's cute.
-He is cute.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.494
[upbeat music playing]

46:30.996 --> 46:32.206
[Justin] Cindy and Taylor.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.749
[all applauding]

46:38.003 --> 46:40.714
Cindy and Taylor,
we loved Walter the robot.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.300
It exemplified everything
we want to see in bakineering.

46:43.383 --> 46:46.512
Clever use of the edible.
It was neat as a pin,

46:46.595 --> 46:49.014
and you completed the course
in the fastest time.

46:49.097 --> 46:51.725
Walter was engineered to a tee

46:51.809 --> 46:53.268
and crushed that course.

46:53.352 --> 46:57.064
I love what you guys did.
Keep up the good work going forward.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.482
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

46:59.024 --> 47:03.278
You guys had passes from all of our judges
and you will earn an incredible advantage

47:03.362 --> 47:06.031
in the next mission.
And now you have some souvenirs.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.410
Judges, what do you say?
Should one thing lead to another?

47:10.494 --> 47:12.371
-That leads to another.
-And another.

47:12.454 --> 47:13.372
And another.

47:13.455 --> 47:15.874
Which then causes me to do this.

47:16.834 --> 47:21.964
