00:01.160 --> 00:02.161
NARRATOR: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars.

00:02.930 --> 00:04.625
I want some of
your study aid--

00:04.670 --> 00:06.365
the kind with
the childproof cap.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.560
It looks like
you haven't been sleeping.

00:07.600 --> 00:08.635
I just really
have a headache.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.137
And you're lying again.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.660
I'm visiting my dad.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.268
He's lecturing
in Syracuse.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.505
We could have this place.
It could be our secret.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.802
I'm tired of lying.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.101
It belongs to Alison.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.549
Alison's running out of money,

00:19.580 --> 00:21.309
and Shana's the only one
who knows how to reach her.

00:21.350 --> 00:24.410
One of_Ali_son:s stories _
kept on sticking In my brain.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.486
It's The Hart and Huntsman,
where Alison's mystery man

00:26.520 --> 00:27.282
took her for pine beer.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.254
I went to
The Hart and Huntsman

00:29.290 --> 00:31.121
and E_zra was there
eatIng the pIe.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.627
The pie and the beer!
Board Shorts Ale!

00:32.660 --> 00:35.128
You think he's "A"?
We have to call Aria.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.388
I don't think
we should tell her

00:36.430 --> 00:37.397
until we're
a hundred percent sure.

00:37.430 --> 00:38.260
You wanted to see me?

00:38.300 --> 00:41.167
Please, come in.
And, uh, close the door.

00:54.850 --> 00:57.580
How many Goldstick
Variations are there?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.781
Thirty-two.
They'll never miss us.

00:59.820 --> 01:01.412
Aria still isn't answering.

01:01.460 --> 01:02.620
What are you gonna say
if we get her?

01:02.660 --> 01:04.548
Isn't it funny
how your old boyfriend

01:04.590 --> 01:06.421
turned out to be
a stalking whackjob?"

01:06.460 --> 01:08.451
I'd like to know a lot
more before we talk to her.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.489
You take that side
of the desk,

01:09.530 --> 01:10.565
you take the file cabinet.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.794
What are we looking for?
Evidence.

01:11.830 --> 01:14.196
We're gonna need a lot more
if we're going to prove to Aria

01:14.240 --> 01:15.434
that Ezra's...

01:15.470 --> 01:16.630
not who he says he is.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.365
That he's "A."

01:18.410 --> 01:19.570
How are we going
to convince Aria

01:19.610 --> 01:20.702
if we can't even
say It out loud?

01:29.720 --> 01:31.210
If I was a teacher
and my students

01:31.250 --> 01:32.012
only got me coffee mugs,

01:32.050 --> 01:34.484
I would so start
flunking people.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.754
Tell me that's what
it looks like?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.499
Ali's journal.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.774
So that was Ezra
at the cabin?

01:52.810 --> 01:54.801
We always knew
there were two of them.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.875
Ezra and Shana?

01:55.910 --> 01:57.798
Ezra and somebody.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.536
What is Mona doing here?

02:19.570 --> 02:20.639
I don't know.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.739
Is she looking for the book?

02:21.770 --> 02:23.658
How should I know?
QUIet.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.212
Why is Mona stealing
papers from Mr. Fitz?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.511
Maybe she isn't
stealing them.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.221
Maybe she's
delivering them.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.926
Shouldn't we do this
In your room?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.689
My parents are out
of town, being lavwers.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.595
Sounds romantic.

02:49.630 --> 02:52.793
One's in Chicago,
the other one's in Boston.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.866
I don't think there are
any pages missing.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.334
Okay, are you, like,
getting a cold?

02:58.370 --> 03:01.601
Allergies.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.403
What about the phone number
and email addresses

03:03.450 --> 03:04.906
I found with the money?

03:04.950 --> 03:06.679
I have a reverse directory
for that phone number.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.870
We can send emails
to those addresses,

03:08.920 --> 03:13.289
but we should do it from
someplace that can't be traced.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.288
What do we know
about Shana?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.686
That she's missing.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.322
No, I mean, really.
What do we know?

03:19.360 --> 03:22.363
She was with Paige.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.890
Can we please
not go there.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.966
I'm just saying, we don't
have a lot of details
about that.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.436
Not those kind of details.
I mean,

03:29.470 --> 03:31.438
did Shana ever mention
anything about Georgia,

03:31.470 --> 03:33.904
something that connects
with where Ali's hiding?

03:33.940 --> 03:35.601
I thought you didn't
want us looking for Ali.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.575
I think "A" changed
the rules on that.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.316
I'm in the same place
Emily is--

03:40.350 --> 03:42.580
I'm more angry
than I am scared.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.609
What do
you want me to do?

03:43.650 --> 03:45.789
Interrogate my girlfriend
about her summer fling?

03:45.820 --> 03:47.310
Basically.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.328
Isn't there some sort
of Mona-Fitz connection

03:49.360 --> 03:50.520
we should be
worrying about?

03:50.560 --> 03:53.393
I cannot worry
about anything else.
My brain is full.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.489
So's mine.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.794
We'll tag up on this later.
Aria should be back by then.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.005
What?

04:04.440 --> 04:05.600
Did it ever occur
to you guys

04:05.640 --> 04:07.801
that we found that book
awfully easy?

04:07.840 --> 04:09.774
What are you thinking?

04:09.810 --> 04:11.368
I'm thinking
what if it wasn't "A"

04:11.410 --> 04:12.479
who put that book
in the desk?

04:12.520 --> 04:16.616
Em, get real, this is all
about the A-ness of things.

04:16.650 --> 04:21.349
I might have not said like
that, but Hanna's right.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.926
I love
when you say that.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.758
What are you thinking?

04:37.370 --> 04:39.031
You don't want to know.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.573
Try me.

04:41.610 --> 04:44.647
I'm thinking
it's Sunday night

04:44.680 --> 04:46.375
and I still have
a lot of homework to do.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.411
Creative writing homework?

04:48.450 --> 04:51.647
Okay, you're gonna like
this one when I'm done.

04:51.690 --> 04:52.884
It started _out
as one thing

04:52.920 --> 04:55.753
and then it just
turned into something
completely different.

04:55.790 --> 04:58.554
How'd that happen?

04:58.590 --> 05:03.493
I had this hero, but heroes
aren't what they used to be

05:03.530 --> 05:05.896
so I got fascinated
with a villain.

05:07.870 --> 05:11.328
Does your villain
lose in the end?

05:11.370 --> 05:12.974
I'm not sure.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.343
Sometimes the villain wins.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.439
Sometimes.

06:09.730 --> 06:12.733
"Down these mean streets
a man must go

06:12.770 --> 06:15.739
who is not himself mean."

07:07.820 --> 07:11.051
TOBY: You've been
holding out on me.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.789
Toby?

07:17.800 --> 07:19.563
I wouldn't say no
to a drink.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.203
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

07:26.240 --> 07:28.879
* Swear this one
you'll save *

07:28.910 --> 07:31.470
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

07:31.510 --> 07:33.978
* Taking this one
to the grave *

07:34.020 --> 07:38.912
* IfI show you then I know
you Won't tell what I said *

07:38.950 --> 07:43.785
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
If one of them is dead *

07:47.800 --> 07:49.119
I need to know
what you know.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.696
About what?

07:50.730 --> 07:51.822
About Alison.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.030
How am I supposed
to help you

07:53.070 --> 07:54.162
if you won't level with me?

07:54.200 --> 07:56.760
I don't know what you mean.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.766
You know exactly
what I mean.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.835
This started out
as a job.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.507
It's something else now,
and you know it.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.172
You're just going
to have to trust me.

08:06.210 --> 08:08.110
Trust you?

08:08.150 --> 08:10.789
You're spread so thin,
I can see right through you.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.811
There's nothing
wrong with me.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.918
They help me focus.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.019
That's all they do.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.492
Who's kidding who?

08:34.780 --> 08:35.804
Thanks.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.241
Here, Let me
get that for you.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.043
I can pay
for my own coffee.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.945
It's fifteen cents.
I'm good for it.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.184
Keep the change, hon.

08:47.790 --> 08:48.757
Thanks.

08:48.790 --> 08:49.950
Tell you the truth,

08:49.990 --> 08:52.185
that's kind of my way
of saying sorry.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.221
For what?

08:54.260 --> 08:56.125
I don't like the way
our conversation
went the other day.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.219
I don't think it helped
either one of us.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.103
Yeah, well,
sometimes I have trouble

09:03.140 --> 09:05.802
taking constructive criticism.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.273
I perceive it as a threat.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.778
I'm the same way.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.711
Have you been back
to The Hart and Huntsman?

09:12.750 --> 09:14.274
No, not since
I saw you there.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.811
Maybe I can buy you
lunch sometime.

09:16.850 --> 09:17.987
Or dinner.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.284
Maybe.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.185
Well, let me know
what's good for you.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.323
I will.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.759
Promise?

09:24.790 --> 09:26.929
Promise.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.089
Cross your heart
and hope to die?

09:41.410 --> 09:45.073
The more I see of men,
the more I want to get a dog.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.317
Too bad there isn't
another alternative.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.215
Too bad.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.741
So he just paid
for your cup of coffee?

09:51.790 --> 09:54.213
Left a ten-cent tip.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.148
On a cup of coffee?
What a waste.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.829
Glad Aria's
done with him.
Is she?

09:58.860 --> 10:01.351
You think
she started up with Ezra
and didn't tell us?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.221
Show of hands:
Who hasn't lied about

10:04.270 --> 10:06.022
something romantic
to the rest of the group?

10:08.070 --> 10:09.708
I rest my case.

10:09.740 --> 10:10.968
What do we do?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.378
You're President
of the Man-Haters Club,

10:15.410 --> 10:17.970
how would you feel about
keeping an eye on Ezra Fitz?

10:18.010 --> 10:20.274
I was born for the job.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.989
Morning, troops.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.009
Hey.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.711
Aria.
How was Syracuse?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.079
Oh, it was fine.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.719
You have a good time
with your dad?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.921
Yeah, real good time.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.760
Did you make it down
to The Erie Canal Museum?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.803
Ah, it was closed.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.398
Too bad.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.738
So, what did I miss
around here?

10:47.780 --> 10:50.772
Nothing much.

10:50.810 --> 10:51.902
( bell rings )

10:51.950 --> 10:54.748
Well, It's time to go wrestle
the world to its knees.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.083
You really have been
to The Erie Canal Museum,
haven't you?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.781
Twice.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.869
WOMAN: (on phone)
Fitzgerald Art Foundation.

11:12.900 --> 11:16.165
Is this EDgewood 5-0139?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.760
Yes, it is.

11:18.810 --> 11:21.370
And you said
Fitzgerald Art Foundation?

11:21.410 --> 11:22.707
Yes, ma'am.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.877
To whom do you wish
to speak?

11:41.760 --> 11:45.025
I thought you were gonna
go easy on that stuff.

11:45.070 --> 11:47.334
Haven't you ever heard
of knocking before
you come in a room?

11:47.370 --> 11:48.894
I've heard of it,

11:48.940 --> 11:51.261
I just don't subscribe
to the practice.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.199
You learn a lot more
walkIng In unInVIted.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.434
Those pills.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.801
They're not going
to help you figure this out.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.739
You've already got
most of the pieces.

12:00.780 --> 12:05.240
Suppose you tell me how
everything fits together.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.484
I thought you were
the smart one.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.818
I am the smart one.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.426
When did that get here?

12:17.870 --> 12:19.462
I have no idea.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.831
All those pills, Spencer.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.235
Notgood.

12:27.410 --> 12:29.378
Almost looks like
she could step

12:29.410 --> 12:31.844
right out of the frame
and kiss you.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.747
Or laugh in your face.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.978
Suppose she did?

12:39.020 --> 12:41.011
Step out of that
painting.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.483
Suppose she was alive,
somewhere?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.894
You trying
to tell me something?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.128
Just asking.

12:50.170 --> 12:54.038
Not much chance
of that, is there?

13:04.180 --> 13:08.446
( music playing )

13:42.080 --> 13:45.140
Men.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.399
( piano music playing )

14:19.990 --> 14:22.515
Why are you asking me
about Shana now?

14:22.560 --> 14:25.051
That was a long time ago.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.523
Not that long.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.221
I told you
what happened.

14:28.260 --> 14:30.490
I'm sorry about
what happened.

14:30.530 --> 14:33.090
I'm not asking you
to apologize.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.937
Then why are you
asking me about her?

14:40.380 --> 14:44.100
I thought about you
when I was with her.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.004
I can't believe
I just said that.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.178
That's what a boy says
when he cheats.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.482
I feel almost normal.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.267
Maybe I should go.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.267
I'll go first.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.995
I don't mind.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.601
You always leave first.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.665
Aren't you afraid people
will notice that, too?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.701
I have to leave first.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.298
Why?

15:16.340 --> 15:19.605
Because I can't stand to see
you walk away from me.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.454
Will I see you later?

15:28.690 --> 15:29.987
I don't know.

16:37.190 --> 16:38.987
Lose something, honey?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.494
( telephone ringing )

16:46.800 --> 16:48.097
Hello?

16:48.140 --> 16:50.404
There's a blonde package
waiting for you.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.307
Apartment 3B.
You know the address.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.568
Mona?

16:54.610 --> 16:58.546
Better hurry up, while
she's still breathing.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.467
You all right?

17:19.500 --> 17:20.694
Never better.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.406
When you put a tail
on somebody,

17:25.440 --> 17:27.169
you shouldn't trust it
to an amateur.

17:27.210 --> 17:29.337
I'm not as used to walking
the streets as Mona is.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.405
Come over here
and say that.

17:31.450 --> 17:34.977
Mona, how about fixing
our guests a drink?

17:38.850 --> 17:42.149
My own juice blend.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.680
Made me what I am today.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.459
I thought you only drank
Board Shorts Ale.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.321
When I can get it.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.561
You thirsty?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.227
Not especially.

17:52.270 --> 17:55.831
Then let's blow.
SUIts me.

17:55.870 --> 17:58.168
How come you had this one
to camp out on my doorstep?

17:58.210 --> 17:59.837
You piqued my interest.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.475
About what?
You and Aria.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.649
What about me and Aria?
Are you back together?

18:04.680 --> 18:07.513
True love honey,
just can't kill it.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.642
Nix.

18:10.550 --> 18:13.314
I'm only going
to tell you this once.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.554
Leave Aria alone.

18:14.590 --> 18:17.286
If that's what you want,
why don't you just
tell her about me?

18:17.330 --> 18:19.218
Tell her
who you think I am.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.194
That should fix
everything, right?

18:21.230 --> 18:22.857
But you haven't.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.367
Why not?

18:26.470 --> 18:27.596
Spencer, let's go.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.268
I'll tell you why not
if you want me to.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.164
It's that you're not sure.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.336
You're not sure
about anythIng.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.779
You're in over your head
and you know it.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.505
I know what I'm doing.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.905
Really?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.542
Look around you,
Spencen

18:39.580 --> 18:42.140
Look at_where
you are rIght now

18:42.180 --> 18:43.647
and tell me
you're not crackIng up.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.326
Let 'em go.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.297
Thanks for the buffet.

19:03.870 --> 19:07.874
I want you to know,
that was the last carrot stick.

19:15.950 --> 19:19.818
( music plays )

19:19.850 --> 19:22.216
What is it with men?

19:22.260 --> 19:23.784
Why do they always
turn on you?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.650
Not all of them.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.248
Is it because
they wear hats

19:27.300 --> 19:28.528
and the blood gets
stuck in their heads?

19:28.560 --> 19:30.892
I don't know.

19:30.930 --> 19:35.663
( music continues )

19:35.700 --> 19:37.531
You know, I heard
that's what causes baldness.

19:37.570 --> 19:38.798
Hanna, not helping.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.637
Well, I got you out of
that apartment, didn't I?

19:40.680 --> 19:44.309
Yeah, you did.
Thanks.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.705
Some rescue team
I am.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.670
Are you okay?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.449
I will be.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.280
I traced that number
on Ali's list.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.925
It's the Fitzgerald
Art Foundation.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.951
Fitzgerald as in Fitz?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.753
That's right.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.394
And you think
Ali called that number.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.967
Well, I figure, you're the one
who works at the switchboard.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.433
You could be the one
to find out.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.474
( camera click)

20:15.510 --> 20:16.875
So when you're done
with the roll

20:16.910 --> 20:18.309
you take it
to the drugstore

20:18.350 --> 20:20.875
and a week later
you pick up your pictures.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.309
That's great.
Thanks.

20:23.350 --> 20:24.817
Where you going?

20:24.850 --> 20:27.580
Delaware Water Gap.
Canoe trip.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.451
Oh, by yourself?

20:29.490 --> 20:31.822
No, not alone.

20:31.860 --> 20:32.849
Emily said she'd come.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.654
Emily?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.463
I don't think of her
as a tomboy.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.821
SheisnT.

20:39.870 --> 20:40.996
I used to be
a real tomboy.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.804
I would spend more time
in the tree in our front yard

20:43.840 --> 20:46.001
_ than I would
In my own bedroom.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.679
What changed?
I don't know.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.738
Yes, I do.

20:54.780 --> 20:56.611
I fell in love
for the first time.

20:56.650 --> 21:01.656
That's when I lost all my
interest in tree climbing.

21:01.690 --> 21:04.386
I guess you just
grow out of it.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.648
That's what they say.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.729
I'll tell you what I know
about people.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.304
They're no damn good.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.375
Everybody's out
for themselves.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.049
That's the simple truth.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.015
If I'm no damn good,
why are you talking to me?

21:32.050 --> 21:34.518
Because _we have
somethIng In common.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.310
We both know
what happens

21:35.360 --> 21:36.918
when a man
lets a skirt get to him.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.383
He makes mistakes.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.398
Walks into trouble
with his eyes wide open

21:41.430 --> 21:43.318
and ends up in trouble
all by himself.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.365
I have some information
that might help you
with all that trouble.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.401
What's this information
gonna cost me?

21:52.440 --> 21:55.830
Consider it a gift, from one
lodge brother to another.

21:58.980 --> 22:02.541
Alison DiLaurentis is alive.

22:02.580 --> 22:05.083
And Spencer Hastings
knows how to find her.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.816
Alison DiLaurentis is dead.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.680
Says who?

22:25.870 --> 22:30.500
It's a good likeness,
don't you think?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.007
He did a wonderful job.

22:33.050 --> 22:35.871
I should have been
nicer to him.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.615
Ali.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.881
Why didn't you tell us
about Ezra Fitz?

22:44.930 --> 22:49.856
It makes me angry
though, the portrait.

22:49.900 --> 22:53.939
It'll always look like that,
but I won't.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.609
That's why it's smart
to disappear,

23:02.180 --> 23:05.479
That is immortality,
my darling.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.614
Were you watching?

23:07.650 --> 23:08.947
Did you see him
go after her?

23:08.980 --> 23:10.447
Why didn't you warn Aria?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.139
No woman has ever been able

23:12.190 --> 23:14.055
to warn another woman
about a man.

23:14.090 --> 23:15.785
Is he who you're afraid of?

23:15.820 --> 23:18.425
Is that why
you can't come back?

23:18.460 --> 23:20.928
Can I get one straight answer
from you about anything?

23:20.960 --> 23:23.758
And what would be
the fun of that?

23:23.800 --> 23:26.018
I swear, if you don't
stop it right now...

23:26.070 --> 23:28.732
That is a scary look,
Spencen

23:28.770 --> 23:30.635
Maybe you should be
the one I'm afraid of.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.500
I'm just trying
to figure this out.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.646
You have all the pieces.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.047
So why can't you
put them together?

23:43.080 --> 23:46.083
Maybe you need a little more
help from those special pills.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.587
Do you have enough?

23:47.620 --> 23:49.815
And what happens
if you run out?

24:12.110 --> 24:13.577
No!

24:13.620 --> 24:14.939
Snap out of it!

24:14.980 --> 24:16.675
Look!

24:37.200 --> 24:39.009
Sit down.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.942
Is Alison alive or dead?

24:45.980 --> 24:48.710
She's dead.
Everybody knows that.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.581
That's not
what you said before.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.609
I was confused.

24:51.650 --> 24:53.618
Confused about her
being dead

24:53.660 --> 24:55.252
or confused about
telling me the truth?

24:55.290 --> 24:57.588
Just confused.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.689
Spencer doesn't
get confused.

24:59.730 --> 25:02.551
Spencer's the smart one.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.522
Maybe smart enough
to get away with murder.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.265
Maybe.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.528
Or maybe
smart enough

25:07.570 --> 25:10.164
to help Ali
fake the whole thing.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.260
Or maybe she tricked you
into helping.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.676
You ever consider that?

25:23.590 --> 25:25.546
I always thought champagne
was the most

25:25.590 --> 25:27.046
sophisticated thing
in the world.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.614
Well, it isn't.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.184
You are.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.221
( languid music playing
on radio )

25:37.930 --> 25:40.660
I want to tell my friends,
about us.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.931
That's a big secret.

25:46.970 --> 25:48.176
You're sure,
you can trust them?

25:48.210 --> 25:50.178
I trust them with my life.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.199
I have.

25:52.780 --> 25:53.815
Do they trust you?

25:53.850 --> 25:56.171
What do you mean?

25:56.220 --> 25:57.744
I mean, you want them
to know everything about us,

25:57.790 --> 26:00.987
but do you know
everything about them?

26:01.020 --> 26:03.557
Do you know
all their secrets?

26:04.830 --> 26:05.854
The important ones.

26:08.630 --> 26:11.098
I bet you...

26:11.130 --> 26:14.998
I know one of your secrets.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.860
I bet you don't.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.678
Alison's alive.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.279
MAN: I'm looking
for Mr. Willeken.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.710
Just one moment.
I'll connect you.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.968
WOMAN: Can you put through
Mr. Kane on LOckwood-3?

26:30.020 --> 26:33.114
Just one moment,
I'll connect you
to your party.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.213
Listen, Mabel,
I'm trying to track down

26:37.260 --> 26:39.683
one crummy phone number.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.823
How many favors
have I done for you?

26:41.860 --> 26:44.397
Remember those
three saI|ors?

26:44.430 --> 26:45.863
All right.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.289
So a place like this
Fitzgerald outfit,

26:48.340 --> 26:50.069
they send
all their night calls

26:50.100 --> 26:51.704
to an answering service.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.274
Terrific.

26:55.310 --> 26:56.709
Call me back.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.276
WOMAN: Hello.

26:58.310 --> 27:01.211
Just one moment,
I'll connect you to
the long-distance operator.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.350
So many people in this city.

27:09.390 --> 27:12.279
Why does it feel so lonely?

27:23.470 --> 27:25.301
Are you afraid
of being lonely?

27:27.310 --> 27:29.039
I'm afraid
of being alone.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.269
I won't let that happen.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.919
I'm scared.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.651
Me, too.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.288
What if people find out?

27:46.330 --> 27:51.029
Then they will be
insanely jealous of me.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.929
Of me.

27:53.970 --> 27:56.768
Of us.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.192
All-Night
Answering Service?

28:27.230 --> 28:28.333
WOMAN: Yes, it is.

28:28.370 --> 28:30.338
You can really
save my neck.

28:30.370 --> 28:31.735
My boss is
Mr. Fitzgerald,

28:31.770 --> 28:33.931
and I lost a very important
phone number.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.277
Okay.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.369
This is from somebody
who called after hours

28:37.410 --> 28:39.401
and I hope you kept
a copy of that message.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.747
Maybe.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.441
It'd be from Alison.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.084
Could you check that for me?

28:44.120 --> 28:45.485
Hold just a sec.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.852
Sure, 1'” hold.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.081
Secrets aren't just secrets.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.927
They're weapons.

28:54.960 --> 28:59.067
Things you keep in you
pocket till you need them.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.933
I learned that from Ali.

29:01.970 --> 29:04.131
You learned the same thing.

29:04.170 --> 29:08.334
I know something else.

29:08.380 --> 29:12.100
"A" didn't just come out
of the woodwork.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.472
A monster like that,
you have to take care of it,

29:15.520 --> 29:17.784
nurture it.

29:17.820 --> 29:20.345
And that's just
what Ali did.

29:20.390 --> 29:23.052
She was feeding the beast
with every dirty trick,

29:23.090 --> 29:26.526
every lie
she got us to tell.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.028
It all made
"A" stronger.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.530
You know who "A" is.

29:35.570 --> 29:36.935
I'm not so sure anymore.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.360
First it was Mona,
then it wasn't.

29:40.410 --> 29:42.878
Maybe I know or maybe
I'm just looking
into another mask.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.049
Ali is alive.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.308
Who told you that?

29:47.350 --> 29:48.840
Never mind.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.916
She's alive and you know
how to find her.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.042
No, I don't.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.489
Maybe you don't
have the exact address,

29:53.520 --> 29:55.056
but you know
the next step.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.409
I've got nothing.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.327
All I've got is a book
filled with cruel stories

29:59.360 --> 30:01.294
and fake names
and bad poetry.

30:01.330 --> 30:03.195
That's right,
you've got the book.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.595
And why do you
suppose that is?

30:04.630 --> 30:08.339
Since when does the devil
gIve out free samples?

30:12.270 --> 30:13.305
Think about it.

30:13.340 --> 30:16.036
I don't want
to think about it.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.379
I'm so tired of thinking.
I just want to sleep.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.596
"Down these mean streets
a gIrl must go

30:35.630 --> 30:38.326
who is not herself mean."

30:42.100 --> 30:44.830
( soulful vocal music
Playing )

31:00.390 --> 31:02.255
Hello.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.518
Hi.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.851
You all right?

31:09.960 --> 31:11.222
If I tell you something,

31:11.270 --> 31:12.623
you promise me you won't
give me the look?

31:12.670 --> 31:14.490
What look?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.929
The Spencer look.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.938
The look that
you gIve everyone

31:18.970 --> 31:21.200
when you're really
disappointed in them.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.602
I didn't know I had
an official look for that.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.277
Oh, you do.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.278
I'll try.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.485
I've been seeing Ezra again.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.978
Really seeing him,
if you know what I mean.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.588
I think so.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.222
You said it yourself.

31:42.260 --> 31:46.697
I liked Jake,
but I love Ezra.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.391
I do love Ezra.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.260
Who are you trying
to convince?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.403
Well, everything that's
happened with him and me,

31:54.440 --> 31:56.533
I don't feel like it's
ever happened to anyone
else before.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.048
And it probably wouldn't
have happened to me

31:59.080 --> 32:02.243
ifI hadn't walked through
that one door that one time.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.282
It all would have
been different.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.447
And who decides what door
you walk through, anyway?

32:06.490 --> 32:09.379
I wish I knew.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.685
It's been sexy
and dangerous and...

32:12.730 --> 32:15.290
awful and wonderful.

32:15.330 --> 32:18.094
It's like a story.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.621
It was perfect.

32:20.670 --> 32:23.298
"Was" perfect?

32:23.340 --> 32:26.537
You used the past tense.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.073
I think the story
is changing.

32:36.780 --> 32:41.479
Aria, there's something
that I have to tell you,

32:41.520 --> 32:44.125
but I'm afraid I'm going
to get a lot more from you

32:44.160 --> 32:45.559
than just a look.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.557
What is it?

32:50.360 --> 32:52.362
I've been leaving you
messages everywhere.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.469
What happened?

32:53.500 --> 32:55.161
I found Ali.

33:14.420 --> 33:15.648
Here?

33:15.690 --> 33:19.023
The calls came from here?

33:19.060 --> 33:20.652
That's not how
you spell "nightly."

33:22.400 --> 33:25.221
You think that
Alison's in there? Why?

33:25.270 --> 33:27.693
Because someone called
the number on that contact list

33:27.730 --> 33:29.334
from a pay phone
in this club.

33:29.370 --> 33:31.065
That's Alison.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.704
Hiding in plain sight
and doing three shows a night.

33:44.150 --> 33:45.481
It looks like somebody threw
a hand grenade

33:45.520 --> 33:47.249
into a room
full of Rockettes.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.508
This isn't right.
All can't be here.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.687
Well, this is where
the call came from.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.392
( bawdy music
and laughter)

34:08.280 --> 34:10.032
Did anybody see
you come in here?

34:12.710 --> 34:14.177
We don't think so.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.643
Then get the hell out.

34:16.680 --> 34:17.442
Ali...

34:17.480 --> 34:18.686
I told you not
to come look for me.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.259
Well, things have changed.

34:21.290 --> 34:24.623
Maybe for you,
but not for me.

34:24.660 --> 34:26.685
I mean, are you
trying to get me killed?

34:26.730 --> 34:28.493
This one already tried once.

34:28.530 --> 34:29.827
Don't talk to me
like that.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.260
Don't talk
to u like that.

34:34.140 --> 34:35.459
All we want you back.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.606
Are you sure about that?

34:38.640 --> 34:40.699
I bet this one would love it
if something happened to me.

34:40.740 --> 34:43.208
That way she wouldn't have
to worry about dropping down

34:43.240 --> 34:44.844
to second place
ifI came back.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.972
What is wrong with you?

34:46.010 --> 34:48.342
Aren't you sick and tired
of her ordering you around?

34:48.380 --> 34:52.248
You are way out of line.
Am I, Emily?
Am I really?

34:52.290 --> 34:54.258
Start thinking
for yourself,

34:54.290 --> 34:56.178
instead of letting Spencer
think for you.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.587
Well, maybe she's right.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.724
Maybe it's time we all start
thinking for ourselves.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.228
Let's see how long
you last out here without us.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.794
Spencer, what are
you talking about?

35:07.830 --> 35:10.628
You're setting us up
for something.

35:10.670 --> 35:13.707
I don't know what it is,
but it's a set-up.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.605
And we're supposed to be
some kind of decoy for you

35:15.640 --> 35:17.335
and take all the heat.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.769
But you only ever tell us
what you want us to know.

35:19.810 --> 35:23.439
It's always been
that way.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.708
And you're different?

35:24.750 --> 35:27.742
Yeah, I'm different.

35:29.490 --> 35:30.514
Has she told you?

35:32.660 --> 35:34.651
Told me what?

35:36.700 --> 35:37.792
Aria...

35:37.830 --> 35:38.899
( gunshot)

36:05.660 --> 36:07.525
ALI: Split up,
go different ways.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.551
Get whoever it is to follow us
so you can get away?

36:10.760 --> 36:13.627
Don't even think about it.

36:13.670 --> 36:16.639
Aria?
Are you in there?

36:16.670 --> 36:17.637
Aria?

36:17.670 --> 36:19.331
It's Ezra.
Don't answer.

36:19.370 --> 36:22.669
What are you talking
about? It's Ezra.

36:22.710 --> 36:23.836
Don't let him know
where we are.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.741
You better tell her.
Shut up, Ali.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.975
Who sharpened your
tongue, little girl?

36:30.020 --> 36:32.341
EZRA: It's safe.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.655
You can come out now.
I'll take care of you.

36:35.690 --> 36:37.180
Ezra!

36:42.360 --> 36:43.588
I don't know what they've
told you about me,

36:43.630 --> 36:45.598
but it's not true.

36:45.630 --> 36:46.961
You guys gonna tell her,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.638
or is that supposed
to be my job?

36:48.670 --> 36:49.989
Well, somebody better
tell me something.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.703
EZRA: I'll keep you safe Aria,
I promise.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.708
I love you.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.469
No one has ever
loved you the way I do.

36:59.950 --> 37:01.838
You can't trust him.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.212
Why?

37:06.920 --> 37:09.013
No guts.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.359
I thinkI liked you better
when you were dead.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.390
No.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.574
We don't have much time.

38:02.610 --> 38:05.272
I hit him hard,
but I only hit him once.

38:13.390 --> 38:14.459
Wait.
Where's Ali?

38:14.490 --> 38:16.515
She's gone.
Get in.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.549
Go.

38:49.690 --> 38:50.987
Why did Toby hit him?

39:00.130 --> 39:02.360
Ali was right.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.334
None of us
has any guts.

39:06.070 --> 39:07.935
You figure it out yet?

39:07.970 --> 39:09.904
I wish you'd stop
saying that.

39:09.940 --> 39:10.838
Have you?

39:10.880 --> 39:12.939
_ _ 'Cause this car
Is just about out of gas.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.470
So am I.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.873
I'm just so damn tired.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.911
We're all tired, Spencer.

39:17.950 --> 39:19.781
Figure it out, so we can
get on with our lives.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.981
No matter who gets hurt.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.955
You're all the time talking
about wanting the answer.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.719
Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

39:26.760 --> 39:28.159
What is that
supposed to mean?

39:28.190 --> 39:30.454
Maybe you're afraid of
finding out the whole truth.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.592
She already has the truth.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.598
Where is it?
In the book?

39:33.630 --> 39:34.858
Where in the book?

39:34.900 --> 39:36.060
Look at the pages.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.962
Don't look at the book,
look at the pages.

39:41.010 --> 39:42.875
That's the same thing.

39:42.910 --> 39:45.378
No, it's not.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.903
WOMAN ON TELEVISION:
How thin can a sandwich get?

40:13.940 --> 40:17.171
MAN ON TELEVISION:
Here, take half of mine.
Take it all, I can't eat.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.906
That's because
you've been packing away
steaks behind my back.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.111
Oh, stop it, will ya? I got
more on my mind than food.

40:22.150 --> 40:24.710
It wouldn't be that gal
that beat me out of
my breakfast, would It?

40:24.750 --> 40:26.149
You're pretty sharp,
aren't ya?

40:26.190 --> 40:27.680
Well, it's not what
you think.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.517
It's exactly
what I think.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.118
SPENCER: We were
supposed to find it.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.479
But why give the book back

40:32.530 --> 40:33.929
after going to all
that trouble to steal it?

40:33.960 --> 40:36.190
_ Because now
It's a TrOJan horse.

40:36.230 --> 40:37.857
Look.

40:37.900 --> 40:41.563
There are changes, little
changes that have to add up.

40:41.600 --> 40:45.138
Like here it says,
"I can't stop thinking
of Ambrose Pierson."

40:45.170 --> 40:46.933
But in the picture
I took in the car,

40:46.970 --> 40:50.201
it says, "I can't
stop thinking of
Ambrose Pavilion."

40:50.240 --> 40:52.071
What's Ambrose Pavilion?

40:52.110 --> 40:53.771
I don't know, but it was
a big enough clue

40:53.810 --> 40:54.913
that whoever
stole this book

40:54.950 --> 40:56.770
wanted to make sure
we never saw It,

40:56.820 --> 40:57.946
in fact that we saw
something else.

40:57.980 --> 40:59.641
Are all the changes
like that?

40:59.690 --> 41:00.816
Yeah, so far.

41:00.850 --> 41:03.011
January becomes March,
a cute girl becomes a cute guy.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.618
And "A" things
we won't notice

41:04.660 --> 41:06.184
because we'll th_ink_we're
so smart for getting It back.

41:06.230 --> 41:06.958
But "A" doesn't know
that I have

41:06.990 --> 41:08.890
the original pages
on my phone.

41:08.930 --> 41:10.557
So we have our edge back.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.626
You're saying that Ezra
left that book for us to find.

41:13.670 --> 41:14.989
Which means
he knows we know.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.268
We have to tell Aria.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.530
She's still not answering.

41:18.570 --> 41:19.559
Then we'll sit on her porch

41:19.610 --> 41:21.703
until she gets back
from Albany.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.230
Syracuse.

41:25.910 --> 41:27.047
Wait.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.570
Let me try calling her
one more time

41:28.620 --> 41:30.247
before we wake up
the whole house.

41:36.220 --> 41:37.710
Guys.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.940
( bawdy music playing )
