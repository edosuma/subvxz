         Good evening, everyone!

            Hello.              

02:08.377 --> 02:09.811
            You know, it's

          but there's not a room
          you step foot into

    where you're not the most   
    beautiful woman there.      

02:14.116 --> 02:16.484
That's deplorable sentence      
structure, Frasier.             

02:16.519 --> 02:17.818
                  What you mean 
                  to say is that

02:17.853 --> 02:20.588
      I am the most beautiful   
      woman in any room I enter.

02:20.622 --> 02:21.922
Yes. Well, thank you

        Hello, Rebecca.         

02:46.565 --> 02:48.433
                  I have a small
                  favor to ask  

02:48.467 --> 02:50.835
              regarding our     
              impending wedding.

02:50.869 --> 02:53.204
      Since all my close friends
      will be out of town,      

02:53.239 --> 02:55.307
          and we have had a     
          previous conversation,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.809
        and our eyes have met on
        a number of occasions,  

02:57.843 --> 03:01.646
            I was wondering if  
            you'd consent to    
            be my maid of honor.

03:02.814 --> 03:04.249
        Me?                     

03:04.283 --> 03:06.284
Isn't that usually              
your best friend?               

03:06.318 --> 03:07.585
                    You are my  
                    best friend.

03:08.937 --> 03:10.205
Oh, I'm very flattered.         

03:10.239 --> 03:12.406
Um... I guess so.               

03:12.441 --> 03:13.574
Sure, Lila.                     

03:13.609 --> 03:14.626
                         Lilith.

03:14.744 --> 03:16.510
Right. Right.                   

03:16.545 --> 03:17.895
I knew that.                    

03:17.929 --> 03:19.130
                  Let's discuss 
                  wedding gowns.

03:19.165 --> 03:20.365
        Do you think black...   

03:20.399 --> 03:21.749
Sam, it, uh,                    
goes without saying             

03:21.784 --> 03:24.119
of course, that you'll be       
my best man.                    

03:24.153 --> 03:25.703
 Aw, I-I don't want to do that. 

03:25.738 --> 03:27.672
    It makes me feel            
    so uncomfortable.           

03:27.706 --> 03:30.775
     I mean, a best man has     
  to give a toast, doesn't he?  

03:30.809 --> 03:32.510
 No, look, I-I took the liberty 

03:32.545 --> 03:34.546
 of writing down a few things.  

03:34.580 --> 03:36.030
            Then I'd be honored.

03:36.065 --> 03:37.665
            Oh, that's great.   

03:37.699 --> 03:38.783

03:38.817 --> 03:39.951
     for a bachelor party?      

03:39.985 --> 03:42.086
    Oh, actually,               
    I haven't any plans.        

03:42.121 --> 03:44.072
      Well, would you like      
      to have one tonight?      

03:44.106 --> 03:45.556
            Well, what do you   
            think, darling?     

03:45.590 --> 03:47.292
            Uh, would I like    
            a bachelor party?   

03:48.493 --> 03:51.029
Well... while I feel            
that particular ritual          

03:51.063 --> 03:54.265
is as passé as taking           
the topknot of one's dead enemy,

03:54.300 --> 03:56.701
I will not deprive you          
of the experience.              

03:56.735 --> 03:58.436
Immature though it might be.    

03:58.470 --> 04:00.004
                  She's a gamer!

04:00.039 --> 04:00.755

04:06.762 --> 04:09.164
You know, uh,                   
being maid of honor             

04:09.198 --> 04:11.766
means you have                  
to throw Brunehilda             

04:11.801 --> 04:13.168

04:13.202 --> 04:14.235
                      Oh, right.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.504
                I guess I should
                do something.   

04:16.538 --> 04:17.355
             What kind of shower
             do you think?      

04:17.473 --> 04:18.673
                 Kitchen? Linen?

04:18.707 --> 04:20.241
Look at who she's               
hitching up with.               

04:20.274 --> 04:22.844
Better make it marital aids.    

04:23.312 --> 04:25.446
    I'll handle this.           

04:25.480 --> 04:26.514
          Uh, Lilith?           

04:26.548 --> 04:28.249
         What do you say we have
         a little get-together  

04:28.284 --> 04:29.483
            at my place tonight?

04:29.518 --> 04:30.752
     That would be lovely.      

04:30.786 --> 04:32.403
     Now, you're gonna have     
to tell me who to invite,       

04:32.437 --> 04:33.504
    because I don't know...     

04:33.538 --> 04:36.107
      anything about you.       

04:36.141 --> 04:38.092
I only wish there were some way 

04:38.127 --> 04:39.927
  I could repay you, Rebecca.   

04:39.962 --> 04:41.129
     Oh, don't mention it.

    to admit a family member

    to a mental institution,    

04:44.516 --> 04:46.884

    speed up the paperwork.

04:59.115 --> 05:01.682
             loosen the old     
             noose, so to speak.

05:01.717 --> 05:04.118
            Really have some fun
            while I still can.

of cold feet?                   

05:07.689 --> 05:08.556
No! No! Not at all.             

05:08.590 --> 05:10.642

with this woman

and she has my dear old mother  
tied up in the cellar,          

05:13.011 --> 05:14.512
I'm gonna go through with it.

05:16.765 --> 05:17.832
        Darling...              

05:17.867 --> 05:20.084
could I speak with you a moment?

05:20.119 --> 05:21.953
Excuse me.                      

05:21.987 --> 05:23.587
The ball and chain.             

05:27.243 --> 05:28.709
Frasier, do you realize that is 

05:28.743 --> 05:31.078
the fourth derogatory remark    
about marriage                  

05:31.112 --> 05:32.480
you've made this evening?       

05:32.514 --> 05:33.664
          Oh, come on, my angel.

05:33.698 --> 05:35.600
              I mean, they're...
              they're jokes.    

05:35.634 --> 05:37.301
         I mean, everybody knows
         my mother is dead.     

05:37.336 --> 05:39.803
                 That's what    
                 makes it funny.

05:40.806 --> 05:43.140
No one loves a good joke        
more than I.                    

05:43.175 --> 05:45.510
But I find that--               
as our wedding day approaches-- 

05:45.544 --> 05:48.396
the frequency of these quips    
has increased.                  

05:48.431 --> 05:50.298
Are you having second thoughts? 

05:50.332 --> 05:51.966
            Well, only that I   
            love you more now   

05:52.001 --> 05:53.567
            than I did          
            five minutes ago.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.163
        Oh, nonsense, Karen, you
        didn't spoil anything.  

12:13.197 --> 12:14.665
                  And under the 
                  circumstances,

12:14.699 --> 12:17.034
                 ( <i>chuckling</i> ): 
                 we understand, 
                 don't we, guys?

12:20.655 --> 12:22.272
                 There, you see?

12:22.307 --> 12:24.441
             Well, bye-bye, now.

12:24.476 --> 12:25.943
    Bye-bye.                    

12:29.047 --> 12:31.015
 Maybe I shouldn't get married. 

12:31.049 --> 12:33.250
          Oh, come on,          
  what are you talking about?   

12:33.284 --> 12:34.952
Oh, it's time I realized        

12:34.987 --> 12:37.254
that there are                  
two Frasier Cranes.             

12:37.289 --> 12:40.123
 Frasier the prospective groom  
who sent Karen on her way,      

12:40.158 --> 12:43.260
 and Frasier the pig who wanted 
 to see her shake her nonnies.  

12:45.079 --> 12:46.530
 You know, I've never revealed  
        this to anybody,        

12:46.565 --> 12:47.665
     but when Diane left me     

12:47.699 --> 12:49.450
at the altar, I...              
well, there was                 

12:49.484 --> 12:51.018
 a tiny voice that kept saying, 

12:51.053 --> 12:53.337
     "You're off the hook,      
     you're off the hook."      

12:53.372 --> 12:54.254
                      NORM:     
                      Yeah, the 
                      only voice

12:54.289 --> 12:55.806
    I heard was Vera's          

12:55.841 --> 12:58.142
just yapping and yapping.       

12:58.176 --> 12:59.326
                 MAN:           
                 You ever notice

12:59.360 --> 13:01.779
        it's always the women   
        who want to get married?

13:01.813 --> 13:04.548
            Yapping and yapping.

13:04.582 --> 13:07.017
  Well, you know, when I think  
of all the unhappy people       

13:07.052 --> 13:09.353
      whom I've counseled       
  over the years, whose lives   

13:09.388 --> 13:14.108
have been scarred and destroyed 
by marriages badly cast,        

13:14.142 --> 13:16.143
I could write a book.           

13:16.177 --> 13:19.330
     I have written a book.     

13:19.364 --> 13:20.247
      Come on, now, Fras.       

13:20.365 --> 13:22.199
    You're just having          
      last-minute jitters.      

13:22.234 --> 13:23.968
     Geez, I-I don't know.      

13:24.002 --> 13:27.120
Maybe Lilith                    
isn't the woman for me.         

13:27.155 --> 13:29.423
What do you think of her, guys? 

13:29.458 --> 13:31.758
                Tell me, listen,
                I-I-I demand... 

13:31.793 --> 13:33.693
    complete honesty.           

13:33.728 --> 13:36.347
         Well, uh, Doc,         
    I'll be honest with you.    

13:36.381 --> 13:38.983
( <i>clearing throat</i> ):            
Uh, ixnay, ixnay.               

13:39.017 --> 13:40.267
Oh, no, Normie, no,             

13:40.385 --> 13:42.953
I just wish                     
that I was there for you.       

13:47.692 --> 13:49.693
        No, uh...               

13:49.727 --> 13:51.028
        I was, uh,              

13:51.062 --> 13:53.097
waiting for you                 
to wise up, there, Doc.         

13:53.131 --> 13:55.032
You know, I mean,               
Lilith Sternin--                

13:55.067 --> 13:56.267
I mean, even the name           

13:56.301 --> 13:58.669
makes the old butt cheeks,      
uh, tighten up,                 

13:58.703 --> 14:00.204
you know what I mean?           

14:00.238 --> 14:03.290
    I mean, she is Olive Oyl    
without the good fashion sense. 

14:03.325 --> 14:05.726
         ( <i>chuckling</i> )          
 And that personality, geez...  

14:05.760 --> 14:07.595
Hey, whoa, whoa, come on,       
hey, Cliff, that's enough.      

14:07.629 --> 14:09.863
    Yeah, you think so?         
Yeah, yeah.                     

14:09.897 --> 14:11.132
All right.                      

14:11.166 --> 14:13.467
      Sam, you know, you've been
      uncharacteristically mute.

14:13.502 --> 14:15.469
         I mean, surely you have
         some opinion on this.  

14:15.504 --> 14:16.737
No, no, do it, man.             

14:16.771 --> 14:17.904
I think you should              

14:17.939 --> 14:19.924
walk off together               
into the sunset, you know?      

14:19.958 --> 14:21.258
Live happily ever after.        

14:21.292 --> 14:22.343
  Translation: Frasier Crane,   

14:22.377 --> 14:24.211
you're a complete fool          
if you get married.             

14:24.245 --> 14:25.579
      I did not say that.       

14:25.614 --> 14:27.681
    Now, listen, Sam, I know    
 exactly what you're thinking.  

14:27.715 --> 14:29.450
          I mean, every fiber of
          your body speaks it.  

14:29.484 --> 14:30.484
          You live it every day.

14:30.519 --> 14:32.436
         Give me one good reason
         why the single life    

14:32.471 --> 14:33.870
                  is better than
                  being married.

14:33.905 --> 14:37.408
Okay, uh...                     
well, let's see.                

14:37.410 --> 14:39.843
When I get home, I don't        
have to explain to anybody      

14:39.877 --> 14:42.112
uh, where I've been             
or what I've been doing.        

14:42.147 --> 14:43.814
If I was out                    
having a good time,             

14:43.848 --> 14:47.000
I don't have to call home       
to see if I can stay later.     

14:47.034 --> 14:48.485
Oh, that reminds me.            

14:48.519 --> 14:49.886
SAM:                            
There, right there.             

14:49.921 --> 14:51.221
There you go.                   

14:51.256 --> 14:52.990
See, that's                     
what you're losing, man--       

14:53.024 --> 14:54.491
your freedom.                   

14:54.525 --> 14:57.828
You know, I can eat doughnuts   
for dinner if I want to.        

14:57.863 --> 15:00.530
Nobody nags me                  
to put down the toilet seat.    

15:00.565 --> 15:02.967
I am the king                   
of my own remote control.       

15:03.001 --> 15:04.268
I can date                      
anybody I want to,              

15:04.302 --> 15:06.003
and if somebody better          
turns up--                      

15:06.037 --> 15:08.405
and somebody always does,       
bless their hearts--            

15:08.440 --> 15:10.307
then I can date them            
the very next night.            

15:10.342 --> 15:11.508
You know,                       
I don't have to worry           

15:11.542 --> 15:12.876
about forgetting                
an anniversary,                 

15:12.910 --> 15:16.113
no mother-in-laws,              
no father-in-laws,              

15:16.147 --> 15:18.248
no laws, period.                

15:18.283 --> 15:20.984
                 I only asked   
                 for one reason.

15:21.019 --> 15:23.253
                My God.         

15:23.288 --> 15:25.172
    I'm, I'm actually           
    beginning to have doubts.   

15:25.206 --> 15:26.273
            No.                 

15:26.307 --> 15:27.608
                  You know, I've
                  got to hear   

15:27.642 --> 15:28.809
                    the voice of
                    my beloved  

15:28.844 --> 15:29.877
            just to reassure me.

15:29.911 --> 15:32.162
          Uh, Woody, Woody, give
          me Rebecca's number,  

15:32.197 --> 15:34.164
     and hand me the phone,     
        would you?              

15:34.199 --> 15:36.334
         Oh, Dr. Crane,         
     if Miss Howe answers,      

15:36.368 --> 15:38.569
  could you ask her something   
            for me?             

15:38.603 --> 15:39.386
    What's that, Wood?          

15:39.421 --> 15:42.305
Ask her if she has Prince Albert
        in a can.               

15:42.340 --> 15:43.640
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

15:43.675 --> 15:45.075
Don't tell her it was me.       

15:45.109 --> 15:46.259
              No.               

15:49.648 --> 15:50.914
                        FRASIER:
                        Hello.  

15:50.949 --> 15:51.915
         Yeah, h-hello.         

15:51.949 --> 15:53.734
      Is that you, Carla?       

15:53.768 --> 15:55.285
        ( <i>music playing</i> )       
    Yeah, yeah, who is it?      

15:55.319 --> 15:56.070
    Uh, it's Frasier.           

15:56.188 --> 15:57.288
     What's all that noise?     

15:57.322 --> 15:58.889
  What's going on over there?   

15:58.923 --> 16:01.575
     We're making a quilt.      

16:01.610 --> 16:03.710
  Well, can I speak to Lilith,  
            please?             

16:03.744 --> 16:04.728
     Well, is it important?     

16:04.762 --> 16:07.964
She's showing the male stripper 
    where to put his things.    

16:07.999 --> 16:09.266
             What?              

16:09.301 --> 16:11.552
    Oh, I-I got to get back.    

16:11.586 --> 16:15.255
         I-I got a bet          
this guy's packing socks.       

16:17.709 --> 16:20.477
 She'll call you back sometime. 

16:23.681 --> 16:25.216
What happened?                  

16:25.250 --> 16:27.218
          Oh, nothing.          

16:27.252 --> 16:29.353
Seems Lilith                    
is indisposed at the moment.    

16:29.387 --> 16:31.621
She's helping to undress        
a male stripper.                

16:31.656 --> 16:33.323
( <i>guys oohing and aahing</i> )      

16:33.357 --> 16:35.509
A male stripper?                

16:35.543 --> 16:38.144
    Well, where do they put     
          the tassels?          

16:41.849 --> 16:44.985
    The thought of my Lilith    
  having one last carnal fling  

16:45.020 --> 16:48.055
  with some fellow in a Speedo  
    is beyond belief!           

16:48.089 --> 16:49.106
     Now, Frasier, I mean,      

16:49.141 --> 16:50.674
      just 'cause some guy      
      strips in her honor       

16:50.708 --> 16:53.244
doesn't mean they're going      
to wind up in the sack together.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.312
        Oh, no, no, no,         
you don't know my Lilith.       

16:55.347 --> 16:56.630
I'll tell you,                  
once her libido's cut loose,    

16:56.665 --> 16:58.449
I mean, there's no tying        
her down, unless, of course,    

16:58.483 --> 17:00.000
that's what she's into          
for the evening.                

17:01.386 --> 17:03.220
She's, right now,               
she's with him.                 

17:03.254 --> 17:05.923
          Oh, no, hey, hey, come
          on, take it easy here.

17:05.957 --> 17:08.692
She's with that man--           
that sweating, chiseled,        

17:08.727 --> 17:10.694
                        Frasier.
pulsing, throbbing...           

17:10.729 --> 17:12.311
Hey, hey, whoa.                 
sexy...

Creme de Menthe?                

17:21.521 --> 17:24.407
You couldn't find               
some water?                     

17:27.261 --> 17:29.296
    My God, Sam.                

17:29.331 --> 17:34.067
    You realize what this...    
          this means?           

17:34.101 --> 17:36.287
Well, I-I don't know            
the clinical term for it,       

17:36.321 --> 17:37.821
but it seems to me              

17:37.855 --> 17:39.690
you were going                  
a little scooters there.        

17:41.859 --> 17:43.360
             I was jealous, Sam.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.029
            I-I was insanely,   
            blindly jealous.    

17:46.064 --> 17:50.033
      If ever I needed a clearer
      gut-level demonstration   

17:50.068 --> 17:52.903
            of my feelings,     
            I mean, that was it.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.771
    Yes, yes, it's perverted.   

17:54.806 --> 17:58.408
             Yes, it's childish,
             but yes, it's love.

17:58.442 --> 18:00.661
Maybe you ought                 
to go see her right now.        

18:00.695 --> 18:02.062
                I will, Sam.    

18:02.096 --> 18:04.615
             There's just one   
             matter that has to 
             be rectified first.

18:04.649 --> 18:08.652
        Cliff, in light         
     of my recent decision,     

18:08.687 --> 18:13.957
      I now take offense at your
      remarks about Lilith.     

18:13.991 --> 18:17.294
      In short, I'm going       
    to kick your sorry butt.    

18:19.097 --> 18:21.165
     Ah, now, come on, Doc,     
just cool down, will you?       

18:21.199 --> 18:22.632
      It was just a joke.       

18:22.667 --> 18:25.269
 Oh, you mean like that costume 
      you wear every day?       

18:25.303 --> 18:27.354
             GUYS:              
             Whoa!              

18:30.542 --> 18:32.776
 All right, put up your dukes,  
        Dr. Cream Puff.         

18:32.810 --> 18:34.328
                Okay, now we    
                got a party, eh?

18:34.362 --> 18:35.662
    ( <i>men laugh and agree</i> )     

18:35.696 --> 18:37.931
     All right, all right,      
     uh, before we start,       

18:37.965 --> 18:39.399
        let's just, uh,         

18:39.434 --> 18:41.084
    set a few ground rules,     
        all right?              

18:41.853 --> 18:43.020
  Uh, no punching in the face   

18:43.054 --> 18:45.171
     because that can cause     
      severe brain damage.      

18:46.440 --> 18:48.425
Oh, oh, all right, uh,          
just one other thing.           

18:48.459 --> 18:50.093
Uh, no hitting                  
below the belt.                 

18:50.128 --> 18:51.812
    I'm about to be married.    

18:51.846 --> 18:53.914
Uh, all right, all right,       
fair enough, fair enough.       

18:58.135 --> 18:59.119
All right,                      
well, no hitting                

18:59.154 --> 19:00.637
in the, uh,                     
right shoulder, though.         

19:00.672 --> 19:02.105
That's my bag shoulder,         
all right?                      

19:09.280 --> 19:12.949
             What about the, um,
             upper thigh area?  

19:12.984 --> 19:14.518
        Uh...                   

19:14.552 --> 19:17.270
Oh, no, I think we covered that 
on page five over here.         

19:17.305 --> 19:18.872
        Yeah.                   

19:18.907 --> 19:20.641
             Well, then, where  
             does that leave us?

19:20.675 --> 19:21.975
I don't know;                   
it's leaving me                 

19:22.010 --> 19:23.877
with writer's cramp,            
I'll tell you.                  

19:23.911 --> 19:25.612
            Well, let that be   
            a lesson to you.    

19:29.167 --> 19:31.134
                As for me,      

19:31.169 --> 19:32.603
I'm going to go back            
to my beloved,                  

19:32.637 --> 19:34.638
      throw my arms around      
her milky-white shoulders,      

19:34.673 --> 19:36.273
      and let me tell you       
      something, fellas.        

19:36.307 --> 19:38.042
     I'm going to tell her      
      I'm devoted to her,       

19:38.076 --> 19:40.343
    and that I'm dedicating     
  the rest of my life to her.   

19:41.713 --> 19:43.179
Hello, everyone.                

19:43.965 --> 19:45.416
Frasier, is that you?           

19:45.450 --> 19:48.985
Good. I hope this doesn't spoil 
the bachelor party,             

19:49.020 --> 19:50.854
but the engagement is off.      

19:50.888 --> 19:52.373

19:52.407 --> 19:54.174
 <i>kaput.</i> Good night.             

19:54.209 --> 19:54.842
            What?!              

19:54.876 --> 19:56.110
        She's kind of juiced.   

19:56.144 --> 19:58.178
I can't be engaged              
to you, Frasier,                

19:58.213 --> 20:00.180
because I'm marrying            
Randy here.                     

20:01.533 --> 20:03.633
If anyone wants to get us       
a wedding gift,                 

20:03.668 --> 20:06.203
his butt is this size.          

20:10.508 --> 20:12.576
    Why don't you sit down,     
          Dr. Sternin?          

20:12.611 --> 20:15.412
Oh, "Dr. Sternin"               
is a little formal, isn't it?   

20:15.446 --> 20:21.318
    You can call me Sheena,     
  Ruler of the Jungle of Love.  

20:21.352 --> 20:22.635
Can somebody sober her up?      

20:22.670 --> 20:23.887
    Hey, I think                
    you lost a button.          

20:23.921 --> 20:26.089
              ( <i>Woody laughing</i> )

20:29.978 --> 20:32.396
We'll handle it from here.      
         Thanks, Randy.         

20:32.430 --> 20:34.714
 Happy to do it. There's still  
    the matter of cab fare.     

20:34.749 --> 20:37.033
         Oh. Here, there you go.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.569
Great. Thanks.                  

20:38.603 --> 20:40.137
            See you.            

20:42.106 --> 20:43.473
Oh, Randy, don't leave me.      

20:44.792 --> 20:48.528
    I'll never be able          
to hear "Shock the Monkey" again

20:48.562 --> 20:50.396
        without crying.         

20:55.070 --> 20:56.403
    Lilith,                     

20:56.437 --> 20:57.971
  what were you thinking of?!   

20:58.005 --> 21:00.173
      I'm sorry, Frasier,       
 it's just that I felt the need 

21:00.207 --> 21:01.608
      to get back at you.       

21:01.642 --> 21:03.360
            I waited all evening
            for you to call     

21:03.394 --> 21:04.994
        and say that the wedding
        was still on,           

21:05.029 --> 21:06.129
        but you didn't, you cur.

21:06.163 --> 21:07.313
    I did call!                 

21:07.348 --> 21:08.949
Didn't Carla tell you?          

21:08.983 --> 21:12.519
        She was too busy licking
        Bosco off Randy's chest.

21:14.555 --> 21:17.174
      I became increasingly more
      distraught and foolish    

21:17.208 --> 21:18.475
         as the night grew long.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.278
    Of course, the 11 tequila   
    shooters didn't help.       

21:21.312 --> 21:24.330
        And now, the epilogue   
        is that my behavior     

21:24.365 --> 21:27.951
    has probably cost me        
    the one man I truly love.   

21:27.986 --> 21:30.354
            Oh, you can probably
            still catch him.    

21:32.473 --> 21:33.807
Woody, I don't think            

21:33.841 --> 21:36.710
you're following along          
closely enough.                 

21:36.744 --> 21:38.195
Listen, you're not              
the only one                    

21:38.229 --> 21:41.565
who's behaved                   
irrationally tonight.           

21:41.599 --> 21:45.235
Lilith... I want                
to marry you anyway.            

21:46.854 --> 21:47.988
                You do?         

21:48.022 --> 21:49.339
    Absolutely.                 

21:49.373 --> 21:51.524
        For the rest of my life,

21:51.559 --> 21:54.661
            I will always       
            cherish those words:

21:54.695 --> 21:58.165
              "Lilith, I want to
              marry you anyway."

Come, my sweet.

         Oh, Lilith, just, uh...

22:10.261 --> 22:11.895
          promise me two things.

22:11.929 --> 22:14.664
