[shouts]

18:16.329 --> 18:19.964
- [in slow motion] No!

18:19.966 --> 18:22.033
- What?
You said she likes red sauce.

18:22.035 --> 18:25.470
- Low blow, man.
This is dry-clean only.

18:25.472 --> 18:33.211
<i>♪</i>

18:35.981 --> 18:39.417
- In case anyone's interested,
I'm out of the snake formation.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.420
- Well, I actually left it
earlier than you.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.421
I just didn't tell you.

18:43.423 --> 18:46.224
- The snake formation
is officially dead.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.526
- Fine by me.
- Me too!

18:48.528 --> 18:51.295
[whistle blows]

18:51.297 --> 18:52.330
- That's for the meatball.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.365
Ow!
- That's for the mustard.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.501
Oof!
- That's for blinding me.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.469
- Ah!
- Take that!

18:58.471 --> 19:00.771

punches smacking]

19:00.773 --> 19:03.174
[whistle blows]

19:04.343 --> 19:05.343
- Now, how did this happen?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.778
I thought you boys
had a snake formation.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.380
- Those days are over.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.615
- Well, that's a shame.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.150
I always thought
it was so nice,

19:12.152 --> 19:15.686
the way you all looked out
for each other.

19:15.688 --> 19:16.521
- She's right.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.322
What are we doing?
Are we really gonna

19:18.324 --> 19:20.525
throw away our friendship
over a girl?

19:20.527 --> 19:21.592
- Well, that ain't what I want.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.629
- Me neither.
You guys are my support circle.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.765
- I honestly don't think I can
make new friends at this point.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.334
- I can't believe we ever
let things get this far.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.804
- And the crazy thing is,
none of this is even our fault.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.241
It's Stella's for pitting us
against each other.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.376
- Yeah.
- You're right!

19:38.378 --> 19:41.045
- I say we go give her
the what for right now.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.580
Snake formation, fellers?

19:42.582 --> 19:45.750
[all hissing]

19:45.752 --> 19:47.718
- Stella, we need
to talk to you.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.587
- Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.588
- Oh, I think you know.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.491
We're through
with your mind games.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.592
Uh, thanks, Lincoln.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.128
- My what?
- Don't act all innocent.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.829
You nearly broke up
our friendship.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.632
- Asking us all out on dates
then making us compete

20:01.634 --> 20:03.668
to see who would
"blow you out of the water"?

20:03.670 --> 20:07.205
- Blow me out of the water?
What are you talking about?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.506
- Doesn't matter.
We're done.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.808
You couldn't choose
one of us for a boyfriend,

20:10.810 --> 20:14.278
so now you don't get any of us.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.846
- [laughs] What?

20:15.848 --> 20:18.416
I'm sorry for laughing.
It's just...

20:18.418 --> 20:20.184
you guys are so off base.

20:20.186 --> 20:24.188
I don't want a boyfriend.
I just wanted to be friends...

20:24.190 --> 20:24.855
with all of you.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.724
- Well, why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.793
- Uh, you may recall that
every time I walked up

20:28.795 --> 20:31.629
to you guys as a group,
you acted like total weirdos.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.699
That's why I was trying to get
to know you one-on-one--

20:34.701 --> 20:37.668
or what you call "dates."
all: Ah.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.770
- You know, maybe
this was a bad idea.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.606
It seems like you guys
just can't handle

20:41.608 --> 20:42.640
being friends with a girl.

20:42.642 --> 20:46.410
I'm gonna go hang out with
my lab partner, Mrs. Johnson.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.479
- Oh, man, we really messed up.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.348
- It's too bad,
'cause Stella's really fun.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.150
I was hoping she'd teach me
how to master the claw machine.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.653
- Yeah, and I was hoping
she'd help me pick out

20:55.655 --> 20:56.821
a wig for my mee-maw.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.289
- And she would've made
a great addition

20:58.291 --> 21:00.658
to our snake formation.
She could've been the rattle.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.494
- Well, maybe if we go
tell her how sorry we are,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.896
she'll give us another chance.

21:05.898 --> 21:10.268
Hey, Stella, we just wanna
apologize for how we acted.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.702
- Yeah.
You were right.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.638
Just 'cause you're a gal
and we're fellers

21:13.640 --> 21:16.173
don't mean you had to be
fixing for a romance.

21:16.175 --> 21:19.377
- What we don't know about
women could fill a library.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.678
- We just hope
you can forgive us,

21:20.680 --> 21:23.814
because we all really liked
hanging out with you--

21:23.816 --> 21:26.350
as a friend.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.786
Um, okay, well, that's cool.

21:28.788 --> 21:33.491
I guess we'll just,
uh, see you around.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.191
- Hang on.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.926
Lincoln, what's in
that thermos?

21:35.928 --> 21:38.396
- My dad's homemade
tomato soup.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.698
- I'll trade you
my fruit salad for it.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.599
- Deal!

21:41.601 --> 21:44.201
- Hey, how about swapping
them there rice cakes

21:44.203 --> 21:46.337
for some hush puppies?
- Definitely.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.905
- Any chance you'd trade
your juice box

21:47.907 --> 21:49.907
for a tuna kit?
- Sorry, dude.

21:49.909 --> 21:53.878
That's where I draw the line.
[laughter]

21:53.880 --> 21:56.814
- After lunch, we can work out
our new snake formation.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.282
- Just wanna throw
it out there:

21:58.284 --> 22:01.919
have you guys ever considered
a scorpion formation?

22:01.921 --> 22:04.555
It's 22% more effective.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.725
boys: Ooh!
