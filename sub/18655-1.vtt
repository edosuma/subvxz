[Music]

02:52.105 --> 02:54.275
[Background Music] During the
last 6 years, I've spent a lot

02:54.275 --> 02:57.845
of time wandering as part
of the California Coast.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.080
It's tough knowing it's all
going to be under the ocean

03:00.080 --> 03:02.816
after the killer quakes of 2063.

03:02.816 --> 03:06.220
My name is Jack Deth, I'm a cop

03:06.220 --> 03:07.888
from the future,
Trancer [inaudible].

03:07.888 --> 03:10.791
And I didn't know it yet
but back up the line,

03:10.791 --> 03:15.062
my old supervisor McNulty
was on his way to see me.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.231
McNulty is a professional
pain in the ass

03:17.231 --> 03:20.133
but the council was stuck
with him because like me,

03:20.133 --> 03:22.870
he had an ancestor
in old California.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.373
That's the only way to send
someone consciousness back

03:25.373 --> 03:27.875
in time over the genetic bridge.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.344
I hadn't learned about
the TCL chamber yet.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.479
[Noise]

03:31.479 --> 03:37.217
So this is the gizmo
that can carry a person

03:37.217 --> 03:38.652
through time, huh?

03:38.652 --> 03:41.789
Forward, but not
backwards Captain McNulty.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.824
It's still necessary
to send a consciousness

03:43.824 --> 03:46.394
down the genetic line first.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.528
That's why you're here.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.596
Ah, wait a minute.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.030
You need the chamber
in old California.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.633
We want you to go down the
line with the tap back device.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.468
Commander Raines,
I'm up for retirement.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.305
You will only
be gone 48 hours.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.906
Me again?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.442
Back down the line in 1985,
you don't know what it was

04:01.442 --> 04:04.578
like the last time waking up in
the body of a 9-year-old girl.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.681
Look, we're sending
you back to 1991.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.483
Your ancestor will be 15 now.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.884
And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

04:10.884 --> 04:13.454
Guys are going to try
and get in my pants.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.589
Raines, you got to
get somebody else.

04:15.589 --> 04:20.928
We already tried McNulty
special agent Alice Stillwell.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.229
Allice Stillwell.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.897
Jack Deth's wife?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.299
How can you send her back?

04:25.299 --> 04:28.736
She was killed in the Trancer
fight six and a half years ago?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.238
We sent a technician back
to the day before her death

04:31.238 --> 04:33.374
but something went wrong.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.877
She failed to tap back
for the TCL chamber.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.948
It's a Trancer job didn't it?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.115
I thought we'd be
finish with Trancers

04:42.115 --> 04:44.117
when we sent Whistler
6 years ago?

04:44.117 --> 04:47.388
So did we, but the
Trancer pool has been revived

04:47.388 --> 04:48.422
by the new Whistler.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.690
The new Whistler?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.558
His brother.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.560
When did he get a brother?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.828
Look, he's gone
back to old California.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.631
You're going there to find
agent Jack Deth and order him

04:57.631 --> 05:00.267
to return with Whistler
in the TCL chamber.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.471
Why not the regular
way using the serum?

[Noise]

05:06.974 --> 05:14.247
[Music & Noise]

05:14.247 --> 05:16.316
[Background Music]
He's been gone too long.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.620
His body here in the
present is calcified.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.455
His only way back
to this world is

05:21.455 --> 05:24.358
in his new body in
the TCL chamber.

05:24.358 --> 05:33.367
So he'll do that or he'll spend
the rest of life in the past.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.536
Look, the tap back
switch has been added

05:35.536 --> 05:36.970
to the long second watch,

05:36.970 --> 05:39.106
a technician will tell
you everything you need

05:39.106 --> 05:41.409
to know while the
serum takes effect.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.577
How do you feel
about this Raines?

05:43.577 --> 05:46.046
I means, it's been a great 6
years with Jack out of my hair,

05:46.046 --> 05:50.484
no offense Jack, but I didn't
know you were that big of a fan

05:50.484 --> 05:56.557
of Jack's after...
Well, you know, after...

05:56.557 --> 05:58.191
After what McNulty?

05:58.191 --> 06:01.862
I don't want to get into,
you know, who dropped who,

06:01.862 --> 06:04.865
but are you anxious
to get him back?

06:04.865 --> 06:08.936
Captain, we're
preparing for a Trancer war.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.304
Jack Deth has been offered
a seat on the council.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.306
A council seat?

06:13.306 --> 06:15.142
That's a lifetime appointment.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.511
Well those are the orders.

06:17.511 --> 06:23.116
Look, neither your personal
feelings nor mine matter.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.253
McNulty you got 48 hours
to complete this mission.

06:26.253 --> 06:29.022
The exact time we can keep
the chamber there before it

06:29.022 --> 06:31.024
boomerangs back.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.463
Two days, McNulty.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.066
[Background Music] Good luck.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.704
It's been 6 years
since the council sent me

06:43.704 --> 06:45.706
to protect Hap Ashby
from Whistler.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.542
The Council President was a
direct descendant of Hap's.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.944
Kill Hap and no more
Council President.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.346
When I found him, Hap
was a fallen idol,

06:53.346 --> 06:56.550
he'd been a Cy Young
award-winning big league pitcher

06:56.550 --> 06:59.953
and he became a drunk who's
living on the streets.

06:59.953 --> 07:03.023
After we send Whistler, Hap
got off the sauce and went

07:03.023 --> 07:05.192
into commodity speculation.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.927
He made a pile of money.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.197
He needs it to support his
hobby, collecting fire trucks.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.932
Hey, hey, hey.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.668
Jack and Lena Deth back in town.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.170
I thought you guys would
be gone another week?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.438
Me too.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.709
I had a funny feeling Hap.

07:21.709 --> 07:26.146
No, no not Trancers
again, come on Jack,

07:26.146 --> 07:28.148
it's been 6 years man.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.316
Take a look at the new folder.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.185
I've been having
a strange feeling.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.455
A feeling you get when
there are Trancers around.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.591
Somehow I knew they were back.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.027
Isn't she bitchin?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.361
That's nice Hap.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.596
Lena?

07:42.596 --> 07:47.467
I'm going to get him to bed.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.505

09:43.450 --> 09:44.284
Oh, computers are easy.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.552
I could show you how to do this.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.188
No, I don't think so.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.591
You know what today would
be absolutely perfect for?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.060
Yeah.

09:53.060 --> 09:58.365
That too but I was
thinking of something else.

09:58.365 --> 10:02.235
Lena, I could be persuaded
to do almost anything except

10:02.235 --> 10:03.536
to be dragged to the valley

10:03.536 --> 10:05.238
by some pencil-neck
real estate agent.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.474
Jack, you promised.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.142
No, I didn't, not today.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.410
We have the money.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.578
I want a home of our own.

10:11.578 --> 10:14.181
Honey, I have to
stay here close to Hap.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.083
He can afford
to hire bodyguards.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.951
You don't have to do everything.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.922
Jack, this is an incredible
house but I want our own place

10:21.922 --> 10:23.991
where we can raise a
family when we're ready.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.058
Wait a minute.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.794
I thought we were
talking about houses?

10:26.794 --> 10:29.963
I think we're talking
about a lot of things

10:29.963 --> 10:31.799
but I'm not going
to argue about this.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.967
I'm going to start looking for
houses today whether you come

10:33.967 --> 10:36.003
with me or not and if I
find something I like,

10:36.003 --> 10:37.705
I may just surprise you.

10:37.705 --> 10:41.041
Lena, the day you don't
surprise me is the day I'll

10:41.041 --> 10:42.542
be surprised.

Whistler's brother?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.043
Yeah, the council
sent another agent first,

12:56.043 --> 12:57.577

the tap back device.

What the hell are you
talking about McNulty?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.538
Yeah but there's
something different inside.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.840
Remember the long second watch?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.408
It saved our life
a couple of times.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.777
It still stops time
for 10 seconds?

13:30.777 --> 13:34.181
Yeah, and there's
the tap back switch.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.149
It sends a signal to the future.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.484
A couple of hours later,

13:37.484 --> 13:41.054
TCL chamber materializes
on that spot.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.155
Figure out where you want

13:42.155 --> 13:45.292
to put it before you
activate it because...

13:45.292 --> 13:47.227
Nice words, McNulty
you activate it

13:47.227 --> 13:49.762
when you took it off
the watch didn't you?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.632
Yeah, I guess I did.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.867
So that means the
stuff they're sending

13:53.867 --> 13:54.868
down the line is going to wind

13:54.868 --> 13:57.170

Yeah, right in the
middle of the god damn yard.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.710

to cover it up with.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.914
How 'bout a caterer's tent?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.581
We'll figure something out.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.051
Only a hook and ladder
to put it up but, you know.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.286
We'll only need
it for two days.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.687

14:14.687 --> 14:16.789
You said that there was another
Trancer they're going to send

14:16.789 --> 14:20.127
down the line, is
she anyone I know?

14:20.127 --> 14:24.497

14:44.784 --> 14:48.121
What if I did?

They're not going to let
you loonies wear no watch.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.126

smart enough to know I'm not one

14:53.126 --> 14:57.230
of these loonies, to use your
professional terminology.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.567

15:27.427 --> 15:32.799
it comes at that

15:32.799 --> 15:35.868
There's something
wrong with Alice Stilwell.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.638
Of course there is.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:27.483
Can you hear me Jack or
are you already dead?

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:36.559
[Gunshots]

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:47.837
Good, good, good,
good you're still alive,

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:54.510
going to be fun watching
you burn to death.

01:16:54.510 --> 01:17:03.519
[Music & Noise]

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:13.963
[Background Music] Save
a bullet for yourselves.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.766
There's got to be
another way out of here.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:19.068
No, they'll cut us
down the minute we run.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:23.472
Jack, what if
we're not running?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:28.712
[Music]

01:17:28.712 --> 01:17:29.412
Cover me!

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:30.379
What are we doing?

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.481
We're busting out of here.

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:41.557
[Music & Noise]

01:18:04.948 --> 01:18:14.023
[Music & Gunshots]

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:46.555
[Music & Siren]

01:19:06.943 --> 01:19:12.448
[Music]

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:15.952
[Noise & Gunshots]

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:25.028
[Music & Noise]

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.297
[Background Music] Jack,

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:06.135
the TCL is about to boomerang
back, we have to go now.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.703
How much time
is there McNulty?

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:09.906
Less than three
minutes so we got to hurry.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:14.110
Jack, please don't go.

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.214
Jack, come on.

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:25.488
Hurry up Jack I got
to take this serum

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:29.358
and get back before you
decide to explain everything.

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:31.060
No, can do McNulty.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.063
But you don't understand
Jack, your body is ossified.

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:37.133
Your only way back is in
the body you're in now.

01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:39.302
I'm not going back McNulty.

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:42.171
What? And give up
the seat on the council?

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:43.940
Do you know what that means?

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.375
It's like being king
of the universe.

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:49.745
You stay here, you're just a
Trancer hunter with no way home.

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:51.080
Lena is my home.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.884
Besides, there's only room
for one person in the chamber.

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:57.286
There's no good
to take Wardo back,

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:00.323
memory scans don't work
on dead people Jack.

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:03.092
I'm not talking
about Wardo, Alice.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:08.464
Hurry up Jack you got
less than two minutes.

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:13.069
You can't go back up
the line on the serum.

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:14.337
Something terrible
is going to happen

01:21:14.337 --> 01:21:15.905
to you the day after
you get back.

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:19.342
What are you talking
about Jack?

01:21:19.342 --> 01:21:22.045
They went back in your
past to send you down here.

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:26.182
You'll be killed the day
after you go back up the line.

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:31.320
How do you know?

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.090
You died in my arms, Alice.

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:38.627
But if you go back in this
body, you have a new reality.

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:43.866
Your life will begin
there, in the future.

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:51.074
But Jack, we won't
be together.

01:21:53.642 --> 01:22:02.118
At least you won't
die in my arms.

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:10.259
Get in Alice, come on, get in.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.928
The new Alice Stilwell
is going forward in time.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:19.035
But I still remember
everything.

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:20.103
You bet.

01:22:20.103 --> 01:22:26.509
That's all we have
anyway Alice, so long.

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:35.584
[Music]

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:08.051
[Music & Noise]

01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:32.508
You made it back again.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:41.584
[Music]

01:23:54.797 --> 01:23:56.031
Thank you Jack.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:24:01.204
Thank you for everything.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.407
Where is Jack?

01:24:04.407 --> 01:24:05.474
Why didn't he return?

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:07.610
Well, to tell you
the truth commander.

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.480
I think he's found a new home.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:20.556
[Music]

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:27.630
[Background Music]
It's a nice place,

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:30.233
glad they could afford it.

01:24:30.233 --> 01:24:33.702
What the... What did you say
Mr. Deth does for a living?

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:41.510
Him? Fortune teller, yes
sir, real life fortune teller.
