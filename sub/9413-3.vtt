00:09.638 --> 00:15.122
I never realized how hard it would
be to deal with something like this.

00:15.123 --> 00:21.023
I was in the middle of nowhere
and nobody knew I was there.

00:25.950 --> 00:27.654
Something was going on in the house.

00:27.655 --> 00:30.955
That I couldn't explain.

00:33.312 --> 00:36.088
I looked the thing in the eye.

00:36.089 --> 00:39.879
It was clearly not a human being.

00:39.880 --> 00:44.168
What was tearing the
inside of my house apart?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.509
Oh my God!

00:46.953 --> 00:48.824
It was hunting me.

00:48.825 --> 00:50.424
Run now!

00:50.425 --> 00:52.405
Start!

00:52.693 --> 00:54.808
If you don't run..

00:54.809 --> 00:57.869
It's gonna kill you.

01:16.479 --> 01:19.464
I loved it, all my heart
I loved that house.

01:19.465 --> 01:23.425
It was a wonderful place to live.

01:25.113 --> 01:28.593
The house was my sanctuary.

01:28.973 --> 01:33.411
It was the perfect little house
that everybody dreams about.

01:33.412 --> 01:39.312
My mom's new boyfriend, Matt, moved into
the house with his daughter, Marie.

01:43.189 --> 01:44.219
What are you doing?

01:44.220 --> 01:48.000
Matt was an intelligent, smart..

01:48.006 --> 01:50.766
Funny, happy guy.

01:52.476 --> 01:55.078
I was happy to have Marie there.

01:55.079 --> 01:59.070
It felt like I had a little
sister that I had never had.

01:59.071 --> 02:02.202
We basically had a lot of fun together.

02:02.203 --> 02:05.751
Marie and my daughter became
good friends quickly.

02:05.752 --> 02:11.652
Which really helped our relationship
because we thought we had a good start.

02:22.388 --> 02:25.577
The very first strange
thing that happened..

02:25.578 --> 02:29.853
I went to the kitchen and there
was a jar of peanut butter,

02:29.854 --> 02:33.252
laying on it's side on the counter.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.233
Jamie!

02:35.641 --> 02:38.834
I looked at it thinking that
the kids had made a mess.

02:38.835 --> 02:41.361
Or the cats had knocked it over.

02:41.362 --> 02:45.255
But the strange thing about the
jar was that the peanut butter,

02:45.256 --> 02:49.156
looked as if it had been melted.

02:52.841 --> 02:56.679
I kinda thought it was a joke. I thought..

02:56.680 --> 03:00.011
"Why are you asking me
about peanut butter?"

03:00.012 --> 03:03.912
I didn't think anything of this.

03:04.156 --> 03:06.405
Oh my God!

03:06.406 --> 03:11.326
But then we started finding
things stacked or..

03:11.374 --> 03:14.674
Arranged in certain ways.

03:15.707 --> 03:18.303
I thought that Marie was doing it..

03:18.304 --> 03:20.524
At first.

03:24.176 --> 03:27.084
At this point, we started
taking pictures of everything,

03:27.085 --> 03:30.933
because we wanted proof
of what was happening.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.547
Oh my God!

03:32.548 --> 03:37.297
I did suspect the kids of some
of the things that happened.

03:37.298 --> 03:43.198
I still wasn't convinced that it
was still something supernatural.

03:50.245 --> 03:53.725
One day, everything changed.

03:56.003 --> 03:59.063
I have so much math homework.
Can you help me?

03:59.064 --> 04:03.804
I put my coffee down to go let the dog in.

04:13.448 --> 04:15.081
Marie?

04:15.082 --> 04:16.487
I didn't do that.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.279
You're the only one in here.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.702
Jamie, it wasn't me.

04:20.702 --> 04:24.196
I knew that we hadn't had an earthquake.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.312
I didn't bump anything.

04:26.313 --> 04:29.484
I didn't know what to think.

04:29.485 --> 04:33.099
I was angry, I was frustrated..

04:33.100 --> 04:34.761
And annoyed.

04:34.762 --> 04:38.302
I decided to clean my room.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.020
Mom!

04:49.482 --> 04:51.342
Mom!

04:52.366 --> 04:56.372
I heard Jamie me call me, I immediately
came in to the house. What happened?

04:56.373 --> 05:02.273
I closed the drawers and I turned
around, and the drawers were open..

05:02.633 --> 05:06.773
I couldn't believe what I just saw.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.146
Ah!

05:11.147 --> 05:12.690
I was freaking out.

05:12.691 --> 05:14.820
I was scared out of my mind.

05:14.821 --> 05:16.826
I saw with my own eyes.

05:16.827 --> 05:19.587
I saw it happen.

05:19.851 --> 05:22.671
That shook me up.

05:23.127 --> 05:25.661
Jamie said to me, "mom".

05:25.662 --> 05:29.862
"We have a poltergeist in the house."

05:30.785 --> 05:35.243
We knew that day that something
was really really wrong.

05:35.244 --> 05:37.884
But, that was..

05:38.002 --> 05:43.413
Nothing compared with what
happened in the following months.

05:43.414 --> 05:45.754
Oh my God!

05:47.717 --> 05:50.668
Everything was twisted..

05:50.669 --> 05:54.569
And pulled out, or on the floor.

05:58.631 --> 06:00.904
And it didn't stop.

06:00.905 --> 06:03.504
Doors would bang..

06:03.505 --> 06:07.165
All night long, all day long.

06:07.304 --> 06:09.703
It would just be constantly..

06:09.704 --> 06:14.204
Over, and over, and over, and over again.

06:15.607 --> 06:19.927
At night, all the lights would go off.

06:20.888 --> 06:23.129
Everything, every light in
the house would go off.

06:23.130 --> 06:26.559
And you could flip the switch and
the lights won't come back on.

06:26.560 --> 06:31.840
There was something in our
house that was uninvited.

06:46.128 --> 06:51.108
Matt didn't believe anything
that was happening.

06:54.054 --> 06:57.073
He thought that it was..

06:57.074 --> 06:58.798
Me..

06:58.799 --> 06:59.986
Doing it.

06:59.987 --> 07:04.847
He thought that I was
doing it for attention.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.817
One evening, I saw..

07:22.818 --> 07:25.938
Long drawn out arrows.

07:26.123 --> 07:29.963
Pointing in all different places.

07:33.270 --> 07:36.640
They went up the wall, across the ceiling.

07:36.641 --> 07:41.578
They would point towards the central
heating vents up on the walls.

07:41.579 --> 07:47.399
We thought maybe it might be
trying to communicate with us.

07:50.912 --> 07:53.903
I told Matt the vents lead up to the attic.

07:53.904 --> 07:58.891
Maybe there's something up
there we need to look for.

07:58.892 --> 08:02.132
Matt was very skeptical.

08:03.435 --> 08:05.659
He wanted to rationalize it.

08:05.660 --> 08:06.916
I don't care what you think.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.721
I wouldn't give him time.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.885
I told him, "you have to believe me."

08:10.886 --> 08:13.832
I don't care what you feel, I
don't care what you think.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.533
Something's in our house.

08:15.534 --> 08:18.028
Something's playing with us.

08:18.029 --> 08:23.369
Okay. I'll go up and I'll
take a look, all right?

08:35.554 --> 08:40.840
It's dirty, and messy and full
of loose double insulation.

08:40.841 --> 08:43.359
I wanted to watch.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.801
Just in case, I don't know.

08:45.802 --> 08:50.242
But, just in case something bad happened.

08:55.524 --> 08:59.741
The tension and energy
inside the house was..

08:59.742 --> 09:01.699
So heavy.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.040
And active.

09:05.241 --> 09:11.141
He couldn't get all the way across
the ceiling because it was dark.

09:15.481 --> 09:18.204
I don't know where I'm
putting my feet I can't..

09:18.205 --> 09:19.947
I can't see anything up here.

09:19.948 --> 09:23.945
When he said that to me,
a warning flag came up.

09:23.946 --> 09:29.846
And I said, "okay, that's it we can't do
this anymore, you can get hurt up here."

09:41.005 --> 09:43.060
You happy now?

09:43.061 --> 09:46.651
He did not fully accept it that day.

09:46.652 --> 09:50.192
But I still had some idea..

09:50.199 --> 09:55.179
We could communicate with
it and maybe stop it.

10:01.648 --> 10:05.144
My mom had talked to somebody who,

10:05.145 --> 10:09.335
suggested that she offer it something.

10:09.336 --> 10:11.763
A peace offering.

10:11.764 --> 10:17.664
I made a small place on the mantle,
you might say even like an altar.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.350
I love cats.

10:19.351 --> 10:22.967
So I had found a little cat figurine.

10:22.968 --> 10:25.758
And I put it on the mantle.

10:25.759 --> 10:29.238
And I spoke to it and I said..

10:29.239 --> 10:32.479
"This gift is for you."

10:33.114 --> 10:36.180
"I would like to give this small
place on the mantle as your place."

10:36.181 --> 10:40.049
" To let you know that we want no harm."

10:40.050 --> 10:43.584
"We don't want you to be afraid of us."

10:43.585 --> 10:48.130
"And we don't want to be afraid of you."

10:48.131 --> 10:49.823
What's going on?

10:49.824 --> 10:52.128
Matt wasn't happy about it.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.540
Matt was very much against the figurine.

10:54.541 --> 10:57.296
He was very much against
communicating with it.

10:57.297 --> 11:01.064
He was very much against
giving it a gift any kind.

11:01.065 --> 11:03.945
And he called it..

11:04.266 --> 11:05.750
Talking to the devil.

11:05.751 --> 11:07.696
Honestly, I do not want this here.

11:07.697 --> 11:10.172
I was making an effort, to change things.

11:10.173 --> 11:12.759
I was doing something.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.204
But in doing that..

11:15.205 --> 11:18.565
I risked our relationship.

11:19.651 --> 11:23.131
Matt just got really angry.

11:24.323 --> 11:26.544
- Matt!
- Daddy, don't do that!

11:26.545 --> 11:29.845
- No!
- Don't you dare!

11:30.367 --> 11:33.547
That's enough of that.

11:41.036 --> 11:42.350
Mom..

11:42.351 --> 11:45.457
It was one of those times where you..

11:45.458 --> 11:48.255
Just can't believe what
you see before your eyes.

11:48.256 --> 11:52.816
I know it landed in the field. I saw it.

12:19.891 --> 12:24.751
I told him you better
not to smash that cat.

12:25.229 --> 12:28.561
It was just going to make
things 10 times worse.

12:28.562 --> 12:31.621
- I don't know what that is.
- He did not listen to me.

12:31.622 --> 12:33.796
Matt, no.

12:33.797 --> 12:35.837
Don't!

12:36.234 --> 12:38.034
No!

12:38.711 --> 12:41.685
I felt like I was doomed.

12:41.686 --> 12:46.193
The first thing I thought was, we're
going to go through hell for this.

12:46.194 --> 12:49.254
It's gonna retaliate.

13:06.308 --> 13:09.368
That night we found..

13:10.268 --> 13:13.508
The word "cat" written..

13:13.888 --> 13:16.828
All over the house.

13:22.347 --> 13:25.767
It had gone on a rampage.

13:31.072 --> 13:34.612
As we were cleaning it up..

13:35.329 --> 13:38.929
We noticed what looked like..

13:39.538 --> 13:41.818
Footprints.

13:44.777 --> 13:46.761
They did not look human.

13:46.762 --> 13:50.962
They just did not look human at all.

13:51.546 --> 13:55.295
I saw those footprints down there..

13:55.296 --> 13:58.359
And I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.780
They were huge round toes.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.803
And wide.

14:06.086 --> 14:09.506
Whatever it or they were..

14:09.537 --> 14:12.957
Was in the house with us.

14:14.946 --> 14:17.933
The first thing that came to my mind was..

14:17.934 --> 14:20.281
"What was in my house?"

14:20.282 --> 14:25.202
What was tearing the
inside of my house apart?

14:38.877 --> 14:43.284
Having all of this happening
at the house while I was..

14:43.285 --> 14:47.635
Trying to hold down a job
was just tremendous stress.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.629
I wanted to leave really bad.

14:49.630 --> 14:52.972
I wanted to get away from..
Everybody wanted to get away from it.

14:52.973 --> 14:57.075
But I was already struggling
to make house payments.

14:57.076 --> 15:00.016
It wasn't feasible.

15:04.503 --> 15:08.854
At the same time that it
was attacking the house.

15:08.855 --> 15:12.275
It started on the animals.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.507
We had two cats that each had a litter.

15:15.508 --> 15:18.655
And they were very sweet dispositioned.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.596
Very loving kittens.

15:23.842 --> 15:26.681
Soon, one by one..

15:26.682 --> 15:30.582
Each one got really, really sick.

15:36.099 --> 15:40.119
There was nothing I could do, to..

15:40.527 --> 15:42.447
Help.

15:42.721 --> 15:47.933
We thought perhaps maybe they just didn't
have enough energy to fight off this thing.

15:47.934 --> 15:52.014
We thought perhaps it used them up.

15:53.207 --> 15:55.269
They all died.

15:55.270 --> 16:01.170
Just right after.. One after another.
They didn't have a chance.

16:01.410 --> 16:03.246
I was scared.

16:03.247 --> 16:07.315
I was scared that it was
attacking my pets, to..

16:07.316 --> 16:09.326
Get at me.

16:09.327 --> 16:12.676
Maybe this isn't going to
stop with the animals.

16:12.677 --> 16:16.575
It might have the capability of..

16:16.576 --> 16:18.158
Taking life.

16:18.159 --> 16:22.019
Not just our animals, but possibly..

16:22.020 --> 16:24.360
One of us.

16:30.961 --> 16:32.494
I was at work.

16:32.495 --> 16:35.404
Jamie had gone out to run an errand.

16:35.405 --> 16:38.765
Marie was at home, alone.

16:39.683 --> 16:45.323
This thing turned the TV on
and off in rapid succession.

17:11.477 --> 17:13.396
Stop!

17:21.915 --> 17:23.265
Marie called.

17:23.266 --> 17:24.284
- Hello.
- Susan?

17:24.285 --> 17:27.559
She told me she the furniture.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.160
It's moving across the room.

17:35.622 --> 17:41.078
I came home and as soon as
I got one lock, unlocked.

17:41.079 --> 17:43.649
It would be locked it again.

17:43.650 --> 17:45.104
- Marie!
- Jamie!

17:45.105 --> 17:49.305
- Help me!
- I can't open the door!

17:50.719 --> 17:55.015
She grabbed her digital camera and
she took a succession of flashes,

17:55.016 --> 17:56.638
just to light up the room.

17:56.639 --> 18:01.199
Marie, you have to help me open the door!

18:05.004 --> 18:07.524
Oh thank God.

18:10.811 --> 18:15.952
These pictures appeared on her
camera that were just really..

18:15.953 --> 18:18.353
Unbelievable.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.281
Unbelivably..

18:38.836 --> 18:40.912
Bizarre.

18:40.913 --> 18:44.453
Photos of this light energy.

18:44.849 --> 18:47.897
Appeared on her camera.

18:47.898 --> 18:52.416
What was foremost in my mind was,
if it could move heavy furniture.

18:52.417 --> 18:54.047
What else could I do?

18:54.048 --> 18:57.108
How far would it go?

19:02.146 --> 19:06.346
The level of fear at that time was..

19:10.169 --> 19:15.269
Indescribable, really there's
no way to describe..

19:16.115 --> 19:18.035
How..

19:19.016 --> 19:21.776
It made me feel.

19:23.727 --> 19:28.643
That was the day that Matt
realized that this thing,

19:28.644 --> 19:33.442
in our house could attack his
daughter while she was alone.

19:33.443 --> 19:36.383
And he got worried.

19:40.566 --> 19:46.326
He got out the phone book and
he started calling churches.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.049
Hello.

19:49.050 --> 19:53.553
The first couple of churches that
he called didn't offer any help.

19:53.554 --> 19:55.347
- No, Sir.
- Okay, thanks.

19:55.348 --> 19:57.508
No, Sir.

19:59.572 --> 20:03.139
It's difficult to speak
to someone about it.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.059
That takes a lot guts.

20:05.060 --> 20:08.919
Because you put yourself
up for accusations..

20:08.920 --> 20:12.160
Disbelief and skepticism.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.324
He finally got a hold of a pastor,

20:15.325 --> 20:20.785
that was willing to come out
to our house immediately.

20:27.230 --> 20:29.913
There was a little bit of hope.

20:29.914 --> 20:33.359
That things would get better.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.960
By them coming to our house.

20:37.162 --> 20:42.449
We finally found someone that believed
us and that would come help us..

20:42.450 --> 20:47.070
Figure out what was going on in our house.

20:51.590 --> 20:54.590
The house was just..

20:55.030 --> 20:56.619
A total mess.

20:56.620 --> 21:01.964
It was embarrassing to even
have anybody in the house.

21:01.965 --> 21:07.865
He looked all around the house and
saw all the stuff on the walls.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.874
He said.. "This is bad."

21:10.875 --> 21:15.615
"There's a spiritual
warfare going on here."

21:17.530 --> 21:20.289
They just prayed with us and that was it.

21:20.290 --> 21:23.509
Is there anymore you can do?

21:23.510 --> 21:26.289
We can't help you.

21:26.290 --> 21:31.690
That was the last I ever
heard of them or saw them.

21:35.180 --> 21:38.720
We felt completely abandoned.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.900
And left out to dry.

21:41.911 --> 21:44.911
We were on our own.

21:56.710 --> 22:01.030
As time went on, my feeling was that..

22:01.280 --> 22:05.356
The only way to get rid of
this thing out of our lives.

22:05.357 --> 22:08.477
Was to just move out.

22:09.950 --> 22:13.459
I didn't have to money to move out.

22:13.460 --> 22:18.269
And I didn't have friends
that I could go stay with.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.910
I felt trapped.

22:21.430 --> 22:25.210
I felt my family breaking down.

22:25.710 --> 22:30.119
Matt and I were constantly
loosing our tempers.

22:30.120 --> 22:35.189
Because we couldn't communicate,
we couldn't talk about it.

22:35.190 --> 22:39.150
Our relationship was falling apart.

22:45.810 --> 22:51.510
I remember the stress that I
was in, that I was feeling.

22:52.590 --> 22:55.410
How alone I felt.

22:56.810 --> 23:00.770
It's hard to relive all of this.

23:02.970 --> 23:07.050
Jamie was afraid to leave the room.

23:07.080 --> 23:12.980
Her room seemed to be the one place
where she felt she had a barrier.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.930
She was wrong.

23:22.540 --> 23:26.980
This pounding started on my bedroom door.

23:30.400 --> 23:35.380
It was so loud, I was
actually frozen in fear.

23:40.890 --> 23:46.790
It just eventually got to the point
where I had to go look in the hallway.

23:53.930 --> 23:57.770
Right before I opened the door..

23:59.480 --> 24:02.060
It would stop.

24:03.240 --> 24:08.820
It's like it knew that I was
coming to open the door.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.932
And I would close the door..

24:12.933 --> 24:14.869
It would start again.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.867
It went on for approximately 3 hours.

24:17.868 --> 24:19.168
Stop!

24:19.169 --> 24:22.589
That pounding was horrific.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.719
Terrible.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.500
Eventually, the pounding stopped.

24:33.500 --> 24:38.900
When I opened the door, there
was just a giant hole.

24:39.720 --> 24:43.299
It looked like a battering
ram hit the door.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.720
And the doorknob was bent.

24:51.450 --> 24:57.330
Everything was utilized by this
thing to pound on that door.

25:02.650 --> 25:06.319
The light in the bathroom
started going on and off.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.520
I figured something must be in there.

25:11.980 --> 25:17.620
And whatever it was, it was
trying to get into my room.

25:20.090 --> 25:22.439
There was no way to lock the door.

25:22.440 --> 25:27.099
The bathroom door didn't
have the door knob on it.

25:27.100 --> 25:30.928
I decided to take this
kite string that we had..

25:30.929 --> 25:34.739
And wrapped it through
the hole in the door.

25:34.740 --> 25:38.489
I figured if I have the
other end of this string..

25:38.490 --> 25:42.450
This thing can not open the door.

25:44.350 --> 25:48.749
I started feeling it pulling on the string.

25:48.750 --> 25:54.650
As soon as she tightened up on
the rope, it tugged at the door.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.369
Stop it!

25:59.370 --> 26:02.419
I was freaking out because I figured that,

26:02.420 --> 26:08.320
once that door opened, I was gonna
see something from my nightmares.

26:09.270 --> 26:11.178
Some..

26:11.179 --> 26:13.029
Demon.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.690
And it was gonna come at me.

26:18.980 --> 26:24.295
I just held on to the string and figured
that if it couldn't break this string.

26:24.296 --> 26:28.136
That it couldn't open the door.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.020
It cut the rope.

26:34.040 --> 26:38.180
It figured it out, it cut the rope.

26:40.290 --> 26:44.130
She was scared out of her wits.

26:45.300 --> 26:48.409
I knew it was coming, I knew
it was coming into the room.

26:48.410 --> 26:53.870
I knew that there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.349
I knew it was coming, I knew
it was coming into the room.

27:09.350 --> 27:14.810
I knew that there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.820
And there was nothing there.

27:24.690 --> 27:29.070
I really had to get out of that house.

27:29.210 --> 27:33.019
It closed the door and locked it.

27:33.020 --> 27:36.500
I immediately smelled smoke.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.979
I looked down and there was a pan..

27:47.980 --> 27:51.809
That had a paper towel
burning inside of it.

27:51.810 --> 27:55.110
Made to be like a wick.

27:59.830 --> 28:02.410
It had moved..

28:02.413 --> 28:06.793
Beyond anything that it had done before.

28:14.939 --> 28:18.839
I stepped out in to the hallway.

28:40.500 --> 28:46.400
I found toilet paper and paper
towels strewn through out the house.

28:46.780 --> 28:51.019
Wrapped around everything
that could catch fire.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.499
It actually was setting up..

28:54.500 --> 28:58.569
Something to carry a flame
through out the house.

28:58.570 --> 29:03.229
It was going to burn us alive in the house.

29:03.230 --> 29:08.030
I just knew that I had to put out the fire.

29:21.479 --> 29:27.189
I started gathering all the paper
towel and toilet paper up.

29:27.190 --> 29:33.090
I had to make sure that there was
nothing that could catch fire.

29:39.252 --> 29:41.532
That was..

29:41.538 --> 29:44.341
The most frighting..

29:44.342 --> 29:46.982
Horrific thing..

29:47.261 --> 29:50.090
I've ever been through in my whole life.

29:50.091 --> 29:52.491
This thing..

29:53.986 --> 29:56.342
Attempted to..

29:56.343 --> 29:58.719
Burn my house down.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.179
With my daughter in it.

30:01.180 --> 30:03.460
That was..

30:04.234 --> 30:06.874
The last straw.

30:10.071 --> 30:13.131
We finally moved out.

30:13.180 --> 30:15.969
It was a huge relief.

30:15.970 --> 30:19.909
That I wasn't going to have
to deal with it anymore.

30:19.910 --> 30:25.670
That I was going to be able
to have a normal life again.

30:26.690 --> 30:32.590
The situation succeeded in finally
driving this wedge between Matt and I.

30:35.590 --> 30:38.470
We were separating.

30:56.836 --> 30:58.899
After we moved out..

30:58.900 --> 31:04.579
In the next 3 or 4 months the
next door neighbors also left.

31:04.580 --> 31:07.724
And there's 4 or 5 houses that
are vacant on that block.

31:07.725 --> 31:13.625
And it makes me wonder that maybe
perhaps it wasn't just us.

31:35.420 --> 31:39.320
I saw something I can't explain.

31:39.750 --> 31:45.390
I don't like the idea of not
being able to explain it.

31:55.348 --> 31:58.454
Back in 1997 I got call from,

31:58.455 --> 32:03.869
a friend of mine who was also the elected
Sheriff in a rural Oregon County.

32:03.870 --> 32:06.174
He knew that I had been a
certificated police officer.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.058
And I had been in the Marine Core.

32:08.059 --> 32:12.449
So he asked me if I wanted
to be a deputy Sheriff.

32:12.450 --> 32:14.649
I jumped at the chance.

32:14.650 --> 32:19.009
At the time I was fit, and at
the present I certainly am not.

32:19.010 --> 32:21.227
- Hey, man. Everything good?
- Charlie. You alright?

32:21.228 --> 32:23.119
Yeah, it's great I kept
the seat warm for you.

32:23.120 --> 32:28.249
On this particular day, I was
early getting off shift.

32:28.250 --> 32:33.999
It was one of the prettiest days I can ever
remember seeing in the Cascade Mountains.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.900
It made me want to take a hike.

32:39.420 --> 32:43.058
You can walk across country
where there are no trails.

32:43.059 --> 32:48.959
And probably be places in eastern Oregon
where nobody's ever even walked before.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.240
I loved that idea.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.599
I had been walking up hill
for 2 hours at least.

33:06.600 --> 33:11.760
It was taking a long time
because of the terrain.

33:16.690 --> 33:22.590
I decided to find a route that would
get me in to a more open area.

33:24.280 --> 33:30.040
When I looked through my compass
to take that measurement..

33:30.290 --> 33:33.410
I was totally shocked.

33:34.040 --> 33:39.940
I saw a person standing there, but
it was clearly was not human being.

34:02.220 --> 34:06.129
This thing had human like shape to it.

34:06.130 --> 34:09.565
And a clear place for the eyes,
and the nose, and the mouth.

34:09.567 --> 34:12.867
But it wasn't a person.

34:14.440 --> 34:18.280
He had his eyes directly on me.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.918
The weirdest thing happened.

34:23.920 --> 34:28.960
I just involuntarily cocked
my head to one side.

34:29.940 --> 34:33.179
He mimicked me. Exactly.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.049
He was smart.

34:36.050 --> 34:41.030
I instinctively reached
around to get my weapon.

34:43.730 --> 34:47.389
He ran away so fast it seemed impossible.

34:47.391 --> 34:51.498
Certainly physically
impossible for a human.

34:51.500 --> 34:56.420
I was so curious that I
had to check it out.

35:06.070 --> 35:11.970
I could see most of the wide open
area and was looking everywhere.

35:12.570 --> 35:15.439
There was nothing there.

35:15.440 --> 35:19.100
I decided to look for tracks.

35:19.660 --> 35:23.620
I couldn't find a track anywhere.

35:31.730 --> 35:37.630
I carried on walking for a while but
I was feeling a little nervous.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.474
It was darker than it should be for
me to back to the car before dark.

35:41.475 --> 35:44.069
And I didn't have a flashlight.

35:44.070 --> 35:47.334
I realized I wasn't going to make it
unless I turned around right then.

35:47.335 --> 35:49.615
So I did.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.357
I decided to take different route.

35:54.358 --> 36:00.069
So that I'd put some space between
myself and whatever that was.

36:00.070 --> 36:05.970
I was looking to my left because
that's the area that he had gone.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.880
And that's when I heard it.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.704
It was as loud as some
guns when they go off.

36:18.705 --> 36:20.569
It was a big tree.

36:20.570 --> 36:23.999
The snap came from my right.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.579
It was impossible.

36:26.580 --> 36:29.340
He'd circled me.

36:32.670 --> 36:38.570
The idea that I couldn't see him, but he
could see me, made me very uncomfortable.

36:39.026 --> 36:43.526
That's just a prescription for an ambush.

36:45.280 --> 36:49.360
That's when I heard a second snap.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.119
It wasn't just watching me,
or running away from me.

36:56.120 --> 36:59.060
He was tracking me.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.835
It flashed through my mind that
what I had seen was big enough,

37:02.836 --> 37:07.769
to snap me the same way it
was snapping those trees.

37:07.770 --> 37:12.379
I had been in the Marine Core.
I have police service.

37:12.380 --> 37:15.500
I don't scare easily.

37:18.050 --> 37:21.170
I am scared to death.

37:21.378 --> 37:23.898
Back off now!

37:28.360 --> 37:31.620
He started to get closer
as the sun went down.

37:31.621 --> 37:36.601
I knew because the snaps
started getting closer.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.659
It was hunting me.

37:40.660 --> 37:46.560
Getting closer and closer like a hunter,
but staying invisible to the prey.

37:47.260 --> 37:52.970
If you can't see what's out there you can't
fight it, you can't even run from it.

37:52.971 --> 37:58.099
You don't know which direction to
run now because he's circled you.

37:58.100 --> 38:03.980
Maybe you'll run right in to to his arms.
You don't know.

38:04.180 --> 38:09.259
I was rushing down the
hill and all of a sudden..

38:09.260 --> 38:13.089
There is a deer standing in front of me.

38:13.090 --> 38:17.710
It didn't have any fear of humans at all.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.709
She snapped her head over in the
direction that I had been watching.

38:22.710 --> 38:25.359
Where the snaps had been coming from.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.080
I scanned the whole tree line.

38:30.250 --> 38:31.959
Didn't see anything.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.780
No sound, nothing.

38:37.160 --> 38:41.420
She smelled the air with her head up.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.815
And then she bolted in
the opposite direction.

38:48.816 --> 38:53.256
As fast as I've ever seen a deer move.

38:54.250 --> 38:59.290
I felt the hair on the
back of my neck go up.

39:00.540 --> 39:04.080
I knew I was being watched.

39:07.580 --> 39:11.646
It was just so close,
and it was so obvious..

39:11.647 --> 39:15.367
That it didn't want me there.

39:17.690 --> 39:21.740
I was only about 2 minutes away
from the car, if I ran real fast..

39:21.741 --> 39:24.021
So I did.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.600
I heard snaps again.

39:28.710 --> 39:32.910
And this time they were really close.

39:43.660 --> 39:49.560
I was convinced that I was going to die
and I was going to die in a very bad way.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.961
When I finally saw my car,
I was hearing snaps,

39:54.962 --> 39:57.641
very close but they weren't frequent.

39:57.642 --> 40:03.462
And as I got real close to the
car, they stopped entirely.

40:03.810 --> 40:06.039
I remember now thinking..

40:06.040 --> 40:10.699
"Those snaps have stopped
because he's right behind me."

40:10.700 --> 40:14.120
"And he's gonna grab me."

40:24.470 --> 40:26.507
I remember now thinking..

40:26.508 --> 40:31.548
"He's right behind me and
he's gonna grab me."

40:34.930 --> 40:39.749
I stared hitting the button for the
automatic release of the locks.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.639
Come on!

40:41.640 --> 40:45.540
It's not going to open in time.

40:45.780 --> 40:49.980
My heart was starting to beat faster.

40:50.170 --> 40:55.990
I want to get steel between me
and whatever that thing is.

40:56.440 --> 41:01.660
I felt fear that I wasn't
going to get that far.

41:02.440 --> 41:05.260
Come on! Come on!

41:08.480 --> 41:12.260
I put the key in the ignition.

41:12.780 --> 41:15.660
It wouldn't start.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.990
It was like, what else could go wrong?

41:18.991 --> 41:21.151
Come on!

41:21.441 --> 41:24.081
Come on! Start!

41:40.190 --> 41:45.170
The sense of relief that
I felt was real good.

41:45.730 --> 41:51.130
The first thing I wanted to
do was have a cigarette.

41:56.350 --> 42:01.573
I didn't tell anybody but the
Sheriff that I served for.

42:01.574 --> 42:05.714
I didn't think he would believe me.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.267
He did believe me.

42:12.268 --> 42:15.088
He said there get reports of..

42:15.089 --> 42:19.879
Big, hairy, unknown animals
up there all the time.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.042
Don't talk to anyone!

42:21.043 --> 42:24.979
He told me don't write a
report, don't talk about it.

42:24.980 --> 42:27.500
So I didn't.

42:36.790 --> 42:38.909
What I saw was physical.

42:38.910 --> 42:42.250
It was some kind of living being.

42:42.251 --> 42:48.151
And, in my experience, living beings
have to multiply in some way.

42:48.810 --> 42:52.199
That means there's more of
them, I don't know how many.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.397
But I do know that I'm
not going back there.
