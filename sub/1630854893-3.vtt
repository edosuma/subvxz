00:00.520 --> 00:03.400
(audience murmurs)

00:06.000 --> 00:07.380
(footsteps approaching)

00:07.480 --> 00:08.220
Hey.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.060
You're late.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.140
I'm consistent.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.500
(audience applauds)

00:13.600 --> 00:15.340
Hello, and welcome to this Q&A.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.940
I'm delighted to say that I'm joined

00:17.040 --> 00:18.900
by one of our most talented, promising,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.540
and soon-to-be-in-demand young
actresses, Emma Lytleton.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.540
(audience applauds and cheers)

00:25.640 --> 00:26.820
Emma, thank you for joining us,

00:26.920 --> 00:29.180
and thank you for writing
that introduction.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.140
(audience laughs)

00:30.240 --> 00:31.860
My pleasure on both counts.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.980
(Emma chuckles)

00:33.080 --> 00:37.220
So, how do you feel
about your play opening?

00:37.320 --> 00:38.580
Terrified.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.020
Absolutely terrified.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.900
This is the biggest thing
that I've ever done.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.260
It is in fact the only remotely big thing

00:45.360 --> 00:48.660
that I've ever done, so, yeah, not great.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.140
Okay, and what were you in before this?

00:51.240 --> 00:52.140
Unemployment.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.580
(audience laughs)

00:53.680 --> 00:55.780
Right, and what kept
you going through that?

00:55.880 --> 00:56.660
Shame.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.300
Yeah.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.100
I think if you want to act,

01:00.200 --> 01:01.820
you have to have this burning desire

01:01.920 --> 01:03.780
deep inside to want to prove-

01:03.880 --> 01:04.620
Prove your mother wrong.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.540
Exactly!

01:05.640 --> 01:08.640
(audience applauds)

01:09.600 --> 01:12.200
(upbeat music)

01:16.560 --> 01:19.480
(soft vocalising)

01:40.880 --> 01:43.900
(water splashes)

01:44.000 --> 01:45.380
Joey, come on!

01:45.480 --> 01:47.740
(water splashes)

01:47.840 --> 01:49.840
Yeah!

01:51.880 --> 01:53.880
No!

01:57.360 --> 01:59.360
Yeah! Joey!

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
(slow string music)

02:09.200 --> 02:11.340
That went well.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.620
Yeah, I just wish I had said something-

02:13.720 --> 02:14.540
Interesting?

02:14.640 --> 02:15.580
Ideally, yeah.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.420
(chuckles)

02:17.520 --> 02:18.340
What are you doing now?

02:18.440 --> 02:20.380
I'll probably get the bus
home and panic about the play.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.700
(chuckles)

02:21.800 --> 02:22.660
Right.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.780
Whereabouts are you based?

02:23.880 --> 02:25.620
South, do you know Telegraph Hill?

02:25.720 --> 02:26.460
Yeah.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.300
That's where I live.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.140
Whereabouts?

02:28.240 --> 02:29.020
You know, at the north side.

02:29.120 --> 02:29.820
The rough end?

02:29.920 --> 02:31.260
Yeah.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.100
Nice.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.600
No, it really isn't, but...

02:37.000 --> 02:39.180
So, er, I have a question.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.420
You've asked me a few already.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.460
I know, but I'm still hoping

02:41.560 --> 02:42.740
that you might say something interesting.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.740
Seems unlikely, doesn't it?

02:43.840 --> 02:45.460
Yeah.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.820
Who's Joey?

02:46.920 --> 02:50.660
(slow sombre music)

02:50.760 --> 02:55.760
(water splashes)
(laughter)

02:56.200 --> 02:57.180
Sorry.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.540
Sorry, I just saw it on your necklace

02:58.640 --> 02:59.380
and I thought I'd ask.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.500
(phone buzzing)

03:01.600 --> 03:03.600
Oh, erm, I have to go.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.500
Giving up on me saying
something interesting?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.600
Had to.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.900
I was gonna buy you a
drink to say thank you.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Right.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.100
Er,

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
yeah, sorry.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.940
Sorry, I, I do have to go.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.280
Okay, well thanks anyway.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.400
You were

03:28.840 --> 03:30.820
funny.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.920
Yeah, so were you.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.660
Actually, erm, I've changed my mind.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.740
About me being funny?

03:38.840 --> 03:39.940
About you buying me that drink.

03:40.040 --> 03:40.860
Okay, great!

03:40.960 --> 03:42.620
Let's go.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.720
Yeah, why not?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.040
(dramatic music)

04:04.560 --> 04:06.800
(laughter)

04:07.760 --> 04:10.780
(indistinct)

04:10.880 --> 04:13.120
(laughter)

04:18.240 --> 04:20.300
So, what do you write about?

04:20.400 --> 04:22.060
I write a weekly column

04:22.160 --> 04:24.700
that is supposed to be
funny, but rarely is.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.980
So not proper journalism then?

04:26.080 --> 04:28.080
No. God, no.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.020
And you interview people?

04:31.120 --> 04:32.580
Sometimes.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.220
Anyone interesting?

04:34.320 --> 04:35.540
Not recently.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.880
(chuckles)

04:39.520 --> 04:41.520
I'm this way.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.980
I'm just across the park.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.540
I'll see you next time then.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.640
See you next time.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.840
(soft dramatic music)

05:00.960 --> 05:04.100
(birds chirping)

05:04.200 --> 05:06.940
(water rolling and splashing)

05:07.040 --> 05:08.820
(children laughing)

05:08.920 --> 05:11.640
(water sloshing)

05:24.280 --> 05:27.040
(water sloshing)

05:32.720 --> 05:34.260
Hi.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.460
Hi.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.560
That's my towel.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.020
Wait, what?

05:41.120 --> 05:43.120
You're using my towel.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.540
I can see that.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.580
I didn't know that when I picked it up.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.460
That would be-

05:48.560 --> 05:50.560
Weird.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.860
(laughter)

05:56.960 --> 05:58.300
I have no idea what to say next.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.500
Me neither.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.580
I'm Harry.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.680
I'm Emma.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.220
Oh, there, hey!

06:05.320 --> 06:06.020
Joey.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.980
What are you doing here?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.220
Oh, sorry, this is Harry.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.700
He used to go out with Kate,

06:10.800 --> 06:12.100
and Anna,

06:12.200 --> 06:13.900
and Olivia for a while.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.820
Not officially.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.020
Okay.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.460
How do you two?

06:18.560 --> 06:19.780
Oh, Emma's my sister.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.700
Yeah.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.040
(laughter)

06:25.320 --> 06:27.920
(phone buzzes)

06:28.800 --> 06:30.220
(sniffles)

06:30.320 --> 06:31.340
Hello?

06:31.440 --> 06:32.180
Hi Emma.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.660
It's Ben.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.980
(sniffles)

06:35.080 --> 06:36.220
Hi.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.220
Er,

06:38.320 --> 06:39.660
is now a bad time?

06:39.760 --> 06:40.740
No.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.180
Sorry. Just it sounded
like you were crying.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.620
No, I am.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.460
Erm,

06:45.560 --> 06:47.180
(sniffles)

06:47.280 --> 06:49.900
I'm watching Say Yes to the Dress.

06:50.000 --> 06:50.740
Ah.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.540
That's not good.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.620
(laughs)

06:53.720 --> 06:56.140
Yeah, so listen, erm,

06:56.240 --> 06:57.900
the last time we saw each other,

06:58.000 --> 06:58.740
you said

06:58.840 --> 06:59.980
"See you next time,"

07:00.080 --> 07:00.820
and,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.540
yeah, I mean,

07:02.640 --> 07:03.820
I mean this isn't very cool

07:03.920 --> 07:05.060
or indeed professional,

07:05.160 --> 07:05.980
but neither am I.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.980
So yeah, I, I, I just wanted to say

07:09.080 --> 07:11.660
for the avoidance of all doubt,

07:11.760 --> 07:14.840
I would like there to be a next time.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.880
So, so, yeah, erm,

07:20.640 --> 07:21.660
I, I, I was just wondering

07:21.760 --> 07:22.660
if you wanted to go for a drink.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.420
I'm sorry, Ben, I have gotta go.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.000
(phone beeps)

07:29.160 --> 07:31.060
(sighs deeply)

07:31.160 --> 07:34.160
(slow sombre music)

07:49.560 --> 07:53.720
(children laughing and squealing)

07:57.760 --> 08:00.760
(children laughing)

08:05.400 --> 08:07.720
(footsteps)

08:09.440 --> 08:11.440
Hi!

08:11.960 --> 08:12.980
Hi!

08:13.080 --> 08:14.100
Er, what are you doing here?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.020
I saw you across the park,

08:15.120 --> 08:17.200
and I thought I'd say hi.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.220
I'm sorry about the
other day on the phone.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.020
I didn't mean to be-

08:21.120 --> 08:22.580
Daddy!

08:22.680 --> 08:23.420
Have you got-

08:23.520 --> 08:24.220
Hello, mate.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.500
Daddy!

08:25.600 --> 08:26.700
Any more?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.800
Er. No.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.060
Who's this?

08:31.160 --> 08:33.560
Er, this is my friend Emma.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.140
Would you like to meet her?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.540
Okay, so Emma, this is Poppy,

08:39.640 --> 08:41.640
and this is Jack.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.340
No, we're not!

08:43.440 --> 08:44.860
Okay, well who are you then?

08:44.960 --> 08:45.940
He's Peter Pan.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.340
I'm curly,

08:47.440 --> 08:49.960
and he's one of the Lost Boys.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.180
I already knew that.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.260
Do you wanna know why?

08:54.360 --> 08:55.060
Why?

08:55.160 --> 08:56.500
Why?

08:56.600 --> 08:59.820
Because my name's not really Emma.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.900
It's Captain

09:01.000 --> 09:01.740
James!

09:01.840 --> 09:03.380
- Hook!
- Hook!

09:03.480 --> 09:04.980
(Poppy and Jack scream and squeal)

09:05.080 --> 09:06.900
I'm gonna get yer!

09:07.000 --> 09:11.360
(Poppy and Jack scream and squeal)

09:15.440 --> 09:16.780
My Mum comes down to help,

09:16.880 --> 09:18.980
but other than that,

09:19.080 --> 09:22.020
it's just been the three of us ever since.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.100
And I don't always tell people about them.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.200
Why?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.300
Don't want to tell a sad story.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.380
I don't want them to be a sad story.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.380
Have you ever written about it?

09:34.480 --> 09:35.300
(Jack) Emma!

09:35.400 --> 09:36.140
Yeah?

09:36.240 --> 09:36.940
Can you chase us?

09:37.040 --> 09:39.040
Can you chase us?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.740
Well, I have to go now,

09:44.840 --> 09:47.300
but whoever catches this magic sword

09:47.400 --> 09:49.220
is gonna be the new Captain Hook.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.620
Are you ready?

09:50.720 --> 09:51.460
One,

09:51.560 --> 09:52.300
two,

09:52.400 --> 09:53.140
three,

09:53.240 --> 09:55.240
go!

09:56.280 --> 09:58.940
Oh, and for the avoidance of all doubt,

09:59.040 --> 10:01.900
I would like to see you again.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.080
(lighthearted music)

10:11.960 --> 10:14.420
(soft piano playing)

10:14.520 --> 10:15.220
Oh, there she is.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.460
Emma!

10:16.560 --> 10:17.860
Oh!

10:17.960 --> 10:19.500
Oh. You look-

10:19.600 --> 10:21.420
Harassed, sweaty.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.140
Wonderful!

10:23.240 --> 10:25.460
I really don't, but I
appreciate the conceit.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.300
Yo.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.100
Yo.

10:27.200 --> 10:27.940
Happy birthday.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.780
Your necklace is ridiculous, by the way.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.900
Thank you. Mum got it for me.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.380
No one knows why.

10:33.480 --> 10:37.340
Maybe in case you
forget your own name me.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.340
So, I hear you met Harry.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.440
Er, yeah.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.220
He's nice, isn't he?

10:43.320 --> 10:46.020
Mother, stop foisting
my friends onto her.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.940
I'm just saying!

10:48.040 --> 10:50.820
It might be nice to have someone more

10:50.920 --> 10:52.580
reliable and dependable.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.540
(whispers) Reliable.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.380
Like Dad?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.580
Now, don't involve me in this.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.500
Because your career is-

10:57.600 --> 10:59.060
Dormant.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.540
Precarious, I was gonna say.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.100
So to meet someone reliable.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.500
I'd like to propose a toast to Joey.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.140
May you live a long and happy life,

11:07.240 --> 11:08.860
and may all your relationships

11:08.960 --> 11:09.980
be just like Mum and Dad's.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.860
Fueled by alcohol
and passive aggression.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.960
Cheers!

11:14.280 --> 11:15.020
[Everyone] Cheers!

11:15.120 --> 11:18.040
(glasses clinking)

11:19.960 --> 11:21.860
When we came in,

11:21.960 --> 11:22.700
one of the new waiters

11:22.800 --> 11:25.960
asked me if it was a special occasion.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.000
I said it was my daughter's birthday.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
Anyway,

11:37.120 --> 11:39.540
we all have a lot to look forward to.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.300
You have a lot to look forward to.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.500
And when I see you stood up there

11:44.600 --> 11:47.580
with everyone staring at you,

11:47.680 --> 11:49.500
I'll be so proud.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.340
I know. I just keep
thinking of Joey and-

11:52.440 --> 11:56.620
[All Waiters] ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

11:56.720 --> 12:01.820
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

12:01.920 --> 12:06.940
♪ Happy birthday, Happy birthday. ♪

12:07.040 --> 12:11.100
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

12:11.200 --> 12:13.440
(applause)

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
Happy birthday, Joe.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.540
(lighthearted upbeat music)

12:25.640 --> 12:27.220
How do I look?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.140
Available.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.500
I was going for urban sophisticate.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.020
Well, you've landed on slutty Sandy

12:31.120 --> 12:32.260
from the end of Grease.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.140
Do you know what I don't understand?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.980
The patriarchal conditioning
at the end of Grease?

12:37.080 --> 12:38.620
I do actually. I'm just redefining it.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.620
What I don't understand is

12:39.720 --> 12:40.500
why you were so desperate

12:40.600 --> 12:42.260
for me to come out with
you for a drink tonight?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.460
So, you know Harry?

12:43.560 --> 12:44.940
Yeah.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.060
Well, he has this friend, Cameron,

12:47.160 --> 12:48.940
who I've been messaging,

12:49.040 --> 12:52.340
and I'm gonna go meet
them tonight for a drink.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.100
And you're telling me this now because-

12:54.200 --> 12:55.380
Because if I told you any earlier,

12:55.480 --> 12:56.220
you would've said no.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.940
An accurate assessment.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.220
Yeah.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.260
Come on.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.180
What's the worst that could happen?

13:03.280 --> 13:06.040
(dramatic music)

13:22.880 --> 13:25.880
(music intensifies)

13:37.880 --> 13:41.100
(music slows and fades)

13:41.200 --> 13:44.500
That's all I've written so far.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.620
What do you think?

13:46.720 --> 13:48.720
Is it that bad?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.760
I, I, I just need to,

13:52.600 --> 13:54.820
I just need to find the right ending.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.540
You know.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.660
Like a way to say-

13:57.760 --> 13:59.260
I thought I'd never feel happy again,

13:59.360 --> 14:01.360
but I was wrong.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.900
Things can change,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.140
I can change.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.240
Something like that.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.320
Yeah, something like that.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.440
Do you think that's true?

14:17.080 --> 14:19.600
Do you think people can change

14:21.800 --> 14:23.140
after the worst, most unimaginable thing

14:23.240 --> 14:24.060
has happened to them?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.220
Do you really think
people can be happy again,

14:26.320 --> 14:28.840
the way that they were before?

14:31.800 --> 14:35.260
I don't think anything can
be the way it was before.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.700
I think you're probably right.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.440
Who else have you shown this to?

14:42.320 --> 14:44.300
No one.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.220
I mean just you.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.320
Don't know if I'm even gonna use it.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.080
I wanna tell you who Joey is.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
Joey is my sister,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
and she died.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.660
No one else I've ever spoken
to really understands it.

15:12.760 --> 15:13.940
Lucky them.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.300
You know when you tell someone,

15:16.400 --> 15:17.340
and they nod

15:17.440 --> 15:20.940
and start comparing it
to when their Nan died?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.980
Yeah. It is annoying, isn't it?

15:23.080 --> 15:25.140
Yeah.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.780
Thank you for telling me.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.040
(slow dramatic music)

15:37.400 --> 15:39.260
So, I became a writer

15:39.360 --> 15:42.220
because I have no other marketable skills.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.180
Can you cook?

15:43.280 --> 15:44.860
Nope.

15:44.960 --> 15:45.820
Can you drive?

15:45.920 --> 15:47.540
Not even nearly.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.540
How do you get Jack and Poppy around?

15:49.640 --> 15:51.640
With great difficulty.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.160
(sombre music)

16:01.600 --> 16:02.780
Are you alright?

16:02.880 --> 16:06.580
I used to swim here
all the time with Joey.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.160
And do you still swim here?

16:12.760 --> 16:14.940
So the way I see it,

16:15.040 --> 16:15.940
we could either go home,

16:16.040 --> 16:16.780
you to yours,

16:16.880 --> 16:18.740
and me back to the chaos

16:18.840 --> 16:22.420
of Lego and the disgruntled mother.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.700
Or,

16:24.800 --> 16:27.100
we could get another drink.

16:27.200 --> 16:27.900
Okay, wait.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.020
So let me flesh out the arguments-

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
You had me at drink.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.900
(slow dramatic music)

16:36.000 --> 16:38.280
(laughter)

16:39.520 --> 16:40.780
You know what's weird?

16:40.880 --> 16:41.700
How drunk I am?

16:41.800 --> 16:42.620
No, no.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.060
That was perfectly predictable.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.160
What's weird is

16:46.560 --> 16:49.460
how easy they make it to
get in when it's closed.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.460
What?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.260
Yeah, you just jump over.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.300
Come on, I'll show you.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
Absolutely not.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.100
What are you waiting for?

17:01.200 --> 17:03.960
(dramatic music)

17:15.520 --> 17:18.500
So, was this her special place?

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
No, she hated it.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.820
No, we came here all the time,

17:22.920 --> 17:24.920
and yeah, we loved it.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.060
We should do it together.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.620
I don't think so.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.720
I understand.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.860
It can be pretty
intimidating to stand next

17:34.960 --> 17:36.460
to me with my top off.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.380
(snickers)

17:37.480 --> 17:38.580
Hey, you laugh, but I'm telling you,

17:38.680 --> 17:40.140
you do not want to know

17:40.240 --> 17:41.940
what is going on under here.

17:42.040 --> 17:42.860
I'm shredded.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.960
I'm like coleslaw.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
I'm sure it's lovely.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.220
Right.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.340
What are you doing?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.140
I'm going in.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.140
Why?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.180
Because I kind of wanted to anyway,

17:56.280 --> 17:57.020
but if I do it now,

17:57.120 --> 17:58.540
then it'll seem like a grand gesture.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.800
Plus if I don't do it now,

18:01.680 --> 18:04.460
then I'm just the guy stood in his pants.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.180
Essentially, I've overcommitted too soon.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.260
Ben. No.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.340
Also by the way,

18:08.440 --> 18:10.540
once I'm in, you're coming in with me.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.540
Absolutely not!

18:11.640 --> 18:13.220
If you don't do it now,
then you'll never do it.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.540
Ben, no!

18:14.640 --> 18:15.780
(water splashing)

18:15.880 --> 18:17.860
(dramatic music)

18:17.960 --> 18:19.960
Woo! Emma, come on!

18:20.600 --> 18:21.380
Just do it!

18:21.480 --> 18:22.220
There's no way!

18:22.320 --> 18:23.180
Please. You won't regret it.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.860
Do it, or I'm getting out.

18:24.960 --> 18:25.740
Five,

18:25.840 --> 18:26.780
four,

18:26.880 --> 18:28.020
three,

18:28.120 --> 18:29.500
two, one.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.660
Come on!

18:30.760 --> 18:33.140
(water splashing)

18:33.240 --> 18:35.480
(laughter)

18:36.320 --> 18:39.760
(upbeat dramatic music)

18:41.320 --> 18:43.960
(uptempo music)

19:07.280 --> 19:08.780
I'm a little bit nervous,

19:08.880 --> 19:09.620
as I'm sure you can tell.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.260
And if you're thinking
that might manifest itself

19:11.360 --> 19:12.300
in some kind of poor performance,

19:12.400 --> 19:13.940
then that's probably not
an accurate assumption.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.300
Ben, stop talking.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
Okay.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.540
Was that your first time?

19:24.640 --> 19:25.900
I hate to point out the obvious,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.420
but,

19:27.520 --> 19:28.420
I've got two children.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.380
I meant, since-

19:29.480 --> 19:30.980
Yeah.

19:31.080 --> 19:31.980
Sorry.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.080
It's okay.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.660
You know, it's not like there's a

19:36.760 --> 19:37.980
handbook for all this.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.300
And yet, for so many years,

19:39.400 --> 19:41.980
Cosmopolitan magazine
had me believe otherwise.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.320
(laughter)

19:45.480 --> 19:47.480
I have to go soon.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.520
Not yet.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.460
(keys jangling)

19:55.560 --> 19:58.820
(television sounds)

19:58.920 --> 20:01.320
(door shuts)

20:03.520 --> 20:05.980
[Television] And its mother
will spend the next two years,

20:06.080 --> 20:08.960
taking care of her precious charge.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.340
(floor creaking)

20:16.440 --> 20:19.520
(lighthearted music)

20:41.200 --> 20:44.460
(children squealing)

20:44.560 --> 20:47.100
Guys. Come on. Enough now, please.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.220
Oi!

20:48.320 --> 20:50.320
In bed now!

20:51.240 --> 20:54.100
(children laughing and squealing)

20:54.200 --> 20:55.060
In you get.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.260
Thank you.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.420
(children laughing)

20:58.520 --> 21:01.120
(upbeat music)

21:02.280 --> 21:03.100
I'm going out.

21:03.200 --> 21:03.940
I love you.

21:04.040 --> 21:04.780
I love you.

21:04.880 --> 21:05.940
I'll see you the morning, right?

21:06.040 --> 21:06.740
Yes.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.620
Yes.

21:07.720 --> 21:11.420
Be good. Grandma's in the next room.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.600
(children squealing)

21:17.800 --> 21:18.580
Sorry I'm late.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.300
Sorry.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.900
There was a thing at bedtime.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.180
One was a cat, one was a dog.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.020
And they,

21:24.120 --> 21:25.020
and they didn't,

21:25.120 --> 21:26.780
anyway you wouldn't-

21:26.880 --> 21:28.220
Understand?

21:28.320 --> 21:30.140
Be interested. I was gonna say.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.900
Well, I would be.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.620
Okay. What would you wanna know?

21:34.720 --> 21:35.940
Who was the cat, and who was the dog?

21:36.040 --> 21:38.040
I've honestly no idea.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.740
Ever since the accident,

21:42.840 --> 21:44.220
I've tried pretty hard not to think

21:44.320 --> 21:46.320
about how I feel

21:46.760 --> 21:49.060
because it was dangerous

21:49.160 --> 21:51.160
for me.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.780
But when I'm with you, I feel happy.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.700
Which I know doesn't sound
like a lot, but it's,

21:57.800 --> 22:01.100
it's more than I ever expected to feel.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.500
The reason I asked is
because there are things

22:03.600 --> 22:06.540
that I want to tell you about me.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.380
Things that I've done

22:07.480 --> 22:08.660
that are hard for me to talk about,

22:08.760 --> 22:10.820
but,

22:10.920 --> 22:12.100
if this is what I think it is,

22:12.200 --> 22:14.540
I wanna talk about them with you.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.640
Okay.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.640
Ben, this isn't easy.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.220
Is it about Joey?

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
A bit, yeah.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.600
(phone buzzing)

22:30.520 --> 22:31.660
You should just take it.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.420
I'm gonna use the loo.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.200
(phone buzzing)

22:39.440 --> 22:41.440
Hi Mum, what is it?

22:42.520 --> 22:44.340
Wait, what's happened?

22:44.440 --> 22:47.160
(dramatic music)

22:55.920 --> 22:58.600
(intense music)

23:14.560 --> 23:15.740
What, what's happening?

23:15.840 --> 23:18.380
Which one's not breathing?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.240
[Ben] You're gonna be all right!

23:19.240 --> 23:21.400
Don't leave them alone!

23:23.240 --> 23:24.540
They're in the children's ward.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.640
Thank you.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.580
[Poppy and Jack] Daddy!

23:29.680 --> 23:31.980
Hey, hey, Jack Attack.

23:32.080 --> 23:32.900
Are you alright

23:33.000 --> 23:34.020
I had an accident, Daddy.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.500
They were playing that
bloody cat and dog game,

23:35.600 --> 23:36.400
and he hit his head on the radiator.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.740
Yeah, I know.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.380
We're okay now.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.740
Yeah. Yeah.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.260
We're all okay?

23:42.360 --> 23:45.540
Hey look, I'm so sorry, you guys.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.580
I'm never gonna leave
you like that ever again.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.460
Okay?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.560
Come here.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.080
Daddy's here.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.580
Hey.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.920
(dramatic piano music)

24:03.280 --> 24:05.280
Thanks.

24:08.120 --> 24:12.580
You know, I've seen you
all in here a few times,

24:12.680 --> 24:14.220
and I always want to come over

24:14.320 --> 24:16.560
to tell you how sorry I am.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.180
(tongue clicks)

24:19.280 --> 24:21.760
I still think about their Mum.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.720
If she could see you all now

24:26.760 --> 24:28.140
and see the beautiful people

24:28.240 --> 24:31.100
you've helped her children become,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.600
I think she'd be really proud

24:34.960 --> 24:37.820
cause I'd be really proud.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.920
Thank you.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.260
Do me a favour.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.460
Whatever it is the three
of you have been doing,

24:48.560 --> 24:50.060
keep doing it.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.240
(sombre piano music)

25:10.160 --> 25:13.040
(uplifting music)

25:18.480 --> 25:19.220
Hey.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.340
Hey.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.260
Sorry to bother you at work.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.740
No, it's fine. I'm on a break.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.460
Yeah,

25:24.560 --> 25:26.500
it's just that I wanted to speak to you,

25:26.600 --> 25:27.860
and I didn't wanna do it over the phone.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.100
I got your message. How is Jack?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.820
Yeah, yeah, he's fine now.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.540
Good. I was worried
when you left, I thought-

25:33.640 --> 25:34.380
Yeah, I know,

25:34.480 --> 25:36.020
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.060
Erm, but that's not why I'm here.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.220
Okay. Look, I haven't really slept,

25:39.320 --> 25:40.980
and I'm sure that you haven't either,

25:41.080 --> 25:42.860
but last night I was trying
to tell you something.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.960
I need to talk to you.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.980
About?

25:48.080 --> 25:50.080
Us.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.300
Look, erm,

25:53.400 --> 25:55.780
look, my life is complicated and-

25:55.880 --> 25:56.820
I know it is, but-

25:56.920 --> 26:00.500
Yeah. And, and I, I, I, I
wanna be honest with you, right?

26:00.600 --> 26:01.940
I, I think I'm falling
in love with you, and

26:02.040 --> 26:04.180
and, and I can't do that.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.620
And, and, and this.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.500
The children.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.260
Yeah. Yeah.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.020
I'm, I'm, I'm barely holding
it together as it is, and

26:12.120 --> 26:16.380
and I don't think I
can lose someone again,

26:16.480 --> 26:18.460
so,

26:18.560 --> 26:20.420
need to stop it now

26:20.520 --> 26:22.520
before that happens.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.060
Fine.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.140
Just go.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.580
No, Emma, I don't wanna just go. I want-

26:28.680 --> 26:30.380
I said just go, please.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.120
(sombre music)
