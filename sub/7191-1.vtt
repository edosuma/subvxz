DANIEL: You feeling better?

19:54.568 --> 19:55.444
- Like a brand-new girl.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.739
- So what were you
doing out there?

19:58.822 --> 20:00.616
- I'm a lifeguard
over at White Surf.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.827
I saw a watercraft drifting
and I swam over to get it.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.164
I was driving it back
when something happened

20:07.247 --> 20:08.457
and I got disoriented.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.249
- It happens.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.627
The sun, it can get to you.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.795
- Like last week it was so hot

20:13.879 --> 20:16.131
Diego walked home
in the wrong direction.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.466
- It was hot, okay.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.259
The humidity was 99% then.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.678
- He was halfway to Key West
before he realized.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.098
- No.
This was different.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.017
It almost felt like...
magic.

DANIEL: What?

20:29.645 --> 20:32.064
- That's crazy.
- That's whack.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.274
- Yeah, you're right.
It was probably nothing.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.359
- Uh, we gotta go.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

20:41.949 --> 20:42.824
- The Council's
really mad at me.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.117
- Yeah, they should be,

20:44.201 --> 20:45.494
after what Maddie did to me.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.161
- How is that my fault?

20:46.244 --> 20:48.121
- You stopped time.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.498
I froze and I couldn't
defend myself

20:49.581 --> 20:51.708
when Maddie assaulted
me with eye shadow.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.419
I--I mean, don't worry.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.879
It was a complete accident.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.172
I'm sure the Council
will understand.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.715
- I just have to make sure
I don't slip up again.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.926
- Don't worry.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.386
Besides, it's not like
you could do much worse

21:02.469 --> 21:04.638
on the Great Miami
Time-Stoppage.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.223
- You gave it a name?

21:06.306 --> 21:07.265
- Yeah, I know,
it's really good, right?

21:07.349 --> 21:10.185
Wait, all right,
what do you prefer?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.145
The Freaky Frozenness Hour?

21:12.229 --> 21:15.148
Or the Frozen Miami
or like...

21:16.191 --> 21:17.192
What?

21:20.946 --> 21:24.074
- Oh, Emma, watch out.

21:24.157 --> 21:27.077
Don't trip and cast a spell
in plain daylight.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.788
- Whoo!
- [gasps]

21:29.871 --> 21:31.957
- Ow.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.210
- Emma!

21:35.293 --> 21:37.254
- I--I didn't do it.
I--I promise.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.214
I--I know it looks
like I did but--

21:39.298 --> 21:41.925
- That's it.
That is the last straw!

21:42.968 --> 21:44.761
- What?
No, I didn't do it.
