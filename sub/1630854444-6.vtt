00:24.375 --> 00:25.416
Ada!

00:32.875 --> 00:34.083
Ada!

00:41.000 --> 00:42.083
Ada!

00:43.500 --> 00:44.500
Where are you?

00:44.583 --> 00:46.041
Come and get me.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.791
It's not funny anymore.
We need to go home now.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.250
Come and get me.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.166
Gotcha.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.458
Nothing. No reply.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.458
Where's the boy?

01:36.750 --> 01:38.125
My mother was right.

01:38.708 --> 01:41.583
The boy is the cause!
That they're all dead!

01:41.666 --> 01:42.958
Krester and Ada!

01:43.916 --> 01:45.875
What's happening?

01:48.583 --> 01:50.125
Tove, stop.

02:17.291 --> 02:19.708
The engine room. Fire up the engines.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.500
Show them how the telegraph works.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.666
What did he say?

02:31.750 --> 02:34.291
We will send
a distress signal with our coordinates.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.500
-Clémence?
-We need to leave with Madam Wilson.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.583
It's okay now.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.583
Is anyone there?

06:06.916 --> 06:07.958
Hello?

06:12.916 --> 06:14.583
Come and get me.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.750
Did you hear that?

06:16.791 --> 06:17.875
Mother?

06:18.375 --> 06:19.375
What?

06:20.208 --> 06:21.833
I thought I heard something.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.458
You believe me now. Don't you?

06:26.583 --> 06:27.583
It's all true.

06:28.291 --> 06:30.166
You are chosen.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.625
Mother. Stop.

07:18.416 --> 07:20.000
What is that thing?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.333
It's strange. It wasn't there before.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.250
What is he saying?

07:27.833 --> 07:30.791
Could someone please explain
what the fuck is happening?

07:30.875 --> 07:32.916
I've never seen anything like that before.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.083
What's going on here?

07:48.750 --> 07:52.458
Enough. I want to get off this ship.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.541
There's no one here.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.125
It's a waste of time.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.375
When are you due?

11:03.791 --> 11:05.250
Two months.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.833
I always wanted children.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.666
Lots of children.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.208
Until my sister had her first two.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.916
They're quite annoying, to be honest.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
But, well…

11:25.708 --> 11:29.875
I suppose it's like all those things
you want so badly when you're little.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.333
Fall in love.

11:33.250 --> 11:36.000
Get married. Have children.

11:37.416 --> 11:38.583
It always ends up being

11:38.666 --> 11:40.916
the complete opposite
of what you imagined.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.666
I admire you.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.166
You seem so strong.

11:52.541 --> 11:53.666
So free.

12:01.666 --> 12:02.916
I feel ridiculous.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.458
Do you know what they say?

12:19.708 --> 12:23.125
That men invented dresses and heels

12:23.208 --> 12:25.541
so that women can't run away.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.083
I don't like this one bit.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.375
Okay,
we have to make the fire on both sides.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.208
Fuck.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.625
You think I'll stay down there with them?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.708
You must be crazy.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.333
It gets stuck all the time.

14:16.416 --> 14:17.541
Let me help.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.708
Thanks.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.166
Is this yours?

14:53.291 --> 14:55.083
Is this from a girl?

15:05.250 --> 15:06.416
My brother.

15:09.541 --> 15:13.208
He lives in America, and…

15:16.833 --> 15:18.125
It's a long story.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.666
You're so different from other men.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.125
I am sorry.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.000
Hey!

20:49.625 --> 20:50.666
Where are you going?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.625
It's pointless.
We're not going to reach anyone.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.583
Hey, wait!

21:12.833 --> 21:14.250
I'm sorry for your loss.

21:24.666 --> 21:26.833
I never wanted to be a priest.

21:29.958 --> 21:31.250
I was a farmer.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.208
Like my father before me,
and his father before him.

21:39.791 --> 21:43.750
And we didn't have a lot of money,
but we were happy.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.958
But then something happened.

21:51.083 --> 21:55.666
After that, Iben, my wife,

21:55.750 --> 21:57.708
she started to hear God's voice.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.625
He told her that…

22:05.125 --> 22:06.875
He had other plans for us.

22:07.375 --> 22:08.666
Bigger plans.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.541
It gave her hope
when everything seemed hopeless, and I…

22:17.958 --> 22:20.875
And I wanted so badly
to feel the same hope.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.166
But most of all…

22:30.166 --> 22:32.750
I just wanted her to be happy.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.750
But I'm a liar.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.583
I've never heard His voice.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.041
And if I'm honest…

22:52.000 --> 22:53.916
I don't believe He exists.

23:03.791 --> 23:05.250
I don't know.

23:09.625 --> 23:11.708
All your sins will be forgiven.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.500
All your sins will be forgiven.

23:23.833 --> 23:24.833
Thanks.

23:57.666 --> 24:00.000
They say we should write our own story.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.458
But that's not true.
It has already been written.

24:06.416 --> 24:08.208
God writes our story.

24:10.083 --> 24:12.833
There's nothing you can do
but to accept His choices.

24:15.833 --> 24:19.083
Everything that happens
is part of His plan.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.000
No one here either.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.666
Did you see that?

25:45.750 --> 25:47.000
What did you say?

25:48.541 --> 25:49.791
Wait, where are you going?

25:57.041 --> 25:58.083
Hello?

26:00.375 --> 26:01.458
Is anyone there?

26:07.208 --> 26:08.291
Krester.

26:18.375 --> 26:19.500
Krester!

26:59.125 --> 27:00.041
Krester.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.083
I've been waiting for you.

27:17.833 --> 27:18.875
No!

27:34.500 --> 27:36.083
What's going on?

27:38.125 --> 27:39.791
Easy. Easy.

27:40.375 --> 27:41.333
Calm down.

27:43.833 --> 27:44.833
It's me.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.333
I've been looking for you.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.083
Tove, what's going on?

28:17.416 --> 28:19.375
Let's continue on the lower deck.

31:32.583 --> 31:33.916
Are you okay?

31:38.833 --> 31:41.500
I'll give you a minute.
I'm going to find the others. Okay?

32:03.833 --> 32:04.916
Hello?

32:09.125 --> 32:10.166
Is anyone there?

32:35.041 --> 32:36.041
Krester?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.333
Krester, is that you?

32:45.541 --> 32:46.416
Remember me?

33:35.625 --> 33:37.041
Look who we have here.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.541
But one of you is still missing.

33:45.041 --> 33:46.375
Where's your sister?

33:50.666 --> 33:53.083
In school. She's in school.

33:53.666 --> 33:54.583
Krester?

33:56.208 --> 33:57.291
Krester?

33:59.416 --> 34:01.083
I'm curious to hear your opinion.

34:02.125 --> 34:06.125
Do you think
telling the truth is a virtue?

34:07.208 --> 34:09.291
Yes. Yes, I think so.

34:09.375 --> 34:10.375
Yes.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.750
And do you think telling a lie is a sin?

34:16.916 --> 34:20.916
And do you agree with me
that one should be punished for a sin?

34:23.000 --> 34:26.291
-I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know.
- Wait.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.750
Listen. Listen to me.

34:28.833 --> 34:32.166
I'm sure we can come
to an agreement on this!

34:44.666 --> 34:47.958
Your son stole something from me.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.583
And now he's lying about it.

34:50.916 --> 34:56.416
I cannot have people working for me
on my land who don't have any values.

35:05.041 --> 35:08.958
You touched my son and took his innocence.

35:10.750 --> 35:13.416
And now I take something
from all of you in return.

35:13.500 --> 35:14.916
I'm sorry.

35:15.000 --> 35:15.875
I'm begging you.

36:59.416 --> 37:01.541
Tove! I heard you screaming.

37:02.458 --> 37:03.750
Are you okay?

37:05.875 --> 37:07.791
What happened? What happened?

37:08.583 --> 37:09.791
What is it?

37:11.541 --> 37:13.625
Is that blood? Tove?

37:41.416 --> 37:43.208
You probably won't believe me,

37:43.833 --> 37:44.666
but I'm sorry.

37:45.875 --> 37:46.958
About everything.

37:49.708 --> 37:52.375
Everything? Really?

37:56.708 --> 37:58.625
You're sorry for being a fucking liar?

37:59.583 --> 38:01.750
You're sorry for turning me in
as a deserter?

38:04.041 --> 38:04.958
Well…

38:06.000 --> 38:07.708
You got what you wanted.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.916
That's where you're wrong.

38:15.916 --> 38:17.375
I didn't get what I wanted.

38:17.875 --> 38:19.500
I got what I deserve.

38:24.708 --> 38:26.458
There's something inside my head.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.208
I might only have a few days left.

38:30.250 --> 38:33.166
That's why I need to go to America.
There's a doctor there.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.541
He's going to try and operate,
get this thing out.

38:36.833 --> 38:39.250
He's never done it
on someone who's still alive.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.791
But hey, you never know.

38:41.833 --> 38:44.666
See? Your wish came true.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.208
The only thing you wanted
was to see me dead.

38:49.708 --> 38:52.000
Fate is taking care of that for you now.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.458
It's working again.

39:05.791 --> 39:06.916
We did it.

39:09.291 --> 39:10.250
It works.

39:31.916 --> 39:33.583
They've made it.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.958
They've made it! It's moving again!

39:45.208 --> 39:46.666
Who's steering the ship?

39:46.750 --> 39:47.750
Hmm?

39:48.416 --> 39:52.000
The man who left before,
shouldn't he be here steering the ship?

39:52.083 --> 39:54.000
You're right.

39:54.083 --> 39:55.083
Where are we going?

40:05.291 --> 40:07.208
Forty-three north…

40:07.291 --> 40:09.333
We have to figure out
how to steer this ship.

40:10.125 --> 40:14.958
Forty-three north, 53 west.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.291
Here. Here there is land.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.375
Now what?

40:25.083 --> 40:26.041
You must be kidding.

40:26.125 --> 40:28.541
You want to learn
how to steer a ship by reading?

40:31.208 --> 40:32.625
It won't work.

40:47.916 --> 40:49.708
All the pages are covered with it.

40:50.375 --> 40:51.666
It's all it says.

40:56.875 --> 40:58.250
What does it mean?

49:00.291 --> 49:01.916
They're all dead.

49:05.666 --> 49:06.833
We are on our own.

49:23.791 --> 49:25.166
This can't be real.
