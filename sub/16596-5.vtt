(bell rings)

00:08.609 --> 00:10.342
Falcon,
we need your help!

00:10.344 --> 00:12.311
I'm here for ya, finch.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.381
The cafeteria's serving
shawarma and enchiladas.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.682
Which should we choose?

00:16.684 --> 00:20.552
The answer is an enchilada
stuffed with shawarma:

00:20.554 --> 00:23.188
The shawarm-ilada.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.358
I don't even have
to taste that to know
that it's amazing.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.996
I never believed falcon would
last this long.

00:30.998 --> 00:34.266
But they eat up every word
i say like it's candy.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.080
Is that a "hey, you're
so cool" slow clap

00:48.082 --> 00:52.217
Or a "hey,
i'm mocking you"
slow clap?

00:52.219 --> 00:56.955
A slow clap is always
"hey, i'm mocking you."

00:58.325 --> 01:02.461
But i guess you don't know that
because you're soooooo cool.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.365
You got yourself
a name, slow clapper?

01:06.367 --> 01:09.835
My name's skeeter.
I'm the coolest kid at booms.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.372
At least i was,
until you took my place
while i was away at space camp.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.540
(scoffs)

01:14.542 --> 01:17.276
The coolest kid at booms
went to space camp?

01:17.278 --> 01:20.612
And i was the coolest kid
there, too.

01:20.614 --> 01:24.349
Well, then i guess booms
has two cool guys.

01:24.351 --> 01:27.753
You're not as cool
as you pretend to be,

01:27.755 --> 01:30.289
Joseph<i> gilligan</i> rooney.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.126
How did you find out
my middle name?!

01:34.128 --> 01:36.295
Not that that
is my middle name,

01:36.297 --> 01:38.864
'cause it's not...

01:38.866 --> 01:42.434
Unless it is,
but i... I doubt it.

01:43.404 --> 01:46.605
Soon, i'll uncover
all your secrets,

01:46.607 --> 01:50.876
And i will take you down.

01:57.384 --> 02:00.986
You must have really worked on
your slow claps at space camp.

03:13.127 --> 03:15.194
Okay, new girl,

03:15.196 --> 03:16.361
Now's your chance

03:16.363 --> 03:17.563
To prove you're one of us.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.498
(snaps fingers)

03:19.500 --> 03:22.401
This is a month's worth
of toenail clippings.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.669
Gross!

03:23.671 --> 03:25.704
Put them
in stephanie's soup.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.539
Why would i do that?

03:27.541 --> 03:31.043
Two reasons: Every new kid
punks the dorm big sis.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.645
And the girl
who tells you what to do

03:33.647 --> 03:37.182
Just told you to do it.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.519
<i>So, do i punk</i>
<i>stephanie einstein,</i>

03:40.521 --> 03:43.055
<i>The one person who's been</i>
<i>nice to me,</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:46.725

03:46.727 --> 03:49.194
<i>To stick it in her eye?</i>

03:49.196 --> 03:51.897
Gimme the toenails.

03:55.536 --> 03:59.438
<i>Come on, people,</i>
<i>it's all about survival.</i>

04:01.008 --> 04:02.574

04:03.677 --> 04:05.444
Mmm!

04:05.446 --> 04:07.579
(crunching)

04:07.581 --> 04:09.748
Mm! Whoa!

04:09.750 --> 04:11.416
Crunchy croutons today.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.585
Ha ha!

04:13.587 --> 04:16.555
(crunching)

04:16.557 --> 04:18.156
Wait a second.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.626
These aren't croutons.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.294
I've been...

04:22.296 --> 04:24.196
Toenailed!

04:24.198 --> 04:26.198
(laughter)

04:27.434 --> 04:28.533
-Cut!
-(bell rings)

04:28.535 --> 04:30.435
Yay!

04:30.437 --> 04:33.605
Great scene, priya,
and you, too, ruby.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.374
Look at you
girls go.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.576

04:41.615 --> 04:44.583
On my old show,

04:44.585 --> 04:46.485
I made
such great friendships.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.955
I really hope that ruby
can make some.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.125
Maybe she and priya will end up
being best friends for life.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.393
(gasps)

04:54.395 --> 04:56.595
Did you just feel that tingle?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.630
I have goose bumps.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.135
So, what are you two
gonna do between takes, huh?

05:03.137 --> 05:06.104
You gonna get
into some mischief?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.773
You gonna pull
some pranks?

05:07.775 --> 05:10.642
You two gonna become
best friends?

05:11.645 --> 05:14.813
Actually, i need
to learn my lines.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.848
Yep, i don't have time
to goof around.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.117
Well, uh...
Okay, wait.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.286
Hold on, hold on.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.021
I mean,
there's always time

05:23.023 --> 05:26.591
For costars to make
lifelong friendships.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.694
I already have
a best friend.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.295
It's my pet rat.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.863
Bye.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.632
Bye.

05:33.634 --> 05:37.669
So... Wow.
Priya seems fun, huh?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.304
Huh?

05:39.306 --> 05:40.906
Huh?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.609
Liv, what are you doing?

05:44.611 --> 05:46.812
No, i'm not doing anything.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.547
It's just, now
that you're on the show,

05:48.549 --> 05:50.716
You're going to be
spending so much less time

05:50.718 --> 05:52.050
With your old friends,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.186
And you're going to be
working with priya.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.556
So, why don't you two,
uh, hang out, huh?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.491
Huh?

05:59.493 --> 06:01.193
Huh?

06:02.196 --> 06:04.396
But, i don't really
know her.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.531
I mean, not yet.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.400
What do you say that
after lunch,

06:08.402 --> 06:10.168
You, me, and priya
go to wardrobe

06:10.170 --> 06:12.337
And try on
every outfit ever?

06:12.339 --> 06:13.572
I hear they have
frog costumes.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.906
How fun is that?

06:14.908 --> 06:19.311
We'll see,<i> if</i> i have time
after i learn my lines,

06:19.313 --> 06:21.713
My dance steps,
and do my math homework.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.415
I'm a busy girl, liv.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.053
Hey, gemma.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.723
So, um...

06:31.725 --> 06:35.227
Priya and ruby
don't seem to really want
to have fun together.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.996
They're taking
their jobs like
so seriously.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.566
Serious is good.
We're making a tv show.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.436
You know, uh, they flinch
when i walk by.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.637
I love them.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.908
It's just, like,
on the old show,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.710
I put so much
pressure on myself

06:51.712 --> 06:55.447
And having a bff there
helped me to have fun,

06:55.449 --> 06:57.582
And i just
so want that for ruby.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.884
You know.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.687
South salamanca and i
used to drive golf carts
around the lot,

07:02.689 --> 07:05.857
And we used to dance
around and sing
in old wigs,

07:05.859 --> 07:09.761
And we used to have
slumber parties
on the set.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.097
You had me
until "old wigs."

07:12.099 --> 07:14.099
That's disgusting.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.740
Maddie, would you like
a fresh-baked muffin?

07:21.742 --> 07:24.643
Um, have you met me?

07:26.046 --> 07:29.047
Yes! Bam! Muffin!

07:32.619 --> 07:34.753
Noooo!

07:34.755 --> 07:37.756
That is so gross.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.758
Your aunt dena's experimenting
in the kitchen again.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.961
And this one is a spelt
chia-spinach muffin.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.063
That explains why
it is so gross!

07:45.065 --> 07:47.666
Exactly. I told her
that i would try them,

07:47.668 --> 07:50.335
But i cannot
choke them down.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.672
Dena, oh, ate
the whole muffin --
delish!

07:55.676 --> 07:56.775
Mom, i can't eat this.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.443
-Then hide it somewhere.
-What?

07:58.445 --> 08:00.679
Another home run, dena!

08:01.615 --> 08:03.949
Aah! What?

08:03.951 --> 08:06.651
Where am i
supposed to hide this?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.855
Ohh!

08:12.426 --> 08:14.359
Whaa! No!

08:16.864 --> 08:19.731
Hey... Maddie.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.502
Parker, are you digging
tunnels again?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.538
No. Bye.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.575
Okay, okay.
Hold it, shawshank.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.713
You promised that you
were gonna stop this!

08:34.715 --> 08:37.716
I did, but then i helped
ruby build a sand castle,

08:37.718 --> 08:40.552
And it all
came rushing back.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.388
I was born to dig.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.459
Parker, you
literally destroyed

08:47.461 --> 08:49.361
Our home in wisconsin
with your tunnels.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.795
Have you not learned
your lesson yet?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.797
Yes. I made
these tunnels safe.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.600
I used titanium beams
and da vinci arches.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.736
You gotta see her.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.538
She's a beaut.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.974
I mean... There is
nothing in this world

09:02.976 --> 09:04.910
That could make me want
to get in those tunnels
right now.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.346
Karen: Maddie, your aunt dena
made cheese out of seaweed.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.415
Wanna try some?

09:11.585 --> 09:12.884
Get in the hole.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.365
Hey.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.767
Hey.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.335
(tires screech)

09:30.337 --> 09:31.469
Heyyy!

09:33.373 --> 09:36.107
I am creating
a bonding environment

09:36.109 --> 09:37.709
For ruby and priya.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.878
It may look like i'm driving
a golf cart,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.380
But really,
i'm driving the fun train.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.949
Destination...

09:43.951 --> 09:45.750
Best friend city.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.086
Chug-a chug-a chug-a chug-a...

09:48.088 --> 09:50.589
Who is ready for fun?!

09:50.591 --> 09:52.490
Punch it, liv!

09:53.961 --> 09:57.128
Yeaaaah!

10:01.535 --> 10:04.135
So, i may have run
the battery down.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.739
Just give me a minute
to plug this baby in

10:07.741 --> 10:11.876
And in six hours,
we will be
whooping it up!

10:11.878 --> 10:13.411
That's okay.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.981
I should finish
studying my lines for
the next scene, anyway.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.116
Yeah, i've got
a song to learn.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.152
Oh, wait, okay, hold on.
Guys, guys!

10:21.154 --> 10:23.388
Just...

10:23.390 --> 10:24.990
If you were at home right now,

10:24.992 --> 10:27.759
What would you be doing
to have fun?

10:27.761 --> 10:30.261
Me and my friends
like slumber parties.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.797
I love slumber parties!

10:32.799 --> 10:35.066
Yeah, ya do?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.835
What am i seeing right now?

10:36.837 --> 10:39.938
Did you two just become
best friends?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.940
Pretty sure
all that happened was

10:41.942 --> 10:45.010
We both agreed we
liked slumber parties.

10:45.012 --> 10:49.014
Well, i mean, hey,
i like slumber parties, too.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.815
Are you guys thinking what
i'm thinking right now?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.018
Probably not.
You're kind of
a wild card.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.588
Wild is right.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.758
Who wants to have a slumber
party here on set tonight?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.460
Are you serious?

11:02.462 --> 11:03.695
No way!

11:03.697 --> 11:05.263
Are we gonna dance?

11:05.265 --> 11:06.865
Are we gonna do
each other's hair?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.500
Are we
gonna eat waffles?

11:08.502 --> 11:10.435
Somebody tell me
what we're gonna do?

11:11.538 --> 11:14.439
Okay, first thing we're
gonna do is calm down.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.777
And then get excited 'cause
we're having a slumber party
on the set!

11:18.779 --> 11:21.246
(screeching)

11:25.986 --> 11:29.054
Looks like you got yourself
a new wallpaper, kid.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.026
Good idea,
taking that photo.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.596
Now there's a record
of the last day
you were cool.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.468
Skeeter, i'm afraid we got
off on the wrong foot.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.803
Hello.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.972
I am falcon,
and i come in peace.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.542
I come for war.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.381
Tonight i will
scour the internet
to find your secrets

11:56.383 --> 11:59.617
And tomorrow,
the falcon
goes down.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.756
You know,
if you take me down,

12:04.758 --> 12:06.825
You won't have
a nemesis anymore.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.961
Oh, i make
enemies quickly.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.068
Falcon, you look concerned.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.972
I've never seen that before.
Is the planet okay?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.242
Finch...

12:24.244 --> 12:26.945
You deserve
the truth.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.080
You know me as
falcon, but...

12:29.082 --> 12:32.884
At my old school,
i was...

12:32.886 --> 12:34.252
Uncool.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.088
How uncool?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.057
Well, i wore
kitty cat t-shirts.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.959
That's not so bad.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.028
(squeaky) and this is
my real voice.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.965
Finch,
falcon's not real.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.433
I'm just joey rooney,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.535
And soon the entire
school will know.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.903
How?

12:51.905 --> 12:55.273
Some kid named skeeter,
he wants to expose me.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.709
Wait, skeeter's back
from space camp?

12:57.711 --> 13:01.446
It's cool against cool.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.148
He's gonna go online
and dig up

13:03.150 --> 13:04.949
My secret
uncool past.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.752
Not on my watch, falcon.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.154
Come here.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.728
Wh-what are you doing?

13:16.730 --> 13:18.263
Erasing your past.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.265
My supercomputer
will scan the internet

13:20.267 --> 13:22.133
And delete all things
joey rooney.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.134
I'll need your middle name.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.004
Oh, um...
It's, uh...

13:26.006 --> 13:27.906
It's...

13:27.908 --> 13:29.140
Gilligan?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.210
Not gonna lie --
that stinks.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.747
So, why are you
doing this for me?

13:36.917 --> 13:38.983
When skeeter
was the cool kid,
i was nothing.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.921
Under the falcon regime,
i am number two.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.088
And you're my friend.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.958
Oh... Thanks, finch.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.993
Can you say that
as falcon?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.765
(deep voice)
thanks, finch.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.874
Behold.
Parker tunnels west.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.609
Ohh!

14:04.611 --> 14:06.110
Wow!

14:06.112 --> 14:08.129
That's all you got?

14:08.130 --> 14:10.147
How about, the walls are
a nice shade of genius.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.718
The floors are waxed with
"how you like me now?"

14:13.720 --> 14:15.486
And the reinforced
steel beams are all,

14:15.488 --> 14:18.223
"you better ask somebody!"

14:18.225 --> 14:20.325
Yeah, i really
hate to admit it,

14:20.327 --> 14:21.793
But this does look...

14:21.795 --> 14:24.662
A lot more solid
than your old
parker tunnels.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.099
Yep, this time i focused
on making them 100% safe.

14:30.837 --> 14:34.038
Aaaah! Water!
What do we do?

14:37.143 --> 14:40.111
Oh, that was
a surprisingly simple fix.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.649
What... Where is
this water coming from?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.251
Uh...

14:46.253 --> 14:48.152
The... The ocean?

14:48.154 --> 14:50.054
That's a stab
in the dark.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.856
(scoffs)

14:51.858 --> 14:55.727
You built tunnels
under the ocean?

14:55.729 --> 14:58.096
When i was digging,
i thought i heard gophers,

14:58.098 --> 15:03.201
But now i'm realizing,
that was dolphins.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.771
Parker, you do realize
that you could flood
aunt dena's house!

15:06.773 --> 15:08.239
How are you gonna
fix this?

15:08.241 --> 15:11.542
Don't worry, i've got an idea.
I'll be right back.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.977
Don't drown.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.288
Okay, girls, time for
the first unofficial,
unsanctioned,

15:23.290 --> 15:25.857
Unapproved sleep-over

Errrrrr!

16:37.497 --> 16:39.163
Oh, what's that, conductor?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.333
Next stop is...
Best friend station?

16:43.269 --> 16:44.335
Ahh.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.371
Toot-toot!

16:46.373 --> 16:48.339
Chug-a chug-a chug-a...

16:48.341 --> 16:50.208
Okay, girls...

16:50.210 --> 16:52.243
Wow!

16:53.179 --> 16:54.445
We're just two frogs,

16:54.447 --> 16:57.081
All hopped up on dancing
and fun!

16:58.618 --> 17:01.719
We are going to
catapult that helmet

17:01.721 --> 17:03.554
Back onto
the suit of armor.

17:03.556 --> 17:08.359
Okay, did you two just become
best friends?

17:08.361 --> 17:12.063
We're just having fun
being dressed like frogs

17:12.065 --> 17:14.198
And launching helmets
into the air.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.267
Why do you gotta
make it weird?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.339
1, 2, 3...

17:21.341 --> 17:22.473
Both: Ribbit!

17:23.543 --> 17:24.942
(clang!)

17:31.251 --> 17:32.784
Go, go, go, go, go!

17:38.258 --> 17:40.691
Okay, i'm making some
quick-drying parker paste.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.593
How's it going over there?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.164
Oh, you know,
just holding back

17:46.166 --> 17:50.134
The entire
pacific ocean
with my finger!

17:51.071 --> 17:53.137
Girl, you have no chill.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.140
It'll plug up that hole
in no time.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.247
Uh-oh.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.918
The quick-drying
parker paste dried
a little too quickly.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.287
What should i do?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.922
Ha ha.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.624
Come closer
so that i can kill you
with my free hand.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.861
Relax,
we'll figure this out.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.429
(sighs)

18:18.431 --> 18:20.431
Do you have something
to eat, because i
am starving!

18:20.433 --> 18:23.701
I could go upstairs
and get one of aunt dena's
gross muffins.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.604
I still have one
of those in my pocket.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.378
(sobbing)

18:35.615 --> 18:38.149
It's like i'm chewing
wet cement.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.319
Wait, cement?

18:41.321 --> 18:43.888
Maybe we can plug
the hole with it.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.490
(gasps)

18:46.426 --> 18:48.392
Bleh...

18:51.464 --> 18:54.565
I did not think
these muffins could
get any grosser

18:55.802 --> 18:59.137
Okay. On the count of 3,
you pull and i'll plug.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.304
-Ready?
-Yeah.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.974
1, 2...

19:02.976 --> 19:04.242
3!

19:04.244 --> 19:05.743
Aaah!

19:05.745 --> 19:08.613
(gasping)

19:08.615 --> 19:10.615
What?!
That just worked!

19:10.617 --> 19:12.450
The tunnels are safe again!

19:12.452 --> 19:14.418
Or...

19:14.420 --> 19:17.088
Or i'll shut down
the tunnels tonight.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.362
I got rid of every trace
of joey rooney

19:24.364 --> 19:25.930
On the internet.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.466
Thanks, finch.
If there's anything
i can do...

19:28.468 --> 19:30.835
Please record my new
outgoing message.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.371
Sure thing.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.276
Hello, you've reached
the phone of finch,

19:38.278 --> 19:40.678
Falcon's best friend.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.779
(chuckles)

19:41.781 --> 19:43.781
Please leave a message
after the screech.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.383
(screeches)

19:49.322 --> 19:53.591
Well, someone thinks he's
something, doesn't he?

19:55.161 --> 19:58.296
There's no trace
of joey gilligan rooney
anywhere.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.865
Well, how unfortunate
for you, scooter.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.767
It's skeeter,
and you know it!

20:05.338 --> 20:07.838
Be gone, enemy of falcon.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.075
Unless you have any
stories of space camp
you'd like to share.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.512
I will share nothing
with you!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.814
Except my wrath!

20:19.519 --> 20:22.587
This is not the end,
falcon.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.590
Not... The... End!

20:30.663 --> 20:32.096
So...

20:32.098 --> 20:35.366
A headless knight, yeah?

20:35.368 --> 20:38.603
...Was coming at you,

20:38.605 --> 20:40.671
And then, somehow,

20:40.673 --> 20:44.609
Knocked down
a massive stage light...

20:44.611 --> 20:46.410
Hmm?

20:49.616 --> 20:53.117
...And then shattered
an antique table

20:53.119 --> 20:58.189
That the crew of
<i>♪ sing it louder!! ♪</i>

20:58.191 --> 21:00.157
Had to fly in
from scotland!

21:02.462 --> 21:06.631
Ahem. Yes, that is
exactly what happened.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.533
Because that is
so believable, right?

21:09.535 --> 21:11.435
(gemma chuckles)

21:11.437 --> 21:13.471
Oh, well,
i'm not buying it.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.672
Someone talk.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.375
Hmm...

21:18.645 --> 21:20.544
Okay, i'm really
sorry, gemma.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.779
This whole thing
is my fault.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.447
<i>My</i> fault.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.450
I begged liv to let us
have a slumber party
on the set.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.220
No, it was my idea
to build the catapult.

21:29.222 --> 21:30.621
This is my fault.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.057
But it was my
idea to launch
the helmet.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.493
Ruby, stop, i don't want
you to get in trouble.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.596
I don't want<i> you</i>
to get in trouble.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.464
Awwwwww!

21:42.769 --> 21:44.835
You two are taking
the blame for each other.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.571
You just became best friends!

21:48.508 --> 21:49.573
Whoa!

21:49.575 --> 21:52.810
I think we did.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.212
Yeah, we did!

21:58.151 --> 22:00.117
Gemma, look how cute!

22:00.119 --> 22:03.621
Awwww! Best friends.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.557
I don't care.
My table is still broken!

22:08.261 --> 22:10.861
I will forgive this whole thing
under one condition.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.496
You name it.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.265
You owe me a slumber party.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.700
Yeah, that's right.

22:15.702 --> 22:19.437
I will see you tomorrow night
with sleeping bags in tow.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.706
Oh, uh, fair warning.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.507
I scream in my sleep.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.751
Okay, the tunnels are
officially filled in
and sealed.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.620
A little piece of me
just died, maddie.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.589
I hope you're happy!

22:39.525 --> 22:42.226
Your tunneling days are over.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.628
So, why don't you give me
your headlamp?

22:46.499 --> 22:49.300
Thank you.
And your shovel.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.903
Awesome.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.206
And your backup shovel.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.146
And your
emergency shovel.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.086
Amazing!

23:09.088 --> 23:10.721
All right, is that it?

23:11.758 --> 23:13.758
Yes.

23:14.761 --> 23:15.926
Parker?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.762
Fine.

23:18.931 --> 23:19.997
What...?

23:25.772 --> 23:27.371
How...?
