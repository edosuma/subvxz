00:03.503 --> 00:06.003
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.606
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:10.576
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.257
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:39.004
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.877
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:49.581
Didn't Syd say
she went to Seattle?

00:49.582 --> 00:50.949
Yeah. So?

00:50.950 --> 00:54.477
Why is there a return ticket
from Italy in her pocket?

00:56.356 --> 00:59.814
I came here to pass along
an order from Devlin.

01:00.927 --> 01:04.623
You're going to see a counselor
for trauma evaluation.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.900
Khasinau has converted
$250 million worth of assets

01:08.968 --> 01:10.402
into cash.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.638
We need to know what
he's spending that money on.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.139
You're leaving for Vienna
tonight.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.380
Noah?

01:21.381 --> 01:23.881
Oh, my God.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.750
Do me a favor, Syd.
Tread carefully here.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.550
Until he's debriefed,
I wouldn't get too friendly.

01:29.622 --> 01:32.057
It's ancient history.
It was five years ago.

01:32.058 --> 01:36.358
You were the last person that
I ever wanted to see again.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.063
Ever.

01:38.064 --> 01:42.660
And you were the only person
that I ever wanted to see again.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.872 --> 02:20.205
They found us.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.706
We got to go.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.149
- Skyhook, this is White Rabbit.
- Copy, White Rabbit.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.394
Change of plan.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.796
Tell me you can get us out
30 minutes early.

03:17.797 --> 03:20.297
Affirmative.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.041
Skyhook, we are being pursued!

04:03.042 --> 04:06.170
We're not gonna make it
to the meeting point!

04:06.246 --> 04:09.738
We've locked onto your signal.
Prepare for extraction.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.783
Skyhook, wilco.
Have you in sight.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.052
Turning final approach
from the south.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.554
Syd, we got a hostile, 6:00.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.683
Reverse course 1-8-0 degrees
for recovery in 10...

04:18.757 --> 04:21.257
Noah, hold on.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.062
9...

04:24.063 --> 04:26.563
- Drive for me.
- 8...

04:27.667 --> 04:29.935
7...

04:31.271 --> 04:33.771
6...

04:33.840 --> 04:36.340
5...

04:37.010 --> 04:38.277
4...

04:38.278 --> 04:40.579
I'm pulling the cord.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.914
3...

04:42.915 --> 04:45.415
2...

04:45.985 --> 04:47.519
1.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.020
Hold on!

05:09.842 --> 05:12.504
The CIA has a new lead
on Khasinau.

05:12.578 --> 05:15.547
Apparently, K-Directorate
is looking for revenge, too.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.115
We received intel last night.

05:17.116 --> 05:20.608
They've hired a fairly
prestigious freelance assassin

05:20.687 --> 05:23.187
to find Khasinau
and dismember him.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.624
"The Snowman" is his code name.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.792
The Snowman.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.455
He's been on the CIA's
most-wanted list for 12 years,

05:29.529 --> 05:32.555
presumed dead since '97,
but it seems we're not so lucky.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.333
I'm looking for contacts.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.802
I'm thinking that
maybe we can find Khasinau

05:36.803 --> 05:38.437
by following The Snowman.

05:38.438 --> 05:42.807
I just want to make sure
that you get to Khasinau first.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.375
I know how important
this is to you.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.712
Thank you.

05:54.821 --> 06:00.020
Hey, so, the operation
went all right

06:00.093 --> 06:02.593
in Arkhangelsk with Noah?

06:05.498 --> 06:07.998
Yeah.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.534
Good.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.476
Are you sure
she's coming back tonight?

06:51.477 --> 06:52.911
That's what she said.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.247
She's at the airport
in San Francisco

06:55.248 --> 06:56.815
waiting for a plane.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.383
Are we gonna strategize this?

06:58.384 --> 06:59.718
Strategize how?

06:59.719 --> 07:02.984
I want to be gentle because
we're accusing Sydney of lying.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.580
What if she wants us
to ask her?

07:05.658 --> 07:07.492
She wanted you to find
the ticket

07:07.493 --> 07:09.494
because it's some cry for help.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.995
Well, maybe.

07:17.537 --> 07:20.037
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.543
So, how was San Francisco?

07:24.544 --> 07:26.912
Two days of due diligence.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.147
If I never see another
financial statement,

07:29.148 --> 07:31.648
it'll be fine with me.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.322
I'm just gonna crash,
if you don't mind.

07:37.323 --> 07:38.557
No, of course not.

07:38.558 --> 07:39.825
Okay.

07:39.826 --> 07:40.859
Hi.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.360
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:46.165 --> 07:47.933
I can't believe
you didn't say anything.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.135
That's why I wanted
to strategize.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.503
Syd, you think I'm kidding?
I'm not kidding.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.207
I want you to go away with me.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.143
My point is, what happened
the other night.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.578
It was just too soon.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.309
Russia's got a hell of
a bootleg software industry.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.748
I figured out a way of skimming
money off the Russian mob.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.352
What are you talking about?

08:07.353 --> 08:10.186
I got a lot of money hidden
in offshore accounts.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.990
Syd, I'm getting out.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.959
I'm sick of lying to everyone.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.623
I'm at the point where the idea
of just walking away from people

08:17.697 --> 08:20.131
that are supposed to be
my good friends

08:20.132 --> 08:21.166
is a relief.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.667
And you tell me you've never
felt that way.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.808
I'm just saying that I've got
someone helping me out.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.912
I want you to come with me.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.081
I can't tell you where,
but I can tell you

08:36.082 --> 08:39.414
we won't need locks on the doors
and you will learn how to surf.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.985
You know I can't do that.

08:42.788 --> 08:43.621
Why?

08:43.623 --> 08:45.257
For about a million reasons.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.325
There might be 50 reasons,

08:47.326 --> 08:50.261
and I'd like the opportunity
to refute all of them.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.524
One of the biggest reasons
is my mother.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.100
Khasinau was her superior.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.663
My mother was a spy for the KGB,

08:59.772 --> 09:03.105
and those files that we
recovered may help me find her.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.735
I'm not going anywhere
until I know where she is.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.312
What if I wait?

09:07.313 --> 09:09.813
Will you ever do it?

09:16.022 --> 09:19.219
Sir, as you requested, we
followed up on Agent Noah Hicks.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.307
Is Hicks in the building?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.309
Yes, sir.
He arrived 12 minutes ago.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.904
Tell McCullough
I need to see him.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.214
Don't let Hicks leave.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.985
Dad?

09:46.986 --> 09:49.486
Sydney.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.622
Last time we spoke, you said
you were gonna talk to someone.

09:56.696 --> 09:59.324
I did. Thank you.
I took care of it.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.196
Marshall said he unlocked
Khasinau's computer core.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.330
I wouldn't have allowed
your last operation.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.308
Those computers
are primarily used

10:10.309 --> 10:12.143
for theoretical analyses,
war games.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.279
Of the recovered files,
none bear relevance

10:14.280 --> 10:16.114
to Khasinau's operation,
his plans,

10:16.115 --> 10:17.983
or his cache
of Rambaldi artifacts,

10:17.984 --> 10:20.612
nor do they give any hint
to his whereabouts.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.788
But when I was there,

10:23.789 --> 10:27.020
I saw that there were
some files on Mom.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.994
Yes, I know.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.495
Also recovered on the core

10:30.496 --> 10:33.056
were some equally unhelpful
archival files.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.363
In the case of your mother,
video footage.

10:37.536 --> 10:38.903
Was she in the video?

10:38.904 --> 10:40.271
Yes.

10:40.272 --> 10:43.241
They showed her alive
after the accident?

10:43.342 --> 10:44.576
Yes.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.205
I have no interest
in watching the video.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.180
Analysis is reviewing it.

10:49.181 --> 10:52.014
There's nothing to help
in the hunt for Khasinau,

10:52.084 --> 10:55.212
so the risk
was all for nothing.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.165
Hey, Dixon.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.835
I keep trying to think
of some opening line.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.539
Something to start off with.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.141
To talk to you.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.576
Noah, I'll be straight with you.

11:18.577 --> 11:20.145
I don't trust you.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.913
Which wouldn't be a problem,

11:21.914 --> 11:23.882
except I'm an intelligence
officer,

11:23.883 --> 11:25.784
and if you stick around,

11:25.785 --> 11:29.744
my life is going to be in
your hands, and yours in mine.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.723
And in that scenario,

11:32.792 --> 11:35.693
the only person truly safe
will be you.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.426
Mr. Hicks, would you come
with us, please?

11:40.766 --> 11:43.266
Is there a problem?

11:43.736 --> 11:46.236
Mr. Sloane asked
for you to come with us.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.074
That's never a good thing.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.575
Excuse me.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.253
And on March 16th of this year,

12:02.254 --> 12:05.189
you opened an account
with Bank Africana.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.758
Yes, sir.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.359
Explain.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.860
Well, it was exactly
like the account

12:10.930 --> 12:12.864
we were just talking about.

12:12.865 --> 12:17.268
It was opened up under an alias
as part of an SVR operation.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.532
Mr. McCullough,
I was working undercover,

12:20.639 --> 12:23.139
and I was required to do
a whole bunch of things

12:23.242 --> 12:26.700
which probably seem suspicious
when viewed from the outside.

12:29.315 --> 12:35.083
$47 million was transferred,
then withdrawn within 24 hours.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.989
Yes.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.959
To an untraceable account.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.495
Who was the recipient
of that money?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.996
I don't know.

12:46.732 --> 12:50.133
You don't seem real thrilled
with these responses.

12:52.371 --> 12:56.933
Have you ever conducted business
with the G.L. Bank of Austria?

12:57.042 --> 12:58.977
Yes.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.742
Please provide details.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.841
This man is hiding something.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.512
I'm curious to know what it is.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.087
Would you like me
to have a word with him?

13:15.928 --> 13:18.062
My Russian or American name?

13:18.063 --> 13:20.563
Why not both?

13:20.599 --> 13:23.830
Irina Derevko and Laura Bristow.

13:23.903 --> 13:27.532
When were you recruited
for special duties?

13:27.640 --> 13:31.235
In 1970, I was recruited
to the KGB by you,

13:31.343 --> 13:33.144
Alexander Khasinau.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.842
Describe the objective
of your operation.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.451
Phase one.

13:40.452 --> 13:44.718
I was to pose as an American,
a student of Literature.

13:44.790 --> 13:45.857
Phase two.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.656
I was to make the acquaintance
of a particular officer

13:48.727 --> 13:51.525
in the Central Intelligence
Agency

13:51.597 --> 13:53.498
to insinuate myself
into his life,

13:53.499 --> 13:56.866
to become his confidant,
earn his trust.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.040
Please state the officer
by name.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.670
Officer
Jonathan Donahue Bristow.

14:05.744 --> 14:07.412
Phase three?

14:07.413 --> 14:08.513
Phase three.

14:08.514 --> 14:13.178
I was to begin to acquire
details of the CIA operation

14:13.252 --> 14:15.553
to which Bristow was assigned.

14:15.554 --> 14:16.754
Project Christmas.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.258
You have no reason to believe

14:20.259 --> 14:23.524
that anyone else
was suspicious of you?

14:23.596 --> 14:26.096
<i>Nyet.</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:39.644
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.145
- I need you to feed Donovan.
- Who?

14:42.181 --> 14:43.882
What do you mean, who?
My dog.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.784
Which key is to the front?
Where are you going?

14:46.852 --> 14:48.119
That's the top lock,
that's the bottom lock.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.354
I'm going to Bogot√°.

14:49.355 --> 14:52.256
Give him a can of the dog food
that's on the cupboard floor

14:52.324 --> 14:54.359
and half a can
of the dried stuff.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.329
There's a bag of the dried stuff
next to the canned stuff.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.130
What the hell's in Bogot√°?

14:59.131 --> 15:01.631
Eight years ago,
a guy named Kishell

15:02.902 --> 15:04.702
Collapsed lung, he lost an eye.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.170
It was bad, yeah.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.606
Kishell used to work
with Snowman,

15:08.607 --> 15:10.408
who we know is after Khasinau.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.909
So we get Kishell,
we can get Khasinau.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.612
Exactly.
Half a can only.

15:14.613 --> 15:17.113
I don't want to come back
to a fat dog.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.045
<i>Sydney: There were two men
in Mom's video.</i>

15:21.120 --> 15:22.553
<i>One was Khasinau.</i>

15:22.554 --> 15:25.546
<i>The other one.
I recognized him.</i>

15:34.733 --> 15:36.868
<i>I knew I'd seen his face
before.</i>

15:36.869 --> 15:41.704
<i>It was the FBI agent who died
in the accident with Mom.</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:45.175
<i>Calder's real name is
Igor Sergei Valenko,</i>

15:45.244 --> 15:47.111
<i>the man who was pursuing Mom.</i>

15:47.112 --> 15:49.580
<i>The FBI spy hunter.</i>

15:49.581 --> 15:51.249
Dad, he was KGB.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.048
It wasn't just Mom's death
they faked.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.020
It was Calder's, too.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.751
If we can get to Calder,
maybe we can find Khasinau.

15:58.824 --> 16:01.418
You're assuming Calder
and Khasinau still have ties.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.621
We know that Khasinau liquidated
$200 million in assets.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.825
On that memo were initials.
I.S.V.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.267
Also, six months ago, a man
matching Calder's description

16:11.370 --> 16:13.404
was caught on an SD-4 camera

16:13.405 --> 16:15.905
entering a financial office
in Cape Town,

16:15.908 --> 16:18.309
a known money-laundering
operation.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.143
I'm gonna suggest to Sloane
that we get to Cape Town,

16:21.213 --> 16:23.514
seize their records,
and find Calder.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.507
Noah spent years in
South Africa. He'll be an asset.

16:26.585 --> 16:30.146
SD-6 has run
an additional profile on Noah.

16:30.222 --> 16:33.680
There were anomalies,
including recent bank activity

16:33.759 --> 16:36.557
which suggests he may have
ties to K-Directorate.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.097
Noah's been taken into custody.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.896
What? No.
I know what that's about.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.202
It has nothing to do
with another agency.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.695
Sydney, you have no perspective
on who that man is.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.141
You're as lost now
as I was years ago.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.310
- You don't know him.
- You don't know him.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.811
That's the lesson in all this.

16:54.880 --> 17:01.513
Noah Hicks is not a perfect man,
but he is also not a traitor.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.955
He's a loyal officer
who believes

17:03.956 --> 17:07.255
that he's working for the CIA
and has no idea that SD-6

17:07.326 --> 17:10.522
would kill him if they thought
he was a double agent.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.796
Please.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.866
Dad, talk to Sloane.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.087
I never actually met
The Snowman.

17:38.157 --> 17:41.593
He always contacted me
by telephone.

17:45.697 --> 17:50.191
His name. The Snowman.
It comes from his method.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.863
He prefers an ice pick.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.471
But he uses knives, too.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.441
I helped arrange travel
across difficult borders.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.745
It was my specialty.

18:00.746 --> 18:05.274
One operation,
he was ambushed, attacked.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.080
He fought off and killed
eight men that night.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.054
He thought it was me.
Thought I tipped someone off.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.158
That was when he came after me.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.560
He came to this house.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.061
He attacked me while I slept.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.392
Killing is his job.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.668
He likes his job.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.832
Mr. Kishell, I appreciate
you talking to me.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.073
I know this must be
very difficult.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.409
I know difficult.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.377
Talk is easy.

18:33.378 --> 18:37.109
I know the CIA has spoken
to you before, years ago,

18:37.182 --> 18:39.776
but we recently learned
that an organization

18:39.852 --> 18:41.719
has hired The Snowman
for a job.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.488
Now, I read the transcripts.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.356
Last time, you said
you had no leads.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.258
I was hoping maybe this time,
you might have some.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.956
You have come too far
to go home with nothing.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.858
For years, I was afraid
to do anything,

18:57.970 --> 19:00.470
to seek revenge.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.207
But enough time has passed,
Mr. Vaughn.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.480
I have no more fear.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.019
Yes, I have some leads.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.355
And you'd be willing
to share them?

19:17.356 --> 19:20.348
I will contact them myself.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.925
See if I can find out
where The Snowman is,

19:22.928 --> 19:24.195
what his plans are.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.696
I'd appreciate that.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.627
You must promise me one thing.

19:31.737 --> 19:35.173
That when you find him...

19:35.240 --> 19:37.740
he will suffer, too.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.810
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
you're in pain.

19:46.885 --> 19:49.385
He can get you a stronger m...

19:50.722 --> 19:53.350
Okay. Yeah.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.992
Yeah.

19:54.993 --> 19:58.258
Yeah, just promise me
that you'll call me

19:58.330 --> 20:01.060
after you talk to him, okay?

20:01.133 --> 20:02.266
Good. Okay.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.068
Me too.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.569
Bye.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.309
I need a minute.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.843
Yeah.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.246
This is about Noah Hicks.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.977
There's something
he's not telling us.

20:19.117 --> 20:21.085
I think
he might have been turned.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.351
If you have Hicks killed,
you'd be throwing away an asset.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.190
How so?

20:26.191 --> 20:27.525
You want Khasinau.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.260
You're closer than you think.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.362
Were you aware that Calder, FBI,

20:31.363 --> 20:34.332
was working with the KGB
since 1973?

20:34.399 --> 20:37.425
Sydney's designed an operation
that will lead us to Calder,

20:37.536 --> 20:41.233
at which point we'll be
one step away from Khasinau.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.077
And she wants
Mr. Hicks involved.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.844
This is becoming familiar, Jack.

20:51.049 --> 20:54.815
Your coming to me,
requesting special consideration

20:54.886 --> 20:56.854
for the men in Sydney's life.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.551
Tippin didn't turn out
to be a problem, did he?

21:00.993 --> 21:03.962
Sydney wasn't intimate
with Tippin.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.132
She is with Hicks.

21:09.501 --> 21:15.064
I'm not sure that's my business,
and I know it isn't yours.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.022
<i># Looking out the door #</i>

21:31.023 --> 21:37.451
<i># I see the rain fall upon
the funeral mourners #</i>

21:40.599 --> 21:45.468
<i># Parading in a wake
of sad relations #</i>

21:45.570 --> 21:48.300
<i># As their shoes
fill up with water #</i>

21:54.680 --> 21:58.639
<i># And maybe I'm too young #</i>

21:58.717 --> 22:04.087
<i># To keep good love
from going wrong #</i>

22:04.156 --> 22:06.784
<i># But tonight #</i>

22:06.858 --> 22:10.294
<i># You're on my mind #</i>

22:10.362 --> 22:15.959
<i># So you never know #</i>

22:16.868 --> 22:21.168
<i># Too young to hold on #</i>

22:21.273 --> 22:26.233
<i># And too old
to just break free and run #</i>

22:28.213 --> 22:33.810
<i># Sometimes a man
gets carried away #</i>

22:33.885 --> 22:38.686
<i># When he feels like
he should be having his fun #</i>

22:38.757 --> 22:40.424
<i># And much too blind to see #</i>

22:40.425 --> 22:42.925
<i>Sloane accepted
the mission I proposed.</i>

22:42.994 --> 22:44.995
<i>Noah and I
are going to Cape Town.</i>

22:44.996 --> 22:48.363
<i>Calder's done some business
at a financial office there.</i>

22:48.433 --> 22:51.596
<i>We're gonna break into
that office, get the records,</i>

22:51.703 --> 22:54.467
<i>and hopefully find out
where Calder is.</i>

22:54.573 --> 22:57.073
<i>What's my countermission?</i>

22:58.110 --> 23:01.978
When you realized Calder was
KGB, you should have come to me.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.174
Did you think that
this was just an accident?

23:05.250 --> 23:07.651
I was thinking about
the 36 hours

23:07.652 --> 23:09.920
the FBI kept me in chains.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.223
If I turned over
the Calder information,

23:12.224 --> 23:15.352
you would be required
to forward it to the FBI,

23:15.427 --> 23:17.261
and we both know
what they would do.

23:17.262 --> 23:18.863
- Classify it.
- Omega 17.

23:18.864 --> 23:21.458
We wouldn't be allowed
near that investigation.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.137
I'm supposed to give you this...

23:26.138 --> 23:29.471
tell you to write down
whatever information

23:29.541 --> 23:31.108
you recover from Calder.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.577
Stick it in the chamber,
activate the beacon,

23:33.578 --> 23:35.379
and throw it in a trash can.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.905
But I'm guessing
you're not gonna use it.

23:37.983 --> 23:41.384
Vaughn, I promise you
Khasinau will not walk,

23:41.453 --> 23:43.953
and I won't let SD-6
get to him first.

23:44.022 --> 23:47.048
But I refuse to let the FBI
get in my way again.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.609
Nice shot.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.544
Thanks.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.145
Easy to shoot tranks.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.646
No anxiety
you're killing somebody.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.351
The floor is alarmed

24:14.352 --> 24:16.754
with highly sensitive
motion detectors.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.088
So we stay off the floor.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.491
Of course,
but it also has audio sensors

24:20.492 --> 24:23.086
that can detect any sound
above .05 dB.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.661
In other words...

24:25.997 --> 24:28.557
This right here.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.667
2 dBs.

24:29.668 --> 24:32.432
.05 dB is closer to
the sound of a cockroach

24:32.537 --> 24:34.805
rubbing its legs together.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.807
Okay, so what do we do?

24:36.808 --> 24:39.743
Well, active noise control.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.679
It emits an out-of-phase
audio signal

24:41.680 --> 24:44.581
that cancels out any sound
within a 200-foot radius.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.816
Check it out.

24:47.352 --> 24:49.687
That is really loud, right?

24:49.688 --> 24:51.522
All right, and...

25:15.013 --> 25:17.513
<i># Ready, steady, go #</i>

25:29.494 --> 25:31.994
<i># Ready, steady, go #</i>

26:34.025 --> 26:36.525
<i># Strictly the mother... #</i>

26:40.498 --> 26:43.296
The server case is alarmed.
Don't let anything touch it.

26:43.368 --> 26:46.860
You're gonna want to get a modem
within 3 inches of the server.

26:53.244 --> 26:55.679
Mr. Hicks,
you'll hack into the server

26:55.680 --> 26:58.376
and then download all the data
into your laptop.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.650
Am I boring you?

26:59.651 --> 27:02.151
<i># Ready, go #</i>

27:41.693 --> 27:44.193

28:25.870 --> 28:27.504
You have no reason to believe

28:27.505 --> 28:29.807
that anyone else
became suspicious of you?

28:29.808 --> 28:31.141
<i>Nyet.</i>

28:31.142 --> 28:33.477
Of course
I would have told you.

28:35.814 --> 28:38.314
How did you acquire your intel?

28:39.250 --> 28:43.186
Every night for 10 years,
I went through his briefcase.

28:43.254 --> 28:46.087
I eavesdropped on all
of his private conversations.

28:46.157 --> 28:50.059
I planted listening devices
on his clothing.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.429
He was blinded by his emotions.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.498
He knew nothing.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.266
I can tell you one thing.

28:56.267 --> 29:00.499
Jack Bristow was a fool.

29:24.462 --> 29:25.896
Dr. Barnett.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.231
Mr. Bristow.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.732
Yes. I was...

29:29.801 --> 29:33.259
I was wondering if you might
have some time this afternoon.

29:34.372 --> 29:36.872
I'll make some time.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.017
I didn't pick that play.

29:47.018 --> 29:49.153
The computer picked it.
You didn't.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.687
No, but I don't...

29:50.688 --> 29:52.356
- Reset it!
- Touchdown!

29:52.357 --> 29:53.690
- You cheated.
- Score.

29:53.691 --> 29:54.758
- Dude!
- Score.

29:54.759 --> 29:57.259
Hey, guys.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.795
Hey.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.531
What's going on?

30:04.369 --> 30:06.869
Why are you looking at me
like that?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.506
Did you guys break something?

30:09.507 --> 30:12.007
No.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.511
I found this in the pocket
of your jacket

30:14.512 --> 30:17.012
I borrowed last week.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.317
You said you were in Seattle.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.747
You can tell us if it's
none of our business, but...

30:29.828 --> 30:32.328
We just care about you,
that's all.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.964
- This is serious.
- Yeah.

30:45.210 --> 30:48.577
Okay, I've signed a dozen
non-disclosure agreements,

30:48.646 --> 30:51.342
so this is between us.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.916
Of course.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.620
Six months ago,
my job at the bank changed.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.091
We have a handful of clients,
most of them are international,

31:02.160 --> 31:05.789
who don't want their business to
go through the postal service.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.998
They don't want a paper trail.

31:07.999 --> 31:12.493
So, I fly to them
as the bank's representative.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.867
I'm so sorry I had to keep
this from you guys.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.377
I just had no choice.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.246
Is that legal?

31:22.247 --> 31:24.414
Oh, yeah, it's totally legit.

31:24.415 --> 31:27.942
It's just secret.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.522
Francie thought you were
having an affair.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.028
I just said if you were
having an affair,

31:38.029 --> 31:39.830
I would know about it.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.561
Well, this is all there is.

31:42.634 --> 31:46.161
So I'm gonna go change,

31:46.271 --> 31:49.707
and then I'm gonna kick
your ass in that game.

31:49.774 --> 31:51.775
Oh, bring it on.
Seriously.

31:51.776 --> 31:55.212
I am so bored playing
with Francie, it's rid...

32:02.754 --> 32:07.214
<i># If I scream #</i>

32:07.292 --> 32:13.959
<i># Would you come
and wake me from this dream? #</i>

32:14.032 --> 32:17.627
<i># I know
there's something better #</i>

32:17.702 --> 32:21.468
<i># To be saved #</i>

32:21.572 --> 32:27.408
<i># I need someone
to take my breath away #</i>

32:29.347 --> 32:31.481
Hey, Marshall.

32:31.482 --> 32:32.749
Hey, Miss Bristow.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.378
Anything yet?
Any word on where Calder is?

32:36.888 --> 32:39.388
Mr. Sloane didn't tell you?

32:40.058 --> 32:43.255
There was no data recovered
from Noah's laptop.

32:43.328 --> 32:47.389
That server room must have had
active countermeasures,

32:47.465 --> 32:49.499
so, basically, when you ran out,

32:49.500 --> 32:53.368
your laptop got pulsed
and erased everything.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.971
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.677
You heard about the computers.

33:00.678 --> 33:03.178
Yes.

33:05.183 --> 33:08.414
Syd, if your mom is out there,
you will find her.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.986
It's gonna happen.

33:11.456 --> 33:14.152
I just feel like
I'm at a dead end.

33:14.225 --> 33:15.692
How's the arm?

33:15.693 --> 33:17.661
Well, it feels great.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.663
The lidocaine hasn't worn off.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.895
26 stitches.
New personal record.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.069
- Hello, Sydney.
- Hello.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.570
I was disappointed
when I heard Marshall's news,

33:28.673 --> 33:31.335
but I'm confident we'll
pick up Calder's trail.

33:31.442 --> 33:35.208
Noah, flight to Baku
leaves at 6:00.

33:35.279 --> 33:38.271
In two weeks, you'll enter
into a doctoral program

33:38.349 --> 33:41.113
on Petrol Geoscience
at Khazar University.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.220
Inside this folder,

33:43.221 --> 33:45.721
there's information
on dead-drop procedure.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.257
See I.D. Services
for your passport

33:48.292 --> 33:50.792
and travel visas.

33:50.928 --> 33:53.230
Good luck, Noah.

33:53.231 --> 33:56.064
Noah just got home
from a 5-year assignment.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.001
He's been home for two weeks.

33:58.002 --> 34:01.460
Do you think it's wise
to send him under again so soon?

34:02.140 --> 34:05.109
I volunteered.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.313
Thank you.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.783
You're not
going to Baku, are you?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.518
No.

34:14.518 --> 34:18.455
Tuvalu. It's an island
in the South Pacific.

34:20.591 --> 34:23.286
I talked to my contact.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.860
He says now's my window.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.331
I'm leaving tonight.

34:30.835 --> 34:33.335
And we could go together.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.272
Sometimes all I want to do
is disappear.

34:41.145 --> 34:45.741
Just let all of this go
and just start over again.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.251
But I have my personal
reasons for staying.

34:56.527 --> 35:00.964
Syd, this life is not worth it,
and you know it.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.632
There's too many secrets.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.968
There's too much lying
to everybody.

35:04.969 --> 35:06.169
I know. I know.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.670
Then come with me.

35:13.544 --> 35:16.069
Here's what we're gonna do.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.582
I booked you on a flight
for tomorrow night.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.279
Syd, you come with me
for one week to Tuvalu,

35:21.352 --> 35:23.852
and let me prove to you
that it can work.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.491
Noah...

35:27.492 --> 35:30.484
If it's about your mother,
you and I can find your mother.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.262
We don't need the CIA
for that.

35:32.263 --> 35:34.763
It'll be our last mission.

35:34.765 --> 35:39.065
And after that,
we'll just start completely new.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.670
Can you imagine that?

35:43.307 --> 35:45.575
Be on that plane.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.077
You give me one week.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.578
Just one week.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.428
One week.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.045
Mr. Sloane! Mr. Sloane!

36:22.046 --> 36:24.314
I know I've been impressed
with myself,

36:24.315 --> 36:26.116
but this time I am freaking out.

36:26.117 --> 36:29.985
I used a signal-lost
recovery procedure

36:30.054 --> 36:32.554
to examine
the low-level data sector.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.558
I created a raw image...

36:34.559 --> 36:37.059
Marshall!
What did you do?

36:38.729 --> 36:40.263
I found Valenko.

36:40.264 --> 36:41.932
I mean, Calder.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.800
It's the same guy, right?

36:43.801 --> 36:46.301
Well, I found him.

36:48.339 --> 36:50.273
Marshall has reconstructed

36:50.274 --> 36:53.243
the data that you downloaded
from Cape Town.

36:53.311 --> 36:56.610
The information directed us
to Mackay, Australia,

36:56.681 --> 36:59.275
and Bentley Calder's
private residence.

36:59.350 --> 37:02.751
This one is straightforward.
A daylight snatch operation.

37:02.820 --> 37:06.620
You lead a recovery team,
grab Calder, bring him here.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.858
The plane leaves in two hours.

37:08.859 --> 37:11.359
Dixon, could you
give us a minute?

37:14.498 --> 37:18.958
Sydney, I told you I'd get you
closer to your mother.

37:20.137 --> 37:22.005
I'm always here for you.

37:22.006 --> 37:24.531
You know that.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.244
Thanks.

37:43.694 --> 37:47.653
<i># Will you be
my favorite regret? #</i>

37:50.368 --> 37:54.964
<i># Could I be
your sweetest mistake? #</i>

37:55.072 --> 37:56.072
Hello?

37:56.073 --> 37:57.474
Hey, it's me.

37:57.475 --> 38:00.911
I am 35,000 feet
over the Pacific,

38:01.012 --> 38:03.512
and you just missed
the most beautiful sunset

38:03.581 --> 38:05.382
that I've ever seen in my life.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.883
Hi.

38:08.252 --> 38:09.719
You're coming, right?

38:09.720 --> 38:12.348
Tell me that you are coming
to meet me.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.224
Noah.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.226
Come on.

38:16.227 --> 38:18.957
If things were different...

38:22.033 --> 38:24.533
Any word on Calder?

38:26.103 --> 38:28.371
No.

38:28.372 --> 38:30.240
It was great to see you again.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.971
Syd, whatever
you're about to say,

38:33.044 --> 38:35.544
it's not goodbye.

38:35.613 --> 38:36.613
Okay?

38:36.614 --> 38:37.747
Okay.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.683
All right.
I'll see you.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.184
I'll see you, too.

38:42.219 --> 38:45.154
<i># We'll look until we find #</i>

38:45.222 --> 38:48.783
<i># Something neither
will forget #</i>

38:51.395 --> 38:53.730
Okay, I believe
this isn't goodbye.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.231
Joey's Pizza?

38:59.303 --> 39:01.803
Wrong number.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.375
Devlin knows
you're going to Australia.

39:05.376 --> 39:08.277
You understand he'll be
expecting a full report?

39:09.580 --> 39:10.914
Yeah.

39:10.915 --> 39:13.850
I know how important it is
for you to find your mother,

39:13.918 --> 39:15.552
and I'll help you.

39:15.553 --> 39:18.053
Thanks.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.924
Any word on The Snowman?

39:20.925 --> 39:22.392
That guy I met in Bogot√°.

39:22.393 --> 39:24.893
I'm waiting for him
to call me back.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.597
You want to tell me
what's going on?

39:38.442 --> 39:40.942
Sydney, you can talk to me.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.814
Off the record.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.885
I'm all right.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.933
Wait until I open the main gate.

40:03.934 --> 40:06.069
"B" team will secure
the perimeter

40:06.070 --> 40:08.570
in case Calder
tries to take off.

40:20.117 --> 40:21.451
This is Vaughn.

40:21.452 --> 40:25.115
Mr. Vaughn,
I have spoken to my friends.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.919
I have some information for you.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.960
- Dixon.
- Are you at the junction box?

40:31.996 --> 40:35.329
No, not yet. This is weird.
I don't see any guards.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.091
- Weiss.
- Yeah.

41:02.092 --> 41:04.160
The Snowman's been
spotted in Mackay.

41:04.161 --> 41:07.289
He's going after Calder
to get to Khasinau.

41:07.364 --> 41:09.992
Can you think of a way
to contact Sydney?

41:10.067 --> 41:12.567
- We don't have her on comm?
- No.

41:12.603 --> 41:15.231
Dixon? Dixon?
I just saw three guards.

41:15.339 --> 41:16.339
They're dead.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.840
Dixon?

41:29.386 --> 41:31.886
Oh, no! Calder!

43:21.899 --> 43:24.399
No.

43:25.202 --> 43:27.702
I tried to keep you from this.

43:30.007 --> 43:32.532
I want you to know that.

43:48.559 --> 43:51.059
Sydney!
