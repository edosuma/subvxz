WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.524
- Previously...

00:02.570 --> 00:05.494
- Why can't you talk to me
about what's going on?

00:05.530 --> 00:08.363
- I'd like to ask her
to marry me.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.062
- You wanna torture yourself
for the harm you've done,

00:11.110 --> 00:13.932
and we're here to help you
with that, every minute...

00:13.980 --> 00:15.300
...of every day.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.310
- Liam Maclean,
Connor and Brynn's father.

00:18.350 --> 00:19.340
- No!

00:19.380 --> 00:22.213
- There aren't many of
my kind left in Boston,

00:22.250 --> 00:24.116
but one of them
is a purebred killer.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.345
- Aidan is a good man.

00:25.390 --> 00:28.018
- Take care of him,
or I'll take care of you.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.289
- I killed his daughter.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.480
But it's not like
Aidan is so innocent.

00:31.530 --> 00:34.124
Ever stopped to wonder
how many people he's killed?

00:34.160 --> 00:37.721
- Go out with me.
- Kat's my friend.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.169
- I can control myself.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.602
- Stay away from her, Aidan.
And stay away from Erin too.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.935
She's a kid, Aidan!

00:45.970 --> 00:48.177
- You will serve
the will of the pack.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.706
(Muffled screaming)

00:59.290 --> 01:01.884
- (Man on TV): And now we're
seeing a severe bacon shortage.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.729
With all this missing bacon...

01:03.760 --> 01:05.421
(Yawning)

01:05.760 --> 01:06.795
- Hey!

01:06.830 --> 01:08.252
- Hey.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.459
(TV turning off)

01:11.800 --> 01:13.666
- You know, for 2 people
who live in the same house

01:13.700 --> 01:14.963
and have the same job,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.731
it seems ridiculous that we,
like, never see each other.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.135
I thought you'd
moved out.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.377
- No! Out of the dank
basement wonderland?

01:22.410 --> 01:23.445
No, never.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.074
The pipes alone are like
a gurgling, rusty lullaby.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.077
- Are you going to work?
- Yep.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.487
- Aren't you on nights?
- Yes.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.454
- But it's day.
- Well... T know.

01:32.490 --> 01:34.117
- Are you working doubles?
- Yes.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.049
- That's crazy.
I'll talk to Scheduling.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.580
- Don't do that.
- I'm gonna do it.

01:37.630 --> 01:40.554
A dozen bear claws, a couple
well-considered compliments,

01:40.600 --> 01:41.419
they're putty.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.019
- That's not it.
I'm laying low.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.663
I'm trying not
to be wherever...

01:44.700 --> 01:47.089
(Whispering):
Nora is.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.334
- (Whispering):
Listen, I know...

01:52.380 --> 01:55.577
I know you didn't
hurt Erin on purpose.

01:55.610 --> 01:59.945
Liam got into her head somehow,
made her come after you.

01:59.980 --> 02:02.586
- Come here. Um...

02:08.490 --> 02:11.824
Josh, do you think that
Liam knows about Connor?

02:11.860 --> 02:17.424
- No. The only people who know
are you, me and Nora.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.565
And Nora would never
say anything, ever.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.138
- Why not? She blames me
for Erin's death.

02:24.170 --> 02:27.140
- Yeah, she's angry
and she's grieving.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.672
She'll come around.
She's not gonna sell you out.

02:29.710 --> 02:30.677
- But just the same,

02:30.710 --> 02:33.475
don't you think I ought
to steer clear of her

02:33.520 --> 02:34.919
until after
the full moon?

02:34.950 --> 02:35.974
- No! No, no, no!

02:36.020 --> 02:37.385
- Josh, hey!

02:37.420 --> 02:39.855
- Listen, listen, stop.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.380
We are a household.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.024
I hate tension at home.

02:43.060 --> 02:46.826
I feel like I'm 10, trapped with
my parents' silent fighting.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.625
- Did you just equate me
and Nora with your parents?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.435
- Listen, I'll take
her out tonight to dinner.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.689
I'll ply her with some Pinot.
I'll work my seductive magic.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.630
And tomorrow, you'll be
safe to come home to your...

02:57.670 --> 03:00.640
- Dank basement wonderland.
- Dank basement wonderland.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.273
(Sighs)

03:03.980 --> 03:05.744
(Door closing)

03:17.390 --> 03:18.619
Where's the bread knife?

03:18.660 --> 03:21.095
- Who buys bread
you have to slice?

03:21.130 --> 03:23.269
- That's some crazy
pioneer crap right there.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.429
It's on the shelf next to
the scuzzy chipmunk glass!

03:26.470 --> 03:27.960
- (Beth):
Idiot can't see you.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.206
- Hey!

03:30.240 --> 03:32.629
Hey, have you seen
the serrated knife anywhere?

03:32.680 --> 03:36.401
- Uh, on the shelf,
next to the chipmunk glass?

03:39.980 --> 03:41.141
- (Josh):
That's amazing.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.581
Now, do you know where

03:43.620 --> 03:45.281
my Dr. Zaius
action figure is?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.119
Because I haven't seen him
since, like, 1998.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.321
- I don't know.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.419
Maybe we should ask
the 2 bloody ghosts

03:51.460 --> 03:53.326
in their underwear.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.124
Who the hell are you?

03:55.160 --> 03:56.321
- They're here?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.327
- Oh, we're Aidan's guests.
- For dinner.

03:58.370 --> 04:01.499
Two courses,
one very hungry diner.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.906
- What--what are they saying?

04:03.940 --> 04:05.499
- You know them?

04:06.610 --> 04:09.079
- Aidan...
Aidan killed them

04:09.110 --> 04:11.169
when he was trying
to save Henry.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.178
- AKA: He fed us to
his skinless offspring

04:13.220 --> 04:14.278
like hamsters.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.515
- You left out the part

04:15.550 --> 04:17.916
where he made us make out
with Henry first.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.952
Hence the eternal skivvies.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.954
- I--I can explain.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.368
- It got out of hand.
Aidan panicked.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.801
- That is a super-sanitized
version of what happened.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.979
- How does neck-snapping
get out of hand?

04:43.010 --> 04:45.206
- That's how he...

04:45.250 --> 04:46.342
Listen, I'm sorry.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.745
But I think
you guys should go.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.090
- And I think we
should be unmurdered,

04:50.120 --> 04:51.884
you enabling
codependent assbag.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.354
- Hey!

04:54.620 --> 04:56.520
- Nora, listen,
they're angry.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.187
And they have
every right to be,

04:58.230 --> 05:00.096
but you can't listen
to everything--

05:00.130 --> 05:01.598
- I'm sorry.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.759
(Breathing heavily)

05:07.240 --> 05:08.366
- Are they gone?

05:08.400 --> 05:09.367
(Sally screams)

05:09.410 --> 05:11.435
Or are they
murdering Sally?

05:11.470 --> 05:14.576
- Right, one tip about
Betty and Veronica...

05:14.610 --> 05:17.307
- Hey, since when is wearing
hats inside a thing?

05:17.350 --> 05:18.704
- You have to dress
every moment

05:18.750 --> 05:21.117
like this is the outfit
that you could die in.

05:21.150 --> 05:21.878
- This what you're
willing to die in?

05:21.920 --> 05:23.240
- Stop, quiet.

05:23.290 --> 05:27.579
Listen, just please do not
disperse the underwear bitches

05:27.620 --> 05:29.156
when I am in my room, OK?

05:29.190 --> 05:31.124
That's where they reset.
They died there.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.458
- Aidan killed them
in the house?

05:38.170 --> 05:40.764
- So that makes 3 dead girls.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.735
Basically, our home
is drenched in blood.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.465
- Four.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.234
If you count the header
I took down the stairs.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.442
- Thank you for reminding us

05:51.480 --> 05:54.643
we live in
a funhouse of horrors.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.049
Erin was an accident.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.352
It was an accident.

06:05.390 --> 06:06.528
- Yeah, Erin fell.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.029
She hit her head,
home by herself,

06:09.060 --> 06:11.324
just like we
told the police

06:11.370 --> 06:13.964
and DCS and our supervisors.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.092
And no one's
digging too deep

06:15.140 --> 06:20.374
because there is such a trail
of screwups and neglect

06:20.410 --> 06:21.969
leading to and from Erin

06:22.010 --> 06:25.640
that everyone just wants
to run and cover their asses.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.377
- If you wanna
blame someone,

06:28.420 --> 06:30.343
you gotta blame Liam.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.518
I mean, he's...

06:32.560 --> 06:35.484
He had to have pushed
or threatened Erin

06:35.520 --> 06:37.181
into trying to kill Aidan.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.324
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.069
- Nora, you took Erin in
when no one else would.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.932
- It shouldn't go this easy
when a girl dies.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.934
Somebody should pay.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.901
- (Josh): I know.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.407
I'm so sorry.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.753
- (Beth and Holly):
Oh God!

07:09.790 --> 07:12.225
- Seriously, what are you
gonna do about that?

07:12.260 --> 07:13.955
You're getting worse
by the hour.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.024
You're, like, melting.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.528
- Yeah, and you two look
like human maxi pads.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.628
Glass houses much?

07:17.670 --> 07:20.037
- We're the definition
of "hot mess."

07:20.070 --> 07:22.289
- Could you leave?
I can't deal with you.

07:22.340 --> 07:23.865
Go mess it up somewhere else.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.506
- Drag.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.954
- This can't be happening.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.949
(Birds chirping)

08:02.910 --> 08:04.901
- Josh said you were
gonna leave us alone.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.545
- I knew you were grieving.
I wanted you to have this.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.588
Wolfsbane.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.180
In my family,
when you lose a wolf,

08:15.220 --> 08:17.530
you bury her in
a full field of it.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.880
- But isn't it
bad for wolves?

08:18.930 --> 08:22.457
- Ordinarily, we avoid it
because of its calming effect.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.969
But when a wolf dies,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.369
the idea is it helps
the spirit finally rest.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.562
- I don't know
if she can rest.

08:31.610 --> 08:35.399
Erin had a short
and violent life.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.774
- I think she found
something there at the end.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.972
Erin may not have
been yours by birth,

08:42.020 --> 08:43.647
but you two had a bond.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.011
Packs aren't
just blood family.

08:46.050 --> 08:48.815
You take in a stray,
they become one of your own.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.124
- I'm trying to make sense
of how Erin died...

08:54.160 --> 08:55.924
how she attacked Aidan.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.668
- Is that what
the leech told you?

09:02.870 --> 09:04.804
Nature will
take care of him.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.629
The virus will dust his kind.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.615
- Did you talk to her
about him,

09:12.650 --> 09:14.414
about vampires?

09:14.450 --> 09:18.785
- A 15-year-old alone
with a vampire

09:18.820 --> 09:22.051
gets her head smashed in.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.855
You tell me what happened.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.723
- I shouldn't have
left her alone.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.695
- I should have been there
for Connor and Brynn.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.869
- They were grown.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.335
You couldn't have been
with them all the time.

09:36.370 --> 09:37.565
- Were?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.999
- I meant Connor.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.808
My whole life,

09:44.850 --> 09:48.912
I wanted a father who'd love me
as much as you love Brynn.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.781
I hope you find her.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.731
- Oh, excuse me.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.677
Nora...

10:17.710 --> 10:20.372
(Takes deep breath)

10:22.750 --> 10:23.979
For Josh's sake,

10:24.020 --> 10:26.955
do you think we could
try to get along?

10:26.990 --> 10:30.688
- I wanna believe
the best of you. I do.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.789
Because Josh does.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.329
But Erin is dead.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.160
And there are
2 more girls upstairs

10:42.200 --> 10:44.202
with your initials on them.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.303
- You saw them?

10:47.340 --> 10:48.739
- Yeah.

10:48.780 --> 10:52.148
They were hovering over Josh
while he was grilling paninis.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.614
- OK, what about you?

10:53.650 --> 10:55.516
Purebreds don't let you
join their pack

10:55.550 --> 10:56.688
and then just walk away.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.040
What happened to Brynn?

10:58.090 --> 10:59.546
- Josh told you.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.615
- No, Josh wouldn't do that.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.981
There's only one way
that you left Brynn

11:04.030 --> 11:07.000
or she would have
come after you.

11:07.030 --> 11:09.727
- Let's be clear
on one thing:

11:09.770 --> 11:12.068
Brynn was no innocent.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.434
What I did was to save myself.
It was self-defense.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.234
- That's exactly what...

11:17.270 --> 11:19.307
(Sighs)

11:21.240 --> 11:22.605
So what do you wanna do?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.803
- I will be cordial,
for Josh's sake,

11:25.850 --> 11:29.548
until I understand exactly
what happened to Erin.

11:29.580 --> 11:32.186
- And then someone
IS gonna answer for it.

11:32.220 --> 11:35.451
Until then, you better
stay out of my way.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.924
(Woman laughing)

11:52.210 --> 11:53.280
- Professor Neely!

11:54.310 --> 11:55.300
- Oh! Crap!

11:55.340 --> 11:56.944
- "Oh crap" to you too.

11:56.980 --> 12:00.075
- No, I mean, are we
supposed to meet now?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.919
- No, um, this is
gonna sound sudden,

12:02.950 --> 12:05.612
but I can't go out
with you tonight.

12:05.650 --> 12:06.856
(Chuckles)

12:06.890 --> 12:09.757
- You like to do things
in person, don't you?

12:09.790 --> 12:12.521
- The thing is, it's just
not a good idea, you know,

12:12.560 --> 12:14.494
going out with
your roommate's friend.

12:14.530 --> 12:15.952
It's complicated.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.695
- Oh!

12:17.730 --> 12:19.619
SO you wanna see me never.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.729
I thought you
were rescheduling.

12:21.770 --> 12:22.999
- Well, not never.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.202
I mean, if we run
into each other...

12:25.240 --> 12:26.264
- Yeah, right.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.336
If we run into each other,
we won't avert our eyes.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.847
- Great, so, uh,
I'll see you around.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.009
- You are not used to women
saying no to you, are you?

12:37.050 --> 12:38.211
- What? No.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.685
No, I mean, no,
I am not used to...

12:40.720 --> 12:43.587
I mean, yes,
people say no to me.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.258
- OK. Then no.

12:46.290 --> 12:47.325
- No what?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.897
I didn't ask a yes or no
question, or any question.

12:49.930 --> 12:53.798
- No, you may not break
your date with me.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.004
- Isn't that more like saying
yes, only really forcibly?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.270
- Do you know how hard it is
to find a layperson

13:01.310 --> 13:03.642
who can argue about
the Continental Congress?

13:03.680 --> 13:04.909
- I do, actually.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.145
- You're not one of those

13:06.180 --> 13:08.979
Revolutionary War
reenactors, are you?

13:09.020 --> 13:10.510
- Uh, nay.
- Pity.

13:10.550 --> 13:14.453
I've been known to don a.
tavern-wench outfit on occasion.

13:14.490 --> 13:15.753
- Um...

13:15.790 --> 13:17.326
- It's good clean
American historical fun.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.829
- OK. You're one of those
Renaissance-fair chicks, huh?

13:19.860 --> 13:21.851
- You may never know
what manner of corsets

13:21.900 --> 13:24.267
I have in my closet.

13:35.710 --> 13:39.101
- So now the rot spot
has spread.

13:39.150 --> 13:42.211
Is crap seriously not
falling off your body?

13:42.250 --> 13:44.014
- No, I'm intact.

13:44.050 --> 13:45.313
- I mean, I'd ask Stevie,

13:45.350 --> 13:47.114
but he's out hitching
with strangers.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.379
Hopefully not leaving
bits of himself

13:49.420 --> 13:50.728
in every car he's been in.

13:50.760 --> 13:51.921
- It's just your scalp?

13:51.960 --> 13:54.827
- Yeah, for now.
Am I overreacting?

13:54.860 --> 13:56.089
- It's easy for me to say.

13:56.130 --> 13:57.928
I don't have
your flowing tresses.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.563
- I mean, yeah, OK,

13:59.600 --> 14:03.639
so maybe this is just part
of the reanimation, right?

14:03.670 --> 14:06.560
My scalp sloughing off,

14:06.610 --> 14:08.100
it's like chemo.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.939
And I've always had
super-sensitive skin.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.846
- We went through
a radical process.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.611
The stress of being
brought back from the dead?

14:15.650 --> 14:17.243
Criminally underreported.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.042
- Also, I've been eating
like a half-ton shut-in.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.752
Do you have any chips?
- Knock yourself out.

14:21.790 --> 14:23.326
- Oh, pretzel bites.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.385
(Cat meowing)

14:28.360 --> 14:30.169
You guys get a cat?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.793
- Oh, no,
it's just a stray.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.468
I feel sorry for
the little bugger.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.505
Listen, I kind of have
a full plate today.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.100
- Full plate of what?
You never leave the house.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.973
- I know! But look
how clean it is, huh?

14:43.010 --> 14:45.809
No, you know, I just
wanna paint the bedroom.

14:45.850 --> 14:48.342
I'm putting up a couple
of new bookshelves.

14:48.380 --> 14:51.816
And, actually, I have
online Arabic at 4:00, so...

14:51.850 --> 14:53.079
- Well, don't mind me.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.656
I'll just flake away
somewhere else.

14:54.690 --> 14:57.660
- Maybe, you know, you can
throw some powder up there.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.089
- Oh, thanks
for not caring.

14:59.130 --> 15:01.599
Have fun not rotting.

15:15.910 --> 15:18.641
- I am going to lash myself
to this thing

15:18.680 --> 15:20.819
and then just
refuse to leave.

15:20.850 --> 15:21.817
Is that OK with you?

15:21.850 --> 15:22.373
(Laughs)

15:23.390 --> 15:26.314
- You weren't kidding.
This is...

15:26.350 --> 15:28.159
- -This is like
nirvana in a house.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.227
It's unbelievable.
Look at the dining room.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.820
- Yeah, that, and way
out of our price range.

15:32.860 --> 15:34.919
- Would you just
bask in it? All right?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.394
Just enjoy it.

15:36.430 --> 15:37.329
- I'm trying to bask.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.327
- You're not trying hard enough.
- I am.

15:39.370 --> 15:42.032
I keep feeling like we're
here to be interviewed

15:42.070 --> 15:44.164
for some butler/housemaid
situation.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.769
- Hi.

15:45.810 --> 15:47.904
- Oh! Wow!

15:47.940 --> 15:50.602
Day drinking in
a stranger's house.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.004
- It could be your house.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.439
You two take it in
without me hovering.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.209
- Thanks, Martha.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.311
- So why is Martha

16:01.360 --> 16:04.386
acting like we're
gonna make an offer?

16:05.360 --> 16:08.955
- Well, because
I may have

16:09.000 --> 16:10.820
lied through my teeth...

16:10.870 --> 16:12.190
(Laughing)

16:12.230 --> 16:15.291
...to get us
a private viewing.

16:15.340 --> 16:19.504
- Why? So that we could
feel bad about ourselves?

16:19.540 --> 16:20.530
- Mm-mmm.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.878
So we could see what
our future looks like.

16:22.910 --> 16:25.277
- Hey, whoa! No, no!
I didn't even get a sip!

16:26.880 --> 16:30.009
- I know we can't
swing this place.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.383
But someday,

16:33.420 --> 16:37.584
we will live in a house
just as beautiful.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.382
I promise.

16:42.730 --> 16:43.868
Do you love me?

16:43.900 --> 16:46.767
- Of course I do. Always.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.931
- I've been looking,
waiting for this, like,

16:49.970 --> 16:51.460
perfect, elusive moment,

16:51.510 --> 16:55.140
but it always just seems
like there's an avalanche

16:55.180 --> 16:58.150
<i>that we have to
dig ourselves out of.</i>

16:59.250 --> 17:02.276
And I know that
you're grieving.

17:03.850 --> 17:06.444
And I know that
it's a turn night.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.554
But we're still here...

17:10.589 --> 17:12.387
together.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.723
And that's not
gonna change.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.632
- Oh my God!

17:20.670 --> 17:22.490
- Sit down.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.201
- Josh...

17:26.040 --> 17:28.372
- I love you so much.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.675
I love you more than
I ever thought possible.

17:35.150 --> 17:40.316
I love you more and more
and more every single day.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.581
And I'm gonna take care
of you until we're both...

17:44.630 --> 17:46.780
in diapers.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.628
(Laughs)

17:48.660 --> 17:50.059
At which point,

17:50.100 --> 17:53.593
I will have arranged for
some excellent home care.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.601
And until then,
it's gonna be awesome.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.174
Roses.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.145
- Oh my God!

18:11.520 --> 18:13.511
- Will you marry me?

18:15.460 --> 18:18.384
- You're ready for
a lifetime of it?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.250
With what our lives are like,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.053
never knowing what's coming
at us around the corner?

18:23.100 --> 18:25.068
- That's why I wanna
do it right now.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.295
I don't wanna wait.

18:26.330 --> 18:28.298
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.468
What are we waiting for?

18:32.710 --> 18:33.871
- Nothing.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.002
(Laughing)

18:35.040 --> 18:36.405
- Nothing, right?

18:36.440 --> 18:37.510
- Yes.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.700
- Yes?
- Yes.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.218
- Really?
- Yes)!I'

18:43.450 --> 18:45.339
I love you.
- I love you.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.010
OK...

18:50.060 --> 18:51.983
OK...

18:52.030 --> 18:53.429
You wanna jump me
right now.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.599
- If this wasn't
your best shirt...

18:55.630 --> 18:56.756
- Uh-huh.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.564
<i>- ...I'd tear it
off your body.</i>

18:58.600 --> 18:59.761
- Uh-huh!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.689
You should
maybe try that.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.710
- Let's lock Martha out.
- Yeah, Martha.

19:04.740 --> 19:08.335
And you are going to die
when you see the master bath.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.805
I almost spilled future
generations just looking at it!

19:21.320 --> 19:23.425
- And what's all
that business?

19:23.460 --> 19:24.825
- This is embalmer's wax.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.795
It helps to, like,
smooth out the jaggedy bits

19:27.830 --> 19:29.150
and it preps the surface.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.497
- That's handy.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.965
It's like spackle and primer.
Two-in-one job.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.263
- You ever wonder

19:34.300 --> 19:36.564
what other couples do
for fun and conversation?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.809
- No. Those couples run out of
things to talk about at dinner.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.604
- Oh.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.074
- That's tight.

19:43.110 --> 19:44.908
Does it last?

19:45.950 --> 19:47.714
- You mean, like, forever?

19:47.750 --> 19:50.287
- Yeah. Does it hold up
to a lot of wear and tear?

19:50.320 --> 19:51.515
Is it waterproof?

19:51.550 --> 19:54.349
- I don't think he'll be
joining the Dead Olympics,

19:54.390 --> 19:56.154
if that's what you mean.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.454
Why has it gotta
be waterproof?

20:01.330 --> 20:04.197
- Just, like, you know,
mourners' tears,

20:04.230 --> 20:06.062
bathing the skin...

20:06.100 --> 20:08.194
Well...

20:08.240 --> 20:10.129
- Well, T haven't
had any complaints.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.660
It seems to hold up
pretty well

20:11.710 --> 20:14.509
at all the hot
and humid funerals.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.974
- Hmm!

20:16.010 --> 20:17.409
- Hey, no fingerprints.
Come on.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.875
- How long does
that all take to set?

20:22.680 --> 20:23.715
(Chuckles)

20:25.590 --> 20:27.911
- Huh! So you were
listening to my lecture

20:27.960 --> 20:29.314
and not just
lurking outside.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.419
- Well, I wasn't
gonna say anything,

20:31.460 --> 20:34.589
but I didn't see
how the brothel...

20:34.630 --> 20:35.893
(Laughs)

20:35.930 --> 20:37.568
- Uh, right, well,

20:37.600 --> 20:40.297
when more than 2 of
my students are asleep,

20:40.340 --> 20:43.230
I start talking about
strumpets and bawdyhouses

20:43.270 --> 20:45.068
just to see if
they're listening.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.930
- How did you
get into this era?

20:46.970 --> 20:49.007
- Why? 'Cause it's
SO unsexy?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.077
(Laughs)

20:51.110 --> 20:52.874
Because, um,

20:52.910 --> 20:56.517
one of my ancestors was
a Revolutionary War hero.

20:56.550 --> 20:59.110
- Oh! OK.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.357
- Why so skeptical?

21:01.390 --> 21:05.020
- It was a less heroic time
than people think.

21:05.060 --> 21:08.519
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I offend you?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.494
- No. No!
It's nothing personal.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.259
It's just that
NO one ever says:

21:12.300 --> 21:14.860
"My ancestor was a war criminal
or a pig farmer."

21:14.900 --> 21:16.493
- Aidan!

21:16.540 --> 21:19.339
Finally, face to face.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.930
- Uh, sorry, do I know you?

21:21.980 --> 21:24.301
- You knew my son, Connor.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.045
I'm Liam Maclean.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.011
And you are?

21:29.050 --> 21:31.348
- Kat.
- Kat.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.779
- Can I catch up with you
in a couple minutes?

21:33.820 --> 21:35.015
Do you mind?

21:35.060 --> 21:36.312
- I can wait.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.351
- She likes you.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.628
- Uh, Liam, could I just
have a couple of minutes?

21:42.660 --> 21:43.923
- Sure.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.438
- Hey, I'm just gonna
take care of some business.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.268
- Right now?
Mid-corridor?

21:50.300 --> 21:51.699
- I know.
It's super abrupt.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.435
I tend to do this
to you a lot.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.936
- Don't go. I'm serious.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.972
(Raises voice): We're late
meeting my mom, remember?

21:59.950 --> 22:03.784
Come on, I can throw
a girly fit if you want.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.686
- I'll call you.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.452
Trust me.
- OK.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.967
- (Aidan):
What do you want?

22:19.200 --> 22:21.430
- Under different
circumstances,

22:21.470 --> 22:23.700
you'd love where
I'm taking you.

22:23.740 --> 22:27.404
It's a singular place,
dear to my heart.

22:34.220 --> 22:39.340
- (Record player):
** Why question our feelings?

22:39.390 --> 22:41.813
* Deep as they are *

22:41.860 --> 22:46.024
- Thrown to the wolves
by a fellow leech.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.256
It's staggering!

22:48.300 --> 22:51.167
We protect our own...

22:51.200 --> 22:53.669
avenge our own.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.568
You murdered my son.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.707
- Murdered your son?
He was hunting me for sport!

23:02.280 --> 23:03.475
(Groans)

23:03.510 --> 23:05.945
- Blackthorn burns worse
than most, doesn't it?

23:07.180 --> 23:08.716
(Groaning)

23:10.520 --> 23:12.488
Tell me what
happened to Brynn!

23:12.520 --> 23:14.386
- I don't know!

23:15.920 --> 23:18.059
She was too fast.
I couldn't catch her.

23:18.090 --> 23:19.524
(Panting)

23:19.560 --> 23:21.597
- Are you saying that
my daughter turned and ran,

23:21.630 --> 23:25.191
leaving her brother's
dead body with you?

23:25.230 --> 23:26.925
- Think about it.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.996
How could she face you
without her brother?

23:38.980 --> 23:41.517
- She would have found
her way home eventually.

23:41.550 --> 23:44.247
And Brynn could
never have hidden

23:44.290 --> 23:46.440
so that I couldn't find her.

23:55.700 --> 24:00.570
I'm a tracker by blood.
I'll always find my own.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.766
Are you gonna tell me?

24:09.210 --> 24:12.339
I could let you
die like a man.

24:12.380 --> 24:15.020
We could face off
when I turn...

24:15.980 --> 24:20.190
purebred against leech,
a fight to the finish.

24:20.220 --> 24:23.087
I might even give you
a silver blade.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.983
Tell me what happened!

24:28.330 --> 24:29.923
The truth!

24:32.700 --> 24:35.635
(Gasping, coughing)

24:52.750 --> 24:54.809
- Forget to do
the shopping?

24:54.860 --> 24:56.954
- Hey, babe.

24:56.990 --> 24:58.424
I was just...

24:58.460 --> 25:00.599
- Going drugstore
cowboy at work?

25:00.630 --> 25:03.895
- No. I was just borrowing
a couple of essentials.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.697
- Do you know how many porters
that I've had to fire

25:08.740 --> 25:10.230
for fencing formaldehyde?

25:10.270 --> 25:12.204
- I don't want
your formaldehyde.

25:13.810 --> 25:17.132
- You're not huffing
embalming fluid, are you?

25:17.180 --> 25:18.944
- No. I just...

25:18.980 --> 25:21.870
I was just trying to work
on my reconstruction skills.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.740
- It's just a solvent, OK?
It's not gonna get you high.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.509
- No, that's not
what I'm doing.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.518
- What are you
doing then? Huh?

25:28.560 --> 25:31.120
What is this horror story
that you won't tell me?

25:37.970 --> 25:40.189
- I don't even expect you
to believe me.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.834
- Well, try me.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.538
- I was a ghost...

25:51.180 --> 25:52.773
up until a few months ago.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.370
And then my body
got reanimated

25:55.420 --> 25:57.343
by this gifted yet lying

25:57.380 --> 25:59.883
practitioner of
death reversal,

25:59.920 --> 26:01.251
and here I am.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.259
- Um...

26:06.290 --> 26:10.227
I--I have
a cousin who's...

26:10.260 --> 26:12.627
He's manic-depressive.

26:13.470 --> 26:15.029
- Not nearly the same thing.

26:15.070 --> 26:17.289
- OK. Well, what I'm
trying to say is

26:17.340 --> 26:18.865
I--I understand.

26:20.540 --> 26:21.871
Don't...

26:21.910 --> 26:26.609
Don't take this the wrong way,
but are you on meds?

26:26.650 --> 26:28.345
Or should you be on meds?

26:28.380 --> 26:29.848
- I'm not insane.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.588
I wish it were
that believable, Max.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.658
- OK, um...

26:40.730 --> 26:43.927
I'm--I'm gonna believe
what you tell me.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.590
I trust you, you know.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.132
I mean, this is
how it works, right?

26:58.080 --> 27:03.280
- Before I was a ghost,
I was human...

27:03.320 --> 27:04.719
alive.

27:06.350 --> 27:08.352
And then I died.

27:08.390 --> 27:10.779
And now I'm...

27:12.030 --> 27:15.955
I'm breaking down,
not mentally.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.898
I'm decomposing.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.245
I think I'm dying...

27:33.280 --> 27:34.475
again.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.942
- Oh...

27:38.250 --> 27:41.015
OK, so--so, like, um...

27:42.290 --> 27:45.988
So what you're saying is
that you're like...

27:47.730 --> 27:53.396
a non-flesh-eating,
super-articulate...

27:53.430 --> 27:54.795
zombie?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.330
- Max, I'm still me.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.738
- No, no. Sally, if what
you're saying is true,

27:59.770 --> 28:02.273
then I don't know
what you are.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.455
(Cat meowing)

28:14.490 --> 28:17.824
- Oh, hey, precious!

28:17.860 --> 28:20.249
You're a sweet thing,
aren't you?

28:20.290 --> 28:22.099
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

28:23.030 --> 28:26.261
I know.
Oh, you're starving.

28:26.300 --> 28:27.961
Yeah.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.332
(Cat yowling)

28:40.280 --> 28:41.577
- Hey, Kat!

28:41.620 --> 28:43.884
- Hey, did Aidan
come home yet?

28:43.920 --> 28:46.184
He's not answering his cell.
- No.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.609
Uh, no, but I can let him
know that you called.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.786
- OK, um...

28:49.820 --> 28:52.551
Look, this might
sound intrusive,

28:52.590 --> 28:55.298
but is he in some
kind of trouble?

28:55.330 --> 28:56.491
- Trouble?

28:56.530 --> 29:00.660
- Yeah, like gambling debts
or drug-related activities.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.668
I sound like my mom now.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.909
Um, we were walking
and these men...

29:05.940 --> 29:08.034
I have never said this before.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.778
Two of them looked like they
break kneecaps for a living,

29:11.810 --> 29:13.915
and Aidan went off with them.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.748
- Did they say who they were?

29:15.780 --> 29:19.444
- The tall one was
someone's father. Connor?

29:19.490 --> 29:21.458
That could have been the son.

29:21.490 --> 29:23.015
- Kat, I gotta go.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.221
Nora, do you know
where Liam turns?

30:03.030 --> 30:05.124
(Crickets chirping)

30:27.390 --> 30:28.812
- Ah!

30:28.860 --> 30:30.919
(Groaning)

30:33.160 --> 30:35.527
<i>- (Record player):
** TX really has to be</i>

30:35.560 --> 30:39.064
* What he thinks
is called free **

30:41.140 --> 30:43.290
- I remember my father
telling me

30:43.340 --> 30:46.901
that there are certain moments
in life so precious

30:46.940 --> 30:50.433
you don't wanna let them
slip away too quickly.

30:52.350 --> 30:57.277
Surely avenging your son's
death is one of those.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.140
<i>Tell me!</i>

31:01.320 --> 31:02.856
- Ah!

31:02.890 --> 31:05.120
(Moaning)

31:07.160 --> 31:09.629
I don't know what happened
to your daughter.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.968
- I think you do.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.989
But take it with you
to the dust.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.599
I'll find her on my own.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.199
(Sledgehammer hitting floor)

31:39.330 --> 31:42.356
(* Woman singing
on record player *)

31:47.940 --> 31:49.567
- What is that?

31:49.600 --> 31:52.137
- Hmm? This?

31:53.140 --> 31:54.369
The end.

31:56.510 --> 31:58.501
Some whore's blood...

31:59.610 --> 32:01.419
infected with the virus.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.590
Don't you think
you would've heard

32:15.630 --> 32:17.997
if I had killed 2 purebreds?

32:18.030 --> 32:19.589
- It's all right.

32:27.370 --> 32:32.069
I'll be here when the sores
crack open on your skin

32:32.110 --> 32:35.114
and the fever burns
your bones to ash.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.278
- Wait, wait.
Please wait.

32:38.550 --> 32:40.143
I'll tell you the truth.

32:41.420 --> 32:44.629
I'll tell you what happened
to your daughter.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.958
I killed your daughter.

32:52.030 --> 32:55.432
And she screamed
like a bitch,

32:55.470 --> 32:57.768
just like your son!

32:57.800 --> 32:59.302
- No!

33:07.850 --> 33:09.716
- No, no, get out of here.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.115
- (Josh):
Aidan, stop.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.384
- Leave me.
You have to leave, Josh.

33:14.420 --> 33:15.512
No, Josh.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.924
No, Josh. Come on!

33:18.960 --> 33:20.928
You have to leave, man.
Get out!

33:20.960 --> 33:22.655
Josh!

33:22.700 --> 33:24.190
(Snarling)

33:24.230 --> 33:26.369
He's getting up, Josh!
You gotta leave.

33:29.970 --> 33:32.166
(Groaning)

33:34.910 --> 33:36.469
- Get your arm.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.669
- You're wasting
your bullets, man!

33:47.250 --> 33:50.117
- Go! Go!
Go, go, go!

33:50.160 --> 33:52.356
Go, go, go! Oh!

33:55.400 --> 33:56.492
Ah!

33:56.530 --> 33:58.168
(Groaning)

34:01.600 --> 34:02.692
(Roaring)

34:02.740 --> 34:04.037
Oh!

34:08.780 --> 34:11.476
(Pounding on door)

34:30.500 --> 34:33.868
- I'm sorry that I freaked out
and I treated you like a leper.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.629
- Awful beginning!

34:35.670 --> 34:39.504
Please do not mention me and
leprosy in the same sentence.

34:39.540 --> 34:42.407
- OK, I apologize
for my apology, OK?

34:42.440 --> 34:45.409
We've established that I have
zero experience with women.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.543
And you'd think my experience
with dead people

34:47.580 --> 34:51.585
would make a difference here,
but apparently it doesn't.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.485
You stumped me.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.087
- Look, uh...

34:57.890 --> 35:00.029
I know this is
way too high

35:00.060 --> 35:02.859
on the freak-o-meter
to cope with.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.527
I get it.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.369
- I'm not saying that
I can't deal with this. OK?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.994
I probably can deal
with this, most likely.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.235
- That sure, huh?

35:11.270 --> 35:13.159
- You're still you.

35:14.240 --> 35:18.370
You're the gorgeous,
pushy girl that I fell for.

35:21.150 --> 35:23.642
And I, conveniently,
do this for a living, so...

35:27.150 --> 35:29.812
- This is about to get
even weirder, isn't it?

35:40.270 --> 35:43.194
Good Lord, you could make a
person with all that stuff.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.369
You really think
I need this much gear?

35:46.410 --> 35:50.074
- It's just like a, you know,
carpenter with his toolkit.

35:50.110 --> 35:51.976
If I show up with
a hammer and a nail,

35:52.010 --> 35:54.172
I'm gonna end up needing
that one small screw

35:54.220 --> 35:56.177
that's all the way
back in my Kit.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.540
- Metaphorical nails, right?

35:57.580 --> 36:00.049
I'm not walking around
with bolts in my neck.

36:00.090 --> 36:02.149
- Let me see it.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.534
- Even if you can fix me,

36:14.570 --> 36:17.289
I don't know what my
long-term prognosis is.

36:18.570 --> 36:22.336
- Hey, we're gonna take
this step by step, OK?

36:23.740 --> 36:27.199
Or stitch by stitch.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.316
Come on, have a seat.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.660
(Chuckling)

36:54.580 --> 36:56.139
Once again,
not the couple

36:56.180 --> 36:58.706
that's gonna run out
of things to talk about.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.343
(Chuckles)

37:01.920 --> 37:04.048
- Is that OK?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.889
- Yeah.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.630
- I'm eating cats.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.274
I have a Ph.D.
and I'm eating cats.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.711
I should put that on my rsum.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.740
- Why did you...

38:07.180 --> 38:09.672
Why did you tell Liam
you killed Brynn?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.558
- I was already dead.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.952
Liam wasn't
gonna let me go.

38:19.990 --> 38:21.651
I killed his son.

38:22.630 --> 38:25.998
But at least I could
make it worth something...

38:27.200 --> 38:29.134
and save Nora for you.

38:29.170 --> 38:31.764
- You knew Nora
killed Brynn?

38:34.710 --> 38:39.841
- Maybe I was trying to
make up for Erin too,

38:39.880 --> 38:41.848
and those 2 girls.

38:43.350 --> 38:44.988
(Sighs)

38:46.120 --> 38:50.079
There are so many people
that I need to make up for.

38:53.660 --> 38:56.550
- If I had gotten there
5 minutes earlier, 2 minutes...

38:56.600 --> 38:57.692
- Hey.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.432
You came.

39:07.070 --> 39:09.334
(Coughing)

39:12.610 --> 39:14.442
- Let's get you inside.
- Yeah.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.039
- Let's get you inside.

39:19.850 --> 39:22.160
- Oh my God! What can I do?
What can I do?

39:22.190 --> 39:25.080
- I'll call 911!
= (All): No!

39:25.130 --> 39:26.655
- Get him out of here.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.757
- Were they in a shootout?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.529
- Max, you gotta go.
You have to leave.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.630
- You're kidding me.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.798
- Please. I'll try
to explain tomorrow.

39:33.830 --> 39:34.991
- No more secrets!

39:35.040 --> 39:37.691
You're not just gonna kiss me
and shove me out the door.

39:37.740 --> 39:40.402
What's going on with you three?
- I can't... I can't...

39:40.440 --> 39:43.102
If it were my secret
to tell you, I would.

39:43.140 --> 39:44.744
I would.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.043
I'm sorry.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.775
- No, no.
- I...

39:50.150 --> 39:51.879
(Door closing)

39:51.920 --> 39:52.887
- You need stitches.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.560
- I'm not leaving the house.
Sew me up here.

39:57.590 --> 40:00.150
- Why do you guys look like
you've been bombed?

40:02.900 --> 40:05.267
- I got scratched.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.859
- What?

40:09.040 --> 40:11.907
- On the next full moon,
I'm gonna be a wolf.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.540
- OK.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.343
OK, well,
we'll deal with it.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.757
We have before.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.935
- It moves that fast?

40:46.970 --> 40:48.165
- What is that?

40:48.210 --> 40:50.474
- It's the virus.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.778
- You can stop it, right?

40:57.450 --> 40:59.612
- Nothing can stop it.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.669
- We'll find a way...

41:15.070 --> 41:17.232
for all of us.

41:17.270 --> 41:19.329
** And when we slip

41:19.370 --> 41:23.432
* We get crazy in our mind

41:23.480 --> 41:27.405
* No more sense of time

41:27.450 --> 41:31.580
* Like walking on ice

41:33.190 --> 41:35.215
* Love

41:35.260 --> 41:39.185
* On a slippery summer night

41:39.230 --> 41:41.187
* Walking on ice

41:41.230 --> 41:45.064
* Love, love

41:45.100 --> 41:47.228
* Love

41:48.270 --> 41:50.932
* And this is it

41:50.970 --> 41:55.874
* I could never
leave you behind *

41:55.910 --> 41:59.540
* They made sense of time

41:59.580 --> 42:02.948
* Like walking on ice

42:04.650 --> 42:06.516
* Love

42:06.550 --> 42:10.612
* On a slippery summer night

42:10.660 --> 42:13.083
* Walking on ice...

42:13.130 --> 42:15.121
Not possible.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.966
Not if you were the last meal
on a dying planet.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.508
Oh...

42:32.550 --> 42:34.541
Lovely.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.247
* And the breeze

42:39.720 --> 42:42.018
* Can still your mind

42:42.060 --> 42:46.179
* Leave you soft,
leave you blind *

42:46.230 --> 42:49.052
* Leave you seeking
more advice *

42:49.100 --> 42:51.922
* Like you're walking on ice

42:51.970 --> 42:57.966
* Love on a slippery
summer night **
