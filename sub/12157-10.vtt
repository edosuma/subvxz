WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:03.337
HEY, BOYD, COME ON.

00:03.371 --> 00:04.338
TURN OFF THE TV,
GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.339
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.974
I DON'T WANNA GO.
WHY NOT?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.410
CHELSEA KING
KEEPS TRYING TO KISS ME.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.345
IT'S GROSS.
(turns off TV)

00:11.379 --> 00:14.082
I IMAGINE IT IS GROSS NOW,

00:14.115 --> 00:15.749
BUT IN A COUPLE YEARS,
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.018
AND AFTER THAT,
IT JUST GETS EXPENSIVE,

00:18.052 --> 00:20.054
AND THEN IT JUST STOPS
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:21.355 --> 00:26.227
YOU SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
I'M STILL GETTIN' PLENTY. MM.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.695
HEY, THANKS AGAIN
FOR LETTING ME

00:27.728 --> 00:29.563
USE YOUR HISTORY PAPER
ON THE CIVIL WAR.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.832
GUARANTEED "A." JUST DON'T
FORGET TO CHANGE THE NAME.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.035
OH, YEAH.
WAY AHEAD OF YOU. SEE?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.437
HMM...

00:36.470 --> 00:40.108
"HOW GEORGE WASHINGTON
FREED THE SLAVES."

00:42.310 --> 00:45.746
YOU MIGHT HAVE CHANGED
THE WRONG NAME.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.116
GIRLS, CLEAR YOUR PLATES,
PLEASE.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.184
HONEY, CALL 'EM BACK.
GET 'EM TO CLEAR THE PLATES.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.220
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY? IT'S JUST
AS EASY IF I DO IT MYSELF.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.687
UNLESS SOMEONE
WANTS TO HELP ME?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.856
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. WHY DON'T
YOU GET MRS. HALL COME IN

00:55.889 --> 00:57.225
AN EXTRA COUPLE DAYS?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.059
MRS. HALL?
(silverware clatters)

00:59.093 --> 01:00.261
OUR HOUSEKEEPER.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.130
WHERE HAS SHE BEEN LATELY?

01:02.163 --> 01:04.465
DEAD.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.134
SINCE WHEN?

01:06.167 --> 01:09.303
SINCE RIGHT
BEFORE HER FUNERAL...

01:09.337 --> 01:11.739
THAT WE WENT TO?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.374
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

01:13.407 --> 01:16.110
WE SHOULD GET SOMEBODY IN HERE
A FEW DAYS A WEEK TO HELP OUT.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.078
BOY, A FEW DAYS?
WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING GIRLS

01:18.112 --> 01:20.047
IF THEY WON'T
COOK AND CLEAN FOR US?

01:20.080 --> 01:23.417
I'M CONFUSED. SO YOU THINK
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE GIRLS,

01:23.451 --> 01:25.753
THEY SHOULD COOK
AND CLEAN FOR US?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.455
GIRLS ARE JUST BETTER AT IT.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.590
GUYS ARE TERRIBLE
AT COOKING AND CLEANING.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.459
HAVE YOU EVER SPENT TIME
AT A FRAT HOUSE?

01:31.492 --> 01:33.161
OH, YEAH.
THEN YOU'D KNOW HOW BAD--

01:33.194 --> 01:35.663
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OH, YEAH"?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:35.696 --> 01:38.166
HI, GUYS.
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY THINKING

01:38.199 --> 01:39.900
ABOUT GETTING ANOTHER
HOUSEKEEPER?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.769
'CAUSE, I MEAN, HOW WOULD YOU
FEEL ABOUT PAYING ME TO DO IT?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.772
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WITH A LITTLE EXPERIENCE.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.974
BUT I WANT TO SAVE UP
SOME MORE MONEY.

01:47.007 --> 01:50.244
I NEED TO BUY
A SLIGHTLY LESS-USED USED CAR.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.012
BUT YOUR CAR
ISN'T THAT OLD.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.314
MOM, THERE'S
A SPICE GIRLS CASSETTE

01:53.347 --> 01:55.015
JAMMED
IN THE TAPE PLAYER, OKAY?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.251
I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE A MOOCH HERE.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.419
I WANT TO WORK FOR IT.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.588
WE'RE NOT GONNA PAY YOU
TO CLEAN THE HOUSE YOU LIVE IN.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.122
ALL RIGHT. THEN I GUESS
I'LL HAVE TO WAIT ON THAT CAR.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.257
WHAT ABOUT ANOTHER VEHICLE?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.092
IT'S GOT 8 WHEELS AND SEATS 50?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.927
I PAY FOR IT
WITH MY TAX DOLLARS,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.129
AS WELL AS EVERYBODY'S
HEALTH CARE THAT RIDES IN IT?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.431
RIDE THE BUS?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.600
YEAH, IF I WANNA GET GROPED,
I'D WORK AT A DINER.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.304
OH, WAIT. I ALREADY DO.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.273
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE BERTMANS MOVED AWAY,

02:19.307 --> 02:21.175
AND THEIR HOUSEKEEPER'S
AVAILABLE.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.311
SHE'S FROM GUATEMALA,
SHE HAS A GREEN CARD,

02:23.344 --> 02:25.679
AND THEY LOVED HER.
I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT--

02:25.713 --> 02:28.516
THE BERTMANS MOVING AWAY.

02:28.549 --> 02:32.220
HE HAD A MAILBOX THAT LOOKED
LIKE HIS HOUSE. WHAT A PUTZ.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.955
WE WOULDN'T NEED
A NEW HOUSEKEEPER,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.224
IF JUST THESE GIRLS
WOULD STEP IT UP

02:36.257 --> 02:37.325
A LITTLE BIT AROUND HERE.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.326
SEE YOU GUYS.
LATE FOR SCHOOL.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.360
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.528
THAT DOESN'T GO THERE.
ALL RIGHT. SORRY.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.529
NOT THERE. NOT THERE.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.131
SORRY. HERE.
NO, NO, NO. NOT THERE.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.833
NO. STOP.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.136
LOOK. GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.971
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
THERE YOU GO.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.307
EMPTY IT OUT. THERE WE GO.
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.042
YOUR MOM LIKES TO START
FROM THE BACK WITH THE GLASSES.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.644
SEE?

02:56.677 --> 03:00.348
JUST NEED AN ADULT BRAIN
TO WORK THEIR CHILD'S BODY.
(closes drawer)

03:00.381 --> 03:01.349
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S MORE WORK

03:01.382 --> 03:03.317
PESTERING THEM
TO DO THEIR CHORES

03:03.351 --> 03:04.652
THAN TO JUST DO IT MYSELF.
YEAH.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.221
IT'S KIND OF LIKE PESTERING YOU
ABOUT A HOUSEKEEPER.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.923
SO BOTTOM LINE--
YOU'RE A NAG?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.024
OKAY.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.226
TALK TO
THE BERTMANS' HOUSEKEEPER.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.227
IF WE LIKE HER,
WE'LL PUT HER ON.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.363
GOOD, GOOD. THANK YOU.
COOL. ALL RIGHT.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.364
OKAY, THANKS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.266
IF I HAVE TO DO
LESS HOUSEWORK,

03:18.299 --> 03:20.200
THEN I MIGHT HAVE
MORE ENERGY FOR OTHER STUFF,

03:20.234 --> 03:22.336
YOU KNOW, AT NIGHT.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.705
(inhales sharply)
TONIGHT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.244
YOU KNOW,
MANDY IS NOT THE ONLY ONE

03:30.278 --> 03:32.246
SKIMPING ON HER CHORES.
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.248
HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY.

03:34.282 --> 03:38.286
-- Captions by VITA --

03:38.319 --> 03:42.122
(whirring)

03:43.324 --> 03:45.058
OH.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.261
(turns off vacuum cleaner)
OH, DID YOU WANT SOMETHING,
MISS VANESSA?

03:47.295 --> 03:49.797
OH, NO, THANK YOU, BLANCA.
I JUST NEED A BREAK.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.266
WORKING FROM HOME
USED TO MEAN PLAYING HOOKY,

03:52.300 --> 03:54.802
BUT, UH, TELECONFERENCING
HAS RUINED EVERYTHING.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.437
AM I RIGHT, BLANCA?

03:56.470 --> 03:59.039
OH, YES. I WAS JUST SAYING
THE SAME THING

03:59.072 --> 04:02.376
ON THE BUS THIS MORNING.
(chuckles)

04:02.410 --> 04:04.244
SIT AND REST.
I MADE YOU SOME TEA.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.381
OH, BLANCA.
THAT'S SO SWEET.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.982
THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOW.
(knock on door)

04:09.016 --> 04:10.818
OH. RELAX.
I'LL GET IT.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.422
OKAY. OKAY.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.556
HELLO. MAY I HELP YOU?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.558
HI. IS VANESSA HOME?

04:17.591 --> 04:18.792
MISS VANESSA'S
HAVING HER AFTERNOON TEA.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.294
MAY I ASK WHO'S CALLING?

04:20.328 --> 04:22.596
(Vanessa) CAROL?

04:22.630 --> 04:25.065
HI. HI.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.067
HI, HI. COME ON IN. HI.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.438
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT
YOUR AFTERNOON TEA.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.406
(chuckles)
THIS IS, UH, BLANCA.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.974
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE ANSWERED THE DOOR.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.743
SHE--SHE NEVER DOES THAT.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.512
OH, I WILL TRY TO BE BETTER
ABOUT THAT, MISS VANESSA.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.813
NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.282
AND--AND PLEASE,
JUST CALL ME "VANESSA."

04:42.316 --> 04:45.185
I-I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE DID THAT, EITHER.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.654
COME IN. COME IN.
YEAH, I CAN'T STAY LONG.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.522
OKAY.
I TRIED YOUR WHITE CHOCOLATE
BROWNIE RECIPE,

04:48.556 --> 04:50.257
AND IF I'M GONNA
GAIN 5 POUNDS,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.793
THEN SO ARE YOU.
(laughs)

04:52.826 --> 04:54.462
I'LL BRING ANOTHER CUP
FOR MISS CAROL.
OH, THANKS.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.463
HERE. COME ON IN.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.930
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD A MAID?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.599
WHAT? OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.300
UH, BLANCA'S NOT A MAID.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.370
SHE JUST, UH, HELPS OUT
A FEW DAYS A WEEK,

05:02.403 --> 05:04.738
JUST, YOU KNOW,
COOKING, CLEANING.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.476
LIKE A MAID.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.211
Y-YOU KNOW, I-I DON'T
REALLY LIKE THAT WORD.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.614
BLANCA--SHE'S MORE
OF A FRIEND...

05:13.647 --> 05:16.684
I PAY...

05:16.717 --> 05:18.619
TO... DO... MAID STUFF.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.489
YOU KNOW, COME ON.
SIT DOWN. LET'S--LET'S GET FAT.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.492
AH, THANK YOU. HERE.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.495
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BLANCA, WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN

05:27.528 --> 05:29.129
AND JOIN US FOR SOME TEA?
(clatter)

05:29.162 --> 05:31.365
OH, NO, NO.
WHEN I SIT, I FEEL LAZY.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.401
I'LL KEEP VACUUMING.
NO, I INSIST. COME ON.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.702
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
A WEEK ALREADY,

05:34.735 --> 05:37.337
AND WE'VE HARDLY
HAD A CHANCE TO TALK.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.306
SO, UH, BLANCA,

05:39.339 --> 05:42.309
UH, WHAT DO YOU DO
ON YOUR DAY OFF?

05:42.342 --> 05:45.679
I CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.520
OH. YOU NEED A TEACUP.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.754
OH.
SO HERE, YOU TAKE MINE,
AND, UH,

05:53.787 --> 05:54.922
I'LL GET ANOTHER ONE.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.557
OH, I'M SORRY.
I-I TRACKED SOME DIRT IN.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.992
I-I'LL GET IT.
BLANCA, SIT, SIT.
SIT, SIT.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.061
I KNOW HOW
TO USE A VACUUM.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.565
(vacuum whirring)

06:20.414 --> 06:21.381
(gasps)

06:21.415 --> 06:23.451
OH, GOD. (laughs)
(turns off vacuum cleaner)

06:23.484 --> 06:25.453
HI. HI. MWAH.
HI.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.454
SO...
HI.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.588
HEY, SO WHAT'S, UH,

06:27.621 --> 06:32.025
WHAT'S WRONG

06:32.059 --> 06:33.461
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.863
YEAH, MIKE. WHAT EXACTLY IS
WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.531
IS THIS WHY
YOU HIRED A HOUSEKEEPER,

06:37.565 --> 06:38.532
TO WATCH YOU DO HOUSEWORK?

06:38.566 --> 06:39.533
UH, I'M SORRY.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.535
NO, BLANCA, PLEASE SIT.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.104
I-I'LL GET EVERYTHING.
JUST...
SHOULDN'T YOU FINISH
YOUR VACUUMING FIRST?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.807
WELL, I SHOULD GO.
ALTHOUGH I'D LOVE TO STAY

06:46.840 --> 06:49.042
AND WATCH VANESSA
DO THE WINDOWS.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.377
OH, CAROL...

06:50.410 --> 06:51.378
SAY HI TO CHUCK.
BYE-BYE.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.547
SEE YOU LATER.
SO, HONEY, UH,

HOW'S BLANCA WORKING OUT?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.084

06:57.117 --> 06:58.886

07:01.955 --> 07:04.658
IS THAT A FROSTED MUG?

07:04.692 --> 07:07.227
YES, MR. MIKE.
AN ICE-COLD BEER.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.329
NOW SIT. YOU MUST RELAX.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.799
OF COURSE I MUST. YEAH.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.966
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.101
UH, PECANS WITH CHILI.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.003
I THINK YOU WILL LIKE
THE SPICE OF THE NUTS

07:16.036 --> 07:17.771
WITH THE BITTERNESS
OF THE CERVEZA.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.939
YEAH.
MM-HMM.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.173
MMM. (mouth full) I LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.676
LET ME TRY
A LITTLE BITTERNESS.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.916
HEY, I LIKE THIS.
THIS IS GOOD.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.452
HOW COME YOU NEVER
MAKE THIS FOR ME?

07:32.486 --> 07:35.723
NUTS AND BEER.
I'LL ASK HER FOR THE RECIPE.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.526
DAD...
YEAH?

07:38.559 --> 07:41.194
SO, UM, I NEED $35

07:41.228 --> 07:42.596

THIS STUPID PERMISSION SLIP.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.764
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO--
EVE. EVE.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.965
DEJE DE MOLESTAR A TU PADRE.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.166

07:46.199 --> 07:47.801
STOP BOTHERING YOUR FATHER.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.705
BUT HE HAS TO SIGN--
OH, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,

07:51.739 --> 07:53.541
EXCEPT RELAX.

07:53.574 --> 07:58.045
HE IS EL PADRE--
THE FATHER.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.013
AND HE WILL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN HE'S READY

08:00.047 --> 08:02.282
TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR FIELD TRIPS.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.817
UH, DAD?

08:03.851 --> 08:06.453
I THINK SHE'S GOT
A POINT, HONEY.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.890
OKAY, NEW RULE--
NO ONE SPEAKS TO EL PADRE

08:09.923 --> 08:11.959
FOR A HALF-HOUR AFTER--
EH, EH, EH, EH...

08:11.992 --> 08:14.695
FOR AN HOUR AFTER WORK.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.130
NOW GO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.566
BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANY HOMEWORK.

08:18.599 --> 08:23.837
AY, NO QUIERO OIRLO. VAMONOS!
(speaks Spanish indistinctly)

08:23.871 --> 08:25.505
"EL PADRE"?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.407
EH, EH, EH, EH...

08:37.350 --> 08:40.487
YEAH, VANESSA GOT US
A MAID--BLANCA.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.056
A MAID? ISN'T THAT
WHAT DAUGHTERS ARE FOR? HMM?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.391
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.826
IF YOU EVER WANT
TO GET RID OF HER,

08:45.859 --> 08:49.963
JUST LEAVE SCHWARZENEGGER'S
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OPEN TO PAGE 214.

08:51.932 --> 08:56.036
THAT'S WHERE HE INTRODUCES HER
TO HIS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.738
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO GET RID OF HER.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.339
VANESSA LIKES HER.
I LIKE HER.
MM-HMM.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.074
SHE DID A HECK OF A JOB
ON THIS SHIRT.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.175
(sniffs)

09:02.209 --> 09:03.777
MMM. SMELLS LIKE THE OCEAN.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.812
DOESN'T IT?
YEAH.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.551
FEELS LIKE
A BABY'S BOTTOM.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.853
KYLE, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU

09:12.886 --> 09:15.088
TO REMOVE YOUR HEAD
FROM MY SHOULDER. THANKS.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.289
IT'S JUST REALLY SOFT.
IT IS, RIGHT?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.025
SHE KNOWS HER WAY
AROUND SOME FABRIC SOFTENER.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.860
YEAH, MY UNDERWEAR MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M SITTING ON A CLOUD.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.395
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE
MY WORD FOR THAT.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.967
LOOKS LIKE THIS BLANCA'S
REALLY WORKING OUT, HUH?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.269
YEAH. YEAH.
GOTTA RESPECT HER, MAN.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.538
TOOK HER EIGHT YEARS
TO GET HER GREEN CARD.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.741
MM-HMM. MOST PEOPLE
NEVER GET THEIR GREEN CARDS.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.475
RIGHT, WELL, WE CHECKED
EVERYBODY AROUND HERE, RIGHT?

09:35.508 --> 09:38.779
OH, SURE, SURE, SURE.
SALES, H.R., ACCOUNTING...

09:38.812 --> 09:40.313
EVERYBODY
ON THE LOADING DOCK?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.415
CASHIERS, MARKETING,
MANAGEMENT...

09:42.449 --> 09:44.584
AND EVERYONE
ON THE LOADING DOCK?

09:44.618 --> 09:45.585
I'M SURE EVERYTHING'S FINE.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.387
J.J. RUNS A TIGHT SHIP
DOWN THERE.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.322
WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE YOU NEVER CHECKED,

09:49.356 --> 09:50.490
DID YOU, ED?

09:50.523 --> 09:52.392
I MAKE IT A POLICY
NOT TO GO LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.595
THAT'S WHY I DON'T HAVE
PROSTATE EXAMS.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.431
WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU GOT YOUR HEAD UP THERE,

09:58.465 --> 09:59.499
LOOK AROUND.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.069
IF WE'RE VIOLATING
IMMIGRATION LAWS,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.905
WE'RE SUBJECT
TO BIG FINES, ED.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.073
LOOK,
A COMPANY AS BIG AS OURS

10:06.106 --> 10:09.342
IS BOUND TO USE
SOME UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.610
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS
TO FILL.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.312
THEY'RE AFFORDABLE,
HARDWORKING, AND HONEST.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.647
IF THEY'RE SO HONEST,

10:13.681 --> 10:15.348
WHY ARE THEY WILLING
TO GO UNDER THE FLOOR OF A VAN

10:15.382 --> 10:16.583
TO GET IN THIS COUNTRY?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.318
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO BETTER THEIR LIVES.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.319
YOU'D DO THE SAME.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.620
YOU'D GO TO HELL AND BACK
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.423
THAT'S THE PROBLEM--
THEY NEVER GO BACK.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.491
WHERE YOU GOING, MIKE?

10:24.524 --> 10:26.426
WELL, I'M GONNA TRY
H.R. FIRST.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.427
IF THERE'S A MESS
DOWNSTAIRS,

10:27.460 --> 10:28.829
I GOTTA TRY
TO CLEAN THIS UP.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.263
WELL, GOOD LUCK TRYING
TO CLEAN UP

10:30.297 --> 10:32.365
SOMETHING IN THIS COUNTRY
WITHOUT USING ILLEGALS.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.603
COME ON! LET'S MOVE!

10:36.636 --> 10:38.371
WE HAVE TEN MINUTES
TO UNLOAD THAT TRUCK,

10:38.405 --> 10:41.141
BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
RIGHT BEHIND IT! LET'S GO!

10:41.174 --> 10:43.543
LOOK HOW J.J.
HAS THIS PLACE HUMMING.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.545
IT'S LIKE SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.

10:45.578 --> 10:49.349
I BET SWIMMING IS HOW
SOME OF THESE GUYS GOT HERE.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.852
HEY, LOOK, IT'S MANAGEMENT!
EVERYBODY LOOK BUSY!

10:51.885 --> 10:54.788
OH, WAIT. WE ALREADY ARE,
'CAUSE I'M DOING MY JOB.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.623
ED, MIKE.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.326
YOU GUYS GET LOST
ON THE WAY TO THE GOLF COURSE?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.294
ACTUALLY, WE'RE DOWN HERE
LOOKING FOR A CADDY.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.495
YEAH.
(laughs)

11:02.529 --> 11:04.131
HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?
GREAT.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.799
HEY, CHECK OUT
THE HANDS ON MARTINEZ.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.334
I THINK WE FOUND
THE SECOND BASEMAN

11:07.367 --> 11:08.401
FOR OUR SOFTBALL TEAM.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.403
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M THE SECOND BASEMAN.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.506
WHY DON'T WE HAVE THIS
AWKWARD CONVERSATION LATER?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.476
I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING,
J.J.,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.678
BUT WE HAVE TO CHECK
EVERYONE'S WORK DOCUMENTS.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.647
WHAT'S GOING ON, ED?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.515
NEVER BOTHERED ME
ABOUT THIS STUFF BEFORE.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.084
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT ED'S IDEA.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.552
IT'S FOR ME.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
YEAH.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.654
WELL, I KIND OF DO. YOU PAY ME
TO GET THESE TRUCKS OUT ON TIME.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.224
IT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER FOR
THESE GUYS TO FIND ALL THEIR...

11:31.258 --> 11:34.227
PAPERS.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.563
OKAY. (clears throat)
UH, LET'S GO, GUYS.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.697
GUYS, I APPRECIATE IT.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.733
H.R. NEEDS TO
TAKE A LOOK AT 'EM.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.535
I'LL HAVE 'EM
RIGHT BACK TO YOU.
OKAY, I'VE GOT SIX RIGHT HERE.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.337
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE GOT EVERYBODY'S?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.307
THANKS, GUYS.
MIKE. UH...

11:53.480 --> 11:55.582
SORRY.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.591
IT'S GONNA BE A REAL DRAG
LOSING J.J.

12:04.624 --> 12:07.294
HE'S BEEN AROUND OUTDOOR MAN
FOR OVER TEN YEARS.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.229
I'VE KNOWN HIM LONGER
THAN I'VE KNOWN EVE.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.698
HONEY, EVE'S 14.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.733
YEAH, BUT SHE WASN'T
ALL THAT INTERESTING

12:13.767 --> 12:15.468
TILL AFTER SHE WAS 5.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.737
(switch clicks)

12:17.771 --> 12:19.539
YOU KNOW, AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING

12:19.572 --> 12:21.574
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
ARE BREAKING THE LAW,

12:21.608 --> 12:23.110
HENCE THE WORD "ILLEGAL"?

12:23.143 --> 12:26.279
I KNOW, BUT HE'S PART
OF THE OUTDOOR MAN FAMILY.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.281
HE'S PRACTICALLY
PART OF OUR FAMILY.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.482
GOSH, REMEMBER THAT TIME

12:29.516 --> 12:31.885
THAT HE DRESSED UP LIKE
THE EASTER BUNNY FOR THE KIDS?

12:31.919 --> 12:34.421
(chuckles)
YEAH. TRIPPED OVER
THE GARDEN HOSE ON THE WAY OUT,

12:34.454 --> 12:36.824
HEAD POPPED OFF.
MANDY TO THIS DAY

12:36.857 --> 12:40.293
THINKS RABBITS
HAVE MEXICANS INSIDE OF THEM.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.395
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:42.429 --> 12:45.298
I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT
OF MEXICAN INSIDE YOU.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.768
WHY?
COULDN'T STOP
EATING BLANCA'S BURRITOS.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.971
MAN.
THOSE DIDN'T HAVE MEAT.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.640
THERE WAS JUST BEANS IN 'EM.
THEY WERE GREAT.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.143
IT'S, UH...

12:56.176 --> 12:58.912
IT'S GONNA BE
A ROUGH NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

12:58.946 --> 13:00.914
I SHOULD JUST APOLOGIZE
IN ADVANCE, SHOULDN'T I?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.682
YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.453
YOU KNOW, POOR J.J.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.356
BOY, TWO KIDS, NO JOB.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.658
AND FINDING A JOB THAT'S EVEN
CLOSE TO THE ONE HE HAD,

13:11.691 --> 13:13.660
IT'S GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.962
IT'S NUTS.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.429
MM.
AND THEN LOOK AT BLANCA.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.465
SHE DID IT THE RIGHT WAY,
LEGALLY,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.100
WENT THROUGH CHANNELS,
BECAME A CITIZEN, YOU KNOW?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.935
BOY, CAN SHE COOK. WOW.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.603
MMM.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.838
MM.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.177
OH! MIKE! GOD!

13:30.210 --> 13:31.278
(laughs)

13:31.311 --> 13:33.280
CONTROL YOURSELF!

13:33.313 --> 13:36.116
GET SOME MATCHES.
(laughs)

13:45.325 --> 13:46.726
SO WAIT. BLANCA'S NOT EVEN
COMING HERE TODAY?

13:46.759 --> 13:49.496
SHE WAS HERE YESTERDAY.
(knock on door)

13:49.529 --> 13:51.664
SHE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW.
SO SHE'S NOT COMING AT ALL?

13:51.698 --> 13:54.201
BUT SHE DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
MY SPANISH HOMEWORK.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.803
BLANCA'S DOING YOUR SPANISH.
I'M DOING YOUR HISTORY.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.238
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
REALLY TELL YOUR TEACHERS

13:58.271 --> 13:59.406
THEY'RE GIVING US
TOO MUCH HOMEWORK.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.876
(knock)

14:02.910 --> 14:04.377
HEY, WHY DON'T I GET THAT?

14:04.411 --> 14:07.547
YEAH, I'LL GET IT.
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M UP.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.316
UH... (mutters indistinctly)

14:09.349 --> 14:11.384
(sighs)
(knock)

14:11.418 --> 14:14.121
HEY, YEAH.
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, MAN.
(chuckles)

14:16.223 --> 14:17.157
HEY.
WHAT'S UP, LARABEE?

14:17.190 --> 14:20.928
HEY, BAXTER. I HEARD
YOU GOT YOURSELF A MAID.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.595
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
PROPERTY VALUES PLUMMETED

14:22.629 --> 14:23.830
WHEN YOU MOVED IN.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.000
I'M TRYING TO SPRUCE IT UP
ON THE INSIDE.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.937
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF THAT HILLBILLY TRUCK

14:29.970 --> 14:32.039
YOU ALWAYS GOT PARKED OUT FRONT
WITH THE GUN RACK?

14:32.072 --> 14:35.108
ANYWAY, CAROL FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOUR MAID,

14:35.142 --> 14:37.744
AND, UH, NOW WE HAVE TO
GET ONE, TOO,

14:37.777 --> 14:40.013
SO THANKS FOR THAT.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.248
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.783
NOT MAKE MY WIFE HAPPY
TO SAVE YOU A FEW BUCKS?

14:43.816 --> 14:46.419
WELL, I'D APPRECIATE THAT,
YEAH.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.421
AND YOU WANDERED DOWN FROM
YOUR HOUSE JUST TO TELL ME THAT?

14:48.455 --> 14:50.223
NO, NO, NOT QUITE.
IS KRISTIN AROUND?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.858
OH, HEY, MR. LARABEE.
COME ON IN.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.261
HEY, HEY. JUST CAME BY
TO DROP OFF THE KEY.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.295
WHAT'S THE KEY FOR?

14:55.328 --> 14:56.763
TO MY HOUSE.

14:56.796 --> 15:00.167
MY HOUSEKEEPER CAN'T GET
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT A KEY.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.272
HOU--HOUSEKEEPER?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.440
UH, HEY, I GAVE YOU
FIRST DIBS ON MY SERVICES.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.043
HIS HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE
A BUNCH OF SLOBBY KIDS.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.213
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH
HER CLEANING MY HOUSE, MIKE?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.581
I GOT A PROBLEM WITH HER

15:14.614 --> 15:16.449
CLEANING ANY HOUSE
SHE DOESN'T LIVE IN.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.251
YOU COULD PAY ME
WHAT YOU PAY BLANCA.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.552
OH, THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT--

15:19.586 --> 15:22.822
OH, SO YOU TRYING
TO STEAL MY MAID, BAXTER?

15:22.855 --> 15:25.092
SHE'S NOT YOUR MAID.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.793
I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU TWO
TO SORT THIS OUT.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.129
SEE YOU, KRISTIN.
AND THANKS, MIKE.

15:29.162 --> 15:33.566
YOU KNOW, THIS HOUSEKEEPER THING
ISN'T JUST MAKING MY WIFE HAPPY.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.669
I'M SUDDENLY PRETTY HAPPY
ABOUT IT, TOO.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.306
(laughs)

15:39.339 --> 15:41.141
(door closes)

15:41.174 --> 15:43.676
(knock on door)

15:43.710 --> 15:47.514
HEY, ED. DID YOU TAKE CARE OF
EVERYTHING IN THE LOADING DOCK?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.583
I'M PROMOTING RAPHAEL
TO FOREMAN.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.684
RAPHAEL?

15:51.718 --> 15:52.852
YEAH, THE GUYS SEEM
TO LOOK UP TO HIM.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.089
MUST BE THE FUR
AROUND HIS LICENSE PLATE.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.090
(knock on door)

15:57.124 --> 15:59.159
ED. MIKE.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.427
HEY, J.J.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.195
JUST CAME BY
TO RETURN MY BADGE...

16:02.229 --> 16:03.530
AND MY GUN.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.001
I SCANNED A LOT OF BAR CODES
WITH THIS BABY.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.204
I REALLY JUST CAME BY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.372
YEAH, WELL, I'M SORRY
IT WENT DOWN LIKE THIS, J.J.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.773
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.208
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.609
I'VE GOT A COUSIN
IN AMARILLO,

16:16.643 --> 16:19.112
GOT ME A JOB AS A DISHWASHER
AT A TRUCK STOP ON I-10.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.781
GET A DOG
AND A CHEATIN' GIRLFRIEND,

16:21.814 --> 16:24.184
YOU GOT A COUNTRY SONG.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.019
IT'S HONEST WORK.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.987
DO WHAT I DO
FOR MY FAMILY.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.191
YEAH.
THIS IS NUTS, J.J.
THIS IS NUTS, MAN.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.725
OH, HEY, IT'S OKAY, MIKE.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.395
I'M THANKFUL
FOR THE TEN YEARS I HAD.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.396
YOU'RE A GREAT BOSS.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.065
AND YOU'RE A GREAT FOREMAN.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.832
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A DISHWASHER, MAN.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.368
YOU'RE REALLY NOT
A DISHWASHER.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.036
I'VE SEEN THE COFFEE CUP
YOU LEAVE IN THE SINK HERE.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.038
IT'S GOT THIS CRUST ON
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET OFF.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.707
DO ME A FAVOR.
JUST HANG HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.142
LET ME HAVE
A TALK WITH ED.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.010
MAYBE GO TRY
TO WASH THAT CUP OFF.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.415
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.150
I'M THINKING WE NEED HIM
ON THE LOADING DOCK.
(door closes)

16:57.184 --> 16:58.818
HE'S TOO VALUABLE.
YOU GOTTA KEEP HIM SOMEHOW.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.019
THAT'S EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, MIKE. THAT'S...
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.821
YESTERDAY I LOOKED
AT THE IMMIGRATION WEB SITE,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.323
AND THERE'S A WAY
YOU CAN KEEP HIM HERE

17:03.356 --> 17:05.358
UNDER SPONSORSHIP IF THEY'RE
VITAL TO OUR BUSINESS.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.893
THAT'S GONNA COST
A LOT OF MONEY.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.261
WELL, YOU GOT A LOT OF MONEY,
AND IT WAS YOUR PROBLEM.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.063
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT STARTED THIS,

17:10.097 --> 17:12.399
AND YOU GOTTA FIX THIS.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.235
WELL, OKAY. YOU KNOW,
THIS--THIS JUST COULD WORK OUT.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.503
THIS COULD WORK OUT.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.738
REMEMBER I HAVE--I HAVE
THAT GREAT IMMIGRATION LAWYER?

17:18.771 --> 17:21.441
ALL RIGHT.
REMEMBER
MY PSYCHO GIRLFRIEND SVETLANA?

17:21.474 --> 17:22.442
YEAH, WELL, HOW GREAT IS HE?
YEAH.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.910
HE GOT HER SHIPPED
BACK TO UKRAINE.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.011
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND THAT WASN'T EASY,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.547
BECAUSE SHE WAS
BORN IN KANSAS.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.122
HEY. HI, BLANCA.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.523
OH, HELLO, MR. MIKE.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.458
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
I'M GOOD.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.127
WOW, YOU LOOK
VERY HAPPY.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.462
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM VERY HAPPY.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.531
LIKE MY UNCLE
AFTER HE PICKED GRAPES ALL DAY

17:44.564 --> 17:47.400
AND MADE ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY A WHORE. HMM.

17:55.475 --> 17:59.246
I DON'T KNOW
THAT I'M, UH, WHORE-HAPPY.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.714
BUT I MIGHT HAVE SAVED
A GUY'S JOB TODAY.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.550
(bottle fizzes)
AND THAT'S
A REALLY GOOD FEELING.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.318
(bottle cap clatters)
OH, WORK IS GOOD.
A MAN NEEDS WORK.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.786
YEAH.
(bottles rattle)

18:06.819 --> 18:08.621
HEY, BLANCA, I NEED TWO DOZEN
COOKIES FOR A BAKE SALE.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.123
MAKE YOUR OWN COOKIES.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.959
THERE'S A TUBE OF CRAP IN THERE
THAT TURNS INTO COOKIES.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.794
CAN'T BLANCA MAKE 'EM
FROM SCRATCH?
(mug clatters)

18:14.827 --> 18:16.829
IT'LL SHOW
HOW I REALLY CARE.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.631
OATMEAL RAISIN, POR FAVOR.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.501
OKAY. IT'S OKAY, MR. MIKE.
I DON'T MIND.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.736
I LIKE DOING THINGS
FOR PEOPLE.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.938
WELL, YOU GOT A VERY GOOD
WORK ETHIC, THAT'S WHY.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.275
WELL, YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE LAZY IN MY COUNTRY.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.509
YOU KNOW, WHEN MY BROTHER

18:29.542 --> 18:31.411
REFUSED TO CLEAN
MY UNCLE'S FISHING BOAT,

18:31.444 --> 18:34.013
THEY BURIED HIM IN THE SAND
UP TO HIS NECK,

18:34.046 --> 18:35.248
RUBBED A FISH ON HIS HEAD,

18:35.282 --> 18:39.786
AND LEFT HIM
TO LOS GATOS DE LA PLAYA.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.322
(under breath)
LOS GATOS DE LA PLAYA...

18:42.355 --> 18:44.424
(normal voice)
BEACH CATS?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.492
Sí.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.361
AND THOSE CATS
ARE NOT NICE KITTIES.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.830
I LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING.
I LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.466
AND I'M NOT USUALLY
A CAT GUY.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.635
AH, HEY.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.438
HI, BABY.
WHAT A DAY AT WORK.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.607
NICE TO SEE
A FRIENDLY FACE.
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.509
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT BLANCA.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.645
SO WAS I.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.980
OH...

19:08.014 --> 19:09.382
HERE'S YOUR DRESS, MISS MANDY.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.284
I FIXED THE HEM
AND SEWED ON A BUTTON.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.486
AW. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO IRON IT?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.888
OH, WELL,
IT'S FASTER TO STEAM IT.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.657
COME. WE'LL HANG IT
IN THE SHOWER.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.226
YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.528
WE'RE PAYING SOMEONE TO TEACH
OUR KIDS HOW NOT TO WORK.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.463
WE CAN'T CONTINUE THIS WAY
WITH BLANCA.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.464
HONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.566
I AM NOT GIVING HER UP.
I CAN'T GO BACK.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.235
HEY, HEY, HEY...
NO, I CAN'T.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.570
OH, HEY, BOYD, HONEY,
YOU DROPPED YOUR NAPKIN.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.406
IT'S OKAY.
BLANCA WILL PICK IT UP.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.741
HOLD IT. HO, HO, HO.
GET OVER HERE A SECOND.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.476
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"BLANCA WILL PICK IT UP"?

19:36.509 --> 19:37.477
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.679
SHE'S MY CLEAN-UP GIRL.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.181
OH, IS SHE?
OH. HOLD ON A SECOND.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.816
HEY, BLANCA,
WOULD YOU BRING THE GIRLS?

19:43.850 --> 19:45.418
GIRLS, GIRLS,
GET IN HERE A SECOND!

19:45.452 --> 19:46.719
MIKE. MIKE, HONEY,
MIKE, PLEASE...
JUST--JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.555
JUST DON'T DO
ANYTHING RASH, ALL RIGHT?

19:48.588 --> 19:49.556
IF YOU GOTTA GET RID
OF SOMEBODY,

19:49.589 --> 19:51.491
PICK ONE OF THE KIDS.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.260
BLANCA, JUST FOR A SECOND.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.328
LISTEN. GIRLS,
YOU'RE PART OF THIS, TOO.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.496
YOU DO A GREAT JOB
AROUND HERE.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.865
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS TURNED
MY KIND OF LAZY GIRLS

19:58.898 --> 20:00.533
INTO REAL LAZY GIRLS.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.901
UM, IN FAIRNESS
TO BLANCA, THOUGH,

20:01.934 --> 20:04.571
I WAS ALREADY PRETTY LAZY.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.572
HERE'S WHAT
I WANT YOU TO DO.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.073
I WANT YOU TO TREAT MY KIDS

20:07.106 --> 20:08.608
LIKE YOUR UNCLE
TREATED YOUR BROTHER.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.876
WELL, YOU DON'T MEAN...

20:09.909 --> 20:11.544
RELEASE THE BEACH CATS.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.546
I WANNA START WITH BOYD

20:13.580 --> 20:15.515
AND THAT PAPER
HE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.217
OKAY. MIJO, PICK THAT UP.
PUT IT IN THE TRASH.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.853
EVE, PREHEAT THE TIMER FOR 350
AND TAKE OUT THE COOKIE DOUGH.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.455
MANDY, GO UPSTAIRS,

20:22.489 --> 20:24.557
START THE SHOWER
TO STEAM YOUR DRESS.

20:24.591 --> 20:28.561
LET'S GO! MOVE IT!
COME ON! RáPIDO!

20:30.397 --> 20:31.531
BUT, BLANCA, I...
AH-AH-AH!

20:31.564 --> 20:33.700
AND IF ANYONE TALKS BACK TO ME,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.503
I WILL LAUGH
AS THE CATS CLAW OUT YOUR EYES!

20:37.737 --> 20:40.707
NOT MY EYES!
ALL RIGHT, HEY, HEY,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.575
YOU MIGHT WANNA TONE DOWN
THE CAT-EYE-SCRATCHING THING.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.076
NO. I WILL DO THE...
(speaks indistinctly)

20:52.585 --> 20:54.253
MM. I LOVE THAT SHOW.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.289
(crunching) YEAH.
WE TOTALLY HAVE TO COME UP
WITH AN IDEA FOR "SHARK TANK."

20:56.323 --> 20:57.657
MM-HMM.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.826
WE SHOULD INVENT
A GIANT GLASS BOWL...
OKAY.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.595
AND FILL IT WITH WATER...
YEAH.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.931
WHERE PREDATORY
SEA CREATURES COULD LIVE.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.433
HMM. PRETTY GOOD.
YEAH.

21:06.466 --> 21:10.269
I LIKE IT.
I DON'T, LIKE, LOVE IT, BUT...

21:12.772 --> 21:14.841
OH, MY GOD.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.743
OH!

21:16.776 --> 21:18.411
YOU WERE DESCRIBING
AN ACTUAL SHARK TANK!

21:18.445 --> 21:19.412
(laughs)
OH, WOW.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.148
UH, CHICAS...
HUH?

21:22.181 --> 21:24.351
LET'S GO. LIMPIA TODO.
SORRY.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.019
RECOGELO.
RáPIDO, RáPIDO.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.055
NO QUIERES LOS BEACH CATS.
(hisses)
