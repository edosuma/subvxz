This isn't real.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.083
I'm telling you,
this all happened.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.215
Don't love the sound of
explosions in the morning.

01:25.259 --> 01:28.914
What did I say about
video games on school days?

01:28.958 --> 01:30.394
It's not a video game.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.222
It's the attack on Pearl Harbor.

01:35.138 --> 01:38.185
Mom, did all these people
really die?

01:38.228 --> 01:40.535
Many did, honey.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.319
But that's why we honor them
every year.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.060
And those who survived, too.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.280
Though I'm not sure
why your brother...

01:46.323 --> 01:48.456
is showing you this
before breakfast.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.153
Because she asked.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.199
It's for a project.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.896
She has to do a report

01:53.939 --> 01:57.160
about a hero who emerged after
the attack on Pearl Harbor.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.335
So did I, remember?

01:58.379 --> 02:00.076
I'm sure the emphasis
is more on "hero,"

02:00.120 --> 02:01.512
less on "attack."

02:01.556 --> 02:05.037
Mom, she's old enough
to know about the bad, too.

02:10.521 --> 02:13.916
Ah-ah. Stay put.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.961
Look, I appreciate
your enthusiasm, okay?

02:16.005 --> 02:18.486
But leave the decisions
about your sister up to me.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.661
I'm just trying to help.

02:19.704 --> 02:20.879
So you wouldn't mind
helping Julie

02:20.923 --> 02:22.185
find a hero for her project?

02:22.229 --> 02:24.274
That-that's not what I meant.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.276
- And taking her to school?
- But I-I...

02:26.320 --> 02:27.712
Love you.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.194
<i>No Jesse or Lucy?</i>

02:31.238 --> 02:32.500
They're running
security checks

02:32.543 --> 02:35.285
for the Pearl Harbor
Remembrance Day ceremony.

02:35.329 --> 02:38.680
All right, so the boss gets
the old bones in the dank cave.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.769
Never too senior
to get my feet wet.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.771
Hey, Commander Chase.
Who discovered them?

02:42.814 --> 02:45.948
Beachcomber searching
for buried treasure.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.297
And they were found in a cave?

02:47.341 --> 02:48.646
"The world's womb,"

02:48.690 --> 02:50.866
where life and death intersect.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.868
In this case, more so death.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.652
Everything looks
so intact.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.219
Sand, seaweed and sediment.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.352
All provided a barrier
for the elements.

02:58.395 --> 03:02.051
This poor soul has been forsaken
for... quite some time.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.749
Now's our chance to set it free.

03:06.011 --> 03:09.363
Sorry, sorry, just...
got caught up in the energy.

03:09.406 --> 03:10.668
Tellus heard you.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.758
Well, can you tell us anything
about the remains?

03:13.802 --> 03:15.760
Age? Identity?

03:15.804 --> 03:17.936
Size ten to 11 shoes,
length of the femur--

03:17.980 --> 03:20.374
all point to the remains
belonging to a man.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.549
- And a sailor.
- Hmm.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.246
Those look like
old Navy khakis.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.769
It's hard to tell
how old, though.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.554
Actually, that's
the easy part.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.512
We'll carbon-date
the textiles and bones

03:28.556 --> 03:29.905
as soon as we're back
at the lab.

03:29.948 --> 03:30.949
And the hard part?

03:30.993 --> 03:33.735
Finding your suspect.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.304
Exit wound.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.220
Shot in the back of the head.

03:40.263 --> 03:41.873
He was murdered.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.835
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh, sorry.

03:46.878 --> 03:50.186
No, I'm sorry. My head's
in this Force Protection Plan.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.840
A handful
of Pearl Harbor survivors

03:51.883 --> 03:53.276
are attending the ceremony
this week,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.626
not one of them
under 95 years old.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.498
Wow. Probably the last year

03:57.541 --> 03:59.717
most of them
will be able to make it.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.285
80th anniversary. Amazing.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.592
Totally, amazing. But
between the threat assessment

04:04.635 --> 04:07.247
and about a thousand meetings
that should've just been emails,

04:07.290 --> 04:09.161
- my body's about tapped out.
- Oh, come on.

04:09.205 --> 04:12.208
Time to show 'em that it's
"go" muscle, not "show" muscle.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.123
How are you this jaunty?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.255
Oh, it's not 'cause I ate

04:15.298 --> 04:17.213
all of Ernie's
chocolate espresso beans.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.736
'Cause I didn't.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.781
Not all of 'em.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.261
Careful, Luce--
I will blackmail you

04:21.304 --> 04:23.263
into to doing the rest
of my security interviews.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.873
You know that's not
the worst assignment, right?

04:24.916 --> 04:26.788
...codebreakers
worked tirelessly

04:26.831 --> 04:29.312
to crack
encrypted Japanese messages.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.792
Um, they managed

04:30.835 --> 04:32.707
to reveal details for the
invasion of Midway Island

04:32.750 --> 04:34.926
and helped shift the tide
of the war.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.059
Follow me.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.236
Wow. Who'd Whistler tee off

04:40.280 --> 04:42.586
to pull the short straw
on that assignment?

04:42.630 --> 04:45.589
Uh, maybe they chose her
because she's smart

04:45.633 --> 04:46.895
and knows history.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.636
Besides, what do you
actually know

04:48.679 --> 04:50.464
about the attack
on Pearl Harbor, hmm?

04:50.507 --> 04:54.381
Over 3,000 casualties,
19 ships lost or damaged,

04:54.424 --> 04:55.773
and, not many
people know this,

04:55.817 --> 04:58.123
but 68 civilians
were killed that day.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.177
PHRD Planning Committee?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.831
Going over
Protective Service Details

05:09.874 --> 05:12.224
for the commemoration before
we get back to the cold case.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.314
Oh, please don't use that term.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.967
- Protective Service Details?
- No.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.621
- Cold case.
They're like turtlenecks.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.015
You know, once you get in them,
they never really work out

05:20.058 --> 05:21.059
the way you wanted.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.322
All right, well,
love it or hate it,

05:22.365 --> 05:24.236
there's no statute
of limitations on murder.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.761
Our victim was shot to death
and washed up in this cave.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.371
Anyone want to guess
how long ago?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.372
Dude, just tell us.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.460
73 to 80 years old.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.940
Lucy...

05:31.983 --> 05:34.072
how did you pull that number?

05:34.116 --> 05:35.552
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're, like,

05:35.596 --> 05:36.727
eerily right.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.903
Carbon dating puts them
at that range.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.297
Well, details of the trousers.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.299
Textile analysis says
it's cotton.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.910
From what I can tell,
this particular uniform

05:45.954 --> 05:49.349
was in use
from the '30s to 1948.

05:49.392 --> 05:53.222
Except black shoes were more
widely worn starting spring

05:53.265 --> 05:54.528
of 1941.

05:54.571 --> 05:55.659
I'm impressed.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.879
But also so curious.I...

05:57.922 --> 05:59.446
went down a military
rabbit hole

05:59.489 --> 06:02.797
and I found out Coco Chanel
designed the Turks' uniforms.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.189
Don't suppose we found

06:04.233 --> 06:06.801
- the nameplate on the victim?
- Not that lucky.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.455
It's gonna be hard to identify
the victim.

06:08.498 --> 06:09.934
Commander Chase was able

06:09.978 --> 06:12.067
to extract the DNA,
but may not be enough

06:12.110 --> 06:14.112
to ID the victim on its own.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.288
Well, this particular uniform

06:16.332 --> 06:18.116
with the black shoes
were only worn

06:18.160 --> 06:20.292
by non-aviation officers
and chiefs.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.469
Lucy, check the archives
for any missing personnel

06:22.512 --> 06:24.993
that match that profile
and that date range.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.386
Can't we run the DNA

06:26.429 --> 06:28.431
against one
of those ancestry databases?

06:28.475 --> 06:31.347
Good idea. Get Ernie on it.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.394
Maybe you should give
turtlenecks another shot.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.178
Get out of here.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.745
Hey, Whistler.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.703
Whistler, you seemed focused.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.445
Uh, is this, uh,
one of those things

06:42.489 --> 06:43.577
where you pretend to talk
about work,

06:43.620 --> 06:45.056
but you really ask
about dinner?

06:45.100 --> 06:48.538
No. Actually, I'm headed
over to personnel records.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.366
Which happens to be close
to your office.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.281
And I'm not even
hungry for dinner.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.848
Oh, well,

06:53.891 --> 06:55.850
I guess we can walk together.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.678
Oh. Hmm.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.507
Don't suppose you
want to come with?

07:00.550 --> 07:04.424
There's this old case involving
old bones and a murder.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.687
Ooh, DIA doesn't do
bones and murders.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.906
Should be your slogan.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.648
Still, my case is
definitely more fun

07:11.692 --> 07:13.911
than having to
play tour guide.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.524
I didn't <i>have</i> to play
tour guide. I volunteered.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.700
Oh. Really?

07:19.743 --> 07:21.484
Those who fail to learn
from history

07:21.528 --> 07:22.964
are condemned to repeat it.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.706
It's an honor to host
these visitors.

07:25.749 --> 07:28.186
And get face time
with the brass.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.840
Honestly?

07:29.884 --> 07:33.104
I mean, you are interested
in your career.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.412
Wha... I...

07:36.456 --> 07:38.240
I didn't mean to offend you.

07:38.283 --> 07:41.025
Kind of makes it worse you think
I'm defined by ambition.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.071
I think you're defined
by a lot of things,

07:43.114 --> 07:44.594
some of which I don't
even know about yet,

07:44.638 --> 07:45.856
because I'm still getting...

07:53.647 --> 07:57.389
You don't know things about me
because you don't ask.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.740
I know you like
pinot grigio.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.830
And mason jars for cups.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.833
Excuse us.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.184
Can you move, please?

08:10.011 --> 08:12.013
Who are all those people?

08:12.056 --> 08:13.362
Your colleagues.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.017
Oh, yeah, right, but...

08:16.060 --> 08:17.540
what are they all doing there?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.064
Big event.
Pearl Harbor Remembrance.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.413
Kind of rings a bell.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.719
We've been sucked
into the black hole

08:22.763 --> 08:24.329
of DNA databases.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.157
I managed to pull DNA

08:26.201 --> 08:28.725
from the victim's skull
through the petrous bones

08:28.769 --> 08:29.987
behind the ear--

08:30.031 --> 08:31.728
a technique used
to extract DNA from bones

08:31.772 --> 08:34.731
found at the thousand-year-old
Antikythera shipwreck.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.211
Arr, matey.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.344
You're right.
Antikythera is in Greece.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.607
That reference makes no sense.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.912
You run the DNA

08:41.956 --> 08:43.305
against -the genealogical database?
- Once we got

08:43.348 --> 08:45.307
legal approval.
Take a look.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.658
Your tree's missing
some branches.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.486
In the United States, maybe.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.358
But the DNA's tied to all kinds
of families in Japan,

08:53.402 --> 08:55.099
so we looked
into Japanese immigrants.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.797
And we were able
to narrow the search further

08:56.840 --> 08:58.581
based on families
with naval officers

08:58.625 --> 09:00.104
or chiefs in the 1940s.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.845
- Any hits?
- Yes.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.281
One. But...

09:03.325 --> 09:05.806
this is where it gets weird.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.157
Her victim is...

09:09.853 --> 09:11.812
...him.

09:11.855 --> 09:12.987
Ken Ito.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.858
Ken Ito is a hundred-year-old

09:14.902 --> 09:16.207
Pearl Harbor attack survivor

09:16.251 --> 09:18.558
who's being honored
at this week's ceremony.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.298
All true.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.388
Except for the fact that
he was murdered 80 years ago.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.881
The Secretary of the Navy would
like to stress how delicate

09:37.925 --> 09:39.317
of a situationthis is.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.537
He respectfully asks
that we make sure

09:41.581 --> 09:44.496
the man he's about to honor
at the ceremony in two days

09:44.540 --> 09:46.368
is not in fact
an impostor

09:46.411 --> 09:47.761
or a murder suspect.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.066
We can't promise either.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.459
Ken Ito is

09:50.502 --> 09:51.808
a local legend.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.289
Served in the Navy
over 20 years and three wars.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.770
Then he retired and fought
for immigrant and civil rights.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.076
His daughter and grandson both
served on the islands in uniform

09:59.120 --> 10:00.948
and also in public office.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.602
They're a legacy family.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.081
Only the remains tell us

10:04.125 --> 10:06.301
that this guy
isn't actually Ken Ito.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.303
Looks like the real Ken Ito
was murdered

10:08.346 --> 10:10.435
as a Navy ensign in 1941.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.437
How could an identity switch
like that happen?

10:12.481 --> 10:13.656
Went through
his official

10:13.700 --> 10:15.353
military records--
things get hazy

10:15.397 --> 10:16.746
after the Pearl Harbor attack.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.879
Like all Japanese Americans
in uniform,

10:18.922 --> 10:21.577
stood down from service
for at least a year.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.840
Some went home.
Many were incarcerated

10:23.884 --> 10:25.973
at the internment camps--
it was chaos.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.496
Chaos makes for good cover.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.150
What about the people
Ito served with?

10:29.193 --> 10:30.717
His extended family?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.893
He didn't go back to the same
command after the attack.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.112
He was an only child.
Parents died young.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.985
And he seemed to have lost
contact with extended family

10:38.028 --> 10:39.334
before the war.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.423
All of this is based
on whether the DNA results

10:41.466 --> 10:43.251
are correct.

10:43.294 --> 10:47.385
Are we ready to accuse a hero
of being an impostor?

10:47.429 --> 10:48.691
DNA doesn't lie.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.258
Neither does the bullet hole

10:50.301 --> 10:52.042
- in the victim's skull.
- A bullet hole that

10:52.086 --> 10:54.871
tells us nothing besides he was
shot in the back of the head.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.046
We don't have other leads

10:56.090 --> 10:57.439
to actually solve
this murder.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.659
No evidence.
No motive. No suspects.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.312
You have him.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.361
<i>This should be interesting.</i>

11:06.404 --> 11:08.058
You mean because we're
about to interrogate

11:08.102 --> 11:11.148
a hundred-year-old war hero
about an 80-year-old murder?

11:11.192 --> 11:13.498
I told you, man.
Cold cases.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.849
Ms. Ito? Special Agents

11:15.892 --> 11:17.633
Holman and Boone. NCIS.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.462
Someone already
went over security protocols

11:20.505 --> 11:21.811
for the ceremony.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.378
Uh, we actually need to
speak with your father

11:23.421 --> 11:24.379
about another matter.

11:24.422 --> 11:25.772
He may have
information

11:25.815 --> 11:27.948
related to the disappearance
of a Naval officer.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.646
He hasn't served in the Navy
for 60 years.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.997
We just need to talk to him
and request a DNA sample.

11:34.041 --> 11:37.131
- Why would he have to do that?
- Well...

11:37.174 --> 11:40.003
this would go smoother
if we can just talk to him.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.789
I was in the Navy, too,

11:42.832 --> 11:45.095
and served
in the state legislature.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.228
Please, don't handle me.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.752
Look, I only know what it's like
to serve in one war.

11:49.796 --> 11:53.190
And your father--
he served in three.

11:54.496 --> 11:58.413
We have our jobs,
but he does have our respect.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.548
I'll take you to him.

12:03.592 --> 12:06.290
But I don't know if you'll get
what you're looking for.

12:10.164 --> 12:13.689
Dad's been suffering
from dementia a few years now.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.561
Ryan, will you
give us a minute?

12:16.605 --> 12:17.911
Yeah.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.608
Of course, Ms. V.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.697
Thank you.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.570
Excuse me, sir.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.269
May we ask you a few questions?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.275
This isn't working.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.412
Rank and serial number, sailor.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.682
Captain Ken Ito,

12:50.726 --> 12:53.033
9-5-2

12:53.076 --> 12:57.211
1-7-3-8-1.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.082
And when were you commissioned?

12:59.866 --> 13:02.564
June 27,

13:02.607 --> 13:05.393
1941.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.874
We found the remains of a sailor

13:07.917 --> 13:10.354
who might have served with you.

13:11.703 --> 13:12.879
Are you kidding?

13:12.922 --> 13:15.229
He's not gonna recognize
anyone based on...

13:15.272 --> 13:17.274
I know him.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.799
Dad?

13:19.842 --> 13:23.280
I met him in the fields.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.644
Hell doesn't have pineapple.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.261
My parents
agree with you.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.784
Was hoping
you could help with that.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.526
Or you could help me load
- this cart.
- I'm serious.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.832
I'm offering you a job.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.051
How would you like to help
Uncle Sam?

13:56.009 --> 13:58.750
- The Japanese
joining the Axis.

13:58.794 --> 14:02.450
The Americans don't want someone
like me working for them.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.191
Haven't kicked me out yet.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.802
I'm not you.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.370
You came here for opportunity.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.372
It's standing
right in front of you.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.374
But if you've grown fond
of the fields,

14:13.417 --> 14:16.333
I'll ask the next guy over.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.345
The man was issei.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.913
First-generation
Japanese.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.655
Issei were prohibited
from immigrating.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.613
They couldn't serve.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.877
But you recruited him?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.313
Needed help.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.705
For what?

14:41.532 --> 14:42.577
Do you remember

14:42.620 --> 14:45.362
the name
of the man in the field?

14:46.189 --> 14:48.104
Ken Ito.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.890
His name was Ken Ito?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.153
No. I'm Ken Ito.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.677
- That's the thing, sir.
It looks like

14:55.720 --> 14:58.462
Ken Ito actually died
80 years ago.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.856
My rake. Where's my rake?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.249
Sir, if you
don't mind... Vicky,

15:02.292 --> 15:04.468
Ryan, who are these men?

15:04.512 --> 15:06.601
Interview's over. Ryan.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.733
Leave. Now.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.526
He's convinced
he is Ken Ito.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.745
Probably can't remember
being anyone but.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.878
- Dementia doesn't help.
- It's strange, though.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.272
He told them a story
about pineapple fields.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.838
Ito's memory of the man
was triggered

15:26.882 --> 15:29.015
by the crime scene photo.
Could be a lead.

15:29.058 --> 15:32.279
Ito was involved with
the ROTC program here at UH.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.498
If he was recruiting
from there, too,

15:34.542 --> 15:35.412
maybe they have records

15:35.456 --> 15:37.197
of our impostor.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.981
Do you know anyone who
could help us look?

15:39.025 --> 15:41.679
I do, actually.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.073
<i>All right, have a great weekend.</i>

15:44.117 --> 15:46.336
I'll know
if you don't do the reading.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.772
Janey!

15:47.816 --> 15:49.296
Hey, I thought
you already learned

15:49.339 --> 15:51.994
everything you needed to
from me.
Oh, Maggie,

15:52.038 --> 15:54.518
we both know
I barely scratched the surface.

15:54.562 --> 15:57.043
Oh, come on.
How are my little darlings?

15:57.086 --> 15:58.609
Julie's busy working
on a project

15:58.653 --> 16:00.916
for Pearl Harbor
- Remembrance Day.
- Oh, wow.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.527
And Alex?
Trying to convince
her war is hell,

16:03.571 --> 16:05.442
despite the fact that
she's ten years old.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.270
She's very mature.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.142
And so curious
and adaptable.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.665
And she gets it all from you.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.623
And, I think, a little from me.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.451
So I assume
you're not here

16:14.495 --> 16:16.801
for help
with a fourth grade project.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.761
I need access
to the ROTC archives.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.372
I figured since you
have some ROTC staff

16:22.416 --> 16:24.331
in your graduate seminar... Yeah,

16:24.374 --> 16:26.202
but not just anybody
gets access.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.378
But you're not just anybody.

16:30.946 --> 16:34.341
So, you're saying
that <i>the</i> Ken Ito

16:34.384 --> 16:36.517
is some kind of impostor?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.693
It's looking very likely.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.521
Well, if you're
gonna steal a life,

16:40.564 --> 16:42.610
you may as well
make it a good one.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.177
Doesn't bother you?

16:44.220 --> 16:47.180
Oh, well, yeah, of course.

16:47.223 --> 16:51.184
But, oh, Janey, identity
is what we make of it.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.186
We're all impostors.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.536
We all have a story
that we tell ourselves

16:55.579 --> 16:57.973
until we forget
that it's make-believe.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.584
This Ito was
just more committed.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.847
Not much
of anything now.

17:02.891 --> 17:05.894
Hmm.
Spends his days
raking a Zen garden.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.636
Ah, the Japanese believe it
to be a metaphor

17:08.679 --> 17:10.725
for the journey
to inner understanding.

17:10.768 --> 17:11.987
Well, I wish he'd share

17:12.031 --> 17:13.554
some of that inner understanding
with us.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.946
It's possible that
the real Ken Ito

17:14.990 --> 17:17.775
was recruiting
Japanese immigrants for service.

17:17.819 --> 17:21.083
One of them killed him
and took on his identity.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.085
Japanese immigrants
weren't allowed to serve,

17:23.129 --> 17:25.957
and no laborer could afford
to enroll in the university.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.785
That's why we want to see
the files.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.050
Well, they should be
at the end of this row.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.965
Hey! Federal agent!

17:38.753 --> 17:41.147
Gonna need you to put
your hands on your head

17:41.190 --> 17:42.235
and back towards me.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.759
Hey!

17:47.631 --> 17:48.589
Maggie!

17:48.632 --> 17:50.025
Janey, go after him.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.592
I'm not leaving you.
You're hurt.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.768
No, it's... it's just a scratch.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.031
Take it easy.
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
- Janey,

17:56.075 --> 17:57.641
he dropped this.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.558
Didn't get a look at him,
did you?
No.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.125
But I got a few scratches in.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.127
Enough to pull DNA
off our attacker?

18:13.614 --> 18:16.225
- Does it hurt?
- Eh. It's not the first time

18:16.269 --> 18:18.140
I got my bell rung, kiddo.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.533
You should see
the other guy.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.317
And you should
leave work at work.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.014
Ah, yeah.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.973
Jules,
how's the project coming along?

18:28.498 --> 18:31.197
Mom, has anybody asked

18:31.240 --> 18:34.025
if you're really American?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.639
Of course not.

18:39.466 --> 18:42.643
A lot of people were asked that
after Pearl Harbor.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.253
That was a long time ago.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.126
But they're still
being asked that today, right?

18:50.825 --> 18:52.653
Why don't you go do the dishes?

18:52.696 --> 18:54.916
I got to talk to your brother.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.271
She asked me about it--

19:02.315 --> 19:04.534
Executive Order 9066,

19:04.578 --> 19:06.101
loyalty tests.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.495
Before you got home,
she asked me what a "Jap" was.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.018
Don't use that word.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.499
- Aunt Maggie, back me up.
Aunt Maggie is gone.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.414
Aunt Switzerland
has taken her place.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.199
She's ten years old.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.070
She doesn't need to be exposed
to this yet.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.551
She's already exposed.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.423
We can't just...

19:23.466 --> 19:26.339
ignore who we are.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.732
No matter how young.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.525
<i>Has</i> anybody asked you?

19:39.395 --> 19:41.528
You know the answer to that.

19:41.571 --> 19:44.226
Then why can't Julie?

19:44.270 --> 19:46.489
It either comes
from you,

19:46.533 --> 19:49.144
or it comes from the world.

19:49.188 --> 19:53.627
And the world, sweet Janey,
is a cruel teacher.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.807
Worked with campus police to try
to ID Maggie's attacker.

19:59.850 --> 20:03.941
No witnesses, no usable
security footage, no leads.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.770
Other than some skin samples
that might get us a suspect.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.599
And the fact that the suspect

20:09.643 --> 20:11.601
information on Ken Ito.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.299
Or whoever he is.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.387
Could be someone

20:14.430 --> 20:15.736
close to Ito,

20:15.779 --> 20:17.128
- trying to protect his secret.
- Someone's trying

20:17.172 --> 20:18.608
to bury the truth.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.654
Except Tennant
might have found it for us.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.351
A photo from
the archives.

20:22.395 --> 20:26.007
Time stamp puts it August 1941,
which lines up with the harvest.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.488
Corroborates the story
about the pineapple fields.

20:28.531 --> 20:29.619
Do we know who these guys are?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.099
The ones in uniform.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.275
I built a machine
learning algorithm

20:33.319 --> 20:34.624
that narrowed searches
based on

20:34.668 --> 20:36.191
things like
military citations,

20:36.235 --> 20:39.368
UH affiliation and War
Relocation Authority records.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.370
Ito is on the far left.

20:41.414 --> 20:44.025
The two next to him were sent
to camps on the mainland.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.983
The third joined
the 100th Battalion

20:46.027 --> 20:48.508
and the 442nd Regiment
but was killed in action.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.074
And the civilian?

20:50.901 --> 20:52.120
Alas...

20:52.163 --> 20:53.861
my machine is still learning.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.210
Another dead end.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.212
Well, we might not know
who he was,

20:57.256 --> 21:00.389
but I think
I can tell you who he is.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.139
- That's the
current Ken Ito.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.839
Hey, I ask about you, right?

21:15.883 --> 21:16.797
Like your...

21:16.840 --> 21:19.103
family, your life?

21:19.147 --> 21:21.802
Even know
Jake's favorite Pokémon.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.282
Raichu.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.284
Yeah, 'cause why wouldn't
you evolve your Pikachu?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.981
I agree with him.
It's just dumb.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.330
No idea what that means.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.331
Someone said

21:29.375 --> 21:31.638
I don't ask about
them, and...

21:31.681 --> 21:33.770
I'm wondering why.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.903
It isn't Lloyd
from Fraud, is it?

21:35.946 --> 21:38.253
Because he's very guarded,
for obvious reasons.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.735
No, not Lloyd.
Just... someone.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.650
Well, I might be
out over my skis,

21:43.693 --> 21:46.348
but I think you're talking
about intimacy, Luce.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.046
So if somebody wants you
to get to know them,

21:49.090 --> 21:50.918
get to know them.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.878
Sir, we're with... NCIS.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.880
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Mike Ito.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.360
- Ah, his grandson.
- Do you know

21:58.404 --> 21:59.535
how many lines you've crossed?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.668
As upsetting
as this might be to you,

22:01.711 --> 22:03.017
we're within our jurisdiction.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.018
Moral lines.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.149
The sooner we can do our jobs...

22:05.193 --> 22:06.368
You're harassing a hero.

22:06.412 --> 22:07.500
...the sooner we can
get out of your lives.

22:07.543 --> 22:08.762
- A man with dementia.
- There's...

22:08.805 --> 22:11.330
reason to believe
that your grandfather

22:11.373 --> 22:13.027
isn't who he says he is.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.334
A decorated combat veteran?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.118
An icon in the immigrant
rights movement?

22:17.161 --> 22:19.033
Which accomplishment
do you question?

22:26.736 --> 22:28.390
A letter

22:28.434 --> 22:30.523
signed by four retired admirals,
two congresspeople

22:30.566 --> 22:34.396
and ten state representatives,
all vouching for my grandfather.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.267
Who is that?

22:36.311 --> 22:38.705
<i>Jiichan,
don't bother.</i>

22:38.748 --> 22:40.924
Let them in.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.281
You recognize this man,
don't you?

22:51.805 --> 22:54.373
Ensign Ken Ito.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.766
And is that you?

22:57.593 --> 22:59.160
No.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.555
<i>Jiichan...</i>

23:02.598 --> 23:03.556
what are you saying?

23:03.599 --> 23:04.905
It's not me.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.254
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

23:06.297 --> 23:09.039
Do you know what happened
to Ken Ito?

23:09.823 --> 23:12.913
Uh, we were fishing.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.394
<i>Kerie-na.</i>

23:15.437 --> 23:17.787
It really is beautiful.

23:17.831 --> 23:20.486
But how is your accent
still this terrible?

23:20.529 --> 23:22.444
Because it's
way too early.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.100
It was you and Ito on the boat?

23:26.143 --> 23:29.451
The day it all went wrong.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.453
- What are you doing?
- I can't stay here!

23:31.497 --> 23:33.499
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't try to stop me!

23:36.458 --> 23:37.894
What happened next?

23:43.030 --> 23:44.597
Sir?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.512
What are you telling us?

23:46.555 --> 23:48.862
He-he tried to stop me.

23:48.905 --> 23:50.080
Stop you from doing what?

23:50.124 --> 23:52.474
- This needs to end.
- Sir...

23:52.518 --> 23:55.259
did you kill Ken Ito?

23:59.829 --> 24:01.875
Yes. I...

24:01.918 --> 24:04.399
I killed Ken Ito.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.106
Not looking
happy, boss.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.979
Just came from a very
important meeting with SECNAV.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.546
They want to know
if we arrest Ken Ito,

24:20.589 --> 24:22.069
we can do it discreetly.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.071
So we don't interfere
with the Pearl Harbor ceremony.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.115
Can we?

24:25.159 --> 24:26.116
Not yet.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.291
We have a confession.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.597
What we have is
reasonable suspicion.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.164
He admitted to killing

24:30.207 --> 24:31.600
the real Ken Ito.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.646
With no details or context.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.083
"I killed Ken Ito."
Direct quote.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.214
From someone with dementia.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.694
He had motive.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.436
Asian Exclusion Act of 1924.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.439
Japanese weren't allowed
to immigrate to the U.S.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.528
He was in the country illegally.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.008
So you think
the real Ken Ito

24:48.051 --> 24:49.444
was gonna turn him in?

24:49.488 --> 24:52.491
And our guy killed him,
took over his life.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.015
No, there's something more.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.451
Someone wants intel on Ito.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.453
Assaulted my friend
to try to get it.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.021
But we still don't know
who or why.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.152
There are two mistakes

25:02.196 --> 25:04.415
a person makes
on the road to truth.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.244
Not starting--
which we've already done.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.203
And not going all
the way. So...

25:09.246 --> 25:11.466
who can our archive attacker be?

25:11.510 --> 25:14.556
Family members
- trying to bury the truth?
- Mm,

25:14.600 --> 25:15.818
unlikely.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.037
Both Mike and Vicky Ito
were at home

25:17.080 --> 25:18.299
when the attacks happened.

25:18.342 --> 25:19.648
They could've paid someone
to do it.

25:19.692 --> 25:20.954
Getting warm, Lucy.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.825
'Cause money does
play into this.

25:22.869 --> 25:26.002
I dug into Ken Ito's
personal finances.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.614
All very conservative.
Decent nest egg.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.833
Until...

25:32.269 --> 25:34.924
A hundred thousand
dollar transfer.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.884
In the last 24 hours, and it
just evaporated into the ether.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.495
Not for medical care
or investments

25:40.539 --> 25:41.757
or a sweet campervan.

25:41.801 --> 25:42.758
He could've
paid someone

25:42.802 --> 25:43.977
to go to the archive.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.718
Or paid them off to keep quiet.

25:45.761 --> 25:46.980
Blackmail.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.938
Whatever our suspect got
from the archives

25:48.982 --> 25:50.592
could be the evidence we need.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.594
Where are we at
with the DNA Maggie got

25:52.638 --> 25:53.769
from the scratches?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.423
That's not my department,
unfortunately.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.512
Can you check in with Chase?
Look into

25:57.556 --> 25:59.732
any suspicious contacts
with the Itos.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.951
Lot of eyes on this, guys.
They want this resolved

26:01.995 --> 26:04.127
one way or another
before the ceremony tomorrow.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.651
Okay.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.270
What's up?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.578
There's no way
they're gonna let Ito stand up

26:19.621 --> 26:21.101
at that ceremony, is there?

26:21.144 --> 26:22.798
He's already off the list.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.368
You all right?

26:27.411 --> 26:32.155
If all this is true, it means
this man left everything behind,

26:32.199 --> 26:35.594
and he served his entire life
to get what most people just...

26:35.637 --> 26:37.160
have.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.380
But maybe murdered someone
to do it.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.251
Yeah, but you don't believe
that's true.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.517
It reminds me of something
Julie said last night.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.868
She wondered
if anybody asked me

26:48.911 --> 26:50.783
if I was really American.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.175
How'd you answer?

26:52.219 --> 26:54.525
I didn't.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.010
It was my first time
on the mainland,

27:01.054 --> 27:02.446
and I was

27:02.490 --> 27:03.926
18 years old.

27:03.970 --> 27:07.756
I was hanging out off base
when someone drove by

27:07.800 --> 27:11.673
and they yelled at me,
"Go back home to Mexico."

27:11.717 --> 27:14.197
To Mexico.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.983
It's different on the island,
you know?

27:17.026 --> 27:19.986
So it was, like,
the first time I felt that,

27:20.029 --> 27:21.640
and...

27:21.683 --> 27:23.990
I don't know, I sort of wish
someone prepared me for it,

27:24.033 --> 27:27.471
because I don't remember
laughing it off so easily then.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.651
Found our blackmailer.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.217
Ito's caretaker.

27:34.261 --> 27:36.176
Ryan Barnett.
Had a felony DUI

27:36.219 --> 27:37.656
that was reduced
to a misdemeanor,

27:37.699 --> 27:39.483
but his DNA is
still in CODIS.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.311
Also wasn't at
the house today.

27:41.355 --> 27:42.835
Lying low
after the archives.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.489
- Where is he now?
- Ernie has a bead
on his cell phone GPS.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.665
Go get him.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.676
This is Barnett's vehicle.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.680
- His phone's inside.
- Yeah? So where is he?

28:01.723 --> 28:03.682
The main branch of the
Honolulu National Bank

28:03.725 --> 28:04.683
is across the street.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.207
There he is.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.907
He's not coming back to his car.

28:11.951 --> 28:15.171
He's got a backup
vehicle. Clever.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.875
Ryan Barnett,

28:22.918 --> 28:24.703
NCIS. We need to talk.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.444
Hey, relax, okay?
Don't make this hard.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.099
He's making it hard.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.231
Just give up, dude.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.667
There's no way out.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.631
Hands!

28:41.458 --> 28:43.722
You guys didn't want
to follow him?

28:47.247 --> 28:48.378
Remember me?

28:48.422 --> 28:50.554
I've never seen you before.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.121
Then where'd you get those?

28:52.165 --> 28:53.470
We pulled DNA

28:53.514 --> 28:55.081
from those scratches.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.083
They put you at the UH archives,

28:57.126 --> 28:59.563
where you stole Ken Ito's files.

28:59.607 --> 29:00.782
That's burglary.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.394
You hurt my friend.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.961
That's assault.

29:06.005 --> 29:07.571
Then you demanded

29:07.615 --> 29:09.835
a hundred thousand dollars
from the Itos.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.532
That's blackmail.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.403
Okay, look,
I'm not the bad guy here.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.362
Ito isn't who
he says he is.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.190
It's not really your business.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.018
You don't understand
what he's done.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.672
Considering my entire team
is investigating him,

29:21.716 --> 29:23.152
I'd say we do.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.285
No, not about his identity.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.678
About his treason.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.204
He's a war criminal.

29:31.247 --> 29:32.901
And I can prove
it, but...

29:32.945 --> 29:34.424
I want immunity.

29:34.468 --> 29:35.774
You're negotiating now?

29:35.817 --> 29:37.427
You should be thanking me
for outing him.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.561
But you didn't out him.
You extorted him.

29:40.604 --> 29:41.780
Look...

29:41.823 --> 29:44.783
I used to idolize Ito.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.960
Until I figured out he was
an imposter.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.788
He would tell us
these stories

29:49.831 --> 29:52.355
about the war,
about who he really was,

29:52.399 --> 29:54.270
and so I started
recording.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.229
And then when you
guys showed up, I...

29:56.272 --> 29:57.796
I knew I was right.

29:57.839 --> 30:00.102
And you tried to cash out
before we got to the truth?

30:00.146 --> 30:02.278
Stuff in those archives proved

30:02.322 --> 30:05.629
that he was a
Japanese spy.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.631
If I don't help you guys
figure this out...

30:07.675 --> 30:11.374
Then Ito goes free, and you've
just blackmailed a war hero.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.290
Try again, Ryan.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.771
Where are the recordings?

30:18.033 --> 30:20.470
This is a recording Ryan Barnett
took of Ken Ito,

30:20.514 --> 30:22.646
or whoever he is, two weeks ago.

30:22.690 --> 30:26.128
But I'm telling you,
you won't like this.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.782
Just hit "play."

30:36.095 --> 30:38.227
That's Japanese.
What's he saying?

30:38.271 --> 30:39.750
He fought
with the Japanese

30:39.794 --> 30:41.665
- in Burma.
He switches
to English here.

30:41.709 --> 30:45.191
- Mr. Ito, in English, please.
- I was a spy.

30:45.234 --> 30:48.411
During the war,
I went to the Japanese

30:48.455 --> 30:52.676
and fed them intel
on American troop positions.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.986
<i>Until the day we were ambushed.</i>

31:18.441 --> 31:21.749
<i>I don't know
how I survived that day.</i>

31:23.925 --> 31:26.754
Ito wasn't the hero
we all think he was.

31:26.797 --> 31:29.800
He was a spy for the Japanese.

31:31.411 --> 31:34.718
Told you...
you wouldn't like it.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.339
Come in.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.306
Did you know?

31:57.350 --> 32:00.962
Sometimes my father would see
something on TV, and...

32:01.006 --> 32:03.617
tell us the story
like it was his own.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.011
But you had to have suspected
something.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.534
If not,

32:07.577 --> 32:08.622
you don't pay the blackmailer.

32:08.665 --> 32:10.972
I found my father
one day

32:11.016 --> 32:12.582
crying out for his mother

32:12.626 --> 32:15.846
after he almost drowned
in Kanamarugawa.

32:15.890 --> 32:16.978
He had alwaystold us

32:17.022 --> 32:18.675
he was born and raised in Utah.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.329
So is it
the truth,

32:20.373 --> 32:22.331
or is it fantasy?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.725
You didn't want to risk it.

32:25.856 --> 32:26.988
You can't ask me to let it be.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.555
Even if I
wanted to.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.513
We're asking you to keep going.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.994
My father's opened up
about his past.

32:33.038 --> 32:36.128
Even before he was sick,
he never talked about the war.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.521
Something's jogging
his memory.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.959
Find out
who my father really is.

32:41.002 --> 32:45.050
We'll face the truth
as a family.

32:50.925 --> 32:54.363
Officials say he
served on staff

32:54.407 --> 32:56.235
in the Atlantic Fleet.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.367
But there's a blank spot

32:58.411 --> 33:00.282
between '42and '44.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.197
I find it hard to believe
he managed to work

33:02.241 --> 33:05.200
for the Japanese, get captured,
and end up in Europe.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.985
- We've looked
into POW records

33:07.028 --> 33:10.510
from World War II,
but we couldn't find Ken Ito.

33:10.553 --> 33:14.209
Except for a reference

33:14.253 --> 33:15.732
<i>Gosei.</i>

33:15.776 --> 33:18.170
Can you access those records?

33:20.172 --> 33:23.044
I might know someone
who could help.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.741
Hey, uh...

33:24.785 --> 33:26.830
...really can't
thank you enough.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.615
All evidence
to the contrary.

33:28.658 --> 33:31.487
You've been thanking me
for the last 20 minutes.

33:32.488 --> 33:33.620
Oh. Sorry.

33:33.663 --> 33:36.057
And apologizing.
It's not a personal favor.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.538
Your boss went
through proper channels.

33:38.581 --> 33:41.976
I want to be intimate.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.109
Here?

33:44.152 --> 33:46.372
No, not like...
No. Um...

33:46.415 --> 33:49.027
I mean, I... I haven't
taken the time

33:49.070 --> 33:51.507
to really get to know you.

33:51.551 --> 33:54.032
So... I kind of did.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.773
As in... spying on me?

33:56.817 --> 33:58.253
As in googling.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.864
What'd you find out?

34:00.908 --> 34:02.953
Well, it wasn't about you,
exactly.

34:06.435 --> 34:09.395
Ambush in Taji, Iraq, 2009.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.137
There were three
casualties,

34:12.180 --> 34:13.486
including...

34:13.529 --> 34:15.401
Captain Noah Whistler.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.881
His younger
sister was

34:17.925 --> 34:20.449
at Northwestern at the time.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.670
Rush chair for Tri Delt.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.412
I was a Theta.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.896
I bet he was a great guy.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.725
He was.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.426
So, should I... google you, too?

34:40.469 --> 34:41.775
Like you haven't already.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.692
Okay, um,
here are your files.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.259
Uh...

34:47.302 --> 34:49.043
declassified and sent
to the Base Historians Office

34:49.087 --> 34:50.566
years ago.

34:50.610 --> 34:52.046
Look at this.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.483
Operation <i>Gosei.</i>

34:57.138 --> 34:59.271
These are OSS records.
What's that?

34:59.314 --> 35:01.838
Precursor to the CIA.

35:01.882 --> 35:04.232
"Ambush in Burma."
There we go.

35:04.276 --> 35:07.279
It should say that Ito
was taken as a POW.

35:08.193 --> 35:11.152
No, there were no POWs
taken that day.

35:11.196 --> 35:14.634
Only an American operative.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.769
Suzuki Kazutoshi?

35:24.122 --> 35:26.515
Born in Fukuoka.

35:26.559 --> 35:29.301
Stowed away to the United States
at ten years old.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.216
Worked in the pineapple fields.

35:31.259 --> 35:34.349
Until you met
a Japanese American ensign...

35:34.393 --> 35:36.438
Ken Ito.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.788
He was one of William Donovan's
first officers

35:38.832 --> 35:42.314
in what would eventually become
the OSS.

35:42.357 --> 35:45.360
And he recruited you
for Operation <i>Gosei.</i>

35:45.404 --> 35:47.014
The U.S. sent
Japanese Americans

35:47.057 --> 35:48.842
to embed
in the Imperial Army.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.713
You <i>were</i> a spy.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.585
But not for the Japanese.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.283
The mission in Burma--
you weren't leading

35:55.327 --> 35:59.157
the Japanese in an attack,
you led them to an ambush.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.159
Your service
is undeniable.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.204
But we need to know...

36:03.248 --> 36:06.555
did you murder the real Ken Ito?

36:08.253 --> 36:11.473
W-We just wanted to go fishing.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.173
Grab the other side of the net,
will you?

36:15.216 --> 36:17.523
Oh, and pliers.
They're in the tackle box.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.835
<i>Nanda kore?</i>

36:25.879 --> 36:27.228
It's for the fish.

36:32.059 --> 36:34.192
Or people who scuff up my shoes.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.541
What's with the uniform?

36:35.584 --> 36:37.847
- Technically, I'm off duty.
- Then technically,

36:37.891 --> 36:39.066
you're showing off.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.502
Just help me toss the net over.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.512
<i>Kirei-na.</i>

36:50.556 --> 36:52.340
It really is beautiful.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.212
But how is your accent
still this terrible?

36:54.255 --> 36:55.996
Because it's
way too early.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.348
It's an attack.

37:07.703 --> 37:08.748
Hold on.

37:08.791 --> 37:09.966
<i>Hayaku.</i> We need to help.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.099
I will. As soon as
I get you to safety.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.624
What are you doing?

37:15.668 --> 37:16.930
I can't stay here.

37:16.973 --> 37:18.801
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't try to stop me!

37:21.848 --> 37:23.066
This isn't your fight.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.503
Let me prove myself!

37:29.072 --> 37:30.900
Ito!

37:51.747 --> 37:53.401
Ito?

37:59.973 --> 38:01.714
Ito!

38:03.193 --> 38:05.413
We were on the windward side

38:05.457 --> 38:08.503
in the flight path
of the Japanese Zeroes.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.549
Is that when the switch
happened?

38:10.592 --> 38:11.680
The Coast Guard

38:11.724 --> 38:14.248
found me on his boat
with his effects.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.947
They thought I was Ken Ito.

38:17.991 --> 38:21.603
And... I took the chance.

38:21.647 --> 38:23.301
For the life you wanted.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.477
From that day on, you were him.

38:26.652 --> 38:29.045
- No one else figured it out?
- My handler

38:29.089 --> 38:30.917
at the OSS.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.136
Pretending to be Ken Ito

38:33.180 --> 38:35.443
made me a better spy,

38:35.487 --> 38:38.098
so they made it official.

38:38.141 --> 38:41.754
After Burma, they
transferred me back

38:41.797 --> 38:43.321
to the Navy.

38:43.364 --> 38:46.367
Why did you say
you killed Ken Ito?

38:46.411 --> 38:48.064
In a way, I did.

38:48.108 --> 38:49.631
I took his life.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.503
I hope...

38:51.546 --> 38:54.593
it's a life he'd be proud of.

38:54.636 --> 38:58.466
And now I'm willing to accept
the consequences.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.472
There are no consequences, sir.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.474
Not from us.

39:06.518 --> 39:07.997
And seeing how the
change in identity

39:08.041 --> 39:12.350
was sanctioned by the OSS,

39:12.393 --> 39:14.656
this case is closed.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.186
Okay. I tried.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.407
How do we look,
Mama?

39:26.451 --> 39:28.496
Perfect.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.760
Hey, sit down for a minute.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.154
Here comes the speech.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.342
When I was 16,

39:48.386 --> 39:51.998
Grandpa was stationed
in a place where...

39:52.041 --> 39:55.001
I didn't look
like everybody else.

39:56.350 --> 40:00.441
People would ask me,
where was I <i>really</i> from?

40:00.485 --> 40:03.052
I said I was American.

40:04.924 --> 40:08.057
But some didn't see it that way.

40:10.364 --> 40:14.063
And others didn't like
that I was different.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.024
Eventually...

40:18.067 --> 40:20.287
neither did I.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.944
So I lied.

40:24.987 --> 40:29.470
I said I didn't really know
where my mom's family was from.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.821
And I hid stuff about myself.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.476
Why?

40:35.520 --> 40:38.740
Because I didn't think
being myself was good enough.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.527
Doesn't it make you mad?

40:46.966 --> 40:49.925
That someday something like this

40:49.969 --> 40:53.059
might happen to you, too?

40:53.102 --> 40:55.148
Yeah.

40:56.715 --> 41:00.675
People shouldn't have to pretend
to be somebody they're not.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.703
Please be seated.

41:32.707 --> 41:36.972
By the way, which hero
did Julie pick for her project?

41:37.756 --> 41:39.975
You.

41:40.759 --> 41:42.543
80 years later,

41:42.587 --> 41:44.284
Pearl Harbor has
an Asian American

41:44.327 --> 41:45.938
Special Agent in Charge.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.548
Told her it was a
loose interpretation

41:47.592 --> 41:48.941
of the assignment.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.117
Now welcome to the stage,

41:51.160 --> 41:53.206
one of the last
remaining survivors

41:53.249 --> 41:56.209
of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

42:02.955 --> 42:05.305
My name is...

42:05.348 --> 42:08.917
Suzuki Kazutoshi.

42:08.961 --> 42:13.356
And it has been the honor
of a lifetime

42:13.400 --> 42:15.271
to serve this country.
