WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.754
Lily, I just saw
the worst thing ever!

00:03.754 --> 00:05.339
Kind of busy
right now, Marshall.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.590
Quiet.
He can hear you.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.674
Who's "he"?

00:07.758 --> 00:09.468
He's coming!
Everyone shut up!

00:09.468 --> 00:11.303
<i>Okay, kids,
you're probably wondering how</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:12.679
<i>we all got here.</i>

00:12.763 --> 00:15.098
Oh, hey, buddy, can we borrow
your air mattress?

00:15.182 --> 00:16.683
My mom's coming into
town for a few days.

00:16.767 --> 00:17.976
Absolutely not.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.187
Bummer, I guess
she can't stay with us.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.105
Hey, look,
what I just found.

00:22.189 --> 00:26.068
A list of hotels and other
creative housing options.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.570
Baby, my mom is not
staying at a hotel.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.949
Or our storage unit.
Why can't we borrow your air mattress?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.784
Because when you animals
borrow things,

00:33.784 --> 00:34.993
you never return them.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.537
That's ridiculous.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.622
No, my Cleveland, Ohio,
Chamber of Commerce

00:38.622 --> 00:41.041
mini-cooler
is ridiculous.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.543
Ridiculous at keeping
stuff cold

00:42.543 --> 00:45.337
while also promoting Ohio's
second-largest rubber producer.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.089
Watch your back, Akron.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.424
I totally gave that back.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.844
And what about that
"Vote For Ted" hoodie

00:51.844 --> 00:54.596
from when I ran for treasurer
in high school?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.681
Mrs. Gooding said

00:55.681 --> 00:59.768
my concession speech was,
"full of grace."

00:59.852 --> 01:02.229
I don't recall
borrowing that.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.357
And whatever happened
to my limited edition DVD

01:05.357 --> 01:07.860
of the classic 1989
Silverman-McCarthy romp,

01:07.860 --> 01:12.197
Weekend at Bernie's,
"borrowed" well over six months ago?

01:12.281 --> 01:13.323
Yeah, I'm keeping that.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.158
Those extra features
are awesome.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.827
I mean, that making-of
documentary?

01:16.827 --> 01:19.872
"How Bernie Avoided The Gurney:
A Cinematic Journey."

01:19.872 --> 01:22.916
Look, I'm just tired
of people borrowing things

01:23.000 --> 01:24.042
and never returning them.

01:24.126 --> 01:27.713
If you don't believe me,
ask my ex-friend Stuart.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.548
Ted, I gave your red
cowboy boots back

01:29.548 --> 01:31.717
the day after Halloween.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.178
How could you lie to me
right to my face, Stuart?

01:34.178 --> 01:38.098
You are a horrible
human being.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.851
Congrats on
your daughter's christening.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.439
And where's the worst abuser
of my generosity, Barney?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.609
Or should I say,
"Borrow-ney"?

01:48.609 --> 01:49.693
You should
never say that.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.361
And I think he's out
with Patrice.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.322
Uch, Patrice?
That's still happening?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.823
<i>Kids, you remember Patrice.</i>

01:54.907 --> 01:56.325
<i>She worked
with your Aunt Robin.</i>

01:56.325 --> 01:59.077
Robin! You left your purse
at the vending machine,

01:59.161 --> 02:00.746
and some guy tried
to steal it!

02:00.746 --> 02:04.291
I fought him off, but I think
I dislocated my shoulder.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.545
You scratched the leather! Oh!

02:08.629 --> 02:10.964
Can't you do anything right,
Patrice?

02:11.048 --> 02:14.051
That Barney-and-Patrice
thing is so bogus.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.594
He's clearly trying
to get back at me

02:15.594 --> 02:16.887
for rejecting him.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.348
Um, Robin, after you
rejected Barney,

02:19.348 --> 02:21.225
didn't he reject you?

02:21.225 --> 02:23.227
And didn't you go over to his place
and try to sleep with him

02:23.227 --> 02:25.062
in your purple-and-
black underwear?

02:25.062 --> 02:26.897
Hey, uh, Lil, feel free
to disregard that

02:26.897 --> 02:30.067
"Don't tell anyone
about this ever" thing.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.443
She has your
mini-cooler.

02:31.527 --> 02:32.694
I knew it!

02:32.778 --> 02:33.987
But seriously,
what other reason would

02:34.071 --> 02:35.572
Barney have to date Patrice?

02:35.656 --> 02:36.949
It's an over-correction.

02:36.949 --> 02:40.035
How dare you?
What is that?

02:40.035 --> 02:43.413
Barney was engaged to Quinn,
a stripper he never really trusted.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.832
So he overcorrects
by dating her opposite:

02:45.916 --> 02:47.793
warm and nurturing Patrice.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.169
That does happen, like Ted.

02:49.253 --> 02:52.589
After you broke up
with sweet innocent Victoria.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.466
No, you hang up first.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.010
No, you hang up first.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.428
Hang up,
you little bitch!

03:00.222 --> 03:01.682
Over-correction.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.350
Yeah. And it's not just relationships.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.227
Remember when that comedy club
owner told Marshall

03:05.227 --> 03:07.104
that his "funny fish names"
stand-up act

03:07.104 --> 03:08.313
didn't have enough edge?

03:08.397 --> 03:12.109
Flounder?
I barely know her! Oh!

03:13.402 --> 03:15.195
Over-correction.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.614
Although it was better
than his Chris Rock rip-off.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.742
A trout with a daughter
has one job.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.036
One job!

03:23.120 --> 03:26.290
To keep her off
the fishing pole!

03:26.290 --> 03:29.042
You suck!

03:29.126 --> 03:31.211
Lily!

03:44.641 --> 03:46.476
I'm a little worried about Ted.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.148
I mean, we're parents now,
and even Barney is moving on.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.443
I just wish he had
someone to talk to.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.986
Even for a week.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.988
Or you know, four days,
three nights.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.448
My mom is not staying with Ted!

03:59.448 --> 04:01.408
He'd love her bacon-
gummy bear pancakes.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.953
I'm her special boy,
I get her special pancakes.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.331
But my dad is here
nannying all the time.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.749
Then add your mom in?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.084
This place is crowded
enough already.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.920
Hey, Lil,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.755
let me know
how the pump's working.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.173
I cleaned it for you.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.674
It's fine, Dad.
Yeah, I had

04:17.758 --> 04:21.053
to check the suction,
so I tested it on myself.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.262
Oh, no.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.681
Don't worry, the suction's fine,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.266
actually kind of nice.

04:28.894 --> 04:32.564
Okay, Barney is so not
for real about Patrice.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.066
Today he did the craziest,

04:34.066 --> 04:37.110
most clearly staged
for my benefit thing ever.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.445
Hey, Patrice,
you ready for lunch?

04:38.529 --> 04:39.530
Sure.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.950
Right, right?

04:42.950 --> 04:47.329
I mean,
what's next, birthday gifts?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.873
Wake up, people, this is
not an overcorrection,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.291
it's fraud, and we need

04:51.375 --> 04:53.377
to keep trying to stop this.

04:53.377 --> 04:56.296
What do you mean,
"keep trying"?

04:56.380 --> 04:58.590
Barney is not
who you think he is.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.675
What do you mean?

04:59.675 --> 05:01.552
Well, he has a book
of plays he uses

05:01.552 --> 05:03.595
to trick women
into sleeping with him.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.723
Oh, no way,
Barney's my honey bear.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.725
Actually, one of his plays
is called The Honey Bear.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.102
He dresses up
like Winnie the Pooh,

05:10.102 --> 05:12.396
and the next thing you know,
his hand's stuck in your pot.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.566
Robin, you're a doll
for worrying about me,

05:15.566 --> 05:17.943
but that doesn't sound at all
like my Barney.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.654
Why won't you let me
help you, Patrice!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.409
She can't see
that Barney is using her,

05:25.409 --> 05:27.744
and it breaks my heart.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.955
You know, I-I-I love Patrice.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.623
We're like sisters.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.041
You've never gotten
through even one exchange

05:33.125 --> 05:34.334
without screaming at her.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.920
Sisters fight, Ted!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.046
But the bond

05:38.130 --> 05:40.048
is always there.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.133
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.428
And that's why I need to steal
The Playbook and show it to Patrice,

05:44.428 --> 05:46.221
so she'll believe me.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.641
Or you could do
almost anything else

05:49.725 --> 05:51.643
and not sound so creepy.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.728
Robin,

05:52.728 --> 05:55.355
seriously, this obsession
isn't healthy.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.107
Just let it go.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.694
Maybe you guys are right.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.363
Thanks for talking
some sense into me.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.039
Lily, can I ask you a question?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.332
If it's "Did somebody put gravel

06:13.332 --> 06:15.125
in the couch cushions
you're sleeping on,"

06:15.209 --> 06:16.502
absolutely not.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.337
What would be the motive?

06:18.337 --> 06:19.630
No, it's not that.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.508
Uh, don't tell Marshall
because he's not ready,

06:22.508 --> 06:25.719
but I think I might want

06:25.719 --> 06:29.264
to get back out there
and meet a nice man.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.600
Wow, that's great, Judy.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.684
And I thought
you might be able to help

06:32.768 --> 06:34.603
because you always look
so good.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.480
You think I look good?

06:36.480 --> 06:39.024
I mean, you dress
like a Duluth streetwalker,

06:39.024 --> 06:41.902
but my son seems to like it.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.570
I'll take it.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.073
So, any advice?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.034
Well, first I'd throw out
any giant sweater

06:49.034 --> 06:50.160
with a horse on it.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.245
- Even the ones...
- Even the ones

06:51.245 --> 06:53.830
that have manes
with real horse hair, yes.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.000
And second, I'd let the gals
out to play a little more.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.127
The gals?

06:59.211 --> 07:01.421
Oh...

07:01.505 --> 07:04.216
you mean the Minnesota Twins.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.428
<i>Meanwhile,
Robin was about to give up</i>

07:08.512 --> 07:11.598
<i>on ever finding The Playbook until...</i>

07:18.397 --> 07:20.732
Ugh, the Bro Code, damn it.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.458
<i>David Lee Roth's autobiography?</i>

07:38.542 --> 07:40.544
Crap.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.171
"To the best wingman ever.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.380
We'll always have Panama.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.464
Love, Diamond Dave."

07:53.515 --> 07:56.185
Patrice, it's really nice of you
to buy Robin a new purse,

07:56.185 --> 07:58.520
but it's not your fault that
the other one got scratched.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.441
Anyway, just get
yourself over here.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.026
I've got the tree,
the decorations,

08:04.026 --> 08:05.485
and the know-how
from Lethal Weapon 2

08:05.569 --> 08:07.613
to pop that shoulder
right back into place.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.782
Yep, there is not one reason
to leave this apartment

08:10.866 --> 08:12.284
for even a second tonight.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.748
Ow.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.130
Hey, how's my favorite architect?
Other than incredibly handsome.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.215
Hey, Mom.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.716
No, it's Robin.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.092
What do you need?

08:29.176 --> 08:31.053
For reasons
that aren't important,

08:31.053 --> 08:32.471
I'm trapped in Barney's closet.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.015
Help get me out, and I'll return
your Weekend at Bernie's DVD.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.101
No way, that's not enough to get
me involved in your crazy mess.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.436
I'll also go with you

08:39.520 --> 08:41.563
to the five-day fan convention
in the desert.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.524
You'll come with me
to Bernie Man?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.983
Yes, just hurry.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.568
<i>Ooh...</i>

08:46.652 --> 08:50.239
<i>someone's excited to see me.</i>

08:50.239 --> 08:51.740
<i>Who's Mama's big boy?</i>

08:51.740 --> 08:54.952
<i>Who is Mama's big boy?</i>

08:57.162 --> 08:58.163
Wait.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.040
<i>I am.</i>

09:00.040 --> 09:01.124
Mickey?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.335
<i>And I've been bad.</i>

09:07.256 --> 09:09.174
Get off my mommy.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.146
Hugh Hefner
in your lobby right now.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.439
Oh, I'm gonna grab my robe.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.201
"Teddy's first Christmas"?

09:36.285 --> 09:38.036
Barney, are these my ornaments?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.330
That could be anyone's
baby handprint, Ted.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.041
Now, come on, Hef's old,
but he moves like a cheetah.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.693
Why would you do that...

10:09.693 --> 10:11.612
with Mickey?

10:11.612 --> 10:14.698
I've been lonely,
Marshall, and all the men

10:14.698 --> 10:19.786
in St. Cloud's idea of romance
is taking me ice fishing.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.455
That was me and
your father's thing.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.040
Plus,

10:23.040 --> 10:26.126
call it an overcorrection,
but it's kind of nice

10:26.210 --> 10:29.338
being with a sophisticated,
big-city man.

10:30.506 --> 10:33.050
You know, I don't know
what the big deal is.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.636
You've been bumping uglies
with my daughter for years.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.430
The second I climb up on your
mom, it's the end of the world?

10:41.016 --> 10:43.101
How could you think
that was Hef?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.478
It was
an honest mistake.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.605
That guy was black, Ted.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.982
I guess I just don't notice
that kind of stuff.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.665
We'll get to the grotto
one day, my pet.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.876
One day.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.044
How's my favorite architect?

11:09.044 --> 11:10.337
Other than well-endowed.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.630
Mom?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.298
No, it's Robin again.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.425
Look, you've got to come
back in and get my purse.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.553
Nope, I'm done. Bye, Robin.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.762
<i>Wait!</i>

11:18.846 --> 11:20.013
What if I told you
I was looking at

11:20.097 --> 11:21.765
your red cowboy boots right now?

11:23.267 --> 11:24.768
Describe them.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.186
They're red
and they're cowboy boots.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.479
That's them!

11:27.563 --> 11:28.814
Why are they at Barney's?

11:28.814 --> 11:30.899
Hey, Barney.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.985
Just returning Ted's boots
I borrowed for Halloween.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.695
You were a cowboy?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.321
No, my wife
was Wonder Woman.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.699
Can you believe Ted thinks a guy
can get laid wearing these?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.203
Challenge accepted.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.791
Do you know what
that sound is, Ted?

11:47.875 --> 11:48.876
That's a red boot

11:48.876 --> 11:51.587
about to be savagely
cut up by my pocketknife!

11:51.587 --> 11:52.880
You mean my pocketknife.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.257
I lent it to you two years ago.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.596
Hey.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.890
Sorry about the
Hugh Hefner mix-up.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.310
But seriously,
Jon Bon Jovi is downstairs.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.021
You sure it isn't my landlady,
Mrs. Takahashi?

12:09.021 --> 12:11.231
I'm serious.
The janitor just mopped the floor.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.108
Bon Jovi is literally
standing next to a sign

12:13.192 --> 12:14.443
that says "Slippery When Wet."

12:14.443 --> 12:17.529
Uh-uh.
I want those ornaments back.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.592
Damn it, Ted!

12:38.592 --> 12:40.344
You get those ornaments
all year.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.096
I just need
'em for Christmas!

12:43.180 --> 12:45.724
Oh. Hey, Patrice. Did you have
any trouble finding Rudolph?

12:45.724 --> 12:48.310
No, it was right on Ted's
fire escape like you said.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.312
Are you sure he's okay
with us borrowing it?

12:50.312 --> 12:51.480
Positive.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.527
- I got your purse.
- Oh, Ted,

12:56.527 --> 12:57.611
you're the best!

12:57.611 --> 12:59.279
But I'm trapped in Barney's
living room closet.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.948
Oh, Ted, you're the worst.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.032
Okay, enough messing around.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.283
I'm calling in The Wolf.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.868
- Lily?
- Lily.

13:13.377 --> 13:16.129
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

13:16.213 --> 13:17.798
Hold on, Marshall's calling me

13:17.798 --> 13:18.966
on the other

13:21.760 --> 13:24.096
line. Lily, I just saw
the worst thing ever.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.681
Kind of busy right
now, Marshall.

13:25.681 --> 13:26.849
Quiet. He can hear you.

13:26.849 --> 13:27.933
Who's "he"?

13:27.933 --> 13:29.977
He's coming!
Everyone shut up!

13:39.152 --> 13:41.822
I'm just gonna grab this star
to put on top of the tree.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.534
It's gonna be legend...
Wait for it...merry!

13:53.417 --> 13:56.086
What are you doing here, Lily?

13:56.170 --> 13:57.546
I've been using
Barney's apartment

13:57.546 --> 13:59.464
to pump milk for Marvin.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.757
What? Why?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.968
<i>Our apartment
is so crowded these days,</i>

14:02.968 --> 14:05.220
<i>I don't get a minute to myself!</i>

14:05.304 --> 14:06.680
<i>I have a key
to Barney's apartment,</i>

14:06.680 --> 14:08.056
<i>he has a kick-ass couch,</i>

14:08.140 --> 14:10.350
<i>and he DVR's
all the Real Housewives shows,</i>

14:10.434 --> 14:13.020
<i>including the reunion specials.</i>

14:23.322 --> 14:24.990
What are you doing here?

14:24.990 --> 14:26.116
I came to get The Playbook

14:26.200 --> 14:28.410
so I could show Patrice
who Barney really is.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.829
Why can't you just
let them be happy?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.539
Because they're not
really happy, Lily!

14:32.623 --> 14:34.499
Patrice, can you grab my
computer from the bedroom?

14:34.583 --> 14:37.044
I want to change my
Facebook status to "happy!"

14:38.170 --> 14:39.922
You shouldn't have that.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.174
You're right.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.976
What?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.061
Where is Ted?

14:54.061 --> 14:57.314
My label maker!

14:58.899 --> 15:00.943
No! I'm never coming out!

15:00.943 --> 15:04.446
You know, Marshall, you've been
in there for a while now.

15:04.530 --> 15:08.700
And I couldn't help but notice
you chugged that Super Big Gulp.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.827
It's not gonna work, Mickey.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.288
My bladder's
as big as your betrayal!

15:13.372 --> 15:15.666
I see. So it's not gonna
bother you to think

15:15.666 --> 15:20.212
about leaky faucets
or open hydrants,

15:20.212 --> 15:23.382
or rushing rivers, or...

15:23.382 --> 15:26.844
Oh, God, I got to pee. Oh!

15:26.844 --> 15:27.928
What is this?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.930
Where did you find that?

15:29.930 --> 15:31.682
I didn't want to believe
that this existed,

15:31.682 --> 15:33.851
but is this... The Playbook?

15:33.851 --> 15:36.645
Let's see him lie
his way out of this one.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.564
Yes, it is.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.148
These are

15:40.232 --> 15:41.692
all the tricks I used

15:41.692 --> 15:43.068
to get women to sleep with me.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.445
What do you
mean, tricks?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.073
Like...

15:48.073 --> 15:50.450
"The Two-Can-Play-at-That Game."

15:53.537 --> 15:54.538
Can I help you?

15:54.538 --> 15:57.624
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this, but...

15:57.708 --> 16:00.252
My wife is having an affair
with your husband.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.504
I even found a list
of every dirty way

16:02.588 --> 16:04.840
they've enjoyed
each other's bodies.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.552
I wish there was some way
we could get back at them.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.722
There is.

16:11.722 --> 16:14.224
We can kill them.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.692
I'm sorry to be the
one to tell you this...

16:23.692 --> 16:25.903
You're not who I thought you were.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.029
Patrice, I...

16:27.029 --> 16:28.822
I need some air.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.782
I...

16:30.866 --> 16:32.910
come on, Patrice, you...

16:32.910 --> 16:34.912
you have got to be kidding me.

16:40.209 --> 16:41.710
Wait. Is that my mini-cooler?

16:41.710 --> 16:43.921
Not now, Ted.
Let's go!

16:43.921 --> 16:46.006
Shh! Shh!

16:48.175 --> 16:50.177
Patrice, I have done

16:50.177 --> 16:53.514
some sleazy stuff to
seduce women, but

16:53.514 --> 16:54.723
I want to be a better person.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.351
You make me want to be
a better person.

16:57.351 --> 17:00.020
I can't be with a man
who has a playbook.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.648
I understand.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.201
Whoa.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.285
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

17:15.369 --> 17:16.828
Whoa!

17:16.912 --> 17:18.580
Is that my garbage can?

17:24.002 --> 17:26.088
I knew you were a keeper.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.172
Oh.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.390
I should go explain
this to the super.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.058
Hey, come with.
There's a small chance

17:38.058 --> 17:39.601
Jon Bon Jovi's
down in the lobby.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.353
"You Give Love a Bad Name"
is the first track

17:41.353 --> 17:42.729
on my "Get Psyched" mix!

17:42.813 --> 17:44.314
Mine, too!

17:51.363 --> 17:54.408
You still don't believe
those two are for real?

17:54.408 --> 17:55.993
I'll take that.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.453
The Ted Mosby Store
is officially closed.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.080
What spilled in here?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.332
Breast milk.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.293
Seriously, I give and give,

18:04.293 --> 18:07.546
and all I ask back
is a little bit of respect.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.596
Okay, so tonight got weird.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.264
You have no idea.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.267
My mom's apparently ready
to get back out there.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.227
Marshall, she told me
all about it,

18:22.311 --> 18:24.354
and I was happy to help.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.106
You helped? Why?

18:26.190 --> 18:28.859
I know it's hard to think of
your mom as a woman with needs,

18:28.859 --> 18:30.652
but you have to let
her get out there

18:30.736 --> 18:33.947
and rediscover her sexuality
with someone special.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.367
Oh, you don't know.

18:37.451 --> 18:40.287
No, uh, Marshall,
I do know.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.915
You just think it's gross
because it's your parent.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.750
But you know what?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.418
- It's beautiful.
- Mm.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.505
My mom

18:49.505 --> 18:52.382
and your dad are humping.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.262
I think you should be happy
for them.

18:57.346 --> 18:58.805
What? Why?

18:58.889 --> 19:00.390
What is good about this?

19:00.474 --> 19:02.726
Well, first of all,
respect to Mickey.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.895
Your mom's a piece.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.563
She's no Ted's mom,
but she's a piece.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.398
And secondly,

19:08.482 --> 19:11.985
I mean, it's nice
that they found each other.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.279
Sometimes you fall for someone
you'd never expect,

19:14.363 --> 19:16.365
but that doesn't make it wrong.

19:16.365 --> 19:19.451
Doesn't everyone deserve
to be happy?

19:19.535 --> 19:22.829
I guess none of us thought
of it that way.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.081
Next round's on me.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.210
Wow.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.545
I know.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.588
Barney's lost it.

19:31.672 --> 19:32.673
He needs an intervention.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.007
- Oh!
- Oh...

19:34.091 --> 19:36.635
Robin, after everything we've seen,

19:36.635 --> 19:39.429
do you still think
Barney's faking this?

19:39.513 --> 19:41.306
No, but we have to stop it.

19:41.390 --> 19:42.933
Barney is not Barney anymore.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.017
Well, people change.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.894
But not this fast
and this drastically.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.980
This is a cry for help, okay?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.816
If I was out of control,
I would want you guys to help me.

19:50.816 --> 19:53.610
So, what do you say? Intervention?

19:55.863 --> 19:57.614
Intervention.

19:57.698 --> 20:00.325
Oh, good. You're all here.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.202
Um, when Barney shows up,

20:02.286 --> 20:04.413
it's important for him
not to feel ganged up on,

20:04.413 --> 20:06.623
so, let's start with, um,

20:06.707 --> 20:08.876
"We love you,
and we're worried about you."

20:08.876 --> 20:12.045
We love you,
and we're worried about you.

20:12.129 --> 20:13.755
Oh. Great.

20:13.839 --> 20:16.175
But you know, with less pity
in your eyes.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.302
Sweetie, sit down.

20:18.302 --> 20:21.847
Uh, no. Only the person getting
the intervention sits down.

20:21.847 --> 20:25.142
Yeah.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.351
Oh.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.897
Please tell me
this is about my drinking.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.774
Damn it.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.365
So, we, um...
we just wanted to say

20:40.449 --> 20:44.411
that we're sorry for
the way that we acted

20:44.411 --> 20:47.206
when we found out
about you two.

20:48.207 --> 20:51.251
Your happiness
is what is most important,

20:51.335 --> 20:55.255
so, if you two want to date,
it's okay by us.

20:55.339 --> 20:57.007
Who said anything
about dating?

20:57.007 --> 20:59.510
This is just about sex.

20:59.510 --> 21:04.389
We're family...
with benefits.
