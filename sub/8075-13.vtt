WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:08.276
[music playing]

00:08.309 --> 00:10.678
It's beautiful--
more beautiful than

00:10.711 --> 00:12.146
I ever could have imagined.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.984
Nothing smells as sweet
as money you didn't earn.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.220
Ha ha.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.655
Yeah, why couldn't a
relative die every day.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.229
$382 for doing nothing.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.530
Now I know how Regis feels.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.136
You know, money really is
kind of like an aphrodisiac,

00:35.169 --> 00:36.370
isn't it?

00:36.404 --> 00:38.506
Come here big boy.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.509
Mmmm mmwa.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.043
I mean, it sure took
its time getting here.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.512
Your Aunt Harriet
died three months ago.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.879
Yeah.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.316
Well, when you die on a cruise
ship they pack you in buffet

00:48.349 --> 00:52.052
ice and just eat around you.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.187
I've got an idea.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.922
Let's get it in singles.
Throw it on the floor.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.056
Roll around in it--

00:56.090 --> 00:58.926
whatever I sticks we get
to spend on snow cones.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.294
I can't believe
you guys are actually

01:00.328 --> 01:02.430
celebrating someone's death.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.466
Hey, we're not
celebrating anybody's death.

01:05.499 --> 01:10.538
We're celebrating the fact
that we got $382 here.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.805
Her death was just a bonus.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.379
Hey, hold on there, Sparky.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.748
Aunt Harriet sent
you an envelope too.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.185
It's probably a bill for $382.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.086
Wow, $500.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.988
Ha ha ha--

01:28.021 --> 01:30.324
no, DJ, that's $5.

01:30.358 --> 01:34.895
It couldn't be-- it's $500.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.231
Why would she give DJ
more money than you guys?

01:37.265 --> 01:39.633
Well, actually it
makes perfect sense.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.169
DJ's the only
member of the family

01:41.202 --> 01:42.370
that Aunt Harriet never met.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.342
[music playing]

02:36.824 --> 02:40.361
Mrs. Conner just called from
the mall, where she's grieving.

02:40.394 --> 02:44.932
I've convinced her to
limit her grief to $230.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.901
That leaves us $150 for a
fancy meal at MacArthur's--

02:47.935 --> 02:50.838
7:00 reservations.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.573
OK.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.742
It's going to be
seven of us, so that

02:54.775 --> 02:59.447
comes out to $21.42 per person.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.748
Wait, wouldn't we
get more per person

03:00.781 --> 03:04.385
if somebody didn't
go, like David?

03:04.418 --> 03:06.287
Mrs. Conner wants
everyone to go, Mark.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.289
And if I was you, I wouldn't
bring up the subject

03:08.322 --> 03:11.058
of somebody not going.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.661
Look, everyone's going.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.296
There's plenty of
money for seven people

03:15.329 --> 03:18.266
to have a great meal.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.166
Surprise--

03:22.836 --> 03:25.473
Look, it's Darlene.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.407
Hey--

03:26.440 --> 03:31.512
Hey, what's that
you're wearing?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.413
Oh, it's the couch.

03:36.717 --> 03:41.121
Well, I'm sure you've
got big fancy plans

03:41.154 --> 03:43.791
to go out somewhere, starting
about, oh, say, 7 o'clock.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.925
So why don't you just take off?

03:44.958 --> 03:45.893
And I'll put your bag away.

03:45.926 --> 03:46.794
No.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.496
I'm all yours.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.697
I didn't make any plans.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.665
And I'm wearing shoes that
pinch to keep me awake.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.035
So what's for dinner?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.137
I'm starving.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.607
I don't know, but it's not
going to be as good as what

03:59.640 --> 04:03.411
we were having 30 seconds ago.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.446
Can you meet me in
the kitchen for a sec?

04:05.479 --> 04:06.347
How much?

04:06.380 --> 04:07.781
And when do you need it?

04:07.815 --> 04:11.352
Uhhhh, $100-- by Monday
night when I leave.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.120
Man, Darlene.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.423
Well, it's for
heat, and books,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.990
and that pesky heroin habit.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.795
Please-- look, I'll work for it.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.963
I'll do anything.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.332
OK.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.099
For a starts, you have to be
nice to everyone in the family

04:26.133 --> 04:27.034
the whole time you are here.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.235
Whoa, hold on a minute.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.070
When I said I do anything,
there was a whole lot

04:30.103 --> 04:32.005
of stuff not included in that.

04:32.039 --> 04:32.906
OK.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.043
Dad, we got it.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.912
All right, what do
we got to play with?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.214
$18.75 per person.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.750
Well, that sucks.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.318
You were just dangling
that good dinner

04:44.352 --> 04:46.420
right in front of me, just like
a carrot in front of a monkey.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.693
You know, I think I'm the
only person that can get off

04:52.726 --> 04:56.330
a crowded smelly bus and
remember that as the highlight

04:56.364 --> 04:58.499
of their visit home.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.801
[music playing]

05:03.771 --> 05:05.038
OK.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.975
Now remember, it's $18.75
each and that has to include

05:08.008 --> 05:09.943
your drinks and your dessert.

05:09.977 --> 05:15.749
And for your information,
market price means move on.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.150
You know, for such
a fancy restaurant,

05:17.184 --> 05:19.319
they really don't
have much of a menu.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.823
There's no jumbles--
nothing to color.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.559
Boy, look at all this stuff.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.395
I don't even know
where to start.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.863
Well, I'll simplify
it for you here.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.566
Appetizers are the
crackers we ate in the car

05:32.600 --> 05:35.403
on the way over here.

05:35.436 --> 05:39.106
And now pasta, you know,
that's just spaghetti.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.575
And I wouldn't pay
$12.95 for spaghetti

05:41.609 --> 05:46.880
if they had Mr. Chef Boyardee,
himself, in the kitchen there.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.550
I think I'll a--
go get the fish.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.686
I see what you're doing
there, Mark, ordering up

05:52.720 --> 05:55.689
the brain food, huh?

05:55.723 --> 05:56.990
Nice choice.

05:57.024 --> 05:57.858
Too bad it's too late.

06:01.395 --> 06:05.298
Well, I think I'm going to
have the king cut of prime rib

06:05.332 --> 06:07.435
and a Caesar salad.

06:07.468 --> 06:11.371
Can anyone tell dad
where he went wrong?

06:11.405 --> 06:13.507
Do you, Dan Conner,
take this woman--

06:16.744 --> 06:17.778
It's all right, Mr. Conner.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.146
You can have my share.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.681
I can't eat knowing
we only got this money

06:20.714 --> 06:21.515
because someone died.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.287
All right.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.757
We're back up to $21.42 each.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.825
[cheering]

06:33.293 --> 06:34.261
All right.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.497
David, you know
that fasting sure

06:36.530 --> 06:39.099
can be cleansing and spiritual.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.702
Anybody else, here, want
to join up with Gandhi so I

06:41.735 --> 06:42.903
can double up on the desserts?

06:46.474 --> 06:48.141
Hello, my name is Stan.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.245
I'll be your waiter
this evening.

06:55.783 --> 06:59.219
Oh my god-- it's you.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.991
Hey, it's Mr. Parkin.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.693
You guys know our waiter?

07:05.726 --> 07:09.663
Yeah, we got him fired
from the Buy and Bag.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.564
How are you?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.500
Oh, this is the guy?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.968
Yes, this is the guy.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.070
It's good to see you
landed on your feet.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.271
Yes.

07:18.305 --> 07:22.876
Thanks to you, I'm on my
feet about 12 hours a day.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.713
By the way, would you
care to order some food,

07:25.746 --> 07:30.350
so you have something
to throw at each other?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.952
I think we're going
to need a little time.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.120
Yeah.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.555
Things are a lot different
now that we know we

07:34.588 --> 07:35.889
won't have to be leaving a tip.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.766
I really dislike you.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.937
By the way, may I
recommend the shellfish?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.539
I understand it's tainted.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.545
Hey, bring us out one of
those wine lists, will you?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.279
We need something
to roll a joint on.

08:04.718 --> 08:09.022
This is officially the most
embarrassing night of my life.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.624
Come on, Darlene,
this is great.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.426
You know, when my aunt died
all I got was a 22 acre farm.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.266
I can't believe this.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.635
You guys act like you've
never seen money before.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.103
Of course, we've
seen it, but the bank

08:23.136 --> 08:25.338
keeps complaining about our
nose prints on the glass.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.278
I'm serious.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.580
I mean, it's
embarrassing that you

08:32.613 --> 08:34.915
can't spend money like adults.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.051
Big talk for a girl who's
hitting us up for $100.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.353
Yeah, we all got
jobs, at least.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.756
You're the only one here
who has absolutely no money.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.600
It's not like you're
giving me the money.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.934
I'm borrowing it.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.004
And I'm going to pay back that
$100, plus every other loan

08:57.037 --> 08:59.607
you guys have ever given me.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.442
Oh, Darlene, just
making me laugh like that

09:02.475 --> 09:06.046
is repayment enough.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.016
Hey, I'm going to be
able to pay you back.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.685
I mean, if I took the job
that I was offered last week,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.887
I could pay you back
in a couple months.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.923
Well, I'm glad that
you didn't take it.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.257
We didn't send you
to college so you

09:17.290 --> 09:20.694
could drop out and take some
crummy job for $200 a week.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.896
Jobs like that are for people,
like David, who have no future.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.836
Look, the job is not for $200.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.837
OK.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.739
It was as an
advertising copywriter.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.406
And it started at $500 a week.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.948
[laughter]

09:40.981 --> 09:42.449
Oh, you guys.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.351
OK-- oh, OK.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.821
Darlene turned down
a $30,000 a year job.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.523
So, Mark, how's the
Senate treating you?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.464
That's a lot of
money, Darlene.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.732
Yeah-- well, so what?

09:58.766 --> 10:01.869
I mean, I want to finish
school, all right.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.338
Darlene, you go to college
so you can get a job like that.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.575
Yeah, but I can get a job like
that after I finish college--

10:08.608 --> 10:09.810
or a better one.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.746
God, I'm sorry I
brought this up.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.581
It's just that we can't
believe that you would

10:14.614 --> 10:17.017
turn something like that down.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.754
How much money
do you make, Dad?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.255
Oh, it's kind of hard to say.

10:22.289 --> 10:28.361
What with-- you know, over
time, retirement, benefits--

10:28.395 --> 10:29.262
weekly salary--

10:29.296 --> 10:30.764
Uh, hey, everybody, come on.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.265
We're going to order, aren't we?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.401
Yeah, what the hell's
taking us so long?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
Come on.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.138
Always a pain
in the butt going

10:38.171 --> 10:40.908
out anywhere with you people.

10:40.941 --> 10:41.809
You know, you guys--

10:41.842 --> 10:43.510
I didn't mean to
like make this--

10:43.543 --> 10:45.445
Darlene, please-- we're
trying to get the waiter.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.114
Everybody know what they want?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.083
Yeah, I think I do.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.819
Darlene and I
are going to laugh

10:51.852 --> 10:53.453
so hard about this some day.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.460
HERCULES (ON TV):
Release the princess

11:00.493 --> 11:02.896
or I will destroy the village.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.498
What is this crap?

11:05.532 --> 11:10.237
This is Hercules
versus a tribe

11:10.270 --> 11:14.441
with well oiled pectorals.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.643
Well, why are
we watching this?

11:16.676 --> 11:20.013
Because it's good, duh.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.182
Yeah, shut up, Darlene.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.552
Are you guys sucking the
soul from my body for sport?

11:25.585 --> 11:29.122
Or are you gaining some
sort of nourishment?

11:29.156 --> 11:31.124
Hey, we're watching
TV here, all right.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.965
DJ, what is that?

11:37.998 --> 11:38.999
It's a trombone.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.135
I bought it with my
inheritance money.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.705
You spent all $500
on that trombone?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.307
Your mother and I told
you to put half of it

11:47.340 --> 11:48.608
in a college fund.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.509
I did.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.044
This only cost $250.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.079
I'm not stupid.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.648
I don't know how to
play the trombone.

11:55.682 --> 11:59.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, young man.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.654
Why did you buy a trombone?

12:01.688 --> 12:04.758
I bought it because
there's this girl I like.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.859
I'm not getting it.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.529
Yeah, neither do a
lot of trombone players.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.898
Darlene--

12:10.931 --> 12:12.565
All right, I like
this girl who plays

12:12.599 --> 12:14.334
first tuba in the school band.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.104
And last trombone sits
next to the first tuba.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.439
Just like it
says in the Bible--

12:19.472 --> 12:22.342
All right, so
here's how it works.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.311
I walk on in there.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.147
I sit down next to the chick.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.916
I pull out the trombone.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.751
She likes the trombone.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.652
I say, hi.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.987
I see you play the tuba.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.755
You're very beautiful.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.159
Boom-- she's mine.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.894
God, DJ--

12:40.928 --> 12:42.195
Ladies are my toys.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.797
Wind them up, watch them go.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.670
Atta boy--

12:53.807 --> 12:55.608
Nice parenting, dad.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.644
Giving your son
permission to manipulate

12:57.677 --> 12:59.046
some poor little girl--

12:59.079 --> 13:03.016
I can't believe he spent half
his inheritance on a trombone.

13:03.050 --> 13:08.321
Why it sounds like a typical
Conner family purchase to me.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.590
Hey, dad, still got
the electric rake?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.026
Hey, I've had just about
enough of you, Darlene.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.864
Knock it off, all right.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.231
What's wrong with you?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.132
What's wrong with me?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.267
I'll tell you what's wrong me.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.869
I'm sick and tired of
your sarcastic comments

13:21.902 --> 13:24.537
about my house and my family.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.973
Dad, I've been saying
this kind of stuff

13:26.006 --> 13:27.540
since I could talk.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.277
Before that I just
pointed and laughed.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.980
Well, gee, Darlene, somehow
it just isn't funny anymore.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.414
So why don't you
make some rye comment

13:34.447 --> 13:36.449
about how we've all
lost our sense of humor

13:36.483 --> 13:37.317
and be on your way.

13:55.068 --> 13:55.969
[trombone]

13:58.038 --> 13:59.873
[music playing]

14:02.442 --> 14:05.078
What's wrong with this family?

14:05.112 --> 14:06.546
Your father and I
are really brothers.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.920
No, I'm serious.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.522
I mean, a minute ago he
was jumping down my throat.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.991
And now he won't even
hardly talk to me.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.460
You know-- I mean, if he wants
me to stop making fun of him

14:20.493 --> 14:22.295
then he should stop
walking around this dump

14:22.329 --> 14:24.364
with shaving cream in his ears.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.532
You're right, Darlene.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.734
So sorry your father
and this house

14:27.767 --> 14:29.336
aren't up to your standards.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.006
I wish we could have
done better for you.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.307
I'm just saying--

14:34.341 --> 14:35.642
No, I know what you're saying.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.210
Everybody knows
what you're saying.

14:37.244 --> 14:41.014
And you've been saying
it since you got here.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.284
Oh, what-- so now you're
going to give me this crap too?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.618
You know, I thought
I could come in here

14:45.652 --> 14:47.120
and talk to you
like a human being.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.288
You think that's possible?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.122
Arf--

14:52.259 --> 14:53.260
You know what?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.195
Maybe I should just
go back to school.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.563
Yeah, maybe you should.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.665
And maybe I shouldn't
come back until spring.

14:58.698 --> 15:02.936
Great, more $100 bills for me.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.304
Good.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.905
I think her spending a little
less time around this house

15:05.939 --> 15:09.376
wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.579
Kid's got to learn to have
some respect, Roseanne.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.682
Taking her down a notch
was the right thing to do.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.118
Yeah, well, just stand
there and keep yapping, Dan.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.486
Let me know if you
ever hit on anything.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.256
Darlene--

15:23.290 --> 15:24.524
Oh, great, more yelling.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.592
No.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.227
There isn't going to
be any more yelling.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.231
First of all, I'm really glad
that you're going to school

15:31.264 --> 15:33.433
and, you know, getting
an education like I never

15:33.466 --> 15:35.268
got because I got
all lost in that love

15:35.302 --> 15:37.604
and peace crap of the '60s.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.706
Then 10 years later I realized
I should've listened to all

15:39.739 --> 15:41.774
those women who said learn
how to support yourself

15:41.808 --> 15:43.776
or you're going to be screwed.

15:43.810 --> 15:47.414
Well, mom, that is exactly
what I'm trying to do.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.815
I know.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.718
So maybe I'm a little jealous
of you because of all the stuff

15:51.751 --> 15:54.754
that I had to do in order
for you to get there.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.657
Like, working really hard in
beauty salons, restaurants,

15:57.690 --> 16:00.327
and factories is pretty
mind numbing, you know,

16:00.360 --> 16:04.164
especially if you have to
stay hammered the whole time.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.065
Tell me about it.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.567
That's how I got
through puberty.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.503
But the good part is
that I was able to give

16:10.537 --> 16:12.605
my kids better than I had.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.041
And you're going
to be able to do

16:14.074 --> 16:16.276
amazing things for your kids.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.911
Every parent tries to
improve things at least 50%

16:18.945 --> 16:20.147
for their kids.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.482
And if they can do that then
they're a total success.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.589
50% is kind of a
conservative estimate.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.059
Just by walking erect,
I improved it 30.

16:38.031 --> 16:42.669
But, you know, this college
thing is really hard for me

16:42.702 --> 16:43.503
too.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.576
I mean, I'm surrounded by all
these rich kids that don't have

16:49.609 --> 16:51.344
to bust their ass,
because if they fail,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.680
their daddy's there
to bail them out.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.083
Yeah, well, your daddy
can't bail you out.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.917
My daddy couldn't
bail me out, you know,

16:57.950 --> 16:59.252
but stuff like
that-- it just ends

16:59.286 --> 17:00.820
up making a stronger, Darlene.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.591
I can't let you turned
down a great job like that.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.658
Well, I told you.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.328
I just want to finish
school, all right.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.263
And besides, it's
in advertising.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.299
I don't think I want to
devote the rest of my life

17:12.332 --> 17:17.104
to coming up with the next,
I'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.238
OK, hold it.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.873
I respect you for being
all anti-corporate,

17:20.907 --> 17:23.143
and burn the flag, and blah blah
blah blah, because, you know,

17:23.176 --> 17:24.777
that's the way I
was in the '60s.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.679
So I'm kind of glad
that some of my ideals

17:26.713 --> 17:28.715
made it to my daughter, but--

17:28.748 --> 17:30.750
Number two, this is the '90s.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.653
And you can't pay your rent
with that kind of thinking.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.456
And number three, you
are so out of your mind

17:36.489 --> 17:38.291
if you think you are ever
going to top anything

17:38.325 --> 17:41.761
like I'm cuckoo for coco puffs.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.132
OK, but you're all
over the map here.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.767
Do you respect my ideals
for turning down a job?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.437
Or do you think I'm stupid
for turning down a job?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.605
Well, I really don't
know what I think, Darlene.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.308
I mean, this is new
territory for us.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.277
No Conner's ever
turned down a job--

17:57.310 --> 17:58.378
ever.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.512
It's kind of like
the same reason

17:59.546 --> 18:03.616
drowning people don't
flip off the lifeguard.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.286
I'm still a Conner.

18:06.319 --> 18:10.423
Yeah, but, man-- $30,000.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.525
I mean, the mayor of
Landford, himself,

18:12.559 --> 18:13.660
doesn't even make that much.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.296
And he works two jobs.

18:16.329 --> 18:21.468
It's like, if you can make that
kind of money then, you know,

18:21.501 --> 18:25.138
you could be, like, one of them.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.039
Who's them?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.709
Them-- the ones that ain't us.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.644
So now when you come home
making fun of our family,

18:31.678 --> 18:34.247
and our house, and everything,
it just sounds pretty

18:34.281 --> 18:35.848
weird to me and your dad.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.317
You know, it's like
you're one of them.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.218
And you're putting us down.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.726
Um, got it.

18:46.759 --> 18:52.532
So what type of Helper will
we be dining on tonight?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.334
Well, we happen to be
out of Helper tonight,

18:54.367 --> 18:57.337
so I'll be using Rice
Krispies in preparing the meat

18:57.370 --> 18:58.738
and meat biproduct dinner.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.279
Well, so I have a little talk
with her and she's staying.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.180
Straighten her out?

19:07.214 --> 19:08.381
Yeah.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.882
Yeah, but, you know, she's
not the only one that

19:09.916 --> 19:10.983
needs to be straightened out.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.285
We've all got to adjust to this.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.586
Oh, I've got to adjust?

19:13.620 --> 19:16.923
Yeah, you do, actually.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.791
Hey, don't you think it's
cool that one of our kids

19:18.825 --> 19:20.627
might actually make it?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.129
Yeah, wow--

19:23.162 --> 19:25.198
I mean, she still
needs us, Dan.

19:25.232 --> 19:29.035
Or at least she still
needs that $100.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.638
So why don't you go up
there and give it to her.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.106
And that's supposed to make
you feel like a big provider?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.509

needs her big daddy--

19:36.543 --> 19:37.744
be right back.

good job with this one,

19:42.815 --> 19:44.150
didn't we?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.552
Yeah, we did.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.687
Man, it just looks
like the Conner

19:47.720 --> 19:49.055

19:56.162 --> 19:58.798
Don't ask.

20:12.445 --> 20:16.349
Now, Becky, we
agreed I'd talk to him.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.691

to think that certain
material possessions may

20:33.099 --> 20:35.234
help you succeed in
affairs of the heart.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.137
That dear, DJ, is folly.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.072
I don't understand.

She means, you
don't buy a trombone

so you can hit on some poor
unsuspecting tuba girl.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.016
Oh, that-- what's
wrong with it?

20:50.049 --> 20:52.218
Look, you little jerk--

20:52.251 --> 20:54.554
if you have no more respect
for women than that,

just not a right thing to do.

just not going to work.

Now, DJ, you-- you have--

21:12.472 --> 21:15.708
you have put your
little heart on a shelf.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.311
And it's going to fall off.
