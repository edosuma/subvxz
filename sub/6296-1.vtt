<i>...qui te custodiat</i>
<i>ab hoste maligno,</i>

02:04.533 --> 02:07.569
<i>et perducat</i>
<i>in vitam aeternam.</i>

02:07.603 --> 02:09.237
<i>Amen.</i>

02:11.240 --> 02:16.978
<i>Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo,</i>
<i>et mundabor: lavabis me,</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:18.880
<i>et super nivem dealbabor.</i>

02:18.914 --> 02:23.151
You are afraid
to enter, but you must.

02:23.185 --> 02:27.889
<i>- ...secundum multitudinem...</i>
<i>- I am about to meet my maker.</i>

02:27.923 --> 02:33.294
I have confessed.
And I...

02:33.329 --> 02:38.800
confess...
I am very afraid.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.535
Colonna.

02:40.569 --> 02:44.806
Sforza. Orsini.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.841
Borgia.

02:46.876 --> 02:50.578
- Your Holiness.
- Della Rovere.

02:50.613 --> 02:52.580
<i>...Gloria Patri...</i>

02:52.615 --> 03:01.422
You will fight like dogs
over this corpse I leave

03:01.457 --> 03:05.226
for this throne
of St. Peter's.

03:05.261 --> 03:10.365
But it was pure once.

03:10.399 --> 03:18.039
We have all sullied it
with our greed

03:18.073 --> 03:21.109
and lechery.

03:23.679 --> 03:28.917
Which of you...
will wash it clean?

03:31.287 --> 03:34.756
It shall be cleansed,
Your Holiness,

03:34.790 --> 03:37.759
with the tears
we shed for you.

03:37.793 --> 03:40.228
I swear
before the Living God.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.798
You swear thus?
A Spanish murrano? A white moor?

03:43.832 --> 03:46.034
As Vice-Chancellor,

03:46.068 --> 03:50.772
I swear
before the Living God.

03:50.806 --> 03:52.942
And so do I, Your Holiness.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.167
- And I, Your Holiness.
- And I.

03:55.244 --> 03:57.579
Rest assured,
Your Holiness.

03:57.613 --> 04:03.785
The glory of our Holy Mother
Church will be restored in my lifetime.

04:06.689 --> 04:10.224
Please...

04:10.259 --> 04:11.993
...God.

04:56.438 --> 05:00.174
There's a door behind--
leads to the street.

05:00.209 --> 05:02.143
The back passage?

05:04.146 --> 05:07.281
You're a cleric?
Didn't you notice?

05:07.316 --> 05:09.283
There was nothing
ecclesiastical about you

05:09.318 --> 05:12.020
last night.
By night...

05:12.054 --> 05:14.455
By night I am
who I want to be.

05:14.490 --> 05:17.125
By day, I am thus.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.529
Lucrezia!

05:23.766 --> 05:27.969
Sister!
I spied a lady--another one!

05:28.003 --> 05:29.971
There's a punishment
for spying.

05:30.005 --> 05:31.939
- What's that?
- Oh, I think you know!

05:31.974 --> 05:34.642
No!

05:39.348 --> 05:42.717
Can I come to your wedding?

05:42.751 --> 05:45.019
I'll never have a wedding,
you know that.

05:45.054 --> 05:48.156
No. You are betrothed to God.

05:50.159 --> 05:52.760
Don't you love God, Cesare?

05:52.795 --> 05:55.997
More than I love you?

05:56.031 --> 05:57.799
Don't be sad, brother.

05:57.833 --> 06:01.569
Maybe Papa will
become pope,

06:01.603 --> 06:03.905
and you can be
who you want to be.

06:03.939 --> 06:07.208
If he does become pope,
I'll be what he wants me to be.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.744
Can a pope have children,
Cesare?

06:09.778 --> 06:14.082
I've heard it rumoured
that Pope Innocent has 12.

06:14.116 --> 06:17.485
But I have also heard
it rumoured that he is dying.

06:17.519 --> 06:19.787
No news in that.
He's been dying for weeks now.

06:19.822 --> 06:22.990
If he does die,
will our father wear his crown?

06:24.993 --> 06:28.429
The new pope will be elected by
the College of Cardinals, my love.

06:28.464 --> 06:32.800
And only God can
predict the outcome.

06:32.835 --> 06:35.670
Well, since
you will have no wedding,

06:35.704 --> 06:38.272
I will pray for God
to choose Papa.

06:38.307 --> 06:40.047
I want to wear
a beautiful white

06:40.129 --> 06:42.323
veil crowned with pearls
for his coronation.

06:43.078 --> 06:45.480
God may need some help,
then.

06:49.985 --> 06:52.887
- What have they heard?
- The pope breathes his last.

06:52.921 --> 06:54.922
God rest his soul...

07:14.710 --> 07:17.678
We must get you out of here
before they lock the doors.

07:17.713 --> 07:20.748
- And so it begins.
- You know what to do?

07:20.783 --> 07:23.584
- Yes, Father.
- Keep our family safe.

07:23.619 --> 07:27.188
Until the new pope is elected,
it will be anarchy in Rome--

07:27.222 --> 07:29.924
every faction fighting
for its own candidate.

07:29.958 --> 07:32.927
And if--after the first vote--
if the smoke is black--

07:32.961 --> 07:37.265
As you said, Father,
I know what to do.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.538
I have waited
a lifetime for this moment.

07:43.572 --> 07:46.073
We will go over it
again.

07:46.108 --> 07:50.278
If we fail at the first vote,
I will send word...

07:50.312 --> 07:51.579
On the wings of a dove--

07:51.613 --> 07:55.216
...names of those cardinals
who need persuading.

07:55.250 --> 07:58.186
With properties, benefices,
and, if need be, gold.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.421
They call it simony,
Father.

08:00.455 --> 08:02.590
God will forgive us,
my son.

08:02.624 --> 08:05.426
But I will
not forgive failure...

08:05.460 --> 08:08.763
...from you
or your brother.

08:08.797 --> 08:10.398
Am I understood?

08:10.432 --> 08:14.502
We will not fail you,
Father.

08:17.239 --> 08:18.739
Mm.

08:22.277 --> 08:23.778
Go now.

08:27.783 --> 08:31.384
Back to Spain, Borgia!
You've had your day in Rome.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.077
You can't wring any more
favours from a dead pope.

08:34.256 --> 08:35.763
I was born here,
as far as I'm aware.

08:35.788 --> 08:37.390
If a pig is born
in a stable,

08:37.393 --> 08:40.549
does that make him a horse?

08:41.697 --> 08:43.898
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

08:43.932 --> 08:46.067
Rome is
for Romans now.

08:46.101 --> 08:48.870
The new pope will see
to that.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.838
And if the new pope is
Spanish?

08:50.873 --> 08:53.207
And if my mother's
the Virgin Mary?

08:53.242 --> 08:56.043
Was the Virgin a Roman whore?
That's news to me.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.935
Excuse me.

09:20.969 --> 09:23.971
- Ah!
- Ah...

09:24.006 --> 09:26.841
My brother speaks
before he thinks.

09:26.875 --> 09:30.478
He begs your pardon.

09:36.852 --> 09:40.354
I should have let them do it.
Kill me? Your younger brother?

09:40.389 --> 09:43.190
Our father would
never have forgiven you.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.774
Have you heard?

09:59.808 --> 10:02.376
Even Gioffre has
heard. Have you not?

10:02.411 --> 10:05.246
- The pope has died.
- You know what that means?

10:05.280 --> 10:07.315
I know
there will be an election.

10:07.349 --> 10:09.917
And the city will be bedlam
until it's over.

10:09.952 --> 10:12.753
Do you think
our father can win, Juan?

10:12.788 --> 10:14.922
Are we allowed
to dream, Mother?

10:14.957 --> 10:18.417
Your father found ways to love
and care for us in this house,

10:18.442 --> 10:21.107
but I'm not sure
as pope he can do the same.

10:21.108 --> 10:22.923
As pope, he can do
what he wants.

10:23.364 --> 10:24.832
Are you sure?

10:24.885 --> 10:27.215
Kings and popes and emperors
belong to their peoples,

10:27.869 --> 10:29.503
not to their families.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.757
So, we allow the election
to run its course,

10:31.758 --> 10:34.129
and he won't be pope.
What other course is there?

10:34.142 --> 10:36.844
It's in the hands of God.
It's in the hands

10:36.878 --> 10:41.716
of the College of Cardinals,
Mother. It's not quite the same thing.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.551
This one.

10:49.825 --> 10:53.060
- Cardinal Borgia.
- My Lord Cardinal.

10:53.095 --> 10:57.598
- Whoever wins this contest--
- Election.

10:59.601 --> 11:02.269
If you were
a different man...

11:02.304 --> 11:04.805
...I might vote
for you.

11:04.840 --> 11:09.643
You've performed your duties
as Vice-Chancellor admirably.

11:09.678 --> 11:12.380
The Church has need
of your...

11:12.414 --> 11:16.584
...organizational
genius.

11:16.618 --> 11:18.552
But...

11:18.587 --> 11:21.022
She has other needs
as well.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.690
And they would be?

11:22.724 --> 11:25.793
Honesty.

11:25.827 --> 11:28.095
Probity.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.398
Goodness.

11:30.432 --> 11:33.667
You find me lacking
in those qualities?

11:33.702 --> 11:35.636
Yes.

11:35.670 --> 11:38.205
And so
I shall fight you.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.643
To the end, and beyond that, if need be,
with any means at my disposal.

11:44.813 --> 11:47.748
I do tend to win
whatever battles I fight.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.521
But what talk we
of fighting?

11:53.555 --> 11:55.890
It is all
in God's hands.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.428
Good night,
My Lord.

12:07.202 --> 12:09.904
To Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,

12:09.938 --> 12:12.406
four votes.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.242
To Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,

12:15.277 --> 12:17.645
six votes.

12:17.679 --> 12:20.915
To Cardinal Guilliano
Della Rovere,

12:20.949 --> 12:23.818
seven votes.

12:23.852 --> 12:27.221
To Cardinal Orsino Orsini,

12:27.255 --> 12:29.290
six votes.

12:29.324 --> 12:34.695
None has the require
majority...

12:41.903 --> 12:43.504
<i>Dominus Deum...</i>

12:43.538 --> 12:46.507
After the death
of Pope Sixtus,

12:46.541 --> 12:48.984
they holed us up here
for a month...

12:49.627 --> 12:50.827
Appalling.

12:50.846 --> 12:56.851
The company was tolerable,
but as for the food...

12:56.885 --> 12:59.120
I had to lead
the revolt--

12:59.154 --> 13:03.190
insist our dishes could be
brought in from outside.

13:03.225 --> 13:04.925
How wise.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.762
And now there's crystal
in my soup.

13:08.797 --> 13:10.564
Please,

13:10.599 --> 13:12.900
have mine,
Your Grace.

13:12.934 --> 13:15.603
Oh.

13:15.637 --> 13:18.239
Don't drink this.
It's vinegar; I've tasted it.

13:22.177 --> 13:26.046
From my vineyards
in Valencia.

13:33.121 --> 13:34.655
How can I thank you?

13:34.689 --> 13:36.724
Hmm...
I wonder...

13:38.727 --> 13:39.693
Mmm!

13:39.728 --> 13:41.595
<i>...est a me...</i>

13:41.630 --> 13:44.365
The rules are clear.
No outside contact is

13:44.399 --> 13:46.367
permitted
under any circumstance.

13:46.401 --> 13:51.079
But you must know that Cardinal
Versucci's digestion is very delicate.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.773
Which is why he has
rabbit baked in milk.

13:54.632 --> 13:55.734
Ah.

13:55.777 --> 13:58.279
Good.
And...

13:58.313 --> 14:00.681
Cardinal
Piccolomini...

14:00.715 --> 14:02.750
Uh...

14:02.784 --> 14:05.586
Suckling pig
with rosemary.

14:05.620 --> 14:09.256
Indeed. The well-being
of the curia...

14:09.291 --> 14:12.459
...is of the greatest
importance. As Vice-Chancellor,

14:12.494 --> 14:15.462
their health is my concern.
<i>Mens sana in corpore sano.</i>

14:15.497 --> 14:18.399
I think St. Augustine might
disagree with you. He extolled

14:18.433 --> 14:22.169
the virtues of fasting.
St. Augustine...

14:22.204 --> 14:24.772
...never had to vote
in conclave.

14:31.780 --> 14:33.581
<i>My dear sons,</i>

14:33.615 --> 14:37.117
<i>the Cardinals Versucci,</i>
<i>Piccolomini, and Sanso,</i>

14:37.152 --> 14:39.153
<i>grant some titles</i>

14:39.187 --> 14:41.989
<i>and benefices</i>
<i>from the Borgia abbeys,</i>

14:42.023 --> 14:43.757
<i>monasteries, and bishoprics.</i>

14:43.792 --> 14:46.794
<i>...Versucci,</i>
<i>Piccolomini, and Sanso,</i>

14:46.828 --> 14:50.564

<i>monasteries, and bishoprics.</i>

14:52.968 --> 14:57.338
Julius... Versucci...

14:57.372 --> 15:00.908
All rights
to the Abbey of...

15:00.942 --> 15:03.677
...St. Catherine
of Siena.

15:03.712 --> 15:06.180
Cardinal
Allesandro Piccolomini.

15:06.214 --> 15:08.549
Suckling pig

15:08.583 --> 15:10.618
for the cardinal,
roasted.

15:10.652 --> 15:13.220
Roasted and...

15:13.255 --> 15:15.055
...stuffed.

15:15.090 --> 15:18.459
- Cardinal Julius Versucci.
- Uh, rabbit.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.894
Rabbit...

15:20.929 --> 15:23.297
...baked in milk.

15:57.032 --> 15:58.532
Tasty.

16:00.035 --> 16:03.637
Cardinal
Giuliano Della Rovere...

16:03.672 --> 16:06.707
...has garnered ten votes.

16:06.741 --> 16:10.844
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,
five.

16:10.879 --> 16:15.449
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered eight votes.

16:15.483 --> 16:18.952
But none has the required
majority.

16:22.991 --> 16:25.793
<i>My dear son,</i>

16:25.827 --> 16:28.495
<i>we are in sight</i>
<i>of our goal,</i>

16:28.530 --> 16:31.198
<i>but now you must redouble</i>
<i>our efforts.</i>

16:31.232 --> 16:33.734
<i>Send your brother</i>
<i>round the Borgia churches</i>

16:33.768 --> 16:37.871
<i>to empty them of gold, ornamen,</i>
<i>and precious stone.</i>

16:37.906 --> 16:40.341
I have emptied the churches
of the Romagna.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.843
I have
stripped altars bare.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.179
They were rotten
with gold ornament.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.147
Yes, you are
a true reformer, brother.

16:47.182 --> 16:50.184
These cardinals know no vows
of poverty.

16:53.788 --> 16:56.457
Why the dove,
Cesare?

16:58.460 --> 17:01.095
It has a dual purpose,
my love.

17:01.129 --> 17:03.464
Like many things
in life,

17:03.498 --> 17:07.000
it serves as both a symbol
and a messenger.

17:07.035 --> 17:11.505
- A symbol of what?
- Of the uncorrupted soul.

17:11.539 --> 17:14.340
And a messenger of what?

17:14.376 --> 17:16.609
Of corruption.

17:16.644 --> 17:20.481
You mean to say it bears news
of how many votes

17:20.515 --> 17:23.416
we must buy
in the Papal election.

17:23.451 --> 17:25.486
You are criminally
well informed, sis.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.388
But I trust your soul is still
of the purest white.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.692
How many votes
must we buy him, Cesare?

17:31.726 --> 17:33.694
You know too much already,
don't you?

17:33.728 --> 17:36.764
You're wrong.
I know too little...

17:36.798 --> 17:39.900
<i>Dear Father,</i>
<i>nine mules laden down</i>

17:39.934 --> 17:42.636
<i>with gold and treasure are being</i>
<i>distributed</i>

17:42.670 --> 17:44.905
<i>to the palaces</i>
<i>of the following cardinals:</i>

17:44.939 --> 17:48.041
Cardinal Guiliano Della Rovere
has garnered...

17:48.076 --> 17:50.811
...Cardinal Ascana Sforza has
garnered four...

17:50.845 --> 17:55.082
...Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered ten votes.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.551
None has the required
majority.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.428
Of course, Cardinal Sforza,
the entire conclave knows

18:07.462 --> 18:09.930
that I cannot be both
Vice-Chancellor

18:09.964 --> 18:11.932
and pope of Rome.

18:11.966 --> 18:15.068
Than you can no longer be
a Vice-Chancellor.

18:15.103 --> 18:17.004
You mean...

18:17.038 --> 18:19.873
...I may yet be
pope of Rome?

18:19.908 --> 18:24.378
If you can find
a suitable Vice-Chancellor.

18:24.412 --> 18:28.449
And how would you describe
the qualities necessary

18:28.483 --> 18:31.985
for a suitable Vice-Chancellor,
Cardinal Sforza?

18:33.988 --> 18:36.223
- Discretion.
- Mm-hmm.

18:36.257 --> 18:38.625
Loyalty.

18:40.628 --> 18:43.130
And a certain kind
of wisdom.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.501
Can you be
more specific?

18:49.504 --> 18:51.705
I would say
the one who would be suitable

18:51.739 --> 18:54.203
as Vice-Chancellor would be wise

18:54.228 --> 18:57.106
to support the Vice-Chancellor
who would be pope.

18:59.614 --> 19:01.114
Hmm.

19:03.785 --> 19:07.254
And I would say...

19:07.288 --> 19:09.456
...we have an understanding.

19:11.659 --> 19:16.563
Cardinal Guiliano Della Rovere
has garnered seven votes.

19:16.598 --> 19:22.169
Cardinal Alberto Colonna,
two.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.439
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia...

19:25.473 --> 19:27.741
...fourteen.

19:27.775 --> 19:32.145
Cardinal Borgia has
the required majority.

19:32.180 --> 19:36.283
Cardinal Borgia has bought

19:36.317 --> 19:38.785
the required majority.

19:38.820 --> 19:42.222
What is your implication?

19:42.257 --> 19:45.192
His implication is that
the throne of St. Peter's is

19:45.226 --> 19:47.194
for sale.
And has been bought

19:47.228 --> 19:49.863
by a Spaniard
up to his elbows in simony.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.199
I see.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.701
You would prefer it had been
bought by an Italian?

19:54.736 --> 19:59.239
By someone remotely worthy
of the papacy at least--

19:59.274 --> 20:03.010
Then my first act
as pope will be to institute

20:03.044 --> 20:05.345
an enquiry
into the elective process.

20:05.380 --> 20:08.315
My second, of course...

20:08.349 --> 20:12.786
...will be to appoint
a Vice-Chancellor--

20:12.820 --> 20:17.057
the greatest office,
with the greatest income,

20:17.091 --> 20:18.792
in my gift.

20:18.826 --> 20:22.629
Now, there are
two obvious choices:

20:22.664 --> 20:25.265
Cardinals Della Rovere
and Orsini.

20:25.300 --> 20:29.036
But the pope could
not possibly appoint one

20:29.070 --> 20:32.306
who questioned his right
to be pope.

20:32.340 --> 20:34.308
That was
not my intention.

20:34.342 --> 20:37.678
Nor was it mine.

20:37.712 --> 20:40.814
I see.

20:40.848 --> 20:45.552
And the Spanish race is closest
to your bosom.

20:52.393 --> 20:56.463
Can we proceed, then?
To conclude:

20:56.497 --> 20:59.366
Cardinal Borgia has the required
majority

20:59.400 --> 21:05.539
An examination, <i>testes</i>
<i>et pendentes,</i> is required.

21:05.573 --> 21:09.910
And Cardinal Borgia is happy
to comply.

21:21.522 --> 21:24.958
Can there be any doubt
that the good cardinal is male?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.960
Not if we count
his children.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.963
Let him without children cast
the first stone.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.798
I have heard rumours...

21:31.833 --> 21:34.835
...of a rhinoceros horn.
Ooh, that small?

21:34.869 --> 21:37.137
Boasting again?

22:02.797 --> 22:05.632
Oh, go on.
The suspense is killing them.

22:11.673 --> 22:14.274
<i>Habet duos testiculos...</i>

22:14.308 --> 22:18.111
<i>...et bene pendentes.</i>

22:18.146 --> 22:20.614
So, he's got two testicles,
well hung.

22:20.648 --> 22:22.549
<i>Deo gracias.</i>

23:17.805 --> 23:21.808
<i>Habemus papam!</i>

23:39.927 --> 23:45.732
<i>Pater, et lius,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sanctus.</i>

23:45.767 --> 23:48.268
<i>Amen.</i>

23:48.302 --> 23:52.472
<i>...tu es et dominus eternum...</i>

23:52.507 --> 23:57.010
<i>...et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

23:57.044 --> 23:59.212
<i>Amen.</i>
Oh!

24:02.216 --> 24:06.253
Your sins are all forgiven,
sisters.

24:06.287 --> 24:09.523
By the pope's bastard?

24:09.557 --> 24:12.626
Son!
His favourite son!

24:20.368 --> 24:23.170
I ask to confess
to you, Holy Father,

24:23.204 --> 24:27.674
because...
I have sinned.

24:27.708 --> 24:30.010
How have you sinned,
my son?

24:30.044 --> 24:33.013
I have corrupted
my soul.

24:33.047 --> 24:35.482
I have pledged estates,
castles,

24:35.516 --> 24:37.851
benefices
to your brother cardinals.

24:37.885 --> 24:41.492
I have transferred the
documents in the innards

24:41.517 --> 24:43.418
of roasted beasts
and fowls.

24:43.658 --> 24:46.526
All to secure
your election as pope.

24:46.561 --> 24:49.830
And God will repay us
tenfold.

24:51.833 --> 24:54.968
But you must set my soul
at ease, Father.

24:55.002 --> 24:59.739
Can a family such as ours
survive such a prize?

24:59.774 --> 25:03.009
We are Spaniards.
They hate us.

25:03.044 --> 25:08.348
The enemies we have at present
will be multiplied tenfold.

25:08.382 --> 25:13.430
God will protect his Vicar on Earth,
Cesare, and those dearest to him.

25:13.431 --> 25:16.754
And will you inform God
as to His duties in this regard?

25:18.267 --> 25:20.210
Why this blasphemous tone,
my son?

25:20.843 --> 25:23.306
Because I swear, if God
does not protect us, I shall.

25:23.364 --> 25:25.454
You are a bishop, Cesare.

25:25.479 --> 25:27.240
You have no need of such
temporal thoughts.

25:27.285 --> 25:29.299
You placed this collar
round my neck, Father.

25:29.657 --> 25:31.792
You made God my calling.

25:33.848 --> 25:36.518
But the sins I've committed for
you must convince you, surely,

25:36.519 --> 25:38.111
that the Church is
not my calling.

25:41.655 --> 25:43.086
I beg you now to release me

25:43.111 --> 25:45.169
of my vows. Let me live
as a layman.

25:45.581 --> 25:47.782
As a soldier.

25:47.816 --> 25:49.187
I can then protect our family

25:49.212 --> 25:50.884
from the storm that surely
must engulf it.

25:51.021 --> 25:52.934
You are my eldest son, Cesare.

25:52.959 --> 25:55.202
You were always destined to be
a prince of the Church.

25:55.457 --> 25:58.993
I would be a prince of state,
Father, and I think you know that.

25:59.027 --> 26:02.430
The papal army is small,
Cesare.

26:02.464 --> 26:06.434
The battles I will fight will be
within these sacred walls.

26:06.468 --> 26:10.204
This is where I will need
your help. Juan can...

26:10.239 --> 26:13.941
...bear arms for the Borgia family,
and lead whatever army the pope has,

26:13.976 --> 26:16.644
and I will not have my authority
questioned further on this.

26:16.678 --> 26:21.482
<i>Ego te absolvo ab omnibus</i>
<i>censuris, et peccatis,</i>

26:21.516 --> 26:26.721
<i>in nomine Patris, et Filii,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>

26:43.305 --> 26:45.539
You think it fits me,
brother?

26:45.574 --> 26:48.075
You have broad shoulders.

26:48.110 --> 26:50.077
As have you.

26:50.112 --> 26:52.480
Though it lacks
an insignia.

26:52.514 --> 26:55.082
I thought a cape
to cover the breastplate,

26:55.117 --> 26:57.251
with the Borgia Bull
in bright yellow.

26:57.286 --> 26:59.954
I favour black, myself.

26:59.988 --> 27:03.090
Black for the cleric,
but for the soldier,

27:03.125 --> 27:05.192
a prancing bull
in yellow.

27:05.227 --> 27:08.596
Or red, perhaps?

27:08.630 --> 27:10.965
Black.

27:10.999 --> 27:13.434
It suits you.

27:27.983 --> 27:31.519
- Welcome, Papa.
- Oh, I've missed you.

27:31.553 --> 27:34.522
- So, you have won.
- Yes, I've won.

27:34.556 --> 27:37.224
You've won
what you always wanted.

27:37.259 --> 27:39.260
My congratulations.

27:41.263 --> 27:44.565
And I have...
lost.

27:44.599 --> 27:46.170
But what have you lost,
my love?

27:46.195 --> 27:47.395
You.

27:47.769 --> 27:50.204
You'll never lose me.

27:50.238 --> 27:55.142
In spirit, maybe, but...

27:55.177 --> 27:58.012
in the flesh,
I may have to.

27:58.046 --> 28:00.147
The pope cannot love?

28:00.182 --> 28:02.383
The pope can love God.

28:02.417 --> 28:05.152
But to be seen
to love anyone else would be...

28:05.187 --> 28:07.888
...unthinkable.

28:07.923 --> 28:12.126
So we'll find ways
to accommodate our affections.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.329
Something
like we've always done.

28:15.364 --> 28:20.568
All of Rome knows you're
the mother to my children.

28:20.602 --> 28:25.239
Not only must the pope be chaste;
he must be seen to be chaste.

28:25.273 --> 28:27.775
The children.

28:27.809 --> 28:30.511
You can be seen
to love them, no?

28:30.545 --> 28:32.279
Of course!

28:36.985 --> 28:41.455
I always knew
this day would come.

28:41.490 --> 28:43.958
As long as you are with me
in spirit...

28:43.992 --> 28:47.028
- I always will be.
- And with no one else.

28:49.898 --> 28:53.567
That is equally impossible,
Vannozza.

28:53.602 --> 28:58.706
So we take vows of chastity
along with your new status?

28:58.740 --> 29:01.575
Must we take vows
of poverty too?

29:01.610 --> 29:03.844
Poverty?

29:03.879 --> 29:06.814
God forbid!

29:06.848 --> 29:09.383
<i>For the ceremonial processio,</i>

29:09.418 --> 29:14.755
<i>horses, arms and livery</i>
<i>for 700 priests and 23 cardinas</i>

29:14.790 --> 29:18.125
<i>with their retinues,</i>
<i>knights, and grandees.</i>

29:18.160 --> 29:20.928
<i>For Pope Alexander,</i>

<i>You look beautiful, Mother.</i>

29:36.445 --> 29:39.080
But you must try to remember
you're not in mourning.

29:39.114 --> 29:40.781
But perhaps I am.

29:42.784 --> 29:45.419
Like you are losing
your family?

29:45.454 --> 29:47.421
The life we have lived.

29:47.456 --> 29:49.590
What are we gaining?

29:49.624 --> 29:51.592
The future.

29:56.698 --> 30:00.701
♪

30:31.099 --> 30:34.068
Step! Step!

32:35.490 --> 32:37.958
Take the tiara...

32:37.993 --> 32:41.595
...which is ornamented
with three crowns...

32:41.630 --> 32:43.664
...and be aware...

32:43.698 --> 32:47.234
that you are father
of kings and monarchs,

32:47.269 --> 32:50.337
lord of the globe,

32:50.372 --> 32:55.476
earthly resident
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

32:55.510 --> 32:57.578
our Redeemer,

32:57.612 --> 33:00.781
who shall have
the power

33:00.815 --> 33:05.919
and the glory
forever and ever.

33:08.790 --> 33:10.291
Amen.

33:13.795 --> 33:15.396
His Holiness,

33:15.430 --> 33:17.431
Pope...

33:17.465 --> 33:20.434
...Alexander Sixtus.

33:20.468 --> 33:24.438
That is so many titles,
Cesare.

33:24.472 --> 33:27.941
What will his family
call him now?

33:27.976 --> 33:30.077
Holy Father.

33:30.111 --> 33:33.280
Holy Father.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.115
That's easy.

33:35.150 --> 33:36.617
Even I can remember that.

33:36.651 --> 33:39.653
...grants to all faithful
here present

33:39.688 --> 33:41.755
a plenary indulgence...

33:41.790 --> 33:44.958
- And tell me, dear brother--
- What, sis?

33:44.993 --> 33:48.128
What must I call myself?

33:48.163 --> 33:49.663
Holy Daughter?

33:49.698 --> 33:52.800
You are still
Lucrezia Borgia, my love.

33:52.834 --> 33:55.836
You will only change your name
when you marry.

33:55.870 --> 33:59.340
- And when will I marry?
- Never, if I can help it.

33:59.374 --> 34:02.443
But surely it is good
to marry, Cesare?

34:04.446 --> 34:06.146
As the pope's daughter,

34:06.181 --> 34:09.683
you will have every prince
of Europe vying for your hand.

34:12.353 --> 34:15.922
They may care very little
for your heart.

34:15.956 --> 34:19.059
Perhaps I should do
as you have done, brother--

34:19.094 --> 34:22.596
take Holy Orders.
Give my heart to God.

34:22.630 --> 34:25.399
That might be
the safer option, my love.

34:25.433 --> 34:28.402
Does Papa have
so many enemies?

34:28.436 --> 34:31.304
As our father,
perhaps not.

34:31.339 --> 34:33.306
But as pope...

34:33.341 --> 34:37.344
I am Rodrigo Borgia
no longer.

34:37.379 --> 34:40.813
I am Alexander Sixtus.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.083
But you know
who you are.

34:43.118 --> 34:45.786
My father, still.

34:45.820 --> 34:49.956
I am no longer "I".
I am... "we".

34:51.993 --> 34:57.231
We felt so...
alone out there.

34:57.265 --> 35:00.634
When the crown touched
our head.

35:04.572 --> 35:06.440
Humbled, even.

35:08.443 --> 35:12.012
Even frightened.
You surprise me, Father.

35:14.582 --> 35:15.855
You would surprise yourself

35:15.880 --> 35:17.993
if such destiny ever brushed
against you.

35:22.624 --> 35:24.625
Quite alone...

35:28.129 --> 35:31.432
...with just the...

35:31.466 --> 35:34.368
...silence of God...

35:34.402 --> 35:37.438
...as your witness.

35:37.472 --> 35:40.441
But He must already be
pleased, Holy Father.

35:40.475 --> 35:42.943
Ahhh!

35:42.977 --> 35:46.079
Indeed?

35:46.114 --> 35:48.081
Why?

35:48.116 --> 35:51.819
Because the earth has
not yet swallowed us.

35:56.925 --> 35:58.926
Here we are.

36:01.729 --> 36:03.931
You must help me,
Cesare.

36:05.934 --> 36:08.302
You must help me
interpret...

36:08.336 --> 36:10.804
...the great silence
of God.

36:12.774 --> 36:15.342
Wait!
Let me!

36:19.080 --> 36:22.950
Come.
Help me... do His will.

36:25.420 --> 36:28.055
We have been entrusted...

36:28.089 --> 36:31.391
...with the keys
to His kingdom.

36:31.426 --> 36:34.728
The King of France must be
aware, Ambassador,

36:34.762 --> 36:39.066
that we have placed the papal
mitre in the hands of an ape.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.333
He has hopes, Cardinal,
that the office brings

36:42.358 --> 36:43.658
its own grace with it,

36:43.660 --> 36:46.762
and that the grace of God can
transform the worst of men.

36:47.108 --> 36:48.742
And if it doesn't?

36:48.776 --> 36:52.980
We will observe with interest
what harm a mitred ape can do.

36:53.014 --> 36:55.115
Hm.

36:55.149 --> 36:57.684
These offices we grant
in the full expectation

36:57.719 --> 37:00.521
they will be used wisely
for the restoration

37:00.555 --> 37:03.357
of the honour
of our Holy Mother Church.

37:03.391 --> 37:04.758
<i>Dominus vobiscum.</i>

37:04.792 --> 37:08.262
- <i>Dominus vobiscum.</i>
<i>- And, finally,</i>

37:08.296 --> 37:14.468
the greatest office in our gift,
the post of Vice-Chancellor,

37:14.502 --> 37:18.405
the office that stands
a reed's width

37:18.439 --> 37:20.807
from our papacy.

37:20.842 --> 37:23.744
We grant...

37:23.778 --> 37:26.847
...the most august,
the most valued colleague,

37:26.881 --> 37:32.386
the brightest hope
for the future of the Church,

37:32.420 --> 37:34.755
Cardinal...

37:34.789 --> 37:37.624
...Ascanio Sforza.

37:43.031 --> 37:45.232
Simony!

37:45.266 --> 37:47.601
I charge you now
in public

37:47.635 --> 37:53.140
with trading sacred offices
like a market huckster!

37:53.174 --> 37:56.343
May I remind the cardinal
he is in consistry.

37:56.377 --> 37:58.545
Perhaps we misheard him.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.715
That office was promised
to me.

38:01.749 --> 38:04.885
Ah.
Did you pay for it?

38:04.919 --> 38:07.888
With my acceptance
of your foul election.

38:07.922 --> 38:11.892
When the pope pledges
to banish all suspicion

38:11.926 --> 38:15.896
of simony from the cardinalate,
he keeps his word.

38:15.930 --> 38:19.700
God has chosen us
as a new broom

38:19.734 --> 38:24.004
to sweep the Vatican clean
of corruption, which is

38:24.038 --> 38:27.841
precisely why we choose one
who has no expectation

38:27.875 --> 38:33.046
of advancement--
Cardinal Sforza.

38:40.388 --> 38:45.192
And I pray I may prove worthy
of the honour.

38:45.226 --> 38:49.162
And I pray so too.

38:49.197 --> 38:51.098
In fact,

38:51.132 --> 38:55.836
I fully approve
of his new... broom.

39:01.876 --> 39:03.977
Kiss the ring,
you fool.

39:07.081 --> 39:09.650
As do I.

39:11.819 --> 39:18.191
And I deeply regret
my recent intemperance.

39:18.226 --> 39:25.365
In honour of his appointment,
I invite Cardinal Sforza,

39:25.400 --> 39:28.201
and Your Holiness

39:28.236 --> 39:30.704
and the College
of Cardinals

39:30.738 --> 39:33.407
to a banquet
at my palace

39:33.441 --> 39:36.309
in two days' time.

39:53.728 --> 39:56.063
Are you going
to share it with me?

39:56.097 --> 39:59.433
Share what,
Holy Father?

39:59.467 --> 40:02.769
Why you bring a monkey
to a banquet?

40:02.804 --> 40:04.803
Oh, I fear the other cardinals

40:04.828 --> 40:07.297
might not share your appetite
for reformation.

40:08.443 --> 40:10.243
And your monkey does?

40:10.278 --> 40:14.614
Why, yes. He is an excellent
judge of appetite.

40:14.649 --> 40:16.116
Huh!

40:16.150 --> 40:19.953
Reform to our Holy Mother Church
may happen slowly, but...

40:19.987 --> 40:24.357
God has spoken to me as he spoke
to my predecessor, Pope Innocent.

40:24.392 --> 40:26.460
Happen it must.

40:26.494 --> 40:30.093
Shall we dine on gruel
tonight, then, Your Holiness?

40:30.093 --> 40:32.646
I could inform my cooks.

40:32.671 --> 40:36.599
We are your guests tonight,
My Lord Cardinal. We will dine

40:36.930 --> 40:38.564
according to your choosing.

40:38.740 --> 40:41.875
Thank goodness.
I can have the wine poured?

40:41.909 --> 40:43.510
Let me taste that.

40:43.544 --> 40:47.380
It is of an excellent vintage,
My Lord.

40:47.415 --> 40:50.650
I have no doubt.

40:50.685 --> 40:55.222
Oh!

40:55.256 --> 40:57.491
And how is his palate?

41:02.063 --> 41:04.831
Well, it's superb.

41:04.866 --> 41:07.868
He salutes your good taste.
Thank you.

41:07.902 --> 41:10.670
A great wine,
like the papacy itself--

41:10.705 --> 41:13.039
mature, rounded,

41:13.074 --> 41:16.176
its roots in the soil,
its bouquet in the heavens,

41:16.210 --> 41:18.378
consumed by a monkey.

41:18.412 --> 41:23.316
I suspect a metaphor is
lurking there, My Lord Cardinal?

41:23.351 --> 41:26.820
We are but animals
blessed with an eternal soul.

41:26.854 --> 41:30.056
There go we,
but for the grace of God.

41:30.091 --> 41:33.193
It seems nature,
not metaphor, calls.

41:33.227 --> 41:37.197
He begs Your Lordship's pardon.

41:37.231 --> 41:40.033
Excuse me.

41:40.067 --> 41:42.302
Excuse my monkey.

41:47.575 --> 41:49.576
Why such a hurry?

42:17.772 --> 42:21.474
My God, you're fast.
For a cook.

42:21.509 --> 42:23.510
And you for a cleric.

42:26.113 --> 42:28.748
On kitchen duty?

42:28.783 --> 42:31.952
For tonight.

42:31.986 --> 42:36.156
- Who pays you?
- Cardinal Orsini.

42:36.190 --> 42:39.492
Whatever you're being paid,
I'll double it.

42:39.527 --> 42:42.295
I could use someone that fast.
You could?

42:42.330 --> 42:44.331
Oh, yeah.

42:50.438 --> 42:53.306
But not that stupid!

42:55.643 --> 42:59.713
Far from stupidity,
sire.

42:59.747 --> 43:04.551
I imagine from your offer
that you have need of me, yes?

43:04.585 --> 43:09.990
So to kill the servant you have
need of would indeed be stupid.

43:10.024 --> 43:11.821
Call me stupid, then.

43:11.846 --> 43:14.399
Tell me, tell me why
I shouldn't. Hmm?

43:15.796 --> 43:17.066
Because of the sixth
commandment,

43:17.091 --> 43:18.591
thou shalt not kill.

43:19.333 --> 43:22.435
I'll be forgiven.
The pope is my confessor.

43:24.438 --> 43:29.242
Because you'll never meet
another assassin like me.

43:31.245 --> 43:35.548
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

43:59.974 --> 44:04.544
But we were talking terms, yes?
We were.

44:06.547 --> 44:10.016
I would gladly work
for the pope or the pope's son,

44:10.051 --> 44:14.587
for these cardinals can,
as you know, prove fickle,

44:14.622 --> 44:16.723
and it seems
someone as pitiless as you--

44:16.757 --> 44:17.655
Yes?

44:17.680 --> 44:20.684
Needs someone
as pitiless as me.

44:22.096 --> 44:23.730
Elaborate.

44:23.764 --> 44:29.836
I have smothered infants
in their beds.

44:29.870 --> 44:33.406
But only
when their parents paid me.

44:37.044 --> 44:39.012
And in the powder?

44:39.046 --> 44:41.614
Eternal life.

44:43.617 --> 44:47.387
- For whom?
- You. Your father.

44:49.890 --> 44:51.358
It's not very subtle.

44:51.392 --> 44:54.461
No subtlety needed
tonight.

44:54.495 --> 44:56.629
They all want you dead.

45:14.081 --> 45:15.882
Serve this...

45:15.916 --> 45:17.917
...to Orsini.

45:58.559 --> 46:01.094
Your Grace.

46:01.128 --> 46:03.363
You are bleeding.

46:05.366 --> 46:07.667
Damned monkey bit me.

46:07.701 --> 46:12.172
Animals will do that.
They lack soul.

46:12.206 --> 46:15.575
I propose a toast.

46:15.609 --> 46:17.177
To harmony,

46:17.211 --> 46:19.312
amongst us,

46:19.346 --> 46:22.481
servants of God.
Harmony.

46:22.544 --> 46:27.019
To the communion of saints
and the forgiveness of sins.

46:27.721 --> 46:29.189
Amen.

46:29.223 --> 46:30.423
Amen.

46:38.766 --> 46:42.969
I'd like to propose
a second toast. To metaphor.

46:43.003 --> 46:46.206
- Why metaphor?
- Because she's so

46:46.240 --> 46:51.077
infinitely pliable. A prince
one minute, a monkey the next.

46:51.112 --> 46:53.809
And what her hidden meaning is

46:53.834 --> 46:56.981
only God in His infinite
wisdom knows.

47:01.555 --> 47:04.724
I propose another toast.

47:04.758 --> 47:08.161
- To monkeys.
- Monkeys?

47:08.195 --> 47:10.730
They lick your hand
one minute,

47:10.764 --> 47:12.645
bite your neck the next.

47:13.503 --> 47:16.393
And everyone knows what you do
with the monkey that bites you.

47:17.104 --> 47:19.906
And what do you do
with the monkey that bites you?

47:19.940 --> 47:22.175
Your Eminence, you're ill.

47:22.209 --> 47:23.810
You wring its neck.

47:28.415 --> 47:32.418
- Poison.
- Poison!

47:32.453 --> 47:34.454
I accuse!

47:34.488 --> 47:36.990
The cooks?
Come, Father.

47:42.062 --> 47:44.230
Send for help!

47:49.737 --> 47:52.038
- The poison was meant for us.
- That's not possible.

47:52.072 --> 47:53.973
We were saved by a monkey,
Father.

47:54.008 --> 47:55.475
You don't poison the pope!

47:55.509 --> 47:57.477
Are you aware
what the gossips call you?

47:57.511 --> 47:59.105
The mitred ape.

47:59.130 --> 48:00.530
Half of Rome was waiting
to celebrate this outcome--

48:00.581 --> 48:03.349
You poison a rat,
you poison a rabid dog!

48:03.384 --> 48:06.452
Not the Vicar of Rome,
not the heir to St. Peter!

48:06.487 --> 48:08.588
- Bring my carriage!
- The idea offends you?

48:08.622 --> 48:11.491
It offends me, it offends
nature, it offends God Himself!

48:11.525 --> 48:12.768
So, God will
take His revenge, then.

48:12.793 --> 48:16.191
Yes, He will. With our help.

48:17.464 --> 48:19.599
- Go!
- Yah!

Original Air Date on April 3, 2011

48:27.208 --> 48:28.675
Excellent service.

48:28.709 --> 48:32.178
- I fear it is not over yet.
- What do you mean?

48:32.213 --> 48:35.648
Well, there's more to your
Borgia family than father and son.

48:35.683 --> 48:39.819
- What do you mean?
- I mean we must hurry, My Lord.

48:39.853 --> 48:42.222
Your whole family's
in danger.

48:54.635 --> 48:56.603
- Micheletto!
- Am I too late?

48:56.637 --> 48:59.239
- We were waiting for you.
- Then you're too late!

48:59.273 --> 49:02.575
What are you doing?!

49:02.610 --> 49:04.244
Ah!

49:10.618 --> 49:12.118
Allow me, My Lord.

49:22.129 --> 49:25.265
Guards!

49:25.299 --> 49:28.334
- General!
- With me, quickly!

49:28.369 --> 49:30.803
Come on!

49:30.838 --> 49:33.973
Get out of my way!

49:39.513 --> 49:42.048
Pray somewhere else,
Cardinals.

49:44.852 --> 49:46.853
Arrest this household.

49:49.323 --> 49:52.325
You planned this massacre
thoroughly.

49:52.359 --> 49:53.993
If I had planned it, My Lord,

49:54.028 --> 49:57.230
believe me, we would not be
having this conversation.

49:57.264 --> 50:00.266
You're that meticulous?

50:00.301 --> 50:03.169
Always.

50:03.203 --> 50:05.505
And who planned it?

50:08.776 --> 50:12.312
Cardinal Orsini.

50:12.346 --> 50:13.846
And Della Rovere?

50:16.583 --> 50:19.919
I know nothing of him.

50:19.953 --> 50:21.421
In this affair,

50:24.024 --> 50:26.826
I had but one master.

50:26.860 --> 50:29.962
And now?

50:29.997 --> 50:35.001
And now
I am like a stray dog,

50:35.035 --> 50:36.869
masterless.

50:38.872 --> 50:42.675
Unless your kind offer
still stands.

50:42.710 --> 50:46.713
You could have...
let things take their course...

50:46.747 --> 50:49.015
Betrayed me.

50:49.049 --> 50:52.685
Most of your kind do.
My kind?

50:52.720 --> 50:56.622
I do not have
a kind.

51:00.327 --> 51:03.296
And I suspect
neither do you.

51:06.700 --> 51:09.969
Your name,
sweet assassin.

51:17.811 --> 51:19.746
Micheletto.

51:19.780 --> 51:22.749
You must prove yourself
worthy of my trust, th.

51:22.783 --> 51:27.587
- This is not proof enough?
- Perhaps. Perhaps not.

51:27.621 --> 51:31.958
Can you dispose  of these corpses?
You would keep them secret?

51:31.992 --> 51:34.227
More than that.
I would keep you secret.

51:37.064 --> 51:41.200
Dump them in the Tiber.
Meet me by the Vatican gates

51:41.235 --> 51:45.104
in two hours' time. We shall
discuss your future service.

51:51.645 --> 51:54.547
Mother.

51:54.581 --> 51:58.518
Are you trying
to frighten me?

51:58.552 --> 52:00.553
I'm sorry, Mother.

52:02.723 --> 52:05.992
Why are you here,
Cesare?

52:06.026 --> 52:08.461
I imagine things--

52:08.495 --> 52:10.530
murders,

52:10.564 --> 52:13.132
blood-spattered throats,

52:13.167 --> 52:15.868
poisoned chalices.

52:15.903 --> 52:19.906
Perhaps you're not wrong.
We have many enemies now.

52:22.576 --> 52:24.043
And Lucrezia?

52:24.077 --> 52:28.548
She's sleeping.
You miss her that much?

52:28.582 --> 52:30.716
Always.

52:30.751 --> 52:34.220
If anything happened
to her, I'd...

52:34.254 --> 52:36.289
...I'd die.

52:36.323 --> 52:39.392
What could possibly
happen?

52:39.426 --> 52:42.395
I'm putting a guard
on the house.

52:42.429 --> 52:44.897
Is it so dangerous
outside?

52:44.932 --> 52:46.899
We are in a different city
now.

52:46.934 --> 52:49.669
Is it still
called Rome?

52:49.703 --> 52:52.205
I'm not sure
it has a name.

52:54.374 --> 52:57.343
Father.

52:57.377 --> 53:00.012
Father!

53:00.047 --> 53:02.014
Father, I've had to place
a guard on the--

53:02.049 --> 53:06.486
The good cardinal, my son,
has been expressing his shock

53:06.520 --> 53:09.856
and dismay
at this evening's outcome.

53:09.890 --> 53:12.024
Poison, it seems,
was the cause

53:12.059 --> 53:14.494
of Cardinal Orsini's demise.

53:14.528 --> 53:16.529
One shudders
at the thought.

53:16.563 --> 53:18.097
As to who poisoned him,

53:18.131 --> 53:21.200
I have no idea.
Perhaps we should

53:21.235 --> 53:24.670
ask ourselves, who benefits most
from his death?

53:24.705 --> 53:26.739
And what are you implying,
Your Eminence?

53:26.773 --> 53:29.408
I am implying nothing.

53:29.443 --> 53:32.278
I am merely offering
His Holiness any help I can

53:32.312 --> 53:34.714
in unmasking the culprit.

53:34.748 --> 53:38.985
Our Holy Mother Church can
afford no such scandals.

53:43.590 --> 53:48.227
We have Orsini's household
staff in irons, Your Holiness.

53:48.262 --> 53:51.731
Cardinal.
The good cardinal, my brother,

53:51.765 --> 53:56.302
has offered to help us unmask
the culprit behind this plot.

53:56.336 --> 53:59.772
We apprehended this wretch
skulking outside by the gate.

53:59.806 --> 54:02.575
A plot, by definition,
needs more than one participant,

54:02.609 --> 54:06.112
does it not?
Do you recognize him?

54:13.453 --> 54:16.455
Didn't he pour the wine?

54:16.490 --> 54:19.592
Do you know
this man, Cardinal Della Rovere?

54:19.626 --> 54:21.861
I know he attended
at the cardinal's table,

54:21.895 --> 54:23.329
but there were many of those.

54:23.363 --> 54:28.501
Beyond that,
nothing.

54:28.535 --> 54:31.537
If this creature is
indeed the poisoner,

54:31.572 --> 54:35.741
some hours on the strappado
should loosen his tongue.

54:35.776 --> 54:37.276
See if he talks.

54:44.351 --> 54:46.519
I have a dilemma:

54:48.822 --> 54:51.324
whether to flay you
at night...

54:53.393 --> 54:55.294
...or at dawn.

54:59.700 --> 55:01.773
I pity you your
dilemma, My Lord.

55:01.798 --> 55:02.935
Pity yourself.

55:02.936 --> 55:06.305
Brother. You have
already exhausted yourself

55:06.340 --> 55:07.807
in our father's defence.

55:07.841 --> 55:10.343
Now I could spend a good hour
questioning this man.

55:10.377 --> 55:12.378
Is that really a task
for a cleric?

55:22.990 --> 55:25.958
Lock the door and go.

55:25.993 --> 55:28.561
Up.

55:28.595 --> 55:30.096
Up!

55:34.668 --> 55:37.136
Would you have talked?

55:37.170 --> 55:40.006
Only to sing your praises,
My Lord.

55:43.844 --> 55:46.512
Still want
to earn my trust?

55:48.515 --> 55:51.317
Eternally, My Lord.

55:51.351 --> 55:54.020
Lie low for a day, then.

55:54.054 --> 55:57.723
I can have word sent out
that you couldn't be broken.

55:59.960 --> 56:02.094
And then?

56:02.129 --> 56:03.996
Then...

56:04.031 --> 56:08.267
...get close to Cardinal
Della Rovere.

56:08.301 --> 56:11.971
Tell me what he thinks.
What he plans.

56:16.643 --> 56:19.145
Then you must hurt me,
My Lord.

56:21.148 --> 56:23.949
Haven't I hurt you
enough already?

56:23.984 --> 56:28.154
To convince this cardinal,
my back must tell its own story.

56:30.824 --> 56:33.125
And I have heard
that he has an interest

56:33.160 --> 56:35.695
in the male torso.

56:38.665 --> 56:43.669
And even I cannot
convincingly whip myself.

56:47.674 --> 56:49.675
So whip me, My Lord.

57:01.054 --> 57:02.922
Harder.

57:07.227 --> 57:08.794
Harder, My Lord.

57:12.466 --> 57:13.999
And...

57:14.034 --> 57:17.803
...if you betray me...

57:19.840 --> 57:22.274
...you will end your days
on that rack.

57:22.309 --> 57:25.444
Then it would not be
in my interest to betray you,

57:25.479 --> 57:28.447
My Lord.
Good.

57:30.250 --> 57:32.251
Again!

57:36.323 --> 57:37.890
Again.

57:48.553 --> 57:52.356
Do you have something
to tell me?

57:52.390 --> 57:54.658
About the night's events?

57:57.495 --> 57:59.496
Only that...

58:01.499 --> 58:03.500
...I will protect you.

58:03.535 --> 58:06.537
Protect our family.

58:06.571 --> 58:09.406
With my life
if needs be.

58:14.512 --> 58:18.816
Well, all of the others bought
and sold.

58:18.850 --> 58:22.453
We merely proved ourselves
better at the game.

58:22.487 --> 58:25.623
But we draw the line

58:25.657 --> 58:29.493
at murder,
do we not?

58:33.665 --> 58:37.701
Orsini drew no such line.

58:45.677 --> 58:47.678
I see.

58:51.683 --> 58:53.784
So,

58:53.818 --> 58:57.121
we are one less cardinal
this morning.

59:03.295 --> 59:06.764
I was your age
when I became a cardinal.

59:06.798 --> 59:08.632
Seems like yesterday.

59:10.635 --> 59:12.169
This red...

59:12.203 --> 59:16.373
...signifies that you are ready
to spill your blood in defence

59:16.408 --> 59:19.610
of the Christian faith.

59:19.644 --> 59:23.147
- No, Father.
- Are you, my son, ready

59:23.181 --> 59:26.450
to spill your blood in defence
of the Christian faith?

59:26.484 --> 59:28.152
I think you are!

59:28.186 --> 59:30.154
For the defence
of my family, perhaps.

59:30.188 --> 59:32.289
- That too.
- Give me control of the

59:32.289 --> 59:33.121
papal armies and
I will protect us all.

59:33.181 --> 59:35.693
We will have one son

59:35.694 --> 59:38.395
in the cloth
and one in armour.

59:38.430 --> 59:41.365
You know our wishes.
But a cardinal's red?

59:41.399 --> 59:43.534
And Lucrezia must marry.

59:43.568 --> 59:45.302
So soon?

59:45.337 --> 59:48.706
- She is 14 years old.
- She is just a child.

59:48.740 --> 59:52.309
We must bind our enemies
to us. Make friends of them.

59:52.344 --> 59:54.945
And what better way is there
than marriage

59:54.980 --> 59:59.383
You can perform the rite--
as cardinal.

59:59.417 --> 01:00:03.320
Am I a cardinal already?

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:14.498
And they tortured you
for...

01:00:14.532 --> 01:00:17.468
...how long?

01:00:17.502 --> 01:00:21.038
A day and a night,
Your Eminence.

01:00:25.477 --> 01:00:26.977
And you revealed?

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.982
There was nothing to reveal,
Your Eminence.

01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:42.192
<i>Ecce homo.</i>

01:00:44.696 --> 01:00:47.931
"Behold the man."

01:00:47.966 --> 01:00:50.501
They scourged
our saviour thus.

01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:58.409
Is it true,
what's being rumoured?

01:00:58.443 --> 01:01:02.780
That the good cardinal
inadvertently poisoned himself?

01:01:02.814 --> 01:01:05.449
Who would have profited
from his death?

01:01:05.483 --> 01:01:07.951
Certainly not
Cardinal Orsini.

01:01:07.986 --> 01:01:09.786
Who takes possession
of his properties?

01:01:09.811 --> 01:01:11.011
Borgia.

01:01:11.923 --> 01:01:13.424
Well, then.

01:01:15.827 --> 01:01:18.295
These methods are
not mine.

01:01:18.329 --> 01:01:21.799
You think they are mine,
Your Eminence?

01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:24.468
What are your methods?

01:01:24.502 --> 01:01:26.637
Discretion.

01:01:26.671 --> 01:01:28.072
Silence.

01:01:28.106 --> 01:01:30.107
And you have suffered
for your silence.

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:35.646
Why?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.915
Like you,

01:01:37.949 --> 01:01:40.818
I hate this Borgia.

01:01:42.854 --> 01:01:45.656
And if I can be
of any use...

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.993
I need someone
I can trust.

01:01:50.028 --> 01:01:53.130
You can trust my hatred
of this Borgia pope.

01:02:01.172 --> 01:02:05.309
I can trust these wounds
of yours.

01:02:10.148 --> 01:02:14.284
They will last
for a lifetime,

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:17.387
Your Eminence.
Indeed.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:22.359
I need to assemble a gathering
of every cardinal

01:02:22.393 --> 01:02:25.796
who shares your feelings.

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.199
In absolute secrecy.

01:02:56.628 --> 01:02:59.296
May I thank you, Holy Father,

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:01.207
for bequeathing to me
your precious time.

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:06.603
Go on, my child.

01:03:06.638 --> 01:03:08.338
I have sinned mightily,

01:03:08.373 --> 01:03:10.674
Your Holiness,

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:14.711
and know there are some sins
that only the pope can forgive.

01:03:14.746 --> 01:03:16.547
They are few,

01:03:16.581 --> 01:03:19.616
but the most grave.

01:03:21.619 --> 01:03:23.153
Tell me.

01:03:25.156 --> 01:03:28.458
My husband,
Your Holiness,

01:03:28.493 --> 01:03:30.961
has long been...

01:03:30.995 --> 01:03:33.497
...distasteful to me.

01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:35.699
I fear...

01:03:35.733 --> 01:03:39.102
...you are not the first woman
to share that fate.

01:03:39.137 --> 01:03:43.207
His person
I find repellent.

01:03:43.241 --> 01:03:46.043
His advances sicken me.

01:03:46.077 --> 01:03:50.080
His hand upon my body makes me
retch with disgust.

01:03:50.114 --> 01:03:55.052
Have you denied him...

01:03:55.086 --> 01:03:57.454
...your duties as a wife?

01:03:59.757 --> 01:04:02.226
No, Your Holiness.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:06.330
I performed them
as the Church says I must.

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:07.831
So I...

01:04:07.865 --> 01:04:10.567
...fail
to discern the sin.

01:04:15.073 --> 01:04:18.542
I found myself
with child.

01:04:18.576 --> 01:04:20.877
The thought
of this body of mine,

01:04:20.912 --> 01:04:23.747
marred by the presence
of his offspring--

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.051
inside--

01:04:28.086 --> 01:04:31.088
drove me to an act
of transgression that...

01:04:35.093 --> 01:04:37.427
Go on, my daughter.

01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:43.600
I put an end
to my pregnancy.

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:48.605
That is indeed
most grave.

01:04:50.608 --> 01:04:52.576
A sin...

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.012
...that only
the pope...

01:04:55.046 --> 01:04:58.382
...can forgive.
Only God may forgive.

01:05:00.385 --> 01:05:03.520
But we may intercede...

01:05:03.554 --> 01:05:06.757
...on your behalf.

01:05:10.662 --> 01:05:13.730
Then, please,
Your Holiness,

01:05:13.765 --> 01:05:17.868
...beg for me His mercy.

01:05:17.902 --> 01:05:20.203
And...

01:05:20.238 --> 01:05:24.207
...your husband?
He knows of this?

01:05:24.242 --> 01:05:26.209
He knows nothing.

01:05:26.244 --> 01:05:30.447
He has retired to his castle
in Bassano.

01:05:30.481 --> 01:05:33.717
He satisfies his lust on me
no longer.

01:05:33.751 --> 01:05:35.652
And you are...

01:05:35.687 --> 01:05:39.956
now... chaste?

01:05:43.394 --> 01:05:45.862
I have no one,
Your Holiness.

01:05:45.897 --> 01:05:49.366
Then perhaps
that is to be your penitence--

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.538
to follow your husband
to Bassano, as is your duty.

01:05:54.572 --> 01:05:57.541
I would prefer a life
of destitution, Your Holiness.

01:05:57.575 --> 01:05:59.543
Then love God.

01:05:59.577 --> 01:06:03.347
And find peace
within the walls of a nunnery.

01:06:03.381 --> 01:06:06.450
Can one find peace
in such a love, Your Holiness?

01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:09.986
It is what we must do,

01:06:10.021 --> 01:06:13.256
Giulia Farnese.

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:21.465
I fear
I may lack Your Holiness's will.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:26.069
I am still young,
Your Holiness,

01:06:26.104 --> 01:06:28.572
and my body, I am sure,

01:06:28.606 --> 01:06:31.241
could find, and give,
much happiness

01:06:31.275 --> 01:06:33.877
if my soul could
find peace.

01:06:38.282 --> 01:06:40.384
Do you beg forgiveness
from God

01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:42.386
for the enormity
of your crime?

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.755
I do so daily.

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:47.591
Your Holiness, my soul yearns
for its punishment.

01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:50.560
Then you must fast.

01:06:50.595 --> 01:06:54.664
From matins
till evensong.

01:06:54.699 --> 01:06:58.001
And flagellate your naked body
twice nightly.

01:06:58.035 --> 01:06:59.803
With knotted cord,

01:06:59.837 --> 01:07:03.874
Your Holiness?
Cord of silk will suffice.

01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:07.544
To destroy the beauty
the Lord has granted you

01:07:07.578 --> 01:07:11.548
would be
to compound your sin.

01:07:11.582 --> 01:07:13.750
<i>E go te absolve...</i>

01:07:13.785 --> 01:07:16.686
<i>...ab omnibus censuris,</i>
<i>et peccatis,</i>

01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:18.855
<i>in nomine Patris,</i>

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:21.091
<i>et Filii,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:23.627
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:35.472
Giulia Farnese.

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:39.276
Your Holiness?

01:07:41.279 --> 01:07:43.747
One of your lineage...

01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:47.217
...to be destitute--
we cannot allow it.

01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:51.922
We must find you...
some...

01:07:51.956 --> 01:07:54.891
...temporary and...

01:07:54.926 --> 01:07:56.927
...temporal refuge.

01:08:05.403 --> 01:08:08.772
Keep the fire
away from the straw!

01:08:08.806 --> 01:08:10.974
- It is!
- Good!

01:08:16.647 --> 01:08:19.158
Boy, keep the banners
and colours all together.

01:08:19.184 --> 01:08:20.384
Right, sir!

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:25.392
Some of you voted
for him,

01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:30.938
for which unfortunate choice
you are now forgiven.

01:08:30.995 --> 01:08:33.630
But most of you voted
against.

01:08:33.663 --> 01:08:35.966
We have assembled the barest
of majorities.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.468
But then,
this Borgia pope was elected

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:41.136
with just such
a majority.

01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:48.645
The cardinal's demise was...
sudden.

01:08:48.679 --> 01:08:51.113
So it seems.

01:08:53.283 --> 01:08:57.554
But his palace is ideal
as a...

01:08:57.587 --> 01:09:01.558
...place
of penitence...

01:09:01.591 --> 01:09:03.593
...and...

01:09:03.627 --> 01:09:05.629
...self-reflection.

01:09:18.975 --> 01:09:23.046
If it can be proven,
what many of us suspect--

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.982
corruption, simony,

01:09:26.017 --> 01:09:29.553
the blatant sale
of the sacred offices,

01:09:29.587 --> 01:09:34.090
and worse, the utter degradation
of the office of the papacy

01:09:34.125 --> 01:09:36.126
in the eyes
of the Christian world...

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:44.301
You must think
of your sojourn here

01:09:44.335 --> 01:09:47.470
as a retreat.

01:09:47.505 --> 01:09:49.005
A retreat?

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:55.679
The cardinal had this tunnel
built.

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:59.683
It leads
inside the Vatican walls.

01:10:04.355 --> 01:10:08.291
If you ever find yourself
in need of...

01:10:08.326 --> 01:10:11.795
...spiritual comfort..

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:15.332
...in your loneliness...
Your Holiness.

01:10:15.366 --> 01:10:19.769
You must not be afraid
to avail of it.

01:10:19.804 --> 01:10:22.005
Day or night.

01:10:27.144 --> 01:10:29.145
We shall leave you now.

01:10:31.482 --> 01:10:34.884
This passage goes
both ways.

01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:38.622
Your Holiness must feel
free to visit...

01:10:38.656 --> 01:10:43.627
...if God's love were ever
to leave him wanting.

01:10:47.698 --> 01:10:50.758
The cardinal summons me
in the dead of night.

01:10:50.783 --> 01:10:52.183
Is there a reason?

01:10:52.837 --> 01:10:56.306
These are turbulent times,
Father.

01:11:03.314 --> 01:11:05.315
<i>Dottore...</i>

01:11:08.552 --> 01:11:10.887
You can leave us now.

01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:19.362
I need advice, <i>dottore,</i>
<i>on a delicate matter.</i>

01:11:19.397 --> 01:11:22.165
The deposition
of a pope.

01:11:24.168 --> 01:11:26.803
Delicate indeed.

01:11:26.837 --> 01:11:30.240
And, if I may say so,
dangerous.

01:13:11.976 --> 01:13:14.511
Stop that.

01:13:16.514 --> 01:13:19.015
You have done penance
enough.

01:13:24.655 --> 01:13:27.791
Who then will forgive us,
Your Holiness?

01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:29.826
God will.

01:14:15.239 --> 01:14:18.374
Huggucio of Pisa states:

01:14:18.409 --> 01:14:23.313
<i>"Ecce publico fornicator,</i>
<i>publico habet concubinem..."</i>

01:14:23.347 --> 01:14:26.883
The pope who publicly fornicates,
publicly keeps a concubine--

01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:29.919
Can indeed be
deposed,

01:14:29.954 --> 01:14:35.992
because to scandalize the Church
is in itself heresy.

01:14:36.026 --> 01:14:40.430
But one would need
firm evidence

01:14:40.464 --> 01:14:43.466
of notorious
and public lechery.

01:14:46.537 --> 01:14:49.806
Whose bed is this?

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.175
Yours,
of course.

01:14:54.612 --> 01:14:56.613
Whose bed was this?

01:15:00.351 --> 01:15:03.453
It belonged to a cardinal
and a fool.

01:15:05.456 --> 01:15:07.624
What kind of fool?

01:15:09.627 --> 01:15:12.695
The kind of fool
who doesn't understand that

01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:15.531
God's work can be done

01:15:15.566 --> 01:15:17.934
even by the most unlikely
of his servants.

01:15:17.968 --> 01:15:21.471
And that Rome needs now is--
You.

01:15:23.974 --> 01:15:25.475
Power.

01:15:30.915 --> 01:15:35.151
You're so beautiful,
Giulia Farnese.

01:15:37.154 --> 01:15:40.156
I would
have you painted.

01:16:09.019 --> 01:16:12.288
- She is beautiful.
- She is.

01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:16.559
More beautiful
than your painting.

01:16:16.593 --> 01:16:21.497
- I've just begun.
- You must do better, then.

01:16:21.532 --> 01:16:24.600
Her hair curls, here.

01:16:27.438 --> 01:16:28.905
Who is she?

01:16:28.939 --> 01:16:31.808
Giulia Farnese.

01:16:31.842 --> 01:16:34.210
At your service.

01:16:34.244 --> 01:16:37.246
Why is he painting you,

01:16:37.281 --> 01:16:39.248
Giulia Farnese?

01:16:39.283 --> 01:16:42.585
Your father, the pope,
commissioned him.

01:16:42.619 --> 01:16:44.387
Will he paint one of me?

01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:46.522
I will commission him, now.

01:16:49.526 --> 01:16:51.494
Why are you holding
a baby goat?

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:54.764
It will become
a unicorn.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:56.799
Then I want a unicorn.

01:17:00.571 --> 01:17:04.107
Or even better,
a sea horse.

01:17:09.213 --> 01:17:13.149
I want to lie on a bed of seashells
and have a sea horse in my lap.

01:17:13.183 --> 01:17:15.051
Like this one?

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:22.458
Yes.

01:17:22.493 --> 01:17:24.894
Just like this one.

01:17:24.928 --> 01:17:26.796
You must have it, then.

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:29.065
I can?

01:17:32.903 --> 01:17:35.538
It's a gift.

01:17:35.572 --> 01:17:39.475
From Giulia
to Lucrezia.

01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:43.679
- Can I kiss you, then?
- Only if we are to be friends.

01:17:43.714 --> 01:17:46.716
We are friends already.

01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:53.990
I am to have
my portrait painted, Mama.

01:17:54.024 --> 01:17:57.326
- You are?
- But I don't want a goat,

01:17:57.361 --> 01:18:02.498
or a unicorn. I told Giulia
I want a sea horse like this one.

01:18:02.533 --> 01:18:05.535
- You told who?
- Giulia Farnese.

01:18:07.538 --> 01:18:10.173
Giulia Farnese is having
her portrait painted?

01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:12.041
By Pinturicchio.

01:18:12.076 --> 01:18:14.477
Papa commissioned him.

01:18:18.382 --> 01:18:20.016
Ah.

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.886
She gave me
this pendant.

01:18:23.921 --> 01:18:27.857
I think a sea horse is better
than a unicorn, don't you Mama?

01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:31.994
I've heard she is beautiful,
this Giulia Farnese.

01:18:35.165 --> 01:18:38.835
- Papa thinks so.
- I am sure he does.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.075
A different type of beauty
to yours, Mama.

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:50.680
Not Spanish.
Italian.

01:18:50.714 --> 01:18:53.916
Her hair is light,
and full of curls.

01:19:00.023 --> 01:19:02.692
And where did you meet her,
Lucrezia?

01:19:04.695 --> 01:19:06.662
In Papa's rooms.

01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:08.698
In the Vatican.

01:19:16.473 --> 01:19:20.176
- Please, My Lady!
- Your Holiness!

01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.677
My dear.

01:19:21.712 --> 01:19:24.847
You told me
that the pope can love God,

01:19:24.882 --> 01:19:26.916
but to be seen
to love anyone else

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:28.818
would be impossible.
Your Holiness--

01:19:28.852 --> 01:19:30.853
- Now, now--
- Shall we remove ourselves?

01:19:30.888 --> 01:19:32.855
That the pope must be
chaste,

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:35.858
and he must be seen
to be chaste.

01:19:35.893 --> 01:19:38.528
Don't you want them to hear?
That you have a new whore?!

01:19:38.562 --> 01:19:40.796
- Mother!
- Farnese!

01:19:40.831 --> 01:19:42.665
- Get out!
- That you've installed her

01:19:42.699 --> 01:19:44.600
in the Orsini Palace?
What?

01:19:44.635 --> 01:19:46.602
- We were--
- Be gone!

01:19:46.637 --> 01:19:49.205
I banished my husband
for your sake!

01:19:49.239 --> 01:19:51.326
You are the mother
of my children!

01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.651
You will always have
a special place in my life.

01:19:52.743 --> 01:19:55.711
- What about your promise?!
- There is no one...

01:19:55.746 --> 01:19:58.047
...no one,
closer to me than you.

01:19:58.081 --> 01:19:59.615
Why her?!

01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:02.351
She was in need!
I had to help her.

01:20:02.386 --> 01:20:05.321
You were destitute once!

01:20:05.355 --> 01:20:07.723
Be gone!
Out!

01:20:07.758 --> 01:20:09.692
We were
in consultation--

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:12.228
Your Grace,
are leaving.

01:20:21.838 --> 01:20:23.839
Don't lie to me.

01:20:23.874 --> 01:20:25.341
To me, you cannot lie.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:27.009
Then don't challenge me.

01:20:27.044 --> 01:20:29.545
And never, ever
within these sacred walls.

01:20:31.548 --> 01:20:35.551
I've dreamed about this room
and what it might do to you.

01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:40.223
We need
a new understanding, then.

01:20:42.226 --> 01:20:44.860
Perhaps.

01:20:44.895 --> 01:20:47.363
I'll keep my peace.

01:20:47.397 --> 01:20:49.732
But I won't be
humiliated.

01:20:52.569 --> 01:20:54.170
I would have peace.

01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:57.640
You commissioned a portrait
of her.

01:20:57.674 --> 01:21:00.109
I shall have
a portrait too

01:21:00.143 --> 01:21:01.978
by the same new genius
you found.

01:21:02.012 --> 01:21:05.114
Pinturicchio.

01:21:05.148 --> 01:21:08.451
He is good,
but he's...

01:21:08.485 --> 01:21:10.953
...expensive.

01:21:10.988 --> 01:21:14.624
All of Rome is yours
for the taking.

01:21:14.658 --> 01:21:17.460
Make sure
he does me justice.

01:21:17.494 --> 01:21:20.496
I was beautiful
once, no?

01:21:22.499 --> 01:21:24.767
You still are.

01:21:24.801 --> 01:21:28.170
We agreed, did we not,
that you would not lie?

01:21:31.041 --> 01:21:35.478
He has placed his new whore
in Orsini's palace, no?

01:21:35.512 --> 01:21:37.647
I believe so,
Your Eminence.

01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:40.783
Question the staff, then,
in secret,

01:21:40.817 --> 01:21:44.820
and in any way
you see fit.

01:21:44.855 --> 01:21:47.356
We need evidence
of lechery,

01:21:47.391 --> 01:21:50.393
fornication--

01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:54.930
<i>publico habet concubinem.</i>

01:21:57.267 --> 01:21:59.435
Get these to the Deacon-
Cardinal for signatures.

01:21:59.469 --> 01:22:00.970
Yes, Your Eminence.

01:22:10.314 --> 01:22:12.782
He has met in secret
with those cardinals

01:22:12.816 --> 01:22:15.618
that hate your father.

01:22:15.652 --> 01:22:17.453
With Johannes Burchard,

01:22:17.487 --> 01:22:19.889
he is making a case
for your father's deposition.

01:22:19.923 --> 01:22:21.557
On what grounds?

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.096
Notorious
and public lechery...

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:30.166
Lechery?
My father?

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.335
God forbid.

01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:33.869
Has he evidence?

01:22:33.904 --> 01:22:37.239
He means to find it.

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:43.813
Then perhaps
we should find it first,

01:22:43.847 --> 01:22:46.282
and silence it
before it speaks.

01:22:48.618 --> 01:22:51.153
Your mother was somewhat
troubled yesterday.

01:22:51.188 --> 01:22:55.958
She finds the change
in our life difficult.

01:22:55.992 --> 01:22:57.960
So I noticed.

01:22:57.994 --> 01:23:00.296
Do what you can
to keep her out of here.

01:23:02.299 --> 01:23:04.767
It would help, maybe,
if you were more discreet

01:23:04.801 --> 01:23:07.269
in your affections.
But I--

01:23:07.304 --> 01:23:09.939
You are aware, Holy Father,
of the plots against you?

01:23:09.973 --> 01:23:13.309
Oh, what would Rome be
without a good plot?

01:23:15.312 --> 01:23:17.780
The College of Cardinals is
split down the middle.

01:23:17.814 --> 01:23:22.151
What? Well, perhaps
we need some more cardinals.

01:23:24.154 --> 01:23:26.622
Johannes Burchard has been
asked for an opinion...

01:23:26.656 --> 01:23:28.991
Dear old Johannes.

01:23:29.025 --> 01:23:32.661
He does give excellent opinion.
On your deposition, Father.

01:23:34.664 --> 01:23:36.165
Indeed.

01:23:36.199 --> 01:23:39.502
There are certain things
I could speak of...

01:23:41.505 --> 01:23:44.473
...for a price.

01:23:44.508 --> 01:23:47.810
Don't worry.
You'll get paid.

01:23:47.844 --> 01:23:49.678
I would need to be.

01:23:51.681 --> 01:23:54.750
I have seen things
within these walls

01:23:54.785 --> 01:23:59.088
that would shock a brace
of courtesans.

01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:02.124
Well, now, there's no need
to shock a courtesan, is there?

01:24:02.159 --> 01:24:06.328
A brace of cardinals,
perhaps.

01:24:20.577 --> 01:24:24.914
You were asked
for a judgement, I believe,

01:24:24.948 --> 01:24:30.152
some nights ago?
Your Holiness, as an expert

01:24:30.187 --> 01:24:33.989
on canon law, when asked for
a judgement, I must provide it.

01:24:34.024 --> 01:24:36.392
Please sit.

01:24:40.397 --> 01:24:42.898
I would have
your opinion, then,

01:24:42.933 --> 01:24:47.203
dear Johannes,
on the expansion

01:24:47.237 --> 01:24:49.905
of the College
of Cardinals.

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:54.243
It is the pope's prerogative
to appoint whom he wishes,

01:24:54.277 --> 01:24:56.512
Your Holiness.
To whatever number he wishes?

01:24:56.546 --> 01:24:58.481
Ah, well,

01:24:58.515 --> 01:25:01.016
how many cardinals did
His Holiness have in mind?

01:25:01.051 --> 01:25:05.387
How many would be needed
to make it safe for our papacy?

01:25:11.161 --> 01:25:13.429
- Oh, dear.
- Come, come, Johannes.

01:25:13.463 --> 01:25:17.132
You must be aware of the plots
against us?

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:19.568
You could even,
if viewed with an unkind eye,

01:25:19.603 --> 01:25:22.238
be seen to be party
to them.

01:25:22.272 --> 01:25:25.140
When asked for an opinion,
Your Holiness, you know

01:25:25.175 --> 01:25:27.142
that I must
provide it.

01:25:27.177 --> 01:25:31.480
Ah. So,
your opinion, then.

01:25:31.515 --> 01:25:36.852
How many new cardinals
to preserve our papacy?

01:25:36.887 --> 01:25:39.688
Umm...

01:25:43.293 --> 01:25:47.162
A baker's dozen, I would say.
Mm!

01:25:47.197 --> 01:25:49.198
Thirteen!

01:25:51.201 --> 01:25:55.237
And we can appoint them
all at once?

01:25:55.272 --> 01:25:58.107
Without the vote
of conclave?

01:25:58.141 --> 01:26:00.743
Such a great number would need
a precedent.

01:26:00.777 --> 01:26:02.978
Oh.

01:26:04.981 --> 01:26:08.117
Find one, then.

01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:11.086
Your Holiness.

01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:13.088
I have received advice

01:26:13.123 --> 01:26:17.626
from our most supreme expert
in canon law,

01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:20.796
that a pope's election may be
overturned

01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:23.799
if we can provide evidence
of lechery,

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:26.869
both notorious and public.

01:26:26.903 --> 01:26:29.505
That evidence
I present to you now.

01:26:44.354 --> 01:26:46.221
Leave us, Micheletto.

01:26:52.529 --> 01:26:55.931
And now, my dear,

01:26:55.966 --> 01:26:58.434
tell us
what you have witnessed.

01:26:58.468 --> 01:27:03.105
There is a passage, connecting
the palace to the Vatican.

01:27:03.139 --> 01:27:07.409
His Holiness makes use
of it... nightly.

01:27:07.444 --> 01:27:09.745
And then?

01:27:09.779 --> 01:27:15.084
He enters her bedroom
while she chastises herself.

01:27:15.118 --> 01:27:19.455
And I blush to even describe
what happens next.

01:27:19.489 --> 01:27:21.223
Spare us nothing.

01:27:21.257 --> 01:27:24.727
I wanted seashells
and a sea horse.

01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:26.729
But you have a sea horse,
my love.

01:27:26.763 --> 01:27:29.098
No, I mean a real one.
Like your goat.

01:27:29.132 --> 01:27:33.268
But real sea horses are tiny,
my love.

01:27:33.303 --> 01:27:36.939
- Am I your love?
- I would dearly love you to be.

01:27:36.973 --> 01:27:39.942
My mother hates you.

01:27:39.976 --> 01:27:42.011
You will learn, my dear,

01:27:42.045 --> 01:27:45.814
as women, we control
so little of our destiny.

01:27:45.849 --> 01:27:48.450
Men do.
And?

01:27:48.485 --> 01:27:52.888
The outcome is,
we hate each other.

01:27:52.922 --> 01:27:56.058
But we should not.
Who should we hate, then?

01:27:56.092 --> 01:27:59.928
Men?
No, my love.

01:27:59.963 --> 01:28:03.565
It's in our nature
to love them.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.236
But we should protect ourselves
against them.

01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:10.406
Against our feelings
towards them.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.575
We will all of us,
one day, be replaced.

01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:16.045
Are you giving me
instruction?

01:28:16.079 --> 01:28:19.648
- Would you like me to?
- I think I would.

01:28:21.651 --> 01:28:25.209
What weapons do I have with
which to protect myself?

01:28:25.255 --> 01:28:28.190
Your beauty.

01:28:28.215 --> 01:28:29.415
- Is that a weapon?
- It can be deadly,

01:28:29.659 --> 01:28:31.593
when well used.

01:28:31.628 --> 01:28:35.397
But beauty doesn't last
forever.

01:28:35.432 --> 01:28:38.434
Gone, like the snows
of last year.

01:28:38.468 --> 01:28:41.470
- What else?
- When beauty fades?

01:28:43.473 --> 01:28:44.940
Your wit.

01:28:44.974 --> 01:28:47.109
Your intelligence.

01:28:47.143 --> 01:28:50.913
- And I have those weapons?
- Oh, in abundance.

01:28:50.947 --> 01:28:56.218
You should cultivate them.
You will be married some day.

01:28:56.252 --> 01:29:01.924
You may need them--
sooner than you think.

01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:05.027
Is she pretty,
this piece of evidence?

01:29:05.061 --> 01:29:07.830
She has her charms,
My Lord.

01:29:07.864 --> 01:29:10.933
Perhaps you could see
that she takes a vow of silence.

01:29:13.269 --> 01:29:15.604
Would God forgive us,
Micheletto?

01:29:17.607 --> 01:29:19.742
I know not the ways of God,
My Lord.

01:29:19.776 --> 01:29:22.144
But you know the ways
of silence.

01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:28.050
And we decree
bullfighting will be permitted

01:29:28.084 --> 01:29:32.855
within the walls of Rome
on public festivals

01:29:32.889 --> 01:29:35.691
and the last Thursday
of every month.

01:29:38.061 --> 01:29:41.864
And, finally,

01:29:41.898 --> 01:29:45.567
the main business
to hand.

01:29:45.602 --> 01:29:48.704
Cardinal Della Rovere needs
no staff today, understand?

01:29:48.738 --> 01:29:51.807
For a day of meditation, he has
requested peace and silence.

01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:53.809
You can tell the others.

01:29:56.212 --> 01:29:58.013
Have you not heard?

01:29:58.047 --> 01:30:00.349
His Eminence needs no staff
today.

01:30:00.383 --> 01:30:02.669
It is a day of meditation.

01:30:02.694 --> 01:30:04.594
- He has much on his mind.
- Too much, some might say.

01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:08.724
Such is the burden of great
office. Until tomorrow, my friend.

01:30:10.727 --> 01:30:12.761
We wish
to announce our decision

01:30:12.796 --> 01:30:15.564
to expand the College
of Cardinals,

01:30:15.598 --> 01:30:19.401
in view of the crippling
workload placed upon it

01:30:19.435 --> 01:30:21.870
by our restructuring

01:30:21.905 --> 01:30:25.073
of the affairs
of our Holy Mother Church.

01:30:27.076 --> 01:30:31.046
Thirteen new servants of God...

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.582
...will receive
the cardinal's biretta.

01:30:33.616 --> 01:30:36.318
Thirteen?!

01:30:36.352 --> 01:30:38.053
We have judged it wise

01:30:38.087 --> 01:30:42.825
to strengthen the College
of Cardinals, given the enemies

01:30:42.859 --> 01:30:45.327
who have wormed their way
within the Church of Rome.

01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:47.329
This is against all
precedence.

01:30:47.363 --> 01:30:50.766
His Holiness will fill
the College with his favourites.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.070
I accuse His Holiness--
Ohhh! Of what are we now accused?

01:30:55.104 --> 01:30:57.506
Of an offence
against canon law.

01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.843
Against the Law
of our Holy Mother Church.

01:31:00.877 --> 01:31:04.980
Canon law?
But we have taken advice

01:31:05.014 --> 01:31:09.718
from the most eminent
of all of our canon lawyers.

01:31:26.736 --> 01:31:28.537
Apple...

01:31:28.571 --> 01:31:30.806
...or peach?

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.575
Peach, I think.

01:31:37.747 --> 01:31:39.414
I like peach.

01:31:43.086 --> 01:31:44.853
Eat it all.

01:31:46.856 --> 01:31:51.393
The Council of Constance is
most clear on this matter.

01:31:51.427 --> 01:31:54.096
I refer you to Statute 42,
Paragraph 3--

01:31:54.130 --> 01:31:55.998
In brief, I pray.

01:31:58.001 --> 01:32:01.403
His Holiness, the pope, may
expand the College

01:32:01.437 --> 01:32:03.705
to any number
he deems appropriate,

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.874
if the burden of work
necessitates--

01:32:05.909 --> 01:32:07.542
I challenge him
to name them now!

01:32:07.577 --> 01:32:09.811
Your Holiness.

01:32:09.846 --> 01:32:11.847
Oh...

01:32:11.881 --> 01:32:15.517
<i>Dottore,</i> if you would be
so kind.

01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:20.055
And His Holiness
comes behind the Lady Giulia

01:32:20.089 --> 01:32:23.792
thus!
With the force of a stallion.

01:32:27.597 --> 01:32:29.064
The Bishop of Lucca,

01:32:29.098 --> 01:32:32.734
His Grace Fiorentini, will be
named Cardinal Fiorentini.

01:32:32.769 --> 01:32:36.033
The Bishop of Naples,
His Grace Giovanni Mascoli,

01:32:36.058 --> 01:32:37.239
will be named Cardinal Mascoli.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.042
The Bishop of Valencia,
His Grace

01:32:40.076 --> 01:32:43.512
Cesare Borgia, will be
named Cardinal Borgia.

01:32:43.546 --> 01:32:47.916
The pope would make his son
a cardinal?

01:32:47.951 --> 01:32:51.553
I warn you, I have evidence
that will bring this house

01:32:51.587 --> 01:32:54.790
crashing down around your ears.
Evidence?

01:32:54.824 --> 01:33:00.595
Of lechery, transgressions,
both public and notorious!

01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:02.731
Why, then, Cardinal,

01:33:02.765 --> 01:33:04.466
you must present it.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.635
I will!

01:33:18.648 --> 01:33:22.751
The... Bishop of Lyon...

01:33:27.857 --> 01:33:30.425
Though whether the Holy Father
is as virile as you...

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.194
Surely he is.

01:33:32.228 --> 01:33:33.895
Only God can tell.

01:33:39.569 --> 01:33:42.070
A candle,
if you please!

01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:47.175
Where is everyone?

01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:55.851
Is there nobody about?

01:34:03.026 --> 01:34:04.826
Dear Lord,

01:34:04.861 --> 01:34:07.829
I pray for your strength
and guidance

01:34:07.864 --> 01:34:10.665
in the trials to come.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.135
Give us some sign

01:34:13.169 --> 01:34:15.670
that Rome will be purified,

01:34:15.705 --> 01:34:18.540
the Borgia stain will be
banished forever--

01:34:29.886 --> 01:34:32.554
Guards! Guards!

01:34:34.991 --> 01:34:36.958
Somebody!

01:34:36.993 --> 01:34:39.127
Anybody!

01:34:39.162 --> 01:34:40.662
Help!

01:35:03.052 --> 01:35:06.021
Was the good cardinal known
for lechery?

01:35:06.055 --> 01:35:08.557
He was discreet
in his affections, My Lord.

01:35:08.591 --> 01:35:11.593
So discreet,
indeed,

01:35:11.627 --> 01:35:16.331
he asked me to clear the house
of servants yesterday.

01:35:16.365 --> 01:35:20.335
He must have had
lecherous intentions, then.

01:35:20.369 --> 01:35:23.772
But I'm... shocked
that they ended in murder.

01:35:23.806 --> 01:35:25.774
And now he's fled,
My Lord.

01:35:25.808 --> 01:35:30.745
I would recommend discretion
in this matter.

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:33.482
The Church of Rome can
ill afford another scandal.

01:35:36.719 --> 01:35:40.021
Perhaps he desired
her silence, My Lord.

01:35:40.056 --> 01:35:44.559
He must have.
Poor girl...

01:35:44.594 --> 01:35:47.429
Whom can one trust,
in this Rome of ours?

01:35:47.463 --> 01:35:50.532
I believe trust needs
to be earned, My Lord.

01:35:50.566 --> 01:35:52.667
Perhaps.

01:35:54.670 --> 01:35:56.671
And perhaps it has been.
