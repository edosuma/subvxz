[Baloo] Look, I'm sorry, Becky.

01:02.959 --> 01:05.417
How many times do I have to say it?

01:05.500 --> 01:09.000
[Rebecca] For what you did,
1,000 times wouldn't be enough.

01:09.083 --> 01:12.875
You gave the keys to my car
to a complete stranger.

01:12.959 --> 01:16.208
Well, the guy was dressed
like a parking valet.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.208
How could I know he was a thief?

01:18.291 --> 01:21.041
You should have asked him
for some credentials.

01:21.125 --> 01:25.041
Credentials?
Like what, a badge?

01:25.125 --> 01:27.166
The guy parks cars.

01:27.250 --> 01:32.750
-Anyway, I got the car back.
-[Rebecca] In how many pieces?

01:32.834 --> 01:37.834
Face it, Baloo, you're too gullible.
I'd never be fooled like that.

01:37.917 --> 01:39.792
No possible way.

01:39.875 --> 01:42.709
Jack Case is the name.
Spying's my game.

01:43.792 --> 01:47.667
-But that's hush-hush, you know
-A spy?

01:47.750 --> 01:50.542
How'd you know?
Are you an enemy agent...?

01:50.625 --> 01:52.250
Who sent you?
Who do you work for?

01:52.333 --> 01:54.375
I run this place.

01:54.458 --> 01:58.417
OK, just the person I want to see.
I need a plane. I need a pilot.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.500
I'm on a mission... totally hush-hush.

02:01.583 --> 02:04.583
I get this box to a certain place,
by a certain time,

02:04.667 --> 02:08.166
-or we're talking certain disaster.
-You certain?

02:08.250 --> 02:12.000
Certainly. It's a matter of importance
to the government.

02:12.083 --> 02:16.792
The government?
Ooh, how patriotic.

02:16.875 --> 02:21.667
-Yes. But you didn't hear it from me.
-Of course not. Mum's the word.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.375
Now, um, let me check our schedule.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.542
What do you know?
We have an opening.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.542
Excuse us a sec.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.834
Are you nuts?
We aren't going to fly this guy.

02:32.917 --> 02:35.125
We don't even know if he's really a spy.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.375
Baloo! He says he is.

02:37.458 --> 02:41.166
Well, fine,
then have him show you his credentials.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.667
Credentials?
Like what, a badge?

02:44.750 --> 02:47.250
The guy's a secret agent.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.542
They're probably all written
in invisible ink.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.375
Oh, brother.

02:51.417 --> 02:55.458
Mr. Case, you've got yourself an airplane.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.500
[Baloo] So, where are we headed, hot shot?

02:58.583 --> 03:01.792
-That's a secret.
-Secret, shmeecret.

03:01.875 --> 03:05.542
At least tell me where we're going.
I am the one flying this plane.

03:05.625 --> 03:08.583
Sorry, but
that's on a need-to-know basis.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.250
Right. I need to know.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.542
Look, you fly me in, I swap this package
for another just like it,

03:14.625 --> 03:16.166
and you fly me out.
Got it?

03:16.250 --> 03:17.917
[Baloo] In where?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Your directions sound mighty close
to the border of Thembria.

03:22.083 --> 03:25.083
Actually, they're over
the border of Thembria.

03:26.166 --> 03:29.083
Are you out of your pointy-eareded gourd?

03:29.166 --> 03:31.917
You don't just
flit into Thembria unannounced!

03:32.000 --> 03:33.375
I'm not worried.

03:33.458 --> 03:34.542
[thuds]

03:34.625 --> 03:36.875
Well, that makes one of us.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.166
What's making that noise?

03:39.250 --> 03:41.792
If I'm not mistaken, a piano.

03:41.875 --> 03:45.375
Thembrians like to get your attention
with large objects.

03:45.458 --> 03:51.417
You're in a restricted Thembrian airspace.
I order you to pull over, immediately.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.208
Oh, dear, they mean business.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.041
With a capital biz.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.500
[thud]

04:06.125 --> 04:07.291
What are we going to do?

04:07.375 --> 04:11.792
Well, why don't you ask old spy boy.
He's got all the answers.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.709
Right. Jack.

04:13.792 --> 04:16.583
Uh, Jack, what should we... do?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.250
Jack!

04:18.333 --> 04:23.250
Sorry, Rebecca, I've got to go.
It's for the good of the mission.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.125
Well, what about us?

04:25.208 --> 04:28.542
Rebecca, they may capture you,
they may torture you,

04:28.625 --> 04:31.875
they may subject you to pain
beyond human endurance.

04:31.959 --> 04:36.333
If they do, I want you
to remember just one thing.

04:36.417 --> 04:39.709
-Yes, Jack?
-Mum's the word!

04:47.542 --> 04:52.000
-Well?
-He sorta stepped out for a minute.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.667
-Pitiful.
-[thud]

04:53.750 --> 04:56.375
Oops. We can't hang around here anymore.
Hold on!

04:56.458 --> 04:58.375
[Rebecca yelling]

04:58.458 --> 05:01.208
Squad, attack!

05:06.709 --> 05:08.625
Whew!
[yelps]

05:12.458 --> 05:16.250
-You are big woman!
-Your father milked chicken for a living!

05:25.875 --> 05:26.959
Mama!

05:31.709 --> 05:34.542
[chuckles]
That showed him a thing or three.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.625
Whoa! More company coming.

05:36.709 --> 05:40.166
[Rebecca yells]
Now look what you've done!

05:40.250 --> 05:43.333
[Baloo] Me? Wasn't my secret plan!

05:46.291 --> 05:50.583
[Rebecca] Now, remember, Baloo,
don't say a word about you know what...

05:51.208 --> 05:52.834
or you know who.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.458
Because you know why.

05:54.542 --> 05:58.834
[Baloo] How could I? I don't even know
what you're talking about.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.959
[Spigot] Oh, ignominious intruders.

06:02.041 --> 06:05.875
You'll tremble before me,
as well you should,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.583
for I am Colonel Spigot!

06:08.667 --> 06:10.166
Perhaps you've heard of me?

06:10.250 --> 06:12.333
No, I can't say that I have.

06:12.417 --> 06:16.208
Spigot, Tyrant of the New Territories,

06:16.291 --> 06:20.959
Beast of the Battle of Buldoon,
Death-dealing Demon of Dinswipe!

06:21.041 --> 06:24.959
-Oh, you do plumbing, right?
-Wrong! No...

06:25.041 --> 06:26.542
Do I get another hint?

06:26.625 --> 06:28.625
[grumbling]

06:30.667 --> 06:32.500
-[Rebecca] Oh!
-Dunder!

06:32.583 --> 06:33.583
Sir.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.750
Show him my resume.

06:37.834 --> 06:40.291
Oh-ho. That Spigot.

06:40.375 --> 06:45.166
Confess! Are you not here to disrupt
the... glorious Slush Festival,

06:45.250 --> 06:49.166
of which I am in charge
of the Slush Parade?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.792
Slush Parade?

06:50.875 --> 06:54.417
Now, listen, Spiggy,
this is all a big misunderstanding.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.125
Some idiot hired us to fly him in--
Ow!

06:58.208 --> 07:01.208
Zip it, Baloo.
Jack said not to tell them anything!

07:01.750 --> 07:05.083
We have nothing to say, especially about
the box Jack was carrying.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.417
Box?! What box?

07:06.500 --> 07:07.917
My lips are sealed.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.792
-It's not a bomb, is it?
-I'm not saying.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.417
Not a word.
You won't get anything from me.

07:15.625 --> 07:19.000
Ha! But I already have...

07:19.083 --> 07:23.291
By refusing to say it wasn't a bomb
when I asked you if it was,

07:23.375 --> 07:25.834
you thought you tricked me
into thinking you were lying.

07:25.917 --> 07:28.709
Thus, I presume it wasn't a bomb.

07:28.792 --> 07:32.500
Therefore, the answer is as plain as...
[mumbles]

07:32.583 --> 07:36.417
-Which is, pray tell?
-That it is a bomb!

07:36.500 --> 07:40.834
-Otherwise, you would've said it was.
-Amazing deduction.

07:40.917 --> 07:44.041
Thank you. [chuckles]
To the dungeons with them.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.667
[Rebecca]
Hey, I didn't say anything.

07:50.125 --> 07:51.625
[glass shattering]

08:00.875 --> 08:01.709
Uh-oh.

08:01.792 --> 08:05.792
And make sure the prisoners' plane
is stored away as evidence.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.291
[Dunder] Of course, colonel.

08:07.375 --> 08:12.959
Remember, men, inspect those gifts as if
your lives depended on it, 'cause they do.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.250
One of those boxes is a bomb.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.250
[fanfare plays]

08:17.333 --> 08:21.250
-The high marshal.
-Do I know this person?

08:21.333 --> 08:25.041
-He' the head of your air force.
-Didn't I have him shot?

08:25.125 --> 08:28.792
-Not yet.
-I am at your service, sir.

08:28.875 --> 08:34.417
-Oh, yes, um, Nozzle.
-Uh, that's Spigot, sir.

08:35.332 --> 08:39.166
Of course, I've often thought about
changing my name to Nozzle.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.667
Good.
Do you know my wife?

08:41.750 --> 08:43.542
[snort]

08:44.583 --> 08:48.417
Madam high marshal,
you were never lovelier.

08:49.125 --> 08:52.959
-I wasn't?
-Except for the last time I saw you.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.792
And the time before that.
Actually, you're always lovely.

08:55.875 --> 08:57.834
Mmm...

08:58.291 --> 09:02.375
I trust there will be no incidents
at the Slush Festival,

09:02.458 --> 09:05.500
nothing like that bomb last year.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.417
A bomb? This year?

09:07.500 --> 09:12.500
Oh, high marshal, you have my word
that everything will be perfect.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.125
[high marshal]
Good. Otherwise you'll be shot.

09:15.208 --> 09:19.166
Boy, getting my package in there's
going to be a lot tougher than I thought.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.709
It's not fair.
I have an MBA.

09:22.792 --> 09:25.834
I shouldn't be sitting in some dungeon
with slime and vermin.

09:25.917 --> 09:28.083
Hey, don't blame me.

09:28.166 --> 09:33.083
It was your spysey-wisey that got you here
with his secret mumbo-jumbo.

09:33.166 --> 09:37.417
Jack is on a mission for the government?
Can't you understand?

09:37.500 --> 09:40.542
I understand.
I just don't believe.

09:40.625 --> 09:43.250
I don't think he's a real spy.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.125
Oh? Well, how do you explain
his trench coat?

09:47.208 --> 09:49.709
Huh?
That's a spy's trench coat.

09:49.792 --> 09:52.458
Oh, dazzling logic.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.709
You and Spigot go to the same school?

09:54.792 --> 09:56.875
[Rebecca]
Oh, insults now?

09:56.959 --> 09:59.166
[snoring]
Huh?

09:59.250 --> 10:03.792
Why, if Jack were here, he'd probably
have some spyish way to get us out,

10:03.875 --> 10:07.750
like an exploding pen,
or an exploding screwdriver, or...

10:07.834 --> 10:08.709
[banging on door]

10:08.792 --> 10:12.792
Will you two keep it down?
I'm trying to get some sleep.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.959
Or maybe a handy-dandy spoon?

10:22.709 --> 10:27.500
Hut two! Hut two! Hut two! Hut two!
Hut two, three, four.

[alarm blaring]

10:37.083 --> 10:39.458
Gee, that was fun.

10:39.542 --> 10:42.291
Now we just gotta get
the <i>Sea Duck </i> and get out of here.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.125
-[footsteps approaching]
-Somebody's coming.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.333
It's a dead end!

10:51.417 --> 10:53.000
[Jack] Don't move!

10:58.458 --> 11:01.083
-[Rebecca] Hold it, buster!
-It's me, Jack Case.

11:01.166 --> 11:05.500
Jack! What a guy! What a spy!

11:05.583 --> 11:08.375
What a lie.
Goodbye.

11:08.458 --> 11:09.709
Wait! Wait, wait!

11:09.959 --> 11:13.333
-Look, I shouldn't tell you this--
-Well, then please don't.

11:13.417 --> 11:18.667
But I've had to revise the game plan.
I'm gonna need your help. Hush-hush.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.208
Sorry. All out of help.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.291
But the mission...
the secret mission...

11:23.375 --> 11:26.458
Hush-hush, mum's the word,
government and all that.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.875
I don't even think there is a mission.

11:28.959 --> 11:31.041
If you want to know what I do think--

11:31.125 --> 11:33.750
Baloo, this isn't a debate!

11:33.834 --> 11:38.208
Jack says he's a spy,
which means I say he's a spy,

11:38.291 --> 11:41.333
which means we're helping him
finish the mission.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.542
Oh, here we go again.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.125
-[accordion plays]
-[Rebecca] Ow!

11:49.208 --> 11:51.417
Watch where you're sticking
that accordion!

11:51.500 --> 11:53.500
[Jack]
Sorry, trying to be a little more secret.

11:53.583 --> 11:56.417
-Shh...
-[Rebecca] These clothes look ridiculous.

11:56.500 --> 12:01.208
Sorry, Rebecca, but disguise
is a mainstay for all us spy-types.

12:01.291 --> 12:06.083
Man, I just don't know how gals
get around in these things.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.417
And then once the floats go by,

12:25.500 --> 12:28.959
you open all these lovely gifts
from around the world.

12:29.041 --> 12:32.625
[yawns]
I'd rather be ice fishing.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.208
Cancel the festival.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.166
But your high marshal, I've worked...

12:37.250 --> 12:40.583
I mean, the people
have worked so hard on this.

12:40.667 --> 12:44.792
Nozzle, every year,
it's the same Slush Festival:

12:44.875 --> 12:48.208
The same dull play,
the same dull presents.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.959
The people are always bored,
and there's always a bomb.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.792
I was hoping for more from you.

12:53.959 --> 12:55.166
Tsk, tsk.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.375
No, please, sir!

12:57.458 --> 13:00.333
I promise this year will be special.

13:00.417 --> 13:01.583
[door opens]

13:01.667 --> 13:03.083
[grunting]

13:03.166 --> 13:04.709
Huh?

13:04.792 --> 13:08.583
-As promised, here we are.
-We?

13:08.667 --> 13:13.000
The special entertainment you hired
for the Slush Festival, of course.

13:13.083 --> 13:17.000
Of course. See?
It's special already.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.709
Do I know you from somewhere?

13:18.792 --> 13:23.291
Oh, I bet you say that to all the girls.

13:23.375 --> 13:27.417
And we cannot hardly wait
for the Slush Festival to begin.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.834
-In fact, we are so excited, hey!
-[both] Hey!

13:31.917 --> 13:33.792
We feel like dancing.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.959
A one, and a two.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.458
[upbeat music playing]

13:42.792 --> 13:47.625
Oh, yeah.
Don't you just love those native rhythms?

14:04.625 --> 14:07.583
-One diversion, as ordered.
-On my way.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.750
Sorry.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.375
We're out of here.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.500
[grunts]

14:46.583 --> 14:49.250
-You got the package?
-Roger.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.125
Then let's get the plane.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.834
Taxi!

15:03.041 --> 15:04.041
[burps]

15:06.625 --> 15:07.667
[yells]

15:09.166 --> 15:10.000
[grunts]

15:13.750 --> 15:14.834
I'll take it from here.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.000
[Baloo]
You ever driven one of these?

15:17.083 --> 15:20.083
-[Jack] No, but remember, I'm a--
-Spy.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.000
Yeah, you've told us a million times.

15:23.083 --> 15:26.458
Then spies know all about
these sort of things.

15:55.667 --> 15:59.041
Where'd you learn that trick,
some secret agent handbook?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.291
Trust me.
I'm in total control.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.333
[Baloo]
Total control, huh?

16:07.583 --> 16:09.834
There's my baby.

16:13.834 --> 16:17.208
-I think you owe me an apology.
-An apology?

16:17.291 --> 16:19.125
[scoffs] What for?

16:19.208 --> 16:22.542
Well, it's quite obvious
that Jack really is a spy.

16:22.625 --> 16:26.750
I was right, and now we've just helped
the government on a secret mission.

16:26.834 --> 16:31.542
-So there!
-[Jack] No! No! No! Not again!

16:31.625 --> 16:35.542
-Not fair! Not fair!
-Jack, what's the matter?

16:35.625 --> 16:40.750
It's the wrong box.
We have to go back again!

16:47.417 --> 16:51.750
Now, Jack, I'm sure all secret agents
have their little setbacks.

16:51.834 --> 16:56.291
-My boss is gonna kill me.
-I can save him the trouble.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.500
You're not helping.
Where's your patriotism, Baloo?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.542
I don't know.
On vacation?

17:01.625 --> 17:06.333
This box obviously contains
important secrets, vital plans,

17:06.416 --> 17:08.416
and crucial...

17:10.500 --> 17:11.583
[screams]

17:11.666 --> 17:13.165
Worms!

17:13.666 --> 17:16.916
Shh! Quiet! Hush-hush!
Don't tell anyone.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.750
They're trained worms, right?
They carry microfilm? They explode?

17:20.834 --> 17:23.165
Jack, tell me
they're not just plain worms.

17:23.250 --> 17:28.458
They're not just plain worms,
they're very expensive fishing worms.

17:28.541 --> 17:31.542
But why would a spy carry fishing worms?

17:31.625 --> 17:35.917
I'm not a spy, I'm just a mailman.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.083
But the trench coat!

17:39.625 --> 17:42.333
Would you have helped me
if I said I was a postal worker?

17:42.417 --> 17:45.959
-You should've asked for credentials.
-Talk!

17:46.041 --> 17:47.875
My boss had me mail two boxes:

17:47.959 --> 17:50.291
one was for his wife,
the other to the high marshal.

17:50.375 --> 17:55.792
-You see, the high marshal likes to fish.
-And you sent the wrong package.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.792
She was supposed to get a jewelry box

17:57.875 --> 18:00.959
with little frills
and a toy ballerina on top.

18:01.041 --> 18:05.875
We've been risking our necks
over a can of worms and a jewelry box?

18:05.959 --> 18:09.750
Ever hear of the phrase,
"Told you so?"

18:09.834 --> 18:12.375
You stay out of this
and start the plane.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.417
You, in here.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.917
[Jack] But I got to switch those boxes.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.125
The high marshal wants fishing stuff.

18:19.208 --> 18:23.083
When he opens the wrong box and that
ballerina pops out, he'll be insulted!

18:23.166 --> 18:25.959
-He'll be enraged!
-That's your problem!

18:26.083 --> 18:27.333
Let's get out of here.

18:27.417 --> 18:32.917
How? With the Slush Parade going on,
the <i>Sea Duck </i> will be a sitting duck.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.750
Unless you've got some way
of getting us through secretly.

18:37.834 --> 18:42.500
Why, yes.
That's exactly how we're going to do it.

18:47.375 --> 18:50.875
Welcome back to our coverage
of the Slush Festival.

18:50.959 --> 18:56.208
As you can hear, the crowd
can hardly contain its excitement!

18:56.417 --> 18:57.709
-Yay.
-Yay.

18:57.792 --> 19:00.917
I can see from here
how much our glorious leader,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.917
the high marshal, is enjoying this.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.709
[yawns]

19:16.375 --> 19:18.667
[announcer]
And there goes the final float,

19:18.750 --> 19:22.166
a salute to frostbite! What a show!

19:22.250 --> 19:25.333
And now for the annual opening
of the presents and...

19:25.417 --> 19:28.792
Wait, here's another float!

19:33.500 --> 19:36.375
See? Isn't this working out nicely?

19:36.500 --> 19:39.959
We just keep a low profile,
and before you know it...

19:42.125 --> 19:45.250
[Jack] Wait, don't go.
I have to switch those packages!

19:47.333 --> 19:48.834
Turn it off!

19:48.917 --> 19:52.208
Too late.
You blew our cover, literally.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.166
Well, well... What do we do?

19:54.291 --> 19:57.792
-Get away as fast as we can.
-Good idea.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.709
[guns cocking]

19:59.792 --> 20:02.625
Tanks!
We're done for.

20:02.709 --> 20:07.625
-We need us a diversion.
-What we need is a secret agent.

20:07.709 --> 20:13.041
-Didn't you already learn that lesson?
-I did, but they didn't.

20:16.667 --> 20:20.917
Is this another
of your special events, Schnozzle?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.792
Yes... I mean, no.

20:22.875 --> 20:27.458
Come on, guys, you've got to let me...
[yells]

20:27.542 --> 20:29.125
[grunts]

20:31.291 --> 20:35.250
Yes! High marshal,
I have something for you!

20:35.333 --> 20:40.417
He wanted to be a spy.
Look, everyone! A spy!

20:40.500 --> 20:42.917
[all] Huh?

20:44.917 --> 20:47.667
That better not be a bomb, Nozzle.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.166
Stop that man!
Please?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.583
Mr. High Marshal!

20:53.083 --> 20:54.166
Now's our chance.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.166
[all yelling]

21:05.875 --> 21:08.458
[all exclaiming]

21:15.083 --> 21:17.000
Nice touch, Nozzle.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.625
The peasants actually liked it.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.667
Oh, thank you, high marshal.

21:22.750 --> 21:27.750
But I'm not a spy, honest!
Just ask them!

21:27.834 --> 21:29.709
Ask them!

21:30.583 --> 21:35.166
"The high marshal, seen here accepting
his favorite gift of the festival,

21:35.250 --> 21:37.667
an ornamental fishing tackle box."

21:37.750 --> 21:40.375
Well, don't that beat all?

21:40.458 --> 21:44.625
The guy didn't even know
it was supposed to be a jewelry box.

21:44.709 --> 21:47.417
See? Everything turned out fine.

21:47.500 --> 21:52.083
Woulda turned out finer if we hadn't
of gone through it in the first place.

21:52.166 --> 21:55.458
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

21:55.542 --> 22:01.125
Oh, only another, uh, 672 more times.

22:01.208 --> 22:04.625
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

22:04.709 --> 22:09.625
-I just love how that sounds.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
