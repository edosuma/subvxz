WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.837
Okay, l'm gonna order us some drinks.
What can l get you?

00:05.005 --> 00:08.174
Anything blue. Or yellow.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.884
On the off chance they don't have either,

00:09.968 --> 00:11.719
is there another primary color
l can get for you?

00:12.763 --> 00:13.888
Pink.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.057
Be right back.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.101
How's your date going?

00:18.435 --> 00:24.023
She would like a blue drink
or a yellow drink or a pink drink.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.360
You want me to put it in a sippy cup?

00:27.444 --> 00:29.112
Yeah, l should have known.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.615
On Facebook she said
she wasn't very good at conversationing.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.158
She seems bangable,

00:34.243 --> 00:36.911
in a Megan's Law kind of a way.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.790
Hey, she's older than she looks,
and acts, and is.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.793
-Hey!
-Oh, crap. Hey.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.795
What are you guys doing here?

00:45.879 --> 00:49.507
We were out getting stuff to make jewelry
and decided to grab something to eat.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.925
Are you on a date?

00:51.009 --> 00:55.888
Absolutely not. Just stopped in
for a quick whiskey and Windex.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.642
Oh, good. Blue.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.603
Oh, you mean a date?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.064
This is Daytona.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.275
Daytona, this is my ex-wife, Jennifer
and my daughter, Sam.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.359
Hi.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.366
Okay, l know l said it's a date,
but it's not a date date.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.535
lt's more like two ships passing in the night

01:17.619 --> 01:20.747
and one ship is heading to LEGOLAND.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.499
lt's okay, Dad.
You don't have to make excuses.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.917
You can go out with whoever you want.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.085
No, l know, l know.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.296
l just want you to know
l don't normally date women like that.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.422
Yes, you do.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.468
What, what, what? How would you know?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.553
l look at your friends list on Facebook.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.430
You let her spy on me like that?

01:37.556 --> 01:40.433
l can't help it. She changed the password
and locked me out.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.477
l got to take a class or something.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.731
lt's okay, Dad. You like hotties.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.358
lt's kind of superficial, but l still love you.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.361
l am not superficial.
l date all kinds of women.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.655
So it's just a coincidence they're all hotties?

01:54.990 --> 01:56.741
lt is a fundamental law of human nature

01:56.825 --> 01:58.993
that good-looking people
are attracted to each other.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.828
l'm just a tool of evolution.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.373
This is how our species gets hotter.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.253
Okay, now that we're all here,
l thought everyone should know

02:09.338 --> 02:11.297
that we have a new member
joining us today.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.091
Her name is Mel
and she should fit nicely with this group.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.511
Finally, it'll be nice
to have a girl in the group.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.637
Hey!

02:18.305 --> 02:20.515
Patrick, why do you always
take shots at Lacey?

02:20.599 --> 02:22.350
You seem to have
a real resentment towards her.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.352
She's pretty, she's rich, she's spoiled.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.895
She's everything you want to be.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.688
Shut up, Ed.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.190
What Ed said.

02:30.526 --> 02:34.529
Remember, Patrick, there is nothing
more unattractive than envy.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.783
l think envy's here.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.702
You must be Mel. Welcome to the group.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.038
Sorry l'm late. l couldn't find the house.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.832
Then l found it.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.001
Oh, that's it?

02:50.087 --> 02:52.463
Okay. Everybody, this is Mel.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.842
Mel, this is Lacey, Nolan, Patrick and Ed.
Have a seat.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.556
Just so you know,
there's no pressure to talk today.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.890
You can just observe if you'd like.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.976
No, l'd like to jump right in.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.895
l like this fella. Doesn't mess around.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.274
Okay, Mel, you have the floor.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.401
Well, it all started with this guy.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.736
Of course it did. Jerks.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.323
Lacey, l think you're coloring this
with your experience.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.951
Her boyfriend cheated on her
and she shot him.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.495
Nolan, when Lacey is ready
to tell Mel her story, l'm sure...

03:24.580 --> 03:26.247
-ln the balls!
-And there it is.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.499
Go on, Mel.

03:28.584 --> 03:33.337
Well, l met this guy. He changed my life.
He gave me hope.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.215
And now l'm beginning to think
it was all based on a lie and l'm angry.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.508
-Been there.
-Done that.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.844
Me, too. Obama.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.973
l was so upset, l started to doubt myself.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.685
l lost about 1 00 pounds,
l had tons of cosmetic surgery.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.187
l see why you're angry.
You're mad at your plastic surgeon.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.775
l would sue that butcher
for everything he's got.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.485
Guys, guys, guys.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.822
Can we please refrain from comments
till Mel is done with her story?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.408
And, Mel, try to avoid pausing
between sentences.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.662
Anyway. l lived in this little town
outside Beloit, Wisconsin,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.498
and Beloit had
its own Single A baseball team.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.167
l know Beloit.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.294
When l was a ballplayer,
we used to play that team.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.254
There was this place, Nate's.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.423
Nate's Diner. They had killer apple pie.

04:17.549 --> 04:21.385
Oh, my God. That's so funny.
l met this guy at Nate's Diner.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.138
And he was a ballplayer, too,
from the visiting team.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.558
He told me l was the prettiest girl
in the Greater Beloit area,

04:27.643 --> 04:29.727
but after we made love,
l never heard from him again.

04:34.149 --> 04:39.487
You know, now that l think about it,
l don't think l ever played ball in Beloit.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.991
Also, l'm allergic to apples. So, that's weird.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.869
l was okay with him not calling.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.580
l still felt special that he picked me.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.416
But then last year l heard about
this superstition in baseball

04:52.501 --> 04:54.085
where if a player's in a hitting slump,

04:54.169 --> 04:57.171
he tries to break it by sleeping
with the ugliest girl he can find.

04:58.674 --> 05:03.386
And that naive, small-town, big-boned girl

05:03.470 --> 05:05.304
is called a slumpbuster.

05:07.099 --> 05:11.352
Slumpbuster? Wow.
This sounds like an urban legend to me.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.479
Like the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.274
Bad analogy.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.988
Mel, have you ever considered this guy
was just hot for full-figured ladies?

05:22.239 --> 05:25.825
Were you, Charlie?
Or was l your slumpbuster?

05:28.537 --> 05:29.829
Who didn't see that coming?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.666
Me, up until about 30 seconds ago.

05:38.672 --> 05:43.801
Okay, l do remember you.
But l was just a dumb ballplayer back then.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.679
You didn't have to be a slumpbuster
for me not to call you the next day.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.349
You just had to be any woman
l had sex with.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.352
l told you, l don't care that you didn't call.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.354
That night changed my life.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.983
ln my town, l was known as the girl
who slept with Charlie Goodson.

05:59.151 --> 06:02.111
And l always thought of myself
as the guy who slept with Mel,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.406
from that town.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.825
lt meant everything.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.662
Out of all the girls in the pie-eating contest
that night, you picked me.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.248
l hooked up with a hot baseball player.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.585
Then my cousin heard about
slumpbusters on a sports talk show.

06:17.669 --> 06:21.172
l became the joke of the town.
l couldn't even look at myself in the mirror.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.340
Yeah, l understand.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.217
l mean, l understand.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.137
l spent everything l had on plastic surgery

06:28.221 --> 06:30.723
and it still didn't make me
feel better about myself.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.351
But if you tell me l'm not your slumpbuster,
l'll believe you.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.479
And l can go back home and tell everybody,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.898
"Screw you, l know better."

06:39.900 --> 06:41.067
Mel.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.318
Yes?

06:42.444 --> 06:43.819
You were not my slumpbuster.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.321
l don't believe you.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.825
l would never have done something like that
just to get my batting average up.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.827
Really? Because when we were making love,

06:51.912 --> 06:54.955
l heard you say,
"l better make the Hall of Fame for this."

06:55.540 --> 06:58.667
Yes. The Hall of Fame of Sex.

07:00.128 --> 07:04.381
l meant with all the positions and the stuff.
lt was one for the ages.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.092
You just laid there.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.718
l was in awe!

07:08.887 --> 07:10.679
Look, look, Mel.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.725
l didn't sleep with you
because you were unattractive.

07:14.810 --> 07:18.813
l slept with you because
you were drunk and easy,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.147
and you smelled like pie.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.235
You're just trying
to sweet-talk your way out of this.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.029
lf l were, l wouldn't be offering
to have dinner with you.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.989
-Really?
-Yes.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.116
Then, when you go home,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.660
you can be the girl
who had dinner with Charlie Goodson.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.953
Where will you take me?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.664
l could take you anywhere.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.916
But l want this to be special.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.043
l'm gonna make dinner
for you as a guest in my home.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.419
You'd really do that?

07:42.838 --> 07:46.298
l'd love to. l'm a great cook.
ls there anything you can't eat?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.884
No, l'm fine with pretty much everything.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.344
Well, all l can make is spaghetti.

07:50.637 --> 07:55.015
Oh, okay. l'll bring my EpiPen.
You may have to jam it in my thigh.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.186
Until tonight.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.319
lt's funny watching you try to cook.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.698
Look, if you're just gonna stand there
drinking beer and criticizing me,

08:10.782 --> 08:12.366
could you at least take off your top?

08:13.451 --> 08:17.872
l've seen you handle cutlery.
lf l take out the girls, you'll chop off a finger.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.835
Just do me a favor and set the table.
Toss me that box of spaghetti.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.714
Besides being a culinary show-off,
why are you doing this?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.841
Because l feel bad. l want to make amends

08:28.925 --> 08:30.885
for making her think
that she was my slumpbuster.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.096
-But she was, right?
-Well, yeah.

08:34.973 --> 08:38.601
But l could never tell her that. lt would only
confirm her worst feelings about herself.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.477
So, what's the plan here?

08:40.562 --> 08:42.313
Well, l'm gonna cook her a nice
dinner, and that way,

08:42.397 --> 08:44.648
when she goes home tomorrow,
she'll know that l didn't use her.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.692
But you did.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.027
Of course.

08:48.737 --> 08:53.199
She's the reason l got to the Majors.
And had that bout of night terrors.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.036
You know what?
l don't even know how to make spaghetti.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.871
Just read the instructions.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.873
There are no instructions on spaghetti.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.586
lt's like doorknobs.
You're just supposed to know what to do.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.922
l think you're crazy, okay?

09:08.006 --> 09:11.217
This woman has had a fantasy relationship
with you for the past 1 6 years.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.136
Now, she's tracked you down,
exposed you in front of your patients.

09:14.221 --> 09:19.266
And you're so busy trying to be a better guy,
that you are cooking dinner for a stalker.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.310
She's not a stalker.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.188
She's just a woman
with pathologically low self-esteem,

09:24.272 --> 09:27.191
obsessive fixations, and
a tendency toward grandiose delusions.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.236
Let's put the knives away.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.448
Maybe you should call it off.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.659
And piss off my stalker? No.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.038
Just gonna get through this dinner
as quickly as possible.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.124
Oh, look, l found the directions.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.043
Put pasta in boiling water.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.420
For best results,
prepare while staring at boobs.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.050
l'm gonna need you to stand right there.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.267
So after the lipo, the next surgery l had
was the Lap-Band.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.477
And the first meal after that was a real mess.

10:04.688 --> 10:08.399
They tell you just to have Jell-O,
but l had catfish jambalaya.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.111
l never knew how far vomit could go.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.654
lf l hadn't been in a crowded elevator,

10:13.738 --> 10:16.073
l think l would have broken
some kind of record.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.578
Wow, that's like three awesome
surgery stories in a row.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.665
Listen, if you're watching your weight,
l can help you with that spaghetti.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.959
Oh, no. l'm just making it last.

10:27.043 --> 10:32.381
l've fantasized about this date for so long,
the food, the candlelight, the conversation.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.302
Did l tell you they took off my nipples?

10:38.013 --> 10:40.973
No. They put them back on, right?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.268
Are you flirting with me, Mr. Goodson?

10:45.562 --> 10:47.229
No, l just want to make sure
you got what you paid for.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.233
Let me help you with that spaghetti.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.324
Lady and the Tramp. Lady and the Tramp.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.670
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you guys doing here?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.339
Sam left her backpack.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.673
What, are you on a date?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.342
l don't think it's a date, Mom.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.136
She looks like a regular person.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.805
Wait. What's that supposed to mean?
l go out with regular people, too.

11:21.890 --> 11:22.890
So this is a date?

11:23.058 --> 11:24.933
-Yes.
-A date date?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.935
Yes, yes.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.855
Wow. Dad, l'm so proud of you.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.982
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.150
Can we meet her?

11:33.234 --> 11:36.487
Well, you know, it's our first time together.
You understand, right, Jen?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.113
No, l'd like to meet her. Come on, Sam.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.492
Guys, this is Mel.

11:41.576 --> 11:45.162
Mel, this is my ex-wife, Jen
and my daughter, Sam.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.748
Just so you know, Mel,
you're dating a great guy.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.751
Dating? Did your dad tell you that?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.336
Yeah. Right, Dad?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.587
Yeah, l did.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.090
Wow. l'm just so excited.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.677
l know. Me, too. Let's never lose this.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.182
Hey, Mom, can l invite them to come over
and make jewelry with us tomorrow night?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.352
-No, no, no, we wouldn't want to impose...
-Oh, no, l insist.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.937
...on your special night. Of course you do.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.899
l can't wait to learn all about what this is.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.445
l love making jewelry.
l made tiaras for all my cats.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.407
This is gonna be so much fun.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.618
l'm so excited, l'm gonna bust.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.621
l just got to go use the little girl's room.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.706
You know, to fix my face.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.586
Nobody?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.632
Good for you.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.638
Look, before we begin, l want to talk
about what happened yesterday.

12:45.682 --> 12:49.518
You all witnessed
what we in therapy call a train wreck.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.730
l don't want this to distract us,
so we're just gonna keep moving forward.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.275
l have something important about
my life l'd like to discuss.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.152
Thank you. Lacey.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.363
How am l supposed to work
through my issues with men being dicks

13:01.448 --> 13:04.741
while women are showing up in this group
as a result of your past dickness?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.913
Look, like all of you, l've made mistakes.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.708
And unfortunately yesterday
one of those mistakes reared its ugly head.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.294
Now when l say "ugly head,"
l'm using the term as a metaphor

13:15.378 --> 13:17.337
and not a description for that young lady.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.381
And her ugly head.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.675
So how did you deal with it?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.470
l talked to her and we're working
on building her self-esteem.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.556
Really? 'Cause it says on Facebook
that you're dating her.

13:28.391 --> 13:31.935
lt's radical self-esteem therapy.
You guys wouldn't understand.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.397
You're dating your stalker? See?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.983
Other people make it work.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.611
How could she be my stalker
if l'm dating her?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.779
l mean, come on. Think about it.
lt doesn't make sense, does it?

13:42.864 --> 13:45.574
No, of course not. Moving on.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.244
Her status update says
she's making jewelry with you tonight

13:49.329 --> 13:53.040
and she's hoping for a ring.
Smile, winky face.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.375
Oh, God.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.836
All right, all right, look, look.

13:57.921 --> 14:01.173
The lesson here,
and there are many lessons.

14:02.383 --> 14:06.678
But the headline lesson is,
whatever you do, never use a slumpbuster.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.765
l realize this doesn't apply to everybody,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.977
but for the love of God,

14:14.062 --> 14:15.437
just don't.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.983
So, Mel, you never told us
how you met my dad.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.152
Oh, this is my favorite story.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.446
Oh, let me tell. You always get to tell.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.656
Okay.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.784
lt's really magical. lt's like out of a movie.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.080
We met at a diner and she was eating a pie.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.749
Would you pass the red beads, please?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.835
Don't be shy.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.671
lt was 1 6 years ago.

14:40.755 --> 14:44.258
l was in a pie-eating contest
and your daddy was the prize.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.426
Wait, 1 6 years ago?
That doesn't make sense.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.761
My parents were still married.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.221
Yes, we were.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.557
Which is why Mel
and l could only be friends.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.769
But we had a connection
that lasted all these years.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.857
And now the universe
has brought her back to me.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.528
As ours is a relationship

15:04.612 --> 15:08.448
that knows no constraints of time nor space.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.535
That was the beads.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.204
They're ready to come out of the oven.
Mel, can you help me?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.457
You know, Charlie,
the whole time you've been here,

15:17.542 --> 15:21.461
l haven't seen you hold Mel's hand
or give her a kiss or anything.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.464
Well, you know how new couples are.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.425
We don't want to gross you out.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.760
She's going to the kitchen.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.763
Can you handle that much time and space?

15:32.640 --> 15:33.807
l know l can't.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.108
You taste like home.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.361
And you taste like spaghetti.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.448
lt's the garlic. l sweat it.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.825
And you are making me sweat.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.621
Hey, you guys, stay right where you are.

15:55.705 --> 16:01.001
l want to get a picture of the two of you
so l can post it on everything.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.508
You better get into the kitchen.
l think somebody's beads are burning.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.093
They are now.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.933
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

16:17.018 --> 16:18.101
Look, l'm in trouble, okay?

16:18.186 --> 16:20.687
Mel was a slumpbuster from Beloit
and now she thinks we're dating.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.232
l mean, it's a long story.
Actually, that's the entire story.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.318
l knew it. You're using that woman

16:26.402 --> 16:28.612
to make your daughter think
you're not superficial.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.698
l know. l just need you
to help me through the next hour.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.159
Get her back to the hotel,
put her on a flight tomorrow,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.744
and this whole thing will be over.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.998
She's happy, Sam's happy,
and you and l will have a fun little secret.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.709
-Like on our honeymoon when you let me...
-That never happened.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.300
l'm so sorry, Charlie. l feel so bad.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.387
My tongue swells
when l have an allergic reaction.

16:53.554 --> 16:57.015
l completely forgot
Peanut M&Ms have peanuts.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.351
Shouldn't we get you
to an ER or something?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.478
No, no. l just left my EpiPen in the kitchen.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.899
Okay, but hurry.
We've got to get you back to the hotel.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.320
Hey, it looks like Jen already got
that photo uploaded.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.364
Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Flickr,

17:13.408 --> 17:17.077
and the website of
the American Psychological Association.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.789
Hey, Charlie. l found it.
Can you come stick it in me?

17:28.673 --> 17:30.340
Hey, Charlie.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.095
Wait a minute, you weren't having
an allergic reaction. You were...

17:38.891 --> 17:40.767
They do good work in Wisconsin.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.315
l'm a sexy ghost.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.902
That's not why l'm doing this.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.946
This can't happen.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.614
Of course it can.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.701
Or do you need to take a pill or something?

17:57.827 --> 18:00.912
No. No, l'm very sorry.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.332
l just thought we had a great night once

18:04.417 --> 18:07.878
and that this could be the start
of something bigger and more beautiful.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.296
Well...

18:09.756 --> 18:13.133
You just made the next thing
l'm about to say very difficult.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.970
We're not really dating, are we?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.139
No.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.517
l was your slumpbuster, wasn't l?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.606
Yes.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.819
And l am very, very sorry.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.905
Why didn't you just tell me?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.240
l didn't want you to think
that way about yourself,

18:37.325 --> 18:38.784
because that's not how l think of you.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.620
To me, you'll always be
that pie-eating champion

18:41.704 --> 18:44.831
who could raise a naked man
clean over her head.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.459
l don't believe this.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.004
l spent all this time and money
making my body look like this

18:51.088 --> 18:53.173
and you still don't want to make love to me.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.676
That would have been wrong.
That's the old me.

18:59.514 --> 19:02.557
Now what am l gonna do? Look at me.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.018
l'm too hot to even be a slumpbuster.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.728
No, you're not.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.397
Okay, l can't win that one.

19:11.192 --> 19:15.779
Look, you are still the same confident,
amazing person you were

19:15.863 --> 19:18.281
when you thought you were
just a hot one-night stand.

19:19.951 --> 19:23.078
-Bet l could still lift you over my head.
-Yes.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.122
Yes, that's the confidence that's in you,
no matter what l did.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.917
That's not just some nipple
you can take off and put back on.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.377
That's forever.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.678
Hey. You ready?

19:39.929 --> 19:42.180
Oh, softball time, right.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.933
Yes, l am ready to go.
Sam, you wearing your cup?

19:45.810 --> 19:49.563
Are we gonna do this every single time?
You can just say you wanted a boy.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.356
Actually, l wanted a dog.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.484
But the landlord wanted a $1 00 deposit,
so here you are.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.487
Could you give Sam and l a minute?

19:57.572 --> 19:59.114
l want to clear up a few things about Mel.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.408
Oh, it's okay, Dad. Mom already told me.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.826
-She did?
-Yeah.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.996
How you wanted a deeper,
more meaningful relationship

20:06.080 --> 20:08.582
and Mel just wanted to sleep with you.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.087
How many times
is this gonna happen to me?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.133
lt's okay, Dad.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.426
Now, come on, we're gonna be late.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.761
That's my boy.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.977
-That was amazing.
-You're welcome.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.855
You know, you make a much better ex-wife
than you ever did a wife.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.025
-l figured you got the message.
-l did.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.027
-Hey, could you do me another favor?
-What?

20:37.320 --> 20:39.029
l need you to take Sam for the weekend.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.322
Why? Where are you going?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.489
Beloit.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.366
l'm gonna walk up and down
every street holding hands

20:43.451 --> 20:44.910
with Mel for all of her friends to see.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.246
After everything you did,
that's all she wants from you?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.832
Small town, small victories.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.211
By the way, you can also thank me
for being so cool.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.049
That's the first woman l met that
you slept with while you were on the road.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.468
Hey, l slept with her for us.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.929
That was to break my slump,
so we could make the big leagues.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.555
Really?

21:05.640 --> 21:08.141
What about that girl Diane from San Diego?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.645
Oh, that was for me.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.980
And a little bit for Diane.
