-and then someone shot her.
-What?

08:25.822 --> 08:27.989
This woman died while you were
on the phone with her?

08:28.050 --> 08:30.583
Yeah. I mean, Josh
was on the call, too,

08:30.719 --> 08:32.677
and he said I did
everything right, but...

08:32.870 --> 08:34.254
all I keep thinking is,

08:34.389 --> 08:36.431
"What if
I'd sent police sooner?"

08:37.184 --> 08:38.742
Dad, don't--

08:38.802 --> 08:40.243
Hey, you know,
am I allowed to be

08:40.262 --> 08:41.761
a little bit concerned

08:41.913 --> 08:43.688
that my daughter just heard
her first homicide?

08:43.857 --> 08:44.914
No.

08:45.016 --> 08:46.750
-No?
-No!

08:46.768 --> 08:49.027
Look, I can't have you
and Mom mad at me about this.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.695
You promised me
you'd be supportive,

08:50.888 --> 08:52.322
so...Dad up.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.925
Okay. Okay.

08:55.986 --> 08:58.119
Dadding up.

09:01.157 --> 09:04.434
<i> (soft music)</i>

09:04.494 --> 09:07.604
Josh was on the call
with you, right?

09:07.664 --> 09:08.788
Okay, so he could have
jumped in

09:08.882 --> 09:09.914
if you missed something.

09:10.108 --> 09:11.716
Yes,
and Josh said that too.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.885
I just don't know
how to shake off the feeling

09:14.054 --> 09:17.722
that there was something else
that I could've done, you know?

09:17.915 --> 09:20.283
Oh, baby, your life
is just moving

09:20.343 --> 09:22.060
beyond my level of experience.

09:22.253 --> 09:23.953
I mean, you were never
a first responder,

09:24.014 --> 09:25.730
but you were married to one.

09:25.923 --> 09:28.625
Mom must have talked to you
about this stuff.

09:28.685 --> 09:30.126
Not really.

09:30.186 --> 09:32.219
She never brought
that kinda stuff home.

09:32.281 --> 09:36.241
She always said
she left her job behind

09:36.434 --> 09:39.244
when she took off the uniform
at the end of the day.

09:39.395 --> 09:41.228
All I have is a polo.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.664
(chuckles)

09:44.108 --> 09:45.917
Listen.

09:46.110 --> 09:47.902
Baby, I don't know
what to tell you

09:47.963 --> 09:50.997
except maybe ask your mother.

09:51.133 --> 09:54.317
<i> ♪ </i>

09:54.377 --> 09:57.987
(sirens wailing)

09:58.089 --> 09:59.747
You get the files
I sent you?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.582
Took me a while
to get through 'em all.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.585
How many lawsuits can one woman
file against her neighbors--

10:04.605 --> 10:06.253
complaints
to the building department,

10:06.315 --> 10:07.697
zoning board,
and for some reason,

10:07.699 --> 10:09.515
the Department
of Waste Management?

10:09.651 --> 10:12.185
Come on, Athena, everybody
knows you're supposed to

10:12.337 --> 10:14.261
bring your trash cans in
before 8:00 p.m.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.023
Yeah. I see she also filed
some police reports too.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.192
Yeah. Delia Narwood
was waging war

10:19.286 --> 10:21.511
against the entire cul-de-sac.

10:21.571 --> 10:25.014
Let's go find out
who decided to return fire.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.274
SANDI: She said we were running
an unlicensed business

10:27.336 --> 10:28.701
out of our home.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.203
All sidewalk vendors

10:30.297 --> 10:33.798
require business, tax,
and health permits.

10:33.991 --> 10:35.541
Do ya have those permits?

10:35.636 --> 10:37.377
<i> SANDI: She traumatized</i>
<i> my daughter...</i>

10:37.471 --> 10:38.953
over a lemonade stand?

10:39.056 --> 10:40.621
What kind of person does that?

10:40.641 --> 10:42.641
I think she was just
deeply unhappy.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.868
You know the type--
they're miserable,

10:44.886 --> 10:46.645
and they want everyone else
to be miserable too.

10:46.838 --> 10:48.796
We won her over in the end,
though...

10:48.815 --> 10:49.814
with baked goods.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.483
Zucchini bread.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.968
Baking has become
Rita's new obsession.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.546
Every time I turn around,
she's covered in flour.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.306
Well, we're just home so much
more than I thought we'd be,

10:59.368 --> 11:00.492
I figured I needed a hobby.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.568
The sourdough--
super challenging.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.053
Because the starter,
it's really hard

11:04.155 --> 11:05.738
-to feed and keep alive--
-So..

11:05.891 --> 11:07.999
-the day of the block party.
-Yes.

11:08.192 --> 11:09.742
Such a lovely gathering.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.411
I mean, up until the...

11:11.505 --> 11:12.837
-murder.
-MELVIN: That was Delia.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.397
Never missed an opportunity

11:14.457 --> 11:16.916
to ruin things
for everyone else.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.761
It's no wonder so many people
wished her ill.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.256
Yeah, she totally
had it comin'.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.591
JOHN: Joe, they're here
investigating a murder.

11:25.744 --> 11:27.018
-Maybe you shouldn't--
-Well, they know

11:27.211 --> 11:28.353
we didn't kill her.

11:28.546 --> 11:30.522
You do know that, right?

11:30.715 --> 11:33.249
We saw the police report
you filed.

11:33.351 --> 11:35.509
We know what she did.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.086
Archie!

11:37.147 --> 11:40.089
Please tell me you
didn't get into her yard again.

11:40.150 --> 11:43.092
-(whining)
-Oh, my God, Archie!

11:43.153 --> 11:44.277
Oh, my God!

11:44.371 --> 11:45.929
JOHN: What's wrong?

11:45.989 --> 11:46.946
Archie!

11:47.040 --> 11:50.116
<i> (suspenseful music)</i>

11:50.268 --> 11:51.692
<i> JOHN: She poisoned him.</i>

11:51.712 --> 11:54.270
If we hadn't got him
to the vet when we did...

11:54.289 --> 11:55.547
Who does that to a dog?

11:55.698 --> 11:57.273
And you had words with her
afterwards?

11:57.333 --> 11:59.141
I said I hoped
she'd burn in Hell.

11:59.143 --> 12:01.428
And look...
wishes come true.

12:02.781 --> 12:04.055
So we've got someone
who steals mail,

12:04.207 --> 12:05.706
terrorizes small children,

12:05.767 --> 12:08.284
and poisons adorable dogs,
and that's our victim.

12:08.386 --> 12:12.713
Meanwhile, all of our suspects
have alibis--

12:12.733 --> 12:14.065
each other.

12:14.258 --> 12:15.883
RICK:
<i> Murder on the Orient Express.</i>

12:15.986 --> 12:17.485
Maybe they all did it.

12:19.388 --> 12:21.130
I got wine--red, white,

12:21.191 --> 12:23.908
sparkling, in case you wanna do
any celebratory toasts,

12:24.101 --> 12:25.910
and tequila.

12:26.103 --> 12:27.561
Not sure why we needed
two bottles.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.581
Those are for me.

12:29.774 --> 12:31.398
You're wearing jeans.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.251
Well, I was told I was
not allowed to wear jeans.

12:33.444 --> 12:35.569
You stop whining.
Pre-heat the oven.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.755
-350.
-MADDIE: Whoa!

12:36.906 --> 12:38.405
-We're baking stuff?
-Baked brie.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.984
-Fig jam.
-When did you start liking fig?

12:41.044 --> 12:42.260
(knock on door)

12:43.171 --> 12:44.637
Hey.

12:47.050 --> 12:48.683
And I think we're ready.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.352
(exhales)

12:53.023 --> 12:54.588
-Dad!
-Maddie.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.517
Mom! You guys did not
have to bring presents.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.336
We're grandparents now.
Spoiling comes with the job.

13:00.355 --> 13:02.021
Mr. and Mrs. Buckley,
hi, I'm Howard Han.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.506
It's nice to finally
meet you both.

13:03.608 --> 13:04.507
-Hi, Howard.
-CHIMNEY: Please

13:04.526 --> 13:05.858
let me get these for you.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.844
-MARGARET: Thank you.
-PHILLIP: Thanks.

13:07.904 --> 13:09.603
-Hey.
-MARGARET: Evan.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.181
-You look good.
-Ah, so do you.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.125
Uh, this is my brother
Albert.

13:14.318 --> 13:15.460
And Buck's roommate.

13:15.653 --> 13:17.370
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.522
Buck. You're still letting
people call you that.

13:19.582 --> 13:21.207
-It's just a nickname, Mom.
-MARGARET: Ugh.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.617
Oh, you guys don't like
nicknames?

13:23.678 --> 13:25.303
But Maddie--

13:25.496 --> 13:27.955
Is the name
on my birth certificate.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.216
Would anyone like a drink?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.143
We have many options.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.386
I believe
I'll start with tequila.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.388
PHILLIP: So Howard, do...

13:35.524 --> 13:37.357
people call you Howard?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.634
Yes. Yes, they do.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.986
Please, this way.

13:42.179 --> 13:43.229
Mrs. Buckley.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.657
MADDIE: We got this.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.325
BUCK: United front.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.243
I'm glad you guys
had a nice drive.

13:57.395 --> 13:58.837
We saw a lot of the country.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.746
MARGARET: The first few days,
there was nothing but rain,

14:00.899 --> 14:04.450
then we got here,
blue skies and sunshine.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.919
Yeah, we had a lotta rain
earlier in the year,

14:07.013 --> 14:08.905
but, uh, lately,
it's been dry.

14:08.965 --> 14:10.849
Hmm.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.852
I-I can't believe you drove
all the way across the country

14:14.045 --> 14:15.244
in an RV--that sounds exciting.

14:15.263 --> 14:16.637
PHILLIP:
Statistically speaking,

14:16.690 --> 14:19.415
it seemed the safest way
to travel right now.

14:19.475 --> 14:21.417
Yeah. We didn't wanna
take any chances,

14:21.436 --> 14:23.252
given Maddie's condition

14:23.354 --> 14:25.755
and it being
a high-risk pregnancy.

14:25.773 --> 14:28.533
Well, no, it's not really
high-risk--

14:28.726 --> 14:30.034
Oh, she's over 35.

14:30.227 --> 14:31.944
That puts her
at a higher risk,

14:32.038 --> 14:34.706
so we all need to be
extra careful.

14:34.899 --> 14:36.708
-The baby's fine, Mom.
-MARGARET: But you don't wanna

14:36.901 --> 14:38.284
take any chances.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.503
Not when you've waited
this long.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.364
-(mouths) Wow.
-Uh, she was just waiting

14:43.425 --> 14:44.941
for the right time.

14:45.001 --> 14:47.218
The right guy.

14:47.411 --> 14:49.053
-God knows it wasn't Doug.
-Okay.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.780
Let's not talk about him.

14:50.798 --> 14:53.966
Of course, I'm sorry.
(chuckles) I'm just...

14:54.119 --> 14:56.210
I'm so happy

14:56.271 --> 14:58.137
to see you happy.

14:58.289 --> 15:00.381
Now, Evan, Maddie tells us

15:00.483 --> 15:01.791
that you've been seeing
a therapist?

15:01.809 --> 15:02.883
She did?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.627
I'm gonna get
some water.

15:04.687 --> 15:06.553
Anything we should be
worried about there?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.722
No. Ha ha, no.
Of course not.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.075
It's--that's the job, you know?
It can be stressful.

15:11.268 --> 15:13.227
It's--it's good to try
and get ahead of it.

15:13.288 --> 15:17.123
You know, your father and I
went to see a therapist.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.734
Uh, really? When?

15:20.795 --> 15:23.312
Well, after all this business
with Maddie

15:23.331 --> 15:25.648
and the husband
who shall not be named,

15:25.708 --> 15:28.000
we felt like
there were some things

15:28.094 --> 15:29.576
we needed to work through.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.821
So you...you went
and talked to a therapist

15:31.881 --> 15:33.005
about my problems?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.248
PHILLIP: It wasn't
as if you wanted to

15:34.309 --> 15:35.600
talk to us about them.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.751
Buck had to call
to tell us that Doug was dead.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.662
Well, I didn't want you
to find out on<i> Dateline.</i>

15:39.681 --> 15:40.939
CHIMNEY: You know what,
I'm gonna start

15:41.090 --> 15:42.923
bringing this stuff
into the kitchen.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.592
Would anybody like a refill
while I'm in there?

15:45.654 --> 15:47.853
I'll help.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.021
Yeah, uh...

15:49.157 --> 15:51.282
me--me too.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.678
Evan seems good.

15:55.697 --> 15:58.439
After you called,
I was expecting...

15:58.500 --> 16:00.866
(exhales)
I don't know what.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.518
But he seems fine.

16:02.578 --> 16:05.705
Yeah, I think he's better
at that than we think.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.215
Seeming fine.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.361
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.121
Got a call about
our crime scene this morning.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.698
A uni was driving by
and noticed

16:15.717 --> 16:17.624
someone had broken the seal
on the front door.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.978
Someone broke into
Delia's house?

16:20.129 --> 16:21.646
Mm-hmm.
Ransacked the place.

16:21.839 --> 16:24.874
Well, why do you look
so happy about it?

16:24.892 --> 16:27.151
'Cause when I went over
to see what was missing...

16:27.344 --> 16:29.654
I found...this.

16:29.847 --> 16:30.804
(phone chimes)

16:30.865 --> 16:33.324
<i> (suspenseful music)</i>

16:33.517 --> 16:36.310
Hmm.
Some kinda white powder?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.162
Uh-huh.
Smelled like flour.

16:38.355 --> 16:40.906
With a hint of sourdough.

16:41.059 --> 16:43.501
Baking has become
Rita's new obsession.

16:43.694 --> 16:46.254
(sighs)
Zucchini bread.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.582
RICK: Whatever Rita the baker
was looking for

16:49.718 --> 16:51.083
has gotta be
in one of these boxes.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.826
The techs took everything
outta that house

16:52.846 --> 16:55.755
-that wasn't nailed down.
-Hmm. Crowder.

16:55.890 --> 16:59.017
-What?
-I have an open envelope here

16:59.210 --> 17:01.093
addressed to
Jeanine R. Crowder.

17:01.246 --> 17:03.337
I don't remember talking
to anyone with that last name.

-Nope.

Jeanine Crowder.

Wanted for larceny,
fraud, identity theft,

17:22.751 --> 17:24.600
Rita is not Rita.

17:24.660 --> 17:27.103
And Delia
didn't just know that.

17:27.163 --> 17:29.047
She had the evidence
to prove it.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.883
Evidence that Rita
didn't want us to find.

My wife is not a murderer!

17:40.602 --> 17:42.301
Sorry to have to be
the bearer of bad news,

17:42.453 --> 17:44.228
but she is also not your wife.

17:44.421 --> 17:46.956
RICK: She's under arrest
for bigamy.

17:46.974 --> 17:48.715
-You know about Marshall?
-ATHENA: We thought

17:48.818 --> 17:50.793
your other husband's name
was Jerome.

17:50.812 --> 17:52.386
Oh. Damn it, now you know
about him too.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.387
-Rita!
-Honey.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.980
I can explain everything.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.649
-Found the gun in the kitchen.
-RITA: Okay.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.160
That one might be
a little harder to explain.

18:02.398 --> 18:04.415
-BOBBY: Hey.
-Hey.

18:04.608 --> 18:06.233
Didn't expect you home
so early.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.644
Thought you were
at some pool party.

18:08.704 --> 18:10.996
Yeah.
Didn't feel like staying.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.149
Is Mom home?

18:13.209 --> 18:15.409
No, she's at work tonight.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.002
Is everything okay?

18:17.097 --> 18:19.822
I took that call
the other day.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.491
The lady who got shot
and fell into her pool?

18:22.552 --> 18:24.510
Mm, yeah, pool party maybe
not the thing

18:24.604 --> 18:26.086
to take your mind
off your job.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.848
I get that I need to learn
how to let go,

18:28.942 --> 18:31.925
you know, take off the uniform
and leave the job behind.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.853
Well, that is certainly
how your mother does it.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.522
I-I've never been able
to compartmentalize that much.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.190
Okay, well,
how do you do it?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.933
I mean, you've been
a first responder

18:39.994 --> 18:41.768
a really, really long time,
so...

18:41.830 --> 18:43.512
I mean, not that you're...

18:43.531 --> 18:45.456
(laughing)
Yes, it's true.

18:45.649 --> 18:48.609
I have been doing this job
longer than you've been alive.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.078
But no, I didn't always know
how to deal with the stresses

18:51.131 --> 18:52.946
that come with it.
For a long time,

18:53.007 --> 18:55.949
my coping mechanism was a mix
of vodka and Percocet.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.951
Which I do not recommend.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.303
Copy that.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.475
May, it's natural...

19:04.627 --> 19:06.369
to go over the losses
in your head,

19:06.387 --> 19:09.555
to think about all the things
you could have done differently

19:09.649 --> 19:12.483
knowing now
what you didn't know then.

19:12.635 --> 19:15.153
I keep trying to figure out
what I could have done better,

19:15.346 --> 19:16.988
how I could have saved her.

19:17.181 --> 19:18.823
You couldn't.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.142
You're gonna lose people,

19:22.203 --> 19:24.144
and it is never
gonna feel okay.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.979
But that doesn't mean
it's your fault.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.331
It just means
that you care.

19:27.524 --> 19:30.817
And there is nothing wrong
with that.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.459
The sister too?

26:10.519 --> 26:11.718
(sighs)

26:11.779 --> 26:13.053
Wow.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.722
And then she goes
and tells me.

26:15.783 --> 26:16.965
What'd you even say?

26:17.026 --> 26:18.634
What was I supposed to say,
huh?

26:18.652 --> 26:20.244
Hey, is that a dead man's
trigger or--?

26:20.437 --> 26:22.805
I just figured
he wanted me outta there.

26:22.823 --> 26:24.823
A plunger means he controls it.
A dead man's trigger

26:24.917 --> 26:26.733
-is designed so that--
-I'm familiar, Buck.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.752
JIM: Okay. My guys got
a partial visual with infrared.

26:28.945 --> 26:30.979
He said they're just...
sitting there.

26:30.998 --> 26:32.815
-Might be talking.
-EDDIE: Talking him down.

26:32.916 --> 26:34.425
BOBBY: Could be just
buying us some time.

26:34.576 --> 26:35.909
EVAN: What do you think
they're talking about?

26:35.928 --> 26:38.762
He never asked about it?
Never suspected a thing?

26:38.914 --> 26:40.839
No. He was just a little kid.
I mean,

26:40.933 --> 26:43.492
there's a big age gap between
him and his sister, so...

26:43.552 --> 26:46.920
Ha. You sure you wanna
be part of this family?

26:47.023 --> 26:50.015
(laughs)
Well...

26:50.151 --> 26:52.334
Maddie's pretty great.

26:52.394 --> 26:54.336
I'm really looking forward
to being a dad.

26:54.396 --> 26:56.855
If I can just make it
through this visit.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.174
Hell, if I can just make it
through dinner with them.

26:59.193 --> 27:00.784
Wait, wait, wait.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.028
Another family gathering?

27:03.180 --> 27:05.180
Whew. Wow.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.606
That is...

27:06.667 --> 27:09.609
Very explosive.
Yes, very.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.295
Copy that.

27:11.446 --> 27:13.021
Company searched
their job site.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.373
Discovered 6 pounds
of C4 missing.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.116
Well, he knew exactly
where to find it.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.951
Maybe Chimney needs to
stop talking to him.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.045
Could set him off.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.090
Sorry.
Uh, bad choice of words.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.717
You gotta tell him.
He deserves to know.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.460
I feel terrible about it.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.555
And I have been dying
to tell somebody!

27:30.650 --> 27:32.298
(coughing)

27:32.318 --> 27:34.300
(wheezing)
I'm happy--(coughs)

27:34.362 --> 27:36.153
I can help you
get it off your chest.

27:36.304 --> 27:37.896
-(wheezing)
-Thanks, Stan.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.048
Hey, listen, it sounds like

27:40.067 --> 27:41.784
your chest
ain't doing so well.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.570
Just one hit.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.055
(wheezing)

27:47.157 --> 27:49.667
It's not a trick.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.169
It'll help you.

27:53.196 --> 27:54.797
Just albuterol.

28:01.538 --> 28:04.848
(sighs)
We all got problems, Stan.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.434
Yours don't give you the right
to blow up innocent people.

28:08.879 --> 28:10.187
Or me.

28:12.917 --> 28:15.317
All clear, all clear.
We're comin' out.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.937
Thanks for listening to me,
Stan.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.156
(moans)

28:23.536 --> 28:26.036
STAN: Is that--
Hey, are you Buck?

28:26.229 --> 28:27.279
CHIMNEY: Please sit back.
That's it.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.373
Uh, yeah, that's me.

28:29.524 --> 28:31.024
-STAN: Ha ha. So it's true.
-HEN: What's true?

28:31.043 --> 28:33.602
CHIMNEY: Okay, that O2
must really be kickin' in.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.212
-In ya go, Stanley!
-STAN: You're not lyin'.

28:35.439 --> 28:36.455
-BUCK: Not lying about what?
-CHIMNEY: Nothin'--gotta go!

28:36.549 --> 28:39.133
STAN: Nice to meet you, Buck.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.764
-(bell rings)
-(indistinct chatter)

28:47.250 --> 28:50.519
(indistinct P.A.)

28:53.715 --> 28:55.457
It's about Buck.

28:55.517 --> 28:57.276
What?

28:57.427 --> 28:59.052
The thing you know.
The thing that's been

28:59.155 --> 29:00.796
killing you
for the last few days.

29:00.856 --> 29:02.406
It's about Buck.

29:02.599 --> 29:04.366
(wheezy laugh)

29:05.911 --> 29:07.894
(whispering) I'm sorry.
I would love nothing more than

29:07.955 --> 29:10.897
to unburden myself to you right
now, but I made a promise.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.491
Are you mad?

29:12.643 --> 29:14.067
I'm impressed.

29:14.161 --> 29:18.238
You're growing as a human
right before my eyes.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.649
(both laughing)

29:20.751 --> 29:22.317
Think it's ever okay
to keep a secret

29:22.336 --> 29:23.652
from someone you care about?

29:23.754 --> 29:25.337
It depends on what
the secret is

29:25.431 --> 29:27.080
and why you're keeping it.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.915
CHIMNEY: They all think
they're protecting him.

29:28.976 --> 29:32.494
Like lying to him means
the truth can't hurt him.

29:32.554 --> 29:35.314
But you think
they're wrong?

29:37.226 --> 29:39.259
I think there's a reason
why he feels alone.

29:39.278 --> 29:43.429
He is. He's the only one
not in on it.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.024
Also, I'm not in on it.
For the record.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.193
Whatever "it" is...

29:48.287 --> 29:50.370
you keep that to yourself.

30:00.490 --> 30:02.615
<i> RITA: Yes, I was married</i>
<i> to three men at once,</i>

30:02.635 --> 30:04.876
and yes, I ransacked
Delia's house.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.428
But I didn't kill her.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.700
<i> RICK: You sure you wanna</i>
<i> talk to me</i>

30:11.718 --> 30:13.385
<i> -without a lawyer present?</i>
<i> -I am a lawyer.</i>

30:13.479 --> 30:16.054
Was. Kansas.
It was another life.

30:16.190 --> 30:17.314
Yeah, you've had
quite a few of those.

30:17.507 --> 30:19.391
Like a damned cat.

30:19.543 --> 30:20.651
This gun is registered to you.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.228
Or should I say to...

30:23.380 --> 30:24.321
Conchita Terrano?

30:24.514 --> 30:26.306
Also known as you.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.640
<i> RITA:</i>
<i> I said I didn't kill her!</i>

30:27.660 --> 30:28.900
<i> RICK: But your gun killed her.</i>

30:29.053 --> 30:29.976
The same gun we found
in your pantry.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.328
You see the problem here.

30:31.479 --> 30:32.996
I didn't have the gun
when she was shot.

30:33.189 --> 30:34.723
-She had it.
-So how'd she end up

30:34.783 --> 30:36.250
with your gun?

30:38.361 --> 30:41.821
<i> RITA: She was stealing my mail</i>
<i> and using it to blackmail me.</i>

30:41.882 --> 30:43.656
We're done, Delia.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.567
I'm not gonna give you
any more money.

30:45.627 --> 30:47.827
Melvin's gonna notice soon,
and I cannot let that happen.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.087
But he's not gonna notice
the gunshot

30:49.223 --> 30:50.681
when you fire that thing?

30:50.874 --> 30:52.757
Or my blood all over you

30:52.852 --> 30:55.185
when you go home...

30:55.354 --> 30:56.520
after you kill me?

30:56.689 --> 30:58.080
Oh--

30:58.858 --> 31:01.859
And if you broke my gnome,
I'm gonna sue you for that too.

31:02.052 --> 31:04.086
Go home, Rita.

31:04.104 --> 31:05.921
Stick to what
you're good at--

31:06.023 --> 31:08.282
conning stupid men.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.929
RICK: So Delia had your gun
on the night she was killed.

31:13.989 --> 31:16.098
How'd you get it back?

31:17.025 --> 31:18.524
<i> RITA: Melvin and I</i>
<i> were on the porch</i>

31:18.586 --> 31:20.193
<i> -when we heard the shot.</i>
-(gunshot)

31:20.212 --> 31:22.195
-MELVIN: What was that?
-I don't know.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.530
Um...I'm gonna call 9-1-1.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.775
-But you didn't call anyone.
-Uh, yeah.

31:26.835 --> 31:29.219
I thought Delia shot someone
with my gun.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.555
I needed to find out.

31:31.748 --> 31:34.224
<i> Delia kept her place locked,</i>

31:34.417 --> 31:36.727
<i> but John and Joe didn't.</i>

31:36.878 --> 31:39.955
<i> I looked over the fence,</i>
<i> and...</i>

31:40.057 --> 31:42.274
<i> she was dead.</i>

31:43.402 --> 31:44.960
<i> You know the only thing worse</i>

31:44.978 --> 31:46.570
<i> than Delia killing someone</i>
<i> with my gun?</i>

31:46.763 --> 31:48.797
<i> Delia getting killed</i>
<i> by my gun.</i>

31:48.857 --> 31:51.617
<i> I knew how that would look.</i>
<i> I had to get it back.</i>

31:55.289 --> 31:56.413
(Archie whining)

31:56.606 --> 31:58.398
(whispering) Not now, Archie.

31:58.459 --> 32:00.542
-(barking)
-(gasps, whispers) Seriously?

32:03.780 --> 32:05.905
Hey, Archie!
Archie, Archie.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.316
Go get it.
Good boy.

32:08.418 --> 32:11.244
(sirens wailing distantly)

32:11.305 --> 32:15.248
<i> (suspenseful music)</i>

32:15.309 --> 32:17.208
Okay.
Oh, God.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.011
(sirens approaching)

32:20.105 --> 32:21.997
<i> RICK: That's a hell of</i>
<i> a story, I'll give you that.</i>

32:22.015 --> 32:23.256
<i> (phone chimes)</i>

32:23.317 --> 32:24.849
<i> You got anything</i>
<i> to back it up?</i>

32:24.985 --> 32:27.669
Well, there's the dog toy.

32:27.729 --> 32:29.429
I'll have the officers
take you back.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.281
(phone chimes, buzzes)

32:33.285 --> 32:34.676
<i> Uh, just a second.</i>

32:34.695 --> 32:36.528
Could you show me
your hands, please?

32:36.622 --> 32:38.622
Thank you.

32:40.075 --> 32:42.350
ATHENA: You believe her story?

32:42.369 --> 32:44.352
It might sound crazy,
but I kinda do.

32:44.413 --> 32:45.854
Why'd you ask me
about her hands?

32:45.872 --> 32:47.780
Ballistics mentioned
that a piece of fingernail

32:47.841 --> 32:49.115
got caught in the gun slide.

32:49.218 --> 32:52.210
Rita had all her fingernails.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.620
But our victim didn't.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.549
Delia was holding the gun
when it was fired.

32:57.685 --> 33:01.386
Think about it.
On the 9-1-1 call, she said...

33:01.480 --> 33:04.055
Okay, fine! If you people
aren't gonna handle this,

33:04.191 --> 33:05.965
I'll have to do it myself.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.559
<i> RICK: So she's had enough.</i>

33:07.711 --> 33:09.561
She wants to put the fear
of God into her neighbors.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.155
She grabs the gun, but before
she can go out into the street,

33:12.348 --> 33:13.548
she's confronted by someone.

33:13.650 --> 33:15.217
<i> -She spins around.</i>
-Hey!

33:15.235 --> 33:16.660
<i> -ATHENA: She's startled.</i>
-Hey! Stop!

33:16.853 --> 33:18.144
<i> RICK: She trips over</i>
<i> her damn garden gnome.</i>

33:18.205 --> 33:19.571
<i> ATHENA: She loses her balance.</i>

33:19.723 --> 33:21.540
<i> RICK: And then the gun</i>
<i> goes off.</i>

33:23.985 --> 33:25.836
It's not the craziest story
I ever heard.

33:26.029 --> 33:27.320
It's definitely close.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.747
Okay, so the only thing
we don't know

33:28.841 --> 33:30.007
is who she was yelling at.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.249
Everybody else
is accounted for.

33:31.401 --> 33:32.509
They were all
at the block party.

33:32.702 --> 33:34.753
-(Archie whining)
-Not...everyone.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.905
Ss, ss, ss, ss.

33:36.965 --> 33:40.183
RICK: The dog was in her yard.
That's who she was shouting at.

33:40.376 --> 33:42.577
I gotta put that
in my report.

33:42.596 --> 33:43.854
Don't worry, Archie.

33:44.005 --> 33:47.190
Not a jury in the world
is gonna convict.

33:51.521 --> 33:54.439
Well, I'm just glad
everybody's okay.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.183
PHILLIP: You all seem to have
very dangerous jobs.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.426
Not really.
I mean, most of the time,

33:58.445 --> 33:59.811
it's pretty run of the mill.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.429
CHIMNEY: Yeah.
And Stan wasn't a bad guy.

34:01.490 --> 34:03.765
He just...needed someone
to see him.

34:03.825 --> 34:06.601
To understand
how much pain he was in.

34:06.661 --> 34:08.937
He probably wasn't
gonna blow the place up.

34:08.997 --> 34:11.773
Still seems...very risky.

34:11.833 --> 34:15.277
I mean, from what I hear,
Evan has spent

34:15.337 --> 34:17.888
quite a lot of time
in hospitals.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.475
From what you hear?

34:22.886 --> 34:25.044
'Cause you coulda come.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.122
Seen for yourself.

34:27.182 --> 34:28.881
Evan, I've told you--

34:28.901 --> 34:31.401
You, uh, you're not good
with hospitals.

34:31.553 --> 34:32.736
I got it.

34:32.887 --> 34:35.054
I'm not good seeing my children
in them.

34:35.115 --> 34:37.365
-You don't know!
-MADDIE: Mom, Mom.

34:41.604 --> 34:43.305
I'm fine.

34:43.365 --> 34:45.807
I'm ready for dessert.

34:45.826 --> 34:48.643
PHILLIP: Oh, Howard, where'd
you put that box we brought?

34:48.703 --> 34:50.754
-Dad, more gifts?
-Not exactly.

34:50.947 --> 34:54.216
It's over by the couch.
Let me grab it.

34:55.877 --> 34:57.152
I like him, Maddie.

34:57.212 --> 34:58.744
Me too.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.246
You picked a good one
this time.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.990
-Mom--
-What?

35:02.050 --> 35:03.416
It was a compliment, Evan.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.519
-Oh, was it?
-Ugh!

35:10.317 --> 35:12.150
Your baby box.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.022
MARGARET: I thought
you might wanna pass on

35:18.175 --> 35:20.692
some of these things
to your little girl someday.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.344
Aw!

35:22.404 --> 35:24.362
Oh, this is cool.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.772
I-I didn't know
you made these for us.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.291
When do I get mine?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.464
Hey, you're not even
a grown up yet.

35:34.616 --> 35:36.967
They're probably still
adding stuff to it.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.119
You thought
we'd throw it away?

35:40.180 --> 35:41.787
MARGARET:
We may not have agreed

35:41.849 --> 35:43.974
with all the choices you made,
Maddie,

35:44.167 --> 35:47.978
but we never gave up hope
that you'd come to your senses.

35:48.171 --> 35:49.813
And you did.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.441
You never gave up hope?

35:54.477 --> 35:57.970
Evan, let's not do this.

35:58.031 --> 36:01.232
United front, remember?

36:01.326 --> 36:02.993
You guys didn't even
go to her wedding.

36:03.186 --> 36:04.736
Oh.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.497
She was making
a terrible mistake.

36:07.649 --> 36:11.075
-We told her that.
-Yeah, people make mistakes.

36:11.228 --> 36:13.152
Doesn't mean
you give up on 'em.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.562
But you did.

36:14.623 --> 36:16.840
She married Doug,
and you cut her off.

36:17.033 --> 36:18.249
PHILLIP: At the time,

36:18.343 --> 36:21.085
we thought it was...
for the best.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.755
MARGARET: We didn't know
what was going on.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.182
I swear, Maddie.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.184
We didn't know
he was hurting you.

36:27.377 --> 36:29.186
Well, you should have.

36:29.379 --> 36:30.854
You shoulda known!

36:31.047 --> 36:32.430
You shoulda
known!

36:32.524 --> 36:34.432
You were right there
in the same town.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.918
How could you not know?
Actually, you know what?

36:36.937 --> 36:38.603
Maybe it does track,

36:38.697 --> 36:40.755
'cause you barely knew what was
going on with your own kids

36:40.774 --> 36:44.183
when we<i> were</i> under
the same roof.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.828
Maybe you never
gave up hope...

36:48.765 --> 36:51.625
You sure as hell
gave up on her.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.505
You gave up on both of us.

36:59.742 --> 37:03.220
Oh, and, uh, and you wanna know
why I'm really in therapy?

37:03.388 --> 37:07.057
It is because I have spent
my entire life

37:07.250 --> 37:09.451
feeling like
a constant disappointment.

37:09.511 --> 37:11.453

37:11.513 --> 37:13.063
You think my job is dangerous?

37:13.256 --> 37:15.381
I have<i> walked</i> through fire

37:15.484 --> 37:17.734
every single day of my life
because of you.

37:17.927 --> 37:19.385
That is why I am in therapy.

37:19.446 --> 37:20.812
Because nothing I ever did

37:20.964 --> 37:22.722

-PHILLIP: We tried.

37:22.824 --> 37:25.891

-You never made it easy on us.

Either one of you.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.746
We were supposed to?
We were kids.
