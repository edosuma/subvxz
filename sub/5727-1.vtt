<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

00:39.438 --> 00:43.868
<i>Fire. The whole house is on fire.</i>

00:44.926 --> 00:48.022
<i>What's the address of the fire?</i>

00:49.498 --> 00:53.428
<i>I can't hear you. 911.
What's the address of the fire?</i>

00:56.254 --> 00:58.750
<i>Sir, what is the address?</i>

00:59.050 --> 01:00.886
<i>Yours.</i>

01:56.248 --> 01:57.283
<i>Good morning, Atlanta.</i>

01:57.383 --> 02:00.968
<i>There's a beautiful sunrise outside
if you're up at this early hour</i>

02:01.068 --> 02:04.306
<i>lighting up the A skyline
across Midtown and Buckhead.</i>

02:04.406 --> 02:06.592
<i>But what about the south of the city?</i>

02:06.692 --> 02:10.783
<i>Yeah, that's right, today is
the big day, the result of our poll...</i>

02:20.439 --> 02:21.950
Mommy.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.905
It's okay, baby.

02:47.516 --> 02:48.987
Cassie!

03:13.475 --> 03:16.445
- You look funny!
- Well, you have my nose and lips,

03:16.545 --> 03:19.782
so I would probably think
of a better word to describe me.

03:19.882 --> 03:22.952
- You shouldn't wear that.
- Why not?

03:23.052 --> 03:26.021
That shirt with those shoes?
Uh-huh, girlfriend.

03:26.121 --> 03:28.690
Oh, yeah? And where did you go
to fashion school, Missy?

03:28.790 --> 03:30.486
Miss Summers' art class.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.563
Well, I'm not taking fashion tips from
a 10-year old. Now, go grab your bag.

03:34.663 --> 03:37.158
It's the new twelve.

04:05.827 --> 04:09.464
- Where did you find that?
- In the garbage.

04:09.564 --> 04:11.334
Well, it's not yours.

04:12.634 --> 04:14.302
Daddy gave it to you.

04:14.402 --> 04:17.356
Cassie, that was a long time ago, okay?
We're not kids anymore.

04:17.505 --> 04:18.807
So?

04:19.207 --> 04:22.377
So, don't argue with me.
Come on, I'm late.

04:22.477 --> 04:24.897
Okay, but I still need $50.

04:24.997 --> 04:27.950
- For what?
- Our career-day field trip.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.211
What? That's today?

04:32.654 --> 04:34.616
Daddy!

04:34.990 --> 04:37.585
Wait! Cassie, I...

04:38.994 --> 04:40.855
Shit.

04:45.434 --> 04:46.902
There's my little lady.

04:47.002 --> 04:49.204
- Daddy!
- Get over here. Come on.

04:49.304 --> 04:50.773
- How you been?
- Good.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.374
- You got a new outfit?
- Yeah.

04:52.474 --> 04:53.942
- Pretty. Look at you.
- Thank you.

04:54.042 --> 04:56.962
I think waiting a week
to see you is too much.

04:57.062 --> 04:58.657
Morning, Pam.

04:59.581 --> 05:02.318
- Hey, Howard.
- Morning, Pammie.

05:04.286 --> 05:06.522
Oh, Dad, can you help me
with my homework?

05:06.622 --> 05:08.140
You know I can.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.261
- You were supposed to finish that yourself!
- Oh, come on, Pam!

05:12.861 --> 05:14.696
Hey, want to go see uncle Howard?

05:14.796 --> 05:17.325
- Yeah.
- Go on, I'll be right there.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.930
- Hey, Pam.
- What is it, Jeremy?

05:23.108 --> 05:25.507
I was just gonna say you look
beautiful today, that's all.

05:25.607 --> 05:28.269
I'm in a rush. What do you want?

05:29.110 --> 05:32.748
The car is in both of our names.
It's affecting the credit, that's all.

05:32.848 --> 05:35.251
- I'll take care of it.
- I didn't mean it like that, okay?

05:35.351 --> 05:38.447
- If you need help, I can...
- We're not married.

05:41.690 --> 05:45.561
- We're not divorced either.
- Not yet.

05:45.861 --> 05:48.696
I think I've said "Sorry" enough,
don't you?

05:48.796 --> 05:52.360
- You left our daughter alone in the house.
- I know.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.938
And for what? So you could take a call?

05:56.038 --> 05:58.983
Hey, Pam, it's been a year, okay?

05:59.741 --> 06:02.103
When are you gonna let it go?

06:18.176 --> 06:21.479
I look forward to seeing you
and Cassie, you know that.

06:22.413 --> 06:26.461
How many times I got to say I'm sorry
if you just stop being crazy-mad at me?

06:29.137 --> 06:33.001
I don't know. How many whiskey sours
does it take to forget?

06:34.976 --> 06:36.811
Nice, Pam.

06:36.911 --> 06:40.675
You, know, I've been sober
for five months. I'm trying, okay?

06:53.661 --> 06:57.766
We have a couple of issues to discuss, so
let's go ahead and get them out of the way.

06:57.866 --> 07:00.402
First, we need to keep
our workplace clean.

07:00.502 --> 07:04.139
Second shift has been complaining
about trash left on our workstations.

07:04.239 --> 07:07.943
- Some of that shit is from third shift.
- Well, be that as it may...

07:08.043 --> 07:10.445
Pamela, nice of you to join us.

07:10.545 --> 07:13.311
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly,

07:13.411 --> 07:16.384
the state is making major cuts
to our staff and benefits,

07:16.484 --> 07:20.455
so I'll be taking over for Richard
for a bit while he is out with the flu.

07:20.555 --> 07:22.991
He'll post the details next week
when he gets back.

07:23.091 --> 07:24.910
So, who got axed?

07:25.010 --> 07:27.629
I'm not privileged
to release that information.

07:27.729 --> 07:29.915
Don't worry, sweetie,
you've only been here two years.

07:30.015 --> 07:31.320
Three.

07:31.420 --> 07:34.761
They're firing employees
with longer tenure and more benefits

07:34.861 --> 07:36.638
for those newer, cheaper workers.

07:36.738 --> 07:38.874
I don't make any decisions.
That's Richard's call.

07:38.974 --> 07:41.877
He and upper management in both
the state police and fire departments

07:41.977 --> 07:44.146
are taking a 40% cut
of their retirement benefits,

07:44.246 --> 07:46.645
so it's not just us who are affected.

07:46.745 --> 07:50.578
Let's just focus on the task at hand
and get to our workstations.

07:52.788 --> 07:56.117
Pamela, could I see you
for a moment, please?

07:59.895 --> 08:01.989
Have a seat.

08:05.901 --> 08:08.963
Seven years and a perfect record.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.567
Do you feel an itch?

08:14.009 --> 08:17.505
How much sleep did you get
last night, Pamela?

08:18.480 --> 08:21.149
- Enough, why?
- You were late.

08:21.249 --> 08:24.845
Second time this week
and fourth time this month.

08:25.387 --> 08:27.281
Five minutes.

08:27.389 --> 08:29.684
It was ten actually.

08:30.292 --> 08:33.788
I requested to review
your psych evaluation.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.232
Do you still dream about the fire?

08:37.631 --> 08:39.460
No.

08:41.336 --> 08:44.573
But you still claim that the caller
burned your house down.

08:44.873 --> 08:49.002
- I listened to the tapes.
- So did I.

08:49.744 --> 08:53.615
And you insist that the caller,
when asked for his address...

08:53.715 --> 08:55.901
said "Yours."

08:56.001 --> 08:59.054
No, he said 110 Hamilton Drive.

08:59.154 --> 09:01.890
It was just the way he said it.

09:01.990 --> 09:04.042
Like he knew it was my house.

09:04.142 --> 09:07.495
It's only when I dream
I hear him say "Yours".

09:07.595 --> 09:09.965
So you're still having a dream.

09:10.065 --> 09:12.526
No, I'm fine.

09:21.609 --> 09:25.239
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, baby. Be good.

09:34.489 --> 09:37.726
- Hey, brother.
- For fuck sake, coffee and doughnuts!

09:37.826 --> 09:40.896
Come on, try it. Green tea is good
for you. Spinach and Chicken Ram.

09:40.996 --> 09:43.498
- Nobody eats this crap.
- In 2015 they do.

09:43.598 --> 09:45.960
It's the last time you go for food.

09:46.634 --> 09:50.824
So, we're having a padlock
on Tuesday if you're interested.

09:52.774 --> 09:55.711
I should have done this
a lot sooner, actually.

09:56.011 --> 09:57.462
Done what?

09:57.562 --> 09:59.781
No liquids by the workstations.

09:59.881 --> 10:02.977
Moved you to an easier district.

10:03.351 --> 10:05.987
Grace, Pamela's gonna be starting today
on the Eastern District.

10:06.087 --> 10:08.376
- Excuse me?
- You'll also cover suburbs and highways...

10:08.476 --> 10:11.763
- Tony! Tony!
- And lot of tress and grass...

10:11.863 --> 10:15.597
Tony! I've worked this station
for nearly 20 years.

10:15.697 --> 10:17.565
Grace, it's just a few days.

10:17.665 --> 10:20.903
You'll take the Northwestern District
then you can give Pam a lunch at noon.

10:21.003 --> 10:25.306
- I can handle the inner city calls, really.
- No, have a seat, sweetie.

10:25.406 --> 10:29.037
- Really, let her have this workstation.
- Don't mind her.

10:31.046 --> 10:33.727
I know you're probably looking
for a raise or promotion, or...

10:33.827 --> 10:36.618
both, but... we're really under
a lot of heat right now,

10:36.718 --> 10:41.689
so, why don't we wait until this smoke clears
a little bit and then we can re-evaluate.

10:41.789 --> 10:44.018
You're a good operator, Pam.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.902
- What's the occasion?
- Occasion?

10:55.002 --> 10:57.339
- In that outfit?
- What's wrong with my outfit?

10:57.439 --> 10:59.007
That white, those shoes?

10:59.107 --> 11:01.610
- Who are you trying to impress?
- My paycheck.

11:01.710 --> 11:05.380
- Yeah, with all the cuts they're making?
- Well, you got to at least try, right?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.649
Make some initiative.

11:07.749 --> 11:10.277
I've read that somewhere.

11:14.189 --> 11:16.455
911. What is your emergency?

11:18.026 --> 11:19.620
911. What's your emergency?

11:37.278 --> 11:39.981
I haven't gotten a call in over an hour.

11:40.081 --> 11:43.878
- Why is it always so slow around lunch?
- Criminals eat, right?

11:47.655 --> 11:49.791
Break time, baby girl.

11:49.891 --> 11:52.034
I've been on break all day.

11:54.161 --> 11:56.690
Don't let Tony catch you with that.

11:58.266 --> 12:01.303
- It's all yours.
- I forgot my mirror. Two minutes?

12:01.403 --> 12:02.536
Follow me, children.

12:02.636 --> 12:06.274
Over here we have one of the city's
most prominent monuments

12:06.374 --> 12:09.737
established in the late 1890's
around the same time

12:09.837 --> 12:12.630
that the city itself was built...

12:27.678 --> 12:31.475
<i>We're good to go and ready
in about ten minutes.</i>

12:42.243 --> 12:44.179
911. What is your emergency?

12:44.279 --> 12:48.183
<i>Such a lovely voice.
Such a calming tone.</i>

12:48.883 --> 12:52.320
I'll bet you don't get told that
very much when people are calling in.

12:52.420 --> 12:56.346
No doubt they are too scared
out their minds to notice.

12:56.446 --> 12:59.494
- Thank you.
- <i>My pleasure.</i>

12:59.594 --> 13:01.229
<i>So, how does this work?</i>

13:01.329 --> 13:06.734
I tell you the crime and the location,
and you send assistance to said location?

13:06.834 --> 13:10.472
If I deem is necessary, yes, sir.
What is your emergency?

13:10.572 --> 13:13.374
<i>No time to waste
when lives are at stake.</i>

13:13.474 --> 13:16.011
You take your job
very seriously, don't you?

13:16.111 --> 13:18.846
Sir, this is a line
for emergencies only.

13:18.946 --> 13:22.550
If you need a help hotline
I'll be more than happy to transfer you.

13:22.950 --> 13:26.120
<i>But I do have an emergency to report.</i>

13:26.220 --> 13:29.185
<i>Suppose I were to tell you
that a serious accident</i>

13:29.285 --> 13:33.728
<i>on the corner of Fifth and Dawkins
is gonna occur in ten minutes</i>

13:33.828 --> 13:36.364
<i>and you can prevent it from happening.</i>

13:36.464 --> 13:39.510
<i>Would I have your attention then?</i>

13:44.772 --> 13:46.327
Oh, my goodness.

13:46.427 --> 13:50.011
- Are we still on the clock?
- You think you have a shot with that?

13:50.111 --> 13:52.180
What are you talking about?
She looked right at me.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.518
- I know what that means. I still got it.
- It means you need new glasses.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.685
She looked right at me.

13:57.785 --> 14:00.255
- What a butt like a ten-year old.
- Really?

14:00.355 --> 14:03.191
You know, you should enjoy her
while you can at that age.

14:03.291 --> 14:06.061
Because right now she thinks
you're the coolest dude on Earth.

14:06.161 --> 14:09.523
- But by middle school it's all over.
- That early?

14:09.623 --> 14:13.167
That early. My daughter started
to call me "pig" in sixth grade.

14:13.267 --> 14:15.429
I wonder why.

14:16.621 --> 14:20.805
Who I am and why I'm doing this
is none of your concern.

14:20.905 --> 14:24.938
<i>What I am prepared to do is
what you should be concerned about.</i>

14:25.346 --> 14:28.984
- Sir, if this is some kind of a prank...
- <i>Then hang up on me.</i>

14:29.084 --> 14:30.985
<i>Oh, that's right!</i>

14:31.085 --> 14:34.589
<i>An emergency dispatch operator
can't disconnect</i>

14:34.689 --> 14:37.985
<i>once the caller has stated
"There's emergency".</i>

14:39.027 --> 14:43.298
No doubt, by now you've tried
discovering my location.

14:43.398 --> 14:45.533
Did you find something interesting?

14:45.633 --> 14:47.669
- Listen, Mister...
- <i>No!</i>

14:47.969 --> 14:49.604
You listen.

14:49.704 --> 14:54.475
Report an accident to the corner
of Fifth and Dawkins over dispatch.

14:54.575 --> 14:58.379
You can believe me or not,
but if you don't,

14:58.479 --> 15:01.216
then the blood of the victims
will be on your hands,

15:01.316 --> 15:03.118
<i>not mine.</i>

15:03.218 --> 15:08.723
By the way, you're down
to four minutes and 53 seconds.

15:08.823 --> 15:10.592
52.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.553
<i>51.</i>

15:16.397 --> 15:17.933
<i>Radio to any available units.</i>

15:18.033 --> 15:20.868
<i>We have possible signal 41 in progress</i>

15:20.968 --> 15:23.671
<i>on 421 Fifth Avenue South.</i>

15:23.771 --> 15:26.433
That's a familiar voice.

15:27.041 --> 15:30.111
Not really. I spoke to her today
first time in a week.

15:30.211 --> 15:32.940
I thought you guys
were patching things up.

15:34.315 --> 15:38.253
She said possible 41 auto accident.
How does that make any sense?

15:38.353 --> 15:41.261
It's 421 Fifth Avenue.
It's close by, let's take it.

15:41.361 --> 15:44.520
Hey, look at it this way. At least now
she'll have to listen to you.

15:47.028 --> 15:50.498
670, Radio. You said a possible 41?

15:50.598 --> 15:54.636
<i>Ten-four 2670. It was a confusing call
on my end as well.</i>

15:55.236 --> 15:57.472
<i>Are you available to go check it out?</i>

15:57.572 --> 16:00.134
Ten-four. En route. Hey.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.925
I'll take a look around.

16:28.753 --> 16:30.548
Radio, this is 670.

16:31.506 --> 16:33.567
<i>Go for Radio.</i>

16:33.841 --> 16:37.412
We're here, there's no sign
of a signal 41, nothing at all.

16:37.512 --> 16:39.947
Did you trace the caller?

16:40.047 --> 16:43.010
<i>Ten four, 2670. I got nothing.</i>

16:45.987 --> 16:47.357
Copy.

16:49.124 --> 16:51.365
Stand by, 2670.

16:51.465 --> 16:54.529
- 911. What is your emergency?
- <i>You tell me.</i>

16:54.629 --> 16:56.731
Listen, I've had enough of your pranks.

16:56.831 --> 17:00.368
Are you aware that is a felony
to prank call an emergency to 911?

17:00.468 --> 17:04.472
<i>Oh, no! A felony?
Well, perhaps I should just stop now.</i>

17:04.571 --> 17:08.309
<i>So, you sent a unit over to the location
like I asked? Did they find anything?</i>

17:08.409 --> 17:12.146
No, nothing. They found nothing
because there is nothing there.

17:12.246 --> 17:15.250
You've wasted my time
and the time of two police officers.

17:15.349 --> 17:18.118
- <i>Are you sure about that?</i>
- Yes, I am sure about that.

17:18.219 --> 17:20.125
<i>Please, stop shouting.</i>

17:20.224 --> 17:24.150
<i>Remember that the primary responsibility
of an emergency operator</i>

17:24.250 --> 17:26.227
<i>is to keep the caller calm.</i>

17:26.327 --> 17:28.329
<i>Check with the officer one more time.</i>

17:28.429 --> 17:31.499
<i>We must be certain before
making any rash decisions.</i>

17:31.599 --> 17:36.050
Radio to 2670, are you certain
there is no sign of an accident?

17:36.150 --> 17:38.800
<i>No sign of a signal 41. Nothing at all.</i>

17:40.608 --> 17:42.103
Prank call.

17:42.577 --> 17:45.639
Wasted time? Let's get out of here.

18:15.776 --> 18:19.139
2670, come back.

18:20.381 --> 18:21.782
Jeremy...

18:21.882 --> 18:25.102
<i>Let me guess. Signal 41.</i>

18:25.202 --> 18:29.316
<i>A car accident. And right on time.</i>

18:29.957 --> 18:33.495
You did this. You made this happen.

18:33.595 --> 18:36.897
<i>Now that is really a stretch.</i>

18:36.997 --> 18:40.335
<i>Good luck explaining that
to your superiors.</i>

18:40.435 --> 18:43.271
<i>I know a lot about you, Pam.</i>

18:43.371 --> 18:46.774
<i>And have a great deal of more surprises
in store for you today.</i>

18:46.874 --> 18:49.777
No, you need to find someone else
to play games with.

18:49.877 --> 18:52.780
I assure you if you had anything
to do with that accident,

18:52.880 --> 18:56.543
you're gonna be very sorry
you ever dialed 911.

19:01.255 --> 19:02.479
Oh, my God!

19:14.335 --> 19:16.329
No!

19:16.429 --> 19:18.304
What do you want?

19:18.940 --> 19:22.910
<i>For you to understand
the fear I will create.</i>

19:23.010 --> 19:25.653
Fear like you've never felt before.

19:25.913 --> 19:28.816
<i>Fear that will scar you for life.</i>

19:28.916 --> 19:32.720
Please, don't hurt her.
I will do anything you want.

19:32.820 --> 19:35.556
I can get you a hostage negotiator.

19:35.656 --> 19:38.759
I don't want a negotiator, Pam.
I want you.

19:38.859 --> 19:41.396
And I want you to cooperate.

19:41.496 --> 19:45.233
- I chose you specifically for this task.
- I can't do this.

19:45.333 --> 19:49.670
<i>Either you'll put the lives
of a few pigs in the line of danger,</i>

19:49.770 --> 19:53.408
pigs that have sworn
to protect and serve.

19:53.708 --> 19:56.077
<i>Or you'll watch
as your daughter struggles</i>

19:56.177 --> 20:00.331
as she's slowly submerged
into the watery depths.

20:00.431 --> 20:02.930
I always liked poetry.

20:03.417 --> 20:05.679
<i>It's your choice.</i>

20:12.810 --> 20:15.272
Jeremy! Don't move!

20:18.833 --> 20:23.404
Look, just fall on me. Just fall.
Go ahead, I got you. I got you. I got you.

20:23.504 --> 20:27.226
There we go, alright. Come on. Come on.

20:28.609 --> 20:34.441
Come on. Alright, come on.
Roll out. Roll over. Come on, man.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.485
Come on, Jerry, let's go!

20:38.185 --> 20:40.387
Alright, just go out.

20:40.487 --> 20:42.916
Son of a bitch, you are lucky!

20:46.461 --> 20:49.130
<i>Now, let's set up the rules.</i>

20:49.230 --> 20:50.865
<i>Rule number one:</i>

20:50.965 --> 20:56.571
<i>You will ignore all incoming calls and
remain on the line with me at all times.</i>

20:56.671 --> 20:59.941
<i>Rule number two:
You will ask nothing of me,</i>

21:00.041 --> 21:03.370
<i>and you will answer any question
that I ask you.</i>

21:04.912 --> 21:07.915
Rule number three: Obey!

21:08.015 --> 21:10.318
You will comply with my every request

21:10.418 --> 21:13.588
and you will see to it
that they're carried out to a tee.

21:13.788 --> 21:17.362
<i>And you will do so without asking
for assistance from your co-workers</i>

21:17.462 --> 21:20.070
like you're attempting to do now.

21:21.395 --> 21:22.897
You can see me?

21:22.997 --> 21:27.402
<i>It's surprising how easy it is
to intercept the video</i>

21:27.502 --> 21:30.971
<i>of a "high security"
state protected building</i>

21:31.071 --> 21:33.741
<i>even from a safe distance.</i>

21:33.841 --> 21:35.877
<i>Take a sip of your coffee.</i>

21:35.977 --> 21:38.271
That's not mine.

21:38.746 --> 21:41.793
I'd hate for something to happen
to your daughter because you're disgusted

21:41.893 --> 21:45.045
by the thought of drinking
after your friend.

21:56.797 --> 21:58.792
You ready?

21:58.966 --> 22:00.727
Yeah.

22:05.339 --> 22:08.502
- Got it, got it.
- Ready?

22:08.809 --> 22:10.637
Freeze!

22:14.915 --> 22:16.977
I will shoot!

22:23.290 --> 22:24.818
Shit.

22:29.246 --> 22:31.008
Nothing.

22:36.837 --> 22:39.507
Nothing. Did you see anything?

22:39.607 --> 22:41.609
I was pulling you out of the car.

22:41.709 --> 22:44.363
It's some kind of hit and run, man.

22:45.580 --> 22:48.849
Thanks, buddy. He came straight at me.

22:50.351 --> 22:52.233
Better call back-up.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.990
- <i>Radio 670 requesting code 21.</i>
- What do I say?

22:56.090 --> 23:00.161
<i>An officer is calling for back-up, Pam.
So, send him some back-up.</i>

23:00.261 --> 23:01.929
Ten-four 670.

23:02.029 --> 23:05.136
<i>The accident didn't happen until we got here.
What the hell is going on?</i>

23:05.236 --> 23:08.695
- Careful.
- I don't know.

23:09.103 --> 23:14.409
Radio to any available units. I'm requesting
code 21 to 421 Fifth Avenue south.

23:15.509 --> 23:18.799
<i>Ten-four Radio. This is 26040. En route.</i>

23:18.899 --> 23:20.831
See, that wasn't so hard, was it?

23:21.081 --> 23:24.551
Sorry about that. It's not easy
looking beautiful all the time.

23:24.651 --> 23:27.060
- Are you ready for that break now?
- <i>Ignore her.</i>

23:27.160 --> 23:29.740
It's okay.
I'm in the middle of a call, so...

23:29.840 --> 23:32.227
- I'll take it over.
- No, she won't.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.048
No, really, I'm gonna finish this one.

23:34.148 --> 23:36.631
- Just give me the call, Pam.
- <i>Deal with her!</i>

23:36.731 --> 23:40.701
I know you're trying to get a raise. But you
don't have to impress the callers, too.

23:40.801 --> 23:44.105
- I'm warning you.
- It's not that. I just want to finish this call.

23:44.205 --> 23:48.175
- Enough, Pam. Get up!
- Get rid of her now!

23:48.275 --> 23:50.170
Hell, I could use a 15.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.776
I just hate office drama.

23:58.285 --> 24:00.687
<i>The officer you were speaking to...</i>

24:00.787 --> 24:03.991
- <i>he's quick</i>
- He's just a cop doing his job.

24:04.091 --> 24:07.061
<i>I think he understands
what we're trying to accomplish.</i>

24:07.161 --> 24:10.131
We? I don't even know
what you're trying to accomplish.

24:10.231 --> 24:13.368
<i>I'd like to report another crime.
Property damage.</i>

24:13.468 --> 24:16.404
<i>It's 1731 Weathervane Drive.</i>

24:16.504 --> 24:20.425
- <i>Send 2670 to check it out.</i>
- He was just in an accident.

24:20.725 --> 24:25.139
Besides, a cop can't leave the scene of
the crime when he's the first to respond.

24:26.647 --> 24:28.716
Are you still there?

24:28.816 --> 24:31.853
<i>Figure something out.
I'm not gonna do your job for you.</i>

24:31.953 --> 24:36.715
- <i>If he isn't at the scene in five minutes...
</i>- Okay. Okay.

24:37.091 --> 24:40.853
Just don't hurt her.
I'll see what I can do.

24:42.196 --> 24:45.667
Okay, guys... guys! So you had to check
out an accident and then it happened.

24:45.767 --> 24:48.969
Yeah, man, like I just told you.
Home-boy here plowed straight into me.

24:49.069 --> 24:51.238
Wait a second.
That doesn't add up at all.

24:51.338 --> 24:54.191
- No shit!
- <i>Radio for 2670.</i>

24:54.291 --> 24:57.445
- Go for 670.
- <i>I've got a lead on that suspect.</i>

24:57.545 --> 25:00.981
<i>Somebody spotted him
at 1731 Weathervane Drive</i>

25:01.081 --> 25:03.417
<i>requesting a code 12.
Are you able to pursue?</i>

25:03.517 --> 25:05.937
Confirm that. That cruiser
was damaged in the crash.

25:06.037 --> 25:09.156
We're gonna be cruising in
Cruiser 644 from this point.

25:09.256 --> 25:11.881
Hold on! Wait! Are you out of your mind?

25:11.981 --> 25:15.329
- You can't leave the scene of an accident.
- Unless we're pursuing a suspect.

25:15.429 --> 25:16.578
For?

25:16.678 --> 25:20.335
- Attempted homicide with a vehicle.
- You don't know what the hell he looks like.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.331
That's what we're going to find out.
Are you coming?

25:30.527 --> 25:32.263
Well done, Pam.

25:32.363 --> 25:36.300
That police officer, do you know him?

25:36.400 --> 25:40.755
- Why would I know him?
- You called him by his name.

25:40.955 --> 25:43.316
<i>Jeremy I think it was.</i>

25:45.426 --> 25:47.528
I heard it over the radio.

25:47.628 --> 25:49.797
Are you attracted to him, Pam?

25:50.197 --> 25:52.865
I know the names
of a lot of police officers.

25:52.965 --> 25:54.502
I talk to them all the time.

25:54.602 --> 25:57.204
Doesn't mean that I know them
or that I am attracted to them.

25:57.304 --> 26:02.009
And if he has another mishap, and can
no longer walk away from the scene.

26:02.109 --> 26:05.645
Or if he is killed
in the line of duty...

26:05.885 --> 26:07.428
tell me, Pam...

26:08.015 --> 26:11.544
<i>would you shed a tear
for officer Jeremy?</i>

26:13.053 --> 26:14.681
No.

26:45.018 --> 26:48.088
- What day of the week is it?
- Friday.

26:48.788 --> 26:51.191
So where the hell is everybody?

26:51.291 --> 26:55.862
- Long weekend, maybe.
- Nah, I don't think so. Something's up.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.833
Let me have a look around.
Make sure no one leaves here.

26:58.933 --> 27:00.827
Copy that.

27:21.055 --> 27:24.684
Anyone here? Police officer!

27:30.197 --> 27:31.665
670 for Radio.

27:32.065 --> 27:36.035
- <i>Go, 670.</i>
- We got a code 23.

27:36.603 --> 27:38.572
Nobody here, it's empty.

27:38.672 --> 27:41.234
Hey, Howard, you got anything?

27:42.026 --> 27:44.354
No, I got nothing.

27:56.156 --> 27:58.585
You got to be kidding me.

28:02.696 --> 28:04.591
Williams!

28:14.741 --> 28:17.044
2670, please, come in.

28:17.144 --> 28:19.514
<i>I don't think he copied.</i>

28:19.614 --> 28:22.216
- You son of a bitch!
- <i>Watch him.</i>

28:22.594 --> 28:25.121
- Then leave me alone, you sick...
- We got a 10-33!

28:25.221 --> 28:27.989
10-33, officer down! We need backup now.

28:28.089 --> 28:29.557
Ten-four, 670.

28:29.657 --> 28:34.295
All units, all units! We have a 10-33.
It's 1731 Weathervane Drive.

28:34.395 --> 28:36.413
Officer down.

28:58.953 --> 29:00.947
Easy, partner.

29:03.456 --> 29:06.393
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

29:06.493 --> 29:08.955
What about Williams, where is he?

29:13.700 --> 29:15.803
<i>Jeremy, Howard, do you copy?</i>

29:15.903 --> 29:19.873
<i>670 for Radio, we're okay.
We might have a possible 10-54 here.</i>

29:19.973 --> 29:24.515
- <i>We need backup right now.</i>
- Ten-four. They're on the way.

29:25.646 --> 29:28.515
<i>You even know the name of his partner.</i>

29:28.615 --> 29:31.085
<i>You do care about this one.</i>

29:31.185 --> 29:35.455
They'll find you. Do you know
what they do to cop-killers in prison?

29:35.555 --> 29:39.226
<i>For me to go to prison
I would have to get caught first.</i>

29:39.326 --> 29:41.362
<i>But I have no intention
of getting caught.</i>

29:41.462 --> 29:45.266
You underestimate him. He will find you.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.030
He?

29:47.130 --> 29:51.037
Who's he? Pam, tell me...

29:51.257 --> 29:53.136
is the hero going to barge in,

29:53.236 --> 29:56.610
<i>in his police blues
and throw handcuffs on the bad guy?</i>

29:56.710 --> 29:59.013
<i>Is that how it's going to play out?</i>

29:59.113 --> 30:03.284
How many times have you received
an emergency call from a bad neighborhood

30:03.384 --> 30:05.653
only to discover that the police
wouldn't go there

30:05.753 --> 30:08.289
<i>simply because they're not
guaranteed their safety?</i>

30:08.389 --> 30:12.541
<i>Or have your ever been walking home,
heard a scream of someone calling for help.</i>

30:12.641 --> 30:14.528
<i>What do you do?</i>

30:14.628 --> 30:16.497
Do you rush to their assistance?

30:16.597 --> 30:19.666
Or do you put your head down
and just keep walking?

30:19.766 --> 30:24.105
<i>We're all bad guys, Pam.
We're all complicit in crimes.</i>

30:24.405 --> 30:27.341
<i>We turn a blind eye to death everyday.</i>

30:27.441 --> 30:29.710
<i>No one weeps for the victims.</i>

30:29.810 --> 30:33.440
We only care when it happens
to someone important to us.

30:34.114 --> 30:37.451
- You're insane.
- <i>Am I?</i>

30:37.551 --> 30:40.620
Or am I the only one with clear head?

30:40.720 --> 30:42.850
The only difference between you and I

30:42.950 --> 30:46.653
<i>is that I have the conviction
to go after what I want.</i>

30:47.227 --> 30:50.230
And on that note,
I have another crime to report.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.091
No.

30:52.366 --> 30:54.794
No, I'm done helping you.

31:02.408 --> 31:05.272
- Are you there? Did you hear me?
- <i>Watch your screen.</i>

31:14.037 --> 31:16.257
No. No, please.

31:17.357 --> 31:20.260
- Please stop.
- <i>Mommy! Help!</i>

31:20.360 --> 31:25.654
<i>Remember, a 911 call operator
must remain calm at all times.</i>

31:25.754 --> 31:28.469
Please. Stop, I'll do whatever you want.

31:28.569 --> 31:31.505
<i>I understand your hesitations, Pam.</i>

31:31.605 --> 31:33.540
<i>But don't for a second think</i>

31:33.640 --> 31:37.311
<i>that I am not prepared
to do what is necessary.</i>

31:37.411 --> 31:40.239
<i>Don't defy me again!</i>

31:42.582 --> 31:44.218
What do you want me to do?

31:44.318 --> 31:48.055
<i>Send officer Jeremy and his partner
to 12 Westmont Circle.</i>

31:48.155 --> 31:50.483
<i>Breaking and entering.</i>

32:18.152 --> 32:21.243
The only cop I knew who used
to take his kids to school every day.

32:28.328 --> 32:31.157
He used to play
with Cassie all the time.

32:32.316 --> 32:35.511
We all end up the same way
sooner or later.

32:37.837 --> 32:39.766
He played us, you know that?

32:41.275 --> 32:43.570
Waiting for us to get to the scene.

32:45.445 --> 32:47.481
Why do you say that?

32:47.581 --> 32:49.476
Read this.

32:58.208 --> 33:00.694
Jesus Christ, why didn't you
tell me about your daughter?

33:00.794 --> 33:02.846
Don't you think we should call this in?

33:02.946 --> 33:06.967
He's got dispatcher, hears everything.
Every damn thing we say.

33:07.067 --> 33:08.812
No.

33:08.912 --> 33:11.071
<i>2670.</i>

33:11.171 --> 33:12.776
Go, 670.

33:12.876 --> 33:16.176
<i>I've got a report of a signal 42
at 12 Westmont Circle.</i>

33:16.276 --> 33:20.180
- <i>Are you available to check it out?</i>
- Looks like it's just you and me, Howie.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.109
This asshole can't know we're on to him.

33:24.551 --> 33:27.120
- Okay?
- Right.

33:27.220 --> 33:29.915
Ten-four. We're on our way.

33:35.395 --> 33:38.425
- What?
- <i>Incoming.</i>

33:42.135 --> 33:43.537
Aren't you gonna answer that?

33:43.637 --> 33:46.206
<i>You better do something.
She's making a scene.</i>

33:46.306 --> 33:49.476
- How many calls did you put on hold?
- Grace.

33:49.576 --> 33:51.512
What are you waiting for?
Answer the damn thing.

33:51.612 --> 33:54.415
I'm... No!

33:54.515 --> 33:56.843
<i>Hello, are you really there?</i>

33:58.885 --> 34:01.227
You just hung up on them.

34:01.327 --> 34:04.174
- You bitch.
- What the hell is going on here?

34:04.424 --> 34:06.660
- She's ignoring callers.
- That's not true.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.696
- Grace, I don't...
- Tony. Tony.

34:09.795 --> 34:12.498
What are you, nine years-old?
Enough drama.

34:12.599 --> 34:16.503
- She's ignoring callers.
- If she were, I would know about it.

34:16.603 --> 34:20.460
Alright, everyone, thank you very much.
Back to work, please.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.601
Take a 15.

34:26.146 --> 34:30.183
- Hello. 911. What's your emergency?
- <i>You broke rule number one!</i>

34:30.283 --> 34:33.420
- My co-worker pressed the button.
- <i>Don't let it happen again.</i>

34:33.520 --> 34:37.724
<i>This is 670. ETA to the location
is approximately three minutes.</i>

34:37.824 --> 34:39.859
Ten-four, 670.

34:39.958 --> 34:43.563
<i>Are you sure there isn't something
going on between the two of you?</i>

34:43.664 --> 34:47.601
<i>His last name wouldn't happen
to be Miller, now would it?</i>

34:47.701 --> 34:50.637
If you already know it is,
then why are you asking me?

34:50.737 --> 34:54.507
<i>No questions. You've been lying to me.</i>

34:54.608 --> 34:57.611
I didn't lie. We're separated.

34:57.711 --> 34:59.079
<i>Is he handsome?</i>

34:59.179 --> 35:03.209
He has brown hair, blue eyes.
He's a good...

35:07.186 --> 35:11.253
- He's a thoughtful man.
- <i>And yet you're not with him!</i>

35:11.353 --> 35:14.000
<i>Is he a crooked cop?</i>

35:14.100 --> 35:16.563
No, he's a good person.

35:16.663 --> 35:18.764
<i>Then why, Pam?</i>

35:18.864 --> 35:21.447
<i>Why aren't you with him?</i>

35:23.870 --> 35:26.736
<i>Alright, that's enough for now.
Compose yourself.</i>

35:26.836 --> 35:30.106
<i>You don't need anyone asking questions.</i>

35:37.917 --> 35:40.212
We're almost there.

35:40.554 --> 35:42.949
Something on your mind?

35:43.590 --> 35:45.058
Yeah, sure.

35:45.158 --> 35:48.594
He's got my wife and daughter.
Can't do anything about it.

35:48.694 --> 35:50.924
Untraceable numbers.

35:51.631 --> 35:54.060
The guy's just covering his tracks.

35:55.602 --> 35:59.106
The thing is when I was working as state
detective before we rode together,

35:59.206 --> 36:02.601
we had this case,
untraceable numbers, dozens of them.

36:02.943 --> 36:06.739
You can't break them.
Even got the FBI involved.

36:07.047 --> 36:11.171
So, some idiot is pulling prank phone calls
and you couldn't find him. Big deal.

36:11.271 --> 36:12.462
Howard, think about it.

36:12.562 --> 36:16.318
To go to this much trouble
is gonna be a bigger pitcher, right?

36:17.857 --> 36:21.762
Like hacking into security cameras
of a state operating building, right?

36:21.862 --> 36:23.623
Exactly.

36:24.297 --> 36:26.416
What happened with you and Pam?

36:26.516 --> 36:29.269
That night, with the fire,
with Cassie nearly got killed...

36:29.369 --> 36:31.338
hit me hard, you know.

36:31.438 --> 36:34.967
I went off the deep end,
I got suspended, I got demoted.

36:35.108 --> 36:38.345
- This is how you ended a bag in uniform.
- Sure.

36:38.445 --> 36:42.015
Pam left you because
she blames you for the fire?

36:42.115 --> 36:45.211
She blames me because
I wasn't there that night.

36:46.069 --> 36:49.249
- She had a point.
- What the hell is this?

36:53.593 --> 36:55.822
- I'll take the back.
- Copy.

36:58.832 --> 37:01.894
Is anyone in here? Anyone?

37:09.009 --> 37:10.377
Anyone here?

37:10.477 --> 37:14.648
670, Radio, we have a signal 33
at 12 Westmont, Code 3.

37:14.748 --> 37:17.343
Anyone here? Police officer!

37:21.988 --> 37:25.017
Police officer. Anyone need help?

37:26.760 --> 37:30.490
Hey, wait, wait, wait! We have
a possible 10-70 heading eastbound.

38:23.983 --> 38:27.120
Where's my daughter?
My daughter, where is she?

38:27.220 --> 38:29.649
The hell are talking about, bitch?

38:30.924 --> 38:35.128
- I ain't got no kid.
- You've been targeting cops all day. Why?

38:35.228 --> 38:38.324
What are you talking about?
You're the first I seen all day.

38:38.765 --> 38:42.068
Okay. What were you doing here?

38:42.168 --> 38:46.019
Somebody paid me. I... Somebody
paid me. I don't know his name.

38:46.119 --> 38:47.896
I was supposed to be there
an hour before,

38:47.996 --> 38:51.277
set fire to the place and make it
look like an accident, okay.

38:51.377 --> 38:54.170
But it took too long and you...
You caught up with me.

38:54.270 --> 38:58.210
- Look, I swear, I...
- Shut up! Just shut up!

39:05.725 --> 39:08.020
What'd he look like?

39:08.762 --> 39:12.132
I don't know. Normal. White guy.

39:12.232 --> 39:16.796
Look, he may be on the streets. Today's
the first day I met him, okay? Now just...

39:26.779 --> 39:29.549
- What are you doing?
- I thought he had your gun.

39:29.649 --> 39:32.978
You're a police officer.
How're you gonna explain this?

39:33.619 --> 39:37.190
- 670. 670, Radio.
- Go for Radio.

39:37.290 --> 39:41.136
<i>I have a suspect down on code 33.
Requesting fire and the EMT to location.</i>

39:42.779 --> 39:45.742
Jesus Christ, Howard,
you can't just shoot a suspect.

40:10.223 --> 40:11.918
What do you think?

40:13.859 --> 40:17.123
The poor kid was just a pawn.
Had no idea what he was into.

40:18.464 --> 40:20.600
$10,000 is a lot of money
for this kind of job.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.696
Somebody wanted them pretty bad?

40:25.738 --> 40:29.168
- Georgia National.
- What?

40:30.744 --> 40:32.605
Couldn't be.

41:04.710 --> 41:07.180
Hey, Howard. Howard.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.875
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah.

41:10.416 --> 41:12.878
Here, take a look at this.

41:16.622 --> 41:18.558
That doesn't make any sense.

41:18.658 --> 41:21.227
What are you talking about?
It makes perfect sense.

41:21.327 --> 41:23.096
That untraceable call case
I told you about,

41:23.196 --> 41:26.432
six of the same bank branches
were hit by the those numbers.

41:26.532 --> 41:30.003
When they torched my house, all the
security files of the bank were in my home.

41:30.103 --> 41:31.671
Coincidence? You know what I think?

41:31.771 --> 41:33.840
Same people behind it.
It's all shit all along.

41:33.940 --> 41:37.369
Jeremy. Jeremy, take a breath.
Take a breath.

41:37.871 --> 41:40.903
This is too close to home for you,
I know they got your daughter but listen,

41:41.003 --> 41:44.051
everything we've done today
we can answer for, but this...

41:44.151 --> 41:46.853
dispatch hasn't sent us,
and we don't have probable cause.

41:46.953 --> 41:48.655
We're talking about my daughter here.

41:48.755 --> 41:50.924
She's seen their faces.
You think they're gonna let her go?

41:51.024 --> 41:53.026
But you don't even know
if she's gonna be there.

41:53.126 --> 41:56.463
You've convinced yourself she's there,
'cause you want to be the one who saves her.

41:56.563 --> 41:59.858
You don't know that
and if you're wrong, she's dead.

42:00.333 --> 42:03.970
<i>Send your officers
to 3814 Willow Street.</i>

42:04.070 --> 42:07.240
- What's the crime?
- <i>A shooting, suspected. A gang activity.</i>

42:07.340 --> 42:09.909
Can't I send someone else?
They've got their hands full.

42:10.009 --> 42:11.865
<i>Do as you're told.</i>

42:11.965 --> 42:15.382
Oh, yeah, they'll kill her. As soon
as they won't need her for leverage.

42:15.482 --> 42:18.192
- As long as we do what he says...
- <i>Radio to 2670.</i>

42:18.292 --> 42:20.821
- ...she's gonna be fine.
- Okay. Go for Radio.

42:20.921 --> 42:24.957
<i>I've got a report for code 25
at 3814 Willow Street.</i>

42:25.057 --> 42:28.261
<i>Possible gang related.
Are you available to check it out?</i>

42:28.361 --> 42:31.557
Let's take it, let's take it
and let's play along.

42:34.100 --> 42:38.068
Ten-four. En route.
Hey, Howard, I'll drive.

42:38.168 --> 42:40.139
<i>Anarchy, chaos.</i>

42:40.339 --> 42:43.694
<i>Haven't you ever wondered what would happen
if the safety parameters</i>

42:43.794 --> 42:47.481
<i>that society puts in place for us
were simply removed?</i>

42:48.081 --> 42:50.887
What if you called 911...

42:50.987 --> 42:52.602
<i>and no one answered?</i>

42:52.752 --> 42:55.548
Then a lot of innocent people would die.

42:56.456 --> 42:58.991
Of course you'd say that,

42:59.091 --> 43:01.631
but you're not talking about safety,

43:01.731 --> 43:04.097
you're talking about shackles.

43:04.197 --> 43:08.384
Don't you see you can't force
a person to do anything?

43:08.484 --> 43:12.839
You'd have to get them to buy into a system,
but every system has an organizer,

43:12.939 --> 43:15.241
a person who wields control.

43:15.341 --> 43:17.543
And what about those people
you killed today?

43:17.643 --> 43:19.479
I didn't say no one would die.

43:19.579 --> 43:23.876
Simply that I would return man
to its true nature.

43:25.118 --> 43:28.194
At the end of the day you're no more
special than the hundreds of criminals

43:28.294 --> 43:29.956
this office deals with.

43:30.056 --> 43:34.119
I think you're just too weak
to fit into your so-called system.

43:34.594 --> 43:37.857
Well, then it seems
you've figured me out.

43:41.334 --> 43:43.496
I'm impressed.

43:53.079 --> 43:56.108
What are you doing?
Willow Street is to the south.

43:56.316 --> 43:58.384
We're not going to Willow,
we're going to the bank.

43:58.484 --> 44:01.821
You're out of your mind? What's gonna happen
when we don't show up at the other location?

44:01.921 --> 44:03.623
He knows we're going to Willow, right?

44:03.723 --> 44:06.492
By the time we get to the bank,
we'll be too late.

44:06.592 --> 44:10.130
You don't know how many people could be
there. We could be walking into an ambush.

44:10.230 --> 44:14.460
If you don't want to do this, don't want
to back me up... she's not your daughter.

44:21.140 --> 44:26.305
It's my wife. If I'm gonna die today, I want
to tell her I love her one more time.

44:27.980 --> 44:31.818
- <i>They should have been there by now.</i>
- Maybe they hit some traffic.

44:31.918 --> 44:34.387
<i>I don't think they're going
where I told them to?</i>

44:34.487 --> 44:38.184
- You heard them on the call.
- You lied.

44:40.226 --> 44:43.289
And it's created a serious
fucking problem for me.

44:49.735 --> 44:52.739
I can fix it.
I can fix it, let me fix it.

44:52.839 --> 44:58.111
Such an adorable girl! Perhaps she'll be
more adorable if she's a lifeless corpse.

44:58.211 --> 45:00.817
I'll do anything you want me to do.
What do you want me to do?

45:00.917 --> 45:04.684
Convince them, Pam.
Convince them to go to Willow Street,

45:04.784 --> 45:07.900
or you'll watch
her goddamn head under water.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.990
- Do it now!
- <i>Mommy! Help!</i>

45:11.090 --> 45:14.260
2670, confirm you are en route
to Willow Street.

45:14.850 --> 45:17.597
<i>ETA approximately three minutes.</i>

45:18.097 --> 45:19.492
Hurry!

45:38.851 --> 45:40.946
Turn these off.

46:07.547 --> 46:10.416
- Anything?
- I can't see shit.

46:10.516 --> 46:14.650
- Do you want to go on the other side?
- I'll radio you when I'm in place.

46:14.750 --> 46:16.482
Go.

46:17.924 --> 46:20.064
<i>Where the hell are they?</i>

46:46.852 --> 46:48.647
Ready for this?

46:49.388 --> 46:51.283
I'm in position.

46:52.025 --> 46:53.685
Go!

46:58.097 --> 47:00.092
Police!

47:58.791 --> 48:01.086
No! No!

48:08.901 --> 48:12.428
Please! No! No!

48:12.772 --> 48:15.909
Who hired you? Where's my daughter?

48:16.409 --> 48:18.177
Who're you talking about?

48:18.277 --> 48:21.707
- Who hired you?
- I ain't telling you shit.

48:22.448 --> 48:26.285
Don't come any closer.
I'll blow this bitch's brains out.

48:26.385 --> 48:29.254
Let her go. Put the weapon down.

48:29.354 --> 48:31.607
You have no idea
what's going on here, do you?

48:31.707 --> 48:34.236
I will take the shot.

48:36.111 --> 48:38.849
Let her go. It's the only way
you can walk out of here.

48:41.066 --> 48:44.763
Put it down! You didn't
sign up for this. Put it down!

48:46.272 --> 48:49.735
Put it down. Put it down.

48:51.410 --> 48:53.772
Good. Drop it!

49:07.260 --> 49:09.087
Dead.

49:11.964 --> 49:13.792
Great.

49:15.134 --> 49:18.304
- I had the shot.
- Yeah, I see that.

49:18.404 --> 49:20.723
Also, the only person who
might have known where she is.

49:24.043 --> 49:26.179
Fuck, Howard.

49:26.279 --> 49:27.874
Where are you going?

49:51.971 --> 49:53.377
She's not here.

50:03.248 --> 50:07.653
- <i>They went to the Bank, didn't they?</i>
- What the hell are you talking about?

50:07.753 --> 50:10.089
<i>You like doing things your own way?</i>

50:10.189 --> 50:13.485
<i>Well, it's time you learn
the consequences.</i>

50:13.959 --> 50:16.098
Hey, come on.

50:16.198 --> 50:20.430
Okay? Okay? Alright? Alright?

50:20.530 --> 50:23.569
Come on. Here you go.

50:23.669 --> 50:25.605
You've done this before, right?

50:25.705 --> 50:28.767
Alright, the EMT's
will be here any second.

50:43.689 --> 50:48.261
I was foolish to believe a cop would be
competent enough to follow simple commands.

50:48.361 --> 50:53.032
So, no more games, no more crimes
reported over dispatch.

50:53.232 --> 50:57.937
Tell officer Jeremy to get the money
that my men were taking from the bank

50:58.337 --> 51:01.407
and meet me at 643 Hawthorne.

51:01.507 --> 51:05.578
I repeat, 643 Hawthorne Street.

51:05.678 --> 51:07.947
Tell him to come alone.
It will be a civil exchange.

51:08.047 --> 51:10.861
He gives me the cash money,
I give him Cassie.

51:10.961 --> 51:13.593
- Let me see my daughter.
- <i>I make the rules.</i>

51:13.693 --> 51:17.149
No. If you want me to cooperate,
then let me see her.

51:20.225 --> 51:24.263
<i>Next time you fail to cooperate, she goes
all the way under. You understand?</i>

51:24.363 --> 51:26.999
How am I supposed to deliver
a message if I can't use the radio?

51:27.099 --> 51:32.164
<i>Why don't you use that cell phone
you've been texting him with all day?</i>

51:37.710 --> 51:40.146
He can't just walk out of there
with all of that money.

51:40.246 --> 51:43.308
<i>He has a gun, doesn't he?</i>

51:46.151 --> 51:48.154
- Pam?
- Jeremy.

51:48.254 --> 51:50.123
Are you okay?
You said you couldn't call.

51:50.223 --> 51:53.526
- <i>Are you at the bank?</i>
- Yeah. Hey, look, Cassie's not here.

51:53.726 --> 51:57.030
- Didn't you get my text?
- No, I had to turn it off when I came in here.

51:57.130 --> 51:59.028
You had to be the one to save the day.

51:59.128 --> 52:02.334
I'm not to be a hero, okay?
I'm trying to save our daughter.

52:02.434 --> 52:04.763
Now he's nearly killed her.

52:06.438 --> 52:11.444
<i>He wants you to bring the money
to 643 Hawthorne Street. Alone.</i>

52:12.244 --> 52:15.314
He says he's gonna give you Cassie
in exchange for the money.

52:15.414 --> 52:18.684
<i>Jeremy he is not
screwing around anymore.</i>

52:18.784 --> 52:23.956
I know. You get it...
Hey, I love you, okay?

52:24.056 --> 52:26.418
Just go get Cassie back.

52:30.362 --> 52:31.777
You're not gonna like it.

52:31.877 --> 52:34.634
I haven't liked anything
you've done all fucking day.

52:35.077 --> 52:37.579
Are you gonna back me up on this?

52:39.772 --> 52:41.966
- Yeah.
- Good.

52:42.107 --> 52:43.876
Everybody...

52:43.976 --> 52:46.038
on the floor. Now!

52:51.050 --> 52:52.778
You!

52:55.020 --> 52:57.049
Are you the manager?

52:58.023 --> 53:00.118
Come with me.

53:01.059 --> 53:02.601
<i>I must applaud your efforts.</i>

53:02.701 --> 53:07.266
<i>I thought you're going to use desperation,
but guilt is a much stronger motivator.</i>

53:07.366 --> 53:10.436
What do you care?
I'm just a pawn in your game.

53:10.536 --> 53:14.640
You know, the funny thing
about pawns and games, Pam,

53:14.740 --> 53:17.342
the king is usually miserable.

53:17.442 --> 53:21.314
Too many things to do,
too many consequences to weigh,

53:21.414 --> 53:23.916
too many people depending upon him,

53:24.016 --> 53:26.878
and too many people
plotting against him.

53:27.886 --> 53:30.122
<i>Count your blessings, Pam.</i>

53:30.222 --> 53:32.918
Not every one has what you have.

54:04.957 --> 54:07.451
- What are you doing?
- I don't care what he says.

54:07.551 --> 54:11.163
We're not going there without backup.
The dispatch is compromised.

54:11.263 --> 54:13.468
Stanton, this is Howard.

54:13.568 --> 54:16.636
Listen, I need a big favor.
You got to call in every man you can.

54:16.936 --> 54:20.289
Have them meet us half a block
south 643 Hawthorne street.

54:20.389 --> 54:22.158
Stay out of view of the building.

54:22.308 --> 54:25.337
No, don't use the radio
to organize this.

54:26.211 --> 54:28.781
- Is he gonna do it?
- Yeah.

54:28.881 --> 54:30.776
Excellent.

54:32.450 --> 54:35.154
What do you think we got back there?
Two, three million?

54:35.254 --> 54:37.236
Probably more like four.

54:37.336 --> 54:40.176
Could buy a beautiful house with that.

54:40.626 --> 54:43.228
Tempting, isn't it?

54:43.328 --> 54:45.757
They got my daughter, Howard.

55:13.025 --> 55:15.928
<i>I hope Jeremy follows
his instructions this time,</i>

55:16.028 --> 55:19.164
<i>because this is your last chance
to see your daughter.</i>

55:19.264 --> 55:20.633
He will.

55:20.933 --> 55:23.635
<i>That's what you said last time.</i>

55:23.735 --> 55:27.573
That was just a miscommunication.
It's not gonna happen again.

55:27.673 --> 55:29.842
I'm gonna have to let you go.

55:29.942 --> 55:34.313
- What about our deal?
- <i>I'll still be listening and watching.</i>

55:34.413 --> 55:36.715
<i>So see to it that there are no surprises</i>

55:36.815 --> 55:41.780
<i>and that this transaction with your
husband is completed as promised.</i>

56:02.307 --> 56:03.635
Stanton.

56:09.915 --> 56:12.644
- What's going on?
- A ransom.

56:14.052 --> 56:16.255
- There's money in there?
- They've got his kid.

56:16.355 --> 56:18.891
Let's just keep our eye
on the prize, okay?

56:18.991 --> 56:20.987
I go in, give them the money,

56:21.087 --> 56:23.662
- get my daughter back.
- Shouldn't we set up a perimeter?

56:23.762 --> 56:28.033
This guy was one step ahead of us
all day. He sees you, she dies.

56:28.133 --> 56:30.536
- I don't like this.
- Now, this is my daughter!

56:30.636 --> 56:34.089
We haven't scouted the location,
we don't have a perimeter,

56:34.189 --> 56:38.110
and you got us working this off the book.
Why isn't the captain involved in it?

56:38.210 --> 56:41.046
We have a compromised dispatch,
one police officer's been killed.

56:41.146 --> 56:42.715
We don't know who we can trust anymore.

56:42.815 --> 56:45.234
Let me go in there,
get my daughter to a safe zone.

56:45.334 --> 56:47.753
You can take it from there
and handle it how you want.

56:47.853 --> 56:50.515
I'm just asking you to wait here.

56:51.190 --> 56:53.018
You good?

57:18.651 --> 57:20.853
911, what's your emergency?

57:20.953 --> 57:23.388
<i>Hello, are you really there?</i>

57:23.988 --> 57:27.710
Yes, ma'am, this is 911 dispatch.
What is your emergency?

57:27.810 --> 57:29.695
<i>Bank robbery,
there's a bank robbery happening.</i>

57:29.795 --> 57:33.966
Ma'am, calm down. The police are aware
of the robbery, it's been dealt with.

57:34.066 --> 57:36.801
<i>No, you don't understand,
it's happening right now.</i>

57:36.901 --> 57:40.172
- <i>Two guys with guns are holding us hostage.</i>
- Ma'am, that's impossible.

57:40.272 --> 57:43.676
<i>Listen, you bitch, I've been trying
to get through for the last 40 minutes.</i>

57:43.776 --> 57:45.844
<i>They're taking everything.</i>

57:45.944 --> 57:49.481
<i>I'm at Georgia National Bank,
228 Crenshaw Blvd.</i>

57:49.581 --> 57:54.519
- Excuse me, where did you say you were?
- <i>Georgia National, 228 Crenshaw Blvd.</i>

57:54.619 --> 57:57.455
But that's... that's impossible!

57:57.555 --> 58:00.459
<i>Sorry? Are you listening to me?</i>

58:00.559 --> 58:02.248
911, what is your emergency?

58:02.348 --> 58:04.196
<i>Two men have taken over
Georgia National Bank.</i>

58:04.296 --> 58:08.266
- What's your location?
- <i>1462 Farragut Drive.</i>

58:08.366 --> 58:11.770
- 911, what is your emergency?
- <i>We've got a bank robbery.</i>

58:11.870 --> 58:16.001
- Which bank?
- <i>Georgia National 4658 Coakley Street.</i>

01:00:43.555 --> 01:00:47.351
This is 670 to SWAT. No one's here.

01:00:48.743 --> 01:00:51.038
I repeat, no one's here.

01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:03.542
What do you have?

01:01:03.642 --> 01:01:06.211
Foot prints up top.
They cleared out, man.

01:01:06.311 --> 01:01:08.781
- Is that sure?
- Yeah, ten-four.

01:01:08.881 --> 01:01:12.610
- He knows the protocol.
- Thanks again, man.

01:01:18.423 --> 01:01:21.660
- Pam?
- <i>Jer... it's not...</i>

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.762
I can't hear you. Baby?

01:01:23.862 --> 01:01:26.031
Cassie's gone, okay?
He's playing us again.

01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:27.799
<i>I know...</i>

01:01:27.899 --> 01:01:31.463
No, look, baby, I can't hear you.
Hang on, hang on.

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.252
Pam.

01:01:47.352 --> 01:01:49.922
- Pam, you hear me?
- <i>Don't...</i>

01:01:50.022 --> 01:01:51.924
Jesus Christ.

01:01:52.424 --> 01:01:54.693
- Pam!
- <i>Don't go in.</i>

01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:59.531
What are you talking about?
No one's here. Cassie's not here.

01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:03.702
<i>It's a trap. He's not hitting one
of the banks. He's hitting all of them.</i>

01:02:03.802 --> 01:02:06.531
<i>They're all getting taken right now.</i>

01:02:15.313 --> 01:02:17.442
Shit! Get out of here!

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:29.737
Jeremy?

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.235
Jeremy!

01:02:37.335 --> 01:02:39.864
Jeremy, can you hear me?

01:03:04.762 --> 01:03:07.566
- <i>Do I have your attention now?</i>
- Why?

01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:12.367
- He did everything you asked him to do.
- Because he didn't come alone.

01:03:12.467 --> 01:03:14.473
<i>You know how it makes me feel, Pam?</i>

01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:17.942
It makes me feel
like you think I'm a pawn.

01:03:18.042 --> 01:03:19.945
<i>Like you think this is all a game</i>

01:03:20.045 --> 01:03:23.128
- and that you are the chess master.
- <i>I told him to go alone.</i>

01:03:23.228 --> 01:03:26.396
<i>They called in for SWAT team
to back them up. I counted 20 of them.</i>

01:03:26.496 --> 01:03:28.729
- 20?
- <i>21 casualties...</i>

01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:33.284
- <i>if you include our officer Jeremy.</i>
- You're gonna burn in hell for this.

01:03:34.192 --> 01:03:38.456
<i>Careful, Pam.
You still have a job to do.</i>

01:03:40.064 --> 01:03:43.502
What the hell makes you think I'm
gonna do anything you ask me to do?

01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:47.231
<i>Because I'll blow your kid's
fucking head off if you don't.</i>

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.876
It's your job to remain calm, not mine.

01:03:51.276 --> 01:03:56.073
I suggest you compose yourself unless you
want to lose a second family member.

01:03:56.173 --> 01:03:59.654
Pam... are you okay?

01:04:00.819 --> 01:04:03.114
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:04:05.023 --> 01:04:06.739
That's right.

01:04:07.726 --> 01:04:10.846
Because I still need you, Pam.

01:04:10.946 --> 01:04:12.474
My accomplice.

01:04:13.481 --> 01:04:15.710
<i>I couldn't have done this without you.</i>

01:04:16.768 --> 01:04:20.140
You're the one who sent officer Jeremy
and his partner to those scenes

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.500
before the crimes happened.

01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:27.479
<i>And you're the one who told them
to take the money from the bank.</i>

01:04:27.579 --> 01:04:30.916
And you're the one who sent
those officers to their death.

01:04:31.016 --> 01:04:35.353
And now, the only one who can
corroborate your story is dead.

01:04:35.453 --> 01:04:38.949
I never would have helped you.
You threatened my daughter.

01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:44.522
Fear is what drives mankind
to his greatest accomplishments.

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:51.052
Only someone with the nerves to overcome
his fear can scale the highest mountain...

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:53.714
<i>when a lesser man wouldn't dare.</i>

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.269
Or rob ten banks simultaneously.

01:04:59.978 --> 01:05:03.214
No doubt you've figured it out by now.

01:05:03.314 --> 01:05:07.776
It's a shame you didn't figure it out
in time to save Jeremy.

01:05:11.856 --> 01:05:13.692
<i>Tell me...</i>

01:05:14.092 --> 01:05:15.739
<i>are you still afraid?</i>

01:05:17.462 --> 01:05:21.433
- What should I do?
- <i>One more crime to report.</i>

01:05:21.533 --> 01:05:26.705
Call in a hostage situation
at 1296 Faulkner Blvd.

01:05:26.805 --> 01:05:28.967
The Emergency Dispatch Center.

01:05:35.614 --> 01:05:37.916
Who's taking the hostages?

01:05:38.016 --> 01:05:41.612
You are. Convince them, Pam.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.403
Radio to all available units.

01:05:58.503 --> 01:06:01.999
This is dispatch operator Pamela Miller.

01:06:02.373 --> 01:06:06.744
I've taken the Dispatch Center
of Faulkner Blvd. under my control.

01:06:06.844 --> 01:06:09.906
And I have a number of hostages.

01:06:11.483 --> 01:06:13.435
<i>I am the criminal behind the events</i>

01:06:13.535 --> 01:06:17.384
<i>that took the lives of two civilians
and a number of police officers.</i>

01:06:18.523 --> 01:06:21.359
<i>As many of you know,
my husband, officer Jeremy Miller</i>

01:06:21.459 --> 01:06:25.589
<i>used to be a state police detective
before being demoted.</i>

01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:31.696
<i>He was so dedicated to his job that he put
the safety of our daughter in jeopardy.</i>

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:36.031
<i>And afterward he was simply cast aside.</i>

01:06:36.574 --> 01:06:38.777
<i>We're all disposable.</i>

01:06:38.877 --> 01:06:43.516
<i>It is only through fear that we are able
to get the attention of those with power.</i>

01:06:44.516 --> 01:06:48.779
My plans to rob Georgia National Bank
earlier were stopped.

01:06:49.687 --> 01:06:53.017
So I want my money brought to me here.

01:06:53.608 --> 01:06:57.037
Or I will begin executing hostages.

01:07:00.331 --> 01:07:02.392
That is all.

01:08:05.897 --> 01:08:07.659
I thought you had the flu.

01:08:10.318 --> 01:08:11.913
Where is she?

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.868
Where is my daughter?

01:08:19.243 --> 01:08:20.444
Calm down, Pam.

01:08:20.745 --> 01:08:23.197
- Hey!
- Back off!

01:08:23.296 --> 01:08:24.349
It's okay.

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:28.078
Everybody, just relax.
Everybody calm, stay down.

01:08:28.219 --> 01:08:32.439
- Oh, you've really done it now, Pam.
- How did you block that call?

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:37.462
Blocking its source is easy
if you're in control of the system.

01:08:37.562 --> 01:08:41.832
But I needed a cell phone to coordinate
with my people in the field.

01:08:41.933 --> 01:08:46.073
I just didn't anticipate that you'd find
that number. Well done, Pam.

01:08:46.174 --> 01:08:48.973
Where is she?
Where is my daughter, you son of a bitch?

01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:51.935
Why don't you just relax and sit down?

01:08:54.078 --> 01:08:56.080
Get back!

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.818
This is the man responsible
for the bombings. He has my daughter.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:03.688
I would do no such thing.
You got to be careful, Pam.

01:09:03.787 --> 01:09:06.395
Why would you do this to my family?
Why me?

01:09:06.496 --> 01:09:09.594
- I needed Jeremy, too.
- What?

01:09:09.694 --> 01:09:14.032
A state police detective
investigating a bank chain...

01:09:14.131 --> 01:09:15.934
architecture plans,

01:09:16.857 --> 01:09:18.636
money import transfer.

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:22.566
All I needed to do was to find a way
to get into his computer.

01:09:23.274 --> 01:09:27.011
So... I fed him
a dead end lead that night.

01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:28.680
What night?

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:32.343
Pamela, just... just put the gun down
before someone gets hurt.

01:09:34.018 --> 01:09:37.689
- The night of the fire.
- My daughter was in that house.

01:09:37.788 --> 01:09:41.059
Why don't you listen to Grace, Pam?

01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:43.428
You two were so mad at each other.

01:09:43.528 --> 01:09:46.229
That you didn't even care
what was left in the fire.

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:49.117
Including Jeremy's laptop.

01:09:49.567 --> 01:09:52.970
So, what's your plan?
You're just gonna disappear?

01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:57.642
All the calls in here are recorded.
Eventually that will pin it back to you.

01:09:57.742 --> 01:09:59.844
Like that gun you're holding.

01:09:59.944 --> 01:10:02.539
Guess who is registered to?

01:10:03.047 --> 01:10:04.749
Jeremy.

01:10:04.849 --> 01:10:07.385
It's the one he thought
he lost in the fire.

01:10:07.485 --> 01:10:11.415
So you tell me how are you
going to explain that?

01:10:23.718 --> 01:10:27.071
- Ma'am. Ma'am, put the gun down now!
- I'm not the criminal.

01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:29.341
She's crazy, she's been
sending cops all over...

01:10:29.441 --> 01:10:31.059
Shut up!

01:10:31.159 --> 01:10:34.980
He has my daughter. He took over my line,
you can look at the call logs.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.086
- Look at her, who has the gun?
- Ma'am, put the gun down now.

01:10:38.186 --> 01:10:41.810
I can't. If I do, he's gonna kill her.

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:44.022
- Kill who?
- My daughter!

01:10:44.122 --> 01:10:47.618
He's been robbing the banks
all day. Please!

01:10:51.395 --> 01:10:53.031
Pam, you got to stop this.

01:10:53.531 --> 01:10:55.926
- I thought you were dead.
- I made it out.

01:10:57.135 --> 01:10:59.129
What about Jeremy?

01:11:00.204 --> 01:11:03.567
He didn't make it. We can solve this.

01:11:03.841 --> 01:11:06.437
We can make it right,
but you got to put the gun down, baby.

01:11:08.045 --> 01:11:09.974
Please.

01:11:10.315 --> 01:11:12.909
Think about Cassie, Pam.

01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:15.879
That's it.

01:11:17.388 --> 01:11:19.416
Put it down.

01:11:44.315 --> 01:11:45.817
How'd we do?

01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:49.721
The other nine went down
without incidents. Little over 200 million.

01:11:49.821 --> 01:11:54.218
Good work, baby. Pulled it off.
We still got to get out of the town.

01:11:58.829 --> 01:12:01.199
What about my payment?

01:12:01.299 --> 01:12:03.927
I didn't forget about your payment.

01:12:08.372 --> 01:12:10.267
Thank you.

01:12:21.719 --> 01:12:24.114
Let see what you got.

01:12:33.598 --> 01:12:35.392
Fuck.

01:12:41.973 --> 01:12:43.211
Yeah!

01:13:39.764 --> 01:13:41.491
Hey!

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:54.104
What's going on?

01:14:31.949 --> 01:14:34.018
Baby, it's me.

01:14:34.118 --> 01:14:35.987
- Jeremy?
- Yeah.

01:14:36.087 --> 01:14:37.982
Baby.

01:14:38.082 --> 01:14:40.450
I thought you were dead.

01:14:42.093 --> 01:14:43.995
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

01:14:44.095 --> 01:14:46.731
No. I'm sorry, I never
should have said all those things.

01:14:46.831 --> 01:14:51.402
Come on, I understand, I deserved that.
You have any idea where she is, baby?

01:14:51.502 --> 01:14:53.997
Not without my computer.

01:14:54.972 --> 01:14:56.767
Hang on.

01:15:00.644 --> 01:15:02.947
- Will this work?
- Yeah.

01:15:03.047 --> 01:15:07.543
Got it? We got to go.
We got to go. Come on.

01:15:09.637 --> 01:15:11.732
What was that number?

01:15:12.723 --> 01:15:14.618
Here, baby.

01:15:17.194 --> 01:15:18.830
It's gonna take long, baby?

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.959
Depends if he used the phone
in the last ten minutes.

01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:25.195
He's on it right now.

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:28.506
Highway 11. Eastbound.

01:15:28.606 --> 01:15:30.200
Great.

01:15:36.247 --> 01:15:38.716
I'll call you
when we're a little closer.

01:15:38.816 --> 01:15:41.252
With any luck we're about an hour away.

01:15:41.352 --> 01:15:43.647
Be ready for us.

01:15:44.155 --> 01:15:45.849
Anything?

01:15:47.124 --> 01:15:48.485
Nothing.

01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:53.891
Don't worry, little girl.
You'll be seeing your mother very soon.

01:15:57.735 --> 01:16:00.371
- We're getting close?
- A mile or two at least.

01:16:00.771 --> 01:16:02.432
Shit.

01:16:04.341 --> 01:16:06.896
- What are you doing?
- Calling the precinct.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.839
They can head us off.

01:16:09.981 --> 01:16:11.778
- <i>This is Brody.</i>
- Captain, it's Miller.

01:16:11.878 --> 01:16:13.912
<i>Miller? Jesus. Where have you been?</i>

01:16:14.012 --> 01:16:17.182
You know those guys that took the Georgia
National? We're in pursue right now.

01:16:17.282 --> 01:16:20.324
<i>They just took your ex in custody.
They tell me that she was in on it.</i>

01:16:20.424 --> 01:16:22.744
No, she wasn't. They were using her.

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:27.365
<i>Son, I know this has been an emotional day
for you. We can't argue with the evidence.</i>

01:16:27.465 --> 01:16:30.460
Captain, listen to me.
She's with me right now.

01:16:30.868 --> 01:16:32.904
- Hi, captain.
- <i>I'm sorry, Miller.</i>

01:16:33.004 --> 01:16:36.407
You don't chase the criminals, fair enough.
We're heading Eastbound on 11. Track us.

01:16:36.507 --> 01:16:38.568
- <i>Miller, stop what you're...</i>
- Fucking asshole.

01:16:41.045 --> 01:16:42.739
Baby.

01:16:43.097 --> 01:16:45.099
You're gonna need...
you're gonna need this.

01:16:45.549 --> 01:16:47.151
What? I can't.

01:16:47.251 --> 01:16:49.921
Baby, it's just you and me.
I can't do this without you.

01:16:50.021 --> 01:16:52.743
- No, I've never fired a gun.
- I know that. Listen.

01:16:52.843 --> 01:16:55.685
Soft trigger, two hands.

01:16:56.027 --> 01:16:58.704
They will try and kill us, so you
have a shot. You do not hesitate,

01:16:58.804 --> 01:17:02.130
you take the shot, you hear me?
You hear me?

01:17:04.101 --> 01:17:06.070
We're gonna get her.

01:17:06.537 --> 01:17:09.599
You'll be fine, I promise you.

01:17:12.776 --> 01:17:15.039
- Is that them?
- It's got to be.

01:17:20.784 --> 01:17:24.414
- So, which one is it?
- I don't know, the big one?

01:17:25.256 --> 01:17:26.657
- Are you sure?
- No.

01:17:26.757 --> 01:17:28.552
Hang on.

01:17:40.738 --> 01:17:42.866
- Watch out!
- Shit!

01:18:01.525 --> 01:18:03.620
Shit... get down!

01:18:16.574 --> 01:18:18.335
You're gonna hit them.

01:18:19.109 --> 01:18:21.672
- What, you're gonna hit them?
- Get down!

01:18:31.522 --> 01:18:32.957
- Baby, take the wheel.
- What?

01:18:33.057 --> 01:18:37.421
Take the wheel. Keep it steady, baby.
Baby, steady!

01:19:24.675 --> 01:19:26.535
Watch out!

01:19:29.847 --> 01:19:32.175
Fuck, that's got to hurt.

01:19:59.643 --> 01:20:02.399
Okay, listen. What I tell you.
You see a shot, you take it.

01:20:02.499 --> 01:20:05.541
Stay low, baby. Come on, now. Get down!

01:20:13.324 --> 01:20:16.027
Go around, baby. Get around back.

01:20:16.127 --> 01:20:18.655
Stay low. Stay low. Stay low!

01:21:21.191 --> 01:21:23.461
You're a disgrace to everything
we stand for.

01:21:24.061 --> 01:21:26.463
What are you taking about? Honor?

01:21:26.563 --> 01:21:29.666
I've been wearing
this goddamn uniform for 25 years.

01:21:29.766 --> 01:21:32.262
There's nothing honorable about...

01:21:37.975 --> 01:21:40.303
Just take the money.

01:21:56.693 --> 01:21:59.196
Is this why you did all this?
For the money?

01:21:59.296 --> 01:22:03.059
It's not just about money, Pam.
It's about history.

01:22:03.334 --> 01:22:06.770
No one's ever had the smarts
to take down ten banks at once.

01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:10.867
200 million dollars.
What are you, stupid...

01:22:15.445 --> 01:22:18.716
Don't do this! Jerry, don't do it, man!

01:22:18.816 --> 01:22:21.218
- Where is my daughter?
- She's in there.

01:22:21.318 --> 01:22:24.554
And this time, I'm gonna let her burn.

01:22:39.236 --> 01:22:42.072
Jerry! Don't do this!

01:22:42.172 --> 01:22:46.703
Don't be stupid, man.
It's 200 million fucking dollars!

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.853
Mommy! Help! Help me!

01:22:55.953 --> 01:22:59.349
Somebody, please help me!

01:23:25.916 --> 01:23:27.785
Come on, baby.

01:23:27.885 --> 01:23:31.221
- It's Daddy, come on. Baby.
- Baby.

01:23:31.321 --> 01:23:33.416
Are you okay?

01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:36.852
Come on, baby, breathe. Breathe.

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:11.538
Daddy!

01:24:21.772 --> 01:24:24.918
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>
