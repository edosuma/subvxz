17:39.099 --> 17:44.022
and said, "Have mercy".

17:44.063 --> 17:46.941
Now, that's my spirit.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.941
That's my spirit, see?

17:46.983 --> 17:49.903
Then we cruised into Vegas

17:49.944 --> 17:51.445
checked into Caesars.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.322
Hit the crap tables

17:53.364 --> 17:57.410
hour and a half later,

17:53.364 --> 17:57.410
I'm up $14,000.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.704
Fourteen thousand dollars.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.704
That's a lot of money.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.831
And you have a pretty girl..

18:01.873 --> 18:04.959
...did you, uh, you know?

18:05.001 --> 18:07.253
Yep. Got married.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.591
- Then it got interesting.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.591
- Oh.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.968
We hopped on a jet

18:11.632 --> 18:13.968
for the Big Apple.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.469
- Helicoptered into Manhattan..

18:14.010 --> 18:15.469
- Very nice.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.972
...where we quickly

18:15.511 --> 18:17.972
produced a revival

18:18.014 --> 18:21.183
of the Broadway smash

18:18.014 --> 18:21.183
"Porgie and Bess".

18:21.225 --> 18:22.769
Mm.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.855
You don't believe

18:22.810 --> 18:25.855
a word of this, do you?

18:25.897 --> 18:28.399
Not a syllable.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.818
Well, let's give

18:28.441 --> 18:30.818
the truth a whirl.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.152
Okay.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.197
I met a girl who lives

18:32.194 --> 18:35.197
just down the street.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.325
Um, she wasn't dressed

18:35.239 --> 18:38.325
in red leather.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.620
She had a nice wallet.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.957
So we went to her place, uh,

18:40.661 --> 18:43.957
where I did win $14,000..

18:47.001 --> 18:49.837
...in Monopoly money.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.965
Then I fell asleep on her couch.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.424
You believe that, don't you?

18:55.426 --> 18:57.386
Yeah. I have to.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.723
You put a mile

18:57.428 --> 19:00.723
and a half on the bike.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.642
[laughs]

19:02.683 --> 19:05.144
Jesse, I'm sorry

19:02.683 --> 19:05.144
I was gone so long.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.604
Hope I didn't let you down.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.022
Aw, you didn't let me down.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.065
Now, maybe you didn't have

19:09.107 --> 19:10.858
a wild and crazy adventure

19:10.900 --> 19:12.860
but you had a cute little..

19:12.902 --> 19:16.196
...adventure-ette.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.782
- And you know what I found out?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.782
- Mm?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.367
No matter what I wear

19:17.824 --> 19:20.367
or what I'm riding on

19:20.409 --> 19:21.786
I'm still gonna be Joey.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.580
And you know something?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.580
That's okay.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.959
You're damn right it's okay.

19:28.001 --> 19:31.045
Alright, Big Joe Stud.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.379
Yeah, I guess

19:31.087 --> 19:32.379
I am pretty studly.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.262
Okay, out of my way, dude.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.599
Going upstairs

19:41.514 --> 19:43.599
to take a bubble bath.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.987
Daddy, I love

19:52.859 --> 19:55.987
father-daughter day.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.530
(Danny)

19:56.029 --> 19:57.530
'Me, too, sweetheart.'

19:57.571 --> 19:59.365
But tomorrow

19:57.571 --> 19:59.365
it's back to the real world.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.368
I go back to work

19:59.406 --> 20:02.368
and you girls go to school.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.871
Ah, fudge.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.707
- Goodnight.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.418
Great day, huh, Deej?

20:11.460 --> 20:16.298
Yeah, major fun. It was one of

20:11.460 --> 20:16.298
the best days of my life.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.592
You don't sound all that happy.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.511
I'm happy, honest.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.057
See? These are happy teeth.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.349
I've known that

20:24.098 --> 20:25.349
face since it was

20:25.391 --> 20:27.476
the size of a tennis ball.

20:27.518 --> 20:30.188
That is not a D.J. happy face.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.565
Dad, for the last time,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.565
I'm happy.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.483
Happy, happy, happy, okay?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.989
Okay.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.702
Uh...Steph?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.287
Honey, I'll bet you want to

20:44.744 --> 20:47.287
get yourself a glass of water.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.333
I'm not dumb.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.333
You want me to leave.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.920
Something's wrong.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.672
Sweetie, I promise

20:53.961 --> 20:56.672
if something's wrong

20:56.714 --> 20:58.174
we'll make it all better.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.675
Alright.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.055
But if you need me,

21:01.844 --> 21:04.055
I'll be in the bathroom

21:04.097 --> 21:06.057
drinking water and waiting.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.437
D.J.?

21:11.478 --> 21:13.522
What's going on here?

21:13.564 --> 21:15.942
You don't have to put on

21:13.564 --> 21:15.942
a happy act for me.

21:15.983 --> 21:19.820
It wasn't for you,

21:15.983 --> 21:19.820
it was for Stephanie.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.822
Well, Stephanie's

21:19.862 --> 21:21.822
not here, honey.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.199
What's going on?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.493
It's just hard being brave

21:26.535 --> 21:28.662
for my little sister

21:26.535 --> 21:28.662
all the time.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.748
Like when you couldn't

21:28.704 --> 21:30.748
take me shopping

21:30.790 --> 21:32.499
I felt terrible.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.001
But I couldn't

21:32.541 --> 21:34.001
show it because if

21:34.043 --> 21:35.419
I did, Stephanie would cry

21:35.461 --> 21:38.131
about you missing her recital.

21:39.257 --> 21:43.844
D.J., you are

21:39.257 --> 21:43.844
a terrific big sister

21:43.886 --> 21:48.099
but no one has to put on

21:43.886 --> 21:48.099
an act in this house.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.643
Now, what's bothering you?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.270
I don't know.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.648
Today was so much fun.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.233
You took us horseback riding

21:57.275 --> 22:00.987
to the circus, to Marine World

22:01.028 --> 22:03.614
but I kept getting

22:01.028 --> 22:03.614
sadder and sadder.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.826
What part depressed

22:05.032 --> 22:06.826
you the most?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.619
The circus clowns or Shamu?

22:13.499 --> 22:14.875
Honey, maybe you were sad

22:14.917 --> 22:17.586
for the same reason I was.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.546
You were sad, too?

22:19.588 --> 22:21.174
A little bit.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.092
Because the more fun we had

22:23.134 --> 22:25.052
the more I hated to see it end.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.931
I wish we could have

22:27.429 --> 22:28.931
days like this

22:28.973 --> 22:30.933
all the time.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.894
I really love being with you.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.899
[sighs]

22:35.479 --> 22:38.899
I love being with you, too.

22:38.941 --> 22:42.736
[sighs]

22:38.941 --> 22:42.736
But there is

22:38.941 --> 22:42.736
no easy answer here.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.531
I know you have to work.

22:45.572 --> 22:49.035
I wish I could be in

22:45.572 --> 22:49.035
two places at once but I can't.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.453
[sighs]

22:49.076 --> 22:51.453
Mm.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.169
You know, I feel better.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.545
You do?

22:59.586 --> 23:02.131
Yeah, we didn't solve anything

23:02.173 --> 23:04.884
but just talking about it helps.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.927
It helps me, too.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.263
And, D.J., I promise,

23:06.969 --> 23:09.263
I'm gonna find more time

23:09.305 --> 23:11.349
to spend with you girls.

23:11.389 --> 23:12.850
And anytime you want to see me

23:12.892 --> 23:14.685
you can always

23:12.892 --> 23:14.685
pull me out of school.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.318
Especially if you want to

23:18.939 --> 23:22.318
see me during math class.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.986
[laughs]

23:24.028 --> 23:25.779
Now, that's a D.J. happy face.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.573
Uh, come here,

23:25.821 --> 23:27.573

Hi, honey.
