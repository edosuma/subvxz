WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.337
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.371 --> 00:08.509
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human
and sent it to you.

00:08.541 --> 00:09.743
Dawn.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.412
Okay, your mom's
in recovery.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.679
Is she all right?

00:12.712 --> 00:14.682
Your mother's
going to be fine.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.550
I want to
show you something.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.786
Harder.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.693
-(gasps)
-Buffy.

00:25.725 --> 00:29.663
I have given you
everything I have--
my heart, my body and soul.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.332
I just don't feel it.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.101
They want me back, Buffy.
The military.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.270
I'm leaving tonight.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.610
Riley!

00:51.752 --> 00:54.387
You ever have that feeling
where there's something

00:54.421 --> 00:56.055
you're supposed to do,
and you forgot what it was?

00:57.825 --> 01:02.963
-Nope.
-I've been having that feeling.
I just realized what it was.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.599
Like, three weeks ago,
Riley asked me to borrow
a crescent wrench,

01:05.632 --> 01:09.069
and I keep having
this feeling like I'm supposed
to give it to him.

01:09.102 --> 01:12.373
Well, that's not
going to happen
unless he comes back.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.543
You know, not to get
the crescent wrench.
Just to come back.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.879
I just mean,
sometimes I sort of forget
that he's gone.

01:19.912 --> 01:22.216
It's like, "Where's Riley?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.951
Oh, wait,
the Central Republic
of Where-in-the-Hell."

01:27.420 --> 01:31.391
Xander?
If you ever decide to go,

01:31.424 --> 01:33.326
I want a warning.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.497
You know,
big flashing red lights
and one of those clocks...

01:37.531 --> 01:40.168
that counts down
like a bomb in a movie?

01:40.200 --> 01:43.069
And there's a whole
bunch of colored wires,

01:43.103 --> 01:45.438
and I'm not sure which
is the right one to cut,

01:45.472 --> 01:47.740
but I guess
the green one and then
at the last second,

01:47.775 --> 01:51.179
"No, the red one,"
then click, it stops with
3/10ths of a second left,

01:51.212 --> 01:52.612
but then you don't leave.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.816
Like that, okay?

01:55.848 --> 01:59.420
Check. Big bomb clock.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.721
Come here.

02:09.127 --> 02:12.599
Maybe it's her.
Huh?

02:12.633 --> 02:15.968
Well, maybe it
won't happen to us,

02:16.002 --> 02:17.837
because it's all about
her messing things up.

02:17.871 --> 02:22.175
She couldn't
make it work with Angel,
and then she let Riley go away.

02:22.210 --> 02:25.278
Yeah, relationship debris
is kind of piling up

02:25.312 --> 02:28.549
on the Buffy highway.
Hmm.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.618
Humans make
the same mistakes
over and over.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.721
I saw it when I was
a vengeance demon.

02:33.753 --> 02:36.122
Some guy dumps a girl.
She calls me.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.225
I exact vengeance,
blah, blah, blah.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.027
The next year, same
girl, different guy.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.862
I mean, after you
smite a few of 'em,

02:42.896 --> 02:45.365
you start going,
"My goodness, young lady,

02:45.399 --> 02:47.501
maybe you're
doing something
wrong here too."

02:47.534 --> 02:49.902
I don't think it's
a pattern with her.

02:49.937 --> 02:54.307
No, it's just,
you know,

02:54.341 --> 02:57.344
now that it
happened again,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.913
man number two,

02:59.947 --> 03:01.681
I wonder how she's
dealing with it.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.254
Sister Abigail,
the choir is ready.
Hmm, thank you.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.760
(praying)
(rapid footfalls)

03:14.961 --> 03:18.466
(grunting, growling)
(gasps)

03:33.614 --> 03:34.781
(groans)

03:46.826 --> 03:49.629
(screams)

03:53.266 --> 03:56.603
(stake
clattering)
(sighs)

03:56.637 --> 03:59.573
What-- what--
what was that?

03:59.606 --> 04:01.574
He looked like
a-- a demon.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.211
Yeah, he did.
Are you okay?

04:04.243 --> 04:07.014
Yeah, I think so.
Here.

04:10.082 --> 04:14.722
So, um,
about being a nun.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.923
You know, um,
with the whole...

04:16.956 --> 04:19.927
abjuring the company
of men, you know?

04:19.959 --> 04:23.764
How's that
working for you?
The abjuring.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.434
Um, good.

04:26.466 --> 04:29.437
Yeah, do you
have to be, like,
super-religious?

04:29.470 --> 04:32.340
Well, uh--
How's the food?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.845
(theme music playing)

05:28.060 --> 05:29.497
(grunting)

05:29.529 --> 05:33.199
All right. Switch.
Left lead.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.538
So you really think they
might be able to help us?

05:38.572 --> 05:42.141
If you mean
are they gonna help us find out
something about Glory--

05:42.175 --> 05:44.512
I saw that coming.
You're dropping your shoulder.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.750
The resources that
the Watchers Council
have at its disposal--

05:49.783 --> 05:52.019
I mean, the central library
alone is--

05:52.052 --> 05:54.521
Don't talk about
the books again.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.824
You get all--
and sometimes there's drool.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.860
I'm sorry, but we
have really exhausted

05:59.893 --> 06:02.696
the materials I have here
and we're coming up empty.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.899
And you're--
you're still dropping
your shoulder.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.235
I can see when you're
gonna go with your right.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.271
You're doing it again!

06:11.303 --> 06:14.675
W-wow! Ohh!
Sorry, sorry.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.778
So, Glory's all you're
gonna talk to them
about, right?

06:17.810 --> 06:20.447
Let's-let's take a break.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.249
Answer me.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.752
I'm not gonna mention
Dawn's name. I wouldn't
do that. I promise.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.721
But you're gonna tell
them about the Key?

06:28.755 --> 06:31.358
That Glory's looking
for something called the Key?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.261
Knowing her goal
is-is crucial.

06:34.293 --> 06:37.865
I mean, if anything helps
them uncover her origins,

06:37.898 --> 06:41.233
-her plans--
-I know.

06:41.268 --> 06:44.103
It's just I trust
these Watchers about as far
as you could throw them.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.540
Thank you very much.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.377
I'm just freaked about
the idea of giving them

06:50.409 --> 06:52.879
any information that could
possibly lead them to Dawn.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.949
Truly, Buffy, if I
saw an alternative--

06:55.983 --> 06:58.552
If the Initiative
were still around,

06:58.586 --> 07:01.822
I'd consider using them,
but they're gone.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.593
And then Riley was the last link
we had to the government.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.762
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to, uh--

07:09.797 --> 07:14.735
It's okay. You can
say his name.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.904
I'm doing all right.
These things happen.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.072
People break up
and they move on.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.942
For a while it feels like
the end of the world, you know,

07:22.975 --> 07:25.946
but big picture--
Not so huge.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.817
Not so huge?
I just said it feels like
the end of the world!

07:30.850 --> 07:31.718
Don't you listen?

07:35.154 --> 07:38.191
I'm teasing.
Oh.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.862
Sort of.
I'll be okay.

07:41.894 --> 07:44.632
Well, I do hate to go
if you're feeling badly.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.199
Look, if it helps you
find out something about Glory,

07:47.233 --> 07:50.538
I'm thrilled
to have you gone.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.773
ANYA:
You're going away
for a week?

07:52.805 --> 07:56.375
-That's great!
-Yes, yes, everybody seems
delighted about it.

07:56.408 --> 07:59.211
Well, I get to
run the store, right?

07:59.245 --> 08:02.550
You? Well, there's
quite a lot for one person
to take care of.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.052
Uh, uh, I mean,
the trash men,
for example.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.153
I mean, th-th-they've
been making such a mess
in the back alley

08:07.187 --> 08:09.689
that the recycling
people can't get
in there to collect.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.291
-Well, somebody
has to talk to them.
-I can take care of that.

08:12.324 --> 08:15.461
I'm envious, Mr. Giles.
A trip to England sounds

08:15.495 --> 08:19.533
so exciting and exotic...
unless you're English.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.168
Don't worry about the shop.
We'll take care of it.

08:22.201 --> 08:26.574
-We can open and close,
and we'll deal with everyone.
-We can come by between classes.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.408
Usually I use that time to copy
over my class notes

08:29.442 --> 08:33.312
with a system
of different colored pens,

08:33.346 --> 08:36.515
but it's been pointed out to me
that that's, you know, insane.

08:36.549 --> 08:40.153
-I said "quirky."
-Hello? I work here.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.923
-I'll take care of everything.
-Yeah, Anya can do it.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.659
Thanks, sweetie.
Well said.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.428
Um, Anya, while I
completely trust you,

08:49.461 --> 08:52.665
uh-uh, to take care
of the inventory and the money,

08:52.700 --> 08:54.000
um,

08:54.033 --> 08:58.238
dealing with people
requires a certain,
uh, finesse.

08:58.270 --> 09:02.075
I have finesse!
I have finesse coming
out of my bottom!

09:02.109 --> 09:04.043
I can completely lie
to the health inspector.

09:04.076 --> 09:07.947
I can, you know, distract him
with coy smiles and bribe him
with money and goods.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.216
See there?
She'll be great.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.086
Don't worry, Giles.
I'll help her take care
of everything.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.756
It'll be shipshape.
Better, it'll be "shopshape."

09:16.789 --> 09:20.460
Xander, she's
talking to Giles
like I'm not here.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.429
-Make her stop.
-Perhaps I'd better
call the airline.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.932
I'm just trying to help out.
Xander, tell her!

09:25.966 --> 09:27.967
Schedule an earlier flight back.
Excuse me.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.202
Tell her that I
don't need her help.

09:30.236 --> 09:34.374
-So, how goes the slaying?
-I killed something
in a convent last night.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.046
In any other room,
a frightening declaration.
Here, a welcome distraction.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.413
Tell us all about
the killing, buff.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.817
Pretty standard.
Vampire staking.

09:43.850 --> 09:47.053
Oh! But I met a nun and she
let me try on her wimple.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.489
Okay, now we're back
to frightening.

09:57.264 --> 10:01.735
You! You with the actual
clothing. Who are you?

10:01.769 --> 10:04.604
Dawn! Come look at this.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.673
It's hard
to recognize me, huh?

10:06.706 --> 10:09.609
Whoa.
No more bathrobe.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.511
Mmm, I looked at it today
and there it was,

10:12.544 --> 10:16.182
all fuzzy and blue,
and I just couldn't
stand it anymore.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.751
I don't think the rest of us
will miss it much either.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.788
It was getting
a little ripe, Mom.
Maybe we should burn it.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.658
-It would keep the bugs away.
-It doesn't smell!

10:25.692 --> 10:28.028
Fine, fine, make
your funny jokes...

10:28.061 --> 10:30.963
at the expense of the woman
with a hole in her skull.

10:30.998 --> 10:35.001
Let's go. I think
we've tired her out.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.184
-Whatcha doin'?
-Playing soccer.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.421
Can I hang out
in here?

10:55.654 --> 10:57.423
Don't touch anything.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.166
You took down
his pictures.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.402
Yeah.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.404
I-- I think I would've
done that sooner.

11:12.438 --> 11:16.408
Like, "Boom.
Don't wanna see
that face again."

11:17.778 --> 11:21.749
It wasn't like that.
I was never angry with him.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.318
Okay, that's a lie.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.057
But it's not like I didn't
want to see his face.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.592
I was just starting
to kind of like the guy

11:33.625 --> 11:37.865
and then...
gone. So fast.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.567
It wasn't really
so fast, him leaving.

11:41.600 --> 11:47.206
According to everyone
who isn't me,
it was kind of gradual.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.241
Oh.

11:51.278 --> 11:55.414
Does that make it
any better?
No.

11:55.447 --> 11:58.150
Because you should have
noticed earlier?

12:00.386 --> 12:02.990
Stop being insightful.
It's creepy.

12:09.062 --> 12:13.232
It hurts. In all kinds
of horrible ways.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.302
In the way where
I'm furious at him,

12:16.336 --> 12:18.971
in the way where
I blame myself...

12:20.139 --> 12:22.442
and all the little ways
I imagine

12:22.475 --> 12:24.144
how I could have
fixed things.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.980
It'll get better.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.350
Won't it?

12:31.918 --> 12:32.820
I hope so.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.789
Yes, it has to.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.628
I'll just keep going
like I have been,

12:41.661 --> 12:44.264
and every day it'll
get a little bit better.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.634
Really? Every day?

12:47.667 --> 12:51.538
Not really. But it'll
be better soon.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.441
It still feels
all sudden to me.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.677
With him gone where
no one can talk to him.

12:58.711 --> 13:03.015
But you never know.
Maybe he'll come back.

13:04.716 --> 13:07.086
Maybe he'll
hate the jungle,

13:07.120 --> 13:10.523
or maybe he'll want
to give it another try.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.129
I could say all the things
I didn't get to say.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.965
Um...

13:19.331 --> 13:21.835
There's something
I got to tell you...

13:21.869 --> 13:24.037
about showing you
Riley in that place.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.673
I didn't mean to--

13:31.912 --> 13:33.613
Anyway, I know you're
feeling all betrayed--

13:33.645 --> 13:35.381
by him, not me.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.851
I was trying to help,
you know.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.187
Not like I made him
be there, after all.

13:41.221 --> 13:45.392
Actually trying to help you.
Best intentions.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.297
You know,
pretty state you'd be in,
thinking things are all right

13:50.330 --> 13:53.566
while he's toddling
halfway around the bend.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.504
Oh, I'll insult him
if I want to.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.240
I'm the one who's
on your side.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.174
Me, doing you a favor.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.378
And you being
dead petty about it.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.514
Me, getting nothing
but your hatred

14:07.547 --> 14:09.649
and your venom and--
you ungrateful bitch!

14:09.682 --> 14:11.583
Bitch!

14:42.249 --> 14:44.918
Buffy, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

14:46.418 --> 14:49.022
Good. And--
and hellebore.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.557
It's up
and to the right.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.927
Hellebore.
One of my favorites.
It's powerful stuff.

14:54.961 --> 14:58.565
I tried to use it
to de-rat Amy
and it didn't work,

14:58.597 --> 15:01.400
but I think it
might have made her
really smart.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.971
She keeps giving me these looks
like she's planning something.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.407
Rubbing her paws
together.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.043
Hey, what are
you two doing?

15:11.077 --> 15:14.081
Oh, we're gonna
try out a few spells.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.316
There's this thing
you can do where
you create light,

15:16.349 --> 15:18.951
and we thought,
"What if you could make,
like, simulated sunlight?"

15:18.985 --> 15:21.989
Yeah, so then, you know,
there Buffy is,

15:22.088 --> 15:25.158
middle of the night,
and she finds this
whole nest of vamps,

15:25.192 --> 15:27.394
and then she just
goes "Presto"!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.996
Only it won't
be "presto," exactly.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.232
And voomph!
There's a floating ball
of sunlight.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.102
Vamps get dusty.
You don't want to look
right at it though.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.138
Uh, that's swell,
but you can't
use this stuff.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.307
Giles has only
been gone two days,

15:40.340 --> 15:43.076
and you're already
causing trouble.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.980
-You shouldn't do things
while he's gone.
-You're the fish!

15:47.014 --> 15:50.616
-What?
-The fish in the bowl
in "The Cat in the Hat."

15:50.649 --> 15:52.652
He was always saying
that the-the...

15:52.684 --> 15:55.422
cat shouldn't be there
while the mother was out.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.192
What are you talking about?
It's a book-- this cat
does all this mischief.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.827
It's so cute.
He balances
a bunch of stuff,

16:01.860 --> 16:03.863
including that fish
in the bowl.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.298
And-and--
but don't try it for real
when you're six.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.467
Because then you're
not allowed to have
fish for five years.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.837
You're referencing
literature I have no way
to be familiar with.

16:11.870 --> 16:15.008
You're trying to make me feel
left out, and you're stealing.

16:15.042 --> 16:18.845
I'm not stealing.
I'm just taking things
without paying for them.

16:18.878 --> 16:22.014
In what twisted dictionary
is that stealing?

16:22.048 --> 16:26.019
-Maybe we should just pay.
-Anya, Giles would be
totally fine with this.

16:26.052 --> 16:30.289
Come on. It'll be fun.
We could show you
how to do some stuff.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.025
You could be
floating pencils
by the end of the day.

16:34.193 --> 16:37.364
Sometimes I miss
having powers.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.732
Oh. Oh! I know
what this is!

16:40.767 --> 16:43.403
This is peer pressure!
Any second now
you're gonna make me

16:43.436 --> 16:47.240
-smoke tobacco and have drugs.
-Look how easy.

16:52.010 --> 16:55.414
Hey! Don't float
the merchandise!

16:55.447 --> 16:57.584
(bell jingling)

16:57.616 --> 16:59.918
ANYA:
Stop that!

16:59.951 --> 17:03.056
Hey, look at this.
My two favorite girls.
Three favorite girls.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.159
Xander, Willow's stealing.
She's a burglar.

17:06.192 --> 17:10.163
Right.
The cunning, broad daylight,
in front of everyone burglar.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.066
Xander, I'm just doing
a spell to help Buffy.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.867
Xander, Giles left me
in charge. Tell her.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.204
Hey. Hey.
Judge Xander requesting
a recess here.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.339
You really shouldn't
pull him into this.
Yes, see?

17:20.373 --> 17:23.742
Tara's with me.
Protect me, Tara.

17:23.776 --> 17:27.413
Xander, what I'm doing,
it's a good thing.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.950
And if it doesn't work,
Giles never even needs
to know about it.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.953
Oops.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.223
ANYA:
The cash register!

17:37.257 --> 17:39.959
What did you do with
the cash register?
Dear god!

17:39.991 --> 17:43.296
I'll fix it!
I'll fix it!
 Recursat.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.034
There. All back.
Good as new.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.304
Money. Did you
hurt the money?

17:51.337 --> 17:54.006
Money good?
She endangered
the money!

17:55.575 --> 17:57.943
Of course, that's
what she cares about.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.113
(mimics Anya)
"I like money
better than people.

18:00.146 --> 18:04.717
People can
so rarely be exchanged
for goods and/or services."

18:04.750 --> 18:08.587
She's pretending to be me!
Well, can you even
believe how she's acting?

18:08.621 --> 18:11.223
Okay, you know what?
I'm tired of being
the one in the middle.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.826
-I'm not gonna let you
pull me into this.
-I'm not.

18:13.859 --> 18:17.829
Whatever the issue
is between you two,
just figure it out without me.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.798
Xander, don't go.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.142
You made him mad.
Me?

18:29.175 --> 18:32.144
Tara, who do you think
he was more mad at?

18:32.179 --> 18:35.582
Um, you know?
I think, uh, maybe--

18:35.615 --> 18:38.617
maybe you guys
have some stuff
you need to work out.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.886
You know,
just really talk.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.631
Fleabane.
Fifteen cents.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.335
Salamander eyes.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.569
Ten bucks for 12.
Bargain.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.308
Bindweed.
Ooh,
that's a pricey one.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.977
Would you stop that?
It's very distracting.

19:05.010 --> 19:09.548
Fine. Make your little
ball of sunshine. I'll be quiet.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.385
Good, because this spell
is very sensitive.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.388
Once I begin,
any non-ritual word
can disrupt it.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.625
Fine.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.992
Okay. Here we go.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.737
-Did you start yet?
-Shh! No!

19:30.769 --> 19:32.838
This is it.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.345
Spirits of light,
I invoke thee.

19:38.377 --> 19:41.881
Let the gloom of darkness
part before you.

19:41.913 --> 19:46.184
Let the moonlight be made pale
by your presence.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.086
Spirits--
Is it done?

19:48.119 --> 19:50.522
Shh!

19:50.557 --> 19:56.496
Spirits of light,
grant my wishes.
Sorry, I thought you were done.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.730
Do you wanna
screw this up?

19:58.765 --> 20:03.435
No, no. I'm sure you can
do that all on your own.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.405
Hey, Anya,
whatever really has you mad,
why don't you just say it,

20:06.439 --> 20:09.509
like you do every other
thought that stomps
through your brain?

20:09.541 --> 20:12.178
-I believe
I have said it.
-No, you haven't.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.946
Come on. Let it out!

20:25.825 --> 20:27.660
-(roars)
-(both shriek)

20:33.500 --> 20:34.733
(growls)

20:37.604 --> 20:39.471
(growling)

20:47.246 --> 20:49.981
He's not
a ball of sunshine.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.589
Ah, new semester,
new classes.

20:57.624 --> 21:01.461
Whole new vistas
of knowledge to be confused
and intimidated by.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.496
I think this one's
gonna be kind of fun.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.664
Greek Art is gonna
touch on so many things,

21:05.698 --> 21:08.166
mythology and history
and philosophy.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.770
The professor spit too much
when he talked. It was like
being at Seaworld.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.173
"The first five rows
will get wet."
(chuckles)

21:14.205 --> 21:16.742
That was just, you know,
um, enthusiasm.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.511
It seemed very much
like saliva.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.248
We'll sit farther back
next time.
Hmm. Good plan.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.416
I need to keep this course.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.320
The only other thing
that fits into my schedule is
Central American Geopolitics.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.356
Hmm.
And no, thank you.

21:32.191 --> 21:36.962
I even hear the word "jungle,"
and all I can think of is him.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.298
You know, "Is that
the one Riley's in?"

21:40.333 --> 21:43.001
I really don't need
a daily 2:00 knife in the heart.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.971
Is it that bad?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.973
Sort of.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.542
But I'm starting
to get perspective
on the whole situation.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.712
You know, maybe Riley's
where he's supposed to be.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.982
You know, maybe he needed
to be where he was needed.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.352
Willow says that
things always happen
for a reason.

21:59.385 --> 22:03.288
But you ever notice
people only say that
about bad things?

22:03.321 --> 22:06.157
But not for me
the furrowed brow.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.660
What do you say we
go pick up Willow

22:07.693 --> 22:10.563
and indulge ourselves
in a little after-school
hamburger?

22:10.596 --> 22:13.065
I guess we could.
She might still be
at the Magic Shop.

22:13.098 --> 22:16.368
I was there earlier
and she and Anya kind of got
in this little squabble.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.704
Xander and I
sort of cleared out.
He was pretty upset.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.075
Anya and Xander
are in trouble?
Oh!

22:23.108 --> 22:26.878
No, I said that all wrong.
It was nothing. Willow and
Anya were sort of fighting,

22:26.913 --> 22:29.315
and then Xander kind of
snapped at both of them
and he left.

22:29.347 --> 22:32.218
He left?
Xander left Anya?

22:32.250 --> 22:35.555
Um, no, not left her,
left her.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.056
He just left.

22:37.088 --> 22:39.357
It was only
a little thing. Really.
Little thing?

22:39.392 --> 22:42.429
See, the thing is,
little things get bigger.

22:42.461 --> 22:45.330
You know? And-and--
and if you don't catch
the little thing...

22:45.364 --> 22:47.900
And then, boom! You have
this-this whole huge thing!

22:47.933 --> 22:50.001
Oh, dear.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.371
Not them,
with the little things.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.906
They can't break up!
I think--

22:54.941 --> 22:57.644
They have
a beautiful love.
I think they'll be fine.

22:59.811 --> 23:03.082
(muffled) They have
a miraculous love.
What?

23:03.115 --> 23:06.653
A miraculous love.
(sobbing)

23:08.954 --> 23:11.590
ANYA:
There! That parked car!
We're still on his trail.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.859
I don't even get
how we made that guy,

23:13.893 --> 23:16.194
because-- wow, advanced.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.964
No one made him.
He must have been trapped
in that crystal

23:18.998 --> 23:21.933
and you released him.
I released him?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.369
No, this was
definitely a "we" thing.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.906
Or a "you" thing.
It definitely feels
like a "you" thing.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.643
Look, just find
the reversal spell.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.912
And hurry!
Look what he did
to that lamppost!

23:32.944 --> 23:36.147
I'm trying. Put the top up.
The pages are all blowy.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.916
Well, I don't know how
to put the top up.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.118
I only just figured out
what the left pedal does.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.520
It makes us stop!

23:43.522 --> 23:44.824
You don't know
how to drive?

23:44.856 --> 23:46.893
Why didn't you say you
don't know how to drive?

23:46.925 --> 23:51.063
Well, I couldn't know
if I could until
I tried, could I?

23:51.096 --> 23:54.500
This is very, very bad.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.968
There's an ogre
on the loose--

23:56.001 --> 23:57.836
-Troll.
-What?

23:57.869 --> 23:59.605
Troll on the loose.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.141
Now, hold on.
I'm gonna press
the right pedal harder.

24:02.173 --> 24:04.375
I expect us
to accelerate.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.315
There's a troll on the loose,
and you're gonna crash
Giles's car!

24:09.347 --> 24:11.416
It's likely.
We're going very fast.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.621
You should have listened
to me and not done a spell.
Giles put me in charge.

24:14.653 --> 24:17.690
Giles can be an idiot.
The smart kind, but still.

24:17.723 --> 24:21.027
-Xander agreed.
-Oh, right. Xander
doesn't step out of line.

24:22.193 --> 24:24.963
-Well, what do you
mean by that?
-Nothing.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.502
ANYA:
Willow! Find that
spell quickly!

24:30.537 --> 24:32.872
Whoa. That's gone.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.481
Hey, watch it.
Oh, it's you.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.152
Spike. Don't let me stop you
from not being here.

24:46.184 --> 24:49.055
I was here first,
you know.
Uh-huh.

24:49.087 --> 24:51.022
Go away.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.863
Now, why would
I do that

24:56.895 --> 24:59.798
when it's bugging
you so much
having me here?

24:59.832 --> 25:02.500
They have
chicken wings too.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.703
Also a sort of a
flower-shaped thing

25:04.737 --> 25:07.839
they make
from an onion--
it's brilliant.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.909
Are you talking to me hoping
that I'll get so depressed

25:09.942 --> 25:12.545
that I'll impale myself
on a fork right
in front of you?

25:12.578 --> 25:14.547
Lovely thought.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.915
If I don't hurt you
myself, the chip
wouldn't zap me.

25:16.949 --> 25:20.152
I could eat you that way.
Beat the onion thing
all to hell.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.354
Hey! Those are mine.

25:23.623 --> 25:27.159
My, my. Someone's
in a temper.

25:27.192 --> 25:31.029
This all sympathetic
"commisery" borrowed
from the slayer?

25:31.063 --> 25:34.933
What? No, nothing
to do with Buffy.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.169
So she's all right,
then. Not, uh,

25:37.202 --> 25:39.371
holding grudges.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.406
What are you
talking about?

25:41.440 --> 25:44.611
What does Buffy
have to do with anything?
What grudges?

25:44.644 --> 25:47.078
Oh, yeah. Okay.
No need to talk
about her then.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.115
I'm sure she's
merrily slaying
some pals of mine,

25:49.147 --> 25:52.417
having
a grand old time.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.119
BUFFY:
 This is very bad.

25:54.153 --> 25:57.123
Willow?
Anya?

25:57.155 --> 25:59.157
They're not back there,
either. They're gone.

26:01.326 --> 26:04.130
Buffy, something's been here,
and Willow's gone.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.465
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.
I promise.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.769
Come on. This thing's
probably leaving
a huge trail.

26:18.509 --> 26:21.380
(laughing)
Puny receptacle!

26:21.413 --> 26:23.281
(grunts)

26:25.084 --> 26:28.988
(growls)
You do well to flee,
townspeople!

26:29.020 --> 26:31.790
I will pillage
your lands and dwellings.

26:31.824 --> 26:35.060
I will burn your crops
and make merry sport

26:35.094 --> 26:37.328
with your more attractive
daughters.

26:37.363 --> 26:40.132
(laughs)
Mark my words.

26:41.968 --> 26:45.003
(sniffing)
Ooh! Ale!

26:45.037 --> 26:48.140
I smell delicious ale!

26:50.308 --> 26:53.278
They get in these fights,
and they're both lookin'
at me like I'm the referee.

26:53.311 --> 26:56.749
Also, sometimes I'll say
something about Anya,
and Willow'll get this look,

26:56.782 --> 26:58.951
this, uh, what-the-hell-
do-you-see-in-her look.

26:58.984 --> 27:01.820
I know that look.
A lot of people never
really got Dru, you know?

27:01.854 --> 27:04.355
Well, she was insane.

27:04.390 --> 27:07.492
Then it's like,
well, I get all torn,

27:07.526 --> 27:10.797
because Willow's
my best friend, and I really
value her opinion, but, uh,

27:10.829 --> 27:12.832
Anya's my girlfriend,
you know?

27:12.865 --> 27:15.867
What does the slayer
think of all this
friction in the ranks?

27:15.902 --> 27:19.270
-Can't be good for morale.
-I don't know.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.374
She's a little preoccupied,
maybe.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.375
It's understandable,
what with all the upset,

27:24.410 --> 27:26.878
all the blaming
of innocent bystanders

27:26.913 --> 27:28.948
that got caught up
in the mess.
What?

27:28.980 --> 27:31.217
I mean, did she want
to be made a fool of?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.152
And what does a person
have to do to make it right?

27:33.184 --> 27:34.420
Hey, watch it, mate.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.489
On second thought,
do what you like.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.859
(sniffs)
Ale! Yes!

27:40.893 --> 27:43.261
Ahh, fragrant ale.
Ahh.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.901
So, uh,
think I should run
and get Buffy?

27:48.934 --> 27:52.104
(belches)
Ahh.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.374
(sighs)

27:55.406 --> 27:58.509
Barmaid, bring me
stronger ale

27:58.544 --> 28:02.181
and some plump,
succulent babies to eat.

28:02.213 --> 28:05.852
I'm gonna run and get Buffy,
or maybe you could fight him.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.220
Yeah, I could do that,
but I'm paralyzed with
not caring very much.

28:08.253 --> 28:11.089
You there!

28:11.123 --> 28:13.224
Do you know where
there are babies?

28:13.259 --> 28:16.061
What do you think,
the hospital?
What? Shut up.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.163
Um, listen.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.067
I find myself very hungry.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.269
And when I am hungry,
I grow short of patience.

28:23.301 --> 28:25.703
Well, we can take care
of the hungry.

28:25.738 --> 28:29.708
So, how's about you
just sit down in one
of the sturdier chairs,

28:29.741 --> 28:31.877
and we could
have a calm talk
and something to eat.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.846
Can it be babies?
Well, not so much.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.750
-Ohh.
-But maybe...

28:37.784 --> 28:41.854
some
roast pigs and stags...

28:41.887 --> 28:43.890
and much hearty grog.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.858
They've got
this onion thing.
You cannot appease me!

28:46.893 --> 28:50.930
Do not try! More ale!
(grunts)

28:52.730 --> 28:56.734
Xander,
you shouldn't be here.
There's a troll.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.904
Uh, a big guy?
Hammer?

28:58.938 --> 29:00.906
I think
I noticed him.

29:00.940 --> 29:04.710
I wish Buffy was here.
I'm here.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.913
I wish I had
a million dollars.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.582
-Just checking.
-BUFFY: What's going on?

29:10.615 --> 29:12.884
Where did
he come from?

29:12.919 --> 29:16.955
-Hello, Buffy.
-Willow stole ingredients

29:16.989 --> 29:20.425
and released him
from a purple crystal--
he's a troll.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.096
You did this?
Me? No, we.

29:24.130 --> 29:27.665
I mean, us. Her.
It's very complex.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.500
We can stop him.
Willow, do the spell.

29:29.535 --> 29:33.471
Uh, "Let
the conjuring be--"

29:33.505 --> 29:35.673
Stop!
(growls)

29:35.707 --> 29:38.443
Nobody lets me
finish.

29:38.477 --> 29:42.114
You... told the witch
to do that, Anyanka.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.782
You seem determined
to put an end to all my fun,

29:44.817 --> 29:47.286
just like you always did
when we were dating!

29:52.324 --> 29:55.594
Uh, um--
You dated him?

29:55.626 --> 29:57.829
You dated a troll?

29:57.864 --> 30:00.031
And we're, what,
surprised by this?

30:00.066 --> 30:01.700
Well, he wasn't a troll then.

30:01.732 --> 30:04.303
You know, he was just
a big, dumb guy, and...

30:04.336 --> 30:06.672
you know, he cheated on me,
and I made him into a troll,

30:06.704 --> 30:09.775
which, by the way,
is how I got the job
as a vengeance demon.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.210
(bellowing)

30:11.242 --> 30:13.980
I did not cheat!

30:14.012 --> 30:16.315
Not in my heart.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.284
It was only one wench.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.487
I had had a great deal
of mead.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.622
Next thing I know,
I'm a troll.

30:23.654 --> 30:27.894
Ohh, ohh.
You did this, Anyanka.

30:27.926 --> 30:30.561
-You will die for this!
-But-but...

30:30.596 --> 30:33.832
You seem to enjoy
the-- the being a troll.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.501
I adjusted.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.871
And then what happened?
Witches--

30:38.971 --> 30:42.141
filthy, dirty,
disgusting witches.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.912
They trapped me.
I was imprisoned in
that crystal for centuries.

30:45.944 --> 30:49.347
Ohh! A curse
on all witches!

30:49.381 --> 30:51.983
-All must die!
-Willow, again.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.921
"Let the conjuring be undone,
return the beast
to native form."

30:54.953 --> 30:56.822
Witch,
you must stop!

30:56.855 --> 31:00.092
"Keep him far from us
and ours as long as
my voice shall sound."

31:00.125 --> 31:02.260
(laughing)

31:05.064 --> 31:08.400
-It did not work.
-Wait. "Let the conjuring--"

31:08.433 --> 31:11.269
-(growling)
-(grunting)

31:16.241 --> 31:20.112
-(troll straining)
-(Buffy grunting)

31:20.145 --> 31:22.614
(low growl)

31:31.623 --> 31:33.392
(beams creaking)

31:37.895 --> 31:41.067
(people screaming)

31:51.910 --> 31:53.845
(straining)

31:56.949 --> 31:59.785
Where is he?
Gone.

31:59.817 --> 32:02.554
Xander, follow him.
Anya, Willow, head back
to the magic shop.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.589
Find a spell that will
actually stop him.

32:08.994 --> 32:11.363
(Buffy grunting)

32:14.333 --> 32:15.968
WOMAN:
You're gonna be okay.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.339
-What are you doing?
-Making this woman
more comfortable.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.643
I'm not sampling,
I'll have you know.

32:24.675 --> 32:27.012
Look at all these lovely
blood-covered people.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.082
I could, but not a taste
for Spike, not a lick.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.549
I knew you
wouldn't like it.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.121
You want credit
for not feeding

32:35.153 --> 32:37.123
off bleeding
disaster victims?

32:37.155 --> 32:38.789
Well, yeah.

32:40.058 --> 32:41.393
You're disgusting.

32:43.729 --> 32:47.098
What's it take?
(scoffs)

32:47.133 --> 32:51.136
Hurry up!
I'm taking everything
on relocation spells,

32:51.170 --> 32:53.939
suspension spells,
and, what the heck,

32:53.971 --> 32:57.542
spells to make him
really sleepy, because
slightly better.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.211
Well, in case
we need 'em,

32:59.244 --> 33:00.878
I'm getting more of all
the things you stole.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.481
I didn't--
why do you do that?

33:03.515 --> 33:05.817
What?
You're so rude.

33:05.851 --> 33:07.385
I mean, sure, at first--

33:07.419 --> 33:10.689
ex-demon,
doesn't know the rules.
Well, you been here forever.

33:10.721 --> 33:13.259
Learn the rules.
Rules are stupid.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.826
Great. Whatever.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.563
I just thought
you might be interested

33:17.596 --> 33:19.664
in learning
to act more human.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.833
Some of us enjoy it.

33:21.866 --> 33:26.003
Oh, look for spells with
dimensional portals too.
I am a human.

33:26.038 --> 33:29.875
And there are many humans
who are stranger than me.

33:29.907 --> 33:32.177
Uh-huh, but unless
I'm really wrong

33:32.211 --> 33:34.212
about Crazy Larry
down at the bus stop,

33:34.246 --> 33:36.748
he's probably not gonna
turn Xander into a troll.

33:36.781 --> 33:39.451
Well, that's a very
complicated procedure.

33:41.052 --> 33:44.355
Oh, you think
I'm gonna hurt Xander?

33:44.390 --> 33:48.493
I would never
hurt Xander!

33:48.527 --> 33:51.497
You really think
I would do that.
Anya, it's what you do.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.732
You spent, what,
a thousand years hurting men?

33:54.766 --> 33:57.769
You got your thousand-years-
of-hurting-men gold watch.

33:57.802 --> 34:01.073
I was a demon then,
and I don't even
have any powers now.

34:01.106 --> 34:04.609
-Is this the spell?
-Only if you want him
to double in size

34:04.643 --> 34:07.145
and grow extra arms,
which-- let's not.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.780
And, by the way,
you weren't a demon

34:08.813 --> 34:11.550
when you turned Olaf
into lord of the hammers.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.253
And you managed that.
(huffs)

34:14.286 --> 34:17.021
Also, there's other ways
to hurt Xander.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.724
I don't do magic now.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.759
You're the one with
that kind of power.

34:20.791 --> 34:23.628
In fact, D'Hoffryn
offered you my old job.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.731
You're closer to being
a vengeance demon
than I am.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.199
-Maybe Xander should be
afraid of you.
-Xander's my best friend!

34:28.233 --> 34:30.802
Oh, and you don't want
anyone else to have him.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.938
I know what broke up him
and Cordelia, you know.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.972
It was you
and your lips.

34:35.005 --> 34:38.244
No, it was not!
Well, yes, it was so,

34:38.277 --> 34:40.311
but that was
a long time ago.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.780
-Do you think
I'd do that again?
-Why not?

34:42.813 --> 34:45.317
Well, hello? Gay now.

34:45.351 --> 34:48.853
But you're always doing
everything you can to point out
how much I'm an outsider.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.623
You've known him since you were
squalling infants together.

34:51.657 --> 34:54.492
You'll always know him
better than I do.
You could sweep in

34:54.525 --> 34:56.927
and poison his mind
against me.
You're insane.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.063
I am not gonna
take him away,

34:59.097 --> 35:01.300
And I am not
gonna hurt him!
Well, I'm not either!

35:01.333 --> 35:03.168
(roaring)

35:06.704 --> 35:08.739
Aha!
I knew it!

35:08.773 --> 35:12.311
You two performing
more spells.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.914
I could be out pillaging,
devouring babies,

35:15.947 --> 35:18.284
making merry
with the local virgins!

35:18.317 --> 35:21.786
But instead, I had to come
all the way back here

35:21.820 --> 35:24.155
to kill you!
Anya, run!

35:24.190 --> 35:26.625
(Anya, Willow screaming)

35:32.731 --> 35:34.065
No! Get away
from them!

35:35.867 --> 35:38.336
(chuckles)
I will get away from them,

35:38.369 --> 35:41.706
-after I kill them.
-You are not touching
these women.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.010
(grunts)

35:45.043 --> 35:46.478
(growls)

35:54.353 --> 35:55.721
(laughs)

35:58.757 --> 36:01.927
Ah, you wish for more?
Admirable! Ha.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.831
(chuckling)

36:12.438 --> 36:13.838
(laughing)

36:23.514 --> 36:25.182
(laughing)

36:25.217 --> 36:28.320
(laughs)
You fight well,

36:28.353 --> 36:31.856
although you are
a tiny man.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.592
(grunting)

36:34.626 --> 36:37.094
I shall reward you.

36:37.128 --> 36:40.231
Only one of your women
shall die,

36:40.266 --> 36:43.068
and you shall be
the one to choose.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.844
-Did he just say--
-(chuckles)
Choose.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.213
Anyanka or the witch--

36:56.248 --> 36:58.384
one of your women must die.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.920
No. You are
one crazy troll.

37:01.952 --> 37:05.291
I'm not choosing
between my girlfriend
and my best friend.

37:05.324 --> 37:09.059
-That's insane troll logic.
-Go, Xander. I love you.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.362
(laughs)
Good for you.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.764
You are a loyal man.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.867
(panting)
(bones cracking)

37:15.900 --> 37:17.536
(screams)
Xander!

37:17.568 --> 37:20.105
Now, choose!

37:20.137 --> 37:22.940
-Olaf, no!
-I'm not choosing.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.378
Then you shall be
the one who dies.

37:26.411 --> 37:29.414
No!
Choose me!

37:29.447 --> 37:32.851
Just don't take him.
Don't take Xander.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.188
(speaking Latin)

37:38.255 --> 37:39.324
Damn.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.594
-ANYA: Buffy!
-WILLOW: Tara, stay back!

37:42.628 --> 37:44.496
(growling)
Buffy, the hammer!

37:44.530 --> 37:45.931
His strength's
in the hammer!

37:51.503 --> 37:53.804
-Uhh!
-(growling)

37:53.838 --> 37:56.007
How can I help?
Uh,

37:56.041 --> 37:58.809
distract him from Buffy.
Uh, piss him off.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.447
I don't know how.
Anya,
I have faith in you.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.280
There is no one
you cannot piss off.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.018
Um, hey, Olaf!

38:08.052 --> 38:10.989
-You're as inadequate a troll
as you were a boyfriend.
-(growls, groans)

38:12.391 --> 38:15.793
Uh, you-you--
you're hairy and unattractive,

38:15.827 --> 38:18.797
and even the women trolls are
put off by your various odors.

38:18.829 --> 38:22.333
(speaking Latin)

38:25.903 --> 38:27.873
(growling)

38:27.905 --> 38:31.677
ANYA: Your menacing stance
is merely mildly alarming!
(cries out)

38:31.710 --> 38:33.644
(bellowing)

38:33.679 --> 38:36.347
And your roar is less
than full-throated!

38:36.382 --> 38:37.583
Desist!

38:39.184 --> 38:42.487
My god, woman,
it's been a thousand years,

38:42.521 --> 38:45.056
and yet you are
as aggravating

38:45.090 --> 38:47.559
and emasculating
as ever you were.

38:47.592 --> 38:48.659
Aaargh!

38:48.693 --> 38:51.929
(speaking Latin)

38:56.768 --> 38:58.202
(Anya grunting)

38:58.235 --> 39:00.539
Hey. Hey, good job.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.039
You too.
Very irritating.
Thanks.

39:02.072 --> 39:05.010
So, your power's
in your hammer.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.414
(growls, grunts)

39:13.385 --> 39:16.454
Oh, yeah! I forgot.
He still has all that
troll strength.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.157
You shall all die!

39:19.190 --> 39:21.927
I will dispense
no mercy now!

39:25.864 --> 39:28.032
(groaning)
(ligaments tearing)

39:28.065 --> 39:30.436
(grunts)

39:32.369 --> 39:35.574
What are you fighting for,
minuscule blonde one?

39:35.606 --> 39:37.775
Your friends, these two?

39:37.809 --> 39:40.077
(laughs)
they will never last.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.514
Anyanka is very difficult
to live with,

39:43.548 --> 39:45.916
and he--
(scoffs)

39:45.951 --> 39:49.054
He's ludicrous
and far too breakable.

39:49.086 --> 39:52.523
(chuckles)
Their love will never last.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.925
(whimpers, sniffles)

40:02.568 --> 40:04.869
She's got him now.

40:04.902 --> 40:08.306
Oh, poor baby.
(groaning)

40:08.338 --> 40:10.742
You really dated him?

40:10.775 --> 40:12.878
(glass shattering)
Yes.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.782
But you like me better.
Yes. Oh, and Willow
likes you too,

40:16.815 --> 40:21.085
but not in a sexy way,
you know, 'cause she's gay.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.420
And she's not
gonna try to break us up,
so, you know, it's all okay.

40:23.454 --> 40:26.056
BUFFY:
Their love... will last...
(blows landing)

40:26.090 --> 40:28.293
forever!
(Olaf groans)

40:30.829 --> 40:33.931
Let the transposition
be complete.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.806
BUFFY:
Where did you send him?

40:40.838 --> 40:44.909
The land of the trolls.
He'll like it there--
full of trolls.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.911
It's hard to be
precise though.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.146
Alternate universes
don't stay put.

40:49.179 --> 40:52.583
Trying to send him
to a specific place
is sort of like-- like...

40:52.617 --> 40:56.487
trying to hit a puppy
by throwing a live bee
at it.

40:56.521 --> 41:00.525
Which is a weird image,
and you should all
just forget it.

41:00.559 --> 41:04.663
ANYA: It's possible
that he's in the land
of perpetual Wednesday,

41:04.695 --> 41:05.996
or the crazy melty land

41:06.030 --> 41:07.599
or, you know,
the world without shrimp.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.333
There's a world
without shrimp?

41:09.367 --> 41:11.469
I'm allergic.

41:11.503 --> 41:14.204
He's probably
in troll land.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.273
I only care that
he's not here,

41:16.306 --> 41:18.543
and I got this
nifty souvenir.

41:22.681 --> 41:26.284
-Oops.
-XANDER: The place
is trashed enough anyway.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.519
Well, see how well
things worked out?

41:30.355 --> 41:31.690
And look at you guys--

41:31.722 --> 41:37.061
so good and alive
and together.

41:37.094 --> 41:41.733
So together and good

41:41.766 --> 41:43.902
and alive.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.371
Oh, god.
(sniffles)

41:46.403 --> 41:49.574
I'm-- I'm just
so happy for you.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.010
(sobbing)

41:54.512 --> 41:56.414
I cringe to think
what the place
would've looked like

41:56.447 --> 41:59.150
If I'd been away
for longer than three days.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.385
Well, maybe we would've
had time to clean it up.

42:01.418 --> 42:03.755
You know,
if Willow used
some magics to help.

42:03.789 --> 42:06.557
Yes, 'cause nothing
could possibly go wrong
with that.

42:06.592 --> 42:09.427
Rupert, I still
don't understand--

42:09.460 --> 42:12.898
oh, thank you--
why the other Watchers

42:12.931 --> 42:14.833
made you go
all the way to England

42:14.865 --> 42:16.802
when they don't know
anything.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.938
Well, they don't
know it yet.

42:19.971 --> 42:24.108
I mean, they have no record
of Glory or anyone like her,

42:24.141 --> 42:26.344
but, uh, based on
the information
that I've given them,

42:26.376 --> 42:28.079
they're going
to look into it.

42:28.112 --> 42:30.916
Um, they might have
something soon.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.818
What about the Key?
Were they all over it?

42:35.753 --> 42:38.422
Yes. You-you know
all of this?

42:38.456 --> 42:41.726
I got some of it myself.
Buffy told me the rest.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.429
Well, they're interested,
certainly,

42:45.463 --> 42:47.898
and, uh, full of theories.

42:47.932 --> 42:50.802
Most of them nonsensical.

42:53.639 --> 42:55.440
BUFFY:
They don't know
that it's Dawn.

42:55.472 --> 42:57.574
GILES:
No.

42:57.608 --> 42:59.978
I still can't even
begin to grasp this.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.648
She's my
little girl.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.181
GILES:
It is disorienting.

43:05.617 --> 43:07.652
BUFFY:
Giles, what happens
if they figure it out?

43:07.686 --> 43:10.789
What would they do?
GILES: I don't know.

43:13.023 --> 43:15.492
Oh, I can't even
think about this.

43:15.525 --> 43:16.494
It's too--

43:17.829 --> 43:19.197
I'll get
some more milk.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.375
Grr! Arrgh!
