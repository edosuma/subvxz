00:22.142 --> 00:24.507
[crickets chirp]

00:24.540 --> 00:26.374
[Isaac] I trust the
money is on its way.

00:27.441 --> 00:28.307
[Olga] Mm.

00:28.341 --> 00:30.841
- [footsteps approaching]
- [door creaks]

00:35.975 --> 00:38.875
[breathes heavily]

00:41.841 --> 00:43.207
[whooshing]

00:43.241 --> 00:44.441
[Isaac] Here it is.

00:46.075 --> 00:48.540
The oldest Jack in the box...

00:49.641 --> 00:50.708
ever discovered.

00:53.341 --> 00:54.341
The original

00:55.408 --> 00:56.573
Jack in the box.

01:00.708 --> 01:03.374
I believe this is the very
one you've been looking for.

01:04.974 --> 01:05.808
Yes.

01:08.608 --> 01:09.507
This is the one.

01:15.808 --> 01:18.142
Finding it wasn't easy.

01:19.908 --> 01:22.875
This box was linked to a
murder case a few years back.

01:24.307 --> 01:27.540
Some nut in Hawthorne drove
its value on the black market

01:27.573 --> 01:31.174
through the roof with
his... ghost stories.

01:32.908 --> 01:36.741
Some sick-minded collectors
would bleed themselves dry

01:36.775 --> 01:39.207
to get their hands
on a thing like this.

01:40.841 --> 01:43.507
Thankfully, none of
them have pockets

01:43.540 --> 01:44.641
quite as deep as yours.

01:52.741 --> 01:54.540
This will be a
wonderful addition

01:54.574 --> 01:56.075
to our vintage
toy collection.

01:58.108 --> 01:59.941
It will take pride of place.

02:07.641 --> 02:12.608
Mr. Huxley, can I ask you
not to smoke that in here?

02:12.641 --> 02:15.108
You can ask all you like,

02:15.142 --> 02:17.207
but I don't take
orders from the help.

02:18.407 --> 02:19.808
[Olga] Do as he says.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.708
Or that briefcase will
get a whole lot lighter.

02:26.574 --> 02:29.341
[Isaac chuckles]

02:37.373 --> 02:38.241
I'm no servant.

02:41.741 --> 02:43.075
You sure fooled me.

02:47.142 --> 02:50.241
[door creaks]

02:50.274 --> 02:53.174
[footsteps recede]

02:54.340 --> 02:56.108
He'll get what he deserves.

03:04.207 --> 03:05.675
I'll put this on display.

03:05.708 --> 03:06.541
Leave it.

03:09.508 --> 03:11.340
I wish to be left alone now.

03:14.675 --> 03:17.075
All right. I'll take
it down in the morning.

03:19.042 --> 03:20.174
Can I get you anything?

03:21.508 --> 03:22.574
- Goodnight.
- [slow string music]

03:24.108 --> 03:24.941
Goodnight.

03:29.241 --> 03:30.440
Sleep well, Mother.

03:30.474 --> 03:31.741
[door creaks]

03:33.975 --> 03:36.373
[Olga sighs]

04:26.373 --> 04:27.608

04:28.641 --> 04:29.474
Keys!

06:54.408 --> 06:58.075
[brooding orchestral music]

07:54.641 --> 07:56.808
[Chauffeur] It's quite
a sight, isn't it?

07:58.741 --> 07:59.941
[Amy] It certainly is.

08:03.841 --> 08:08.841
- [keys clink]
- [distant crow caws]

08:10.008 --> 08:12.608
[box crackles]

08:16.541 --> 08:19.307
It always takes them a lifetime
to open these old gates.

08:20.474 --> 08:22.341
We'd break into
Fort Knox quicker.

08:22.374 --> 08:24.307
[Amy chuckles]

08:24.341 --> 08:25.741
[box crackles]

08:42.640 --> 08:43.541
Here we go.

08:44.908 --> 08:46.307
[Amy chuckles]

08:46.341 --> 08:50.007
[brooding orchestral music]

09:19.307 --> 09:21.808
[birds tweet]

09:25.974 --> 09:27.708
[Amy chuckles]

09:27.741 --> 09:28.574
Welcome, Amy.

09:30.775 --> 09:31.608
Thank you.

09:32.841 --> 09:35.908
You must be Edgar. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.608
This place is incredible.

09:39.908 --> 09:40.841
It certainly is.

09:42.108 --> 09:44.207
I often forget how lucky we are.

09:44.241 --> 09:46.875
This has been home to
Mother and I for 20 years.

09:47.974 --> 09:49.974
I'm not used to luxuries.

09:50.908 --> 09:53.174
She never spares expense.

09:53.207 --> 09:54.441
Is your mother here?

09:54.474 --> 09:56.274
I'd really like to thank
her for the opportunity.

10:02.108 --> 10:03.775
She won't want to be disturbed.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.675
She's been bed bound
for some time now.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.307
[Amy] That's awful.

10:10.474 --> 10:13.541
She has osteosarcoma.
Cancer of the bones.

10:14.974 --> 10:17.374
The agony she feels with
each movement, it's uh...

10:18.574 --> 10:20.075
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

10:21.474 --> 10:25.474
She's been seen by every doctor,
every expert we could find.

10:29.075 --> 10:31.608
She was given roughly
six months to live.

10:31.641 --> 10:32.874
That was five months ago.

10:39.474 --> 10:41.641
But I'll never give up on her.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.474
She's a fighter.

10:49.108 --> 10:51.508
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

10:51.541 --> 10:52.474
Please, come in.

10:58.474 --> 10:59.708
[car starts]

10:59.741 --> 11:01.241
Your duties here
are all focused on

11:01.274 --> 11:03.675
the general upkeep of the manor.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.675
Mainly cleaning and ironing.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.874
I'll brief you every morning

11:06.907 --> 11:08.741
with the tasks
for the day ahead.

11:08.775 --> 11:10.274
Your room is on the first floor.

11:10.307 --> 11:12.940
The floor is shared with your
colleagues, Janet and Frank.

11:12.974 --> 11:15.541
My mother and I
occupy the top floor.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.307
We don't charge for the room,

11:17.341 --> 11:19.641
or even any meals
you're provided with.

11:21.075 --> 11:23.008
You are treated in many
ways as one of the family.

11:24.708 --> 11:28.174
All we ask in return is that
you follow our rules, strictly.

11:32.008 --> 11:32.807
Have a read.

11:34.541 --> 11:38.142
I, uh, I think you'll agree
the role pays quite handsomely.

11:42.574 --> 11:45.075
Quite? [chuckles]

11:49.075 --> 11:50.641
A nine o'clock curfew?

11:51.907 --> 11:53.142
No one comes in or
out of those gates

11:53.174 --> 11:54.508
from nine PM onwards.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.708
I don't fancy your chances
over those 10-foot walls,

11:57.741 --> 12:00.441
so please, make sure you're
on this side of the gates

12:00.474 --> 12:04.108
at sunset and we
won't have a problem.

12:08.374 --> 12:11.042
[paper flicks]

12:11.075 --> 12:16.075
Well?

12:19.874 --> 12:22.441
[Amy chuckles]

12:26.741 --> 12:29.174
[Amy sighs]

12:29.207 --> 12:30.508
Welcome to Rosewood Manor.

12:41.142 --> 12:42.341
Good morning, Mother.

12:42.374 --> 12:45.142
- Oh, my god! [gasps]
- [dramatic music]

12:46.907 --> 12:50.840
- [door slams]
- [breathes sharply]

12:50.874 --> 12:52.908
Mr. Huxley is dead.

12:54.574 --> 12:55.740
How?

12:55.774 --> 12:56.774
Who did this?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.174
This box, Edgar.

13:03.274 --> 13:05.374
It's not what you think it is.

13:06.908 --> 13:10.908
It was built to contain
something not of this world.

13:14.142 --> 13:14.975
A demon.

13:17.541 --> 13:19.008
By opening the box,

13:20.274 --> 13:21.374
I have released it.

13:23.274 --> 13:25.142
And if it gets what it wants,

13:25.174 --> 13:28.541
it has the power to
rid me of my illness.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.374
I will be healthy once again.

13:34.042 --> 13:35.042
What does it want?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.807
Six sacrifices.

13:40.174 --> 13:42.008
And I will live.

13:44.975 --> 13:46.307
[Edgar sighs]

13:46.341 --> 13:49.075
This is insane. This is insane.

13:50.374 --> 13:53.908
I need your help.

13:53.941 --> 13:54.774
Edgar.

13:56.008 --> 13:58.641
None of the staff are
to leave the grounds.

13:58.674 --> 14:03.508
You must keep them here by
whatever means necessary.

14:03.541 --> 14:04.374
To die?

14:05.608 --> 14:08.374
It needs five more victims.

14:10.807 --> 14:12.908
You must bring
more to the manor.

14:14.908 --> 14:16.374
I'm not sure I can do this.

14:18.408 --> 14:20.908
We've done the
impossible before.

14:23.174 --> 14:25.274
You're stronger than you know.

14:29.740 --> 14:31.740
Will you help me, Edgar?

14:42.241 --> 14:43.941
Of course I will.

14:43.975 --> 14:47.307
[dark orchestral music]

14:48.841 --> 14:50.008
You know that.

14:57.142 --> 14:59.975
[whisky splashes]

15:09.274 --> 15:12.174
[breathes sharply]

15:21.941 --> 15:24.775
[breathes deeply]

15:32.908 --> 15:35.174
[Isaac] Is anybody there?

15:37.142 --> 15:40.207
[muffled wind howls]

15:41.075 --> 15:42.875
[suspenseful orchestral music]

15:42.908 --> 15:43.941
You've gotta help me.

15:46.541 --> 15:47.374
Mr. Huxley?

16:16.274 --> 16:18.741
[Isaac] You've gotta
help me outta here!

16:18.775 --> 16:20.875
I'm begging you, have mercy.

16:28.808 --> 16:31.307
[door creaks]

16:52.573 --> 16:56.241
[faint snarls and whispers]

17:12.675 --> 17:15.174
[box rattles]

17:17.540 --> 17:18.641
Open the box, Edgar.

17:23.573 --> 17:24.775
Why should I help you?

17:26.108 --> 17:29.341
[Isaac] Have mercy. I'm
begging you, have mercy.

17:31.075 --> 17:33.008
Let me out, Edgar! Now!

17:34.108 --> 17:38.042
[tense orchestral music]

17:38.075 --> 17:40.473
[Edgar pants]

17:40.507 --> 17:43.908
[box chimes melodically]

17:50.908 --> 17:55.008
["Pop Goes the Weasel"]

17:55.042 --> 17:55.975
Let me out!

18:03.540 --> 18:05.108
It won't open!

18:05.142 --> 18:06.408
[Isaac] Let me out!

18:06.440 --> 18:11.440
- [shrieks]
- [Edgar gasps and pants]

18:19.008 --> 18:24.008
- [muffled wind howls]
- [clock ticks]

18:52.307 --> 18:54.641
[Machine] The person whom
you're trying to reach

18:54.675 --> 18:56.008
is currently unavailable.

18:56.042 --> 18:58.008
Please leave your
message after the...

19:05.341 --> 19:06.808
[sighs] Come on.

19:14.174 --> 19:15.207
- [vase shatters]
- [gasps]

19:18.675 --> 19:21.174
[Janet] That vase was only
worth about a grand.

19:22.407 --> 19:24.608
Don't worry. I'll
tell Edgar I did it.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.142
I've been here way to long
to get kicked out now.

19:27.174 --> 19:28.741
Thanks.

19:28.775 --> 19:32.174
I'm Janet, by the way. I'm
on housekeeping duty, too.

19:32.207 --> 19:34.841
Frank. I'm the chef.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.008
It's great to meet you both.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.975
So, everything all right so far?

19:40.241 --> 19:43.108
Yeah. So far so good.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.941
Where's the house phone?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.641
I just, I can't get
any signal anywhere

19:46.675 --> 19:48.241
and I could do
with making a call.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.941
[Frank chuckles]

19:49.975 --> 19:51.307
What?

19:51.340 --> 19:52.541
Uh...

19:52.574 --> 19:54.841
Yeah, there's no
house phone here.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.775
And honestly, good
luck getting a signal,

19:56.808 --> 19:59.941
'cause I've tried many times.

19:59.975 --> 20:02.708
I just, I need to
call my boyfriend.

20:02.741 --> 20:05.541
Well, my ex.

20:05.574 --> 20:08.641
Is there a computer here?
I could send an email.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.508
Nope.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.574
There's no internet, either?

20:14.608 --> 20:18.108
Welcome to the 1800s,
lovely. [chuckles]

20:20.941 --> 20:22.508
He's out of sight, out of mind.

20:23.808 --> 20:25.373
It's a blessing in disguise.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.174
Trust me. [chuckles]

20:30.207 --> 20:31.042
Check.

20:32.042 --> 20:34.541
[Janet sighs]

20:35.975 --> 20:37.108
Oh, come on.

20:37.142 --> 20:38.941
I've got you cornered.
It's all over.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.541
Can I have a go?

20:47.941 --> 20:48.741
Please do.

20:49.941 --> 20:51.441
I'm not very good
at this chess lark.

20:52.641 --> 20:54.075
Let's see what you
got, city girl.

21:03.075 --> 21:08.075
- [suspenseful music]
- [muffled wind howls]

21:19.508 --> 21:20.975
Oh, you're just gonna
run around the board

21:21.008 --> 21:22.108
all night, aren't you?

21:24.008 --> 21:26.574
I'll be honest, you didn't
strike me as a chess player.

21:26.608 --> 21:27.441
[Amy] Why?

21:28.908 --> 21:31.108
Well, you don't meet many
attractive chess players.

21:32.373 --> 21:35.741
- Thanks.
- [Frank chuckles]

21:35.775 --> 21:37.574
There wasn't much else
to do but play games,

21:37.608 --> 21:38.975
growing up in an orphanage.

21:41.374 --> 21:43.240
When I started
beating the adults,

21:43.273 --> 21:45.174
out-thinking people
twice my age,

21:45.206 --> 21:47.741
it gave me the belief that
I could plan an escape.

21:49.206 --> 21:50.574
You escaped the orphanage?

21:52.108 --> 21:54.042
[Amy] But I came straight
back the next day.

21:54.075 --> 21:55.708
[Janet chuckles]

21:55.741 --> 21:56.541
[Janet] Why?

21:57.741 --> 22:00.075
I just needed to prove
to myself that I could.

22:00.108 --> 22:02.340
From that point on, I
was no longer afraid

22:02.374 --> 22:03.374
of where I'd end up.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.206
I took comfort knowing
that if I ended up

22:08.240 --> 22:10.841
in a bad situation with a
family that mistreated me,

22:13.975 --> 22:15.641
I could find my way
out of anywhere.

22:18.341 --> 22:19.173
Checkmate.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.508
[Janet and Frank chuckle]

22:26.541 --> 22:27.374
Yes!

22:28.808 --> 22:32.008
I think she's gonna fit
in just fine around here.

22:32.042 --> 22:32.841
Don't you?

22:36.042 --> 22:38.775
[crickets chirp]

22:48.775 --> 22:51.741
- Come on!
- Shh, keep your voice down.

22:51.775 --> 22:53.541
[Frank chuckles]

22:53.574 --> 22:56.206
[Janet giggles]

23:03.075 --> 23:05.108
[Frank chuckles]

23:05.141 --> 23:07.307
[switch clicks]

23:07.341 --> 23:09.206
I hate those creaky floorboards.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.508
Are you sure they didn't see us?

23:16.541 --> 23:17.741
Yes. I'm sure.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.008
[creaking]

23:36.808 --> 23:37.641
Shh.

23:49.141 --> 23:52.541
[box chimes melodically]

24:00.341 --> 24:01.875
You're so paranoid.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.274
You look pretty scared, too.

24:05.307 --> 24:08.107
- [scoffs] I don't get scared.
- [Janet chuckles]

24:08.141 --> 24:09.341
- Liar.
- Mm-hm.

24:13.541 --> 24:15.541
[moans]

24:18.808 --> 24:20.875
[Janet breathes heavily]

24:20.908 --> 24:21.741
Frank?

24:22.941 --> 24:24.574
- What?
- I can't do this.

24:25.975 --> 24:27.574
I'm sorry. My mind, it's racing.

24:29.173 --> 24:31.675
[Frank sighs]

24:33.173 --> 24:34.008
Fine.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.274
I'm sorry.

24:37.408 --> 24:40.241
Yeah.

24:40.274 --> 24:42.775
[sighs] Yeah.

24:47.207 --> 24:50.641
["Pops Goes the Weasel"]

24:52.975 --> 24:55.975
[suspenseful music]

[door slams]

25:11.307 --> 25:14.474
[Edgar pants lightly]

25:15.541 --> 25:16.474
Very funny, Janet.

25:20.274 --> 25:21.708
[heavy knocks]

25:21.741 --> 25:22.574
Open the door.

25:24.908 --> 25:26.408
[chuckles]

25:26.441 --> 25:31.041
- [box chimes melodically]
- [eerie orchestral music]

25:32.041 --> 25:33.908
All right, this isn't funny.

25:33.941 --> 25:36.374
- Open the door.
- [lights crackle]

[sighs]

25:54.474 --> 25:55.274
[heavy knocks]

25:55.307 --> 25:56.808
Janet, open the door!

25:58.574 --> 26:00.408
[door thuds]

26:00.441 --> 26:02.741
[grunts]

26:02.775 --> 26:05.940
For Christ's sake, you
know I get claustrophobic!

26:05.974 --> 26:07.041
Open the door!

26:08.174 --> 26:09.241
Janet!

26:09.274 --> 26:11.041
[ominous tones]

[box lid slams]

27:01.041 --> 27:03.608
[box grinds]

27:03.641 --> 27:05.808
[gasps] I can't do this.

27:05.841 --> 27:08.940
[gasps] I can't do this.

27:08.974 --> 27:13.307
[gasps] I can't do
this, I can't...

27:17.075 --> 27:18.741
[whisky splashes]

27:18.775 --> 27:21.708
[breathes heavily]

27:27.907 --> 27:29.241
I can't do this.

27:33.108 --> 27:34.207
I need to talk to you!

27:35.675 --> 27:37.142
Mother! Let me help you.

27:37.174 --> 27:38.007
No.

27:39.708 --> 27:40.641
I can do it.

27:42.408 --> 27:43.207
Cane.

27:51.174 --> 27:52.474
[Edgar] How can this be?

27:53.508 --> 27:55.541
It has killed again, hasn't it?

27:56.641 --> 27:57.840
[Edgar] Frank is dead.

28:00.108 --> 28:04.840
[Olga] Every life the demon
takes increases its strength.

28:05.907 --> 28:07.441
And as it gets stronger-

28:08.675 --> 28:09.541
So do you.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.042
[Olga] I'm another step closer.

28:14.075 --> 28:16.274
[groans]

28:16.307 --> 28:18.307
[pants]

28:20.341 --> 28:21.675
Have patience.

28:28.142 --> 28:30.408
You won't let me
down, will you, Edgar?

28:32.574 --> 28:33.408
Hm?

28:35.741 --> 28:39.574
The demon must continue
to get what it wants.

28:42.775 --> 28:44.042
We're gonna finish this.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.474
Together.

28:49.907 --> 28:52.108
I won't rest until
it kills four more.

28:55.408 --> 29:00.142
Whatever it takes, Mother,
I'm gonna keep you alive.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.408
I promise.

29:08.374 --> 29:12.042

[knocks]

29:33.474 --> 29:35.975
[door closes]

29:42.508 --> 29:46.274
You should've told me
that you were coming.

29:48.608 --> 29:49.908
Do you always wear that?

29:53.474 --> 29:54.274
Wear what?

29:55.641 --> 29:56.840
That perfume.

29:58.042 --> 30:00.108
I bought that for you
for special occasions.

30:02.541 --> 30:04.807
Look, Edgar, I'll see
you tomorrow, okay?

30:05.941 --> 30:08.840
- I need to talk to you.
- [suspenseful music]

30:08.875 --> 30:10.975
I have to tell you something.

30:11.008 --> 30:14.307
It's killing me, keeping
it to myself. Please.

30:28.541 --> 30:29.740
I think you should
look at trying

30:29.774 --> 30:31.274
to get some professional help.

30:33.641 --> 30:35.374
I've never seen you
like this before.

30:37.674 --> 30:40.341
You used to be so happy
and so full of life.

30:45.341 --> 30:46.674
I want that Edgar back.

30:48.508 --> 30:49.307
My Edgar.

30:52.474 --> 30:53.975
Not the one that she makes you.

30:56.508 --> 30:58.042
What do you mean?

30:59.174 --> 31:01.075
Look, I'm not
trying to upset you.

31:01.108 --> 31:02.574
What do you mean?

31:14.574 --> 31:17.075
[sighs] I don't like the
way your mother treats you.

31:18.908 --> 31:23.108
You've spent so much time
caring for her recently,

31:24.875 --> 31:25.841
you change.

31:28.441 --> 31:30.808
The more time you spend
around her, you...

31:32.707 --> 31:35.307
You become someone else.

31:35.341 --> 31:37.508
She gave up everything for me.

31:41.307 --> 31:44.274
If she had told the police
the truth about what I did,

31:47.707 --> 31:49.075
my life would be over,

31:51.042 --> 31:52.241
before it even began.

31:56.307 --> 32:00.474
- I'm forever in her debt.
- [distant siren wails]

do with a nice cup of tea.

36:31.008 --> 36:32.042
Frank's not here.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.975
He left the manor
last night, so,

36:39.941 --> 36:42.108
I will prepare Mother's
breakfast myself.

38:31.408 --> 38:33.075
- That wasn't funny!
- [Janet laughs]

38:33.108 --> 38:36.474
I'm just keeping you on
your toes. [chuckles]

38:39.441 --> 38:41.808
What the hell is that thing?

38:41.841 --> 38:44.808
Some sort of antique
Jack in a box, I guess.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.206
It's a new one.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.941
Olga's always had a taste
for weird collectible stuff.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.042
Not much of a looker,
though, is he?

38:54.408 --> 38:55.675
Look at those eyes!

38:57.408 --> 39:00.173
[laughs]

39:00.206 --> 39:02.374
I'm sorry, okay?

39:02.408 --> 39:05.075
I wouldn't have done it if I
knew it'd bother you this much.

39:08.008 --> 39:11.142
I assume Edgar told
you about Frank?

39:15.908 --> 39:16.741
Yeah.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.408
Yeah, I woke up to a note
outside my door. [chuckles]

39:22.441 --> 39:24.141
He said he was
missing home, so...

39:25.508 --> 39:27.374
Had he talked about
leaving before?

39:33.273 --> 39:34.975
We talked about
leaving every day.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.675
But we were gonna
do it together.

39:40.206 --> 39:41.608
We were gonna start a business

39:41.641 --> 39:45.108
and secretly I hoped
we'd start a family, too.

39:49.374 --> 39:50.474
I just don't get it.

39:51.975 --> 39:53.875
Frank hated going home.

39:57.173 --> 39:59.408
I clearly didn't know
him as well as I thought.

40:02.107 --> 40:04.441
He didn't care about me
as much as I thought.

40:07.574 --> 40:09.173
I'm sorry, Janet.

40:11.508 --> 40:13.975
Like I said. [chuckles]

40:14.008 --> 40:16.240
Out of sight.

40:16.274 --> 40:17.274
Out of mind.

[footsteps approach]

40:39.541 --> 40:42.775
[curtain rings scrape]

40:44.808 --> 40:47.474
You are consumed by
guilt, aren't you?

40:49.274 --> 40:51.908
We are on the cusp
of a miracle, yet,

40:51.941 --> 40:53.808
you feel guilt over them.

40:54.841 --> 40:57.408
A salesman and a cook.

40:57.441 --> 41:01.474
[Edgar] They are people. Flesh
and blood, like you and I.

41:01.508 --> 41:03.241
[Olga] They are nothing like us.

41:06.206 --> 41:08.374
What happens when people
go looking for them?

41:09.541 --> 41:11.741
What happens when
they come here?

41:11.775 --> 41:15.408
When all this is over,
we will start again.

41:17.641 --> 41:21.008
Somewhere so far from here,
no one will ever find us.

41:23.107 --> 41:25.207
We've done it before,
we will do it again.

41:32.574 --> 41:33.941
But that's not all, is it?

41:35.374 --> 41:37.307
- I'm fine.
- Don't lie to me, boy!

41:48.341 --> 41:51.141
It's that girl you've
been seeing, isn't it? Hm?

41:52.708 --> 41:53.508
Stacey.

41:56.374 --> 41:57.941
[Edgar] I don't want
to talk about it.

41:57.975 --> 41:59.441
[Olga] Oh.

41:59.474 --> 42:01.875
Whatever she's done, she's
not good enough for you.

42:01.908 --> 42:04.041
- None of them are.
- That's enough, Mother!

42:08.374 --> 42:09.875
I'm sorry.

42:09.908 --> 42:11.875
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:21.508 --> 42:23.675
This is all just too much.

42:30.808 --> 42:33.207
[Olga sighs]

42:36.741 --> 42:38.541
How did you find
out about the box?

42:41.641 --> 42:43.775
How did you find out
about any of this?

42:46.940 --> 42:48.541
Many years ago,

42:49.775 --> 42:52.408
I discovered the diary
of the box's creator.

42:53.841 --> 42:56.641
He dedicated his life
to the study of demons.

42:57.574 --> 43:00.940
The box was created to contain

43:00.974 --> 43:04.307
the most powerful demon
he ever encountered.

43:05.908 --> 43:07.307
The Jackestemara.

43:08.241 --> 43:09.474
Jackestemara?

43:11.508 --> 43:13.274
"The Demon of Torment".

43:18.041 --> 43:20.108
If the box was
built to contain it,

43:21.907 --> 43:22.974
why can it be opened?

43:24.241 --> 43:26.641
Because it was never
meant to stay locked.

43:29.174 --> 43:31.241
Many have opened it,

43:31.274 --> 43:35.541
but I believe we are
the only ones alive

43:35.574 --> 43:38.408
who know the box's true purpose.

43:40.274 --> 43:41.641
To make a single wish.

43:42.775 --> 43:46.307
A wish granted for
unleashing the demon.

43:50.207 --> 43:52.775
A wish granted by the demon?

43:52.808 --> 43:53.641
[Olga] Yes.

43:55.142 --> 43:59.741
A reward for allowing it
access to our world once again

44:00.775 --> 44:02.541
to find six victims.

44:05.574 --> 44:06.940
You asked for life.

44:11.207 --> 44:13.274
Why does the demon need to kill?

44:14.974 --> 44:17.608
It takes its victim's life.

44:18.508 --> 44:21.574
Their strength, their soul.

44:21.608 --> 44:23.907
Everything is
transferred to the demon.

44:25.307 --> 44:29.608
But most of all, killing
keeps its hold over Didier.

44:31.241 --> 44:32.508
Didier Dubois.

44:33.675 --> 44:35.008
Its human host.

44:37.708 --> 44:40.374
The creature was once human?

44:43.008 --> 44:45.708
Dubois was a clown
in the Victorian era.

44:47.441 --> 44:48.675
For as long as he
could remember,

44:48.708 --> 44:50.840
he was plagued with
voices in his head.

44:51.974 --> 44:54.741
They demanded he
kill his own family.

44:55.907 --> 44:58.142
They grew louder by the day.

45:00.807 --> 45:02.174
You see, the Jackestemara

45:02.207 --> 45:04.641
initially takes
control of the mind.

45:07.675 --> 45:10.775
But it grows inside its
human host like a cancer.

45:13.241 --> 45:16.708
Eventually, taking over
the body completely.

45:20.907 --> 45:24.108
Dubois sought to
exorcize the demon.

45:30.608 --> 45:32.274
But it was too late.

45:33.508 --> 45:37.108
[sinister orchestral music]

45:37.142 --> 45:39.708
It had already taken
too strong of a hold.

46:00.341 --> 46:04.174
Dubois knew he was
running out of time.

46:04.207 --> 46:07.975
The demon would soon use him
to unleash unthinkable cruelty.

46:10.207 --> 46:11.740
To save his family's life

46:11.774 --> 46:15.740
and any others who
crossed his path,

46:15.774 --> 46:19.108
Dubois demanded he
be cast into the box.

46:21.042 --> 46:21.874
Forever.

46:23.241 --> 46:24.408
[eerie tones]

46:24.441 --> 46:27.108
[box lid slams]

46:28.307 --> 46:29.641
Dubois was betrayed?

46:32.374 --> 46:34.574
The creator wanted a child.

46:35.574 --> 46:37.975
A son God wouldn't give him.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.807
Once enough time had
passed for the Jack

46:41.840 --> 46:44.307
to take full
control of Dubois...

46:44.341 --> 46:47.042
[box clicks]

46:47.075 --> 46:48.675

46:58.707 --> 47:01.675

47:03.441 --> 47:06.508

the demon was complete.

47:08.941 --> 47:11.108
The creator was rewarded...

47:13.075 --> 47:13.908
with a son.

going to be easy, Edgar.

47:52.441 --> 47:54.808

You're not as careful
as you think you are.

51:09.507 --> 51:14.507
Even at my lowest, when I
told you my mother was dying,

51:18.174 --> 51:20.008
you couldn't disguise
your happiness.

51:22.207 --> 51:26.207
You were counting
down her final days.

51:27.473 --> 51:32.407
Weren't you?

51:32.440 --> 51:37.440
- Weren't you?

day share everything with.

51:54.941 --> 51:57.908
But in the end, I
want to thank you.

51:59.374 --> 52:00.841
For making me realize

52:03.407 --> 52:05.608
that she is

52:05.641 --> 52:08.241
all I truly need.

52:13.274 --> 52:16.841
And now Mother will
always be there for me.

been a bit unusual.

54:40.708 --> 54:42.508
A bit weird. [chuckles]

54:42.541 --> 54:44.273
Has he ever had a girlfriend?

54:44.306 --> 54:47.340
I've seen him with plenty
women over the years, but,

54:47.373 --> 54:49.142
something's always
got in the way.

54:50.008 --> 54:50.908
Or should I say

54:51.975 --> 54:53.075
"someone".

54:54.508 --> 54:57.941
He gets infatuated, but
then she gets in his ear.

54:59.373 --> 55:01.941
I think Mrs. Marsdale is
scared she'll be replaced.

55:03.608 --> 55:05.975
You should see him with
a drink in him, though.

55:06.875 --> 55:08.408
He really livens up.

55:08.441 --> 55:09.941
Really?

55:09.975 --> 55:12.574
[Janet] He becomes an open book.

55:16.675 --> 55:17.508
No.

55:18.374 --> 55:19.508
No, I can't.

[door closes]

55:40.975 --> 55:43.306
All right. [sighs]

55:43.341 --> 55:45.875
A few years ago, he
got absolutely hammered

55:46.741 --> 55:48.273
and he started talking
to me out of the blue

55:48.306 --> 55:49.841
about his time
back in America.

55:51.474 --> 55:52.675
You could see he
was out of control,

55:52.708 --> 55:54.374
but I just couldn't
stop him talking.

55:55.775 --> 55:59.108
It's like he needed to
tell his story to someone.

56:00.975 --> 56:03.841
Edgar's father also
had a drinking problem,

56:03.875 --> 56:06.075
and was often violent
towards Mrs. Marsdale.

56:08.273 --> 56:10.474
Edgar said one day
he just snapped.

56:10.508 --> 56:11.775
He couldn't stand
back and watch his mom

56:11.808 --> 56:13.173
being beaten up any longer.

56:14.841 --> 56:15.675
So...

56:17.173 --> 56:18.574
Took his father's gin bottle

56:20.775 --> 56:22.240
and smashed it over his head.

56:25.008 --> 56:25.841
He killed him.

56:28.341 --> 56:30.042
He was only 12 years old.

56:31.374 --> 56:34.808
Mrs. Marsdale
framed Edgar's uncle

56:34.841 --> 56:36.273
and the two fled the country.

56:37.775 --> 56:39.875
I've always got the
impression she will never

56:39.908 --> 56:41.708
let him forget what
she did for him.

56:43.474 --> 56:44.908
You can see it in his eyes.

56:44.941 --> 56:48.173
The look of determination
to make her happy.

56:51.675 --> 56:54.875
He would die for that woman.

56:56.741 --> 56:59.206
That's why you should
never be afraid of him.

56:59.240 --> 57:03.775
Because despite what that
worm wants you to believe,

57:03.808 --> 57:05.574
he has no power around here.

that I wouldn't tell a soul.

57:25.374 --> 57:28.908
He literally begged me.

01:04:46.274 --> 01:04:47.142
You saw what?

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.408
I've never seen
anything like it before.

01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:01.441
But whatever it was,
it wasn't human.

01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:05.674
It was...

01:05:05.707 --> 01:05:07.508
It was some sort of creature.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.474
I'm not making this up.

01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:22.341
You don't believe me.

01:05:24.808 --> 01:05:25.808
Well...

01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:27.341
[Amy] Well what?

01:05:27.374 --> 01:05:30.108
It's not logical, Amy.

01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:31.640
But I know what I saw!

01:05:36.042 --> 01:05:40.207
- Are you sure?
- [somber orchestral music]

01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:43.307
I...

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:45.941
Look.

01:05:47.274 --> 01:05:48.274
Take the day off.

01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:51.341
Take the rest of the week off.

01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:53.573
Janet and I will cope.

01:05:54.707 --> 01:05:56.374
I'm sure the rest
will do you some good.

01:05:57.775 --> 01:06:01.573
Now, Dr. Clarke is on
his way. He's a good man.

01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:04.241
He's been a blessing for Mother
and I, these last few years.

01:06:05.674 --> 01:06:08.441
Do as he says and I promise
you, you'll be right as rain.

01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:18.808
In the meantime, if
you need anything,

01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:21.042
anything at all,

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.674
just shout.

01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:38.042
You're in good hands
with us down here, Amy.

01:06:41.241 --> 01:06:42.808
There's no safer place to be.

01:06:46.108 --> 01:06:49.008

01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:14.675
[Clarke] Okay.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.274
Are you taking any medication?

01:07:19.307 --> 01:07:20.142
No.

01:07:21.307 --> 01:07:24.540
Difficult question. No
judgment, of course.

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:26.841
Have you taken anything
you shouldn't have

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:28.341
in the past 24 hours?

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.207
Recreational drugs are
one of the most common

01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.241
causes of hallucinations.

01:07:32.274 --> 01:07:34.241
It wasn't a hallucination.

01:07:39.075 --> 01:07:43.307
[Clarke clears his throat]

01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:45.507
I'm going to give you...

01:07:49.908 --> 01:07:53.241
[dark orchestral music]

01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:58.042
I'm going to suggest
you get plenty of rest.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.440
I'll leave you my card.

01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:04.008
My direct number
is at the bottom.

01:08:05.174 --> 01:08:06.841
Please feel free
to give me a call

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.142
if you have any further
problems or concerns.

01:08:10.341 --> 01:08:12.841
No matter what time or
what the problem is.

[briefcase clicks]

[footsteps recede]

01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.075
You didn't do it, did you?

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:56.774
Why are you doing this?

01:08:58.372 --> 01:08:59.407
This is just wrong.

01:09:00.707 --> 01:09:03.207
- Why are you lying to her?
- Keep it down.

01:09:06.407 --> 01:09:07.975
I'm gonna tell Amy the truth.

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:11.541
[thud]

01:09:11.573 --> 01:09:13.341
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.

01:09:13.372 --> 01:09:14.439
Ruin what?

01:09:17.008 --> 01:09:18.975
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't go up there

01:09:19.008 --> 01:09:20.274
and tell her the truth.

01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:24.774
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:09:26.042 --> 01:09:27.774
[Clarke scoffs]

01:09:27.808 --> 01:09:29.808
You think I'm afraid of you?

01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:33.675
No.

01:09:35.274 --> 01:09:36.075
Not of me.

01:09:37.108 --> 01:09:39.774
[suspenseful orchestral music]

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.241
But you should be afraid.

01:09:42.908 --> 01:09:43.908
Is that right?

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:47.741
Afraid of what?

01:09:49.372 --> 01:09:52.108
[Edgar chuckles]

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:56.207
You have no idea.

01:10:06.808 --> 01:10:09.306
Don't ever contact me again.

[Edgar] I got rid of his car.

01:12:36.441 --> 01:12:38.141
[Olga] He would've told someone.

01:12:41.374 --> 01:12:42.941
Somebody knows he was here.

01:12:44.141 --> 01:12:46.306
We need to finish this
and get away, quickly.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.675
I've locked down the manor.

What's wrong?

01:13:11.675 --> 01:13:13.541
The doctor gave you
meds, didn't he?

01:13:15.008 --> 01:13:15.841
No.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.775
Well, I think he
was going to, but,

01:13:21.808 --> 01:13:23.641
for some reason, he
changed his mind.

01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:26.508
I overheard something earlier

01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:28.274
that I definitely
wasn't supposed to.

01:13:29.775 --> 01:13:32.408
I couldn't catch what they
were saying exactly, but...

01:13:34.741 --> 01:13:36.474
I saw Edgar give
the doctor money.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.206
He gave him a lot of money.

01:13:43.274 --> 01:13:46.641
It looked like he was being
paid to give you something.

01:13:46.675 --> 01:13:47.941
Give me what?

01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:00.173
You think Edgar paid
him to give me pills?

01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:01.775
The doctor seemed against
what they were scheming with

01:14:01.808 --> 01:14:05.241
to begin with, but the cash,
well, that changed everything.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.474
Oh, my god.

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.173

01:14:14.808 --> 01:14:15.641

01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.608
- What is?
- The gate key!

01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:20.074
It's gone!

01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.341
Edgar's taken it!

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.307
Well, why would he
take that from us?

01:14:23.341 --> 01:14:25.408
I told him I wanna go home
and he wouldn't let me,

01:14:25.441 --> 01:14:28.307
so he's got the gate key and
he's locked it, hasn't he?

01:14:28.341 --> 01:14:29.741
[keys clink]

01:14:29.775 --> 01:14:32.107

I'm gonna find that key and
I am getting out of here.
