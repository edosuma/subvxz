00:01.086 --> 00:03.359
Denny, somehow I've grown
rather fond of Shirley.

00:03.359 --> 00:05.908
Well, you can't have her.
A man doesn't eat where his friend…

00:05.908 --> 00:07.211
–Schmidts?
–Exactly.

00:07.211 --> 00:10.620
The fact is, many HMO's
are outsourcing major surgery.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.812
When a person is told
she needs heart surgery,

00:12.812 --> 00:15.196
she does not expect to be
shipped to India to have it.

00:15.196 --> 00:17.532
Judge Marcia Hooper
was found murdered last night.

00:17.532 --> 00:18.646
We were having an affair.

00:18.646 --> 00:20.733
–What's going on?
–The police just arrested Scott Little.

00:20.733 --> 00:22.947
<i>–Maybe I should do it.
–You mean, kill judge Hooper?</i>

00:22.947 --> 00:24.175
He's talking to a therapist.

00:24.175 --> 00:26.786
You gave the tape to the police
the afternoon of her death?

00:26.786 --> 00:28.964
Well, I gave it to her husband.

00:28.964 --> 00:30.211
What?

00:37.914 --> 00:41.062
No, no, no, no, we're not
gonna be making any statements.

00:41.062 --> 00:42.792
It hurts me way more
than it hurts you.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.461
You know how much I love to talk.

00:44.461 --> 00:48.533
Let's just say we're very happy that
Scott Little is out of that jail cell,

00:48.533 --> 00:50.675
a place he shouldn't
have been to begin with.

00:51.169 --> 00:55.256
<i>The fact that they would let
an accused killer out at all</i>

00:55.256 --> 00:59.544
<i>goes to show what a joke our
criminal justice system has become,</i>

00:59.544 --> 01:04.890
<i>where the haves get one form of justice
and the have-nots get none at all.</i>

01:05.039 --> 01:07.381
Denny, you have got
to gag this woman.

01:07.381 --> 01:10.302
–I would love to.
–Evidently, she plans to attend the trial.

01:10.302 --> 01:11.649
Gracie Jane's coming to Boston?

01:11.649 --> 01:13.649
Well, she lost John Mark Karr.

01:13.759 --> 01:15.482
I am a nervous wreck.

01:15.482 --> 01:17.756
It doesn't matter
how many trials I do.

01:17.756 --> 01:20.069
Every one is like the first one.

01:20.069 --> 01:20.963
Who's he?

01:20.963 --> 01:23.572
Paul Lewiston, Bethany Horowitz.
We're in trial together.

01:23.572 --> 01:26.214
It all comes down
to opening arguments, you know?

01:26.214 --> 01:29.732
80% of all trials, the jury makes up
its mind after the opening.

01:29.732 --> 01:31.992
You shouldn't smoke.
It'll stunt you.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.785
Um, never mind.

01:34.205 --> 01:36.894
What, you've never seen
a smoking dwarf before?

01:36.894 --> 01:38.652
Bethany, are you okay to do this?

01:38.652 --> 01:40.057
Of course I'm okay.

01:40.057 --> 01:41.740
I just get opening-day jitters.

01:41.740 --> 01:43.840
You know what I do
when I get anxious?

01:43.840 --> 01:46.857
–No, and I don't want to know.
–It works.

01:47.197 --> 01:52.717
You are a sicko, perverted,
lewd, disgusting sleaze.

01:52.717 --> 01:54.763
It's sexual, this ear pinch.

01:54.763 --> 01:57.600
Yes. Pinching the ear
gives you blood flow.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.017
When's the last time you got that
without taking a pill?

02:03.205 --> 02:07.205

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2006/10/10

02:33.551 --> 02:33.737
(edited by ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ)

02:33.737 --> 02:35.484
–Two out of three.
–What?

02:35.484 --> 02:38.717
One of us has to cozy up to Dr Simon.
He's a serial flirt.

02:38.717 --> 02:41.249
Jeffrey thinks we can
infiltrate his discretion.

02:41.249 --> 02:42.344
I'll take odds.
Okay, ready?

02:42.344 --> 02:44.713
–Oh, please.
–Come on.

02:44.923 --> 02:47.400
One, two, three, shoot.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.269
Yes! Again.

02:49.269 --> 02:52.366
One, two, three, shoot.

02:52.646 --> 02:53.832
Yes!

02:53.832 --> 02:56.921
–Great.
–He bellies up to the bar at McCabe's at 6.

02:56.921 --> 02:58.455
Wear some perfume.

02:58.455 --> 02:59.786
What's going on?

02:59.786 --> 03:03.578
Paul, judge Hooper, the victim's husband,
I hear you know him.

03:03.578 --> 03:04.383
I do.

03:04.383 --> 03:07.825
He's basically the only one who can
give us any details on his wife's life.

03:07.825 --> 03:10.020
Jeffrey's been shot down.
Could you try?

03:10.020 --> 03:13.083
Unless you'd rather flirt with Dr Simon.

03:23.558 --> 03:27.005
Judge Brown just assigned me a cannibal.
You're second chairing.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.176
Did you say “cannibal”?

03:28.176 --> 03:30.039
I figured if any lawyer could relate—

03:30.039 --> 03:33.081
I didn't know Massachusetts
had cannibals.

03:33.081 --> 03:34.568
It's “don't ask, don't tell”.

03:34.568 --> 03:36.378
We're meeting the client at 11.

03:36.378 --> 03:37.856
Thanks for volunteering.

03:37.856 --> 03:40.379
Wait, no. Why me?

03:40.379 --> 03:42.343
Because this case is disgusting.

03:42.343 --> 03:44.018
It's distasteful.
It's repugnant.

03:44.018 --> 03:46.263
–Everything I stand for.
–I'll drive.

03:46.263 --> 03:50.215
Shirley, is this about getting
in a room with me?

03:50.215 --> 03:51.281
Yes, Alan.

03:51.281 --> 03:55.124
I went out and recruited a cannibal
just to get close to you.

03:55.124 --> 04:00.373
The idea of two consenting adults
savouring one another's meat—

04:00.373 --> 04:03.387
11 o'clock.
I'll bring the condiments.

04:15.436 --> 04:18.776
Look at that picture there closely.
What do you see?

04:18.776 --> 04:21.531
–A dead woman.
–No, no, that one there.

04:21.531 --> 04:24.350
–Still dead.
–On the nightstand.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.708
–Flowers.
–Flowers.

04:28.708 --> 04:32.501
Flowers wrapped in tissue
and under that, newspaper.

04:32.501 --> 04:34.033
They're not even in water yet.

04:34.033 --> 04:37.513
Somebody just brought her these flowers.

04:37.513 --> 04:39.384
Who would bring her flowers, Jeffrey?

04:39.384 --> 04:40.974
Not her husband.
He doesn't even seem to like her.

04:40.974 --> 04:42.545
And I don't think Scott would,

04:42.545 --> 04:45.159
since people having illicit affairs
don't tend to leave behind clues.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.667
And newspaper?
What kind of florist uses newspaper?

04:47.667 --> 04:52.823
No, these flowers are from
someone's private garden.

04:52.823 --> 04:55.468
–Lincoln Meyer.
–I think he was there that night.

04:55.468 --> 05:00.046
Maybe after he saw the boy leave,
he went in.

05:09.414 --> 05:10.726
Is she okay?

05:10.726 --> 05:12.017
She's panting like a dog.

05:12.017 --> 05:13.439
I heard that.

05:13.439 --> 05:16.103
–Are you okay to do this?
–This is how I get, all right?

05:16.103 --> 05:19.260
Maybe I'm especially nervous here,
because I need to make them settle.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.825
I know I can't prove malpractice.

05:21.825 --> 05:24.066
Not to worry.
–We all get nervous, Bethany.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.610
I do not want to hear what you do.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.878
What I do before I open

05:28.878 --> 05:31.023
is I remind myself who I am,
how I got here.

05:31.023 --> 05:32.914
There's a reason
I'm sitting in the courtroom.

05:32.914 --> 05:35.605
So before I get up,
I say to myself,

05:35.605 --> 05:37.318
“I'm Denny Crane.”

05:37.318 --> 05:38.679
And that's what you've got to do.

05:38.679 --> 05:39.981
So before you get up,

05:39.981 --> 05:42.073
take a deep breath
and you say to yourself,

05:42.073 --> 05:44.612
“I am a midget.”

05:45.285 --> 05:47.560
All rise.

05:52.942 --> 05:55.305
His name was Joseph Greenberg.

05:55.305 --> 05:57.667
He was my best friend,

05:57.667 --> 05:59.366
my only friend.

05:59.366 --> 06:00.604
And you ate him.

06:00.604 --> 06:02.149
I'm not a cannibal.

06:02.149 --> 06:04.317
I'm not what they're
making me out to be.

06:04.317 --> 06:08.045
They have a witness who saw you,

06:08.045 --> 06:10.498
“chewing on a thigh.”

06:10.498 --> 06:12.027
I was cremating him.

06:12.027 --> 06:16.882
We had made a pact that
if one died and the other didn't…

06:16.882 --> 06:20.885
And while he was burning,

06:21.674 --> 06:23.667
I happened to be starving.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.634
I hadn't had a meal in weeks.

06:25.634 --> 06:28.839
It's just that he was there,
and I tried it.

06:28.839 --> 06:30.241
I tried it.

06:30.241 --> 06:33.645
I was weak with hunger.
I was delirious. I…

06:33.645 --> 06:36.127
I don't know.
I was curious.

06:36.127 --> 06:39.457
And I took a bite.
It was stupid.

06:39.457 --> 06:41.952
May I ask?

06:41.952 --> 06:43.877
This was your friend.

06:43.877 --> 06:47.150
Uh, when he died, why didn't
you notify the authorities?

06:47.150 --> 06:50.032
To be cremated,
you need a next of kin.

06:50.032 --> 06:52.425
The medical examiner
won't take responsibility

06:52.425 --> 06:55.003
for burning a homeless person
without permission.

06:55.003 --> 06:57.350
So people out on the streets,
buddies of ours,

06:57.350 --> 07:01.468
end up rotting on a slab
in a warehouse downtown.

07:01.468 --> 07:04.432
Joe deserved better than that.

07:04.432 --> 07:08.012
You face a number of serious charges.

07:08.535 --> 07:12.827
Violating the health code,
desecration of a human body.

07:12.827 --> 07:15.608
Am I gonna go to jail?

07:17.071 --> 07:19.864
Let us talk to the district attorney.

07:19.864 --> 07:21.973
I'm sorry.
I want to help you.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.343
I really do,

07:23.343 --> 07:25.818
but there'll be no plea,
no discussion of one,

07:25.818 --> 07:28.090
and frankly, no leniency
when it comes to sentencing.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.894
This is you wanting to help us?

07:29.894 --> 07:32.509
–Shirley… can I call you “Shirley”?
–No.

07:32.509 --> 07:35.799
If this were just about one
homeless man desecrating another…

07:35.799 --> 07:37.042
We wouldn't care.

07:37.042 --> 07:41.375
But this is about the sanctity
and morality of a society,

07:41.375 --> 07:42.663
the human race, in fact.

07:42.663 --> 07:46.112
Oh, God, you're not gonna drag
the human race into this, are you?

07:46.112 --> 07:49.182
–Mr Shore—
–Actually, I prefer to be called “Shirley.”

07:49.182 --> 07:50.633
It gives me a tickle.

07:50.633 --> 07:53.706
Knowing you, you probably plan
to get up in the end

07:53.706 --> 07:57.235
and deliver some stirring closing
like, “cannibalism is good.”

07:57.235 --> 07:59.402
“The world needs more people
devouring each other.”

07:59.402 --> 08:01.030
No, we already have enough of that.

08:01.030 --> 08:05.250
My problem is the American people
have been so desensitized to atrocity,

08:05.250 --> 08:09.641
we just turn an indifferent ear and eye
to the most heinous of conduct.

08:09.641 --> 08:12.088
Well, I am not going to turn away.

08:12.088 --> 08:15.652
I'm going to make
a firm and public stand.

08:15.652 --> 08:17.929
Almost sounds as if
you're running for something.

08:17.929 --> 08:19.561
Oh, gee, you are.

08:19.561 --> 08:22.757
Tell me, why saddle up on this issue?
Was pædophilia taken?

08:22.757 --> 08:24.370
No deal.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.853
He goes to jail.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.744
And tell your boy,
between now and trial,

08:28.744 --> 08:31.768
he'd better not eat anyone else.

08:31.768 --> 08:35.061
Tell me, Mr Vote-for-me-come-November,

08:35.061 --> 08:39.754
what if you lose this trial?
Did that ever occur to you?

08:40.216 --> 08:42.111
Funny, it didn't.

08:42.111 --> 08:44.248
Perhaps it should.

08:46.612 --> 08:50.635
I would love to see how
you're gonna win this one.

08:50.883 --> 08:53.027
Shirley.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.277
All right, we'll first hear
from the plaintiff's attorney.

09:07.277 --> 09:10.653
Ms Horowitz.
–Thank you, your honor.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.379
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury—

09:20.379 --> 09:21.932
I beg your pardon.

09:21.932 --> 09:24.038
May I have a word
with counsel, please?

09:24.038 --> 09:25.917
–What?
–I apologize, your honor.

09:25.917 --> 09:28.461
It's just, we may be
able to resolve this.

09:28.461 --> 09:31.906
If I could just speak with her
for a minute…

09:31.906 --> 09:34.905
Take two if it'll resolve it.

09:39.019 --> 09:42.252
$400,000.
Final offer.

09:42.252 --> 09:43.849
Good for 30 seconds.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.064
What do you mean,
“good for 30 seconds”?

09:45.064 --> 09:46.735
Better confer with your client.

09:46.735 --> 09:49.458
Clock is ticking.

09:51.268 --> 09:53.765
–He just offered $400,000.
–Just like that?

09:53.765 --> 09:55.754
–But it's only good for 30 seconds.
–What? What do you mean?

09:55.754 --> 09:58.135
I mean, he put a clock on it.
Half a minute.

09:58.135 --> 09:59.558
$400,000 is a lot of money.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.837
Are you kidding?
Take it!

10:00.837 --> 10:03.234
–This would be my advice.
–We can get more.

10:03.234 --> 10:04.457
You don't even know the case.

10:04.457 --> 10:06.322
I can always get more.

10:06.322 --> 10:08.469
Just say yes!

10:12.492 --> 10:14.860
–We accept your offer.
–Oh, jeez.

10:14.860 --> 10:19.592
The offer was only good for 30 seconds,
and you took 33.

10:19.592 --> 10:22.076
Offer rescinded.

10:22.262 --> 10:25.379
Guess you'll have to
resume your opening.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.037
He baited me deliberately.

10:34.037 --> 10:35.901
He did this because the book on you is

10:35.901 --> 10:37.460
you're less effective
when you lose your cool.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.267
Oh, shut up!

10:38.267 --> 10:40.498
This is exactly the state
of mind that he wants you in.

10:40.498 --> 10:42.179
It was an offer made in bad faith.

10:42.179 --> 10:43.678
I should bring a motion for sanctions.

10:43.678 --> 10:44.957
That wouldn't make any difference.

10:44.957 --> 10:46.707
–Shut up!
–Shut up yourself!

10:46.707 --> 10:48.551
Now listen to me.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.036
You're the badger.

10:51.036 --> 10:53.456
Now you can either let this guy win
by rattling you with a cheap stunt,

10:53.456 --> 10:56.534
or you could march yourself
into that courtroom

10:56.534 --> 10:59.522
and deliver the opening of your life.

10:59.722 --> 11:01.673
It's in your hands, Bethany.

11:01.673 --> 11:04.057
Are you a winner or not?

11:10.469 --> 11:12.654
Hello, Brian.

11:12.832 --> 11:14.566
What are you doing in my chambers?

11:14.566 --> 11:16.931
First, let me extend
my condoleances—

11:16.931 --> 11:19.660
Please leave my chambers, Paul.

11:23.452 --> 11:25.526
We have a very difficult job to do,

11:25.526 --> 11:28.366
which you can certainly understand,
if not appreciate.

11:28.366 --> 11:31.892
You're profiteering
off my wife's death.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.452
If you came in here looking
for my sympathy—

11:34.452 --> 11:36.272
Only your cooperation.

11:36.272 --> 11:39.283
You won't get it.
I'll ask you again to leave.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.312
–My friend—
–I'm certainly not your friend.

11:41.312 --> 11:45.812
As part of our defense, we will be trying
to focus suspicion on other suspects.

11:45.812 --> 11:49.735
–I asked you—
–I think you need to hear me out.

11:55.004 --> 11:56.788
We know from our investigation so far

11:56.788 --> 12:00.434
that both you and your wife were
being treated by Dr Zachary Simon.

12:00.434 --> 12:03.178
We also have reason to believe

12:03.178 --> 12:10.647
that your late wife was engaged
in extramarital relations with other men.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.789
I can explore this with you now

12:13.789 --> 12:17.429
or in a much more public forum
during your testimony.

12:17.429 --> 12:20.335
–You're threatening me?
–I am informing you

12:20.335 --> 12:23.795
that we will do whatever
we have to to protect our client.

12:23.795 --> 12:26.172
On the chance that
somebody else killed her,

12:26.172 --> 12:30.295
you must be willing to at least—
–Your client killed my wife.

12:30.295 --> 12:34.228
There's no evidence of
anyone else even being there.

12:34.391 --> 12:36.817
Except you.

12:39.168 --> 12:42.516
Is that where you're going
with your defense, Paul?

12:42.516 --> 12:46.971
We will go down any path
that leads to reasonable doubt,

12:46.971 --> 12:50.608
and yes, my friend.

12:50.608 --> 12:53.683
That is a threat.

12:56.614 --> 12:58.876
I came around the back of the building,

12:58.876 --> 13:00.517
and that's when I saw it.

13:00.517 --> 13:01.729
What did you see?

13:01.729 --> 13:03.715
First, I saw a flame.

13:03.715 --> 13:06.814
And as I got closer,
I saw him.

13:06.814 --> 13:08.333
–The defendant?
–Yes.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.846
And what else did you see?

13:09.846 --> 13:14.192
He was eating something,
meat off a bone on the fire.

13:14.192 --> 13:19.330
And what I saw next,
well, I couldn't believe my eyes.

13:19.330 --> 13:19.966
What?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.470
Not to interrupt, but might this be
a good time to take a break?

13:22.470 --> 13:23.635
Sit down!

13:23.635 --> 13:25.207
Tell us what you saw, miss Baker.

13:25.207 --> 13:26.865
For those of us who don't watch the news

13:26.865 --> 13:29.251
or the district attorney's
self-serving press conferences.

13:29.251 --> 13:32.433
Mr Shore, I will hold you in contempt!

13:32.433 --> 13:35.136
–Oh, now I'm the bad guy?
–Sit, sit, sit!

13:35.136 --> 13:39.121
Miss Baker, tell the jury
what you saw next.

13:39.121 --> 13:44.278
A dead human body
cooking over an open fire,

13:44.278 --> 13:48.449
and that man was eating
part of the leg.

13:48.449 --> 13:51.006
–Are you sure?
–Yes, I'm sure.

13:51.006 --> 13:57.130
It was the most disgusting, awful,
horrible, grotesque thing I ever saw!

13:57.130 --> 13:58.351
–She left out—
–Shocking!

13:58.351 --> 13:59.907
There we go.

14:07.512 --> 14:10.416
<i>Here's what doesn't make sense to me.</i>

14:10.451 --> 14:13.855
<i>There was no evidence
of his fingerprints.</i>

14:13.855 --> 14:16.701
<i>Nada, zip, zilch, nothing.</i>

14:16.701 --> 14:22.427
<i>How could that be
if he was there delivering documents,
making love to the victim,</i>

14:22.427 --> 14:23.858
<i>doing who knows what?</i>

14:23.858 --> 14:27.187
<i>The only explanation can be?
He wiped the prints away.</i>

14:27.187 --> 14:28.594
<i>Why would he do that
if he wasn't guilty?</i>

14:28.594 --> 14:32.172
–Hi. Um, a vodka neat, please.
<i>They ought to gut him like a fish.</i>

14:32.172 --> 14:34.321
<i>I have said it before.
I will say it again.</i>

14:34.321 --> 14:38.459
<i>He is guilty, guilty, guilty.
Until then…</i>

14:38.459 --> 14:41.415
The media just can't
get enough, can they?

14:41.415 --> 14:43.370
Oh, yeah.

14:45.731 --> 14:47.951
I think he did it.

14:47.951 --> 14:52.131
I mean, who else if not him?

14:52.324 --> 14:56.061
Well, I can't really comment.

14:56.293 --> 14:58.309
Why not?

14:58.918 --> 15:01.678
I'm connected with the case.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.265
You are?

15:06.228 --> 15:10.306
The accused was one of my patients.

15:14.098 --> 15:17.315
You're his doctor?

15:19.404 --> 15:23.145
The victim was a former patient.

15:23.145 --> 15:24.934
Oh, you're lying.

15:24.934 --> 15:27.467
I am not lying.

15:27.467 --> 15:31.166
I'm connected with this, big-time.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.173
Wow.

15:37.899 --> 15:41.263
I hope you're not expecting me
to close on this.

15:41.263 --> 15:44.137
Well, of course I am, Alan.
That's your niche.

15:44.137 --> 15:47.502
Making the most unacceptable
of taboos sound…

15:47.502 --> 15:49.507
Exotic?

15:49.507 --> 15:54.175
I cannot stop thinking about
our little session last week.

15:54.175 --> 15:55.712
We didn't have a session.

15:55.712 --> 15:57.019
Admit it, Shirley.

15:57.019 --> 16:00.081
You're drawn to me
like Eve to the serpent.

16:00.081 --> 16:03.584
Take me home and help me
stretch my coil.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.402
Has that line actually worked?

16:05.402 --> 16:06.906
It's working now.

16:06.906 --> 16:11.582
I'm not trying to convince you
of something you don't already want.

16:13.717 --> 16:16.874
I often find that men who like to
talk about it usually disappoint.

16:16.874 --> 16:18.395
All I ask for is a chance.

16:18.395 --> 16:22.118
I'm down on my knees
if you'd like that.

16:23.503 --> 16:27.630
The problem is,
men don't get over me.

16:27.630 --> 16:30.395
–Really?
–Not to sound immodest,

16:30.395 --> 16:32.296
but I'm very good in bed.

16:32.296 --> 16:35.728
In fact, I'm rather phenomenal.

16:36.058 --> 16:39.423
And then there's
the biggest obstacle of all.

16:39.423 --> 16:40.767
Which is?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.297
–Denny.
–Denny who?

16:43.297 --> 16:46.714
He's your best friend, Alan.
It would hurt him.

16:47.362 --> 16:51.514
Suppose I got this...
Denny's blessing.

16:52.131 --> 16:55.198
Get his blessing.
Then we'll talk.

17:02.150 --> 17:05.190
Well, he didn't exactly flow
with information,

17:05.190 --> 17:08.397
but the reason he discontinued
seeing Marcia Hooper

17:08.397 --> 17:11.729
was because there was trouble
in domestic paradise,

17:11.729 --> 17:16.118
and he felt he couldn't ethically
represent both husband and wife.

17:16.118 --> 17:20.289
And he thought Marcia Hooper
was infatuated with him.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.287
What?

17:21.287 --> 17:24.272
Yeah, he said it's very common
with therapists and patients.

17:24.272 --> 17:26.172
It's called transference.

17:26.172 --> 17:28.536
He also asked me out.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.251
<i>Sometimes a district attorney
must safeguard not just the law,</i>

17:32.251 --> 17:34.578
<i>but human decency itself.</i>

17:34.578 --> 17:38.701
<i>This was a crime against
morality, against God.</i>

17:38.701 --> 17:41.677
<i>What has happened to our community?</i>

17:41.677 --> 17:43.281
–Denny, I…
<i>Our society?</i>

17:43.281 --> 17:44.743
<i>When it becomes okay</i>

17:44.743 --> 17:47.162
Why do you have
clothespins on your ears?

17:47.162 --> 17:49.612
Mm, personal.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.901
Denny…

17:54.234 --> 18:02.069
I lay awake in bed last night
taking measure of our special friendship.

18:02.069 --> 18:03.780
Do you ever do that?

18:03.780 --> 18:05.575
–We're flamingoes.
–Yes!

18:05.575 --> 18:10.660
And what I discovered to be
the root, one of the roots,

18:10.660 --> 18:16.336
of our interlocking bond
is our unfettered ability to share,

18:16.336 --> 18:22.787
be it our intimacies,
our fears, our successes.

18:22.787 --> 18:24.084
My root is your root.

18:24.084 --> 18:25.959
If I should ever like
to drive your car…

18:25.959 --> 18:27.053
I'd toss you my keys.

18:27.053 --> 18:29.267
–If I should ever need any money…
–My check is blank.

18:29.267 --> 18:31.447
–Or need to pick your brain…
–My mind is blank.

18:31.447 --> 18:36.890
Anything you have or once
did have is there for me.

18:36.890 --> 18:39.064
Except for Shirley.

18:39.306 --> 18:43.188
Keep your root away from Shirley.

18:43.367 --> 18:46.105
–She told you.
–Told me what?

18:46.808 --> 18:48.371
My friend…

18:48.371 --> 18:53.352
One of my goals in life is to go to
all the places you've gone, and…

18:53.352 --> 18:55.007
Just don't go to Shirley.

18:55.007 --> 18:57.086
She's mine.

18:57.824 --> 18:59.653
–Denny—
–No.

19:06.324 --> 19:11.017
Okay, Ms Horowitz, let's
give this another go, shall we?

19:21.127 --> 19:24.311
My client's wife needed heart surgery.

19:24.311 --> 19:30.488
And so her HMO stuck her on a plane
and sent her to India to have it,

19:30.488 --> 19:32.701
where she died on the table.

19:32.701 --> 19:35.922
The reason she was sent to India
is because it's cheaper.

19:35.922 --> 19:37.809
It's called medical outsourcing.

19:37.809 --> 19:40.599
It goes on all the time,
and I'm sure you know this.

19:40.599 --> 19:41.823
And you know what?

19:41.823 --> 19:45.247
If I needed surgery,
I might consider making the schlep.

19:45.247 --> 19:48.761
Why should I pay $90,000
for heart surgery

19:48.761 --> 19:52.060
when I can get the same thing
over there for $10,000.

19:52.060 --> 19:56.266
The problem is that Cindy Potter
didn't get to make that choice,

19:56.266 --> 19:58.925
because when she signed on
with Wellness health care,

19:58.925 --> 20:01.264
all of the surgeries were done here.

20:01.264 --> 20:04.791
When that policy was modified,
she couldn't switch HMO's,

20:04.791 --> 20:08.562
because by then, she had
a preexisting heart condition,

20:08.562 --> 20:10.867
and nobody else would take her,

20:10.867 --> 20:13.222
at least not at a price
that she could afford,

20:13.222 --> 20:15.866
so she had to get on that plane.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.186
My client here, he had to work.

20:18.186 --> 20:19.488
He couldn't go with her,

20:19.488 --> 20:23.407
and his wife died
on the other side of the world.

20:23.407 --> 20:28.261
Now I can't really put
a price tag on that, can you?

20:28.261 --> 20:31.934
Now I know it's not
the defendant's fault

20:31.934 --> 20:34.553
that medical expenses
are out of control here.

20:34.553 --> 20:38.274
I don't blame the defendant
that half of Americans are uninsured.

20:38.274 --> 20:43.614
In fact, I give them credit
for searching for a solution.

20:43.614 --> 20:45.050
But come on.

20:45.050 --> 20:50.846
Shipping a patient with a heart
condition to India is not a solution.

20:50.846 --> 20:53.732
It can't be.
We have to be better than that.

20:53.732 --> 20:55.544
This is America.

20:55.544 --> 21:00.115
They should be banging down
congress' doors.

21:01.118 --> 21:06.525
They find it cheaper to go to India.

21:18.718 --> 21:21.272
And they said they might
be calling me early.

21:21.272 --> 21:24.144
I could be the lead-off witness.
Can you imagine?

21:24.144 --> 21:25.306
You're gonna be on television.

21:25.306 --> 21:27.436
I'll be on “Gracie Jane.”

21:27.436 --> 21:29.590
These are some beautiful
flowers, Lincoln.

21:29.590 --> 21:32.278
I grew them myself.
I'm very botanical.

21:32.278 --> 21:33.655
Oh, I can see that.

21:33.655 --> 21:34.937
Hey, Lincoln,

21:34.937 --> 21:37.321
I was reading Mrs Hooper's affidavit

21:37.321 --> 21:39.722
in support of her motion
for a restraining order.

21:39.722 --> 21:44.511
It didn't seem to me like she
was infatuated with you at all.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.949
Her husband put her up to that.
He's evil.

21:46.949 --> 21:49.645
She said some terrible things about you,

21:49.645 --> 21:53.072
called you “psychologically
disturbed, sick.”

21:53.072 --> 21:54.490
That had to hurt.

21:54.490 --> 21:55.675
Bet it made you angry even.

21:55.675 --> 21:57.548
I don't like the tenor
of your remark.

21:57.548 --> 22:00.102
No, I'm just saying here's
this woman that you adored.

22:00.102 --> 22:02.060
Bet you loved to bring her flowers, huh?

22:02.060 --> 22:04.496
And in a public document,
she calls you “sick,”

22:04.496 --> 22:06.245
“mentally unbalanced.”

22:06.245 --> 22:08.981
I recognize your tenor, Mr Coho.

22:08.981 --> 22:10.739
I'm not stupid.

22:10.739 --> 22:13.762
You mean to imply
that I killed her.

22:13.762 --> 22:15.216
I loved her.

22:15.216 --> 22:17.605
I cherished her.

22:17.825 --> 22:20.615
You are not welcome
in my home anymore,

22:20.615 --> 22:24.156
you and your inappropriate tenor.

22:24.469 --> 22:27.181
I'll ask you to leave.

22:33.962 --> 22:37.463
The bad news is we were unable
to find any character witnesses.

22:37.463 --> 22:43.148
It seems your only friend was Joseph.

22:43.148 --> 22:44.401
Is there any good news?

22:44.401 --> 22:45.996
“Primetime” wants to have you on.

22:45.996 --> 22:49.762
During Sweeps they want you
to eat Diane Sawyer.

22:52.742 --> 22:55.429
Sorry.

22:55.618 --> 22:57.662
Why do you need a character witness?

22:57.662 --> 23:02.566
Well, the jury could be
looking at you like…

23:03.524 --> 23:07.857
You need to demonstrate to them
that you are not a monster.

23:07.857 --> 23:10.476
Maybe I am a monster.

23:11.551 --> 23:13.692
I burned my best friend.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.786
I ate him.

23:15.786 --> 23:17.570
Maybe I'm every bit of…

23:17.570 --> 23:20.581
You're not a monster, Mr Nichols.

23:22.442 --> 23:27.731
What kind of person ends up
by himself on the street?

23:30.071 --> 23:34.579
I don't have one single friend
that can speak on my behalf.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.781
You're not a monster,

23:36.781 --> 23:39.478
and you're not a criminal.

23:40.250 --> 23:44.366
All we can do is
to call you to the stand.

23:44.366 --> 23:50.785
You need to explain to the jury,
as sympathetically as you can,

23:50.785 --> 23:53.970
why you did what you did.

24:04.638 --> 24:08.935
It's not fair.
You can't just claim women for all time.

24:08.935 --> 24:10.786
I only claim Shirley.

24:10.786 --> 24:12.945
–What about Ivan Tiggs?
–She married him.

24:12.945 --> 24:14.963
Why don't you take the girl
I married last year?

24:14.963 --> 24:17.829
You can have her.
–I want Shirley.

24:17.829 --> 24:19.102
I can understand how you feel.

24:19.102 --> 24:24.159
When I was 15, I had
this enormous crush on a girl.

24:24.159 --> 24:26.030
Diana Coralac.

24:26.030 --> 24:28.820
She was a fetching goddess.
She developed early.

24:28.820 --> 24:31.500
But she liked this kid George.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.903
So one day I went to George
and I said, uh,

24:34.903 --> 24:38.013
“I'll wrestle you for her,”
and why he agreed I don't know,

24:38.013 --> 24:40.100
but within four seconds
I flipped him on his back,

24:40.100 --> 24:42.059
sat on his head and he tapped out.

24:42.059 --> 24:46.072
And then I spent the night
in Diana's fetching bosom.

24:46.072 --> 24:47.979
It was magic.

24:47.979 --> 24:49.594
I challenge you, Denny.

24:49.594 --> 24:50.925
To what?

24:50.925 --> 24:52.441
You're going to wrestle?

24:52.441 --> 24:54.113
Why not?
It's not like he can beat me.

24:54.113 --> 24:56.025
And you think I'm the prize?

24:56.025 --> 24:57.610
You're always the prize, Shirley.

24:57.610 --> 25:00.368
Of all the humilia—
how dare you?

25:00.368 --> 25:03.047
Making me the prize
in a wrestling match?

25:03.047 --> 25:04.458
Oh, get over yourself.

25:04.458 --> 25:07.936
Man has done battle to get the girl
since the beginning of time.

25:07.936 --> 25:09.687
Man has evolved, Alan,

25:09.687 --> 25:12.086
with the exception,
of course, being Denny.

25:12.086 --> 25:13.042
Thank you.

25:13.042 --> 25:14.356
Shirley, admit it.

25:14.356 --> 25:16.394
This has to be a little thrilling.

25:16.394 --> 25:19.488
Thrilling? Two fat boys
fighting it out on a mat?

25:19.488 --> 25:22.018
You know the problem
with mankind, Shirley?

25:22.018 --> 25:23.225
Oh, God.

25:23.225 --> 25:25.114
We legislate our morality,

25:25.114 --> 25:30.505
our beings with this code of reason and
common sense and respectable restraint.

25:30.505 --> 25:33.527
And it leaves no room for passion,
for bestial yearning.

25:33.527 --> 25:38.203
It leaves Jack a very dull boy
and Jill thoroughly unsatisfied.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.542
How rich this moment is
if you think of it.

25:41.542 --> 25:45.467
Two men in their sexual—

25:45.689 --> 25:51.129
Okay, twilight, are about to enter a cage
for the right to nestle into your loins,

25:51.129 --> 25:52.927
to uncork your holy grail.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.224
This is life, Shirley!
We're ready to kill for you.

25:55.224 --> 25:58.891
This is the very essence of life.

26:01.386 --> 26:04.472
What he said, totally.

26:10.416 --> 26:12.663
How's the case going?

26:12.873 --> 26:14.092
Could be better.

26:14.092 --> 26:17.127
If you ask me, plea murder two.
Good behavior, kid's out in six.

26:17.127 --> 26:18.939
I don't think Jeffrey's
gonna want to plead.

26:18.939 --> 26:21.866
Of course not.
Give up his 15 minutes?

26:21.866 --> 26:24.583
Brad, he's coming in
with another offer.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.111
–Who?
–The disgusting slimeball defense lawyer.

26:27.111 --> 26:31.498
This time I think it's for real.
He asked to continue the trial.

26:31.827 --> 26:33.872
This woman is a starer.
Where's Denny?

26:33.872 --> 26:35.933
In his office.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.408
I don't like starers.

26:40.828 --> 26:43.147
I wasn't staring.

26:43.847 --> 26:47.366
I was only trying to cremate him
according to his wishes.

26:47.366 --> 26:48.868
As a homeless person,

26:48.868 --> 26:54.526
he would have ended up decomposing
on a slab alone somewhere till…

26:54.994 --> 26:56.338
I couldn't allow for that.

26:56.338 --> 27:00.800
Okay, but at some point
during the cremation ceremony,

27:00.800 --> 27:03.684
you decided to eat your friend.

27:03.684 --> 27:05.443
We had both read the book,

27:05.443 --> 27:09.635
the account of the soccer team that was
on the plane that crashed in the Andes.

27:09.635 --> 27:12.151
The survivors had to eat
some of the dead bodies

27:12.151 --> 27:15.057
so that they could continue to survive.

27:15.057 --> 27:17.846
None of them were arrested,
by the way, if you read the book.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.309
You and Joseph talked about this?

27:19.309 --> 27:23.780
Yes, not, not that, that's
what I planned to do that night at all.

27:23.780 --> 27:28.674
I'm just saying that what I did do
was not contrary to his wishes.

27:28.674 --> 27:32.896
I think the jury would like
to know, why did you do it?

27:34.325 --> 27:36.901
I was starving.

27:36.901 --> 27:41.199
I hadn't had a meal
in two weeks…

27:43.121 --> 27:46.236
I was starving.

27:54.508 --> 27:57.137
First, let me preface.
This is not a negotiation.

27:57.137 --> 27:58.701
This is a final offer.

27:58.701 --> 28:00.901
Either you accept it,
or we return to court.

28:00.901 --> 28:01.854
What's the number?

28:01.854 --> 28:05.482
$650,000 absent any showing
of malpractice.

28:05.482 --> 28:06.942
That's a gift.

28:06.942 --> 28:09.386
We're just looking to avoid
the expense of a trial.

28:09.386 --> 28:12.648
Yes or no?
What's it gonna be?

28:14.884 --> 28:18.194
The thing about HMO's is
they're very good at math.

28:18.194 --> 28:20.457
The expense of a trial
wouldn't come close to $650,000.

28:20.457 --> 28:22.315
The other thing is
they don't make gifts.

28:22.315 --> 28:24.979
It's the exposure of a trial that you're
worried about, and why shouldn't you be?

28:24.979 --> 28:27.386
The future of your whole
business depends on outsourcing.

28:27.386 --> 28:29.510
It saves you billions
and billions of dollars.

28:29.510 --> 28:31.540
And the worst thing
that could possibly happen is

28:31.540 --> 28:34.376
for some stigma to be
attached to the concept.

28:34.376 --> 28:37.044
I told you,
this is not a negotiation.

28:37.044 --> 28:41.207
The number's $950,000.
Are we going back to court or not?

28:47.667 --> 28:50.845
I think we can make $950,000 work.

28:50.845 --> 28:52.395
Good for you.

28:56.031 --> 28:58.633
The dwarf fainted.

29:20.186 --> 29:22.573
I am so embarrassed.

29:22.573 --> 29:24.666
I have to admit, in my practice,

29:24.666 --> 29:27.340
I have never
seen a number that big.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.558
I'm sure you people
see it all the time.

29:29.558 --> 29:31.484
You caused that number, Bethany.

29:31.484 --> 29:33.718
You scared the hell out of them
with your opening.

29:33.718 --> 29:36.108
They didn't dare stick around
for the closing.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.839
I'm trying not to get emotional.

29:39.048 --> 29:40.292
Thank you, Denny.

29:40.292 --> 29:41.834
I'm so grateful to you.

29:41.834 --> 29:46.971
Somehow in that vile,
disgusting shell of yours,

29:46.971 --> 29:50.321
I think there must be a nice person.

29:52.982 --> 29:54.718
I'd like to have lunch again,

29:54.718 --> 29:56.525
start from scratch.

29:56.525 --> 29:58.678
If I promised
not to call you a midget

29:58.678 --> 29:59.949
and ask you to take
your clothes off—

29:59.949 --> 30:02.264
This is you from scratch?

30:04.488 --> 30:07.470
You're an extraordinary woman.

30:08.048 --> 30:11.285
I don't get to meet many.

30:12.741 --> 30:16.825
Give me a week or two
to forget what you're like.

30:17.068 --> 30:19.700
Then we can have lunch.

30:25.343 --> 30:28.672
We live in a time where almost
anything goes, don't we?

30:28.672 --> 30:31.913
Gay marriage is barely
considered alternative anymore.

30:31.913 --> 30:36.212
You go on the internet, you can find a club
for almost any kind of fetish,

30:36.212 --> 30:38.110
however depraved.

30:38.110 --> 30:41.533
We're a society where nothing
seems to shock us anymore.

30:41.533 --> 30:43.547
Well, if we've reached the day

30:43.547 --> 30:48.634
where burning the remains of a body
and cannibalism doesn't offend,

30:48.634 --> 30:51.038
then I guess life has
no sanctity at all, does it?

30:51.038 --> 30:52.177
No dignity.

30:52.177 --> 30:54.041
Please deliver a verdict

30:54.041 --> 30:59.008
that says there is sanctity
not just to the life of a human being,

30:59.008 --> 31:02.318
but also the death.

31:02.608 --> 31:08.166
A billion and a half Christians
routinely go to church on Sundays

31:08.166 --> 31:11.924
and ceremoniously eat the body
of Christ, drink His blood.

31:11.924 --> 31:13.299
“He who eats my flesh”

31:13.299 --> 31:16.844
“and drinks my blood
abides in me and I in Him.”

31:16.844 --> 31:19.525
Jesus said that.
–How dare you?

31:19.525 --> 31:20.607
What?

31:20.607 --> 31:21.919
Who have I offended now?

31:21.919 --> 31:24.522
How dare you take
the holy sacrament literally?

31:24.522 --> 31:25.631
Is that not done?

31:25.631 --> 31:30.519
You have equated it
with a vile and despicable act.

31:33.327 --> 31:35.572
I apologize, your honor.

31:35.572 --> 31:39.039
I certainly don't mean
to indict holy communion,

31:39.039 --> 31:43.903
but let's not carry on with the idea

31:43.903 --> 31:49.755
that the notion of cannibalism
offends the sanctity of life.

31:49.755 --> 31:54.505
It has roots not only in sacraments
not to be taken literally,

31:54.505 --> 31:56.405
but also Greek mythology.

31:56.405 --> 32:01.518
It's still glorified in certain sections
of both the south and I believe Malibu.

32:01.518 --> 32:03.655
And I might add,
it's not illegal.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.672
There's no federal law,
no Massachusetts law

32:06.672 --> 32:08.553
that criminalizes cannibalism.

32:08.553 --> 32:12.950
That's why Mr District attorney
my-name-appears-second-on-the-ballot–
this-November Ginsberg

32:12.950 --> 32:14.819
has trumped up these other charges,

32:14.819 --> 32:19.980
desecration and so forth and
lectured you on dignity and sanctity.

32:19.980 --> 32:23.559
There is no dignity
in starving to death.

32:23.559 --> 32:27.252
When a homeless person
is left to rot on a slab,

32:27.252 --> 32:31.375
the sanctity of life
somehow gets trivialized.

32:31.375 --> 32:34.770
Mr District attorney my-name-appears-second–
on-the-ballot-this-November Ginsberg

32:34.770 --> 32:37.141
wants you to be offended.
You know what offends me?

32:37.141 --> 32:42.585
We have in this country
over a million homeless people.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.823
The government can't feed them,
can't give them shelter,

32:44.823 --> 32:47.695
but hey, let's spend
$60,000 to $70,000

32:47.695 --> 32:50.035
to prosecute one
who tried to stave off death,

32:50.035 --> 32:52.700
let's spend another $45,000
a year to imprison him.

32:52.700 --> 32:56.092
There is no dignity in that.
It's cruel.

32:56.092 --> 32:58.216
Mr Nichols was cremating his friend

32:58.216 --> 33:01.360
to prevent the indignity
of the unceremonious

33:01.360 --> 33:05.524
and degrading decomposition of his body.

33:06.069 --> 33:10.468
As for why he ate,
he told you.

33:10.468 --> 33:13.290
He was starving.

33:14.738 --> 33:17.373
When was the last time you starved?

33:17.373 --> 33:19.144
How about you?

33:19.144 --> 33:21.149
I know you're not starving,
except for attention.

33:21.149 --> 33:24.061
Let's face it.
They only reason we're all here

33:24.061 --> 33:26.224
is because cannibalism
makes for good television.

33:26.224 --> 33:29.068
What better to satiate some
pre-election hunger pangs

33:29.068 --> 33:31.049
than a bellyful of media attention?

33:31.049 --> 33:34.374
Mr District attorney my-name-appears-second–
on-the-ballot-this-November Ginsberg knows that.

33:34.374 --> 33:36.464
That's why he's handling
this case personally.

33:36.464 --> 33:40.394
Not only does it give him a sensational
platform for his shameless self-promotion,

33:40.394 --> 33:43.005
it also fits his notion of society,

33:43.005 --> 33:45.849
that it's not about
understanding a homeless,

33:45.849 --> 33:48.650
it's about prosecuting him.

33:49.643 --> 33:51.474
Kinda makes you wonder,

33:51.474 --> 33:56.537
who here is really the cannibal?

34:10.129 --> 34:12.147
I'd be more than happy
to drive you home.

34:12.147 --> 34:15.174
Oh, thank you.
I actually have my own car.

34:15.174 --> 34:18.783
Um, which is actually right there.

34:19.213 --> 34:22.205
Is that you don't
trust yourself with me?

34:22.205 --> 34:27.068
Oh, wow, you really can
read people, can't you?

34:27.068 --> 34:29.505
That's my job.

34:30.255 --> 34:32.295
So can I see you again?

34:32.295 --> 34:34.295
Sure.

34:34.656 --> 34:39.360
Let's have something
to look forward to.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.317
I'm a magnificent kisser.

34:41.317 --> 34:42.706
Are you now?

34:42.706 --> 34:45.121
I don't like to drop names but…

34:45.121 --> 34:47.585
I once kissed Gina Gershon.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.694
Did you?

34:48.694 --> 34:51.226
We were out together…

34:51.226 --> 34:52.791
in a group.

34:52.791 --> 34:56.742
I happened to be driving
in the direction of her hotel,
so I offered her a lift.

34:56.742 --> 35:00.110
And well, one thing led to another.

35:00.110 --> 35:06.370
She confided in me that she had
never been kissed like that in her life.

35:06.370 --> 35:09.307
Well… it's, uh…

35:09.307 --> 35:15.044
always been a goal for… my mouth
to… go where Gina's has, but—

35:15.044 --> 35:17.874
I dig you, Claire.

35:18.206 --> 35:21.720
And I dig you, Zach.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.243
Call me.

35:23.243 --> 35:25.063
I will.

35:58.779 --> 36:00.337
Oh, my God.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.536
Why are you dressed like an Indian?

36:39.536 --> 36:42.292
Growing up, my favorite wrestler
was chief Jay Strongbow.

36:42.292 --> 36:44.260
You look like one of
the Village People.

36:44.260 --> 36:45.638
Okay, are we ready?

36:45.638 --> 36:48.486
Shouldn't we pee in a cup first?
I don't trust his testosterone levels.

36:48.486 --> 36:50.200
Mine's naturally high.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.525
3-minute rounds.

36:51.525 --> 36:54.741
2 points for a takedown.
1 point for an escape.

36:54.741 --> 36:57.240
If either of you tap out,
it's over.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.119
Set?

36:58.119 --> 36:59.778
Set.

37:02.130 --> 37:03.824
Let's get it on.

37:26.881 --> 37:28.202
Five seconds?

37:28.202 --> 37:31.119
He cheated.
You can't squat on the head.

37:31.119 --> 37:32.979
Five seconds?

37:32.979 --> 37:35.053
Four, actually.

37:35.277 --> 37:38.088
The defendant will please rise.

37:39.658 --> 37:45.227
Madame foreperson,
would you kindly announce to the court
the outrageous verdict of the jury?

37:45.227 --> 37:46.817
That's encouraging.

37:46.817 --> 37:50.421
In the matter of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts vs Clarence Nichols

37:50.421 --> 37:52.749
on the charge of desecrating human remains

37:52.749 --> 37:56.182
in violation of the human welfare
and safety health code,

37:56.182 --> 37:59.226
we find the defendant
Clarence Nichols

37:59.226 --> 38:01.791
not guilty.

38:01.791 --> 38:03.664
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

38:03.664 --> 38:07.459
Do you think we win too much?
Are we losing all suspense?

38:07.459 --> 38:09.087
I don't know what to say.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.075
–Congratulations.
–Thank you.

38:11.075 --> 38:12.704
Thank you both.

38:12.704 --> 38:17.489
Listen, we never let our contestants
go home empty-handed,

38:17.489 --> 38:20.861
so along with the home version
of the Crane, Poole & Schmidt game,

38:20.861 --> 38:23.757
here's a check for $5,000.

38:23.757 --> 38:24.855
–What?
–What?

38:24.855 --> 38:26.252
It's an experimental program.

38:26.252 --> 38:28.736
It's called “we the fortunate should
endeavor to help the less fortunate.”

38:28.736 --> 38:31.558
I'm sure it'll never fly.
Go have a nice meal, take a trip,

38:31.558 --> 38:35.388
maybe splurge for
some health insurance.

38:35.388 --> 38:37.046
I don't know what to say.

38:37.046 --> 38:39.380
You people are amazing.

38:39.703 --> 38:41.075
Bye.

38:44.992 --> 38:47.915
You gave him your own money?

38:47.915 --> 38:50.521
I wasn't using it.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.134
Denny, I want a rematch.

38:53.134 --> 38:55.114
–Forget it.
–You cheated.

38:55.114 --> 38:57.203
I did not.

38:59.423 --> 39:01.628
You know, the first time
I had sex with Shirley,

39:01.628 --> 39:04.350
it went exactly like that.

39:04.350 --> 39:07.935
I flipped her on her back,
and I sat on her head.

39:09.402 --> 39:11.443
Hope it was better
for her than it was for me.

39:11.443 --> 39:12.479
It was better for me.

39:12.479 --> 39:16.431
It also lasted about four seconds.

39:16.860 --> 39:20.980
Do you think you could ever
bring yourself to eat me?

39:21.187 --> 39:23.642
I mean, say we were on a desert island,

39:23.642 --> 39:27.197
and I died, and you were starving.

39:27.724 --> 39:30.291
Could you eat me?

39:32.433 --> 39:35.204
Could you eat me?

39:35.427 --> 39:39.582
Well, I might be afraid
of the mad cow.

39:39.582 --> 39:42.789
When I die,
I want to be buried, Denny.

39:42.789 --> 39:46.466
I don't want to be cremated,
incinerated into nothingness.

39:46.466 --> 39:49.181
Oh, what do you care?
When you're dead, you're dead.

39:49.181 --> 39:50.767
I don't actually believe that.

39:50.767 --> 39:55.223
I believe there's… something after.

39:55.773 --> 39:57.098
Heaven?

39:57.098 --> 40:00.347
I don't know, something.

40:01.264 --> 40:05.180
Alan Shore believes man has a soul.
Stop the presses.

40:05.180 --> 40:07.275
Don't you believe it?

40:07.275 --> 40:09.141
Can this be all there is?

40:09.141 --> 40:10.870
If so, have we wasted—

40:10.870 --> 40:15.149
I haven't wasted a second.
I've enjoyed my ride.

40:15.524 --> 40:16.950
All of it.

40:16.950 --> 40:20.824
But will it truly have
counted for something?

40:22.887 --> 40:25.365
You know the old joke, Alan?

40:25.365 --> 40:28.179
A man shows up at the Pearly Gates,

40:28.179 --> 40:33.943
sees this guy in a pinstriped suit
and a briefcase, a cigar prancing about.

40:33.943 --> 40:37.636
And he says to saint Peter,
“who's that guy?”

40:37.636 --> 40:40.614
Saint Peter says,
“Aw, it's just God.”

40:40.614 --> 40:43.479
“He thinks he's Denny Crane.”

40:46.407 --> 40:50.996
What would you do, Denny,
if you actually met God one day?

40:51.188 --> 40:54.893
–I'd probably take him fishing.
–Indeed.

40:54.893 --> 40:57.956
He'd probably want
to wrestle me for Shirley.

41:00.517 --> 41:02.110
Indeed again.
