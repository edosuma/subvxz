WEBVTT

00:42.477 --> 00:45.175
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.942
- Amen.
-  Amen.

01:20.645 --> 01:23.822
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.437
I could always
visit you in Edinburgh.

02:13.568 --> 02:17.093
But I love our sexy
<i>Notting Hill</i> weekends.
Don't you?

02:17.224 --> 02:20.401
Of course.
I love the movie.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.620
I love that you
love the movie.

02:22.751 --> 02:25.319
- I love our time together.
- You silly thing.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.452
You'll miss your plane.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.369
My friends say you've got
another woman back home

02:32.500 --> 02:33.805
and three kids named Jock.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.678
That is not true!

02:36.808 --> 02:38.549
It's five kids,

02:38.680 --> 02:41.813
and only two of them
are named Jock.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.860
Who cares what your friends
say, anyway?

02:44.990 --> 02:47.602
Well, I do. They're
the closest thing I have
to family--

02:47.732 --> 02:50.387
I get it, I get it.
I met them, remember?

02:50.518 --> 02:52.172
Ah, yes.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.870
I... I admit they were
a little off the charts

02:55.000 --> 02:57.481
and possibly
off their meds.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.093
Are you sure you want us
to move in together?

03:01.224 --> 03:03.444
Of course I do. I...

03:03.574 --> 03:06.621
I just need a few months
to get things sorted out.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.536
A few months?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.625
You know, it only took them
six weeks to film
<i>Notting Hill.</i>

03:10.755 --> 03:12.627
- It's not that long.

03:12.757 --> 03:15.543
I know. I just...
I hate goodbyes

03:15.673 --> 03:17.458
and it just seems
like my life

03:17.588 --> 03:19.634
is permanently on hold
with customer services.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.553
We'll fix that
as soon as I return,
my darling.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.165
I'll come see you off.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.994
No, no, no, no.
You stay where you are.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.604
You know I hate goodbyes.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.392
I love you.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.441
Claire Chambers.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.487
I love you.

03:51.883 --> 03:52.841
Is that your phone?

03:53.624 --> 03:55.670
Oh, no.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.019
Richard!

04:09.031 --> 04:10.119
- Ugh.

04:21.783 --> 04:22.827
Eww!

04:23.828 --> 04:25.090
Agh!

04:39.627 --> 04:41.150
Claire, I'm in the middle
of a lesson.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.934
It's happened again.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.327
What?

04:44.458 --> 04:47.896
I need wisdom,
and wine, and chocolate.

04:48.897 --> 04:52.204
And tell Theo.
I need Theo.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.476
Hello, gorgeous.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.738
It's Claire.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.915
What's the guy
done this time?

05:07.045 --> 05:08.699
We're on the break-up
duty again.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.179
Been summoned
to the depression den.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.616
Oh, it'll be
that ghastly Scotsman

05:12.747 --> 05:15.184
with his funny combover
and Windsor knots.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.708
I knew this would happen.
I never trusted him.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.406
He's got snake eyes.
I said to her,

05:19.536 --> 05:20.581
"He's got snake eyes."

05:20.711 --> 05:22.060
Theo!

05:22.191 --> 05:23.366
Oh, calm down, bitch!
I'm already on my way.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.542
And I know,
bring chocolate.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.592
- Um, how do you
not remember Richard?
- I...

05:32.593 --> 05:35.378
Clara, in my defense,

05:35.509 --> 05:36.988
there've been very, very, very

05:37.119 --> 05:38.903
- many, many, many, many,
many men.
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.034 --> 05:43.212
Not that many.
Just like five.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.040
- This year.
- Okay, whatever.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.172
I'm nearly 40.
I'm bound to have a history.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.783
- Is that him?

05:48.913 --> 05:49.958
Is that the pig?

05:50.088 --> 05:52.308
Oh, it'll be
my friend Caroline.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.093
Her wedding venue burned down.
She's hysterical.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.270
At least she has a fiancé.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.230
Well, this is clearly
all my fault.
What did I do wrong?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.840
Oh, darling,
be like me.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.407
Take a vow of celibacy.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.669
Now...

06:05.800 --> 06:07.062
Ooh.

06:09.673 --> 06:10.587
There.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.285
Thanks.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.679
Oh, my God.

06:15.810 --> 06:16.985
If that is your friend
with her wedding--

06:17.115 --> 06:19.770
- Oh, it's Ben.
- Oooh! Ben!

06:19.901 --> 06:22.033
<i>Claire!
How are you, darling?</i>

06:22.164 --> 06:25.080
-  Hey, Ben!
<i>- You're all there.</i>

06:25.210 --> 06:27.212
We're all here.
We're on a, you know,
mercy mission.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.562
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

06:28.692 --> 06:30.259
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm calling you

06:30.390 --> 06:32.914
'cause I got a little news
that I need to share with you.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.655
Arnie Sandoval died.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.049
Oh, my God!
Arnie Sandoval died?!

06:38.180 --> 06:41.183
Arnie... hmm.
Who is Arnie Sandoval?

06:41.313 --> 06:45.579
Apparently, he's
my biological father.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.581
- What?!
- What?!

06:47.711 --> 06:50.061
Ben, you don't have
a father.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.237
I mean-- I mean,
who was he?

06:52.368 --> 06:55.937
He's from Saint Kitts and Nevis.
It's a-- it's a--

06:56.067 --> 06:58.766
<i>an island in the Caribbean,
the West Indies.</i>

06:58.896 --> 07:00.550
And apparently,
I'm his only heir

07:00.681 --> 07:02.900
and I inherited his estate.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.033
Wait, I'm sorry.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.644
Ben, how do you feel
about all this?

07:07.775 --> 07:10.473
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around this whole thing.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.736
I'm-- I'm a bit confused.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.783
<i>And I need you guys.
I really do. I...</i>

07:15.913 --> 07:17.437
I want you to come with me

07:17.567 --> 07:20.396
because I need to go down there
and sign some papers and--

07:20.527 --> 07:23.704
and, um, I don't think
I can do this thing alone.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.054
<i>So, my dear friends,</i>

07:26.184 --> 07:29.274
I'm asking you to go
on a little adventure with me.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.495
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

07:32.626 --> 07:36.456
<i>I'll see you next week, guys.
I love you all. Thank you.</i>

07:36.586 --> 07:37.892
- Oh...
- Bye.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.595
- Oh, my God! What?!

07:55.257 --> 07:56.824
Ben Katzman.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.306
You lucky bastard.

08:01.437 --> 08:04.571
Baby, what's up?

08:04.701 --> 08:06.398
Nothing, darling.
Go back to sleep.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.097
Mm. Who called so early?

08:09.227 --> 08:10.359
It was Ben.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.971
He just inherited
some property
in the Caribbean.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.191
Mm-hmm.

08:16.321 --> 08:19.629
He wants to know
if we'd like to go
for a week's vacation there.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.024
Well, who wouldn't?

08:23.154 --> 08:24.982
He's paying for everything.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.898
What? What?
Are you serious?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.596
- Oh, my God.
- Seriously.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.947
- Seriously.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.688
He's inviting Alex.

08:35.863 --> 08:36.820
Are you okay with that?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.387
Of course
I'm okay with that.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.782
Why wouldn't I be?
You married me.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.614
- Does that mean--
- Yes!

08:47.744 --> 08:49.180
Yes, baby. We're going.

09:02.803 --> 09:05.022
Baby, you look amazing.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.809
She's gotta stop
taking selfies.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.421
There they are!
Well, hey!

09:12.552 --> 09:14.075
Claire! Theo!

09:18.514 --> 09:20.298
Oh, my God!

09:30.874 --> 09:33.050
-  Oh, my God!
- Thank you so much
for being here.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.749
You look so beautiful.
Thank you all,
you all look beautiful.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.620
I have an announcement
to make.

09:37.751 --> 09:40.057
Claire is no longer
in the market for love,

09:40.188 --> 09:41.319
and Alex is just here
for sex.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.538
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.105
And by the way,
the driver looks good.

09:44.235 --> 09:47.543
Hello, sir!
Hello!

09:47.674 --> 09:49.197
Oh, Theo, you old queen!
Come here.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.416
Oh, oh. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.896
Don't stop it!
Don't stop it!

09:53.027 --> 09:55.986
Megan, your husband
just assaulted me.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.380
Oh, no. I'm sure
he was just kidding.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.903
Ba-baby, tell him
you're just kidding.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.079
Baby, it's a joke.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.864
Come on, guys! Let's get
on the boat. Here we go.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.343
- Yes!
- Let's go!

10:05.474 --> 10:06.388
Oh, my God!

10:40.944 --> 10:43.077
<i>Welcome to Nevis.
Charlie Brooks,
your father's lawyer.</i>

10:43.207 --> 10:44.513
We spoke on the phone.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.515
Yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.169
Hello, Charlie.

11:28.339 --> 11:31.342
Oh, Ben.
It's beautiful.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.134
I love it.

11:40.264 --> 11:44.225
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful, babe.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.357
All the pretty trees!

11:55.366 --> 11:56.890
Ben Katzman.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.022
You're a lucky bastard.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.242
If I were you,
I'd stay here forever.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.244
Look who's here.
They're here.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.636
-  Hello.
- Hi.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.029
- Welcome, Mr. Katzman.
- Hi. Hi.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.075
I'm Sheldon,
your father's butler,

12:08.205 --> 12:10.033
and this is
my wife, Lois.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.079
- Hello. It's such a pleasure
to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.776
- This place is--
- Magical.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.560
Magical. Yes, it is.

12:15.691 --> 12:18.476
Mr. Katzman, my wife and I
are deeply sorry
for your loss.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.740
I'm so, so sorry to interrupt,

12:20.870 --> 12:22.829
but I really have
to use the bathroom.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.482
- I'll take you.
- Okay. Thank you.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.354
And please, I'm sorry,
but I'm dying for a shower.

12:26.484 --> 12:27.703
It's way too hot for me.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.705
Yeah, I'll take you
to your room.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.751
- Are you Claire?
- Yes. I am.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.535
Nice to meet you.
And are you Theo?

12:33.665 --> 12:34.797
- I am.
- Yes.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.539
You are staying
at the beach club. Okay?

12:37.669 --> 12:39.280
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.195
- All right. Come on,
ladies. This way.
- Okay. Okay.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.587
- Bye, baby.
- Bye-bye.

12:42.718 --> 12:43.850
Come on. Come on.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.874
Hm.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.966
And you must be Ben.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.841
I'm Ashley.
I manage the beach club.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.669
I guess you met
my mum and dad.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.411
I'm Claire.
Ashley, did you say?

13:23.541 --> 13:24.891
Yes.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.068
Say something.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.417
I'm Ben.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.839
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.406
It's really hot.
I'm gonna go take a shower

16:12.536 --> 16:14.321
and get changed.
You gonna come?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.062
No, I'm gonna stay here
for a while.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.238
Okay. Mwah.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.894
How's the club doing?
Has it changed?

16:23.025 --> 16:26.898
No. Well, it's dingier.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.292
We're only open
twice a week now,
post-COVID.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.773
You know, George and Alex
were the big pull
back in the day.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.383
When Theo and I were waiters,

16:33.514 --> 16:35.211
we could barely
get across the room.
It was packed.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.560
Yeah.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.736
Well, the world's changed.
We've changed.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.913
Have we?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.176
Mm-hmm.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.138
I'm glad
you're happy, George.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.358
We are... happy.

16:52.359 --> 16:53.447
Well, I mean, she is.

16:54.970 --> 16:58.321
Look, I know she's
a bit of an Energizer bunny,
and I'm not.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.497
Well, I mean...

17:00.628 --> 17:02.021
I used to be relentless
back in the day.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.893
Hey, don't even say it.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.982
Oh, Georgie, please.

17:07.113 --> 17:11.160
I'm just laying here,
biting my tongue
like a good friend.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.771
Look, she's not as bad
as you think she is, okay?

17:13.902 --> 17:15.512
Oh, George. No one
was thinking that.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.993
- You said it. Not me.
-  Alex,

17:18.124 --> 17:20.343
retract the claws
for once. Okay?

17:20.474 --> 17:23.651
Ah, leave her, Theo.
It's gonna come out
at some point.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.654
You love her, George,
and that's all that matters.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.743
- Thank you.
-  I mean, come on, guys.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.962
It can't be easy for her.
Look at us.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.661
We've known each other
for over 15 years.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.055
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen.

17:38.927 --> 17:39.884
We're old.

17:42.626 --> 17:43.801
I need a drink!

17:43.932 --> 17:47.196
- Hm.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.803
This is Chrishi Beach,
and it's all yours now, Ben.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.156
Yeah. I think I...

18:34.287 --> 18:36.115
I'm gonna need a drink.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.681
Pick your poison.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.684
So where are we staying?

18:40.815 --> 18:42.730
Oh, the beach house.
It's just over there.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.949
- Theo!
- Bye!

18:45.080 --> 18:46.212
Bye.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.477
Oh-ho. Oof.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.393
Robyn makes
the best cocktails
on the island.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.309
Robyn, meet Ben.
He's the new owner.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.398
And these are his friends,
Megan and George.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.835
Welcome to The Love Shack
Bar, guys.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.054
- What can I get you?
-  Hi.

19:03.185 --> 19:06.928
I would love
a frozen margarita.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.933
George, this is not Cancun.
This is Nevis.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.500
I can do better than that.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.371
Well, fantastic.
Surprise us, please.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.286
Sounds good.
Coming right up.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.984
I'm gonna go dance, baby.
Come with me. Mwah.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.334
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.032
I'm going dancing.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.573
Ugh. Disgusting.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.096
Hate it.
This won't do at all.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.663
Absolutely not.

19:46.794 --> 19:50.189
I'm going back to my cozy
kitchen-bathroom combo.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.082
- Ah!
- Who says you get
the best bedroom, bitch?

21:06.221 --> 21:07.614
Hi.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.572
Oh, my God, Claire!

21:09.703 --> 21:12.923
My bed feels like I'm sleeping
on Burt Reynolds'
chest hair-- lo.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.664
I'm Harry. I...
I work at the club.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.145
I didn't know
you guys arrived.
You need anything?

21:17.276 --> 21:19.539
No, thank you.
We're perfectly okay.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.933
Well, I shall have
to call you Prince Harry,

21:23.064 --> 21:25.588
for you are
a prince among men.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.331
Prince Harry? Okay.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.682
Well, I'll be at the club
if you do need anything.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.381
Well, thank you, my prince.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.648
Woman!
I know that look.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.172
I don't want to slap you,
but I will.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.217
You're thinking
of falling for that tall,

21:46.348 --> 21:49.395
impossibly good-looking man
with the perfect ass,
aren't you?

21:49.525 --> 21:53.877
No, definitely not.
Not interested at all.

21:54.008 --> 21:57.054
Sure, he's handsome, articulate,

21:57.185 --> 22:00.057
age-appropriate,
and apparently
gainfully employed.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.887
But I'm over men.
I'm just here
to focus on me.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.237
Okay, now how many times
have we heard that?

22:07.761 --> 22:08.805
Ah!

22:13.201 --> 22:15.856
I've never liked you!
Got my hair wet.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.563
Oh, and that guy
was shouting at you
because you were wearing fur.

22:27.694 --> 22:28.782
Oh, my God!

22:29.957 --> 22:31.567
Yes! And he was like,

22:31.698 --> 22:34.483
"What poor creature had to die
for you to wear this coat?!"

22:34.614 --> 22:36.267
- And you said?
- "My Aunt Vera."

22:36.398 --> 22:38.357
"May she rest in peace!"

22:38.487 --> 22:40.924
And, Theo, you were under
the table. What were you
doing under there?

22:41.055 --> 22:43.579
- Come on. What were you doing?
-  Oh, no! You're doing
all my questions!

22:43.710 --> 22:45.538
It was me.
Remember the heels?

22:45.668 --> 22:47.844
- Oh, the big ones!
They were gorgeous.
- They were gorgeous!

22:47.975 --> 22:50.847
But they were 7" heels.
I twisted my ankle,
my right ankle.

22:50.978 --> 22:53.981
The osteria was to the left.
I could only turn right, right?

22:54.111 --> 22:56.549
So, I'm under the table.
My leg is like this high.

22:56.679 --> 22:59.726
- Who's there with me
under the table?

22:59.856 --> 23:01.554
- Georgie!
- You lie.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.860
You lie.

23:03.991 --> 23:04.905
What was the owner's name?

23:05.035 --> 23:07.081
Luigi!

23:08.648 --> 23:10.084
God, it was too good.
It was too good.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.216
But seriously,
that poor guy.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.044
- But didn't he try
to throw us out?
- Baby...

23:14.175 --> 23:16.917
Yeah. Because--
would you blame him?
We were too noisy!

23:17.047 --> 23:19.963
Baby? I'm--
I'm gonna have
to step away, okay?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.312
- Okay.
-  Could you blame him?

23:21.443 --> 23:22.966
I mean,
come on.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.664
Yeah, but that's when we
pretended that we got married.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.492
I had too much fun.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.581
And then-- we were
at each other's throats
out at the club.

23:28.711 --> 23:29.843
That was amazing.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.453
How long do you all know
each other for?

23:31.584 --> 23:33.455
- Too long.
- Oh, gosh. Way too long.

23:33.586 --> 23:36.763
This one is the older brother
that I never had.

23:36.893 --> 23:39.287
Oh. I love you too.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.596
Hello.

23:44.553 --> 23:45.641
Charlie?

23:45.772 --> 23:47.991
I thought we were gonna
meet tomorrow.

23:48.122 --> 23:51.430
Yes, but I thought
I'd abandoned you
somewhat earlier.

23:51.560 --> 23:55.390
So, I saw the house lit up.
I said, "Why not?"

23:56.913 --> 24:01.352
Like the good old days.
The parties, the hijinks,
the goings-on.

24:03.529 --> 24:07.141
I just need your signature
and a witness.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.882
Perhaps
your charming friend.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.455
I'd love to.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.415
How to get a witness.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.112
- Hey, to the witness!

24:22.243 --> 24:24.637
- To the gorgeous witness.
-  Witness!

24:26.552 --> 24:29.163
I just love
your cooking. Ooh.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.252
-  Georgie, you...

24:31.382 --> 24:34.995
Mm. That is fabulous.
What is that?

24:35.125 --> 24:36.562
- It's my secret.
- Will you teach me?

24:36.692 --> 24:38.477
I wanna learn
how to cook like you.

24:38.607 --> 24:39.869
Of course I will, honey.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.838
So many nights...

24:53.013 --> 24:57.017
your father and I
would sit here,
drink rum,

24:57.147 --> 25:01.151
and have endless discussions
about life.

25:02.196 --> 25:03.632
The papers.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.898
Now, I have already marked
the signature pages

25:09.029 --> 25:11.640
for you and the witness
to sign.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.612
Very good. Now,
when we spoke on the phone,

25:26.742 --> 25:31.225
you expressed a desire
to perhaps sell the estate?

25:31.355 --> 25:33.009
Of course,
I can assist you with that,

25:33.140 --> 25:34.881
if that's
your intention.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.057
Uh, well,
about that...
I just, uh...

25:38.188 --> 25:40.539
I think I'm gonna need
a couple days to think
about that.

25:40.669 --> 25:44.368
This is huge.
Of course you need
time to think.

25:46.283 --> 25:49.025
Yes, take your time.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.419
Meanwhile, enjoy
our beautiful island.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.117
And if you decide to sell,

25:54.248 --> 25:57.904
there are already several
very interested buyers.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.514
Really?

26:00.994 --> 26:02.778
Could you give us
a moment, please?

26:02.909 --> 26:04.084
Of course.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.566
Thank you.

26:12.309 --> 26:16.575
- How do you feel?
- I feel pretty good,
I guess.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.188
More important question is,
Claire, how do you feel?

26:25.888 --> 26:27.542
I need a reset.

26:29.109 --> 26:31.981
All these years of trying
to find love...

26:34.070 --> 26:37.421
I'm done. I just need
to focus on me.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.859
I'm so happy you're here
with me. Thank you.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.295
Me too.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.301
So that's him?

26:48.258 --> 26:49.738
Yeah, that's him.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.308
I wish I knew
what he had in mind for me.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.571
I don't know what he's got
on his mind,

26:56.702 --> 27:00.575
but I know you've got
Ashley on yours.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.014
Ashley?

27:05.145 --> 27:06.537
Well, she is--

27:06.668 --> 27:07.930
Ravishing?

27:08.061 --> 27:10.933
Yes, exactly.
And she's too young for me.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.762
No, she's my age.
I already asked.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.546
And that would be 34?

27:15.677 --> 27:18.549
Yes. I have been
for the past five years,

27:18.680 --> 27:20.073
and I intend to stay there.

27:21.596 --> 27:24.773
Oh, I've missed you
so much.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.253
I missed you too.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.038
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

27:38.221 --> 27:39.570
Oof.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.705
- Be happy.
- I am.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.276
Yeah,
but you were so drunk,
you fell off your chair.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.670
Ha! I'm Russian.
I feel [speaks Russian].

27:53.323 --> 27:54.455
Ben.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.371
This one's for you,
my friend.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.029
Okay, baby.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.652
Daddy...

29:44.783 --> 29:47.350
- Can you relax, please?
- I am relaxed.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.962
Right. I can see that.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.702
They're good guys.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.924
I think he's getting ready
to sell Golden Rock.

29:56.055 --> 30:00.146
- I can feel it.
- Don't be so pessimistic.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.236
Just let them enjoy
their time here.

30:03.366 --> 30:06.369
Daddy? Please?

30:18.773 --> 30:20.557
I'd like to make a toast.

30:23.256 --> 30:25.562
To Arnie Sandoval.

31:04.079 --> 31:07.256
Arnie would have...
he would have just loved this!

31:09.563 --> 31:11.304
What was he really like?

31:11.434 --> 31:13.872
The man was a legend.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.963
It would take days
to do him justice.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.356
Just a remarkable fellow.

31:20.487 --> 31:23.359
When I first came here
from the States,

31:23.490 --> 31:25.274
Arnie helped me
get set up here.

31:25.405 --> 31:28.625
He was like... the mayor,

31:28.756 --> 31:30.149
the don of the island,

31:30.279 --> 31:32.325
the pope of the Caribbean.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.895
I owe him everything.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.465
It's peaceful here.

31:45.077 --> 31:49.168
Nevis is a place where peace
and harmony is everything.

31:56.784 --> 31:57.741
Charlie...

31:59.308 --> 32:01.876
Do a lot of people
come to the island
just to get married?

32:02.007 --> 32:06.359
Dozens of marriages,
maybe dozens of dozens.

32:06.489 --> 32:10.841
And that includes
quite a few pitched in
by yours truly.

32:10.972 --> 32:15.934
I've married and divorced
four Mrs. Brooks
on this very island.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.327
If you're gonna have
miserable divorces,

32:18.458 --> 32:21.113
you may as well have
magical weddings.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.466
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.948
Come on.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.953
You're impossible.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.827
- What are you
smiling about?

32:41.655 --> 32:44.788
I'm thinking
about how lucky I am...

32:44.919 --> 32:47.574
right now in this moment,
in this place.

32:47.704 --> 32:48.879
Right here.

32:49.706 --> 32:52.753
I finally found out
who my father was,

32:52.883 --> 32:55.364
where I came from.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.627
Sitting here
in this beautiful place...

32:59.890 --> 33:02.023
with my dearest friends
in the world.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.331
Yeah, I'm lucky.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.856
And I just wish
it would never end.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.989
What if it doesn't have to?

33:11.119 --> 33:13.252
What if we just... stay?

33:14.514 --> 33:15.863
A little tipsy, Claire?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.387
I'm drunk, but not on rum.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.041
Must be the beer.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.130
No. It's this place.
It's this moment.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.871
I'm drunk
on the possibilities.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.003
What possibilities?

33:25.133 --> 33:26.743
Of us being here together.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.311
What if we open
a wedding business?

33:29.442 --> 33:31.748
You are drunk.

33:31.879 --> 33:32.923
No, think about it.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.491
- "Paradise Weddings."
- Claire.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.667
I'm happy, finally.

33:37.798 --> 33:41.193
It took me six years
of therapy after my divorce.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.195
I--

33:43.325 --> 33:46.154
I don't believe in marriage,
and I don't think
you believe in it either.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.548
I have to believe in them.

33:49.505 --> 33:50.637
Please.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.382
You got the floor.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.428
Guys! Guys, okay,
I've got an idea.

33:59.559 --> 34:02.083
And I know
it's gonna sound crazy,
but just please hear me out.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.955
What would you say
about staying here?

34:05.086 --> 34:06.740
- She's drunk.
- Just for a while...

34:06.870 --> 34:09.090
for a few months
or like a year,

34:09.221 --> 34:11.092
just so that we can be
together again,

34:11.223 --> 34:14.313
and just live,
and love, and laugh,

34:14.443 --> 34:17.316
- and have fun, and breathe.
-  I love it!

34:17.446 --> 34:19.144
- Doing what?
-  Yeah.

34:19.274 --> 34:21.059
Romantic weddings
at the beach club.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.496
- Oh.
- Just think about it.

34:23.626 --> 34:27.978
The sand, and the sun, and--
and the ocean, and romance.

34:28.109 --> 34:29.893
It's perfect.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.940
And come on, none of us are
particularly happy right now.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.333
- Oh, well--

34:34.463 --> 34:35.812
You might want
to speak for yourself,

34:35.943 --> 34:38.293
because George and I are
really happy together.

34:39.468 --> 34:40.469
Urgh.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.949
Okay, well,
I'm not happy.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.473
And I think I speak
for most of us

34:44.604 --> 34:46.084
when I say we hate our jobs.

34:46.214 --> 34:49.696
And I hate being single
in my stupid flat in London.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.568
And, Theo and Alex, I know
that you guys feel
the same way.

34:52.699 --> 34:56.311
- Yeah.
- So, what if we
just start fresh here?

34:56.442 --> 34:58.748
I'll put it to the guys.
What do you think?

34:58.879 --> 35:00.098
What do we think?

35:00.228 --> 35:01.751
Claire, come on.

35:01.882 --> 35:04.232
What on Earth
do any of us know
about weddings?

35:04.363 --> 35:05.799
I mean, we're not exactly,

35:05.929 --> 35:08.149
you know, shining example
of marital bliss here, okay?

35:08.280 --> 35:09.542
- Hmm.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.805
Oh, come on, babe.
Look at the rest of us.

35:11.935 --> 35:15.025
I mean, single. Single.
Celibate nymphomaniac...

35:15.156 --> 35:16.853
- Ah!
- ...which is a hell
of a condition,

35:16.984 --> 35:18.246
but we're still miserable.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.074
Yeah.
But look, come on.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.945
Even if that was the case,
I mean, we can't
just up sticks,

35:22.076 --> 35:24.905
- and just leave
everything behind.
- Yeah.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.472
But why not?

35:26.602 --> 35:29.736
Come on!
This place is special.

35:29.866 --> 35:32.739
Megan, you heard
how George sang tonight.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.828
That's the George
we know and love.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.744
And, Alex, come on.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.093
Do you really want to be
teaching Chopin

35:39.224 --> 35:41.443
to spoiled rich kids forever?
You hate it.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.706
It's true. I do hate it.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.405
And, Theo,
you haven't even touched
your camera for two years,

35:46.535 --> 35:48.581
and you have nothing
to go back for.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.105
Wow! Tell it like it is.

35:51.236 --> 35:54.891
I mean, how do you
propose to do this plan?

35:55.022 --> 35:57.024
Well, um, I could do
the marketing,

35:57.155 --> 35:59.722
and-- and Ben can be
the host with the most,

35:59.853 --> 36:01.202
like he was back in the day.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.553
And every wedding,
I guess, needs music, so...

36:04.684 --> 36:06.990
- Yes!
- And I suppose I could
do some singing.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.253
<i>♪ Look for... ♪</i>

36:08.383 --> 36:10.777
And I can prepare
the food with Lois!

36:10.907 --> 36:12.474
I could be a bridesmaid!

36:12.605 --> 36:14.824
- Or... ?
- Or I could take
the photographs.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.523
If it's of any help,
I'm an ordained minister.

36:17.653 --> 36:20.047
I always knew it would
come in handy one day.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.267
It's perfect!
We could totally do this!

36:22.397 --> 36:24.704
We can totally do this.
Please say yes, please.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.314
Please, please, please.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.453
To one year off!

36:42.635 --> 36:45.812
- What's going on?
- Looks like we're staying.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.185
Hi, Claire.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.971
You're blocking
my view, Barry.

39:35.634 --> 39:37.940
By the way, it's Harry.

39:38.071 --> 39:41.683
Right. So,
is this your job?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.860
Kind of.

39:44.991 --> 39:47.428
I've been working at the club
ever since I drifted
into this paradise.

39:47.559 --> 39:50.039
Sheldon, Lois and Ashley
are like family to me.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.043
That's very nice
to hear, Larry.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.307
It's Harry.

39:57.438 --> 39:58.570
Sorry?

40:00.180 --> 40:01.399
Never mind.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.314
So, Ashley tells me
that you and your friends

40:04.445 --> 40:06.316
are going to be here
for a whole year.

40:06.447 --> 40:10.146
Maybe. I didn't pack
my crystal ball.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.628
Well, you could always borrow
my Magic 8-Ball in a pinch.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.197
That's a good joke, Jerry.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.810
It's still Harry.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.551
That it is.

40:23.682 --> 40:27.076
Well, okay then.
I'm gonna get back
to the club.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.167
I'm just gonna lie here
for a bit longer.

40:31.298 --> 40:32.473
Bye, Claire.

40:58.586 --> 40:59.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.720
I was wondering,
have you seen my wife?

41:01.850 --> 41:03.765
Uh, yeah. She went
to the market with Lois.

41:03.896 --> 41:04.984
Oh, good.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.205
This is the best.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.642
I found my father's diaries.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.513
- Yeah?
- Ooh.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.385
Here, have a read.
Just read anything.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.261
"Last night,
Rudy Nureyev--"

41:21.391 --> 41:23.089
- Nureyev?
- Nureyev.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.919
"...came over. Such a hoot.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.748
We drank too much vodka
and I beat him at whist.

41:29.878 --> 41:32.838
His ankle was swollen,
and I made him sit with it
above his head,

41:32.968 --> 41:35.536
because it always
does the trick."

41:35.667 --> 41:38.234
- Really, Nureyev?
- Nureyev.

41:38.365 --> 41:41.368
Turns out that my father
truly was a legendary person.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.718
Everything everybody's saying
about him is true.

41:43.849 --> 41:46.155
I mean, he knew everybody.
I'm talking everybody.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.070
He knew Khrushchev,
Che Guevara.

41:48.201 --> 41:51.160
He talks about rolling cigars
with Fidel Castro.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.771
- Castro?
- Yeah. Castro.

41:52.901 --> 41:55.730
- Really?
- It's incredible.
But my favorite...

41:55.861 --> 41:59.342
He knew Ernest Hemingway personally.

41:59.473 --> 42:01.301
He talks about swapping
mojito recipes

42:01.431 --> 42:03.303
with Ernest friggin' Hemingway.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.829
And let me tell you,
there's tons of this stuff.
I mean, it's everything--

42:07.960 --> 42:11.267
it's important,
it's funny, it's fascinating.

42:11.398 --> 42:13.139
I mean, fascinating.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.796
- Hemingway? Hmm.
- Hemingway.

42:33.202 --> 42:36.162
Hold my <i>matryoshkas</i> .
Gentlemen, hello.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.947
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Oh, I'm doing
just fine, thank you.

42:39.078 --> 42:40.079
Have a nice day.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.864
Well, you're going young,
aren't you?

42:42.995 --> 42:45.563
First of all,
they are in their early 20s,

42:45.693 --> 42:50.089
and I am in my early
to [coughs] mid-40s. Okay?

42:50.219 --> 42:52.395
- Cougar.
- Yeah. And your point?

42:54.180 --> 42:56.443
Oh, excuse me.
He is very cute.

42:59.446 --> 43:01.796
- Go easy on my guests.
- Oh, please stop.

43:01.927 --> 43:03.232
You know me.
I'm just looking.

43:03.363 --> 43:06.801
Hey! And I'm liking.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.412
Claire?

43:11.197 --> 43:12.502
Hello, sweetheart.

43:13.852 --> 43:15.375
About last night...

43:15.505 --> 43:17.072
- Yes?
- Um...

43:17.203 --> 43:20.554
Maybe we should hammer out
some of those ideas you have.

43:22.774 --> 43:25.254
I was worried you might have
changed your mind
after the alcohol evaporated.

43:25.385 --> 43:28.649
No, I've never been more sure
of anything in my life, Claire.

43:29.519 --> 43:30.782
Me too.

43:33.001 --> 43:35.613
- Well, first things first.
- What?

43:37.049 --> 43:39.747
Well, now we have to find
someone who wants
to get married.

43:39.878 --> 43:42.881
Oh. Funny
you should say that.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.668
Caroline!
I know, I'm sorry.

43:47.799 --> 43:50.105
No, I...
I wasn't ignoring you.

43:50.236 --> 43:51.498
I should have
called you back.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.631
But I'm calling you now.

43:54.719 --> 43:58.418
Yes, I know. Awful.
I'm so sorry.

43:58.548 --> 44:01.203
Yes. But listen, Caroline.

44:01.334 --> 44:04.337
What would you say
to a romantic wedding

44:04.467 --> 44:07.732
on the most beautiful beach
in the world?

44:07.862 --> 44:10.865
That's the thing.
It <i>could</i> happen.

44:10.996 --> 44:12.388
I could <i>make it</i> happen.

44:19.265 --> 44:21.006
We've got
our first customer, guys.

44:22.964 --> 44:25.010
We are open for business.

We are gathered here

48:58.022 --> 49:00.633
to witness the marriage
of Caroline...

49:01.764 --> 49:03.070
and Alan.

49:03.201 --> 49:05.943
And what a lovely vision
you are, Caroline.

49:06.073 --> 49:07.292
- Thank you.
- And you, Alan.

49:08.119 --> 49:09.729
Reminds me
of my last wedding.

49:09.859 --> 49:11.383
Bittersweet memories.

49:12.210 --> 49:13.559
But this is your wedding.

49:13.689 --> 49:16.214
I can't imagine
that there any objections?

49:17.606 --> 49:20.261
No? Alrighty, then.

49:20.392 --> 49:21.654
Caroline,

49:21.784 --> 49:26.224
do you take Alan
to be your loving husband,

49:26.354 --> 49:30.271
loving him in sickness
and in health,
richer or poorer?

49:30.402 --> 49:31.620
I do.

49:38.453 --> 49:39.672
And you, Alan,

49:39.802 --> 49:42.327
do you take Caroline
to be your loving wife,

49:43.676 --> 49:46.418
loving her and cherishing her,

49:46.548 --> 49:49.203
but also good to obey her?

49:50.683 --> 49:54.252
Obey more than cherish.
That's my two cents.

49:54.382 --> 49:55.514
I do.

50:00.998 --> 50:05.567
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

50:05.698 --> 50:07.091
You may kiss the bride.

50:23.150 --> 50:24.847
Claire,
this is for you.

50:24.978 --> 50:27.633
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

50:27.763 --> 50:30.288
No...

51:01.623 --> 51:03.843
This is the happiest moment
of my life.

51:07.020 --> 51:08.630
To us.

51:26.387 --> 51:27.954
- Clara.
- Alex.

51:39.661 --> 51:40.880
Whoo!

51:45.798 --> 51:48.148
Congratulations
to the happy couple!

51:48.279 --> 51:50.368
-  Congratulations.
-  Congratulations.

51:53.327 --> 51:55.024
Caroline...

51:55.155 --> 51:56.722
- I love you.
- I love you.

52:43.769 --> 52:45.945
I think
we pulled that off.

52:46.075 --> 52:47.599
You did good.

52:48.774 --> 52:52.908
And you're not as annoying
as I thought you would be.

52:55.650 --> 52:56.869
Sorry about
the bouquet thing.

52:58.305 --> 53:00.394
I was trying really hard
not to catch it.

53:00.525 --> 53:03.441
That was
pretty obvious.

53:03.571 --> 53:04.746
Why?

53:04.877 --> 53:06.270
Mm, hold my rum.

53:06.400 --> 53:09.577
I have stories and they are
not fairy tales...

53:11.362 --> 53:14.016
which is probably
why we got off
on the wrong foot.

53:14.147 --> 53:16.802
Did we?
I hadn't noticed.

53:19.457 --> 53:21.981
- So, I have a question.
- That sounds serious.

53:23.330 --> 53:24.810
Where do you live?

53:24.940 --> 53:27.334
I mean, you just show up
at the club every afternoon.

53:27.465 --> 53:30.076
Are you yet another man
leading a shady double life?

53:30.207 --> 53:32.905
I am. I am married,

53:33.035 --> 53:35.908
and I take care of my five
children in the morning.

53:36.038 --> 53:37.605
All called Jock, I bet.

53:37.736 --> 53:41.392
No, no, no. They're all
named Barry Jr.

53:44.351 --> 53:46.962
I'm not buying it.
You're not the marrying type.

53:47.093 --> 53:48.573
I like to think that I am.

53:48.703 --> 53:52.490
I've just committed
too much time to my work.

53:52.620 --> 53:55.667
Oh, so you have a job
other than bumming
around the club?

53:55.797 --> 53:59.410
I do, and I have Ashley
to thank for that.

54:02.456 --> 54:05.938
So, you and Ashley
are close?

54:06.068 --> 54:09.463
We are. We share
the same passion.

54:09.594 --> 54:12.161
And that passion happens to be
what I do in the morning.

54:12.292 --> 54:15.991
Well, my, my. Aren't we
being mysterious?

54:21.345 --> 54:24.304
One day, when you're
not too busy planning ways

54:24.435 --> 54:25.610
to make other people happy,

54:25.740 --> 54:28.743
and maybe you want to make
yourself happy,

54:28.874 --> 54:31.268
would you like to see
where I disappear to
in the morning?

54:34.314 --> 54:35.620
Nah, I'm over it.

55:04.779 --> 55:08.000
- What was that for?
- Mm, because I'm happy here.

55:09.697 --> 55:12.483
Aren't you happy
too, baby?

55:23.058 --> 55:25.452
Golden Rock
is a magical place.

55:25.583 --> 55:27.933
Back then,
it was a secret place

55:28.063 --> 55:31.502
where artists, intellectuals

55:31.632 --> 55:35.027
would come to get away
from the limelight,

55:35.157 --> 55:38.900
having long conversations
with Arnie.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.381
Well, that's nothing...

55:41.512 --> 55:43.644
nothing short of remarkable.

55:45.385 --> 55:47.605
Your father was a humanist.

55:48.606 --> 55:50.695
You would see him
with politicians

55:50.825 --> 55:53.393
you would not expect
to be together,

55:53.524 --> 55:55.439
arguing back and forth.

55:55.569 --> 55:58.616
But what he really,
really loved...

55:59.747 --> 56:01.706
were artists,

56:01.836 --> 56:03.925
many of whom came here.

56:04.056 --> 56:05.187
Why do you...

56:06.972 --> 56:08.974
think it is,
with all of the...

56:10.584 --> 56:12.543
the amazing people
from around the world

56:12.673 --> 56:14.980
that he met
and spoke to and...

56:17.025 --> 56:19.158
- that I never made that list?
- Hm.

56:20.420 --> 56:25.164
I'm absolutely certain
he wanted you to be
on that list.

56:26.339 --> 56:28.428
It never got
a chance to happen.

56:29.821 --> 56:32.606
Knowing now
what kind of a man he was,

56:32.737 --> 56:34.521
he must have had
a good reason

56:34.652 --> 56:37.959
not to contact my mother and me
for all those years, and--

56:38.090 --> 56:39.918
and why would he leave

56:40.048 --> 56:43.878
this home, his estate,
to an estranged son?

56:44.009 --> 56:45.314
There's got to be a reason.

56:45.445 --> 56:46.968
What I can tell you...

56:48.187 --> 56:51.930
is that when he met
your mom in the '60s,

56:53.148 --> 56:57.631
the very definition
of what he was
made him a target.

56:57.762 --> 56:59.154
A target?

56:59.285 --> 57:03.420
The FBI thought
your father was
a Communist.

57:03.550 --> 57:07.119
Well, you do have to admit
that some of the writings
in his diaries

57:07.249 --> 57:10.339
do have a strong tone of,
shall we say,

57:10.470 --> 57:11.732
fringe thinking.

57:12.298 --> 57:14.605
Mm-hmm. Your mother
was torn

57:14.735 --> 57:18.391
between the depth of passion
she felt for him

57:18.522 --> 57:22.134
and her devotion
to your safety.

57:22.264 --> 57:25.006
I am absolutely convinced

57:25.137 --> 57:27.313
that that tension

57:27.444 --> 57:31.448
was a big reason
why your father left.

57:33.667 --> 57:36.017
Ugh. I just, uh...

57:37.105 --> 57:40.326
I can't wrap my head around
everything right now.

57:40.457 --> 57:42.023
- It's just--
- Dad?

57:42.154 --> 57:44.112
Mum's wondering where you are.
She needs help in the kitchen.

57:46.463 --> 57:49.335
Well, good night,
Mr. Katzman.

57:49.466 --> 57:50.684
Ben.

57:50.815 --> 57:52.599
- Good night, Ben Katzman.

57:52.730 --> 57:54.558
That's close enough.

57:54.688 --> 57:56.516
- Night-night, Dad.
- Good night.

58:00.520 --> 58:02.348
I guess I should go
and help my mum, too.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.176
I thought it was
your night off?

58:04.306 --> 58:05.786
Yes, it is.

58:05.917 --> 58:08.180
But if you need me,
you can always call.

58:10.965 --> 58:13.011
Would you like
to go for a walk?

58:13.141 --> 58:15.404
- What? Now?
- Yeah.

58:15.535 --> 58:16.710
It's a beautiful night.

58:18.407 --> 58:20.322
What do you say?

58:20.453 --> 58:21.585
I say yes.

58:21.715 --> 58:23.500
I live on the beach
by the club.

58:23.630 --> 58:24.936
You can walk me home.

58:36.991 --> 58:38.863
Do you think we'll be
single forever?

58:39.994 --> 58:42.867
- Oh, God, I hope so.
- What?

58:42.997 --> 58:45.304
Well, I love lying
like a starfish in the bed.

58:45.434 --> 58:49.830
And who wants to argue
over which way to hang
the toilet paper?

58:49.961 --> 58:51.745
I think I do.

58:57.098 --> 58:58.535
Are you still in love
with George?

1:00:07.647 --> 1:00:09.083
Good morning, Sheldon.

1:00:09.214 --> 1:00:10.432
Good morning,
Mr. Katzman.

1:00:10.563 --> 1:00:11.956
Please, just call me Ben.

1:00:13.218 --> 1:00:15.655
- Good morning, Lois.
- Good morning, Ben.

1:00:15.786 --> 1:00:19.006
- How are you?
- Another lovely day
in paradise.

1:00:19.137 --> 1:00:20.268
Yes, it is.

1:00:21.574 --> 1:00:22.880
Sheldon, I...

1:00:23.010 --> 1:00:25.447
I've read most
of my father's memoirs and...

1:00:26.753 --> 1:00:29.060
there's no mention
of my mother.

1:00:29.190 --> 1:00:32.846
He writes all these wonderful
stories about Golden Rock

1:00:32.977 --> 1:00:35.719
and these amazing people,
but he doesn't mention anything

1:00:35.849 --> 1:00:39.244
about his time
in the United States
or my mother.

1:00:39.374 --> 1:00:41.986
Is there possibly
another journal
that I haven't seen?

1:00:42.116 --> 1:00:44.118
I'm afraid I don't know.

1:00:47.687 --> 1:00:49.080
Alrighty.

1:00:53.388 --> 1:00:57.218
Sheldon Rollins,
you're a bad man.

1:00:57.349 --> 1:00:58.698
What did I do?

1:00:58.829 --> 1:01:02.093
I am a good Christian woman.
Don't you lie to me!

1:01:03.485 --> 1:01:05.749
I gave my word.

1:01:16.411 --> 1:01:19.632
I mean, I have really
caught the light here.

1:01:19.763 --> 1:01:21.721
I mean, look
at the frame on this one.

1:01:23.418 --> 1:01:24.898
Hey, how you doing?

1:01:26.595 --> 1:01:27.771
- Claire. Sweetie.
- Huh?

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:30.643
This frame,
not that one, huh?

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:32.079
Yes. Focus.

1:01:32.210 --> 1:01:34.125
- You know me.

1:01:34.255 --> 1:01:37.737
Wow. These are
actually really good.

1:01:38.782 --> 1:01:40.000
Somebody got
their mojo back.

1:01:40.131 --> 1:01:44.178
Well, I mean,
I am extremely talented.

1:01:45.571 --> 1:01:48.182
- Ben. Right.
-  Wonderful.

1:01:48.313 --> 1:01:49.357
- Guys...
- Hi.

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:51.142
...now that we know
we can crush it,

1:01:51.272 --> 1:01:53.622
it's time to take the next step
and generate some more business,

1:01:53.753 --> 1:01:56.713
which means spending
some money. So, I did.

1:01:56.843 --> 1:01:59.672
I made us a website.
It's gonna be up
in three days,

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:02.501
- Theo, I'll need
some pictures for it.
- You're damn right you will.

1:02:02.631 --> 1:02:05.330
We just need
some more clients.

1:02:05.460 --> 1:02:08.376
I think one more wedding
and we might have
made ourselves

1:02:08.507 --> 1:02:10.857
some legitimate street credibility.

1:02:10.988 --> 1:02:12.424
Yes, I can see it now.

1:02:12.554 --> 1:02:14.382
"Breaking News: Woman Who's
Sworn Off Love Forever

1:02:14.513 --> 1:02:18.909
Suddenly Becomes Miss Wedding
Paradise Organizer
Extraordinaire!"

1:02:19.039 --> 1:02:20.780
- Amen to that. Cheers.

1:02:20.911 --> 1:02:23.478
-  Cheers.
-  Cheers.

1:02:23.609 --> 1:02:24.915
Another perfect day.

1:02:25.045 --> 1:02:28.919
Oh, my gosh. This looks
so amazing, you guys!

1:02:29.876 --> 1:02:33.271
And the asparagus is
so lush and so green, babe.

1:02:33.401 --> 1:02:35.099
I'm just gonna dip it
in the sauce a little bit.

1:02:42.019 --> 1:02:43.150
So good!

1:02:43.281 --> 1:02:46.023
So yummy!

1:02:46.153 --> 1:02:47.720
Mm, can you pass me
the chicken?

1:02:47.851 --> 1:02:50.027
Sure. Knock yourself out.

1:02:50.157 --> 1:02:53.334
Oh,
it's is so tender.

1:02:53.465 --> 1:02:55.859
Mm. I'm just gonna dip it
in the sauce again.

1:02:55.989 --> 1:02:57.164
Oh, it's so good!

1:02:57.295 --> 1:02:59.297
Oh, my gosh.
And the salmon.

1:02:59.427 --> 1:03:00.602
Can I have some of the salmon?

1:03:00.733 --> 1:03:01.821
Oh, my gosh.

1:03:01.952 --> 1:03:05.042
Is this papaya?

1:03:09.307 --> 1:03:10.482
Amazing.

1:03:11.570 --> 1:03:14.181
Hello.
No, I can't hear you.

1:03:14.312 --> 1:03:16.401
Someone seems to be having
an orgasm over lunch.

1:03:16.531 --> 1:03:19.273
No, no, I'm just... no,
I'm just kidding. Who is this?

1:03:19.404 --> 1:03:22.450
And the good news is
that there's plenty left
in the kitchen.

1:03:22.581 --> 1:03:24.583
Yeah, there's gonna
need to be.

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:30.241
Darling, that--
that must slow down.

1:03:30.371 --> 1:03:33.070
Yes, it is papaya.
They do exist.

1:03:34.201 --> 1:03:37.552
Georgie, Georgie,
Georgie, Georgie, good luck.

1:03:43.515 --> 1:03:44.559
So wonderful!

1:03:44.690 --> 1:03:45.734
Baby. Baby. Baby.

1:03:45.865 --> 1:03:46.997
- Mm-hmm?
- Is everything okay?

1:03:47.127 --> 1:03:48.955
Oh, it's way--
it's fabulous!

1:03:49.086 --> 1:03:52.393
You need to just
slow down just a little.

1:03:52.524 --> 1:03:53.786
Hey, guys,
that was Charlie.

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:55.788
I gotta go over
and sign some papers.

1:03:55.919 --> 1:03:57.964
- Can I come? I'll drive.

1:03:58.095 --> 1:03:59.400
Well, sure. Come on.

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:04.710
Baby, I have to, um...
Ahem, uh, yeah.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:05.842
Um...

1:04:07.452 --> 1:04:08.932
- Whatever.

1:04:11.282 --> 1:04:13.284
- Ashley, can I
ask you something?
- Sure.

1:04:13.414 --> 1:04:15.590
Harry says he does something
other than work at the club,

1:04:15.721 --> 1:04:17.505
but it sounds really shady,

1:04:17.636 --> 1:04:19.507
and, you know, guys
who look like him
usually are.

1:04:19.638 --> 1:04:22.206
So, does he actually
have another job?

1:04:22.336 --> 1:04:25.862
Yes, he does.
And he is right behind you.

1:04:25.992 --> 1:04:27.211
So you can
ask him yourself.

1:04:28.386 --> 1:04:29.648
Okay. Good luck with that.

1:04:30.605 --> 1:04:31.955
Look like what?

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.393
- Hi, Claire.

1:04:35.523 --> 1:04:36.698
Hello.

1:04:36.829 --> 1:04:39.701
I wanna show you something.
Come on.

1:04:46.970 --> 1:04:48.885
Your cook is so fabulous.

1:04:49.015 --> 1:04:51.757
I mean, for him to put out
this spread so fast,

1:04:51.888 --> 1:04:54.151
in all the colors
of the rainbow.

1:04:54.281 --> 1:04:56.153
I am--

1:04:56.283 --> 1:04:58.416
About to go viral.

1:04:58.546 --> 1:05:00.809
I love Nevis!

1:05:08.730 --> 1:05:10.645
So, one week's vacation

1:05:10.776 --> 1:05:14.693
turned into you
walking away
from everything?

1:05:14.823 --> 1:05:17.217
Well, not really. I mean,
no one's given up
their homes,

1:05:17.348 --> 1:05:19.524
or sold their businesses
or anything.

1:05:19.654 --> 1:05:21.830
It's more like a sabbatical,

1:05:21.961 --> 1:05:23.876
if any of us were
smart enough to be professors.

1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:30.013
How about you?
Did you leave
anything behind?

1:05:31.753 --> 1:05:33.059
Well, I haven't told
anyone yet,

1:05:33.190 --> 1:05:35.932
but I handed
my notice in at work.

1:05:37.150 --> 1:05:38.804
The wedding business
was my idea,

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:42.503
and I figured I ought to put
my lack of money
where my mouth is.

1:05:42.634 --> 1:05:44.505
We just need
a few more couples.

1:05:44.636 --> 1:05:46.943
So, you're really
going for it.

1:05:47.073 --> 1:05:49.075
A full year off.

1:05:49.206 --> 1:05:52.513
Yes, well, you know,
you only live once.

1:05:53.775 --> 1:05:54.776
Life's not a dress rehearsal,

1:05:54.907 --> 1:05:58.215
and live, laugh,
and love.

1:06:02.045 --> 1:06:03.655
Here we are.

1:06:03.785 --> 1:06:05.396
<i>Casa</i> Buchanan.

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:09.052
A boat. Heh.

1:06:09.182 --> 1:06:11.010
You live on a boat.

1:06:21.499 --> 1:06:25.546
-  Whoa!
This is nice.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:28.636 --> 1:06:30.377
Welcome to Sunshine,
my brothers.

1:06:30.508 --> 1:06:33.293
- You're the famous Sunshine.
- Yes, mon.

1:06:33.424 --> 1:06:34.512
- I'm George. Respect.
- Respect.

1:06:34.642 --> 1:06:35.774
We're here to meet Charlie.

1:06:35.904 --> 1:06:38.037
Charlie is over here
in the pink cabana.

1:06:38.168 --> 1:06:39.517
Sometimes we call it
a house of Judah.

1:06:39.647 --> 1:06:41.388
- Judah.

1:06:41.519 --> 1:06:42.955
Come along.

1:06:46.045 --> 1:06:47.177
Hello, Charlie.

1:06:56.099 --> 1:06:57.274
Is something wrong?

1:06:57.404 --> 1:06:59.276
Nothing's wrong.

1:06:59.406 --> 1:07:01.626
Uh, your message was
a little cryptic.

1:07:01.756 --> 1:07:03.019
I was a little nervous.

1:07:03.149 --> 1:07:05.630
Sheldon called me.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:09.503
He and I were your father's
oldest friends,

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:13.464
which came with a certain
moral protection
of his memory.

1:07:13.594 --> 1:07:16.380
We had to be sure
the time was right...

1:07:17.772 --> 1:07:19.035
to give you this:

1:07:19.948 --> 1:07:24.301
Your father's memoirs
of his trip to America.

1:07:24.431 --> 1:07:26.999
His love affair
with your mother,

1:07:27.130 --> 1:07:28.174
their love letters,

1:07:28.305 --> 1:07:30.133
your birth.

1:07:31.699 --> 1:07:34.267
His soul is in this book.

1:07:35.268 --> 1:07:37.314
Why did you wait until now?

1:07:37.444 --> 1:07:39.925
We had to be sure
you were ready for it.

1:07:41.274 --> 1:07:42.884
And furthermore,

1:07:43.015 --> 1:07:45.452
Sheldon informed me
Lois was gonna kick him
out of the house

1:07:45.583 --> 1:07:47.541
if I didn't give you this.

1:07:49.543 --> 1:07:52.981
All those famous people
you read about in the book,

1:07:54.853 --> 1:07:58.987
Arnie didn't court them.
It was the other way around.

1:07:59.118 --> 1:08:01.033
If he sought
after your mother...

1:08:04.036 --> 1:08:08.301
she must have been
a very, very special woman.

1:08:10.347 --> 1:08:11.609
She was.

1:08:13.306 --> 1:08:14.655
One more thing.

1:08:23.316 --> 1:08:26.798
Your father
left a letter for you.

1:08:32.108 --> 1:08:34.893
Ben, you're ready
to be a Sandoval.

1:09:15.368 --> 1:09:17.414
So what do you
actually do?

1:09:17.544 --> 1:09:19.329
You still think
I'm a beach bum.

1:09:19.459 --> 1:09:22.810
Well,
I didn't say that, per se,

1:09:22.941 --> 1:09:24.682
but if the flip-flop fits...

1:09:25.248 --> 1:09:27.641
Ahem. I mean, obviously
it's something to do
with the ocean.

1:09:27.772 --> 1:09:30.253
So, you teach people to dive,

1:09:30.383 --> 1:09:32.168
or you take boatloads
of American tourists out

1:09:32.298 --> 1:09:34.257
to get drunk and puke
into the Atlantic.

1:09:37.608 --> 1:09:39.740
I'm actually
a conservationist.

1:09:41.133 --> 1:09:43.396
I'm helping document
the biodiversity fluctuation

1:09:43.527 --> 1:09:46.356
around the lower
southeast Caribbean.

1:09:47.661 --> 1:09:48.923
I study fish.

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:51.883
- Wow.
- So...

1:09:52.013 --> 1:09:54.190
what's this long
story of yours?

1:09:54.973 --> 1:09:56.366
Oh...

1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:58.759
Are you worried
I'll judge you?

1:09:58.890 --> 1:10:00.674
No, I'd be worried
if you didn't judge me.

1:10:00.805 --> 1:10:02.850
- Oh, come on.

1:10:02.981 --> 1:10:05.331
- You really don't want
to hear it.
- I really do.

1:10:05.462 --> 1:10:07.377
- I can assure you,
you really don't.
- I really do.

1:10:07.507 --> 1:10:09.727
- But I don't want to tell you.
- But I want you to tell me.

1:10:09.857 --> 1:10:11.859
Okay. It's just men.

1:10:11.990 --> 1:10:13.905
Just lots and lots of men.

1:10:14.035 --> 1:10:19.127
Lots of stupid, weird,
obnoxious, self-centered,
horrible men

1:10:19.258 --> 1:10:23.088
who I've put my career
and life on hiatus for
several times.

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:25.569
So, whilst you've been
out here saving the fish,

1:10:25.699 --> 1:10:30.008
I've just been nursing
a hangover or heartbreak.

1:10:30.138 --> 1:10:31.923
It's pathetic.

1:10:32.053 --> 1:10:34.186
Hm.

1:10:34.317 --> 1:10:38.799
Could you, perhaps, clarify
your use of the word "lots"?

1:10:38.930 --> 1:10:41.976
It's really
not that bad.

1:10:42.107 --> 1:10:43.935
It's just four--
five-- six.

1:10:44.065 --> 1:10:45.980
Oh, that's okay.

1:10:46.111 --> 1:10:47.155
This year.

1:10:47.286 --> 1:10:49.419
W-wow. Uh...

1:10:51.595 --> 1:10:53.945
So what do you think
<i>is</i> wrong with you?

1:10:56.469 --> 1:10:58.341
I think I just attract
the wrong kind of men.

1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:02.997
Not sure what that
says about me.

1:11:05.217 --> 1:11:06.740
Um...

1:11:06.871 --> 1:11:09.352
Yes, well, I really
should be getting back,

1:11:09.482 --> 1:11:11.832
because I have
lots of work to do.

1:11:11.963 --> 1:11:15.096
And it's hard to make
a dramatic exit
off this, isn't it?

1:11:15.227 --> 1:11:17.360
It's okay, Claire.

1:11:19.362 --> 1:11:20.928
Listen, there's...

1:11:21.059 --> 1:11:23.148
something I really
wanna tell you.

1:11:23.279 --> 1:11:24.454
Yes?

1:11:24.584 --> 1:11:29.067
I think that... I found
your next customer

1:11:29.197 --> 1:11:31.548
for your wedding business.

1:11:31.678 --> 1:11:34.855
Oh, right!
Yes, of course.

1:11:34.986 --> 1:11:37.249
- A guy I went
to Berkeley with.
- You went to Berkeley?

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:40.948
Valedictorian,
I'm betting.

1:11:41.079 --> 1:11:42.254
Anyway,
he just got engaged

1:11:42.385 --> 1:11:44.561
and he's having issues
with the venue.

1:11:44.691 --> 1:11:47.303
Oh, this is brilliant.
We're like the wedding vultures.

1:11:47.433 --> 1:11:49.914
Call him now
whilst I'm here.

1:11:50.044 --> 1:11:52.177
Geez, you're--
you're pushy.

1:11:52.308 --> 1:11:54.745
You haven't seen
anything yet.

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:56.877
Just don't make us out
to be too desperate.

1:11:57.008 --> 1:11:58.139
Although we are.

1:12:02.535 --> 1:12:05.843
Kent? Kent, hey.
Yeah, how are you?

1:12:08.062 --> 1:12:10.587
Listen, Kent, I--
I just wanted to ask.

1:12:10.717 --> 1:12:12.197
Did you sort
your wedding yet?

1:12:13.938 --> 1:12:14.982
Uh-huh.

1:12:17.071 --> 1:12:18.290
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:12:19.552 --> 1:12:23.251
But I think I've got
the solution. Hold on.

1:12:24.775 --> 1:12:26.429
- Claire?

1:12:28.866 --> 1:12:31.172
Hello, this is
Claire Chambers
of Paradise Weddings.

1:12:31.303 --> 1:12:33.697
Corporate announcement!

1:12:33.827 --> 1:12:35.089
You can all
stop lounging around

1:12:35.220 --> 1:12:37.048
and acting like you're
on holiday or something.

1:12:37.178 --> 1:12:38.266
We have another wedding!

1:12:38.397 --> 1:12:40.486
-  Ooh.
- Ah-ha!

1:12:40.617 --> 1:12:42.749
Harry has delivered us
the wedding of his friend,

1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:46.057
Kent Jones, of Boston,
Massachusetts, and Sydney,

1:12:46.187 --> 1:12:50.017
the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Carter Whitley III,

1:12:50.148 --> 1:12:52.063
also of Boston, Massachusetts.

1:12:52.193 --> 1:12:55.066
- Blimey!
-  I've spoken to Kent

1:12:55.196 --> 1:12:58.243
- and he's already wired us
the deposit.
- I love him already.

1:12:58.374 --> 1:13:01.681
This one's a little bit
different, though.
Much more old school.

1:13:01.812 --> 1:13:05.032
Kent's future-in-laws
are paying, so we need
to up our game.

1:13:05.163 --> 1:13:07.252
- Mm.
- Okay, good.
So, when is it?

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:08.906
Three weeks.

1:13:09.036 --> 1:13:10.995
What?
No pressure, then.

1:13:12.736 --> 1:13:14.999
Well, I will go get us
some drinks.

1:13:15.129 --> 1:13:17.828
Alrighty. Well, looks like
business is booming.

1:13:17.958 --> 1:13:19.699
Where are you going?

1:13:19.830 --> 1:13:21.527
I'm gonna go find Ashley
and discuss some business strategy.

1:13:21.658 --> 1:13:23.529
Oh, "business strategy."
Is that what you call it?

1:13:23.660 --> 1:13:25.836
Oh, that's funny, George.
But we're just friends.

1:13:25.966 --> 1:13:27.838
Yeah. For now.

1:13:29.230 --> 1:13:33.757
So... you
and Prince Harry, huh?

1:13:33.887 --> 1:13:35.367
Mm-hmm.

1:13:35.498 --> 1:13:37.151
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:13:37.282 --> 1:13:38.762
Oh, come on.

1:13:38.892 --> 1:13:40.459
- It's purely professional.
-  Ugh!

1:13:40.590 --> 1:13:42.548
Professional,
my ass!

1:13:42.679 --> 1:13:44.550
You do look good together.
I'll drink to that.

1:13:44.681 --> 1:13:46.552
Cheers, sweetie.

1:13:46.683 --> 1:13:48.685
- I'm over men.
- Oh.

1:14:11.447 --> 1:14:12.883
Hello.

1:14:18.497 --> 1:14:21.457
- You could hear me.

1:14:21.587 --> 1:14:23.067
- You thought I wouldn't.

1:14:23.197 --> 1:14:24.938
I thought you were
somewhere in Tibet
or something.

1:14:28.420 --> 1:14:29.900
What can I do for you,
Mr. Katzman?

1:14:30.030 --> 1:14:32.163
Ooh, so formal.
Kinda hurts.

1:14:32.293 --> 1:14:34.513
I'm teasing you, Ben.

1:14:34.644 --> 1:14:36.428
- What's up?
- Well, I just want
to let you know

1:14:36.559 --> 1:14:39.344
that we got our next client.
A friend of Harry's.

1:14:39.475 --> 1:14:42.695
His name is Kent something,
comes from Boston money.

1:14:42.826 --> 1:14:44.828
Very wealthy family,
so it's really good for us.

1:14:44.958 --> 1:14:47.265
And, yeah,
that's our next client.

1:14:47.395 --> 1:14:51.138
And I also want to know
if maybe you wanted
to go out to dinner with me.

1:14:51.269 --> 1:14:53.097
Tell me,
what is the connection

1:14:53.227 --> 1:14:55.578
between you having booked
a new client and you
inviting me for dinner?

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:58.406
- Absolutely nothing.
- Thought as much.

1:14:58.537 --> 1:15:00.670
But I have
what they call no game

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.933
when it comes to inviting
a beautiful woman
out to dinner.

1:15:03.063 --> 1:15:05.631
But... just forget
I ever said anything.

1:15:05.762 --> 1:15:09.287
I feel stupid now.
Sorry, I-I interrupted.

1:15:09.417 --> 1:15:11.855
All right.
You have a date.

1:15:13.770 --> 1:15:15.293
All right. Yes.

1:15:17.208 --> 1:15:19.863
- So, shall we meditate?
-  Yes.

1:15:27.348 --> 1:15:28.480
Thank you.

1:15:43.321 --> 1:15:44.627
Yeah.

1:15:44.757 --> 1:15:46.585
I can't believe
that you're a music producer.

1:15:46.716 --> 1:15:49.196
Well, I tried to be.
That's why I left New York
and moved to London.

1:15:49.327 --> 1:15:50.458
I wanted to be
a music producer.

1:15:50.589 --> 1:15:52.199
Couple months
after I was there,

1:15:52.330 --> 1:15:54.245
I was at a club
in Knightsbridge
called Ciro's Pomodoro

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:55.551
and that's where
I met everyone.

1:15:55.681 --> 1:15:57.248
George and Alex,
they were performing,

1:15:57.378 --> 1:15:58.989
and I thought they were
brilliant, and I thought,

1:15:59.119 --> 1:16:01.513
"Hm. Let's see,
I think I can...

1:16:01.644 --> 1:16:03.689
I think I can make
something of this
and promote them.

1:16:03.820 --> 1:16:05.473
Put a show together."
And I did.

1:16:05.604 --> 1:16:07.040
And guess what?

1:16:07.171 --> 1:16:08.825
- It was a complete disaster.

1:16:08.955 --> 1:16:11.305
I mean, disaster.
It was terrible.

1:16:11.436 --> 1:16:13.569
But the beautiful thing
about it was, we became
great friends.

1:16:13.699 --> 1:16:15.571
We've been friends
ever since,
15 years ago.

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:17.007
Yeah, have you ever
been to London?

1:16:17.137 --> 1:16:20.793
Haven't you noticed
my accent? I mean...

1:16:20.924 --> 1:16:23.013
- You must think I'm stupid.

1:16:23.143 --> 1:16:26.016
I have a degree
in environmental studies
from Oxford.

1:16:26.146 --> 1:16:29.367
- Oxford? Ooh.
- Yes, Oxford.

1:16:29.497 --> 1:16:31.195
You thought I never
left Nevis. Admit it.

1:16:31.325 --> 1:16:34.590
No, I didn't. I...
Well, actually I did.

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:36.896
- I know you did.

1:16:38.506 --> 1:16:41.161
How come you left London
and went back to New York?

1:16:41.292 --> 1:16:43.468
I got married.
Met a woman in London,

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:45.818
and her big dream
was to live in New York City

1:16:45.949 --> 1:16:49.300
and own an antique shop,
so I gave everything up.

1:16:49.430 --> 1:16:51.955
Ended up with a divorce
that I never wanted

1:16:52.085 --> 1:16:54.827
and an antique shop
that I never wanted.

1:16:54.958 --> 1:16:56.524
- Do you have children?
- No, no.

1:16:57.830 --> 1:17:00.006
Haven't you noticed
the family tree,

1:17:00.137 --> 1:17:03.140
that there's no name
after mine on that?

1:17:03.270 --> 1:17:05.621
Oh, my God.
You must think I'm so stupid.

1:17:05.751 --> 1:17:07.753
No. No, I don't.
Not at all.

1:17:07.884 --> 1:17:11.104
- Alex tells me
you're also a writer.
- Well...

1:17:11.235 --> 1:17:13.803
I haven't written
anything in a long time.

1:17:16.109 --> 1:17:18.938
You're different
from other guys I meet, Ben.

1:17:19.069 --> 1:17:21.898
- I hope that's a good thing.
- Who knows?

1:17:25.815 --> 1:17:27.643
Do you know why
I brought you here?

1:17:29.296 --> 1:17:31.690
Because this place
is very special. It's...

1:17:31.821 --> 1:17:34.171
Right here,
in this spot,

1:17:34.301 --> 1:17:36.216
today I was given
my father's journal

1:17:36.347 --> 1:17:38.654
that has all of the letters,

1:17:38.784 --> 1:17:40.960
the love letters
between my mother and father.

1:17:48.620 --> 1:17:50.666
Why do you keep
staring at me like that?

1:17:53.059 --> 1:17:54.670
Because I think
you're beautiful.

1:17:56.062 --> 1:17:57.498
Thank you.

1:18:00.327 --> 1:18:01.633
Would you like some dessert?

1:18:01.764 --> 1:18:03.766
Always.

1:18:11.643 --> 1:18:13.384
I really had
a good time tonight.

1:18:13.514 --> 1:18:15.647
- Yes, so did I.
- Yeah.

1:18:15.778 --> 1:18:17.127
Very much.

1:18:19.042 --> 1:18:22.262
Well, I better get back.
A lot of inventory to do.

1:18:26.266 --> 1:18:28.007
Aren't you going to kiss me?

1:19:02.085 --> 1:19:03.739
Good night, Mr. Katzman.

1:19:05.088 --> 1:19:06.567
Good night.

1:20:00.491 --> 1:20:03.755
- Hello?
- Big day today.

1:20:03.886 --> 1:20:07.150
Look at this beauty!
Caught this morning!

1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:09.282
I practically had
to fight for it.

1:20:09.413 --> 1:20:11.284
- Beautiful.

1:20:11.415 --> 1:20:13.896
Oh, and make sure they know
I got up early
to source this snapper,

1:20:14.026 --> 1:20:17.160
because there's none
more fresher on the island.

1:20:17.290 --> 1:20:20.728
I just don't understand
why you won't let the club
do the catering.

1:20:20.859 --> 1:20:22.818
Ugh. Well, where's
the fun in that?

1:20:22.948 --> 1:20:25.472
I love food.
I love cooking.

1:20:25.603 --> 1:20:27.910
Okay, let's do it!

1:20:40.923 --> 1:20:44.840
Dearly beloved,
welcome to paradise.

1:20:46.102 --> 1:20:47.886
We are gathered here

1:20:48.017 --> 1:20:53.413
to witness the marriage
of Kent and Sydney.

1:20:56.112 --> 1:20:57.940
-  Cheers.

1:21:01.073 --> 1:21:02.335
I love you, dear.

1:21:02.466 --> 1:21:04.555
Thank you, Daddy.
I love you.

1:21:04.685 --> 1:21:07.471
-  So great.
- You're stunning, just...

1:21:07.601 --> 1:21:08.994
And you were right,
by the way.

1:21:09.125 --> 1:21:11.692
Who needs a wedding
with 500 guests?

1:21:11.823 --> 1:21:13.085
It didn't cost me
an arm and a leg.

1:21:13.216 --> 1:21:14.957
Daddy!

1:21:15.087 --> 1:21:17.524
- Is everyone having
a wonderful time?
-  Yes.

1:21:19.222 --> 1:21:21.615
May I introduce Megan,
our executive chef?

1:21:21.746 --> 1:21:22.921
Hi, Megan.

1:21:23.052 --> 1:21:25.576
Hello, everyone.
How's the meal so far?

1:21:25.706 --> 1:21:27.012
- Amazing.
- Wonderful.

1:21:27.143 --> 1:21:28.405
Wonderful.

1:21:28.535 --> 1:21:30.711
So, this is Caribbean-sourced
red snapper.

1:21:30.842 --> 1:21:32.235
- Ooh.
- Caught this morning.

1:21:32.365 --> 1:21:33.627
Fresh from the fisherman!

1:21:35.107 --> 1:21:37.762
- Enjoy.
- Okay. Thank you.

1:21:40.199 --> 1:21:41.897
A toast.

1:21:42.027 --> 1:21:44.900
- Not yet. Let's try
this fish, shall we?
- Snapper first.

1:21:46.771 --> 1:21:49.905
-  Oh, gosh.
This is good.
- So smooth.

1:21:50.035 --> 1:21:52.733
-  Oh, it looks
so soft.
-  This looks yummy.

1:21:57.216 --> 1:21:59.915
-  Cheers.

1:22:13.754 --> 1:22:15.539
- Daddy!

1:22:16.627 --> 1:22:18.237
- Mommy?

1:22:22.198 --> 1:22:23.764
What are you--
what are you doing?

1:22:23.895 --> 1:22:26.028
Why is she making
that face?

1:22:26.158 --> 1:22:27.333
Come on, Daddy!

1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:30.815
Mommy,
what are you doing?

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:32.904
- Daddy!

1:22:33.035 --> 1:22:34.123
What's wrong
with Daddy?

1:22:39.432 --> 1:22:41.434
Do something.
Dad! Mommy!

1:22:41.565 --> 1:22:43.175
Daddy!

1:22:44.916 --> 1:22:45.873
Daddy!

1:22:48.267 --> 1:22:49.355
Mommy!

1:22:52.271 --> 1:22:54.491
- Do something!
- Honey!

1:23:00.453 --> 1:23:03.195
Oh, my God!
We're gonna die.

1:23:05.806 --> 1:23:09.723
- Mommy!
- I pooped.

1:23:09.854 --> 1:23:12.683
Oh. My. Gosh.

1:23:12.813 --> 1:23:14.815
Just a minute.

1:23:16.556 --> 1:23:18.558
- Oh, my goodness!

1:23:18.689 --> 1:23:21.170
-  Daddy!
- No.

1:23:21.300 --> 1:23:22.475
No!

1:23:25.217 --> 1:23:28.307
How can you even look at me
and just say you're sorry?!

1:23:28.438 --> 1:23:30.222
Do you even know
what you've done?

1:23:30.353 --> 1:23:34.313
You ruined
the most important day
of my life!

1:23:34.444 --> 1:23:36.837
Do you even understand
the stress that I've
gone through,

1:23:36.968 --> 1:23:39.492
what we have done to be here,
just to get here?

1:23:39.623 --> 1:23:43.540
I spent so much time
picking out a dress for here!

1:23:43.670 --> 1:23:46.021
I don't have a video.
I don't have photos.
I have nothing!

1:23:46.151 --> 1:23:48.719
I will be destroyed!

1:23:48.849 --> 1:23:50.938
And it's all because of you!

1:23:51.069 --> 1:23:53.332
Do you even understand
what you just did?

1:23:53.463 --> 1:23:56.379
I'm going to make sure
my daddy sues you
for every penny you have.

1:23:56.509 --> 1:23:58.033
He will take you down.

1:23:58.163 --> 1:23:59.382
You're incompetent.

1:23:59.512 --> 1:24:02.167
"Paradise Weddings"?
Ha! My ass!

1:24:02.298 --> 1:24:05.040
I should have never
trusted a blonde. Never!

1:24:05.170 --> 1:24:07.607
You poisoned my family.

1:24:07.738 --> 1:24:09.827
Did you see
what I had to see?

1:24:09.957 --> 1:24:14.788
You made my daddy
poop himself
in a $4,000 suit!

1:24:14.919 --> 1:24:16.181
And it's not going
to be forgotten.

1:24:16.312 --> 1:24:18.009
I will not stand for this!

1:24:18.792 --> 1:24:20.664
Are you--
are you even married?

1:24:20.794 --> 1:24:24.146
You're not even married?

1:24:24.276 --> 1:24:26.496
She's not married!

1:24:29.412 --> 1:24:33.068
Kent! Get your ass
in here!

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:49.562
So, how are
the happy couple?

1:24:49.693 --> 1:24:51.608
- Filed for divorce yet?
- It's not funny, Theo.

1:24:51.738 --> 1:24:53.392
That is rich
coming from you, Claire,

1:24:53.523 --> 1:24:55.786
considering you basically
bullied us into this venture.

1:24:55.916 --> 1:24:57.875
The least thing you could have
is a sense of humor about it.

1:24:58.005 --> 1:25:00.834
I didn't bully your stupid wife
into thinking she was
Gordon Ramsey

1:25:00.965 --> 1:25:02.619
when all she knows
about food is from YouTube!

1:25:02.749 --> 1:25:04.142
Don't talk
to my wife like that!

1:25:04.273 --> 1:25:06.884
- Don't just blame Megan!
- No, it was the fish.

1:25:07.014 --> 1:25:08.668
We should've used
the catering company.

1:25:08.799 --> 1:25:11.280
Shut up, Alex!
And stop being a bitch
for once in your life.

1:25:11.410 --> 1:25:13.499
- No, she's right,
okay? She's right.

1:25:13.630 --> 1:25:15.762
It's my fault.
I should have known better.

1:25:15.893 --> 1:25:18.287
But if one more person says
I should have used
the catering company,

1:25:18.417 --> 1:25:20.637
I'm gonna throw myself
into the nearest volcano!

1:25:20.767 --> 1:25:22.247
Please, be my guest.

1:25:22.378 --> 1:25:23.683
Look, baby.
It's not your fault.

1:25:23.814 --> 1:25:25.207
Oh,
cut the crap, George.

1:25:25.337 --> 1:25:27.905
"It's not your fault, baby."
Whose fault is it, huh?

1:25:28.035 --> 1:25:29.907
You guys remember
the first wedding?

1:25:30.037 --> 1:25:32.562
It was perfect.
It was freaking perfect.

1:25:32.692 --> 1:25:34.520
Rubbish! Utter crap!

1:25:34.651 --> 1:25:37.567
It was a fluke!
We got through
by the skin of our teeth.

1:25:37.697 --> 1:25:40.047
He's right. We have
no idea what we're doing.

1:25:40.178 --> 1:25:42.006
- That's not true!
- Someone could have died!

1:25:42.137 --> 1:25:44.269
I mean, by the way,
are we insured?

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:46.880
Nobody did die. And, no,
I didn't take insurance.

1:25:47.011 --> 1:25:49.361
- Did you?
- It's your bloody company!

1:25:49.492 --> 1:25:52.408
- That's why we're here.
- Please just stop it!

1:25:52.538 --> 1:25:55.585
Can everyone relax?
It is everybody's fault.

1:25:55.715 --> 1:25:57.717
Yeah, but mostly Megan's.

1:25:57.848 --> 1:26:01.199
I'm the one that ruined
everything. I know
that I ruined everything!

1:26:01.330 --> 1:26:04.202
Baby, Harry just said
it's all of us.
It's all our faults.

1:26:04.333 --> 1:26:05.769
Yeah, but he
doesn't mean it.

1:26:05.899 --> 1:26:07.858
None of you guys mean it.

1:26:07.988 --> 1:26:10.948
You guys all laugh
at me behind my back.
You think I'm an idiot.

1:26:11.078 --> 1:26:14.212
You guys are all just a bunch
of self-obsessed losers,

1:26:14.343 --> 1:26:18.173
with your stupid hats
and your boring old stories
about the old days.

1:26:18.303 --> 1:26:22.655
- Look, Megan, it's okay--
- No! No! Stop
apologizing for me!

1:26:22.786 --> 1:26:26.311
I wanna go home.
I don't like it
in here anymore, okay?

1:26:26.442 --> 1:26:30.141
I messed up. I'm sorry.
I just wanna go home.

1:26:30.272 --> 1:26:33.579
I am sorry I messed up!
Okay? I'm sorry!

1:26:33.710 --> 1:26:36.191
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1:26:39.150 --> 1:26:42.501
Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks.

1:27:51.701 --> 1:27:53.268
For goodness' sake.

1:27:54.573 --> 1:27:56.401
What's wrong
with you people?

1:27:58.142 --> 1:27:59.535
Are you just
gonna give it up?

1:28:01.188 --> 1:28:02.581
Are you gonna
throw it all away

1:28:02.712 --> 1:28:04.714
and scuttle back
to your everyday lives

1:28:04.844 --> 1:28:06.193
as if nothing happened?

1:28:07.499 --> 1:28:10.372
You haven't given
the island a chance.

1:28:10.502 --> 1:28:14.419
You arrived and you fell
into the whole holiday
beach vibe mentality,

1:28:14.550 --> 1:28:17.770
and all you could think about
was having fun and creating
a business.

1:28:17.901 --> 1:28:22.122
You couldn't just sit
and let the island
speak for herself.

1:28:24.342 --> 1:28:26.605
Right, come on.

1:28:27.389 --> 1:28:28.868
I'm taking you on a hike.

1:28:49.498 --> 1:28:51.761
<i>This is
the beating heart of Nevis.</i>

1:28:56.069 --> 1:28:57.462
<i>This is what grounds me...</i>

1:28:59.595 --> 1:29:01.466
<i>what feeds my soul.</i>

1:29:05.644 --> 1:29:08.343
<i>What calls me back every time
I leave the island.</i>

1:29:12.042 --> 1:29:15.262
<i>I need this like I need
the air that I breathe.</i>

1:29:17.395 --> 1:29:19.571
<i>This is where I found
how to live.</i>

1:29:21.181 --> 1:29:23.793
It's where I found myself.

1:29:26.056 --> 1:29:29.494
This place gives me the rhythm
by which I live my life.

1:29:30.887 --> 1:29:32.671
<i>And it's a part of me.</i>

1:29:37.197 --> 1:29:39.112
<i>But only because I let it in.</i>

1:30:39.564 --> 1:30:41.305
<i>"My dear son...</i>

1:30:43.307 --> 1:30:46.876
<i>I've lived a full life
with only one regret:</i>

1:30:48.443 --> 1:30:51.010
<i>leaving you.</i>

1:30:51.141 --> 1:30:53.970
<i>I held you in my arms
when you were born,</i>

1:30:54.100 --> 1:30:57.495
<i>but I had to leave
all too soon.</i>

1:30:59.279 --> 1:31:01.543
<i>I've been thinking
about that day</i>

1:31:01.673 --> 1:31:04.110
<i>every moment of my life.</i>

1:31:05.590 --> 1:31:08.854
<i>Your baby smile...</i>

1:31:08.985 --> 1:31:12.989
<i>I don't want you to hold
any bad feelings
towards your mother.</i>

1:31:13.119 --> 1:31:16.296
<i>We were very much in love.</i>

1:31:16.427 --> 1:31:20.170
<i>But she was terrified
that I would be arrested.</i>

1:31:20.300 --> 1:31:22.477
<i>So I left.</i>

1:31:22.607 --> 1:31:25.784
<i>We decided that it was
better this way.</i>

1:31:25.915 --> 1:31:28.657
<i>I respected her wishes
to go away.</i>

1:31:30.746 --> 1:31:32.574
<i>But now that I am gone,</i>

1:31:33.966 --> 1:31:37.230
<i>I want you to know
who you are.</i>

1:31:37.361 --> 1:31:41.234
<i>You are my son, my blood.</i>

1:31:41.365 --> 1:31:45.848
<i>The roots of your family
are on this island.</i>

1:31:45.978 --> 1:31:49.242
<i>Our history
is in your blood,</i>

1:31:49.373 --> 1:31:51.506
<i>so I leave this house
to you...</i>

1:31:52.942 --> 1:31:56.293
<i>because it's the history
of our family.</i>

1:31:56.423 --> 1:31:59.035
<i>I hope your life here
will be full of joy.</i>

1:32:00.906 --> 1:32:03.996
<i>Love this island, my son.</i>

1:32:04.127 --> 1:32:06.825
<i>She will give you
more than you can imagine.</i>

1:32:08.435 --> 1:32:10.263
<i>I love you.</i>

1:32:10.394 --> 1:32:14.398
<i>Your father, Arnie Sandoval."</i>

1:34:38.194 --> 1:34:41.545
-  <i>Mazel tov!</i>
