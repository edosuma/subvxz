WEBVTT

00:01.371 --> 00:03.488
How can you do this to me, Clem?
Have a stupid dinner party

00:03.573 --> 00:05.657
instead of an out of
control bachelorette party?

00:07.277 --> 00:10.028
Is it because you hate me?
(gasps) You hate me.

00:12.121 --> 00:14.165
Come on, Ben, it'll be fun.

00:14.251 --> 00:15.950
We'll have hors d'oeuvres, some wine,

00:16.001 --> 00:17.418
play charades.

00:17.454 --> 00:18.920
Charades? Terrific. Okay.

00:18.955 --> 00:21.339
Two words.
First word: I want to kill myself.

00:23.593 --> 00:25.960
I'm sorry, Ben,

00:26.012 --> 00:28.096
but I've had my partying days,
and I'm over it.

00:28.131 --> 00:30.181
I don't need some big shindig.

00:30.267 --> 00:33.134
"Shindig"?

00:33.186 --> 00:35.220
My God. What's happened
to my old friend Clem?

00:35.305 --> 00:37.856
Oh, I know.
She turned into my old friend Clem.

00:39.643 --> 00:42.727
Let it go, dude.
Fun Clem is gone, but, hey, man,

00:42.813 --> 00:45.396
I'm around if you ever want
to hit up some bars in Newark

00:45.482 --> 00:48.032
that accept my Canadian I.D.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.902
Oh, honey, I don't do Jersey.

00:54.157 --> 00:56.324
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, sweetie.

00:56.376 --> 00:57.542
How's it going, Ben?

00:57.627 --> 00:59.190
I'd be better if your
girl was letting me

00:59.196 --> 01:00.995
throw her an actual bachelorette party.

01:01.047 --> 01:03.414
Wait, isn't your bachelor
party tomorrow night, too?

01:03.500 --> 01:07.302
Yeah, that way we only have
to spend one night apart.

01:07.337 --> 01:09.387
Ugh.

01:09.472 --> 01:11.222
Please tell me you're having a blowout.

01:11.308 --> 01:14.208
Oh, yeah. Going out to get
some big, fat, juicy steaks

01:14.261 --> 01:15.844
with my dad and my best man, Spence.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.479
A-And then you're going
to your bachelor party?

01:19.850 --> 01:21.599
That is his bachelor party.

01:21.651 --> 01:24.569
Oh, girl. Now I know
what happened to you. Him.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.071
Me? What did I do?

01:27.157 --> 01:28.940
You're a bad influence on my Clemmy.

01:29.025 --> 01:30.408
How am I a bad influence?

01:30.493 --> 01:33.077
I barely drink, I've never smoked,
I don't do drugs.

01:33.163 --> 01:36.114
Exactly. You sound like a
personal ad on Christian Mingle.

01:37.701 --> 01:40.285
This girl used to be so much fun.

01:40.370 --> 01:42.253
And I'm not saying it's
all because of you, Nick,

01:42.339 --> 01:44.756
but the fun ended
immediately when you began.

01:44.841 --> 01:48.710
Ben, you are out of your mind.
I pride myself on being fun.

01:48.762 --> 01:50.929
And not just at home,
ask any of my students.

01:51.014 --> 01:53.247
I am the funnest World
Literature professor

01:53.300 --> 01:55.433
at NYU, okay?

01:56.636 --> 01:59.604
And that proves what? I'm sorry,
I just nodded off for a second.

02:01.358 --> 02:03.889
Nick doesn't have to prove anything.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.927
We have all kinds of fun.

02:05.979 --> 02:08.696
In fact, tonight
we're going to check out

02:08.732 --> 02:10.448
the open house at Shannon's school,

02:10.532 --> 02:13.401
and after, we're gonna pop
by Ruby Tuesday's for the...

02:13.453 --> 02:16.821
BOTH: Peanut Butter Dream Bar.

02:18.241 --> 02:21.409
Clem, blink twice if you're
here against your will.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.296
♪ ♪

02:33.446 --> 02:36.090
Hey, Shannon,
I met five of your teachers,

02:36.142 --> 02:38.509
and only one of them knows who you are.

02:39.980 --> 02:42.764
And FYI, not a fan.

02:44.484 --> 02:46.184
SHANNON: Oh, God, here comes Evan.

02:46.269 --> 02:49.020
All right, be prepared to rescue me.

02:49.834 --> 02:50.772
Oh, hey, Shannon.

02:50.824 --> 02:55.360
Hey, Evan, look, I'm really not... Oh.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.696
Just let us know when you're
ready for us to jump in.

02:59.342 --> 03:02.283
What the hell was that?
Usually I can't get rid of that kid.

03:02.335 --> 03:04.502
Looks like Evan's got a girlfriend.

03:04.587 --> 03:06.955
What? Girlfriend?

03:07.007 --> 03:08.840
No, no, no, no, no.

03:08.925 --> 03:11.542
No, the popular girls must've
dared her to talk to him.

03:11.628 --> 03:13.011
And hold his hand.

03:15.042 --> 03:16.998
And kiss him.

03:17.585 --> 03:21.102
Wow, she will do anything to fit in.
(laughs)

03:25.991 --> 03:27.775
I thought your sister
couldn't stand Evan?

03:27.811 --> 03:30.979
Oh, she can't,
but now that he's got a girlfriend,

03:31.031 --> 03:33.180
he's instantly attractive to her.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.116
Man, if I could go back to high school

03:35.151 --> 03:38.453
knowing what I know now,
things would be so different.

03:39.197 --> 03:40.655
Would you still be in Magic Club?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.407
Yes.

03:44.661 --> 03:46.878
So I guess not that different.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.497
I'm gonna talk shop with
the English department.

03:49.549 --> 03:51.249
Okay.

03:52.198 --> 03:55.362
Oh, hello! Hi, I'm Felicia, Sam's mom.

03:55.397 --> 03:57.305
- Clem Barnes.
- Oh, you must be Shannon's mom.

03:57.340 --> 03:59.974
Oh, no, no, no.
(chuckles) I'm her sister.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.043
Her "not that much older" sister.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.479
Malinda, come meet Clem.

04:04.514 --> 04:06.097
Wait, are you Shannon's mom?

04:06.182 --> 04:09.150
Sister! I'm her sister.

04:09.185 --> 04:12.053
Well, it's nice of you to spend your
Friday night at Shannon's school.

04:12.105 --> 04:14.105
When I was your age,
I would've been out clubbing.

04:14.190 --> 04:20.111
(laughs) Yeah, when I was my age,
I would've been out clubbing, too.

04:20.736 --> 04:22.079
Hey, Shannon,
I was just talking about you

04:22.165 --> 04:23.998
with your English teacher Mr. Rudner.

04:24.034 --> 04:26.334
Oh, he's my favorite teacher.

04:26.369 --> 04:29.370
Okay, go ahead, tell him how I'm doing.

04:29.988 --> 04:31.506
Not well.

04:32.743 --> 04:35.209
I think you mean, "not good."

04:38.854 --> 04:42.050
I love teaching,
but some students are a challenge.

04:42.085 --> 04:44.802
Yeah, I know. I'm also a teacher.
I'm over at NYU.

04:44.888 --> 04:48.084
Oh! I'd love to get to the big leagues.

04:48.119 --> 04:49.757
I had to take a second
job just to get by,

04:49.809 --> 04:52.310
and I'm the most popular teacher here.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.145
I've got five stars on RateMyTeacher.

04:54.230 --> 04:56.364
RateMyTeacher? I don't know it.

04:56.399 --> 04:58.361
Oh, it's a rating site
high school kids use.

04:58.396 --> 05:00.568
College students, too.
You should check yourself out.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.120
Yeah, I really don't need a website

05:02.205 --> 05:04.655
to tell me how I'm doing.
I get enough feedback every day

05:04.741 --> 05:07.625
just looking at the smiles on
my students' faces. (chuckles)

05:07.710 --> 05:09.327
What's the website again?

05:10.081 --> 05:10.995
RateMyTeacher.

05:11.081 --> 05:12.497
Yeah, I'm not gonna look at that.

05:12.582 --> 05:15.166
Is that a dot com or dot org situation?

05:17.420 --> 05:19.921
It was so weird being
around all those parents

05:19.973 --> 05:21.506
at Shannon's school.

05:21.591 --> 05:23.141
What's weird is this is
a bachelorette party,

05:23.226 --> 05:25.843
and the only phallic thing here
are these artisanal pickles.

05:27.263 --> 05:30.398
And they're so tiny.

05:30.433 --> 05:33.935
Oh, and did I tell you
that I joined the PTA?

05:33.987 --> 05:37.304
Which is crazy because I am not a "P."

05:38.197 --> 05:39.740
But you do got the "T" and "A."

05:42.247 --> 05:42.693
CLEM: Hey, Shannon.

05:42.779 --> 05:45.613
Are you excited to go to your
first ever bachelorette party?

05:45.665 --> 05:47.582
What bachelorette party?

05:47.617 --> 05:49.150
Dude, you just got some tiny pickles

05:49.202 --> 05:50.585
and are playing charades.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.253
(knocking on door)

05:54.757 --> 05:57.758
Oh, hi. Sorry.
I thought this was Evan's place.

05:57.794 --> 05:59.326
No. He lives across the hall.

05:59.379 --> 06:00.845
Oh, that's funny,
I must've had the wrong...

06:04.767 --> 06:07.101
Meow!

06:07.137 --> 06:10.938
Yo, Ben, you don't think I'm fun?

06:10.974 --> 06:12.940
Look at what my students
are saying about me

06:12.976 --> 06:15.309
on RateMyTeacher.

06:15.361 --> 06:18.980
"Professor Stewart makes learning fun.

06:19.032 --> 06:20.314
Five stars."

06:20.366 --> 06:24.619
"Most fun I've ever had in class.
Five stars."

06:24.654 --> 06:26.687
"Fun and kind of a babe.

06:26.739 --> 06:29.040
Five stars and a chili pepper emoji."

06:30.043 --> 06:31.079
BEN: Oh, here's one.

06:31.114 --> 06:33.767
"Professor Stewart is a total bore.
One star."

06:34.664 --> 06:36.581
I thought you couldn't trust
anything on the Internet.

06:36.666 --> 06:38.499
Wait, what? I am not boring.

06:38.551 --> 06:41.535
RaisinBran99?
What-What's this kid's problem?

06:41.588 --> 06:45.372
Sweetie, it's just one bad
review out of 1,000 great ones.

06:45.425 --> 06:47.141
- Wh-Why would he say that?
- I know why.

06:47.177 --> 06:48.843
Because you're boring.

06:50.563 --> 06:52.680
Don't let it bother you, Nick. I mean,

06:52.732 --> 06:54.098
I'm not bothered by the fact that

06:54.184 --> 06:57.602
all the women at Shannon's school
thought that I was her mother,

06:57.687 --> 07:02.240
even though it would basically
be biologically impossible.

07:03.910 --> 07:07.111
But you go have fun at your party, babe.

07:07.197 --> 07:09.113
All right, you, too. Love you.

07:09.199 --> 07:12.783
Are you actually reading
<i>They Came to Talk?</i>

07:12.869 --> 07:14.919
Who's "they"? They sound horrible.

07:16.148 --> 07:18.706
Oh, yeah, that's the other thing.

07:18.758 --> 07:21.092
Those ladies I met made
me join what they called

07:21.177 --> 07:23.678
"The Fun Moms Book Club."

07:23.713 --> 07:26.097
"Fun Moms Book Club"?

07:26.182 --> 07:29.250
Each word more chilling than the last.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.603
What is happening? I'm 27 years old,

07:32.689 --> 07:36.440
and I'm talking about the
book club and the PTA,

07:36.526 --> 07:38.526
and I'm wearing an apron!

07:41.040 --> 07:42.263
What am I doing, Ben?

07:42.315 --> 07:44.115
You're dying is what
you're doing. Dying.

07:46.202 --> 07:47.318
And look at all this.

07:47.403 --> 07:49.570
I mean, I've turned
my bachelorette party

07:49.622 --> 07:51.906
into a snooze fest.

07:51.958 --> 07:55.826
Well, that's it. The snooze fest is off.

07:55.912 --> 07:57.378
What are you saying?

07:57.413 --> 08:02.049
I am saying that the <i> booze</i> fest is on!

08:02.085 --> 08:03.634
(both screaming)

08:10.542 --> 08:12.425
(salsa music playing)

08:12.461 --> 08:13.760
All right, I'm here.

08:13.795 --> 08:16.596
Finally. What took so long?

08:16.665 --> 08:18.598
The erotic bakery was closed,

08:18.667 --> 08:21.667
so I had to improvise
at the supermarket.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.436
I don't think anyone's gonna notice.

08:25.524 --> 08:27.223
Holy moly!

08:27.771 --> 08:30.193
I know, right?
They took a kids' baseball bat cake

08:30.278 --> 08:32.645
and turned it into this.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.063
And those are...?

08:35.150 --> 08:37.951
- Two Pikachus.
- Oh...

08:37.986 --> 08:39.953
That's why they have eyes.

08:39.988 --> 08:42.822
(knocking on door)

08:42.874 --> 08:45.575
Ooh! Our first partier has arrived!

08:46.723 --> 08:48.495
Hello... Oh!

08:48.547 --> 08:50.046
Rose, hi.

08:50.081 --> 08:52.999
I brought my famous ambrosia salad.

08:53.051 --> 08:55.301
You can't come to a
dinner party empty-handed.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.673
- Hello, Ben.
- Rose!

09:01.661 --> 09:05.645
What the hell is your future
mother-in-law doing here?

09:06.305 --> 09:08.214
I forgot that she was on the invite list

09:08.266 --> 09:10.683
for the dinner party.
What am I gonna do?

09:10.735 --> 09:12.552
She's gonna freak out
if she sees the cake.

09:12.604 --> 09:14.404
Well, hello.

09:19.072 --> 09:20.360
It's a baseball bat.

09:20.412 --> 09:22.162
Mm-hmm.

09:22.197 --> 09:25.365
And the little yellow things with eyes?

09:26.094 --> 09:28.284
Those are testicles.

09:31.039 --> 09:32.622
I'm sorry, Rose.

09:32.707 --> 09:35.575
We just decided to switch the
party a couple of hours ago.

09:35.627 --> 09:37.410
And you forgot to call me.

09:37.462 --> 09:39.629
I know. It's my fault, completely.

09:39.714 --> 09:42.182
And if you want to go,
I totally understand,

09:42.217 --> 09:45.051
'cause this party's
gonna get a little crazy.

09:45.798 --> 09:47.637
- It is?
- Yeah.

09:48.437 --> 09:50.807
Thank the Lord!

09:51.715 --> 09:52.488
What?

09:52.688 --> 09:54.611
For the life of me,
I could not understand

09:54.696 --> 09:57.614
why you were gonna have
some boring dinner party.

09:59.618 --> 10:01.734
But now that I see this...

10:05.073 --> 10:09.576
I say, Ben,
make Mama a big ole margarita.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.714
God, I wish Nick had a gay brother

10:14.749 --> 10:17.083
so I could marry into this family.

10:20.338 --> 10:21.638
Found him, Mr. B!

10:22.473 --> 10:23.482
'Sup?

10:23.517 --> 10:27.500
Shannon, hey.
Uh, what are you doing here?

10:27.535 --> 10:29.145
Just thought maybe you
could tutor me in math,

10:29.180 --> 10:30.262
like you always do.

10:30.348 --> 10:31.881
I don't tutor you in math.

10:31.933 --> 10:33.849
I do your math homework.

10:34.452 --> 10:36.218
Oh, my God, is that Beth?

10:36.270 --> 10:38.921
Hi, Beth, I didn't know you were here.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.473
Yes, you did.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.758
You shut the door in
my face an hour ago.

10:43.448 --> 10:44.610
So, what are we doing?

10:44.696 --> 10:46.812
We were about to play <i> Mario Kart.</i>

10:46.898 --> 10:50.282
Yeah, but unfortunately,
we only have two controllers, so...

10:50.368 --> 10:52.568
All right, I'll stay.

10:55.184 --> 10:59.131
Whoa. Beth, did you create
your own character?

10:59.144 --> 11:00.943
That looks exactly like you.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.679
That's Donkey Kong.

11:04.109 --> 11:06.215
That's Donkey Kong?

11:08.252 --> 11:10.469
Whoa, twinsies.

11:12.364 --> 11:13.671
To Nick, huh?

11:13.725 --> 11:15.591
- To Nick. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

11:16.354 --> 11:18.094
Mm.

11:18.962 --> 11:20.462
You okay, son?

11:20.515 --> 11:22.181
I know getting married is a big step...

11:22.266 --> 11:25.634
Who the hell is RaisinBran99?

11:25.686 --> 11:27.737
(stammers)

11:27.772 --> 11:29.972
And why would he say I'm boring?
I need to know.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.607
Oh, my God, are you still on this?

11:31.659 --> 11:34.476
Come on, man. Tonight's all
about having fun with your boys.

11:34.529 --> 11:37.163
Or in this case, your boy, and your dad.

11:38.449 --> 11:40.032
You know what? You're right. My bad.

11:40.118 --> 11:41.667
I got to put this whole
thing out of my mind,

11:41.753 --> 11:42.818
have a good time.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.153
- Hell yes.
- Yeah.

11:44.205 --> 11:45.788
Whiskey shots for...

11:45.840 --> 11:47.456
Brandon Gilbert.

11:47.508 --> 11:48.924
- Who is Brandon Gilbert?
- Brandon Gilbert?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.794
Is RaisinBran99.
It's got to be Brandon Gilbert.

11:51.846 --> 11:53.462
He's always eating
raisins during my lecture.

11:53.514 --> 11:54.964
It drives me nuts.

11:55.016 --> 11:57.767
I won't be able to enjoy myself
until I set that kid straight.

11:57.802 --> 12:00.169
You sound crazy.
Walt, tell him he sounds crazy.

12:00.221 --> 12:04.723
I say we find Raisin Boy right now,
and take him down.

12:06.811 --> 12:08.527
(laughs) Yeah.

12:08.613 --> 12:10.780
(people whooping)

12:10.815 --> 12:13.482
(laughs)

12:13.534 --> 12:15.234
Ooh! Baby,

12:15.319 --> 12:18.487
I am so sorry. I never should have said

12:18.539 --> 12:20.906
I did that thing with Walt.

12:22.710 --> 12:26.662
Baby, if you're gonna play Truth
or Dare, you've got to play it.

12:26.714 --> 12:28.247
And you played it.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.416
(laughs)

12:30.501 --> 12:31.667
- Mm.
- Mm.

12:31.719 --> 12:33.552
- (exhales)
- (laughs) You know,

12:33.638 --> 12:35.370
Rose, I never thought in a million years

12:35.423 --> 12:37.423
that I'd be able to, you know.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.925
What? Party with me?

12:40.011 --> 12:41.543
No. No, no, no. Not at all.

12:41.596 --> 12:43.395
I never thought that I'd be able to...

12:43.481 --> 12:45.047
Oh, right. Yes, party with you.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.182
(both laugh)

12:46.983 --> 12:48.851
Well, Clem,
I know that when you look at me,

12:48.903 --> 12:51.353
you see a woman who is
totally put together,

12:51.405 --> 12:55.324
full of confidence,
never makes a mistake.

12:56.157 --> 12:58.727
And all that is true.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.614
But there's a different side to Rose.

13:01.699 --> 13:06.619
And I like to call her Ms. Fantastic.

13:07.562 --> 13:09.755
Just got off the phone,
the stripper's coming in an hour.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.574
Stripper?

13:12.627 --> 13:14.176
No, we-we don't want a stripper,
do we, Rose?

13:14.212 --> 13:17.463
Oh, Rose does not.

13:17.548 --> 13:20.266
But Ms. Fantastic?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.352
She didn't come here
for the chips, baby.

13:26.330 --> 13:27.723
What the hell are we watching?

13:27.775 --> 13:30.726
Only the greatest episode
of <i> Black Mirror</i> ever.

13:30.778 --> 13:33.279
Yeah, this one's an allegory
about life that makes you

13:33.364 --> 13:36.765
question both our reality
and what it means to exist.

13:36.817 --> 13:41.270
Hey, how about, instead,
we watch <i> Floribama Shore?</i>

13:41.322 --> 13:43.605
It's an allegory about
trying to get laid

13:43.658 --> 13:46.208
on the Floribama Shore.

13:48.629 --> 13:50.913
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

13:50.965 --> 13:53.448
Don't forget to light a match.

13:53.501 --> 13:56.118
That's not what I'm doing.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.753
What are you doing here?

13:57.805 --> 13:59.121
You never come over,

13:59.173 --> 14:01.557
then I have a girlfriend,
and suddenly, here you are.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.727
I just don't like that you're
with her, okay?

14:04.762 --> 14:07.062
It makes me feel weird,
and I don't know why.

14:08.357 --> 14:10.566
But I do know this:

14:11.397 --> 14:13.352
she's not the right girl for you.

14:14.099 --> 14:15.688
So...

14:15.773 --> 14:19.074
who is the right girl for me?

14:19.110 --> 14:22.111
I don't know.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.080
What are you guys talking about?

14:25.116 --> 14:27.082
- Dinosaurs.
- You.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.590
Well, well, well.

14:34.625 --> 14:38.627
(all shushing)

14:39.266 --> 14:41.830
(whispering): Well, well, well.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.284
Professor Stewart.
What are you doing here?

14:44.302 --> 14:46.385
I saw on Facebook
you were here, Brandon.

14:46.470 --> 14:50.389
Or should I call you RaisinBran99?

14:51.533 --> 14:52.775
Oh, no.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.343
I am not boring.

14:54.395 --> 14:57.780
And I'm not gonna let your dumb
review ruin my bachelor party.

14:57.815 --> 14:59.732
Wait. This is your bachelor party?

15:01.535 --> 15:02.785
Two friends?

15:02.820 --> 15:05.487
I'm his father.

15:05.539 --> 15:07.740
So you're spending your bachelor party

15:07.825 --> 15:11.360
with your dad in a library.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.295
Yeah, you're not boring.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.633
Oh, my God, I'm...

15:18.607 --> 15:19.918
I'm boring.

15:20.004 --> 15:24.206
It's okay. You know,
you have other good qualities.

15:25.285 --> 15:26.642
Thank you, Spence.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.478
(chuckles) That's why I'm your best man.

15:29.513 --> 15:32.681
Well, that's it. I'm done being boring.

15:32.733 --> 15:34.329
Sorry, guys. The bachelor party's over.

15:34.402 --> 15:36.819
- Whoa, what are you talking about?
- Ben was right.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.388
It's my fault Clem's having
this lame-ass dinner party.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.856
So I'm-a go home, rescue her,

15:40.908 --> 15:43.392
and then we're gonna
go out and get crazy.

15:43.444 --> 15:45.861
'Cause my girl deserves to have fun.

15:45.913 --> 15:47.579
Whoo!

15:48.699 --> 15:52.734
I never want this night to end!

15:52.787 --> 15:54.703
(all cheering)

16:01.186 --> 16:02.155
Nick?

16:02.190 --> 16:03.272
What are you doing here?

16:03.358 --> 16:04.957
Why aren't you at your bachelor party?

16:05.026 --> 16:07.226
I left because I realized
I was dragging you down.

16:07.295 --> 16:10.063
If it wasn't for me, you'd be
having some liquor-drenched blowout

16:10.131 --> 16:12.131
instead of some boring
dinner party with my mom.

16:12.802 --> 16:14.300
Don't worry about your mom.

16:14.369 --> 16:17.070
Your mom is enjoying herself plenty.

16:17.138 --> 16:18.838
Well, to hell with these
lame-ass parties.

16:18.907 --> 16:21.941
Okay, get your coat. I'm taking you
out for a night we will never forget.

16:22.010 --> 16:25.478
No, no, no.
A night we will never remember!

16:26.581 --> 16:30.717
Yeah, I don't think we're
gonna have to go out for that.

16:30.769 --> 16:32.719
♪ ♪

16:34.055 --> 16:37.140
Oh, no. You drink water
on your own time, cowboy.

16:37.225 --> 16:38.858
Come on!

16:39.704 --> 16:41.894
Dinner party, huh?

16:41.946 --> 16:44.614
I see you've moved on to dessert.

16:46.951 --> 16:48.901
I didn't do this because
you drag me down,

16:48.953 --> 16:50.236
because you don't.

16:50.715 --> 16:52.488
I did this because...

16:52.574 --> 16:54.774
I didn't want to feel like a mom.

16:55.721 --> 16:58.494
You know who else doesn't
feel like a mom? My mom.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.413
Shake it, baby, shake it.

17:04.169 --> 17:06.502
I am so happy I get to marry you.

17:06.588 --> 17:08.621
Please tell me that we're
gonna party like this

17:08.673 --> 17:10.839
every night for the rest of our lives.

17:10.925 --> 17:13.425
Oh, absolutely.
Except for the naked man.

17:15.930 --> 17:18.347
Absolutely.

17:20.769 --> 17:24.270
This is an intense game of charades.

17:24.321 --> 17:26.239
I like it.

17:27.942 --> 17:31.744
Oh, my God. Mr. Rudner?!

17:32.578 --> 17:33.696
Shannon?

17:34.312 --> 17:35.698
Wait, you two know each other?

17:35.784 --> 17:39.035
Yeah. Dude, that's my English teacher.

17:41.956 --> 17:43.706
Pants. Pants. Where's my pants?

17:44.568 --> 17:45.792
No, no, no.

17:45.844 --> 17:48.294
I think you mean, "Where <i> are</i> my pants?"

17:50.131 --> 17:54.467
I assume that "D"
on my paper will be turned into a "C"?

17:55.970 --> 17:58.688
I'll take your "D," Mr. Rudner.

18:09.207 --> 18:10.476
Hey, Evan.

18:10.528 --> 18:13.362
Where's Donkey Kong?

18:13.448 --> 18:15.314
You mean Beth. (chuckles)

18:15.366 --> 18:17.283
I broke up with her.

18:17.335 --> 18:19.059
You did? Why?

18:19.070 --> 18:22.488
Because... I like you.

18:22.540 --> 18:25.997
And last night it seemed
that maybe you liked me, too.

18:26.044 --> 18:28.377
Well, I don't.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.805
Maybe last night I did
when you were with Beth,

18:32.851 --> 18:35.834
but now that I know you're not...

18:35.887 --> 18:37.553
I don't know.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.232
I think those feelings went away.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.890
So what are you saying?

18:40.975 --> 18:43.709
The only way you're into me
is if I'm into someone else?

18:43.761 --> 18:46.679
(scoffs) Nah.
No, dude, I'm not that shallow.

18:48.516 --> 18:50.850
Or am I?

18:50.902 --> 18:53.603
Oh, my God, I think I am.

18:53.688 --> 18:56.555
Man, that's dark.

18:56.608 --> 18:57.990
You know what?

18:58.026 --> 19:00.610
I'm gonna see i-if Beth
will get back with me

19:00.695 --> 19:03.112
so that you and I have a shot.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.281
Hey, good luck with that, kid.

19:07.202 --> 19:10.086
(sighs) Why did we party
until 6:00 in the morning?

19:10.171 --> 19:12.738
(sighs) Because your mom dared us to

19:12.790 --> 19:15.208
at 5:00 in the morning.

19:15.260 --> 19:17.710
I think I got partying out of my system.

19:17.762 --> 19:21.631
I know. I heard it leaving your system.

19:21.716 --> 19:25.051
Hey, kids. Good morning.

19:25.103 --> 19:29.421
What a beautiful day for a walk.

19:29.474 --> 19:31.807
How are you not hungover?

19:31.893 --> 19:33.559
(scoffs) Hangovers are for amateurs.

19:33.611 --> 19:35.278
- And she's a professional.
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.397 --> 19:38.030
Cowboy.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.982
Ms. Fantastic.

19:44.405 --> 19:46.489
Let's walk, baby.
