[theme music]

00:46.114 --> 00:48.982
[laughing]

00:50.084 --> 00:55.989
[music playing]

00:56.090 --> 00:58.226
Hey Mom, add these.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.828
Well, that's just what these
triple-fudge brownies need,

01:00.928 --> 01:02.863
more chocolate.

01:02.963 --> 01:03.964
What are the other
girls bringing

01:04.064 --> 01:06.867
to the slumber party, insulin?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.169
Mother, please.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.937
Hey Beck, check it out.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.339
What is it?

01:11.439 --> 01:14.074
It's an 8-track.

01:14.175 --> 01:18.512
It's like, a blast
from the past, man.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.881
Mother, tell your husband
these are the eighties.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.750
Well, Becky, I guess
you're old enough

01:22.850 --> 01:24.418
to know the grim truth.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.254
Your father is frozen in time.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.658
We're just going to
skip the eighties

01:30.758 --> 01:33.394
and try to thaw him
out in the nineties.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.428
Go ahead and take it.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.798
It'll be trippy.

01:37.898 --> 01:38.899
I'm going to go pack.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.838
Far out!

01:44.938 --> 01:46.540
Hey, what time's your game?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.441
I don't know.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.376
Around three.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.110
How's the arm, sport?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.145
OK, I guess.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.513
Hey, I'm all set for the game.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.414
Hey no batter!

01:53.514 --> 01:54.515
[inaudible]

01:54.615 --> 01:56.917
[interposing voices]

01:58.319 --> 01:59.453
Hold it.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.454
What now?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.556
The Lanford Lightning
Bolt ain't going

02:02.656 --> 02:04.458
no place without breakfast.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.860
I'm just going out to the
garage to get my glove, OK?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.767
You know, it comes to me,
Dan, that our middle child

02:13.867 --> 02:15.969
is kind of, how do
you say, out of sorts.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.171
Pre-game jitters.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.539
I used to get them myself.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.707
All your great ones do.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.743
Yeah, well how soon before
the game do these here

02:22.843 --> 02:24.678
jitters set in, because
she's come flying

02:24.778 --> 02:27.047
off the handle for two weeks.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.616
Seems like business
as usual to me.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.651
Well, guess again.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.520
Darlene the chocolate
queen just walked

02:32.620 --> 02:34.355
by a plate of
triple-fudge brownies

02:34.455 --> 02:35.723
without even breaking stride.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.425
She's in training, babe.

02:37.525 --> 02:41.462
Well, thank you, The Amazing
Conner, for unraveling yet

02:41.562 --> 02:44.865
another sports-related mystery.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.834
I'm going over to Ernie's
to field some grounders.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.903
Yeah, first you're going
to field some breakfast.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.239
Fine.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.540
Hey kiddo, I'm
going to really try

02:52.640 --> 02:55.142
to make it over there today,
but it doesn't look good.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.977
I gotta pour a driveway
over on the west side.

02:57.077 --> 02:57.878
Don't worry about it.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.046
It's OK.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.949
But I'm gonna be there.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.851
Would you guys
just leave me alone?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.053
I don't need you there
to watch me pitch.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.020
Pitch, pitch, pitch.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.188
All she ever does is pitch.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.464
Where's Mom?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.065
She and DJ went
to wash the car.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.733
Did she say when
she'd be back?

03:19.833 --> 03:20.868
Nope.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.271
Did she say anything
about coming to my game?

03:23.371 --> 03:24.838
Not to me, why?

03:24.938 --> 03:26.807
Nothing.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.976
Will you be mad if
she misses the game?

03:29.076 --> 03:31.679
My life would be perfect
if she missed the game.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.547
It's already halfway perfect.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.848
Dad's not gonna be there.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.984
Are they getting
on your nerves?

03:37.084 --> 03:39.720
Becky, every time they
come to one of my games,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.755
Dad starts yelling,
"We batter, we batter,

03:41.855 --> 03:45.125
we batter, swing batter!"

03:45.225 --> 03:50.798
And Mom, she throws snow
cones at the umpire.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.700
She does not.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.268
She did once!

03:54.368 --> 03:56.504
I'm telling you,
they're complete nerds.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.138
Hey, wait 'til
you start dating,

03:58.238 --> 03:59.373
and Dad asks the
guy you're going out

03:59.473 --> 04:02.009
with if he has popcorn money.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.479
- I'm not dating, ever.
- It doesn't matter.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.281
They'll always find a
way to embarrass you.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.549
Believe me.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.017
It's not fair.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.486
I mean, parents are supposed
to stay in the house.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.555
Except when they're
driving you somewhere.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.392
Then they're just supposed
to drop you off and go away.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.661
In a perfect world, Darlene.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.229
In a perfect world.

04:22.330 --> 04:26.400
I mean, look what Dad got
me to take to Diane's.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.868
What's that?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.771
Like, a blast
from the past, man.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.841
They can't be
our real parents.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.742
Nerd alert.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.643
Nerd alert.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.445
Becky, you've got to help me.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.079
I don't want Mom
to come to my game.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.515
DJ: I'm gonna go watch TV.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.617
Darlene, what did I tell
you I was going to do if I

04:43.717 --> 04:45.819
found these on the couch again?

04:45.919 --> 04:48.188
Look, just give me the
shoes and hold the lecture.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.222
Darlene.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.558
Listen, Miss
Smart Mouth, you're

04:50.658 --> 04:51.959
not going to be
needing those shoes

04:52.059 --> 04:54.628
because you're not going to play
baseball again till you're 58.

04:54.728 --> 04:55.963
Fine with me.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.731
I don't want to play anyway
if you're going to be there.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.371
Did you ever throw a
snow cone at an umpire?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.406
You weren't there.
You didn't see the call.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.047
I'm here.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.483
Me too.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.217
Aunt Jackie, you brought it.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.221
Yes, do you remember
the sleeping bag?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.156
Oh my god, you
still have that thing?

05:23.256 --> 05:25.626
Yes, Mom gave this to me
when I moved out, in case

05:25.726 --> 05:30.230
I needed a place to stay
for the rest of my life.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.333
There are cow
girls all over it.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.536
Becky, those aren't
just cow girls.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.438
That is the cow girl.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.906
That's Annie Oakley.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.809
There's no way I'm taking
that to my slumber party.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.111
I guarantee you no one
will have one like this.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.145
Yeah, including me.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.847
I'd rather sleep in a trash bag.

05:46.947 --> 05:47.981
Well, they're under the sink.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.518
You better take two.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.586
Oh, mother.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.487
Jeez.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.524
Oh, if this bag could talk.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.727
I'd cut its
tongue out, I would.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.029
You remember how much we hated
this thing when mom brought

06:02.129 --> 06:03.764
it back from that yard sale?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.799
They could have at least
turned off the sprinklers.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.603
Give me a break!

06:12.540 --> 06:14.374
I thought you were going
to Darlene's ballgame.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.478
Well, Darlene and I aren't
exactly talking these days.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.378
We're yelling.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.180
And you both do it so well.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.882
Yeah, and I usually enjoy it.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.984
But boy, lately she's
driving me crazy.

06:24.084 --> 06:24.885
Oh, Roseanne.

06:24.985 --> 06:25.986
She's 11.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.855
Remember all the trouble
we used to give Mom?

06:27.955 --> 06:31.224
Yeah, but Mom deserved it.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.993
Whereas Darlene
has me, you know?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.662
And I'm the perfect mother.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.229
Oh, yeah, right.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.130
I forgot.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.031
[laughing]

06:38.131 --> 06:39.500
I'm serious, Jackie.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.603
I'm the antithesis of
everything Mom stood for.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.237
Oh, Darlene would
be against you

06:44.337 --> 06:45.405
no matter what you stood for.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.740
You're her mother.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.943
Well doesn't this stuff skip
a generation or something?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.879
I don't remember having
this problem with Becky.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.146
Sure you did.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.048
Becky was just too polite
to say anything about it.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.416
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.317
But hey, It's not just you.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.351
It's Dan too.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.553
It's all parents.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.054
You're just going
through what is commonly

07:01.154 --> 07:04.658
known as the "I have no parents,
I was hatched from an egg"

07:04.758 --> 07:06.159
syndrome.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.562
I just can't wait
'til you have kids, man.

07:08.662 --> 07:13.967
[phone ringing]

07:14.067 --> 07:14.868
Hello.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.272
What happened?

07:19.372 --> 07:20.173
Which hospital?

07:23.010 --> 07:23.911
I'll be right there.

07:24.011 --> 07:27.280
No, she's not allergic
to penicillin.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.181
What?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.784
Darlene's in the hospital.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.920
- Becky, get down here now!
- What happened?

07:33.020 --> 07:34.387
It's appendicitis.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.723
Well, how do we get
in touch with Dan?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.290
We can't, there's no
phone on the job site.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.425
You want me to stay
here with the kids then?

07:38.526 --> 07:39.927
No, Becky can watch DJ.
You go with me.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.161
Mom, what's wrong?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.229
Your sister's in the
hospital with appendicitis.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.396
Oh no, what do
you want me to do?

07:43.497 --> 07:44.431
Darlene's in the hospital?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.666
She'll be OK, honey.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.600
You stay here with DJ.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.601
I'm gonna go start the car.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.802
And when dad gets
home, tell him me

07:48.902 --> 07:50.437
and Jackie are in county
hospital emergency room.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.506
- OK.
- I want to go with you.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.406
You can't, honey.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.775
Yeah, DJ.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.110
You and me gotta stay here and
give this note to daddy, OK?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.812
I want to go with Mom!

07:58.912 --> 08:00.247
I'm counting on you, Becky.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.214
Mom!

08:01.314 --> 08:02.182
[door slamming]

08:02.282 --> 08:03.250
DJ, come on.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.618
I'll let you have some
more brownies, OK?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.030
Mrs. Conner.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.932
Ted Graham, Darlene's
baseball coach.

08:19.032 --> 08:19.833
Oh, Ted.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.635
Hi, how is she?
- I don't know.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.770
They won't tell me anything.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.039
Well they're sure as
hell going to tell me.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.276
[foreign speech]

08:29.376 --> 08:34.247
Look, we are trying to
find somebody who speaks

08:34.347 --> 08:35.583
whatever it is you're speaking.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.317
ANNOUNCER: Dr. Clark to OR five.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.320
I can't find the
blank insurance form.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.622
I'm Roseanne Conner.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.890
I'd like to see my daughter.

08:42.990 --> 08:46.994
For the third time,
file cabinet top drawer.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.061
Conner?

08:48.161 --> 08:48.962
Conner.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.398
Right, Darlene Conner.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.399
What happened?

08:52.499 --> 08:53.300
I don't know.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.635
She was out there on the mound.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.069
She was having a good day.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.405
She was three innings
into a no-hitter!

08:58.505 --> 09:00.808
And then boom, she went
down like a ton of bricks.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.576
Here you go, Mrs. Chambers.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.377
All done.
- Great.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.879
I'd like to see my daughter.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.447
Darlene's being
prepped for surgery.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.949
Dr. Bryce will take
you to see her.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.751
Well, now how
is Darlene doing?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.519
We haven't been
advised of her condition.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.088
Dr. Dr. Bryce to
emergency, please.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.157
Mrs. Conner is there
anything else I can do?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.359
No, we'll be OK, but
I really appreciate

09:19.459 --> 09:20.794
your coming down here with her.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.262
Tell her she got the win.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.731
Thanks, I'll tell her.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.166
ANNOUNCER: Dr. Wagner,
please call extension 32.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.870
Dr. Wagner, please
call extension 32.

09:29.970 --> 09:30.904
How is she?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.405
They're getting her
ready for surgery.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.306
You've seen her?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.374
No.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.709
Well, are they
gonna let us see her?

09:35.809 --> 09:38.879
As soon as the doctor gets
here, and she's on her way.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.681
- How you doing?
- Been better.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.287
Oh, god.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.555
Hey.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.757
Hey.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.459
Lake Ranoma.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.694
What?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.062
What was it, five years ago?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.898
We were up in that cabin, and
Becky had a lung infection.

09:57.998 --> 10:02.302
And we thought-- well, we
both know what we thought.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.738
We got through that, right?

10:04.838 --> 10:05.639
OK.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.607
This is just like Lake Ranoma.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.508
OK.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.147
Mr. And Mrs. Conner?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.415
Yes?

10:15.515 --> 10:16.950
Hi, I'm Dr. Bryce.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.820
I'll be operating on Darlene.
- Can we see her?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.088
I'm afraid that's
not possible.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.022
She's being taken into surgery.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.156
Well they said
we could see her.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.059
Mr. And Mrs. Conner,
this is the situation.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.963
Darlene's appendix has ruptured,
causing her to run a fever.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.932
Now, under normal
circumstances, we

10:32.032 --> 10:34.201
try to bring the fever
down before we operate.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.235
But?

10:35.335 --> 10:36.837
But there appears
to be an obstruction

10:36.937 --> 10:39.072
of the intestines, which
means we can't wait

10:39.172 --> 10:40.007
for the fever to come down.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.409
We have to operate now.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.610
Is that dangerous?

10:43.711 --> 10:48.081
I mean, is it dangerous?

10:48.181 --> 10:50.784
I can't tell you not to worry.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.419
You'll do that anyway.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.321
I'm a parent, too.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.523
There are dangers
associated with any surgery,

10:56.623 --> 10:59.993
but I can assure you that this
is not an uncommon procedure.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.061
How long does it take?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.663
Well, it usually
takes about two hours.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.666
And when it's over, I'll
come out, I'll talk to you,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.468
and then you can see Darlene
in the recovery room.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.606
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah?

11:13.707 --> 11:14.574
Yeah.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.676
They probably do
this 20 times a day.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.078
Not on our daughter.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.718
- Did Darlene have chicken pox?
- Yeah.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.353
November '83.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.821
- You want some coffee, sis?
- Measles?

11:27.921 --> 11:28.956
No.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.424
What?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.492
Yeah, she had the--

11:32.592 --> 11:34.361
just let me do it.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.929
I don't know how you
remember all this stuff.

11:36.029 --> 11:36.864
What stuff?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.065
Like when Darlene
had the mumps.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.366
Well because she had
the mumps at the same time

11:39.466 --> 11:41.001
DJ and Becky had the mumps, Dan.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.203
You just don't forget three
kids having simultaneous mumps,

11:43.303 --> 11:45.005
you know?
- Conner?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.173
Yeah, is something wrong?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.574
Oh, no.

11:47.674 --> 11:48.842
Well, yes.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.444
Your insurance card's expired.
- That can't be, Dan.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.712
I paid that bill last month.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.613
Are you sure?

11:53.713 --> 11:54.882
What do you mean am I sure?

11:54.982 --> 11:56.383
I have the canceled
check at home.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
Why don't you just get
those clowns on the phone.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.020
There's an 800
number on the back.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.288
- I'll call them.
- No, you sit down.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.223
I'll call them.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.893
When you finish these
forms, if you just return

12:05.993 --> 12:08.195
them to the admissions desk.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.196
Yeah, I'll do that.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.998
I know the future
of medical science

12:11.098 --> 12:14.301
depends on knowing my
mother's maiden name.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.635
I can't believe this.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.171
My kid's in surgery and I'm
sitting here taking my SATs.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.473
Roseanne, just
forget about the forms.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.943
That's just their way of having
people sit down and shut up.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.078
Well, whatever
happened to ether?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.479
What are you talking about?

12:26.579 --> 12:30.117
My wife mailed you
that check last month.

12:30.217 --> 12:34.421
I don't know what day she mailed
it, but I know you got it.

12:34.521 --> 12:38.959
Listen, I'm in a hospital
where my kid's getting surgery.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.362
I don't have the
canceled checks on me.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.763
Yeah, I'll hold.

12:43.864 --> 12:44.731
Oh, damn.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.766
Why this morning,
of all mornings,

12:46.867 --> 12:49.436
did I have to yell at Darlene?

12:49.536 --> 12:52.039
Because she was being
a pain in the butt.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.741
Oh Jackie, she's
just being 11.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.409
Roseanne, yelling at Darlene.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.777
That's like breathing.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.214
It's just an
involuntary response.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.251
I still feel like
the mom from hell.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.919
Well, there's only
one solution to that.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.356
You take a vow right this
minute that you will never yell

13:09.456 --> 13:13.726
at Darlene again in life, ever.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.696
Yeah, think of all
the free time I'll have.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.631
Yes, I do.
No.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.566
No.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.335
Because you cashed it.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.337
That's right, you cashed it.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.906
And I have that
canceled check at home

13:26.006 --> 13:28.375
because I balanced the checkbook
last month, and I have it.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.742
Well somebody there
did, because I've

13:29.843 --> 13:32.112
got a canceled check at home
with your company's name on it.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.581
Right, and just ask
for the supervisor.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.616
Look, let me talk to
somebody else there, all right?

13:36.716 --> 13:38.118
Yeah, I'll hold.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.019
Here, honey.

13:39.119 --> 13:39.987
Here.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.721
Good luck.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.622
Hello.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.557
This is Mrs. Conner.

13:44.657 --> 13:49.096
C-O-N-N-E-R. Yeah.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.331
C as in cat.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.100
O as in oaf.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.868
N as in numbskull.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.436
N as in nitwit.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.939
E as in empty-headed.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.842
R as in target.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.545
I feel like I ought
to be doing something.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.416
I feel like that all the
time, especially at work.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.919
I feel totally useless.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.054
I'm just sitting here and
Darlene's getting operated on.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.722
Well Dan, what
do you want to do?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.757
Assist?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.758
I just hate waiting.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.726
I hear you.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.062
Nobody hates waiting
worse than me.

14:22.162 --> 14:26.266
I'd bite other people's
nails if they'd let me.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.300
Get away from me.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.547
How are you my wife.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.215
Is OK?

14:42.315 --> 14:43.516
You better take
him up on it, Jackie.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.120
That's liable to be
your last proposal.

14:47.220 --> 14:52.292
No, what you mean to say
here is, how is my wife?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.927
Is she OK?

14:54.027 --> 14:55.028
Is she OK?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.629
Then you take it to
that desk over there,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.098
and good luck to you.
- [inaudible]

14:58.198 --> 14:59.732
- Yeah, OK.
- She OK.

14:59.832 --> 15:00.700
All right.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.205
What'd they say?

15:05.305 --> 15:06.139
Everything's OK.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.242
They just spelled
our name wrong.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.278
I'm gonna call Becky.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.279
Yeah, that's a good idea.

15:19.052 --> 15:22.289
Becky, help me find
the piece for here.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.923
DJ, you're supposed
to put the outside

15:24.024 --> 15:25.458
of the puzzle together first.

15:25.558 --> 15:29.896
Darlene said always
start with the dog's tail.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.031
OK.

15:31.131 --> 15:31.931
Here.

15:32.032 --> 15:32.832
Thanks.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.202
[phone ringing]

15:35.302 --> 15:36.136
Hello?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.105
Hi honey, it's daddy.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.039
Is Darlene OK?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.340
Yeah she's going to be fine.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.241
How you guys doing?

15:41.341 --> 15:44.211
Let me talk.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.212
Hi.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.047
Who is this?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.515
Dad, when you coming home?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.183
It won't be long now, sport.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.353
OK, bye.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.621
Hi.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.056
Hi, sweetheart.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.624
How you holding up?

15:57.724 --> 15:59.192
OK, I guess.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.528
Just OK?

16:01.628 --> 16:02.662
Dad?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.064
Yeah, honey?

16:04.164 --> 16:06.499
I'm a rotten sister.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.667
What are you
talking about, baby?

16:07.767 --> 16:08.568
You're a great sister.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.570
No, I'm not.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.938
Sure you are, kid.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.841
Hey, who's been taking such
great care of DJ all afternoon?

16:14.941 --> 16:16.976
No, that's not what I mean.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.080
I mean I tried to keep
thinking about Darlene,

16:20.180 --> 16:23.583
hoping she's OK and
everything, but--

16:23.683 --> 16:26.053
But you start thinking
about other stuff?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.787
Yeah.

16:27.887 --> 16:32.592
Dumb stuff like that stupid
slumber party, and Chip.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.462
Well honey that doesn't
mean you're a rotten sister.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.729
It's just when
your brain figures

16:36.829 --> 16:38.765
it's thought about
something for too long,

16:38.865 --> 16:43.236
it switches over to something
else so it doesn't overheat.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.271
It's not gonna work, Dad.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.605
I'm not going to laugh.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.539
No, no, no, no.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.208
I'm just trying
to say that if you

16:48.308 --> 16:50.177
think about something
for too long,

16:50.277 --> 16:52.379
smoke will come out your ears.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.613
Dad, quit it.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.615
And steam will come
out of your nose.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.549
Daddy.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.119
Fire will shoot
out of your mouth.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.455
Chippy-whippy will love that.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.590
Hell, I'll love it too.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.192
I won't have to buy no
more charcoal starter.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.113
Hey, would you knock it off?

17:26.213 --> 17:27.013
What?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.415
That, you're driving us crazy.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.117
Oh, come on you guys.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.685
Dan, that operation's
supposed to be over by now.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.022
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

17:36.123 --> 17:36.923
Excuse me.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.125
Yes?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.659
I'd like to know what's
going on with my daughter.

17:39.759 --> 17:40.760
Your daughter's name?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.363
For the millionth time,
it's Darlene Conner.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.931
Oh, right, the appendectomy.

17:45.031 --> 17:45.832
No, wrong.

17:45.932 --> 17:46.966
She's not an appendectomy.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.235
She's a little girl.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.936
She's having an
operation, and it's

17:50.036 --> 17:51.538
supposed to be over by 5:30.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.507
If I had some answers,
I would give them to you.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.808
I ask one little question.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.210
What's happening with my kid?

17:57.310 --> 17:59.546
No one can tell me anything.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.648
That's not a stupid question.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.417
That's a question that
deserves an answer.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.487
That's a question any human
being has a right to know.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.956
What's going on with our kid?

18:10.056 --> 18:10.857
You tell 'em, kiddo.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.196
Mr. And Mrs. Conner.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.165
- Is Darlene all right?
- She's fine.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.570
So what am I yelling about?

18:23.670 --> 18:24.704
She's in recovery.

18:24.804 --> 18:25.938
Can we see her?

18:26.038 --> 18:27.740
Well, she's just
coming out of anesthesia,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.609
but I can take
you in to see her.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.510
Hey Jackie, would you--

18:30.610 --> 18:32.545
I'll call Becky.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.647
What are sisters for?
- Damned if I know.

18:46.125 --> 18:46.959
Mom?

18:47.059 --> 18:48.828
Yeah, honey.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.197
How you doing, sport?

18:50.297 --> 18:51.531
Hi, Dad.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.466
Does it hurt?

18:53.566 --> 18:56.303
I can't really feel anything.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.704
Can you feel this?

18:57.804 --> 18:58.605
[kissing]

18:59.606 --> 19:01.741
I'm really sorry.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.010
Sorry for what?

19:04.110 --> 19:06.446
About the way
I've been acting.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.848
I've been kind of a smart mouth.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.083
Well, you take after me.

19:11.184 --> 19:11.984
Yeah, Darlene.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.085
It's kind of out of your hands.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.758
It's just that sometimes--

19:18.858 --> 19:20.092
I don't know.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.862
Well, Darlene, don't
you think I was 11?

19:22.962 --> 19:25.498
Don't you think I had a mother?

19:25.598 --> 19:28.067
And I used to wish that there
was some kind of machine

19:28.167 --> 19:31.204
where you could just do this.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.606
And she'd disappear.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.543
That's not exactly how I feel.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.411
Yeah, but you gotta admit
that a gadget like that

19:38.511 --> 19:41.548
would come in handy sometimes.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.716
You mean like
at baseball games?

19:43.816 --> 19:46.519
Look, when you don't want
us around, you just tell us

19:46.619 --> 19:49.556
and we'll cry our
hearts out and leave.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.324
You're not going
anywhere now, right?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.559
I mean, you're gonna
stay right here.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.461
Oh yeah, I'm
here for the night.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.463
I brought my sleeping bag.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.364
Thanks, Mom.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.078
I found it, Darlene!

20:15.648 --> 20:16.549
What?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.117
The floor of your room!

20:20.953 --> 20:23.490
Mother, please
don't make me laugh.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.892
I still have stitches, you know.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.994
Now don't you think
all that ice cream might

20:28.094 --> 20:32.164
spoil your mid-afternoon snack?

20:32.265 --> 20:35.167
Hey, I need all the
strength I can get.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.136
You've been home for
a week now, Darlene,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.272
and you're going to school
tomorrow no matter what.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.973
So quit milking this thing.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.043
Nice bedside manner.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.512
Why, thank you.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.280
Now get your damn
feet off my couch.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.315
Don't worry.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.250
I won't tarnish your
beautiful fabric.

20:51.351 --> 20:55.322
Darlene when are you going
to stop being a smart mouth?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.490
Three weeks from next Tuesday.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.027
What is your major
malfunction, numbskull?

21:01.127 --> 21:03.296
Didn't your mommy
and daddy give you

21:03.396 --> 21:05.665
enough love when
you were growing up?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.435
Please don't fall off
that sofa and stain

21:08.535 --> 21:12.472
my beloved carpet, that
would break my beating heart.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.073
Now why don't you get on board.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.342
Why don't you get with a winner.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.509
Climb on board.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.410
Ride with us.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.413
We're going to victory!

21:20.513 --> 21:22.915
Please take your
sneakers off that couch,

21:23.015 --> 21:24.884
or you are wallpaper.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.853
Am I being read clear?

21:26.953 --> 21:30.557
Do you understand
me Private Conner?

21:30.657 --> 21:32.592
OK, I'm wallpaper.

21:32.692 --> 21:37.697
Now could you guys
get outta here?

21:37.797 --> 21:38.931
Oh, Darlene.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.569
We are just so happy you're
back to your old self.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.737
[snorting]
