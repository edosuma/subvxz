- Hmm.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.713
How did what I say yesterday
result in this?

14:49.788 --> 14:51.722
It meets all your criteria.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.725
It's personal because I personally know
what a bug she has up her ass...

14:54.793 --> 14:56.727
about how much
we screwed up her car.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.594
<i>It's thoughtful because I had to
go to the junkyard and get it.</i>

14:59.665 --> 15:02.532
And it's something she would never
get herself for the obvious reason...

15:02.601 --> 15:05.400
that her bumper's been hanging
from a string for the past half year.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.576
Okay, Michael,
this is what I'm gonna do.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.579
I am going to take the Christmas dog show
off my calendar...

15:14.647 --> 15:17.776
and take you shopping
and rectify this situation.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.911
<i>I'm not gonna get obsessed
over this present. This is fine.</i>

15:20.986 --> 15:23.921
- I'm not gonna make everyone around
me miserable. - What are you saying?

15:23.989 --> 15:27.186
- That I get obsessed and make everyone
around me miserable? - I didn't say that.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.092
You know, is it too much to ask...

15:30.162 --> 15:33.363
that one day a year I can be like
a normal human being with a normal life...

15:33.364 --> 15:34.297
that one day a year I can be like
a normal human being with a normal life...

15:34.365 --> 15:36.060

15:36.133 --> 15:39.068
<i>No, mein fuhrer.</i>

15:39.136 --> 15:41.127

15:42.106 --> 15:43.596

15:55.018 --> 15:58.283
Oh, is it all right if I leave some gifts here?
I have more shopping to do.

15:58.355 --> 16:01.916
- Leave 'em on the table.
- Bye-bye, then.

16:06.063 --> 16:08.054
Whew.

16:08.132 --> 16:12.626
Meaty-Man, in case the game runs late on
Sunday, we don't make it to the Crashdown.

Maria has told me so much about you.

- Oh, no! Come on!

16:40.497 --> 16:42.932
This is what Christmas is all about.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.935
Opening your heart
and creating new family.

16:46.003 --> 16:47.801
It's just a temporary thing.

16:47.871 --> 16:50.306

17:53.504 --> 17:55.438
Liz, I've made up my mind.

17:55.506 --> 17:58.441
- I'm gonna be there for Brody and Sydney.
- Yes, definitely.

17:58.509 --> 18:01.376
We could put together a care package
from the Crashdown...

18:01.445 --> 18:04.380
so they don't have to worry
about making food.

18:04.448 --> 18:06.678
No, I mean I'm gonna <i>be</i> with them.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.684
What are you talking about?

18:08.752 --> 18:11.687
Brody is such a good man.
He reallyis.

18:11.755 --> 18:15.123
And Sydney, we only spoke for a minute,
but we had this immediate connection.

18:15.192 --> 18:18.218
- A girl needs a mother--
- No, Maria. Slow down.

18:18.295 --> 18:21.731
No, I can't take it anymore.
lt'sjust so sad. I have to do something.

18:21.798 --> 18:26.065
Maria, you're 17.
You're in high school. Brody... is not.

18:26.136 --> 18:28.571
My mother was married
when she was 17.

18:28.639 --> 18:33.008
Okay, no, it's not exactly an advertisement
for marrying young, but-

18:33.076 --> 18:36.137
Maria, you can't just step in
and become someone's mother.

18:36.213 --> 18:39.205
And what, all of a sudden
you'rejust gonna be with Brody?

18:40.951 --> 18:44.148
Did Brody say something to you?

18:44.221 --> 18:47.418
Did you talk to him about this?

18:48.559 --> 18:50.220
I mean-
[Sighs]

18:50.294 --> 18:52.991
What is making you think this?

18:56.767 --> 18:58.826
He said he liked my voice.

19:00.304 --> 19:03.672
Oh, my God.
What am I thinking?

19:03.740 --> 19:06.471
I'm gonna marry Brody?
I mean, I'm crazy!

19:06.543 --> 19:09.478
No, you're not crazy.
It is- [ Laughs]

19:09.546 --> 19:12.481
It's just killing you
not to do something about this...

19:12.549 --> 19:16.577
because you are
such a good person.

19:16.653 --> 19:20.385
But I think the best thing
you could do is just...

19:21.692 --> 19:23.683
leave them alone.

19:24.828 --> 19:27.024
<i>Their time is precious right now.</i>

19:27.097 --> 19:30.032
You should let them
have their time together.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.797
I mean, it's so wrong.

19:32.869 --> 19:34.803

Others may know me as the president
of the hunger drive.

20:07.471 --> 20:10.998
And still others might know me from
the many holiday events at the nursing home.

20:11.074 --> 20:13.099

Look, I know what
I'm asking here is- is big.

21:36.727 --> 21:39.788
There are a million reasons not to do this,
and only one reason to do it.

21:42.199 --> 21:43.963

21:47.170 --> 21:49.764
I don't know what else to say.

What we've been through this past year...

21:52.843 --> 21:54.777

You made your decision before you walked
through that door. I could hear it in your voice.

I looked in the garage,
but I couldn't find any.

22:55.138 --> 22:58.039
- That's 'cause there aren't any.
- What do you mean?

22:58.108 --> 23:01.840
Uh, we don't have any other chairs.

23:01.912 --> 23:04.609
All we have are, uh, two chairs?

23:04.681 --> 23:08.777
Um, doesn't that seem
a little odd to you?

23:08.852 --> 23:12.982
We used to have more chairs,
but over the years our collection has dwindled.
