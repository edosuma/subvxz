00:01.769 --> 00:03.304
NARRATOR:
Oak Island,

00:03.337 --> 00:05.273
Nova Scotia, Canada.

00:05.306 --> 00:09.110
October 16, 2017.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.811
Let's see
if we can find something.

00:10.844 --> 00:14.182
Treasure hunters
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

00:14.215 --> 00:16.484
are searching the area on the
northeast corner of the island

00:16.517 --> 00:19.420
known as Smith's Cove.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.191
That sounds good.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.326
Yeah. Yeah,
that's worth digging.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.261
It's a good depth.
It's saying ten inches.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.833
GARY:
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.536
-whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't see anything.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.471
GARY:
I see something.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.077
Oh, my gosh!

00:43.111 --> 00:44.478
-RICK: That's a cross.
-That's a cross.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.581
That is an old, old cross--
I would say

00:47.615 --> 00:51.685
that is somewhere
in between 1200 and 1600.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.488
A centuries-old cross

00:54.522 --> 00:57.691
on a remote island
in Nova Scotia?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.294
How did this
mysterious artifact

01:00.328 --> 01:03.464
come to be in the sands
of Smith's Cove?

01:03.497 --> 01:06.200
The answer
may not only provide a clue

01:06.234 --> 01:09.337
as to what lies buried
on Oak Island,

01:09.370 --> 01:11.405
but could also
bring into question

01:11.439 --> 01:14.275
the very history
of North America,

01:14.308 --> 01:18.612
because, incredibly,
it is identical to a cross

01:18.646 --> 01:23.817
found on the wall of a
700-year-old prison in France.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.554
Could this cross be
physical evidence

01:26.587 --> 01:29.590
that the treasures of the
Knights Templar are buried...

01:29.623 --> 01:32.326
on Oak Island?

01:33.527 --> 01:36.130
*

01:40.901 --> 01:44.405
NARRATOR:
For more than 223 years,

01:44.438 --> 01:46.574
Oak Island has been the site

01:46.607 --> 01:50.411
of what is perhaps history's
greatest treasure hunt.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.747
But to this day, what lies
hidden beneath the surface

01:53.781 --> 01:56.217
remains a mystery.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.520
Theories range
from pirate treasure...

01:59.553 --> 02:02.190
to the lost crown jewels
of Marie Antoinette...

02:02.223 --> 02:06.660
to the lost manuscripts
of William Shakespeare.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.897
But for Rick Lagina--
one of the driving forces

02:09.930 --> 02:12.466
behind the current excavations
on Oak Island--

02:12.500 --> 02:15.336
one theory is more compelling
than all the rest.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.705
RICK:
There's this possibility

02:17.738 --> 02:19.473
that Templars are associated
in some way

02:19.507 --> 02:20.874
with the workings
on Oak Island.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.944
The Templars were enigmatic

02:23.977 --> 02:25.746
and powerful and influential,
and for them

02:25.779 --> 02:27.481
-to just disappear...

02:27.515 --> 02:30.251
...I think that story
is quite magical.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.685
*

02:31.719 --> 02:33.787
Could it be that

02:33.821 --> 02:35.756
the Oak Island story
has ramifications

02:35.789 --> 02:37.491
halfway across the globe?

02:40.294 --> 02:43.597
NARRATOR:
Jerusalem, 1095 AD.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.634
The city is the epicenter

02:46.667 --> 02:49.637
of the struggle
for the Holy Land.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.906
-Muslim armies from Palestine

02:52.940 --> 02:55.209
and Egypt have ruled
the walled enclave

02:55.243 --> 02:57.911
for more than four centuries,

02:57.945 --> 02:59.747
slaughtering
Christian supporters

02:59.780 --> 03:03.584
of the Holy Roman
and Byzantine Empires.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.856
*

03:13.294 --> 03:14.895
Jerusalem is important

03:14.928 --> 03:17.298
for at least three
different religious traditions.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.800
So, it starts off, of course,

03:19.833 --> 03:23.304
as the capital
for the Jewish tradition.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.606
Then Christianity
comes in the world,

03:25.639 --> 03:28.709
and these are spaces
that are important for Jesus.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.613
For Muslims, it's important
because Muhammad goes there,

03:32.646 --> 03:36.250
from Mecca to Jerusalem, from
Jerusalem ascends up to Heaven.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.519
NARRATOR:
In 1095,

03:38.552 --> 03:42.256
Pope Urban II summons
Christians from across Europe

03:42.290 --> 03:46.427
to join a military expedition
to recapture Jerusalem.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.629
Well-armed Crusaders

03:48.662 --> 03:51.332
take up his challenge,
violently driving out

03:51.365 --> 03:53.634
the Muslims within four years.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.405
The success
of the First Crusade

03:57.438 --> 04:00.641
generates a flood of Christian
pilgrims heading for Jerusalem.

04:00.674 --> 04:04.778
But the journey
is long and dangerous.

04:04.812 --> 04:09.450
In 1118, a well-connected
and influential French knight,

04:09.483 --> 04:12.786
Hugues de Payens,
makes a proposal

04:12.820 --> 04:15.889
to set up a protection system
for Jerusalem-bound pilgrims,

04:15.923 --> 04:18.692
to be based at the very center
of the city,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.728
on Temple Mount.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.863
CLIVE PRINCE:
Hugues de Payens went

04:22.896 --> 04:25.866
to the newly installed
king of Jerusalem

04:25.899 --> 04:28.902
and asked
for his permission to, um...

04:28.936 --> 04:31.271
defend pilgrims.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.708
So the king
gave them permission.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.544
Gave them quarters

04:36.577 --> 04:38.712
in the Al-Aqsa Mosque,

04:38.746 --> 04:42.316
which he was using
as his palace.

04:42.350 --> 04:46.420
So Hugues de Payens gathered
together eight other knights,

04:46.454 --> 04:48.556
and because Temple Mount
was their headquarters,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.991
they called themselves
the Knights Templar.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.527
NARRATOR: Officially known
as the Poor Fellow Knights

04:53.561 --> 04:55.363
of Solomon's Temple,

04:55.396 --> 04:57.765
there were initially
only nine members,

04:57.798 --> 05:00.801
and many believe
their stated purpose

05:00.834 --> 05:04.672
of protecting pilgrims
was simply a cover.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.040
HOLST:
Well, the first thing they did

05:07.074 --> 05:09.677
was to do a survey
of the Mount,

05:09.710 --> 05:12.780
including all the underground
passages that were there.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.748
And it's believed
that they may have found

05:14.782 --> 05:16.950
the Ark of the Covenant.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.786
McGOWAN COPPENS:
The Ark of the Covenant

05:18.819 --> 05:22.122
holds the covenant
from God to man,

05:22.155 --> 05:25.092
and that is physically
the two tablets

05:25.125 --> 05:27.928
representing
the Ten Commandments.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.897
-Moses was given

05:29.930 --> 05:31.832
very specific instructions

05:31.865 --> 05:33.801
on how the ark was
to be constructed,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.836
and he followed them perfectly.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.705
One of the descriptions
that he was given

05:37.738 --> 05:40.140
was that there should be
two angels, called cherubim,

05:40.173 --> 05:43.444
sitting on top of the ark
facing each other.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.547
And it was the space
between these angels

05:46.580 --> 05:49.517
where their wings came together
to cover the ark,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.485
that was the holy space

05:51.519 --> 05:54.354
where the power of God
would manifest.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.658
Certainly, the Templars

05:57.691 --> 06:00.160
would have been after
the Ark of the Covenant,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.796
because it was
the ultimate weapon,

06:02.830 --> 06:06.033
-according
to the Old Testament.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.938
NARRATOR:
Curiously, after ten years,

06:10.971 --> 06:13.741
the Knights Templar's secret
excavations at Temple Mount

06:13.774 --> 06:16.944
suddenly came to a halt.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.113
Is it possible that they found
what they were looking for...

06:20.147 --> 06:22.483
the Ark of the Covenant?

06:22.516 --> 06:24.585
Some researchers suggest

06:24.618 --> 06:26.987
that coming into possession
of the Ark

06:27.020 --> 06:30.891
is what allowed the Templars
to extend their influence,

06:30.924 --> 06:35.028
and begin to recruit new
members from all across Europe.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.098
I often think of them
as, like, uh...

06:38.131 --> 06:40.501
American Green Berets,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.903
who will take, like,
a few guys,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.539
will go into a foreign land

06:45.573 --> 06:47.941
and make contacts with people

06:47.975 --> 06:49.877
of other languages
and cultures,

06:49.910 --> 06:53.113
and kind of train
and recruit them.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.516
NARRATOR:
With their ranks swelling

06:55.549 --> 06:59.186
to more than 5,000 knights
between 1118 and 1307,

06:59.219 --> 07:03.691
the Templars soon found
that protecting pilgrims

07:03.724 --> 07:05.559
on the road to Jerusalem
could be more

07:05.593 --> 07:08.095
than just a spiritual calling--

07:08.128 --> 07:09.997
it was also a chance

07:10.030 --> 07:14.101
to substantially increase
their wealth and power.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.504
Travelers throughout Europe

07:16.537 --> 07:18.606
needed more
than a physical police force

07:18.639 --> 07:21.008
to keep their property safe,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.677
so the Knights Templar
came up with a system

07:23.711 --> 07:25.779
that is recognized
by historians

07:25.813 --> 07:29.583
as the world's first bank.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.118
This is in the pre-modern world,

07:31.151 --> 07:33.053
where you're traveling
with your possessions.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.055
You don't have a credit card--
you're carrying the cash

07:35.088 --> 07:37.257
that you'll need
for a six-month trip.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.460
That makes a very appealing
target for robbers.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.764
The Knights Templar
worked out a system

07:43.797 --> 07:47.100
that they could deposit
their money in their home city,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.837
go to Jerusalem
with a letter of credit,

07:49.870 --> 07:52.540
which was an invention
of the Knights Templar,

07:52.573 --> 07:55.008
and present this
and receive their money

07:55.042 --> 07:58.278
so that the highwaymen
were not able to get it.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.847
But...

07:59.880 --> 08:02.650
there was a nice subtext,
which was...

08:02.683 --> 08:05.919
that if you died en route,
and an awful lot of people did,

08:05.953 --> 08:08.055
then the Templars
could take all your money.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.857
And they did.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.192
WHITEHEAD:
The Knights Templar of old

08:12.225 --> 08:14.928
were given border access
to different countries

08:14.962 --> 08:16.797
by the Pope.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.133
And also, Pope Innocent III
gave them tax exemption,

08:20.167 --> 08:22.302
which is a very
interesting thing as well.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.605
YOUNG: This was
something like a precursor

08:24.638 --> 08:27.074
to a multinational corporation,

08:27.107 --> 08:30.611
a very powerful enterprise.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.780
And the story is well known
that they had lent

08:32.813 --> 08:35.248
an enormous amount of money
to the king of France.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.184
*

08:37.217 --> 08:39.286
NARRATOR: Having the king
of France in their debt

08:39.319 --> 08:42.956
put the Templars in a position
of incredible power,

08:42.990 --> 08:46.627
but also extraordinary danger.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.097
King Philip IV was left
with two choices--

08:50.130 --> 08:51.765
pay them...

08:51.799 --> 08:53.300
or destroy them.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.605
To get out of paying back
the Order,

08:57.638 --> 09:00.608
the king of France decides
they are Satanists

09:00.641 --> 09:04.344
and they're defiling the church
and gets them drummed out.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.313
HOLST: The king of France
then leaned on the Pope

09:06.346 --> 09:08.215
to back him up
and press charges

09:08.248 --> 09:10.718
against the Knights Templar.

09:10.751 --> 09:14.221
The Grand Master reported
to the Pope and to no one else.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.857
And here the Pope was siding

09:16.890 --> 09:18.959
with the king of France,
turning all of his people over

09:18.992 --> 09:21.028
to be imprisoned
and burned at the stake,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.130
and they felt horribly betrayed.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.934
-NARRATOR: In October of 1307,

09:26.967 --> 09:29.703
on Friday 13,

09:29.737 --> 09:33.073
King Philip IV arrested
the Grand Master

09:33.106 --> 09:36.109
of the Knights Templar,
Jacques de Molay.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.813
He was tortured
for seven long years.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.816
But why?
Among the charges

09:42.850 --> 09:46.654
brought against the Templars
was worship of a heathen idol,

09:46.687 --> 09:51.191
an idol that some believe was
the Ark of the Covenant.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.360
Was King Philip attempting
to discover

09:53.393 --> 09:55.729
where the Knights Templar
had hidden it?

09:55.763 --> 09:58.899
In the end,
the Grand Master refused

09:58.932 --> 10:01.368
to reveal any Templar secrets,

10:01.401 --> 10:04.371
and on March 18, 1314,

10:04.404 --> 10:07.074
he was burned at the stake.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.843
McGOWAN COPPENS:
As Jacques de Molay stood

10:09.877 --> 10:13.280
at the funeral pyre waiting
for the flames to consume him,

10:13.313 --> 10:17.384
he cursed the king
and he cursed the Pope.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.087
And he said that both of them
would be called before God

10:20.120 --> 10:22.856
before the end
of a year and a day.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.192
Within a year,

10:25.225 --> 10:28.962
the Pope dies
of a prolonged illness.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.932
Within a year,
the king dies of a stroke

10:31.965 --> 10:34.401
on his way to go hunting.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.737
But it doesn't end there.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.873
Over the course
of the next 14 years,

10:39.907 --> 10:44.444
the king of France's line, his
three sons and his grandson,

10:44.477 --> 10:48.248
all die in somewhat
mysterious circumstances,

10:48.281 --> 10:51.852
and this destroys
the Capetian Dynasty.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.855
NARRATOR:
Arrested, convicted of heresy,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.990
tortured and executed--

10:57.024 --> 11:00.694
is this the end
of the Knights Templar?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.736
NARRATOR:
France, 1307.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.404
Upon the orders
of King Philip IV,

11:11.438 --> 11:13.807
members of the Knights Templar,

11:13.841 --> 11:16.143
who were once
among the most powerful

11:16.176 --> 11:18.245
and highly regarded men
in the world,

11:18.278 --> 11:20.313
are persecuted,

11:20.347 --> 11:24.885
hunted down, and imprisoned
throughout the country.

11:24.918 --> 11:28.488
Those who are caught
are subjected to interrogation

11:28.521 --> 11:30.223
-and torture...

11:30.257 --> 11:31.725
and often executed.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.735
One prison, where
at least 70 Templars were held,

11:41.769 --> 11:44.738
still stands today in
the fortified medieval village

11:44.772 --> 11:46.874
of Domme, France.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.345
Fearing that they may be
the last of their order,

11:52.379 --> 11:56.216
the Templar prisoners sought
to preserve their legacy

11:56.249 --> 11:57.985
by carving symbols
and coded messages

11:58.018 --> 11:59.386
into the solid rock walls

11:59.419 --> 12:02.255
using whatever was available--

12:02.289 --> 12:05.893
sometimes even their own teeth.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.096
JERRY GLOVER:
It was long thought,

12:09.129 --> 12:11.899
for hundreds of years, that
there were no written records

12:11.932 --> 12:14.001
pertaining
to the Knights Templar.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.436
Their archive in Paris
was destroyed.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.406
But there are some traces
of Templar writings

12:19.439 --> 12:21.508
in the form of graffiti.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.877
And there are
extensive examples of those

12:23.911 --> 12:25.946
in the guardhouse at Domme.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.015
Come in.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.350
NARRATOR:
In September 2017,

12:30.383 --> 12:32.519
-Wow. -Rick Lagina
and two of his nephews

12:32.552 --> 12:36.023
traveled to the 700-year-old
prison in Domme

12:36.056 --> 12:38.091
in search of further clues

12:38.125 --> 12:42.062
as to what treasures
might lie hidden on Oak Island.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.365
GLOVER:
And you can see lots of evidence

12:45.398 --> 12:47.367
of how they passed
their time, which was

12:47.400 --> 12:51.504
by making carvings in the walls
to sustain them spiritually.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.240
Over here is

12:53.273 --> 12:56.376
some of the most well-known
carvings at Domme.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.345
This way.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.883
NARRATOR: But of all
the carvings in Domme,

13:02.916 --> 13:05.452
there was one
that caught Rick's attention

13:05.485 --> 13:07.087
more than any other.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.089
And it was this same carving

13:09.122 --> 13:12.225
that he believed
provided a match

13:12.259 --> 13:14.161
with the mysterious lead cross

13:14.194 --> 13:16.496
he found at Smith's Cove
just one week later.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.332
GARY:
That is an old, old cross.

13:19.366 --> 13:24.404
I would say that is somewhere
in between 1200 and 1600.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.374
But if the cross
at Smith's Cove

13:27.407 --> 13:29.476
is determined to be
of Templar origin,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
how would it have made its way

13:31.544 --> 13:36.283
some 3,000 miles
across the Atlantic?

13:36.316 --> 13:41.321
Is it possible that, during the
period of their persecution,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.991
some of the Templars
actually escaped

13:44.024 --> 13:47.560
and, if so, may have made
their way to North America?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.462
HOLST:
Of the roughly 4,000

13:49.496 --> 13:52.365
Knights Templar
that existed at that time,

13:52.399 --> 13:54.567
a total of about 500

13:54.601 --> 13:57.604
have ever been arrested or
put on trial at any given time.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.907
That left 3,500

13:59.940 --> 14:02.275
Knights Templar
who had to be accounted for.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.347
NARRATOR:
It was rumored

14:07.380 --> 14:10.517
that the Templars had
a fleet of 18 ships

14:10.550 --> 14:14.587
based at La Rochelle on
the Atlantic coast of France...

14:14.621 --> 14:18.892
which King Philip
set out to capture.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.427
His troops immediately went
to La Rochelle

14:20.460 --> 14:23.196
to arrest the Templar fleet.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.300
They got there,
and there were no ships.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.669
The whole Templar fleet
had disappeared.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.005
Where would it have gone?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.676
NARRATOR: It is widely believed
that the Templar fleet

14:36.709 --> 14:38.979
sailed north to a country

14:39.012 --> 14:40.513
where they already had
a stronghold

14:40.547 --> 14:42.282
and many supporters--

14:42.315 --> 14:43.516
Scotland.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.318
YOUNG:
The king,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.021
Robert the Bruce,
was in trouble with the Pope.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.923
He was already excommunicated.

14:49.957 --> 14:53.693
This made Scotland
something of an open place.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.530
And this became
a very attractive mecca

14:57.564 --> 14:59.933
for the Knights Templars
after the troubles.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.305
McGOWAN COPPENS: The Templars
had made arrangements

15:05.338 --> 15:06.573
for this inevitability.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.041
They had sent money.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.309
They had sent treasure.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.944
They had sent documents

15:10.978 --> 15:13.080
to places that
they knew would be safe.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.449
NARRATOR:
Some researchers believe

15:16.483 --> 15:19.987
that for decades the fugitive
knights were protected

15:20.020 --> 15:22.189
by one of Scotland's
most powerful families,

15:22.222 --> 15:24.591
under the guidance
of their patriarch,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.559
Henry Sinclair.

15:26.593 --> 15:30.397
KNIGHT: Henry Sinclair was
the jarl of Orkney.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.600
He was from the, uh,
the family, the Sinclairs,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.502
originally Santa Claris,

15:35.535 --> 15:38.338
which became
the Sinclair clan of today.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.475
NARRATOR:
According to Christopher Knight

15:42.509 --> 15:44.511
and other Templar researchers,

15:44.544 --> 15:47.047
Henry's ancestors--
the Sinclairs--

15:47.080 --> 15:50.117
and their French relatives--
the St. Clairs--

15:50.150 --> 15:53.553
were instrumental in creating
the Knights Templar.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.355
McGOWAN COPPENS:
Henry Sinclair

15:55.388 --> 15:57.324
was clearly a Templar

15:57.357 --> 15:59.726
or a descendant
of the Knights Templar.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.030
NARRATOR:
But although Scotland provided

16:03.063 --> 16:06.033
a temporary safe haven,
the Knights Templar

16:06.066 --> 16:08.435
were still being hunted
by the Pope,

16:08.468 --> 16:11.771
and wanted to create
a homeland of their own.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.041
*

16:14.074 --> 16:16.476
To that end,
they sought a destination

16:16.509 --> 16:19.079
where they could build
a New Jerusalem.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.215
Although evidence
that the Templars succeeded

16:22.249 --> 16:24.684
is unsubstantiated,
there are many who believe

16:24.717 --> 16:27.654
they were made aware
of a vast new world

16:27.687 --> 16:30.223
some 3,000 miles to the west.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.762
There are records from the
Irish, records from the Vikings.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.697
There are indications
that the Phoenicians

16:37.730 --> 16:39.499
came in this direction.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.802
There is so much evidence now
that Europeans

16:42.835 --> 16:46.473
were coming in this direction,
heading towards this New World

16:46.506 --> 16:48.775
hundreds of years
before Columbus,

16:48.808 --> 16:50.810
hundreds of years
before official history

16:50.843 --> 16:54.047
actually recognizes it.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.649
There was this kind of secret
knowledge of another continent,

16:56.683 --> 16:59.219
which therefore
could have reached the Templars.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.589
NARRATOR:
According to letters

17:02.622 --> 17:05.658
discovered in the 16th century,

17:05.692 --> 17:08.761
Prince Henry Sinclair hired two
experienced sailors from Italy,

17:08.795 --> 17:11.564
Antonio and Nicolo Zeno,

17:11.598 --> 17:13.633
to guide a daring
3000-mile expedition

17:13.666 --> 17:15.568
from Orkney, Scotland

17:15.602 --> 17:17.637
in 1398.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.076
DICK EASTMAN: The documentation
they kept actually was...

17:23.110 --> 17:24.744
given back
to one of their relatives

17:24.777 --> 17:27.080
and remained hidden
for about 200 years,

17:27.114 --> 17:30.483
was found, and then
has since been transcribed.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.155
NARRATOR: While the authenticity
of the Zeno narratives

17:35.188 --> 17:39.292
remains unsubstantiated,
they report that Henry Sinclair

17:39.326 --> 17:41.494
rented 12 Venetian ships

17:41.528 --> 17:44.764
and filled them
with Templar fugitives.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.234
After leaving Orkney,
they sailed west,

17:47.267 --> 17:49.436
toward North America.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.638
McGOWAN COPPENS:
If you trace their journey

17:51.671 --> 17:54.141
from Scotland
down through Iceland,

17:54.174 --> 17:56.576
it makes so much sense
that they followed

17:56.609 --> 17:59.479
this trajectory
and ended up in Nova Scotia.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.620
NARRATOR: Nova Scotia--
Latin for New Scotland--

18:07.654 --> 18:10.290
would have offered
Henry Sinclair a perfect home

18:10.323 --> 18:13.293
for himself
and his fellow knights.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.163
Here he made contact
with the native people

18:16.196 --> 18:19.766
known as the Mi'kmaq,
also pronounced as Mi'kmaw.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.202
Backing up the Zeno narrative

18:22.235 --> 18:26.406
are the stories passed down
by the Mi'kmaq themselves.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.608
We're Mi'kmaq
on my mother's side,

18:28.641 --> 18:32.312
and she started talking about
that when I was very young,

18:32.345 --> 18:34.681
you know, four years old,
five years old.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.150
I, for one, really do believe
that Henry Sinclair

18:37.184 --> 18:39.552
did come to Cape Breton.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.455
MARTY: It fits with the Templar
theory itself really well.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.757
You know, if, really,
if Henry Sinclair

18:44.791 --> 18:47.560
was really here, and he... he
clearly would have to interact

18:47.594 --> 18:49.462
with the First Nations peoples.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.364
He would have to;
they lived here.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.300
It's intriguing.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.737
NARRATOR:
But if the Templars

18:57.770 --> 19:00.440
really landed on the shores
of Nova Scotia,

19:00.473 --> 19:03.276
did they bring
their treasures with them?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.447
And if so, where are they now?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.655
NARRATOR: According to legend,
Scottish prince Henry Sinclair

19:15.688 --> 19:17.657
and his armada of ships

19:17.690 --> 19:22.295
reached the area now known
as Nova Scotia in 1398.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.798
Some researchers suggest
that Sinclair learned

19:25.832 --> 19:28.401
there was land
3,000 miles to the west

19:28.435 --> 19:30.637
through the stories
of the Vikings,

19:30.670 --> 19:34.741
who had, by some accounts,
reached America even earlier.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.944
But others believe

19:37.977 --> 19:40.747
he had a more direct source
of information...

19:40.780 --> 19:43.283
the Knights Templar themselves,

19:43.316 --> 19:45.885
who may have made their
first trip to the New World

19:45.918 --> 19:50.623
220 years earlier in 1178.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.395
In 2016,

19:55.428 --> 19:57.930
Oak Island treasure hunter
Rick Lagina

19:57.964 --> 20:01.334
and researcher Doug Crowell
met with Templar historian

20:01.368 --> 20:02.602
Zena Halpern.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.537
A former member

20:04.571 --> 20:07.240
of the New England Antiquities
Research Association,

20:07.274 --> 20:09.576
Zena has devoted
much of the past decade

20:09.609 --> 20:12.011
to researching
possible evidence

20:12.044 --> 20:15.515
of Knights Templar activity
in North America.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.650
It was during the course
of this research

20:17.684 --> 20:19.719
that she acquired copies

20:19.752 --> 20:22.989
of what she believes
to be ancient maps,

20:23.022 --> 20:25.292
the originals of which
were found buried

20:25.325 --> 20:28.295
in the pages of an old book.

20:28.328 --> 20:32.265
ZENA: These maps are part
of the Templar document.

20:32.299 --> 20:36.469
The main part of the book
that I've written

20:36.503 --> 20:40.807
covers a 12th century
Templar voyage,

20:40.840 --> 20:45.445
identified from 1178 to 1180,

20:45.478 --> 20:49.582
of a Templar leader
by the name of Ralph de Sudeley.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.952
NARRATOR:
According to historians,

20:52.985 --> 20:55.922
Ralph de Sudeley was
a wealthy English baron

20:55.955 --> 21:00.727
who fought alongside the
Templars during the Crusades.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.564
Zena Halpern believes
that the maps provide evidence

21:04.597 --> 21:07.934
that not only did
de Sudeley reach Nova Scotia,

21:07.967 --> 21:10.970
but that he buried all or part
of the priceless artifacts

21:11.003 --> 21:13.973
he acquired on Oak Island.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.075
I think the purpose
of de Sudeley's journey

21:16.108 --> 21:18.611
was to explore the new area,

21:18.645 --> 21:21.548
but also to possibly hide
holy artifacts.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.589
NARRATOR: Shortly before meeting
with Zena Halpern in 2016,

21:29.622 --> 21:33.660
Rick Lagina had traveled
with researchers Doug Crowell

21:33.693 --> 21:37.464
and Charles Barkhouse
to the village of New Ross,

21:37.497 --> 21:40.533
just 20 miles north
of Oak Island.

21:40.567 --> 21:44.036
They had been invited
by local property owners

21:44.070 --> 21:47.674
Alessandra Nadudvari
and her husband Tim Loncarich

21:47.707 --> 21:50.743
to come and visit what
they believe to be evidence

21:50.777 --> 21:53.346
of ancient Templar structures.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.415
And if you like,
I'll show you what we've got.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.550
CHARLES:
Lead on.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.553
TIM: In the 1970s,
one of the previous owners

22:00.587 --> 22:03.556
was digging in the backyard here
for a garden,

22:03.590 --> 22:05.091
and when she got down
a couple of feet,

22:05.124 --> 22:08.528
she started uncovering
old foundation stones.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.900
This is one of the stones
that she uncovered.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.735
She called it the Herm Stone,

22:15.768 --> 22:18.905
and she felt that it could be
a grave marker.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.409
And then, if you look more
closely on the face,

22:22.442 --> 22:24.944
it looks like there could be
something carved on the face.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.813
It's very worn,

22:26.846 --> 22:29.649
as it would be if it was
700 or 800 years old.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.419
ALESSANDRA:
I think that,

22:32.452 --> 22:33.820
on the face of the stone,

22:33.853 --> 22:37.056
you can see a very faint outline
of a cross.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.092
In my opinion, what it looks
like, it's a Christian cross,

22:40.126 --> 22:44.497
and no ordinary cross, but the
cross of the Knights Templar.

22:46.999 --> 22:51.604
NARRATOR: The area is now
overgrown by trees and foliage,

22:51.638 --> 22:55.174
but excavations by the site's
previous landowners revealed

22:55.207 --> 22:58.144
what appeared to be
an ancient foundation,

22:58.177 --> 23:02.615
possibly built
as a Templar fortress.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.451
A far

23:04.484 --> 23:06.152
Perhaps.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.888
But there are many
who believe New Ross

23:08.921 --> 23:11.991
was only one of many areas
in Nova Scotia

23:12.024 --> 23:15.027
where the Templars left behind
evidence of their activity

23:15.061 --> 23:16.963
in the New World.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.998
The Templars had interest
in mining.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.067
And we know

23:21.100 --> 23:25.037
that there is a gold-producing
area in the Nova Scotia region.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.706
It has been conjectured

23:26.739 --> 23:29.909
that Templars went there
to mine gold.

23:29.942 --> 23:33.546
It's also been conjectured
that Templars mined silver

23:33.580 --> 23:36.483
further afield
in North America.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.854
NARRATOR:
In 2015,

23:41.888 --> 23:44.757
amateur archaeologist
Terry Deveau invited

23:44.791 --> 23:46.759
Rick and Marty Lagina,

23:46.793 --> 23:49.496
along with members
of their Oak Island team,

23:49.529 --> 23:54.033
to a remote field some 130
miles southwest of New Ross,

23:54.066 --> 23:56.536
near the Bay of Fundy.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.037
So is it this way?

23:58.070 --> 23:59.806
-Pretty much.
-Okay, great, perfect.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.675
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.544
NARRATOR: Terry was eager
to show the Laginas

24:04.577 --> 24:06.078
the Overton Stone,

24:06.112 --> 24:09.115
a large stone that sits
overlooking the bay

24:09.148 --> 24:13.185
and on which are carved
a number of mysterious images.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.255
The rock here
is probably located

24:16.288 --> 24:19.659
on the highest point
in quite a distance around.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.996
So now you can see the carving
quite clearly here.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.532
It's very beautiful.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.936
It has the eagle feather,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.538
and behind the eagle feather,

24:31.571 --> 24:33.139
there are a pair
of tobacco leaves.

24:33.172 --> 24:37.777
There you have two
of the most important symbols

24:37.810 --> 24:40.613
in the Mi'kmaw belief system.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.583
The hypothesis
that I'm suggesting

24:43.616 --> 24:46.753
is that this whole carving
was made by a European

24:46.786 --> 24:48.888
to commemorate, perhaps,

24:48.921 --> 24:52.792
a friendship treaty
between Europeans and Mi'kmaw.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.928
That is quite remarkable,
and isn't that a Templar cross?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.833
NARRATOR:
A Templar cross?

25:00.867 --> 25:04.704
And a carving which suggests
a treaty between Europeans

25:04.737 --> 25:07.206
and the indigenous peoples
of Nova Scotia?

25:07.239 --> 25:11.644
They could've been teaching each
other these esoteric beliefs,

25:11.678 --> 25:13.312
and in fact,

25:13.345 --> 25:15.314
all these stories
of Christianity and Jesus

25:15.347 --> 25:20.152
really are part of Mi'kmaq
belief, surprisingly enough.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.155
NARRATOR:
According to Mi'kmaq legend,

25:23.189 --> 25:25.224
the Mi'kmaq people did,
in fact,

25:25.257 --> 25:27.126
have knowledge of Europeans

25:27.159 --> 25:32.198
long before Columbus reached
the New World in 1492.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.767
They also openly recognize

25:34.801 --> 25:37.604
that one of the Europeans
they formed a friendship with

25:37.637 --> 25:39.572
was Henry Sinclair,

25:39.606 --> 25:42.041
whom many believe
was the inspiration

25:42.074 --> 25:44.677
for the god known as Glooscap.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.680
DOUG: Glooscap was said
to be an explorer,

25:47.714 --> 25:50.249
which Henry Sinclair
certainly was.

25:50.282 --> 25:53.285
Glooscap was said to have
daughters.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.755
Henry Sinclair did.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.824
Glooscap may have
certain aspects

25:57.857 --> 25:59.959
that are larger than life.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.762
A matter of fact, there's one
story where Glooscap arrives

26:02.795 --> 26:04.697
on a ship from the east,

26:04.731 --> 26:08.234
bringing many gifts
and advanced knowledge.

26:08.267 --> 26:12.271
So that really has to be,
I think, Sinclair.

26:12.304 --> 26:16.976
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Mi'kmaq god Glooscap

26:17.009 --> 26:20.046
and Henry Sinclair
were really one and the same?

26:20.079 --> 26:24.784
Perhaps the proof is actually
hiding in plain sight,

26:24.817 --> 26:27.319
in the form
of the Mi'kmaq flag.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.322
PRITCHARD: This is the
ceremonial flag of the Mi'kmaq.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.159
And it's the reverse
of the Templar battle flag,

26:33.192 --> 26:35.828
which has the star below
and the moon above.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.264
And otherwise,
they're absolutely identical.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.267
And that is kind of
why we think, perhaps,

26:41.300 --> 26:44.270
all these connections with
the Templars in Nova Scotia

26:44.303 --> 26:47.139
could be very significant.

26:47.173 --> 26:51.277
If the Templars were carrying
this extraordinary treasure

26:51.310 --> 26:53.379
to a place where they wanted
to be safe

26:53.412 --> 26:57.216
and create a New Jerusalem,
this makes sense.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.418
I do believe that the Templars
were on Oak Island.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.788
And I do believe

27:01.821 --> 27:04.156
that they brought something
very extraordinary with them.

27:10.329 --> 27:14.033
NARRATOR:
For 223 years,

27:14.066 --> 27:18.070
a maze of shafts, tunnels and
booby traps have frustrated

27:18.104 --> 27:19.839
any attempt by treasure hunters

27:19.872 --> 27:23.375
to solve
the Oak Island mystery.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.679
But given the engineering
expertise involved

27:26.713 --> 27:28.347
in the design and construction

27:28.380 --> 27:31.050
of such a complex
defense system,

27:31.083 --> 27:35.454
could this feat really be the
work of the Knights Templar?

27:35.487 --> 27:39.692
PRITCHARD: When you're thinking
about the Sinclairs coming over

27:39.726 --> 27:42.094
and digging a big pit
such as Oak Island,

27:42.128 --> 27:44.797
they needed hundreds of workers.

27:44.831 --> 27:50.036
They, assuredly,
took Mi'kmaqs as employees

27:50.069 --> 27:53.305
to dig the holes
and do all this work.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.475
I do believe that
that was a Templar project,

27:56.508 --> 27:59.245
and I do believe
it had to involve Mi'kmaqs.

27:59.278 --> 28:02.281
NARRATOR: Another
of the engineering feats

28:02.314 --> 28:04.216
that have been found
at Oak Island

28:04.250 --> 28:06.753
is the elaborate system
of box drains

28:06.786 --> 28:11.423
first discovered
at Smith's Cove in 1850.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.293
By using a sophisticated
filtration system

28:14.326 --> 28:18.164
made of a combination
of eelgrass and coconut fibers,

28:18.197 --> 28:21.033
the box drains provided
the water used

28:21.067 --> 28:23.069
to booby trap
the Money Pit area

28:23.102 --> 28:26.338
and thwart the efforts
of would-be treasure hunters.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.174
JACK:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.009
DAN H.: Is that the mother lode
right there?

28:30.042 --> 28:31.778
That looks like it.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.145
JACK:
No way, I think that is.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.981
NARRATOR:
Evidence of coconut fiber,

28:35.014 --> 28:36.816
a substance not native
to North America...

28:36.849 --> 28:38.818
ALEX: This looks
like more right there.

28:38.851 --> 28:43.155
...was found by the Laginas
at Smith's Cove in 2013.

28:46.993 --> 28:50.029
And I would say,
without a word of a doubt,

28:50.062 --> 28:51.363
-that's coconut fiber.
-Yeah. -Oh, yeah.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.099
-Absolutely.
-Yeah, yeah.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.034
Yeah, so we found it.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.069
NARRATOR:
More tests were conducted,

28:57.103 --> 29:00.272
and the results were nothing
less than astounding.

29:00.306 --> 29:04.811
They're dating it
between 1260 and 1400 AD.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.278
-CHARLES: That's what I figured.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.915
So it's old, old, old stuff.

29:08.948 --> 29:12.184
McGOWAN COPPENS: The dating of
these fibers take us directly

29:12.218 --> 29:14.220
to the period when the Templars

29:14.253 --> 29:17.423
would have been escaping
from persecution.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.328
NARRATOR: Ironically,
further evidence connecting

29:22.361 --> 29:26.265
the Templars to Oak Island may
have also recently been found

29:26.298 --> 29:29.368
on the walls of the Domme
prison in France.

29:29.401 --> 29:33.272
So the graffiti at Domme
is not meaningless scratches,

29:33.305 --> 29:35.107
by any means.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.976
The Templars there,
that made that graffiti,

29:37.009 --> 29:39.578
were trying to communicate
something.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.849
NARRATOR: There, next to the
carving that appears similar

29:42.882 --> 29:45.484
to the lead cross found
at Smith's Cove,

29:45.517 --> 29:48.387
is one featuring
a unique configuration

29:48.420 --> 29:51.290
of connecting lines
and crosses.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.126
-Have you seen examples
of that before? -No.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.928
GLOVER:
These don't exist anywhere else,

29:55.962 --> 29:57.529
they only exist here.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.166
It's so unusual,
you have to think of

30:00.199 --> 30:01.968
what other sources
of inspiration

30:02.001 --> 30:04.036
there could have been for this.

30:04.070 --> 30:09.008
And I think it's possibl given
their contacts in the Holy Land,

30:09.041 --> 30:10.609
that this might
have been inspired

30:10.642 --> 30:13.479
by the kabbalistic Tree of Life.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.415
NARRATOR:
The Tree of Life?

30:16.448 --> 30:20.052
As described
in ancient Hebrew texts,

30:20.086 --> 30:22.188
the so-called Tree of Life

30:22.221 --> 30:25.257
lays out ten aributes
that connect the physical self

30:25.291 --> 30:27.259
to the spiritual realm.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.461
It is said
to represent the need

30:29.495 --> 30:32.198
to find a personal path
through life.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.001
In other words,
a map that needs to be followed

30:35.034 --> 30:38.104
in order to find God.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.109
RICK:
Jerry referenced the carving,

30:43.142 --> 30:47.013
which he thought
was a Tree of Life design,

30:47.046 --> 30:49.015
and for me,

30:49.048 --> 30:51.617
I believe we have found
some evidence on the island

30:51.650 --> 30:55.087
that perhaps represents
the Tree of Life.

30:58.390 --> 31:02.228
NARRATOR: In 1981,
treasure hunter Fred Nolan

31:02.261 --> 31:05.131
first discovered
that five large boulders

31:05.164 --> 31:08.600
on his Oak Island property
formed a symmetrical cross

31:08.634 --> 31:14.406
measuring 720 feet wide
by 867 feet long.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.643
At the intersection
of the arms of the cross,

31:17.676 --> 31:20.312
he later unearthed
a sixth boulder,

31:20.346 --> 31:23.615
one that seemed to be carved
to resemble a human face.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.419
Further research

31:27.453 --> 31:29.588
into the unique placement
and configuration

31:29.621 --> 31:31.590
of the boulders
of Nolan's Cross...

31:31.623 --> 31:33.125
-Petter.
-Petter.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.027
...suggests to some researchers

31:35.061 --> 31:38.931
that it may, in fact,
represent the Tree of Life.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.534
This is Nolan's Cross.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.375
I say that this cross
is more than one symbol.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.310
And I will show you why.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.213
If you add a few more points,

31:54.246 --> 31:57.549
like this, between these stones,

31:57.583 --> 31:59.718
there are certain paths.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.487
The geometry indicates

32:01.520 --> 32:04.991
that we are talking
about a Tree of Life.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.594
NARRATOR:
But if Nolan's Cross

32:08.627 --> 32:11.730
can really be proved to depict
the kabbalistic Tree of Life,

32:11.763 --> 32:13.532
why was it constructed?

32:13.565 --> 32:15.434
Was it to celebrate that

32:15.467 --> 32:18.104
the Templars had successfully
found New Jerusalem

32:18.137 --> 32:20.339
in Nova Scotia?

32:20.372 --> 32:23.609
Or was it designed as a clue?

32:23.642 --> 32:25.544
One that offers evidence

32:25.577 --> 32:28.547
that not only did the Templars
come to Oak Island,

32:28.580 --> 32:31.517
but they'd hidden
a vast treasure there.

32:31.550 --> 32:35.587
Perhaps a treasure,
not only of gold and silver,

32:35.621 --> 32:39.625
but one first given to Moses
by God himself.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.634
NARRATOR:
Over the past 223 years,

32:48.667 --> 32:51.070
hundreds of men and women
have been involved

32:51.103 --> 32:54.240
with the search for treasure
on Oak Island.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.476
But although most come
from a variety of backgrounds

32:57.509 --> 33:01.213
and geographic regions,
there is one attribute

33:01.247 --> 33:04.350
that a surprising number
of them have in common:

33:04.383 --> 33:06.018
Freemasonry.

33:09.521 --> 33:12.224
From Daniel McGinnis,
one of the three boys

33:12.258 --> 33:16.362
who first discovered
the Money Pit in 1795,

33:16.395 --> 33:19.331
to William Chappell
and his son M.R.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.467
and even future
American President

33:21.500 --> 33:23.202
Franklin D. Roosevelt,

33:23.235 --> 33:25.771
who joined the search in 1909,

33:25.804 --> 33:28.274
Oak Island has had
a unique relationship

33:28.307 --> 33:30.142
with a society of men

33:30.176 --> 33:33.245
who are qualified
in both structural engineering

33:33.279 --> 33:36.482
and the ability to keep
and protect secrets.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.386
PRINCE:
The level of involvement

33:40.419 --> 33:45.457
of Freemasons in excavations
in Oak Island

33:45.491 --> 33:47.826
is too much to be a coincidence.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.661
All of the early attempts

33:49.695 --> 33:52.731
were all done
by high-ranking Freemasons,

33:52.764 --> 33:54.766
and it's very provable.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.536
Why, is another question.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.373
The obvious answer
is that the Freemasons

34:01.407 --> 34:05.511
know what the Money Pit is,
what's down there,

34:05.544 --> 34:08.547
what it was meant to protect.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.216
NARRATOR:
But why would members

34:10.249 --> 34:12.484
of the Fraternal Order
of Freemasons

34:12.518 --> 34:15.621
know what lies hidden
on Oak Island?

34:15.654 --> 34:17.656
Some researchers say

34:17.689 --> 34:20.426
that it is due to the fact
that, in many ways,

34:20.459 --> 34:22.628
the Freemasons are
the direct descendants

34:22.661 --> 34:24.296
of the Knights Templar,

34:24.330 --> 34:26.698
and as such,
have carried forward

34:26.732 --> 34:29.735
many of the Templars'
ancient rites and traditions.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.375
McGOWAN COPPENS: The transition
of the Knights Templar

34:36.408 --> 34:40.612
into Freemasonry
is an organic evolution.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.848
It's not something
that starts and stops.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.417
There isn't a beginning date
or an end date.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.554
It always existed.
It was always there.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.723
And certainly the Sinclairs
were a huge part of this.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.129
NARRATOR:
Some researchers suggest

34:57.163 --> 34:59.565
that evidence tying
both the Sinclair family

34:59.598 --> 35:02.268
and the Knights Templar
to Freemasonry

35:02.301 --> 35:04.236
can be found by examining

35:04.270 --> 35:07.173
one of the most mysterious
structures in Scotland,

35:07.206 --> 35:09.608
Rosslyn Chapel.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.743
Built in 1446

35:11.777 --> 35:14.880
by Henry Sinclair's
grandson, William,

35:14.913 --> 35:17.616
the ornate building
seems to celebrate

35:17.649 --> 35:21.820
the Knights Templar's
original base on Temple Mount.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.256
PICKNETT:
It was intended,

35:24.290 --> 35:25.891
or so it is believed,

35:25.924 --> 35:29.895
to be the lady chapel
of a much bigger building

35:29.928 --> 35:34.700
that was going to be a copy of
Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.

35:37.336 --> 35:40.606
NARRATOR: When Rick, Marty, and
members of the Oak Island team

35:40.639 --> 35:44.410
visited the ancient church
in 2014,

35:44.443 --> 35:46.578
they encountered
a strange design

35:46.612 --> 35:48.647
on the outside of the building

35:48.680 --> 35:51.950
that may suggest the Templars
transformed themselves

35:51.983 --> 35:55.354
into a new secret society.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.590
The stone carving shows
a blindfolded man

35:58.624 --> 36:01.460
with a rope noose
around his neck,

36:01.493 --> 36:04.896
while a soldier holds the rope.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.400
And this appears to be
the same process

36:08.434 --> 36:10.802
that happens
in a Masonic ritual.

36:10.836 --> 36:14.273
And that's familiar
to every Mason.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.508
This is suggested by many

36:16.542 --> 36:18.644
to be a connection
to Freemasonry,

36:18.677 --> 36:20.279
and it may well have been.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.916
NARRATOR:
But the fraternal society

36:24.950 --> 36:26.852
that became known
as Freemasonry

36:26.885 --> 36:28.820
did not officially exist

36:28.854 --> 36:32.924
until 250 years
after the chapel was built.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.394
Could the strange
initiation ritual

36:35.427 --> 36:37.363
be evidence of a direct lineage

36:37.396 --> 36:39.565
between Templars
and Freemasons?

36:43.335 --> 36:46.872
There are many connections
between the Knights Templar

36:46.905 --> 36:50.876
and Freemasonry,
or the Masonic Lodges.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.679
You're looking at a lot
of the same symbols,

36:53.712 --> 36:55.814
the same rites and rituals.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.716
They wear the white gloves.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.651
They have
the secret handshakes.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.789
NARRATOR:
Central to Freemasonry

37:03.822 --> 37:07.693
was the worship of the
Old Testament patriarch, Enoch,

37:07.726 --> 37:10.028
the great-grandfather of Noah,

37:10.061 --> 37:11.897
who is said to be responsible

37:11.930 --> 37:15.401
for building the First Temple
in Jerusalem.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.437
According to the
ancient Masonic texts

37:18.470 --> 37:20.706
known as "The Legend of Enoch,"

37:20.739 --> 37:23.041
Enoch built a series
of underground chambers

37:23.074 --> 37:25.411
beneath Solomon's Temple,

37:25.444 --> 37:26.945
to guard all
the important knowledge

37:26.978 --> 37:29.281
and treasures of the world.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.420
The first eight levels
provided security.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.722
In the ninth and final chamber,

37:36.755 --> 37:40.559
Enoch placed a triangle of
pure gold surrounded by jewels.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.994
Known as the Enochian Delta,

37:43.028 --> 37:46.598
it was inscribed
with one word: "God."

37:48.700 --> 37:50.402
When the Onslow Company

37:50.436 --> 37:53.339
excavated the Money Pit
in 1804,

37:53.372 --> 37:55.374
workers encountered
nine platforms

37:55.407 --> 37:59.411
constructed from oak beams
at every ten feet.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.513
The ninth and final level

38:01.547 --> 38:05.984
featured a stone slab bearing
mysterious carved symbols.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.923
During their trip
to Scotland in 2014,

38:11.957 --> 38:13.925
Rick and Marty Lagina

38:13.959 --> 38:16.662
met up with Templar researcher
Alan Butler

38:16.695 --> 38:18.397
to get his thoughts
on the parallels

38:18.430 --> 38:21.467
that seem to exist
between Oak Island

38:21.500 --> 38:24.102
and Solomon's Temple.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.771
ALAN BUTLER: When the
Knights Templar were eventually

38:25.804 --> 38:28.607
able to build
their own New Jerusalem,

38:28.640 --> 38:31.943
the Money Pit was deliberately
constructed copy

38:31.977 --> 38:36.348
of Solomon's Temple
and the chambers of Enoch.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.717
NARRATOR:
But if the Templars took pains

38:38.750 --> 38:42.388
to reproduce the vault
of King Solomon on Oak Island,

38:42.421 --> 38:44.456
was it so they could hide
the treasures

38:44.490 --> 38:46.392
that were once hidden there,

38:46.425 --> 38:49.127
chiefly the golden menorah
of King Solomon

38:49.160 --> 38:51.797
and the Ark of the Covenant?

38:53.899 --> 38:55.601
PRITCHARD: People wonder
why was it so important

38:55.634 --> 38:57.836
to build this great pit
at Oak Island.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.838
When you think about
some of the things

38:59.871 --> 39:02.541
that the Templars might have had
in their possession

39:02.574 --> 39:05.377
could arguably include
not only the chalice

39:05.411 --> 39:07.012
that collected Jesus' blood,

39:07.045 --> 39:10.949
but there's a lot of treasures
of the Holy Land

39:10.982 --> 39:12.684
that could have ended up there.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.423
NARRATOR:
Perhaps the ultimate proof

39:17.456 --> 39:19.758
of Templar activity
in the New World

39:19.791 --> 39:21.760
still lies buried,

39:21.793 --> 39:25.130
some 200 feet below the surface
of Oak Island.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.766
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

39:27.799 --> 39:30.702
NARRATOR: Or in the shape
of an ancient cross

39:30.736 --> 39:32.904
recently discovered
at Smith's Cove.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.845
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:43.148 --> 39:45.050
Holy schmoly, all right.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.052
Look at that.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.955
-It's a cross.
-That's a cross. Wash it off.

39:49.988 --> 39:53.091
NARRATOR: With the discovery
of a simple lead cross,

39:53.124 --> 39:56.528
small enough to fit in the palm
of his hand,

39:56.562 --> 39:59.965
Rick Lagina may have found
not only a clue

39:59.998 --> 40:03.669
that could help him solve
the Oak Island mystery...

40:03.702 --> 40:06.905
RICK: I've seen that shape
on a cross before.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.440
When I was in France,

40:08.474 --> 40:09.875
I saw a carving like that

40:09.908 --> 40:12.711
in the Templar prison in Domme.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.980
...but important evidence

40:15.013 --> 40:17.516
that could help prove
that Europeans,

40:17.549 --> 40:20.586
and perhaps surviving members
of the Knights Templar,

40:20.619 --> 40:24.055
successfully crossed the
Atlantic many centuries ago.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.694
KNIGHT:
I believe that it's bulletproof

40:28.727 --> 40:29.895
the Templars went to America.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.563
Why wouldn't they?

40:31.597 --> 40:32.898
They had the ability
and the motivation

40:32.931 --> 40:34.733
and the knowledge to do it.

40:34.766 --> 40:38.103
NARRATOR: Perhaps the real
treasure of Oak Island

40:38.136 --> 40:40.972
cannot be found
in a chest of gold

40:41.006 --> 40:44.442
or even in an Ark containing
the Ten Commandments.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.614
Perhaps the treasure
is one of knowledge...

40:48.647 --> 40:50.949
The Templars have nothing
to lose at this point.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.852
...both of mankind's history

40:53.885 --> 40:56.187
and its destiny.

40:56.221 --> 40:59.257
Sweet!

40:59.290 --> 41:01.493
RICK: Every piece of information
is important.

41:01.527 --> 41:02.961
Is this a treasure hunt? Yeah.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.563
But it's also
a information hunt.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.167
In the Money Pit,

41:09.200 --> 41:10.636
what I'd like it to be

41:10.669 --> 41:13.104
is the Knights Templar treasure

41:13.138 --> 41:14.873
and/or information.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.576
I would love it to be
the bottom of the Money Pit.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.111
Is it really there?
I don't know,

41:20.145 --> 41:22.113
and that's why we're here,
to find out.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.616
Put the last piece
in the puzzle.

41:24.650 --> 41:27.753
Hear it go click
and-and be happy.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.023
NARRATOR:
Ever since the discovery

41:32.057 --> 41:35.594
of the Money Pit in 1795,

41:35.627 --> 41:37.596
men of courage have come
to Oak Island

41:37.629 --> 41:41.700
in search
of an incredible fortune.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.769
But in many ways,

41:43.802 --> 41:46.705
their legacy is not unlike that
of the men

41:46.738 --> 41:49.775
who came here centuries ago,

41:49.808 --> 41:52.711
men of faith
who pursued a dream

41:52.744 --> 41:54.913
and who risked
everything they had

41:54.946 --> 41:57.215
in order to prove
that their lives

41:57.248 --> 41:59.785
were not lived in vain.
