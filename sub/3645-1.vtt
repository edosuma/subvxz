Me? Like a babe.

30:25.457 --> 30:29.026
I didn't, so unless you want
to write me up for narcolepsy,

30:29.028 --> 30:30.427
I suggest you
pick up the pace.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.362
Well, you know,
I'm sorry that this isn't

30:32.364 --> 30:33.730
more entertaining
for you, Sam,

30:33.732 --> 30:36.400
'cause I've got to say,
going back through
your greatest hits...

30:36.402 --> 30:40.404
Use of deadly force,
unlawful discharge of weapon,

30:40.406 --> 30:43.640
lying under oath,
illegal interrogation,

30:43.642 --> 30:45.375
coercion,
drunk and disorderly,

30:45.377 --> 30:47.044
and on and on,
right up until today.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.379
You know,
I've got to say I am amazed

30:49.381 --> 30:51.715
that you're even
still a policeman.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.585
And when I told you
that you were
great in your day,

30:54.587 --> 30:56.486
I mean the days
that cops used to run

30:56.488 --> 30:58.255
through this city
like thugs on a bender.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.224
And when I told you
that I admired you,

31:00.226 --> 31:01.758
I admire
the fact that you have

31:01.760 --> 31:03.427
somehow managed
to bully your way

31:03.429 --> 31:05.362
into holding on to
a job for 20 years

31:05.364 --> 31:07.898
that you should
have been kicked out of
when Ike was president.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.969
You're at the pinnacle, Sam,
everybody's hero,
but you know what?

31:11.971 --> 31:16.540
A pinnacle means
there's only one way
to go, and that's down.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.041
You can walk down quietly,

31:18.043 --> 31:21.111
or you can take
a long, loud fall.

31:22.081 --> 31:26.283
You know,
I thought getting a medal
was gonna be a lot more fun.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.988
BRIAN: (SIGHS) You've got to
be kidding me.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.123
I only kid when I've slept.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.291
So what do we do?

31:34.293 --> 31:35.826
Find the witness.

31:37.897 --> 31:38.362
Why?

31:38.364 --> 31:40.764
Look, we're not gonna
kill anyone, all right?

31:40.766 --> 31:42.232
That would screw up
my pension.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.534
Well, I'm late.
It's gonna have to
wait till tomorrow.

31:44.536 --> 31:45.535
All right, just calm down.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.537
Okay, we're not gonna do
anything at all.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.507
I know just the guy. Go.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.343
ROY: Man, I had no idea.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.812
CHARLIE: Yeah,
well, it's a problem, man.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.981
This cat's got
a whole army on the way.

31:57.983 --> 32:01.451
He thinks I'm in
his debt or something.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.720
Look, I just need you
and your guys
here for a while,

32:03.722 --> 32:07.291
like just a repelling force,
like a great wall.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.693
Look, man,
I got business. Serious.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.429
You think I'm not
being serious, man?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.731
This prick thinks I owe him.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.167
For life.

32:19.672 --> 32:23.173
Be cool, all right?
We'll work something out.

32:39.992 --> 32:43.126
ROY: Charmain,
she's with me now, you dig?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.127
BRIAN: Cool.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.096
No friction?
'Cause you got none from me.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.832
Not personally, no, but...

32:48.834 --> 32:50.534
But?

32:50.869 --> 32:52.669
Business. I want to trust you.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.404
I hear that.

32:56.008 --> 33:00.210
And I'm just not
seeing where I fit in.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.449
You fit in, brother.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.552
I just got to be very,
very careful.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.755
We're not talking about
a couple lids of grass.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.957
Come on.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.530
ROY: All right, everything
up till now has just been
setting the spike.

33:20.532 --> 33:24.001
Quality, volume, price,
they're all gonna triple.

33:24.937 --> 33:25.936
-I dig that.
-ROY: Good.

33:25.938 --> 33:30.040
Now, we've all done business,
and we've tested and passed
five ways from Sunday,

33:30.042 --> 33:31.775
but the mini-moves
and the power plays,

33:31.777 --> 33:33.343
they all got to drop.
I mean it.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.178
My supplier's got eyes
on this operation,

33:35.180 --> 33:37.180
and he likes what he sees.

33:38.851 --> 33:42.886
Just one thing.
I've got to meet him.

33:43.956 --> 33:44.955
Me, too.

33:44.957 --> 33:48.392
Care to look in the eyes
of who I'm risking prison for.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.861
My guy's already
way ahead of you.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.129
He's rolling as we speak.

33:52.131 --> 33:56.099
Says he'll meet you
anywhere you want tonight.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.934
(BRIAN INHALES)

33:59.238 --> 34:00.804
Your call.

34:10.115 --> 34:12.149
Be as the water.

34:12.451 --> 34:16.920
Be as the flow over the rock,

34:17.923 --> 34:20.724
the shaper of the rock.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.628
I am the shaper. No.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.065
Be... Be as...

34:29.601 --> 34:31.168
Be as the water.

34:31.937 --> 34:35.539
Be as the flow over the rock.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.542
Shape the rock.

34:43.015 --> 34:45.315
I shape the rock!

34:45.517 --> 34:47.350
I shape the rock!

34:47.920 --> 34:49.820
I shape the rock!

34:50.756 --> 34:52.622
(CRYING) I shape the rock.

34:55.394 --> 34:56.927
It's good to see you.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.495
It's good to see you,
too, sweetheart.

34:58.497 --> 35:02.232
-We haven't seen
you guys in a while.
-(LAUGHS) No.

35:06.105 --> 35:10.040
And we need a favor.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.476
What kind of favor?

35:12.911 --> 35:14.578
Later, baby.

35:16.615 --> 35:17.981
Later.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.255
We'll have to
reschedule, then.

35:26.058 --> 35:28.158
I can't leave Hal.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.361
We're still waiting to...

35:36.101 --> 35:38.368
What? What did he say?

35:38.871 --> 35:41.004
Hal's gonna live.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.648
Hey, Hodiak.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.650
We've got something.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.986
Not everything
but not nothing.

35:56.054 --> 35:59.122
So I go door to door,
the whole block.

35:59.124 --> 36:02.292
Said I was doing
follow-up for IA.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.594
Used my old badge.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.230
I forgot how soft
it makes people.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.734
The witness is not a neighbor.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.436
So the witness doesn't exist?

36:13.438 --> 36:18.508
No, but I'm pretty
sure that ass-lick
Kellaher's got a witness.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.745
So was there someone else
in the house that night?

36:23.215 --> 36:25.048
It's a cop.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.587
Hi, Colin.

36:30.589 --> 36:34.891
I think we met
the night Officer Shafe
was shot at and I was stabbed.

36:34.893 --> 36:39.162
Well, not actually met,
but that neighborhood's
your beat, right?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.431
Sam Hodiak.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.801
Your hand's a little damp,
there, Colin.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.503
You okay?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.240
-Get off of me.
-You heard shots.

36:50.242 --> 36:52.042
You came running
like any good cop would.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.545
You got to a window.
You looked in.
Am I right?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.479
I don't think I
should talk to you.

36:56.481 --> 36:59.015
I don't think
you should, either,
especially if you're thinking

36:59.017 --> 37:00.383
of testifying against me.
Come on.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.952
I don't know what
Detective Kellaher of

37:01.954 --> 37:03.220
Internal Affairs
said would happen to you

37:03.222 --> 37:04.454
if you testify
against a brother officer,

37:04.456 --> 37:06.389
-contradict his
sworn statement...
-Get off of me.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.726
...and challenge
the public pronouncements
of our beloved commissioner,

37:09.728 --> 37:11.661
but let me give you a preview.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.957
You would not believe
the day that I have had.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.426
I probably would.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.840

Okay.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.214
-ROY: Brothers,
we rode a lot of miles.
-MAN: Oh, yeah!

38:04.216 --> 38:08.985
-We ate a lot of dust,
kicked a lot of ass.
-(CROWD AGREEING)

38:08.987 --> 38:10.120
We hung tight,

38:10.122 --> 38:11.254
and it looked
like it was gonna be

38:11.256 --> 38:13.623
nothing more
but the damn same.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.893
But tonight,
tonight is a new game.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.028
ALL: Yeah!

38:18.030 --> 38:22.032
Tonight, we are finally
gonna get what
we got coming.

38:22.034 --> 38:22.465
ALL: Yeah.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.802

of bitches who got no code.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.904

what they got coming.

Don't. Don't go.

This is the supplier.
I've got to meet him.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.385
Guapo's got to meet him.

38:42.387 --> 38:45.055
Yeah, I don't think
that's what tonight is.

You're not gonna believe this.

About an hour ago,
I was supposed
to be down here.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.069
Charmain called, so I wasn't.

40:06.338 --> 40:07.837
Roy wanted me here.

40:07.839 --> 40:11.274
He didn't
actually do it, though.
None of the Satans did.

Charmain was
with them all night
at the Bleu Room.

Need a homicide detective.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.787
You think?

40:38.370 --> 40:43.206
Disarmed.
Not a gunfight. An execution.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.341
You see any casings?

40:45.343 --> 40:46.643
No.

done with an M16.
