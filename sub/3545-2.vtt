00:00.500 --> 00:03.000
<i>Previously, on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:04.875 --> 00:07.625
If Mary Alice was having a crisis,
we'd have known.

00:07.709 --> 00:09.875
She lives 50 feet away, for God's sakes.

00:09.959 --> 00:14.166
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must have been going on.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.667
Every time I'm around that man,
he tries to grab my ass.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.750
I made over 200,000
doing business with him last year.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.834
If he wants to grab your ass, let him.

00:23.625 --> 00:25.458
Why aren't you happy?

00:25.542 --> 00:29.500
It turns out I wanted
all the wrong things.

00:30.417 --> 00:33.250
- What's that?
- A letter addressed to Mary Alice.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.417
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?

00:45.959 --> 00:48.709
<i>An odd thing happens when we die.</i>

00:48.834 --> 00:50.458
<i>Our senses vanish.</i>

00:50.542 --> 00:54.250
<i>Taste, touch, smell and sound</i>
<i>become a distant memory.</i>

00:54.333 --> 00:58.834
<i>But our sight? Ah, our sight expands.</i>

00:58.917 --> 01:02.625
<i>And we can suddenly see the world</i>
<i>we've left behind so clearly.</i>

01:02.709 --> 01:08.166
<i>Of course, most of what's visible to the</i>
<i>dead could also be seen by the living.</i>

01:08.250 --> 01:11.208
<i>If they'd only take the time to look.</i>

01:11.291 --> 01:13.291
<i>Like my friend Gabrielle.</i>

01:13.375 --> 01:16.709
<i>I should've seen how unhappy</i>
<i>she was, but I didn't.</i>

01:17.291 --> 01:20.709
<i>I only saw her clothes from Paris,</i>

01:21.333 --> 01:24.041
<i>her platinum jewelry,</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:28.041
<i>and her brand-new diamond watch.</i>

01:28.125 --> 01:32.667
<i>Had I looked closer, I'd have seen</i>
<i>that Gabrielle was a drowning woman</i>

01:32.750 --> 01:35.250
<i>desperately in search of a life raft.</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:38.834
<i>Luckily for her, she found one.</i>

01:38.959 --> 01:41.834
<i>Of course, Gabrielle</i>
<i>only saw her young gardener</i>

01:41.917 --> 01:46.083
<i>as a way to infuse her life</i>
<i>with a little excitement.</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:53.041
<i>But now she was about to discover</i>
<i>just how exciting her life could get.</i>

02:04.375 --> 02:06.333
Damn it. Come on.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.542
Come on, hurry!

02:09.875 --> 02:11.208
Let's go, let's go.

02:13.417 --> 02:15.959
- Where's my clothes?
- I'll find them. Get out.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.333
Where?

02:17.417 --> 02:19.458
- Out the window.
- What?

02:23.458 --> 02:24.500
Go!

02:29.709 --> 02:33.041
- Hi, honey, you're home early.
- My meeting got cancelled.

02:35.917 --> 02:40.500
- Didn't you shower this morning?
- I just finished a workout.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.792
Where's John?

02:42.917 --> 02:46.917
- John?
- Yeah. That's his truck out front.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.917
<i>Gabrielle was panicked.</i>

02:49.000 --> 02:51.917
<i>She knew if her husband</i>
<i>discovered her secret,</i>

02:52.000 --> 02:55.583
<i>she would feel</i>
<i>the full force of his wrath.</i>

02:55.667 --> 02:59.500
- Hey, Mr Solis.
- Hey, John.

02:59.583 --> 03:02.875
- You take care of the ficus?
- I'll do it as soon as I'm done.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.125
All right.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.333
<i>She was quickly reminded</i>

03:09.417 --> 03:13.959
<i>- that what Carlos couldn't see...</i>
- Yeah. Sure, no problem.

03:14.041 --> 03:16.375
<i>...couldn't hurt her.</i>

04:03.583 --> 04:08.959
<i>The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane</i>
<i>had recently been shattered.</i>

04:09.041 --> 04:12.583
<i>First, by my suicide.</i>

04:12.750 --> 04:16.959
<i>And then by the discovery</i>
<i>of a note among my belongings</i>

04:17.041 --> 04:20.417
<i>that suggested a suspicious reason</i>
<i>for my desperate act.</i>

04:21.542 --> 04:24.458
<i>My friends gathered</i>
<i>to discuss its implications.</i>

04:24.542 --> 04:26.125
We should give it to Paul.

04:26.208 --> 04:29.375
He's still mourning, Susan.
He'll probably freak out.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.667
She was his wife.
He deserves to have all the facts.

04:32.750 --> 04:37.333
We could do it gently. We could tell him
about it over coffee and pastry.

04:37.417 --> 04:41.542
That'll be fun. "We have proof your wife
killed herself over a dark secret."

04:41.625 --> 04:44.542
- "Another bear claw?"
- We could always call the police.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.417
Maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.709
If it was, it was in very poor taste.

04:49.792 --> 04:52.792
No, this was serious. I know it was.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.792
We got to find out what was going on.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.709
There's a chance
we're not gonna like what we find.

04:57.792 --> 05:00.000
Isn't it worse to be in the dark,

05:00.083 --> 05:02.709
imagining she did
all these horrible things?

05:02.792 --> 05:07.625
It's the age-old question. How much do
we want to know about our neighbors?

05:16.291 --> 05:19.125
<i>My friends were right to be concerned.</i>

05:20.959 --> 05:24.041
<i>They knew that every family</i>
<i>has its secrets.</i>

05:25.375 --> 05:28.375
<i>And as my son and husband</i>
<i>could've told them,</i>

05:28.458 --> 05:32.291
<i>you need to think carefully</i>
<i>before digging them up.</i>

05:50.041 --> 05:51.709
<i>After talking for hours,</i>

05:51.792 --> 05:55.125
<i>my friends still hadn't agreed</i>
<i>on what to do with the note.</i>

05:55.834 --> 06:01.000
<i>So they decided to talk about it in</i>
<i>the morning after a good night's rest.</i>

06:02.333 --> 06:06.000
<i>But no one could fall asleep that night.</i>

06:06.709 --> 06:10.208
<i>They each kept thinking of my suicide.</i>

06:10.291 --> 06:14.500
<i>And how terribly alone I must've felt.</i>

06:14.583 --> 06:19.542
<i>You see, loneliness was something</i>
<i>my friends understood.</i>

06:19.625 --> 06:21.333
<i>All too well.</i>

06:27.834 --> 06:29.667
It's OK, I'm up.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.959
Good. I have a question for you.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.375
OK.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.750
- Remember when you proposed?
- For God's sake.

06:42.834 --> 06:46.125
We sat on Skyline Drive
and drank a bottle of apple wine

06:46.208 --> 06:48.750
and you turned to me and you said,

06:48.834 --> 06:51.291
"If you marry me, Bree Mason,

06:51.375 --> 06:53.917
I promise to love you
for the rest of my life."

06:54.875 --> 06:58.500
Even though I was engaged to Ty Grant,
and my father didn't like you,

06:58.583 --> 07:01.417
- I said yes.
- That was a long time ago.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.125
Cancel the meeting
with the divorce lawyer.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.125
We'll find a marriage counselor.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.583
- Bree...
- You promised.

07:17.417 --> 07:20.208
All right.

07:20.291 --> 07:23.417
Good. I'm going to make myself
some warm milk.

07:26.583 --> 07:31.750
- Would you like something to drink?
- Anything but apple wine.

07:36.792 --> 07:40.125
<i>Susan awoke that night</i>
<i>alone and parched.</i>

07:40.291 --> 07:41.959
<i>But as she gazed out her window,</i>

07:42.041 --> 07:47.709
<i>she saw the tall drink of water</i>
<i>she needed to quench her thirst.</i>

07:47.792 --> 07:50.041
"Dear Diary,
Mike doesn't know I exist."

07:50.125 --> 07:53.959
- Shut up.
- You're gonna have to ask him out.

07:54.083 --> 07:57.500
- I keep hoping he'll ask me out.
- How's that going?

07:57.834 --> 08:00.667
Shouldn't you be making brownies
for your friends?

08:00.792 --> 08:04.166
- Have you seen the measuring cup?
- The measuring cup?

08:05.166 --> 08:06.417
Yeah.

08:13.792 --> 08:17.792
Well, it's got to be here
somewhere. Just keep looking.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.125
- I know you're awake.
- I know you're a jerk.

08:26.208 --> 08:29.250
Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I'm sorry.

08:29.333 --> 08:33.000
I didn't marry you so I could have
dinner alone six times a week.

08:33.125 --> 08:37.041
You know how bored I was? I came
this close to cleaning the house.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.959
Don't be that way. I got you a gift.

08:39.041 --> 08:43.083
Nope. No, no. You're not gonna
buy your way out of this one.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.041
It's a good gift.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.792
- Is that white gold?
- Yeah. Put it on.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.792
And then make love to me.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.542
I'm not in the mood.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.875
But we could stay up and talk.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.875
When a man buys a woman jewelry,

09:10.959 --> 09:13.333
there are many things
he may want in return.

09:13.417 --> 09:17.875
For future reference,
conversation ain't one of 'em.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.959
- Hey, that was a joke.
- Yeah, right.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.625
- What the hell's wrong?
- Let go of me.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.667
- You've been a nightmare for a month.
- Stop.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.875
I can't fix it unless you tell me.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.250
It's not exciting anymore, Carlos.

09:42.125 --> 09:46.333
So what am I supposed to do?

09:46.417 --> 09:51.125
I don't know. Be the way you used to be.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.875
Surprise me. Take my breath away.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.959
OK.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.291
OK.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.750
- Hey, Susan.
- Mike.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.083
What's wrong?

10:22.208 --> 10:26.458
I didn't realize anybody was gonna be
out here. I just rolled out of bed.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.083
I'm sure you look fine.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.959
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo.

10:38.625 --> 10:42.291
Hey, come on.
Sorry, he scares easy.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.959
No, no, it's fine. I get it.

10:45.083 --> 10:48.709
I didn't mean to disturb you.
I'll see you later.

10:52.250 --> 10:57.333
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- Just the two of us?

10:58.333 --> 11:01.000
Well... and Julie.

11:02.458 --> 11:05.000
It's a thing we do
when somebody moves in.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.500
We invite them over for
a home-cooked meal. It's a tradition.

11:08.625 --> 11:12.667
- I thought you were a lousy cook.
- Well, I order take-out.

11:12.792 --> 11:15.834
You invite 'em for home-cooking
and give 'em take-out?

11:15.959 --> 11:19.500
Yeah, ah, it's sort of a new tradition.
I'm working out the kinks.

11:21.583 --> 11:26.041
I'll tell you what. How about I cook?
You guys come over to my place.

11:26.166 --> 11:29.041
Oh, great.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.583
- Friday night at six?
- I'll be there.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.000
Right. Come on.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.166
Bye, Bongo.

11:47.250 --> 11:51.250
Julie! Mike Delfino just invited us
to dinner Friday night.

11:51.375 --> 11:52.875
He did? Cool.

11:52.959 --> 11:56.500
But only I'm going because
you're gonna come down with something

11:56.625 --> 11:59.750
that requires bed rest and fluids.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.875
<i>Julie was glad</i>
<i>Susan was rekindling her love life.</i>

12:02.959 --> 12:08.041
<i>Of course, she was unaware of her</i>
<i>mother's recent track record with fire.</i>

12:08.125 --> 12:14.458
It's all gone. Everything my ex-husband
worked for all those years, gone.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.125
Don't worry about clothing.

12:16.208 --> 12:19.291
I already started a collection
from the neighborhood.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.458
What? I don't want to wear
other people's old crap.

12:22.583 --> 12:26.959
You can be homeless or ungracious.
You really can't afford to be both.

12:27.041 --> 12:30.959
That reminds me. My insurance check
still hasn't come yet.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.959
Can I stay with you
a few more weeks?

12:33.041 --> 12:35.458
Of course. What kind
of Christian would I be

12:35.542 --> 12:38.625
if I denied shelter to a friend in need?

12:38.709 --> 12:42.125
Look. Here's something we can salvage.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.667
Your measuring cup.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.083
We can scrape of the burnt part
and it'll look good as new.

12:48.208 --> 12:51.166
That's not my cup. Mine was plastic.

12:52.291 --> 12:56.667
- Well, how did it get in here?
- I don't know. Who cares?

13:02.250 --> 13:05.917
Now, would you put that down
and start looking for jewelry.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.250
<i>Dr. Albert Goldfine</i>
<i>was the most accomplished</i>

13:15.333 --> 13:17.375
<i>marriage counselor in the city.</i>

13:18.333 --> 13:22.125
<i>He had dealt with problems</i>
<i>ranging from substance abuse,</i>

13:22.250 --> 13:26.542
<i>to infidelity,</i>

13:26.625 --> 13:28.917
<i>to domestic violence.</i>

13:31.333 --> 13:34.834
<i>Yes, Dr. Goldfine</i>
<i>thought he had seen it all.</i>

13:34.917 --> 13:37.917
<i>And then he met the Van De Kamps.</i>

13:38.000 --> 13:42.667
Hi. I'm Bree.
And this is my husband Rex.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.458
And I brought you
some homemade potpourri.

13:48.041 --> 13:52.500
The answer is yes.
You're about to make a fortune off us.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.709
- Get off!
- Boys!

13:56.834 --> 14:01.917
Guys, I'm begging you.
Sit in your seats.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.625
I'm not gonna tell you again. Buckle up.

14:07.834 --> 14:11.000
I mean it, so help me...

14:11.083 --> 14:14.250
Oh, shoot. Crap!

14:17.208 --> 14:20.250
I was playing with it first!

14:20.333 --> 14:23.291
License and registration, please.

14:23.375 --> 14:28.083
- Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?
- I have a theory.

14:28.166 --> 14:31.166
The kids should be sitting
wearing seat belts.

14:31.250 --> 14:36.125
I yelled at them. They never listen.
It's very frustrating.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.500
You have to find a way to control them.
After all, that's your job.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.834
<i>Though he'd been</i>
<i>a policeman for six years,</i>

14:43.917 --> 14:49.083
<i>Officer Hayes had never found himself</i>
<i>in a truly dangerous situation.</i>

14:49.166 --> 14:53.375
<i>Then again, he had never before told</i>
<i>a woman how to raise her children.</i>

14:57.250 --> 15:00.792
- Are you saying I'm a bad mother?
- Get back in your car, please.

15:00.875 --> 15:04.208
I have no help. My husband's
always away on business.

15:04.291 --> 15:06.542
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step back now.

15:06.667 --> 15:10.000
My babysitter joined
the witness relocation program.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.875
- I haven't slept through the night...
- Ma'am.

15:12.959 --> 15:16.792
...in six years. And for you
to stand there and judge me...

15:26.709 --> 15:33.625
OK. I'm not gonna give you a ticket. I'm
just gonna let you off with a warning.

15:34.917 --> 15:38.583
I accept your apology.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.000
He's kicking me again!

15:47.083 --> 15:48.542
Buckle up.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.959
- Mrs. Solis.
- Hello, Jonathan.

16:23.458 --> 16:27.083
Well, this is my room.
Sorry about the mess.

16:27.166 --> 16:30.208
Oh, don't worry about it.

16:30.291 --> 16:34.166
You just missed my mom. On Friday,
she coaches my sister's soccer team.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.667
Yes, I heard that.

16:36.750 --> 16:41.250
John, we need to talk about
what happened the other day.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.458
Mr. Solis isn't catching on, is he?

16:43.542 --> 16:47.250
No, no, he doesn't have a clue,
God love him.

16:47.333 --> 16:51.291
It's just I was thinking
that when you come over to garden,

16:51.375 --> 16:54.959
you might actually have to garden.

16:55.041 --> 16:59.500
Great, you're breaking up with me.
In my own bedroom.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.834
No, no. I'm not dumping you.

17:02.959 --> 17:05.875
Lately, you've been
the only thing keeping me going.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.166
But we can't do it
at my house anymore.

17:08.250 --> 17:11.834
So then, where do you want to do it?

17:11.959 --> 17:16.375
Well, what time does your mom
get back from soccer practice?

17:17.333 --> 17:21.250
- Mrs. Solis!
- Hurry. We don't have much time.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.000
And so there's just the four of us.

17:38.083 --> 17:42.792
My older son, Andrew, is 16,
Danielle is 15 and...

17:42.875 --> 17:46.542
I don't need to see pictures.
Bree, you've spent most of the hour

17:46.625 --> 17:48.625
engaging in small talk.

17:48.709 --> 17:51.083
- Have I?
- Yes.

17:51.208 --> 17:54.834
Rex has been very vocal
about his issues.

17:54.917 --> 18:00.625
Don't you want to discuss
your feelings about your marriage?

18:06.542 --> 18:10.417
Bree doesn't like
to talk about her feelings.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.333
To be honest, it's hard to know
if she has any.

18:14.417 --> 18:19.625
Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?
Who knows?

18:19.750 --> 18:26.750
She's always pleasant, and I can't
tell you how annoying that is.

18:26.875 --> 18:31.917
Whatever she feels,
it's so far below the surface...

18:41.166 --> 18:43.250
Bree?

18:44.750 --> 18:48.875
- Bree?
- What? I'm sorry.

18:48.959 --> 18:52.542
Would you like to respond
to what Rex just said?

18:52.625 --> 18:56.291
- Oh...
- Is there some truth there?

18:56.417 --> 19:01.792
Do you use housework as a way
to disengage emotionally?

19:01.875 --> 19:03.458
Of course not!

19:06.125 --> 19:10.875
This is great.
I got tons of homework tonight.

19:10.959 --> 19:14.250
- It's easy to concentrate after sex.
- I'm glad I could help.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.250
Education's very important.

19:16.625 --> 19:19.250
I got something for you.

19:19.333 --> 19:23.500
I was gonna give it to you next time I
mowed your lawn, but since you're here.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.125
- It's a rose.
- It's not just any rose.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.667
Look at all the petals.
There's no flaws.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.625
It's perfect.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.959
Just like you.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.333
<i>The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.</i>

19:39.458 --> 19:43.250
I spent days looking for
just the right one. I finally found it.

19:43.333 --> 19:47.291
<i>For John, this was no longer</i>
<i>a meaningless little affair.</i>

19:47.375 --> 19:51.792
<i>Gabrielle could now clearly see</i>
<i>he was falling in love with her.</i>

19:51.875 --> 19:54.000
It's just beautiful.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.667
I got to go.

20:03.041 --> 20:04.291
Goodbye.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.709
Hey, you. What are we having?

20:12.834 --> 20:17.083
I talked to Julie
and she suggested rib-eye steaks.

20:17.166 --> 20:20.291
- She said that's your favorite.
- I love my steak.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.291
Hi, Mike.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.250
Susan.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.834
Edie.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.625
I'm sorry about your house.
How are you?

20:30.709 --> 20:35.458
All right, I guess.
Is somebody having a party?

20:35.542 --> 20:38.875
No, Susan's just throwing me
a traditional welcome dinner.

20:39.041 --> 20:42.375
Only I'm cooking.
And having it at my house.

20:43.709 --> 20:46.875
Traditional? Hm! I didn't get one.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.959
Oh, it's a new tradition.

20:49.083 --> 20:52.500
It won't be anything fancy.
Just a little home cooking.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.583
That sounds so good.

20:54.667 --> 20:58.625
<i>Susan suddenly had an awful feeling</i>
<i>in the pit of her stomach.</i>

20:58.709 --> 21:01.458
I've been having
nothing but fast food lately.

21:01.542 --> 21:06.166
<i>As if she was watching</i>
<i>an accident in slow motion.</i>

21:06.250 --> 21:10.792
<i>She knew it would happen,</i>
<i>but was powerless to stop it.</i>

21:15.417 --> 21:17.417
Would you like
to join us for dinner?

21:17.500 --> 21:23.000
That's so sweet. No, I don't want
to intrude. Three's a crowd.

21:23.083 --> 21:27.291
No, it's not like that.
I mean, Susan's bringing Julie.

21:27.375 --> 21:30.667
It's not like that.
The more the merrier.

21:30.750 --> 21:34.208
- Well, this'll be fun.
- All right. Tomorrow night.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.417
- We'll eat at six.
- Great.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.375
- And Susan...
- Yeah?

21:39.458 --> 21:42.875
This'll make up for the dinner
that you never threw me.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.667
Right.

21:44.750 --> 21:46.166
Ta-ta.

21:46.250 --> 21:50.375
Should I have told her we were having
steak. She's not a vegetarian?

21:50.458 --> 21:53.333
Oh, no, no.

21:53.417 --> 21:57.375
No, Edie's definitely a carnivore.

22:02.875 --> 22:07.667
Here's what I pulled for Edie.
Most of the clothes aren't that stylish.

22:07.792 --> 22:12.959
Don't worry. Edie's a beggar now,
which means she can't be a chooser.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.709
Of course, we don't have to
add salt to the wound.

22:16.834 --> 22:19.166
Listen, I was just
getting dinner ready...

22:19.250 --> 22:21.291
Say no more.
I'll get out of your hair.

22:21.375 --> 22:22.458
No, no.

22:22.542 --> 22:27.166
Was that you I saw getting
pulled over by a policeman?

22:27.291 --> 22:31.792
Yeah, the boys were acting up in the
car, I couldn't get them to sit down.

22:31.875 --> 22:35.667
- Young boys can be so willful.
- I try everything.

22:35.750 --> 22:40.125
I scream. I threaten.
I reason. I beg. Nothing works.

22:40.208 --> 22:43.542
I don't know if they're too young
to understand

22:43.667 --> 22:47.542
or they're just getting some
perverse joy out of testing me.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.208
My mother had the worst time
with me in the car.

22:50.291 --> 22:56.625
So one time, she stopped and left me
on the side of the road and drove off.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.500
- You're kidding?
- She came back immediately.

23:01.583 --> 23:05.041
But I never misbehaved in the car again.
You should try that.

23:05.125 --> 23:09.250
Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids
by the side of the road.

23:09.333 --> 23:12.125
When it comes to discipline,
you must be creative.

23:12.208 --> 23:14.917
My mother knew that. Smart lady.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.208
Of course, she's in a home now.
And her mind has just turned to mush.

23:21.250 --> 23:24.500
Like I said, I should go back
and get dinner ready.

23:24.583 --> 23:28.208
Oh, right, well. Goodbye.

23:28.333 --> 23:31.041
Goodbye.

23:31.125 --> 23:34.083
Susan, have you been able to find
old clothes for Edie?

23:34.208 --> 23:35.792
She has nothing to wear.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.291
I thought that was the look
she was going for.

23:38.375 --> 23:43.291
Oh, Susan, Edie may be trash,
but she's still a human being.

23:55.667 --> 24:00.333
Zach, is your dad home?
I need to talk to him.

24:08.417 --> 24:11.542
Hey, Paul, I hope I'm not interrupting.

24:11.625 --> 24:14.375
Actually, I was getting ready
to go somewhere.

24:14.458 --> 24:18.959
I just wanted to come by and say hello.
See how you guys are doing.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.125
We're trying to move on.
It's been pretty tough.

24:22.208 --> 24:26.625
I can only imagine.
Not knowing why Mary Alice...

24:26.709 --> 24:29.750
- Why what?
- Why she did it.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.291
- Here, let me help you.
- I've got it. I've got it.

24:40.667 --> 24:44.834
- I'm sorry if I upset you.
- Can I be frank?

24:44.959 --> 24:48.000
- Of course.
- I don't care what her reasons were.

24:48.125 --> 24:52.041
Maybe she was depressed, maybe
she was bored. It doesn't matter.

24:52.125 --> 24:57.166
She abandoned her husband
and her son and I'll never forgive her.

25:13.166 --> 25:17.667
<i>As I watched Susan,</i>
<i>I couldn't help feeling sorry for her.</i>

25:17.750 --> 25:20.834
<i>She wanted so much to know why I did it.</i>

25:23.583 --> 25:25.667
<i>Why I killed myself.</i>

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
<i>It's not enough to want the truth.</i>

25:32.125 --> 25:35.458
<i>You must know where to look for it.</i>

25:36.583 --> 25:43.500
<i>And the truth is elusive</i>
<i>because it knows where to hide.</i>

25:51.291 --> 25:55.250
Hello, Julie, I talked to your mom
about donating some clothes for Edie.

25:55.333 --> 25:59.500
She's at Mrs. Van De Kamp's, but I'll
see if she left some stuff upstairs.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.917
Julie, I was just admiring
your new measuring cup.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.166
- Yeah, we've lost ours.
- Really?

26:41.250 --> 26:45.583
- So I couldn't find the clothes. Sorry.
- That's OK.

26:46.208 --> 26:49.875
- If you want me to keep looking.
- No. You've done more than enough.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.083
Truly.

26:57.959 --> 27:01.625
Bree. Rex just called. He won't
be able to meet you here today.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.875
Apparently, there was
an emergency at the hospital.

27:04.959 --> 27:08.041
Well, I wish he'd called me.

27:08.125 --> 27:12.041
He suggested perhaps you'd like
to meet with me by yourself.

27:12.125 --> 27:15.583
You've been very quiet
in our joint sessions.

27:16.291 --> 27:17.875
What?

27:17.959 --> 27:22.333
Oh, no, thank you.
I have some things I need to do today.

27:22.417 --> 27:26.166
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.083
OK.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.333
Dr. Goldfine,
there is something you can do for me.

27:40.458 --> 27:44.000
- What's that?
- Take off your coat.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.583
You're taking Julie
on your dinner date with Mike?

27:49.667 --> 27:52.834
If Edie's gonna be there,
I'll need emotional support.

27:52.959 --> 27:56.000
I can't believe she wormed her way in.
How did you let her?

27:56.125 --> 27:59.667
I don't know. I was gonna take her out,
but it happened so fast.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.000
You need to get there early,

28:02.125 --> 28:05.083
spend time with Mike
before the barracuda gets there.

28:05.166 --> 28:08.583
That's a good idea.
Edie will get there at 5.45,

28:08.667 --> 28:12.917
which means her breasts will arrive
at 5.30, so I should shoot for five.

28:13.041 --> 28:15.333
I'm just gonna take these upstairs.

28:15.458 --> 28:18.500
I'm gonna keep
my one little bag and go home.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.959
That is a beautiful rose.
Where did you get it?

28:25.041 --> 28:27.333
John gave it to me.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.792
John, your gardener,
he gave you a rose?

28:31.875 --> 28:36.542
Yes. I'm having some
new bushes planted outside

28:36.667 --> 28:38.750
and he gave me that as a color palette.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.583
OK.

28:45.875 --> 28:48.500
Sure is beautiful, isn't it?

28:52.208 --> 28:54.208
Yes, it is.

28:54.291 --> 28:58.166
I'm sure Freud
would not approve of this.

28:58.250 --> 29:03.375
Who cares? I took Psychology.
We learned all about Freud.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.458
- A miserable human being.
- What makes you say that?

29:06.542 --> 29:07.917
Think about it.

29:08.041 --> 29:12.583
He grew up in the late 1800s.
There were no appliances back then.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.375
His mother had to do everything by hand.

29:15.458 --> 29:19.000
Just backbreaking work
from sun up to sundown.

29:19.083 --> 29:22.417
Not to mention the countless
other sacrifices she had to make

29:22.542 --> 29:25.333
to take care of her family,
and what does he do?

29:25.458 --> 29:29.667
He becomes famous peddling a theory
that the problems of most adults

29:29.750 --> 29:33.125
can be traced back to something awful
their mother has done.

29:34.166 --> 29:36.333
She must've felt so betrayed.

29:36.417 --> 29:41.750
He saw how hard she worked.
He saw what she did for him.

29:41.834 --> 29:45.792
Did he even ever think to say thank you?

29:49.083 --> 29:50.166
I doubt it.

30:00.041 --> 30:01.625
There you go.

30:01.750 --> 30:06.417
Just so you know, many of Freud's
theories have been discredited.

30:07.667 --> 30:09.625
Good.

30:16.458 --> 30:19.792
Boys, I am not gonna
tell you again. Sit.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.291
I mean it. I am serious.

30:23.375 --> 30:28.458
You guys are gonna be in so much trouble
if you don't sit back in those seats.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.083
<i>For the first time,</i>

30:35.166 --> 30:38.750
<i>Lynette could see this was not</i>
<i>the innocent play of children.</i>

30:39.333 --> 30:41.667
<i>She was being challenged.</i>

30:42.917 --> 30:46.959
<i>So she decided</i>
<i>it was time to get creative.</i>

30:54.709 --> 30:57.834
Out! Can't behave,
you heard me, you cannot ride.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.583
You, out, move it.

31:10.417 --> 31:12.917
Where is she going?

31:20.250 --> 31:23.792
OK. Mommy's a genius.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.917
Five, six, all right.

31:38.542 --> 31:41.125
Mommy'll be right back.

31:41.208 --> 31:43.542
Boys? Boys?

31:44.291 --> 31:45.709
Boys?!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.917
Porter! Preston! Parker!

31:53.667 --> 31:56.917
Come on, now, 'cause Mommy
doesn't think it's funny.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.333
Excuse me. I'm looking for my boys.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.875
Three boys with red hair.
Have you seen them?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.375
Yeah. And I saw you drive away
and leave 'em.

32:04.458 --> 32:07.667
I was just trying to scare them.
Did you see where they went?

32:07.750 --> 32:09.583
Yeah, they're in my kitchen.

32:09.667 --> 32:13.625
Listen, it seems to me that you have
some anger management issues.

32:13.834 --> 32:16.375
I have four kids under six.

32:16.458 --> 32:19.083
I absolutely
have anger management issues.

32:19.166 --> 32:23.041
You need to talk to somebody
because abandoning your children...

32:23.125 --> 32:25.250
I didn't abandon them. I came back.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.750
I'm just saying it's not normal.

32:27.834 --> 32:31.834
My kids aren't normal
and now I don't have time for this so...

32:31.917 --> 32:33.166
Boys, get out here.

32:33.250 --> 32:36.917
I don't think they should
go anywhere until you calm down.

32:36.959 --> 32:39.458
- Get in the car.
- She's got cookies.

32:39.542 --> 32:42.125
- Bring 'em, we're leaving.
- Stay put.

32:42.250 --> 32:44.417
- I don't think so.
- Listen, lady...

32:44.500 --> 32:47.041
- Leave my mommy alone.
- Let go of me.

32:47.125 --> 32:50.917
- What's the matter with you?
- Son of bi...

32:53.458 --> 32:55.959
- Run, boys, run!
- Come on!

33:00.959 --> 33:03.208
- Crap.
- Get back here.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.792
Boys, you're gonna need
to put on your...

33:11.917 --> 33:15.333
Get back
or I'm gonna call Social Services.

33:35.291 --> 33:39.375
Oh, my God! Carlos, what have you done?

33:39.500 --> 33:44.000
I saw it when I drove by the dealership.
I thought you'd look beautiful in this.

33:47.125 --> 33:52.917
It cost me an arm and a leg. It's got
GPS navigation, 200 watt stereo...

33:53.000 --> 33:54.959
It is beautiful.

33:55.041 --> 33:59.291
So did I take your breath away?

33:59.375 --> 34:00.917
Absolutely.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.875
Is it the best gift you've ever gotten?

34:07.041 --> 34:10.542
<i>Gabrielle could see</i>
<i>what this gesture had cost Carlos,</i>

34:10.625 --> 34:13.834
<i>so she responded</i>
<i>the only way she knew how.</i>

34:19.375 --> 34:24.125
<i>She had a feeling the truth would've</i>
<i>been lost on her husband anyway.</i>

34:24.208 --> 34:28.583
<i>After all, it's the rare man</i>
<i>who understands the value</i>

34:28.667 --> 34:31.792
<i>of a single perfect rose.</i>

34:53.250 --> 34:55.625
- Susan.
- I hope you don't mind.

34:55.709 --> 34:57.625
I came by early to help you set up.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.083
Hey, Susan.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.333
Don't worry,
we have everything under control.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.750
Bongo! I don't know why he barks at you.

35:13.834 --> 35:18.041
I wouldn't take it personally.
Dogs are very sensitive.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.792
What's up, Bongo? You never know
what freaks them out, huh?

35:21.917 --> 35:25.375
<i>In the distance,</i>
<i>Susan thought she heard a bell ring.</i>

35:25.458 --> 35:29.250
Is it a strange noise?
What is it? A weird smell?

35:29.333 --> 35:32.834
<i>Round one had started.</i>

35:32.959 --> 35:34.500
All I'm saying is

35:34.583 --> 35:38.542
this whole it takes two to mess up
a marriage theory is bull.

35:38.625 --> 35:41.709
- Our problems are because of her.
- That is not true, Rex.

35:41.792 --> 35:46.458
What have I been doing for
the past 20 years that's been so awful?

35:46.583 --> 35:49.959
You're not saying anything
because I've been a great husband.

35:50.041 --> 35:53.917
- And it kills you to admit that.
- Rex, I'm curious.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.542
Do you ever acknowledge
the benefits of living with Bree?

36:01.083 --> 36:02.834
By your own admission,

36:02.959 --> 36:06.208
your home's always clean,
your clothes always pressed,

36:06.333 --> 36:08.500
sounds like a wonderful cook,

36:08.625 --> 36:13.875
despite her flaws, do you ever
remember to say thank you?

36:16.083 --> 36:19.667
- Thank you?
- Yes.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.625
Bongo! Get down! Down!

36:26.709 --> 36:30.000
- Go away.
- Down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:30.125 --> 36:33.125
So who's the guy that lives across
from Mrs. Huber again?

36:33.208 --> 36:37.750
That's Mr. Mullen. If he invites you in,
you have to meet all of his pets.

36:37.834 --> 36:41.375
- That's OK. I love animals.
- He's a taxidermist.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.542
OK, thanks for the warning.

36:46.834 --> 36:50.709
Isn't Mr. Mullen's brother
your divorce attorney?

36:50.792 --> 36:53.458
Yes, yes, he was.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.709
Can I say something?

36:55.792 --> 36:59.875
In my heart, I still believe that you
and Karl are gonna get back together.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.625
I've never seen two people more in love.

37:05.709 --> 37:09.834
She's never gonna find that kind of
chemistry with another man. Never.

37:09.917 --> 37:13.125
<i>It was everything Susan could do</i>
<i>to keep a smile on her face.</i>

37:13.208 --> 37:16.542
<i>Round two had started</i>
<i>and she was already taking a beating.</i>

37:16.625 --> 37:19.542
- You know, Mrs. Britt.
<i>- What Edie hadn't counted on...</i>

37:19.625 --> 37:23.041
- I always liked...
<i>- ...Susan had someone in her corner.</i>

37:23.166 --> 37:25.709
Mr. Rothwell, your fourth husband.

37:25.792 --> 37:30.333
He was my second husband.
I've only been married twice.

37:30.417 --> 37:34.291
You weren't married to the tattooed guy
they took away in handcuffs?

37:34.375 --> 37:37.375
No, Julie, she wasn't married to Javier.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.667
He was just one
of her special friends.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.583
I think we should change the subject.

37:42.709 --> 37:46.083
Unless you want to
keep talking about it.

37:47.625 --> 37:49.208
- Bongo, get down.
- Wait.

37:49.291 --> 37:52.417
- Let me show you something.
- He loves that gravy.

37:52.500 --> 37:56.291
Come. While you were in there
tossing a salad, I taught him something.

37:58.917 --> 38:01.000
<i>Susan was furious with Edie</i>

38:01.083 --> 38:04.458
<i>for using a dog</i>
<i>to ingratiate herself with its owner.</i>

38:04.583 --> 38:08.959
<i>She was also furious with Mike for not</i>
<i>seeing through this blatant maneuver.</i>

38:09.083 --> 38:11.125
- So...
<i>- But mostly...</i>

38:11.208 --> 38:13.166
...I'm gonna get the desserts.

38:13.291 --> 38:18.333
<i>...she was furious with herself</i>
<i>for not having thought of it first.</i>

38:18.417 --> 38:21.125
I can barely get him to sit.

38:21.709 --> 38:23.875
Best dog ever. Yes, you are.

38:24.959 --> 38:29.500
- I've never seen him walk on two legs.
- He knows who to come to.

38:36.792 --> 38:41.000
- Here's your dessert.
- Thank you. Mike, this looks yummy.

38:45.583 --> 38:49.583
Look at that. Looks like Bongo's
finally warming up to Susan.

38:51.125 --> 38:54.667
We just got off on the wrong foot.
We're best buddies now.

38:57.417 --> 38:59.333
What a good boy!

39:01.542 --> 39:04.333
- Bongo, are you OK?
- What's wrong with him?

39:04.458 --> 39:07.375
I don't know.
I've never heard him make that sound.

39:08.417 --> 39:10.667
- You OK, fella?
- Mom?

39:10.750 --> 39:12.417
You all right?

39:13.500 --> 39:16.333
You OK?

39:21.333 --> 39:24.583
The vet's number's on the fridge.
Say I'll be right there.

39:24.667 --> 39:27.500
Don't worry.
I'll get everything cleaned up.

39:27.583 --> 39:28.667
Thanks, Edie.

39:30.583 --> 39:32.333
Is there anything I can do?

39:34.375 --> 39:35.375
No.

40:02.709 --> 40:04.875
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:04.959 --> 40:06.625
How's Bongo?

40:06.709 --> 40:09.208
I'm waiting to see
if they'll have to operate.

40:09.291 --> 40:11.166
Oh, God!

40:16.500 --> 40:18.709
I stopped and I got this for...

40:20.417 --> 40:22.583
I am just so sorry for this.

40:22.709 --> 40:24.709
I'm sorry I snapped at you. I just...

40:24.792 --> 40:28.166
- Oh, no, it's OK.
- Good news.

40:28.250 --> 40:32.125
- We won't have to do surgery.
- Oh, that's great.

40:32.208 --> 40:35.000
We've given him something
to help pass the earring.

40:35.125 --> 40:39.208
- When he does, should we retrieve it?
- I'm gonna say no.

40:39.291 --> 40:43.375
OK. You should be able
to take him home in about an hour.

40:43.458 --> 40:47.959
Wow. You must be so relieved.

40:49.417 --> 40:52.500
I'm sorry, I was just really worried.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.792
It was your dog. I get it.

40:54.875 --> 40:57.625
Actually, he was my wife's dog,

40:57.750 --> 41:01.834
one of the last thing's she said to me
in the hospital before she died

41:01.959 --> 41:06.625
was to be sure I looked after him
and I promised her I would.

41:06.750 --> 41:08.792
<i>And just like that,</i>

41:08.917 --> 41:13.041
<i>Susan could suddenly</i>
<i>see something she'd never seen before.</i>

41:13.125 --> 41:15.792
He meant so much to her.

41:15.875 --> 41:20.667
<i>Mike Delfino was still in love</i>
<i>with his late wife.</i>

41:20.750 --> 41:24.417
And if something had happened,
I would've felt like I'd failed her.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.709
I know that sounds stupid, but...

41:27.792 --> 41:29.500
<i>And she knew right then,</i>

41:29.625 --> 41:33.792
<i>neither she nor Edie would be laying</i>
<i>claim to his heart any time soon.</i>

41:33.875 --> 41:36.208
No, it doesn't. Not at all.

41:36.291 --> 41:41.250
<i>So she decided, for now, she could</i>
<i>settle for just being his friend.</i>

41:41.333 --> 41:43.625
This is for you.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.959
Well, for Bongo. You give it to him.

42:00.375 --> 42:03.834
<i>Yes, as I look back</i>
<i>at the world I left behind,</i>

42:03.917 --> 42:07.250
<i>it's all so clear to me.</i>

42:07.333 --> 42:10.417
<i>The beauty that waits to be unveiled.</i>

42:10.500 --> 42:12.959
<i>The mysteries that long to be uncovered.</i>

42:16.875 --> 42:21.250
<i>But people so rarely</i>
<i>stop to take a look.</i>

42:21.333 --> 42:24.125
<i>They just keep moving.</i>

42:28.208 --> 42:30.458
<i>It's a shame, really.</i>

42:30.542 --> 42:33.500
<i>There's so much to see.</i>
