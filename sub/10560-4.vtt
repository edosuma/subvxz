01:00.811 --> 01:01.932
Give me a second, Higgins.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.447
I have to put a call in to the station.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.984
It's fantastic having all
these boxes all over the place.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.197
Now we can communicate-

01:08.402 --> 01:09.619
Mind yourself, lad.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.863
Now we can communicate

01:11.071 --> 01:12.414
from almost anywhere in the city.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.076
Imagine one day, they
make a telephone so small

01:15.367 --> 01:17.244
that you could carry it around with you.

01:17.536 --> 01:18.583
It would never work.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.372
I mean, you'd be dragging
wires all over town.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.586
You'd trip the horses.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.546
Oh! Station number four, please.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.381
George, just so you know,

01:25.669 --> 01:27.046
I began reading your book, and I-

01:27.337 --> 01:29.214
Ah, yes!

02:04.291 --> 02:05.713
I never saw it coming, sir.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.719
You couldn't have.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.755
How's Henry?

02:13.634 --> 02:16.228
He'll be right as rain.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.151
I should be assisting Detective Murdoch.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.545
Stay where you are, Crabtree.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.854
Detective Murdoch will be fine.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.315
Wesley, make sure Crabtree and Higgins

02:24.603 --> 02:27.356
get to Toronto General straightaway.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.209
Right, everybody off the street, please.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.826
There's nothing to see.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.907
Move along, please, sir.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.822
This is a disaster.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.914
There was over $3.000
worth of goods in there.

02:36.948 --> 02:37.824
Stand down, sir.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.584
Who's going to pay for my losses?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.415
Well, not the Constabulary.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.183
Now, please get off the street
so we can continue with our job.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.754
Can you please tell me what is going on?

02:47.042 --> 02:49.636
Two of our constables
were seriously injured.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.548
Doing a job they're well-paid to do.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.433
You shut your mouth, sir,
or I'll shut it for you.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.185
Now, I've told you once
to get off the street.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.722
I won't tell you again.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.606
Inspector.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.858
I think I may have found something.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.770
What have you got, Murdoch?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.423
Sir, I believe this is the result

03:08.563 --> 03:10.907
of an incendiary device.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.613
A bomb?

03:12.901 --> 03:16.826
It seems someone has taken an
intense dislike to Mr. Milne.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.792
Doesn't look like any
kind of military ordnance

03:27.874 --> 03:28.921
I've seen before.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.489
I've yet to locale any insignia

03:30.711 --> 03:32.509
or manufacturer's mark.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.343
- Homemade?
- I would say so.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.723
Quite a powerful device.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.429
<i>Mm.</i>

03:37.718 --> 03:40.016
Is it possible that our lads
were the intended victims?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.823
Given the placement of the bomb, sir,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.022
inside of Milne's shop,

03:43.306 --> 03:44.979
I would say that was the intended target.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.235
But our lads walk that beat every day.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.999
Well, I suppose anything's possible.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.778
A device like this could kill someone.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.942
Bastards.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.827
As soon as you find out
the origin of that device,

03:56.111 --> 03:57.033
Murdoch, let me know.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.537
Yes, sir.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.491
How are you, lad?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.000
Welcome back.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.912
<i>Crabtree!</i>

04:06.580 --> 04:07.832
Crabtree.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.251
George.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.430
- Crabtree.
- Ah, Inspector.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.264
I admire your dedication to the cause,

04:19.551 --> 04:21.019
but you could have taken
a couple of days off.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.583
No, that's not necessary, sir.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.851
Any word on Higgins?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.766
Is he going to be all right'?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.980
He's well cared for.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.824
- Constable
Crab-tree? - Ah!

04:34.107 --> 04:35.984
I heard the news. Are you faring well?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.653
I'm fine, Dr. Grace, thank you.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.144
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.782
- A favor, Constable Crabtree.
- What's that?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.434
It would be to my great advantage

04:43.533 --> 04:45.501
if I could accompany you
on your investigation.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.662
Why?

04:46.953 --> 04:47.954
I would love a greater understanding

04:48.246 --> 04:49.486
of how the police do their job.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.786
Doctor, while I don't doubt
you can handle yourself

04:52.042 --> 04:53.294
in any number of situations,

04:53.585 --> 04:55.303
police work can be very dangerous.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.305
I can see that.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.012
Bu! I am prepared to assume the risk.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.636
I'm sorry, Doctor.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.930
It would be irresponsible of me.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.703
- Thank you.
- All right.

05:26.952 --> 05:27.999
Henry?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.124
Detective Murdoch, I-

05:34.751 --> 05:36.048
A! Ease, Constable.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.680
Save your strength.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.136
Was anyone else hurt, sir?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.676
There was so many women and children.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.346
Nothing serious.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.435
And George?

05:47.722 --> 05:51.101
It would appear he has a
much harder head than you do.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.566
That's no surprise.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.322
Did you get the bomber, sir'?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.324
I've only just started looking.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.740
You will.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.671
Henry?

06:16.835 --> 06:19.714
Yes, I will catch him.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.649
I'm not a popular man,

06:31.933 --> 06:33.150
not that ii worries me.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.030
Anyone you're particularly unpopular with?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.907
The landlord wanted me out.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.988
The neighbors weren't exactly neighborly.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.994
I've let half a dozen employees go.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.277
Should I go on?

06:44.279 --> 06:45.201
Yes, please.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.535
I have time.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.042
All right.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.375
Take that dandy over there.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.460
He's a dreadful man.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.092
Mr. Milne left refuse in the lane.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.924
He'd stay in his store lo
all hours of the evening,

07:00.211 --> 07:02.805
make noise, loiter around,

07:03.089 --> 07:04.682
catcall women.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.684
From his place of business?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.471
Man like him, where else would he go?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.481
He doesn't have a friend in the world'

07:11.765 --> 07:15.144
No home to go to either, I've heard.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.062
And you've complained to the landlord

07:17.354 --> 07:18.196
about his behavior?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.521
We all did,

07:19.522 --> 07:21.240
not that ii did much good.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.323
Mr. Decker said that his hands were tied.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.113
I see.

07:26.404 --> 07:30.534
Does this mean that Milne
will be leaving the market?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.623
Well, the building is structurally unsound.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.539
I imagine it'll have to come down.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.753
What a shame.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.840
This is dreadful. Damned Milne.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.596
I've had this building
for more than ten years.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.258
I've never had a tenant like him.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.509
He probably caused this.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.597
I wouldn't be surprised

07:48.760 --> 07:50.280
if he had an illegal still in the back.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.437
I don't believe that's the case, sir.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.688
It was certainly an explosive device

07:52.973 --> 07:54.099
that caused the damage.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.018
Obviously you two weren't
on the best of terms, then.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.185
I wanted him out.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.444
That's no secret.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.854
But he would n'! Leave.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.523
Said he had an iron-clad lease.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.283
He's nothing but a damn nuisance.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.241
Mm, almost like a boil
that refuses to be lanced.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.247
<i>Mm.</i>

08:09.531 --> 08:12.330
Did he have any enemies, then, sin'?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.178
Anyone in his employ, I would imagine.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.121
Well, anyone else?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.791
The man that owned that establishment,

08:19.082 --> 08:20.299
Angus Trout.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.087
He had the bad fortune of being
in the same business as Milne.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.346
And?

08:25.630 --> 08:26.951
Milne drove him out of business,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.933
and poor Trout ended
up selling his inventory

08:29.175 --> 08:30.552
for pennies on the dollar.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.970
They had quite a set-to

08:32.261 --> 08:34.230
the day Trout finally
shuttered his windows.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.642
The constabulary were called.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.153
From time to time. Trout
comes by to hector Milne.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.436
Really'?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.313
And when was the last time this occurred?

08:42.605 --> 08:43.982
It was yesterday, I believe.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.242
I wasn't here, but it was
the talk of the street.

08:48.820 --> 08:49.912
He lost his whole shop?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.197
Yes, he did.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.867
His whole shop.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.332
Shame he wasn't in it at the time.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.247
A colleague of mine was almost
killed in that explosion,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.041
so just shut your mouth.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.299
George.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.133
Sir, I suggest you sober up
before you incriminate yourself.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.093
Sober up?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.599
This is the best day
I've had in a long time.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.729
Sir, I'm sorry for that outburst.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.012
Quite all right, George.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.357
It was justified.

09:20.852 --> 09:21.853
What's all this about'?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.067
I have no idea.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.480
Is this the man behind the bombing?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.334
- You're damn right.
- Quiet, Mr. Trout.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.485
- Step aside, people.
- Is he the traitor'?

09:28.777 --> 09:29.744
Why did you do if?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.245
You want to know who the criminal is?

09:31.529 --> 09:32.576
H's Peter Milne.

09:32.577 --> 09:34.165
Just let us pass.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.464
Mr. Trout in the interrogation room,

09:41.748 --> 09:43.500
please, George.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.551
And post a guard.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.716
Gentlemen, back to work.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.227
- So has he confessed?
- Hmm?

09:55.512 --> 09:57.435
Named any co-conspirators?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.019
Terrence Meyers.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.231
Murdoch.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.149
What might this have to do
with our esteemed government'?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.565
Who's the man, hmm?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.200
What's his name?

10:09.484 --> 10:11.327
His name is Angus Trout.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.659
He's a shopkeeper. I'm
questioning him regarding-

10:13.947 --> 10:16.325
- Oh, I'm well aware of what
you're questioning him about.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.540
The anarchist attack on Dunbar Market.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.830
Anarchists?

10:22.122 --> 10:25.422
That bombing was no simple
dispute between two shopkeepers.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.552
It was a first strike against us.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.180
<i>By whom'?</i>

10:30.463 --> 10:32.431
Anarchists, Murdoch.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.639
It would appear our country has
now joined the war on terror.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.112
You'll have to go a long way to convince me

10:46.229 --> 10:49.233
that Toronto is being
besieged by terrorists.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.242
<i>Hmm.</i>

10:51.526 --> 10:54.746
Why doesn't that surprise me?

10:55.029 --> 10:59.375
Gentlemen, lam privy to some
confidential information.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.629
Our government is currently
in high-level negotiations

11:02.912 --> 11:06.542
pertaining to a visit to Canada
by President William McKinley.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.843
Now, this would be
something of a coup for us,

11:10.128 --> 11:11.888
as it would be the first
trip to foreign soil

11:12.005 --> 11:13.678
by any American president.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.558
Oh, well, bully for him.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.765
I'll get the missus to make
him a nice steak and kidney pie

11:18.052 --> 11:20.726
with mushy peas on the side.

11:21.014 --> 11:21.981
Inspector Brackenreid,

11:22.265 --> 11:23.767
despite your opinions to the contrary,

11:24.058 --> 11:25.401
the Americans are an important,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.358
if somewhat unruly, ally of ours.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.365
And how does this involve the tribulations

11:29.606 --> 11:31.529
of an unpleasant shopkeeper'?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.409
Well. Ä°t speaks to the
maturity of the country,

11:33.693 --> 11:34.785
I suppose.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.430
The Americans are already convinced

11:36.613 --> 11:37.974
that our standards of law and order

11:38.072 --> 11:39.699
do not meet theirs.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.119
Damn Yankees.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.504
Who are they to talk about standards, eh?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.461
Or law and order, for that matter?

11:47.749 --> 11:49.422
They were the ones that
went to war with themselves.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.052
Like it or not, gentlemen,

11:51.336 --> 11:53.656
our government is committed
to being the first host country

11:53.671 --> 11:56.470
of an American president,
so we must be vigilant.

11:56.758 --> 11:57.725
We are vigilant.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.229
Really? Oh, good. Good, good, good.

12:01.512 --> 12:05.187
You must be keeping close tabs
on Emma Goldman, then, hmm?

12:05.475 --> 12:07.227
Who the bloody hell is Emma Goldman?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.441
Emma Goldman is a noted American anarchist

12:09.729 --> 12:10.901
and labor organizer.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.629
Who, according to reliable sources,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.533
is currently in Toronto.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.990
It is my opinion that she and her cohorts

12:17.278 --> 12:19.781
are the authors of the bombing
you are currently investigating.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.553
And do your sources suggest a reason

12:21.574 --> 12:25.249
why Miss Goldman would
bomb a shop on market day?

12:25.536 --> 12:28.665
Well, Milne's Fine Goods
appealed to an elite clientele.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.380
The bombing was an
affront against capitalism,

12:31.668 --> 12:33.670
the backbone of any free society.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.509
And they attacked more than a shop.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.219
Two of our own were injured.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.305
That may be a coincidence, sir.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.139
Has Miss Goldman or anyone in her group

12:41.427 --> 12:42.553
taken credit for the attack?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.725
Gentlemen, whatever the
reason for the attack,

12:44.806 --> 12:47.104
it is our duty to eliminate this scourge.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.894
It is our prime minister's opinion

12:49.185 --> 12:51.108
that the anarchist movement
is a threat to peace,

12:51.396 --> 12:53.194
order, and good government.

12:59.112 --> 12:59.954
I love my country.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.831
Not to worry, Mr. Trout.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.664
I doubt you have political
affiliations of any kind.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.750
Your only conviction
appears to be to the bottle

13:08.037 --> 13:08.959
and little else.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.249
- You haven't gone through what I have:

13:11.541 --> 13:13.919
A destroyed business, shattered marriage,

13:14.210 --> 13:17.180
watching my loyal customers walk in and out

13:17.463 --> 13:21.343
<i>of Milne's shop as I shuttered my windows.</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:22.955
The home's the most reliable thing

13:23.136 --> 13:24.763
I have left in the world.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.148
Mr. Trout, while you we're
watching those customers,

13:27.432 --> 13:29.901
did you happen to see anything suspicious?

13:30.184 --> 13:33.688
I saw Albert Wallace kick up a fuss.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.072
And he is?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.984
A clerk once in Milne's employ.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.075
Milne fired him three weeks ago.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.036
Well, I think the future of policing

13:44.324 --> 13:45.667
will be much like my field:

13:45.950 --> 13:48.373
Covert operations, subversion,

13:48.661 --> 13:52.711
prediction and prevention of
crime before it's committed.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.923
George, see if you can
locate a Mr. Albert Wallace,

13:56.210 --> 13:57.632
former employee of Mr. Milne's.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.046
He's a person of interest.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.135
<i>. Sir.</i>

14:00.423 --> 14:01.345
Good work, Murdoch.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.259
Is he affiliated with Emma Goldman?

14:03.551 --> 14:06.054
He's a store clerk.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.769
You mean he says he's a store clerk.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.277
These anarchists sound like Marxists to me.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.438
They share some philosophies, I think.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.528
Oh, that's what you call it, philosophy?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.409
I don't recall Socrates
running around blowing up shops.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.536
If I had my way, I'd
string up the lot of them.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.447
As long as they were guilty, I trust.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.958
Yes, of course.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.281
So do you think Meyers'
suspicions carry any weight?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.832
They might.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.124
The bomb and its construction
does share some similarities

14:34.415 --> 14:36.292
to the device used in the Haymarket attack

14:36.584 --> 14:38.382
in Chicago 13 years ago.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.842
Eight coppers died that day, didn't they?

14:41.130 --> 14:43.178
Brothers in arms, despite their lineage.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.137
Stay close to Meyers on this, Murdoch.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.351
This is still our investigation.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.959
I don't want him getting his
sticky little fingers into it.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.355
He already has, sir.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.860
Once Ottawa is involved-

14:55.144 --> 14:56.487
Yes, yes, I know, but...

14:56.771 --> 14:58.239
I don't want a cock-up.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.570
Sirs,

14:59.857 --> 15:01.859
Mr. Wallace is in the interview room.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.369
Why did Mr. Milne remove
you from his employ'?

15:07.657 --> 15:08.909
He withheld my wages,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.623
didn't pay me for days I had worked.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.289
I had the audacity to complain.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.923
Why would he do that'?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.800
Because he's a heartless capitalist.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.337
He routinely cheated his employees.

15:20.628 --> 15:24.178
I wasn't the first man he
fired for speaking his mind.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.684
Your politics betray you, sir.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.436
What do you mean by that?

15:28.719 --> 15:31.268
You're aware that Emma
Goldman is currently-

15:32.849 --> 15:34.476
An anarchist.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.144
You think I'm an anarchist.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.152
Are you?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.317
Oh, hardly.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.658
The anarchists are nothing more
than disorganized idealists.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.825
I am an adherent of Karl Marx.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.914
Oh, I see.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.546
Anarchy is an unworkable political theory.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.834
It's a thimbleful of intellectual ideas

15:59.125 --> 16:01.469
drowning in a bucket of naiveté.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.675
Do you think society could function

16:03.963 --> 16:06.261
without some mechanism of control?

16:07.717 --> 16:08.513
Mr. Wallace,

16:08.801 --> 16:10.849
I'm not here to debate
political theory with you.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.641
I'm here to ask about your
involvement with Mr. Milne.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.152
Milne treated his workers like dogs,

16:18.436 --> 16:19.688
worse than dogs.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.980
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:21.272 --> 16:23.650
And where were you when his
establishment was bombed?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.033
There's a suggestion

16:28.321 --> 16:30.540
that the bombing was a staged event

16:30.823 --> 16:34.168
perpetrated by the anarchist movement.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.045
Are they trying to lake credit for if?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.455
There's been talk.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.920
The anarchists? They said they did it?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.882
- Oh, I'm not saying- -
Well, they didn't do it.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.092
I did it.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.883
I placed the device for the revolution,

16:49.175 --> 16:50.848
the workers' revolution.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.012
Are you admitting your guilt, sin'?

16:53.304 --> 16:55.022
Yes, sir.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.647
Right, then.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.438
Where in the establishment
was the bomb placed?

17:01.729 --> 17:03.731
Near the cash register.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.945
Mm. And the bomb's composition?

17:06.233 --> 17:07.394
<i>It was supplied to me. I...</i>

17:07.609 --> 17:10.079
And the method of detonation?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.786
I lit... the fuse?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.750
A moment, Detective.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.414
I would appreciate being notified

17:19.704 --> 17:21.799
next time you intend to
monitor my interrogations.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.130
You had a confession.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.089
A false one. He's innocent.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.880
You argued him out of his guilt.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.390
Because he isn't guilty,
and he should be released.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.553
You can read minds now, can you?

17:32.843 --> 17:37.189
Sir, Albert Wallace has
been arrested several times.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.350
He's an attention seeker, publicity hound,

17:39.642 --> 17:41.394
trying to become a martyr.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.859
The man uttered a false confession.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.150
I want him charged with obstruction.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.864
Well that certainly is an
improvement, Chief Constable.

17:50.152 --> 17:50.994
At least this time,

17:51.279 --> 17:53.281
you've manufactured a viable charge.

17:53.573 --> 17:57.749
You walk a fine line, Detective Murdoch.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.663
Mind you don't stumble on it.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.875
There's talk of a
demonstration on Liberty Street

18:02.915 --> 18:03.837
tomorrow afternoon.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.877
Emma Goldman is planning to speak

18:06.168 --> 18:09.092
I want her arrested at
the slightest provocation.

18:11.591 --> 18:16.392
I believe your Constable
Higgins is still in hospital.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.110
The bastards responsible are going to pay.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.818
I trust that sentiment is
shared by all at this station.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.028
Oh, yes, of course,

18:28.316 --> 18:31.866
as long as those we make
pay are actually guilty.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.000
'We pushed open the door
to the tomb of the pharaohs

18:41.287 --> 18:43.289
"and choked on the dust of the ancients."

18:43.581 --> 18:45.925
'What we saw when our
eyes adjusted to the light

18:46.208 --> 18:48.381
"was a most horrific sight."

18:48.669 --> 18:50.387
'The mummy's tomb had been opened,

18:50.671 --> 18:52.844
"and the poor unfortunate
was lying on the ground"

18:53.132 --> 18:55.009
â€œfor all the world to see,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.395
"swaddled in rags that were once regal"

18:57.678 --> 19:01.899
"but were now despoiled
by the cruel hand of time."

19:02.183 --> 19:04.311
"As we moved deeper into the crypt,"

19:04.602 --> 19:06.229
'We began to realize

19:06.520 --> 19:08.443
"that we were not in the grave alone.

19:08.731 --> 19:12.952
There was a pair of hideous
yellow eyes gazing upon us."

19:16.697 --> 19:19.166
We'll pick it up from
there tomorrow, Henry.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.883
You're going to want to
be awake for the ending.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.938
Wonderful news, isn't it?

19:41.222 --> 19:42.348
What's that?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.857
The demonstration, man.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.108
Come on, look sharp.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.519
This could well be the
break we've been waiting for.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.813
Could you be a bit clearer?

19:50.231 --> 19:51.403
Just follow me, Murdoch.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.052
Come on, I've got an idea. Come on.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.707
Too formal, sir, and a bit too tidy.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.031
Could you not find a shirt

20:02.201 --> 20:03.953
with frayed cuffs or a dirty collar?

20:04.245 --> 20:06.998
Or perhaps a dustman's cap,
sir, to cover your nice hair.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.132
Mm-hmm.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.897
And what about me, Constable Crabtree?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.298
Do I, uh, pass muster'?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.429
Oh, sir, you look like a regular ragman.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.432
- No offense.
- Excellent.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.844
May I ask the reason
for all this subterfuge?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.216
Mr. Meyers seems to think

20:20.302 --> 20:22.896
that this is a worthwhile
avenue of investigation.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.021
We will infiltrate this
criminal organization

20:25.224 --> 20:26.771
and cut off its head, hmm?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.380
We'll beat them at their own game.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.112
Let's go, Murdoch.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.692
George, I need you to stick to the task

20:34.984 --> 20:37.783
in case Mr. Meyers'
speculations are wrongheaded.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.196
If I find anything?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.240
Use your initiative.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.544
So I'm assuming you didn't
have anything to do with it.

20:48.831 --> 20:49.832
<i>Nah.</i>

20:52.418 --> 20:53.510
So were you hurt in the explosion?

20:53.794 --> 20:56.547
- Sorry, sir.
- I was.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.557
- See this?
- Oh, dear!

20:58.841 --> 21:01.685
So you had very few dealings
with Mr. Milne personally.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.138
How are you?

21:09.852 --> 21:10.853
Thanks.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.985
And what brings you down here?

21:27.203 --> 21:28.580
Hello, Constable Crabtree.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.873
Hold you this is dangerous business.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.418
I'm simply a private
citizen doing my shopping.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.881
<i>Ah.</i>

21:35.169 --> 21:37.388
May I join you, Constable?

21:37.671 --> 21:40.766
I promise not to get in the way.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.552
Just mind yourself.

21:42.843 --> 21:43.810
Thank you.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.254
So what shall we investigate?

21:45.471 --> 21:47.064
- You mean who.
- Of course.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.646
You see, Detective Murdoch
focuses on physical evidence.

21:49.934 --> 21:50.810
I prefer to explore

21:51.101 --> 21:52.541
the inner workings of the human mind.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.610
<i>That's why he and I...</i>

21:54.897 --> 21:56.740
make such a good team.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.582
And who are these men who
call themselves our leaders?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.242
I'll tell you who.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.753
Men no better than any of you.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.880
Yet they conduct themselves
like they are royalty,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.758
and they treat us as if we were children,

22:15.042 --> 22:18.046
incapable of making our own decisions.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.806
I reject the idea of government,

22:21.090 --> 22:23.639
either for the people or by the people,

22:23.926 --> 22:26.475
as strongly as I reject
the idea of monarchy.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.605
- Listen to her.
- Strong words, indeed.

22:28.889 --> 22:32.018
These men, this government

22:32.309 --> 22:34.482
is nothing more than an arrangement

22:34.770 --> 22:38.274
between the ruling elite and
the powers of industrialists

22:38.566 --> 22:40.284
to keep you and me in chains!

22:40.568 --> 22:41.808
Do I have to give the order'?

22:42.027 --> 22:44.826
All of you know how to
conduct your own affairs,

22:45.114 --> 22:47.993
keep your own counsel,
make your own decisions.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.661
You are not cattle.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.080
<i>Don't allow yourselves
to be treated as such!</i>

22:54.081 --> 22:55.924
We need to smash the chains that bind us.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.289
All right, that's enough.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.673
That's enough.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.634
All right, lads, break this up.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.843
<i>Come on, move it.</i>

23:02.131 --> 23:03.383
I said move it!

23:06.218 --> 23:08.937
Nothing to see. Move along. Move along.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.974
Come on, Move along. Move along.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.266
Come on. Let's do this.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.486
- Hurry,
- We have to go.

23:15.769 --> 23:19.069
We have to go. We have
to go. Come on, this way.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.357
Go on.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.117
Keep alert, Murdoch.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.411
We're inside the belly of the beast.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.546
Emma, are you all right?

23:38.834 --> 23:40.006
They charged us

23:40.294 --> 23:42.046
right in the middle of my speech.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.738
They don't want to hear the truth.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.757
They just want to oppress
the voice of the people.

23:45.799 --> 23:46.800
Even in Canada?

23:47.092 --> 23:49.220
Especially in Canada.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.832
Miss Goldman, are you all right?

23:51.096 --> 23:52.473
Yes, I'm all right.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.925
I'll make you a cup of tea.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.693
You do that.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.729
I'll get you something stronger.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.657
Ii you're approached by this man...

24:05.945 --> 24:07.743
His name is Turner. He's
a reporter for the Gazette.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.408
Reporter,

24:10.699 --> 24:11.575
His real name is-

24:11.867 --> 24:13.585
Allen Clegg.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.001
. Mr. Clegg-

24:20.292 --> 24:23.171
- I'm on official American
government business,

24:23.462 --> 24:25.430
so stay out of my way.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.599
Mr. Clegg, what are you doing here?

24:34.890 --> 24:36.187
The same thing you are:

24:36.475 --> 24:37.692
Ä°nfiltrating this vermin.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.497
We need to find out what they're up to.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.568
And what are they up to?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.152
Fomenting dissent.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.193
Were any of these people
involved in the market bombing?

24:46.485 --> 24:47.484
I don't know.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.453
Miss Goldman wasn't,

24:48.737 --> 24:50.377
but I can't speak for the Toronto faction.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.457
But I do know what these
types are capable of.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.617
These types?

24:53.909 --> 24:55.536
You remember Haymarket.

24:55.828 --> 24:56.954
Chicago. Illinois.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.749
Eight dead officers of
the law, men like yourself.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.293
What everyone neglects to
mention about Haymarket is,

25:02.584 --> 25:03.881
those eight dead police officers

25:04.169 --> 25:06.388
were accidentally shot by their fellow men.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.552
At an event where the
anarchists lit the fuse.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.097
They still died doing their duty.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.480
You best not do anything to expose me.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.058
One question, Mr. Clegg.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.309
How is it that you are
here without the invitation

25:19.518 --> 25:20.735
of the Canadian Government'?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.863
We don't need Canadian permission.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.107
You most certainly do-

25:24.273 --> 25:25.445
Shh!

25:25.733 --> 25:27.213
My government was granted permission

25:27.443 --> 25:30.071
to cross your border by
the British Foreign Office.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.332
I believe their authority exceeds yours.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.992
Excuse me.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.838
Damn high hat.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.098
I don't trust any of them.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.424
Anarchists?

25:51.425 --> 25:52.642
Americans.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.598
Bloody hell.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.267
It's what I saw, sir.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.078
Both Agent Meyers and Detective Murdoch

26:01.268 --> 26:02.565
were swept up in the crowd.

26:02.853 --> 26:03.945
And then you lost them?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.981
That I did.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.713
Has there been any word on Higgins?

26:07.858 --> 26:09.030
Some good news, sir.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.821
Couple of the boys went
down to pay their respects,

26:12.112 --> 26:13.989
had a short chat with him.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.079
He's drifting in and out of consciousness.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.287
But he's on the mend?

26:17.451 --> 26:18.418
It would appear so.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.454
Good, good.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.965
Hey, you!

26:23.248 --> 26:24.591
Capped.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.259
Shouldn't you be out chasing the terrorist

26:29.546 --> 26:30.867
that did this to my establishment?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.470
The investigation is ongoing, sir.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.101
Yes, I can see it is.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.603
Although how you will be
able to apprehend anyone

26:36.887 --> 26:38.847
while taking a stroll with
a trollop is beyond me.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.371
- Sir, I'll advise
you to- - Trollop?

26:40.516 --> 26:41.859
I do not know who you
think you are talking to.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.359
Doctor, please, it's quite all right.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.942
She's a doctor, Now haven'! I seen it all?

26:46.230 --> 26:47.231
Sir, you are about to see a lot more.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.365
That's quite enough from both of you.

26:48.649 --> 26:49.970
Dr. Grace, over here, if you will.

26:50.025 --> 26:50.992
And, you, I advise you

26:51.276 --> 26:52.837
to mind your manners in the future, sir.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.787
Do you often handle abuse of that sort'?

26:58.075 --> 27:00.077
As a policeman, we often need to suffer

27:00.369 --> 27:03.543
the slings and arrows of the discontented.

27:03.831 --> 27:07.131
So what do you know about
these supposed anarchists?

27:07.417 --> 27:08.839
Not a great deal.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.426
They seem a dastardly lot, though.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.465
Do you know they practice free love?

27:13.757 --> 27:14.756
Huh?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.010
Consider that

27:16.301 --> 27:18.804
the feeling of being
able to do what you want,

27:19.096 --> 27:21.849
free of all society's constraints.

27:22.141 --> 27:26.021
I imagine that would take
a degree of self-confidence.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.733
<i>What would you do...</i>

27:29.815 --> 27:31.095
If there was no-one in authority

27:31.358 --> 27:33.781
to tell you what was or wasn't proper?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.321
On, I-

27:35.612 --> 27:36.738
I'm an officer of the law, Dr. Grace.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.202
I don't think in such terms.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.616
Certainly.

27:39.908 --> 27:40.909
But as a writer,

27:41.201 --> 27:42.681
I would have thought you in possession

27:42.744 --> 27:44.746
of a more daring soul.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.886
They call themselves the Apaches.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.422
Who? Who does?

27:52.713 --> 27:55.057
The French avant garde.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.763
Their music is so progressive.

27:58.051 --> 28:01.931
It lakes you to the most sensual places.

28:02.222 --> 28:06.147
Before you even know
it, your body is moving,

28:06.435 --> 28:08.278
undulating,

28:08.562 --> 28:10.690
writhing.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.489
Go on.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.528
It's hard to explain.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.322
<i>You should come with me sometime.</i>

28:18.614 --> 28:19.774
There's a group from New York

28:19.865 --> 28:21.708
that comes here from time to time.

28:21.992 --> 28:22.952
Really? Where is this?

28:23.076 --> 28:24.544
<i>At Massey Hall or...</i>

28:24.828 --> 28:27.627
Hardly.

28:27.915 --> 28:32.216
They play in dark, mysterious places.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.503
<i>Mm.</i>

28:35.964 --> 28:39.184
I agree with Nellie Bly
from The New York World.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.266
You're a modern Joan of Arc.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.146
Oh, Mr. Pierce, really.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.274
Your followers in
Toronto, especially myself,

28:46.558 --> 28:47.901
are honored you're here.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.778
To listen to you speak,

28:50.062 --> 28:52.440
ifs as if you wield the sword of truth'

28:52.731 --> 28:54.654
I tell Emma that sometimes
she needs to wield something

28:54.942 --> 28:56.444
stronger than just mere words.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.328
The police come at us, all we do is run.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.080
You're a firebrand, Alec.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.708
Well, what good are words
when they fall on deaf ears?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.459
Sometimes raw power is the only thing

29:04.743 --> 29:05.835
people will listen to.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.120
And sometimes violence

29:07.412 --> 29:09.380
only serves to obscure the message.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.633
And who are you, sir?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.545
Another admirer, Miss Goldman.

29:14.836 --> 29:15.803
He was at the rally.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.608
He and his friend were almost arrested.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.806
They needed help.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.890
And what do you think?

29:22.177 --> 29:24.475
Words are the only weapons that matter.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.436
Are you a pacifist'?

29:28.725 --> 29:32.320
Well, I won't strike first,
but I'll certainly strike back.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.981
Then you're on our side.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.514
The government's been striking
the common man repeatedly.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.055
All we're doing is fighting back.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.631
A fist in the face deserves two back

29:39.778 --> 29:40.779
does it not, Mr. Clegg?

29:41.071 --> 29:42.163
You're damn right.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.543
Madam, if you wish lo
try on the merchandise,

29:50.831 --> 29:52.833
please consult me.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.002
Sorry, sir.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.637
I couldn't help but notice

29:56.920 --> 29:57.921
the destruction across the street.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.294
Was your building affected?

29:59.423 --> 30:00.640
Thankfully, no.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.164
Have they caught the culprits?

30:02.175 --> 30:04.052
Not as far as I know.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.812
You must be a brave man.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.848
Aren't you worried about future attacks?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.984
Of course not.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.737
Constable!

30:14.021 --> 30:15.523
How can I help you?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.534
Actually, sir, I was wondering if I could-

30:17.566 --> 30:19.864
Here.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.779
Try this.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.949
Actually, sir, that's my on-duty helmet.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.537
<i>I'm required to...</i>

30:26.825 --> 30:28.827
Well, doesn't that look smashing?

30:29.119 --> 30:30.040
Yes, indeed, ii does.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.087
I'm sure I couldn't afford it, though.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.372
Of course you could.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.881
I am having a moving sale.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.133
Three weeks from now,

30:35.417 --> 30:36.778
Chez Lyon will be in a much grander

30:36.960 --> 30:39.713
and much safer place of business.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.851
Perhaps you'd like to
attend our opening soiree.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.266
What were you doing there?

30:47.267 --> 30:48.388
I was trying to determine

30:48.680 --> 30:49.960
if he had any useful information.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.358
That's my job, not yours.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.769
What's so funny')

30:54.061 --> 30:55.438
Perhaps ii was that fiery temper

30:55.729 --> 30:57.026
that attracted Mr. Green.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.190
Excuse me?

30:58.482 --> 30:59.825
The owner of the hat shop.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.863
He was immune to my charms
but certainly not to yours.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.620
<i>That was quite a commotion,</i>

31:07.908 --> 31:09.285
the market bombing.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.123
<i>It was.</i>

31:11.411 --> 31:13.880
Was it a brave man or a coward who did it?

31:14.164 --> 31:15.837
I don't think I would know.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.842
Is he among us?

31:18.126 --> 31:20.254
I really have no idea.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.172
But I can understand the anger.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.091
When the government won't listen,

31:24.383 --> 31:26.056
a reaction is inevitable.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.471
Fortunately, I don't want
to change the government.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.561
I just want the day
when it no longer exists.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.601
That's an ideal I can't
pretend to understand.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.816
Then why are you here?

31:37.104 --> 31:39.402
Miss Goldman has some very good ideas.

31:39.689 --> 31:40.690
She certainly does.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.404
Although I can'! Pretend

31:42.692 --> 31:44.569
to share her faith in my fellow man.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.034
When government makes men's decisions,

31:47.322 --> 31:48.842
tells them what they can and cannot do,

31:49.116 --> 31:51.210
then how can we ever
know the true potential

31:51.493 --> 31:56.624
of what people-not just
men- are capable of?

31:56.915 --> 32:01.216
People are capable of good
and evil in equal measure.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.801
Unfortunately, that much is true.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.181
I spoke to a contact of mine
at the Municipal Records Office.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.015
Part of good policing, Dr. Grace,

32:10.303 --> 32:12.055
is to build a network of sources.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.027
And she told me something very interesting.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.694
She?

32:17.978 --> 32:21.027
Well, it's good- uh,
having a network of-

32:21.314 --> 32:22.782
is good for a variety of things.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.660
Our hat shop owner will be
disappointed to hear that.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.239
It appears that Mr. Green

32:29.531 --> 32:31.124
is moving into a new establishment.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.705
Didn't we know that already?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.586
Yes, but what we didn't
know is that the building

32:34.870 --> 32:36.998
into which he is moving is
owned by Mr. Howard Decker.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.212
Now, he's the chap who
owned the block of stores

32:39.499 --> 32:40.842
that Mr. Milne's shop was in.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.218
And what does that mean?

32:42.502 --> 32:44.550
Well, it's an interesting coincidence.

32:47.424 --> 32:51.054
So what should we do with
this, Constable Crabtree?

32:51.344 --> 32:52.687
Well, I'll submit these findings

32:52.971 --> 32:54.723
to Detective Murdoch, of course.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.608
Of course.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.610
Well. What would you have me do?

32:58.894 --> 33:01.022
He who hesitates is lost, George,

33:01.313 --> 33:02.713
but I would imagine if you were able

33:02.981 --> 33:04.733
to solve this puzzle on your own,

33:05.025 --> 33:06.823
it would look good on you.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.167
Anarcho-syndicalism
is a workable approach.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.049
<i>It treads a similar
path as Marxism, I fear.</i>

33:21.333 --> 33:23.711
It's no more than a
refinement of trade unionism.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.299
Whatever you're saying...

33:25.587 --> 33:27.430
These people are harmless.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.842
They're just intellectuals.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.388
Those are the ones I worry about the most.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.733
Intellectuals are the
most dangerous of all.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.189
They're just young people

33:40.477 --> 33:42.855
with their hearts in the right place,

33:43.146 --> 33:45.695
even if their minds aren't.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.235
Have you seen Agent Clegg?

33:48.527 --> 33:49.619
I haven't, actually.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.200
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

33:51.488 --> 33:55.083
all of this anarchist threat
is merely American paranoia.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.968
Don't you read the newspapers, Murdoch?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.878
These people are dangerous.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.755
Anarchism is a worldwide movement

34:01.039 --> 34:04.213
that wants nothing more than
to topple our civilization.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.970
Well, I don't think these
people are part of it.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.348
What happened?

34:14.636 --> 34:16.855
Sure you wouldn't like to
reconsider your assessment'?

34:33.655 --> 34:36.078
Bastards got what they deserved.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.666
Push me into the wall.

34:40.954 --> 34:41.750
What'?

34:42.038 --> 34:43.460
Inspector, shove me.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.920
Come here!

34:47.668 --> 34:48.761
I need to talk to you.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.422
About what'?

34:50.714 --> 34:52.306
Shut up!

34:52.591 --> 34:53.717
Allen Clegg, sir.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.806
The American agent'? What about him?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.597
I said shut up!

34:58.888 --> 35:00.515
He's also infiltrated the anarchists.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.356
I've been keeping my eye on him.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.361
He wasn't with us when this bomb went off.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.397
Do you think Clegg's got
something to do with this?

35:07.689 --> 35:09.612
I don't know, sir, but
you need to find out.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.526
Away you go, you scoundrel!

35:11.818 --> 35:14.162
And you're lucky I don't
throw your ass in jail!

35:19.534 --> 35:21.286
I hear you've released Wallace.

35:21.578 --> 35:22.921
Bloody communist.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.084
I don't fancy feeding
him any more free lunches.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.249
<i>Mm.</i>

35:26.541 --> 35:28.181
Have you heard anything from Murdoch yet'?

35:28.293 --> 35:30.170
- No.
- Undercover.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.511
<i>I must say, I admire the man's initiative.</i>

35:33.798 --> 35:35.926
Well, what do you think, Brackenreid?

35:36.217 --> 35:38.265
Well, two distinct bombs, sir.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.271
Could mean two distinct bombers.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.978
So is Murdoch barking up the wrong tree?

35:43.266 --> 35:45.018
We don't know that yet.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.562
<i>Hmm.</i>

35:46.853 --> 35:49.606
You know, you should lay
charges against that policeman.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.275
I would have come to your aid,

35:51.566 --> 35:53.568
but I was injured myself earlier.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.237
I got struck by a truncheon.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.745
Are you all right?

35:57.030 --> 35:58.202
I'm not sure, actually.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.616
Here.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.046
Could I have a word with you, Mr. Clegg?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.761
Where were you at the
time of the explosion?

36:10.043 --> 36:12.421
That's classified.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.714
Mr. Clegg, of everyone here,

36:15.006 --> 36:16.646
you're the one who stands to gain the most

36:16.716 --> 36:18.138
if violence were to break out.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.770
You're walking on very
thin ice here, Murdoch.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.431
As are you.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.396
One word from me, and your cover is blown.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.062
If you interfere with my mission, I'll-

36:29.104 --> 36:30.196
Are you all right?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.732
Did you see?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.196
Two sticks of dynamite
makes a hell of a bang.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.451
You didn't.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.907
Yes, the factory where you were speaking.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.538
What were you thinking?

36:38.822 --> 36:40.449
They won't even let me speak freely.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.912
What do you think happens from now on?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.452
Now they will listen.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.503
Now they will see we're
serious about change.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.629
No, now they will hunt us all down,

36:46.913 --> 36:47.789
put us behind bars.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.207
Thai was stupid!

36:49.499 --> 36:50.751
Was anyone killed or injured?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.009
Not that I know of.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.920
Well, at least that's something.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.805
Violence will not help our cause.

36:56.089 --> 36:58.262
Not here, not now!

36:59.426 --> 37:01.546
You did the right thing.
She's just being emotional.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.595
Come on.

37:07.517 --> 37:08.643
I have to get out of here.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.858
That man knows me.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.944
I'll handle it.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.733
Hey, who are you?

37:15.024 --> 37:18.119
Albert Wallace, communist.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.371
But I'm here to join the cause.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.958
Any news, George?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.589
Mr. Decker's building has
been slated for demolition.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.716
Shame it wasn't a bigger explosion, then.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.520
<i>The explosion hospitalized my friend.</i>

37:33.710 --> 37:35.303
It was plenty big enough.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.383
I'm sorry.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.469
That was a foolish thing to say.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.266
Dr. Grace, look at this.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.976
There are numerous
lawsuits against Mr. Decker,

37:46.264 --> 37:48.642
all filed by Peter Milne.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.527
It would appear that Mr. Milne
had no intention of moving.

37:51.811 --> 37:54.155
So Mr. Decker felt compelled
to force him to leave?

37:54.439 --> 37:55.861
But why would he destroy his own building?

37:56.149 --> 37:58.109
Perhaps there were bigger
rewards for Mr. Decker

37:58.151 --> 37:59.778
with his building demolished.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.992
And the explosion outside the factory')

38:02.280 --> 38:04.783
I've yet to determine how
he might benefit from that.

38:05.074 --> 38:05.996
A distraction, perhaps.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.536
<i>Mm.</i>

38:07.827 --> 38:09.750
Make sure you keep Pierce here.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.585
Got it.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.375
You!

38:13.666 --> 38:16.795
That man there. He's a police officer.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.086
He's right. He's right!

38:18.296 --> 38:19.923
There's a snake in our midst!

38:20.215 --> 38:21.432
Toronto Constabulary.

38:21.716 --> 38:22.956
Mr. Pierce, you're under arrest.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.056
Let go of him.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.624
Let the officer take him, Emma.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.812
Don't get involved.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.417
You're too important to the cause.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.975
Help me.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.313
I can't.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.487
You stand by your earlier statement?

38:41.778 --> 38:42.825
I do.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.910
I bombed the factory.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.784
People could have been killed.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.249
People are always killed.

38:50.537 --> 38:53.882
Governments send men into war
without regard to their safety.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.338
They take no responsibility for our lives.

38:56.626 --> 38:58.173
Why should I for theirs?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.887
University of Toronto, King's College.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.892
You were an intelligent young man.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.430
I am an intelligent young man.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.064
Then why do this?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.975
For Emma.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.610
She's turned her back on you.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.270
She'll help me.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.235
I know she will.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.774
I am a soldier.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.186
I know she will come for me.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.860
<i>No.</i>

39:22.151 --> 39:23.323
No, she won't.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.114
This is your crime and yours alone.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.083
What will happen to me?

39:29.367 --> 39:30.960
Two bombings.

39:31.244 --> 39:33.918
You'll likely spend a great
deal of time behind bars.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.798
I didn't do the first one, I swear-

39:36.082 --> 39:38.176
only the second.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.086
Who did the first bombing?

39:40.378 --> 39:42.881
I don't know. I honestly don't know.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.928
He told me ii would impress her.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.517
Who told you that?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.398
. Mr. Clegg-

39:52.682 --> 39:54.762
- So is it possible, then,
that Clegg was responsible

39:54.851 --> 39:56.103
for the first bombing?

39:56.394 --> 39:57.987
I wouldn't put it past him.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.818
<i>. Sirs.</i>

40:00.106 --> 40:01.707
What is it, Constable? We're busy here.

40:01.774 --> 40:02.946
Go ahead, George.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.795
I've discovered something at City Hall

40:04.819 --> 40:06.241
that I believe is of interest.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.281
Uh-huh. So what is it'?

40:08.573 --> 40:09.745
Well, pardon me, sir,

40:10.033 --> 40:11.751
but this is for Detective Murdoch.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.966
Well. This is very interesting, George.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.502
I thought so too, sir.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.630
What's amusing?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.220
The anarchists may have
been right all along.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.679
I'm sorry, sir'?

40:27.967 --> 40:30.766
It appears you've stumbled
onto a capitalist plot.

40:49.864 --> 40:50.911
What is it, George?

40:51.199 --> 40:52.320
I've prepared the evidence

40:52.533 --> 40:54.173
for your interrogation of Mr. Decker, sir.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.409
<i>Ah.</i>

40:55.411 --> 40:56.663
I won't be needing it.

40:56.955 --> 40:57.797
<i>Sin.</i>

40:58.081 --> 40:58.923
You'll be doing it, George.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.709
<i>" Me'? ' Why-Yes,."</i>

41:01.000 --> 41:02.280
You've gotten the case this far.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.920
See it through to its conclusion.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.259
Are you certain, sir?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.890
Mm-hmm.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.551
Yes.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.710
Sir, do you have any pointers
you'd care to share with me,

41:15.807 --> 41:19.687
tricks of the trade, as it were'?

41:19.978 --> 41:22.652
Let him know with all assurance

41:22.939 --> 41:24.987
that you think him guilty.

41:27.151 --> 41:30.405
Well, do you, George, think he's guilty'?

41:30.697 --> 41:32.950
What do you feel in your gut'?

41:33.241 --> 41:34.709
I believe he did it, sir.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.122
Then ifs his job to convince you otherwise.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.047
Off you go, George.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.462
I am a busy man.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.177
I will try to be brief.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.139
Does this look familiar?

41:52.427 --> 41:53.644
I can't say that it does.

41:53.928 --> 41:54.804
That's curious.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.143
This pipe was manufactured

41:56.431 --> 41:57.933
by a company you own in Hamilton.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.318
I'm not familiar with
the day-today operations

42:00.601 --> 42:01.397
of all my holdings.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.812
Yes, of course not.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.905
A man of your station
would hardly be familiar

42:04.939 --> 42:05.819
with the nitty-gritty.

42:06.065 --> 42:08.318
I should think not. I have interests...

42:08.609 --> 42:09.485
Dr. Grace.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.451
Detective Murdoch.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.458
Just seeing how George is doing.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.369
George?

42:17.660 --> 42:19.140
Would you be surprised if I told you

42:19.412 --> 42:21.665
that this pipe was one of
the components used in a bomb

42:21.956 --> 42:23.996
that was built to destroy
Mr. Milne's establishment?

42:24.167 --> 42:25.127
You're not suggesting-

42:25.251 --> 42:27.174
Suggesting what, sir?

42:27.462 --> 42:30.591
While it may be Milne's
store, he is merely a tenant.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.509
I wouldn't blow up my own building.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.926
Really'?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.738
Because according to Municipal Records,

42:36.012 --> 42:38.811
your building has been slated
for demolition for some time.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.226
Unfortunately for you,
proceedings were being held up

42:41.517 --> 42:43.440
by a number of legal
briefs signed by Mr. Milne.

42:43.728 --> 42:44.854
He was a nuisance.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.147
He would be gone by the end of the year.

42:46.439 --> 42:47.531
I could wait.

42:47.815 --> 42:49.176
No, I don't think you could, sir.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.485
This is an agreement of sale.

42:50.777 --> 42:52.029
Do you recognize it'?

42:53.988 --> 42:55.365
<i>No.</i>

42:55.656 --> 42:56.748
That is a bald-faced lie.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.513
This is an agreement to sell your land

42:58.576 --> 42:59.623
to the Dominion Bank.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.754
They offered you well above market value

43:02.038 --> 43:03.381
to secure your properly.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.505
It was to be the site
of their new head office.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.838
Do you deny that'?

43:07.126 --> 43:08.628
Uh...

43:09.629 --> 43:10.551
Go on, George.

43:10.838 --> 43:11.760
This sale was about to expire.

43:12.048 --> 43:13.675
You knew Milne's refusal to leave

43:13.966 --> 43:15.138
would scotch the deal.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.770
Hence, you lanced the boil.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.271
Do you deny that'?

43:36.906 --> 43:38.186
Good bit of detecting, George.

43:38.241 --> 43:39.584
Thank you, sir.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.082
Higgins!

43:46.374 --> 43:47.500
Good to see you, Henry.

43:47.792 --> 43:48.634
How are you faring'?

43:48.918 --> 43:49.965
I'm well, George.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.213
I must admit, my faculties
are somewhat scrambled.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.640
Back to normal, then?

43:54.924 --> 43:56.324
It was a real page-turner, George.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.514
What's that?

43:57.802 --> 43:59.270
Before the explosion, I was gonna tell you.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.726
I found your book to
be a real page-turner.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.515
Kept me up all night.

44:02.807 --> 44:03.979
Well, thank you, Henry.

44:04.267 --> 44:05.507
You should start another one.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.642
You know, I think I will.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.645
The muse has struck me.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.564
I'm thinking of a female detective

44:09.856 --> 44:13.076
who's wise in the ways
of post-mortem science.

44:16.112 --> 44:17.072
Have you heard the news?

44:17.196 --> 44:18.368
What news?

44:18.656 --> 44:19.936
Michael Decker will be spending

44:20.158 --> 44:21.410
a long time behind bars.

44:21.701 --> 44:22.543
I saw.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.079
You saw?

44:24.370 --> 44:27.089
You were watching me?

44:27.373 --> 44:30.252
I passed by while you were conducting

44:30.543 --> 44:31.510
your interrogation.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.796
I may have glanced in.

44:36.132 --> 44:39.306
You presented yourself quite forcefully.

44:39.594 --> 44:40.594
Well, Mr. Decker's bomb

44:40.761 --> 44:42.201
nearly cost my friend Henry his life.

44:42.471 --> 44:43.472
How is he faring?

44:43.764 --> 44:45.607
Well, thank you.

44:45.892 --> 44:49.692
And thank you, Dr. Grace,
for your stalwart support.

44:49.979 --> 44:51.447
Oh, that's not necessary, George.

44:53.733 --> 44:55.986
That's if you don't
mind me calling you that.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.947
That would be fine, Dr. Grace.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.410
Emily.

45:00.698 --> 45:01.540
Excuse me?

45:01.824 --> 45:02.916
My name is Emily.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.669
Rival.

45:04.952 --> 45:05.874
Excuse me?

45:06.162 --> 45:07.562
The name, "Emily," it means rival.

45:07.830 --> 45:10.629
It does. It also means to excel.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.510
- Well, that certainly pertains to you:

45:12.793 --> 45:14.793
A female becoming a doctor
and at such a young age.

45:14.921 --> 45:16.889
Hardly matches putting
a criminal behind bars.

45:17.173 --> 45:18.800
Yes, no, I suppose not.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.054
Well, I should go.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.269
Good day.

45:25.556 --> 45:26.933
I must say,

45:27.225 --> 45:29.819
lam pleased that you have gained a measure

45:30.102 --> 45:31.729
of self-confidence.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.207
Bidding us farewell. Mr. Clegg?

45:43.491 --> 45:44.834
I could help with your bags.

45:45.117 --> 45:46.869
I don't appreciate your tone.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.522
I highly doubt the second bombing

45:48.704 --> 45:50.545
would have occurred
without your encouragement.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.716
Ah, yes, the all-powerful word.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.160
Young Mr. Pierce will spend

45:54.252 --> 45:55.532
the rest of his days behind bars.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.092
I hold you responsible.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.223
I don't give a devil what
you hold me responsible for.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.180
<i>I've done my duly.</i>

46:01.467 --> 46:03.140
The American State Department

46:03.427 --> 46:05.725
has canceled President McKinley's visit.

46:07.807 --> 46:08.608
Let's go, Mr. Clegg.

46:08.891 --> 46:09.938
Of course.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.024
Land my new lady friend, Emma Goldman,

46:12.311 --> 46:13.483
have a train to catch.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.332
It'll be a damn long time before you see

46:15.523 --> 46:17.696
an American president on foreign soil.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.657
We'll keep our own safe, thank you.

46:19.944 --> 46:23.915
It's my feeling you make your own problems.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.200
We're God's own country,

46:26.492 --> 46:28.494
and we'll take our own counsel.
