00:04.380 --> 00:05.330
Andi:
Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.330 --> 00:08.290
Andi, I like being around you
more than anyone.

00:08.290 --> 00:12.120
So I was wondering,
maybe you could think
about being around me?

00:12.120 --> 00:14.750
So he asked me
the simplest question:
"What's your next class?"

00:14.750 --> 00:17.290
Which is English--
but guess what I said?

00:17.290 --> 00:19.120
Dimples.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.460
You're not ready
for this kind of relationship
with Jonah.

00:21.460 --> 00:25.250
Jonah Beck likes me.
This is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.330
I want a real race
to prove once and for all
who's the fastest.

00:28.330 --> 00:29.830
You get a real sparkle
in your eye

00:29.830 --> 00:31.250
when you're overconfident.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.540
Is this my dad?

00:32.540 --> 00:33.380
No.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.080
Then who is it?

00:35.080 --> 00:37.210
See? Nobody.

00:37.210 --> 00:39.790
Bex...
will you marry me?

00:39.790 --> 00:42.000
Mom, say yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.500
Um...

00:43.500 --> 00:45.170
So, are they engaged?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.880
Basically.
She just needs a minute
to get her mind around it.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.790
I'm not getting married
to Bowie.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.960
What? No.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.880
You're going to marry Bowie,
you just said you needed
more time.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.420
I did need more time.

00:59.420 --> 01:02.460
Well, it hasn't
even been a day.
Take your time, reflect!

01:02.460 --> 01:06.210
Andi... the answer
was always gonna be no.

01:06.210 --> 01:08.500
It's not that I wasn't ready
to tell Bowie...

01:08.500 --> 01:11.040
I wasn't ready to tell you.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.880
-What?
-I know how much you want
me and Bowie to get married.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.540
Because you guys
love each other.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.460
We do.
But that doesn't mean

01:18.460 --> 01:20.880
we're meant
to life-and-death it.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.830
So...

01:26.330 --> 01:27.790
Bowie knows?

01:27.790 --> 01:31.420
Of course he knows.
I mean... I haven't
told him, but--

01:31.420 --> 01:35.250
So then, how do you explain
the pizza with the rose?

01:35.250 --> 01:39.580
Andi...
you still have
your mother and father.

01:39.580 --> 01:41.500
You have your family.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.420
But I'm not gonna
marry Bowie.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.920
He'll be crushed.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.620
He'll be fine.

01:49.620 --> 01:50.790
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.920
The sooner the better.

01:59.460 --> 02:00.880
(sighs)

02:03.290 --> 02:06.250
But not tomorrow.

02:06.250 --> 02:09.540
Definitely...not tomorrow.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.290

time for hoops.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.080
Basketball, huh?

03:24.080 --> 03:25.500
I love basketball.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.250
Then you should try out
for pep squad.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.710
They cheer at the games.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.540
Or I could sign up
for basketball.

03:30.540 --> 03:34.210
But Jefferson doesn't have
a girls' basketball team.

03:34.210 --> 03:37.120
Then I guess I have no choice.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.040
You are witnessing history:

03:40.040 --> 03:41.500
The first girl
on the Jefferson Middle School

03:41.500 --> 03:42.790
basketball team.

03:44.380 --> 03:46.120
Swish!

03:51.580 --> 03:53.670
Andi:
So, you and Marty, huh?

03:53.670 --> 03:55.880
Me and Marty nothing.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.170
Should we
call you guys "Barty"?

03:58.170 --> 03:59.620
Or do you prefer "Muffy"?

03:59.620 --> 04:01.000
Stop.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.420
(laughs)

04:02.420 --> 04:05.290
Wow. Gorgeous.

04:05.290 --> 04:08.290
Yeah.
Because when you're surrounded
by your relatives paying homage

04:08.290 --> 04:11.380
to your dead ancestors,
you wanna look cute.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.080
For Chinese New Year,
Emily Chang's family

04:13.080 --> 04:15.290
just goes
to the Golden Pagoda restaurant.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.290
I know.
She's lucky.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.670
Every year CeCe tries
so hard to impress
my Aunt Mei

04:20.670 --> 04:23.580
that it turns
into a festival of stress.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.500
A stress-tival.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.710
I remember.

04:26.710 --> 04:29.540
Don't worry.
You never have to come again.

04:29.540 --> 04:33.790
Andi?
Someone here to see you.

04:33.790 --> 04:34.960

Doshe!

05:04.380 --> 05:05.830
What do you do
for Chinese New Year?

05:05.830 --> 05:09.670
Well, there's a big feast,
and we get red envelopes
with money in them.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.120
It's the Year
of the Dog.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.620
Sounds awesome.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.960
You should come.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.620
Really?

05:15.620 --> 05:18.500
Well, y-- y-- you don't
have to.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.750
I'd love to.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.580
Bex?
Did you hear that?

05:23.580 --> 05:25.080
He'd love to!

05:25.080 --> 05:26.620
Yes, I'm following along.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.620
You too, Buffy.
Please come.

05:30.620 --> 05:31.960
Please?

05:31.960 --> 05:33.380
You just said
I didn't have to.

05:35.790 --> 05:40.250
Uh, neither do you.
It's a lot of rituals,
and you gotta dress up,

05:40.250 --> 05:43.170
-and you don't wanna...
-I'll go home and change.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.790
And I gotta
get to the gym.

05:45.790 --> 05:46.620
Bye.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.040
-Watch out for Ronald.
-Who?

05:50.040 --> 05:52.000
You'll see.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.330
What did I just do?

05:55.330 --> 05:57.790
Invited a boy you like
into the belly of the beast.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.790
This is going to be
a disaster.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.750
It'll be fine.
You just have to talk to CeCe
before he gets there.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.790
Because she doesn't
like surprises.
Or boys.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.670
And definitely not
surprise boys.

06:07.670 --> 06:10.830
Okay, say something
that makes me feel better.

06:10.830 --> 06:13.080
There will be turnip cakes.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.500
I do like turnip cakes.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.380
Right.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.540
Is the baby bok choy ready?

06:24.540 --> 06:26.120
Baby bok good to go.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.210
-Woo-woo.
-This is how my mother's kitchen
always used to smell

06:29.210 --> 06:30.710
on Chinese New Year.

06:30.710 --> 06:34.580
Because I'm using
Grandma Chin's recipes.

06:34.580 --> 06:39.250
I never thought I would
say this, but, I'm glad
you're in Bex's life.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.750
-And ours.
-Hm?

06:40.750 --> 06:42.120
Mm...

06:42.120 --> 06:44.120
And I want you to know
that you are always welcome

06:44.120 --> 06:47.500
in our home.
You should consider it
your home.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.790
Because as Andi's father,
you're family.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.960
And should you wanna
add another title to that...

06:51.960 --> 06:54.460
-(Bowie/ Ham chuckling)
-Celia...

06:54.460 --> 06:59.170
In fact...
Bex and I might have
some happy news to share soon.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.540
Are these for the dead
or the living?

07:03.540 --> 07:06.750
Ooh, that looks delicious--
No! Those should go
to the ancestors.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.290
What do you think he meant
by happy news?

07:12.290 --> 07:13.920
Do you think they're
getting engaged?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.540
We'll just have to
wait and see.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.790
But if they are,
wouldn't it be wonderful

07:17.790 --> 07:20.880
to shove it
in my judge-y sister's face!

07:20.880 --> 07:23.830
Well, sure, but we're just
gonna wait and see.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.040
Right?

07:25.040 --> 07:28.710
I don't get to have
any fun at all today?

Well, it's your first year
back in a long time,

07:48.580 --> 07:50.380
so I wanted to make it
special for you.

07:50.380 --> 07:54.000
Mm. Let's just both
pretend that's true.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.790
(whispers)
Hey.

07:55.790 --> 08:00.000
It's so beautiful, CeCe.
It feels wrong that
only our family

08:00.000 --> 08:03.960
gets to experience
this Chen-sation, heh.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.210

08:06.210 --> 08:08.040

08:12.460 --> 08:14.920
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.000

08:18.750 --> 08:20.460
We're still pretending
it lives in the house?

08:20.460 --> 08:22.830
I know, I know,
just once a year.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.580
Happy New Year.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.830
Happy New Year.

08:30.830 --> 08:32.920
Um, thanks for the pizza.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.330
And the rose.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.000
You were saying something
to CeCe?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.880
Yeah, I better
get back to it.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.710

08:47.000 --> 08:49.040
Or, it might be...

08:49.040 --> 08:49.920
I'll get that!

08:53.380 --> 08:55.830
For the last time,
I don't want any magazines.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.580
No, CeCe,
this is my friend Jonah.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.750
Hi, Mrs. Mack.
Nice to meet you.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.540
I know all of Andi's friends.
You're not one of them.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.920
He's a new friend.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.620
Andi:
I invited him.

09:10.790 --> 09:13.880
You're wearing white,
the color of death.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.500
But please, come in.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.750
Fix him before Aunt Mei
gets here.

09:22.710 --> 09:25.420
It wasn't a total disaster.

09:25.420 --> 09:28.040
Year of the Dog!
(quietly) Woof.
Come on.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.080
Thanks, Mr. Mack,
I didn't know.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.830
Lucky we wear
the same size, huh?

09:34.830 --> 09:36.420
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh.

09:36.420 --> 09:37.920
I'll get it.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.670
Gung Hay Fat Choy!

09:41.670 --> 09:43.920
Bex, it's been so long.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.330

09:48.920 --> 09:49.960
Uh-- Mm.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.920
I just wanted
to give you a hand.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.880
Oh... Ronald is in the house.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.500
Hey, Ronald.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.750
Gung Hay Fat Choy.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.880
Mei, this wasn't necessary.

10:01.880 --> 10:07.000
Well, I knew you wouldn't
want a repeat of the Year
of the Rooster tilapia disaster.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.120
(laughs)

10:08.120 --> 10:10.830
Remember that? Oooh.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.000
Oh, how are you
holding up, sweetie?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.920
I'm fine, Auntie Mei.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.290
I think it's
Great Auntie Mei now.

10:17.290 --> 10:20.380
(laughs)
But we'll stick with Auntie Mei
for old time's sake.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.960
Right, Granny?

10:25.040 --> 10:28.290
I'm so sorry my daughter
and son-in-law couldn't be here,

10:28.290 --> 10:31.540
but they're in Tuscany,
in this gorgeous castle.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.880
Aw, too bad
they didn't invite you.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.080
But they did.
I wanted to be here with you.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.540
-(cuckoo clock sounds)
-Oh, good! I'm glad to see

10:40.540 --> 10:42.420
you're keeping
that clock serviced.

10:42.420 --> 10:47.040
(laughing)
It was very expensive,
hand-carved by craftsmen

10:47.040 --> 10:49.330
from the very finest
Black Forest wood, you know.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.330
Mm-hm.
How could I forget?

10:51.330 --> 10:53.170
(laughs)

10:54.250 --> 10:56.420
(quietly)
You won't let me.

10:57.710 --> 10:59.000
(hissing noise)

11:00.000 --> 11:01.960
Sorry, Grandpa.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.120
Go ahead.
Take a shot.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.880
I... don't like those shorts.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.750
I meant a basketball shot.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.210
I don't like
those basketball shorts.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.080
Just throw me the ball.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.040
Can I join?

11:22.170 --> 11:24.250
Okay, Slick, it's on.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.540
It has the same crazy eyes
as our mailman.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
What was that?

11:37.040 --> 11:39.330
I was merely pulling
this silver dollar

11:39.330 --> 11:40.960
out of your ear canal.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.250
That I've magically turned
into this delicious shark gummi!

11:48.250 --> 11:50.080
This is Ronald.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.670
Oh... the famous Ronald.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.210
You're familiar
with my work?

11:54.210 --> 11:57.830
Ronald's a magician...
in training, heh.

11:57.830 --> 11:59.250
What other tricks
can you do?

12:00.580 --> 12:03.380
Make an entire
afternoon disappear.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.040
Ahh, Bowie.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.210
That ginger scallion lobster
smells heavenly.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.620
He's making all of Mom's
traditional dishes.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.040
Shouldn't your caterer
be wearing a hair net?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.210
Bowie's not the caterer.

12:20.210 --> 12:22.000
He's Andi's father.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.580
Andi's father?

12:26.540 --> 12:28.330
I thought he was
out of the picture.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.920
Oh, he's in the picture.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.460
And in the picture,
he's a fabulous cook.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.120
And, an avid botanist.

12:36.170 --> 12:37.960
His work.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.880
What's up?

12:46.880 --> 12:48.290
Ooh...

12:50.120 --> 12:52.920
I am on the verge
of winning Chinese New Year,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.380
but I need a topper.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.380
What's going on
with you and Bowie?

12:56.380 --> 12:58.210
What? Nothing.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.210
That's not gonna
push me over the finish line.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.500
Give me something.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.500
(whispers)
Bowie said there might be
some big news.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.250
Are you two getting engaged?

13:09.250 --> 13:12.120
I'm not...
talking about this with you!

13:16.290 --> 13:18.170
Okay!
Okay!

13:22.250 --> 13:24.170
The food
looks really good.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.380
This isn't even
half of it.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.290
It's gonna be
a full-on feast.

13:27.290 --> 13:29.210
When does it start?
I'm starving.

13:29.210 --> 13:33.620
Pretty soon.
We just have to pray
to the shrine of my ancestors.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.920
Which I have to do now.

13:39.290 --> 13:41.380
(whispers)
How's it work?

13:41.380 --> 13:44.330
You light the incense stick,
and hold it in your hands.

13:44.330 --> 13:47.210
Then you bow
three times standing,

13:47.210 --> 13:49.080
three times kneeling...

13:50.710 --> 13:54.210
and then three times
standing while looking
at the ancestors' photos.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.500
That's beautiful.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.250
(whispering)
Wait, they're all
gonna do it?

14:08.250 --> 14:09.750
(whispering)
Yeah.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.460
(giggles)

14:20.460 --> 14:23.750
Those dumplings
are not for you.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.710
They're an offering
to our ancestors.

14:25.710 --> 14:26.880
Sorry.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.170
It's not his fault.
I didn't tell him.

14:29.170 --> 14:31.290
And he's really hungry.

14:31.290 --> 14:32.330
Who is he again?

14:32.330 --> 14:33.580
I told you,
they're friends.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.460
I just assumed
he was Andi's boyfriend.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.750
He's not Andi's boyfriend,
they play frisbee together.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.080
Um-- (laughs)

14:39.080 --> 14:40.460
Celia:
Andi doesn't have a boyfriend.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.420
Andi is not allowed
to have a boyfriend.

14:42.420 --> 14:44.040
Well, that may be your rule,

14:44.040 --> 14:47.080
but we all know
how good you are
at enforcing it.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.330
I am this close
to saying something
you'll regret.

14:53.330 --> 14:57.620
Whoa, whoa, Mei, Celia,
no one wants another
Year of the Horse.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.330
Why don't we finish honoring
your esteemed ancestors,

15:00.330 --> 15:02.880
and then perhaps a little
good fortune and prosperity?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.120
Please!

15:08.330 --> 15:10.290
Andi: Yeah...

15:10.290 --> 15:12.250
(whispering)
I'm sorry.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.330
Gung Hay Fat Choy.

15:19.330 --> 15:21.380
What's inside?

15:21.380 --> 15:22.830
Ten bucks.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.420
It's what we get every year.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.880
Gung Hay Fat Choy.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.620
- Gung Hay Fat Choy.
-Oh, you don't have
to give me one.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.750
You're still unmarried, so...

15:34.750 --> 15:38.290
Oh, well, when you're
so gracious about it,
thank you.

15:38.290 --> 15:41.380
I'm not judging you, Bex,
I just want you to know.

15:41.380 --> 15:45.290
I mean, just because
my daughter Ling is celebrating
her 15th wedding anniversary

15:45.290 --> 15:49.500
in Tuscany,
it's not a competition.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.120
Celia:
My turn!

15:53.880 --> 15:57.290
- Gung Hay Fat Choy.
-Thank you.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.500
Thanks, CeCe.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.580
Thanks, Mom.

16:01.580 --> 16:05.380
And...
Gung Hay Fat Choy.

16:05.380 --> 16:06.380
Thank you, Mrs. Mack.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.830
Okay, everybody, open 'em.

16:10.290 --> 16:11.580
Well...

16:13.620 --> 16:15.040
Wha--?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.380
I... don't know what to say.

16:18.790 --> 16:22.330
As you know, I'm not big
on public speaking,

16:22.330 --> 16:25.210
but I have something
important to say.

16:26.330 --> 16:27.540
To Bowie.

16:29.210 --> 16:32.080
I've come to see
what a hard-working,

16:32.080 --> 16:34.790
honorable man you are.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.420
-And I wanna make sure
you know...
-Celia.

16:37.420 --> 16:40.420
that if there are any
happy announcements

16:40.420 --> 16:43.380
you'd like to share tonight,

16:43.380 --> 16:45.380
you'd have my blessing.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.960
Guys...

16:57.500 --> 16:59.250
(mouthing)

17:09.380 --> 17:11.620
Excuse me.

17:13.420 --> 17:14.710
Bowie!

17:16.000 --> 17:19.080
What's going on?
Can anyone explain?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.250
I can.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.290
They're not getting married.

17:30.330 --> 17:32.120
I was gonna
talk to you tomorrow.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.120
What were you gonna say?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.330
This isn't about you
and me, Bowie.

17:37.330 --> 17:40.120
-It's not?
-It's about Andi.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.080
More than anything,
she wants us to get married.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.330
You know we'd both
jump off a cliff
to make her happy.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.120
And, we almost did.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.290
What if I wanna jump off
that cliff?

17:52.420 --> 17:54.290
For you.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.420
Bowie, I'll always love you.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.880
We have an amazing bond.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.120
But... that bond is Andi.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.460
We're still a family.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.500
Nothing has to change,
you know that, right?

18:08.500 --> 18:10.750
Yeah.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.380
Right.

18:15.710 --> 18:17.750
No change necessary.

18:29.460 --> 18:32.420
Uh, don't worry.
Everything's fine.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.880
Just gonna take off.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.920
Happy New Year, everyone.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.330
Bowie!

18:57.830 --> 18:59.540
Are you okay?

18:59.540 --> 19:02.500
Of course I'm not okay.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.420
I will be.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.420
Go back, enjoy your family.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.170
And, uh, just tell me...

19:20.170 --> 19:23.880
Jonah?
Is he the guy you like?

19:25.920 --> 19:27.500
(chuckles)

19:31.710 --> 19:33.210
Bye.

19:40.830 --> 19:42.330
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:42.330 --> 19:43.790
Stop, drop and roll.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.290
'Cause I'm on fire.

19:45.290 --> 19:47.670
You're not even on the squad
and you're already the MVP?

19:47.670 --> 19:48.920
That's right.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.710
Are you familiar
with the concept,
"team player"?

19:51.710 --> 19:55.620
I'm familiar with the ball
and the net, and that's
what matters.

19:55.620 --> 19:59.670
You're too much.
I really hope you
and your ego make the team.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.290
Later, brah.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.580
Oh, good.
Are we done basketballing?

20:10.580 --> 20:11.880
Please say yes.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.750
You can go.
I wanna work
on my free throws.

20:13.750 --> 20:17.380
Hey, wait, wait--
You seem nervous.
Are you nervous?

20:17.380 --> 20:20.040
I'm not gonna make the team
if I'm as good as the boys.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.380
I have to be better.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.380
So, yeah, I'm nervous.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.420
But, you can't repeat that.

20:26.420 --> 20:28.000
Repeat what?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.540
You see what I did there?

20:30.540 --> 20:32.080
Can I tell you a secret?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.830
What?

20:33.830 --> 20:35.620
(quietly)
You're gonna make the team.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.500
Thanks, Cyrus.

20:40.710 --> 20:43.540
Later, girl-brah.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.500
That didn't sound right.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.750
Thanks again
for inviting me.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.080
I'm sorry about
the dumpling.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.960
And Ronald.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.790
And the shirt.
And the fish eyes.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.290
I'm glad I came.

21:02.290 --> 21:04.960
It was an experience
I could only have with you.

21:06.460 --> 21:07.540
I had a really
nice time.

21:07.540 --> 21:09.290
Oh, it was good
to have you.

21:09.290 --> 21:11.290
Xie xie.

21:11.290 --> 21:13.420
Where'd you learn
to say thank you?

21:14.670 --> 21:15.790
(Ham/Andi chuckling)

21:15.790 --> 21:17.790
Well, it was in Mandarin,
not Cantonese...

21:17.790 --> 21:21.120
but, you're welcome.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.500
(quietly)
Thank you.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.710
So, was that too weird?

21:25.710 --> 21:27.420
Oh...
this is nothing.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.500
-You should see
Easter at my house.
-(both laugh)

21:29.500 --> 21:34.790
Sweetie, I thought maybe
we should have Chinese New Year
at my house next year.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.750
-Why?
-I think managing
all the traditions

21:37.750 --> 21:39.420
might be too much for you.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.620
You have to agree this was not
the most auspicious start

21:42.620 --> 21:44.710
to a new year.
(chuckles)

21:44.710 --> 21:46.460
You are right, Mei.

21:46.460 --> 21:50.830
I mean-- And one tradition
that definitely ends today, is--

21:54.750 --> 21:58.080
hanging this ridiculous thing up
once a year when you come!

21:58.080 --> 22:01.170
(gasps)
Ronald! We're going!

22:04.790 --> 22:08.500
And get that ridiculous
infinity handkerchief
outta your mouth!

22:11.330 --> 22:13.670
-Same time next year!
-Year of the Pig!

22:13.670 --> 22:15.000
(both oinking)
-Ooh.
-Oh.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.750
(both laughing)

22:21.040 --> 22:23.620
How are you possibly
still hungry?

22:23.620 --> 22:27.170
I didn't eat much.
There was a lot going on.

22:27.170 --> 22:29.710
I feel so bad about Bowie.

22:29.710 --> 22:31.330
You should.

22:31.330 --> 22:33.420
Just admit it,
you were wrong about him.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.080
Hey.
I'm perfectly capable
of beating myself up

22:36.080 --> 22:37.880
without your help, thank you.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.540
Ooh, secret stash.

22:44.540 --> 22:45.790
Wait, Andi, don't!

22:47.580 --> 22:50.210
Wait-- What is this?

22:54.540 --> 22:57.290
This is that picture
that you ripped up
and threw away

22:57.290 --> 23:00.250
because you said
he was nobody!

23:00.250 --> 23:02.880
So you took it out of the trash,
taped it back together,

23:02.880 --> 23:05.620
and hid it again
inside a Toaster Tart box?

23:06.790 --> 23:09.790
-He's just--
-Don't say he's nobody!

23:12.000 --> 23:14.670
Is he the real reason
why you can't marry Bowie?

23:21.420 --> 23:22.460
Andi:
Next, on Andi Mack...

23:22.460 --> 23:23.500
I have feelings.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.120
I'm sure you do.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.120
I've just never seen them.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.920
You just have to get
to know me better.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.000
I have to?

23:31.750 --> 23:34.500
You really think you're gonna
make the boys' basketball team?

23:34.500 --> 23:35.750
Buffy:
That was a foul!

23:35.750 --> 23:37.830
This is a drill.
There aren't any fouls
in a drill.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.170
Can I watch it from here?

23:39.170 --> 23:41.790
I feel safer,
like you're protecting me.

23:41.790 --> 23:44.170
Andi:
Jonah says she wants
to be friends.

23:44.170 --> 23:47.750
Jonah just wants everything
to be "docious magocious."
