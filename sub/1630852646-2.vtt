UNGTEORI TONGDAK

00:25.480 --> 00:27.040
We put our soul into this chicken.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.240
Gosh, thank you.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.800
<i>Seoul is my whole life</i>

00:40.880 --> 00:46.760
<i>and, at night, I feel alive!</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:50.800
I think I’m a night owl.

00:53.080 --> 00:57.560
I tell the chicken "I love you"

00:58.040 --> 01:00.200
before serving it.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.720
I’ve heard that the food
can understand it.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.319
It makes me feel warm inside.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.760
It does?

01:11.840 --> 01:13.320
Yes!

01:13.400 --> 01:14.560
UNGTEORI TONGDAK

01:14.640 --> 01:17.040
Welcome! Grab a seat inside.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.560
<i>Tradition is not buried in time.</i>

01:27.640 --> 01:31.400
It is something that
always moves dynamically.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.840
<i>Seoul is a very complicated</i>

01:42.920 --> 01:47.920
<i>and restless city that never stops
even late at night.</i>

01:50.680 --> 01:53.840
<i>All kinds of things are in motion,</i>

01:53.920 --> 01:57.240
they come together
and develop into something new.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.840
<i>The current trend in Seoul, "Newtro"</i>

02:31.920 --> 02:33.800
<i>is a combination</i>

02:35.280 --> 02:38.520
<i>of the words "New" and "Retro."</i>

02:38.600 --> 02:42.920
The younger generation views this as a way
of rediscovering the values of the past

02:43.000 --> 02:44.880
and reinterpreting them in a modern way.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.440
-Nice work!
-Nice work!

02:47.520 --> 02:50.280
<i>Seoul’s nighttime is
when we stop running forward</i>

02:50.360 --> 02:52.960
<i>and focus on finding our identity.</i>

02:54.480 --> 02:58.480
<i>Seoul’s nighttime always excites me!</i>

02:59.240 --> 03:03.160
The night is the time that
gets my heart beating.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.200
<i>Seoul is a dynamic city with
endless buildings</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:18.960
<i>and a huge population</i>

03:19.040 --> 03:21.000
<i>where everything changes rapidly.</i>

03:26.680 --> 03:31.040
Seoul at night is
the best time to truly experience

03:31.120 --> 03:33.680
<i>Seoul’s complex and ever changing trends.</i>

03:35.240 --> 03:37.320
<i>No matter which street you’re on,</i>

03:37.400 --> 03:39.560
<i>late into the night
you can see people chatting,</i>

03:39.640 --> 03:40.760
<i>having a drink,</i>

03:40.840 --> 03:43.960
<i>and finding ways to</i>

03:44.040 --> 03:45.680
<i>express themselves.</i>

03:58.520 --> 03:59.760
<i>Seoul at nighttime,</i>

04:01.120 --> 04:03.280
<i>it’s very diverse.</i>

04:06.720 --> 04:09.000
<i>Seongsu-dong is a
really interesting neighborhood.</i>

04:09.520 --> 04:10.960
<i>Some people call it</i>

04:11.040 --> 04:13.040
<i>the Brooklyn of Seoul.</i>

04:15.360 --> 04:17.800
<i>It has been an industrial area
for a long time.</i>

04:17.880 --> 04:20.200
<i>The factories are still here.</i>

04:20.280 --> 04:23.839
And right next to them
there are these really cool shops,

04:23.920 --> 04:25.440
<i>cafes, restaurants</i>

04:25.519 --> 04:28.040
<i>and pubs.</i>

04:28.120 --> 04:31.200
<i>So, Seongsu-dong is an area where</i>

04:31.280 --> 04:34.000
<i>the old and new coexist,</i>

04:34.080 --> 04:37.080
<i>the perfect place to start</i>

04:37.160 --> 04:39.680
<i>a brewery that makes</i> makgeolli,

04:39.760 --> 04:43.440
a traditional Korean liquor

04:43.520 --> 04:45.320
in a different new style.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.600
Makgeolli<i> is an alcohol made with rice</i>

04:51.680 --> 04:54.920
<i>that’s been produced in Korea
for more than a thousand years.</i>

04:56.360 --> 05:01.120
<i>Throughout the '70s and '80s,
South Korea’s economy developed rapidly.</i>

05:02.000 --> 05:05.520
<i>People became
more interested in new spirits</i>

05:05.600 --> 05:09.160
<i>that came from the West,
like beer and whiskey.</i>

05:10.360 --> 05:13.800
So interest in <i>makgeolli</i>
naturally died out.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.400
<i>But these days, </i>makgeolli

05:15.480 --> 05:18.160
<i>seems to be reaching out to people again.</i>

05:18.240 --> 05:20.240
<i>I think one of the many reasons is that</i>

05:20.880 --> 05:27.320
<i>the number of small breweries,
like ours, is increasing.</i>

05:34.560 --> 05:36.960
You have to wash the rice very well.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.920
Or else the alcohol won’t taste so good.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.480
What was the question again?

05:54.200 --> 05:57.520
My name is Koh Sung-Yong
and I’m the founder of Hangang Brewery.

06:00.520 --> 06:05.520
<i>I think I have
a typical Korean personality.</i>

06:06.880 --> 06:09.400
<i>I’m not talkative,</i>

06:09.480 --> 06:12.440
<i>I’m quiet, and I’m an introvert.</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:16.320
But when it comes to business,
I aim for success.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.960
I always try to come up
with something new.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.080
<i>My first dream was always</i>

06:22.160 --> 06:24.440
<i>to start my own brand.</i>

06:25.160 --> 06:28.160
I was thinking of something Korean.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.920
<i>People thought of </i>makgeolli
<i>as an old man’s drink</i>

06:34.000 --> 06:36.080
<i>or as a cheap drink.</i>

06:36.680 --> 06:40.440
So I thought it would be a good idea
to change those negative perceptions

06:40.520 --> 06:43.600
and that is how we started.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.760
<i>The concept is not to follow
the tradition completely as it was</i>

06:50.840 --> 06:55.680
<i>but to tweak it so that
it works in the modern world.</i>

07:00.680 --> 07:04.080
<i>So while we followed
some of the traditions in making </i>makgeolli

07:04.160 --> 07:08.160
<i>we reinterpreted and modernized it,
so that people now and also</i>

07:08.240 --> 07:11.520
<i>in the future could enjoy it.</i>

07:29.920 --> 07:35.280
<i>We’re a small brewery
that hasn’t been around for long.</i>

07:36.520 --> 07:42.480
<i>But our ultimate goal is to
create a </i>makgeolli<i> that could become</i>

07:42.560 --> 07:45.320
<i>the new standard of all </i>makgeolli.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.560
<i>Tonight, for Naroo Makgeolli’s
tasting session,</i>

07:57.640 --> 08:01.160
<i>we’ve come to one of the hottest
traditional bars, Baekgom Makgeolli.</i>

08:05.400 --> 08:07.680
<i>For traditional drinks,
including </i>makgeolli,

08:07.760 --> 08:10.760
most of the breweries are small.

08:10.840 --> 08:16.920
They don’t have the methods to
self-promote their drinks.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.320
<i>Baekgom Makgeolli is a hub that connects
the breweries across the country</i>

08:21.400 --> 08:26.160
<i>and brings together people
who are interested in traditional liquor.</i>

08:27.440 --> 08:31.560
The drink in the big glass is
the 6 percent Naroo Makgeolli, have a try.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.920
And then there’s the 11.5 percent,
the stronger version.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.760
I think they like this one more.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.120
Seasoned drinkers prefer the stronger one.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.600
I drink a lot of <i>makgeolli</i> with my father.

08:48.679 --> 08:51.120
This is different from
the <i>makgeolli</i> I usually drink,

08:51.200 --> 08:54.000
it's more dense and powerful.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.120
I was planning on just having a sip
but I couldn’t stop myself.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.280
-It’s hard to stop once you've started.
-Yes.

09:00.360 --> 09:05.040
<i>Young people these days are</i>

09:05.120 --> 09:09.960
very interested in tradition
and that’s become a culture of its own.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.360
<i>Being able to be part of that</i>

09:14.440 --> 09:16.120
<i>changing drinking culture,</i>

09:16.200 --> 09:21.480
I feel like we are contributing to Seoul,
the evolving Seoul.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.840
<i>You can't fully enjoy a night out in Seoul
without food or drinks.</i>

09:49.160 --> 09:54.440
<i>Koreans love to eat food with their drinks</i>

09:54.520 --> 09:56.440
and hence the concept of "<i>anju,</i>"

09:56.520 --> 09:58.960
which are the foods
that are consumed with drinks.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.800
<i>Typical examples of </i>anju <i>are chicken feet
and sea snails to go with soju,</i>

10:02.880 --> 10:06.280
pajeon<i> or tofu kimchi
to go with </i>makgeolli,

10:06.360 --> 10:08.560
<i>but probably the most well-known is</i>

10:08.640 --> 10:10.160
<i>chicken with beer.</i>

10:11.160 --> 10:14.440
"Chimaek" <i>is a combination of the words
chicken and </i>maekju<i>, meaning beer.</i>

10:26.000 --> 10:28.280
UNGTEORI TONGDAK

10:28.360 --> 10:34.680
<i>Ungteori Tongdak is a famous restaurant
where people line up late into the night.</i>

10:34.760 --> 10:38.560
-Hello.
-Welcome! Grab a seat inside.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.200
<i>These days, there are
many franchise chicken restaurants</i>

10:43.280 --> 10:49.160
<i>but not many of them maintain
that local chicken restaurant atmosphere.</i>

10:49.240 --> 10:50.480
Here you go.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.280
-Just one?
-One chicken?

10:53.360 --> 10:54.480
Yes, of course.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.520
<i>We started Ungteori Tongdak
around May 1997</i>

10:58.600 --> 11:02.320
and we’ve been
running it for about 24 years

11:02.400 --> 11:03.760
as husband and wife.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.280
Did you put your soul into it, your soul?

11:06.360 --> 11:08.040
Of course, I put in all my soul.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.680
<i>My husband said, "Let’s go with
the name 'Ungteori Tongdak'."</i>

11:13.200 --> 11:16.480
I said, "What! Why 'Absurd Chicken'?"
But I really liked it.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.320
It has a friendly connotation.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.000
Everything is absurd
so it is called "Ungteori."

11:24.080 --> 11:27.040
If there are three of you,
you must order a minimum of

11:27.120 --> 11:29.320
-two alcoholic drinks and one soda.
-Okay.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.120
I feel comfortable with
the late night customers.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.840
<i>Once they come into our restaurant
it’s like they become a family instantly.</i>

11:39.920 --> 11:42.760
The owners here are like…

11:42.840 --> 11:47.000
Well, it’s actually my first time here
but they are so friendly.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.760
Pretty lady, where do you live?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.760
-I knew it.
-Which one is the pretty lady?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.080
I'll do it, ma'am.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.240
-Both!
-Which one is the pretty lady?

11:53.320 --> 11:54.600
-No, she means me.
-Both!

11:54.680 --> 11:57.080
-Uncle is very good looking too.
-Yes, thank you.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.520
<i>Before Ungteori Tongdak,</i>

12:00.600 --> 12:03.880
<i>my husband ran big </i>galbi<i> restaurants,
but they went bankrupt twice.</i>

12:07.040 --> 12:09.840
<i>He’s shy, so he stays in the kitchen.</i>

12:09.920 --> 12:13.560
I put my husband in the back
and I stepped forward.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.800
What would you say our secret is?
Me being the boss?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.560
I became the one in charge.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.720
This is the president
and I’m just a worker.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.560
I just like being with people
and talking with them because

12:27.640 --> 12:29.600
I talk a lot!

12:30.800 --> 12:32.320
-We ordered two--
-Two?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.480
-We ordered two.
-We're getting one more, right?

12:34.560 --> 12:37.720
Once you guys almost finish this one,
the second one will come out.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.600
<i>And because I love talking,</i>

12:41.680 --> 12:43.720
<i>more customers started turning up.</i>

12:43.800 --> 12:47.360
I thought "I have a talent
for running a business."

12:55.480 --> 12:58.680
<i>I grew up in Anseong, in Gyeonggi Province</i>

12:58.760 --> 13:03.000
and 40 years ago,
when I got married, we moved to Seoul.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.720
<i>We had an arranged marriage.</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:12.440
<i>Mom seemed to really like him
as a son-in-law material.</i>

13:13.120 --> 13:17.720
<i>My husband is a hard working man, but…
he’s a bit of a dumbhead.</i>

13:18.320 --> 13:19.600
Dumbhead.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.520
You are.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
Try speaking for yourself…

13:27.400 --> 13:30.520
<i>We’re like the two wheels of a bicycle.</i>

13:30.600 --> 13:32.680
Why do you keep on
saying only pretty stuff?

13:32.760 --> 13:33.840
It’s so funny.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.240
But there is no better answer.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.520
We are not the best match.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.640
<i>When I first came to Seoul</i>

13:46.640 --> 13:48.720
<i>I think I felt unsettled.</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:56.800
<i>40 years ago our country
wasn’t that well-off.</i>

13:57.640 --> 14:02.080
Everyone was "<i>ppalli-ppalli</i>"
and acting busy.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.960
Uncles, was that two beers and one cola?

14:05.040 --> 14:06.160
-Yes.
-Yes.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.360
Now, here I am running a chicken shop

14:11.440 --> 14:14.480
and meeting
and talking with lots of people.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.400
<i>This has been my happiness.</i>

14:17.480 --> 14:18.320
Thank you.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.640
<i>The recipe, it took me about 4 years.</i>

14:29.640 --> 14:34.560
<i>The difference between our chicken
and foreign fried chicken</i>

14:34.640 --> 14:36.680
<i>is that we fry in a </i>gamasot,

14:36.760 --> 14:41.760
<i>and the reason we fry twice is to keep
a constant temperature.</i>

14:41.840 --> 14:45.120
It gives a crispier,
cleaner taste to the chicken.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.080
Madam, I heard this is
the best chicken place in Itaewon.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.840
<i>Itaewon is an attractive neighborhood
big on nighttime fun.</i>

14:54.920 --> 14:57.000
<i>There’s always a lot of fun parties.</i>

14:57.080 --> 14:58.760
<i>It’s a global neighborhood.</i>

15:00.480 --> 15:03.200
<i>Itaewon has changed
a lot through the 25 years</i>

15:03.280 --> 15:05.320
<i>I’ve been working here.</i>

15:05.400 --> 15:06.800
ONE DRINK PER PERSON

15:06.880 --> 15:08.800
Running this business
for such a long time,

15:08.880 --> 15:11.480
it feels like Ungteori Tongdak
has become a part of

15:11.560 --> 15:13.200
<i>the history of Seoul and Itaewon.</i>

15:14.280 --> 15:17.760
Young people keep telling me,
"Madam, you should go on a holiday."

15:17.840 --> 15:20.720
And I say to them,
"This is a paradise here,

15:20.800 --> 15:22.440
where shall I go?"

15:22.520 --> 15:26.000
This place keeps me going

15:26.080 --> 15:28.600
so I always try my very best.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.880
You only say pretty words.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.680
It’s the correct answer!

16:37.360 --> 16:40.160
<i>Their music incorporates
what we call "Pansori."</i>

16:40.240 --> 16:43.080
<i>It's this genre
of traditional Korean music</i>

16:43.160 --> 16:44.760
<i>that's a form of storytelling</i>

16:46.600 --> 16:49.040
<i>You turtle bitch!</i>

16:49.120 --> 16:53.400
<i>Although the king is very important
How can you tell a lie?</i>

16:53.480 --> 16:56.040
<i>Didn’t you ever hear the proverb?</i>

16:56.120 --> 17:00.560
<i>In history, the person
Who manipulates is always killed</i>

17:00.640 --> 17:05.160
It’s common to start a band with
the friends around you.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.760
<i>Since many of my friends
were playing traditional music,</i>

17:09.839 --> 17:12.720
<i>Leenalchi was just
naturally the next step.</i>

17:12.800 --> 17:15.040
<i>-Okay! Open up my stomach!
-Okay! Open up my stomach!</i>

17:15.119 --> 17:17.839
<i>-Open up my stomach!
-Open up my stomach!</i>

17:17.920 --> 17:20.160
<i>-Okay! Open up my stomach!
-Okay! Open up my stomach!</i>

17:20.240 --> 17:22.440
<i>-There’s nothing but waste
-There’s nothing but waste</i>

17:22.520 --> 17:24.240
<i>-So open up my stomach
-So open up my stomach</i>

17:24.319 --> 17:28.240
<i>-And that’s all you’ll see
-And that’s all you’ll see</i>

17:28.800 --> 17:31.800
Just one person does it. Not all together.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.440
It was funny yesterday.
They were dancing so hard.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.320
<i>It wasn't a musical experiment.</i>

17:38.400 --> 17:42.880
It was more of
an experiment of possibilities.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.640
Something like a bird sound.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.600
No, no.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.360
No, not like that!

17:50.840 --> 17:52.360
You know, something like "tweet."

17:55.200 --> 17:59.480
<i>When Director Jang Young-gyu
suggested that we should do</i>

17:59.560 --> 18:02.960
<i>some musical experiments
with the Pansori story Sugungga,</i>

18:03.040 --> 18:06.000
I was excited because I thought,

18:06.080 --> 18:09.440
"Wow, I can probably expect something that

18:09.520 --> 18:11.800
I have never seen before."

18:12.760 --> 18:14.720
<i>Seen from above
The ocean surface is waving</i>

18:14.800 --> 18:16.560
No, no.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.520
Let’s just skip that one for now.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.480
-Okay.
-Yes.

18:21.040 --> 18:25.320
Actually we were worried about whether
we would work out as a band

18:26.160 --> 18:29.920
<i>because our group, unlike most bands,</i>

18:30.000 --> 18:33.800
<i>has two bass players, one drummer,
and four vocalists.</i>

18:33.880 --> 18:37.560
Yes. Shall we try doing that lightly
and become stronger in this part?

18:37.640 --> 18:40.720
<i>Of the four vocalists,</i>

18:40.800 --> 18:43.360
Na-rae has the most sensitive side.

18:49.240 --> 18:55.000
<i>I grew up in a very small town
in the countryside.</i>

18:55.080 --> 18:59.040
Even before I could speak, my grandfather

18:59.120 --> 19:02.280
would sit me on his lap and sing me

19:02.360 --> 19:05.800
<i>traditional Korean
traditional songs called Sijo.</i>

19:07.720 --> 19:14.680
<i>-If you want me to say, I will
-If you want me to say, I will</i>

19:14.760 --> 19:21.480
<i>-If you want me to say, I will
-If you want me to say, I will</i>

19:23.920 --> 19:26.520
<i>When I was young, my grandfather</i>

19:26.600 --> 19:29.840
<i>was hospitalized for about
three to four years.</i>

19:29.920 --> 19:34.960
Whenever I sang for him,
it would make him really happy.

19:36.920 --> 19:42.240
<i>When the moon is full, remove the liver</i>

19:43.040 --> 19:46.880
<i>But after he passed away, since then…</i>

19:48.560 --> 19:52.160
<i>I became a little hesitant to
sing in front of a crowd.</i>

19:55.600 --> 19:56.920
That’s how I felt.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.480
<i>The night has become a moment</i>

20:14.560 --> 20:18.840
that makes me reflect upon myself
and allows me to grow.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.280
<i>Tonight, I will be performing in Hongdae.</i>

20:29.200 --> 20:33.040
<i>Hongdae is a really important place
for bands and indie musicians.</i>

20:33.120 --> 20:36.880
<i>It’s like their playground</i>

20:37.600 --> 20:42.720
<i>and it’s a place where people can</i>

20:42.800 --> 20:45.000
experiment safely and grow.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.200
<i>When you come to Gangnam,</i>

21:15.280 --> 21:22.000
<i>you see expensive cars,
tall grey buildings</i>

21:22.080 --> 21:25.440
<i>and people with straight faces</i>

21:25.520 --> 21:31.240
<i>repeating the same routines every day.</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:36.440
<i>But at night, Gangnam is very fancy,</i>

21:36.520 --> 21:41.880
<i>with neon signs and a colorful nightlife.</i>

21:42.360 --> 21:44.960
Everyone in the world knows

21:45.040 --> 21:47.800
"Gangnam Style"

21:47.880 --> 21:51.920
<i>and they have this preconceived
fantasy of the streets.</i>

21:53.000 --> 21:56.520
<i>When I told people that I was going to
open a bar in Gangnam,</i>

21:56.600 --> 22:02.760
they thought it would be really awesome,
really big and gorgeous.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.520
<i>But when I told them </i>

22:05.600 --> 22:10.560
<i>that I was going to open this bar
within a traditional market,</i>

22:10.640 --> 22:14.520
they all said, "You're going to fail."

22:32.120 --> 22:33.880
<i>Although Gangnam is modern,</i>

22:33.960 --> 22:39.280
<i>you can still find pockets of
old Korea even now.</i>

22:39.880 --> 22:42.480
I'll give you some as a sample.
Try eating them like this.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.720
Thank you.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.640
Seoul has many traditional markets,

22:47.720 --> 22:50.280
<i>but Yeongdong Traditional Market</i>

22:50.360 --> 22:54.360
<i>is the only one in Gangnam that maintains
its '70s street market identity.</i>

22:55.760 --> 22:58.640
<i>At its heart is Jangseng Geongangwon,</i>

22:58.720 --> 23:02.320
<i>a cool bar that makes cocktails
with Korean ingredients.</i>

23:02.400 --> 23:03.880
COCKTAILS

23:03.960 --> 23:07.800
When I first visited Yeongdong Market,

23:07.880 --> 23:10.400
it felt like a place
that was lost in time.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.800
<i>Gangnam is the fastest-changing place</i>

23:13.880 --> 23:17.360
<i>of all fast-changing places.</i>

23:17.440 --> 23:19.840
<i>The market is inside
the fastest-changing place,</i>

23:19.920 --> 23:21.680
<i>but it doesn’t change.</i>

23:22.440 --> 23:25.080
<i>I thought maybe I could do something
to help this place</i>

23:25.160 --> 23:31.200
<i>connect with the modern world,
to grease the rusty wheels.</i>

23:34.440 --> 23:36.920
<i>Before I opened Jangseng Geongangwon,</i>

23:37.000 --> 23:40.160
<i>I worked at the Park Hyatt
as head bartender</i>

23:40.240 --> 23:43.000
<i>and then at JW Marriott Hotel
as bar manager.</i>

23:43.080 --> 23:45.000
I was a rising star!

23:47.520 --> 23:51.600
<i>When I participated in global competitions
or travelled around the world,</i>

23:51.680 --> 23:53.880
people always asked me,
"Oh, you’re a bartender?

23:53.960 --> 23:57.400
But how come you don’t make
cocktails from your country’s liquor?"

23:57.960 --> 24:03.080
I was very embarrassed,
but also felt a kind of patriotism.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.200
Welcome.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.480
Take a seat.
Please get their coats for them.

24:08.600 --> 24:13.680
This Hyoje cocktail I’m preparing
expresses the essence of wildflowers.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.360
Wildflower has the ability to heal

24:16.440 --> 24:21.880
the exhausted souls of our modern society.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.640
<i>It’s a traditional liquor base.</i>

24:31.120 --> 24:33.680
<i>We make all of our cocktails</i>

24:34.280 --> 24:39.960
with rare ingredients like
ginseng, <i>doraji</i>, and sesame leaf.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.000
It’s very fresh.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.040
Creamy but fresh.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.880
STICKY RICE DONUTS
HOT FISH CAKES

25:04.080 --> 25:05.680
Good evening, ma'am!

25:05.760 --> 25:08.160
What’s good here lately?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.680
-Red beans.
-Red beans?

25:09.760 --> 25:10.880
I see.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.000
It wasn’t easy to persuade
the vendors at first.

25:16.080 --> 25:20.120
The vendors thought it was
a dodgy bar with an escort service.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.120
Are solid ginseng good ones?
Or are the thick ones…

25:23.800 --> 25:27.240
-Depends on the age.
-The age… so older is better.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.840
<i>Most Koreans are a little shy.</i>

25:30.920 --> 25:33.440
<i>So I took the first step</i>

25:33.520 --> 25:35.720
<i>and they opened up a lot.</i>

25:36.440 --> 25:38.840
What about these red dates, are they good?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.160
Yes, this season's freshest!

25:43.720 --> 25:45.000
-They’re tasty!
-Good, right?

25:45.080 --> 25:46.240
Really tasty.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.440
We became close, like a family.

25:49.520 --> 25:53.800
He has good manners, he’s conscientious
and hard working. Isn’t he?

25:53.880 --> 25:55.760
Thank you!

26:01.640 --> 26:04.480
<i>We make a special "Cocktail of the Month"
with a different vendor monthly.</i>

26:04.560 --> 26:06.480
-Good evening, sir!
-Hey.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.680
Can we get <i>tteokbokki</i> soup?
We don’t need the rice cakes

26:09.760 --> 26:11.600
but mainly soup instead.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.240
We made this using the red pepper sauce

26:24.320 --> 26:27.680
from the <i>tteokbokki</i> shop.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.760
I’ll make one cool
and one warm like a soup,

26:32.840 --> 26:35.920
a slightly flip-style cocktail.

26:38.200 --> 26:45.160
<i>Jangseng Geongangwon is a great example
of how young people in Seoul</i>

26:45.240 --> 26:49.040
are seeking to reinterpret the past
in a playful, modern way.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.800
Young people are on the hunt
for the "newtro" feeling.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.920
<i>As we became famous,</i>

26:58.000 --> 26:59.520
<i>more young people turned up</i>

26:59.600 --> 27:01.600
<i>and the vendors liked that a lot.</i>

27:01.680 --> 27:03.680
They say they feel
as if the street is getting younger.

27:03.760 --> 27:07.800
Hello! I brought you
our collaboration special with <i>tteokbokki</i>.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.400
<i>This whole street is changing,</i>

27:11.480 --> 27:13.560
which is something I always imagined…

27:15.600 --> 27:19.560
but now it’s becoming a reality.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.240
Smile, one, two, three…

29:03.720 --> 29:04.760
We’re coming through!

29:08.080 --> 29:08.920
Pedestrian!

29:15.560 --> 29:17.280
Nice work!

29:19.000 --> 29:20.040
Nice work!

29:20.720 --> 29:21.800
Nice work!

29:24.240 --> 29:25.320
Let’s take a photo.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.800
One, two, three…

29:49.720 --> 29:50.960
Three, four…

29:51.040 --> 29:53.520
Hands on waist, roll your neck.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.840
Two, three, four…

30:06.800 --> 30:09.240
<i>Everyone runs for their own reasons,</i>

30:09.320 --> 30:12.880
<i>but running together creates synergy.</i>

30:12.960 --> 30:15.240
Like the saying states,
"If you go alone, you can go quickly

30:15.320 --> 30:17.160
but if you want to go far
you should go together."

30:18.760 --> 30:20.840
We are coming through. Be careful!

30:26.560 --> 30:28.040
Nice work.

30:56.400 --> 31:01.160
<i>A lot of musicians gather around Hongdae,</i>

31:01.240 --> 31:06.880
and in the time that
I’ve lived here I’ve witnessed

31:07.400 --> 31:09.200
the cycle of them coming and going.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.360
GOPCHANG JEONGOL

31:13.000 --> 31:15.360
<i>Gopchang Jeongol in Hongdae,</i>

31:15.920 --> 31:21.600
<i>it’s been providing a safe haven
for musicians for a long time.</i>

31:27.040 --> 31:30.720
<i>I think Leenalchi’s second ever
performance was held here.</i>

31:30.800 --> 31:34.040
<i>Everyone is looking forward to it today</i>

31:34.120 --> 31:35.640
and feeling a little excited.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.840
-It’s a tight squeeze tonight.
-Oh really?

31:49.320 --> 31:52.400
<i>Our schedule has definitely become
much busier,</i>

31:52.480 --> 31:55.800
<i>and we appear on TV shows</i>

31:55.880 --> 31:59.560
<i>or ads that we never imagined
we would be on</i>

31:59.640 --> 32:04.680
but it’s not like everything stops
when we walk down the street.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.440
So I would say
we are just starting to feel it.

32:10.200 --> 32:16.600
<i>This is the first time in a while
having the audience up close,</i>

32:16.680 --> 32:22.760
so I’m excited to see
how much they’ll enjoy it.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.840
Let me tell you
a little bit about the past.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.600
We came here back when we weren’t famous.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.960
We sang here once but back then,

32:47.040 --> 32:49.640
our outfits didn’t match!

32:50.480 --> 32:52.080
But today we are famous!

32:53.120 --> 32:55.160
We are wearing cool outfits!

32:55.640 --> 32:58.800
We are back in glory!

33:06.760 --> 33:11.920
People tell me,
"Oh my god! This is really fun!"

33:12.000 --> 33:15.400
<i>A tiger is coming down
A tiger is coming down</i>

33:15.480 --> 33:19.080
<i>A beast is coming down through
The deep valley in the forest</i>

33:19.160 --> 33:22.720
<i>Making the high hills shiver
Both ears pricked up</i>

33:22.800 --> 33:26.320
<i>His body is striped
Full of tail</i>

33:26.400 --> 33:28.760
<i>Longer than a grown man’s arm span</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:31.200
<i>When I perform,
I feel what they are thinking,</i>

33:31.280 --> 33:36.320
<i>what kind of energy they are giving me,
and how they are enjoying the performance.</i>

33:36.800 --> 33:38.760
<i>The startled turtle retracts his head</i>

33:38.840 --> 33:42.560
<i>And freezes on the spot</i>

33:42.640 --> 33:46.160
<i>A tiger is coming down
A tiger is coming down</i>

33:46.240 --> 33:49.920
<i>A tiger is coming down
A tiger is coming down</i>

33:50.000 --> 33:53.600
<i>A tiger is coming down
A tiger is coming down</i>

33:53.680 --> 34:00.080
<i>A tiger is coming down
A tiger is coming down</i>

34:02.320 --> 34:04.520
-Encore!
-Encore!

34:04.600 --> 34:11.440
<i>People used to show a resistance
towards Korean traditional music</i>

34:11.520 --> 34:15.440
but the younger generation

34:15.520 --> 34:19.320
is a generation
with no prejudice whatsoever.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.360
It’s difficult to gain much success
as an indie band,

34:22.440 --> 34:24.600
yet they did it,
and it’s especially surprising

34:24.679 --> 34:27.600
because they’re doing something very

34:27.679 --> 34:29.719
Korean, and became a huge sensation.

34:30.440 --> 34:36.400
<i>Does it worry you having
Your gray-haired mother at home?</i>

34:36.480 --> 34:42.280
<i>Does being a loyal courtier
To the king with</i>

34:42.360 --> 34:47.199
<i>Your government post worry you?</i>

34:47.280 --> 34:49.840
<i>Before, as a traditional Pansori singer,</i>

34:49.920 --> 34:53.920
<i>I don’t think I could
fully express myself as Lee Na-rae.</i>

34:57.080 --> 35:02.160
<i>It is only since I joined Leenalchi
that I truly feel</i>

35:02.240 --> 35:05.600
that I was born to sing like this.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.480
<i>I don’t like how he visits
When I’m not around</i>

35:10.280 --> 35:12.040
<i>And now when I perform with them</i>

35:12.120 --> 35:15.560
<i>I feel the joy
that I felt in my childhood,</i>

35:15.640 --> 35:19.560
how it feels to sing because I like it.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.200
<i>Seoul is a place where</i>

35:45.280 --> 35:49.880
<i>different energies circulate
and influence me.</i>

35:50.720 --> 35:54.840
I often think that
if I hadn’t lived in Seoul,

35:55.400 --> 35:59.240
I would have been living a different life.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.960
<i>Because I’ve run Ungteori Tongdak
for a long time in Itaewon,</i>

36:06.040 --> 36:08.880
<i>it feels like we are living with
Seoul’s history.</i>

36:08.960 --> 36:12.720
And I still see new things even now!

36:17.520 --> 36:21.720
<i>Seoul is clearly fast-changing
but something inside…</i>

36:21.800 --> 36:25.640
the core identity of Seoul doesn’t change,
it is well preserved.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.000
That’s what makes the city
more attractive.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.760
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
