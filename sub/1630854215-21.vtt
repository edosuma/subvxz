00:01.035 --> 00:02.803
<i>Previously on</i>
The Good Doctor...

00:02.803 --> 00:05.906
Dalisay!
I know I didn't show you
enough respect,

00:05.906 --> 00:09.677
and I didn't make
enough effort to see things
from your point of view,

00:09.677 --> 00:11.011
but I want to change.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.446
How about dinner?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.515
You pick me up at 7:30,
Saturday.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.484
We can try that Filipino place.

00:16.484 --> 00:20.254
I think maybe you and I
could be gifts to each other.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.822
And we should be open to that.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.924
I have no idea what it looks
like for us to move forward.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.159
We'll figure it out.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.261
It's a perfect practice run
for when your own comes along.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.931
I'm going off my IVF meds.
I'm not doing another cycle.

00:30.931 --> 00:34.034
<i>Eden, she's what
I've been waiting for.
She's my daughter.</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.437
I thought it was Dr. Glassman's
cancer returning,

00:36.437 --> 00:40.174
but it is damage
to Dr. Glassman's brain
as a result of a mini-stroke.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.809
It is permanent.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.977
He shouldn't be
doing surgery anymore.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.349
Ah.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.351
Two weeks to Peanut Day!

00:50.351 --> 00:51.719
Yes.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.355
So you're making lasagna
for breakfast?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.124
It's going in the freezer.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.625
I've packed my hospital bag,

00:57.625 --> 00:58.826
written my Birth Plan,

00:58.826 --> 01:00.394
and soon all I'll have
on my list

01:00.394 --> 01:03.030
is to do my nails and relax.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.733
73% of births happen
before the due date,

01:05.733 --> 01:08.169
so you need to start
relaxing immediately.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.305
'Cause if there's one thing
you can cram, it's relaxation.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.373
Yes.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.211
Have you heard anything
from Glassy?

01:18.546 --> 01:20.314
Hmm. Oh. No.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.849
He might be mad
when he finds out

01:21.849 --> 01:24.084
you went to Lim
with his brain scans.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.187
It was very important
for his future,

01:26.187 --> 01:28.422
both medically
and professionally.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.757
Well, it's not
just the information.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.592
It's the whole
behind-his-back thing.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.495
He wouldn't listen to me,
so I had no choice.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.630
I think you did
the right thing, but...

01:37.965 --> 01:39.233
just talk to him?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.470
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.082
I've had a stroke.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.319
Yes. A small one.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.458
- I should probably
give you some time.
- Yeah, you should.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.802
He, uh, hit the brakes
instead of the gas

02:14.802 --> 02:16.804
and thumped his head
on the steering wheel.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.407
I'm a shoo-in for the Dumbest
Patient of the Day.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.808
Oh, it's too early
to hand that out.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.210
You want to hear
about a dumb patient?

02:22.210 --> 02:24.612
Doctor says to her
he's waiting for her X-ray.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.815
She says, "Well, that's weird.
I never dated
anybody named Ray."

02:27.815 --> 02:30.284
A little too early
for that, too.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.552
The laceration's
superficial.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.053
Couple stitches,
and you're good to go.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.722
- Yay!
- You sure?

02:34.722 --> 02:37.891
He hit his head pretty hard.
Maybe you should
run some tests?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.960
There's no sign of fracture,

02:39.960 --> 02:41.495
closed head injury,
or brain bleed.

02:45.766 --> 02:46.800
Dr. Murphy?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.340
It's not about the accident.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.576
He's been behaving
very strangely
for the last six months.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.479
Oh. He's alert, responsive,
engaging socially--

02:58.479 --> 03:00.581
Which is nothing like him.

03:00.581 --> 03:04.084
His whole life,
he's been... terrible.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.687
Constantly fired,
been through four divorces,

03:06.687 --> 03:09.022
estranged from all of his kids,
except me.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.659
He was always just... a dick.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.461
Then he changed.

03:13.461 --> 03:17.331
Now he's telling dad jokes,
asks about my day.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.732
He gave me a birthday present.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.936
He is a different person.

03:22.936 --> 03:27.841
This does not sound to me
like a medical issue.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.178
But I will order a brain MRI
because it would be
very interesting if it were!

03:46.760 --> 03:48.462
Are you mad at me

03:48.462 --> 03:49.897
for going to Dr. Lim

03:49.897 --> 03:51.098
with your brain scan?

03:52.199 --> 03:53.267
Yeah, a little bit.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.770
But maybe you
saved my life, so...

03:57.838 --> 03:59.340
I didn't think you were,

03:59.340 --> 04:00.408
but Lea said you might be,

04:00.408 --> 04:01.509
so we were both right.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.876
What are you going to do?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.213
About your job?

04:07.515 --> 04:08.582
I don't know, Shaun.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.151
I just found out
I had a stroke.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.587
I-I'm still reeling
a little bit.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.857
Maybe when I decide,

04:16.857 --> 04:18.258
I'll let you know.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.296
Okay.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.370
I hear it beating!

04:29.370 --> 04:31.038
Wow. Dr. Wolke has a heart?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.040
I wasn't sure myself,
to be honest.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.708
I have one, too.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.809
Now, that, we all knew.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.311
Hey, Nico.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.248
The doctors
are gonna take Olivia

04:41.248 --> 04:45.218
to get some ice cream
and you to get some tests.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.588
Followed, of course,
by some ice cream.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.990
- Thanks, Dr. Marcus.
- Yeah.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.293
Get some ice cream.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.071
Nico's sarcoma has invaded
his thigh and hip,
here and here.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.574
But luckily, there's
no signs of metastasis,

05:06.574 --> 05:09.877
which means we can
debulk the tumor.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.345
How much time
would that give him?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.915
Nine months, maybe even a year.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.286
We could take him to Salzburg.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.956
With Nico's illness
and all his surgeries,

05:22.956 --> 05:24.758
he's never really had
a great Christmas.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.261
He found this photo of
the Salzburg Christmas Market
in Austria.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.597
He talks about it all the time.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.866
This surgery could
just get us there.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.335
Not "just."

05:35.335 --> 05:37.137
Th-There's always
medical advances.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.273
We have to be realistic, Seb.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.543
And you have to keep
a positive attitude.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.313
This is good news.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.582
Some final pre-op testing,

05:48.582 --> 05:50.117
and Nico can have
his surgery tomorrow.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.088
Come on.
Be reasonable, please.

05:55.088 --> 05:59.026
You've been fed,
changed, swaddled.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.361
I have walked. I have rocked.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.697
I have bounced.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.067
I've worn you on my front,
on my back, on my hip.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.203
Shh.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.473
Please, Eden.
You have to go to sleep.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.374
Shh.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.611
Be reasonable, please. Shh.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.416
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.680
So... you gonna tell me or not?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.715
- Hmm?
- Where are we going
tomorrow?

06:54.715 --> 06:55.983
Oh, it's a surprise.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.117
Hmm.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.753
As in, you have no idea.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.390
It's been harder
than I thought.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.358
All right?
A movie's too predictable,

07:05.358 --> 07:06.860
an escape room is too dorky,

07:06.860 --> 07:09.697
and, well,
dinner at my place is out.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.766
I'll pick something.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.602
No, see, I don't want you
to deal with this.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.169
It's supposed to be fun, Danny,

07:16.169 --> 07:18.539
which it will be,
once we get over
this first hump.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.508
So let me do it, okay?

07:20.508 --> 07:21.875
And, yes, I said "hump,"

07:21.875 --> 07:24.111
which I regret saying
for multiple reasons.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.621
His daughter was right.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.528
I will take ace inhibitors,
aspirin, statins

07:40.528 --> 07:43.531
to help reduce the likelihood
of future stroke

07:43.531 --> 07:45.132
to near absolute zero.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.434
I will reduce
my workload by 25%.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.637
Any operation over six hours,

07:49.637 --> 07:51.772
I will have a backup in the OR.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.807
I will even eat more broccoli.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.545
I'm not really comfortable
with you

07:57.545 --> 07:58.812
doing any surgery right now,

07:58.812 --> 08:00.480
not until we've determined

08:00.480 --> 08:03.751
the full extent of any
potential impairment.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.385
Do I look impaired to you?

08:05.385 --> 08:07.721
No, but I think
we should run a few tests.

08:07.721 --> 08:12.159
Do you see any evidence at all
that my work has suffered?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.661
You are a brain surgeon.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.564
The margin of acceptable error
is miniscule.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.633
I have a pretty good idea
of how precise I need to be.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.101
I'm not comfortable
with subjecting

08:21.101 --> 08:22.536
any patient to that risk.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.806
Most of the patients
that I take on,

08:26.940 --> 08:29.176
other surgeons
won't even touch.

08:29.176 --> 08:34.147
Without me, the likelihood
that they will die is 100%.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.786
I am not questioning
your value.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.589
I'm just asking that you wait

08:41.589 --> 08:43.490
until there is no doubt.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.395
There's no such thing
as "no doubt."

08:51.699 --> 08:52.966
Aaron, I--

08:52.966 --> 08:55.035
I cannot have you
operating right now.

08:55.903 --> 08:56.970
I'm sorry.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.072
Then you will have to fire me.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.677
And I will sue you.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.954
You know, I'm thinking
of cooking up

09:13.954 --> 09:17.457
a batch of the world-famous
Poulet a la Andrews tonight.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.726
I'm in.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.860
Hmm.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.965
But I want to give you
a courtesy heads up.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.299
The nurses are gonna send out

09:26.299 --> 09:28.702
an official e-mail
about a unionization drive.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.504
I just increased
the nursing budget.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.572
More than a year ago.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.075
And it mostly went to temps
or traveling nurses.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.377
Not mostly.
I can show you the numbers.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.880
Point is, we're underpaid, underappreciated.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.682
A union could protect us.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.618
Sorry to interrupt.
Got Nico's pre-op testing back.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.220
His chemo
hit his bone marrow hard.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.023
Platelets only 22k?

09:51.524 --> 09:53.126
He can't have the surgery.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.869
You have a large malignant hemangiopericytoma

10:01.869 --> 10:03.771
compressing your frontal lobes.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.940
- Malignant?
- Yes.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.676
But it's operable.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.577
Which is good,
because if left untreated,

10:10.577 --> 10:13.446
this would likely kill you
within a year.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.249
- Okay.
- You were right.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.219
The tumor is probably why
your father stopped being

10:19.219 --> 10:20.988
"a dick" a few months ago.

10:22.923 --> 10:23.991
Sorry, Dad.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.128
It's all right.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.797
I knew our relationship
had improved.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.332
I just didn't know
it was because of <i>this.</i>

10:33.834 --> 10:37.637
So, if you remove it,
could that change
my personality back?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.306
Most likely.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.446
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm gonna pass on the surgery.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.626
If you want to bench
our top surgeon,

10:59.626 --> 11:02.229
you're gonna need more
than one indeterminate scan.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.332
Are you worried about
losing our top surgeon
or our top earner?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.901
Why does everyone think wanting
to keep this hospital solvent

11:07.901 --> 11:09.669
is something
to be embarrassed about?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.739
You want to open up the door
to another takeover?

11:11.739 --> 11:13.741
I just want to be clear
about our agenda.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.475
Well, then, let me clarify.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.410
Yes, I'm worried about
losing our top earner,

11:17.410 --> 11:19.612
but I'm more worried
about Theo Singh,

11:19.612 --> 11:22.482
the 27-year-old newlywed
with the pilocytic astrocytoma.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.351
We can refer him
to Dr. Cachoa at General.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.419
Theo's tumor is compressing
his brain stem.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.288
Cachoa probably
won't even take him.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.724
I can deal with that.
And you're doing it again.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.061
My department, my call.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.697
Once litigation is threatened,
it becomes <i>my</i> call.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.700
Glassman refused
cognitive testing,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.202
and until I have
more information,

11:42.202 --> 11:43.670
I'm not letting him
into the OR.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.009
So he does
all of his surgeries
as planned,

11:49.009 --> 11:50.778
but with a backstop.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.380
You assign another surgeon
on all of his cases

11:53.380 --> 11:54.614
and not just the OR.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.816
And he'll be happy with that?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.350
It's a compromise.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.986
Nobody's ever completely happy.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.054
- I know I'm not.
- Neither am I.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.256
The hallmark
of a successful negotiation.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.763
I forgot you were coming.

12:09.763 --> 12:13.967
That's odd, given how you read
my text ten minutes ago, but...

12:13.967 --> 12:16.669
Beautiful, healthy baby.
Beautiful and healthy mom.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.640
So it looks like
things are going great.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.674
Definitely.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.511
Is she eating well?

12:24.511 --> 12:26.713
- Like a horse. Shh, shh.
- Nice.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.215
- Sleeping?
- Like a baby.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.586
I underestimated diaper demand,
but everything else is...

12:33.586 --> 12:34.754
perfect.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.357
Shh. It's okay.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.060
When Kellan was fussy,
we'd put his car seat

12:40.060 --> 12:41.528
on top of the washing machine.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.831
The vibrations
knocked him right out.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.698
Well, this isn't like her.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.434
Okay. Shh.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.403
You mind?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.542
Ah. All right.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.512
Oh, I've missed this.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.916
What?

13:05.585 --> 13:06.719
See? Like a baby.

13:08.721 --> 13:09.756
What?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.762
My patient is refusing
the hemangiopericytoma

13:15.762 --> 13:17.430
resection surgery
that will save his life.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.366
I want you to talk him into it.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.434
That's not
how this works, Shaun.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.602
It should be.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.771
You are more persuasive
than I am.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.008
Ask Glassman.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.244
He's removed more
anterior fossa tumors
than anyone on the West Coast.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.981
But Dr. Glassman should not
be doing any surgery until--

13:33.981 --> 13:37.084
I agree, but I was overruled.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.386
If you want someone
to change your patient's mind,

13:39.386 --> 13:40.487
Glassman's your best shot.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.591
You <i>are</i> persuasive.

13:49.162 --> 13:53.100
Nico's body isn't making
the blood cells
and platelets he needs.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.236
There's, uh-- There's got to be
a way to get his counts up.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.504
With Nico so sick...

14:00.307 --> 14:02.876
it may be time to consider
palliative care.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.246
- No.
- Let's hear the doctor out.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.781
No, I'm not giving up on him.
Neither should you.

14:08.781 --> 14:09.816
And neither should they.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.886
Nico's been
through so much.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.821
You think I don't know that?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.191
I'm trying to save his life.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.797
Dr. Park will pull
the team together

14:24.797 --> 14:27.367
and see if there's a solution
that works for everyone.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.137
Thank you.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.238
So much.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.045
He doesn't want
his tumor removed,

14:38.045 --> 14:39.879
so I don't know
what there is to discuss.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.215
Given the tumor's impact
on his frontal lobes,

14:42.215 --> 14:44.317
he might not be competent
to make that decision.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.553
And you don't think
I'm competent to be
a doctor, so...

14:46.553 --> 14:48.355
Oh, no.
Just to be a neurosurgeon.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.524
The surgery should give Kurt
about 20 more years.

14:51.524 --> 14:55.128
Let's recap, 20 more years
as a bad father

14:55.128 --> 14:57.697
versus one year
as a good father.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.666
There is no
medical justification--

14:59.666 --> 15:00.968
Yes, there is, Shaun.
Yes, there is.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.670
There's an emotional one!
There's an emotional issue!

15:03.670 --> 15:07.307
Your voice is getting louder,
and your face is flushed.
Are you upset?

15:07.307 --> 15:08.908
You should have come to me
with the scan.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.978
You don't go to Lim.
You don't show it to Lim.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.513
You said you were
only a <i>little</i> mad at me.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.016
Y-You ratted me out
to the head of the department

15:16.016 --> 15:18.418
when I specifically
asked you not to do that!

15:18.418 --> 15:20.753
Yes, I did that because
you did not believe me--

15:20.753 --> 15:22.022
Well, then, you come to me!

15:22.022 --> 15:24.924
You try to convince me.
Again and again and again!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.559
Don't you think
you owe me that?

15:26.559 --> 15:29.029
That's four times.
I tried a lot more than that.

15:35.635 --> 15:36.970
What do you want from me?

15:36.970 --> 15:38.738
You want me to go with you
to see if he's competent?
Is that it?

15:38.738 --> 15:41.074
Okay. Fine. Let's go.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.213
Hey.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.281
Did Dr. Park find anything?

15:49.249 --> 15:50.883
Not yet.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.619
I just wanted to see
how you guys are doing.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.888
Seb's with the kids.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.258
I, um, needed a little break.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.773
Seb and I used to talk
about how every day was a--

16:13.773 --> 16:14.907
A beautiful day.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.910
I remember.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.819
Do you understand
what will happen

16:26.819 --> 16:28.388
if you don't have
the operation?

16:28.388 --> 16:31.124
Yes. I'll be dead
within a year.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.960
And why is that
preferable to surgery?

16:35.928 --> 16:36.963
Hailey was right about me.

16:36.963 --> 16:40.333
I was a terrible person,
a terrible father.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.736
Never played with her.
I hardly talked to her.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.205
I can't even remember
holding her hand.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.043
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

16:52.279 --> 16:54.781
I was five, terrified
of the flying monkeys,

16:54.781 --> 16:55.848
but when I reached
for your hand...

16:56.516 --> 16:57.717
I pulled it away.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.620
I never tried to again.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.324
I don't want to go back.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.500
I don't want to lose this.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.868
I don't want to lose <i>you.</i>

17:21.508 --> 17:23.042
The brain is a funny thing.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.945
It wants to do the things
that makes it feel good,

17:25.945 --> 17:27.214
get that dopamine hit.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.783
In fact, it actually
can reshape itself

17:30.783 --> 17:34.954
as it continues to try
to experience
those good feelings.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.357
So you're saying I m-might...

17:38.558 --> 17:39.559
be able to stay this way?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.697
Maybe.

17:44.697 --> 17:49.068
You work hard
to be the best version
of the person you want to be.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.203
I've had that fight.

17:51.104 --> 17:54.174
You should listen
to Dr. Glassman.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.977
And he has removed
more anterior fossa tumors

17:57.977 --> 18:00.247
than anyone on the West Coast.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.684
Hey, I have faith in you, Dad.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.053
You can do the work.
You could stay a good man.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.358
Whew.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.094
Well, uh,
like the patient said,

18:15.962 --> 18:17.264
"I didn't want brain surgery,

18:17.264 --> 18:19.199
but the doctor
changed my mind."

18:22.202 --> 18:24.737
That... was a dad joke?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.373
And a "yes."

18:26.373 --> 18:28.107
If <i>you</i> do the surgery.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.080
I've heard that you,
uh, know your way
around a fossa tumor.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.117
As you wish.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.331
- So, what are we doing here?
- You don't remember?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.402
A bicoronal
subfrontal craniotomy.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.970
- And?
- Possible orbital osteotomies.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.072
Drill.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.975
We would place
a lumbar drain first.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.646
Before incision, yes.
I thought I'd focus
on the surgery.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.283
Be careful
of the sutura coronalis.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.918
Why? Does the patient
have one of those?

19:11.918 --> 19:14.254
All higher primates do.
If you don't remember--

19:14.254 --> 19:16.589
That was a joke. In the OR,
we call that a joke.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.090
Hmm.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.328
Popping the top.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.438
- And let's get under the lobes.
- Wait.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.073
That is not
the next step. It's--

19:34.073 --> 19:37.310
Assessing and ligating
the anterior third.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.879
I thought I'd do that
after I get a better view.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.014
That...

19:42.815 --> 19:44.917
is an acceptable option.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.985
Wonderful.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.356
But you must remember to--

19:49.356 --> 19:51.157
Shaun, no more talking
while I'm doing this procedure.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.592
This is my patient,
so I should be able to--

19:52.592 --> 19:53.993
Shaun, I'm asking you to leave.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.362
I will be quiet,
but if another--

19:55.362 --> 19:57.163
One of us
is going to leave, Shaun.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.366
It's not gonna be the one
doing the surgery.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.544
Let's get after it.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.948
We'd start
with blood transfusions,

20:15.948 --> 20:17.550
plus a cocktail
of five medications

20:17.550 --> 20:19.319
to ramp up production
of blood cells.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.454
That should get Nico
through the operation.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.622
A few weeks later,
we'd follow up

20:22.622 --> 20:24.691
with a stem-cell
transplantation
from one of you.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.860
What could the side effects be?

20:27.860 --> 20:30.062
Elevated risk of infection
and bleeds from the surgery

20:30.062 --> 20:32.699
and possible toxicity
from drug interactions.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.703
You know the alternative.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.205
He'd be gone
in just a few months.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.243
If you were in our place,
what would you do?

20:50.483 --> 20:51.551
I'd do the surgery.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.190
- Okay.
- Thank you.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.927
Thank you.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.363
We'll prep Nico for surgery.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.368
Okay.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.238
If this works,
it'll be a real win-win

21:12.238 --> 21:15.107
because one day
I do plan to do laundry again.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.860
All right, Eden.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.296
I'm just gonna sit down
for one sec.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.909
No! No.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.248
That'll stay just between us.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.360
I want Shaun off the case.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.729
It's his patient.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.163
I don't want to crack
a man's skull open

22:11.163 --> 22:12.565
while standing next to someone

22:12.565 --> 22:14.401
who's waiting
for me to screw up.

22:14.401 --> 22:18.004
I want a team I can trust 100%
and who will trust me.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.742
- Shaun's off the case.
- Thank you.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.110
And <i>I'll</i> be assisting.

22:29.782 --> 22:30.917
Welcome aboard.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.964
This is nice.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.436
Are you talking
about the chicken?

22:49.436 --> 22:51.671
Not exclusively.

22:54.574 --> 22:58.210
I just hope it doesn't get
messed up by things at work.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.147
The unionization drive.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.854
What if I could
squeeze the board?

23:07.854 --> 23:11.724
Get them to sign off
on some real and meaningful improvements.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.126
You might not
even need a union.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.362
Those would have to be
some pretty big concessions.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.331
Okay.

23:20.833 --> 23:24.136
How about a 5% raise,

23:24.136 --> 23:27.874
1-to-4 cap
on nurse-to-patient ratios.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.943
Might even be able
to get a Chief Nursing Officer
on the board.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.047
That's pretty interesting.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.351
I have no idea if anyone else
would go for it.

23:42.622 --> 23:43.923
Any chance you could find out?

23:45.858 --> 23:47.694
Well, there's a big difference
how hard I can push

23:47.694 --> 23:49.696
for a proposal that might work
versus one that will.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.300
I could float it
to a couple people.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.202
Yeah?

23:56.202 --> 23:57.303
Yeah.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.340
Dessert?

24:01.340 --> 24:02.374
Yes.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.816
As soon as the surgery's over,
the case is yours again.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.921
I will watch from the gallery.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.256
No need.
I'll have a much better
view from the floor.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.627
The video feed on the monitors
is excellent.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.929
And it couldn't hurt
to have more backup.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.598
Actually, it could, Shaun.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.668
I was wrong,
sending you to Glassman.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.872
He's pretty upset right now,
and if you push it,

24:32.872 --> 24:34.406
it could really hurt
your relationship.

24:34.406 --> 24:37.577
But if a doctor
is making mistakes--

24:37.577 --> 24:39.411
You don't have to be
the one to catch them,

24:39.411 --> 24:40.747
not when others can.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.217
Not when the doctor
is your dad.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.194
There we go. There we go.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.336
Come on. I have a few left.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.138
It's okay. Don't worry.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.473
Okay.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.042
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No!

25:11.177 --> 25:12.612
I knew I was running out!
I knew it.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.514
What kind of mom
runs out of diapers?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.650
Morgan?

25:23.455 --> 25:26.025
Eden, if you're alone,
open the door!

25:36.002 --> 25:38.270
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.006
I'm failing at everything.

25:48.147 --> 25:51.183
You know, when Kellan
was three months,

25:51.183 --> 25:53.720
Mia had to go out of town.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.357
It was my first time
alone with him,
and he was teething.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.861
It was 4:00 in the morning,
and neither of us had slept.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.529
And suddenly...

26:03.529 --> 26:05.064
Hmm.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.166
I knew exactly
how to fix everything.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.271
One, or both, of us
was going out that window.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.877
No one went out the window.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.212
We both fell asleep.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.083
Of the many times I've heard
about your failures,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.685
none has ever made me happier.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.722
You're not failing.
You're just, uh...
muddling through.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.324
I am <i>not</i> a muddler.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.693
Mm. Every parent is.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.596
Key is to not lose your mind
while you're muddling.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.633
What?

26:43.703 --> 26:45.504
I've freed up
the lateral aspect.

26:45.504 --> 26:46.773
Cauterizing.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.743
We're ready
to take out the tumor.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.879
Dr. Kalu, you want the honor?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.648
Thank you, Doctor.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.124
There's mets
all over his liver.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.363
Can we resect
the most involved segments?

27:11.363 --> 27:13.065
It's too widespread.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.836
So... what do we do?

27:19.839 --> 27:22.608
We close him up
and tell the family.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.588
Start the timer.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.102
Place the lumbar drain, please.

28:02.448 --> 28:03.816
Hey.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.485
- Tough day?
- Yeah, it was.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.388
When I was arguing
with the board
and fighting with Lim and...

28:12.358 --> 28:14.593
I just found out
I got to tell a kid's parents

28:14.593 --> 28:16.628
that a surgery
I recommended failed

28:16.628 --> 28:19.866
and their boy
has a month to live. So...

28:19.866 --> 28:21.834
that tipped it
a bit beyond "tough."

28:24.070 --> 28:25.371
I'll come back later.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.873
No. Look. I'm sorry. I'm okay.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.175
What's up?

28:29.175 --> 28:31.744
- This may not be the time.
- No. It's fine.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.017
I floated your idea
to a few nurses.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.321
They don't trust perks that
can be taken away at will.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.157
They want a union. I'm sorry.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.559
Which nurses?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.797
- Their names?
- Yeah.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.698
You're asking me to inform
on my co-workers?

28:52.698 --> 28:54.166
I just need to know
how serious this is.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.534
Are we talking
influential people

28:55.534 --> 28:57.436
or some disgruntled
part-timers?

29:16.122 --> 29:17.890
<i>No!</i>

29:17.890 --> 29:19.358
<i>You need to use
a Penfield dissector</i>

29:19.358 --> 29:21.193
<i>to avoid lacerating
the sagittal sinus.</i>

29:21.193 --> 29:25.064
Dr. Murphy!
- I'm using the blunt end
of the drill bit instead.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.902
<i>Okay. Carry on.</i>

29:29.902 --> 29:33.772
Well, thank you.
Speak again, Dr. Murphy,
and I'll have you removed.

29:40.579 --> 29:43.282
I heard you were here,
and I said, "Impossible,

29:43.282 --> 29:44.783
because Lea and I talked about

29:44.783 --> 29:48.120
how this is her very precious
and finite me-time."

29:48.120 --> 29:49.889
Tonight's the big date
with Perez, right?

29:49.889 --> 29:51.057
- Mm-hmm.
- What are you gonna do?

29:51.057 --> 29:52.624
I have no idea.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.293
I thought of
this Italian place,

29:54.293 --> 29:56.728
but then I remembered they have
house wine on the tables

29:56.728 --> 29:58.597
and figured
that might trigger a relapse.

29:58.597 --> 30:01.968
And then I thought
of indoor skydiving,
but what if he gets hurt?

30:01.968 --> 30:04.803
- So I--
- You're really
overthinking this.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.039
I thought maybe
he wasn't ready to date,

30:07.039 --> 30:09.375
but now I'm thinking I'm not.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.711
Maybe you're not,
but you're really
gonna regret it

30:12.711 --> 30:15.047
if you don't give it a shot.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.249
Take him to the Batumi Grill,
order the khachapuri.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.286
Now my Slanket is waiting.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.490
Khachapuri. Okay.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.894
- You're giving up?
- That's not what we--

30:27.894 --> 30:29.828
You can't do this to us,
to him.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.397
I'm so sorry, Sebastian.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.966
You can't promise
that you have a cure for my boy
and then abandon us.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.135
- There's nothing we can do.
- So find another surgery.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.938
We need to focus
on improving the quality
of the time Nico has left.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.673
Do not tell me where to focus.
He's my son.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.276
I don't-- I don't--
I don't want quality time.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.644
- All I want is my boy.
- Seb.

30:45.644 --> 30:48.147
- I'm talking to him.
- You're being selfish.

30:50.316 --> 30:53.452
Forcing any more operations
will only cause Nico more pain,

30:53.452 --> 30:55.687
and you and Talia and Olivia

30:55.687 --> 30:57.489
will have terrible memories
of his last days.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.391
I don't care about memories.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.293
You should.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.931
Because soon
they are all you'll have.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.336
Hey.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.371
You wouldn't let me
give up before.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.840
And you were right.

31:18.744 --> 31:19.878
But now it's time.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.392
Dads are supposed to
fight for their kids.

31:34.593 --> 31:35.861
So you fight...

31:37.529 --> 31:40.532
to give your son
as many beautiful days
as you can.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.472
You need a rest?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.209
No. Just stretching.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.946
Okay.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.119
And there is our houseguest.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.091
Having overstayed his welcome.

32:41.927 --> 32:45.031
There's a lot of bleeding.
Vascular clips.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.299
Must be a tear
in the anterior cerebrals.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.769
No,
it's from the dural feeders.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.338
Hmm. As expected.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.744
And there we are. Hmm.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.512
Oh,
the bleeding's stopped.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.514
Nice.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.331
<i>No!</i>

33:19.331 --> 33:22.301
<i>Dr. Glassman, please tell us
what the next step is.</i>

33:22.301 --> 33:23.469
<i>You hesitated.</i>

33:23.469 --> 33:25.571
<i>You need to say
what comes next in the surgery.</i>

33:25.571 --> 33:28.174
Somebody please call security.
Shaun, you are out of line.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.341
Answer.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.179
Please.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.463
It's, um...

34:15.020 --> 34:16.788
We need to decompress
the optic nerve.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.023
Rhoton dissectors.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.277
Hey.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.748
The patient's in recovery.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.388
Your surgical plan
was flawless.

34:56.695 --> 34:57.963
Alison Borden.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.866
34-year-old mother of two.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.202
My first solo surgery.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.939
Frontal AVM.
It was a walk in the park.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.708
I was pumped. I was flying.

35:12.644 --> 35:16.382
And then...
her feeding artery tore...

35:17.616 --> 35:19.151
and I couldn't stop
the bleeding.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.456
Bipolaring, clipping, suturing.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.893
We thought we were
gonna lose her.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.832
And I couldn't get
this image out of my mind

35:35.133 --> 35:37.269
of her kids
coming home from school

35:37.269 --> 35:42.073
and seeing their father
just sitting there, you know?

35:47.145 --> 35:52.718
Finally, I stuck a neuro-patty
on a muscle patch graft.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.119
That did it. It held.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.957
And when I walked
out of that OR,

35:58.957 --> 36:01.860
I thought, "I am never
going back in there again."

36:08.133 --> 36:10.068
Then I saw Alison in recovery.

36:10.068 --> 36:12.271
Husband, kids. All smiles.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.373
She gave me a big hug.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.145
Despite my raging ego...

36:22.781 --> 36:24.383
I've tried-- I've always tried

36:25.984 --> 36:27.519
to make it about the patients.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.690
To do what's best for them.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.167
I never thought that would mean
putting <i>down</i> my knife.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.020
The surgery
went very well.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.690
We were able to completely
remove your tumor.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.860
Hey. Dad. How are you feeling?

37:11.563 --> 37:12.731
Well, my head kind of hurts.

37:13.565 --> 37:14.933
I bet.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.182
I gave you that locket.

37:32.784 --> 37:33.785
Yeah.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.221
For my last birthday.

37:37.523 --> 37:38.557
Yeah.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.428
Yeah, that seems like
a long time ago.

So, where we heading?

39:12.283 --> 39:15.421

39:17.489 --> 39:19.024
I have no idea what that is.

Amazing.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.080
Wow.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.950
Hey. Do you think maybe...

40:19.851 --> 40:21.453
We can do dinner another night.

Oh! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

40:39.104 --> 40:42.841
No, like,
I <i>really</i> like the suit.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.777

come home tonight?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.446
Ho, ho... ho.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.230
It's a beautiful day.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.905
Kurt and Hailey held hands.

41:17.342 --> 41:19.811
It must be hard to accept
you are compromised,

41:19.811 --> 41:21.312
but you did not hurt a patient,

41:21.312 --> 41:23.114
so now you understand
why I did it,

41:23.114 --> 41:24.616
and you can't be mad at me.

41:24.616 --> 41:27.418
You didn't have to do it
that way, okay?

41:27.418 --> 41:30.288
You were right.
You didn't have to
do it that way.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.924
- But if I was right, then--
- You humiliated me in public.

41:32.924 --> 41:37.095
In my operating room,
in front of my colleagues.

41:37.095 --> 41:40.198
Do you have any idea
how much that hurt,
coming from you?

41:48.974 --> 41:50.275
I don't know what to do.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.013
You could just leave me alone.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.421
Hello? Lea?

42:03.421 --> 42:05.056

42:09.961 --> 42:12.130
