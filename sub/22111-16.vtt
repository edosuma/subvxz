WEBVTT

00:03.525 --> 00:06.745
Who is Anatoli Kirkin again?Deeks's bathhouse buddy.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.095
He'd rather sell out
his own gangs

00:08.138 --> 00:09.400
than join them in prison.

00:09.444 --> 00:12.055
Anatoli Kirkin,
you've won a 30-day head start

00:12.099 --> 00:13.404
from the Russian mob.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.842
Marty, when I get set up,
I will send for you.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.235
CALLEN: Pavel Volkoff poisoned Katarina

00:18.279 --> 00:20.020
'cause he knew
he could lure my dad out.

00:21.934 --> 00:24.241
You're a grandfather.You're an uncle.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.896
Agent Callen.
Mr. Garrison.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.071
I made lasagna for dinner.
I should probably...

00:28.115 --> 00:29.725
Why don't,
why don't we come back?

00:29.768 --> 00:31.683
Do you want to stay?That sounds wonderful.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.946
We'd love to.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.603
NIKITA:
Please stop.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.344
I surrender.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.912
Just spare my family. Please.

00:42.955 --> 00:46.133
I amyour family, Grandpa.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.308
Jake...

00:47.351 --> 00:49.092
you must remember--

00:49.136 --> 00:50.963
never drop your guard.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.708
Oh.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.844
Honestly, I can't tell
how much is play

01:01.887 --> 01:03.585
and how much is training.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.282
Now reload.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.328
I'm timing you.

01:07.371 --> 01:10.200
Yep. The point
is he cares.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.637
Yeah. And Jake loves him.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.117
He does.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.119
Yeah, I didn't know
what to expect

01:16.163 --> 01:18.165
when you two
first showed up, but...

01:18.208 --> 01:19.862
...he's happy.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.298
Good.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.083
And what about you, huh?

01:23.126 --> 01:24.954
When am I gonna get
to see Anna again?Hmm.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.174
: You only brought her
over for dinner once.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.131
I know. I know.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.829
ATF has her completely tied up.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.135
Well, I like her.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.355
She kind of reminds me
of my mom.
Okay,

01:34.398 --> 01:36.400
that's not weird, is it: Why?

01:36.444 --> 01:38.098
It's not like
it's yourmom.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.752
Besides, my mom was a hottie,
so just take the compliment.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.320
Okay?All right, I'll pass that on.
I know she likes you as well.

01:43.364 --> 01:46.193
Oh, shoot. Jake,
you're gonna be late for school.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.238
Oy.Yeah, I should
probably go to work.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.197
Um... okay.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.199
NIKITA: Alexandra,
I will take care of it.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.200
Thank you.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.201
Okay, buddy.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.593
Bye, Grandpa.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.160
All right.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.945
Thanks, Dad.
See you tonight. Mwah.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.425
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.948
Later, buddy.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.602
See you.Okay, bye-bye.

02:08.389 --> 02:11.174
Nothing... from my only son?

02:11.218 --> 02:13.307
I'll see you later.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.395
Be safe.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.831
I will.

02:15.874 --> 02:19.182
MAN: Ma'am, will you
please send your father out?

02:19.226 --> 02:20.836
ALEX: I don't understand.
Has he done something?

02:20.879 --> 02:22.098
Excuse me.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.404
Is there a problem?

02:23.447 --> 02:25.406
Agent Callen. Brian Bush,
State Department.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.843
These men are with the
Diplomatic Security Service.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.975
Will you please send
your father out?

02:30.019 --> 02:32.195
What is this about?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.631
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.459
But your father needs to
come with us right now.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.852
They can't do that.
Callen...

02:36.895 --> 02:38.245
Hold on.
He's not going anywhere

02:38.288 --> 02:39.898
till you answer my question.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.249
We have a warrant to enter
the premises and remove him.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.293
Please stand aside.

02:43.337 --> 02:46.078
No one is going any...Agent Callen!

02:46.122 --> 02:47.428
Mommy...It's okay, it's okay.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.865
NIKITA:
Grisha!

02:49.908 --> 02:52.433
I will go with them.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.014
♪

03:26.945 --> 03:28.469
Kens?

03:28.512 --> 03:29.905
Did you justleave
the locker room?

03:29.948 --> 03:31.776
We finished working out
20 minutes ago.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.082
I need you to look at something,

03:33.125 --> 03:34.910
and I need you
not to freak out about it.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.694
Ha-ha. I don't like where
this is going already.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.043
I'm serious.
I'm losing my mind here.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.828
I need you to look at this.
Will you do that?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.482
Yeah. Okay. What?
What's going on?

03:41.525 --> 03:43.266
All right, just don't freak out.Okay.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.964
What...  what is that?

03:48.489 --> 03:49.968
Ew. That's a hair.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.927
Yeah, I know it's a hair.
What color is that hair?

03:51.970 --> 03:54.451
Well, it's kind of gr...

03:54.495 --> 03:56.105
Yeah.Oh.

03:56.148 --> 03:59.064
And I am too young and I am too
full of life to be turning gray.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.501
Sweetie, it's just one hair.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.937
It's no big deal.
Doesn't mean anything.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.679
Okay, well, tell that
to Clifford Jeremiah Deeks.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.071
I'm sorry, who?

04:06.115 --> 04:07.334
My Grandpappy.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.336
He was gray at 30,
he was bald at 40.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.294
I've seen my future--
it's gray and then it's bald.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.122
And then he also has
these weird creepy earlobes

04:13.165 --> 04:14.515
that hang down really low
like this,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.299
and just kind of flop around
when he walks.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.344
I don't want that!

04:17.387 --> 04:18.388
Okay, well, if-if...

04:18.432 --> 04:20.042
You know what?
All good to know

04:20.085 --> 04:21.652
before we get married
and procreate.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.524
At this rate, I'm gonna be bald
by the time we get married.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.047
I mean, this little dude
just fell right out.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.048
Wait, it fell out?

04:26.091 --> 04:27.397
Yeah.You didn't pull it out?

04:27.441 --> 04:28.920
No. No, no. It just fell,

04:28.964 --> 04:29.965
like the first leaf of autumn.

04:30.008 --> 04:33.098
Babe, this is a dog hair.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.186
Okay, now you're
just being mean.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.188
No, no. I'm-- look.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.973
This is, this is
Monty's little gray hair.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.367
I found him sleeping
on your pillow during the night.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.020
This is Monty's hair?Yes.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.587
See? No big deal.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.068
Your hair is safe for now.
But, but... if those earlobes

04:46.111 --> 04:47.417
do this thing, wedding's off.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.636
CALLEN:
Yeah, it just happened.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.551
I don't know where
they took him.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.074
I don't know.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.816
That's why I'm calling.
Are you gonna help me or not?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.777
SAM: Okay, but why is Iran involved?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.388
Well, we're not
exactly sure.

05:01.431 --> 05:02.693
What's going on?

05:02.737 --> 05:04.478
Callen's father
was picked up

05:04.521 --> 05:06.088
by the State Department
this morning.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.743
They took him from Alex's house.Why?

05:08.786 --> 05:10.092
ERIC:
We were just going over that.

05:10.135 --> 05:13.095
This is Ann and Jeremy Tyler.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.618
They're husband and wife
freelance photographers.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.316
Yeah, I've seen them on the
news-- they got picked up

05:16.359 --> 05:18.056
while traveling through
Iran last month.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.103
Well, the Iranians claim
that they are CIA spies.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.060
They're not.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.584
Who is he
talking to?

05:23.627 --> 05:25.629
Sabatino.
ERIC: It wouldn't
be the first time

05:25.673 --> 05:28.719
Iran made false claims
about captured U.S. citizens.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.069
So what does this have to do
with Callen's father?

05:31.113 --> 05:32.636
Well, here's where
things get weird.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.856
According to our contacts
at the State Department,

05:34.899 --> 05:37.162
Iran has agreed to
release the couple,

05:37.206 --> 05:39.991
but they've made a
rather unusual request.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.819
They want Callen's
father in return.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.909
What? I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.128
Was he operating
out of Iran

05:46.171 --> 05:48.130
while he was working
for the KGB?

05:48.173 --> 05:49.610
What's the
connection here?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.438
This has nothing to do
with Iran; they're merely pawns.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.397
The real player is Russia,
specifically Pavel Volkoff.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.791
Great.
ERIC:
Volkoff is

05:56.834 --> 05:59.402
currently the head of FSB,
Russia's Security Service.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.709
He's the second most
powerful man in Russia.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.711
CALLEN:
And an old enemy of my dad's.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.104
Volkoff must see
this capturing of the Tylers

06:06.148 --> 06:08.629
as an opportunity
to get some revenge finally.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.631
Maybe he even ordered
the capture.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.111
But how did he get Iran
to cooperate?

06:13.155 --> 06:15.200
Well, according to Sabatino,
Volkoff is leveraging

06:15.244 --> 06:17.986
a shipment of Russian missiles
to the Iranian military.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.771
Iran relies on those shipments
to maintain its armed forces.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.338
He's got 'em where it hurts.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.774
Okay, how do
we stop this?

06:23.818 --> 06:25.776
I mean, does Hetty
have contacts at State?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.125
Can she pull
some strings?

06:27.169 --> 06:29.998
Agent Blye, Hetty
is not the only one

06:30.041 --> 06:31.695
who has contacts at State.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.916
Where do you think this
information came from?All right.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.134
Well, we need more
than information.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.527
They need to know
what's really going on,

06:37.571 --> 06:39.137
that we are being played
by a major foreign player.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.835
MOSELY: They already know
that, Agent Callen,

06:40.878 --> 06:42.489
but it doesn't matter.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.883
The trade has been approved and
scheduled for two days from now.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.885
The decision came
from the highest level

06:47.929 --> 06:49.234
of our government.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.062
I can't stop it.
Hetty can't stop it.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.499
You can't stop it.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.023
And any attempt on our
part will be considered

06:55.066 --> 06:56.285
an act of treason.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.377
I'm sorry.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.389
Callen went to try
to see his father.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.001
So how we gonna stop this trade?
What's the plan?

07:17.045 --> 07:19.090
SAM: There is no plan.KENSI: So we're supposed to just

07:19.134 --> 07:20.135
sit here and do nothing?

07:20.178 --> 07:21.876
Did you talk to Hetty?I did.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.792
And?She agrees with Mosley.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.447
It's out our hands.
Nothing she can do.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.015
Hey. We have a case.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.103
You got to be kidding me.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.801
No. Stolen weapons
from Pendleton.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.281
A Lieutenant Chambers will be
meeting you in the boatshed.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.894
Duty calls.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.731
Can't get away from me
that easy, Brian.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.907
Yes, I heard you
wanted to see me.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.474
So you snuck away.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.954
Well,
that tells me a lot about you.

07:56.998 --> 07:59.087
This is pointless,
Agent Callen.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.176
I've already told you,
I can't discuss

08:01.219 --> 08:03.483
the circumstances
of your father's detention.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.136
Okay, then I will.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.096
In two days, my father's gonna
be traded to Russia via Iran

08:08.139 --> 08:09.271
so that you
can bring back

08:09.314 --> 08:11.142
a couple of
freelance photographers.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.361
Is that about right?

08:12.404 --> 08:14.102
Take the next
one, please.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.146
Okay.

08:17.192 --> 08:20.108
I'm afraid this is gonna be
a very short conversation.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.545
See, the Tylers--
innocent Americans

08:22.589 --> 08:25.200
with two daughters waiting
for them at home.

08:25.243 --> 08:28.551
Now, Nikita Reznikov--
he's a former KGB officer,

08:28.595 --> 08:32.207
residing in the U.S.
on a conditional visa.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.166
Now, I'm sure if this wasn't a
personal matter, Agent Callen,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.125
that you'd make
the same choice.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.127
He has a family, too.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.695
It's not fair to them.We disagree.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.088
You know, up till now,
the Bureau has chosen

08:44.132 --> 08:46.569
to ignore the fact
that your father was KGB.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.832
It also had chosen
to ignore the fact

08:48.876 --> 08:50.834
that the son of a KGB officer

08:50.878 --> 08:53.402
somehow became an
NCIS special agent.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.838
Now...

08:54.882 --> 08:56.100
from where I'm standing,

08:56.144 --> 08:58.233
we've been more than fair.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.801
But if you persist...

09:00.844 --> 09:02.803
that will change.

09:02.846 --> 09:06.415
And I have a feeling that
won't end well for you.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.417
Or the little lady
that hired you.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.419
I want to see him.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.595
I can't allow that.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.380
Look, go be with your
family, Agent Callen.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.034
There's nothing to be done.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.042
Listen, I get it--
stolen guns from Pendleton.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.609
It's just this
is bad timing.

09:26.653 --> 09:27.915
Let's just
get this over with.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.265
Lieutenant Chambers is
gonna be here any minute.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.094
She already is.

09:33.137 --> 09:36.445
Trudy Chambers was
an old alias of mine.

09:36.488 --> 09:40.623
Although she never achieved
the rank of lieutenant.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.407
So no stolen weapons then?

09:44.105 --> 09:47.021
I'm glad to see that
you've retained your...

09:47.064 --> 09:50.067
detective skills in my absence,

09:50.111 --> 09:51.460
Mr. Deeks.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.244
What? No, I knew it
the whole time.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.724
I was just talking
about Sam over here.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.770
You should've seen the look
of surprise on his face.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.988
It was priceless.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.337
It was so funny.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.252
Who do you think
set this up?

10:01.296 --> 10:02.776
Yeah?Ah.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.473
I called Hetty.

10:04.516 --> 10:07.084
Had Eric provide
an official cover.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.217
Hold on a second. Does this mean
we're gonna help Callen's dad?

10:09.260 --> 10:12.133
This is great.
What's the plan?

10:14.048 --> 10:16.093
Wait, you do have
a plan, don't you?

10:16.137 --> 10:17.660
Do you not have a plan?

10:17.704 --> 10:20.968
We will, Mr. Deeks, we will.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.884
You are going to sit here,

10:23.927 --> 10:28.236
drink this tea, and...

10:28.279 --> 10:30.107
work the problem.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.327
And also,

10:32.370 --> 10:35.243
there's $100,000 in here,

10:35.286 --> 10:37.114
in case you should need it.

10:37.158 --> 10:40.465
Courtesy of, uh,
my recent liquidation.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.033
Mosley could be a problem.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.339
It's only a
matter of time

10:44.382 --> 10:46.123
before she checks on our case.

10:46.167 --> 10:50.214
Let me worry
about the assistant director.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.042
You...

10:52.086 --> 10:54.871
just find a way.

10:54.915 --> 10:59.136
Failure is not an option.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.968
He has so many toys,
and these guns are his favorite.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.405
Right? Why-why does, why do
they have to like guns so much?

11:07.449 --> 11:09.364
Why can't he play
with hisAlex.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.582
Or

11:10.626 --> 11:12.236
Why is it always
all about guns, huh?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.716
Alex, do you understand...He never played with them

11:13.760 --> 11:15.326
until he met you and Dad.
Did you know that?

11:15.370 --> 11:18.286
Do you understand
what I just told you?

11:18.329 --> 11:20.027
Uh...

11:20.070 --> 11:22.072
Yeah. Yes.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.900
Sorry, I-I didn't...

11:23.944 --> 11:25.380
It's okay.I didn't mean that, I...

11:25.423 --> 11:26.381
It's okay.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.382
It's not. I'm...

11:27.425 --> 11:30.298
I'm grateful for you,

11:30.341 --> 11:32.692
for Dad,
for coming into our lives,

11:32.735 --> 11:35.520
but it-it hasn't been easy.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.568
You weren't even there
for the really painful part.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.267
Those months after Jake
lost his grandmother, he was...

11:44.486 --> 11:46.009
He didn't eat.

11:46.053 --> 11:49.273
I mean, what... what kind of
seven

11:49.317 --> 11:51.928
And now you're telling me that
he might lose his grandpa, too?

11:51.972 --> 11:53.756
I mean, he's up there--
he cried himself to sleep.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.236
I had to lie to him,
and tell him that...

11:55.279 --> 11:56.498
Alex, I promise you, that I...

11:56.541 --> 11:57.586
No. No promises.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.763
People break promises.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.939
Just, you get this done, Callen.

12:02.983 --> 12:05.246
Whatever it takes, whatever you
need to do to stop this trade,

12:05.289 --> 12:06.943
you just, you do it.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.252
Don't make me regret
letting you in.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.521
Hey, Eric, I'm looking
at the case control log,

12:19.564 --> 12:22.524
and I don't see an ROI open
for the Pendleton theft.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.747
Where are Beale and Jones?

12:36.277 --> 12:38.235
Hidoko's calling.
What should I do?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.671
Don't answer.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.412
Where are we going?

12:41.456 --> 12:43.240
Eric, you're supposed to be
trying to figure that out.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.807
Come on, let's go!

12:44.851 --> 12:47.418
And do it quickly, because
this thing guzzles gas faster

12:47.462 --> 12:49.943
than my Uncle Ned
and his bottle of brandy.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.509
Okay.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.645
Here we go, option number one,
let's hear it.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.473
KENSI:
Number one, we drop into Iran,

12:58.516 --> 12:59.996
rescue the Tylers
before they make the trade.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.476
That's a long shot.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.869
And it could start a war.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.261
DEEKS:
Plus, treason.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.568
SAM:
Uh, option two,

13:06.611 --> 13:08.439
we-we fake Nikita's death.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.614
Doesn't help the Tylers.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.181
Again, treason.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.140
Option number three,
we infiltrate the FSB,

13:13.183 --> 13:14.445
and assassinate Volkoff.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.839
Which still leaves the Tylers
out of luck.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.841
Oh, yeah, and treason.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.365
Yeah, with a side
of nuclear winter.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.454
Guys, let me just float this
once more...

13:23.498 --> 13:24.586
KENSI:
No.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.370
No, we are not
going undercover

13:26.414 --> 13:28.416
as a science-fiction
film crew.

13:28.459 --> 13:29.591
That was a movie, Eric.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.854
That was based on true events.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.638
Won Best Picture.Okay, how is this helping?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.336
I'm just stating that...

13:35.379 --> 13:36.685
All right, I'm
gonna stop talking.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.295
Thank you.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.428
We have been going at this
for two hours,

13:40.471 --> 13:42.430
and we still don't have
a solution.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.300
Kobayashi Maru.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.867
No-win scenario.

13:44.911 --> 13:45.955
I don't accept that.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.522
We'll find a way, or make one.

13:47.565 --> 13:48.915
That's very Captain Kirk of you.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.351
Hey, Callen.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.874
Did you get to
see your dad?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.223
No.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.442
DEEKS:
What about Alex?

13:54.485 --> 13:55.835
How is she holding up?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.795
Okay. How much of that
did you hear?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.406
Enough. Look, we're looking
at this all the wrong way.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.278
Every one of these scenarios,
we get what we want,

14:04.321 --> 14:05.496
the Russians don't.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.889
We need another scenario
where both sides

14:06.933 --> 14:08.499
walk away with something.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.024
It has to be something they want
even more than your father.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.460
Well, this is personal
for Volkoff.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.331
How on earth
do you compete with that?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.159
Anatoli Kirkin.

14:16.203 --> 14:19.423
What? It sounded like you
just said "Anatoli Kirkin."

14:19.467 --> 14:21.904
As in, the
Anatoli Kirkin

14:21.948 --> 14:23.384
that crushes on me hard
every time

14:23.427 --> 14:25.038
we cross paths.KENSI: Last time
that happened,

14:25.081 --> 14:26.430
he was on the run
for selling out

14:26.474 --> 14:27.867
his gang connections
back in Russia.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.043
Exactly. Those gangs are
practically one and the same

14:30.086 --> 14:32.784
with the Russian government,
as well as the FSB.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.004
If we can apprehend Kirkin,

14:35.048 --> 14:37.441
we can try and get the gangs
to pressure Volkoff

14:37.485 --> 14:39.269
to ask for Kirkin
instead of my father.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.489
Politically,
he'll have no choice.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.886
Sounds like a plan.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.452
Kirkin's been hiding
for two years.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.063
We'll have
to find him first.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.716
Um, I can put together a list

14:51.760 --> 14:53.501
of all the gangs
that want Kirkin dead.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.981
Maybe we can piggyback
off their efforts.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.504
Get your focus on the ones
that still may have

14:56.547 --> 14:57.592
a grudge against him.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.072
Copy that.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.509
Listen, Callen, not to play
the devil's advocate here,

15:01.552 --> 15:03.554
but I think this needs
to be said:

15:03.598 --> 15:06.993
even if we find Kirkin--
which is a big if unto itself--

15:07.036 --> 15:09.560
we're essentially handing him
over to be tortured and killed.

15:09.604 --> 15:13.477
What do you think Volkoff
is gonna do to my father?

15:13.521 --> 15:15.262
No, I-I get that...

15:15.305 --> 15:16.480
I'm not gonna
force you, Deeks.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.395
I'm not gonna force anyone.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.788
The only other option
is doing nothing,

15:19.831 --> 15:21.572
and that is not
an option for me.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.313
This isn't about
right and wrong.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.185
This is about his family.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.579
Don't have to ask me twice.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.755
Okay.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.975
Let's get to work.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.696
Ah.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.481
I haven't seen you all week.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.005
I was starting to think
we lost you again.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.096
Well, I needed a few days

16:07.140 --> 16:09.272
to settle my personal affairs.

16:09.316 --> 16:12.406
Ah, well, if you ever
need more time,

16:12.449 --> 16:16.018
please know that you
should feel free to take it.

16:16.062 --> 16:21.023
I realize I never thanked you

16:21.067 --> 16:25.114
for what you did during
the Vietnam operation.

16:25.158 --> 16:29.205
You didn't need to stick
your neck out for me,

16:29.249 --> 16:30.902
and I'm grateful.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.035
Well, I may not always agree
with you, Hetty,

16:33.079 --> 16:34.863
but you are NCIS.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.866
Unfortunately,

16:37.909 --> 16:42.697
SECNAV is reviewing your actions
during my rescue.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.047
Yes, I heard.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.049
I broke protocol,

16:47.093 --> 16:50.052
I failed
to secure authorization,

16:50.096 --> 16:52.968
and I'm sure
I violated several treaties.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.317
Not my finest hour.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.016
She and I are close.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.061
I could help.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.890
And in return,
should I look the other way

17:01.933 --> 17:03.979
while your team runs
behind my back,

17:04.023 --> 17:07.069
interfering
with an executive decision?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.419
Come on, Hetty.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.204
Stolen weapons from Pendleton?

17:11.247 --> 17:13.467
I expected so much more
from you.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.991
I suppose after three
months of living

17:16.035 --> 17:18.820
in a cage, I'm a bit rusty.

17:18.863 --> 17:21.562
But I'm curious.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.565
Why haven't you
shut them down?

17:24.608 --> 17:27.089
Maybe I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.004
So when I do shut them down,

17:29.048 --> 17:30.571
they stay down.

17:30.614 --> 17:33.400
If that's true,

17:33.443 --> 17:38.796
maybe you're more dangerous
than I anticipated.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.414
ERIC: Callen and Sam
are on their way.

17:47.457 --> 17:51.374
Great. So, question is,
which gang owns this barbershop?

17:51.418 --> 17:53.376
This is
the Grozny Mafia.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.725
They're Chechen arms dealers,

17:54.769 --> 17:58.120
but, in their spare time,
they... cut heroin.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.166
Ah.Get it? "Hair-oin."

18:00.209 --> 18:02.951
Yeah, no,
it's-it's really very clever.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.171
I'll be here all week.
Anyway, Kirkin's snitching

18:05.214 --> 18:06.955
basically decimated the gang.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.349
So this barbershop
is all they have left.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.612
Hmm. Speaking of old Kirkin,

18:11.655 --> 18:14.267
didn't he suffer
from some chronic back pain

18:14.310 --> 18:16.138
due to an old bullet wound?

18:16.182 --> 18:19.141
Yeah. That's why Deeks first met
him at that Russian bath.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.578
Yeah, and Anna kidnapped him
from the massage parlor.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
You know what I hate?

18:23.450 --> 18:24.625
Tell me.

18:24.668 --> 18:27.062
Finding a new doctor.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.150
Everyone hates that.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.804
Mm-hmm.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.763
According to the files from when
Kirkin was under house arrest,

18:32.807 --> 18:35.505
he was being treated
by his longtime doctor,

18:35.549 --> 18:38.029
Gerhard Sorensen.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.205
Ooh.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.816
It says here
Sorensen specializes

18:41.859 --> 18:44.210
in alternative stem cell
therapies.

18:44.253 --> 18:47.604
That is definitely not
FDA-approved.

18:47.648 --> 18:48.692
Hmm.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.172
Doesn't even have an office.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.695
House calls only.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.220
Exactly. So maybe Sorensen
is still making house calls

18:54.263 --> 18:55.830
to wherever Kirkin is.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.179
Okay, wait, wait.
This is assuming that Kirkin

18:57.223 --> 18:59.225
is in the same area,
which he probably isn't.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.617
I mean, this is a long shot.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.837
I mean, the whole plan
to save Callen's dad

19:02.880 --> 19:04.926
is pretty much
a long shot, so...Okay.

19:04.969 --> 19:08.016
I'll try to pull up
his GPS records,

19:08.059 --> 19:10.497
see if we can get something
to jump out.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.455
Ooh, Callen and
Sam just pulled up.

19:13.935 --> 19:17.286
Let's see if the Grozny Mafia
has any leads on Kirkin.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.505
Shall we?

19:18.548 --> 19:20.115
We shall.

19:26.774 --> 19:27.731
Come in.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.516
You Anzor Daudov?

19:30.343 --> 19:33.389
Who are you?

19:33.433 --> 19:36.262
Someone who has something
in common with you.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.264
A former associate.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.570
Anatoli Kirkin.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.841
You could use a shave,
my friend.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.147
Sit down.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.193
We will talk.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.722
I can do nothing for you.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.597
You done with that?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.169
Thank you.

20:15.475 --> 20:18.129
So, Mr. Kirkin.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.131
Friend of yours?

20:20.175 --> 20:22.264
Was.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.614
My colleague and I

20:24.658 --> 20:27.443
moved some money for him
through our accounting firm.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.185
Then one crisp October day
about two years ago,

20:30.229 --> 20:31.230
the feds showed up.

20:31.273 --> 20:35.408
I spent the next
18 months in prison.

20:38.672 --> 20:42.284
You would not be alone
in your grievance, my friend.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.852
But, uh, why are you
telling me this?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.289
Because he did
the same thing to you.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.248
And from what I hear,

20:49.291 --> 20:52.251
you are not a man
who forgives his enemies.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.253
Neither am I.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.865
You've been told wrong,
my friend.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.389
Kirkin is gone.

21:03.305 --> 21:07.483
So, if you, uh, cannot forgive,

21:07.527 --> 21:10.617
I would suggest that you forget.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.143
I can't.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.928
Kirkin may have stolen
my freedom,

21:17.972 --> 21:20.757
but fortunately, the feds
did not take all of my money.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.374
I'd say that this shop
could use a little upkeep.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.941
Maybe hire
a few more employees.

21:30.985 --> 21:34.467
Maybe... restock the armory.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.299
Follow me.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.040
Your colleague stays here.

21:53.442 --> 21:57.272
We grabbed him last month, one
of Kirkin's .

21:57.316 --> 21:59.883
But he won't talk.

21:59.927 --> 22:02.146
And believe me,
we've tried.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.416
Whoop, there it is.

22:10.459 --> 22:13.114
Dr. Sorensen started
travelling to a new

22:13.157 --> 22:14.463
residential address
just two months after

22:14.507 --> 22:16.335
Kirkin went into hiding.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.685
That's almost three times as far
as his other patients.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.121
That's worth a shot.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.601
All right, I'll tell
Kensi and Deeks.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.690

22:23.733 --> 22:25.256

Ah, crikey.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.873
Harley. Uh, Agent Hidoko.Look, we can explain.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.789
Don't bother.
I can't believe you two.

22:35.832 --> 22:38.095
After everything
we've been through,

22:38.139 --> 22:39.793
you still don't trust me enough
to ask for help?

22:39.836 --> 22:43.057
So you're not going
to drag us back

22:43.100 --> 22:44.667
to Mosley's
office right now?

22:44.711 --> 22:46.147
She doesn't know I'm here.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.105
Let's keep it that way.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.324
How can I help?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.458

where Kirkin is?

22:54.982 --> 22:57.245
I believe so.

he's an abomination.

Where is Kirkin?

Uh...

23:18.092 --> 23:20.050
Look at me.
Where is Anatoli?

23:25.534 --> 23:27.057
Eric, Nell, you there?

23:27.101 --> 23:29.451
Yeah. Callen, we read you.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.931
We got a problem.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.760
Grozny Mafia's kidnapped one of
Kirkin's ex-boyfriends.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.414
He may know where Kirkin is,

23:35.457 --> 23:36.937
but we're gonna have to
break him out of here.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.288
Taken care of Anzor.

Save your breath, Mosley.
You were right.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.062
You want me to clear out
my desk, just say the word.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.585
I'm not sure I follow.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.066
According to Agent Hanna,
you have a promising lead

32:18.110 --> 32:20.068
on the weapons
stolen in Pendleton.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.029
Or I don't know.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.465
Maybe there
is a reason why

32:25.508 --> 32:28.250
I should be asking you
to clean out your desk.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.345
She bought the Pendleton story?

32:36.389 --> 32:38.478
SAM:
Hell no.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.393
Not for a second.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.656
But she played along
as if she did.

32:42.699 --> 32:46.877
Even handled the LAPD
at the barbershop.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.228
I don't understand.

32:49.271 --> 32:52.405
What did you say to stop her
from shutting us down?

32:54.885 --> 32:58.019
Maybe I'm just waiting
for the right moment,

32:58.063 --> 33:01.414
so when I do shut them down,
they stay down.

33:01.457 --> 33:04.243
If that's true...

33:04.286 --> 33:08.290
maybe you're more dangerous
than I anticipated.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.730
But I don't
think it is.

33:13.774 --> 33:18.387
I think you empathize

33:18.431 --> 33:21.695
with Mr. Callen's situation.

33:21.738 --> 33:26.091
And knowing what
happened to your son,

33:26.134 --> 33:29.007
I can understand
completely.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.139
Reading my file

33:31.183 --> 33:34.142
and knowing my motives
are not the same.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.550
You do what you have to do,
Assistant Director,

33:50.593 --> 33:54.380
and my people will do
what they need to do.

33:59.689 --> 34:02.605
The offer to
help with SECNAV

34:02.649 --> 34:04.651
still stands.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.265
You know where to find me.

34:15.270 --> 34:18.926
I didn't have to say anything.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.407
It was her choice.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.497
She understands what you're
going through, Mr. Callen,

34:24.540 --> 34:26.412
more than you know.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.153
To that end,

34:28.196 --> 34:32.331
she was able to call in a few
favors at the State Department.

34:32.374 --> 34:35.595
She got you access
to see your father.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.087
I didn't have
to choose you.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.653
You do know that?

34:50.697 --> 34:52.438
Ma'am?

34:52.481 --> 34:54.440
For this assignment.

34:54.483 --> 34:57.356
There were other candidates
more qualified,

34:57.399 --> 35:01.447
more experienced,
but I took a chance on you.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.801
And I'm grateful.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.543
But it wasn't right what they
were doing to Callen's father.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.458
I couldn't just stand by and...I don't think

35:12.501 --> 35:14.329
I asked you to.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.812
Next time,
you come and talk to me,

35:18.855 --> 35:21.597
but don't ever go
behind my back again.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.395
Can you give us
a moment alone?

35:37.526 --> 35:39.528
We'll be watching.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.492
Don't speak.

35:46.535 --> 35:50.191
And don't move.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.237
All right.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.590
Chatty family.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.293
We don't have a lot of time.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.903
Grisha, what are you doing?

36:06.947 --> 36:08.644
I activated a playback loop
so they won't see you escape.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.342
Escape? Grisha...Don't worry.
I'm going with you.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.647
You'll never get out
of the country without me.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.171
They'll hunt you down.I don't care.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.433
I'm not letting them
take you like this.

36:14.476 --> 36:15.912
It's not your
decision to make.

36:20.569 --> 36:23.050
The hell it isn't.
Get in the water.

36:23.093 --> 36:24.834
No.
Damn it, Dad!

36:24.878 --> 36:28.273
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

36:29.926 --> 36:32.233
I will not let you
sacrifice yourself for me.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.583
I chose this life long ago.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.978
If I can save another family,
then it is a good trade.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.723
The right trade.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.472
Oh, geez.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.256
Aah. What are you doing?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.997
Monty slept
on your pillow again.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.651
Monty, we talked
about this.

36:58.694 --> 36:59.956
Hey, don't blame him.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.697
Maybe if you tried washing
your hair more often?

37:01.741 --> 37:03.569
What, with your shampoo
with all the chemicals in it,

37:03.612 --> 37:05.440
and lose my natural oils?Don't be jealous.

37:05.484 --> 37:06.702

37:06.746 --> 37:08.313
are what keeps my hair
vibrant and strong.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.010
Too much shampoo,
too many chemicals--

37:10.053 --> 37:12.186
that was Uncle Grandpappy
Cliff's downfall.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.448
Mm.

How are you still alive?

37:18.888 --> 37:21.935

37:21.978 --> 37:26.592
I, uh, have been siphoning money
from Dan's inheritance.

37:26.635 --> 37:30.204

freedom from the gang?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.989
