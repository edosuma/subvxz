WEBVTT

00:54.221 --> 00:57.641
Okay, we are almost out of time,
and we got one more question.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.769
What are three things
that contributed to the success

01:00.853 --> 01:02.938
of the Lewis and Clark Expedition?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.438
Three things. Who's got one?

01:04.522 --> 01:06.149
-Mandy. Always on it.
-Sacagawea.

01:06.233 --> 01:10.445
Sacagawea, their female guide
of the Shoshone tribe. Very good.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.613
Who else has one?

01:11.697 --> 01:13.323
Why you gotta say
she's their female guide?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.741
Why can't she just be their guide?

01:16.785 --> 01:20.372
Well, I think it's relevant
that she was female.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.543
In Lewis and Clark's time,
you know, early 1800s,

01:24.626 --> 01:27.421
it was rare for a female like Sacagawea…

01:28.922 --> 01:31.592
to be empowered
with any kind of leadership role.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.802
It's rare today too.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.307
That's a great point.
It is still way too rare.

01:38.849 --> 01:44.605
All I'm saying is 200 years ago,
it was definitely a lot worse.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.775
Which I think is worth acknowledging.

01:52.821 --> 01:53.822
True.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.992
Cool. Who else has one?

01:57.743 --> 01:58.994
I'm gonna pick a name.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.246
-Paul.
-Huh?

02:02.039 --> 02:03.624
-Lewis and Clark.
-Yeah?

02:03.707 --> 02:06.168
Looking for something else
that contributed to their success.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.169
I don't know.
They probably just got lucky.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.547
Okay, no, that's a good answer.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.091
-You think they just got lucky?
-I mean, probably.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.636
Do you think that a lot of success
comes down to luck?

02:15.719 --> 02:16.929
Definitely.

02:17.012 --> 02:20.599
Interesting.
Okay, who agrees with Paul about this?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.684
Anybody? Anybody disagree?

02:23.477 --> 02:24.978
Nice. Ramon, what do you think?

02:25.062 --> 02:28.357
No. Like, if you're successful,
that's because you've worked for it.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.567
You could be like, "I got bad luck."

02:30.651 --> 02:34.029
But when somebody says they got bad luck,
they did something, you know?

02:34.112 --> 02:36.448
They lied. They stole something.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.326
They're dipping their genitals
into somewhere they shouldn't be dipping--

02:39.409 --> 02:40.410
-Okay.
-I'm serious though.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.870
I know, and that's a good argument.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.915
But I'm curious
how everyone feels about this.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.126
Who here thinks they're lucky?

02:48.836 --> 02:52.172
I want everyone to answer this question.
I'll give you a second to think about it.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.217
Now raise your hand
if you think you're a lucky person.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.972
Just Ramon? Okay, raise your hand
if you think you're unlucky.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.142
Got it. Okay, you can put your hands down.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.353
-What about you, Mr. Corman?
-What's that?

03:06.436 --> 03:08.230
You didn't raise your hand.

03:08.313 --> 03:12.860
Me? No, I--
I mean, I feel like a lucky person.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.486
For sure.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.575
You know what?
That's time, so let's pack up.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.787
And congratulations on finishing
your first week of fifth grade.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.455
That's no small feat.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.249
Everybody, have a great weekend.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.626
And I'll see ya Monday.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.136
Seriously, you know my life.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.680
Things like this
don't usually happen for me.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.849
Yeah, he just DMed me,
like, out of nowhere.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.186
And now we're going to this thing tonight.
It's at Knott's Berry Farm.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.521
I know. So blessed right now.

03:49.605 --> 03:50.606
That all?

05:29.705 --> 05:33.041
Being the best is not a game of chance.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.838
It's the right choice,
right now, every time.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.673
Yo, you want some spaghetti?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.887
-Do we have sauce?
-We have salt. We have some oil.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.471
Yeah. I'm good.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.308
Are you really not gonna eat
just 'cause we don't have sauce?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.768
The one and only Cadillac Escalade.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.853
You're right.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.067
-This is actually delicious.
-So what do you wanna do tonight?

06:00.944 --> 06:01.945
What?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.406
My bad. Did something happen?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.992
-What do you mean?
-Did Megan start seeing someone?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.702
I have no idea. Why would you ask me that?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.246
'Cause you're acting weird like,
"What do you wanna do tonight?"

06:11.330 --> 06:12.664
-That's not weird.
-It is weird.

06:12.748 --> 06:15.876
It's not weird to ask someone what
they feel like doing on a Friday night.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.879
It is for you. That's why I'm asking.
Are you okay?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.672
I'm fine. I--

06:21.548 --> 06:23.217
-There's--
-What?

06:23.300 --> 06:24.927
There was this woman at the store.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.971
She was, like, talking on her phone
about going to Knott's Berry Farm.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.724
-And, I don't know. I was--
-So… what?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.227
-So you wanna go to Knott's?
-No, I don't wanna go to Knott's.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.520
-I'm saying--
-Okay, so?

06:34.603 --> 06:37.940
It's just, she seemed excited
about her life. It was sweet.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.775
-You're sweet.
-That's great.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.610
-I believe you.
-Thank you so much.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.488
I just-- I need to do something tonight.
Can we please do that?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.406
You know,
why don't you just play some music?

06:47.199 --> 06:48.575
-No.
-No? Okay.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.910
How about some Mario Kart?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.288
-Dude. No. I'm saying that--
-Well, then what do you wanna do then?

06:53.372 --> 06:55.958
-Well, I'm asking you.
-All right.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.588
-This is hard.
-I know.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.132
-It feels like it shouldn't be this hard.
-I know.

07:04.216 --> 07:07.135
Okay, we gotta-- We can figure this out.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.306
We could go out and find some girls?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.767
-"Find some girls?"
-Yeah.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.144
-Like find your keys?
-Come on. Don't start--

07:16.228 --> 07:18.522
-Like find an animal to go hunt and kill?
-Who said animal?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.148
-Who said killing animals?
-To eat her?

07:20.232 --> 07:22.317
You were the one that said
there was a girl in a store.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.402
-Something about--
-A woman.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.404
-I didn't say a girl. I said a woman.
-Oh, my God.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.614
Who do you think you're talking to?
I respect women--

07:27.698 --> 07:29.199
You know what, this isn't about girls.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.660
-All right, we could do-- Women.
-Women.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.037
We could do anything at all tonight.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.163
-Right.
-Right?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.833
Remember before we could drive?
We used to talk all this shit

07:37.916 --> 07:40.836
about everything we were gonna do
once we could do anything we wanted to.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.630
So, like, if we were 15 again,
what would we do?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.801
-Go to a bar and talk to girls.
-It's true.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.511
-Fuck.
-Right? Come on.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.722
What, you don't wanna go to a bar?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.765
No. You know what? We should go. Let's go.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.684
-We don't have to go to a bar.
-I'm just saying,

07:55.767 --> 07:58.353
like, even if we did go to a bar
and talked to some girls,

07:58.437 --> 08:00.772
it's not like they'd have
anything interesting to say.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.983
-Why wouldn't they?
-'Cause they're girls at a bar.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.902
That is incredibly sexist.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.778
-I didn't mean it like that.
-You are horrible.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.281
Not because they're girls.
It's because they're people.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.618
I'm saying most people
don't have anything interesting to say,

08:12.701 --> 08:13.911
especially at bars.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.997
-Wait, didn't you meet Megan in a bar?
-That's different.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.874
We had a friend that introduced us.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.292
-It's different.
-Okay.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.085
But you were physically inside a bar, man.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.713
The point I'm making is,
why would I go talk to somebody

08:24.796 --> 08:27.132
if they're not gonna have
anything interesting to say?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.760
Like, what am I really doing?
Just trying to have sex with a girl?

08:29.843 --> 08:33.138
That's not all you're trying to do.
Why do I feel it's a bad thing to say yes?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.682
Yes, sex is great.
If they want to, why not?

08:35.765 --> 08:38.434
Yeah, but even if they want to,
I'm saying I won't be able to enjoy it

08:38.519 --> 08:40.187
because I'll just be thinking
the whole time

08:40.270 --> 08:42.272
about all the things she said
back at the bar

08:42.356 --> 08:43.899
that were not interesting at all,

08:43.982 --> 08:47.444
but I acted like they were interesting,
and I smiled like a phony fuck,

08:47.528 --> 08:49.821
and I'd just be hating myself
the whole time.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.158
Okay. So we shouldn't go to a bar.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.327
-Maybe we should though. Well, you--
-Dude, what?

08:55.410 --> 08:58.163
-We said we were gonna try something new.
-I didn't say that.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.874
-I've never said that.
-Well, we can't just sit here. Okay.

09:00.958 --> 09:05.462
It can't be just either we go to a bar
or we stay here and play video games.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.464
There has to be more than two choices.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.426
Dude, listen to yourself.

09:11.510 --> 09:15.055
-You can't be serious. No, you're not.
-I'm pretty sure that I am.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.015
-How much do you make in a year?
-I have no idea.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.100
-What?
-Horseshit.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.935
-Why would I know that?
-Do you not pay taxes?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.353
-Is that not a thing you do?
-I do.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.063
I just don't keep track
of that information

09:23.146 --> 09:24.481
throughout the course of the year.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.067
-Doesn't your dad do your taxes?
-Exactly. Yes, he does.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.151
Okay, fine.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.903
So even if you don't know
how much you make,

09:29.987 --> 09:31.822
that doesn't mean
you're below the poverty line.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.448
-I'm pretty sure that I am.
-Okay, wait.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.576
We can go here.
Rendition Room, it's called.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.202
-I'm down.
-It's thirteen minutes away.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.912
I can drive, but we have to take two cars.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.414
-Yeah, I can drive.
-You just smoked.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.041
-But I haven't had anything to drink.
-Sure you can afford the gas?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.459
Okay. We can all fit in my car.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.461
Do you really not know
what your annual income is?

09:46.545 --> 09:47.546
-Wait. Hold on.
-No, Victor,

09:47.629 --> 09:50.007
not all of us are spending
the majority of our waking lives

09:50.090 --> 09:52.593
-climbing the corporate ladder like you.
-Don't talk shit about UPS

09:52.676 --> 09:54.219
-'cause you're jealous.
-I'm not talking shit.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.264
I'm saying it is a corporation
and you're literally climbing its ladder…

09:57.347 --> 09:58.974
-It's a great company.
-…on a regular basis.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.727
-I'm not gonna apologize for it.
-I'm not saying you should apologize.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.604
It's a good company
'cause it's a fair company.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.565
-Dude. Can we please just--
-I tell this to my drivers all the time.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.817
You treat UPS well,
UPS treats you well, right?

10:08.901 --> 10:10.694
And I treat UPS well. Perfect. Bam.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.489
Right? You think I got to where I am
in the corporation overnight?

10:14.573 --> 10:16.450
-You said "corporation."
-I just walked in there,

10:16.533 --> 10:19.328
and they were like, "Ay, yo.
You're an on-rate Supervisor?" Fuck no.

10:19.411 --> 10:23.081
-Yo, where you going?
-I'm going out… into the world.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.718
-You okay?
-Yeah.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.803
-Drunk as a box of birds.
-What?

10:36.887 --> 10:39.598
-Nothing. The door is locked.
-No, it's not.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.350
Holy Jesus. Why can't I--

10:42.976 --> 10:44.186
Thank you.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.860
So, how's your night?

10:51.944 --> 10:54.404
Ridiculous.
My friends are all dysfunctional people.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.992
-How are you?
-I am good.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.953
-What was that?
-What?

11:01.036 --> 11:04.039
-Obviously, something's bothering you.
-Nothing's bothering me.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.291
Okay.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.128
I wanted to ask you though.
Do you know who Sacagawea is?

11:10.212 --> 11:11.255
Sure.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.300
Do you think it's wrong for me to call her
Lewis and Clark's female guide?

11:15.384 --> 11:18.470
-What do you mean?
-Instead of just calling her their guide.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.558
Darling. Don't do that to yourself.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.393
Not doing anything to myself.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.602
You are a good man.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.647
Well, thank you.
I appreciate your non-biased opinion.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.857
And you're doing good work

11:29.940 --> 11:32.985
teaching young people
that need to be taught things.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.821
They're lucky to have you.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.365
Back when I was in school,
it was a complete waste of time.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.201
Most of my students
would probably say the same thing.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.787
Fine. You wanna be useless.
You're useless.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.582
At least you have a job.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.084
Which is more than Lisa can say
about her son.

11:49.835 --> 11:53.046
Everybody's so proud of you, you know,
when I get together with them

11:53.130 --> 11:55.465
and they ask what you're doing,
and I tell them.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.593
They're just all so proud.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.553
Not like when you were
in the music business.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.889
-Then they were concerned.
-I wasn't in the music business.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.892
Exactly.
You have to make money to be in business.

12:04.975 --> 12:08.061
I mean, don't get me wrong,
you know I love music.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.399
And that's what's important, you know?
That you love it.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.318
You play. You love it.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.904
-That's what matters.
-Yeah, but I don't play.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.948
No, I don't mean shows.
I mean for yourself.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.742
Yeah, I don't do that.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.036
I haven't played anything at all
in, like, a year.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.332
Well, you didn't tell me that.

12:29.958 --> 12:30.959
Yeah.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.464
Well, fuck it. One less thing, right?

12:36.632 --> 12:39.092
In the end,
all that matters is family, so…

12:39.176 --> 12:42.012
-That's all that matters? It's depressing.
-No, it's not.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.681
So you're saying, what,
the only thing that matters

12:44.765 --> 12:47.518
in my entire life is just you and Beth,
and that's it?

12:47.601 --> 12:50.437
No, of course I didn't mean that,
obviously.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.356
I meant that someday

12:52.439 --> 12:55.108
maybe you'll start a family
and then you'll know what I mean.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.610
I might not start a family.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.695
-I said maybe.
-And even if I did start a family,

12:58.779 --> 13:00.280
I might not know what you mean.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.406
You will.

13:04.660 --> 13:08.956
Shouldn't all that matters be
the moment we're living in right now?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.291
No.

13:15.963 --> 13:16.964
Okay.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.132
All right.

13:21.510 --> 13:22.719
You're wonderful.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.805
No.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.973
Thank you.

13:27.558 --> 13:28.559
Okay, fine.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.978
-Thanks.
-Yeah. No worries.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.184
Yo, there you are.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.268
-Ay.
-Yo.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.437
-How long you been here?
-Not too long.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.563
Shit. I'm sorry man.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.690
-I didn't see you. Where were you?
-Right here.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.317
-Yeah, my bad.
-All good.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.902
How you been?

15:01.985 --> 15:03.403
Yeah, man. Good, good.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.572
Dope. You been playing anywhere lately or…

15:07.658 --> 15:08.867
No, I stopped.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.912
-You stopped?
-Yeah.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.872
Just playing for myself now.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.625
-Come on, man. You can't give up.
-Yeah.

15:18.544 --> 15:19.753
How about you?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.798
Shit, man. Me?
I just been staying relentless, you know?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.175
Step by step,
getting the ball down the field.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.135
I've been playing
a lot of great music lately,

15:27.219 --> 15:29.179
but honestly, nowadays in this industry

15:29.263 --> 15:31.390
it's about having
a lot of different irons in the fire.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.809
Placing multiple bets,
getting it however the fuck you can,

15:33.892 --> 15:36.186
because the demand for content
nowadays is insane.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.397
So I started doing some hosting, you know?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.149
A little bit of acting,
some scripted, some unscripted,

15:41.233 --> 15:43.360
working behind the camera, but…

15:43.443 --> 15:46.405
I got verified a couple months ago,
so I must be doing something right.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.866
That's great.

15:48.949 --> 15:52.411
Yeah. Yeah, man. Things are pretty good.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
-Yeah.
-Happy to hear it.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.082
Yeah.

16:29.281 --> 16:32.367
Yo! For sure. Bro!

17:09.320 --> 17:10.321
No, thanks.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.825
What do you mean "No, thanks"?
I just asked you to come outside to smoke.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.493
Is that why you asked me to come outside?

17:16.078 --> 17:18.038
-Very confident.
-Did that work?

17:18.121 --> 17:19.748
-Totally, but--
-Really?

17:19.830 --> 17:22.041
-But you're not drinking either.
-How'd you know?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.419
'Cause you were holding
a glass of club soda when I met you.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.380
That could've been vodka.
There was a lime in it.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.049
No, I can tell you're not drinking.
Don't worry. I like it.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.300
Thanks.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.385
Unless…

17:32.803 --> 17:34.805
You're not, like,
Mormon or something, are you?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.181
I'm actually Muslim.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.475
Really? That's really great.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.228
Sorry. Yeah, that was-- I was joking.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.189
That's not really that funny.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.818
I just meant, you know,
'cause Muslims don't drink.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.862
How would you know that
if you're not Muslim?

17:50.362 --> 17:52.281
I'm pretty sure it's part of the religion.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.285
Well, thanks for explaining that.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.163
Maybe I should have a cigarette.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.082
You should have a drink
is what you should have.

18:02.165 --> 18:05.919
No, I really do not drink.
But one smoke's okay. Right?

18:06.461 --> 18:08.005
Okay.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.464
As you wish.

18:10.549 --> 18:12.342
Is that a Princess Bride reference?

18:12.426 --> 18:14.970
Yes. Okay. Oh, my God. I like you again.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.805
Nice.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.353
So, where are you from?

18:23.437 --> 18:24.438
Here.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.981
No, like where were you born?

18:26.064 --> 18:27.441
I was born and raised here.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.610
Wait, what? You're from LA?

18:29.693 --> 18:32.779
-No. Literally no one is from LA.
-I've heard that.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.574
What, is your family,
like, in the business?

18:35.657 --> 18:37.618
-You mean plastics?
-What?

18:38.952 --> 18:40.704
Yeah. No, it's…

18:40.787 --> 18:44.625
My mom's in real estate
and her dad was a plumber,

18:44.708 --> 18:46.126
and they're both from LA.

18:46.210 --> 18:49.796
Hold on. Your mom
and her dad were both born in LA?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.924
That's completely insane.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.759
My mind is blown.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.719
Where are you from?

18:56.261 --> 18:57.971
I'm from Waltham, Massachusetts.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.557
You've never heard of it.
It's a suburb of Boston.

19:00.641 --> 19:04.102
But I seriously know more people
from Waltham that live in LA right now

19:04.186 --> 19:06.188
than people from Waltham
who still live in Waltham.

19:06.271 --> 19:08.774
It's like everybody moved out here.
It's crazy.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.609
Well, LA is a great town.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.736
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.364
Maybe you just need to meet more people
that aren't from Waltham.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.615
Yeah, maybe so.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.493
You gonna introduce me
to some real Angelenos?

19:19.576 --> 19:20.744
I know a bunch.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.540
So what do you do?

19:25.541 --> 19:27.417
I teach fifth grade.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.503
Shut up, I love you.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.548
Tell me everything.
I wanna know all about it.

19:33.924 --> 19:37.511
I don't know, fifth grade is…

19:37.594 --> 19:42.015
You know, it's ten and 11-year-olds.
So they're basically grown-ups.

19:42.099 --> 19:45.602
I mean, they're not,
but they're not that different.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.647
Or maybe it's that, you know,

19:48.730 --> 19:51.900
most grown-ups aren't that different
from ten and 11-year-olds.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.820
That's amazing.

19:55.529 --> 19:56.864
You know, it's…

19:56.947 --> 20:00.534
I mean, those kids,
they're like the future, right?

20:02.202 --> 20:03.745
They are a part of it.

20:03.829 --> 20:04.830
Yeah.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.666
I mean,
I think what you're doing is fantastic.

20:07.749 --> 20:08.834
Thanks.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.091
Listen, would you wanna--

20:18.719 --> 20:19.720
Yeah.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.599
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.685
-All right. Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah.

20:27.728 --> 20:28.729
Great.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.867
Hi, baby. Hi.

20:42.451 --> 20:45.787
Come here, buddy. I missed you.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.540
This is Liam.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.751
Say, "Hi, Liam."

20:51.585 --> 20:53.212
-Say hi.
-Hi, Liam.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.050
Okay, you're gonna come in here
and go to your bed.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.136
And I'll see you in a bit.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.723
It's really a lovely place.

21:04.806 --> 21:05.807
Thank you.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.119
Music?

22:01.196 --> 22:02.197
Here, I'll do it.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.105
I want you.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.650
-Okay, I wanna get a condom.
-Okay.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.320
Take your pants off.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.697
Hi, baby. Good boy.

23:12.476 --> 23:13.685
Did you put it on?

23:17.105 --> 23:18.106
Did you?

23:19.358 --> 23:20.359
Not yet.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.615
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

23:28.325 --> 23:29.993
-Are you--
-It's fine. It's fine.

23:32.996 --> 23:36.667
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.253
-This has never happened to me before.
-Sorry.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.213
What's wrong with you?

23:43.382 --> 23:45.008
-I don't know.
-Are you--

23:45.634 --> 23:47.594
Is this, like, normal for you?

23:48.303 --> 23:51.265
-Not really.
-Not really? So it is?

23:53.183 --> 23:54.768
-Maybe I should go.
-No, no, no, no.

23:54.852 --> 23:57.104
I wanna know
how often does this happen to you.

23:57.187 --> 24:00.190
-I don't do this kind of thing that often.
-What kind of thing?

24:00.691 --> 24:03.443
-Have sex with a woman that I just--
-We're not having any sex.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.488
Okay, attempt to have sex
with a woman I just met.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.700
-Then why'd you come home with me?
-I don't know.

24:11.368 --> 24:12.369
I--

24:13.871 --> 24:15.873
I thought I'd, like, try something new.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.000
That's not an answer.

24:18.917 --> 24:22.254
Look, I'm sorry. I'm really,
really sorry for everything. I can go.

24:23.964 --> 24:26.216
I'd rather you just be honest with me.

24:27.217 --> 24:28.218
Honestly,

24:28.969 --> 24:30.053
I don't know.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.764
I don't know why my dick
decided to stop working

24:32.848 --> 24:35.559
when you wanted to have sex.
You're an attractive woman.

24:36.852 --> 24:40.230
If I'm being really honest, I'm probably
gonna think about this some other time

24:40.314 --> 24:42.649
and fantasize about
what it would've been like

24:42.733 --> 24:46.320
if it had gone the way
that it's supposed to, but…

24:49.281 --> 24:51.742
In real life, things don't go
the way they're supposed to.

24:51.825 --> 24:54.536
At least they don't for me. So…

24:55.287 --> 24:58.832
Look, it's not a big deal.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.877
Right? It happens to a lot of guys.

25:02.878 --> 25:06.423
And we don't have to have sex
the first night we meet, you know?

25:06.507 --> 25:09.510
It's actually--
It's actually really sweet.

25:11.512 --> 25:12.513
Right?

25:13.347 --> 25:15.682
Wanna just hang out?

25:16.934 --> 25:20.229
-No, I think I should just really go--
-You don't have to be embarrassed at all.

25:20.312 --> 25:23.190
-I know. Thank you, but no, I--
-Just-- No, come here. Come sit down.

25:24.608 --> 25:25.734
I'm gonna go.

25:26.902 --> 25:29.321
It's my fault. I made a mistake.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.991
So basically, if we're not fucking

25:33.075 --> 25:35.077
there's no point in hanging out with me,
right?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.329
-I didn't say that.
-Then what are you saying?

25:40.374 --> 25:41.375
I just have to go.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.836
'Cause I think what you're saying
is you like being a loser.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.636
You know what, and by the way,
your breath is terrible.

25:56.849 --> 25:59.017
It's 'cause I smoked
one of your cigarettes.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.187
How do you think your breath is?
It's no fucking wonder I didn't stay hard.

26:02.271 --> 26:04.648
Every time we kissed, I thought
I was gonna throw up in your mouth.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.484
No, I bet I know why
you were impotent tonight.

26:07.568 --> 26:09.403
-Because I make more money than you.
-That's it.

26:09.486 --> 26:12.406
We came here in your piece of shit car
with your busted fender

26:12.489 --> 26:14.533
-that you can't afford to fix.
-That happened today.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.369
We had to come back to my apartment
because you live in some shit place.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.621
-We came back for Liam.
-You can barely support yourself.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.540
You wouldn't be able to support me
and a family.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.418
-Now we're having a family?
-By the way, you know what,

26:24.501 --> 26:27.171
your whole teacher thing
about how much you love kids?

26:27.254 --> 26:28.547
I call bullshit.

26:29.089 --> 26:33.177
The only people who become teachers
are people who wanted to do something else

26:33.260 --> 26:34.428
and gave up.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.730
Can I ask you something?

26:48.650 --> 26:49.651
What?

26:53.530 --> 26:54.656
When you were younger…

26:55.407 --> 26:58.160
like not a young girl,
but just a younger woman,

27:00.370 --> 27:04.458
did you always know
you were gonna die alone?

28:39.303 --> 28:40.470
Hola, Josh.

28:40.971 --> 28:43.849
Hey, Beatriz. Buenos días!

28:43.932 --> 28:47.060
Buenos días! How's it going?

28:47.144 --> 28:48.145
All right.

28:49.521 --> 28:52.608
-How was your weekend?
-I can't complain, you know.

28:52.691 --> 28:54.735
We're broke, but other than that,

28:54.818 --> 28:57.613
grandbabies can feed themselves now,
so I get to sleep in.

28:57.696 --> 28:59.323
-Nice.
-How about you?

29:01.950 --> 29:02.951
Yeah.

29:03.035 --> 29:04.620
-That good, huh?
-No. It was all right.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.371
Everything is good.

29:08.332 --> 29:10.959
-It is.
-Yes, it is.

29:12.294 --> 29:14.254
-Have a good one.
-All right, you too.

29:32.481 --> 29:35.150
All right, good morning. Happy Monday.
How was everyone's weekend?

29:42.741 --> 29:44.535
-Hi.
-Hey, you okay?

29:45.786 --> 29:47.996
Yeah. Yeah, just putting out fires.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.500
-If you're busy, don't worry about it.
-No, I'm busy but it's fine.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.877
Tell me. What's wrong?

29:54.545 --> 29:56.505
Nothing. Everything is good.

29:56.588 --> 29:57.589
I'm…

29:58.549 --> 30:00.968
I have it really good. I just… You know.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.055
Know what? It's what?

30:05.138 --> 30:08.433
It just--
It doesn't always feel that way, I guess.

30:09.434 --> 30:13.397
Well, I mean… whose fault is that?

30:14.314 --> 30:17.401
-Thanks, Mom.
-I'm just saying.

30:17.484 --> 30:18.819
You know what? Never mind.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.362
No. Okay.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.533
How was the rest of your weekend?

30:24.616 --> 30:27.035
It was great. I met a woman, you know.

30:27.119 --> 30:30.581
She seemed to really like me,
but I couldn't maintain an erection, so…

30:30.664 --> 30:32.374
-I'm hanging up now.
-Okay.
