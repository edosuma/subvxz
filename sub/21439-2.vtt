* When you get damned
in the popular opinion *

20:11.611 --> 20:13.980
[ Beeps ]
* It's just another damn
of the damns you're not giving *

20:14.013 --> 20:15.582
* And I

20:15.615 --> 20:17.784
* I'm getting ready
to get down *

20:17.817 --> 20:19.919
* Getting ready to get down

20:19.952 --> 20:22.555
* Getting ready to get down

20:22.589 --> 20:24.524
Man:
Let me do the talking.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.394
[ Radio chatter ]

20:27.427 --> 20:28.495
In a hurry?

20:28.528 --> 20:29.896
Sorry, officer.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.365
Um, normally,
I would be the one driving,

20:32.399 --> 20:35.902
but we stopped for lunch,
and my boss back there

20:35.935 --> 20:37.737
pressured me into having
a couple of beers.

20:37.770 --> 20:41.341
Anyway,
just to be extra careful,

20:41.374 --> 20:42.875
I let ol' lead foot here

20:42.909 --> 20:47.747
drive us up the rest of the way
to, uh, Froggy Cottage.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.650
So, maybe you could
let us off with a warning?

20:50.683 --> 20:53.486
I guess that sounds fair.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.855
So your boss --
was he drinking as well?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.624
Which boss?

20:59.058 --> 21:02.061
Sir, will you step out
of the car, please?
