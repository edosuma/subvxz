00:02.503 --> 00:03.418
<i>Previously on</i> KC Undercover...

00:03.453 --> 00:04.711
I saw my cousin Abby.

00:04.746 --> 00:06.504
Floatin' on the Potomac?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.648
She saw you?

00:08.683 --> 00:10.725
This is why I don't
tell you anything.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.746
KC cannot get in
the way of this mission.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.174
If she does,
I have to eliminate her.

00:15.198 --> 00:16.781
All right, pack your gear.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.524
We're heading to Bung Hill.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.310
We're headed to Bung Hill.

00:20.345 --> 00:22.162
And if anybody gets in our way...

00:22.197 --> 00:24.014
They're going to be sorry
they got in our way.

00:44.302 --> 00:46.570
Oh, goody. You're alive.

00:46.605 --> 00:48.438
They got our girl.

00:48.474 --> 00:49.589
They got our girl.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.232
Don't worry.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.068
We'll get her back.

00:53.103 --> 00:54.061
They're not getting
away with this.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.296
At least, not alive.

01:02.121 --> 01:05.255
All right, Abby, if you ever
wanna see the sunlight again,

01:05.290 --> 01:07.536
I suggest you start talking and
tell us where your parents are.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.100
Say something!

01:09.136 --> 01:13.162
Fine. I never liked you,

01:13.198 --> 01:14.823
and I'm much prettier
than you are.

01:14.858 --> 01:17.058
Want me to say anything else?

01:17.094 --> 01:19.205
Yeah, I suggest you start
with the words, "Get off me."

01:19.229 --> 01:21.246
Huh?

01:21.282 --> 01:23.089
Get off me!

01:23.125 --> 01:25.642
No, KC. Enough violence.
Calm down, KC.

01:25.677 --> 01:29.070
Tell me where your parents are
or you're gonna be sorry!

01:29.105 --> 01:30.730
Okay, all right.

01:30.766 --> 01:32.975
Thanks.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.210
Abby, listen to me.

01:35.245 --> 01:38.146
Okay, at the end of the day,
I'm still your auntie.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.398
Honey, just tell us
where they are,

01:40.434 --> 01:42.325
and I promise, I'll
make them go easy on you.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.486
And maybe even, one day,

01:45.522 --> 01:47.238
I'll help you join
the Organization.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.025
Really? You'd do that for me?

01:50.060 --> 01:52.970
Of course I would, sweetheart.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.579
Then you're dumber
than I thought.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.849
Hey, hey!

01:56.884 --> 01:58.275
You call my mom dumb
one more time,

01:58.310 --> 02:01.869
you're gonna see what that smile
looks like without your teeth.

02:01.905 --> 02:03.883
I cannot believe I let your
smart mouth borrow my lip gloss.

02:03.907 --> 02:06.174
Hey, I gave it back...

02:06.210 --> 02:07.917
right after I dropped it
in the toilet.

02:07.952 --> 02:10.679
She's giving us nothing.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.189
Except maybe E.coli.

02:13.224 --> 02:15.775
I used that lip gloss
all the time.

02:15.810 --> 02:18.211
Put her in maximum security.

02:18.246 --> 02:20.006
We'll use Abby
to draw Richard and Erica out.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.334
I doubt they even care
that she's gone.

02:24.369 --> 02:26.553
They got my baby.

02:26.588 --> 02:28.639
I want her back.

02:28.674 --> 02:31.625
I want her back!

02:31.660 --> 02:34.811
Enough drama.
We'll get her back.

02:34.846 --> 02:37.872
Well, we better,
because she's the only one

02:37.908 --> 02:40.834
that can remember
my Wi-Fi password.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.237
Mother of the year.

02:43.272 --> 02:45.497
You should talk.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.549
It's not like you've
been the best dad.

02:47.585 --> 02:51.036
No, "mother of the year."
It's your password.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.298
They have something we want,

03:03.333 --> 03:06.635
and soon, we'll have
something they want.

03:18.081 --> 03:19.856
Hurry up, Kira.
These things are hot.

03:22.727 --> 03:26.905
You're the one who wanted
all those rotisserie chickens.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.316
They were on sale,
five for five dollars.

03:29.351 --> 03:31.918
Because they expired
two days ago.

03:31.953 --> 03:33.978
No. The label says "sell by."

03:34.013 --> 03:35.722
Not "use by," "sell by."

03:35.757 --> 03:37.424
Yeah, they all good.

03:37.459 --> 03:39.985
Can we just get inside?

03:40.020 --> 03:43.463
This 24-pack of body spray
is getting heavy.

03:43.498 --> 03:46.925
FYI: That place is not
supposed to replace showers.

03:46.961 --> 03:49.427
( Helicopter rotors whirring )

03:55.619 --> 03:58.478
What is going on?!

04:01.332 --> 04:04.676
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

04:04.711 --> 04:07.829
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

04:07.831 --> 04:11.783
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

04:11.818 --> 04:15.762
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

04:15.798 --> 04:19.466
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

04:19.501 --> 04:21.559
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

04:21.595 --> 04:25.630
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

04:25.665 --> 04:29.567
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

04:29.603 --> 04:31.636
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

04:31.671 --> 04:33.955
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

04:33.990 --> 04:36.182
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

04:36.218 --> 04:38.293
¶ But I always got your back ¶

04:38.328 --> 04:40.137
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

04:40.172 --> 04:42.380
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

04:42.415 --> 04:45.308
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

04:45.343 --> 04:46.420
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

04:46.444 --> 04:48.728
I keep it undercover.

04:48.763 --> 04:49.763
I keep it undercover.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.643
That movie was nuts.

04:55.678 --> 04:57.078
I did not see
that ending coming.

04:57.114 --> 04:59.405
You didn't see
the beginning either

04:59.441 --> 05:00.398
because you were on
your phone the whole time.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.375
What happened here?

05:09.301 --> 05:11.718
Marisa, I think
my family's been taken.

05:11.753 --> 05:14.095
I think there's a much simpler
explanation than that.

05:16.474 --> 05:19.692
My father would never
waste a chicken.

05:19.727 --> 05:23.963
The man eats the bones.

05:23.998 --> 05:25.982
Oh, no, your family
has been taken.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.749
Let us out of here!

05:38.430 --> 05:40.931
For a little girl,
you have a very big mouth.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.392
I'm a robot, doofus!

05:44.428 --> 05:47.837
Yeah, I put that together
when I took you apart.

05:52.127 --> 05:53.968
Kira, talk to her. Talk to her.

05:56.790 --> 06:00.099
Erica, listen to me.
Now at the end of the day,

06:00.134 --> 06:02.802
I'm still your sister,
and I care about you.

06:02.838 --> 06:06.080
Mother to mother, I know
that you're worried about Abby.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.509
Just let us go, and I promise,

06:09.544 --> 06:12.111
I will give her
the life she deserves.

06:12.147 --> 06:15.740
The life you were denied.

06:18.445 --> 06:21.513
Kira, can I tell you something that
I've never shared with you before?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.556
Please do.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.551
Not only are you a lousy spy,

06:26.586 --> 06:28.420
you're a lousy actress.

06:33.952 --> 06:36.144
KC, we've created a map
of all the places

06:36.179 --> 06:38.004
where your family could be.

06:38.039 --> 06:40.948
That's a map
of the entire world.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.960
Yeah. We have no idea
where they are.

06:43.995 --> 06:46.421
Well, we have to find them.

06:46.456 --> 06:49.032
ERICA: <i>Now that we have
your attention...</i>

06:49.067 --> 06:50.633
It's not that easy, KC.

06:50.668 --> 06:52.535
( Richard clearing throat )

06:52.570 --> 06:55.154
<i>Now that we have
your attention...</i>

06:55.189 --> 06:57.248
Unless Richard and Erica
show their faces,

06:57.283 --> 06:59.008
we don't stand a chance.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.118
<i>Hello!</i>

07:03.514 --> 07:05.332
Well, speak of the devil...

07:05.367 --> 07:07.567
and her husband.

07:07.602 --> 07:09.544
<i>Some of our guests
would like to say hi.</i>

07:13.809 --> 07:14.969
<i>Don't worry, honey. We're okay.</i>

07:14.993 --> 07:17.268
CRAIG:<i> Hey, KC,</i>

07:17.303 --> 07:20.088
<i>did you get a chance to put those
rotisserie chickens in the fridge?</i>

07:20.123 --> 07:23.358
<i>I don't want 'em to go bad.</i>

07:23.435 --> 07:26.702
<i>Craig, they were bad
when you bought 'em.</i>

07:26.738 --> 07:29.380
<i>Who eats a chicken
that costs a dollar?</i>

07:29.415 --> 07:31.866
<i>Just put 'em in the fridge.</i>

07:31.901 --> 07:33.918
<i>Annoying and cheap.</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:36.337
<i>My sister can really pick 'em.</i>

07:36.373 --> 07:39.090
<i>We will exchange our prisoners
for yours.</i>

07:39.125 --> 07:42.160
<i>You'll be contacted with
instructions for the hand-off.</i>

07:45.982 --> 07:49.050
I'll lead the rescue team.

07:49.086 --> 07:51.786
- KC, we do not negotiate with the Other Side.
- But my family...

07:51.822 --> 07:53.902
Knew what they were getting
into when they signed on.

07:57.552 --> 07:59.652
The Organization may not be
willing to negotiate,

07:59.687 --> 08:00.970
but I am.

08:08.579 --> 08:11.339
If that's a new dance,
it's whack.

08:11.374 --> 08:14.534
Untie me and I'll
show you whack.

08:14.569 --> 08:17.253
Abby, the last time
I eliminated you,

08:17.288 --> 08:19.313
it was an accident.

08:19.349 --> 08:21.699
This time, it will just
look like an accident.

08:25.664 --> 08:27.266
<i>Word on the street is someone
broke Abby out of prison.</i>

08:27.290 --> 08:29.524
<i>And it must be you,</i>

08:29.559 --> 08:31.834
<i>because who else
would want that girl?</i>

08:31.870 --> 08:35.430
Thanks for checking in, Mother.

08:35.507 --> 08:37.234
Look, she's all yours
once I get my family back,

08:37.258 --> 08:39.284
so where we supposed to meet?

08:39.319 --> 08:40.969
<i>Just keep driving.
We'll be watching.</i>

08:49.338 --> 08:51.646
Please tell me this is
some type of alien abduction.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.203
Okay, I know this looks
like I went rogue,

09:07.239 --> 09:09.113
broke Abby out of prison,

09:09.148 --> 09:12.349
but the truth is,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.828
she escaped, and I caught her,

09:14.863 --> 09:16.006
and I was bringing her
back to you.

09:16.030 --> 09:18.706
So you're welcome.

09:18.742 --> 09:22.485
Then why were you driving
in the opposite direction?

09:22.521 --> 09:25.005
Okay, fine. So I
broke her out of prison,

09:25.040 --> 09:26.539
but what else
was I supposed to do?

09:26.575 --> 09:28.324
They have my family.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.534
You're out of
the Organization, KC.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.462
This time, you're not
getting back in.

09:32.497 --> 09:34.947
In fact, you'll be lucky
to avoid jail time.

09:34.983 --> 09:37.143
Put this prisoner in the
helicopter with the other one.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.716
KC: Sorry!

10:07.557 --> 10:09.157
So what's your plan, KC?

10:09.192 --> 10:11.292
For you to be quiet.

10:11.327 --> 10:12.343
Do you even have a plan?

10:12.378 --> 10:14.696
Yeah. For you to be quiet.

10:14.731 --> 10:16.881
Now we won't know
the rendezvous point,

10:16.917 --> 10:20.351
because my parents were tracking
your car and not this helicopter.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.945
You messed everything up.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.030
( Shrieking )

10:27.143 --> 10:28.404
On second thought, I'm sure
it'll all be fine.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.662
( Phone ringing )

10:33.683 --> 10:35.533
Now's not really
a good time, Marisa.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.534
Okay, but it's really important.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.711
Kind of a life and death
situation.

10:38.746 --> 10:40.947
Marisa, I am currently flying
a stolen helicopter,

10:40.982 --> 10:43.475
I have no idea where my
family's being held captive,

10:43.510 --> 10:44.721
and I have to find them
and rescue them,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.678
because they've been taken
by the head of the Other Side,

10:47.713 --> 10:49.313
who I also have to capture
and bring in,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.141
because if I don't, I will be going
to jail and losing my family.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.888
<i>I have gone rogue, I have no
one to turn to for help.</i>

10:53.912 --> 10:56.637
So please, please,

10:56.673 --> 11:00.266
share with me
your life or death situation!

11:00.301 --> 11:03.361
I was wondering if you wanted
to watch<i> House Boos</i> with me.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.417
Okay, in retrospect,

11:09.494 --> 11:11.744
your situation might be
a bit more dire than mine.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.566
But seriously,
it's the finale, so...

11:16.601 --> 11:18.517
- Good-bye, Marisa.
- <i>Wait, wait.</i>

11:18.553 --> 11:20.113
- What can I do to help?
- Stop calling.

11:22.799 --> 11:24.790
You are gonna call
your parents right now

11:24.826 --> 11:26.476
and you're gonna demand
a new meeting point.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.569
You tell them that if they
do not have my family,

11:28.605 --> 11:31.606
they will never see you again.

11:31.683 --> 11:34.258
That's not much of a threat,
but it's all I got.

11:34.294 --> 11:38.480
That is the stupidest
plan I have ever heard.

11:38.515 --> 11:39.564
( Shrieking )

11:43.027 --> 11:44.907
On second thought,
your plan could totally work.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.993
All right, it's swap time.

11:52.028 --> 11:54.057
I'll give you back Abby,
you give me back my family.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.064
You got it.

11:56.099 --> 11:58.249
Soon as you put your weapon down
and Abby's safe,

11:58.284 --> 12:00.543
you and your family
will be free to go.

12:00.579 --> 12:02.512
I'm sorry, put down my weapon?

12:02.547 --> 12:03.320
Do I look like an idiot to you?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.757
Yes. Yes, you do.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.045
Hey, listen, I am
in charge here.

12:11.081 --> 12:12.849
You give me my family back,
I'll give you Abby back.

12:12.873 --> 12:15.650
No deal.

12:15.685 --> 12:18.602
Wait. Now I know she's not much,

12:18.638 --> 12:19.798
but she's your only daughter.

12:22.024 --> 12:23.724
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:23.759 --> 12:25.109
Okay.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.457
Now if I agree
to put my weapon down,

12:30.533 --> 12:32.302
how do I know that
you're gonna let my family go?

12:32.326 --> 12:34.251
KC, don't be insulting.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.830
Do we look like a couple of lowlifes
to you that would welch on a deal?

12:39.309 --> 12:42.168
Yes. Yes, you do.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.756
In a show of good faith,

12:46.791 --> 12:48.800
let's put all our guns
down on the table.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.567
Your turn.

13:07.112 --> 13:08.402
Oops, we lied.

13:10.056 --> 13:13.391
We are a couple of lowlifes
that would welch on a deal.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.369
Finally something come out
of your mouth that I believe.

13:29.817 --> 13:31.951
Well, sorry, guys. I tried.

13:31.986 --> 13:34.770
Don't worry, baby.
A little while ago,

13:34.806 --> 13:36.475
I heard a helicopter land on the roof.
I think it's the Organization.

13:36.499 --> 13:41.727
Well, uh, it is
the Organization's helicopter,

13:41.762 --> 13:44.689
but technically,
I kinda stole it from 'em.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.821
Don't worry, honey,
I'm sure they're tracking you,

13:48.845 --> 13:49.751
and they'll be here any second.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.113
Yeah, normally, I would agree,

13:52.148 --> 13:54.791
but technically,

13:54.826 --> 13:57.135
I kinda turned off
the tracking device.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.286
They'll still come.

13:59.321 --> 14:00.974
It's not like they stopped
caring about us.

14:00.998 --> 14:03.424
Absolutely, absolutely.

14:03.459 --> 14:06.336
Although technically...

14:06.371 --> 14:07.795
We're doomed.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.369
Voicemail again.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.164
KC needs my help.

14:18.199 --> 14:20.225
I have to figure out
where she is.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.460
I can do this.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.228
Who am I kidding?
I can't do this.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.058
No, wait. I'm not stupid.

14:29.093 --> 14:31.510
I'll just find out
the information

14:31.546 --> 14:34.455
from the computer.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.624
Okay, if she's in a helicopter,

14:36.659 --> 14:39.319
she has to land it somewhere.

14:39.354 --> 14:44.723
Where can you land a helicopter?

14:44.759 --> 14:46.519
Probably don't wanna land
a stolen helicopter

14:46.552 --> 14:47.835
at a police station.

14:50.339 --> 14:51.897
News 4 Traffic Center,

14:51.933 --> 14:54.659
or in front of a news crew.

14:54.694 --> 14:58.979
The abandoned hospital
downtown has a helipad.

14:59.014 --> 15:01.374
An abandoned hospital?

15:01.409 --> 15:04.193
Ew. That's the last place
I'd ever wanna go.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.781
In fact, I don't know anyone
in their right mind

15:05.805 --> 15:07.296
who would go near that creepy...

15:07.331 --> 15:08.451
Hey, that must be the place.

15:10.968 --> 15:14.086
Wow, my computer teacher
was right.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.321
This thing is so much more
than a shoe-shopping machine.

15:20.436 --> 15:22.253
I say we leave the Coopers here,

15:22.288 --> 15:25.739
and blow this place up.

15:25.775 --> 15:28.250
Why is everything always
"blow up the building" with you?

15:28.286 --> 15:29.793
Can't you think outside the box?

15:29.829 --> 15:31.504
I'd like to put you in a box.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.230
Six feet under.

15:33.265 --> 15:37.126
And I'd like to take the shovel
you use to dig the hole,

15:37.161 --> 15:38.761
and hit you
over the head with it.

15:38.797 --> 15:40.555
You do it,
you gangly armed giant.

15:40.590 --> 15:41.889
Try it, try it.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.569
What are you doing?

15:46.571 --> 15:49.163
Looking for a scalpel
so I can cut my ears off,

15:49.199 --> 15:51.282
so I don't have to listen
to you two anymore!

15:51.317 --> 15:54.986
Where does she get
all this hostility from?

15:58.675 --> 16:01.192
I'm really sorry.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.294
I feel like this is
all my fault.

16:03.371 --> 16:05.947
I may never get another chance
to say this, so...

16:05.982 --> 16:08.232
Hey, don't talk like that.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.669
I just wanted to say that
I love... Marisa.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.133
You love Marisa?

16:18.695 --> 16:20.903
You love Marisa?!

16:20.938 --> 16:23.071
Guys, look. Marisa.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.407
Yes! Marisa came to save us.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.360
Wait, Marisa came to save us?

16:27.395 --> 16:29.979
How did Marisa know
we needed saving?

16:30.014 --> 16:32.223
Well, I kinda sorta may have
at one point

16:32.258 --> 16:34.617
accidentally mentioned...

16:34.652 --> 16:36.494
Okay, I told her we were spies.

16:36.571 --> 16:37.631
Yeah, she found out,
but you memory sprayed her.

16:37.655 --> 16:39.063
We saw you.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.640
Yeah, but I kinda swapped

16:41.675 --> 16:43.859
that memory spray out
for perfume.

16:43.894 --> 16:45.778
So she's known all along?

16:45.813 --> 16:46.788
I cannot believe
what I am hearing.

16:46.823 --> 16:48.247
Neither can I.

16:50.268 --> 16:51.851
This is shocking.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.262
Shocking news to me.

16:54.297 --> 16:56.104
I can barely process
what I'm hearing.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.706
You knew, too, didn't you?

16:57.741 --> 16:59.950
Yeah.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.895
Judy, please tell me
you didn't know.

17:02.930 --> 17:05.447
- Okay. I didn't know.
- Judy.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.483
Hey, it's not my fault
you didn't know

17:07.518 --> 17:09.626
what was going on
under your own roof.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.662
Some spy you are.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.581
Kira, did you know, too?

17:14.617 --> 17:16.767
Nope. Apparently, I'm
just as dumb as you are.

17:16.802 --> 17:20.946
Guys, if I hadn't told her, she
wouldn't be here to rescue us.

17:20.981 --> 17:23.791
And how exactly
is she going to rescue us?

17:23.826 --> 17:26.210
We're locked down here,
she's up there,

17:26.287 --> 17:27.681
and the only thing I've ever
seen her break into

17:27.705 --> 17:29.496
is her mother's purse.

17:29.532 --> 17:33.317
Marisa, break the glass.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.919
( Mouthing words )

17:51.995 --> 17:54.188
Well, nice knowing you guys.

17:56.459 --> 17:58.579
Come on, Marisa, you can do
this, okay? Try something.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.723
She's cutting through the glass
with her diamond earrings.

18:09.747 --> 18:11.230
We're saved.

18:11.266 --> 18:15.867
- Oh.
- What?

18:15.903 --> 18:17.397
Well, I got her
those earrings for Christmas,

18:17.421 --> 18:19.496
and they were 20 bucks.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.323
I just kinda told her
they were diamonds.

18:21.358 --> 18:24.468
Like father, like daughter.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.218
What the heck is she doing?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.837
Showing us
what a big mouth she has?

18:51.872 --> 18:53.205
We already knew that.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.000
No.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.701
She's right, she's not dumb.
She's smart.

18:57.736 --> 19:01.847
She's also someone whose grandma
made her take opera lessons.

19:01.882 --> 19:04.133
( Singing high note )

19:06.620 --> 19:07.887
Amazing!

19:07.922 --> 19:09.221
Yes!

19:11.843 --> 19:12.843
What is going on in here?

19:20.760 --> 19:21.760
Okay, that just happened.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.945
Hey, untie me.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.741
Not so fast.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.540
Nice! Let's go.

19:41.797 --> 19:43.422
Hey. No one messes with
my best friend.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.988
I'm sorry.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.182
I always wanted to be
an only child,

20:16.206 --> 20:17.331
and now I'm about to be.

20:27.634 --> 20:29.260
Need a hand... or a leg?

20:30.954 --> 20:31.954
Ooh, nice, Judy.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.569
Way to go, KC.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.531
What's going on in here?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.775
Not so tall anymore, is he?

21:01.810 --> 21:04.245
Marisa, I never thought
I'd say this,

21:04.280 --> 21:06.389
but boy, am I happy to see you.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.065
And if we're putting
all our cards on the table,

21:09.101 --> 21:11.260
you should know KC loves you.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.794
Hey, what's up, guys?

21:20.830 --> 21:22.888
Okay, okay, okay.

21:22.924 --> 21:25.241
Is this because I freed
a dangerous prisoner

21:25.243 --> 21:27.434
and stole a helicopter,
or because I forgot to put

21:27.470 --> 21:28.722
the office bagels away
without that twist-tie thing?

21:28.746 --> 21:30.712
Cuff her.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.232
Okay, hey. Before you do that,

21:33.267 --> 21:35.292
you should know,
I saved my family.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.144
Glad they're okay,
but not good enough.

21:37.180 --> 21:38.829
I also have Abby.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.358
Still not good enough.

21:43.393 --> 21:45.127
Oh, wait, wait. And Erica.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.474
Still not...

21:50.510 --> 21:51.884
Bup-bup-bup.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.181
And Richard, the head of
the Other Side.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.092
And a box of doughnuts.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.320
All right, all is forgiven.

22:13.548 --> 22:14.965
Put these three in a cell.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.851
No, I'll do anything to get out
of sharing a cell with her.

22:17.886 --> 22:20.320
- You should be so lucky.
- ( both arguing )

22:20.356 --> 22:22.106
Please, I'm begging you.
Put me in solitary.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.894
Oh, don't worry. You'll all
have your own private cells.

22:23.918 --> 22:25.250
Hey.

22:28.281 --> 22:30.033
Try to keep 'em together
as long as possible.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.724
With any luck,
they'll kill each other.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.960
Oh, and also, if Abby asks for
lip gloss, give her this.

22:38.407 --> 22:41.275
So how did you manage
to take down

22:41.310 --> 22:42.292
the head of the Other Side?

22:42.327 --> 22:47.773
Uh, it was all KC. 100% KC.

22:47.808 --> 22:49.691
Well, Dad, we can't lie
to Agent Johnson.

22:52.779 --> 22:53.904
It was a group effort.

23:02.457 --> 23:04.707
( Ringing )

23:04.742 --> 23:06.291
Yes.

23:09.780 --> 23:12.214
You're sure
Richard was captured?

23:12.249 --> 23:14.550
So who's now in charge
of the Other Side?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.931
I was hoping you'd say that.

23:25.045 --> 23:26.562
Looks like I'm going home.

23:30.334 --> 23:32.401
See you soon, KC.

23:38.234 --> 23:40.584
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
