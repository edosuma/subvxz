WEBVTT

00:08.367 --> 00:10.955
You know, before we decided not to have sex.

00:11.036 --> 00:12.311
you decided.

00:13.418 --> 00:14.780
I'm ready.

00:16.706 --> 00:18.752
Right. I decided.

00:18.802 --> 00:22.141
Movies were just a dark place to fool around
before we went home and did it,

00:22.201 --> 00:23.606
but now

00:23.690 --> 00:26.311
we can really watch the movie.

00:26.395 --> 00:28.123
Isn't that great?

00:28.833 --> 00:30.537
It's fabulous.

00:31.497 --> 00:33.904
I mean, there's nothing
I hate more than the feeling

00:33.988 --> 00:35.708
that I'm about to have sex.

00:37.176 --> 00:38.455
Hi.

00:38.643 --> 00:39.881
Hi!

00:40.090 --> 00:41.076
Hey!

00:42.208 --> 00:43.341
Hi!

00:46.325 --> 00:47.478
Okay.

00:49.072 --> 00:51.400
Isn't that the girl who sells slurpees?

00:51.591 --> 00:53.141
Why is she saying "hi"
to you?

00:53.227 --> 00:56.667
I don't know. It's weird.
I've never talked to her before.

00:56.751 --> 00:58.931
I mean, maybe one time I said,

00:59.015 --> 01:01.490
"you're out of spoon straws,"
but that's it.

01:06.396 --> 01:07.086
great.

01:07.113 --> 01:10.906
Now I have to sit through "Kramer vs. Kramer"
again with no shot at nookie.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.590
First time we saw it,  I said, "you know,

01:13.737 --> 01:16.086
dads can be good parents, too,"

01:16.149 --> 01:17.827
and Donna's shirt just

01:17.932 --> 01:19.379
floated off.

01:20.658 --> 01:22.461
what is wrong with me?

01:22.524 --> 01:26.257
A boy's gonna lose his mother, and all
I can think about is fooling around.

01:26.362 --> 01:28.082
I am such a dirty girl.

01:28.312 --> 01:31.164
I should be spanked.
Ooh, stop it!

01:31.751 --> 01:34.813
Screw it. Sneak attack is my only hope.

01:35.715 --> 01:37.833
I'm gonna go with the yawn and grab.

01:37.896 --> 01:41.670
Watch out for my hand, pretty mama,
'cause I'm not really tired.

01:41.964 --> 01:44.375
Oh, god. It's the yawn and grab.

01:45.969 --> 01:47.332
How do I stop it?

01:47.479 --> 01:48.528
Oops!

01:49.576 --> 01:52.030
Oh, sorry.

01:52.324 --> 01:55.700
Oh, come on.
It's okay.

01:56.014 --> 01:56.916
Great.

01:57.084 --> 02:00.607
Now my lap's covered
in hot buttered popcorn.

02:01.069 --> 02:03.627
That's the most action
I've gotten in weeks.

02:06.857 --> 02:07.528
Oh,

02:07.780 --> 02:11.873
thanks for helping move Pam into my house, Kitty.
You know what they say...

02:11.953 --> 02:14.175
lady number three's a charm.

02:15.496 --> 02:20.320
You have been so warm and friendly.
You simply must teach me how to be like that.

02:21.934 --> 02:26.737
Pam, I'd just like to say
on behalf of Fez and myself,

02:26.821 --> 02:30.567
that it is a privilege and a turn-on
to carry your underthings.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.356
And you don't have to pay me.
I took a few souvenirs.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.390
Well, enjoy.

02:40.305 --> 02:44.478
Oh, Red, I'd help you with the boxes,
but I don't want to tire myself out.

02:44.626 --> 02:48.023
I'm gonna be up all night
welcoming Pam to the house.

02:48.349 --> 02:51.650
Okay, see you later. Have fun.
Close your shades.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.635
What do we do with these boxes?

02:55.865 --> 02:57.601
Let's just stick 'em in there.

03:02.123 --> 03:03.859
Hi, boys.

Mitch, what are you doing here?

03:51.272 --> 03:55.789
Oh, I made a peach cobbler for Donna, and I forgot
to leave it when I was in here last night.

03:56.259 --> 03:58.071
You weren't in here last night.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.732
Well, not as far as you know.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.915
Okay, look, Mitch, I know you're in love with her,
but it's not gonna work out.

04:04.949 --> 04:07.007
You're as big as you're gonna get.

04:07.562 --> 04:10.900
And trust me, okay? Donna's still growing.

04:12.242 --> 04:13.903
Jackie, we need to talk.

04:14.104 --> 04:17.259
Eric and I came really close to doing it,
and I am so jacked-up on hormones,

04:17.309 --> 04:20.043
I feel like I could jump the first guy I see.

04:21.536 --> 04:23.516
Then look my way, pretty lady.

04:26.636 --> 04:28.011
Okay, Mitch,

04:28.062 --> 04:30.863
you know I love having you around
'cause you say really nice things about me.

04:30.913 --> 04:34.721
Like how the sun pales in radiance
to the beauty of your smile?

04:35.999 --> 04:37.408
- Yeah, like that.
- Yeah.

04:38.448 --> 04:41.921
But I have to talk to Jackie, and it's girl stuff.

04:41.972 --> 04:43.733
Oh, you're so strong.

04:44.890 --> 04:47.306
You make me feel like Jessica Lange in "King Kong."

04:53.652 --> 04:54.809
Hey, Red.

04:55.179 --> 04:56.202
Hi, boys.

04:59.909 --> 05:03.131
I could kill you without making a sound.

05:05.227 --> 05:07.979
You know, I'm worried we don't have
enough chicken for dinner tonight.

05:08.029 --> 05:10.127
Do these breasts look big enough?

05:13.549 --> 05:15.813
I'm not comfortable with that question.

05:17.541 --> 05:18.347
- What?
- What?

05:18.397 --> 05:18.984
What?

05:23.732 --> 05:25.226
What are you laughing at?

05:25.293 --> 05:27.859
Just life. It's a hoot.

05:29.302 --> 05:30.258
Well,

05:30.376 --> 05:34.252
I don't know what's in that orange juice,
but I'm gonna pour myself a glass.

05:35.913 --> 05:40.740
- Red, what I want to know is, what did Pam mean?
- Not here... Toyota.

05:41.891 --> 05:44.256
This is the only place that's safe.

05:45.347 --> 05:46.320
Look,

05:47.008 --> 05:48.752
if I was a single man,

05:48.871 --> 05:53.803
what we saw today would be, like,
a reward for a life time of disappointments.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.007
But I'm not.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.910
So it's just another disappointment.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.963
For you, maybe.

06:03.031 --> 06:05.329
I saw 'em. I don't care who knows it.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.343
You better care, 'cause if Kitty finds out,

06:08.393 --> 06:10.406
I'm taking you down with me.

06:11.380 --> 06:14.936
And when I take people down,
they stay down.

06:15.591 --> 06:17.671
Just ask North Korea.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.275
But I have so many questions.

06:23.325 --> 06:25.170
I mean, I've been flashed before.

06:25.204 --> 06:27.603
But it was always followed with either,
"Get out!"

06:27.670 --> 06:30.606
Or "There's a 2-drink minimum,"

06:32.234 --> 06:33.894
but, "Hi, boys"?

06:34.901 --> 06:36.847
It has me reeling.

06:38.256 --> 06:40.906
Oh, maybe she was coming on to us.

06:42.015 --> 06:44.219
She wasn't coming onto us.

06:45.152 --> 06:47.289
She was coming onto me.

06:50.017 --> 06:52.425
She heard about my war record.

06:54.102 --> 06:55.444
I'm a hero.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.037
You know why Darth Vader went to the dark side?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.486
He was dating a redhead who wouldn't put out.

07:07.959 --> 07:12.530
So you are like Darth Vader
in the sense that you're not getting any.

07:12.665 --> 07:16.053
But you are not like Darth Vader in the sense that

07:16.120 --> 07:18.670
you are weak and strike fin no one.

07:20.448 --> 07:23.216
Well, this is certainly one way to spend an afternoon.

07:23.275 --> 07:25.691
I never really got into making models.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.643
Guess I was too busy having sex.

07:29.633 --> 07:32.451
Hey, I don't have sex,
and I still don't build models.

07:32.502 --> 07:36.545
I don't have a single model or a single girl.
My life is an empty hole.

07:37.854 --> 07:41.293
Hey, nice job. You put the force
field generators on backwards.

07:41.326 --> 07:44.211
One photon torpedo, and you're space toast.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.307
Okay, Eric, that's it.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.081
I think we should have sex.

07:50.174 --> 07:51.713
- Yes!
- No!

07:55.487 --> 07:58.373
Okay, I'm going crazy not being with you.

07:58.457 --> 08:00.017
You may not be a strong man,

08:00.789 --> 08:03.491
but you read my body like braille.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.510
Burn!

08:09.429 --> 08:12.387
Wait. W-what's "braille"?

08:18.572 --> 08:22.959
You two were awfully quiet at dinner tonight.
Is there anything I should know about?

08:23.010 --> 08:23.781
- No.
- No.

08:25.962 --> 08:27.950
- I'll get it.
- Me too.

08:31.146 --> 08:32.621
Hi, boys.

08:34.585 --> 08:35.679
Oh, Kitty,

08:35.761 --> 08:41.328
every time I come to this house I'm amazed
by how much you've done with so little.

08:42.269 --> 08:44.434
Here. We brought Kahlúa.

08:44.484 --> 08:48.594
Well, aren't you just an angel sent
from after-dinner drink heaven?

08:49.467 --> 08:53.409
She wanted to get you cookies,
but I know how much you like the sauce.

08:56.881 --> 08:58.459
- Red...
- Toyota!

09:00.354 --> 09:02.698
Did you see that look she just gave us?

09:04.263 --> 09:05.185
Was that,

09:05.269 --> 09:08.399
"Please don't tell anyone you saw my boobs"?

09:09.950 --> 09:12.894
Or, "Please come over and see my boobs again"?

09:13.524 --> 09:16.544
Do you have to keep saying that word?

09:17.819 --> 09:19.597
Let's just call them...

09:19.982 --> 09:20.788
"Them."

09:22.633 --> 09:27.314
This is the last time we ever talk about it.
From here on out, it never happened.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.109
- But, Red--
- Steven,

09:29.176 --> 09:31.994
I have been to war.

09:32.347 --> 09:34.897
I have seen a lot of things in my life.

09:34.947 --> 09:39.493
And there only three things that I was gonna
keep secret until the day I die.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.512
This is number four.

09:44.661 --> 09:45.914
And five.

09:49.993 --> 09:53.097
Okay, the tractor beam is operational.

09:53.181 --> 09:55.119
Don't get too close.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.075
You really gonna shine your love light on that?

09:59.934 --> 10:03.415
Well, he's a different person between the sheets.
What can I say?

10:05.261 --> 10:07.086
Hey, guys. Hey, listen,

10:07.253 --> 10:10.672
tomorrow I have this police test
on interrogation techniques.

10:10.735 --> 10:14.048
I was wondering if I could practice on somebody.
Jackie, how about you?

10:14.132 --> 10:18.724
Oh, well, no. This is your first time. You're gonna
need somebody much more spineless than me.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.587
Try Eric.

10:22.201 --> 10:24.151
Yeah, that's good thinking.

10:24.403 --> 10:27.632
All right, Mr. Forman,

10:27.742 --> 10:30.846
if that is indeed your real name...

10:32.272 --> 10:36.067
what did you do on the day of yesterday?

10:37.954 --> 10:40.932
you'll never get it out of me, copper. I'm no rat!

10:48.104 --> 10:50.506
Kelso, what the hell?!

10:51.900 --> 10:55.905
Oh, just relax, Eric.
I'm just doing good cop/bad cop.

10:56.241 --> 10:58.871
That was the bad cop, but he's gone now.

10:59.588 --> 11:02.471
See, now good cop is here to take care of you.

11:02.555 --> 11:04.571
Hey, how you doin', buddy?

11:06.055 --> 11:09.321
It's a real shame about what happened
to your model.

11:11.022 --> 11:14.255
Why don't you tell me what you did yesterday?

11:15.605 --> 11:17.580
I came home from the restaurant

11:17.730 --> 11:21.213
and spent six hours building that model!

11:23.213 --> 11:25.863
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,

11:25.913 --> 11:29.546
but what about your encounter at the store
with the girl who sells slurpees?

11:30.304 --> 11:31.747
What?

11:32.347 --> 11:36.247
Yeah, you remember. She asked why you never call
her anymore. You were like...

11:36.563 --> 11:37.630
ooh.

11:43.277 --> 11:45.144
Wait. Is that the girl from the movies?

11:45.196 --> 11:47.277
Donna, I'm asking the questions here.

11:50.594 --> 11:52.244
Was that the girl from the movies?

11:53.537 --> 11:54.970
What happened to, "I barely know her"?

11:55.004 --> 11:57.087
What happened to, "I barely know her"?

11:58.187 --> 11:59.437
Why were you calling her, Eric?

11:59.504 --> 12:02.287
- Why were you calling her, Eric?
- Kelso, will you shut up?!

12:02.337 --> 12:04.770
Oh, yeah, it's getting hot in here, isn't it?!

12:10.754 --> 12:11.854
Look, Donna...

12:12.771 --> 12:14.587
maybe I kinda know her.

12:15.221 --> 12:16.954
Maybe we kinda went out a

12:17.004 --> 12:19.604
couple times when you were
dating Kelso's brother

12:19.787 --> 12:23.220
Wait. You got other girls besides
Donna to go out with you?

12:24.937 --> 12:27.287
What is this obsession with the underdog?

12:27.904 --> 12:29.037
So

12:29.570 --> 12:31.453
the other day at the movies
you lied to me?

12:31.520 --> 12:32.437
Donna,

12:32.487 --> 12:34.553
I am the senior officer here.

12:36.820 --> 12:39.687
So the other day at the movies you lied to me.

12:41.687 --> 12:42.953
No, I...

12:43.037 --> 12:46.020
you know, I mean, it was the movies, you know?

12:46.676 --> 12:48.159
It's all make-believe.

12:51.059 --> 12:52.492
Okay, you know what?

12:52.542 --> 12:54.276
Don't bother coming over tonight.

12:54.342 --> 12:57.721
My sexual tension has been replaced
with another familiar emotion--

12:57.771 --> 13:00.121
anger at your scrawny ass!

13:00.438 --> 13:02.504
- No!
- Yes!

13:05.371 --> 13:07.204
Well, good job, Michael.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.063
You solved one crime
and prevented an even bigger one...

13:10.163 --> 13:12.396
Donna having sex with Eric.

13:13.729 --> 13:17.979
You have the right to remain...
BURN!

13:22.263 --> 13:24.430
I'm just glad I could help the truth be told.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.096
Yeah, at least someone's being honest around here.

13:30.630 --> 13:31.563
Mitch,

13:32.447 --> 13:33.997
what the hell?

13:34.347 --> 13:36.813
What. I thought you came off looking great.
Oh, wait.

13:37.063 --> 13:38.296
That was me.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.790
Everyone, I want to thank you for making me so welcome.

13:48.894 --> 13:53.868
I feel like the only guest
at an inexpensive backwoods hotel.

13:56.732 --> 13:58.686
Steven, you're so tense.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.223
Of course he's tense, mom.

14:01.301 --> 14:07.473
You're the one who taught me that if your man's not tense when you
walking to the room, that means you're doing something wrong.

14:08.202 --> 14:10.962
Yeah, that's right. I'm tense because of you,

14:11.171 --> 14:12.577
'cause you're..

14:13.361 --> 14:14.872
too pretty.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.762
Oh, Red,

14:17.814 --> 14:21.538
I was gonna get you a thank you gift
for helping with the move, but then I figured,

14:21.642 --> 14:22.736
nah.

14:24.350 --> 14:25.939
So thanks.

14:27.007 --> 14:28.569
Don't mention it, Bob.

14:28.725 --> 14:33.439
Don't mention anything about that day ever again.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.199
Why? It was a pretty good day.

14:36.303 --> 14:38.777
Nothing got broken. Nobody got hurt.

14:38.855 --> 14:41.902
You two even got to see Pam topless.

14:48.419 --> 14:51.778
Yeah, first time I saw 'em, I was speechless, too.

14:59.257 --> 15:00.432
Alright.

15:00.823 --> 15:03.323
I admit that we saw Pam's

15:04.573 --> 15:05.849
them.

15:08.870 --> 15:10.745
But it's not like we planned it.

15:10.797 --> 15:13.453
Although our timing couldn't have been better.

15:14.312 --> 15:16.760
Oh, I think you mean "worse," steven.

15:17.385 --> 15:19.286
No, I'm pretty sure I meant "better."

15:21.369 --> 15:23.270
Red, how could you?

15:23.349 --> 15:27.021
Kitty, we just opened the door, and there she was.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.875
What was I supposed to do,
rip the eyes out of my head?

15:32.568 --> 15:35.380
Don't feel bad, you guys.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.922
This isn't the first time my body has caused a fight.

15:39.156 --> 15:43.140
One time I caused a riot
on a topless beach in Venezuela.

15:43.244 --> 15:47.203
Imagine what you saw, only all tanned and oiled.

15:47.307 --> 15:48.323
Oh.

15:50.803 --> 15:52.990
She told me to.

15:54.084 --> 15:58.589
Well I hate to let the cat out of the bag
and then leave, but

15:58.693 --> 16:01.480
looks like that's exactly what we're gonna do.

16:01.766 --> 16:04.136
Enjoy your fight

16:05.251 --> 16:08.719
I can't believe you saw my mother topless
and didn't tell me about it right away.

16:08.797 --> 16:12.183
What, so every time I see another woman's breasts
I'm supposed to tell you?

16:13.563 --> 16:14.891
Now I know.

16:17.157 --> 16:20.803
I am so mad.
I can't even stand to look at you.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.899
And yet you do.

16:25.790 --> 16:29.904
Because your eyes work. You see my problem?

16:31.258 --> 16:33.368
All right. All right. We're going.

16:38.316 --> 16:40.769
I can't believe Eric lied to me about that girl.

16:40.873 --> 16:43.477
I mean, we're getting married.
I should know everything about him.

16:43.581 --> 16:48.112
If I have to know that he wore
a bathing suit in the tub until he was 12...

16:48.737 --> 16:50.846
yeah, tell everybody.

16:52.409 --> 16:55.091
I should know who he dated.

16:56.055 --> 16:59.102
That's right. Just get it off your chest, Donna.

16:59.180 --> 17:02.357
all the rage and the anger and the clothing.

17:03.372 --> 17:04.983
Hey, Hey, Hey!

17:05.661 --> 17:08.368
There's only room for one
creepy pervert in this group,

17:09.307 --> 17:10.479
and that's me.

17:11.729 --> 17:14.776
Around here, i'm the one who drools over all the ladies.

17:15.296 --> 17:17.743
Well, I don't drool over all the ladies,

17:17.848 --> 17:18.760
just Donna.

17:19.046 --> 17:21.311
A specialist, ha?

17:23.108 --> 17:25.582
Ok we'll try it your way.

17:26.702 --> 17:29.385
Oh my god. You don't think Eric and that girl..

17:29.437 --> 17:31.937
Made sweet emotional love? Yes, I do.

17:33.030 --> 17:36.962
Bought many a slurpee from her. And from
what I can tell, she'll do it with anyone

17:37.822 --> 17:39.124
Did she do it with you?

17:39.254 --> 17:42.535
No, she has way too much self-respect for that.

17:45.816 --> 17:49.756
I am gonna march right in that room and
tell my mother there are consequences on her topless actions.

17:49.834 --> 17:54.443
And that she needs to start wearing pantyhose.
This isn't Las Vegas.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.844
Oopsy Doosy

18:01.813 --> 18:04.183
So then she goes, "Hi, Boys"

18:04.730 --> 18:06.996
I mean, that has to be a "Come on", right?

18:07.907 --> 18:13.532
saw this dirty movie once where the plumbers knock
on the door and the lady answers, and says "Hi, boys"

18:14.079 --> 18:16.787
after that, it was all asses and elbows.

18:17.936 --> 18:20.410
Okay, look, I'm sorry, Hyde.

18:20.488 --> 18:24.056
There's a lot of guys that Pam would choose before you and Red

18:24.265 --> 18:26.140
All right, it goes "me"

18:27.207 --> 18:28.718
then Bob

18:29.499 --> 18:30.697
Fez,

18:30.931 --> 18:32.468
then you...

18:33.623 --> 18:36.254
Red, then me again

18:37.217 --> 18:39.353
Then Donna, then Eric.

18:42.556 --> 18:45.082
Okay, Eric, there's something I need to know.

18:45.186 --> 18:48.806
Did you or did you not do it with the slurpee slut

18:48.910 --> 18:49.587
What?

18:49.665 --> 18:55.524
He answered a question with a question. That means he's guilty.
Now let's ditch him and carry me out of here.

18:56.540 --> 18:57.425
Donna,

18:57.686 --> 18:59.378
I did not sleep with her.

18:59.428 --> 19:02.374
Well, you lied to met about her before,
so why should I believe you

19:02.436 --> 19:04.188
you don't believe me?

19:04.248 --> 19:05.860
Fine.

19:05.941 --> 19:09.144
Let me show you what I was doing while you were with Casey.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.696
You're gonna hide in your bedroom and cry?

19:12.373 --> 19:15.134
Or you gonna try to write a song again?

19:15.577 --> 19:18.988
Hey guys, what rimes with "pain"?

19:19.509 --> 19:21.410
I loved that song

19:21.410 --> 19:26.671
Everyday is like rain when you're in pain.

19:26.671 --> 19:28.103
Ok, Donna

19:28.676 --> 19:32.139
This is is a box full of model
that I made while you were with Casey kelso.

19:32.218 --> 19:36.645
Look at this: Tie Fighters, assault vehicules and troop transports

19:36.983 --> 19:41.565
all with minor defects in workmanship.
Ye he made these, all right.

19:42.634 --> 19:44.848
So this is what you did when we were apart?

19:45.368 --> 19:48.155
Oh my horny nerd boy

19:51.618 --> 19:54.900
Donna, there's a reason I didn't tell you about her.

19:55.264 --> 19:56.931
She wasn't important.

19:57.374 --> 19:59.718
The whole time we broke up.. you know...

20:01.463 --> 20:03.520
You know I never stopped loving you.

20:05.108 --> 20:06.384
Eric.

20:08.963 --> 20:09.744
Hyde,

20:11.098 --> 20:13.345
I never stopped loving you, either.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.093
Don't.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.905
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

20:23.494 --> 20:26.358
You guys better be kidding,
or I'm gonna be super pissed.

20:32.809 --> 20:33.955
So

20:34.137 --> 20:35.882
can I suggest that

20:36.272 --> 20:41.923
we honor the age-old tradition of making up
after a fight, not just spiritually,

20:44.824 --> 20:46.360
but physically?

20:47.558 --> 20:51.308
How about a brand-spanking-new tradition
where I buy you a milkshake and a "playboy"?

20:51.412 --> 20:54.746
Donna, whoa. I'm insulted.

20:55.006 --> 20:58.444
I do not need a milkshake. Let's go.

21:00.516 --> 21:04.292
So they're back together and everything's fine?

21:04.422 --> 21:05.776
That sucks.

21:05.881 --> 21:08.120
See what happens when you specialize?

21:11.948 --> 21:15.464
I can go and make any number of ladies uncomfortable.

21:16.869 --> 21:18.328
What can you do?

21:25.458 --> 21:28.244
What do you think he meant
by, "Whoopsy doozy"?

21:28.973 --> 21:30.978
Not here. Toyota!

21:33.478 --> 21:35.744
Oh, I'm so freaked out,
Mrs. Forman.

21:35.822 --> 21:37.879
I'm gonna have to sleep
with the light on.

21:41.890 --> 21:43.843
What are you two
doing out here?

21:45.050 --> 21:47.211
We--we were just...

21:48.695 --> 21:49.659
uh-oh!

21:50.305 --> 21:56.929
