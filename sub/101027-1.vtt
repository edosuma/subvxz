00:37.625 --> 00:40.833
How are you feeling
on a scale of one to ten?

00:44.833 --> 00:46.166
Can I be less than one?

00:46.666 --> 00:48.666
There's nothing
lower than one.

00:49.791 --> 00:51.458
There's zero.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.791
Your parents
tell me you were born

00:54.958 --> 00:57.500
with a unique condition.

00:59.750 --> 01:03.291
I accidentally,
I accidentally kill people.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.083
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

01:09.166 --> 01:14.166
When people see me,
the-- my face, they...

01:20.958 --> 01:23.833
You accidentally assault
people with your face?

01:28.708 --> 01:33.666
Let's pretend that what you're
projecting is, in fact, real,

01:34.291 --> 01:36.125
why are your parents
still alive?

01:36.541 --> 01:38.750
I think they must've
seen your face.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.791
Well... my mom says

01:42.958 --> 01:45.458
-she knew something was
wrong the day I was born.
- One more push.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.041
- One more push, honey.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.375
- You're so close.
- Yes.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.000
-It's a boy.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.833
He's the most beautiful
baby I've ever seen.

02:00.875 --> 02:04.125
We moved out
of the city when I was two

02:04.291 --> 02:08.208
to some place more secluded.

02:08.375 --> 02:12.625
The fewer the people,
the less accidents.

02:12.791 --> 02:17.875
It was a fresh start,
my chance at a normal life.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.333
That was wishful thinking.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.250
Because I couldn't have felt any more... different.

02:25.708 --> 02:28.708
I understand your desire
to dwell in the past.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.916
What really brought
you here today?

02:34.166 --> 02:35.458
I just want to be normal.

02:38.541 --> 02:41.625
Have you ever considered
that your wrappings

02:42.708 --> 02:45.333
could simply be your mind's

02:45.500 --> 02:49.916
physical manifestation
of depression?

03:01.583 --> 03:02.458
Oh, my God.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.875
I, I tried to tell him.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.125
Damn it, Max.

03:11.916 --> 03:13.666
-Look, we know
all these heart attacks

03:13.833 --> 03:15.916
ain't his fault,
but it just doesn't sit right

03:16.083 --> 03:18.000
that every time someone
croaks in this town,

03:18.166 --> 03:20.958
we get a call and,
boom, there's your boy.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.625
-Yeah, it's strange.
Just strange.
-It is weird.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.583
It just looks
bad on the whole force

03:27.750 --> 03:29.916
that we keep letting
him off with a warning.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.833
Folks are dying,
and all we can say is,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.458
"Well, you know, shit happens."

03:36.250 --> 03:38.458
-No, we, we completely
understand.
-We understand.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.000
So, uh...

03:55.541 --> 04:00.458
Did, did, uh, Dr. Clingaman
say anything helpful?

04:02.833 --> 04:03.833
No, Dad.

04:04.916 --> 04:06.083
He died.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.791
I'm sorry our house
is a freezer, Dan.

04:14.958 --> 04:16.583
The heater's still waiting
for Paul to fix it.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.875
Uh, I don't mind a little
cold, Mrs. Richardson.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.958
Yeah, well neither does Paul.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.750
-Oh, hello there, Alana Skovia.

04:25.916 --> 04:28.083
What is that then, new country?

04:28.250 --> 04:33.166
Alana Skovia is a type of babe,
and she's from the Ukraine.

04:33.583 --> 04:37.625
Hmm, Paul, didn't you
have something to say?

04:38.333 --> 04:39.875
Your dad has something
he wanted to say.

04:40.458 --> 04:43.791
Max, your mother is worried
that you spend too much--

04:43.958 --> 04:45.000
Wait a minute, excuse me, whoa.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.666
-Well.
-We, okay.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.541
We are worried you spend
too much time at home.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.166
Yes, honey,
I think Dan would agree

04:52.333 --> 04:54.125
that you're not going
to meet anyone your own age

04:54.291 --> 04:55.208
locked away in your room.

04:56.083 --> 04:57.625
Wait a sec. What if Max

04:57.791 --> 05:00.041
signed up with one
of those dating services,

05:00.208 --> 05:01.708
you know, like, like,
Dan on the, uh,

05:01.875 --> 05:02.916
you know, on the cell phone?

05:03.083 --> 05:06.958
Oh, there's an idea. Paul!

05:07.416 --> 05:09.000
That's a great idea
because all the girls

05:09.166 --> 05:11.041
are going to want
to swipe right on this, huh?

05:11.208 --> 05:12.791
I look like a freaking
burn victim had sex

05:12.958 --> 05:14.208
with a serial killer, guys.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.125
Max, can you please
not use graphic

05:16.291 --> 05:17.541
comparisons at the table?

05:17.708 --> 05:19.125
-That's a rule?
- Yes, it is.

05:19.291 --> 05:20.666
-Yes.
-It's a rule now.

05:20.833 --> 05:21.666
It is, it's a rule.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.041
What's with the brick?

05:28.166 --> 05:29.041
-No.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.291
Come on.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.416
You said last time
was the last time.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.750
That was a hammer, this is
a brick, it's different.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.541
-You need to see a therapist.
-I did, he's dead.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.791
This is your problem, man.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.791
You lock yourself up
in here like a grandma,

05:41.958 --> 05:43.416
sewing all this--

05:44.958 --> 05:47.125
-is that bunny
sucking his own dick?
-What?

05:49.083 --> 05:50.958
That's a carrot,
he's eating a carrot.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.708
Looks like a dick, man.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.791
Jeez, you just don't get it.

05:54.958 --> 05:56.958
You know how thirsty
the girls are right now?

05:57.125 --> 05:58.666
Was there a drought?

05:59.041 --> 06:01.583
- It's Valentine's
Day, dude.
- Oh.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.875
It's the easiest day
of the year to score a date.

06:04.041 --> 06:06.250
All the single ladies
are on a survival mission

06:06.416 --> 06:08.041
to score a Facebook brag post,

06:08.208 --> 06:09.500
and you get to be the guy
that makes it happen.

06:09.666 --> 06:10.791
-Come on.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.375
Hey.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.250
Yeah.

06:21.416 --> 06:22.458
Stop.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.500
It's a horrible monster.

06:32.666 --> 06:34.833
It's evil because
it's different.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.958
It's strange!

06:38.541 --> 06:39.541
Oh.

06:40.958 --> 06:43.583
The Foreign Exchange Program's
looking for host families.

06:43.750 --> 06:44.791
That could be nice.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.875
Get you a little foreign friend?

06:48.291 --> 06:52.041
Mom, they're, they're
foreign exchange students.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.000
They're not pets.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.291
They're foreign,
and they want to come here.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.583
-Okay.

07:06.708 --> 07:08.333
Max, go get a magazine.

07:12.541 --> 07:13.416
Go!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.208
Can I help you?

07:23.041 --> 07:24.708
Uh, I was just--

07:24.875 --> 07:27.083
Oh, this isn't going
to fix your problem.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.500
-Okay.
-Sorry.

07:32.666 --> 07:36.125
Stop, stop,
stop, stop!

07:46.625 --> 07:48.208
- What is that?
-It's a magazine.

07:48.375 --> 07:51.125
No, this is garbage,
take this, you take this.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.125
Look, foreign exchange.

07:58.708 --> 08:01.333
I haven't, I haven't seen anyone
play that game in a long time.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.916
Oh, oh, I didn't catch
150 Pokémon to abandon them.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.583
150, that, that's a lot,
that's a lot of Pokémon.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.708
-Um.
-I, I fell.

08:16.541 --> 08:17.458
You fell?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.041
-On a brick.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.041
I hate when that happens.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.500
Max Richardson.

08:29.541 --> 08:30.708
Okay.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.500
I can't,

08:43.666 --> 08:45.125
it's too cold to fold.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.583
-Just call someone.

08:49.041 --> 08:51.125
Your father said he would
fix the heater two weeks ago.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.541
No one should have
to live in these conditions.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.625
-That's not breakfast,
that's sugar.

08:57.791 --> 09:01.083
Hi, yes, I'm calling about
the heater in my living room.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.708
It stopped working a week ago.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.166
Oh, thank you, that's perfect.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.250
It's 411 New Beginnings.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.083
Oh, yes, he's my son.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.125
-Hello?

09:16.750 --> 09:18.125
Oh, my God, he hung up on me.

09:19.708 --> 09:20.583
It's Dan.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.916
Hey.

09:24.541 --> 09:28.666
Hi, so, uh, I didn't break
your nose or anything?

09:28.833 --> 09:33.416
No... I wish.

09:33.958 --> 09:36.250
I just have
a hyperactive immune system,

09:36.416 --> 09:37.958
I'm practically deformed.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.708
Okay, try not
to describe yourself

09:40.875 --> 09:42.541
as being deformed tonight.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.375
What's tonight?

09:45.666 --> 09:48.291
Dan, I, I hate you.

09:48.458 --> 09:49.916
You said you wanted
to meet girls,

09:50.083 --> 09:51.458
-I got you a Valentine's date.
-No, no,

09:51.625 --> 09:53.041
that's not what I said.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.750
I said I, I can't,
I can't meet girls.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.666
-Well, now you can.
-Oh, my God.

09:58.833 --> 09:59.750
What, what's going on?

09:59.916 --> 10:01.166
Oh, my God.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.125
Dude, stop stressing.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.125
-Oh, my God.
-It's going to be fine.

10:05.291 --> 10:06.333
You're going to kill it.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.625
-Shit.

10:09.791 --> 10:11.458
You know what I mean.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.416
So, I'm, like, really feeling
your cologne right now.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.750
Well,
it's compliments to this guy.

10:17.916 --> 10:21.625
It's, it's just,
it's just Arm & Hammer.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.083
Like the baking soda?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.791
You know, I don't normally
set people up,

10:27.958 --> 10:30.041
but, uh, I'm not going to lie,

10:30.625 --> 10:32.625
I think you and Max
will be pretty bomb together.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.625
Wait, what?

10:34.791 --> 10:36.583
Bonjour , lady and gentlemens.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.875
Happy Valentine's Day,
can I start any you off

10:40.041 --> 10:41.625
with a cold beverage tonight?

10:41.791 --> 10:42.583
You know what?

10:42.750 --> 10:44.375
I got these two.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.000
-Dan.
- Wait.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.541
What about
one of our milkshakes?

10:49.708 --> 10:50.750
I can't have that.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.500
- Milk?
-Calories.

10:52.875 --> 10:57.375
All right,
two diet sodas, extra ice.

10:57.541 --> 10:58.500
Thank you.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.166
So...  Erica...

11:07.458 --> 11:10.625
that's a really strong name.

11:10.791 --> 11:13.708
Um, is it, is it, uh, Filipino?

11:15.250 --> 11:16.250
I'm Cuban.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.000
Oh, I, I forgot,
I made you something.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.500
I hope this isn't weird,

11:23.666 --> 11:25.208
I, I don't really think
it's that weird.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.750
You made me a napkin?

11:27.916 --> 11:30.625
No, it, it looks
like a napkin, kind of, yeah.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.666
But, uh, it's actually
a handkerchief, and if you,

11:33.833 --> 11:35.833
if you cry,
you can use it to wipe,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.083
or if you need to blow
your nose, um,

11:38.250 --> 11:41.250
or all of the above, if, if
they're happening at the same,

11:41.416 --> 11:42.583
same kind of time and--

11:44.833 --> 11:45.708
Thanks.

11:48.125 --> 11:52.708
Look, um...
I, I know you didn't,

11:53.833 --> 11:55.500
you didn't have
to come here tonight.

11:56.041 --> 12:00.500
But you, you seem really nice,
and this is kind of,

12:00.666 --> 12:05.583
like, my first Valentine's
Day thing like this,

12:05.750 --> 12:06.750
so...

12:08.333 --> 12:09.291
thank you.

12:10.791 --> 12:12.416
- I'm making a scene?
- Yes.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.708
-You want me to make a scene?

12:13.875 --> 12:15.750
You're an asshole, Craig!

12:21.125 --> 12:22.250
Erica.

12:24.625 --> 12:25.791
What's hanging, sexy?

12:33.458 --> 12:34.708
Hold up.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.916
You're the kid that kills people
with his pretty face?

12:38.083 --> 12:39.416
Uh, no, that's--

12:40.125 --> 12:43.166
Oh, shit, you are.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.291
Uh.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.875
Come on, let me see.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.750
-Craig.
-Two diets and, um,

12:50.916 --> 12:54.125
my manager is
asking you to leave.

12:54.291 --> 12:56.583
-Your manager can suck my sack.
-Totally.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.208
-Uh.

13:00.375 --> 13:01.916
-What the hell, man?
-Sorry, sorry.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.541
-It's fine, it's fine.
-No, this ain't cool.

13:03.708 --> 13:04.583
Okay, yeah, I'll get,
I'll get someone.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.791
No.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.125
You did this.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.583
You clean it up.

13:10.958 --> 13:11.958
Craig.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.583
Okay, but with, with what?

13:15.125 --> 13:17.291
Start with whatever
this shit is.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.000
-Here, let me help you.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.416
-Oh, my God. Craig, stop it!

13:27.833 --> 13:29.833
Hey, I need you to go.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.500
I'm going, I'm going.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.625
I'm so sorry.
We're going to get
this cleaned up for you.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.333
Uh...

13:48.250 --> 13:50.750
do you, do you think
I could, I could--

13:52.000 --> 13:53.875
I could take you on
a date some other time?

13:56.750 --> 13:58.083
Uh...

13:59.458 --> 14:00.708
I, I can't.

14:01.416 --> 14:02.333
I, I'm sorry.

14:37.291 --> 14:38.625
What are you doing?

14:42.291 --> 14:43.250
I'm Alex.

14:43.791 --> 14:44.875
I remember, I'm just--

14:46.041 --> 14:47.875
Just kind of
in the middle of something.

14:48.041 --> 14:51.416
What, am I interrupting your
dramatic leap off the bridge?

14:54.583 --> 14:56.333
Bad things happen
because of me and--

14:58.291 --> 15:00.791
And they'd stop once
I'm gone, okay?

15:02.583 --> 15:03.625
That's pretty dark.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.416
Yeah, well, my life
is pretty dark.

15:06.916 --> 15:08.583
It could be the sunglasses.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.541
Jelly bean?

15:19.541 --> 15:21.208
But they only have
the gross flavors.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.791
Well, because I ate
all the good ones,

15:22.958 --> 15:24.666
and this is the shit
I was left with.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.000
Thanks, I'm good.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.291
Fair enough, you jump, you jump

15:32.458 --> 15:33.708
in the river
full of jelly beans.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.041
I had, I had a dream
once that...

15:38.666 --> 15:40.750
that I was swimming
in a pool full of jelly beans.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.500
Doesn't seem like
much of a drop.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.416
You should probably find
a higher bridge.

15:53.000 --> 15:53.958
What?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.083
You want to die, right?

15:57.791 --> 15:58.666
Yeah.

16:00.791 --> 16:02.500
Well, then you should
find a higher bridge.

16:03.791 --> 16:05.833
Wait, what? Wait, what?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.625
Are you, are you serious?

16:08.375 --> 16:09.791
Well, it's just physics.

16:10.875 --> 16:11.958
What did you want me to say?

16:12.125 --> 16:14.333
I don't, I don't know.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.375
Look...

16:18.250 --> 16:19.500
you're not going to jump.

16:20.250 --> 16:23.041
You're going to die an old man
warm on your bed, not here.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.708
-Not this night.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.208
"You jump, I jump," remember?

16:30.708 --> 16:32.250
Did you just quote Titanic?

16:33.333 --> 16:34.791
Well, my ride's here.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.833
- You're leaving?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.375
If you're going to end
your life forever,

16:38.583 --> 16:40.208
what's a couple
more hours with me?

16:48.833 --> 16:50.791
Let me see if
she's taking visitors today.

16:51.833 --> 16:54.833
Thank you, Myrtle,
nice to see you as always.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.541
What's with all the caps
and exclamation marks?

16:58.708 --> 17:00.291
Oh, it's just
a reminder of, like,

17:00.458 --> 17:01.708
how I like to live my life.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.250
Loud, vibrant, bold.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.375
Oh, okay.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.458
No, I'm, I'm here
more than the staff.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.000
So, it's just annoying
that they keep making me

17:13.166 --> 17:14.750
sign in so I'm annoying back.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.458
-You know, when you

17:19.625 --> 17:20.916
said you were going
to take me somewhere,

17:21.083 --> 17:22.666
I, I didn't really think

17:22.833 --> 17:24.791
you meant the retirement home.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.291
Well, I thought

17:27.458 --> 17:28.750
nothing would make you
appreciate life

17:28.916 --> 17:30.166
more than being
around a bunch of

17:30.333 --> 17:32.208
old people who are
about to croak.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.750
Hey.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.083
Hello.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.750
Alex, you usually
visit on Fridays.

17:43.916 --> 17:45.250
Oh, it is Friday, Esther.

17:45.416 --> 17:49.541
Oh, one of the upsides
to Alzheimer's,

17:49.708 --> 17:52.083
it's almost always the weekend.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.791
Hey, one of the many upsides.

17:53.958 --> 17:54.875
- Yeah.
-By the way, I brought you

17:55.041 --> 17:56.541
a present, this is Max.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.375
Oh, what happened to your face?

18:00.250 --> 18:02.708
I should have some vitamin D
ointment in my purse.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.583
-He doesn't need ointment.
- Oh, take the ointment.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.791
-Was it a burn?
-Max fell on a brick.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.416
- A brick?
-And today he almost
fell off of a bridge.

18:10.583 --> 18:13.000
Christ, boy,
are you drunk?

18:13.166 --> 18:15.625
No, he's depressed.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.958
Rosemary,
this boy thinks he's depressed.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.875
-Depressed?
- Yeah,

18:23.041 --> 18:24.875
wait until your bladder stops.

18:25.041 --> 18:27.208
And they put you on this pill
that they shove up your ass

18:27.375 --> 18:30.458
and then it gives you rashes
in places you didn't
even know you had.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.083
Then we can talk
about being depressed.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.041
Oh my, your face.

18:37.125 --> 18:40.375
Oh, good,
you have ointment. Ha-ha!

18:40.541 --> 18:43.083
I have written over 30 novels.

18:43.250 --> 18:46.500
I think I have an understanding
of the process.

18:46.958 --> 18:48.000
You wrote novels?

18:48.458 --> 18:50.250
Write novels, I'm not dead yet.

18:50.416 --> 18:51.791
Romance novels.

18:52.833 --> 18:54.125
Dirty ones.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.875
Oh, like Danielle Steel?
My mom loves her.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.333
Yeah, well, I went to college

18:58.500 --> 19:00.000
with that bitch,
and let me tell you,

19:00.166 --> 19:01.666
that ginger whore doesn't have

19:01.833 --> 19:03.833
one original thought
in her brain.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.291
Her last name is Steel
for Christ's sake.

19:06.458 --> 19:08.333
She stole my shit!

19:08.500 --> 19:10.916
Tell them what
you're writing now.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.875
I think it's fabulous.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.208
Well, it's my last
novel. Not so much a memoir,

19:15.375 --> 19:18.333
a personal walk
with Alzheimer's,

19:18.500 --> 19:21.000
my descent into the disease.

19:21.166 --> 19:25.541
I feel at my age,
all I have left is my mind.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.083
If I lose that,
what else is there?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.666
Son of a bitch, here she goes.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.916
Not everyone has the ability
to face the unknown

19:34.083 --> 19:35.458
with such courage, Esther.

19:36.083 --> 19:40.041
I told you before, I think your
book's going to change lives.

19:40.208 --> 19:43.208
I suppose, I mean, there
really isn't anything like it.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.250
Except for maybe that one movie.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.750
What movie?

19:47.333 --> 19:49.958
Uh, you know, the one where
the woman can't remember,

19:50.125 --> 19:52.166
-and he comes every day.
-The Notebook?

19:52.333 --> 19:55.958
Yes, it's maybe
a lot like that one.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.875
You didn't, you didn't have
to walk me all the way home.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.833
Oh, I just wanted to make sure

20:11.000 --> 20:13.541
you're home wasn't the bridge.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.375
You're home, cool.

20:18.541 --> 20:19.750
-Yeah.
-Have a good night.

20:20.833 --> 20:21.916
Do you--

20:24.041 --> 20:25.541
Um...

20:26.375 --> 20:30.000
what are,
what are you doing tomorrow?

20:32.416 --> 20:33.333
Tomorrow?

20:33.958 --> 20:34.875
Yeah.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.541
Oh.

20:40.791 --> 20:41.666
I can't.

20:43.708 --> 20:44.875
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

20:45.041 --> 20:45.958
No, that's--

20:47.375 --> 20:48.666
Uh...

20:50.291 --> 20:52.500
I just-- it's not you.

20:52.916 --> 20:54.208
Today was really fun.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.333
Um, I just-- I wasn't really...

20:59.166 --> 21:00.875
-planning this.
-Yeah, okay.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.583
Okay.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.166
Sorry.

21:07.875 --> 21:08.791
Have a good night.

21:14.041 --> 21:15.250
You lose.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.625
Did you at least
get her last name?

21:20.291 --> 21:21.708
Why would I ask her that?

21:21.875 --> 21:23.166
Dude, you always ask
for the last name

21:23.333 --> 21:24.666
so you can creep her
on social media.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.375
-Ugh.
-Was she hot?

21:27.750 --> 21:30.125
-Uh, I don't know.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.875
I'm not buying it.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.833
-No, no,
no, no, no, no, no!
- Ha!

21:37.000 --> 21:38.125
I'm over this.

21:40.708 --> 21:43.750
You know, you could try
retracing your steps.

21:44.291 --> 21:45.416
Try and bump into her again.

21:47.416 --> 21:50.875
Oh, see, a little bit
of ass, I told you.

22:35.375 --> 22:38.041
Uh, hey, you, you just,
you just missed your bus.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.458
-Are you stalking me?
- What?

22:40.625 --> 22:41.875
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm--

22:42.041 --> 22:43.458
So what, what are
you doing here?

22:46.791 --> 22:48.541
I was, I was--

22:49.083 --> 22:50.458
Maybe I'm stalking you.

22:51.375 --> 22:52.708
You didn't know I was
going to be here.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.125
Really? Because I'm pretty sure

22:54.291 --> 22:55.791
I'm here and so are you.

23:00.916 --> 23:03.083
I think the fact that I can't
see your confused face

23:03.250 --> 23:05.083
makes me want to screw
with you more.

23:10.083 --> 23:13.083
Are you sure you don't
want to hang with me again?

23:13.708 --> 23:14.750
Don't you have school?

23:15.291 --> 23:17.083
I'm, I'm, I'm home-schooled.

23:17.250 --> 23:19.708
That's still school,
it's literally in the name.

23:20.125 --> 23:24.333
It's, it's, it's called an
independent, independent study.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.958
Hey, if you're
already skipping...

23:33.541 --> 23:36.416
why not just spend
a couple more hours with me?

23:49.625 --> 23:51.583
-Yes.
-Yes?

23:52.125 --> 23:53.541
Start walking
before I start saying no.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.000
Okay.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.041
Can I interest you two
in a free RPG starter pack?

24:06.833 --> 24:08.625
How many goblins
are in this game?

24:08.791 --> 24:12.375
Hundreds, and there's like
goblin hordes and clans and--

24:12.541 --> 24:13.916
But there's only one wench?

24:14.083 --> 24:17.250
Eleanor the Savage Queen of Man.

24:17.416 --> 24:20.750
What are those goblins
doing to Eleanor the Savage?

24:21.291 --> 24:24.583
Well, they are, um,
ravaging her dungeon.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.500
This is not enough. Excuse me?

24:35.291 --> 24:37.166
Hi, do you have
any more in the back?

24:53.333 --> 24:54.875
Jelly beans are supposed
to feel like jelly

24:55.041 --> 24:56.333
not like gravel.

24:58.375 --> 25:00.458
My dream would have been
much more comfortable.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.291
What was your dream?

25:02.458 --> 25:04.541
Um, a river full of Jell-O.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.750
-What flavor?
-Celery.

25:08.750 --> 25:10.750
That's, that's not a real thing.

25:10.916 --> 25:12.541
Um, it is 100% a real thing,

25:12.708 --> 25:14.291
housewives in the 1960s used it

25:14.458 --> 25:15.791
to rebel against their husbands.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.541
Alex, I have
to tell you something.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.583
I was born with a face and--

25:27.750 --> 25:30.500
Ooh, you were born with a face.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.833
God.

25:37.333 --> 25:40.000
My face is lethally attractive.

25:42.166 --> 25:46.125
So, when people see it,
when they see my face, they--

25:46.291 --> 25:47.375
Die?

25:59.791 --> 26:00.750
Okay.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.916
-Okay?
-I mean, not okay, but...

26:06.250 --> 26:07.375
it's old news.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.041
You already knew?

26:10.791 --> 26:13.000
Besides, you're kind of
a big hit at the hospital.

26:15.666 --> 26:16.625
Wait...

26:18.333 --> 26:20.916
what are you doing
hanging around the hospital?

26:27.291 --> 26:29.541
I have a rare
cardiovascular disease.

26:31.708 --> 26:32.958
What's wrong with your heart?

26:33.500 --> 26:36.958
I'm allergic
to endorphins.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.583
Excitement causes inflammation,

26:39.750 --> 26:42.625
which causes my heart to grow.

26:46.125 --> 26:49.208
This monitors heart
rate and heart size.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.750
So any emotion,
good or bad, my body rejects.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.791
It's okay though because they
put me on this trial medication,

26:56.958 --> 26:59.041
and I got really lucky
because it works.

26:59.208 --> 27:02.791
So, now my heart is basically
on Weight Watchers.

27:04.875 --> 27:05.916
So, you're fine?

27:06.708 --> 27:08.583
Well, if you consider
taking a pill every day

27:08.750 --> 27:11.458
and wearing a robotic
bra fine, then, yes.

27:12.375 --> 27:14.583
My heart is not currently
a ticking time bomb.

27:20.166 --> 27:22.291
Have you ever thought about
if your life were a movie,

27:22.458 --> 27:24.458
what song they would
use in the montage?

27:25.166 --> 27:27.250
Mm... no.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.708
Do, do most people
think about that kind of stuff?

27:31.375 --> 27:34.000
Yes, everyone, except you.

27:39.666 --> 27:41.416
This is for one of those moments

27:41.583 --> 27:45.041
where your life
derails you, and your head

27:45.208 --> 27:47.166
and your heart can't keep up.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.333
Everything plays out
like a blur.

27:52.208 --> 27:55.375
And all you hear is this.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.625
This movie theater hasn't gotten
a new movie in five years,

28:13.791 --> 28:15.416
but this will make it
feel like new.

28:22.458 --> 28:25.250
-Is this wine?
-Yes, the vodka kind.

28:25.708 --> 28:28.416
-It tastes like nail polish.
-That's how you know
it's effective.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.708
How do you know what
nail polish tastes like?

28:33.041 --> 28:34.166
Thanks.

28:41.666 --> 28:45.083
I don't think I can
finish this whole bottle.

28:45.250 --> 28:48.000
Don't you dare ruin this for me.
I've wanted to do
this for so long.

28:48.791 --> 28:50.250
- Why?
-Because I could never do

28:50.416 --> 28:52.250
anything fun,
because I was always sick.

28:53.333 --> 28:55.541
Besides, I didn't
really have any friends.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.083
You're my first friend.

29:07.791 --> 29:09.250
Do you want
to play a drinking game?

29:09.833 --> 29:11.500
-How, we've never
seen this movie?
-Yes, it's like

29:11.666 --> 29:13.333
the Any Movie Drinking Game.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.750
-The Any Movie Drinking Game?
- Yes, go!

29:15.916 --> 29:18.458
Okay, okay, okay, uh,
if you see a title card, drink.

29:18.625 --> 29:19.541
-Go.
-Okay.

29:21.541 --> 29:22.958
Next.

29:23.125 --> 29:24.583
Oh, okay.
Oh, if there's a flashback.

29:24.750 --> 29:26.250
Yes!

29:27.083 --> 29:28.500
Any time an actor talks.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.458
Any time it says,
"From the producers of,"

29:30.625 --> 29:32.250
Any time someone wakes up, go!

29:34.416 --> 29:35.833
-Eugh!

29:36.000 --> 29:38.291
Planets! Excessive
armpit hair. Cheers!

29:39.875 --> 29:41.750
-Gosh, it's really hot.

29:41.916 --> 29:43.291
-Are you hot?
-No.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.166
I'm, like, boiling
in here.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.708
-Why is it sticky here, too?

29:47.875 --> 29:50.500
-Can you feel your teeth?
-Yes.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.541
-Are they there?
-Is this your
first time drinking?

30:03.416 --> 30:05.125
-Buddy, you need to drink this.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.041
-What, all of it?
-Yeah, all of it.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.500
Oh, I can't.

30:08.666 --> 30:09.750
- You can.
-I'm going to drown.

30:11.458 --> 30:12.500
-Oh!

30:14.958 --> 30:15.833
Oops.

30:19.333 --> 30:20.208
Hey!

30:20.750 --> 30:22.416
Dude, why aren't we hanging out?

30:22.583 --> 30:24.250
-This is stupid, come over.
-Hi.

30:24.416 --> 30:28.916
Oh, shit, um, you two just
get back to whatever it is

30:29.083 --> 30:31.458
that you were doing, and Max?

30:31.625 --> 30:32.958
Yeah.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.708
-You're my boy.
-Oh.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.416
Who was that?

30:36.833 --> 30:37.875
Dan.

30:38.041 --> 30:38.916
Dan.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.375
What was that?

30:41.541 --> 30:43.500
Oh, this is the tiny
light of death,

30:43.958 --> 30:45.208
pray it never blinks.

30:50.541 --> 30:52.166
-Max?
-Hmm.

30:53.791 --> 30:56.166
I want you to stitch me
like one of your French girls.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.375
Okay, Rose.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.458
I can feel you staring at me.

31:07.625 --> 31:11.333
You can't see
if I'm staring at you.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.958
I can't see what you're
doing.

31:47.791 --> 31:48.833
Hi.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.125
Max!

31:54.500 --> 31:55.458
Uh.

31:59.666 --> 32:01.291
Max, I--

32:03.583 --> 32:04.666
Oh, wow.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.625
-A girl.
-Oh, God. Please kill me.

32:09.791 --> 32:11.625
Hi, I'm Alex.

32:18.166 --> 32:19.750
-Whoa, whoa.
- Oh.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.416
-Sorry, I'm a hugger.
-What, since when?

32:22.583 --> 32:23.916
-No, you're not!

32:24.583 --> 32:26.958
I'm, uh-- I, uh-- I'm a shaker.

32:27.125 --> 32:28.208
- Hi.
-Hi.

32:29.458 --> 32:30.416
Dad.

32:32.375 --> 32:33.875
Oh, come on in.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.166
This is Yu Shen.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.833
She's from the exchange program.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.666
Yu Shen,
welcome to your new home.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.750
You're so cute, isn't she cute?

32:50.250 --> 32:51.875
-Yes.

32:54.416 --> 32:56.625
-Oh!

33:01.208 --> 33:02.333
She's a little jet-lagged.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.125
Damn it.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.708
You take two steps forward
and the next thing you know,

33:09.875 --> 33:11.458
you're face down
in the shitter wondering

33:11.625 --> 33:12.916
how the hell you got there.

33:15.166 --> 33:18.166
Hey, why is Rosemary
sitting all by herself?

33:18.333 --> 33:21.375
She's waiting
for her son to take her
to get pie for her birthday.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.833
She says he comes every year,
but I've never seen it.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.166
It's her birthday?

33:25.333 --> 33:27.208
82, but I didn't tell you.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.833
She wants everybody
to think she's 88.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.041
-Why?
-Well, when you're young,
you lie about your age

33:33.208 --> 33:35.708
because you can't accept the
fact that you're getting old.

33:35.875 --> 33:38.250
But when you crack 70,
all you want is for people

33:38.416 --> 33:40.791
to tell you,
"You don't look your age."

33:42.458 --> 33:44.333
The pie is not
going anywhere, Ro.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.250
Get your sweet ass in here!

33:46.416 --> 33:48.500
Could you stop screaming at me?

33:49.500 --> 33:51.833
She's always on me about my ass.

33:52.791 --> 33:55.083
Oh, I love this game.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.250
Happy Birthday, Rose.

33:57.416 --> 33:59.875
88 years, can you believe it?

34:00.041 --> 34:02.916
88, you barely
look a day over 82.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.250
You told him.

34:05.416 --> 34:06.958
Let the boy give you
a compliment.

34:07.125 --> 34:10.583
Thank you, I have
a lot to be thankful for.

34:10.750 --> 34:13.458
My health, my friends.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.750
I honestly don't know
what I'd do without you.

34:15.916 --> 34:18.291
Well, you would carry on
like the rest of us.

34:18.458 --> 34:21.291
I told you,
I'm not strong like you, Esther.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.166
If I knew what was coming,

34:23.333 --> 34:25.333
I don't know if could put
myself through it.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.000
It's not strength, Ro.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.416
We didn't sign up just
for the good parts.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.833
The good comes
with the bad, that's living.

34:37.208 --> 34:41.083
Oh, shit,
I hate this goddamn game!

34:41.250 --> 34:42.333
My turn!

34:44.125 --> 34:45.416
And that is the secret

34:45.583 --> 34:46.958
to American cuisine.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.500
-Craft.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.375
Max, did your goblin
starter kit come

34:53.541 --> 34:55.333
with an oraculum gem?

34:57.208 --> 34:58.916
I have no idea what that means.

35:00.125 --> 35:02.791
Yu Shen, what does
your mom make for dinner?

35:03.833 --> 35:05.541
Maybe I could try
to something ethnic.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.791
-Uh, you got to pay for these.
- Sorry about that.

35:16.958 --> 35:19.500
Sorry, here you go.
This is for you.

35:19.666 --> 35:20.875
Thank you so much, sorry again.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.000
Have a good night.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.666
-Tomorrow, you're taking her.
-What?

35:24.833 --> 35:27.250
No, she, she, she doesn't
want to be here.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.791
Max, Yu Shen's family
is very well off, okay?

35:29.958 --> 35:31.291
-This is an adjustment for her.
-So what?

35:31.458 --> 35:32.958
Can you please
show a little sympathy?

35:33.125 --> 35:34.250
I'm-- so, I--
you want me to feel

35:34.416 --> 35:35.875
bad for her because she's rich?

35:36.041 --> 35:37.875
No, would it
hurt you at all to try

35:38.041 --> 35:39.375
and help her get acclimated?

35:39.541 --> 35:40.750
I have plans tomorrow!

35:41.208 --> 35:44.125
Max, I'm asking you
to be a friend.

35:44.916 --> 35:49.583
Mom, I'm supposed to go
camping with Alex and Dan.

35:50.083 --> 35:53.666
Then you, Alex, Dan and Yu Shen

35:53.833 --> 35:55.208
will have a great day tomorrow.

35:55.375 --> 35:56.666
This is a dictatorship.

35:56.833 --> 35:58.333
Well, no one said it
was a democracy.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.875
Oh, real American, Jan.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.625
-Oh, you're calling me Jan now?
- Yeah, you look

36:02.791 --> 36:04.083
like a Jan to me.

36:04.833 --> 36:05.708
Okay.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.333
Thanks, thanks, Paul.
Thanks for your help!

36:10.500 --> 36:12.666
-How am I missing Grishnakh.
-And for listening!

36:12.833 --> 36:15.208
-Honey, could you move
my character kit?
-What?

36:15.583 --> 36:17.791
-Grishnakh. He's a level
three key master.
-What?

36:17.958 --> 36:19.708
He, he's, he's,
he's the only goblin

36:19.875 --> 36:21.416
who can penetrate
Eleanor's secret vault.

36:21.583 --> 36:22.666
I'm lost without him.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.375
It was right here
in this front drawer.

36:27.000 --> 36:27.916
What is this game?

36:37.125 --> 36:38.125
Yu Shen!

36:47.375 --> 36:50.750
I hate to burst your bubble,
but it's way too flimsy.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.625
Uh, don't act like
you know what I'm doing.

36:54.166 --> 36:56.666
Well, it looks like
you're making a walking stick.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.875
That's funny because
I'm making a...

37:00.791 --> 37:03.708
...wand to close the portal.

37:04.041 --> 37:05.166
What portal?

37:05.708 --> 37:07.416
One to the alternate
dimension Dan's dates

37:07.583 --> 37:09.375
-keep crawling out of.

37:09.583 --> 37:12.791
I don't know, maybe Tiffany's
exceptionally warm-blooded.

37:13.250 --> 37:16.416
-Like a human polar bear.
-Please, have more respect

37:16.583 --> 37:18.041
for the polar bears.

37:18.375 --> 37:21.208
Can you get a picture
of us against this wall?

37:22.250 --> 37:23.625
That's a tree.

37:24.833 --> 37:25.833
Aren't you freezing?

37:26.000 --> 37:27.625
No, it's fur.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.041
-Oh.
- It's nice.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.041
Christ.

37:31.833 --> 37:35.000
Oh, shit, girl,
you're bleeding.

37:35.583 --> 37:36.750
I just-- oh.

37:36.916 --> 37:38.250
Oh, here, uh,

37:38.416 --> 37:40.125
I've got, uh--
here, give me your hand.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.708
No, that stings, I don't
really want you to do that.

37:43.041 --> 37:44.875
-Muffin tits.
-What, muffin ti--

37:47.625 --> 37:49.583
- Give me one second.

37:51.083 --> 37:54.166
Oh, it looks like we have
a Boy Scout on our hands.

38:04.541 --> 38:05.666
How's that feel?

38:08.125 --> 38:11.000
Fine, thank you.

38:30.625 --> 38:33.833
I know he's your friend,
but that's got to get old.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.541
I don't know, I...

38:38.958 --> 38:40.291
I accepted a long time ago

38:40.458 --> 38:41.875
that Dan has...

38:43.625 --> 38:44.500
what I don't.

38:45.083 --> 38:46.250
Oh, come on.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.500
You're not exactly wearing
that 'cause you're ugly.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.541
It would be nice to know what
you looked like under there.

38:59.666 --> 39:00.916
It's just a face.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.291
What are you doing?

39:22.333 --> 39:24.416
Close your eyes
and don't open them

39:24.583 --> 39:26.083
until I tell you to, okay?

39:27.500 --> 39:29.208
Okay, Mr. Serious.

39:29.625 --> 39:30.833
I am being serious.

39:54.041 --> 39:55.833
I wish you could see my face.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.750
You really know how to make
a girl feel like Helen Keller.

40:07.125 --> 40:09.000
- Max?
-Yeah.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.375
Have you ever been kissed?

40:12.625 --> 40:13.708
Almost...

40:16.791 --> 40:17.916
once.

40:19.833 --> 40:23.125
I was in the first grade
and I met this girl,

40:24.083 --> 40:29.416
and we decided that we would
be each other's first kiss.

40:30.750 --> 40:33.333
So, I told her
to close her eyes.

40:35.083 --> 40:40.250
But first graders, they just
don't listen very well.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.041
I'm not going to make
the same mistake as that girl.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.000
Technically, it'd be hard
because you're blind.

41:11.458 --> 41:13.500
-No, no!
- Nice.

41:13.666 --> 41:18.333
Every time.
Here. Have fun losing.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.166
Wait, does she even
know how to play it?

41:20.666 --> 41:23.291
-Oh, damn, she's good.

41:23.458 --> 41:24.625
How are you so good at this?

41:27.958 --> 41:29.916
-What?

41:32.375 --> 41:34.500
Hey, are you on your way?

41:34.666 --> 41:37.958
Oh, um, my mom just declared
a mandatory spring cleaning,

41:38.125 --> 41:40.416
so I'm kind of
a prisoner at the moment.

41:40.958 --> 41:43.041
Spring? It's freezing outside.

41:43.208 --> 41:46.416
I know, she doesn't
understand the seasons,
so we must all suffer.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.500
Oh, God, I didn't even know
you could do that!

41:51.041 --> 41:52.000
Hold on one second.

41:54.666 --> 41:56.750
What, what, what did she say?

41:57.208 --> 41:59.875
- I'm sorry,
there's weirdness happening.

42:00.041 --> 42:02.291
Just text if you want
to hang out later, okay?

42:02.458 --> 42:04.541
Yeah, I'll talk
to you later, bye.

42:07.875 --> 42:10.125
- Paging Dr. Ross,

42:10.291 --> 42:12.333
please, report
to emergency immediately.

42:18.583 --> 42:22.166
We don't let her
do anything that
would cause her heart to grow?

42:22.333 --> 42:24.458
Dr. Kravitz,
you are needed here in--

42:25.000 --> 42:26.500
Max, can you pause the game?
I need help real quick

42:26.666 --> 42:27.958
-with something small.
-Sure, Mrs. Richardson.

42:28.125 --> 42:30.041
Ah-ah. This request isn't

42:30.208 --> 42:31.708
either going to be
small nor quick.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.041
I need you to take out
the Christmas tree.

42:34.375 --> 42:35.791
-Told you.

42:35.958 --> 42:37.208
This tree is a bitch!

42:37.375 --> 42:38.333
You know what? Shut up.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.708
You did this.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.791
- Shit,
hold on, hold on.
- Okay.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.125
I think I got
a splinter.

42:46.291 --> 42:47.833
Okay, well, come on,
let's go upstairs.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.458
I think my mom's
got some tweezers.

42:49.625 --> 42:52.458
- It hurts.
- Just stop crying.

42:52.625 --> 42:54.541
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

42:54.708 --> 42:56.333
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

42:56.500 --> 42:58.708
- -♪ Oh, what fun is it to ride ♪

42:58.875 --> 43:01.000
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪

43:01.166 --> 43:05.291
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way ♪

43:05.458 --> 43:09.791
♪ Oh, what fun is it to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪

43:13.458 --> 43:15.208
Whoa, what? Yu Shen!

43:15.375 --> 43:17.291
Don't-- you're going
to burn the house down!

43:17.458 --> 43:18.916
- Whoa, Mom, Mom!
- Get some water, quick!

43:24.041 --> 43:25.791
All right, all set.
So, you're going to change out

43:25.958 --> 43:27.458
the dressing in two
to three days.

43:27.625 --> 43:28.666
I'm prescribing you
an antibiotic ointment,

43:28.833 --> 43:30.083
so you can put it on every day.

43:31.416 --> 43:32.583
Do you have any questions?

43:33.208 --> 43:34.833
-What are you doing later?
-You can take any

43:35.000 --> 43:36.791
over-the-counter pain
medication. Just make sure

43:36.958 --> 43:38.666
you're taking the proper dosage.
And if the pain or swelling

43:38.833 --> 43:40.333
increases,
you come in immediately.

43:40.833 --> 43:42.458
Otherwise,
I'll see you in seven days.

43:42.625 --> 43:44.125
Wait, I get to see you again?

43:44.291 --> 43:45.708
For your follow-up, yes.

43:47.250 --> 43:48.291
Damn.

43:50.791 --> 43:52.791
You know, she really
doesn't seem like your type.

43:52.958 --> 43:54.750
Yeah, what do you know
about my type.

43:54.916 --> 43:57.250
Hmm, brainless.

44:02.583 --> 44:04.291
This is good gauze,
she gave you the good stuff.

44:04.458 --> 44:05.833
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

44:07.166 --> 44:09.250
-Twinsies.

44:09.416 --> 44:11.500
-You didn't even get
her number or anything, so.
-Dude.

44:11.666 --> 44:13.583
I don't understand,
why didn't you tell me?

44:13.750 --> 44:15.291
Mom, because I knew
you'd freak out.

44:15.458 --> 44:16.375
Hey, Alex!

44:17.791 --> 44:18.833
Hey.

44:21.375 --> 44:22.625
Um...

44:22.791 --> 44:24.416
Uh, Christmas tree attack.

44:24.958 --> 44:26.708
That's funny, uh,

44:27.208 --> 44:29.083
I'm Dan, this is Max.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.291
They work with me at the home.

44:35.833 --> 44:37.958
Then you must spend
an awful lot of time together.

44:38.125 --> 44:40.875
No, no, we work
different shifts. Don't worry.

44:41.416 --> 44:45.333
It's okay. Okay, well, it was
good to see you, feel better.

44:50.250 --> 44:52.250
Dude, what the hell?

44:55.166 --> 44:56.166
Let's get out of here.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.958
The forum online
said they only manufactured

45:14.125 --> 45:15.750
10,000 units of Gremlin.

45:17.750 --> 45:21.416
And he supposedly comes
with detachable goblin armor.

45:22.541 --> 45:23.791
Which you should be
able to hear.

45:32.833 --> 45:36.791
Hey, Dad, when you and Mom met,

45:36.958 --> 45:39.625
how did you guys know
that you liked each other?

45:52.500 --> 45:53.958
I took your mother to dinner.

45:54.750 --> 45:58.041
I think it was...
our second date.

45:58.916 --> 46:00.500
We were walking
to the car and she said,

46:00.666 --> 46:02.333
"Paul, you love me, okay?"

46:04.125 --> 46:05.291
And, and that's how I knew.

46:06.250 --> 46:09.125
You might think it's blatantly
obvious that you like Alex,

46:09.291 --> 46:10.916
but there's a good chance
she has no idea.

46:11.083 --> 46:13.666
Uh, I never said I liked Alex.

46:15.375 --> 46:19.750
Well, hypothetically,
if you did.

46:24.750 --> 46:27.416
Communication goes
a long way with women, Max,

46:27.583 --> 46:30.291
especially since they think
men are incapable of doing it.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.125
And I'm going to go out
on a limb and say

46:32.291 --> 46:34.708
that if you did decide
to tell Alex how you feel...

46:37.500 --> 46:39.333
you might like
what she has to say back.

46:43.750 --> 46:46.000
Like, what is
in the Blegh Sex Shop?

46:46.166 --> 46:51.250
I don't know.
Uh, probably something
really gross or really lame.

46:52.375 --> 46:53.791
Dildos for dogs.

46:55.208 --> 46:57.083
Kale-flavored condoms.

46:57.250 --> 46:58.625
Oh, my God,
your dad's nudes.

46:58.791 --> 46:59.791
Ugh!

47:07.541 --> 47:09.500
Alex, are we going
to talk about yesterday?

47:11.291 --> 47:13.916
Oh, um, I just said
you volunteered at the home

47:14.083 --> 47:15.500
because it's easier for my mom.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.625
-Easier?
-Yeah.

47:17.791 --> 47:19.083
Check-ups are really
triggering for her

47:19.250 --> 47:20.708
and the idea of me
having friends

47:20.875 --> 47:22.500
still feels like
a death sentence.

47:22.666 --> 47:24.125
But she likes when
I volunteer at the home

47:24.291 --> 47:25.583
because she thinks it's nice

47:26.250 --> 47:28.750
and safe and boring.

47:29.708 --> 47:32.875
You're on meds though
so why is she so worried?

47:33.875 --> 47:35.416
Because that's
how anxiety works.

47:40.458 --> 47:42.250
Okay, I'm sorry.

47:42.791 --> 47:43.833
It's fine.

47:50.375 --> 47:51.791
Don't tell me it's Friday.

47:51.958 --> 47:53.416
I know it's Wednesday.

47:53.583 --> 47:55.083
-It's Wednesday.
-Yeah.

47:58.083 --> 47:59.208
What's all this?

47:59.375 --> 48:01.833
Oh, uh, we got Rosemary pies.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.125
Uh, but we weren't sure
what flavor she liked best,

48:04.291 --> 48:06.458
so we just got her
a slice of each one.

48:06.625 --> 48:07.500
What's wrong?

48:21.500 --> 48:23.333
Look who came
to see you.

48:24.041 --> 48:24.958
Rose?

48:27.041 --> 48:28.166
Rose?

48:33.208 --> 48:35.416
I, I can't let her
see me like this.

48:50.875 --> 48:51.708
Hey, Rosemary,

48:55.416 --> 48:57.125
Rosemary, it's me and Alex.

49:16.208 --> 49:17.250
You okay?

49:21.458 --> 49:22.500
It's not right.

49:24.458 --> 49:27.125
The way they have her
hooked up to those machines.

49:29.708 --> 49:31.125
I know, it sucks.

49:33.500 --> 49:35.250
But they are
what's keeping her alive.

49:35.416 --> 49:36.291
No.

49:37.333 --> 49:39.083
They're barely
holding onto her...

49:40.416 --> 49:41.500
for what?

49:42.458 --> 49:44.208
Some stupid moral compass

49:44.375 --> 49:46.458
that says
that's the way it has to be?

49:50.833 --> 49:52.083
That's the way it is.

49:54.291 --> 49:56.041
Well, what we can do about it?

49:59.500 --> 50:00.875
You can help her.

50:08.333 --> 50:11.250
Alex, you can't ask me that.

50:11.416 --> 50:13.750
-You said it doesn't hurt.
-I don't think it hurts.

50:13.916 --> 50:15.666
It doesn't look like
it does, but I, I--

50:15.833 --> 50:17.833
it's not like I can ask them
after it happens.

50:21.125 --> 50:22.000
Alex.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.083
I know you think what happens
with you is a curse.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.208
But those people who have seen
your face will never have

50:31.375 --> 50:34.083
to know what it feels like
to lose yourself slowly.

50:37.125 --> 50:40.458
To have your last memory
be withering away

50:40.625 --> 50:42.083
in a hospital bed.

50:51.333 --> 50:54.458
She shouldn't have to bargain
away her dignity to die.

51:48.541 --> 51:49.916
Hey, Rosemary.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.791
Do you want to go to sleep?

53:15.791 --> 53:18.250
Yu Shen, hi!

53:19.291 --> 53:20.375
How, how was school?

53:25.000 --> 53:27.416
She's miserable, and your father
is taking over the house.

53:27.875 --> 53:29.875
Max, will you please
explain to your mother

53:30.041 --> 53:32.458
that some of us have a stressful
job to go to all week

53:32.625 --> 53:34.208
and shouldn't be villainized

53:34.375 --> 53:36.250
for treasuring a minuscule
amount of free time.

53:36.416 --> 53:38.625
What does it look like
I'm doing right now, Paul?

53:38.791 --> 53:39.666
This is a job.

53:48.291 --> 53:49.666
So, how are things with Alex?

53:50.916 --> 53:52.833
I don't know.
She's not texting me back.

53:53.333 --> 53:57.166
Well, how you perceive things

53:57.833 --> 54:00.166
may not be how Alex sees them.

54:01.375 --> 54:03.375
Okay, well, how are guys

54:03.541 --> 54:06.250
supposed to just psychically
know what girls are thinking?

54:06.416 --> 54:08.291
It just, it makes,
it makes no sense.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.166
If I knew the answer
to that my house

54:10.333 --> 54:12.083
wouldn't be overrun by goblins.

54:12.875 --> 54:15.791
I'm sorry I enjoy the few
things that make me happy.

54:16.250 --> 54:17.666
So, now I'm the villain.
Max, will you please

54:17.833 --> 54:18.833
explain to your father
the definition

54:19.000 --> 54:20.083
of a double standard?

54:20.250 --> 54:21.708
Oh, my God, this is so stupid.

54:21.875 --> 54:23.500
You just need to stop
nagging him, and,

54:23.666 --> 54:25.291
Dad, you need to stop
playing that game so much.

54:25.458 --> 54:28.958
I mean, it's not that
complicated, holy shit!

54:54.583 --> 54:57.541
Ah-ha! See? I knew
she had a shift today.

54:58.166 --> 55:00.375
Just got to make sure
she's no longer with Craig.

55:01.166 --> 55:02.333
Shit, here she comes.

55:04.458 --> 55:05.916
-Bonjour, gentlemen.
-Hi.

55:06.083 --> 55:07.875
Have you heard
our specials today?

55:08.041 --> 55:09.375
No, but you seem pretty special.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.666
Wait,
don't we go to the same school?

55:13.458 --> 55:16.458
What? We should go
to the Spring Fling together.

55:16.625 --> 55:17.958
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

55:18.125 --> 55:20.625
- Pick me up at eight.
-Okay.

55:23.291 --> 55:25.541
Dude, what? You're coming.

55:25.708 --> 55:28.875
-Wait, so we're not even eating?
-No, that's dumb. You're coming
to the dance.

55:29.041 --> 55:31.166
No, I, I don't even go
to your school, man.

55:31.333 --> 55:33.708
Look, it doesn't matter, dude.
You're my wingman, bring Alex.

55:35.375 --> 55:40.041
She's, she's not
really talking to me, so.

55:41.416 --> 55:44.083
-What? Give me this.
-Hey, Dan, give that back.

55:44.250 --> 55:46.000
Come here. You can't just
take my phone and then--

55:46.166 --> 55:49.041
-Oh, hello.

55:58.625 --> 56:00.750
-What did she say?
-Hold on.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.000
-What?
-Just drop it.

56:29.958 --> 56:31.375
Your medicine...

56:34.000 --> 56:35.083
did you--

56:40.958 --> 56:42.125
Is it not working?

56:43.583 --> 56:45.708
They just need to up my dosage.

56:46.333 --> 56:47.625
But your heart, your--

56:49.083 --> 56:50.500
your heart's gotten bigger.

57:01.916 --> 57:04.583
I just don't understand why
you didn't say anything to me.

57:05.208 --> 57:07.750
Why, so you could freak out,
stop talking to me

57:07.916 --> 57:09.708
and I go back to living
in a padded cell?

57:09.875 --> 57:12.375
You didn't even give me
a chance and now,

57:12.541 --> 57:15.083
now I feel like I'm the reason

57:15.250 --> 57:17.291
this whole thing
has gotten so bad.

57:17.458 --> 57:19.333
I'm sorry I've made it
so bad for you.

57:19.500 --> 57:21.125
That's not what
I'm saying, Alex.

57:21.291 --> 57:23.291
You just have to wrap
your face every day, Max.

57:23.458 --> 57:25.250
I don't get a quick fix.

57:30.041 --> 57:31.208
It's really not fair.

57:35.416 --> 57:36.416
I'm sorry.

57:58.750 --> 58:01.083
This is the dumbest
tissue box I've ever seen.

58:06.125 --> 58:08.083
My mom likes
to hide little words

58:08.250 --> 58:10.083
of encouragement
around the house.

58:11.666 --> 58:15.500
It's sweet,
but her execution, it's...

58:16.875 --> 58:17.750
well, it's shit.

58:24.583 --> 58:25.541
Alex...

58:27.833 --> 58:29.541
is there anything I can do?

58:30.500 --> 58:33.291
You could be
my heart donor.

58:42.791 --> 58:45.083
Or you could take me
to that dance.

59:45.333 --> 59:46.333
...I assumed we were going

59:46.500 --> 59:47.583
to treat the Spring Fling

59:47.750 --> 59:49.750
as the proper joke that it is.

59:51.208 --> 59:54.208
Well, you look...
perfectly offensive.

59:54.750 --> 59:55.666
Thank you.

59:58.375 --> 1:00:01.875
Uh, so your mom's,
your mom's cool with this?

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.583
I mean, no, but, you know,

1:00:04.750 --> 1:00:06.500
it's not like she can say
anything about it.

1:00:07.041 --> 1:00:08.416
It's bad for the heart.

1:00:10.583 --> 1:00:12.416
They upped your dosage, right?

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:15.000
All good.

1:00:17.291 --> 1:00:18.916
Oh, uh, Yu Shen.

1:00:20.791 --> 1:00:24.416
Oh, what are you, uh,
what are you wearing?

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:27.791

1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.333
Hey, where's Alex?

1:02:59.666 --> 1:03:02.750
- Oh, uh, she--
- Yo, Valencia.

1:03:04.083 --> 1:03:05.833
I'm with
Dan now, Craig.

1:03:06.458 --> 1:03:10.583
-This fag?
-Ew, who even uses
that word anymore?

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:12.416
Me, I just, I just said it.

1:03:12.583 --> 1:03:13.541
I know shit brains.

1:03:13.708 --> 1:03:15.583
Nice.

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:17.500
Oh, that's, that's funny to you?

1:03:17.666 --> 1:03:19.916
Uh, yeah, I mean,
it's not, not funny.

1:03:21.291 --> 1:03:22.250
Who the hell are you?

1:03:24.958 --> 1:03:29.708
Oh, shit... napkin face?

1:03:31.333 --> 1:03:34.416
Hey, uh, how's it going
with the ladies?

1:03:34.583 --> 1:03:37.250
I heard this guy really knows
how to knock them dead.

1:03:39.333 --> 1:03:42.750
-What, nothing?

1:03:42.916 --> 1:03:44.041
Whoa, hey, man.

1:03:44.208 --> 1:03:45.541
Come here.

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:46.875
You're such a freaking
asshole, Craig!

1:03:47.041 --> 1:03:48.833
- Hey, hey.
-Yo, Valencia.

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:23.375
Back up!

1:04:29.583 --> 1:04:31.291
- Alex.
- No, let's go.

1:04:31.625 --> 1:04:34.416
Please let me just-- Alex!

1:04:47.416 --> 1:04:48.666
And to your left.

1:05:44.958 --> 1:05:47.041
If I had known you'd stay
in the bathroom the whole night,

1:05:47.208 --> 1:05:48.833
I would've taken
a different date.

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.541
-Shit.

1:05:55.666 --> 1:05:56.833
Should I get a nurse?

1:05:57.125 --> 1:05:59.541
Uh, they gave me
this amazing button.

1:06:03.166 --> 1:06:04.291
I love morphine.

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:09.041
Should you, should you be mixing
morphine with your medicine?

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:13.666
And what's that,
what's that do to your heart?

1:06:13.833 --> 1:06:15.375
What, what's stopping it from--

1:06:17.791 --> 1:06:18.791
Can I see your medicine?

1:06:19.708 --> 1:06:21.375
I, I want to see your meds.

1:06:26.125 --> 1:06:27.125
Where--

1:06:28.666 --> 1:06:31.500
Where's your medicine? This,
this says it's for heartburn.

1:06:39.708 --> 1:06:41.166
You lied to me.

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:42.958
You were going to jump
off a bridge, Max.

1:06:43.125 --> 1:06:45.458
-I didn't, I didn't jump.
-But you wanted to.

1:06:46.291 --> 1:06:48.083
What would you have done
if I hadn't been there?

1:06:53.458 --> 1:06:57.333
When I was four, they told me
my life expectancy was 16.

1:07:01.750 --> 1:07:05.125
I'm 17 now, and I don't
even get to enjoy it because...

1:07:07.166 --> 1:07:09.791
I know I'll still never
be able to go to college.

1:07:10.833 --> 1:07:12.375
I'll never have a family.

1:07:17.666 --> 1:07:21.000
And I accepted that I wouldn't
have any milestones.

1:07:26.333 --> 1:07:28.750
But I was wrong
because then I got one.

1:07:31.416 --> 1:07:33.791
Because then I met you.

1:07:37.041 --> 1:07:38.458
And I'm sorry I pretended

1:07:38.625 --> 1:07:40.583
like there wouldn't
be consequences.

1:07:43.958 --> 1:07:46.166
It was really selfish
of me and I know that.

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:51.541
I guess I just wanted
to know what it would feel like

1:07:51.708 --> 1:07:53.833
to be something
more than a burden.

1:08:03.208 --> 1:08:04.666
You're not a burden, Alex.

1:08:15.583 --> 1:08:16.750
I've...

1:08:17.791 --> 1:08:19.750
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

1:08:20.833 --> 1:08:22.750
And I've thought
of different scenarios.

1:08:24.791 --> 1:08:26.208
How long I was going to wait.

1:08:28.916 --> 1:08:30.458
How I should ask you.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.291
Max, I'm not
getting any better...

1:08:39.458 --> 1:08:41.000
I won't do that.
I couldn't do that.

1:08:41.166 --> 1:08:42.416
...and I can't put
my mom through it anymore.

1:08:42.583 --> 1:08:43.708
Do you know what
you're asking me?

1:08:44.375 --> 1:08:45.541
I mean, do you?

1:08:46.250 --> 1:08:49.625
Do you know what it's like
to, to watch someone die?

1:08:51.291 --> 1:08:52.875
To have that imagine
burned in your head,

1:08:53.041 --> 1:08:54.875
over and over and over and--

1:08:57.083 --> 1:08:58.333
Do you know what that's like?

1:09:03.875 --> 1:09:05.000
I'm not doing that.

1:09:19.250 --> 1:09:21.166
How can you not give us
any more information?

1:09:21.333 --> 1:09:23.000
Was he allowed to just
leave on his own?

1:09:23.166 --> 1:09:24.250
He's a minor!

1:09:25.875 --> 1:09:27.791
I mean--  isn't it
required to call his parents

1:09:27.958 --> 1:09:29.166
before you release him?

1:09:29.958 --> 1:09:32.583
Yes, yes, of course
I called him.

1:09:32.750 --> 1:09:34.375
He's not answering his phone.

1:09:35.333 --> 1:09:37.875
Please don't
tell me to calm down.

1:09:38.041 --> 1:09:39.500
My son is missing.

1:09:40.625 --> 1:09:42.375
Okay, is there a supervisor
I can talk to?

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:44.750
I need to talk to someone
who can actually help me.

1:09:45.166 --> 1:09:48.541
-Uh, I'm sorry,
hang on, Max, Max?

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:50.916
Oh, my God.

1:10:02.750 --> 1:10:04.291
- Max, what are you doing?
- Max!

1:10:04.541 --> 1:10:07.875
Max, no. Oh, my God.
Stop, Max, please, stop, honey.

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:10.500
-Okay.
- Oh, my God.

1:10:10.666 --> 1:10:12.458
-Okay, okay.

1:10:15.125 --> 1:10:17.666
- Okay.

1:10:21.666 --> 1:10:23.416
- I know.

1:10:25.208 --> 1:10:26.208
I know.

1:10:38.250 --> 1:10:39.208
Oh my.

1:11:16.416 --> 1:11:17.500
You can answer it.

1:11:42.166 --> 1:11:43.166
Hey.

1:11:43.583 --> 1:11:44.458
Hey.

1:11:47.208 --> 1:11:48.166
Still here?

1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:50.791
Yeah, didn't feel right,

1:11:51.291 --> 1:11:52.916
saying goodbye
with all those people.

1:11:54.500 --> 1:11:55.583
Yeah, I get that.

1:11:56.583 --> 1:11:59.333
- They sent these
instead of candles.

1:12:00.125 --> 1:12:01.958
Valencia's favorite
thing was to text.

1:12:04.333 --> 1:12:05.833
You talk to Alex yet?

1:12:06.958 --> 1:12:08.500
She's been trying
to get a hold of you.

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.291
What, are you,
like, avoiding her?

1:12:19.625 --> 1:12:20.833
Does it matter?

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.833
-Dude, don't be a dick.
-"A dick."

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.625
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

1:12:27.791 --> 1:12:30.333
Alex is sick, man,
and you're avoiding her?

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:33.041
I don't know
what's going on with you,
but that's super shitty.

1:12:33.666 --> 1:12:35.250
You know what's super shitty?

1:12:35.875 --> 1:12:38.416
Wearing this, every day,

1:12:39.250 --> 1:12:42.083
and girls,
girls never talk to you.

1:12:42.250 --> 1:12:44.375
And when you find
the one that actually does...

1:12:49.666 --> 1:12:51.291
Look, I know that this sucks,

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:53.375
but you being angry about it?

1:12:53.541 --> 1:12:55.791
That's just going to cost you
a chance to say goodbye.

1:13:28.916 --> 1:13:34.041
Hey, I, I just figured,
decorate the walls,

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:35.541
it felt so empty.

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:50.541
I finally stitched you
like one of my French girls.

1:13:59.708 --> 1:14:02.041
I'm really sorry I haven't
been here so much.

1:14:04.708 --> 1:14:06.833
I know this,
this isn't about me.

1:14:08.083 --> 1:14:09.041
I'm just.

1:14:24.208 --> 1:14:27.041
I'm just finding it
really hard to say goodbye.

1:14:29.416 --> 1:14:30.583
Hey.

1:14:31.791 --> 1:14:35.000
Don't be jealous that
I'm better at dying than you.

1:14:43.791 --> 1:14:44.791
Look.

1:14:48.250 --> 1:14:49.125
See?

1:14:51.083 --> 1:14:54.125
Who else is going
to do offensive shit
like that with me?

1:15:12.250 --> 1:15:14.666
I just want it to be over.

1:15:23.666 --> 1:15:25.125
Close your eyes.

1:16:24.458 --> 1:16:25.333
Okay.

1:16:38.375 --> 1:16:39.708
Max.

1:16:41.750 --> 1:16:43.333
I'm scared.

1:16:46.541 --> 1:16:47.666
You don't have to.

1:17:32.791 --> 1:17:34.375
Are you not feeling anything?

1:17:37.250 --> 1:17:38.125
I don't know.

1:17:39.916 --> 1:17:41.166
It's not working?

1:17:42.625 --> 1:17:44.083
Your face...

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.375
it's just...

1:17:55.791 --> 1:17:56.916
it's you.

1:18:25.416 --> 1:18:30.500
Help, help! I need help!

1:18:32.041 --> 1:18:33.958
Alex, listen to me.

1:19:20.750 --> 1:19:22.708
Have you ever thought
about if your life were

1:19:22.875 --> 1:19:25.125
a movie, what song they would
use in the montage?

1:19:26.958 --> 1:19:28.708
This is for one of those moments

1:19:28.875 --> 1:19:30.625
where your life derails you.

1:19:33.458 --> 1:19:36.125
And your head
and your heart can't keep up.

1:19:45.833 --> 1:19:47.666
Everything plays out
like a blur,

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:51.250
and all you hear...

1:19:54.916 --> 1:19:55.708
is this.

How are you feeling today
on a scale of one to ten?

1:24:05.250 --> 1:24:06.375
Um...

1:24:07.541 --> 1:24:11.250
I think, uh... like, a five.

1:24:12.083 --> 1:24:13.375
That's a wonderful improvement.

1:24:14.041 --> 1:24:15.166
Tell me, what's changed?

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:18.875
Uh, you, you mean, since Alex?

1:24:19.333 --> 1:24:21.833
Well, yes, but more so with you.

1:24:24.916 --> 1:24:27.333
Valencia's case
finally settled.

1:24:27.500 --> 1:24:31.083
The coroner said she died
of a serotonin overdose,

1:24:31.250 --> 1:24:34.708
or as the jury saw it,
natural causes.

1:24:36.666 --> 1:24:39.875
So, the judge dropped
all of the charges,

1:24:41.041 --> 1:24:42.000
even for Craig.

1:24:43.416 --> 1:24:45.458
After the trial, the publicity

1:24:45.625 --> 1:24:48.583
from the case made
national headlines.

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:50.958
Most people didn't believe
there could be a kid

1:24:51.125 --> 1:24:55.416
with a lethally attractive face.

1:24:55.583 --> 1:24:59.000
But there are others
who somehow knew,

1:24:59.166 --> 1:25:02.208
or hoped that I could help them,

1:25:03.375 --> 1:25:04.791
the same way Alex hoped

1:25:04.958 --> 1:25:06.041
that I could help her.

1:25:08.416 --> 1:25:12.208
I always thought that
my face only caused pain,

1:25:12.375 --> 1:25:15.833
what I learned was, I could
use it to take pain away.

1:25:17.375 --> 1:25:19.166
I still visit Esther.

1:25:19.333 --> 1:25:21.333
She sometimes
asks where Alex is.

1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:24.583
It's harder for her
to remember the big things.

1:25:24.750 --> 1:25:27.500
I tell her that Alex
is busy suing Danielle Steel

1:25:27.666 --> 1:25:33.541
for plagiarism,
that always makes her happy.

1:25:33.708 --> 1:25:39.666
The last thing Alex
taught me was that those
that see me for me

1:25:39.833 --> 1:25:43.458
don't find my face to be the most attractive part.

1:25:43.625 --> 1:25:45.500
Unconditional love
is the immunity.

1:25:47.375 --> 1:25:49.458
And while I'll never
live a life completely

1:25:49.625 --> 1:25:52.291
without wrappings,
I can find moments

1:25:52.458 --> 1:25:55.708
with the ones that matter.

1:25:55.875 --> 1:26:00.083
Even my parents
have gotten... closer.

1:26:00.250 --> 1:26:04.208
They found a way to meet
each other in the middle.

1:26:13.833 --> 1:26:16.666
So, what's next?

1:26:17.625 --> 1:26:18.750
I'm not sure.

1:26:22.458 --> 1:26:24.375
Maybe trying
to live without these.

1:26:25.458 --> 1:26:26.541
It's a big step.

1:26:28.250 --> 1:26:29.875
Do you think that's
something you can do?

1:26:33.750 --> 1:26:34.708
Yeah, I can try.

1:27:45.083 --> 1:27:46.541
- Come on.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

1:27:46.708 --> 1:27:48.125
Oh, God.

1:27:48.291 --> 1:27:49.291
- Oh, don't.

1:27:49.458 --> 1:27:51.375
I'll get it.

1:27:52.833 --> 1:27:54.250
- Oh.
- Pause it.

1:28:02.291 --> 1:28:04.375
Hey, so, my parents
thought it'd be a good idea

1:28:04.541 --> 1:28:06.583
if I apologize
or whatever it is, so--

1:28:07.416 --> 1:28:09.208
-Oh, shit.
- Oh.

1:28:09.875 --> 1:28:12.708
Shit, shit!

1:28:14.458 --> 1:28:16.750
-Oh, my God.
- I'm, I'm sorry.

1:28:17.833 --> 1:28:18.833
Damn it, Max.
