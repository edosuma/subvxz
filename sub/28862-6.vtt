00:15.422 --> 00:17.130

<i>In the future?</i>

00:22.463 --> 00:24.797

00:28.380 --> 00:30.005
Welcome to the future.

00:32.505 --> 00:35.255
I want all this sick shit to stop!

00:36.838 --> 00:40.422
<i>Will we ever be capable of knowing</i>

00:40.505 --> 00:42.588
<i>the origin of all things?</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:47.047
<i>Or is there still an origin before that?</i>

00:47.422 --> 00:48.380
<i>And before that?</i>

00:49.297 --> 00:50.588
<i>And before that?</i>

00:52.755 --> 00:55.338
<i>Do beginning and end even exist?</i>

00:56.130 --> 00:57.713
<i>Or is it</i>

00:57.797 --> 01:00.922
<i>all connected in an endless loop,</i>

01:01.630 --> 01:03.838
<i>and are "beginning" and "end"</i>

01:03.922 --> 01:05.588
<i>just different words</i>

01:05.672 --> 01:07.755
<i>for one and the same moment?</i>

01:07.838 --> 01:09.422
Mikkel?

01:09.505 --> 01:10.963
<i>Mikkel!</i>

02:43.963 --> 02:46.172
<i>Somehow, sometime</i>

02:46.255 --> 02:48.588
<i>The future starts somewhere</i>

02:48.672 --> 02:51.005
<i>I won't wait much longer now</i>

02:53.172 --> 02:56.922
<i>Love is created through bravery</i>
<i>So don't think about it twice</i>

02:57.005 --> 03:01.297
<i>We ride on fiery wheels</i>
<i>Towards the future through the night</i>

03:25.297 --> 03:26.338
Boo!

03:26.880 --> 03:27.963
Good morning.

03:28.630 --> 03:30.338
Good morning, sleepyhead.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.255
So?

03:36.088 --> 03:39.672
-What are your plans?
-I'm off to the lake with the others.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.588
It's supposed to storm later, you know?

03:46.547 --> 03:48.213
-Morning.
-Morning.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.088
Don't forget
Katharina and Ulrich's party today.

03:53.172 --> 03:55.755
-Don't be back so late again, okay?
-Yeah.

03:57.963 --> 03:59.463
Sure you don't want to come?

04:05.005 --> 04:06.172
Anyone want coffee?

04:12.672 --> 04:13.588
Fuck.

04:26.630 --> 04:27.713
Right. I've got to go.

04:36.672 --> 04:37.672
You okay, Dad?

04:39.463 --> 04:40.838
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:41.588 --> 04:43.047
Everything's all right.

04:44.213 --> 04:46.005
I just had déjà vu...

04:49.672 --> 04:52.172
Okay. See you later.

05:26.005 --> 05:28.505
Don't you think it'd be good
if you got out?

05:32.963 --> 05:34.713
Won't you at least try?

05:40.630 --> 05:41.797
For me.

05:44.297 --> 05:46.297
I still have to finish my picture.

06:10.630 --> 06:15.338
JUNE 20, 2019

06:15.422 --> 06:22.088
THE DAY BEFORE
MICHAEL COMMITS SUICIDE

07:19.297 --> 07:20.547
What's up?

07:23.838 --> 07:25.797
I've got so much to do today.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.547
I'm getting my period
and haven't shaved in ages.

07:30.338 --> 07:32.338
-I'm sorry.
-I don't care.

07:33.172 --> 07:34.963
-Sorry. I can't.
-You can.

07:35.047 --> 07:38.130
-Ulrich, I can't.
-Couldn't you guys knock for once?

07:39.088 --> 07:40.588
I think I'm sick.

07:41.172 --> 07:43.380
I'm covered in red spots.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.297
Maybe I have dengue fever?

07:46.672 --> 07:47.838
Come here.

07:53.297 --> 07:54.505
Shit!

07:58.463 --> 07:59.755
You've got rubella.

08:01.088 --> 08:04.255
You had to pick
today of all days for this?

08:06.547 --> 08:08.380
Come on, we're going to the doctor's.

SEARCH FOR TWO FUGITIVE PERPS
STILL ON

08:32.047 --> 08:33.505
Will you come by later?

08:38.255 --> 08:41.797
-This afternoon, to the hotel for lunch.
-Yes, of course.

08:42.505 --> 08:44.213
Is everything all right?

08:45.088 --> 08:45.922
Yes.

08:46.463 --> 08:47.755
Are you sure?

08:54.422 --> 08:55.672
Till later then.

09:14.338 --> 09:15.338
Hey!

09:17.172 --> 09:18.672
Where are the kids?

09:30.797 --> 09:32.297
I was at the nursing home.

09:37.505 --> 09:39.297
Shall we just go on like this?

09:40.047 --> 09:41.672
That you won't believe anything I say?

09:45.088 --> 09:46.297
Say something!

09:56.838 --> 09:59.172
Maybe this is why all this happened.

10:02.963 --> 10:05.547
Because I get nothing from you. Nothing.

10:07.922 --> 10:10.088
It's as if you're dead inside.

10:13.630 --> 10:14.922
About tonight...

10:16.838 --> 10:20.005
I think it's best
if I go to the Nielsens' alone.

10:40.922 --> 10:42.922
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>about the lady who drowned here?</i>

10:43.297 --> 10:44.422
Stop it!

10:45.005 --> 10:48.630
When the water is clear
you can see her dress down there.

10:49.380 --> 10:53.297
And sometimes you feel her hands
on your feet while swimming.

10:54.172 --> 10:56.130
But that's not the worst thing.

10:56.213 --> 10:58.713
The worst thing is, when she's hungry.

10:59.630 --> 11:01.922
Then she drags people down to her.

11:09.838 --> 11:11.255
Asshole!

11:12.630 --> 11:14.255
Ha-ha, real funny.

11:35.338 --> 11:36.672
You coming tonight?

11:38.130 --> 11:39.047
I think so.

11:55.588 --> 11:58.963
I sometimes wonder
if my parents are really happy together.

12:01.505 --> 12:03.922
Or if people just make do
with what they have.

12:08.005 --> 12:09.547
Are your parents happy?

12:14.588 --> 12:15.963
No idea.

12:38.922 --> 12:39.880
What's that?

12:42.088 --> 12:43.630
Looks pretty old.

12:47.547 --> 12:49.547
That's Saint Christopher.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.047
The patron saint of travelers.

12:57.755 --> 12:58.963
Don't ask.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.255
Hey, Jonas.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.505
Weren't you guys going to the lake?

13:38.338 --> 13:40.130
Martha and Magnus left long ago.

13:44.255 --> 13:45.672
Ultimate fist bump?

13:46.380 --> 13:49.505
Don't touch that pestilent boy.
He has rubella.

13:50.922 --> 13:52.547
Where's your bike?

13:53.255 --> 13:54.630
Should we give you a ride?

13:55.338 --> 13:56.547
See you tonight then.

13:56.630 --> 14:00.588
I know one person who'd be really glad
if you came, and it's not Magnus.

14:01.755 --> 14:02.922
-Ulrich!
-Why?

14:03.005 --> 14:05.630
It's no secret Martha's nuts about him.

14:05.713 --> 14:06.838
Stop it!

14:07.422 --> 14:09.672
Come on, get in.
We'll drop you off at the lake.

14:10.255 --> 14:11.755
No, it's okay. Really.

14:12.255 --> 14:13.338
-All right.
-Okay.

14:13.422 --> 14:15.005
Then see you later, Romeo.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.588
Gosh.

14:59.297 --> 15:00.297
Magnus?

15:00.797 --> 15:02.338
You weren't moving and I...

15:03.005 --> 15:06.463
I... I thought you were dead.
He said there was a dead body there.

15:11.630 --> 15:13.047
Still plenty alive.

15:15.297 --> 15:16.297
Cool.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.088
ARIADNE
A STAGE PLAY

15:41.797 --> 15:43.047
Something up?

15:45.338 --> 15:46.505
I was...

15:47.922 --> 15:49.588
I was just thinking...

15:52.672 --> 15:55.422
Wouldn't you sometimes like to know
what happens next?

16:01.630 --> 16:02.922
You mean in the future?

16:07.213 --> 16:08.422
Yes, or...

16:10.380 --> 16:12.963
maybe just in the next five minutes.

16:14.588 --> 16:15.463
I...

16:16.922 --> 16:18.505
sometimes get this feeling

16:19.880 --> 16:21.297
that something is about to happen.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.463
You know?

16:30.213 --> 16:31.255
Attack!

16:40.588 --> 16:41.672
Fuck!

16:43.588 --> 16:44.463
What's up?

16:45.547 --> 16:47.213
I've got to go.

16:49.463 --> 16:50.630
Where?

16:50.963 --> 16:54.422
We gave Grandma Ines
a tablet for her birthday.

16:56.338 --> 16:59.130
-I'm supposed to show her how it works.
-Okay.

17:00.505 --> 17:01.338
Then...

17:02.088 --> 17:03.088
see you later.

17:07.630 --> 17:08.505
Jonas?

17:09.672 --> 17:11.547
Why do you have a raincoat?

17:13.255 --> 17:15.088
Because it's supposed to rain later.

17:17.088 --> 17:18.088
Well, then...

18:03.172 --> 18:04.713
Weren't you leaving?

18:25.755 --> 18:27.255
Everything okay?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.588
I thought I still had time.

18:40.047 --> 18:41.672
Why do people say that anyway?

18:44.005 --> 18:45.463
"To have time."

18:48.213 --> 18:50.838
How can you have time
when it clearly has you?

18:59.838 --> 19:01.213
Has something happened?

19:06.422 --> 19:08.005
You're different somehow.

19:13.755 --> 19:15.422
I wanted to tell you something.

19:18.463 --> 19:20.213
I've wanted to for a long time.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.755
I think we're a perfect match.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.922
Never think anything else.

20:31.338 --> 20:32.963
I've got to go now.

21:14.213 --> 21:15.922
-Hi.
-Hello.

21:16.005 --> 21:19.213
Hey.
Did Captain Nielsen make you work too?

21:19.922 --> 21:22.130
All the best on your wedding anniversary.

21:22.213 --> 21:26.463
Crazy, isn't it? It's been 25 years.
Thanks for the glasses, Hannah.

21:28.005 --> 21:29.797
No problem at all.

21:33.130 --> 21:35.922
Well, who would have thought that?

21:36.797 --> 21:38.213
25 years.

21:41.380 --> 21:44.255
-I need to pee.
-Just go on the tree there.

21:54.005 --> 21:55.588
Can he use your bathroom?

21:57.380 --> 21:58.588
Hannah?

22:00.213 --> 22:01.588
Hello?

22:03.463 --> 22:07.047
-Right, then go in the woods.
-No, sure. Nonsense.

22:07.130 --> 22:09.505
It's just across from the front door.

22:11.588 --> 22:13.922
I just had déjà vu or something.

22:15.297 --> 22:18.255
-Mikkel has gotten big.
-He eats like an ogre.

22:18.338 --> 22:21.422
-He got that from his mother.
-Hey, now!

24:18.047 --> 24:19.255
Want more?

24:20.630 --> 24:22.297
-See you.
-Till tomorrow.

24:22.380 --> 24:23.963
Martha...

24:25.547 --> 24:28.297
Sorry I can't come over later, but...

24:28.963 --> 24:31.797
we've got a party,
for my mother and the hotel...

24:32.047 --> 24:34.047
I just couldn't get out of it.

24:34.422 --> 24:35.713
I just wanted to tell you that.

24:37.755 --> 24:38.838
No biggie.

24:38.922 --> 24:40.255
And I...

24:41.088 --> 24:42.588
I really like...

24:43.547 --> 24:45.588
your hair that way.

24:45.922 --> 24:48.213
I mean, you look good.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.172
With that hair.

24:51.713 --> 24:53.963
Shit. You know what I mean.

24:55.672 --> 24:56.672
Well...

24:58.047 --> 24:59.297
See you tomorrow.

25:00.588 --> 25:01.672
Bye.

25:01.755 --> 25:02.838
Bye.

25:28.213 --> 25:29.963
Wöller, it's me.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.755
I need you to find something out for me.

25:37.713 --> 25:39.005
Confidentially.

25:41.922 --> 25:45.213
<i>Give me your hand</i>
<i>I'll build a castle out of sand for you</i>

25:45.297 --> 25:50.255
<i>Somehow, somewhere, somewhen</i>

25:51.255 --> 25:54.963
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>For some tenderness tonight</i>

25:55.047 --> 25:59.213
<i>Somehow, somewhere, somewhen</i>

25:59.297 --> 26:01.422
-Hello, Martha.
-Hi.

26:01.505 --> 26:02.547
Hi.

26:03.463 --> 26:04.922
Glad you made it.

26:06.922 --> 26:08.297
Want a drink?

26:08.380 --> 26:09.630
Yeah, sure.

26:10.463 --> 26:11.755
Hey!

26:11.838 --> 26:13.088
-Well?
-Hey.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.963
It was meant to be a garden party,
but this is much cozier.

26:17.047 --> 26:18.672
I brought tiramisu.

26:19.547 --> 26:21.713
This is my favorite song. I have to dance.

26:24.588 --> 26:26.588
-Where's the champagne?
-Under the table.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.713
-Great. Thank you.
-We're so proud of you!

26:29.797 --> 26:34.047
I guess you deserve
at least a driver's license for that.

26:34.130 --> 26:35.130
-No!
-Yes.

26:35.213 --> 26:37.213
-For real?
-I promise.

26:37.588 --> 26:39.505
-Charlotte!
-Awesome!

26:39.588 --> 26:41.255
-You have to dance with me.
-No.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.797
-Yes!
-No. Katharina, please no.

26:45.422 --> 26:46.630
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:46.713 --> 26:47.755
Well?

26:49.713 --> 26:51.422
Do you know where this goes?

26:51.505 --> 26:52.797
Over there.

26:55.755 --> 26:56.922
Where's Peter?

26:57.505 --> 26:58.797
Summer cold.

27:00.547 --> 27:01.755
And Michael?

27:02.880 --> 27:04.297
Something similar.

27:05.213 --> 27:06.963
-I'll take this over.
-Sure.

27:07.838 --> 27:09.088
Champagne!

27:11.088 --> 27:12.213
Thank you!

27:13.213 --> 27:14.213
Hannah!

27:14.880 --> 27:16.713
Come on, live a little.

27:18.588 --> 27:20.172
Glad you came.

27:20.255 --> 27:22.380
Glad you all made it! Cheers!

27:23.088 --> 27:24.380
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:24.463 --> 27:25.838
To our health.

27:29.297 --> 27:31.797
-Now dance with me, old-timer.
-Sure.

29:02.588 --> 29:03.713
Jonas?

29:06.130 --> 29:07.880
I thought I heard something.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.505
How come you're not at the Nielsens'?

29:19.297 --> 29:21.005
Did something happen?

29:30.297 --> 29:31.297
Hey...

29:34.797 --> 29:36.297
Everything okay?

29:43.005 --> 29:44.797
What's with your hair?

30:05.380 --> 30:06.588
I know.

30:08.213 --> 30:09.713
What do you know?

30:11.213 --> 30:12.630
I know everything.

30:14.797 --> 30:15.880
What?

30:22.130 --> 30:23.547
Ultimate fist bump?

30:29.213 --> 30:30.297
What?

30:35.213 --> 30:37.005
Why did you just say that?

30:37.088 --> 30:38.672
Because I know, Dad.

30:41.463 --> 30:42.963
I know everything.

30:46.588 --> 30:49.005
I know your real name is Mikkel Nielsen.

30:55.255 --> 30:56.422
It's okay.

30:58.838 --> 31:00.047
Forgive me.

31:19.338 --> 31:20.713
Even younger and prettier.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.047
-I thought you'd pop with the third.
-How mean!

31:25.130 --> 31:26.630
What a sweet girl.

31:26.713 --> 31:29.463
Sweet girl? That's Magnus!

31:32.380 --> 31:34.672
-What's wrong?
-I can't sleep.

31:35.213 --> 31:36.422
Oh, no.

31:38.213 --> 31:39.713
You're burning up.

31:41.880 --> 31:44.547
- Look at these two ugly monsters.
- Let's get you upstairs.

31:45.588 --> 31:47.005
I loved that dress.

31:47.088 --> 31:49.130
You two are very sexy.

31:53.755 --> 31:55.422
There you go.

32:03.172 --> 32:06.963
-Sleep well. Night-night.
-Can you stay here till I fall asleep?

32:15.880 --> 32:16.963
Slide over.

32:25.213 --> 32:27.672
<i>So you're from the future then?</i>

32:34.880 --> 32:36.755
And why are you here now?

32:39.005 --> 32:40.922
Because I need to ask you for something.

32:43.797 --> 32:44.713
What?

32:46.880 --> 32:48.255
Not to do it.

32:49.255 --> 32:50.588
Not to do what?

32:52.588 --> 32:54.963
It's Ulrich and Katharina's anniversary.

32:55.755 --> 32:58.338
You didn't go along, like always.
You stayed here.

33:00.338 --> 33:02.005
But something was different.

33:03.547 --> 33:05.630
I should've noticed something was up.

33:06.005 --> 33:06.922
Jonas...

33:07.213 --> 33:09.713
-I have no idea what...
-Don't lie to me!

33:10.297 --> 33:12.505
I know! God fucking damn it!

33:14.297 --> 33:16.547
I know you'll hang yourself in the studio.

33:20.547 --> 33:22.255
Have you already written the letter?

33:23.255 --> 33:24.297
What letter?

33:25.338 --> 33:27.255
The letter you write to me.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.213
Not to me, to the younger me.

33:36.755 --> 33:40.172
The one marked: "Do not open
before November 4, 10:13 p.m."

33:40.255 --> 33:43.255
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

33:43.713 --> 33:46.547
The very minute you vanish.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.505
I'm here so you don't do it.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.463
It's all intertwined.

34:06.255 --> 34:08.005
Like an endless loop.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.380
But you...

34:10.463 --> 34:12.172
you killing yourself,

34:12.963 --> 34:14.338
that's the start.

34:36.588 --> 34:38.672
Promise me you won't do it.

34:41.463 --> 34:43.588
Dad, you have to promise me.

34:44.172 --> 34:45.630
Please.

34:45.713 --> 34:47.088
Promise.

35:10.380 --> 35:12.047
You forgot this at the lake.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.755
I put it on a cord.

35:23.797 --> 35:25.005
Thanks.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.338
I thought about what you said at the lake.

35:38.963 --> 35:41.630
About grandmas? And the internet?

35:59.755 --> 36:01.505
I think you're right.

36:07.505 --> 36:08.755
Okay.

36:51.172 --> 36:53.380
The night you vanished,

36:54.963 --> 36:57.213
you were there and then suddenly gone.

36:58.338 --> 37:00.255
Did you go back to the cave?

37:00.797 --> 37:02.797
How did you find the passage there?

37:04.797 --> 37:06.422
I didn't find it.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.297
Someone showed it to me.

37:11.047 --> 37:11.963
Who?

37:15.338 --> 37:16.213
You.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.088
What do you mean?

37:27.088 --> 37:28.380
<i>We were by the caves.</i>

37:28.463 --> 37:30.547
-What'll you give me for it?
-A kick in the ass.

37:30.630 --> 37:34.047
What's in here is easily worth 500.
It's yours for 200.

37:34.130 --> 37:36.338
-Daddy's got plenty of money.
-Blah-blah-blah.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.797
Stop the bullshit.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.755
Just give it to me.

37:41.005 --> 37:42.005
Jackpot!

37:42.088 --> 37:43.422
<i>There was this strange noise.</i>

37:47.505 --> 37:48.380
What is that?

37:49.463 --> 37:51.213
<i>We were all sure someone was there.</i>

37:51.297 --> 37:52.838
Someone's there.

37:53.463 --> 37:54.463
Shit.

37:56.588 --> 37:58.088
What was that?

38:01.797 --> 38:03.630
-Shit.
-What's going on?

38:04.297 --> 38:05.922
What's wrong with the damn flashlights?

38:07.213 --> 38:08.463
Come on, run!

38:08.547 --> 38:10.505
Now! Let's go!

38:19.922 --> 38:21.422
<i>We ran.</i>

38:22.005 --> 38:23.338
<i>Then I lost you.</i>

38:25.588 --> 38:28.088
<i>I turned around and you were gone.</i>

38:31.797 --> 38:33.630
<i>But suddenly you were back again.</i>

38:34.963 --> 38:35.797
Quick!

38:37.130 --> 38:38.338
This way.

38:40.422 --> 38:43.463
<i>You said there was something there,</i>
<i>in the forest.</i>

38:43.547 --> 38:45.297
<i>Something evil.</i>

38:46.297 --> 38:48.255
And that we had to return to the cave.

38:48.838 --> 38:53.005
You brought me all the way to the door,
and through the tunnel.

38:53.755 --> 38:55.672
I was so afraid.

38:55.755 --> 38:57.630
But you held my hand.

38:58.255 --> 39:02.130
And then you said,
"We have to stay here, all night,

39:02.713 --> 39:05.922
but when morning comes
everything will be all right."

39:06.672 --> 39:08.922
And when I woke up you were gone.

39:13.213 --> 39:15.672
All these years I've tried to understand

39:16.297 --> 39:18.088
why you did that.

39:19.547 --> 39:22.838
But then,
at some point it all just faded away.

39:23.463 --> 39:26.547
It became ever more unreal, like a dream.

39:30.297 --> 39:32.130
But that's impossible.

39:33.922 --> 39:35.588
I never did that.

39:39.047 --> 39:40.922
I saw myself today.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.505
Mikkel.

39:44.297 --> 39:45.922
It's all returning.

39:46.005 --> 39:47.713
That coat, you.

39:48.463 --> 39:50.297
As if it's all falling into place.

39:52.672 --> 39:55.338
Maybe you're not here to stop me at all.

39:56.922 --> 40:00.755
But rather to show me
what it is I have to do.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.797
Maybe you only showed me the letter

40:03.880 --> 40:07.172
so I know what's in it,
so I go and you live.

40:07.713 --> 40:09.338
No, that can't be.

40:09.422 --> 40:11.130
That can't be.

40:11.213 --> 40:13.463
He told me I could stop the origin.

40:13.547 --> 40:16.380
If you don't kill yourself,
none of the rest will happen.

40:17.422 --> 40:19.338
But if none of the rest happens,

40:19.838 --> 40:21.297
you won't be born.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.713
And maybe your role in all this
is much greater than you think.

40:27.130 --> 40:28.213
And perhaps

40:28.838 --> 40:33.213
I'm just a small part of a huge cancer

40:33.297 --> 40:36.713
that is much greater
than any of us can imagine.

40:41.005 --> 40:43.505
-Someone has said that to me before.
-Who?

40:44.922 --> 40:45.880
Me.

40:50.922 --> 40:52.422
God doesn't err.

40:53.172 --> 40:54.547
He has a plan.

40:55.755 --> 40:57.213
For each of us.

41:08.630 --> 41:11.963
I've waited a long time
for the moment we'd meet again.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.463
Who are you?

41:16.297 --> 41:17.797
Are you with Adam?

41:17.880 --> 41:19.838
There are two sides out there.

41:20.422 --> 41:23.963
He is the darkness.
I don't follow him, I follow the light.

41:24.672 --> 41:25.963
He lied to you.

41:26.297 --> 41:30.755
He brought you here to trigger everything
so it happens as it always has.

41:30.838 --> 41:32.130
No, that can't be.

41:33.588 --> 41:35.297
Adam wants this too.

41:36.297 --> 41:37.713
No, he does not.

41:38.755 --> 41:41.963
He doesn't want to fix things.
He wants to destroy them forever.

41:43.338 --> 41:46.297
Your role in all of this
is much greater than you believe.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.672
Only you alone can put an end to all this.

41:50.755 --> 41:51.880
What does that mean?

41:52.213 --> 41:56.005
We're at war,
and you have to wage it against yourself.

41:56.922 --> 41:58.088
Against Adam.

41:58.797 --> 42:00.213
But if I don't exist,

42:00.880 --> 42:02.505
if I'm not born,

42:02.880 --> 42:04.922
then Adam won't exist either.

42:06.005 --> 42:08.130
I've seen the world without you.

42:09.505 --> 42:10.630
Believe me,

42:11.963 --> 42:13.880
it isn't what you're expecting.

42:14.797 --> 42:18.922
There are times in life when you must see
that the decisions you make

42:19.005 --> 42:21.297
affect more than your own destiny.

42:21.588 --> 42:24.047
This isn't just about you and Mikkel.

42:25.213 --> 42:26.713
This is about everyone.

42:26.963 --> 42:28.422
Your mother.

42:28.672 --> 42:29.963
Your friends.

42:31.297 --> 42:32.422
Martha.

42:33.255 --> 42:35.005
You alone can save them.

42:36.963 --> 42:38.380
What does that mean?

42:43.588 --> 42:45.588
We all have to make sacrifices.

42:46.088 --> 42:47.922
Your father must make sacrifices too.

42:57.630 --> 42:58.922
It's okay.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.130
Is this the apocalypse?

44:26.047 --> 44:27.755
A bit disappointing.

44:28.422 --> 44:30.422
I imagined it being louder.

44:31.838 --> 44:33.255
More glaring.

44:42.963 --> 44:45.547
If the world ended tomorrow
and everything started anew,

44:48.672 --> 44:50.255
what would you wish for?

44:53.213 --> 44:54.922
A world without Winden.

45:01.213 --> 45:02.130
And you?

49:18.005 --> 49:19.338
<i>Dear Jonas,</i>

49:19.963 --> 49:23.505
<i>by the time you read this everything</i>
<i>will have already happened, irrevocably.</i>

49:24.505 --> 49:26.297
<i>It can no longer be changed.</i>

49:27.755 --> 49:30.630
<i>I would have liked</i>
<i>to explain things to you sooner,</i>

49:32.130 --> 49:35.047
<i>but I hope once you understand</i>
<i>how everything is connected,</i>

49:36.005 --> 49:38.130
<i>you will understand my decision.</i>

49:39.297 --> 49:41.422
<i>The truth is a strange thing.</i>

49:42.630 --> 49:44.713
<i>You can try to suppress it,</i>

49:45.422 --> 49:47.672
<i>but it will always find its way</i>
<i>to the surface.</i>

49:50.088 --> 49:53.713
<i>We make a lie into our truth</i>
<i>in order to survive.</i>

49:54.588 --> 49:56.255
<i>We try to forget.</i>

49:57.005 --> 49:58.422
<i>Until we can't anymore.</i>

49:59.588 --> 50:03.005
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>even half of the mysteries of this world.</i>

50:04.338 --> 50:06.755
<i>We are wanderers in the darkness.</i>

50:16.838 --> 50:18.588
You could have told him.

50:19.213 --> 50:21.880
You could have told him
what his task in all of this is.

50:22.672 --> 50:24.422
What path you really sent him down.

50:27.380 --> 50:30.880
Not much longer
until the last cycle begins.

50:39.047 --> 50:41.838
We all have to make sacrifices, Magnus.

50:51.213 --> 50:53.047
