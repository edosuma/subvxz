WEBVTT

00:34.242 --> 00:36.578
That year, we almost had it.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.956
I had just learned how to button.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.000
You should've checked my work.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.752


00:43.835 --> 00:45.045
Oh, my god.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.504
Look at Dad!

00:47.464 --> 00:50.717
Ugh, I should just destroy
those back-up glasses.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.261
I wonder where that necklace went?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.556
Hank! Guess what?

00:56.639 --> 00:58.683
You know how we always wait
until the last minute

00:58.767 --> 01:00.226
to get our Christmas card photo taken

01:00.310 --> 01:02.479
and always end up
getting Mega-Lo portraits,

01:02.562 --> 01:04.064
which are always terrible?

01:04.189 --> 01:05.023
Uh...

01:05.106 --> 01:07.275
Am I supposed to be
guessing something here?

01:07.358 --> 01:09.903
Mom got us an appointment with Ron!

01:09.986 --> 01:12.739
As in "Portraits by Ron" Ron!

01:12.822 --> 01:15.325
I called and got
the last available appointment

01:15.408 --> 01:16.493
before Christmas.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.413
Wow, this guy's even taken photos
of the Stricklands!

01:20.497 --> 01:21.998
This is gonna be great!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.793
It's all because
I did your favorite thing, Hank...

01:24.876 --> 01:26.127
I planned ahead.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.463
Well, you know what I always say...

01:28.546 --> 01:32.425
"If you plan ahead, then,
when things happen, you're prepared."

01:33.051 --> 01:34.260


01:34.344 --> 01:35.470
-Yep.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.596
Yep.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.931
Mmm-hmm.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.558


01:40.642 --> 01:42.435

Yep.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.813
Talkin' 'bout like a dang
ol' Rick Wakeman, man,

01:44.896 --> 01:47.899
instead of "yes" man,
you gonna dang 'ol say "no," man.

01:47.982 --> 01:52.278
I took it upon myself to upgrade
the entertainment value of the alley,

01:52.362 --> 01:54.823
and provide a soundtrack, if you will.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.741
Uh, I don't know, Dale.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.952
Conversation's already pretty good.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.161
But it could be better!

02:00.245 --> 02:01.246
I'll show you!

02:01.329 --> 02:05.959
So I was just opening this beer,
and the tab didn't go all the way in.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.673
So I had to push it open
with my Swiss Army knife

02:11.756 --> 02:15.009
and now, my beer tastes like
my back pocket.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.890
Wow, you really made that come to life.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.767
Tsk. Good luck following that, Boomhauer.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.270
Dad, Dooley ran away from home!

02:25.353 --> 02:28.773
He left a note with only two words,
"I'm gone."

02:32.986 --> 02:34.362
So Dooley ran away.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.157
Mm-mm-mm.
I am not the least bit surprised.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.286
There is no way you can keep a lid
on that powder keg they call a family.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.663
I thought you
and Melinda Dooley were friends.

02:43.746 --> 02:44.914
Yeah...

02:44.998 --> 02:47.167
Melinda and I took different paths.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.170
Let's just say her clothes
weren't the only thing

02:50.253 --> 02:52.088
that got casual on Fridays.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.631
I will leave it at that.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.383
Her values.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.218
I wonder where that boy is.

02:57.302 --> 03:01.472
If I were him, I'd find myself
a nice culvert to crawl into.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.183
Somewhere in Oklahoma,

03:03.266 --> 03:05.768
where the police treat you
like a human being.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.813
Okay.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.573
Poor Melinda.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.243
It all went downhill for her
after she married that Tim Dooley.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.703
Well, because she had to.

03:23.786 --> 03:24.913
Poor thing.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.041
First, everything else in her life,
and now this.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.751
Welcome, parents.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.587
We're confronting a serious
and difficult issue.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.298
Thank God we've got a speaker
to tell us what to do.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.800
"Here he is, fresh
from <i>The Montel Williams Show</i>,

03:37.884 --> 03:39.510
author Stephens Davies."

03:44.098 --> 03:45.016
Good evening.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.976
First, let me extend my condolences

03:47.060 --> 03:49.479
to the Dooley family
and the Arlen community.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.232
We must ask ourselves why this happened.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.775
Allow me to quote from my book.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.571
"The nuclear family
has suffered a meltdown."

03:59.989 --> 04:01.824
If you don't have a close-knit family,

04:01.908 --> 04:04.619
then every member
of your family is at risk.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.795
I'm back.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.216
Show's over.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.887
Dooley is the exception
who proves the rule.

04:24.180 --> 04:29.060
Yes, every second in this country,
a poorly parented child runs away.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.188
Excuse me!

04:32.272 --> 04:33.815
Your child could run away!

04:34.357 --> 04:36.484
My son will not run away.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.278
My family is fine.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.656
Don't you think Mrs. Dooley
thought her family was fine too?

04:41.739 --> 04:42.991
Well, probably.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.286
But really,
I don't think this relates to me.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.330
Of course you don't. Your family's great.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.250
So tell me, where's your son right now?

04:53.501 --> 04:55.211
He is at home.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.131
Then let's call him. Get on up here!

04:58.256 --> 05:00.216
Oh, yeah.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.342
Okay.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.553
Whoa! Look out for the books.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.514
On sale. With a forward by Marilu Henner.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.475
Are you sure you don't want
to talk to Melinda Dooley?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.852
She's right there.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.999
<i>Sorry,
we're not home right now.</i>

05:33.082 --> 05:36.919
<i>Unless this is Alex Trebek,</i>
<i>in which case, come right over.</i>

05:38.379 --> 05:39.964
Well, that's just...

05:42.842 --> 05:45.136
Interesting. What's your son's
cell phone number?

05:45.219 --> 05:47.055
He doesn't have a cell phone.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.348
Oh, terrible.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.642
You have no idea where your son is
or how to get ahold of him.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.686
So if he's gone, he's gone.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.104
Well, uh...

05:56.898 --> 05:59.734
This is the real problem
with American families.

05:59.817 --> 06:00.902
Complacency!

06:00.985 --> 06:02.195
Self-satisfaction!

06:02.278 --> 06:03.696
Igno-rationalization!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.448
It's a word I coined, it's in my book.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.783
And she's guilty of it.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.577
I am so sorry.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.788
You're ashamed.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.340
Peggy, I think you may be overreacting.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.466
Have you ever wondered

06:23.549 --> 06:26.010
why we can never get
our Christmas card photo right?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.305
It's because, as a family,
we are all over the place.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.100
Scattered, disheveled, eyes closed.

06:32.183 --> 06:36.813
The '77 Cowboys never took a good photo,
but they won the Super Bowl.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.398
Your logic doesn't hold up.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.026
Hank, when an expert
on families calls you up on stage

06:42.110 --> 06:44.487
and tells you you are failing as a parent,

06:44.570 --> 06:46.697
it would be foolish of you to ignore it.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.700
Which is why I got this.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.829
Now, when you go out,
simply slide your magnet to "out,"

06:52.912 --> 06:55.790
and indicate your destination
and estimated time spent,

06:55.873 --> 06:57.333
using these symbols here.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.920
I also bought each of you a cell phone.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.256
-Cool!
-Yeah, it is cool.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.715
It only calls me.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.092
Oh.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.468
Can I receive calls?

07:07.552 --> 07:08.594
From me.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.846
Oh.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.056
Peggy, this is unnecessary.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.058
We communicate as needed.

07:17.645 --> 07:21.732
Uh, well, I do like dry-erase boards.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.025
Thank you.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.323
What's that you're playing?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.576
-It's your theme song.
-What?

07:31.659 --> 07:32.743
I'm kidding.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.370
This is your theme song.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.750
No, no, it's this.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.215
It really is that.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.635
Listen to my theme song!

07:52.847 --> 07:54.807
Oh, that is so me.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.899
HANk: Aw, dang it. I lost the draw string
to my sweatpants again.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.485
What's that trick with the, uh...

08:05.568 --> 08:06.611
Peggy!

08:06.694 --> 08:10.364
What are you doing in your underwear
outside the master bathroom?

08:10.448 --> 08:13.576
I want us to be a closer,
more open family.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.245
What? Why would you want that?

08:16.370 --> 08:17.246
Bah!

08:17.371 --> 08:20.750
Because of what I just read
in Davies's book, Chapter 12,

08:20.833 --> 08:21.959
Get Comfortable.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.838
"Clothes may keep your body warm,
but they make your heart cold."

08:25.922 --> 08:28.841
We need more intimacy as a family, Hank.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.636
I thought that's what
the dry-erase board was for.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.555
Now, for God sakes, put on some clothes!

08:34.639 --> 08:38.893
Hank, the dry-erase board
is only the physical part of the solution.

08:38.976 --> 08:42.980
This hanging out in our underwear
is the emotional part.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.609
This is the way food
was meant to be eaten!

08:46.692 --> 08:47.818
No stains.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.154
I can just hose down afterwards.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.076
I don't think this is sanitary.

08:55.159 --> 08:58.412
Hank, you might feel better about this
if you took your pants off.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.455
No.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.875
All right. Look, if wearing your pants
makes you comfortable, do it.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.834
Anything goes.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.753
Do whatever you feel like doing.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.757
Ah. Good. Boomhauer's home.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.675
Uh...

09:10.758 --> 09:12.593
I feel like going out to the alley.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.725
-Hey, Bobby!
-Aah!

09:19.809 --> 09:22.770
I got these for the three of us
for the Christmas photo.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.605
Okay.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.074
So tell me what happened
in school today, huh?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.659
How are you feeling?

09:36.742 --> 09:37.577
Uh...

09:37.660 --> 09:39.036
Okay.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.746
Oh!

09:40.830 --> 09:42.123
It was classic.

09:42.206 --> 09:46.210
In gym class, I made a fart noise
with a deflated volleyball

09:46.294 --> 09:49.088
and people thought
it was Coach Kleehammer!

09:49.171 --> 09:51.299
No, no, no, Bobby, that's good,

09:51.382 --> 09:54.176
but what I want to know about, honey,
are your feelings.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.094
Huh?

09:55.177 --> 09:58.931
You know,
do you feel misunderstood, isolated?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.183
Do you feel like people don't like you?

10:01.267 --> 10:03.185
What do you mean people don't like me?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.105
I was the one who made the fart noise!

10:06.188 --> 10:09.567
Bobby, I would like to share
an excerpt from my diary,

10:09.650 --> 10:12.778
as I no longer want us
to have any secrets.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.072
No, no, that's okay.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.784
"Dear Diary, Bobby's eyebrows
have still not grown in.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.036
It is disturbing."

10:20.119 --> 10:21.329
Mom!

10:26.083 --> 10:29.295
I want my sideburns
to be even for Ron's picture.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.423
I'm gonna need you
to hold the laser level as I shave.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.467
Is there anything on you you'd like level?

10:34.550 --> 10:35.676
No, thank you.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.929
Close the door!

10:39.013 --> 10:41.140
Hank, there are no doors.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.059
What? No!

10:43.142 --> 10:45.227
Only when we take down our inner doors

10:45.311 --> 10:48.314
can we put them back up
and then not use them.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.233
So let me get this straight,

10:51.317 --> 10:52.902
to keep Bobby from running away,

10:52.985 --> 10:55.279
you have to do your business
in front of me?

10:55.363 --> 10:56.906
It's the only way.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.158
How did you even do that?

11:00.159 --> 11:03.496
I'm trying to take a shower
and there's no curtain!

11:03.579 --> 11:04.872
Come on!

11:11.921 --> 11:14.632
First one to breakfast
gets to sit on my lap!

11:33.693 --> 11:35.027
Oh, no.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.284
Why are you wearing your pajamas?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.328
I had to get dressed in a hurry.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.288
There's no doors in my house!

12:15.317 --> 12:16.652
-Yello.
-<i>Hello.</i>

12:16.736 --> 12:18.863
<i>This is a recording of Ron.</i>

12:18.946 --> 12:22.450
<i>We're calling to confirm</i>
<i>your photo shoot with Ron at:</i>

12:22.533 --> 12:23.951
<i>Today at 5:00 p.m.</i>

12:24.034 --> 12:25.161
What? Today?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.121
No, I thought it was tomorrow.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.372
Hello? Help!

12:28.456 --> 12:30.207
Somebody, please, hello?

12:43.971 --> 12:49.351
Hank, I need you to go on
a propane run for us now.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.734
I'd love to, sir.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.328
Can I hang out with you for a while?

13:07.411 --> 13:08.496
You can if you want,

13:08.579 --> 13:10.748
but my dad's been testing Tasers,

13:10.831 --> 13:12.708
so you really have to watch out.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.418
I'll take my chances.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.606
You have 30 seconds
until this appointment is over.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.108
At 5:30, I'm taking a picture.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.698
20 seconds.

13:45.783 --> 13:49.119
I'm so sorry, I do not know
how this could've happened.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.289
They should be here.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.333
That is your picture.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.292
Good-bye.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.377
Next!

14:10.099 --> 14:11.976
Well, here it is.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.521
We didn't know about the mix-up
until it was too late.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.897
We'll just reschedule.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.483
Ron is booked up, we can't reschedule.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.943
Didn't you see the board?

14:21.026 --> 14:23.612
I even used those
freaking <i>High School Musical</i> magnets

14:23.696 --> 14:24.864
you love so much.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.991
Neither of us came home in time.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.284
I don't understand.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.578
I called, I left messages...

14:30.661 --> 14:32.371
Hank, where is your cell phone?

14:32.454 --> 14:34.582
It's in my desk at work.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.166
But how are you going to get my calls?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.293
Bobby, where's your phone?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.335
Uh...

14:38.419 --> 14:41.046
It's in my desk at work?

14:42.631 --> 14:46.594
Oh, my gosh,
you did not want to get my calls.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.220
You were both avoiding me.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.600
It's all the extra attention
and sharing and what not.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.976
We felt a little...

14:54.059 --> 14:55.394
claustrophobic.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.772
Yeah! I've even had dreams
that I was a little bunny,

14:58.856 --> 15:02.318
and you petted me and petted me
and petted me

15:02.401 --> 15:04.194
until you broke my neck.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.615
Oh, I see.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.867
I just wanted us to be closer.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.368
Yeah, I know.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.704
Well, I have errands to run.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.331
I will not bother to tell you

15:15.414 --> 15:17.625
where am going, since it does not matter.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.968
I sure hate to see Peggy so upset.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.847
Dang it, somebody should invent a pill
that just makes you happy.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.183
<i>♪ Hank needs a happy pill ♪</i>

15:34.266 --> 15:37.019
<i>♪ Why won't someone make that? ♪</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:41.065
It's not a pill, but I make something
in my bathtub that'll make you happy.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.691
You know, none of this would've happened

15:42.775 --> 15:45.736
if it wasn't for that
family expert jackass.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.738
You mean, Stephens Davies?

15:47.821 --> 15:49.198
That guy's amazing!

15:49.281 --> 15:52.326
His theories, his sense of style,
the whole thing.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.703
I wish I could go
to his book signing today.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.871
A book signing?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.373
Yeah, at the Arlen Mall.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.376
I'd go, but I'm pretty busy
writing this musical.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.962
I think I'll go down there,

16:03.045 --> 16:06.757
get that guy to call Peggy,
and fix all the problems he caused.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.051
<i>♪ Hank's going to the bookstore ♪ </i>

16:09.134 --> 16:11.095
<i>♪ He's going to save the day ♪</i>

16:11.178 --> 16:12.012

16:12.096 --> 16:13.305

16:13.389 --> 16:14.640

16:14.723 --> 16:16.016
<i>♪ Save the day ♪</i>

16:18.686 --> 16:21.689
Sorry I was such a lame lab partner today.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.190
It's okay.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.485
I just feel so bad
about hurting my mom's feelings.

16:28.904 --> 16:29.947
I've got it.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.741
I'll just go down and beg
for a new appointment.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.618
I'm adorable when I beg.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.079
If that doesn't work, start crying.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.664
It works for my dad.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.424
I need to return these.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.759
I am no longer in the Christmas spirit.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.774
Sir, Mr. Davies
isn't signing any personal items.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.735
You have to buy his book and wait in line.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.362
All right, fine.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.868
There you are!

17:15.951 --> 17:17.244
Mr. Ron?

17:17.327 --> 17:18.370
Speaking.

17:18.454 --> 17:23.834
My family missed our appointment yesterday
and my mom's really upset.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.045
Is there any way you can squeeze us in?

17:26.128 --> 17:30.049
This photo means a lot to her
and she means a lot to me.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.759
Please.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.636
You know, I shoot families all the time
who I know hate each other.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.305
It's nice to see there are some out there

17:36.388 --> 17:38.599
who have real love
and devotion between them.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.851
Reminds me of I got into this business.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.187
So you'll give us a new appointment?

17:43.270 --> 17:45.314
No, no, no.
There's nothing I can do. Sorry.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.782
-Oh, please!
-No.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.290
Oh!

18:09.338 --> 18:10.422
And the name is?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.673
Hank Hill.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.176
I'm the husband of Peggy Hill.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.011
I can't do two names on one book.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.054
You need to buy another.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.099
Look, you and your got dang book
have upset my family,

18:20.182 --> 18:21.433
and now you're gonna fix it.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.979
Security!

18:26.063 --> 18:27.773
Oh. Oh.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.942
Hey, hey.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.277
-Oh.
-You are gonna call my wife

18:32.402 --> 18:33.904
and tell her that she is a good mother

18:33.987 --> 18:35.364
and we have a good family.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.700
Use this it's like a Bat Phone
it'll go right to her.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.743
Grip it!

18:39.827 --> 18:41.036
Why don't you grip it?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.830
I'm not going to tell you again!

18:42.913 --> 18:45.624
Now take the phone,
and make the dang call!

18:47.501 --> 18:49.545
Hank? What are you doing?

18:49.628 --> 18:50.712
Peggy?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.631
Aw, dang it! There he goes.

18:52.714 --> 18:56.635
I was trying to get your expert
to tell you that everything was okay.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.719
Mom!

18:57.803 --> 18:59.888
Bobby, what are you doing here?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.141
I tried to get Ron to reschedule.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.767
I even cried!

19:03.851 --> 19:07.312
I was faking it at first,
and then I started crying real tears,

19:07.396 --> 19:10.482
thinking about how important
this was to you...

19:10.566 --> 19:12.442
I'm doing it again!

19:15.195 --> 19:18.866
You are a wonderful husband
and a wonderful son,

19:18.949 --> 19:21.326
and we are a wonderful family.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.495
And I don't need a picture to prove it.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.832
But it would've been nice.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.002
The Dooleys?

19:31.420 --> 19:33.839
Dang it, we're a better family
than they are!

19:33.922 --> 19:36.508
We deserve to have our picture
taken with Ron!

19:38.510 --> 19:41.346
In fact, Ron will take our picture.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.056
We just have to work together.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.227
Hm.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.937
Well, hello, Melinda.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.816
Peggy. I see you found your son.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.942
We were all worried.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.110
Sarcasm.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.571
Well, two can play at that game.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.281
Cute baby.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.617
Sorry we can't stay and chat.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.119
We have an appointment with Ron.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.748
I have three months' allowance saved up.

20:07.831 --> 20:12.544
It's all yours, if you just run away
for a little while.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.254
You have an hour.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.054
Hey, Tim. How's uh... How's your boy?

20:27.267 --> 20:28.352
Dooley!

20:31.772 --> 20:33.148
The Dooleys, please?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.399
Uh, yes.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.984
We are the Dooleys.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.028
Ron will see you now.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.492
Which background should we use?

20:43.575 --> 20:47.955
It doesn't matter where we are,
as long as we are together in the Alps.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.004
Okay, now get closer.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.173
Father, put your arm around Mother.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.343
You know what?

21:01.426 --> 21:04.471
We are fine just the way we are.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.021
-<i>First one to breakfast</i>
<i>gets to sit on my lap!</i>
