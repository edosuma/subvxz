SAW THIS WEEK.
IT'S NOT THAT.
THAT'S JUST KANYE.

37:04.724 --> 37:13.066
SORRY, YE.
HE GOES BY YE NOW.
EVEN THOUGH NO ONE LOOKS AT THIS

37:13.066 --> 37:19.039
AND GOES, YEAH.
THE HAUNTING IMAGE I WAS
THINKING ABOUT IS THIS ONE.

37:19.039 --> 37:24.077
YEAH, THAT'S MY GUY.
BECAUSE THIS WEEK FORMER WHITE
HOUSE, I

37:24.077 --> 37:26.212
WANT TO SAY GARBAGE MAN, STEVE
BANNON WAS HELD IN CONTEMPT OF
CONGRESS, BUT THIS IS WHAT

37:26.212 --> 37:28.948
BANNON WANTS.
IT PLAYS INTO HIS WHOLE
PERSECUTED MESSIAH COMPLEX.

37:28.948 --> 37:36.222
SO BANNON IS SIMILAR TO JESUS IN
THAT HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN
DEAD FOR THREE DAYS.

37:36.222 --> 37:41.461
AFTER WEEKS OF INTENSE MEDIA
SCRUTINY, FACEBOOK IS PLANNING
TO CHANGE ITS COMPANY'S NAME.

37:41.461 --> 37:45.098

LAUNCH OF HIS OWN SOCIAL MEDIA
NETWORK HE'S CALLING TRUE
SOCIAL.

38:16.529 --> 38:26.406

BIDEN ADMITTED THAT HE'S NOT HAD
TIME TO VISIT THE SOUTHERN
BORDER.

39:18.925 --> 39:30.403
THOUGH HIS APPROVAL RATING HAS.
>> INSIDERS ARE SAYING DURING
MEETINGS, PRESIDENT BIDEN USES

39:30.403 --> 39:38.211
THE "F" WORD IN CONVERSATION.
MORE CONCERNING THE F WORD HE
KEEPS USING IS FORGET.

39:38.211 --> 39:43.416
>> THE HEAD OF CHICAGO'S POLICE
UNION IS URGING OFFICERS TO DEFY
THE CITY'S VACCINE MANDATE,

39:43.416 --> 39:58.565
WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE USUALLY
CHICAGO POLICE CAN'T WAIT TO

TO THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
>> THAT'S GREAT.

53:37.884 --> 53:44.157
>> WHAT IF WE PUT LIKE A SICK
ASS TREASURE MAP ON THIS THING.
RIGHT?

53:44.157 --> 54:00.140
RIGHT?
>> WHAT?
HOW SICK WOULD IT BE IF WE PUT

54:00.140 --> 54:03.677
LIKE A TIGHT ASS TREASURE MAP ON
THIS BITCH.
>> WE'RE DEFINING OUR NATION'S

54:03.677 --> 54:09.616
VALUES RIGHT NOW.
>> THAT'S GREAT FOR THE FRONT,
BUT WHAT IF THE BACK IS JUST

54:09.616 --> 54:20.160
LIKE A BOSS ASS TREASURE MAP.
>> YEAH, NO.
>> I THINK THIS, THIS MEETING

54:20.160 --> 54:25.965
HERE, IS MORE ABOUT ESTABLISHING
THE COUNTRY.
>> YEAH.

54:25.965 --> 54:30.670
>> THE TREASURE MAP PROBABLY
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE IS ALL.
>> WHATEVER.

54:30.670 --> 54:37.677
>> I REALLY -- I LIKE THE IDEA.
YES, I DO.
>> CAN WE PLEASE GET BACK TO

54:37.677 --> 54:41.481
WORK?
>> YES.
NOW IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE

54:41.481 --> 54:47.687
DECLARATION ALSO ADDRESSES
OUR GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE KING.
>> IT WOULDN'T BE FOR BABIES.

54:47.687 --> 54:56.930
>> WHAT'S THAT?
>> THE TREASURE MAP.
LIKE JUST IN CASE THAT'S WHAT

54:56.930 --> 54:58.264
YOU
DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOT FOR BABIES.

54:58.264 --> 55:05.205
I WOULD BE FOR GROWN UPS.
>> NO ONE WAS THINKING THAT.
>> I WAS.

55:05.205 --> 55:09.109
I WAS.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
IT'S NOT FOR BABIES?

55:09.109 --> 55:17.417
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING, YOU
KNOW.
SO WE COULD HIDE CLUES AROUND

55:17.417 --> 55:21.588
TOWN?
>> OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

55:21.588 --> 55:23.490
>> MR. JEFFERSON, DON'T
ENCOURAGE HIM.
>> AS LONG AS WE'RE PITCHING ON

55:23.490 --> 55:28.695
IT, MAYBE PEOPLE DO IT IN TEAMS.
>> WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
>> JUST LIKE IF IT'S FOR GROWN

55:28.695 --> 55:34.934
UPS.
>> IT IS.
>> MAYBE THEY NEED TO DO IT IN

55:34.934 --> 55:36.436
TEAMS.
>> I LOVE IT THAT.
>> WHAT IF EVERY TEAM HAS A

55:36.436 --> 55:45.145
STRONG GUY AND A SMART GUY.
>> WHAT ABOUT LIKE AN ART GUY?
>> YEAH.

55:45.145 --> 55:48.948
>> OBVIOUSLY, THE TEAMS WOULD
NEED A GADGET GUY.
>> ABSOLUTELY A GADGET GUY.

55:48.948 --> 56:00.093
>> ALWAYS IN THE BAND.
>> HE'S ALWAYS GOT TO BE IN THE
BAND.

56:00.093 --> 56:02.262
>> GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
THIS DECLARATION DOES NOT NEED A
SICK ASS TREASURE MAP BECAUSE IT

56:02.262 --> 56:09.035
ALREADY IS A MAP.
A MAP THAT LEADS TO THE GREATEST
TREASURE OF ALL.

56:09.035 --> 56:26.252
DEMOCRACY.
>> BOO!
>> COME ON.

56:26.252 --> 56:32.225
>> WHO ARE YOU?
>> WE COME FROM THE FUTURE WHERE
THE DECLARATION HAS NOTHING ON

56:32.225 --> 56:44.471
THE BACK AND PEOPLE ARE PISSED.
WITH NO CLUES TO SOLVE,
PEOPLE HAVE RESORTED TO

56:44.471 --> 56:45.939
VIOLENCE.
>> DO THE RIGHT THING.
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

56:45.939 --> 56:51.845
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
>> OKAY, GUYS, LET'S DO THIS.

ANYTHING.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO,
JOE.

1:00:44.177 --> 1:00:50.216
>> WHY WOULD YOU GO ALL IN ON A
PAIR OF FOURS?
>> IT'S CALLED BLUFFING, BABE.

1:00:50.216 --> 1:00:53.987
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL
WORSE?
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO

1:00:53.987 --> 1:00:57.824
UNDERSTAND.
>> ALL YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS
OUR SAVINGS IS BACK TO ZERO.

1:00:57.824 --> 1:01:01.961
SO WE CAN FORGET ABOUT BUYING A
NEW HOUSE.
YOUR DAD IS RIGHT.

1:01:01.961 --> 1:01:12.405
I'M NOT A MAN.
I'M JUST A LITTLE FAT GIRL.

THAT'S MY WIFE.

1:01:23.917 --> 1:01:29.122
>> SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> BUDDY, I ASKED YOU TO NICELY
LEAVE US ALONE, OKAY?

1:01:29.122 --> 1:01:33.893
>> LOOK, I DON'T WANT ANY
TROUBLE, BUT I'M A VERY, VERY
WEALTHY MAN, AND I THINK YOUR

1:01:33.893 --> 1:01:40.667
WIFE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON.

1:02:04.491 --> 1:02:10.263
>> YEAH.
PLUS, I COULD PROBABLY DOUBLE IT
PLAYING BACK.

1:02:10.263 --> 1:02:14.934
