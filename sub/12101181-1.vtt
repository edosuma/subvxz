00:25.265 --> 00:26.417
It won't work, Ashley.

00:26.450 --> 00:27.985
I want my present.

00:28.016 --> 00:29.841
Your birthday's tomorrow.

00:30.578 --> 00:34.130
I want Barella now.

00:44.305 --> 00:47.570
There Barella, you're
almost as pretty as me.

00:54.065 --> 00:56.145
You left Todd behind the sofa.

00:56.530 --> 00:58.385
You're special.

00:58.418 --> 01:01.042
I don't like him any more.

01:01.074 --> 01:02.673
That's no way to treat your old
bear.

01:04.593 --> 01:05.970
Leave me alone!

01:12.337 --> 01:14.033
Barella wants her dream house.

01:14.065 --> 01:15.089
I saw you wrap it.

02:06.322 --> 02:08.241
You're special.

02:18.962 --> 02:20.849
You're special.

02:23.153 --> 02:23.698
Special.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.449
Todd tried to get me, Mummy.

02:54.482 --> 02:56.881
What have I told you
about getting out of bed.

02:56.913 --> 02:58.033
But, Mummy, Todd.

02:58.066 --> 02:59.026
Todd what?

03:00.082 --> 03:01.970
No, Mummy, don't.

03:03.473 --> 03:04.946
Leave him alone.

03:04.978 --> 03:07.345
Scream again, and you'll get a
smack.

03:07.376 --> 03:08.882
Now turn the light off.

03:08.914 --> 03:10.738
Can I leave the light on,
please?

03:10.769 --> 03:13.426
Not another peep, I mean it.

03:20.881 --> 03:22.993
Special.

04:12.274 --> 04:13.489
Special!

04:15.858 --> 04:17.713
I said, shut it!

04:18.449 --> 04:22.354
If you want him so badly, have
him.

04:22.386 --> 04:23.762
Noooo, Mummy!

04:23.794 --> 04:25.969
Not another word.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.696
You're special.

04:39.762 --> 04:42.962
Special, special,
special, special, special.

04:55.793 --> 04:57.809
Caught you, you little shit.

05:08.882 --> 05:11.249
You're special.

05:32.370 --> 05:34.417
I was never one of the lucky
kids,

05:34.450 --> 05:36.402
the ones locked in a
cupboard under the stairs,

05:36.433 --> 05:38.738
cigarettes stubbed out
on them in the dark.

05:38.769 --> 05:41.330
Now I know that doesn't seem
very lucky.

05:41.362 --> 05:44.146
But those kids, they had nothing
to lose.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.930
No happy family, no toys and
games.

05:46.962 --> 05:49.681
They certainly didn't
have a bear like Benny.

05:53.105 --> 05:55.602
My story begins when I turned
35,

05:55.633 --> 05:57.682
the year Toy Box sold record
units

05:57.713 --> 05:59.858
of the state-of-the-art Rosko.

05:59.889 --> 06:02.097
Its creator made designer of the
year.

06:02.673 --> 06:04.050
But neither were mine.

06:04.081 --> 06:07.793
Ushering in a new era in Toy
Box's future,

06:07.824 --> 06:09.680
give it up for Richard.

06:10.322 --> 06:12.657
That's my competition
for creative director,

06:12.690 --> 06:15.058
brown-nosing Ron, my
boss, who has a stutter,

06:15.089 --> 06:16.690
but only on F words.

06:16.722 --> 06:18.770
These fakes pretend to like him,

06:18.802 --> 06:21.361
but we all know he's a galactic
tit.

06:21.394 --> 06:23.314
It's Reshard, actually.

06:25.073 --> 06:26.065
Reshard.

06:27.217 --> 06:27.985
Tit.

06:33.010 --> 06:34.385
Deep underground.

06:36.593 --> 06:38.162
A new breed of machine.

06:38.993 --> 06:40.594
Uncompromising.

06:41.969 --> 06:42.929
Devastating.

06:46.706 --> 06:47.537
Disco.

06:49.649 --> 06:51.920
Dancing disco AIDS.

06:52.466 --> 06:54.097
♪ Aids ♪

06:54.130 --> 06:56.306
Yeah, okay, that's my toy,

06:56.338 --> 06:57.874
but in fairness.

06:57.906 --> 06:59.921
It's meant to say RAID,

06:59.953 --> 07:04.465
Robot Artificial Intelligent
Disco System.

07:06.641 --> 07:08.466
Now I bet we're all wondering,

07:09.234 --> 07:11.537
who wants to give their
children AIDS for Christmas?

07:14.578 --> 07:15.538
I had a date

07:15.569 --> 07:18.097
with the stunningly bland Tara.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.729
Just you wait, babes.

07:44.146 --> 07:45.745
Shut up!

07:46.097 --> 07:47.665
Babes, who was that?

07:47.697 --> 07:48.754
Sorry, Mum.

07:49.233 --> 07:51.826
You live with your
fucking parents, babes.

07:51.857 --> 07:53.073
Ah, I forget to mention,

07:53.105 --> 07:55.697
I still live with my fucking
parents.

07:56.722 --> 07:58.610
Open your card, it's funny.

07:58.642 --> 07:59.762
You laughed at ET.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.265
Well only the ending.

08:01.297 --> 08:02.353
I don't wanna a huge number

08:02.386 --> 08:04.177
reminding me of how old I am.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.449
Aww. Have a cupper, love.

08:06.482 --> 08:07.985
40? I'm only 35.

08:08.017 --> 08:09.841
And now you feel better about
it.

08:09.874 --> 08:11.794
Oi, how would you like to be put

08:11.825 --> 08:13.777
on spin with dad's skid marks?

08:13.810 --> 08:14.770
Benny loves you.

08:14.801 --> 08:16.753
Why don't you help me
put the shelf up today?

08:16.786 --> 08:18.033
Because it's not your birthday.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.505
You're gonna have to learn this
stuff

08:19.537 --> 08:20.561
if you're getting your own
place.

08:20.593 --> 08:21.746
Who said anything about that?

08:21.777 --> 08:22.898
Oh I did think about getting

08:22.929 --> 08:26.257
my only place, but, cake?

08:26.513 --> 08:27.410
Every year, Mum and Dad

08:27.442 --> 08:30.353
would plan a special
birthday surprise party,

08:30.386 --> 08:32.498
which by the time you're 35,

08:32.529 --> 08:34.609
isn't much of a surprise
anymore.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.569
Ohhhh.

08:59.921 --> 09:01.137
Mum, could I have a?

09:03.634 --> 09:04.465
Mum?

09:06.737 --> 09:07.570
Dad?

09:08.530 --> 09:09.361
Mum?

09:13.521 --> 09:15.410
Mum say something.

09:23.249 --> 09:25.106
My 35th birthday,

09:25.137 --> 09:28.017
the day I finally got my own
place.

09:38.257 --> 09:39.154
Jack.

09:39.921 --> 09:42.290
The company
want foreclosure on the loan,

09:42.321 --> 09:43.857
repossess your house.

09:45.073 --> 09:46.897
No you can't, I'll get on top of
this.

09:46.930 --> 09:50.097
Ah, ah, I managed to talk
them out of that, just.

09:50.833 --> 09:53.650
I've convinced them to
restructure the loan,

09:53.681 --> 09:55.409
into smaller payments.

09:55.441 --> 09:56.241
Good.

10:00.274 --> 10:01.745
This says I'll pay back three
times as much.

10:01.778 --> 10:02.609
Four.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.266
You should be thanking me.

10:05.297 --> 10:06.834
Your ads says
the best rates in town.

10:06.865 --> 10:07.505
Oh they are.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.201
Just not this town.

10:10.289 --> 10:11.601
I just need time.

10:11.634 --> 10:12.273
That promotion-

10:12.305 --> 10:13.810
Has nothing to do with the loan.

10:16.465 --> 10:19.314
Listen, if I were you, I would

10:19.345 --> 10:21.297
sell the house, problem solved.

10:22.641 --> 10:23.697
This is my home.

10:24.561 --> 10:26.065
Not if you don't sign.

10:34.674 --> 10:36.689
That is my favourite
pen, if you don't mind.

10:48.817 --> 10:49.682
Scum.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.346
Excellent, now I do have to
inform you

10:55.377 --> 10:57.393
that if we don't receive
payment by the end of the week,

10:57.425 --> 11:00.017
the company will have to start
the repossession procedure.

11:02.705 --> 11:03.314
Biscuit.

11:03.346 --> 11:06.385
Oh yes, don't mind if I do.

11:40.017 --> 11:41.905
I wish I could put in the hours.

11:43.025 --> 11:47.217
But with a family, it's just not
possible.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.561
Then why are you here?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.545
Told the wife I was working
late.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.473
Working late.

11:51.505 --> 11:54.481
But really, I'm off
to the Prince concert.

11:54.770 --> 11:55.730
Fuck off.

11:55.921 --> 11:57.394
No, really, Prince is back.

11:57.681 --> 11:59.601
No, really, fuck off, I'm
working.

11:59.633 --> 12:00.753
I'm celebrating.

12:01.073 --> 12:02.129
Come on lets bury
the hatchet.

12:02.161 --> 12:04.977
No one's going to get promoted,
by being wasted Richard.

12:05.009 --> 12:07.025
God I hate people who
pronounce it Richard.

12:07.057 --> 12:08.113
You're not even French.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.249
So, no one calls Ralph Feinnes,
Ralf.

12:11.729 --> 12:12.945
Because he's Welsh.

12:13.458 --> 12:14.833
God I'd hate to be Welsh.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.009
Just go, I have to get this
finished.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.345
Lots of people are saying
you're already finished.

12:19.761 --> 12:20.690
Who's saying that?

12:21.361 --> 12:22.289
People.

12:23.314 --> 12:24.209
Lots of them.

12:24.433 --> 12:25.393
Jack?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.913
I suppose you're wondering
why Ron's here so late?

12:29.393 --> 12:31.441
He's here to tell you the good
news.

12:31.761 --> 12:32.914
Good news.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.321
About the promotion.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.050
No?

12:36.081 --> 12:36.881
Mmm.

12:37.330 --> 12:39.825
About the promotion.

12:42.737 --> 12:43.697
Jack.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.737
Jack?

13:27.729 --> 13:28.945
Hmmm.

13:31.058 --> 13:32.465
Precious!

13:40.081 --> 13:41.041
Jack!

13:44.241 --> 13:45.201
Sweetums.

13:46.065 --> 13:47.217
Come to daddy.

13:49.138 --> 13:50.641
Who's a good boy?

13:51.122 --> 13:53.010
Jack?

13:53.970 --> 13:54.865
Come on!

13:55.218 --> 13:57.169
Who's a good doggy?

13:58.449 --> 13:59.601
Doors opening.

14:01.297 --> 14:02.321
Jesus!

14:02.353 --> 14:03.249
Prince actually.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.073
But close enough.

14:05.905 --> 14:07.121
Hmmm.

14:25.201 --> 14:26.642
Here's the thing.

14:26.674 --> 14:28.177
I'm letting you go.

14:28.209 --> 14:28.881
What?

14:28.913 --> 14:30.482
I can't send my creative
director

14:30.514 --> 14:33.137
to New York in a Goonies
T-shirt.

14:34.001 --> 14:36.721
I don't have a Goonies
T-shirt, I have a Gremlins one.

14:36.753 --> 14:38.705
I don't give a fuck about the
Goonies.

14:38.737 --> 14:40.178
Me neither, you keep
going on about them.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.745
Or Gremlins!

14:42.002 --> 14:44.753
Young people today
aren't playing Simon Says

14:44.786 --> 14:47.281
in f-f-f-fucking fingerless
f-f-f-fucking gloves

14:47.313 --> 14:50.097
and shoulder pads, it's all
smart phones

14:50.129 --> 14:51.377
and blue movie players.

14:51.410 --> 14:53.073
Blu-Ray, sir, look, my designs...

14:53.105 --> 14:55.921
You haven't evolved.

14:55.953 --> 14:58.194
Richard's edgy, stands up for
himself.

14:58.226 --> 15:00.753
Okay, I am not gonna stand
here...

15:00.785 --> 15:01.777
Sit.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.010
It's just business, sorry.

15:05.649 --> 15:06.481
Please, sir.

15:07.858 --> 15:08.689
Hmmm.

15:09.681 --> 15:12.241
There is a junior design
position,

15:12.786 --> 15:14.481
two-thirds your salary.

15:16.177 --> 15:17.105
Best I can do.

15:17.329 --> 15:20.081
Sir, I can't afford a pay cut.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.042
I'm offering to help.

15:25.681 --> 15:28.593
Do you want my help or not?

15:31.633 --> 15:32.465
Yes sir.

15:33.553 --> 15:34.481
Great, welcome to the team.

15:34.513 --> 15:36.305
You're on probation, so
I want something fresh

15:36.337 --> 15:39.313
by Friday or you're out, again.

15:40.177 --> 15:41.969
Oh, and smile.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.266
You always look so bloody
miserable,

15:45.298 --> 15:47.569
plodding around like someone
died.

15:48.849 --> 15:49.362
Sir?

15:49.394 --> 15:51.409
I just gave you a job.

15:51.601 --> 15:53.457
Give me a smile.

15:53.649 --> 15:54.641
Come on!

15:57.233 --> 15:58.385
Good boy.

16:10.290 --> 16:12.689
Are you a loser or a winner?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.441
If you bought this tape, you're
a loser.

16:15.473 --> 16:17.810
Look in the mirror and tell
yourself.

16:17.842 --> 16:19.376
You're a fucking winner.

16:21.296 --> 16:23.794
Yes, I'm in the area
with a buyer on Monday.

16:23.825 --> 16:27.121
Should be able to swing by then.

16:27.665 --> 16:28.625
It's quite big isn't it?

16:30.418 --> 16:31.474
Must get quite lonely.

16:31.505 --> 16:33.809
It's more of a family home.

16:45.618 --> 16:48.818
Do not fear change, embrace it.

16:48.850 --> 16:51.570
Take your failed,
pathetic life and bin it.

16:51.602 --> 16:53.458
Become someone greater.

16:53.841 --> 16:56.881
Cheeky, we'll find you a new
home.

16:57.105 --> 16:59.857
One by one, you'll feel the old
you dissolve

16:59.889 --> 17:03.601
away, leaving an uncompromising
winner in its wake.

17:14.161 --> 17:15.538
Benny loves you.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.881
More. Weeeee.

17:22.354 --> 17:24.146
Goodnight, my special boy.

17:40.273 --> 17:42.896
Jaaaaaaack.

17:45.458 --> 17:49.489
Jaaaaaaaaaaaaack.

17:49.681 --> 17:52.114
Jaaaaaaack.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.754
Mum, mum!

18:03.025 --> 18:03.953
Jack!

18:05.458 --> 18:06.162
Mum!

18:09.202 --> 18:11.665
Leave the light on, please.

18:11.696 --> 18:12.560
Wait there.

18:13.585 --> 18:15.154
Cuddle Benny.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.657
Ta-da.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.529
I was gonna save him for you,

18:20.562 --> 18:23.058
but this, this is Benny.

18:23.538 --> 18:24.754
Made just for you.

18:24.785 --> 18:27.506
With one mission, to keep you
safe.

18:27.538 --> 18:29.489
As long as you have him by your
side,

18:29.522 --> 18:31.282
nothing can ever hurt you.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.776
Not even the demons in the
hallway?

18:33.809 --> 18:34.929
Apart from them!

18:37.074 --> 18:40.657
No, silly, not even the
demons in the hallway.

18:40.914 --> 18:42.320
Benny loves you.

18:42.353 --> 18:42.994
Come on, boy.

18:44.722 --> 18:47.825
Oh wow, cuddle Benny, more.

18:47.858 --> 18:50.993
We'll be friends forever and
ever.

18:54.961 --> 18:56.849
Benny loves you.

19:01.810 --> 19:03.026
Play with Benny.

19:06.738 --> 19:08.722
It's time to let go of the
past.

19:08.754 --> 19:10.321
Weeeeeeee.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.201
Cleanse yourself.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.873
You are not defined by
your former mistakes.

19:18.610 --> 19:21.202
But prepared by them to tackle
the future.

19:23.314 --> 19:26.545
Your life cannot change until
you do.

20:51.538 --> 20:53.041
Play with Benny.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.593
Press my tummy to make me laugh.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.401
Press my tummy to make meeee
laaaaaaugh.

22:51.985 --> 22:53.553
Cuddle me.

22:53.585 --> 22:54.994
Play with Benny.

23:12.210 --> 23:16.114
Cheeeeekyyyyyy.

23:17.074 --> 23:18.578
999, please state the emergency

23:18.609 --> 23:20.081
service you require.

23:20.113 --> 23:23.057
Oh, God, someone
murdered all my teddies.

23:23.090 --> 23:24.146
Sorry?

23:25.265 --> 23:27.697
Calm down, sir, there's no harm
done.

23:28.305 --> 23:29.906
All the doors were locked.

23:29.937 --> 23:31.985
Suggesting the intruder had a
key.

23:32.018 --> 23:34.225
It's normally someone you know.

23:34.257 --> 23:35.314
It's Benny.

23:35.346 --> 23:36.562
Someone jealous.

23:36.593 --> 23:37.553
Do you have an ex-wife?

23:37.586 --> 23:38.097
No.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.217
Anyone staying with you?

23:39.250 --> 23:40.050
No.

23:40.081 --> 23:40.658
Relatives?

23:40.689 --> 23:41.362
No.

23:41.393 --> 23:41.970
A girlfriend?

23:42.001 --> 23:42.449
No.

23:42.482 --> 23:43.121
Friends?

23:43.153 --> 23:43.794
A pet?

23:43.825 --> 23:44.977
No. No. Ok, there's no one else.

23:45.010 --> 23:46.737
I'm a complete loner all right.

23:47.313 --> 23:48.305
Good!

23:48.338 --> 23:51.697
Complete. Loser.

23:52.017 --> 23:52.850
Loner!

23:54.802 --> 23:56.882
Yes, of course, sorry.

23:57.105 --> 23:58.706
What about biscuits?

23:58.737 --> 23:59.729
For DNA?

23:59.762 --> 24:01.074
No.

24:01.778 --> 24:03.025
For my tea.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.233
Custard creams.

24:09.618 --> 24:11.313
I love custard creams.

24:11.345 --> 24:12.177
Ohhhhh.

24:19.025 --> 24:22.546
How many teddies were involved
in this massacre then?

24:22.577 --> 24:23.537
I don't know.

24:23.570 --> 24:25.041
All their heads are gone.

24:25.074 --> 24:28.466
They're still here, just
gotta match them up like socks.

24:28.977 --> 24:30.513
Don't I get some protection?

24:31.890 --> 24:32.465
Where's Benny?

24:32.498 --> 24:33.362
Who's Benny?

24:34.130 --> 24:34.993
My teddy bear.

24:42.641 --> 24:44.945
What, two megabytes of
level two cache memory?

24:45.457 --> 24:47.537
No, that's not good enough,
Rupert.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.074
It's caché memory.

24:49.361 --> 24:49.842
Say it.

24:50.194 --> 24:51.698
I just wanna give it a little,
uh,

24:51.729 --> 24:53.522
just a little je ne sais quoi,
you know.

24:53.553 --> 24:54.322
Boo!

24:55.890 --> 24:56.689
Joie de vivre.

24:57.266 --> 24:58.289
Some bon viveur.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.657
Crème de la crme.

25:00.690 --> 25:02.097
Ok, you know what, Bon Voyage.

25:02.449 --> 25:05.617
The Secret to Award-Winning
Success.

25:06.385 --> 25:07.025
For Losers.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.617
Well, they ran out of Dummies.

25:09.650 --> 25:11.473
You've left the price tag on
your suit.

25:13.297 --> 25:14.130
Hey, uh.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.897
You're not gonna win
any awards for this.

25:19.281 --> 25:21.106
It's F-Friday.

25:22.066 --> 25:23.057
Yeah.

25:23.090 --> 25:25.041
The thing is, sir, I haven't...

25:25.073 --> 25:27.921
I took his designs home to
cost spec, so it's my fault.

25:27.953 --> 25:30.450
Already have our new tech lady
on it.

25:30.481 --> 25:31.889
First thing Monday.

25:32.434 --> 25:34.737
Senior Product Engineer please.

25:34.769 --> 25:38.194
If you need voice control,
motion sensors,

25:38.225 --> 25:43.985
proximity triggers, or even
level two cache, I'm your lady.

25:44.017 --> 25:46.226
Well, I'm no lady.

25:46.257 --> 25:48.657
You provide the toys,
I provide the back end.

25:51.026 --> 25:51.793
Dawn.

25:54.385 --> 25:58.577
Now, finally,
you're on the road to success.

26:00.722 --> 26:02.257
Hey, this is David from Bay...

26:02.290 --> 26:03.025
Message deleted.

26:03.057 --> 26:05.361
Hey, this is David again.
Deleted.

26:05.393 --> 26:07.377
Jack, we still haven't
received the first payment.

26:07.409 --> 26:08.146
Deleted.

26:08.177 --> 26:10.322
Hey, this is David again.
Deleted.

26:10.353 --> 26:12.177
Come on, Jack.
Deleted.

26:12.209 --> 26:13.745
Jackster.
Deleted.

26:13.777 --> 26:15.890
Jackie, Jackie.
Deleted.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.002
Now, Jack, this is your final...

26:18.033 --> 26:19.441
Deleted.

27:26.674 --> 27:28.529
Play with me.

27:55.889 --> 27:56.817
Come on.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.561
You can do this.

28:01.521 --> 28:02.929
[Piss]

28:24.433 --> 28:25.617
Benny loves you.

28:30.833 --> 28:31.857
Cuddle me.

28:42.641 --> 28:44.337
Ta-da.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.233
Weeeeeee.

30:46.834 --> 30:47.730
Officers.

30:48.049 --> 30:49.169
Can we come in?

30:49.457 --> 30:50.961
We left our camera.

30:52.977 --> 30:53.905
Wait there, I'll just get it.

30:53.937 --> 30:56.370
No, uh, actually, we've
got a few more questions

30:56.402 --> 30:59.025
to ask about the break-in,
if you don't mind, sir.

30:59.057 --> 30:59.985
Just let me change.

31:02.226 --> 31:03.058
Shit.

31:06.930 --> 31:07.954
Mr Hunt.

31:11.762 --> 31:12.786
What is he doing?

31:15.570 --> 31:17.329
Come on, Jack, we know you're in
there.

31:18.993 --> 31:20.402
Why would he run away?

31:20.434 --> 31:21.745
There's a door there.

31:21.777 --> 31:22.769
Let's go round the back.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.058
He just shut the door.

31:34.866 --> 31:37.457
Mr. Hunt, just, Mr. Hunt, open
the door.

31:40.466 --> 31:41.169
What's that?

31:44.817 --> 31:45.937
Come in.

31:45.969 --> 31:47.314
Oh, come on.

31:59.890 --> 32:01.073
That's new.

32:05.426 --> 32:06.418
I like it.

32:06.897 --> 32:10.162
Modern art, exploding from
the boundaries of the canvas.

32:10.194 --> 32:11.825
Do you recognise this man?

32:15.793 --> 32:16.625
He's

32:18.609 --> 32:20.336
unrecognisable.

32:20.369 --> 32:22.225
Your account manager at
Bayvista?

32:22.256 --> 32:23.634
Oh, I recognise him.

32:23.666 --> 32:27.056
I just thought you meant,
you know, recently.

32:28.658 --> 32:30.290
He was booked to visit you
yesterday.

32:30.322 --> 32:31.856
He's not here.

32:31.889 --> 32:32.849
Maybe he's ill.

32:32.881 --> 32:33.937
That was our thoughts,

32:33.969 --> 32:36.721
until we found his car parked
at the end of your road.

32:38.576 --> 32:39.409
How odd.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.449
Can I borrow a pen?

32:43.058 --> 32:43.954
I'll give it back.

32:44.305 --> 32:46.321
Am I under any suspicion here?

32:46.353 --> 32:49.073
We thought there could be
a connection to the break-in.

32:49.105 --> 32:50.033
You're fine.

32:50.738 --> 32:53.073
Unless we find his body.

33:06.770 --> 33:08.850
Is there something you wanna
tell us?

33:22.290 --> 33:23.665
No.

33:23.696 --> 33:25.777
Just, just hope he's okay,
that's all.

33:25.809 --> 33:26.994
It's probably nothing.

33:30.449 --> 33:31.281
Hang on.

33:33.682 --> 33:34.834
It's not the same.

33:36.466 --> 33:38.321
Without custard creams.

33:39.474 --> 33:42.097
Now which cupboard are they?

33:46.418 --> 33:48.849
No, no biscuits.

33:49.298 --> 33:50.129
Really?

33:55.473 --> 33:57.809
They were cheap ones anyway.

33:58.034 --> 33:59.762
Leave it, Sarge.

33:59.794 --> 34:01.329
It's not worth it.

34:05.969 --> 34:08.146
Oh, you found your bear then?

34:19.985 --> 34:21.295
Oh my God.

34:29.297 --> 34:31.346
Benny loves you.

34:31.378 --> 34:32.242
Fuck!

34:39.730 --> 34:40.657
Benny?

34:57.362 --> 34:59.314
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

35:00.721 --> 35:01.713
Cuddle me.

35:05.009 --> 35:06.449
Weeeeeeeee.

35:06.481 --> 35:07.889
Benny loves you.

35:07.922 --> 35:08.786
Okay.

35:08.818 --> 35:10.289
Play with Benny.

35:10.321 --> 35:11.345
Oh wow.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.080
All right.

35:12.113 --> 35:13.778
More, more, more.

35:13.810 --> 35:14.578
Okay.

35:14.609 --> 35:15.378
Oh wow.

35:15.410 --> 35:16.210
Okay, enough.

35:16.242 --> 35:17.840
More, more.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.369
Weeeeeeeeeee!

35:20.402 --> 35:21.233
No way.

35:21.905 --> 35:23.633
It's Benny.

35:25.202 --> 35:26.641
Play with Benny.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.458
Oh fuck, I need a beer.

35:41.489 --> 35:42.896
Okey dokey.

35:43.378 --> 35:45.873
Benny loves you, Benny
loves you.

35:47.122 --> 35:48.274
Play with Benny.

35:54.673 --> 35:55.826
Why did you kill him?

35:56.690 --> 35:58.256
Benny loves you.

36:00.754 --> 36:03.378
Okay, for the moment, you can
stay here.

36:03.410 --> 36:04.976
Weeeeeeeeee!

36:05.009 --> 36:06.800
Under the conditions no one else
dies,

36:06.833 --> 36:10.289
stay completely out of sight,
no one can know you're here.

36:10.322 --> 36:12.242
Just until I figure out what to
do.

36:12.274 --> 36:14.033
Okey dokey.

36:14.418 --> 36:15.922
My house, my rules.

36:16.433 --> 36:18.770
Look, we can't just kill
people we don't like, okay?

36:18.802 --> 36:20.753
You have to promise.

36:21.138 --> 36:22.834
Are you listening?

36:23.089 --> 36:24.176
Say okey dokey.

36:24.433 --> 36:25.426
Okey dokey.

36:25.745 --> 36:27.217
Cuddle Benny.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.146
Later.

36:30.418 --> 36:32.338
Weeeeeeeeeeee!

36:42.833 --> 36:43.666
Shit!

36:45.809 --> 36:46.769
Calm down, Benny.

36:48.466 --> 36:49.522
Oi.

36:49.553 --> 36:51.634
Look, it's really nice to
have you around and that,

36:51.665 --> 36:53.554
but, sit.

36:54.896 --> 36:56.177
And put that knife down.

36:58.769 --> 36:59.600
Good boy.

37:27.762 --> 37:29.938
Cuddly robotic killers.

37:29.969 --> 37:31.025
A whole universe.

37:31.058 --> 37:33.233
They've got different
personalities, weapons, outfits.

37:33.265 --> 37:34.610
They can talk to each other,
interact.

37:34.642 --> 37:35.602
They can even fight.

37:37.201 --> 37:38.033
This could be huge.

37:38.578 --> 37:39.473
Huge.

37:41.233 --> 37:43.153
Have you had a brain
haemorrhage?

37:43.378 --> 37:44.816
Think young adults, collectors,

37:44.850 --> 37:46.418
teenagers, horror fans, comic
fans.

37:46.449 --> 37:48.146
Losers, virgins, chumps.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.970
There's a huge market out there.

37:50.002 --> 37:52.018
Let me create toys for a new
demographic.

37:52.274 --> 37:52.913
Loser.

37:52.946 --> 37:53.713
As the new creative director,

37:53.746 --> 37:54.866
I'm not gonna allow this project
to...

37:54.898 --> 37:58.225
Sorry, did I say that you
were the new creative director?

37:58.257 --> 38:00.113
Yeah, well, you fired
him, so, here I am.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.913
Did I say that you were
the new creative director?

38:04.944 --> 38:06.322
99%, yeah.

38:08.017 --> 38:10.673
Did I say

38:10.704 --> 38:12.146
that you

38:12.178 --> 38:13.777
were the new

38:13.810 --> 38:15.185
creative

38:15.218 --> 38:16.497
director?

38:16.530 --> 38:17.777
99%.

38:17.810 --> 38:21.330
Well you didn't use that
exact specific sentence,

38:21.361 --> 38:24.593
but just juggle some of
the words around, and, yes.

38:24.626 --> 38:25.713
Yes.

38:29.233 --> 38:30.097
No.

38:30.130 --> 38:30.897
No.

38:30.930 --> 38:33.202
Let's see where this goes, shall
we?

38:59.345 --> 39:01.714
Hold it there. Hold. Hold.

39:53.969 --> 39:56.434
Aren't you beautiful, yes-

39:56.786 --> 39:57.617
No!

40:31.442 --> 40:32.402
High-five.

58:10.417 --> 58:11.794
You've lost it.

58:11.825 --> 58:13.073
This is the end of you, the end.

58:13.106 --> 58:14.129
But it wasn't me.

58:14.162 --> 58:16.082
You wait till the police
hear about this, you maniac.

58:16.113 --> 58:17.777
Look. Let's not do anything we
might regret.

58:17.810 --> 58:19.666
Let's just think about this.

58:22.769 --> 58:25.137
Untie me, you f-f-fucking idiot.

58:25.169 --> 58:26.417
Yes, sir, I'm sorry sir.

58:27.633 --> 58:29.041
There's a good boy.

58:32.849 --> 58:33.681
What?

58:34.674 --> 58:36.017
I said, hurry up, come on.

58:36.337 --> 58:39.153
No, you said good boy.

58:39.346 --> 58:40.561
So what?

58:43.570 --> 58:44.690
What are you playing at?

58:44.882 --> 58:47.217
You've never really understood

58:47.249 --> 58:48.337
what I'm capable of.

58:48.370 --> 58:50.642
After my Precious, I'm very well
aware.

58:52.370 --> 58:53.585
Precious got it easy,

58:54.353 --> 58:56.433
and you're in no position to
negotiate.

59:00.370 --> 59:01.617
What do you want?

59:02.097 --> 59:04.913
Hmm, let's say I hang on to this
photo,

59:06.097 --> 59:07.761
you give me that promotion.

59:08.530 --> 59:10.354
Double my salary.

59:10.673 --> 59:14.481
And we never speak of this
again.

59:14.803 --> 59:16.177
It's just business.

59:17.426 --> 59:18.513
You're joking?

59:18.545 --> 59:19.954
Am I?

59:20.402 --> 59:21.905
Nothing to lose.

59:24.305 --> 59:27.089
Okay, whatever
you want, just untie me.

59:30.993 --> 59:32.337
Then give me a smile.

59:34.321 --> 59:35.537
What?

59:35.570 --> 59:36.626
Give

59:36.657 --> 59:38.065
me

59:38.097 --> 59:39.089
a smile.

59:48.273 --> 59:49.521
Good boy.

59:50.386 --> 59:55.313
Now tell me I'm a fucking
fabulous first-rate designer.

59:55.345 --> 59:56.593
Look, this isn't necessary.

59:56.625 --> 59:58.129
Say it, bitch.

01:00:01.105 --> 01:00:04.145
You're a f-f-f-f-f-fucking
f-f-f-f-fabulous

01:00:04.177 --> 01:00:08.369
f-f-first rate f-f-f-f-fucking
designer.

01:00:08.753 --> 01:00:12.689
Now tell me you love being my
bitch.

01:00:15.665 --> 01:00:17.009
I love being your bitch.

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:22.225
No.

01:00:25.681 --> 01:00:26.353
No!

01:00:58.289 --> 01:00:59.697
Ta-da.

01:01:06.962 --> 01:01:07.793
This

01:01:09.617 --> 01:01:10.449
is not

01:01:11.633 --> 01:01:13.105
a present.

01:01:16.241 --> 01:01:17.937
Benny loves you.

01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:18.801
Yeah?

01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:21.874
Well Jack hates you.

01:01:29.489 --> 01:01:30.577
Cuddle me.

01:01:34.449 --> 01:01:35.730
Benny loves you.

01:01:44.305 --> 01:01:45.426
You're a winner.

01:01:48.657 --> 01:01:49.809
You're a winner.

01:01:52.593 --> 01:01:53.905
You're a winner.

01:01:56.882 --> 01:01:58.385
You're a winner.

01:02:01.201 --> 01:02:02.513
You're a winner.

01:02:15.058 --> 01:02:16.561
You're a loser.

01:02:22.353 --> 01:02:23.345
Listen, I've just...

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.969
You're wearing a party hat.

01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:30.929
It's my birthday.

01:02:32.241 --> 01:02:33.073
Was.

01:02:33.937 --> 01:02:34.737
I'm cleaning.

01:02:34.769 --> 01:02:36.338
Okay, weird.

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:37.777
I've come to pick up the
prototype.

01:02:37.809 --> 01:02:39.122
Otherwise, they're gonna fire me
too.

01:02:39.154 --> 01:02:40.178
It's not what you think it was.

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:41.138
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:42.385
I protected you.

01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:44.018
From a pug?

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.489
I think it had rabies.

01:02:48.145 --> 01:02:49.618
In everything that's happened,

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:53.041
the one thing I don't
regret is meeting you.

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:58.065
Whatever anyone says,
whatever you hear about me,

01:02:59.378 --> 01:03:00.817
I'm not Norman Bates, okay?

01:03:01.681 --> 01:03:02.513
Good.

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.521
I can't bear cross-dressers.

01:03:09.489 --> 01:03:10.545
Friends?

01:03:19.506 --> 01:03:20.913
I should go.

01:03:20.945 --> 01:03:21.777
Stay.

01:03:23.154 --> 01:03:24.242
And do what?

01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:41.490
Cleaning up dog remains.

01:03:41.937 --> 01:03:43.442
This is not Grand Theft Auto.

01:03:45.073 --> 01:03:46.833
You really know how to treat a
lady.

01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:49.585
You're not a lady.

01:05:46.865 --> 01:05:47.665
Dawn?

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.113
Shit.

01:06:16.114 --> 01:06:17.969
Cuddle Benny.

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:23.698
Good job.

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.193
How did you convince him?

01:06:27.953 --> 01:06:29.169
I didn't.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:40.753
Benny loves you.

01:06:48.145 --> 01:06:49.330
Play with Benny.

01:06:53.394 --> 01:06:54.449
Let's cut it open.

01:06:56.465 --> 01:06:57.841
Get away from him!

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.258
She's not my type.

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:04.400
The bear, he'll kill you all.

01:07:09.778 --> 01:07:11.120
Poor Jack.

01:07:12.113 --> 01:07:13.265
He's just a teddy.

01:07:13.682 --> 01:07:14.960
He's alive.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:16.594
Ah.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.025
Come on, Benny, Jack's here.

01:07:20.753 --> 01:07:21.905
He's playing dead.

01:07:22.193 --> 01:07:23.026
Come on Benny.

01:07:23.633 --> 01:07:26.066
He's upset because I buried him
alive.

01:07:26.322 --> 01:07:27.922
Well you deserved that.

01:07:27.953 --> 01:07:29.585
Now I bet we're all wondering.

01:07:38.353 --> 01:07:41.330
Richard, have I ever told you

01:07:42.162 --> 01:07:43.346
how much I love you?

01:07:43.634 --> 01:07:46.066
Aw, well, thanks, Jack.

01:07:57.586 --> 01:07:59.089
Benny loves you.

01:07:59.473 --> 01:08:02.033
If you want her, you've
gotta go through me.

01:08:03.056 --> 01:08:04.016
Or Richard.

01:08:04.049 --> 01:08:04.594
What?

01:08:13.616 --> 01:08:14.706
It's Benny.

01:08:16.209 --> 01:08:17.425
Cuddle me.

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:23.761
My car.

01:08:23.794 --> 01:08:24.593
My car.

01:08:24.626 --> 01:08:26.225
Two-seaters are fucking death
traps.

01:08:26.256 --> 01:08:28.015
Give me the keys, you can't
drive.

01:08:31.505 --> 01:08:33.394
Mirror, signal...

01:08:33.425 --> 01:08:35.058
Manoeuvre, Jack, fucking
manoeuvre.

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.953
I can't drive.

01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:36.850
Move!

01:08:41.938 --> 01:08:43.792
Be careful with her.

01:08:43.826 --> 01:08:45.522
She's the most beautiful
girl in the world.

01:08:45.553 --> 01:08:46.513
Let's go.

01:09:04.594 --> 01:09:05.425
Cuddle me.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:16.625
Weeeee.

01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:26.640
Ta-da.

01:09:42.162 --> 01:09:43.856
Could it be a midget in a
costume?

01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:46.930
Toys don't come to life
when you treat them like shit.

01:09:46.962 --> 01:09:48.593
They don't come to life at all,
in fact.

01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:49.841
We should go to the police.

01:09:49.872 --> 01:09:50.962
The staff were witnesses.

01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:52.113
All dead.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:55.537
I should know, I've got three
bodies in my back garden.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:56.945
Three?

01:09:56.978 --> 01:09:58.224
Five.

01:09:58.257 --> 01:09:59.570
If you count pets.

01:09:59.602 --> 01:10:01.618
Look, he can't be bargained
with.

01:10:01.649 --> 01:10:03.538
He doesn't feel pity or remorse.

01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:05.137
He does get scared sometimes,

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:07.921
but he absolutely will not stop

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.362
until you are dead.

01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:14.544
What's this got to do with me?

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.409
I know.

01:10:15.922 --> 01:10:17.009
Do you want another cuppa?

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:19.762
Go on then.

01:10:19.793 --> 01:10:20.690
So why the hell am I here?

01:10:20.722 --> 01:10:22.706
Because I'm the only
person he won't kill.

01:10:22.738 --> 01:10:23.762
I mean, go if you want.

01:10:23.793 --> 01:10:24.370
Laters.

01:10:24.401 --> 01:10:26.033
But he'll kill you anyway.

01:10:27.121 --> 01:10:28.402
And why is that?

01:10:28.849 --> 01:10:30.769
Because you're a tit, Richard.

01:10:31.378 --> 01:10:33.010
Right, well, I'm calling the
police.

01:10:33.713 --> 01:10:35.665
That had all my Prince photos on
it.

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:37.106
Leave, and you'll end up like
Ron.

01:10:41.073 --> 01:10:42.577
He's one of the five.

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:43.762
Why Ron?

01:10:44.018 --> 01:10:45.521
He loved being my bitch.

01:10:47.153 --> 01:10:48.306
What is wrong with you?

01:10:48.337 --> 01:10:51.250
Why didn't you put him in the
fire or stab him, shoot him?

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.880
Because he's my best friend.

01:10:52.914 --> 01:10:55.825
Don't be ridiculous, he's
trying to kill all your friends.

01:10:55.857 --> 01:10:56.977
I don't have any other friends.

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:57.937
You've got me.

01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:59.090
Yeah, and you keep slapping me.

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:00.242
Why don't we,

01:11:02.033 --> 01:11:03.026
talk to,

01:11:04.657 --> 01:11:06.962
an Indian spirit chief
or a a voodoo priest?

01:11:07.218 --> 01:11:08.913
It's a two-foot teddy bear,
right?

01:11:09.778 --> 01:11:10.610
One and a half.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.626

get anything we can to defend
ourselves.

Okay, all right, I've got
some water pistols in the car.

What are you gonna do?

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:25.073

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:52.017
Of course.

01:12:53.426 --> 01:12:54.449
Why does he wanna kill me?

01:12:54.482 --> 01:12:56.402
Is it because you think I'm a
tit?

01:12:56.433 --> 01:12:58.226
It's because he's jealous.

01:12:58.257 --> 01:12:59.986
He thinks I love you more than
him.

01:13:01.841 --> 01:13:02.930
Don't worry, he's like that with
everyone.

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:04.049

Don't come out until I say.

01:13:10.706 --> 01:13:12.626
I can look after myself.

just ask yourself, what would

01:14:43.793 --> 01:14:45.457

01:14:57.266 --> 01:14:58.865
Just on another planet.

01:14:58.897 --> 01:15:00.050
He's an actor.
Where have you gone?

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:04.817
Benny loves you.

01:15:11.377 --> 01:15:12.274
Richard!

01:15:12.305 --> 01:15:12.753
It's Reshard.

01:15:12.785 --> 01:15:13.713
The blades!

01:15:16.049 --> 01:15:18.961
Okay, it's just you and me now
buddy.

01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:25.137
Play with Benny.

01:15:35.473 --> 01:15:36.785
AIDS.

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.673
Cuddle Benny.

01:16:20.946 --> 01:16:22.354
Play with Benny.

01:16:27.185 --> 01:16:28.561
Benny loves you.

01:17:13.137 --> 01:17:15.025
Rosko is so last year.

01:17:15.345 --> 01:17:17.233
Oh God noooooo!

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:21.905
Purple Rain. Purple Rain.

01:17:28.753 --> 01:17:29.457
Jack!

01:17:37.297 --> 01:17:40.594
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:17:42.353 --> 01:17:44.914
Okay, no more Mister Nice Guy.

01:17:52.529 --> 01:17:53.745
Okay, okay, I'll be nice.

01:17:53.777 --> 01:17:55.922
I'll. Be. Nice.

01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:12.945
Play with me.
More.

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.066
Come on, Benny.

01:18:38.098 --> 01:18:39.122
Come for Jack.

01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:42.609
Come to Daddy.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.610
There's a good boy.

01:18:57.713 --> 01:19:00.913
I'm not a little girl anymore,
you cheap piece of shit.

01:19:09.329 --> 01:19:11.569
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

01:19:12.754 --> 01:19:15.666
I hate people who say Reshard.

01:19:22.354 --> 01:19:25.074
La la laaaaaa. La la laaaaaa.

01:19:34.866 --> 01:19:36.594
Bon voyage.

01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:12.849
It's Benny.

01:20:17.489 --> 01:20:18.705
Benny loves you.

01:20:19.345 --> 01:20:20.241
Rosko.

01:20:24.433 --> 01:20:25.329
Benny?

01:20:29.137 --> 01:20:30.993
Play with me.

01:20:54.161 --> 01:20:55.442
Brain haemorrhage.

01:21:03.986 --> 01:21:05.393
You're finished.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:26.130
Ta-da.

01:21:38.129 --> 01:21:39.538
Owwwww.

01:21:59.698 --> 01:22:02.353
We know you're in there Jack.
Surrender.

01:22:02.386 --> 01:22:03.889
Richard you tit.

01:22:04.113 --> 01:22:04.913
Tit.

01:22:04.945 --> 01:22:06.833
You're surrounded.

01:22:06.865 --> 01:22:08.082
Surrounded? Idiot.

01:22:08.113 --> 01:22:09.073
Then call it in.

01:22:09.106 --> 01:22:10.801
We don't need armed response.

01:22:12.370 --> 01:22:14.609
We need, these.

01:22:15.026 --> 01:22:15.858
Pellet guns?

01:22:16.786 --> 01:22:17.969
Thank God, we're saved.

01:22:18.609 --> 01:22:22.256
These will take down anyone at
10 paces.

01:22:25.233 --> 01:22:27.602
You go in, I'll cover you.

01:22:27.634 --> 01:22:29.522
No, you go in, I'll cover you.

01:22:29.554 --> 01:22:30.865
With what?

01:22:30.896 --> 01:22:31.474
My batton.

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.354
Take this, take it.

01:22:34.385 --> 01:22:35.825
Fine.

01:22:35.857 --> 01:22:37.553
But, you go in first.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:40.786
What? Oh fuck, all right.

01:22:41.713 --> 01:22:42.898
After three.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:45.456
One.

01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:47.442
Two.

01:22:48.305 --> 01:22:49.136
Three.

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:57.425
What?

01:22:57.458 --> 01:22:58.673
What?

01:22:58.705 --> 01:23:01.010
It's not her you're angry with,
it's me.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.866
I threw you out, I ignored you.

01:23:02.898 --> 01:23:06.034
I fucked up, and I'm
a dick, and I'm sorry.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:07.505
I'm sorry for treating you,

01:23:08.305 --> 01:23:09.425
like a toy.

01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:11.794
Where they're gonna take me,

01:23:12.466 --> 01:23:14.418
you won't be able to come this
time.

01:23:16.466 --> 01:23:17.298
It's over.

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:22.130
Cuddle me.

01:24:33.394 --> 01:24:34.673
Make a wish.

01:24:37.329 --> 01:24:40.946
We'll be friends
forever and ever.

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:52.146
Jack loves you too.

01:25:00.338 --> 01:25:01.169
Benny, no!

01:25:28.753 --> 01:25:30.610
Play with me.

01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:49.361
Benny?

01:26:49.393 --> 01:26:51.090
Benny looovvvees

01:26:51.121 --> 01:26:52.114
yooooou.

01:26:52.146 --> 01:26:53.874
What the fuck was that?

01:26:53.905 --> 01:26:54.961
Call it in.

01:26:54.994 --> 01:26:56.881
Right, you call it in.

01:26:57.137 --> 01:26:57.970
Jack.

01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:00.657
Are you okay?

01:27:00.690 --> 01:27:03.697
We need an ambulance at 415 Elm
Way.

01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:05.746
One suspect down.

01:27:05.777 --> 01:27:07.666
Male, 40, shot and wounded.

01:27:07.697 --> 01:27:08.690
I'm 36.

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:34.481
The sight of the
massacre where

01:27:34.513 --> 01:27:37.745
Reshard Williams killed his
co-workers over a lost promotion

01:27:37.778 --> 01:27:39.921
will be a place of gathering for
family...

01:27:41.266 --> 01:27:42.417
Last lot.

01:27:42.449 --> 01:27:43.825
They're all coming with us.

01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:51.474
Oi, Jack, come
here, you filthy sod.

01:27:52.753 --> 01:27:54.288
My special boy.

01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:04.658
Locked all the doors?

01:28:04.689 --> 01:28:05.426
Check.

01:28:05.457 --> 01:28:06.994
Key under the mat?

01:28:07.025 --> 01:28:07.665
Check.

01:28:07.698 --> 01:28:09.841
Disposed of all the evidence?

01:28:09.874 --> 01:28:10.289
Oh.

01:28:10.322 --> 01:28:11.569
Check.

01:28:12.017 --> 01:28:12.913
Then we're golden.

01:28:12.946 --> 01:28:14.993
Get out of here, before
we change our minds.

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.474
There goes an accessory to
murder.

01:28:19.826 --> 01:28:22.450
Go ahead, tell the truth,
I'll be right behind you.

01:28:23.345 --> 01:28:24.370
Pulling this face.

01:28:28.241 --> 01:28:30.322
Now, I bet you're all wondering

01:28:30.353 --> 01:28:31.921
how the hell we got away with
it.

01:28:31.954 --> 01:28:33.905
But, the real lesson is,

01:28:33.937 --> 01:28:36.625
we've all got that one special
bear,

01:28:36.657 --> 01:28:38.993
someone we've cherished for
years,

01:28:39.026 --> 01:28:41.650
someone that once meant the
world to us.

01:28:41.681 --> 01:28:44.018
Maybe he's tattered from
years of gathering dust.

01:28:44.049 --> 01:28:47.633
Maybe you've found
something else to play with.

01:28:47.666 --> 01:28:51.090
But whatever you do,
under any circumstances,

01:28:51.281 --> 01:28:51.985
Don't.

01:28:52.017 --> 01:28:52.658
Throw.

01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:53.457
Him.

01:28:53.489 --> 01:28:53.937
Out.

01:28:54.353 --> 01:28:56.754
Or the next time you curl up to
sleep,

01:28:56.785 --> 01:28:59.186
he might just come back for a
cuddle.

01:29:05.777 --> 01:29:07.377
You're special.
