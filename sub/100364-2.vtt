last night
to go out on a mission.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.413
You were not supposed
to tend medical care to anyone,

30:26.482 --> 30:28.620
and you most certainly were not
supposed to disregard

30:28.689 --> 30:30.413
the order of a superior officer

30:30.482 --> 30:32.482
and then drug said officer
against their will.

30:35.172 --> 30:37.620
I hate commanding
medical units.

30:37.689 --> 30:41.172
The entitlement doctors and
medics possess drives me crazy.

30:41.241 --> 30:43.344
You're as bad
as the SecCorp guys.

30:43.413 --> 30:44.413
You get away with murder

30:44.482 --> 30:47.068
because you can do
something I can't.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.862
Every time I'm in the OR,

30:48.931 --> 30:51.965
I feel like a goddamn eunuch
at an orgy.

30:52.034 --> 30:53.413
Useless.

30:53.482 --> 30:55.206
And that's not
what I'm used to.

31:01.965 --> 31:03.862
That said,
what you do is important...

31:06.172 --> 31:08.862
Keeping men
like Major Peters alive.

31:08.931 --> 31:10.137
He and I served
in Iraq together.

31:10.206 --> 31:11.482
He's an outstanding warrior.

31:11.551 --> 31:12.931
Heard he may have never
walked again

31:13.000 --> 31:15.034
if you hadn't
brought him in here.

31:15.103 --> 31:17.793
You didn't have to go out
on that mission, but you did.

31:17.862 --> 31:21.034
I respect bravery and a sense
of duty when I see it.

31:22.931 --> 31:25.379
Military needs more
people like you, not less.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.137
- You can see why
I feel in love with this woman.

31:27.206 --> 31:28.965
- Shut the fuck up.

31:29.034 --> 31:30.448
- Yes, sir.

31:41.655 --> 31:43.793
Can't afford to take you
out of commission, Roback.

31:45.206 --> 31:48.482
So I choose to believe
that this is genuine,

31:48.551 --> 31:51.827
that you are both in love,
intending to marry,

31:51.896 --> 31:54.827
and will spend the rest
of your lives together.

31:54.896 --> 31:55.965
- Thank you, sir.

31:56.034 --> 31:57.000
- Always figured
there was something

31:57.068 --> 31:58.206
going on between you two.

31:58.275 --> 31:59.551
- Our love is real, sir.

31:59.620 --> 32:03.379
- Ooh, it better be.

32:03.448 --> 32:05.137
- [clears throat]

32:08.620 --> 32:10.448
- Now I have no idea
if this is gonna keep Alvarez

32:10.517 --> 32:12.068
from losing her MAVNI status...

32:14.310 --> 32:17.620
But guess we'll find out.

32:17.689 --> 32:19.172
Either way,
I'm gonna assign you both

32:19.241 --> 32:21.000
to a communal CHU
once you're married.

32:21.068 --> 32:22.448
Corporal Durkin will help you

32:22.517 --> 32:24.172
fill out the necessary
paperwork for the marriage.

32:24.241 --> 32:25.620
Congratulations.

32:25.689 --> 32:28.241
Forgive me if I don't
get you both a wedding gift.

32:28.310 --> 32:29.275
Get out.

32:29.344 --> 32:31.241
Now.
- Yes, sir.

32:36.275 --> 32:37.655
[clears throat]

32:37.724 --> 32:39.068
We're gonna
need to requisition

32:39.137 --> 32:41.689
a marriage certificate form
so Sergeant Roback--

32:41.758 --> 32:44.482
- Let me take care of this.

32:44.551 --> 32:45.931
I'll catch up with you
in a bit.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
- Okay, sure.

32:52.655 --> 32:55.379
- [chuckles stiffly]

32:55.448 --> 32:57.275
We should probably talk.

32:57.344 --> 32:59.724
- [laughs]

32:59.793 --> 33:01.448
- I knew you'd take this
the right way.

33:01.517 --> 33:03.172
- You really believe
it'll work?

33:03.241 --> 33:05.724
- That's the plan.

33:05.793 --> 33:06.724
- Good luck to you both.

33:06.793 --> 33:08.034
- Thanks.

33:08.103 --> 33:09.551
Now, I've been working
on some new moves

33:09.620 --> 33:11.793
that I am certain will succeed
where others have failed.

33:11.862 --> 33:13.586
- Uh, no.
- What's wrong?

33:13.655 --> 33:14.827
- I'm not fucking
a married man.

33:14.896 --> 33:15.758
- Yeah, but I won't
really be married.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.034
- Yeah, you will.

33:17.103 --> 33:19.103
- Yeah,
but not in the emotional sense.

33:19.172 --> 33:20.413
- In the legal sense.

33:20.482 --> 33:22.172
- Yeah, but I'm only
doing this to help Alvarez

33:22.241 --> 33:23.482
so she doesn't get deported
back to Mexico.

33:23.551 --> 33:26.137
- And that's very sweet.
You're a hell of a friend.

33:26.206 --> 33:28.482
Really, you are,
but you'll still be married.

33:28.551 --> 33:30.862
- Oh, come on.
It'll be awesome.

33:30.931 --> 33:32.275
It might even
make the sex so hot

33:32.344 --> 33:34.000
that I might be able
to finally get you off.

33:34.068 --> 33:35.517

33:35.586 --> 33:37.172
After my dad left my mom
for another woman,

33:37.241 --> 33:39.862
I promised myself
I'd never fuck a married man.

33:39.931 --> 33:41.310
And I meant it.

33:41.379 --> 33:42.655
- Well, how old were you?

33:42.724 --> 33:44.103
- Eight.
- I don't believe this.

33:44.172 --> 33:45.103
- Believe it.

33:45.172 --> 33:46.655
- Well,
then I'll get a divorce

33:46.724 --> 33:48.482
after she establishes
her citizenship.

33:48.551 --> 33:50.379
- All right.
Cool. Yeah. Uh...

33:50.448 --> 33:51.862
- Yeah?
- All right.

33:51.931 --> 33:53.620
See you in a few years.
Let's try to keep in touch.

33:53.689 --> 33:55.068
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, look.

33:55.137 --> 33:56.517
If you're jealous,
there's really no reason to be.

33:56.586 --> 33:57.965
- Jealous?

33:58.034 --> 33:59.517

very emotional right now,

33:59.586 --> 34:00.724
and I get it,

34:00.793 --> 34:02.034
but if you just
think this through,

34:02.103 --> 34:03.275
you'll realize it really
doesn't change anything.

34:03.344 --> 34:04.793
- No, it changes everything.

34:04.862 --> 34:06.724
- I can't back out.
This is my idea.

34:06.793 --> 34:08.379

34:08.448 --> 34:10.793

34:10.862 --> 34:12.379
- Well, don't let me stop you.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.551
- I'm not ready to end this.

34:16.620 --> 34:17.551
- Get ready.

- Wait.

34:23.620 --> 34:24.931
You and I are a lot alike.
