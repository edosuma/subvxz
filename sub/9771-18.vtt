that is not true!

- They're not the same size?!

the same size.

Almost a full size bigger.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.552
- Hello?
- Dean Rivers?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.346
- Why are you sitting with us?

01:36.429 --> 01:38.640
- Zoey, have you heard of
a girl named Paige Howard?

01:38.723 --> 01:40.934
- The girl who won

01:41.017 --> 01:42.769
the National Science Achievement
award this year?

01:42.852 --> 01:44.187
- Exactly.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.064
She's considering switching
schools and coming to PCA.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.150
- Really?
- I'm talking to Zoey.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.485
She's gonna visit here
a few days,

01:50.568 --> 01:54.739
and I want you to be her host--
y'know, show her around,

01:54.823 --> 01:56.366
talk up the school,
that kinda thing.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.868
- Um, sure.
- Well, this is exciting.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.246
I can ask her all about
her proton energy converter.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.790
- Wow, hours
of fun conversation.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.416
- And she's
gonna be installing

02:05.500 --> 02:08.336
her energy converter
thingy here at PCA,

02:08.419 --> 02:12.006
which means that we will be
the first school in the world

02:12.090 --> 02:13.800
running on Paige Power.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.218
- I can't handle
this much excitement.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.392
- Twenty-eight...

02:22.976 --> 02:24.227
Twenty-nine...

02:24.310 --> 02:27.272
- He's almost an hour late!
- I'm aware.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.065
- This is the third time
he's flaked on us.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.441
How many times are we supposed
to put up with him

02:30.525 --> 02:31.568
blowing us off and not even
caring enough--

02:31.651 --> 02:34.279
- What's up, fellas?
Pardon my tardy.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.197
- It's not funny, dude!
We got four days left

02:36.281 --> 02:37.240
to get this psychology
project done,

02:37.323 --> 02:38.741
and we don't
even have an idea.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.202
- I pitched an idea.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.620
- We can't send a bunny
up in a rocket.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.914
- Why not?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.167
- We have no bunny,
we have no rocket,

02:47.250 --> 02:50.211
and it has nothing to
do with psychology.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.297
[cell phone ringing]
- Oh.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.053
Ah ha ha!
It's my baby!

02:59.137 --> 03:01.890
What's up, Lil' Lisa?
- Hang up.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.808
- Okay, yeah,
I'll be there in ten.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.393
All right.
- C'mon, man!

03:05.476 --> 03:07.729
- What? Look, I'll only
be gone ten minutes,

03:07.812 --> 03:10.481
three hours tops.
Sh'loom!

03:14.861 --> 03:15.653
[knock on door]
- Come in.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.239
- Mr. Berringer?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.992
Sorry I'm late. I was in
Dean Rivers' office meeting--

03:21.075 --> 03:23.244
- Paige Howard!
Please, please come in.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.539
- Everyone, this is Paige.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.291
She's from Boulder, Colorado,
and she's thinking

03:28.374 --> 03:29.918
about coming to PCA.
- Hey, guys.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.462
- You better come to PCA.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.924
It would be an absolute honor
to have a scientist

03:36.007 --> 03:38.509
of your caliber
on this campus.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.761
- Oh, stop.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.679
- Hi, Paige.
I'm Quinn Pensky.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.805
- Oh, yeah, I've read
your science blog a few times.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.141
I loved your take

03:45.224 --> 03:46.768
on the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.436
- And the fun begins.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.812
- Okay, uh, Paige,
why don't you just have a seat

03:49.896 --> 03:51.981
next to Zoey?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.484
Quinn here,
if you will, regale us.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.197
- Well, as I was saying,
a geosynchronous satellite

03:59.280 --> 04:01.324
is a satellite whose orbital
track on the earth repeats

04:01.407 --> 04:04.035
regularly over the equator.
- Right, right.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.496
Pretty impressive,
huh, Paige?

04:06.579 --> 04:09.207
- Um...yeah.
Uh-huh.

04:09.290 --> 04:13.002
- Oh...that was not a very
convincing "uh-huh."

04:13.086 --> 04:14.379
Something you wanna share?

04:14.462 --> 04:16.505
- I'm really
just here to watch.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.132
- It's okay, Paige.
You can jump in.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.551
- Um, okay...
Um, actually,

04:20.635 --> 04:23.513
if the satellite's orbit lies
over the equator,

04:23.596 --> 04:26.849
it's technically called
a geostationary satellite.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.394
- Oh. Right.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.520
- But a geostationary
satellite

04:30.603 --> 04:33.231
is a type of
geosynchronous satellite,

04:33.314 --> 04:35.525
so you're pretty much right.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.985
- Thanks.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.071
- Very impressive, Paige.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.323
Kind of makes me wonder
what other wrong things

04:42.407 --> 04:45.284
Quinn has taught us
this semester.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.578
Settle down.
I'm just kidding, Quinn.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.038
- Heh heh...

04:49.122 --> 04:52.166
- Ok, moving on
to Kepler's First Law...

04:53.835 --> 04:55.461
- [laughing]

04:55.545 --> 04:58.298
All right, I'll see you
around seven-thirty.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.633
[kissing sounds]

05:00.717 --> 05:05.263
- Okay, that is like the
biggest fish I've ever seen.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.558
- What fish?
- The one you snagged.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.811
I didn't know you
were a fishing man.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.980
- Okay, I'm so lost.

05:14.063 --> 05:17.692
- The picture--on the student
snapshot board.

05:17.775 --> 05:18.317
Right over here.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.362
See?

05:24.615 --> 05:25.992
- Wh-what's that?

05:26.075 --> 05:27.493
- Hmm. It seems to be
some sort of sea bass.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.537
I'd say somewhere around
seventeen pounds.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.498
How'd you catch it,
Captain Sassy?

05:32.582 --> 05:33.791
- I didn't.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.834
I've never been fishin'
before in my life.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.587
- But the caption says,

05:37.670 --> 05:40.339
"Michael Barret
displays his prized catch."

05:40.423 --> 05:43.509
And that's you
holding a fish.

05:43.593 --> 05:47.930
- I know,
but I don't remember.

05:48.014 --> 05:52.393
Maybe I went on a fishin' trip
and...just forgot about it?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.480
- Um...sure.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.982
- Huh.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.152
MICHAEL :Huh.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.372

06:16.042 --> 06:18.377

'Cause I'm feeling scared.

you're not answering.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.634
So scared.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.676
- Aah!

06:25.760 --> 06:27.053
- Maybe it's time
to give up?

06:27.136 --> 06:28.554
- I'm not giving up.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.598
I've got three months
of my life in this thing,

06:30.681 --> 06:31.724
and it's going to work.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.517
- No one can
defeat gravity, Quinn.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.978
- I can--if I could just...

06:36.062 --> 06:36.521

06:47.990 --> 06:49.534
Uh, give me your cell phone.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.999
Now I activate the electrically

07:13.724 --> 07:16.394

the cell phone destroyer!

07:29.115 --> 07:30.408
- Burning plastic.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.368
Quinn melted my cell phone with
her anti-gravity doo-hickey.

07:32.451 --> 07:35.788
- You built
an anti-gravity chamber?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.248
- Well, not yet.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.959
But it will be as soon
as I figure out how to balance

07:40.042 --> 07:40.710
