How are we still

All I was doing

Mom:
<i>Don't be an ass.</i>
<i>Of course I want him to do it.</i>

<i>Why do you say that?</i>

<i>Tell me your real name.</i>

10:23.873 --> 10:26.668

<i>I can tell.</i>

10:53.528 --> 10:56.698
<i>Thank you for that, Adrienne.</i>

You're welcome.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.120
Friends now?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.872
<i>Yeah, friends.</i>

11:07.750 --> 11:09.878
<i>So what now?</i>

11:12.213 --> 11:16.718
Now we get to have fun.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.386
<i>OK.</i>

11:20.096 --> 11:22.265
I want you to listen to me,

11:22.348 --> 11:25.727

exactly as I say.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.645
<i>OK.</i>

11:27.729 --> 11:29.814
I want you to sit down,

11:29.898 --> 11:32.317

to turn off all the lights.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.444
<i>( light switch flicks off )</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:36.154
Good.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
What?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.955
<i>Are you in the dark, too?</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:48.082
Don't worry about me.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.546
<i>I just wanna know if you'll</i>
<i>be joining me in the dark.</i>

12:10.313 --> 12:14.776
I'm with you... in the dark.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.777
<i>OK.</i>

12:17.779 --> 12:20.490
Now...

12:20.573 --> 12:23.993
I want you to close your eyes,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.120
and I want you to listen to me.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.463
You're at an open house
for a new house that's for sale,

12:35.546 --> 12:38.466
and you don't really like
the house, but your wife does,

12:38.549 --> 12:40.301
so you have to stay.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.557
And you go into the backyard.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.352
There's a shed there.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.772
There's a hot tub inside.

12:52.855 --> 12:58.319
Also, there's another woman
in there... alone.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.198
Her name is Adrienne.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.325
That woman is me.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.581
And you know you should
turn and leave,

13:10.665 --> 13:15.586
but something comes over you
in that moment‐‐

13:15.670 --> 13:19.966
something you don't
understand at all.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.553
And then, on instinct,

13:23.636 --> 13:26.222
you turn and close the door

13:26.305 --> 13:28.182
and lock it.

13:28.266 --> 13:32.186
And I should scream,
but I don't.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.438
I rip my shirt off,

13:33.521 --> 13:34.981
and I look you
in the eye, and I say,

13:35.064 --> 13:39.235
"I want you to grab
my big ol' tits now,"

13:39.318 --> 13:40.945
and we waste no time.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.364
You rip your clothes off,
and I rip mine off,

13:43.448 --> 13:44.949
and we dive into the hot tub,

13:45.033 --> 13:47.118
and you bury your face
in my big ol' tits,

13:47.201 --> 13:50.955
and I say,
"I want you now, George! Now!

13:51.039 --> 13:54.751
I want you to keep going.
Keep going and keep doing me.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.627
Keep grabbing my tits, George.

13:56.711 --> 14:01.674
Keep doing me. Oh, George!
Oh, George! Oh, George!"

14:01.758 --> 14:07.346
<i>Mmm. ( sighing )</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:10.099
<i>( clears throat )</i>

<i>Housekeeping.</i>

14:57.563 --> 14:58.689
( sighs )

14:58.773 --> 15:00.608
<i>Did you call for fresh towels?</i>

15:00.691 --> 15:02.026
No. No, thank you.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.278
<i>( music continues )</i>

15:29.887 --> 15:32.640
( gasps )

15:37.019 --> 15:38.104
Hi, Adrienne.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.778
It's me. I'm here.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.741
Aren't you gonna
rip your shirt off?

15:50.825 --> 15:52.451
Isn't that right?
You're gonna take
your shirt off

15:52.535 --> 15:55.371
and say something like,
"Grab my big ol' tits"?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.664
Something like that.

16:01.961 --> 16:06.174
It was, uh, caller ID.
Got me to the hotel.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.800
You weren't hard to find.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.720
You should close your blinds.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.847
So are you gonna
take your shirt off?

16:16.475 --> 16:19.687
I'll remind you that
you said it wasn't a prank.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.981
You promised.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.567
And I expect you
to follow through
on that promise.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.860
( breathing heavily )

16:35.453 --> 16:40.208
‐ No. No, no, no. No.
‐ ( breathing quickly )

16:43.502 --> 16:45.379
( whimpers )

17:00.436 --> 17:04.565
<i>You are a very,</i>
<i>very lucky girl.</i>

17:04.649 --> 17:09.028
Do you have any idea
what could be happening
in this room tonight?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.905
What could be happening to you?

17:13.574 --> 17:16.827
<i>I bet you make prank calls</i>
<i>all the time, don't you?</i>

17:16.911 --> 17:19.413
And you think you can
just mess with people
and get away with it,

17:19.497 --> 17:25.419
but you are so lucky it was me
on the other end of that line
and not some crazy person.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.426
I want you to look at something.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.886
This is my family.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.556
That's me.
That's my wife, Suzanne.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.350
Those are my daughters.
Claire and Rebecca.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.853
This was taken right down
the road from our house
at First Redeemer Church.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.106
I run the youth league.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.818
I want you to think
about that for a second, OK?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.653
You got me tonight.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.116
A good person. A man of God.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.534
I was on the phone
and I was willing

17:56.617 --> 18:00.246
to just listen to what you
had to say, just hear you.

18:00.329 --> 18:04.542
And I came here to pretend
to do something awful to you

18:04.625 --> 18:08.879
to teach you a lesson
out of the goodness
of my heart...

18:08.963 --> 18:11.591
because I have daughters,
and I don't want them to end up

18:11.674 --> 18:15.595
in a situation like you
could've ended up in tonight.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.471
Do you understand me?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.438
I said, do you understand me?

18:34.530 --> 18:40.494
Hmm. OK. Have it your way.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.497
If you can't
at least be thankful,

18:43.581 --> 18:46.542
I'll at least know I've done
right by your parents tonight,

18:46.626 --> 18:49.670
and I've done right by you,
too, even in you can't see it.

19:16.364 --> 19:21.035
( sighs ) You know,
just a simple thank you

19:21.118 --> 19:25.289
right now would
not be out of line.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.916
You called me, Adrienne.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.169
You started this
with your filthy hot tub talk.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.213
<i>I was at home.</i>

19:32.296 --> 19:34.423
<i>I was watching TV,</i>
<i>I was comfortable,</i>

19:34.507 --> 19:37.468
<i>my family was asleep</i>
<i>in the other room.</i>

19:37.551 --> 19:38.803
I didn't have
to come over here

19:38.886 --> 19:41.639
and do what I did
for you tonight.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.015
I could've just
let you keep going

19:43.099 --> 19:44.517
with your little pranks
until you got yourself

19:44.600 --> 19:49.271
in some really serious trouble,
but I didn't. So?

19:54.026 --> 19:57.238
Unbelievable. I know
that your generation

19:57.321 --> 19:59.156
is used to having everything
just handed to you,

19:59.240 --> 20:02.493
but to not even be able
to summon a simple thank you

20:02.576 --> 20:04.995
in a situation like this‐‐
a situation where, frankly,

20:05.079 --> 20:07.873
there could be
a strange man in this room

20:07.957 --> 20:10.710
doing unspeakable things to you.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.212
<i>Ungodly things.</i>

20:13.295 --> 20:15.673
There could be a man
in this room

20:15.756 --> 20:17.717
with a gun,
pointing it at you,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.721
<i>saying, "if you don't show me</i>
<i>those big ol' tits</i>

20:21.804 --> 20:23.556
in that hot tub over there,

20:23.639 --> 20:28.394
then... then..."

20:36.235 --> 20:38.404
( breathing heavily )

20:53.294 --> 20:55.463
You wanna see
my big ol' tits, George?

20:57.840 --> 21:02.011
No, no. Not me.
I'm a man of God.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.387
<i>I'm talking about other men.</i>

21:03.471 --> 21:04.764
You're not like those men?

21:04.847 --> 21:09.477
No... no, of course not.
Those‐‐ those men are evil.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.896
Those men deserve to die.
They deserve to rot in Hell.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.064
Then why are you staring
at my big ol' tits, George?

21:14.148 --> 21:17.777
‐ I'm not.
‐ <i>Yes. You're staring.</i>

21:17.860 --> 21:20.154
You wanna get me in
that hot tub, don't you, George?

21:20.237 --> 21:22.239
I told you already.
No. Absolutely not.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.909
You are no man of God.
I know what's in your heart.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.535
I am a man of God.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.746
Would a man of God‐‐
would he look at...

21:28.829 --> 21:30.331
these?

21:30.414 --> 21:33.876
Stop that right now,
you filthy little whore.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.711
Do you really want me to stop?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.296
You're just a child‐‐

21:37.379 --> 21:39.757
But isn't that what you
like best about me, George?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.467
Stop. Stop‐‐

21:41.550 --> 21:43.260
You wanna see
my big ol' tits, George.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.470
‐ <i>Don't you do it. Don't do it.</i>
‐ Yeah, you do.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.805
You wanna see my big ol' tits

21:45.888 --> 21:47.473
in that hot tub,
don't you, George?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.141
‐ No! No.
‐ <i>Yes, you do.</i>

21:49.225 --> 21:50.601
You will be no man of God

21:50.684 --> 21:52.436
after you see
my big ol' tits, George.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.938
‐ Our Father...
‐ <i>You don't want to see them?</i>

21:54.021 --> 21:55.606
‐ Hallowed be thy name.
‐ <i>Just look away.</i>

21:55.689 --> 21:57.066
Just look away, George.
It's happening right now!

21:57.149 --> 21:58.734
‐ George, just look away!
‐ <i>Stop it!</i>

21:58.818 --> 22:00.444
‐ No‐‐ ( stammering )
‐ You can't look away, can you?

22:00.528 --> 22:02.780
Because you are no man of God!

22:02.863 --> 22:05.199
‐ You are the devil!
‐ I'm not the devil!
