Look at you. You don't even know
how beautiful you are.

00:22.804 --> 00:24.438
That's what makes you
so beautiful.

00:24.472 --> 00:26.707
Well, I heard that turkey's
had a ton of work done.

00:26.708 --> 00:30.111
Had his head chopped off,
skin removed, big ol' boobs...

Don't worry about the Europeans.

00:37.219 --> 00:39.153
They're fine.
They've got tapas. And Belgium.

00:39.154 --> 00:41.222
And Leonardo DiCaprio,
eight months out of the year.

00:41.256 --> 00:42.890
Okay, turkey's in.

00:42.891 --> 00:44.458
Now time to make
everything else.

00:44.459 --> 00:46.260
Potatoes, hello,
good to see you.

00:46.261 --> 00:48.295
Carrots, you're gonna be...
pretty good.

00:48.296 --> 00:50.631
I mean, you're not potatoes,
but you're fine.

00:50.665 --> 00:52.900
Would you say
Dad and Thanksgiving

00:52.901 --> 00:55.302
sitting in a tree,
K-I-S-S-I-N-G?

00:55.337 --> 00:57.438
I would kiss Thanksgiving,
Louise.

00:57.439 --> 00:59.540
Its kiss would be salty
and delicious.

00:59.574 --> 01:00.641
Like a mermaid.

01:00.675 --> 01:01.809
Okay, I better go get Gayle

01:01.810 --> 01:03.244
before I forget to get Gayle.

01:03.278 --> 01:04.845
Mwah. Why can't
she drive herself?

01:04.846 --> 01:06.847
Come on, Bob.
She sprained her ankle.

01:06.848 --> 01:08.249
She says she can't drive.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.117
She also said
she can't use toothpaste

01:10.118 --> 01:12.119
because she's afraid
she'll get addicted.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.488
Bob. Fine.
But I should get her, Lin.

01:14.489 --> 01:16.323
It's really snowy out.
So?

01:16.324 --> 01:19.760
Uh, remember the last time
you drove our car in the snow?

01:19.795 --> 01:21.128
(all screaming)

01:21.129 --> 01:23.164
Oh, no!
(screaming)

01:23.198 --> 01:24.231
Oh. Oh, right.

01:24.266 --> 01:25.366
How'd she sprain her ankle?

01:25.367 --> 01:26.634
She said she slipped on salsa

01:26.635 --> 01:28.169
while she was salsa dancing.

01:28.203 --> 01:29.937
Poor Gayle.
And to make it worse,

01:29.938 --> 01:32.239
she's down in the dumps
'cause Mr. Frond dumped her.

01:32.274 --> 01:34.375
I know just the guy
to set her up with.

01:34.376 --> 01:36.444
Oh, wait, I was thinking
of Mr. Frond. Never mind.

01:36.478 --> 01:37.444
All right.
So who wants to come with me?

01:37.479 --> 01:39.346
What?! It's snowing!

01:39.381 --> 01:41.649
Yeah. You're a kid.
Kids love snow.

01:41.683 --> 01:43.284
Take it easy, Norman Rockwell.

01:43.285 --> 01:44.752
I'm more into rain now.

01:44.786 --> 01:46.454
Fine. I'll go by myself,
but just...

01:46.455 --> 01:48.155
no one touch anything
while I'm gone.

01:48.156 --> 01:49.523
Stay away from the oven.

01:49.558 --> 01:52.159
Calm down. No one wants
to cook, you weirdo.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.895
If anything happens, don't call
AAA, because we don't have them

01:54.896 --> 01:56.820
and we owe them money
from when we did!

01:56.832 --> 01:58.199
(horn honks)

01:58.200 --> 01:59.500
ANNOUNCER: I hope
you're over the river

01:59.501 --> 02:01.035
and through the woods to
Grandmother's house already,

02:01.036 --> 02:04.138
because we're looking at a nasty
Thanksgiving blizzard, folks.

02:04.139 --> 02:06.207
Stay off the roads.

02:06.241 --> 02:08.642
You stay off the roads.
(chuckles)

02:08.643 --> 02:09.643
Come on, Gayle.

02:09.644 --> 02:10.610
(horn honks)

02:10.645 --> 02:12.747
Gayle? It's me, Bob.

02:12.748 --> 02:15.349
Your five locks were unlocked,
so I'm-I'm coming in.

02:15.383 --> 02:17.485
I'm not a murderer. And if
there's a murderer in here,

02:17.486 --> 02:18.819
uh, don't murder me.

02:18.820 --> 02:20.154
GAYLE: Bob? Is that you?

02:20.155 --> 02:21.756
Yep. Uh, car's out front

02:21.757 --> 02:23.824
and it's really coming down,
so we-we need...

02:23.859 --> 02:25.559
I'm in the bathroom.
I need help.

02:25.594 --> 02:27.228
Oh. Uh, great.

02:27.229 --> 02:30.331
I'll just come into the bathroom
where you are

02:30.332 --> 02:32.533
to help with...
whatever you need.

02:34.936 --> 02:36.704
I fell when I was
getting out of the shower,

02:36.705 --> 02:38.339
and I can't stand back up.

02:38.373 --> 02:41.075
Oh, okay. Let me just...
Um, give me your hand.

02:42.444 --> 02:44.779
(shouting) Come on, Gayle!

02:44.780 --> 02:47.448
Oh, calm down, Bob.
It's just my breasts.

02:47.449 --> 02:49.450
And if something happens
between us, it happens.

02:49.451 --> 02:51.085
Gayle, nothing is gonna happen.

02:51.086 --> 02:53.454
Well, not with
that attitude it won't.

02:53.455 --> 02:54.955
Hand me the shirt, Bob.

02:54.956 --> 02:56.957
Okay, is it on yet?
No.

02:56.958 --> 02:58.859
Okay. Now?
No, not yet.

02:58.860 --> 03:01.062
Gayle, why is it taking you
so long to put a shirt on?

03:01.063 --> 03:03.063
Your arms aren't sprained.
Okay, it's on.

03:03.064 --> 03:05.066
No. No, wait. Okay, now. Mm.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.735
No. Hold on.
Please put it on. Gail.

03:07.736 --> 03:09.403
Great. You look great.
So let's go.

03:09.404 --> 03:10.971
I just need to find my cats.

03:10.972 --> 03:12.706
I can't leave 'em
here alone. What?

03:12.741 --> 03:14.475
No, no, no. We're not
taking them to my house.

03:14.476 --> 03:15.543
I-I'm allergic.

03:15.577 --> 03:17.645
But Mr. Business
is hypoglycemic!

03:17.646 --> 03:19.580
He has to eat something
every two hours

03:19.581 --> 03:21.415
or he gets real lethargic.

03:21.450 --> 03:24.251
Fine, bring him. If it'll get us
out of here faster, bring him.

03:24.252 --> 03:26.053
I just won't breathe today,
I guess.

03:26.054 --> 03:27.288
Okay.

03:27.289 --> 03:29.557
Mr. Business! Mr. B...

03:29.591 --> 03:31.058
Oh, there he is, up there.

03:31.093 --> 03:32.593
Bob, can you get him?
He'll jump down

03:32.594 --> 03:34.328
if you sing to him
and pat your shoulders.

03:34.329 --> 03:35.328
Oh, my God.

03:35.330 --> 03:36.964
Okay, um...

03:36.998 --> 03:39.100
(humming)

03:39.101 --> 03:41.168
No, no, no. Something
with a little rhythm.

03:41.169 --> 03:42.636
It's got to be jazzy.

03:42.637 --> 03:44.905
(sighs)
Okay. All right, all right.

03:44.906 --> 03:47.641
(singing scat)

03:47.642 --> 03:49.410
GAYLE: There you go.

03:49.444 --> 03:50.975
(continues singing scat)

03:50.979 --> 03:52.646
Oh, look at him, he loves it.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.248
Ow! Ow! (sneezes)
You did it, Bob.

03:54.282 --> 03:55.583
Good job.
Oh!

03:55.617 --> 03:56.784
Ow.
Put him in this box.

03:56.785 --> 03:57.885
Here, here.
Okay.

03:57.919 --> 03:59.120
Now, tape it shut.

03:59.121 --> 04:00.588
With what tape?
I don't have tape!

04:00.589 --> 04:02.590
Why are you being so negative?
Oh, my God.

04:02.591 --> 04:04.425
(yowling) Ow!

04:04.426 --> 04:05.793
I'll find some tape.

04:05.827 --> 04:07.995
(grunting)

04:07.996 --> 04:10.164
(screams) What are you doing?!

04:10.198 --> 04:13.401
I'm making a salad.
I told Linda I'd bring one.

04:13.435 --> 04:15.336
You were supposed to be
getting tape, Gayle!

04:15.370 --> 04:17.538
I didn't want to make two trips!

04:17.539 --> 04:19.540
Don't worry about it.
He's fine in there.

04:19.541 --> 04:21.308
(Mr. Business yowls)
He likes it.

04:21.309 --> 04:23.544
Okay, let me just find
my house keys.

04:23.545 --> 04:25.613
They're all separate
and not on one ring.

04:25.647 --> 04:27.214
(annoyed chuckle)

04:27.215 --> 04:29.483
Okay, car's not snowed in.
That's good.

04:29.484 --> 04:31.652
(horn honking) Let's get go...
No, no, no, no.

04:31.653 --> 04:34.355
No!
No!

04:34.389 --> 04:38.526
I left the Thanksgiving megamix
I made in the CD-ROM drive!

04:41.645 --> 04:43.680
Ugh. Okay.
Gayle, do you have a shovel?

04:43.681 --> 04:44.681
No.

04:44.682 --> 04:45.949
Uh, a bucket?
No.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.150
Okay. Um, a bowl?

04:47.151 --> 04:48.952
Uh... no.

04:48.953 --> 04:51.287
Well, the one the salad is in,
but I don't have any others.

04:51.288 --> 04:52.522
You only have one bowl?

04:52.523 --> 04:53.656
I'm not rich, Bob.

04:53.657 --> 04:55.291
(groans) Ooh!

04:55.292 --> 04:57.360
But I do have a whole
bunch of kitty poop scoops.

04:57.361 --> 04:59.462
Would those work?
Not really.

04:59.463 --> 05:01.331
Okay, just give 'em...
Here's one. Here's my good one.

05:01.332 --> 05:03.500
That's fine. Here's the purple one.
I hate this one.

05:03.501 --> 05:05.135
I feel like it's
making fun of me.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.341
Lin, hi. No, no, no.

05:11.342 --> 05:13.676
We're fine. Just... the car
is buried in the snow.

05:13.677 --> 05:16.246
How's the turkey? I mean,
how are you and the kids?

05:16.247 --> 05:18.081
We're doing good.
Everyone's good.

05:18.082 --> 05:19.516
We're making up cuss words.

05:19.517 --> 05:21.518
Listen to this: aw, finky!

05:21.519 --> 05:24.666
That's great. Listen, we're in
a little bit of a situation here.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.589
Uh, the car is buried
and I'm poop-scooping it out,

05:27.590 --> 05:29.917
but it's gonna take a little
while, so I'm gonna need you

05:29.918 --> 05:31.552
to baste the turkey.

05:31.553 --> 05:33.687
Wait, wait. You want...
you want me to do what?

05:33.688 --> 05:35.722
Don't worry, you can do it.
It's gonna be fine.

05:35.723 --> 05:37.558
Just keep it moist
until I get home.

05:37.559 --> 05:39.993
But, Bob, you always
cook the turkey!

05:39.994 --> 05:41.662
Just relax, all right?

05:41.663 --> 05:44.064
Get out the baster.
Tell him not to worry.

05:44.065 --> 05:46.834
He'll probably be confused,
'cause he's so used to my voice.

05:46.835 --> 05:48.569
Then get some juice from the pan

05:48.570 --> 05:50.504
and, you know,
squirt it on the turkey.

05:50.505 --> 05:52.206
That's what basting is?

05:52.207 --> 05:53.874
J-Just tell the turkey
I'm on my way.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.409
Uh, o-okay, okay, bye.

05:55.410 --> 05:57.377
All right, just tell him now
so I can hear you say it,

05:57.378 --> 05:59.246
'cause I want him... I want
to hear what he says.

05:59.247 --> 06:01.515
I'm hanging up! I got to go!
Bye! Yep. All right. Bye.

06:01.516 --> 06:03.851
(line ringing) TEDDY:
Bob, happy Thanksgiving.

06:03.852 --> 06:05.385
Teddy, great.
I-I need your help.

06:05.386 --> 06:06.854
My car is snowed in
at Gayle's apartment.

06:06.855 --> 06:08.455
Is there any chance
you could pick us up

06:08.456 --> 06:10.324
in your truck
and take us to my house?

06:10.358 --> 06:12.793
I wish I could help you, Bob,
but my truck's in the shop.

06:12.794 --> 06:15.028
I've been biking everywhere,
like they do in China.

06:15.063 --> 06:16.430
Wait, you've been biking?

06:16.464 --> 06:18.465
Well, I biked to one place.
It was horrible.

06:18.466 --> 06:20.234
Also, I'm on a cruise.
What?!

06:20.235 --> 06:22.236
Yep. Me and Mom.
It's a singles cruise.

06:22.237 --> 06:24.905
Uh, sock's on the door.
I can't go in.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.241
Guess it's back to the buffet.
(grumbles)

06:27.275 --> 06:28.442
A-All right. Thanks, Teddy.

06:28.443 --> 06:29.710
I'm having a terrible time, Bob.

06:29.711 --> 06:31.311
Uh, I got to go.

06:31.312 --> 06:33.547
I don't think my mom
respects herself. Bye.

06:33.581 --> 06:35.682
All right, Gayle,
we're gonna go on foot.

06:35.717 --> 06:37.551
But, Bob, I can't.
My ankle.

06:37.552 --> 06:39.219
Damn it.
Right, I forgot.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.888
You go. Just leave me here.

06:40.889 --> 06:42.289
Okay. Bye.

06:42.290 --> 06:43.524
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! What?

06:43.558 --> 06:45.125
Bob, I just had a great idea.

06:45.126 --> 06:47.794
Piggyback. Come over here.
Crouch down.

06:47.795 --> 06:50.464
No. Gayle, I can't carry you.
It's too far.

06:50.465 --> 06:52.366
But maybe I could drag you.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.601
What's that?
It's a kiddie pool.

06:54.602 --> 06:57.171
It's so I can shave
my legs while I watch TV.

06:57.172 --> 06:58.505
It distracts me from the pain.

06:58.506 --> 07:00.274
I buy very cheap razors.

07:00.275 --> 07:02.442
(quietly): Uh, it's so sad here.
What was that?

07:02.443 --> 07:04.978
Nothing, I...
I'm just thinking of a plan.

07:05.013 --> 07:06.080
♪ ♪

07:06.114 --> 07:07.815
(blowing)

07:12.187 --> 07:13.620
All right, snowstorm.

07:13.621 --> 07:16.323
You thought you could beat me,
but you can't!

07:16.357 --> 07:18.525
Hang on, little turkey!
Here I come!

07:18.526 --> 07:20.093
Bob, were you talking to me?

07:20.128 --> 07:22.663
Forget it, Gayle.
Just sit there. Okay.

07:22.664 --> 07:24.498
We'll be there in no time.

07:24.532 --> 07:26.533
Or, like, three hours,
probably. Maybe four.

07:26.534 --> 07:27.668
I should call Linda.

07:27.669 --> 07:29.203
Mm. I'm not comfortable.

07:29.204 --> 07:30.704
Gayle, no talking right now.

07:30.705 --> 07:32.639
Walking? Bob, you're nuts!

07:32.640 --> 07:35.509
Please don't freeze to death
in the snow, on Thanksgiving.

07:35.543 --> 07:38.779
Oh, I'll be so embarrassed if
Dad publicly freezes to death.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.781
I hope he freezes
with a thumbs-up.

07:40.782 --> 07:43.117
That'd be one cool ice cube.

07:43.118 --> 07:45.119
Lin, I promise
we're not gonna die,

07:45.120 --> 07:46.854
but it's gonna take a long time.

07:46.888 --> 07:49.156
I think you're gonna have
to cook the whole turkey

07:49.157 --> 07:50.591
and make the sides, too.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.360
What? What? What, what?
I'm not gonna cry.

07:53.361 --> 07:55.028
It-It's gonna be okay.
The turkey's gonna be fine.

07:55.063 --> 07:57.498
Bob, I just got used
to being a baster!

07:57.499 --> 08:00.134
I'm a baster! I-I mean,
I-I haven't done it yet,

08:00.135 --> 08:01.435
but I was just about to.

08:01.469 --> 08:03.537
Linda, nobody wants this
to be happening,

08:03.538 --> 08:04.872
but we're gonna get through it.

08:04.873 --> 08:06.540
Now, listen very carefully...

08:06.541 --> 08:08.905
Actually, you got to write
all this down.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.390
(gasping) All right, you ready?

08:10.391 --> 08:12.325
Okay.
It's a 16-pound turkey.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.861
I was expecting to cook it in
three-and-a-half hours. Uh...

08:14.862 --> 08:17.330
You need to baste it
every 45 minutes. (exhales)

08:17.331 --> 08:19.332
And in about half an hour,
you need to start checking

08:19.333 --> 08:22.068
the internal temperature.
Use the meat thermometer. Oh...

08:22.069 --> 08:24.270
You need to check it in at
least three places: (panting)

08:24.271 --> 08:26.506
the breast, the outer thigh,
Uh... uh...

08:26.507 --> 08:28.007
and then the inner thigh.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.842
It needs to be 165 degrees

08:29.843 --> 08:31.844
by the time it finishes cooking.
Uh-huh...

08:31.845 --> 08:34.179
If it starts to dry out before
it reaches that temperature,

08:34.181 --> 08:35.682
(panting) you must
tent it with foil.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.116
Okay, okay.
Let me find a pen!

08:37.116 --> 08:38.784
What?! No, no, no,
I got it, I got it!

08:38.785 --> 08:40.586
I'll get the kids to help me.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.921
I'll get the kids. Yeah, yeah.
No. No, no, no, no.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.423
No, no, don't do that.
Okay, bye!

08:43.424 --> 08:45.191
Don't hang up! Lin! Lin!

08:45.192 --> 08:47.527
Kids, listen up! Your father
is pulling your aunt

08:47.528 --> 08:49.362
through the snow
because he's a hero.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.864
We're all gonna have to cook
stuff. Gene, green beans!

08:51.865 --> 08:54.300
Is that my new name?
It's your name, and it's your job!

08:54.301 --> 08:56.202
Louise, mashed potatoes
and carrots.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.870
Gene, I'm trading you.
Never!

08:57.871 --> 09:00.406
And, Tina, you're on Team Turkey
with me, baby.

09:00.441 --> 09:02.842
So it's me, you and the turkey
against Gene and Louise?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.444
No. I mean, sure.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.579
Shove it, sides.
Tina, focus.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.715
Your father just said a bunch of
stuff that I didn't write down.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.917
Call him back.
No, no, no, no, no. We got it.

09:10.918 --> 09:11.984
W-We'll look it up.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.625
Hey, is there... is
there any more room on

09:13.654 --> 09:15.054
Team Sides?
Tina! Look at me!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.055
We can do this.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.390
Right, right, right, right.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.326
I think we're making
really good time.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.395
I bet we've gone
at least a mile.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.931
Hey, maybe I'll enter
that dogsled race in Alaska.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.666
Those dogs think
they're so great,

09:26.667 --> 09:28.468
but wait
till they get a load of me.

09:28.502 --> 09:31.070
That's right, Bob.
I can't hear you very well,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.072
but you seem happy.
Oh, my God.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.475
Is this the dry cleaners
at the end of your block?

09:35.509 --> 09:37.777
Yes! (groans) I went
the wrong way.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.113
Everything looks
the same in the snow.

09:40.114 --> 09:42.348
Well, at least you're getting
some exercise, Bob.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.651
Yeah. Good. Great.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.252
Here's what I'm thinking.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.421
I'm gonna take my side
in a dessert direction.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.590
Perhaps a jelly bean,
green bean casserole

09:50.591 --> 09:52.425
without the casserole?
Yeah.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.827
And the problem with most sides
is that they aren't dessert.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.796
Okay, Mom, I think it's
time to start taking

09:56.797 --> 09:58.197
temperature readings.
Okay.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.465
And it says here we need
to check the temperature

09:59.466 --> 10:01.568
of the stuffing, too.
What?

10:01.602 --> 10:04.270
The turkey juice gets absorbed
by the stuffing in the cavity.

10:04.305 --> 10:05.972
Uh-oh!
And if it's not hot enough,

10:05.973 --> 10:07.807
it can lead to salmonella!
Oh, my God!

10:07.808 --> 10:09.809
Nine million people die
each year from stuffing!

10:09.843 --> 10:12.478
No!
Sorry, nine. But still.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.880
(grunts) (beeping)

10:13.881 --> 10:15.982
Oh, Bob, my alarm just beeped.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.384
Time to take a break
and let Mr. Business eat.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.321
W-Well, you can feed him.
You're sitting. You're there.

10:21.322 --> 10:23.022
I'm... I'll keep pulling.
We got to go.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.691
No, he gets carsick!

10:24.725 --> 10:27.327
Fine, Gayle. Just please try
to make it fast, okay?

10:27.328 --> 10:29.028
But maybe don't open the box
so much bec...

10:29.029 --> 10:30.463
Oh, it's fine, Bob.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.032
Time to eat, my little
low-blood-sugar booger.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.301
No, Gayle, he's getting out!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

10:35.336 --> 10:36.669
No!

10:36.704 --> 10:38.371
GAYLE: No...!

10:39.950 --> 10:43.903
(screaming) Gayle! Gayle!

10:43.904 --> 10:45.538
Gayle!
What?!

10:45.572 --> 10:46.772
Calm down.

10:46.807 --> 10:48.374
You have to find my cat!

10:48.408 --> 10:50.409
Okay, look, I'm sure
he didn't go that far.

10:50.410 --> 10:51.777
We can... We'll get him.

10:51.778 --> 10:53.512
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

10:53.547 --> 10:55.748
Bob, don't talk down to him.
Oh, my God.

10:55.749 --> 10:57.883
All right.
Here, Mr. Business!

10:57.884 --> 10:59.752
Good Mr. Business!

10:59.753 --> 11:02.955
Use his full name.
It's Jim. Mr. Jim Business.

11:02.989 --> 11:04.557
Oh, uh, why don't
you call him, then?

11:04.591 --> 11:07.059
Oh, please.
He hates the sound of my voice.

11:07.094 --> 11:09.261
Oh... my God.

11:09.296 --> 11:10.963
Tina, write this
down. Breast, 125.

11:10.964 --> 11:12.465
Okay.

11:12.499 --> 11:14.967
Uh, thigh, 100 and,
uh, call it 20. Okay.

11:14.968 --> 11:17.136
Uh, this part, 100 and,
uh, I can't read it.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.370
Got it.

11:18.405 --> 11:19.638
Mom, quit poking the poultry.

11:19.639 --> 11:21.107
You're gonna let
all the air out.

11:21.108 --> 11:22.808
Just put your hand
on its forehead.

11:22.843 --> 11:24.977
Oh, my God, this one's 400.
Forget it.

11:24.978 --> 11:26.312
F-Forget that one.
Okay.

11:26.346 --> 11:28.347
That looks right.

11:28.348 --> 11:31.117
You say potato, I say
hot fudge potato sundae.

11:31.118 --> 11:33.285
Well, we do not have
enough jelly beans to make

11:33.286 --> 11:36.856
Gene's jelly bean casserole,
but luckily we have gummy worms,

11:36.857 --> 11:38.858
chocolate chips,
and who's this little guy?

11:38.859 --> 11:41.427
One peanut butter Thundergirl
cookie from last year?

11:41.428 --> 11:42.895
How did you escape?

11:42.896 --> 11:44.964
Die, die, die!

11:44.965 --> 11:47.700
Mr. Business!
Mr. Jim Business!

11:47.701 --> 11:50.403
Wait, Bob, here.
This is his collar.

11:50.437 --> 11:52.171
We must be going the right way.

11:52.172 --> 11:53.639
He's leaving us clues.

11:53.674 --> 11:55.474
Fine, but... (screams)

11:55.475 --> 11:58.010
Bob? You okay?
Looks like you fell down.

11:58.044 --> 12:01.280
I did, Gayle. I did.
I need a quick break.

12:01.314 --> 12:03.015
No. All right. You're right.

12:03.016 --> 12:05.117
I got to keep going.
We got to keep moving.

12:05.118 --> 12:06.352
That's the spirit, Bob!

12:06.353 --> 12:07.620
All right, I'm getting up.

12:07.621 --> 12:08.854
Up and at 'em, Bob!

12:08.855 --> 12:10.956
Here we go, we're doing this!

12:10.957 --> 12:12.458
Bob? Where are you, Bob?

12:12.459 --> 12:13.693
(muffled): I'm here.

12:13.694 --> 12:15.528
In the snow?
Yes.

12:15.562 --> 12:16.829
In the snow.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.731
We're not gonna make it, are we?

12:18.732 --> 12:20.032
I don't know, Gayle.

12:20.033 --> 12:21.801
I think I just need
to rest for a minute.

12:21.802 --> 12:23.002
Get my strength back.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.704
You want a little salad, Bob?

12:24.705 --> 12:26.238
No. No salad.

12:26.239 --> 12:27.506
Okay, fine.
Maybe a little.

12:27.507 --> 12:28.741
Here you go.
Mm.

12:28.742 --> 12:30.142
What kind of dressing is this?

12:30.143 --> 12:31.510
There's no dressing.

12:31.511 --> 12:33.012
Something must have
dripped in it.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.647
Oh! (spitting)

12:34.648 --> 12:35.881
Tell me a story, Bob.

12:35.882 --> 12:37.149
Not right now, Gayle.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.818
Okay, I'll tell one.

12:38.819 --> 12:41.053
Once there was a movie
called <i> You've Got Mail.</i>

12:41.054 --> 12:42.288
Please, no.

12:42.322 --> 12:44.357
Oh, my God!
This side is brown.

12:44.358 --> 12:45.858
This side is raw.

12:45.859 --> 12:47.393
I'm getting readings
all over the place!

12:47.394 --> 12:48.761
This oven sucks!

12:48.762 --> 12:50.429
All right,
you know what we got to do?

12:50.430 --> 12:51.731
We got to turn this bird.

12:51.732 --> 12:53.432
Tina, mitt me.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.334
Okay, here we go.

12:55.335 --> 12:57.870
Just gonna grab the legs
and give her a gentle...

12:57.871 --> 12:59.105
Oh, God!

12:59.106 --> 13:01.207
(Tina and Louise scream)
You monster!

13:01.241 --> 13:02.842
Do you think your dad'll notice?

13:02.876 --> 13:05.344
Oh, now he's <i> my</i> dad?
Ah, it's fine.

13:05.345 --> 13:07.279
Tell him the turkey
was playing with fireworks.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.682
It's amazing what they can do
with prosthetics these days.

13:09.716 --> 13:11.784
No. You know what?
Gene, get me a needle.

13:11.785 --> 13:14.086
Tina, get me some thread.
Louise, get me a drink.

13:14.087 --> 13:16.422
Everybody scrub in for
turkey surgery, stat!

13:16.423 --> 13:18.591
(sighs)
Uh, just a few more minutes,

13:18.592 --> 13:20.593
then I'll be ready to go.

13:20.594 --> 13:22.094
I'm freezing.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.230
Aren't we supposed
to share body heat?

13:24.231 --> 13:27.066
Uh, I guess
we could, uh, huddle.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.567
For warmth.

13:28.568 --> 13:30.903
(grunts) Okay. Ooh.

13:30.904 --> 13:33.472
Oh. That's actually
a lot warmer.

13:33.473 --> 13:34.940
I drink a lot of soup.

13:34.941 --> 13:37.243
By the way, thank you, Bob.

13:37.244 --> 13:40.746
I really appreciate everything
you've been doing for me today.

13:40.747 --> 13:42.548
I know you don't like me.

13:42.549 --> 13:44.884
What? No. No, no, I-I...

13:44.885 --> 13:46.485
It's okay. I know
I'm a little...

13:46.486 --> 13:47.787
eccentric.
Crazy?

13:47.788 --> 13:49.455
Eccentric.
That's what I said.

13:49.456 --> 13:50.957
And I've been a little moody.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.625
I didn't notice.

13:52.626 --> 13:56.095
It's just, sometimes you
meet a guy who likes cats

13:56.096 --> 13:59.165
and has great armpits,
and then next thing you know,

13:59.166 --> 14:00.967
he leaves you high and dry.

14:00.968 --> 14:02.468
Are you talking about Mr. Frond?

14:02.469 --> 14:04.270
I mean, you probably
call him Phillip.

14:04.271 --> 14:05.638
No, I call him Mr. Frond.

14:05.639 --> 14:08.474
Look, Gayle,
I mean, you're... you.

14:08.475 --> 14:09.475
I am?

14:09.476 --> 14:10.476
Yes. Definitely.

14:10.477 --> 14:11.744
You're right.

14:11.745 --> 14:13.246
Yeah. I know.

14:13.247 --> 14:15.114
And that's...
there's something about that.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.115
That's something.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.616
Yes. And you're gonna

14:17.617 --> 14:19.518
meet someone
who's-who's right for you.

14:19.519 --> 14:22.188
I mean, the Internet is... vast.

14:22.189 --> 14:25.324
That's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

14:25.325 --> 14:26.926
May I fart?

14:26.927 --> 14:28.628
Hmm?
I have to fart,

14:28.629 --> 14:30.263
but I... we're huddled, so...

14:30.264 --> 14:31.764
Yeah, I'd rather you didn't.
(farts)

14:31.765 --> 14:33.966
Oh. Oh. There you go.
You-you just did.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.434
I did.
Yup.

14:35.435 --> 14:36.702
(farts) I did it again.

14:36.703 --> 14:38.004
Yeah, I heard that one.

14:38.005 --> 14:39.772
Uh-huh.
Um...

14:39.773 --> 14:42.942
Oh. It's stuck down
in my snowsuit. Oh.

14:42.943 --> 14:45.645
That one is... whew...
coming up around my neck.

14:45.679 --> 14:47.613
(gasps) Mr. Business!

14:47.614 --> 14:49.949
Gayle!
Wait, how are you running?

14:49.950 --> 14:52.184
With my legs!
I mean, oh, ow.

14:52.185 --> 14:53.519
Ow, it hurts.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.854
You aren't hurt!

14:54.855 --> 14:56.622
You were faking it!

14:56.623 --> 14:59.125
Fine. I was faking it
for attention.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.494
What?! Are you serious?!

15:01.495 --> 15:02.995
You ruined
my Thanksgiving dinner

15:02.996 --> 15:04.664
because you wanted attention?!

15:04.698 --> 15:06.632
No, I ruined
your Thanksgiving dinner

15:06.633 --> 15:08.401
because I wanted attention!

15:08.402 --> 15:11.133
Oh, wait, is that what you said?
Oh. Yes!

15:13.074 --> 15:15.375
Mr. Business! Gayle,
I can't believe you lied to me!

15:15.376 --> 15:16.910
You let me drag you for miles

15:16.911 --> 15:18.679
and you could walk
the whole time?!

15:18.680 --> 15:20.881
Gayle, you're getting
really far away.

15:20.882 --> 15:22.949
I want to yell at you,
so please stop running.

15:22.950 --> 15:23.950
No!

15:23.951 --> 15:25.786
I'm going after my baby!

15:25.787 --> 15:27.087
He's all I have left!

15:27.088 --> 15:29.222
Except for my other two cats!

15:29.223 --> 15:30.724
(panting)

15:30.725 --> 15:32.225
Gayle!

15:32.226 --> 15:34.561
Oh, God. So tired.

15:34.562 --> 15:35.595
So old.

15:35.596 --> 15:36.730
(phone rings)

15:36.731 --> 15:38.231
Everything's fine!
What?

15:38.232 --> 15:39.933
Everything's fine.
Turkey's great.

15:39.934 --> 15:41.568
I just want know how
far away you are.

15:41.569 --> 15:43.036
But everything's fine.
Okay.

15:43.037 --> 15:44.705
Well, uh, funny story.

15:44.706 --> 15:47.407
Your sister got loose
and chased her cat down the street.

15:47.408 --> 15:49.109
And, uh, now I can't see her.

15:49.110 --> 15:50.711
What? You lost her?

15:50.712 --> 15:52.946
Bob, it's a blizzard out
there. She could die!

15:52.947 --> 15:55.382
It's not my fault, Linda.
She ran away from me.

15:55.383 --> 15:57.751
She ran, Lin.
On her foot.

15:57.752 --> 16:00.554
It's not hurt.
She faked her ankle injury.

16:00.555 --> 16:02.956
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she does that.

16:02.957 --> 16:04.825
Wait, what? You knew?

16:04.826 --> 16:07.761
No. No, I didn't know for sure,
but she does it sometimes.

16:07.762 --> 16:09.229
Lin, I've been pulling her
through the snow

16:09.230 --> 16:11.064
for the past three hours!

16:11.065 --> 16:14.434
Look, look, look, she's just
upset because of Mr. Frond.

16:14.435 --> 16:16.436
What does that have
to do with her ankle?

16:16.437 --> 16:18.939
Oh, she fakes injuries
when she's sad.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.274
Or when she's happy.
Or bored. Or injured.

16:21.275 --> 16:23.143
Oh, Lin, I hate your sister.

16:23.144 --> 16:25.012
No, you don't.
You love her.

16:25.013 --> 16:26.580
She's family, Bob.

16:26.581 --> 16:28.949
She's <i> your</i> family, Lin.
You married me.

16:28.950 --> 16:31.585
That makes her your family
whether you like it or not.

16:31.586 --> 16:33.954
I don't... like it.
You go find her, Bob.

16:33.955 --> 16:35.188
But take your time.
Take your time. (electric whirring)

16:35.189 --> 16:36.356
What?
Everything's fine.

16:36.357 --> 16:37.958
Why'd you say "Take your time"?

16:37.959 --> 16:40.227
And what's that noise?
What noise? Uh, shh.

16:40.261 --> 16:42.429
Turkey's great.
Perfectly cooked. Perfectly safe.

16:42.463 --> 16:44.498
Wait, what's going on
with the turkey?!

16:44.532 --> 16:46.466
Turkey says hi. Bye.
But... no!

16:46.467 --> 16:47.668
Damn it!

16:47.669 --> 16:49.102
(meows)

16:49.103 --> 16:51.772
Hey, Mr. Business, wait!

16:51.773 --> 16:53.707
Oh, great.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.208
Come down, come on.

16:56.644 --> 16:58.478
Okay. All right.

16:58.479 --> 17:00.480
I'll do the thing.
With the scatting.

17:00.481 --> 17:02.382
All right?
Is that what you want?

17:02.383 --> 17:03.950
Here you go.

17:03.951 --> 17:06.953
(singing scat)

17:08.455 --> 17:11.491
Oh, come on.
You loved the scatting earlier.

17:11.526 --> 17:12.858
You're climbing higher!

17:12.894 --> 17:14.895
Oh, God, this is horrible.

17:14.896 --> 17:16.563
But I'm gonna come get you.

17:16.564 --> 17:18.464
Yup, I've got to get you.

17:18.465 --> 17:19.967
So I'm gonna come up.

17:19.968 --> 17:21.468
(grunting)

17:21.502 --> 17:24.570
Okay, I am very high up,
but no big deal.

17:24.571 --> 17:27.174
I'm just gonna
grab the cat, and...

17:27.175 --> 17:29.376
Good kitty. See?

17:29.377 --> 17:31.211
I won't hurt you.

17:31.212 --> 17:33.513
I'm your uncle, kind of.

17:33.514 --> 17:37.251
Now let's just stay calm
and we'll work our way down.

17:37.252 --> 17:39.152
Very slowly.

17:39.153 --> 17:40.854
GAYLE: Bob? Bob?

17:40.888 --> 17:43.857
I'm up here.
I found Mr... Mr. B...

17:43.858 --> 17:46.326
Mr. B... Uh...
(sneezes)

17:46.327 --> 17:47.694
Uh... Oh, oh...

17:47.695 --> 17:48.695
(screams)

17:48.696 --> 17:51.164
(grunts)

17:51.165 --> 17:54.368
Oh, Bob.
You saved Mr. Business.

17:54.402 --> 17:56.803
I did.
You broke his fall.

17:56.838 --> 17:58.171
(grunts) Bob?

17:58.172 --> 17:59.206
What, Gayle?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.774
Are you still mad at me?

18:00.775 --> 18:02.009
Yes. No.

18:02.010 --> 18:03.243
I mean, it doesn't matter.

18:03.244 --> 18:04.711
Did you get hurt?

18:04.746 --> 18:06.013
I don't know, Gayle.

18:06.014 --> 18:07.414
I landed on my back.

18:07.415 --> 18:10.050
From, mm... maybe ten feet.

18:10.051 --> 18:12.052
So, it's probably fine, right?

18:12.053 --> 18:13.754
Let me try and get up.

18:13.755 --> 18:15.355
Oh, I can't!

18:15.356 --> 18:16.523
I can't sit up.

18:16.524 --> 18:17.658
Oh, Bob.

18:17.692 --> 18:19.693
Uh, I'm dead.

18:19.694 --> 18:21.728
Cut me open and sleep inside me.

18:21.729 --> 18:23.030
You and the cat.

18:23.064 --> 18:24.398
No, Bob.

18:24.399 --> 18:27.401
Let's call that plan B.

18:27.402 --> 18:29.970
(grunting)

18:29.971 --> 18:31.838
(panting)

18:31.873 --> 18:33.106
Wow, Gayle, I can't believe

18:33.107 --> 18:34.875
you pulled me all the way here.

18:34.876 --> 18:36.510
I'm happy to do it, Bob.

18:36.544 --> 18:37.945
I ate all the salad though,

18:37.946 --> 18:40.380
so don't tell anyone
there was salad.

18:40.381 --> 18:44.218
Uh, well,
I guess I should make a toast.

18:44.252 --> 18:46.220
No, Bob.<i> I</i> want to make a toast.

18:46.221 --> 18:47.554
Oh, um, okay.

18:47.555 --> 18:48.922
To you.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.792
Bob, today you proved
that no matter what,

18:51.793 --> 18:53.994
family is always
there for each other.

18:53.995 --> 18:56.463
Even when they drive you crazy.

18:56.464 --> 18:58.966
Gayle, no, y-you don't
drive me crazy.

18:58.967 --> 19:01.335
You can be a real
handful sometimes, Bob.

19:01.336 --> 19:02.736
Oh. (whoops) You drive me nuts.

19:02.737 --> 19:04.238
But I love you.

19:04.239 --> 19:06.807
Well, thanks.
And I want to say to you, Gayle,

19:06.808 --> 19:09.309
that I was mad
that I had to pull you

19:09.310 --> 19:11.845
in a kiddie pool today,
but I'm also glad

19:11.846 --> 19:14.014
that you pulled me
in a kiddie pool.

19:14.015 --> 19:16.616
And maybe it's good
to be annoyed by your family,

19:16.617 --> 19:19.820
because that means you have one.

19:19.821 --> 19:21.455
Aw, Bob.
That's nice.

19:21.456 --> 19:24.091
And Mr. Frond was a fool
to let you go, Gayle,

19:24.092 --> 19:25.926
but we're glad to have you here.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.329
So what happened? I thought
you guys were doing so good.

19:29.364 --> 19:32.165
Oh, he told me
the oldest breakup line

19:32.166 --> 19:33.767
in the breakup book.

19:33.801 --> 19:35.068
"I have scabies"?

19:35.103 --> 19:36.470
No, he said he was going

19:36.471 --> 19:38.639
to visit his aunt
for Thanksgiving.

19:38.673 --> 19:40.173
I mean... (scoffs) Wait, what?

19:40.174 --> 19:41.875
That's all he said?
Gayle, he's probably

19:41.876 --> 19:43.844
actually visiting his aunt
for Thanksgiving.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.780
Yeah, right. Who spends
Thanksgiving with their aunt?

19:46.781 --> 19:50.183
Aunt Gayle, you know
you're our aunt, right?

19:50.184 --> 19:52.819
Oh, my God, you think
he was telling the truth?

19:52.854 --> 19:54.154
Yes!

19:54.188 --> 19:55.489
And you think Jacob Epstein

19:55.490 --> 19:56.957
was telling the truth
when he said

19:56.958 --> 19:58.992
he was going on
a secret mission to South Russia

19:58.993 --> 20:02.162
and he needed to borrow $200
for the taxi there?

20:02.196 --> 20:03.697
Uh-huh. Sure, of course.
Definitely.

20:03.698 --> 20:05.032
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yup.

20:05.066 --> 20:07.401
Well, do I feel silly.
(phone rings)

20:07.402 --> 20:08.835
(gasps) It's him!

20:08.836 --> 20:10.571
It's Mr. Frond!

20:10.572 --> 20:13.307
You know what?
I will call him back.

20:13.341 --> 20:15.809
I'm eating dinner
with my family.

20:15.810 --> 20:17.678
Aw, family.

20:17.679 --> 20:20.480
Now come on, let's ea...
Look at the food.

20:20.481 --> 20:22.082
Look at it. Wow.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.517
Don't look too close.
Look at me.

20:23.518 --> 20:25.719
Oh, God, what happened
to the vegetables?

20:25.753 --> 20:28.288
Survival of the sweetest, Dad.
It's nature's way.

20:28.323 --> 20:30.424
Well, uh, they look... great.

20:30.425 --> 20:31.758
You guys really came through.

20:31.759 --> 20:33.160
I mean, you cooked a turkey.

20:33.161 --> 20:34.995
(whoops)
All right, let's carve it.

20:34.996 --> 20:36.797
Whoa. Comes off real easy.

20:36.831 --> 20:38.198
As it should.
Mm-hmm.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.800
Uh, is this thread?

20:39.834 --> 20:41.802
Yeah, what do you use
to sew your turkeys?

20:41.836 --> 20:43.070
Should we not eat this?

20:43.104 --> 20:44.371
Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it.

20:44.405 --> 20:46.139
We could, maybe...
No.

20:46.174 --> 20:47.674
I'll eat it.

20:47.675 --> 20:50.244
Hey, look who found a plate
of microwave egg rolls.

20:50.278 --> 20:52.112
(Bob humming)

20:52.113 --> 20:53.880
GAYLE: No, no, no.
Something with a little rhythm.

20:53.881 --> 20:55.549
It's got to be jazzy.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.851
BOB: (sighs) Okay, all right,
all right.

20:57.852 --> 21:00.721
(Bob singing scat)

21:00.722 --> 21:03.524
GAYLE: There you go.

21:03.525 --> 21:05.526
Oh, look at him, he loves it.

21:05.527 --> 21:07.060
