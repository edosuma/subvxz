In the criminal justice system

00:04.951 --> 00:08.865
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:08.922 --> 00:10.731
the police
who investigate crime

00:10.791 --> 00:13.601
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.606
These are their stories.

You were gonna send her out like that.

00:38.185 --> 00:39.493
I don't care
if she has no boobs,

00:39.553 --> 00:42.329
I want them
to look at the blouse.

00:42.389 --> 00:45.836
And take her out of those pants.
Her ass is too big for pants.

Elsewhere.

00:56.737 --> 00:57.772
That is not an answer!

00:57.838 --> 00:59.215
Look, she's a no-show.

00:59.272 --> 01:00.751
That little bitch,
she's killing me.

The victim's Brittany Janaway.
She's some kind of model.

01:30.971 --> 01:34.214
I never heard of her, but then, I
don't pay attention to that stuff.

01:34.274 --> 01:35.446

01:35.509 --> 01:37.648
No, let's pay attention
to the here and now.

01:37.711 --> 01:40.248
Oh, sure, yeah. Her father, Dr.
Steven Janaway,

01:40.313 --> 01:43.317
said she was complaining
of severe abdominal pains.

01:43.383 --> 01:46.592
He brought her here, she
collapsed, he attempted CPR.

01:46.653 --> 01:48.496
Who called it in?
The cleaning lady.

01:48.555 --> 01:49.625
And where's the father now?

01:49.689 --> 01:51.669
In his office.
He's a wreck.

01:51.725 --> 01:52.897
Thanks.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.536
Okay. So, it's the middle of the night
and we're all here because of what?

01:57.597 --> 01:58.701

01:58.765 --> 02:00.108
I don't have a cause of death.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.545
What I do have is a big
bruise on her lower back.

02:02.602 --> 02:04.013
I don't know
how long it's been there.

02:04.070 --> 02:06.277
Could it have something to do
with her abdominal pains?

02:06.339 --> 02:09.411
Can't say till we check under the
hood, but I'll tell you what,

02:09.476 --> 02:11.956
my daughter
starts doubling over?

02:12.012 --> 02:13.355
I don't take her to my office.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.687
You'd take her
to an emergency room.

02:14.748 --> 02:15.783
That's right.

02:15.849 --> 02:17.385
What kind of doctor is Janaway?

02:17.451 --> 02:19.055
Plastic surgeon.

02:19.119 --> 02:20.757
These samples of his work?

02:20.821 --> 02:23.062
No, it's his daughter.
She was a model.

02:23.123 --> 02:24.932
How old is she, early twenties?

02:24.991 --> 02:26.163
Try 14.

02:26.226 --> 02:27.296
What?

03:21.168 --> 03:26.015
Well, Brittany didn't come
down for dinner tonight.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.876
She was supposed to work.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.649
A modeling job?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.589
Yeah. Yes.
I thought she overslept.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.156
She usually takes a nap
before one of these events.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.926
They often run past midnight.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.331
So this modeling
wasn't just a hobby.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.370
Oh, no, no, on the contrary.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.203
Brittany started
when she was seven.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.643
So when she didn't come
down, what did you do?

03:54.467 --> 03:55.605
Uh...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.439
I went to her room.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.016
I found her curled up in pain.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.221
She tell you
where the pain was?

04:06.279 --> 04:07.553
Yeah, in her abdomen.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.652
She was crying,

04:12.586 --> 04:14.395
and she was running a fever.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.026
I brought her here
to treat her.

04:22.662 --> 04:23.902
She collapsed.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.501
I tried to bring her back.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.436
I don't understand
why this happened.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.710
BRISCOE: Doctor.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.519
Why didn't you just
take her to a hospital?

04:34.574 --> 04:36.485
It didn't make any sense.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.558
Our house is three minutes
from my office.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.587

to treat her, I thought.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.173
In her previous life, it would've cost
you 800 an hour to see her like this.

Yeah, but she would've
been a lot livelier.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.276

Brittany Janaway?

04:59.332 --> 05:00.777
Just the prelims.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.713
I haven't opened her up yet.
Miss Brown was here first.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.774
Believe me, the world's not holding its
breath to find out what killed Miss Brown.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.944
She's a taxpayer.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.113
Yeah, and I'll bet she
reported every dime of it.

what I have on Janaway.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.019
I was married, wasn't I?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.823
I heard that.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.030
Janaway, Brittany.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.260
No immediate indications
of cardiac arrest,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.394
burst appendix,
or anything of that nature.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.233
What about that
bruise on her back?

05:27.294 --> 05:28.796
A deep contusion, oval shape,

05:28.862 --> 05:31.035
maybe from falling on her
back or from being hit.

05:31.097 --> 05:32.872
Bad enough to cause
internal injuries?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.241
Well, it's hard to tell
without going in.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.336
How old is the wound?

05:35.402 --> 05:37.973
Ballpark to a couple of weeks.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.780
Oh, she also had month-old
scars on her left forearm.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.013
Four of them. Not deep,
from a sharp instrument.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.180
Suicide attempt?

05:44.244 --> 05:48.488
No, wrong part of the arm.
I'd guess some kind of self-mutilation.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.323
You see it a lot
with adolescent girls.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.789
Unhappy adolescent girls.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.627
So much for the fairytale.

05:55.488 --> 05:59.402
I've seen her pictures all over.
I never realized she was 14.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.063
Once you get past
the glitter and the glamour,

06:01.127 --> 06:02.800
you're left with
one sad little girl.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.000
VAN BUREN: The bruise?

06:04.064 --> 06:07.477
And the self-mutilation.
This girl was unhappy.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.808
Any candidates?

06:08.868 --> 06:10.347
The parents.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.383
Daddy should've taken
her to the hospital.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.579
Yeah, the hospital would've reported
the bruises to Children's Services.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.986
If the parents had something
to do with the girl's death,

06:18.044 --> 06:19.182
they wouldn't have
the Mayor's Office

06:19.245 --> 06:22.249
lean on the Chief of
Detectives for some results.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.017
You got calls?

06:24.150 --> 06:27.962
Three so far. The mother's
family's wired to City Hall.

06:28.021 --> 06:32.800
Have a chat with the Janaways,
and please, keep it friendly.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.636
CURTIS: Any idea how
she might have gotten hurt?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.204
The M.E. thinks the bruise
is about two weeks old.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.305
DR. JANAWAY: No.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.783
How about when
she wasn't at home?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.649
Is there anybody
we should talk to?

06:48.708 --> 06:51.086
If she wasn't at home,
she was working.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.216
She spent a lot of time
with her agent, Jeri Stein.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.351
Miss Stein acted
as a chaperone.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.794
You think somebody
hurt my Brittany?

06:58.852 --> 07:04.962
Well, we're concerned about her bruise,
and also, there were cuts on her arm.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.129
Cuts?

07:06.192 --> 07:07.933
You didn't notice either?

07:07.994 --> 07:11.237
I saw she had scratches.
She said they were from our cat.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.073
The medical examiner thinks
they were self-inflicted.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.047
Oh, my God.
I had no idea.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.381
(CRYING) Brittany never
complained about anything.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.721
Did she spend much
time with her agent?

07:27.047 --> 07:31.621
I have to tell you, I never trusted
those people Brittany worked with.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.823
She was so young,
so impressionable.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.993
I never should have allowed it.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.559
(GAYLE SOBBING)

CURTIS: Anybody in your business
ever hear of the kiddy porn laws?

07:49.235 --> 07:51.374
Clients want the Lolita look.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.315
The whole point
is selling clothes,

07:53.373 --> 07:55.284
but we make sure
they keep them on.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.515
What about after the lights go out?
Anyone giving her trouble?

07:58.578 --> 07:59.852
Not when I was around.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.153
And if you weren't?

08:01.214 --> 08:04.161
Mrs. Janaway said she didn't trust
the people her daughter worked with.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.423
Did she include me?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.862
She didn't say.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.059
Brittany had a bad
bruise on her back.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.500
We were hoping maybe you could
tell us how she got it.

08:11.558 --> 08:12.764
She fell in the tub?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.863
Or somebody fell on her?

08:14.928 --> 08:18.740
Well, everybody wanted her,
and I do mean biblically.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.712
Guess being her chaperone, you
had your work cut out for you.

08:22.769 --> 08:26.740
Chaperone? As if.
I have 30 girls to keep working.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.786
Babysitting is why
they have mommies.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.452
Let's try this.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.717
Brittany's wounds were about
two or three weeks old.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.587
Who was she working for then?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.529
Three weeks ago she was doing
fittings with Paul Delacourte

08:38.585 --> 08:40.962
for the show she was
supposed to do last night.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.159
He's requested her a lot
these last couple of months.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.702
What kind of a guy
is Delacourte?

08:45.425 --> 08:48.497
Let's just say, too bad he wasn't in South
Beach last summer to catch a bullet.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.002
I only let my girls work with him
because he gets out the media.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.046
If Delacourte did this,
I'll never forgive him.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.680
They're spoiled,
stupid little brats.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.982
Have you ever looked into
the eyes of a supermodel?

09:04.043 --> 09:06.853
Not since my fling
with Jean Shrimpton.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.450
It's like looking
into the eyes of a goat.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.518
There's nothing
going on in there.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.860
Is that how you treat
them, like farm animals?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.868
I don't pay them $10,000
a day just to wear my clothes.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.631
They have to
put up with me, too.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.603
You treated Brittany
Janaway the same?

09:21.661 --> 09:25.370
She got $8,000 a day, so I
didn't yell at her so much.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.707
Well, you worked with her three weeks ago.
How was that?

09:27.767 --> 09:29.576
I couldn't get
her to stand still.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.980
No matter how much
hitting or yelling?

09:32.038 --> 09:34.279
I never hit her.
I'm not stupid.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.011
Brittany made me
a lot of money.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.489
Whatever she wore, every teenage
girl in America wanted it.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.582
They're like sheep.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.958
BRISCOE: Again with
the farm animals, huh?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.224
Mr. Delacourte, we're gonna need a
list of everybody who was there

09:46.286 --> 09:48.926
when you worked with
Brittany three weeks ago.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.730
I don't carry them with me.
Get them from my office.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.293
And what if we need you?

09:53.693 --> 09:55.263
I'm here for three more days,

09:55.328 --> 09:59.333
then Milan for a week, then Paris
for two days, then Milan again.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.811
My life, it's impossible.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.814
PHOTOGRAPHER: Turn. Great.
Smile. Perfect. Next.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.249
I can talk to you,
but I gotta get ready to go.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.380
The car's coming to pick me up.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.479
No problem.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.082
It's really awful about Brittany.
She anorexic or something?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.593
We don't know why she died.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.390
Listen, we understand
you did a job with her

10:18.451 --> 10:20.124
for Paul Delacourte
a few weeks ago.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.824
Yeah. She didn't
look too sick.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.231
Well, how did
Delacourte treat her?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.563
Who, Paul?

10:24.624 --> 10:28.128
He's a big baby.
He yells, he throws things.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.173
Cassie, can you hear me?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.470
Yeah.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.670
Now, you talked
with her, right?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.804
Yeah, but we didn't
hang out or anything.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.711
Did she say anything
about Delacourte,

10:37.770 --> 10:41.445
like, if he ever came on to
her, or if he ever hit her?

10:41.507 --> 10:42.747
No.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.117
She had a big
bruise on her back.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.021
We were wondering if maybe
you noticed it that day?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.821
No, I didn't,
and I would've seen it.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.986
We did change together before we went home.

It's Rodgers.

CASSIE: I'm expecting
a car to take me to school,

10:57.457 --> 10:59.095
and the driver's
supposed to beep me.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.764
What college you go to? NYU?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.399
College? No way.
I'm in eighth grade.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.342
Brittany wasn't
a real happy person.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.708
She was getting
tired of modeling.

11:08.768 --> 11:09.872
Why's that?

11:09.936 --> 11:11.176
She thought it sucked.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.774
We talked about getting into acting.
It's not hard, you know.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.683
Brooke Shields said, "it's
just modeling in action."

Gotta go. Ciao.

That kid's gonna live a lifetime
before she's old enough to vote.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.465
Five years to go.
Let's hope she makes it.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.902
I found traces of a macular
rash over 30% of her body.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.303
As in an anaphylactic reaction.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.362
Like an allergy?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.635
In a manner of speaking.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.075
The labs turned up staphylococcal
toxins in her blood.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.874
We're supposed to guess
what that is, too?

11:41.934 --> 11:44.005
Toxic shock.
You mean she died from it?

11:44.070 --> 11:48.485
Yeah. It starts with a fever, lots
of aches and pains, then the rash,

11:48.541 --> 11:51.112
then the toxins
build up, cause death.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.383
Well, how much time
we talking about?

11:52.445 --> 11:53.617
Two weeks.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.455
Well, what caused this?

11:55.882 --> 11:58.863
My exam found abraded
areas in the vaginal walls

11:58.918 --> 12:02.422
which were left untreated, and
triggered a Staphylococcal infection.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.899
How bad was the injury?

12:04.557 --> 12:05.968
She was torn up.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.730
Raped.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.603
And how.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.639
She was raped
and she never told anyone?

12:16.703 --> 12:19.149
She must've had her happy
face glued on tight.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.116
The M.E. said she would've
been in a lot of pain.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.552
It's definite?
The rape caused the toxic shock?

12:23.609 --> 12:25.714
Rodgers put a money-back
guarantee on it.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.054
And this Delacourte fellow,
he into little girls?

12:28.114 --> 12:30.617
Well, I'm sure he has a hard time
keeping his hands to himself,

12:30.683 --> 12:33.220
but we talked to some people who were
there when Brittany worked with him.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.788
We don't think
anything happened.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.333
After that he was
out of the country,

12:36.389 --> 12:38.096
and he has the receipts
to prove it.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.831
And after Delacourte, we
suddenly run out of suspects.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.930
Well, it's possible
she didn't report the rape

12:42.995 --> 12:44.997
because the rapist
is somebody she knows.

12:45.064 --> 12:49.274

Lieutenant Van Buren,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.814
what can you tell us about the
Brittany Janaway murder case?

12:56.876 --> 12:58.116
Who said it was murder?

12:58.177 --> 13:00.350
Is it true Brittany Janaway
was sexually assaulted?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.448
First I heard of it.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.925
Isn't it true
there's an autopsy report

13:02.982 --> 13:04.757
saying cause of death
was brutal rape?

13:04.817 --> 13:06.160
If there is, I haven't seen it.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.698
Is Paul Delacourte
still a suspect?

13:07.754 --> 13:11.065
If we haven't determined if there was a
murder, there can't be any suspects.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.195
As soon as we have a statement
to make, we'll notify you.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.967
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to buy a pretzel.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.769
It's pretty much what
you'd expect to hear

13:17.830 --> 13:19.969
from investigators
in this explosive case,

13:20.032 --> 13:22.603
but anonymous sources
have confirmed to News 14,

13:22.668 --> 13:24.545
the cause of death was rape,

13:24.604 --> 13:25.981
and figures inside
the fashion world

wouldn't be wearing blue, would they?

Those leaks did not
come out of my squad.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.235
They got the M.E.'s
report before we did.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.329

stopped, Lieutenant.

Do you want me to compile an
enemies list while I'm at it?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.637
I don't see
anything funny here.

we're going to get leaks.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.412
We might as well
get used to it.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.805
No. That's not good enough.

By the time we present
this case to a jury,

14:02.041 --> 14:04.988
the details will be clues in The
Daily News Sunday crossword.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.421
Which could be the whole point

14:06.479 --> 14:08.425
of leaking the information
in the first place.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.894
The Janaways know people who
know people in the department.

are the anonymous source?

Why not?

that this investigation's
about to turn back on them,

just be preemptive.

Janaway is not a suspect.

that he should be a suspect either.

Why do the police want to speak
to her when he's not present?

of time is reasonable,

20:04.336 --> 20:05.747
We know people down there.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.148
VAN BUREN: Pembleton?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.981
No, the one whose ex-wife
I was sleeping with.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.888
Tell him he'll have
to be more specific.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.546

20:13.612 --> 20:15.387

(VAN BUREN LAUGHING)

20:20.786 --> 20:22.959
You're telling me you
can ID a transsexual?

20:23.022 --> 20:24.126
No problem.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.466
It's not like spotting an elk
with a 12-point rack, you know?

20:26.525 --> 20:27.902
Those parts are real.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.303
The essence isn't.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.342

genetically-romantic Latin sonar crap.

20:40.906 --> 20:41.941
Better answer that.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.652

Come on, Falsone, tell me!

20:47.346 --> 20:49.417
Homicide, Detective Munch.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.360
What do you mean, "Now you
remember my name"? Who is this?

20:52.551 --> 20:54.861
(CHUCKLING) Hey, Gee!

20:54.920 --> 20:56.627
You'll never guess
who's on the line.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.191
So, how's it going, Lennie?

21:00.734 --> 21:03.374
Detective Briscoe didn't give you
any more information than that?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.040
No, just that the girl,
Brittany Janaway,

21:05.105 --> 21:06.982
died in New York two days ago.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.644
And the family still
called Baltimore home?

21:08.708 --> 21:12.212
Yeah, they've got a house in Roland Park.
Dad's a plastic surgeon.

21:12.279 --> 21:16.227
Made his dough bolting after-market parts
on the rich yet physically challenged.

21:16.283 --> 21:19.025
So, he needs background
interviews, grunt work?

21:19.085 --> 21:21.565
Exactly. Can you imagine the
pair that Briscoe's got hanging?

21:21.621 --> 21:23.464
Do it.
Excuse me?

21:23.857 --> 21:27.669
Munch, the fact that Briscoe may
have slept with your ex-first wife

21:27.727 --> 21:31.368
does not take away from the fact that
the man is a fellow police officer,

21:31.431 --> 21:33.377
a member of the brotherhood
of the badge.

21:33.433 --> 21:34.707
Now, if he was
to call down here

21:34.768 --> 21:36.839
for a barrel of funnel
cakes, we'd be obliged.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.840
All right, all right, but how did you
know that Briscoe slept with Gwen?

21:40.807 --> 21:42.218
How do you know
I didn't sleep with her?

21:44.945 --> 21:46.720
Go on, get out of here, Munch.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.656
Hey, Falsone, I need company.

21:52.719 --> 21:53.789
I'm waiting on Meldrick.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.889
I'm buying at the diner.

21:56.890 --> 21:58.369
Meldrick who?

22:01.027 --> 22:02.665
Lieutenant, this
is Mr. Drake,

22:02.729 --> 22:04.299
the lawyer
for Dr. and Mrs. Janaway.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.366
Ah! Mr. Drake.
I've heard about you.

22:06.433 --> 22:08.140
Detective Profaci.
Hello, Detective.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.236
PROFACI: Pleased to meet you.

22:09.302 --> 22:10.975
What brings you
to our corner of paradise?

22:11.037 --> 22:13.847
I'd like you to meet Mr.
John Law from Los Angeles.

22:13.907 --> 22:16.888
He's formerly with the FBI's
Behavioral Science Unit.

22:16.943 --> 22:18.047
He's a profiler.

22:18.111 --> 22:20.113
John Law.
That'd be your real name?

22:20.180 --> 22:21.420
(CHUCKLES)

22:21.915 --> 22:26.193
Uh, Mr. Law has studied the case and
he's prepared a profile of the suspect.

22:26.586 --> 22:29.760
Ah, great. Leave it at the front desk.
Thank you very much,

22:29.823 --> 22:30.893
and have a good day.

22:30.957 --> 22:32.300
DRAKE: Uh,
excuse me, ma'am.

22:32.359 --> 22:33.838
I have a letter
from the Mayor's Office

22:33.894 --> 22:36.932
directing you to attend to
this matter right away.

22:38.465 --> 22:42.743
The victim was a
closely-supervised teenage female.

22:42.802 --> 22:46.841
The offender probably spent a
good amount of time observing her

22:46.907 --> 22:50.081
and planning his assault.
You with me so far?

22:50.143 --> 22:52.123
He stalked her. I got that.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.354
The offender has a job
that affords him mobility

22:57.417 --> 22:59.055
and unsupervised time.

22:59.552 --> 23:02.499
He's single,
lower-middle-class,

23:02.555 --> 23:05.559
lives alone or with
a domineering female.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.627
Now, this is the most
important point.

23:07.694 --> 23:08.798
Good.

23:08.862 --> 23:11.240
The offender
was known to the victim.

23:11.298 --> 23:16.145
The victim's silence was insured by
a credible threat to the victim,

23:16.202 --> 23:18.512
a member of the family
or favorite pet.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.680
Now, investigative strategies.

23:22.309 --> 23:26.519
I suggest deep background checks
on former nannies, housekeepers...

23:26.579 --> 23:28.855
My detectives
are already on that.

23:28.915 --> 23:32.192
I suggest checking their
boyfriends and male relatives.

23:32.252 --> 23:38.168
I also suggest releasing a statement that
you are close to identifying the offender.

23:38.224 --> 23:40.670
This strategy has
proved successful...

23:40.727 --> 23:43.765
Why don't we just let Mr.
Drake leak it to the media?

23:45.165 --> 23:46.303
I resent that.

23:46.366 --> 23:47.743
I'm sure you do.

23:48.535 --> 23:50.276
Who paid for all of this?

23:50.337 --> 23:51.509
My clients paid for this.

23:51.571 --> 23:56.020
Well, does Mr. Law know that your clients
haven't been ruled out as suspects?

23:56.076 --> 23:59.114
I've ruled them out. 100%.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.685
Well, thank you for coming.

24:35.615 --> 24:37.686
What are you skulking
around for, then?

24:38.451 --> 24:40.931
We're looking to talk to a
housekeeper named Helen Caine.

24:40.987 --> 24:42.125
She works for the Janaways.

24:42.188 --> 24:44.964
Not today she doesn't.
It's her day off.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.369
So, this is the residence where Dr.
Janaway and his family reside?

24:47.427 --> 24:48.872
At times, yes.

24:49.763 --> 24:51.140
Pardon me, ma'am.
What's your name?

24:51.197 --> 24:52.540
Sadie Appleyard.

24:52.599 --> 24:55.239
Mrs. Appleyard, when the Janaways
aren't here, where are they?

24:55.301 --> 24:56.803

24:56.870 --> 24:58.781

they were in town last?

24:58.838 --> 25:00.317
Of course I do.
I'm the block captain.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.943
I keep a record of everything.

25:02.008 --> 25:03.146
MUNCH: When was that, ma'am?

25:03.209 --> 25:05.553
You know damn well it was
two and a half weeks ago.

25:06.146 --> 25:07.591
How would we
damn well know that?

25:07.647 --> 25:10.253
Because I called in
a suspicious person report.

25:11.785 --> 25:13.890
Oh, right. What night
was that again?

25:13.953 --> 25:15.864
That was Thursday the 8th.

25:15.922 --> 25:18.528
A couple of uniforms came out here
and took a statement from you?

25:18.591 --> 25:19.661
Yes.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.535
Well, see,
that's why we're here.

25:21.594 --> 25:24.939
Those two boneheads lost the report.
We just need a quick recap.

25:24.998 --> 25:29.242
Well, as I told them,
it was about 8:45

25:29.302 --> 25:32.749
when I was looking outside
my kitchen window

25:32.806 --> 25:35.412
and I saw a cab
parked in front.

25:35.475 --> 25:38.183
As I was turning away,
I saw him.

25:38.244 --> 25:39.382
Saw who, ma'am?

25:39.946 --> 25:45.089
This young man right over
there looking inside.

25:45.418 --> 25:48.763
So I closed my back door
and I called the police.

25:48.822 --> 25:50.324
When I went to look
for him again, he was gone.

25:51.224 --> 25:54.137

man was white or black?

of police time, Mr. Drake.

with our investigation.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.356
What investigation? Huh?

I offered the police the services
of a bona fide FBI man hunter,

26:55.155 --> 26:56.463

26:56.523 --> 27:00.266

ignore his recommendation,

laugh in the man's face!

of this nonsense from you,

you for professional misconduct.

30:13.453 --> 30:16.229
She said she wanted to talk to
the detectives on the case.

30:16.289 --> 30:17.427
She ask about the reward?

30:17.490 --> 30:18.491
No.

30:18.558 --> 30:21.232
She said she's been worrying
ever since the girl died.

30:22.228 --> 30:23.366
Uh-huh.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.570
Put her in Interview.
I'll talk to her.

30:25.631 --> 30:26.871
Okay.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.306
I worked for three
years as a housekeeper.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.816
(SIGHS) Mrs. Janaway,
she liked her socks

30:32.872 --> 30:35.011
arranged by colors
in her dresser.

30:35.074 --> 30:37.247
The same with her underwear,
her sweaters.

30:37.310 --> 30:40.689
She was a precise woman.
She even types out her checks.

30:40.747 --> 30:43.785
Miss Cottone, do you think you know
who attacked Brittany Janaway?

30:45.818 --> 30:47.126
Yes. I think so.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.031
Now, whatever name you give us,

30:49.088 --> 30:50.761
we're gonna have to
check this person out,

30:50.823 --> 30:52.097
do you understand?

30:52.158 --> 30:53.398
Yes.

30:53.459 --> 30:54.995
And if we find out
that you've made up a story

30:55.061 --> 30:58.042
to get someone in trouble,
or for some other reason,

30:58.097 --> 30:59.770
you might face
criminal charges.

30:59.832 --> 31:01.743
Do you understand?
Yes.

31:02.502 --> 31:04.482
All right.
Who's this person?

31:04.537 --> 31:06.676
Ana Ramirez's son, Johnny.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.184
Who's Ana Ramirez?

31:08.241 --> 31:11.882
She worked for the Janaways as a babysitter.
She quit a year ago.

31:12.311 --> 31:15.155
Why do you think
it was her son?

31:15.548 --> 31:17.960
Johnny was always sneaking
around, looking at Brittany.

31:18.017 --> 31:20.930
I didn't like it. I told Ana.
That's why she quit,

31:20.987 --> 31:22.660
before Johnny got
into real trouble.

31:22.722 --> 31:24.360
Did Johnny ever
make trouble for you?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.870
No. He was a nice boy.

31:26.926 --> 31:30.499
But he was always looking
at Brittany that way.

31:30.563 --> 31:32.634
I think there was
something wrong with him.

31:35.201 --> 31:38.114
We're not gonna hurt Johnny, Mrs.
Ramirez. We just want to talk to him.

31:38.171 --> 31:39.946
If he didn't do it,
nothing will happen to him.

31:40.006 --> 31:41.644
And if he did do it,
he needs help,

31:41.707 --> 31:43.277
before he harms
another little girl.

31:43.342 --> 31:46.983
He didn't do this.
He respected Brittany.

31:47.847 --> 31:51.989
BRISCOE: But he paid a lot of attention to her.
Isn't that why you quit?

31:52.051 --> 31:55.863
Look, Mrs. Ramirez, somebody saw
him in Baltimore two weeks ago.

31:55.922 --> 31:57.401
They saw him
at the Janaways' house.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.492
It couldn't be him.

31:58.558 --> 31:59.832
They say he's a big Mets fan.

31:59.892 --> 32:01.098
No. That's not him.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.697
Doesn't he wear
a Mets baseball cap?

32:09.535 --> 32:11.572
It's from his high school.

32:14.841 --> 32:15.876
Oh, God.

32:15.942 --> 32:18.650
Just tell us
where we can find him.

32:18.711 --> 32:24.320
He has a room on East 126th.
Please, don't hurt him.

32:27.553 --> 32:28.964
He's a good boy.

32:30.189 --> 32:32.760
I told him to stop
thinking about her,

32:33.893 --> 32:36.635
but he said that they were
using her to make money.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.675
He said he wanted to save her.

Where have you been?
I called an hour ago.

33:43.768 --> 33:45.076
Ed, traffic.

33:45.136 --> 33:47.673
You drive a police car.
Use the damn siren.

33:48.239 --> 33:49.411
So where's the fire?

33:49.474 --> 33:53.320
In New York. They had the suspect you
gave them, Johnny Ramirez, pinned,

33:53.378 --> 33:54.482
and they lost him.

33:54.546 --> 33:55.854
So you think
he's coming down here?

33:55.914 --> 33:59.361
No, I think you two
are going up there.

33:59.484 --> 34:01.486
I talked to Jack McCoy
in the New York D.A.'s Office.

34:01.553 --> 34:05.091
There's a suspicion that Ramirez had
been stalking Brittany Janaway,

34:05.156 --> 34:06.430
but that's all he'd tell me.

34:06.491 --> 34:08.094
What, they're
withholding information?

34:08.159 --> 34:10.264
I don't think so, but I do think
there's a strong possibility

34:10.328 --> 34:13.969
that a part of the crime or the
crime itself occurred down here.

34:14.032 --> 34:17.411
I had Cox call the Medical
Examiner in New York.

34:17.467 --> 34:20.210
Brittany Janaway died from
some sort of blood infection

34:20.271 --> 34:22.911
as the result
of sexual assault.

34:22.974 --> 34:25.545
So, if Ramirez
is in fact our boy,

34:25.610 --> 34:27.453
he might have raped her
while she was down here,

34:27.512 --> 34:30.356
in which case,
he belongs to us.

34:30.415 --> 34:33.554
If they find him, I want you two
there during the interrogation.

34:33.618 --> 34:34.858
MUNCH: And then what?

34:35.587 --> 34:36.895
Bring him back.

34:43.293 --> 34:46.672
He was either tipped off by his
mother or by Drake's full-page ad.

34:46.731 --> 34:49.974
Yeah, well, it's nice to know that
someone still reads the newspapers.

34:50.034 --> 34:52.536
Any chance of finding
Mr. Ramirez?

34:52.603 --> 34:54.447
The police are talking
to his mother.

34:55.773 --> 34:57.548
They notified Amtrak,
both here and in Baltimore,

34:57.609 --> 35:02.354
and I got a call from an Ed Danvers in
the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office.

35:02.413 --> 35:04.518
Funny, I got
a call from his boss.

35:07.318 --> 35:09.320
Danvers put two detectives
on the Metroliner.

35:10.355 --> 35:15.202
When they get here, just make sure
that our detectives play nice.

for burglary two years ago.

35:39.017 --> 35:40.428
He was given probation.

35:41.352 --> 35:43.662
It is now alleged that he raped

35:43.721 --> 35:46.668
and ultimately killed
Brittany Janaway.

35:46.724 --> 35:50.797
Once again, the police have let
him slip through their fingers.

41:28.299 --> 41:29.573
Johnny?

41:29.633 --> 41:30.839
Get down on your knees.

41:33.004 --> 41:34.381
Don't run!

41:36.741 --> 41:38.049
I told you not to run.

41:38.109 --> 41:40.214
MUNCH: Thanks
for showing up, Johnny.

41:47.018 --> 41:49.225
I didn't hurt her.
I loved her.

41:49.286 --> 41:51.459
She was beautiful.
I couldn't hurt her.

41:53.124 --> 41:54.797
I know you believe in God.

41:55.693 --> 41:57.673
You believe in
the Lord's forgiveness?

41:58.696 --> 42:02.508
That's why you were out in the
cemetery, to ask forgiveness, right?

42:03.401 --> 42:05.244
Well, you can have it, Johnny.

42:06.070 --> 42:08.380
You have to confess your sins.

42:08.439 --> 42:10.578
I loved her.
How could that be a sin?

42:10.641 --> 42:12.177
Don't give me
that religious crap!

42:12.243 --> 42:14.280
What'd you use? Your hands?
A stick? What?

42:14.779 --> 42:16.725
No, I didn't hurt her.

42:16.781 --> 42:19.352
You keep lying to me!
You know what I'm gonna do to you?

42:19.417 --> 42:22.125
I'm gonna break every bone in
your face, so stop lying to me.

42:22.186 --> 42:24.223
Please! I didn't hurt her!

42:26.323 --> 42:28.564
BRISCOE: They saw you
in Baltimore, John.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.230
The cab driver, the neighbors.

42:30.294 --> 42:31.364
They all saw you.

42:31.429 --> 42:32.430
No.

42:32.496 --> 42:34.976
You were there, John.
You had your Mets cap on.

42:35.032 --> 42:36.511
No.

42:36.567 --> 42:39.411
Look, kid, I'm the only
friend you got in this room.

42:39.470 --> 42:42.144
The other guys all want
to stick a needle in you.

42:42.206 --> 42:44.948
Now, you tell me what you did and
you won't have to die for it.

42:45.009 --> 42:46.215
I didn't do anything.

42:46.277 --> 42:50.623
You raped that girl, John.
Come on! Be a man. Admit it.

42:50.681 --> 42:51.819
Tell me you raped that girl.

42:51.882 --> 42:53.919
No! No, I didn't do it!

42:56.253 --> 42:58.164
It's okay you like them young.

42:58.222 --> 43:01.499
I run across a lot of guys in my line
of work that have that preference.

43:01.559 --> 43:03.004
What's that?

43:03.060 --> 43:06.041
This is my hall pass so I can
go to the crapper by myself.

43:06.964 --> 43:09.342
"Defective Monk"?

43:09.400 --> 43:13.542
That's "Detective," with a
"Munch," as in "lunch."

43:13.604 --> 43:17.575
Defective monk,
like a fallen angel.

43:17.641 --> 43:19.382
That's what Brittany was.

43:19.443 --> 43:21.150
Yeah, sure, I can see that.

43:21.212 --> 43:23.818
You told your mother
you wanted to save her.

43:23.881 --> 43:26.020
Is that why you went
down to Baltimore?

43:26.083 --> 43:28.188
Saving her's
a good thing, Johnny.

43:28.252 --> 43:32.291
If that's why you went to Baltimore,
it won't hurt to admit it.

43:32.356 --> 43:33.835
Yeah. I was there.

43:35.092 --> 43:36.503
At her house?

43:36.760 --> 43:38.398
Yeah. I just
wanted to talk to her.

43:38.462 --> 43:40.066
Talk about what?

43:40.131 --> 43:43.442
They were exploiting
her soul and her body.

43:43.501 --> 43:45.242
She let you in?

43:45.302 --> 43:46.645
No, I just watched her.

43:46.704 --> 43:47.978
Through the window?

43:49.039 --> 43:51.485
Yeah. I was just trying
to get a message to her.

43:51.542 --> 43:53.385
How did you get into the house?

43:54.111 --> 43:57.251
I didn't get in.
I just watched her.

43:58.115 --> 43:59.594
I watched what happened to her.

43:59.650 --> 44:01.095
What are you talking about?

44:02.653 --> 44:03.859
Somebody was going at her.

44:03.921 --> 44:04.956
Who?

44:05.589 --> 44:08.365
I couldn't see who it was.
I just saw her.

44:08.425 --> 44:09.904
Who was it, Johnny?

44:09.960 --> 44:11.371
I don't know.

44:11.428 --> 44:15.467
Her dad's car was
in the driveway. A Lexus.

44:21.472 --> 44:23.349
Ramirez claims
he didn't see the assailant,

44:23.407 --> 44:26.445
but he's suggesting
it was the girl's father.

44:27.945 --> 44:30.619
And you want to know
if he's blowing smoke?

44:30.681 --> 44:34.959
For starters, does this crime
fit the pattern for incest?

44:36.687 --> 44:38.496
Sure. Why wouldn't it?

44:39.123 --> 44:41.228
This was a violent rape, Emil.

44:41.926 --> 44:43.269
This wasn't seduction.
It was punishment.

44:44.228 --> 44:45.707
It's all about submission.

44:46.764 --> 44:49.938
Guys who get into this like to
think they're seducing their kids,

44:50.401 --> 44:51.880
but they're not.
They're dominating them.

44:55.139 --> 44:58.018
That still doesn't explain a
father hating his child so much

44:58.075 --> 44:59.679
he'd literally
rape her to death.

45:00.044 --> 45:01.318
(SIGHING)

45:02.313 --> 45:05.089
Give me another 20 years as a shrink,
I'll come up with an explanation.

45:07.218 --> 45:10.563
I'm gonna need some strategies
to deal with Janaway.

45:12.556 --> 45:15.298
Don't hold your breath
for a confession.

45:16.427 --> 45:17.701
(SIGHS)

45:18.162 --> 45:22.440
Jack, you're about to look into a
very ugly corner of the human heart.

45:24.201 --> 45:26.203
Bring a shovel.
