13:32.215 --> 13:34.596
with something sometime this morning.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.429
Okay?

13:36.483 --> 13:37.862
All right.

13:37.862 --> 13:39.154
Okay.

13:39.154 --> 13:39.987
Bye.

13:41.503 --> 13:42.967
Hey, babe?

13:42.967 --> 13:44.568
- Hey. Let me guess.

13:44.568 --> 13:47.438
Some guy's mother-in-law's
wanting me to stop in Mira.

13:47.438 --> 13:49.325
See if I can find out where he is.

13:49.325 --> 13:50.856
Is that about the gist of it?

13:50.856 --> 13:53.103
- Are you eavesdropping?

13:53.103 --> 13:55.180
- This looks good.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.654
- You're not getting
out of that this easy.

13:56.654 --> 13:58.494
Were you listening to my call?

13:58.494 --> 14:00.681
- Nah, it's just your friend...

14:00.681 --> 14:02.418
What's her name?
- Joanne.

14:02.418 --> 14:03.776
- Well, Joanne must be calling

14:03.776 --> 14:06.143
every law enforcement person she knows,

14:06.143 --> 14:09.683
trying to get them to look
for her son-in-law in Mira.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.493
- Well, she just knows
that you're a detective

14:12.493 --> 14:13.717
and we're not far from there.

14:13.717 --> 14:15.965
So she just wanted to see if
maybe you could check it out,

14:15.965 --> 14:18.132
but who else did she call?

14:19.332 --> 14:20.965
- Adcock.

14:20.965 --> 14:21.798
- Jesse?

14:24.791 --> 14:26.658
I don't know. She's just worried.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.036
They haven't heard from him.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.448
- Well, the boss has
already told me to do it.

14:31.448 --> 14:36.088
So I'm headed up there as
soon as I'm finished here.

14:36.088 --> 14:36.952
- What'd he say?

14:36.952 --> 14:40.057
Get your Yankee ass down
there and check it out.

14:40.057 --> 14:42.453
- He drives me crazy with that.

14:42.453 --> 14:45.094
I told him I was born in South Carolina.

14:45.094 --> 14:48.123
Although I grew up for
the most part in Maryland.

14:48.123 --> 14:51.014
Technically I'm from the South.

14:51.014 --> 14:53.316
- Not to folks in these parts.

14:53.316 --> 14:54.930
- Whatever.

14:54.930 --> 14:57.930
(crickets chirping)

15:39.095 --> 15:41.762
(ominous music)

15:59.102 --> 16:00.852
What do we have here?

17:34.937 --> 17:37.280
(soft knocking)

17:37.280 --> 17:40.030
(dramatic music)

18:00.147 --> 18:02.814
(ominous music)

18:15.614 --> 18:18.197
(upbeat music)

18:30.284 --> 18:32.951
(phone ringing)

18:36.233 --> 18:39.816
- He's really starting
to get on my nerves.

19:12.369 --> 19:13.202
Oh no!

19:18.597 --> 19:21.471
You know what, I could use a
break from all this studying,

19:21.471 --> 19:24.291
plus they need me down there

19:24.291 --> 19:26.958
to look after their crazy asses.

19:32.953 --> 19:35.953
(crickets chirping)

19:41.388 --> 19:42.916
(laughing)

19:42.916 --> 19:44.828
- I tell you what, with
all this high water, man,

19:44.828 --> 19:45.693
all I've got to do go

19:45.693 --> 19:48.905
is go out my back door about 50 feet.

19:48.905 --> 19:52.938
You know, cast a line and five
minutes later, I got dinner.

19:52.938 --> 19:55.386
(laughing)

19:55.386 --> 19:57.394
Hey listen, let me hook up with you

19:57.394 --> 19:59.561
in the morning, all right?

20:00.636 --> 20:03.240
All right, I gotta get
some work done around here.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.960
All right. I'll see you.

20:04.960 --> 20:05.877
All right.

20:08.546 --> 20:10.210
Sorry to keep you waiting, my friend.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.610
Thank you for being patient.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.072
- No problem.

20:13.072 --> 20:14.094
- All right.

20:14.094 --> 20:18.514
Now then, any sign of our guy
on the way in this morning?

20:18.514 --> 20:22.166
- I did find his car, but no sign of him.

20:22.166 --> 20:25.934
I checked the nearest houses
and they seem to be vacant,

20:25.934 --> 20:28.880
and there were two flat
tires just like you said.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.840
- You know, with every minute that goes by

20:31.840 --> 20:34.116
and that family don't hear from that boy,

20:34.116 --> 20:35.748
that feeling in the pit of their stomach

20:35.748 --> 20:38.722
just gets worse and worse.

20:38.722 --> 20:40.544
- You think there's something to this?

20:40.544 --> 20:43.364
I mean, it hasn't been 24 hours yet.

20:43.364 --> 20:45.680
- Well, now, hold on just a second.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.354
Stop thinking like a
detective for a minute.

20:48.354 --> 20:49.201
All right?

20:49.201 --> 20:51.368
Now, what if it was Karen?

20:52.670 --> 20:55.025
And what if some police
officer was telling you

20:55.025 --> 20:57.899
that it hadn't even been 24 hours yet?

20:57.899 --> 21:01.054
Now, is that gonna make
you feel any better?

21:01.054 --> 21:02.444
Is it?

21:02.444 --> 21:03.444
Well, is it?

21:05.709 --> 21:07.209
I didn't think so.

21:09.041 --> 21:11.557
- Well, what do we know about this kid?

21:11.557 --> 21:13.597
- Well, now, I got to thinking about that.

21:13.597 --> 21:14.957
I remember meeting him a couple of times

21:14.957 --> 21:17.494
when he came to church with Melissa.

21:17.494 --> 21:19.620
Seemed like a really nice young man.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.619
Beautiful family.

21:21.619 --> 21:23.984
- I'll definitely keep
my eyes and ears open.

21:23.984 --> 21:25.974
- Well, it's all I'm asking.

21:25.974 --> 21:28.539
I mean, I know that we don't
have a whole lot of crime

21:28.539 --> 21:32.956
in these parts, but we're
certainly not immune to it.

21:34.246 --> 21:36.812
- Well, it seems there's some
calls that I need to make.

21:36.812 --> 21:38.212
If you would excuse me, sir.

21:38.212 --> 21:39.295
- Absolutely.

21:40.554 --> 21:41.887
Keep me updated.

21:42.930 --> 21:43.843
- Yes, sir. I will.

21:43.843 --> 21:44.843
- All right.

21:49.803 --> 21:52.470
(phone ringing)

22:01.005 --> 22:02.841
- [Karen] Hey babe, what's up?

22:02.841 --> 22:05.311
- Hey, I'm just following up with you.

22:05.311 --> 22:08.221
Although I think Adcock
has probably already given

22:08.221 --> 22:09.767
Ms. Joanne a call.

22:09.767 --> 22:10.938
- [Karen] That's fine.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.975
So what'd you find out?

22:12.975 --> 22:14.107
- Nothing new, really?

22:14.107 --> 22:15.690
I did find his car.

22:17.199 --> 22:19.782
(upbeat music)

22:39.211 --> 22:40.044
- Fuck!

22:42.550 --> 22:44.182
Fuck this.

22:44.182 --> 22:46.955
(phone ringing)

22:46.955 --> 22:47.977
- [Melissa] Hello?

22:47.977 --> 22:49.982
- Is this Melissa Yancey?

22:49.982 --> 22:51.732
- [Melissa] Yes, who's calling?

22:51.732 --> 22:54.165
- This is Detective Keith Copeland.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.525
- [Melissa] Oh, no.
Don't tell me he's gone.

22:55.525 --> 22:56.858
I can't take it.

22:58.404 --> 22:59.931
- No, ma'am. No, ma'am.

22:59.931 --> 23:03.186
I just called to let you
know I did find his car,

23:03.186 --> 23:05.705
and just to ask you a few questions.

23:05.705 --> 23:08.393
Please calm down. I
didn't mean to upset you.

23:08.393 --> 23:09.834
- [Melissa] Detective,
sir, I'm telling you,

23:09.834 --> 23:10.987
something is wrong with Dan.

23:10.987 --> 23:12.133
He wouldn't do this.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.846
- Just calm down, Melissa.

23:13.846 --> 23:17.097
You're probably getting yourself
all worked up over nothing.

23:17.097 --> 23:18.897
- [Melissa] Something's
wrong. I can feel it.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.647
(birds chirping)

23:26.277 --> 23:28.141
- Yeah, the storm the other night?

23:28.141 --> 23:29.727
Yeah, it wasn't messing around.

23:29.727 --> 23:33.013
I'm still out here cleaning up this mess.

23:33.013 --> 23:34.305
Yeah.

23:34.305 --> 23:35.752
All right then, boss.

23:35.752 --> 23:37.585
I'll talk to you later

23:38.461 --> 23:39.544
(dog barking)

23:39.544 --> 23:40.397
- No.

23:40.397 --> 23:42.172
The only reason that I'm going

23:42.172 --> 23:43.769
is to make sure that you and Caleb

23:43.769 --> 23:45.948
don't end up underneath the parish jail

You sure is fine.

26:40.075 --> 26:42.479

you from around here?

We can hook up later.

getting out of a relationship

26:59.399 --> 27:03.121
and I'm trying to focus on my education.

27:03.121 --> 27:03.954
So, sorry.

27:05.433 --> 27:07.782
- [Ray] Okay. Yeah.

27:07.782 --> 27:09.076
- Yeah.

27:09.076 --> 27:11.988
But it was nice meeting you, Roy.

27:11.988 --> 27:13.855
- That's Ray.

27:13.855 --> 27:14.740
- Sorry, Ray.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.432
I'm gonna put my window back up now.

27:17.432 --> 27:18.265
Take care.

27:21.037 --> 27:22.287
- Little trick.

27:25.647 --> 27:27.675
Ain't no pretty little thing like that

27:27.675 --> 27:30.633

like you comin' home,

27:30.633 --> 27:34.051
putting his filthy paws
on her every night.

27:34.051 --> 27:36.055
- Listen, you got one
more time to call me-

27:36.055 --> 27:38.070
- Calm down, Ray.

27:38.070 --> 27:39.349
Look it there.

27:39.349 --> 27:41.774
A real life interracial couple.

27:41.774 --> 27:44.004
Can't we all just get along?

27:44.004 --> 27:45.230
- Hillbilly asshole.

27:47.094 --> 27:51.094

28:08.616 --> 28:10.043
You need a jump, dude.

28:10.043 --> 28:10.876
Cables?

28:10.876 --> 28:11.709
- No, you got any?

28:11.709 --> 28:12.822
- No, my boy got mine.

28:12.822 --> 28:14.626
- That's doin' me a lot of good right now.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.883
- Why can't your parents
just buy you a new car?

28:16.883 --> 28:18.294
It's not like they can't afford it.

28:18.294 --> 28:19.218
- I don't know, Jennifer.

28:19.218 --> 28:21.732
Why can't your parents buy you a new car?

28:21.732 --> 28:22.582
- Jesus Christ, you guys.

28:22.582 --> 28:23.942
It's just the battery.

28:23.942 --> 28:26.254
- Don't use the Lord's name in vain.

28:26.254 --> 28:28.874
- I think your girl's a
little cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.316
- I know you're not talking about me.

28:30.316 --> 28:32.382
- You folks need some help?

28:32.382 --> 28:33.846
- [James] Yeah, man.

28:33.846 --> 28:36.236
Y'all won't happen to have
any cables, would you?

28:36.236 --> 28:37.138
- Hey, Ray.

28:37.138 --> 28:38.634
Bring over those jumper cables

28:38.634 --> 28:41.717
and let's help these nice people out.

28:42.867 --> 28:44.288
- [Caleb] Thanks, man.

28:44.288 --> 28:46.288
We really appreciate it.

29:02.599 --> 29:05.682
(car engine revving)

29:09.263 --> 29:11.319
- You folks headed to Shreveport?

29:11.319 --> 29:12.372
- No.

29:12.372 --> 29:13.887
No, we're headed up to the Johnson place

29:13.887 --> 29:16.320
right up the road, you know?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.124
- Oh, I know it.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.813
What y'all goin' there for?

29:20.813 --> 29:22.878
- Can we just go please?

29:22.878 --> 29:24.692
It's nobody's business where we're going

29:24.692 --> 29:26.076
or what we're doing when we get there.

29:26.076 --> 29:27.646
- Sorry about that, man.

29:27.646 --> 29:29.763
Listen, thanks again.
We really appreciate it.

29:29.763 --> 29:30.596

32:04.449 --> 32:05.449

32:07.992 --> 32:10.575
Great. Electricity is still on.

32:12.261 --> 32:14.344
- [John] Oh wow! Not bad.

32:21.426 --> 32:24.368
- Man, y'all don't even get
the regular channels up here?

32:24.368 --> 32:26.416
- We came to throw a party, not watch TV.

32:26.416 --> 32:27.772
- Speak for yourself.

32:27.772 --> 32:29.752
A movie sounds real good to me.

32:29.752 --> 32:31.824
- Yeah. I'm not in much of
a partying moody either.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.907
- Y'all some squares.

32:35.279 --> 32:37.709
- Wow.
- Spooky looking dude.

32:37.709 --> 32:39.169
- Who's this, Caleb?

32:39.169 --> 32:41.363
- That's my great, great
grandpa on my dad's side.

32:41.363 --> 32:43.929
- (chuckles) There's one
serious looking dude.

32:43.929 --> 32:46.248
- Yeah, well, most slave owners were.

32:46.248 --> 32:47.975
- Slave owners?

32:47.975 --> 32:49.521
How you know he was a slave owner?

32:49.521 --> 32:51.053
- James and I grew up together.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.199
K-12. He knows everything about my family.

32:53.199 --> 32:54.407
- Exactly, that's how he knows

32:54.407 --> 32:56.991
my great, great grandparents
were sharecroppers

32:56.991 --> 32:58.723
for his great, great grandparents.

32:58.723 --> 33:00.109
- That's interesting.

33:00.109 --> 33:02.806
- Why am I not surprised?

33:02.806 --> 33:05.805
- Anyway, hey, did your
great, great grandfather

33:05.805 --> 33:07.369
mistreat his slaves?

33:07.369 --> 33:10.125
- Enslavement within
itself is mistreatment.

33:10.125 --> 33:11.952
What kinda asinine question is that?

33:11.952 --> 33:12.972
- Look, chill out.

33:12.972 --> 33:14.400
Look, that's a legitimate question.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.181
If you look at the timeframe it's in,

33:16.181 --> 33:18.860
everybody thinks that all
slave owners mistreated slaves,

33:18.860 --> 33:20.609
but that's not always the case.

33:20.609 --> 33:22.145
- Can we change the subject please?

33:22.145 --> 33:22.993
- Wait, wait.

33:22.993 --> 33:24.525
Let's let the man answer the question.

33:24.525 --> 33:25.799
- It's funny you asked the question,

33:25.799 --> 33:27.481
because from everything
I've always been told,

33:27.481 --> 33:28.828
he did treat his slave slaves good

33:28.828 --> 33:30.229
but he was just a racist.

33:30.229 --> 33:32.486
I mean, he believed black
people could buy their freedom

33:32.486 --> 33:36.145
or whatever, but he didn't
think we should mix the races.

33:36.145 --> 33:38.235
- Well, I guess that racist son of a bitch

33:38.235 --> 33:41.543
is rolling around in
his grave as we speak.

33:41.543 --> 33:43.234
- Well, you joke about that now,

33:43.234 --> 33:46.639
but supposedly, my great uncle,

33:46.639 --> 33:48.980
which was my great,
great grandfather's son,

33:48.980 --> 33:50.357
well, he fell in love with a black woman

33:50.357 --> 33:52.265
and he didn't like that one bit.

33:52.265 --> 33:54.434
- What did he do?

33:54.434 --> 33:57.420
- Well, of course he
said he would disown him

33:57.420 --> 33:58.558
if he didn't end it,

33:58.558 --> 34:03.021
but uncle called his bluff and
he got engaged to her anyway.

34:03.021 --> 34:04.381
- Well, good for him.

34:04.381 --> 34:07.259
- [Caleb] But a couple of
days before the wedding,

34:07.259 --> 34:08.703
my uncle goes missing.

34:08.703 --> 34:10.065
- What? What happened?

34:10.065 --> 34:11.683
- Well, they found him
a couple of days later,

34:11.683 --> 34:13.196
face down in a creek that used to run

34:13.196 --> 34:15.034
by their property here back then.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.900
He'd been struck in the back of the head.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.447
- Was he dead?
- Yeah.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.328
And he started to
decompose a little bit too.

34:21.328 --> 34:23.989
- Wow. Creepy story, dude.

34:23.989 --> 34:25.295
- Yeah, it's starting to get dark.

34:25.295 --> 34:27.138
We need to like change this subject.

34:27.138 --> 34:30.518
- Yeah. Let's set up the
tables, get everything ready?

34:30.518 --> 34:31.453
- No shit.

34:31.453 --> 34:32.447
Well, people should start showing up here

34:32.447 --> 34:34.031
pretty soon anyway.

34:37.665 --> 34:40.081
- Y'all just gonna sit there?

34:42.472 --> 34:44.003
- I guess I'll help.

34:44.003 --> 34:47.053
I need to do something to
keep my focus off this phone.

34:47.053 --> 34:48.498
- You got boy problems?

34:48.498 --> 34:50.371
- More Like stalker problems.

34:50.371 --> 34:53.900
- Actually, I wanna go check
it out across the street,

34:53.900 --> 34:55.815
before it gets dark.

34:55.815 --> 34:56.663
- Why?

34:56.663 --> 34:57.973
Those woods over there
don't look any different

34:57.973 --> 34:59.676
from the woods right over here.

34:59.676 --> 35:00.887
- You know what? I'll go with you.

35:00.887 --> 35:01.720
Come on.
- Yeah.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.796
Shelly knows her way around up.

35:03.796 --> 35:05.037
- You coming, Cherika?

35:05.037 --> 35:08.184
- I guess I'll follow y'all up.

35:08.184 --> 35:10.256
- You gonna come out with us,

35:10.256 --> 35:11.897
or you're gonna go with them?

35:11.897 --> 35:14.528
- I'm not exactly crazy
about either option,

35:14.528 --> 35:16.085
but I guess I'll go with them.

35:16.085 --> 35:19.085
- [Caleb] All right, that's my girl.

35:20.865 --> 35:22.003
- Help your friends.

35:22.003 --> 35:23.184
We'll be back in a second.

35:23.184 --> 35:25.925
- Come on, don't be like that.

35:25.925 --> 35:27.008
Man, shut up.

35:31.811 --> 35:34.443
- So, how long have you known Caleb?

35:34.443 --> 35:35.909
- About eight years now.

35:35.909 --> 35:38.588
Yeah, we met in junior
high, like sixth grade.

35:38.588 --> 35:41.684
- Has he always liked black girls?

35:41.684 --> 35:43.084
- Let's see.

35:43.084 --> 35:46.144
You know what, back then
he had a white girlfriend.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.262
But he was a little bit of a player.

35:49.262 --> 35:51.074
- That was just like
his little crazy behind.

35:51.074 --> 35:54.134
(girls giggling)

35:54.134 --> 35:55.569
- Whose house is this?

35:55.569 --> 35:58.236
- This is Caleb's uncle's house.

36:08.031 --> 36:10.541
- What happened to you, Daniel?

36:10.541 --> 36:12.937
- Hold on for a second,
y'all. This is my mom.

36:12.937 --> 36:15.734
She thinks I'm still at school.

36:15.734 --> 36:17.302
- Well, I might as well
go ahead and call home too

36:17.302 --> 36:19.209

commotion gets started up

36:19.209 --> 36:20.911

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.266
Jennifer's psychopath brother, all right?

01:10:45.266 --> 01:10:46.930
- I'm staying right here. I'm not moving.

01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:47.810
- Okay, great.

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.373
You have to deal with them now.

01:10:49.373 --> 01:10:51.040
- You go I got it.

01:10:53.756 --> 01:10:55.080
- Party's over, okay?

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.215
We're closed for business.

01:10:56.215 --> 01:10:57.957
- As far as I'm concerned,
this party's been over.

01:10:57.957 --> 01:11:00.124
We just need to go inside.

01:11:01.943 --> 01:11:04.772
- I'm sorry, I can't let y'all in.

01:11:04.772 --> 01:11:06.517
- What do you mean you can't let us in?

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:08.418
Look, it's been a long night. I'm tired.

01:11:08.418 --> 01:11:10.165
I really don't feel like
dealing with your shit.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:12.642
Justin just needs to go lay down.

01:11:12.642 --> 01:11:15.139
- Hey, where's your little friend?

01:11:15.139 --> 01:11:16.928
- He just walked off.

01:11:16.928 --> 01:11:18.067
Hey, chill out.

01:11:18.067 --> 01:11:20.381
I can't let nobody in.

01:11:20.381 --> 01:11:23.228
- You are out of your freaking mind.

01:11:23.228 --> 01:11:26.265
You and Caleb need fucking help.

01:11:26.265 --> 01:11:27.708
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:28.573
I can't deal with this.

01:11:28.573 --> 01:11:29.490
I'll drive.

01:11:31.246 --> 01:11:32.348
- Be safe.

01:11:32.348 --> 01:11:34.029
- [Shelly] Don't talk to me.

01:11:34.029 --> 01:11:37.911
- [Justin] Told you they
were some little punks.

01:11:37.911 --> 01:11:40.265
- Hey, what's going on here?

01:11:40.265 --> 01:11:41.098
Hey.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:43.482
Hey, I asked you a question.

01:11:43.482 --> 01:11:45.001
What the hell going on in there?

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:46.537
What you hidin'?

01:11:46.537 --> 01:11:48.491
(ominous music)

01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:50.283
That's it. I'm done playin' around, man.

01:11:50.283 --> 01:11:51.116
I'm calling the cops.

01:11:51.116 --> 01:11:53.659
- Look, you don't wanna go in.

01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:54.764
It's a mess, all right?

01:11:54.764 --> 01:11:58.681
Somebody got sick and
they threw up everywhere.

01:12:01.898 --> 01:12:04.842
- I don't believe a word coming
out of your fucking mouth.

01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:05.925
You got that?

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:09.270
- Look, you sister's not in here.

01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:12.547
It's all you care about, right?

01:12:12.547 --> 01:12:14.386
- Is that right?

01:12:14.386 --> 01:12:18.291
If Jennifer is not here in five minutes,

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:20.898
there's nothing, I repeat, nothing,

01:12:20.898 --> 01:12:23.377
that's gonna stop me
from getting in there.

01:12:23.377 --> 01:12:26.127
I'm a be all up in your ass, boy.

01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:34.190
♪ I've been just wanting
to see your shit ♪

01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:36.632
- Hey, cut it. Cut it, dude.

01:12:36.632 --> 01:12:39.180
Guys, look, we appreciate
you guys coming out tonight

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.562
to party with us and we hope
you had fun, but party's over.

01:12:41.562 --> 01:12:42.621
You guys gotta go home.

01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:43.499
Drive safe.

01:12:43.499 --> 01:12:45.865
Just drive safely and go home. Go home.

01:12:45.865 --> 01:12:47.283
- What's going on?
- Just go home.

01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:48.880
(ominous music)
It's over, okay?

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.713
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.701
Nice. Just nice.

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.105
Fuck, man!

01:12:59.034 --> 01:13:02.034
(crickets chirping)

01:13:06.586 --> 01:13:08.372
- I'm certain we need to
get the hell outta here.

01:13:08.372 --> 01:13:10.122
Let me get your keys.

01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:14.964
Just be still. I'll grab 'em.

01:13:14.964 --> 01:13:18.576
Probably, you got like some broken ribs.

01:13:18.576 --> 01:13:21.409
Just take you to a hospital, okay?

01:13:29.153 --> 01:13:31.189
- Jen, I'm really not in
the mood for this tonight.

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:33.522
I'm about to leave your ass.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.246
Time's up, kid.

01:13:39.394 --> 01:13:41.860
- Look, man. You can't go in there.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.396
- And who's gonna stop me?

01:13:43.396 --> 01:13:44.313
You, nigga?

01:13:45.218 --> 01:13:46.968
- You're trespassin'.

01:13:47.825 --> 01:13:49.997
- Don't ever put your hands on me again.

01:13:49.997 --> 01:13:51.106
- Dude, what the fuck, dude?

01:13:51.106 --> 01:13:51.939
You can't go-
- Jen.

01:13:51.939 --> 01:13:53.853
- Hey.
- Jennifer.

01:13:53.853 --> 01:13:54.749
Jen, you in here?

01:13:54.749 --> 01:13:56.603
- Hey, I told you she
ain't in here, nigga.

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:58.491
- Back off me.

01:13:58.491 --> 01:14:00.538
- We told you, you
can't come in here, sir.

01:14:00.538 --> 01:14:01.679
Dude, you gotta get out of here.

01:14:01.679 --> 01:14:03.020
- Get your fucking hands off me.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.119
- Dude, this is my fucking property.

01:14:04.119 --> 01:14:05.178
- I don't give a fuck.

01:14:05.178 --> 01:14:06.184
Jen!

01:14:06.184 --> 01:14:08.262
Jen. What the...

01:14:08.262 --> 01:14:09.286
What the fuck?

01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:10.326
What the fuck?

01:14:10.326 --> 01:14:11.702
- What the fuck?
- Jen.

01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:12.726
Jen!

01:14:12.726 --> 01:14:14.997
- Dude, what the fuck is that?

01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:16.837
What the fuck is that?

01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:19.004
- Jen!
- Fucking dead body.

01:14:22.441 --> 01:14:23.736
- Shit!

01:14:23.736 --> 01:14:25.704
- Okay, some party, huh?

01:14:25.704 --> 01:14:27.523
- Yeah, I guess.

01:14:27.523 --> 01:14:29.223
It ended kind of abruptly though.

01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:32.640
However, it all doesn't have to end here.

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:37.092
- Such a gentleman.

01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:39.092
- As always, sweetheart.

01:14:42.088 --> 01:14:44.722
- Three more fucking dead bodies?

01:14:44.722 --> 01:14:46.222
Are you fucking...

01:14:50.617 --> 01:14:53.284
(ominous music)

01:14:57.909 --> 01:15:00.242
(screaming)

01:15:06.425 --> 01:15:07.258
- What the fuck was that?

01:15:07.258 --> 01:15:09.301
- Our imaginary killer
killing somebody else.

01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:11.718
- What are you talking about?

01:15:13.191 --> 01:15:14.041
- Jason.

01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:14.874
Hey.

01:15:14.874 --> 01:15:15.707
Hey.

01:15:15.707 --> 01:15:17.095
It's okay, it's okay.

01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:18.388
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:19.221
Oh my god.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.755
- It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna...

01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:26.172
- Son of a bitch.

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:29.952
- We gotta go.

01:15:32.909 --> 01:15:33.791
- We need some weapons.

01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.196
Y'all ain't got no straps in here?

01:15:35.196 --> 01:15:37.196
- What the fuck is that?

01:15:40.251 --> 01:15:41.903
What the fuck!

01:15:41.903 --> 01:15:43.134
- I need something
different than this knife.

01:15:43.134 --> 01:15:44.191
We gotta get you close to him.

01:15:44.191 --> 01:15:46.608
- Dude, I don't fucking know.

01:15:48.798 --> 01:15:49.631
Fuck!

01:15:50.722 --> 01:15:52.179
- Look, I need you to
snap the fuck out of it.

01:15:52.179 --> 01:15:55.135
All right, we gotta get out
there and show some bottle.

01:15:55.135 --> 01:15:56.561
Look at me.

01:15:56.561 --> 01:15:57.838
Get your shit together.

01:15:57.838 --> 01:15:59.541
I need you, bro.

01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:01.532
- Fine. Fine.
- Come on.

01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:02.365
- Fine.

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.880
- We're gonna have to either
go to the police station

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.327
or call from the highway.

01:16:07.327 --> 01:16:09.264
- I'm not leaving him.

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.734
- Sweetheart, he's dead.

01:16:10.734 --> 01:16:11.567
He's gone.

01:16:12.912 --> 01:16:15.794
(grunting)

01:16:15.794 --> 01:16:18.461
(ominous music)

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.897
- Where he at?
- There, there.

01:16:30.578 --> 01:16:31.437
- Where have you guys been?

01:16:31.437 --> 01:16:34.189
We could have used your help.

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.693
- Fuck that.

01:16:35.693 --> 01:16:36.847
It's every man for himself.

01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:37.680
I'm about to bounce.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.513
- Caleb, do something.

01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:40.605
- No, no, no. I suggest you
guys get the hell out of here.

01:16:40.605 --> 01:16:43.772
I'm getting the fuck out of here, man.

01:16:45.648 --> 01:16:46.874
(screaming)

01:16:46.874 --> 01:16:49.707
(gunshot blaring)

01:17:05.718 --> 01:17:06.801
- Is he dead?

01:17:07.946 --> 01:17:10.665
- I guess his crazy ass was
good for something after all.

01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:12.252
- Oh yeah.

01:17:12.252 --> 01:17:14.669
That shit came in the nick of time.

01:17:23.623 --> 01:17:26.533
- Are the cops on the way?

01:17:26.533 --> 01:17:28.150
- I'm gonna go to the police station.

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:30.470
I can't get any service
out here for some reason.

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.253
- That son of a bitch
probably killed my sister.

01:17:33.253 --> 01:17:34.341
- What you doing, man?

01:17:34.341 --> 01:17:36.278
Still bouncing?

01:17:36.278 --> 01:17:38.297
- No, that cocksucker's dead.

01:17:38.297 --> 01:17:41.143
I got a lot of explaining
to the cops, man.

01:17:41.143 --> 01:17:42.538
Shit, dude. You can go
ahead and bounce, man.

01:17:42.538 --> 01:17:44.218
You don't have to hang
around for that headache.

01:17:44.218 --> 01:17:46.261
- Walk around these words by myself?

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:47.558
Fuck that.

01:17:47.558 --> 01:17:49.225
- All right. Thanks.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:51.635
- Hey, Chris.

01:17:51.635 --> 01:17:52.561
You wanna follow us up?

01:17:52.561 --> 01:17:54.052
It's about 20 minutes out?

01:17:54.052 --> 01:17:54.885
(ominous music)

01:17:54.885 --> 01:17:58.802
- [Chris] No, I think
I'm just gonna stay here.

01:18:04.387 --> 01:18:06.970
- Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

01:18:08.533 --> 01:18:10.692
- I'm not leaving him.

01:18:10.692 --> 01:18:14.025
Can you guys just go and leave us alone?

01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:18.017
- I'll be right back.

01:18:18.017 --> 01:18:20.449
- Hey, I'm a go holler at Jen's brother.

01:18:20.449 --> 01:18:22.116
- I'm with you, bro.

01:18:27.478 --> 01:18:28.737
- I'm gonna head to the police station.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:31.487
- All right. Be safe.
- All right.

01:18:32.509 --> 01:18:34.403
- Some party you threw here.

01:18:34.403 --> 01:18:35.603
- Look, man, I'm sorry.

01:18:35.603 --> 01:18:37.658
- Look, just save it.

01:18:37.658 --> 01:18:39.592
Because wherever my sister is,

01:18:39.592 --> 01:18:41.482
your weak ass apology ain't gon' help.

01:18:41.482 --> 01:18:42.565
You got that?

01:18:58.073 --> 01:19:00.323
(coughing)

01:19:09.818 --> 01:19:11.034
- Help!

01:19:11.034 --> 01:19:13.201
(panting)

01:19:26.171 --> 01:19:27.004
Help!

01:19:38.345 --> 01:19:39.178
Help!

01:19:48.442 --> 01:19:49.275
Help!

01:19:49.275 --> 01:19:51.442
(sobbing)

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.683
- [James] Hey, I think I
see somebody over there.

01:20:00.155 --> 01:20:01.143
- Help!

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:03.310
(sobbing)

01:20:07.851 --> 01:20:09.418
- Oh my God, Jennifer?

01:20:09.418 --> 01:20:10.418
It's Shelly.

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:12.823
Oh my God, are you okay?

01:20:12.823 --> 01:20:14.151
It's Shelly.

01:20:14.151 --> 01:20:15.382
It's okay. I'm gonna help you.

01:20:15.382 --> 01:20:17.632
- John and Trisha are dead?

01:20:19.366 --> 01:20:21.346
I don't even remember what happened.

01:20:21.346 --> 01:20:23.140
(sobbing)
- It's okay.

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:23.973
It's okay.

01:20:25.922 --> 01:20:26.836
Jennifer, Chris is here.

01:20:26.836 --> 01:20:28.500
- Chris, where is he?

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.955
- Chris.
