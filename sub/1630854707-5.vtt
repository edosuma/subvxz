WEBVTT

00:16.174 --> 00:17.542
You fuckin' survived.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.310
I lived.
I wouldn't say I survived.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.547
- I'm supposed to talk to Joseph.
- It's your funeral.

00:22.547 --> 00:24.715
You just found this?

00:24.715 --> 00:26.617
Tell this woman that we're
gonna take care of the bonds,

00:26.617 --> 00:28.219
and that she should go wait
for her husband.

00:28.219 --> 00:29.420
<i>If he doesn't come back,</i>

00:29.420 --> 00:31.789
<i>she should find
a new fuckin' zip code.</i>

00:32.990 --> 00:34.926
'Cause Milo's gonna come
looking for what's his.

00:36.394 --> 00:37.495
They movin' people, Mike.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.931
Your boy screwed us.

00:39.931 --> 00:42.500
You got some
angry-ass motherfuckers

00:42.500 --> 00:44.102
looking right at you.

00:44.102 --> 00:45.703
And DOJ fucking pressure.

00:45.703 --> 00:47.572
They're looking to burn
this whole fucking house down,

00:47.572 --> 00:48.940
including me.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.374
<i>So forgive me
if I don't give a shit</i>

00:50.374 --> 00:52.410
if a couple of street criminals
are inconvenienced.

00:52.410 --> 00:53.711
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?

00:53.711 --> 00:55.179
You're not the mayor to me, Mike.

00:55.179 --> 00:56.481
I don't work for you.

00:56.481 --> 00:58.916
You lose Bunny,
you lose the fucking prison,

00:58.916 --> 01:00.518
and we lose fucking Kingstown.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.819
<i>You're on
the clock now, Mike.</i>

01:01.819 --> 01:04.088
<i>Every second, every minute.</i>

01:05.957 --> 01:06.688
<i>There's gonna be some payback.</i>

01:22.635 --> 01:24.803
They just took him out of
that tent place

01:24.803 --> 01:26.739
in the middle of
the goddamn night,

01:26.739 --> 01:28.440
and now I have no idea
where he's at.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.142
This is bullshit!
Excuse my language.

01:30.142 --> 01:32.378
His own damn lawyer
can't find him!

01:32.378 --> 01:33.445
Please!

01:33.445 --> 01:35.114
Everyone, just take a seat.

01:35.114 --> 01:37.282
I promise you that
everyone will get seen.

01:37.282 --> 01:38.484
All right?

01:38.484 --> 01:39.718
Someone let Mrs. Johnson
sit, please.

01:39.718 --> 01:41.186
I'm gonna need to speak to
Mike McLusky.

01:41.186 --> 01:42.955
Of course, if you just
wait with the rest...

01:42.955 --> 01:44.523
I don't wait with the rest.

01:45.457 --> 01:47.826
You go tell the mayor
Bunny's cousin's out here.

01:51.930 --> 01:54.166
I didn't lose him.
Okay?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.935
Okay, then where is he?

01:57.336 --> 01:58.470
He's in the system.

01:58.837 --> 02:00.272
- And I'm locating--
- You lost him.

02:00.272 --> 02:01.974
You lost my cousin.

02:01.974 --> 02:02.975
And Rafael.

02:02.975 --> 02:04.710
And I heard all about you.

02:04.710 --> 02:07.713
Fuckin' white savior bullshit.
You ain't savin' shit.

02:08.313 --> 02:10.816
Call a thing a thing, mayor.
Say you lost my people.

02:10.816 --> 02:13.686
You have to understand that
they transferred all the inmates

02:13.686 --> 02:15.020
out of Tent City

02:15.020 --> 02:16.555
into four different locations.

02:17.222 --> 02:19.958
My shop's gonna get hit
no doubt, Bunny stays in.

02:20.926 --> 02:22.294
That shop's important.

02:22.895 --> 02:24.029
To all of us.

02:24.263 --> 02:25.364
Nobody lookin' out.

02:25.364 --> 02:26.799
You don't think they gonna come
to my place

02:26.799 --> 02:28.167
and put a threat on my door?

02:28.634 --> 02:30.169
Ain't nobody mindin'
the neighborhood.

02:30.436 --> 02:31.570
You best get him out.

02:32.271 --> 02:34.006
Or the threat's gonna be comin'
your way, too.

02:34.773 --> 02:37.876
Bunny look after the world.
Know that.

02:39.378 --> 02:41.146
You gotta know that
I'm gonna find him.

02:41.146 --> 02:43.048
Okay?
And I promise you that.

02:43.916 --> 02:45.751
And I'll get him the fuck out.

02:46.518 --> 02:47.686
You understand?

02:49.354 --> 02:50.322
It'll get done.

02:52.458 --> 02:53.959
Okay.

03:10.409 --> 03:11.677
<i>Fuck!</i>

03:15.214 --> 03:16.548
<i>What's going on
down there?</i>

05:27.179 --> 05:28.213
Come on.

05:31.183 --> 05:33.352
- <i>Hey, Mike.</i>
- Hey, you got 20 on Bunny?

05:33.352 --> 05:35.387
I ain't got 20 on
my own fuckin' ass.

05:35.387 --> 05:37.256
They got, like, three yards
here, Mike.

05:37.256 --> 05:40.659
They're gonna ad seg what
could be a whole goddamn prison.

05:40.659 --> 05:42.427
Well, put the word out, okay?

05:42.427 --> 05:44.429
I need to know
where the leaders have landed.

05:44.429 --> 05:45.931
I'm on it, I'm on it.

05:49.468 --> 05:50.402
I got one of 'em.

05:50.402 --> 05:52.704
That one-eyed Blood motherfucker.

05:52.704 --> 05:53.672
Okay.

05:53.672 --> 05:55.040
<i>And...</i>

05:55.574 --> 05:57.542
I got the AB asshole, too.

05:58.844 --> 06:00.145
<i>All right.</i>

06:00.145 --> 06:01.446
All right, well, maybe put 'em
all at Anchor.

06:01.446 --> 06:03.515
All right?
So do a crawl, find Bunny.

06:03.515 --> 06:04.716
All right?
You hear me?

06:04.716 --> 06:05.884
I can't manage this shit

06:05.884 --> 06:07.219
if I don't know where
the leaders are.

06:07.219 --> 06:08.220
Find Bunny!

06:15.494 --> 06:16.628
Oh my!

06:17.930 --> 06:19.431
Okay!

06:20.766 --> 06:22.034
I don't have it!

06:31.510 --> 06:34.613
Mike, my guy at the pawnshop
told him to fuck off.

06:35.113 --> 06:37.215
Well, the only person that will
kill for these bonds

06:37.582 --> 06:39.251
is a person that knows
how to flip 'em.

06:39.251 --> 06:40.752
Fuckin' bank guys, some shit?

06:40.752 --> 06:42.788
More like the guy that stole
'em in the first place.

06:42.788 --> 06:44.623
You're sayin' Milo's
still out there?

06:45.157 --> 06:46.491
If I escaped a prison,

06:46.491 --> 06:48.260
the first thing I'm doin'
is gettin' the hell outta dodge.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.128
Unless there's somethin'
here worth stayin' for.

06:50.495 --> 06:51.563
Did you log 'em in?

06:51.563 --> 06:52.664
The bonds?

06:52.664 --> 06:53.699
Yeah.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.934
Chick came in,
the bullpen was full, man.

06:56.301 --> 06:57.602
Couldn't just chuck 'em
in my truck.

06:57.602 --> 06:59.671
Keep 'em out of the system
as long as you can.

06:59.671 --> 07:00.706
All right?

07:00.706 --> 07:02.207
14 mil...

07:02.207 --> 07:04.376
Very good reason for Milo
to stick around.

07:05.777 --> 07:07.145
All right.
We good?

07:07.446 --> 07:08.947
- Not really...
- Yeah, we're good.

07:08.947 --> 07:10.515
- Lunch is on me.
- We're good, thank you.

07:10.515 --> 07:11.616
I gotta take this call.

07:11.616 --> 07:12.951
- You're good.
- I'll see you guys.

07:12.951 --> 07:14.419
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah.

07:14.419 --> 07:15.654
Hold up a sec.

07:16.488 --> 07:17.756
- Mike.
- What?

07:17.756 --> 07:19.091
Hold up a second.

07:19.091 --> 07:21.727
Hey, why do you give a shit
about Milo, anyway?

07:22.561 --> 07:25.197
I mean...
I mean, fuck him, Mike.

07:25.497 --> 07:26.565
You know?

07:26.565 --> 07:28.333
Let him have this money,
let him fuckin' go.

07:28.333 --> 07:31.036
You know once he's cashed out,
he ain't ever comin' back.

07:31.403 --> 07:34.306
So, let's just, just let
him have his fuckin' money!

07:34.773 --> 07:36.608
Let's do this, let's you and me.

07:36.842 --> 07:39.011
Let's find Bunny, all right?

07:39.011 --> 07:42.848
Let's get his ass out,
let's work together, Mike.

07:42.848 --> 07:45.050
Get shit back to the way it was.

07:45.817 --> 07:47.152
Shit's gotta get right.

07:47.753 --> 07:48.754
Kyle.

07:49.287 --> 07:51.556
We're gonna make shit right.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.326
You and me.
Okay?

07:55.927 --> 07:57.195
Milo...

07:57.796 --> 07:59.131
broke something.

07:59.398 --> 08:01.600
He took it, and he broke it.

08:03.168 --> 08:05.537
And that's why we're not
letting him leave.

08:06.938 --> 08:09.174
But you have to let shit
play out.

08:09.808 --> 08:11.176
Just don't...

08:11.643 --> 08:12.611
Don't fuck with that.

08:15.547 --> 08:16.481
Okay?

08:16.715 --> 08:18.383
I love you, man.
Love you.

09:12.871 --> 09:14.439
What up, Big Hush?

09:14.439 --> 09:16.141
What's the word, dog?

09:17.776 --> 09:18.877
Gettin' in the game, huh?

09:18.877 --> 09:20.345
Ain't no choice, man.

09:20.912 --> 09:22.013
You're ain't lyin'.

09:22.314 --> 09:23.615
You seen my crew?

09:23.949 --> 09:24.983
Fuck...

09:25.383 --> 09:27.352
Big dog, we all your crew now.

09:28.019 --> 09:29.187
Believe that.

09:30.222 --> 09:32.424
We the all blacks now, bruh.

09:34.025 --> 09:35.427
Where Raf at?

09:35.827 --> 09:37.395
Cage, gettin' swole.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.132
All right, man.
I appreciate you, brother.

09:40.132 --> 09:41.500
Yes, sir.

09:47.405 --> 09:48.974
I know that ain't who
I think it is.

09:48.974 --> 09:50.742
Oh, shit.
You better believe it.

09:54.513 --> 09:57.649
Shit, I ain't know you was back
on the block.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.452
Thought your ass would be
out by now.

10:00.452 --> 10:01.786
Me, too.

10:01.786 --> 10:02.921
When did you get here?

10:02.921 --> 10:04.156
Two nights.

10:04.156 --> 10:05.757
I woke up to that jumper.

10:06.525 --> 10:08.126
Shit is fucked up, man.

10:08.460 --> 10:09.728
I figured I'd roll out,
you know,

10:09.728 --> 10:10.829
make my shit felt.

10:11.429 --> 10:12.731
You got family in here.

10:13.565 --> 10:15.734
I was worried they was gonna
ship your ass outta state.

10:16.902 --> 10:19.304
Looks like they put all
the generals in this house.

10:20.472 --> 10:23.141
Yeah, there's gotta be some
design to this shit, man.

10:23.642 --> 10:25.076
Or they just
dumb motherfuckers

10:25.377 --> 10:26.945
who don't know no better.

10:26.945 --> 10:30.148
'Cause Mike can't control
the chaos.

10:31.483 --> 10:33.652
Probably keepin' us close in
case we gotta strategize

10:33.652 --> 10:34.853
or some shit.

10:34.853 --> 10:36.788
That sound like
some hope bullshit to me.

10:39.257 --> 10:40.959
Well, it is what it is.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.828
It ain't about
the circumstances, man.

10:43.828 --> 10:44.963
It's about what you do with it.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.866
Look, man, all I'm sayin' is
we got numbers here.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.436
Motherfuckin' cracker
circle jerkin' half the COs.

10:53.071 --> 10:54.639
Line ain't blurry here.

10:54.973 --> 10:56.474
Line don't exist.

10:58.743 --> 11:01.646
I swear, them AB bitches is
the worst gang on the yard.

11:01.646 --> 11:03.949
Got them fuckin' cowboys
behind 'em.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.251
For now.

11:08.386 --> 11:09.588
What's going on
with the boy?

11:10.722 --> 11:11.957
Oh, shit.

11:14.259 --> 11:16.494
Hey, con down on the yard.
Con down.

11:21.299 --> 11:22.500
Not warring, just down.

11:22.500 --> 11:26.104
Send the med team
for extraction ASAP.

11:48.888 --> 11:51.257
Okay.
I appreciate that.

11:52.892 --> 11:54.560
Okay.
Thanks.

12:31.297 --> 12:32.532
Shit.

12:33.032 --> 12:34.300
"Shit", what?

12:36.636 --> 12:37.570
Hey...

12:39.105 --> 12:40.573
Nothin'.
Just...

12:41.741 --> 12:42.809
They cleared me.

12:43.276 --> 12:44.377
What?

12:44.377 --> 12:47.446
Yeah, for duty.
They cleared me.

12:47.980 --> 12:50.817
I just got the call.

12:51.450 --> 12:54.353
Dash cam was pretty conclusive.

12:55.354 --> 12:56.722
Dead trooper
with a family,

12:56.722 --> 12:58.758
they wanna bury him
with no cloud.

13:00.426 --> 13:03.496
Takin' me back at KPD tomorrow.

13:04.530 --> 13:06.365
Is that what you want?

13:10.970 --> 13:12.038
I don't know.

13:15.308 --> 13:16.876
You wanna work with Mike?

13:18.845 --> 13:19.946
I don't...

13:21.113 --> 13:23.883
...know that, either. I...

13:25.551 --> 13:29.388
I don't know fuckin' anything,
Trac.

13:29.388 --> 13:31.123
It's like, fuck!

13:31.123 --> 13:32.658
Fuck!

13:36.128 --> 13:38.097
I'm gonna be a shitty dad.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.935
No, you're not.

13:42.935 --> 13:44.437
Yeah, I am.

13:45.137 --> 13:46.505
Curse too much.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.646
I read this thing...

13:55.114 --> 13:56.782
I read this thing that said...

13:58.284 --> 14:00.519
the most important job for
a parent

14:00.519 --> 14:01.687
is to be consistent

14:02.188 --> 14:05.992
and to imprint on the kid
what's right and wrong

14:05.992 --> 14:07.493
before they're eight.

14:11.964 --> 14:12.965
It's like...

14:13.766 --> 14:16.168
I don't know what's
fuckin' right anymore.

14:29.415 --> 14:31.417
This needs to be our decision.

14:33.252 --> 14:34.654
You're asking me?

14:35.922 --> 14:36.923
Yeah.

14:39.692 --> 14:41.961
I think you're a long way
from ready.

14:45.665 --> 14:47.667
It's been less than a month.

14:50.236 --> 14:52.438
You need time to heal.

14:54.507 --> 14:56.509
It's all I know, Trac.

15:00.980 --> 15:04.583
You know a lot more than being
a cop.

15:06.652 --> 15:08.120
You know how to be a...

15:09.555 --> 15:10.923
a good husband.

15:11.424 --> 15:12.892
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.928
And a good... son.

15:18.164 --> 15:20.733
And you're going to be
a great fucking dad.

15:25.705 --> 15:27.073
We're gonna be okay.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.975
We're gonna figure this out.

15:41.988 --> 15:43.022
So...

15:44.156 --> 15:46.459
You've been reading
some parenting books?

15:46.459 --> 15:47.994
Shut up.

15:48.861 --> 15:50.496
I read shit.

15:58.871 --> 16:00.573
All right, I'm here.
What?

16:03.409 --> 16:05.644
We got patrol canvassing everywhere.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.685
Shit, we gotta move those bonds.

16:13.219 --> 16:14.787
Okay?

16:14.787 --> 16:16.689
Because if she talked, which
I'm sure she fuckin' did...

16:16.689 --> 16:18.090
they're comin' after us.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.592
They're not breakin' into
the fuckin' PD lockup, Mike.

16:19.592 --> 16:20.960
- You don't think?
- I mean, Mike...

16:20.960 --> 16:22.561
Fuck, he's not wrong,
that's the safest place for 'em.

16:22.561 --> 16:23.829
Like, they just strung
this lady up

16:23.829 --> 16:25.197
in the middle of
the fuckin' day.

16:25.831 --> 16:27.833
No witnesses magically, right?

16:27.833 --> 16:30.102
You think they can't break into
your little Fort Knox?

16:30.703 --> 16:32.004
I mean, come on!

16:32.004 --> 16:34.573
We gotta keep these bonds
moving, okay?

16:34.573 --> 16:36.175
Until we can use them.

16:36.175 --> 16:37.309
So sign them out.

16:37.777 --> 16:39.145
Fuckin' make them go missing,

16:39.145 --> 16:40.713
whatever the fuck you gotta to
do, all right, just...

16:40.713 --> 16:41.680
get 'em the fuck outta there.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.049
- Okay, you got it?
- Got it.

16:43.049 --> 16:44.150
All right.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.785
Oh, by the way, thanks for
inviting me to

16:45.785 --> 16:47.119
your fuckin' haunted house!

16:47.119 --> 16:49.088
I'm gonna stay up all night,
you fuckin' prick.

17:02.868 --> 17:05.371
Nice to see you all,
thank you for coming.

17:05.371 --> 17:06.605
Fuck is this shit now?

17:06.605 --> 17:09.175
Just a little state of
the union.

17:09.175 --> 17:10.843
This ain't your house.

17:11.644 --> 17:13.179
I'm responsible for you...

17:13.846 --> 17:18.451
former Tent City inmates,
future Kingstown Pen prisoners.

17:18.451 --> 17:19.685
That ain't fuckin' us.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.754
What the fuck you talkin' about, man?

17:22.755 --> 17:24.356
We don't know what you are.

17:24.690 --> 17:27.259
Or what you're gonna be.
That's why I'm here.

17:29.962 --> 17:32.198
You thought you'd be walkin'
the streets by now,

17:32.198 --> 17:33.332
hasn't happened.

17:33.332 --> 17:34.733
Yeah, no fuckin' shit.

17:35.468 --> 17:37.036
Can't say when it's gonna happen.

17:38.003 --> 17:40.106
Wasn't my deal, but here we are.

17:40.573 --> 17:42.641
Get fuckin' McLusky in here.

17:43.175 --> 17:45.611
Don't you think if
Mike McLusky could fix this,

17:45.611 --> 17:47.146
he would've fixed it by now?

17:48.781 --> 17:50.349
Here's what we have working.

17:51.217 --> 17:52.751
I do not care about you.

17:52.751 --> 17:55.788
We have no relationship,
we have no past, no future.

17:55.788 --> 17:57.156
We have right now.

17:57.156 --> 17:59.992
I do not know how long
you'll be here,

17:59.992 --> 18:02.228
or how long I'll be your babysitter.

18:02.228 --> 18:03.896
But let's...

18:03.896 --> 18:05.664
try...

18:05.664 --> 18:09.068
to make it as painless for
all of us as possible.

18:11.170 --> 18:12.371
You fuck with me...

18:13.572 --> 18:14.874
I promise...

18:16.675 --> 18:19.879
I will fuck with you ten times
what you bring.

18:22.414 --> 18:24.183
Welcome to prison.

18:39.832 --> 18:42.635
Fuck McLusky.

18:44.236 --> 18:45.771
I'm done with that bitch.

18:46.939 --> 18:49.241
We're gonna run shit like
we run shit now.

19:29.576 --> 19:30.844
Knock, knock.

19:30.844 --> 19:32.979
- Can we help you?
- Oh, look who it is.

19:32.979 --> 19:34.915
Baby, this is the
goddamn mayor himself.

19:35.682 --> 19:36.783
You got some news for me?

19:36.783 --> 19:38.318
You better have some
good news for me.

19:38.318 --> 19:39.519
I'm just checking in.

19:39.519 --> 19:40.954
I thought you was 5-0.

19:40.954 --> 19:42.522
Mm-mm, he ain't the police.

19:42.789 --> 19:43.957
Nope.

19:44.524 --> 19:45.625
Is everything okay?

19:46.259 --> 19:48.462
Be a whole lot better after
my cousin's outta that hole.

19:48.462 --> 19:49.696
You find where he's at?

19:49.696 --> 19:51.331
Yeah, no,
I got all eyes on him.

19:52.499 --> 19:54.301
Look, I made a promise to you.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.336
I plan to keep it,
like it or not.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.272
I said I was gonna look after
your shop, I'm doin' that.

19:59.940 --> 20:03.276
I said I was gonna get
Bunny out, I'll do that too.

20:03.643 --> 20:05.445
So, this is you lookin' out?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.647
Let me tell you somethin'.

20:07.647 --> 20:09.182
Maybe you so pretty

20:09.182 --> 20:10.951
you ain't ever had to worry
about real shit.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.820
But you showin' up
and you lookin' out?

20:14.221 --> 20:15.756
Two very different fuckin'
things.

20:16.289 --> 20:17.991
These bangers decide to step
inside Bunny's world,

20:17.991 --> 20:19.626
you ain't doin' nothin' but
addin' another body bag

20:19.626 --> 20:20.627
to the pile.

20:20.994 --> 20:23.196
Like, come on.
You serious?

20:23.730 --> 20:25.465
You really think you doin'
somethin'.

20:25.465 --> 20:26.733
Look...

20:26.733 --> 20:29.136
Rhonda, you don't know me
very well.

20:29.136 --> 20:30.070
Okay?

20:30.070 --> 20:32.372
So, let me just tell you this.

20:33.039 --> 20:35.709
When I say I do a thing...

20:35.709 --> 20:37.244
the thing gets fuckin' done.

20:38.478 --> 20:40.847
So, yeah.
I'm lookin' out.

20:42.983 --> 20:45.485
Here's my number.
Any problems...

20:47.287 --> 20:48.221
You call me.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.525
Okay.

20:52.692 --> 20:54.194
Have a good day.

20:58.198 --> 20:59.666
Why'd he trust you?

20:59.666 --> 21:00.700
What's that?

21:00.700 --> 21:01.835
Bunny don't trust nobody,

21:01.835 --> 21:03.503
but he trust
your fine white ass.

21:03.503 --> 21:04.538
Why?

21:05.772 --> 21:06.973
I don't know, Rhonda.

21:06.973 --> 21:08.875
Okay, why do you trust him?

21:11.311 --> 21:12.479
Have a great day.

21:13.980 --> 21:15.549
I'll be back.

21:35.001 --> 21:36.403
Hey, Kareem.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.843
I just went by your office,
and they said you were leavin'.

21:43.410 --> 21:44.678
Which I did.

21:44.678 --> 21:45.979
All right.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.248
You got a second?

21:49.216 --> 21:51.084
I'm standin' here
talkin' to you.

21:51.418 --> 21:52.586
We had an inmate.

21:53.253 --> 21:56.723
Took him to the infirmary,
he had a seizure on the yard.

21:56.723 --> 21:58.191
Tent City transfer?

21:58.191 --> 21:59.326
Yeah.

21:59.326 --> 22:02.729
They took him to ICU for
exploratory surgery.

22:03.029 --> 22:04.431
Wasn't an OD?

22:05.465 --> 22:07.500
We can write it that way,
if we want.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.835
Well, why wouldn't we?

22:08.835 --> 22:12.272
I mean, maybe somethin'
ruptured when he spasmed,

22:12.272 --> 22:14.774
maybe the crank's
eating away at his gut.

22:14.774 --> 22:16.543
But you're sayin' that's not it.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.512
I'm sayin' policy is he dies...

22:19.512 --> 22:20.847
they autopsy him.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.483
Short of that,
docs examining him,

22:23.483 --> 22:26.486
and they're gonna find
a fuck ton of trauma.

22:26.486 --> 22:28.889
Okay, so someone put a beatdown
on him.

22:29.155 --> 22:31.291
Mexicans, blacks, his own.

22:31.291 --> 22:33.093
Yeah, we can write it
that way, too.

22:33.093 --> 22:35.362
Just, just be fucking plain,
Carney!

22:35.362 --> 22:38.131
- He's one of the three.
- Three what?!

22:45.171 --> 22:47.407
And he's been leakin'
ever since.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.010
Don't worry, I got you.

22:50.010 --> 22:52.646
I just want you to know,
in case, you know...

22:55.315 --> 22:56.449
I got you.

22:57.450 --> 22:58.251
Thank you.

23:27.175 --> 23:29.110
He's looking for you.

23:31.446 --> 23:32.246
What?

23:32.246 --> 23:34.182
He asked me to bring you to him.

23:35.583 --> 23:36.984
I'll drive myself.

23:37.752 --> 23:39.287
He wants me to drive you.

23:39.754 --> 23:42.957
Special ride.
For VIP.

24:19.861 --> 24:21.629
<i>You killed him.</i>

24:33.541 --> 24:34.609
I...

24:36.277 --> 24:38.145
tried to make him talk.

24:40.147 --> 24:41.549
He said nothing.

24:43.484 --> 24:46.120
And after you killed him,
he really said nothing.

24:49.023 --> 24:50.591
Now you say nothing.

24:51.726 --> 24:55.530
I tried.
For you, I tried.

24:56.097 --> 24:57.298
You failed.

24:58.933 --> 25:01.702
For me.
And the woman?

25:03.337 --> 25:06.507
She, too, didn't talk,
so you killed her.

25:07.708 --> 25:08.676
Yeah.

25:08.676 --> 25:09.744
What?

25:10.778 --> 25:11.746
I'm sorry.

25:15.483 --> 25:18.119
Had you been able to make
this man talk...

25:19.921 --> 25:21.622
Had you found my money...

25:23.824 --> 25:25.526
You'd have brought it to me.

25:28.629 --> 25:30.431
Yes, yes, of course.

25:38.339 --> 25:40.675
I want to forgive you, Joseph.

25:41.809 --> 25:42.843
I do.

25:45.146 --> 25:46.747
Please, Milo...

25:47.682 --> 25:48.950
Let me fix this.

25:48.950 --> 25:50.918
No, no.

25:51.218 --> 25:52.853
It's up to me, now.

25:57.091 --> 25:58.826
I'll fix it.

26:36.764 --> 26:38.165
Bunny.

26:38.165 --> 26:39.800
<i>Bunny.</i>

26:43.104 --> 26:44.605
<i>Take the fuckin' phone.</i>

26:48.109 --> 26:50.111
- <i>Hey.</i>
- You got news for me?

26:50.511 --> 26:51.846
We tried to find you.

26:51.846 --> 26:53.614
<i>Yeah, well, you found me
now, Mike.</i>

26:53.614 --> 26:55.249
- The fuck you gonna do?
- <i>Yeah...</i>

26:55.783 --> 26:58.619
Well, your cousin came in to
visit me today at the office.

27:00.488 --> 27:01.722
Oh, shit.

27:02.323 --> 27:03.357
Now you gone and done it.

27:03.357 --> 27:04.525
<i>Yeah, so listen.</i>

27:04.525 --> 27:06.794
I'm gonna get you out, okay?

27:07.395 --> 27:09.263
<i>I got an angle on, on, on
somethin',</i>

27:09.263 --> 27:10.698
<i>it's gonna pay out here.</i>

27:10.698 --> 27:12.466
<i>It's gonna take me a minute,
so meanwhile,</i>

27:12.466 --> 27:13.934
I'm gonna get you set to
earn inside.

27:13.934 --> 27:16.370
Okay, so you can take care of
your family on the outside.

27:16.370 --> 27:19.140
It's the least you can do, Mike.
That ain't no fuckin' favor.

27:19.140 --> 27:20.307
- <i>I know.
-</i> Bunny!

27:20.307 --> 27:21.842
- <i>Yeah...</i>
- <i>Bunny!</i>

27:21.842 --> 27:22.943
<i>Give me the fuckin' phone.</i>

27:22.943 --> 27:24.378
Hey, look, hey...

27:24.378 --> 27:26.881
<i>Give it right now.
Give it to me!</i>

28:46.155 --> 28:48.858
How in the fuck are they gone?!

28:48.858 --> 28:50.226
<i>How does that happen?!</i>

28:50.226 --> 28:52.295
I went in this morning to sign
'em out, and they're gone.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.529
Where, where did you go
this morning?

28:53.529 --> 28:54.797
Why didn't you just go yesterday,

28:54.797 --> 28:55.798
when we talked about it?

28:55.798 --> 28:57.367
- <i>Huh?</i>
- Hey, hey.

28:57.367 --> 28:58.801
The afternoon guy is
a fuckin' prick.

28:58.801 --> 29:00.136
<i>-</i> Jesus Christ...
<i>- All right?</i>

29:00.136 --> 29:01.404
I figured that they were just gonna...

29:01.404 --> 29:02.739
Are there cameras in there?

29:02.739 --> 29:03.840
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:03.840 --> 29:04.641
All right.
Go, now!

29:04.641 --> 29:05.908
You understand me?
Now!

29:05.908 --> 29:07.143
Not later.

29:07.143 --> 29:09.245
Not fuckin' tomorrow morning!
Right?

29:09.245 --> 29:11.080
Go now, and figure out
who the fuck took 'em.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.215
Okay, goddamn it.

29:12.215 --> 29:13.249
- <i>Got it?</i>
- Okay!

29:13.249 --> 29:14.617
Anybody else know about this?

29:14.617 --> 29:17.220
No, I just, I said I was lookin'
for a deposition, man.

29:17.220 --> 29:18.488
<i>All right, good.</i>

29:18.488 --> 29:20.156
Get that recording,
find out who took it,

29:20.423 --> 29:21.958
and make those tapes disappear.

29:21.958 --> 29:23.559
- Understand me?
- Mike!

29:23.559 --> 29:24.694
<i>Got it?
You can do it.</i>

29:24.694 --> 29:26.095
- Mike how am I...?
- <i>Hey, hey.</i>

29:26.095 --> 29:27.997
Come on, Stevie.
Really?

29:28.197 --> 29:29.165
Get it done.

29:29.165 --> 29:30.300
- Okay.
- <i>Great.</i>

29:30.300 --> 29:31.968
Amazing.
Thank you.

29:31.968 --> 29:33.069
Fuck!

29:37.106 --> 29:39.242
Charlie Pickings
says he's got information

29:39.242 --> 29:41.678
he'll only share with you, Detective.

29:41.678 --> 29:43.346
Open.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.785
What's with
the food?

29:48.785 --> 29:50.687
I'm gonna trade
burgers for bodies.

30:00.063 --> 30:01.097
Thank you.

30:02.332 --> 30:03.733
Charlie, how you holdin' up?

30:05.001 --> 30:08.271
Been tryin' to read more,
been journaling.

30:08.271 --> 30:09.939
Mm-hm.
Good.

30:12.075 --> 30:13.376
I don't drink dairy.

30:13.676 --> 30:15.912
Oh, no, that's, that's for me.

30:18.114 --> 30:19.315
Veggie burger?

30:19.315 --> 30:20.350
100 percent.
I know what you like.

30:20.350 --> 30:21.484
No onions, right?

30:24.721 --> 30:27.023
And Charlie, I'm sorry,
they would've been hotter.

30:27.023 --> 30:28.424
I drove as fast as I could.

30:28.424 --> 30:30.393
This is really good.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.861
That's good.

30:31.861 --> 30:33.029
Mm.

30:38.868 --> 30:40.002
There's...

30:40.002 --> 30:41.471
one in Ohio.

30:42.338 --> 30:43.706
Is that okay?

30:46.376 --> 30:48.778
Yeah, Charlie. Look...

30:50.446 --> 30:51.881
They got cops in Ohio.

30:52.715 --> 30:55.184
We'll make a couple calls.
Okay?

30:55.551 --> 30:57.186
- Do I have to go?
- No.

30:57.186 --> 30:58.254
No.

30:58.588 --> 31:00.890
We'll write up a confession.

31:01.824 --> 31:03.092
They'll come to you for
the specifics.

31:03.092 --> 31:05.328
Look, what you're doin' here,
Charlie, is a good thing.

31:05.328 --> 31:07.130
It's a really good thing.
It's important.

31:08.331 --> 31:09.365
You know, you're findin',

31:09.365 --> 31:10.900
you're findin' closure for yourself.

31:11.634 --> 31:13.169
And for the families.

31:15.471 --> 31:16.906
It was...

31:17.540 --> 31:19.041
a really bad one.

31:20.243 --> 31:21.511
He's...

31:22.378 --> 31:24.547
in a couple different places.

31:43.499 --> 31:44.834
Warden?

31:47.069 --> 31:49.639
I'm Kingstown.
This man is Anchor Bay.

31:50.106 --> 31:52.809
He was one of my inmates
in the Tents.

31:54.310 --> 31:55.244
Good kid.

31:56.145 --> 31:57.079
If you say so.

31:58.314 --> 31:59.849
We're all sewn up here.

31:59.849 --> 32:02.685
Doctor won't risk defamation
or libel, but...

32:02.919 --> 32:04.220
You should get ahead of this.

32:04.787 --> 32:07.056
I've already briefed the warden
at Anchor, but...

32:07.590 --> 32:09.258
He's sayin' he's yours.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.248
Sit.

32:44.093 --> 32:45.294
<i>Pick up the phone?</i>

32:45.294 --> 32:47.330
<i>No.</i>

32:47.330 --> 32:48.631
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

32:48.631 --> 32:50.099
Pick up
the fuckin' phone.

32:52.268 --> 32:53.769
<i>Jesus Christ, Bunny.</i>

32:58.441 --> 33:01.110
You better have brought me
a cake with a nail file in it.

33:01.444 --> 33:03.412
Yeah.
Tryin', Bunny.

33:03.412 --> 33:04.614
Yeah, I see how that work, Mike.

33:04.914 --> 33:06.649
I'm gonna have to do shit
my way.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.417
No, listen.

33:09.051 --> 33:11.220
I have somethin' to offer
the DA.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.388
Okay?

33:12.388 --> 33:13.956
And I'm gonna get
you outta here.

33:13.956 --> 33:15.925
Would you just tell the rest?

33:17.727 --> 33:19.795
The rest ain't as open-minded,
Mike.

33:19.795 --> 33:20.930
Well, we're making it happen.

33:20.930 --> 33:22.832
I don't doubt that you think so.

33:25.701 --> 33:28.271
But I, I can't bide my time, Mike.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.609
What is happening?

33:35.144 --> 33:36.312
Bunny?

33:38.014 --> 33:41.183
Don't fuck this up.
Don't start doin' shit.

33:41.183 --> 33:42.485
It's all good.

33:42.485 --> 33:43.586
- Yeah.
- <i></i> Yeah.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.121
You think?

33:45.121 --> 33:47.523
Look, it don't take all day
to recognize sunset, Mike.

33:48.424 --> 33:52.061
Bunny, we're this fuckin' close.
You understand me?

33:52.828 --> 33:53.963
Just stay the course.

33:53.963 --> 33:56.432
What fucking course, Mike?
Huh?

33:56.699 --> 33:59.335
You ain't got shit!

33:59.335 --> 34:00.503
Nothin'!

34:01.037 --> 34:03.806
The only course I see
is the one I'm makin'.

34:03.806 --> 34:05.274
What the fuck does that mean?

34:05.708 --> 34:07.577
Don't, don't do, don't do
somethin' stupid.

34:07.577 --> 34:08.844
You good.

34:08.844 --> 34:10.179
<i></i> Don't do somethin'
stupid.

34:10.179 --> 34:11.447
Matter of fact,
don't do fuckin' anything.

34:11.447 --> 34:12.281
- How's that?
- You good, Mike.

34:12.281 --> 34:13.616
Okay?

34:13.616 --> 34:14.951
- I got you.
- No Bunny, I know that face.

34:14.951 --> 34:16.652
You work on your end,
I'll work on mine.

34:16.652 --> 34:18.521
- Come on, come on.
- It's all good.

34:18.821 --> 34:20.289
Done, cornstalk.
Let's go.

34:36.405 --> 34:37.640
Fuck is this?

34:37.640 --> 34:39.175
Yeah, we'll take him back.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.344
I got it handled, CO.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.580
I don't give a shit how many
years you got with DOC,

34:44.580 --> 34:46.248
you're a new fuckin' fish here.

34:46.248 --> 34:47.350
You understand?

34:48.284 --> 34:49.685
Big boy.

34:49.685 --> 34:51.354
We take you easy or we take you
on a stretcher.

34:51.354 --> 34:52.622
Where the fuck you takin' me?

34:52.622 --> 34:54.290
Well, you're worried for
your safety, right?

34:54.590 --> 34:56.192
The fuck?

34:56.192 --> 34:57.827
I got it written down somewhere
you're worried for your safety,

34:57.827 --> 34:59.061
and that's for ad seg.

34:59.061 --> 35:00.529
- Bullshit.
- I got a report!

35:00.529 --> 35:02.098
- This is my fucking inmate!
- Back the fuck up!

35:02.098 --> 35:03.666
Yeah, fuck this, fuck you,
fuck all...

35:03.666 --> 35:05.701
Ah, fuck!

35:06.435 --> 35:07.903
- Bunny!
- What the fuck?!

35:07.903 --> 35:09.572
Bunny, go with them,
I will handle this.

35:10.039 --> 35:11.607
Fuck, you stupid-ass...

35:11.607 --> 35:14.010
Hey!
He wasn't fucking resisting, CO!

35:14.010 --> 35:16.078
You with the ACLU, Carney?

35:16.078 --> 35:17.480
I swear to God!

35:17.480 --> 35:18.781
Get the fuck out my face.

35:18.781 --> 35:20.850
Get the fuck off me,
you stupid bitch!

35:20.850 --> 35:22.985
Move, bitches!

35:25.287 --> 35:27.757
We're gonna get you
some alone time, son.

35:33.996 --> 35:35.731
Where the fuck you takin' me?!
Man, no!

35:35.731 --> 35:39.735
No, fuck this, fuck you,
fuck all of this shit, man!

35:39.735 --> 35:41.637
That's the motherfucking
kill box you putting me in!

35:41.637 --> 35:42.905
I ain't goin' in there!

35:46.776 --> 35:48.711
Gunner wants you off the floor
for this move.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.013
Don't make sense to me,
but it's his yard.

35:51.013 --> 35:52.948
Guess he's okay makin' this
an Oreo house.

35:54.850 --> 35:56.786
The beatdown was a bonus for me.

35:56.786 --> 35:59.488
Fuck you!
No! Fuck that!

36:00.589 --> 36:02.358
Fuck that!

36:05.928 --> 36:07.930
Sit tight, precious.

36:22.311 --> 36:23.579
I just talked to you.

36:23.579 --> 36:26.382
Shit just went fucking sideways.

36:26.382 --> 36:27.750
<i>A couple of dickhead COs</i>

36:27.750 --> 36:30.653
just took Bunny off me,
and they put a beatdown on him.

36:30.653 --> 36:32.354
<i>Mike, they took his ass
to solitary.</i>

36:32.354 --> 36:34.690
- Get him the fuck out.
- It's not my call, Mike.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.225
Look, all right.
Never mind.

36:36.225 --> 36:37.393
<i>Mike...</i>

36:44.967 --> 36:46.602
<i>This is Kareem,
leave a message.</i>

36:46.602 --> 36:48.070
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

37:13.496 --> 37:14.997
What the fuck?!

38:13.596 --> 38:15.798
I just wanna take
a minute of your time to, um,

38:15.798 --> 38:17.266
talk about our arrangement.

38:17.266 --> 38:18.868
<i>These people present
a meance to society.</i>

38:18.868 --> 38:20.136
<i>Now, why would I release them?</i>

38:20.136 --> 38:21.504
Because you made a fuckin'
deal with them.

38:21.504 --> 38:23.873
Deals are made and broken
all the time, Mr. McLusky.

38:23.873 --> 38:26.008
I got a heart attack letter.
Fuckin' DA.

38:26.008 --> 38:27.543
- They're coming for me.
- They ain't coming after you

38:27.543 --> 38:29.779
because of inmate testimony.
Someone rolled.

38:29.779 --> 38:32.181
Who gives a fuck
if it looks suspicious

38:32.181 --> 38:34.150
as long as it doesn't
come back on us?

38:34.150 --> 38:36.018
You ain't doin' for me,
so I gotta raise my voice now.

38:36.018 --> 38:37.420
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't.

38:37.420 --> 38:40.490
Help me help you,
Brother Mike.
