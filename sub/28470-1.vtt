03:44.042 --> 03:45.083
Lila.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.917
You're in the hospital.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.625
You had an accident, but everything's OK.

03:59.167 --> 04:01.167
You're fine, don't worry.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.042
Lila, sweetheart.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.333
Do you know who I am?

04:16.583 --> 04:18.083
Do you know your name?

05:10.583 --> 05:11.625
Hi.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.167
I'm Blanca.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.458
I'm a friend of yours.

05:19.583 --> 05:23.125
Yesterday I went to your house
to talk to you about work.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.000
While I made calls,
you went down to the beach.

05:29.917 --> 05:32.042
You were taking too long,
so I went to look for you.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.625
Then I saw you'd fainted
in the water.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.917
Do you like it?

05:47.708 --> 05:48.833
I make them myself.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.292
I can teach you, if you want.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.417
It's easier to undo it,
and then redo it again.

06:02.542 --> 06:05.958
We can follow the pattern
and make it like it was before.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.333
Do you know who it is?

06:17.042 --> 06:18.042
It's...

06:19.333 --> 06:20.375
Shakira.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.042
Do you know who she is?

06:49.833 --> 06:50.958
Lily.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.125
Lila Cassen.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.458
Don't worry, Lila.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.125
Who are you?

07:50.042 --> 07:51.333
I'm Blanca.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.000
- You're Blanca.
- That's right.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.000
- Are you my friend?
- Yes.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.500
- Do I have a house?
- Of course.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.125
Then I want to go home.

09:02.875 --> 09:08.375
WHO WILL SING TO YOU

09:36.708 --> 09:38.167
Did you picture it like this?

09:39.833 --> 09:41.125
I didn't picture anything.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.250
It will be just the two of us.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.542
I told César
to take some time off.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.250
- Who's César?
- Your personal assistant.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.708
A house like this
needs people to take care of it.

09:54.167 --> 09:56.417
While he's gone,
I'll take care of everything.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.625
I'm going to make something to eat.

10:00.042 --> 10:01.500
Do you want some crudités?

10:01.792 --> 10:02.875
Some what?

10:03.208 --> 10:04.708
Some crudités.

10:06.042 --> 10:09.375
Raw vegetables.
Carrots, celery, cucumber. Raw.

10:09.792 --> 10:10.958
Why raw?

10:11.708 --> 10:12.988
Because you're a raw food vegan.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.792
- I'm what?
- A raw food vegan.

10:15.583 --> 10:19.250
You eat raw things because
you think it's better for your body.

10:20.042 --> 10:21.458
Meat, too?

10:22.250 --> 10:24.333
You don't eat meat.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.542
Want me
to make you something else?

10:29.500 --> 10:30.750
A fried egg?

10:31.958 --> 10:34.083
OK, I'm going to the kitchen.

10:34.708 --> 10:35.958
Take a look around the house.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.625
- I'll get you in a bit.
- Blanca.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.333
Yes?

10:40.083 --> 10:41.250
Where's the bathroom?

12:13.458 --> 12:14.738
What did you want to talk about?

12:15.917 --> 12:16.917
What?

12:17.250 --> 12:20.000
Before I went to the beach
and you found me in the water.

12:20.625 --> 12:23.792
You said you came to talk about work.

12:24.833 --> 12:25.833
But...

12:26.625 --> 12:28.042
I'm retired.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.583
You don't have
to worry about that right now.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.750
When should I start worrying?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.667
I planned to wait
a few days to discuss it.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.458
I...

12:44.208 --> 12:45.958
I'd rather discuss it now.

12:47.583 --> 12:48.583
OK.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.833
You haven't sung in ten years.

12:57.833 --> 13:01.833
You've just been
living off of album royalties,

13:01.958 --> 13:03.333
but that's not so easy now.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.750
Without doing concerts, it's almost
impossible to live off of music.

13:06.917 --> 13:09.167
Or at least, live this way.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.125
So we scheduled
your return to the stage.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.500
Ten concerts, for now.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.417
The first is in two months, in Madrid.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.083
What if I don't sing again?

13:27.917 --> 13:29.958
First, you'd have to sell this house.

13:31.042 --> 13:32.875
Then there are several options.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.333
You could disappear,
start a new life away from it all.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.083
Or make a living on talk shows.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.583
Lots of singers end up doing that.

13:42.083 --> 13:45.083
But it's because they need to,
and you don't.

13:45.417 --> 13:48.042
- Why not?
- Because you have talent.

13:50.708 --> 13:52.542
Then why did I stop singing?

13:55.125 --> 13:56.792
Because your mother died.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.167
I've been with you for 25 years.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.125
I'm not leaving you now.

14:08.167 --> 14:09.875
No one matters to me as much as you.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.042
No one matters more to me
than Lila Cassen.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.417
<i>Naked</i>

15:05.833 --> 15:08.875
<i>This golden</i>

15:09.292 --> 15:10.667

15:11.625 --> 15:14.208

15:18.583 --> 15:21.250

15:21.542 --> 15:23.542

15:25.958 --> 15:30.625

15:54.708 --> 15:56.208
<i>I'll whisper...</i>

16:39.458 --> 16:40.542
It was my secret.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.333
You hate tobacco. Do you mind?

16:52.167 --> 16:54.167
Nobody becomes Lila in one day.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.000
Not even you.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.458
Since I woke up at the hospital,

17:01.542 --> 17:02.875
I feel a...

17:03.625 --> 17:05.458
A rhythm, constantly.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.333
It's a faraway song

17:11.625 --> 17:13.790
that echoes in everything.

17:15.290 --> 17:16.458
In the floor,

17:16.915 --> 17:18.290
in the walls.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.625
I want to listen to it,

17:23.958 --> 17:25.165
but I can't.

17:27.540 --> 17:28.833
I can only feel it.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.875
Like a heartbeat.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.042
All the time.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.958
Can you feel it?

18:02.917 --> 18:05.417
Because it's going to burst my insides.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.875
Do you know
what a tomato with a cape and a mask is?

18:18.167 --> 18:19.167
No.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.750
Supertomato.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.958
And a potato with a cape and a mask?

18:28.917 --> 18:30.250
Superpotato.

18:30.708 --> 18:31.750
No.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.542
A potato dressed up like Supertomato.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.417
That's awful.

18:41.292 --> 18:42.958
You're the one who told it to me.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.458
And who am I?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.042
You're unique.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.625
LILA CASSEN UNIQUE

21:12.958 --> 21:14.375
<i>Naked</i>

21:14.958 --> 21:17.875
<i>This golden</i>

21:18.417 --> 21:19.958
<i>Tissue</i>

21:20.708 --> 21:23.292
<i>To where my hand</i>

21:23.708 --> 21:25.333
<i>Reaches</i>

21:28.125 --> 21:30.333
<i>I'll whisper again</i>

21:30.625 --> 21:32.458
<i>At your side</i>

21:35.292 --> 21:40.292
<i>We're a new guest</i>

21:42.792 --> 21:45.083
<i>Give me back the air</i>

21:45.958 --> 21:48.917
<i>That you brought close</i>

21:49.708 --> 21:52.500
<i>Grab my hair</i>

21:53.167 --> 21:56.708
<i>Swim through me</i>

21:56.875 --> 21:59.625
<i>If you find no water</i>

22:00.542 --> 22:03.375
<i>Spread your wings</i>

22:03.833 --> 22:06.167
<i>Fly to me</i>

22:07.458 --> 22:09.750
<i>Fly to me</i>

22:11.833 --> 22:16.208
<i>The beast is on my side</i>

23:38.708 --> 23:40.667
You must have
heard it a thousand times.

23:41.625 --> 23:44.000
- Excuse me?
- You look a lot like a singer.

23:44.958 --> 23:45.958
Oh, yeah?

23:46.625 --> 23:47.958
Tina Turner?

23:48.583 --> 23:49.583
Close.

23:50.208 --> 23:51.833
But the one I mean is Spanish.

23:52.375 --> 23:55.542
She was famous in the 90s,
they say she eats live animals.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.875
That's what they say?

23:57.167 --> 23:58.333
That's what I've heard.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.125
I still don't know who.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.167
Her name starts with an L.

24:03.750 --> 24:04.750
No clue.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.333
She's got a song called "Wild Orchid."

24:11.958 --> 24:14.167
If you guess right,
then I'll leave you alone.

24:16.458 --> 24:17.583
Lila Cassen.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.083
That's it.

24:21.250 --> 24:24.417
Then I'll hold up my end,
and be on my way to the bathroom.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.958
I thought I'd found
another Lila Cassen fan

24:27.083 --> 24:30.000
in some lost club in Rota
and I just had to meet her.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.875
You're a Lila Cassen fan.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.083
A big one.

24:35.625 --> 24:36.792
A big one?

24:38.417 --> 24:39.958
If you were a Lila Cassen fan,

24:40.083 --> 24:42.208
you wouldn't have used
"Wild Orchid" as an example.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.625
Why not?

24:43.875 --> 24:45.125
Because it isn't hers.

24:45.417 --> 24:48.208
It's a cover.
It was Lisa Tornatto's, from the 60s.

24:48.792 --> 24:49.917
Whoops.

24:50.333 --> 24:54.750
And you would have never mentioned
the urban myth about live animals.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.250
That's taboo.

24:56.542 --> 24:59.125
I confess, I'm an accidental fan.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.250
What's that mean?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.417
I have Lila Cassen's albums,

25:03.583 --> 25:06.708
but they were left by my ex.
She never came back for them.

25:08.250 --> 25:11.583
Then either she wasn't a big fan
or you were an awful boyfriend.

25:14.792 --> 25:19.167
So why is a horrible boyfriend,
accidental Lila Cassen fan, in Rota?

25:20.375 --> 25:21.583
I sell dolls.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.708
You know the TV show “Chorly y Procket”?

25:26.167 --> 25:28.458
The series with hidden
Satanic messages?

25:28.958 --> 25:30.792
That's an urban myth.

25:32.917 --> 25:35.042
I owed you,
because of the live animal thing.

25:36.583 --> 25:39.750
Well, I'm the merchandising boss.
There's a convention in Cadiz.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.542
What do you do
at a doll salesman convention?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.958
Mainly sell licenses
to make all sorts of useless shit.

25:48.125 --> 25:51.458
Phone cases, slippers, T-shirts...

25:51.625 --> 25:55.583
We get advice from educators
so we won't feel so miserable.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.292
What kind of advice?

25:58.500 --> 26:02.167
For example, what the dolls say
when you push their tummy.

26:05.458 --> 26:07.667
I've got the perfect thing
for your dolls to say.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.250
Are you an educator?

26:10.708 --> 26:11.708
No.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.083
What do you do?

26:14.583 --> 26:16.125
I work at a karaoke bar.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.333
I'm all ears.

26:22.917 --> 26:27.375
"You're probably
mediocre and run-of-the-mill.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.917
Don't waste your time on effort,
or trying to be special.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.792
Spend it accepting reality.

26:36.417 --> 26:37.542
That way,

26:38.708 --> 26:41.042
even if you're not entirely happy,

26:42.500 --> 26:46.750
at least you won't be miserable
the rest of your life."

26:49.167 --> 26:50.292
What do you think?

26:51.958 --> 26:53.375
A little long.

26:53.958 --> 26:57.333
But I think every child in Spain
should hear that message.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.500
I'm going to the bathroom,
then to dance.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.250
Will you dance with me?

27:07.958 --> 27:09.000
No.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.750
But I might watch you from up here.

27:16.625 --> 27:18.542
It's been a pleasure. I'm Nicolás.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.375
I'm Violeta.

27:50.917 --> 27:54.333
<i>If you try it, you can shine.</i>

29:22.958 --> 29:24.750
What happened to the door?

29:28.583 --> 29:29.917
Marta, I'm talking to you.

29:31.542 --> 29:32.583
It broke.

29:33.083 --> 29:36.125
I can see that.
What I want to know is how it broke.

29:42.333 --> 29:43.542
Did it break on its own?

29:49.417 --> 29:51.833
Could you throw the shells
in an ashtray?

30:19.250 --> 30:20.625
Forget it, I'll do it.

30:58.333 --> 30:59.958
I need a new phone.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.958
You bought one last year.
Did it break on its own, too?

31:04.250 --> 31:06.792
It's not broken,
but it takes fucking shitty pictures.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.958
The pictures are worse one year later?

31:09.208 --> 31:12.250
No, but everyone else's phones
take better pictures.

31:14.083 --> 31:15.083
Fine.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.208
If you're in the picture,
I'm sure it isn't shitty.

31:21.625 --> 31:22.917
Are you screwing with me?

31:23.042 --> 31:25.000
No, Marta. That was a compliment.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.417
Less compliments,
and give me more money.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.125
I'm talking to you.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.750
What can I say, Marta?
I told you: get a job like me.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.958
The last thing I want is to be like you.

31:49.417 --> 31:50.417
What are you doing?

31:50.542 --> 31:53.792
If you won't give me money,
I'll find it on my own, don't worry.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.333
Stop it, Marta.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.375
- Where's your card?
- There is no card.

32:00.542 --> 32:01.542
What do you mean?

32:01.750 --> 32:04.790
The bank cancelled it. I've been paying
off the debt for the past two months.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.958
- Then take your money out.
- I don't have any money here.

32:08.167 --> 32:10.000
- You don't have money in the house?
- No.

32:19.583 --> 32:22.000
Mar...! Marta!

32:27.042 --> 32:28.917
- Marta, stop for a second.
- Don't touch me!

32:29.625 --> 32:31.208
Touch me and I'll fucking go nuts.

32:31.375 --> 32:32.875
Don't even think about touching me.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.500
Where is it?

32:42.792 --> 32:43.958
There is no money, Marta.

32:44.208 --> 32:45.625
Where is it?

32:45.875 --> 32:46.958
I'm being serious.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.333
Fucking liar.

32:48.542 --> 32:50.292
Who told you I've got money here?

32:50.875 --> 32:52.917
I know you do.
Now you know I know, too.

32:52.958 --> 32:54.958
So quit lying
and give me the fucking money.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.750
Marta, there is no money.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.958
Where's the money?

33:22.958 --> 33:24.167
Don't start with that.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.792
I will start.
Where's the fucking money?

33:30.042 --> 33:32.417
Marta, stop it.
You're going to hurt yourself.

33:32.792 --> 33:34.250
You don't think I'd do it?

33:36.042 --> 33:37.750
You don't think I would, do you?

33:39.625 --> 33:40.792
Marta!

33:41.875 --> 33:44.125
I'd do it just to fuck your life over.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.875
So how's that.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.875
It's in Lila's album.

34:24.042 --> 34:25.833
Why do you always lie to me?

34:26.458 --> 34:27.750
Always!

34:38.792 --> 34:40.625
"For wonderful Violeta."

34:45.917 --> 34:48.458
Why'd you buy it
if you don't even have a record player?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.542
To talk to her.

35:04.792 --> 35:07.417
Think twice next time you lie to me.

35:15.208 --> 35:18.875
FOR WONDERFUL VIOLETA
LILA

35:49.750 --> 35:50.958
<i>I'll follow</i>

35:51.750 --> 35:53.750
<i>The trail blindly</i>

35:54.167 --> 35:56.625
<i>I'll find you</i>

35:59.000 --> 36:01.792
<i>I'll rise high</i>

36:02.333 --> 36:06.333
<i>I'll plummet, and I'll find you</i>

36:08.500 --> 36:10.417
<i>Like an animal</i>

36:10.917 --> 36:15.917
<i>In combat, I'll find you</i>

36:18.625 --> 36:21.958
<i>I felt the wind</i>

36:22.917 --> 36:24.833
<i>On my face</i>

36:28.375 --> 36:32.250
<i>I saw the wolves</i>

36:32.542 --> 36:34.208

36:37.250 --> 36:39.750
<i>In the darkness</i>

36:42.167 --> 36:44.292
<i>I tried to breathe</i>

36:47.625 --> 36:53.167
<i>And I began to tremble</i>

37:15.083 --> 37:18.333
<i>You'll go by unseen</i>

37:19.167 --> 37:21.542
<i>And I'll find you</i>

37:24.125 --> 37:27.917
<i>Escorted by your guardians</i>

37:28.125 --> 37:30.708

37:32.458 --> 37:36.083

37:37.042 --> 37:39.625

37:42.042 --> 37:45.500
<i>I felt the wind</i>

37:45.917 --> 37:48.083

37:50.000 --> 37:53.750
<i>I saw the wolves</i>

37:54.458 --> 37:56.500
<i>Go by</i>

37:59.792 --> 38:01.708
<i>In the darkness</i>

38:04.042 --> 38:06.792
<i>You drink from the spring</i>

38:09.167 --> 38:14.292
<i>Like a cursed animal</i>

38:18.167 --> 38:20.583
<i>Like an animal</i>

38:22.625 --> 38:25.542
<i>Like an animal</i>

38:27.208 --> 38:29.500
<i>Like an animal</i>

38:31.625 --> 38:34.333
<i>Like an animal</i>

38:36.167 --> 38:39.083
<i>Like an animal</i>

38:40.583 --> 38:43.625
<i>Like an animal</i>

38:45.042 --> 38:48.333
<i>Like an animal</i>

40:47.417 --> 40:48.417
Hello?

40:54.958 --> 40:56.292
Sorry to bother you.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.792
I was walking down the beach
and I saw you in the distance.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.417
Don't you work at the karaoke bar?

41:05.167 --> 41:07.542
I wanted to tell you
that I loved your performance.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.833
I'd never seen anyone do
one of Lila's songs so well.

41:13.833 --> 41:14.875
Thank you.

41:15.792 --> 41:17.000
My name's Blanca.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.500
Violeta.

41:43.375 --> 41:44.375
Are you...?

41:46.167 --> 41:48.958
- Are you Blanca Guerrero?
- Do you know who I am?

41:49.833 --> 41:50.458
Of course.

41:50.792 --> 41:51.958
Wow.

41:52.708 --> 41:55.542
When you're with Lila,
not many people notice you.

41:55.917 --> 41:56.958
I'm Lila.

41:57.542 --> 41:59.833
I mean, I'm a huge fan of Lila.

42:00.208 --> 42:01.875
I really am. I always have been.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.083
I believe you.

42:04.125 --> 42:06.375
Do you know anywhere open around here?

42:06.958 --> 42:09.583
I feel like a drink before I go home.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.083
These last few weeks
I haven't had much time to relax.

42:14.042 --> 42:15.042
Well...

42:16.417 --> 42:17.417
sure.

42:17.875 --> 42:18.875
I'll explain.

42:19.417 --> 42:21.000
There's a hotel on this beach.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.583
The cafeteria is always open.

42:24.250 --> 42:27.083
- You have to go all the way...
- No.

42:27.708 --> 42:28.458
No.

42:28.625 --> 42:31.708
I'm asking
if you want to have a drink with me.

42:36.583 --> 42:38.458
I haven't come to Rota in years.

42:39.500 --> 42:43.083
My mother was from Jerez de la Frontera
and my father from Sabadell.

42:43.292 --> 42:47.250
We lived in Barcelona, but we came down
to visit my grandparents every summer.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.958
I had an American boyfriend here.
Well, boyfriend...

42:51.708 --> 42:54.333
Friend. He brought me tons of records.

42:54.958 --> 42:57.083
Things that were impossible to get here.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.333
His name was...

43:00.042 --> 43:01.042
James.

43:02.875 --> 43:06.292
One of Lila's makeup artists lives here,
and I needed to see him.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.958
Final arrangements for the concert.

43:09.333 --> 43:10.458
You have a ticket, right?

43:10.625 --> 43:12.958
I bought it
as soon as they went on sale.

43:13.250 --> 43:16.375
Do you want me to send you one,
is there anyone you want to invite?

43:16.875 --> 43:18.833
No, thank you.

43:19.167 --> 43:21.042
- Do you live in Rota?
- Yes.

43:21.750 --> 43:23.375
But you don't look Andalusian.

43:24.167 --> 43:25.417
No, I'm from Madrid.

43:25.792 --> 43:27.917
I moved to Rota ten years ago.

43:28.042 --> 43:29.250
With my daughter.

43:29.583 --> 43:30.875
How old is she?

43:31.125 --> 43:33.875
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-three?

43:34.583 --> 43:38.042
- You were young when you had her.
- Yes, I was.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.542
I don't have children.

43:41.250 --> 43:43.083
I've never had a maternal instinct.

43:43.292 --> 43:46.750
Or if I did, it all went to Lila.

43:52.917 --> 43:54.917
You've never thought of being a singer?

43:58.417 --> 44:00.625
I'm happy just singing Lila's songs.

44:02.375 --> 44:03.958
I don't need anything else.

44:06.833 --> 44:09.292
I was thrilled
when I heard she was performing again.

44:11.875 --> 44:13.667
I was at the hospital when she got out.

44:14.167 --> 44:15.250
Thank you.

44:15.542 --> 44:17.833
It was nothing, just low blood pressure.

44:17.958 --> 44:19.375
Yeah, I read that.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.167
But I have to confess:

44:23.042 --> 44:25.125
when I saw her passed out in the bathtub,

44:25.750 --> 44:27.292
it gave me a good scare.

44:39.750 --> 44:40.875
In the bathtub?

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
I thought she fainted on the beach.

44:43.708 --> 44:45.583
That's what we told the press.

44:46.875 --> 44:49.583
They misinterpret anything
having to do with bathtubs.

44:57.792 --> 44:58.792
Oh, no...

45:00.417 --> 45:01.750
Is something wrong?

45:02.083 --> 45:03.958
No, but I have to go.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.875
Sometimes I feel like a babysitter.

45:08.708 --> 45:11.250
No, you don't have to.
You have a whole glass of whiskey.

45:12.083 --> 45:13.958
It was a pleasure to meet you, Violeta.

45:14.125 --> 45:15.250
Likewise.

45:15.833 --> 45:17.208
Maybe I'll see you again.

45:19.375 --> 45:20.375
Blanca...

45:22.458 --> 45:23.542
Is she OK?

45:25.167 --> 45:26.292
Better than ever.

45:55.250 --> 45:56.250
Hi.

45:57.500 --> 45:58.500
Hi.

45:58.875 --> 45:59.917
Mind if I sit?

46:01.375 --> 46:02.375
I guess.

46:02.875 --> 46:03.917
I'm Álvaro.

46:04.625 --> 46:06.000
I'm a journalist.

46:07.083 --> 46:10.125
I saw you with Blanca Guerrero,
and I thought...

46:10.292 --> 46:12.833
Is it her, or not? It's her!

46:13.292 --> 46:14.458
Because it's been impossible.

46:14.750 --> 46:17.958
Impossible to get a hold of her,
with what happened, all the mystery.

46:19.083 --> 46:20.083
Right.

46:20.333 --> 46:24.833
So I thought,
"Álvaro, it won't hurt to walk over to..."

46:25.208 --> 46:27.875
- What's your name?
- Violeta.

46:28.875 --> 46:30.875
It won't hurt to walk over to Violeta,

46:31.708 --> 46:33.250
and talk to her.

46:33.583 --> 46:36.875
I don't deny I'm a journalist.
I told you that up front.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.833
But I'm also a fan of Lila,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.083
and maybe you know how she's doing.
If she's OK, if she's not OK.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.583
Are you and Blanca friends?

46:46.542 --> 46:47.542
No.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.083
What were you doing with her?

46:50.542 --> 46:52.222
I don't think that's any of your business.

46:53.875 --> 46:57.417
Well... OK, let's see.

46:58.167 --> 47:00.875
This is my number, OK?

47:01.333 --> 47:04.792
If you want to tell me something
about Lila that could interest me,

47:05.875 --> 47:07.542
you can just...

47:08.417 --> 47:09.875
call this number.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.208
Not interested, I'm sorry.

47:16.708 --> 47:17.708
Really?

47:18.542 --> 47:21.125
The magazine is very generous
with its collaborators.

47:22.125 --> 47:23.250
I said no.

47:25.583 --> 47:27.583
Well, at least I tried.

47:35.458 --> 47:36.583
Goodbye.

48:01.458 --> 48:02.583
She said no.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.792
I told you that maybe I'd see you again.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.542
I wasn't entirely honest with you.

48:43.167 --> 48:45.750
Álvaro, the guy
who went up to talk to you,

48:46.958 --> 48:50.375
isn't a journalist.
He's one of my assistants.

48:53.917 --> 48:57.083
Lila didn't faint in the tub,
she passed out on the beach.

48:58.625 --> 49:01.417
I needed to know
how much I could trust you.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.625
I also wasn't honest
when you asked if Lila was OK.

49:09.875 --> 49:12.292
What I'm about to tell you, only Lila,

49:12.375 --> 49:13.583
our lawyer, and I know.

49:13.958 --> 49:15.333
I hope it stays that way.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.042
Lila has amnesia.

49:27.750 --> 49:29.958
It's been hard for me
to be honest with myself.

49:31.792 --> 49:34.125
To me, Lila will always be a star.

49:35.208 --> 49:37.125
But I have to face reality.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.958
And the reality is,
this is her last chance.

49:42.042 --> 49:46.375
If we cancel her concerts,
her career's over. It's that simple.

49:53.917 --> 49:55.917
Why are you telling me all this?

49:59.125 --> 50:01.167
Because I want you to help Lila.

50:01.750 --> 50:03.917
If Lila can't remember that she's Lila,

50:05.083 --> 50:07.125
we need her to learn how to be her.

50:08.625 --> 50:10.833
And she wants you
to be the one to teach her.

50:56.875 --> 50:57.917
Thank you.

51:20.167 --> 51:21.167
Violeta,

51:23.875 --> 51:25.125
this is Lila.

51:38.333 --> 51:39.333
Hi.

51:52.750 --> 51:54.708
Blanca told me you have a daughter.

51:58.333 --> 51:59.375
Yes.

52:00.792 --> 52:01.917
What's her name?

52:04.208 --> 52:05.208
Marta.

52:11.958 --> 52:15.000
The day she was born
was the first time I heard you sing.

52:15.875 --> 52:17.000
Really?

52:19.375 --> 52:21.125
It was the happiest day of my life.

52:22.125 --> 52:23.125
Of course.

52:23.375 --> 52:25.500
Having a child must be beautiful.

52:31.375 --> 52:33.000
I've brought Violeta up to date,

52:33.375 --> 52:35.625
and she understands
that we need to be discreet.

52:36.542 --> 52:37.958
No one can know about this.

52:38.250 --> 52:40.792
Not your friends,
not even your daughter.

52:42.708 --> 52:44.250
Thank you for your help, Violeta.

52:45.167 --> 52:46.292
You're welcome.

52:46.875 --> 52:49.458
The media can't connect you to Lila,

52:49.958 --> 52:51.208
so we'll do it like today.

52:51.500 --> 52:54.208
You'll meet Olga, our lawyer,
in the Caribe Hotel parking lot,

52:54.375 --> 52:55.917
and she'll bring you here.

52:56.583 --> 52:59.375
We know you've never had
voice or dance lessons.

52:59.958 --> 53:03.375
So, please know that both Lila and I

53:03.542 --> 53:05.917
will help you with anything you need.

53:06.583 --> 53:07.833
Thank you.

53:08.042 --> 53:09.250
Is everything clear?

53:09.500 --> 53:10.542
Yes.

53:12.958 --> 53:13.958
Lila?

53:14.792 --> 53:15.792
Lila?

53:18.042 --> 53:19.042
Everything clear?

53:20.125 --> 53:21.208
Crystal.

53:41.458 --> 53:43.208
Could you stop for a moment, please?

54:45.958 --> 54:48.417
<i>Small blue flowers</i>

54:49.833 --> 54:52.167
<i>Burn on my feet</i>

54:53.333 --> 54:55.792
<i>Let's go outside soon</i>

54:58.375 --> 54:59.375
Sorry.

55:01.958 --> 55:02.958
Are you OK?

55:04.250 --> 55:06.125
Yeah, it's just that...

55:07.292 --> 55:09.958
I'm not doing it right. I'm really sorry.

55:10.125 --> 55:12.042
Do you want us to take a break?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.250
No, we haven't even gotten started yet.

55:21.417 --> 55:23.042
It's just a little difficult

55:23.542 --> 55:24.750
with you in front of me.

55:25.083 --> 55:26.443
You think it's going to bother me?

55:26.542 --> 55:28.250
No, it's not that, really.

55:28.625 --> 55:30.250
It's just that...

55:33.583 --> 55:35.375
I'm embarrassed. It's silly.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.083
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

55:37.333 --> 55:38.708
Yeah, sorry.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.458
Can I ask you a question?

55:49.458 --> 55:50.458
Sure.

55:51.083 --> 55:53.083
Did you ever imagine this moment?

55:53.708 --> 55:55.375
The moment we met.

55:56.042 --> 55:57.333
Once or twice.

56:00.917 --> 56:01.917
Tons of times.

56:03.625 --> 56:05.208
But we already met once.

56:05.375 --> 56:08.083
- Really?
- Yes. But I doubt you remember.

56:09.917 --> 56:11.958
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

56:12.958 --> 56:13.958
Was I nice?

56:15.542 --> 56:19.333
Yes. But we didn't have much time,
you signed a record for me.

56:20.208 --> 56:21.917
Was it how you had imagined it?

56:24.125 --> 56:25.500
Not exactly.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.333
How had you imagined it?

56:30.875 --> 56:31.875
Come on.

56:33.333 --> 56:34.333
No.

56:35.625 --> 56:36.875
It's too embarrassing.

56:37.042 --> 56:39.833
OK, I'll tell you something
about myself if you want.

56:39.958 --> 56:41.250
And then you tell me.

56:41.417 --> 56:43.083
Ask me anything you want.

56:49.542 --> 56:51.292
You don't eat live animals, do you?

56:51.375 --> 56:52.375
What?

56:52.500 --> 56:56.417
Sorry. It's an urban myth.
I never believed it.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.958
An urban myth?

56:58.000 --> 56:59.917
Yeah, but don't worry.
Not many people know it.

57:07.542 --> 57:08.875
Aren't you afraid?

57:11.458 --> 57:12.542
Of pretending

57:13.792 --> 57:15.958
to be someone you're not.

57:18.083 --> 57:19.083
Yes.

57:19.833 --> 57:20.875
I'm afraid.

57:22.625 --> 57:23.917
But not of that.

57:25.333 --> 57:26.792
Of what, then?

57:29.333 --> 57:30.542
I still don't know.

57:32.625 --> 57:34.167
And that's better, for the time being.

57:38.083 --> 57:39.083
Your turn.

57:39.833 --> 57:40.917
God!

57:44.792 --> 57:45.792
OK.

57:45.958 --> 57:47.458
I'll tell you.

57:49.375 --> 57:54.167
I'm working late in the karaoke bar,
and your car gets a flat nearby.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.583
Your driver is waiting
for the tow truck,

57:57.875 --> 58:00.708
and you come inside the bar
because you need to go to the bathroom,

58:00.875 --> 58:02.833
and it's the only place open.

58:03.917 --> 58:05.292
You come through the door,

58:05.458 --> 58:07.875
and I get super nervous.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.792
But I hide it the best I can.

58:10.583 --> 58:11.917
I go up to you,

58:12.167 --> 58:14.167
and congratulate you for your work.

58:14.625 --> 58:16.750
But I'm calm. Like we're equals.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.542
And how would you do that?

58:19.250 --> 58:21.125
Well, I'd tell you:

58:21.333 --> 58:23.292
"I love 'The Inverted Flight'."

58:23.458 --> 58:25.000
What's "The Inverted Flight?"

58:25.417 --> 58:28.333
It's one of your songs,
but not many people know it.

58:28.750 --> 58:30.083
Not even I do.

58:30.792 --> 58:31.792
Then,

58:31.833 --> 58:33.500
you give me your number.

58:33.708 --> 58:36.708
You ask me to call you
so we can get a drink one day.

58:37.750 --> 58:40.230
Did I invite you to my house,
or did we meet up somewhere else?

58:42.375 --> 58:43.583
At your house.

58:45.417 --> 58:46.875
Well, now you're at my house.

58:48.333 --> 58:49.750
Shall we continue?

59:04.542 --> 59:06.125
- Hi.
- Hi.

59:06.708 --> 59:08.833
- You staying for lunch?
- Yeah.

59:15.958 --> 59:17.000
Mom...

59:17.792 --> 59:18.792
Yes?

59:21.167 --> 59:22.333
I...

59:24.125 --> 59:25.208
I'm sorry.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
It's fine.

59:30.750 --> 59:31.958
Did you buy the phone?

59:33.250 --> 59:36.083
- Does it take good pictures?
- Yes.

59:36.583 --> 59:37.708
I'm glad.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.625
I'd like to pay you back

59:50.625 --> 59:51.708
bit by bit.

59:55.583 --> 59:56.958
You don't need to.

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:06.667
Come on, bring glasses and silverware.

01:00:18.375 --> 01:00:19.958
What's your favorite color?

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:22.125
Pink.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.083
Your favorite food?

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:26.083
Avocado tartar and nuts.

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.375
A perfect vacation?

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:29.958
In Iceland.

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:32.458
- A book.
- "A Mortal Spring."

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.333
- Record?
- "Thriller."

01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:37.167
A movie.

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.083
"The Naked Island."

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.250
- What do you hate most in people?
- Being fake.

01:00:43.167 --> 01:00:45.625
- What you most like in people?
- When...

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:52.208
LILA CASEN IS UNIQUE

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:55.958
I can't remember.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:57.333
Manners.

01:00:59.833 --> 01:01:00.958
That's right.

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:03.375
Isn't that a bit contradictory?

01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:04.583
What?

01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:09.208
That you hate fake people the most,
but then you like manners the most.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.000
Having manners means
being a little fake, doesn't it?

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:14.625
I guess you're right.

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:20.792
Why are you learning the answers?
Why don't you say how you feel now?

01:01:21.917 --> 01:01:23.625
Are you afraid the answers won't match?

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:26.000
No, it's not that.

01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:28.958
- Well, then?
- Well...

01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.542
I just don't know the answers.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Let me see.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.917
What's your favorite color?

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.167
Navy blue.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:54.208
- Your favorite food?
- Fried eggs.

01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:56.917
A perfect vacation?

01:01:58.375 --> 01:01:59.375
In Rome.

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:03.833
When did you start singing?

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:07.833
That question isn't on the test.

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:10.458
I know. But I'm asking you.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:14.958
I think...

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:18.375
At my friend Susana's house.

01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:22.208
We wore her mom's clothes
and pretended we were the Goggi Sisters.

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.250
We had a blast.

01:02:24.917 --> 01:02:27.792
We did concerts at her house
and we invited the whole class.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:29.417
We charged entry, too.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.250
Candy, comics...

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.500
Her mom was nice,
she went along with it.

01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:39.083
But her house always smelled weird.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.375
Like a cat.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.250
What's your favorite color?

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:57.917
Navy blue.

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:07.833
I'll finish this and make dinner.

01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:11.125
I want to wrap up the last week
before the concert.

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:16.833
We'll have to go to Madrid
to see the stylist and the photographer.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.958
We'll have to talk about
how to do interviews.

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:23.750
Who did I imitate when I was little?

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.042
What?

01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:31.625
When we met, what songs did I sing?

01:03:32.292 --> 01:03:33.917
They were your songs.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.792
You wrote them,
you composed them, you sang them.

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:41.500
That's why you were so special.

01:03:42.042 --> 01:03:44.000
Because you didn't copy anyone.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.292
Don't think about who you imitated
when you were a girl.

01:03:54.292 --> 01:03:56.458
Think about the girls who imitate you.

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:48.750
<i>Because now there's no cold or pain</i>

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:55.167
<i>Because now there's no cold or pain</i>

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.333
<i>Because</i>

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:01.500
<i>Now</i>

01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:04.500
<i>There's no cold</i>

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:07.583
<i>Or pain</i>

01:05:09.292 --> 01:05:11.417
<i>Or pain</i>

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.625
That was good.

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:35.958
No, I'm starting over.
That was shit, OK?

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:46.333
You've done it six times in a row.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.042
- Maybe you should take a break.
- Don't stop the music.

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.292
Violeta, it's not good.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.083
It's not good, can't you see that?

01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:56.125
Look at my steps.

01:05:57.417 --> 01:05:58.417
Look.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:04.167
Look at me. What is this?

01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:06.417
What is this?

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:09.750
I look fucking lame.

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:15.208
What are we even doing here?

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:17.042
Tell me.

01:06:17.792 --> 01:06:19.292
What are the two of us doing here?

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:22.208
We're trying...

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:23.875
It's impossible.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:26.333
Impossible for me
to be that woman again.

01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:28.208
I know you can do it.

01:06:28.292 --> 01:06:30.792
You just have to try, relax and enjoy.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:34.958
You know I can do it.

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:38.125
Great, I'm so relieved,
having your approval.

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:41.958
You sing on a karaoke stage
and now you think you're an expert.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:44.000
Sweetie, you haven't got a clue.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.958
I'm sorry, Violeta.

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:09.042
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:07:37.583 --> 01:07:40.083
You do look pretty lame.

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:54.958
<i>Yesterday I was going to say goodbye</i>

01:07:55.792 --> 01:07:58.792
<i>And I didn't have the courage</i>

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:04.958
<i>There was so much love in your eyes</i>

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:12.083
<i>It's so easy to say goodbye</i>

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:16.457
<i>So easy to forget</i>

01:08:17.417 --> 01:08:22.250
<i>It will be so hard for us both</i>

01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:27.332
<i>Who will sing to you</i>

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.250
<i>With this guitar?</i>

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.957
<i>Who will play it</i>

01:08:35.082 --> 01:08:38.207
<i>When I'm gone?</i>

01:08:38.832 --> 01:08:42.875
<i>Who will give your house color</i>

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.207
<i>And warm your bed?</i>

01:08:46.457 --> 01:08:49.957
<i>Who will make love to you?</i>

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:53.167
<i>Who will sing to you</i>

01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:56.832
<i>With this guitar?</i>

01:08:57.832 --> 01:09:00.332
<i>Who will play it</i>

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:04.750
<i>When I'm gone?</i>

01:09:05.167 --> 01:09:09.082
<i>Who will give your house color</i>

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:12.625
<i>And warm your bed?</i>

01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:16.207
<i>Who will make love to you?</i>

01:09:44.457 --> 01:09:46.417
You know why you're my best friend?

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.582
Why?

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:51.292
Because you're the best person I know.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:55.208
You're a good person, too, Marta.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.333
- No.
- Yes.

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:00.333
You are.

01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.333
- Slap me.
- What are you talking about?

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.143
- Slap me. Like this.
- What are you doing?

01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:10.000
- It's not hard. Slap me.
- Stop it.

01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:41.042
What's up?

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:43.042
How are you?

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:52.875
I was looking for you,
I wanted to tell you something.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:54.542
What?

01:10:57.167 --> 01:10:59.542
Last week,
when you called your boyfriend,

01:11:00.042 --> 01:11:02.250
and he said
he was with Omar and the guys...

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:04.875
It wasn't true.

01:11:07.333 --> 01:11:08.792
What are you talking about?

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:10.500
What?

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:15.917
I was sucking him off in the bathroom.

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.042
I feel so much better now!

01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:24.333
Man, I needed to tell you.

01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:28.042
What the fuck is your problem?

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.292
What? You want more?

01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:34.375
Sure.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.208
Fuck!

01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:51.417
Hit me!

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:55.292
Fuck!

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:04.833
Marta!

01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:40.833
<i>Where is our mistake
with no solution?</i>

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:44.792
<i>Were you the guilty one,
or was it me?</i>

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:49.083
<i>Not you, not anyone
can ever make me change</i>

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:53.000
<i>A thousand bells toll in my heart</i>

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:56.583
<i>It's so hard to ask for forgiveness</i>

01:12:57.125 --> 01:13:01.833
<i>Not you, not anyone
can ever make me change</i>

01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:08.958
- Can I help you?
- What?

01:13:09.208 --> 01:13:10.208
What do you need?

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.292
- Is Violeta here?
- No.

01:13:13.292 --> 01:13:14.708
She isn't working today?

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:18.083
She's normally here Mondays,
but she had to quit work a few days.

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:21.583
Why?

01:13:22.958 --> 01:13:24.167
Are you her friend?

01:13:25.208 --> 01:13:27.958
Her mother, she's sick
and she has to take care of her.

01:13:31.958 --> 01:13:34.375
Do you want to leave
a message for her with me?

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:38.750
Are you OK?

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.792
Do you want a drink?

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:47.000
<i>Where is our mistake
with no solution?</i>

01:13:47.167 --> 01:13:50.667
<i>Were you the guilty one,
or was it me?</i>

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:55.292
<i>Not you, not anyone
can ever make me change</i>

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:09.542
Good morning.

01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:12.625
Good morning.

01:14:13.292 --> 01:14:14.542
Did you go out last night?

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:16.375
Yeah.

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:21.625
I'm exhausted.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.750
I'm making chocolate milk
and going to bed.

01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:31.042
Lots of work?

01:14:32.417 --> 01:14:33.417
Sorry?

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:36.083
I asked if there was lots of work
at the karaoke bar.

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:37.875
Yeah.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.625
Do you have Lady Gaga songs?

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:43.917
Yes.

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:48.583
I'd love to go to the karaoke bar one day
and sing Lady Gaga. The one that says...

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.583
Yeah, we've got that one.

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:11.042
Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow.

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:14.083
Better next week.

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:17.125
This week we've got
tons of bachelor parties,

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:19.167
it's impossible to sing.

01:15:20.417 --> 01:15:21.917
Next week, then.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:23.750
That would be better.

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:28.958
<i>Like an animal</i>

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.458
<i>Like an animal</i>

01:16:35.792 --> 01:16:38.167
<i>Like an animal</i>

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:42.917
<i>Like an animal</i>

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:47.125
<i>Like an animal</i>

01:16:49.292 --> 01:16:51.417
<i>Like an animal</i>

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:15.208
- How was that?
- Perfect.

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:20.333
I want you to come on tour with me.

01:17:21.458 --> 01:17:24.042
It'd be good to have you there,
in case I need help.

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.958
I'll tell Blanca tonight.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.167
Well...

01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:30.958
Well? What, you don't want to?

01:17:31.542 --> 01:17:34.958
Blanca thinks it's best
if we stop seeing each other after this.

01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:36.750
I think so, too.

01:17:37.125 --> 01:17:38.125
Why?

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:42.208
I'd have to lie to my daughter,
and I don't want to do that anymore.

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:46.458
But I have front row tickets
for the Madrid concert.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.625
And I want Marta to come with me.

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:52.625
Let's let some time pass.

01:17:54.125 --> 01:17:55.125
OK.

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:59.250
But when the tour is over,
I'll be going to watch you perform.

01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:00.458
Me?

01:18:02.417 --> 01:18:04.875
Are you going to stop
singing my songs at the karaoke bar?

01:18:05.333 --> 01:18:06.333
No.

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:10.375
Then one day I'll show up
and surprise you, like in your fantasy.

01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:14.792
But if you're going
to imitate Lila Cassen,

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:16.625
imitate her for real.

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:28.417
Pick the one you like best.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.083
No, no, no.

01:18:34.417 --> 01:18:35.417
Please.

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:47.208
Thank you.

01:18:47.917 --> 01:18:48.917
No, Violeta.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:50.583
Thank you.

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.292
Do you want to try it on?

01:20:21.833 --> 01:20:23.167
Let's go to the beach.

01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:45.042
Lila!

01:20:58.792 --> 01:21:01.500
Violeta, Olga is here!

01:21:04.167 --> 01:21:05.417
Lila!

01:22:15.917 --> 01:22:16.917
Hi.

01:22:18.417 --> 01:22:19.417
Hi.

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.958
Thanks for fixing the glass.

01:22:24.167 --> 01:22:25.167
You're welcome.

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:43.542
Hey.

01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:48.958
Do you want to go
to the Lila Cassen concert?

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.042
The Lila Cassen concert?

01:22:51.292 --> 01:22:53.583
Yeah, the first one in her tour,
in Madrid.

01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:57.417
I thought we could spend
the weekend there.

01:22:57.917 --> 01:23:00.750
We could go to the Prado Museum,
or the Retiro.

01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:03.417
We haven't been back since we left.

01:23:03.875 --> 01:23:05.750
I went with Diana last year.

01:23:06.292 --> 01:23:07.292
Right.

01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:10.375
I meant together,
we haven't been together.

01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:13.208
Besides, I've already been to the Prado
and I didn't like it.

01:23:13.542 --> 01:23:15.542
I saw a painting of a guy eating his son.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
How gross!

01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:21.042
We could see "The Lion King".

01:23:22.917 --> 01:23:24.542
I have a better idea.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.667
Sure, what?

01:23:28.542 --> 01:23:32.583
If we want to see Lila Cassen,
we could just go straight to her house.

01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:36.625
Why do you say that?

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.917
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:44.167
You don't know what to say, do you?

01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:47.833
Because I guess the truth
would be too hard for you to tell me.

01:23:53.417 --> 01:23:54.250
How do you know...?

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:55.333
I followed you.

01:24:00.417 --> 01:24:01.875
Why don't you trust me?

01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:04.958
Marta, I...

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.292
Before you continue,

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:09.583
I only ask that you tell me the truth.

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:11.917
Please.

01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:18.875
Lila's agent came to see me a few days ago
at the karaoke bar.

01:24:25.417 --> 01:24:28.583
Lila had seen me singing
in one of my videos, and she wanted...

01:24:32.208 --> 01:24:33.250
What did she want?

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:41.625
She wanted me to help her.

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:44.208
For you to help her?

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:46.875
You? With what?

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:56.083
She wanted me to help her sing again.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.583
Why, did she lose her memory
or something?

01:25:08.167 --> 01:25:11.333
I warned you.
I warned you not to lie to me.

01:25:11.417 --> 01:25:12.917
I'm not lying.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I swear.

01:25:17.958 --> 01:25:19.542
I swear on my life.

01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:27.458
She couldn't remember anything
after she fainted on the beach.

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:30.167
She didn't remember who she was.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:32.250
Or her songs.

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:34.583
Nothing.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:39.375
I helped her sing again.

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:53.250
Wait, because...

01:25:53.875 --> 01:25:55.833
I don't know
if I'm understanding this right.

01:25:57.792 --> 01:26:00.958
You're telling me that
you taught Lila Cassen her songs?

01:26:01.583 --> 01:26:02.708
Yes.

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:04.958
You,

01:26:05.333 --> 01:26:06.417
my mother?

01:26:07.708 --> 01:26:11.042
My mother taught Lila Cassen
Lila Cassen's songs.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:12.875
That's right.

01:26:18.542 --> 01:26:19.833
Oh, my God.

01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:32.792
But that...

01:26:33.875 --> 01:26:35.208
That's a big deal.

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:40.125
That's a really big deal, Mom.

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.333
We're going to hit the jackpot!

01:27:06.792 --> 01:27:07.792
What?

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:09.958
Of course, Mom. Think about it.

01:27:11.208 --> 01:27:12.500
What do you mean?

01:27:12.583 --> 01:27:16.042
We can go on all the talk shows
and tell the whole story.

01:27:16.583 --> 01:27:19.292
Can you describe the house?
That's really important.

01:27:20.292 --> 01:27:23.125
Besides, it's great for her,
with all the promotion for the concert.

01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:25.667
Everyone will be talking about her,
about your story.

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.917
Did you hook up with her?

01:27:30.125 --> 01:27:35.042
Well, we can insinuate.
We don't have to say yes or no.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.292
I'll handle everything.

01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:26.292
Where's the Hello Kitty hairband?

01:28:29.125 --> 01:28:30.625
Is it here?

01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:33.417
It's not?

01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:37.917
Here.

01:30:41.458 --> 01:30:42.958
Have you seen my cell phone?

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:48.042
Have you seen my cell phone?

01:30:49.833 --> 01:30:51.042
Fucking great!

01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:55.708
I'm talking to you!

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.458
Would you mind answering me?

01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:00.458
Look at me when I talk to you!

01:31:01.958 --> 01:31:05.917
What's wrong?
Now you're angry? You're acting superior?

01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:09.333
Don't you realize I'm doing it for us?

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.750
No, I get this shit. You took it.

01:31:16.333 --> 01:31:18.333
You think she's your friend, is that it?

01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:26.833
I can't believe you're that stupid.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:29.875
Don't you get it?

01:31:30.708 --> 01:31:33.042
Don't you get it? She's using you.

01:31:42.875 --> 01:31:45.167
Keep my fucking cell phone
and your friend!

01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:48.542
She doesn't give a shit about you
and I don't either!

01:31:58.583 --> 01:32:00.000
Look...

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.125
No way.

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:10.875
My keys!

01:32:13.125 --> 01:32:14.250
My keys!

01:32:15.458 --> 01:32:17.417
My keys or I'll trash the house!

01:32:18.292 --> 01:32:20.583
I swear to God, I'll trash the house!

01:32:43.167 --> 01:32:44.458
You asked for it!

01:33:04.917 --> 01:33:05.917
My keys.

01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:13.333
My keys, or I slit my throat.
I swear to God, I'll do it.

01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:17.167
I swear I will.

01:33:21.042 --> 01:33:23.125
Mom, I'll do it.

01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:28.042
I swear by all you hold dear,
I am not joking around.

01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:32.333
Mom!

01:33:34.583 --> 01:33:36.208
Mom, I'll do it!

01:33:39.167 --> 01:33:40.292
Mom!

01:33:42.875 --> 01:33:43.958
Mom!

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:45.958
I'll do it!

01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:53.042
Mom!

01:33:55.167 --> 01:33:57.208
Mom, I'll do it!

01:33:59.292 --> 01:34:00.542
Mom...

01:34:04.625 --> 01:34:05.708
Mom...

01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:12.833
I'll do it.

01:34:19.708 --> 01:34:20.875
I'm...

01:34:22.417 --> 01:34:23.583
going...

01:34:25.917 --> 01:34:27.000
to...

01:34:30.125 --> 01:34:31.500
do it.

01:34:41.708 --> 01:34:42.917
Do it.

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.167
Lila?

01:35:32.042 --> 01:35:34.208
Violeta's here.
We'll wait for you downstairs.

01:35:36.292 --> 01:35:37.500
Don't take too long.

01:35:38.292 --> 01:35:39.833
Today is the last day.

01:36:16.917 --> 01:36:18.250
Lila, are you OK?

01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:20.083
What happened?

01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:22.625
Lila...

01:36:28.958 --> 01:36:31.750
Blanca,
I'm not going to be Lila again.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.083
Violeta, give us a moment, please.

01:36:46.292 --> 01:36:47.417
Sweetheart,

01:36:47.917 --> 01:36:49.417
I know you're nervous.

01:36:49.958 --> 01:36:51.708
I know you haven't sung in many years.

01:36:52.375 --> 01:36:53.917
But it's going to be OK.

01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:56.208
You don't need to worry.

01:36:56.792 --> 01:36:58.208
I'll be with you.

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.292
I've always been with you.

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:02.083
I know.

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.875
And I'm sorry.

01:37:05.708 --> 01:37:06.833
Sorry for what?

01:37:07.958 --> 01:37:10.958
I'm sorry I can't give you back
the ten years you spent at my side.

01:37:11.833 --> 01:37:13.958
But I can stop you
from wasting another ten

01:37:14.083 --> 01:37:16.083
waiting for something
that will never happen.

01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:25.958
Waiting for what, Lila?

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:30.292
I've been with you all this time for you.

01:37:30.542 --> 01:37:32.167
Because I want to help you.

01:37:35.042 --> 01:37:37.500
I understood
the first year after your mother died.

01:37:38.833 --> 01:37:42.000
I got worried the second.
The third, the fourth, the fifth...

01:37:42.167 --> 01:37:44.542
Ten years wondering what had happened.

01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:47.250
What I'd done so wrong

01:37:47.417 --> 01:37:49.977
that you couldn't even tell me
why you didn't want to sing again.

01:37:50.792 --> 01:37:54.125
All that time with you
and I never asked for any explanation.

01:37:55.292 --> 01:37:57.792
So please don't tell me
I was expecting something

01:37:57.875 --> 01:38:00.625
when all I've done this whole time

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:03.792
is try to protect you from something
that I don't even know what it is,

01:38:03.875 --> 01:38:05.417
because you've never told me.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.708
I'm sorry.

01:38:08.125 --> 01:38:12.000
Stop saying that. I don't want you
to be sorry. I want you to be Lila again!

01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:13.292
But I can't.

01:38:16.292 --> 01:38:17.292
Why not?

01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:29.083
If I leave,

01:38:31.792 --> 01:38:33.583
you'll never see me again.

01:38:36.083 --> 01:38:37.625
I want you to understand that.

01:38:38.167 --> 01:38:39.417
I understand.

01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:15.917
It may be easy to stop being Lila.

01:39:18.167 --> 01:39:20.500
But I doubt you can live without singing.

01:41:20.542 --> 01:41:22.958
<i>I try to forget you</i>

01:41:25.333 --> 01:41:29.125
<i>Following the path
of a wounded bird</i>

01:41:31.833 --> 01:41:34.208
<i>I try to stay away</i>

01:41:35.917 --> 01:41:40.125
<i>From those places
where we loved each other</i>

01:41:40.958 --> 01:41:42.625
What's that song called?

01:41:45.583 --> 01:41:46.583
It doesn't have a title.

01:41:48.167 --> 01:41:49.542
Did you write it?

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.500
Yes.

01:41:53.417 --> 01:41:54.917
Why doesn't it have a title?

01:41:55.792 --> 01:41:59.333
I had to quit singing when my daughter
was born, to care for her.

01:42:00.333 --> 01:42:01.375
How strange.

01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:11.042
What is?

01:42:22.625 --> 01:42:25.625
I had to start singing
to care for my mother.

01:42:26.958 --> 01:42:28.375
I didn't know that.

01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.042
No one does.

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:32.917
Look behind the picture.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.417
It took me
three years to find them all.

01:43:06.958 --> 01:43:08.250
I destroyed all of them.

01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:09.792
Except that one.

01:43:10.958 --> 01:43:12.042
I couldn't.

01:43:14.125 --> 01:43:15.292
Who is it?

01:43:16.958 --> 01:43:18.125
My mother.

01:43:22.208 --> 01:43:23.958
My mother wanted to be a singer.

01:43:26.042 --> 01:43:27.417
My mother was a singer.

01:43:29.083 --> 01:43:31.792
She liked writing songs,
composing them...

01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:37.750
She saved some money and made a demo.
That's it.

01:43:39.125 --> 01:43:40.625
Lili Cassen.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.917
A small record company
promised her a single.

01:43:46.083 --> 01:43:47.375
But it all stopped there.

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:49.042
She stopped there.

01:43:49.625 --> 01:43:52.208
Like the majority, at a promise.

01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:56.958
My mother, besides a singer,

01:43:57.333 --> 01:43:58.917
was a heroin addict.

01:44:01.125 --> 01:44:02.750
I started imitating my mother.

01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:04.333
In class.

01:44:05.833 --> 01:44:07.625
At parties at the end
of the school year...

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:12.250
It reminded me
that she used to be someone else.

01:44:13.583 --> 01:44:15.292
Someone who didn't disgust me.

01:44:18.375 --> 01:44:21.208
I won my first contest
when I was eighteen.

01:44:21.958 --> 01:44:23.500
Ten thousand pesetas.

01:44:24.125 --> 01:44:27.500
Money to sing, I couldn't believe it.

01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:31.500
I signed up
for every music contest I could,

01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:33.458
and I won almost all of them.

01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:43.333
In one year
I saved enough to put my mother in rehab.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.333
My mother quit heroin.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.375
Then Blanca came along.

01:44:54.792 --> 01:44:57.417
My first record
was number one in Spain.

01:44:59.583 --> 01:45:02.917
It was an exact copy
of my mother's demo.

01:45:03.167 --> 01:45:05.708
The same songs, sung by me.

01:45:07.042 --> 01:45:08.375
My mother was happy,

01:45:08.542 --> 01:45:11.958
because her songs had seen the light,
thanks to her daughter.

01:45:15.458 --> 01:45:18.625
I remember the day I told her
she wouldn't be in the credits.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.542
I convinced her that we were both Lila.

01:45:25.458 --> 01:45:26.750
She didn't say anything.

01:45:27.708 --> 01:45:29.042
She just smiled.

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.542
She knew she owed me that.

01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:36.417
I knew she owed me that.

01:45:37.208 --> 01:45:38.750
It was our secret.

01:45:41.333 --> 01:45:43.000
Blanca never knew anything.

01:45:47.833 --> 01:45:50.500
Years passed,
and we recorded more albums.

01:45:52.292 --> 01:45:55.167
She wrote each and every one
of Lila's songs,

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.583
and was never in the credits.

01:45:59.208 --> 01:46:01.875
I sent her all the money she needed
and that was it.

01:46:06.167 --> 01:46:09.417
When we got started on the fifth album,

01:46:11.375 --> 01:46:13.583
I found out she was shooting up again.

01:46:15.917 --> 01:46:17.458
I wasn't worried about her.

01:46:18.375 --> 01:46:21.083
I didn't even think
of checking her into rehab again.

01:46:23.375 --> 01:46:27.708
All I worried about was going on TV
and saying she was a drug addict,

01:46:27.917 --> 01:46:30.958
that I copied her,
that she wrote my songs.

01:46:33.292 --> 01:46:34.583
I was trapped

01:46:35.792 --> 01:46:37.208
and I hated her for that.

01:46:39.458 --> 01:46:41.125
I ended up hating her so much...

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:48.500
One night,
after releasing the fifth album,

01:46:49.375 --> 01:46:52.208
I went to see her for her birthday.

01:46:55.708 --> 01:46:57.375
You know what I gave her?

01:46:59.583 --> 01:47:02.833
You know what I gave my mother
for her sixtieth birthday?

01:47:09.917 --> 01:47:11.542
Ten grams of heroin.

01:47:19.917 --> 01:47:24.500
The next day, they called me to say
my mother had died of an overdose.

01:47:27.583 --> 01:47:29.833
Lila died the day my mother died.

01:48:38.958 --> 01:48:40.958
I'll see you in the rehearsal room
in a half hour.

01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:43.792
Why?

01:48:48.417 --> 01:48:50.208
We have a day of work left.

01:49:06.917 --> 01:49:07.750
What are you doing?

01:49:07.833 --> 01:49:09.458
We have to finish rehearsing.

01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:12.000
Why are you doing this?

01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:15.500
You hired me to prepare a concert
and that's what I'm doing.

01:49:17.292 --> 01:49:19.208
Violeta, I'll never be Lila again.

01:49:20.958 --> 01:49:21.958
I know.

01:49:31.208 --> 01:49:32.250
Call yourself.

01:49:32.917 --> 01:49:33.917
What?

01:49:34.208 --> 01:49:36.083
Take my phone and call your house.

01:49:36.792 --> 01:49:38.458
You remember the number, right?

01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:42.042
Then call yourself.

01:49:46.208 --> 01:49:47.250
Trust me.

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:34.167
<i>I try to forget you</i>

01:50:35.583 --> 01:50:39.708
<i>Following the path of a wounded bird</i>

01:50:42.167 --> 01:50:44.458
<i>I try to stay away</i>

01:51:16.417 --> 01:51:20.458

<i>I try to forget you</i>

01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:30.708
<i>Counting and stepping on
the fallen leaves.</i>

01:51:33.167 --> 01:51:35.708
<i>I try to tire myself</i>

01:51:37.042 --> 01:51:41.417
<i>Barely alive when night falls</i>

01:51:43.375 --> 01:51:45.458
<i>And when I see our home</i>

01:51:45.917 --> 01:51:52.125
<i>So lonely, silent,
I don't know what I would do</i>

01:51:53.542 --> 01:51:58.792

01:52:03.958 --> 01:52:08.875
<i>What I would do
to not feel this way</i>

01:52:09.083 --> 01:52:14.958
<i>To not live like I'm lost</i>

01:52:37.125 --> 01:52:39.500
<i>I try to forget you</i>
