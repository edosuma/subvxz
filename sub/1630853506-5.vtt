WEBVTT

00:10.480 --> 00:11.960
OK, you can go.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.040
This is the last of it.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.440
Stop!

00:22.440 --> 00:24.400
We'll give you the money back!

00:24.400 --> 00:26.640
Please, we'll pay it back and more!

00:26.640 --> 00:29.680
More! Give us, uh, eight weeks.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.600
That's it.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.400
No. Count it all again.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.040
He's counted it three
times already. That...is...it.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.720
We did it? We're done.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.600
Woo!

00:52.600 --> 00:56.480
♪ This train is a clean train,

Ma'am.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.080
Diane. How did you
get into the police car park?

02:12.080 --> 02:14.240
Oh, I went up to the front desk,
said I had information

02:14.240 --> 02:17.320
on the Somerset Stalker, desk
sergeant went to get his notepad -

02:17.320 --> 02:19.200
bingo. Right.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.960
And can I help you with something?
Yeah.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.600
Cluck-cluck-cluck.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.520
Excuse me? I found this little
bad boy on a routine search

02:30.520 --> 02:33.680
of the community centre, carried out
while I was on a date during which

02:33.680 --> 02:35.800
the guy said he was in love with me.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.400
After one date.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.800
You take evidence bags on dates?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.560
What, you don't?

02:41.560 --> 02:46.200
What do you imagine to be
the significance of a plastic egg?

02:46.200 --> 02:50.120
Oh. Well, ma'am, these can be used
to transport or conceal

02:50.120 --> 02:51.520
illegal drugs

02:51.520 --> 02:55.120
cos they can be inserted
into various human orifices.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.920
Oh. You open the egg thusly,
pop the drugs in, close the lid,

02:58.920 --> 03:00.840
then gently insert it

03:00.840 --> 03:03.880
into your anal or vaginal cavity.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.280
Like that, or there.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.320
Dealer's choice. Well, uh...
Do you want to...?

03:14.440 --> 03:18.360
It's evidence. Thank you, Diane,
I will see to this. Pleasure.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.440
Have a good day.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.480
Jesus Christ.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.240
Can I talk to you about something?

03:42.240 --> 03:44.760
Since they granted us
the community centre,

03:44.760 --> 03:47.200
there are all these due diligence
forms to fill in,

03:47.200 --> 03:49.960
and this one's about
money laundering.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.440
Money laundering? Yes.
Not-for-profits are a big target

03:53.440 --> 03:55.080
for money launderers, obviously,

03:55.080 --> 03:57.720
and we have to be
whiter-than-white.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.480
That's not the phrase I'd use.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.120
So, I was checking
our bank account and...

04:03.120 --> 04:04.720
What am I looking at, exactly?

04:04.720 --> 04:08.120
Here. Thousands of pounds going out

04:08.120 --> 04:11.320
to something called
Laycock Logistical Services.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.200
Do you know what that is?
Hmm.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.240
During my date with Gregory Dillard,
I immediately noticed

04:19.240 --> 04:22.280
he shuffled into the pub with
hunched shoulders and lowered head,

04:22.280 --> 04:24.440
as if he doesn't want to be seen
by the world,

04:24.440 --> 04:27.000
like a paedo in a playground.
I get that.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.880
What do you mean, you get that?!
During our conversation,

04:29.880 --> 04:33.080
the subject told me he was so lonely
he sometimes orders things

04:33.080 --> 04:36.240
from Amazon just so he can
see humans over the weekend.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.840
Actually, here I've got written,

04:39.840 --> 04:42.240
"My vagina feels
as dry as a camel's arse."

04:42.240 --> 04:45.560
This is good. Thank you so much,
Diane. I mean, everything you are

04:45.560 --> 04:48.680
saying completely chimes
with my own findings. Which are?

04:48.680 --> 04:51.880
Since his divorce, Greg has become
so scared of rejection

04:51.880 --> 04:54.680
that to protect himself from it,
he has made himself hideous.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.160
Mm. Yeah, I concur.
I object. Overruled. Mm.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.960
Also I think all this repression is
actually making Greg very dangerous.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.960
During our date on Friday,
he kissed me

05:05.960 --> 05:08.400
without me giving him
any sexual signals.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.200
You asked me to
have intercourse with you!

05:11.200 --> 05:13.480
Yeah. As a test.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.120
Mm.
What kind of test would that be?!

05:16.120 --> 05:18.360
He came at me
with such terrifying lust,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.600
I was forced to pepper spray him.
Seriously?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.280
Why do you think I came home
in tears?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.880
I thought you were like
that after every date.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.040
Look who's here.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.960
Hello, son.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.680
You look well.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.000
So do you.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.320
One month. She's clean.
As a whistle.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.640
Good for you, Mum.
Weird how it happened.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.000
I was buying gear from this kid
and he handed me a leaflet

05:59.000 --> 06:01.520
for one of them drug support groups.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.720
Got to start listening when even
your dealer's worried about you, eh?

06:04.720 --> 06:07.080
So, I want to move
back in with Mum. No.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.280
Why not? She's better now.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.640
Look, I'm proper glad
you're better and that,

06:14.640 --> 06:18.400
but we both know one month's
just not a long time.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.440
One day at a time, son.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.960
I couldn't agree with you more.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.960
Esme, go and get ready
for school, please. I got ages.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.920
Es. Please go and get ready
for school.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.560
Do you know she's got
a boyfriend now? Yeah, of course.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.560
Missy's all grown-up.
Still my little girl, though.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.000
It's good to see you.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.560
Congratulations on the coin.
I hope it all works out.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.280
Goodbye, Mum.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.320
He's not my legal guardian
any more. So, I can move in with you

07:14.320 --> 07:16.440
if I want to. I can do what I want.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.800
Your brother only wants
the best for you.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.320
You feel like a big man now?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.720
What in God's name
are you doing, Frank?

07:45.720 --> 07:47.560
Ironing.

07:47.560 --> 07:51.160
Well, how'd you learn to do that?
Tom showed me a video

07:51.160 --> 07:52.920
on the internet.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.440
I'm going to mow the lawn next.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.000
Who are you and what have you done
with my father?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.680
I'll get it.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.800
It's sort of like making a pizza.
Is it?

08:06.200 --> 08:09.160
How's your mom doing?
Oh, she's much better.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.800
They think that she had an adverse
reaction to some medication.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.960
She's back in the home now.
That's good.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.400
We should visit again.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.440
I'd appreciate that, thank you.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.360
Grandpa, there's someone
at the door for you.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.040
Hey.

08:33.040 --> 08:36.280
What's tickin', chicken?
Don't call me chicken.

08:39.160 --> 08:43.920
There's this woman, Claire, she's
my second-in-command at the BJC.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.680
Now that we've got our little
situation under control,

08:47.680 --> 08:51.520
she's started snooping around
in our finances. Why?

08:51.520 --> 08:53.960
She'll do anything to bring me down.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.160
That is,
unless I can bring her down first.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.320
Is that something
you could help with?

09:00.320 --> 09:04.000
Are you sure you want to start
throwing innocent folks

09:04.000 --> 09:06.920
under the bus?
Claire isn't innocent.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.120
She's trying to take control
of my group.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.760
If I have to choose between Claire
and the BJC, I choose the BJC.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.360
You sound like Stalin
before the purges.

09:16.520 --> 09:21.520
Do you want to join me in jail
if she carries on digging?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.000
You and your second-in-command,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.920
you both have BJC credit cards
for expenses and whatnot?

09:26.920 --> 09:28.400
Yeah.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.680
Good. We'll run the old
Windy City Railroad on her.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.280
I need you to...

09:43.280 --> 09:45.320
..send her on a coffee run.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.160
OK. So, let's imagine this is
a really hip cocktail bar and,

09:54.160 --> 09:56.160
Greg, let me see you walk in.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.400
You're right, he does walk like he's
on the Sex Offenders Register. Yep.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.240
What? You know it's my sight
that's bad, not my hearing?

10:05.240 --> 10:07.080
Let's try again. OK, turn around.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.040
Right, chin up.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.280
Shoulders back. Walk.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.040
You're too stiff, swing your arms.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.920
You look like a chimp.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.640
Put your thumbs in your belt.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.320
OK. Now, lead with your crotch.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.680
Yeah. Too much. Dial it back,
dial it back.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.520
Add a bit of swagger,
yeah, yeah, that's it.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.000
Easy there, cowboy.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.440
I mean, it's...

10:30.440 --> 10:32.920
..it's...it's good enough?

10:32.920 --> 10:36.760
OK, imagine Diane, she's back in the
pub, she's doing a crossword.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.920
Your date never happened, and then
you walk over and chat her up.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.680
Yep. Come on. Lean, Greg, lean,
let me see some lean.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.640
That's it, yes.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.840
Yes, that's it, Greg.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.440
And ask her out.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.120
How? Say something
off the cuff and flirty. Oh.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.320
Apparently, eight across is
"What's your number?"

10:59.320 --> 11:01.840
Oh, really? That's interesting.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.960
Yeah.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.520
Cos six down is "Fuck off, weirdo."

11:05.520 --> 11:07.320
Would that happen?

11:07.320 --> 11:10.040
It just happened, Greg.
Roll with it. Hello?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.680
Hello, is that Lady Gabby?

11:11.680 --> 11:14.040
This is Claire from
the Bristol Justice Collective.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.400
Oh, hi. How can I help?

11:16.400 --> 11:19.960
Have you heard of something called
Laycock Logistical Services?

11:19.960 --> 11:22.880
Er, no. Should I have?

11:22.880 --> 11:26.160
Forgive me being so direct but
can I ask why you chose to donate

11:26.160 --> 11:29.200
£100,000 to the BJC?
I did what now?!

11:29.200 --> 11:32.080
Don't think we're ungrateful. Thanks
to you, we didn't have to rely on

11:32.080 --> 11:34.760
a council grant,
and we love our new office. I...

11:34.760 --> 11:36.960
I didn't donate £100,00.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.120
I realise you've asked to remain
anonymous but I know it was you.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.000
Sorry, I-I...I have absolutely
no idea what you're talking about.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.880
My lawyer, Greg, handles
the money matters.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.880
Why are you asking all of this?

11:48.880 --> 11:52.160
Because I think we could be
the victims of money laundering.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.400
You still there?

11:59.600 --> 12:01.600
Let me look into it.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.000
That wasn't flirting,
you just shot me in the face!

12:20.880 --> 12:24.280
So...how does it feel,

12:24.280 --> 12:28.960
letting John fly the coop? Well,
it may not seem this way now but...

12:28.960 --> 12:32.880
..what I did will eventually
be viewed as a great kindness.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.720
What do you mean?
He means, uh...

12:35.720 --> 12:38.920
He means letting me leave
without a fight, don't you, Dad?

12:40.120 --> 12:42.080
Right.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.160
I always thought
you'd pressed him into

12:44.160 --> 12:45.880
a kind of indentured servitude,

12:45.880 --> 12:48.920
so I was surprised when you let him
have his freedom.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.280
Girls, did I hear something
about a trifle?

12:52.280 --> 12:56.360
Yes. Come and help me
put the sprinkles on the trifle.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.920
This is Daddy's favourite, isn't it?

12:59.920 --> 13:02.440
So, um, you didn't tell her

13:02.440 --> 13:04.280
how it went down, did you?

13:06.040 --> 13:09.960
Look, if you want to dress things
up for the sake of your marriage,

13:09.960 --> 13:12.040
I understand.
What are you doing here, Dad?

13:13.520 --> 13:16.480
I'm at lunch,
what does it look like?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.920
Yeah. Just thought
you'd pop in for lunch?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.120
Yeah, like I always do.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.080
See you and Ruth and the grandkids.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.000
You fired me.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.240
Like I said, it was nothing
personal, only business.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.280
Ah, business. You are ruining me,
do you know that?

13:35.280 --> 13:39.680
You have to be able
to compartmentalise things, boy.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.880
Work and family
are two different things.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.360
We're family, always will be.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.480
Here we are.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.120
Oh, my goodness. That is delicious.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.480
Son? Is that not delicious, son?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.920
It's whatever you say it is, Dad.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.680
I'll get some bowls. Yeah.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.720
Can I get six flat whites
with oat milk,

14:07.720 --> 14:12.040
two mint teas and a masala chai
for me? No worries, coming up.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.920
You're one thirsty lady. I drew
the short straw for the coffee run.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.080
Oh!

14:26.880 --> 14:30.120
Uh... Oof...

14:30.120 --> 14:33.680
Are you OK?
I'll be OK, I'm fine.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.000
Thank you.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.520
Low blood sugar. Thank you.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.680
I said to the bloke,
"What is your problem?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.480
"Nadger did a shit
out of the window."

14:52.480 --> 14:55.560
Anyway, long story short, my Uber
rating is down to a 4.3, so...

14:55.560 --> 14:58.120
Oh, hold on, chap, posh trim alert.
Your Ladyship!

14:58.120 --> 15:00.720
How lovely to see you. I'm afraid
Greg's not here at the moment.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.840
I know. It's you I wanted to see.
Fuck off, chap.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.520
How can I help, Your Ladyship?
I'd like to see my client account.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.480
Nay problemo.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.880
Um, I know you say you're a lesbian,

15:12.880 --> 15:16.120
and I am totally on board with that,

15:16.120 --> 15:21.000
but would you ever consider trying
it with a bloke?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.240
Oh, here we go.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.080
Can you see if I've made
any large donations

15:25.080 --> 15:26.920
to something called the BJC?

15:26.920 --> 15:31.320
Uh...yes, a very sizeable amount
several months ago.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.800
And Laycock Logistical Services?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.840
Again, a number of large amounts.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.520
In fact, you have one such payment
going out today.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.000
Freeze all payments this instant.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.720
What? Just do it.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.000
Who authorised these payments?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.560
Er, Greg. Why?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.520
What's going on?

15:51.520 --> 15:54.480
I need a drink.
Want to go and grab a drink?

15:54.480 --> 15:57.200
Does a rocking horse
have a wooden cock?

15:57.200 --> 16:00.080
Yeah, I would absolutely... Sorry!

16:01.720 --> 16:04.080
Apres-vous.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.760
How much is that ting, though?
Expensive. Expensive.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.160
Oh, shit, you lot, stay there.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.800
Yo. One sec, one sec, one sec.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.120
See you later.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.600
There you go. Thanks.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.000
Right, get some rest.
I'll take over.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.160
Margie, you ever start thinking
about a big old lobster dinner?

16:57.160 --> 17:00.960
Mm, no, I've never had lobster.
You never had lobster? Why?

17:00.960 --> 17:03.960
Well, I'm a single mum,
not Camilla Parker Bowles.

17:03.960 --> 17:08.000
Well, tonight
I'm taking you to dinner.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.720
A little fish restaurant
I've had my eye on.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.360
It's Wednesday, we can't go to a
restaurant, I've got a wash on.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.800
Table for four, seven o'clock,
it's already booked.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.360
Young Tom, throw on a necktie.
It's a high-class joint.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.800
Dad, is this some sort of
Last Supper thing?

17:22.800 --> 17:25.080
Have you got test results
you need to tell me?

17:25.080 --> 17:26.600
I'm fit as a fiddle.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.640
I just want to treat my family
to the finer things.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.240
Make up for lost time.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.200
I totally want to try lobster. Yeah.

17:35.200 --> 17:40.360
I totally want to eat a lobster.
Of course you do. Come on.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.120
Margie, put your best dress on.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.040
Let your old man treat ya.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.400
Lobster. Lemon. Mwah!

17:53.280 --> 17:54.760
Here we go!

17:54.760 --> 17:58.880
So, Yamani wants
to leave her husband. Really? Yeah.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.960
Last weekend, Book Group, she told
us that she would leave Raj

18:01.960 --> 18:04.640
for Benedict Cumberbatch
at the drop of a hat. Her words.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.360
That doesn't mean she's going to
leave her husband. That's like me

18:07.360 --> 18:09.960
saying I'd leave Ben
for Michael B Jordan,

18:09.960 --> 18:12.800
or Dad saying he'd leave
you for... Dame Helen Mirren.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.000
Celebrity crushes
don't mean anything.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.960
I also fancy Dame Helen Mirren.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.040
Oh, no, Ben's leaving me
for a national treasure!

18:27.440 --> 18:29.360
You're all idiots.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.680
Have you done a business plan?
What?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.360
For your food stall in Weston.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.040
Rani's sorting that.
Yeah, it's all in my head,

18:41.040 --> 18:43.120
I just need to get it down on paper.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.000
Well, I could help you with that.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.200
Your mother and I have been talking.

18:49.200 --> 18:53.000
We have some money put aside
for when Rani went to university

18:53.000 --> 18:56.040
but, uh, as it's not happening...

18:56.040 --> 19:00.040
We would like to help both of you
with the food stall.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.880
Really? Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

19:04.640 --> 19:08.560
Thank you! Thank you so much!

19:08.560 --> 19:10.960
Thank you. Thank you.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.760
Pleasure. Pleasure, pleasure.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.080
Hello?

19:16.080 --> 19:19.120
Time's up. Where's my money.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.840
We transferred the last
of the money to you.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.600
No, no, you're 10,000 short.
What?

19:27.600 --> 19:30.360
Deadline's today
and I told you if you missed it,

19:30.360 --> 19:32.280
I start hurting people you love.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.520
You want cream or custard
on your rhubarb crumble?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.800
I'll have custard, Mum.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.720
You having dinner
with your mum and dad?

19:40.720 --> 19:45.520
Yeah. Mm-hm. That's lovely.
My mum and dad have passed on.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.120
It's really important to treasure
time with your mum and dad

19:48.120 --> 19:50.960
cos they'll be gone one day.
Like tomorrow,

19:50.960 --> 19:53.480
if I don't get the rest
of my fucking money.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.280
Your dad and Ben are having
both cream and custard.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.320
Mum. I'm on the phone.
It's a simple yes or no.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.480
Yes. I'll have both. Oh, fine.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.240
I don't understand what's happened.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.720
Maybe there was some sort of problem
with the shell company.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.880
Not my concern.
A deadline's a deadline.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.040
I'm going to need more time
to figure out what happened.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.240
I warned you. No extensions,
no negotiations.

20:14.240 --> 20:19.000
You have till tomorrow morning
or you and I will both be orphans.

20:21.200 --> 20:27.720
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪

20:27.720 --> 20:30.280
Your crumble's getting cold.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.000
What's wrong?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.600
How is this happening?
How is this happ...?

20:37.600 --> 20:39.400
Why didn't you transfer the money?

20:39.400 --> 20:42.960
I did but Gabby stopped it and froze
her account. Unfreeze it.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.280
Only she can do that.
Then find her, you lanky bastard!

20:46.280 --> 20:49.000
I dunno where she is
and she's not answering her phone!

20:50.640 --> 20:52.960
We were done. We were done!

20:52.960 --> 20:55.960
Right. We're just going to have to
ask for a bit more time.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.960
This isn't asking a teacher
for an extension for an essay!

20:58.960 --> 21:02.240
He said he'd kill my parents!
OK. Right.

21:02.240 --> 21:07.000
How do we make £10,000 by tomorrow?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.160
We could...hold up a bank?

21:09.160 --> 21:12.400
We're not holding up a bank.
We could hold up...a petrol station.

21:12.400 --> 21:17.040
We're not holding up anything.
We could kidnap somebody rich.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.160
Gabby's dad's loaded.
We could kidnap Gabby

21:19.160 --> 21:21.880
and then threaten
to cut off her fingers every hour.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.800
OK, let's calm down, all right?
We're not in the Yakuza.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.000
And we'd run out of fingers
before her father paid a penny. Oh!

21:28.000 --> 21:30.680
Tony Robinson from Blackadder
lives locally. Is he rich?

21:30.680 --> 21:33.480
He's a white male actor.
We're not kidnapping Baldrick!

21:33.480 --> 21:36.200
We're not kidnapping anyone!
Do you have a better idea?!

21:36.200 --> 21:38.680
Pressure selling.
What's pressure selling?

21:38.680 --> 21:40.760
Huh? Pressure selling?
Yeah, what about it?

21:40.760 --> 21:43.080
You just brought it up.
No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

21:43.080 --> 21:48.520
You just mentioned pressure selling
as a way to make fast sales? Yes.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.760
We need to approach our client list
with a time limit.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.000
That's what we need to do. Bulk
offers, OK? And persistence closing.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.320
That's what we need to do.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.720
We don't let them go anywhere
until they have bought fast

21:57.720 --> 22:00.280
and they have bought in bulk.
I mean, it's a form of bullying...

22:00.280 --> 22:01.920
You'd know something about bullying,

22:01.920 --> 22:04.520
calling me a lanky bastard. Look in
the mirror once in a while.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.880
Who's a lanky bastard?

22:06.880 --> 22:10.560
You just said I was a lanky bastard.
What did you say?

22:16.400 --> 22:19.120
I will never be able to go back
to tuna in a can.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.160
You want another lobster,
I can tell.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.520
Do people have two in a row?

22:24.520 --> 22:27.120
One time in Maine, I ate five.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.000
For a bet, which I lost.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.480
How many did the other guy have?
I'm not sure,

22:32.480 --> 22:34.800
I was wheeled out
with butter poisoning.

22:37.560 --> 22:41.000
I might get a coffee.

22:43.560 --> 22:47.680
Oh! Masala chai.
You have to try a cup.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.760
Nothing washes down
shellfish better.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.040
OK, can we get two masala chais,
please?

23:00.760 --> 23:04.280
What's up? It's Lady G,
live from Bar Revelation,

23:04.280 --> 23:09.840
which is appropriate as I'm thinking
about telling you...a secret.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.280
Yes, yes, but we are about to close
up shop soon and I would hate

23:33.280 --> 23:34.760
for you to get to the weekend,

23:34.760 --> 23:37.400
not get your hands on a nice,
strong macchiato.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.000
What if you find yourself
real thirsty after we close?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.320
Yeah, fine, then - hang up.
Still there, are we?

23:43.320 --> 23:45.280
Cos you know a great offer
when you hear one,

23:45.280 --> 23:47.800
but this offer must end midnight.
Look, if I were you,

23:47.800 --> 23:51.440
I would stock up for the holidays.
Christmas. Easter. Half term.

23:51.440 --> 23:56.240
Take your pick.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. What?

23:56.240 --> 24:01.840
..you might think that he was,
you know, a nice sweet nerd.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.280
But he isn't. No.
And this is a story of discovery

24:06.280 --> 24:10.080
but also of betrayal,
and I'm not sure if I should tell it

24:10.080 --> 24:13.520
because if I do then, well, he
won't have a flatmate any more,

24:13.520 --> 24:17.360
he will have a cellmate.
Oh. Yeah. Shots fired.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.040
Is that live? Very.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.600
Does she know about
the money laundering? Dunno.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.800
I bet Claire's told her something.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.920
She is trying to take the BJC
away from me.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.400
She's not even from Bristol.
She's bloody Scottish!

24:32.400 --> 24:34.320
Bloody foreigners. Coming over here,

24:34.320 --> 24:37.360
stealing our black civil rights
groups, eh? Focus!

24:37.360 --> 24:41.040
You better find Gabby
and stop her talking.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.320
Go!

25:04.840 --> 25:07.240
Business is booming
all of a sudden.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.960
Oh, is any of that going spare?

25:21.240 --> 25:25.000
I'm back, unleashed. You know what?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.160
You shouldn't trust anyone.
Don't... Don't...

25:27.160 --> 25:29.720
Don't trust your...your family,
don't trust your friends,

25:29.720 --> 25:32.520
don't trust lawyers
called Greg Dillard.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.920
Yeah, and do you know what?
He's a fucking creep, actually.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.680
I went on his internet search
history once, just for fun, and he

25:37.680 --> 25:40.640
searched "Viagra, how much is too
much?" People need to know that

25:40.640 --> 25:46.200
they can't break my heart any more,
don't they? I mean, really?

25:46.200 --> 25:50.200
Let me know in the comments if you
think I should tell my story.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.840
Did she say Greg Dillard?
Mm-hm. What is that?

25:52.840 --> 25:55.640
Remember Lady Gabby?
Her live feed just popped up.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.040
She's on a massive bender,

25:57.040 --> 26:00.960
blabbering on about a criminal
conspiracy. What a hot mess.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.320
Bring her in. Huh? Remember that kid
who was in for armed robbery,

26:04.320 --> 26:06.080
we thought he had drug ties? Yeah.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.880
Well, the lawyer who magically
showed up to take his case...

26:08.880 --> 26:09.960
Was Greg Dillard.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.960
The same lawyer we saw in court
defending Christian Taylor.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.720
The same lawyer who's doing CS
at Bennysfield. Go.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.840
OK, I'm putting you down for three
flat whites and an expresso martini.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.640
I will offer you this at
a reduced price if you buy in bulk.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.560
Well, then throw a party.

26:40.560 --> 26:44.480
You'll be Mr Popular.
All right, cool.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.440
What are you going to say
to Grandad?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.440
Thank you for my lobster.
Thank you for my lobster.

26:50.440 --> 26:56.200
Yeah, thank you, Dad, for a lovely
evening. Oh, sure. And this is?

26:56.200 --> 27:02.240
Masala chai. Cardamom. Cinnamon.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.800
Cloves. Delicious.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.960
Mm!

27:16.200 --> 27:17.560
Smell that.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.760
I'd like to pay with this, please.
Of course.

27:50.400 --> 27:54.000
Where are you going? Inside?
My friends are all expecting me.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.280
Nah, you're not coming in here. Why
not? Cos the people we want in here

27:57.280 --> 28:00.920
look like they're going to provide
glamour, not IT support.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.880
Step aside, mate. All right?

28:03.880 --> 28:05.840
Gabby! Mate,
step away from the glass

28:05.840 --> 28:08.440
before I put your head through
it. Seriously. Just let me in. No.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.680
Now, move. Come on.
All right, I'm going.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.240
I could laugh at you if I want.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.080
Gabby! Ga...

29:13.000 --> 29:16.680
Cool. I'll send someone to you now.
Ah, but this is a one-time deal.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.960
Yeah. Only for our most
valued customers.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.280
You absolutely are, madam, yes,
both you and your grandson.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.400
All right,
so shall we say your usual?

29:25.400 --> 29:29.120
Oh, yeah. We've got our own
dedicated delivery team.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.840
Karmacoma, Jamaica and Roma.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.880
Hiya. What?
Can I come in, please?

30:26.880 --> 30:29.120
Password?

30:29.120 --> 30:31.080
Is it my mother's maiden name?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.280
Jesus! Woo!

31:37.720 --> 31:40.920
Don't mind me,
I'm just...passing through.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.320
Greg? Yeah?

31:43.320 --> 31:44.840
It's Rosie.

31:44.840 --> 31:48.560
I was giving you a blowie when you
reversed into that police car.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.160
Oh, right, yeah. How's it going?

31:51.160 --> 31:54.320
Yeah, yeah, mustn't grumble.
Keeping busy.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.760
What happened that night with you,
after?

31:56.760 --> 32:00.040
Cos I just got off with a warning.
Did you? Yeah. Yeah, I got, um,

32:00.040 --> 32:03.440
120 hours of community service.
Oh, no. Yeah.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.880
How did it go?
Not great, if I'm honest.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.840
I ended up getting blackmailed

32:08.840 --> 32:11.440
and now I'm in hock to
a ruthless London drug dealer.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.760
I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.840
Oi! I'm sorry to break up
this little reunion

32:16.840 --> 32:19.680
but I'm paying by the hour here,
mate. Oh!

32:19.680 --> 32:22.800
Shut up, you little bitch!
Yes, mistress. Eh, listen.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.320
I'm done here in 20 minutes
if you want anything doing.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.320
We could finish that blowie
that you never got.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.640
That's very good of you, but no,
I can't, actually,

32:30.640 --> 32:33.440
cos I've got to quickly try and find
one of my other clients before she,

32:33.440 --> 32:36.840
um, sends me to jail.
Oh. You have been a bad boy.

32:36.840 --> 32:40.120
Anyway, lovely to see you.
It's been good to see you.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.960
Thank you so much.
Sorry for interrupting you.

32:44.040 --> 32:48.640
Woo! You've been a bad boy!
Oh, yes, you have!

32:57.040 --> 32:58.200
Ooh!

33:00.080 --> 33:01.320
Evening.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.280
I don't suppose you've got
a member of the landed gentry

33:08.280 --> 33:09.600
in here, have you?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.320
There's so many whips.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.760
Gabby!

33:46.280 --> 33:47.440
Gabby?

33:58.440 --> 33:59.640
Gabby?

34:07.640 --> 34:08.720
Gabby.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.000
Judas!
Can we speak in private, please?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.560
Anything you have to say,

34:14.560 --> 34:17.960
you can say in front of
my real friends here.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.480
There's a policeman here.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.320
Good. I have things to say to him.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.960
Just let me explain first.
It's too late for explaining.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.360
Just hear me out. And if you still
want to turn me in,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.880
I won't stop you.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.560
Please.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.640
Police.

34:43.640 --> 34:47.240
Has anyone seen
Lady Gabriella Penrose-Howe?

34:47.240 --> 34:50.040
Right, then, you cheeky little
monkeys. Guess who's brought

34:50.040 --> 34:52.880
the goods. We have got Chang
and a lovely bit of MD...Mmm...

34:52.880 --> 34:56.000
..mazing that you are here, Detective,

34:56.000 --> 34:59.800
because these are drugs.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.000
Yuck.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.560
Did you find my watch, by the way?

35:13.920 --> 35:17.560
We should get a move on, I think.
I want an explanation, right now.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.880
Shall we do that at home over

35:18.880 --> 35:21.760
a cup of tea and a Mr Kipling? No,
explain. What have you been doing?

35:21.760 --> 35:25.240
It's... It's so complicated, Gabby.
Well, then un-complicate it, Greg.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.560
I've been using your client account

35:28.560 --> 35:30.880
to launder the proceeds of
an illegal drug operation.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.600
Right. That's it, is it? Yeah.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.480
Cool. Great.

35:38.480 --> 35:42.880
Great. Shall we go?
No, not great, Greg! Not cool!

35:42.880 --> 35:44.920
You've been using me to launder...?!

35:47.160 --> 35:51.480
So when you...when you said that
everyone else in my life was a mooch

35:51.480 --> 35:54.920
and a hanger-on and I thought that
that meant you really cared about

35:54.920 --> 35:57.000
me, that was bollocks?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.360
No, I do care about you. Of course.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.240
How can you say that?!

36:01.240 --> 36:05.440
Literally no-one in my life
has used me more than you!

36:07.400 --> 36:09.160
I know. I'm sorry.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.320
You're my consigliere.

36:15.320 --> 36:18.880
I know you hired me
to protect you and look after you

36:18.880 --> 36:20.840
and, uh, I betrayed you.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.400
But you have to know, I would never
deliberately hurt you.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.720
You know, money laundering
and exploiting you,

36:27.720 --> 36:29.800
that's not something
I would choose to do.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.920
It's not just that you're my lawyer, Greg.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.240
I thought you were my friend.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.600
I am your friend.

36:43.480 --> 36:46.040
I know. I'm so sorry, Gabby.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.920
I don't even know how
I ended up doing this.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.200
All I know is that there's guns,
and threats,

36:51.200 --> 36:54.040
and everyone's lives are in danger
if I don't do this.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.960
Whose lives? Who else is involved?

36:59.960 --> 37:03.040
Rani, Ben, Myrna, John, Frank.

37:05.160 --> 37:08.400
I'm the only one
who doesn't know about this?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.440
Yeah.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.200
Yup, all here.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.520
Go on, kids, be on your way.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.800
Police are watching the building.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.200
What we going to do?

38:37.200 --> 38:39.160
Fuck. We're all fucked.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.560
Our humble thanks
for attending Fight Back Bristol.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.040
We'll be back next week,

39:10.040 --> 39:12.440
so be sure
to tell all of your friends.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.160
And remember -

39:14.160 --> 39:17.080
we will NEVER give up on you

39:17.080 --> 39:19.560
so, please, don't give up
on yourselves.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.840
And if anyone should offer you
drugs, what do we do?

39:23.840 --> 39:25.360
Just say no.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.560
Fight Back Bristol? What is that?

39:51.560 --> 39:55.240
Grassroots initiative.
People like us with criminal records

39:55.240 --> 39:57.680
just trying to ensure that the kids

39:57.680 --> 40:00.200
don't make the same mistakes
that we did. I mean,

40:00.200 --> 40:02.920
can't wait for the system
to step in, can you?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.840
So you're all activists now?

40:07.840 --> 40:09.680
Just caring members of the community.

40:13.520 --> 40:17.320
You're feeling a deep ideological
connection to the movement, are you?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.240
What's your home address?

40:27.480 --> 40:29.520
He lives in Clifton Towns.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.600
He can't speak for himself?
Well, yeah, of course he can.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.240
But if what you're implying
is that there's no place

40:35.240 --> 40:37.240
for a white, middle-class man in this,

40:37.240 --> 40:39.160
then you'd be wrong. In some ways...

40:39.160 --> 40:41.440
Spare me the lecture. Please.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.840
Are we OK? Everyone OK?

41:05.840 --> 41:08.960
John, are you OK?
That was close! Ha!

41:08.960 --> 41:12.840
Yeah, way too close.
Definitely way too close.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.600
Oh, come on, you've got to admit -
it's a bit of a thrill.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.480
We weren't ziplining, Rani.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.920
Oh, my God. You're so boring!

41:20.920 --> 41:24.640
I don't want to run around
with drugs and guns and money.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.880
That's different to being boring.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.080
Be careful, Rani.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.840
You know who told me this before?

41:31.840 --> 41:34.840
Who? Christian Taylor.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.520
And that's why he's in jail

41:36.520 --> 41:37.560
and I'm not.

41:39.480 --> 41:43.040
Hi, lovelies.
How's the drug dealing going?

41:44.320 --> 41:46.080
You told her?

41:55.040 --> 41:58.640
My mum killed herself
when I was six years old.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.120
My dad was never home

42:00.120 --> 42:05.040
so I was just passed
from caretaker to caretaker.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.120
Never really had a real family.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.600
But all of us over the past
few months, working together,

42:13.600 --> 42:14.920
laughing together...

42:16.760 --> 42:20.240
..it's kind of felt like
we were a family.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.600
I'm sorry, Gabby.
We should never have involved you.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.280
I can only imagine how upsetting
it must be to wake up

42:30.280 --> 42:35.240
and find yourself embroiled
in a criminal conspiracy.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.360
I'm not upset
because you've involved me

42:37.360 --> 42:39.840
in a criminal conspiracy.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.840
I'm upset because you haven't.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.920
What?
I know everything about drugs.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.960
I've been using them
since I was 12.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.800
I know what's good,
I know what's bad,

42:50.800 --> 42:53.960
I know the jargon, the prices.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.920
I could help you.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.320
So you're saying you WANT to be
a part of a criminal conspiracy?

42:59.320 --> 43:00.360
Yes!

43:02.000 --> 43:04.280
Now, which one of you is the Mr Big?

43:26.680 --> 43:28.520
What happened to you last night?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.560
I-I talked my way out of it

43:31.560 --> 43:33.120
but it was so awkward

43:33.120 --> 43:36.360
that even the bloke in the gimp mask
couldn't look at me.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.680
Luckily, I managed to get away
when an ambulance showed up.

43:39.680 --> 43:42.280
Some pervert got his fist
stuck inside someone else.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.000
Did he lose his watch as well?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.520
I need to make a fresh transfer
to Laycock Logistical Services.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.920
W—We froze the account.
Well, now we need to thaw it out

43:49.920 --> 43:54.120
cos I've got a lot of logistics I
need servicing. So, chop chop. Um...

44:26.480 --> 44:27.600
We did it.

44:36.120 --> 44:37.320
Ain't you happy?

44:38.920 --> 44:42.320
Yeah. Of course I am.
Tell your face then.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.120
What's eating you?

44:48.120 --> 44:50.440
Nothing. Well, I...

44:52.200 --> 44:54.560
Ben said something but...

44:54.560 --> 44:56.840
..it doesn't matter. It's fine.
What did he say?

44:59.360 --> 45:01.040
He said I remind him of you.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.400
When you was in the sack?

45:03.400 --> 45:05.320
No. When we were arguing.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.840
I said he was boring,

45:10.840 --> 45:13.280
then he said that...

45:13.280 --> 45:15.800
..I'm enjoying
this gang shit too much.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.400
Are you?

45:20.760 --> 45:21.880
No.

45:25.720 --> 45:28.440
When me and Ben
were just young guys,

45:28.440 --> 45:31.360
olders in our neighbourhood
all had cars,

45:31.360 --> 45:35.600
nice jewellery and cash,
working for The Dean.

45:35.600 --> 45:38.960
There was easy money to be made
running with them.

45:38.960 --> 45:45.560
And on top of that,
the status and respect and...

45:45.560 --> 45:49.120
..you know,
the hype gets addictive, right?

45:51.000 --> 45:54.840
Your boy Ben was smart. He resisted.

45:54.840 --> 45:58.320
Me? I started in country,

45:58.320 --> 46:00.440
then started running my own team.

46:00.440 --> 46:04.240
And the whole time, I'm thinking,
"This isn't who I am."

46:04.240 --> 46:08.240
I'll just make some quick P's
then go back to where I was.

46:08.240 --> 46:12.360
But one day, you wake up
and it IS who you are.

46:12.360 --> 46:15.520
And it's too late to go back
to where you was.

46:15.520 --> 46:19.000
And the next thing you know, you're
wearing the same grey tracksuit

46:19.000 --> 46:21.520
with the same grey socks
and the same grey underwear -

46:21.520 --> 46:24.360
because they're all washed
together -

46:24.360 --> 46:28.920
spending 23 hours a day in
the same four-square-metre room.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.520
Take it from me...

46:31.840 --> 46:33.440
..that's boring.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.800
Four black Americanos,
a masala chai

46:49.800 --> 46:51.640
and a piece of that cake.

46:51.640 --> 46:53.320
Right, two seconds.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.920
Morning.

46:57.920 --> 47:02.680
Right, there is a coffee there
for you

47:02.680 --> 47:06.400
and a masala ch... Ooh!

47:06.400 --> 47:10.040
Shit! I am so sorry. Oh!

47:10.040 --> 47:12.160
Let's just get that off of there.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.200
Doesn't matter that it's a bit
dry in there.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.720
Sorry about that. I'm more
fingers than thumbs today.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.760
Right, let me get you
some more tissues... Please.

47:25.760 --> 47:26.800
Coffee...

47:27.800 --> 47:30.480
Oh... Right, tissues, tissues.

47:33.440 --> 47:36.040
What was you doing in
the house, all alone with a boy,

47:36.040 --> 47:38.760
without telling me? It's my house,
too. Oh, it's your house?

47:38.760 --> 47:42.240
Do you pay bills? Do you know what?
Furthermore, give me your phone.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.880
Why? Give me your phone.
I want to know who the guy is.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.240
Give me your phone.
He's none of your business.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.000
It was past midnight
on a school night

47:49.000 --> 47:52.160
and you were here chilling
with some boy. We were studying!

47:52.160 --> 47:55.240
This is why I want to live with Mum.
Because she lets me do what I want.

47:55.240 --> 47:58.320
It's because she's a smackhead!
Not any more!

47:58.320 --> 48:01.560
She just trusts me.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.840
Dickhead.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.040
You have to let her
live her own life. Sometimes.

48:13.040 --> 48:17.960
Not yet I don't. She's 16.
You can't protect her all the time.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.200
Yeah, well, I can try.
Well, my parents tried.

48:21.200 --> 48:24.280
They tried to wrap me up
in cotton wool my whole life.

48:25.960 --> 48:27.560
Look how I turned out.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.200
I'm a drug dealer.

48:36.280 --> 48:40.720
OK. You're not...boring.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.760
You're right.

48:42.760 --> 48:45.360
I was getting hooked on buzz.

48:45.360 --> 48:46.600
So, anyway,

48:46.600 --> 48:47.680
it...

48:48.800 --> 48:51.360
It's over. I'm back.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.480
I'm sorry.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.920
You were starting to scare me there.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.440
I thought I was sharing a bed
with the Godfather.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.720
About Es.

49:13.720 --> 49:17.680
If things go wrong with your mum,
she knows where to find you.

49:22.320 --> 49:26.000
Myrna? Claire?
Um, have you got a minute?

49:27.400 --> 49:29.280
I just found something a bit odd,

49:29.280 --> 49:31.840
and I was wondering if you could
help me get to the bottom of it.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.160
Something odd?

49:33.160 --> 49:35.720
Yeah, I was just going through
the BJC bank account - you know,

49:35.720 --> 49:38.120
doing the money laundering
due diligence and everything.

49:38.120 --> 49:42.720
I just found this payment
on Claire's company card for £518.

49:42.720 --> 49:45.800
What? Let me see.
Is that your card number?

49:45.800 --> 49:49.280
Yes, but what's Le Grande Poisson?

49:49.280 --> 49:51.680
I think it means "the big fish".
It's, um,

49:51.680 --> 49:55.080
a fancy seafood place in Clifton.
But did you use your BJC card

49:55.080 --> 49:56.880
to pay for a meal in there
or anything?

49:56.880 --> 50:00.760
No, I've never even been there. No?
It's probably some kind of mistake.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.360
Greg, could you call them,
please? On it.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.920
Le Grand Poisson, how may I help?

50:10.920 --> 50:13.360
Uh, hi. Can I speak to your manager,
please? This is he.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.400
Hi, my name's Myrna
and I just wanted to check

50:15.400 --> 50:18.880
and see if a credit card was used
in your restaurant last night.

50:18.880 --> 50:22.320
It ends in...

50:22.320 --> 50:23.720
Hold on, please.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.480
Someone probably stole your card.
No, it's here.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.000
Yes. That card was used here
last night. Right, um,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
can you tell me
what it was spent on?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.240
Three dozen oysters,
four lobster mains,

50:36.240 --> 50:39.000
a truffle mac and cheese,
two bottles of champagne...

50:39.000 --> 50:42.520
Someone was peckish.
..and two masala chais.

50:44.200 --> 50:48.480
Right, so, that's your drink,
isn't it? Yes, but... OK, thank you.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.120
You're welcome.

50:50.120 --> 50:54.200
Claire, if you were in my position,

50:54.200 --> 50:55.680
what would you do right now?

50:57.000 --> 51:00.840
This is... Someone has done this.
Done what?

51:00.840 --> 51:02.760
I don't know. Made it look like...

51:02.760 --> 51:05.800
Claire, it gives me
no pleasure to say this

51:05.800 --> 51:08.480
but, while we investigate
this matter,

51:08.480 --> 51:11.400
I feel I have to suspend you.

51:11.400 --> 51:14.360
Suspend me?
We need to be whiter-than-white.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.680
Erm...

51:20.320 --> 51:21.400
Yeah, sure.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.160
What?

51:57.440 --> 52:00.480
Activism is a fight.
Sometimes, you have to fight dirty.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.440
What was I supposed to do?

52:17.040 --> 52:18.080
Hey.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.480
Hey.

52:24.720 --> 52:29.520
Hey, you were right. You know,
about giving people second chances.

52:29.520 --> 52:32.640
About forgiveness.
Seriously?

52:33.840 --> 52:35.960
If you ever need anything,

52:35.960 --> 52:40.200
just pick up the phone
and I'll come, yeah? I'll be there.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.920
Come here.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.200
Thanks, Ben.

53:06.040 --> 53:08.480
We need to go for a little ride.

53:12.040 --> 53:14.160
You got me anything
from the gift shop?

53:14.160 --> 53:17.640
All I've got for you is a deal.
I'd prefer a muffin.

53:17.640 --> 53:20.640
I know Rani Rekowski and her friends
are running your crew.

53:20.640 --> 53:24.080
And I know you're all in bed
with The Dean.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.840
Do you know the numbers
for this week's EuroMillions?

53:27.840 --> 53:30.240
Co-operate.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.360
Help me collar The Dean,

53:32.360 --> 53:36.520
and I'll get you out of here.
How does that sound?

53:36.520 --> 53:39.360
Like a great episode
of Line Of Duty.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.520
Do you think it hasn't been noticed
by people in here

53:45.520 --> 53:48.000
how many times I've visited you?

53:48.000 --> 53:49.280
Do you know how easy it would be

53:49.280 --> 53:52.200
for me to spread the word around
that you're my favourite informant?

53:54.120 --> 53:56.320
How long do you think
you'd last after that?

53:59.840 --> 54:01.400
Think about my offer.

54:33.120 --> 54:35.440
Evening, all.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.720
I have good news

54:37.720 --> 54:41.280
and I have even better news.

54:42.760 --> 54:46.680
The good news is, I have received
payment, in full, on time,

54:46.680 --> 54:49.960
as you promised. I'll be honest,
I didn't think you'd make it.

54:49.960 --> 54:54.600
And my boys are livid. They dug
ditches out the back for nothing.

54:54.600 --> 54:58.760
Now, on to the even better news.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.400
What's that? This, my dear,

55:01.400 --> 55:05.560
is ten kilos of pure uncut cocaine

55:05.560 --> 55:09.080
that you are going to shift for me.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.520
No. We're done.

55:11.520 --> 55:14.360
No, you're The Beatles
of drug selling

55:14.360 --> 55:17.280
and I can't break up the band.
Don't make me the Yoko.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.800
And think of this
as your White Album.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.000
This isn't fair!

55:21.000 --> 55:22.600
We did what you asked!

55:22.600 --> 55:23.960
Fair?

55:25.560 --> 55:30.040
You're lucky your parents
aren't on TV, in tears,

55:30.040 --> 55:35.640
asking for information
of your fucking whereabouts.

55:35.640 --> 55:38.720
We're not doing it. This is over.

55:38.720 --> 55:42.120
This is over when I say it's over.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.760
And I'm sorry,

55:43.760 --> 55:46.800
but it ain't fucking over.

56:04.400 --> 56:05.960
He's never going to stop.

56:05.960 --> 56:09.920
Why would he?
He's on to a good thing.

56:09.920 --> 56:14.240
I cannot deal drugs
for the rest of my days.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.560
Obviously! None of us can.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.760
Right, what are we going to do?

56:19.760 --> 56:22.120
We'll kill him.
Sorry, what?

56:24.040 --> 56:28.600
Well, any other ideas
before we settle on murder?

56:28.600 --> 56:31.320
Anyone heard of the Brass Bunkum?
