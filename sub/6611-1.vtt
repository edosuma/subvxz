00:23.615 --> 00:25.900
So stay with us,
because later this afternoon,

00:25.935 --> 00:28.186
we're lucky enough to be
talking to Anna Scott,

00:28.221 --> 00:29.986
Hollywood's biggest
star by far.

00:30.021 --> 00:33.331
Miss Scott's latest film is
once again topping the charts...

02:26.304 --> 02:30.708
Of course, I've seen her films and
always thought she was, well, fabulous.

02:30.743 --> 02:34.212
But, you know, a million, million
miles from the world I live in.

02:34.247 --> 02:36.565
Which is here, Notting Hill.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.509
My favorite bit of London.

02:38.544 --> 02:40.383
There's the market on weekdays

02:40.418 --> 02:43.125
selling every fruit
and vegetable known to man.

02:43.521 --> 02:45.907
Rock hard bananas,
five for a pound!

02:45.942 --> 02:48.258
The tattoo parlor
with a guy outside

02:48.293 --> 02:51.831
who got drunk and now can't
remember why he chose "I love Ken. "

02:52.630 --> 02:55.967
The radical hairdressers, where
everyone comes out looking like

02:56.002 --> 02:59.204
the Cookie Monster,
whether they want to or not.

02:59.239 --> 03:01.204
And then, suddenly,
it's the weekend

03:01.239 --> 03:04.209
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere

03:04.244 --> 03:07.177
filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.

03:07.212 --> 03:10.982
And wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques,

03:11.017 --> 03:14.930
some genuine,
and some not quite so genuine.

03:16.421 --> 03:19.724
And what's great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London.

03:19.759 --> 03:23.226
That's Tony, for example,
architect turned chef

03:23.261 --> 03:26.698
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant.

03:26.733 --> 03:29.468
And so, this is where
I spend my days and years,

03:29.503 --> 03:32.168
in this small village
in the middle of the city,

03:32.203 --> 03:35.338
in a house with a blue door that
my wife and I bought together

03:35.373 --> 03:39.227
before she left me for a man who
looked exactly like Harrison Ford.

03:39.262 --> 03:43.081
And where I now lead a strange
half-life with a lodger called...

03:43.116 --> 03:44.082
Spike?

03:48.953 --> 03:50.186
Hi.

03:50.221 --> 03:53.458
You couldn't help me with an incredibly
important decision, could you?

03:53.493 --> 03:55.377
Is this important
in comparison to, let's say,

03:55.412 --> 03:57.227
whether they should cancel
Third World debt?

03:57.262 --> 04:00.798
That's right. I'm at last going
out on a date with the great Janine

04:00.833 --> 04:02.934
and I just wanna be sure
I've picked the right T-shirt.

04:02.969 --> 04:05.414
What are the choices?
Well, wait for it.

04:13.311 --> 04:16.223
First there's this one.
Cool, huh?

04:16.781 --> 04:20.728
Yeah, it might make it hard to
strike a really romantic note.

04:21.252 --> 04:23.086
Point taken. Don't despair.

04:23.121 --> 04:26.727
If it's romance we're looking for
I believe I have just the thing.

04:31.796 --> 04:35.266
Yeah, well, there again, she might not
think you had true love on your mind.

04:35.301 --> 04:37.678
Right. Just one more.

04:44.142 --> 04:45.746
True love here I come.

04:51.716 --> 04:55.391
Well, yeah. Yeah,
that's, that's perfect.

04:56.721 --> 05:00.031
Great. Thanks. Wish me luck.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.062
Good luck.

05:07.632 --> 05:09.866
And so it was just
another hopeless Wednesday

05:09.901 --> 05:13.236
as I walked the thousand yards
through the market to work,

05:13.271 --> 05:17.446
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.855
This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.379
Morning, Martin.

05:23.414 --> 05:24.620
Morning, Monseigneur.

05:25.316 --> 05:28.351
Which, well,
sells travel books

05:28.386 --> 05:31.696
and to be frank with you,
doesn't always sell many of those.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.693
Classic.

05:36.728 --> 05:42.109
Profit from major sales push,
minus Â£347.

05:44.669 --> 05:47.438
Shall I go and get
you a cappuccino?

05:47.473 --> 05:49.140
You know, ease the pain a bit.

05:49.175 --> 05:50.540
Yeah. Yeah.

05:50.575 --> 05:53.112
Better make it a half.
All I can afford.

05:54.178 --> 05:56.851
Get your logic.
Demi-cappu coming right up.

06:23.641 --> 06:25.279
Can I help you at all?

06:26.544 --> 06:28.990
No, thanks,
I'll just look around.

06:31.049 --> 06:32.118
Fine.

06:39.724 --> 06:42.125
That book's really not great.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.438
Just in case browsing turned to
buying, you'd be wasting your money.

06:47.699 --> 06:52.170
But if it's Turkey you're interested in,
this one, on the other hand, is very good.

06:53.738 --> 06:57.515
I think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.

06:57.809 --> 07:00.619
There's also a very amusing
incident with a kebab

07:01.145 --> 07:03.522
which is one of many
amusing incidents.

07:03.748 --> 07:05.315
Thanks, I'll think about it.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.092
Or, in the bigger
hard-back variety, there's...

07:09.053 --> 07:11.430
I'm sorry,
can you just give me a second?

07:15.526 --> 07:16.629
Excuse me.

07:17.795 --> 07:19.467
Yes?
Bad news.

07:20.331 --> 07:21.597
What?

07:21.632 --> 07:24.578
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.

07:25.136 --> 07:26.202
So?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.876
So I saw you put that
book down your trousers.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.275
What book?

07:32.310 --> 07:33.754
The one down your trousers.

07:35.012 --> 07:37.287
I don't have a book
down my trousers.

07:38.683 --> 07:42.552
Right, I tell you what,
I'll call the police

07:42.587 --> 07:46.090
and what can I say, if I'm wrong about
the whole book- down-the-trousers scenario,

07:46.125 --> 07:47.590
I really apologize.

07:47.625 --> 07:52.039
Okay. What if I did have
a book down my trousers?

07:52.563 --> 07:55.198
Well, ideally,
when I went back to the desk

07:55.233 --> 07:59.070
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers

07:59.105 --> 08:02.881
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.

08:04.075 --> 08:05.679
I'll see you in a sec.

08:06.844 --> 08:08.379
I'm sorry about that.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.554
No, it's fine.

08:11.749 --> 08:14.627
I was gonna steal one
but now I've changed my mind.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.796
Signed by the author, I see.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.324
Yeah, couldn't stop him.

08:21.359 --> 08:24.897
If you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

08:26.364 --> 08:27.764
Excuse me.
Yes?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.539
Can I have your autograph?

08:30.935 --> 08:32.345
Sure.
Here.

08:34.172 --> 08:35.912
What's your name?
Rufus.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.456
What does it say?

08:45.049 --> 08:49.122
That's my signature, and above it, it
says "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail. "

08:49.687 --> 08:50.688
Good one.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.500
Do you want my phone number?

08:55.293 --> 08:58.171
Tempting, but no.

08:59.063 --> 09:00.166
Thank you.

09:03.901 --> 09:05.436
I will take this one.

09:06.137 --> 09:07.303
Oh, right, right.

09:07.338 --> 09:12.014
So, well, on second thoughts
maybe it's not that bad after all.

09:12.977 --> 09:15.389
Actually it's a sort
of classic, really.

09:15.746 --> 09:19.750
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

09:21.285 --> 09:23.553
I tell you what, I'll throw
in one of those for free.

09:23.588 --> 09:28.469
Useful for lighting fires,
wrapping fish, that sort of thing.

09:32.797 --> 09:34.401
Thanks.
Pleasure.

10:04.629 --> 10:08.668
Here we are.
Cappuccino, as ordered.

10:10.368 --> 10:11.369
Thanks.

10:12.603 --> 10:15.439
I don't think you'll believe
who was just in here.

10:15.474 --> 10:17.816
Who? Was it someone famous?

10:19.510 --> 10:21.677
No, no, no.

10:21.712 --> 10:25.819
Would be exciting though, wouldn't it,
if someone famous came into the shop?

10:26.617 --> 10:32.089
Do you know, this is pretty amazing
actually, but I once saw Ringo Starr.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.426
Where was that?
Kensington High Street.

10:35.461 --> 10:36.492
At least I think it was Ringo.

10:36.527 --> 10:40.064
It might have been that man
from Fiddler On The Roof.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.165
You know, Toppy.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.302
Topol.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.407
Yes, that's right. Topol.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.576
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't
look at all like Topol.

10:51.611 --> 10:54.283
Yeah, but he was quite
a long way away from me.

10:54.979 --> 10:57.550
So actually it could've
been neither of them?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.087
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

11:01.085 --> 11:02.486
It's not a classic anecdote,
is it?

11:02.521 --> 11:04.397
Not a classic, no. No.

11:09.594 --> 11:11.164
Another one?

11:11.829 --> 11:16.107
Yes. No! Let's go crazy.
I'll have an orange juice.

11:22.773 --> 11:25.082
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.
See you later.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.302
Shit! Bugger!
Oh, my God!

11:35.337 --> 11:37.288
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.754
Here let me...

11:38.789 --> 11:39.989
Get your hands off!

11:40.024 --> 11:43.210
I'm really sorry.
I live just over the street.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.222
I have water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

11:46.257 --> 11:49.200
No, thank you. I just
need to get my car back.

11:49.235 --> 11:50.533
I also have a phone.

11:50.568 --> 11:52.134
I'm confident
that in five minutes

11:52.169 --> 11:54.839
we can have you spick and span
and back on the street again.

11:54.874 --> 11:57.581
In the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.

12:01.278 --> 12:02.381
All right.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.991
Well, what do you mean "just over
the street"? Give it to me in yards.

12:07.318 --> 12:10.788
Eighteen yards. That's my house
there with the blue front door.

12:15.559 --> 12:17.732
Come on in.
I'll just, I'll just...

12:22.900 --> 12:24.310
Right. Right.

12:25.236 --> 12:29.472
Come in. It's not quite as
tidy as it normally is, I fear.

12:29.507 --> 12:34.956
But the bathroom's on the top floor.
And the telephone's just up here.

12:38.015 --> 12:39.391
Here, let me...

12:47.191 --> 12:49.830
Round the corner,
straight on, straight on up.

12:53.631 --> 12:54.632
Bugger!

13:18.022 --> 13:19.757
Would you like a cup
of tea before you go?

13:19.792 --> 13:20.792
No.

13:22.026 --> 13:23.505
Coffee?
No.

13:24.695 --> 13:25.935
Orange juice?

13:27.264 --> 13:28.504
Probably not.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.034
Something else cold?

13:34.638 --> 13:36.139
Coke? Water?

13:37.641 --> 13:39.408
Some disgusting sugary drink

13:39.443 --> 13:41.679
pretending to have something
to do with fruits of the forest?

13:41.714 --> 13:42.680
No.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.116
Would you like
something to eat?

13:45.416 --> 13:49.955
Something to nibble?
Apricots soaked in honey?

13:51.088 --> 13:52.321
Quite why, no one knows,

13:52.356 --> 13:56.736
because it stops them tasting of
apricots and makes them taste like honey,

13:57.495 --> 14:01.465
and if you wanted honey you'd
just buy honey instead of apricots.

14:03.367 --> 14:06.780
But nevertheless, there we go,
they're yours if you want them.

14:07.204 --> 14:08.205
No.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.418
Do you always say
"no" to everything?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.148
No.

14:19.650 --> 14:24.292
I'd better be going.
Thanks for your... help.

14:25.689 --> 14:26.789
You're welcome.

14:26.824 --> 14:31.500
And may I also say... heavenly.

14:33.230 --> 14:34.965
I'll just take my
one chance to say it.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.665
After you've read
that terrible book

14:36.700 --> 14:39.737
you're certainly not gonna
be coming back to the shop.

14:40.538 --> 14:41.641
Thank you.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.920
Yeah, well, my pleasure.

14:57.621 --> 15:01.694
So... it was nice to meet you.

15:03.227 --> 15:05.798
Surreal but nice.

15:08.766 --> 15:09.767
Sorry.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.855
"Surreal but nice. "
What was I thinking?

15:33.424 --> 15:35.028
Hi.
Hi.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.695
I forgot my other bag.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.230
Oh, right. Right.

15:49.373 --> 15:50.374
Thanks.

16:21.839 --> 16:25.582
I'm very sorry about the
"surreal but nice" comment.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.411
Disaster.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.510
That's okay.

16:28.545 --> 16:32.754
I thought the apricot and honey
thing was the real low point.

16:36.153 --> 16:40.567
Oh, my God. My flatmate. I'm
sorry. There's no excuse for him.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.394
Hi.
Hi.

16:45.429 --> 16:47.798
I'm just going into the
kitchen to get some food.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.565
Then I'm gonna tell you
a story that will

16:49.600 --> 16:52.478
make your balls
shrink to the size of raisins.

16:57.608 --> 17:00.179
Probably best not
to tell anyone about this.

17:01.245 --> 17:03.554
Right. Right, no one.

17:04.448 --> 17:07.986
I'll tell myself sometimes but,
don't worry, I won't believe it.

17:15.358 --> 17:16.859
Goodbye.
Bye.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.043
There's something
wrong with this yoghurt.

17:34.244 --> 17:36.981
It's not yoghurt.
It's mayonnaise.

17:37.016 --> 17:38.357
Oh, right. There we are then.

17:41.885 --> 17:43.864
On for a videofest tonight?

17:45.622 --> 17:48.034
I got some absolute classics.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.640
Smile.
No.

17:57.768 --> 17:59.101
Smile.

17:59.136 --> 18:01.377
I've got nothing
to smile about.

18:11.648 --> 18:17.359
Okay, in about seven seconds
I'm going to ask you to marry me.

18:25.596 --> 18:31.045
Imagine... somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.

18:34.905 --> 18:40.047
She is... fairly fabulous.

18:49.553 --> 18:51.288
Do you have any
books by Dickens?

18:51.323 --> 18:52.454
No.

18:52.489 --> 18:56.960
No, I'm afraid we're a travel
bookshop. We only sell travel books.

18:58.629 --> 19:01.700
Oh, right. How about the
new John Grisham thriller?

19:03.267 --> 19:06.714
Well, no, because that's
a novel too, isn't it?

19:08.038 --> 19:09.141
Oh, right.

19:13.911 --> 19:15.822
Have you got Winnie-the-Pooh?

19:18.148 --> 19:20.651
Martin, your customer.

19:20.686 --> 19:21.925
Can I help you?

19:34.364 --> 19:35.702
Hey.

19:35.737 --> 19:37.040
Hi.

19:40.771 --> 19:46.983
Just, incidentally,
why are you wearing that?

19:47.678 --> 19:49.623
Combination of factors really.

19:50.481 --> 19:51.513
No clean clothes...

19:51.548 --> 19:55.359
There never will be, you know, unless
you actually clean your clothes.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.894
Vicious circle.
Yeah.

19:58.255 --> 20:02.760
And I was, like, rooting round in your things
and I found this and I thought, "Cool. "

20:04.328 --> 20:06.102
Kinda spacey.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.803
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.180
No, they were prescription.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.339
Groovy.

20:17.374 --> 20:18.909
So I could see all
the fishes properly.

20:19.443 --> 20:21.547
You should do
more of this stuff.

20:21.879 --> 20:23.534
So, look, any messages today?

20:23.569 --> 20:25.189
Yeah, I wrote a couple down.

20:26.483 --> 20:29.327
So there were two, there
were two messages? Right?

20:32.222 --> 20:34.759
You want me to write
down all your messages?

20:35.259 --> 20:39.400
Okay. Who are the ones that
you didn't write down from?

20:41.698 --> 20:43.098
No, gone completely.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.366
Oh, no, there was
one from your mum.

20:44.401 --> 20:47.437
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.712
No one else?
Absolutely no one else.

20:53.076 --> 20:56.680
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing- down-all-the-message thing,

20:56.715 --> 20:59.626
some American girl called
Anna called a few days ago.

21:05.822 --> 21:06.955
What did she say?

21:06.990 --> 21:08.524
Well, it was genuinely
bizarre.

21:08.559 --> 21:13.804
She said, "Hi, it's Anna. " Then
she said, "Call me at The Ritz. "

21:15.199 --> 21:18.043
And then gave herself
a completely different name.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.601
Which was?

21:19.636 --> 21:21.308
Absolutely no idea.

21:22.306 --> 21:24.239
Remembering one name's
hard enough.

21:24.274 --> 21:28.979
No, I know that. She said that.
I know she's using another name.

21:29.014 --> 21:32.282
The problem is she left
the message with my flatmate

21:32.317 --> 21:34.386
which was a very
serious mistake.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.855
Imagine, if you will, the
stupidest person you've ever met.

21:38.890 --> 21:40.622
Are you doing that?

21:40.657 --> 21:42.759
Yes, sir,
I have him in my mind.

21:42.794 --> 21:43.959
And now double it.

21:43.994 --> 21:48.943
And that is the, what can I say,
the git that I am living with.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.834
And he can't
remember this other...

21:50.869 --> 21:52.404
Try Flintstone.

21:53.303 --> 21:54.403
Sorry. What?

21:54.438 --> 21:56.440
I think she said
her name was Flintstone.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.981
I don't suppose Flintstone
rings any bells, does it?

22:04.016 --> 22:05.549
I'll put you right through,
sir.

22:05.584 --> 22:06.686
Oh, my God.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.732
Hello. Hi.

22:14.925 --> 22:15.994
Hi.

22:16.426 --> 22:20.237
Hi. Sorry.
It's William Thacker.

22:21.732 --> 22:24.075
Yes?
We... I work in a bookshop.

22:24.868 --> 22:28.070
You played it pretty cool there,
waiting for three days to call.

22:28.105 --> 22:31.661
Oh, no, I promise you I've never
played anything cool in my entire life.

22:31.696 --> 22:35.218
My flatmate, who I'll stab to death
later, never gave me the message.

22:37.047 --> 22:38.321
Perhaps

22:39.483 --> 22:42.429
I could drop round for
tea later or something?

22:43.020 --> 22:45.989
Things are pretty busy here.
I might be free around 4:00.

22:46.024 --> 22:48.264
Right. Right. Great.

22:50.193 --> 22:51.194
Bye.

22:57.367 --> 23:05.208
Classic.

23:44.181 --> 23:46.024
Which floor?
Three, please.

24:16.213 --> 24:17.512
Are you sure?

24:17.547 --> 24:19.856
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

24:31.928 --> 24:36.099
Hi. Hi. I'm Karen. I'm sorry,
things are running a little bit late.

24:36.134 --> 24:38.670
Here's the thing.
Do you wanna come this way?

24:40.937 --> 24:42.177
Through here.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.128
So what did you
think of the film?

24:49.163 --> 24:50.912
Yeah, I thought
it was fantastic.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.951
I thought it was Close
Encounters meets Jean de Florette.

24:58.255 --> 24:59.256
I agree.

25:00.557 --> 25:03.126
I'm sorry, I didn't get down
what magazines you're from.

25:03.161 --> 25:04.261
Time Out.

25:04.296 --> 25:05.362
Great.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.172
And you're from?

25:14.171 --> 25:15.581
Horse & Hound.

25:20.410 --> 25:23.947
The name's William Thacker.
Actually, she might be expecting me.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.450
Oh, okay. Take a seat
and I'll go check.

25:30.921 --> 25:34.024
I see you've... I see you've
brought her some flowers.

25:35.258 --> 25:39.137
No. These are
for my grandmother.

25:40.764 --> 25:42.931
She's in a hospital
down the road.

25:42.966 --> 25:45.569
Thought I'd kill two birds
with one stone, you know.

25:45.604 --> 25:47.480
Sure, right. Absolutely, yeah.

25:49.706 --> 25:51.310
Which hospital's that?

25:53.009 --> 25:56.313
Do you mind me not saying? It's a
rather distressing thing, isn't it?

25:56.348 --> 25:57.747
Name of the hospital
kind of gives it away.

25:57.782 --> 25:59.487
Absolutely. Sure.
Cheers.

26:01.585 --> 26:04.454
Right. Mr. Thacker,
if you come this way.

26:04.489 --> 26:05.489
Right.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.230
You've got five minutes.

26:18.668 --> 26:20.408
Hi.
Hello.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.251
I brought these,
but clearly...

26:26.042 --> 26:28.749
No, they're great.
They're great.

26:30.347 --> 26:32.115
I'm sorry about
not ringing back.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.382
The whole "two names" concept

26:34.417 --> 26:37.052
was totally too much for my
flatmate's pea-sized intellect.

26:37.087 --> 26:40.924
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
I always pick a cartoon character.

26:40.959 --> 26:43.267
Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.

26:47.030 --> 26:48.098
Everything all right?

26:48.133 --> 26:49.297
Yes, thank you.

26:49.332 --> 26:51.368
And you're from Horse & Hound?

26:53.069 --> 26:54.070
Good.

26:55.272 --> 26:56.409
Is that so?

27:04.080 --> 27:05.115
So,

27:10.520 --> 27:13.591
I'll just fire away,
then, shall I?

27:15.825 --> 27:16.928
Right.

27:21.164 --> 27:22.564
The film's great,

27:22.599 --> 27:26.274
and I just was
wondering whether

27:27.504 --> 27:33.750
you ever thought of having
more... horses in it?

27:38.248 --> 27:40.248
Well, we would have liked to,

27:40.283 --> 27:45.323
but it was difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

27:47.157 --> 27:50.137
Space, right, yeah. Yeah,
obviously very difficult.

27:52.362 --> 27:53.695
I'm so sorry.

27:53.730 --> 27:55.730
I arrived outside, they
thrust this thing into my hand.

27:55.765 --> 27:59.035
No, it's my fault. I thought
this would all be over by now.

27:59.070 --> 28:02.305
I just wanted to sort of
apologize for the kissing thing.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.406
I seriously don't know
what came over me.

28:04.441 --> 28:07.512
I just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.

28:09.813 --> 28:13.216
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
absolutely fine.

28:15.986 --> 28:19.222
Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project

28:19.257 --> 28:21.861
which she is shooting
later in the summer.

28:23.226 --> 28:25.797
Yes, excellent. Excellent.

28:31.901 --> 28:33.539
Any horses in that one?

28:35.338 --> 28:39.513
Or hounds for that matter? Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.623
It takes place on a submarine.

28:45.982 --> 28:47.290
Well, bad luck.

28:48.985 --> 28:53.456
But if there were horses in it

28:54.491 --> 29:00.703
would you be riding them or would you be
getting a stunt-horse-double-man-thing?

29:05.101 --> 29:08.013
I'm a complete moron.
I apologize.

29:08.938 --> 29:10.038
This is very weird.

29:10.073 --> 29:13.543
It's the sort of thing that
happens in dreams, not in real life.

29:14.144 --> 29:20.754
I mean, good dreams. It's a
dream, in fact, to see you again.

29:23.319 --> 29:25.321
What happens next
in the dream?

29:28.425 --> 29:34.030
I suppose that in the dream,
"dream scenario,"

29:34.065 --> 29:37.666
I just change my personality

29:37.701 --> 29:40.443
because you can
do that in dreams

29:43.873 --> 29:48.685
and walk over
and kiss the girl. But...

29:59.289 --> 30:02.167
Time's up, I'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.026
Nearly, nearly.

30:05.061 --> 30:06.938
Well, maybe just
one last question.

30:08.798 --> 30:10.365
Sure.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.503
Right, right.

30:14.804 --> 30:18.012
Are you busy tonight?

30:19.142 --> 30:20.542
Yes.

30:20.577 --> 30:22.351
Right. Right.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.218
Come in.

30:26.549 --> 30:29.152
Well, it was nice to meet you.

30:29.187 --> 30:30.358
Yes, and you.

30:31.221 --> 30:33.030
Surreal but nice.

30:34.491 --> 30:35.594
Thank you.

30:36.593 --> 30:39.096
You are Horse & Hound's
favorite actress.

30:40.530 --> 30:42.839
You and Black Beauty tied.

30:48.338 --> 30:50.681
Hang on, don't go.
How was she?

30:53.610 --> 30:55.487
Fabulous.
Excellent.

30:55.712 --> 30:58.658
Wait a minute, she took your
grandmother's flowers.

30:59.582 --> 31:03.427
Yeah, yeah.
That's right. Bitch.

31:03.853 --> 31:08.665
Mr. Thacker. If you'd like to come with
me we can just rush you through the others.

31:09.826 --> 31:10.925
The others?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.803
Mr. Thacker is
from Horse & Hound.

31:15.965 --> 31:17.465
How's it going?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.768
Very well. Thank you.

31:18.803 --> 31:19.939
Have a seat.

31:22.539 --> 31:24.450
Well, did you enjoy the film?

31:25.575 --> 31:27.884
Yes. Enormously.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.513
Well, fire away.
Right.

31:32.649 --> 31:34.584
Did you enjoy making the film?

31:34.619 --> 31:35.994
Yes, I did.

31:37.086 --> 31:38.087
Good.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.422
Any bit in particular?

31:41.457 --> 31:44.192
You tell me what
"bit" you enjoyed the most

31:44.227 --> 31:47.003
and I'll tell you if I
enjoyed making that "bit. "

31:51.534 --> 31:54.981
I... liked the bit in space.

31:56.606 --> 31:57.812
Very much.

31:59.475 --> 32:02.353
Did you identify with
the character you're playing?

32:06.015 --> 32:09.752
No.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.388
Oh.

32:14.190 --> 32:15.327
Why not?

32:22.232 --> 32:25.303
Because he's playing a
psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

32:25.902 --> 32:26.903
Classic.

32:28.705 --> 32:33.443
So, is this your first film?

32:33.478 --> 32:35.855
No, it's my 22nd.

32:36.112 --> 32:37.488
Of course it is.

32:38.681 --> 32:40.785
Any favorites among the 22?

32:41.918 --> 32:43.686
Working with Leonardo.

32:43.721 --> 32:44.857
Da Vinci?

32:46.723 --> 32:48.463
DiCaprio.
Of course.

32:51.527 --> 32:54.007
And is he your favorite
Italian director?

32:59.669 --> 33:01.705
Mr. Thacker?
Oh, no.

33:02.739 --> 33:04.650
Have you got a minute?
No.

33:11.648 --> 33:16.653
Hi.

33:21.591 --> 33:24.571
The thing I was doing tonight
I'm not doing anymore.

33:25.228 --> 33:27.965
I told them I had to
spend the evening with

33:28.000 --> 33:30.703
Britain's premiere
equestrian journalist.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.877
Well, great. Fantastic.

33:38.374 --> 33:42.412
Shittity brickity. It's
my sister's birthday. Shit.

33:42.447 --> 33:43.846
We're meant to
be having dinner.

33:43.881 --> 33:45.013
Okay, that's fine.

33:45.048 --> 33:46.848
No, I'm sure
I can get out of it.

33:46.883 --> 33:50.353
No, I mean, if it's fine
with you, I'll be your date.

33:52.088 --> 33:57.128
You'll be my date to my little
sister's birthday party?

33:58.394 --> 34:00.061
If it's all right.

34:00.096 --> 34:01.575
Well, yeah,
I'm sure it's all right.

34:02.098 --> 34:03.431
My friend Max is cooking

34:03.466 --> 34:07.072
and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world,

34:08.737 --> 34:11.407
but you could hide the food
in your handbag or something.

34:11.442 --> 34:14.284
Okay.

34:17.714 --> 34:19.203
He's bringing a girl?

34:19.237 --> 34:20.692
Miracles do happen.

34:21.818 --> 34:23.338
Does the girl have a name?

34:23.373 --> 34:24.858
Don't know, wouldn't say.

34:25.922 --> 34:28.324
Oh Christ,
what is going on in there?

34:29.692 --> 34:31.398
Oh, God!

34:34.397 --> 34:36.536
Hi, come on in.
Vague food crisis.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.405
Hiya.

34:44.440 --> 34:48.444
Sorry, the guinea-fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.

34:49.012 --> 34:50.313
He's cooking guinea-fowl?

34:50.348 --> 34:51.518
Don't even ask.

34:52.315 --> 34:53.315
Hi.
Hi.

34:54.984 --> 34:56.686
Good Lord, you're the
spitting image of...

34:56.721 --> 34:58.563
Bella, this is Anna.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.992
Right.
Okay, crisis over.

35:03.027 --> 35:04.402
Max, this is Anna.

35:05.862 --> 35:07.528
Hi.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.872
Hello, Anna... Scott.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.111
Have some wine.
Thank you.

35:14.837 --> 35:16.008
I'll get it.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.483
Red or white?

35:22.445 --> 35:23.480
Hi.
Hi.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.549
Oh yes, happy birthday.

35:26.584 --> 35:27.648
Thank you.

35:27.683 --> 35:30.319
Look, your brother's
brought this girl...

35:30.354 --> 35:31.695
Hi, guys.

35:32.121 --> 35:33.600
Holy fuck!

35:34.323 --> 35:38.134
Honey, this is Anna. Anna, this
is Honey. She's my baby sister.

35:39.662 --> 35:41.062
Hi.
Oh, God.

35:41.097 --> 35:44.599
This is one of those key moments
in life when it's possible

35:44.634 --> 35:51.278
you can be really genuinely cool
and I'm going to fail just 100%.

35:53.142 --> 35:57.590
I absolutely, totally
and utterly adore you.

35:58.081 --> 36:02.785
And I just think you are the
most beautiful woman in the world.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.520
And more importantly,
I genuinely believe,

36:05.555 --> 36:10.697
and I've believed for some time
now, that we could be best friends.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.632
So what do you think?

36:16.699 --> 36:17.700
Lucky me.

36:20.937 --> 36:22.470
Happy birthday.

36:22.505 --> 36:24.040
Oh, you gave me a present.

36:25.441 --> 36:27.442
We're best friends
already then.

36:27.477 --> 36:30.753
Marry Will, he's a really nice
guy, then we can be sisters.

36:31.214 --> 36:32.852
I'll think about it.

36:34.851 --> 36:36.261
That'll be Bernie.

36:38.588 --> 36:40.822
Hi.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

36:40.857 --> 36:43.064
Bollocksed up at work again,
I fear.

36:44.227 --> 36:45.394
Millions down the drain.

36:45.429 --> 36:46.429
Well done.

36:46.696 --> 36:47.995
Bernie, this is Anna.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.165
Hello, Anna.
Delighted to meet you.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.331
And you.

36:50.366 --> 36:53.711
Honey bunny,
happy birthday to you.

36:54.137 --> 36:55.809
Hi, Bella.
Hi.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.816
It's a hat. You don't have
to wear it or anything.

37:00.309 --> 37:02.288
Hi, Will.
Hi.

37:03.846 --> 37:04.847
Hi.

37:06.249 --> 37:07.750
Hi.
What?

37:09.085 --> 37:10.427
Wine, Bernie?

37:11.754 --> 37:13.121
You haven't slept with her,
have you?

37:13.156 --> 37:15.658
That is a cheap question and the
answer is, of course, no comment.

37:15.693 --> 37:17.525
No comment means "yes. "
No, it doesn't.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.495
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.264
You see, it means "yes. "

37:22.498 --> 37:26.571
So, tell me, Anna,
what do you do?

37:28.271 --> 37:30.307
I'm an actress.
Oh, splendid.

37:31.274 --> 37:32.673
What do you do?

37:32.708 --> 37:34.310
I'm actually in the
stock market myself.

37:34.345 --> 37:36.844
So...
not really similar fields.

37:36.879 --> 37:40.053
Though I have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.720
P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.

37:44.755 --> 37:46.422
"Careful there, vicar. "

37:48.691 --> 37:50.726
Always imagined it's a pretty
tough job, though, acting.

37:50.761 --> 37:53.129
I mean, the wages are
a scandal, aren't they?

37:53.164 --> 37:54.695
They can be.

37:54.730 --> 37:58.334
I see friends from university, clever
chaps, been in the business longer than you.

37:58.369 --> 38:02.077
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

38:03.439 --> 38:04.918
It's no life.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.944
What sort of acting do you do?

38:07.979 --> 38:09.923
Films mainly.

38:10.213 --> 38:14.559
Splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

38:16.452 --> 38:19.694
I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

38:20.590 --> 38:22.262
$15 million.

38:23.926 --> 38:24.927
Right.

38:26.062 --> 38:29.118
So that's... well, fairly good.

38:29.153 --> 38:32.175
Right, I think we're ready.

38:33.869 --> 38:35.836
Bella, can you tell me
where I can find...

38:35.871 --> 38:38.474
Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. It's
down the corridor on the right.

38:38.509 --> 38:40.385
I'll show you. I'll show you.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.781
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
Talk very quickly.

38:45.816 --> 38:47.648
What are you doing
here with Anna Scott?

38:47.683 --> 38:50.486
Anna Scott? What, the
film star? Yes. Shut up.

38:50.521 --> 38:51.786
Shh.

38:51.821 --> 38:53.800
Oh, God!
What?

38:54.257 --> 38:55.875
Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.

38:55.910 --> 38:57.458
What did you say to her?

38:57.493 --> 39:00.896
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

39:00.931 --> 39:03.499
I was still chatting when she
started unbuttoning her jeans.

39:03.534 --> 39:04.900
She had to ask me to leave.

39:04.935 --> 39:06.033
Oh, God.

39:06.068 --> 39:07.935
So you knew who she was?

39:07.970 --> 39:09.972
Of course I did,
but he didn't!

39:10.840 --> 39:14.651
Well, not instantly,
but I got away with it though.

39:17.913 --> 39:20.188
What do you think
of the guinea-fowl?

39:20.783 --> 39:22.251
I'm a vegetarian.

39:22.286 --> 39:23.422
Oh, God.

39:25.421 --> 39:27.161
So, how's the guinea-fowl?

39:28.791 --> 39:30.964
Best guinea-fowl
I've ever tasted.

40:05.528 --> 40:09.165
Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what I've long suspected,

40:09.200 --> 40:12.201
that we really are the most
desperate lot of under-achievers.

40:12.236 --> 40:13.334
Shame.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.036
I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

40:15.071 --> 40:18.211
In fact, I think it's something
we should take pride in.

40:19.041 --> 40:23.717
I'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize to the saddest act here.

40:25.581 --> 40:26.649
Bern.

40:28.584 --> 40:30.084
Well, obviously
it's me, isn't it?

40:30.119 --> 40:33.556
I mean, I work in the city
in a job I don't understand

40:33.591 --> 40:36.123
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

40:36.158 --> 40:39.128
I haven't had a girlfriend
since, well, since puberty.

40:39.163 --> 40:41.835
And nobody fancies me.

40:42.431 --> 40:44.433
And if these cheeks get
any chubbier, they never will.

40:44.468 --> 40:46.412
Nonsense. I fancy you.

40:47.703 --> 40:49.079
Really?
Yeah.

40:49.638 --> 40:51.407
Or I did before
you got so fat.

40:51.442 --> 40:52.506
You see.

40:52.541 --> 40:56.712
And unless I'm much mistaken your job
still pays you rather a lot of money

40:56.747 --> 40:58.913
whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week

40:58.948 --> 41:01.283
flogging her guts out in
London's worst record store.

41:01.318 --> 41:02.583
Yes!

41:02.618 --> 41:05.286
And I haven't got hair,
I've got feathers.

41:05.321 --> 41:09.166
And I've got funny goggly eyes
and I'm attracted to cruel men.

41:10.025 --> 41:14.897
Actually, no one will marry me because my
boosies have actually started shrinking.

41:14.932 --> 41:16.630
You see,
it's incredibly sad.

41:16.665 --> 41:19.401
Yeah, but on the other hand
her best friend is Anna Scott.

41:19.436 --> 41:22.138
That's true, I can't deny it.
She needs me. What can I say?

41:24.373 --> 41:27.943
And most of her limbs work whereas
I'm stuck in this thing day and night,

41:27.978 --> 41:29.683
in a house full of ramps.

41:29.912 --> 41:32.085
And to add insult
to serious injury

41:33.582 --> 41:36.824
I've totally given up smoking,
my favorite thing.

41:40.489 --> 41:43.834
Well, the truth is,
we can't have a baby.

41:50.666 --> 41:51.837
Oh, Belle...

41:53.536 --> 41:55.015
C'est la vie.

41:58.574 --> 42:01.145
Still, we're lucky
in lots of ways.

42:02.044 --> 42:04.217
But, surely that's
worth a brownie.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.150
Well, I don't know.

42:09.618 --> 42:10.994
Look at William.

42:12.121 --> 42:13.522
Very unsuccessful
professionally.

42:13.557 --> 42:14.641
That's true.

42:14.676 --> 42:15.726
Divorced.

42:16.592 --> 42:19.829
Used to be handsome, now kind
of squidgy round the edges.

42:21.263 --> 42:23.901
And absolutely certain
never to hear from Anna again

42:23.936 --> 42:26.539
once she's heard that his
nickname at school was Floppy.

42:27.136 --> 42:29.411
You did. I can't believe it,
you did.

42:30.439 --> 42:32.139
Thanks very much. Thank you.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.809
Well at least I get
the last brownie, right?

42:33.844 --> 42:35.075
I think so, yes.

42:35.110 --> 42:36.850
Well, wait, what about me?

42:39.381 --> 42:40.484
I'm sorry?

42:41.650 --> 42:43.789
You think you deserve
the brownie?

42:45.421 --> 42:47.039
Well, a shot at it at least,
huh?

42:47.074 --> 42:48.622
Right, well,
you'll have to prove it.

42:48.657 --> 42:52.434
I mean, this is a very, very good
brownie and I'm gonna fight for it.

42:53.596 --> 42:56.474
I've been on a diet
every day since I was 19

42:56.966 --> 43:00.208
which basically means
I've been hungry for a decade.

43:02.004 --> 43:06.008
I've had a series of not nice
boyfriends, one of whom hit me.

43:07.610 --> 43:09.143
And every time
I get my heart broken,

43:09.178 --> 43:14.024
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

43:15.417 --> 43:22.300
And it's taken two rather painful
operations to get me looking like this.

43:22.925 --> 43:24.768
Really?
Really.

43:28.464 --> 43:31.206
And one day, not long from now

43:31.800 --> 43:35.475
my looks will go,
they will discover I can't act

43:36.272 --> 43:41.153
and I will become some sad,
middle-aged woman who

43:42.411 --> 43:45.323
looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

43:54.023 --> 43:56.926
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

43:58.928 --> 44:01.101
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

44:02.865 --> 44:04.633
Thank you for such
a terrific time.

44:04.668 --> 44:05.770
I'm delighted.

44:07.870 --> 44:09.091
That's a great tie.

44:09.126 --> 44:10.312
Now you're lying.

44:10.573 --> 44:12.841
Okay, it's true. I told you
I was bad at acting.

44:12.876 --> 44:14.043
It was lovely to meet you.

44:14.078 --> 44:15.309
Yeah. And you.

44:15.344 --> 44:18.647
I'll wait until you've gone before
I tell him you're a vegetarian.

44:18.682 --> 44:19.648
No!

44:23.552 --> 44:24.752
Goodnight.

44:24.787 --> 44:26.627
I'm sorry about the loo thing.

44:26.662 --> 44:28.467
I meant to leave but I just...

44:29.358 --> 44:31.327
Look, ring me if you want
someone to go shopping with.

44:31.362 --> 44:32.993
I know lots of nice,
cheap places.

44:33.028 --> 44:35.440
I mean, not that
money is necessarily...

44:35.598 --> 44:37.032
It was just so
nice to meet you.

44:37.067 --> 44:38.300
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

44:38.335 --> 44:39.938
You're my style guru.

44:40.336 --> 44:41.837
Sorry, can I just...

44:43.505 --> 44:44.772
Leave her.

44:44.807 --> 44:46.115
Goodnight, everyone.

44:46.442 --> 44:49.081
Max, Belle, we'll see
you in a couple of days.

44:50.779 --> 44:52.952
Bye, guys.
Bye, Anna.

44:53.949 --> 44:55.249
Love your work.

44:55.284 --> 44:56.888
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

45:04.727 --> 45:07.863
Sorry. They always do that
when I leave the house.

45:07.898 --> 45:11.208
It's a stupid thing.
I hate it.

45:21.977 --> 45:23.477
Floppy, huh?

45:23.512 --> 45:25.355
It's the hair.
It's to do with the hair.

45:29.351 --> 45:31.160
Why is she in a wheelchair?

45:32.287 --> 45:35.859
Because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

45:36.859 --> 45:39.828
And the pregnancy thing, is
that to do with the accident?

45:39.863 --> 45:40.861
You know, I'm not sure.

45:40.896 --> 45:44.434
I don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.

45:53.175 --> 45:54.551
Do you want to...

45:56.545 --> 45:58.024
My place is just...

45:59.381 --> 46:00.757
Too complicated.

46:01.684 --> 46:02.890
That's fine.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.434
Busy tomorrow?

46:13.162 --> 46:14.663
I thought you were
leaving tomorrow.

46:14.698 --> 46:15.732
I was.

46:19.435 --> 46:20.634
All these streets round here

46:20.669 --> 46:23.605
have these mysterious communal
gardens in the middle of them.

46:23.640 --> 46:24.940
They're like little villages.

46:24.975 --> 46:26.146
Let's go in.

46:26.508 --> 46:28.709
No, that's the point.
They're private villages.

46:28.744 --> 46:31.884
Only the people who live round
the edges are allowed in.

46:32.881 --> 46:35.167
You abide by rules like that?

46:35.202 --> 46:37.453
I don't, no, no,
but others do.

46:37.488 --> 46:39.193
And I just do what I want.

46:42.491 --> 46:43.492
Right.

46:46.395 --> 46:47.863
Whoopsidaisies.

46:49.631 --> 46:51.269
What did you say?

46:52.434 --> 46:54.106
Nothing.
Yes, you did.

46:55.370 --> 46:56.403
No, I didn't.

46:56.438 --> 46:58.144
You said "whoopsidaisies. "

46:58.841 --> 47:01.477
No one says "whoopsidaisies," do
they? I mean, unless they're...

47:01.512 --> 47:02.509
There is no "unless. "

47:02.544 --> 47:04.978
Because no one has said
"whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.

47:05.013 --> 47:09.451
And even then it was just little
girls with blonde ringlets.

47:09.486 --> 47:11.225
Exactly. Right.

47:12.521 --> 47:14.089
So here we go again.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.993
Whoopsidaisies.

47:20.295 --> 47:22.362
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
It's a clinical thing.

47:22.397 --> 47:26.068
I'm taking pills and having injections.
And I'm told it won't last long so...

47:26.103 --> 47:27.601
Okay, stand aside.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.115
I don't think
that's a good idea.

47:29.938 --> 47:32.714
Really, it's quite tricky.
Anna.

47:34.309 --> 47:37.984
Anna, don't, it's harder than
it... No, it's not. It's easy.

47:46.822 --> 47:48.198
Come on, Flopsy.

47:49.391 --> 47:51.427
Right. Right!

47:55.631 --> 47:56.871
Oh, bugger.

47:58.467 --> 48:00.776
Oh, God. This could
be very unpleasant.

48:06.608 --> 48:07.984
Bugger, bugger.

48:12.481 --> 48:16.394
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile?

48:31.366 --> 48:32.640
Nice garden.

49:05.567 --> 49:11.449
"For June who loved this garden, from
Joseph who always sat beside her. "

49:16.245 --> 49:18.987
Some people do spend
their whole lives together.

49:53.582 --> 49:55.117
Come and sit with me.

50:08.497 --> 50:10.515
Bollocks. Bollocks. Bollocks!

50:10.550 --> 50:12.534
Have you seen my glasses?

50:12.569 --> 50:14.437
No, afraid not.

50:14.472 --> 50:16.270
Big, big bollocks!

50:16.305 --> 50:20.108
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.
Everywhere I look there's a pair of glasses.

50:20.143 --> 50:22.311
But when I want to go to
the cinema they've vanished.

50:22.346 --> 50:24.311
It's one of life's
real cruelties.

50:24.346 --> 50:28.760
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in
the Far East or testicular cancer, is it?

50:29.251 --> 50:31.060
Oh, shit, is that the time?

50:32.988 --> 50:35.090
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.

50:35.125 --> 50:37.426
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you find them?

50:37.461 --> 50:39.405
Sort of.
Great.

51:09.725 --> 51:11.430
So who left who?

51:11.465 --> 51:13.135
She left me.

51:13.662 --> 51:14.663
Why?

51:15.764 --> 51:17.637
She saw through me.

51:17.672 --> 51:19.510
That's not good.

51:20.902 --> 51:23.075
You can give me
Anna Scott any day.

51:23.939 --> 51:26.808
I didn't like her last film. Fell
asleep as soon as the lights went down.

51:26.843 --> 51:29.295
I don't really care
what the film's like.

51:29.330 --> 51:31.747
Any film with her in,
it's fine by me.

51:33.148 --> 51:35.817
She's not my type at
all. I prefer that other one.

51:35.852 --> 51:38.160
You know, blonde,
sweet looking.

51:39.121 --> 51:40.220
You know, what's her name?

51:40.255 --> 51:43.125
Has an orgasm every time you
take her out for a cup of coffee.

51:43.160 --> 51:44.365
Meg Ryan.

51:45.093 --> 51:46.393
No, she's too wholesome.

51:46.428 --> 51:50.398
You see, the point about Miss Scott
is she's got that twinkle in her eye.

51:51.600 --> 51:54.403
Probably drug-induced. Spends
most of her life in bloody rehab.

51:54.438 --> 51:56.937
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up for it.

51:56.972 --> 52:00.510
I mean, you see, most girls,
they're all like, "Stay away, chum. "

52:01.143 --> 52:04.214
She is absolutely
gagging for it.

52:05.714 --> 52:08.548
Do you know that
in over 50% of languages

52:08.583 --> 52:11.787
the word for "actress" is the
same as the word for "prostitute"?

52:11.822 --> 52:14.222
Where did you
get that from?

52:15.924 --> 52:19.166
And Anna is your
definitive actress,

52:20.162 --> 52:23.666
someone really filthy you can
just flip over and start again.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.900
Right, that's it. Sorry.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.005
No, no.
There's really no point.

52:32.541 --> 52:34.709
Sorry, sorry to disturb
you guys but...

52:34.744 --> 52:36.543
Can I help?
Well, yeah.

52:36.578 --> 52:39.713
I wish I hadn't overheard your
conversation, but I did.

52:39.748 --> 52:45.087
And, I just think, you know the person
you're talking about is a real person

52:45.122 --> 52:48.156
and I think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration

52:48.191 --> 52:51.760
rather than having jerks
like you drooling over her.

52:51.795 --> 52:54.740
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad?

53:01.937 --> 53:04.104
I'm sorry.
No, I love that you tried.

53:04.139 --> 53:06.983
Time was I'd have done
the same thing. In fact...

53:13.215 --> 53:14.216
Hi.

53:15.350 --> 53:16.760
Oh, my God!

53:17.085 --> 53:20.555
I just wanted to apologize for
my friend. He's very sensitive.

53:21.289 --> 53:24.693
No, no, no, leave it. I'm
sure you didn't mean any harm.

53:24.728 --> 53:27.127
I'm sure it was
just friendly banter.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.464
I'm sure you guys have
dicks the size of peanuts.

53:29.499 --> 53:31.967
Enjoy your dinner.
The tuna's really good.

53:35.437 --> 53:39.007
I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.

53:39.042 --> 53:40.528
No, you were brilliant.

53:40.563 --> 53:42.015
I'm rash and I am stupid.

53:43.378 --> 53:45.152
What am I doing with you?

53:45.914 --> 53:47.620
I don't know, I'm afraid.

53:48.450 --> 53:49.758
I don't either.

53:54.689 --> 53:55.860
Here we are.

53:56.958 --> 53:57.959
Yes.

54:01.129 --> 54:02.801
Do you wanna come up?

54:05.734 --> 54:10.338
Well, there seems to be lots of
reasons why I shouldn't, so...

54:10.373 --> 54:12.181
There are lots of reasons.

54:16.745 --> 54:18.280
Do you wanna come up?

54:23.385 --> 54:24.920
Give me five minutes?

54:42.771 --> 54:43.874
Hi.
Hi.

54:47.776 --> 54:50.245
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.349
You've got to go.
Why?

54:53.081 --> 54:57.719
Because my boyfriend, who was in America,
is, in fact, now in the next room.

54:57.754 --> 54:59.119
Boyfriend?
Yes.

54:59.154 --> 55:00.755
Hey, baby, who is it?

55:00.790 --> 55:01.824
It's...

55:06.528 --> 55:07.768
Room service.

55:08.763 --> 55:09.796
How are you doing?

55:09.831 --> 55:12.709
I thought you guys always
wore those penguin coats?

55:13.702 --> 55:14.976
Usually we do.

55:15.570 --> 55:17.709
But I was just
changed to go home.

55:18.607 --> 55:22.077
And then I thought
I'd take this final call.

55:23.278 --> 55:25.580
Oh, great. If you don't mind,
I would like something, too.

55:25.615 --> 55:28.560
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water?

55:29.484 --> 55:30.935
I'll see what I can do.

55:30.970 --> 55:32.387
Still, not sparkling.

55:32.854 --> 55:34.621
Absolutely.
Ice-cold still water.

55:34.656 --> 55:36.741
Unless, of course,
it's illegal in the UK

55:36.776 --> 55:38.792
to serve beverages
below room temperature.

55:38.827 --> 55:41.796
I wouldn't want you going to
jail just to satisfy my whim, now.

55:41.831 --> 55:43.798
I'm sure it's fine.
Thank you.

55:45.367 --> 55:47.300
Hey, one more thing,
if you don't mind,

55:47.335 --> 55:50.805
could you adiÃ³s these dirty dishes
and take out that trash, too?

55:53.775 --> 55:54.941
Right.

55:54.976 --> 55:57.277
No. No. Don't do that.

55:57.312 --> 55:59.846
I don't think it's
his job to clear.

55:59.881 --> 56:03.157
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's your name, man?

56:05.954 --> 56:07.153
Bernie.

56:07.188 --> 56:11.534
Oh, listen, Bernie, thank you,
I really appreciate it.

56:12.260 --> 56:13.495
Hey, you...

56:19.200 --> 56:23.443
So, tell me, tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise?

56:25.006 --> 56:26.072
Good surprise.

56:26.107 --> 56:28.343
Oh, you're such a liar.
She hates surprises.

56:28.378 --> 56:30.288
Hey, what are you gonna order?

56:30.845 --> 56:33.018
From him.
What are you gonna order?

56:34.049 --> 56:35.405
I haven't decided yet.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.761
Well, don't overdo it.

56:37.352 --> 56:38.418
I don't want people saying,

56:38.453 --> 56:41.729
"There goes that famous actor
with the big fat girlfriend. "

56:43.825 --> 56:45.133
I should leave.

56:52.434 --> 56:55.278
This is a fairly strange
reality to be faced with.

56:56.871 --> 56:58.179
I'm so sorry.

57:01.976 --> 57:04.922
I don't know what to say.

57:09.084 --> 57:12.429
I think "goodbye"
is traditional.

59:16.978 --> 59:20.186
Come on. Open up.

59:22.083 --> 59:23.323
This is me.

59:24.719 --> 59:26.054
Spikey.

59:27.288 --> 59:31.600
I'm in contact with some quite
important spiritual vibrations.

59:33.361 --> 59:36.706
Come on. Hit me with it.

59:40.835 --> 59:42.245
There's this girl.

59:43.905 --> 59:47.284
See, I'd been getting
a female vibe. Good.

59:48.076 --> 59:49.680
Speak on, dear friend.

59:50.445 --> 59:54.222
She's someone
who can't be mine,

59:58.419 --> 01:00:02.492
and it's as if I've taken "love heroin"
and now I can't ever have it again.

01:00:03.858 --> 01:00:07.134
I've opened Pandora's Box and
there's this trouble inside.

01:00:11.199 --> 01:00:12.200
Yeah.

01:00:13.835 --> 01:00:17.410
Tricky.

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:23.349
I knew a girl at school
called Pandora.

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:28.624
Never got to see
her box though.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:31.589
Right.

01:00:32.287 --> 01:00:34.824
Right, thanks,
that's very helpful.

01:00:37.058 --> 01:00:39.595
You didn't know
she had a boyfriend?

01:00:40.895 --> 01:00:44.706
No. No. Why, did you?

01:00:46.467 --> 01:00:48.640
Oh, bloody hell,
I don't believe it.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.907
My whole life ruined because
I don't read Hello! Magazine.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:57.480
Let's face facts. This was
always a no-win situation.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.887
Anna's a goddess.

01:01:01.649 --> 01:01:04.629
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

01:01:04.819 --> 01:01:06.054
Buggered, is it?

01:01:06.089 --> 01:01:07.487
Every time.

01:01:07.522 --> 01:01:11.526
But don't despair, I think I have
the solution to your problems.

01:01:12.193 --> 01:01:13.433
Really?

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:16.765
Her name is Tessa, and she works
in the contracts department.

01:01:16.898 --> 01:01:20.400
The hair, I admit,
is unfashionably frizzy.

01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:24.906
But she's bright as a button, and
kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.

01:01:24.941 --> 01:01:26.282
Apparently.

01:01:29.243 --> 01:01:30.744
Now, try.

01:01:34.882 --> 01:01:38.453
I got completely lost.
It's real difficult, isn't it?

01:01:38.488 --> 01:01:40.289
Everything's got the
word Kensington in it.

01:01:40.324 --> 01:01:42.090
Kensington Park Road.
Kensington Gardens.

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.556
Kensington bloody
Park Gardens.

01:01:43.591 --> 01:01:45.093
Look, Tessa,
this is Bella, my wife.

01:01:45.128 --> 01:01:47.228
Hello. You're in a wheelchair.

01:01:47.263 --> 01:01:49.030
Yeah, that's right.

01:01:49.065 --> 01:01:51.001
And this is William.

01:01:51.036 --> 01:01:52.937
Hello, William.
Hi.

01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:54.875
Max has told me
everything about you.

01:01:55.203 --> 01:01:56.302
Has he?

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:58.339
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

01:01:58.773 --> 01:02:00.946
Wine?
Oh, yes, please.

01:02:01.409 --> 01:02:03.344
Come on, Willie,
let's get sloshed.

01:02:03.379 --> 01:02:04.545
Red or white?

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.751
Red.

01:02:08.216 --> 01:02:09.524
Keziah...

01:02:11.486 --> 01:02:13.019
Some woodcock?

01:02:13.054 --> 01:02:15.431
No, thank you,
I'm a fruitarian.

01:02:19.727 --> 01:02:22.139
What is a fruitarian exactly?

01:02:22.263 --> 01:02:27.712
Well, we believe that fruits and vegetables
have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel.

01:02:28.436 --> 01:02:32.540
We only eat things that have
actually fallen from the tree or bush.

01:02:32.575 --> 01:02:34.883
That are, in fact,
dead already.

01:02:38.813 --> 01:02:40.189
Oh, right.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.053
Right.

01:02:42.984 --> 01:02:45.019
So, these carrots...

01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:47.055
Have been murdered, yes.

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.363
Murdered?

01:02:49.824 --> 01:02:53.499
Gosh, poor old carrots.
That's beastly.

01:02:57.832 --> 01:02:59.470
Delicious coffee.

01:03:00.968 --> 01:03:02.970
I'm sorry about the lamb.

01:03:03.471 --> 01:03:07.612
No, I thought it was really,
you know, interesting.

01:03:08.342 --> 01:03:10.651
"Interesting" means
"inedible. "

01:03:11.512 --> 01:03:14.015
Really inedible,
yes, you're right.

01:03:17.652 --> 01:03:20.826
Well, maybe we'll meet again.

01:03:21.556 --> 01:03:25.970
Yeah. Yeah. That'll be great.

01:03:34.969 --> 01:03:36.072
Bye.

01:03:56.023 --> 01:03:57.160
Well?

01:03:58.259 --> 01:04:01.330
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.035
And?

01:04:07.902 --> 01:04:12.373
You see, I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

01:04:14.008 --> 01:04:16.420
To find someone
you actually love,

01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:20.651
who'll love you, I mean, the
chances are always minuscule.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:26.152
Look at me.
Apart from the American,

01:04:26.187 --> 01:04:28.690
I've only loved two girls,
both total disasters.

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.356
That's not fair.
No, really.

01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:34.695
One of them marries me then leaves me
faster than you can say "Indiana Jones. "

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:38.166
And the other, who seriously
ought to have known better,

01:04:38.201 --> 01:04:40.368
casually marries
my best friend.

01:04:40.403 --> 01:04:41.667
She still loves you though.

01:04:41.702 --> 01:04:44.239
Yeah, in a depressingly
asexual way.

01:04:46.474 --> 01:04:49.076
I never fancied
you much, actually.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.418
Oh, God.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:57.829
I loved you, you were terribly
funny, but all that kissing my ears...

01:04:58.386 --> 01:05:00.853
I don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

01:05:00.888 --> 01:05:05.029
I shall find myself 30 years from
now still sitting on this sofa.

01:05:05.593 --> 01:05:07.445
Do you wanna stay?

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.262
Yeah, why not.

01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:12.767
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

01:05:15.837 --> 01:05:17.247
Here we go.

01:05:18.773 --> 01:05:19.925
Goodnight.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.077
Night.

01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:40.432
See you, Will.

01:05:40.467 --> 01:05:41.738
Right. Right.

01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:52.340
Guilty. Very, very guilty.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.012
So it seems.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.124
Hi.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.395
Can I come in?

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.035
Come in.

01:06:57.405 --> 01:07:00.608
They were taken years ago.

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:02.246
I know it was...

01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:07.286
But I was poor
and it happens a lot.

01:07:08.249 --> 01:07:10.592
That's not an excuse.
I just...

01:07:13.354 --> 01:07:18.633
But to make matters worse,
it now appears as though

01:07:20.027 --> 01:07:23.963
someone was filming
me as well.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:29.812
So what was a stupid photo
shoot now looks like a porn film.

01:07:32.239 --> 01:07:37.120
And the pictures have been sold,
and they're just everywhere.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.051
I didn't know where to go.

01:07:45.753 --> 01:07:47.698
The hotel's surrounded.

01:07:51.826 --> 01:07:54.067
I know it's been months but...

01:07:55.229 --> 01:07:56.935
This is the place.

01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:01.343
Thank you.

01:08:05.673 --> 01:08:11.054
I'm just in London for two
days, but what with your papers,

01:08:11.178 --> 01:08:13.282
it's the worst place to be.

01:08:13.981 --> 01:08:17.984
I mean, these pictures are just
so horrible and they're so grainy.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.892
And it makes me look like...

01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:21.765
Listen, don't think about it.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.897
We'll sort it out.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:31.432
Now what would you like?

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:34.606
Tea? Bath?

01:08:36.037 --> 01:08:37.140
Yeah.

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.952
A bath would be great.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.051
Oh, Christ alive!

01:08:51.986 --> 01:08:54.466
Brilliant. Fantastic.

01:08:57.224 --> 01:08:58.930
Magnificent.

01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:08.840
You must be Spike.

01:09:22.483 --> 01:09:23.484
Hi.

01:09:23.884 --> 01:09:26.091
Just checking.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.060
Thank you, God.

01:09:37.997 --> 01:09:40.444
I'm really sorry
about last time.

01:09:41.602 --> 01:09:44.344
I mean, he just flew in.
I had no idea.

01:09:45.406 --> 01:09:48.978
In fact, I had no idea if he
was ever gonna fly in again.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.729
Listen, it's not often
one has the opportunity to

01:09:52.765 --> 01:09:55.483
adiÃ³s the plates of
a major Hollywood film star.

01:09:55.518 --> 01:09:58.225
It was thrilling for me.

01:10:02.123 --> 01:10:03.624
So how is he?

01:10:06.093 --> 01:10:07.537
I don't know.

01:10:11.065 --> 01:10:13.067
It just got to the point
where I couldn't remember

01:10:13.102 --> 01:10:15.809
any of the reasons
why we were together.

01:10:17.638 --> 01:10:19.310
And you and love?

01:10:22.309 --> 01:10:26.916
Oh, well, there's a question
without an interesting answer.

01:10:32.786 --> 01:10:34.822
I have thought about you.

01:10:38.425 --> 01:10:42.863
It's just that any time
I've tried to keep

01:10:42.898 --> 01:10:47.301
anything normal
with a person that was normal,

01:10:47.336 --> 01:10:49.235
it's just been a disaster.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:52.376
Yeah, no, listen,
I appreciate that, absolutely.

01:10:53.774 --> 01:10:56.379
So what is that,
a film you're doing?

01:10:57.278 --> 01:10:59.382
I start in LA on Tuesday.

01:11:00.581 --> 01:11:03.717
Would you like me to
take you through your lines?

01:11:03.752 --> 01:11:06.854
Would you? Because it's
all talk, talk, talk.

01:11:07.121 --> 01:11:11.069
Come on, hand it over. Right.

01:11:12.526 --> 01:11:13.902
Basic plot?

01:11:14.361 --> 01:11:18.599
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
officer, who in about 20 minutes

01:11:18.634 --> 01:11:21.602
is gonna save the world
from nuclear disaster.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:24.103
Okay, well done, you.

01:11:24.138 --> 01:11:26.440
"Message from Command, would you
like them to send in the HK's?"

01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:28.307
No. Turn over four TRS's

01:11:28.342 --> 01:11:32.213
and tell them we need radar feedback
before the KFT's return at 19:00.

01:11:32.248 --> 01:11:34.248
Then inform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover

01:11:34.283 --> 01:11:35.817
from 10:00 through 12: 15.

01:11:35.852 --> 01:11:37.316
And if you say one word about

01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:39.687
how many mistakes I made in that
speech, I'll pelt you with olives.

01:11:39.722 --> 01:11:41.589
"Very well, Captain, I'll
pass that on, straight away. "

01:11:41.624 --> 01:11:43.791
Thank you.
How many mistakes did I make?

01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:44.792
Eleven.

01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:46.927
Dammit. And, Wainwright...

01:11:46.962 --> 01:11:48.661
Cartwright.

01:11:48.696 --> 01:11:51.230
Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is...

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.299
I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday,

01:11:53.334 --> 01:11:55.769
so could you get a message to
him that I may be a little late?

01:11:55.804 --> 01:11:58.339
"Certainly. "
And little Johnny?

01:11:58.374 --> 01:12:00.839
My son's name is Johnny?
Yeah.

01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:02.541
Well, then get
a message to him, too.

01:12:02.576 --> 01:12:05.412
"I'll do what I can, Captain,
but I can't promise anything. "

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:07.391
And, Cartwright goes.

01:12:09.917 --> 01:12:11.050
What do you think?

01:12:11.085 --> 01:12:14.058
Gripping. You know,
it's not Jane Austen.

01:12:14.093 --> 01:12:17.031
It's not Henry James.
But it's gripping.

01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:19.225
Think I should do
Henry James instead?

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.028
Well, I think you would be
brilliant in Henry James

01:12:21.063 --> 01:12:24.531
but, you know,
this writer... Writers...

01:12:24.566 --> 01:12:26.398
They're pretty damn good, too.

01:12:26.433 --> 01:12:29.069
Well, you never get anyone
in Wings of the Dove saying,

01:12:29.104 --> 01:12:31.974
"Inform the Pentagon,
we need Black Star cover. "

01:12:32.009 --> 01:12:34.845
Well, and for me,
the book is the poorer for it.

01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:41.785
I can't believe you
have that picture.

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:44.922
You like Chagall?

01:12:45.853 --> 01:12:46.990
I do.

01:12:48.589 --> 01:12:50.724
It feels like how
love should be.

01:12:50.759 --> 01:12:52.860
Floating through
a dark blue sky.

01:12:53.727 --> 01:12:56.764
With a goat, playing a violin.

01:12:56.799 --> 01:12:58.097
Well, yes.

01:12:58.132 --> 01:13:01.670
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

01:13:22.956 --> 01:13:24.628
You have big feet.

01:13:26.827 --> 01:13:30.638
Yes. Yes, always have had.

01:13:32.933 --> 01:13:36.039
You know what they say
about men with big feet?

01:13:37.905 --> 01:13:40.146
No, I don't know. What's that?

01:13:41.675 --> 01:13:46.146
Big feet, large shoes.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.653
The thing that's so
irritating is that now

01:13:54.688 --> 01:13:57.607
I'm so totally fierce when
it comes to nudity clauses.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:00.527
You actually have clauses
in your contract about nudity?

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:02.061
Definitely.

01:14:02.096 --> 01:14:06.868
You may show the dent of the top of
the artist's buttocks but neither cheek.

01:14:06.903 --> 01:14:11.640
Or, if there's a stunt bottom being
used, artist must have full consultation.

01:14:12.773 --> 01:14:13.972
You have a stunt bottom?

01:14:14.007 --> 01:14:17.113
Well, I could have
a stunt bottom, yes.

01:14:18.312 --> 01:14:21.782
And are people tempted to go for
better bottoms than their own.

01:14:21.817 --> 01:14:25.050
Yeah. I mean, I would.
This is important stuff.

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:29.156
Well, it's one hell of a job, isn't it?
I mean, what do you put on your passport?

01:14:29.191 --> 01:14:31.499
Profession.
Mel Gibson's bottom.

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:33.894
Actually, Mel does
his own ass work.

01:14:33.929 --> 01:14:34.927
Right.

01:14:34.962 --> 01:14:36.397
Why wouldn't he?

01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:37.534
Absolutely.

01:14:38.365 --> 01:14:39.935
It's delicious.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:43.570
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom?

01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:46.271
Both. Equally.

01:14:46.306 --> 01:14:49.076
But you wouldn't
necessarily lick both?

01:14:49.111 --> 01:14:50.816
Well, this is tart.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.915
And fuzz free.

01:14:59.987 --> 01:15:04.299
And... The bedroom,
I've put clean sheets on.

01:15:15.035 --> 01:15:17.014
Today's been a good day.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:21.711
Which in the circumstances
is unexpected.

01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:24.752
Thank you.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:33.286
Anyway, time for bed.

01:15:35.889 --> 01:15:37.732
Or, sofa bed.

01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:46.635
Goodnight.

01:16:33.647 --> 01:16:35.057
Oh, my God.

01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:45.162
Hello?

01:16:47.227 --> 01:16:48.433
Hello.

01:16:49.496 --> 01:16:50.662
Spike?

01:16:50.697 --> 01:16:53.939
I wonder if I could
have a little word?

01:16:54.101 --> 01:16:55.133
Right.

01:16:55.168 --> 01:16:56.535
I don't want to
interfere or nothing,

01:16:56.570 --> 01:17:00.207
but she's just split up from her
boyfriend. That's right, innit?

01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:01.378
Maybe.

01:17:01.708 --> 01:17:03.687
And she's in your house.

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:05.981
Yes?

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.483
And you get on very well.

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:11.084
Yes.

01:17:11.818 --> 01:17:15.163
Well, isn't this perhaps
a nice opportunity to

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.792
slip her one?

01:17:20.827 --> 01:17:21.962
Spike, for God's sake.
She's in trouble.

01:17:21.997 --> 01:17:23.061
Just get a grip.

01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:26.406
Right, you think it's the
wrong moment, fair enough.

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:32.039
Do you mind if I have a go?

01:17:32.074 --> 01:17:33.916
Spike!
Right, okay.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.012
I'll talk to you
in the morning.

01:17:37.047 --> 01:17:39.416
Okay. Might be too late,
but okay.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.410
Please, sod off.

01:17:53.445 --> 01:17:55.160
Okay, sorry.
No.

01:17:55.195 --> 01:18:00.007
No, no, no, wait, I thought
you were someone else.

01:18:01.568 --> 01:18:05.072
I thought you were Spike.
I'm thrilled that you're not.

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:08.137
Wow.

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:12.307
What?

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.180
Nothing.

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:56.450
It does strike me as, well, surreal
that I'm allowed to see you naked.

01:19:56.485 --> 01:19:58.585
You and every person
in this country.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.394
God, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:05.965
What is it about men and
nudity? Particularly breasts.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.896
And how can you be
so interested in them?

01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:10.962
Well...

01:20:10.997 --> 01:20:13.374
No, but seriously.
They're just breasts.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.234
Every second person
in the world has them.

01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:18.038
Well, more than that, actually,
when you think about it.

01:20:18.073 --> 01:20:20.814
You know, Meatloaf
has a very nice pair.

01:20:21.408 --> 01:20:25.077
But they're odd looking.
They're for milk.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:28.915
Your mother has them. You've
seen a thousand of them.

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.985
What's all the funs about?

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:35.657
Actually, I can't think what it is,
really. Let me just have a quick look.

01:20:40.827 --> 01:20:42.465
No, no, beats me.

01:20:46.867 --> 01:20:49.040
Rita Hayworth used to say,

01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:53.783
"They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me. "

01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:56.376
Who was Gilda?

01:20:56.576 --> 01:20:58.385
Her most famous part.

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:02.414
Men went to bed
with the dream,

01:21:02.449 --> 01:21:05.725
and they didn't like it when
they woke up with reality.

01:21:07.587 --> 01:21:09.396
Do you feel that way?

01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:15.762
You are lovelier this morning
than you have ever been.

01:21:19.766 --> 01:21:21.506
I'll be right back.

01:21:35.115 --> 01:21:36.753
Breakfast in bed.

01:21:38.118 --> 01:21:40.860
Or it's brunch, or lunch,
or something.

01:21:41.288 --> 01:21:42.528
My God.

01:21:44.457 --> 01:21:46.436
Can I stay a bit longer?

01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:50.730
Stay forever.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.601
Okay.

01:21:55.068 --> 01:21:56.706
I forgot the jam.

01:22:00.407 --> 01:22:02.910
I'll get the jam,
you get the door.

01:22:18.358 --> 01:22:19.859
Jesus Christ.

01:22:23.263 --> 01:22:24.366
What?

01:22:25.966 --> 01:22:27.342
What is it?

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:29.301
Nothing, really.

01:22:29.336 --> 01:22:31.204
You're up to something.

01:22:31.239 --> 01:22:32.546
Anna, no, please.

01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:37.986
Oh, my God.

01:22:38.545 --> 01:22:41.753
And they got a picture
of you dressed like that.

01:22:41.882 --> 01:22:43.019
Yes.

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.155
Undressed like this, yeah.

01:22:48.955 --> 01:22:50.355
Morning, darling ones.

01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:54.429
It's me. The press are here.
No, there are hundreds of them.

01:22:54.895 --> 01:23:00.504
My brilliant plan was not so brilliant. I
know. I know. I know. Just get over here.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.906
Dammit.

01:23:08.074 --> 01:23:09.876
I wouldn't go outside.

01:23:09.911 --> 01:23:10.945
Why not?

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.816
Just take my word for it.

01:23:38.838 --> 01:23:43.141
How did I look?
Not bad. Not at all bad.

01:23:43.176 --> 01:23:47.283
Well-chosen briefs, I'd say.
Chicks love gray.

01:23:47.948 --> 01:23:50.553
Nice, firm buttocks.

01:23:54.921 --> 01:23:56.688
How are you doing?

01:23:56.723 --> 01:23:58.862
How do you think I'm doing?

01:24:01.094 --> 01:24:02.162
I don't know what happened.

01:24:02.197 --> 01:24:03.261
Oh, I do.

01:24:03.296 --> 01:24:08.245
Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck
or two, telling the papers where I was.

01:24:08.435 --> 01:24:09.834
That's not true.
Really?

01:24:09.869 --> 01:24:12.238
The entire British press got
up this morning and thought,

01:24:12.273 --> 01:24:13.571
"I know where Anna Scott is.

01:24:13.606 --> 01:24:16.609
"She's in that house with the
blue door in Notting Hill. "

01:24:16.644 --> 01:24:19.429
And then you go out
in your goddamn underwear.

01:24:19.464 --> 01:24:22.215
I went out in my goddamn
underwear, too. Get out.

01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:23.800
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:24:23.835 --> 01:24:25.351
I'm so sorry.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.486
This is such an
unbelievable mess.

01:24:28.521 --> 01:24:31.491
I come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,

01:24:31.526 --> 01:24:33.944
and now I've just landed
in it all over again.

01:24:33.979 --> 01:24:36.363
I mean, for God's sake,
I've got a boyfriend.

01:24:36.398 --> 01:24:37.529
You have?

01:24:37.564 --> 01:24:40.200
Well, as far as they're
concerned I do. Yes.

01:24:40.235 --> 01:24:41.833
And now, tomorrow,
there'll be pictures

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:44.974
of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu.

01:24:45.705 --> 01:24:47.707
I know that.
But let's stay calm.

01:24:47.742 --> 01:24:49.674
No, you can stay calm!
Right.

01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:52.045
All right, this is a perfect
situation for you, isn't it?

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.312
Minimum input,
maximum publicity.

01:24:54.347 --> 01:24:58.785
Everywhere you go people will say, "Oh,
well done. You slept with that actress.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.662
"We saw the pictures. "

01:25:01.187 --> 01:25:03.394
That is spectacularly unfair.

01:25:04.024 --> 01:25:05.790
Who knows, maybe it'll
even help business.

01:25:05.825 --> 01:25:08.495
"Buy a boring book about Egypt from
the guy that screwed Anna Scott. "

01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:13.341
Now, stop. Stop.
Stop, I beg you. Calm down.

01:25:13.533 --> 01:25:14.632
Have a cup of tea.

01:25:14.667 --> 01:25:17.010
I don't want a
goddamn cup of tea.

01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:19.639
I just wanna go home.

01:25:20.807 --> 01:25:24.878
Spike, see who that is. And put
some clothes on, for God's sake.

01:25:24.913 --> 01:25:26.811
Looks like a chauffeur to me.

01:25:26.846 --> 01:25:28.980
Spike owes you an expensive
dinner. Or holiday.

01:25:29.015 --> 01:25:32.018
Depending if he's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.

01:25:32.053 --> 01:25:36.261
That is not true. Wait a
minute. This is crazy behavior.

01:25:36.956 --> 01:25:40.025
Can't we just laugh
about all this?

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:43.663
Seriously, in the huge sweep of
things, this stuff doesn't matter.

01:25:43.698 --> 01:25:47.484
What he's gonna say next is there's
people starving in the Sudan.

01:25:47.519 --> 01:25:51.271
Well, there are. And we don't
have to go anywhere near that far.

01:25:51.306 --> 01:25:52.504
My best friend slipped.

01:25:52.539 --> 01:25:54.205
She slipped down stairs,
cracked her back,

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.775
and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

01:25:56.810 --> 01:26:00.723
You know, all I'm asking for is
a normal amount of perspective.

01:26:01.247 --> 01:26:03.782
You're right.
Of course, you're right.

01:26:03.817 --> 01:26:06.684
It's just that I've dealt
with this garbage for 10 years.

01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:11.861
You've had it for 10 minutes. Our
perspectives are very different.

01:26:12.025 --> 01:26:15.695
I mean, today's newspapers will be
lining tomorrow's wastepaper bins.

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:17.262
Excuse me?

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:19.743
Well, you know,
it's just one day.

01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:23.636
Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.

01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:28.410
You really don't get it.
This story will be filed.

01:26:28.675 --> 01:26:31.845
Every time anyone writes
anything about me,

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.654
they'll dig up these photos.

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:37.693
Newspapers last forever.
I'll regret this forever.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:46.929
Right.

01:26:48.128 --> 01:26:51.965
I will feel the opposite,
if that's okay by you.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.915
And always be glad
that you came to stay.

01:27:00.273 --> 01:27:01.479
But...

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:04.955
You're probably right.
You'd better go.

01:27:45.919 --> 01:27:47.329
Was it you?

01:27:50.657 --> 01:27:54.297
I may have told a few
people down the pub.

01:27:56.996 --> 01:27:58.167
Right.

01:29:49.142 --> 01:29:50.708
Have I got something for you.

01:29:50.743 --> 01:29:52.310
Something which will
make you love me so much,

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:55.792
you will want to hug me every
day for the rest of my life.

01:29:55.915 --> 01:29:57.655
Blimey, what is it?

01:29:59.018 --> 01:30:03.364
Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London and her agent in New York.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:11.831
Listen, you think about her all
the time. Now you can ring her.

01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:14.641
Yeah. Brilliant, thanks.

01:30:14.767 --> 01:30:18.305
I'll see you tonight.
Hi, Marty. Sexy cardi.

01:30:45.698 --> 01:30:48.433
Hello. I have a little
speech to make.

01:30:48.468 --> 01:30:51.504
I won't stand up because
I can't be bothered.

01:30:53.473 --> 01:30:55.573
Exactly a year ago today,

01:30:55.608 --> 01:30:58.611
this man here started the
finest restaurant in London.

01:30:58.646 --> 01:31:00.011
Hear, hear.
Thank you very much.

01:31:00.046 --> 01:31:02.749
Unfortunately, no one
ever came to eat here.

01:31:02.784 --> 01:31:04.558
It's a tiny hiccough.

01:31:05.718 --> 01:31:07.385
And so, we have to
face the fact that

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:11.026
from next week, we must
find somewhere new to eat.

01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:15.637
I just want to say to Tony,
don't take it personally.

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:20.666
The more I think about things, the
more I see no rhyme or reason in life.

01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:24.604
No one knows why some things
work out and some things don't.

01:31:24.639 --> 01:31:28.142
Why some of us get lucky,
and some of us...

01:31:28.474 --> 01:31:30.283
Get fired.
What?

01:31:30.843 --> 01:31:33.913
Yeah, well, it seems they're
shifting the whole outfit

01:31:33.948 --> 01:31:36.620
much more towards
the emerging markets.

01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:40.485
And of course, well,
I was total crap, so...

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.523
A toast to Bernie, the worst
stockbroker in the whole world.

01:31:43.558 --> 01:31:46.292
I thank you. And Tony,
the worst restaurateur.

01:31:46.327 --> 01:31:48.144
Tony and Bernie.
Both crap.

01:31:48.179 --> 01:31:49.927
The terrible two.

01:31:49.962 --> 01:31:51.998
In their own special ways.

01:31:54.434 --> 01:31:58.973
Since it's an evening of
announcements, I've also got one.

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.841
I've decided to get engaged.

01:32:03.876 --> 01:32:07.846
I've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke.

01:32:09.215 --> 01:32:12.924
Who I know is gonna make me
happy for the rest of my life.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.788
Well, wait a sec. I mean...

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:19.942
I'm your brother. I don't
know anything about this.

01:32:19.977 --> 01:32:23.062
Is he... I don't know,
is he financially viable?

01:32:24.230 --> 01:32:27.108
He's an artist with
brilliant prospects.

01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:31.471
This is a secret you've
been keeping from me?

01:32:31.506 --> 01:32:33.204
No. No. I swear.

01:32:33.239 --> 01:32:35.048
By the way, it's you.

01:32:38.377 --> 01:32:39.446
Me?

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.186
What do you think?

01:32:42.982 --> 01:32:44.392
Well, yeah.

01:32:47.453 --> 01:32:48.693
Groovy.

01:32:50.656 --> 01:32:54.994
Excuse me, are there
any more announcements?

01:32:55.029 --> 01:32:57.094
Well, actually, yes.

01:32:57.129 --> 01:33:01.907
I feel I should apologize to everyone
for my behavior over the last six months.

01:33:02.401 --> 01:33:05.803
I have, as you know, been
somewhat down in the mouth.

01:33:05.838 --> 01:33:08.409
Well, there's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

01:33:09.775 --> 01:33:13.446
But I just wish to make it
clear that I've turned a corner,

01:33:13.481 --> 01:33:17.394
and henceforward intend
to be impressively happy.

01:33:38.704 --> 01:33:42.379
Oh, God, I'm horribly drunk.

01:33:43.509 --> 01:33:44.783
Me, too.

01:33:45.211 --> 01:33:46.553
Come here.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:52.752
So you've laid the ghost?

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.593
I believe I have.

01:33:56.822 --> 01:33:59.564
Don't give a damn
about the famous girl?

01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:03.630
No. No, I don't think I do.

01:34:05.231 --> 01:34:08.234
Which means you won't be distracted
by the fact that she's back in London,

01:34:08.269 --> 01:34:09.700
grasping her Oscar,

01:34:09.735 --> 01:34:13.774
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.175
Oh, God, no.

01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:22.455
So, not over her, in fact.

01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:08.228
Can I help you?
Yeah.

01:35:09.295 --> 01:35:10.579
I'm looking for Anna Scott.

01:35:10.614 --> 01:35:11.864
Does she know you're coming?

01:35:11.899 --> 01:35:13.164
No.

01:35:13.199 --> 01:35:15.433
No, she doesn't.

01:35:15.468 --> 01:35:17.435
I'm afraid I can't
let you through, sir.

01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:21.941
Right. I mean, I am actually
a friend. I'm not a lunatic.

01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:25.429
But no, you basically...

01:35:25.464 --> 01:35:27.016
Can't let you through, sir.

01:36:08.587 --> 01:36:10.221
Well, this is...

01:36:10.256 --> 01:36:13.100
I only found out
you were here yesterday.

01:36:14.393 --> 01:36:16.062
Well, I was going to call,
but I...

01:36:16.097 --> 01:36:17.298
Anna.

01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:18.499
Yes.

01:36:20.066 --> 01:36:22.101
Things aren't going very well
and it's our last day.

01:36:22.136 --> 01:36:26.060
Absolutely, yeah,
you're clearly very busy.

01:36:26.095 --> 01:36:29.984
But if you could wait,
there are things to say.

01:36:34.947 --> 01:36:36.084
Okay.

01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:41.090
Drink tea.
There's lots of tea.

01:36:48.494 --> 01:36:50.303
Come and have a look.

01:36:54.266 --> 01:36:56.473
Are you a fan of Henry James?

01:36:57.136 --> 01:36:58.637
This is a Henry James film?

01:36:58.672 --> 01:36:59.877
Yeah.

01:37:08.481 --> 01:37:09.613
This is Harry.

01:37:09.648 --> 01:37:13.052
He'll give you a pair of headphones,
so you can hear the dialogue.

01:37:13.087 --> 01:37:14.720
Thank you very much.
No problem.

01:37:14.755 --> 01:37:15.820
Hi.

01:37:15.855 --> 01:37:18.699
Hi, here we go.
Volume's on the side.

01:37:18.824 --> 01:37:20.025
There. Have a seat.

01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:21.128
Thank you.

01:37:29.735 --> 01:37:32.371
We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.

01:37:32.406 --> 01:37:35.007
Well, we've got to. I have
to be in New York on Thursday.

01:37:35.042 --> 01:37:36.679
Stop showing off.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:39.812
God, that's an enormous arse.

01:37:39.847 --> 01:37:41.518
I'm not listening.

01:37:41.647 --> 01:37:43.647
No, but seriously,
it's not fair.

01:37:43.682 --> 01:37:46.684
So many tragic young
teenagers with anorexia,

01:37:46.719 --> 01:37:48.888
and that girl has an arse she
could perfectly well share around

01:37:48.923 --> 01:37:52.426
with at least 10 other women,
and still be big bottomed.

01:37:52.892 --> 01:37:54.959
I would think, looking at
something nice like that,

01:37:54.994 --> 01:38:00.967
you and your bony little excuse for an
arse would be well advised to keep quiet.

01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:04.368
Now, down to business,
the end of the scene.

01:38:04.403 --> 01:38:07.748
I ask you when you're telling
everyone, and you say...

01:38:08.908 --> 01:38:11.217
"Tomorrow will be
soon enough. "

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:14.013
And then I... Right, okay.

01:38:14.613 --> 01:38:18.184
So who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

01:38:18.219 --> 01:38:19.390
No one.

01:38:21.487 --> 01:38:23.626
Just some guy from the past.

01:38:24.256 --> 01:38:28.932
It's a bit of an awkward situation
really. I don't know what he's doing here.

01:38:45.244 --> 01:38:46.586
Of course.

01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:55.855
Thanks, I've got to...

01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:57.265
Any time.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.203
Ladies and gentlemen, can we have
you all on your first marks, please.

01:39:11.238 --> 01:39:12.977
On your first marks.

01:39:26.151 --> 01:39:28.858
I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

01:39:28.988 --> 01:39:31.331
but there's
a delivery for you.

01:39:32.224 --> 01:39:34.892
Martin, really,
can't you just do it yourself?

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:38.397
But you see, this is not for
the shop. This is for you.

01:39:40.766 --> 01:39:42.066
Right, okay.

01:39:42.101 --> 01:39:47.050
Now tell me, if I employed a wet rag,
would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?

01:39:50.743 --> 01:39:51.744
Hi.

01:39:53.812 --> 01:39:54.983
Hello.

01:39:55.881 --> 01:39:57.915
You disappeared.

01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:01.069
Yeah. Yeah, I had to leave.

01:40:01.104 --> 01:40:04.189
I didn't want to disturb.

01:40:04.224 --> 01:40:06.258
How have you been?

01:40:06.293 --> 01:40:07.558
Fine. Fine.

01:40:07.593 --> 01:40:09.093
I don't know, everything
much the same, you know.

01:40:09.128 --> 01:40:12.939
When they change the law, Spike
and I will marry immediately.

01:40:13.532 --> 01:40:17.275
Whereas you, I've watched
in wonder. Awards, glory.

01:40:17.569 --> 01:40:21.278
Oh, no, it's all nonsense,
believe me.

01:40:21.874 --> 01:40:26.447
I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but nonsense it all is.

01:40:29.782 --> 01:40:33.889
Well, yesterday was
our last day of filming,

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:36.561
so I'm leaving.

01:40:38.424 --> 01:40:39.630
But...

01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:47.299
I brought this for you from home.
So I thought I'd give it to you.

01:40:50.035 --> 01:40:51.377
Thank you.

01:40:54.006 --> 01:40:55.808
Shall I...
Oh, no, don't open it now,

01:40:55.843 --> 01:40:57.582
I'll be embarrassed.

01:40:59.745 --> 01:41:03.649
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

01:41:03.684 --> 01:41:07.528
I actually had it in my
apartment. I thought you...

01:41:10.522 --> 01:41:12.222
But when it came to it,

01:41:12.257 --> 01:41:15.727
I didn't know how to call,
having behaved so badly.

01:41:16.462 --> 01:41:17.668
Twice.

01:41:19.765 --> 01:41:22.802
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

01:41:24.269 --> 01:41:27.875
Then you came,
and I figured...

01:41:32.244 --> 01:41:36.817
The thing is...

01:41:39.685 --> 01:41:41.664
What? What is the thing?

01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:47.126
Don't even think about it.
Go away, immediately. Go away.

01:41:47.161 --> 01:41:49.128
Right. Sorry.

01:41:53.532 --> 01:41:55.170
You were saying?

01:41:57.536 --> 01:41:58.605
Yes.

01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:05.652
I have to go away today,
but I wondered if I didn't,

01:42:07.613 --> 01:42:10.616
whether you might
let me see you a little,

01:42:11.817 --> 01:42:14.559
or a lot, maybe.

01:42:18.223 --> 01:42:20.566
See if you could
like me again.

01:42:21.827 --> 01:42:23.929
But yesterday that actor
asked you who I was

01:42:23.964 --> 01:42:26.602
and you just dismissed
me out of hand.

01:42:27.733 --> 01:42:28.973
I heard.

01:42:30.903 --> 01:42:33.937
You had a microphone,
I had headphones.

01:42:33.972 --> 01:42:36.508
What, you expect me to tell
the truth about my life

01:42:36.543 --> 01:42:39.147
to the most indiscreet
man in England?

01:42:41.513 --> 01:42:44.459
Excuse me. It's your
mother on the phone.

01:42:47.986 --> 01:42:50.454
Will you tell her I'll
ring her back, please?

01:42:50.489 --> 01:42:53.459
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

01:42:53.494 --> 01:42:55.359
and it's now been
about 24 hours

01:42:55.394 --> 01:42:58.897
and the foot that was purple is
now sort of blackish in color and...

01:42:58.932 --> 01:43:02.367
Right, right, yeah.
Perfect timing as ever.

01:43:04.736 --> 01:43:07.079
Martin,
hold the fort a second.

01:43:08.841 --> 01:43:10.411
Yes, all right.

01:43:16.915 --> 01:43:22.126
Could I just say, I thought
Ghost was the most wonderful film.

01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:25.524
Is that right?

01:43:25.559 --> 01:43:26.764
Oh, yes.

01:43:31.597 --> 01:43:36.842
I've always wondered what Patrick
Swayze's like in real life.

01:43:38.137 --> 01:43:40.756
I can't say that I know
Patrick all that well.

01:43:40.791 --> 01:43:43.340
What, he wasn't that
friendly during filming?

01:43:43.375 --> 01:43:48.688
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

01:43:52.918 --> 01:43:54.556
Oh, right. Sorry.

01:43:55.454 --> 01:43:58.491
Right. Always been
a bit of an ass.

01:44:02.094 --> 01:44:05.837
Anyway, well,
it was lovely to meet you.

01:44:05.964 --> 01:44:11.038
I'm a huge fan of yours.
And Demi's of course.

01:44:14.173 --> 01:44:15.845
Sorry about that.

01:44:17.009 --> 01:44:18.142
That's fine.

01:44:18.177 --> 01:44:22.591
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:26.029
Anna, look...

01:44:27.653 --> 01:44:30.030
I'm a fairly
level-headed bloke.

01:44:31.456 --> 01:44:36.462
Not often in and
out of love. But...

01:44:42.301 --> 01:44:47.648
Can I just say "no" to your kind
request, and leave it at that?

01:44:52.277 --> 01:44:53.346
Yes.

01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:57.917
Fine. Of course, I...

01:44:59.284 --> 01:45:00.660
Of course.

01:45:03.255 --> 01:45:06.725
Well, I'll just be going then.
It was nice to see you.

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:11.970
The thing is,
with you I'm in real danger.

01:45:13.098 --> 01:45:18.172
It seems like a perfect situation,
apart from that foul temper of yours.

01:45:18.437 --> 01:45:22.374
But my relatively
inexperienced heart

01:45:22.409 --> 01:45:24.945
would, I fear, not recover

01:45:25.444 --> 01:45:31.292
if I was once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:35.588
There are just too many
pictures of you, too many films.

01:45:36.421 --> 01:45:41.393
You know, you'd go, and I'd
be well-buggered, basically.

01:45:44.062 --> 01:45:47.202
That really is a real
"no," isn't it?

01:45:47.366 --> 01:45:50.779
I live in Notting Hill.
You live in Beverly Hills.

01:45:51.903 --> 01:45:54.292
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

01:45:54.327 --> 01:45:56.682
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

01:45:58.143 --> 01:45:59.314
Fine.

01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:03.354
Fine. Good decision.

01:46:04.683 --> 01:46:06.184
Good decision.

01:46:09.554 --> 01:46:12.899
The fame thing isn't
really real, you know.

01:46:16.895 --> 01:46:19.136
And don't forget,

01:46:20.532 --> 01:46:25.879
I'm also just a girl
standing in front of a boy,

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.551
asking him to love her.

01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:43.590
Bye.

01:47:06.945 --> 01:47:09.414
So, what do you think?
Good move?

01:47:09.449 --> 01:47:11.615
Yeah, good move.

01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:14.753
I mean, when all's said and
done, she's nothing special.

01:47:14.788 --> 01:47:16.153
I saw her taking
her trousers down

01:47:16.188 --> 01:47:19.533
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

01:47:20.292 --> 01:47:24.463
Good decision, yeah. All
actresses are as mad as snakes.

01:47:24.498 --> 01:47:26.048
Tones, what do you reckon?

01:47:26.083 --> 01:47:27.599
Never met her, never want to.

01:47:27.634 --> 01:47:29.366
Brilliant. Max?

01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:31.403
Absolutely.
Never trust a vegetarian.

01:47:31.438 --> 01:47:34.008
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

01:47:36.942 --> 01:47:38.912
I was called and I came.
What's up?

01:47:38.947 --> 01:47:40.883
William's just turned
down Anna Scott.

01:47:42.114 --> 01:47:45.015
You daft prick.

01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:48.087
No, no. No, no,
it's actually quite sensible.

01:47:51.623 --> 01:47:54.729
That painting
isn't the original, is it?

01:47:56.661 --> 01:47:59.232
You know, I think it might be,
yeah.

01:48:00.766 --> 01:48:03.644
But she said she wanted
to go out with you?

01:48:05.771 --> 01:48:07.404
Yeah.

01:48:07.439 --> 01:48:09.077
Well, that's nice.

01:48:10.642 --> 01:48:11.779
What?

01:48:13.378 --> 01:48:15.612
Well, you know,

01:48:15.647 --> 01:48:19.822
anyone saying they wanna go out
with you is pretty great, isn't it?

01:48:25.690 --> 01:48:30.366
It was sort of sweet,
actually.

01:48:32.164 --> 01:48:36.902
I mean, I know she's an actress and
all that, so she can deliver a line,

01:48:36.937 --> 01:48:42.374
but she said she might be
as famous as she can be

01:48:42.409 --> 01:48:46.344
but also that
she was just a girl,

01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.260
standing in front of a boy,

01:48:53.018 --> 01:48:55.555
asking him to love her.

01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:14.139
Oh, sod a dog. I've made the
wrong decision, haven't I?

01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:21.149
Max, how fast is your car?

01:49:24.683 --> 01:49:25.749
Good luck.

01:49:25.784 --> 01:49:28.453
If anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

01:49:28.488 --> 01:49:30.856
Where to? The Ritz. All
I can think is The Ritz.

01:49:30.891 --> 01:49:33.091
Where's Bella?
She's not coming.

01:49:33.126 --> 01:49:35.027
Oh, sod that.
What?

01:49:35.062 --> 01:49:36.928
Bernie, sit in the back.

01:49:38.463 --> 01:49:40.203
Max, I'm okay.

01:49:43.001 --> 01:49:44.536
Come on, baby.

01:49:47.172 --> 01:49:48.707
Mind your back.

01:49:52.978 --> 01:49:54.644
Which way
are you going?

01:49:54.679 --> 01:49:55.912
Down Kensington
Church Street,

01:49:55.947 --> 01:49:57.082
then Knightsbridge,
then Hyde Park Corner.

01:49:57.117 --> 01:49:58.181
No, no, crazy. Crazy.

01:49:58.216 --> 01:50:00.016
Go along Bayswater.
That's right. Then Park Lane.

01:50:00.051 --> 01:50:02.087
No. No. Straight down to the
Cromwell Road, then left.

01:50:02.122 --> 01:50:03.531
No!

01:50:05.457 --> 01:50:08.767
Stop right there! I will
decide the route. All right?

01:50:09.294 --> 01:50:10.670
Sorry, Max.

01:50:12.464 --> 01:50:14.699
James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.

01:50:22.574 --> 01:50:24.809
Turn right. Turn right!
I can't, it's one way.

01:50:24.844 --> 01:50:26.013
Well, do a U-turn.

01:50:26.048 --> 01:50:27.182
Oh, sod it.

01:50:27.312 --> 01:50:28.380
Hold on!

01:50:34.586 --> 01:50:35.928
Brilliant!

01:50:44.329 --> 01:50:46.331
Bloody hell, this is fun.

01:50:47.399 --> 01:50:50.345
Hi. Is Miss Scott
staying here?

01:50:50.468 --> 01:50:51.535
No, sir.

01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:53.413
How about Miss Flintstone?

01:50:54.072 --> 01:50:55.323
No, sir.

01:50:55.358 --> 01:50:56.667
Bambi?

01:50:56.702 --> 01:50:57.941
No, sir.

01:50:57.976 --> 01:51:03.721
Or, I don't know,
Beavis or Butt-head?

01:51:04.249 --> 01:51:05.523
No, sir.

01:51:06.985 --> 01:51:09.362
Thanks. Thanks.

01:51:10.722 --> 01:51:15.102
There was a Miss Pocahontas, but
she checked out about an hour ago.

01:51:15.226 --> 01:51:20.198
I believe she's holding a press conference
at the Savoy, before flying to America.

01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:27.542
We have lift off.

01:51:36.381 --> 01:51:38.622
You have message for Takiama?

01:51:39.451 --> 01:51:41.260
I'll just check, sir.

01:52:03.742 --> 01:52:06.279
Bugger this for
a bunch of bananas.

01:52:10.582 --> 01:52:13.451
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:52:13.486 --> 01:52:14.986
Go. Go.

01:52:16.988 --> 01:52:22.563
Hang on. Come on. Wait there!
Come on, come on! Wait!

01:52:24.095 --> 01:52:26.131
Go on, go, go, go!

01:52:27.565 --> 01:52:29.100
You're my hero!

01:52:31.636 --> 01:52:33.012
Down, boy.

01:52:43.982 --> 01:52:44.983
Go!

01:52:53.291 --> 01:52:54.924
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?

01:52:54.959 --> 01:52:56.292
Where's the press conference,
please?

01:52:56.327 --> 01:52:58.196
Are you an accredited
member of the press?

01:52:58.231 --> 01:52:59.299
Yeah.

01:53:01.466 --> 01:53:02.799
There you go.

01:53:02.834 --> 01:53:05.954
Yes, that's a Blockbuster
Video membership card, sir.

01:53:05.989 --> 01:53:09.074
That's right. I work for
their in-house magazine.

01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:10.575
Movies Are Our Business.

01:53:10.610 --> 01:53:11.860
I'm sorry, sir.

01:53:11.895 --> 01:53:13.170
He's with me.

01:53:13.205 --> 01:53:14.411
And you are?

01:53:14.446 --> 01:53:18.621
Writing an article on how London
hotels treat people in wheelchairs.

01:53:19.551 --> 01:53:20.750
Yes, of course, madam.

01:53:20.785 --> 01:53:24.892
It's in the Lancaster Room, though
I'm afraid you're rather late.

01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:26.259
Run!

01:53:42.307 --> 01:53:46.411
Does this mean that Miss Scott will
not be publicizing her next film?

01:53:46.446 --> 01:53:48.411
No, it absolutely
does not mean that.

01:53:48.446 --> 01:53:51.549
She'll be abiding by all
her present commitments.

01:53:51.584 --> 01:53:54.652
She just won't be making
any more for the next year.

01:53:54.687 --> 01:53:56.927
When will the
film be released?

01:53:57.055 --> 01:54:00.859
At the moment, the plan is to release
in America towards the end of the autumn,

01:54:00.894 --> 01:54:04.602
and over here, around Christmas,
or early in the New Year.

01:54:04.796 --> 01:54:07.139
Right! Dominic.

01:54:07.365 --> 01:54:10.502
Anna, how much longer are
you staying in the UK then?

01:54:10.537 --> 01:54:12.235
No time at all.
I leave tonight.

01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:16.718
Which is why we have to round things
up now, so final questions, please.

01:54:17.375 --> 01:54:19.013
Yes, lady there.

01:54:19.711 --> 01:54:23.815
Is your decision to take a year off
anything to do with the rumors about Jeff

01:54:23.850 --> 01:54:25.517
and his present leading lady?

01:54:25.552 --> 01:54:27.050
Absolutely not.

01:54:27.085 --> 01:54:28.785
Do you believe the rumors?

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:32.055
Well, it's really
not my business anymore.

01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:37.938
Though, I will say, from my experience,
rumors about Jeff do tend to be true.

01:54:40.498 --> 01:54:41.631
Yeah.

01:54:41.666 --> 01:54:44.803
The last time you were here, there
were some fairly graphic photographs

01:54:44.838 --> 01:54:48.375
taken of you with
a young English guy.

01:54:49.073 --> 01:54:51.280
So, what happened there?

01:54:51.643 --> 01:54:54.919
He was just a friend.
We're still friends, I think.

01:54:56.714 --> 01:55:00.992
Right. Yes, gentleman
in the pink shirt.

01:55:06.524 --> 01:55:07.593
Yes.

01:55:08.993 --> 01:55:13.900
Miss Scott, are there any
circumstances in which

01:55:13.935 --> 01:55:18.807
the two of you might be
more than just good friends?

01:55:21.506 --> 01:55:26.512
I hoped there would be, but
no, I'm assured there aren't.

01:55:26.644 --> 01:55:27.844
But what would you say if...

01:55:27.879 --> 01:55:29.714
I'm sorry,
just the one question, please.

01:55:29.749 --> 01:55:32.251
No, it's all right.
You were saying?

01:55:34.319 --> 01:55:40.030
I was just wondering if it
turned out that this person...

01:55:41.159 --> 01:55:43.595
Thacker. His name's Thacker.

01:55:43.630 --> 01:55:45.165
Thanks. Thanks.

01:55:45.496 --> 01:55:49.667
I just wondered whether
if Mr. Thacker realized

01:55:49.702 --> 01:55:52.170
he'd been a daft prick

01:55:54.372 --> 01:55:58.276
And got down on his knees
and begged you to reconsider,

01:55:58.311 --> 01:56:03.350
whether you would,
in fact, then reconsider?

01:56:13.591 --> 01:56:15.502
Yes, I believe I would.

01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:20.707
That's very good news.

01:56:23.635 --> 01:56:27.472
The readers of Horse & Hound
will be absolutely delighted.

01:56:33.811 --> 01:56:37.515
Right, Dominic, if you'd like
to ask your question again?

01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:38.516
Yeah.

01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:42.522
Anna, how long are you intending
to stay here in Britain?

01:56:50.295 --> 01:56:51.796
Indefinitely.

01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:17.706
What happened?

01:57:17.741 --> 01:57:19.193
It was good.

01:57:40.745 --> 01:57:42.781
Are you gonna get married?

01:57:43.305 --> 01:57:49.211
