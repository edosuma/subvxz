Ugh! ... What's going on here?

00:40.960 --> 00:43.077
It's Steven tag.
Steven tagged you.

01:28.561 --> 01:33.895
<i>See those holes? Their shape and
pattern is repeated over and over.</i>

01:33.930 --> 01:37.114
Some might say it's coincidence.

01:37.115 --> 01:39.906
I say there's something... more!

01:39.941 --> 01:44.009
- Like what? A double coincidence?
- You'd already be in the know

01:44.076 --> 01:47.358
If you followed my blog ...
Keep Beach City weird!

01:47.359 --> 01:50.622
I document all the weird
things that happen in

01:50.623 --> 01:53.885
Beach City! You can't
always trust facts and books!

01:53.953 --> 01:56.835
I'm out here hunting the truth!

01:56.986 --> 02:01.309
Oh, there you are! Dad
wants you back at the shop!

02:01.377 --> 02:06.781
- You're missing out on valuable frying time!
- It's weird time, Peedee!

02:06.849 --> 02:11.853
- I'm doing big stuff! Cover for me!
- Fine.

02:11.921 --> 02:15.356
But this is the last time, or
I'm telling dad! Big stuff...

02:15.424 --> 02:21.696
- I'll give you big stuff.
- So, you want to get your hands really dirty?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.553
- Then follow me.
- Yeah!

02:31.398 --> 02:35.326
- I can't wait to find something paranormal!
- Shh! I'm picking up a quantum flux

02:35.394 --> 02:40.331
- on the weirdometer. There!
- Whoa!

02:40.432 --> 02:42.623
Did they fall from the sky?

02:42.624 --> 02:47.005
My research suggests they
grew up from the ground.

02:49.258 --> 02:53.403
- Ronaldo! Look at this.
- According to an online

02:53.404 --> 02:57.548
encyclopedia, which I am
a user/editor of, this species

02:57.616 --> 03:00.325
isn't indigenous to this region.

03:00.326 --> 03:04.389
Or this dimension-sion-sion-sion!

03:04.490 --> 03:06.344
We live in a strange world, Steven ...

03:06.345 --> 03:10.342
stranger than most know ...
stranger than they care to know.

03:10.377 --> 03:13.765
Take my brother, for instance.
He's always getting on my case,

03:13.832 --> 03:16.854
telling me to work more.
He'll never understand.

03:16.855 --> 03:19.982
But, Steven, I can tell you're like me.

03:20.017 --> 03:23.765
- Yeah!
- I know you're someone I can trust.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.345
<i> You're ready for what
I've found ... The cause of</i>

03:27.446 --> 03:31.482
- Beach City's paranormal activity.
- Wait. What?

03:31.550 --> 03:35.658
Welcome to my office. Go that way.

03:35.684 --> 03:38.627
Welcome... to the truth.

03:40.225 --> 03:43.968
- Snake people?!
- Snake people, or "sneople",

03:43.969 --> 03:47.869
control our government at
the highest level.

03:47.870 --> 03:51.769
Look, the snake represents
their hold on our country.

03:51.870 --> 03:56.274
The diamond represents their
underground mines or their sharp teeth.

03:56.341 --> 03:58.342
The details aren't important!

03:58.343 --> 04:02.346
They pit us mammals against each
other with elections, sports,

04:02.448 --> 04:06.511
and anime message boards.
We spend so much time

04:06.512 --> 04:11.256
fighting over "dubs" or "subs"
that we miss the big picture!

04:11.457 --> 04:17.089
- What's that?
- That the world is under their control.

Steven, don't slam the door!

04:28.440 --> 04:32.266
Amethyst! Pearl!
We need to snake-proof the house!

04:32.301 --> 04:35.063
- Why?
- To stop the Snake people!

04:35.098 --> 04:37.682
Uh... Snake people?!

04:37.749 --> 04:41.485
What's so funny
about Sneople?! Look at this!

04:41.553 --> 04:45.089
That must be from when we
fought those drill parasites on the beach.

04:45.157 --> 04:49.493
- Wha? Well, what about this?
- That looks like pieces

04:49.561 --> 04:53.660
- of that red eye that we blew up.
- Well, what about this?!

04:53.695 --> 04:56.767
Oh, it's the flowers from Rose's moss!

04:56.835 --> 05:01.238
Is all the weird stuff that
happens at Beach City because of us?

05:01.340 --> 05:06.505
- Well, yeah, obviously.
- I need some air.

05:06.994 --> 05:10.523
- Ronaldo?
- Steven! Did you see this crater?

05:10.558 --> 05:13.585
I think the snake people might
have left it as a sign.

05:13.586 --> 05:17.230
- Yeah... Uh, Ronaldo?
- Yes, Steven?

05:17.231 --> 05:21.559
Are you totally sure
about this snake people thing?

05:21.626 --> 05:27.232
- Steven, are you having doubts?
- Not really just... doubts.

05:27.267 --> 05:29.567
I found out those weird
holes in the cliff were 'cause of

05:29.634 --> 05:31.419
something me and the gems did.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.561
- Well, okay, but those red rocks ...
- That was us.

05:34.562 --> 05:37.141
- But... the flowers.
- Us too.

05:37.242 --> 05:39.710
- But ... But the truth!
- Maybe the truth

05:39.711 --> 05:42.179
just isn't what you thought it was.

05:42.247 --> 05:46.050
Sure it is! Don't get so
hung up on these minor facts.

05:46.118 --> 05:47.972
Truth is about more than that.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.755
Truth is a feeling in your
gut that you know is true.

05:50.822 --> 05:54.044
Truth is searching for anything
that proves you're right,

05:54.045 --> 05:58.636
no matter how small, and holding
on to that, no matter what.

05:58.637 --> 06:02.199
That kind of sounds
like the opposite of truth.

06:02.267 --> 06:03.726
Look! The proof!

06:03.727 --> 06:08.105
This cast will show the
true face of this conspiracy!

06:08.173 --> 06:12.209
- Oh, huh?
- That's probably from Steven tag.

06:12.277 --> 06:15.546
- What?!
- It's a game where, when I tag one

06:15.614 --> 06:19.950
- of the gems, they ...
- I'm really not at the center of anything.

06:21.787 --> 06:23.554
I'm nothing.

06:31.363 --> 06:35.199
- What's wrong, Steven?
- I think I broke Ronaldo's heart.

06:35.267 --> 06:37.868
Oh, Steven. Humans
just lead short, boring,

06:37.869 --> 06:41.713
insignificant lives,
so they make up stories

06:41.748 --> 06:43.174
to feel like they're a
part of something bigger.

06:43.241 --> 06:45.426
They want to blame all
the world's problems

06:45.427 --> 06:47.611
on some single enemy
they can fight instead of

06:47.679 --> 06:51.282
a complex network of interrelated
forces beyond anyone's control.

06:51.349 --> 06:53.284
It's sad. And funny!

06:53.285 --> 06:55.767
Don't feel bad about it, okay?

06:55.768 --> 06:59.490
<i>It's not like he was
ever going to be right.</i>

07:03.195 --> 07:07.615
- Steven? Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go fix Ronaldo!

07:07.650 --> 07:10.484
I'll be back in an hour.

07:12.003 --> 07:14.505
Yo, Ronaldo!

07:16.981 --> 07:22.012
Eh, so...
See anything weird lately?

07:22.080 --> 07:27.318
No. Everything's normal.

07:27.385 --> 07:33.160
Snakemen are real, and we're
puppeting the gov'ment!

07:45.526 --> 07:48.283
Wakey wakey, mister snakey.

07:48.284 --> 07:52.499
Wave forms seem typical
for a 12th-Dimensional

07:52.500 --> 07:56.714
being of this size.
Arms appear to be... vestigial.

07:56.781 --> 07:58.799
R-Ronaldo? Is that...

07:58.800 --> 08:02.835
one of the monster people
you've been hunting?

08:02.870 --> 08:05.389
No, no, not monster, Peedee.

08:05.457 --> 08:09.660
Snerson.
It's very scientific! Still...

08:09.728 --> 08:12.819
- Better safe than sorry.
- What's this for?

08:12.820 --> 08:16.517
For me, in case the
amphibinoids turn my body

08:16.518 --> 08:18.602
- into a host vessel!
- Nooo!

08:18.670 --> 08:20.258
Peedee, Peedee, Peedee!

08:20.259 --> 08:22.640
You got to look at the big picture here!

08:22.741 --> 08:29.513
Something important is finally
happening to me!

08:29.581 --> 08:33.263
- Hello.
- We know you have our Steven!

08:33.298 --> 08:35.960
Give him up, curly!

08:37.937 --> 08:42.458
You snake people...
hiding like cowards in your

08:42.527 --> 08:44.435
false humanoid exteriors!

08:44.436 --> 08:47.298
Steven's got nothing to do with this!

08:47.365 --> 08:51.819
It's me you want! Ohh!

08:59.328 --> 09:02.313
You Snonster!

09:09.321 --> 09:10.847
Steven?!

09:12.805 --> 09:16.339
Okay, okay!
You've forced me to use my

09:16.374 --> 09:18.888
ultimate weapon! Stand back!

09:18.889 --> 09:25.235
Psychic ghost powers...
activate!

09:32.577 --> 09:37.885
- Everybody stop! I'm okay!
- Nice pants.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.018
Steven, your legs!
When did they get to you?

09:41.119 --> 09:48.437
Ronaldo! It's not real!
It was just me... again.

09:49.761 --> 09:52.129
That... makes no sense.

09:56.735 --> 10:00.437
I just wanted to inspire
Ronaldo to be weird again.

10:00.505 --> 10:03.224
No! It ... It just isn't that simple!

10:03.225 --> 10:05.943
There's got to be more to it

10:06.011 --> 10:13.183
- than just... you!
- Um...

10:13.251 --> 10:16.420
<i>But there is more!
Steven is just uh...</i>

10:16.421 --> 10:20.592
uh... a small piece of the puzzle.

10:20.627 --> 10:23.994
Look at this! I think it's
got to be... um...

10:24.062 --> 10:31.001
- level-8 beings pulling the strings.
- Get real, Peedee.

10:31.069 --> 10:36.407
Level-8 beings are a worker society
incapable of such organization.

10:36.508 --> 10:38.803
Whoa. Wait a minute!

10:38.804 --> 10:42.246
How did I never see this before?!

10:45.717 --> 10:49.066
I know what the diamond means.

10:49.067 --> 10:54.091
Polymorphic-sentient rocks!

10:54.192 --> 10:58.875
- You sure he'll be better like that?
- Yeah. He's happy, you know?

10:58.910 --> 11:03.279
<i>- Yeah.
- They're here to hollow out the Earth!</i>

11:03.314 --> 11:05.979
<i>It's part of
the great diamond authority!</i>

11:06.014 --> 11:08.324
<i>They'll take on any form!</i>
