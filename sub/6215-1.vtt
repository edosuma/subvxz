17:04.000 --> 17:05.200
Sarah Cook.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.040
Weren't you here last week?

17:19.160 --> 17:20.280
I'm here every week.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.960
POLICEMAN: All ID cards
on display with the picture
clearly visible!

18:00.040 --> 18:04.080
All ID cards on display
with the picture
clearly visible!

18:05.320 --> 18:07.080
Uh, I've lost my wallet.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.400
Must be down your sofa.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.240
Hand, now.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.680
Last name Green. Charlie Green.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.560
Sorry about that, sir.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.600
He called me "sir".
How cool is that?

18:40.640 --> 18:42.000
That's nothing.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.640
Someone called me
a "bloody Paki" yesterday.
How cool is that?

18:46.440 --> 18:48.680
CHARLIE: How exactly
is that cool?

18:48.800 --> 18:53.920
Old school insults
are making a comeback,
which I find reassuring.

18:54.040 --> 18:58.600
You should explain to your mum
that you find that term
completely unacceptable.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.240
Why do they do it?
Because they're politicians.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.760
What's up now?

19:02.880 --> 19:05.040
Wait till you hear
what Central Command
have sprung on us.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.120
-How's the head?
-Yeah, good, fine, raring to go.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.680
How about you?
On the painkillers already?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.680
No. I'm fine.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.360
The Prime Minister's visit
has been brought forward
by ten days.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.320
-That gives us exactly...
-Six hours.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.880
Six hours to prepare. Okay.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.360
Update me on the DNA tests
from the club.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.920
Have we ID'd Kylie's squeeze?

19:25.040 --> 19:28.040
Yeah, but it's not good news.
Theo Danakis.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.280
-Shit.
-Come on!

19:31.960 --> 19:34.080
Do whatever it takes
to get that info.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.640
-Who is he?
-Arms dealer.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.360
Specialises in supply
and disposal of arms
for big hits.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.000
The broker and the hoodie kid
from the warehouse?

19:41.120 --> 19:43.040
Hospitals still
given us nothing.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.920
Flynn Dixon got quite a whack,
though, he's gotta be getting
some treatment for it.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.320
I've spoke my assets.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.680
There's crackle about
Jermain Lee arriving in town.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.800
Jermain Lee is one of
the highest-paid mercenaries
in the country.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.920
So, we know of three of those
involved in this conspiracy.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.600
Kylie's little friend from
the club is Theo Danakis,
the arms dealer.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.160
Flynn Dixon hiding out
among the fruit and veg

20:06.280 --> 20:07.880
is the broker
organising the hit.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.720
But there is no hit
without an assassin,

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
we must get a visual
on Jermain Lee.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.640
The PM's definitely the target?

20:14.760 --> 20:17.880
It's rumours of a hit on the PM
that's put us on to our targets
in the first place.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.720
Jez - go and work your assets.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.000
What should I do?

20:21.120 --> 20:25.080
Come on,
you can be my lucky charm.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.520
MAN: Thought you were inside.
JEZ: Does it look like it?

20:29.080 --> 20:31.240
-Who's that?
-Don't worry about him.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.840
And don't look at him.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.520
He likes to fuck people up
if they look at him.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.360
-Serious?
-Jermain Lee... The hitman.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.520
I told you, I know nothing
about the geezer.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.760
You're lying...

20:43.880 --> 20:46.000
He can shoot the head
off a matchstick
from a mile away.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.360
We know that, obviously.
What else have you heard?

20:49.760 --> 20:52.600
He's Mr Particular.
Especially about food.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.480
Any other useful stuff?
Favourite colour, maybe?

20:55.600 --> 20:57.400
He's like, proper obsessed.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.520
Only eats burgers like,
and only a certain type.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.800
Organic meat, cooked
for X amount of minutes,
no sesame seeds on the bun,

21:04.920 --> 21:06.120
see what I'm saying?

21:07.960 --> 21:08.760
So how much is that worth, then?

21:09.880 --> 21:11.120
We'll let you off with a slap.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.120
We had such a connection
last night.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.640
I think we need
more time together.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.560
KYLIE: So, in brief,
who did you
last supply a weapon to?

21:28.760 --> 21:29.840
DANAKIS: What?

21:32.280 --> 21:34.520
Okay. Look normally,
this would be fun.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.200
But today, we're in a rush.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.760
I'm gonna ask you again.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.320
And if you don't tell me,

21:39.440 --> 21:42.600
my friend is gonna shoot you
in the big toe.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.600
Was it Jermain Lee?

21:51.080 --> 21:53.040
[SCREAMS] You fuck!

21:53.160 --> 21:55.440
You shot me!
You fucking shot me!
In the big toe.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.000
Yep. I did.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.920
Sorry. It's my fault,
I mustn't have been
clear enough.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.360
-You can't do this!
-Can't we?

22:00.480 --> 22:03.560
Didn't anybody tell you?
New world, new rules.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.800
-Next he'll shoot you
in the bollocks.
-No. Really?

22:05.920 --> 22:07.080
-You wouldn't.
-He's my bitch.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.520
-He does what he's told.
-You're bluffing!

22:09.640 --> 22:11.800
You thought I wouldn't
shoot you in the toe.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.520
Look what happened there.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.720
So I'd take that into account
when assessing your next move.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.320
It's a very simple question.

22:18.440 --> 22:23.480
Did you supply a great big gun
to an assassin called
Jermain Lee recently?

22:25.320 --> 22:26.760
Five seconds.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.040
Four.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.920
Three.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.080
Two...

22:34.360 --> 22:35.840
Danakis just got talkative.

22:35.960 --> 22:40.040
He provided Jermain Lee
with an AK47 Takedown
Sniper Rifle.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.520
Organic meat.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.560
Cheese on the relish.
No sesame seeds on the bun?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.240
I hate to sound impatient
but could we guarantee
the PM's safety

22:47.360 --> 22:48.520
before thinking about lunch?

22:48.640 --> 22:50.520
Jermain's anal about his food.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.160
Mr Particular,
my asset called him.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.000
And do you deliver yourselves?
Right. Right.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.200
Great. I'll tell the DFO we're
following a cast-iron lead.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.760
One second.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.920
I've got a take-away company
that has delivered a burger

23:02.040 --> 23:04.760
of exactly this description
for the last couple of nights.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.920
To a kid. No more than 15.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.120
The hoodie!
From the food warehouse?

23:11.120 --> 23:13.040
The hoodie is Jermain Lee.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.840
One of Britain's most feared
assassins is a 15-year-old kid
with a burger fetish?

23:16.960 --> 23:20.000
-Let's find him.
I'll talk to the DFO.
-Let's go.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.840
Hmm, DFO?

23:22.960 --> 23:26.680
Sarah Yates, Director
of Field Operations.
Hannah's boss.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.760
Okay. Does my expression
say to you I'm about to
pick up the phone

23:29.880 --> 23:31.880
and cancel the PM's visit?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.240
Just because one of my
Field Offices isn't up
to the job

23:34.360 --> 23:37.440
of protecting him
from a teenager?

23:37.560 --> 23:39.560
The age of the finger
that pulls the trigger

23:39.680 --> 23:43.040
makes little difference
to the impact of
a high-velocity bullet.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.200
24 hour delay,
that's all we need.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.400
In 24 hours he will be
in Edinburgh.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.800
They seem quite confident
they can protect him.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.120
If you'd stuck
to the original schedule,
we'd have them by now.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.960
If you don't think
I'll ask them to cancel,

23:55.080 --> 23:59.600
a correct assumption,
aren't we rather
wasting time here?

24:03.320 --> 24:07.080
I want it recorded
that I urged you
to postpone the visit.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.240
Do you know how many threats
to the PM we receive?

24:09.360 --> 24:11.800
Yes, but I believe
this is different.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.760
Everyone believes
their fears are different.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.080
Don't try and convince me
to cancel the visit.

Take it.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.320

more important than
this redundant conversation.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.800
You're making a mistake, Sarah.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.360

his tastes...

CCTV with a picture
from the compound.

-Which hotel?
-The Laurant. On the square.

24:39.680 --> 24:40.920
-Which square? <i>
-This square.</i>

24:41.040 --> 24:43.880
It's part of the convoy route.
Lee's in the room now.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.480
He's casing the shot.
Dry run. I'm on my way back.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.480
You need to secure
the hotel premises. Discreetly.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.480
Jermain Lee is not to know
we're onto him.

-He's in position too early.
-He's casing the shot.

why open the window,

31:30.520 --> 31:32.280
All right.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.800
That's how long
it'll take me to find somebody
in long trousers any way.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.240
Get on with it.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.680
Oh, God,
what did I just say?

31:47.800 --> 31:49.600
That's the Director
of Field Operations.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.960
Hannah's dead
and I just backchatted her.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.400
Not sure I can take
much more of this.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.960
Just while we're on it, why not
six hours? Or, I dunno, longer?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.360
She wouldn't have
given it to us.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.040
Five and a half
put her on the back foot.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.200
She was thinking more about
the "half" than the "five".

32:13.520 --> 32:16.520
Why would somebody shoot her?

32:22.320 --> 32:23.720
Why did he do that?

32:30.600 --> 32:33.480
Okay, what have
we got? Danakis...

32:33.600 --> 32:36.720
I don't think blowing off
another toe will get
much more out of him.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.240
He only supplied the weapon.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.920
To Jermain Lee,
who can't talk now either.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.160
There is the other guy
from the warehouse.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.920
Flynn Dixon,
if he is the broker,

32:46.040 --> 32:47.320
he's done the deal
with somebody.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.320
Find him we can follow
the money trail.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.040
We can't find him.
That's the problem.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.760
You need
medical attention.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.560
You can't check
your real name,
they'll nab you.

32:54.680 --> 32:55.920
What do you do?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.920
We checked out other staff.
No IDs were been used.

32:59.040 --> 33:02.000
Who else? Whose ID
was there and readily available?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.520
The security guards.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.960
When the heavies came down,
they killed the two guards.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.920
Let's find out their names
and go back to the hospitals.

33:10.040 --> 33:13.320
Bingo. Pete Grainger.
One of the security guards.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.320
Went to A&E last night,
then checked into
the Wellstone Clinic.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.240
I've heard very good things
about that place.

33:18.360 --> 33:21.440
It's the go-to clinic
when you've been blown to
smithereens with a shot-gun.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.800
Gotta be our guy.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.720
Fancy playing
Doctors and Nurses?

33:26.840 --> 33:27.960
[CHUCKLES] Not again.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.680
I'm here to run a few tests.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.960
Wait... What you doing?
That's got liquid in it!

33:40.080 --> 33:41.360
That's all right, just relax.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.520
Get off me!
Get off me!

33:42.640 --> 33:44.480
-Let the sedative do its job.
-Get off me!

33:48.920 --> 33:50.320
[CLATTERING]

33:50.440 --> 33:52.040
Good to see you've not
forgotten your medical training.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.320
Who are you? What do you want?

34:01.760 --> 34:03.280
Get up! Stand up!

34:06.120 --> 34:07.200
Down there.

34:14.240 --> 34:17.200
I'm here to collect
what's owed to us.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.880
I hear you're holding
the final instalment
of Jermain Lee's payment

34:20.000 --> 34:21.680
and I want that money now.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.440
Look at me. You fucking
keep looking at me
and you'll stay alive.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.760
-Where's the money?
-I haven't got it.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.640
I just set up the deal.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.320
I'm not interested.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.080
I want you to go and get me
the remaining fee,

34:33.200 --> 34:36.200
plus 50 grand compensation
for Jermain Lee's death.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.680
What do you mean, Lee's dead?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.520
You've got yourself in
way too deep here, Flynn.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.080
His target was an MI5 officer.

35:00.200 --> 35:05.040
They got to Lee and they threw
him from a building, and
my people want compensating.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.440
But I don't have the cash.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.800
There's one number
stored in this phone.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.120
You are going take it,

35:12.240 --> 35:15.960
you'll get me the remaining fee
plus the 50 grand compensation.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.560
You run...

35:20.080 --> 35:21.120
...you die.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.520
Tracking device is
in the phone, you should be
receiving the signal.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.040
The rest of the team
are en route for backup.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.920
Charlie, will you stop
bloody pacing?

35:38.040 --> 35:41.000
Sorry. One hour and 42 minutes
till we have to report back
to Yates.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.840
All units stay tight
on Flynn Dixon.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.600
He'll take us to whoever
commissioned the hit on Hannah.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.240
We got trouble.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.240
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:13.360 --> 36:15.480
FLYNN: Getting my balls squeezed
by Jermain Lee's people.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.760
They're demanding
extra money for his death.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.040
What?

36:20.160 --> 36:23.200
We've gotta go back
to them with something,
they're not messing about!

36:23.320 --> 36:25.840
They say we didn't give them
enough information
about the target.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.200
Who've you been talking to?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
Oh!

36:31.120 --> 36:34.400
You fucking idiot.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.240
You've brought them here,
haven't you?

36:42.160 --> 36:44.320
I've got a problem, MI5.
They've come for me.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.200
Get them off my back.
I need an intercept team.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
Target's in Longford Arcade.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.120
We play this low-key.
We can't afford
any civilian casualties.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.640
We surround the target,
take him when it's appropriate.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.600
This is stating the obvious,
but it's vital
we take him alive.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.720
He's our only link
to Hannah's death.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.880
Target heading upstairs.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.560
There! There! There!

37:47.000 --> 37:48.960
-Anyone got visual?
-Shit...

37:58.960 --> 38:02.480
Do whatever you have to.
Just get him alive.
We've lost him.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.880
Armed officers! Keep back!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.160
Put your weapon on the ground!

38:34.760 --> 38:36.680
I'm an ex-MI5 officer.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.400
You don't know
what you are getting in to.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.600
-We know a lot more
than you think.
-I doubt that.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.760
I advise you to walk away now!

38:42.880 --> 38:45.680
Place your weapon on the ground
and lie face down.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.680
No way!

41:02.200 --> 41:03.200
Oh, God...!

41:08.440 --> 41:12.800
Hannah and Mayhew
had history together,
personal and professional.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.000
I know he paid her
a visit here last night.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.240
You think this was personal?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.120
Seeing as you didn't
bring him in alive,
we'll never know.

41:20.240 --> 41:23.080
I certainly intend to find out.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.720
This brings me the issue
of Hannah's replacement.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.360
Rachel.
She's the obvious choice.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.840
Luckily, it's my choice.
And I don't do obvious.

41:33.640 --> 41:34.760
Then...

41:36.640 --> 41:39.000
No. No.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.040
I mean, I'm not...

41:42.160 --> 41:43.240
You need someone tougher.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.960
You stood up to me.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.040
Some might say that requires
a certain level of steel
in the balls.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.040
-The others...
-Good. That's a start.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.840
Referring to them
as "the others".

41:51.960 --> 41:54.280
If it makes you feel better
about it then we can
put "interim"

41:54.400 --> 41:55.840
in front of your job title?

41:58.360 --> 42:00.080
I do feel better
with "interim", actually.

42:00.200 --> 42:03.040
Interim team leader.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.680
Never forget that, though.
You have a good team.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.920
I'm relying on you, Charlie.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.960
What do you reckon?

42:18.080 --> 42:21.200
I'd be lying if I said
I'm not pissed off it I can't
boss you about.

42:21.320 --> 42:23.360
Yeah, but you don't need
a promotion to do that.

42:23.480 --> 42:26.320
But I'm not pissed off
it's Charlie. I'm pleased.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.520
Better the geek you know, right?

42:29.640 --> 42:32.400
Yes, but we don't exactly
know him though, do we?

42:32.520 --> 42:33.840
If I'm gonna take orders
from someone...

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
I've gotta respect them.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.400
I want us to find
Hannah's killer.

42:55.520 --> 42:59.440
More importantly,
I want to find out
why she was killed.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.640
Everyone involved is dead
apart from Flynn
so I reckon we go back to him

43:02.760 --> 43:04.320
and shake him about a bit more.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.320
News came through
while you were with Yates.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.400
Flynn's dead.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.080
Topped himself before
we could ask a single question.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.720
Somebody got to him as well.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.320
Every possible tongue
has now been silenced.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.040
So what now?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.320
-Charlie Green?
-You know my name?

43:44.440 --> 43:46.520
Hannah asked me
to give you this.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.880
She was killed today
so unless something weird
is happening...

43:49.000 --> 43:51.480
She asked me to give
it to you if she died.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.280
-That makes me curious
about who you are.
-An old friend.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.680
I don't know what this is.
I don't want to know.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.080
I'm just doing
what Hannah asked.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.040
Now I have, I'm done.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.320
I need to show you something.

44:23.440 --> 44:27.160
<i>If you're watching this,
I must be dead.</i>

44:27.280 --> 44:31.440
<i>Which probably means
they got to me <i>
before I got to them.</i></i>

44:31.560 --> 44:33.320
CHARLIE: What about
the investigation
into Hannah's death.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.000
I was thinking
there must be several lines...

44:35.120 --> 44:36.360
It's all in hand
at Central Command.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.720
I need you to focus on
Field Office 19. Nothing more.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.840
It's Julian Nelson.
We were training to be doctors.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.280
I'm afraid he's dead.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.880
Why did you do that?

44:52.400 --> 44:54.840
This is
pentetate calcium trisodium.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.680
This helps remove
the radioactive elements
of plutonium from my blood.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.720
The radiation
is slowly killing me.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.600
Doesn't it scare you?

45:02.720 --> 45:04.280
Yeah, fucking terrifies me.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.760
I'm not ready to die.

45:05.880 --> 45:09.080
Oh, you have a visitor.
A policeman, DS Phillips.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.920
He was asking a lot of questions
about you.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.720
Are you a suspect?

45:12.840 --> 45:16.320
They think I might know
something but I've told them
everything I know.

45:16.440 --> 45:19.080
It's against the rules, is it?
Shagging an informer?

45:20.080 --> 45:21.480
Just a bit.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.880
So why are you doing it?

45:24.000 --> 45:25.160
'Cause you got beautiful eyes.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.360
What would they do to you
if they found out about us?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.120
You still think
that Julia's death
was a suicide?

45:34.240 --> 45:36.960
Do you remember where you were
between 12.30 and 1.00?

45:37.080 --> 45:39.240
I think everyone remembers
where you were on that day.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.000
Did you do it?
Did you kill that man?

45:41.120 --> 45:42.520
-What? No!
-Did you?

45:42.640 --> 45:44.400
Honestly, no!

45:47.360 --> 45:49.760
We need to speak to this guy,
Dr Abid Malik.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.680
The scientist Blackwell
was talking about?

45:51.800 --> 45:54.360
He's been held
in Camp Windsmere
for the last ten months.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.080
If I get caught, you know
they'll come looking for you.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.760
Just don't get caught.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.320
I want to ask you
some questions.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.080
Did you help plant the bomb
that blew up London
eleven months ago?

46:05.800 --> 46:07.640
<i>There's a traitor within MI5.</i>

46:07.760 --> 46:10.760
<i>I believe this person
is directly responsible <i>
for the attack on London.</i></i>

46:10.880 --> 46:12.600
I'm working for MI5.
Who're you working for?

46:12.720 --> 46:13.800
I can't talk about it.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.400
-Let me come with you.
-No.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.200
I already have
radiation sickness.
It makes sense.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.000
Can't ask anyone else to go.
Not to London.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.880
I have to do this.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.280
You're taking
this seriously, eh?

46:23.400 --> 46:25.600
I mean, a joke's a joke,
if anything goes wrong...

46:25.720 --> 46:28.000
Piss off, Charlie.
Stop acting like their dad.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.680
Shut up, Rob. At least he cares.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.720
KYLIE: If he screws this up,
he's gonna land us all in shit.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.320
RACHEL: Give him a break.
It can't be easy
taking over like that.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.960
Oh my god,
you fancy him, don't you?

46:44.080 --> 46:46.280
We are not having
this conversation.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.640
Rob wouldn't be happy about it.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.560
ROB: I care for you, Rachel.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.840
Just leave it.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.440
Of course. Charlie.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.680
Do you love him?

46:59.960 --> 47:02.360
-You don't know
who you can trust.
-I trust you.

[SCREAMS]

47:06.760 --> 47:10.040
Don't make me look
like a dickhead, ever.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.560
We've got to wipe the bastards
off the map.

47:11.680 --> 47:14.160
There's thousands
of innocent civilians in there.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.280
We can handle
a bit of collateral damage.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.640
Go!

47:19.760 --> 47:22.960
If someone did set up Malik
over the London bomb,
then they also killed Hannah

47:23.080 --> 47:24.640
because she found out.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.200
You messed up, Jez.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.920
I'll do whatever I have to
to put it right.

47:28.840 --> 47:30.080
Tell me, where is she.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.920
Where is she?

47:34.960 --> 47:36.520
Don't ever lie to me again.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.080
[GUN SHOTS FIRING]

47:39.920 --> 47:41.440
[MEN SCREAMING]

47:47.000 --> 47:48.240
Who's funding you?

47:48.360 --> 47:50.040
CIA? Al Qaeda?

47:50.160 --> 47:52.440
You should be very careful
about threatening me.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.800
You need to figure
the next attack could be
even worse.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.040
They claim the ringleaders
were killed in the explosion.

47:57.160 --> 47:58.320
I know that's a lie.

47:58.440 --> 47:59.720
MAN: We're the MI5.

48:01.800 --> 48:04.360
Military action
on British civilans
will not look good.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.400
People will die.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.600
Can you tell me who they are?

48:18.880 --> 48:21.200
ROB: Who gives up being
a mathematician for MI5?

48:21.320 --> 48:22.880
It's a weird choice.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.480
And giving up
on your doctor to join MI5,
is it a weird choice?

48:25.600 --> 48:27.960
Hey, I just want to
save the world.

48:31.880 --> 48:34.080
We can't risk MI5 finding out
we know anything.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.960
When we get
to the admissions area,
I need you to chew down.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.120
They've got to see that
they've got a real emergency.

48:39.240 --> 48:41.200
Please, you've got to let us...

48:41.320 --> 48:45.840
One day before memorial day,
and we lose the chief suspect
from the London bombings.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.920
To have Dr Abid Malik

48:48.040 --> 48:50.760
broken out of Camp Windsmere
now is catastrophic.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.960
MAN: They cannot be
underestimated.

48:53.080 --> 48:56.480
Everything that's happened,
everything that's going
to happen,

48:56.600 --> 48:59.480
they have been planning it
for a long time.
