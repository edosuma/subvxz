01:34.861 --> 01:37.261
Everyone inside now!

01:42.335 --> 01:45.007
Lucinda,
we're going in.

01:46.372 --> 01:47.703
Lucinda!

01:49.576 --> 01:51.840
Lucinda,
we're going in.

01:53.246 --> 01:54.474
Lucinda!

01:59.486 --> 02:03.616
Now, you remember tomorrow
is our official opening day, don't you?

02:03.690 --> 02:05.954
- Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor.

02:06.025 --> 02:09.358
And you remember Principal Clark
ran a competition last month

02:09.429 --> 02:14.059
to find the best ideas to celebrate
this very special day.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.625
- Me! Me! Me!
- Me! Me! Me!

02:16.703 --> 02:20.799
Well, yesterday,
the staff selected the winning idea,

02:20.874 --> 02:24.105
and it came from this class.

02:25.912 --> 02:29.575
The winner is our own

02:30.617 --> 02:32.312
Lucinda Embry.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.216
Lucinda?
- Why her?

02:34.287 --> 02:35.754
Lucinda?
- Lucinda?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.551
Come on, everyone.

02:40.527 --> 02:45.760
We'll be closing our dedication ceremony
with the burial of a time capsule.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.931
- Yes?
- What's a time capsule?

02:57.510 --> 03:00.001
This is a time capsule.

03:00.079 --> 03:02.513
Wow.
- That's incredible.

03:02.582 --> 03:05.551
Now, I need you
to put your thinking caps on,

03:05.618 --> 03:08.086
because I want each of you to draw

03:08.154 --> 03:11.612
what you think the future
is going to look like.

03:11.691 --> 03:15.491
Then we'll put the pictures in the capsule,
and 50 years from today,

03:15.562 --> 03:21.057
a group of children just like yourselves
will open it up to see what you drew.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.702
Doesn't that sound exciting?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.965
- Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.563
Let's begin.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.538
That is a lovely spaceship there, Dawn.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.945
Thank you, Miss Taylor.
- Well done.

03:36.015 --> 03:39.075
And that is a nice robot, Andrew.
Very good.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.354
Time's up. Everyone hand your work in.

03:43.423 --> 03:46.358
And make sure you write your name
on the envelope.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.450
My name's over here.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.495
Thank you, Harold.
- Thank you, Miss Taylor.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.553
Lucinda, you need to finish up now.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.622
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.034
Oh, Lucinda.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.802
The assignment was to draw a picture.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.640
This was your idea.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.920
Okay, I want you all to finish, please.

04:22.128 --> 04:26.189
<i>Welcome to all</i>
<i>our friends and esteemed colleagues.</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:31.431
<i>We, the students and faculty</i>
<i>of William Dawes Elementary,</i>

04:31.504 --> 04:36.305
<i>hereby bury this time capsule</i>
<i>in dedication of our new school,</i>

04:37.243 --> 04:39.211
<i>and we charge our descendents</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:43.909
<i>to open this vault of history</i>
<i>50 years from today.</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:48.948
<i>To the future and the promise that it holds.</i>

05:34.867 --> 05:36.129
Lucinda?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.300
Lucinda?

05:39.205 --> 05:40.536
Lucinda?

05:40.606 --> 05:44.133
I'm certain Lucinda
is simply being over curious.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.073
Can you please help find her?

05:48.147 --> 05:50.547
The cloakroom. Check the cloakroom.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.811
Lucinda. Henry, come on.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.246
- Lucinda?
- Come on out now.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.914
Lucinda?

05:57.990 --> 05:59.457
Lucinda?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.410
Lucinda.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.145
Oh, my God.

06:29.021 --> 06:33.253
Make them stop.
Please make them stop whispering.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.880
Caleb? Take a look at this.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.016
There you go.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.556
What is it?

08:52.632 --> 08:55.294
Saturn's rings await your approval.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.769
Has anyone found life on other planets?

08:59.839 --> 09:03.172
Not yet. Guess it's just us for now.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.075
Okay.
Then how many that might have life?

09:09.148 --> 09:14.518
Well, if you count the number of stars
similar to our sun in this galaxy,

09:14.587 --> 09:18.614
then you factor in the probability that
they have Earth-like planets orbiting them...

09:18.691 --> 09:20.625
There are 10 million possible worlds

09:20.693 --> 09:24.129
with four million mature enough
for life to evolve.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.526
Why do you even ask?

09:27.600 --> 09:30.330
Just making sure if you're listening.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.999
- Where you going?
- To watch that Discovery program.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.600
But it's Dad's famous Sunday night
hot dogs on the run...

09:38.578 --> 09:39.567
...time.

09:39.645 --> 09:43.308
I can't consume that.
I've decided to become a vegetarian.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.111
Well, when were you planning on
telling the guy

09:45.184 --> 09:47.448
who buys the groceries around here?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.648
Are you deaf? I just told you now, Dad.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.862
<i>The cubs are now</i>
<i>six months old and bounding with energy,</i>

09:57.930 --> 10:02.333
<i>but, any parent knows,</i>
<i>this is also a mixed blessing.</i>

10:03.636 --> 10:07.072
- Off.
- No, it's almost over.

10:07.139 --> 10:10.836
You're not gonna be able to concentrate
in class tomorrow.

10:11.243 --> 10:15.407
I don't have class tomorrow.
It's the 50th anniversary, remember?

10:16.582 --> 10:18.015
I remember.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.484
Caleb,

10:28.127 --> 10:31.255
when I said it was just us out there,

10:31.330 --> 10:34.595
you know I was talking
about space, right?

10:34.667 --> 10:37.898
I didn't mean heaven, or anything.

10:37.970 --> 10:42.498
- I'm sure wherever Mom is...
- Dad, you don't even believe in heaven.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.768
I never said that, Caleb.

10:47.847 --> 10:51.874
I just said we can't
know for sure, that's all.

10:52.852 --> 10:56.845
If you want to believe,
you go ahead and believe, okay?

10:58.858 --> 11:00.416
Okay. Bedtime.

11:08.934 --> 11:12.961
Hey, you and me,

11:13.039 --> 11:15.872
- together forever.
- Forever.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.478
I love you.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.275
I love you, too.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.708
We're going to pose a topic

12:30.783 --> 12:33.752
to get you thinking along the right lines
for your term paper.

12:33.819 --> 12:38.779
It's the subject of randomness
versus determinism in the universe.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.883
Who's jumping in? Jessica?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.827
Determinism says
that occurrences in nature

12:43.896 --> 12:47.889
are causally decided by preceding events
or natural laws,

12:47.967 --> 12:51.334
that everything leading up to this point
has happened for a reason.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.429
That's right.
That's what determinism says.

12:58.911 --> 13:02.608
Spencer? Tell me something about the sun.

13:02.681 --> 13:03.670
It's hot.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.045
Elaborate.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.848
Temperature's about 10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit on the surface,

13:08.921 --> 13:11.685
- 27 million degrees at the core.
- Good.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.089
Stacey?

13:17.163 --> 13:19.757
A word or two about the composition.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.299
Mostly hydrogen.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.495
Also helium with some carbon
and nitrogen thrown in there.

13:24.570 --> 13:29.803
Excellent. Now, I want you to think
about the perfect set of circumstances

13:29.875 --> 13:32.935
that put this celestial ball of fire

13:34.346 --> 13:38.715
at just the correct distance

13:41.620 --> 13:45.522
from our little blue
planet for life to evolve,

13:45.591 --> 13:48.890
making it possible for you to be
sitting here in this riveting lecture.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.027
But that's a nice thought, right?

13:52.097 --> 13:57.057
Everything has a purpose, an order to it,
is determined.

13:58.971 --> 14:02.134
But then there's the other side
of the argument,

14:04.043 --> 14:09.777
the theory of randomness,
which says it's all simply coincidence.

14:11.083 --> 14:16.111
The very fact we exist is nothing
but the result of a complex

14:16.188 --> 14:19.715
yet inevitable string
of chemical accidents

14:20.960 --> 14:23.053
and biological mutations.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.425
There is no grand meaning.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.399
There's no purpose.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.808
What about you,
Professor Koestler?

14:48.354 --> 14:51.289
- What?
- Well, what do you believe?

14:54.593 --> 14:57.323
I think shit just happens.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.758
But that's me. Class dismissed.

15:06.405 --> 15:10.364
Now, that's some very heavy shit
for a Monday morning, by the sounds of it.

15:10.442 --> 15:14.242
Since when does the cosmology
department audit my lectures?

15:14.313 --> 15:18.147
Since my esteemed colleague
in astrophysics owes me a latte.

15:21.053 --> 15:24.250
So what's on
your scientific mind today?

15:24.323 --> 15:28.783
Do you remember Kim's little sister?
Ph-double D's? Remember her?

15:28.861 --> 15:31.557
Is it ethical to say things like that
about your sister-in-law?

15:31.630 --> 15:35.828
What? It's factual. It's peer-reviewed.
I mean, it's like... Anyway, whatever.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.698
- She's in town this Friday.
- Okay.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.762
And she thinks that you're intriguing,
which I thought was code for gay,

15:40.839 --> 15:45.401
but apparently not because she's asked
if you would join us for dinner.

15:47.413 --> 15:50.507
- Yeah, I... I don't know, Phil.
- Come on, John.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.915
Come on, you owe me for last time
you skipped out on me.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.147
- Caleb was panicking.
- Yeah, look, I know.

15:56.221 --> 15:58.314
And the time before that,
he had a sore throat.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.153
- Oh, no.
- What?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.523
- Damn it! Damn it!
- What?

16:02.594 --> 16:05.358
Caleb's ceremony. I'm sorry, Phil.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.456
Hey! Hey! Friday!

16:07.533 --> 16:09.364
I'll think about it!

16:11.370 --> 16:13.600
<i>- This little light of mine</i>
<i>- This little light of mine</i>

16:13.672 --> 16:16.266
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine</i>
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

16:16.342 --> 16:18.776
<i>- This little light of mine</i>
<i>- This little light of mine</i>

16:18.844 --> 16:21.369
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine</i>
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

16:21.447 --> 16:23.847
<i>- This little light of mine</i>
<i>- This little light of mine</i>

16:23.916 --> 16:25.747
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine</i>
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

16:25.818 --> 16:30.881
<i>- Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>
<i>- Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

16:36.261 --> 16:41.563
<i>Fifty years ago, the students and faculty</i>
<i>of William Dawes Elementary</i>

16:41.633 --> 16:44.898
<i>imagined what the future might hold.</i>

16:44.970 --> 16:48.201
<i>Today, we unveil their legacy.</i>

16:48.273 --> 16:51.640
<i>Now, I'd like to introduce you</i>
<i>to someone very special,</i>

16:51.710 --> 16:53.701
<i>Miss Priscilla Taylor.</i>

16:56.448 --> 16:59.178
<i>Since Miss Taylor was there</i>
<i>for the original dedication,</i>

16:59.251 --> 17:03.051
<i>it's only fitting that we have her</i>
<i>do the honors today.</i>

17:23.409 --> 17:24.808
Wow!

17:34.019 --> 17:36.146
You almost forgot again.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.885
I made it in time to hear you sing.
You were the best one up there.

17:40.959 --> 17:44.861
- You could not hear me.
- I could. I swear.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.200
Gotta go. They're starting!

17:50.269 --> 17:52.134
All right, easy, easy!
No pushing.

17:52.204 --> 17:55.105
Everyone is going to receive an envelope.

17:59.044 --> 18:02.810
Open them gently now. They're very old.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.611
Miss Taylor! Miss Taylor!

18:10.122 --> 18:11.521
Thank you.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.657
Everyone's gonna get one.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.169
- Hello again, John.
- Hello. How's it going?

19:01.707 --> 19:03.231
Hey, what'd you get?

19:03.308 --> 19:06.573
Boring.
Everyone else got a picture.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.132
Caleb, could you please watch
where you put this?

19:28.200 --> 19:31.465
I don't want you to lose another one.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.767
It's making funny noises.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.137
Try turning the volume down.

19:39.645 --> 19:43.103
Hey, Dad? You know that kid, Jason,
from soccer practice?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.206
Mmm-hmm.

19:44.283 --> 19:48.413
He's having a sleepover this weekend,
and he was wondering if I can come.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.148
Sounds like fun.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.712
They have a boat.

19:51.790 --> 19:55.282
Jason's dad said he might take us out
on the lake.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.088
I'll think about it.

19:58.163 --> 20:01.530
- That means no.
- It means I'll think about it.

20:07.072 --> 20:10.007
What are you doing with this?

20:10.075 --> 20:12.737
You weren't supposed to bring this home.
It belongs to the school.

20:12.811 --> 20:17.612
But maybe it means something,
like a math puzzle or something like that.

20:17.683 --> 20:21.244
Yeah, that's good, I don't know,
but it's not ours to keep.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.051
Now, you return this as soon
as you get to school tomorrow. Got it?

20:25.123 --> 20:27.284
Okay, let's go. Bedtime.

20:41.907 --> 20:47.402
<i>O'er thy spirit gently stealing</i>

20:51.183 --> 20:57.053
<i>I my loving vigil keeping</i>

20:57.122 --> 21:01.957
<i>All through the night</i>

21:05.897 --> 21:07.694
<i>Goodnight, baby.</i>

21:08.667 --> 21:10.294
Goodnight, Mom.

21:33.392 --> 21:37.294
<i>Our tigress lives</i>
<i>in Kanha National Park,</i>

21:37.362 --> 21:39.626
<i>in the forests of Kipling's</i> Jungle Book,

21:40.565 --> 21:42.726
<i>where dawn elephant patrols</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:45.634
<i>ensure this is one of the safest places</i>
<i>for tigers to roam.</i>

21:49.508 --> 21:51.305
<i>Year after year...</i>

22:03.789 --> 22:05.154
Damn it.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.313
9l11l01.

23:38.683 --> 23:42.084
Two thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-six.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.323
Come on.

23:49.694 --> 23:51.594
What the hell is this?

25:20.085 --> 25:22.713
<i>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina...</i>

25:22.787 --> 25:25.620
<i>There could be</i>
<i>thousands of bodies here...</i>

25:38.003 --> 25:39.595
Oh, my God.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.068
Dad?

25:48.914 --> 25:51.041
Dad, we're gonna be late!

25:57.856 --> 26:00.290
Do you have your knapsack all set?

26:02.994 --> 26:05.554
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Koestler.

26:06.197 --> 26:08.859
Dad, are you sick?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.099
I'm fine.

26:11.169 --> 26:14.195
Don't you think you're acting
kind of awkward today?

26:14.272 --> 26:18.538
Am I awkward?
I just had a lot of work to do last night.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.038
Okay.

26:21.947 --> 26:24.074
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

26:31.523 --> 26:32.547
Look at this.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.558
- Look at the numbers beside the date.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.059
Two thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-six.

26:36.127 --> 26:37.151
Right.

26:37.228 --> 26:38.786
That's how many people died
in the attacks that day.

26:38.863 --> 26:39.955
- Yeah.
- All right, stay with me.

26:40.031 --> 26:43.194
I know how this sounds, but I've matched
these numbers to the dates

26:43.268 --> 26:48.069
of every major global disaster for
the last 50 years in perfect sequence,

26:48.139 --> 26:49.401
except for three.

26:49.474 --> 26:52.671
And these events haven't occurred yet,
starting with this one.

26:52.744 --> 26:55.907
So tomorrow, somewhere on the planet,
this number string predicts

26:55.981 --> 27:00.918
that 81 people are gonna die
in some kind of tragedy.

27:00.986 --> 27:04.922
- Whoa. I mean, have a listen to yourself.
- I know.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.457
- It sounds pretty crazy.
- I know.

27:06.524 --> 27:08.583
I mean, even for you.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.094
- What's this?
- Open it.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.732
Oh!

27:22.974 --> 27:24.771
Why are you showing me this?

27:24.843 --> 27:29.177
The day Allison died in the fire,
it's on the list, too,

27:29.914 --> 27:34.442
from a piece of paper that's been
buried in the ground for five decades.

27:35.186 --> 27:37.677
- Yeah.
- Can you explain that, Phil?

27:38.657 --> 27:41.785
I was up all night going over this.
I went through that list again and again,

27:41.860 --> 27:44.761
and I tried to fault it and I couldn't.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.127
Maybe someone's playing
a really shitty joke...

27:47.198 --> 27:51.157
Right! Right!
Except I saw them dig it up!

27:53.204 --> 27:55.263
I watched them pull the capsule
out of the ground

27:55.340 --> 27:57.365
and hand that sealed envelope to my kid.

27:57.442 --> 27:59.740
Okay, let me ask you this, then.

27:59.811 --> 28:02.143
All these uncircled numbers,
what do they mean?

28:02.213 --> 28:04.340
I don't know yet. Maybe nothing.
But the circled...

28:04.416 --> 28:06.816
Maybe they all mean nothing.

28:06.885 --> 28:09.718
Okay, Phil, hey,
can we just start over here?

28:09.788 --> 28:13.622
I'm not saying that 81 people
are going to die tomorrow, okay?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.252
I'm just trying to understand
why this is saying they will.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.989
Okay, it's spooky, all right? I'll grant you.
It's more than spooky.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.588
But just step back, all right?

28:20.665 --> 28:23.793
You have all these uncircled numbers
with no sequence to them.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.996
I mean, numerology,
kabala, Pythagorean cults,

28:27.072 --> 28:29.768
there are systems
that find meaning in numbers,

28:29.841 --> 28:32.241
and they are a dime a dozen. Why?

28:32.310 --> 28:35.711
Because people see
what they want to see in them.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.343
I mean,
that's really what you think I'm doing?

28:40.418 --> 28:43.649
Yeah, I think that losing Allison
has spun you off your axis a little,

28:43.722 --> 28:46.520
and I think it's clouded your judgment.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.625
I'm just saying it's
clouded your judgment.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.461
Don't you think?

28:57.335 --> 28:59.929
- Where are you going?
- Off campus.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.691
Yes?

29:25.630 --> 29:27.564
But you do remember her?

29:27.632 --> 29:31.568
Oh, yes. I remember Lucinda.

29:33.404 --> 29:36.805
She was such a sad little girl.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.583
Would you like some iced tea?

29:46.651 --> 29:49.552
Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you.

29:50.722 --> 29:55.455
Do you remember the day your students
buried the time capsule?

29:55.527 --> 29:58.792
Oh, yes.
The children were so excited.

29:58.863 --> 30:00.831
And what about Lucinda?

30:02.100 --> 30:05.194
That was the day we couldn't find her.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.535
She was hiding in a closet,
under the gym,

30:08.606 --> 30:13.373
scratching at the door with her
fingernails like some kind of animal.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.869
Scratching at the door?

30:17.081 --> 30:20.710
- Why was she hiding?
- I'm not sure.

30:20.785 --> 30:24.050
She was holding up the class
writing all those silly numbers.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.420
I had to hurry her along.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.593
Then we found her,

30:29.661 --> 30:33.222
and I knew something had frightened
the poor dear,

30:33.298 --> 30:36.927
but we never could get her
to tell us what it was.

30:37.001 --> 30:42.303
Miss Taylor, my son got
Lucinda's time capsule message.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.401
Do you remember this?
Is this what she wrote?

30:48.479 --> 30:53.246
Oh, Professor, you
are testing an old woman's memory.

30:53.318 --> 30:56.879
- Can you believe it's been 50 years?
- It's a long time.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.320
I believe that's it.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.290
How rude of me.

31:10.468 --> 31:15.565
I never offered you a drink.
Would you like some iced tea?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.904
No, thank you. I'm fine.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.171
I thought maybe I could meet her.

31:20.245 --> 31:25.273
Oh! I'm sorry.
Lucinda passed away several years ago.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.816
I said I'm Caleb Koestler's father.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.825
I'm calling to find out
the names of the two janitors

31:34.893 --> 31:39.330
that pulled the time capsule out
of the ground yesterday at the ceremony.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.252
I'm not sure I understand
why that would be a problem for you.

32:06.524 --> 32:10.187
<i>Yes, sir, we're afraid that</i>
<i>that's privileged information.</i>

32:22.840 --> 32:24.102
Caleb!

32:27.578 --> 32:30.809
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Just some guys.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.047
What did he give you?

32:33.117 --> 32:35.608
Just this. Kind of cool, isn't it?

32:40.892 --> 32:43.759
What did I say about
talking to strangers?

32:44.495 --> 32:45.723
Have you done your homework?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.196
Give me 10 more minutes of practice.

32:47.265 --> 32:50.792
I don't want to have to ask you twice,
Caleb. Come on.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.642
Hey!

33:12.490 --> 33:13.684
Hey, stranger.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.454
At what age do we learn to knock?

33:16.527 --> 33:20.019
I said I was going to drop by on my way
to the graveyard shift, remember?

33:20.098 --> 33:22.328
- Didn't you get my message?
- I've been busy.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.130
Can you not play with my things?

33:25.203 --> 33:28.536
- You're always busy.
- Yes! Yes.

33:31.909 --> 33:34.901
How's my nephew?
- Decided to become a vegetarian.

33:34.979 --> 33:37.641
A what?
- Why, you got a problem with that?

33:37.715 --> 33:42.243
You're not feeding him Dad's famous
Sunday night hot dogs again, are you?

33:43.187 --> 33:45.985
You know, if you want someone to take him
off your hands for the evening

33:46.057 --> 33:48.491
so you can go out, you know,
like normal people do...

33:48.559 --> 33:50.754
I appreciate the offer, but we're fine.

33:50.828 --> 33:53.763
And, believe it or not, Caleb and
I have got a good thing going here.

33:53.831 --> 33:54.820
Uh-huh?

33:54.899 --> 33:58.426
Yeah. So you can report
that back to headquarters.

33:58.669 --> 34:01.160
Mom says hi. So does Dad.

34:01.973 --> 34:05.101
Grace, don't.

34:07.478 --> 34:09.639
I get that you don't like
being the son of a pastor.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.806
I am the son of a pastor.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.475
That's fine.

34:13.551 --> 34:17.817
- You're still his son. Can't you let it go?
- Can't he?

34:17.889 --> 34:20.516
You know he asks after you
every time I see him.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.991
- He worries about you.
- He said that?

34:23.061 --> 34:25.255
- He doesn't have to.
- Right.

34:27.231 --> 34:30.132
You're going to have to speak to him
one day, you know.

34:30.201 --> 34:32.065
This can't go on forever.

34:32.136 --> 34:34.331
You know it's what Allison wanted,

34:34.405 --> 34:37.737
for Caleb to have a grandfather,
and vice versa.

34:40.945 --> 34:43.413
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

34:44.482 --> 34:47.542
By the way, Grace, how are you?
How's your life? What's going on for you?

34:47.618 --> 34:50.815
- Thank you, John, for asking.
- I have to get up early in the morning.

34:50.888 --> 34:52.856
What have you got going on?
I'll say a prayer.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.289
Please...

34:55.726 --> 34:57.284
Don't.

34:57.361 --> 34:58.623
Okay.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.159
<i>And at the ASX 200 index in Australia,</i>

36:41.599 --> 36:44.432
You're on carpool this afternoon.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.197
Caleb, I am so sorry.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.999
I'll pick you up in 10 minutes. Okay?

36:50.074 --> 36:51.735
Okay. Bye.

37:05.189 --> 37:09.148

37:15.433 --> 37:18.732
<i>We can't get to the phone right now,</i>
<i>so please leave a message.</i>

37:18.803 --> 37:20.896
Hey, Phil, it's John.

37:23.374 --> 37:25.467
I'm sorry about yesterday.

37:25.543 --> 37:28.637
I kind of freaked out on you, didn't I?

37:29.880 --> 37:34.681
Well, look, I'm not ready to meet anyone
in any kind of special way, you know,

37:34.752 --> 37:39.052
but I would like to take you up
on your offer for dinner.

37:40.358 --> 37:46.024
I think it would be good for me to just,
you know, get out of the house and...

38:06.751 --> 38:09.413
The uncircled numbers are locations.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.918
This location.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.570
Get back in your vehicles.
We'll clear this up in a minute.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.273
Get these people back in their cars!

38:38.916 --> 38:41.248
We can open up the far lane.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.154
What's going on?
Can we get through or what?

38:47.425 --> 38:49.791
Hi. Is everything okay?

38:49.860 --> 38:52.055
I'm sorry, sir,
but you need to get back to your car.

38:52.129 --> 38:55.895
- Anybody hurt?
- A couple of injuries, but nothing serious.

38:58.402 --> 39:01.235
Get down! Get away!

39:41.379 --> 39:43.313
Hey! Hey!

40:12.209 --> 40:15.542
Help me! Please!

40:15.613 --> 40:18.013
Help me!

40:18.082 --> 40:21.677
Help me, please! Help me!

40:55.853 --> 40:57.411
Are you okay, sir?

40:57.488 --> 40:59.581
Step back, sir. Step away.

<i>that a malfunction in the navigational</i>
<i>systems of the planes caused the crashes...</i>

41:49.373 --> 41:52.342
- You didn't tell him anything?
- Of course not.

41:52.409 --> 41:56.436
<i>First estimates put</i>
<i>the presumed dead at 81.</i>

What happened, Dad? What's going on?

42:22.773 --> 42:25.207
Truck broke down on the highway.

42:34.018 --> 42:36.350
It's more than that, isn't it?

42:38.822 --> 42:40.517
I'm going to bed.

42:43.327 --> 42:45.295
Get your homework done.

42:46.564 --> 42:50.694
And you should go to bed, too.
No TV tonight.

42:50.768 --> 42:55.034
- Why? I always watch an hour of TV.
- No more questions, Caleb.

42:55.105 --> 42:59.064
I can ask questions when you tell me
things to do that don't make sense.

42:59.143 --> 43:02.670
You won't let me play soccer,
you won't let me stay over at Jason's,

43:02.746 --> 43:04.680
and now you won't tell me what's going on

43:04.748 --> 43:08.377
and why you're acting
so weird all the time.

43:08.452 --> 43:10.386
I'm not a kid anymore.

43:52.062 --> 43:56.362
Oh, my God. John, you... You were there?

43:58.569 --> 44:04.701
The date, the number of dead,
the GPS coordinates, lat and long.

44:04.775 --> 44:08.370
- Why didn't I see that?
- It wasn't coincidence.

44:08.445 --> 44:11.937
I drove past at the exact moment
the prediction came true.

44:12.016 --> 44:13.142
It's not coincidence.

44:13.217 --> 44:15.742
Okay, John, I didn't say it was.

44:18.288 --> 44:21.155
So what are we calling this?
Synchronicity?

44:21.225 --> 44:25.958
Two unrelated events,
digging up a time capsule, plane crash,

44:26.030 --> 44:29.830
combined to create a significance
for the subject, you?

44:29.900 --> 44:32.300
I keep seeing their faces,

44:34.204 --> 44:35.535
burning.

44:38.308 --> 44:39.639
Oh, man.

44:42.079 --> 44:45.981
Okay, look.
We're way beyond the bounds here, John.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.540
We don't have a frame of reference.

44:47.618 --> 44:51.076
There could be multiple meanings
to consider.

44:51.155 --> 44:53.419
There are two disasters left.

44:54.258 --> 44:55.748
What are you saying?

44:55.826 --> 45:01.992
The numbers are warnings meant for me.

45:02.533 --> 45:05.730
They might just as easily
be a warning to stay away.

45:05.803 --> 45:08.465
You could have been killed today, John.
Caleb would have been orphaned,

45:08.539 --> 45:11.133
and you want to go put yourself
back in harm's way?

45:11.208 --> 45:13.039
Two disasters left.

45:21.185 --> 45:26.122
Right now my scientific mind is telling me
to have nothing more to do with this,

45:26.924 --> 45:28.892
and yours should, too.

48:01.678 --> 48:04.044
Dad!

48:14.324 --> 48:16.656
Caleb, what's wrong? What's wrong?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.194
Dad!

48:18.262 --> 48:20.822
It's okay. It's okay.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.991
It's just a bad dream.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.471
It's just a bad dream.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.214
Hey!

48:51.828 --> 48:52.988
Hey!

48:54.331 --> 48:56.765
You stay away from us, you hear?

48:57.601 --> 48:59.330
Want some of this?

49:17.254 --> 49:19.916
One, two, three...

49:35.472 --> 49:38.168
- Got your hat, honey?
- Yeah.

50:14.745 --> 50:17.714
Caleb, why don't you check out
the dire wolf?

50:17.781 --> 50:20.409
- I'll catch up with you, okay?
- Okay.

50:34.398 --> 50:36.889
Do you know that all
wolves are born deaf?

50:36.967 --> 50:38.594
Really?

50:38.668 --> 50:40.101
But, you know, when they get older,

50:40.170 --> 50:42.730
they can hear another wolf's howl
from 10 miles away.

50:42.806 --> 50:45.001
Wow. How did you know that?

50:45.075 --> 50:47.703
I read it in a <i>National Geographic.</i>

50:47.778 --> 50:50.770
<i>Mammal responses to rising</i>
<i>temperatures and other climate changes...</i>

50:50.847 --> 50:51.939
Hi.

50:52.783 --> 50:53.875
Hi.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.941
Is that your daughter?

50:57.354 --> 51:01.256
- Yeah, why?
- Why? That's my son,

51:01.324 --> 51:04.851
and they look like
they're already best friends.

51:04.928 --> 51:07.897
Yeah, Abby's probably telling him
about the animals.

51:07.964 --> 51:12.162
Even as a baby,
she was completely fascinated with them.

51:12.235 --> 51:16.763
Yeah, he's the same.
He likes extinct animals.

51:18.942 --> 51:20.273
I'm John.

51:21.578 --> 51:23.102
Hi. Diana.

51:24.214 --> 51:25.545
What are they doing now?

51:25.615 --> 51:28.106
Caleb's showing her something
in sign language.

51:28.185 --> 51:31.018
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- He's not.

51:32.489 --> 51:35.583
Sounds just get jumbled up sometimes.

51:36.793 --> 51:40.729
He has a hearing aid, which helps,
but he's not deaf.

51:40.797 --> 51:43.357
He is an expert in sign language.

51:44.868 --> 51:47.666
I don't think it's ever been this hot
in October.

51:47.737 --> 51:49.364
Air conditioner must be out.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.407
Dad, can we get a drink?

51:51.475 --> 51:52.999
Can we get one, too?

51:53.076 --> 51:55.840
Hey, would you and Abby like to join us?

51:57.147 --> 51:59.012
Sure, that'd be nice.

51:59.850 --> 52:01.249
Abby, this is John.

52:01.318 --> 52:02.683
Hi.
- Hey, Abby.

52:03.153 --> 52:04.142
What's that over there?

52:04.221 --> 52:07.213
It can be tough sometimes,
because, you know, I'm by myself.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.087
I know how you feel.

52:09.159 --> 52:12.151
- You're a single parent, too?
- Yeah.

52:13.163 --> 52:14.221
I kicked him out years ago.

52:14.297 --> 52:16.322
He couldn't keep his hands to himself,

52:16.399 --> 52:19.732
so I decided he couldn't keep me
to himself either.

52:19.803 --> 52:23.830
Well, it's... It's his loss.

52:25.976 --> 52:28.501
And you? You're separated, or...

52:29.646 --> 52:31.204
Diana,

52:33.250 --> 52:35.718
we didn't meet here by accident.

52:37.420 --> 52:40.878
I need to talk to you about something,

52:40.957 --> 52:44.552
ask you something about your mother.

52:47.097 --> 52:50.225
My mother? What about my mother?

52:50.300 --> 52:55.397
Did she have some kind of ability?

52:56.873 --> 52:58.807
Ability?

52:58.875 --> 53:01.275
A gift of some kind?

53:03.647 --> 53:06.377
- Who are you?
- Yeah, it's awkward. You don't know me.

53:06.449 --> 53:09.907
I'm John Koestler.
I teach astrophysics at MIT.

53:09.986 --> 53:12.045
My son goes to William Dawes Elementary,

53:12.122 --> 53:15.023
which is the same school
your mother went to.

53:15.091 --> 53:20.757
Fifty years ago, she put this
in a time capsule. It's a list of dates,

53:20.830 --> 53:25.927
events that I think
she believed would happen.

53:26.002 --> 53:27.299
Look, I don't know
what any of this is about...

53:27.370 --> 53:29.668
And I thought if I could talk to you
or your father...

53:29.739 --> 53:31.434
My father's dead.

53:33.743 --> 53:38.112
I think it's possible that there are people,
like your mother, Lucinda,

53:38.181 --> 53:40.376
who can see things before they occur.

53:40.450 --> 53:42.816
Abby, we're leaving!

53:42.886 --> 53:44.183
Honey?

53:45.488 --> 53:47.217
I followed one of your
mother's predictions

53:47.290 --> 53:50.453
and I watched 81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday,

53:50.527 --> 53:53.360
when she said it would happen,
where she said it would happen,

53:53.430 --> 53:55.295
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

53:55.365 --> 53:58.266
She says 170 people will die tomorrow
in New York City,

53:58.335 --> 54:01.133
and in three days' time,
October 19th, 33 more.

54:01.204 --> 54:03.729
Stay away from me and my daughter.

54:04.975 --> 54:08.467
Abby? Let's go, honey. Come on.

54:15.151 --> 54:17.278
Stay right there. Diana?

54:17.887 --> 54:19.582
Diana, I think this has something
to do with my son.

54:19.656 --> 54:20.782
Get in there, honey.

54:20.857 --> 54:23.382
I don't know how, or why,
but I think he's in danger.

54:23.460 --> 54:26.554
So I'm asking you please, please help us.

54:28.431 --> 54:29.830
I can't.

54:47.484 --> 54:50.317
<i>A class-action suit</i>
<i>brought by the families of the victims</i>

54:50.387 --> 54:53.254
<i>is meant to be heard
beginning next month.</i>

54:53.323 --> 54:57.384
<i>Commuters along the Eastern Seaboard</i>
<i>are reassessing their travel plans</i>

54:57.460 --> 55:01.624
<i>in response to an FBI warning</i>
<i>of a possible terrorist plot.</i>

55:01.698 --> 55:04.861
<i>The Department of Homeland Security</i>
<i>raised the national threat level</i>

55:04.934 --> 55:08.529
<i>from elevated to high</i>
<i>after intelligence reports suggested</i>

55:08.605 --> 55:12.473
<i>an attack on a major East Coast city</i>
<i>may be imminent.</i>

55:12.542 --> 55:15.010
<i>Police have urged citizens to stay vigilant.</i>

55:52.916 --> 55:54.474
<i>FBI New York,</i>
<i>how may I direct your call?</i>

55:54.551 --> 55:58.214
The attack will take place tomorrow at
the corner of Lafayette and Worth Streets.

55:58.288 --> 56:01.052
Cordon off the area from midnight.
Are you clear on that?

56:01.124 --> 56:02.557
<i>Sir, let me patch you through</i>
<i>to our agents...</i>

56:02.625 --> 56:06.425
Please! Do exactly as I say
or many people will die.

56:06.496 --> 56:08.623
This is not a crank call.

56:12.836 --> 56:16.067
You said you'd take him off my hands.

56:41.831 --> 56:44.959
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

56:46.002 --> 56:48.266
Don't let him watch the news.

57:14.531 --> 57:17.625
<i>Well, traffic on the FDR</i>
<i>right now is looking pretty heavy,</i>

57:17.700 --> 57:19.998
<i>this gridlock we're looking at</i>
<i>probably won't let up for hours.</i>

57:20.069 --> 57:23.368
<i>Most of this traffic is headed</i>
<i>downtown to the Westside...</i>

58:11.754 --> 58:13.619
Why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off?

58:13.690 --> 58:14.748
Excuse me?

58:14.824 --> 58:16.985
I said why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off?

58:17.060 --> 58:20.291
- Didn't you get the tip-off about the attack?
- Sir. Sir, please calm down.

58:20.363 --> 58:24.197
If you'll accompany me,
we'll get this matter taken care of.

58:24.267 --> 58:25.564
Sir, stop!

58:25.635 --> 58:27.535
Hey, man.
- Stop!

58:30.807 --> 58:33.367
I got him. Let's go! Move! Move!

59:54.857 --> 59:57.223
Suspect sighted. Platform three.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:04.930
Hey!

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.527
Out of the way! Let me through!

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.095
Forward car.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.651
- Get off the train.
- Why? What's wrong?

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:23.913
Just take the baby and get off the train.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.750
What's your problem, pal?

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.052
Hold it right there, sir.

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:32.188
Transit police. I'm asking you to stop!

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.855
That's him! You have to stop him!

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.761
Transit police. Turn around.

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.599
Now!

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:47.500
Put your hands up!

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.808
Please! Please, I won't do it again,
I promise! I'll give them back!

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.713
I'll give them back! I'll give them back.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.516
<i>Next stop, Spring.</i>

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:25.373
Move back! Move back!

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.750
Get out of the way!

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.223
Move outside.

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:31.729
<i>make their way through</i>
<i>the massive tangle of wreckage...</i>

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.936
<i>... New York City subway disaster since...</i>

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.808
<i>It could be the result of a terrorist plot...</i>

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.813
<i>Federal Aviation Administration officials</i>

01:03:57.533 --> 01:04:02.232
Grace. I got held up by work.
I'll be over in 30 minutes.

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.408
No, I'm fine. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:11.705
Three, four, five...
- Five, six...

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.267
Caleb, go inside.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.772
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:46.178
- Want to check out the house?
- Sure.

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.579
You said October 19th?

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.961
My mother used to talk about that day
all the time.

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.158
She said it was the day I was going to die.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:25.187
All my life I've had this thing
hanging over my head

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.744
and Abby's.

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:32.092
I just don't believe
anyone can predict my future.

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:37.522
And what does it matter, anyway?

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.569
We all die in the end.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.765
I don't want to know what my future holds.

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:58.045
Last year, my wife was on
a business trip to Phoenix

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:01.456
a few days before my birthday

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:08.326
and a fire started in her hotel
at 4:00 in the morning.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:13.867
The investigators said
that Allison died of smoke inhalation.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.461
Died in her sleep.

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:19.702
She wouldn't have known
anything about it.

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:27.242
While she was dying,
I was at home, in the front yard.

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.753
I always thought
you were supposed to sense

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.654
when the people you love are in danger,

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.354
but I didn't feel anything.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.030
Nothing.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.769
I was just blowing leaves off the lawn.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.574
I'm so sorry, John.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:57.942
Well, but my point is that from then on,

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:03.145
I decided that no one can know
what was coming,

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:10.249
and life was just a string
of random accidents and mistakes.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:16.121
And then I got that list.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:24.904
If that had come to me before Allison left,
I would have saved her life.

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.572
I need to know.

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.534
It's still here.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:28.960
What's this?

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.237
Have you seen this?

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:37.803
Abby used to do this sometimes,
write things backwards,

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.908
and that last number, I don't think it's 33.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.218
It's EE.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:50.955
EE? Initials. Someone she knew?

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.962
I don't know.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.319
I was nine when she overdosed.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.048
The only time I ever came out here
was with my father

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:29.029
when he identified her body.

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:31.566
She willed the property to me,

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:36.995
but I never came back for any of her things.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:58.216
When I was little, my mother used
to tell me that she could hear voices

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.389
whispering to her,

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.791
telling her horrible things.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:12.669
And then one day,
my dad came and took me away from her.

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:16.036
He said she was sick.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.917
She said she moved out here to get ready.

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.783
I never knew what she meant by that.

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:36.691
I made this for her one Christmas.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.201
I never knew she kept it.

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:37.249
She used to stare at this picture for hours.

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:55.370
That's where they found her.

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:59.145
In there.

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.903
Have you seen enough?

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.483
Yeah. Okay. We'll go.

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.162
Abby?

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.165
Abby?

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:21.589
<i>Abby.</i>

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.071
<i>Caleb.</i>

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.838
<i>Come.</i>

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.742
<i>Come with us.</i>

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:58.457
EE isn't just one person.

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.249
Abby, no!

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:28.126
Abby!

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:32.360
What? What? What? It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.095
They were here.

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:36.967
Who? Who was here, Caleb?

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:41.635
- Did they hurt you?
- No. They were talking to us.

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:47.012
- What did they say?
- I don't know. They were all talking at once.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:51.018
They said we could go with them,
if we chose to.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:57.748
- Who did, baby? Who?
- The whisper people.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.678
Hey, lock the doors.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:42.266
What do you want with my son?

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.376
Answer me!

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:22.442
I just know they've been following us
for days.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:25.742
I think someone's been following me
and Abby, too.

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:39.250
That's why she didn't write
any coordinates down after the final date.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:42.559
There isn't a single location this time.

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:47.728
Are you telling me that my mother
could see the end of everything?

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.864
That we're all going to die tomorrow?

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:58.573
She was disturbed, John.
She could've just made it all up.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.213
She's been right so far, Diana.

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.248
About everything.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:12.458
Abby's... Abby's all I've got, John.

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:15.121
I can't let anything happen to her.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:16.615
Caleb, you really need to sleep.

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:24.659
I can hear them whispering to me
sometimes like Abby can.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:28.299
Could Lucinda hear them, too?

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.671
Yeah, I think she did. Yes.

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:41.808
Are me and Abby gonna die?

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:50.890
No. I will never let that happen, Caleb.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.360
Do you hear me? Never.

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:00.529
You...

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:21.684
Abby, what do you like to eat for breakfast?

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.353
Abby?

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.422
What are you doing, honey?

01:19:30.799 --> 01:19:32.323
It's the sun.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:41.674
There's something I need to check.
Get Abby, you're coming with us.

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:42.903
Caleb!

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:02.789
Okay. All right.

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:04.991
Hey, John, what happened?

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.164
Hey!

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:12.999
Talk to me. What happened?

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:17.408
I've been calling you off the hook
ever since I heard about the subway.

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.574
John?

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:26.086
Do you remember that paper
on extra-solar activity I published?

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.519
Yeah, sure, I remember.

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:31.787
I found evidence of a series of super-flares
from a star in the outer-Pleiades region.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.055
Right. Ratings were off the chart.

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:38.956
We were both wrong.
The numbers are a warning,

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.867
but not just to me or any random group.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:46.136
They're a warning to everyone.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:51.641
Okay. You're officially scaring
the shit out of me right now.

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:58.015
The super-flare, in our own solar system.

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:01.251
A 100 microtesla wave of radiation

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:06.522
that would destroy our ozone layer,
killing every living organism on the planet.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.669
We have to let everyone know.
We have to call the NOAA.

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:19.400
They already know.
The announcement will come anytime now.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:38.552
I thought there was some purpose
to all of this.

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:42.893
Why did I get this prediction
if there's nothing I can do about it?

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:47.864
How am I supposed
to stop the end of the world?

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:59.413
Go home, Phil. Be with Kim tonight.

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:16.955
Diana.

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.400
I'm so stupid.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:25.766
I've spent my whole life
knowing she was right

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:29.939
and pretending that she was insane.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:37.073
If we hide underground,
we've got a chance, don't we?

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.178
It's possible.

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:46.754
I know some caves
off Route 40 past Groton.

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:51.527
Hardly anyone knows about them,
but I used to play there as a child.

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.931
We could try there, right?

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.864
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:02.300
Caleb, put some clothes and shoes
into your backpack.

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:06.108
Diana, load all the non-perishable food,
any water you can, into the truck.

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.808
Let's try to be out of here in 10 minutes.

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:10.476
You start. I'll get some bags.
- Yeah.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:20.684
<i>Allison wanted me to call you</i>

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.782
the day she left for Phoenix.

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:28.022
She wanted me to promise her
that I'd call you.

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:31.027
<i>I know, Jonathan.</i>

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:38.534
We haven't spoken in so long,
I don't really even know why anymore.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:45.578
I need to tell you something.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:47.879
<i>Yes?</i>

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:54.013
That sermon you preached every year
at Pentecost, about the gifts of the Spirit,

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:57.289
one was the gift of prophecy.

01:24:57.358 --> 01:25:03.228
<i>1 Corinthians 12. Yes, I remember it.</i>
<i>The church should respect the prophet.</i>

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.463
I have a prophecy.

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:10.871
It's about to be proven accurate.

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:17.408
I need you to respect it
and receive it as the truth.

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:21.482
This heat we're experiencing
isn't going to get better.

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:26.142
<i>It's going to get worse, much worse.</i>

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:31.185
I need you to get Mom and Grace
and any supplies you can,

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:35.753
and get below ground tonight.
The basement, the sewer, the T.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.322
Just get as deep as you can
and as fast as you can.

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:44.096
And that will keep us safe from this heat?

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:51.341
I don't know that, but we have to try, right?

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:56.815
<i>I'm sorry, John, but I'm afraid I'm not</i>
<i>going anywhere tonight or any night.</i>

01:25:56.885 --> 01:26:01.447
I appreciate your concern,
but if it's my time, it's my time.

01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:06.352
I'm ready whenever the good Lord calls me.

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:08.088
<i>Are you?</i>

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.653
- Dad?
<i>- Hello?</i>

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.590
- John?
- Dad?

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.345
Caleb, let's go!

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.713
Caleb.

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:37.853
Caleb.

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.029
Caleb!

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.665
Caleb, stop!

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:56.036
- Caleb!
- Huh? Huh?

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.910
What were you doing?

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.542
Did I do that?

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:13.650
This isn't the way to the highway.

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:21.332
Everybody wait here.

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:24.866
John!

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.540
John!

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:07.871
John, please, why are we back here?

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:16.584
John, please, what are you doing?
We have to get to the caves.

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:20.116
- We're not going to the caves.
- What?

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:21.855
She knew the coordinates
for this last event.

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.328
She tried to write them down.

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:27.562
The teacher said she was interrupted,
ran out of time,

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:30.934
so she scratched them into this door.

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:33.030
She tried to tell us where to go.

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:36.543
You're not making any sense.
Look at you. Look at what you're doing!

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:38.704
The numbers are the key to everything.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.647
Please! Please, John, we need to leave!

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:53.116
We're taking my car. Come on.
Let's go. Keep your bags with you.

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:58.624
Be here, please, be here.

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:01.432
Throw it in the back.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.164
What about Dad?

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:11.200
He's just gotta finish what he's doing.
He's gonna follow us.

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:13.247
We're just getting a head start, okay?

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.570
Diana?

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:47.876
Caleb!

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:50.748
Caleb!

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.385
Caleb!

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:57.455
Caleb!

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:25.942
Where are we going, Mom?
Are we hiding from the whisper people?

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:30.821
Yes, baby.
They won't find us where we're going.

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:33.554
Mom, they know where we are.

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:38.122
- How do you know that?
- They told us so.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.660
- You've seen them again?
- No. They just talk to us.

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:49.638
How, Abby? How do they talk to you?

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:52.679
They whisper into our heads.

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:55.109
Oh, God.

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:04.989
Oh, God.

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:07.186
- I want to call my dad.
- The phones are down!

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:10.992
I promise he's right behind us!
We'll call him when we get there!

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.603
Wait right here!

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:25.771
<i>Now let's get back to the</i>
<i>financial markets, if we may, for a moment.</i>

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:29.078
<i>Let's check it out on the grid here this</i>
<i>morning. We've got Treasuries moving up...</i>

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.641
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, man.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.409
Number five.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.649
<i>... India is a better bet than the US</i>
<i>or Europe,</i>

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:38.317
<i>and that the dollar will continue</i>
<i>its long slide...</i>

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:39.416
20.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.054
<i>This is an Emergency</i>
<i>Broadcast Transmission.</i>

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:49.730
<i>This is not a test. This is</i>
<i>an Emergency Broadcast Transmission.</i>

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:54.168
<i>Today, NO AA has concluded...</i>
- Turn that up!

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.607
<i>... the solar flares may last longer</i>

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:59.134
<i>and cause more damage to our</i>
<i>infrastructure than we originally thought.</i>

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:02.114
<i>We're recommending that people</i>
<i>stay indoors until further notice.</i>

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:05.516
<i>Bring your pets inside.</i>
<i>Stock up on extra water and, if possible,</i>

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:08.350
<i>seek out fortified underground shelter.</i>

01:32:08.422 --> 01:32:12.483
<i>- General, what time is it happening?</i>
<i>- General, excuse me...</i>

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:21.800
<i>The shelters we have</i>
<i>are currently overwhelmed.</i>

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:24.667
<i>The best advice we can offer the public</i>
<i>is to seek your own.</i>

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:25.763
<i>Sir!</i>

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.239
<i>One more question about the warning.</i>

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:29.435
<i>We are assessing this information</i>
<i>as it becomes available.</i>

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:30.602
<i>It was only recently confirmed.</i>

01:32:30.678 --> 01:32:31.872
<i>Where is the President?</i>

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:33.140
<i>The President and his staff</i>

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:36.615
<i>are currently being transported</i>
<i>to a secure location.</i>

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:37.708
<i>Hello?</i>
- Dad?

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:41.312
Caleb, are you okay?
Tell me exactly where you are.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.914
We're at a gas station. I don't know where.

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:52.030
<i>The damage information regarding</i>
<i>the destructive power of these flares</i>

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:53.930
<i>is a scientific matter,</i>
<i>and I'm not gonna speculate...</i>

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.559
Are you coming with us?

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:58.002
<i>I need you to stay right there.</i>
<i>Get me an...</i>

01:32:58.072 --> 01:33:00.336
Caleb, get back to the car now.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.602
<i>Caleb?</i>
- John?

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.541
- Where are you?
<i>- We're in Westford.</i>

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:06.978
I'm sorry.
I had to do this for Abby and for Caleb.

01:33:07.048 --> 01:33:09.846
- I'm taking them to the caves.
- I found the numbers!

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.942
They're the location
of your mother's mobile home.

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.486
That's where we've got to go.

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:17.081
- Don't do this to me. Please.
- I know how it sounds.

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:19.718
You want us to head toward the place
where this is supposed to happen?

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:20.818
<i>Are you insane?</i>

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.557
It's a chance we gotta take
or we're all gonna die!

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.360
Stay where you are! I'll be right there!

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.731
No! If we go to the caves,
we have a chance!

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.770
You said the sun can't reach that far!

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:33.466
The caves won't save us! Nothing can!

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:37.738
The radiation will penetrate a mile
into the Earth's crust! Do you hear me?

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:40.144
<i>Our only shot is to go</i>
<i>where the numbers want us to go.</i>

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:43.012
<i>- It's what we're meant to do!</i>
- No, I don't believe you!

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:45.348
I'm taking the children!
We have to save the children!

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:50.379
<i>Don't you move, Diana! Caleb is my son,</i>
<i>and I'll decide where he goes!</i>

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:54.989
<i>Diana! Caleb! Are you there?</i>

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:04.200
Abby!

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.565
Abby! Abby!

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:12.403
Help! Somebody took my daughter!

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.282
Abby!

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.501
Damn it!

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.570
Where did she go?

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:59.118
<i>Everyone needs to do this immediately.</i>

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:02.087
<i>We are facing a natural threat</i>
<i>of global proportions,</i>

01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:03.919
<i>and there is very little</i>
<i>that this government...</i>

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:05.959
Same thing happened with Y2K.

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:09.655
They are gonna wake up tomorrow morning
feeling pretty stupid.

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:12.130
Thirty minutes ago there was
a woman here. She was screaming!

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:15.635
She was with a kid! He was on your
pay phone! He's a nine-year-old kid!

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:19.264
Some guy took the lady's car
with the kids inside. Drove right off with it.

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.968
- The woman, where'd she go?
- That way!

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:25.505
Go lock the door! Stop that, you crazy...

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:28.912
You've got to pay for that! Hey, stop!

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:30.917
<i>You need to</i>
<i>seek protection from the sun</i>

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.646
<i>and it needs to be immediately.</i>

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.120
<i>We're facing a deadly threat.</i>

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:48.795
Get out!
- I didn't see you!

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:00.810
Hey! Get out of here!

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:11.114
- Is she... Where are the children?
- We can't help you now, sir.

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:23.395
Calm down, all of you!
Just calm down!

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:26.534
Charge.

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.273
Clear.

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:34.942
Again.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.312
Clear.

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.984
- Okay, call it.
- 12:00 midnight exactly.

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:49.586
There's a man down. We need help.

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:16.953
Diana.

01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:22.985
I'm sorry.

01:40:30.657 --> 01:40:31.988
Caleb!

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.104
Where is he?

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.042
Where's Caleb?

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.310
I want my son!

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:04.088
I want my son!

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:06.857
Now!

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:08.121
Dad, don't!

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.729
Are you hurt? What did he do to you?

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:23.436
It's okay, Dad. I'm okay. This is my friend.

01:41:24.878 --> 01:41:27.005
They said I can keep him.

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:35.989
Caleb, I want you to come with me.
We're going now.

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:38.251
But we have to go with them.

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:41.690
They won't hurt us.

01:41:43.097 --> 01:41:45.759
Abby, are you okay?

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:49.229
- Your mom wanted to be here, honey.
- I know.

01:41:49.303 --> 01:41:52.534
The whisper people told me
that Mommy's safe now.

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:55.541
They've been protecting us all along, Dad.

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:59.409
They sent a message ahead of them
to prepare the way,

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.710
and now they've come for us.

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:06.109
Who are you?

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:05.772
It's time to go, Dad.
They've chosen us so we can start over.

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:08.246
So everything can start over.

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:49.513
What do you mean? I don't understand.

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.958
Why is he saying that, Dad?

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.261
What?

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.861
What's he saying, Caleb?

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:05.564
He's saying only the chosen must go,

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:09.868
those who heard the call.

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.114
Please.

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:57.086
I can't go with you, Caleb.
I mean, I can't go with you.

01:44:58.225 --> 01:45:00.591
They've chosen us to go.

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.761
They haven't chosen us, Caleb.

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:09.135
They've chosen you, both of you.

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:17.974
You have to take care of Abby now.
You have to be strong for her.

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:26.082
No. I don't want to go without you.

01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:31.952
They could've taken you away from me,
but they didn't,

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:36.122
because you have to make
this decision yourself.

01:45:36.196 --> 01:45:38.596
But you promised.

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:42.032
You said we'd be together forever.

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:46.596
We will be. We will be. I'm not leaving you.

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:50.404
But you gotta go with them.
You gotta go. You gotta go with them.

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:55.244
Caleb, Caleb, listen to me, Caleb.
Stop, stop. Stop. Listen to me. Listen.

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:58.944
We're gonna be together.
We're all gonna be together.

01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:00.987
And Mom's gonna be with us, too.

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:04.888
I know it. I know that now. I know it.

01:46:06.993 --> 01:46:10.451
Look. Here. Take this.

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:13.658
Take this. Keep it with you.

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:17.663
One day, you'll know what it means.

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:26.941
I love you, Daddy.

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:45.148
Where's Caleb?

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:47.984
Caleb's safe.

01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:52.462
<i>We're going to stay on the air</i>
<i>for as long as possible.</i>

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:56.899
<i>All we can say is what</i>
<i>we've been repeating all morning.</i>

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:59.768
<i>Get to any kind of underground shelter.</i>

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:04.141
<i>We've been told the satellite...</i>

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:24.154
This isn't the end, Son.

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:25.562
I know.
