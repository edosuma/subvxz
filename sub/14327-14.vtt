THIS STINKS!

18:59.680 --> 19:01.181
THERE'S NO WAY OUT!

19:01.265 --> 19:05.811
SECTION 7,
SUBPARAGRAPH A-19,

19:05.894 --> 19:07.145
BREACH OF CONTRACT.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.145
{\an1}WHAT?

19:07.229 --> 19:10.232
{\an1}IF TIMMY MAKES
AN IRRESPONSIBLE WISH

19:10.315 --> 19:12.526
THAT IS AT THE SAME TIME
RESPONSIBLE,

19:12.609 --> 19:13.318
THEY CAN'T SHOCK US,

19:13.402 --> 19:16.780
AND THE CONTRACT
IS NULL AND VOID.

19:16.864 --> 19:17.406
BLUE IS A COLOR!

19:19.283 --> 19:23.662
A RESPONSIBLE
IRRESPONSIBLE WISH, EH?

19:26.582 --> 19:29.376
H.P., DO I HAVE
A WISH FOR YOU.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.128
IS IT THE WISH
WHERE YOU WISH

19:31.211 --> 19:33.088
FOR FAIRYWORLD TO BE
RULED BY PIXIES?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.258
{\an5}IF IT'S NOT,
YOU'VE BROKEN
THE CONTRACT,

19:36.341 --> 19:39.052
{\an5}AND YOU GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO COSMO AND WANDA.

19:39.136 --> 19:43.265
GO ME. GO ME.
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

19:43.348 --> 19:47.603
{\an4}OH. DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT A WISH,
ALL RIGHT.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.856
{\an1}I WISH COSMO AND WANDA
WERE MADE OF RUBBER!

19:56.403 --> 19:57.029
{\an7}¦¦

19:56.403 --> 19:57.029
BAD WISH, TURNER.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.865
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR FAIRIES.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.367
[BUZZ BUZZ]

20:05.162 --> 20:06.288
GASP.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.123
GUESS AGAIN, PINHEAD.

20:08.206 --> 20:09.124
THEY'RE RUBBER,

20:09.207 --> 20:12.628
{\an1}AND RUBBER DOESN'T
CONDUCT ELECTRICITY!

20:12.711 --> 20:15.213
{\an1}AND SINCE I DIDN'T
MAKE THE APPROVED WISH,

20:15.297 --> 20:17.424
{\an1}YOU HAVE TO LET ME OUT
OF THE CONTRACT.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.801
BECAUSE HE MADE
A RESPONSIBLE WISH.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.138
{\an1}WHICH IS ALSO
IRRESPONSIBLE. WATCH!

20:23.221 --> 20:25.265
WHEE!

20:26.391 --> 20:29.311
{\an5}DRAT. IT SEEMS
AS THOUGH I HAVE
BEEN TRAPPED

20:29.394 --> 20:30.979
WITHIN MY OWN
LOOPHOLE.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.065
WE'LL SEE WHAT
MY ASSOCIATE JORGEN

20:33.148 --> 20:34.650
HAS TO SAY
ABOUT THIS.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.819
LOOPHOLE OR NOT,

20:37.903 --> 20:41.698
{\an5}I AM NOW GOING TO
TURN YOUR FAIRIES
INTO PIXIES,

20:41.782 --> 20:45.577
BORING, DULL, UNFUN

20:45.661 --> 20:50.499
PIX--UNH--PIX--
UNH--PIX--UGH!

20:50.582 --> 20:51.625
THAT'S FUNNY.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.669
I DON'T REMEMBER
JORGEN BEING MADE OF METAL

20:53.752 --> 20:55.087
{\an1}OR HAVING AN EXTENSION CORD
STICKING OUT OF HIS BUTT.

20:55.170 --> 20:59.007
JORGEN IS NOT MADE OF METAL,

20:59.091 --> 21:00.717
BUT HE MAY HAVE
AN EXTENSION CORD

21:00.801 --> 21:02.260
STICKING OUT
OF HIS BUTT!

21:02.344 --> 21:04.346
I DON'T USUALLY
LOOK BACK THERE!

21:07.933 --> 21:09.351
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.437
{\an4}I WISH THE REAL
JORGEN VON STRANGLE
WAS HERE.

21:20.237 --> 21:24.032
{\an5}UH, TIMMY TURNER,
YOU'VE INTERRUPTED
MY COOKING CLASS.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.867
{\an8}IF MY SOUFFLE FALLS,

21:25.951 --> 21:26.660
{\an8}I WILL BAKE YOU
A MIGHTY CAKE

21:26.743 --> 21:28.578
OF DEATH!

21:28.662 --> 21:33.375
HEY!

21:33.458 --> 21:36.878
{\an5}PAY NO ATTENTION
TO THE PIXIE CONTROLLING
THE JORGEN ROBOT.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.007
{\an1}EVERYONE, YOU REMEMBER
MY EVIL HENCHMAN SANDERSON.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.801
SANDERSON, EVERYONE.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.469
HELLO, EVERYONE.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.723
{\an1}SO YOU'RE NOT
HELPING THE PIXIES?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.307
HUH? PIXIES?

21:49.391 --> 21:52.978
{\an5}WHY WOULD I HELP
THESE DULL,
POINTY-HEADED WIMPS?

21:56.982 --> 21:59.526
OW! I MEAN, YAY!
WE'RE NOT RUBBER!

21:59.609 --> 22:00.861
FAIRIES ARE HERE
TO GRANT FUN WISHES

22:00.944 --> 22:02.946
OF PAIN!

22:03.030 --> 22:05.449
OH. WAIT.
THAT IS ME.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.618
{\an4}OF COURSE,
THEY DID BREAK ME
OF MY BAD WISH HABIT.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.330
{\an7}¦¦¦¦

22:09.995 --> 22:12.330
OH. ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T HAVE

22:12.414 --> 22:14.332
ONE MORE BAD WISH
IN YOU?

22:14.416 --> 22:16.501
{\an1}MAYBE.

22:21.256 --> 22:25.427
{\an1}FINALLY, SOMETHING
MORE BORING THAN WE ARE.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.890
OH, THE SINGLE-CELLED
IRONY.

22:29.973 --> 22:33.518
AAH.

22:29.973 --> 22:33.518
AAH.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.441
{\an8}¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦

22:38.565 --> 22:39.441
NOPE. NO CORD.
