WEBVTT

00:07.382 --> 00:11.177
Don't play chicken with a country
that's ready to lob a tactical nuke.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.346
Try everything before that.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.431
She's got a good idea.

00:14.431 --> 00:19.811
It hasn't escaped me that you are
an incredibly attractive, compassionate...

00:21.438 --> 00:22.272
man.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.650
But, at the moment,
we have bigger fish to fry.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.278
I gave you 15 years. Give me a chance.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.447
So you're back-seat driving
the vice president?

00:30.447 --> 00:32.323
So I'm married to you.

00:32.323 --> 00:36.286
We hit Russia, Russia hits back.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.122
But the Lenkov Group isn't Russia, right?

00:39.122 --> 00:42.959
Right now is the one time
you get to break shit.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.919
What is it that you think I should break?

00:44.919 --> 00:47.046
The secretary of state.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.883
You may not see that right now,
but we're great together.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.595
I feel it too. I can't think when you're
in the same room. I can barely breathe.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.181
U.S. and the UK go to war with Russia?

00:56.181 --> 00:58.725
That's the kind of thing
where people have babies.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.353
- Are you asking me to have--?
- No. That's the whole point.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.814
But, a dog?

01:04.814 --> 01:09.235
Do you want to be
in a public relationship with me?

01:09.235 --> 01:10.403
Yes.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.988
It's better than one, isn't it?

01:11.988 --> 01:12.947
What?

01:14.365 --> 01:15.200
Two.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.214
<i>I should go.</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:30.298
<i>Where?</i>

01:30.298 --> 01:33.551
<i>Back to my room,
before the staff find me.</i>

01:33.551 --> 01:35.887
You can relax for five minutes.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.807
Are you asking me to stay?

01:39.349 --> 01:41.976
I'm saying you can relax.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.606
Are you asking me to stay?

01:46.606 --> 01:49.692
Are you asking me to ask you to stay?

01:49.692 --> 01:50.944
Should I?

01:53.988 --> 01:55.073
I don't know.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.325
Maybe.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.995
I shouldn't do that to you.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.831
You should do whatever you want to me.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.250
I shouldn't.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.794
I'm sorry.

02:07.794 --> 02:08.753
Why?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.713
I didn't think you could do it.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.340
Because I'm an asshole.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.511
You are an asshole
but you had reason to worry.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.596
You were great.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.182
I always am.
Sometimes you don't know 'til later.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.562
You should not forgive me.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.105
Maybe I won't.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.941
- Nah, I will.
- Don't do that.

02:29.941 --> 02:34.070
Don't make me be the only one
who thinks through the obstacles.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.238
I can handle it.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.740
I can't.
I don't like being that angry at you.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.163
So, what worked?

02:44.038 --> 02:46.082
Last few days, it worked, right?

02:46.082 --> 02:48.168
- It did.
- Yeah, so why?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.752
I don't know.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.546
No, you gotta make it clear.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.631
Obviously, I don't always know.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.718
What worked?

02:58.219 --> 02:59.888
I mean, you set the agenda.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.472
You came up with a moonshot.

03:01.472 --> 03:05.393
I made a few phone calls
to make you feel you weren't in it alone.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.603
That's not what you did.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.520
- No?
- No.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.064
- So, what did I do?
- You made a hundred phone calls.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.693
You made people
feel brilliant and important.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.572
- They run after you, desperate to help.
- They are brilliant and important.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.616
The guy from Phoenix?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284
He's just important.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.542
You didn't hate it?

03:31.294 --> 03:32.128
What?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.547
Being a backup singer.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.840
No, I didn't.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.844
I thought I would.

03:39.844 --> 03:40.762
But, uh...

03:41.304 --> 03:42.138
no.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.765
It was kind of fun.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.312
I don't want to do nothing.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.730
Well, of course not.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.565
I'm not ready to retire.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.943
I would never think that.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.448
You know, I didn't spend
the last decade working on my tan.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.866
Yeah, I know that.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.244
It can be a big job,
being a backup singer.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.579
That's not quite what you did.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.622
Humming.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.165
You made it all happen.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.126
Whatever fuck-witted scheme
I came up with.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.297
I don't think you should start
with making it all happen.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.799
- Sure.
- That could get tricky.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.967
Jesus, Kate,

04:18.967 --> 04:23.012
I attended a two-day emergency meeting
of world leaders

04:23.012 --> 04:25.682
and I did not speak unless spoken to.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.642
You were so great.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.520
I spent a shocking amount of time
discussing the rain.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.689
You were so great.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.068
Don't go.

04:37.986 --> 04:38.945
Not yet.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.490
Do you want me to stay?

04:45.576 --> 04:46.744
I don't know.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.622
But I don't want you to go.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.379
Don't freak out.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.797
Love it already.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.966
I wanna hit pause on...

05:01.217 --> 05:03.803
declaring our relationship status.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.973
- Just 'til the Russia thing plays out.
- Okay.

05:08.099 --> 05:08.933
Is it?

05:08.933 --> 05:09.851
Yeah.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.769
What?

05:11.769 --> 05:13.396
I'm cool, it's just...

05:14.397 --> 05:15.273
What?

05:15.273 --> 05:18.276
People have waited a long time
for the Russia thing to play out.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.235
I'm talking a week.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.739
Napoleon told Joséphine he wanted
to wait 'til the Russia thing played out.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.824
I knew this was gonna be a problem.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.535
I don't love lying to my boss.

05:27.535 --> 05:32.123
She's been your boss for ten minutes.
You can not love it a little longer.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.543
I'm in that zone where it would've been
weird to say something right off.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.587
Now it's weird I haven't mentioned it yet.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.340
- I don't mention things for a living.
- Yeah, it's fucking weird.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.300
I don't live under the misconception

05:42.300 --> 05:45.595
that anybody knows the whole story
of anything, ever.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.348
So I'm not compelled
to share everything I think I know.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.600
I can leave stuff out.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.851
Everybody does it.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.436
I'm just cognizant of it.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.188
This is some high-end rationalizing.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.066
Nobody needs the distraction
is the bottom line.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.317
That's fine.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.157
She's meeting Oleg Balakin today, right?

06:06.949 --> 06:08.409
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.084
We're messaging Russia
through every plausible official channel

06:16.084 --> 06:18.586
because every non-official channel's
gone cold.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.797
Langley's been calling
old deconfliction lines

06:20.797 --> 06:22.840
and the phones just keep ringing.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.260
Are you throwing me a bone?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.472
It's a fact.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.142
Relevant to both
of our professional portfolios.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.645
This is worse than a mercy-fuck.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.649
This is a mercy declassification
of eyes-only intelligence.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.819
I'm never telling you anything again.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.862
So all our backchannels are dead?

06:44.862 --> 06:45.988
I don't know.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.241
- Wait for the briefing.
- Come on.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.202
I was all set to parade around
with my girl on my arm.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.496
This just keeps getting better.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.956
Go to dinner with me tonight?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.040
Maybe.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.459
Will you look at me over candlelight?

06:58.459 --> 07:01.671
Talk about Russian non-government
paramilitary organizations?

07:01.671 --> 07:03.631
You know I will.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.933
You'll meet Russian Ambassador
Oleg Balakin at the Foreign Office.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.936
Inform him Britain knows
that the Lenkov Company,

07:16.936 --> 07:21.065
commissioned by the Russian government,
carried out the attack on HMS <i>Courageous.</i>

07:21.065 --> 07:25.570
And that Britain intends to take action
against Lenkov troops in Libya,

07:25.570 --> 07:27.905
with our blessing, in the next 24 hours.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.825
And that will be the period
at the end of the sentence.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.161
Not the next
in a series of escalating moves.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.162
Morning.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.538
And to you, sir.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.626
All good?

07:40.626 --> 07:41.669
It is.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.212
Hmm.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.298
You can keep going.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.009
- Keep going.
- I'll wait.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.136
He can sit in on the briefing.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.473
All right, then. Um...

07:53.473 --> 07:55.975
You'll have talking points from State.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.687
The same conversation
is happening mil-to-mil, intel-to-intel,

07:59.687 --> 08:00.980
every U.S. ambassador

08:00.980 --> 08:03.107
to every Russian ambassador
in every country.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.610
Why are you doing
a démarche at the Foreign Office?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.861
Yeah, it's kind of weird.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.988
United front. Us and the UK.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.782
Why do you put eggs on top of the berries?
Now there's eggs on them.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.242
I'll separate it for you.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.869
- Is that better?
Thank you.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.038
- United front?
- Yes.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.832
Making it clear
there's no daylight between us.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.627
He'll be meeting with Dennison
before he meets with you.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.921
- What's his name? Belkin?
Balakin.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.339
Oleg Balakin.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.882
Russian ambassador to...

08:28.841 --> 08:29.926
this place.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.053
- You know him?
- No.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.680
You wanna call Sergei,
find out if there's an angle?

08:34.680 --> 08:37.058
- Sure.
- Okay. What kind of angle?

08:37.058 --> 08:40.978
Whatever, you know?
He likes toast. He doesn't like toast.

08:40.978 --> 08:43.773
He's a representative of
the Russian Federation. He likes alcohol.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.358
Didn't see it coming.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.235
Be nice.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.569
He's nervous.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.071
Me? No.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.366
- I'll stick to the talking points.
- Thank you.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.493
Period at the end of the sentence.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.911
That's great.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.707
He's trying to figure out
how long he should wait

09:01.707 --> 09:04.585
before he asks if this is a sign
you're serious about VP.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.088
- What, you and me getting along?
- Yeah.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.006
Tell him to be cool
and try not to ruin it.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.385
Okay.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.609
We do. Obviously, they--

09:28.609 --> 09:29.569
Hi there.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.029
- Good morning.
- Oh. Morning, sir.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.531
Are you here to see me?

09:33.531 --> 09:34.865
No, sadly.

09:34.865 --> 09:35.992
Balakin.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.077
Oh. I just saw him myself. Good luck.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.620
- It requires luck?
It might.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.039
- Shit.
- Well, you'll be fine.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.250
- He's mean, but...
- I'm meaner?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.668
I didn't say that.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.420
I didn't.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.713
You thought it.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.090
The policing of thought
has gone out of fashion.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.301
It never goes out of fashion.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.433
Amba-- Ambassador Balakin's
already in there.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.350
Shall we?

10:01.350 --> 10:03.269
I'm not going in. You can do the windup.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.186
Myself?

10:04.186 --> 10:06.606
Then you step out
and it's just the two of them.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.316
Or you could do it.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.109
I can't welcome them.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.360
It's your building.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.029
Yeah.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.330
On behalf of His Majesty's government,

10:22.330 --> 10:25.458
it is my honor to introduce
the Russian ambassador

10:25.458 --> 10:28.544
to the Court of St. James's,
Oleg Balakin, to the American--

10:28.544 --> 10:29.545
That's enough.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.006
Yeah.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.010
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with me, Ambassador.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.227
I understand the United Kingdom
has shared its plans

10:45.227 --> 10:47.772
to end Lenkov Company violence in Libya.

10:51.108 --> 10:54.820
My government would like to convey
our firm expectation

10:54.820 --> 10:57.823
that this will be treated
as an isolated incident.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.160
Russian retaliation
toward the United Kingdom

11:01.160 --> 11:06.165
would inevitably draw in the United States
in support of its longtime ally.

11:17.802 --> 11:21.639
American arrogance is once again
matched only by its simplicity.

11:23.099 --> 11:27.645
By the breathtaking assumption
that a moment in time marked by tragedy

11:27.645 --> 11:29.772
can be stripped of its infinite complexity

11:29.772 --> 11:33.109
by the clarity of your dislike
for the outcome.

11:33.734 --> 11:38.030
The Lenkov Company
is a wholly independent entity,

11:38.030 --> 11:40.574
unaffiliated with the Russian government.

11:40.574 --> 11:44.328
Shall I hold you accountable
for the actions of Blackwater?

11:44.328 --> 11:45.913
Or the Proud Boys?

11:45.913 --> 11:48.582
- Sir--
- You will wait patiently

11:48.582 --> 11:52.086
through my lecture,
as I have waited countless times

11:52.086 --> 11:53.921
through the moralizing of a nation

11:53.921 --> 11:57.341
that not only manufactures
weapons of mass destruction,

11:57.341 --> 12:03.806
but sells them in establishments called,
without irony, convenience stores.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.769
The Lenkov Company,
like many organizations

12:08.769 --> 12:11.355
of well-armed illiterate men,

12:11.355 --> 12:14.650
claims to have connections
at the highest levels in the Kremlin,

12:14.650 --> 12:20.114
not unlike the sycophants who insist
they have the ear of your president,

12:20.114 --> 12:23.200
when, in fact,
they have nothing but a photo

12:23.200 --> 12:25.744
with Mr. Rayburn's least intelligent son,

12:25.744 --> 12:30.708
a post for which there appears to be
constant and spirited competition,

12:30.708 --> 12:32.835
like all such bodies...

13:20.758 --> 13:24.803
Roman Lenkov has a child
with a woman called Laurissa Safonova.

13:24.803 --> 13:29.391
She lives in a villa he owns
in Cap d'Antibes called La Colline.

13:29.391 --> 13:33.270
He will be there on the 30th of this month
for three days.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.107
When will he be there?

13:37.691 --> 13:39.860
The 30th, for three days.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.655
- Where?
- Cap d'Antibes.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.822
Villa...

13:43.822 --> 13:45.241
La Colline.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.159
La Colline.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.176
...we are not interested

14:04.176 --> 14:08.013
in indulging another excuse
for the hegemonic aspirations

14:08.013 --> 14:12.059
that live on in the increasingly
brittle memories of your president.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.270
The next time you wish to educate us

14:14.270 --> 14:18.691
as to the limits of our right to protect
our citizens, at home and abroad,

14:18.691 --> 14:23.112
please take a moment
to exercise the imagination it may take

14:23.112 --> 14:24.488
to ponder the idea

14:24.488 --> 14:27.825
that things are not as simple
as you declare them to be.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.453
That the wishes of the Kremlin
may bear no resemblance

14:31.453 --> 14:32.997
to those you believe them to be.

14:32.997 --> 14:36.417
And that the opportunity
for a peaceful and stable future

14:36.417 --> 14:40.546
is unlikely to be found in an attack
on the employees of an individual

14:40.546 --> 14:41.755
like Roman Lenkov,

14:41.755 --> 14:44.049
who is not an arm of my government,

14:44.049 --> 14:48.053
but simply an internationally recognized
common criminal.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.264
Good day, madam.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.225
And please convey my warm regards
to your president.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.485
That sounded bad.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.613
You okay?

15:08.365 --> 15:11.493
Would it be possible to speak
with the foreign secretary for a moment?

15:11.493 --> 15:14.914
I'm afraid Mr. Dennison
is quite tightly booked today.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.499
Is there anything I can help with?

15:17.499 --> 15:18.834
No, thanks.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.752
We should go.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.170
Sorry for the fuss.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.554
I'd like to stretch my legs.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.139
She's on the run.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.224
This happens.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.309
You can come.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.321
They're offering us Lenkov.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.405
The Russians.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.366
They're giving him up.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.994
He'll be in France in ten days.
They're telling us to arrest him.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.788
- What does that...?
- Mean?

15:57.373 --> 16:00.167
Either the Kremlin's fucking with us...

16:02.711 --> 16:03.963
or they didn't do it.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.255
Russia...

16:06.173 --> 16:07.508
didn't do it?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.764
<i>Hello?</i>
- Ronnie, could you tell Ms. Park

16:13.764 --> 16:16.892
that we need to have a meeting
of the Tax Structure Review Team?

16:16.892 --> 16:17.810
<i>- Today?</i>
- Yeah.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.894
- Right away.
<i>- On it.</i>

16:25.776 --> 16:27.653
That's okay. I'm just reading the paper.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.823
- Absolutely. Sorry, sir.
- No, you don't need to...

16:31.615 --> 16:33.242
What does this mean?

16:34.743 --> 16:37.788
They'd like to see you at the embassy.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.373
Who's "they"?

16:40.582 --> 16:43.377
Uh, I'm afraid I don't know.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.462
Did they say why?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.549
Again, sorry.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.385
They've just asked that you come in.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.638
Was it Kate? If it wasn't Kate,
someone should tell her they asked.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.141
I don't want her to think I'm horning in.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.518
You don't know. It's fine. Thank you.

17:00.978 --> 17:01.937
Thank you.

17:05.899 --> 17:09.194
They're giving him up.
They're telling us to arrest him.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.113
They gave me a fucking address.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.741
- And this is because...?
- They didn't do it.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.325
That's the message.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.161
They may be fucking with you.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.122
Absolutely.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.499
- Or they didn't do it.
- Yeah.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.502
Lenkov's a well-guarded guy.
Nobody ever knows where he is.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.920
This is something.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.672
Maybe they didn't do it.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.800
But they're not saying, like, Cuba did it.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.302
They're saying Lenkov did.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.512
He's a gun for hire.
Somebody else hired him.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.638
That could be anybody.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.557
Lenkov knows who hired him.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.852
They're saying arrest the guy
and he'll tell you who hired him.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.687
Or he's a scapegoat.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.065
Maybe we take the scapegoat
and call it a day.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.816
I mean, he's a bad guy.

17:47.816 --> 17:48.734
Lenkov?

17:48.734 --> 17:49.985
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.446
I need to talk to Dennison.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.033
- You need to talk to the White House.
And Langley.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.578
And I'm not sure this should happen
over airwaves. Maybe you go there.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.621
Can I just...?

18:01.997 --> 18:04.124
- Why her?
- I'm approachable.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.710
- Are you?
- Yes.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.171
The Iran thing
gave her some buzz and...

18:10.089 --> 18:11.048
And what?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.133
You're the right level.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.845
You're not nobody,
but not really somebody either.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.971
That's...

18:19.098 --> 18:20.307
fair.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.142
They don't want this going wide.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.268
The Kremlin?

18:23.268 --> 18:25.312
They love their reputation.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.023
They're badasses. They'll shoot at anyone.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.316
Ukraine, UK.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.276
They don't wanna call the White House
and say,

18:31.276 --> 18:33.821
"We're innocent
and that nasty Lenkov got us in trouble."

18:33.821 --> 18:37.574
So you quietly tell somebody
who's not really anybody.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.620
We should get somebody
from the Russia desk in here to brief you.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.206
And then let's get you on a plane to D.C.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.209
We don't know what it's about, exactly,

18:47.209 --> 18:49.962
but they asked us
to get you on a secure line.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.380
Hal?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.049
- Jesus fucking Christ.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.260
I heard you were knocking around.
I didn't believe it.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.845
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.888
- What the fuck is this?
- You're an asshole.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.306
So you around? Can I take you out?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.517
- Get you plastered?
- I'm so sorry, sir. Just--

19:03.517 --> 19:06.645
Oh. I got the White House on the horn.
She'll take your number.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.730
I'll take you out
for an overcooked English steak.

19:08.730 --> 19:09.648
Deal.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.237
<i>Morning.</i>
- Hey, Dan.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.907
<i>She's stepping in.</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:21.660
<i>Hey.</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:24.872
I'm gonna get into trouble for this.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.583
<i>- Why?</i>
- I'm trying to keep out of her hair.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.542
<i>Really?</i>

19:28.542 --> 19:30.752
<i>Is that what you did at the country house</i>

19:30.752 --> 19:33.797
<i>with the 19-part plan
to liberate Libyans in Libya?</i>

19:33.797 --> 19:35.174
Singing backup.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.384
<i>What happened with Ganon?</i>

19:37.384 --> 19:38.552
He's a fuck face.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.179
<i>Can you be more specific?</i>

19:40.179 --> 19:44.224
You know what happened.
He's launching a presidential campaign

19:44.224 --> 19:46.810
and he's trying to hide it
from a president

19:46.810 --> 19:49.813
who's stated clearly he does not like
being used as a step-stool,

19:49.813 --> 19:52.441
which is disqualifying on loyalty grounds.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.736
Much worse is
he can't even cover his own tracks,

19:55.736 --> 19:58.280
which is disqualifying
on he's-a-fucking-idiot grounds.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.533
<i>How's Kate?</i>

20:01.533 --> 20:02.951
She's good. Yeah.

20:02.951 --> 20:03.994
Great.

20:03.994 --> 20:04.912
<i>Is she?</i>

20:04.912 --> 20:05.996
Yeah.

20:05.996 --> 20:09.208
<i>Is the VP idea taking root?</i>

20:10.667 --> 20:12.294
Uh, yeah, it is, actually.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.212
I think it is.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.130
<i>She did what she set out to do.</i>

20:15.130 --> 20:17.132
<i>She made London into a real job.</i>

20:17.132 --> 20:21.595
Yeah, she did.
She's turned it into something pivotal.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.097
<i>- You're proud.</i>
- Yeah, I am.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.433
She deserves it.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.935
And she's good at it.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.019
<i>Good.</i>

20:30.020 --> 20:32.731
- That's it?
<i>- I just wanna make sure she's solid.</i>

20:33.315 --> 20:35.943
<i>'Cause things are gonna get bumpy.</i>

20:37.819 --> 20:38.737
Why?

20:40.614 --> 20:43.158
I'm glad we're not going to war
with Russia.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.451
Oh, yeah?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.203
I wasn't up for it.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.622
I think we were all pretty freaked out.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.332
People...

20:52.834 --> 20:57.464
I heard somebody talking about
getting, like, a dog.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.758
- Or a baby.
- No.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.345
Because we were gonna
go to war with Russia?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.388
Apocalypse babies.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.348
- That's a terrible idea.
- Isn't it?

21:06.348 --> 21:07.808
War with Russia is nuclear.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.810
Those babies are gonna get irradiated.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.395
It's fucking ridiculous.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.273
I like dogs, though.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.277
Did you start, like,
trolling for strays online?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.278
No.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.405
I kind of knew.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.657
That they didn't do it.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.200
- Russia?
Yeah.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.079
Everyone in the Russian establishment
was like, "We did it.

21:29.079 --> 21:32.207
Not my office,
but clearly, something we'd do."

21:32.207 --> 21:34.876
We couldn't find the origin of the order.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.921
Intelligence chiefs, oligarchs, generals,

21:37.921 --> 21:39.756
nobody was read in.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.175
And these are people who are read in.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.260
That's weird.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.971
It's less weird if Russia didn't do it.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.597
Ah. Yeah.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.892
You can still get a dog.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.185
I don't want a dog.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.064
- The Russia guy?
- Yeah, you ready?

21:56.064 --> 21:58.233
- Yeah.
- We're not telling the Russia guy?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.652
We're not.
We're asking questions about Lenkov.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.405
Which we'd have asked even if
we were still going with the Libya plan.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.448
Okay.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.658
Carly Green from the Russia desk.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.536
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.246
Is Carly...?

22:11.246 --> 22:12.539
The Russia person.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.916
- Okay. Great.
- I'm older than I look.

22:14.916 --> 22:18.128
- You'd have to be.
- I was number six at the Russia desk,

22:18.128 --> 22:20.964
then everyone got moved
to Langley or Kyiv.

22:20.964 --> 22:21.965
Wow.

22:21.965 --> 22:25.302
The Agency spent 25 years
training Middle East specialists.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.305
Then it was all-hands on Russia.
There weren't a lot of hands to be had.

22:28.305 --> 22:32.184
- Those of us who speak Russian moved up.
- Is your background Cold War or post-'91?

22:32.184 --> 22:35.645
Uh, my background is Tolstoy's influence
on the later work of Chekhov.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.276
- Sorry. Ma'am, could you--?
- Not a great time. Can it wait?

22:41.276 --> 22:43.111
- Uh--
- Is it Mr. Hayford?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.238
No. It's Mr. Wyler.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.163
- Are you fucking kidding me?
No.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.248
When you said you didn't know
where the line is,

22:55.248 --> 22:56.958
it's like eight feet behind you.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.336
The president wants to fire
the secretary of state.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.923
- Because of her?
No.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.425
What, are you fucking stupid?
- It's not because of you.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.427
It absolutely is.
I served him up on a platter.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.471
Let me put this
in the way you would to me.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.809
The narcissism involved
in assuming that you managed

23:13.809 --> 23:16.770
- to get the secretary of state canned--
- He's not canned, right?

23:16.770 --> 23:19.523
No. But I don't like his odds.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.941
Fuck me.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.527
The president has been waiting
for Miguel Ganon

23:23.527 --> 23:25.695
to stab him in the back
since the day he hired him.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.115
He's secretary of state
'cause you keep your enemies closer.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.409
I thought he'd get benched for a week.
I didn't want him fired.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.245
- It'll fuck up his whole life.
- No.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.206
He does this chin tucking thing
every time the president talks.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.124
Ganon?

23:37.124 --> 23:40.418
It's like he's trying to disappear
down his own neck.

23:40.418 --> 23:41.795
The man's not subtle.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.047
Try not to sound excited. Okay?

23:46.675 --> 23:48.051
I gotta get on a plane.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.886
- Where?
D.C.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.721
What, because of Ganon?
- No.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.058
You can't march into the Oval Office
and demand he doesn't fire Ganon.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.936
- It's not why I'm going.
- Why are you going?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.897
Sweetheart, it's fucking classified.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.361
You'll head straight to Langley
from the airport,

24:06.361 --> 24:08.363
brief Michelle, brief Roger Post.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.408
They'll put it through the mill while you
go to State to brief Tim and Ganon.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.535
Okay. Say what you just said to me.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.079
She goes to Langley
to brief Roger and Michelle.

24:16.079 --> 24:19.082
They'll put it through the mill
while she goes to brief Tim and Ganon.

24:19.082 --> 24:23.170
- Oh. Can somebody else brief Ganon?
- Tim can brief Ganon.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.462
I guess.

24:24.462 --> 24:27.716
It's a big get.
You sure you don't wanna bring it in?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.885
Ah, might be better coming from Tim.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.804
I'm on his shit list.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.514
- Ganon's?
- It's fine.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.809
Okay. Tim brings it through State,

24:37.809 --> 24:39.936
you go to the White House,
brief in the Oval.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.107
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.318
Just a big pivot after all that.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.195
- Yeah.
Trowbridge will hate it.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.030
That's tomorrow's problem.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.158
Today, you wanna show the Russians
we're taking the tip seriously.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.869
Hand-delivering it to D.C.
is a meaningful sign.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.329
Who tells Trowbridge?

24:57.329 --> 25:00.207
I'm heading to MI6
as soon as you're in the air.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.751
- They'll bring it to Number 10.
- And Dennison?

25:03.668 --> 25:04.961
They'll tell him.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.052
We've built a relationship.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.387
I'm here to tell him things.
That's the point.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.478
Don't look at me
like I'm being a shit.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.771
You are.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.690
The president's watching you.
You can't be wringing your hands

25:25.690 --> 25:28.193
'cause you just discovered
actions have consequences.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.278
- This is the bigs.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.201
For the trip.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.332
I prefer black.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.833
I'm aware of that.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.509
- I'm starting at the beginning?
- They know what you told me.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.928
- But if they have questions...
- Got it.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.515
- What'd you have for lunch?
- Um...

25:59.224 --> 26:01.434
- Yogurt.
- You're wearing it.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.727
Hi.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.229
You, for a second.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.732
- Fuck.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.169
No. No, no, no.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.631
- No, no.
Kate?

26:32.590 --> 26:35.010
- Jill. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

26:36.845 --> 26:37.804
I didn't pee.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.931
- Okay.
- This.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.058
- Oh.
- This suit is not black.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.768
Do you want a towel?

26:43.768 --> 26:45.603
No. It'll probably air dry.

26:47.022 --> 26:50.066
- Maybe cover it.
- Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.235
Are you around? Can we get a drink?

26:52.235 --> 26:54.112
- Ambassador?
- Yeah, sure.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.155
Um...

26:55.864 --> 26:58.074
I-- I'll call you after this.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.326
Okay.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.786
Tell me we confirmed her tip.
We confirmed.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.663
With who?
Source in Prague.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.707
He took a trip to Coventry. It lines up.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.419
Good to see each and every one of you.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.421
Anything we didn't know an hour ago?

27:11.421 --> 27:13.548
We're double sourced.
Thoughts?

27:13.548 --> 27:15.300
- We're a yes.
- Same.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.803
- France will light their hair on fire.
- We're getting into it.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.848
They like to be asked and say no
a few times before they say yes.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.642
- We'll make a fuss, make it feel good.
- How about the Brits?

27:24.642 --> 27:26.227
- They'll get there.
- The--

27:26.227 --> 27:29.230
Are we putting a pin in the Libya plan
or full-on scrapping it?

27:29.230 --> 27:31.858
- No pin.
The PM isn't gonna love this.

27:31.858 --> 27:35.695
His agenda on the domestic side makes
the previous option a lot more attractive.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.365
- Until we've spoken to him--
- Secretary Ganon did.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.200
He's in?
- He'll get there.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.744
I don't love cleaning house
for the Kremlin.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.538
It's the Brits, and the alternative
was a harebrained scheme

27:45.538 --> 27:47.290
to lose our pants in Libya.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.002
- Talk to the French.
- Thanks, everybody.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.380
Really great work. Danny? Tokyo.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.964
Make it clear we're not happy.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.092
Why can't Australia scold Tokyo?

27:57.092 --> 27:58.885
Australia doesn't wanna get involved.

27:58.885 --> 27:59.886
Neither do I.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.514
The president can weigh in
but if it'll eat the meeting...

28:02.514 --> 28:03.431
It shouldn't.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.040
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.834
No, don't worry. I was early.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.920
The meeting ended sooner than I thought.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.130
Oval Office.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.507
- Fancy-pants-y.
- Yeah, fuck that.

28:39.968 --> 28:40.927
Hi.

28:41.886 --> 28:42.971
So how's it going?

28:42.971 --> 28:45.056
I mean, have you been over there?

28:45.056 --> 28:47.267
Ah, I've been to Doha.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.102
They won't let me into Kabul.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.814
- They were gonna let all of us in.
- They were.

28:52.814 --> 28:56.735
And then when your appointment
got scrapped, they pushed pause.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.278
Shit.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.823
Have you talked to Bazya?

29:01.823 --> 29:03.116
No.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.703
I wanted to call her, but things got so...

29:06.703 --> 29:08.496
- Busy?
- Insane.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.706
I'm sure.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.208
- I'll call her.
- You don't have to call her.

29:12.208 --> 29:15.378
- No. Of course I'm gonna fucking call her.
- Bazya doesn't have a phone.

29:15.378 --> 29:18.006
They took away her phone and her computer.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.048
Fuck.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.885
She's not allowed to leave
the house without Hussein.

29:21.885 --> 29:25.263
Hey, excuse me?
Do you have a chardonnay? Thanks.

29:26.347 --> 29:27.766
So, what are you doing?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.392
Trying to get people out.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.436
How many are still left?

29:31.436 --> 29:34.814
Uh, people who can prove
that they worked for us

29:34.814 --> 29:38.151
and have a legitimate fear for their lives
if they stay in the country?

29:38.151 --> 29:39.736
About 35,000.

29:40.987 --> 29:44.282
- I wanna hear what you're doing in London.
- I'm doing nothing.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.700
Did Par get out?

29:45.700 --> 29:47.994
- Kate, well...
- Yes or no?

29:49.621 --> 29:53.583
She went to a protest and the Taliban beat
the shit out of her with a rubber pipe.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.877
But only on her boobs and her crotch,

29:55.877 --> 29:59.172
so she couldn't take pictures
to prove to anyone that it had happened.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.424
Then she went to another protest,

30:01.424 --> 30:03.927
and they took her away.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.512
Probably she's dead.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.016
We like to think she's in jail.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.444
It's smart.
Two of you for the price of one.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.614
- It's just Kate. It is.
- Ah? Are you really not helping?

30:24.614 --> 30:28.576
You're not telling her how to suck up to
Brussels without emasculating the French?

30:28.576 --> 30:30.161
She doesn't need my help.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.539
Yeah? Well, curl up with me
and talk about my problems.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.374
Come work at the Institute.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.835
I'm surrounded by children
with PhDs in history,

30:36.835 --> 30:39.420
trying to teach me the lessons of Vietnam.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.840
- That's gotta have an upside.
- It doesn't.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.800
You can't fuck anybody anymore.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.760
You can't even marry anybody.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.763
That shit you pulled with Kate?
Keep it quiet for months,

30:48.763 --> 30:50.557
then invite everybody to the wedding?

30:50.557 --> 30:52.934
- Those days are over.
- Saddest story I ever heard.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.770
Whitehall is a mess.
The SNP want our nukes out of Scotland.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.398
GCHQ is shitting their pants about China.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.732
There's a ton of work for you.

30:59.732 --> 31:03.111
I'd love to.
But I'm not ready to take a job.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.740
Are you replacing Ganon?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.287
What are you talking about?

31:12.287 --> 31:15.623
Ganon burned the president on something.
Larry said it was about Mexico.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.876
Larry? Larry makes shit up.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.960
Yeah?

31:20.003 --> 31:22.797
The secretary of state
takes a long walk off a short pier...

31:24.048 --> 31:25.300
it should be you.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.013
Can you get this guy another drink,
see if we can get him to pass out?

31:36.603 --> 31:37.687
Still not back?

31:37.687 --> 31:39.105
She's in the elevator.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.359
Welcome back.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.654
- Why don't I send Dr. Brady up?
- Byron, I swear to God.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.115
- I suggested we start at the house.
- What's going on?

31:49.115 --> 31:52.201
Byron's never seen a woman
with a hangover before.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.414
Welcome back.
- Morning, Ronnie.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.916
It's not morning, ma'am.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.002
The prime minister wants
to see you in an hour.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.178
Where?

32:11.304 --> 32:13.556
Uh, he has an event at the IoD.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.558
He'll find a minute to step out.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.901
Is Dennison gonna be there?

32:25.526 --> 32:26.778
I don't know.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.196
Well, he should be.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.324
The PM is gonna lose his fucking mind.

32:31.324 --> 32:34.118
Somebody taught me
that if you are really tired

32:34.118 --> 32:35.870
and you change your shoes,

32:35.870 --> 32:38.039
you trick your body
into thinking it's morning.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.085
Maybe change your shoes...
and everything else.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.425
Do you see this?

32:50.802 --> 32:51.970
Yeah, I do.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.389
This is why I wear a black suit.

32:55.139 --> 32:58.810
This doesn't show on a black suit.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.356
It makes me look insane.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.653
- How about I get you something black?
- Great.

33:11.572 --> 33:12.907
Pants.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.535
No fucking dresses.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.917
- Yeah?

33:31.759 --> 33:35.013
They marched into Ukraine,
and thought to buy our assent

33:35.638 --> 33:37.140
with the price of petrol.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.642
We thought, no.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.520
We ended the import of Russian oil.

33:44.063 --> 33:47.692
And though the winds grew cold
and fuel grew dear,

33:47.692 --> 33:49.902
our homes blazed forth

33:49.902 --> 33:52.989
- with the bright lights of freedom.
- Yeah, just hang on. I'm stepping outside.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.158
Cold winds blew through the land...

33:56.075 --> 33:58.077
No, still here. Yeah.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.540
Thank you.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.645
- Twelve minutes.
- Prime Minister.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.106
Twelve minutes

34:27.106 --> 34:30.693
after I told Libya I was saving them
from the Lenkov troops.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.654
That's when I got the Ganon call.

34:34.739 --> 34:38.326
I had already accepted Libya's thanks,
kissed the royal ring.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.245
And 12 minutes later,

34:41.996 --> 34:45.833
in a phone call lasting one minute
and 42 seconds, thank you kindly,

34:45.833 --> 34:48.920
Ganon told me,
in no uncertain terms, to pull back.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.217
Turned the words to soap in my mouth.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.845
Informed me to inform Libya to sit tight

34:57.845 --> 35:00.723
whilst the Americans
changed our minds for us.

35:00.723 --> 35:03.976
The president wants
what's best for the UK.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.228
Don't embarrass yourself.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.396
He didn't feel
we could ignore the possibility

35:07.396 --> 35:09.941
that the Russian state
was not behind the attack.

35:09.941 --> 35:13.152
We're not going after the Russian state.
We're going after naughty mercenaries.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.570
Does this ring a bell?

35:14.570 --> 35:16.864
If there is any way to de-escalate--

35:16.864 --> 35:18.950
What happened to deterrence?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.868
- He lost interest?
- No.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.746
I was led to believe--
by, if memory serves, you--

35:23.746 --> 35:27.542
that the president also thought
that peace in Libya was worth our time.

35:28.251 --> 35:31.546
Does he believe that the arrest
of some nameless Russian mafioso

35:31.546 --> 35:35.341
by a posse of frogs will answer
the deaths of 40 servicemen?

35:35.341 --> 35:39.178
If we bring in Lenkov,
he will tell us who actually hired him.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.888
That will take forever.

35:41.848 --> 35:45.643
The president understands that,
and he's not thrilled about it.

35:45.643 --> 35:49.397
I told Ganon, in no uncertain terms,
that an extended delay was not acceptable.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.191
It was not responsive
to the needs of the United Kingdom.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.110
Ganon brought up your concerns.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.195
And so did I.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.407
To the president?

35:59.407 --> 36:01.159
In the Oval Office.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.746
Nobody is ignoring the trade-offs.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.752
The president is incredibly grateful
for your patience.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.091
He does not have it.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.180
There was something refreshing
about the days

36:22.180 --> 36:25.057
when America looked us in the face
and said we should go fuck ourselves.

36:26.142 --> 36:29.812
Now we're back to getting
dry-buggered and told it's love.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.831
- How did it go?
Great.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.336
Did you talk about the vice presidency?

36:53.961 --> 36:54.795
No.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.423
Not even with Billie?

36:57.423 --> 36:58.341
Nope.

37:02.011 --> 37:03.721
She say anything about Ganon?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.473
She did not.

37:08.517 --> 37:09.977
Did you ask?

37:09.977 --> 37:13.981
I said no words, Hal.
Not to the president, not to Billie.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.568
I briefed at Langley.
They put my information into the mill.

37:17.568 --> 37:21.405
I was in the Oval Office
with 90 other people for 40 seconds,

37:21.405 --> 37:23.157
and then I was gone.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.117
Oh, shit.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.912
Then Trowbridge requested my presence

37:27.912 --> 37:32.291
for a blow-by-blow of how the plan
I shoved down his throat vaporized.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.126
- Libya?
- They're going another way.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.128
- A better way?
- Not if you ask Trowbridge.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.340
- What did you say?
- I said I tried.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.926
I said the president feels his pain.

37:41.926 --> 37:45.221
I said I fell to my knees
in front of the Resolute Desk

37:45.221 --> 37:47.431
and begged the president to reconsider.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.684
But on further reflection,

37:49.684 --> 37:54.272
it's clear that this is really
what's best for the United Kingdom.

37:55.106 --> 38:00.069
I definitely didn't say I stood quietly
in the Oval like a fucking moron

38:00.069 --> 38:02.613
while Ganon drove a tractor over my face.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.041
I saw Jill.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.254
Klein?

38:23.134 --> 38:23.968
Bad?

38:26.721 --> 38:28.556
What the fuck do you think?

38:36.022 --> 38:39.233
I need to call Dennison
and tell him where we're at.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.325
Bit late, no?

38:50.328 --> 38:54.081
Trowbridge is gonna
try to blow it all up, so...

38:59.920 --> 39:01.839
You can call him in the morning.
