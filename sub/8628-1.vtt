Hello.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.182
Hello.

01:51.394 --> 01:52.952
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:53.163 --> 01:55.529
That's what we do at Club Indigo.

01:55.732 --> 01:57.529
The more you drink,
the better I look.

01:57.734 --> 02:00.396
And the more you drink,
the better your date's gonna look.

02:00.603 --> 02:02.571
A couple of you guys
valet parked your cars.

02:02.772 --> 02:05.798
Well, you need to make good friends,
you're gonna need a ride home.

02:06.009 --> 02:07.772
We don't have valet here.

02:07.977 --> 02:09.342
Anybody valet?

02:09.545 --> 02:10.535
You need a ride home.

02:12.148 --> 02:16.676
This is one of the baddest sisters
around. This black gal can sing!

02:16.886 --> 02:19.514
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll try to show some love.

02:19.722 --> 02:23.749
Put those hands together for
the one and only, not May, not June...

02:23.960 --> 02:28.192
...but April. Give it up for Miss April!

03:50.914 --> 03:53.041
Damn Joe better sit--

03:55.018 --> 03:58.715
I know ain't nobody
breaking in this house.

04:01.257 --> 04:03.191

04:03.393 --> 04:05.190
...they gonna break in my house.

04:05.395 --> 04:08.262
I'm Madea,
and they gonna break in this house?

04:09.365 --> 04:10.389
Oh, hell no.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.794
Oh, see you later, Helmer.

04:15.138 --> 04:18.403
-Joe.
-Now roll the joint up.

04:22.378 --> 04:23.811
Joe.

04:24.847 --> 04:28.613
Mabel, what the hell wrong with you?
You don't be coming--

04:30.420 --> 04:32.047
Wake the hell up.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.084
You about to give me a heart attack.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.087
You too ugly
to be waking somebody up...

04:36.292 --> 04:38.385
...in the middle of the night,
I told you that.

04:38.594 --> 04:40.459
You gotta ease that ugly
up on people.

04:40.663 --> 04:42.631
You can't just show it to them
all at once.

04:42.832 --> 04:45.699
Code five, fool. Code five. Hurry up.

04:45.902 --> 04:48.632
-Get out the bed.
-Code five? Hell, go get them, Mabel.

04:48.838 --> 04:52.296
-Hell, you look like armed services.
-Hurry up.

04:52.508 --> 04:55.341
Ain't nothing in here but me.
This is your house.

04:57.847 --> 05:01.783
Wait a minute. My weed down there.
Oh, hell no now.

05:02.418 --> 05:05.410
Is this worth you getting
a cap busted in your ass for?

05:08.858 --> 05:11.793
-What the hell?
-Did they done drop my damn VCR?

05:12.595 --> 05:15.496
What you doing with my--?
Not your TiVo.

05:15.698 --> 05:18.531
Sit your ass down!
Wait, this is from me.

05:20.269 --> 05:22.533
Hold on, Joe. Hell.

05:25.508 --> 05:26.497

06:25.968 --> 06:27.595
Clap your hands, girls!

06:31.474 --> 06:33.874
Y'all eating like y'all ain't ate nothing
in days.

06:34.077 --> 06:36.477
I don't know why the hell you feeding
these children.

06:36.679 --> 06:39.512
You feed them, they gonna
keep coming back, just like roaches.

06:39.715 --> 06:41.683
You got one roach,
you gonna have thousands.

06:41.884 --> 06:44.284
You never gonna be able
to get rid of these children.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.785
You ain't been able
to get rid of what you got.

06:49.725 --> 06:51.420
Scratch and sniff.

06:51.627 --> 06:56.121
Shut your mouth. I was in
a experiment with-- In Tuskegee.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.197
-You want some more sandwich?
-Yeah.

06:58.401 --> 07:01.461
-You say "yes, ma'am" to me.
-Yes, man.

07:03.573 --> 07:05.803
He say "yes, man."

07:06.776 --> 07:08.403
No, son, that ain't--

07:08.611 --> 07:10.875
That ain't no man.
She just look like one.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.412
-You say "yes, ma'am."
-What does that mean?

07:13.616 --> 07:15.846
Don't know what's wrong
with these children today.

07:16.052 --> 07:19.818
Ain't nobody teach you some respect?
"Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. No, sir"?

07:20.022 --> 07:21.455
-Nobody teach you that?
-No.

07:21.657 --> 07:24.626
Somebody should've. I don't know
what's wrong with parents today.

07:25.261 --> 07:26.626
Hey, slow the hell down, boy.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.592
Wipe your mouth.
What the hell's wrong?

07:28.798 --> 07:31.130
-He crazy?
-No.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.363
What's wrong with him?

07:33.569 --> 07:35.537
-He's a weirdo.
-Eat your food and shut up.

07:35.738 --> 07:38.138
Girl, eat something.
Get you some butter and jelly.

07:38.341 --> 07:40.639
No, I'm good.
Just wanna make sure they eat.

07:40.843 --> 07:42.140
I'm mad as hell about my VCR.

07:42.345 --> 07:45.337
I'm trying to be nice to you,
but I'm mad as hell about this VCR.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.847
I ought to shank you.
This is my VCR.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.384
I had this VCR back in 1 973...

07:52.588 --> 07:55.386
...when Otis Redding came by
and he sat there with me...

07:55.591 --> 07:58.287
...and both of us watched
a movie on this VCR...

07:58.494 --> 08:00.359
...and you just drop it
like it's nothing.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.657
This is a antique, girl.
You know what a antique is?

08:03.866 --> 08:06.300
There one right there.
This is a antique.

08:06.502 --> 08:08.732
-Still gonna call the cops?
-Hell, yeah.

08:08.938 --> 08:11.964
You done broke in somebody's house.
Just because you looking sad...

08:12.175 --> 08:16.544
...you don't think nobody gonna call
the police? I'm calling the po-po.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.909
It's tore up, anyway. I don't see
no reason for you to call the cops.

08:20.116 --> 08:23.483
Don't tell me not to call the cops.
If I wanna call the cops, I'm gonna.

08:23.686 --> 08:25.984
I might not call
if you done learned your lesson.

08:26.189 --> 08:28.487
The lesson is simple.
You can ask people for stuff.

08:28.691 --> 08:30.659
You ain't gotta be
trying to steal nothing.

08:30.860 --> 08:33.192
I'm feeding you
out of the kindness of my heart.

08:33.395 --> 08:36.422
I'm doing the good Christian thing,
doing what Jesus would've did.

08:36.631 --> 08:38.691
I'm feeding you.
My daughter would be proud...

08:38.900 --> 08:41.369
...feeding the people
that came in here to steal.

08:41.571 --> 08:45.166
All this stuff going on in the world,
I can help y'all if you ask me to help.

08:45.374 --> 08:47.103
Ain't gotta come
breaking in the house.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.278
People are working hard
for what they got...

08:49.478 --> 08:51.537
...and you gonna break up
in somebody's house.

08:51.747 --> 08:54.238
-What's wrong with y'all?
-Hey, Big Bird, calm down.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.283
Making me upset, stealing
and break into somebody's house.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.852
-You hear me, boy?
-Yes, man.

09:05.394 --> 09:06.827
Boy, you're cute.

09:07.029 --> 09:09.224
He said it again.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.924
He said--

09:13.936 --> 09:17.269
You said it again.
Boy, you funny. You is funny.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.873
That ain't no man.
You can't say "yes, man."

09:20.076 --> 09:21.907
But that's what--

09:22.945 --> 09:24.606
Yes, ma'am. Yes, dude.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.872
As in, yes, sir.

09:26.082 --> 09:27.379
As in, yes, dude.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.608
As in, yes, bro.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.013
Where are your people?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.279
-My grandma--
-She's at work.

09:33.789 --> 09:35.222
Is that what you was gonna say?

09:35.424 --> 09:37.187
-No.
-Yes.

09:38.394 --> 09:41.761
-They lying.
-You know I can hear you, right?

09:42.832 --> 09:45.926
Let this child talk to me
before I choke you out.

09:49.372 --> 09:51.863
We haven't seen our grandma
in four days.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.371
Four days?

09:53.576 --> 09:54.873
Why? Is she on that stuff?

09:55.077 --> 09:56.977
No, she went to work
like she always do...

09:57.179 --> 09:58.874
...but this time,
she never came back.

09:59.081 --> 10:02.312
Manny, can you just shut up
and eat your food, please?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.645
This child can talk to me
if he want to.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.312
-Where your mom at?
-Dead. My grandma's at work.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.288
-Where's she work at?
-I don't know.

10:11.494 --> 10:14.793
-Y'all ain't got no living relative?
-We got an aunt.

10:15.331 --> 10:17.458
April. April.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.729
-Hey.
-Girl, wake up.

10:19.935 --> 10:22.426
I'm up. I'm here.

10:23.472 --> 10:24.905
Where did everybody go?

10:25.107 --> 10:28.076
Home. It's past closing.

10:28.744 --> 10:32.145
-Did Randy come get me?
-No, I ain't seen no Randy.

10:32.348 --> 10:34.111
Give me one more drink
while I wait.

10:34.317 --> 10:36.342
Girl, you had enough. Get up...

10:36.552 --> 10:39.214
-...and go now.
-lf you love me, give me another drink.

10:39.422 --> 10:41.447
I love you.
I can't give you another drink.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.887
Okay. All right. Okay.
I'm gone. I'm gone.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.355
-Have it your way.
-Hurry up.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.689
-Hey.
-Be careful.

10:51.334 --> 10:53.268
-Good night.
-Good night.

10:53.936 --> 10:55.631
-Oh, hey, April.
-Hey.

10:55.838 --> 10:57.567
You got some money?

10:57.773 --> 11:00.139
Man, didn't I just give you
some money?

11:00.343 --> 11:01.810
Yes, I did.

11:02.011 --> 11:03.205
Don't lie. Don't lie.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.848
Hey, hey! Hold it! Hold it!

11:07.049 --> 11:10.416
Man, superstar coming through.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.691
Should I get this? Wifey's calling.

11:26.902 --> 11:29.462
Shit, I wish you would.

11:29.672 --> 11:31.970
I dare you. Put it down.

11:32.174 --> 11:34.039
You need to fix
the floor in the bathroom.

11:34.243 --> 11:36.040
Everything in this damn house
is broken.

11:36.245 --> 11:38.907
Well, when I get some money to fix it,
I'll fix it.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.379
But until then,
what you get is raggedy.

11:41.884 --> 11:43.044
Who's snapping?

11:45.321 --> 11:46.982
Hello?

11:47.189 --> 11:48.781
Hey, baby.

11:51.026 --> 11:53.961
No. No, I ain't off--

11:55.297 --> 11:57.390
-You did? Stop.
-Stop.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.067
You what?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.033
Janice, I told you....

12:03.239 --> 12:06.868
No, I know that. Look, I'm happy.

12:07.076 --> 12:10.239
Look, I said I'm happy.
Yeah, okay. I'll call you later.

12:10.446 --> 12:14.212
-Yeah, you sound real happy.
-She's pregnant.

12:16.218 --> 12:17.242
Congratulations.

12:17.453 --> 12:21.355
April, you know good and damn well
I don't want no more kids.

12:21.557 --> 12:23.752
I can barely pay
the damn bills in my house.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.054
And yours.

12:26.796 --> 12:30.232
What the hell am I gonna do
with some more kids, huh?

12:30.433 --> 12:34.699
I got four already. I can't even handle
this damn child support.

12:34.904 --> 12:37.304
-Killing my ass.
-Whose fault is that?

12:38.474 --> 12:39.463
What did you say?

12:43.646 --> 12:45.045
Nothing.

12:45.247 --> 12:47.442
-You said something.
-Nothing. Baby, nothing.

12:47.650 --> 12:48.708
It's nothing.

12:48.918 --> 12:49.907
Nothing.

12:50.119 --> 12:51.313
-Nothing?
-No.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.545
What, you gonna tell me
you pregnant now?

12:53.756 --> 12:57.248
You know I don't want kids.
All I want is you.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.951
Well, good. Come on.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.899
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

13:07.102 --> 13:08.433
You know I love you, right?

13:09.071 --> 13:10.868
Me too.

13:11.707 --> 13:15.666
Now, go tell wifey I said hi.
Kiss the kids for me.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.837
-That's funny.
-I'm serious. Tell wifey I said hi.

13:20.516 --> 13:22.211
I'm going to sleep.

13:31.527 --> 13:33.017
This better be the right address.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.323
If I go one more place, and y'all
done sent me to the wrong place...

13:36.532 --> 13:39.968
...I'm gonna hurt somebody.
Get on out of the car, little boy.

13:40.169 --> 13:42.194
Come on, girl, with that attitude.

13:47.977 --> 13:50.707
You call that a knock?
Bang on the door and step down here.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.986
Somebody gonna open this door,
I don't care.

14:01.190 --> 14:04.250
-Okay!
-Kick the door, kick it.

14:04.460 --> 14:07.657
What the hell y'all banging my door
for at this time of the morning?

14:07.863 --> 14:09.057
It's 7 a.m.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.233
I don't know who you think
you talking to...

14:11.433 --> 14:13.958
...but it is 1 2:30 in the afternoon.

14:14.169 --> 14:16.569
-Do you know these children, hooker?
-No.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.330
Aunt April.

14:18.841 --> 14:20.172
Snitch.

14:20.376 --> 14:23.311
All right, that's my niece
and my nephews. What did y'all do?

14:23.512 --> 14:25.207
They broke into my house...

14:25.414 --> 14:27.473
...and broke my VCR
trying to steal something.

14:27.683 --> 14:29.708
I want my money.
That's why I brought them.

14:29.919 --> 14:31.580
These are not my kids.
You know what?

14:31.787 --> 14:34.688
-Take them to my mama.
-Hold the hell on.

14:34.890 --> 14:37.654
They ain't seen your mama
in four days.

14:38.427 --> 14:40.827
-That's not like her. Where is she?
-They don't know.

14:41.030 --> 14:43.863
Hell, why I'm supposed to know?
I don't know. I don't know her.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.762
Okay, my sister is dead.
Their mama, she dead.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.630
And so my mother is raising them...

14:48.837 --> 14:51.533
...and that's who you should talk to
to get your money.

14:51.740 --> 14:54.868
If she ain't there, you better get me
the $300 and get my VCR.

14:55.077 --> 14:56.339
That's all I'm telling you.

14:56.545 --> 14:59.605
I'm telling you I don't have $300,
and these ain't my kids.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.875
Let me explain something to you.
If you don't give me my money...

15:03.085 --> 15:05.519
...I'm calling the po-po
on all three of these thugs.

15:05.721 --> 15:07.120
You can use my phone.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.190
Help us, Aunt April.
We tried to find Grandma.

15:13.729 --> 15:15.594
What if I bring them
over to your house...

15:15.798 --> 15:17.390
...and they can work the money off?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.363
-Work it off? Hell, no.
-Clean up?

15:19.568 --> 15:21.433
-What do you mean "what"?
-No, no.

15:21.637 --> 15:24.401
I want my $300.
You gonna bring them to work for me?

15:24.607 --> 15:26.700
You can't bring them to my house
to do nothing.

15:26.909 --> 15:29.309
I got a white woman next door to me
and I have a dog.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.569
You know what that mean?

15:30.779 --> 15:34.044
I don't wanna let O.J.
and Michael Vick at my house.

15:34.416 --> 15:37.214
Well, I don't know what to tell you,
because I don't have--

15:37.419 --> 15:38.750
Fine. Fine.

15:38.954 --> 15:40.717
Make sure
they be over at my house.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.220
That thing ain't even worth--

15:42.424 --> 15:44.915
Say something else.
I want you to say something-- Say--

15:45.127 --> 15:48.426
Snatch away from me,
I'm gonna punch you like I dude.

15:48.631 --> 15:50.155
Say something.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.600
Come in here.

15:56.238 --> 15:59.207
Little O.J., that thug and
Sister Souljah, she know where I live.

15:59.408 --> 16:02.309
-Make sure they be at my house.
-Yeah.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.638
Where is your grandmother?

16:06.849 --> 16:08.976
-We don't know.
-Y'all can't stay here.

16:09.184 --> 16:11.049
Okay, I got a man,
and he don't like kids.

16:11.253 --> 16:13.483
So y'all gonna have
to figure something else out.

16:13.689 --> 16:16.590
All right, y'all can't stay here.
So where is she?

16:16.792 --> 16:18.760
You can't smoke around him.
He has asthma.

16:18.961 --> 16:21.759
Girl, this is my house.
You can wait outside.

16:21.964 --> 16:23.591
-Fine, then. We will.
-Good.

16:23.799 --> 16:27.667
Wait, we ain't been to sleep all night.
I'm tired.

16:27.870 --> 16:30.304
Well, y'all can stay here, but I'm out.

16:30.506 --> 16:34.567
Get up out of here with that attitude.
Come on. Get to stepping.

16:35.044 --> 16:37.604
-Hey, look, I'll see y'all later, okay?
-All right.

16:38.213 --> 16:39.305
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

16:40.315 --> 16:43.307
Puffy and Biggie,
y'all don't wanna go with Lil' Kim?

16:44.253 --> 16:47.654
-Nope, I'm going to sleep.
-I'm going to bed. Y'all shut up.

16:47.856 --> 16:50.484
Don't make no noise.
I gotta work tonight.

16:53.629 --> 16:55.494
Oh, okay. Good.

16:55.698 --> 16:58.394
Bless you.
God bless you, and come again.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.192
Glad we could help.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.364
-Hi.
-Hello.

17:04.573 --> 17:07.633
I am from Pastor Hector Romalle's
church in Columbia.

17:07.843 --> 17:11.744
-You used to run missions there.
-That was a long time ago.

17:11.946 --> 17:15.007
-What's your full name?
-Sandino. Sandino Ramirez.

17:15.217 --> 17:18.414
You seemed to be doing so well there.
What are you doing here?

17:18.887 --> 17:21.412
I've come to this country
to find a better life.

17:21.623 --> 17:25.525
To find some work.
Not having much luck.

17:25.928 --> 17:28.726
I remember you're here,
I wanted to see if you could help me.

17:29.198 --> 17:32.395
Got any special skills?
What is it that you do?

17:33.235 --> 17:35.203
I'm a handyman.

17:35.404 --> 17:37.395
We have some things around
need to be fixed.

17:37.606 --> 17:40.871
Got plenty of tools,
plenty of supplies.

17:41.076 --> 17:43.374
Don't have much pay,
but we will pay you something.

17:43.579 --> 17:45.547
Stop! Come here!
Stupid, come here!

17:46.115 --> 17:48.606
-Deacon, Deacon, stop that girl.
-Hold on now.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.251
-Come here.
-Let go of me.

17:51.453 --> 17:53.250
If I ever catch you
in my store again--

17:53.455 --> 17:56.720
Miller, Miller, I got it.
I'm gonna take care of it.

17:56.925 --> 17:58.916
Hey, you'd better, pastor.

18:00.763 --> 18:03.732
-Young lady, are you on drugs?
-No. Why?

18:03.932 --> 18:06.457
-Where are your parents?
-I don't got no parents.

18:08.437 --> 18:09.426
Jennifer?

18:10.439 --> 18:12.532
-Miss Wilma.
-You know this child?

18:12.741 --> 18:14.368
Yeah.

18:14.576 --> 18:18.034
That's Rose's granddaughter.
She lives next door to me.

18:18.247 --> 18:20.545
Your grandmother's
a member of this church.

18:20.749 --> 18:22.614
-Well, have you seen her?
-Not in a while.

18:22.818 --> 18:25.286
-You don't know where she is?
-No.

18:25.487 --> 18:27.978
-You staying with April?
-No.

18:28.924 --> 18:32.416
Sister Wilma, take this man and show
him where we're having a problem.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.926
Sandino, I'm gonna work
on a place for you to stay.

18:35.130 --> 18:38.099
-Good seeing you again.
-Thank you. Good to see you too.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.315
Okay!

19:01.323 --> 19:02.347
Bullsh--

19:03.659 --> 19:05.024
Pastor.

19:05.627 --> 19:07.185
Hi, April.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.921
May we come in?

19:15.170 --> 19:18.401
-How are you, April?
-Sleepy. And you?

19:18.607 --> 19:21.041
All the better for seeing you.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.676
What did she do now?

19:22.878 --> 19:25.813
She was caught stealing
from the drugstore.

19:29.618 --> 19:30.846
Maybe she was hungry.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.481
Then why was she
stealing needles?

19:34.656 --> 19:35.782
Oh, I don't know.

19:36.491 --> 19:39.892
Her mother died from drugs, so
maybe she's following in her footsteps.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.723
-April.
-This one right here.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.057
Come on, she's a kid.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.292
-You know where my brothers at?
-Yeah, they out back. Go join them.

19:47.502 --> 19:51.461
-Glad to.
-Get out of here with all that attitude.

19:51.673 --> 19:53.538
-I should've left you outside.
-April.

19:53.742 --> 19:57.405
That's okay. Because when they find
my mama, they're going back to her.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.741
-I ain't got time for these kids.
-Look, April.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.509
-Your mother's getting older.
-Yeah?

20:03.719 --> 20:05.744
Yeah, she can't raise
these kids by herself.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.115
Every time I see her,
she's looking weaker.

20:08.323 --> 20:10.553
These are my sister's kids,
not mine.

20:10.759 --> 20:13.660
Yeah, but your daddy left you
and your sister this house.

20:13.862 --> 20:15.193
-And?
-You haven't done much.

20:15.397 --> 20:17.592
Nope.
I left it just how my daddy left it.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.097
-It's falling apart, April.
-I guess so.

20:20.569 --> 20:23.538
There's a handyman
at the church today. Just listen.

20:23.739 --> 20:25.297
And he needed a place to stay.

20:25.507 --> 20:30.604
So maybe, maybe, in exchange
for his work, you can let him stay here.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.110
That's if he does a good job
at the church.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.010
That's a good idea, pastor, but--

20:35.217 --> 20:36.582
-Time for me to go, huh?
-Yeah.

20:36.785 --> 20:39.117
I gotta work tonight. I'm sleepy.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.518
-You still working at the club, April?
-Six nights a week.

20:43.592 --> 20:46.322
-I'm praying for you, April.
-Thank you, thank you so much.

20:46.528 --> 20:47.517
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

20:47.729 --> 20:50.197
I'm gonna say my prayers for you
before I go to sleep.

20:50.399 --> 20:53.391
-You do that, April.
-Hallelujah.

20:56.638 --> 20:58.606
You know what?

21:02.077 --> 21:04.136
Oh, God.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.644
You don't hear knocking
at this damn door?

21:06.848 --> 21:08.440
This ain't our house.

21:10.319 --> 21:14.278
-What?
-Hi. I'm Sandino Ramirez.

21:14.489 --> 21:16.081
What do you want, man?

21:16.291 --> 21:18.657
I went by the church today.
I spoke to Pastor Brian.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.054
He told me to go see you.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.993
What do you want?

21:22.197 --> 21:24.495
I fixed a few things
at the church today and...

21:25.467 --> 21:28.630
...well, the pastor told me to come
see if you need something--

21:28.837 --> 21:30.270
Anything fixed in your house.

21:30.472 --> 21:33.464
I can work for room and board.
It's fine.

21:34.009 --> 21:34.998
Are you crazy?

21:36.111 --> 21:37.578
No, I'm not crazy. You crazy?

21:38.246 --> 21:40.806
I'm loco. Come on.

21:45.087 --> 21:46.611
Hello.

21:49.324 --> 21:51.724
Let me show you to the basement.

22:00.635 --> 22:01.693
You can sleep down here.

22:01.903 --> 22:05.498
I mean,
I know it's not much, but it's warm.

22:05.707 --> 22:07.368
And there's a cot right there.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.373
Since I don't know you all that well...

22:09.578 --> 22:12.274
...I'm gonna have to lock you
down here in this basement.

22:14.049 --> 22:15.209
Wait a minute.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.818
What if there's a fire
or something like that?

22:19.021 --> 22:22.115
You're a handyman, right?
Break yourself out of here.

22:24.226 --> 22:26.126
Look, do you want it or not?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.460
Okay. And what about food?

22:29.831 --> 22:31.662
Come on.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.027
So you worried about food?

22:33.235 --> 22:37.365
I'm gonna leave a razor so you can
shave that caveman look off.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.465
I'm not the one, you're it!

22:41.176 --> 22:43.337
I got it!

22:55.457 --> 22:57.482
Will y'all shut up down there?

22:59.761 --> 23:01.626
Shut up!

23:05.333 --> 23:06.595
So your name is Byron.

23:07.269 --> 23:09.237
Right? And what is your name?

23:09.438 --> 23:11.372
-I'm Manny.
-Manny.

23:11.573 --> 23:13.234
Okay, Byron and Manny.

23:13.442 --> 23:14.875
May I ask your name?

23:16.711 --> 23:19.271
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.778
Okay.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.416
-Byron doesn't speak, huh?
-No.

23:23.618 --> 23:24.880
That's okay.

23:25.087 --> 23:27.385
So, Byron, Manny,
you guys wanna go out and play?

23:27.589 --> 23:29.079
-No.
-Yeah.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.058
-Why not?
-We don't know you like that.

23:32.260 --> 23:35.423
-Well, your mother's asleep.
-That's not my mom, that's my aunt.

23:35.630 --> 23:37.393
Your mom or your aunt,
she's asleep.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.530
Come on, let's go outside and play.
Throw me the ball.

23:43.472 --> 23:46.771
Yeah, but I'm gonna come too,
so I can keep an eye on you.

23:46.975 --> 23:48.237
Come on.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.812
Slam it again!

23:59.020 --> 24:00.681
I'll teach you how to play football.

24:00.889 --> 24:03.323
Manny, don't run like that.

24:03.892 --> 24:05.018
I'm thinking--

24:05.227 --> 24:06.990
You got some moves, huh?

24:07.195 --> 24:09.459
Get ready for the moves.

24:11.233 --> 24:14.430
-You don't have anything on me, huh?
-Manny, take it easy.

24:14.936 --> 24:16.665
Oh, I got you.

24:16.872 --> 24:17.964
Take it easy.

24:18.173 --> 24:19.731
I wanna be an athlete.

24:19.941 --> 24:20.930
It's gonna be okay.

24:21.143 --> 24:23.270
You okay?

24:23.645 --> 24:24.907
Byron, where's the ball?

24:25.113 --> 24:27.274
-Just behind the flowerpot.
-Okay.

24:27.482 --> 24:28.642
-Manny.
-Go ahead.

24:30.819 --> 24:32.684
Damn. You are fine.

24:33.522 --> 24:34.580
I knew it.

24:36.158 --> 24:38.649
You can't smoke around him.
He's got asthma.

24:39.161 --> 24:41.220
You already said that.

24:46.768 --> 24:49.328
-What's wrong with you, Manny?
-That thing can happen...

24:49.538 --> 24:51.870
...when your mama's on crack
when she's pregnant.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.541
The rate you're going,
you're gonna end up like her.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.473
-You don't know about me.
-I know you're stealing needles.

24:57.679 --> 25:00.011
The needles was for him.
He's got diabetes too.

25:00.215 --> 25:02.945
-What don't you have?
-Cancer.

25:03.685 --> 25:05.710
He's gonna need his insulin
in the morning.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.880
-Well, where is it?
-I dropped it.

25:10.091 --> 25:13.060
Brilliant. So, what happens
if he doesn't take it?

25:13.261 --> 25:14.455
He dies.

25:14.663 --> 25:17.996
I gotta hurry up and find my mama.
Y'all getting on my damn nerves.

25:21.636 --> 25:23.399
I'm home.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.739
What are these kids doing
in this house?

25:28.944 --> 25:32.175
-Hi, baby. Hey.
-Hey. What's going on?

25:32.981 --> 25:35.814
Those are my sister's kids.
You've met them before.

25:36.017 --> 25:38.485
Look, my mother is MlA, okay?

25:38.687 --> 25:41.087
I was about to go there
and find out what's going on.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.018
-I can't be handling all this.
-I know.

25:43.225 --> 25:45.989
Just sit down.
I'm gonna get you something to drink.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.361
And who the hell is this?

25:48.563 --> 25:51.726
-That's Sandino. He's renting a room.
-Renting a room?

25:51.933 --> 25:53.662
You turn this
into a bed and breakfast?

25:53.868 --> 25:56.735
No, the church sent him over
to help me out around here.

25:56.938 --> 25:58.963
Just so he can have
somewhere to stay.

25:59.174 --> 26:00.539
He needs a place to stay.

26:00.742 --> 26:02.710
Everybody needs
a damn place to stay.

26:04.446 --> 26:05.538
What's up, Mexico?

26:07.582 --> 26:09.277
-You legal?
-Stop. Leave him alone.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.453
Hey, he's a grown-ass man.
He can answer the question.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.748
I said, you legal, Mexico, huh?

26:15.957 --> 26:17.356
Look at that. See right there.

26:17.559 --> 26:20.585
I know this boy ain't legal
just by the way he looking down.

26:21.363 --> 26:22.352
Where are you going?

26:23.164 --> 26:25.997
-Take care of my business.
-No, I don't think so.

26:26.201 --> 26:28.761
We're all going somewhere together
in a moment.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.301
You don't tell me what to do.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.235
Hey, little girl, check your tone
in your auntie's house.

26:33.441 --> 26:35.238
-Who are you?
-Watch your mouth.

26:35.443 --> 26:38.139
I'm the one paying the bills up in here.
That's who I am.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.982
Sit down.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.541
Sit down.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.918
You better stop
rolling your eyes at me.

26:49.824 --> 26:52.554
I'll be back. I'm gonna go find my keys.

26:55.830 --> 26:58.958
What? Oh, you need to get by, huh?

27:01.336 --> 27:02.325
All right, then.

27:07.075 --> 27:08.269
Go on, then.

27:15.650 --> 27:16.981
So you think you grown, huh?

27:18.086 --> 27:20.680
I got something for little girls
who think they're grown.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.325
I got something for grown men
who think they got something for me.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.864
Got a fast one on my hands.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.930
I'll show you what I got.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.500
You're too grown to like chocolate?

27:40.008 --> 27:42.499
Come on, go ahead. Come on, baby,
I know you want some.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.003
Go on, take it.

27:47.282 --> 27:49.307
I know you want some, little girl.

27:49.784 --> 27:51.649
I didn't ask you a damn thing,
did l, boy?

27:51.853 --> 27:53.878
-Go sit down, Byron.
-Sit your fat ass down.

27:56.257 --> 27:59.351
-You don't talk to him like that.
-Oh, yes, ma'am.

27:59.561 --> 28:01.358
Miss Jennifer.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.727
-Leave me alone, man.
-I think I'm gonna call you Jenny.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.664
You like that, Jenny?

28:09.237 --> 28:11.137
And what the hell
you looking at, Mexico?

28:12.674 --> 28:14.869
-Speak English?
-Got them. Come on.

28:15.076 --> 28:18.239
-I didn't think so.
-Come on, Let's go. Come on, let's go.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.038
I'll see you later.

28:20.248 --> 28:21.875
Come on.

28:31.693 --> 28:33.888
It's just you and me, Mexico.

28:34.095 --> 28:35.926
Want me to turn on
some mariachi music?

28:36.631 --> 28:39.395
I'm gonna take a nap.
You keep it quiet down here.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.866
You need to take your ass home
and fix something.

28:44.105 --> 28:47.700
Joe, I tell you, you will find that out.
Keep it up. Who's this?

28:47.909 --> 28:49.501
Look who here.

28:49.711 --> 28:52.680
Dumb, dumber, dumberer
and the big dummy.

28:53.882 --> 28:55.975
-Here you are.
-All right.

28:56.184 --> 28:58.345
They eat?
They're gonna need all their strength.

28:58.553 --> 29:00.646
Yeah, they ate.

29:00.855 --> 29:03.016
Jennifer, this is the key
to the house.

29:03.224 --> 29:06.216
When you finish, go back,
and do not let anybody in the house.

29:06.428 --> 29:09.363
-They ain't gonna listen to you.
-Yeah, okay.

29:09.564 --> 29:11.862
-This one has attitude.
-You ain't got to tell me.

29:12.066 --> 29:15.365
-Watch her.
-I wonder where she get that from.

29:15.570 --> 29:17.197
Yes, bye. See you later.

29:17.405 --> 29:19.566
I breaks attitude
with children like this.

29:19.774 --> 29:23.608
You heard of The Horse Whisperer?
I'm the Kid Whisperer.

29:23.812 --> 29:26.542
Look, lady, you gonna tell us
what you need us for, or what?

29:26.748 --> 29:30.275
-Talk to me like that one more time.
-Quiet. This old woman don't play.

29:30.485 --> 29:31.577
She doesn't scare me.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.848
Look at her.

29:34.255 --> 29:38.089
-You better be scared.
-I've been to jail. I will shank you, fool.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.332
You better not touch us again,
or I'll call 91 1.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.125
What do you mean,
"touch you again"?

29:47.335 --> 29:49.200
I ain't touched you yet.

29:49.404 --> 29:51.770
You gotta get to the phone
if you're gonna dial 911.

29:51.973 --> 29:53.235
You got to get to the phone.

29:53.441 --> 29:56.467
I will hit you so hard that
your cranium and your urethra tube...

29:56.678 --> 29:59.078
...will all be tied up together
inside of each other.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.578
You wouldn't be able to do nothing
but pee and run.

30:05.653 --> 30:07.644
You don't know if I got a cell phone.

30:07.856 --> 30:10.848
You're gonna need surgery
to get it from down your throat.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.249
-Whatever.
-Say something again.

30:13.461 --> 30:17.420
Say one more thing,
I will pimp-slap you. Say it again.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.767
That's what I thought.

30:20.969 --> 30:23.028
You're gonna come
into this house and clean.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.002
And if anything come up missing
in my house, I promise you...

30:26.207 --> 30:30.667
...you're gonna come up missing.

30:34.616 --> 30:36.413
Come on.
We cleaning from top to bottom.

30:36.618 --> 30:38.984
-Let's get in here.
-This is crazy.

30:39.187 --> 30:40.381
What you say?

30:40.588 --> 30:42.385
Yeah, this is one
of my favorite nights.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.387
Yeah, go, April, go.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.390
I need two Heinekens
and a shot of vodka.

30:47.996 --> 30:49.691
Here. Last night, you were short.

30:49.898 --> 30:53.026
Don't be short tonight,
else you're gonna come up missing.

30:55.003 --> 30:56.868
Come in.

31:02.343 --> 31:05.540
-Hey, April.
-Hey, Miss Wilma.

31:05.747 --> 31:07.510
What are you doing here?

31:07.715 --> 31:09.410
I was just wondering...

31:09.617 --> 31:12.017
...have you talked
to your mother lately?

31:12.720 --> 31:15.917
Yeah, I went by the house earlier,
she wasn't there.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.092
I don't know.
I don't know where she is.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.557
You know, this is just--
It's not like her.

31:20.762 --> 31:22.753
No, it isn't. I don't know what to say.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.592
I was gonna come by there later on.
Will you let me in?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.233
No, I can't do that, child.

31:27.435 --> 31:31.929
I let your sister in there one time.
She stole everything your mama had.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.405
You should've known better than to let
a crackhead in somebody's house.

31:35.610 --> 31:37.441
Well, I can't let you go in there.

31:38.846 --> 31:42.873
Your mama
had such high hopes for you.

31:43.084 --> 31:45.052
Miss Wilma,
is there anything else you need?

31:45.253 --> 31:47.881
Because I really have
to get ready for my next set.

31:48.089 --> 31:49.920
No, that's it.

31:50.124 --> 31:51.455
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.059
-Thank you.
-God bless you.

31:54.262 --> 31:55.786
Alrighty.

32:01.135 --> 32:03.365
You're doing a good job cleaning,
Manny and Byron.

32:03.571 --> 32:07.701
I don't know why you letting them
children clean up anything up in here.

32:07.909 --> 32:11.936
You're gonna need a metal detectors
when they leave up out of here.

32:12.146 --> 32:14.137
All right.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.647
-How the dishes coming?
-Fine.

32:18.386 --> 32:21.287
Little girl, you got the nastiest attitude
I ever did see.

32:23.257 --> 32:25.748
-Why are you so nasty?
-Because.

32:29.130 --> 32:30.927
I'm about to come over there.

32:31.132 --> 32:33.896
Joe, you better get this girl.
She just said "because" to me.

32:35.336 --> 32:39.670
You better watch it, girl. That's the
heavyweight champion of the world.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.399
She took out Ali and Frazier
and George Foreman.

32:42.610 --> 32:45.511
They all came here
and she took them out.

32:45.713 --> 32:48.443
-That's why Foreman's selling grills.
-Attitude like that...

32:48.650 --> 32:51.778
...gonna be by yourself all your life.
Nobody wanna be around that.

32:53.588 --> 32:55.351
Maybe I don't want nobody around.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.353
Yeah, Madea want flies around here.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.584
Every time she goes somewhere,
flies be flying around her.

33:00.795 --> 33:03.457
Just funky. Maybe that
backwards boy washing the soap.

33:03.665 --> 33:06.634
You get out of this life what you put in.
You give good things...

33:06.834 --> 33:09.029
...good things will come back
most of the time.

33:09.837 --> 33:10.826
That ain't true.

33:11.039 --> 33:14.440
-I said most of the time, child.
-Yeah, whatever.

33:14.642 --> 33:17.770
Girl, if you say "whatever" to me
one more time...

33:18.346 --> 33:20.507
...before the "wha"
can get out of your mouth...

33:20.715 --> 33:24.014
...I'm gonna be in the back
of a police car. Sit down.

33:24.218 --> 33:26.550
Sit down.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.158
Know what happens to girls
that are mad at the world?

33:33.361 --> 33:36.728
They become bitter old women
if they don't figure out what's going on.

33:36.931 --> 33:41.368
Bitter old woman, just like the one
you're talking to, a bitter old woman.

33:41.569 --> 33:44.629
A bitter 450-pound old woman.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.901
Oh, that's funny?

33:48.109 --> 33:51.476
At least you could smile. Did that hurt?
Did it crack your face, Cruella?

33:51.679 --> 33:54.648
-I ain't got a whole lot to smile about.
-Hush that up.

33:54.849 --> 33:57.283
Got a whole lot to smile about,
you living.

33:57.485 --> 33:59.510
They got children your age
in the hospital...

33:59.721 --> 34:02.554
...strung out on HlV, drugs
and everything else.

34:03.191 --> 34:06.024
You talking about you ain't got
nothing to smile-- You pretty.

34:06.227 --> 34:09.856
Get you a mirror and see how pretty
you are and smile at yourself.

34:10.398 --> 34:14.732
I'm not pretty. I mean,
I ain't got nice clothes or nothing.

34:14.936 --> 34:17.563
Clothes don't make you pretty.
They make you broke.

34:19.574 --> 34:21.007
You know what I want you to do?

34:21.208 --> 34:22.699
There ain't no mirror down here.

34:22.909 --> 34:24.878
When you get through
cleaning that window...

34:25.079 --> 34:27.172
...Iook at yourself
and see how pretty you are.

34:27.380 --> 34:31.181
Go on and clean it real good
until you see your smile:

34:32.120 --> 34:33.781
We wanna give it up
for the Gap Band.

34:33.987 --> 34:36.286
Give it up for the Gap Band,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.014
That's not the original Gap Band.

34:38.226 --> 34:40.284
They just get
their clothes from the Gap...

34:40.495 --> 34:41.928
...so we call them the Gap Band.

34:42.130 --> 34:44.393
They sound good.
Don't they sound good tonight?

34:44.599 --> 34:45.964
Look. She look good tonight.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.156
Gotta have a fix.

34:47.368 --> 34:49.996
Oh, my Lord. The church.

34:50.204 --> 34:52.364
We got a lady here from the church.

34:52.572 --> 34:57.169
And I'm telling you, this lady can sing.
She can really sing.

34:57.378 --> 35:00.836
Ladies and gentlemen, now, the spirits
say that if we make a lot of noise...

35:01.048 --> 35:06.418
...she just may come up here and sing
a song for us poor little sinners.

35:06.621 --> 35:09.590
-Come on up here, Miss Wilma.
-No, don't do that.

35:09.791 --> 35:13.557
Oh, Miss Wilma don't mind.
Come on up here, Miss Wilma.

35:13.761 --> 35:16.161
How are you doing tonight?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.764
-I'm doing fine, Freddie.
-Good seeing you.

35:18.966 --> 35:20.831
-You look lovely.
-Thank you very much.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.196
You gonna sing
something for us tonight?

35:23.404 --> 35:26.430
Well, I'm always ready to give
my testimony anytime, any--

35:26.641 --> 35:28.734
Now, Miss Wilma,
I don't mind you singing...

35:28.943 --> 35:31.571
...but save all that testimony stuff
for the church.

35:31.779 --> 35:34.247
Right now,
we just want you to sing a little song...

35:34.448 --> 35:36.143
...make the people feel good.

35:36.350 --> 35:39.080
What do you already know?
You know what she's gonna sing.

35:39.287 --> 35:41.482
Hold this, Freddie.
Don't steal nothing.

35:41.689 --> 35:44.681
Miss Wilma. Let's do it.

35:44.892 --> 35:47.383
I'd like to dedicate this
to all you beautiful faces...

35:47.595 --> 35:51.759
...but especially to April.

39:01.856 --> 39:03.619
Thank you.

39:06.193 --> 39:09.424
Y'all go straight in the house,
you understand?

39:11.832 --> 39:14.266
Boy, don't be slamming my door.

39:15.069 --> 39:16.866
Hey, wait.

39:22.309 --> 39:23.833
Thank you. Hey, how was it?

39:24.045 --> 39:28.209
I don't wanna steal nothing else
if that's what I gotta do to pay it back.

39:28.416 --> 39:29.713
That lady's crazy.

39:32.553 --> 39:36.148
That means all of your decisions,
your choices...

39:36.357 --> 39:37.790
...they all have a price to pay.

39:37.992 --> 39:40.756
So you do the crime,
you gotta do the time.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.451
Yeah, whatever.

39:42.663 --> 39:44.961
Look, we ought to take a bath.
Go on upstairs.

39:45.166 --> 39:46.861
Jennifer.

39:48.035 --> 39:49.525
What's this?

39:52.573 --> 39:54.040
You bought his insulin.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.774
I was gonna do it.

39:58.379 --> 40:00.370
Well, now you don't have to.

40:03.684 --> 40:05.709
Why are you so nice to us?

40:05.920 --> 40:08.889
-I don't understand that question.
-You nice, why?

40:09.090 --> 40:10.580
Why not?

40:10.791 --> 40:13.089
You should expect people
to be nice to you.

40:13.294 --> 40:15.125
You shouldn't expect people
to be mean.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.591
Not in this world.

40:16.797 --> 40:19.789
-You get what you expect, right?
-I guess.

40:22.736 --> 40:24.465
You do a great job
with your brothers.

40:26.474 --> 40:28.567
I'm all they got.

40:51.799 --> 40:54.165
Oh, come on.
What the hell is Mexico up to?

40:54.368 --> 40:55.665
Are you serious?

41:01.175 --> 41:02.164
Hey.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.276
What--?
Do you know what time it is?

41:05.279 --> 41:08.908
-Yeah, it's 1 :30 in the afternoon.
-What are you doing?

41:09.116 --> 41:11.277
-I'm working off my debt.
-What?

41:12.086 --> 41:14.646
I figured that I'd get up this morning,
get to work.

41:14.855 --> 41:17.881
Figured if I fixed this floor,
then the kids can stay in this room.

41:18.092 --> 41:19.923
You don't have to worry
about those kids.

41:20.127 --> 41:23.824
They're not staying, pack up your tools
and go back down in the basement.

41:24.498 --> 41:26.159
Why not?
Why they don't stay in here?

41:27.067 --> 41:30.230
What do you mean--?
Hey, hey, hey!

41:30.437 --> 41:32.962
Hey!

41:33.174 --> 41:35.438
Stop it! Stop it!

41:36.043 --> 41:39.137
Look, you have a serious problem
with this floor, okay?

41:39.346 --> 41:40.335
I know that.

41:40.548 --> 41:42.448
That's why no one
ever comes up here...

41:42.650 --> 41:46.142
...and that's why I keep
the door closed. For safety, okay?

41:46.353 --> 41:48.617
These kids,
they need a room of their own.

41:48.822 --> 41:51.882
Why are you so worried about kids
that don't even belong to you?

41:52.092 --> 41:53.525
-What's up?
-That's your family.

41:53.727 --> 41:54.887
Why you not concerned?

41:55.429 --> 41:58.193
Jennifer has nightmares every night.
Manny, night sweats.

41:58.399 --> 42:01.459
Byron, he tosses and turns
in his sleep.

42:01.669 --> 42:03.899
Can you imagine
what those kids have been through?

42:04.104 --> 42:05.696
I just wanna help them.

42:06.540 --> 42:08.701
You wanna help them?

42:08.909 --> 42:11.377
You live in my basement.
You can't even help yourself.

42:11.579 --> 42:12.637
How are you gonna help?

42:12.846 --> 42:16.213
-By giving them this room.
-No, no, you're not.

42:16.417 --> 42:17.611
This is my house.

42:19.887 --> 42:22.822
You can't give them nothing
that doesn't belong to you.

42:23.023 --> 42:26.220
If you're so worried about the kids,
why are you making so much noise?

42:26.427 --> 42:29.260
-You're waking them up.
-They were gone before I got up.

42:29.463 --> 42:32.159
Well, where did they go?
Since you know so much about them.

42:32.366 --> 42:33.355
I don't know.

42:33.567 --> 42:36.661
What do you care? You don't even
make them comfortable to stay here.

42:36.870 --> 42:39.566
That's right, three less things
I gotta worry about.

42:39.773 --> 42:43.231
Pack up your little tools and follow me
back down to the basement, come on.

42:43.444 --> 42:44.911
-You know, you don't--
-Let's go.

42:45.112 --> 42:46.272
You don't even mean that.

42:46.747 --> 42:48.112
You don't know me.

42:48.315 --> 42:50.215
-Let's go, back to your blind spot.
-Hey.

42:50.417 --> 42:52.442
These kids need someone.
They need some help.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.712
Okay, well,
when my mama comes back...

42:54.922 --> 42:58.517
...she will come and get them,
and they will have someone, happy?

42:59.426 --> 43:01.894
You're not this heartless, April.

43:02.096 --> 43:03.688
So why do you do this?

43:03.897 --> 43:05.922
Is it because of your man?

43:06.133 --> 43:07.862
Is it because of him?

43:09.703 --> 43:11.261
You know, you're too good for him.

43:13.407 --> 43:15.932
Please, Sandino, stop it.

43:18.312 --> 43:21.873
Okay, I'll finish up
after your man wakes up.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.976
Thank you.

43:32.293 --> 43:35.126
I'm coming. Shoot.

43:46.940 --> 43:48.168
Pastor.

43:49.109 --> 43:52.306
Miss Wilma.
What are you guys doing here?

43:52.513 --> 43:54.913
-Hi, April.
-Hi.

43:55.115 --> 43:56.412
Can we come in?

44:00.521 --> 44:03.854
-Hello.
-Hey, you clean up nice.

44:04.458 --> 44:05.447
Thank you.

44:05.659 --> 44:09.356
-Getting any work done around here?
-Yeah, as much as she'll let me.

44:09.563 --> 44:12.396
Great job in the chapel.
We even have a check for you.

44:12.599 --> 44:15.534
Well, that's great.
I'll come by to pick it up.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.363
Hello?

44:17.705 --> 44:20.640
Is that what you came by for?
Because I can go back to bed.

44:20.841 --> 44:22.706
April, can we sit down?

44:22.910 --> 44:24.878
Yeah, sure.

44:44.131 --> 44:45.496
What is it?

44:46.600 --> 44:49.160
It's about your mother.

44:49.670 --> 44:52.833
-You found her. Where is she?
-I'm sorry, April.

44:53.607 --> 44:54.835
She died.

44:56.310 --> 44:57.800
What?

44:59.913 --> 45:01.847
What?

45:02.816 --> 45:04.044
I'm sorry, baby.

45:04.251 --> 45:07.414
-When?
-About a week ago.

45:14.228 --> 45:17.686
-What happened?
-She left for work.

45:18.098 --> 45:19.497
I saw her.

45:19.700 --> 45:24.433
And she had a brain aneurysm.

45:24.638 --> 45:26.572
A brain aneurysm.

45:26.774 --> 45:30.403
She was on the bus all day...

45:30.611 --> 45:33.808
...and no one noticed.

45:34.014 --> 45:35.242
She....

45:35.449 --> 45:38.213
They assumed she was just asleep.

45:39.086 --> 45:43.785
And when the driver tried to wake her,
it was too late.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.884
There was nothing anyone could do.

45:47.094 --> 45:48.891
I'm sorry.

45:50.364 --> 45:52.889
She was at the city morgue.

45:53.100 --> 45:55.034
No one claimed her.

45:55.636 --> 45:57.968
No identification.

46:01.809 --> 46:04.403
She was dead too long...

46:05.345 --> 46:07.472
...so they cremated her.

46:08.081 --> 46:09.480
Oh, my God.

46:10.584 --> 46:12.916
These are her remains.

46:16.757 --> 46:18.224
I....

46:18.525 --> 46:21.187
I put them in this urn.

46:23.464 --> 46:27.025
I'm gonna go
and pack up her things...

46:28.168 --> 46:31.137
...and you're welcome to come by
and get them.

46:32.105 --> 46:34.096
I'm sorry, April.

46:41.014 --> 46:46.281
If you need anything, April,
just come by the church.

46:47.955 --> 46:49.183
You take care of her, huh?

46:49.723 --> 46:51.623
Yes, of course.

46:52.392 --> 46:54.860
April, what were you praying for?

47:23.323 --> 47:25.086
What are you doing, man?

47:25.292 --> 47:27.123
I'm sleeping.

47:47.548 --> 47:49.072
You want some company?

47:52.719 --> 47:55.244
That ain't no way
for somebody to die.

47:57.190 --> 47:59.317
I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

48:22.649 --> 48:25.379
When was the last time
that you spoke to her?

48:26.620 --> 48:28.588
A year ago.

48:32.292 --> 48:33.725
We....

48:34.194 --> 48:38.096
We had an argument.
It's so stupid now.

48:42.469 --> 48:44.198
My sister...

48:45.339 --> 48:47.534
...was so strung out.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.735
She screwed those kids up.

48:52.279 --> 48:53.837
She--

48:54.348 --> 48:59.945
She traded Jennifer for crack one time
when she was 9.

49:05.092 --> 49:08.994
She was so high one time,
she put Byron in the oven.

49:09.196 --> 49:12.529
She burned Manny
with her crack pipe.

49:14.134 --> 49:17.433
And my mother was there
every time.

49:17.638 --> 49:18.627
Every time.

49:22.042 --> 49:25.273
She'd asked me to babysit...

49:26.113 --> 49:28.172
...and I told her I couldn't.

49:29.449 --> 49:33.283
And I wasn't doing nothing.
I just didn't feel like being bothered.

49:36.723 --> 49:40.386
So she got mad at me
and I never spoke to her again.

49:45.732 --> 49:49.259
I said some things
I really wish I could take back.

49:57.210 --> 50:02.512
All the good she did for people
and she died on a bus.

50:04.017 --> 50:08.545
Oh, she was good to everybody.
She died on a bus alone.

50:15.796 --> 50:18.890
Watch out, y'all, stay close together.
I'm coming.

50:22.335 --> 50:24.326
Where have you been?

50:25.105 --> 50:27.403
Looking for Mama Rose.

50:31.645 --> 50:34.045
I have something to tell you.

50:34.614 --> 50:36.138
What is it?

50:40.220 --> 50:42.279
My mother died.

50:43.090 --> 50:44.489
What?

50:45.859 --> 50:47.383
Why are you lying?

50:48.895 --> 50:49.884
She's not lying.

50:50.097 --> 50:52.190
You will say anything
to get rid of us, huh?

50:52.399 --> 50:54.731
-Jennifer.
-lf you don't want us here, we'll go.

50:54.935 --> 50:56.368
You don't have to say all that.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.231
-It's not true.
-You will say anything.

51:00.440 --> 51:03.238
-lt is true, Manny.
-Can I go feed them?

51:04.578 --> 51:09.208
-Yeah.
-Jennifer. Jennifer.

51:10.550 --> 51:11.539
Are you okay?

51:12.285 --> 51:14.310
Yeah, I'm fine. People die. So what?

51:14.521 --> 51:17.046
Hey, listen,
it's okay to cry or to be upset.

51:17.257 --> 51:19.020
I said I'm fine, okay?

51:36.409 --> 51:39.207
Yo, turn the damn TV down, please.

51:40.680 --> 51:42.170
Hey, Agnes, how you doing?

51:42.382 --> 51:44.816
-Good to see you.
-Hi, Madea.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.415
What you doing sitting out here?

51:49.356 --> 51:50.823
Trying to steal something?

51:56.096 --> 51:57.859
What's going on with you?

51:59.599 --> 52:00.964
My grandmother died.

52:01.168 --> 52:03.136
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, babe.

52:03.336 --> 52:06.863
My Aunt April's gonna send us
back to foster care.

52:07.374 --> 52:08.932
They're going to separate us.

52:10.811 --> 52:12.244
I'm all Manny and Byron got.

52:12.445 --> 52:16.245
If we separate, I don't know--
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

52:16.716 --> 52:19.617
-Oh, no.
-Calm yourself down, honey.

52:19.820 --> 52:22.914
-Calm down. Getting all worked up.
-Can we stay with you?

52:27.828 --> 52:29.659
Nobody wants us.

52:29.863 --> 52:35.130
-That ain't true. Somebody wants you.
-I'm only 1 6. I'm....

52:36.269 --> 52:39.670
-I don't know how to handle all this.
-Honey.

52:39.873 --> 52:42.501
-I'm tired. I don't--
-Living takes a lifetime.

52:42.709 --> 52:45.542
You got a whole lot more living
to do, honey.

52:45.745 --> 52:49.112
I don't feel like I'm gonna--
I don't feel like I'm gonna make it.

52:49.316 --> 52:50.840
You gonna make it. Hush, dear.

52:51.051 --> 52:53.451
Gotta keep getting up every day,
one day at a time.

52:53.653 --> 52:54.711
You're gonna make it.

52:54.921 --> 53:00.655
My Grandma Rose used to tell us
to pray about it, and if....

53:01.361 --> 53:05.388
Then that's what you ought to do,
pray about it, talk to the Lord about it.

53:05.599 --> 53:10.696
Yeah, but she only told us--
She never told me how to do it.

53:12.839 --> 53:14.136
Would you teach me?

53:15.976 --> 53:17.204
Please.

53:17.844 --> 53:20.574
-Show you how to pray?
-Yeah.

53:22.282 --> 53:23.874
Oh, child, I ain't talked to God...

53:24.084 --> 53:27.747
...since the last time I saw a cop
in my rearview mirror.

53:29.389 --> 53:31.323
I guess I can try.

53:31.524 --> 53:33.856
I can try to pray.
You know the number?

53:34.060 --> 53:35.049
The what?

53:35.262 --> 53:36.593
-The number.
-The number?

53:36.796 --> 53:38.354
To call him.

53:38.565 --> 53:41.261
They say "Jesus On the Mainline."
I don't know the number.

53:41.468 --> 53:42.992
Sit back, sit back.

53:43.203 --> 53:45.865
Okay, bow your head.

53:46.172 --> 53:50.108
First, giving honor to God,
to the head of my life.

53:53.280 --> 53:57.842
Father

53:58.051 --> 54:01.145
I stretch

54:01.621 --> 54:08.083
My hand

54:10.196 --> 54:11.288
To thee

54:12.232 --> 54:14.223
Father God...

54:14.768 --> 54:19.865
...God of Abraham, lsaac and Jacob.

54:20.540 --> 54:24.271
God of Shadrach,
Meshach and the billy goat...

54:24.477 --> 54:26.945
...who was in the fiery furnace
that they barbecued...

54:27.147 --> 54:29.911
...on the day of Pentecost
when the Jewish people returned...

54:30.116 --> 54:34.485
...from the Sabbath day
up on the mountaintop in Ethiopia.

54:34.688 --> 54:38.681
God of Mary J. Blige.

54:38.892 --> 54:41.827
Madea, that don't sound right.

54:42.662 --> 54:45.654
That don't sound right. That's not
how Mama Rose used to do it.

54:45.865 --> 54:48.333
You ain't feeling it?
You didn't feel the anointing?

54:48.835 --> 54:51.030
-No.
-I don't know nothing about praying.

54:51.237 --> 54:54.434
But all praying is, is talking to God,
having a conversation with him.

54:54.641 --> 54:56.609
And at the end,
you say the name of Jesus.

54:56.810 --> 54:59.677
That's your stamp that will get it
up there to him. You hear?

55:00.680 --> 55:02.443
Okay.

55:02.849 --> 55:04.680
You know who you remind me of
right now?

55:04.884 --> 55:08.012
You remind me of Peter in the Bible.
You know who Peter was?

55:09.823 --> 55:11.757
Peter was one of the 1 2 disciplines.

55:11.958 --> 55:14.722
And they were on a boat
out on the isle...

55:14.928 --> 55:17.419
...of the Greek Atlantic Ocean.

55:17.630 --> 55:21.327
And when they was on this boat,
the storm rose up.

55:21.534 --> 55:24.560
And the 1 2 disciplines, they got really,
really worried and upset.

55:24.771 --> 55:26.636
They said,
"Oh, no, what are we gonna do?"

55:26.840 --> 55:29.138
They saw someone coming
toward them on the water...

55:29.342 --> 55:32.243
...Iooked like a ghost.
But it wasn't a ghost. It was Jesus.

55:32.445 --> 55:35.380
And Peter say, "Jesus, if that's you,
let me come out there."

55:35.582 --> 55:37.675
You gotta be careful
what you ask the Lord for.

55:37.884 --> 55:39.545
So Jesus said, "Come on out."

55:39.753 --> 55:42.813
So Peter stepped out of the boat
and was walking on the water.

55:43.556 --> 55:45.547
He was walking on water?

55:45.759 --> 55:48.922
On the water. He was walking
on the water toward Jesus.

55:49.129 --> 55:51.996
Long as he kept his eyes on him,
he stayed on top of the water.

55:52.198 --> 55:55.497
He took his eyes off him, though.
You know why? He got distracted.

55:55.702 --> 55:57.135
You know why he got distracted?

55:57.337 --> 56:00.306
When you got your eye on Jesus,
can't get distracted by nothing.

56:00.507 --> 56:02.372
Jonah passed by
in the belly of the whale.

56:02.575 --> 56:05.271
He looked down, Free Willy
with Jonah inside the belly...

56:05.478 --> 56:07.878
...and it made him distracted,
so he started to sink.

56:08.081 --> 56:10.572
He said, "Jesus, Jesus, help me."
Jesus said, "l can't.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.217
I gotta go to Calvary. I'm late."

56:12.419 --> 56:15.445
Jesus went to the cross. He said,
"I'm gonna send you a comforter.

56:15.655 --> 56:17.885
When the comforter come,
you gonna be all right."

56:18.091 --> 56:19.718
So he's swimming.
He try and swim.

56:19.926 --> 56:21.894
He's worried, Jaws was coming,
all that--

56:22.095 --> 56:23.687
Spielberg had did that Jaws thing.

56:23.897 --> 56:25.626
It was surrounding him.
He was worried.

56:25.832 --> 56:27.663
-You know what happened?
-What?

56:27.867 --> 56:29.027
Just in the nick of time--

56:29.235 --> 56:31.066
When you think
you ain't gonna make it...

56:31.271 --> 56:33.136
...in the nick of time,
something happens.

56:33.339 --> 56:34.829
Noah came up in the arch.

56:35.742 --> 56:39.234
That's right, Noah came rowing up
in the arch of St. Louis Arch...

56:39.446 --> 56:41.437
...and he pulled right up beside him.

56:41.648 --> 56:44.276
He got on there, he said,
"Thank you for saving me."

56:44.484 --> 56:46.884
Noah said, "No problem, man.
Cool, what's up, fool?"

56:47.087 --> 56:49.146
He said, "Come on,
let me show you around."

56:49.355 --> 56:51.346
Noah had turned the arch
into a cruise ship.

56:51.558 --> 56:53.890
Ain't have nothing to do
after he saved the world.

56:54.094 --> 56:55.527
Hey, you know who was on there?

56:55.728 --> 56:58.561
-Eve.
-Eve?

56:59.065 --> 57:01.659
She was in the VlP section.
Yeah, that's right.

57:01.868 --> 57:04.462
And Peter asked, he said,
"Eve, come on, go to the show."

57:04.671 --> 57:07.299
So she went to see this show.
And they had tigers.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.372
They had two tigers,
two bears, two lions.

57:09.576 --> 57:11.134
You know, the male and the female.

57:11.344 --> 57:14.177
Well, Siegfried and Roy was there,
and they had the two lions.

57:14.380 --> 57:17.349
And them lions jumped out
and scratched Eve.

57:17.550 --> 57:19.643
That's how Eve get them
two paws right there.

57:19.853 --> 57:23.016
You ever see Eve with the paws?
She got two paws right there.

57:23.223 --> 57:26.192
Read your Bible some time, honey.
Read your Bible.

57:30.296 --> 57:33.390
This is a mess, April.
I mean, you don't care?

57:33.600 --> 57:37.331
I don't know. I mean, Tanya...

57:38.004 --> 57:40.939
...you know I can't help them kids.

57:41.641 --> 57:45.338
I mean, I didn't ask for none of this.

57:45.545 --> 57:48.514
I ain't never seen
a more selfish person in my life.

57:50.717 --> 57:54.278
Okay, what do you
mean by that, Tanya?

57:54.754 --> 57:59.487
I mean, April, you gotta care
about somebody other than yourself.

58:00.226 --> 58:01.853
You don't know me, man.

58:02.061 --> 58:03.494
-Oh, I know you.
-No, you don't.

58:03.696 --> 58:05.755
-That's the problem.
-Tanya, look, l--

58:05.965 --> 58:09.696
Look, I didn't come here
for that, okay?

58:09.903 --> 58:13.031
Honey, I love you,
so I can say this, okay?

58:13.239 --> 58:15.969
Girl, you always drunk. Always.

58:16.176 --> 58:18.974
There's not a day
that I have not seen you drunk.

58:19.612 --> 58:22.513
You just care about alcohol
and "Where's Randy?"

58:22.715 --> 58:24.478
I mean, I'm sick of hearing that.

58:24.684 --> 58:27.118
You got a bigger problem
on your hands right now.

58:27.320 --> 58:29.481
If I wasn't your friend,
if I didn't love you...

58:29.689 --> 58:33.181
...I wouldn't bring it to you real
just like I'm giving it to you right now.

58:33.393 --> 58:35.258
You don't care about nobody
but yourself.

58:35.461 --> 58:38.089
I mean, you sleeping
with a married man.

58:38.298 --> 58:41.062
You know why? Because you don't
want him around all the time.

58:41.267 --> 58:43.827
You got that big old house,
and you only want you in it.

58:44.037 --> 58:46.267
You won't even give a bum
on the street 50 cents.

58:46.472 --> 58:49.839
I mean, you don't sound shallow,
you just sound damn selfish.

58:51.477 --> 58:55.880
Oh, so I'm just a bad person, huh?
I'm just evil.

58:56.082 --> 58:58.915
You know what?
Ain't nothing wrong with what you do.

58:59.118 --> 59:02.349
But as long as it works for you,
that's all good, right?

59:02.555 --> 59:05.183
You need to get
your life together fast.

59:05.391 --> 59:08.519
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Miss Tanya.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.229
Tanya.

59:17.403 --> 59:19.268
Bravo.

59:24.744 --> 59:26.405
Do it.

01:02:22.755 --> 01:02:24.484
What's wrong with him?

01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:29.120
His blood sugar went up,
so I gave him his insulin shot.

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:32.593
Don't worry about it, I got it.
He'll be fine.

01:02:46.913 --> 01:02:49.143
I can't keep y'all.

01:02:51.317 --> 01:02:52.614
You don't owe us nothing.

01:02:57.123 --> 01:03:00.422
I think we can find you
a great foster home.

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.787
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be just like you.

01:03:04.797 --> 01:03:08.324
Ain't gonna give a damn
about nobody but myself.

01:03:08.968 --> 01:03:10.936
That's the only way to be.

01:03:11.671 --> 01:03:13.366
What the hell do I look like...

01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:20.279
