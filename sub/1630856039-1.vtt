01:44.102 --> 01:45.631
In the beginning,

01:45.631 --> 01:49.668
everything feels so alive and...

01:49.668 --> 01:51.406
exciting.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.414
But time makes it predictable.

02:03.187 --> 02:05.585
He doesn’t really
see me anymore.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.657
It’s as if he’s replaced me
with someone else.

02:15.331 --> 02:19.302
I’ve lost those parts
of who I am...

02:19.302 --> 02:21.238
or who I could be.

02:23.537 --> 02:27.442
And... I’m scared
I won’t ever get them back.

02:30.148 --> 02:32.216
Maybe I shouldn’t
be telling you this.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.752
Another 500,000
people have been displaced

02:40.752 --> 02:42.457
by the vast tornado systems

02:42.457 --> 02:45.130
wreaking havoc
on Central and Western Europe.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.330
European leaders
have described the storms

02:47.330 --> 02:49.233
as catastrophic
in scale and power...

02:49.233 --> 02:51.598
The warning period
for severe heat and drought

02:51.598 --> 02:55.338
has been extended again
to nearly 60 million Americans

02:55.338 --> 02:58.176
under the Federal Government’s
Climate Alert System.

03:05.414 --> 03:07.416
...or underlying
health conditions

03:07.416 --> 03:09.418
are reminded
to take extra precautions

03:09.418 --> 03:12.157
and remain indoors
when possible.

04:46.812 --> 04:48.484
Hen?

04:50.651 --> 04:52.290
Hen!

04:53.720 --> 04:55.557
You expecting anyone?

05:03.598 --> 05:05.798
What? What is it?

05:05.798 --> 05:07.569
Didn’t hear you come in.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.773
Someone’s here.
- Oh.

05:13.773 --> 05:15.775
Looks official, doesn’t it?

05:15.775 --> 05:17.843
Yeah, could be.

05:17.843 --> 05:20.516
When was the last time
we had a visitor?

05:24.817 --> 05:26.654
He must be lost.

05:26.654 --> 05:28.656
No, I don’t think so.

05:31.395 --> 05:34.563
He must want something.

05:34.563 --> 05:36.697
- W... Oh, my God.

05:36.697 --> 05:37.863
Hey, whoa...

05:37.863 --> 05:39.634
- Um...
- You been messing with this?

05:39.634 --> 05:41.768
What are you talking about?
- It’s empty, Hen.

05:41.768 --> 05:43.440
Yeah. We never leave it loaded.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.277
What do you mean,
we never leave it loaded?

05:45.277 --> 05:46.806
Just put the gun back!
Put it back.

05:46.806 --> 05:48.478
- Or what?

05:48.478 --> 05:50.909
Just put the gun back, OK?
We need to go. Come on.

05:52.581 --> 05:55.716
I can’t do anything
with the gun. It’s empty.

05:56.651 --> 05:58.653
Go.

06:05.792 --> 06:07.563
Hello?

06:07.563 --> 06:11.336
I’m sorry.
I know it’s late.

06:11.336 --> 06:12.832
Is that Henrietta?

06:15.472 --> 06:18.442
Who’s that?
Terrance.

06:18.442 --> 06:21.038
Yeah, we don’t know
any Terrance.

06:21.038 --> 06:24.415
Junior?

06:24.415 --> 06:26.681
I think you’ll want to hear
what I have to say.

06:26.681 --> 06:27.946
Both of you.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.420
No.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.922
What’s this about?

06:36.922 --> 06:39.023
I’m here
on behalf of OuterMore.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.662
OuterMore?

06:40.662 --> 06:43.566
We’re working on
the climate migration strategy.

06:43.566 --> 06:46.503
Specifically,
Off-Earth habitation.

06:46.503 --> 06:48.065
What is he saying?

06:48.065 --> 06:49.869
I think he means
living in space.

06:51.805 --> 06:53.576
You OK if I came in?

06:56.678 --> 06:58.009
Yeah.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.456
Anybody else
in the car?

07:05.456 --> 07:07.953
No,
making these visits is my job.

07:07.953 --> 07:09.361
Hi.

07:21.131 --> 07:24.134
Do you want to sit down?
Sure.

07:24.134 --> 07:25.839
OK.

07:25.839 --> 07:27.478
Mm-hm.

07:33.814 --> 07:35.981
It’s a great place.
Hm.

07:37.015 --> 07:39.490
Charming.

07:39.490 --> 07:40.821
Rustic.

07:41.888 --> 07:43.725
How old is it?

07:43.725 --> 07:47.498
Ah, it’s old.
Couple of hundred years.

07:47.498 --> 07:49.962
Wow.

07:49.962 --> 07:53.702
You just... you just
don’t see this anymore.

07:53.702 --> 07:55.572
Guessing it’s always
been in the family?

07:55.572 --> 07:57.937
Yeah. Yeah, fifth generation.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.840
Oh, I love that.

08:00.973 --> 08:02.843
The old ways of living.

08:02.843 --> 08:05.076
Yep,
still a few of us left, so...

08:06.418 --> 08:08.882
But you don’t farm it, do you?

08:08.882 --> 08:11.115
Right, well, this is...
this is very exciting,

08:11.115 --> 08:13.623
but before I say anything,

08:13.623 --> 08:15.625
I’m supposed to show you this.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.463
Now, I’m sure you’ve seen
our previous campaigns,

08:18.463 --> 08:20.124
but this one is special.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.159
- Can you see OK?

08:22.159 --> 08:23.864
Yep. Can you see?

08:24.931 --> 08:26.130
Uh-huh.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.967
We are all
so proud of you.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.540
It is so inspiring.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.476
You’re giving us hope
for the planet.

08:31.476 --> 08:33.511
I got chosen.
I’m going to space.

08:33.511 --> 08:35.678
We’re all
eternally grateful.

08:35.678 --> 08:37.581
I can’t wait to see
your smiling face soon.

08:37.581 --> 08:39.715
We’ve been working on
the next phase of transition

08:39.715 --> 08:41.112
for a long time.

08:41.112 --> 08:43.213
Uh, there’s always been
several possibilities

08:43.213 --> 08:45.050
of human existence in space.

08:46.491 --> 08:52.761
we decided to build our own
space station, our own planet.

08:53.828 --> 08:55.896
Go further.

08:55.896 --> 08:57.700
Be better.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.604
For the planet. For the future.

09:00.604 --> 09:02.573
For all of us.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.806
How will you rise?

09:04.806 --> 09:07.479
Yeah, what... what’s that
got to do with us?

09:07.479 --> 09:10.515
Right, so I’m here
because of the installation.

09:10.515 --> 09:12.913
Ah, the first wave
of temporary resettlement.

09:12.913 --> 09:15.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I think
I heard about this shit once.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.247
You did?
- Looks pretty ridiculous.

09:17.247 --> 09:19.249
I mean, why would you
spend money up there

09:19.249 --> 09:21.119
when you should
be fixing things here?

09:21.119 --> 09:24.122
Well, see,
our motivation is proactive,

09:24.122 --> 09:26.256
to help
our children’s children.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.700
Do you have kids?

09:32.570 --> 09:34.638
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

09:40.270 --> 09:41.579
Yeah.

09:41.579 --> 09:43.207
I’ll have a beer, yeah.
- Yeah.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.517
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

09:49.884 --> 09:51.655
It’s hot.

09:51.655 --> 09:53.591
I’m used to air conditioning.

09:53.591 --> 09:54.889
Right.
Yeah.

09:56.561 --> 09:59.861
Do you remember a time when
there were farms around here?

10:01.632 --> 10:06.802
With livestock, and crops.
Real farms, no offense.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.607
Mm-hm.

10:10.839 --> 10:13.743
Yeah, only as a kid, though.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.745
Must have been bought up
or burned.

10:15.745 --> 10:19.243
- Burned?
- Yeah. By the corporations.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.915
They burn all the old farms,

10:20.915 --> 10:22.851
clearing the fields
for their hybrid stuff.

10:22.851 --> 10:24.622
They don’t give a shit.

10:24.622 --> 10:26.987
I noticed all the canola
on the drive on the way in.

10:26.987 --> 10:28.890
I didn’t realize
it grew this time of year.

10:28.890 --> 10:31.563
All year round.
Barely needs water.

10:31.563 --> 10:33.092
Doesn’t seem natural.

10:33.092 --> 10:34.599
It’s not.

10:36.095 --> 10:38.262
Man, you could...

10:38.262 --> 10:41.199
you could do whatever you want
out here.

10:42.673 --> 10:44.675
Here you go.

10:44.675 --> 10:45.940
Thank you.

10:47.579 --> 10:50.109
Oh, yeah, you won’t get
water like that in the city.

10:50.109 --> 10:52.309
- Thanks.
- Yeah. I do love it.

10:53.948 --> 10:55.345
Mmm.

10:55.345 --> 10:56.786
Cheers.

10:58.084 --> 11:02.055
So, I’ve been assigned
to your file.

11:02.055 --> 11:03.760
We have a file?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.630
You didn’t sign us up
for anything, did you?

11:06.829 --> 11:08.193
No.

11:08.193 --> 11:10.261
OK, so this guy just showed up
out of nowhere, right?

11:10.261 --> 11:11.669
Yeah, it’s not my fault...

11:11.669 --> 11:13.231
Wouldn’t be the first
fucking time...

11:13.231 --> 11:15.640
No, it’s true.
No, you didn’t, you didn’t.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.071
Um, but we’ve had
our first lottery.

11:18.071 --> 11:24.143
I’m excited to say
that you’ve made the shortlist.

11:24.143 --> 11:28.048
You’re one step closer
to living up there.

11:28.048 --> 11:30.215
OK...

11:30.215 --> 11:33.691
OK, well,
you’re wasting your time

11:33.691 --> 11:36.991
because we... we haven’t
even been on an airplane,

11:36.991 --> 11:38.993
and she’d... she’d hate it.

11:38.993 --> 11:41.325
Oh, so you wouldn’t?
You wouldn’t hate it?

11:41.325 --> 11:43.833
I...I’m just saying
you wouldn’t like flying.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.835
You’ve also never been
on an airplane.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.233
OK, we both don’t fucking like
flying. What’s the big deal?

11:48.233 --> 11:51.236
Alright, I should... I should
clarify, sorry. Um...

11:51.236 --> 11:54.206
I’m talking about you here,
Junior. Only you.

11:54.206 --> 11:55.878
What...?

11:55.878 --> 11:58.683
These tests require
real physical strength,

11:58.683 --> 12:01.246
specific skills,
all of which you have, Junior.

12:01.246 --> 12:04.249
Wait, wait, wait, you’re not
fucking around, right?

12:05.250 --> 12:07.021
No, this is just a warning.

12:09.727 --> 12:11.993
Sorry.

12:11.993 --> 12:13.863
Sorry, warning’s
the wrong word.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.733
This is... this is good news.

12:15.733 --> 12:17.295
It’s good news?

12:17.295 --> 12:20.969
And the... the government
knows about this, right?

12:20.969 --> 12:22.399
We are the government.

12:22.399 --> 12:26.172
Our space station
is orbiting Earth as we speak.

12:26.172 --> 12:28.339
And what if... what if
I just say no, right?

12:28.339 --> 12:30.110
If I just refuse.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.749
What happens then?

12:33.245 --> 12:36.050
You do know about conscription?

12:36.050 --> 12:37.348
During the old wars,

12:37.348 --> 12:39.383
if-if you were picked,
you had to go to war.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.759
And if you didn’t, well...

12:43.992 --> 12:45.158
Yeah.

12:49.096 --> 12:50.867
Are you threatening us?

12:51.835 --> 12:53.397
- Junior.
- Is that what’s happening?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.838
Junior.
- No, no.

12:54.838 --> 12:56.268
Are... are you
threatening us?

12:57.269 --> 12:59.139
We could lose the farm.

13:01.471 --> 13:05.145
Let’s not focus
on the rule of law here, OK?

13:05.145 --> 13:07.752
This operation
could end up being

13:07.752 --> 13:11.888
the biggest public initiative
ever, OK?

13:11.888 --> 13:14.319
You’d be a hero, Junior.

13:14.319 --> 13:16.420
Do you want to live
mundane lives

13:16.420 --> 13:18.730
like everyone else,

13:18.730 --> 13:22.030
or do you want to be part of
something special and unique?

13:22.030 --> 13:25.165
Because that’s what
this is really about.

13:25.165 --> 13:27.365
A chance to be
a better version of yourself.

13:27.365 --> 13:29.169
Sounds pretty good.

13:29.169 --> 13:31.303
Listen,
it’s time to move on.

13:31.303 --> 13:34.372
Soon, most of us
won’t be able to live here.

13:34.372 --> 13:36.979
Our planet was marvelous -
is marvelous -

13:36.979 --> 13:39.245
but it’s given us all it can.

13:39.245 --> 13:42.149
No, it didn’t give us anything.
We stole it.

13:42.149 --> 13:44.921
How long’s
the shortlist?

13:44.921 --> 13:46.384
I can’t reveal that.
- Wait...

13:46.384 --> 13:48.793
But what I can tell you is
that nothing will be decided

13:48.793 --> 13:49.959
for a couple of years.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.323
A couple of years?

13:51.323 --> 13:53.160
Yeah, sadly,
these tests

13:53.160 --> 13:54.799
will run
in two-year cycles.

13:54.799 --> 13:57.032
Right, so you expect us
to just go on living

13:57.032 --> 13:59.133
like everything’s normal?

14:00.266 --> 14:03.170
Yes. Because it is.

14:04.237 --> 14:06.008
Nothing’s been decided yet.

14:07.141 --> 14:08.373
Mm-hm.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.160
You look after that
wee Henrietta for me.

14:27.832 --> 14:29.900
These kinds of things
can be upsetting.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

15:24.988 --> 15:26.187
Really?

15:27.859 --> 15:31.962
Are you just gonna
go to sleep after that, huh?

15:31.962 --> 15:33.964
Sorry.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.967
Can we talk tomorrow?
I’m not feeling well.

15:38.331 --> 15:41.400
No, we should
talk about this now.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.338
Do you think you could sleep
in the guest room tonight?

15:45.338 --> 15:47.637
I just don’t want you
to catch anything.

15:54.952 --> 15:57.152
Since when has that mattered, huh?

15:59.616 --> 16:01.552
I’d rather be alone.

16:04.126 --> 16:06.623
You’re serious. You want me
to sleep in the guest room?

16:06.623 --> 16:07.932
Please.

16:16.270 --> 16:18.602
- How did you know?

16:19.570 --> 16:21.407
How did I know what?

16:22.342 --> 16:26.181
Before he got... Hen.

16:26.181 --> 16:28.953
Before he got out, you said,
"He must want something."

16:28.953 --> 16:30.482
How did you know it was a man?

16:30.482 --> 16:32.187
I don’t know,
is that what I said?

16:32.187 --> 16:34.585
Yeah, when the car pulled up.
Oh, I don’t know.

16:34.585 --> 16:36.191
It wasn’t intentional.

16:36.191 --> 16:38.424
I mean, if I said it, it was
probably without thinking.

16:38.424 --> 16:39.656
Listen, I’m exhausted,

16:39.656 --> 16:41.658
and if it’s OK,
I just want to go to sleep...

16:41.658 --> 16:43.594
When you said it,
it was so certain, so...

16:43.594 --> 16:45.134
OK, well, name one woman

16:45.134 --> 16:47.103
that would drive up here
at night, alone, hmm?

16:47.103 --> 16:48.632
The way he was
looking at you...

16:48.632 --> 16:50.271
Why are you pushing me?

17:02.547 --> 17:03.713
OK.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.494
Could you shut the door?

17:17.661 --> 17:19.168
Sure.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.746
Wow.

17:38.055 --> 17:39.386
Wow.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.126
Oh...

17:43.126 --> 17:44.655
Just beautiful!

17:46.393 --> 17:47.658
Fuck me.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.337
Fuck.

18:04.147 --> 18:06.314

21:08.628 --> 21:10.927
You know
we won’t see him again.

21:10.927 --> 21:13.666
They’re not actually interested
in someone like me.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.800
What have I got to offer?

21:15.800 --> 21:16.933
Hm.

21:18.209 --> 21:20.739
You might be surprised.

21:23.511 --> 21:25.909
Do me a favor?
What?

21:25.909 --> 21:27.812
Stop wearing that shirt.

21:30.518 --> 21:33.917
Why? I like this shirt.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.690
You were wearing it
the day we met.

21:39.956 --> 21:42.794
And the more you wear it,
the more worn out it’ll get.

21:46.699 --> 21:47.799
Hm.

21:49.438 --> 21:52.507
So, what else do you remember
about that day?

21:54.476 --> 21:56.346
We were happy.

23:09.716 --> 23:11.355
I miss you.

24:15.452 --> 24:17.652
Do you still
like living here?

24:18.719 --> 24:19.819
Why?

24:21.887 --> 24:24.428
Do you feel happy here?

24:25.528 --> 24:27.662
Of course I’m happy here.

24:27.662 --> 24:29.092
Aren’t you?

24:31.468 --> 24:33.470
What am I to you?

24:34.900 --> 24:37.969
Oh, you know, if this is
about me leaving,

24:37.969 --> 24:39.674
if you’re worried about that...

24:39.674 --> 24:41.676
No it’s not, it’s not.
It’s about us.

24:41.676 --> 24:43.447
Us?
- Yeah.

24:46.978 --> 24:50.014
Did you have any questions
when we got married?

24:50.014 --> 24:52.555
There shouldn’t be questions.

24:52.555 --> 24:53.985
We all have questions.

24:53.985 --> 24:55.888
Well, not when
you take your vows.

24:57.659 --> 25:01.190
So in seven years,
you’ve never felt any doubt?

25:01.190 --> 25:03.830
Never.

25:03.830 --> 25:06.833
Getting married straight out
of school doesn’t worry you,

25:06.833 --> 25:09.737
- when you’re still a teenager?
- We weren’t school friends.

25:09.737 --> 25:11.442
And we’re different.

25:12.806 --> 25:14.874
We met at the right time.

25:16.106 --> 25:17.844
Sorry I’ve been distant.

25:17.844 --> 25:19.549
It’s OK.

25:24.917 --> 25:27.623
What do you think about more,
the past or the future?

25:27.623 --> 25:29.152
What?

25:29.152 --> 25:32.089
Jesus, what is this?
- Sorry.

25:32.089 --> 25:33.596
Oh...

25:33.596 --> 25:35.664
I don’t mean to pepper you
with questions like this

25:35.664 --> 25:38.227
first thing in the morning,
but I really want to know.

25:38.227 --> 25:39.668
OK.

25:41.967 --> 25:44.640
Uh, I think...

25:45.806 --> 25:47.511
...we need a bigger bed.

25:50.745 --> 25:53.616
I was asking you
a serious question.

25:53.616 --> 25:54.782
I know.

25:55.783 --> 25:57.488
You’re not taking me seriously.

25:57.488 --> 25:59.721
- I’m sorry.
- No, you’re not.

25:59.721 --> 26:00.920
No, I’m not.

26:01.921 --> 26:03.758
OK, I’m sorry, babe.

26:04.858 --> 26:06.794
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.664
Coo-ee!

26:47.769 --> 26:49.133
Coo-ee!

28:31.708 --> 28:34.304
To get the best understanding
of life up there,

28:34.304 --> 28:36.680
the selected group
needs to be random.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.912
All walks of life.

28:37.912 --> 28:39.375
OK, so pick someone else, Terrance.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.113
People like us
don’t belong in space.

28:41.113 --> 28:42.653
But that’s the whole point.

28:42.653 --> 28:45.854
At some stage, all of us
may need to go. Permanently.

28:47.284 --> 28:50.122
You’ll receive
handsome compensation.

28:50.122 --> 28:52.223
A thank-you from the government.

28:53.994 --> 28:56.733
Look, you’ve been gifted
a rare opportunity

28:56.733 --> 28:58.394
that for now seems daunting.

28:58.394 --> 29:01.672
But why does the unknown
have to be a burden?

29:01.672 --> 29:04.972
Junior, this is
incredibly rare, OK?

29:04.972 --> 29:07.403
And you’ve been selected.

29:07.403 --> 29:09.207
You’re going to
the installation.

29:09.207 --> 29:11.913
No, no, listen to me. I don’t
like how you just show up here,

29:11.913 --> 29:13.882
and you say all this shit
and you act

29:13.882 --> 29:16.115
like we should be thanking you.

29:16.115 --> 29:18.953
And if it’s such... if it’s such
a fucking great opportunity,

29:18.953 --> 29:22.121
why is it only you
that shows up here?

29:22.121 --> 29:25.157
Where the fuck
is everyone else, Terrance?

29:25.157 --> 29:27.060
Would it help
if there were more people

29:27.060 --> 29:28.864
scurrying around your house
and property?

29:30.426 --> 29:32.164
What’s in your bags?

29:32.164 --> 29:34.430
I thought
I’d drop some things off.

29:34.430 --> 29:38.071
I’ll have to stay,
now that it’s official.

29:38.071 --> 29:40.007
Here? You’re staying here?

29:40.007 --> 29:41.844
If you recall
from my last visit, Hen...

29:41.844 --> 29:44.044
I thought we still
had longer together, Terrance.

29:44.044 --> 29:46.178
...it was all
explained in the paperwork.

29:46.178 --> 29:47.916
I assume there’s a guest room?

29:47.916 --> 29:49.819
This is bullshit.
- Why?

29:49.819 --> 29:51.986
There are
a series of steps to complete.

29:51.986 --> 29:53.889
Observations,
data to collect...

29:53.889 --> 29:55.825
When does he leave?

29:55.825 --> 29:57.827
Couple of weeks.

29:58.993 --> 30:00.357
Why?

30:00.357 --> 30:03.426
This next stage
is going to go fast.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.363
Look, I’ll stay nearby for now.

30:06.363 --> 30:08.365
Give you guys
a little more alone time.

30:08.365 --> 30:09.971
Come here, come here.

30:09.971 --> 30:11.742
Shh. Shh, shh.

30:11.742 --> 30:13.469
It’s OK, baby.
It’s OK. Shh.

30:13.469 --> 30:14.844
Shh, shh.

30:48.207 --> 30:50.341
♪ Why does the sun... ♪

30:50.341 --> 30:51.540
Come on.

30:51.540 --> 30:55.049

30:55.049 --> 31:02.122

31:12.066 --> 31:14.002
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:15.201 --> 31:16.532
Hey, these are mine!

31:16.532 --> 31:19.271
Yeah, well, you never wear ’em,
and they stink.

31:19.271 --> 31:22.142
Well, I hate breaking in
new gloves, so...

31:22.142 --> 31:24.111
This is why
we have so much stuff,

31:24.111 --> 31:26.113
because you can’t let go.
Of anything.

31:26.113 --> 31:27.884
What do...
what do you mean by that?

31:27.884 --> 31:29.919
It means that all of this
is just shit.

31:29.919 --> 31:31.580
It’s stuff from your past,
not ours.

31:31.580 --> 31:34.022
OK, and if you start
throwing things out randomly...

31:34.022 --> 31:35.287
Stop it, OK?

31:37.058 --> 31:39.027
I...I need this stuff.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.295
Your face is flushed.
- Well...

31:43.295 --> 31:45.066
I... Hen, I just...

31:45.066 --> 31:47.596
Listen, I just wish that
you wouldn’t get like this,

31:47.596 --> 31:49.070
especially tonight.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.940
Why? What’s so special
about tonight?

31:50.940 --> 31:52.843
Because it’s our last chance
to be alone.

31:52.843 --> 31:56.143
Oh, God, yeah, and I guess you
just wanted a quiet night in?

31:56.143 --> 31:58.376
- Just like the old days? Yeah?
- OK,

31:58.376 --> 32:01.181
we haven’t even talked about
me leaving and you’re acting

32:01.181 --> 32:03.612
like this is no big deal,
like it’s not even happening.

32:03.612 --> 32:05.581
- Give me that!
- Fucking talk to me!

32:05.581 --> 32:09.123
This is happening faster
than I was expecting it to.

32:09.123 --> 32:10.993
And now he’s coming to stay.

32:10.993 --> 32:13.226
OK, well... so why are you
cleaning the fucking house?

32:13.226 --> 32:16.064
Just give me the...! I don’t
want you stressing over him.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.066
- I’m not stressing.
- OK, then, what is it?

32:18.066 --> 32:21.135
What is it? Look at me.
Look at me.

32:21.135 --> 32:23.170
I’m really worried about you,
OK?

32:24.974 --> 32:26.173
Hey.

32:27.911 --> 32:33.609
Hen? I’m going away for years,
OK? It’s not days.

32:33.609 --> 32:35.644
I’m worried
about leaving you here alone.

32:35.644 --> 32:37.954
You don’t have to
worry about that, Junior.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.453
Fuck!
What?

32:45.093 --> 32:46.930
That. In there.

32:54.069 --> 32:57.435
Oh.
I’ve never seen one like it.

32:57.435 --> 33:00.273
They’re getting bigger. God,
I hope it’s not an infestation.

33:00.273 --> 33:02.638
They’ll get into the walls.
Christ, that’s all I need.

33:02.638 --> 33:05.311
It’s only one.

33:05.311 --> 33:07.379
Well, one is too many.
- Mm.

33:09.612 --> 33:12.153
I’m checking our room for more.

33:15.255 --> 33:16.487
Hey.

33:18.291 --> 33:19.996
Hey, little guy.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.691
Junior.

33:22.691 --> 33:24.528
What is it?
You’re staring.

33:24.528 --> 33:27.069
Don’t... Ah...
It’s OK, I’ll take care of it.

33:28.037 --> 33:29.467
Hmm?

33:36.243 --> 33:38.212
Why aren’t you moving?

34:28.658 --> 34:30.132
Here you go.

34:33.333 --> 34:36.270
What are you doing here?
What’s wrong?

34:36.270 --> 34:38.602
I, uh...

34:38.602 --> 34:41.539
I started thinking
about leaving.

34:41.539 --> 34:44.575
The things I’ll miss,
things that aren’t obvious.

34:44.575 --> 34:46.478
Maybe we should talk
about this outside...

34:46.478 --> 34:51.681
No, no, no, just like
stupid little things like...

34:51.681 --> 34:54.552
Like how by the sound
of the floor creaking,

34:54.552 --> 34:56.554
I know that
it’s your steps upstairs.

34:58.061 --> 35:01.328
And nobody
could ever recognize that.

35:01.328 --> 35:03.297
It feels like
a secret between us.

35:03.297 --> 35:04.430
It’s...

35:06.069 --> 35:08.599
I’ll miss hearing those steps.

35:08.599 --> 35:11.074
Hey, Junior.
- What?

35:11.074 --> 35:13.340
Can we just
talk about this tonight?

35:13.340 --> 35:16.244
- You know we need this job.
- No, let’s just be together.

35:17.278 --> 35:18.708
Like right now.

35:20.314 --> 35:21.678
- Hmm?

35:21.678 --> 35:23.581
None of this matters.

36:30.879 --> 36:34.157
Strange, how dying
can still be beautiful. Hm.

36:35.290 --> 36:36.885
Are you afraid
of dying?

36:39.756 --> 36:42.165
Maybe of not being ready.

37:07.553 --> 37:12.195
Have you ever thought,
what if we’re not actually...

37:12.195 --> 37:15.231
looking up at the sky?

37:16.529 --> 37:19.202
What if we’re actually
looking down?

37:21.204 --> 37:23.371
The sky below us.

37:24.471 --> 37:26.836
Try. Think about it.

37:39.816 --> 37:42.225
Oh.

37:44.227 --> 37:46.559
- See?
- Oh, yeah.

37:49.727 --> 37:51.465
Give me my pants!

37:51.465 --> 37:52.631
Whoo-oo!

37:52.631 --> 37:54.930
Hen, I’m serious.

37:58.505 --> 38:00.441
Wha-hey!

38:09.582 --> 38:11.815
Why don’t we just disappear?

38:11.815 --> 38:13.520
Get out of here?

38:25.928 --> 38:27.369
Oh.

38:35.971 --> 38:38.941
Hello. Hi.

38:39.909 --> 38:41.614
Look at you.

38:42.648 --> 38:44.287
I’m not gonna hurt you.

38:44.980 --> 38:46.256
Come here.

38:48.984 --> 38:52.922
It’s OK. Good boy.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.497
What happened to you, hey?

38:58.268 --> 39:00.270
Where did you come from?

39:02.899 --> 39:04.637
It’s OK.

39:04.637 --> 39:07.508
There you go. See? Good boy.

39:09.004 --> 39:10.478
Junior?

39:11.578 --> 39:12.777
Junior!

39:14.614 --> 39:16.748
Oh, shit. Junior!

39:18.882 --> 39:21.291
Junior! Fuck.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.622
Junior!

39:24.987 --> 39:26.593
Stop!

39:27.792 --> 39:29.497
Where are you going?

39:36.900 --> 39:38.440
Junior!

40:21.483 --> 40:23.012
No! Fuck off! No!

40:24.420 --> 40:25.619
Junior!

40:25.619 --> 40:27.588
Don’t hurt him.
It’s not his fault!

40:51.040 --> 40:53.383
Hey...
- Are you OK?

40:53.383 --> 40:56.386
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

40:57.783 --> 41:00.049
Did they hurt you?

41:00.049 --> 41:02.788
- Who?
- Are you hurt?

41:02.788 --> 41:05.725
- I’m OK.
- There were men and...

41:05.725 --> 41:07.859
- No, no, no, no.
- You... you were screaming.

41:07.859 --> 41:09.795
No, they were just
burning an old barn.

41:09.795 --> 41:12.468
You’re confused.
You hurt yourself.

41:12.468 --> 41:14.569
But you’re gonna be OK.

41:14.569 --> 41:16.406
You’re lucky.
- No, we...

41:16.406 --> 41:18.639
We need to tell someone
about what’s happening.

41:18.639 --> 41:20.410
Tell them what? Tell them what?

41:20.410 --> 41:22.445
You had an accident,
that’s all.

41:22.445 --> 41:24.942
No, no, no,
we’re in danger, baby, OK?

41:24.942 --> 41:27.846
Junior. Junior.

41:27.846 --> 41:30.915
You’re the one
that ran into the fire.

41:32.785 --> 41:36.052
Why would you do that, hmm?

41:36.052 --> 41:39.726
What do you mean?
- What... what was in the fire?

41:39.726 --> 41:42.498
I hope this wasn’t done intentionally.

41:42.498 --> 41:45.094
You, uh... you think
I did this on purpose?

41:45.094 --> 41:48.163
Well, an injury won’t change
anything. You know that, right?

41:48.163 --> 41:50.473
I can’t feel
this side of my body.

41:50.473 --> 41:51.903
That’s the anesthetic.

41:51.903 --> 41:54.004
It’ll wear off soon.
But you won’t be able

41:54.004 --> 41:55.907
to use that arm much
for a while, though,

41:55.907 --> 41:58.107
and you have to get used
to that recliner of yours.

41:58.107 --> 41:59.515
Why?

41:59.515 --> 42:01.044
Well, you can’t sleep
lying down.

42:01.044 --> 42:03.112
You can recline to
about 45 degrees but that’s it.

42:03.112 --> 42:05.015
What do you mean,
I can’t sleep lying down?

42:05.015 --> 42:06.819
The doctor did
a minor procedure and...

42:06.819 --> 42:08.216
A procedure? What doctor?

42:08.216 --> 42:10.526
She operated on your
injured shoulder, the tendon.

42:10.526 --> 42:12.726
It went very well, but she’d
like to leave it covered.

42:17.126 --> 42:19.931
Ah, here. You gotta take these.

42:35.716 --> 42:37.652
Jacqueline du Pre.

42:41.084 --> 42:46.496
"A musician of nature
with an unerring instinct."

42:47.959 --> 42:49.928
That’s how her husband
described her.

42:55.736 --> 43:00.543
I know this hasn’t been easy
on either of you.

43:00.543 --> 43:03.546
But soon,
all of this will be behind us.

43:03.546 --> 43:07.946
So I would like to congratulate
you on making it this far.

43:09.585 --> 43:12.687
South of France.
The real thing.

43:12.687 --> 43:16.218
Why are you following me?

43:16.218 --> 43:19.529
I’m keeping you safe,
both of you. It’s crucial.

43:19.529 --> 43:21.960
Both of us? What...?

43:21.960 --> 43:23.764
We’re taking Junior away.

43:23.764 --> 43:25.931
You’ve never been all alone
out here before.

43:25.931 --> 43:29.000
Yeah, so?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.904
Could be a real strain on her.
On your marriage.

43:31.904 --> 43:34.104
You’re the one
that’s forcing me to leave her.

43:34.104 --> 43:36.612
Well, so we have to do
what’s moral.

43:36.612 --> 43:39.043
And what do you consider
to be moral?

43:40.847 --> 43:42.783
We’re going to replace you.

43:42.783 --> 43:45.115
What, me?

43:45.115 --> 43:47.953
We’re going to ensure Hen
has company while you’re away.

43:47.953 --> 43:50.758
No, fuck off. There’s no
fucking way that’s happening.

43:52.089 --> 43:54.861
What, do you really want
to leave her here all alone?

43:54.861 --> 43:56.566
Day after day?
Night after night?

43:56.566 --> 43:58.029
She can handle herself, Terrance.

43:58.029 --> 44:00.603
Sorry, why doesn’t anybody
ask me how I feel about it?

44:00.603 --> 44:02.264
Cos I’m right fucking here.
- Calm down.

44:02.264 --> 44:04.673
No, no, no,
you fucking calm down.

44:04.673 --> 44:07.071
Hear me out, OK?

44:07.071 --> 44:09.942
It’s not another man.

44:09.942 --> 44:12.109
We’re developing
a biological replacement.

44:12.109 --> 44:13.649
Oh, my God.

44:13.649 --> 44:15.310
What the fuck
is he talking about?

44:15.310 --> 44:17.752
In the old days,
you would have left Hen with

44:17.752 --> 44:19.952
a two-dimensional photo
of yourself.

44:19.952 --> 44:21.954
This is the next step, OK?

44:21.954 --> 44:25.727
A dynamic copy of you,
with living tissue,

44:25.727 --> 44:28.257
- volume and a body.
- I don’t want a fucking robot

44:28.257 --> 44:29.995
living with my wife.

44:29.995 --> 44:32.635
Ah, it’s not a robot, OK?

44:32.635 --> 44:35.605
It’s a new kind
of self-determining life form.

44:35.605 --> 44:40.203
The first to live in a domestic
setting as freely as you do.

44:40.203 --> 44:42.304
You’ll see.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.680
It’s going to be astonishing.

44:45.813 --> 44:47.716
There’s a series
of interviews, OK?

44:47.716 --> 44:49.212
No detail is inconsequential.

44:49.212 --> 44:52.281
Only to observe you
and record your daily routine.

44:52.281 --> 44:55.823
That’s why you’re staying.
- This is fucking insane.

44:55.823 --> 44:59.057
For example, what did you
have for breakfast, my man?

44:59.057 --> 45:02.698
OK.
Look.

45:02.698 --> 45:06.196
OuterMore has a duty of care
to those left behind.

45:07.967 --> 45:11.872
You know what my dad
used to get us to do?

45:11.872 --> 45:14.303
What’s that?
- Test of manhood.

45:14.303 --> 45:17.207
- Don’t be an idiot.
- We’d go outside, stand apart

45:17.207 --> 45:19.209
and we each got one punch
at the other.

45:21.310 --> 45:22.982
Oh, you’d punch each other?

45:22.982 --> 45:25.116
- Yeah, you ever punch someone?

45:25.116 --> 45:27.316
Mm, can’t say I have.
- Mm.

45:27.316 --> 45:29.758
I guess that’s what being
a man is, though, right?

45:29.758 --> 45:31.727
Hen, I am just having
a conversation.

45:31.727 --> 45:33.696
So would you do
your test of manhood with me?

45:33.696 --> 45:35.192
Now you’re just being dumb.

45:45.037 --> 45:46.302
Fuck.

46:10.161 --> 46:12.064
As air quality continues

46:12.064 --> 46:13.329
to decline worldwide,

46:13.329 --> 46:15.100
an estimated 1 billion children

46:15.100 --> 46:17.806
remain at risk of developing
respiratory disease.

46:17.806 --> 46:21.073
According to the UN,
820 million children

46:21.073 --> 46:23.339
have experienced
prolonged mega-droughts

46:23.339 --> 46:26.177
and have never seen rain
in their lifetimes.

46:26.177 --> 46:28.443
We now go live
to the Earth Concert stage.

46:28.443 --> 46:30.214
Buzz has been building all day

46:30.214 --> 46:33.756
for this historic performance
of music icons.

46:33.756 --> 46:35.725
Sarita, can you hear me?

46:35.725 --> 46:38.893
Jay, the
energy down here is electric!

46:38.893 --> 46:40.730
An unbelievable line-up,

46:40.730 --> 46:43.733
the likes of which hasn’t been
seen since the Live Aid show

46:43.733 --> 46:45.229
back in the 20th century.

46:45.229 --> 46:47.935
Once again standing up
for what they insist

46:47.935 --> 46:50.938
is the greatest emergency
of this generation.

46:50.938 --> 46:54.040
There is no more time left
for talk and debate

46:54.040 --> 46:58.044
but to offset the centuries
of exploitation and neglect.

46:58.044 --> 47:00.079
The crowds here are huge and...

47:00.079 --> 47:02.312
♪ Yeah
I have dreamed the dream

47:02.312 --> 47:04.116
♪ I have dreamed the dream

47:04.116 --> 47:07.119
♪ Of every common man
♪ Of a common man

47:07.119 --> 47:09.187
♪ Hoping to rise

47:09.187 --> 47:11.288
♪ Hoping to rise... ♪

47:13.829 --> 47:15.358
♪ I have sworn by my blood... ♪

47:15.358 --> 47:18.999
Terrance, I don’t care
what you’re planning, OK?

47:18.999 --> 47:21.199
But whatever you bring here,
it won’t be me,

47:21.199 --> 47:24.235
you know,
cos I can’t be replaced.

47:24.235 --> 47:26.875
Nothing wrong
with a growing self-confidence.

47:26.875 --> 47:30.208
Just make sure for your own
sake it never hurts Hen.

47:35.180 --> 47:36.951
Have you ever hurt her?

47:41.384 --> 47:42.517
Fuck!

47:47.522 --> 47:49.524
No hands!

47:51.130 --> 47:54.232
Whoo! Whoo!

47:57.169 --> 47:59.072
Whoo!

48:15.022 --> 48:18.157
Any hook, any chicken,
it doesn’t matter.

48:18.157 --> 48:19.587
I’m glad the pills

48:19.587 --> 48:21.259
are working on your shoulder.

48:21.259 --> 48:23.063
I do feel energized.

48:23.063 --> 48:24.559
Because
in the coming days

48:24.559 --> 48:26.264
you will be under
enormous physical

48:26.264 --> 48:27.903
and psychological pressure.

48:30.235 --> 48:32.908
OK. You ready?

48:32.908 --> 48:34.074
Alright.

48:43.083 --> 48:45.151
You have to
get used to these tests.

48:45.151 --> 48:48.154
There are more when you arrive,
some less pleasant than others.

48:51.091 --> 48:52.521
Oh, fuck.

48:52.521 --> 48:56.899
Deep tendon carpal-tunnel
reflex test.

48:56.899 --> 48:58.868
I’m so sorry. It’s done.

49:05.369 --> 49:08.042
- Done at work already?
- Why is he facing the wall?

49:08.042 --> 49:09.571
Hen,
you can’t be here.

49:10.979 --> 49:12.574
I think he’s had enough.

49:12.574 --> 49:14.642
You OK?
Uh-huh.

49:14.642 --> 49:16.215
We agreed.

49:20.923 --> 49:22.353
Be downstairs.
- Yep.

49:29.228 --> 49:31.032
What the fuck
was that?

49:35.267 --> 49:38.402
Yeah, we really need
to make sure she’s OK.

49:40.239 --> 49:42.109
If you notice anything unusual,

49:42.109 --> 49:46.377
or if she’s acting odd,
it’s best you tell me.

49:46.377 --> 49:48.115
OK.
If we’re to help her

49:48.115 --> 49:49.919
while you’re away,

49:49.919 --> 49:53.186
your replacement will
need to know what you know.

49:53.186 --> 49:56.420
I need to have an intimate
understanding of your marriage,

49:56.420 --> 49:58.026
the good and the bad.

49:59.621 --> 50:01.425
And anything
you tell me up here,

50:01.425 --> 50:03.394
I promise it’s confidential.

50:03.394 --> 50:05.330
It’s between you and me.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.268
You can handle that, right?

50:09.268 --> 50:10.500
Mm-hm.

50:12.040 --> 50:15.307
This is more
than saving the farm, Junior.

50:15.307 --> 50:17.507
It’s about ensuring
your marriage survives

50:17.507 --> 50:19.146
while you’re gone.

50:31.587 --> 50:33.523
Have you ever
cheated on her?

50:33.523 --> 50:34.689
What?

50:36.328 --> 50:37.494
Hen.

50:38.462 --> 50:41.399
No, definitely not.

50:41.399 --> 50:43.632
You never fantasized
about another woman?

50:43.632 --> 50:45.040
Ahh...

50:45.040 --> 50:47.306
Come on.
- No, I don’t know. I...

50:47.306 --> 50:49.143
No. I, um...

50:51.013 --> 50:52.641
Has she ever
cheated on you?

50:52.641 --> 50:54.313
Oh, fuck you.
Has she?

50:54.313 --> 50:56.381
No.

50:56.381 --> 50:58.647
You’re not
basing that on trust, are you?

50:58.647 --> 51:00.385
I’m basing it on what I know.

51:00.385 --> 51:02.156
Do you feel you know

51:02.156 --> 51:04.488
how she would react
in every situation?

51:04.488 --> 51:06.688
Have you ever asked her
the question yourself?

51:06.688 --> 51:08.294
Hen’s not like that.

51:08.294 --> 51:10.098
But you don’t
actually believe

51:10.098 --> 51:12.034
you know Hen better
than she knows herself?

51:12.034 --> 51:14.333
I’m not saying that.
Look, there are

51:14.333 --> 51:17.138
things about her you don’t know
and will never know, OK?

51:17.138 --> 51:20.306
Thoughts, feelings,
all her years before you.

51:25.740 --> 51:27.115
Listen, mate.

51:29.051 --> 51:31.053
Hey.

51:31.053 --> 51:34.650
Look, she has desires
that existed before you

51:34.650 --> 51:37.059
and exist beyond you.

51:39.754 --> 51:42.130
You can accept that, right?
- No, I...

51:42.130 --> 51:43.296
Hey, Junior.

51:58.212 --> 52:00.379
I suppose you want me to stop.

52:02.546 --> 52:05.549
No. Why?

52:06.484 --> 52:08.651
You usually don’t like it.

52:10.092 --> 52:12.193
You used to tell me
not to play.

52:13.161 --> 52:14.657
Sorry?

52:18.265 --> 52:21.664
As long as we move
from day to day,

52:21.664 --> 52:25.272
living the routine
that was established...

52:25.272 --> 52:27.406
that you established...

52:28.737 --> 52:30.805
...you’re convinced I’m happy.

52:34.479 --> 52:38.714
Walking the same path
as everyone who came before me.

52:44.786 --> 52:46.854
Your mom.

52:46.854 --> 52:49.263
My mom.

52:49.263 --> 52:51.331
Their moms. Their moms.

53:15.355 --> 53:17.390
I’m starting to worry.

53:19.821 --> 53:22.758
- What if the rain never comes?
- Mm.

53:22.758 --> 53:24.826
I never want you to worry.

53:27.136 --> 53:28.599
Yeah, I know.

53:49.686 --> 53:53.162
♪ And if you leave me

53:53.162 --> 53:55.593
♪ It’ll break

53:55.593 --> 54:00.268
♪ It’ll break my heart... ♪

54:05.504 --> 54:09.178
I’ve never
talked about this stuff before.

54:09.178 --> 54:12.214
Really?
Mm-hm. Never.

54:13.413 --> 54:15.250
Hen?

54:15.250 --> 54:19.188
I just think having
other living things around...

54:19.188 --> 54:20.684
does something.

54:20.684 --> 54:22.587
Makes you hopeful, I think.

54:25.524 --> 54:27.757
I really miss the trees, though.

54:27.757 --> 54:29.594
Trees, though...

54:29.594 --> 54:32.234
The trees?

54:32.234 --> 54:36.469
Yeah, more of them were
around when I was growing up.

54:36.469 --> 54:40.605
Some were, um...
some were shy.

54:43.410 --> 54:49.350
And then others were
really bold and ancient.

54:49.350 --> 54:52.848
Wise.

54:52.848 --> 54:55.818
You only have to spend time
with them and I just...

54:55.818 --> 54:58.227
I love their personalities
so much.

54:58.227 --> 54:59.558
Personalities?

54:59.558 --> 55:01.395
Junior thinks I’m crazy,

55:01.395 --> 55:03.826
but, I mean, people do.

55:03.826 --> 55:07.698
Dogs do. Cats do.

55:07.698 --> 55:10.437
Why would you draw a line
with trees?

55:12.406 --> 55:15.244
I don’t know.

55:15.244 --> 55:18.973
It’s sad we need proof
to believe in something.

55:18.973 --> 55:21.448
Belief is deceptive.

55:21.448 --> 55:23.384
Mm...

55:23.384 --> 55:27.014
No, it’s not. It’s...

55:27.014 --> 55:29.522
It’s a feeling
and when you have it,

55:29.522 --> 55:32.558
it is... it’s exhilarating.

55:43.998 --> 55:46.968
Can we talk
about the piano?

55:46.968 --> 55:48.343
OK.

55:49.410 --> 55:51.610
Why the basement?

55:51.610 --> 55:54.382
Looks like it hasn’t
been played in years.

55:56.384 --> 55:58.551
He doesn’t like it
when I play.

56:01.686 --> 56:05.723
Maybe it’s what’s in the music
that scares him, I don’t know.

56:05.723 --> 56:07.428
What’s in it?

56:07.428 --> 56:09.694
All that’s gone.

56:11.498 --> 56:13.599
Gone?

56:13.599 --> 56:17.405
Affection. Possibility.

56:17.405 --> 56:22.476
Um... curiosity.
That’s... that’s a big one.

56:25.710 --> 56:27.811
He used to love that about me.

56:30.077 --> 56:33.751
Do you think knowing
Junior for as long as you have

56:33.751 --> 56:36.050
has taken that away?

56:41.330 --> 56:42.661
In the beginning,

56:42.661 --> 56:46.863
everything feels so alive and...

56:46.863 --> 56:49.030
exciting.

56:49.030 --> 56:52.671
But time makes it predictable.

56:52.671 --> 56:55.674
He doesn’t really
see me anymore.

56:55.674 --> 56:59.711
It’s as if he’s replaced me
with someone else.

56:59.711 --> 57:03.616
I’ve lost those parts
of who I am...

57:03.616 --> 57:05.981
or who I could be.

57:05.981 --> 57:09.919
And... I’m scared
I won’t ever get them back.

57:11.723 --> 57:13.989
Maybe I shouldn’t
be telling you this.

57:15.958 --> 57:18.565
Why would you
live with that fear?

57:20.765 --> 57:23.438
Don’t deny yourself
those parts.

57:23.438 --> 57:25.473
No, I don’t want to anymore.

57:25.473 --> 57:27.409
Good. Good.

57:27.409 --> 57:30.610
I encourage you
to use this opportunity

57:30.610 --> 57:33.514
to act on your instincts.

57:35.648 --> 57:37.584
How real will he look?

57:37.584 --> 57:39.080
Identical.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.490
Will he behave
like Junior?

57:42.490 --> 57:44.657
Just like
when you first knew him.

57:46.791 --> 57:48.760

She didn’t
like your dancing?

01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:02.316
No.

01:01:02.316 --> 01:01:05.055

- You’ve been drinking.

01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:34.051
Is there something
bothering you?

01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:35.382
Uh-uh.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.223
I can feel it in you.
- No.

01:01:41.223 --> 01:01:43.698
It’s more like an awakening.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.800
Hm. OK.

01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:54.643
And how has this awakening
affected Hen?

01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:58.207
I sense a little bit
of a strain there, perhaps?

01:01:58.207 --> 01:02:00.748
You’re always wondering
how things are between us.

01:02:00.748 --> 01:02:02.750
It’s fucking sick, Terrance.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.246
I don’t mind
being wrong about that.

01:02:04.246 --> 01:02:05.918
I’m just curious.
- What is that?

01:02:05.918 --> 01:02:07.381
It monitors
your hydration levels.

01:02:07.381 --> 01:02:09.790
Does she tell you
what she likes?

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.022
What’s that?

01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:14.894
Your wife, Junior.

01:02:14.894 --> 01:02:17.732
Is she open and honest
with her preferences?

01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:21.769
- About what?
- Come on. You know.

01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:23.034
Fucking.

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:27.137
Is she explicit
about what she likes?

01:02:27.137 --> 01:02:29.304
What did you just say?
- What she needs.

01:02:29.304 --> 01:02:31.207
- What?
- Every relationship depends

01:02:31.207 --> 01:02:33.044
on open and honest communication.

01:02:33.044 --> 01:02:35.409
Oh, fuck you.
You know that.

01:02:35.409 --> 01:02:38.346
Just relax.
It’s just a conversation.

01:02:43.252 --> 01:02:44.957
What the fuck?

01:02:50.127 --> 01:02:52.261
You like playing with us,
don’t you?

01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:55.231
No. No, I’m...

01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:58.333
People fascinate me, OK?

01:02:58.333 --> 01:03:00.104
You two fascinate me.

01:03:00.104 --> 01:03:01.842
People fascinate me too.

01:03:01.842 --> 01:03:04.713
Really?
- Mm.

01:03:04.713 --> 01:03:07.914
I watch people sometimes.

01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:09.916
See things.

01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.478
What do you see?

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:18.089
The guys in the lunch room, right?

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.390
They bite
hunks of their sandwiches,

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.733
meat and bread,

01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:26.229
and they...

01:03:26.229 --> 01:03:29.067
they grind it together
into some disgusting paste.

01:03:29.067 --> 01:03:32.334
And whatever wasn’t swallowed
would just be stuck...

01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:35.304
between yellow teeth
and infected gums.

01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:42.982
And it’s not just eating.

01:03:42.982 --> 01:03:44.247
No.

01:03:45.919 --> 01:03:47.855
I’ve seen a co-worker
fall asleep

01:03:47.855 --> 01:03:50.451
with his mouth gaping open.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:53.388
And I felt sick
at the sight of it.

01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:56.831
I mean, think about...

01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:00.527
earwax and pus and fingernails.

01:04:00.527 --> 01:04:02.331
I...I...

01:04:04.399 --> 01:04:08.777
I’ve seen guys spit on
the ground and just walk away.

01:04:08.777 --> 01:04:11.978
Just walk away
and they don’t...

01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:15.179
I mean, we’re fucking oblivious
to it most of the time!

01:04:15.179 --> 01:04:17.786
We don’t even fucking see it!

01:04:22.252 --> 01:04:24.188
But one day...

01:04:28.192 --> 01:04:31.129
...I...I started to wonder
why that is.

01:04:33.428 --> 01:04:35.298
And then one of the guys,

01:04:35.298 --> 01:04:38.906
he wipes his fucking nose
with his fucking napkin.

01:04:38.906 --> 01:04:40.941
Just balls it up,
drops it on the plate,

01:04:40.941 --> 01:04:43.108
full of fucking snot.

01:04:46.078 --> 01:04:49.114
And then very slowly...

01:04:49.114 --> 01:04:51.446
it just started to unfurl.

01:04:54.053 --> 01:04:55.549
All on its own.

01:04:57.287 --> 01:04:59.993
As if it wanted to be seen.

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.425
And then, I mean,
that’s when I realized

01:05:03.425 --> 01:05:05.526
our common seam in each of us

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:09.167
is our own
built-in fucking scum.

01:05:11.235 --> 01:05:15.976
Our dirt. Our grease.

01:05:18.176 --> 01:05:19.980
- Fuck you!

01:05:24.886 --> 01:05:26.415
What the hell
is going on?!

01:05:27.856 --> 01:05:29.583
Hen, everything’s fine!

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:31.387
Let me in!
He’s fine!

01:05:31.387 --> 01:05:33.158
- Let me in!
- He’s fine!

01:05:33.158 --> 01:05:35.094
It’s OK!
Junior!

01:05:35.094 --> 01:05:37.459
Stop! He’s fine.
Let me in, Terrance!

01:05:37.459 --> 01:05:39.934
Fucking Terrance,
open the fucking door!

01:05:39.934 --> 01:05:42.101
Go downstairs!
He’s fine!

01:05:44.136 --> 01:05:46.105
No!

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:53.442
Jeez! Hell!

01:06:15.365 --> 01:06:17.334
No.

01:06:21.008 --> 01:06:23.538
This is fucking crazy.

01:06:27.377 --> 01:06:32.085
What’s a boat
without an anchor?

01:06:42.656 --> 01:06:44.427
Little Hen.

01:06:48.596 --> 01:06:50.268
I’m here.

01:07:03.017 --> 01:07:05.118
I was just taking a shower.

01:07:13.423 --> 01:07:15.128
It’s OK.

01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:21.266
Shhh.

01:07:29.142 --> 01:07:34.378
When I get back,
let’s do something.

01:07:36.743 --> 01:07:38.415
Go somewhere.

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:44.652
Make a family.

01:07:49.492 --> 01:07:54.365
But whatever we decide to do,
let’s decide together, OK?

01:07:56.499 --> 01:07:58.270
Mm-hm.

01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:00.041
We’ll be together.

01:08:02.571 --> 01:08:05.079
Like we used to be.

01:10:49.177 --> 01:10:50.772
Fucking cowards!

01:11:48.698 --> 01:11:50.601
Keep a low profile.

01:11:50.601 --> 01:11:52.306
Yes.

01:11:52.306 --> 01:11:54.473
I’m going
to go upstairs and get going.

01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:03.971
When Hen played the piano,

01:13:03.971 --> 01:13:05.643
did you like it?

01:13:05.643 --> 01:13:08.382
Oh, I don’t really remember.

01:13:08.382 --> 01:13:10.043
Why are you asking me that?

01:13:10.043 --> 01:13:12.650
She said you’re
the reason she doesn’t play.

01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:15.752
She told you that?

01:13:18.084 --> 01:13:22.462
When you listened to
it, how did it make you feel?

01:13:25.564 --> 01:13:29.095
I...I enjoyed it
in the beginning, but...

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.703
...it changed her.

01:13:32.703 --> 01:13:34.067
Changed her?

01:13:36.509 --> 01:13:39.908
I didn’t know
who she was when she played,

01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:43.747
like she was trying
to be someone else.

01:13:45.848 --> 01:13:47.982
That was...

01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:50.754
That was a while ago.
- God.

01:13:50.754 --> 01:13:53.790
How does it feel
to listen to that now,

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:55.561
having gone through it?

01:13:58.597 --> 01:14:01.127
I’ve always had this fantasy that...

01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:06.968
...there’s something else
out there for me.

01:14:06.968 --> 01:14:09.443
What do you think
it would take?

01:14:09.443 --> 01:14:11.104
To leave?
Yeah.

01:14:13.139 --> 01:14:14.778
Courage.

01:14:17.979 --> 01:14:21.048
The courage
to let everything go.

01:14:22.654 --> 01:14:24.524
Mm.

01:14:24.524 --> 01:14:26.757
Follow what I feel.

01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:28.594
Not be scared.

01:14:34.633 --> 01:14:37.405
And where would you go?

01:14:37.405 --> 01:14:40.441
There are places. There’s...

01:14:40.441 --> 01:14:44.005
There’s places with life.

01:14:44.005 --> 01:14:46.447
Mmm.
- Places with other people.

01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:49.648
God, with new people.

01:14:50.814 --> 01:14:52.783
With music.

01:14:52.783 --> 01:14:54.752
Mmm.

01:14:54.752 --> 01:14:58.525
Somewhere that just
doesn’t feel like it’s dying.

01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:05.466
And instead of...

01:15:05.466 --> 01:15:07.534
trying to explain that
to him...

01:15:07.534 --> 01:15:09.866
...or to justify it,

01:15:09.866 --> 01:15:12.803
I would just do the opposite.

01:15:12.803 --> 01:15:16.807
I’d leave a letter,
but it would be blank.

01:15:18.842 --> 01:15:20.778
So... so nothing at all?

01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:28.951
It would say nothing and
everything at the same time.

01:15:28.951 --> 01:15:30.920
Oh...

01:15:37.531 --> 01:15:41.029
You know I can
help you, if you do decide.

01:15:41.029 --> 01:15:43.130
I know what he needs.
- I’ll be OK.

01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:44.835
Yeah.

01:15:53.712 --> 01:15:55.549
You’re a lying piece of shit.

01:15:55.549 --> 01:15:57.111
We’re going to
clarify everything.

01:15:57.111 --> 01:15:59.113
Oh, it’s pretty fucking
obvious, though.

01:15:59.113 --> 01:16:01.687
So, tell me.
- No, this is over, Terrance.

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.656
You’re fucking leaving now.

01:16:03.656 --> 01:16:05.185
And, baby, we’re gonna talk.

01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:07.825
Baby, you’re gonna talk to
me properly. No more bullshit.

01:16:07.825 --> 01:16:09.728
What do you think is going on?

01:16:09.728 --> 01:16:13.028
No, no, no, no. No more
fucking questions, Terrance.

01:16:13.028 --> 01:16:15.129
Hen, this has got to stop, OK?

01:16:15.129 --> 01:16:16.636
OK.

01:16:18.066 --> 01:16:21.069
Yeah. Yeah, you want my wife,
don’t you?

01:16:21.069 --> 01:16:23.940
Yeah? Yeah, you want to keep
her company while I’m gone.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.271
Calm down. Calm down.

01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:27.515
You’re fucking sick,
Terrance!

01:16:27.515 --> 01:16:29.209
Hey, hey, it’s OK.

01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:31.046
Junior! Junior. Stop.

01:16:31.046 --> 01:16:33.213
Hey. Hey.
It’s not what you think.

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:34.918
It’s not what you think.

01:16:37.184 --> 01:16:38.955
Fucking do something.

01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:50.032
♪ Although the sun is shining

01:16:50.032 --> 01:16:52.265
♪ High above

01:16:54.168 --> 01:16:57.138
♪ The one thing on my mind

01:16:57.138 --> 01:16:59.580
♪ Is you my love... ♪
It’s OK.

01:17:00.306 --> 01:17:01.648
No!

01:18:08.847 --> 01:18:13.280
Hey. I’ve missed you.

01:18:18.219 --> 01:18:20.089
It’s so good
to be back.

01:18:38.074 --> 01:18:39.779
It’s time.

01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:43.816
OK.

01:18:43.816 --> 01:18:45.752
You coming?

01:18:45.752 --> 01:18:47.116
You go.

01:18:48.414 --> 01:18:49.789
OK.

01:19:07.037 --> 01:19:09.941
No, you fucking calm down...

01:19:17.047 --> 01:19:18.818
Fucking Terrance,

01:19:18.818 --> 01:19:20.314
open the fucking door!

01:19:35.868 --> 01:19:40.136
Holy shit.
It’s so fucking real.

01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:48.375
Hen?

01:19:48.375 --> 01:19:50.410
I’m sorry.

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:51.950
Hen?

01:19:52.951 --> 01:19:55.250
I know you’re confused.

01:20:06.393 --> 01:20:12.839
Oh, no. Oh, no...

01:20:12.839 --> 01:20:16.205
I know how you must be feeling,
but I need you to stay calm.

01:20:16.205 --> 01:20:18.779
Ohh...

01:20:22.475 --> 01:20:25.148
I’m sorry
we had to deceive you,

01:20:25.148 --> 01:20:26.787
but it was the only way

01:20:26.787 --> 01:20:30.087
to test your full capacity
and function.

01:20:30.087 --> 01:20:32.188
It’s critical that
you were lucid enough

01:20:32.188 --> 01:20:34.993
to experience the reversal
face-to-face.

01:20:37.193 --> 01:20:40.196
This is
not the replacement, Junior.

01:20:41.329 --> 01:20:44.838
It’s you.
You’re the replacement.

01:20:44.838 --> 01:20:48.105
Oh! No.

01:20:48.105 --> 01:20:50.503
This...
- No...

01:20:50.503 --> 01:20:53.077
This is Hen’s real husband, OK?

01:20:53.077 --> 01:20:56.916
No.
No, no, no, that’s bullshit!

01:20:56.916 --> 01:20:59.446
- Terrance, where is she?
- She’s safe in the house.

01:20:59.446 --> 01:21:01.921
Where is she? Hen? Hen!

01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:05.386
Please! Hen, don’t listen
to ’em, OK?

01:21:05.386 --> 01:21:08.290
What... I’m not gonna let them
do anything to you, OK?

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:10.259
I’m not going anywhere, baby.

01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:20.269
The same day Junior left
to live on the installation.

01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:29.047
When our headlights
turned you on...

01:21:32.314 --> 01:21:34.217
...that was the beginning.

01:21:36.285 --> 01:21:38.254
That was the day
your mission started.

01:21:46.262 --> 01:21:51.938
You were free to experience
a real, human relationship.

01:21:55.073 --> 01:21:58.109
We wanted your
focus to be your present-tense,

01:21:58.109 --> 01:22:00.012
but we had to design
your memory.

01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:01.541
You’re a fucking liar.

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:04.511
We gave that to you
after spending many months

01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:07.580
talking with Junior
before he left.

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.858
Hen!

01:22:10.858 --> 01:22:13.058
I need to know you’re OK.

01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:16.193
I need you here.
I need to hear your voice.

01:22:16.193 --> 01:22:17.898
Hen!

01:22:17.898 --> 01:22:20.131
Hen?

01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.463
Your memories are his.

01:22:38.347 --> 01:22:39.986
Oh.

01:22:39.986 --> 01:22:41.614
It’s OK.

01:22:41.614 --> 01:22:45.453
It’s OK, it’s OK.
I’m here. I’m here.

01:22:45.453 --> 01:22:49.028
Baby. Baby.
Terrance is wrong, OK?

01:22:49.028 --> 01:22:50.458
Whatever this is,

01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:53.230
whatever you’ve done,
it doesn’t matter, OK?

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.100
Why?

01:22:57.036 --> 01:22:58.565
I’m sorry.
No.

01:22:58.565 --> 01:23:01.238
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

01:23:01.238 --> 01:23:03.405
Sorry.
I’m so sorry.

01:23:03.405 --> 01:23:05.374
I am sorry.

01:23:05.374 --> 01:23:07.211
I love you.

01:23:08.344 --> 01:23:10.379
I love you.
I love you too.

01:23:10.379 --> 01:23:14.218
You have to go.
- It’s OK.

01:23:14.218 --> 01:23:16.286
I love you.
No...

01:23:16.286 --> 01:23:19.058
You have to go, baby.
- No...

01:23:21.654 --> 01:23:25.064
Don’t. Don’t do this.
Please don’t do this.

01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:30.102
- No!
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:23:30.102 --> 01:23:32.203
No! No, get the fuck off of me!

01:23:32.203 --> 01:23:35.305
No, no, baby, please!
- No!

01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:36.944
Please! Hen!

01:23:36.944 --> 01:23:39.441
Baby! Baby, please!

01:23:39.441 --> 01:23:45.249
Shame on you! Shame on you!

01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:48.516
You’re going to hell! Fuck you!

01:23:48.516 --> 01:23:50.584
Hen, no!

01:23:52.685 --> 01:23:55.391
This can never
be forgiven!

01:23:57.195 --> 01:24:00.066
Get off of me!

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:04.301
Get off of me!

01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:05.599
No!

01:24:47.113 --> 01:24:49.610
No. No!

01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:53.647
No! Get off of me!

01:25:16.703 --> 01:25:20.377
There were other possibilities
for how this part might go.

01:25:20.377 --> 01:25:24.117
We set out to create consciousness.

01:25:24.117 --> 01:25:29.353
To validate it
through real human connection.

01:25:29.353 --> 01:25:31.520
But we never dreamed Hen
would experience love.

01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:43.268
Junior.

01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:47.206
Hen had no idea
how this would end.

01:25:48.306 --> 01:25:50.539
I never told her.

01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:53.410
You’re not real.

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.479
But what you have both
shown us here tonight...

01:25:56.479 --> 01:25:58.844
is a gift to humanity.

01:25:58.844 --> 01:26:01.583
This is my life.

01:26:04.586 --> 01:26:07.721
This is our life.

01:26:11.329 --> 01:26:14.431
They’re going to be
writing about you for years.

01:26:21.339 --> 01:26:22.802
Hen.

01:26:32.581 --> 01:26:34.286
Hi.

01:26:45.693 --> 01:26:48.234
We’ll go somewhere else.

01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:57.705
I’m sorry.

01:27:52.298 --> 01:27:53.761
Thank you.

01:28:12.318 --> 01:28:14.716
No, I’m fine.

01:28:17.257 --> 01:28:20.788
Oh, fuck this gravity shit.

01:30:44.569 --> 01:30:46.032
Why?

01:30:48.969 --> 01:30:54.975
I was, oh, hoping for loyalty.

01:30:54.975 --> 01:30:56.614
Trust.

01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.485
How can you say that?

01:30:59.485 --> 01:31:01.718
’Cause you’re my fucking wife.

01:31:01.718 --> 01:31:03.885
There were rules. We agreed.

01:31:03.885 --> 01:31:05.722
It’s not like that.
- OK.

01:31:05.722 --> 01:31:08.153
Then, explain.
What is it like?

01:31:08.153 --> 01:31:10.397
This wasn’t an affair.

01:31:13.763 --> 01:31:16.799
I saw you in him.

01:31:17.899 --> 01:31:20.066
You saw me in it?

01:31:21.067 --> 01:31:23.509
I saw what we’ve lost.

01:31:27.777 --> 01:31:30.846
It’s you
that I fell in love with again.

01:31:30.846 --> 01:31:35.653
It wasn’t me, Hen.
It wasn’t real.

01:31:35.653 --> 01:31:37.622
What I’m feeling is real.

01:31:37.622 --> 01:31:40.988
I know what’s real
and what we need.

01:31:40.988 --> 01:31:44.596
And what is that?

01:31:44.596 --> 01:31:47.467
Is that to take each other
for granted?

01:31:47.467 --> 01:31:48.534
No?

01:31:48.534 --> 01:31:50.030
No.

01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:52.571
Is that to just stay like this?

01:31:52.571 --> 01:31:55.442
To just stand still? For what?

01:31:57.444 --> 01:31:59.776
We had dreams together, remember?

01:31:59.776 --> 01:32:02.108
We can just leave and
we can just get out of here.

01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:04.583
- We can do something together.
- My family is buried

01:32:04.583 --> 01:32:06.783
out there
in the fucking ground!

01:32:06.783 --> 01:32:11.018
I can’t throw it all away to
go off on some fucking wander

01:32:11.018 --> 01:32:14.153
that proves nothing.

01:32:14.153 --> 01:32:19.862
This farm, this house,
this life, it’s us, Hen.

01:32:19.862 --> 01:32:22.799
We made it. We should
be fucking proud.

01:32:26.066 --> 01:32:28.838
There is nothing out there
for you.

01:32:32.809 --> 01:32:34.943
I know that now.
There’s nothing.

01:32:39.585 --> 01:32:40.949
Ah...

01:33:14.279 --> 01:33:15.753
Junior.

01:33:31.637 --> 01:33:32.869
Junior!

01:33:35.872 --> 01:33:37.302
Junior!

01:33:38.908 --> 01:33:41.680
Oh, my God!

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.144
Oh, it’s so beautiful!

01:33:44.144 --> 01:33:46.311
It’s so beautiful!

01:33:46.311 --> 01:33:48.852
Junior, come on!

01:33:48.852 --> 01:33:51.756
- Look!

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:53.791
Junior.

01:33:53.791 --> 01:33:55.628
Come on!

01:33:55.628 --> 01:33:56.728
Come on.

01:33:56.728 --> 01:33:58.598
Hey, come on.
- Alright.

01:33:59.698 --> 01:34:02.932
Come on. Oh! Oh, shit!

01:34:02.932 --> 01:34:04.637
- You OK?

01:34:04.637 --> 01:34:06.837
Oh! I’m sorry.

01:34:08.102 --> 01:34:10.577
I’m sorry.

01:34:13.041 --> 01:34:15.142
Come on.
I’ll help you up. Come on.

01:34:15.142 --> 01:34:17.309
No, no, no.
I don’t need your help!

01:34:31.059 --> 01:34:32.797
Look at you.
