That day,

"shaky" doesn't come close

10:20.679 --> 10:23.261
I need to tell you something
about the reverend.

10:24.428 --> 10:25.970
Four years ago,

10:25.970 --> 10:27.679
the church took a trip
to Haiti

10:27.679 --> 10:31.637
to distribute food and medicine
after the hurricane.

10:31.637 --> 10:34.136
Our group went to the beach
one day after helping out,

10:34.136 --> 10:38.762
and the reverend made
some comments about my swimsuit.

10:40.136 --> 10:41.553
I thought the comments
were weird,

10:41.553 --> 10:43.512
but I brushed them off.

10:43.512 --> 10:47.804
I was up for
the AFC scholarship.

10:47.804 --> 10:50.011
Then, later at the hotel,

10:50.011 --> 10:53.595
he said he wished
he had a camera,

10:53.595 --> 10:56.303
so he could enjoy my figure
a little longer.

10:58.637 --> 11:00.970
Did he actually
ask you for photos?

11:00.970 --> 11:04.178
He said that I should take
the initiative,

11:04.178 --> 11:07.220
that then he'd know
how serious I was

11:07.220 --> 11:08.512
about my future.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.220
You didn't photograph yourself?

11:13.220 --> 11:15.011
Of course not.

11:15.011 --> 11:18.178
You know how creepy
that is from my reverend?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.512
Then there's no evidence.

11:21.053 --> 11:23.387
-Witnesses?
-Witnesses?

11:25.428 --> 11:27.303
I'm telling you
this happened.

11:27.303 --> 11:30.136
Haiti was four years ago.

11:30.136 --> 11:31.762
-Should that matter?
-No.

11:31.762 --> 11:34.595
But that's how the law works.
Timing matters.

11:34.595 --> 11:37.053
So, what do you want
to do now?

11:37.053 --> 11:37.970

11:41.595 --> 11:43.387
I don't want money.

11:43.387 --> 11:45.220
But you wouldn't
mind some?

11:48.762 --> 11:49.804

11:49.804 --> 11:50.887

11:52.220 --> 11:54.512
Kayla, wait.

11:54.512 --> 11:57.428
-You don't believe me, do you?
-I'm not saying that.

11:57.428 --> 11:59.595
But why did you remain a member
of the congregation

11:59.595 --> 12:00.845
if he makes you
uncomfortable?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.178
So I should just run away?
They're my people.

12:03.178 --> 12:04.845
They won't be.

12:04.845 --> 12:07.428
If you do this, every single
member of that congregation

12:07.428 --> 12:08.595
will turn their back
on you.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.095
Your people,

12:10.095 --> 12:12.136
the ones you attend
Bible study with,

12:12.136 --> 12:14.387
who smile and chat you up
at church cookouts,

12:14.387 --> 12:16.428
they will drag your name
through the streets,

12:16.428 --> 12:18.220
and you'll be sitting at home,
alone,

12:18.220 --> 12:20.845
wondering why you waited
four years to come forward,

12:20.845 --> 12:23.387
and trying to figure out
if what happened--

12:23.387 --> 12:25.762
What you recall
actually went down that way.

12:28.345 --> 12:29.929
And what would you do

12:29.929 --> 12:33.595
if the reverend tells you
to take the initiative?

I'm telling you.

13:43.679 --> 13:46.178
If you don't talk,
there's nothing he can do.

13:46.178 --> 13:48.136
No, well, there's contempt.

13:48.136 --> 13:50.345
They can hold us
till the grand jury is over.

13:50.345 --> 13:52.011
-How long is that?
-It don't matter.

13:52.011 --> 13:54.512
You go in there,
you answer a few easy questions.

13:54.512 --> 13:56.845
You say you forgot the rest.

13:56.845 --> 13:58.595
Like Nixon.

13:58.595 --> 13:59.720
Yeah, look what happened
to him.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.679
He was pardoned, right?

14:01.679 --> 14:03.387
Now, if they had dug up
enough about Kinicki,

14:03.387 --> 14:04.845
we'd be charged already.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.804
They're looking
for something else.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.178
What the fuck
are they after?

14:09.178 --> 14:10.637
Calm down.

14:10.637 --> 14:12.136
Shit comes with what we do.

14:13.804 --> 14:15.387
It's going to be
all right, dude.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.512
[Frankie]
Sheik...

14:16.512 --> 14:18.053
[sniffs]

14:18.053 --> 14:20.053
...none of this.

14:21.512 --> 14:22.637
How's Christie?

14:22.637 --> 14:23.929
She's all right.

14:23.929 --> 14:24.887
How are the kids?

14:28.887 --> 14:31.261
You're not worried
about me talking, are you?

14:31.261 --> 14:33.553
You? No.

14:33.553 --> 14:34.887
Him?

14:37.095 --> 14:38.970
I don't know, maybe.

14:40.929 --> 14:42.595
[Dermot]
Let's go, let's go. Nice.

14:42.595 --> 14:44.845
Knees up. Yeah.

14:44.845 --> 14:46.512
Let's see it.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.762
Love it.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.512
Let's go, let's go. let's go.

14:49.512 --> 14:52.095
Yes, one-two.
Find the space.

14:52.095 --> 14:54.345
Right knee over the ball.
Use your laces for the par.

14:54.345 --> 14:55.595
Go!

14:55.595 --> 14:56.887
Brilliant!

14:58.929 --> 15:00.470
-I can come back.
-Oh, no, nonsense.

15:00.470 --> 15:02.470
James is the real coach.

15:02.470 --> 15:05.303
I just offer advice,
whether needed or not.

15:05.303 --> 15:07.553
I actually need some.

15:09.428 --> 15:11.553
All right.
Come with me.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.095
It's beautiful here.

15:15.095 --> 15:17.637
Yeah, a stroll's a fine way
to clear the mind.

15:17.637 --> 15:19.261
Don't you agree, Mrs. Rohr?

15:19.261 --> 15:20.970
Please, Father,
call me Jenny.

15:20.970 --> 15:23.303
Well, you call me Dermot, then.
Seems only fair.

15:23.303 --> 15:24.804
"Deer-mut?"

15:24.804 --> 15:26.679
-[laughs]
-[exhales]

15:26.679 --> 15:29.720
Well you got a bit of an accent
there, but you're close enough.

15:31.303 --> 15:34.470
So, what dazzling wisdom
can I impart you?

15:34.470 --> 15:36.220
I, uh...

15:36.220 --> 15:39.136
I don't know if I'm doing
what I'm meant to be doing.

15:40.553 --> 15:41.970
Let's have a seat.

15:44.553 --> 15:46.804
You mean going back to school
for your teaching degree.

15:46.804 --> 15:48.470
Yeah. I mean...

15:48.470 --> 15:50.887
do you ever feel like
your whole life

15:50.887 --> 15:53.011
revolves around
one choice?

15:53.011 --> 15:55.970
I wasn't born
a priest, Jenny.

15:55.970 --> 15:58.679
Ya' know, when I told my mates
that I aim to take the vow,

15:58.679 --> 15:59.970
they thought I'd gone mad.

16:01.804 --> 16:03.637
Do you feel like
you missed out

16:03.637 --> 16:05.136
on something better?

16:07.136 --> 16:09.136
Yeah, now and again.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.303
You know, when I see new couples
at a baptism

16:11.303 --> 16:13.178
holding their baby.

16:13.178 --> 16:17.387
Yeah, I want that...
that connection.

16:17.387 --> 16:19.512
So...

16:19.512 --> 16:22.178
you regret
becoming a priest?

16:22.178 --> 16:24.470
Oh, no, no.
I made my choice.

16:24.470 --> 16:27.970
There's a million and two ways
my life could have turned out.

16:27.970 --> 16:30.095
But God only lets us
live the one.

16:30.095 --> 16:34.011
Our job is to find
the value in that life.

16:34.011 --> 16:35.679
Hmm.

16:35.679 --> 16:39.178
Yeah, I think I let too many
things get chosen for me.

16:40.512 --> 16:43.303
What do you want, Jenny?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.762
[sighs]

16:44.762 --> 16:47.136
I want my family to care...

16:48.512 --> 16:49.470
about me.

16:51.345 --> 16:54.178
My daughter used to, you know,
never want to let go of my hand,

16:54.178 --> 16:57.387
and now she, uh...
she barely talks to me.

16:57.387 --> 16:59.470
That doesn't mean
she doesn't love you.

16:59.470 --> 17:01.220
Yeah, I know.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.220
But she's spiteful.

17:05.595 --> 17:06.679
Like her father.

17:08.178 --> 17:09.470
And he drinks.

17:11.637 --> 17:12.762
She doesn't come home.

17:12.762 --> 17:15.011
I-I don't know who she's with,

17:15.011 --> 17:16.679
what's she's doing.

17:16.679 --> 17:17.887
I...

17:19.387 --> 17:21.845
I don't know how
to talk to her.

17:21.845 --> 17:23.720
How am I going to be
a good teacher?

17:23.720 --> 17:26.220
I can't even reach
my own daughter.

17:28.970 --> 17:31.136
I've been thinking
since we last talked.

17:31.136 --> 17:32.720
How would you feel
about volunteering here?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.595
At the school?

17:35.595 --> 17:38.303
Doing what?

17:38.303 --> 17:40.053
Well, the teachers are
understaffed and overworked.

17:40.053 --> 17:41.512
They could use
your help.

17:41.512 --> 17:43.428
Mr. Holbrook comes to mind.

17:43.428 --> 17:46.220
He's a bit, well, dull.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.428
But you'll interact
with children.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.053
Maybe figure out
a thing or two

17:51.053 --> 17:52.887
about how to deal
with your daughter.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.261
Jackie already thinks

17:56.261 --> 17:57.845
I'm spending way too much time
away from home.

17:57.845 --> 18:00.762
Jenny, be brave.

18:02.095 --> 18:03.387
Be yourself.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.136
Be who God
made you to be.

18:05.136 --> 18:08.428
And then the rest of your life,
well, I mean,

18:08.428 --> 18:10.428
it may not miraculously
fall into place,

18:10.428 --> 18:14.261
but you'll be able to withstand
whatever comes.

18:20.345 --> 18:22.303
[no audio]

18:24.970 --> 18:27.303
[Tommy]
Fucking motherfucker.

18:30.804 --> 18:32.845
-Hey!
-[Jimmy] Hey, Tommy.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.220
[Tommy] Where you been?
We've been looking for you.

18:35.220 --> 18:37.095
[grunts]

18:47.804 --> 18:49.136
[gasps]
Fuck.

18:52.011 --> 18:53.387
Got somethin' for you.

18:59.512 --> 19:01.512
[exhales]

19:01.512 --> 19:02.428
Wow.

19:05.929 --> 19:08.011
You just disappeared?

19:08.011 --> 19:09.804
I got fucking laid.

19:09.804 --> 19:11.303
Good for you.

19:11.303 --> 19:12.762
What's her name?

19:12.762 --> 19:14.845
-Huh?
-Claire.

19:14.845 --> 19:17.261
Claire. What's she look like?

19:17.261 --> 19:19.136
Like a mulatto version
of Cindy fucking Crawford.

19:19.136 --> 19:21.970
She had this red one-piece,
and-- Whoa, fuck.

19:21.970 --> 19:23.387
And we went down to the cape.

19:23.387 --> 19:26.011
They got these really cheap
hotels this time of year.

19:26.011 --> 19:28.053
Where the fuck
did you get the bread?

19:28.053 --> 19:30.178
Maybe you don't understand this
looking the way you do,

19:30.178 --> 19:32.679
but when you look like me,
you don't fucking pay for it.

19:32.679 --> 19:34.011
That's something
that you'll never know

19:34.011 --> 19:35.053
for the rest of your life.

19:35.053 --> 19:36.595
Hey, with everything going on,

19:36.595 --> 19:38.261
you're not gonna tell anyone
what you're doing,

19:38.261 --> 19:40.178
where you're going
or who you're with? Nothing?

19:40.178 --> 19:41.387
Roll the fucking window down.

19:42.970 --> 19:44.637
Roll the fucking
window down.

19:48.804 --> 19:50.261
I ever hurt you?

19:50.261 --> 19:51.887
-Huh? Either of you?
-You're careless.

19:51.887 --> 19:53.887
You're fucking careless.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.553
Especially when you're not
taking your meds.

19:57.553 --> 19:59.804
Oh, fuck me with the fucking
meds again.

19:59.804 --> 20:03.720
Do you-- Do you think I'm not
trying to get better?

20:03.720 --> 20:06.470
Do you think I fucking enjoy
living like this? Huh?

20:06.470 --> 20:07.887
[Tommy]
Oh, you fucking whine bag.

20:07.887 --> 20:09.428
Shut the fuck up, Tommy!
Shut the fuck up!

20:09.428 --> 20:10.595
[Tommy mocks laughter]

20:10.595 --> 20:12.303
Listen to me.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.887
Nobody cares why you are
the way you are.

20:15.887 --> 20:18.011
You make people nervous.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.011
You make people
too nervous.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.929
I can't protect you
anymore.

20:23.929 --> 20:25.261
Are you hearing me?

20:25.261 --> 20:27.470
Get out of the car.

20:27.470 --> 20:29.387
[car engine starts]

20:34.095 --> 20:37.136
Is there anything else
you want to say?

20:37.136 --> 20:39.261
Maybe why the FBI
was after you?

20:41.095 --> 20:42.845
-The girl was his wife.
-What girl?

20:42.845 --> 20:45.011
Fucking Claire.
She's a G-man's wife.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.345
[laughs]

20:48.637 --> 20:52.178
You're lucky I didn't tell Tommy
about the FBI being after you.

20:52.178 --> 20:54.345
Because I wouldn't
see you again.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.804
[car door slams]

21:05.136 --> 21:06.470
[indistinct chatter]

21:06.470 --> 21:08.136
Mrs. Ryan.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.303
Thank you so much
for coming.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.512
Yeah.

21:11.512 --> 21:13.595
It's a lot of art, huh?

21:13.595 --> 21:16.220
I told my students
to draw something

21:16.220 --> 21:17.887
that reminded them
of home.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.470
Want to see Catherine's?

21:20.470 --> 21:21.762
Yeah, sure.

21:24.136 --> 21:25.387
She draws well.

21:26.929 --> 21:28.637
Yeah.

21:28.637 --> 21:30.303
Please, take a seat.

21:33.095 --> 21:34.303
[clears throat]

21:40.804 --> 21:43.387
Catherine's been
sleeping in class.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.387
Her brother and sister,

21:45.387 --> 21:47.470
they're a little hard
to get to sleep at night,

21:47.470 --> 21:49.512
so I've been letting her
stay up a little late.

21:51.303 --> 21:53.136
She says she's been
having nightmares.

21:53.136 --> 21:54.512
Yeah.

21:54.512 --> 21:56.261
But, I mean, that's--

21:56.261 --> 21:58.053
It's normal, right?
She's a kid.

21:58.053 --> 22:00.428
This may be
a little more serious.

22:00.428 --> 22:02.595
She's afraid to go to bed.

22:02.595 --> 22:04.136
What? You never
went through that?

22:04.136 --> 22:05.345
Sure.

22:05.345 --> 22:07.512
But there was
always a reason.

22:10.011 --> 22:12.303
What am I supposed to do?
Control her dreams?

22:12.303 --> 22:14.053
I mean...

22:14.053 --> 22:15.345
Is there something wrong
at home?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.303
I get it.

22:22.011 --> 22:24.804
This is my fault, right?

22:24.804 --> 22:26.720
No, no, no.
This is my fault.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.720
You people are so quick
to blame the parents, right,

22:29.720 --> 22:31.428
when something
like this happens.

22:31.428 --> 22:33.929
Yet a boy hits her in the face
with a hockey stick,

22:33.929 --> 22:35.970
school doesn't call me
about a damn thing.

22:35.970 --> 22:38.720
I know, that was mishandled.
He's since been reprimanded.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.136
But he didn't just walk up
and strike her.

22:41.136 --> 22:42.762
She agitated him.

22:42.762 --> 22:47.387
Which is why she should go and
talk to our school counselor.

22:49.011 --> 22:50.387
[scoffs]

22:52.970 --> 22:54.512
Listen, Miss Southworth.

22:58.303 --> 23:01.178
My kid is not gonna talk
to some shrink.

23:02.553 --> 23:04.261
You understand?
And not for nothing,

23:04.261 --> 23:06.720
but maybe you should go
have some kids of your own,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.553
and let me raise mine.

23:12.929 --> 23:14.679
[school bell rings]

23:16.762 --> 23:18.428
[kids chattering loudly]

23:23.595 --> 23:25.553
-Bye!
-Bye!

23:25.553 --> 23:27.387
[indistinct chatter]

23:39.970 --> 23:42.595
Hey, Indira,
what's the story?

23:42.595 --> 23:44.387
Where are you guys at?

23:44.387 --> 23:46.929
You trace that
bullet fragment yet?

23:46.929 --> 23:48.929
"Indira"?

23:48.929 --> 23:50.178
"You guys"?

23:50.178 --> 23:51.553
Oh, don't start.

23:53.178 --> 23:55.303
Why are you here
doing single duty, huh?

23:55.303 --> 23:58.053
Oh, you mean,
where's Warren?

23:58.053 --> 23:59.303
Yeah, um...

23:59.303 --> 24:01.345
he likes to play the hero,

24:01.345 --> 24:03.845
but, uh...he gets to go home.

24:03.845 --> 24:06.470
So you got no place
to go, huh?

24:10.428 --> 24:11.720
And here you are.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.136
Maybe I understand.

24:18.553 --> 24:21.053
What happened
to your face?

24:21.053 --> 24:22.929
Ah, I'm just ugly.

24:26.970 --> 24:27.929
Carjacking.

24:29.428 --> 24:32.470
-What, you?
-Yeah. Me.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.178
[laughs]

24:34.178 --> 24:36.929
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:36.929 --> 24:38.011
No, I just...

24:40.178 --> 24:41.804
I don't know.

24:41.804 --> 24:44.178
I didn't see it coming,
that's all, you know?

24:46.804 --> 24:48.428
Yeah, well,,

24:48.428 --> 24:50.845
you know, that's how
life gets you.

24:52.762 --> 24:54.345
You tend to think
that you're the hero

24:54.345 --> 24:56.845
of your own fucking story
until that thing happens,

24:56.845 --> 24:58.512
let's you know that...

24:58.512 --> 25:00.804
there's a whole...

25:00.804 --> 25:02.762
other story going on
that you never even imagined.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.845
Life will constantly find a way
to mock us

25:09.845 --> 25:11.303
for our lack
of imagination.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.970
Lincoln Steffens.

25:14.970 --> 25:16.387
I think so.

25:16.387 --> 25:17.762
It might be Stephen King.

25:17.762 --> 25:18.720
[laughs]

25:23.261 --> 25:24.970
So, what, do you gotta...

25:24.970 --> 25:26.720
finish up here,
or what?

25:27.887 --> 25:29.136
Why?

25:29.136 --> 25:30.679
Places we could go.

25:32.428 --> 25:34.387
You think that's going
to work on me?

25:36.011 --> 25:39.470
I'm not going to be
your minor conquest

25:39.470 --> 25:41.387
because you're
feeling vulnerable.

25:49.512 --> 25:50.804
[clears throat]

26:01.679 --> 26:03.512
[man, on TV] So all
that this videotape shows

26:03.512 --> 26:05.303
is that Rodney King
set the tone

26:05.303 --> 26:07.053
for what happened out there.

26:07.053 --> 26:09.720
-[Decourcy] Every time.
-[Siobhan] Are you surprised?

26:09.720 --> 26:11.428
The people you work with
are no different.

26:11.428 --> 26:13.387
...Mr. King's bizarre behavior.

26:13.387 --> 26:16.220
The BPD is setting Fields up.

26:16.220 --> 26:19.595
A woman came to see me today,
and made some allegations,

26:19.595 --> 26:21.387
claims that four years ago,

26:21.387 --> 26:23.720
Fields asked her
for sexy pictures.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.387
[laughs]
Are you s- Are you seriou--?

26:26.387 --> 26:27.929
Old righteous
Reverend Fields

26:27.929 --> 26:29.345
out there scheming
for the booty pics?

26:29.345 --> 26:30.553
This isn't funny, Decourcy.

26:30.553 --> 26:32.512
They're assassinating
his character.

26:32.512 --> 26:34.011
Let me ask you
something.

26:34.011 --> 26:36.387
Why do you think that the man
can do no wrong?

26:36.387 --> 26:38.095
-Why?
-[scoffs]

26:38.095 --> 26:39.970
A black man calls out
the police on their bullshit,

26:39.970 --> 26:41.970
then all of a sudden tales of
sexual misconduct surface?

26:41.970 --> 26:43.679
-Look, look.
-This is political.

26:43.679 --> 26:45.595
Siobhan, I told you
to be careful.

26:45.595 --> 26:46.970
I told you.

26:46.970 --> 26:48.845
The cops have
nothing criminal on him.

26:48.845 --> 26:50.637
If they did, they'd have buried
him a long time ago,

26:50.637 --> 26:52.303
and you know that.

26:52.303 --> 26:54.345
...What greeted them, however,
was this nightmare,

26:54.345 --> 26:55.887
recorded on home videotape,

26:55.887 --> 26:57.762
that has haunted Los Angeles
and these officers

26:57.762 --> 26:59.053
for over a year.

26:59.053 --> 27:00.637
Difficult to--

27:00.637 --> 27:02.428
Can you talk
to your contacts

27:02.428 --> 27:05.178
and see where this attack
on the reverend is coming from?

27:05.178 --> 27:07.261
Are you-- Hold up.

27:07.261 --> 27:10.553
So I'm Mr. Step and Fetch It
all of a sudden?

27:10.553 --> 27:12.261
I'm out here
doing Fields' bidding?

27:12.261 --> 27:15.178
This is not about him.
This is about me. I'm trying--

27:15.178 --> 27:17.136
Babe, I know you got
a job to do,

27:17.136 --> 27:19.762
which is why I left the church
without saying a word that day.

27:19.762 --> 27:21.387
But understand this, baby.

27:21.387 --> 27:24.428
I ain't doing shit
for that motherfucker.

27:28.929 --> 27:30.387
[both]
With eternal gratitude

27:30.387 --> 27:32.178
and love in our hearts,

27:32.178 --> 27:35.136
we christen thee  Gulliver.

27:35.136 --> 27:37.512

27:42.261 --> 27:43.470
[turns TV off]

27:43.470 --> 27:45.178
[Kick]
Hey, I was watching that.

27:48.261 --> 27:49.845
I saw your teacher today.

27:51.679 --> 27:54.512
She said you told her
about the nightmares.

27:54.512 --> 27:57.011
She asked me why I was
falling asleep in class.

27:57.011 --> 27:58.887
What did you
want me to say?

27:58.887 --> 28:01.220
Check your tone.

28:04.345 --> 28:06.679
Now Miss Southworth wants you
to go and talk

28:06.679 --> 28:08.679
to some headshrinker
at your school.

28:08.679 --> 28:11.011
So?

28:11.011 --> 28:12.720
[laughs]

28:12.720 --> 28:14.720
So you don't want to go and talk
to some stranger, right?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.887
I don't know.

28:20.011 --> 28:21.178
Hon...

28:22.929 --> 28:24.970
you know you got somebody
to talk to.

28:27.720 --> 28:28.887
Me.

28:30.303 --> 28:32.303
You know you can always...

28:32.303 --> 28:33.845
"Always talk to me."

28:37.053 --> 28:38.845
-[turns TV on]
-Hey.

28:40.887 --> 28:41.845
Hey!

28:43.178 --> 28:44.762
Look, Kick,

28:44.762 --> 28:47.428
I know these dreams
are scarin' ya.

28:47.428 --> 28:50.261
But you need to talk to me.

28:50.261 --> 28:52.929
This family comes first.
I'm your mother.

28:52.929 --> 28:54.929
You got to talk to me.
You gotta open up and let me--

28:54.929 --> 28:56.762
Shut up!

28:58.887 --> 29:00.679
-Kick, I'm sorry.
-Don't.

29:00.679 --> 29:01.929
-No, come here. I'm sorry.
-Don't. Don't.

29:03.595 --> 29:05.303
Kick, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean...

29:05.303 --> 29:06.553

29:15.261 --> 29:18.679
What happened to your head?
You fall down drunk?

29:18.679 --> 29:20.929
Oh, my God, Dad...

29:20.929 --> 29:22.303
Black ice.

29:22.303 --> 29:23.970
Outside headquarters.

29:25.887 --> 29:27.303
I was just saying,
I have good news.

29:27.303 --> 29:29.136
I got into a couple of classes
at MCC.

29:31.011 --> 29:34.553
Yeah, my first class
is late in the day on Tuesday.

29:34.553 --> 29:37.303
So you're not going to be home
after school?

29:37.303 --> 29:38.595
See, she's plotting already.

29:40.762 --> 29:44.345
Oh, and Father Doyle says that I
can volunteer at St. Cecilia's.

29:44.345 --> 29:46.470
So I'm going to be
a teacher's aide

29:46.470 --> 29:47.970
a couple days a week.

29:53.136 --> 29:55.804
What's that look for?

29:55.804 --> 29:57.887
Just glad I go
to public school.

30:01.303 --> 30:02.970
[Jackie]
Who burned the ziti?

30:02.970 --> 30:05.303
[mother] Nobody burned the ziti,
for God's sake.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.679
[Jackie, audio fading out]
Oh, yeah?

30:06.679 --> 30:08.637
Tell that to the bottom
of that pan.

30:10.261 --> 30:12.011
[sighs]

30:14.053 --> 30:16.303
You needed that.

30:16.303 --> 30:19.178
-How could you tell?
-[chuckles]

30:19.178 --> 30:20.637
You were on a mission.

30:22.679 --> 30:24.470
It was like the month
we were tryin' for Kick.

30:26.178 --> 30:27.845
[sighs]

30:32.762 --> 30:35.011
Kick's teacher wants her
to go see some...

30:36.679 --> 30:38.845
some fucking
psychotherapist.

30:40.387 --> 30:42.345
I put a stop to it.

30:42.345 --> 30:43.845
Well, I think she should.

30:45.178 --> 30:46.679
I do.

30:49.470 --> 30:53.011
-You think she should?
-Yeah.

30:53.011 --> 30:55.178
She's scared to go to sleep.

30:55.178 --> 30:57.428
Yeah, okay.
And sometimes so am I.

30:57.428 --> 30:59.804
-You're an adult.
-I'm your wife.

30:59.804 --> 31:02.053
Down the hall over there,
those are your kids.

31:02.053 --> 31:03.595
-We're your family.
-Oh, yeah?

31:03.595 --> 31:06.845
Yeah. You think she should
go see some--

31:06.845 --> 31:09.637
Some psychotherapist counselor,
or whatever.

31:09.637 --> 31:10.804
The shit she's going
to say to him,

31:10.804 --> 31:13.720
she should say
in this house.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.220
That's it.

31:15.220 --> 31:19.387
You got a grand jury
asking about fucking Kinicki.

31:19.387 --> 31:21.387
You got three dead guards
somewhere.

31:21.387 --> 31:22.804
Your brother's out there
playing Houdini

31:22.804 --> 31:24.261

-Shh!

31:24.261 --> 31:25.887
Don't tell me to "shh."

31:27.428 --> 31:30.845
Think. This shit adds up,
Frankie.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.595
You tell me something.
What the fuck happens,

31:32.595 --> 31:33.887
you go away for the rest
of your life?

31:33.887 --> 31:35.428
Then what happens
to this family?

31:35.428 --> 31:36.637
Where in all this
is it appropriate

31:36.637 --> 31:38.095
for you to hit
our daughter?

31:39.178 --> 31:40.512
Yeah.

31:40.512 --> 31:42.053
She talks to me.

31:43.929 --> 31:45.595
So help me God,
you lay another finger on her...

31:45.595 --> 31:47.679
And what, Frankie? Huh?

31:47.679 --> 31:49.095
Go ahead, what?

31:51.720 --> 31:53.887
Just don't hit my kids.

What can we do for you,
Decourcy?

32:09.804 --> 32:11.345
My wife's been
asking questions

32:11.345 --> 32:12.804
about who's fucking
with Fields.

32:12.804 --> 32:15.804
The micks in Charlestown
can't scare you,

32:15.804 --> 32:18.762
but the wrath of the almighty
missus can.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.136
Tell her you don't know nothing
about Fields.

32:24.970 --> 32:27.053
Well, what kind
of questions?

32:27.053 --> 32:30.220
This girl is claiming
Fields asked for lewd photos.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.762
Any truth there, or are we just
grasping at straws?

[door opens and closes]

32:46.387 --> 32:47.970
[clears throat]

32:50.845 --> 32:53.011
Why are you so interested
in my wife?

32:56.804 --> 32:58.053
Are you Mr. Rohr?

32:58.053 --> 33:00.887
Oh, so it is
just my wife then.

33:00.887 --> 33:03.053
You didn't ask who.

33:03.053 --> 33:05.512
I said "my wife,"
you said "Mr. Rohr."

33:05.512 --> 33:07.011
So I assume that
it's just my wife

33:07.011 --> 33:08.845
that you're interested in,

33:08.845 --> 33:10.845
not the rest of the wives
that are living in the parish.

No, I'm just standing here
with my dick in my hand,

33:17.428 --> 33:21.136
wondering why are you
so interested in my wife?

33:21.136 --> 33:26.178
What is the fascination
with her to you?

33:27.428 --> 33:28.845
[faucet runs]

33:28.845 --> 33:31.261
She asked for counseling.

33:31.261 --> 33:32.595

33:32.595 --> 33:35.178
Oh, so you pity my wife.

33:47.387 --> 33:49.220
[sighs]

33:50.970 --> 33:52.512
So, do you pity
my wife?

33:54.553 --> 33:56.428
Well, to be honest,

33:56.428 --> 33:59.220
if you treat her like
you're treating me right now,

33:59.220 --> 34:01.637
I can see why she'd need
to look for consolation

34:01.637 --> 34:03.178
in other places.

34:03.178 --> 34:05.595
Do you know that I was
an altar boy once?

34:05.595 --> 34:07.553
Yeah. Me.
Can you imagine that?

34:07.553 --> 34:09.887
I signed up
because of a priest.

34:09.887 --> 34:11.428

34:11.428 --> 34:13.345
Looked like Robert Mitchum
in Night of the Hunter.

34:13.345 --> 34:14.762
Except he never
killed anyone.

34:14.762 --> 34:16.804
I mean, not after
he took the vows.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.011
He was a World War II vet.

34:18.011 --> 34:19.804
Father Thomas,
he was afraid of nothing.

34:19.804 --> 34:22.095
I once saw him knock out
a piece-of-shit dad

34:22.095 --> 34:23.845
that was--
that was beatin' his kid.

34:23.845 --> 34:25.595
[laughs]
I loved that guy.

34:25.595 --> 34:27.428
Taught me about justice.

34:30.553 --> 34:32.720
But then one day,

34:32.720 --> 34:35.595
a rumor starts
that he's putting the wood

34:35.595 --> 34:37.345
to some of the working mothers
in the parish.

34:39.970 --> 34:44.428
Father Thomas,
he could take on anyone.

34:44.428 --> 34:46.387
But not after that.

34:46.387 --> 34:48.845
Not in that neighborhood.
He was gone.

34:49.970 --> 34:52.261
So much for justice.

34:55.428 --> 34:58.720
"The wickedness of the wicked
shall be upon himself."

35:00.136 --> 35:01.887
That's good.

35:01.887 --> 35:04.220
You're preaching
this Sunday, right?

35:05.303 --> 35:07.512
Yes. Why?

35:07.512 --> 35:09.762
Well, there's a very easy
solution to all of this.

35:09.762 --> 35:13.220
You are going to stay
the fuck away from my wife.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.970
Come Sunday,
you're going to get up there

35:15.970 --> 35:18.595
and you're gonna preach
your ass off.

35:18.595 --> 35:21.637
And that collection plate
is going to make you look like

35:21.637 --> 35:24.136

of St. Francis of Assisi.

35:28.553 --> 35:30.637
Do the right thing, Father.

The parish could use
a good guy like you.

the jury before we begin

35:42.095 --> 35:43.261

is done in secret

You promise to tell the truth,
the whole truth

35:49.720 --> 35:51.553
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

So help me God.

35:57.178 --> 35:59.136
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:59.136 --> 36:01.345
you've all been briefed
on the case

36:01.345 --> 36:03.512
regarding the disappearance
of Kelly Kinicki.

36:03.512 --> 36:06.178
Today, you'll be hearing
from a lifelong friend

36:06.178 --> 36:08.679
and known accomplice
of Mr. Kinicki,

36:08.679 --> 36:10.053
Tommy Hayes.

36:10.053 --> 36:11.970
Now, I'm not here
to cast judgment.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.512
That's up to you.

36:13.512 --> 36:15.261
In that spirit,

36:15.261 --> 36:17.512
you can ask any questions
that you think would help you

36:17.512 --> 36:20.095
conclude whether or not
there's cause to indict.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.720
My job is to help you
extract the truth.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.762
And hopefully Mr. Hayes
is here for the same.

36:26.762 --> 36:30.804
Now, what is it you do
to earn a living?

36:30.804 --> 36:32.220
I'm a roofer.

36:32.220 --> 36:33.679
Part time.

36:33.679 --> 36:35.387
You have four kids?

36:35.387 --> 36:37.053
That's right.

36:37.053 --> 36:41.345
And you raise those kids
with no government assistance.

36:41.345 --> 36:44.095
You must not be
from around here.

36:44.095 --> 36:45.970
Snows a lot in Boston.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.595
Old roofs like to collapse.

36:48.595 --> 36:50.470
[jurors chuckle]

36:52.929 --> 36:55.970
When was your last
contracting job?

36:55.970 --> 36:58.220
Two months ago.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.512
Okay. What location?

37:00.512 --> 37:03.136
-Brookline.
-Brookline? Wow.

37:03.136 --> 37:06.512
Two months ago
in Brookline.

37:06.512 --> 37:08.970
So, what have you been doing
in the meantime

37:08.970 --> 37:10.887
to feed these four kids?

37:10.887 --> 37:12.804
I have savings.

37:12.804 --> 37:14.261
From robbing banks?

37:16.053 --> 37:18.303
I did a bank.

37:18.303 --> 37:21.512
Commerce Bank
on Broadway and Southie.

37:21.512 --> 37:23.428
You should have seen
that roof.

37:23.428 --> 37:25.303
It was beat to shit.

37:25.303 --> 37:27.345
[jurors laugh]

37:29.345 --> 37:31.053
Yes.

37:31.053 --> 37:33.428
What does that have to do
with a missing persons case?

37:33.428 --> 37:34.470
[woman] Hmm.

37:34.470 --> 37:36.303
[indistinct chatter]

37:36.303 --> 37:38.261
What's your relation
to Kelly Kinicki?

37:40.887 --> 37:42.220
He was an acquaintance.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.220
An acquaintance.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.845
An acquaintance you were seen
drinking with

37:46.845 --> 37:48.970
the night he disappeared.

37:48.970 --> 37:50.428
We were at the same bar, yeah.

37:50.428 --> 37:53.428
And you said that you saw
Kinicki leaving the bar,

37:53.428 --> 37:55.637
the Ebb Tide,
that night,

37:55.637 --> 37:59.220
and getting into an '88
blue Chevrolet Caprice, correct?

37:59.220 --> 38:01.136
I don't remember.

38:01.136 --> 38:04.553
The initial police report said
you didn't see him outside.

38:04.553 --> 38:08.679
Then you testified under oath
that you witnessed him

38:08.679 --> 38:10.804
getting into a blue Chevrolet.

38:10.804 --> 38:12.178
I mean, a guy drinks
in a bar--

38:12.178 --> 38:14.804
So if you were drunk,
Mr. Hayes,

38:14.804 --> 38:16.261
why then specifically identify

38:16.261 --> 38:18.303
the color and make
of the vehicle?

38:18.303 --> 38:22.428
I guess I was eager
to assist prosecution.

38:22.428 --> 38:24.136
[jurors laugh]

38:26.053 --> 38:28.011
Hayes didn't even flinch.

38:28.011 --> 38:30.178
You're not dealing with the
Dating Game killer, here.

38:30.178 --> 38:32.053
You just got to double down
on this next guy,

38:32.053 --> 38:33.512
the shithead,
Sheehan.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.512
[sniffles]

38:36.303 --> 38:38.887
Connecting a four-year-old
missing persons case

38:38.887 --> 38:40.303
to a recent armored truck
robbery.

38:40.303 --> 38:42.428
Am I giving the jury
too much credit?

38:43.512 --> 38:45.512
Hey, Billy boy. Hey.

38:45.512 --> 38:48.303
I need a trace on a partial
bullet fragment.

38:48.303 --> 38:49.845
Sure, I got nothing
better to do.

38:49.845 --> 38:51.470
Hey, shithead,
are you enjoying

38:51.470 --> 38:53.512
those fucking box seats
I got you at the Garden?

38:53.512 --> 38:55.011
Huh?

38:55.011 --> 38:57.387
He's a Suffolk ADA.
He's good.

38:57.387 --> 38:59.512
U.S. attorney know anything
about this?

38:59.512 --> 39:02.053
Did I ask you to run the trace
for the U.S. attorney,

39:02.053 --> 39:04.136
or did I ask
for a fucking favor?

39:04.136 --> 39:05.428
Come on.

39:13.679 --> 39:15.053
We need to get
those results

39:15.053 --> 39:16.804
before I go at Sheehan.

39:16.804 --> 39:18.345
Not necessarily.

39:18.345 --> 39:20.178
Look, I know
you're out of practice

39:20.178 --> 39:21.970
with this whole
"being bad" thing.

39:21.970 --> 39:24.136
But you keep swinging,
and you're gonna hit something.

39:24.136 --> 39:26.011
What the fuck you mean?
I am bad.

39:26.011 --> 39:27.929
Oh, yeah, Michael Jackson
was more convincing.

39:27.929 --> 39:29.470
Practically had
a conniption fit

39:29.470 --> 39:31.762
walking that tiny little
fragment over here.

39:31.762 --> 39:34.178
Ever heard of something called
a little chain of evidence?

39:34.178 --> 39:35.470
Where do you think the staties

39:35.470 --> 39:37.387
take their ballistics
to be analyzed?

39:37.387 --> 39:38.387
Right here.

39:38.387 --> 39:41.720
I did you
a fucking favor.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.637
Yeah, you're bad.

39:43.637 --> 39:44.720
So bad.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.136
Looking at these maps,

39:50.136 --> 39:52.679
you probably recognize
your neighborhood.

39:52.679 --> 39:55.011
If you're present,
that means you have a passion

39:55.011 --> 39:56.387
and a love
for your neighborhood,

39:56.387 --> 39:57.845
and you want to make
that place better.

39:57.845 --> 39:59.261
Safer.

39:59.261 --> 40:01.220
Maybe you have ideas
how to do this.

40:01.220 --> 40:03.970
Maybe you have influence,

40:03.970 --> 40:05.804
like the fine ministers
we've assembled,

40:05.804 --> 40:08.053
or the prominent lawyers
who have joined our cause.

40:08.053 --> 40:11.136
We ask that you tell the stories
that brought you here.

40:11.136 --> 40:12.595
Many of us have
the same stories.

40:12.595 --> 40:15.845
The same desires
for improvement.

40:15.845 --> 40:18.595
Tonight, we're going to do this
open mic-style.

40:18.595 --> 40:22.679
So if you have something to say,
come forward and be heard.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.553
[door opens]

40:33.428 --> 40:34.804
Well, you all know why
I'm here.

40:36.470 --> 40:38.804
Our city has failed us.

40:38.804 --> 40:43.095
But it doesn't mean
we have to fail ourselves.

40:43.095 --> 40:46.470
Our sons shot up
our church,

40:46.470 --> 40:48.136
and what did we get?

40:48.136 --> 40:52.387
A few white cops who can't tell
victim from victimizer.

40:52.387 --> 40:55.136
They see our sons
as predators.

40:55.136 --> 40:57.970
So, what else are our sons
going to do but act accordingly?

40:57.970 --> 41:02.303
Unless we show them
a better way.

41:05.970 --> 41:07.470
Oh, you got something to say,
young man?

41:09.762 --> 41:12.887
What you gonna show us, Jesus?
And he gonna feed our family?

41:12.887 --> 41:15.512
Why did you come here tonight if
you have nothing to contribute?

41:15.512 --> 41:18.845
Hold on. That's not how
we're going to do this.

41:18.845 --> 41:21.470
What is your name?

41:21.470 --> 41:23.428
Maurice. Mo.

41:23.428 --> 41:25.845
[Siobhan]
Welcome, Mo. The floor is yours.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.929
My brother, what brought you
through those doors tonight?

41:34.428 --> 41:35.720
Tiffany Moore.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.679
[indistinct murmuring]

41:42.178 --> 41:43.720
Four years ago.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.637
Ain't nothing changed.

41:47.387 --> 41:49.136
Y'all remember Tiffany?

41:49.136 --> 41:50.553
[murmurs of assent]

41:50.553 --> 41:53.428
She visits her mom
one weekend

41:53.428 --> 41:54.720
from her grandma's
in the South,

41:54.720 --> 41:56.178
and catches a stray.

41:58.595 --> 42:00.261
One weekend.

42:00.261 --> 42:01.679
Two damn days.

42:05.220 --> 42:07.679
Four years, I've been thinking,
what kind of busted-ass luck

42:07.679 --> 42:09.512
it take for something
like that to happen?

42:13.720 --> 42:16.178
I used to run with them.
I put the word out.

42:17.637 --> 42:19.136
Every day, same time,

42:19.136 --> 42:20.553
we went up to H-Block
and shoot.

42:22.553 --> 42:24.345
Said we was putting them boys
on a schedule.

42:26.220 --> 42:27.387
Every day.

42:28.887 --> 42:29.970
[sighs]

42:31.929 --> 42:33.428
So...

42:33.428 --> 42:35.303
it ain't no fucking luck.

42:37.136 --> 42:39.095
Ain't no fucking luck.

42:39.095 --> 42:41.428
[breathing heavily]

42:41.428 --> 42:44.428
[indistinct chatter]

42:51.095 --> 42:53.387
I remember Tiffany.

42:53.387 --> 42:54.762
Twelve years old.

42:56.595 --> 42:58.929
A child gunned down randomly

42:58.929 --> 43:01.595
is the height
of senseless violence.

43:01.595 --> 43:04.345
No mother should have
to grieve her daughter

43:04.345 --> 43:06.053
for something like that.

43:06.053 --> 43:07.553
[crowd murmurs]

43:40.053 --> 43:41.637
[chair scraping]

43:43.679 --> 43:45.595
-Oh, good morning.
-Why didn't you come find me?

43:45.595 --> 43:48.220
I asked someone
where to find you.

43:48.220 --> 43:49.804
A sweet nun told me
you'd be here.

43:51.178 --> 43:52.804
What? What's the matter?

43:55.303 --> 43:59.428
Just...we haven't had time
to clear you with our insurance.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.345
For a volunteer
teacher's assistant?

44:01.345 --> 44:03.011
I'm not teaching the class.

44:03.011 --> 44:05.679
I'm just, you know,
clapping the erasers.

44:05.679 --> 44:08.345
The Catholic church are very
particular with legal matters,

44:08.345 --> 44:09.679
given the recent rumors.

44:11.053 --> 44:12.261
You understand?

44:16.095 --> 44:17.345
Yeah.

44:19.261 --> 44:20.845
Oh, yeah,
I understand totally.

44:23.095 --> 44:24.679
My husband came to see you.

44:26.178 --> 44:27.679
I beg your pardon?

44:27.679 --> 44:29.136
Did Jackie threaten you?

44:29.136 --> 44:32.428
-I have no notion of--
-Or bribe you? Or both?

44:32.428 --> 44:35.011
Mrs. Rohr, I know
that you're at a crossroads,

44:35.011 --> 44:36.804
and I truly want
to be there for you.

44:36.804 --> 44:38.178
Just give me time.

44:43.929 --> 44:45.387
Real brave, Father.

44:49.053 --> 44:51.178
I've reached out
to the police commissioner.

44:51.178 --> 44:52.679
[scoffs]

44:52.679 --> 44:54.762
You have the trust
of the community.

44:54.762 --> 44:56.553
The police have the power
of the law.

44:56.553 --> 44:58.887
And we can't let our emotions
sink this opportunity.

44:58.887 --> 45:00.470
If the cops take the reins,

45:00.470 --> 45:01.970
it's just going to be
more busted doors,

45:01.970 --> 45:03.679
strip searches and humiliation.

45:03.679 --> 45:05.387
We need equal partnership.

45:05.387 --> 45:07.178
I'm pretty sure
I can get the commissioner

45:07.178 --> 45:10.387
to let us handpick the officers
who we want involved.

45:10.387 --> 45:12.553
Fine.

45:12.553 --> 45:14.553
But only because you're cute
when you argue.

45:17.428 --> 45:19.553
Glad we're in agreement.

45:24.512 --> 45:25.845
Boy, you'd give
Vanessa Williams

45:25.845 --> 45:27.512
a run for her money
in that dress.

45:33.387 --> 45:35.637
Revered, what do you know
about Kayla Wiley?

45:35.637 --> 45:38.679
She's a dedicated member
of the congregation.

45:38.679 --> 45:41.470
She came to speak with me.

45:41.470 --> 45:43.553
-About the coalition?
-No. About you.

45:45.553 --> 45:48.303
She said that you asked her
for some seductive photographs.

45:48.303 --> 45:49.929
-Kayla said this?
-That the two of you

45:49.929 --> 45:52.679
were on a church trip to Haiti,
which I verified.

45:52.679 --> 45:54.595
And that you made some comments
about her swimsuit,

45:54.595 --> 45:57.595
then asked her to take pictures
of herself.

45:59.095 --> 46:00.595
Oh! No.

46:00.595 --> 46:02.929
-What?
-I think I told her

46:02.929 --> 46:05.595
that she should have been
in those Vogue  pictures.

46:05.595 --> 46:08.136
-I'll call a meeting with her.
-No, you shouldn't.

46:08.136 --> 46:09.303
No, I have to make this right.

46:09.303 --> 46:10.595
For the coalition,

46:10.595 --> 46:11.845
for legal reasons,

46:11.845 --> 46:13.970
don't you do
a goddamn thing.

46:15.553 --> 46:17.428
Yeah. No, the tow truck's
on its way.

46:17.428 --> 46:18.428
[clears throat]

46:19.553 --> 46:21.637
Okay. Yeah.

46:21.637 --> 46:23.303
I'll see you soon.

46:23.303 --> 46:24.637
Hey, you got a quarter
I could borrow?

46:24.637 --> 46:26.637
-Piss off, needle dick.
-Fuck you.

46:40.679 --> 46:42.595
You got a fucking problem?

46:49.595 --> 46:51.303
You got something
you want to say?

46:51.303 --> 46:53.345
Jimmy...

46:53.345 --> 46:55.470
you talk a lot.

46:55.470 --> 46:57.011
Like your father.

46:57.011 --> 46:58.929
Ever wonder
why he went quiet?

47:02.178 --> 47:03.553
Just trying to make
a phone call.

47:03.553 --> 47:05.637
Uh-huh, communication
is important.

47:05.637 --> 47:08.178
I have a message
from Jackie.

47:08.178 --> 47:09.929
Value is a funny thing.

47:09.929 --> 47:12.345
One minute, something is worth
a fortune and the next,

47:12.345 --> 47:14.637
the very same thing
is worthless.

47:14.637 --> 47:17.220
You're valuable
to someone...

47:17.220 --> 47:19.011
at the moment.

47:20.387 --> 47:21.679
So you're still breathing.

47:25.553 --> 47:28.470
Just tell Jackie that
I'm going to find out

47:28.470 --> 47:29.887
who murdered those guards.

47:31.303 --> 47:32.512
Okay?

47:34.053 --> 47:36.345
Have a pleasurable evening.

47:43.011 --> 47:45.804
[Dermot] In his darkest hour
Job cried out,

47:45.804 --> 47:48.762
"My kinfolk have failed,

47:48.762 --> 47:51.762
"and my familiar friends
have forgotten me.

47:51.762 --> 47:55.011
"They that dwell in my house
count me for a stranger.

47:57.512 --> 48:00.595
And they whom I loved
are turned against me."

48:00.595 --> 48:05.595
These are the words of a man
in the depths of despair.

48:05.595 --> 48:09.553
Of a person who couldn't
understand what he'd done

48:09.553 --> 48:11.261
to deserve this lot in life.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.929
If we only stop
to look outside

48:22.929 --> 48:24.929
of what is immediately
around us,

48:24.929 --> 48:28.345
as Job eventually does
when he looks to God,

48:28.345 --> 48:32.929
we can escape the fate that
we find ourselves trapped in.

48:34.762 --> 48:37.345
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

48:37.345 --> 48:38.595
Amen.

48:42.095 --> 48:43.595
Mr. Sheehan,

48:43.595 --> 48:46.220
how long have you been
a resident in Charlestown?

48:46.220 --> 48:47.970
All my life.

48:47.970 --> 48:49.595
Hmm.

48:49.595 --> 48:52.887
Forty murders since 1975
in your neighborhood,

48:52.887 --> 48:54.387
only 24 arrests.

48:54.387 --> 48:57.679
That is a miracle
of criminal enterprise.

48:57.679 --> 48:59.804
Like I created murder?

48:59.804 --> 49:02.053
Kelly Kinicki
and Tommy Hayes.

49:02.053 --> 49:03.637
You've known each other
for how long?

49:03.637 --> 49:04.970
Since you were kids?

49:04.970 --> 49:06.679
Uh-huh.

49:06.679 --> 49:08.887
Are you aware
that witness intimidation

49:08.887 --> 49:11.136
is a time-honored
Charlestown tactic

49:11.136 --> 49:13.720
to make problems,
and often people,

49:13.720 --> 49:14.929
disappear.

49:14.929 --> 49:18.178
But intimidation only works

49:18.178 --> 49:20.637
if the violence is real.

49:20.637 --> 49:22.845
Is that why Kelly Kinicki
was murdered?

49:22.845 --> 49:25.053
I don't know if the guy
was murdered.

49:25.053 --> 49:27.178
"The guy?" You mean your friend.
An accomplice.

49:27.178 --> 49:29.804
I mean, you did commit crimes
with him in the past, right?

49:29.804 --> 49:31.512
I was acquitted.

49:31.512 --> 49:33.261
Not on two counts
of vehicle theft.

49:33.261 --> 49:35.512
Kinicki wasn't a part of that.

49:35.512 --> 49:39.553
Can you tell us what crimes
Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Kinicki

49:39.553 --> 49:41.178
took part in together?

what Tommy said?

49:52.679 --> 49:54.679
Do you know what Tommy said,
like, on the stand?

49:54.679 --> 49:56.095
Why are you so nervous
right now?

49:56.095 --> 49:58.553
Because the next step for them
is me.

49:58.553 --> 50:00.095
Or you.

50:00.095 --> 50:01.595
I got nothing
with Kinicki.

50:01.595 --> 50:02.887
-Yeah--
-I'm not in his file.

50:02.887 --> 50:04.512
Kinicki was a rat
and a liar,

50:04.512 --> 50:07.887
and he might have put you
in there to save himself.

50:07.887 --> 50:09.720
I don't want to fuck you up,
okay?

50:09.720 --> 50:11.011

to make a mistake.

Then keep your fucking
mouth shut.

50:13.929 --> 50:16.053
There's nothing in there
to connect you to Tommy?

Oh, okay.

So, have you heard
of a cultural phenomenon

It's a monolithic belief.
