00:02.001 --> 00:03.086
- Good game, buddy.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.754
Now let's wind this up,
grab a healthy snack,

00:04.838 --> 00:06.589
and start our homework
so we can

00:06.673 --> 00:08.508
get to bed at
a reasonable hour.

00:08.591 --> 00:11.636
- BOTH: [laughing]

00:11.720 --> 00:13.430
- You kill me.

00:14.431 --> 00:18.101
- Okay, I'm on the planet,
I'm looking cute and...

00:18.184 --> 00:18.727
I'm dead!

00:18.810 --> 00:22.605
Oh, I get another life!

00:22.689 --> 00:24.107
[laughing]
And there it went.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.608
- That's weird.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.402
Why is Gabby playing
your video game?

00:27.485 --> 00:29.529
- Maybe this is part of that
once-a-month thing

00:29.612 --> 00:32.490
Dad was telling me about.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.034
Her gamer tag is
SweetLips4You?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.161
Gross.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.580
Why couldn't I have
been an only child?

00:38.663 --> 00:41.082
- I'm standing right here.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.753
She's playing with
someone named WaffleKing.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.546
Hey, think that's Molly?

00:46.629 --> 00:48.590
- Hey, babe,
I love your beard.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.716
How do I take
my helmet off?

00:49.799 --> 00:50.800
I wanna make
our characters kiss.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.803
- I don't think
that's Molly.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.805
- Do you know
what this means?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.098
- Gabby has a boyfriend!

00:57.182 --> 00:59.142
- Gee, Steph,
don't sneak up like that.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.978
- Oh, I tried to kiss you,
but I blew your face off.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.646
[tsks]
Sorry.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.647
- Aw, I can't believe
Gabby has a boyfriend.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.442
I am so happy for her.

has a secret boyfriend.

{\an8}She knows she's not
allowed to date

02:20.139 --> 02:22.517
{\an8}until she's 16.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.853
{\an8}I say we sit her down
and calmly ask her

02:24.936 --> 02:26.563
{\an8}who this boy is...

02:26.646 --> 02:30.233
{\an8}while we calmly dangle her phone
over a bucket of bleach.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.278
{\an8}- It's that attitude that made
her hide her boyfriend from you.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.321
{\an8}- You weren't exactly
in the know.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.574
{\an8}- Only because I haven't looked
at her Instagram in a while.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.368
{\an8}Gabby trusts me.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.745
{\an8}Gabby blocked me?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.247
{\an8}How could she do that?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.081
{\an8}- Hi, guys.

02:45.164 --> 02:47.000
{\an8}- Who's WaffleKing?
- Bye, guys.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.879
{\an8}- Not so fast,
young lady.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.255
{\an8}We know the two of you
are going steady.

02:52.338 --> 02:57.594
{\an8}- Charlie, they're dating in
secret, not in 1954.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.679
{\an8}- Are you guys
spying on me?

02:59.762 --> 03:01.472
{\an8}Last time I checked,
this was America.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.725
{\an8}- You were playing
a video game we bought,

03:03.808 --> 03:07.604
{\an8}on a TV we bought,
in a living room we bought.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.398
{\an8}Go ahead,
call your congressman...

03:10.481 --> 03:13.776
{\an8}on the phone we bought
that you used to have.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.279
{\an8}- WaffleKing and I are
following all of your rules.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.281
We've only gone out in
groups of six or more

03:18.364 --> 03:19.866
and I'm always
home by curfew.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.410
- Stop splitting hairs.
You know what you were doing.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.828
- Okay, can we at least
know his real name?

03:23.912 --> 03:27.415
- It isn't
WaffleKing, is it?

03:27.498 --> 03:30.335
- I love you guys,
but my life is private.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.503
My feelings are private.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.797
And my relationship
is private.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.132
- Uh...

03:36.215 --> 03:37.592
relationship?

03:37.675 --> 03:40.470
- Feelings?

03:40.553 --> 03:45.266
- ♪

03:45.350 --> 03:46.684
- [sighs]

03:46.768 --> 03:50.271
It's a good thing Dad had these
old people hammers in the garage

03:50.355 --> 03:53.232
- Move over,
I'm goin' first.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.655
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

03:58.738 --> 04:00.490
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

04:00.573 --> 04:01.991
- Apple smash.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.743
We invented it
for game night tomorrow.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.203
- As game night czar,

04:05.286 --> 04:06.829
I am going to need
a copy of the rules,

04:06.913 --> 04:08.915
a list of the equipment,

04:08.998 --> 04:10.917
and for you two to
get real,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.087
'cause there ain't no
way you're playing that.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.838
- Meanwhile,
clean up this mess.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.589
And get all the seeds.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.466
There's already enough
stuff growing in here.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.260
- Sorry, but we had
to play something.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.179
Gabby's hogging
my video game again.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.473
- Is she playing
with WaffleKing?

04:25.556 --> 04:27.684
- Who did with
the what now?

04:27.767 --> 04:29.018
- Gabby's secret
new boyfriend.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.728
She won't even
tell me his name.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.438
- His name is Noah
and he's not that new.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.107
They've been dating
for two months.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.193
- Two months
and she didn't tell me?

04:37.276 --> 04:39.737
Wait, when did you
find all this out?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.197
- I looked at
her Instagram.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.031
- She let you look
at her Instagram?

04:42.115 --> 04:45.159
- She does when
I steal her phone.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.619
- All right,
tell me everything.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.453
I'll give you
whatever you want.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.913
- Just get Gabby
off my video game.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.207
- That's it?
Done!

04:51.290 --> 04:51.916
- Wait, no, Pony Made a Goal!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.460
- Too late.
- Ah!

04:54.544 --> 04:56.462
I didn't think
it through.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.426
- [object pounding]

05:04.971 --> 05:06.889
- Charlie, what are
you doing?

05:06.973 --> 05:10.018
- I'm nailing Gabby's
window shut.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.519
- Why?

05:11.602 --> 05:12.562
- Because the guy
at the hardware store

05:12.645 --> 05:15.440
got all judgy when
I asked him for razor wire.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.693
- [sighs] Honey, this won't make
Gabby any more open with us,

05:18.776 --> 05:21.696
or able to escape
in a fire.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.905
- This is what you
do as a parent.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.240
You set boundaries.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.117
If your child walks
beyond them,

05:26.200 --> 05:29.579
you fortify
those boundaries.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.913
Now if you'll let me
get back to work,

05:30.997 --> 05:33.458
I have motion sensors
to install.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.794
- You know, how about
put a pin in your crazy,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.088
and try bringing him in,

05:39.172 --> 05:40.089
instead of pushing
her away,

05:40.173 --> 05:41.049
which is what
this is gonna do.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.967
- How are we gonna
bring him in?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.594
We don't even
know his name.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.928
- His name is Noah,

05:46.012 --> 05:47.096
and I think
we should invite him

05:47.180 --> 05:48.639
to our family game night.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.559
- Yeah, no, that
ain't gonna happen.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.728
There's no way I'm
bringing him here,

05:53.811 --> 05:54.729
and having all of you
embarrass me.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.981
- What makes you think
we'll embarrass you?

05:57.065 --> 05:58.357
- All of the neighbors
are outside

05:58.441 --> 06:00.985
watching Dad nail
my window shut.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.905
- [laughing]
Oh, please, there's nobody--

06:03.988 --> 06:04.906
Keep walking that dog,
Mrs. Maharry.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.991
Nothing to see here.

06:07.075 --> 06:07.992
[scoffs]

06:08.076 --> 06:11.287
- Gabby, you can
invite Noah over

06:11.370 --> 06:12.705
or I'll do it, myself.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.623
I've been checking
his Instagram.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.917
I'll just wait for
him by his locker--

06:16.000 --> 06:17.627
number 256.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.504
Or the yogurt place
he likes,

06:19.587 --> 06:20.421
or the park where
he plays soccer.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.674
- Fine, I'll bring
him to game night.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.467
Dad, move the ladder.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.428
I need to jump
out the window.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.184
- Remember, the key
is visualization.

06:33.267 --> 06:37.355
Picture everything
going everywhere.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.607
- I'm seeing it.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.610
And I'm liking it.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.653
- STEPHANIE: All right,
boys, listen up.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.530
Gabby's boyfriend
will be here any minute.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.365
I--Seriously?

06:47.448 --> 06:49.575
I told you no apple smash.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.828
- This is apple smash two--

06:51.911 --> 06:55.331
tomatoes.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.625
- Okay, how do I look?

06:57.708 --> 06:58.167
- You look great.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.045
Noah's blind, right?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.464
- Do me a favor--
be less "you" tonight.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.800
- Aw, don't listen to him.
You look beautiful.

07:05.883 --> 07:06.843
Now come help me
with the game night snacks.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.304
I'm whipping up a little
Parcheesi and crackers.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.764
[laughing]

07:11.848 --> 07:15.810
- That. That is exactly what
we said we weren't doing.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.271
- So no trivial pro-shoot-oh?

07:18.354 --> 07:21.274
[laughing]
- Stephanie!

07:21.357 --> 07:24.360
- Hi. Hi. Hi.

07:24.443 --> 07:27.029
It's game night, people.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.408
I brought the scoreboard,

07:30.491 --> 07:32.201
some extra dice,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.078
and a trophy...

07:34.162 --> 07:35.204
for the winner.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.748
- Mom, this already
has your name engraved on it.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.292
- Why make two trips,

07:39.375 --> 07:40.918
when I already know
how the night's gonna end.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.545
- [doorbell rings]
- I'll get it!

07:42.628 --> 07:43.421
I'll get it! I'll get it!
I'll get it!

07:43.504 --> 07:45.548
Nobody messes up tonight.
I'll get it!

07:49.969 --> 07:52.889
Noah, everybody.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.348
Everybody, Noah.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.643
- Hey. Thanks
for having me.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.437
- I don't have
to put on a tie

07:59.520 --> 08:01.480
for this yahoo, do I?

08:01.564 --> 08:04.525
- Charlie, Noah.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.276
- Good to meet you.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.237
- Sorry about
the yahoo crack.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.072
I was just--
What am I doing?

08:10.156 --> 08:10.907
You're trying to date
my daughter.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.826
You should be
awkward around me.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.661
- Well, I feel awkward
enough for everyone.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.415
So, why don't we all be awkward
together on the couch?

08:19.498 --> 08:22.210
- All right, but game night
is on a tight schedule.

08:22.293 --> 08:26.088
I only blocked off
three minutes for Jibber Jabber.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.382
- So, Noah,
tell us about yourself.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.300
- Starting with
your social security number.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.802
- Ha! Dad's always
making jokes.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.721
From now on he's gonna write 'em
down on his game pad

08:33.804 --> 08:35.222
and then burn them.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.099
- You know, seriously,
what do you like to do

08:37.183 --> 08:38.726
in your spare time?

08:38.808 --> 08:40.186
- I guess I read a lot.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.020
- Why?

08:42.104 --> 08:43.688
- For fun.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.524
- I don't follow.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.443
- You're a junior.

08:47.526 --> 08:48.444
What kind of colleges
are you looking at?

08:48.527 --> 08:51.280
- None. I don't
believe in college.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.283
- I'm sorry--
that it exists?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.285
College isn't Narnia.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.455
- Noah wants to
find himself.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.541
- He's gonna find himself
living in a bus station.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.543
- Dad!

09:03.626 --> 09:05.211
- Since there's a lull
in the conversation,

09:05.294 --> 09:09.632
let's grab those dice
and get it rolling!

09:09.715 --> 09:10.549
- All due respect,
Dr. Phillips,

09:10.633 --> 09:14.053
but Steve Jobs,
John Lennon, Oprah--

09:14.136 --> 09:15.471
they didn't finish college.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.849
- Neither did the guys covering
our windshield with newspaper.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.394
- People, game night.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.270
Who wants to pick
the first game?

09:22.353 --> 09:26.190
- I'm enjoying this one.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.109
- So, Noah, how do
your parents feel about

09:28.192 --> 09:29.777
your plans to have
no plans?

09:29.860 --> 09:32.780
- My parents are trying
to force me into medical school.

09:32.863 --> 09:36.325
- They sound delightful.
Why didn't we invite them over?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.868
- Not everyone wants
to be a doctor, Dad.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.287
- I do!

09:39.370 --> 09:43.582
Or a fireman
or a superhero.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.794
Yeah, I don't wanna
be a doctor.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.088
- I have moral issues
charging sick people

09:49.171 --> 09:50.756
eight hundred bucks
for aspirin.

09:50.840 --> 09:55.052
- Dang! You've been holding
out on me, moneybags.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.763
- I'm more concerned with
treating the sick

09:57.847 --> 09:59.015
than charging them.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.727
- Sure, just as long as
they have insurance, right?

10:02.810 --> 10:06.439
- Oh, ho, James,
I'm with you.

10:06.522 --> 10:10.067
Yeah! This game
ain't half bad.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.610
Five points
for the WaffleKing.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.033
- If, uh...if
you'll excuse me,

10:17.116 --> 10:19.785
I have to use the little
yahoo's room.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.620
- Uh, through there
and to the left.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.497
Don't look at the family
pictures on the way.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.708
If you see one of
a little girl taking a bath,

10:25.791 --> 10:30.087
that's James.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.256
- So...

10:32.340 --> 10:35.384
How's everybody
liking Noah?

10:40.556 --> 10:42.224
- Five, six, seven.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.226
- Ha, that's my property.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.729
With a hotel,
you owe me $800.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.230
- Wait a minute,
even with a hotel,

10:48.314 --> 10:50.608
It's still only $450.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.109
- We're now serving

10:52.193 --> 10:54.070
a complimentary
continental breakfast.

10:58.699 --> 11:01.911
- Ah, a power company, Noah.
Do you wanna buy it?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.913
- No, thank you,
I don't believe in

11:03.996 --> 11:05.664
the privatization
of public utilities.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.832
- If you don't get
a college degree,

11:06.916 --> 11:09.543
you're gonna wind up
on the public something.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.922
- Dad, we've moved on.
Roll.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.590
- Why would I need
a college degree?

11:14.673 --> 11:15.883
So I can join the rat race

11:15.966 --> 11:17.593
and do the same job
every single day,

11:17.676 --> 11:18.427
and then find myself
pushing 50

11:18.511 --> 11:21.055
and all I have
to show for it

11:21.138 --> 11:22.431
is a roof over
my family's head

11:22.515 --> 11:24.016
and a nice car
in the driveway?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.144
- Yeah, how bougie
is that?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.187
- Or even worse,

11:28.270 --> 11:30.606
what if you're not the fastest
rat in the race?

11:30.689 --> 11:32.233
What if all you do
is flail around

11:32.316 --> 11:34.276
just lurching from
job to job,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.153
hoping to pay off
your student loans?

11:36.237 --> 11:39.281
- Hey, I'm getting
them down.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.616
- Huh?

11:40.699 --> 11:42.451
- Oh, Noah wasn't
talking about you.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.120
- NOAH: Oh. No.
- [laughs] Yeah, I know.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.789
- Now do Grandma Maggie.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.290
- You could.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.836
Or you could walk outta
here with teeth.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.921
- I was just talking
about myself,

11:54.004 --> 11:55.631
and how I wouldn't want
to make any decisions

11:55.714 --> 11:56.382
that I'll regret some--
- Oh, look, timer's up.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.218
New game, new time.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.261
- [clapping hands]
So, we're done!

12:00.344 --> 12:01.220
I win!

12:01.303 --> 12:04.390
Big surprise.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.434
- Now we get to play
something I can win.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.728
- Nothing involving smashing
produce and mallets.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.480
- Nope, Ogres Midnight
Graveyard.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.399
- Oh, I love that game.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.025
- The extra controllers
are upstairs.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.610
- Noah and I will get 'em.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.487
- Not without
a chaperone.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.697
- I'll go with Noah.
- Sure.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.867
- Cool--I can show you
my rock collection,

12:22.950 --> 12:24.493
ooh, and my bug collection.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.037
I just divide it
into "Dead" and "Almost Dead."

12:31.584 --> 12:34.753
I got this frog when we were
on a camping trip.

12:34.837 --> 12:42.344
And I found this bad boy
an hour ago in my shoe.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.556
- You know, when Gabby mentioned
you were into rocks,

12:45.639 --> 12:47.600
I had no idea you were
such a connoisseur.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.852
- Uh, is that a fancy way
of saying dork,

12:49.935 --> 12:53.397
'cause Gabby's friends
never get my rocks.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.857
- Well, I do.
- Really?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.527
- Yeah, I think your
collection is awesome.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.821
In fact...

13:00.905 --> 13:03.324
I thought maybe you
could add this to it.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.158
That's a moon rock.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.618
It came all the way
from space.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.912
- [gasps]
- Is it a keeper?

13:07.995 --> 13:11.207
- Yeah, thank you!

13:11.290 --> 13:13.125
- I'll take that
as a maybe.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.506
- Maggie, if you're
gonna be on my team,

13:18.589 --> 13:20.090
you're gonna have
to fight.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.342
- Charlie, I am
gonna fight.

13:21.425 --> 13:25.137
As soon as I figure out
how to stop walking into walls.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.474
Okay, now I'm just looking
at the ceiling.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.767
- Thanks again for having
me over, Dr. Phillips.

13:29.850 --> 13:33.938
And I apologize for
what I'm about to do.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.148
- Whoa, you just pulled
out his spine!

13:36.232 --> 13:37.483
- Put that back!

13:37.566 --> 13:39.235
- He also stole my heart.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.738
- Don't.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.950
Don't make it lame.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.868
How did you do
that spine thing?

13:47.952 --> 13:50.371
- It's up, down, X, X,
double tap the joystick,

13:50.454 --> 13:52.414
and hold the right trigger.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.085
- I know you didn't just
rip my head off.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.254
- You're like the brother
I never had.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.090
- Dude, I'm still
right here.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.425
- All right,
who wants snacks?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.094
I've got hungry,
hungry chipos.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.931
- [gritting teeth]
I thought we talked about that.

14:09.014 --> 14:09.890
- What? That was
a good one.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.560
- Come on, we're playing
young versus old.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.479
- Get ready to lose,
old people!

14:15.563 --> 14:18.774
- Uh, Steph.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.658
- Pull up
a wheelchair, honey.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.372
- Flashlight.
- [loud beep]

14:33.455 --> 14:36.000
- Aaron, sweetie,
the word is flashlight.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.668
You have to get
your team to guess that

14:37.751 --> 14:39.670
without saying any of
the words on the card, okay?

14:39.753 --> 14:42.798
- Oh, right.

14:42.881 --> 14:43.966
Okay, guys, pay attention

14:44.049 --> 14:45.634
because I'm not allowed
to say...

14:45.718 --> 14:49.221
Mount Rushmore.
- [loud beep]

14:49.305 --> 14:52.683
- Aaron, sweetie, that...
that was the word again.

14:52.766 --> 14:53.851
- Stop distracting the boy.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.103
There's only so much sand
in the timer.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.396
- Oh, and time!

14:57.479 --> 14:59.315
- It's cool.
You'll get it next round.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.317
- He'd better, if he wants
to keep getting

15:01.400 --> 15:02.985
those $12 birthday checks.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.987
- All right, Charlie,
let's show 'em how it's done!

15:05.070 --> 15:06.822
- Ah! Yeah!

15:06.905 --> 15:08.198
- Ready, go!

15:08.282 --> 15:10.200
- Oh, this is where we went
on our honeymoon.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.410
- Italy.

15:11.493 --> 15:15.122
- Oh, sorry,
wrong honeymoon.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.332
Oh, Buckingham Palace.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.500
- England.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.960
- Right, um...

15:20.044 --> 15:22.212
Oh, this is your
favorite dessert.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.673
- Creme Brulé.
- What? Since when?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.508
- Our amazing, romantic
weekend in Vegas.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.177
- We never went to Vegas.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.970
- Oops.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.182
- Time!

15:33.265 --> 15:36.769
- Okay, Noah, we're up.
Let's do this.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.395
[clears throat]

15:38.479 --> 15:40.814
- Okay, uh, your
things in third period.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.858
- Starfish.
- Right.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.360
- Okay, okay.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.736
Uh, you think
Kelsey Goldberg is...

15:45.819 --> 15:47.112
- Bobblehead.
- Yes!

15:47.196 --> 15:48.822
- Um, uh, okay, okay,
I got it.

15:48.906 --> 15:49.573
You always say
she tries too hard.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.701
- Stepmother!
- Yes!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.536
- Um, the time we were
at the mall, the guy--

15:54.620 --> 15:55.996
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

15:56.080 --> 15:56.830
Flip back a card, Noah.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.749
- Steph, it was just
a dumb clue.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.126
Noah, keep going.
- Time!

16:01.210 --> 16:02.878
- You think I try
too hard?

16:02.961 --> 16:04.713
Is that why you've blocked
me on Instagram?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.048
- What's the big deal?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.716
You see me all
the time at home.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.636
- Yeah, I see you, but you
don't tell me anything.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.929
You've had a boyfriend
for two months

16:12.012 --> 16:13.222
and I still wouldn't
know his name,

16:13.305 --> 16:15.474
if James hadn't
stolen your phone.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.768
- James did what now?

16:17.851 --> 16:20.437
- [loud beep]

16:20.521 --> 16:22.564
- Privacy is such a myth.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.066
The government's
looking at everything.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.901
- Not the time, Waffles.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.028
- Gabby, is that how
you talk about me?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.905
- I didn't wanna do this
tonight in the first place.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.116
But you just had to
meet my boyfriend.

16:32.199 --> 16:37.287
- Well, I'm sorry.
I guess I was trying too hard.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.831
So much for game night.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.916
Clearly, I'm
the big loser.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.418
Excuse me.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.378
- Actually, according
to the scoreboard,

16:44.461 --> 16:47.423
Charlie is the big loser.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.090
- [sighs]

16:51.844 --> 16:54.138
- Charlie, I hate what his Noah
kid's done to our Gabby.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.099
I say we kick him out
and send him to college.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.477
We know he won't
be going there.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.937
- Look, I'm not gonna start
wearing a t-shirt

17:02.020 --> 17:03.272
with Noah's face on it.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.816
But, I hear some girls
have brought home much worse.

17:05.898 --> 17:08.861
- Stop talking to my mother.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.820
Anyway, what
happened here?

17:10.904 --> 17:12.740
A couple of days ago, you were
nailing her window shut.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.031
- Well, you saw the two
of them tonight.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.701
Even if we tell them
they can't be together,

17:15.784 --> 17:18.912
they're not gonna
listen to us.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.955
We can't control what
Gabby does at school,

17:21.039 --> 17:24.041
or at Molly's
or "At Molly's."

17:24.126 --> 17:28.964
- We can control how
he fits in your trunk.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.299
- I'll tell you what.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.427
I'll play you for it.
It's still game night.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.138
High card. If I win, we find
a way to make the peace.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.973
If you win,
we do it your way.

17:38.057 --> 17:38.515
Cement shoes.
Roll him up in a rug.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.934
Ladies choice.

17:41.018 --> 17:41.977
- I'll settle for

17:42.060 --> 17:45.689
not letting Gabby see him
any more, okay?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.858
Ha! Ha! Ha! Queen!

17:47.941 --> 17:50.444
Noah is about to go-ah.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.447
- Ah. Uh. Uh. Uh.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.991
Sorry, babe.
Noah stays.

Show me.

such a sore loser.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.538
- No, I wanna see the card.
- I'm not gonna show you.

[laughing]
Oh, no, no.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.835

Two of diamonds!

It's not that I want
Noah gone.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.348
I just want Gabby back.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.308
What happened
to me, Charlie?

18:21.391 --> 18:23.977
I was the "It" parent.
I was the cool parent.

18:24.061 --> 18:24.728
I was the parent where all
the other parents were like,

18:24.812 --> 18:29.650
What? How's she do that?

18:29.733 --> 18:32.319
Now I'm just a...

Gabby and Noah?

watching each other.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.879
They're out on
the porch.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.673

there alone?

I raised you.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.677
I can't raise everybody.

suffering through this.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.809
Gabby, tonight was great.

19:03.892 --> 19:08.105
- But, they...happened.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.315
- I'd trade my family
for yours any day.

19:10.399 --> 19:14.820
Wouldn't even have to trade.
You could just have mine.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.114
- You do realize I'm related to
those crazy people.

19:17.197 --> 19:21.159

you wouldn't be you.

finally asleep.

I don't want them
walking in on us.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.531

19:59.615 --> 20:01.366
We have to be
very quiet.

think of it.
