STUPID TYPE.

LITTLE HELP HERE?

04:50.500 --> 04:51.450
YOU'RE GETTING COCKY, SEE?

05:00.880 --> 05:02.470
[DEACON] YOU STAY OUT
OF MY BUSINESS,

05:02.510 --> 05:03.680
OR YOU'LL WISH YOU'D
NEVER BEEN EXISTED.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.590
WHAT?

05:05.640 --> 05:07.350
24 HOURS MARIE.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.060
I WANT IT BACK
OR THERE'S GOING TO BE
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.680
[MAL] WHAT WAS YOUR
STRATEGY EXACTLY?

05:11.720 --> 05:12.810
I WAS HAVING
A HARD TIME FOLLOWING IT.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.480
JUST SHUT UP, ALL RIGHT?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.270

05:16.310 --> 05:17.400

05:17.440 --> 05:19.900
OH, I'M SO, SO SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:19.940 --> 05:21.610
THAT WAS NOTHING,
I'M FINE.

05:21.650 --> 05:24.320
HE'S FINE.
HIS HEAD ABSORBED
MOST OF THE FALL.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.370
[MARIE] DEACON AND I WERE
TOGETHER FOR A FEW MONTHS,

05:29.410 --> 05:31.370
AND THEN I KICKED HIM OUT.

05:31.410 --> 05:32.540
IT JUST WASN'T WORKING.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.330
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU USED TO GO OUT WITH
THIS BONEHEAD.

05:35.370 --> 05:38.460
I MEAN, HE JUST DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE YOUR TYPE.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.960
I PACKED UP HIS STUFF,
I LOCKED HIM OUT,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.630
AND THEN HE OWES ME
THREE GRAND IN RENT,

05:41.670 --> 05:43.800
SO HE BROUGHT THE CIGARETTE
CASE HOME AND I SOLD IT,

05:43.840 --> 05:45.220
AND NOW HE'S FREAKING OUT.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.260
JAKE-O, I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.430
-HI.

CIGARETTE CASE.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.600
I PROMISE I'LL KEEP DEACON OFF
YOUR BACK WHILE WE DO IT.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.060
[MAL] HARD TO DO IT THAT
FROM YOUR ARSE.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.480
GOT ANOTHER SON, YOU KNOW.
STRONG AS AN OX.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.070
SINGLE TOO.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.570
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.960
-HI, I'M MARIE.
-[MAL] THIS IS CHRISTIAN.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.580
HE OWNS HIS OWN BAR
DOWNSTAIRS.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.500
YES, INDEED I DO.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.840
HALF OWNS IT.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.630
I NEED TO MEET YOU.

06:23.670 --> 06:24.800

WHEN?

06:24.840 --> 06:27.090

06:33.640 --> 06:34.770
JUST GIVE ME A

06:34.810 --> 06:36.060
I'LL BE THERE AS
SOON AS I CAN.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.190
THANK YOU, JAKE.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.270
UH, I WENT THROUGH ALL
THE SECURITY FOOTAGE

06:41.310 --> 06:44.150
AT THE CURIOSITY SHOP,
AND I FOUND THIS.

06:44.190 --> 06:45.690
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS IS
THE RIGHT CIGARETTE CASE?

06:45.740 --> 06:47.610
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
CIGARETTE CASE THAT
THEY SOLD TODAY.

06:47.650 --> 06:48.570
[CHRISTIAN] I ALMOST CUT
YOU OFF.

06:48.610 --> 06:49.660

-PROBABLY.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.790
ANYWAYS,
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GUY?

06:54.830 --> 06:56.910
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY
BE GOING.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.580
HEY, LITTLE BROTHER.
DON'T GET BEAT UP AGAIN.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.510
LOGO'S FROM
MICHELE'S BAKERY.

07:09.550 --> 07:12.850
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
TO MICHELE'S AND SEE IF
HE'S WORKING A SHIFT.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.520
WE CAN DROP YOU OFF
AT HOME ON THE WAY
IF YOU'D LIKE.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.560

THROUGH THAT WINDOW.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.100
-I SLIPPED.
-AND THAT YOU HAVE,
MY SON.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.560

INTO HIS OWN.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.430
THE HAIR, THE BUILD.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.060
HE COULD HAVE HANDLED THAT
DEACON LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.100
YOU KNOW, TURNING SON
AGAINST SON IS BEYOND

08:03.150 --> 08:04.560
HOW LOW I THOUGHT
YOU COULD GO.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.020
DEACON, SHUT UP! IDIOT.

08:06.650 --> 08:07.690
-NO.
-HEY.

TRACK DOWN A CIGARETTE
CASE YOU BOUGHT.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.540
CIGARETTE CASE?
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
A CIGARETTE CASE.

08:23.580 --> 08:28.000
I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU
BUYING A CIGARETTE CASE
EARLIER TODAY.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.800
WE JUST WANNA BUY

08:29.840 --> 08:34.760
-THERE'S NO TROUBLE.
-RIGHT, SORRY.
I FORGOT.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.260

08:45.860 --> 08:47.980
WELL, HE DID HAPPEN TO
LEAVE HIS CELL PHONE BEHIND.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.610
25 CALLS TO DEACON?

08:51.650 --> 08:52.950
THAT'S MARIE'S EX-BOYFRIEND.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.780
MAYBE KELLY WANTED
TO SELL HIM BACK THE CASE.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.620
OW! WHAT THE HELL?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.620
WHAT THE HELL, MAN!

09:02.660 --> 09:03.870
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

09:03.910 --> 09:04.920
GET OUT OF HERE!

09:09.460 --> 09:10.460
WELL, WE GOT THE CASE.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.760
HATE TO SAY IT, BUT, UH...

09:12.800 --> 09:14.090
WHAT? WHAT? CHRISTIAN
WOULD HAVE DONE THAT BETTER?

09:14.130 --> 09:15.260
I GOT THE CASE, DON'T I?

09:16.760 --> 09:20.510
SO WHAT? DEACON GIVES KELLY
THE CASE, MARIE...

09:20.560 --> 09:21.720
OH, WHATEVER. I'M JUST GONNA

09:21.770 --> 09:23.480
GIVE THIS BACK TO MARIE AND
GET IT OVER WITH.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.480
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.810
-WHAT?
-YOU ALMOST GET YOUR HEAD
TAKEN OFF TWICE OVER THIS,

09:27.860 --> 09:29.940
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO HAND IT
BACK TO THAT GIRL

09:29.980 --> 09:32.650
WITH NO IDEA
OF WHAT YOUR LIBIDO HAS
DRAGGED US INTO?

09:32.690 --> 09:33.990
WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH YOU TODAY?

09:34.030 --> 09:35.660
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
I'M TRYING TO PROVE
A POINT HERE.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.410
THAT YOU'RE
A DICK-SMACK?

09:37.450 --> 09:39.700
THIS MORNING,
YOU WOKE UP SOMEWHERE,
GOD KNOWS WHERE,

09:39.740 --> 09:42.790
HUNG OVER AS HELL.
NOW YOU'RE FOLLOWING
SOME GIRL AROUND,

09:42.830 --> 09:45.460
GETTING THE CRAP BEAT OUT
OF YOU EVERY TWO MINUTES.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.500
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'RE REGRESSING.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.500
AND THE PLACE YOU'RE
REGRESSING FROM WAS
NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF.

09:52.210 --> 09:53.800
THAT'S A HELL
OF A PEP TALK.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.920
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

09:55.630 --> 09:57.390
MAL, I NEED YOU HOME.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.470
NOW.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.350
OKAY. I GOTTA GO.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.640
-HOW'RE YOU
GONNA GET HOME?
-NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

10:06.690 --> 10:08.730
[MAL] WELL, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S
BEEN A MISTAKE AT THEIR END.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.230
THE PRINCIPAL SAYS THAT
THEY'VE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE
CHECKED.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.400
SO LET THEM CHECK AGAIN.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.780
SHE WAS OVER THERE
A FULL SEMESTER.

10:13.820 --> 10:16.110
THE SCHOOL IN LONDON
HAS NO RECORD OF
TINNY WHATSOEVER.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.740
THEY SAY SHE NEVER ENROLLED.

10:17.780 --> 10:20.740
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
OF COURSE I ENROLLED.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.700
HOW'S I SUPPOSED
TO GO TO SCHOOL
IF I NEVER ENROLLED?

10:22.740 --> 10:24.750
I'LL CALL THEM MYSELF.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.830
THE SCHOOL HERE SAYS
SHE MAY HAVE TO REPEAT
THE ENTIRE YEAR.

10:27.870 --> 10:30.420
WHAT? POPPY?

10:30.460 --> 10:32.090
I KNOW, KIDDO.
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.590
LOOK, I'LL NOT LET YOU GET
HELD BACK BECAUSE OF

10:34.630 --> 10:36.010
SOME BUREAUCRATIC FOOLISHNESS.
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

10:36.050 --> 10:37.720
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-NO, IT'S OKAY.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.800
-I'LL CALL MYSELF.
-OKAY, THANK YOU. GOOD.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.600
TINNY, YOU MUST HAVE
SOME RECEIPTS OR
SOMETHING UPSTAIRS.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.930
I GOTTA GO.

10:44.970 --> 10:45.980
&lt;TO PHONE&gt;
I'M ON MY WAY.

10:48.850 --> 10:49.980
&lt;DOOR SHUTTING&gt;

10:51.650 --> 10:52.770
[NIKKI] HI, WHERE ARE YOU?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.190
[JAKE] LOOK, I AM SO SORRY.

10:54.230 --> 10:55.690
I HAD A THING, WHICH,
YOU KNOW,

10:55.730 --> 10:57.950
KIND OF TURNED INTO ANOTHER...

10:57.990 --> 10:59.700
-I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.
-...THING.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.700
JAKE, YOU ALWAYS PULL
THIS WHEN I NEED YOU.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.620
NO, NO, NO, IT'S JUST,
YOU SEE, THAT MY SUPER-HOT

11:05.660 --> 11:07.080
EX-WIFE, SEE SHE REALLY...

11:08.870 --> 11:10.290
-WHAT?
-JERK.

11:10.330 --> 11:13.040
SO? WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'M HERE. WHAT?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.420
OKAY. COME HERE.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.090
I THINK...

11:18.130 --> 11:19.590
I THINK I NEED TO HIRE YOU.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.090
I THINK.
IS THAT CRAZY?

11:21.140 --> 11:22.180
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY, RIGHT?

11:22.220 --> 11:25.140
NIKKI? WHAT'S WRONG?

11:25.180 --> 11:26.430
JUST SOMETHING...

11:27.180 --> 11:28.730
I CAN'T SHAKE IT, JAKE.

11:28.770 --> 11:32.690
I HAVE THIS REALLY BAD FEELING

11:32.730 --> 11:33.900
THAT SOMETHING
ISN'T RIGHT.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.820
IT'S DAVID. I THINK
HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.450
YOU THINK THAT
DAVID'S CHEATING?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.450
NIKKI, DAVID IS NOT
CHEATING ON YOU.

11:41.490 --> 11:42.870
LOOK, LISTEN TO ME.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.740
FIRST OF ALL,
HE'S A DIVORCE ATTORNEY,
HE KNOWS BETTER.

11:45.780 --> 11:49.750
SECOND OF ALL,
HE KNOWS YOU'RE WAY,
WAY TOO HOT FOR HIM.

11:49.790 --> 11:50.920
A COUPLE
OF NIGHTS AGO,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.500
HE SAID HE WAS MEETING
WITH A CLIENT.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.290
THEN I PHONED HIM
AT THE OFFICE
AND HE WASN'T THERE.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.630
AND THERE WERE A COUPLE
OF OTHER THINGS.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.420
NIKKI! STOP!

11:58.460 --> 11:59.590
OKAY?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.140
DO NOT GO DOWN THIS ROAD.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.810
I'M TELLING YOU.
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.720
THERE IS NO TURNING BACK,
SO JUST STOP IT.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.770
OKAY, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.980
DO ME A FAVOR, OKAY?

12:14.020 --> 12:16.610
YOU GO HOME,
YOU LOOK HIM IN THE EYE,

12:16.650 --> 12:17.980
AND YOU SEE FOR YOURSELF.

12:18.690 --> 12:19.900
OKAY.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.450
THANKS.

12:31.660 --> 12:36.000
OKAY, SO THERE WERE 18,743
AUCTION LISTINGS

12:36.040 --> 12:37.250
FOR "CIGARETTE CASE" ONLINE,

12:37.290 --> 12:40.420
AND YET I CAN'T FIND EVEN ONE
HALL AND OATES AUTOGRAPH.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.090
-[ROSE] REALLY?
-[DES] I KNOW,
ESPECIALLY SINCE

12:42.130 --> 12:43.840
THEY'RE THE GREATEST SELLING
DUO OF ALL TIME.

12:43.880 --> 12:44.930
NO, DEAR,
THE CIGARETTE CASES.

12:44.970 --> 12:47.260
OH, RIGHT,
YEAH. OH SORRY.
UH, OKAY, OF COURSE.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.180
SO AFTER ALL THAT,
I HONED IN ON THIS.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.850
DEACON SPENT
A THOUSAND BUCKS ON
THAT CIGARETTE CASE?

12:52.890 --> 12:55.560
DEACON DOESN'T STRIKE ME
AS THE EXPENSIVE ONLINE
COLLECTABLES TYPE.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.900
[DES] NO, NO, HE'S NOT.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.940
IT WAS ACTUALLY BOUGHT BY
A GUY NAMED EDWIN WINTERS.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.030
"DIVORCE BREAK
YOUR HEART?

13:00.070 --> 13:02.110
"BRING US YOUR GOLD RING
FOR A FRESH START".

13:02.150 --> 13:03.530
THAT'S THE GUY!

13:04.950 --> 13:07.240
EDWIN WINTERS IS ONE OF
THOSE GUYS THAT BUYS GOLD.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.200
YEAH, AND JEWELRY.
"GOT DIAMONDS AND PEARLS?

13:09.240 --> 13:10.410
"BRING 'EM TO ED'S
JEWELRY WORLD".

13:12.620 --> 13:16.080
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN EDWIN WINTERS
AND DEACON?

13:16.130 --> 13:17.920
UH, DEACON DOES
HIS YARD WORK.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.750
HE'S BEEN STEALING
FROM HIS BOSS.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.920
-ROSE, YOU GOT AN ADDRESS?
-I CAN GET ONE.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.510
DES, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS CIGARETTE CASE
FOR A SECOND?

13:25.550 --> 13:26.840
OH, COOL.

13:29.470 --> 13:32.100
-WHAT DO YOU GOT?
-I DIDN'T WEAR YOUR
LEATHER JACKET TO THE MALL.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.890
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
TINNY WAS LIVING IN LONDON,
SO DON'T ASK.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.940
NO. THE INFORMATION
ABOUT DAVID?

13:37.980 --> 13:39.020
OH, RIGHT.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.490
HERE YOU GO. BUT, HANG ON.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.610
-PERMISSION TO SPEAK FREELY?
-NO.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.990
IT'S JUST, ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA?

13:48.030 --> 13:49.780
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR EX-WIFE

13:49.830 --> 13:51.160
AND YOUR EX-WIFE'S
NEW HUSBAND.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.830
I MEAN, OKAY, LOOK.

13:52.870 --> 13:55.000
I'VE JUST GOT EXPERIENCE
WITH BEING TORN
BETWEEN TWO LOVERS AND...

13:55.040 --> 13:55.870
OW!

13:55.910 --> 13:57.830
DES, WHEN DID I EVER,

13:57.880 --> 13:59.840
EVER ASK FOR YOUR
PERSONAL INSIGHT.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.710
-WHAT'S IN THE FILE?
-THAT HURTS B'Y.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.550
IT'S ALL THERE.
CRIMINAL CHECK. MEDICAL,
FINANCIAL REPORT.

14:05.590 --> 14:07.220
MAN, HE MAKES A LOT OF MONEY.

14:09.970 --> 14:11.600
I NEED YOU
TO FOLLOW HIM.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.350
AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT
THIS OR I'LL KILL YOU.

14:13.390 --> 14:14.890
OKAY, YOU GOT IT.
I'M ON IT.

14:14.930 --> 14:15.940
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
WHISPERING ABOUT?

14:16.600 --> 14:18.150
NOTHING. DES HAS FLEAS.

14:19.310 --> 14:20.900
UH..."HAD".

14:20.940 --> 14:22.980

14:28.700 --> 14:30.870
[DES] OKAY. SUBJECT, DAVID.

14:30.910 --> 14:32.910

OKAY, OKAY, OH, OH,

14:39.830 --> 14:42.290
SUBJECT HAS TURNED TO PAGE
16 OF THE NEWSPAPER.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.090
-HEY.
-HEY.

14:45.130 --> 14:47.090
IT SMELLS LIKE MANGO
LIP-GLOSS IN HERE.

14:47.130 --> 14:49.930
NO, NO.
THAT'S JUST CARPET
CLEANER STUFF.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.430
DESSIE, HOW TOUGH WOULD IT BE

14:51.470 --> 14:53.470
TO FORGE A BRITISH HIGH
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT?

14:53.510 --> 14:55.020
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT FRAUD RIGHT?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.020
LIKE REAL FRAUD.
NOT THE FUN KIND.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.480
WELL, IF I DO IT MYSELF,
I'LL DEFINITELY GET BUSTED,

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
SO...

15:02.020 --> 15:04.940
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
LIKE, ALL B'S?

15:04.980 --> 15:06.280
MAYBE YOU WANT AN "A" OR TWO?

15:06.320 --> 15:07.360
DON'T GO TOO CRAZY.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.360
MAYBE GIVE ME LIKE A C+
IN HISTORY.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.200
YOU KNOW, MAL AND ROSE
WON'T BE THAT UPSET

15:11.240 --> 15:13.580
IF YOU'VE FLUNKED OUT.
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN
THE LANGUAGE BARRIER.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.000
I DIDN'T FLUNK OUT, DES.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.120
I NEVER ENROLLED.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.460

15:52.910 --> 15:53.950
UNCLE EDDIE.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.370
I FOUND HIM.

15:56.410 --> 15:58.200
I THINK SOMEBODY MURDERED HIM.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.330
EDWIN WINTERS
IS YOUR UNCLE?

16:01.210 --> 16:02.370
YEAH.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.330

16:11.550 --> 16:13.970
POOR BASTARD,

A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

16:15.180 --> 16:16.390
CHECK OUT THIS WEIRD STUFF.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.770
A GOLD SMELTING
ACCIDENT?

16:20.810 --> 16:23.600
NO, THE GET-UP IS FOR
A COMMERCIAL HE WAS
ON HIS WAY TO SHOOT.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.770
IT GETS WEIRDER.

16:24.810 --> 16:26.070
WEIRDER THAN A GUY
IN A GOLD COSTUME?

16:26.770 --> 16:27.900
[LESLIE] HOOD!

16:29.440 --> 16:30.990

16:57.600 --> 16:59.470
PLEASE.
YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.680
I WAS JUST THERE
VISITING MY UNCLE.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.480
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM ALIVE?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.980
I DON'T KNOW. LIKE,
A MONTH AGO. I DON'T KNOW.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.730
ARE YOU SURE IT
WASN'T A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO?

17:08.400 --> 17:09.820
SAY, WHEN YOU KILLED HIM?

17:09.860 --> 17:11.110
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY!

17:13.950 --> 17:15.200
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.290
YOUR BOYFRIEND,
DEACON ROGERS,

17:22.330 --> 17:23.790
HE DID YARD WORK
FOR YOUR UNCLE?

17:23.830 --> 17:25.120
YEAH. HE DID. YEAH.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.000
SO WHERE IS DEACON
ROGERS NOW?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.170
I DON'T KNOW.

17:29.210 --> 17:32.170
THAT CIGARETTE CASE,
YOU HIRED THE DOYLE'S TO FIND,

17:32.210 --> 17:35.720
THAT WAS STOLEN FROM YOUR
UNCLE'S AND YOU SOLD IT JUST
YESTERDAY.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.930
CORRECT?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.850
YOU CAN'T HONESTLY
THINK THAT SHE KILLED
HER UNCLE FOR,

17:45.890 --> 17:47.020
LIKE, A CIGARETTE CASE?

17:47.060 --> 17:48.610
I'M NOT SURE.
THAT'S WHY I'M LETTING HER GO,

17:48.650 --> 17:50.320
SO I CAN CHECK OUT HER ALIBI.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.690
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHERE THAT CIGARETTE
CASE IS, WOULD YA?

17:52.730 --> 17:54.820
ME? NO.
WHY WOULD I KNOW THAT?

17:54.860 --> 17:56.280
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.570
JUST WHAT I THOUGHT.
I WASH YOUR BACK,
YOU WASH YOUR OWN.

17:58.620 --> 17:59.830
SAME OLD, SAME OLD.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.200
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.830
CUT HER LOOSE.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.330
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.790
SHE'S PRETTY, JAKE.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.250
DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.790
IF SHE DID WHAT WE
THINK SHE DID,

18:09.840 --> 18:12.130
SHE'S TOO SICK EVEN FOR YOU.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.420
SICK? LESLIE, WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.630
MARIE? MARIE.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.800
-I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE DOING THIS TO ME.
-MARIE?

18:19.510 --> 18:20.640
DO YOU THINK
DEACON DID IT?

18:20.680 --> 18:22.100
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

18:22.140 --> 18:24.220
LESLIE, SERGEANT BENNETT,

18:24.270 --> 18:25.520
THE OFFICER YOU WERE
JUST TALKING TO,

18:25.560 --> 18:27.690
SHE'S HOLDING SOMETHING
BACK ABOUT YOUR UNCLE'S DEATH.

18:27.730 --> 18:29.060
-I'M JUST...
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

18:29.650 --> 18:31.270
...NOT SURE WHAT.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.610
CAN YOU JUST HOLD ON
FOR ONE SECOND?

18:32.650 --> 18:34.280
WALTER,
WHAT'VE YOU GOT?

18:34.320 --> 18:36.360
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
GETTING ME TO DIG UP
DIRT ON NIKKI'S HUSBAND.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.410
WELL, YOU'RE MY FRIEND
AND MY LAWYER.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.240
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.410
NOTHING!
THE GUY IS AS CLEAN
AS A WHISTLE.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.830
-YOU'RE SURE?
-LOOK, DUDE,

18:46.870 --> 18:51.290
I DO THE ODD DANCE WITH SOME
BORDERLINE MORAL FLEXIBILITY,

18:51.340 --> 18:53.250
WE ALL GOT SOME VICES, RIGHT?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.210
DAVID? NOTHING.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.220
OKAY,
WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

18:57.260 --> 19:00.340
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.890
I THINK YOU AND
I SHOULD TALK.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.350
I JUST WANNA
GO HOME, JAKE.

19:05.390 --> 19:07.270
PLEASE, CAN I JUST GO HOME
AND FORGET ABOUT THIS?

19:10.400 --> 19:13.570
CIGARETTE CASE HAS
A LITTLE COMPARTMENT
THING IN HERE,

19:13.610 --> 19:16.900
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THIS
WHOLE THING IS ABOUT
WHAT WAS INSIDE.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.320
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT IS,
WOULD YOU?

19:20.700 --> 19:23.160
DON'T LIE TO ME, MARIE.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.240
WHAT WAS INSIDE THE CASE?

19:35.590 --> 19:37.670
SO IS THIS WHAT
ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT?

19:38.050 --> 19:39.090
YUP.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.680
IT'S JUST THAT DEACON
WAS BEING SO UNREASONABLE,

19:42.720 --> 19:46.640
AND I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
GROCERIES, AND HE OWES ME
A LOT OF MONEY.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.180
UM, I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU TOLD ME THE
WHOLE STORY. COME ON.

19:52.520 --> 19:55.400
[DES] SO WE'RE DOING SOME
PRETTY HIGH TECH
SURVEILLANCE, HERE.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.610
TRACKING SOME PRETTY
DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.

19:58.650 --> 20:01.660
IT'S NO BIGGIE, RIGHT?
JUST A DAY IN THE LIFE, RIGHT?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.950
WOW, WHAT A BIG MAN YOU ARE.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.280
JAKE REALLY
BELIEVES IN ME.

20:06.450 --> 20:07.830
OKAY, WELL,

20:07.870 --> 20:09.120
YOU LET ME KNOW WHEN
YOU GET OFF WORK.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.830
WELL, I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN THE JOB IS DONE.
BECAUSE,

20:11.870 --> 20:14.460
-I'M A MAN AT MY WORK.
-&lt;DOORS OPENING&gt;

20:14.500 --> 20:17.420
HEY, TINNY. HI TINNY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

20:17.460 --> 20:19.130
OH, SO YOU'RE TINNY?

20:20.170 --> 20:23.050
-I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.
-REALLY?

20:23.090 --> 20:24.800
I NEVER HEARD A
THING ABOUT YOU.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.430
WHO IS THIS, DES?

20:26.470 --> 20:29.310
THIS IS CHANDRA,
AND CHANDRA THIS IS...

20:29.350 --> 20:30.310
YOU'RE DES' ASSISTANT, RIGHT?

20:30.350 --> 20:32.020
-NO.
-YES B'Y.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.400
TINNY'S MY, UM...

20:33.770 --> 20:35.440
SHE'S LIKE MY...

20:35.480 --> 20:37.190
OH, MY GOD!
SHE'S LIKE A WORK,

20:37.230 --> 20:38.820
OFFICIALLY, A COLLEAGUE,
LIKE A FRIEND THROUGH WORK.

20:39.860 --> 20:41.070
-YEAH.
-WELL, I'LL LET

20:41.110 --> 20:43.240
YOU GET BACK TO THE FRONT
LINES HERE.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.320
-OKAY.
-OKAY?

20:44.360 --> 20:45.320
YEAH.

20:45.950 --> 20:47.910
YES.

20:47.950 --> 20:50.370
OH, AND IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU, TINNY.

20:50.870 --> 20:52.000
SEE YA.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.290
&lt;DOORS CLOSE&gt;

20:58.550 --> 21:01.470
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
THE MANGO LIP GLOSS SMELL.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.010
I'M JUST DOING SOME
SURVEILLANCE HERE, SO I...

21:05.590 --> 21:07.640
YOU'VE GOT ME ALL ALONE
IN THE BACK OF A VAN

21:07.680 --> 21:10.350
AND ALL YOU WANT
TO DO IS SURVEILLANCE?

21:11.810 --> 21:13.480
OKAY, UH...&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

21:13.520 --> 21:17.400
OKAY, THIS IS REALLY
WEIRD FOR ME, TINNY,
BECAUSE CHANDRA'S A GIRL.

21:17.440 --> 21:22.440
DES! OBVIOUSLY I DON'T
CARE WHAT SKANK YOU MIGHT BE
MAKING OUT WITH.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.400
UH, THAT SKANK
HAS A NAME!

21:24.450 --> 21:25.910
SHE'S NOT A SKANK.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.240
DO YOU HAVE THE
DOCUMENTS I WANT OR NOT?

21:32.410 --> 21:33.870
SHE SEEMS NICE.

21:33.910 --> 21:35.170
SEE YA.

21:38.790 --> 21:42.340
I DON'T KNOW. I GOT IT
OUT OF THAT SECRET COMPARTMENT
OF THAT CIGARETTE CASE.

21:42.380 --> 21:45.050
THOUGHT IT WOULD OPEN
A LOCK BOX OR A SAFE,
OR...

21:45.840 --> 21:47.800
SOMETHING.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.850
JUST WOULD HAVE BEEN
NICE TO KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE GETTING US INTO.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.010
THAT'S ALL.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.060
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO THINK I WAS A THIEF.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.560
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO GET DEACON
OFF MY BACK.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.230
I'M SORRY.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.770
UH, POP, ROSE.
I THINK I FIGURED IT OUT.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.650
OH, EXCUSE US.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.070
LET'S GO INSIDE.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.740
LISTEN,

22:07.780 --> 22:10.830
THE COPS THINK
THAT YOU KILLED YOUR UNCLE,
AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.710
-DID YOU?
-NO, I DIDN'T.

22:15.750 --> 22:19.040
LOOK, I JUST WANTED
THAT MONEY THAT
DEACON OWED ME. THAT'S IT.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.880
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
MY UNCLE EDDIE
WAS GONNA DIE.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.470
JAKE, WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO THE POOR GIRL?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.380
DID HE ASK YOU OUT?

22:27.430 --> 22:28.470
THAT WOULD MAKE ANY WOMAN CRY.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.800
HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.

22:31.430 --> 22:32.930
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-I WANT TO HELP.

22:32.970 --> 22:34.560
DAD SAID YOU NEED
SOME BACK-UP, SOME GUY'S

22:34.600 --> 22:35.730
THREATENING HER OR SOMETHING?

22:35.770 --> 22:36.980
WHY WOULD
I WANT YOUR BACK-UP?

22:37.020 --> 22:39.520
BECAUSE. LOOK, YOU
GO DO YOUR CASE STUFF.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.270
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HER.
ALL RIGHT?

22:41.310 --> 22:43.150
OH COME ON RELAX, JAKE.

22:43.190 --> 22:45.240
MARIE, I'M GONNA
KEEP YOU COMPANY

22:45.280 --> 22:47.400
WHILE JAKE GETS
SOME THINGS DONE.

22:47.780 --> 22:48.910
IT'S FINE.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.410
OKAY.

22:50.450 --> 22:52.370
[CHRISTIAN] HEY, HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE GYPSY TEA-ROOM?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.410
HISTORY? C+

22:56.450 --> 22:57.580
I KNOW.

22:57.620 --> 23:00.250
ANYWAY, THEY HAVE MY
FIRST NAME WRONG.
SIMPLE MISTAKE.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.960
-THERE YOU GO.
-IT TOOK
ONE PHONE CALL.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.460
THEY FIXED THE SPELLING AND
FAXED IT RIGHT ON OVER.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.380
ONE PHONE CALL, HUH?

23:07.420 --> 23:10.390
I WAS CALLING AND CALLING
AND CALLING...

23:10.430 --> 23:11.970
WE GOTTA GET
THIS HISTORY MARK UP.

23:12.010 --> 23:13.970
DON'T KNOW YOUR HISTORY,
YOU'RE LIKELY TO REPEAT IT.

23:14.010 --> 23:16.310
THAT'S TRUE.
I'M GONNA GET ON THAT
RIGHT NOW.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.140
HEY, TINNY.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.480
HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR THE EFFORT.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.650
POP, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

23:24.690 --> 23:27.070
GO ON WITH YOU.
I FOUND IT IN JAKE'S CAR
ANYWAY. GO ON.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.580
SHE'S GOT A BRAIN,
THAT ONE.

23:36.620 --> 23:37.910
YEAH, SHE'S A SMART
ONE ALL RIGHT.

23:39.210 --> 23:42.420
SO, CHRISTIAN INVITED
MARIE OUT FOR A BITE.

23:43.290 --> 23:44.880
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.

23:44.920 --> 23:49.170
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT SHE'S INTO
THE SUPER SLOW
JELLO HEAD TYPES.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.220
JAKE, DON'T BE SUCKY.

23:51.260 --> 23:52.680
IT ONLY MAKES YOU LOOK WORSE
THAN YOU ARE.

23:52.720 --> 23:53.970
[JAKE] I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT THIS KEY OPENS

23:54.010 --> 23:56.100
SO IF SHE COMES BACK
WITH ROMEO,

23:56.140 --> 23:59.390
DO ME A FAVOR,
TELL HER I'M OFF
SOLVING HER CASE.

24:00.270 --> 24:01.770
-OKAY.
-SKIPPER.

24:12.030 --> 24:13.870
TINNY, TINNY, TINNY.

24:17.740 --> 24:18.870
CHRISTIAN IS ONLY
TRYING TO HELP.

24:18.910 --> 24:21.210
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
HE HAS A NATURAL CHARM
WITH THE WOMEN.

24:21.250 --> 24:24.040
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU VOLUNTEERING HIM
TO HELP ME.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.710
IT'S JUST AWESOME.

24:26.750 --> 24:30.380
FIRST OFF, I APPRECIATE
THE CHEJU, MALACHY, TO COVER
THE WINDOW COSTS.

24:30.420 --> 24:31.630
BECAUSE OF YOU
I DIDN'T LOSE MY JOB.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.470
GOOD FOR YOU.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.430
I TOLD MY BOSS THERE WAS
A WIND DAMAGE.

24:36.470 --> 24:37.970
KEY, NED?

24:38.010 --> 24:41.690
SEE, THE THING IS, B'Y,
I FIND MY EYES ARE
STARTING TO GO.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.980
NEEDS THAT LASER EYE SURGERY?

24:44.600 --> 24:45.810
THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE RACKET.

24:52.780 --> 24:54.030
I'M TAKING A KEY CHAIN.

24:55.740 --> 24:57.990
HE'S HAD A ROUGH DAY.
HEART-BREAK. ALL OF THAT.

24:58.030 --> 25:02.580
IT LOOKS LIKE IT OPENS
UP SOME HIGH-FALUTIN LOCK BOX,
PRETTY RARE.

25:02.620 --> 25:05.000
IT'S EXPENSIVE TOO.
WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT NOW?

25:05.040 --> 25:06.460
PART OF
AN INVESTIGATION.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.500
[NED] OH. NOW TECHNICALLY
I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK A KEY

25:09.550 --> 25:10.710
THAT I KNOW ISN'T YOURS.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.840
LOCKSMITH'S OATH.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.510
LOCKSMITH'S OATH?

25:14.550 --> 25:17.260
THERE'S AN OATH.
JUST SAYING.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.100
WE ALREADY PAID FOR THE
WINDOW, NED.

25:19.140 --> 25:21.470
YEAH, BUT SOME
NEW BLINDS WOULD BE NICE.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.560
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

25:26.770 --> 25:27.860
WHAT?

25:27.900 --> 25:29.320
JAKE, YOU MIGHT WANNA
GET DOWN HERE FAST.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.280
YOUR EX-WIFE'S
CURRENT HUSBAND,

25:31.320 --> 25:32.650
HE JUST WENT
INTO A MASSAGE PARLOR,

25:32.690 --> 25:34.570
AND JAKE,
I THINK IT'S LIKE A...

25:34.610 --> 25:37.120
I... I THINK IT'S LIKE
A DIRTY ONE.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.620
HOW ABOUT
CUTTING US COPY, NED?

25:38.660 --> 25:42.250
UH, WELL, THE SALE TAKES
PRECEDENCE OVER THE OATH,
SO...

25:42.290 --> 25:44.330
-50 BUCKS.
-WHAT?

25:45.670 --> 25:46.580
KEEP HIM THERE.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.130
IT'S A LONG KEY.

25:49.170 --> 25:50.340
ALL RIGHT, NED.

25:51.460 --> 25:52.590
I WANT MY CHANGE.

25:52.630 --> 25:54.630
YOU SHOULD GET OVER TO
THE BAKERY, LOOK AROUND.

25:55.130 --> 25:56.380
I GOTTA...

25:56.430 --> 25:57.510
GO GET A MASSAGE.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.140
IT'S A LONG STORY.
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE BAKERY.

25:59.180 --> 26:00.560
WATCH HIM.
AND GET MY CHANGE.

26:08.310 --> 26:10.270
HEY, OCCUPIED HERE!

26:10.320 --> 26:11.730
DAVID, WHAT THE HELL?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.650
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NOT HOW IT SEEMS.

26:13.690 --> 26:14.740
OH, NOT HOW IT SEEMS?

26:14.780 --> 26:15.860
BECAUSE IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU HAVE A

26:15.900 --> 26:18.410
SMOKING HOT NAKED
MISSUS GIVING
YOU A MASSAGE.

26:18.450 --> 26:20.280
-JAKE... JAKE...
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

26:22.620 --> 26:23.660
NIKKI! HI, HOW ARE YOU?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.250
JAKE, PLEASE!

26:26.580 --> 26:28.380
HEY, I'M SORRY
ABOUT TODAY.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.500
OH, YEAH,
ABOUT TODAY, NIKKI.

26:30.540 --> 26:31.590
TELL ME THAT'S NOT NIKKI.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.130
IS THAT DAVID?
ARE YOU WITH
DAVID RIGHT NOW?

26:35.670 --> 26:37.880
NO, NO, NO. GOD NO.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.470
ANYWAY, YOU TALKED ME
OFF A DANGEROUS LEDGE TODAY.

26:40.510 --> 26:42.560
YOU'RE RIGHT.
DAVID WOULD NEVER
CHEAT ON ME.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.480
HE'S ROCK SOLID.
HE'S TOO GOOD.
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.980
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

26:49.020 --> 26:51.560
UH... UH, SURE.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.940
I'M HER LAWYER.
SHE'S FILING SUIT AGAINST
HER EMPLOYER.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.860
YOU GUYS, TAKE THIS
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.610
-WOULD YOU
JUST TELL HIM?
-GET OUT!

27:01.830 --> 27:03.870
[DAVID] SHE IS MISTREATED
AS A SEX WORKER.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.750
I'M DOING THE WORK PRO-BONO.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.790
YOU GOT A MASSAGE WITH
YOUR EX-WIFE'S HUSBAND?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.040
NOT LIKELY.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.750
SHE'S FILING A SUIT
AGAINST THE GUY WHO
OWNS THE PLACE.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.050
I HAD TO GO THERE
AND ACT LIKE A CLIENT,

27:14.090 --> 27:15.840
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T
GET FOUND OUT.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.220
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.340
JUST GO WAIT IN THE CAR
AND SHUT UP.

27:22.970 --> 27:23.970
DON'T START WITH ME.

27:29.940 --> 27:30.850
[DEACON] JUST TRY AGAIN.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.230
JAM IT OPEN WITH A FORK.
FORKS ARE GOOD.

27:33.270 --> 27:34.860
IT'S NOT OPENING
WITHOUT THE KEY.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.320
THE KEY, REMEMBER?

27:36.360 --> 27:37.610
THE ONE YOUR FRIGGIN
GIRLFRIEND HAS?

27:37.650 --> 27:39.490
YEAH, MARIE MUST HAVE IT.
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

27:39.530 --> 27:41.030
GET IT BACK
FROM HER, IDIOT.

27:41.070 --> 27:42.240
JUST WATCH YOURSELF,
FERRIGNO.

27:43.780 --> 27:47.040
DO YOU EVER THINK
BEFORE YOU SPEAK?

27:47.080 --> 27:48.960
SERIOUSLY. YOU SOUND
LIKE A MORON.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.000
LET'S FIND MARIE
AND GET THE KEY.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.380
YEAH? AND WHAT
IF SHE DOESN'T GIVE
IT BACK TO US?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.880
THEN WE'LL DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO CONVINCE HER.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.180
ALL RIGHT.

28:09.310 --> 28:10.600
IT SOUNDS LIKE MARIE
IS IN DANGER.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.770
YOU'D BETTER CALL CHRISTIAN.

28:13.810 --> 28:14.810
I'M ON IT.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.820
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

28:18.650 --> 28:19.900
YEAH?

28:19.940 --> 28:21.950
HEY CHRISTIAN,
KEEP AN EYE
OUT FOR SOME THUGS.

28:21.990 --> 28:23.950
-THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MARIE.
-ALL RIGHT, I'M ON IT.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.290
CHRISTIAN'S
GOT MARIE SAFE.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.580
GOOD BOY HE IS,
HE'LL PROTECT HER.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.830
YEAH, YEAH.
LET'S JUST OPEN THIS THING

28:31.870 --> 28:33.790
AND FIND OUT
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.460
&lt;BEEPING&gt;

28:38.800 --> 28:39.920
WHOA!

28:40.470 --> 28:42.050
UGH.

28:42.090 --> 28:44.430
THAT IS NOT WHAT I
EXPECTED TO SEE AT ALL.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.770
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO THINK THAT THAT'S
EDWIN WINTERS' HAND?

28:49.810 --> 28:51.060
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY,

28:51.100 --> 28:52.980
DO WE THINK MARIE
CUT IT OFF OF HIM?

28:53.020 --> 28:54.850
[JAKE] WHY WOULD SOMEONE
AS HOT AS HER GO AROUND

28:54.900 --> 28:56.980
CUTTING OFF CORPSES' LIMBS?

28:57.020 --> 28:59.940
EITHER WAY,
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHY
EVERYONE WANTS

28:59.980 --> 29:01.820
THIS SEVERED HAND.

29:01.860 --> 29:03.320
DES! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

29:03.360 --> 29:06.570
OH, UH, WELL, I WAS JUST,
I WAS GETTING FINGER PRINTS.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.410
THAT WAY WE CAN RUN
THEM AND WE CAN FIND OUT
WHO'S HAND THIS REALLY IS...

29:09.450 --> 29:11.290
WAS, IS, WAS!

29:11.330 --> 29:13.370
-THIS IS EVIDENCE, MAN!
-PUT IT DOWN, YOU MEATHEAD.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.380
WE GOTTA
GIVE THAT TO THE COPS.
STOP RUINING THE EVIDENCE.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.750
SORRY B'YS.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.670
HI. WHAT'S THAT?

29:22.630 --> 29:24.430
DON'T ASK.
TALK IN A BIT, HONEY.

29:24.970 --> 29:25.800
OKAY.

29:28.010 --> 29:29.560
SO, DID YOU HEAR
THE GOOD NEWS?

29:29.600 --> 29:30.850
YEAH. YEAH, I DID.
THEY'RE BRINGING BACK

29:30.890 --> 29:33.350
SMURF ICE CREAM AT
MOO-MOOS. WICKED.

29:33.390 --> 29:35.480
TINNY WAS ABLE TO TRACK
DOWN HER TRANSCRIPTS.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.110
OH YEAH?
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS MISSING.

29:38.150 --> 29:40.020
YEAH. IT ARRIVED
JUST IN TIME FROM ENGLAND.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.780
ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT?

29:43.150 --> 29:44.200
WELL, THERE'S A
TIME DIFFERENCE.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.530
EXPLAINS CERTAIN DELAYS.

29:45.570 --> 29:47.160
LIKE, WE'RE SIX MONTHS BEHIND
IN GETTING NEW EPISODES

29:47.200 --> 29:49.080
OF CORONATION STREET.
THAT SUCKS.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.790
SPILL IT, COURTNEY,

29:51.830 --> 29:54.210
BECAUSE IT'LL ONLY GET WORSE
AFTER THIS.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.290
HOW DID I TIP IT?
IT WAS THE CALLIGRAPHY,
WASN'T IT?

29:56.330 --> 29:57.670
-IT WAS TOO MUCH.
-NO.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.130
FAXES DON'T COME THROUGH ON
PERFECT 28 POUND PAPER.

30:04.380 --> 30:05.510
NO, THEY DON'T.

30:09.100 --> 30:13.140
EDWIN WINTERS FROM MY
CRIME SCENE WAS MISSING THAT
HAND WHEN WE FOUND HIM.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.560
SO YOU SUSPECT
OUR CLIENT,

30:14.600 --> 30:15.940
MARIE, OF DISMEMBERING
THE BODY?

30:15.980 --> 30:17.560
LOOK, I KNOW I JUST MET
THE GIRL,

30:17.600 --> 30:18.900
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S NOT GOING TO, YOU KNOW,

30:18.940 --> 30:20.940
CUT HER DEAD UNCLE'S ARM OFF.

30:20.980 --> 30:23.320
THE LACK OF BLOOD
SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS SEVERED
POST-MORTEM,

30:23.360 --> 30:25.030
SO WHOEVER DID IT
WAS A SICK FREAK.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.570
-I'D SAY.
-[JAKE] LISTEN, I'M JUST

30:26.610 --> 30:29.200
HAPPY TO SEE, LESLIE,
THAT YOU'RE SHOWING SOME
SIGNS OF JEALOUSY AGAIN.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.030
IT'S GOOD.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.790
MALACHY, TELL JAKE
HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND
SOLD AN ITEM

30:33.830 --> 30:35.080
STOLEN FROM
THE DEAD MAN,

30:35.120 --> 30:37.170
AND DIDN'T REPORT THE BODY
UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTER.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.210
CLASSIC IN FAMILIAL MURDERS.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.130
RIGHT NOW, SHE'S OUR
NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

30:42.960 --> 30:46.670
SO, WHAT'S YOUR NEXT
GIRLFRIEND GOING TO BE,
A NECROPHILIAC?

30:49.140 --> 30:52.600
TIME TO PLAY A DEMENTED
CINDERELLA AND SEE IF THE
HAND MATCHES THE BODY.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.560
DOYLE, DID YOU DO THIS?

30:59.600 --> 31:00.940
YES, B'Y.
I'M ALWAYS AT THAT.

31:05.490 --> 31:08.280
IF I FIND OUT YOU HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

31:08.320 --> 31:11.370
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'LL HANG YOU FROM
CABOT TOWER.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.790
SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK?

31:15.830 --> 31:18.160
DEACON AND KELLY ARE THE
TWO GENIUSES THAT
CAME BACK FOR THE BODY?

31:18.210 --> 31:19.920
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE
ROWING ABOUT
BACK AT THE BAKERY.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.210
SO WHAT'S THEIR NEXT MOVE?

31:21.250 --> 31:24.170
AH, GOD,
I HOPE I'M WRONG,
BUT I THINK I KNOW.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.390
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
ARE YOU DOING?

31:40.020 --> 31:41.230
JAKE! THE BODY!

31:54.870 --> 31:55.910
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

31:57.120 --> 31:59.250
WHY ARE THEY TRYING
TO CUT UP A DEAD BODY?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.630
I THINK I'VE GOT
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.790
NOW LET'S GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.960
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

32:06.000 --> 32:09.050
HOW IN THE LOVE
OF GOD DID I LET YOU GET
ME INTO THIS, JAKE?

32:09.090 --> 32:11.630
OH, LORD! OH, THE SMELL.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.010
THE BODY IS RANCID.

32:13.050 --> 32:13.970
IT STINKS.

32:14.010 --> 32:16.180
GOTTA GET IT TO
THE COPS QUICK.
GO ON, MOVE IT!

32:16.220 --> 32:18.310
OH, YES B'Y.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO
EXPLAIN TO THE COPS

32:18.350 --> 32:21.730
WHY WE HAVE A DEAD BODY,
AND THAT IT'S COVERED
IN FRIGGIN' WHITE FLOUR?

32:21.770 --> 32:23.060
I THINK I'M GONNA
THROW UP.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.560
DON'T YOU DARE THROW UP
IN THE CAR, DAD.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.650
-DO NOT THROW UP IN THIS CAR!
-&lt;GROANING&gt;

32:26.690 --> 32:28.110
I'LL, I'LL PULL UP HERE.

32:28.150 --> 32:29.280
I'LL PULL UP HERE!

32:29.320 --> 32:30.650
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

32:35.200 --> 32:36.990
&lt;COUGHING&gt;
OH, MY GOD!

32:37.030 --> 32:38.910
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

32:38.950 --> 32:40.080
LET'S GET HIM
IN THE TRUNK.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.370
-I GOT HIM.
-OKAY.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.040
GO GET SOME ICE.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.290
&lt;GROANING&gt;

32:53.470 --> 32:55.180
HELP ME GET HIM
IN THE TRUNK.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.350
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO!

33:05.480 --> 33:06.980
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

33:08.360 --> 33:10.230
-WHAT?
-[CHRISTIAN] DON'T FREAK OUT.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.900
THE COPS HAVE MARIE.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.610
THEY'RE OFFICIALLY
CHARGING HER WITH MURDER.

33:13.650 --> 33:15.070
OH, GREAT.

33:15.110 --> 33:16.030
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

33:16.070 --> 33:17.120
WHAT?

33:17.160 --> 33:19.040
MAL, I HAVE TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING,

33:19.080 --> 33:20.370
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KEEP PERSPECTIVE.

33:20.410 --> 33:22.160
NO OFFENSE, ROSE,
BUT GET TO IT.

33:22.210 --> 33:23.330
TINNY FAKED
THE TRANSCRIPT.

33:23.370 --> 33:24.830
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

33:24.870 --> 33:26.670
SHE NEVER WENT
TO SCHOOL IN LONDON.

33:27.670 --> 33:28.920
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:34.760 --> 33:37.180
WHO WAS...
THEY JUST TOOK THE CAR!

33:37.220 --> 33:38.220
AND THE BODY.

33:43.890 --> 33:45.650
-FREEZE!
-WHOA!

33:45.690 --> 33:46.900
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM!

33:46.940 --> 33:48.940
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES!

33:48.980 --> 33:50.020
ALL RIGHT!

33:55.450 --> 33:57.530
SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME

33:58.370 --> 34:00.200
YOU FOUND THE MISSING BODY,

34:00.240 --> 34:01.370
YOU MOVED IT FROM
THE CRIME SCENE

34:01.410 --> 34:02.410
AND THEN YOU LOST IT.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.250
YES.

34:04.290 --> 34:05.420
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU COVERED IN?

34:07.170 --> 34:09.500
WELL, THIS IS FLOUR,
BUT THAT'S A LONG STORY.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.960
AND YOU WITHHELD
EVIDENCE FROM A MURDER CASE.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.380
YES, BUT LESLIE,
THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.140
WHERE IS
EDWIN WINTERS' BODY?

34:17.180 --> 34:18.430
I WANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW.

34:18.470 --> 34:19.970
HIS BODY IS IN
THE TRUNK OF MY CAR,

34:20.010 --> 34:21.260
BUT THE CAR WAS STOLEN.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.430
BUT YOU SEE, YOU FIND
THE CAR AND YOU FIND YOUR

34:23.470 --> 34:25.060
ONE-HANDED... ROTTING...

34:25.560 --> 34:26.980
CORPSE.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.690
YOU BLATANTLY LIED!

34:28.730 --> 34:31.230
AND WHAT'S WORSE,
YOU COOKED UP A SCHEME,

34:31.270 --> 34:32.610
YOU PRESENTED IT TO US,

34:32.650 --> 34:34.280
AND THEN LIED RIGHT
TO OUR FACES!

34:34.320 --> 34:36.110
-POPPY
-I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE!

34:36.150 --> 34:37.410
NOT RIGHT NOW!
IT'S MY TURN!

34:37.450 --> 34:38.870
MALACHY, REMEMBER,
WE'RE IN A POLICE STATION.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.370
GOOD! I SHOULD HAVE
HER LOCKED UP.

34:40.410 --> 34:42.290
GRAND LARCENY. TINNY,

34:42.330 --> 34:44.660
WE GAVE YOU 10 THOUSAND
DOLLARS FOR YOUR TUITION.

34:44.700 --> 34:46.000
WHAT THE HELL DID
YOU DO WITH IT?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.830
I STILL HAVE IT.
THE MONEY...

34:47.870 --> 34:49.540
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
ALL THESE MONTHS.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.380
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE?

34:51.420 --> 34:53.300
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A GOOD LIAR?

34:54.090 --> 34:55.130
I'LL PAY IT BACK.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.090
NO, YOU'LL LISTEN TO ME.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.260
YOU'RE GOING
TO COME CLEAN WITH ME,

34:59.300 --> 35:01.260
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.060
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE
ME THAT DAMN MONEY BACK.

35:06.850 --> 35:08.480
WHY WAS HE
COVERED IN FLOUR?

35:09.520 --> 35:12.190
NOT A GOOD TIME TO ASK.
LET'S GO.

35:12.230 --> 35:13.230
[LESLIE] STUPID IDIOT!

35:13.270 --> 35:14.900
LESLIE, COULD YOU
PLEASE JUST STOP
YELLING AT ME.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.280
MARIE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.280
POSSESSION OF BODY PARTS,
BREAK AND ENTRY,

35:19.320 --> 35:21.990
WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE,
CONTAMINATING CRIME SCENES,

35:22.030 --> 35:23.910
MOVING DEAD BODIES?

35:23.950 --> 35:25.200
IF MARIE KILLED
HER UNCLE,

35:25.240 --> 35:27.250
THEN WHY DID SHE HIRE ME
TO FIND THE CIGARETTE CASE

35:27.290 --> 35:28.540
THAT YOU WERE PLANNING
TO CONVICT HER WITH?

35:28.580 --> 35:30.120
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT!

35:33.960 --> 35:36.420
YOU KNOW, YOU DOYLES
WALK AROUND THIS STATION
LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.260
-LESLIE...
-I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT!

35:39.590 --> 35:41.140
-GET OUT!
-I...

35:42.220 --> 35:45.770
I NEED YOU TO...
YOU NEED TO FIND MY CAR!

35:45.810 --> 35:49.020
WE NEED TO SALVAGE
THIS DAY SOMEHOW,

35:49.060 --> 35:52.440
AND THE BEST WAY I CAN
THINK OF IS TO PROVE THAT
POOR GIRL IS INNOCENT.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.770
ALL RIGHT.
JUST LET ME CALL MY

35:55.940 --> 35:59.450
EX-WIFE'S... HUSBAND.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.110
I HAD TO STEAL NIKKI'S
KEYS TO GET YOU IN HERE.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.240
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.370
IF SHE FINDS OUT... PLEASE,

36:06.410 --> 36:10.210
PLEASE DON'T DESTROY
ANYTHING IN HERE, OKAY?

36:10.250 --> 36:13.000
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO
TO A RUB N' TUG OR SOMETHING?

36:13.040 --> 36:14.590
AND KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

36:14.630 --> 36:17.760
I PROMISE WE WON'T LEAVE
ANYTHING HERE MORE DEAD

36:17.800 --> 36:19.130
THAN WHEN WE
FOUND IT, SO GET OUT.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.340
-WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES...
-GET OUT.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.050
&lt;HUFFING&gt;

36:24.260 --> 36:25.640
IS HE CHEATING ON NIKKI?

36:25.680 --> 36:28.310
NO, ACTUALLY,
HIS STORY CHECKS OUT.

36:28.350 --> 36:29.600
I TALKED TO THE MASSEUSE.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.400
I'M JUST GONNA YANK
HIS CHAIN A BIT.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.940
LEAVE THE POOR
COUPLE ALONE.

36:33.980 --> 36:36.150
JUST BE HAPPY YOU AND
NIKKI AREN'T TRYING
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

36:41.070 --> 36:44.370
SO, THESE GUYS,
THEY GET IT IN THEIR HEAD
TO ROB SOME RICH GUY.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.780
IF THEY WANT
THE REAL SCORE,

36:45.830 --> 36:47.370
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE.

36:47.410 --> 36:49.700
THEY JUST NEED...

36:49.750 --> 36:52.710
ONE THING TO MAKE
IT ALL HAPPEN.

36:52.750 --> 36:55.040
GUYS, I THINK I JUST
HEARD A...&lt;GASP&gt;

37:12.270 --> 37:13.480
CAN YOU TRY
LIFTING HIM UP?

37:13.520 --> 37:14.770
I AM LIFTING.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.570
OKAY.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.940
&lt;BEEPING&gt;

37:21.280 --> 37:22.320
FINALLY.

37:25.610 --> 37:26.700
YES!

37:33.910 --> 37:36.250
YOU, UH, FELLAS
NEED A "HAND"?

37:47.390 --> 37:48.640
&lt;BEEPING&gt;

37:48.680 --> 37:53.350
SO, DID I EARN YOUR
FATHERLY LOVE OR WHAT?

37:53.390 --> 37:56.940
YOU DID GREAT. ALMOST AS
GOOD AS CHRISTIAN.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.150
YEAH, WELL,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.230
UGH.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.490
YOU OKAY?

38:03.530 --> 38:05.030
YUP. I'M FINE.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.660
THERE YOU GO.

38:11.700 --> 38:15.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I JUST... I GUESS I CRACKED.

38:16.920 --> 38:17.960
I DIDN'T GO.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.550
LIKE, HOW COULD I LEAVE
YOU GUYS BEHIND?

38:23.670 --> 38:24.840
AND JAKE?

38:25.510 --> 38:26.470
AND...

38:29.010 --> 38:31.470
I KNOW IT MAKES ME
LOOK LIKE A TOOL.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.890
NO, IT DOESN'T.

38:33.470 --> 38:34.520
BUT THE LYING PART?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.850
-THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
-I GUESS.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.610
I MEAN,

38:41.190 --> 38:42.980
I KNOW.

38:43.030 --> 38:45.190
TINNY, YOU ACT LIKE A
GROWN-UP, BUT YOU'RE A KID.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.110
YOU CAN ACT YOUR AGE,
YOU KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.200
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST COME HOME?

38:50.240 --> 38:52.990
I DID. BY THE TIME
I FIGURED THINGS OUT
AND GOT HERE,

38:53.040 --> 38:54.830
YOU GUYS WERE ALREADY
GONE ON VACATION.

38:55.540 --> 38:56.960
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.460
SO INSTEAD YOU JUST
BLEW THE MONEY.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.790
NO, I SWEAR.

38:59.830 --> 39:01.880
I DIDN'T TOUCH A CENT
OF THE MONEY.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.340
I WORKED TWO JOBS
THE WHOLE TIME.

39:04.380 --> 39:06.380
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S A LIE
AND WHAT ISN'T ANYMORE.

39:07.930 --> 39:11.510
I JUST, I THOUGHT
I'D LET YOU DOWN
BY NOT GOING, SO...

39:11.550 --> 39:13.350
TINNY, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.230
THE BIGGEST LET-DOWN HERE
IS THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER
LIED TO ME.

39:19.230 --> 39:20.480
I AM SORRY.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.160
YOU'RE GONNA CATCH UP
ON ALL OF IT,

39:38.210 --> 39:40.460
THE SCHOOL YOU MISSED.
NIGHT CLASSES. WEEKENDS.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.750
I KNOW. I WILL.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.340
DON'T EVER DO THAT
TO ME AGAIN, OKAY?

39:48.380 --> 39:51.300
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,
YOU'LL BREAK
A YOUNG MAN'S HEART.

39:52.550 --> 39:54.260
I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ON THIS PLANET.

39:54.310 --> 39:55.310
REMEMBER THAT.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.610
SO WE FOUND THE
SEVERED HAND IN THE VAULT,

40:04.650 --> 40:07.190
ALONG WITH THE TWO PERPS
AND THE DEAD BODY.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.490
I'M SURE I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

40:09.530 --> 40:12.660
RIGHT, AND IT'S FUNNY
HOW YOU MAGICALLY
GOT YOUR CAR BACK.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.160
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
REALLY, REALLY NICE TODAY.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.830
DON'T EVEN TRY IT, OKAY.

40:17.870 --> 40:20.710
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY
PISSING ME OFF JAKE. REALLY.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.500
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

40:28.210 --> 40:29.670
JAKE. HI.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.590
HI.

40:31.630 --> 40:32.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
THANK YOU.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.600
WELL, I COULD THINK
OF A COUPLE OF WAYS,

40:36.640 --> 40:39.770
BUT YOU SEEM TO
BE HAVING A PRETTY
GOOD TIME OVER THERE.

40:39.810 --> 40:41.480
MAYBE I CAN START BY
BUYING YOU A DRINK TONIGHT.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.730
ME, YOU AND MY BROTHER,
YOU MEAN?

40:43.770 --> 40:45.730
HE DOES REMIND ME
OF SOMEBODY,

40:45.770 --> 40:46.980
AND HE JUST SPENT
THE ENTIRE TIME

40:47.020 --> 40:48.230
TALKING ABOUT WHAT
A GREAT GUY YOU ARE.

40:50.690 --> 40:51.860
IS THAT SO?

40:51.900 --> 40:52.910
&lt;CHIME&gt;

40:53.700 --> 40:54.870
SORRY.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.910
I WOULD LOVE TO GO HAVE
A DRINK WITH YOU.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.450
IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE
TO BUY YOU DINNER.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.710
I JUST, I NEED TO TAKE
A RAIN CHECK.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.170
I CAN'T DO IT TONIGHT.

41:04.210 --> 41:07.840
YES. BUT I'M NOT GONNA
WAIT FOREVER FOR YOU, BUDDY.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.220
UNDERSTOOD.

41:18.850 --> 41:20.770
LET ME GUESS,
YOU WERE DOING
THE WHOLE

41:20.810 --> 41:22.350
TALKING NICE
ABOUT ME THING,

41:22.390 --> 41:23.980
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY AN ANGLE,

41:24.020 --> 41:25.900
RIGHT, SO YOU COULD
SWEEP IN FOR THE STEAL?

41:26.940 --> 41:29.570
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU,
BUTTONS, SHE'S HOT.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.820
BUT NONE OF US
REALLY CHANGE, DO WE?

41:31.860 --> 41:32.990
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

41:36.570 --> 41:37.700
-[NIKKI] JAKE?
-RELAX, B'Y. RELAX.

41:37.740 --> 41:38.910
I'M ON MY WAY.

41:48.790 --> 41:53.130
OH, HEY.
UH, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOU FOR SOMETHING.

41:53.170 --> 41:54.430
NO JAKE, I HAVE TO...

41:54.470 --> 41:57.180
SHUT UP! LISTEN TO ME,
PLEASE! OKAY?

41:57.220 --> 42:01.220
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
I FOLLOWED DAVID.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.020
I FOLLOWED DAVID.

42:03.730 --> 42:06.190
I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

42:06.230 --> 42:07.560
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.770
HE TOLD YOU. SERIOUSLY?

42:08.810 --> 42:10.730
YEAH. HE TOLD ME ALL
ABOUT THE MASSAGE PARLOR.

42:10.770 --> 42:13.190
EVERYTHING. AND IT'S FINE.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.360
WOW. I'M IMPRESSED.

42:16.410 --> 42:18.120
IF THAT WAS ME,
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE

42:18.160 --> 42:20.950
SPLIT MY HEAD OPEN
FOR ONLY HALF THAT, BUT...

42:20.990 --> 42:23.830
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS
ENJOYED THAT HE DOES
PRO-BONO WORK.

42:23.870 --> 42:26.790
PRO... WELL,
HE PICKS INTERESTING
CLIENTS FOR HIS

42:28.170 --> 42:29.630
PRO-BONO WORK.

42:29.670 --> 42:31.960
STOP.
HE IS A GOOD MAN.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.630
I KNOW. I KNOW.

42:34.550 --> 42:35.800
WHY DID YOU
FOLLOW HIM?

42:35.840 --> 42:37.680
I FOLLOWED HIM BECAUSE
YOU ASKED ME TO FOLLOW HIM.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.800
NO, BECAUSE YOU SAID
THAT YOU WOULDN'T,

42:39.850 --> 42:41.930
AND THEN YOU DID,
EVEN AFTER YOU TOLD ME
TO LET IT LAY.

42:43.640 --> 42:44.980
ALL RIGHT.

42:47.770 --> 42:50.650
OKAY, NIKKI, I KNOW THAT
YOU AND I WEREN'T EXACTLY

42:51.480 --> 42:53.230
GOOD FOR EACH OTHER.
I KNOW THAT.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.700
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

42:56.740 --> 43:00.240
OR THAT I DON'T OR WON'T
ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.950
SO, SOMEONE MESSES WITH YOU,

43:02.990 --> 43:05.000
I'M GONNA HAVE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM WITH THAT.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.290
SUE ME.

43:08.170 --> 43:09.750
THANK, THANK YOU.
THAT'S NICE.

43:10.630 --> 43:11.920
ALL RIGHT.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.750
AND, UH, YOU KNOW...

43:16.050 --> 43:17.470
SAME HERE.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.590
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, TOO.
