01:03.230 --> 01:04.732
Hey, partner.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.073
Hold on there, just a second.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.880
Where are you headed, there?

01:14.241 --> 01:15.879
Where are you headed up to?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.684
How are you doing there, bud?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.690
Huh? Are you okay?
Where are you headed?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.248
You headed down the road, there, huh?

01:21.348 --> 01:22.520
Huh?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.358
Where are you coming from?

01:25.252 --> 01:26.697
Yeah?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.564
There he is.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.133
Thank you.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.714
Well, there's the man of the hour.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.547
The what?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.556
The man of the hour.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.752
I... I don't know.

03:37.084 --> 03:41.032
So, you told the sheriff
that you were walking to Nebraska?

03:41.488 --> 03:42.865
That's right.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.096
To get my million dollars.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.769
What million dollars?

03:56.837 --> 04:00.080
"We are now authorized to
pay one million dollars

04:00.173 --> 04:03.552
"to Woodrow T. Grant
of Billings, Montana."

04:03.610 --> 04:05.021
Let me see that.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.356
And your mother won't take me.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.917
"Mega Sweepstakes Marketing."

04:10.016 --> 04:12.360
Dad, this is a total come-on.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.093
It's... It's one
of the oldest gimmicks in the book.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.031
I didn't even know
they still did it anymore.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.070
Well, they can't say it if it's not true.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.629
They're just trying to
sell you magazines.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.767
It says I won.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.538
So, mail it in.
I'll help you.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.204
I'm not trusting the mail
with a million dollars.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.732
You dumb cluck.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.437
You pretty near gave me a heart attack!

04:59.499 --> 05:01.570
Just cool your jets.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.809
This is the second time
he's tried to sneak out.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.575
I never knew the son of a bitch

05:06.640 --> 05:08.950
even wanted to be a millionaire.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.818
He should have
thought about that years ago

05:10.911 --> 05:12.584
and worked for it.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.629
What would you do with
a million dollars anyway, Dad?

05:23.690 --> 05:25.431
Buy a new truck.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.835
You can't drive.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.929
I'll get my license back.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.771
Tell me when you do,
so I can stay off the road.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.169
I need an air compressor, too.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.508
Are you still harping on that?

05:36.603 --> 05:38.310
Ed Pegram still has mine.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.180
That's because he's a thief.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.684
He's not a thief.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.015
I lent it to him.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.782
Who's Ed Pegram?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.016
A guy I knew back in Hawthorne.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.717
And when did he borrow it?

05:48.815 --> 05:50.294
'74.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.860
That's almost 40 years.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.454
He lives two states away.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.295
I'd say he stole it.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.167
That's why I need a new one.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.205
Where are you off to now?

06:00.293 --> 06:01.966
Sitting down.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.965
He even sleeps
with that stupid letter.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.375
He's memorized it word for word.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.640
I didn't think he could
memorize anything anymore.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.719
Hey, what's with this casserole?

06:16.810 --> 06:20.087
Oh, it's lasagna.
It's still good, take it.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.392
You know what I'd do
with a million dollars?

06:25.485 --> 06:27.863
I'd put him in a home.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.421
But that's not to say
that I can't set you up

07:00.520 --> 07:02.124
with a whole lot more
reasonable speakers

07:02.222 --> 07:03.462
that'll still blow your mind

07:03.556 --> 07:05.593
if you're worried that
the Wilsons or Paradigms

07:05.692 --> 07:07.296
are going to set you back too much.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.203
You know, the way they
design speakers anymore...

07:09.262 --> 07:11.208
You can't make a mistake.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.971
Okay.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.973
All right, well, yeah, let's...

07:15.068 --> 07:17.571
We need to discuss it
and we'll get back to you.

07:17.637 --> 07:18.911
- Oh.
- I'll let you know.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.111
Let me, uh, give you a card.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.578
Give me a call any time
if you have any more questions.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.815
- All right, thank you.
Excellent.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.390
Mark, Janice, a pleasure.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.447
"Janice."

07:27.547 --> 07:29.390
"Janice." Sorry.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.128
<i>David. Call, line one.</i>

07:33.219 --> 07:35.597
<i>David Grant. Call, line one.</i>

07:47.567 --> 07:48.807
Where did they find him this time?

07:48.902 --> 07:52.645
Way the hell out
on King Avenue by the Albertsons.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.785
I can't take it anymore.

07:54.841 --> 07:58.186
Ross is in there, trying to talk
some sense into him.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.116
Ross.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.423
Hi, David.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.463
What's going on, Dad?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.261
Ask Ma and Ross.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.669
They seem to know it all.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.260
I'm asking you.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.837
Can't get her to turn over.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.833
That's because ifs been
sitting there for 10 years.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.275
Oh, I'll get it running.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.473
He still thinks
he's going to Lincoln to get his money.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.310
Hey, Dad, how come you didn't

08:26.373 --> 08:28.444
fix the truck first or take a bus?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.488
Why did you just start walking?

08:31.878 --> 08:33.619
Don't pull his chain like that.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.717
The poor guy doesn't
know what's going on half the time.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.989
I cut the solenoid wire
and stuck it back in

08:39.052 --> 08:40.725
so that'll slow him down.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.630
And Mom's right.
It's time to think about a home.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.068
She can't
handle him anymore. It's not fair to her.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.161
No. He doesn't need a nursing home.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.232
He just...
The guy just needs something to live for.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.639
That's all this is about.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.645
Yeah, and it's pathetic.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.507
Seems like drinking always gave him

08:56.569 --> 08:58.981
more than enough to live for until now.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.814
Mom and I are looking at reality,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.478
and you'd better start, too.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.579
A home is in his best interests.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.679
Which, let's face it,
is a hell of a lot more

09:06.746 --> 09:07.918
than he ever thought about with us.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.324
He never gave a shit about you or me.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.027
I saw you anchoring the other night.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.036
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.502
It's your first time in the chair, right?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.165
Yeah, Kelly Ann Castillo called in sick,

09:23.229 --> 09:24.435
so they let me fill in.

09:24.531 --> 09:28.343
And apparently I didn't
stink the place up too bad, so...

09:28.835 --> 09:30.178
Tom Brokaw.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.281
The new Tom Brokaw of Billings.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.353
I don't know
about "Tom Brokaw" exactly,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.547
but, yeah, ifs looking pretty good.

09:37.610 --> 09:38.680
I've paid my dues.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.124
Plus, Kelly Ann's got
a pretty bad infection, so...

09:48.421 --> 09:49.461
<i>Bu! opponents,</i>

09:49.556 --> 09:51.194
<i>led by Councilman Barry Tilden,</i>

09:51.257 --> 09:55.069
<i>claim the plan is
a "Pie in the Big Sky idea"</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:58.201
<i>that will cost taxpayers
more than it's worth.</i>

09:58.264 --> 10:01.040
<i>The Council is expected
to debate the propose!</i>

10:01.101 --> 10:03.081
<i>In Monday's session.</i>

10:03.236 --> 10:04.909
<i>Coming up next, in sports...</i>

10:04.971 --> 10:08.282
<i>Carter brings us the story
of a Hardin snowmobiler</i>

10:08.374 --> 10:11.719
<i>who may have lost his legs,
but not his will to compete.</i>

10:13.146 --> 10:15.786
<i>That, and more,
after the break. Stay with us.</i>

10:22.555 --> 10:24.728
Hi.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.399
Are you moving back in?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.305
No, these are yours.
I'm just returning them.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.138
Oh, right. Thanks.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.512
You want to come in?

10:51.751 --> 10:53.458
David, you need to water these plants.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.158
These are plants.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.476
I'd like you to change your mind.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.617
What does that mean?

11:18.478 --> 11:21.891
You know what it means.
I want you to move back in.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.358
But I just moved out.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.021
So, two years and we're back to dating?

11:27.554 --> 11:30.467
I don't know yet.
We'll find out in a while.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.040
Are we still having sex?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.808
I've got to go.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.873
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.878
Are you saying that we
can't be together again

11:42.969 --> 11:44.414
unless we get married?

11:44.504 --> 11:47.849
Get married, break up...
I don't know.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.419
Let's do both.
Let's... Let's do something.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.386
<i>Pick up or call me back,</i>

11:55.481 --> 11:56.926
- right now.
- Shit.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.927
<i>I don't know what
I'm going to do with him.</i>

11:59.018 --> 12:00.429
<i>I'm going to put him in a...</i>

12:00.520 --> 12:02.193
Hi, Mom. I'm here.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.016
Dad.

12:24.877 --> 12:25.912
Dad!

12:26.012 --> 12:27.685
Leave me alone.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.531
Come on, let me take you home.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.804
I'm going to Lincoln
if it's the last thing I do.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.708
I don't care what you people think.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.714
Listen to me. You didn't win anything.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.215
It's a complete scam.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.444
So you've got to stop this, okay?

12:53.539 --> 12:55.280
I'm running out of time.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.820
You don't even have a suitcase.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.286
I'm not staying there.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.721
Dad.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.053
I can't let you go.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.422
It's none of your business.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.393
Yes, it is. I'm your son.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.327
Well, then why don't you take me?

13:06.419 --> 13:07.625
I can't just drop everything

13:07.720 --> 13:09.256
and drive to Lincoln, Nebraska.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.494
Oh.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.627
What else you got going on?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.735
Have you lost your marbles, too?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.176
Get your father out of your car

13:24.270 --> 13:26.181
this goddamned instant.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.010
You need to help me.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.754
I'm the one who does
all the work around here.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.654
Your father just sits there.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.623
Look at him. He's useless.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.922
His mother spoiled him.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.656
Mom, don't worry, okay?

13:38.751 --> 13:40.492
We'll only be gone a couple of days.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.497
Why don't you just enjoy the time alone?

13:42.588 --> 13:44.534
You always complain
about having him around.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.103
What about your job?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.832
Well, I told them I was sick.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.338
Sick in the head.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.204
I'm going to tell Ross to call you.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.435
He'll back me up.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.500
Right. Sounds great. Bye, Mom.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.142
You're just like your father.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.718
Stubborn as a mule!

14:23.629 --> 14:26.803
Let me know when you
get tired. I'll drive.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.973
You can't drive.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.712
I can drive a hell of a lot better
than that moron.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.546
All right, Dad.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.883
I can drive a hell of a lot better
than that moron.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.783
Shit.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.279
Jesus Christ, Dad,
what are you doing here?

16:16.442 --> 16:17.648
Oh.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.313
I got thirsty.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.856
Well, good to see you're not drinking.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.825
Beer ain't "drinking."

16:26.652 --> 16:27.995
Let's go.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.714
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.980
How about we go see Mount Rushmore?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.913
We don't have time for that.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.855
It's just 30 minutes off the Interstate.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.325
We're right here.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.658
It's just a bunch of rocks.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.608
So, what do you think, Dad?

17:44.697 --> 17:46.904
It doesn't look finished to me.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.444
How do you mean?

17:48.534 --> 17:51.515
Well, looks like somebody
got bored doing it.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.346
Washington's the only one
with any clothes,

17:55.508 --> 17:58.182
and they're just kind of roughed in.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.385
Lincoln doesn't even have an ear.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.926
Okay, we've seen it.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.401
Dad?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.166
Dad?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.780
Come here.
Oh, Jesus.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.420
Oh, Dad.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.822
I'm fine.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.692
Go back to bed.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.825
All right, sir.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.665
Are you hanging with me?

19:20.760 --> 19:21.932
Mmm.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.003
Let me know if I'm hurting you, bud.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.307
Mmm.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.113
Don't worry about it. Almost done.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.526
All right, sir.
That ought to pretty much do it.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.124
You did great.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.838
Give me a second.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.413
Where's my teeth?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.374
You lost your teeth?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.556
Did you leave them at the motel?

20:14.647 --> 20:15.751
No.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.326
The tavern?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.260
I wasn't in no tavern.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.120
Did you leave them
at the place where they serve alcohol

20:22.154 --> 20:24.065
that you don't call a tavern?

20:25.157 --> 20:27.899
Must have been when I fell by the tracks.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.765
Gentlemen,

20:31.864 --> 20:33.775
thank you for your patience.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.573
Considering
it's a pretty bad head wound,

20:35.668 --> 20:37.511
his age, his confusion,

20:37.570 --> 20:38.947
and his history of drinking,

20:39.038 --> 20:40.711
I really think we should
keep him in the hospital

20:40.773 --> 20:42.184
a day or so for observation.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.686
I don't drink.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.416
You hear that, Dad?

20:45.511 --> 20:47.787
We won't be making Lincoln by Friday.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.521
We have until Monday.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.459
We're going to take you back home.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.722
I'm not going home.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.765
No, I can't wait until Monday.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.758
That means I wouldn't be
back at work until Wednesday.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.803
Selling record players.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.739
I won a million dollars.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.599
Congratulations.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.576
That will just about
pay for a day in the hospital.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.744
Dad.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.213
Dad.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.551
Dad.

21:21.046 --> 21:24.118
Hey, I looked,
but I couldn't find your teeth anywhere.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.559
They're by the tracks.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.293
Listen, Mom talked to
Uncle Ray and Aunt Martha,

21:29.388 --> 21:32.733
and they're going to put us up
in Hawthorne over the weekend.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.066
I don't want to go to Hawthorne.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.733
There's no sense going to Lincoln
over the weekend.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.640
I will get you there Monday morning.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.178
Anyway, Aunt Martha said
she'd invite all your brothers over

21:42.268 --> 21:44.305
and have a little get-together on Sunday.

21:44.403 --> 21:47.316
Mom's coming down on the bus,
maybe Ross and Marcie, too.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.612
It'll be nice.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.919
I don't want to go to Hawthorne.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.443
Oh! Okay! Dad, I found it!

22:15.434 --> 22:16.777
Here it is!

22:20.439 --> 22:22.851
Oh, wait. This isn't yours.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.717
I was kidding. Here.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.025
These ain't mine.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.360
Of course they're yours.

22:36.455 --> 22:37.525
No.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.367
Whose else is it going to be?

22:39.458 --> 22:41.369
- See if it fits.
- They're not my teeth.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.530
They have to be.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.665
I ought to know my own teeth.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.074
Of course they're my teeth.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.549
Don't be a moron.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.200
Well, hello there, boys!

25:01.300 --> 25:03.211
- Hey, Aunt Martha.
- Hi.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.309
Woody!

25:05.938 --> 25:07.178
Martha.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.384
Davey!

25:14.847 --> 25:15.951
Look at you, Davey.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.619
You couldn't have been more than 15

25:17.683 --> 25:19.162
the last time you were here.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.458
That was what I was saying to Dad.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.362
It's been a long time.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.695
Well, what do you got to
say for yourself, Woody?

25:24.790 --> 25:25.825
Nothing.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.393
What did you do to your head?

25:27.493 --> 25:28.631
Fell.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.972
You Grant brothers
sure are men of few words.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.474
Come on in.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.853
Look who I found
hanging around out front, Ray.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.149
Your little brother, Woody.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.224
What's up, Woody?

25:51.016 --> 25:52.256
Nothing.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.063
How about you?

25:55.821 --> 25:57.528
Not much.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.034
Hi, Uncle Ray.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.102
You have a latrine?

26:02.194 --> 26:04.697
Uh, around the corner, to your left.

26:07.766 --> 26:10.406
You boys remember your cousin David?

26:10.736 --> 26:12.113
- Bart.
- Hey.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.873
- Cole.
- Hey.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.586
It's been a long time
since we all met as kids.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.348
What are you guys up to?

26:18.544 --> 26:20.023
Not much.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.218
This economy has just
tore up Hawthorne, Davey.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.020
Things are hard for young men.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.462
Yeah, I'm in the home theater

26:27.553 --> 26:29.897
and electronics business myself.

26:29.955 --> 26:32.265
It's a rough time, I'll tell you that.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.565
Cole, here, did some jail.

26:38.964 --> 26:40.739
Don't bring that up.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.375
Bitch lied through her teeth.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.779
I will not have
that language in my house.

26:45.871 --> 26:46.872
Sorry, Mom.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.545
Now, Davey, you sit down.
You must be starving.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.281
I made sandwiches.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.263
So, how long did it take you to get here?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.460
I don't know. Uh...

27:04.556 --> 27:06.763
We got sort of waylaid in Rapid City.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.465
That's where Dad had his little accident.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.565
But how long, total?

27:10.629 --> 27:11.630
Um...

27:11.730 --> 27:13.471
A couple of days, I guess.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.408
- From Billings?
- Yeah.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.969
How far is that?

27:17.069 --> 27:20.642
It's probably about, uh, 750 miles.

27:21.507 --> 27:24.511
It took you two days to drive 750 miles?

27:25.077 --> 27:27.489
What were you driving,
a dump truck or something?

27:29.014 --> 27:31.688
It's a Subaru. Outback.

27:31.783 --> 27:33.854
Hell, I drove up from Dallas one time.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.761
That's 850 miles.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.923
I done that in eight hours.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.828
That's, like, over 100 miles an hour.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.871
Oh, Bart was moving.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.307
Here you go, Davey. Dig in.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.538
Thank you.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.778
Shit, two days from Montana.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.044
Son of a bitch must have
been driving in reverse.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.954
Ray's foot's been bothering him.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.999
Ain't that right, Ray?

28:09.121 --> 28:10.964
It's okay. Just hurts.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.502
Did you get that, Dad?

28:16.461 --> 28:18.065
- Dad?
- Huh?

28:18.830 --> 28:20.673
Uncle Ray's foot hurts.

28:20.732 --> 28:21.972
I know.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.579
Everything else good, though?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.681
Uncle Ray?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.051
Not really.

28:32.744 --> 28:35.054
Kate says they got Ross
on the news out there.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.683
Says he's doing real good.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.421
Yup. Yeah, he's doing great.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.497
Well, good for him.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.055
He always was a go-getter,
wasn't he?

28:43.155 --> 28:44.225
Yup.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.529
Two goddamn days from Billings!

30:01.099 --> 30:03.340
I used to own this garage.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.950
Own it? I thought
the air compressor guy did.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.245
Ed Pegram?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.581
Yeah, I thought he owned it.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.279
We were partners.

30:11.743 --> 30:12.915
Oh.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.580
What happened?

30:14.746 --> 30:16.248
Sold it to him.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.858
For how much?

30:17.949 --> 30:19.451
$800.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.666
- You need something?
- Oh, hi, yeah.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.833
My dad, here, used to own this place.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.433
Oh, yeah?

30:38.603 --> 30:40.810
What you fellows got going on, here?

30:40.872 --> 30:43.785
Oh, we're just replacing
a transmission cooler line.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.020
- You know Ed Pegram?
- Who?

30:47.112 --> 30:48.455
Ed Pegram.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.515
Used to own this place with me.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.036
We don't know him.

31:03.628 --> 31:04.629
Hey, bud.

31:07.065 --> 31:08.544
You're using the wrong wrench.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.670
Come on, Dad. Let's get going.

31:11.236 --> 31:12.738
Good talking to you.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.541
Moron was
using the wrong wrench.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.319
Let's see if I know anyone in here.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.739
It's pretty quiet in here.

31:50.942 --> 31:53.684
Hi, fellas.
What can I get for you today?

31:54.045 --> 31:55.080
Beer.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.683
Okay, what kind of
beer would you like?

31:58.049 --> 32:00.689
Anything's fine.
Coors, if you got it.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.194
I'll have a Mountain Dew.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.756
Okay, we're out of Coors.

32:03.855 --> 32:06.233
The truck doesn't come in until Monday.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.731
Bud's good.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.773
Bud and a Dew, coming up.

32:09.861 --> 32:12.034
Tom Varnik still own this place?

32:12.097 --> 32:14.304
I don't remember that name.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.877
It must have been before my time.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.612
Here we go, guys.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.389
Anything else I can get
for you right now?

32:26.411 --> 32:27.412
No, ma'am.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.652
Okay, holler if you need something.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.060
I used to know everyone in here.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.326
It's where you had your first drink?

32:36.421 --> 32:37.627
No.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.066
Dad used to let me sip his beer.

32:40.659 --> 32:41.660
So, I guess you kept up that

32:41.760 --> 32:44.400
fine family tradition with Ross and me.

32:45.764 --> 32:47.766
You liked it, as I recall.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.571
I was, like, six.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.775
A sip of beer ain't going to kill you

32:51.837 --> 32:53.441
when you're six years old.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.246
I thought you drank.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.786
Come on.
Have a beer with your old man.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.822
Be somebody.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.753
I've been trying to give it up.

33:04.749 --> 33:05.989
What for?

33:07.586 --> 33:09.588
It was starting to...

33:09.654 --> 33:11.497
It just wasn't helping.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.925
And now you're all right.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.667
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.437
Can I have a beer, too, please?

33:21.500 --> 33:22.604
You betcha.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.943
I'm going to drink with my dad.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.706
I didn't tell you that
Noel and I broke up.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.208
Who?

33:58.303 --> 33:59.475
Noel.

33:59.704 --> 34:03.049
The girl I've been living with
for the past two years.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.516
She moved out.
We broke up.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.485
Oh.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.826
Maybe I should have
asked her to get married. I don't know.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.190
I just...

34:15.920 --> 34:18.492
I just never felt sure,
you know what I mean?

34:22.994 --> 34:25.940
How are you supposed to know
when you're sure?

34:26.031 --> 34:27.339
Were you sure?

34:28.433 --> 34:29.503
Huh?

34:29.833 --> 34:32.610
How did you and Mom
end up getting married?

34:33.538 --> 34:35.210
Oh, she wanted to.

34:35.273 --> 34:36.877
And you didn't?

34:38.009 --> 34:39.886
I figured, what the hell.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.788
Were you ever sorry
you married her?

34:44.916 --> 34:46.554
All the time.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.362
Could have been worse.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.860
You must have been in love.
At least, at first.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.094
Never came up.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.910
Did you ever talk
about having kids?

35:03.969 --> 35:05.949
How many you wanted
and stuff like that?

35:06.037 --> 35:07.482
Nope.

35:08.306 --> 35:10.047
Then why did you have us?

35:10.408 --> 35:12.115
Because I like to screw.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.587
And your mother is a Catholic.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.556
So, you figure it out.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.285
So, you and Mom never
actually talked about

35:18.383 --> 35:20.158
whether you wanted kids or not?

35:20.251 --> 35:21.958
I figured if we kept on screwing,

35:22.053 --> 35:24.465
we would end up with a couple of you.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.334
Did you ever think
about leaving her?

35:29.427 --> 35:31.498
Oh, I would just end up
with somebody else

35:31.596 --> 35:33.303
who would give me shit all the time.

35:33.398 --> 35:34.968
Yeah, you would.

35:35.233 --> 35:36.473
Yeah.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.674
I'd say she's put up
with your drinking all these years.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.579
I don't drink that much.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.953
- You're an alcoholic.
- Bullshit.

35:44.009 --> 35:46.421
Oh, what do you mean, "bullshit"?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.822
I knew you had a problem
when I was eight.

35:48.913 --> 35:51.257
I used to watch you hide
your booze in the garage.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.422
Yeah, you stole it, too.
I figured it was you.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.599
You cost me a lot of money.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.826
Yeah, I poured it out

35:58.923 --> 36:01.164
because I was sick
of seeing you drunk all the time.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.294
I figured it was you.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.361
You would never catch your brother

36:03.461 --> 36:05.372
sneaking around like that.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.204
I served my country.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.005
I Pay my taxes.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.674
And I got a right to do

36:10.769 --> 36:12.806
whatever the goddamn hell I want.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.612
So, I guess you do drink.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.283
- A little bit.
- A lot.

36:17.642 --> 36:18.950
All right.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.455
So, I drink a lot!

36:20.512 --> 36:22.514
God damn it, so what?

36:22.614 --> 36:25.117
You do what you want to do, and so do I.

36:25.350 --> 36:28.695
You would drink, too, if you were
married to your mother.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.563
And it ain't your job
to tell me what to do,

36:32.657 --> 36:34.330
you little cocksucker.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.807
Dad.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.040
Dad.

36:47.839 --> 36:48.874
Dad!

36:48.973 --> 36:50.316
What?

36:53.845 --> 36:56.348
Should I take you back
to Ray and Martha's?

36:57.015 --> 36:58.426
I don't know.

37:44.362 --> 37:47.434
Say, don't you
owe me a couple of bucks?

37:48.900 --> 37:51.881
Christ Almighty, it's Woody Grant.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.410
I don't believe it!
How the hell are you, Woody?

37:56.040 --> 37:59.647
God, I never thought
I'd see you back in Hawthorne.

38:01.079 --> 38:03.821
Fellas, say hello to my
old friend Woody.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.262
Hello, Woody.

38:06.384 --> 38:07.328
Yeah!

38:07.418 --> 38:10.297
Move over. Move over.
Sit down, sit down.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.801
I don't believe this.
Jesus Christ, Woody.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.234
So, how you been?

38:16.594 --> 38:17.971
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

38:18.062 --> 38:20.064
Me, too. I can't complain.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.801
Boy, it's been a long time, Woody.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.073
A long time.

38:24.602 --> 38:26.411
Hi, I'm David, Woody's son.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.006
Oh. Ed Pegram.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.683
Ed Pegram?

38:29.908 --> 38:32.184
Davey? Oh, no shit.

38:33.077 --> 38:34.317
How you doing, guy?

38:34.412 --> 38:36.756
You know, the last time I saw you,
you was just a little shaver.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.523
I used to give you candy bars
down at the garage

38:39.617 --> 38:41.153
when you were about this high.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.253
Thank you.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.460
And apparently, my dad used to
give you air compressors.

38:45.924 --> 38:46.994
How's that?

38:47.158 --> 38:48.193
Nothing.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.170
Hey, Dad,
I'm going to the bathroom.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.207
Don't say
anything about the money.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.435
Huh?

38:53.598 --> 38:55.771
Don't say anything about the money.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.672
You still living up in Billings?

38:59.771 --> 39:00.943
Yeah.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.985
What brings you down here?

39:03.041 --> 39:05.146
I'm just passing through.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.473
Goddamn, Woody
Grant is a millionaire!

39:28.533 --> 39:29.841
Who would have thought it, huh?

39:31.636 --> 39:33.673
The next round is on Woody.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.001
Come on, Dad.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.916
Did you see the look
on their faces?

40:17.015 --> 40:18.460
Yeah, I saw.

40:21.619 --> 40:24.600
Did you see the look
on those fellas, faces?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.254
Well, good morning, boys.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.458
Slept in a little late, did you?

41:29.520 --> 41:30.590
Morning.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.192
Davey, get yourself
a chair from over there.

41:33.424 --> 41:36.200
And Woody, you sit right on down here.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.103
Right there, yeah.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.708
Hungry?

41:45.803 --> 41:48.943
Yeah, but it would be great
if you have some, uh...

41:50.608 --> 41:51.780
Some coffee.

41:53.444 --> 41:56.482
Got a call from
Lowell Meyerson this morning.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.551
And Mary Jurak.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.453
Woody, here,
is the talk of the town.

42:02.286 --> 42:03.731
Is that right?

42:03.821 --> 42:06.995
Why didn't you tell us
you was rich, Woody?

42:07.058 --> 42:08.366
David said not to.

42:08.459 --> 42:09.733
He's not rich.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.634
You could have told us the real reason

42:11.696 --> 42:12.902
you were coming through town.

42:12.997 --> 42:14.806
We're just tickled for you.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.409
You got it on you?

42:16.501 --> 42:17.844
Yeah, we sure would like to see

42:17.902 --> 42:20.041
what a million dollars looks like.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.709
We still got to go to Lincoln to get it.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.253
Goddamn, you hit the Powerball!

42:25.343 --> 42:27.152
Whoo!

42:27.311 --> 42:29.188
Show us the ticket, Uncle Woody.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.557
Honestly, he didn't win anything.

42:31.749 --> 42:33.057
I didn't win anything.

42:33.151 --> 42:34.596
I don't blame you, Woody.

42:34.685 --> 42:36.926
I wouldn't broadcast it either.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.659
Not until I had it in the bank.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.504
You have to watch out for buzzards, too.

42:43.428 --> 42:45.499
Bart and me, we can drive you.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.564
Sure.

42:46.664 --> 42:48.735
We could get you to Lincoln in an hour.

42:48.833 --> 42:50.779
Lincoln is over 200 miles.

42:51.202 --> 42:54.547
Okay, an hour-and-a-half.
How long would it take you?

42:55.173 --> 42:56.254
A day-and-a-half.

42:56.274 --> 42:59.016
Must be nice,
winning that kind of scratch.

42:59.343 --> 43:01.516
We're real proud of you, Woody.

43:01.846 --> 43:05.419
And I know Ma and Pa
would've been real proud, too.

43:08.352 --> 43:10.798
Hell, yeah, it must be nice.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.561
Is it nice, Dad?

43:14.425 --> 43:15.699
Is what nice?

43:15.760 --> 43:17.706
Winning all that money?

43:18.729 --> 43:20.936
Yeah, pretty nice.

43:36.781 --> 43:39.057
Hey there, Woody. Remember me?

43:39.650 --> 43:42.062
Bernie Bowen, how you doing?

43:43.488 --> 43:44.728
Pretty good.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.564
That's what I hear.

43:46.724 --> 43:49.796
Everybody's saying
how Woody Grant's a millionaire.

43:49.894 --> 43:53.273
Well, that's the most exciting news
around here for ages!

43:53.397 --> 43:54.774
It's no big deal.

43:54.832 --> 43:56.402
No big deal?

43:56.501 --> 43:59.573
Jeez! There's a guy
living the life of Reilly.

43:59.737 --> 44:01.842
A million here, a million there.

44:01.939 --> 44:04.920
Oh, the newspaper's gonna
do a big write-up on you.

44:05.243 --> 44:06.745
I'm gonna get my
picture in the paper?

44:06.811 --> 44:08.290
You bet you will.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.082
Dad, here's the bus.

44:11.349 --> 44:14.853
Okay. Well, good seeing
you then, Woody.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.656
We're all real happy for you

44:16.754 --> 44:18.995
and real pleased you thought
to stop back home

44:19.090 --> 44:20.433
and share the big news.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.970
Thanks, Bernie.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.439
Hey, watch your wallet!

44:46.951 --> 44:47.952
Thank you.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.327
You're welcome.

44:51.122 --> 44:52.965
You both look like hell.

44:53.024 --> 44:54.059
I'm fine.

44:54.158 --> 44:57.332
Like hell, you are.
You look like an old drunk.

44:57.562 --> 44:59.473
You're lucky you're not dead.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.873
I haven't been drinking!

45:00.965 --> 45:03.639
That's what you said on our first date!

45:04.068 --> 45:06.844
And you.
Have you gone bananas?

45:07.071 --> 45:08.709
Almost getting your father killed

45:08.806 --> 45:11.343
over some cockamamie pot of gold.

45:11.475 --> 45:13.477
Mom, come here, please.

45:15.313 --> 45:18.021
Mom, look.
Go easy on the guy, okay?

45:18.516 --> 45:19.859
I mean, you and I both know

45:19.917 --> 45:21.692
that this is not about the money.

45:21.752 --> 45:25.598
It's about, you know, how much
longer is he going to be around?

45:25.690 --> 45:27.499
At least, semi-coherently.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.765
What's the harm in letting
him have his little fantasy

45:29.860 --> 45:31.601
for just a couple more days?

45:31.696 --> 45:34.836
You and Ross, always
fretting over your father.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.537
What about me?

45:36.767 --> 45:40.112
What about taking me out
to see my sister in Eau Claire?

45:40.204 --> 45:42.081
Your father doesn't
even know what the hell's

45:42.173 --> 45:44.346
going on around him half the time.

45:44.408 --> 45:45.944
Do you, Woody?

45:46.877 --> 45:47.878
Do I what?

45:47.945 --> 45:50.255
Know what's going on around you?

45:51.415 --> 45:55.261
You watch it,
or that's what you're gonna turn into.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.399
Now, take me out to the cemetery.

45:57.455 --> 45:59.628
I want to pay my respects.

45:59.724 --> 46:01.124
Martha said she'd have lunch ready.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.762
Martha can wait.

46:05.863 --> 46:07.035
Mom.

46:07.531 --> 46:08.874
Car's over there.

46:40.998 --> 46:43.103
There's Woody's mother, Sara.

46:43.901 --> 46:45.175
She hated me.

46:45.269 --> 46:46.509
She wanted him to marry someone

46:46.570 --> 46:47.810
who would milk the cows.

46:47.905 --> 46:50.010
I said, "I ain't fiddling
with no cow titties.

46:50.107 --> 46:51.916
"I'm a city girl."

46:53.744 --> 46:56.122
The good Lord did not
do Sara any favors

46:56.180 --> 46:58.182
in the looks department.

46:58.749 --> 47:01.457
More a man's face
than a woman's, really.

47:04.021 --> 47:05.591
How did she die?

47:05.656 --> 47:08.193
Saw herself in
the mirror one day.

47:09.694 --> 47:10.968
No.

47:11.262 --> 47:12.468
Cancer!

47:13.698 --> 47:16.440
And there's the old Swede, Tolf.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.709
Good man, your grandpa.
Never said much.

47:20.771 --> 47:22.717
That farm just ruined him.

47:25.443 --> 47:28.151
You're lucky I took you away from there.

47:29.447 --> 47:31.825
And there's Woody's brother, David.

47:31.882 --> 47:33.884
You were named after him.

47:35.119 --> 47:38.828
He died of scarlet fever
when he was only two.

47:40.391 --> 47:43.804
Woody slept in the same bed
with him and never got it.

47:47.732 --> 47:50.235
There's Woody's little sister, Rose.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.814
She was only 19

47:52.870 --> 47:55.874
when she was killed
in a car wreck near Wausa.

47:57.174 --> 47:58.653
- What a whore.
- Mom...

47:58.709 --> 48:01.815
No, I liked Rose.
But, my God, she was a slut.

48:02.146 --> 48:04.820
- Come on.
- I'm just telling you the truth.

48:05.483 --> 48:08.760
She was screwing guys
in the back of Hawthorne Creamery

48:08.853 --> 48:10.526
when she was only 15.

48:10.588 --> 48:12.659
Come on, Mom. Jesus.

48:15.159 --> 48:16.365
Where's your family?

48:16.427 --> 48:18.907
Oh. They're over
in the Catholic cemetery.

48:18.996 --> 48:20.737
Catholics wouldn't
be caught dead around

48:20.831 --> 48:23.209
all these damn Lutherans.

48:23.934 --> 48:27.006
Here's Delmer, Woody's cousin.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.244
He was a drunk.

48:29.440 --> 48:33.013
One time, we were wrestling,
and he felt me up.

48:33.411 --> 48:34.617
Grabbed a handful of boob,

48:34.712 --> 48:36.953
and Woody was right there
and didn't have a clue.

48:37.047 --> 48:38.890
- Did you, Woody?
- Jesus, Mom.

48:43.187 --> 48:44.860
Well, my goodness.

48:45.556 --> 48:48.196
I didn't know Keith White was here.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.697
When did he die?

48:51.695 --> 48:53.106
Keith White.

48:53.197 --> 48:57.441
He wanted in my pants,
too, but he was so boring.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.075
See what you could've had, Keith,

49:03.140 --> 49:06.087
if you hadn't talked
about wheat all the lime?

49:13.484 --> 49:14.554
Oh!

49:14.952 --> 49:17.228
Peggy Huntsucker is pregnant.

49:17.555 --> 49:19.125
Peggy got knocked up again?

49:19.223 --> 49:21.225
- Yeah.
- At her age?

49:21.459 --> 49:23.461
That old cow must be 50.

49:23.561 --> 49:25.302
She just looks 50.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.740
That's what pig farming will do to you.

49:39.243 --> 49:41.280
So, you got any other cars?

49:42.079 --> 49:43.752
No, just that one.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.586
What's the engine?

49:46.650 --> 49:48.926
It's a four-cylinder.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.599
Yeah, but what size?

49:52.156 --> 49:54.158
Oh, I don't really know.

49:55.125 --> 49:56.502
What's your brother drive?

49:56.594 --> 49:58.005
Who, Ross?

49:58.095 --> 50:00.769
Yeah. What does he...
What does he drive?

50:00.931 --> 50:03.275
Ross has a Kia Rondo,

50:03.334 --> 50:06.213
and Marcie has a Nissan Pathfinder,

50:06.637 --> 50:09.174
because she carts the kids around a lot.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.942
So, you all got Jap cars?

50:12.009 --> 50:13.989
Actually, Kia is Korean.

50:28.959 --> 50:31.565
Hey, is this where I can
find Mr. Woody Grant?

50:31.962 --> 50:33.464
Who wants to know?

50:34.198 --> 50:35.802
Um, I was sent by Mrs. Nagy

50:35.866 --> 50:38.642
at the <i>Hawthorne Republican</i>
to take his picture.

50:40.971 --> 50:42.211
Yeah, he's here.

50:42.306 --> 50:43.478
And they want him to be sure

50:43.541 --> 50:45.919
to drop by the office for an interview.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.290
Hello?

51:29.853 --> 51:31.059
Hello!

51:34.858 --> 51:35.928
Yes?

51:36.026 --> 51:37.630
Hi, are you Mrs. Nagy?

51:37.728 --> 51:38.763
Yes.

51:38.862 --> 51:41.069
I'm David Grant, Woody Grant's son.

51:41.131 --> 51:44.374
Oh! I'm very pleased to meet you.

51:44.868 --> 51:48.042
Your father is certainly
quite the celebrity around here.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.109
That's what I came to tell you about.

51:50.207 --> 51:53.279
Dad didn't win any lottery,
or sweepstakes, or anything.

51:53.377 --> 51:56.256
He's a little confused
about something he got in the mail,

51:56.313 --> 51:58.384
and it's gotten way out of hand.

51:58.749 --> 52:00.660
So, he didn't win a million dollars?

52:00.751 --> 52:02.094
No, ma'am.

52:02.386 --> 52:05.629
It just goes to show you,
some things never change.

52:05.823 --> 52:08.064
He was always a little confused.

52:08.492 --> 52:10.301
Oh. You knew my dad?

52:10.761 --> 52:12.399
It's ancient history now,

52:12.463 --> 52:14.101
and I don't want to speak out of turn,

52:14.164 --> 52:16.906
but Woody and I used to go together.

52:17.401 --> 52:18.471
You were his girlfriend?

52:18.569 --> 52:20.071
That's right.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.480
What happened?

52:21.572 --> 52:23.677
Your mother is what happened.

52:23.907 --> 52:25.113
How is Kate?

52:25.576 --> 52:27.419
Fine. She's here, too.

52:27.578 --> 52:30.081
You tell her Peg Bender says hello.

52:30.414 --> 52:32.690
Okay. She won't slap me, will she?

52:33.684 --> 52:35.595
Why would she? She won.

52:37.254 --> 52:39.097
It's water under the bridge.

52:39.256 --> 52:42.328
Don't get me wrong,
I married a wonderful man.

52:42.793 --> 52:45.797
We ran this newspaper
together until he died.

52:46.030 --> 52:49.443
Had three children, eight grandchildren.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.507
I've got no complaints.

52:54.371 --> 52:56.282
Was Woody drinking back then?

52:56.874 --> 53:00.378
Of course he was.
It happens early around here.

53:00.611 --> 53:03.023
There's really not much else to do.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.688
Nowadays, of course,
ifs not just the booze,

53:05.783 --> 53:07.524
but all the other stuff.

53:07.618 --> 53:10.121
For Woody,
it got bad after Korea.

53:10.487 --> 53:12.467
He had a hard time over there.

53:13.123 --> 53:14.659
I thought he was just a mechanic.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.966
He was, for the army planes.

53:17.161 --> 53:19.732
But he was shot down,
being transferred.

53:20.731 --> 53:22.574
You knew that, right?

53:52.096 --> 53:53.507
Thank you.

54:10.013 --> 54:11.515
Oh. Here it is.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.685
- Woody, Ray and Albert.
- Wow!

54:18.021 --> 54:20.467
Wow, they look like kids.

54:20.858 --> 54:23.429
Your dad was never much of a talker,

54:23.527 --> 54:27.031
and when he came back,
he hardly said a word.

54:27.598 --> 54:29.805
But always very kind.

54:30.367 --> 54:32.074
People took advantage of him.

54:32.136 --> 54:34.616
He just couldn't turn down a favor.

54:36.140 --> 54:37.949
Now that everyone thinks
he's a millionaire,

54:38.041 --> 54:39.952
he's a big hero around here.

54:40.043 --> 54:42.649
Well, I'm sorry I can't
print that he is,

54:42.746 --> 54:45.249
but I won't print that he isn't, either.

54:45.716 --> 54:48.253
I'll just do a little story
on him and Kate

54:48.318 --> 54:50.127
stopping through town.

54:50.220 --> 54:52.131
It's hard to imagine
you and my mother

54:52.222 --> 54:54.099
fighting over the same man.

54:54.158 --> 54:56.229
I knew I didn't have a chance,
anyway.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.397
Yeah?

54:57.461 --> 54:59.964
I wouldn't let him round the bases.

55:22.519 --> 55:26.160
You say go slow

55:26.590 --> 55:28.797
<i>I fall behind</i>

55:30.093 --> 55:31.936
What are you having, old man?

55:32.429 --> 55:33.703
Meatloaf.

55:33.931 --> 55:36.639
You've been staring at that
menu for 10 minutes.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.139
Where does it say "meatloaf"?

55:39.803 --> 55:41.009
They ought to have meatloaf.

55:41.104 --> 55:43.778
Well, they don't, so pick something else.

55:44.708 --> 55:46.016
Are we ready to order?

55:46.109 --> 55:47.383
Oh, I knew it.

55:47.477 --> 55:49.718
Dad, do you know
what you want?

55:50.714 --> 55:52.352
Do you have meatloaf?

55:52.449 --> 55:53.894
No, I'm sorry, we don't.

55:53.984 --> 55:56.021
That's only on the lunch buffet.

55:56.453 --> 55:57.625
Chicken, then.

55:57.688 --> 55:58.962
Do you want the fried chicken,

55:59.022 --> 56:01.298
or the flame-broiled chicken breast?

56:01.358 --> 56:03.964
- Fried.
- He'll have the flame-broiled.

56:04.328 --> 56:05.807
And for you, ma'am?

56:05.863 --> 56:08.207
I was thinking about
having the roast beef,

56:08.298 --> 56:09.834
but now I'm not sure.

56:09.900 --> 56:12.540
What do you recommend?
What's good here?

56:12.669 --> 56:15.843
It's all good, but I'm kind
of partial to the tilapia.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.542
No, I want the roast beef.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.481
I'll have the tilapia.

56:21.812 --> 56:22.984
Don't forget to help yourselves

56:23.046 --> 56:24.389
to the soup and salad bar.

56:28.819 --> 56:31.823
<i>On a cold and gray
Chicago morning</i>

56:31.889 --> 56:35.769
<i>A poor little baby child
is born in the ghetto</i>

56:37.861 --> 56:39.602
That's Ed Pegram singing.

56:39.696 --> 56:42.677
<i>And his mamma cries</i>

56:44.835 --> 56:47.679
<i>'Cause if there's
one thing that she don't need</i>

56:47.738 --> 56:50.412
<i>It's another hungry
mouth to feed</i>

56:50.507 --> 56:52.214
<i>In the ghetto</i>

56:55.212 --> 56:57.522
<i>People don't you understand</i>

56:58.448 --> 57:00.758
He always did have a nice voice.

57:00.884 --> 57:03.421
It was the only nice thing
about that bastard.

57:03.520 --> 57:05.591
- He's all right.
- "All right"?

57:05.689 --> 57:07.259
Did you know that he was always

57:07.357 --> 57:09.030
trying to get in my bloomers?

57:09.092 --> 57:10.093
Jesus, Mom.

57:10.193 --> 57:12.366
Was the whole town
trying to seduce you?

57:12.429 --> 57:13.965
These boys grow up

57:14.064 --> 57:16.874
staring at the rear ends
of cows and pigs.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.777
It's only natural that a real woman

57:18.869 --> 57:20.780
will get them chafing their pants.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.282
Mom, please don't talk about

57:22.372 --> 57:23.942
that kind of stuff right before we eat.

57:24.041 --> 57:27.887
You were always
such a sensitive boy.

57:28.211 --> 57:30.248
And such a beautiful boy.

57:31.081 --> 57:32.788
Why, when you were a baby,

57:32.883 --> 57:34.624
people used to stop me on the street

57:34.718 --> 57:37.221
and tell me how beautiful you were.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.897
A lot of them thought you were a girl.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.830
Isn't that right, Woody?

57:42.059 --> 57:43.504
I don't know.

57:43.593 --> 57:44.901
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

57:44.962 --> 57:46.339
<i>I have an announcement to make.</i>

57:46.430 --> 57:49.070
<i>We have a celebrity
in our midst this evening.</i>

57:49.132 --> 57:50.736
<i>My good friend and the rich man</i>

57:50.801 --> 57:52.644
<i>you've all been hearing about...</i>

57:52.736 --> 57:54.443
<i>Mr. Woody Grant!</i>

57:54.504 --> 57:55.812
<i>Stand up and take a bow, Woody.</i>

57:59.009 --> 58:00.818
- Stand up, Dad.
- Huh?

58:00.911 --> 58:03.289
Don't encourage this nonsense.

58:03.347 --> 58:05.850
Dad, stand up. Stand up, it's for you.

58:05.949 --> 58:08.156
Just do it and get it over with.

58:14.191 --> 58:16.694
<i>Take a bow, Woody!</i>

58:17.027 --> 58:18.267
<i>Hey!</i>

58:35.645 --> 58:38.148
Okay, you ham, that's enough.

58:39.116 --> 58:40.686
<i>Roslyn, you're going to be getting</i>

58:40.784 --> 58:43.287
<i>a big tip from that table tonight.</i>

58:50.460 --> 58:51.700
Hey, little Davey!

58:51.795 --> 58:52.865
Hello, Mr. Pegram.

58:52.963 --> 58:54.704
I was hoping I'd run into you.

58:54.798 --> 58:56.072
Oh, yeah?

58:57.401 --> 58:59.074
What can I do for you?

58:59.169 --> 59:02.707
I just wanted you to know,
I think the world of Woody.

59:03.473 --> 59:04.747
Always a good man.

59:04.841 --> 59:05.842
Thank you.

59:05.909 --> 59:07.411
Heart of gold.

59:07.644 --> 59:09.248
Uh, it's no secret, though...

59:09.346 --> 59:12.190
He drank quite a bit
when we had the garage,

59:12.249 --> 59:13.819
and he messed up a lot of jobs,

59:13.884 --> 59:15.921
and let lots of money walk.

59:16.319 --> 59:19.493
He was older than me.
Kind of like a big brother.

59:19.556 --> 59:21.536
Korea vet, the whole nine yards.

59:21.591 --> 59:24.003
And I wanted to show
him some respect,

59:24.061 --> 59:26.234
so I loaned him a ton of dough,

59:26.329 --> 59:28.240
and I never saw it again.

59:30.333 --> 59:33.075
So, seeing as how
he's come into some cash lately,

59:33.170 --> 59:34.581
some no-fooling-around cash

59:34.671 --> 59:36.673
that he didn't even have to work for...

59:36.740 --> 59:40.552
It seems to me only
fair if we settled up.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.785
So, you want your $800 back.

59:45.682 --> 59:47.855
Woody owes me a lot more than that.

59:48.518 --> 59:49.678
I'm sorry to break it to you,

59:49.719 --> 59:51.960
but my dad didn't win anything.

59:52.055 --> 59:54.035
It's all a big misunderstanding.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.594
You know Woody,
you can understand that.

59:56.693 --> 59:58.900
Right, so you're all
headed down to Lincoln

59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.602
to visit the roller skating museum, huh?

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.871
Look, Davey,
I really don't want to have

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.436
to bring a lawyer into this.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:06.570
Lawyer?

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:10.985
What's the statute
of limitations on bullshit?

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.782
Davey, Davey.

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:18.456
I'm a man with a real strong
sense of right and wrong.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:22.223
And if Woody hit it rich
and I don't see any of it

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.295
that would be wrong.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:26.834
And I will make it right.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.400
Are you threatening my family?

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:35.603
Threatening?
No, that would be wrong.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.307
Hey, I'm the victim, here.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:43.248
It's just food for thought.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.948
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.114
I've got to take a leak real bad.

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:50.789
You know beer,
you just rent the stuff.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.035
Great to see you again, Woody.
We're real happy for you.

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:09.110
Buy a boat and go fishing.
That's what I'd do.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:10.937
I just might.

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.714
David, you probably don't remember

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.840
Kathy and Dale Slaasted.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.480
- Oh, David.
- Hi. How are you?

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:19.850
David Grant.

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:22.947
I never would've recognized you
in a million years.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.289
You were such a beautiful little boy.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.828
I keep telling him.
You see?

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.530
Like a little prince made
out of porcelain.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.621
Thank you.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.395
Well, you all take care.

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.333
Oh, and enjoy spending the loot.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.030
Enjoy.

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:43.535
I just had an
interesting conversation

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.044
with Ed Pegram in the men's room.

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:46.341
What did he want?

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:47.905
Some of Dad's money.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.914
I can loan him a couple bucks
if he's hard up.

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:53.317
Like hell, you will.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:27.217
Hey, you. Wake up!

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.248
Wake up. Now.

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:33.055
What's up, Dad? What's wrong?

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.255
Are we going to Lincoln today?

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:36.626
Tomorrow.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.256
Why not today?

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:41.098
Today is Sunday.
Lincoln is closed.

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.138
And all your brothers are
coming over today. Remember?

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.865
Some of them are dead.

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:48.298
The dead ones won't be here.

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.103
Oh.

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:52.943
But God damn it.

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:54.208
If I don't get to that money,

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.649
they're gonna give it to somebody else.

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.719
Hey, Dad.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.622
Do you remember a gal
you used to go out with

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.420
named Peg Bender?

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:07.723
- Who?
- Peg Bender.

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.297
I don't know. When?

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.296
Last week.
What do you mean, "When"?

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.562
Years ago, before you were married.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.835
It was a long time ago.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:22.442
What are you bringing that up for?

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.144
Snap to Cutler.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.948
<i>Back on five, tight pocket.
Throws it over the middle,</i>

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.181
batted up in the air by <i>Aromashodu.</i>

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.120
<i>He makes the grab
and a first down to midfield.</i>

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:38.659
<i>Left to the 45. Leaping to the 40.</i>

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:41.922
<i>Hit hard from behind
to the Lion 38-yard-line.</i>

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.596
<i>Great hands!</i>

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.929
<i>Devin Aromashodu batted it to himself,</i>

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.832
<i>and it's a first down to the Bears.</i>

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.370
I didn't see your boys out there, Martha.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.201
Where are Cole and Ban?

01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:55.940
Oh, they're out volunteering today.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.844
Picking up trash,
out on the highway.

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.676
They'll be home in time for supper.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.010
That's nice.

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:05.314
It's community service,
on account of Colds rape.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.115
Sexual assault, not rape.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.483
Well, what's the difference?

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.184
There's a big difference.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.318
Cole can explain it better than I can.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:15.021
And Bart doesn't have to be there.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:16.688
He's volunteering.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.390
Oh, that's nice!

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.469
<i>Bears come
out for their third possession.</i>

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.798
Hey, for a limited time,

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.840
<i>Ruth's Chris Steak House
is offering Ruth's Classic.</i>

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.307
Verne, do you still drive a Chevy?

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.673
A what?

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:34.240
A Chevy.
That Impala you used to have.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.041
I never had an Impala.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.152
Well, hell, I don't know
what it was, then.

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.730
I had a Buick.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.661
That's what it was.

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:54.830
Are you still driving that?

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.030
I haven't had that for years.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:59.564
I thought you still had it.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.211
It was a '78, wasn't it?

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:07.908
'79.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.585
'79.
Those were good cars.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:14.686
It was okay.

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:18.058
They don't make them like that anymore.

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.389
Those cars will run forever.

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.597
Whatever happened to it?

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:27.562
It stopped running.

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.466
Well, they'll do that.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.139
Hello!

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.607
Come in!

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.476
Oh. Hey, everybody.

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.372
Hi, Ross.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:44.585
How about Marcie and the kids?

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.310
Uh... Dance recital.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.986
Who's playing?

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:53.256
Chicago and Detroit.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.563
How long did it take you to drive?

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.635
So, Uncle Woody, did you get over

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.644
and talk to the newspaper yet?

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:14.412
Not yet.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.111
They sent a kid around
to take my picture.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.515
I went by the office
and gave them the lowdown.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.356
What's it like being
a millionaire, Woody?

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:29.792
It's okay.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:33.760
A million dollars.
Can you beat that?

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:37.260
Let's raise a glass
to Kate and Woody, here.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.965
To Kate and Woody!

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:44.172
Not to be a spoilsport,

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:47.180
but you all know this is bull.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.606
I mean, Dad didn't win anything.

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:51.141
Nice try, Ross.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:53.050
Yeah, we're way beyond that.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.315
Ross is right. He didn't.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.851
Trying to keep it quiet,
so everybody don't come around

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:00.052
looking for a handout, huh, Kate?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.556
That's good thinking.

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:02.857
No, that's right.

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:04.522
Woody ain't no millionaire yet.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.498
We all got to remember that.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:09.503
But come tomorrow,
that's a different story.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.203
What's the first thing you're going to do

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:13.330
with the money, Woody?

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.205
The very first thing.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.142
Get a truck.
And a compressor.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.314
What the hell are you gonna
do with a compressor?

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.875
I need it to paint.

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:27.250
Are you still working, Woody?

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:29.546
No.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:32.684
He just needs to replace the
compressor that Ed Pegram stole.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:34.660
Why don't you just
go down and get it from him

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.253
while you're in town?

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:37.557
Huh.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:39.495
David, let's go get it.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.763
You boys will do no such thing.

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:45.197
Get yourselves shot
for an old piece of garbage?

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.935
Am I the only sane one in this family?

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:50.002
Okay, Mom. Fine.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.772
But, hey, Ross,

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.588
I was thinking we could
take a drive later,

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.081
and see Dad's old house.

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:56.775
The old Grant house.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.250
Do you think it's still there?

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:01.686
Dan Conway farms the place,
but he never tore it down.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:02.946
It's still sitting there.

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:05.890
Why would you want
to waste your time seeing that?

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.293
Must be filled with rats.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.258
Dad, want to take a drive later

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:12.230
and see the old homestead?

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:13.557
The what?

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:16.462
David and I want to go see
where you grew up.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.300
What for?

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.886
What's Uncle Albert doing?

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:44.456
He's watching cars go by.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.928
Remember when they came out
to visit when we were kids,

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.799
and he'd take a chair
out in the front yard

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:51.098
every evening to watch the road?

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:52.734
Oh, yeah.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.241
Hi, David. Hi, ROSS.

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:58.975
It sure is good to see you boys again.

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:02.180
We just can't let
this much time pass again.

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:04.475
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thanks, Aunt Betty.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.645
It's great seeing you again, too.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:08.413
But there is something,

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.617
and it's kind of hard to bring up.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.988
We feel it deserves mentioning.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.322
What's that?

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.256
Well...

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.694
Well, you may not know it,

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.529
but Woody always had
a lot of money problems,

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:24.764
and the family would help him out
from time to time.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.665
So, in light of his good fortune...

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:30.536
Well, we thought your family might want

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:32.670
to make things right.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.046
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:36.707
You know, Cole's and my folks

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.548
would never say nothing
if it was just for them,

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.814
but they're gonna need
in on this deal, too.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:44.381
Are you saying
you want money from us?

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.460
Oh, we just figured, seeing as how

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.689
the family took care of Woody and all,

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:50.560
and kept him on his feet.

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.689
Verne and I loaned Woody quite a bit,

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.666
and it wasn't like we was rich.

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:56.362
But he was my brother-in-law,

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.871
and we couldn't stand
to see the family suffer.

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.531
Look, Aunt Betty,

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.975
and, guys, hey,
for real, honestly, right?

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:05.844
Woody didn't win anything.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:07.677
This is a total sham.

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:09.645
You're a damn liar!

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.913
Don't feed us any
of your bullshit, Ross.

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:13.817
You want to go?

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.716
Let's do it!

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:18.815
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:23.224
Hey, watch my face, okay?
I'm on TV.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.828
Get him, Bart!

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:31.665
What's going on?

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:34.504
Have you boys lost your minds?

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:39.109
Aunt Betty and her henchmen here
are asking for reparations.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.269
For what?

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.280
They're after Dad's "winnings." Right?

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.180
They say we owe them money.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.742
See? There is money.

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:47.253
"Owe them money?

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.113
What on Earth are you
talking about, Betty?

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.723
Now, Kate, you know
we helped you and Woody out

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:55.285
when he was drinking up
everything he earned.

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:58.263
You know as well as I do
it was the other way around.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:01.426
You were always having
him work on your cars for free,

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:02.901
getting free gas.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:05.963
Aunt Kate, we're not
asking for much. Just a token.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:07.598
I kept records.

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:09.140
The money you gave him

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:11.644
didn't come close to what you owed.

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.941
He couldn't say "no" to anybody,

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.379
and it ruined him.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.311
I think you're having
a senior moment, here, Kate.

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.250
Just where do you think
that money come from

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.947
when you got a bee
in your bonnet

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.650
to move up to Billings
and open up that salon?

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:28.126
From my folks when they croaked,
that's where!

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.231
I don't believe the nerve of you people.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.960
Usually a person has to die

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.228
before the vultures start circling.

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:38.631
Calm down, Aunt Katie.
We didn't mean nothing by it.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:40.173
We was just doing you a courtesy

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:42.174
before we go talk to Woody direct.

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:44.506
Don't you dare think about asking

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.409
that poor man for money.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.073
He ain't poor.
He's rich.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:51.016
Even if he was, he wouldn't
give you a blessed penny.

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:53.018
I'd put my foot down!

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:55.316
Maybe it ain't up to you,
Aunt Kate.

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.856
That's enough.

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:59.081
You listen real good.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:01.584
You can all just go

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.759
fuck yourselves!

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:07.098
Boys, get your dad.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.091
What do you think, old man?

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.893
Looks about the same.

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:47.599
That's true.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.227
This is about how your mother kept it.

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:56.768
My dad built this place.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.572
Really?

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:01.712
Wait. You don't mean,
by himself?

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:04.211
Yeah. Before I was born.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.983
His brothers helped.

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.255
I got it, I got it.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.427
This was my room.

01:14:56.792 --> 01:15:00.171
That's where
Woody's brother David died.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.269
Do you remember that, Dad?

01:15:05.935 --> 01:15:07.312
I was there.

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:44.485
This was my parents' room.

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:49.983
I'd get whipped if they found me in here.

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:56.062
I guess nobody's gonna whip me now.

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:10.536
The barn is still standing.

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.434
Have you seen enough?

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:41.607
I suppose.

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:45.742
It's just a bunch of old wood
and some weeds.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.612
Did you ever want a farm like your dad?

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.919
I don't remember.

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.628
And it doesn't matter.

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.912
Oh, there's the O'Hara farm.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:28.248
She's dead.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.813
He's in a nursing home in Valentine.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:33.951
And one of their little brats
still lives there.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:42.100
Oh, and there's Ed Pegram's
place on the right.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.675
What are you doing?

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:50.370
Let's do it.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:51.942
We're right here.

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.805
What are you boys up to now?

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.377
Hey, Dad, don't you want to see

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.475
if he still has your compressor?

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.270
Will you two knock off this foolishness?

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:51.459
Hey, Dad, you finally
got your compressor back.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.397
That's not my compressor.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.268
Sure it is.

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.465
Mine didn't look anything like that.

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.337
It... It has to be yours.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:05.344
It's an old compressor
we found in Ed Pegram's barn.

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.841
That wasn't Ed's barn.

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.580
What are you talking about?

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.983
That's the Westendorf place.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:14.918
Oh, that's right.

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:17.087
Right, the Westendorfs.

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:20.822
The Pegrams live closer to town.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:23.021
Oh, I got confused.

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:24.990
Ed and his wife Dorothy.

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:26.998
God, what a pig she was.

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.362
Anything you want to say
about the Westendorfs?

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.370
No, they're good folks.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.167
They had some tough times.

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:37.172
They lost a child.

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:38.836
Almost went broke,

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:41.471
but they worked hard
and saved the farm.

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:43.710
Salt of the Earth,
the Westendorfs.

01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:47.219
They really didn't deserve
what you boys did to them.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:50.384
Dad, why didn't you tell us
that wasn't Ed's house?

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:52.959
I didn't know what the
hell you were doing.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:55.621
Have you ever seen us
steal machinery before?

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.354
Well, I never know
what you boys are up to.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.157
Well, why didn't you say it wasn't yours?

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.230
I thought you wanted it.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.737
What do we want an
old compressor for?

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:08.636
That's what I couldn't figure out.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:22.978
Hi, George.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.546
Hi, Jean.

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:27.376
Remember us?
Kate and Woody Grant?

01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:29.221
Oh, sure. How you doing?

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:30.780
Just fine.

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:34.326
We were passing by
and thought we'd stop in.

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.322
Haven't been in Hawthorne
for a long time.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:40.099
Well, what are you doing
in the back seat?

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.228
Uh...

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:47.004
We were just resting back here
until you showed up.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.065
You want to come in for a visit?

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:54.437
Sorry, we just have time
to say hi and get going.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.415
Hi there, Woody.
How you doing?

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:01.287
Good, George.
How about yourself?

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.289
Getting by.

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.325
You still up there in Montana?

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:06.415
Yep.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.961
Billings, isn't it?

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.591
That's right.

01:23:09.852 --> 01:23:12.162
You still fixing hair out there, Kate?

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:14.695
No, I let that go.

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:16.802
Oh, you did.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.444
Well, good to see you folks.

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:31.012
I'd better get up front
and drive us back to town.

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.386
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:36.512
Call us sometime.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:38.489
I will. Bye-bye.

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:55.341
Bye-bye.

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.836
You were right, Mom.

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.777
The Westendorfs look
like real nice people.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.505
I tried to tell you.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:33.911
What do you want to do now,

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.949
bust into a silo and
steal some corn?

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:40.347
- Let me drive.
- No, I'll drive.

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:06.809
What time do you figure
we'll be shoving off in the morning?

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.408
I think 8:00 sounds about right.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.279
You want another beer?

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:13.944
I suppose.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.113
Hey there, Davey-boy,
make some room.

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.452
How's it going, cowboy?

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:21.494
Well, it was going fine.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:23.554
Woody.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:25.393
Ed.

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:28.099
Well, enough of this chit-chat,

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:30.227
ifs time to get down to business.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.294
Woody, I tried to tell your boy

01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:36.467
that you wouldn't mind
using some of your winnings

01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:39.609
to even the score with your old pal Ed.

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:42.281
Well, how much you need?

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:43.907
I got a 20.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.479
A 20?
No, no, no.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:49.954
No, no. I was thinking more
along the lines of, say...

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:51.616
10 grand.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.418
Give him 10 grand, Dad.

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.485
I don't got it yet.

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:56.654
Woody...

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.462
I always thought we was friends.

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:03.300
Remember, I was the one
that convinced you to stay with Kate.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:06.496
Oh, yeah, Davey.
Your dad wanted to get a divorce

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:09.166
because he was screwing
some half-breed down at the reservation.

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:11.039
He thought he was in love.

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:13.010
Ain't that right, Woody?

01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:22.183
When was this, Dad?

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.955
After Ross was born. Before you.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.741
You know, if I hadn't been around,

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:28.294
you might not even be here.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.455
Back then, divorce was a sin.

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:32.499
Nowadays, I guess it's okay.

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:35.125
God must have
changed his mind or something.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.804
Although, I really didn't
blame you, Woody,

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.535
because Kate was... Was always a bitch.

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:45.203
Get the hell away from us.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.506
I want that money.

01:26:46.568 --> 01:26:47.706
Move.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:49.841
Okay, little Davey.

01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:52.145
Have it your way.

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:55.885
But, uh, this is the last time

01:26:56.178 --> 01:26:58.749
that old Eddie-boy is
gonna play nice.

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:35.522
I got it! I got it!

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.429
Dad, are you okay?

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.431
They took my letter.

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:06.990
Hey, David.

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.483
Where is it?

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:09.960
Where's what?

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.621
Just give it back.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.496
I don't know what
you're talking about, buddy.

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:15.966
Cole, do you know?

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.559
Of course not.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.505
Where is it?

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:25.069
We don't got it.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.908
Shut the fuck up, Cole!

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:30.907
We tossed it when we saw
how bogus it was.

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:33.510
A millionaire? What a joke.

01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.281
You people are pathetic.

01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:05.985
I won't mention any of
this to Mom or Ross.

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.815
We'll just tell them that
you came to your senses,

01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:11.186
and we'll head back home.

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:12.622
Sound good?

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:15.521
It's okay.

01:29:15.617 --> 01:29:18.029
At least we had
a little change of scenery.

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:21.066
And I'm happy that
we got this time together.

01:29:21.156 --> 01:29:22.499
Aren't you?

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:31.639
Maybe they dropped it.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.475
Should we go have a look?

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:55.191
I think it was easier
to find your teeth.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.545
Hey, Dad.

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:09.509
Let's take a break.

01:30:25.687 --> 01:30:27.928
Now, just imagine what you could do

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:31.095
with one million dollars,
Woodrow.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:33.194
But we all know what
the son of a bitch would do.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.537
He'd buy a truck.

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.434
Oh.

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.409
"To collect your prize

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:40.946
"you just have to return this letter

01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:44.609
"to our office, along with
your winning prize number

01:30:44.706 --> 01:30:49.985
"and a list of the magazine
subscriptions you would like."

01:30:50.078 --> 01:30:53.389
Oh, hey there, Woody!
I was just looking for you.

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:55.922
Somebody found your
precious sweepstakes notice

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:57.395
out on the street.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:59.132
You better take better
care of this, Woody.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.097
You wouldn't want
to lose it again.

01:32:34.983 --> 01:32:36.690
Dad, what's the matter?

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:37.889
I'm dizzy.

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:40.364
Okay. Let's get you to a doctor.
Come on.

01:32:40.822 --> 01:32:42.665
Get me back to the house.

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:44.527
We're going to Lincoln in the morning.

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:46.094
No, we're not going to Lincoln.

01:32:46.194 --> 01:32:47.673
Yes, we are.

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.105
No. Come on.

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:50.938
Let me sit down a minute.

01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:57.009
Okay.

01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:04.918
Dad, this is it, okay?

01:33:05.013 --> 01:33:07.050
This is where it stops.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:09.892
Your head is busted open,

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:12.056
and now you can barely stand up.

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.893
You promised.

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:15.263
You didn't win!

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:17.734
Okay? Can't you get
that through your head?

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:20.295
And we're not driving down to Lincoln

01:33:20.395 --> 01:33:22.272
over a stupid fantasy!

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:25.641
It's my own damn fault
for taking you this far.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.608
You've got enough money to get by.

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.051
You can't drive.

01:33:35.577 --> 01:33:37.113
What's the point?

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.255
I want a new truck.

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:42.554
Why do you need a truck so bad?

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:44.588
Just to have it.

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:47.397
I always wanted a brand-new truck.

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:49.899
Well, what about the
rest of the money?

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:53.132
You don't need a million dollars
for a damn pickup truck.

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.903
It's for you boys.

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.745
I wanted to leave you something.

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.614
We're fine, Dad.

01:34:10.912 --> 01:34:12.482
We don't need it.

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:17.453
I just wanted to leave you something.

01:34:27.095 --> 01:34:31.271
You know if there was
any chance you won, I'd take you.

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:33.268
You know that, right?

01:34:34.102 --> 01:34:35.877
I wouldn't lie to you.

01:34:36.271 --> 01:34:37.511
I know.

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:41.619
Look, the only reason
I agreed to take you to Lincoln

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.986
was to get out of Billings for a while,

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:46.457
and maybe have some time with you.

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:48.656
And to get you to shut up.

01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:51.620
All right.

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:53.355
All right, what?

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.324
I'll shut up.

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:59.468
And what about Lincoln?

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.169
We don't have to go.

01:35:04.132 --> 01:35:05.475
Good.

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.014
Dad! Dad.

01:35:47.008 --> 01:35:48.180
Hey.

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:50.578
So, they can keep him here

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.885
until tomorrow afternoon or so.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:56.386
And then I guess
we'll just start driving home.

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.220
We'll probably see you Tuesday night.

01:35:58.286 --> 01:36:00.926
Okay. Thanks, David.

01:36:01.289 --> 01:36:03.064
Mom and I will head out
early tomorrow morning.

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:04.432
I have to get back, so...

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:07.131
And I'm gonna have
to listen to him harp

01:36:07.228 --> 01:36:10.437
about losing his fortune
for the rest of his life.

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:12.272
Or my life.

01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:14.911
He's gonna bury me at this rate.

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.461
You big idiot.

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:47.642
You want this open or closed?

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.442
Might as well close it.

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:14.468
Dad?

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.065
Wait, Dad. Dad.
You can't go in like that.

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:30.302
Come on, you have
to get your robe off.

01:39:30.398 --> 01:39:32.139
Here. Come back here.

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.128
Hi. Can I help you?

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:51.288
Hi.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.428
My father is here to
collect his million dollars.

01:39:55.523 --> 01:39:57.434
Dad, give me the letter.

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:20.285
I'm sorry, your number wasn't
one of the winning numbers.

01:40:21.983 --> 01:40:23.792
Looks like you didn't win.

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.330
But it says I won.

01:40:25.386 --> 01:40:27.195
It says you won if your number

01:40:27.288 --> 01:40:29.529
is one of the winning numbers.

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:33.797
I'm sorry, sir.

01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:36.302
I hope you guys didn't
have to come too far.

01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:37.866
Montana.

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:39.171
Oh, my.

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:43.414
Well, Dad, I guess that's it.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.378
I can give you a free gift,

01:40:47.475 --> 01:40:49.648
like a hat or a seat cushion.

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:52.549
You want a hat or
a seat cushion?

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:53.981
Huh?

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.161
Do you want a hat
or a seat cushion?

01:40:58.719 --> 01:40:59.823
A hat.

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:02.162
He'll take the hat.

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:28.291
Does this happen a lot?

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:30.760
Yeah. Every once in a while.

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:33.896
Usually older people
like your father.

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:36.435
Does he have Alzheimer's?

01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:39.061
He just believes stuff
that people tell him.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:41.195
Oh. That's too bad.

01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:42.869
Yeah.

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:45.633
Thank you.

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.586
Dad?

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:02.788
Dad.

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:06.064
I'm here.

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.264
We're going back
to Billings, okay?

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:10.563
Okay.

01:42:18.933 --> 01:42:22.073
We might make
a couple quick stops first.

01:42:22.637 --> 01:42:24.139
Whatever you want.

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:53.043
I don't understand
what's happening with your car.

01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:57.613
Well, they made me
a real good offer for it.

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:02.218
It's not much of a car.

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:05.353
Yeah, this truck is a real step up.

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:09.119
It's only five years old.
It's practically brand-new.

01:43:11.819 --> 01:43:14.390
Oh, and I hope you don't mind...

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.527
I put your name on the title.

01:43:23.998 --> 01:43:26.137
My name is on the title, you say?

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.908
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to let me drive it.

01:43:30.805 --> 01:43:33.342
You work out something
with the prize people?

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.081
Yeah.

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:38.914
They were willing to go
as far as the truck.

01:43:39.013 --> 01:43:40.390
Come on, get in.

01:45:18.746 --> 01:45:21.158
Okay, Dad,
it's your turn to drive.

01:45:24.118 --> 01:45:25.961
You said I couldn't.

01:45:26.921 --> 01:45:28.457
Just drive it down Locust Street.

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:31.025
It's only a few blocks.
There's no traffic.

01:45:33.594 --> 01:45:34.937
Come on.

01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:37.500
It's your truck.

01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:11.033
Hey, there!
Looking good, Woody!

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:12.126
Get down.

01:47:12.226 --> 01:47:14.263
- What?
- God damn it! Get down!

01:47:16.297 --> 01:47:18.072
Looking good!

01:48:41.949 --> 01:48:43.656
So long, Albert.

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.461
So long, Woody.
