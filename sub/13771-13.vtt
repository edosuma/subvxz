WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.568
Mm, good dinner, honey.

00:03.655 --> 00:05.788
Thanks. I'm stunned I
had time to cook anything.

00:05.875 --> 00:08.095
Traffic was horrible, and then
on the way to the market,

00:08.182 --> 00:09.096
I hit a possum.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.140
You're kidding.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.402
It was just awful.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.230
It laid there
moaning and dying.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.884
I didn't know what to do.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.364
So I finally
called Animal Services.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.192
Waited and waited,
nobody ever came.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.977
I was so upset. I never did
have time to get to the store.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.894
If you never made
it to the store,

00:24.981 --> 00:26.026
then what are we eating?

00:28.985 --> 00:30.508
Something from the freezer.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.989
Finish it.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.071
I'll pick up Dewey
from his piano lesson.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.463
And you're waiting for
the drywall guy?

01:12.550 --> 01:14.030
Yeah, but you got
to get the vacuum.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.162
I'll take the boys
for their haircuts,

01:15.249 --> 01:16.598
and go pay the phone bill.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.121
All right. By the way,
the dermatologist called.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.514
He said that the lump
on my back is just...

01:19.601 --> 01:21.472
MALCOLM: Don't put it out
with more fire, moron!

01:21.559 --> 01:22.865
Oh, my God.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.867
-[Jamie crying]
-Oh! Oh.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.045
[loud crash]

01:29.132 --> 01:31.439
[Jamie crying]

01:31.526 --> 01:34.485
I don't care if it's
only a little poisonous.

01:34.572 --> 01:35.878
Get rid of it.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.402
So he said it was just
an ingrown hair.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.012
-What?
-The lump.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.145
Oh, good.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.842
That was 18 hours ago.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.409
That's the last time
we talked to each other?

01:45.496 --> 01:47.933
Oh, my God.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.501
I mean, oh, my God.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.069
We talk to each other
20 seconds a day?!

01:53.156 --> 01:54.636
Don't worry, honey.

01:54.723 --> 01:57.465
This is a problem,
but I will take care of it.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.162
For the next five days,

01:59.249 --> 02:02.426
you boys will be my slaves.

02:02.513 --> 02:07.779
It will be miserable, hard,
exhausting work, but...

02:07.866 --> 02:10.259
Nope, that's it.
Just miserable, hard work.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.480
So no matter what we had
planned or how busy we are,

02:12.567 --> 02:14.482
you're okay with exploiting
us for child labor?

02:14.569 --> 02:16.440
Good, we're clear.
Let's get to work.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.054
Come to Papa.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.317
Dad?

02:23.404 --> 02:25.362
Oh, no, you don't,
Reese. No way.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.234
You give the nail gun
to Dewey.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.974
[scoffs]

02:32.282 --> 02:34.023
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Herkabe?

02:34.110 --> 02:36.199
Malcolm,
one of the many

02:36.286 --> 02:38.375
perks of working in
the glamorous field

02:38.462 --> 02:39.463
of public education

02:39.550 --> 02:40.899
is the constant opportunity

02:40.986 --> 02:42.771
to suddenly increase
your workload.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.555
It's as big
a morale booster

02:44.642 --> 02:46.557
as the constant chiseling
of gum from one's shoes...

02:46.644 --> 02:48.559
You know, you can
come right out and tell me

02:48.646 --> 02:50.039
how you're screwing me over.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.083
You don't have to make
a speech every time.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.824
Be patient.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.262
Yesterday I was informed
that all faculty members

02:55.349 --> 02:57.133
must serve as advisors
to at least one

02:57.220 --> 02:58.482
of the school's many clubs

02:58.569 --> 02:59.788
and organizations.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.573
I've been assigned
the North High Boosters.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.271
And you're telling me
because...?

03:04.358 --> 03:05.533
It's coming.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.969
The Boosters are only

03:07.056 --> 03:09.101
nine members, which
makes it a group.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.103
We need ten for it
to be a club.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.455
And if it isn't a club,
I don't get my $200 advisor fee.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.108
You want me to join?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.633
I love it when a victim
fully grasps the horror.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.461
You have proved a worthy patsy.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.071
I don't want to be
in your stupid club!

03:22.158 --> 03:23.855
It's not a club until
you join. Keep up.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.118
Okay, what's
the blackmail?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.337
[sighs]

03:27.424 --> 03:29.165
Why must you
rush these things?

03:30.122 --> 03:31.820
As Vice Principal,

03:31.907 --> 03:33.691
I write the college
recommendations.

03:33.778 --> 03:34.997
I've written two for you.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.128
One has your

03:36.216 --> 03:37.739
complete academic record.

03:37.826 --> 03:38.914
The other

03:39.001 --> 03:40.568
has your complete
academic record

03:40.655 --> 03:42.918
and a short paragraph about
your personality.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.311
That's not fair!

03:44.398 --> 03:45.877
The meeting starts
at 3:15 tomorrow.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.966
Come early if you want
spirit cookies.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.970
Keep 'em closed.
Almost there.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.363
Hal, you spun me
around 50 times.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.104
I still know we're going
to the garage.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.497
Okay, open 'em.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.761
Oh, Hal, it's...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.763
It's beautiful.
[laughing]

04:01.850 --> 04:03.243
Well, hey, I didn't do it
all myself. The boys

04:03.330 --> 04:04.418
worked their
butts off.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.333
You know,
that's a working wet bar.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.596
And a real New Zealand
Mocking Mask.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.816
Congratulations, boys,
you did a fantastic job.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.471
Now, if you set one foot
in here,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.473
-I will cripple you.
-What?

04:16.560 --> 04:17.735
From now on,
every night

04:17.822 --> 04:19.824
from 6:00 to 7:00
is "tiki time."

04:19.911 --> 04:21.348
"Tiki time" means

04:21.435 --> 04:23.263
your mother and I
will be in here, alone,

04:23.350 --> 04:25.090
with no questions,
no interruptions,

04:25.177 --> 04:28.093
no communication
from you boys of any kind.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.965
Malcolm, you'll cover
any of your mom's shifts

04:30.052 --> 04:31.140
at Lucky Aide.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.707
Reese, Dewey, baby-sit Jamie.

04:32.794 --> 04:33.708
-But...
-No "buts."

04:33.795 --> 04:35.057
You're the ones who ruined

04:35.144 --> 04:36.624
our relationship
in the first place.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.625
Hal...
[chuckling]

04:39.540 --> 04:40.715
He needs changing.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.064
Aloha.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.027
I would like
to officially welcome

04:49.114 --> 04:51.639
my young friend Malcolm
to the North High Booster Club.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.423
It's a very rewarding day
for all of us,

04:53.510 --> 04:55.773
who care so much about...

04:55.860 --> 04:57.775
whatever it is you do.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.516
Phillip?

04:59.603 --> 05:03.041
First, let's review our Food
for the Homeless program. Wayne?

05:03.128 --> 05:04.782
Good news, Boosters,

05:04.869 --> 05:07.350
we raised $428 at our rad
"Bowling For Hobos" event.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.396
[murmuring, applause]

05:09.483 --> 05:12.007
Unfortunately, the decorating
budget got away from us.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.052
We spent $425 on the balloons.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.359
But I think we might be able
to salvage this

05:16.446 --> 05:17.882
by taking that three dollars

05:17.969 --> 05:19.710
and buying the homeless
a really nice card.

05:19.797 --> 05:20.798
-Great idea.
-[murmur of agreement]

05:20.885 --> 05:22.322
Good save, Wayne.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.933
All right, Stephanie,

05:25.020 --> 05:26.282
what about our pancake breakfast

05:26.369 --> 05:28.066
for the Abused Children's
Counseling Center?

05:28.153 --> 05:29.154
It's gonna be awesome.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.504
We have tons of decorations

05:30.591 --> 05:32.375
and hundreds of balloons.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.115
-[murmuring]
-BOY: We can do

05:33.202 --> 05:34.551
such a great job.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.205
Maybe if you eased up
on the balloons,

05:36.292 --> 05:37.989
you'd have some more money
for the counseling center.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.861
I don't think abused children

05:39.948 --> 05:43.343
want to eat in some gloomy,
undecorated room.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.692
I mean, after what
they've been through,

05:44.779 --> 05:46.476
let's not abuse
their sense of taste.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.391
-GIRL: Absolutely.
-[murmurs of agreement]

05:48.478 --> 05:50.001
PHILLIP:
All right, let's move on

05:50.088 --> 05:52.439
to our Monte Carlo Night
for the school library.

05:52.526 --> 05:56.051
This year we've invested in
a professional Bingo caller.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.661
It's going to be insane.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.228
-[murmur of agreement]
-STUDENT: Yes!

05:59.315 --> 06:00.882
And Malcolm?
What? I'm awake.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.536
Don't worry.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.233
We've saved a really
important job just for you.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.104
You are going to be our
Monte Carlo Night auctioneer.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.889
-What?
-That's right.

06:07.976 --> 06:08.977
You're going to be in front of

06:09.064 --> 06:11.283
the whole school
representing us.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.241
[murmuring,
soft laughter]

06:12.328 --> 06:13.938
Welcome aboard, Booster.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.200
[applauding]

06:15.287 --> 06:16.811
[laughs]

06:16.898 --> 06:18.116
GIRL: Malcolm.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.814
Point of order!
Can we start Smile Patrol

06:19.901 --> 06:21.032
before the kids go home?

06:21.119 --> 06:22.512
Smile Patrol?

06:22.599 --> 06:24.166
We thought it'd be fun
to roam the halls

06:24.253 --> 06:25.341
for anyone who's not smiling
and give them a ticket.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.821
[girls giggling]

06:26.908 --> 06:29.127
PHILLIP:
Meeting adjourned.

06:29.214 --> 06:32.261
[indistinct chattering]

06:32.348 --> 06:35.177
I think someone's going to
have to write themselves up.

06:36.831 --> 06:40.312
[ticking, timer buzzing]

06:48.059 --> 06:50.192
[tires squealing]

06:55.502 --> 06:57.329
[door slams,
lounge music plays]

06:57.417 --> 07:00.594
-This is so unfair.
-Yeah, when I grow up,

07:00.681 --> 07:02.813
I'm going to do exactly
the same thing to my kids.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.860
Yeah, mine are going
to pay big time.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.471
By the time I came back,
there were adult diapers

07:08.558 --> 07:09.733
all over the loading dock.

07:09.820 --> 07:10.952
[both laughing]

07:11.039 --> 07:13.520
-That's wonderful.
-[slurping]

07:13.607 --> 07:16.000
Oh, I hear a coconut
that needs refreshing.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.262
One more Beach Frolic

07:17.349 --> 07:18.786
coming up.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.396
So, go on.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.790
I'm finished.
That's my entire day.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.444
Mine, too.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.272
Huh, how about that?

07:27.359 --> 07:29.361
Do you realize
that we have never

07:29.449 --> 07:31.842
told each other
our entire day before?

07:31.929 --> 07:33.061
That's amazing.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.066
I wonder what else
I've never told you.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.372
Think, Lois.
I want to know everything.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.507
I had a pet turtle
named Lee Majors.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.639
He gave

07:45.726 --> 07:47.467
my whole family salmonella.

07:47.554 --> 07:51.253
I thought I loved you
four seconds ago.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.039
I want out of the Booster club.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.432
You can blackmail me
all you want,

07:56.519 --> 07:57.651
but those kids are stupid,

07:57.738 --> 07:59.261
the auctioneer job is stupid,

07:59.348 --> 08:01.481
the whole thing blows,
and I'm quitting.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.831
Someone's putting the "boo"
in "booster."

08:03.918 --> 08:05.659
Did you see the crap
they're trying to auction?

08:05.746 --> 08:07.965
500 take-out menus from
a Chinese restaurant,

08:08.052 --> 08:09.750
an AOL starter disc,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.142
scrapbook lessons,

08:11.229 --> 08:13.449
a 15-minute neck massage
from Earl the janitor.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.842
Nobody wants that stuff.

08:14.929 --> 08:16.060
I'm out of there.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.497
Good for you.
Go right ahead.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.802
What?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.282
I officially stopped
caring at 2:15

08:20.369 --> 08:21.762
when I was handed this check.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.199
And now I can finally
splurge on new brake pads

08:24.286 --> 08:26.593
and treat my Civic
like the lady that she is.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.768
You should really

08:27.855 --> 08:29.030
learn to trust me, Malcolm.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.118
It worked out well
for everyone.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.511
I got my money,
you get to quit,

08:31.598 --> 08:32.903
and the Boosters get
to be rid of you.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.514
What are you talking about?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.602
They don't like you any more
than you like them.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.519
They think you're too lazy and
selfish to be Booster material.

08:40.736 --> 08:41.956
You're lying.

08:43.392 --> 08:47.135
-Oh, my God, you care.
-No, I don't.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.616
They're a bunch of hypocrites
pretending to be into charity

08:49.703 --> 08:51.313
just to have an excuse
to throw parties

08:51.400 --> 08:53.794
and socialize and be
surrounded by balloons.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.447
Is this going to devolve into

08:55.535 --> 08:57.014
you shambling around the quad

08:57.101 --> 08:58.363
come next June desperate

08:58.450 --> 09:00.191
for someone to sign
your yearbook?

09:00.278 --> 09:02.019
Calling me selfish and lazy?

09:02.106 --> 09:04.805
I could raise ten times the
money those idiots ever could!

09:04.892 --> 09:06.458
Please. You're not
seriously thinking of

09:06.546 --> 09:08.025
"showing them a thing or two,"
are you?

09:08.112 --> 09:09.418
Shut up!

09:11.289 --> 09:13.335
Jamie...

09:13.422 --> 09:15.250
come on, just
try it. It's easy.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.774
What are you doing?

09:17.861 --> 09:19.515
He's trying to teach
Jamie to smoke.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.517
Since we're stuck watching
him, I figured we might

09:21.604 --> 09:23.214
as well do something
cool with him.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.129
What's cooler
than a smoking baby?

09:25.216 --> 09:26.653
Why don't you just shoot
him out of a cannon?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.219
Come on, he could be famous.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.265
You know, "Jamie,
that smokin' baby."

09:30.352 --> 09:32.920
He could do talk shows
or tour with rock bands.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.618
But he doesn't even care.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.533
Give him a break.
He's not even two.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.404
I'm not mad that he won't
light the cigarette.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.189
I'm mad that he won't try.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.325
I think he's stupid.

09:47.412 --> 09:50.024
Look, pal,
we missed the chance

09:50.111 --> 09:51.808
to raise you inside
a Sparkletts bottle.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.854
This is our last shot.
We're not going to move.

09:53.941 --> 09:57.074
We're going to sit here
for as long as it takes.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.122
[sniffs]

10:01.209 --> 10:02.427
Aw, man!

10:02.514 --> 10:04.299
You did that on purpose.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.562
You going to play
it that way...

10:06.649 --> 10:07.650
fine.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.260
Now it's war.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.699
LOIS:
I miss the rotary phone, too.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.048
It made you slow down,

10:14.135 --> 10:15.353
think about what
you were gonna say.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.920
Yeah, exactly.
Now it's bup-bup-bup

10:17.007 --> 10:18.705
and there they are
whether you're ready or not.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.358
This is wonderful.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.839
Just think,
when we get to heaven

10:22.926 --> 10:24.885
we'll feel like this
all the time.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.103
Wouldn't that be nice?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.757
What do you mean?

10:27.844 --> 10:31.631
I mean, it would be nice,
heaven.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.241
You mean it will be nice.

10:33.328 --> 10:36.070
[Hawaiian music playing]

10:37.854 --> 10:41.728
I just don't personally...
believe in that.

10:43.251 --> 10:48.169
Well, okay, maybe not the clouds
and the harps and angels,

10:48.256 --> 10:51.433
but you do believe in
some kind of heaven, right?

10:55.350 --> 10:58.005
Okay, so you don't
believe in heaven.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.310
[chuckles]

10:59.397 --> 11:00.834
But you do believe
in some kind of paradise

11:00.921 --> 11:02.705
where our two souls
will go spend eternity?

11:02.792 --> 11:06.187
I'm just not much
of an afterlife person.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.538
Wait a minute, Lois.

11:09.625 --> 11:13.585
Where are good people rewarded
and bad people punished?

11:13.673 --> 11:14.891
Right here on Earth,

11:14.978 --> 11:16.458
if I have anything
to say about it.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.721
How is it I didn't know
about this until now?

11:18.808 --> 11:20.941
Well, I guess we just never
had time to talk about it.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.991
You okay?

11:28.078 --> 11:29.384
Yeah, yeah.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.734
It's silly to ruin
tiki time over this.

11:31.821 --> 11:32.866
I will refresh

11:32.953 --> 11:33.997
our drinks.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.962
Oh, I can't do this!
You've ruined it.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.006
Why?

11:43.093 --> 11:45.182
Because for the last 20 years

11:45.269 --> 11:47.141
I've assumed we'd be
spending eternity together.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.144
And if you don't believe that,
then you won't be there.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.449
Is that the rule?

11:51.536 --> 11:54.409
Nothing about this place
is right anymore.

11:54.496 --> 11:58.239
It feels like that New Zealand
Mocking Mask is... mocking me.

11:58.326 --> 12:01.155
Hal, I didn't say
this to upset you.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.939
-I know.
-Can we talk about it?

12:03.026 --> 12:05.202
I think we've
talked enough.

12:05.289 --> 12:09.076
I'm going to go take kind
of a long walk now.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.165
But you stay.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.949
Enjoy your rum tumbler.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.345
[door shuts]

12:29.923 --> 12:32.926
Look at me playing
with this great toy,

12:33.013 --> 12:34.666
and I'm not gonna share it!

12:34.754 --> 12:37.408
Whee! This is fun!

12:37.495 --> 12:38.540
I'm not gonna turn around.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.584
Is he getting pissed?

12:39.671 --> 12:41.195
He's eating his foot.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.762
Nice cover.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.111
I'm getting to him.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.113
You're having a feud
with a toddler.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.855
And you don't think he's
playing that for all it's worth?

12:50.204 --> 12:52.989
Well, tiki time is over.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.469
You boys don't have
to babysit anymore.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.394
...and Monte Carlo Night
is starting

13:06.481 --> 13:08.178
to shape up really nicely.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.441
We've got really cool-looking
plastic champagne glasses,

13:10.528 --> 13:12.617
and we've also got six-channel
walkie-talkies

13:12.704 --> 13:14.184
so we can be in constant
audio contact

13:14.271 --> 13:16.143
in all sectors
of the gymnasium.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.450
I also took it upon myself
to raise the balloon budget.

13:19.537 --> 13:22.192
I figure if we're not going
mylar, then why even bother?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.150
Okay, great, Victor.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.716
GIRL: Awesome!

13:24.804 --> 13:26.283
All right, and that brings us
to the auction.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.545
It's gonna be horrible,

13:27.632 --> 13:29.069
but not because
I'm not busting my butt.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.114
I've been hitting up people
all around town,

13:31.201 --> 13:33.029
trying to get decent stuff that
people will actually bid on,

13:33.116 --> 13:34.335
but no one's interested!

13:36.163 --> 13:38.600
Well, I'm--I'm sure you're
doing the best that you can.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.037
Meeting adjourned.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.779
[Boosters murmuring]

13:43.866 --> 13:45.825
BOY: That's a "glass
is half empty" outlook.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.044
I can't believe

13:48.131 --> 13:50.612
that this is what happens
when you actually try.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.571
[sighs]

13:55.269 --> 13:56.836
Night.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.405
Why can't we just
get past this?

14:01.492 --> 14:02.667
I don't know.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.191
Why the hell did we think

14:04.278 --> 14:05.801
that talking to each other
was a good idea?

14:05.888 --> 14:07.150
We were having fun
and we got greedy.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.369
Now look at us.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.718
We used
to have no time at all

14:09.805 --> 14:10.588
for each other,
and it worked great.

14:10.675 --> 14:11.938
We should warn people.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.114
Write a book.
Go on  Oprah.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.247
-You know what would help?
-What?

14:17.334 --> 14:18.683
If you changed your mind

14:18.770 --> 14:20.729
and told me
that you believed in heaven.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.600
You want me
to lie to you?

14:22.687 --> 14:24.080
It's not lying
if what you say

14:24.167 --> 14:25.995
would be true
if the facts were different.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.955
I'll work with whatever
you give me.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
If you just say the words,

14:30.782 --> 14:33.133
you'll be giving
me a tiny little gray area

14:33.220 --> 14:35.613
where I can live in peace
for the rest of my life.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.398
I can live in gray, Lois.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.921
Let me live in gray!

14:39.008 --> 14:40.836
Hal, I'm sorry, I have
to tell you the truth.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.229
-Why?
-Because it's what

14:42.316 --> 14:43.273
I believe in.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.754
It's what I hang onto.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.061
The truth is
all that I have.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.237
If I could give
it up for anybody,

14:50.324 --> 14:54.415
I would give it up for
you, but I just can't.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.294
Heaven's going to suck!

15:07.384 --> 15:09.169
HAL:
We have to be home by 9:30.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.779
The babysitter said
her halfway house

15:10.866 --> 15:12.389
goes into lockdown
at 10:00.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.261
Okay. Did she tell you
about the mobile

15:14.348 --> 15:15.784
over Jamie's crib?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.481
She said it looked like
somebody took a saw

15:17.568 --> 15:18.918
and cut almost all the way
through it.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.877
That's weird.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.358
It's not like he
has any enemies or anything.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.535
Hey, Malcolm,
place looks great.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.840
Look at all these balloons.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.407
This is going
to be a fun night.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.974
If watching your son
be humiliated in front

15:32.061 --> 15:33.410
of the whole school
is your idea of fun.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.846
What are you talking about?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.109
You're finally getting
the attention

15:36.196 --> 15:37.110
you always wanted.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.245
Oh, come on, honey.
I know you're upset.

15:42.332 --> 15:43.986
Let's try
to have some fun tonight.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.032
Sure.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.729
If the here and now
is all we've got,

15:47.816 --> 15:50.079
then let's enjoy it
in all its beauty and wonder.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.342
I'll get us some churros.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.303
Hello, Malc.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.739
-Malc?
-Ah, forgive me.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.219
I'm feeling very
odd tonight.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.612
What is it called
when you look around

16:01.699 --> 16:03.745
and you are not filled
with festering rage?

16:03.832 --> 16:05.573
Being moderately happy?

16:05.660 --> 16:08.141
That is it!
I am moderately happy.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.533
I have brake pads,

16:09.620 --> 16:11.361
and enough left over
for a side mirror.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.190
And now I find that there's
a wine tasting booth

16:14.277 --> 16:16.714
with an incredibly
underpriced Riesling,

16:16.801 --> 16:18.194
just 25 cents a glass.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.500
So, if you'll excuse me,

16:19.587 --> 16:21.632
I think I saw a slightly
drunk Ms. Bartlett

16:21.719 --> 16:23.286
headed for the ladies' room.

16:24.461 --> 16:27.160
I can't wait to see the look
on Jamie's face tomorrow

16:27.247 --> 16:28.944
when he tries to tickle
what's left of Elmo.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.902
Then he'll be sorry
he started this.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.949
-[toy gun fires]
-Stupid baby.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.038
Reese, let me ask you.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.345
When you end up
in a situation like this,

16:38.432 --> 16:39.999
does it ever even occur to you

16:40.086 --> 16:42.349
to stop and figure out
how you got there?

16:42.436 --> 16:45.004
And let him win?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.833
I mean, what do you do
when your concept of eternity

16:48.920 --> 16:50.531
is wrapped up in a person

16:50.618 --> 16:52.750
that doesn't believe
in eternity?

16:52.837 --> 16:55.797
I mean, does this
eternity even exist?

16:55.884 --> 16:59.018
You might want to talk
to a senior.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.411
That's it, Mr. Herkabe,

17:01.498 --> 17:02.760
you just broke
the North High bank.

17:02.847 --> 17:05.415
Sometimes you're kissed
by the gods.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.374
Your trip to the corndog cart
has been comped.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.983
I should hope so.

17:10.811 --> 17:11.856
Ladies.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.645
I've been working hard,
and I do care about this,

17:17.732 --> 17:19.038
but all your stuff blows.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.517
Don't worry, Malcolm.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.998
Just go up there
and do your best.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.217
And don't be nervous.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.740
No one's expecting much.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.009
-[feedback squeals]
-Ladies and gentlemen,

17:34.096 --> 17:36.055
it's time for the
Monte Carlo Night auction.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.447
Please gather around.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.930
It's a wonderful night
and a wonderful cause.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.411
I have to say that the members
of the North High Boosters

17:44.498 --> 17:46.935
have really taught me so much

17:47.022 --> 17:49.198
about the true spirit
of charity.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.374
So instead of the items
listed in the program,

17:51.461 --> 17:53.072
we came up
with some new items...

17:53.159 --> 17:54.247

Wow. Over $200 in 30 seconds.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.560
I think we've shown
what the Booster spirit

18:46.647 --> 18:48.257
is really all about.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.873
That is so much money!

Our next item up for bid...

19:28.602 --> 19:30.343

19:31.648 --> 19:34.303
I will let the top bidder
cover my mouth

19:34.390 --> 19:37.132
with duct tape

19:44.879 --> 19:47.577
Well, that was
quite an auction.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.623
Yeah. This was one of
the best nights of my life.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.538
And I actually learned
something about myself.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.540
I was having
this giant conflict

19:53.627 --> 19:55.063
that I thought was
about my principles,

19:55.150 --> 19:56.717
but it was really just
about my own pride.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.763
And all I had to do to
fix it was get over myself.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.158
Excuse me.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.030
BOY: Last call for games!

20:06.117 --> 20:08.076
Ring toss.
Three rings for a dollar.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.643
-MAN: Last chance...
-Hal?

20:09.730 --> 20:13.299
I've changed my mind.
I do believe in heaven.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.563
-I knew it!
[laughing]

20:16.650 --> 20:17.999
Oh, I always knew

20:18.086 --> 20:20.741
you believed in heaven.
[laughing]

20:20.828 --> 20:22.264
Keep the whistle.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.352
I'm good.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.924
Jamie, we need to talk.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.317
I'm calling a truce.

20:31.404 --> 20:32.927
I know you're willing
to keep going

20:33.014 --> 20:35.538
no matter how ugly it gets,
and I respect that.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.627
But I realized something.

20:37.714 --> 20:40.151
Malcolm and Dewey
are both geniuses,

20:40.239 --> 20:41.762
so they're gonna team up
against us.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.633
And since you
and I are both

20:43.720 --> 20:45.548
mentally the same,
we should team up, too.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.202
Otherwise,
they're gonna do

20:47.289 --> 20:48.856
something horrible to us,

20:48.943 --> 20:50.597
and we probably
won't even understand it.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.688
So... here.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.087
Hey, thanks.

21:08.789 --> 21:11.357
Reese, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

21:13.054 --> 21:14.098
What?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.702
