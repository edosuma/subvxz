00:53.516 --> 00:57.593
This is Drago. Where is my fucking package?!

00:57.719 --> 01:02.507
I don't give a fuck about his fucking rules! My rules are "Make the delivery that I fucking paid for!"

01:10.802 --> 01:15.168
You know what? I'm cutting out the middle man, Kagan. Yes, I mean you.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.654
Give me the contact number.

01:34.286 --> 01:37.613
Make me ask you again and I'll cut your throat out.

01:56.142 --> 01:56.892
Yes?

01:56.893 --> 01:58.604
Where is the driver?

01:58.796 --> 01:59.449
I'm sorry?

01:59.450 --> 02:03.969
That piece of shit Kagan set up this deal. It's gone bad. I want you to make it good!

02:03.970 --> 02:05.280
We only deal with Kagan.

02:05.281 --> 02:07.435
Kagan's no longer part of this deal.

02:07.550 --> 02:10.608
I'm the client. Where is the package?

02:10.609 --> 02:14.704
- I'm sorry, sir. The delivery might be behind schedule.
- The delivery was due now!

02:15.610 --> 02:18.533
Excuse me, sir. But I'm doing my best to locate your package now.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.494
Well do better then your best. Find it!

02:22.371 --> 02:26.428
Don't bother tracing the call. My name is Drago Sojic, ask around.

02:26.556 --> 02:30.537
My reputation should encourage your driver to finish this deal.

02:30.802 --> 02:34.398
Transporter. And I'm locating him Mr. Sojic.

02:34.417 --> 02:37.533
For his sake, I hope you locate him before I do.

02:42.532 --> 02:43.974
Come on, Frank. Pick up!

04:43.679 --> 04:46.064
I'm sorry, but the news is not good.

04:46.904 --> 04:50.635
Richard's heart has rejected the third ventricle implant.

04:50.751 --> 04:52.826
The cardiomyopathy is worsening.

04:52.865 --> 04:54.224
What does that mean?

04:54.936 --> 04:59.282
At this point the only chance your son has for survival is a full transplant.

04:59.725 --> 05:00.758
Oh my God!

05:00.950 --> 05:03.787
I should tell you there are many heart donors, Mr. Albinez

05:04.148 --> 05:06.997
Compatible heart is not automatically available.

05:07.190 --> 05:09.371
- We are very high on the waiting list.
- Of course.

05:09.429 --> 05:12.944
Bring Richard back to the hospital tomorrow morning for observation.

05:13.021 --> 05:18.612
When and if a suitable heart becomes available, we will be ready to go into surgery immediately.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.177
- Do you think a heart--
- I can't promise anything.

05:29.010 --> 05:29.990
Ugh.

05:30.660 --> 05:31.718
Do you want books?

05:31.871 --> 05:33.520
Yes. I'll finish animal farm.

05:33.789 --> 05:35.849
They make you read animal farm at school?

05:35.887 --> 05:37.984
It's extra, I finished the other ones already.

05:38.993 --> 05:42.108
I have to be ready for exams if I'm going to Saint Paul.

05:47.753 --> 05:49.504
Dad, we have to keep going.

05:49.946 --> 05:51.815
For mama, she's having a tough time.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.659
She's so afraid, Richard.

05:55.390 --> 05:56.409
To lose you.

05:57.512 --> 05:59.185
No one's losing anyone, papa.

06:05.627 --> 06:07.954
Go. Mom might get annoyed.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.564
You ever think of hiring someone to help you with that?

06:24.641 --> 06:25.985
You know, someone could get hurt.

06:26.620 --> 06:31.155
Look Frank, when you use this equipment for as long as I have, it is an instinct.

06:33.463 --> 06:34.251
Why?

06:36.320 --> 06:37.570
Do I make you nervous?

06:37.839 --> 06:39.904
I'd just hate to see you damage the car.

06:39.962 --> 06:42.350
You take care of the driving, I take care of the cars.

06:43.138 --> 06:43.927
Okay.

06:56.802 --> 06:58.302
Maybe you didn't get all the nuts.

06:58.340 --> 07:01.109
No, of course I got all the nuts. Why do you do this?

07:01.186 --> 07:02.208
Safety first, Dieter.

07:02.209 --> 07:04.747
Ah, look who's talking to me about safety.

07:13.747 --> 07:14.611
Everything all right?

07:14.688 --> 07:16.938
Eh... yeah, yeah. Everything is fine.

07:19.783 --> 07:22.494
Can you pass me this, um... a dolly?

07:23.845 --> 07:25.095
- That one?
- Yeah.

07:26.069 --> 07:29.049
- That one there?
- Yes. Eh... yeah.

07:35.054 --> 07:35.804
Thank you.

07:37.047 --> 07:38.104
Oh my God.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.011
You sure everything is all right?

07:41.012 --> 07:42.186
Yeah, yeah. Fine, fine.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.003
I just check the manifold. Ow.

07:51.294 --> 07:53.217
Eh, could you give me a little push?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.830
Ah, just a little more?

08:01.330 --> 08:02.419
Under the car please.

08:04.137 --> 08:05.253
Yeah, that's great.

08:05.464 --> 08:06.474
I gotta go.

08:06.667 --> 08:07.494
Sure, sure.

08:07.782 --> 08:08.528
See you later.

08:08.972 --> 08:10.262
Don't get up on my account.

08:10.299 --> 08:13.298
Yeah. Like I said, I'll just check the... linkage.

08:13.394 --> 08:14.323
It's not the manifold?

08:14.419 --> 08:15.553
Yes, the manifold.

08:17.629 --> 08:18.976
I was thinking, maybe...

08:20.118 --> 08:22.887
maybe later today I can get a massage. Ease the aches and pains, yeah?

08:23.002 --> 08:25.647
Oh, that sounds like a very good idea for you.

08:26.286 --> 08:28.324
I gotta push off. Thanks for the coffee.

08:28.497 --> 08:29.426
Ah, welcome.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.831
Good luck with the, uh... linkage.

08:31.832 --> 08:32.543
Yeah.

08:35.272 --> 08:36.405
Fuck you.

08:43.076 --> 08:44.999
If I was a bank...

08:45.364 --> 08:47.785
you'd be bankrupt and in jail.

08:48.285 --> 08:52.888
But since I am just an individual person and I have... no rights...

08:53.101 --> 08:55.638
you are allowed to walk free.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.837
So I have to take care of my business however I can.

09:00.183 --> 09:01.857
Which in your case means--

09:05.610 --> 09:06.687
Wait outside.

09:17.738 --> 09:18.796
I'm sorry.

09:19.838 --> 09:20.972
I tried...

09:21.665 --> 09:23.857
I tried everything, but I... I just didn't get better.

09:24.183 --> 09:26.619
No, no. Don't blame yourself. It's--

09:27.503 --> 09:29.426
You're just sick. It's Okay.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.631
There are other treatments, other doctors. You'll see.

09:34.131 --> 09:36.269
I just wanted to come home all this time.

09:37.057 --> 09:38.038
I know.

09:39.677 --> 09:43.311
Lena will take you home. I'll be there shortly. I just have some business to finish.

09:43.388 --> 09:44.446
You're not angry?

09:44.542 --> 09:45.484
Angry?

09:46.134 --> 09:48.115
No, ho-how could I be angry?

09:51.203 --> 09:52.492
I just need a minute.

09:54.853 --> 09:56.684
Oh Filip, my boy.

09:57.372 --> 09:58.737
My precious boy.

10:00.188 --> 10:01.861
I will not let you die.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.611
I promise you that.

10:05.161 --> 10:06.988
I'll do anything. Okay?

10:11.593 --> 10:12.286
Okay.

10:26.116 --> 10:29.981
So... in conclusion to quote Friedrich Schiller...

10:30.520 --> 10:32.707
"It is not flesh and blood.

10:33.418 --> 10:37.496
"A heart, that... makes us fathers and sons."

10:47.394 --> 10:48.067
Sophie?

10:48.068 --> 10:49.260
- Sweetie!
- What?

10:49.261 --> 10:50.356
They have one.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.046
- What?
- They have a heart.

10:54.322 --> 10:55.629
Oh my God.

10:56.624 --> 10:59.181
- Incredible!
- Yes, come down please.

11:00.506 --> 11:02.695
- Oh thank God, I'm on my way.
- Okay.

11:05.501 --> 11:09.679
I used to love to box. But I don't bother with a gym membership anymore.

11:09.695 --> 11:12.204
I make due with what I have!

11:16.353 --> 11:19.776
It saves me money and it's such a good workout.

11:19.795 --> 11:21.987
I'll pay! I've got your money!

11:22.026 --> 11:24.570
At this point, I don't care.

11:31.652 --> 11:32.671
It's happening?

11:32.902 --> 11:35.443
There is a donor. The heart is on it's way.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.257
I'll have a driver there within the hour.

11:37.969 --> 11:41.257
Listen. It's going to be difficult for me to get the heart out.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.170
There is constant supervision.

11:43.448 --> 11:46.410
It's going to be a lot harder for you if you fail.

12:13.544 --> 12:14.698
Almost time.

13:28.209 --> 13:29.440
You the transporter?

13:29.786 --> 13:32.787
You've got to get this to the client as fast as possible. There's no time to lose.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.712
What is going on?

13:49.546 --> 13:50.700
Where's the heart?

14:04.318 --> 14:06.260
How could this happened?!

14:06.394 --> 14:07.625
We don't know yet.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.951
We've confirmed that the heart was placed in the ambulance at the donor hospital.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.987
It must've gone missing somewhere en route.

14:12.988 --> 14:15.714
The-- Isn't someone supposed to be with it the entire way?

14:15.715 --> 14:19.727
Yes. Our technicians were there to supervise delivery. We're trying to figure out what happened.

14:19.728 --> 14:23.689
I can assure you everything is being done to locate the heart. The police are on their way.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.831
How long before the heart is not usable?

14:27.755 --> 14:31.198
The heart can remain viable for only 4 hours at the most.

14:34.926 --> 14:36.926
You better find it before then.

15:03.397 --> 15:04.512
Excuse me?

15:06.317 --> 15:08.893
Uh, are you the father of the young boy?

15:08.913 --> 15:09.605
Yes.

15:09.759 --> 15:11.282
I'm Inspector Tarconi.

15:11.782 --> 15:13.840
I will be in charge of the investigation.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.301
Do you have any leads?

15:15.955 --> 15:17.651
As a matter of fact we do.

15:17.766 --> 15:21.921
1 of the technicians involved with the transfer of the heart has gone missing.

15:22.017 --> 15:26.596
We have set up checkpoints on all major routes into and out of the city.

15:26.942 --> 15:29.672
Inspector. They found the technician.

15:29.826 --> 15:30.980
- He's here.
- Excuse me.

15:36.088 --> 15:39.338
He collected the heart, as scheduled. But it was never delivered.

15:39.511 --> 15:42.136
Apparently he was picked up on his way to the airport.

15:42.137 --> 15:46.985
He claims he was going on vacation, but... the hospital has no record of him asking for time off.

15:50.035 --> 15:51.554
How much time do we have?

15:52.420 --> 15:53.901
Just over 3 hours.

15:55.276 --> 15:57.640
I passed some reporters on my way in.

15:57.641 --> 16:00.247
Yes, the story got out quite fast.

16:00.439 --> 16:02.496
I need you to do me a favor.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.782
I'm... Inspector Tarconi.

16:24.879 --> 16:25.975
Good for you.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.279
You work for this hospital, yes?

16:30.337 --> 16:33.588
A medical technician with access to the transplant team?

16:33.626 --> 16:36.323
Look I already told them, I have nothing to do with this.

16:39.469 --> 16:40.930
What the fuck is this?

16:42.151 --> 16:43.401
Reporters.

16:43.498 --> 16:47.998
When they get a whiff of something like this, it's almost impossible to keep them away.

16:48.036 --> 16:49.363
I will talk to them.

17:08.598 --> 17:10.137
Sorry about that.

17:11.861 --> 17:15.898
Now... um... where were we?

17:15.938 --> 17:17.134
What did you say to them?

17:17.153 --> 17:19.702
I just told them you confessed and...

17:19.703 --> 17:23.952
uh, that you were giving out the names of everyone involved in the plot.

17:24.029 --> 17:26.857
A-are you fucking insane? I didn't say anything like that!

17:26.914 --> 17:30.872
Of course not. But if you're innocent as you claim...

17:30.930 --> 17:35.545
the people responsible... will know immediately that it were just a trick on my part.

17:36.518 --> 17:42.923
Of course I'm in a position to offer protection... for anyone willing to co-operate.

17:49.956 --> 17:51.380
Does he know where the heart is?

17:51.437 --> 17:55.011
No, but he led us to a man who might be able to help.

17:55.684 --> 17:56.432
Who?

17:56.724 --> 17:59.128
Someone... I have dealt with before.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.127
Yes, Inspector?

18:16.377 --> 18:17.724
It's urgent Frank.

18:17.858 --> 18:19.858
I'm afraid I can't really speak now.

18:19.896 --> 18:21.726
Perhaps you have heard it on the news.

18:22.033 --> 18:24.590
A heart was stolen. It was needed for a transplant.

18:24.591 --> 18:25.933
No, I have not heard.

18:25.934 --> 18:30.198
I just arrested a man who confessed to giving the heart to a driver for transport.

18:30.259 --> 18:33.725
He gave a description of the man and his car.

18:33.955 --> 18:35.638
Frank, it matched you.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.079
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.660
Frank you should know that the heart is for a 14 year old boy, very sick.

18:40.795 --> 18:45.844
He will die if this surgery is not carried out... just under 2 hours now.

18:46.432 --> 18:47.336
Frank?

18:47.932 --> 18:49.278
Gotta go, Inspector.

18:50.086 --> 18:50.894
*

18:55.272 --> 18:56.349
Where is the package?

18:56.406 --> 18:57.291
Trunk.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.464
Open it.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.599
What the fuck?

19:13.138 --> 19:13.965
Hey.

19:15.904 --> 19:16.481
Hey!

19:17.039 --> 19:18.904
Let's go, we don't have time for this.

19:22.476 --> 19:25.226
You want the payment? Open the trunk.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.317
Stop with that! Stop with that!

19:42.095 --> 19:43.864
Give me my fucking phone!

19:48.922 --> 19:51.441
You know I don't like it when you come by without calling.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.268
Ah, I was in the neighborhood.

19:54.182 --> 19:56.509
Kagan, what do you want?

19:57.029 --> 19:57.838
What?

19:58.086 --> 20:01.970
If you don't tell me what you're doing here, I'm throwing you out those windows.

20:02.947 --> 20:06.351
We need to talk... about your man.

20:20.391 --> 20:21.545
Get to your point.

20:22.397 --> 20:23.416
I've been thinking--

20:23.455 --> 20:24.647
That's a first.

20:25.034 --> 20:26.091
Lately...

20:26.476 --> 20:29.630
when it comes to these jobs... things have been getting a little...

20:30.034 --> 20:31.322
complicated.

20:31.514 --> 20:34.506
I mean, you gotta admit the body count has been getting a little high.

20:34.621 --> 20:37.864
Self defense, both times. And they were both scumbags.

20:37.865 --> 20:39.562
1 of them was referred by you.

20:39.563 --> 20:41.386
All I'm saying is that...

20:41.482 --> 20:43.424
your boy... he's...

20:43.578 --> 20:45.693
starting to get a... bit of a reputation.

20:45.905 --> 20:46.924
For what?

20:48.610 --> 20:51.187
Oh... let's just call it a...

20:51.360 --> 20:52.994
flair for the dramatic.

20:53.427 --> 20:55.986
The guy is a bullet in a china shop, Carla.

20:56.216 --> 20:57.620
He's making enemies.

21:00.805 --> 21:03.766
Find the transporter, get me the heart.

21:03.959 --> 21:05.709
Then kill that asshole.

21:06.623 --> 21:07.450
Go!

22:16.732 --> 22:17.867
This is Drago.

22:18.156 --> 22:20.944
Where is my fucking package?

22:21.406 --> 22:23.983
You know what? I'm cutting out the middle man Kagan.

22:24.079 --> 22:25.675
Yes, I mean you.

22:34.964 --> 22:36.272
Now what?

22:36.388 --> 22:38.129
What were we just talking about?

22:38.148 --> 22:39.341
What do you mean?

22:39.379 --> 22:40.596
Your man is at it again.

22:40.597 --> 22:41.867
Auggie, what's going on?

22:42.013 --> 22:43.475
Don't say I didn't warn you.

23:03.325 --> 23:06.191
If this heart takes any more than 3 hours to get here, it's not gonna be viable.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.826
Blood pressure's dropping.

23:15.179 --> 23:17.699
This heart's failing, we have to get him in the ER right away.

23:17.776 --> 23:20.199
Get a doctor. Let's go, let's go! Quick.

23:29.354 --> 23:30.720
What... what's happening?

23:30.931 --> 23:33.675
He's in congestive heart failure. They're taking him to the OR.

23:33.695 --> 23:36.730
They need to put him on a cardio pulmonary bypass machine immediately.

23:36.769 --> 23:39.152
But... the new heart hasn't been recovered yet.

23:39.153 --> 23:41.504
I'm sorry, we have no other choice.

24:19.025 --> 24:19.736
Hello?

24:19.939 --> 24:21.246
Have you found him yet?

24:21.554 --> 24:22.477
Yes.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.330
Is he on his way back here?

24:24.811 --> 24:25.753
Not yet.

24:26.196 --> 24:31.850
I-I-I told you, I promise no harm will come to him if he brings me the package. But he needs to bring it to me now.

24:32.396 --> 24:33.356
I understand.

24:33.357 --> 24:34.819
Then why haven't you stopped him?

24:35.425 --> 24:37.098
He doesn't take orders from me.

24:37.156 --> 24:38.526
Le-let's me speak to him.

24:38.527 --> 24:39.901
I don't think that's a good idea.

24:39.902 --> 24:41.972
I-I don't give a shit what you think!

24:42.260 --> 24:44.049
Put me through to him right now!

24:44.452 --> 24:45.702
Let me see what I can do.

24:49.008 --> 24:51.316
*

24:51.701 --> 24:52.316
Carla?

24:52.489 --> 24:56.258
Frank, I just got an angry call from the client, you didn't deliver the package.

24:56.297 --> 24:57.403
You know what it is?

24:58.084 --> 25:00.988
Frank. I thought that wasn't suppose to matter.

25:01.123 --> 25:05.012
It's a human heart... stolen before it could be transplanted into a dying boy.

25:06.201 --> 25:08.527
The client is Drago Sujic.

25:08.566 --> 25:11.691
And you know he's one of the biggest crime bosses in Southern France.

25:11.702 --> 25:14.838
Extremely well connected. Politicians, cops.

25:14.839 --> 25:17.241
I don't give a shit. Why does he need a heart?

25:17.318 --> 25:18.222
I don't know.

25:18.570 --> 25:20.147
Well, find out!

25:33.127 --> 25:34.223
*

25:42.424 --> 25:42.963
Yes.

25:42.964 --> 25:46.230
Drago has a son, 16 years old, born with a heart defect.

25:46.231 --> 25:49.711
His heart has declined for years, now he's in desperate need of a transplant.

25:49.712 --> 25:51.917
So Drago cut to the front of the line.

25:51.975 --> 25:56.746
He built a state of the art operating room in his mansion and hired an entire team of surgeons.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.744
He spent millions on this, Frank.

25:58.821 --> 26:00.743
You expect me to feel something for the man?

26:00.762 --> 26:03.066
You asked me why he needed a heart, I'm telling you.

26:03.239 --> 26:05.039
Kagan referred this job, didn't he?

26:05.173 --> 26:06.987
Let me deal with Kagan, Frank.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.668
Drago is on the other line, he wants to talk to you.

26:10.519 --> 26:11.266
Fine.

26:11.841 --> 26:14.514
Mr. Sujic, you're on with the transporter.

26:14.773 --> 26:15.811
Where are you?

26:16.196 --> 26:18.081
I'm afraid there's been a change of plans.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.905
I was told you make it a point of never changing the deal.

26:21.835 --> 26:24.940
- We'll return your down payment.
- The fuck the down payment!

26:25.151 --> 26:30.619
You have less than 2 hours to bring me the package or I will track you down and I will fucking kill you!

26:36.764 --> 26:37.706
What is it?

26:39.333 --> 26:41.368
The surgeon wants to know if we should wake him up.

26:41.407 --> 26:42.310
What for?

26:43.212 --> 26:44.922
They can only keep him under for so long.

26:44.923 --> 26:46.731
The surgery goes ahead as planned.

26:47.096 --> 26:51.567
Because you are going to put out the description of the driver and the make of the car to the whole organization.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.317
I want eyes on the street.

26:53.394 --> 26:58.490
I want every pimp, every hooker, every dealer that has ever been put on the payroll to be out there looking for this guy.

26:59.010 --> 27:02.067
And as soon as he's found, I want to know about it.

27:25.418 --> 27:26.880
You've got to be kidding me.

28:38.347 --> 28:41.328
- Swedish or deep tissue?
- Ow.

28:41.405 --> 28:44.920
Whatever brings a relief on my back. I can not... withstand.

28:44.997 --> 28:46.808
- Just relax.
- Yeah.

28:46.821 --> 28:49.821
I'm going to fix everything.

28:51.709 --> 28:53.382
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ha.

28:54.074 --> 28:58.765
Here is a little something extra for the... finishing.

28:59.536 --> 29:00.517
The finishing?

29:00.518 --> 29:02.234
The... the ending, um...

29:02.465 --> 29:03.465
you know...

29:03.638 --> 29:05.081
t-to-to make it happy.

29:06.173 --> 29:07.730
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:08.367 --> 29:09.367
Yes, hello?

29:09.465 --> 29:11.258
Dieter, I need a car.

29:11.473 --> 29:12.895
- Uh, when?
- Now.

29:13.069 --> 29:14.992
Aah! Aw!

29:15.261 --> 29:16.165
What the hell was that?

29:16.235 --> 29:18.105
Ah, I get a massage. Ugh.

29:18.201 --> 29:19.548
I hurt my back this morning.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.157
- My back, I cannot hardly-- Aagh!
- Listen.

29:21.158 --> 29:23.491
I don't have time to talk, it's urgent. I need a car.

29:23.503 --> 29:24.465
Aah!

29:24.667 --> 29:25.869
Let go of me!

29:26.037 --> 29:29.133
- You just relax.
- How can I relax when you break my neck?

29:29.171 --> 29:29.961
Dieter!

29:30.095 --> 29:30.941
Yes.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.059
The car.

29:32.232 --> 29:34.011
Where is the one you drive in?

29:34.756 --> 29:35.794
I had a little accident. Aah.

29:35.948 --> 29:36.659
Aah!

29:36.660 --> 29:39.064
- The car ended up in a pool of wet cement.
- Enough! Enough! Ow!

29:39.065 --> 29:41.679
Enough! Aw! Stop this sabotary.

29:41.989 --> 29:42.701
Here.

29:43.605 --> 29:44.989
Go finish yourself!

29:46.156 --> 29:47.098
Dieter.

29:47.213 --> 29:52.317
Frank, I'm sorry. Yes, listen. My back, I can barely move, let alone drive.

29:52.452 --> 29:54.062
All right, forget it, enjoy your massage.

29:54.063 --> 29:55.812
Wait, did you say cement?

30:20.339 --> 30:22.762
Rene Dugat. 1 of dealers on the street.

30:23.651 --> 30:24.512
Rene?

30:24.649 --> 30:26.948
Mister Sujic. I just spotted your man.

30:26.967 --> 30:29.738
Follow him, don't let him out of your sight, catch him if you can.

30:29.865 --> 30:31.865
Stay sharp, he's an expert driver.

30:31.942 --> 30:33.729
No. No, he's on foot.

30:35.239 --> 30:36.912
Okay, do-does he have the package with him?

30:37.105 --> 30:38.735
He's carrying a bag if that's what you mean.

30:38.756 --> 30:40.771
Get him, kill him if you need to, I don't really care.

30:41.015 --> 30:44.554
But make sure you do not damage the package, do you understand me?

30:45.241 --> 30:46.241
Yes sir.

31:02.602 --> 31:04.044
Go, go, go! Get him!

32:30.367 --> 32:31.175
Yeah.

32:31.302 --> 32:34.456
Frank, where are you? I've been trying to call you.

32:34.791 --> 32:38.310
There is not much time, so the boy's heart as to fade.

32:38.378 --> 32:42.635
He's on the operating table as I speak. Heart machine is just keeping him alive.

32:42.761 --> 32:43.810
I'm working on it.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.497
What do you mean? What are you doing?!

32:46.597 --> 32:48.558
Do you have the heart or not?!

32:48.616 --> 32:49.808
I'll get back to you.

32:50.138 --> 32:52.253
Aah, shit!

33:09.085 --> 33:10.162
Sir!

33:12.786 --> 33:14.287
Sorry officer, uh...

33:15.191 --> 33:16.806
just admiring the vehicle.

33:17.474 --> 33:18.551
What's in the bag?

33:18.979 --> 33:20.518
Actually, I do need your help.

33:21.168 --> 33:23.456
It's critical that the contents of this bag...

33:23.744 --> 33:25.687
gets to a hospital as soon as possible.

33:26.958 --> 33:29.190
I see, uh... leave it with me.

33:29.632 --> 33:30.536
Thank you.

33:32.962 --> 33:36.311
Can you hold the fort for a few minutes?! Someone just handed me this!

33:36.313 --> 33:39.121
I'll take it in. It looks like the missing heart.

33:46.030 --> 33:46.992
Dispatch-- Ah!

34:00.502 --> 34:03.117
Frank, we can not be playing this game.

34:03.118 --> 34:04.855
The police have the heart, Inspector.

34:04.947 --> 34:05.845
What?!

34:06.076 --> 34:07.368
When did this happen?

34:07.448 --> 34:09.527
I just handed it over, they must've called it in.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.141
It-It's not possible.

34:11.167 --> 34:14.570
My radio... has an open channel with central dispatch.

34:14.609 --> 34:16.440
I would have heard such a call.

34:16.844 --> 34:19.286
This cop didn't call to central station.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.164
Inspector, I'll get back to you.

34:26.373 --> 34:28.161
Frank, what are you doing?!

34:59.370 --> 35:02.235
Inspector, with all due respect, I really can't talk now.

35:02.293 --> 35:05.906
I've just confirmed with dispatch. No officers called in.

35:06.676 --> 35:09.099
But there's 1 unit not responding.

35:09.444 --> 35:10.559
Dirty cops.

35:11.348 --> 35:13.444
I know where they're going. I'm gonna get there first.

35:13.475 --> 35:15.136
- How?
- It's what I do.

35:15.170 --> 35:19.093
We have less than 1 hour before the donated heart becomes useless.

35:19.124 --> 35:22.171
I'm aware of the time, Inspector. That's why I need to hang up now.

35:38.556 --> 35:40.786
- Yes?
- I've got the package, I'm on my way.

35:40.806 --> 35:41.633
All right.

35:42.113 --> 35:43.806
I'll have the money for you when you get here.

35:55.585 --> 35:57.815
You said that you were coming in a police car.

36:02.163 --> 36:03.452
What the fuck?

36:07.129 --> 36:07.668
Shit!

36:19.695 --> 36:22.022
Where's the heart? We don't have much time!

36:22.224 --> 36:22.897
Here.

36:53.393 --> 36:54.970
Hey! You, piece of shit.

36:56.046 --> 36:57.623
Aw! My chest.

36:57.738 --> 36:59.738
- Get in the car!
- It fucking hurt.

37:02.902 --> 37:04.248
You want me to drive?

37:04.306 --> 37:06.229
You want to me to shoot you in the fucking head?

37:35.194 --> 37:35.925
Hello?

37:35.963 --> 37:38.597
Go to the emergency room entrance at the side of the hospital.

37:38.636 --> 37:39.751
Do you have the heart?

37:39.847 --> 37:40.790
Just go, now.

37:45.780 --> 37:46.582
St. Sebastian Hospital.

37:58.959 --> 37:59.786
Hey!

37:59.978 --> 38:00.978
Asshole!

38:01.205 --> 38:02.417
Put down the heart.

38:32.873 --> 38:33.719
Stop!

38:34.251 --> 38:35.578
Drop your gun!

38:52.433 --> 38:54.548
Go. Take the heart.

38:56.180 --> 38:57.353
Get a doctor.

38:59.562 --> 39:01.793
Please... my son--

39:10.921 --> 39:12.152
He's fading!

39:13.532 --> 39:16.917
Filip. Please. My son.

39:17.352 --> 39:19.390
He's fading. Get him inside now!

39:19.391 --> 39:22.337
No, his pulse is still strong. If the heart was hit, it's possibly fake.

39:22.338 --> 39:24.722
If we do not get him to surgery, he will die within half an hour.

39:24.723 --> 39:25.991
What about his heart?

39:27.774 --> 39:31.510
I agree, the heart was not hit. But he's losing too much blood. He can not survive.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.839
Do you know if you're a match with your son?

39:35.917 --> 39:37.955
- Put him in the ambulance.
- He can not survive!

39:37.956 --> 39:39.724
Put him in the ambulance!

39:40.402 --> 39:41.671
Do as he says!

39:42.567 --> 39:45.990
Rene, Rene! Quick, quick! In ambulance!

39:52.057 --> 39:53.710
You will need help to keep him alive.

39:53.711 --> 39:57.136
This car is going to be slow enough with just me and him. Any extra weight, we're not gonna make it.

39:57.398 --> 39:59.345
His surgeon is at home, waiting.

39:59.970 --> 40:02.158
- The heart?
- He has 1 chance.

40:02.271 --> 40:04.559
Take 1 EMT for while you are driving.

40:05.252 --> 40:06.829
Her. You!

40:08.541 --> 40:09.560
You get in.

40:09.983 --> 40:12.092
- No one else.
- Go, go! Quick! Quick!

40:12.822 --> 40:15.784
In the ambulance. Go, go! Quick!

40:52.868 --> 40:54.733
Where... where are we?

40:55.853 --> 40:56.603
Home.

41:05.607 --> 41:07.049
Got to get you inside.

41:08.613 --> 41:09.632
Thank you.

41:14.907 --> 41:15.811
He's dead.

41:17.510 --> 41:19.452
His heart's still good. Get him inside.

41:19.453 --> 41:20.106
Okay.

41:59.910 --> 42:01.525
I finished the transplant.

42:01.679 --> 42:02.833
So far...

42:03.218 --> 42:04.506
everything looks good.

42:04.674 --> 42:06.525
The heart, it was all right?

42:06.650 --> 42:09.065
Despite the delay, it shows no signs of damage.

42:09.258 --> 42:13.147
Uh, start beating almost... uh, immediately. Quite remarkable, actually.

42:13.374 --> 42:14.740
Thank God.

42:19.349 --> 42:20.887
Thank you, Inspector.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.268
Our son owes you his life.

42:31.851 --> 42:34.677
Jesus Christ, Carla. This is some kinky shit!

42:34.696 --> 42:37.004
I'm trying to decide whether or not to kill you.

42:37.241 --> 42:38.651
What? Why?

42:38.652 --> 42:41.557
Lately every job you sent our way has turned to shit!

42:42.755 --> 42:45.889
Hey! That is not my fault, Okay? I mean--

42:46.542 --> 42:48.030
I don't get rich screwing you.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.183
You'd do anything for a big payday.

42:51.503 --> 42:54.849
Well, you know, I'd say, uh... competitive... business.

42:54.850 --> 42:57.195
Yes, but I can decide who to do business with.

42:57.311 --> 42:59.426
We're done, Auggie! You can show yourself out.

42:59.580 --> 43:00.657
You're fired.

43:18.516 --> 43:19.632
How's the boy?

43:20.313 --> 43:21.640
He will be fine.

43:22.065 --> 43:24.546
The doctors are confident of a full recovery.

43:24.937 --> 43:26.091
It's good to hear.

43:26.364 --> 43:27.149
Frank.

43:28.330 --> 43:31.811
We have to talk about what happened... downstairs.

43:32.287 --> 43:35.249
- The man I shot.
- His name is Drago Sujic.

43:36.125 --> 43:38.433
Ah, I thought I recognized him.

43:39.063 --> 43:40.718
He was responsible for all this?

43:40.719 --> 43:42.218
He was trying to save his son.

43:43.308 --> 43:47.007
And in the end that's exactly what happened. I took him home and he gave his son his heart.

43:47.123 --> 43:50.371
Then... some good came of it after all.

43:51.341 --> 43:53.284
Still, such a theft.

43:54.255 --> 43:58.216
It's troubling how someone could be involved in such a terrible crime.

43:58.226 --> 44:01.534
It's possible some of the people involved didn't know all of the details.

44:01.535 --> 44:04.556
I think these people should be more careful in the future.

44:14.388 --> 44:16.177
No more jobs from Kagan.

44:16.494 --> 44:20.148
Don't worry, you'll never hear his name again, let alone see him.

44:23.343 --> 44:25.189
Nice job today, by the way.

44:25.521 --> 44:27.001
An elegant solution.

44:27.985 --> 44:29.293
That's what we're all about.

44:29.785 --> 44:30.842
Good night, Carla.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.323
Good night, Frank.

44:45.153 --> 44:46.673
Drago didn't make it.

44:46.674 --> 44:48.134
You should be pleased.

44:48.153 --> 44:51.269
I would be more pleased if I could get some of these bastards alive.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.516
What about Frank Martin?

44:53.517 --> 44:56.496
He's the connection. I'll stay with him.

44:56.518 --> 45:00.285
Don't waste your energy on this driver. He's not an asset.

45:00.670 --> 45:03.439
He's not just a driver. He's a transporter.

45:30.135 --> 45:31.058
You want?

45:31.597 --> 45:32.308
No.

45:36.258 --> 45:37.758
You know what's difficult?

45:38.225 --> 45:39.629
Learning Hungarian.

45:40.245 --> 45:42.822
No, no, no. Harder than learning Hungarian.

45:46.140 --> 45:47.563
Do you want to keep me guessing?

45:47.756 --> 45:50.198
Removing dry cement from an automobile.

45:50.587 --> 45:55.029
You see, Frank, this is a very long, very tiring process.

45:55.782 --> 45:57.301
You want to know what's involved?

45:57.378 --> 45:58.255
Not really.

45:58.447 --> 46:02.159
You take 1 part of muriadic acid and 4 parts of water.

46:02.428 --> 46:07.813
And then, you use a toothbrush to scrub it away at the hardened concrete.

46:14.604 --> 46:15.969
Yeah. Ow.

46:19.508 --> 46:21.469
Here. Feel that.

46:23.008 --> 46:25.565
- I don't want to feel your back, Dieter.
- Just feel.

46:27.242 --> 46:29.800
Ow! Yeah. Do you feel that?

46:30.303 --> 46:31.322
I'm not--

46:31.842 --> 46:34.612
I'm not a doctor, Dieter. If you need to see a doctor, you just see one.

46:43.825 --> 46:45.344
What I need is a massage.

46:45.830 --> 46:47.023
I though you got a massage?

46:47.024 --> 46:48.696
It was not what I was expecting.

46:48.754 --> 46:49.792
What were you--?

46:50.862 --> 46:52.208
I don't want to know, do I?

46:55.015 --> 46:56.477
It didn't end well.

46:56.919 --> 46:58.362
That's all you need to know.
