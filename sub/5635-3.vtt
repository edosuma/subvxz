00:18.749 --> 00:20.583
(door bell tinkles)
Hi, everyone.

00:20.584 --> 00:22.368
Hey, Teddy.
Hi, Teddy.

00:22.419 --> 00:23.870
Hi, little witch.
(music plays, witch chatters)

00:23.921 --> 00:25.922
Aah!
It has a motion sensor.

00:25.923 --> 00:27.323
It's okay, Teddy.
Calm down.

00:27.324 --> 00:29.008
(whoops)
Look at her go.

00:29.043 --> 00:30.877
She's all that and a pointy hat.
Is it me,

00:30.878 --> 00:33.846
or is she just doing the same
thing over and over again?

00:33.881 --> 00:35.498
How's it work?
It's electronic.

00:35.499 --> 00:37.550
Just move your hand in front of it.
Aah!

00:37.551 --> 00:39.685
I just explained it.
Turn it off!

00:39.720 --> 00:41.187
She won't stop making
eye contact with me!

00:41.221 --> 00:44.006
Aw, come on, Teddy.
Tomorrow's Halloween.

00:44.024 --> 00:46.025
We're trying to get into
the holiday spirit. Boo!

00:46.026 --> 00:47.343
Yeah, we're even taking
the kids

00:47.344 --> 00:48.978
to a haunted house
this afternoon.

00:49.012 --> 00:50.279
It's an annual tradition.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.731
Like when Dad replaces
all the sponges.

00:51.732 --> 00:52.982
Sponge Day!

00:53.016 --> 00:54.484
They last longer
than you think.

00:54.518 --> 00:56.235
Ugh! Again with
the haunted houses?

00:56.236 --> 00:57.987
I think I'll pass this year.

00:58.021 --> 01:00.189
What's the matter, Louise?
You don't like being scared?

01:00.190 --> 01:02.575
Are you kidding?
I would <i> love</i> to be scared.

01:02.576 --> 01:05.411
The problem is I see
every scare coming a mile away.

01:05.412 --> 01:07.580
Don't you?
Why doesn't everyone?

01:07.581 --> 01:09.198
(groans, stammers)

01:09.199 --> 01:11.217
Haunted houses are so dumb.

01:11.218 --> 01:13.252
Oh, a coffin.
Real original.

01:13.303 --> 01:15.671
I wonder if something's
gonna pop out of there.

01:15.705 --> 01:17.090
(evil laughter) Aah! Aah!

01:17.091 --> 01:18.758
(honks nose)
SCARY CLOWN: Oh.

01:18.759 --> 01:20.209
(growls)
GENE & TINA: Aah! Okay,

01:20.210 --> 01:21.928
maybe wear less cologne
next time.

01:21.929 --> 01:25.481
Smell kind of gave you away.
He smells terrifying.

01:25.482 --> 01:28.101
(mimicking chainsaw)
Sir...

01:28.152 --> 01:30.052
you're making chainsaw noises
with your mouth.

01:30.070 --> 01:31.404
Sorry.
Yeah.

01:31.438 --> 01:32.888
(sighs)
It's not fair.

01:32.889 --> 01:34.490
Tina and Gene can be scared
by anything.

01:34.491 --> 01:36.526
Watch.
Aah! Aah! Clapping!

01:36.560 --> 01:38.244
And look at Teddy.
He gets scared by a toy witch.

01:38.245 --> 01:41.030
(music plays, witch chatters)
Aah! Get out of here!

01:41.064 --> 01:42.615
Be nice to her.

01:42.666 --> 01:44.250
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.

01:44.251 --> 01:45.835
There. There's
your little hat.

01:45.836 --> 01:48.254
See? I want that.
I mean, not that exactly

01:48.255 --> 01:50.256
but something like that.
That rush!

01:50.257 --> 01:52.508
That's a shame, Louise.
Hey, could I trouble you

01:52.509 --> 01:54.627
for another side of... pickles!
TINA & GENE: Aah!

01:54.628 --> 01:56.412
Nice try, Mort.
It's just not gonna work.

01:56.413 --> 01:58.414
I can't be scared.
It's a curse.

01:58.415 --> 02:00.133
Could I still get those pickles?
No.

02:00.134 --> 02:01.467
Oh.
I'm upset.

02:01.518 --> 02:03.252
Louise, what if I told you
this is the year

02:03.253 --> 02:06.755
you finally get scared? Because
this haunted house is special.

02:06.773 --> 02:08.524
How is it special?
Is there a VIP list?

02:08.525 --> 02:10.526
Will there be any
Hollywood bigwigs there?

02:10.526 --> 02:13.279
Is anyone from
<i>Murphy Brown</i> coming?

02:13.313 --> 02:16.232
It's special because your
father and I planned it!

02:16.266 --> 02:19.101
Wait, what? You two
made a haunted house?

02:19.119 --> 02:20.269
Yep. It's in a secret location.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.271
We've been working on it
all week.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.990
You might want to wear pants
you don't care about

02:23.991 --> 02:25.658
'cause you're gonna
be peein' in 'em!

02:25.709 --> 02:28.444
Scare me enough and I'll pee in your pants.
Deal.

02:28.445 --> 02:30.830
Mom's bringing the scary
and Dad's bringing the hairy.

02:30.831 --> 02:32.999
Did you guys know about this?
No. No.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.634
Okay.
Where is it?

02:34.668 --> 02:37.119
You'll see.
We should probably have a safeword.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.921
I vote for,
"Mom and Dad, stop it."

02:38.955 --> 02:41.591
All right! If you
got it, haunt it.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.627
♪ When I see you I fall apart ♪

02:44.645 --> 02:46.512
♪ Like a zombie,
I got too nervous... ♪

02:46.563 --> 02:49.482
Dad, this is the new Boyz 4 Now song.
That's great, Tina.

02:49.483 --> 02:51.567
It just dropped today.
Don't say "dropped."

02:51.568 --> 02:53.486
LOUISE & GENE: Dropped.
Okay, okay.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.104
I've never been
in this neighborhood before.

02:55.138 --> 02:56.939
Looks like a lot of
old people live here.

02:56.973 --> 02:59.358
See, it's already getting good.
Old people are scary.

02:59.359 --> 03:02.195
<i>Being</i> an old person is scary.
Right, Mom and Dad?

03:02.196 --> 03:03.196
Mm.
Hey!

03:03.197 --> 03:04.197
It is.

03:04.248 --> 03:06.332
LINDA:
<i>Here we are.</i>

03:06.333 --> 03:08.334
I mean... (scarily):
here we are.

03:08.335 --> 03:10.753
Now give your mom and me exactly
four minutes to go inside

03:10.754 --> 03:12.588
and finish setting up.
And then...

03:12.589 --> 03:14.290
enter if you dare.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.591
Wait! I don't get it!

03:15.592 --> 03:17.960
Did you guys buy a house
just to haunt?

03:17.994 --> 03:20.046
It's complicated!
We'll explain later!

03:20.097 --> 03:21.847
What's the plan? You gonna
flip this mamma jamma?

03:21.848 --> 03:23.683
Gonna need a paint job!

03:23.684 --> 03:25.351
LOUISE: All right,
let's see what

03:25.352 --> 03:26.686
the old kooks have cooked up.

03:26.687 --> 03:28.437
GENE: I hope
it's not Dad in sandals.

03:28.438 --> 03:30.172
TINA: Yeah, his toes
are a nightmare.

03:30.190 --> 03:32.391
Welcome!

03:32.442 --> 03:34.026
Nice to creep you.

03:34.027 --> 03:36.896
Allow me
to intro-boo myself.

03:36.947 --> 03:39.482
I am the ghostess
with the mostess!

03:39.516 --> 03:41.517
Hi, Mom.
I am not your mother.

03:41.518 --> 03:43.686
I am Lady Bobbenstein,

03:43.687 --> 03:46.872
made in a lab from parts
of beautiful dead women.

03:46.907 --> 03:49.358
And they didn't have any
other ankles? Just asking.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.409
Gene! No, they're good.
They're good. They're fine.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.546
Ooh... lightning!

03:53.580 --> 03:55.164
Aah! That could cause
a seizure!

03:55.198 --> 03:57.032
Now, won't you join me

03:57.033 --> 04:00.553
for a tour of our
spooky home laboratory?

04:00.587 --> 04:02.555
Oh, yeah, there's nothing
scarier than a tour.

04:02.556 --> 04:03.756
Let's do this!

04:03.807 --> 04:05.725
Yeah. Follow me

04:05.726 --> 04:08.394
to the mad scientist
who stitched me together,

04:08.395 --> 04:10.563
Dr. Bobbenstein!

04:10.597 --> 04:12.765
Hello. Here in my lab,

04:12.766 --> 04:17.553
I store human body parts
to make my monsters.

04:17.553 --> 04:20.221
Aah! That wig is scary
and so are the countertops!

04:20.223 --> 04:23.058
I know! I can't look at them!
And what's up with that backsplash?

04:23.076 --> 04:26.395
Uh-oh! There's rats tickling your toes!
Aah! Aah!

04:26.396 --> 04:30.733
And now please stick your hand
into this doctor box to feel...

04:30.734 --> 04:32.868
human eyes!

04:32.902 --> 04:34.570
Uh...

04:34.571 --> 04:36.405
Huh.
Excuse me, Doctor,

04:36.406 --> 04:38.758
I think you might need a refill
on eyeballs.

04:38.792 --> 04:42.077
Wh-What do you mean?
There's nothing in here.

04:42.078 --> 04:44.297
Do you guys need some time
to work this out?

04:44.348 --> 04:47.016
Uh, hold on, hold on.
Just give us a second. Okay.

04:47.017 --> 04:48.601
(quietly): Lin, did you forget
to put the grapes in the box?

04:48.602 --> 04:50.853
You were supposed to get
the grapes. I got the spaghetti.

04:50.854 --> 04:52.588
Okay, fine, just skip it.
Skip it.

04:52.606 --> 04:55.107
Lady Bobben-steen...
Bobbenstein.

04:55.108 --> 04:59.445
Stein. It appears
your stitches are coming undone.

04:59.446 --> 05:03.098
Oh, no!
My intestines!

05:03.099 --> 05:04.283
Aah!
Yuck!

05:04.284 --> 05:06.935
Mom, angel hair?
What? It's all we had.

05:06.953 --> 05:08.954
It's just...
that's the least scary pasta.

05:08.955 --> 05:10.606
It's in the name.

05:10.624 --> 05:14.794
And now, while I stitch
Lady Bobbenstein back up,

05:14.828 --> 05:17.112
get ready for the next part

05:17.130 --> 05:18.714
of our haunted tour.

05:18.715 --> 05:20.549
I smell a costume change!

05:20.550 --> 05:23.469
You guys, I think I know
what this haunted house needs.

05:23.470 --> 05:25.471
Grapes? Should
I call my guy?

05:25.472 --> 05:27.456
No, Gene.
It needs scares.

05:27.474 --> 05:29.475
Someone in this house
should get spooked.

05:29.476 --> 05:31.310
I was spooked.
A little.

05:31.311 --> 05:32.561
Were you?
Maybe not.

05:32.562 --> 05:33.813
I was either scared
or chilly.

05:33.814 --> 05:35.648
I was confused and anxious.

05:35.649 --> 05:37.966
I say we show Mom and Dad
how it's done.

05:37.984 --> 05:40.486
You mean scare Mom and Dad
in their own haunted house?

05:40.520 --> 05:43.522
That's right. Let's turn
our parents into "scare-ents."

05:43.523 --> 05:46.409
Yeah! And then back into parents
in time for bath and bed.

05:49.477 --> 05:50.977
How are we gonna scare
Mom and Dad?

05:50.978 --> 05:52.712
Dad's scared of failure.

05:52.747 --> 05:53.947
Where do we find some of that?

05:53.981 --> 05:55.282
Let's look in the cupboards.

05:55.316 --> 05:56.850
No, no, no.
Just follow my lead.

05:56.851 --> 05:58.852
LINDA:
And now for your next haunt,

05:58.853 --> 06:00.687
walk down the hallway,

06:00.688 --> 06:04.124
but whatever you do,
don't open the closet door!

06:04.158 --> 06:07.561
Wow! This might be the scariest
haunted house I've ever been to!

06:07.562 --> 06:09.830
Okay, here we come!
Right, guys?

06:09.831 --> 06:11.431
Yeah, we're coming
down the hall!

06:11.432 --> 06:13.049
Frightened and afraid!

06:13.050 --> 06:16.052
Aah! Two-headed monster!
Aah...!

06:16.053 --> 06:17.687
Where are the kids?
I don't know.

06:17.688 --> 06:19.172
It sounded
like they were right here.

06:19.190 --> 06:21.441
Kids?
Gene? Louise? Tina?

06:21.442 --> 06:24.811
Look, Bob,
the back door is open.

06:24.845 --> 06:27.531
Kids? Kids!
We don't even know this area.

06:27.532 --> 06:29.950
They could be anywhere!
Don't panic. Let's look around.

06:29.951 --> 06:33.036
We'll find them. Kids?!
Oh, God, Bob, look!

06:33.037 --> 06:35.155
It's Tina's glasses
in a pile of leaves!

06:35.189 --> 06:37.741
(anguished sounds)
Tina! Not like that!

06:37.792 --> 06:40.026
TINA & LOUISE & GENE: Rawr!
LINDA & BOB: Aah!

06:40.027 --> 06:41.378
Gotcha.

06:41.379 --> 06:42.695
And <i> that's</i>
how you scare somebody.

06:42.696 --> 06:44.414
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

06:44.415 --> 06:45.865
They got us.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.167
Gene, why are you
in your underpants?

06:47.201 --> 06:48.701
Don't change the subject,
Father!

06:48.702 --> 06:51.037
We just scared your pants off,
not mine!

06:51.038 --> 06:52.539
Also, I was warm!

06:52.540 --> 06:54.374
Yeah. You tricks
just got treated.

06:54.392 --> 06:56.726
I mean, kind of.
You basically just jumped out

06:56.727 --> 06:58.478
of a pile of leaves.
Yep.

06:58.479 --> 07:01.264
And we put, like, a lot
of effort into our thing.

07:01.315 --> 07:03.099
Sad how ours worked better
than yours, huh?

07:03.151 --> 07:05.435
Yeah. It really is.
Well, should we go?

07:05.436 --> 07:07.887
Can we go to the other house
that's ours, that's fine?

07:07.905 --> 07:09.906
No, we're not finished
with our haunted house.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.025
We haven't even gotten
to the exorcism.

07:12.059 --> 07:13.527
I think we're good, Mom.

07:13.561 --> 07:15.278
I was gonna spin my head
around in a circle

07:15.279 --> 07:17.914
and barf on your father.
Like the good ol' days. Ha!

07:17.915 --> 07:20.066
Lin. Lin, stop.
It's over. Bleh.

07:20.084 --> 07:21.418
We're-we're just not
that good at this.

07:21.419 --> 07:23.253
Hmm. B-plus.
Maybe B-minus.

07:23.254 --> 07:26.039
Hey, why give it a grade?
Bob, don't give up.

07:26.073 --> 07:27.907
We squeezed ourselves
into this T-shirt.

07:27.908 --> 07:30.260
We can't go home now.
Or we could.

07:30.294 --> 07:32.745
You can spin your head around
at home while we watch TV.

07:32.746 --> 07:35.765
All right, fine, you sour
candies, we'll go home.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.801
Gene, you're gonna put
your clothes back on, right?

07:37.852 --> 07:39.302
Oh, am I?
I...

07:39.303 --> 07:41.254
You're the one making it weird,
Dad.

07:41.255 --> 07:43.640
Oh, crap.
We have a flat tire.

07:43.641 --> 07:46.092
What? Here, I'll blow it up.
Give it to me, give it to me.

07:46.093 --> 07:48.261
What about the spare?
That was the spare.

07:48.262 --> 07:50.647
All four of these are spares.
Are you talking about us?

07:50.648 --> 07:52.265
I guess I'll call for a tow.

07:52.266 --> 07:54.601
Oh, great. I'm not getting
any reception here.

07:54.602 --> 07:56.820
That old man
is staring at us.

07:58.155 --> 08:01.441
That's weird.
Hello? Can we help you?

08:02.710 --> 08:04.711
Take a picture!
It'll last longer!

08:04.712 --> 08:06.162
Wait, don't take it yet!

08:06.163 --> 08:08.131
Catch me just
as I'm looking over my shoulder.

08:08.132 --> 08:09.382
Now!

08:09.383 --> 08:11.284
Oh, come on, how can
I not have any bars?

08:11.285 --> 08:12.987
Why's he staring at us?

08:13.004 --> 08:15.005
TINA: Maybe we just have
that certain something...

08:15.056 --> 08:18.308
that makes you want to stare
at us... and not say anything...

08:18.309 --> 08:21.895
while holding gardening shears.
Hi! Hello, sir!

08:21.896 --> 08:24.764
Cell reception, huh?
Not so great around here?

08:24.798 --> 08:28.351
Okay, he's not
saying anything. Um...

08:28.352 --> 08:30.803
why don't we go back inside
and see if the landline works?

08:30.821 --> 08:33.490
Bye, creepy man!
Keep it creepy!

08:33.491 --> 08:34.691
Lock it, Bob.

08:34.692 --> 08:35.717
Yeah. Good idea.

08:37.745 --> 08:39.722
(dial tone hums)
Oh, thank God. It works.

08:39.746 --> 08:42.582
Wow, this phonebook is,
like, from the '90s.

08:42.582 --> 08:46.486
Let's see if Tony Toni Tow-me
is still in business.

08:46.504 --> 08:49.422
Hey, Mom, question, why does
this house have mothball smell?

08:49.423 --> 08:51.258
Follow-up question,
whose house is this?

08:51.259 --> 08:54.044
David Lee Mothball?
Maybe the owner of a mothball team?

08:54.095 --> 08:55.828
It's an empty house
that Mort said we could use.

08:55.829 --> 08:57.097
It belonged
to one of his clients.

08:57.098 --> 08:58.074
(metallic grinding)
(Linda gasps)

08:58.099 --> 09:00.166
Uh... what
was that?

09:00.184 --> 09:01.601
Gene, did that
come out of you?

09:01.602 --> 09:04.220
My butt doesn't have
the technology! Yet.

09:04.272 --> 09:06.273
Huh. It was probably just
the pipes.

09:06.274 --> 09:08.942
Oh, hi, uh, I, uh...
I need a tow truck.

09:08.943 --> 09:11.111
I have a flat tire.
Or I'll need a tire.

09:11.112 --> 09:13.613
Or-or air, I guess,
for the tire.

09:13.614 --> 09:15.031
But you're the professional.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.866
Wait, Mom,
did you say this house

09:16.867 --> 09:19.319
is one of Mort's clients'?
Yeah, why?

09:19.353 --> 09:23.573
Mort's a mortician, so aren't
his clients all dead people?

09:23.624 --> 09:25.625
(metallic grinding continues)
(Linda, Gene, Tina gasp)

09:25.626 --> 09:27.627
All right, pipes. We heard
you the first time.

09:27.628 --> 09:29.629
Stop being so desperate
for attention.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.531
Everybody,
keep it down, please. Uh...

09:31.549 --> 09:34.134
the address is... Oh, shoot,
I don't know the address.

09:34.135 --> 09:37.036
Uh, hold on... Lin, go outside
and look at the house number.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.222
No. Oldie Scissorhands
is out there.

09:39.256 --> 09:41.708
Oh, wait, I wrote it down.
It's, uh,

09:41.709 --> 09:46.096
37 Poplar... Wait,
is that "Poplar" or "Popular"?

09:46.097 --> 09:47.681
No, streets aren't
called Popular.

09:47.715 --> 09:48.715
(loud bang) ALL: Aah!

09:48.716 --> 09:50.433
Whoa.
Oh, my God, Bob.

09:50.434 --> 09:51.718
There's something
in the basement!

09:51.736 --> 09:53.820
No, no, no.
The phone line is dead.

09:53.821 --> 09:56.556
And it's dark!
It's literally a triple threat!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.265
LINDA: <i>What could possibly
make a sound like that?</i>

10:00.266 --> 10:01.767
It's probably just
a raccoon or a possum

10:01.768 --> 10:03.502
running around
in the basement.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.004
So did this raccoon and/or
possum shake the whole house

10:06.005 --> 10:07.840
and turn off all the lights,
Father?!

10:07.841 --> 10:10.175
Gene, it probably just
chewed through a wire

10:10.176 --> 10:14.317
and then that short... circuited
the fuse... breaker... thing.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.814
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, go on.

10:15.815 --> 10:16.915
You clearly know what
you're talking about.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.350
(metallic grinding)
Uh...

10:18.351 --> 10:20.085
I don't like the sound
of that sound.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.520
We should get out of this house, Bob.
No, no, Lin,

10:21.521 --> 10:24.223
the tow truck is coming.
We have to wait for it.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.824
Look, why don't I just
go downstairs

10:25.825 --> 10:27.359
and see what's
making the noise?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.495
I'm sure there is
nothing to be afraid of.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.696
Then we can relax

10:30.697 --> 10:32.431
until the tow truck
gets here.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.533
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark,
dark, dark, dark, dark! Uh...

10:34.534 --> 10:36.568
LINDA: Leave the light, Bob.
Are you crazy?

10:36.569 --> 10:38.070
Well, I can't see
what's in the basement

10:38.071 --> 10:39.471
if I don't have the light, Lin.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.206
All right, fine.
We're coming with you.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.309
Just a fun family trip
to the basement to get killed.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.778
Gene, we're not
gonna get killed.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.596
Maimed. Stabbed.
Lin. Linda.

10:47.597 --> 10:48.981
Beaten. Burned.
Lin. Stop.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.649
What?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.434
BOB:
See? It's just a normal,

10:52.435 --> 10:55.404
dark, very, very dark
basement.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.389
(moans) Lin, you're digging
your fingernails into my arm.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.362
Oh, sorry.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.660
Can I dig my fingernails
into your other arm, Dad?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.228
Sure, Tina. Yes.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.280
I call love handles.
That's my word for the butt.

11:05.281 --> 11:07.065
I'm already holding it.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.501
Just 'cause I don't want
to fall down the stairs.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.619
Dad's butt is very sturdy.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.404
Thank you, Louise.
It is.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.590
Oh look, they have a puddle
in their basement, too.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.591
It's ghost pee.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.176
Gene, it's not ghost pee.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.911
Look, see, everything
seems fine. Nothing weird.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.014
There's a washing machine.
A furnace.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.600
Some old boxes of junk.
And a ghost!

11:24.601 --> 11:26.602
ALL: Aah!
What is that?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.086
Okay, it's not a ghost.
It's not a ghost.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.521
It's just a... uh...

11:29.522 --> 11:31.256
a cloak.
It's a cloak.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.108
LINDA: It's a cloak.
See? Nothing to worry about.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.427
Yeah, there's nothing scary
about a dark cloak hanging

11:35.428 --> 11:37.479
from a meat hook
in a dead person's basement!

11:37.480 --> 11:38.763
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.199
Plenty of people
have cloaks, right?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.450
Monks, and w-wizards and...
Mm-hmm.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.784
Mm-hmm, sure.
Liberace.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.769
Yup.
Uh, Ann Wilson from Heart.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.272
Definitely. Maybe it's just a
really dark, scary night shirt.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.159
(loud thud, demonic croaking)

11:50.160 --> 11:52.161
(all screaming)

11:52.162 --> 11:54.446
Run!

11:54.447 --> 11:56.882
Oh, my God.
All right, we're getting out of this house.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.167
Good idea.
Everybody, follow me.

11:58.168 --> 11:59.168
Okay.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.673
Oh, God. There's something
right outside, Bobby. Uh...

12:04.674 --> 12:07.009
everyone upstairs now.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.678
We got to hide somewhere.

12:09.679 --> 12:11.730
How about behind Dad?
I'm not big enough.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.149
Keep telling yourself
that, pal.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.351
You guys. Look.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.157
That isn't a good use
of that room.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.642
Yeah, let's maybe
rule that room out.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.827
Uh, uh, um,
yeah, the bathroom.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.145
Let's go in the bathroom.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.980
Yeah, let's go to the bathroom.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.817
Okay. Let's talk
about what we just saw.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.370
I, for one,
did not care for it.

12:35.371 --> 12:37.539
That doll makes me miss
the cloak in the basement.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.875
Louise, I wish I was
un-scare-able like you.

12:39.876 --> 12:42.094
Yeah, it's just dumb cult stuff.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.512
Nothing to be scared of.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.163
(nervous laughter):
I mean, what is it with

12:45.164 --> 12:46.886
the sticks these days, right?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.001
What if it's the ghost of the
person who used to live here

12:50.002 --> 12:51.836
and they hate mustaches?

12:51.837 --> 12:53.505
Then two of you are in trouble.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.723
It's not a ghost, Lin.

12:54.724 --> 12:56.108
There's no such thing as ghosts.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.842
Fine, then, Bob.
What do you think it is?

12:57.843 --> 13:00.178
It's probably just a murderer.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.347
What?
No, it's not a murderer, Tina.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.900
It's probably just the wind.
Inside wind.

13:04.901 --> 13:07.519
It-it happens a lot
in these old houses.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.570
I know about inside wind.

13:08.571 --> 13:09.854
I know about it right now.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.206
Sorry, everybody.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.791
Ugh, Gene.
Come on.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.376
It's something bad.
It's gonna kill us

13:14.377 --> 13:16.361
in this bathroom
and it's gonna...

13:16.362 --> 13:18.863
it's gonna be easy to clean up
'cause of the tile floor.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.132
Linda, you're not helping.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.700
Also, will you take off
that bald cap?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.201
It's freaking everyone out.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.886
I didn't even know
I still had it on.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.306
It's comfortable.
Wait, listen.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.308
(slow, heavy footsteps
approaching)

13:29.309 --> 13:31.310
BOB:
Oh, my God.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.146
The wind...
is coming up the stairs.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.565
Okay, nobody move.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.400
Nobody say a word.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.985
Dad.
Yes.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.438
I feel like you're doing
a really good job as a dad.

13:43.439 --> 13:46.241
Thank you, Gene.
I'm having a good childhood.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.060
Okay, great.
Not right now, but overall.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.946
I got it. Thanks.
No, thank <i> you.</i>

13:50.947 --> 13:53.332
Uh, okay...
Thank you for <i> your</i> service.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.950
Just, um, try and be quiet.

13:54.951 --> 13:56.038
(moans)

13:56.919 --> 13:58.587
Whatever it is,

13:58.588 --> 13:59.955
it's right outside.

13:59.956 --> 14:01.293
(moan)

14:02.625 --> 14:04.126
You guys, if we
go out this window,

14:04.127 --> 14:05.464
we can get on the roof.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.414
(moaning)
Um... yeah.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.416
Go, go, go.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.771
Now what? We're on
a freakin' roof.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.473
The only way down is down.

14:18.474 --> 14:20.258
Oh, my God. I hope
the tow truck is coming.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.777
Please let the tow truck
be coming.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.779
And I hope they bring a ladder.
And the police.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.097
Mom and Dad, you would tell us
if we knew how to fly, right?

14:26.098 --> 14:27.366
Uh, you guys...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.201
(low, indistinct chanting)

14:29.202 --> 14:32.704
That seems weird...
and bad.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.457
Maybe that's Tony,
Toni, and Tow-me?

14:35.458 --> 14:37.442
Holy crap!

14:37.443 --> 14:38.777
Oh, my God!

14:38.778 --> 14:40.379
We're surrounded
by a ring of fire!

14:40.380 --> 14:41.630
Who has a ring of water?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.948
Aah! Is this
what Burning Man is?

14:43.949 --> 14:45.500
Because I don't like it!

14:48.142 --> 14:49.475
LINDA:
What do we do? What do we do?

14:49.476 --> 14:50.710
We got scary cloak
people down there

14:50.711 --> 14:52.812
and something creepy
chasing us in there.

14:52.813 --> 14:55.982
And I'm scared of heights and
cloak people and being killed.

14:56.016 --> 14:58.351
Ah! I have reception.
I'm calling for help.

14:58.385 --> 15:00.186
My emergency contact
is Jimmy Junior.

15:00.187 --> 15:01.787
If you can't reach him,
you can also try 911.

15:01.822 --> 15:03.339
Oh, crap!
Aah!

15:04.424 --> 15:05.675
That's fine.
No big deal.

15:05.676 --> 15:07.210
We don't need that.
Oh, my God,

15:07.261 --> 15:08.494
they're gonna sacrifice us.

15:08.495 --> 15:09.795
I hate this neighborhood.

15:09.829 --> 15:11.714
Okay, everybody
just stay calm, all right?

15:11.715 --> 15:13.099
We're up here.
They're down there.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.833
There's no way
they can get to us.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.686
Yeah. They're not even
a great cult, anyway.

15:16.687 --> 15:18.554
Just a circle of fire,
you know, some cloaks,

15:18.555 --> 15:21.507
and a creepy doll
with twigs for eyes, right?

15:21.508 --> 15:23.526
What's so scary about that?
That's not scary.

15:23.527 --> 15:25.528
That's not scary!

15:25.562 --> 15:27.113
(dramatic musical stinger
plays)

15:28.014 --> 15:29.848
(screaming)

15:29.849 --> 15:31.567
Louise...

15:31.568 --> 15:33.519
LINDA: Louise, sweetie,
sweetie, baby.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.020
(screaming stops)

15:35.021 --> 15:36.706
What is happening?

15:36.707 --> 15:37.740
Gotcha.

15:37.791 --> 15:39.825
Wha...?
We got you. Huh?

15:39.859 --> 15:41.794
(laughs)
We gotcha.

15:41.795 --> 15:43.462
You wanted
to be scared, Louise.

15:43.463 --> 15:44.914
Well, I think we scared you.

15:44.915 --> 15:46.716
Wait a... You, uh...
What...

15:46.717 --> 15:48.534
We planned the whole thing.
What?

15:48.535 --> 15:50.703
(gasps): What? Aw, you should
see the look on your face.

15:50.704 --> 15:52.221
You see? It's you,

15:52.256 --> 15:54.390
scared.
So...

15:54.424 --> 15:55.675
they're in on it, too?

15:55.709 --> 15:57.560
Hi, Louise. Happy Halloween.

15:57.561 --> 15:59.729
It's Teddy
from your dad's restaurant.

15:59.763 --> 16:01.430
Teddy?
Hi, Louise.

16:01.481 --> 16:02.932
Mort?

16:02.983 --> 16:05.050
Aah!
Hey, hey, easy.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.602
That's my mother.
Say hi, Mom.

16:06.603 --> 16:08.271
(wails)

16:08.272 --> 16:10.189
No, Mom. We're done.
It's over. We did it.

16:10.223 --> 16:11.741
And this nice man
with the hedge clippers

16:11.742 --> 16:12.891
is Mort's mom's
new boyfriend, Arthur.

16:12.892 --> 16:14.076
Hi, how you doing.

16:14.077 --> 16:15.745
I call him Arth Vader.

16:15.746 --> 16:17.730
'Cause of the way he breathes.
He has allergies.

16:17.731 --> 16:20.399
Gene? Tina? You two
were in on this too?

16:20.417 --> 16:21.667
Yeah, we were acting.

16:21.668 --> 16:23.002
I practiced
all my lines last night.

16:23.003 --> 16:24.570
Like this:
"Aah."

16:24.571 --> 16:26.589
I wanted to do the whole thing
with a Cockney accent,

16:26.590 --> 16:28.090
but Mom nixed it.

16:28.125 --> 16:31.177
I-I don't understand.
How did you do all this?

16:31.178 --> 16:33.129
And how did I fall for it?

16:33.180 --> 16:35.798
It was a lot of work.
So many e-mails.

16:35.849 --> 16:37.934
This is Mort's mom's house.
And it's perfect

16:37.935 --> 16:39.418
'cause it's old and creepy.

16:39.419 --> 16:42.271
And nicely decorated.
Very homey.

16:42.306 --> 16:44.440
<i>First we had to do
the decoy haunted house.</i>

16:44.474 --> 16:47.393
Yeah, why <i> did</i> you do
a decoy haunted house?

16:47.427 --> 16:49.729
That was Tina's idea.
It was genius.

16:49.763 --> 16:51.948
<i>She said we had to do
the world's worst haunted house</i>

16:51.949 --> 16:53.482
<i>so that you wouldn't
suspect us.</i>

16:53.533 --> 16:55.952
Oh, I was talking about
something else when I said that.

16:55.986 --> 16:58.437
Wait. Really?
Hey, a good idea's a good idea.

16:58.438 --> 17:01.123
Besides, it wasn't the
world's worst haunted house.

17:01.158 --> 17:02.325
<i>The bald caps were good.</i>

17:02.376 --> 17:03.609
<i>The spaghetti...</i>

17:03.610 --> 17:04.827
Unbelievable.

17:04.828 --> 17:06.444
You guys set me up.

17:06.445 --> 17:07.445
And we almost got away
with it.

17:07.446 --> 17:09.114
Oh, wait! We did!

17:09.132 --> 17:11.751
Yup. While you were going
through the decoy haunted house,

17:11.785 --> 17:13.803
<i>Teddy took the air
out of our tire.</i>

17:13.837 --> 17:15.221
Yeah. And I also
cut the brake line.

17:15.222 --> 17:17.473
I thought that
would be scary, too.

17:17.473 --> 17:18.824
Teddy, are you serious?

17:18.842 --> 17:19.842
Hey, let's not worry
about that, Bobby.

17:19.843 --> 17:21.594
Finish your story.

17:21.627 --> 17:23.962
TINA: <i>Mort hid in the basement
and made scary sounds.</i>

17:23.981 --> 17:26.464
Mort, how did you make
that crazy croaking sound?

17:26.465 --> 17:27.965
That actually came out of me.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.685
<i>I threw my back out when
I was making</i>

17:29.686 --> 17:31.520
<i>that big boom sound.</i>

17:31.521 --> 17:33.522
(demonic croaking)

17:36.526 --> 17:37.994
I'm in a lot of pain.

17:37.995 --> 17:39.695
LINDA: <i>The ring of fire
was Mort's idea.</i>

17:39.696 --> 17:41.163
Is it gonna hurt my grass?

17:41.164 --> 17:42.665
No, Mom.
No, no. It'll be fine.

17:42.666 --> 17:44.166
It's non-burning fire.

17:44.167 --> 17:45.984
And Arthur was really nice
to offer to help.

17:45.985 --> 17:47.753
He's only known Mort's mom
for three weeks.

17:47.754 --> 17:49.922
But it sounds like
it's going really well.

17:49.923 --> 17:52.324
We're just having fun
and seeing where it goes.

17:52.325 --> 17:54.159
No pressure, no labels.
I get it.

17:54.177 --> 17:56.379
So, yeah, that's how
it all came together.

17:56.430 --> 17:58.848
We love you, baby.
Hope you liked it.

17:58.849 --> 17:59.849
Liked it?

17:59.850 --> 18:01.684
It was freakin' incredible!

18:01.685 --> 18:03.436
I'm still shaking.

18:03.437 --> 18:04.770
Look. Look at this.

18:04.771 --> 18:06.505
(laughs)

18:06.506 --> 18:07.506
I can't stop.

18:07.507 --> 18:10.008
Oh, it's great.

18:10.009 --> 18:12.611
I got scared.
I got scared!

18:12.612 --> 18:14.563
Oh, you're the best family
in the whole world.

18:14.564 --> 18:16.449
Aw, my little scream queen.

18:16.450 --> 18:17.867
Happy Halloween, Louise.

18:17.868 --> 18:20.403
Bring it in, everybody.
Bring it in.

18:20.404 --> 18:21.570
(grunts)
I...

18:21.621 --> 18:23.906
love my family...
Lin...

18:23.907 --> 18:25.207
so much.
Lin,

18:25.242 --> 18:26.575
careful.
We're on a roof.

18:26.576 --> 18:28.210
(thunder crashes)
(all scream)

18:29.880 --> 18:31.297
Storm moving in, everyone.
(cackles)

18:31.298 --> 18:33.883
Stop it, Mort.
I startle easily.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.751
Ah, Mort, you little...
(growls)

18:40.039 --> 18:41.757
Hey, girl.

18:41.808 --> 18:43.542
Yo, girl.
Halloween has gotten so commercialized.

18:43.543 --> 18:45.311
So many commercials.

18:45.312 --> 18:48.397
Let's try to get back
to what it's really about.

18:48.398 --> 18:49.565
What's it about, Boo Boo?

18:49.566 --> 18:51.817
Love.
