WEBVTT

00:29.988 --> 00:32.240
-Hey, Mama.
-Hey, Kalina.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.950
-How are we feeling today?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.827
You know, not too shabby.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.537
Been better. Been worse.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.456
Really running the gamut there, huh?

00:39.539 --> 00:40.373
Yeah.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.667
Hmm. Sounds like someone
could use some healing.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.252
Mm-hmm.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.047
Someone sure could.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.806
-Mrs. Harding.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.974
Detective Perez.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.727
I'm surprised
to see you here at the station.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.563
Oh, well, I'm surprised
that Ben Wood was arrested

01:03.646 --> 01:06.691
when I explicitly said
I did not wanna press charges.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.610
Despite your intimate connection
to the suspect,

01:08.693 --> 01:11.404
you might also be surprised
to learn that you don't control the world.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.158
Oh, I'm sorry that I didn't want
the father of my unborn child

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
to be hauled off by police
in front of my other child.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.205
And I'm sorry, but the law is the law.
And Ben Wood broke it.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.416
You know, that's funny
how some days the law is the law

01:23.500 --> 01:27.253
and then other days, the law
is whatever the fuck you want it to be.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.839
And by you, I don't mean the royal you.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.133
I'm literally talking about you.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.720
-And you know what I'm talking about.
-Oh, I do know what you're talking about.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.514
Some days our emotions
get the better of us.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.099
And some days, sober thoughts prevail.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.684
Unfortunately, in Ben Wood's case,
sober thoughts did not prevail

01:41.768 --> 01:43.228
the day he hit you and Miss Hale.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.230
Well, maybe someone in this station

01:45.313 --> 01:48.233
would like to know
what I'm talking about, hmm?

01:48.316 --> 01:50.735
I don't think you wanna open
that can of worms in here.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.655
Well, then where
would you like to open it?

01:53.738 --> 01:56.241
So this is your spirit gate.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.118
It'll help with anxiety.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.285
I'll take it.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.329
And this is your outer gate.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.331
-It's good for pain relief.
-Ow.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.749
-You okay?
-Yeah.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.836
-Some of these can be a little sticky.
-Yes. Sticky.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.798
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.301
Kind of waiting for my friend to call.
Could you maybe check it for me?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.970
Okay. This once.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.054
Thank you.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.560
It's Laguna Oncology.
You need to take this?

02:23.643 --> 02:26.563
No. No, no, they're just…

02:26.646 --> 02:28.982
…calling to confirm my follow-up scan.

02:29.065 --> 02:32.402
All right, big day! When are we going in?

02:32.485 --> 02:36.614
Uh, soon. Yeah, we just,
you know, we gotta double check.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.824
Ah.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.742
Fuck me!

02:39.826 --> 02:40.743
What's that gate?

02:40.827 --> 02:41.953
That's a blocked one.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.664
-We're stressed. We're stressed, okay?

02:44.747 --> 02:46.749
-Let's just try to relax.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.918
-Find our zen place.
-Find our zen place.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.004
-And get centered.
-Get centered.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.298
Maybe give me a warning next time,

02:53.381 --> 02:56.176
like a, "This one's gonna hurt
like a fucking son of a bitch"?

02:56.259 --> 02:58.636
-Okay, you signed up for this.
-Yeah.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.890
How dare you come to my office
and make veiled threats at me?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.474
They're not veiled.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.770
-You're aware I carry a gun, right?
-Okay, I'm just asking you to help Ben.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.938
Oh, please.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.774
His bail will be set faster
than anyone should be comfortable with.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.276
-Really?
-Yes.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.486
Rich white men don't <i>do </i>time, they buy it.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.405
-Oh, God.
-You, on the other hand, do need help.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.741
I don't mean the royal you.
I mean the royally screwed you

03:19.824 --> 03:22.911
because they found DNA
on Steve Wood's body.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.913
-What? They did?
-They did.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.749
Do they know whose it is?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.584
Not yet, but if I had to guess,

03:29.667 --> 03:31.753
I'd probably go with, mm-mm,
the person who killed him.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.797
-Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.
-Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.634
-Fuck, fuck!
-Yep. Mm-hmm.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.928
-Fuck.
-Whew!

03:40.011 --> 03:42.013
-Fuck! Fuck!

03:42.096 --> 03:43.431
-Fuck!

03:43.514 --> 03:44.641
-Fuck!
-Seriously?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.726
-Really? Come on.
-Fuck.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.105
-All right, well, what do we do?
-No, don't--

03:52.106 --> 03:54.525
There's no more "we." Not anymore.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.570
Goodbye, Mrs. Harding.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.327
Fuck!

04:10.667 --> 04:13.628
-What if I just turn myself in?
-What? You can't just give up.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.673
I'm saying, what if I said I did it
before they say I did it?

04:16.756 --> 04:19.133
Then-- then don't
I get some kind of points or something?

04:19.217 --> 04:21.010
I don't think the FBI works
on a point system.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.638
I can't live like this. I'm gonna
have a fucking nervous breakdown.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.807
Now I know why
you were always so confessy.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.350
Now I know why that drove you nuts.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.769
-Yeah, well…
-Okay, look. You have to fight.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.396
You have a baby on the way.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.565
You can't fight science, Judy. It's DNA.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.234
They won't be able to match it to you,

04:36.317 --> 04:38.820
unless they have, like,
your hair or your semen or whatever.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.364
Know what? If they have my semen,
then we have other problems.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.991
You know what I mean. Your lady semen.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.492
-What?
-She-men.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.743
-She-men?
-Yeah.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.453
-Okay, I don't know!
-I don't fucking know!

04:47.537 --> 04:49.789
I don't even know what the fuck DNA is.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.750
We just need to stay calm.
We don't even know what they found.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.294
They could have nothing.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.297
Or they have something, Judy.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.842
And then what? And then there's just--
there's no way out.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.510
There is. There always is.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.054
My mother used to say
there's always an exit somewhere.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.515
-You just have to find it.
-How's that going for her in jail?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.642
You know what we need?

05:09.726 --> 05:10.935
-A lawyer.
-A vacation.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.271
I thought I heard you say "vacation."
That would be insane.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.107
Hmm? Or is it
the sanest thing I've ever said?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.192
-Okay, come on.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.862
We could go somewhere and relax,
like…

05:20.945 --> 05:23.072
…find our zen. Center ourselves.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.699
Okay, we can't just run away.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.951
You have your scans. They're this week.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.454
-Well, I could do them next week.
-No, you can't!

05:31.414 --> 05:33.916
What-- what if you
have to have more chemo?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.211
Well, then I'm definitely
gonna wanna take a vacation first.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.423
Look, I can't just leave here.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.217
-I have work. I have responsibilities. I--

05:43.301 --> 05:44.761
Yes, yes, okay. I get it.

05:44.844 --> 05:45.970
You're totally right.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.474
We should just stay here and tell
the kids you're having Ben's baby.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.559
Where would we even go?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.271
Steve has a place in Mexico.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.566
It's right on the beach.
We could go there.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.985
Okay, let's take a getaway
to the house of the guy

06:01.069 --> 06:03.237
that I am trying to get away with killing.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.865
Hmm. Fair point.
I could find somewhere else.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.076
I mean, it could be Mexico. It--

06:08.785 --> 06:10.119
That sounds real nice.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.913
-It does, right?
-Yeah.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.960
Pinwheel? Pinwheel?
Yeah, there you go.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.214
Oh, little Starvin' Marvins
aren't we today?

06:21.297 --> 06:23.383
-Oh, praise Jesus. I'm starving.
-These aren't for you.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.592
My blood sugar's crashing.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.677
I only ate a baby's handful
of almonds for breakfast.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.846
-Why?
-'Cause I'm keeping it tight.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.140
Because I'm in the market
for a new man-panion.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.394
-By the way, nice listing. Truly.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.523
-Yeah, well, it comes at a price, so…

06:38.606 --> 06:40.024
Oh, man.

06:40.608 --> 06:44.112
Hey, uh, I wanted to ask you,
could you watch the boys for a few days?

06:44.195 --> 06:47.448
And maybe cover me
in case I get some bites here?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.492
-For you? And a split of the commish?
-Hmm.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.452
-Yeah.
-Literally anything.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.787
-Literally?
-Anything.

06:52.870 --> 06:53.955
Oh, my God. Thank you.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.332
-Hey. You okay?
-Yeah.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.418
-Why?
-You just look a little--

06:58.501 --> 06:59.794
-What?
-Nothing.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.337
-Congrats, Jen.
-Oh, f--

07:01.421 --> 07:03.089
Looks like a lot of interested buyers.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.173
Okay, Karen, I told you

07:04.257 --> 07:06.592
that sellers are not supposed
to be at their own open house.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.845
-Then why is Jeff here?
-W-why is Jeff here?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.680
Thank you.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.557
-I'm on it.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.937
He looks good with a tan, don't you think?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.939
Almost Italian.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.984
Not sure what fucking region
you're talking about, but…

07:23.568 --> 07:27.447
I guess…
…beach living really suits him.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
-You need to keep it together, Karen.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.784
I'm sorry.
It's just really hard to let go of him.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.494
He's my best friend.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.997
I mean, was…

07:36.080 --> 07:36.914
Here.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.126
Karen, I say this with love,
but you're making things weird.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.503
-And I need you to leave.
-Okay.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.227
No.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.688
No.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.904
-Hmm.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.781
-Not now, Laguna Oncology.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.422
This tile is actually limestone. Mm-hmm.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.508
Bet you thought travertine, huh?

09:10.591 --> 09:12.009
-I did.
-Surprise.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.970
-Jen.
-Um, what are you still doing here?

09:14.053 --> 09:17.306
Sorry, I was gonna leave, but then
I realized I have nowhere else to go.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.268
Also, there's a potential buyer
in the safe room.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.770
I thought we agreed
to call it the office though, right?

09:22.853 --> 09:26.232
Sorry, it's just
so much change all at once.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.484
Karen, do not go in there.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.698
Oh, hi.
Can I answer any questions for you?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.577
Well, I certainly hope so.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.416
Agent Glenn Moranis. FBI.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.919
Oh, hello.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.714
Uh, wh-what can I, um--

09:50.381 --> 09:53.509
How did you-- how can I, uh--

09:53.593 --> 09:55.803
Are you-- are you looking to buy a house?

09:55.886 --> 09:58.472
No, I'm looking for you.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.184
Hmm.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.240
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:16.324 --> 10:20.077
I found us a great hotel in Baja… Hi!

10:20.161 --> 10:22.121
-Hi.
-Glenn? What the… what?

10:22.204 --> 10:26.584
Yeah, um, Agent, uh, Moranis from the FBI

10:26.667 --> 10:29.754
came by the open house to look for me,
so that's what's happening.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.714
-Hey, Judy. That's a fun hat.
-Hi.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.632
Oh…

10:32.715 --> 10:33.549
This old thing?

10:33.633 --> 10:36.969
It's, um… just my house hat.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.764
It's just the hat I wear in the house.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.265
Yeah.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.062
-Sorry to interrupt your work day.
-Mm-hmm.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.397
Looks like you guys had
a pretty good turnout over there.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.150
What is that place?
Twenty-two hundred square feet?

10:51.233 --> 10:54.070
Uh, it's 2,250. Yeah, you were close.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.989
Oh, close only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.241
-Oh, right. That's…

11:00.201 --> 11:01.786
Uh, I'll only keep you a minute.

11:01.869 --> 11:05.539
Uh, I just have a couple of questions
about your relationship with Steve Wood.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.752
Oh, I wouldn't call that
a relationship.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.712
Well, you were
his real estate agent, right?

11:11.796 --> 11:14.590
Uh, yeah, for, like, a blip.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.093
I mean,
it's like, did that even happen?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.344
Seems like it did.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.347
Uh, according to our records,
you sold him two condos.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.766
All cash.
Before he walked out on the deal.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.185
Yeah. Well, yeah, that-- that did happen.

11:26.268 --> 11:29.063
-How much was that for again?
-I-- I don't remember.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.815
Yeah, probably not top of mind.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.109
Does 8.6 million ring a bell?

11:34.443 --> 11:36.362
Ding. That-- that sounds right.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.115
And did you know he stole that money
from the Greek mafia at the time?

11:39.198 --> 11:42.368
-Like <i>mafia</i> mafia?
-Well, they call themselves a syndicate.

11:42.451 --> 11:43.661
A syndicate. Oh, God.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.706
Jeez, that's actually the first time
I've ever heard that term.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.790
Wow, I am shocked.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.126
-Well, imagine how they felt.
-Right.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.753
But they can't be too surprised, right?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.714
Steve wasn't exactly an angel.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.133
No, Steve was… good.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.552
A fine person.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.849
Did you have
any more contact with him after that?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.103
Um…

12:14.066 --> 12:15.443
<i>Mrs. Harding?</i>

12:16.318 --> 12:17.445
Mrs. Harding.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.409
Uh… I don't-- I don't remember.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.537
Sure.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.707
I'm just curious. You ever do any
real estate outside Laguna Beach?

12:30.291 --> 12:33.210
No, no, not really. Why?

12:33.294 --> 12:35.921
Because we have a record of you
getting a ticket near Angeles Forest

12:36.005 --> 12:37.548
where Steve's body was found.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.759
You do?

12:39.842 --> 12:42.887
Can I ask why you were
in Antelope Valley at that time?

12:43.679 --> 12:44.680
Oh, God.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.808
What was I-- I was, um…

12:47.892 --> 12:48.726
I, uh…

12:48.809 --> 12:50.895
-I--

12:50.978 --> 12:54.857
-It was a girls' weekend. Scone?
-Oh, yes, please. I love snacks.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.027
-For you.
-A girls' weekend in Antelope Valley.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.069
-Yep.
-Yeah.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.113
For when you wanna get away,
but not too far away.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.824
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-'Cause you have kids and stress.

13:03.908 --> 13:04.742
Down.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.036
Of course.
Who doesn't love a quick getaway?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.579
-Right?
-I mean, I don't.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.706
-Oh.
-Just ask my wife. Ex-wife.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.709
Yeah. Well-- 

13:13.793 --> 13:15.252
So, just the two of you, then?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.378
-Yes.
-Mm. No.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.297
-Hmm?
-We were with our friend Jeff.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.216
-It was a girls' and gay's weekend.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.051
-There was lots of rosé.
-Right.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.678
-"Rosé all day," remember that?
-You were all, "Hey!"

13:24.762 --> 13:27.014
I was like, "Rosé all day!"
He's like, "Don't do that."

13:27.097 --> 13:28.057
Yeah, then she threw up.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.392
-Jeff.
-Yeah, so, you know, this one.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.145
-Pregnancy brains. So boop, forgets.
-Oh!

13:33.229 --> 13:35.564
-Wow, you're pregnant.
-She is.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.733
-I am. I am.
-Yeah. Yeah.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.485
I know. I'm a hundred.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.821
-So she gets really tired, as do I.
-Mm-hmm.

13:43.072 --> 13:43.989
She has cancer.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.407
-You do?
-I do.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.701
Super sad. 

13:48.410 --> 13:51.747
So, we're just a bunch of tired,
rundown gals.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.666
Now I get the house hat.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.583
-Mm. Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.669
-I'm so sorry, Judy.
-Thank you, Glenn.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.047
Look, I'm gonna let you two get some rest.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.467
If you think of anything else
that might be helpful, just gimme a call.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.718
Here to help.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.428
-I'll walk you out.
-Oh, thank you.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.138
Ooh, if I can. No, just kidding.

14:10.724 --> 14:15.020
Well, thank you so much for coming.
I hope you got everything that you need.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.481
Time will tell. Oh, wow.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.525
-Is that one of yours?
-Yeah.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.695
Ah, it's beautiful.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.405
-Thank you.
-Hm.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.702
Well, you might wanna get
a new frame though.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.996
That one's cracked.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.917
Oh, yeah, I… 

14:37.001 --> 14:40.462
…dropped it when I was trying to hang it.
Ol' butterfingers over here.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.922
-Right.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.174
And also, Glenn,
I don't wanna play the cance card,

14:44.258 --> 14:47.136
but wow, you know, they, like,

14:47.219 --> 14:50.055
shoot all that stuff into you,
and you just get so weak.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.433
-Aww.
-Gets, like, porous bones.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.644
Throwing up, no good news.
Hard to hang art.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.021
-Oh, Jesus.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.023
-Yeah, it's terrible.
-Okay, well, thanks again.

14:59.106 --> 14:59.982
Yeah!

15:00.065 --> 15:03.152
Oh, and you know, maybe no more
quick getaways for a minute.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.071
Might come back around
and ask a few follow-up questions.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.281
Right, yeah, of course.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.867
I mean, we're here.
We're not going anywhere.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.536
-Yeah.
-Just, uh, be here, hanging out.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.332
-You know where to find us. Obvs.
-I do know where to find you. Obvs.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.503
Oh, my God, he knows.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.005
We don't know what he knows.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.966
I mean, he didn't arrest anyone.
We're still here, right?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.093
Yeah, well, obviously,
we can't go anywhere now.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.596
And why-- why did you tell him
that I was pregnant?

15:30.679 --> 15:33.599
-Ben doesn't even know that, Judy.
-Well, it's a good cover.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.601
-And why would you bring up Jeff?
-He's an alibi.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.770
We weren't with him that weekend.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.356
He was with his child bride
of a boyfriend!

15:40.439 --> 15:42.566
So, we'll ask him
to corroborate the story.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.069
Oh, my God.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.113
-Where's my Number One Mom mug?
-What?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.366
My motherfucking Number One Mom mug!
Where is it?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.786
-Uh, it's around here somewhere--
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.955
Holy shit!
Holy shit, it's gone. He took it.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.831
-What? Who?
-Agent Moranis.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.166
-Glenn?
-Yeah, he took it.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.251
And now he's gonna match the DNA!

16:01.335 --> 16:02.670
-Oh, my God.
-Where did he put it?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.046
-Down his fucking pants?
-Maybe.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.048
-I mean, they were chinos.
-They were.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.008
Oh, my God.
They're gonna know I did it.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.470
And I'm gonna give birth
in a jail cell, chained to my bed.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.555
No, no, no, no.
You are not going to jail, okay?

16:13.639 --> 16:16.433
We just need to calm down.
There is always a way out.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.352
You're right.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.270
Here's what we do.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.189
-We kill Glenn.
-We check the dining room. What?

16:22.272 --> 16:23.315
We kill him.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.569
We goodbye him forever, all right?
It's the only way.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.406
Jen, we are not killing Glenn.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.783
-No, we make it look like an accident.
-What?

16:32.866 --> 16:35.786
Yes, like, uh, an overdose
or something, with-- with the pills.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.246
-Okay. Yes.
-What pills?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.790
The pain pills
that you stole from the hospital.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.544
We can mash 'em up and--
and bake 'em up into a scone or something.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.170
If only I could find the damn--

16:45.254 --> 16:46.755
Oh, here it is!

16:49.591 --> 16:51.927
That-- when-- where did it-- where?

16:52.636 --> 16:54.388
It was in-- in the sink.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.932
-Oh.
-Under a bowl.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.225
Well, that makes sense.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.351
Yeah.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.521
So, I guess we won't be needing these.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.439
No.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.774
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.208
-Jen?
-Jeff.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.418
-Jen.
-Jeff.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.753
-Judy.
-Hi.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.838
Uh, sorry to just show up like this, but--

17:27.921 --> 17:29.757
No, no, no. <i>Mi RV es su RV.</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.341
-Okay.
-Please, right this way.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.553
-Join me on the lanai.
-It's a parking lot, but we're not--

17:34.636 --> 17:36.680
-It's not really beach weather.
-Okay.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.724
'Cause it's pretty windy, but--

17:38.807 --> 17:41.351
So, Jeff--

17:41.435 --> 17:42.853
-So, I'm hanging in.
-Okay.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.855
It's been emotional. Selling the house.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.106
Ending things with Seb.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.984
-Sebastian.
-Aww.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.903
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
-Oh, wow.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.698
He seemed so nice when we met him
when we were all at that hotel together.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.533
Mm-hmm. That entire weekend.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.869
Oh, right. Those were dark days.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.704
Sneaking around. Lying.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.790
Don't need to revisit that weekend again.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.335
-Well, you might have to, actually.
-Mm-hmm.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.545
With the FBI, actually.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.798
The FBI?
Why would I need to talk to the FBI?

18:10.881 --> 18:14.468
-Uh, that's, uh, because they--
-Uh, 'cause… they're--

18:14.551 --> 18:15.677
Did Karen put you up to this?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.638
-What?
-Trying to get me in trouble, isn't she?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.057
-Yep.
-She sure is.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.308
She cannot let go.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.977
I mean, sure,
I cheated on her multiple times.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.396
There may have been a bit
of methamphetamines that weekend.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.981
It was just one time a couple of times.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.360
-Okay, so here's the thing-- Hmm?
-She probably had me followed, didn't she?

18:31.443 --> 18:32.736
Someone take pictures? Jesus.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.280
Now she's gonna use it
all against me in the divorce, isn't she?

18:35.364 --> 18:39.034
No, not if you say that you were with us

18:39.118 --> 18:40.744
on, um, a girls' weekend.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.997
Right. I mean, we could be your alibi.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.207
Alibi. Yeah.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.710
Jeff, do you have any more Absolut?
Because I'm making martoonis.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.920
-Jen?
-Christopher.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.588
-Judy?
-Hi.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.885
So, in any event, uh, thank you.
I so appreciate you ladies having my back.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.847
I owe you one. I guess I owe you two.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.015
Well, why-- why do you owe me two?

19:02.099 --> 19:06.270
I was going to mention it,
and then, you know, I didn't.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.647
Remember the street camera footage
you asked me to delete?

19:10.274 --> 19:12.401
You should see the resolution
on our street cam.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.944
Kind of a home safety nerd.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.363
-How do you erase it?
-I don't. I keep it all in the cloud.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.907
<i>Cloud. Cloud. Cloud. Cloud.</i>

19:20.033 --> 19:21.034
Yeah?

19:21.118 --> 19:23.078
I didn't delete it.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.623
Delete footage? What'd you do this time?
Murder a man in cold blood?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.586
That's a good one.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.423
-Oh! Ow!

19:34.506 --> 19:37.384
Anyway, I tried,
but Karen reset our cloud password.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.510
-Oh, fuck.
-Oh!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.387
As you know,
she can be very vindictive.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.056
Especially when she's in that house,
all alone with her guns.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.308
Right.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.685
Anyway, thank you so much for stopping by.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.355
Christopher.

19:51.064 --> 19:51.940
Bye.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.775
Beautiful lanai.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.669
-Hello… friend.
-Hi.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.712
Hi.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.672
Thinking you
might be up for a little visit.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.590
Mm-hmm.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.259
Is that… Mexican lasagna?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.637
-With extra raisins.
-Thank you.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.932
Mmm. Do you wanna come in?

20:25.015 --> 20:26.433
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.602
I was just telling Judy
about your safe room.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.853
Love to see it.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.650
And this is from
when Jeff and I went to Key West.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.692
Mm-hmm.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.611
-Aww.
-Mm-hmm.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.405
And this is
when we went to Fire Island.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.284
Jeff.
He looks good, don't you think?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.535
You know what?

20:45.619 --> 20:49.373
Karen, uh, I'm gonna say this
to you as your… friend.

20:49.456 --> 20:53.293
You really--
you gotta stop dwelling.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.419
Oh, my God, Karen.

20:54.503 --> 20:58.006
You know what? If I were you, honestly,
I would just erase the whole cloud.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.424
-The whole thing.
-Yeah.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.509
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.095
Yeah, yeah. I mean, the cloud is the past.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.389
-Mm-hmm.
-That's what's holding you back, Kare.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.016
-Yeah.
-Aww, Jeff used to call me that.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.810
He called me his little Kare package.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.812
Fuck Jeff! Fuck that guy.

21:11.895 --> 21:12.771
He never let me.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.691
Oh, jeez. So, guess what. Let's dump him.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.734
-Yes, right in the trash.
-Dump him. 

21:17.818 --> 21:20.362
I need to think about it.
I'm-- I'm not spontaneous.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.863
-I'm a planner!

21:21.947 --> 21:23.615
I mean, hello, I built a safe room!

21:23.699 --> 21:26.660
Yeah, like,
what exactly are you planning for?

21:26.743 --> 21:28.161
The apocalypse.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.621
-Right.
-Cool.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.667
-Yeah. I mean, so prepared. Right.
-That's, like, such forward-thinking.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.794
But for the first time
in my personal life,

21:35.877 --> 21:37.713
I-- I have no idea what's coming.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.008
And I'm not sure
I wanna find out, you know?

21:42.217 --> 21:43.760
It's just all too scary.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.804
I get it.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.557
You got this, Kare bear, okay?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.600
You just gotta do one step at a time.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.477
Yeah, you know what?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.980
Why don't you just start
with erasing last year?

21:55.063 --> 21:56.732
Oh, my G-- um, yes.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.735
Can we admit
that this was a shitty year?

21:59.818 --> 22:01.153
-Yeah.
-It really was.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.487
Shitty last couple of years.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.281
-Sucked. Mm-hmm.
-Really bad.

22:06.742 --> 22:10.579
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.331
-Okay.
-You can do it.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.915
-We have faith in you.
-Come on.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.959
-You got this.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.045
-You got it. Just drag it!

22:18.128 --> 22:19.713
-You did it!
-Yay!

22:19.796 --> 22:22.507
-Look at you!
-Look, doesn't that feel good?

22:22.591 --> 22:25.260
-Wow!
-It does. It does!

22:25.344 --> 22:28.138
And if I wanna see it again,
I-- I have it backed up on my hard drive.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.141
-You know we're gonna have to take this.
-Yeah, we'll keep it safe.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.107
What do people do to relax
when they can't drink?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.692
I don't know.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.986
Can I take a lick of one of these?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.488
-Ooh, I wouldn't.
-Oh, come on.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.114
-Just a little tiny lick.
-Mm-mm.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.492
-Oh, man.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.286
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.706
I'm just a tired, rundown gal.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.835
Hey, uh, when is your scan?
You didn't tell me.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.464
Oh, that's 'cause, um,
haven't made the appointment yet.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.049
What? Why?

23:04.132 --> 23:07.594
Judy, come on, we've gone through this.
You have to follow up.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.846
I know. I just--

23:10.347 --> 23:11.681
I don't…

23:12.724 --> 23:14.518
-I don't wanna know.
-Oh.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.478
I just wanna stay here.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.482
-In my safe room.
-Oh, girlie.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.985
We aren't at the apocalypse yet, okay?

23:24.069 --> 23:25.153
What if it's coming?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.490
What if it's not good?

23:31.201 --> 23:33.412
Then we fucking fight.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.496
Like we do.

23:35.414 --> 23:39.334
'Cause we are a couple of badass,

23:40.127 --> 23:43.463
pregnant, cancerous bitches.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.548
Okay?

23:44.631 --> 23:45.465
Okay.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.775
<i>Laguna Oncology.</i>
<i>Thanks for holding.</i>

24:03.859 --> 24:05.819
Hi. Hi. This is Judy Hale.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.655
I'm calling to schedule my PET-CT scan.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.906
<i>One moment, please.</i>

24:09.990 --> 24:11.032
Thank you.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.993
Oh, fuck.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.291
Look, I don't know how to tell you this,
but…

25:01.374 --> 25:04.544
…I found something upsetting
on my street cam footage.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.629
You did?

25:06.546 --> 25:08.465
I mean,
I'm thinking about going to the police,

25:08.548 --> 25:10.926
but I thought
it was only fair to warn you.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.511
Warn me about what?

25:12.594 --> 25:16.181
You never know what kind of sicko
is living right next door.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.350
-Karen…
-Hang on. Now, where…

25:18.892 --> 25:20.852
-Karen.
-Oh, wait, let me favorite that one.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.771
-You need to do that now?
-Oh, that's cute.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.606
-Oh, for fuck's sake. Karen.

25:24.689 --> 25:25.607
Oh, here.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.068
Look at this.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.950
-Hmm?

25:42.165 --> 25:45.460
Jen, we can't let this guy buy my house.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.419
No.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.546
No.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.130
-No.
-No.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.423
I mean…

25:50.507 --> 25:52.759
…what kind of creep goes
through someone's garbage?

25:52.842 --> 25:55.136
With gloves and everything? Gloves.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.514
-This is premeditated.
-Yeah.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.724
Now you see why I own so many guns?

25:59.808 --> 26:02.644
I do. Yeah.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.646
Yeah.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.198
Mrs. Harding.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.327
Hello again. Brought you something.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.787
Oh, scones.
