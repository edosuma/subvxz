Did it ever occur to you
to pick up a phone and call me?

38:06.660 --> 38:08.651
I did call. Twice.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.865
Lana hung up on me
before I could get a word out.

38:17.379 --> 38:19.540
Do you even know
when you're lying anymore?

38:20.799 --> 38:23.711
I've stopped pretending
to care whether or not you believe me...

38:23.885 --> 38:26.547
...so why don't you?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.808
Because I do care, Lex.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.230
And there's a side of you
that knows what's right.

38:37.607 --> 38:38.722
Wow.

38:38.900 --> 38:42.518
Now, what would I do without Clark Kent,
voice of reason?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.899
That voice isn't me, Lex, it's you.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.737
There's still good inside you.
Let that voice lead you back to it.

38:50.245 --> 38:54.659
I didn't know it would only take
a brush with death to see your softer side.

38:57.877 --> 39:01.415
Trust me, Lex, there's nothing that's lost
that can't be found again.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.696
Anything good?

39:30.410 --> 39:31.445
Um....

39:31.619 --> 39:33.951
Supposedly,
this is one of my favorite songs...

39:34.122 --> 39:36.238
...and I don't even remember
how it goes.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.205
Lex, I saw what happened.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.838
You were bleeding.

39:46.009 --> 39:49.297
I told you,
I know some talented doctors.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.220
Obviously, you do.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.555
So I guess I used to work here.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.315
I wonder if they'll give me my job back.

40:04.486 --> 40:07.819
Well, I think the owner will understand.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.318
Thank you for meeting me.

-I mean, home isn't feeling very--
-Familiar?

40:18.958 --> 40:20.368
Yeah.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.869
I mean, Clark seems like a really nice guy
and everything...

40:24.047 --> 40:26.789
...but I can't help but feeling
he's hiding something from me.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.172
Heh.

40:28.843 --> 40:32.802
As his former best friend,
I know the feeling all too well.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.097
See, Clark didn't even mention
that you guys were friends.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.139
What happened?

40:43.399 --> 40:45.139
I grew up.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.106
Kara...

40:49.697 --> 40:52.029
...l'm not interested in keeping secrets.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.534
This treatment will help
get your memories back.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.491
And with it, we'll get the truth.
