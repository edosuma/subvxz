00:02.330 --> 00:05.322
*

00:06.140 --> 00:07.630
- DAD?

00:07.670 --> 00:09.535
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

00:09.570 --> 00:13.006
- COME HERE.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

00:16.610 --> 00:19.272
WOW, 150-DEGREE TEMPERATURE.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.447
- I'M PROBABLY TOO SICK TO GO
TO JIMMY PEOPLES' HOUSE.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.812
YOU BE'I'I'ER CALL AND CANCEL.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.249
- YEAH, RIGHT AFTER THAT,
I'LL CALL THE CORONER.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.508
150-DEGREE TEMPERATURE,
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN WALKING.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.959
-IAM?

00:28.990 --> 00:31.458
- YEAH, I GIVE YOU
5, 10 MINUTES TO LIVE, TOPS.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.197
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
THIS HAPPENED SOON ENOUGH

00:34.230 --> 00:35.891
FOR YOUR MOTHER AND I
TO START OVER AGAIN.

00:35.930 --> 00:38.763
MAYBE THIS TIME
WE'LL HAVE A GIRL.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.665
- HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS FAKING?

00:40.700 --> 00:42.167
- WELL, SHAWN,
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE

00:42.210 --> 00:44.098
WAS STICKING THE THERMOMETER
IN BOILING WATER.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.131
NEXT TIME, TRY PUTTING IT
IN A HOT SANDWICH

00:46.180 --> 00:47.431
OR BEHIND THE TELEVISION.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.607
AND WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO TO JIMMY'S?

00:49.650 --> 00:50.901
THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH
TO INVITE US OVER.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.168
- THEY'RE THE WEIRDEST FAMILY
ON THE ENTIRE BLOCK.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.144
- SHAWN, THERE IS SOMETHING
WEIRD ABOUT EVERY FAMILY.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.646
THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.112
- THEY EAT WEIRD FOOD.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.116
- ALL FOOD IS WEIRD
UNTIL YOU TRY IT.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.980
- I MEAN,
THEY DON'T EVEN EAT MEAT.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.679
- YOU MEAN THEY'RE VEGETARIANS.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.119
- I THINK THEY CALL IT "VEGAN."

01:07.160 --> 01:09.993
- YOU GUYS READY
FOR SOME BARBECUE TOFU?

01:10.030 --> 01:12.897
- [coughing]

01:12.940 --> 01:15.192
I THINK I GOT
THAT SAME THING YOU GOT.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.931
[chatter over radios]

01:25.480 --> 01:27.175
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.744
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN,
FOR HELPING OUT.

01:28.780 --> 01:29.781
- DON'T MENTION IT, CHIEF.

01:29.820 --> 01:30.844
SEARCH AND RESCUE
IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.949
- OUR MISSING PERSON
IS WARREN CLAYTON.

01:32.990 --> 01:34.355
- THE BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR?

01:34.390 --> 01:35.516
- YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.289
- HIS HEDGE FUND HAS HAD
AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURN

01:37.330 --> 01:38.888
OF 20% FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.898
- MR. CLAYTON'S PRIVATE PLANE
LOST CONTACT

01:40.930 --> 01:42.795
WITH THE TOWER
AROUND 0700.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.889
AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT HIS PLANE CRASHED

01:44.930 --> 01:46.488
SOMEWHERE IN THESE MOUNTAINS.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.168
NOW, MR. SPENCER,
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.802
I NEED TO KNOW OF ANY SIGNALS
THAT YOU PICK UP

01:50.840 --> 01:51.829
THAT CAN LEAD US TO HIM.

01:51.870 --> 01:54.134
OKAY, PEOPLE, OUR WINDOW

01:54.180 --> 01:56.478
OF FINDING CLAYTON ALIVE
IS CLOSING.

01:56.510 --> 01:57.875
SO LET'S MOVE ON OUT.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.743
- FACE IT, SPENCER,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE

02:00.780 --> 02:02.645
OF FINDING THAT DOWNED PLANE
BEFORE WE DO.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.614
BUT, UH,
HAVE A NICE WALK.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.049
LET'S GO.

02:15.660 --> 02:16.968
- NOTE TO SELF:

02:17.000 --> 02:18.422
GET ONE OF THOSE
FOR THE OFFICE.

02:18.470 --> 02:19.789
- I HOPE YOU HAVE A PLAN
AS TO HOW

02:19.840 --> 02:21.398
WE'RE GOING TO FIND
THIS CRASHED PLANE.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.702
AND I HOPE THAT PLAN
DOESN'T END UP

02:22.740 --> 02:24.207
WITH US BEING EATEN
BY A BEAR.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.003
- DON'T WORRY, GUS.
WE HAVE A SECRET WEAPON.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.200
- A LARGER, BEAR-EATING BEAR?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.276
- BOOM!
- A MAP?

02:29.310 --> 02:30.607
THAT'S YOUR SECRET WEAPON?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.278
- THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL MAP,
MY FRIEND.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.776
[grunts]
WITH LARGE WORDS

02:34.820 --> 02:36.117
THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND,

02:36.150 --> 02:38.789
LIKE "LATITU DINAL"
AND "EAST."

02:38.820 --> 02:41.584
THIS HERE IS A MAP
FROM MY FATHER'S HUNTSMAN CLUB.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.349
THESE OLD GEEZERS
MAKE THEIR OWN MAPS

02:43.390 --> 02:46.359
WITH TRAILS AND PATHS,
LANDMARKS,

02:46.400 --> 02:47.958
THAT GOVERNMENT MAPS
DON'T EVEN HAVE.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.422
WE WILL USE THESE SHORTCUTS

02:49.470 --> 02:51.062
TO COVER MORE GROUND
THAN THE COPS CAN.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.465
- SWEET.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.074
[crash]
- WHOA, WHOA.

03:00.110 --> 03:02.032
THAT SOUNDED BIG.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.210
[crash]

03:09.250 --> 03:11.639
- THAT'S A BEAR.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

03:11.690 --> 03:13.578
[whipping]
- OW! STOP!

03:13.620 --> 03:15.451
[both grunting]

03:15.490 --> 03:16.980
I'M NOT GONNA BE
THE ONE THAT GETS EATEN!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.055
- ME EITHER!

03:19.090 --> 03:20.626
[bang bang]

03:20.660 --> 03:23.026
- DID THAT SOUND LIKE METAL
TO YOU?

03:23.070 --> 03:24.719
- IT DID.

03:30.170 --> 03:35.107
[banging]

03:35.140 --> 03:36.209
- THAT'S HIM.
- DUDE.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.275
- DUDE, WE'RE HEROES.

03:41.450 --> 03:42.940
RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY, MR. CLAYTON.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.389
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

03:44.420 --> 03:47.412
[beeping]

03:47.460 --> 03:49.280
- NO SIGNAL!
- ALL RIGHT, SIR.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.558
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.991
JUST TRY TO HOLD STILL.

03:54.030 --> 03:55.349
- [pained breathing]

04:02.240 --> 04:05.732
NEEDED TO MAKE AMENDS.

04:05.770 --> 04:10.070
GOOD FATHER.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

04:10.110 --> 04:12.874
- UH, YOU KNOW, GOOD FATHER'S
KIND OF A TRICKY SUBJECT FOR ME.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.047
UH, TRY TO CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY,
MR. CLAYTON.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.172
- [coughing and wheezing]

04:16.220 --> 04:18.381
WATERLOO.
- HE'S AN ABBA FAN.

04:20.220 --> 04:24.020
- FIND OUT WHO KILLED ME.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.687
- NO, NO, NO, MR. CLAYTON.
OPEN YOUR EYES.

04:25.730 --> 04:27.152
STAY WITH US HERE.
- WATCH OUT, SHAWN.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.464
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
MR. CLAYTON. MR. CLAYTON.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.819
WHAT INDUSTRY SECTORS
DO YOU SEE

04:30.870 --> 04:32.121
OUTPERFORMING THE MARKET
THIS YEAR?

04:32.170 --> 04:33.489
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

04:33.540 --> 04:36.100
- I'M TRYING TO GIVE HIM
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT, SHAWN.

04:36.140 --> 04:38.233
- WELL, IT DIDN'T WORK.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.432
HE'S DEAD.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.243
- WELL, THAT'S A LOSE-LOSE.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.147
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:48.180 --> 04:49.112
*

04:49.150 --> 04:50.686
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:50.720 --> 04:52.187
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

04:52.220 --> 04:54.108
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:54.160 --> 04:55.513
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:55.560 --> 04:57.050
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:57.090 --> 04:58.887
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:58.930 --> 05:00.454
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

05:00.500 --> 05:03.321
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

05:03.370 --> 05:06.259
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

05:17.750 --> 05:19.775
- ALL RIGHT, LOWER THE BASKET
AS SOON AS YOU'RE IN POSITION.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.742
- SEE YOU BACK AT BASE CAMP.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.112
- IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS NOW.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.411
- NOT SO FAST.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.587
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN
A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.154
- HOW SO?

05:32.190 --> 05:34.090
- WARREN CLAYTON'S DYING WISH.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.223
MAN, WHAT IF THAT HAD BEEN
YOUR DAD?

05:36.260 --> 05:37.625
OR MY DAD?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.319
AND SOME OTHER RANDOM BLACK GUY
AND WHITE GUY

05:39.370 --> 05:40.667
FOUND HIM WITH ONE BREATH LEFI'?

05:40.700 --> 05:42.668
WOULDN'T YOU WANT THOSE DUDES
TO FULFILL

05:42.710 --> 05:44.302
OUR DADS' FINAL WISH?

05:44.340 --> 05:45.568
ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS ABOUT US?

05:45.610 --> 05:47.373
- YOU THINK OF ME
AS SOME RANDOM BLACK DUDE?

05:47.410 --> 05:49.401
- MAN, WE GO'I'I'A FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.008
WHAT DID HE MEAN?

05:51.050 --> 05:53.678
I MEAN, WAS HE POISONED
BEFORE TAKEOFF,

05:53.720 --> 05:55.449
OR--OR WAS HE INCAPACITATED,

05:55.480 --> 05:56.879
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE
PARACHUTED OUT?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.740
- OR MAYBE IT WAS A--
- IT WASN'T A BEAR.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.257
- I WASN'T GOING
TO SAY THAT, SHAWN.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.882
- WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

06:08.460 --> 06:10.462
- MRS. CLAYTON,
WE KNOW YOU WANT ANSWERS.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.922
BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,
THESE THINGS DO TAKE TIME.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.631
- PLEASE.
IT ONLY TAKES MONEY.

06:13.670 --> 06:16.935
HAVE YOU FOUND SATELLITE IMAGING
OF THE PLANE BEFORE IT CRASHED?

06:16.970 --> 06:18.335
HAVE YOU RUN
A WEATHER SIMULATION?

06:18.370 --> 06:20.600
- REST ASSURED THAT THE SANTA
BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

06:20.640 --> 06:22.107
IS PU'I'I'ING ALL AVAILABLE
RESOURCES ON THIS.

06:22.140 --> 06:25.143
- [clears throat]
ALMOST ALL OF ITS RESOURCES.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.375
HELLO, MY NAME
IS SHAWN SPENCER.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.546
I'M THE DEPARTMENT PSYCHIC.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.048
MRS. CLAYTON, I'M RECEIVING

06:31.090 --> 06:32.785
A PSYCHIC TRANSMISSION
FROM YOUR HUSBAND.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.515
IT'S REALLY MORE
OF A VOICE MAIL,

06:34.560 --> 06:35.709
IF I'M BEING HONEST.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.751
A STATUS UPDATE.
PERHAPS A TWITTER.

06:37.790 --> 06:38.950
- I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED
A TWEET.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.059
- THERE'S NO WAY
I'M SAYING THAT.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.328
- IS HE FOR REAL?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.567
- IN SPITE OF MR. SPENCER'S
FIRST IMPRESSION,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.864
HE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO
LED US TO YOUR HUSBAND'S PLANE.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.198
- HE KNEW WHAT CLOTHES
YOUR HUSBAND WAS WEARING,

06:48.240 --> 06:50.208
HOW HIS BODY WAS POSITIONED,
EVEN WHAT COLOGNE HE WAS--

06:50.240 --> 06:51.798
- I KNEW WHAT COLOGNE
HE WAS WEARING.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.331
I MEAN, HE DID.
- [winces]

06:54.380 --> 06:58.043
- WELL, LET'S HEAR THIS SUPPOSED
MESSAGE FROM MY HUSBAND.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.116
- IT'S A LITTLE CLOUDY, UH...

07:00.150 --> 07:01.174
WARREN IS VERY UPSET.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.017
HE'S SAYING...

07:03.050 --> 07:05.189
"MURDER." HE'S SAYING "MURDER."
- SHAWN.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.778
- DOES THE WORD "WATERLOO"

07:06.820 --> 07:09.527
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU,
MRS. CLAYTON?

07:09.560 --> 07:11.084
- ALL RIGHT, SPENCER,
YOU'VE WASTED ENOUGH

07:11.130 --> 07:12.495
OF MRS. CLAYTON'S TIME
WITH YOUR NONSENSE.

07:12.530 --> 07:13.554
- NO, WAIT.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.454
I-I'M REALLY QUITE SHOCKED.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.058
- YOU ARE?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.727
- YES, IT JUST DOESN'T SHOW
ON MY FACE

07:18.770 --> 07:19.998
BECAUSE OF YEARS OF BOTOX.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.338
- AH.
- WATERLOO IS THE NAME

07:22.370 --> 07:23.928
OF THE 18th HOLE
AT OUR COUNTRY CLUB.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.904
WARREN MENTIONED
JUST A WEEK AGO

07:25.940 --> 07:27.737
THAT HE WANTED HIS ASHES
SPREAD THERE.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.839
- YES, OF COURSE.
- STRANGE.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.542
- NOT STRANGE.
PSYCHIC ACUMEN.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.218
- YOU WILL SOLVE THE MYSTERY

07:34.250 --> 07:36.115
OF WHY
MY HUSBAND'S PLANE CRASHED.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.311
- TECHNICALLY, MR. SPENCER'S
NOT BEEN HIRED--

07:38.350 --> 07:40.318
- THIS NO LONGER CONCERNS
THE POLICE,

07:40.360 --> 07:42.828
AS I WILL BE FINANCING
MR. SPENCER'S OPERATIONS.

07:42.860 --> 07:45.727
I AM SURE THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY
IS BETTER SPENT

07:45.760 --> 07:48.797
ON SOME SOCIAL PROGRAM,
OR A TREE.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.991
WHAT RESOURCES
WILL YOU BE NEEDING?

07:53.970 --> 07:56.803
A CASE OF RED VINES,
INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.673
TWO, MINI FRIDGE
FILLED WITH CACT US COOLER.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.132
NEED A SHAMWOW.
- A NEW LAPTOP.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.329
TELL HER WE NEED
A NEW LAPTOP.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.007
A NEW LAPTOP,
PREFERABLY ONE

08:04.050 --> 08:05.506
MADE OF RED VINES.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.313
- GENTLEMEN,
YOU ARE NO LONGER LIMITED

08:07.350 --> 08:08.942
BY A POLICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.119
TELL ME WHAT IT WILL TAKE
TO GET THIS DONE QUICKLY.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.708
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,

08:12.760 --> 08:14.557
I'LL NEED TO BECOME
WARREN CLAYTON.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.649
GO WHERE HE'D GO,
DO WHAT HE'D DO,

08:16.690 --> 08:18.248
SEE WHAT HE'D SEE.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.427
- VERY WELL.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.121
YOU WILL START YOUR WORK
BY BEING MY GUESTS

08:21.160 --> 08:22.923
AT DINNER TONIGHT
AT MY ESTATE.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.495
- THE ESTATE.
- SAY WHAT?

08:25.530 --> 08:27.066
- I'LL SEND THE CAR
TO PICK YOU UP.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.091
- THE CAR.
- OH, NICE.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.164
- THE DOOR.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.701
- THE DOOR.
- [chuckles] BIG DOOR.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.106
- THE DOOR.
- OH, YES, OF COURSE, THE DOOR.

08:36.910 --> 08:38.548
[clears throat]

08:40.950 --> 08:42.042
GET OUT OF HERE.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.178
AS I GENTLY HELD HIS SKULL,

08:49.220 --> 08:51.120
WHICH WAS FRACTURED
IN SEVERAL PLACES,

08:51.160 --> 08:54.152
I WAS ABLE TO KEEP
DEATH'S COLD CLUTCH

08:54.200 --> 08:56.794
FROM ENVELOPING CLAYTON
JUST LONG ENOUGH

08:56.830 --> 08:59.367
FOR HIM TO EXPRESS
HIS DYING WISH.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.039
- SHAWN, THAT IS REVISIONIST
HISTORY AND YOU KNOW IT.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.958
- I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE.
- I WAS THERE.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.534
- IT'S OKAY, GUS.
WHEN HE EMBELLISHES--

09:05.570 --> 09:06.969
- LIES.
- CLARIFIES.

09:07.010 --> 09:08.409
- IT LETS ME KNOW
THAT HE CARES.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.603
BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW
IS WHEN CAN I MEET YOUR FATHER?

09:11.650 --> 09:13.515
- [giggIeSJ
- [clears throat]

09:13.550 --> 09:16.849
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FATHER
IS, UH, IS COMPLICATED.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.814
- [scoffs]
- AS I BELIEVE I'VE MENTIONED.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.657
AND I KNOW YOU--
YOU'LL WANNA GET IN THERE

09:21.690 --> 09:23.055
AND FIX EVERYTHING.

09:23.090 --> 09:25.854
AND NO AMOUNT OF TALKING
OR LISTENING OR HUGGING

09:25.890 --> 09:27.596
IS GOING TO FIX ANYTHING
BETWEEN ME AND MY DAD.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.120
I'M SORRY.
- OKAY.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.720
I HEAR YOU, AND I'M GOING
TO STOP PRESSURING YOU.

09:31.770 --> 09:32.759
- THANK YOU.

09:32.800 --> 09:33.892
BESIDES, YOU ALREADY KNOW

09:33.940 --> 09:35.965
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT ME.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.400
I'M REALLY
QUITE A SIMPLE MAN.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.874
- MR. SPENCER'S PRIVATE CAR
IS HERE

09:40.910 --> 09:42.537
TO TAKE HIM
TO THE CLAYTON ESTATE.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.502
- THANK YOU, MY GOOD MAN.
- WE ARE READY.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.287
- [wolf whistles]

09:52.320 --> 09:54.459
- DINNER WILL BE SERVED
SHORTLY.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.117
- THANK YOU.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.589
- NOTE TO SELF:
BE RICH ONE DAY.

10:02.630 --> 10:04.894
- THIS IS WHAT REAL CLASS
LOOKS LIKE, SHAWN.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.433
- YEAH, I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN A MUSEUM

10:07.470 --> 10:09.631
FILLED WITH PRICELESS ARTIFACT S.

10:09.670 --> 10:12.207
ONLY HERE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TOUCH OR PLAY WITH ANYTHING.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.630
BUT, UH, LET'S NOT BE
BLINDED BY THE BLING, GUS.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.104
REMEMBER, WE'RE HERE TO FULFILL
MR. CLAYTON'S DYING WISH.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.243
FIND OUT WHO IT WAS
THAT MURDERED HIM.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.315
- IF HE WAS EVEN MURDERED.

10:22.350 --> 10:23.942
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE WAS HALLUCINATING

10:23.990 --> 10:25.878
WHEN HE SAID THAT.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.478
- MAKE NO MISTAKE, GUS.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.626
WHEN I CRADLED THE MAN'S HEAD
AND HE BREATHED HIS LAST BREATH,

10:30.660 --> 10:32.321
HE LOOKED RIGHT INTO MY EYES.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.089
AND I AM CERTAIN HE KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS SAYING.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.019
- I WAS THERE, SHAWN.
YOU DIDN'T CRADLE ANYTHING.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.560
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.692
I'M SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.139
I WAS, UH,
PUTTING THINGS AWAY.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.229
SO MANY MEMORIES OF CLAY.

10:43.270 --> 10:45.568
THAT'S WHAT I CALLED HIM.

10:45.610 --> 10:48.499
- IS THAT AN ULTRA-HIGH MODULUS
HYPER CARBON RACKET?

10:48.540 --> 10:50.872
- THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT
FROM HIM LAST YEAR.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.377
HE EVEN SIGNED ME UP FOR
TENNIS LESSONS

10:52.410 --> 10:53.911
WITH MALAVIA.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.315
- MALAVIA WASHINGTON?

10:55.350 --> 10:56.988
THE ONE-TIME WIMBLEDON FINALIST?

10:57.020 --> 10:59.682
- NO.
BUT HE'S A MARVELOUS TEACHER.

10:59.720 --> 11:00.914
I NEVER MISSED A LESSON.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.087
- THANK YOU, MRS. CLAYTON,
FOR INVITING us HERE

11:03.130 --> 11:04.222
TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOME.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.329
- MY PLEASURE.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.384
WE'RE ALL VERY EAGER

11:06.430 --> 11:07.795
TO LEARN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

11:07.830 --> 11:09.559
BEHIND MY HUSBAND'S ACCIDENT.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.068
OUR SON IS BESIDE HIMSELF
ABOUT IT.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.295
GARVIN, REMEMBER
MOMMY TELLING YOU

11:14.340 --> 11:17.400
ABOUT THE PSYCHIC WHO SAW WHY
PAPA'S PLANE CRASHED?

11:17.440 --> 11:18.464
- NO.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.637
- GARVIN.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.806
THAT'S UNUSUAL.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.048
IT'S VERY, UH, HEATHERS.
NO?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.206
WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?
GARV?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.810
- [chuckles]
- GAR? VIN?

11:28.850 --> 11:32.240
- I GET IT, EVEN THOUGH
I WAS, LIKE, ZERO

11:32.290 --> 11:33.712
WHEN THAT MOVIE CAME OUT.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.320
- MAN, STOP TRYING TO LOOK COOL.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.282
- I HAVE PEEPS, SHAWN.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.797
- YOU HAVE TWO PEEPS.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.798
AND ONE OF THEM'S MADE
OUT OF MARSHMALLOW.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.718
MRS. CLAYTON,
YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,

11:43.770 --> 11:45.965
WHO IS THE GIRL
IN THE FAMILY PHOTOS?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.638
- OH, THAT'S MY DAUGHTER,
NYNA.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.035
SHE'S NO LONGER WITH US.

11:49.070 --> 11:51.209
- OH, I'M SO SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.737
- QUIET, EVERYONE.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.704
MR. SPENCER WILL NOW HAVE
A REVELATION

11:58.750 --> 12:01.173
REGARDING THE CAUSE
OF WARREN'S CRASH.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.313
- [muffled] WHAT--
HAVE A REVELATION?

12:03.350 --> 12:04.544
MM. I'M NOT.

12:04.590 --> 12:05.909
NO...

12:05.950 --> 12:08.418
NO, NO, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR THAT.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.018
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
OUR FOIE GRAS YET.

12:10.060 --> 12:13.518
- [laughing]
FOIE GRAS.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.427
- I HAVE TO DECIPHER
PSYCHIC SIGNALS.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.826
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I TAP
INTO YOUR HUSBAND'S AURORA.

12:18.870 --> 12:21.168
TELL ME, MRS. CLAYTON,

12:21.200 --> 12:22.838
DOES HE HAVE A SMOKING JACKET
THAT I COULD WEAR?

12:22.870 --> 12:24.599
DOES HE HAVE DOWN SHEETS,
AND IF SO,

12:24.640 --> 12:26.039
ARE THEY HYPOALLERGENIC,

12:26.070 --> 12:28.538
BECAUSE I WOULD HATE
FOR MY SIGNALS TO GET

12:28.580 --> 12:30.138
ALL SCRAMBLED UP
WHILE I'M SLEEPING HERE

12:30.180 --> 12:31.147
TONIGHT IN YOUR HOME.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.671
- BASED ON YOUR EARLIER DISPLAY,

12:33.720 --> 12:35.642
I EXPECTED
IMMEDIATE RESULTS.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.739
- [coughs] BOGUS.

12:37.790 --> 12:38.814
[coughs] POSER.

12:38.850 --> 12:42.115
- [coughing]

12:42.160 --> 12:43.252
ASTHMA.

12:43.290 --> 12:44.848
- HE'S ALLERGIC
TO RICH WHITE PEOPLE.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.448
SORRY.
- YES.

12:46.490 --> 12:47.752
- AS I WAS SAYING,

12:47.800 --> 12:51.998
I PAY FOR RESULTS,
MR. SPENCER.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.588
MY NEW CHIN IS PROOF OF THAT.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.235
OUR FAMILY NEEDS CLOSURE
BEFORE WARREN'S WILL

12:57.270 --> 12:58.806
IS UNSEALED THIS WEEKEND.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.274
SINCE YOU ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER,
ROSA, WOULD YOU PUT

13:01.310 --> 13:03.369
MR. SPENCER'S FOOD
IN SOME SORT OF A BAG?

13:03.410 --> 13:05.401
WHERE SHALL I HAVE THE CAR
DROP YOU OFF?

13:05.450 --> 13:06.815
- OH, HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.112
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
EXACTLY TWO

13:14.160 --> 13:16.754
OF MY PSYCHIC CHANNELS
ARE CLEARING UP,

13:16.790 --> 13:19.224
AND I AM GETTING SOMETHING.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.251
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.564
- UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH MR. CLAYTON

13:23.600 --> 13:26.262
AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.461
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING
A TENNIS INSTRUCTOR

13:28.500 --> 13:29.569
EVERY WEEK
FOR THE LAST YEAR,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.101
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
PLAYING TENNIS.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.368
THOUGH YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING
WITH BALLS.

13:32.410 --> 13:35.777
I SEE A VERY...
COMPROMISING IMAGE.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.368
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:37.410 --> 13:38.741
- EW.

13:38.780 --> 13:40.611
IS THAT WHY YOU PRACTICE
AT NIGHT?

13:40.650 --> 13:42.743
- THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT ME.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.089
- NO WONDER YOU HAVE SO MANY
SEXY TENNIS OUTFITS.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.747
- OH WAIT, WAIT--I'M NOT GOING
TO SIT HERE AND BE JUDGED.

13:46.790 --> 13:49.088
AND EVEN IF I WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR, IT WOULD BE

13:49.120 --> 13:50.724
BECAUSE WARREN AND I HAD
A LOVELESS MARRIAGE,

13:50.760 --> 13:52.523
AND NOT THROUGH ANY FAULT
OF MY OWN.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.448
- WHERE I COME FROM,
WE DON'T TALK ILL OF THE DEAD.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.264
- I'LL TALK ABOUT HIM
ANY WAY I PLEASE.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.962
IN FACT, NOT THAT I OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.093
BUT BEFORE HE DIED,
THINGS HAD GOTTEN BETTER.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.335
HE WAS TRYING TO BE THE MAN
THAT--THAT I ONCE LOVED.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.872
- ROSA.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.104
FUNNY YOU SHOULD CHIME IN.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.641
YOU KNOW THE CLAYTON'S
PHILANDERING WAYS

14:13.680 --> 14:15.113
BETTER THAN ANYONE,
SEEING AS HOW

14:15.150 --> 14:18.517
YOU WERE IN FACT
SENOR CLAYTON'S MISTRESS.

14:18.550 --> 14:19.812
- WHAT?
- OH, YES.

14:19.850 --> 14:22.922
THAT'S WHY YOU PRAY
TO ST. DWYNWEN,

14:22.960 --> 14:26.418
THE PATRON SAINT OF DIRTY FILTHY
LOVERS IN THE NIGHTTIME.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.792
- WHO IS THIS MAN?
MAKE ME MAKE HIM LEAVE.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.661
- YOU HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH MY HUSBAND?

14:30.700 --> 14:32.065
HOW DARE YOU!

14:32.100 --> 14:33.658
- [scoffs]
YOU'RE NO BETTER, PUTA.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.497
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.701
YOU PUSHED HIM AWAY
AND HE TOOK IT OUT ON ME.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.833
TAKING AWAY MY PORSCHE,
MAKING ME GET A JOB,

14:39.870 --> 14:41.235
SELLING MY TIGER.
_ OH--

14:41.280 --> 14:42.429
- AND I HATED YOU BOTH.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.277
- YOU BLAME EVERYBODY
FOR YOUR PATHETIC--

14:44.310 --> 14:46.403
- THIS FAMILY
IS CRAZY AS HELL.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.749
- NOW WE SEE WHY WARREN CLAYTON
THOUGHT HE WAS MURDERED.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.453
- AS YOU CAN SEE,
LIKE MOST FAMILIES,

14:54.490 --> 14:56.219
WE HAVE OUR ISSUES.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.319
NOW THAT YOU ARE PRIW
TO THEM,

14:58.360 --> 15:00.521
I EXPECT YOU TO HANDLE THIS
WITH DISCRETION.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.358
WE DO HAVE A PUBLIC IMAGE
TO PROTECT.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.459
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S GOING
TO BE DIFFICULT.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.537
ESPECIALLY ONCE I PROVE
THAT IT WAS ONE OF YOU THREE

15:08.570 --> 15:10.731
WHO KILLED WARREN CLAYTON.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.198
- IS THAT SO?

15:19.150 --> 15:20.640
[Shawn and Gus panting]

15:20.680 --> 15:23.649
[dogs barking and snarling]

15:30.590 --> 15:33.354
- AND HOW IS MY FAVORITE POLICE
DEPARTMENT DOING TODAY?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.960
LASSIE, LOOKING HANDSOME
AND JANGLY.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.423
CHIEF--AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH--

15:38.470 --> 15:40.768
YOU HAVE EXQUISITE TEETH.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.064
- MR. SPENCER, YOU KNOW,
THE LAST I'D HEARD

15:43.110 --> 15:45.465
IS THAT YOU'D TAKEN
AN ASSIGNMENT THAT PROVIDED YOU

15:45.510 --> 15:47.774
WITH MORE FRINGE BENEFITS
THAN WHAT WE COULD GIVE YOU.

15:47.810 --> 15:50.779
- YES, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
MRS. CLAYTON AND I

15:50.810 --> 15:52.448
WERE UNABLE TO SEE
EYE TO EYE.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.209
- IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU GOT FIRED.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.877
- OR MAYBE I WAS GETTING
TOO CLOSE.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.684
- OR MAYBE YOU WERE ACTING
LIKE AN OBNOXIOUS LITTLE TWERP.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.608
- I'M STICKING WITH
GETTING TOO CLOSE.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.287
THOUGH IT IS NICE TO HEAR
THE WORD "TWERP"

16:02.320 --> 16:03.878
HAS SURVIVED THE MILLENNIUM.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.249
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE, CHIEF.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.793
THERE IS MORE
TO WARREN CLAYTON'S PLANE CRASH

16:07.830 --> 16:09.092
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

16:09.130 --> 16:12.122
- FUNNY, THE, UH, NTSB'S
PRELIMINARY REPORT

16:12.170 --> 16:13.592
INDICATES THAT IT WAS
AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT

16:13.640 --> 16:14.732
DUE TO PILOT ERROR.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.590
OH, THE BLACK BOX SHOWS

16:16.640 --> 16:17.937
THAT HE WAS COMING
INTO SANTA BARBARA

16:17.970 --> 16:19.961
AND DESCENDED TOO RAPIDLY.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.704
- TRUST REQUIRES EVIDENCE,
MR. SPENCER.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.545
- I'M GETTING DISTINCT VISIONS.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.877
FAMILY SECRETS.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.412
A LARGE SKELETON
IN A CLOSET.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.054
WARREN CLAYTON WAS TRYING
TO MAKE AMENDS, CHIEF.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.455
BUT HE WAS BEING MET

16:37.490 --> 16:39.549
WITH INFIDELITIES
AND BACKBITING.

16:39.590 --> 16:41.729
AND FRONT BITING.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.988
AND JEALOUSIES.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.419
- OKAY, I SUPPOSE
IT COULDN'T HURT

16:45.470 --> 16:47.893
TO CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY SIGNS OF A COVER-UP,

16:47.940 --> 16:50.636
JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANYTHING
TO HIS PREMONITION.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.331
- CHIEF, COME ON.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.769
YES, MA'AM.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.937
- AND YOU BETTER COME UP WITH
SOMETHING SOON, MR. SPENCER,

16:55.980 --> 16:57.208
OR THIS WILL BE
THE SECOND TIME

16:57.250 --> 16:59.377
THAT YOU'RE FIRED
FROM THE SAME CASE.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.275
- I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE LEAP.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.049
WHAT TIME SHOULD I EXPECT
THE CAR?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.622
YOU THINK YOU GUYS COULD SPRING
FOR A CASE OF RED VINES?

17:10.660 --> 17:12.457
NO. OKAY.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.459
[elegant violin music]

17:15.500 --> 17:18.128
*

17:18.170 --> 17:20.968
- THIS IS HOW I SHOULD BE LIVING
BY NOW, SHAWN.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.695
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

17:22.740 --> 17:24.401
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
GUS,

17:24.440 --> 17:26.829
BUT I WAS BORN
INTO THE WRONG FAMILY.

17:26.870 --> 17:28.804
IF I BELONGED
TO A CLUB LIKE THIS,

17:28.840 --> 17:30.000
I'D HAVE TO CANCEL
MY MEMBERSHIP

17:30.040 --> 17:31.849
ON ACCOUNT OF THEM
LETTING IN THE LIKES OF ME.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.814
AND IF YOU VOTED FOR ME,

17:33.850 --> 17:38.116
WELL, I'M AFRAID YOU
DON'T BELONG IN MY CLUB EITHER.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.038
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

17:40.090 --> 17:42.149
NEITHER DOES "THOO,"
BUT IT IS A WORD.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.282
- NO, IT'S NOT.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.729
THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY
TO BE SURE.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.784
MY POINT IS THIS:

17:45.830 --> 17:47.058
NO MATTER HOW GLAMOROUS

17:47.100 --> 17:48.419
THEIR LIVES LOOK
FROM THE OUTSIDE,

17:48.460 --> 17:51.099
THESE ARE NOT
OUR KIND OF PEOPLE.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.927
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

17:52.970 --> 17:54.437
- TAKE MR. CLAYTON,
FOR EXAMPLE.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.438
HE WAS THE PATRIARCH
OF HIS FAMILY,

17:56.470 --> 17:57.732
YET WHERE WERE THEY

17:57.770 --> 17:59.806
WHEN THE LIFE WAS DRAINING
OUT OF HIS BODY

17:59.840 --> 18:02.729
AND THAT SWEET CHARIOT
HAD SWUNG LOW TO CARRY HIM HOME?

18:02.780 --> 18:06.341
OUT PHILANDERING
AND SOCIAL CLIMBING, I SUSPECT.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.143
MEANWHILE, WHERE WAS I?

18:08.180 --> 18:09.909
I WAS RIGHT THERE
BESIDE HIM.

18:09.950 --> 18:12.282
LIKE A TRUE FRIEND.
- STOP IT.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.550
- I SEE THE TWO OF YOU
DON'T GIVE UP EASILY.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.785
- MRS. CLAYTON.

18:16.820 --> 18:17.980
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT THIS IS NOW

18:18.030 --> 18:19.452
AN OFFICIAL POLICE
INVESTIGATION.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.923
WE'VE BEEN GRANTED FULL ACCESS,

18:20.960 --> 18:22.951
AND IF YOUR FAMILY'S
HIDING ANYTHING ELSE,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.467
WE WILL FIND IT.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.799
- WE DON'T HIDE ANYTHING
EXCEPT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY,

18:27.840 --> 18:30.331
ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN,
AND, UH,

18:30.370 --> 18:32.201
THE FACT THAT WE'RE JEWISH.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.834
WE MAY HAVE A LOT OF SECRETS,

18:34.880 --> 18:37.075
BUT KILLING CLAY
ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.845
THE DOOR.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.246
- [sighs]

18:42.280 --> 18:43.440
- THE DOOR.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.912
- OH, RIGHT, YES.
THE DOOR.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.884
I FORGOT
THAT'S A THING WITH YOU.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.722
- GOOD LUCK GETTING ANYONE HERE
TO TALK TO YOU.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.318
[titters]

18:53.800 --> 18:54.994
- SHE'S RIGHT, SHAWN.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.691
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET PEOPLE
TO TALK TO US?

19:03.940 --> 19:05.009
LET ME GUESS.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.234
YOU'VE GOT
A LOOSELY FORMED IDEA

19:06.270 --> 19:07.578
THAT SHOULDN'T WORK ON PAPER,

19:07.610 --> 19:09.601
BUT ULTIMATELY PROVES
TO BE REASONABLY SUCCESSFUL?

19:13.350 --> 19:15.341
- SO, HOW LONG THE TWO OF YOU
BEEN MEMBERS?

19:15.380 --> 19:16.574
- OH...

19:16.620 --> 19:18.178
- THIS HERE IS JUST
A TRIAL MEMBERSHIP.

19:18.220 --> 19:21.189
WE ONLY BELONG
TO THE MOST EXCLUSIVE CLUBS.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.812
- WELL, I HAD NO IDEA
PSYCHICS DID SO WELL.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.088
- MOST DON'T.
- SOME DO.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.358
- MANY TRY.
- FEW CAN.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.290
- I HAVE.
- SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE,

19:27.330 --> 19:29.150
EVERYONE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT
WARREN CLAYTON.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.327
- YEAH.
- YEAH, IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.134
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.489
COME ON.

19:35.540 --> 19:38.634
- HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST
HEDGE FUND MANAGERS AROUND.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.638
ONE OF THE ONLY GUYS SHOWING
A POSITIVE RETURN

19:40.680 --> 19:42.375
IN THIS RECESSION.

19:42.410 --> 19:45.140
WHICH IS WHY WE PUT UP WITH SOME
OF HIS MORE ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.704
- TO A POINT.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.241
[all laughing]

19:49.280 --> 19:52.249
- LET'S KEEP THINGS INTERESTING.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.257
$1,000 A HOLE?

19:53.290 --> 19:54.655
- SURE, WHY NOT.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.659
- WOW, YOU GUYS, UH,
BET LIKE THIS OFTEN?

19:57.690 --> 19:58.759
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:58.790 --> 20:02.453
SOMETIMES WE ACTUALLY PLAY
FOR HIGH STAKES.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.025
- I'M ACTUALLY GETTING
A READING

20:05.070 --> 20:07.026
ON BOTH OF YOU GENTLEMEN
RIGHT NOW.

20:07.070 --> 20:08.230
- HEH. SORRY, KID.

20:08.270 --> 20:09.498
I KNOW IT'S YOUR THING,

20:09.540 --> 20:11.167
BUT I DON'T GO
FOR THAT PSYCHIC MUMBO-JUMBO.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.030
- WHAT I'M SEEING IS THAT
SOMETIMES YOU PLAY

20:13.070 --> 20:15.504
FOR OBSCENELY HIGH STAKES.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.178
LIKE THE PRIVATE PLANE

20:17.210 --> 20:19.007
THAT WARREN CLAYTON CRASHED
AND DIED IN.

20:19.050 --> 20:20.449
- ALL RIGHT.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.777
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

20:21.820 --> 20:22.844
I LOST THE JET TO CLAYTON

20:22.880 --> 20:24.484
IN A SKINS MATCH
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.182
- NOW, THAT MUST HAVE MADE YOU
PRETTY MAD.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.380
- SURE.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.854
BUT BEFORE ANYBODY GOES
AND GETS THE WRONG IDEA,

20:30.890 --> 20:32.755
I WAS IN EUROPE
WHEN WARREN'S PLANE CRASHED.

20:32.790 --> 20:35.588
LIKE I TOLD THE COPS,
LAST TIME I SPOKE TO WARREN,

20:35.630 --> 20:36.949
HE WAS PLANNING
ON USING THE PLANE

20:37.000 --> 20:38.729
TO TRAVEL MORE
WITH HIS FAMILY.

20:38.770 --> 20:39.919
HE EVEN GOT A PRIVATE HANGAR

20:39.970 --> 20:41.665
DOWN AT THE AIRPORT
FOR THEM TO USE.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.730
- THAT MEANS EVERYONE
IN HIS FAMILY

20:48.780 --> 20:50.133
HAD ACCESS TO THAT PLANE.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.307
- MM-HMM.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.076
- THIS IS WHAT I FIGURE.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.941
I FIGURE SOMEONE
IN WARREN CLAYTON'S FAMILY

20:58.990 --> 21:00.514
GOT TO THAT PLANE
AND SABOTAGED IT

21:00.560 --> 21:01.879
BEFORE HE TOOK OFF.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.457
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GET
DOWN TO THAT PRIVATE HANGAR

21:04.490 --> 21:05.650
AND LOOK AROUND.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.226
LET'S GO.
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.296
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
CHECK IN WITH ABIGAIL FIRST?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.696
- WHY WOULD I CHECK IN?
I'M NOT ON PAROLE.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.061
- YOU TOLD HER YOU'D CALL.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.489
LOOK, YOU CAN'T BE
YOUR USUAL LACKADAISICAL SELF

21:15.540 --> 21:16.632
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.830
ABIGAIL IS THE KIND OF GIRL

21:17.870 --> 21:19.269
THAT NEEDS A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF EFFORT.

21:19.310 --> 21:22.074
"RELATIONSHIP SHAWN"
NEEDS TO STEP UP HIS GAME.

21:22.110 --> 21:25.648
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THERE IS NO "RELATIONSHIP SHAWN'l

21:25.680 --> 21:27.045
OR "BOYFRIEND SHAWN."

21:27.080 --> 21:29.139
THERE'S JUST REGULAR SHAWN
AND MALIBU SHAWN.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.340
YOU KNOW THAT.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.415
BESIDES, I WAS JUST
WITH HER THIS MORNING.

21:32.450 --> 21:33.656
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO CHECK IN ABOUT?

21:33.690 --> 21:34.816
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.054
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE.

21:36.090 --> 21:37.387
I'M TALKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.886
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THIS STUFF?

21:38.930 --> 21:40.488
- A PLAYER ALWAYS KNOWS, SHAWN.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.452
- PLEASE.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.621
MAN, HOLD ON.
- FINE.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.865
- [sighs]

21:51.910 --> 21:53.798
- SHAWN.
- HEY, ABS.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.330
- THIS IS A SURPRISE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21:55.380 --> 21:56.631
- NO, NOTHING--
NOTHING'S WRONG.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.875
I'M JUST, UH, I'M JUST
CALLING TO CHECK IN.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.640
- COFFEE'S READY.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.580
WAS THAT--
WAS THAT MY DAD'S VOICE?

22:03.620 --> 22:06.441
- I'M AT YOUR DAD'S.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.913
- I THOUGHT WE AGREED.
NO PRESSURE.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.723
- WELL, YES, I SAID
I WOULDN'T PRESSURE YOU.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.523
SO I SET IT UP MYSELF.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.449
AND IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.058
- WHAT DID HE DO?
DID HE FIRE A WEAPON?

22:17.100 --> 22:19.068
OR--TELL ME
HE DIDN'T BAIT A HOOK.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.397
- HE'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.533
- HEY ABIGAIL, YOU WANNA SEE
HOW FAR I CAN SPIT?

22:22.570 --> 22:23.764
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M COMING OVER.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.061
I'M COMING OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.338
- NO, NO, NO.
NO NEED.

22:26.370 --> 22:27.701
WE'RE--
WE'RE JUST WRAPPING UP.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.230
BUT WE'RE MAKING PLANS
FOR THE THREE OF US

22:29.280 --> 22:30.645
TO HAVE DINNER
SOMETIME SOON.

22:32.510 --> 22:35.149
- GREAT.
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.249
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T WAIT.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.919
I GOTTA GO.
BYE.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.019
MAN, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
TO CHECK IN SOONER?

22:42.060 --> 22:43.379
- PLEASE, SHAWN.

22:50.030 --> 22:51.497
- IF SOMEONE ASKS US
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE,

22:51.530 --> 22:52.690
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY?

22:52.730 --> 22:54.288
THIS IS AN AIRPORT, SHAWN.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.296
WE CAN'T SNIFF AROUND
THE WAY WE USUALLY DO.

22:56.340 --> 22:57.864
I DON'T WANT TO END UP
IN GUANTANAMO.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.901
- GUS, DON'T BE PRINCIPAL
AND INTEREST.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.430
I ALREADY HAVE
A BRILLIANT COVER PLAN.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.731
HELLO, SIR.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.247
WE ARE HERE
FOR OUR 2:00 APPOINTMENT.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.872
- IS ONE OF YOU GUYS GUS?

23:05.910 --> 23:07.741
- APPOINTMENT FOR WHAT?

23:07.780 --> 23:09.873
- IT'S A FLIGHT LESSON.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.184
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.710
- JUST GO WITH IT.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.557
DISTRACT HIM WHILE I TAKE
A SNIFF AROUND.

23:15.590 --> 23:16.989
- WHO MADE THE RULE
THAT I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

23:17.020 --> 23:18.157
THE DISTRACT ION?

23:18.190 --> 23:19.282
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

23:19.330 --> 23:20.422
- I'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.654
OOH.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.053
IT'S NOT THAT PEBBLE.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.590
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,
I'LL NEED YOU TO TEACH ME

23:24.630 --> 23:26.825
EVERYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED
ABOUT HOW A PLANE WORKS.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.337
DON'T WORRY.

23:28.370 --> 23:30.463
FLYING IS JUST LIKE
DRIVING A CAR.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.138
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.309
- YOU SEE THAT?
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

23:37.010 --> 23:38.443
- OKAY, I NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS WAIVER.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.516
HERE, HERE, HERE.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.370
HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE,
AND HERE.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.546
- SHAWN.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.979
- ALSO A COPY
OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE

23:46.020 --> 23:48.488
AND INSURANCE...

23:48.520 --> 23:50.408
- DUDE, THIS IS SWEET.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.597
I'LL MEET UP WITH YOU
AFTER YOU LAND.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.577
- I'M READY FOR MY LESSON NOW.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.042
- YOU ALREADY HAD IT, PAL.
WE JUST LANDED.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.184
- I'M READY FOR MY LESSON NOW.

24:53.290 --> 24:55.258
- [sighs]
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.383
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO REFUEL
A TWIN-ENGINE PLANE?

24:57.420 --> 24:58.751
- 20 MINUTES, HALF-HOUR.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.758
- THANKS.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.222
HEY, BUDDY.

25:02.260 --> 25:04.399
NOBODY HAD ACCESS
TO THE NEW PLANE BUT CLAYTON.

25:04.430 --> 25:06.295
AND HERE'S A NEW WRINKLE
IN THE CASE:

25:06.330 --> 25:09.493
GUESS WHICH DEAD BILLIONAIRE
TOOK A FOUR-HOUR STOP

25:09.540 --> 25:11.405
THAT WASN'T
IN THE OFFICIAL FLIGHT LOG?

25:11.440 --> 25:13.806
SO WHY WOULD CLAYTON
SPEND FOUR HOURS

25:13.840 --> 25:14.829
IN BAKERSFIELD?

25:14.880 --> 25:16.131
- I'M READY FOR MY LESSON NOW.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.499
- YEAH, YOU ARE.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.208
AND WHAT TIME
DID YOU PICK HIM UP?

25:27.120 --> 25:30.055
THANK YOU, WAYNE.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

25:30.090 --> 25:31.250
ALL RIGHT.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.155
AFTER CALLING EVERY SINGLE
CAR SERVICE

25:33.190 --> 25:34.350
IN BAKERSFIELD--
- TWO.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.958
- I FOUND THE ONE
THAT TOOK WARREN CLAYTON

25:36.000 --> 25:37.729
TO THE AIRPORT.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.021
- SO YOUR HUNCH WAS RIGHT.

25:39.070 --> 25:40.731
HE WENT SOMEPLACE ELSE
WHILE HE WAS THERE.

25:40.770 --> 25:42.738
- YEAH, YEAH.
GUS, NOTE TO SELF.

25:42.770 --> 25:45.409
REMEMBER 1600 JOSHUA LANE.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.759
- YOU CAN'T GIVE ME
YOUR NOTE TO SELF.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.277
IT'S A NOTE TO YOURSELF.

25:48.310 --> 25:49.504
- FAIR ENOUGH.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.371
AT THAT MOMENT,
SHAWN FOUND HIMSELF ALONE,

25:51.410 --> 25:53.617
UNABLE TO FACE
THE JOURNEY AHEAD.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.641
- YOU CAN'T DO YOUR OWN
OMNISCIENT NARRATION EITHER.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.683
- LET'S SEE WHAT'S AT
1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.312
- THAT'S THE MUNSTERS' HOUSE.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.715
IT WAS 1600 JOSHUA LANE.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.485
- THANKS, NOTE TO SELF.

26:05.690 --> 26:06.952
THANKS, JULES.

26:06.990 --> 26:08.196
SO JULIET TRACED THE ADDRESS

26:08.230 --> 26:10.824
TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL
WATCHDOG AGENCY.

26:10.870 --> 26:14.362
IT'S A NONPROFIT
RUN BY A MRS. THOMAS.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.928
- HOW'S THAT LEGISLATION
ON THE EMISSIONS CREDITS

26:17.970 --> 26:19.164
COMING ALONG?

26:19.210 --> 26:21.235
- WHY WOULD CLAYTON COME HERE?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.134
- MRS. THOMAS?

26:23.180 --> 26:24.306
- MAY I HELP YOU?

26:24.350 --> 26:25.374
- I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.373
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE,
JAZZ HANDS.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.888
DOES THE NAME WARREN CLAYTON
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

26:33.620 --> 26:34.882
- COME WITH ME.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.828
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

26:38.860 --> 26:40.282
SURROUNDING
MR. CLAYTON'S DEATH.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.025
WE BELIEVE
HE MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.766
- WOW, THAT'S KARMA FOR YOU.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.427
YOU GUYS BELIEVE IN KARMA,
DON'T YOU?

26:45.470 --> 26:46.391
- YES, WE DO.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.761
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
WE ARE KARMA CHAMELEONS.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.392
- WE COME AND GO.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.307
- MY PSYCHIC SENSORS
LED ME HERE.

26:52.340 --> 26:56.731
AND I AM GETTING TRACES
OF WARREN'S META-ESSENCE.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.248
HERE. THERE.

26:59.280 --> 27:03.068
AND, SOMEWHAT SHOCKINGLY,
RIGHT THERE.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.382
- WELL, THAT'S UNCANNY.

27:04.420 --> 27:07.753
IF ONLY YOU WERE AS ATTUNED
TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.882
- OH, SORRY.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.057
I-I ALWAYS FORGET
WHICH ONE IS MINE,

27:13.090 --> 27:14.193
SO I JUST OPEN A NEW ONE.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.528
PLUS, I LIKE
THE LITTLE CLICKY-CLACK SOUND

27:16.560 --> 27:18.994
IT MAKES WHEN YOU...

27:19.030 --> 27:20.861
OH, THAT ONE DIDN'T DO IT.
HOLD ON.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.664
- YES, WARREN DID
COME VISIT ME.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.928
WE TALKED BUSINESS FOR
A FEW HOURS, AND THEN HE LEFT.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.870
LATER I SAW ON THE NEWS
THAT HE WAS DEAD.

27:27.910 --> 27:28.934
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

27:30.310 --> 27:31.777
HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
THE ENVIRONMENTAL TYPE.

27:31.810 --> 27:32.845
- HE WASN'T.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.939
THIS COMPANY'S BEEN
AT ODDS WITH HIM

27:34.980 --> 27:37.448
EVER SINCE MY HUSBAND AND I
STARTED IT.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.584
- WHOA, HE MUST BE
SEVEN FEET TALL.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.588
- UH, THAT'S A MASAI TRIBESMAN.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.020
CHARLES IS STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.

27:44.060 --> 27:45.618
- SHAWN, YOU'RE WASTING PAPER.

27:45.660 --> 27:48.197
- SHH.
RAIN DANCE.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.596
- SERIOUSLY, DO YOU MIND?

27:50.630 --> 27:52.029
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT A MAN

27:52.070 --> 27:53.162
WITH A LARGE CARBON FOOTPRINT?

27:53.200 --> 27:54.531
- PLEASE IGNORE HIM.

27:54.570 --> 27:56.492
SO WHY DID MR. CLAYTON
COME SEE YOU?

27:56.540 --> 27:59.805
- HE WANTED MY ENDORSEMENT
IN A BUSINESS MOVE

27:59.840 --> 28:02.502
THAT, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I DIDN'T APPROVE OF.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.940
WHEN I REFUSED,
THINGS GOT PRETTY HEATED.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.175
BUT I'M USED TO CLAY'S TEMPER.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.474
- SO MANY MEMORIES OF CLAY.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.647
THAT'S WHAT I CALLED HIM.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.715
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.954
I'M, UH, I'M CHARLES.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.309
- AND I'M SHAWN SPENCER,
AND THIS IS--

28:16.360 --> 28:18.681
- CHARLES, DON'T FORGET
TO SCHEDULE THAT LUNCH

28:18.730 --> 28:21.028
WITH COUNCILMAN PRATH ER.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.095
- SURE THING.

28:24.230 --> 28:25.265
NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.165
- SAME HERE.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.139
- I THINK YOU SHOULD'VE STUCK
WITH THE MASAI GUY.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.637
- SHAWN.
- WHAT?

28:31.670 --> 28:33.831
THEY WOULD'VE HAD SWEET CARAMEL
BABIES WITH 30-INCH VERTICALS.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.098
- I'M SORRY. WE HAVE TO GO.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.349
- [sighs]

28:39.810 --> 28:42.278
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.115
HAPPY?

28:44.150 --> 28:45.686
- YOU CAN'T RECYCLE FOOD,
SHAWN.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.415
- HOW MANY RULES ARE THERE?

28:47.450 --> 28:48.849
- PRETTY MUCH JUST THAT ONE.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.029
- [sighs]

28:52.390 --> 28:54.494
HMM, NOW I KIND OF WANT
TO EAT IT.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.294
LET'S GO.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.730
DUDE, THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING SHE'S NOT TELLING US.

29:03.770 --> 29:05.328
- DID YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY
SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT

29:05.370 --> 29:06.632
WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME AROUND?

29:06.670 --> 29:08.729
- YEAH, PLUS SHE SLIPPED
AND CALLED WARREN "CLAY,"

29:08.780 --> 29:10.031
WHICH IS WHAT HIS WIFE
CALLED HIM.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.877
- SOUNDS LIKE MRS. THOMAS
IS MORE

29:11.910 --> 29:13.548
THAN JUST A BUSINESS
ACQUAINTANCE.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.309
- SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S
ANOTHER FILTHY MISTRESS.

29:15.350 --> 29:16.544
AND SHE FITS WARREN'S TYPE.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.184
SHE'S ALL HEADSTRONG,
HOT IN A...

29:18.220 --> 29:20.415
FEMALE D.A. OR DETECTIVE
ON LAW & ORDER SORT OF WAY.

29:20.450 --> 29:21.883
- LIKE MILENA GOVICH?
- YEAH, LIKE A--

29:21.920 --> 29:23.114
LIKE AN ANGIE HARMON.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.923
- LIKE MARISKA HARGITAY?
- EXACTLY.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.689
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE MEETING
GOT ALL HEATED.

29:26.730 --> 29:27.992
- IN FACT, BEFORE HE DIED,

29:28.030 --> 29:30.863
HE TRIED TO BE THE MAN
THAT I ONCE LOVED.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.265
- KATIE ERBE?

29:32.300 --> 29:33.961
- DUDE.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.060
I THINK WARREN WAS TRYING
TO RECONCILE WITH HIS WIFE.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.431
AND I BET MS. GREEN JEANS
IN THERE

29:38.470 --> 29:39.630
WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

29:39.670 --> 29:40.807
- SOUNDS LIKE MOTIVE.

29:40.840 --> 29:41.977
- WE GOTTA GET LASSIE ON THIS.

29:42.010 --> 29:43.978
- WE NEED TO GET OUT
OF THIS OFFICE.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.919
- TAKE YOUR TIME READING IT,
OKAY?

29:47.950 --> 29:49.838
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE...

29:49.880 --> 29:51.916
- [imitates gunfire]
- ARE THE POLICE STILL WASTING

29:51.950 --> 29:53.417
VALUABLE TIME
ON YOUR LITTLE THEORY

29:53.450 --> 29:54.610
THAT ONE OF US
IS A MURDERER?

29:54.660 --> 29:56.287
- UH, YES.
ABOUT THAT.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.551
I DID GET A FEW
OF MY PSYCHIC SIGNALS CROSSED.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.558
BUT WHAT IS NOT IMPORTANT,
MRS. CLAYTON,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.693
IS WHO ACCUSED WHO
OF "PARTRICIDE."

30:03.730 --> 30:04.992
- YOU MEAN PATRICIDE.

30:05.030 --> 30:06.463
- WHAT'S "PARTRICIDE"?
- KILLING A PARTRIDGE.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.297
- IT'S A VICTIMLESS CRIME.
- NO IT'S NOT, SHAWN.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.592
- WHO'S THE VICTIM?
- THE PARTRIDGE.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.029
- HERE'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT,
MRS. CLAYTON.

30:13.070 --> 30:14.469
I HAVE IDENTIFIED THE CULPRIT

30:14.510 --> 30:16.432
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S
UNTIMELY DEATH.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.731
YOUR FAMILY IS OFF THE HOOK.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.543
- FINALLY.
SO WHO IS IT?

30:19.580 --> 30:21.275
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS ATROCITY?

30:21.320 --> 30:25.916
- ANOTHER GOLD-DIGGING,
YET FAR LESS EXOTIC MISTRESS.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.986
- MR. SPENCER'S THEORY
WAS CONFIRMED

30:28.020 --> 30:29.157
WHEN WE FOUND OUT YOUR HUSBAND

30:29.190 --> 30:30.157
HAD RECENTLY MADE CHANGES
TO HIS WILL.

30:30.190 --> 30:31.828
all: WHAT?

30:31.860 --> 30:33.919
- UPON HIS DEATH,
THE BULK OF HIS ESTATE

30:33.960 --> 30:35.496
IS NOW GOING
TO THE GREAT GREEN HOPE.

30:35.530 --> 30:37.794
- PLUS FORENSICS CONFIRMED
THAT THE PLANE'S ALTIMETER

30:37.830 --> 30:39.889
WAS TAMPERED WITH, AND OUR
SUSPECT HAD HER PILOT'S LICENSE,

30:39.930 --> 30:42.364
WHICH MEANS SHE KNEW ENOUGH
TO SABOTAGE THE CONTROLS.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.389
IT'S ENOUGH FOR A WARRANT.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.898
- OH, THANK GOD.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.305
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.103
I'M GLAD MY INITIAL INSTINCT
ABOUT YOU

30:50.140 --> 30:52.279
WAS CORRECT, MR. SPENCER.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.647
- THERE'S OUR SUSPECT.
LET'S GO, O'HARA.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.977
STOP RIGHT THERE.
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.373
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

30:59.320 --> 31:01.208
- CAN'T BELIEVE SHE ACTUALLY
SHOWED UP AT THE WILL READING.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.318
- WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.624
- MY DAUGHTER?
- MY SISTER?

31:04.660 --> 31:06.685
- WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

31:06.730 --> 31:08.618
- NYNA THOMAS, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.719
- LET'S GO.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.318
- THAT'S MY DAUGHTER, NYNA.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.190
SHE'S NO LONGER WITH US.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.162
- NYNA?

31:24.710 --> 31:27.702
[dogs barking]

31:35.690 --> 31:38.227
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THINK
I WOULD KILL MY OWN FATHER.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.319
- IN MY DEFENSE,
I INITIALLY THOUGHT

31:40.360 --> 31:41.896
YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH HIM.

31:41.930 --> 31:44.899
HOW PUMPED ARE YOU
THAT I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT?

31:44.930 --> 31:46.818
BUT YOU CALLED HIM "CLAY"
INSTEAD OF "DAD"

31:46.870 --> 31:48.269
OR "FATHER."

31:48.300 --> 31:50.689
- I STOPPED CALLING HIM "DAD"
YEARS AGO

31:50.740 --> 31:52.401
WHEN I DENOUNCED
OUR WAY OF LIFE.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.169
- OKAY, THEN WHY WERE YOU
SO UNCOMFORTABLE

31:54.210 --> 31:55.507
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND CAME
INTO THE ROOM?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.940
- BECAUSE I TRY TO KEEP MY PAST
FROM INTERFERING

31:57.980 --> 31:59.299
WITH MY NEW LIFE WITH CHARLES.

32:00.810 --> 32:03.745
- THEN WE CAN ALL
AGREE THAT THIS IS
COMPLETELY YOUR FAULT.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.283
- WHEN WARREN CAME TO VISIT ME,

32:06.320 --> 32:08.083
TO TELL ME SOME STORY
ABOUT HOW HE'D CHANGED

32:08.120 --> 32:09.417
AND HE WANTED TO RECONCILE,

32:09.460 --> 32:10.950
I PROMPTLY TOLD HIM
TO KISS OFF

32:10.990 --> 32:13.129
AND KEEP HIS DIRTY MONEY.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.696
BUT NOW THAT HE'S DEAD,
I CAN'T HELP BUT WISH

32:14.730 --> 32:15.992
I'D GIVEN HIM A SECOND CHANCE.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.725
- LISTEN, NYNA'S A SAINT.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.819
AND THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T
MENTION THE MONEY AT FIRST.

32:19.870 --> 32:23.567
- WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU FAILED
TO MENTION, NYNA?

32:23.600 --> 32:26.660
- WELL, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
IMPORTANT AT THE TIME,

32:26.710 --> 32:31.044
BUT NOW I REALIZE
THAT IT MIGHT BE.

32:31.080 --> 32:34.117
I OVERHEARD MY DAD ARGUING
WITH ONE OF HIS GOLF BUDDIES.

32:34.150 --> 32:36.744
SOMETHING ABOUT A PROBLEM
WITH ONE OF HIS INVESTMENTS.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.940
- GOLF BUDDIES?

32:42.390 --> 32:44.221
- SO, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU BOYS?

32:44.260 --> 32:45.329
- MR. WISWALL,

32:45.360 --> 32:46.918
YOU TOLD US
THAT YOU HADN'T SPOKEN

32:46.960 --> 32:48.097
TO WARREN CLAYTON FOR MONTHS.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.291
THEN I HAD A VISION
OF AN ARGUMENT.

32:50.330 --> 32:53.925
SOMETHING ABOUT INVESTMENTS,
RETURNS.

32:53.970 --> 32:56.029
CAPITAL. . .GAINS.

32:56.070 --> 32:57.162
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?

32:57.200 --> 32:58.599
- YES.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.198
- WOW, NO FLIES ON YOU.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.504
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S ONLY
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

33:02.540 --> 33:03.575
YOU SEE, I'M ALSO SEEING--

33:03.610 --> 33:04.645
- WAIT, WAIT.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.999
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

33:06.050 --> 33:08.518
LET ME JUST
SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

33:08.550 --> 33:11.883
JUST BEFORE WARREN DIED,
I CALLED HIM, LIVID,

33:11.920 --> 33:13.808
ABOUT MONEY MISSING
FROM MY ACCOUNT.

33:13.850 --> 33:15.681
HE THEN CONFESSED TO ME

33:15.720 --> 33:17.654
THAT HIS BILLION-DOLLAR
HEDGE FUND

33:17.690 --> 33:19.055
WAS A GIANT PONZI SCHEME.

33:19.090 --> 33:20.182
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.356
I SIMPLY REFUSE TO BELIEVE

33:21.400 --> 33:22.697
THAT HENRY WINKLER HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.061
- WAIT A SECOND.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.159
IF THAT WERE THE CASE
AND THE S.E.C. EVER FOUND OUT,

33:26.200 --> 33:27.758
THAT WOULD MEAN CLAYTON
WOULD BE ON THE HOOK

33:27.800 --> 33:29.631
FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS.

33:29.670 --> 33:30.762
AND HIS INVESTORS
WOULD BE LEFT WITH NOTHING.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.869
INCLUDING YOURSELF.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.674
- HE'D ALREADY LOST
ALL MY MONEY.

33:34.710 --> 33:38.077
I HAD TO SELL MY HOUSE,
LIQUIDATE ALL MY ASSETS.

33:38.110 --> 33:40.374
CHRIST, I'M LIVING
IN A HOTEL.

33:40.410 --> 33:45.143
NO ONE KNOWS, BECAUSE I'VE JUST
BEEN KEEPING UP APPEARANCES

33:45.190 --> 33:46.441
AROUND THE CLUB.

33:46.490 --> 33:47.479
- PLEASE, CONTINUE.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.851
- I WAS DETERMINED

33:48.890 --> 33:50.585
TO GET MY MONEY BACK
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

33:50.620 --> 33:53.054
SO I CALLED CLAYTON
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

33:53.090 --> 33:56.127
I ASKED HIM TO AT LEAST
RETURN THE PLANE.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.691
THE BASTARD WOULDN'T EVEN
AGREE TO THAT.

34:00.730 --> 34:02.163
NOT EVEN WHEN I THREATENED

34:02.200 --> 34:03.792
TO MAKE AN ANONYMOUS TIP
TO THE S.E.C.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.661
- WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS
ALLEGED FONZIE SCHEME?

34:06.710 --> 34:08.905
- UH, NO ONE THAT I KNOW OF.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.249
I KEPT
ALL THE FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.542
BOXES FULL.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.002
JUST IN CASE I NEEDED PROOF.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.477
- I'M SENSING YOU WON'T HAVE
TO HOLD ONTO THEM

34:17.520 --> 34:18.680
FOR MUCH LONGER.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.921
- HEY.
SORRY I'M LATE.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.052
- NO PROBLEM.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.499
ABBY AND I WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT MY TIME

34:29.530 --> 34:31.521
AS A DETECTIVE.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.594
- I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED

34:32.630 --> 34:34.268
THAT YOU NEVER APPLIED
TO THE ACADEMY,

34:34.300 --> 34:36.393
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE
KIND OF DOING THE SAME THING.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.601
- YEAH, WE DON'T REALLY NEED
TO GET INTO THAT, DO WE, DAD?

34:38.640 --> 34:40.460
- I TRAINED HIM
TO BE A REAL DETECTIVE.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.899
HE WANTED TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL ASS-WIPE INSTEAD.

34:42.940 --> 34:46.000
- WELL, DAD, THE WIPE DOESN'T
FALL VERY FAR FROM THE ASS.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.039
TREE.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.217
AND IT USED TO BOTHER ME

34:48.250 --> 34:49.239
WHEN YOU SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.611
BUT NOT ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?

34:50.650 --> 34:53.039
BECAUSE I DISCOVERED
THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE

34:53.090 --> 34:54.318
OR WHAT FAMILY YOU COME FROM,

34:54.360 --> 34:57.056
FATHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN
RARELY SEE EYE TO EYE.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.887
- YOU KNOW, SHAWN, I THINK
THAT YOU AND YOUR FATHER

34:58.930 --> 35:00.921
WOULD COMMUNICATE BETTER
IF YOU--

35:00.960 --> 35:03.224
- TRAP-CAUGHT PRAWNS.
SOUNDS SAD.

35:03.260 --> 35:04.966
- RIGHT, NO FIXING.
- NO, NO, NO.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.128
I'D REALLY LOVE TO HEAR
ABBY'S PERSPECTIVE ON ALL THIS.

35:08.170 --> 35:11.298
- OKAY. SWEETH EART?

35:12.310 --> 35:13.334
- OKAY, SHAWN.

35:13.370 --> 35:15.031
I THINK YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE ABLE

35:15.080 --> 35:17.173
TO BETTER RESPECT
YOUR DECISIONS

35:17.210 --> 35:20.099
IF THE TWO OF YOU WERE ABLE
TO SHARE MORE OF YOUR EMOTIONS.

35:20.150 --> 35:22.038
- MM. YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT
REALLY THE SHARING TYPE.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.115
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

35:23.150 --> 35:24.549
- REALLY,
YOU'RE GONNA PRETEND

35:24.590 --> 35:25.887
LIKE YOU'VE HAD AN EMOTION

35:25.920 --> 35:27.842
SINCE WALKER, TEXAS RANGER
GOT CANCELED?

35:27.890 --> 35:29.812
- SHAWN, AT LEAST I'M WILLING
TO GIVE IT A TRY.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.088
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.985
TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.351
YOU'VE BEEN IN A HORRIBLE,
FIERY PLANE CRASH.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.152
YOU'RE CLINGING TO LIFE.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.963
ALL OF YOUR ORGANS
ON THE INSIDE--

35:39.000 --> 35:40.422
PFFT. PANCAKED.

35:40.470 --> 35:41.664
YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS TO LIVE.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.565
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU WANT
TO GET TO ME,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.363
YOUR ONLY SON,
BEFORE YOU DIE?

35:45.410 --> 35:47.833
- SHAWN, I'M NOT GONNA--
- GO.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.838
- I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER THAT.
- SEE WHAT I MEAN?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.677
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE HARSH
TO TALK ABOUT HIM

35:51.710 --> 35:53.507
BEING IN A HORRIBLE CRASH.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.517
- YOU SEE?
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

35:54.550 --> 35:56.472
- [sighs]
EXCUSE ME.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.442
- OH, PERFECT TIMING.

36:03.120 --> 36:06.749
TEXT FROM GUS.
MAJOR BREAK IN OUR CASE.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.327
- I HAVE TO GO.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.693
DEAR ABBY, DR. PHIL,
ENJOY.

36:12.730 --> 36:14.493
- DR. PHIL IS BALD.

36:16.270 --> 36:17.828
DOESN'T EVEN FIT.

36:17.870 --> 36:20.566
- YOU'RE NOT BALD, YOU'RE JUST
TALLER THAN YOUR HAIR.

36:25.610 --> 36:27.771
- GUSTER, YOU'D BETTER NOT
BE WASTING OUR TIME.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.017
- YEAH, THE CASE AGAINST NYNA
IS REALLY STRONG.

36:30.050 --> 36:32.780
- LASSITER, JULIET,
PREPARE YOURSELVES.

36:32.820 --> 36:34.856
I'M ABOUT TO BUST OPEN
A BRAND-NEW ANGLE ON THIS CASE,

36:34.890 --> 36:36.118
INCLUDING BRAND-NEW MOTIFS.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.219
- MOTIVES.
- LIKE FRAUD. EMBEZZLING-MENT.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.127
AND SUB-PRIME TIME
TOXIC ASSETS.

36:47.070 --> 36:50.392
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?
- YOU ARE A CHILD.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.442
- DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.846
- HE'S DEAD.

37:06.890 --> 37:09.688
- MAN, WHY DOES THIS
ALWAYS HAPPEN?

37:09.720 --> 37:10.755
- WE HAVE TO START CHECKING
FIRST.

37:10.790 --> 37:11.927
- YEAH.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.552
- POSSIBLE HOMICIDE
DOWN AT CARLYLE HOTEL.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.624
- WHAT'S A PROSPECTUS?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.626
- INVESTMENT RECORDS.

37:26.210 --> 37:28.064
THAT MUST BE
THE REGISTRATION NUMBER

37:28.110 --> 37:30.078
FOR WARREN CLAYTON'S HEDGE FUND.

37:30.110 --> 37:33.045
WHOEVER KILLED WISWALL MUST HAVE
TAKEN THE EVIDENCE WITH THEM.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.838
- GOOD NEWS.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.949
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE THEY'RE GOING NEXT.

37:42.090 --> 37:45.082
[funereal organ music]

37:49.100 --> 37:50.795
- THEY'RE PROBABLY ONLY HERE
FOR THE PHOTO OPS.

37:58.770 --> 38:01.034
IT'S TYPICAL.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.807
- DEARLY BELOVED...

38:05.850 --> 38:07.977
- I THINK MR. CLAYTON WOULD'VE
WANTED ME TO SPREAD HIS REMAINS.

38:08.010 --> 38:09.238
- OKAY, SHAWN, THAT'S ENOUGH.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.316
YOU ONLY SPOKE TO HIM
FOR, LIKE, 30 SECONDS.

38:11.350 --> 38:12.442
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.843
- WE WERE BEYOND NAMES.

38:13.890 --> 38:15.482
- IF ANYONE CLOSE
TO WARREN CLAYTON

38:15.520 --> 38:17.181
WOULD LIKE TO SAY
A FEW WORDS?

38:19.590 --> 38:21.319
- WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE--

38:21.360 --> 38:24.796
- WARREN CLAYTON
IS COMMUNICATING WITH ME.

38:24.830 --> 38:26.866
- TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF OF MY HUSBAND!

38:26.900 --> 38:28.936
- FROM IN HERE.

38:31.370 --> 38:35.636
DUST IN THE WIND.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.704
[guests gasping]

38:36.740 --> 38:41.109
- ALL WE ARE IS DUST IN...

38:43.820 --> 38:45.082
[blows out]

38:45.120 --> 38:46.348
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:49.620 --> 38:50.814
- YOU KILLED WARREN CLAYTON.

38:50.860 --> 38:53.055
[guests gasping]

38:53.090 --> 38:54.455
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- IS IT?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.127
MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.993
NYNA WANTED NOTHING TO DO
WITH HER FATHER'S MONEY.

38:59.030 --> 38:59.997
YOU DID.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.167
- I KNOW WHAT NYNA SAID.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.565
AND I'M BEGGING YOU
TO RECONSIDER.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.761
WE COULD DO SO MUCH
WITH THAT MONEY.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.835
- WARREN REFUSED TO RECONSIDER.

39:06.870 --> 39:09.134
HE WAS GONNA CHANGE HIS WILL
BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM

39:09.180 --> 39:10.829
WHEN HE RETURNED HOME
THE NEXT DAY.

39:10.880 --> 39:14.509
THAT IS PRECISELY WHEN YOU SET
YOUR DASTARDLY PLAN INTO EFFECT.

39:14.550 --> 39:16.313
LIKE YOUR WIFE,

39:16.350 --> 39:18.545
AND APPARENTLY EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS FAMILY,

39:18.590 --> 39:22.014
YOU HAVE EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE
OF AIRCRAFT-ERY.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.357
[winces]

39:23.390 --> 39:25.654
I CAN SEE THE ALTI-METER

39:25.690 --> 39:27.385
IN THE WRECKAGE
OF WARREN'S PLANE.

39:29.530 --> 39:30.519
ALTI-METER?

39:30.560 --> 39:31.492
- ALTIMETER.

39:31.530 --> 39:32.792
- ALTIMETER.

39:32.830 --> 39:36.960
AND THE ELEVATION IS OFF
BY 1,200 FEET.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.468
THIS MEANS
IT WAS TAMPERED WITH.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.205
[all gasping]

39:42.710 --> 39:44.746
YOU CAUSED THE CRASH.

39:44.780 --> 39:47.704
AND SO WARREN CLAYTON DIED,

39:47.750 --> 39:50.139
BEFORE HE COULD TAKE
YOUR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION

39:50.180 --> 39:51.738
OUT OF HIS WILL.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.041
AND YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN THE CLEAR.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.580
UNTIL...

39:54.620 --> 39:57.487
GARVI N.
- WHAT?

39:57.520 --> 39:58.726
- COME ON, DUDE.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.580
- YEAH, I GET IT.
IT WAS THAT GUY.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.029
- UNTIL YOU HEARD ABOUT

40:02.060 --> 40:04.051
WARREN'S ARGUMENT WITH
HIS GOLF BUDDY, CHAD WISWALL.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.989
KNOWING THAT WISWALL
WAS GOING TO BLOW THE WHISTLE

40:07.030 --> 40:08.588
ON THE PONZI SCHEME,

40:08.640 --> 40:11.063
THUS FREEZING
MR. CLAYTON'S ASSETS,

40:11.100 --> 40:13.330
YOU WENT AHEAD
AND CLUBBED HIM TOO.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.507
[all gasping]

40:14.540 --> 40:15.575
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

40:15.610 --> 40:17.669
NYNA, TELL HIM.

40:17.710 --> 40:21.009
- IS THAT WHY YOU DISAPPEARED
FOR HOURS AFTER MY FATHER LEFT?

40:21.050 --> 40:24.713
AND WHY YOU WERE
SHREDDING PAPER LAST NIGHT?

40:29.760 --> 40:32.354
- SWEETIE.

40:32.390 --> 40:35.097
YOU DESERVED THE MONEY.
WE DESERVED IT.

40:35.130 --> 40:37.257
WE COULD'VE DONE so MUCH GOOD--
- [slap]

40:37.300 --> 40:40.622
- OFFICER, HOLD THIS MAN
UNTIL DETECT IVES LASSITER

40:40.670 --> 40:42.297
AND O'HARA
ARRIVE ON THE SCENE.

40:42.340 --> 40:45.161
HERE, TAKE THIS.
MY WORK IS DONE.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.475
[clears throat]

40:48.510 --> 40:50.239
[polite applause]
- PLEASE.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.407
NO.
NO, NO, NO.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.576
NO NEED TO THANK ME.

40:53.610 --> 40:55.612
- THAT'S NOT FOR YOU.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.444
- THIS IS STILL A FUNERAL, SON.

41:00.490 --> 41:03.357
- OF COURSE.

41:03.390 --> 41:04.880
- GOOD JOB.
- THANKS.

41:04.930 --> 41:08.229
[coughs]

41:08.260 --> 41:10.125
I THINK I BREATHED IN
SOME DEAD GUY.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.460
- OH, HEY, SHAWN.
COME ON IN.

41:19.510 --> 41:20.932
HAVE A SEAT.
JUST WATCHING THE GAME.

41:20.970 --> 41:22.904
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

41:22.940 --> 41:24.202
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.879
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO APOLOGIZE
FOR MY BEHAVIOR.

41:26.910 --> 41:29.378
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE'VE
NEVER TRIED TO KILL EACH OTHER,

41:29.420 --> 41:31.217
I'M WILLING TO ADMIT
THAT OUR FAMILY

41:31.250 --> 41:32.786
IS NOT AS MESSED UP
AS I THOUGHT WE WERE.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.082
- ALL RIGHT,
VERY COOL.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.758
VERY COOL.
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.189
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.552
AND YOU KNOW, YOU ASKED ME
THAT QUESTION AT DINNER

41:39.590 --> 41:40.784
THE OTHER NIGHT,
THE ONE ABOUT

41:40.830 --> 41:42.422
IF I ONLY HAD 15 SECONDS
LEFT TO LIVE.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.052
WELL, I'VE GOT
AN ANSWER FOR YOU.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.022
- I'D WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT, UH--

41:46.070 --> 41:48.061
WELL, I'D DO MY BEST
TO EXPRESS--

41:48.100 --> 41:50.295
LOOK, WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW--

41:51.570 --> 41:54.607
WAIT, WAIT--
- THAT'S IT, POP.
YOU'RE DEAD.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.971
I'M CLOSING YOUR EYELIDS.

41:56.010 --> 41:57.034
I'M TAKING OFF YOUR WATCH,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.002
PUTTING THAT THING
ON CRAIGSLIST.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.272
- JUST WANTED TO SAY
I LOVE YOU.
