00:08.068 --> 00:10.758
[Narrator] Seven months ago,
the race of a lifetime began.

00:15.103 --> 00:17.793
[Rob] What have we
got ourselves into?

00:17.827 --> 00:20.172
[Narrator] F ive
pairs of ordinary brits

00:20.206 --> 00:23.586
embarked on a
25,000-kilometer journey...

00:23.620 --> 00:25.034
Let's go.

00:25.068 --> 00:29.965
[Narrator]... from Mexico
City to ushuaia, Argentina,

00:31.275 --> 00:33.172
the most southerly
city in the world.

00:34.586 --> 00:36.241
They battled extreme weather...

00:36.655 --> 00:38.172
Oh my god.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.275
[Narrator] ...Trekked
high into the andes...

00:40.310 --> 00:42.586
[Jamiul] If I can do this I
can do a hell of a lot more.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.275
[Narrator] Crossed
vast deserts...

00:44.310 --> 00:46.034
[Jen] I can't see
anything for miles.

00:46.068 --> 00:49.241
[Narrator] ...And navigated some
of the world's most volatile regions.

00:49.275 --> 00:53.413
- He's coming over with a gun.
- We need to evacuate asap, before the border closes.

00:53.448 --> 00:54.655
[Sam] Oh my god.

00:54.689 --> 00:56.103
What's next?

00:56.137 --> 00:59.172
[Narrator] All with budgets
stretched to breaking point.

00:59.206 --> 01:01.827
We do need to move fast,
but we need to move cheap.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.586
- [Michael] Hang on, where's my money belt?
- It's gone, babe.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.758
- Our race is over.
- You're joking.

01:06.793 --> 01:08.344
[Narrator] The rewards
have been great.

01:08.379 --> 01:11.379
That is the best view
I've ever seen in my life.

01:11.413 --> 01:14.206
I'd be absolutely gutted
if I knew I'd missed this.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.034
The way they live
their life is just heaven.

01:16.068 --> 01:19.206
- [All speak in foreign
language] - Oh, my god.

01:19.241 --> 01:21.655
[Narrator] And the first
team to the finish line...

01:21.689 --> 01:24.241
-[Emon] Let's go!
-[Narrator] Claim the prize...

01:24.275 --> 01:25.379
[Rob] We're here.

01:25.413 --> 01:28.965
- [Narrator] ...Of £20,000...
- [Jen] Our bus stop.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.620
[Narrator] ...In a
race across the world.

01:31.655 --> 01:34.689
- [Contestants groaning]
- Come on!

01:34.724 --> 01:37.241
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

01:46.724 --> 01:51.103
[Narrator] For the first time since
the race, all five teams are reuniting.

01:51.137 --> 01:52.793
[Jen] So excited
to see everybody.

01:52.827 --> 01:55.379
Yes, it's a race and you want
to win, you want to beat them.

01:55.413 --> 01:56.872
But they're the only
family you've got.

01:56.896 --> 01:59.068
It's gonna be surreal
meeting everyone again.

01:59.103 --> 02:01.137
[Narrator] Mother and
son, from Manchester,

02:01.172 --> 02:02.172
Jo and Sam.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.586
- [Jo] Hey, we made it.
- [Sam] Finally made it.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.310
That's an experience
that'll stay in my head for life.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.000
[Narrator] London couple
Michael and shuntelle.

02:10.034 --> 02:13.551
- This is the adventure that we were looking for.
- Not me.

02:13.586 --> 02:15.068
I weren't anywhere near ready.

02:15.103 --> 02:17.862
[Narrator] Siblings from
Yorkshire, dom and Lizzie.

02:17.896 --> 02:19.286
[Dom] I just remember
sitting on the edge

02:19.310 --> 02:22.862
and just thinking, "how
the hell did we get here?"

02:24.551 --> 02:25.827
[Jamiul] Race you to the top.

02:25.862 --> 02:29.241
[Narrator] Race winners, uncle
emon and his nephew jamiul.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.555
Made me think about my own life.

02:31.137 --> 02:32.551
That's the way family should be.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.137
We did start this as strangers.

02:34.172 --> 02:37.068
You know what? I think we've
made up for ten years' time.

02:37.103 --> 02:39.172
[Jen] Check in! Check in!

02:39.206 --> 02:41.896
[Narrator] And married couple
from reading, Jen and Rob.

02:41.931 --> 02:43.551
There were three
people in that race.

02:43.586 --> 02:44.931
Jen, Rob and checkpoint Jen.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.758
[Jen screams] I can't do it!

02:49.103 --> 02:51.620
[Narrator] It's a chance to
share in some euphoric highs...

02:54.655 --> 02:58.241
It's just like heaven
to me. It's just heaven.

02:58.275 --> 02:59.596
[Narrator] And
heartbreaking lows.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.551
I was gutted, I'm not
going to pretend I wasn't.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.172
[Narrator] Revelations emerge...

03:04.206 --> 03:07.206
I genuinely thought that
when the cameras went off

03:07.241 --> 03:09.103
we'd get like a
sandwich and a wine.

03:09.137 --> 03:10.862
[All laughing]

03:10.896 --> 03:12.941
[Narrator]... as they confess to what
they really thought when they first met...

03:12.965 --> 03:15.827
Well, I thought it was a good
combination of muscle and brains.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.862
[Narrator] ...And relive what
else happened at checkpoints.

03:18.896 --> 03:22.379
- You were voted chief.
- I was chieftain for the day.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.379
[Narrator] Rivalries
are re-examined...

03:25.413 --> 03:27.379
Your face was like,
"don't look at him."

03:27.413 --> 03:30.068
- It was awful.
- She can do it, so can I.

03:30.103 --> 03:31.275
There you go.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.620
[Narrator] ...As they
compare different strategies...

03:33.655 --> 03:36.103
You kept bringing up that
you were low on your budget

03:36.137 --> 03:39.034
and I had set in my mind
that you were just telling us that

03:39.068 --> 03:40.517
so we'd spend more money.

03:40.551 --> 03:43.965
[Narrator]... divulge the secrets
to winning race across the world.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.965
Turned out, actually, money
wasn't the key to winning.

03:47.793 --> 03:49.379
Hello!

03:49.413 --> 03:51.941
[Narrator] And we find out how life
has changed since returning home.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.965
- How you been?
- Flew in yesterday.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.931
- Where are you then?
- Austria.

03:55.965 --> 03:58.551
- Oh wow.
- I'm doing a ski season.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.517
Throughout the trip it
just became one big family.

04:01.551 --> 04:03.689
Oh, 'ey up!

04:03.724 --> 04:06.137
We share such a
unique experience.

04:07.344 --> 04:09.689
This is so nice to have
our family back together.

04:09.724 --> 04:12.793
- [Shuntelle] I know!
- [Jen] Is this a group hug moment?

04:16.655 --> 04:17.793
[Narrator] Mexico City.

04:19.448 --> 04:21.586
The team's assembled
at the start line.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.620
Wow. OMG.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.862
Just two days before, they departed
the UK with no idea of the starting point,

04:28.896 --> 04:31.413
the route, or their
ultimate destination.

04:31.448 --> 04:32.724
White trainers, dom.

04:32.758 --> 04:35.793
- I'm not sure about that.
- We'll do a nice "before and after."

04:35.827 --> 04:37.689
Oh! Oh!

04:37.724 --> 04:39.320
[Dom] We don't even
know where we're going.

04:39.344 --> 04:41.448
We don't even know where we are.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.586
So here it is.

04:43.620 --> 04:46.379
In Mexico, that's when we
realized how hard it will be.

04:46.413 --> 04:48.862
- The final destination is...
- Oh, my god.

04:48.896 --> 04:51.724
- "Ushu..." what?
- "Ushu..."

04:52.655 --> 04:55.862
- "Ushuaia?"
- who found ushuaia

04:55.896 --> 04:57.241
- on the map?
- I think it was me.

04:57.275 --> 04:58.379
Maybe flip the paper.

04:58.413 --> 05:00.896
We were like, "oh
god, it can't be that far."

05:00.931 --> 05:03.344
And I saw it at the very bottom.

05:03.379 --> 05:05.344
[Overlapping chatter]

05:07.379 --> 05:11.655
[Narrator] From Mexico
City to ushuaia, Argentina.

05:11.689 --> 05:15.137
Passing through 16 countries
and seven checkpoints.

05:15.172 --> 05:19.000
To get there they had
just over £1400 each,

05:19.034 --> 05:20.896
the price of the air fare.

05:20.931 --> 05:23.448
I don't think it's a
lot, really. That's food,

05:23.482 --> 05:26.862
travel and accommodation.
That's everything, innit?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.655
How you feeling?
You feeling energized?

05:29.689 --> 05:31.931
Just wanna get
out of the city now.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.965
[Jen] How we gonna get there?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.655
You look at things on a map and
think, "oh, it's only two thumbs."

05:36.689 --> 05:42.241
I just didn't realize the
scale. I've never traveled.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.482
[Dom] I definitely felt
under-prepared at the start line.

05:45.724 --> 05:48.206
I had no idea what
was about to happen.

05:48.241 --> 05:51.172
[Michael] I was in competition
mode straight away.

05:51.206 --> 05:53.068
I wasn't.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.896
[Narrator] It was the first
chance to size up the competition.

05:55.931 --> 05:57.551
[Michael] Some
fellow competitors.

05:57.586 --> 05:59.206
- Hi.
- I'm Lizzie.

05:59.241 --> 06:02.482
I think everyone was putting on
like a fake, "oh, hi, how are you?"

06:02.517 --> 06:05.172
But deep down, we were like
looking up and down like... "Hmm."

06:06.068 --> 06:07.827
[Narrator] Now the race is over,

06:07.862 --> 06:11.482
they can share what they really thought
when they first laid eyes on each other.

06:11.517 --> 06:15.275
I actually thought dom and Lizzie
were going to be our biggest competitors.

06:15.310 --> 06:16.941
I was like, "you know what?
They're gonna smash it out."

06:16.965 --> 06:20.482
I was quite intimidated by everyone
because we were the youngest combined pair.

06:20.517 --> 06:22.896
I mean, shuntelle kept
on referring to you as kids.

06:24.103 --> 06:26.517
"Bless 'em, I hope
they've got good clothes,

06:26.551 --> 06:29.482
hope they're gonna wrap up
properly, hope they're going to eat."

06:29.517 --> 06:31.034
- How you guys doing?
- Nervous.

06:31.068 --> 06:33.172
- A bit nervous. Excited.
- Yeah.

06:33.206 --> 06:35.551
Mike, game face. Knew
he'd be a competitor.

06:36.758 --> 06:38.724
He looked like a raging bull.

06:38.758 --> 06:40.172
[Mimics snorting with rage]

06:41.413 --> 06:42.793
He was geeing himself up.

06:42.827 --> 06:44.103
"We've got this. Come on."

06:44.137 --> 06:47.068
You know, I just thought,
"I don't got anything."

06:47.103 --> 06:49.655
[Jen and Rob cheering lightly]

06:49.689 --> 06:52.310
- I thought Jen was there for a holiday.
- [All] Ooh!

06:55.551 --> 06:57.137
He's got a shirt on!
What's going on?

06:57.172 --> 06:59.586
Seemed like he was coming
down for a job interview.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.137
I did laugh. I'm sorry, Robert.

07:01.172 --> 07:04.068
I did laugh. I was like,
"dom, he's wearing chinos."

07:04.103 --> 07:06.827
"Have they just
accidentally joined the line?"

07:06.862 --> 07:09.448
"It's not the queue
for the bus, guys."

07:09.482 --> 07:12.517
I think people just
thought "idiots."

07:12.551 --> 07:14.907
[Rob] I don't know. People
underestimate us a lot, don't they?

07:14.931 --> 07:17.034
- Ha! Well...
- Ha!

07:17.068 --> 07:18.517
- Yeah.
- Little did they know.

07:18.965 --> 07:20.068
Hello.

07:20.103 --> 07:22.344
When I saw your wheelie
case, I thought, "brilliant.

07:22.379 --> 07:24.206
She won't last. She'll be gone."

07:24.241 --> 07:28.275
It just takes a rocky path and, boom,
case is off the end of a mountain.

07:28.310 --> 07:31.482
Well, I thought it was a good
combination of muscle and brains.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.896
Then Sam stands next
to me and lets one off.

07:34.931 --> 07:37.206
I'm like, "nice to meet you."

07:37.241 --> 07:39.517
And that's how you knew
you were gonna be friends.

07:39.551 --> 07:42.034
This is it, eh? Let's
get going, guys.

07:42.068 --> 07:44.172
And I was just like, "these
two have overdressed."

07:47.793 --> 07:50.655
Seeing all the other
contestants there, it was daunting.

07:53.034 --> 07:56.172
I didn't smile too much at the
start, just to try keep a game face

07:56.206 --> 07:58.689
and make sure that
they were fearful of us.

08:01.793 --> 08:05.448
I was just looking straight
ahead. I could sniff the winning line.

08:07.137 --> 08:09.620
I was ready.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.655
"Get to the end." That was
the goal. "Get to the end."

08:14.000 --> 08:15.413
[Bell tolls]

08:15.448 --> 08:18.068
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:22.034 --> 08:23.724
You two were just
tearing off everywhere,

08:23.758 --> 08:26.793
and we just thought you'd wear
yourself out in about four days' time.

08:26.827 --> 08:29.517
It was more like four minutes.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.275
[Emon] We sort of
like set the agenda.

08:32.310 --> 08:34.482
We were gonna be quick.

08:34.517 --> 08:37.413
[Jamiul] Slow down.

08:37.448 --> 08:40.275
[Emon] We were completely
shattered after that.

08:40.310 --> 08:42.344
Maybe we shouldn't
have started off like that.

08:42.379 --> 08:44.379
Get out everything
that we don't need.

08:44.413 --> 08:47.655
I think I speak for all of us. We
didn't expect the race to be what it was,

08:47.689 --> 08:49.413
how hard it was,
how tough it was.

08:49.448 --> 08:51.551
Don't think anyone
will have been prepared.

08:51.586 --> 08:54.379
I genuinely thought that
when the cameras went off

08:54.413 --> 08:57.482
we'd get like a
sandwich and a wine.

08:57.517 --> 09:00.931
'Cause I just didn't think they'd
actually make us do those bad things.

09:03.137 --> 09:04.724
Left, left!

09:04.758 --> 09:08.172
[Narrator] Escaping Mexico City, the
largest Metropolis in North America,

09:09.241 --> 09:12.068
would be tough and
burn precious time.

09:12.103 --> 09:16.172
[Dom] God. I probably should
have gone to the toilet before starting.

09:20.689 --> 09:23.724
[Narrator] The first hurdle to
overcome became a constant one.

09:24.793 --> 09:26.896
Excuse me, do you speak English?

09:26.931 --> 09:28.620
The language.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.068
[Dom] Sorry. Do
you speak English?

09:31.206 --> 09:32.620
No.

09:32.655 --> 09:36.275
What's it called? Do
you know where that is?

09:36.310 --> 09:39.172
- [Michael] Bus e stación?
- [Shuntelle] No, we're going subway.

09:39.206 --> 09:41.517
[Sam] Been looking for
a bank for three hours.

09:41.551 --> 09:44.931
Opened the bumbag and
realized we already had pesos.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.068
[Sam] I feel like an idiot.

09:46.103 --> 09:48.079
I think we made an assumption
that everyone would have

09:48.103 --> 09:49.896
at least a little
bit of English.

09:49.931 --> 09:52.137
And, how wrong we were.

09:52.172 --> 09:54.724
[Mimics Mexican accent]
"How would I find..."

09:54.758 --> 09:57.034
Speaking English
in a weird voice,

09:57.068 --> 10:00.586
- hoping they'll understand.
- But it works, it works!

10:02.000 --> 10:05.103
[Narrator] Six weeks in
and things got even trickier.

10:05.137 --> 10:08.206
How do you say "how
long" in Portuguese?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.310
Just about learning Spanish.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.413
And now we're in
a different country.

10:12.448 --> 10:15.275
[Jen] I'm not happy
about the new language.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.034
I'm going to get
ever so confused.

10:17.068 --> 10:21.310
Portuguese. Is that...
I don't want to say it.

10:21.344 --> 10:23.758
- Where do they speak Portuguese?
- Portugal.

10:23.793 --> 10:26.206
I was gonna say that
but I felt too stupid.

10:26.241 --> 10:28.965
[Narrator] But for Jen and
Rob, the struggle to communicate

10:29.000 --> 10:30.793
was difficult from the start.

10:30.827 --> 10:34.000
I got so frustrated by my
inability to communicate.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.586
And actually what happened
is, I really kind of like

10:36.620 --> 10:40.379
went insular, didn't I?
I completely retracted

10:40.413 --> 10:42.793
and I dare not even
start conversations.

10:42.827 --> 10:44.241
What time do we leave?

10:47.275 --> 10:49.103
Oh, god, I don't
know what that is.

10:49.137 --> 10:51.620
- Whereas for Robbie...
- i found it the other way around.

10:51.655 --> 10:53.310
I wasn't concentrating
on the words.

10:53.344 --> 10:56.758
- I looked at body language.
- That's the same in the UK for him, anyway.

10:56.793 --> 11:01.517
I lost my hearing in
my left ear in childhood

11:01.551 --> 11:05.896
and then recently I lost
hearing in my good ear.

11:05.931 --> 11:11.034
In a weird way, having difficulties
hearing was a kind of advantage.

11:11.068 --> 11:14.275
You show us how to...
What you want doing.

11:14.310 --> 11:18.862
Boat for free, if we work?

11:18.896 --> 11:21.724
[Rob speaks Spanish]

11:21.758 --> 11:27.000
We're getting free board
and a free canoe ride.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.655
I think it was down to you that
we overcame the language thing

11:29.689 --> 11:31.489
- with your charades.
- We were both involved.

11:33.758 --> 11:35.758
You're really getting more
expressive. I love that.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.724
[Narrator] The checkpoints
may have been fixed,

11:42.758 --> 11:46.206
but each team embarked on
their own individual journey.

11:46.241 --> 11:48.655
We're quite high up.
I'm already out of breath.

11:51.896 --> 11:53.896
When we were younger
we were so close.

11:53.931 --> 11:55.448
But we've grown apart.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.034
I would say we're siblings,
not friends any more.

11:59.689 --> 12:02.551
There's no better way to
save our relationship than this.

12:02.586 --> 12:05.724
Right, dom, off you go. Run.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.148
[Lizzie] We didn't have a game
plan. Just said we're gonna wing it.

12:08.172 --> 12:11.379
We're gonna use our natural
charm and just see what happens?

12:11.413 --> 12:13.689
[Dom] Hola. Does
anyone like free shots?

12:13.724 --> 12:16.620
We were gonna sort of
blag our way into things

12:16.655 --> 12:18.620
and that didn't really get used.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.310
Free shots? No?

12:20.344 --> 12:22.034
[Lizzie] I really
don't wanna do this.

12:24.448 --> 12:26.827
I'm quite shy around
people I don't know.

12:26.862 --> 12:30.517
I think at the beginning of the
race, I lacked self confidence,

12:30.551 --> 12:33.655
and I didn't have much faith in my
ability to, you know, go off on my own.

12:33.689 --> 12:35.551
I think we should ask them.

12:35.586 --> 12:36.655
Go on, then.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.217
- Can you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

12:38.241 --> 12:40.103
But I'm not asking.

12:40.137 --> 12:43.517
[Lizzie] I feel like every younger
sibling could relate to how I felt.

12:43.551 --> 12:45.137
But no matter how old you are,

12:45.172 --> 12:48.034
you fall back into
that old routine of,

12:48.068 --> 12:51.000
"they're the older brother.
Follow what they do."

12:53.965 --> 12:55.413
[Narrator] But in Peru...

12:55.448 --> 12:57.838
- [Dom] Shall we book a ticket?
- [Lizzie] We need to get money first.

12:57.862 --> 13:00.931
[Narrator] ...A terrifying health scare
almost ended dom and Lizzie's race.

13:00.965 --> 13:03.379
[Lizzie] He's having a seizure!
Someone call an ambulance.

13:04.655 --> 13:07.551
[Narrator] And Lizzie had
no choice but to step up.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.034
It's really scary. Usually he'd
be the one looking after me,

13:10.068 --> 13:14.586
and now I feel like... I don't know
whether I can do the same for him.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.068
It wasn't just you were
doing more than me.

13:17.103 --> 13:18.655
You were having to do all of it.

13:18.689 --> 13:21.068
Yeah. I think that
massively helped.

13:21.103 --> 13:22.137
Definitely.

13:23.793 --> 13:26.827
We wanna go to angra dos reis.

13:26.862 --> 13:29.379
Oh, my god. That was...

13:29.413 --> 13:31.965
Quick. Well done.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.551
Towards the end of the race I
saw my own confidence growing.

13:34.586 --> 13:39.103
Me being forced into that situation, I
realized how capable Lizzie actually is.

13:39.137 --> 13:41.977
- And she was actually making better decisions than I was.
- That's true.

13:43.517 --> 13:45.724
[Narrator] The intensity of
the race forced the siblings

13:45.758 --> 13:50.034
to open up to each other for
the first time since childhood.

13:50.068 --> 13:52.137
I've always known
that Lizzie does care,

13:53.827 --> 13:58.344
but when the seizure
happened, it upset Lizzie so much,

13:58.379 --> 14:00.620
it sort of really hit
home. I was like,

14:00.655 --> 14:03.862
"she actually really
does care about me."

14:03.896 --> 14:05.793
I shouldn't be such
an idiot sometimes.

14:05.827 --> 14:08.251
I do feel that you don't want
me around. And that's how I felt.

14:08.275 --> 14:10.758
Ok, well, I will
try to change that.

14:10.793 --> 14:12.620
- Okay?
- Okay. Yes.

14:15.034 --> 14:17.724
I do love you. Okay?

14:17.758 --> 14:21.137
Now we understand each other.
I think we're more like friends...

14:21.172 --> 14:23.103
- Yeah.
- Rather than just siblings.

14:27.896 --> 14:29.896
[Dom] I don't think
I've ever seen anything

14:29.931 --> 14:32.586
as beautiful as
that in my entire life.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.448
It's just a completely
different relationship to before

14:35.482 --> 14:36.827
and we actually miss each other,

14:36.862 --> 14:40.344
which is something that I never
really did before, no offense.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.068
[Narrator] And by
the end of the race,

14:42.103 --> 14:45.448
dom and Lizzie's charm
offensive started to pay dividends.

14:45.482 --> 14:47.448
- [Lizzie] Cheers.
- Salud.

14:47.482 --> 14:49.896
- New friends, salud.
- New friends.

14:49.931 --> 14:54.034
- Homemade food's always the best.
- It is. Chicken and potatoes.

14:54.068 --> 14:56.344
[Narrator] A new-found
confidence helped them mix with

14:56.379 --> 14:59.000
Argentinean locals,
Thomas and Mariana.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.320
[Dom] Are you guys
going to posadas?

15:00.344 --> 15:01.655
- [Mariana] Sure.
- Perfect.

15:01.689 --> 15:04.862
We actually have a party
tonight so if you want to join us.

15:04.896 --> 15:07.034
Yeah, sure.

15:07.068 --> 15:10.379
Helping other people,
you can gain a lot from it.

15:10.413 --> 15:12.655
A lot of people
helped us all the time.

15:12.689 --> 15:19.551
I came home and I've taken a job as a
teaching assistant at a secondary school.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.517
Challenging sometimes, but
I've actually really enjoyed it.

15:22.551 --> 15:24.310
And I found it rewarding.

15:24.344 --> 15:26.241
Thank you for letting us come.

15:26.275 --> 15:27.758
[Speaking Spanish]

15:29.172 --> 15:30.896
One regret, I might have had.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.586
- The birthday girl was showing some interest.
- [Lizzie chuckling]

15:33.620 --> 15:36.689
And I just remember
thinking, "I need to go to bed."

15:36.724 --> 15:40.413
Now, I look back, I'm like, "dom, why
did you not just seize the moment?"

15:40.448 --> 15:42.310
You could have had
an argentinian girlfriend.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.137
[Jamiul] Checkpoint,
here we come.

15:55.172 --> 15:57.448
[Narrator] After racing
for days on end...

15:57.482 --> 15:59.793
Nearly there, mum.

15:59.827 --> 16:02.588
[Narrator]... the competition to
finish first at each checkpoint meant

16:02.620 --> 16:04.275
the final sprint was frantic...

16:04.310 --> 16:05.896
Dom, wait for me.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.655
We're finishing this together.

16:07.689 --> 16:09.827
[Narrator]... and often
adrenaline-fueled.

16:09.862 --> 16:12.310
Check-in! Check-in! Check-in!

16:13.275 --> 16:14.700
There were three
people in that race,

16:14.724 --> 16:16.655
Jen, Rob and checkpoint Jen.

16:16.689 --> 16:19.103
[Shouting in exasperation]

16:19.137 --> 16:20.872
- Couldn't cope with checkpoint Jen.
- You couldn't.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.310
She was way too stressed.

16:22.344 --> 16:24.562
[Rob] I'm going to ban you from
all decision-making at checkpoints.

16:24.586 --> 16:26.206
You're just too stressed.

16:26.241 --> 16:28.793
"Ban you." Ban you from my life.

16:28.827 --> 16:30.413
[Rob] Just chill.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.448
Oh, my god, we're nearly there.

16:32.482 --> 16:34.655
Little sprint. Last little push.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.241
[Jen speaking Spanish]

16:38.275 --> 16:39.275
Seventh checkpoint.

16:42.689 --> 16:45.482
[Narrator] But the brief comfort
and time-out from the race

16:45.517 --> 16:47.275
meant it was always
worth the effort.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.344
[Shuntelle] Made it.
Made it to Panama.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.413
When we got through those doors

16:54.448 --> 16:57.689
and we walked into
the most beautiful hotel.

16:57.724 --> 16:59.896
Compared to where we'd
been for the last week,

16:59.931 --> 17:01.931
it was just breathtaking.

17:04.724 --> 17:08.620
The feeling when you got to a
checkpoint and saw a bed was just...

17:10.758 --> 17:13.379
Like overwhelming, just want to
lie down and never move again.

17:13.413 --> 17:15.448
- Cheers, winner.
- Cheers, winner.

17:15.482 --> 17:16.517
Please, don't...

17:17.724 --> 17:20.310
[Narrator] The times spent
together at checkpoints

17:20.344 --> 17:22.551
soon took on added significance.

17:22.586 --> 17:24.931
I love these checkpoints as I
get to hang out with you guys.

17:24.965 --> 17:26.724
I genuinely enjoy your company.

17:28.241 --> 17:33.482
The checkpoints just helped
galvanize you to keep going on,

17:33.517 --> 17:35.413
and galvanize you
to kind of get to them.

17:35.448 --> 17:37.729
- That was our bonding moments.
- [Lizzie] Yeah, and share

17:37.758 --> 17:40.172
all the memories
of the legs together.

17:40.206 --> 17:42.137
- You know, it's kind of counseling.
- Yeah.

17:44.103 --> 17:47.413
[Emon] This is awesome.
I feel like a proper cowboy.

17:47.448 --> 17:49.206
I'll just follow you guys.

17:49.241 --> 17:50.517
[Jamiul laughing]

17:50.551 --> 17:52.872
Yes, it's a race. And you want
to win, you want to beat them,

17:52.896 --> 17:55.172
but they're the only
family you've got.

17:55.206 --> 17:56.758
Oh, my god.

17:56.793 --> 17:58.413
[Rob] Getting to
share your stories...

17:58.448 --> 18:00.517
They're the only people
that truly understand...

18:00.551 --> 18:02.103
What you're going
through, definitely.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.355
[Narrator] The group
grabbed the opportunity

18:06.379 --> 18:09.000
to immerse themselves
in local customs.

18:09.034 --> 18:10.206
[All greeting in Spanish]

18:11.241 --> 18:14.655
Lake titicaca, home
to the uros people,

18:14.689 --> 18:19.586
many of whom live permanently on
the lake's 120 manmade floating islands,

18:19.620 --> 18:22.206
each constructed
from living reeds.

18:22.241 --> 18:25.000
We went on floating islands
and you were voted chief.

18:25.034 --> 18:27.206
I was chieftain for
the day, wasn't I, yeah.

18:27.241 --> 18:29.068
Who we nominating as president?

18:29.103 --> 18:32.310
[Jen] It needs to be someone
semi-sensible, so dom, you're out.

18:32.344 --> 18:34.217
We'd have a lot of fun on the
island though, wouldn't we?

18:34.241 --> 18:37.275
I think if you want a party
island, I should be president.

18:37.310 --> 18:40.310
I don't think I'm worthy
of the title. Sorry, guys.

18:40.344 --> 18:43.206
- Oh, I'll take it then.
- Okay, Rob.

18:43.241 --> 18:45.310
- I'll look after you all.
- Oh, thank you.

18:45.344 --> 18:47.827
- Should we hold him up?
- Yeah, let's go.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.827
That was incredible.

18:51.862 --> 18:54.241
[Dom] It was just
such an alien lifestyle.

18:54.275 --> 18:58.000
They literally were
living on floating reeds.

18:58.034 --> 19:01.862
It was just a really eye
opening day for every team.

19:01.896 --> 19:05.000
- And to share that experience was just even better.
- Yeah.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.103
I'm loving it.

19:08.137 --> 19:11.551
[Narrator] These fleeting checkpoint
moments created strong bonds.

19:13.758 --> 19:16.379
Honestly, I did not expect
this going into the race,

19:16.413 --> 19:18.620
but the bond we formed
with the other teams.

19:18.655 --> 19:21.551
Oh god, like we talk every day.

19:21.586 --> 19:23.413
So, you've been
busy recently, mate?

19:23.448 --> 19:27.517
Yeah, it has been a bit busy to
be honest. Yourself? How's life?

19:27.551 --> 19:29.286
That's one of the best
things to come out of this race.

19:29.310 --> 19:32.551
- Definitely.
- It's that family of people we have now.

19:32.586 --> 19:36.000
[Everyone singing] ♪
happy birthday, dear Jo ♪

19:36.862 --> 19:39.758
♪ happy birthday to you ♪

19:44.068 --> 19:48.068
You're not getting any.
This is getting us to ushuaia.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.000
Para llevar. Take away.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.000
[Jo] Are you nervous?

19:58.034 --> 20:00.137
I am, but don't
want to admit it.

20:00.172 --> 20:01.655
[Jo] We'll be fine.

20:03.413 --> 20:05.000
[Narrator] For Jo and Sam,

20:05.034 --> 20:07.862
the chance to complete the
challenge of a lifetime together.

20:07.896 --> 20:09.931
It's the perfect time
to go traveling now

20:09.965 --> 20:12.482
because my mum's getting
to the age where she's too old.

20:13.137 --> 20:14.000
Thanks.

20:14.034 --> 20:15.724
[Jo] So glad I brought you.

20:15.758 --> 20:19.517
Probably I don't have many
backpacking years left in me.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.586
Thanks, love.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.655
I know he's always
wanted to travel,

20:22.689 --> 20:26.482
and I thought it would be really
good fun to watch Sam see the world

20:26.517 --> 20:29.103
and hopefully give you the
confidence and enable you to...

20:29.137 --> 20:30.931
Go on my own and do it myself.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.769
- Well, hopefully that's what we get out of it.
- Yeah.

20:32.793 --> 20:33.793
[Man speaking Spanish]

20:35.482 --> 20:40.206
Okay, so, go and spread that
around and pick up the eggs.

20:40.241 --> 20:41.482
[Narrator] For mother and son...

20:41.517 --> 20:43.103
How do you understand all that?

20:43.137 --> 20:45.068
- I didn't, I'm guessing.
- [Sam laughs]

20:45.103 --> 20:47.620
[Narrator]... a little
Spanish went a long way.

20:47.655 --> 20:51.413
I'm glad I've got her here. If I didn't
have her here then I'd be screwed.

20:52.862 --> 20:53.896
Think it's here, mum.

20:55.344 --> 20:58.379
[Narrator] Chatting with
locals led to an early advantage.

20:58.413 --> 21:01.068
- Name, date and signature, please.
- Oh, my god, we're first.

21:01.103 --> 21:05.862
I think the key strength was my
mum speaking a little bit of Spanish.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.896
This is the most
uncomfortable seat.

21:08.931 --> 21:12.034
[Narrator] But the grueling
reality of back-to-back buses...

21:12.068 --> 21:14.413
[Sam] I've got a limit on
how much heat I can take.

21:14.448 --> 21:16.551
Just too hot to compute in this.

21:16.586 --> 21:18.620
[Narrator] saw Sam struggle.

21:18.655 --> 21:21.689
Do you think it's got
anything to do with your adhd?

21:23.103 --> 21:24.448
It probably does.

21:24.482 --> 21:27.551
I don't know. I've never been
able to explain why I'm anything.

21:29.517 --> 21:32.137
[Sam] Just sat there,
driving for hours.

21:32.172 --> 21:36.724
I wanted to stick toothpicks in my toenails
and kick a wall like, it's horrible.

21:36.758 --> 21:38.965
During the long
drives and stuff,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.586
I hated that, but I
knew it was all worth it.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.344
'Cause at the end
of that bus journey,

21:44.379 --> 21:45.859
there's going to be
something amazing.

21:46.344 --> 21:47.344
Whee!

21:50.758 --> 21:54.206
It's just like heaven
to me. It's just heaven.

21:54.241 --> 21:58.275
The salt flats were
absolutely stunning.

22:01.655 --> 22:05.241
That was a real moment when
we really felt the point of it all.

22:05.275 --> 22:07.482
You just got such a
feeling of insignificance.

22:07.517 --> 22:08.517
You did.

22:08.965 --> 22:10.137
[Farts]

22:13.275 --> 22:16.172
[Narrator] And in the
mountains of northern Argentina,

22:16.206 --> 22:17.931
Sam found his spiritual home.

22:19.206 --> 22:20.172
That is really cool.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.068
Like I never thought
I'd ever be doing this.

22:23.793 --> 22:25.217
- [Sam] Hector on the farm...
- [Jo] Yeah.

22:25.241 --> 22:26.801
I didn't understand
anything he said,

22:26.827 --> 22:29.310
but I still knew
everything he meant,

22:29.344 --> 22:32.517
because of the way he works,
and that's what I sort of do,

22:32.551 --> 22:33.655
so we got on really well.

22:33.689 --> 22:35.724
[All] Gracias!

22:37.448 --> 22:41.068
This is beyond what my
expectations were, and...

22:41.103 --> 22:44.241
At the end, I can absolutely say

22:44.275 --> 22:47.517
you were communicating
with everybody.

22:47.551 --> 22:52.034
You made real bonds
with people that we met.

22:52.068 --> 22:53.482
[Indistinct chatter]

22:53.517 --> 22:55.758
- [Man] Muchas gracias.
- [Sam] Muchas gracias.

22:55.793 --> 22:58.620
You had a great
time there, didn't you?

22:58.655 --> 23:00.103
It was a very sp...
Don't look at me

23:00.137 --> 23:01.517
like I'm gonna cry again.

23:01.551 --> 23:03.482
[Jo] Oh!

23:03.517 --> 23:06.965
I know, you're crying.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.586
- No.
- [Jo chuckles]

23:08.620 --> 23:09.551
[Narrator] As mother and son

23:09.586 --> 23:11.586
enjoyed experience
after experience...

23:11.620 --> 23:13.586
Ciao!

23:13.620 --> 23:17.000
The race began to take on a
whole new dimension for Jo.

23:17.034 --> 23:20.379
One of my main
motivations to go travelling,

23:20.413 --> 23:24.620
particularly with Sam was,
I've got a few health issues,

23:24.655 --> 23:28.000
and so I was
aware that I probably

23:28.034 --> 23:30.931
didn't have that many
more opportunities

23:30.965 --> 23:33.310
that I could do something
like this with Sam.

23:39.068 --> 23:40.344
I think, I don't know,

23:40.379 --> 23:43.137
some of you know
that if I've got lymphoma

23:43.172 --> 23:46.000
and I had chemo
about four years ago,

23:46.034 --> 23:49.793
and I knew it would come
back, but I didn't know when,

23:49.827 --> 23:52.655
and then when I was on
the trip, I kind of thought,

23:52.689 --> 23:55.000
"mmm, I think that
there's some signs,"

23:55.034 --> 23:56.413
and it has come back,

23:56.448 --> 23:59.000
so I'm actually now
on chemotherapy.

24:03.310 --> 24:04.827
Well, you know what?

24:04.862 --> 24:06.551
We know you, Jo,
you're a strong person.

24:06.586 --> 24:08.389
- [Woman] Yeah.
- And if anyone can fight it, you can.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.217
- Yeah, thank you.
- So, do you know what I mean?

24:10.241 --> 24:13.000
That wasn't easy, you know,
even doing the journey itself,

24:13.034 --> 24:14.379
and then knowing what you knew.

24:14.413 --> 24:15.655
Had all this going on,

24:15.689 --> 24:17.034
yet you still was like...

24:17.068 --> 24:18.620
You're here for all of us.

24:20.862 --> 24:25.034
But despite the relapse,
what the trip has made

24:25.068 --> 24:29.586
me think of, is to basically
take every opportunity I can.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.793
[Narrator] As the realities
of their dwindling budget

24:31.827 --> 24:33.000
began to hit home...

24:33.034 --> 24:35.689
[Jo] We need to get at
least one job on this leg.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.551
We just don't have enough
money to complete the race.

24:38.586 --> 24:40.724
Sam made sure his mum

24:40.758 --> 24:42.448
got to fulfill a lifelong dream.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.344
[Jo] Whoo!

24:43.379 --> 24:44.539
[Man speaking other language]

24:45.793 --> 24:49.241
Definitely, it's gives me
the bug to do more travelling.

24:49.275 --> 24:51.724
- Yeah.
- So I just have to get this chemo over with,

24:51.758 --> 24:53.551
and go again before
it comes back again.

24:53.586 --> 24:55.000
[Laughter]

24:55.034 --> 24:57.206
- [Shuntelle] I love your attitude, amazing.
- Yeah.

24:57.241 --> 24:58.448
[Jo] I wanted to be out there,

24:58.482 --> 25:01.689
um, living life and
seeing the world,

25:01.724 --> 25:05.034
whether it was us together,
or whether it was, you know...

25:05.068 --> 25:06.827
- With your boy?
- I'd ditch you.

25:06.862 --> 25:08.620
[All chuckling]

25:10.000 --> 25:11.551
Balls hurt so much.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.310
This is what we signed up for.

25:15.344 --> 25:17.310
I'm so glad I'm doing
this with you, love.

25:17.344 --> 25:19.224
Couldn't do it with
anyone better, to be honest.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.724
- [Cattle mooing]
- [Dogs barking]

25:31.689 --> 25:33.241
- [Lizzie] I'm so hungry.
- [Dom] Mmm.

25:33.275 --> 25:35.655
- [Lizzie] I'm starving.
- [Dom] Need some food.

25:35.689 --> 25:39.000
Oh, that's what you call
a barbecue. Look at that.

25:39.034 --> 25:40.379
[Narrator] Throughout the race,

25:40.413 --> 25:42.896
heads were turned by
the smells and tastes

25:42.931 --> 25:44.586
of Latin American cuisine.

25:44.620 --> 25:46.000
It's spicy, that.

25:46.034 --> 25:47.931
- Oh, that's good.
- Ha-ha!

25:47.965 --> 25:48.965
[Narrator] Some good...

25:50.551 --> 25:52.344
This is muy bien.

25:52.379 --> 25:54.586
- The bribri tribe in Costa Rica.
- Oh.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.551
[Dom] Well, they
slow cook this chicken

25:56.586 --> 25:58.413
on a wood fire.

25:59.241 --> 26:00.389
[Woman] This is indigenous food.

26:00.413 --> 26:01.424
- [Dom] Ah, okay.
- [Lizzie] Yeah.

26:01.448 --> 26:03.586
That's really tasty.

26:03.620 --> 26:06.379
I swear to god, it was
the nicest bit of chicken

26:06.413 --> 26:07.689
I've ever had in my life.

26:07.724 --> 26:09.079
- [Jen] Good god!
- [Narrator] And some,

26:09.103 --> 26:10.655
a more acquired taste.

26:10.689 --> 26:13.000
[Jen] Spatchcock Guinea pig.

26:13.034 --> 26:15.000
My favorite pet.

26:15.034 --> 26:17.344
[Rob] They just
present it so badly.

26:17.379 --> 26:18.931
Ugh, it's face.

26:18.965 --> 26:21.275
They fried its face. Ugh!

26:21.310 --> 26:23.310
And its claws were still there.

26:23.344 --> 26:24.310
[Crunching]

26:24.344 --> 26:25.931
Oh, god.

26:25.965 --> 26:29.103
He ate the hottest
chili in all of the market.

26:29.137 --> 26:30.965
I want one of these chilies.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Everyone's looking at me.

26:32.551 --> 26:33.724
It is hot?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.137
[Jo laughing]

26:35.172 --> 26:36.862
You need a fire extinguisher.

26:37.482 --> 26:39.413
Go on, go for it.

26:40.793 --> 26:42.448
- Is it really hot?
- Right, that's hot.

26:43.793 --> 26:44.620
Oh, my god.

26:44.655 --> 26:45.862
[Laughter]

26:45.896 --> 26:47.896
Whoo!

26:47.931 --> 26:50.241
He was just running
around trying to find water.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.482
Drink.

26:52.482 --> 26:53.827
Hot.

26:56.827 --> 26:59.896
Going for a slow releasing
porridge for breakfast.

26:59.931 --> 27:01.758
[Narrator] But with
continued money worries...

27:01.793 --> 27:03.689
Keep me going all day now.

27:03.724 --> 27:06.379
Honestly, I think most of our
conversations were about food.

27:06.413 --> 27:09.068
[Narrator] ...Food fast
became an obsession.

27:09.103 --> 27:11.344
I started seeing food where
there actually wasn't food.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.275
[Laughter]

27:12.310 --> 27:14.517
I'd look at a rock
and be like, "mmm."

27:15.034 --> 27:16.413
Who's a good boy?

27:17.137 --> 27:18.724
You'd be tasty on a plate.

27:19.965 --> 27:20.896
[Drilling]

27:20.931 --> 27:23.344
[Jen] This is a romantic,
quiet picnic spot.

27:23.379 --> 27:24.689
[Drilling continues]

27:24.724 --> 27:26.724
We'd have a bread
roll and we'd half it,

27:26.758 --> 27:30.034
and we'd buy a tin of
fake tuna, and we'd half it,

27:30.068 --> 27:32.482
- and we'd half a tuna sandwich.
- Fake tuna? [Laughs]

27:32.517 --> 27:35.000
And that was a good...
That was a treat meal.

27:35.034 --> 27:36.793
[Sam] Can I get a
packet of cheetos?

27:36.827 --> 27:38.347
- [Woman speaks indistinctly]
- Si, si.

27:39.344 --> 27:41.827
Like, no-one can't
know about cheetos.

27:41.862 --> 27:44.620
They're in every
country, everywhere.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.758
But, Michael, you
ran off a moving bus

27:48.793 --> 27:51.034
to run into a shop to buy
cheetos and come back.

27:51.068 --> 27:51.896
I was starving, mate.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.517
[Laughter]

27:54.689 --> 27:55.872
[Narrator] Fueling their journey

27:55.896 --> 27:58.551
even more than food
was the one constant

27:58.586 --> 28:00.724
all the teams soon discovered.

28:00.758 --> 28:02.586
[All greeting indistinctly]

28:02.620 --> 28:04.931
[Narrator] The
kindness of strangers.

28:04.965 --> 28:06.896
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thank you very much.

28:06.931 --> 28:07.976
- Cheers.
- [Jen] Thank you so much.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.413
Thank you very
much for hosting us.

28:09.448 --> 28:10.724
Thank you so much for this.

28:10.758 --> 28:12.793
I'm happy to help you.

28:12.827 --> 28:15.241
One of the most
fulfilling things in the race

28:15.275 --> 28:19.379
was the people we met and
the generosity that came our way.

28:19.413 --> 28:24.448
I like to invite to my
house, for dinner, tonight.

28:24.482 --> 28:27.655
Sometimes just looking at our
faces, how desperate we were.

28:27.689 --> 28:30.482
We didn't even need to say
anything. They were like, "come in."

28:30.517 --> 28:31.896
- Yeah.
- "Feed them."

28:32.758 --> 28:36.068
- Salud.
- To new friends.

28:36.103 --> 28:38.172
Those moments are
the ones I'll never forget.

28:38.206 --> 28:40.596
You can tell they didn't have
much, but they're still willing to give.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.758
We found so many
people fed us for free.

28:46.241 --> 28:49.413
This is so different to what
I'd imagined we'd be doing.

28:49.448 --> 28:51.896
[Narrator] In the coastal
town of huanchako in Peru,

28:51.931 --> 28:55.793
emon and jamiul found work with
local fishermen John and Santos.

28:55.827 --> 28:59.310
Welcome to this
family in huanchako.

28:59.344 --> 29:02.586
[Narrator] And later bonded
over a home-prepared meal.

29:02.620 --> 29:05.310
- Beautiful.
- Now we go to prepare the ceviche.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.965
Okay.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.379
Experiencing family life with John and
Santos made me think about my own life.

29:12.413 --> 29:16.000
- Bon appetit.
- That is good, man.

29:16.034 --> 29:18.010
For me, this is one of the
best experiences I've had

29:18.034 --> 29:21.482
because I got to meet you and
your dad. It's the way family should be.

29:21.517 --> 29:25.655
When I have children, I'll tell them
John and Santos looked after me.

29:25.689 --> 29:29.793
I want to start my own family
and, you know, moving forward.

29:29.827 --> 29:31.251
I mean, he gave you
a few tips, didn't he?

29:31.275 --> 29:33.137
Yeah.

29:33.172 --> 29:36.689
The fresh fish have
a lot of phosphorus.

29:36.724 --> 29:37.931
Okay.

29:37.965 --> 29:41.034
And then you have a lot of
energy, you know, with a girl?

29:41.068 --> 29:44.379
- Ceviche gives you, er...
- Gives you that...

29:44.413 --> 29:46.310
- that oomph.
- That oomph!

29:46.344 --> 29:49.068
And the parents of
my father. Eighteen...

29:49.103 --> 29:51.448
- Eighteen kids?
- Eighteen kids.

29:51.482 --> 29:56.379
And he was quite direct,
shall we say? Quite animated.

29:56.413 --> 29:59.275
Because it's too much
energy, you know, for your body.

29:59.310 --> 30:01.172
[Emon] "All right,
John. We get your drift."

30:01.206 --> 30:02.448
Yes.

30:02.482 --> 30:07.034
So, yeah, we found that a
bit amusing and a bit daunting.

30:07.068 --> 30:10.413
I really struggled with people
helping in the first instance,

30:10.448 --> 30:12.862
because I was thinking,
you know, what the hell

30:12.896 --> 30:14.416
are they going to
want in return of me?

30:14.448 --> 30:16.965
Or what have they just
taken? That hindered my ability

30:17.000 --> 30:20.344
to involve myself with communities,
even with them kids on the island.

30:24.206 --> 30:26.724
- Hiya.
- Hey, all right?

30:26.758 --> 30:28.827
[Jen] Oh my god.
Robbie, I'm so scared.

30:30.344 --> 30:32.551
People aren't nice
like this in england.

30:33.551 --> 30:34.896
You were always asking me,

30:34.931 --> 30:37.251
"oh, how do you know they're
gonna take us to the right place?

30:37.275 --> 30:38.665
How do you know
they're telling the truth?

30:38.689 --> 30:41.344
How do you know we're going in
the right direction following them?"

30:41.379 --> 30:42.758
You don't.

30:42.793 --> 30:44.965
Do you know how
much a taxi would cost?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.482
I was thinking to take
you in my car. [Laughs]

30:47.517 --> 30:49.655
- Really?
- [Jen] How much would you charge us?

30:49.689 --> 30:52.206
Uh, no, just for fun.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.448
- No. Really?
- Just for fun?

30:53.482 --> 30:54.838
- [Jen] Would you do that?
- [Man] Yes.

30:54.862 --> 30:57.103
It restored my faith in humanity

30:57.137 --> 31:00.965
and made me realize that
actually 99.99% of people

31:01.000 --> 31:04.241
actually are friendly and
good people and want to help.

31:04.275 --> 31:08.379
And that was like when I really started
to embrace it and really enjoy myself.

31:14.827 --> 31:16.896
- [Michael] Smash this here.
- [Shuntelle] Got to.

31:18.034 --> 31:19.310
[Narrator] Michael and shuntelle

31:19.344 --> 31:22.655
approach travel with
contrasting attitudes.

31:22.689 --> 31:25.241
[Shuntelle] I work for a large
international accountancy firm,

31:25.275 --> 31:28.724
but Michael is ex-army,
loves a challenge.

31:28.758 --> 31:30.758
I think if he could sleep
outdoors, he would.

31:30.793 --> 31:33.517
I hope that we're able
to work with each other

31:33.551 --> 31:34.931
rather than against each other.

31:34.965 --> 31:36.275
[Michael] This
is just fantastic.

31:36.310 --> 31:39.310
I don't need a luxury five
star hotel to enjoy something.

31:39.344 --> 31:42.827
This is the experience, the
adventure that we were looking for.

31:42.862 --> 31:44.241
Oh, my goodness,
the four seasons.

31:44.275 --> 31:45.620
[Sighs]

31:45.655 --> 31:47.275
That's where I want to go.

31:47.310 --> 31:51.068
When we started this race, we
did say this was a make or break.

31:51.103 --> 31:53.620
I was a duck out of water.

31:53.655 --> 31:56.482
I'm very tired. And now
we begin our epic journey.

31:56.517 --> 31:58.206
Twenty odd hours on a coach.

31:58.241 --> 32:00.275
He was lapping it up.

32:00.310 --> 32:03.000
I'd rather do this than go to
Barbados or Jamaica right now.

32:03.034 --> 32:05.827
[Shuntelle] Totally
out of my comfort zone.

32:05.862 --> 32:09.344
The long bus journeys, the
horrible toilets, the horrible hostels.

32:09.379 --> 32:12.620
It was just constant. It
was so much. [Laughing]

32:12.655 --> 32:15.241
It was just trying to get
from one day to the next.

32:15.275 --> 32:17.068
Trying to understand
the languages,

32:17.103 --> 32:18.320
trying to understand each other.

32:18.344 --> 32:19.931
Week one, that's
all I was doing.

32:21.413 --> 32:24.310
I was just taking in all
the sights, all the views,

32:24.344 --> 32:26.275
and the madness of it all.

32:26.310 --> 32:29.931
I didn't feel in control, which I
struggle with, so I kind of froze.

32:29.965 --> 32:32.517
It really was traumatic,
that first week, for me.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.137
[Crying] Do I look like someone
who slept outside in my life?

32:35.172 --> 32:37.620
No, but this is... This is
about opening up your mind.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.620
[Michael] There was a definite
thought process from my side...

32:40.655 --> 32:42.965
I was like, "yeah, maybe
we are too different."

32:43.000 --> 32:44.724
It was a bit touch
and go at that point.

32:45.655 --> 32:48.034
[Narrator] As the
first week wore on,

32:48.068 --> 32:51.206
shuntelle rediscovered
her competitive streak.

32:51.241 --> 32:52.355
We stayed in a
hostel last night.

32:52.379 --> 32:53.659
Never stayed in a hostel before.

32:53.689 --> 32:54.931
We shared with how many people?

32:54.965 --> 32:56.165
- You did a dorm?
- [Jen] Yeah.

32:56.896 --> 32:58.448
Oh, you probably went... okay.

32:58.482 --> 33:02.344
Once I realized Jen had done
so much out of her comfort zone,

33:02.379 --> 33:04.896
then I was ready to
just put everything in.

33:04.931 --> 33:06.551
If she can do it, so can I.

33:07.689 --> 33:09.413
I can do it.

33:09.448 --> 33:12.448
- I think checkpoint two, we were like, "ok, game on."
- Yeah.

33:12.482 --> 33:15.655
-[Shuntelle] I have to woman up.
-Man up.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.862
I'm a woman so I'm womaning up.

33:18.551 --> 33:19.931
Keep breathing.

33:19.965 --> 33:22.137
- Keep focusing.
- Focus on the second leg.

33:22.172 --> 33:23.310
[Shuntelle laughs]

33:23.344 --> 33:25.544
Don't focus on the second
leg and make me go... [laughs]

33:26.344 --> 33:29.551
And had some
r&amp;R, good food...

33:29.586 --> 33:31.655
I slept on a lovely bed.

33:31.689 --> 33:32.758
I was ready.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.965
We want to least beat
who we left with today.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.137
That's our aim. They
were at the petrol station.

33:38.172 --> 33:40.965
They are standing there
doing nothing. High five, babe.

33:43.137 --> 33:45.551
I could see you get more
more competitive by the day.

33:46.965 --> 33:49.206
[Narrator] But shuntelle's
renewed determination

33:49.241 --> 33:52.000
faltered when disaster struck.

33:52.034 --> 33:53.827
[Michael] My money
belt's here, isn't it?

33:53.862 --> 33:56.965
All I heard Michael say is,
"I can't find my money belt."

33:57.000 --> 34:00.137
I just looked over. "What do you
mean you can't find your money belt?"

34:00.172 --> 34:02.620
-Back pockets?
-It's not here. Definitely not here.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.344
I was absolutely devastated
about the whole thing.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.068
I still am now, you know.

34:08.103 --> 34:10.586
We just wanted to complete
the journey with you guys there.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.793
I feel like that experience,
journey's being robbed.

34:12.827 --> 34:14.000
Well, we missed you.

34:14.034 --> 34:15.241
Yes, we did.

34:15.275 --> 34:18.413
It was like a piece of the
puzzle just gone, isn't it?

34:18.448 --> 34:20.413
[Michael] I've
messed it up. I'm sorry.

34:20.448 --> 34:23.655
I just need you to know
that we started as a team.

34:23.689 --> 34:26.241
So we, as a team,
have lost the money.

34:26.275 --> 34:29.068
I learned at that stage,
that she was on my side

34:29.103 --> 34:30.586
whatever the situation was.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.827
I learned that you had
that humility about you,

34:32.862 --> 34:35.827
and that made it easier
for me at that time.

34:35.862 --> 34:37.838
[Shuntelle] We knew our
journey was coming to an end,

34:37.862 --> 34:41.310
so we stopped the race
and went whale watching.

34:41.344 --> 34:44.448
I have not seen any
whales in my lifetime.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.931
[Shuntelle] Ah!

34:47.965 --> 34:49.586
That is so cool.

34:50.896 --> 34:52.000
Oh, wow.

34:52.551 --> 34:53.724
[Shuntelle laughs]

34:53.758 --> 34:56.965
I can't believe we're
so close to them as well.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.689
[Narrator] Since the race, life has
changed for Michael and shuntelle.

35:01.724 --> 35:04.620
[Shuntelle] Got back to
London, got back into normal life.

35:04.655 --> 35:06.862
Came to a conclusion
that, our relationship,

35:06.896 --> 35:08.206
we were gonna take a break.

35:08.241 --> 35:10.655
We get along, we
speak all the time.

35:10.689 --> 35:13.724
And I think our communications
have been a lot better too.

35:13.758 --> 35:15.862
[Jo] Well, if it just ends
up a good friendship,

35:15.896 --> 35:20.137
you can't go through that experience
without having a really strong bond.

35:20.172 --> 35:22.310
We're gonna be friends for life.

35:22.344 --> 35:25.448
I wouldn't have done the
journey with anybody else.

35:25.482 --> 35:28.379
He was definitely the only
person I would have done it with.

35:28.965 --> 35:30.344
Likewise.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.803
I'm sure you would've
found somebody.

35:31.827 --> 35:33.068
[All laughing]

35:33.103 --> 35:35.620
-[Shuntelle] Let's keep it real.
-[Michael] Okay.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.379
Nice try, Michael.

35:37.413 --> 35:38.827
[All laughing]

35:42.034 --> 35:45.448
145 for the hostel,
18 for the tube.

35:45.482 --> 35:46.862
Food, taxis...

35:46.896 --> 35:50.103
[Narrator] With only £26
each to spend per day,

35:50.137 --> 35:53.137
it wasn't just Michael and
shuntelle who had money troubles.

35:53.172 --> 35:54.320
So we started
the race in Mexico,

35:54.344 --> 35:58.379
we had £1,453 each.

35:59.620 --> 36:04.103
After 52 days of racing,
ended up with £3.38.

36:04.137 --> 36:07.586
[All laughing]

36:07.620 --> 36:11.862
Slept in some stupid places in
my life, but this is a first for me.

36:11.896 --> 36:14.034
There were some tricky
situations with the money.

36:14.068 --> 36:15.724
Yeah.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.976
There were days when we didn't have enough
money to get to the next destination.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.379
You kept bringing up that
you were low on your budget

36:20.413 --> 36:22.000
and I had set in my mind

36:22.034 --> 36:24.517
that you were just telling us
that, so we'd spend more money.

36:24.551 --> 36:26.320
But it was the truth though.
We were struggling for money.

36:26.344 --> 36:27.310
I know.

36:27.344 --> 36:28.631
[Emon] We had
days without eating.

36:28.655 --> 36:30.182
In the buses, when they
give you three biscuits,

36:30.206 --> 36:32.655
I'd go to the back and stuff
my bag with all the biscuits.

36:32.689 --> 36:35.068
We just had to hustle
our way to get through.

36:35.103 --> 36:38.689
[Narrator] Work was crucial in
securing extra funds needed to finish.

36:38.724 --> 36:40.244
[Jamiul] We've got
a lot to cover, man.

36:41.172 --> 36:43.068
We could do with
a jet wash here, lad.

36:43.103 --> 36:44.965
We did a lot of work
like washing the buses.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.379
Yeah, you left that to me.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.000
[Emon] Only the
top rim needs doing.

36:48.034 --> 36:49.310
I did a lot of work.

36:49.344 --> 36:51.344
You did a lot of like...

36:51.379 --> 36:53.137
It's called business
development.

36:53.172 --> 36:54.896
You gotta take, you know...

36:54.931 --> 36:56.448
Take a leadership role.

36:56.482 --> 36:59.241
[Jen] There's all pubes on
the back of that, by the way.

36:59.275 --> 37:01.103
I think I'll just do the walls.

37:01.137 --> 37:03.758
Honestly, there's
pubes everywhere.

37:03.793 --> 37:08.965
When I signed up for the race, I didn't
ever think I'd be cleaning toilets in a bus.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.586
[Narrator] Some jobs
were better than others.

37:11.620 --> 37:15.931
In Peru, Jen and Rob, spent a
day working at a bear sanctuary.

37:15.965 --> 37:18.620
But it wasn't just bears
they were looking after.

37:18.655 --> 37:22.413
So we have to clean
the herpetarium.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.724
- What's that?
- [Man] It's a place where we have some snakes.

37:25.758 --> 37:27.068
[Jen exclaims]

37:29.000 --> 37:33.517
Just terrified of spiders, snakes,
mice, terrified of all of those things.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.172
Who cleans the cage of a snake
whilst the snake's sitting there,

37:36.206 --> 37:37.724
especially if it's a
dangerous snake?

37:38.620 --> 37:39.724
Crazy.

37:40.931 --> 37:42.448
[Jen] Have you ever
done this before?

37:42.482 --> 37:44.241
[Rob] Never protected
my wife from a snake

37:44.275 --> 37:46.275
because she's too
busy window cleaning.

37:47.689 --> 37:51.275
We, as you know,
didn't do the final leg.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.482
[Sam] We ran out of money.

37:52.517 --> 37:53.724
[Jo] I struggled with it

37:53.758 --> 37:55.872
because the competitive side
of me wasn't about winning,

37:55.896 --> 37:57.689
it was about finishing it.

37:57.724 --> 38:02.000
So I was really upset to
not see you guys at the end.

38:02.034 --> 38:04.103
[Jo] Hey, guys.
[Jamiul] Come here.

38:04.137 --> 38:05.379
[Jamiul kissing Jo]

38:07.206 --> 38:10.586
Deciding to go home
was a real low point for me.

38:11.689 --> 38:14.000
Um, weirdly, I'm
about to cry again.

38:14.034 --> 38:15.241
Gordon Bennett.

38:15.275 --> 38:17.079
- [Lizzie] Lots going on.
- [Emon] How are we, guys?

38:17.103 --> 38:18.448
Uh...

38:18.482 --> 38:21.172
[Jo] We realized we
couldn't go on to the final leg.

38:21.206 --> 38:22.310
Aw!

38:22.344 --> 38:24.320
It's really sad not to
finish it, but it's brilliant

38:24.344 --> 38:25.620
to see you guys.

38:25.655 --> 38:27.931
[Jo] I don't give up. I'm
not really a giver upper.

38:27.965 --> 38:30.827
- She hates not finishing.
- Um, so, I struggled with that.

38:30.862 --> 38:32.758
[Indistinct conversation]

38:32.793 --> 38:34.517
It was in the back
of everyone's heads

38:34.551 --> 38:36.527
but you never really thought it
would have actually happened.

38:36.551 --> 38:37.448
Yeah.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.827
[Jo sobbing]

38:38.862 --> 38:40.965
It hit home that it could
happen to anybody.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.965
What's important is, we do need to
move fast, but we need to move cheap.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.148
[Dom] Oh my god. We've gotta
worry about our own pockets now.

38:47.172 --> 38:49.241
We were like, "we
cannot hit zero."

38:49.275 --> 38:51.000
[Lizzie] So, basically
it's scooping up poo.

38:51.034 --> 38:53.689
Who said it would be
fun working with horses?

38:53.724 --> 38:56.586
[Lizzie] You want
money? Stop complaining.

38:56.620 --> 38:58.286
[Dom] This was the
first instance in our life

38:58.310 --> 39:01.965
where this money that
we're making is for us to eat.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.655
And if we don't make that money,

39:03.689 --> 39:04.827
we don't eat.

39:04.862 --> 39:07.793
I think this is another
job ticked off the list

39:07.827 --> 39:10.448
of jobs I'm not sure I
wanna do when I'm older.

39:10.482 --> 39:13.103
It's definitely strengthened
us and hardened us.

39:13.137 --> 39:15.310
Made me appreciate
things a lot more.

39:15.344 --> 39:16.827
Oh! Cheers.

39:16.862 --> 39:21.862
- We finished with £18.39 over the finish line.
- [Jen] No way.

39:21.896 --> 39:24.172
We're not going to eat now
for like, three days, you know.

39:24.206 --> 39:26.103
- No.
- Not one thing.

39:26.137 --> 39:27.734
We were just so happy
to finish at the end.

39:27.758 --> 39:30.896
I was quite impressed at our
ability to blag and to hitchhike

39:30.931 --> 39:33.896
because we only finished, you
know, a few hours behind you guys.

39:33.931 --> 39:36.034
It's amazing what you can
achieve when you have to.

39:36.068 --> 39:38.137
Yeah, our strategy was basically

39:38.172 --> 39:40.137
keep a fund of money back...

39:40.172 --> 39:41.562
[Jen] To get you
over the finish line.

39:41.586 --> 39:44.551
If we could hire a helicopter and
chopper in, we were gonna do it.

39:44.586 --> 39:48.689
Just turned out that actually
money wasn't the key to winning.

39:48.724 --> 39:50.517
[All laughing]

39:50.551 --> 39:54.413
[Jen] And we ended with £45.83.

39:54.448 --> 39:56.665
We were very mean with our
money from the off, weren't we?

39:56.689 --> 39:58.275
We had a very strict budget.

40:02.413 --> 40:04.724
- Very scary, isn't it?
- I feel so heavy.

40:04.758 --> 40:06.344
- Now that it is real.
- I feel sick.

40:06.379 --> 40:07.758
[Jen chuckles]

40:07.793 --> 40:11.034
[Narrator] Jen and Rob, the
most unlikely pair of backpackers.

40:11.068 --> 40:12.734
[Rob] This journey is
going to be challenging.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.689
It'll challenge our
communication, won't it?

40:14.724 --> 40:16.068
Absolutely, yeah.

40:16.103 --> 40:18.482
We do struggle with
that from time to time.

40:18.517 --> 40:19.551
All the time.

40:19.586 --> 40:23.068
How are we even gonna
get like out of the city?

40:23.103 --> 40:24.310
I don't know.

40:24.344 --> 40:26.148
We knew we were just
average, you know, average Joes.

40:26.172 --> 40:27.551
Just Jen and Rob from reading.

40:27.586 --> 40:28.793
[Jen exhaling]

40:28.827 --> 40:30.034
Bloody hell.

40:30.068 --> 40:32.044
I didn't even own a backpack.
Never even owned trainers.

40:32.068 --> 40:34.241
This this like... Oh my god!

40:34.275 --> 40:35.344
I had no clue.

40:35.379 --> 40:37.275
[Rob] Okay. Gracias.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.448
Let me keep hold of
this. You asked a clown.

40:40.482 --> 40:42.758
We found it tough, didn't
we? The first two legs.

40:42.793 --> 40:44.103
I mean, i'm
absolutely exhausted.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.872
I've not slept for three days.
I've not showered in three days.

40:45.896 --> 40:47.182
I've had the same
pants on for four days.

40:47.206 --> 40:49.326
I'd like to brush my teeth.
I'd like a glass of water.

40:51.137 --> 40:52.872
[Jen] I think one of the
reasons why we wanted to do

40:52.896 --> 40:55.551
the race, communication
had definitely broken down.

40:55.586 --> 40:58.217
We perhaps were kind of, you know,
not as close as we should have been

40:58.241 --> 41:00.931
for a newly married couple, who
had just bought their first house.

41:00.965 --> 41:03.586
The stresses and
strains of everyday life,

41:03.620 --> 41:05.689
was just, like, almost a
barrier to remembering

41:05.724 --> 41:07.204
why we're together
in the first place.

41:08.379 --> 41:10.517
[Rob] We started
realizing that actually

41:10.551 --> 41:12.551
you've got to be in a
good place with each other.

41:12.586 --> 41:13.689
Can't be stressed.

41:13.724 --> 41:15.655
You're going through
these amazing places.

41:15.689 --> 41:17.689
- Stunning, isn't it?
- Gorgeous.

41:17.724 --> 41:19.044
[Rob] You've got
to experience them.

41:19.068 --> 41:21.241
You'll just regret it
for the rest of your life.

41:21.275 --> 41:23.034
[Jen] I like time
out from the race.

41:23.068 --> 41:24.941
[Rob] Stressed Jen isn't
the best form of Jen, is it?

41:24.965 --> 41:26.103
No.

41:26.137 --> 41:29.448
[Rob] You're given this
amazing opportunity and...

41:29.482 --> 41:32.172
You're throwing it away if
you don't look at the places

41:32.206 --> 41:33.310
that you pass.

41:33.344 --> 41:34.965
[Rob] Watch your bum.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.344
[Bear growls]

41:36.379 --> 41:37.793
[Jen] You sneaky little boy.

41:37.827 --> 41:40.103
Definitely worth
the trip to get here.

41:40.137 --> 41:42.448
Over time, we began
to really carefully

41:42.482 --> 41:46.241
pick our journeys to go through
places that we were desperate to go to.

41:46.275 --> 41:48.631
[Rob] It was hard to find that
balance between race and experience.

41:48.655 --> 41:51.275
[Jen] It was. I
think we did nail it.

41:51.310 --> 41:54.172
We'd say, "right, we got four
hours now, before the next bus,

41:54.206 --> 41:56.000
let's go and have an
amazing experience

41:56.034 --> 41:58.655
for four hours and then come
back and, boom, the race starts."

41:58.689 --> 41:59.896
That was a good strategy.

41:59.931 --> 42:01.206
[Rob] I don't have any regrets.

42:01.241 --> 42:02.355
[Jen] That sums
it up, doesn't it?

42:02.379 --> 42:05.379
No regrets. So we
did something right.

42:05.413 --> 42:06.758
[Rob] Can you see up there?

42:06.793 --> 42:10.034
[Jen] Oh, look at
that. Iguazu falls.

42:10.068 --> 42:12.586
[Birds screeching]

42:15.034 --> 42:18.034
That is the best view
I've ever seen in my life.

42:18.068 --> 42:19.482
[Jen] And sharing
those kind of...

42:19.517 --> 42:20.517
[Rob] Moments.

42:20.551 --> 42:22.034
Awesome experiences.

42:22.068 --> 42:24.896
That's like a
therapy itself, isn't it?

42:24.931 --> 42:26.241
That's healing.

42:26.275 --> 42:27.137
It unites us, doesn't it?

42:27.172 --> 42:28.412
- Yeah.
- We're stronger for it.

42:28.862 --> 42:29.862
Exactly that.

42:30.793 --> 42:33.793
From my point of view,
the outside looking in,

42:33.827 --> 42:36.310
you just seem to be
such a brilliant team.

42:36.344 --> 42:39.517
Have a laugh together,
communicate individually and together.

42:39.551 --> 42:41.758
You seem to work brilliantly.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.931
I definitely feel that we've
got stronger and stronger.

42:43.965 --> 42:45.172
We had to get worse first.

42:45.206 --> 42:50.241
- Ow! I said don't rip it.
- You want anything out of it?

42:50.275 --> 42:54.379
Yes. I told you not to
rip my [bleep] arms off!

42:54.413 --> 42:56.286
[Jen] But I think when
we just hit that wonderful,

42:56.310 --> 43:00.206
harmonious team work,
it was the making of us.

43:00.241 --> 43:03.206
[Both screaming]

43:04.172 --> 43:05.413
[Chuckling] Yes!

43:06.379 --> 43:07.838
[Rob] You can see
her confidence grow.

43:07.862 --> 43:09.862
I think that's making
her a happier person,

43:09.896 --> 43:13.586
which is nice and that, that
makes me happy. [Chuckles]

43:13.620 --> 43:16.241
I'm canoeing! I'm canoeing!

43:16.862 --> 43:18.793
We've grown stronger

43:18.827 --> 43:20.344
because we're being kinder.

43:20.379 --> 43:22.862
[Jen] Oh, Robbie, I can't do it.

43:22.896 --> 43:24.931
- You can, you're almost there.
- I'm gonna cry.

43:25.517 --> 43:26.793
[Jen groaning]

43:26.827 --> 43:28.424
[Rob] What's the matter?
What's the matter?

43:28.448 --> 43:30.137
Almost there. Almost there.

43:30.172 --> 43:32.310
You're stronger than
you can ever imagine.

43:32.344 --> 43:33.824
- We're so close now.
- [Jen sniffles]

43:34.448 --> 43:35.655
And we're being kinder

43:35.689 --> 43:37.517
because we've
grown as individuals.

43:38.551 --> 43:40.344
You're nice.

43:40.379 --> 43:42.103
Coming out the
other end of the race,

43:42.137 --> 43:44.724
I feel like I've become
more comfortable

43:44.758 --> 43:46.379
with my hearing loss.

43:46.413 --> 43:48.482
It doesn't stop me
from doing anything.

43:48.517 --> 43:50.965
And that's allowed
me to go to loud bars.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.724
Yeah, I'm not going
to hear people,

43:52.758 --> 43:54.251
I'm not really going to
understand what they say

43:54.275 --> 43:56.655
- but you can still have a laugh, can't you?
- [Chuckles]

43:56.689 --> 43:58.482
It doesn't stop me
from succeeding.

43:58.517 --> 44:01.000
And I think this race
has kind of proved that.

44:01.034 --> 44:02.793
[Jen] I can't do this, Robbie.

44:02.827 --> 44:04.000
[Rob] You can. We're a team.

44:04.931 --> 44:06.551
I love how this
journey has made you

44:06.586 --> 44:08.103
a lot more adventurous.

44:08.137 --> 44:09.482
And our holidays from now on,

44:09.517 --> 44:12.310
are not going to be
all-inclusive style hotels.

44:12.344 --> 44:13.965
We want to engage
with local culture.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.310
We want to go somewhere new.

44:15.344 --> 44:17.137
Definitely be less
like planny, planny,

44:17.172 --> 44:18.803
'cause I plan down
to every single second.

44:18.827 --> 44:20.148
I'd be happy just
to get off a plane

44:20.172 --> 44:22.448
and be like, "I wonder where
we'll be sleeping tonight?"

44:22.482 --> 44:25.241
Like, I genuinely would
be quite happy to do that,

44:25.275 --> 44:28.206
after I've had my
first luxury holiday.

44:28.241 --> 44:29.689
[Laughs]

44:31.793 --> 44:33.103
All aboard!

44:33.137 --> 44:34.482
[Mimicking train hooting]

44:35.827 --> 44:37.700
[Narrator] The need to
follow the cheapest routes

44:37.724 --> 44:40.344
led teams to sometimes
bump into each other

44:40.379 --> 44:41.551
when they least expected it.

44:41.586 --> 44:43.758
- Dom and Lizzie.
- Jamiul and emon.

44:43.793 --> 44:45.965
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

44:46.000 --> 44:47.965
How are you doing?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.217
- It was like a little treat every time, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

44:50.241 --> 44:51.655
- Exactly.
- It was like, "ooh."

44:51.689 --> 44:53.206
Wazzup!

44:53.241 --> 44:55.103
[All laughing]

44:55.137 --> 44:58.793
It's like sort of seeing family
along the way, wasn't it?

44:58.827 --> 45:00.896
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Good to see you.

45:00.931 --> 45:02.000
[Indistinct]

45:02.034 --> 45:03.689
- [Sam] Familiar faces.
- [Jo] Yeah.

45:03.724 --> 45:05.524
It was just lovely. It
was lovely seeing them.

45:08.310 --> 45:10.827
[Narrator] But they weren't
always thrilled to see each other.

45:10.862 --> 45:11.827
[Jen] They're on our bus.

45:11.862 --> 45:13.724
And the only seats
are next to me.

45:13.758 --> 45:15.310
- Now, Lizzie.
- Yeah.

45:15.344 --> 45:17.493
- Don't tell them everything we've done.
- No, I won't. Don't worry.

45:17.517 --> 45:18.941
- And don't tell them where we're going.
- Don't...

45:18.965 --> 45:20.931
[Cackles]

45:20.965 --> 45:22.344
[Bleep]

45:22.379 --> 45:23.793
Have you chosen the route yet?

45:23.827 --> 45:26.000
- We have no idea where we're going.
- [Both chuckling]

45:26.034 --> 45:28.620
Your face was, "don't
look at him. Don't even..."

45:28.655 --> 45:30.862
"be quiet, Rob.
Don't say anything."

45:30.896 --> 45:32.389
I think as soon as you
bumped into someone,

45:32.413 --> 45:33.793
something snapped in you, like,

45:33.827 --> 45:35.862
"oh, my god." You
make rash decisions.

45:35.896 --> 45:37.803
You start worrying too much
about what they're doing...

45:37.827 --> 45:39.206
- Yes.
- And it changes your plan,

45:39.241 --> 45:41.000
and then you get in
each other's heads

45:41.034 --> 45:42.103
and gets very competitive.

45:42.137 --> 45:43.103
- Whoo!
- Yes!

45:43.137 --> 45:44.275
Jen and Rob are here.

45:45.068 --> 45:46.827
[Jen] I feel really sneaky.

45:46.862 --> 45:48.586
But then I feel, like,
really, like, happy

45:48.620 --> 45:49.931
that I've been sneaky.

45:49.965 --> 45:51.379
How were we sneaky?

45:51.413 --> 45:53.793
Rob, I hid in bushes
so people didn't see me.

45:53.827 --> 45:55.862
Robbie, Robbie,
Robbie, Robbie, Robbie.

45:56.344 --> 45:57.551
What's this? What?

45:57.586 --> 46:00.172
I think emon was
really competitive.

46:00.206 --> 46:02.448
At checkpoints,
it was nice emon,

46:02.482 --> 46:04.103
and then as soon
as the race started,

46:04.137 --> 46:05.482
it was blinkers on, go.

46:05.517 --> 46:06.758
It was puno for me.

46:06.793 --> 46:09.068
We were literally like this.

46:09.103 --> 46:10.655
- [Jen] I feel terrible.
- [Man coughs]

46:11.034 --> 46:12.275
[Sighs]

46:12.310 --> 46:14.044
They are your friends and
you really want them to do well.

46:14.068 --> 46:16.034
But at the same time,
you want to do better.

46:16.068 --> 46:17.275
[Breathing heavily]

46:17.310 --> 46:19.113
I looked behind and you
were having an asthma attack

46:19.137 --> 46:20.689
- and I was like, "yes!"
- [All laugh]

46:20.724 --> 46:22.689
"He's on oxygen,
Robbie. Leg it!"

46:22.724 --> 46:23.862
[All laughing]

46:23.896 --> 46:25.793
I mean, how awful is that!

46:25.827 --> 46:27.493
[Emon] We have so
much love for Jen and Rob.

46:27.517 --> 46:29.044
I don't think they have
so much love for me.

46:29.068 --> 46:32.000
She's already wished death
on me a couple of times so...

46:32.758 --> 46:34.103
Jen will be Jen!

46:38.551 --> 46:40.000
México.

46:40.034 --> 46:42.862
[Narrator] Uncle and
nephew, emon and jamiul,

46:42.896 --> 46:45.896
were looking to reconnect
after a family estrangement.

46:45.931 --> 46:47.241
[Jamiul] In the past 10 years,

46:47.275 --> 46:50.068
I don't think we've
spent a full day together.

46:50.103 --> 46:51.034
Let's do this.

46:51.068 --> 46:52.068
Come on!

46:54.448 --> 46:55.689
[Both laughing]

46:55.724 --> 46:57.655
[Emon] Initially, we said
we were gonna be quick.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.344
And we sort of the team to beat.

47:00.482 --> 47:02.620
I think we're way
ahead of everybody else.

47:02.655 --> 47:04.079
As soon as we get
to palenque, that's it.

47:04.103 --> 47:06.310
Give the others a
chance to catch up to us.

47:06.344 --> 47:07.827
Yeah, okay.

47:07.862 --> 47:09.379
It definitely backfired on us.

47:10.517 --> 47:13.931
Guys, I'm sorry, we don't
have any more tickets.

47:13.965 --> 47:16.251
[Emon] Twenty-four hours behind
now because we've missed the boat.

47:16.275 --> 47:17.896
It's a big, big problem for us.

47:19.344 --> 47:21.827
I came into the
race quite confident.

47:21.862 --> 47:23.758
I've done a lot of expeditions.

47:23.793 --> 47:26.137
I thought my experience
would benefit us.

47:26.758 --> 47:27.758
[Both grunt]

47:28.758 --> 47:30.896
But I really underestimated it.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.971
It was nothing like what
I've done before in my life.

47:34.241 --> 47:35.241
Damn!

47:36.034 --> 47:39.103
We ended up coming
last in the first leg.

47:39.137 --> 47:40.586
I think it comes down to,

47:40.620 --> 47:43.620
us not really connecting well at
the beginning of the race, isn't it?

47:43.655 --> 47:45.275
And obviously, we
didn't know each other.

47:45.310 --> 47:48.000
We didn't know what our strengths
were, what our weaknesses were.

47:51.103 --> 47:54.827
[Narrator] Their strategy to
catch up: Splash the cash.

47:54.862 --> 47:56.034
[Man] To the border?

47:56.068 --> 47:57.068
[Indistinct conversation]

47:57.551 --> 47:58.517
160. Yeah.

47:58.551 --> 48:00.172
- [Man] All right.
- [Emon] Okay.

48:00.206 --> 48:03.344
The money that we spent on
the first two legs crippled us.

48:03.379 --> 48:05.413
And we felt it for
the rest of the race.

48:06.620 --> 48:08.448
We're $400 over our budget.

48:09.379 --> 48:10.424
It was a [bleep]
show, wasn't it?

48:10.448 --> 48:11.862
[Laughs] It was a [bleep] show.

48:14.310 --> 48:16.620
[Narrator] To get back in
the game, they had to hustle.

48:16.655 --> 48:17.689
[Indistinct conversation]

48:18.206 --> 48:19.172
$10.

48:19.206 --> 48:20.965
You can do cheaper than that.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.172
You're kidding me? Murder.

48:23.862 --> 48:24.862
[In Spanish]

48:26.517 --> 48:27.517
[In English] No?

48:29.586 --> 48:31.551
This is hard, man. [Grunts]

48:31.586 --> 48:34.586
We'll clean yours after if you like us
to, but you have to pay us top dollar.

48:36.068 --> 48:37.172
A jungle trek!

48:37.206 --> 48:38.379
This is cool.

48:38.413 --> 48:40.453
[Narrator] And as they
got a foothold in the race...

48:40.931 --> 48:41.931
Phew!

48:42.896 --> 48:44.241
Give me some, man.

48:44.275 --> 48:47.413
[Narrator] Their understanding
of each other grew.

48:47.448 --> 48:50.000
[Emon] I thought, yes, it's
gonna be an amazing race.

48:50.034 --> 48:52.000
We'll see some amazing
places, amazing countries.

48:52.034 --> 48:53.241
Let's do it.

48:53.275 --> 48:55.206
[Jamiul] Ah, that
feels good, isn't it?

48:55.241 --> 48:56.310
We did it, eh?

48:56.344 --> 49:00.620
I just did not expect the
connection that we had.

49:00.655 --> 49:02.103
I'm proud of you.

49:02.137 --> 49:05.137
I feel more close to him
than I ever have been.

49:06.241 --> 49:09.068
I was always thinking
of the wider picture.

49:09.103 --> 49:11.379
[Narrator] In valle
De la Luna, Bolivia,

49:11.413 --> 49:14.793
jamiul built up the courage
to seek some answers.

49:14.827 --> 49:18.137
Why is it exactly that
you left the family?

49:18.172 --> 49:22.206
My dad was set that I should
settle down and get married.

49:22.241 --> 49:26.448
About 15 years ago, you'd get married
to the person your mum and dad said.

49:26.482 --> 49:28.689
That was the bengali culture.

49:28.724 --> 49:31.172
I didn't see that as my future.

49:31.206 --> 49:34.448
[Jamiul] I had so many
questions over the past decade.

49:34.482 --> 49:37.137
I had asked so many family
members what's going on?

49:37.172 --> 49:38.758
Um, never got the right answer,

49:38.793 --> 49:42.965
so it was just really nice to be able
to get those answers from you direct.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.172
[Emon] Give me a bro hug.

49:47.103 --> 49:48.183
[Jamiul] I missed you, man.

49:49.517 --> 49:50.941
I'm spending more
time with my family now,

49:50.965 --> 49:53.241
and that's what the
trip's made me realize.

49:53.275 --> 49:55.586
I mean, time is
always against us.

49:56.275 --> 49:57.586
Mission accomplished.

49:57.620 --> 49:58.965
[All laughing]

49:59.000 --> 50:00.137
You could say that.

50:02.931 --> 50:06.068
I'd lost connection with
my father for 10 years.

50:06.103 --> 50:07.206
[All greeting in Spanish]

50:07.241 --> 50:09.862
I've started to make
my time up with my dad.

50:09.896 --> 50:11.103
Pick any card. This one, eh?

50:11.137 --> 50:13.241
So I'm spending as much
time as I can with him.

50:13.275 --> 50:16.862
[Emon speaking Spanish]

50:16.896 --> 50:19.000
I finished the
adventurous side of my life,

50:19.034 --> 50:22.379
and I'm kind of ready to settle
down and start my own family now.

50:22.413 --> 50:24.000
Do the normal things.

50:26.655 --> 50:29.413
I knew that if we went
on this journey together,

50:29.448 --> 50:31.000
it would bring our
families together.

50:31.034 --> 50:33.620
It was the mission. It
was... It was the aim,

50:33.655 --> 50:35.310
and I'm happy
that it's happened.

50:35.344 --> 50:38.241
I'm really glad that
the family embraced it.

50:38.275 --> 50:39.862
[Jamiul] It is really nice.

50:39.896 --> 50:43.206
My auntie told me that he said my name
in his dream a couple of times as well.

50:43.241 --> 50:44.448
- Really?
- [Woman] Wow!

50:44.482 --> 50:47.275
Fifty-two days together,
like, in each other's pockets.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.551
And as soon as I got back...

50:48.586 --> 50:51.275
I think the first night, I woke
up and went, "where's jam?"

50:51.310 --> 50:52.862
[All laughing]

50:54.172 --> 50:57.034
Can't get him away from me
nowadays. Always at my house.

50:57.068 --> 50:58.827
What you lying for? [Laughs]

50:58.862 --> 51:00.655
I'm actually... [laughs]

51:00.689 --> 51:04.620
I came back from work and
laz goes, "jam's in the garage."

51:04.655 --> 51:08.068
I said, "you what? What's
he doing?" "I don't know."

51:08.103 --> 51:10.379
You were just sat
there, watching TV.

51:12.310 --> 51:14.448
[Music playing]

51:18.103 --> 51:21.724
It's finally here.
Boom. It's ushuaia time.

51:24.413 --> 51:28.482
[Narrator] The last leg saw teams
jostle back and forth throughout patagonia.

51:28.517 --> 51:31.310
[Truck horn honking]

51:31.344 --> 51:32.965
[Jen] Stuff the money.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.758
We're not settling
for less than first.

51:37.241 --> 51:38.241
God, this is risky.

51:39.793 --> 51:42.310
[Narrator] With just one
bus a day from rio gallegos...

51:42.344 --> 51:43.758
Oh, my god.

51:43.793 --> 51:47.137
600 kilometers from ushuaia,
the remaining three teams

51:47.172 --> 51:49.241
came face to face
with each other.

51:49.275 --> 51:50.724
Oh, my goodness.

51:50.758 --> 51:54.758
After 50 odd days of racing,
when we all arrived at that bus stop,

51:54.793 --> 51:56.137
it was just remarkable.

51:56.172 --> 51:59.448
-All three of us here.
-Oh, don't. This is nerve-wracking.

52:00.724 --> 52:03.620
[Narrator] The race
was well and truly on.

52:03.655 --> 52:05.965
The moment we realized
we weren't going to win...

52:06.000 --> 52:07.137
Ushuaia?

52:07.172 --> 52:09.034
Hola. ushuaia? Sí.

52:09.068 --> 52:11.482
We saw Jen and Rob, and
jamiul and emon jump into taxis,

52:11.517 --> 52:14.000
and we were like... Rats!

52:16.827 --> 52:19.586
[Narrator] A cash-strapped dom
and Lizzie were forced to hitchhike.

52:20.275 --> 52:22.000
Huh? No! No!

52:23.724 --> 52:25.862
[Narrator] It came down
to emon and jamiul...

52:25.896 --> 52:27.517
Rápido, yeah?

52:27.551 --> 52:29.103
Versus Jen and Rob.

52:29.137 --> 52:30.724
- Oh, we're here.
- Oh my god!

52:30.758 --> 52:34.241
And one team turned to the skills
they'd applied throughout the race.

52:34.275 --> 52:36.172
We're gonna have
to dump these bags.

52:36.206 --> 52:38.344
[Narrator] Just when
it mattered most.

52:38.379 --> 52:40.482
Oh my days!

52:40.517 --> 52:42.620
To get the last taxi, we
didn't have enough money.

52:42.655 --> 52:44.896
- Yeah.
- What did we have to give away?

52:44.931 --> 52:49.758
My mp3s, which you
told him were iPods.

52:49.793 --> 52:51.034
[Both laugh]

52:51.068 --> 52:54.275
These iPods. $100 each.

52:54.310 --> 52:55.379
- Okay.
- Gracias, yeah?

52:55.413 --> 52:56.793
Gracias.

52:56.827 --> 52:59.034
[Dom] But you showed a
lot of wit and a lot of hustle

52:59.068 --> 53:00.965
which put you in
the position you're in.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.965
And even on the
final bit of the race,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.103
you didn't have enough
money to get to the end.

53:05.137 --> 53:08.413
But you managed to find a
way to get to that finish line.

53:08.448 --> 53:10.517
Can we leave our bags here?

53:10.551 --> 53:12.413
[Jen] Oh god!

53:12.448 --> 53:15.827
[Dramatic music playing]

53:15.862 --> 53:18.551
[Jen mock cries]

53:18.586 --> 53:23.482
Going around that corner and
seeing them, I could even cry now.

53:23.517 --> 53:25.241
- Ah.
- They're here.

53:25.275 --> 53:27.206
How the hell are you here first?

53:27.241 --> 53:29.103
[Jen] The final bus stop,

53:29.137 --> 53:31.827
final journey to
the final checkpoint.

53:31.862 --> 53:33.206
Where's your bags?

53:33.241 --> 53:35.482
- No way. [Laughs]
- Don't even.

53:35.517 --> 53:39.034
Without their bags on,
you know, ready to race.

53:39.068 --> 53:41.655
I'm so disappointed.

53:41.689 --> 53:44.482
Heartbroken, because, yeah,
it just dawned on me then,

53:44.517 --> 53:46.482
like we've lost,
we've got no hope.

53:46.517 --> 53:49.724
We outran the boys last time.
Believe in yourself. We can do it.

53:49.758 --> 53:52.517
- All right. Go!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

53:52.551 --> 53:55.000
Oh god, no! [Cries]

53:55.724 --> 53:57.413
We were closest to Jen and Rob

53:57.448 --> 53:59.769
because we spent the most amount
of time with them at checkpoints.

53:59.793 --> 54:03.551
When we heard Jen scream
that was heartbreaking.

54:03.586 --> 54:05.862
We can cut ahead to the road.

54:05.896 --> 54:08.379
- Can't see them.
- [Rob] Run strong, hon.

54:09.655 --> 54:10.758
They're behind us.

54:10.793 --> 54:12.793
Keep moving. Keep
those legs moving.

54:12.827 --> 54:14.517
We put so much
into that last leg.

54:15.172 --> 54:16.241
[Jen yells]

54:16.275 --> 54:17.275
Go.

54:18.241 --> 54:19.448
This is not it.

54:19.482 --> 54:20.655
This is it. This is it.

54:20.689 --> 54:22.103
- Come on!
- Where's the blue line?

54:23.551 --> 54:25.000
Come on!

54:26.413 --> 54:29.206
[Gasping]

54:31.482 --> 54:33.275
Oh, my god.

54:33.310 --> 54:34.793
We did it.

54:35.310 --> 54:37.310
Are you ready?

54:37.344 --> 54:40.241
Just reaching the top
of that peak in ushuaia.

54:40.275 --> 54:43.827
That was... Monumental for us.

54:43.862 --> 54:48.068
Relax. Relax. Get
my name in there.

54:48.862 --> 54:51.689
[Indistinct chatter]

54:51.724 --> 54:54.862
We did it. And I loved
every second of it.

54:54.896 --> 54:56.551
Literally just got there.

54:57.241 --> 54:58.620
[Jen cries]

54:59.413 --> 55:01.758
Well done, boys.

55:01.793 --> 55:04.551
[Indistinct conversation]

55:12.000 --> 55:13.862
[Emon] Look around you.

55:13.896 --> 55:15.724
Look at this. This is
what it's all been for.

55:18.137 --> 55:20.551
You know what? I think we
made up for ten years' time, eh?

55:21.586 --> 55:23.448
[Dramatic music playing]

55:23.482 --> 55:25.137
[Both whoop in unison]

55:26.068 --> 55:29.103
It was close. It was so close.

55:29.137 --> 55:31.586
That's what makes
it so much worse.

55:31.620 --> 55:34.217
You just had to have one more asthma
attack and it would've been me, mate.

55:34.241 --> 55:36.689
[All laugh]

55:36.724 --> 55:38.137
They're definitely deserving.

55:38.172 --> 55:41.448
Not only did they beat us at
the final stretch, fair and square...

55:41.482 --> 55:44.689
One of the hardest
things I've done in my life.

55:44.724 --> 55:47.379
But the money is going to
a good place, which is nice.

55:47.413 --> 55:48.862
Yeah.

55:48.896 --> 55:50.596
The children we've
seen throughout the trip,

55:50.620 --> 55:52.896
always had, you know,
a place in my heart.

55:52.931 --> 55:54.793
I want to give what
I can to them kids.

55:54.827 --> 55:57.103
My father has an
orphanage in Bangladesh.

55:57.137 --> 55:58.965
To give back the
children of saão Paulo,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.758
the children of Bangladesh
will be a great honor.

56:01.793 --> 56:04.448
So we'll donate
£10,000 to charities

56:04.482 --> 56:06.620
to help kids on the street.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.172
It should not be like this.

56:10.068 --> 56:13.068
I've got to say, you
know, the whole race,

56:13.103 --> 56:16.068
I think you were probably the
most altruistic out of all of us.

56:16.103 --> 56:17.931
You're both amazing guys.

56:17.965 --> 56:20.655
You two are definitely
worthy winners. Deserved it.

56:20.689 --> 56:22.655
- You're definitely deserving.
- I'm furious.

56:22.689 --> 56:24.724
[All laughing]

56:24.758 --> 56:26.413
Actually, I forgot how mad I am.

56:26.448 --> 56:28.758
- So close!
- I'm not over it.

56:30.482 --> 56:36.241
[Narrator] After 54 days, these ten
brits took on the challenge of a lifetime.

56:36.275 --> 56:38.103
The race has
definitely changed me.

56:38.137 --> 56:41.448
Drinking tea in a cloud forest.
This is, like, the best day of my life.

56:41.482 --> 56:42.827
Cheers.

56:42.862 --> 56:44.758
[Jen] Definitely
more adventurous.

56:44.793 --> 56:46.275
[Rob] Definitely.

56:46.310 --> 56:47.862
[Jen laughs]

56:47.896 --> 56:49.206
That's the real win.

56:50.827 --> 56:52.862
I loved being part
of the adventure.

56:52.896 --> 56:55.413
- Today is holiday day.
- Hear the music.

56:55.448 --> 56:58.172
- Party vibe. Let's go!
- Let's go and party.

56:58.206 --> 57:00.517
Would I do it again?
Hundred percent.

57:01.413 --> 57:03.689
It's just such a
different experience.

57:03.724 --> 57:06.448
- Hey, we made it.
- Finally made it.

57:06.482 --> 57:08.068
Oh, wow.

57:08.103 --> 57:10.310
And this is just the start.

57:10.344 --> 57:11.724
[Sam] Day two.

57:11.758 --> 57:14.241
[Sam] You know, we've got
memories to last us forever.

57:15.931 --> 57:18.896
[Sam] An experience that
will stay in my head for life.

57:19.896 --> 57:22.620
This is just what
dreams are made of.

57:23.172 --> 57:24.448
Run, dom.

57:24.482 --> 57:26.965
The race was crazy.

57:27.793 --> 57:29.068
Absolutely mental.

57:29.103 --> 57:30.689
- There's a dolphin.
- Oh, there!

57:31.413 --> 57:32.620
Oh my god!

57:32.655 --> 57:34.344
It's like two months
of intense therapy.

57:35.241 --> 57:38.275
You're my sister
and I do love you.

57:38.310 --> 57:39.896
Okay?

57:39.931 --> 57:42.631
We've really got to look at ourselves
and be really proud of what we did.

57:42.655 --> 57:44.172
Dom. There you go.

[Dom cheers]

57:46.241 --> 57:48.758
We'll look back at that for
the rest of our lives, I think.

57:50.275 --> 57:53.310
This trip has been
remarkable in so many ways.

57:53.344 --> 57:57.000
I wanna feel it all,
feel it in my fingertips.

57:57.034 --> 57:59.103
And we'll forever be grateful.

57:59.137 --> 58:00.517
Rocky couldn't do this.

58:00.551 --> 58:03.103
Met some incredible,
remarkable people.

58:03.137 --> 58:05.896
Oh, my god. Wow.

58:05.931 --> 58:08.000
I've never seen that
many fish in my life.

58:08.034 --> 58:10.275
It's helped reconnect ourselves.

58:10.310 --> 58:12.758
- I've got a lot of love for you, man.
- Thanks, brother.

58:12.793 --> 58:14.620
We're very lucky to
have been part of it.

58:14.655 --> 58:17.103
Yes! Come on!

58:18.103 --> 58:21.000
