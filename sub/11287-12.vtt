Oh.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.566
Hello, ladies.

00:27.633 --> 00:31.633
Hello, you look like you
could use a little bit of TLC.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.800
‐ Hm.
‐ That's right.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.866
We thought we'd warm you up.

00:34.933 --> 00:36.866
Yeah, well, you're doin'
a marvelous job.

00:36.933 --> 00:39.466
I sweated clear through
to the box springs, girl.

00:41.866 --> 00:46.833
And we've got some ideas to
how to keep you warm all night.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.266
Oh, could you be thinking
about a little

00:49.333 --> 00:51.600

00:53.700 --> 00:57.400
Overton, man,
it is 1 o'clock in the mornin'.

00:57.466 --> 01:01.373
I've got a early meeting with
Japanese investors tomorrow

01:01.440 --> 01:05.340
and if I yawn,
then there will be no yen.

01:06.473 --> 01:08.406
Ah!

01:09.873 --> 01:12.673
Hey, man, what the hell
you're doing waking me up?

01:12.740 --> 01:16.640
Man, I'm dreaming
I was in bed with TLC, dude!

01:16.706 --> 01:19.806
And we were, we were getting
along quite nicely.

01:19.873 --> 01:21.573
Thank you very much.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.440
You know, that is better
than your usual dream

01:23.506 --> 01:25.473
of the dance
of the sugar plum hand drill.

01:26.740 --> 01:27.806
Oh, no, Kyle.

01:27.873 --> 01:31.573
I mean, me dreaming about TLC.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.873
What does that say
about Synclaire now?

01:33.940 --> 01:36.740
I mean, uh, am I unfulfilled?

01:36.806 --> 01:39.740
Do I like more fiber
in my spiritual diet?

01:41.073 --> 01:43.673
‐ Overton, you my cat, right?
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

01:43.740 --> 01:45.040
So, I am gonna
give your problem

Good news, everyone,

02:29.080 --> 02:30.280
And I've got
the day off tomorrow

02:30.346 --> 02:33.613
so I'm here a‐a‐a‐ll night.

02:36.380 --> 02:38.080
Well, then have a seat,
your couch dent

02:38.146 --> 02:40.080
from last night
hasn't popped yet.

02:42.113 --> 02:43.846
Did you ever think
about coming upstairs

02:43.913 --> 02:46.180
and putting a few dents
in my couch? Huh?

02:47.380 --> 02:49.613
I don't know, you're too picky
about your sofa.

02:53.046 --> 02:54.480
Hi.

02:56.013 --> 02:58.880
Let me guess, uh,
your audition went great

02:58.946 --> 03:01.686
but you are perfecting your role
as a funeral attendant?

03:03.920 --> 03:06.020
Oh, save it, Overton.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.753
As usual, I didn't get the part.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.186
What, did they give
you that crap about

03:10.253 --> 03:12.686
you not being
right for the role?

03:12.753 --> 03:15.386
It was a commercial
for Afro Sheen.

03:15.453 --> 03:19.286
They said, I wasn't
<i>ethnic enough</i>

03:19.353 --> 03:22.586
and then they gave the part to a
white girl with a curly perm.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.153
That's better than that time
you lost

03:27.220 --> 03:29.353
that Playtex commercial
to that man.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.520
[laughing]

03:33.120 --> 03:35.820
Well, you got another audition
tomorrow, right?

03:35.886 --> 03:39.620
Yeah, but I'm not going,
so I don't need tomorrow off.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.720
But I already hired a temp.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.386
We were gonna get
a lot of work done.

03:44.453 --> 03:47.153
And nothing was gonna
get lost or forgotten

03:47.220 --> 03:50.420
or accidentally
put to the shredder.

03:50.486 --> 03:53.986
Synclaire, now look, there
are a thousand other things

03:54.053 --> 03:56.820
better suited to you
than acting.

03:56.886 --> 03:59.960
Bottle recycling, and that's
just off the top of my head.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.193
Don't listen to her, sweetpea.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.660
I stuck with my dream
of being a handyman

04:06.726 --> 04:11.026
and the reward is a lifetime of
meaningful and satisfying work.

04:11.093 --> 04:14.526
Oh, yeah, that reminds me, uh,
Mrs. Browner from 4‐B called

04:14.593 --> 04:15.860
and she said,
"Thanks for lubricating

04:15.926 --> 04:16.860
that paper towel rack."

04:16.926 --> 04:18.860
Mm‐hmm.

04:22.626 --> 04:25.860
Synclaire, I don't win
all of my court cases

04:25.926 --> 04:27.660
but you don't see me quitting.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.693
Yeah, but, Max, at least
you win some of 'em.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.926
Most. Most will be right.

04:32.993 --> 04:34.859
Seventy‐three out of ninety‐five

04:34.926 --> 04:36.526
a record for a public defender

04:36.593 --> 04:39.093
in the New York County with
nine months or less on the job.

04:39.159 --> 04:40.860
Thank you very much.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.693
Alright, listen,
the point is you can't win

04:45.760 --> 04:49.660
if you don't show up to court,
so suck it up, keep trying.

04:49.726 --> 04:53.060
Max, you really think
I could be a great actress?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.526
Don't change the subject, okay?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.100
I said don't quit.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.666
You know something?

05:04.733 --> 05:07.066
That idea is so crazy,
it just might work.

05:08.733 --> 05:11.700
I am going
to that audition tomorrow.

05:11.766 --> 05:14.233
By Gom, I am gonna get it.
Goodnight all.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.133
Well, uh,
dream of me, Synclaire.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.533
I‐I'll try my best
to dream of you.

05:22.966 --> 05:25.666
Synclaire, why are you going
to bed? It's only 8 o'clock.

05:25.733 --> 05:27.833
Well, the audition
is in New Jersey at 7 a. m.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.100
and I got to get up at 4:30
to catch the train.

05:30.166 --> 05:34.100
Oh, no. Max will drive you,
she has the day off.

05:38.233 --> 05:39.966
Max, that would be wonderful.

05:40.033 --> 05:41.733
Is there anything
I can do for you?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.066
No, but Regine can bite me.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.833
(Max)
Synclaire, would you calm down?

05:54.900 --> 05:58.900
I mean, how hard is it to play
the skeptic in an infomercial?

05:58.966 --> 06:00.940
Harder than it looks.

06:01.006 --> 06:04.506
"So much for so little.
It's impossible.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.673
That's crazy talk."

06:06.740 --> 06:08.573
You have to be very skeptical.

06:10.806 --> 06:15.340
Good morning, people.
I am Lanny Freedan.

06:15.406 --> 06:17.173
Thank you.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.873
You'll be auditioning for the
part of the skeptical co‐host

06:20.940 --> 06:24.573
in our segment
on the dashboard half plate.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.906
You'll be reading with a man
you might recognize

06:26.973 --> 06:29.240
as the star
of the lap‐top strudel maker

06:29.306 --> 06:33.140
and the bathtub pressure cooker,
Clive Nickelsby.

06:33.206 --> 06:35.840
Hello, hello, hello.

06:35.906 --> 06:38.806
I am what you call a Kiwi.
Now, who knows what that means?

06:38.873 --> 06:40.606
It means
you're from New Zealand

06:40.673 --> 06:42.140
and you are slowing us down.

06:42.206 --> 06:45.373
First up, Evan Bloom.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.840
Okay, good, good. At least I'm
not first, that's very unlucky.

06:48.906 --> 06:52.840
‐ Which part is lucky?
‐ Ah, damn if I know.

06:52.906 --> 06:54.806
"Evan, tell me,
have you ever been driving

06:54.873 --> 06:56.573
"to work in the morning
and thought to yourself

06:56.640 --> 06:59.840
'Blimey, I'd love
a grilled cheese sandwich?'"

06:59.906 --> 07:02.580
"The only possible answers
to your question are yes.

07:02.646 --> 07:04.580
"And you're darn tootin',
but we all know

07:04.646 --> 07:07.680
"enjoying that kind of
mouth‐watering snack in your car

07:07.746 --> 07:08.946
just isn't possible."

07:09.013 --> 07:10.946
Thank you.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.380
You're flat and lifeless,
but you have good hair.

Unless you're in labor,
shut the hell up.

I can't help it,
I'm nervous.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.846
I'm starting to imagine myself
getting that job.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.813
Well, good, good
that's a good thing.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.713
No, it's not
'cause I won't get the job

07:29.780 --> 07:32.913
and my face will never be on the
cover of "Jet Magazine," okay?

07:32.980 --> 07:34.146

Oh, no, no,
it happened again!

Kyle!

07:55.246 --> 07:56.780
This better be good money.

07:56.846 --> 07:58.413
Willis Scott just set
in a Miata

07:58.480 --> 08:00.853
and they had to bring in
the jaws of life.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.786
Well, I just had
another dream about TLC.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.386
This time we was
on a deserted island.

08:08.453 --> 08:10.353
Really?
What were they wearing?

08:10.420 --> 08:11.553
Sun block.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.353
Oh, nice.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.786
Look, uh, in the past,
I enjoyed a love dovey dream

08:16.853 --> 08:20.220
about a beautiful singing trio
with a upbeat, hip‐hop sound

08:20.286 --> 08:22.020
as much as the next man.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.653
But since I started
dating Synclaire

08:24.720 --> 08:26.853
I haven't had
erotic dreams about other women.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.053
I mean, why now?
You think something's wrong?

08:31.120 --> 08:34.153
Well, why ask me? Ask TLC.

08:37.785 --> 08:38.885

need to stop trippin'.

08:43.385 --> 08:45.686

we are every man's dream.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.786
Oh, hell, we get called over

08:57.853 --> 09:00.326
at Heavy D's house
three in four times a night

09:00.393 --> 09:01.960
and he's gonna love
his girlfriend more.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.393
Yo, you should listen
to the little one, huh.

09:13.193 --> 09:15.693
Oh, this is just
way too freaky.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.160
God help me.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.026
God's busy, what'd you want?

09:24.093 --> 09:28.193
Oh, I just had another
dream about TLC, dude.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.560
I mean, I'm beginning
to feel like

09:29.626 --> 09:31.193
I'm cheating on Synclaire now.

09:31.260 --> 09:32.660
Was Synclaire in the dream?

09:32.726 --> 09:33.726
No.

09:33.793 --> 09:35.726
Hey, then you're
getting away with it.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.326
Hey, wait a minute.
You was in the dream too.

09:42.393 --> 09:46.226

or the dream you?

09:48.526 --> 09:49.893
It's the real me.

your mind was bad and leave.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.793
Ooh, your mind is bad.

Next up, Synclaire James.

09:58.793 --> 10:00.433
Max, it's my turn.

Right, okay.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.933
Break a leg, knock 'em dead

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000

we could beat the rush hour.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.733
You're my rock, girl.

‐ B‐b‐but my look.
‐ Your look?

Clive looks like "Where's Waldo"
without the stupid hat.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.633
Go on, assert yourself.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.666
Assert myself? Can you see me
take a donut without asking?

10:38.733 --> 10:41.066
‐ I've asserted, let's just go.
‐ Mm. Mnm‐mnm.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.900
Alright, check this out,
rawhide.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.166
She's been sitting there
for six hours

10:48.233 --> 10:50.800
and she is not leaving until
you give her an audition.

10:50.866 --> 10:52.633
You cannot treat her the
same way they treated the cow

10:52.700 --> 10:54.633
before they made
your pants out of them.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.566
I'm sorry, but I can't give
your friend an audition.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.106
Didn't you hear
a word that I said?

11:02.173 --> 11:03.673
Loud and clear.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.673
That's why
I'm offering you the part.

11:06.840 --> 11:07.873
What?

11:07.940 --> 11:09.673
Yes, you have the vitality

11:09.740 --> 11:11.673
and utter believability
we're looking for.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.606
‐ Me?
‐ Her?

11:26.024 --> 11:27.576
Hey, y'all,
Synclaire home yet?

11:27.643 --> 11:28.743
No.

11:28.809 --> 11:29.776
Well, maybe she got the part

11:29.843 --> 11:31.843
and her and Max
went to celebrate.

11:31.909 --> 11:33.509
And maybe Newt Gingrich
will attend

11:33.576 --> 11:35.509
the next gay pride parade.

11:37.809 --> 11:39.309
‐ Thanks a lot, Max!
‐ Oh, come on.

11:39.376 --> 11:40.743
‐ Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
‐ Get off of this, Synclaire!

11:40.809 --> 11:43.143
Oh, you know,
why don't you take my man too?

11:43.209 --> 11:45.643
There he is, take him,
enjoy, take him.

11:47.543 --> 11:51.143
Hey, butter biscuit, this means
you didn't get the part, huh?

11:51.209 --> 11:53.476
No, I did not.

11:55.376 --> 11:56.943
What you do?

11:57.776 --> 11:59.176
Nothing.

11:59.243 --> 12:02.183
I just got the part, and this
free bathtub pressure cooker.

12:03.983 --> 12:06.249
How did that happen?
That's of $49 value.

12:07.816 --> 12:10.483
Look, all I did was
try to help Synclaire.

12:10.549 --> 12:11.849
The director offered me the role

12:11.916 --> 12:14.816
and suddenly, I saw my
footprints in cement, I..

12:18.283 --> 12:20.516
You stole the part
from Synclaire?

12:20.583 --> 12:22.383
She's already been rejected.

12:24.349 --> 12:26.649
And you know,
not so we forget, sweetheart.

12:26.716 --> 12:29.249
You know, I used my clout
to get you a part.

12:29.316 --> 12:33.483
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah,
I'm audience member number 28.

12:33.549 --> 12:37.016
I get to sit in the back row
yelling, "Hey, there now."

12:39.149 --> 12:41.849
Hey, Max, you could've been
a little more sensitive.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.049
I mean, acting is
Synclaire's thing.

12:44.116 --> 12:47.149
All you ever wanted to do
is be a supreme court justice

12:47.216 --> 12:48.616
and own a sizzler.

12:50.016 --> 12:53.583
And I will be on the bench,
and behind the grill.

12:53.649 --> 12:57.149
But tomorrow,
I'm gonna be on stage

12:57.216 --> 12:58.583
so if you'll excuse me

12:58.649 --> 13:00.789
I'm going home
to learn my lines.

13:02.789 --> 13:03.823
Then after that,
I'm gonna have

13:03.889 --> 13:07.956
a nice, long,
hot soak in the tub

13:08.023 --> 13:09.723
and some steamed cabbage.

13:11.089 --> 13:14.623
I'm going upstairs to rethink
my purpose on the planet.

13:14.689 --> 13:16.923
Oh, hey, sweetpea,
why don't you give me a minute

13:16.989 --> 13:19.656
to try to come up
with a bright side to this?

13:19.723 --> 13:22.189
Overton, thank you,
but I need to be alone.

13:24.523 --> 13:27.089
Yeah, well,
this is just as well.

13:27.156 --> 13:28.856
Coming up with a bright side
to this story

13:28.923 --> 13:31.023
is at least a 45 minute job.

13:32.256 --> 13:33.489
Wait a minute now.

13:33.556 --> 13:36.489
Wh‐why you got to come up
with a bright side on my couch?

13:38.323 --> 13:40.289
Look here, little short woman..

13:43.989 --> 13:47.256
...I'll be here all night
if that's what it takes

13:47.323 --> 13:50.056
to convince Synclaire
that I'm a loyal soul mate

13:50.123 --> 13:52.423
who wouldn't think about
looking at another woman

13:52.489 --> 13:54.256
in a million years.

13:54.323 --> 13:57.189
Unless of course, it was
totally beyond my control.

13:57.256 --> 13:59.556
I mean a, a man's gotta
get some sleep.

13:59.623 --> 14:01.896
I'm not a machine,
for the love of God!

14:04.296 --> 14:07.463
Well, now that
you've explained yourself

14:07.529 --> 14:09.696
sitting here
makes perfect sense.

14:10.829 --> 14:13.763
[music on TV]

14:31.529 --> 14:35.896
Overton, guess who.

14:40.363 --> 14:41.963
So that's where you're hiding?

14:42.029 --> 14:44.696
Oh, this is pure evil.

14:44.763 --> 14:46.396
I'm cheatin' on my sweetpea

14:46.463 --> 14:50.063
right under her cute little
sleepy droolin' face.

14:51.829 --> 14:52.796
You're not cheatin' on anybody.

14:52.863 --> 14:54.029
Let me tell you
what's happening.

14:54.096 --> 14:57.063
You see, you watch our videos,
you fall asleep.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.063
And then we show up
in your dreams.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.169
That's all.

15:00.236 --> 15:02.836
So you say, so, uh..

15:02.903 --> 15:06.736
So, ohh‐aa‐oh‐aa..

15:09.036 --> 15:12.536
So‐so what you're saying is
I watch your videos

15:12.603 --> 15:15.303
I fall asleep, and you show up
in my dreams?

15:15.369 --> 15:17.369
I think she just said that.

15:17.436 --> 15:20.636
Wait a minute, I wasn't watching
your videos tonight.

15:20.703 --> 15:25.203
‐ So, why are you here?
‐ Hah! This isn't your dream.

15:29.903 --> 15:32.569
‐ Hello!
‐ Hi, big papa!

15:32.636 --> 15:34.269
Yes!

15:34.336 --> 15:37.336
Kyle!
What am I doin' in your dream?

15:37.403 --> 15:40.136
I don't know. Must've been
something I ate. Mm.

15:41.736 --> 15:43.036
Ladies.

15:43.103 --> 15:45.169
Yes. Alright.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.936
Oh, by the way, Obie

15:47.003 --> 15:48.869
Synclaire is the luckiest woman
in the world.

15:48.936 --> 15:51.736
Oh, thank you, Left Eye.

15:51.803 --> 15:54.469
Hey, shorty, uh,
since this is your dream, uh

15:54.536 --> 15:56.203
you mind giving me something
a little better to do

15:56.269 --> 15:57.669
than just sittin' on this couch?

15:57.736 --> 16:00.743
Oh, not to worry, in a moment
a large fire breathing dragon

16:00.809 --> 16:02.043
will come out of that kitchen

16:02.109 --> 16:04.876
and chase you around
the apartment.

16:04.943 --> 16:06.443
So, now, ladies, talk to me.

16:06.509 --> 16:08.409
Waterfalls.
Why would one chase that?

16:12.143 --> 16:13.976
God, that was pathetic.

16:14.043 --> 16:16.843
Telling the guy in the tollbooth
I kidnapped you.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.676
Yeah, well, it took ten seconds
for me to convince him

16:19.743 --> 16:22.309
and ten minutes for you
to convince the policemen

16:22.376 --> 16:24.976
but I guess
you're the better actor.

16:27.709 --> 16:29.576
You know, I can't believe
that you're still in a funk.

16:29.643 --> 16:31.809
Yeah, Max, you're right.
I'm overreacting.

16:31.876 --> 16:36.076
In one fell swoop, you have
shaken my faith in my ability

16:36.143 --> 16:38.876
my training and our friendship.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.243
‐ Bear claw?
‐ No, thank you.

16:46.143 --> 16:48.843
Good morning, Maxine.

16:48.909 --> 16:51.643
Just follow Claus
and obey all of his gestures.

16:53.543 --> 16:57.276
Alright, people, let's get
this show on the road.

16:57.343 --> 17:00.043
I'm getting new chest hair
at 6:30.

17:00.109 --> 17:04.183
So for lack of a better word,
action.

17:04.249 --> 17:05.415
[instrumental music]

17:05.483 --> 17:06.983
[cheering]

17:11.549 --> 17:13.715
[laughing]

17:13.782 --> 17:18.049
Hey! Hello, and welcome
to "Breathtaking Inventions."

17:18.116 --> 17:19.683
I'm Shelia Innovato

17:19.749 --> 17:22.816
and here's our globetrotting
bargain finder

17:22.883 --> 17:25.049
Clive Nickelsby.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.083
Hello, hello, hello.

17:32.149 --> 17:33.349
Sheila, have you ever been

17:33.416 --> 17:35.016
driving to work
and thought to yourself

17:35.083 --> 17:37.316
"Blimey, I'd love
a mouth‐watering

17:37.383 --> 17:39.783
grilled cheese sandwich?"

17:39.849 --> 17:42.716
Well, the only possible answers
to your question are

17:42.783 --> 17:45.116
yes, and you're darn tootin'.

17:45.183 --> 17:48.583
But we all know that kind
of mouth‐watering snack

17:48.649 --> 17:52.549
in your car just isn't possible.

17:52.616 --> 17:57.249
Until now. And not just
mouth‐watering sandwiches.

17:57.316 --> 17:59.116
Bacon, flapjacks, fajitas.

17:59.183 --> 18:03.056
All thanks to today's
breathtaking invention.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.989
The dashboard hot plate.

18:05.056 --> 18:07.989
[cheering]

18:12.223 --> 18:16.256
Okay, it enhances the interior
of any vehicle

18:16.323 --> 18:19.656
but can it actually bring
the kitchen to your front seat?

18:19.723 --> 18:21.156
Don't take my word for it.

18:21.223 --> 18:23.623
Ask NFL All‐Pro, Cris Carter.

18:24.623 --> 18:27.689
Hey, I'm Cris Carter.

18:27.756 --> 18:29.623
As a wide receiver
for the Minnesota Vikings

18:29.689 --> 18:32.389
I get awfully hungry.

18:32.456 --> 18:35.723
See, that's why my dashboard
hot plate is always plugged in.

18:41.289 --> 18:42.889
See, nothing makes you forget

18:42.956 --> 18:45.656
double vision
or a separated shoulder

18:45.723 --> 18:48.789
like a mouthful of hot sandwich.

18:51.023 --> 18:52.956
[audience cheering]

18:59.489 --> 19:02.629
Well, if a wide receiver
loves the dashboard hot plate

19:02.696 --> 19:03.963
you know it's good.

19:05.163 --> 19:07.196
God, I'm getting out of here.
Excuse me.

19:07.263 --> 19:08.529
‐ You can stick‐‐
‐ Wait!

19:08.596 --> 19:10.463
‐ Huh?
‐ Seems we have a skeptic.

19:10.529 --> 19:12.229
'You, ma'am.'

19:12.296 --> 19:15.263
Why don't you come up here
on stage and judge for yourself?

19:15.329 --> 19:16.496
On stage?

19:16.563 --> 19:18.496
[cheering]

19:19.463 --> 19:20.563
[laughing]

19:20.629 --> 19:22.996
Sh‐Sheila, wouldn't you,
wouldn't you rather hear

19:23.063 --> 19:26.663
from America's favorite twins,
Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen?

19:26.729 --> 19:29.063
What's the matter, Clive,
are you afraid they taste nasty?

19:29.129 --> 19:30.963
Uh..

19:31.029 --> 19:34.329
But, uh,
but the unbelievable price.

19:34.396 --> 19:37.829
Hey, if the sandwich
doesn't taste good

19:37.896 --> 19:41.829
it's not worth the high impact
plastic that it's made out of.

19:45.796 --> 19:48.329
Mmm.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.763
Well, that's the most
mouth‐watering

19:49.829 --> 19:52.463
dashboard sandwich
I've ever tasted.

19:52.529 --> 19:55.696
[chuckles]
At first, I was skeptical

19:55.763 --> 19:59.163
but, Sheila, I'll take a dozen.
I don't care what they cost.

19:59.229 --> 20:01.303
They'll make a great
stocking stuffers.

20:01.369 --> 20:03.336
But I'm keeping this one
for myself.

20:06.803 --> 20:08.469
And cut!

20:09.969 --> 20:12.669
Lenny,
what the hell is going on?

20:12.736 --> 20:15.203
In 15 years
of directing infomercials

20:15.269 --> 20:18.736
that is the finest spontaneous
segment I have ever witnessed.

20:20.269 --> 20:22.803
But if you think about what
an infomercial is really

20:22.869 --> 20:24.903
how much room is there
for spontaneity?

20:24.969 --> 20:27.803
Precious little. You're fired.

20:27.869 --> 20:31.969
Yeah, well, at least I don't
have to buy my chest hair.

20:34.236 --> 20:35.369
Oh, you know what I mean.

20:35.436 --> 20:36.736
Come on, Max,
let's just, let's go.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.736
Yeah. Give us our checks
and we're out of here.

20:40.603 --> 20:43.303
Alright, people, take five.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.469
Thanks, Max.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.536
Because of you, this is
my first paycheck as an actor.

20:49.603 --> 20:50.769
Yeah, well, forget it.

20:50.836 --> 20:52.803
I was getting tired
of the gig anyway.

20:52.869 --> 20:54.969
Clive spits when he talks.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.303
You know I really felt good

20:56.369 --> 20:59.236
about my portrayal as the
skeptical audience member.

20:59.303 --> 21:00.609
I really knew her.

21:00.676 --> 21:04.576
Her passions for life,
her‐her desire for hot cheese.

21:05.976 --> 21:08.409
I left a little piece of myself
up there on those bleachers.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.576
I'm guessing
a fragment of brain.

21:12.609 --> 21:14.909
You are my rock, girl.
You're my rock.

21:19.076 --> 21:20.476
<i>(Regine)</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:24.476 --> 21:27.209
Anyway, I stopped watching
all those late night videos

21:27.276 --> 21:29.243
and haven't seen hide nor

21:29.309 --> 21:31.509
chart‐topping hair
of TLC ever since

21:31.576 --> 21:34.743
but I figured out just
wouldn't feel right about this

21:34.809 --> 21:37.109
until I told you.

21:37.176 --> 21:40.243
Oh, Overton, you're not
responsible for your dreams.

21:40.309 --> 21:42.209
My night school
psychology professor

21:42.276 --> 21:45.876
said that dreams are,
are largely symbolic anyway.

21:45.943 --> 21:47.676
So those three women could
represent

21:47.743 --> 21:50.409
the three blissful years that
we've spent together.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.309
Or the "Three Times A Lady"
in that old Lionel Richie song.

21:55.543 --> 21:58.476
Yeah, baby. I knew
you'd make sense out of this.

22:10.449 --> 22:13.083
Aah‐aah‐aah,
get your waterfall‐chasing

22:13.149 --> 22:15.583
asses up and out of here.

22:15.649 --> 22:20.283
Come on Frosty, T‐Bone, No‐Eye.
Go on, out.

<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
