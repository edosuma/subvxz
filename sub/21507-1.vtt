00:27.261 --> 00:29.194
No! No!

00:30.398 --> 00:32.197
- Mal!
- Wait! Wait!

00:32.198 --> 00:33.365
No!

00:36.170 --> 00:38.337
- No! No!
- Leave it. Leave it!

00:38.339 --> 00:40.272
- Come on!
- Wait! Wait!

00:40.274 --> 00:43.142
Listen, we have to go now!

00:43.144 --> 00:44.343
- Danny.
- Now!

00:44.345 --> 00:46.512
Oh, no!

00:46.514 --> 00:47.513
Don't!

00:47.515 --> 00:49.348
Leave this behind.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.150
No! No!

00:55.388 --> 00:57.256
We can beat them.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.590
Listen to me.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.726
Listen! Shh.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.827
Look at me.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.096
Hey...

01:04.098 --> 01:06.231
I'm not gonna lose You, too.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.633
Okay?

01:25.685 --> 01:28.220
We have to turn around.
We have to go back.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.621
- No.
- Frank, we have to go back.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.390
We can't leave him.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.458
Whatever's back there's not him.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.692
It's not Danny.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.495
- He's our son.
- Our son is gone!

01:39.866 --> 01:41.433
Mal!

03:53.266 --> 03:56.268
Can I help You?

03:56.270 --> 03:57.703
- Are You Mallory?
- Yeah.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.638
We're the coopers.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.240
You rent from us.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.243
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.877
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Sam.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.613
- This is Beth.
- Hi.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.015
And this is our famous
Cooper welcome basket.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.783
Oh, thank You.

04:11.785 --> 04:15.287
We just wanted to stop by
and make sure everything's okay.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.988
Yeah, no, everything is great.

04:16.991 --> 04:20.759
I love the... the furniture
and the decorations.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.729
Thank You.
I did it myself.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.497
I can tell.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.965
Here's our address
and our number,

04:26.967 --> 04:28.900
we're just up the road,
and so if You need anything

04:28.902 --> 04:30.535
just give a holler.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.376
Okay, well, I should...

04:37.378 --> 04:39.911
Yeah, You're totally
gonna catch a cold, so...

04:39.913 --> 04:41.046
Please.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.414
Nathan, let's go, buddy.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.016
Sorry, He's a roamer.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.484
Does this all the time.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.686
It's more annoying
than anything.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.021
Nathan!

04:53.593 --> 04:55.060
Hey.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.907
Hi, Nathan.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.410
Don't worry.
He's shy around girls.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.545
Yeah, Danny was, too.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.846
Was?

05:17.950 --> 05:20.852
He, um, He passed away
about a year ago.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.988
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.556
It's okay.
I'm fine now.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.437
Well, we should
probably get going.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.739
- Yeah.
- Yeah, if You need any other supplies,

05:40.741 --> 05:43.342
You know, t.P. Or batteries,
they're in the other cabin.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.509
There's lots of random
stuff in there.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.411
Got it.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.479
- Okay.
- Bye.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.481
- Come on, baby.
- Bye.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.413
You need a glass of water?

06:26.486 --> 06:28.787
Are You gonna wring me
a fresh glass from your shirt?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.430
Sure.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.097
Thanks.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.770
Who was at the door?

07:18.772 --> 07:24.042
If You came outside once in a
while You'd know, wouldn't You?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.911
I see trees.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.913
I see the lake.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.848
I see the leaves.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.551
I'd say I'm outside.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.921
Frank, this is not outside.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.457
It was the coopers.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.058
They were just coming
to check on us.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.227
Who?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.062
This is their place.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.230
We rent from them.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.199
They're kicking us out already?

07:47.201 --> 07:49.634
- No. -Two days some place
would have been a new record.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.169
We're not moving again.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.543
I have a good feeling.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.547
Let me in.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.877
I'm here. I'm here.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.748
There we go.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.217
You ever think about leaving?

10:52.219 --> 10:56.287
Again? We just got here.

10:56.289 --> 11:00.291
I mean, me, Mal.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.962
What is wrong with You today?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.096
I know You feel guilty.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.398
I do.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.067
And I blamed You,
but what's done is done

11:09.069 --> 11:11.436
and You can't do
anything about it.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.171
You got my permission
if You wanna leave

11:13.173 --> 11:15.373
and never come back.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.908
Find a new life.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.077
A new man.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.449
You're crazy, okay?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.785
Am I?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.820
Yes.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.823
If You were in that chair,
and I were You,

11:31.825 --> 11:34.459
I couldn't do it.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.727
I'd leave.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.929
Why are You doing this?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.831
- It hurts.
- I know.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.805
It hurts to look at You.

11:51.010 --> 11:55.980
So You're just...
You're just giving up on us?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.982
You've got a lot
of balls, frank.

11:57.984 --> 12:01.152
You're just gonna lie in here
and make decisions

12:01.154 --> 12:03.421
about my future,
without asking me?

12:03.423 --> 12:08.493
I can't take it back,
but I can make it right.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.829
Because You feel guilty.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.733
- Not because You want to.
- No, I'm doing what's right

12:14.735 --> 12:16.801
because I love You.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.272
Keep telling yourself that.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.310
Maybe one day You'll believe it.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.431
First I'm gonna chance,

12:46.433 --> 12:47.465
another month here.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.933
Another month there.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.869
And You can't let
these deadbeats

12:50.871 --> 12:52.937
talk You into anything.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.040
Remember, they all left.
You don't owe them.

12:56.042 --> 13:01.846
I'm... I'm sorry, Lucy.
I'm gonna have to let You go.

13:01.848 --> 13:05.984
It's not You, it's me.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.921
Frank? Is that You?

15:57.156 --> 15:59.524
Thirsty?

16:41.734 --> 16:44.135
Frank...

16:44.137 --> 16:46.270
Dance with me.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.413
Excuse me.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.582
- Hi.
- Sorry.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.518
We hate to bug You, but we were
wondering if maybe You've seen Nathan.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.187
No, I haven't, I'm sorry.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.855
Sometimes He plays by the water

18:10.857 --> 18:12.657
when no one's around,
but You guys are here

18:12.659 --> 18:14.225
so, it was a long shot.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.560
Have You checked
the small cabin?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.128
Yeah, He's not there.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.296
Well, we're just
gonna check around

18:18.298 --> 18:19.430
and then get out of your hair.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.300
Go right ahead.
It's your place.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.534
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.870
What are You doing?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.572
You're looking
a little bit pale.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.873
So?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.708
So, we're gonna go for a walk.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.178
No, we're not.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.781
Yes, we are.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.683
No.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.418
I'm not.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.494
Can we go back now?

19:56.496 --> 19:58.796
No, we can't go back now.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.543
How far are we going?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.545
Until my arms get tired.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.347
Besides, I thought
You liked the view.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.449
I did from the cabin.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.490
- Frank.
- Yeah?

20:26.492 --> 20:28.960
I think it's time
to go back now.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.795
Yeah.

20:33.298 --> 20:38.402
Oh, my god.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.571
It's the Cooper boy.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.739
Sweetheart!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.474
He's not breathing.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.575
Come on, Nathan, wake up.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.011
Come on. Oh, god.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.646
Come on.
Come on, baby.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.748
Come on.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.284
Come on.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.919
- Mal.
- Come on.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.523
It's too late.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.993
It's too late, Mal.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.715
We have to pack.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.651
And do what?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.621
Leave.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.491
How many times
do we keep doing this, frank?

21:33.493 --> 21:35.293
As long as we have to.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.696
We need to tell someone.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.964
No.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.999
Once was enough.
No more cops.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.835
I'll say that I found him by
myself, that You weren't with me.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.937
They'll look into
what happened with us.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.573
- With Danny. -It wasn't
your fault, frank.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.375
They don't care about the truth.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.044
They just want someone to blame.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.879
If somebody finds this kid

21:54.881 --> 21:56.981
You know they're gonna
pin it on me.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.951
No one's gonna find him.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.821
Mal, what are You doing?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.856
Guess how many places
we've been to, frank?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.958
Five.
This is five.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.929
I'm not gonna let it
become 10, 20, 100.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.597
It's done.

22:13.599 --> 22:16.701
We're not moving again.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.935
At least we're alive.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.105
This isn't a life anymore, okay?

22:24.576 --> 22:27.812
Nobody knows about this
until we figure it out.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.413
- All right?
- How?

22:29.415 --> 22:31.048
I will think of something.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.017
Let's go.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.720
Stop!

22:35.722 --> 22:38.589
We don't even know
what we're dealing with.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.425
Then help me, frank.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.761
Help me find out what this is.

22:45.597 --> 22:50.067
The answer's right there.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.069
We don't even know the question.

23:10.522 --> 23:11.989
I'm so sorry.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.586
Haunts me no more

23:42.588 --> 23:44.688
with Eleanor Perez.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.191
- Tonight's episode that goes...
- what are You watching?

23:47.193 --> 23:48.659
Snowman.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.086
Mallory Mcdowell?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.154
Yeah.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.457
- Officer Blodget.
- Hi.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.459
I wish I was here
under better circumstances.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.461
I'm actually looking
for a missing boy.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.162
His name is Nathan.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.997
Have You seen him?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.602
- No, I haven't...
- He's the Cooper's boy.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.871
- You rent from them.
- Oh, right, yeah.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.907
Um, yeah, He was here
a few days ago,

24:36.909 --> 24:39.009
um, but He was with them.

24:39.011 --> 24:42.179
But not since then?

24:42.181 --> 24:46.083
Truth be told, they need to keep a
shorter leash on this kid anyway.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.785
I'm sure He'll turn up.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.955
And if You do see Nathan,
please give me a call.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.490
- Okay, thank You.
- Thank You.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.662
What do You want from me?

25:31.664 --> 25:32.897
Haven't You done enough?

25:32.899 --> 25:35.232
You took my husband,
You took my son,

25:35.234 --> 25:38.536
You took my entire life!

25:38.538 --> 25:41.739
Fuck off!
Leave us alone!

25:41.741 --> 25:44.141
I am making it work here
and there is nothing

25:44.143 --> 25:46.844
that You can do about that.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.763
Hey.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.900
- Mal?
- Yeah?

28:22.902 --> 28:24.201
Fuck!

28:24.203 --> 28:26.737
Oh!

28:40.452 --> 28:43.120
You okay?

29:15.487 --> 29:18.088
Did You lock the door?

29:52.991 --> 29:54.525
I got You. I got You.

30:14.979 --> 30:19.550
What?

30:19.552 --> 30:22.886
I should be in
that chair, not You.

30:31.297 --> 30:34.264
Jesus, it's worse this time.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.905
Come here.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.319
Ready for a drive?

32:20.505 --> 32:22.372
So are You gonna tell me
where we're going?

32:22.374 --> 32:25.242
Nope.
It's a surprise.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.512
We're almost there.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.276
What can I get You, hon?

32:59.278 --> 33:02.312
- Eleanor.
- Why?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.281
She's my favorite.

33:11.422 --> 33:12.489
I'm starving.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.191
He was asking about You.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.592
- Okay. -I just thought
You should know.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.561
I'm gonna have
the veggie omelet.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.567
Hi. What can I get You?

33:23.569 --> 33:24.768
Eleanor.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.370
I'll come back
when You're ready.

33:26.372 --> 33:30.173
Hey, Eleanor, can
I get some more water?

33:30.175 --> 33:32.676
You were on that
ghost hunting show.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.644
Is that a fact or a question?

33:34.646 --> 33:36.613
Were You on
that ghost hunting show?

33:36.615 --> 33:38.115
Sorry, wrong girl.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.117
I've seen the show.
I know You're her.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.284
Are You going
to order something or what?

33:41.286 --> 33:42.753
No.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.588
Actually, we're here because
we have a few questions

33:44.590 --> 33:47.524
- we'd like to ask You.
- Yo, Eleanor! Water!

33:47.526 --> 33:52.195
Be right back.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.065
- So, this is your surprise.
- She was on a show.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.133
It was called,
"haunt me no more."

33:56.135 --> 33:57.300
Have You seen it?

33:57.302 --> 33:59.136
Yeah, a few clips last night.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.172
Jesus, frank,
those shows aren't real.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.540
How do You know?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.277
I just do.
Everyone knows.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.746
- You wanted my help.
- I know, but...

34:10.748 --> 34:14.384
Frank, she's an actor.

34:14.386 --> 34:18.422
Give her a chance.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.723
Okay, You ready?

34:19.725 --> 34:22.225
We're here because
we have a problem.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.395
Well, I hate to break it to You,
but we all have problems.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.264
You're an expert
in the paranormal.

34:31.268 --> 34:34.204
Can I have your attention now?

34:34.206 --> 34:35.639
We have the case of a lifetime.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.808
Footsteps when
there's no one there.

34:37.810 --> 34:40.444
Lights flickering
on and off by themselves.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.179
Things moving on their own.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.781
A door slammed into her.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.818
We deal with it every day,
no matter where we go.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.219
No matter what we do.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.587
No matter what house we live in,

34:50.589 --> 34:53.389
it follows us everywhere.

34:53.391 --> 34:56.525
If You still had your show,
we'd be on it.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.429
Okay.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.864
I was on that show.

35:00.866 --> 35:04.534
Okay? But reality TV
ain't real.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.337
It's all editing, sound effects.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.605
See? She's a fake.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.774
I didn't say I was fake.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.809
I said the show was fake.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.878
Will You help us?
We'll pay You.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.446
Are You here to make fun of me?

35:16.448 --> 35:17.681
You are wasting your time.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.250
We're not.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.285
We lost our son
from whatever's happening.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.621
Oh, the sympathy play, too.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.125
That's good.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.627
Got that chair for show as well?
It's pretty pathetic.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.865
Look, we're telling
the truth, okay?

35:34.867 --> 35:36.900
So, if You are
who He says You are,

35:36.902 --> 35:38.502
and You can do
what He says You can do,

35:38.504 --> 35:40.637
then maybe You can
really help us.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.339
Look, You folks seem nice, okay?

35:42.341 --> 35:43.874
I'd love to help...

35:43.876 --> 35:47.577
But actually, I don't believe
in that stuff anymore.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.279
That's nice, yeah.

35:49.281 --> 35:53.183
I mean, I don't wanna believe it
anymore either, right?

35:53.185 --> 35:55.585
I don't wanna believe
that my son is gone.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.421
I don't wanna believe
that something evil

35:58.423 --> 36:00.257
took over his soul,

36:00.259 --> 36:03.693
and left nothing
but an empty shell.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.364
All of these things happening
to us over and over

36:07.366 --> 36:09.232
following us from home to home.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.369
It all started
just before my son died.

36:16.841 --> 36:21.745
I will never forget
how black his eyes were.

36:23.381 --> 36:27.918
So, Eleanor, if that's
your name, it's real...

36:29.921 --> 36:32.789
Because I saw in my own son.

36:32.791 --> 36:37.861
And hey, it's okay if You
don't wanna believe it,

36:37.863 --> 36:39.930
'cause I don't wanna
believe it either.

36:44.735 --> 36:49.206
God, I swore
I was never going back.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.808
Okay...

36:51.810 --> 36:53.476
If I decide to help You,

36:53.478 --> 36:55.679
how do I know that You're
telling me the truth?

37:26.978 --> 37:29.412
- Hi.
- Come on in.

37:29.414 --> 37:32.582
You sure weren't kidding
about that drive.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.718
- Thanks for coming.
- Don't say anything.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.488
I need to do readings
without any influence.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.789
Hello, 1970.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.524
Hey, shows what You know.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.593
Digital stuff, good and cheap.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.761
You lose a lot.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.029
Things are either,
yes, You got it,

37:46.031 --> 37:47.397
or no, You didn't.

37:47.399 --> 37:50.300
This stuff lets me
catch the maybe.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.269
You sound like
a vinyl record freak.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.737
Are You sure You can help us?

37:53.739 --> 37:55.972
Well, like that show,
I don't make promises.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.675
And I need to see
what we're dealing with first.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.310
Just don't waste
our time, Eleanor,

38:00.312 --> 38:01.878
that's all that I ask.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.948
If there is something here,
it won't be here for long.

38:20.364 --> 38:21.831
Did anything happen today?

38:21.833 --> 38:25.969
- No.
- Yeah.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.737
What was it?

38:27.739 --> 38:29.739
Footsteps out back.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.641
Is there something
You're not telling me?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.943
No.

39:30.134 --> 39:31.801
Mmm!

39:34.138 --> 39:35.972
So, how long have You
been doing this?

39:35.974 --> 39:38.742
Oh! I've been eating
my whole life.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.477
You know what I mean.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.711
Ghost hunting.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.480
You know, paranormal
investigation.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.148
Privately, quite a while.

39:45.150 --> 39:48.885
And professionally I left
near the end of season one,

39:48.887 --> 39:52.455
'cause they were more interested
in ratings and not truth.

39:52.457 --> 39:55.058
I thought we were gonna
do some good, You know?

39:55.060 --> 39:56.926
Did You ever really get
to help anybody?

39:56.928 --> 39:58.962
Rarely.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.898
The producers exploited me
and made money doing it.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.501
They could care less
if I was real or not.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.169
If I could really help,
it didn't matter.

40:13.177 --> 40:16.980
So what makes us different?
Why come?

40:16.982 --> 40:18.915
I can see things
that are hidden.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.118
Objects, events, people.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.987
Sometimes I hear words
loud and clear

40:23.989 --> 40:26.189
tipping me off
something's happening.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.158
A few years ago my mother
was on a cruise,

40:28.160 --> 40:30.794
and I woke up in the middle
of the night hearing her voice

40:30.796 --> 40:32.796
say the word, "flood."

40:32.798 --> 40:35.031
And I called her to make sure
she was okay, You know,

40:35.033 --> 40:37.100
because she was on a ship
in the middle of the ocean.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.803
And everything was fine,
but then a few days later

40:39.805 --> 40:42.439
I went to her house
to feed her cats.

40:42.441 --> 40:45.875
And a water pipe had burst.

40:45.877 --> 40:49.846
There's no explanation
to how or why.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.648
That's a taste of what I can do.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.675
Do You hear that?

41:28.819 --> 41:31.621
So what does your story
have to do with us?

41:31.623 --> 41:36.259
I keep hearing one word over
and over ever since I met You.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.498
What word?

41:41.500 --> 41:43.233
Run.

41:48.272 --> 41:52.809
How long has He been like that?

41:52.811 --> 41:54.911
Since the car accident
about a year ago.

41:54.913 --> 41:58.548
No, I meant, I sense, like,
a different energy with him.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.216
Different from You or me.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.918
Good or bad?

42:01.920 --> 42:03.953
It's never that simple.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.221
Has He changed since then?

42:05.223 --> 42:07.290
Wouldn't You?

42:10.060 --> 42:12.028
Sorry.

42:14.732 --> 42:16.666
Do You feel guilty?

42:16.668 --> 42:17.967
What?

42:17.969 --> 42:20.537
That You're alive
and your son's dead?

42:20.539 --> 42:22.105
And You can walk
and frank can't?

42:22.107 --> 42:23.673
Well, yeah, when You
put it that way,

42:23.675 --> 42:28.278
yeah, I guess I do.
I feel pretty shitty.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.114
I lost my son.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.016
I nearly lost my husband.

42:33.018 --> 42:38.121
I am... I'm barely holding on
to anything that's normal.

42:39.590 --> 42:42.158
I'm scared.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.260
You should be.

42:44.262 --> 42:47.196
But I'm gonna help.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.768
Anyway, You're our first
house guest we've had

42:51.770 --> 42:54.571
since this all started.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.239
Well, I'm honored.

43:02.179 --> 43:06.983
The guilt will always
be there, You know.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.819
It never goes away.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.188
You just learn to live with it.

43:19.063 --> 43:24.233
I've never told anyone this,
but there was one episode

43:24.235 --> 43:27.003
that was never allowed to air.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.871
That was the reason I left.

44:23.927 --> 44:25.194
Here take this.

44:41.111 --> 44:42.945
What's inside here?

44:42.947 --> 44:45.014
I don't know.
We haven't looked yet.

45:38.368 --> 45:40.937
What the hell, Mallory?

45:40.939 --> 45:42.505
Sorry.

45:50.914 --> 45:52.348
It happened again.

45:52.350 --> 45:55.218
- At the storage cabin.
- Are You okay?

45:55.220 --> 45:58.321
Oh, yeah.
Grammar school stuff.

45:58.323 --> 46:01.491
- Right.
- Let the show begin.

46:01.493 --> 46:02.992
Our cameras are infrared.

46:02.994 --> 46:04.527
We'll have to wait
till dark to test them.

46:04.529 --> 46:06.295
Hit the lights.

46:11.068 --> 46:13.136
Are we gonna see
what's been following us?

46:13.138 --> 46:14.837
That's the plan.

46:19.409 --> 46:21.944
So, what now?

46:21.946 --> 46:23.513
Bedtime.

46:55.112 --> 46:57.547
Okay, so, it's
usually run of the mill stuff.

46:57.549 --> 47:00.116
Weird noises, flickering lights,

47:00.118 --> 47:01.450
moving furniture.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.052
Creepy, but not dangerous,
right?

47:03.054 --> 47:04.453
I mean, define dangerous.

47:04.455 --> 47:05.955
Well, except for the activity
following You

47:05.957 --> 47:08.024
when You move
from house to house.

47:08.026 --> 47:09.826
I don't think I've ever
seen that before.

47:09.828 --> 47:12.128
I'd say all that takes us out
of run-of-the-mill status.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.229
Yeah, maybe.

47:13.231 --> 47:14.964
How bad does it have to be?

47:14.966 --> 47:16.599
- You don't wanna know.
- Okay.

47:24.174 --> 47:26.475
It just happened so fast.

47:28.445 --> 47:30.313
He, um...

47:32.950 --> 47:35.518
He started bleeding
out of his eyes.

47:36.620 --> 47:38.988
And then out of his nose.

47:38.990 --> 47:41.524
And I called for an ambulance,
but they took forever.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.863
And then He stopped breathing.

47:46.865 --> 47:51.968
He just collapsed.
Fell over.

47:55.539 --> 48:00.376
He made noises I have never
heard come from a person before.

48:02.145 --> 48:03.946
And then He died.

48:05.549 --> 48:08.351
They blamed frank,

48:08.353 --> 48:10.152
and they said
that He shook him too hard

48:10.154 --> 48:12.021
and that Danny's
little heart gave out.

48:12.023 --> 48:15.057
But frank would never ever.

48:15.059 --> 48:18.027
You said before
that Danny's eyes went black.

48:18.029 --> 48:19.428
When was that?

48:19.430 --> 48:21.631
When He stood back up.

48:25.202 --> 48:26.969
And attacked me.

49:23.293 --> 49:25.261
Shh.

50:22.587 --> 50:26.622
Just close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.132
Don't move.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.607
Mallory!

50:44.609 --> 50:46.042
- Go!
- Mallory!

50:46.044 --> 50:48.077
Mallory! Mallory!

50:48.079 --> 50:50.746
Be careful!
You're okay.

51:14.337 --> 51:16.405
What? What?

51:36.193 --> 51:38.394
Oh, my god!

52:29.246 --> 52:30.513
Need any help?

52:30.515 --> 52:32.681
Things would have been
so much easier

52:32.683 --> 52:34.450
if You two would have
told me everything.

52:34.452 --> 52:36.152
You think what happened
last night was bad?

52:36.154 --> 52:38.320
You have no idea what's coming,

52:38.322 --> 52:41.357
and I am not going
to stick around and wait for it.

52:41.359 --> 52:44.527
I killed Danny.

52:44.529 --> 52:48.564
Mallory doesn't know.

52:48.566 --> 52:52.301
She went into his room
to check on him.

52:52.303 --> 52:56.272
And He attacked her.

52:56.274 --> 52:59.608
She ran out of the room
for my help.

52:59.610 --> 53:04.313
And I looked around...

53:04.315 --> 53:08.417
And I strangled him.

53:08.419 --> 53:11.787
Until He stopped breathing.

53:11.789 --> 53:15.958
I did it so that whatever
was turning his eyes black

53:15.960 --> 53:17.927
could never do it again.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.930
So that's it.

53:20.932 --> 53:22.464
These things need something

53:22.466 --> 53:24.733
to help them manipulate
our world.

53:24.735 --> 53:26.535
Sometimes it's heat,

53:26.537 --> 53:28.504
so You get sudden
pockets of cold.

53:28.506 --> 53:31.774
And sometimes it's electricity
so You get manifestations

53:31.776 --> 53:32.908
of thunder and lightning,

53:32.910 --> 53:35.244
and...

53:35.246 --> 53:39.281
Sometimes...
Sometimes it's emotions.

53:39.283 --> 53:40.916
Strong ones.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.618
Like ours.

53:42.620 --> 53:46.689
What happened to me last night
was because of You both.

53:46.691 --> 53:50.459
Your spirit feels guilty.

53:50.461 --> 53:54.396
And You've wound Mallory up
so tight she's about to pop.

53:54.398 --> 53:58.601
Powerful stuff
from the both of You.

53:58.603 --> 54:00.669
You two are quite the feast.

54:03.006 --> 54:06.475
I need You to stay...

54:06.477 --> 54:08.277
For Mallory.

54:17.721 --> 54:19.655
Hey, where You going?

54:23.260 --> 54:25.361
There's something out there.

54:39.276 --> 54:42.311
- Do You ever come out here?
- No.

54:46.583 --> 54:49.451
Well I mean, sometimes, I guess.

55:06.503 --> 55:08.404
Which way do You usually go?

55:08.406 --> 55:09.805
That way.

55:34.731 --> 55:36.332
Fuck off.

55:44.574 --> 55:45.841
Oh!

56:04.994 --> 56:08.430
- Something wrong?
- No.

56:08.432 --> 56:10.132
There's some high level
activity here.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.771
I'm with Mallory Mcdowell
at the clearing

56:15.773 --> 56:17.973
about a mile away
from the main cabin

56:17.975 --> 56:20.976
down the left side of the fork.

56:20.978 --> 56:22.911
Say something.

56:22.913 --> 56:24.513
Um, hello.

56:36.493 --> 56:38.127
Is there something
You're not telling me?

56:42.465 --> 56:45.834
- No. -I think You forget
who You're talking to.

56:45.836 --> 56:47.503
Someone was here.

56:53.943 --> 56:56.812
There was a little boy here
the other day.

56:56.814 --> 56:58.814
I didn't know what to do.

56:58.816 --> 57:02.084
I tried to save him,
but He was already dead.

57:02.086 --> 57:05.888
And we couldn't tell anybody.
I have to protect frank.

57:05.890 --> 57:07.823
Find yourself
somebody else to help You.

57:12.061 --> 57:13.929
Do You feel that?

57:37.854 --> 57:41.523
We have to go!
We have to go! Come on!

57:41.525 --> 57:43.926
Don't look at it!

57:56.873 --> 57:58.874
Come on!
We gotta go!

57:58.876 --> 58:00.642
Come on! Let's go!

58:00.644 --> 58:02.478
Don't stop!

58:05.515 --> 58:07.049
Frank!

58:12.957 --> 58:15.023
Come on! this way!

58:35.712 --> 58:38.046
Oh, my god.
I am so, so sorry.

58:38.048 --> 58:39.615
I don't know what to do anymore.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.016
I don't.

58:41.018 --> 58:44.987
I can't figure it out.
I've tried everything.

58:44.989 --> 58:46.655
I need your help.

58:46.657 --> 58:48.824
Please! Please!

58:54.130 --> 58:57.165
- What was that?
- I don't know.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.535
Usually they're just
residual haunts

58:59.537 --> 59:01.737
like a strong memory
played back over and over.

59:01.739 --> 59:03.205
It's usually totally
harmless stuff.

59:03.207 --> 59:05.007
Yeah, I'd take one of those
any day of the week.

59:05.009 --> 59:08.977
I mean, in my experience
they just need closure

59:08.979 --> 59:10.746
or, like, an extra push
to move on.

59:10.748 --> 59:12.548
To where?

59:13.550 --> 59:15.918
- To where?
- I don't know.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.886
I've never had anything
physically manifest

59:17.888 --> 59:20.122
- or harm people.
- Okay, all right,

59:20.124 --> 59:22.157
so maybe we can just push them
on ourselves, right?

59:22.159 --> 59:24.092
Okay, we could
just send them away.

59:24.094 --> 59:25.827
- I...
- You don't know.

59:25.829 --> 59:27.062
So now what?

59:27.064 --> 59:28.597
Well, we need to go find
my work order.

59:28.599 --> 59:29.965
And we need to look
for that boy.

59:29.967 --> 59:31.166
I was afraid
You were gonna say that.

59:31.168 --> 59:32.801
Look, I really
think that we need

59:32.803 --> 59:35.203
to just take
a minute to dry off here.

59:35.205 --> 59:38.006
Okay?

59:38.008 --> 59:40.609
The lake.

59:40.611 --> 59:42.644
What about it?

59:42.646 --> 59:45.681
When we were running
towards the lake,

59:45.683 --> 59:48.283
I kept hearing
the word "water."

59:48.285 --> 59:50.085
You mean like one
of your feelings?

59:51.888 --> 59:54.623
The lake disrupted
whatever was following us.

59:54.625 --> 59:58.093
If I could...

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.729
If I can just figure it out.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.937
I'm with Melany Mcdowell
at the clearing

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.673
about a mile away
from the main cabin

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:14.743
down the left side of the fork.

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:16.378
Say something.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.914
Um, hello.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.750
Mommy.

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:44.906
Mallory, is that your son's?

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:46.208
Yeah.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:49.077
Do You have any
of his other things here?

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:50.912
- No.
- Just this?

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.814
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.989
Hold it up.

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:08.864
His spirit might be attracted
to the thing You save.

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.400
- Really? -No, that's not
necessarily a good thing.

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:14.036
It's possible that Danny
needs help moving on,

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:17.205
and his spirit is reaching out.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:20.442
But, I mean, Danny
would never hurt us.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:22.911
No, no, it's not intentional.

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:26.448
He's lost. He's confused.
And sometimes they lash out.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.883
Just like people.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:30.352
I mean He did have
some tantrums.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.421
Exactly. So we're gonna
have a small ceremony

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:34.022
to help your son cross over.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.324
We're gonna burn this
in a cleansing fire,

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.827
- and then we scatter the ashes.
- No.

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:40.762
Once there's a connection
to the other world,

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:42.864
it's easier to open
the door again,

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.701
and other things
can come through, too.

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:47.002
What do You mean,
"other things"?

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.171
Burning it, Mallory,
is the only way

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.406
to help him through
and close that door.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.974
- Sorry, I'm leaving.
- I need to do this now.

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:54.309
- No, I'm sorry.
- Give it to me.

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:56.411
You don't understand
what I've been through.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.217
Okay.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.486
What about the missing boy?

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:06.888
Huh? Did You come
into contact with him

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.058
- before He died?
- Um...

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.993
Yeah, I mean, He...
He was here a few days ago.

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:13.428
Well, why didn't
You tell me that?

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.731
This is his parents' house.
We rent from them.

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.833
Well, I didn't know that.

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:19.334
Do You have anything
of his here?

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:21.436
Did... maybe He left
something behind?

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:23.371
I don't know.
I don't think so.

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:25.774
Well, we need to get in touch
with his parents right now.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.978
I have their phone number.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.835
They're still not answering.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.915
Hello?

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.321
Hello?

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.993
Mr. Cooper?

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.231
Mrs. Cooper?

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.413
Mr. Cooper?

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.652
Mrs. Cooper?

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.970
Oh, god!

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:43.972
Oh, my god!

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.077
Oh, my!

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.048
Oh, my god!

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.418
- Ahh!
- Shh, shh.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.585
Mallory, Mallory,
look at me, look at me.

01:05:57.587 --> 01:05:59.020
What?

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:00.956
- Was that the missing boy?
- Yes.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:01.957
Okay, it's okay.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.658
Let's go.
Let's go!

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.527
Say something.

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.395
Um, hello.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:12.667
Mommy.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:15.503
And this is the footage
that I captured last night.

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:17.739
It's kinda hard to make out,

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:20.642
but there's something
right there.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.014
And then there's this.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.423
It's pushing through.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:36.458
What is?

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.593
Something big.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.228
I reviewed my entries
noting the time

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:41.629
of all the incidences
since I got here.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.331
The intervals
are getting shorter,

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.166
it's getting closer.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.701
And now with the coopers,
whatever it is,

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:48.670
it's spreading out.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.239
At this point, I think we only
have a question of hours left.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.343
Before what?

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.078
I'd rather not find out.

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:26.775
Guardians, I call upon You now.

01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:30.211
We ask that You keep
watch over us tonight.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.380
Let all who enter
under your guidance

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:36.251
do so in perfect love
and perfect trust.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:40.288
Danny Mcdowell, we seek You.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.824
Your mother and father
are here for You.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.828
Please honor us
with your presence.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.423
- He's here.
- Where?

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.658
No, not physically,
but He's around.

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:18.693
Can He hear me?

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.728
Say something to him.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:26.501
Sweetheart, it's mommy.

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.240
I love You so much,

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:38.279
and I think about You every day,

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.182
every minute, and every second.

01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:44.385
He hears You.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.886
He's happy.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:51.859
I can feel his love for You.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.595
You both.

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:01.435
Hey, buddy.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:06.640
I just wanna say how...
I don't know what to say.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.309
Just talk to him.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:14.215
I hope You're in
a better place now.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:17.585
No more fear and pain.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:21.156
And all You remember
are the happy times,

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.457
'cause that's all
I try to remember.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.196
I miss You, Danny.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.398
And I'm sorry.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.169
I'm so sorry.

01:09:35.203 --> 01:09:37.604
He understands.

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:43.912
Danny Mcdowell,

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.613
we release You from the bonds

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.349
that keep You from the light.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.218
Go with love.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.795
He doesn't wanna leave.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.733
Danny, it's okay.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:08.336
It's okay. Go.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:10.205
He's afraid.

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:12.473
Sweetheart, don't be afraid.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.311
No, He's not afraid for himself,

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:19.547
He's afraid for You.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.707
He's gone.

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:51.412
He's gone.

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.952
- Thank You.
- For what?

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:35.456
I'd pretty much given up,
as much as I didn't want to.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.326
And helping You
has made me realize

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:41.362
that I'm ready to jump back in

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:45.633
and help others.
People need me.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.468
I can't hide from that.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.539
Thank You.

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.011
Thank You.

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.719
You got room for one more?

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:51.766
I think we're gonna need
a bigger bed.

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:53.101
Nah.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.126
It's okay.

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:21.662
Okay.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:15.676
Sending Danny away
was a mistake.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.714
He was protecting You
from something.

01:15:19.716 --> 01:15:22.016
It is dangerous to stay.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:26.187
No more running.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.855
I'm done.

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.626
This ends tonight.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:38.533
I know it's a lot to ask for.

01:15:38.535 --> 01:15:41.536
And I understand
if You want to go,

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:44.272
but, Eleanor, please help us.

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:47.975
I can't promise
safety for any of us.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:51.312
- We're not asking You to.
- Tell us what to do.

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:57.018
If it's still here,
the focus must be on one of You.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.620
So one of us is possessed?

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:03.624
You're not.
It likes one of You.

01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:05.893
We just gotta
figure out which one.

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:28.783
Close your eyes.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:30.952
I summon forth the inner light

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:34.655
to rid myself the soul of fight.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:37.358
I summon forth the inner light

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.095
to rid myself the soul of fight.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.164
Say it with me.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:46.167
I summon forth the inner light

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:49.637
to rid myself the soul of fight.

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:52.640
I summon forth the inner light

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:54.775
to rid my...

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:01.349
Eleanor... are You okay?

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:53.367
Help me please.

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:57.905
Help me please.

01:17:57.907 --> 01:18:00.708
Help me please.

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:03.144
Help me!

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.447
Oh, my lord.

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:08.883
Oh, my god.
Are You okay?

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:13.320
Are You okay?

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.924
I knew it.

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:20.895
Oh, I called it.
Oh, that's quick.

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:25.332
Frank, give me your hand.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.818
Frank.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.453
Oh, my god.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.281
Frank.

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:20.054
Oh, my god.
Eleanor.

01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:22.189
Eleanor, are You okay?

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:23.758
Are You okay?

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.875
Frank?

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.816
Frank.

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:04.431
Frank?

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:03.157
Frank?

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.067
Frank?

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.905
Frank! Frank! No!

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.531
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:51.538
Frank.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.340
No.

01:21:53.342 --> 01:21:55.643
Come back.
Come back, please.

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:58.112
Come back.
Come back.

01:22:00.016 --> 01:22:02.182
Please stop now!

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:03.550
No!

01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:06.186
No!

01:22:08.224 --> 01:22:09.423
Help me.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.658
Frank?

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.226
- Mal.
- Frank?

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:14.395
- What's up?
- Frank, shh.

01:22:14.397 --> 01:22:16.463
- I can't swallow it.
- Shh.

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:22.102
What's...

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.204
- I need You to do something.
- What?

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:26.607
Get rid of it,

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.042
while we have it.

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:29.510
How?

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.285
No.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.421
- No, I won't.
- You have to.

01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:43.324
- We need to get You to
the water, okay? -Why?

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:45.492
Because whatever it is,
it doesn't like the water.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:50.130
I don't know why.
So here, just hold on.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.366
Frank! No, no.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:55.169
No! No! No! No! Frank!

01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:58.605
Frank! Frank!

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:00.207
Just stop! Stop! Stop!

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:03.711
Now, I need You
to hold the fuck on.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:08.549
No! No!

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.634
Okay! Okay!

01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:10.077
Mal.

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:19.586
Mal, what are You doing?

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.123
Don't worry, sweetheart.

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:28.095
You're not gonna feel a thing.

01:25:20.683 --> 01:25:23.150
We got You.
We got You.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.568
Mal!

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:42.836
- Mal?
- I'm right here!

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:45.339
Come here!
Come here! Come here!

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:47.508
No, come here!
Come here!

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:49.343
What now?

01:25:49.345 --> 01:25:51.745
No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:51.747 --> 01:25:52.913
You have to let go.

01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:56.750
I'm not letting You go.
Okay? Okay?

01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:59.520
Love You.

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:02.656
I got You. It's okay.
No! No!

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:07.494
No!

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.530
I got You.
Come on.

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:10.864
- Mal.
- Come on!

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:12.366
Here... here we go!

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:14.601
It's okay, it's okay.

01:26:14.603 --> 01:26:17.638
- I'm not leaving here without You, okay?
- I have to see You do it.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.240
- No, no, I can't. -It's
the only way I know, so...

01:26:20.242 --> 01:26:24.511
I'm not gonna do it.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:25.913
Frank?

01:26:25.915 --> 01:26:27.948
No! No, frank!

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.850
No! No..., please.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.718
Please, please.
You have to come.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.755
You have to stay with me.
You have to stay here.
