WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:04.689
Ruined.
Completely...

00:04.930 --> 00:05.738
Mother, come on,
we're not...

00:05.865 --> 00:07.462
Shut up.
And utterly...

00:07.599 --> 00:09.599
- We're not...
- Shut up. And ruined!

00:09.601 --> 00:11.186
We're not "ruined,"
Camille.

00:11.308 --> 00:13.291
We've got 2,000 pounds
of cocaine.

00:13.293 --> 00:15.293
Minus the 20 kilos
you sold for Monopoly money, oh,

00:15.295 --> 00:18.346
minus however much Pam ate,
probably two kilos.

00:18.348 --> 00:21.266
- Or three, or whatever.
- Quit eating all the

00:21.268 --> 00:25.387
- goddamn cocaine!
- Make me!

00:25.920 --> 00:28.854
My point, unless Pam

00:28.856 --> 00:31.607
ate it, is that things could be
a lot worse.

00:31.609 --> 00:33.692
How?
You sold a million dollars of

00:33.694 --> 00:35.861
product for this worthless stack
of paper.

00:35.863 --> 00:37.789
How could it be any worse?

00:40.868 --> 00:43.902
I, uh, hate to agree
with Archer, but it could be

00:43.904 --> 00:45.904
worse-- these are actually
really good fakes.

00:45.906 --> 00:47.906
I mean, not good enough to
deposit in a bank, but...

00:47.908 --> 00:50.776
Good enough to pass
in, say, a deli?

00:50.778 --> 00:52.978
- Yeah, I guess, but...
- Shut up.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.697
So you take a hundred,
go buy a pack of gum, and walk

00:55.699 --> 00:58.751
- out with $99.50 in change.
- Hey, that's brilliant,

00:58.753 --> 01:00.719
- Archer.
- Yeah, plus gum?

01:00.721 --> 01:03.756
So you're gonna do
that 10,000 times?

01:03.758 --> 01:05.758
Well, not me
personally.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.594
Not anyone
personally; it's idiotic.

01:08.596 --> 01:11.563
What we need is a big-ticket
item.

01:11.565 --> 01:13.565
Like a big bag
of cocaine!

01:13.567 --> 01:15.567
The last thing we need
is more cocaine.

01:15.569 --> 01:17.569
- Disagree.
- Because you are

01:17.571 --> 01:19.571
- addicted to cocaine.
- Your words.

01:19.573 --> 01:21.640
Hey, wait a second,
I've got the perfect big-ticket

01:21.642 --> 01:23.692
item-- Cadillacs!
- Nope.

01:23.694 --> 01:25.711
- Let me finish.
- Oh, I'm sorry, please,

01:25.713 --> 01:27.880
uh, skip ahead to the part where
I'm out 50 Caddies with your

01:27.882 --> 01:30.849
counterfeit money in the one
hand and my schlong in

01:30.851 --> 01:32.851
- the other.
- Well, not now.

01:32.853 --> 01:34.853
- You ruined it.
- The mental image

01:34.855 --> 01:36.855
- alone.
- And besides, what

01:36.857 --> 01:38.857
were you planning to do with
50 Cadillacs?

01:38.859 --> 01:40.859
Um, open a
dealership?

01:40.861 --> 01:43.796
- What? Ron's done very well.
- Speaking of,

01:43.798 --> 01:45.881
- why aren't you at work?
- Everything's on

01:45.883 --> 01:47.916
autopilot.
There's nothing for me to do.

01:47.918 --> 01:50.836
- I am so bored.
- Have you tried cocaine?

01:50.838 --> 01:53.722
No, no, nah.
Smoked a reefer cigarette once.

01:53.724 --> 01:55.841
Uh, let me guess, with
some Negroes?

01:55.843 --> 01:58.594
- As luck would have it.
- What about guns?

01:58.596 --> 02:00.712
No, no, they seemed
nice, jazz cats.

02:00.714 --> 02:02.815
No, why don't we buy
guns?

02:02.817 --> 02:05.684
I mean, I assume rival drug
dealers aren't gonna be too

02:05.686 --> 02:07.736
- happy with us...
- And since the FBI

02:07.738 --> 02:10.656
seized all the ISIS weapons when
they took the building.

02:10.657 --> 02:12.724
Oh, my God.
All we have now is my Walther

02:12.726 --> 02:15.577
- and what, Lana, your TEC-9's?
- Yeah, for which I have

02:15.579 --> 02:17.613
- no ammo.
- What?

02:17.615 --> 02:19.615
I used to get it from
work.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.633
Okay, if we're doing
a list?

02:21.635 --> 02:23.619
- Bullets.
- Oh for... Sterling,

02:23.621 --> 02:25.904
Lana, go through the old ISIS
files and find an arms dealer.

02:25.906 --> 02:30.676
Cyril, go lock up the product
before Cokie Monster here

02:30.678 --> 02:32.744
gobbles it all up, and Ron, take
me to lunch.

02:32.746 --> 02:34.746
It's 8:30 in
the morning.

02:34.748 --> 02:36.748
A bar, then!
Whatever!

02:36.750 --> 02:39.584
Ooh, or maybe a jazz club.
We can smoke reefers with these

02:39.586 --> 02:41.687
Negroes you're suddenly so nuts
about.

02:41.689 --> 02:43.956
- It was 1940!
- And where am I supposed

02:43.958 --> 02:46.592
to lock up 2,000 pounds
of cocaine?

02:46.594 --> 02:48.760
Cyril, look around.
Somewhere in this mansion, I

02:48.762 --> 02:54.599
have to assume, is a gigantic,
Scrooge McDuckian vault.

02:54.601 --> 02:59.872
Scrooge McDuck, eh?

02:59.874 --> 03:03.761
Sweater.

03:41.951 --> 03:43.435
All right.
Where are we?

03:44.023 --> 03:46.023
Lana, did you find an
arms dealer?

03:46.025 --> 03:48.960
Mmm, no, all we've got
so far is Spyridon Skorpio

03:48.962 --> 03:51.028
- and Conway Stern.
- Geez, those are old

03:51.030 --> 03:52.947
- files.
- One of whom we blew

03:52.949 --> 03:55.116
up, the other of whom's hand we
gruesomely ripped off.

03:55.118 --> 03:58.169
And both of whom
bring up extremely uncomfortable

03:58.171 --> 04:02.039
sexual memories for...
uh, 40% to 60% of the people in

04:02.041 --> 04:04.041
- this room.
- Hmph.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.844
Oh, what about Ray's brother,
the pot farmer?

04:06.846 --> 04:08.829
- He had lots of guns.
- Yeah, he's doing life

04:08.831 --> 04:11.215
- in prison.
- Now, that's the song

04:11.217 --> 04:14.151
- you should write.
- Ugh, or maybe

04:14.153 --> 04:17.021
one about a crippled cyborg, who
all he did was pussy-ache about

04:17.023 --> 04:21.192
being a crippled cyborg!

04:21.194 --> 04:23.995
Well, keep looking.
And, Cyril, you've got the

04:23.997 --> 04:26.063
- product under lock and key?
- Yup, in the kitchen

04:26.065 --> 04:28.065
pantry.
There's no Scrooge McDucky

04:28.067 --> 04:30.067
- vault.
- No what?

04:30.069 --> 04:32.069
Uh, how about an
old-timey gymnasium full of

04:32.071 --> 04:35.873
- Indian clubs and medicine balls?
- Hello?

04:35.875 --> 04:39.076
- I've finished!
- There is one of those.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.078
Oh, and it was a good
idea to lock up all the

04:41.080 --> 04:43.080
- counterfeit money.
- Yeah, good job,

04:43.082 --> 04:45.082
- whoever did that.
- Wait, did you not?

04:45.084 --> 04:47.084
- Mmm, no, I...
- What?

04:47.086 --> 04:50.021
- Well, where the hell is it?
- Welp!

04:50.023 --> 04:52.123
I've got good news and good
news.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.126
- Amphetamines?!
- Right?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.095
And I know it sounds crazy, but
I like them as much as cocaine.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.965
Where did you get
them?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.967
Okay, okay, okay, so
remember how I used to

05:02.969 --> 05:04.969
- drift-race with the Yakuza?
- The Yakuza?

05:04.971 --> 05:07.004
<i>- Hai.</i>
<i>- What, were the</i>

05:07.006 --> 05:09.974
<i>- Hells Angels busy?</i>
<i>- Busy being pussies.</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:12.860
<i>You know, relatively.</i>
<i>When compared to the deadly and</i>

05:12.862 --> 05:14.979
<i>- terrible Yakuza.</i>
<i>- Yeah, and on a</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:17.098
<i>related note, Pam, what do you</i>
<i>think's gonna happen when they</i>

05:17.100 --> 05:19.100
<i>realize the money is</i>
<i>counterfeit?</i>

05:19.102 --> 05:22.853
<i>Oh, my God, right?</i>
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

05:22.855 --> 05:24.989
<i>- Yes, Pam, we can.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God, they chop</i>

05:24.991 --> 05:27.158
<i>- off their own</i> fingers.
- Do they know how to

05:27.160 --> 05:30.861
- find you?
- Um...

05:30.863 --> 05:35.132
Well, they know I work at ISIS,
but that won't do them any good.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.968
- Well, thank...
- Although...

05:37.970 --> 05:42.006
Whooooo!
<i>Domo arigato,</i> fellas.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.009
Two of them have been
to my apartment.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.245
You, too, Ojiisan.
Or three, or whatever.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.231
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can the mind vomit?

05:50.233 --> 05:52.233
But now I live here,
so...

05:52.235 --> 05:54.185
Well, thank God,
the...

05:54.187 --> 05:59.190
- Although...
- Hmm?

05:59.192 --> 06:02.893
Hmm.
Hmm-hmm.

06:02.895 --> 06:06.764
Mmm, mm-hmm.

06:07.901 --> 06:21.240
_

06:21.360 --> 06:25.583
Ugh, yes, the mind
can, in fact, vomit.

06:30.131 --> 06:33.958
I'm not here.

06:39.275 --> 06:42.109
Oh, dear God.

06:42.349 --> 06:45.350
Telephone clanging away, and me
trapped.

06:45.352 --> 06:47.485
It's a good servant's worst
nightmare.

06:47.487 --> 06:50.554
I don't know how this could
possibly be any wor...

06:50.556 --> 06:54.359
Oh.

06:54.361 --> 06:57.362
Hey, so, did
somebody order Chinese?

06:57.364 --> 06:59.247
They're Japanese,
you idiot!

06:59.249 --> 07:01.249
Oh, for... I don't

07:01.251 --> 07:03.251
get all pissy every time
you mistake a Dutchman

07:03.253 --> 07:05.570
for a Swede!
Either time that happened!

07:05.572 --> 07:08.256
Answer the

07:08.258 --> 07:10.341
- goddamn telephone!
- Now, there's

07:10.343 --> 07:11.676
- your song!
- No!

07:11.678 --> 07:13.511
- Answer it!
- Make me!

07:13.513 --> 07:16.230
- Holy shitsnacks.
- I will break both of

07:16.232 --> 07:18.232
your collarbones, and then pull
them out of your body,

07:18.234 --> 07:21.235
and then use them to play,
in its entirety and on your

07:21.237 --> 07:23.521
head, "Moby Dick."
Bonham's a pussy.

07:23.523 --> 07:26.240
- Maybe you pussy!
- Pam?

07:26.242 --> 07:29.410
Hello?

07:29.412 --> 07:32.463
<i>- Shiro kabocha.</i>
<i>- It's Mr. Moto!</i>

07:32.465 --> 07:36.334
<i>Shiro kabocha,</i>
<i>I am very ashamed...</i>

07:36.336 --> 07:41.255
<i>Your new home is so beautiful,</i>
<i>but I did not bring</i>

07:41.257 --> 07:43.624
<i>- a housewarming gift.</i>
<i>- Hey, you know what?</i>

07:43.626 --> 07:46.544
<i>Don't even sweat it,</i>
<i>because... Hmm?</i>

07:46.546 --> 07:52.216
<i>Hai. Hai.</i>
<i>Hai.</i> Mm-kay, bye.

07:52.218 --> 07:54.252
Wait-- didn't you
shoot that guy?

07:54.254 --> 07:57.438
Oh, who remembers?
Well, what did he say?

07:57.440 --> 07:59.590
Well, he's not happy,
obviously, and he wants his

07:59.592 --> 08:02.443
drugs back, and that guy
who sold 'em to me's not

08:02.445 --> 08:05.229
gonna be playing the violin any
time soon.

08:05.231 --> 08:07.365
- Because?
- Because a violin would

08:07.367 --> 08:09.367
probably dissolve in the same
big drum of acid they dissolved

08:09.369 --> 08:11.369
- that guy in.
- Ew!

08:11.371 --> 08:13.438
But if all Moto wants
is his drugs...

08:13.440 --> 08:15.440
Then he can give us
a refund.

08:15.442 --> 08:17.442
Of worthless
counterfeit money?

08:17.444 --> 08:19.443
It's not exactly
worthless.

08:19.445 --> 08:22.246
The right buyer would probably
pay about 15 cents on the dollar

08:22.248 --> 08:23.748
- for it.
- What?!

08:23.750 --> 08:26.317
- Why didn't you say that?!
- Uh, I don't know.

08:26.319 --> 08:28.469
- I assumed you knew.
- Everybody knows that.

08:28.471 --> 08:30.588
- Ron?!
- I say screw the money.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.457
Let's just give Moto his drugs
and be glad we dodged

08:33.460 --> 08:36.360
- this giant metaphorical bullet.
- Hey, and where are we

08:36.361 --> 08:39.363
- on that list?
- Malory?

08:39.365 --> 08:42.332
Oh, all right!
We obviously can't go to war

08:42.335 --> 08:44.402
- with the Yakuza.
- Uh, not without

08:44.404 --> 08:46.337
normal-size, non-metaphorical
bullets.

08:46.339 --> 08:49.207
But, Pam, if there
ever are any, this comes out

08:49.209 --> 08:54.278
of your share of the profits.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.415
- How is that not fair?
- Moto doesn't just want

08:57.417 --> 09:02.420
the pills...!
He also wants my

09:02.422 --> 09:07.592
heh-heh-heh-head!
Non-metaph-phuh-phuh-phuh-phuh-

09:07.594 --> 09:10.428
...phorically
speaking, Pam, we got it.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.330
Wait-- he's still
gonna kill you?

09:12.332 --> 09:14.298
Even if you give back
the pills?

09:14.300 --> 09:16.434
- Yes!
- Oh, hey, hey, shh.

09:16.436 --> 09:20.304
Come on. We're not gonna let the
Yakuza kill you.

09:20.306 --> 09:23.608
Although...

09:23.610 --> 09:25.876
Christ on
drums, people! What?!

09:25.878 --> 09:28.479
Pam screwed the
Yakuza out of a million bucks

09:28.481 --> 09:31.349
of amphetamines, so now they're
gonna cut her head off.

09:31.351 --> 09:32.733
Wait--
since breakfast?!

09:32.735 --> 09:34.452
- You had breakfast here?!
- Ron!

09:34.454 --> 09:36.420
And apparently, they've
got your house completely

09:36.422 --> 09:38.523
- surrounded, so...
- So call

09:38.525 --> 09:40.625
- the police.
- Ooh, good idea, and

09:40.627 --> 09:43.528
when they get here, we can show
them the drugs we bought

09:43.530 --> 09:46.564
with the counterfeit money we
got from selling cocaine.

09:46.566 --> 09:49.283
Oh, and by the way, Officer,
there's another 2,000

09:49.285 --> 09:51.369
- pounds of it in the pantry!
- So, then

09:51.371 --> 09:53.571
- pay them!
- With what?!

09:53.573 --> 09:56.541
$1 million!
Yes, real dollars.

09:56.543 --> 10:00.261
Duh, look at my house.
I bet I got rugs worth a...

10:00.263 --> 10:04.465
Ugh! Fine, $2 million.
Okay, $5 million.

10:04.467 --> 10:08.436
Fine, $10 million!
$50 million!

10:08.438 --> 10:12.607
A jillion million!
Jesus! Be more gross

10:12.609 --> 10:16.327
and Chinese-y!

10:16.329 --> 10:19.280
Been waiting
forever to use that.

10:19.282 --> 10:21.332
Why did you insult him?

10:21.334 --> 10:23.367
A, "Chinese-y"
is not an insult.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.369
- Mm, no.
- No, it totally is.

10:25.371 --> 10:27.371
- Not to a Chinaman.
- And B,

10:27.373 --> 10:29.373
which is, like, so un-Chinesey,
he doesn't even care

10:29.375 --> 10:31.425
about money.
He said it's a debt of honor,

10:31.427 --> 10:33.644
and it can only be paid with
Pam's blood.

10:33.646 --> 10:36.480
And since I can't write a
genre-defining country song

10:36.482 --> 10:39.350
with you people screaming
about a horde of Chinese

10:39.352 --> 10:41.602
daylight vampires, who are
probably scuttling up the drain

10:41.604 --> 10:44.655
pipes even as we speak,
go out there and kill them!

10:44.657 --> 10:46.440
Don't even get me
started on that.

10:46.442 --> 10:48.392
How about get started
on that list?

10:48.394 --> 10:50.611
I'm not
your secretary, Lana!

10:50.613 --> 10:53.397
We don't really have weapons
or ammo.

10:53.399 --> 10:55.399
You're
shitting me.

10:55.401 --> 10:57.435
- Mm, no.
- Ugh!

10:57.437 --> 10:59.537
Whoa, I stand
extremely corrected.

10:59.539 --> 11:01.439
Yeah, and
they're all loaded.

11:01.441 --> 11:04.492
This was the best house to be a
kid in.

11:04.494 --> 11:07.311
Mmm, yeah, and so...
anything post-World War I?

11:07.313 --> 11:09.530
I don't know.
I think Grandpapa lost interest

11:09.532 --> 11:11.649
once he filled the Museum of
Natural History with

11:11.651 --> 11:14.285
dead animals.
Then he got real big into model

11:14.287 --> 11:16.621
trains, and then it was a sort
of very long, sad slide into

11:16.623 --> 11:19.357
dementia, and ultimately,
into death.

11:19.359 --> 11:22.293
And the whole time he was
screwing the asses off all the

11:22.295 --> 11:25.546
colored maids.
No, that's a terrible

11:25.548 --> 11:27.565
- country song.
- Here's your country

11:27.567 --> 11:30.634
song right here!

11:30.636 --> 11:33.437
Have you ever heard
a country song?

11:33.439 --> 11:35.356
Um, "Danger Zone"?

11:35.358 --> 11:39.577
Okay, listen up, there
are way too many windows and

11:39.579 --> 11:42.480
doors to cover, so we need
to concentrate on chokepoints.

11:42.482 --> 11:45.616
Not that kind of chokepoints.

11:45.618 --> 11:48.319
Chokepoints as in junctions,
like the main foyer, the

11:48.321 --> 11:50.388
kitchen, the top of the
grand staircase, the...

11:50.390 --> 11:52.373
What are you doing?
Here.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.375
- Noop...
- What do you mean,

11:54.377 --> 11:56.377
"noop"?
Take it!

11:56.379 --> 11:58.429
Woman, I am not getting
in a shootout with the

11:58.431 --> 12:01.432
goddamn Yakuza because you
people decided to steal

12:01.434 --> 12:03.500
- their drugs!
- Well, I support you

12:03.502 --> 12:06.304
in your work!
Not that you ever do any, but...

12:06.306 --> 12:08.522
If you were honest with
yourself, you would realize

12:08.524 --> 12:11.559
I have been incredibly
supportive of you!

12:11.561 --> 12:14.362
Get arrested for treason,
I stand by you; become

12:14.364 --> 12:18.382
a drug dealer, I stand by you.
Oh-oh-oh! And you don't seem to

12:18.384 --> 12:20.384
mind driving around
in a new Cadillac, do you?

12:20.386 --> 12:22.370
- A floor model.
- Oh, for...

12:22.372 --> 12:24.372
What the...?

12:24.374 --> 12:26.390
Sterling?!
What in the...?!

12:26.392 --> 12:28.392
Hell does he think
he is doing?

12:28.394 --> 12:30.394
Going Josh Randall on
these dicks!

12:30.396 --> 12:32.396
Cheryl, build a fire and get
some pokers hot!

12:32.398 --> 12:34.398
Yeah, great, start

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
shooting.
I can't wait to meet every cop

12:36.402 --> 12:38.402
- in Manhattan.
- Ugh, right, damn.

12:38.404 --> 12:40.838
Hey, Carol, you got any
old-timey silencers?

12:40.840 --> 12:43.624
Silence, yes, aspire to
that while I think of a plan.

12:43.626 --> 12:46.510
Okay, Cheryl...
Goddamn it, Archer!

12:46.512 --> 12:50.348
I didn't do it!
I was just...

12:50.350 --> 12:53.384
Wha... Ron?!

12:53.386 --> 12:56.303
- Ron!
- Talk about a

12:56.305 --> 12:58.589
floor model.
Oh, come on, we were all

12:58.591 --> 13:01.492
- thinking it.
- Get down!

13:01.494 --> 13:05.496
Tadashi, what is wrong

13:05.498 --> 13:08.366
with you?!
You shoot like an old

13:08.368 --> 13:12.074
blind woman!
You bring shame on your family!

13:22.309 --> 13:25.217
Oh, my God, the
darkness, babe, I'm slipping

13:25.337 --> 13:27.290
- into the darkness!
- They're just

13:27.292 --> 13:29.734
- pulling the drapes!
- Still, though...

13:30.031 --> 13:31.931
And what is this?
An ocelot pelt?!

13:31.933 --> 13:33.816
- Wait, what?!
- It was all

13:33.818 --> 13:35.101
- I could find!
- Oh, my God,

13:35.103 --> 13:36.953
- if that's Babou...!
- Ugh, I wish.

13:36.955 --> 13:39.038
He's around here somewhere,
either puking or pissing on

13:39.040 --> 13:41.908
- something I care about.
- Hey, so...

13:41.910 --> 13:43.910
- Ron's gonna die?
- Wait, Ron's

13:43.912 --> 13:46.078
- gonna die?!
- Aah, the darkness!

13:46.080 --> 13:48.781
Especially if he goes
into shock, which is why I'm

13:48.783 --> 13:50.984
- speaking quietly.
- Smart.

13:50.986 --> 13:53.019
We have to get him to a
hospital, so are you sure

13:53.021 --> 13:55.755
there's no other way out of here
besides the front door?

13:55.757 --> 13:57.757
Like, maybe a helicopter pad,
or...?

13:57.759 --> 13:59.759
The only thing
I can think of is all the

13:59.761 --> 14:01.761
secret tunnels.

14:01.763 --> 14:03.930
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah, they go

14:03.932 --> 14:05.932
everywhere.
My... I want to say my

14:05.934 --> 14:08.801
great-great-great-uncle?
He built them trying to tap into

14:08.803 --> 14:10.870
- the Underground Railroad.
- Wait, did he think it

14:10.872 --> 14:12.855
- was literally...?
- A subterranean

14:12.857 --> 14:15.024
- railroad, yeah, so...
- So why'd he build a

14:15.026 --> 14:17.026
- bunch of tunnels?
- To capture

14:17.028 --> 14:19.812
runaway slaves and sell them
back to their rightful owners.

14:19.814 --> 14:22.048
- Wow.
- Ugh, whatever, can

14:22.050 --> 14:24.117
- we...?
- I want to say

14:24.119 --> 14:27.036
his plan was to dress like a
ghost?

14:27.038 --> 14:30.840
Can we get Ron
to a hospital?

14:30.842 --> 14:34.761
Oh, totally.
And then this one here goes all

14:34.763 --> 14:36.996
the way up to Lenox Hill
Hospital.

14:36.998 --> 14:38.998
Jesus, that's like a
mile.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.768
Yeah, you don't
want to walk that, so I'd come

14:41.770 --> 14:45.772
up around here and get a cab.
That'll be way quicker.

14:45.774 --> 14:48.841
- Plus I bet there's mole people.
- Okay, I think her

14:48.843 --> 14:51.728
point was, with all this, your
great-whatever uncle must have

14:51.730 --> 14:53.863
really wanted to catch some
slaves.

14:53.865 --> 14:55.898
Oh, it
bankrupted him, and the crazy

14:55.900 --> 14:59.986
- part, is this was, like, 1890.
- Will you hurry up?

14:59.988 --> 15:02.021
We're losing him.

15:02.023 --> 15:04.707
Ron, shut up!
Okay, Carol, you know the

15:04.709 --> 15:06.859
tunnels, you lead the group.
Cyril and Pam, you carry Ron.

15:06.861 --> 15:08.861
- Lana...
- Why do I have to carry

15:08.863 --> 15:10.863
- him?
- Because remember

15:10.865 --> 15:12.882
before when this whole goddamn
thing was your fault?!

15:12.884 --> 15:14.901
- Just asking.
- Lana and Mother, you

15:14.903 --> 15:17.070
should go with them, because my
plan may not work.

15:17.072 --> 15:19.072
- What plan?
- Okay, this tunnel

15:19.074 --> 15:22.008
here tees into a utility tunnel
right in front of the house.

15:22.010 --> 15:24.761
- So...?
- So I need my slightly

15:24.763 --> 15:28.047
darker-black black suit.
Woodhouse!

15:28.049 --> 15:30.817
Goddamn it, where the hell
is he?

15:30.819 --> 15:35.121
Slowly dying, for
all anyone cares.

15:35.123 --> 15:39.125
But the saddest part is
no one does.

15:39.127 --> 15:41.727
Oh, who cares?

15:41.729 --> 15:43.913
Aw, quit your literal
bellyaching.

15:43.915 --> 15:45.915
Yeah, I'm staying.
Because if your plan is what I

15:45.917 --> 15:48.918
think it is, you are totally
gonna need rescuing.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.871
No, I'm not, Lana, so
shut your dicktrap.

15:51.873 --> 15:55.041
But if I do, I-I apologize for

15:55.043 --> 15:58.928
that remark, and ask that you
definitely do rescue me.

15:58.930 --> 16:01.714
- Or avenge me as appropriate.
- That's it, I'm

16:01.716 --> 16:03.716
- staying, too.
- What?

16:03.718 --> 16:05.785
- You're picking him over me?
- Oh, for... It's not a

16:05.787 --> 16:07.954
competition, Ron!
He's my child.

16:07.956 --> 16:10.757
But seriously?
A floor model?

16:10.759 --> 16:12.859
Aw!
What are you people, hourly?

16:12.861 --> 16:14.977
Let's go here.

16:14.979 --> 16:18.097
Are you

16:18.099 --> 16:20.733
laughing at "dicktrap"?

16:20.735 --> 16:22.952
Uh-huh, but
seriously, though, if it comes

16:22.954 --> 16:25.938
- down to it, please do rescue me.
- Okay!

16:25.940 --> 16:27.940
Sorry!
I'm walking backwards here.

16:27.942 --> 16:30.093
God, you're killing me
here is what you're doing.

16:30.095 --> 16:32.979
- Just try to stay calm.
- Yeah, chill

16:32.981 --> 16:36.966
out, Ray got shot in the stomach
and he's, like, totally fine.

16:39.688 --> 16:42.021
Here we go, stepping

16:42.023 --> 16:44.891
it up! Hey-oh!

16:44.893 --> 16:47.894
Jesus, Ron, man up.
I've been shot...

16:47.896 --> 16:51.898
holy shit, 26 times?
Can't be good for me.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.900
I mean, in gangster movies,
they're always like...

16:53.902 --> 16:56.069
"He got a bad case of
lead poisoning, see!"

16:56.071 --> 16:59.072
But think about it, every
bullet's got to leave at least a

16:59.074 --> 17:01.874
teeny bit of residual lead in
your body, right?

17:01.876 --> 17:04.827
Shit.
By the time I'm 60, I bet I'll

17:04.829 --> 17:09.749
be mad as a goddamn hatter.

17:09.751 --> 17:11.751
I don't believe it.
He made it.

17:11.752 --> 17:13.886
You never give him
enough credit.

17:13.887 --> 17:16.756
And honestly, not your best
trait.

17:16.758 --> 17:18.958
You may want to work on that,
since you'll be a mother soon.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.810
Unless...
well, I suppose that all depends

17:21.813 --> 17:25.798
on what kind of mother you want
to be.

17:25.800 --> 17:31.971
Uh...
<i>Konnichiwa?</i>

17:31.973 --> 17:34.807
<i>Hmm?</i>
<i>The door-san?</i>

17:34.809 --> 17:37.110
<i>Thanks, Kato!</i>

17:39.748 --> 17:44.751
<i>Yoshi!</i>

17:44.753 --> 17:47.820
<i>I'm sorry, uh, Yoshi</i>

17:47.822 --> 17:49.922
<i>- is indisposed.</i>
<i>- You!</i>

17:49.924 --> 17:53.025
<i>Me.</i>
<i>Scrooch!</i>

17:53.027 --> 17:56.696
<i>- You must know...</i>
<i>- Hang on.</i>

17:56.698 --> 17:58.698
<i>Oh, God.</i>

17:58.700 --> 18:00.700
<i>Sorry, I don't want to get a</i>
<i>dry socket.</i>

18:00.702 --> 18:04.003
<i>You must know that even</i>
<i>if you kill me, the Yakuza will</i>

18:04.005 --> 18:06.773
<i>never forgive this debt of</i>
<i>honor.</i>

18:06.775 --> 18:08.841
<i>They will kill...</i>

18:08.843 --> 18:11.761
<i>Right?</i>
<i>That's so bad for your ears.</i>

18:11.763 --> 18:14.814
<i>But I get it, the Bushido code,</i>
<i>the whole Japanese thing, I get</i>

18:14.816 --> 18:16.816
<i>- it, but...</i>
<i>- What do you know about</i>

18:16.818 --> 18:18.935
<i>- being Japanese?</i>
<i>- I guess only the</i>

18:18.937 --> 18:22.021
<i>clichés, really.</i>
<i>Karaoke, pachinko, subway</i>

18:22.023 --> 18:24.023
<i>- frottage...</i>
<i>- Enough!</i>

18:24.025 --> 18:26.793
<i>Hang on.</i>
<i>Uh, tentacle porn, uh...</i>

18:26.795 --> 18:28.911
<i>- Enough!</i>
<i>- Hang on!</i>

18:28.913 --> 18:31.864
<i>Those vending machines that sell</i>
<i>used schoolgirl panties.</i>

18:31.866 --> 18:34.083
<i>Okay, done.</i>
<i>Now, here's what I propose.</i>

18:34.085 --> 18:37.904
<i>- You dare to propose...</i>
<i>- I swear to God I can</i>

18:37.906 --> 18:40.756
<i>do that all day.</i>
<i>I mean, to me, it sounds like</i>

18:40.758 --> 18:44.877
<i>- bubble wrap.</i>
<i>- What is your proposal?</i>

18:44.879 --> 18:48.208
<i>I know the Yakuza</i>
<i>will hunt us down forever, but I</i>

18:48.328 --> 18:50.783
bet <i>you</i> can forgive the debt of
honor, right?

18:50.785 --> 18:52.802
Only if blood has been
shed.

18:52.804 --> 18:55.054
Well, my stepfa...
my mother's husband is about a

18:55.056 --> 18:58.724
quart low-- you shot him.
So I'm thinking you take back

18:58.726 --> 19:01.694
all... well, almost all the
pills-- Pam ate a bunch, and I'm

19:01.696 --> 19:04.997
not gonna lie to you, I had a
couple, or six-- plus you keep

19:04.999 --> 19:07.867
- the counterfeit million.
- But...

19:07.869 --> 19:09.869
Plus if you don't,
I'll kill you.

19:09.871 --> 19:11.871
Probably should have led with
that.

19:11.873 --> 19:14.874
I must accept.

19:14.876 --> 19:18.945
But I cannot lose <i>mentsu.</i>
<i>What you call "face."</i>

19:18.947 --> 19:21.948
<i>My men must think this was my</i>
<i>decision.</i>

19:21.950 --> 19:24.917
<i>That you somehow</i>
<i>"sweetened the deal."</i>

19:24.919 --> 19:27.820
<i>Well, at this</i>
<i>point, the reds are wearing off</i>

19:27.822 --> 19:30.890
<i>and the bourbon's kicking in,</i>
<i>so, uh, you can pretty much name</i>

19:30.892 --> 19:34.810
<i>it.</i>

19:42.670 --> 19:48.774
<i>That is so true.</i>

19:48.776 --> 19:51.110
<i>That was Cyril.</i>
<i>Ron's in surgery, but the bullet</i>

19:51.112 --> 19:53.846
<i>missed everything, and his</i>
<i>prognosis is excellent.</i>

19:53.848 --> 19:55.848
<i>Oh, my God, that's</i>
<i>great, so...</i>

19:55.850 --> 19:57.917
<i>- So win-win!</i>
<i>- Wha..? Win-win?</i>

19:57.919 --> 19:59.919
<i>- Ow!</i>
<i>- Malory.</i>

19:59.921 --> 20:01.921
<i>A gut-shot husband</i>
<i>and an idiot son who just</i>

20:01.923 --> 20:04.840
<i>gave away $5 million</i>
<i>worth of cocaine?</i>

20:04.842 --> 20:07.643
<i>I call that a lose-lose-lose!</i>

20:19.977 --> 20:24.577
<i>What could possibly</i>
<i>be funny?</i>

20:24.697 --> 20:30.623
<i>The phone!</i>
<i>It was Woodhouse's!</i>
