43:21.440 --> 43:22.960
Not only is it drawing attention,

43:23.040 --> 43:25.480
it's receiving positive feedback.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.200
The response within the company
is positive as well.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.320
They even discussed it
during the executives' meeting.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.960
That's a good sign.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.320
Yes.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.200
It's all thanks to you.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.080
I had assigned it
to several people before,

43:38.160 --> 43:39.840
but I didn't like any of them.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.480
Mr. Yoo recommended you, so I was hopeful.

43:43.720 --> 43:44.960
You did great.

43:46.160 --> 43:49.160
Thank you. I enjoyed working on it.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.360
I really like Ms. Kim's writing.
It's really good and on-trend.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.720
-Right?
-Yes.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.640
It has... How do I put it?
A warmth about it.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.360
It's a good fit with our noodles.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.520
The feeling matters more
than getting full, to be honest.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.640
Thank you.

44:06.760 --> 44:10.640
I can't really tell
if I'm good at evoking emotions.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.440
You are. I told you, didn't I?

44:14.440 --> 44:16.880
Ms. Kim. So I was thinking...

44:16.960 --> 44:19.960
Why don't you transfer into Marketing?

44:21.080 --> 44:23.080
-Pardon?
-If you're okay with it,

44:23.160 --> 44:25.040
I can probably make it happen.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.200
Give it some serious thought.
I think it would be great.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.920
-I'll go ahead.
-Yes, ma'am.

44:46.840 --> 44:47.880
Surprised, right?

44:49.040 --> 44:50.280
What happened?

44:50.360 --> 44:51.640
I was surprised too.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.480
She must have really liked your writing.

44:54.920 --> 44:57.440
Did she really mean what she said?

44:57.520 --> 44:58.560
Of course.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.600
You should've said yes.
Why do you need to think about it?

45:01.680 --> 45:04.440
I was so caught off guard.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.320
I've never considered it before.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.360
Marketing is
our most successful department.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.160
That's why this is a good thing.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.080
There's nothing to think about.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.880
[Yes, it's a good thing.]

45:34.560 --> 45:36.400
[Of course, I should go to Marketing.]

45:37.640 --> 45:39.160

[I'm scared.]

[I don't have the courage to start over.]

46:04.960 --> 46:06.320
Do I not have courage?

46:07.280 --> 46:09.320
[Yes, you do.]

46:11.280 --> 46:12.400
Where is it?

46:12.480 --> 46:15.040
I know I buried
a pot of courage here somewhere.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.120
Yes. Found it.

46:18.680 --> 46:19.680
There.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.160
When did you bury this?

46:22.240 --> 46:23.440
A while ago.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.320
We never needed courage.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.640
There should be enough left though.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.800
What? Only two scoops?

46:36.880 --> 46:38.320
Isn't this enough?

I doubt it. Look at this.

Transferring departments
requires seven scoops. What now?

47:52.120 --> 47:55.400
It's okay. We can borrow courage
if we're short.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.480

Yes. Let's borrow some from Mr. Nam first.

you transfer into her department?

Yes.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.840
No, this is wrong. Very wrong.

48:21.720 --> 48:23.680
It's wrong to hesitate like this.

doesn't mean it's a good fit for everyone.

55:25.280 --> 55:28.320
Promise me that we'll always be happy.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.480
-Yes!
-Yes!

55:29.560 --> 55:32.200
If you promise, make an O above your head!

55:33.320 --> 55:34.480
I promise!

55:34.560 --> 55:36.400
Let's meet again the next time

55:36.640 --> 55:37.920
Yu-mi is fed up.

55:38.640 --> 55:39.760
Thank you.

55:40.280 --> 55:42.240
I'm Endorphin!

55:45.360 --> 55:47.600
That was such a great concert.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.440
I hope Yu-mi gets fed up again real soon.

55:53.160 --> 55:54.360
Thank you.

55:54.480 --> 55:55.680
Come again.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.800
[Did you get home safely?]

56:08.440 --> 56:10.040
[I did. Where are you?]

56:11.120 --> 56:12.200
[Home.]

56:16.320 --> 56:19.160
[Did you eat?]

56:17.400 --> 56:18.520
[Did you eat?]

56:19.880 --> 56:21.480
[Yes. I had something simple.]

56:24.360 --> 56:25.640
[I feel better now.]

56:25.760 --> 56:27.400
[I was feeling down.]

56:28.080 --> 56:29.600
[Should we make up with Woong then?]

56:30.440 --> 56:31.440
[Now?]

56:31.640 --> 56:33.240
[Sooner the better.]

56:33.320 --> 56:35.360
[Let's not let bad feelings fester.]

56:43.600 --> 56:45.440
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

56:45.560 --> 56:47.560
Let me get two orders of tteokbokki to go.

56:47.920 --> 56:49.640
Okay. Just a minute.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.720
Fish cakes and tempura too.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.440
-I'll give you extra.
-Thank you.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.760
Why are there

57:13.440 --> 57:15.600
[Late Night Snacks,
Kyung's Webfoot Octopus]

57:14.640 --> 57:15.800
so many flyers?

57:16.320 --> 57:17.800
[Hold on.]

57:17.880 --> 57:19.760
Don't flyers fall to the ground

57:19.840 --> 57:21.760
when you open the door?

57:21.880 --> 57:23.920
There are way too many there.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.240
Maybe they came after Woong went in.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.680
That many already? In that short a time?

57:49.600 --> 57:50.640
What?

57:51.560 --> 57:52.920
Did he fall asleep already?

58:04.880 --> 58:06.000
[Hey, Yu-mi.]

58:06.680 --> 58:08.440
Were you sleeping?

58:08.800 --> 58:10.560
[No, I'm not sleeping.]

58:23.680 --> 58:25.400
Where are you right now?

58:26.160 --> 58:27.240
[I'm home.]

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
Woong.

58:31.360 --> 58:34.200
I'm in front of your place right now.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.200
What?

58:38.200 --> 58:39.520
You're not home,

58:40.760 --> 58:41.840
are you?

58:48.760 --> 58:49.840
Where are you?

58:57.600 --> 58:58.600
Woong.

58:59.760 --> 59:00.960
What's going on?

59:43.800 --> 59:46.720
[Yumi's Cells]

59:47.080 --> 59:48.960
[Why am I always the only one
out of the loop]

59:49.040 --> 59:50.400
when something important happens?

59:50.640 --> 59:53.120
Master.
Something's wrong with the village.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.720
[Something big must've happened.]

59:54.800 --> 59:57.600
[Stop what is about to happen to Woong.]

59:57.880 --> 1:00:01.160
[It's not like you need a clear goal
in order to succeed.]

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:02.520
[I may like it]

1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:05.040
[once I try it.]

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:07.320
[And I may see a goal once I do it.]

1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:10.200
[I'm sure there will be difficulties,]

1:00:10.520 --> 1:00:12.160
[but I don't want to know in advance.]

1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:14.120
[Now that I live with him,]

1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:16.920
[I think Woong is a better person
than I had thought.]

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.480
Let's ask Woong
if he wants to get married eventually.

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:22.600
Woong.
