We just got to be sneaky.

08:15.530 --> 08:17.274
Like a coyote.

08:17.298 --> 08:19.343
Oh, I like the sound of this.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.145
Listen, the last show
on Saturday night

08:21.169 --> 08:22.313
lets out at 11:00.

08:22.337 --> 08:23.481
Once my manager drives off,

08:23.505 --> 08:25.382
the theater's ours.

08:25.406 --> 08:27.785
It'll be a secret,
one night only,

08:27.809 --> 08:30.654
midnight screening
of a <i> Hawk & Chick</i> movie.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.123
Okay, we'll do it. Yes!

08:32.147 --> 08:34.291
Thanks, Dominic.
You're all right.

08:34.315 --> 08:36.494
So which <i> Hawk & Chick</i> movies
do you have prints of?

08:36.518 --> 08:39.462
- "Prints"? Yeah, you know, a print?
- Thing that goes in the projector?

08:39.486 --> 08:42.400
- Makes pictures on the screen?
- Oh, we don't have one of those.

08:42.424 --> 08:44.668
No, we just thought
we could bring our VHS tapes

08:44.692 --> 08:47.204
and just fast-forward
through the commerci...

08:47.228 --> 08:48.839
Okay, I realize
how terrible that sounds.

08:48.863 --> 08:51.175
Hmm, maybe I can find one.

08:51.199 --> 08:53.577
All right, you know, I'll poke
around on some film forums.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.646
You're lucky I was planning
to go online today.

08:55.670 --> 08:56.881
LINDA: <i>Ooh, exciting!</i>

08:56.905 --> 09:00.084
An illegal samurai
film festival!

09:00.108 --> 09:01.485
I like all those words!

09:01.509 --> 09:02.920
Now all we need is a movie.

09:02.944 --> 09:04.922
And we got to convince Yuki
to want to reunite

09:04.946 --> 09:06.424
with her father,
who she might hate.

09:06.448 --> 09:08.426
And we need flyers!

09:08.450 --> 09:11.129
But how do we advertise
a secret film screening?

09:14.055 --> 09:15.699
Psst. You like movies?

09:15.723 --> 09:17.001
Yeah, I like movies.

09:17.025 --> 09:18.202
Are you cool?

09:18.226 --> 09:19.236
What do you mean?

09:19.260 --> 09:20.414
Forget it! Keep moving.

09:20.439 --> 09:23.074
How's it going? Some of
these people seem cool,

09:23.098 --> 09:24.408
but they're not!

09:24.432 --> 09:26.243
How can you tell? You can tell.

09:26.267 --> 09:27.778
So, uh, trash can?

09:27.802 --> 09:30.114
No. I think we owe it
to an old Japanese man

09:30.138 --> 09:32.283
and his middle-aged daughter
to see this through.

09:32.307 --> 09:33.884
Wow, that just got me.

09:33.908 --> 09:35.719
Let's try the quad
at the community college.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.688
There's two things
those honkys love...

09:37.712 --> 09:39.190
foreign films
and flyers telling them

09:39.214 --> 09:40.891
where other honkys will be!

09:40.915 --> 09:43.619
Well, this is the address
Kojima gave us.

09:45.453 --> 09:47.198
That's her! That's Chick!

09:47.222 --> 09:49.100
It's so gross to see her
behind a desk.

09:49.124 --> 09:51.936
She should be slicing up
the Snow Monster

09:51.960 --> 09:54.538
or the Six-Headed Sumo!
God, idiot!

09:54.562 --> 09:59.228
Please don't call her an idiot to her face.
Just get it out now. Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

09:59.300 --> 10:02.580
All right, let's go get Yuki
to say yes to the fest.

10:02.604 --> 10:03.647
No. What?

10:03.671 --> 10:06.217
Look, I haven't even thought
about those movies in years.

10:06.241 --> 10:08.385
Okay, okay, we're
giving you a chance

10:08.409 --> 10:10.755
to feel like a movie star again.

10:10.779 --> 10:13.991
You can see yourself up
on the big screen instead of staring

10:14.015 --> 10:17.261
at that number screen
on your desk there.

10:17.285 --> 10:19.563
I'm very happy as an accountant.
No, you're not.

10:19.587 --> 10:21.265
I am. You're depressed.

10:21.289 --> 10:23.300
No, I'm not.
You didn't let me finish!

10:23.324 --> 10:25.302
"Ing" me. Depressing me!

10:25.326 --> 10:27.772
Louise? I mean, who makes 14

10:27.796 --> 10:30.074
amazing movies with their dad,

10:30.098 --> 10:31.976
and then just
walks away one day?!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.677
Who does that, Yuki?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.780
Louise, stop. Who does that?!

10:35.804 --> 10:38.482
Louise? I'm sure it wasn't easy working
with your dad all those years.

10:38.506 --> 10:40.584
I-I know. I get it.
I've been there.

10:40.608 --> 10:42.319
Wrong. Wrong!

10:42.343 --> 10:44.155
Working with your dad is fun.

10:44.179 --> 10:46.157
I mean working
with <i> your</i> dad was fun.

10:46.181 --> 10:49.460
Because he was a samurai
and you killed monsters!

10:49.484 --> 10:52.963
- Yuki, um, can we have a minute, please?
- Look, Louise, she obviously doesn't want

10:52.987 --> 10:54.598
to reconnect with her father.

10:54.622 --> 10:56.033
We should call off
the screening.

10:56.057 --> 10:58.269
What? No way! We
need to get her butt

10:58.293 --> 11:00.438
into that theater
so she can apologize to Koji.

11:00.462 --> 11:02.139
I think it's more
like Kojima needs

11:02.163 --> 11:04.141
to apologize to Yuki
for driving her away.

11:04.165 --> 11:05.609
Yuki didn't want
his life, Louise!

11:05.633 --> 11:07.178
So we're in agreement.

11:07.202 --> 11:09.046
We're not gonna tell
her that her dad's here!

11:09.070 --> 11:10.514
Wait. What?
We're gonna trick her.

11:10.538 --> 11:12.383
We are?
Shh, shh, shh! Here she comes.

11:12.407 --> 11:16.053
So, about that film festival...
can we put you down as a "yes"?

11:16.077 --> 11:17.688
I'm not so sure.

11:17.712 --> 11:20.224
Yuki, Yuki, come on, Yuke.

11:20.248 --> 11:21.659
Just say yes.

11:21.683 --> 11:23.194
Imagine a packed theater

11:23.218 --> 11:25.196
of your adoring fans
all there for you!

11:25.220 --> 11:27.631
Just you, no Hawk.
It'll be Chick's night.

11:27.655 --> 11:28.999
(loud gasping)

11:29.023 --> 11:33.070
We love you, Yuki! Ah! Ah!
What is...?

11:33.094 --> 11:36.598
She's doing a... like, a lot of people
cheering, but it sounds more like a ghost.

11:36.622 --> 11:41.908
Well, you do it, Dad. Can you do
it. I guess that could be fun.

11:41.932 --> 11:43.737
All right, what
the hell. I'll go.

11:43.761 --> 11:44.843
Great! Great!

11:47.575 --> 11:50.384
- So you got her to come? BOTH: Yup.
- That's great. Mm-hmm.

11:50.408 --> 11:51.752
Did you use my icebreaker?

11:51.776 --> 11:53.187
Pretend to rob the place? No.

11:53.211 --> 11:55.222
Did you file for
an extension on your taxes?

11:55.246 --> 11:57.558
No, Tina. That's a myth.
You can't do that.

11:57.582 --> 11:59.693
Well, how does Yuki feel
about seeing her father?

11:59.717 --> 12:02.763
We might not have told her
that her dad was gonna be there.

12:02.787 --> 12:05.032
On purpose by accident.
What? Yup.

12:05.056 --> 12:06.700
Nice. You tricked her! Yup.

12:06.724 --> 12:08.803
I'm not sure you can trick
people into reuniting.

12:08.827 --> 12:11.305
Not true. That's how they got
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover

12:11.329 --> 12:13.274
back together
for <i> Lethal Weapon 3.</i>

12:13.298 --> 12:14.708
Yeah, I read that.

12:14.732 --> 12:16.610
This is gonna work, people.

12:16.634 --> 12:18.779
Yuki's gonna see <i> Hawk & Chick</i>
up on the big screen,

12:18.803 --> 12:21.649
get all weepy like Koji did,
and realize how crazy she's been,

12:21.673 --> 12:23.784
and we're gonna be heroes,
and we're gonna be invited

12:23.808 --> 12:26.053
to the premiere
of their next movie in Japan!

12:26.077 --> 12:28.055
Ooh, I got to get a passport.

12:28.079 --> 12:30.391
Guess who got the print. Me!

12:30.415 --> 12:32.092
I freaking love this guy!

12:32.116 --> 12:34.061
Dominic! Ah, come here.

12:34.085 --> 12:35.462
Which one is it?

12:35.486 --> 12:37.464
<i>Hawk & Chick
versus Seaweed Monster.</i>

12:37.488 --> 12:39.233
Ooh, Seaweed Monster, scary!

12:39.257 --> 12:40.801
Only thing...

12:40.825 --> 12:43.404
it's an original 35
millimeter print from Japan.

12:43.428 --> 12:45.072
That's incredible.

12:45.096 --> 12:47.408
No, I mean, original, vintage.

12:47.432 --> 12:48.843
It's not dubbed in English.

12:48.867 --> 12:50.177
It's not even subtitled.

12:50.201 --> 12:51.979
Oh. Yeah.

12:52.003 --> 12:54.415
Well, so, can't you just whip up
some English subtitles?

12:54.439 --> 12:56.917
Oh, sure. Yeah, I'll just add
some words to the screen.

12:56.941 --> 12:58.752
What do you think
this is, future world?

12:58.776 --> 13:00.454
I have an idea...
not about this.

13:00.478 --> 13:02.122
Okay, wait. No, I got
one about this, too.

13:02.146 --> 13:03.524
I have, like, six ideas.

13:03.548 --> 13:05.015
The third one's about this.

13:06.451 --> 13:08.295
Dubbing it ourselves?
Great idea.

13:08.319 --> 13:10.197
Thanks, Gene. Guys.

13:10.221 --> 13:11.966
All right, I typed up
all the subtitles

13:11.990 --> 13:13.601
from <i>Hawk & Chick
versus Seaweed Monster.</i>

13:13.625 --> 13:15.269
Did you guys know
about spell check?

13:15.293 --> 13:16.670
It's amazing.

13:16.694 --> 13:18.506
It tells you
if you misspell something.

13:18.530 --> 13:21.108
I mean, it's... Some of it
is open to interpretation.

13:21.132 --> 13:22.776
But, you know, it's helpful.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.779
- Here's everyone's parts.
- How many characters are you playing?

13:25.803 --> 13:27.181
Three. Ah, three's good.

13:27.205 --> 13:28.616
I'm doing four characters,

13:28.640 --> 13:30.384
but I guess, you know,
I'm more experienced.

13:30.408 --> 13:32.453
But I've got a lot of lines
because I'm the mayor.

13:32.477 --> 13:34.355
You're the mayor?!

13:34.379 --> 13:36.891
Bob, she's the mayor?!
Lin, it doesn't matter.

13:36.915 --> 13:39.393
Tina, Tina, let me be the mayor.
Back off.

13:39.417 --> 13:42.062
Let's dub, people!
Rub a dub dub!

13:42.086 --> 13:45.833
(rhythmic clicking)

13:45.857 --> 13:48.702
BOB: It has been many days since
we have loaned you our lantern.

13:48.726 --> 13:50.237
Can we have it back now?

13:50.261 --> 13:53.174
GENE: Yes. I see you are
returning the lantern

13:53.198 --> 13:55.409
with less lantern oil
than when I lent it to you.

13:55.433 --> 13:58.546
Also, the wick is
in need of replacement.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.914
Lot of lantern talk.

13:59.938 --> 14:02.049
There's always a lot
of lantern talk.

14:02.073 --> 14:03.624
You get into it. Already there.

14:03.649 --> 14:06.921
As the mayor of this village...
As the mayor of this village...

14:06.945 --> 14:08.612
Mom, back off. Seriously.

14:10.048 --> 14:11.826
All right, don't forget,
secret screening,

14:11.850 --> 14:13.828
so we cannot look like a line!

14:13.852 --> 14:16.163
The manager's gonna come out
pretty soon and go home.

14:16.187 --> 14:17.765
We're just 40-some-odd people

14:17.789 --> 14:19.834
who happen to be standing here.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.503
So, look at your phones
or up at the sky

14:22.527 --> 14:24.238
and whistle or something.

14:24.262 --> 14:26.106
Oh. Okay. Like this? Great.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.741
Wait, wait.
Too many shoe tie-ers,

14:27.765 --> 14:29.043
One of you hail a cab.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.444
Taxi!

14:30.468 --> 14:32.046
What do I do?

14:32.070 --> 14:34.872
Commit, commit, get in,
circle the block.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.586
Hello.

14:38.610 --> 14:39.887
Right this way, talent.

14:39.911 --> 14:41.755
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

14:41.779 --> 14:43.390
Are those from my rose bush?

14:43.414 --> 14:45.626
Shh, shh. Tonight,
you're a celebrity again.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.595
You don't have
a worry in the world.

14:47.619 --> 14:49.363
Well, I'm worried
about my roses.

14:49.387 --> 14:51.532
They're fine. They're fine.
They're resilient!

14:51.556 --> 14:53.200
LINDA: Hi, Yuki!

14:53.224 --> 14:54.768
Belcher family limo
at your service!

14:54.792 --> 14:56.971
You'll notice a bottle
of water on your seat.

14:56.995 --> 14:59.240
That's for you, because
celebrities gets thirstier

14:59.264 --> 15:00.608
than normal people.

15:00.632 --> 15:02.076
The cheese sticks
hidden in the seat...

15:02.100 --> 15:03.477
uh, those are not for you.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.079
I will now put up
the privacy divider

15:05.103 --> 15:06.614
for the remainder of your ride.

15:06.638 --> 15:08.071
(imitates window whirring up)

15:10.975 --> 15:13.277
(mutters)

15:15.847 --> 15:18.058
Okay, he's gone.
Get 'em in! Get 'em in!

15:18.082 --> 15:20.094
Oh, crap, they're early!

15:20.118 --> 15:21.795
Aw, crap, we're early!

15:21.819 --> 15:23.330
They can't see each other yet!

15:23.354 --> 15:25.266
I know! First Yuki's
got to watch the movie,

15:25.290 --> 15:27.067
feel bad and want to
repair their relationship!

15:27.091 --> 15:28.636
I know! Our perfect plan!
Flawless!

15:28.660 --> 15:30.905
We got to get him inside!
Koji, come on.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.773
But I am giving
Kevin an autograph.

15:32.797 --> 15:35.910
Ugh. Forget Kevin.
Inside, now, let's go!

15:35.934 --> 15:37.611
Gene! Privacy screen!
Get in there! Ah!

15:37.635 --> 15:39.814
Aah! Ow! Aah!
You need privacy! Be private!

15:39.838 --> 15:41.749
We got to move! Let's move!
Ow, you hit me.

15:41.773 --> 15:42.817
That was... Kevin.

15:42.841 --> 15:43.841
Kevin, get away!

15:43.842 --> 15:44.919
Get away, Kevin!

15:44.943 --> 15:46.353
(as Kevin): Ah, you got me away!

15:46.377 --> 15:48.572
Watch out for the... Ugh! Ow!

15:52.915 --> 15:54.226
Okay, privacy's over.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.261
You had some you time. Thanks.

15:56.285 --> 15:58.597
Okay, we'll come and get you
when it's about to start!

15:58.621 --> 16:00.065
Wait. Why can't I go in now?

16:00.089 --> 16:02.001
Yeah, just relax
and enjoy the green room.

16:02.025 --> 16:04.003
Sorry it's not
actually green, or a room.

16:04.027 --> 16:05.971
You may have one cheese stick!

16:05.995 --> 16:07.773
Okay, just sit here
and be quiet.

16:07.797 --> 16:09.341
And keep the jacket on your head

16:09.365 --> 16:10.442
till the movie starts.

16:10.466 --> 16:11.644
It's very cold in here.

16:11.668 --> 16:14.002
Okay. Got it. No problem.

16:15.605 --> 16:17.082
Enjoy the movie, lady!

16:17.106 --> 16:19.918
You're in it! And
here's some tissues.

16:19.942 --> 16:22.511
They're good for when something
life-changing happens.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.280
All right, here we go.

16:26.816 --> 16:28.594
LINDA: It was a time in Japan

16:28.618 --> 16:30.596
when evil monsters would attack

16:30.620 --> 16:33.299
nice little villages
for no good reason.

16:33.323 --> 16:37.102
<i>And the only force in all
of Japan who could stop them...</i>

16:37.126 --> 16:38.804
<i>Hawk & Chick!</i>

16:38.828 --> 16:40.539
BOB (as Hawk):
There's a village up ahead.

16:40.563 --> 16:42.341
Maybe there's hair
that needs cutting.

16:42.365 --> 16:45.210
LOUISE: And hopefully,
no monsters that need defeating.

16:45.234 --> 16:47.112
This is amazing! I know!

16:47.136 --> 16:49.114
We're incredible. We really are.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.950
TINA: Oh, no, seaweed monster!

16:50.974 --> 16:54.109
You're ruining my haircut,
and I'm the mayor!

16:57.013 --> 16:58.557
Aah! (Grunting) (grunting)

16:58.581 --> 17:00.693
Seaweed monster, let me go!

17:00.717 --> 17:02.661
So, you loving the movie?

17:02.685 --> 17:05.531
No. Not really.
It's kind of painful?

17:05.555 --> 17:08.133
Uh-huh. You want some popcorn?
Sure.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.501
It is finally dead.

17:09.525 --> 17:11.136
Father! It's not all dead!

17:11.160 --> 17:14.373
(low, distorted): Part of it
still wishes to fight.

17:14.396 --> 17:16.642
That's not how I sound.
Is that how I sound?

17:16.665 --> 17:18.810
No! Oh, God, I think
the batteries are dying!

17:18.835 --> 17:20.435
But we put new batteries
in this morning!

17:20.435 --> 17:21.981
How could this happen?

17:22.005 --> 17:25.584
Fast-forward! Rewind!
Fast-forward! Rewind!

17:25.608 --> 17:28.487
Well, it's not that bad.
Maybe no one will notice.

17:28.511 --> 17:30.923
(low and garbled):
Let's send this thing

17:30.947 --> 17:34.593
back to the... Okay,
that's really bad.

17:34.617 --> 17:36.028
We got to do something!

17:36.052 --> 17:38.030
There's a mic.
I think we got to wing it.

17:38.054 --> 17:40.014
Good thing we've seen this movie
a thousand times.

17:40.023 --> 17:43.535
Aah! Aah! No longer will you
terrorize this town,

17:43.559 --> 17:44.937
Seaweed Monster.

17:44.961 --> 17:47.072
We are going to weed you out!

17:47.096 --> 17:48.407
Crap, we need the villagers!

17:48.431 --> 17:51.543
Lin! Lin! Psst!
We need you guys up here.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.412
What? Come here! Hurry!

17:53.436 --> 17:55.447
Which way did
the Seaweed Monster go?

17:55.471 --> 17:58.217
That way! No, that way!

17:58.241 --> 18:01.553
GENE: Aah! Monster! Green!
Green! Aah! Aah!

18:01.577 --> 18:03.188
I can't do this.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.791
Oh, God, she's leaving!
Yuki's leaving!

18:05.815 --> 18:07.893
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your plan's not working.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.562
She's having a terrible
time. She told me.

18:09.586 --> 18:10.963
I thought the popcorn would

18:10.987 --> 18:12.298
make her feel better,
but it didn't.

18:12.322 --> 18:13.632
Hang on, it's my line.

18:13.656 --> 18:16.468
Don't hurt me. I'm the mayor.
Mom!

18:16.492 --> 18:18.470
LOUISE: Damn it, Yuki,
you're killing me!

18:18.494 --> 18:19.538
What do we do? What do we do?!

18:19.562 --> 18:20.940
BOB: Wait.

18:20.964 --> 18:22.374
Yuki, don't go!

18:22.398 --> 18:24.109
Huh? I mean, Chick.

18:24.133 --> 18:27.313
I know we're fighting this
Seaweed Monster right now,

18:27.337 --> 18:30.249
but I want you to know how
much I love and support you,

18:30.273 --> 18:32.651
even if you decide...
Hold on. Hiya!

18:32.675 --> 18:34.920
Aah!

18:34.944 --> 18:38.457
To stop fighting monsters
with me someday and...

18:38.481 --> 18:40.259
do taxes instead.

18:40.283 --> 18:42.461
TINA:
And, Hawk, I want you to know...

18:42.485 --> 18:44.263
hiya!... if that ever happens,

18:44.287 --> 18:46.966
it's me who should apologize
for leaving!

18:46.990 --> 18:48.734
'Cause I would be
dumb to do that.

18:48.758 --> 18:50.402
I don't remember this part.

18:50.426 --> 18:51.937
Are the actors really bad?

18:51.961 --> 18:53.572
Yes. They're horrible.

18:53.596 --> 18:55.741
BOB: No! Smash this house!

18:55.765 --> 18:58.744
Chick doesn't need to
apologize for anything!

18:58.768 --> 19:01.513
Chick was just a kid!
And I hit this guy!

19:01.537 --> 19:05.017
But... but... how could
a father and daughter not talk

19:05.041 --> 19:06.819
for 30 freaking years?!

19:06.843 --> 19:08.254
Whoa.

19:08.278 --> 19:10.656
Seaweed Monster suddenly thinks

19:10.680 --> 19:12.491
this might be
about something else.

19:12.515 --> 19:14.493
And I'm squeezing you.
Sorry about that.

19:14.517 --> 19:17.496
Am I gonna turn into someone
completely different someday?

19:17.520 --> 19:19.498
Is that what happens
when you grow up?

19:19.522 --> 19:21.934
You... you grow apart? Listen,

19:21.958 --> 19:24.336
what happened to Hawk and Chick
will never happen to us.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.774
This Hawk and this Chick will
never not talk for 30 years.

19:28.798 --> 19:30.176
You promise?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.811
Yes, of course, Louise.
I mean, Chick.

19:32.835 --> 19:36.482
Foreign films are so much more
complex than Hollywood movies.

19:36.506 --> 19:39.118
(growls) I'm the monster again.

19:39.142 --> 19:41.120
Aah, I'm getting stabbed.

19:41.144 --> 19:42.721
I'm getting... I exploded.

19:42.745 --> 19:44.790
I'm not sure why I... I explo...

19:44.814 --> 19:46.715
I'm dead. I'm gone.

19:48.184 --> 19:49.795
Koji, talk to her.

19:49.819 --> 19:51.854
To who? To Yuki.

19:53.189 --> 19:54.356
My Yuki.

19:57.327 --> 20:00.306
Yuki, it's...
it's your father speaking.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.475
Dad? What are you doing here?

20:02.499 --> 20:04.310
You said he wasn't
gonna be here.

20:04.334 --> 20:05.711
You tricked me.

20:05.735 --> 20:07.847
Uh, surprise.

20:07.871 --> 20:11.851
Yuki, please, I've come all
this way to tell you I miss you.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.686
I am sorry for everything.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.754
I have not been a good father.

20:15.778 --> 20:17.590
Oh, she's thinking about it.

20:17.614 --> 20:19.525
I love you, little Chick.

20:19.549 --> 20:20.926
Oh, Dad.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.284
Oh, he got her. He got her.

20:25.522 --> 20:28.734
(crying): We did it. We did it.

20:28.758 --> 20:30.736
(applauding)

20:30.760 --> 20:32.905
Wow, that ended up working

20:32.929 --> 20:34.707
way better
than I thought it would.

20:34.731 --> 20:37.176
Eh, it went about exactly
the way I thought it would.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.178
So I should get
you kids home, right?

20:39.202 --> 20:40.579
What time is it?

20:40.603 --> 20:42.581
It's after midnight.
Is it a school night?

20:42.605 --> 20:44.583
Yes, and I have
a big test tomorrow.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.751
It's, like, half my grade.
Oh, sorry.

or defeating
a jellyfish monster.

21:14.552 --> 21:17.064
