Worse than bloody sheep!

04:31.160 --> 04:33.799
AIDEN: I'll get my officer
just to go over your statement again

04:33.800 --> 04:35.079
once you've sobered up

04:35.080 --> 04:37.199
and we'll make sure that
everything's in order, OK?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.959
OK.
They'll probably be over quite soon.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.079
I've got to steal him from you,
love. All right.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.640
Morning, Ma'am.
It's not what you need on a Sunday.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.319
Any ID?
I'm afraid not.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.679
Oh, they must be frozen!

04:49.680 --> 04:51.839
Ma'am,
I'm with the girl who found him.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.279
She's not making much sense -
a hen party.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.799
Right, get her details.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.959
And tell them to go home
and sober up. Ma'am.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.799
Right, blues.
There you go.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.519
Aw,
it's the lass's wedding tomorrow.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.680
Today.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.920
Make sure you get some samples.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.759
Perfect.
Yep, and capture under the cheek.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.279
SHUTTER CLICKS

05:16.280 --> 05:18.199
Great. Thank you.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.639
Oh, you must be the new girl.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.199
Welcome aboard.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.279
And you are?

05:23.280 --> 05:26.679
No, don't tell me - Vera Stanhope.
No, love.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.719
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Vera Stanhope,

05:29.720 --> 05:33.079
I'm leading this investigation.
I've heard a lot about you.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.959
Well, then,
you have the advantage of me, love,

05:34.960 --> 05:36.360
cos I've heard nothing about you.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.439
Now, what are we looking at?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.320
Beaten to death?
When I know, you'll know.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.240
Are you gonna give me anything?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.919
His tooth has been broken,
presumably during the attack.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.799
The tooth pulp is still soft.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.759
I can't find any tooth fragments.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.919
I'm guessing they're in
his stomach contents.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.559
I'll find out later.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.639
I can smell significant alcohol.
I'll run the normal tests.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.599
Could be homeless.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.879
That's what I was thinking.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.320
There's a tattoo
on the right side of the neck.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.800
First Northumberland Regiment.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.519
Oh, in the army. Or was.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.800
That's got to help with his ID.
Also, this.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.239
Bailey.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.800
That could be his wife.
Or daughter.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.519
Any idea time of death?

06:25.520 --> 06:29.119
For now, I'd say he died no earlier
than 11pm, no later than 3am.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.959
I'll have more news
when I get him on the table.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.200
That's the best bit.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.599
Right, well, let me know
if you find anything useful.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.720
Of course.
That's literally my job.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.319
No, the fella's got no belongings
but could have been robbed.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.439
But we need to get an ID,
so start asking around

06:56.440 --> 06:58.039
and check the hostels

06:58.040 --> 07:00.159
and any agencies
that help the homeless.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.119
See if they can give us a name.
Ma'am.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.839
And, Jac, CCTV -
see what you can find.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.519
On it, Ma'am.
So, what do you want to do now?

07:07.520 --> 07:10.199
Well, I know what I want YOU to do.
I'm parched.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.280
Here.

TRAIN HORN BLARES

07:21.000 --> 07:23.159
Have you taken witness...

07:23.160 --> 07:24.800
Oh, hang on.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.239
Excuse me, love.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.999
Excuse me, sir.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.400
Er, do you know anything about this?

07:35.520 --> 07:36.639
What's going on?

07:36.640 --> 07:38.679
Well, a fella died.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.519
He'd been attacked, and we're
trying to find out his name.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.599
Any ideas?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.039
Well, how would I know?
I haven't been down.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.399
I just seen all this...

07:47.400 --> 07:51.519
Well, he's got a couple of tattoos
on his neck.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.479
A cannon and lion and "Bailey".

07:54.480 --> 07:56.240
I don't know him.
Ah.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.839
But I've seen him
at The Civvy Centre.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.719
You should ask the bloke
that runs it - Steve.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.239
Come on, Gary.
JAC: Ma'am.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.720
Look up The Civvy Centre.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.439
Ma'am, this is Finlay,
doorman at Chez Lounge. Possible ID.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.439
Er, I think his name
was Conn something.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.759
The homeless guy?
Mm.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.119
Aye, he used to hang around up there
a couple of nights a week

08:17.120 --> 08:18.840
watching the club.
He's nee bother, like.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.159
And was he up there last night?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.800
Well, I don't think so.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.559
Do you ever see him
with anyone else?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.479
PHONE BLEEPS
No. Look, sorry. I've got to go.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.879
No, you're all right, love.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.760
Just give your details
to my officer here.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.359
So, Conn - that's something.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.440
Just need to find a surname.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.479
Anything on there?
Yeah, Civvy Centre's nearby.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.399
It's a support centre
for the no-fixed-abode.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.639
Is it new?

08:46.640 --> 08:50.919
Started 18 months ago,
by ex-soldier Steve Wilson.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.720
Right. Well, come on,
let's get over there.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.719
So, imagine, you serve your country
and then die like that.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.639
That doesn't seem fair.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.399
No, you're right, it doesn't.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.520
It's all right, love,
we're not pushing in.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.040
Can you let us in, love?
Official business.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.720
Oh.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.919
Excuse me, love.
We're looking for Steve Wilson.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.199
This is our busy time.
Steve's cooking breakfast.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.079
You'll have to come back later.
VERA HUFFS

09:24.080 --> 09:26.599
Or you can talk to me.
And you are...?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.399
His cousin, Mandy. How can I help?

09:29.400 --> 09:33.040
Well, we need to talk to you
AND your cousin, love.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.360
Police to see you, Steve.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.999
You'll have to wait. I've got
people to feed. I can't stop.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.159
Do you have a client called Conn,
ex-army?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.399
Conn Burns? Yes.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.000
Well,
I'm afraid he's been found dead.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.479
How?

09:59.480 --> 10:01.120
Well, I can't say yet, love.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.759
Anything else, or is that it?

10:03.760 --> 10:06.080
Would you happen to have
his next of kin?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.319
Date of birth?

10:10.320 --> 10:12.160
I can get you that. Come with me.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.920
BANGING
Argh! Bloody hell.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.719
Sorry about Steve.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.119
It was our fundraiser last night.
We're tired.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.119
When was Conn last here?

10:29.120 --> 10:31.239
Yesterday. Late afternoon.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.599
How well did you know him?

10:33.600 --> 10:37.119
He was here most days,
volunteering for Steve.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.079
Doing what?

10:39.080 --> 10:40.320
Anything Steve needed.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.239
He just wanted to help.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.760
He said we saved his life,
gave him stability.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.199
I can't believe this has happened.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.559
He was such a good man.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.439
Mm. Well...

10:54.440 --> 10:55.960
sorry, pet.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.079
Wait.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
Ah, thanks, love.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.879
Run our victim through the system,
Kenny.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.800
Here's his details.
Yes, Ma'am.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.159
So, what are we up to?

11:20.160 --> 11:23.439
Well, I called the agencies
helping people with no fixed abode,

11:23.440 --> 11:25.599
but they said
he either never engaged with them

11:25.600 --> 11:27.399
or didn't fit their demographic.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.079
And the hostels didn't know him.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.519
SHE SIGHS
Jac, CCTV?

11:31.520 --> 11:33.239
It's a blind spot. No coverage.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.839
What?! The closest camera's
100 metres away.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.159
Well, see if you can pick him up
anywhere else.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.319
And put together a timeline.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.039
Ma'am?

11:43.040 --> 11:44.599
Connail Burns.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.999
He was admitted to Newcastle General
with pneumonia three years ago

11:49.000 --> 11:52.079
and he's named as his next of kin
a Teresa Burns.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.800
Right.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.440
Aiden?

12:24.560 --> 12:25.639
BELL RINGS

12:25.640 --> 12:29.280
This brings back memories
I'd rather forget.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.960
Bible classes as a bairn
at our local convent.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.839
It was great, they gave us sweets.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.359
But it was the chapped knees,

12:38.360 --> 12:41.480
waiting in the cold for me dad
to come and pick me up.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.120
We're here to see Teresa Burns,
Sister Michael?

13:15.920 --> 13:16.960
Sister.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.919
You wanted to see me?

13:19.920 --> 13:23.600
DS Healy, this is DCI Stanhope,
from Northumberland and City Police.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.480
Um... we're here about your brother,
Connail.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.439
I'm afraid he was found dead, love.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.960
Connail?

13:37.920 --> 13:38.999
What happened?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.600
He was the victim of an assault.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.159
Are you saying someone killed him?

13:44.160 --> 13:47.359
Well,
that's the theory we're working on.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.079
When?

13:49.080 --> 13:51.240
Last night, in Newcastle.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.439
Were you still in touch?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.279
He came start of every month.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.000
SHE PANTS AND SNIFFLES

14:02.080 --> 14:04.360
Now, I'm going to have to ask you...

14:05.840 --> 14:08.760
..does the name Bailey
mean anything to you?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.400
Sh-She was his daughter.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.319
You haven't told Kate?

14:16.320 --> 14:17.959
PHONE RINGS
Sorry.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.079
DC Healy.

14:19.080 --> 14:22.079
Who's Kate?
His wife.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.199
Bailey's mum.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.279
Do you mean his ex-wife?
Cos we have you as next of kin.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.160
No. They were still married.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.920
Ma'am? It's Paula.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.079
I'm... I'm afraid
we're going to have to go now, love,

14:39.080 --> 14:41.399
but if you'd like to give us
Kate's address,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.400
we'll make sure she's told.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.640
Oh, he's been through it,
has Connail.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.560
What's this?

14:55.600 --> 14:58.879
That looks like an old bullet wound.
Correct. From a few years ago.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.279
It's not important right now.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.919
More recently, I'd like to
draw your attention to these.

15:03.920 --> 15:04.999
It looks very likely

15:05.000 --> 15:07.799
that there were at least two
involved in the assault.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.039
One held his arms from behind,

15:10.040 --> 15:12.719
you can see the bruises
here and here,

15:12.720 --> 15:15.560
whilst the other beat him.
Excuse me.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.840
There's severe bruising
to the groin.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.159
And then someone dislocated
his left knee

15:25.160 --> 15:27.439
and stamped on his back so hard...

15:27.440 --> 15:29.120
they left a shoe print.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.959
He was an ex-drinker.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.719
His liver showed
significant cirrhosis,

15:36.720 --> 15:40.439
but even though he smelt of alcohol,
there was barely any in his system.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.599
I'd say what was there was forced.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.399
Hence the broken tooth.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.639
As suspected,
I found his tooth in his stomach.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.120
Now, after this attack,
he was left unconscious.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.079
What do you mean, THIS attack?

15:53.080 --> 15:54.719
He was attacked twice.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.039
Twice?
This was the first time.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.519
You can see that the bruising
started developing,

15:59.520 --> 16:01.079
which indicates that he was alive

16:01.080 --> 16:03.599
for probably around two hours
afterwards.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.719
He was first attacked about
five metres from where we found him.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.119
So he was moved?

16:08.120 --> 16:10.919
More likely he was crawling away
from something,

16:10.920 --> 16:12.399
or towards something,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.280
then was attacked again,
two hours later.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.560
It was very different.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.839
His scarf was held over
his mouth and nose.

16:21.840 --> 16:25.119
I found fibres inside both.
He was suffocated with it.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.759
Did he put up a fight?
I doubt it, no.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.879
He was already
considerably weakened.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.319
So whoever did this...

16:32.320 --> 16:34.119
came back to finish
what they started.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.879
We won't know that
until we get the DNA results back.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.879
But we do know when it happened,

16:39.880 --> 16:42.559
the first attack was between
nine and 11.

16:42.560 --> 16:46.159
The second, two hours later,
between 11pm and 1am.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.399
So you're saying we've got
two cases on our hands?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.880
Mm.
Finding out who attacked him...

16:53.080 --> 16:55.080
..then finding out who killed him.

17:01.480 --> 17:06.159
So, we have two investigations,
two attacks.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.199
The first involves
two or more people, who beat him up.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.999
The second attack,
approximately two hours later...

17:14.000 --> 17:18.039
I mean, most likely it was the same
people returning to finish the job.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.599
Or it could have been anyone.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.439
He was so severely weakened...

17:23.440 --> 17:24.879
a child could have done it.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.759
But make no mistake,
this was murder.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.959
So, what do we know about
Connail Burns?

17:29.960 --> 17:32.719
He was 38, born in Newcastle.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.679
Been in care since the age of seven.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.799
I called social services.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.239
They said he was kicked out of
a succession of kids' homes.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.679
He enlisted in the army
when he turned 17

17:41.680 --> 17:43.079
and he left in 2016.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.519
So a bit of a troublemaker?

17:44.520 --> 17:48.359
Well, he had an expired ASBO
from 2018 on his record,

17:48.360 --> 17:50.879
but that was it.
An ASBO. What was that for?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.679
To keep his distance
from his wife, Kate Burns.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.279
Apart from that, he's clean.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.559
He's never even been charged
under the Vagrancy Act.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.679
When did they get married?
Twenty years ago.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.399
Bailey arrived, er,
four years later. She's 15.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.280
So, why was he still married?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.280
More to the point...

18:12.640 --> 18:14.960
..why was she?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.079
AIDEN:
It's hard to believe he lived here.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.879
VERA: When did he move out? 2018?

18:20.880 --> 18:23.440
What a difference
four years can make, eh?

18:28.920 --> 18:32.280
Kate Burns?
Yeah. Er, Kate?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.760
Could we come inside, pet?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.199
What's all this about?

18:44.200 --> 18:47.999
I'm sorry, love.
It's about your husband, Connail.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.120
He's dead, isn't he?
I'm afraid so.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.719
I've been waiting for this
since we met,

18:54.720 --> 18:56.799
that knock at the door.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.519
Do you need me to identify him?
If that's something

18:59.520 --> 19:02.479
you're comfortable doing.
I should, I'm his next of kin.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.159
Well, we've got his sister down
as next of kin.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.679
Teresa? Oh, she's useless.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.200
No, course I'll do it.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.759
How did he die?

19:11.760 --> 19:14.239
He was fatally attacked.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.680
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

19:20.800 --> 19:22.079
What's happened to Dad?

19:22.080 --> 19:24.680
Bailey...
What's happened to him?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.680
Oh. Whoa.

19:29.640 --> 19:32.120
BAILEY SOBS
OK.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.359
I was surprised
you were still married.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.560
I didn't exactly have an address
for the divorce papers.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.040
I... I need some air.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.520
Hey.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.040
She needs you.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.360
WOMAN SIGHS
Poor Conn.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.679
AIDEN: So, you knew him?

19:58.680 --> 20:00.999
No. Erm...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I met Kate the year after he left.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.800
Pretty much picked up the pieces.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.720
Well, come on, love.
Help us out here.

20:11.720 --> 20:12.960
SHE SIGHS

20:18.040 --> 20:20.480
OK. So, you know he was in the army?

20:22.600 --> 20:25.279
Well, when he came out,
he got himself a job. And...

20:25.280 --> 20:27.720
he lost it, so he lied about it...

20:28.840 --> 20:32.079
..and he built up a mountain of debt
and lied about that.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.879
I mean... he was punching holes
in every wall.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.399
So he was violent?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.599
He really blew up. I mean...

20:39.600 --> 20:41.360
kicked the hell out of this place.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.760
Bailey saw it
and she was terrified.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.719
So he walked out.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.959
He left her.
Any communication since?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.279
No.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.759
BAILEY: I would like to know!

20:53.760 --> 20:55.679
KATE: I've told you
everything I can!

20:55.680 --> 20:57.999
Look, I'm gonna have to go up.
Sorry.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.799
Oh, right, love.
We'll let ourselves out.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.679
And tell Kate we'll be in touch
about IDing the body.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.879
Yeah.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.160
OK.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.199
DANCE MUSIC PLAYS

21:24.200 --> 21:25.559
MUSIC STOPS

21:25.560 --> 21:28.159
Hey, sorry, love.
We're looking for Steve.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.839
Yeah, he's, er...
he's fixing the lights outside.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.799
Right. You one of the volunteers
here, are you?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.119
Yeah.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.160
He's, er, helping me
get into college. Gonna be a chef.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.319
What's your name?
Tony.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.760
Tony what?

21:45.040 --> 21:46.520
Tony Castillo.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.959
Who are you?
Like, Christians or something?

21:49.960 --> 21:53.279
Er, no, this is DCI Stanhope
and I'm DS Healy,

21:53.280 --> 21:55.159
Northumberland and City Police.

21:55.160 --> 21:58.359
Er, do you know a fella
called Connail Burns?

21:58.360 --> 22:01.039
Had a couple of tattoos on his neck.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.199
No. Sorry. Don't know him.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.359
Hey, you crack on.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.239
Next stop, the Ritz.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.280
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY
Thanks, love.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.319
Oof!

22:16.320 --> 22:18.159
Jack of all trades.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.319
You have to when it's only you.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.079
Half our clients
didn't show up yesterday.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.759
Oh? Why's that?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.399
Because they knew
we'd had police in the building.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.479
Well, I'm sorry, love.
Nothing we can do about that

22:29.480 --> 22:32.040
cos this is now
a murder investigation.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.119
Murder? I didn't realise.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.599
How long's he been coming here?
Six months.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.839
First for food,
then classes, then volunteering.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.639
What was he like?

22:44.640 --> 22:47.559
Good man to have around. Solid.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.319
Well, had been.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.399
He was an alcoholic
but he'd been sober for months.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.039
"Had" been solid?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.440
So, what happened?

22:56.600 --> 23:00.279
He... kicked off
at the start of the week.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.519
He was meant to talk

23:01.520 --> 23:04.279
at the fundraiser on Saturday,
but pulled out.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.719
Did he give a reason why?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.880
Didn't say. It really cocked it up.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.599
He was gonna speak,
talk about how we'd helped him.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.079
Star guest.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.559
Ah, your cousin said you didn't
make your fundraising target.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.120
Barely even covered the costs.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.559
So, why'd he kick off?

23:23.560 --> 23:27.159
I dunno. He'd spent months
getting a flat with another client

23:27.160 --> 23:28.840
and pulled of that, too, on Monday.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.760
OK, right. Now, can you give us
the name of this other client?

23:34.840 --> 23:36.040
Tony Castillo.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.999
He's done a runner.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.719
Now, why would he do
a daft thing like that?

23:52.720 --> 23:53.759
You're police.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.279
So did he have something
to do with Connail's death?

23:56.280 --> 23:58.639
No! Tony hero-worshipped him.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.879
So why didn't Conn
want to live with him?

24:00.880 --> 24:04.200
You'll have to ask Tony.
Where's your cousin?

24:10.800 --> 24:12.279
Where's Tony?

24:12.280 --> 24:14.439
Tony?
He left a couple of minutes ago.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.480
Oh.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.399
Now, he told us
he didn't know Conn.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.719
Well, that's rubbish.
They were due to move in together.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.199
Yeah.
So, why did he pull out of that?

24:24.200 --> 24:26.920
Don't know. Tony was gutted.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.519
It's a two-bed flat.
It fell through without Conn.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.759
Yeah, and when was this?
Monday.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.439
Already had a bad start to the week.
Why's that?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.159
Someone nicked a donation tin.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.519
Happens a lot, does it, theft?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.599
Not really. Too scared of Steve.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.120
Wouldn't want to disappoint him.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.959
Who else was Conn mates with?

24:45.960 --> 24:48.839
He got on with Benny,
looked out for him.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.519
Benny. Have you got a photo?

24:51.520 --> 24:54.919
Doubt it. Erm...
might have one of his little mate.

24:54.920 --> 24:55.960
What?

24:57.640 --> 24:59.919
The fella with the dog.
Mm.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.720
Now, why would he say
he didn't know Conn?

25:03.760 --> 25:04.879
He's scared.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.159
Most of their encounters
with the police

25:07.160 --> 25:09.079
end up with them arrested.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.600
They operate from a place of fear.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.120
Can you get the footage
from when Conn was last here?

25:16.280 --> 25:19.199
Who's he shouting at?
No idea. I was upstairs.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.639
Where was Steve?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.320
At the hotel for the fundraiser.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.999
Is it possible Conn could have
stolen that donation tin?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.399
He wasn't around
the weekend before last.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.480
But it could have gone missing
on the Friday.

25:34.680 --> 25:35.760
Maybe he did.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.159
Right.

25:39.160 --> 25:43.479
I want this Tony Castillo found,
top priority.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.399
Kenny, run Tony through the system.
And while you're at it,

25:46.400 --> 25:49.519
do a background check on that fella
who runs The Civvy Centre,

25:49.520 --> 25:52.399
Steve Wilson. I mean, why did
Connail not go to that fundraiser?

25:52.400 --> 25:54.799
He told Mandy the place
saved his life, so what changed?

25:54.800 --> 25:58.279
And, Mark, do some checks
into his missus, Kate Burns.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.519
There's something not right there.
Ma'am.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.719
Yeah, I don't understand
why she didn't divorce him

26:02.720 --> 26:05.079
if she's got an ASBO on him.
Yeah, exactly.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.239
So, where are we on his timeline,
Jac?

26:07.240 --> 26:09.799
He stayed in the city centre
until late afternoon,

26:09.800 --> 26:11.439
when he disappeared for three hours.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.520
There's a couple of things
I'd like to show you.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.240
This was yesterday lunchtime.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.319
Hm. Now, would you look at that?
He's chasing a mugger.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.760
Good lad!

26:25.120 --> 26:29.039
And this was some time later.
What's that, an estate agent's?

26:29.040 --> 26:30.880
Yeah, Hawthorn and Son.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.280
Now, what was he doing in there?

26:40.840 --> 26:43.039
So I'm obviously gonna make sure
that next time,

26:43.040 --> 26:44.879
I'm not gonna be
in that situation, am I?

26:44.880 --> 26:47.239
Yeah, OK, whatever.
But it's not what I was saying.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.479
Rae...

26:48.480 --> 26:50.200
Whoa!

26:51.200 --> 26:53.319
Huh! Unhappy customer?

26:53.320 --> 26:56.479
Well, if you don't pay for your
flat, you can't live in it, can you?

26:56.480 --> 26:57.919
How can I help you?

26:57.920 --> 27:00.279
Er, DCI Stanhope, DS Healy.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.759
Oh. Not looking for a three-bed

27:01.760 --> 27:03.280
with a river view, then?
HE CHUCKLES

27:04.640 --> 27:08.799
Now, we're wondering
if anyone knew this fella, love.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.319
Believe he came in here about 5pm,
day before yesterday.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.319
Yeah, he, er...

27:14.320 --> 27:16.639
he wanted me to give him some money
to not sit outside.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.839
Extortion. Why?

27:17.840 --> 27:20.119
Well, cos he's been murdered, love.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.480
Found yesterday morning.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.199
So, did you see him again
after he came in here?

27:26.200 --> 27:27.959
No. That was the only time
that I saw him.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.759
Oh, the only time?
Yeah.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.279
Apart from him sitting in
your doorway, you mean?

27:32.280 --> 27:33.999
Well, er...

27:34.000 --> 27:35.519
Sorry, didn't catch your name.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.639
Oh, it's Alexander Hawthorn.
This is my dad's agency.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.920
Ah, course it is.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.640
Well, if you think of anything,
love...

27:47.040 --> 27:48.120
Will do.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.480
Don't believe a word he said.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.999
I'm going with Kate Burns
to ID her husband's body,

28:07.000 --> 28:08.879
so I'll be quick.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.999
I want to know everything about
this fella, Alexander Hawthorn.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.319
If he blows his nose, I want
the tissue, and I'm not joking.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.639
Backtrack his movements on CCTV.

28:19.640 --> 28:22.919
Let's see if he crossed paths
with Connail Burns.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.319
And where are we with The
Civvy Centre fella, Steve Wilson?

28:25.320 --> 28:29.639
He left the forces in 2012,
decorated multiple times.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.519
Ended up no fixed abode, 2013.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.599
But according to this,

28:33.600 --> 28:35.839
he turned his life round
and opened up The Civvy Centre.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.359
And it's all above board? Legit?

28:38.360 --> 28:41.279
Far as I know.
Where'd he get the money?

28:41.280 --> 28:43.599
He set it up with an inheritance
from his grandmother.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.999
Got charitable status last year.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.159
And what's his reputation like?

28:47.160 --> 28:50.719
Local agencies were impressed.
Said he's a one-man machine.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.679
Looks like the only help he's got
is his cousin.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.999
I followed up on what Conn's wife's
partner said to you.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.919
He went to work at a local
fulfilment centre but got sacked.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.519
What? More troublemaking?

29:01.520 --> 29:04.519
Well, the manager said he was sacked
for being drunk at work.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.839
Well, we've all been there.
Haven't we, Kenny?

29:07.840 --> 29:08.999
I looked into his finances.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.199
He ran up £18,000 of debt,
plus interest.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.319
Did he?
Kate took it on.

29:14.320 --> 29:18.559
Now, why would she do that
and then land him with an ASBO?

29:18.560 --> 29:20.280
Well, backs up what the partner
said.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.239
And how are we doing
with the elusive Tony and Benny?

29:25.240 --> 29:27.319
Any sightings?
Nah, they're both lying low.

29:27.320 --> 29:30.640
All right, well, crack on.
Impress me, eh?

29:33.960 --> 29:35.280
VERA: Ready?

29:43.680 --> 29:45.280
That's Connail Burns.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.360
No, not just yet, please.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.999
Are you OK, pet?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.040
I thought I wouldn't recognise him,
but...

30:04.440 --> 30:06.280
..he looks the same.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.960
I loved you.

30:14.960 --> 30:18.079
Conn had been in the army
two years when we met.

30:18.080 --> 30:22.279
He was handsome. Sexy.
Always did the right thing.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.799
And what was he like
when he left the army?

30:25.800 --> 30:27.800
He couldn't cope.

30:30.720 --> 30:34.040
He wouldn't talk about it.
Just drank.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.879
Said that's what he'd been
told to do if he felt too much.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.319
Drink.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.799
And he ran up some debts,
is that right?

30:43.800 --> 30:46.079
That's what we argued about
the night he left.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.679
He didn't want me to know
he'd lost his job.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.639
Cos he was ashamed.

30:51.640 --> 30:55.039
He saw how scared we were
and walked out.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.559
Ah, well, that can't have been easy.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.359
I couldn't do it without Liv.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.999
She and Bailey seem close.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.840
Yeah.

31:05.560 --> 31:08.839
I think Bailey likes her more
than she likes me.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.799
Well, I can't believe that.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.520
I should just be grateful...

31:13.520 --> 31:15.600
..Liv signed up
to the whole package.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.840
So, where were you
on Saturday night?

31:21.840 --> 31:24.280
Home. Waiting to pick Bailey up.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.880
She called about midnight.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.800
And what about your partner?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.520
We ask everyone, love.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.959
She was at work, in Sunderland.
What does she do?

31:37.960 --> 31:40.959
Head of security for a local firm.
Night work.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.919
And where are you?
Dayton Hospice. Care assistant.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.639
PHONE RINGS
Well, that must be rewarding.

31:47.640 --> 31:48.680
Excuse me, love.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.520
Yep?

31:52.600 --> 31:54.080
And where is he?

32:13.520 --> 32:15.559
Hello, Tony.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.119
What are you doing?

32:17.120 --> 32:21.039
Oh, a bit of a disappearing act
you played on us earlier.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.279
You said you didn't know Conn.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.319
I meant he wasn't my mate.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.879
Yeah? Well, Steve Wilson told us

32:25.880 --> 32:27.919
you and Conn
were getting a flat together.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.719
So you must've been close once.

32:30.720 --> 32:34.120
I thought we were, yeah.
So, why'd he pull out, hmm?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.879
Don't know. He was on one.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.359
He went away the weekend before last
and come back different.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.479
What d'you mean, "different"?

32:41.480 --> 32:43.959
He was normally
all over Steve like a rash,

32:43.960 --> 32:45.959
but he was angry at him.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.800
Said you couldn't trust
anyone in the army.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.320
They nearly had a fight.
When was this?

32:53.120 --> 32:54.720
Last Monday.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.039
What do you think of Steve?

32:58.040 --> 33:02.040
I wouldn't wanna argue with him.
Took some balls to do what Conn did.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.439
He wasn't... He wasn't scared...

33:05.440 --> 33:08.719
You all right, mate?
Sorry, I-I need the bogs.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.239
Yeah, you go.
We'll wait here for you.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.519
Don't you... Go with him!
What? He's gonna be sick on me!

33:12.520 --> 33:15.199
Well, he's gonna leg it again!
He's left his stuff here.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.199
Excuse me,
they belong to somebody else.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.919
Donations.
Oh. Where are the toilets?

33:19.920 --> 33:22.760
Up there.
Brilliant (!) Tony!

33:32.320 --> 33:34.999
Well, shall I get Steve Wilson in?
Oh, what do you think?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.279
Yes, Ma'am.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.199
I've dug deeper
into The Civvy Centre accounts.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.719
They've got cashflow problems.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.799
The whole place could close
in two months.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.559
So it's on shaky ground?

33:44.560 --> 33:46.440
I'm surprised
it hasn't fallen over already.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.480
Thanks, Jac.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.159
Do I need a solicitor with me?
We haven't charged you.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.319
Yeah. Should we?

33:59.320 --> 34:00.999
Oh, we found Tony.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.399
Now, he told us you and Conn
nearly had a fight last week.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.799
That was Conn kicking off, not me.
I just wanted him to calm down.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.359
Why?

34:09.360 --> 34:12.360
Ah, c'mon, Steve. Throw us a bone.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.079
I don't know. He was paranoid.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.439
He said he didn't trust
anyone in the army.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.839
He pulled out of the flat.
He pulled out of the fundraiser.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.319
He was on self-destruct.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.359
I think he was scared
about being normal again.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.639
Wasn't that what he wanted?
I'm not saying it makes any sense.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.879
I've seen it a few times. I did it.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.439
I just didn't think
Conn would do it.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.079
I hear you've only got funding
for another couple of months?

34:41.080 --> 34:43.279
What's that got to do with anything?

34:43.280 --> 34:47.199
I met some entrepreneurs
who wanna invest. Tax reasons.

34:47.200 --> 34:48.240
We'll be fine.

34:50.680 --> 34:53.800
Why'd you do it, Steve?
Run that Civvy Centre?

34:54.800 --> 34:58.439
It's exhausting,
takes up all your time,

34:58.440 --> 34:59.919
your clients kicking off.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.240
Because I know what it's like.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.760
When I left the forces,
I started drinking.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.440
I had no-one to tell me to stop.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.920
If me nana hadn't dragged me
off the streets, I'd be dead.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.079
I wanna be that person
for other people.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.359
I thought that's what he wanted,
too.

35:19.360 --> 35:23.280
He said he wanted to help
at the centre. Share the load.

35:24.480 --> 35:28.239
Do you think he'd ever
extort money out of anyone?

35:28.240 --> 35:31.599
No way. No... Who said that?

35:31.600 --> 35:35.359
Ah. Someone said he wanted paying
not to sleep in their doorway.

35:35.360 --> 35:39.279
Conn wouldn't do that.
He didn't sleep in town, anyway.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.359
Didn't he? Where'd he sleep?

35:42.360 --> 35:45.719
I don't know,
but he didn't sleep in hostels.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.399
He didn't like the aggro.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.559
Right, you can go.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.280
Interview terminated 17:02.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.479
Mark, can you check
Steve Wilson's alibi?

36:00.480 --> 36:02.719
That fundraiser he was holding?

36:02.720 --> 36:04.839
Ma'am.
Aiden.

36:04.840 --> 36:10.120
Both he and Tony mentioned
Conn kicking off about the army.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.319
Have we got an army contact?

36:12.320 --> 36:14.119
Yeah, I've got one.
I'll see if they can help.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.399
Ma'am. Benny's been spotted.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.520
Where?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.440
Benny?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.920
Just want a chat, love.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.960
Benny?

37:03.800 --> 37:05.040
Benny?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.759
DOG WHIMPERING

37:09.760 --> 37:11.600
Oh, hello, pet.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.160
Thought you might be hungry.
Brought you a snack.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.480
Cup of tea?

37:22.040 --> 37:24.519
What's your dog's name?
Gary.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.160
Would Gary like a treat?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.920
He is a bit hungry, aye.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.879
There's a good boy.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.920
Here. Here.

37:38.640 --> 37:42.880
We're here about Connail Burns,
but you've already guessed that.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.799
Now, why didn't you tell us
you knew him?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.560
Would've saved us a lot of time.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.239
How long you been on the streets?
Sixteen year.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.479
Do you know how Conn died?

37:58.480 --> 37:59.880
Yeah.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.879
Two blokes beat him up.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.920
How d'you know that?

38:10.520 --> 38:12.799
That place where he was attacked.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.039
Was that a regular haunt of his?

38:15.040 --> 38:18.159
Me and Conn used to go there
when we needed a bit of shuteye.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.039
So that's what you were doing,

38:20.040 --> 38:24.199
going for a bit of shuteye,
when you saw something?

38:24.200 --> 38:26.080
And that's why you're hiding here.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.199
We can protect you, Benny.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.399
Stop them from doing it again
to someone else.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.360
I didn't see anything!

38:39.080 --> 38:42.000
Well, if you change your mind...

38:45.720 --> 38:50.239
Oh, just one question
and we'll leave you in peace.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.599
Conn went away somewhere
weekend before last.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.959
Do you know where he went?
Ask Rae. She'll know.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.239
Rae?
Some young thing.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.999
Spiky on the outside,
soft in the middle.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.639
Conn used to look out for her.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.479
Here, d'you know
where we can find her?

39:04.480 --> 39:08.560
If I give you her address,
you'd better not tell her it was me.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.639
My mate says that Conn's
ex-staff sergeant

39:12.640 --> 39:14.159
is recruiting at the university.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.600
Great, let's doorstep him.

39:25.360 --> 39:28.079
Hi, we're looking for
Warrant Officer Sharpe?

39:28.080 --> 39:29.440
How can I help you?

39:32.440 --> 39:33.920
He was on the streets?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.760
Conn was one of the best soldiers
I've served with.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.480
I can't believe it.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.680
When did you serve together?

39:45.080 --> 39:47.159
His first two tours of Afghanistan.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.559
2003 to 2010.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.799
I was staff sergeant,
and he was lance corporal.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.320
So you knew him well?

39:54.840 --> 39:59.319
He was a diamond. Solid.
Totally trustworthy.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.359
You knew he'd always have your back.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.559
And he loved it.
He loved being a soldier.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.039
So it was important to him?

40:07.040 --> 40:10.479
I always thought
he'd become a sergeant.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.600
He had great potential.
So, what changed?

40:15.240 --> 40:17.559
Once I left, I lost contact.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.320
But we saw horrific things
out there.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.759
Just before I left,
we had an incident...

40:22.760 --> 40:24.759
What?

40:24.760 --> 40:28.519
A bus full of Afghans,
civilian staff and their kids,

40:28.520 --> 40:30.599
heading into base.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.880
Only they had a suicide bomber
on board.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.480
They blew it up just before
it got inside the gates.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.200
I worked with Conn's section
to evacuate everyone.

40:43.840 --> 40:47.520
We had to deal with what was...
left behind.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.199
It was the worst day of my life.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.719
It affected all of us,
especially Conn.

40:53.720 --> 40:56.999
He had to pick up the pieces
of this girl,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.840
same age as his daughter.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.119
Tell me about the others
in his section.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.919
Called themselves "the ten".

41:05.920 --> 41:09.759
Very tight. Proper band of brothers.
Have you talked to them?

41:09.760 --> 41:11.639
No, we haven't got their details.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.439
We're getting push back
from the regiment.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.559
They're not being helpful.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.479
Should go in person.
Bit harder to ignore.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.039
Yeah?

41:20.040 --> 41:23.279
Conn was very close to Sam Gastrell.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.199
Had similar backgrounds.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.439
PHONE VIBRATING

41:27.440 --> 41:29.439
Sorry,
our next talk is due to start.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.240
Ah, right. Well, thanks.
Thanks for your help.

41:35.760 --> 41:39.239
Ma'am, CCTV on the night Conn died
shows a man following him.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.959
It's Alexander Hawthorn,
the estate agent. And?

41:41.960 --> 41:43.679
He was joined by another bloke,

41:43.680 --> 41:46.399
and they tailed him
around the city centre.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.480
Right.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.479
Hey, hey, hey! Alexander Hawthorn,
what have you got?

41:53.480 --> 41:57.359
Erm, he was reported for harassment
a couple of months ago, Ma'am.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.279
But the claimant
dropped the accusation.

41:59.280 --> 42:03.119
So we've got no prints or DNA?
No, Ma'am. Great.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.119
Yeah, I've been through
his social media, Ma'am.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.279
He was out Saturday night
with a mate.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.119
Now, he posted these
around seven thirty...

42:10.120 --> 42:12.880
and then these ones were later,
around 2am.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.319
Who's that fella with him?

42:16.320 --> 42:19.239
Shaun Kerny, works for him
at the estate agent's.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.359
Bit of a tough nut by all accounts,
but nothing on file.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.599
Now, why would they both
have changed their shirts

42:25.600 --> 42:27.280
at that time of night?

42:37.720 --> 42:40.439
Alexander Hawthorn,
I'm arresting you on suspicion

42:40.440 --> 42:43.599
of the murder of Connail Burns...
Shaun Kerny, I'm arresting you...

42:43.600 --> 42:45.279
I told you, he wanted money.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.119
And I don't believe you, love.
Try again.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.199
How did you know Connail Burns?

42:50.200 --> 42:53.119
I don't know what type of people
you think I associate with

42:53.120 --> 42:57.520
but they're not off the streets.
Oh, so, why were you following him?

43:00.120 --> 43:01.839
Well, that's just a coincidence.

43:01.840 --> 43:05.799
Well, it's a bit of a stretch
to call it a coincidence, love,

43:05.800 --> 43:10.440
when you and your mate are still
following him 30 minutes later.

43:11.480 --> 43:15.079
Where were you on Saturday,
between 11pm and 1am?

43:15.080 --> 43:17.719
I went back to my flat,
to freshen up.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.999
And why was that? Er,
someone spilt beer on my t-shirt.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.680
Mm, they spill it
on your mate's t-shirt, too?

43:24.920 --> 43:27.879
Can anyone verify
you went back to your flat,

43:27.880 --> 43:29.959
besides your mate,
who we've arrested?

43:29.960 --> 43:32.600
Well, the concierge
on the front desk of my building.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.360
What you thinking?

43:38.160 --> 43:42.759
What's the connection between
that poncy estate agent

43:42.760 --> 43:45.279
and Connail Burns?

43:45.280 --> 43:47.160
They're from different worlds.

43:48.640 --> 43:52.479
But I'd lay money it was him
and his mate who beat him up.

43:52.480 --> 43:55.080
And went back a second time
to make sure.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.319
Why? Mark's still checking
Hawthorn's alibi.

44:00.320 --> 44:05.560
Kenny said there was an accusation
against him dropped. When was that?

44:11.680 --> 44:13.200
Well, I'll be blowed.

44:14.600 --> 44:18.320
Look who it was accused him
of harassment.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.879
Rae Jenson? Could that be
the same Rae that Benny mentioned?

44:22.880 --> 44:26.159
I don't know. But it's witnessed
by "Connell" Burns.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.559
His name's spelt wrong.
Well, who cares!

44:28.560 --> 44:31.120
There's our connection. Come on.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.640
Good work, Kenny!

44:41.360 --> 44:44.399
How much would one of these
set you back a month?

44:44.400 --> 44:47.920
At least a couple of grand.
How can the lass afford that?

44:51.120 --> 44:52.760
KNOCKING ON DOOR

44:54.960 --> 44:57.319
Thanks for letting us up, love.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.319
We're here about your mate,
Connail Burns.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.519
I don't know where he is, sorry.
Why are you asking?

45:02.520 --> 45:05.999
Well, that's not a conversation
to have like this, love.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.480
Can we come inside?

45:13.360 --> 45:18.599
Ah, now, we're sorry to be
the bearers of bad news, love.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.559
What, about Conn?
Mm.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.879
I'm afraid he was found dead.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.519
He'd been fatally attacked,

45:24.520 --> 45:27.840
and we're trying to find out
who is responsible.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.720
I'm sorry.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.999
SNIFFLES

45:34.000 --> 45:36.639
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt Conn?

45:36.640 --> 45:38.600
No.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.080
When did you last see him?

45:42.840 --> 45:44.760
Saturday. Around four.

45:46.520 --> 45:49.840
I wouldn't let him in.
And did he give you the black eye?

45:51.320 --> 45:53.439
What, Conn? No!

45:53.440 --> 45:56.119
But he'd have seen it.
Did he ask you who did that?

45:56.120 --> 45:58.119
I walked into a door.

45:58.120 --> 46:02.119
Or was it the fella you reported
once before who did it?

46:02.120 --> 46:05.239
We saw you with him yesterday
in the estate agent's.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.359
Why were you arguing?

46:06.360 --> 46:09.560
He's my landlord.
He says my lease has expired.

46:10.920 --> 46:14.520
And what's your relationship
with him?

46:15.840 --> 46:18.359
My landlord.
Mm.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.879
Did he know Conn?

46:19.880 --> 46:23.640
No, of course not. No.

46:31.120 --> 46:34.199
Mark, I need you to persuade Benny

46:34.200 --> 46:37.799
to come in and identify Hawthorn
and his mate.

46:37.800 --> 46:42.120
Take Kenny with you.
But tell him to be gentle. Ma'am.

46:44.360 --> 46:48.719
Oh, just stroll in, why don't you?
So, you don't want your DNA results?

46:48.720 --> 46:51.199
Thought I'd deliver them personally.
Oh, and...?

46:51.200 --> 46:52.719
There are two clear DNA profiles

46:52.720 --> 46:54.519
that correspond
to where he was attacked,

46:54.520 --> 46:56.799
which match your suspects.
Great!

46:56.800 --> 46:58.959
But, and that's why I'm here,

46:58.960 --> 47:01.239
there's a third DNA profile
unidentified.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.479
And it's the only DNA
apart from the victim's

47:03.480 --> 47:05.999
on the murder weapon.
His scarf?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.919
This third person
is not on our system.

47:08.920 --> 47:12.479
I want to be clear, if you try
to prosecute either of the two men

47:12.480 --> 47:14.479
you are currently holding
for murder,

47:14.480 --> 47:15.720
I won't back you in court.

47:18.440 --> 47:21.839
What I mean to say is,
you can't say it's job done.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.479
Well, why would I? Cos you've just
told us there's a third person.

47:25.480 --> 47:29.079
I'm not a corner cutter.
Good, cos neither am I.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.639
Good.
Great.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.279
This was a brutal attack...

47:34.280 --> 47:39.080
and yours and your mate's DNA
are all over the deceased.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.400
Anything to say?

47:42.680 --> 47:44.399
Well, let me put it this way...

47:44.400 --> 47:47.799
Did you force a bottle
into his mouth so hard,

47:47.800 --> 47:50.840
you broke a tooth?
No comment.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.399
Why were you following him?
No comment.

47:55.400 --> 47:58.399
Ah, come on, love.
We know you beat him up.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.640
I just want to know why.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.360
OK, let me tell you what I think.

48:07.200 --> 48:11.399
I think Conn found out you'd given
your girlfriend a shiner

48:11.400 --> 48:13.679
and he came in to tell you
to leave her alone.

48:13.680 --> 48:16.520
That's not my girlfriend.
Or was.

48:17.480 --> 48:20.639
Put her up in one of your flats.
Rae didn't tell you that.

48:20.640 --> 48:24.479
So Conn comes in
to warn you off Rae,

48:24.480 --> 48:27.600
and you call in some muscle.

48:29.760 --> 48:35.039
Listen, sunshine, we've got your DNA
all over a murder victim!

48:35.040 --> 48:36.679
Oof, the jury'll love that.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.519
What, a murder case,
all that evidence?

48:38.520 --> 48:40.640
Only take them an hour!
Look, I didn't kill him.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.319
He was alive when we left him.

48:45.320 --> 48:49.240
Oh, so you just beat him
unconscious, did you?

48:52.320 --> 48:55.560
I need to hear you say it.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.960
Yes.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.319
Hawthorn's admitted to assault.
His mate's admitted it, too.

49:03.320 --> 49:07.439
Oh, hello, Gary! Good boy.
Ma'am. Benny ID'd both of 'em.

49:07.440 --> 49:10.119
He said they left the scene
at ten thirty.

49:10.120 --> 49:14.679
Alibis? They entered Hawthorn's flat
at ten forty-five

49:14.680 --> 49:16.359
and went back out clubbing
at ten to one.

49:16.360 --> 49:17.959
They could still have done it.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.759
It'd be tight
but a jury could buy it.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.919
Do you know, I hate to say it,

49:21.920 --> 49:25.759
but I don't think it was them
who suffocated him.

49:25.760 --> 49:30.079
You heard what Paula said,
their DNA is all over the body,

49:30.080 --> 49:32.319
but NOT on that scarf.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.360
So we've solved who it was
beat him up...

49:35.520 --> 49:38.960
..but we haven't got a clue
who finished him off.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.279
Look, we've had two people now

49:43.280 --> 49:47.119
who said he turned
against the army, right?

49:47.120 --> 49:49.719
Now, how are we doing
with his section's contact details?

49:49.720 --> 49:52.199
It's like getting blood
out of a stone.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.879
Quoting the Official Secrets Act.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.319
D'you know, well...

49:55.320 --> 49:57.639
Do what that warrant officer
suggested.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.279
Get over to the regiment in person.

50:00.280 --> 50:02.639
Make some noise.
Get him to go with you.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.599
And don't come back
without those addresses.

50:04.600 --> 50:05.799
Why don't you come with me?

50:05.800 --> 50:09.279
Because I'm going to find out
where he went last weekend.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.880
Is that all right with you?
Ma'am.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.280
Yeah, I know you and Conn
were close.

50:15.720 --> 50:16.919
How did you meet?

50:16.920 --> 50:20.599
I stayed in a women's hostel
when I first came here.

50:20.600 --> 50:24.079
Only one of the women there
said that I was a threat.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.559
Erm... "not a real woman".

50:26.560 --> 50:29.679
VERA TUTS
I had to go to a men's hostel.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.400
And things got a bit ugly.

50:32.840 --> 50:33.999
Conn stepped in.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.999
Well, you shouldn't
have been there, love.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.039
A men's hostel's
no place for a lass.

50:38.040 --> 50:40.759
Conn was like a dad to me.

50:40.760 --> 50:44.119
You're just about the same age
as Conn's daughter.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.240
It broke his heart
he couldn't see her.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.200
I was a stand-in.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.959
He was such a good man.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.880
Now you listen to me.

50:57.040 --> 51:00.320
You think you're in love
with this fella, this Alexander?

51:01.320 --> 51:04.119
I am.
He loves me, too, in his way.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.479
No, he doesn't.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.879
I've heard him talk.

51:07.880 --> 51:11.559
Yeah, well, he's just scared what
his friends would think, I get it.

51:11.560 --> 51:14.839
He's admitted he beat up Conn.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.199
He smashed his teeth in,
he broke his knee,

51:17.200 --> 51:19.240
and he punched him black and blue.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.279
Now then.

51:23.280 --> 51:25.759
Benny, fella with the dog,

51:25.760 --> 51:30.559
he told me you might know where
Conn went the weekend before last?

51:30.560 --> 51:33.199
He, erm, he had to go away,

51:33.200 --> 51:35.679
and he came here
to get washed and changed.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.479
And he wore this posh suit
from a charity shop.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.479
Where did he have to go?

51:40.480 --> 51:42.000
The funeral of an army mate.

51:43.360 --> 51:46.319
There's only seven of them left.
He said they were like family.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.880
I think his name was... Jack?

52:09.320 --> 52:12.599
Afternoon.
Thanks for meeting at short notice.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.240
You're welcome. Let's go.

52:18.280 --> 52:19.519
Are you with them yet?

52:19.520 --> 52:22.359
We're just waiting for Lieutenant
Colonel Hillier to arrive.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.039
He went to the funeral
of one of his section

52:25.040 --> 52:26.959
the weekend before he died.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.479
Find out who it was.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.520
'Jack somebody.'
Will do.

52:32.040 --> 52:35.239
You do realise we're getting ready
to leave on manoeuvres?

52:35.240 --> 52:37.880
You do realise
this is a murder investigation?

52:38.840 --> 52:41.519
Gentlemen, let's not waste time.

52:41.520 --> 52:44.760
So, Lance Corporal Connail Burns.

52:46.360 --> 52:49.239
He left in 2016,

52:49.240 --> 52:51.639
following an accident
with his firearm.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.999
And that's the left shoulder injury?
Correct.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.479
Do you have the details
for Private Sam Gastrell, Ma'am?

52:56.480 --> 52:57.719
They were close.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.759
Private Gastrell killed himself
shortly before the unit came home.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.599
Sam did? Why?

53:03.600 --> 53:07.719
He stole a pair of sunglasses
from one of our dead soldiers.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.919
He was facing
disciplinary procedure,

53:09.920 --> 53:11.839
a possible sentence.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.959
He killed himself over sunglasses?

53:13.960 --> 53:16.319
If you can't trust a fellow soldier
with your belongings,

53:16.320 --> 53:18.119
how can you trust them
to have your back?

53:18.120 --> 53:19.559
With all due respect, Ma'am,

53:19.560 --> 53:22.279
that doesn't sound
like something Sam would do.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.719
It was witnessed
by Corporal Dominic Charlton,

53:24.720 --> 53:28.399
Private Jack Swanson
and Lance Corporal Connail Burns.

53:28.400 --> 53:31.679
Private Gastrell
had claimed he was innocent,

53:31.680 --> 53:35.359
been restricted to barracks
whilst his section were on patrol.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.599
Then he killed himself.
That's horrific.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.639
Petty theft
may sound trivial to you,

53:39.640 --> 53:41.080
but loyalty is everything to us.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.559
Now, I understand
that Lance Corporal Burns

53:45.560 --> 53:46.999
didn't have an exit interview?

53:47.000 --> 53:50.479
So no PTSD counselling?
After everything he'd been through?

53:50.480 --> 53:53.959
He didn't request one.
Doesn't affect everyone.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.480
It affects them and everyone
they come into contact with.

53:57.440 --> 54:01.359
It's why he was living rough
after three tours of Afghanistan.

54:01.360 --> 54:04.239
It's why he left his family.
We know it's an issue,

54:04.240 --> 54:06.919
but we can't make people
go to counselling.

54:06.920 --> 54:08.839
He wasn't even offered it.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.880
I'll take his section's details.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.520
I think we're done here.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.960
Warrant Officer Sharpe,
if you would wait.

54:22.440 --> 54:25.719
Aiden, the lass just told me
where Conn lived.

54:25.720 --> 54:28.279
'And I've found the Jack
whose funeral Conn went to.'

54:28.280 --> 54:31.399
Great. Now meet me on the south side
of Laskey Bridge.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.760
I'll be there
as soon as I can, Ma'am.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.999
Get in trouble?
I'm a subordinate, and so are you.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.039
Well, I'm not in the army,
and she needed to hear it.

54:40.040 --> 54:43.079
She did.
The contact details she gave us

54:43.080 --> 54:45.040
are five years out of date
for a start.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.479
Let me get the information
for Dom Charlton and Jack Swanson.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.959
OK.

54:49.960 --> 54:53.000
Thank you.
You're welcome.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.360
SHE GASPS

55:34.080 --> 55:35.919
What the hell?!

55:35.920 --> 55:37.840
HE PANTS

55:39.600 --> 55:42.880
Are you OK?
Never mind me, get after him!

55:44.000 --> 55:45.200
Tony!

55:48.840 --> 55:50.080
Tony!

55:59.360 --> 56:02.119
THEY GROAN

56:02.120 --> 56:03.600
Gotcha.

56:14.280 --> 56:16.439
RADIO CHATTER

56:16.440 --> 56:17.919
SIREN BLARES

56:17.920 --> 56:21.120
Well, go on.
Let's see what he was after.

56:24.880 --> 56:27.079
Ah, look.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.320
All he wanted was home and family.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.559
What's in that bag?

56:32.560 --> 56:34.720
RATTLING
What's that rattle?

56:37.440 --> 56:39.999
Oh.
So that's what Tony was after.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.600
Unless he was hiding it.

56:43.560 --> 56:46.039
This went missing
from The Civvy Centre.

56:46.040 --> 56:48.279
We found it in Conn's belongings.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.639
He must have stolen it, then.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.919
Look, we're not daft, pet.
Your prints are all over it.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.520
We know it was you who stole it.

56:55.480 --> 56:56.720
I couldn't open it.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.039
I asked him to help,
but it backfired.

57:00.040 --> 57:04.320
And that's why he changed his mind
about living with you, isn't it?

57:05.920 --> 57:08.199
Must've upset you when he said that.

57:08.200 --> 57:10.359
He knew I needed it.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.959
He knew that
if I could get the flat,

57:12.960 --> 57:14.719
I could go college,
train to be a chef,

57:14.720 --> 57:16.959
and see my son again.
That's all I wanted.

57:16.960 --> 57:19.279
But he took it all away for this?

57:19.280 --> 57:21.160
And what did Conn want?

57:22.760 --> 57:25.759
Wanted to see his kid again, too.
They weren't in touch.

57:25.760 --> 57:28.319
No, but he wrote to Bailey's mum,
didn't he?

57:28.320 --> 57:29.879
His sister sent it for him.

57:29.880 --> 57:33.559
Did he?
Look...

57:33.560 --> 57:35.599
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Conn.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.759
He was a good bloke, he was my mate.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.720
I want you to get whoever it was
just as much as you do.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.720
So, who do you think it was?

57:45.760 --> 57:48.040
He fell out with Steve
at The Civvy Centre before me.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.079
Mark, I need you to check
Tony Castillo's alibi.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.359
He says he was
at the Banner Avenue Hostel

57:58.360 --> 58:00.079
on Saturday night.
Ma'am.

58:00.080 --> 58:02.919
And double check
Steve Wilson's alibi,

58:02.920 --> 58:06.279
cos Tony's just told us
Conn had a pop at Steve last week,

58:06.280 --> 58:08.079
something he failed to mention.

58:08.080 --> 58:11.999
So, any news on Dominic Charlton
or Jack Swanson's widow?

58:12.000 --> 58:15.399
Nothing. I've left voicemails
on all the numbers they gave us.

58:15.400 --> 58:17.959
It really threw Dylan,
the fact that Sam had been stealing.

58:17.960 --> 58:20.800
Well, I was gonna do a catch-up,
but it's got a bit...

58:23.480 --> 58:25.239
Sorry. Can I help you, love?

58:25.240 --> 58:27.039
Erm...

58:27.040 --> 58:29.999
Er, Ma'am.
He's been waiting for you.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.999
This is PC Billington
from reception.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.200
Stand up in the presence
of a senior officer.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.999
Now tell the DCI
just what you told me.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.599
Erm...

58:40.600 --> 58:43.119
I saw the flyer
for the man who died.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.280
The homeless man.

58:45.520 --> 58:46.959
And?

58:46.960 --> 58:49.039
Erm...

58:49.040 --> 58:51.639
He came into reception
Saturday evening.

58:51.640 --> 58:54.560
He wanted to make a statement.
Well, what did he say?

58:56.080 --> 58:59.599
He said...
someone had stolen something.

58:59.600 --> 59:02.039
Stolen what?
I dunno.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.559
Did he mention any names? Tony?

59:04.560 --> 59:07.039
He wasn't making any sense.
He said it was a while ago.

59:07.040 --> 59:10.519
And he was agitated,
and there was a queue, so...

59:10.520 --> 59:12.480
So you what?

59:13.720 --> 59:15.559
I said he was wasting my time,
and then he left.

59:15.560 --> 59:17.719
You said what?

59:17.720 --> 59:20.319
Well, let me tell you
what happened to him.

59:20.320 --> 59:24.040
He was murdered a couple of hours
after that, love.

59:25.040 --> 59:28.079
And we've no idea if that's why
he came in here or not.

59:28.080 --> 59:31.359
I'm so sorry.
Now go back to your desk.

59:31.360 --> 59:32.680
Yes, Ma'am.

59:38.760 --> 59:41.840
Well, you lot better go home.
Fresh eyes tomorrow.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.839
Now, about Kate.

59:48.840 --> 59:51.400
Did you forward on a letter to her?

59:52.440 --> 59:53.720
From Conn?

59:55.440 --> 59:57.320
He didn't think he was allowed
to write to her.

59:58.840 --> 1:00:01.399
I sent it just before Christmas,
but she never replied.

1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:04.159
Well, you can hardly blame her,
love.

1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:05.959
He left her in loads of debt.

1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:09.960
And he was putting that right.
That's what the letter was about.

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:13.439
He was giving her the payout.

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:15.279
What payout?

1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:17.319
For his accident in the army.

1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:19.480
When his gun went off
and he got shot.

1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:23.200
He had the money sent to Kate.

1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:26.800
That's why he wrote to her.

1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:31.479
He was hoping that,
with that and the flat,

1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:33.879
she'd agree to him
seeing Bailey again.

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.880
Are you sure about this?

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:39.119
Of course.

1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:43.599
He got £25,000 from the army.

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.840
And she didn't reply to the letter?

1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:50.719
Morning, Aiden.
Sorry to wake you up.

1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:52.879
'Morning, Ma'am.'
Listen, I'm on my way in.

1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:58.039
I need you to get hold of
that warrant officer, Dylan, is it?

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.719
Apparently, Connail Burns
got a payout from the army

1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:04.599
for that gun accident,

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:08.199
and I need you to get him
to chase it up, hmm? Look into it.

1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:09.879
Yeah, well,
Lieutenant Colonel Hillier

1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:11.639
never mentioned that
when we saw her.

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:13.160
'Well, maybe she didn't know.'

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.800
Or maybe that's why
she was being obstructive.

1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:20.680
Anyway, get onto it.

1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:32.239
HE SIGHS

1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:34.680
Before you ask,
I'm still on it, Ma'am.

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:38.879
Oh, Kenny, what are those?

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.319
Er, these are bacon rolls, Ma'am.

1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:43.759
Oh, the answer to my prayers.
Er...

1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:45.719
Oh, thanks, love.

1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:49.239
Now, Mark, did you check out
Tony Castillo's alibi?

1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:53.800
Yeah. He entered the hostel at
10.15pm and didn't leave until 8am.

1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.559
And what about Steve Wilson?

1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:58.679
He was at the fundraiser all night.

1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:00.879
Er, he left the venue at 1am,
Ma'am.

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:03.079
Ma'am, I checked up
on Kate Burns' finances.

1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:04.879
She was made redundant
two months ago.

1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:08.919
Was she?
Well, that's not what she told me.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:11.119
The amount of debt she's got,
she's gonna be in trouble

1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:12.679
if she doesn't
find another job soon.

1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:14.799
Hmm...

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:19.679
As an ex-soldier's wife,
would she get anything when he dies?

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:22.479
Er, theoretically, she's entitled
to part of his pension,

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.039
unless she remarries.

1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:26.120
Right.

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:28.960
Aiden, get your coat.

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.520
Oh, thanks, love.

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:42.319
HE CHUCKLES

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:45.359
Spoke to Teresa last night.

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:47.079
Conn's sister?

1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:51.959
And she told us he received
a payout for that accident he had,

1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:55.519
the gun injury,
and the money was paid to you.

1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:58.239
Well, I haven't had a penny
since he left.

1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:00.319
Check my bank records.

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:04.999
And she also told us she forwarded
on a letter to you from him.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.439
When? I've never had a letter.
I swear on Bailey's life.

1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:11.439
We know that you've lied to us once.
When?

1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:14.479
You said that you worked
at Dayton Hospice.

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:17.479
That's not true, is it?
You've been made redundant.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:18.639
Well, I...

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:21.599
I haven't told Liv yet.
I'm hoping to get another job.

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:24.159
Why didn't you get a divorce?

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:25.760
What's that got to do with anything?

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:30.760
For his pension.

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:33.880
He said to stay married
so I could get it.

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.879
He wrote a will
before going to Afghanistan.

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.919
Oh, so you'll be getting that now,
of course?

1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:41.639
Along with his accident payout.

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:44.240
I didn't get anything. I told you!

1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:50.000
Conn broke my heart,
and you're talking about money?

1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:53.680
Do you think I'd kill him for that?

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:03.959
Mark, I need you to run
a check on Conn Burns' wife.

1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:06.839
Phone, ANPR on her car.

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:09.399
And check out the girlfriend, too.

1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:10.759
Ma'am.

1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:13.879
Now where are we
with this army payout?

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.079
I followed it up.

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:17.759
Conn went through
a no-win-no-fee type company.

1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:19.799
I got in contact with them,
and they confirmed it.

1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:22.359
The army paid out £25,000
last month.

1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:25.159
Well, put in an urgent request
for paperwork.

1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:27.039
Will do.
We need to find that money.

1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:31.039
Boss. I've got the address
for Jack Swanson's widow,

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:32.280
Lindsay Swanson.

1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:38.079
Sounds like they were
a very tight unit,

1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:42.479
so Jack Swanson dying of cancer
must have really affected Conn.

1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:43.719
And as for Afghanistan,

1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:48.200
well, Sam Gastrell's suicide
must have affected them all.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:59.079
DOORBELL RINGS

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:01.360
'Did you talk to Conn
at the funeral?'

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:05.879
I was too numb. Still am.

1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:07.759
He spent all his time with Dom.

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:11.519
Dom?
Dominic Charlton. Corporal.

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.959
They were having a good time,
and then...

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:16.999
they started arguing. Conn left.
Dom said he was drunk.

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.320
No, Conn was dry.

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:24.919
Now, we know that something
at the funeral badly affected Conn.

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:27.319
Came back a different man.

1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:30.119
Now, have you got any idea at all

1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:32.480
what that argument with Dom
was about?

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.399
I think it was the same thing

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:38.559
that went on with my husband
and Dom.

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:41.959
There was a section member
who killed himself in Afghanistan.

1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:45.079
Private Sam Gastrell,
stole some sunglasses.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:47.200
Jack didn't think Sam stole them.

1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:50.559
He never saw it. Neither did Conn.

1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:53.919
Well, if he didn't see him
steal them, why did he say he did?

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:56.479
Because Dom told them to.

1:05:56.480 --> 1:05:58.159
He said he'd seen it.

1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:01.320
But here's the thing,
on his social media...

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:06.639
..Dom was wearing
the exact same sunglasses

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.599
Sam allegedly stole.

1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:10.160
It brought it all back for Jack.

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:14.560
He... He never felt right
about pointing the finger at Sam.

1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:18.799
Sam was the youngest in the squad.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:21.039
Grew up in care like Conn.

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:22.160
He looked up to them all.

1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:28.719
Poor Sam was devastated
people thought he'd done it.

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:31.400
And that's why he killed himself?

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:35.280
After Jack saw that photo,
he said it made sense.

1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:39.640
Of course it was Dom who stole them,
not Sam.

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:43.680
Sam would never steal
off a dead soldier.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:55.319
So, this Dominic
steals the sunglasses,

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:58.279
blames it on Sam Gastrell
and convinces Jack and Conn

1:06:58.280 --> 1:06:59.399
that this is the truth.

1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:01.120
What a piece of work.

1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:05.559
Conn?
Mm.

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:06.680
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.879
Did you see him often?

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:13.319
Now and then.
I didn't always talk to him.

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:15.759
When I heard about Jack,
I knew he'd wanna be there.

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:16.919
Must be strange.

1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:19.199
I mean, him being on the streets
and you being up here.

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.239
Well, that's life, isn't it?
You didn't try and help him?

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:26.039
You can't help anyone who won't
help themselves. Number one rule.

1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:28.080
Oh, ain't that the truth?

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:33.400
Now, Lindsay says that you and Conn
were arguing at the funeral.

1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:35.600
What about?

1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:40.159
He was just upset about Jack.
Felt sorry for Lindsay.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:41.320
Ah.

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.519
And someone mentioned Sam Gastrell.

1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:49.479
Does that name ring any bells?

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:50.879
Yeah.

1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:53.959
Conn was upset about him.
We all were, of course.

1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:55.599
Killed himself.

1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:59.079
After being accused
of stealing some sunglasses?

1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:01.079
Hm. Terrible business.

1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:04.520
Well, course, it was you
who caught him in the act.

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:14.439
Between us, it was Jack Swanson
who caught him,

1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:17.119
but he was just a private,
so he asked me to report it.

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:19.320
Did Conn know that?

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.159
Yeah.

1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:25.560
Yeah, that's...
that's why he was upset.

1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:32.759
I let slip I thought it was Jack
who'd actually stolen them.

1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:34.520
So Sam was innocent?

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.199
Well, that wouldn't have
sat well with Conn.

1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:41.519
He was appalled.

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.599
He'd backed a lie.

1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:44.680
As had you.

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:49.040
Did you tell Lindsay this
at the funeral?

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:53.679
Jack's dead. It was years ago.

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:55.520
Why take away
from what he's achieved?

1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:02.080
They didn't have each other's backs,
they were stabbing them!

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:07.719
What did you do with them?
I booked them.

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.959
PC Billington.
Ma'am.

1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:14.240
Now, that theft Connail Burns
wanted to report...

1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:19.039
..did he mention a Dominic?

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.439
Yes. That was it. Dominic.

1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:23.999
I knew it.

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.200
Bring him in.

1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:28.760
Well done, pet.

1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:39.800
SIRENS OUTSIDE

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:42.519
Ma'am, Dominic's ready for you.

1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:45.079
Right. Now, Mark,
did you do some digging?

1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:47.639
Yeah, according to ANPR,

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:51.079
Dominic left Newcastle
soon after Conn's time of death.

1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:54.599
Right, and what did that
warrant officer say about him?

1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:56.679
At the time of the theft,
he was on thin ice.

1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:59.039
If he'd been caught,
he could've done time in Colchester.

1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:01.839
Well, he wouldn't want
that coming out, would he?

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:03.439
Cost him his fancy job.

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:05.999
But that's a strong motivation
to shut him up.

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.799
Now, Kenny,
anything on that army payout?

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.159
It was paid into a bank account
recently set up in Conn's name.

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:14.719
We're still waiting
on the third party address.

1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:18.359
But there was a withdrawal from
the account on the evening he died.

1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:21.240
Was there?
Yes, there was £200 taken.

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.239
Well, chase that up, Kenny.

1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:26.879
And see if there was
a camera in that machine.

1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:28.199
Yes, Ma'am.

1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:31.239
Right, let's go and make him sweat.

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:32.599
We've got your car on ANPR.

1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:35.639
So we know that you were
in Newcastle when Conn was murdered.

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:37.839
Why on Earth would I kill him?

1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:39.199
Well, to protect yourself.

1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:42.359
To stop it coming out
that you'd lied to the army.

1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:44.559
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:47.679
You signed an official document

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:50.919
stating that you saw
Private Sam Gastrell

1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:53.279
steal those sunglasses, correct?

1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:56.439
Yes, but I explained
it was really Jack who stole them.

1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:59.679
Yeah, well, newsflash, love.
That's still lying.

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:02.679
So, you're saying that
a private persuaded a corporal

1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:04.159
and a lance corporal to lie for him?

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:08.159
Now, I find that hard to believe.
You were their superior.

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.080
So if you told them it was Sam,
why would they question that?

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.719
But you slipped up recently,

1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:18.319
bragging about your swanky holiday
in Dubai.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:21.519
Posting your photos
all over your socials.

1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:24.599
Cos it didn't go unnoticed...

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:29.000
that you were wearing
those same sunglasses.

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.879
Cos it was you who stole them,
wasn't it? Not Sam.

1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:39.319
And I think that's what Conn
got wind of at that funeral.

1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:43.399
Show him your holiday snaps,
did you? No wonder he lost it.

1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:45.200
I didn't kill him.

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:47.319
If I'd wanted to do that,

1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:50.239
I would've given him
two bottles of whisky.

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:51.960
How can you sleep at night?

1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:56.000
Cos you think you're in the clear,
don't you?

1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.639
Hmm? Sam gone because of you.
Jack gone.

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.480
And now Connail Burns.

1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:08.600
Some people float, some sink.

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:15.200
I have an alibi for Saturday night.

1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:18.399
I was doing close protection.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:20.920
Who for?
Our local MP.

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:23.519
Ask her.

1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:25.600
OK, thank you.

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:27.879
Alibi's rock solid, Ma'am.

1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.839
They were together from 6.30pm
till 2am Sunday morning.

1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:33.879
We're getting nowhere fast here.

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.599
Ma'am, I double checked.

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:37.919
Steve was at the fundraiser,
but it wasn't far.

1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:40.479
He could've gone out, killed Conn
and been back in minutes.

1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:43.879
Ma'am,
Mandy's sent the CCTV through.

1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:45.040
At last!

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.040
There...

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:52.640
Jac, can you zoom in on that bit.
Yeah.

1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:57.280
Look, there's Gary. Benny's dog.

1:12:58.840 --> 1:12:59.960
Benny was there.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.440
There you are. What a good boy.
What a good boy.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:08.959
Hello, love.

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:12.680
I'm not in trouble, am I?
No, pet, no, you're not.

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:15.999
Now, I just want
to show you something.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.040
Now, this is a still from the CCTV
at The Civvy Centre.

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:22.639
Now, here's Conn.
Right.

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:25.799
And look here.
There's a reflection of Gary.

1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:28.799
So you must've been there,
at the same time.

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.559
Now, who was Conn shouting at?

1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:33.600
Well, me. He was shouting at me.

1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:37.719
He wanted someone to hear,
but I thought he was just rambling.

1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:39.679
What was he saying?

1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:42.599
Well...
He said they were stealing from him,

1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:45.800
but, I mean,
what did he have to steal?

1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:51.399
Ma'am, the address has come
through for Conn's new bank account.

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:54.480
It's The Civvy Centre.
Kenny...

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:59.839
..is The Civvy Centre account
at the same bank as Conn's?

1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:02.720
Aye, it is. It turns out cash
has been going out of it for weeks.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:06.400
Well, it's unlikely to be Conn,
he's been on the streets.

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:11.919
So who was it drawing money from it
on the night he died?

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.400
Ma'am, that's who.

1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:33.679
We're in the middle of a meeting.
We're not here for you, pet.

1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:36.119
Amanda Wilson,
I'm arresting you on suspicion

1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:37.599
of defrauding Connail Burns.

1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:40.399
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:42.079
It's no use denying it, pet.

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:46.639
You took £200 from his account
on the day he died.

1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:49.839
You helped him fill out the
compensation forms for his accident.

1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.759
You set up his new bank account
with him.

1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:53.559
You wanted to control his money,

1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:56.159
and you've been helping yourself
ever since.

1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:59.799
And that fundraiser
wasn't far from where he died,

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:01.840
and you left early.

1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:05.799
You think I killed him? Please!

1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:08.959
Now, we know he was weak.
It wouldn't have taken much.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:11.759
He'd found out that money
hadn't gone to his wife.

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:13.839
He realised it had been stolen,

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:16.119
and we've got a witness
who can testify

1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:17.920
that's why he was upset
on the Saturday.

1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:21.439
"They stole from me."
That's what he's saying.

1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:23.400
So, what were you spending it on?

1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:25.480
Whatever I wanted.

1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:29.439
Do you know where
my nana's money went?

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.399
To Steve. To The Civvy Centre.

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:32.999
Every penny.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.840
Why would I kill him?
He's worth more to me alive.

1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:40.639
She's a thief,
but she's not a killer.

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:44.319
Someone closer to Conn
is responsible for his death.

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:46.960
Now, I need you all to bear with me
on this.

1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:52.720
Connail Burns found out his wife
hadn't got that money.

1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:57.279
How? How'd he find out?

1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:01.279
Now, apart from when
he lost his job cos he was drunk,

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:04.760
he's always tried to do the right
thing. Tell the truth, right?

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:08.319
We've already seen him
chasing a mugger.

1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:11.319
It's been cause and effect.

1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:14.920
He found out Tony had stolen.
He didn't want to live with him.

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:19.159
He found out this fella
had given his girlfriend a shiner,

1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:20.959
and he confronted him.

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:26.039
And at that funeral,
he found out Dominic had lied

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.159
about Sam stealing those sunglasses,

1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:31.079
and he came here
to try and report him.

1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:33.159
So, let's look at the family.

1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:35.039
Now, we've discounted
Kate and Bailey,

1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:36.479
and Liv says she was working.

1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:38.759
Ma'am? I double checked Liv's alibi.

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:42.079
Now, the place she gave for hers
was closed. The club was flooded.

1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:44.039
Also, I don't know if it's relevant,

1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:46.679
but one of the clubs she
looked after was the Chez Lounge.

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:50.159
Ah, now,
this is too much of a coincidence.

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:53.439
Mark, I need you
to get over to that club,

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:56.359
talk to the bouncer
who gave us Conn's name.

1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:58.480
But keep it low-key, mm?

1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:03.760
Now, I want everything there
is to know about Liv Masters.

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:06.000
Yes!

1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:12.400
Liv's ANPR's in.

1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:17.279
She was in Newcastle.

1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:20.079
Parked round the corner
from Chez Lounge at half eleven.

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:22.839
There. About 300m away
from the crime scene.

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:25.559
Now, could she have got from there
without being seen?

1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:27.239
Yeah, if she knows
where the cameras are.

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.439
Well, course she does,
she's in security.

1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:31.359
Liv's clean.
She's not in the system.

1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:33.119
Not even a parking ticket.

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:35.959
Ma'am, I spoke to Finlay,
the helpful bouncer.

1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:37.039
He didn't see her.

1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:39.679
She'd told him she'd gone
to the club in Sunderland.

1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:41.039
He didn't know about the flood.

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:43.799
He said she was at Chez Lounge
the night before.

1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:46.679
She was there on Friday night?

1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:49.159
Well, that's when Conn
would've spoken to her,

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:51.199
found out his missus
hadn't got that payout.

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:52.279
Anything on camera?

1:17:52.280 --> 1:17:54.599
No, CCTV at the club's
worse than useless.

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.039
Finlay said it's faulty.

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.599
Run this Finlay through the system,
Mark.

1:17:58.600 --> 1:17:59.839
Shall I bring her in, Ma'am?

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:02.799
Er... No, no.
I reckon she can be tricky.

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.639
We need to be clever.

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.599
Ma'am.
Finlay's got previous for dealing.

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:10.999
I knew it!
Right, this is gonna be a late one.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.120
Come on, we're going clubbing.

1:18:14.320 --> 1:18:15.640
DISTANT SIRENS

1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:25.520
Hello again, Finlay.

1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:28.359
What is it? We open in an hour.

1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:32.479
Ah, well, it's about the night
that fella died. Conn.

1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:34.919
Just got a few questions.

1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:36.719
Oh, aye?

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:39.719
Sure.
Ah, well, before I ask you,

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.880
would you mind emptying
your pockets?

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:54.960
You missed one, pet, on the inside.

1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:02.479
Your boss all right
with you dealing?

1:19:02.480 --> 1:19:05.559
Now, I'm not interested
in that, love.

1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:10.279
What I am interested in
is your boss, Liv Masters.

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:14.799
Look, I already told your officer,
she wasn't in that night.

1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:16.119
She was in Sunderland.

1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:19.599
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant the night before,

1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:21.239
when she was here.

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.279
Aye? And?

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:24.800
Did she leave the club that night?

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:29.239
Look, I wouldn't be asking
these questions,

1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:33.400
except your CCTV doesn't work
because of that...

1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:37.879
Look, Liv met some girl.
Got off with her outside. That's it.

1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:40.199
Did you have eyes on her
the whole time?

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:42.520
No. I mean, that's Liv's business.

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:47.680
What, so, are we done?
Ah. You must be joking, pet. Bag it.

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:18.800
All good?
MAN: Great, thanks.

1:20:23.800 --> 1:20:25.800
WOMAN: There you go, Liv.
Thanks, babe.

1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:31.120
Good to see you
taking the initiative, Finlay.

I'm feeling very refreshed
this morning.

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:25.679
So I'm going to give you a chance,
Olivia,

1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:27.560
to tell us your side of the story.

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:30.479
I haven't done anything.

1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.599
Oh, well, let's put it another way.

1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:36.359
Do you admit to the murder
of Connail Burns?

1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:38.039
No, absolutely not.

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.199
Only you told my officer

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:44.119
that you were working in a club
in Sunderland on Saturday night,

1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:46.239
only that club was shut,
it was flooded.

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:49.359
Yeah. And I was there with a mop.
That's not what the manager said.

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:52.080
No. He told us you asked him to lie.

1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:57.919
And did you intercept a letter
to Kate sent by Conn's sister?

1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:00.319
The nun? Don't think so.

1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:02.719
She sent it just before Christmas.

1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:05.999
Kate told us that she and Bailey
went away just before Christmas,

1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:07.640
and you stayed behind to work.

1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:14.279
Look, I did that for Kate, OK?

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:18.799
Conn's sister had been in touch
before, wanted Kate to forgive Conn.

1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:19.999
It upset her for weeks.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.039
Why was she upset?

1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:24.239
Because she felt guilty.
Or maybe she still loved him.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:26.800
LIV SCOFFS
He was useless.

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:29.640
He was weak.

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:33.879
Left her in debt and then ran off
when things got tough.

1:22:33.880 --> 1:22:35.439
Did you give her the letter?

1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:38.039
Course I didn't give her the letter.
It was a fairy tale.

1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:40.399
Said he was gonna give Kate
thousands of pounds

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:42.279
and be her knight in shining armour.

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:43.439
He was messing her around.

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:47.119
Look, you were seen talking to Conn
the night before he was murdered,

1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:50.599
and did you tell him to his face
on Friday night

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:52.439
that you thought
it was all a fairy tale?

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:56.439
Cos it wasn't.
He got that payout.

1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:57.999
£25,000.

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.519
And that conversation with you

1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:03.439
was the first he'd heard
that she didn't receive it.

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:06.319
So, what? You think I took it?
Oh, no, no, love, I don't.

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:09.599
No, he knew that was someone else
taking advantage.

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:13.919
But when precisely
did you tell him, hmm?

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:18.560
Was it before or after
he caught you kissing someone else?

1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:22.999
Your bouncer with initiative
has told us everything.

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.319
Sang like a canary.

1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:27.279
How long's this been going on?

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:30.000
It was one night.

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:33.399
Look, I love Kate and Bailey.

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:35.359
They're everything to me.
They're my family.

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:37.479
And they were his too, love!

DCI Stanhope is receiving

1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:49.000
Thanks, Jac.

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:52.880
Oh, the wonders of science!

1:23:54.840 --> 1:24:00.439
You can hide from cameras, love,
but you can't hide from DNA,

1:24:00.440 --> 1:24:03.959
and your DNA was all over the scarf

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:06.560
that suffocated Connail Burns.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.199
You must have thought all
your Christmases had come at once

1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:13.880
when you found him lying there.

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:16.680
I thought he was dead...

1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:21.199
..and I felt relieved
that it was finally over,

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:23.320
and he wasn't gonna be around
any more.

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:26.600
No-one really cared about him...

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:30.480
..and Kate and Bailey would be
so much better off without him.

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:33.840
They needed a fresh start.

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.560
And then he opened his eyes...

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:44.440
..and I needed
to feel relieved again.

1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:47.120
So you killed him?

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:50.879
QUIETLY: Took less than a minute.

1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:53.519
Can you speak up, love,
for the benefit of the tape.

1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:55.480
I said it took less than a minute.

1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:58.999
You know, I was quite surprised,
actually.

1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:00.799
I thought he'd put up a bit more
of a fight,

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.280
you know, being a soldier and all...

1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:05.919
I guess he was just glad
it was over.

1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:07.679
Oh!

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:10.320
You think he was grateful to you
for killing him?

1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:15.959
That man had nothing left
to live for.

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:19.919
He had everything to live for,

1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:22.240
and you were just jealous.

1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:27.440
A chaotic and drunk Conn?
Oh, he was no threat to you, was he?

1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:30.839
But a Conn who'd turned
his life around?

1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:33.919
Oh, now, that's a different matter.

1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.959
No wonder you tore up that letter.

1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:39.640
You wouldn't have stood a chance.

You do great work here.

had nothing to do with you.
