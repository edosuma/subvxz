20:23.787 --> 20:25.485
Then he'll release the hostages?

20:25.528 --> 20:26.964
That's what he says,
but it doesn't matter.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.096
It's never gonna happen.Hey.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.706
He's got innocent
people in there.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.795
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.321
Can you defuse the situation
on the ground?

20:35.364 --> 20:36.974
Not without casualties.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.803
Well, you're gonna
have to find a way.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.721
[phone rings]

20:44.765 --> 20:46.506
Gordie, what's up?

20:48.377 --> 20:49.552
All right.

20:51.554 --> 20:52.686
Yeah.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.212
What are you doing?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.822
I'm improvising
a defensive weapon.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.738
I believe you Yanks
call it a shiv.

21:01.782 --> 21:04.045
It's a shank.

21:04.088 --> 21:07.701
Okay, so the one in charge
must be Freddie Vaughn.

21:07.744 --> 21:08.919
HPD's compiling dossiers

21:08.963 --> 21:10.269
on Ray, Freddie
and any known associates.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.183
Hopefully we'll be able
to ID his crew.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.837
They still won't
answer the phone.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.926
Well, that makes sense
Freddie's ghosting HPD.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.276
I mean, he knows
CIA is in charge,

21:17.319 --> 21:19.278
so why would he deal
with you guys?

21:19.321 --> 21:21.018
Taking the building
is a last resort.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.281
I won't risk innocent lives.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.325
So I'm stuck[elevator dings]

21:23.369 --> 21:25.109
until I can make contact.Yo, yo.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.111
We're about to make contact
with one of them right now.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.417
Got to go.

21:50.918 --> 21:51.919
On your feet.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.356
Now.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.792
Please.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.838
Please don't shoot me.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.754
No need to wave that gun
in my face.

22:00.797 --> 22:03.278
Who else is with you?No one. I'm here alone.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.236
You pulled yourself
through an elevator hatch?

22:05.280 --> 22:07.326
I-I took gymnastics as a child.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.371
I-I've seen it in films.
I thought I'd give it a shot.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.851
You're lying.

22:15.943 --> 22:18.249
[laughs]

22:18.293 --> 22:20.208
Guess your daddy never told you
not to bring a knife

22:20.251 --> 22:21.470
to a gunfight.Well...

22:21.514 --> 22:24.038
Unless you got
serious backup.

22:24.081 --> 22:26.127
[grunting]

22:37.530 --> 22:39.706
Would you care to
introduce yourself?

22:39.749 --> 22:41.098
[scoffs]

22:41.142 --> 22:42.665
My friends
are gonna look for me.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.407
And when they find you,
they're gonna shoot you

22:45.451 --> 22:47.235
each in the head.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.542
How exactly did you think
this was gonna end?

22:49.585 --> 22:51.848
Ray Vaughn will never
be set free.

22:51.892 --> 22:54.198
HIGGINS:
Hmm.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.897
Seems like our friend here
has no idea what this is about.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.735
He's a Ranger.

23:10.693 --> 23:11.564
Let me see that tat.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.524
[shutter clicks]

23:15.568 --> 23:17.091
Say cheese.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.312
AirDropping it to you right now.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.581
Got it.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.930
Gents, say hello
to Private Kurt Brill,

23:29.973 --> 23:32.280
formerly of the 3rd Battalion.

23:32.323 --> 23:33.847
Did some time
in disciplinary barracks

23:33.890 --> 23:35.152
for assault,
battery and theft,

23:35.196 --> 23:37.503
after which he was
dishonorably discharged.

23:37.546 --> 23:38.939
Figures.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.114
That's why he doesn't
know anything.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.637
He's a mercenary.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.596
Sending this info to Gordon.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.771
[radio crackles]

23:44.814 --> 23:46.555
WOMAN: KB, come in.Told you.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.649
KB, do you read me?You're finished.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.086
Tired of you talking.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.092
MAN:
Whoever you are,

24:02.136 --> 24:05.531
I'm giving you one chance
to turn yourself in.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.760
WOMAN:
Please!

24:17.804 --> 24:20.023
please do what he says.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.244
MAN:
That was Jeanie Kapule.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.898
She's 25.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.248
You got 60 seconds
to turn yourself in

24:27.291 --> 24:29.206
or she won't see 26.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.080
Don't hurt her.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.690
I'm coming down.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.086
TC, what did you just do?

24:39.129 --> 24:41.131
They don't seem to know how
many of us were in the elevator.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.785
This way they'll
think it was just me.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.527
That'll buy you guys some time.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.448
Like I said, there ain't nothing

24:53.492 --> 24:55.494
that I wouldn't do
to protect my family.

24:56.625 --> 24:57.931
TC...
Look,

24:57.974 --> 24:59.149
we've been through worse.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.673
I got this.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.006
[elevator dings]

25:37.274 --> 25:38.580
See you, Brill.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.586
TC took the elevator from seven.

25:44.630 --> 25:45.761
Because we're on ten.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.458
Means Freddie
and his goons

25:47.502 --> 25:49.243
are gonna look for us on seven.

25:49.286 --> 25:50.374
Right.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.595
[elevator dings]

25:53.639 --> 25:54.944
[phone ringing]

25:54.988 --> 25:57.294
Hold it right there.

25:57.338 --> 25:59.340
Don't move.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.124
Take it easy, man.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.386
Where's my guy?

26:02.430 --> 26:03.518
Who, Baldy?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.302
Knocked his ass out.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.087
Left him somewhere on seven.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.654
Why didn't you take his gun?

26:08.697 --> 26:11.178
I figure if you see me
with a gun, you'll just kill me.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.919
You alone?

26:12.962 --> 26:14.137
If I wasn't,

26:14.181 --> 26:16.531
I would have come
down here blasting.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.967
Head to seven, find KB.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.534
[phone ringing]

26:20.883 --> 26:22.581
Get in line
with the rest of 'em.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.888
[elevator dings]

26:25.932 --> 26:27.455
[mouths]

26:42.688 --> 26:44.864
MAGNUM: Gordon.Rendition plane

26:44.907 --> 26:46.866
is wheels down in 20 minutes.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.041
Freddie must know that,
which means

26:48.084 --> 26:49.564
we're fighting a ticking clock.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.174
We have to free the hostages

26:51.218 --> 26:53.350
before that plane lifts off.
If Freddie doesn't

26:53.394 --> 26:55.048
hear from his brother, there's
no telling what he'll do.

26:55.091 --> 26:57.703
I've been calling the lobby,
but they still won't answer.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.879
Don't worry about it.
TC knows the deal.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.228
He'll make sure
he picks up.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.404
Wait, they got TC?Well, not exactly.

27:03.447 --> 27:06.059
Uh, he sacrificed himself
to save a hostage

27:06.102 --> 27:07.713
and give us time to get rid
of more of Freddie's men.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.323
I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.630
No.
That's who he is.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.893
That's who all of you are.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.986
Magnum.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.118
Blackbeard's now on seven.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.903
We have to go.Be careful.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.732
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I got to talk to Katsumoto.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.995
You need to stay back.What are you gonna do,
arrest me?

27:29.038 --> 27:29.996
Gordon! Come on.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.085
Hey, it's okay. Let him through.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.870
Hey.

27:34.914 --> 27:37.656
What's going on?
They in there?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.919
HIGGINS:
If SWAT

27:39.962 --> 27:41.921
hears gunfire, they'll
likely storm the building,

27:41.964 --> 27:43.574
putting the hostages
at greater risk.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.185
Which means we need
to take out Blackbeard

27:45.228 --> 27:46.621
without firing
a single shot.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.927
Exactly.
What's the plan?

27:47.970 --> 27:50.016
I have an idea.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.626
[phone ringing]

27:51.670 --> 27:53.193
[indistinct whispering]

27:59.895 --> 28:02.942
You should really answer that.You should really

28:02.985 --> 28:03.986
shut the hell up.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.120
It's HPD.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.078
Shut up!

28:10.514 --> 28:11.994
You don't know anything.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.517
Actually, I know a whole lot.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.432
I know the cops are in contact

28:15.476 --> 28:17.826
with the CIA... Freddie.

28:19.785 --> 28:20.742
If the cops know who...

28:20.786 --> 28:23.005
You law enforcement?

28:23.049 --> 28:24.485
Hell, no.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.530
FREDDIE:
There is no way HPD gives you

28:26.574 --> 28:28.097
that information.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.403
Who told me, then?

28:29.446 --> 28:31.100
It wasn't your boy Brill.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.841
He's just hired muscle.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.191
Look, you want
what you want,

28:35.235 --> 28:37.237
but you don't know
if you're gonna get it.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.414
The CIA's been talking to HPD.

28:40.457 --> 28:42.416
So the cops know what's up.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.332
That's them
on the other end of that line.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.508
So, if I were you,

28:47.551 --> 28:49.553
I'd pick up the damn phone.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.994
[line ringing]

28:58.345 --> 28:59.999
I don't get it. If they're
not gonna pick up,

29:00.042 --> 29:01.522
why don't they just
take it off the hook?

29:01.565 --> 29:03.176
They need that phone to get
the call from Ray Vaughn.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.438
FONG:
We got to stop
dicking around here.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.266
It's time to take the building.

29:06.309 --> 29:07.876
You didn't give me a plan
without innocent casualties.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.182
Freddie won't
answer.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.531
Feds won't negotiate.

29:10.574 --> 29:11.750
Look, it's not ideal,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.316
but the clock's running out.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.796
It's our only option.RICK:
No, no, you don't know that.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.842
My friends are in there.
They're gonna fix this.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.321
If that were true,
it'd be done by now.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.193
Your friends
are outmatched.You don't know them.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.151
Hey! Hey!All right?

29:22.195 --> 29:24.893
FREDDIE:
Who am I talking to?

29:26.808 --> 29:29.202
This is
Detective Gordon Katsumoto.

29:29.245 --> 29:31.030
And?

29:31.073 --> 29:34.076
I'm on your side, Freddie.
I want

29:34.120 --> 29:35.599
to help you.I doubt that.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.036
Look, I know what you want,

29:37.079 --> 29:39.560
and the CIA won't negotiate.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.562
But those people in there,

29:41.605 --> 29:43.346
they're innocent.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.174
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.785
Not even you.
So how do we solve this?

29:51.224 --> 29:52.616
FREDDIE:
You listen to me.

29:55.315 --> 29:59.058
My brother, Ray--
he loved this country.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.755
And that's why
he did what he did.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.539
And now the Feds
want to put him in a cage

30:02.583 --> 30:03.714
to rot?

30:03.758 --> 30:05.107
I'm not letting that happen.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.500
I get it.

30:06.543 --> 30:09.633
And as long as the hostages
are alive and unharmed,

30:09.677 --> 30:10.896
you still have leverage.

30:10.939 --> 30:13.420
But once someone gets hurt,
all bets are off.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.378
Look, you got to know,

30:15.422 --> 30:16.423
when it all came out,

30:16.466 --> 30:17.772
I was on your brother's side.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.947
I think he is a patriot.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.427
[Freddie laughing]

30:20.470 --> 30:23.256
I don't care
what you think, Detective.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.953
You want to help me out?

30:24.997 --> 30:27.086
You convince them
to let Ray go.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.262
And do it
in the next 14 minutes,

30:29.305 --> 30:30.916
'cause that's
when he lands in Oahu.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.265
If you fail,

30:32.308 --> 30:34.223
the hostages are gonna die.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.616
[hangs up]

30:35.659 --> 30:37.313
Can't wait anymore.
We got to go in

30:37.357 --> 30:39.359
before he starts
executing people.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.058
HIGGINS:
You do realize it's very likely
that Blackbeard

30:43.102 --> 30:45.060
is also a trained mercenary
just like Brill.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.801
Yeah, so?So I'm not so sure

30:46.845 --> 30:48.324
that your plan to deal
with him is going to work.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.630
It'll work.[scoffs]

30:49.673 --> 30:50.631
What, just like
your brilliant plan

30:50.674 --> 30:51.893
to ensure that I keep my visa?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.416
Sorry if I don't
share your confidence.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.157
You know, we wouldn't be
in this situation if you just

30:55.201 --> 30:57.159
accepted my offer to marry
you in the first place.Oh, right.

30:57.203 --> 31:00.249
So this entire situation
is my fault, is it?

31:00.293 --> 31:02.643
Your inability to accept
responsibility is astounding.

31:02.686 --> 31:04.427
