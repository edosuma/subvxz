WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:12.611
(wind howling)

00:25.726 --> 00:30.462
(whooshing)
(train rails clanking)

00:30.464 --> 00:33.632
(train horn blowing)

00:39.507 --> 00:42.541
(people chattering)

00:50.484 --> 00:52.751
(clicking)

01:05.331 --> 01:08.467
(train horn blowing)

01:09.270 --> 01:11.703
(somber music)

01:22.116 --> 01:23.649
- Who's my brave boy?

01:28.656 --> 01:29.621
Here, hold my hands.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.460
You're gonna wait here.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.428
Mama's gonna be
right back, okay?

01:38.566 --> 01:40.699
I told Grandpapa
to meet us here.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.244
- [Ivan] Be back soon.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.648
(dramatic violin music)

02:01.655 --> 02:04.823
(train horn blowing)

02:07.194 --> 02:09.495
(creaking)

02:12.566 --> 02:15.701
(steam hissing)

02:15.703 --> 02:18.770
(people chattering)

02:31.852 --> 02:32.751
- Evgeny.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.189
- [Evgeny] My little mouse.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.792
- I didn't think
you'd come home.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.795
I thought you'd
die on the front.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.234
- Should I leave my little
mouse all alone in the world?

02:52.873 --> 02:53.705
- I get by.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.709
(ominous music)

03:00.781 --> 03:02.347
- Where did they send you?

03:04.785 --> 03:05.684
Novgorod?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.187
To work in a factory?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.661
Did you manage to keep
your legs shut, bliad?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.730
- You know nothing
about how my life is.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.633
- Must I beat the
wantonness out of you?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.705
- I'm not afraid of you.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.342
Get back on that train.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.311
Go!

03:33.480 --> 03:34.813
- Still my little hothead.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.685
If you snatch a kettle from
the stove you get burned.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.222
Can the mouse not even squeak?

03:43.224 --> 03:44.323
No, come on, go ahead, do it!

03:44.325 --> 03:45.624
Do it!

03:45.626 --> 03:46.725
Stab me!

03:46.727 --> 03:48.727
Come on, stab me!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.797
I faced German bayonets.

03:51.799 --> 03:55.901
Shall I now quake in
front of my own wife?!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.469
(woman yelping)

03:57.471 --> 03:59.404
(huffing)

03:59.406 --> 04:01.640
- Why does it have
to be like this?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.976
- Because you want it like this.

04:03.978 --> 04:04.843
You love it.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.480
You do, I know the
games you like to play.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.849
I know them.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.520
And so I shall take
my belt to you, yeah?

04:15.522 --> 04:18.991
And I leave you
panting like a dog.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.795
Then you'll be the
good wife again

04:23.797 --> 04:25.931
and the fire will
go out of your eyes.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.900
Nothing changes,
my little mouse.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.337
- Nothing changes?

04:32.339 --> 04:34.873
(knife slicing)

04:37.278 --> 04:40.479
(distant shouting)

04:40.481 --> 04:41.847
(gasping)

04:41.849 --> 04:44.683
(groaning)

04:44.685 --> 04:48.353
(whistle blowing)

04:48.355 --> 04:49.755
You have a son, Ivan.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.761
And you will never
get to see him.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.631
(grunting)

04:59.633 --> 05:03.802
(man yelling in
foreign language)

05:06.774 --> 05:09.508
(ominous music)

05:13.881 --> 05:17.482
(dramatic violin music)

06:33.927 --> 06:37.129
(dramatic violin music)

07:02.022 --> 07:04.122
(clanking)

07:04.124 --> 07:07.192
(soldiers shouting)

07:13.033 --> 07:16.701
(construction commotion)

07:25.979 --> 07:29.581
(door clanking)

07:29.583 --> 07:31.817
(huffing)

07:50.237 --> 07:52.971
(ominous music)

07:55.709 --> 07:56.641
(woman coughing)

07:56.643 --> 08:00.545
(man shouting foreign language)

08:14.761 --> 08:17.963
(dramatic violin music)

08:21.635 --> 08:24.002
(dog barking)

08:34.982 --> 08:39.217
(women speaking
foreign language)

08:55.035 --> 08:58.036
(soldier spitting)

09:00.073 --> 09:01.606
(man shouting foreign language)

09:01.608 --> 09:03.842
(gasping)

09:10.050 --> 09:12.951
(water trickling)

09:16.890 --> 09:19.791
- Well, look at this.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.096
How many rubles
did that hair cost?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.206
Soft hands too.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.777
Lubov, feel this
chaynik's hands.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.246
Like velvet, no?

09:42.783 --> 09:43.682
- I'm Anastasia.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.151
- Tell us in a week, chaynik.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.120
- Where do I?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.221
- No one cares.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.898
Not that one, that's Prushka's.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.036
Polina's.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.872
- Just tell me
which one is mine.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.108
- [Masha] None of them.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.010
- But where do I sleep?

10:12.012 --> 10:13.912
- Anywhere that isn't a bed.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.218
(woman speaking indistinctly)

10:24.324 --> 10:25.790
- Let me see your hands.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.001
You can share my bunk.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.303
- Because I have soft hands?

10:39.873 --> 10:40.739
- Go on.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.241
Tell her, Svetlana.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.343
- She doesn't need to know.

10:47.414 --> 10:52.651
- Svetlana knows you
will only be here a week.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.289
It's why we don't bother
learning your name.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.664
Women with soft
hands never last.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.966
On the first day of work

11:07.968 --> 11:11.770
you will ache like never
before in your life,

11:11.772 --> 11:14.139
digging in frozen ground,

11:14.141 --> 11:17.375
dragging heavy logs
with your soft hands.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.278
Second day, you will stumble

11:20.280 --> 11:21.713
and on the third day

11:21.715 --> 11:22.347
(whip cracking)
(Anastasia groaning)

11:22.349 --> 11:23.248
you will fall.

11:24.751 --> 11:28.186
And they will pick
you back up again.

11:28.188 --> 11:32.223
And on the fourth day, they
will grind your soft hands

11:32.225 --> 11:34.292
under their steel boots.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.296
You think you'll live to see
the sun on the fifth day?

11:40.033 --> 11:40.932
Sixth?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.136
Svetlana will share
her bunk with you

11:45.138 --> 11:47.305
because she is
furthest from the stove

11:49.876 --> 11:52.077
and because she knows
it is only for a week

11:53.213 --> 11:55.413
and then there will be
nothing left of you.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.349
- I'm not as weak as you think.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.854
- You have one week to live.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.224
- But here, one week
can be like a lifetime

12:06.226 --> 12:08.793
and one night can drag
on for longer than that,

12:08.795 --> 12:10.495
so it all works out.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.498
(Lubov whimpering)

12:15.035 --> 12:16.301
- What's wrong with her?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.307
- She's bleeding.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.242
- Can I look.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.877
- She doesn't want your help.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.078
- But--
- She doesn't--

12:27.080 --> 12:28.012
- I might be able to--
- Want your help.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.981
- [Prushka] You're pretty.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.486
- The mouse speaks.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.256
It must be a holy day.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.224
What did you squeak?

12:41.128 --> 12:42.193
- She's pretty.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.432
- Lubov, you should
take a look at her.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.533
I know Yuri will.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.269
- Let me through.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.238
- She won't thank you.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.806
The rules are different here.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.475
- You can explain
them to me later.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.921
She has a fever.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.827
(yelping)

13:15.829 --> 13:19.297
Might be her appendix.
(groaning)

13:19.299 --> 13:20.832
Do we have clean water?

13:22.002 --> 13:25.136
- Only champagne
and French brandy.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.805
- There's a well.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.007
- [Anastasia] It must be clean.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.576
- It's clean enough to
have frogs in the summer.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.978
- [Svetlana]
There's always snow.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.014
- Bring some for her stomach.

13:36.016 --> 13:36.915
- Okay.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.151
- M'ne pù figu

13:40.987 --> 13:42.520
Fetch some snow.

13:42.522 --> 13:46.324
Or drag her out into it,
cut out the bureaucracy.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.827
(whimpering)

13:50.897 --> 13:53.331
(wind howling)

14:05.478 --> 14:10.548
(faint soldier shouting)
(woman yelping)

14:15.989 --> 14:18.389
(sniffling)

14:25.465 --> 14:28.333
(cloth tearing)

14:28.335 --> 14:31.202
(ominous music)

14:31.204 --> 14:34.005
(woman coughing)

14:46.419 --> 14:47.318
- [Woman] Mouse.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.155
(quivering)

14:56.329 --> 14:58.263
How long have I been down here?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.068
I don't know anymore.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.312
It's so cold.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.514
It's so cold.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.422
(gasping)

15:31.498 --> 15:34.299
(woman mumbling)

15:36.636 --> 15:38.670
I can't see you in the dark.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.674
(dogs barking)

15:44.344 --> 15:45.443
Come back!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.480
(water trickling)

15:53.987 --> 15:56.688
- I take it you
are the boss here.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.023
- For now.

15:59.025 --> 15:59.724
Looks like it.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.627
- What did you do?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.262
- [Masha] I worked for a living.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.397
- No, I mean, to end up in here.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.232
- What the hell would you know?

16:09.135 --> 16:10.702
- I--
- Nobody cares.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.103
Whatever you have done,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.505
there is someone in
here who has done worse.

16:14.507 --> 16:18.142
Stolen bigger, killed
more, killed their only...

16:20.447 --> 16:22.680
What you've done is nothing.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.284
All that matters
is what you do now.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.488
- You stole an
apple, didn't you?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.158
(chuckling)

16:35.528 --> 16:38.463
(water sloshing)

16:38.465 --> 16:41.432
(wind howling)

16:41.434 --> 16:42.533
- Here.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.173
(gasping)

16:49.175 --> 16:50.508
Will she be all right?

16:51.544 --> 16:54.645
- Something is
bruised or ruptured.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.348
She's a friend?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.283
- She brings us extra rations.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.420
- No friends in the GULAG.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.688
- No.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.722
No friends.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.525
You are in isolation.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.497
Even when you stand at
roll call with all of us,

17:13.532 --> 17:14.432
you are alone.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.602
We are all alone here.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.672
- The snow will help
with the swelling.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.575
Have to wait and see
what the damage is.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.382
- So we have a nursemaid
in the bunkhouse.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.085
I am Masha.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.554
This is Lubov.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.323
- And you?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.060
- Prushka.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.662
- You can call her
Mouse, everybody does.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.133
She hates it but she does
nothing to stop them.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.270
- Mouse.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.639
- Polina works in
the kitchens today.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.573
Another hour more.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.709
When you meet her,
don't look at her scar.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.078
She doesn't like it.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.547
- Thank you.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.082
- Don't thank me.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.552
I've just had enough
fighting for one night.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.623
(somber music)

18:12.625 --> 18:13.658
- What happened to her?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.360
- I never touched her.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.664
She got kicked.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.699
You see, that is
why I never fight.

18:21.701 --> 18:25.670
One day you are well,
the next day like so.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.305
From a kick.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.573
Not worth it.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.242
- But your husband
you fight with.

18:31.244 --> 18:35.680
- A long time ago, when
I was a hothead like you.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.782
- You were never like me.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.517
- Always.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.686
But one time, things go too far.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.321
And what happens?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.756
I was sentenced to eight years.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.492
- Eight years only.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.459
I got ten.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.661
- It was an accident.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.599
My husband was
another like Masha.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.466
Hothead.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.603
One night, he came
home late from work,

18:58.605 --> 19:01.239
stopped off for
vodka on the way,

19:01.241 --> 19:02.707
and his food was cold.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.544
In a fight between a
husband and a wife,

19:06.546 --> 19:07.712
something always breaks.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.882
He threw the dinner I had made.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.717
I took the kettle off the stove.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.620
Burned my hand.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.890
Here, I still have the scar.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.660
But I threw it.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.397
I threw it as hard as I could.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.733
(thudding)

19:30.803 --> 19:33.371
Plate breaks, skull okay.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.773
Kettle okay, skull breaks.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.610
Something always breaks.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.879
That's the shape of the world.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.818
(wind howling)

19:51.824 --> 19:54.759
(ominous music)

19:58.698 --> 20:01.432
- Did you mean what you said?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.266
- [Masha] A week?

20:02.268 --> 20:03.467
- Yes.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.535
- It's average.

20:06.606 --> 20:11.342
The longer you survive, the
longer you keep on surviving.

20:12.278 --> 20:12.977
- 10 years?

20:14.247 --> 20:14.946
- Prushka?

20:16.249 --> 20:18.716
(Masha chuckling)

20:18.718 --> 20:20.785
Two women, since I've been here.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.489
Two women have survived
their full sentence.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.795
I don't think they
had 10 years though.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.232
Svetlana could make it.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.703
Prushka, no chance.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.572
- And you?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.975
- What makes you think
I only got 10 years?

20:43.977 --> 20:46.010
- So you'll never leave.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.311
- I like it here.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.716
I used to vacation on
the shores of the Volga,

20:53.386 --> 20:57.355
a little dacha, with a
steam bath in the garden;

20:57.357 --> 20:58.789
there was a dock for fishing

20:59.659 --> 21:00.858
where we would...

21:06.399 --> 21:07.865
I'm done talking.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.902
(splashing)

21:11.904 --> 21:14.772
(wind howling)

21:16.576 --> 21:18.809
(huffing)

21:29.589 --> 21:32.490
(water trickling)

21:38.431 --> 21:41.032
(snow crunching)

21:41.968 --> 21:43.768
(ominous music)

21:43.770 --> 21:45.503
- [Soldier] Uh-uh.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.877
(chuckling)

21:56.883 --> 21:57.948
- Suka!

22:02.889 --> 22:04.855
(ominous music)

22:04.857 --> 22:09.460
(soldier speaking
foreign language)

22:10.697 --> 22:12.897
(chuckling)

22:12.899 --> 22:15.900
(solider spitting)

22:21.541 --> 22:24.075
(door thudding)

22:26.479 --> 22:28.913
The well froze between buckets.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.917
Tonight will be
colder than usual.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.390
- Has anyone ever escaped?

22:42.362 --> 22:44.628
- They try about once a month.

22:45.732 --> 22:46.964
- [Anastasia] Does
anyone make it?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.566
- None of them come back.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.847
(wind howling)

23:02.849 --> 23:04.849
- The problem is food.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.852
The guards only march the
fence line when the train comes

23:07.854 --> 23:09.687
to look good for the commissar.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.791
The rest of the month,
they don't bother.

23:13.793 --> 23:14.992
Where would you go?

23:14.994 --> 23:18.796
If they left the gate
open, who would walk out?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.831
To freeze in the snow or starve.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.169
Can you walk a hundred
miles with nothing to eat?

23:29.142 --> 23:30.674
- But some try anyway?

23:31.544 --> 23:32.777
- Sometimes they--

23:32.779 --> 23:33.844
- [Masha] Svetlana!

23:34.947 --> 23:35.946
- They try.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.581
Sometimes they try, anyway.

23:38.851 --> 23:39.784
- The problem is food.

23:39.786 --> 23:40.951
- [Svetlana] And the snow.

23:43.489 --> 23:45.055
- And Polina works
in the kitchen?

23:48.094 --> 23:49.493
- You're right, Svetlana,

23:51.631 --> 23:52.963
this will be interesting.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.034
(water splashing)

23:57.036 --> 24:00.104
(electrical buzzing)

24:06.813 --> 24:07.711
- Polina's late.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.948
- She will blunder in the dark,

24:10.950 --> 24:13.517
looking for a bunk
she's known for months

24:13.519 --> 24:14.618
and wake us all up.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.087
- Will she bring food?

24:17.089 --> 24:17.988
(chuckling)

24:17.990 --> 24:19.089
- Not for you.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.926
What have you done for Polina?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.861
She doesn't know you exist.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.663
(Lubov groaning)

24:25.665 --> 24:30.634
Hope Lubov gets better
and back up on her knees.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.503
- That's not why she asks.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.804
She's thinking, this one,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.840
thinking like a
rabbit in a snare.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.681
Sleep, krùshka.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.684
- A hundred miles
in which direction?

24:46.686 --> 24:49.086
- [Svetlana] South,
to the river.

24:51.524 --> 24:54.124
There are villages
all along the Sylva.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.227
- It's only 87 miles.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.696
- But a long way
to go on one beet.

24:59.966 --> 25:01.131
Better to sleep.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.003
Good night, Prushka.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.906
Good night, Svetlana.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.975
Good night, chaynik.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.244
- [Svetlana] Enough,
you're worse than the lice.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.846
- Goodnight, bliad.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.283
Try not to die.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.023
(fire crackling)

25:31.664 --> 25:32.963
- Why is Polina late?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.599
- What?

25:35.601 --> 25:37.167
- Why is Polina so late?

25:38.704 --> 25:40.671
With her scar, no guard
would look at her.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.573
- Maybe she got
caught stealing food.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.777
- We would have heard the shot.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.880
(gunshots booming)
(ominous music)

25:49.882 --> 25:51.949
(soldier screaming
foreign language)

25:51.951 --> 25:53.851
(rapid gunfire popping)

25:53.853 --> 25:54.952
- [Prushka] She's
running tonight!

25:54.954 --> 25:56.086
Polina!

25:56.088 --> 25:56.820
- [Svetlana] You knew this?

25:56.822 --> 25:57.855
- [Prushka] No.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.207
- That figures.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.558
The only person she tells is
the person who never talks.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.859
- [Prushka] I didn't know!

26:01.861 --> 26:03.093
- [Masha] That suka!

26:03.095 --> 26:03.894
- [Svetlana] Is she
at the fence yet?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.229
- [Masha] I can't tell.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.563
- The guards in the tower,
they never look straight down.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.032
If you're quiet,
you can go under it.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.701
But they will see you before
you get very far from the camp.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.069
- The guards in the kalanchá

26:12.071 --> 26:14.071
saw them going over
the fence line.

26:14.073 --> 26:14.939
Dogs in the morning.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.073
They got away.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.710
- If she gets past them...

26:19.712 --> 26:21.812
She will have taken
food for the journey.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.615
- There's still 87 miles
of Siberia out there.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.884
She left her blanket,
so the cold--

26:26.886 --> 26:29.019
- [Prushka] I want her blanket.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.789
- I want a dacha
with gold floors.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.894
Do you think they made it?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.195
- [Svetlana] The guns are quiet.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.064
- True.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.333
Why are they quiet?

26:42.335 --> 26:44.168
- Quiet is good.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.302
One way or another.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.138
If she went alone...

26:49.041 --> 26:50.274
Roll call tomorrow.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.809
- But none of us knew.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.979
- I'm sure they will
take that into account.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.113
- Oh that suka!

26:56.115 --> 26:57.948
She runs, we get punished!

26:57.950 --> 26:59.583
- If she went with others,

26:59.584 --> 27:01.217
there's another bunkhouse
involved, maybe two of them.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.653
They can't punish all of us.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.054
You know what I mean.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.724
They have to worry about
what it looks like.

27:06.726 --> 27:10.060
- [Prushka] But if she went
alone it all falls on us?

27:11.397 --> 27:14.164
- If she went, she
didn't go alone.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.265
- Then who was?

27:16.335 --> 27:17.267
Who could she go with?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.403
Who would be the avietchka?

27:19.405 --> 27:22.039
She'd starve without one.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.073
- I heard there was a new girl

27:23.075 --> 27:25.376
in the bunkhouse
near the latrine.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.978
Maybe if she was stupid.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.680
- [Prushka] She died.

27:29.682 --> 27:30.848
- [Svetlana] Sure?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.182
- Dysentary.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.817
Or TB.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.285
- It's not really the same.

27:35.287 --> 27:38.756
- One end or the other,
something was coming out.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.792
(chuckling)

27:41.794 --> 27:43.160
If not her then who?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.196
- Maybe it was her.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.298
Maybe Polina is the avietchka.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.199
- I don't believe it.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.701
- What is an avietchka?

27:50.703 --> 27:52.269
- It's a baby sheep.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.138
- I know what it means.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.039
Prushka?

27:56.742 --> 27:58.208
- I never told her.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.210
It's not my place to tell.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.012
- She ran alone.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.147
- With her leg?

28:04.216 --> 28:05.182
She limps.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.083
- Just a little.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.818
She's not that stupid.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.887
Tomorrow at the headcount

28:09.889 --> 28:12.456
we will have to
answer for her escape.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.457
- We need Yuri.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.260
- If he can help us.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.831
Maybe he can say she was
from another bunkhouse

28:20.833 --> 28:22.266
and then we won't
get beaten at all.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.867
Someone else can take it.

28:23.869 --> 28:24.802
- Lubov!

28:24.804 --> 28:26.136
- [Anastasia] She's sleeping.

28:26.138 --> 28:26.970
- [Svetlana] Still?

28:26.972 --> 28:28.238
- It's a healing sleep.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.040
The mind shuts down
for the body's sake.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.108
If we had vodka to--

28:31.110 --> 28:33.177
- Oh yes, I've got
some vodka on ice

28:33.179 --> 28:34.712
over here with the blinis.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.714
Maybe we can send your
servant into Moscow

28:36.716 --> 28:38.282
to get us another bottle!

28:38.284 --> 28:40.150
- In a day or two
we'll find out.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.319
- She doesn't have a day
or two, we work tomorrow.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.189
- Is there a sick
call or an infirmary?

28:45.191 --> 28:46.724
- Never mind the
fields tomorrow,

28:46.726 --> 28:48.092
we need her to work tonight!

28:48.094 --> 28:49.393
- She is sick!

28:52.932 --> 28:54.498
- You're the suka.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.466
We need her.

28:55.468 --> 28:56.900
- This is my fault?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.102
- [Svetlana] You kicked her.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.169
- [Masha] You said
not to touch her face,

28:59.171 --> 29:00.337
I didn't touch her face!

29:00.339 --> 29:01.271
- [Svetlana] You kicked
her in the belly,

29:01.273 --> 29:02.506
you think that's any better?

29:02.508 --> 29:03.807
- She walks around
here like she just--

29:03.809 --> 29:05.042
- Oh, and you do?

29:05.044 --> 29:06.343
- Stop this, both of you.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.746
- She is our one
chance to survive.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.013
- [Masha] You call
this survival?

29:10.015 --> 29:12.249
- She has done more
than you ever could.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.418
You think because you
are quick with your fist,

29:14.420 --> 29:15.953
because you have a
temper like a wolf bitch,

29:15.955 --> 29:18.188
that you mean anything here?!

29:18.190 --> 29:19.857
- Shut it, Svetlana.

29:19.859 --> 29:20.924
- You are nothing!

29:22.394 --> 29:23.227
Lubov!

29:23.229 --> 29:26.163
(ominous music)

29:27.233 --> 29:29.299
- Nothing, bliad?!

29:29.301 --> 29:30.300
Nothing, cow!

29:32.104 --> 29:33.337
(thudding)

29:33.339 --> 29:35.339
(gagging)

29:35.341 --> 29:36.340
You wanna fight now?!

29:36.342 --> 29:37.474
Can you feel this?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.446
(thudding)

29:42.448 --> 29:45.382
(ominous music)

29:48.988 --> 29:49.887
Nothing?!

29:51.991 --> 29:53.090
- I take it back.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.126
I take it back.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.495
Wake up, Lubov.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.330
(coughing)

30:00.332 --> 30:01.398
- [Anastasia] She can't.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.203
- It's a good thing you
helped your friends.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.272
They rely on you.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.075
(laughing)

30:12.077 --> 30:13.143
Alë,

30:13.145 --> 30:14.044
Lubov!

30:14.914 --> 30:16.446
Your boyfriend needs you!

30:16.448 --> 30:21.385
He needs you to make him
sweet like a sugar beet.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.454
Make him so happy

30:25.558 --> 30:29.026
that his whip hangs
as limp as his khren.

30:30.029 --> 30:30.928
Lubov!

30:31.597 --> 30:33.363
Wake up, sleepyhead.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.836
Good morning, krùshka.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.204
- Stop.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.305
- She can't.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.974
She can't do that,
she can barely walk.

30:45.344 --> 30:48.345
- Are you telling me what
she can and cannot do?

30:49.281 --> 30:50.414
- [Anastasia] Yes.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.385
- So you are volunteering.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.954
- What?

30:56.956 --> 30:58.355
- To go in her place.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.326
You are pretty, you are new.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.262
You're telling me the guards

31:05.264 --> 31:06.496
didn't notice you
when you came in?

31:09.435 --> 31:11.101
Did you see the sergeant?

31:12.371 --> 31:13.937
His name is Yuri.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.106
He sits in the guard
shack across the parade

31:16.108 --> 31:20.210
when the others are off
hunting Polina with the dogs

31:20.212 --> 31:22.145
and you will go to him,

31:22.147 --> 31:24.248
and you will tell him that Lubov

31:24.250 --> 31:25.983
is unavailable this evening.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.452
- Like hell I will.

31:28.454 --> 31:32.456
- You will do it or they
will beat you with a whip.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.958
- [Anastasia] I'll
take the whip.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.459
- They will also
beat me with the whip

31:35.461 --> 31:39.296
and Prushka and
Svetlana, even Lubov!

31:39.298 --> 31:41.932
They will drag her out
of her bed and beat her

31:41.934 --> 31:44.468
even if she's unable to feel it.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.787
Why?

31:46.788 --> 31:49.105
Because the rule of the
guard must be absolute.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.341
If they were to
forgive even one blow,

31:51.343 --> 31:53.310
who would respect them then?

31:53.312 --> 31:58.015
If I am beaten, I will take
it out on you, you know this.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.516
You have no friends here!

31:59.518 --> 32:01.318
You will go, chaynik!

32:01.320 --> 32:02.452
- No!

32:02.454 --> 32:03.553
- Anastasia?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.592
It would be easier if
you just give in now.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.194
- I will not.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.230
(smacking)
- Go!

32:13.232 --> 32:14.164
- [Anastasia] No!

32:16.568 --> 32:19.503
- You think there
are choices here?

32:19.505 --> 32:21.939
- There's always a choice.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.508
(thudding)

32:24.510 --> 32:26.310
(groaning)

32:26.312 --> 32:27.411
- Don't make this happen.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.181
Don't make us do this.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.121
(thudding)

32:38.123 --> 32:40.457
(groaning)

32:42.394 --> 32:45.462
(Anastasia gasping)

32:55.074 --> 32:57.441
- You can't make me do this.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.980
You can't make me do anything.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.716
You can hurt me or
you can kill me.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.685
But that is all.

33:10.055 --> 33:10.754
- Fair enough.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.460
(fire crackling)

33:20.199 --> 33:23.600
(dramatic violin music)

33:24.536 --> 33:26.603
- [Svetlana] Not her face!

33:28.707 --> 33:31.241
- Do you know why she
tells me that, chaynik?

33:34.446 --> 33:37.547
Because she knows this
is no idle threat.

33:37.549 --> 33:42.552
I'm not gonna wave this
around, make you scared.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.357
I'm gonna burn you.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.258
I don't want to

33:50.462 --> 33:52.262
but you will go to Yuri.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.134
You are too new to understand
that this is survival!

33:58.137 --> 33:58.802
- No, no.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.171
Help me.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.273
- This will help you.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.075
Just her feet.
- Don't do it.

34:05.077 --> 34:07.377
- Yuri doesn't care
about her feet.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.612
(thudding)

34:08.614 --> 34:11.547
(ominous music)

34:22.226 --> 34:23.126
- Stop it!

34:24.696 --> 34:26.063
I will go.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.466
- [Masha] At least
someone understands here.

34:31.703 --> 34:32.601
- You can't.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.139
- Who the hell are you?

34:37.141 --> 34:38.074
- I was a nurse.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.112
You cannot go in your condition.

34:42.114 --> 34:45.614
- Being whipped and beat
will be better for me?

34:45.617 --> 34:47.650
He can be gentle.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.652
It will not kill me
but tomorrow might.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.621
So I will go, help me up.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.393
- You are doing this to her.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.195
You.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.397
- I don't...

35:02.701 --> 35:04.501
I cannot do this.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.671
- I thought that
too a long time ago.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.677
(dog barking)

35:13.679 --> 35:15.545
- The guards in the
kalanchá missed.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.580
- She's out there.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.550
Running through snow.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.818
- Limping through snow.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.555
- And this is how it is?

35:26.859 --> 35:27.757
- Always.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.537
- Where's this guard shack?

35:41.640 --> 35:45.175
(electric buzzing)

35:45.177 --> 35:47.777
(snow crunching)

35:56.321 --> 35:58.855
(ominous music)

36:16.742 --> 36:19.409
(wind howling)

36:25.484 --> 36:28.852
(record player crackling)

36:38.230 --> 36:40.564
(knocking)

36:43.402 --> 36:44.367
- Yes?

36:52.411 --> 36:53.677
- I'm--
- The new girl.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.914
You've come to complain
about the accommodations?

36:59.218 --> 37:00.483
Is your bed too soft?

37:01.453 --> 37:05.288
- Lubov cannot be here.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.490
- Lubov, yes, of course.

37:07.492 --> 37:11.561
Little Lubov, she
is what, indisposed?

37:12.664 --> 37:13.563
- There was a...

37:14.700 --> 37:16.566
She had a...

37:16.568 --> 37:17.467
Yes.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.739
- And you came here
to tell me this?

37:22.741 --> 37:26.643
Not sure what I can do
for you but come in.

37:26.645 --> 37:27.544
Close the door.

37:35.687 --> 37:40.023
- [Svetlana] I've not heard
the dogs come back yet.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.360
- [Prushka] Do you
think Polina made it?

37:44.863 --> 37:45.762
- Why not?

37:47.899 --> 37:49.833
She took food from the kitchens.

37:52.571 --> 37:53.937
She's no avietchka.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.709
- You must be happy.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.380
- Me?

38:03.382 --> 38:04.748
- You shared your
bunk for 10 minutes.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.051
One leaves as another arrives.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.586
We're back to five again.

38:09.588 --> 38:13.857
- And you will take the
bunk near the stove.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.625
- Don't cook that chicken.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.061
It still has feathers.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.929
- Who will stop her?

38:19.931 --> 38:21.798
You are no longer
the shishka here.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.900
- Oh, so you say.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.304
- [Masha] You think Yuri will
not give his scraps of meat

38:27.306 --> 38:28.038
to the chaynik?

38:28.940 --> 38:30.807
- You know men better than that.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.577
You lost a lot more
than blood tonight.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.780
- I am unclear,

38:36.782 --> 38:39.049
at what point do
you get my bunk?

38:40.752 --> 38:41.885
- What do you mean?

38:41.887 --> 38:44.788
- You are not taking my place.

38:44.790 --> 38:45.889
She is.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.693
She will take my bunk
and grant you scraps

38:49.695 --> 38:51.361
to keep your fists at your side.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.937
- [Yuri] I would
offer you some but

39:02.808 --> 39:04.874
it is forbidden to have
such things in camp.

39:06.878 --> 39:10.647
To share with a prisoner.
(ominous music)

39:11.850 --> 39:13.917
Such a thing in itself
would be a crime.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.654
Sit down, please.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.526
Now you may ask,
where is the harm?

39:23.528 --> 39:25.528
Come in here where it is warm,

39:25.530 --> 39:26.863
have a little vodka.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.400
And a crime with no harm,

39:32.771 --> 39:33.937
is it really a crime?

39:36.041 --> 39:39.843
But if I was to sit
down with you here,

39:41.413 --> 39:44.748
soon I might become tempted.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.984
(eerie music)

39:54.893 --> 39:55.825
- She's weak.

39:57.396 --> 39:58.628
She's soft.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.796
- And Yuri will
keep her that way.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.832
He can have soft
hands on his khren.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.467
- What will you do?

40:04.469 --> 40:08.805
Kick her belly until
she curls up on a bunk,

40:08.807 --> 40:10.173
useless like Lubov?

40:10.175 --> 40:11.441
- Thanks.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.711
- Nothing changes here.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.945
- I'll kill her.

40:15.947 --> 40:16.813
- You can't.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.481
- Who'll stop me, you?!

40:19.718 --> 40:21.017
- We would.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.118
We need her.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.555
We don't have to stop you.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.023
You need her too.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.792
- Lubov will recover.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.928
- If there's another
bringing in extra food,

40:33.465 --> 40:35.999
I will take the cold
bunk and be happy.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.001
Yuri is a pig.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.936
- You will have nothing.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.704
You think she'd share with you?

40:43.842 --> 40:47.010
Without Yuri, you
are the weakest here.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.012
- How long will she last?

40:49.014 --> 40:50.980
- She'll do what she
has to to survive.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.583
- No, no she won't.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.487
She'll let him kill her first.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.988
- She went tonight.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.156
- Not because we beat her.

41:01.726 --> 41:04.894
She wouldn't give in, she's
more than all of us together.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.763
- Then why didn't
you hit her harder?

41:06.765 --> 41:08.198
- It wasn't us.
- Whose side are you on?!

41:08.200 --> 41:09.699
- It wasn't us.

41:10.502 --> 41:11.668
She went for Lubov.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.771
- She went because
she had no choice.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.506
- She's stronger
than you, Masha.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.080
When she comes back,
she'll have it all.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.783
- I can break her.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.051
- They won't let you.

41:28.053 --> 41:29.686
- They can't stop me!

41:29.688 --> 41:30.887
Even both of them.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.089
And you would be with me.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.892
We could destroy her easily.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.694
She's a bigger threat to you.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.265
- So we agree.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.735
There is no bed for her here.

41:45.737 --> 41:49.072
- You think we'll
just step back?

41:49.074 --> 41:51.774
(ominous music)

41:57.983 --> 41:59.048
- Name your price.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.886
- More food.

42:02.888 --> 42:03.987
We get some meat.

42:10.595 --> 42:11.528
- Masha said it.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.832
It's her or me.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.835
(foreboding music)

42:25.677 --> 42:27.143
- Am I then so dangerous?

42:27.145 --> 42:31.014
- The danger is that
you might tempt me to

42:31.016 --> 42:34.684
see you not as a
prisoner but as what?

42:36.888 --> 42:39.255
That was not a
rhetorical question.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.892
Are you so timid
you can't speak?

42:45.196 --> 42:47.230
- I don't know what to say.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.132
- So, silence.

42:49.134 --> 42:52.335
(somber string music)

43:09.921 --> 43:10.820
Good.

43:12.123 --> 43:14.190
If you had drunk the
vodka, you'd be dead now.

43:17.162 --> 43:19.963
(fire crackling)

43:22.834 --> 43:23.733
- Masha.

43:25.036 --> 43:26.202
Svetlana.

43:26.204 --> 43:27.637
You can't let her do this.

43:27.639 --> 43:31.140
- I'm not involved.

43:31.142 --> 43:35.144
(mne pó figu)

43:35.146 --> 43:36.379
- You know she's out there.

43:37.716 --> 43:40.149
You know what she's
doing for this bliad

43:40.151 --> 43:42.385
who would spread her legs
for 10 kopeks in a Mi--

43:42.387 --> 43:43.686
(thudding)

43:43.688 --> 43:46.189
- You survive because of me!

43:48.360 --> 43:51.160
Do you close your eyes
and leave your body

43:51.162 --> 43:54.364
as you eat what I provide
or do you taste it?

43:54.366 --> 43:57.033
Are you so precious

43:57.035 --> 44:00.169
and so untouched by
the filth I walk in?

44:06.077 --> 44:08.111
- You can't let her do this.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.249
- It is the shape of the world.

44:16.021 --> 44:17.420
I want to eat some real food.

44:18.390 --> 44:19.288
Meat.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.293
- And for that you
would let a woman die?

44:25.430 --> 44:27.830
- Something always breaks.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.799
Which one?

44:29.801 --> 44:30.867
Lubov?

44:30.869 --> 44:31.768
Anastasia?

44:33.071 --> 44:34.971
It doesn't make a
difference anymore.

44:34.973 --> 44:37.173
- It's nice to be appreciated.

44:38.209 --> 44:41.377
(dramatic music)

44:41.379 --> 44:42.278
- But why?

44:44.416 --> 44:46.382
Why does it have to
be either of them?

44:47.952 --> 44:50.086
Look, there is a
bunk right here.

44:50.088 --> 44:51.421
It's empty.

44:51.423 --> 44:53.890
Anastasia can just sleep here.

44:53.892 --> 44:55.892
There doesn't have
to be blood tonight.

44:57.462 --> 44:59.696
You don't even care if
it's Lubov or Anastasia

44:59.698 --> 45:01.698
who brings you
food, let them both.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.933
Let Yuri decide.

45:03.935 --> 45:04.834
Maybe they can.

45:07.305 --> 45:08.204
Lubov.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.709
Just talk to her.

45:12.711 --> 45:17.180
She's kind and she
has soft hands.

45:18.316 --> 45:20.249
There doesn't have to be blood--

45:20.251 --> 45:21.184
- She's kind.

45:24.289 --> 45:25.722
She's soft.

45:27.258 --> 45:30.093
In a week, she'll
be hard like Masha.

45:30.095 --> 45:32.128
She will be cold and
careless like Svetlana.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.130
She will be ripped
apart inside like...

45:36.768 --> 45:37.900
I will take her now

45:39.204 --> 45:41.437
while she's kind,
while she is soft.

45:43.441 --> 45:45.374
When she walks in from the cold.

45:49.114 --> 45:50.012
From Yuri.

45:51.316 --> 45:53.950
From her first time
with a man she despises

45:53.952 --> 45:57.120
because her eyes will
only look at the floor.

45:57.122 --> 45:58.354
She will see nothing.

45:58.356 --> 46:01.424
It will be quick and
that will be kind.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.535
(somber music)

46:18.343 --> 46:19.809
- I won't let you.

46:19.811 --> 46:21.010
- [Svetlana]
Prushka, be careful.

46:21.012 --> 46:21.978
- [Prushka] I mean it.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.346
- How will you stop me?

46:24.916 --> 46:27.383
I will cut you, Prushka.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.018
- You're weak.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.354
You're still bleeding,
you can hardly stand.

46:31.356 --> 46:34.123
(groaning)

46:34.125 --> 46:36.859
(ominous music)

46:37.796 --> 46:39.228
- You know, for someone who

46:40.431 --> 46:43.065
wanted everyone to sit
and talk like old friends,

46:43.067 --> 46:45.268
you seem determined to see
two dead women tonight,

46:45.270 --> 46:47.837
are you sure you want
to join Anastasia?

46:47.839 --> 46:49.372
- Don't kill her, Lubov.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.242
Just cut her a little.

46:54.212 --> 46:55.278
- I will fight you.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.979
- Ah.

46:56.981 --> 47:01.083
I guess with Polina gone, we
need another scarred face!

47:01.085 --> 47:04.487
(suspenseful music)

47:04.489 --> 47:07.156
(whimpering)

47:11.229 --> 47:14.163
(ominous music)

47:16.434 --> 47:20.937
(thudding)
(groaning)

47:20.939 --> 47:23.372
(Lubov crying)

47:29.147 --> 47:31.848
- So, you understand
the danger here?

47:32.917 --> 47:35.918
Not to you, your
life has no meaning.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.588
It's a fact.

47:38.590 --> 47:40.523
The danger here is that

47:40.525 --> 47:43.559
I must maintain my role,

47:44.963 --> 47:47.096
my responsibility

47:47.098 --> 47:50.867
to my men, to the integrity
of this institution,

47:52.003 --> 47:55.972
and you threaten that
by your mere presence.

47:57.308 --> 47:59.075
I am rather fond of Lubov.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.178
I like her.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.480
Much like a man likes a dog

48:04.482 --> 48:09.552
but if even for one moment
I was to think of her as

48:10.288 --> 48:11.220
a person,

48:13.057 --> 48:14.924
life here would
become unbearable.

48:16.261 --> 48:18.628
And you,
(gun clicking)

48:18.630 --> 48:19.595
you sit here,

48:21.165 --> 48:25.101
your skin still
pink and healthy.

48:27.939 --> 48:30.206
You are a person

48:31.442 --> 48:32.341
still.

48:35.346 --> 48:38.014
(knuckle crackling)

48:38.016 --> 48:40.249
And that is unacceptable.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.619
(ominous music)

48:46.424 --> 48:47.323
So,

48:48.359 --> 48:49.458
some music.

48:56.935 --> 49:00.569
(pleasant instrumental music)

49:08.146 --> 49:11.514
- Hope you enjoy that
warm bunk while you can.

49:11.516 --> 49:13.516
Might even get a
whole night in it.

49:19.357 --> 49:21.590
- You think you will
be better by tomorrow?

49:26.064 --> 49:29.498
Tomorrow you'll be in
the fields with us.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.367
Or scrubbing tubs
in the laundry,

49:32.203 --> 49:33.536
holding your belly

49:33.538 --> 49:35.972
while the blood
spills down your legs.

49:37.008 --> 49:38.074
Without Yuri--

49:40.278 --> 49:42.178
- You better sleep
with one eye open.

49:45.116 --> 49:48.150
- I do not need
you alive anymore.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.051
- Masha.

49:50.288 --> 49:51.187
Put it down.

49:51.189 --> 49:55.358
- While Anastasia
lives, you do not exist.

49:55.360 --> 50:01.297
You are nothing but a wounded
belly and bad memories.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.633
- So give me the knife.

50:05.770 --> 50:08.304
- [Masha] I already
have the warm bunk.

50:08.306 --> 50:09.605
- Only for now.

50:11.075 --> 50:13.209
You give me the knife,
you can keep it.

50:14.045 --> 50:16.212
- [Masha] This is our trade?

50:16.214 --> 50:17.780
- What about--
- Your made your deal.

50:19.751 --> 50:24.553
We step back, she
brings us real meat.

50:31.162 --> 50:35.064
(pleasant instrumental music)

50:37.468 --> 50:42.271
- For me to do my job, I must
ceaselessly guard against

50:42.273 --> 50:47.309
sympathy, rapport, all of those
conditions that are human,

50:48.079 --> 50:49.612
that make us human.

50:51.482 --> 50:53.582
That's how I survive.

50:53.584 --> 50:57.186
(pleasant instrumental music)

50:57.188 --> 50:58.554
Do you even understand?

50:58.556 --> 51:03.492
To remain human myself,
for my very survival,

51:04.662 --> 51:06.762
I must act inhumanly.

51:10.435 --> 51:12.701
Man's inhumanity to man is

51:14.205 --> 51:17.573
nothing compared to man's
inhumanity to woman.

51:20.511 --> 51:21.610
So,

51:23.481 --> 51:26.415
you come to me in Lubov's place.

51:28.653 --> 51:29.552
For what?

51:31.289 --> 51:32.521
To engage in congress?

51:34.092 --> 51:38.661
This will be an experience from
which you will not recover.

51:40.164 --> 51:41.630
By design,

51:41.632 --> 51:43.666
by careful considered
design of a man,

51:43.668 --> 51:47.336
who, himself, is merely trying
to survive in a dark place.

51:51.142 --> 51:51.807
Shall we begin?

51:55.179 --> 51:58.180
- [Anastasia] There
is another choice.

51:58.182 --> 52:01.117
(instrumental music)

52:01.119 --> 52:01.884
(record scratching)

52:01.886 --> 52:05.654
(thudding)
(screaming)

52:05.656 --> 52:08.557
(gunshot booming)

52:11.629 --> 52:14.463
(groaning)

52:14.465 --> 52:15.798
- She won't even wake up.

52:20.538 --> 52:22.605
- She did nothing but help you.

52:22.607 --> 52:23.839
- She tried to usurp me.

52:24.709 --> 52:25.875
It's only survival.

52:27.445 --> 52:29.445
You say one word, I will
come for you in the night,

52:29.447 --> 52:30.412
do you understand?

52:33.184 --> 52:34.483
- Yes.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.551
- You will be quiet?

52:37.855 --> 52:38.821
- Like a mouse.

52:41.859 --> 52:44.793
(door clicking)

52:45.630 --> 52:48.764
(footsteps thumping)

52:57.642 --> 53:00.376
(water sloshing)

53:26.704 --> 53:28.671
- Are you going to sleep?

53:32.677 --> 53:34.610
- There's no shame
in this place.

53:36.881 --> 53:40.583
The walls, the guards, the dogs.

53:42.353 --> 53:43.519
It's only survival.

53:44.488 --> 53:45.754
You do what you have to.

53:47.658 --> 53:48.824
- You do what you have to.

53:51.262 --> 53:51.961
- Lubov.

53:53.798 --> 53:54.697
- What?

53:55.666 --> 53:56.799
- Tell Anastasia.

54:01.539 --> 54:05.241
You know these things,
speak words of comfort.

54:06.444 --> 54:07.676
Tell her.

54:07.678 --> 54:09.778
- I have no words for her.

54:12.817 --> 54:16.018
- That's because she too
must find a way to survive.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.853
That is why all of us are here.

54:21.859 --> 54:23.626
But if she could talk

54:25.563 --> 54:26.662
she would tell you...

54:28.366 --> 54:29.265
What?

54:32.670 --> 54:36.972
That the skin can grow so
tough nothing penetrates.

54:39.744 --> 54:41.543
Not the groping of men's hands.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.313
Not the cutting of their whips.

54:45.750 --> 54:46.649
Or that

54:47.985 --> 54:49.351
there is a place

54:50.688 --> 54:51.954
where men can not touch you.

54:53.924 --> 54:56.792
A place where you
can remain inviolate,

54:59.330 --> 55:00.796
so deep inside,

55:02.867 --> 55:03.766
behind fences

55:05.436 --> 55:06.969
dogs and guards.

55:09.707 --> 55:14.677
Behind a thousand kalanchás.
(dramatic music)

55:14.679 --> 55:17.880
Across the 87 miles
of frozen wasteland.

55:21.786 --> 55:23.952
And there you can
stay for years.

55:28.893 --> 55:31.794
Are these the words
she's looking for?

55:33.798 --> 55:34.997
What would she tell you,

55:36.834 --> 55:39.668
if she could cry out from
inside such a deep place?

55:50.848 --> 55:52.381
- I'm sorry!

55:52.383 --> 55:53.415
(groaning)

55:53.417 --> 55:55.117
(thudding)

55:55.119 --> 55:56.018
- Is that?

55:56.821 --> 55:59.755
(ominous music)

56:02.693 --> 56:04.927
(electric buzzing)
(women groaning)

56:04.929 --> 56:07.029
(thudding)

56:10.801 --> 56:13.869
(gun clicking)
- Back away!

56:13.871 --> 56:14.970
- You took his gun!

56:16.841 --> 56:19.875
You stupid woman,
you took Yuri's gun!

56:19.877 --> 56:20.709
- [Anastasia] He
wasn't using it.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.378
- What have you done?

56:22.380 --> 56:23.145
- Yuri is dead.

56:24.014 --> 56:26.382
- No, no, no.
- He is dead.

56:26.384 --> 56:27.850
- They will shoot us.

56:27.852 --> 56:29.017
They will shoot us in the head!

56:29.019 --> 56:30.919
- We won't be here.

56:30.921 --> 56:31.754
- You're crazy.

56:31.756 --> 56:32.921
- Where are the dogs?

56:32.923 --> 56:35.057
Following Polina's
trail far from the camp.

56:35.059 --> 56:36.959
Most of the guards
are with them.

56:36.961 --> 56:38.093
I will run.

56:38.095 --> 56:39.695
- [Svetlana] Past the kalanchá?

56:39.697 --> 56:42.631
- Under it, quietly
like you told me.

56:42.633 --> 56:44.633
South to the river, the Sylva.

56:44.635 --> 56:45.467
87 miles.

56:45.469 --> 56:46.702
- You'll never make it.

56:46.704 --> 56:47.636
- [Anastasia] The
best time to escape

56:47.638 --> 56:48.971
is as soon as you are captured.

56:48.973 --> 56:50.806
- You'll freeze in the snow.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.007
- I'll take blankets

56:53.511 --> 56:54.910
and I'll take Prushka.

56:54.912 --> 56:56.445
- What?

56:56.447 --> 56:59.148
- One persona may freeze,
two together, not so much.

56:59.150 --> 57:01.450
Three, never.

57:01.452 --> 57:02.985
We could survive the snow.

57:02.987 --> 57:04.453
- We escape together tonight.

57:04.455 --> 57:06.121
- Svetlana, can you run?

57:06.123 --> 57:07.122
- I can run.

57:07.124 --> 57:08.824
- Then we run, all of us.

57:08.826 --> 57:10.559
Polina has thrown off the dogs.

57:10.561 --> 57:11.960
We have a moment

57:11.962 --> 57:13.896
while the guards' eyes
are turned elsewhere.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.864
We can run if we run together.

57:15.866 --> 57:16.999
- You killed a guard.

57:18.436 --> 57:19.601
- I killed a pig.

57:20.938 --> 57:24.673
Lubov, Yuri lies with his
brains steaming on the floor.

57:24.675 --> 57:26.208
Will you run with us?

57:27.778 --> 57:28.877
- [Masha] How far will she get?

57:28.879 --> 57:29.745
She can't walk!

57:29.747 --> 57:31.013
- I will get far enough!

57:31.015 --> 57:32.848
- [Masha] You will
die in the snow.

57:32.850 --> 57:34.683
- And you will die on your knees

57:34.685 --> 57:36.752
with a bullet in the
back of your skull.

57:39.590 --> 57:42.458
They find Yuri's body,
they come straight to us.

57:42.460 --> 57:43.525
- To us?

57:43.527 --> 57:44.860
She's one of us?

57:44.862 --> 57:46.195
She did this, her!

57:46.197 --> 57:47.095
- I know.

57:48.933 --> 57:50.899
- She makes the decision for us.

57:50.901 --> 57:52.935
- She's the only one who
had the choice to make.

57:52.937 --> 57:54.503
We are prisoners.

57:54.505 --> 57:55.637
- You will go in the snow?

57:55.639 --> 57:57.039
- We are going!

58:03.080 --> 58:04.680
- And who is the avietchka?

58:10.554 --> 58:11.753
Is it you, Prushka?

58:12.623 --> 58:13.522
Svetlana?

58:15.025 --> 58:15.924
Lubov?

58:16.961 --> 58:18.126
You do not know.

58:19.697 --> 58:23.165
- She said Prushka
first, before any other.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.200
She said Prushka.

58:26.770 --> 58:30.105
- But I know, I'm no
stupid chaynik, I know.

58:30.107 --> 58:32.274
Lubov will fall, she's sick.

58:36.947 --> 58:39.915
- If you do not know who
the avietchka is, it is you.

58:41.952 --> 58:44.520
- You think I only
asked Prushka as a lamb?

58:47.725 --> 58:50.158
- [Masha] I thought you didn't
know what that word meant.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.060
- Avietchka.

58:52.930 --> 58:55.163
A little lamb, the sacrifice.

58:55.165 --> 58:56.231
Is it not obvious?

58:57.568 --> 59:00.168
The one who escapes
only to make it halfway?

59:01.972 --> 59:05.007
The chaynik who is told of a
great opportunity and takes it

59:07.611 --> 59:09.177
only to discover the others

59:09.179 --> 59:11.146
had their plans
for her all along.

59:12.283 --> 59:14.850
The question is food.

59:14.852 --> 59:17.119
And the answer is what
the answer always is,

59:18.656 --> 59:22.824
we are animals and that in
the end we turn on each other.

59:24.028 --> 59:25.761
Throw Lubov to the
men in the guard shack

59:25.763 --> 59:28.030
like a scrap of meat
to the wolves, why not?

59:29.033 --> 59:30.198
It's for survival.

59:32.703 --> 59:33.602
Fight,

59:35.239 --> 59:37.205
kill each other

59:38.943 --> 59:40.576
over the warmth of a stove.

59:41.979 --> 59:43.779
Of course it's for survival.

59:44.715 --> 59:47.316
(dramatic music)

59:48.786 --> 59:50.118
I refuse to survive.

59:53.057 --> 59:54.056
But I will live.

59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.095
- Survival is all there is here.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.098
You want to live, go.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.167
Live in the cold, in the snow.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.105
Live for one night
and freeze to death.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.207
I will survive her
where I belong.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:13.709
- What did you do, Masha?

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.012
Why are you the only
one in this place

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.380
who deserves to be here?

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:19.381
- You do not know?

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.752
You can not remember
what happened?

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.088
- It is not for me to
remember, it is you, Masha.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.758
You tell us why you are here.

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:32.728
- I told you.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.964
I loved my husband
even when he hit me.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:40.202
I told you all my secrets.

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.269
Tell us.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.705
- You sent me to
Yuri like a pimp.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:49.077
You ate the food that I earned

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:52.014
even when it tasted
of his sweat.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:55.283
Tell me.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.054
- Tell us, maybe then
you can come with us

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.822
and we leave nothing behind.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:03.692
- I stole an apple.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:04.393
- Tell us.

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.229
Think of it as a
matter of survival.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:09.431
- [Svetlana] Tell us.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:16.438
- We are murderers, you and I.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:18.206
Don't you remember?

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.677
- No, there was only
one, there was--

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:22.377
- Only one.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:24.246
You don't.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:25.080
- Who?

01:01:25.082 --> 01:01:26.181
- My son!

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:28.817
My beautiful boy!

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:31.386
He was five years old

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:35.023
with hair...

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:37.959
like straw.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:42.397
His hair floating around
his beautiful face.

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:47.803
He floated away

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:50.005
and I never saw him.

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:55.043
How can you not remember this?

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.380
- I killed my husband.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:00.982
- [Masha] I know.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.985
- And for that I go free.

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:07.456
- For what I did, I stay here.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.186
Anastasia?

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.791
Which one is the lamb?

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:48.797
In the cold, with no
food and miles to go.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.967
Who will you sacrifice
for the others?

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:54.836
- None of them.

01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:58.507
- You can not all survive.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:03.411
- I will not
sacrifice any of them.

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:06.314
- Then yourself?

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.216
- No.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.353
I am no lamb.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.868
(ominous music)

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:53.128
(footsteps crunching)

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:06.408
(rustling)
Who's there?

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:10.278
Lubov?

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.347
(rustling)

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.248
Svetlana?

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:18.353
(rustling)

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.454
Svetlana?

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.528
Is that you, Prushka?

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.496
Did you come all
this way with me?

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.100
(rustling)

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.637
I can not see you in the dark?

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:38.473
Why don't you speak?

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.014
Evgeny?

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:49.050
No.

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:53.388
No, I killed you,
you can't be him.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:59.160
But you have his eyes.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.464
How long have I been
running in the snow?

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:06.001
(somber music)

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:08.570
Has it been 87 miles yet?

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.505
- You don't know me?

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:14.276
- How could I not
know my own son?

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:15.176
Ivan.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.314
Let me look at you.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:20.382
You've grown.

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:22.550
You...

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.455
No, you...

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.426
You can not be Ivan.

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:35.330
He was only a child.

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.535
- [Ivan] I was five years
old when you killed Papa.

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:42.971
- Five years old

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:47.475
with hair like,

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.679
like straw.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:06:00.155
- I had to shield you from him.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:01.423
From becoming what he was.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.295
- That was your choice to make.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:09.464
They sent me to Leningrad

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.334
to live with grandpapa.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:17.439
I spent 12 years on his boat.

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:18.506
I'm a fisherman now.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.476
- 12 years?

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.377
No.

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:25.480
I ran the first night.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.349
I fought a guard, you
would've been proud.

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.384
I defended my honor.

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:33.288
We ran the first night
while my hands were soft.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.590
- Your hands are not soft.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:37.592
- No.

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.196
- [Ivan] And they
have blood on them.

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:45.600
- What have they
done to my hands?

01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:47.702
- [Ivan] You served 12 years.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:52.007
- No one survives 12 years.

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:55.744
- [Ivan] You survived,
you were in isolation.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.181
(dramatic music)

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.550
- [Svetlana] Here a
week can be a lifetime

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:06.454
and the night can drag
on for longer than that.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.056
(groaning)

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:10.458
(door thudding)

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.659
You are in isolation.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.098
That is why all of us are here.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.501
She must find a way to survive.

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:23.772
- [Prushka] She's more
than all of us together.

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:26.541
(whip cracking)
(groaning)

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.510
- [Lubov] She will
be hard like Masha.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:32.781
She will be cold and
careless like Svetlana.

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:36.051
She will be ripped
apart inside like...

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:39.821
- [Masha] It's for survival.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:42.557
Everything is.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.461
(dramatic music)

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:51.599
- [Svetlana] There are
places men can not touch.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:56.671
Places so deep inside that
there you can stay for years.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.240
What would you say

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:03.812
if you could cry out from
inside such a deep place.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:06.781
- [Lubov] I am sorry.

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:12.620
- You said you would come back.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.792
- I never lost you.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:20.495
(dramatic music)

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:23.231
Masha held you in her heart

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:27.734
when I was too
scared, too broken.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.106
She was the one who could.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:36.310
- [Masha] His hair
floating in front of me.

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:39.613
- So I never lost you.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:44.819
I dreamt of you every night.

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:53.161
- You never forgot me?

01:08:55.866 --> 01:08:57.631
- I'm your mother.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.404
(steam hissing)

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:09.477
For what I've done, I go free.
(whistle blowing)

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:26.861
(train horn blowing)

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:29.796
(steam hissing)

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.643
(dramatic string music)

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:50.445
(dramatic string music)

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:56.544
(dramatic string music)
