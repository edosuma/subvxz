Good luck to you both.

27:58.376 --> 27:59.978

28:01.346 --> 28:03.248
{\an3}Garth became
my responsibility.

28:03.314 --> 28:05.617
{\an3}There's many levels
to autism,

28:05.683 --> 28:07.619
and people don't realize that,

28:07.685 --> 28:10.688

with autism aren't normal.

28:21.399 --> 28:24.502

28:24.569 --> 28:26.638

28:26.704 --> 28:30.742

in our relationship.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.410

a picture of a boy

28:32.477 --> 28:34.179

28:34.245 --> 28:37.115
{\an3}with headphones on,
and books around the tree.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.384
{\an3}Books and music are Garth's
favorite things,

28:39.451 --> 28:42.987

the innocence of a child.

the best for them.

29:05.610 --> 29:06.678

one of your boys,

36:11.836 --> 36:13.905
{\an1}- Yeah.

36:13.971 --> 36:18.476
{\an1}I'm sorry I didn't finish it.
I really tried.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.011
- All right, Portland.

36:20.077 --> 36:22.647
It's the moment that we've
all been waiting for.

36:22.713 --> 36:26.050
Voting is officially open.
Let's check out these tattoos.

36:26.117 --> 36:29.820
[cheers and applause]

36:32.089 --> 36:34.025
{\an3}- I think what I tried to do
was give him the best

36:34.091 --> 36:37.061
{\an3}12-hour tattoo I possibly
could in six hours.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.996
{\an1}- I've got to say, adding
the color with it--

36:39.063 --> 36:42.033
{\an1}having the contrast--
really helps pop it out.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.434
It's really beautiful.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.902
- Thank you.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.572
<i>- I voted for Ryan,</i>

36:47.638 --> 36:49.807
because her tattoo was
so meticulous in its detail,

36:49.874 --> 36:54.445
<i>and the shading really gave it</i>
<i>this three-dimensional pop.</i>

36:54.512 --> 36:57.148
{\an9}- The detail down in the
diamond is incredible.

36:57.214 --> 36:58.816
- I really like
the music notes.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.986
They're so small and clean.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.654
- Thank you so much.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.290
- I voted for Austin because
I really liked the contrast

37:06.357 --> 37:08.426
between the geometric shape
of that diamond

37:08.492 --> 37:10.461
<i>and the little natural shape</i>
<i>of the tree.</i>

37:10.528 --> 37:12.863
And I really liked how he was
able to bring so much depth

37:12.930 --> 37:15.032
in a shape that was so skinny.

37:16.334 --> 37:17.935
- It really is
a great start.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.971
{\an3}- Yeah, it is.
It's still the best tattoo

37:20.037 --> 37:22.239
I've ever had.
- Where's the rest of it?

37:22.306 --> 37:23.441
[laughs]

37:23.507 --> 37:25.109
- I didn't finish it.
You didn't know?

37:25.176 --> 37:29.113
- No, I've been over here
stressing the [bleep] out.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.349
- Ryan's tattoo had
a lot of potential.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.618
<i>- I love the face</i>
<i>on the dragon.</i>

37:33.684 --> 37:35.119
<i>It has that passionate,</i>

37:35.186 --> 37:37.054
<i>protective energy to it.</i>

37:37.121 --> 37:38.723
- Ryan's piece
was more complex.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.525
- It sucks, 'cause, like,
what do you do with, like,

37:41.592 --> 37:44.962
60% of a gorgeous tattoo...
- Right.

37:45.029 --> 37:49.467
{\an1}- Versus something
so much less complex?

37:49.533 --> 37:51.435
{\an3}- Austin did pull off
a good piece.

37:51.502 --> 37:53.871
<i>From across the room,</i>
<i>you know exactly what it is.</i>

37:53.938 --> 37:55.206
<i>You know that it's a tree.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

37:55.272 --> 37:57.041
<i>His lines were clean,</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:59.243
<i>and there were a lot of</i>
<i>nice little details.</i>

37:59.310 --> 38:00.778
- It's gonna be a really
tough decision.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.447
- It is.

38:03.514 --> 38:06.050
{\an1}- As we feared,
Ryan didn't finish.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.619
{\an1}But I do like
the position of the dragon,

38:08.686 --> 38:12.056
<i>and she gave us the</i>
<i>cool colors within those wings</i>

38:12.123 --> 38:13.557
<i>so you can have</i>
<i>that glow effect.</i>

38:13.624 --> 38:17.094
<i>- Ryan went for it</i>
<i>on every level.</i>

38:17.161 --> 38:19.697
{\an3}But then we have someone
who played it so safe,

38:19.764 --> 38:22.099
<i>but I recognize it as a tree--</i>

38:22.166 --> 38:23.668
<i>as a kid under the tree.</i>

38:23.734 --> 38:26.070
<i>- He did tell a story</i>
<i>successfully.</i>

38:26.137 --> 38:28.072
{\an1}You can tell
what the tattoo's about.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.440
- This competition went ways

38:29.507 --> 38:31.208
that I don't think
any of us expected.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.411
{\an3}- That's kind of the name
of the game, you guys.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.148
All right, Portland.

38:37.214 --> 38:39.116
{\an3}Are you ready
to find out who won?

38:39.183 --> 38:42.420
[cheers and applause]

38:43.220 --> 38:44.655
- If Austin beats Ryan,

38:44.722 --> 38:47.892
{\an1}that means he secures
his spot on "Ink Master."

38:47.958 --> 38:51.195
[cheers and applause]

38:53.898 --> 38:56.534
- The decision
was unanimous.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.036
crowd: Ooh!

39:00.371 --> 39:03.641
{\an1}- The winner of
the Angel Face-off is...

39:06.911 --> 39:08.746
- I can only sweat so much.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.014
- Austin.

39:10.081 --> 39:13.317
[cheers and applause]

39:20.291 --> 39:21.525
<i>- This was just the beginning.</i>

39:21.592 --> 39:23.027
<i>I want to become</i>
<i>an Ink Master.</i>

39:23.094 --> 39:24.495
<i>I know it's not gonna be easy,</i>

39:24.562 --> 39:25.963
but I've never been scared
of hard work.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.331
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

39:27.398 --> 39:28.733
- Yes.
- I'm happy you won.

39:28.799 --> 39:30.434
And I am so excited to see

39:30.501 --> 39:31.869
{\an3}what they have
in store for you.

39:31.936 --> 39:34.371
{\an1}- Yeah, I'm sure you are.
[laughs]

39:34.438 --> 39:36.040
<i>- I'm fine with losing.</i>

39:36.107 --> 39:37.675
I got knocked on my ass
a little bit--

39:37.742 --> 39:39.176
not by Austin,

39:39.243 --> 39:41.245
but by myself
and my own ambition.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.780
- Honestly, you had
an amazing tattoo.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.014
It just didn't get finished.

39:44.081 --> 39:45.182
If you would've finished,

39:45.249 --> 39:46.951
{\an1}I would've gone home,
guaranteed.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.186
{\an3}- I don't believe a single word
that comes out of your mouth.

39:49.253 --> 39:52.156
Today, I'm truly humbled

39:52.223 --> 39:55.493
and shocked and disappointed

39:55.559 --> 39:58.028
<i>that I couldn't be</i>
<i>the tattooer on the pedestal</i>

39:58.095 --> 39:59.663
<i>that everybody puts me on.</i>

39:59.730 --> 40:03.300
And I remembered how
hard tattooing is.

40:03.367 --> 40:05.136
{\an3}- Now the real
competition's here.

40:05.202 --> 40:07.638
- Oh, this was nothing.
- [laughing] I know.
