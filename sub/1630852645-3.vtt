19:06.346 --> 19:08.079
- You're not going anywhere.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.621
Oh. I sat in the wrong chair.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.556
- Nope!
It looks like you're the one

19:18.625 --> 19:19.857
that's not going anywhere.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.392
See ya.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.960
- Halt, Evildoer!

19:23.029 --> 19:25.029
Oh, I've always wanted
to say that.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.698
- Ha-ha, you can't stop me!

19:27.767 --> 19:29.300
- Darby, do you have anything
in your fanny pack

19:29.369 --> 19:31.369
that could help us stop him?
- I don't have a fanny pack,

19:31.437 --> 19:34.605
but I can check
my utility belt!

19:34.674 --> 19:38.042
How about some air freshener?
- Oh, perfect.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.578
- Oh!
Lavender Ocean Breeze!

19:40.647 --> 19:42.547
That's the worst.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.082
- I'll take it from here.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.659
- Hey, we used the fanny pack
to catch a criminal!

19:54.727 --> 19:57.695
Which I think officially
makes it a utility belt.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.963
- Finally.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.665
Vindication!

20:03.303 --> 20:05.703
- Okay, Hurley.
I think that's enough.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.506
- I know.
I can't turn it off.

- And so, after we caught
the guy,

20:19.652 --> 20:21.452
we got the store's money back
and used it to buy

20:21.521 --> 20:24.655
this authentic copy
of "Dr. Genesis" 37

20:24.724 --> 20:26.190
which I was able to get
for cheap from one

20:26.259 --> 20:27.625
of my connections.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.027
- So you knew that this comic
was fake the whole time?

20:30.096 --> 20:31.495
- Of course.
We were just setting up

20:31.564 --> 20:33.664
that whole situation
to catch that guy.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.299
- Then why didn't you tell me
what was going on?

20:35.368 --> 20:37.435
- We had to keep it a secret
to protect you

20:37.503 --> 20:40.037
and not compromise the mission.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.906
- I am very impressed
with you two.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.274
That's some next-level stuff.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.143
- So you're not gonna fire us?
Or just Milo?

20:46.212 --> 20:49.046
- What?
No, why would you say that?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.381
- Because you said to think
of you as someone

20:50.450 --> 20:52.550
who could fire us.
- No, I said to think of me

20:52.619 --> 20:53.651
as a friend.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.286
- See? I told you.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.655
- Who could also fire you.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.190
Now if you'll excuse me,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.826
I gotta go home
and feed my Venus flytrap.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.728
If she doesn't eat by 4:00,

21:03.796 --> 21:06.731
she gets hangry.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.432
- Is that a jet pack?

21:08.501 --> 21:12.336
- Yep, I can't remember where
I parked my pogo stick.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.307
- How fast does it go?
- And how high?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.209
- Oh, it doesn't actually work.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.011
There's no such thing
as a jet pack...

21:20.079 --> 21:21.646
yet.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.948
Until then, I'm just gonna run
home and pretend.

21:24.017 --> 21:28.085
Wilson awayyy!

21:30.256 --> 21:31.489
- Interesting guy.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.891
- I can't believe
this fake, worthless comic

21:33.960 --> 21:35.526
caused us so much trouble.

21:35.595 --> 21:39.196
We should get rid of it so it
can't cause any more problems.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.970
This is the real one, isn't it?

21:46.039 --> 21:48.806
- It was.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.308
- Do you have any tape?

21:51.377 --> 21:54.145
- Wilson the other wayyy!
