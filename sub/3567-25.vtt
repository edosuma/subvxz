- Steven, I told you I can't

00:31.396 --> 00:33.531
hang out today.
I have tennis practice.

What's summer vacation?

00:43.275 --> 00:45.943
You know, when school
gets out for the summer?

00:46.011 --> 00:49.647
I've never been to this ...
how do you say? ...

00:49.748 --> 00:52.500
School?
How does it work?

00:52.584 --> 00:54.452
It's a place where you go to learn.

00:54.536 --> 00:57.162
- It's full of desks, chalkboards ...
- Hmm.

00:57.163 --> 00:59.957
- ... books, maps.
- I see.

01:01.510 --> 01:05.596
- Yep, it's all coming together.
- So, how do we

01:05.630 --> 01:09.884
- begin our "school"?
- Uh ... I ...

01:09.968 --> 01:12.520
I don't know. This is
everything Connie told me.

01:12.604 --> 01:14.972
Why do I never ask
follow-up questions?!

01:15.023 --> 01:19.443
Who will teach little Stevie now?!

01:19.478 --> 01:22.980
Teach you?!
Steven, if only I had known

01:23.031 --> 01:26.377
that's what you really wanted.

01:27.628 --> 01:29.501
Twooow!

It's just you in there.

01:57.015 --> 01:59.984

- Whoa!

02:12.307 --> 02:14.558
I know you've seen it.

02:14.643 --> 02:18.045
It is in pretty rough shape.
It must finally be broken.

02:18.113 --> 02:22.368
- What a shame.
- Doesn't seem broken to me.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.219
Oh, well. I guess
that's the end of our school.

02:25.287 --> 02:30.091
Whoa. Wha ...
So you could say ...

02:30.256 --> 02:33.865
- school's out for summer?
- Yes. Good, Steven.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.448
There are many ways
to say the same thing.

02:35.483 --> 02:37.289
School's out!

02:37.290 --> 02:41.135
Hmm. The asymmetry of this
pile is really starting to bother me.

02:41.219 --> 02:45.639
School's out!

02:45.674 --> 02:47.855
Happy summer vacation, Steven.

02:47.856 --> 02:52.062
Happy summer vacation, Beach City!
Yeah!

02:52.180 --> 02:55.182

Are you excited for summer?
I'm so excited for summer!

03:04.576 --> 03:08.002
Uh, I think I'm
as excited as I can get

03:08.003 --> 03:11.498
about setting up extra
seating for the summer rush.

03:11.533 --> 03:18.320
- But lars has big plans.
- You bet I do ... all those out-of-town

away from home without

03:20.675 --> 03:26.430
their boyfriends...
if you know what I mean.

03:26.514 --> 03:30.267
- Nope.
- Maybe I'll get a few numbers.

03:30.352 --> 03:33.387
- Maybe I'll even ... call one.
- Ha!

03:33.438 --> 03:36.390
Well, yeah, maybe
I'll meet a new friend.

03:36.594 --> 03:39.346
That's a great idea
... a special new friend to

03:39.481 --> 03:41.515
have fun on the beach
with in the summer.

03:41.599 --> 03:44.024
Maybe if I keep using the
mirror to guide me, I'll

03:44.025 --> 03:46.353
walk backwards Into my
own beach-summer-fun buddy!

03:46.438 --> 03:49.857
Next time you see me, I'll
be on the arm of a hot woman's.

It doesn't want to go with you.

07:40.838 --> 07:43.590

It can't want anything.

13:18.209 --> 13:21.011
What do you think, Garnet?

13:45.403 --> 13:47.704
I can't believe
Lapis would do this.

13:47.789 --> 13:51.074
- Gems shouldn't fight each other.
- We're always

13:51.125 --> 13:52.876
fighting gems, actually.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.829
- What?!
- Oh, how do I put this?

13:55.913 --> 13:59.728
All gems aren't necessarily ... good.

13:59.763 --> 14:02.252
All those monsters
we fight used to be just like us!

14:02.303 --> 14:03.837
- Right, Pearl?
- Yes.

14:03.921 --> 14:06.089
But they've become corrupted and broken.

14:06.224 --> 14:10.327
<i>We have to take care of them,
subdue them, contain them.</i>

14:10.411 --> 14:12.929
<i>It's the best we can
do for them for now.</i>

14:12.980 --> 14:15.682
<i>If we don't, then ...</i>

14:21.322 --> 14:24.658
That's some magical
destiny stuff, right there.

14:24.742 --> 14:28.920
Guys, I just had the best
idea for an album cover.

14:29.747 --> 14:32.849
This is it.
Lapis Lazuli is here.

14:32.884 --> 14:35.085
I don't understand.
What does she want

14:35.119 --> 14:38.288
- with the ocean?
- Whoa. Look at all this.

14:38.339 --> 14:40.757
It's ... it's just
like a giant aquarium.

14:40.842 --> 14:43.627
<i>You shouldn't be here!</i>

14:43.678 --> 14:49.172
- She sensed us.
- Lapis Lazuli, it's me, Steven!

14:51.636 --> 14:55.605
<i>- Go away before I make you.
- But we're</i>

14:55.640 --> 15:00.143
- beach-summer-fun buddies!
- N-o-o-o-o-o!

15:00.194 --> 15:02.696
<i>You're one of them ... </i>

15:02.780 --> 15:04.781
<i>one of the crystal gems.</i>

15:04.816 --> 15:07.117
- Easy.
- What do you mean?

15:07.185 --> 15:10.787
We're all gems, right?
Just let us help you.

15:10.855 --> 15:13.857
<i>You don't understand.
Just leave me alone.</i>

15:13.925 --> 15:15.933
We're not leaving, Lapis ...

15:15.934 --> 15:20.649
not until you give us
back our ocean!

15:21.165 --> 15:24.167
<i>I said, "leave me alone!" </i>

15:28.840 --> 15:31.174
Greg, kids, you stay behind us.

15:31.225 --> 15:34.644
- We'll handle this.
- Sounds good to me.

15:42.353 --> 15:44.821
- Ruh-oh.
- Stand together.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.857
Don't let them separate us.

15:46.941 --> 15:50.660
Garnet!

16:28.065 --> 16:30.650
Aw, come on!

16:32.737 --> 16:37.874
<i>Well, as long as we're playing fair ...</i>

16:49.921 --> 16:55.926
I hate fighting me.

16:55.977 --> 17:00.263
- Come on, lion!
- You can take me!

17:00.314 --> 17:03.233
- Oh, no, not the van!
- Revenge!

17:03.267 --> 17:07.103
Revenge!

17:12.242 --> 17:16.029
Kids!

17:20.617 --> 17:22.953
- Connie?
- Is this a normal magical

17:23.087 --> 17:25.088
mission for you?
'Cause I'm not so sure how

17:25.122 --> 17:27.589
comfortable I am with you
going on these anymo-o-o-re!

17:27.641 --> 17:30.088
Dad!

17:32.213 --> 17:34.965
Dad! Dad!
Are you okay?

17:35.099 --> 17:38.018
Oh, I think my leg's broken.

17:38.102 --> 17:43.189
See? This is why we
wear seatbelts, kids.

17:45.309 --> 17:49.529
Lapis, I don't
want to fight anymore.

17:49.614 --> 17:56.820
I said, "I don't want to fight"!

18:00.791 --> 18:02.993
Hmm? Mm.

18:08.666 --> 18:12.602
- Steven?
- Lapis, I'm coming up

18:12.670 --> 18:15.205
to see you.
So please don't drown me.

18:15.273 --> 18:20.176
Wait, Steven!

18:34.825 --> 18:40.997
- Lapis?
- What are you doing here, Steven?

18:41.098 --> 18:45.035
What? I ... no!
What are you doing here?

18:45.119 --> 18:50.040
This thing, the ocean,
this is crazy.

18:50.091 --> 18:53.209
Can't we work this out?
We gems should be friends.

18:53.294 --> 18:57.094
<i>- Whoa!
- Don't you know anything, Steven? </i>

18:57.129 --> 19:00.042
Your friends, they don't really
care about other gems.

19:00.043 --> 19:02.516
All they care about is the Earth.

19:02.517 --> 19:07.802
But I never believed in this place.

19:12.591 --> 19:14.781
What?

19:18.069 --> 19:22.989
- I just wanna go home.
- I know how important

19:23.074 --> 19:25.575
home can be.
But that's why I'm here.

19:25.659 --> 19:29.108
You took the ocean away,
and the ocean is an important

19:29.122 --> 19:31.331
- part of my home.
- I'm only using the ocean

19:31.415 --> 19:34.884
because my gem is cracked.
If I just stretch it

19:34.919 --> 19:37.587
far enough ...

19:37.638 --> 19:42.342
This is never going to work.

19:42.426 --> 19:45.534
I can fix your gem!
I have healing powers!

19:45.569 --> 19:48.139
Wait, you have healing powers?

19:48.174 --> 19:51.801
- I know, right?
- Oh, what should I ...

19:51.869 --> 19:56.172
Oh, uh, sorry.
This might be a little weird.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.993
What?

20:14.842 --> 20:20.630
- Thank you, Steven.
- No prob, bob.

20:20.698 --> 20:24.834
- It's Lapis.
- Yeah.

20:24.902 --> 20:31.141
- Okay. Bye.
- Oh!

20:39.283 --> 20:41.651
The whole
tower's coming down.

20:41.735 --> 20:46.873
What about Steven?

20:46.957 --> 20:51.744
- Whoa...!
- Grab my hand!

20:53.998 --> 20:55.865
Gotcha.

20:57.968 --> 21:01.199
Steven!

21:06.179 --> 21:07.573
Huh?

21:08.913 --> 21:13.850
Yes! Babe city,
here we come! Whoa!

21:21.025 --> 21:23.693
That's how you do it.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.785
Well, what's that
thing you always say about the

21:32.870 --> 21:36.623
- pork chops and the hot dogs?
- Look!

21:41.712 --> 21:46.850
Mm.

21:47.384 --> 21:51.883
- So, Lapis made it off planet.
- What does this mean for us?

21:51.918 --> 21:54.974
We wait and see.

21:55.059 --> 21:59.462
<i>See you, Lapis.
Wherever you are.</i>
