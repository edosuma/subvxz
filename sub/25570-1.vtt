00:43.878 --> 00:45.045
The invasion of the aliens...

00:45.087 --> 00:48.215
had disabled all the thermal weapons
on earth.

00:48.883 --> 00:52.553
Robot No. 1 and engineer Xu Ziying
traveled back...

00:52.595 --> 00:54.597
to the Qing Dynasty
when the martial arts flourished,

00:54.638 --> 00:55.931
and learn the Southern Boxing.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.100
With lots of twists and turns,

00:58.559 --> 01:00.519
Robot No. 1 sacrificed itself

01:00.561 --> 01:03.189
so the essence of the Southern Boxing
could be delivered back to us.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.317
The artificial intelligence robots began
to fight back against the aliens,

01:06.358 --> 01:09.278
and the earth is once again peaceful.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.620
We should send out a second robot.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.001
Since we're capable of defeating them,

01:24.043 --> 01:25.586
shall we continue with the plan?

01:25.628 --> 01:28.714
But time travel simply
consumes too much energy.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.385
Kung Fu Traveler 2
Northern Leg

04:20.511 --> 04:22.930
There are different classes
amongst alien mecha.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.559
The alien mecha of higher class
is obviously more powerful.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.520
Keep sending out the robots...

04:29.561 --> 04:31.772
to learn more comprehensive
martial art techniques...

04:32.523 --> 04:35.359
in order to deal with
the alien mecha of higher class.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.489
Robot No. 2 will be sent to
a pre-determined era

04:40.531 --> 04:43.283
to learn the more aggressive
Northern Leg techniques.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.620
Due to the fact that Robot
No. 1 was ambushed by the aliens,

04:47.246 --> 04:48.580
No.2 will be equipped with
more advanced...

04:48.622 --> 04:49.832
and powerful features.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.958
Yes.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.611
Have you completed loading the programs
and the mission commands?

05:20.154 --> 05:22.031
Yes, Director Tiger Chen.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.991
This mission is very dangerous.
Your predecessor...

05:24.283 --> 05:25.284
I will complete the mission.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.953
You're confident.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.079
Because I'm more powerful.

05:29.121 --> 05:33.417
Okay. Commander Xu Ziying
will be there waiting for you.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.128
Please deliever my message.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.422
The video has been turned on.
Go ahead.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.595
Take care of yourself!

06:23.050 --> 06:25.219
Destination time: September 21, 1898
Northern China 22:18

07:01.255 --> 07:07.928
Ah! Is it the immortal, or the devil?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.108
Where?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.110
Over there.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.904
Deleting...

07:27.197 --> 07:28.532
Over there.

07:28.907 --> 07:29.950
Over here! Over here!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.744
Come over here! Look!

07:32.786 --> 07:33.912
Is he dead?

07:33.954 --> 07:34.997
I don't think so.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.915
-Dead.
-He's dead?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.208
No, he's not.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.302
Is there anything wrong with him?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.720
There's nothing wrong with him
at the moment

07:50.137 --> 07:52.431
-He just passed out temporarily.
-Okay.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.415
Who am I?

09:17.099 --> 09:19.559
Who are you?

09:21.770 --> 09:25.107
What's your full name? Speak!

09:25.732 --> 09:27.484
Commander,
he was struck by the lightening...

09:27.526 --> 09:28.568
which could have injured his head.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.237
He might suffer from amnesia.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.405
Questioning him now...

09:36.743 --> 09:40.038
Where are you from?
Why are you here?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.542
To find someone.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.755
To find someone?
Who are you trying to find?

09:49.298 --> 09:52.259
The master of Northern Leg.
I want to learn the techniques from him.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.265
You're quite ambitious!
King of Northern Leg?

10:01.226 --> 10:03.520
He is the grand master of the leg style.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.231
He can kick away the flying bullets.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.193
That's total nonsense! How come I've
never heard of it? Huh?

10:12.279 --> 10:18.243
You're pretty lucky that you didn't die
from being struck by lightning.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.911
Consider yourself blessed
with good fortune

10:19.953 --> 10:23.623
How about this?
Stay and be a soldier here.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.627
I'll have to give you a name.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.675
Since this is the year of the Dog,

10:34.926 --> 10:38.347
from now on, your name is A'gou (doggy)

10:38.597 --> 10:40.098
-A'gou.
-Yes.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.642
A'gou, A'gou.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.989
Hey, A'gou...A'gou!

10:56.531 --> 10:57.824
Have you found the guy called Bei (North)?

10:57.866 --> 10:58.909
No.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.995
How about the one called Nan (South)?

11:02.496 --> 11:06.541
Nan? If I find Nan, I can find
the King of Northern Leg?

11:06.792 --> 11:07.876
Try it!

11:15.092 --> 11:17.302
Hey, A'gou! A'gou!

11:19.346 --> 11:20.680
A'gou! Wake up! A'gou!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.528
Battery Level

11:35.862 --> 11:37.364
The quartermaster said
you must be hungry.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.698
Hurry up and have your meal!

11:45.956 --> 11:47.040
Thank you!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.753
If you really want to thank me,
help me wash the clothes.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.027
Hey, A'gou, are you washing the clothes?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.238
Can you wash mine too?

12:18.697 --> 12:19.906
Put it down.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.743
Thanks, A'gou!

12:24.744 --> 12:27.205
Hey, A'gou!
drinks on me later!

12:38.758 --> 12:40.051
Thank you, A'gou!

12:40.093 --> 12:41.595
Thank you! Thank you!

13:12.876 --> 13:15.670
He has washed the clothes
from everyone in the camp.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.881
Is he stupid or something?

13:20.258 --> 13:21.676
I don't think so.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.263
This guy spent the whole night
washing clothes.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.601
As a result, everyone in the
camp will accept him as one of their own.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.815
The more flawless he seems,

13:38.235 --> 13:40.195
the less I can trust him.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.325
So, watch him closely.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.712
Since you're so reluctant to trust
him, why did you take him in?

13:59.756 --> 14:02.092
If he is indeed sent by someone,

14:02.133 --> 14:05.971
keeping him close
will help me find the flaws easily.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.620
The King of Northern Leg does exist!

14:32.080 --> 14:34.207
Why don't you believe it?

14:34.249 --> 14:39.588
Once, he was surrounded by more than a
dozen of guns at a dead end.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.259
He lifted up his leg...
bang...bang...bang!

14:44.926 --> 14:47.429
He kicked away
all the bullets flying toward him.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.146
Commander is suspicious of him,

14:56.187 --> 14:57.856
and wants to keep him
under close surveillance.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.190
We can't approach him,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.192
and he doesn't recognize you.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.652
This appears to be an issue with the
intelligence part of the program.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.571
There must be something wrong
with the computer.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.367
He does remember...

15:09.409 --> 15:11.578
that his mission is to find and learn from
the King of Northern Leg.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.250
Find a street-performer and see if
it'll refresh his memory.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.293
Yes.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.889
(King of Northern Leg)
Come on! Ladies and gentlemen!

15:31.931 --> 15:34.017
I have studied the martial arts
since my childhood...

15:34.059 --> 15:36.269
and gained some good leg skills.

15:37.270 --> 15:42.067
I will show off my skills in front of
all of you today.

15:42.734 --> 15:46.446
Nice!

15:52.535 --> 15:53.578
Malfunction. Unable to save.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.628
Malfunction. Unable to save.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.714
Malfunction. Unable to save.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.552
Thank you.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.933
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're all ordinary people.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.061
It's unavoidable to get hurt.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.606
We must have good medicines with us
at all times.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.525
How about some heat-activating ointment?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.786
Hey, why did you stop?

16:39.207 --> 16:43.878
You with the peculiar hairstyle
seem gifted.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.008
Are you here to challenge me?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.553
I... I didn't come to fight you.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.807
I want to learn your leg skills.
Come on! Show me more moves!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.268
Are you making fun of me?

16:58.643 --> 16:59.769
I'm not.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.896
Come on, show us!

17:06.276 --> 17:07.569
Ok, let's do it.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.031
Don't disappoint us.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.410
If I lose, I will leave.

17:15.702 --> 17:20.205
If you lose, we can still be friends.

17:22.876 --> 17:23.877
Stop!

17:28.715 --> 17:32.010
A'gou, how dare you!

17:32.051 --> 17:35.472
How dare you pick a fight
with a civilian? You...

17:38.808 --> 17:39.809
Somebody...

17:40.894 --> 17:43.396
escort him back to be disciplined
according to the military law.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.783
Commander, I was wrong.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.078
I'm glad you realized you were wrong.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.584
He is not the King of Northern Leg.
I made a mistake.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.088
You...you're really good for nothing.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.885
You want to learn the martial arts?

18:13.927 --> 18:16.054
Why do you insist on learning from the...

18:16.095 --> 18:17.388
King of Northern Leg?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.433
Can't you just find someone else?

18:22.018 --> 18:24.646
There're so many styles of kung fu
in the world.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.607
All of them are established by people.

18:28.566 --> 18:33.112
A'gou, you need to learn to
create your own style.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.031
-My own style?
-Yeah!

18:35.281 --> 18:36.574
-Me?
-Yes!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.117
-Make my own?
-What's wrong with that?

18:38.576 --> 18:42.038
Are you not as good as the others?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.542
Achievements are not just
for the privileged.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.836
You can do it if you work hard.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.089
A'gou, nobody is born
to be better than the others.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.509
Your only weakness is
your lack of confidence.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.680
When I was 18 years old,

18:58.721 --> 18:59.848
I left home to be a soldier.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.475
At that time,
I had never even worn socks...

19:02.892 --> 19:06.980
let alone firing a weapon or
eating western-style food.

19:07.605 --> 19:12.652
Look at me now. I have 5,000 soldiers
following me,

19:12.694 --> 19:17.490
5,000 guns, 100 horses,
and ten cannons.

19:17.532 --> 19:21.411
I accomplished all of these
with my own hands.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.540
I still don't want to create my own style.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.833
I just want to find
the King of Northern Leg.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.336
But you can't just wait here.

19:31.963 --> 19:35.633
Do you know the concept of maintaining a
job while looking for a better one?

19:36.301 --> 19:37.385
Maintaining a job
while looking for a better one?

19:37.427 --> 19:39.304
Yes. How about this...

19:39.345 --> 19:43.349
From now on, learn from Cuckoo first.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.310
No way!

19:46.185 --> 19:49.147
Why? Her leg skills aren't bad.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.317
You'll benefit a lot from her.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.068
I don't want to learn from her.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.362
I don't fight women and
I don't want to break my own rules.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.198
Him?

20:03.077 --> 20:06.289
A'gou, you need to realize when there's
something good in front of you.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.625
You're in no position to be picky

20:10.627 --> 20:13.046
Fine, go find Instructor Xu.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.381
Let her find you a master.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.552
Commander, release me first.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.196
I have sent someone to check on
that street performer,

20:38.237 --> 20:41.282
but he was killed. I suspect...

20:41.741 --> 20:43.409
It was Cuckoo who killed him.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.287
Commander...

20:47.747 --> 20:51.250
Regardless if he has anything to do
with A'gou,

20:51.751 --> 20:54.087
we can't take any chances.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.924
What if he's not what you think he is?

20:58.591 --> 21:02.929
If A'gou is just an idiot who has a clean
background, that's even better!

21:05.515 --> 21:09.102
If he's just an idiot,
why do you want to cultivate him?

21:10.603 --> 21:14.941
If an idiot can turn into a master
under my cultivation,

21:15.733 --> 21:18.903
wouldn't that benefit me as well?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.738
Then this troop of strong soldiers...

21:20.780 --> 21:24.575
will be even more willing to make it big
with me in the future.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.628
I'm from the school of
Chuojiao (Kicking Feet).

21:35.670 --> 21:37.422
Chen practices Tantui (Bouncing Leg).

21:37.797 --> 21:40.591
These are the most famous styles
in the North.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.388
He doesn't even know how to properly
greet the masters?

21:46.222 --> 21:49.559
A'gou, you should put your fists
together and bow to us.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.354
Masters, please accept
my sincere greetings.

21:55.189 --> 21:58.901
Tantui is divided into Linqing Tantui,
Shaolin Tantui and Jiaomen Tantui.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.279
I practice the Linqing Tantui.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.530
There is a saying that goes like...

22:02.572 --> 22:03.948
those who practice boxing
without any leg skills,

22:03.990 --> 22:05.158
will always be clumsy.

22:05.700 --> 22:09.203
There is another saying that says
the leg is the key to defeat.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.081
Another one also says...

22:12.123 --> 22:15.084
Tantui are like having four hands,
it's feared by human and spirits.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.128
How about that? Awesome, right?

22:17.587 --> 22:18.629
I don't know.

22:19.630 --> 22:20.882
You don't know?

22:20.923 --> 22:23.885
How would I know if you're awesome
without seeing it?

22:24.385 --> 22:27.221
Zhiguo, why don't you show A'gou
a few moves?

22:29.307 --> 22:30.308
No problem!

22:32.393 --> 22:33.895
The characteristic of Tantui is...

22:33.936 --> 22:35.646
when you lift your leg, it won't be higher
than the knee.

22:48.743 --> 22:49.827
There is an old saying that...

22:49.869 --> 22:52.330
Chuojiao will follow after the hips turn.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.208
Zhang, your Chuojiao is quite powerful.

22:56.918 --> 23:00.046
Zhiguo, Commander
has found us a good student.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.843
Don't gloat yet.
Have you got it all? Show us.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.386
A'gou, come on.

23:21.567 --> 23:26.906
I realized something this morning. He
learns fast but forgets it even faster.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.533
Really?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.418
After the class of Theories of War
at 10:10,

23:39.460 --> 23:41.379
he went to Chen Zhiguo to learn Tantui.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.757
He was taught two moves
in an hour and ten minutes.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.717
In the beginning,
he learned fast and proficiently.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.678
But he forgot them all at the end.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.930
Chen Zhiguo was very angry
and yelled at him for ten minutes.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.057
He had lunch at 12 o'clock.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.310
At 12:30, he went to Zhang Qi
to learn Chuojiao

23:56.352 --> 23:59.272
He spent two hours learning but could not
remember any of it at the end.

24:03.568 --> 24:06.445
His computer system
must be fixed manually.

24:07.363 --> 24:10.741
But if he can't recognize you,
will he accept the manual repair?

24:12.618 --> 24:14.203
It'll be difficult to do it here.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.122
We must figure out a way
to take him to the base.

24:16.581 --> 24:17.623
Yes.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.010
Oh man...I'm not sick.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.304
I am really not sick.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.597
Man...

24:33.806 --> 24:36.517
-There's nothing wrong with me.
-Come on.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.269
I'm really not sick.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.520
It's just a checkup.

24:41.189 --> 24:44.442
Doctor, I think
there is something wrong with his brain.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.027
He learns really fast,

24:46.694 --> 24:50.114
but he forgets even faster
and remembers nothing at all.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.075
That's right, doc.
please check him thoroughly.

24:57.205 --> 25:01.250
From the look of your hairstyle,
you might be suffering from...

25:01.292 --> 25:02.835
hyperactivity of yang fire due to
yin deficiency.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.256
Doctor, I'm not sick.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.842
You don't even have a pulse,
how can you say you're okay?

25:10.885 --> 25:12.178
Activating biomimetic mode...

25:15.556 --> 25:17.850
He went to the traditional Chinese medical
center in Jin'an district.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.812
Is everything ready to go at the base?

25:21.854 --> 25:22.897
Yes.

25:34.700 --> 25:39.038
Your pulse seems to be stabilized now.
Here, I'll write you a prescription.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.545
Get your herbal medicine according to
this prescription.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.095
Cupping

25:55.054 --> 25:58.057
What kind of kung fu is this?
I want to try it, too.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.729
Are you going out?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.691
I'm going to check on the store.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.902
How many times have I told you?

26:10.569 --> 26:13.531
That store's not going to
make much money for you.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.866
There's no need for you to work so hard.

26:15.908 --> 26:20.621
If you were with me, you wouldn't need to
worry about anything ever again.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.086
Commander, is there anything I can help
you with?

26:28.087 --> 26:31.966
Look...It's about...

26:32.258 --> 26:35.720
I want to invite the people from
the German Embassy to lunch.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.847
I would like you to be my interpreter.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.058
I will arrange someone to go with you.

26:41.517 --> 26:46.272
No...you know these foreigners
are cunning as a fox.

26:46.856 --> 26:50.943
I feel reassured only
when you're by my side.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.698
I need to go to the store today as...

26:55.740 --> 26:57.700
I have something to deal with there.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.542
Fine, just forget what I have said.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.888
Zhiguo, we have never gone this way before

27:18.929 --> 27:20.514
Can we make it through?

27:20.556 --> 27:23.059
-Don't worry, I have a plan.
-Okay.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.030
Gu Feng Antique

27:51.504 --> 27:52.505
Gentlemen...

27:55.257 --> 27:56.509
please follow me.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.596
Let's go.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.060
Gentlemen, please take a look...

28:06.102 --> 28:08.270
at the blue and white pottery of
Ming Dynasty.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.614
Instructor! Why are you here?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.033
This is my store.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.619
Oh I see.

28:27.289 --> 28:29.166
Come over here.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.709
Okay.

28:34.547 --> 28:38.884
Do you feel that you've seen me before?
That there's something familiar about me?

28:39.885 --> 28:41.595
Do you know why?

28:43.764 --> 28:45.558
Because you're my instructor.

28:48.269 --> 28:50.354
Because we have a certain connection.

28:52.356 --> 28:56.193
You're not human.
You're a robot from the future.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.613
And I am your guide.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.411
What are you talking about?
I don't understand at all.

29:20.676 --> 29:21.760
It doesn't hurt, does it?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.390
A big wound like this but yet it's not
bleeding?

29:27.016 --> 29:28.934
Do you think you're just gifted?

29:29.727 --> 29:32.605
How many gifted people
are made out of metal?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.614
I have waited for you for 17 years.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.746
Instructor. Are you messing with me?

29:51.957 --> 29:56.921
I know I lost my memory, but you
shouldn't mess with me like that.

29:57.588 --> 30:00.299
My body is strong like the steel.

30:00.716 --> 30:03.260
I have the invincible armor to block
all swords and spears.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.055
Listen to me, you're a robot!

30:09.975 --> 30:12.645
I know machines, I've seen them
at the Commander's house.

30:14.063 --> 30:18.067
There are machines that make bullets, and
machines that build cannons.

30:18.108 --> 30:21.862
If a machine can become a person,
it should be called a "Machine Goblin".

30:23.030 --> 30:24.782
I can fix you.

30:25.658 --> 30:29.453
I can make you remember
everything you have ever learned.

30:39.129 --> 30:40.422
Put it on.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.593
-What are you doing?
-I'm fixing you.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.222
Fine.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.956
Hey, how did you put me inside there?

31:14.540 --> 31:15.583
Matching...

31:15.624 --> 31:18.419
Have you completed loading the programs
and the mission commands?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.045
Percentage Matched

31:20.921 --> 31:23.591
This mission is very dangerous.
Your predecessor...

31:30.764 --> 31:31.932
Take care of yourself!

31:34.727 --> 31:35.728
I remember it now.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.399
You must be my family member
from the previous life.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.779
No wonder your image is always in my mind.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.615
It must be our destiny.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.909
This is me from the previous life,
right?

31:51.410 --> 31:54.204
What's up with his outfit?

31:56.915 --> 32:00.044
I guess we can live with your current
comprehension of the situation

32:00.085 --> 32:03.047
What are you waiting for then?
Heal me.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.798
Cure me.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.077
Both of you were drunk.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.579
-We drank?
-Yes.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.705
Why?

32:36.747 --> 32:39.375
I don't know why.
You two wanted me to drink with you.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.417
Then both of you got drunk...

32:40.459 --> 32:43.003
and I had to hire a carriage
to take us back.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.818
Teach me Chuojiao.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.653
You still want to learn it?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.447
-Man...
-Hurry up and teach me!

33:11.323 --> 33:13.200
-Fine, watch carefully then.
-Okay.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.592
I remember it now.
Really. I do!

33:31.135 --> 33:32.928
Can you really remember?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.526
He's doing it.

33:57.786 --> 33:58.954
Take care of yourself!

34:01.874 --> 34:03.250
Take care of yourself!

34:08.130 --> 34:12.217
I thought...
I have forgotten what you look like.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.556
The moment I saw Robot No.2,

34:18.556 --> 34:19.558
I realized...

34:24.438 --> 34:28.525
you have always been in my heart.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.442
There are two reasons why I stayed with
the Commander for 17 years.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.196
First, I know you will travel back
to this point in time.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.950
Second, I'll need to rely on the
Commander...

35:18.283 --> 35:19.451
to find the King of Northern Leg.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.579
According to the historical records,

35:22.621 --> 35:25.165
Commander wrote a book...

35:25.207 --> 35:27.459
and that's the first time the
King of Northern Leg was mentioned.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.337
I have asked him about it several times,

35:30.921 --> 35:33.423
but he didn't seem to be familiar
with him.

35:38.929 --> 35:42.808
Maybe this King of Northern Leg
won't appear for a few more years?

35:45.936 --> 35:46.979
Instructor, you're so awesome!

35:47.020 --> 35:49.439
If that's the case, your battery will...

35:50.274 --> 35:52.442
And the ongoing war in the future will...

35:54.027 --> 35:55.112
Instructor!

35:57.739 --> 36:00.701
Instructor, you're talking nonsense again.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.996
I don't understand any of those nonsense.

36:05.664 --> 36:09.126
You need to be treated again. Let's go.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.754
Instructor...I'm here to pay
for my treatments.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.133
It's not enough?

36:16.550 --> 36:19.219
It didn't cost me this much when I went
to the traditional Chinese doctor...

36:19.261 --> 36:20.429
who gave me a big pack of medicine.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.513
Instructor...

36:22.890 --> 36:25.392
-Come with me!
-Instructor...

36:26.226 --> 36:28.186
I'm fine now. I'm healed.

36:28.228 --> 36:31.398
I'm totally fine. Goodbye, Instructor.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.733
Wait!

36:33.942 --> 36:35.152
Wait a minute!

36:35.193 --> 36:39.740
Instructor! I'm a human and not a robot.
I'm the same as everybody else.

36:39.781 --> 36:43.660
If I were a robot, how could I eat, drink,
pee and poo?

36:43.702 --> 36:46.330
That's the biomimetic features
in your program.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.664
The way you learn martial arts
is different from that of others.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.708
You're using a 30-megapixel camera

36:49.750 --> 36:50.834
to capture the images...

36:50.876 --> 36:52.252
which are then analyzed and stored...

36:52.294 --> 36:54.504
with the quad-core processor.

36:54.546 --> 36:58.258
Theoretically, you're able to learn
what see instantaneously...

36:58.300 --> 37:00.052
and use what you've just learned.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.721
It's like having many small minions
working overtime in your brain.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.681
Right. What's wrong with that?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.850
-That's how everyone is.
-Human's memory...

37:06.892 --> 37:07.935
Wait a minute.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.896
Can you slice the brain in half
and show me?

37:10.938 --> 37:12.481
Maybe we both have small minions...

37:12.522 --> 37:14.900
working overtime in our brains.
See you, Instructor!

37:19.237 --> 37:21.823
Should we just tie a rope around him
and force him back here?

37:21.865 --> 37:25.077
No. The programs in his system are
somewhat messed up.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.412
Don't over-stimulate him.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.927
Commander.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.262
Looking for the Kind of Northern Leg?

37:44.721 --> 37:46.056
Yes.

37:46.098 --> 37:50.102
We need your help to find him.

37:50.435 --> 37:51.520
But...

37:51.561 --> 37:53.021
It's you who asked me to teach him
kung fu.

37:53.397 --> 37:55.857
Although he has learned the leg skills of
the two different branches,

37:56.274 --> 37:58.443
he has not been able to master it fully.

37:59.861 --> 38:03.281
That's easy. There's no need to find that
King of Northern Leg.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.451
It's just a bottleneck in his training.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.454
Let him go and challenge others.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.248
Challenge?

38:11.289 --> 38:15.127
Yeah. It'll improve his skills while he
practices how to survive.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.795
When I was young,

38:16.837 --> 38:21.466
I challenged dozens of martial
arts schools in the country.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.427
That's how I achieved
everything I have today.

38:25.429 --> 38:29.224
It's decided then. I will take him myself.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.811
Let's find the schools known
for the leg skills.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.981
We'll be able to get the secret scroll of
each martial art branch,

38:36.023 --> 38:38.525
and combine their best as our own.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.758
Good job!

40:24.381 --> 40:25.423
Excellent!

40:31.429 --> 40:32.556
Let's go, A'gou!

40:42.440 --> 40:44.276
Welcome back, Commander.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.374
Take a seat.

41:04.880 --> 41:09.134
Brothers, thank you for your hard work
in the past few days.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.512
Today, let's have a feast.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.389
Come on.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.099
Okay.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.570
Commander, should we ask him to come over?

41:32.157 --> 41:35.160
No, just let him read.

41:36.328 --> 41:39.289
I wasn't wrong about him.

41:39.331 --> 41:42.083
He challenged eight schools in seven days.

41:44.169 --> 41:47.339
What we've acquired is worth 10 years
of work from him.

41:47.923 --> 41:50.800
Martial art training is about virtue.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.803
You teaching him like this...

41:57.224 --> 42:01.519
Go to the kitchen and ask them to cook
more dishes for all of us.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.188
Go ahead.

42:06.691 --> 42:07.734
Come on.

42:11.905 --> 42:17.035
You two, help serve our brothers.
Enjoy!

42:27.045 --> 42:28.755
All these years,

42:28.797 --> 42:31.258
don't you have the ambition
to conquer the world?

42:32.717 --> 42:34.219
I'm talking about A'gou.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.722
It's the same thing.

42:38.723 --> 42:41.768
Why do people want to learn
the martial arts?

42:44.229 --> 42:46.356
It's to be the number one in the world.

42:46.940 --> 42:51.069
When he gains power via learning
the martial arts,

42:51.903 --> 42:54.739
he will desire more.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.619
For me, my desire is to be the top.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.039
I need your help.

43:04.457 --> 43:05.750
I'm not interested.

43:07.294 --> 43:09.587
You won't even do it for me?

43:10.797 --> 43:16.094
Our deal was for me to help you
seven years.

43:17.012 --> 43:19.597
And this year is the last year.

43:21.266 --> 43:26.604
You're forcing me
to make a move early.

43:45.457 --> 43:49.961
It has been seven years.
Don't you know my heart at all?

43:52.922 --> 43:54.007
What do you mean?

43:56.176 --> 43:58.219
What were you doing?
You didn't come back for dinner...

43:58.636 --> 43:59.763
and kept Commander waiting.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.931
-Go sit down.
-Yes.

44:03.099 --> 44:07.270
A'gou, here, sit by my side.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.777
Let me ask you...did you learn anything?

44:13.818 --> 44:14.903
Yes.

44:14.944 --> 44:18.948
Great. I will take you to another one
tomorrow.

44:20.283 --> 44:24.162
But it's not a martial arts school,
but a security agency.

44:24.204 --> 44:25.372
Security agency?

44:25.413 --> 44:29.667
The top master of the agency has a scroll
of Leg skills from Shaolin Temple.

44:30.752 --> 44:35.006
With it, your leg skills will definitely
improve to a whole new level.

44:43.306 --> 44:47.685
Shun Yuan Security Agency

44:59.364 --> 45:00.657
Commander Yuan,

45:00.698 --> 45:03.118
the judicial commissioner of
Qing Dynasty is here to see Mr. Tan.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.888
The top master's last name is Wang, right?

45:23.930 --> 45:25.306
Who is Mr. Tan?

45:26.349 --> 45:28.977
Mr. Tan lives in this agency.

45:29.018 --> 45:30.019
Oh.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.689
So are we here to challenge them?

45:32.730 --> 45:35.859
Of course.
We're definitely here to challenge them.

45:36.359 --> 45:39.070
It's not just a routine challenge, do your
best and have no mercy.

45:40.113 --> 45:43.366
A'gou, don't make me regret
all of the work we put in on you.

45:43.408 --> 45:44.784
Don't worry, Commander.

45:50.790 --> 45:53.585
Excuse our poor hospitality.
Please forgive me.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.257
Mr. Tan, how have you been?

46:01.092 --> 46:03.887
This top master looks so average.

46:04.512 --> 46:07.056
I hear Commander has challenged
a lot of martial arts schools.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.559
I was wondering how the commander got the
leisure time to challenge the schools...

46:09.601 --> 46:10.852
when you're already busy in dealing with
the military affairs.

46:12.061 --> 46:14.606
I guess Commander just want to see me?

46:16.858 --> 46:21.696
Mr. Tan is indeed outspoken and witty.

46:23.072 --> 46:26.910
Exactly. I came just for you today.

46:27.118 --> 46:30.955
You could have sent an invitation.
I would've happily accepted it.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.876
I have to avoid being noticed.

46:34.918 --> 46:37.587
A relationship between an officer in the
imperial court and a military town...

46:38.046 --> 46:41.341
is strictly forbidden, not to mention a
crucial member like Mr. Tan.

46:42.842 --> 46:44.093
Oh, that's an overstatement.

46:44.844 --> 46:48.598
Mr. Tan,
I would like us to be sworn brothers.

46:49.224 --> 46:52.727
You're in the imperial court while
I'm in control of the army.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.897
Thank you for your
kindness, Commander.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.942
Unfortunately, I have no such plan.

46:59.776 --> 47:02.737
I know. It's not because Mr. Tan
thinks any less of me,

47:02.779 --> 47:04.948
but rather it's to avoid the rumors.

47:06.199 --> 47:08.910
Fine, how about...

47:09.661 --> 47:11.120
Let's bet on it.

47:13.289 --> 47:14.374
Bet?

47:15.542 --> 47:19.963
I hear that Master Wang...

47:20.004 --> 47:22.215
is the top monk from the Shaolin Temple.

47:23.258 --> 47:25.301
It just happens that
I have a young soldier...

47:25.343 --> 47:27.971
in my camp who doesn't know
his own place and wants to...

47:28.012 --> 47:30.014
come and learn from him.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.892
If he wins, let's be sworn brothers.

47:32.934 --> 47:34.686
What can people say about that? Right?

47:36.187 --> 47:37.981
How can such an important matter be
decided based on a bet?

47:39.607 --> 47:43.361
A small bet is just for fun.
Mr. Tan, you have to raise the stake.

47:45.530 --> 47:49.867
Director Wang has a scroll of
Leg skills from Shaolin Temple

47:50.368 --> 47:51.452
Why don't we put that in
our little bet as well?

47:55.290 --> 47:58.209
No. I will not agree to this.

47:59.252 --> 48:04.424
I'm not going to return
empty handed today.

48:18.229 --> 48:21.399
Is Mr. Tan really not from our
Tantui School?

48:21.774 --> 48:24.819
Lower your voice.
Mr. Tan is the backbone of the country,

48:24.861 --> 48:26.904
and very much valued by the emperor.

48:28.114 --> 48:29.574
Then he definitely doesn't know Tantui.

48:34.203 --> 48:37.123
I would like to see this young man myself.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.919
Mr. Tan, please allow me to accept this
challenge.

49:07.111 --> 49:10.865
You came to challenge us,
so according to the rules...

49:10.907 --> 49:13.076
I get to choose the weapon.

49:16.371 --> 49:20.458
This is the Five Tigers Chopping Sword
that made me famous.

49:20.750 --> 49:25.463
It's 3 feet and 7 inches long,
and weights 8 jins and 4 liangs.

49:30.426 --> 49:31.469
Please.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.491
Shaolin Tantui

50:29.193 --> 50:30.194
Danger

50:39.454 --> 50:40.705
Why is Instructor Xu here?

50:53.551 --> 50:54.552
Kill him.

50:59.390 --> 51:00.391
Kill him.

51:01.726 --> 51:02.935
Okay.

51:22.538 --> 51:23.706
Warning

51:23.748 --> 51:25.374
Do Not Violate the
Three Rules for Robots

51:27.293 --> 51:28.294
Good.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.307
Bro...

52:24.058 --> 52:25.935
Bro...

52:28.521 --> 52:33.901
Mr. Tan, two of your men
are fighting my guy.

52:34.944 --> 52:37.989
Isn't that against the rules?

52:38.614 --> 52:41.576
Bro! Bro!

52:52.753 --> 52:53.796
Come over here.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.551
I will take A'gou to see a doctor.

53:06.976 --> 53:10.521
Mr. Tan, a bet is a bet. Admit defeat.

53:12.064 --> 53:14.859
What else do you have to say?

53:47.683 --> 53:52.730
I was possessed by an alien just now.
He was going to kill you through me.

53:54.065 --> 53:55.149
What?

53:55.191 --> 53:57.902
Robots are programed to never hurt
a human.

53:58.361 --> 53:59.570
It's one of the Three Rules
for Robots.

54:00.446 --> 54:03.240
If a robot violates the rules,
it will self-destruct.

54:04.951 --> 54:06.786
So it turns out I'm really not a human.

54:09.246 --> 54:12.041
It's a relief that the malfunction
wasn't serious

54:12.416 --> 54:15.252
It's not all bad news since
you got your memory back.

54:18.381 --> 54:23.552
However, the aliens found me which means
they'll definitely come back for you.

54:24.053 --> 54:25.179
I'm not afraid.

54:35.106 --> 54:39.568
If it can possess me, it can possess
anybody around you.

54:41.112 --> 54:44.949
I don't have much time left.
I will get weaker and weaker.

54:46.075 --> 54:49.078
So I must learn the Northern Leg as
soon as possible and complete the mission.

54:50.746 --> 54:53.958
But I still haven't found the
King of Northern Leg.

54:54.625 --> 55:00.047
I have learned the Chuojiao, Tantui, and
the secret scrolls from various schools.

55:00.673 --> 55:03.509
As soon as I have thoroughly
mastered them, I can create my own style.

55:41.839 --> 55:42.965
Northern Leg

55:44.467 --> 55:46.218
According to the imperial decree,

55:46.927 --> 55:50.389
our troop will be in charge of the defense
affairs such as patrolling the streets,

55:50.431 --> 55:53.434
and civilian security and protection.

55:55.561 --> 55:59.398
All of you were cultivated by me.

55:59.440 --> 56:02.401
We are all brothers risking our lives for
each other.

56:02.443 --> 56:06.072
From now on, I hope you can
show me the morale and...

56:06.363 --> 56:08.699
the spirit of a new army.

56:08.741 --> 56:10.910
Are you confident?

56:11.368 --> 56:16.207
Hail Commander!

56:16.624 --> 56:17.917
Great.

56:22.213 --> 56:23.255
Let him through.

56:32.890 --> 56:37.561
A'gou, how dare you come back?

56:38.521 --> 56:41.607
You think the military law is a joke?

56:42.733 --> 56:43.984
Commander,

56:44.026 --> 56:46.695
I couldn't move from my injuries...

56:46.737 --> 56:49.115
and have taken some time to recover.

56:50.241 --> 56:53.369
I think you were hiding so you can
practice your martial arts.

56:53.744 --> 56:56.622
How do you feel now after such a long
practice?

56:57.248 --> 56:59.375
Can you use your legs to kick away
the bullets?

56:59.416 --> 57:00.751
I...

57:02.753 --> 57:05.798
Useless! I'm telling you,

57:06.340 --> 57:09.510
with a sufficient distance and
fast leg skills,

57:09.552 --> 57:11.512
you'll be able to kick away
the bullets with your legs.

57:13.097 --> 57:17.935
You have practiced for so long.
Don't you want to try it out?

57:19.728 --> 57:22.356
Commander,
I'm willing to give it a try.

57:23.774 --> 57:27.278
Brilliant! I'll see you on the field.

58:19.288 --> 58:20.748
This move...

58:20.789 --> 58:23.334
is Chuojiao's
"Eight Immortals Birthday Feast".

58:26.712 --> 58:28.130
That's perfect.

58:28.505 --> 58:33.969
I don't want my soldiers
to blindly follow the so-called authority.

58:34.011 --> 58:38.390
I want you to be the authority,
your own authority.

58:38.974 --> 58:41.310
-Hail Commander!
-Hail Commander!

58:57.201 --> 58:58.369
Instructor Xu.

59:00.871 --> 59:01.956
How can I help you?

59:03.207 --> 59:06.585
We had a deal. I'll leave...

59:06.919 --> 59:08.212
if you start a war.

59:08.796 --> 59:10.673
I've helped you train the new soldiers...

59:10.714 --> 59:12.466
but I won't help a tyrant to victimize
his subjects.

59:14.426 --> 59:16.971
Instructor Xu, you don't understand.

59:17.721 --> 59:21.558
Mr. Tan and I are friends now.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.729
He's formed an alliance with you?

59:38.242 --> 59:40.369
As long as he's not against me,

59:40.411 --> 59:42.997
the country will be mine
sooner or later.

59:43.038 --> 59:45.249
He is loyal to the imperial court.

59:46.041 --> 59:48.627
A hero's born when the sword's pulled;

59:49.128 --> 59:52.047
but the suffering of the commoners lasts
for decades.

59:53.757 --> 59:57.094
I've dealt with him for so long for
the sake of the commoners

59:57.511 --> 59:59.930
If he still can't appreciate my kindness,

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.934
then I'll have to...kill him.

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.232
You are still going to start a war.

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:15.612
Birds of different feathers
don't flock together

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:19.450
Did I say you can go?

01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:25.289
You're trying to have her make me stay?

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:28.751
Don't make me do this.

01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:30.627
Ziying,

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:36.133
I really don't want to lose our
seven years of friendship.

01:00:39.094 --> 01:00:40.763
You're on your own. Good luck.

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:53.942
Kung fu.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.111
Were you surprised?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.530
Small things like this
is not worth my time.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.616
What I want are sizable troops of
soldiers, horses...

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.160
and the whole country.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.545
I'll give you two days...

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:17.591
to deal with that ragged store.

01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:19.802
Bring A'gou back, too.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.389
Whether it's our seven years
of relationship,

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.099
or my cultivation for A'gou,

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.644
both of you should pay me back.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:35.067
You promised me
you wouldn't start a war.

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:38.946
I regret it now.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.097
I will teach him a lesson.

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:08.100
He is quite smart.
You might not be a match for him.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.061
It's my fault.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.441
Coming from the future,
I have underestimated this era.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:20.237
It seems that...
if he was born in our time,

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.281
he would have been a fierce hero too.

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:25.909
Him? Is he more brilliant than
Director Tiger Chen?

01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:32.749
These two are completely different people.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:37.087
Regardless what era he's in,

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:39.756
Commander can't stand to be alone.

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.927
Whatever it is, there's something off
about him.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:49.391
He looks at you as if you belong to him

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:56.356
I have devoted seven years of my life to
help him, after all.

01:02:57.608 --> 01:03:00.569
I also have hundreds of years of
experience ahead of this era.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.864
I had a deal with him.

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:06.408
He can't start a war,

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:10.412
hurt the innocent,
or dominate the country.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:12.789
He wants to dominate the country?

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.335
It has already started.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:20.547
He's been building up his personal
influences, training the new soldiers,

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:23.008
controlling the local districts,

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:26.386
and forming alliances with different
ministers of the imperial court.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.224
Why did Mr. Tan form an alliance
with the Commander?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.728
Was it really because he lost the
martial arts challenge?

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.524
Of course not!

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.568
He knows the Commander's ambitions.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.696
He did it to keep the Commander at bay...

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.740
to buy more time for the imperial court.

01:03:47.366 --> 01:03:50.827
According to the history,
Commander will...

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:54.248
kill him and start a rebellion
in a few days.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.292
This war will last for decades.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:00.337
What can we do?

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.173
Kill him?

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:06.843
The problem is...

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.929
I can't kill those who had
been mentioned in any recorded history.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:13.809
If we change the history,
the consequence will be devastating.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:19.481
That is the number one rule
for time travelers.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.699
Take off your shoes.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.835
Actually, I don't need to wear shoes.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.545
Stop talking.

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:48.135
You are missing Director Chen
as you sew my shoes?

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.141
Ah...I'm right. Shall we talk about it?

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.269
What's the point of chatting with a robot?

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.939
I know about what happened with
Robot No.1

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.900
You practiced Southern Boxing...

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:07.696
when something's bothering you.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.032
Am I right?

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:15.078
When did you become a fortune-teller?

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:19.541
Then tell me, when will I marry?

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.256
It's not likely in this lifetime.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:28.508
Why?

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:33.263
Because you are still in love with
Director Chen from the future.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.059
When you talk about Director Chen,
your temperature rises by two degree,

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.769
and your voice pitch dropped.

01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:45.233
Go and pack up. We'll head out
to find the King of Northern Leg.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.238
No. I want to see the history that
you mentioned.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.366
-Why?
-Because I'm curious.

01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:07.798
Are all of these true?

01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:10.634
Yes.

01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:15.597
Commander deserves to die.
I'm going to kill him.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:20.894
Maybe the future would be better
if the history was changed?

01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:22.979
Without the decades-long war,

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:25.357
maybe the country
would be in a better shape.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:29.027
Then when the aliens invade us in the
future, we wouldn't fail.

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:32.322
It's possible.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:36.660
However, countless lives may disappear,

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.996
including you and me.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:42.874
Are you afraid?

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.588
I wouldn't be here if I'm afraid of dying.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:54.970
I have another idea. Why don't I try to
persuade the Commander...

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.055
not to kill Mr. Tan.

01:06:58.098 --> 01:06:59.266
You?

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:00.767
Yes, me.

01:07:05.564 --> 01:07:07.399
They're inside...

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:12.362
It doesn't look like he'll give us
a chance to do so.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:37.763
Let's go.

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:49.107
There's no one on the left,
keep going that way.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.234
I'll stall them.

01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.029
Let's go together.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.406
Go now or
we won't be able to leave at all.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:08.084
A'gou. I won't spoil you anymore. Fire!

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:55.841
Cannoneer, you're up.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:03.014
Ready...

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.183
Fire!

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.107
Where did he go?

01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:28.999
Inside...

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:35.421
Over there...

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:37.340
Fire...

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.094
Fire...

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.199
Let's talk, alone.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:24.554
Okay. What is it?

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:26.431
I'm not an ordinary person.

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:36.691
This is not some kind of trick.
You may touch it.

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:46.576
Actually, I've figured it out
a long time ago.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:49.245
You're not an ordinary person.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:50.789
You can't kill Mr. Tan.

01:10:51.623 --> 01:10:55.251
A'gou, you are in no position to
talk to me like that.

01:10:56.378 --> 01:10:58.088
You're planning to kill him tomorrow.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:01.549
Because while he pretends to form an
alliance with you,

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.594
he has already notified
the imperial court to be prepared.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.847
Your spy in the imperial court,

01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:10.350
has already got ahold of his file.

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:15.188
Are you a fortune-teller?

01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:18.692
You study Tui Bei Tu (Poems of Prophecy)?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.152
Zi Wei Dou Shu (Astrology of Fate)?

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.737
Or have you foreseen
the mystery of the future?

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:43.925
I'm from the future.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:47.178
In other words, I came back from tomorrow.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:50.390
I know what you are going to do tomorrow.

01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:54.519
But I'm warning you,
you'd better not do it.

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:06.698
Fine.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:12.120
I promise you. I'll follow my heart.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.290
I won't do anything against my conscious.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:51.553
I have gone to warn the Commander.
He won't dare kill Mr. Tan.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:53.555
The history will be changed.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:57.016
Maybe you and Director Tiger Chen can
finally be together in the future.

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:13.635
He's gone.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:18.139
I stimulated your deepest consciousness
and pushed him out.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:23.770
And what you said earlier?

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:28.524
You mean your love with
Director Tiger Chen...

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:31.194
or...I love you?

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:35.365
You perverted robot!

01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:45.792
Did you really go warn the Commander?

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:51.130
Then...will the history really be changed?

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.092
If Mr. Tan doesn't die...

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:57.637
at a quarter to one tomorrow,

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.225
we will be sacrificed and disappear.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:44.267
In just a little while, the history will
be changed if the Commander...

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.519
doesn't kill Mr. Tan.

01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:52.191
And we will...disappear
from this point in time.

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:55.403
We'll disappear from the world.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:02.035
Will that be like
the Butterfly Lovers?

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:06.456
It's said that nothing was in their tombs
when people dug them out.

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.459
They turned into butterflies and
flew away.

01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:12.503
Why are you laughing?

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:17.342
I do prefer this version of you.

01:17:41.949 --> 01:17:43.951
We didn't disappear.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.954
Commander killed Mr. Tan?

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:57.840
I had a chance to escort Mr. Tan,

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:01.427
but he didn't want me to.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:06.182
He said he was willing to sacrifice
his own life...

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.231
so others would realize
the importance of peace.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:17.026
I smile at the sky as I die under
the sword.

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.779
I will go, leaving my soul to linger
in this world.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:23.032
He sacrificed his life for the sake
of the country.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:30.206
Since you're leaving to travel the
country,

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:32.750
could you do me a favor?

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:38.548
Would you deliver this to the Great Wall?

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.514
What are you going to do?

01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:48.391
I'm going to ask the Commander...

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:53.396
why he killed Mr. Tan knowing what's
going to happen in the future.

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.566
There's no need for you to ask.

01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:00.778
Maybe...it's impossible for us
to change the history.

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:04.949
Maybe...Commander was possessed.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:08.411
It may be a trap for you to go to him now.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.330
It has been a while so
my electromagnetic gun...

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.249
has lost its power.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:18.588
My body is an electromagnetic gun.

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:22.091
No way. Don't forget the Three Rules
for Robots.

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:24.010
You can't kill a human.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:28.598
Besides, even if you're able to force
the alien out of him...

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.101
I won't allow it. This is an order.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:34.937
Don't act rashly.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.190
Give me some time to figure it out.

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:19.815
Cuckoo is an extraordinary woman
I recruited from Russia.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.444
She started her practice of
multi-style...

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:25.279
integrated martial arts since childhood.

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:27.365
She has mastered her leg skills...

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:30.076
to the level of professional proficiency.

01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:42.750
The world is diverse,
tolerance is a virtue.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:09.610
Warning!
First rule for Robots, do not harm humans.

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.334
I'm curious...

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:29.338
why did you do it even after knowing who
I really am.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:37.722
I wouldn't be who I am if I get
easily scared...

01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:41.142
just because of a few things people said.

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:44.395
Then it's time for you to accept
the punishment!

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:46.689
Oh, really?

01:23:48.441 --> 01:23:52.862
Let's see...how capable you are.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.668
...how capable you are.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:08.878
A'gou.

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:06.519
How could you be willing to let
it control you?

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.896
It will destroy the earth
in the future.

01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:12.233
Every inch of the land under your feet
will turn into a sea of fire.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.861
It's so far away from now.
It's none of my business.

01:25:16.946 --> 01:25:20.825
What I know now is that
I will be successful...

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:22.910
and the world will soon be mine.

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:29.750
Are you sure? Why would it come out once
it possessed you?

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:35.089
You can't kill me.
I will never die nor perish.

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:38.759
I will forever exist on this planet.

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:45.516
And you...every one of you will be turned
into a killing machine.

01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:49.937
I will make humans destroy each other.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:09.999
You can't destroy me.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:52.666
What are you doing?

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.752
You will die
when you run out of battery.

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:20.027
A'gou.

01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:53.894
Why are you here?

01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:56.105
What happened?

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:02.903
What happened to me?
Where is A'gou?

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:07.783
A'gou?

01:28:09.368 --> 01:28:10.619
A'gou...

01:28:18.836 --> 01:28:20.254
What happened?

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.772
Commander.

01:28:41.859 --> 01:28:42.943
Commander.

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:44.903
Issue an order...

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:48.157
to stop dispatching our men and...

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:50.492
withdraw the whole troop.

01:28:51.869 --> 01:28:53.120
Yes, sir.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.041
What happened here today...

01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:01.420
will remained classified. No one's
allowed to talk about it, not even a word.

01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:05.382
If anyone...

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:06.884
I will make them disappear.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.735
Find someone
to write a biography for him.

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:27.613
Let him be known.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:31.366
If A'gou could know Commander's kindness,

01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:33.327
he would be grateful.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.788
I will arrange someone
to write a biography for him.

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:59.394
The King of Northern Leg

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:17.264
