00:02.961 --> 00:04.546
<i>in your family</i>
<i>money equals love</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:06.465
and I think on some level
you believe it.

00:06.465 --> 00:09.009
Well my dad offered me
diamond studs

00:09.009 --> 00:10.969
and a trip to Fiji
to break up with you.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.304
I told him he can go to hell.

Matthew:

Valentina:
<i>No. I just like that name.</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:26.944
<i>I kinda think I'm more</i>

00:26.944 --> 00:30.113
Hi. I'm Amanda Davis.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.450
‐Emilio: How many shows?
‐In Hamburg, we are gonna play
Kaiserkeller.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.077
Where The Beatles played?

00:35.077 --> 00:37.913
No chance we can just sneak
you in and out of the country
in a guitar case?

00:37.913 --> 00:38.872
What, and miss this?

00:39.122 --> 00:40.207
Natalia:
<i>I write poetry.</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:41.708
Poems didn't do anything
for me in school.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.336
<i>I love music. That's kind of</i>
<i>a poetry. Right?</i>

00:44.336 --> 00:45.337
Yeah. It is.

(muffled rock music playing)

01:06.942 --> 01:09.820
Uh, could you not.
That's for Kal.
He gets super dehydrated.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.781
Right. Sorry.

‐You did?
‐Mm‐hmm.

‐I thought that Kal‐‐
‐No, no, no, no. That was me.

No way.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.969
Well, what happened?

01:35.554 --> 01:38.765
Well, I'm‐‐ I'm more
of a solo artist

Well, the Natural Disasters

‐Hey, man.
‐Hey, bro.

‐Oh yeah?

Did Lane tell you about
almost getting arrested?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.127
All dudes

Some might even say lovable.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.637
This one time in 5th grade,
this kid tried to bully me
and by the end of the day

02:58.637 --> 03:02.474
I had him telling me about
how his mom's foot surgery
was affecting his grades.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.893
How 'bout this one?

03:06.853 --> 03:09.022
It depends on what time
you're meeting Ella's dad.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.899
If it's 1994, that's perfect.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.237
I think the problem
is less your tie

03:15.237 --> 03:16.363
and more your existence.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.448
We've been dating for more
than a month now.

Don't apologize.
You want to disturb them.

‐Mmm.
‐Keep going.

subjected to.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.718
To which detainees
are routinely subjected to.

detainees are consistently

04:28.977 --> 04:31.438
drinkable water,
even toiletries.

Pedro Balbuena. A father
of three who died in custody

04:35.859 --> 04:38.195

his diabetes medication.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.613

If you do you do.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.842
You aren't selling

You are selling people
the opportunity

a terrible injustice.

some producer's gonna
pay for studio time,

23:12.892 --> 23:15.185
I think about all the moments
they're gonna miss.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.772
My baby brother's first steps
for sure.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.901
My little sister's graduation.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.238
Because we won't have
new memories with them,

23:26.822 --> 23:29.825
I try to hold on
to the old ones

23:29.825 --> 23:31.118
as tightly as I can.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.665
I was remembering how
my father shaved every morning.

23:37.625 --> 23:38.459
No matter what.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.588
Weekends. Vacations.
Even when he was sick.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.715
He used to sit me
on the counter,

23:45.716 --> 23:49.553
so I could watch him use
his gleaming straight razor.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.807
The detention center...

23:54.725 --> 23:57.811
was the first time I ever
saw him with stubble.

23:59.188 --> 24:03.609
And when I went to kiss him,
his cheek next to mine,

24:03.984 --> 24:05.653
it felt like a stranger's.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.282
And stupidly, I said something.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.455
And the next time,
there he was.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.585
From a distance, his old self,
clean shaven.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.425
But up close...

24:31.178 --> 24:32.596
his face was raw.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.266
Covered in tiny cuts.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.481
He laughed it off and said
he couldn't find a mirror.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.818
But these past few weeks,

24:46.402 --> 24:49.822
learning about the conditions
in these places,

24:50.656 --> 24:54.159
I realized that... he was lying.

24:56.328 --> 25:00.499
There was probably one
dull disposable razor

25:00.499 --> 25:03.377
that made the rounds
from cell to cell.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.837
From father to father.

25:05.462 --> 25:09.550
Each man afraid of his children
not recognizing him.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.553
Every man ashamed...

25:13.303 --> 25:16.306
of appearing to be
just a creature in a cage,

25:16.306 --> 25:19.810
deprived of every necessity
that allows us to feel human.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.898
It's on purpose, of course.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.944
There aren't supply shortages
or inadequate funds.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.864
Cruelty is the point.

25:32.781 --> 25:37.119
Withholding anything that allows
people to feel cared for,

25:37.119 --> 25:39.371
or understood is the point.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.458
So that's the fight.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.169
It's not the biggest fight.
It's not the ultimate fight.

25:45.586 --> 25:46.879
But it's tonight's fight.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.008
Please give what you can.

25:52.843 --> 25:53.844
Thank you.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.433
(cheering and applause)

26:18.243 --> 26:22.831
And now, please welcome
my brother Emilio and his band,

another pat on the back?

'Cause...

26:51.276 --> 26:52.277
that's not really my forte.

26:53.821 --> 26:54.696

26:55.280 --> 26:56.448
What are you gonna do

28:48.226 --> 28:49.728
Man:
Hey. Hey!

Lay off him, man.

He didn't wanna play

Leave it alone, Micah.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.244
That song is called "Bedhead"
and he wrote it.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.455
Bedhead?!
We're talking about
people's suffering.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.665

Okay, people.
I need everybody to take
a few steps back.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.924
We got word of a disturbance?

30:00.924 --> 30:01.925
No. No.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.010
Everything's okay, officers.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.095
Yeah, well... what happened
to your eye, son?

30:05.429 --> 30:06.263
Who did that?

30:06.763 --> 30:09.099
There was a...
a minor disagreement.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.267
That worked itself out, sir.

Yeah, I don't have no problems
with nobody, officers.

Okay, you don't want

No, sir. No, like he said,
we're all, uh,
we're all friends here.

Be that as it may,
I'm gonna need to get

of this establishment?

I am.

I'm gonna need

Yes, sir.

Officer?

Don't, Lucía.

What's with the phone?

That's not true, officer.

Don't.

You're not making an arrest.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.722
There are no charges
being filed.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.140
So, do you have a warrant?

30:50.140 --> 30:51.308
I don't need a warrant.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.642
We're responding to a call.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.563
In California, a person cannot
be arrested for not being able

30:56.563 --> 30:59.024
to provide identification when
detained by a police officer.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.359

So you carded everybody here
before you served them tonight.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.006
Absolutely.
Nobody got a wristband
who didn't show I. D.

Is that so?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.093
All right, well.
We're gonna make sure

any minors tonight.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.219
Maybe it would have been more

34:56.219 --> 34:58.054
if I hadn't antagonized
the police.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.806
You were just
following my example.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.975
You used a script of mine
that didn't apply.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.227
It was a rookie mistake.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.396
Yeah, well... you're a rookie.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.274
You gotta start somewhere.
And you did.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.944
Tonight. Using your own words.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.615
Allison said it wasn't enough
to just tell my story.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.118
I need to do more.
Speak up in other ways.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.620
That's how Allison motivates.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.622
The thing you want
most from her, she withholds.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.665
So you have to work
extra hard to get it.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.461
You said it yourself,
deprivation is
an effective weapon.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.296
She's used it on me plenty.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.758
But you don't do that.

35:34.758 --> 35:35.925
Withhold.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.096
I'm more of a... nurturer,
I guess.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.350
Oh. I do better
with encouragement.

35:44.434 --> 35:45.435
Lucía...

35:46.603 --> 35:51.316
to encourage someone,
means to give them courage.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.821
I think you already have
all the courage you need.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.533
Really? You do?

36:02.661 --> 36:03.662
Yeah.

36:09.626 --> 36:13.213
Emilio just texted. He's okay.
He'll be home soon.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.137
Scary those cops
coming in tonight, huh?

36:23.473 --> 36:24.808
I know you've been
through that before.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.145
Once one bad thing
happens to you,

36:30.021 --> 36:32.190
every bad thing seems
possible. Doesn't it?

36:34.442 --> 36:36.194
And then those
horrible headlines.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.407
The pictures in the front page
tell you that...

36:41.032 --> 36:43.618
bad things are happening
to people like you
every single day.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.287
People with families
like yours.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.290
With names like yours.

36:55.588 --> 36:59.509
Does being an Amanda feel safer
than being a Valentina?

37:04.347 --> 37:06.057
'Cause I will totally get that.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.648
That's it.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.484
Exactly.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.748
You're smiling.
You never smile.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.499
I smile all the time.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.043
Inwardly.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.255
So, it went well with Avery?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.382
Oh, no. It went horribly.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.552
I don't know that I've
ever had a conversation
go worse, actually.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.429
Not one ounce of chemistry.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.265
I'm pretty sure she
faked a phone call
to get away from me.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.560
And that's a good thing?

37:50.894 --> 37:51.895
I talked to her, Luce.

37:52.729 --> 37:56.107
I moved my legs
and I walked up to a girl
and I flirted with her.

37:56.858 --> 38:00.445
It was bad and clumsy
and embarrassing.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.655
But, now I know I could do it.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.623
Well, hey.
To horrible, terrifying failures

38:11.623 --> 38:13.625
that turn out okay.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.090
I can tell there's something
good coming.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.928
And I feel ready for it.
You know what I mean?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.602
(inaudible)

38:38.483 --> 38:40.068
Natalia:
How long have you been out here?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.739
I've been waiting to tell you.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.368
There's something
going on with Val

38:48.368 --> 38:49.661
that I think you
should know about.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.496
Can it wait, like,
five minutes?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.499
‐I'm just trying
to call the band.
‐Yeah. Of course.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.459
(line ringing)

39:01.047 --> 39:02.799
Micah's phone's always dead.
Ya know?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.134
That's probably why
he hasn't called me back.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.555
But I texted Lane
and Asher too and...

39:08.555 --> 39:10.014
Voicemail:
<i>Your call has</i>
<i>been forwarded...</i>

39:10.014 --> 39:11.641
Well, they're probably
just out getting wasted.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.813
What are you gonna say
when you connect with them?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.609
Uh, well. Um...

39:24.028 --> 39:25.071
First, I'd apologize.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.032
You know, it was shitty of me
to walk off like that.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.286
I mean, shouldn't we be able
to overcome a moment

39:31.286 --> 39:32.537
where a song didn't feel right?

39:33.288 --> 39:34.873
We've overcome far worse.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.754
What?

39:44.591 --> 39:46.342
No, no. You're thinking
something. Say it.

39:51.347 --> 39:55.685
Maybe your reaction,
and their reaction
to your reaction...

39:57.562 --> 40:00.773
says the band's run its course.

40:03.985 --> 40:04.903
You don't understand.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.155
I mean, aside from my family,

40:07.155 --> 40:09.073
these are the longest
relationships I've had.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.411
And...
being on that stage
with those guys,

40:13.411 --> 40:15.580
is the only time
that I felt like I was
where I was meant to be.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.917
I mean, I spent the past
few months just...

40:19.834 --> 40:21.586
just wanting to get
that feeling back.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.088
You know, being apart
of something, being...

40:25.757 --> 40:26.925
being good at something.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.892
Even if I have that, or‐or
even the possibility of that,

40:35.892 --> 40:38.394
I could handle
all of the things.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.271
All the responsibilities
that I never asked for.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.315
All the stuff I...

40:43.775 --> 40:44.817
I suck at.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.785
I need it to work out
with them.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.120
Because what do I have
if it doesn't?

41:04.462 --> 41:07.340
You should go to sleep.
Try again in the morning.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.592
No, no, they'll...

41:09.968 --> 41:11.094
They'll pick up at some point.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.600
