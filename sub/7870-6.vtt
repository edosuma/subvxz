no matter what we do,
an asteroid's gonna wipe us out,

03:03.266 --> 03:04.851
And why did you
run away from me?

03:04.934 --> 03:06.853
And how did Angelica
get a new wand

03:06.936 --> 03:09.480

the Wandwood Forest? And...

03:09.564 --> 03:12.483
Look, you seem like a smart kid,

(yells)

21:21.488 --> 21:24.157
Congratulations, partner.
We did it.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.995
Hey, Neil, how come
you watched me drink mine,

21:28.078 --> 21:30.455
-but you didn't drink yours?
-It's simple, Moe.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.292
I don't like the taste... of poison.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.794
Ah... crap.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.921
(theme music playing)

21:51.727 --> 21:53.770
Shh!
