WEBVTT

00:08.333 --> 00:11.791
does that to their boss in front
of the whole organization? Huh?

00:11.875 --> 00:15.541
- Thanks for the goddamn morale
boost, you fucking cocksucker!
- I-I-I didn't mean to--

00:15.625 --> 00:17.333
I tried to give you
the fucking note

00:17.416 --> 00:19.458
- before we went into
the fucking room! I did!
- Oh, fuck you!

00:19.541 --> 00:22.000
Give the note!
I'm standing out there
with my dick hanging out...

00:22.083 --> 00:24.333
Your dad doesn't own
a firearm, does he?

00:24.416 --> 00:27.375
- Get away from my door
or you're all fired!

00:27.458 --> 00:30.458
- Alrighty.
Everybody back to work.
- On what?

00:30.541 --> 00:34.083
- Big ideas.
- Whatever that means.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.583
You know what he likes.
Go help.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.458
...fucking cocksucker,
backstabbing

00:37.541 --> 00:39.375
son of a bitch!
Fuck you!

00:39.458 --> 00:41.625
- You're holdin' out on me,
aren't you? Aren't you?
- No, no, no!

00:41.708 --> 00:44.166
- He's fuckin' holding out on me!
There's another offer!
- No, no, no!

00:44.250 --> 00:46.416
- Who is it? Who?
- No, I-- No, I told you!

00:46.500 --> 00:48.541
I told you!
It-it's not what it is!

00:48.625 --> 00:51.000
I'm out there moving
Heaven and Earth for you,
gettin' you

00:51.083 --> 00:53.125
whatever you need,
and you leave

00:53.208 --> 00:55.291
three fucking weeks
before training?

00:55.375 --> 00:58.333
- I know. It's-- It's not--
- You are fucking
boning me, Jerry!

00:58.416 --> 01:00.625
- Fuck you!
- It's not something
I'm proud of!

01:00.708 --> 01:03.458
- I will sue your ass.
- I'll understand. I would.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.333
I don't need a lawsuit, Jerry!

01:05.416 --> 01:07.083
I need a fucking coach!

01:07.166 --> 01:09.958
You know what I think?
I think you're chicken shit.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.208
- That's what it is.
- Yeah...

01:11.291 --> 01:13.583
You're afraid I'm gonna
get you all the tools

01:13.666 --> 01:15.833
you need, and you'll
still fucking lose!

01:15.916 --> 01:18.125
I'm not afraid of that.
- Bullshit!

01:18.208 --> 01:20.750
I know it. I-I know it
for a goddamn fact

01:20.833 --> 01:21.833
because I'm lousy at it.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.208
I'm a-- I'm a--
I'm a-- I'm a-- I'm a--

01:24.291 --> 01:26.250
I'm a shit coach!

01:26.333 --> 01:28.333
I am! I sit there, helpless,

01:28.416 --> 01:31.041
watching these guys,
pissed to hell

01:31.125 --> 01:33.708
that they ain't me!
And even worse,

01:33.791 --> 01:35.666
that I can't be them!

01:35.750 --> 01:37.291
I mean, if I could-- I swear--

01:37.375 --> 01:40.500
I swear to God,
if I could suit back up now,

01:40.583 --> 01:43.208
I'd play for you right now
in a heartbeat!

01:43.291 --> 01:45.666
But, I ca-- I can't--
I mean, shit,

01:45.750 --> 01:47.916
I'd die for you right now!

01:48.000 --> 01:51.333
But I can't get you
to where you want to go,

01:51.416 --> 01:54.625
screaming from
the fuckin' sidelines!

02:00.416 --> 02:02.333
You're better off
with someone else.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.291
I'll help you find the guy.
I will.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.875
I mean, I care
about this franchise.

02:11.541 --> 02:13.166
I'll always be a Laker.

02:14.041 --> 02:16.875
Team is family to me.

02:16.958 --> 02:19.041
It's my family.

02:19.125 --> 02:20.833
Now, get out.

02:24.458 --> 02:27.250
("My Favorite Mutiny"
by The Coup playing

04:40.375 --> 04:43.958
What's up, Doc?
I'm comin' for you, baby.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.291
Come on, Larry!

05:15.375 --> 05:18.500
- Hey, they'll let me drive.
- Pop, don't let him near my car.

05:21.541 --> 05:24.041
You're right, you're right.
Not my car.

05:36.458 --> 05:40.333
Remember who you are
and where you come from.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.375
Couldn't forget
if I tried, Mama.

05:46.708 --> 05:49.125
My goodness.

05:49.208 --> 05:52.041
Come on, everybody.
Let's give Junior a hug.

05:53.666 --> 05:56.000
- Aw, EJ.
Y'all get on up in here now.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.875
- We gonna miss you, EJ!
- Love you, EJ.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.041
I'm gonna miss you all, too.

06:12.125 --> 06:15.000
<i>No former players.</i>

06:16.416 --> 06:19.083
Check again, my man.
Come on. Pat Riley.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.958
It-it-it's
gotta be there.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.291
- Nope.
- Can I see the next page?

06:23.375 --> 06:25.291
- Yeah, yeah.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.750
It's the same shit.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.666
- I'm here for Chick. Hm?
- Mm-hmm.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.208
- Not on the list.
- Well, if I just go in there,
it's not gonna be a--

06:33.291 --> 06:35.125
Hey, hey, hey.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.541
Come on, brother man. Come on.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.708
Cut me some slack, will ya?

06:42.791 --> 06:44.083
I'm not some honky
off the street, man.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.083
I played here
for five years.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.958
Okay, I won me a ring. Alright?

06:49.041 --> 06:51.833
I know you got a job to do,
but I have a meeting in there.

06:51.916 --> 06:54.375
Okay, I-I promise you,
I-I'm on the list.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.750
No former players,

06:56.833 --> 06:58.458
brother man.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.333
This is some bullshit.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.000
Okay, here's one.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.333
Um, Evel Knievel. We get him,

07:11.416 --> 07:15.833
he jumps the full length of the
court right over Kareem's head.

07:15.916 --> 07:18.416
- You're an idiot.
- Well, at least it's splashy.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.958
My dad loves Hollywood,
a big production.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.541
What about live music
for the game? A band?

07:23.625 --> 07:25.250
Why not Herb Alpert?

07:25.333 --> 07:26.791
Well, since money
isn't an object--

07:26.875 --> 07:28.500
Money is the only object.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.416
- I just know my dad said--
- Yeah, I know what he said.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.375
But this team has been bleeding
in attendance for 10 years.

07:33.458 --> 07:36.125
It's been longer than that since
we broke even at the venue,

07:36.208 --> 07:37.666
not to mention turned a profit.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.083
Now, he wants us
spending more money.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.708
But if we are not bringing
in enough to cover that,

07:41.791 --> 07:43.250
we become the burden.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.791
Now your father doesn't
strike me as a man

07:44.875 --> 07:47.333
who likes to carry burdens.
Is that fair?

07:49.166 --> 07:52.916
- I think he'll do what it takes.
- I hope you're right,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.208
but I won't spend
what I can't pay for.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.291
So while you're
dreaming up a show,

07:57.375 --> 07:59.708
how about we find a way
to sell some more tickets?

08:02.708 --> 08:05.875
Alright. What do we got?
Dean Smith?

08:05.958 --> 08:07.208
Retired.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.583
Great. Fucking retired.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.833
Under contract,
under contract...

08:11.916 --> 08:14.166
Bobby Knight. Like Bobby Knight
is gonna bail on college

08:14.250 --> 08:16.750
for a team on the verge
of fucking bankruptcy.

08:16.833 --> 08:20.000
- Goddamn it!

08:33.291 --> 08:34.250
Bingo.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.916
<i>Jerry Tarkanian--</i>

<i>Runnin' Rebels,</i>

I'd put you in a lot

09:04.791 --> 09:06.416
So, there's your pick...

09:07.208 --> 09:08.583
and there's your roll.

09:13.416 --> 09:16.791
- I'll sign.
- <i> Ask me,</i>
<i>that's gumption.</i>

09:18.916 --> 09:20.791
Lemonade, folks.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.166
Lemonade.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.458
You know West.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.416
He throws a fit at
the beginning of every season.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.125
Last year,
he tore down a urinal.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.875
- This wasn't a tantrum.
- Well, I'm willing to
do it if you need me.

09:29.958 --> 09:32.208
Hell, I can call the games
and coach 'em.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.458
No need, Chickie Poo.
I found our man.

09:36.291 --> 09:40.583
- Tark the Shark?
- NCAA's been up his ass
like Ben Wa balls.

09:40.666 --> 09:42.333
He's got a reputation.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.208
- Say that to my face!
- Who gives a shit?

09:45.291 --> 09:47.166
That's amateur, alright?

09:47.250 --> 09:49.166
The whole thing's crooked
as a fuckin' jaybird.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.333
Last time I checked, paying
guys is legal in the pros.

09:52.416 --> 09:53.541
Dr. Buss,

09:53.625 --> 09:55.833
we nixed him from
contention for a reason.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.333
In my opinion, there are
other coaches out there.

09:58.416 --> 10:00.708
- Safer bets.
- Was Jerry West a safe bet?

10:00.791 --> 10:02.208
- Oh boy.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.208
Because Mr. Fucking Clutch

10:04.291 --> 10:06.125
just left us in the lurch,

10:06.208 --> 10:08.958
and I'm a pubic hair away
from fucking training camp.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.458
John Wooden, by the way,
retired four years ago, Bill,

10:11.541 --> 10:13.541
so stop sending me
bullshit files!

10:13.625 --> 10:14.958
I'm gonna ask you
one question.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.125
Does Tark the Shark
have what it takes

10:17.208 --> 10:19.750
to take my team all the way?

10:19.833 --> 10:22.250
- He's a hell of a coach.
- Goddamn right, he is.

10:22.333 --> 10:25.083
Get him on the hook,
and I will reel him in.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.416
<i>The game now, well in hand.</i>

10:53.500 --> 10:55.958
<i>Riley on the free throw line,</i>
<i>he gets the ball baseline.</i>

10:56.041 --> 10:57.666
<i>And he makes the shot...</i>
<i>Foul on Pat Riley...</i>

10:57.750 --> 10:59.000
<i>Pat Riley on the board...</i>

10:59.083 --> 11:00.416
<i>Pat Riley... no good...</i>

11:10.083 --> 11:11.833
- Oh, fuck!

11:11.916 --> 11:13.041
Shit.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.833
- Fuck.

11:16.916 --> 11:18.875
Alright. Fuck it.
I'm good. Let's go.

11:18.958 --> 11:22.375
I tried the thing in "Cosmo"...

11:23.625 --> 11:25.583
He left me...

11:25.666 --> 11:28.750
for the--
for the secretary.

11:28.833 --> 11:32.666
What's important right now is
for you to make a clean break.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.291
Some people can't bring
themselves to do that,

11:35.375 --> 11:37.791
so be gentle with
yourself, and...

11:37.875 --> 11:39.958
What the fuck are you doing?

11:40.041 --> 11:43.291
- What?
- Uh...

11:43.375 --> 11:45.541
- What
happened to your face?
- Sorry.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.833
- Sorry, babe.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.625
Just caught a game
with the guys on the beach.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.708
Needed a towel. Pardon me.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.500
He's going to be
right out of here.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.166
I'm just gonna...

12:04.208 --> 12:05.166
I'll...

12:05.250 --> 12:06.166
be in the garage.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.666
- You dropped a nut.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.583
- I'm so sorry, Sandra.
- It's okay.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.791
Are you a fucking idiot?

12:47.875 --> 12:49.791
'Cause the calendar's
on the goddamn fridge!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.666
- I'm sorry.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.958
I forgot.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.750
- Maybe put a tie on
the door next time.
- Mm!

12:58.833 --> 13:01.166
- Because my career
is a joke to you.
- Come on, Chris,

13:01.250 --> 13:03.291
what do you want me to say?
I used to come home to my wife

13:03.375 --> 13:05.458
decked out in
Frederick's of Hollywood.

13:05.541 --> 13:07.625
Now, I got a strange woman
crying in my chair.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.666
Yeah, well, you know,
I used to be

13:09.750 --> 13:11.791
married to
a professional athlete,

13:11.875 --> 13:14.458
so I guess we're even.

13:17.541 --> 13:19.291
You're some shrink.

13:19.375 --> 13:22.000
- You're some asshole.
- That's your diagnosis?

13:22.083 --> 13:24.166
There's more technical
terminology,

13:24.250 --> 13:26.666
but, yeah. Wanna hear
my treatment plan?

13:26.750 --> 13:29.541
- Well, I'm likin' it so far.
Yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah? Are you?

13:29.625 --> 13:33.458
I want you to find something

13:33.541 --> 13:35.708
to do with your days.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.625
- I think I'm finding it.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.708
- No... No.
- Mm?

13:39.791 --> 13:41.166
How about this?

13:41.250 --> 13:42.750
Why don't you...

13:42.833 --> 13:45.333
clear the ivy out of here
and get rid of this stuff?

13:45.416 --> 13:47.166
And then I could see
my patients in here,

13:47.250 --> 13:50.500
and I could come home
to find you in a teddy.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.125
- Honey...

14:13.791 --> 14:15.708
Thing's redder than
a baboon's ass.

14:15.791 --> 14:17.916
- It's a bump in the road.
- Would be

14:18.000 --> 14:21.250
if it weren't
covering a land mine.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.375
He didn't tell you that part?
Well, it seems that Mr. Cooke,

14:24.458 --> 14:28.125
when he built your fabulous
stadium 12 years ago,

14:28.208 --> 14:30.875
he didn't spend a dime
of his own money.

14:30.958 --> 14:33.875
Did it all on credit.
Balloon loan

14:33.958 --> 14:35.166
from Great Western Bank.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.916
Three million cash,
due at maturity

14:38.000 --> 14:40.583
in two months.
But, he was smart enough

14:40.666 --> 14:43.125
to pawn it off on you
before the bill came.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.041
Here you go, Dad.

14:45.125 --> 14:48.625
- Thanks, sweetie.
Thank you. Ooh, yummy.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.541
Jeanie Marie?

14:52.625 --> 14:55.125
There is a big box
in my closet,

14:55.208 --> 14:57.625
way in the back.
If you look and see--
I can't get it down.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.958
- Sure.
- Yeah.
Thanks, Jean Bean.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.000
- Mom.
- What?

15:04.083 --> 15:06.583
You cannot say
a fucking word
about this to her.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.916
Who got you here?
We keep each other's secrets.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.083
- We always have.
- You don't
say a fucking word

15:11.166 --> 15:13.750
to Frank or to anybody,
you understand?

15:13.833 --> 15:15.083
I'm already down
a fucking coach.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.208
People find out we're
one step ahead of the repo man,

15:17.291 --> 15:19.916
it's gonna be you down
on the fucking sidelines.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.416
We're not cutting bait, Mom.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.208
I need you to figure out a way
to get us out of this.

15:27.041 --> 15:30.500
- Woo!

15:30.583 --> 15:33.041
You know, I can't say
I ain't surprised you hit me up,

15:33.125 --> 15:35.208
the way I got in
that ass at Sterling's.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.750
- Here we go. Here we go.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.833
- Oh shit!

15:38.916 --> 15:40.208
Spanked you.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.166
- You got me.
- Hey, man, look.
Getting shown out

15:42.250 --> 15:45.125
like that would've
ran most back to college
where it's safe.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.375
You stood tall,
held your ground.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.041
- Respect, Country.
Well, you know,

15:50.125 --> 15:51.291
maybe you was right.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.291
I mean, you didn't have
to say it like you did,

15:53.375 --> 15:56.583
but I do got a few
things to learn.

15:56.666 --> 15:58.125
Yes, you do indeed.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.583
Like the shit you got on
for starters, brother.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.958

16:04.041 --> 16:06.458
- This here fly as hell.
- It's repugnant!

16:06.541 --> 16:08.208
Them lapels look
like pelican wings,

16:08.291 --> 16:10.666
them jeans are out of
"Field Hand Quarterly,"
and them boots--

16:10.750 --> 16:12.458
Hey, hold on!

16:12.541 --> 16:14.083
These are my favorite shoes!

16:14.166 --> 16:17.125
I love "Saturday Night Fever,"
too, but, nigga, it's noon!

16:17.208 --> 16:19.375
And who knew Ray Charles
is cutting hair?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.000
This a fresh haircut, man.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.333
Yeah, we gonna fix that, too.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.708
Don't worry about it,
young buck. I got your back.

16:25.791 --> 16:29.000
That's why they call me
<i>Savoir Faire.</i>

16:29.083 --> 16:31.583
You settle this,
I'll settle you.

16:32.916 --> 16:36.583
Meet me down the way.
Got some shit to show you.

For my premiere.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.666
Mm, I have just the thing.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.541
That's right. Your boy's
about to be a movie star.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.750
Did a flick last
spring with Dr. J.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.458

Oh, Dr. Buss.
So, you guys boys now, huh?

17:32.416 --> 17:35.708

17:38.416 --> 17:41.125

17:41.208 --> 17:44.291
So then you know real game

Get a woman feeling safe,

17:59.750 --> 18:01.833
Might as well toss
money on the dresser.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.083
Dr. Buss ain't like that.

I'd take some of that
bass out my voice, negro,

18:12.958 --> 18:15.666

the floor because...

18:15.750 --> 18:17.500
word on high is West can't wait

18:17.583 --> 18:20.041
to stick your big ass
down on the block.

18:20.125 --> 18:24.166
You know, setting picks,
rebounding...

18:24.250 --> 18:26.708
doing shit a power forward do.

18:26.791 --> 18:28.083
- Bullshit.

18:28.166 --> 18:32.083
but, you know, you seein'

18:32.166 --> 18:33.708

18:33.791 --> 18:37.041
Da-da-dee. Da-da-da.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.291

18:39.375 --> 18:42.000

Hey, Pat, come on in.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.916
Hey, listen, buddy, I'm sorry

18:45.000 --> 18:46.583
They put some new
gorilla on the door,

18:46.666 --> 18:48.458
can't recognize a living legend
when they see one, huh?

18:48.541 --> 18:51.333
- That's alright.
- Holy Christ.

18:51.416 --> 18:52.875
What the hell did
he do to your face?

18:52.958 --> 18:55.375
Oh no, I just, uh,
I banged it playing pickup.

18:55.458 --> 18:56.958
- Basketball?
- Yeah.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.583
What the hell for?
I thought you
were happily retired,

18:59.666 --> 19:01.833
you know, sailing off
into your golden years.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.583
- Yeah, no, no. It's been good.
- Yeah?

19:04.666 --> 19:07.166
- Yeah, real good. Yeah.
- Terrific.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.875
- Change of pace and all.
- Sure.

19:08.958 --> 19:11.833
Just, uh, kind of been
missing it a little.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.500
You know, being around the game.

19:13.583 --> 19:16.000
You wanna come to some?
I mean, I-I'm sure
Buss is gonna

19:16.083 --> 19:18.166
pack the comp list
with his bimbo coeds,

19:18.250 --> 19:19.666
but you're, uh,
you're free to sit

19:19.750 --> 19:23.250
- with Marge if you want.
- Actually, uh...

19:23.333 --> 19:25.333
- I was hoping to sit with you.
- Huh?

19:25.416 --> 19:27.833
I heard you were looking
for a new color man
on the broadcast.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.125
- You?
- I mean,

19:29.208 --> 19:32.041
- if you're open to it.
- Patrick, I, I'm...

19:32.125 --> 19:33.541
I'm not sure I see it.

19:33.625 --> 19:35.500
- I work harder than anyone,
you know that.
- I know.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.958
- I know you do.
- You know it. And, hey,

19:37.041 --> 19:38.916
I'm not gonna be here
trying to take your job.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.041
I-I'm not looking
for a bigger gig.
I just wanna, you know...

19:42.125 --> 19:44.083
I just wanna be around
the game, you know?

19:44.166 --> 19:45.458
I still...

19:45.541 --> 19:47.750
I feel like I have
more to give to it.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.166
I know I do.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.333
Well, I gotta...

19:50.416 --> 19:52.791
I gotta run any new guy
through Buss. I mean,

19:52.875 --> 19:55.041
- he's very particular.
- You're not gonna regret it.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.208
- You won't regret it.
- The problem is your voice.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.750
- My voice? Wh-what's, uh...
- It's...

20:00.833 --> 20:03.166
It's faggy.
I'm not saying you are one.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.375
I mean, you're a,
you're a man's man.
God knows.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.208
But, I mean,
you close your eyes,

20:07.291 --> 20:09.333
and you open up your ears,
and you--

20:09.416 --> 20:11.125
you sound like a fruit.

20:11.208 --> 20:15.416
Well, uh... Shit, that's, uh...

20:15.500 --> 20:17.708
I mean, that's,
uh, something I can...

20:19.041 --> 20:21.041
- work on, isn't it?
- Yeah. You can work on that.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.833
Hey, Chick,
all I'm asking is a shot.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.541
Please.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.041
Please.
Come on, I need this.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.208
Alright. Uh...

20:32.291 --> 20:34.583
You know what, maybe...
m-make me a tape, okay?

20:34.666 --> 20:36.916
- I'll do it.
- No promises.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.041
- No promises.
- Okay.
Hey, you won't be sorry.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.583
- Alright. Make me a nice tape.
- Love the hair.

20:40.666 --> 20:42.458
- You got it. Thanks.
- Thank you. Okay.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.083
This is Pat Riley
for the LA Lakers.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.791
Yeah, I don't see it.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.458
Alright, let's go!

20:54.541 --> 20:56.500
Okay, watch the rebound!

20:56.583 --> 21:00.166
Footwork! Quick hands!
Quick hands! Take your shot!

21:00.250 --> 21:01.625
Good job!

21:01.708 --> 21:04.250
Use your footwork!

21:04.333 --> 21:05.833
Alright, good job! Good job!

21:05.916 --> 21:08.000
We're gonna come back down,
we're gonna do the zigzag.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.583
Jesus, Tark, is your AC dead?

21:10.666 --> 21:13.375
You're gonna give these
poor kids heat stroke.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.625
<i>Hey. Vic Weiss.</i>
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

21:15.708 --> 21:18.083
<i>Tark and I have been best</i>
<i>friends since grade school.</i>

21:18.166 --> 21:21.000
<i>I've seen him rise up to</i>
<i>the top of the college game,</i>

21:21.083 --> 21:23.416
<i>and I'm about to blow</i>
<i>his fuckin' mind.</i>

21:23.500 --> 21:25.375
The Lakers.

21:26.708 --> 21:29.000
I know, I know.
It's bullshit and politics,

21:29.083 --> 21:32.000
- but what do you call this, pal?
- We had to tape the vents.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.208
Those NCAA scumbags
hid a camera.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.208
I'm a persecuted man.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.208
You're damn right,
you are.

21:39.291 --> 21:42.583
In here coaching
like Anne Frank,

21:42.666 --> 21:44.708
<i>schvitzing</i> your balls off.

21:44.791 --> 21:47.041
The bags under your eyes
got bags under their eyes.

21:47.125 --> 21:50.208
- You sound like Lois.
- That's because
she loves you, pal!

21:50.291 --> 21:53.416
Like I do.
You're stuck here in a...

21:53.500 --> 21:54.666
fucking sand trap,

21:54.750 --> 21:57.125
trying to defend your name,
and for what?

21:57.208 --> 21:59.166
For this amateur baloney?

21:59.250 --> 22:01.291
Cash your chips in.

22:01.375 --> 22:04.125
Get what you deserve
for once.

22:04.208 --> 22:07.291
- Open!
- Shit, let me hear
him out at least.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.958
How much are you in for?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.500
What? Look,

22:16.583 --> 22:18.083
- this is for you!
- Look,

22:18.166 --> 22:19.250
if you need
a little scratch...

22:19.333 --> 22:21.666
I'm tellin' you,
I'm good. I'm...

22:22.333 --> 22:23.958
I'm great.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.791
Good.

22:30.875 --> 22:33.000
So am I.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.416
- Okay!

22:34.500 --> 22:35.833
Okay, good job! Take it again!

22:45.083 --> 22:46.416
Coming!

22:49.125 --> 22:51.375
I'm here for Dr. Buss.

22:51.458 --> 22:54.083
Hi, sorry. He just started on
his hair so it could be a while.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.041
- Do you want to come in?
- Right on.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.000
- Thank you.
- Sure.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.541
Dr. Buss got game of his own.

23:04.625 --> 23:07.708
- I'm Jeanie.
- Oh! Earvin. Sorry.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.625
You kidding?
I-I know who you are.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.291
Do you want a Coke or something?

23:11.375 --> 23:13.208
Uh yeah, yeah. Cool.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.666
Thanks. So, uh...

23:17.708 --> 23:19.208
you live here with Dr. Buss?

23:19.291 --> 23:21.541
Well, technically
I still live with my mom,

23:21.625 --> 23:24.416
but she's down in Del Mar,
and I'm part-time at 'SC,

23:24.500 --> 23:27.083
so I stay here
the nights she lets me.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.541
Which isn't enough.

23:28.625 --> 23:29.916
- Cheers.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.750
So your mom,

23:31.833 --> 23:34.916
she's cool you staying here
with Dr. Buss and all?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.208
Oh yeah. Yeah,
they split up ages ago,

23:37.291 --> 23:40.375
so they're basically
just friends now.

23:42.208 --> 23:44.708
Your moms was with him, too?

23:44.791 --> 23:46.208
He's my dad.

23:48.875 --> 23:52.333
I'm sorry.
You know, you just hear
about stories about LA

23:52.416 --> 23:54.041
and all that and...

23:55.375 --> 23:56.875
Right on. Right on.

23:56.958 --> 24:00.125
Is that LA's new
favorite son I hear?

24:00.208 --> 24:02.250
- Dr. Buss?
- Ha, ha! How you doin'?

24:02.333 --> 24:04.125
- How was the trip?
- It was good.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.916
So sorry I couldn't be
there to meet you myself,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.791
- but I hope you
liked that driver.
- Yeah, yeah. Smooth ride.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.708
So, I hope you
brought your appetite

24:10.791 --> 24:13.000
- 'cause I was thinking fondue.
What do you think?
- Yeah.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.291
- Jeanie, can you get that?

24:15.375 --> 24:17.416
- Look, I was talking to Norm...
- Uh-huh.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.791
- ...and he was talking
to Coach West.
- Right.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.708
- and--
- It's for you, Dad.
Mr. Sharman.

24:22.791 --> 24:24.541
I'm so sorry.
Hold that thought, Earvin.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.083
I got to take this one. Yeah.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.791
Thank you. Hello, Bill!

24:29.125 --> 24:32.333
Uh-huh. No, we're about
to get some lunch.

24:32.416 --> 24:35.041
What do you mean,
not interested?

24:35.125 --> 24:36.583
Oh, give me a fucking break.

24:36.666 --> 24:38.750
With all due respect, Bill,
it's the fuckin' Lakers.

24:40.125 --> 24:42.166
- Bill, what did I say?

24:42.250 --> 24:44.333
I said, if you can solve
this on the phone, great.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.833
If you can't,
I'm going to Vegas,

24:45.916 --> 24:47.416
so that's what I'm doing now.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.250
Yes, right now!

24:49.333 --> 24:51.375
Well, if you can be
at the Van Nuys airport
in 20 minutes,

24:51.458 --> 24:54.000
then you can come
with me. Goddammit.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.333
Unbelievable.

24:56.416 --> 24:59.333
- Is everything alright?
- Oh yeah,
everything's copacetic.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.708
Nothing for you to worry about.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.250
I've got to go to Vegas.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.625
Right, well, I did wanna
talk to you about something.

25:04.708 --> 25:06.875
Yeah, and I wanna talk
to you, too. Jean Bean,

25:06.958 --> 25:08.458
will you take our
new friend out for lunch,

25:08.541 --> 25:09.958
go to the Derby
or something fun?

25:10.041 --> 25:12.666
- I'll be right back,
buddy! I promise!

25:15.666 --> 25:19.041
- Lakers win! Lakers win!

25:27.500 --> 25:30.208
Aw, shit.
Fuckin' Super Glue, my ass.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.791
- Fucking... Fuck!

25:33.958 --> 25:35.416
Fuckin'...

25:35.500 --> 25:38.041
- Fuck you, too.

25:38.125 --> 25:40.541
Now, what did it
ever do to you?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.041
I'm sorry.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.000
Who the fuck are you?

25:46.791 --> 25:48.625
We met a few times.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.458
Jack McKinney.

25:50.541 --> 25:53.083
I'm the assistant coach
in Portland.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.958
Oh, yeah, right.
Doc Ramsay's guy.

25:56.041 --> 25:59.791
He lets me out of the house
sometimes. Have a minute?

25:59.875 --> 26:01.708
Look, if you're here about
the coaching job,

26:01.791 --> 26:04.583
I'm not the guy to talk to.
I'm out the fuckin' door.

26:04.666 --> 26:06.708
Yeah, that's why
Bill called me down.

26:06.791 --> 26:08.500
For what?

26:08.583 --> 26:11.916
- For my job?
- I guess they're
seeing a few people.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.916
To be honest,
I have reservations.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.541
Well, fuck,
goddammit, so do I.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.958
I mean, you're...
you're a number two!

26:18.041 --> 26:20.125
I mean, this is head coach
of the fuckin' Lakers.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.875
Hell of a team.
No doubt about it.
But, uh...

26:23.958 --> 26:25.958
Well, I've had
a few head coaching
offers in the past,

26:26.041 --> 26:28.083
none of them quite
what I'm looking for.

26:28.166 --> 26:30.000
My wife says I'm too picky.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.083
Always waiting for
some perfect situation

26:32.166 --> 26:33.250
that won't ever come around.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.916
Wai--
Back the fuck up. Wha--

26:36.000 --> 26:38.083
What isn't perfect
about this job?

26:38.166 --> 26:39.958
Well, that's what
I wanted to ask you.

26:40.041 --> 26:41.416
It looks great on paper.

26:41.500 --> 26:45.333
The squad's loaded, but here
you are walking out the door.

26:45.416 --> 26:48.291
- That's my business.
- I just wonder if you're...

26:48.375 --> 26:50.291
bumping on personalities.

26:50.375 --> 26:53.958
You know, new owner, big star
like Kareem stuck in his ways,

26:54.041 --> 26:56.833
maybe that's the reason
your offense got so stagnant.

26:58.416 --> 27:01.208
- Stagnant? No...
- You know,
"dump the ball in post,

27:01.291 --> 27:03.416
watch the big man go to work."

27:03.500 --> 27:05.333
- Dependable, conventional.
- Conventional?

27:05.416 --> 27:08.291
I'd want to try something,
I don't know, a lot more...

27:08.375 --> 27:10.041
- More...
- Uh...

27:10.125 --> 27:11.708
I don't know.
A lot more unique.

27:11.791 --> 27:14.708
- Unique, yeah? Doc t--
- Hey, Jack!

27:14.791 --> 27:18.666
- Thanks for coming down.
- Oh, thanks for having me,
Bill. Jerry.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.041
Hey, thanks for
the conversation.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.666
I-I hope we can
finish it sometime.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.708
- Yeah, absolutely.
- You know Chick.

27:23.791 --> 27:26.833
- Hey, Jack. How are you?
Good to see you, pal.
- Hey, Chick. Good to see you.

27:26.916 --> 27:29.791
No, no, no, no, Bill.
I mean, what the fucking
fuck of a fuck, dude.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.125
I mean, that guy's
a fuckin' nobody.

27:32.208 --> 27:33.875
Yeah. Well, he's a backup.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.333
Buss has his heart
set on Tarkanian.

27:36.416 --> 27:39.666
You gotta be dry-fucking-
humping me, dude!

27:39.750 --> 27:41.166
- No!
- You want my job, Jerry?

27:41.250 --> 27:44.625
Oh, that's right.
You picked this week to retire.

27:44.708 --> 27:46.291
But, I gotta thank you.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.208
See, I'm learning that life,
like basketball,

27:49.291 --> 27:50.583
it's a game of control.

27:50.666 --> 27:53.458
Knowing what you can
and what you can't.

27:53.541 --> 27:56.041
For instance,
I can't control you.

27:56.125 --> 27:58.500
- That--
- I mean, I can't
control Dr. Buss,

27:58.583 --> 28:01.625
and I can't control...

28:01.708 --> 28:03.625
who he wants to
replace you with.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.708
- Boom.

28:07.791 --> 28:09.625
That's all I got, Jerry.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.208
Unless you wanna reconsider.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.291
Fuck no, Bill.

28:16.375 --> 28:18.000
Then finish packing.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.625
- What the fuck is--

28:33.875 --> 28:35.208
Woo!

28:35.291 --> 28:38.291
Hey, I ain't never been to
no premiere before. Hoo-hoo!

28:38.375 --> 28:40.333
Yeah, that don't surprise me.

28:40.416 --> 28:42.250
Do they got popcorns
like at a regular movie?

28:42.333 --> 28:43.541
I'm about to kick
your ass outta my car

28:43.625 --> 28:45.000
you don't stop acting
like a bumpkin.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.791
And don't go
getting fucked up

28:46.875 --> 28:48.375
over the celebrity
bullshit neither

28:48.458 --> 28:50.625
because most of these stars
out here broke as fuck,

28:50.708 --> 28:52.250
perpetrating like
they living the dream.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.208
- No, you gotta do it like

28:54.291 --> 28:56.708
Jim Brown or OJ do.

28:56.791 --> 28:57.958
Stay righteous, brother.

28:58.041 --> 29:01.500
- Yeah, yeah. Right on. Right on.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.333
So, uh...

29:05.458 --> 29:06.750
What?

29:06.833 --> 29:09.416
Your man Buss leave you hangin'?

29:11.083 --> 29:13.083
He had to go to Vegas.

29:14.791 --> 29:15.916
Mm-hmm.

29:17.666 --> 29:18.833
What that mean?

29:18.916 --> 29:22.333
Nothin', man. Look.

29:22.416 --> 29:24.333
Glad you could make it,
young buck.

29:25.583 --> 29:27.833
Me, too. Me, too.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.125
- I'm about to have fun.
- Hey.

29:40.208 --> 29:42.958
Walking the red carpet!

29:43.041 --> 29:45.125
Remember that little
chat we had, okay?

29:45.208 --> 29:46.500
Stay cool as a fan, yeah?

29:46.583 --> 29:48.500
- Look at this.

29:48.583 --> 29:51.541
- See, stop it. Look.
Strike one. Hey!

29:51.625 --> 29:54.666
- Hello, fellas.
- Damn! Lookin' sharp.

29:54.750 --> 29:58.000
Where is everybody?
The press should be
all up on my ass.

29:58.083 --> 30:01.041
Shit, ain't everybody out this
motherfucker a budding all-star.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.625
This shit cool, Storm.

30:02.708 --> 30:04.333
Can't wait to see my man
up on the big screen.

30:04.416 --> 30:07.250
- Hey, thank you.
- Uh, which one of you
is on the Rams?

30:07.333 --> 30:09.708
- None. We're Lakers.
- Right.

30:09.791 --> 30:12.458
- Well, let's get a photo anyway.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

30:12.541 --> 30:14.708
Ring check, ring check.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.416
Oh! Thank you so much!
Here we go.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.833
- Mrs. Cosby!

30:20.916 --> 30:24.000
Oh! Look, y'all,
it's Fat Albert!

30:24.083 --> 30:26.833
I'm gonna slide out
real quick, fellas.
Do my thing.

30:26.916 --> 30:29.916
- Hey, say hey to Bill for me.
- Shut up.

30:32.041 --> 30:33.333
Man.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.708
Magic motherfuckin' Johnson.

30:35.791 --> 30:38.041
Shit.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.083
Nigga, Michigan State?

30:40.166 --> 30:42.250
You made me so much
fuckin' money that game.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.875
Stomping all up and down on
that sorry-ass Larry Bird.

30:44.958 --> 30:46.708
- Right on, brother.
- Yeah, baby.

30:46.791 --> 30:49.458
You's a bona fide
Civil Rights hero.

30:49.541 --> 30:52.958
Making that ugly-ass white boy
cry on national TV? Shit!

30:53.041 --> 30:55.916
I bet they were celebrating that
shit in the jungles of Africa.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.791
- Man, stop! Stop, man.
I just be playin' ball, man.
- Yeah, man!

30:58.875 --> 31:00.958
- Oh, you just be
playin' ball, huh?
- Yeah!

31:01.041 --> 31:02.583
Well, my name is Zastro,

31:02.666 --> 31:03.958
and everybody around
this motherfucker

31:04.041 --> 31:05.541
likes to call me...

31:05.625 --> 31:07.291
Zastro.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.791
Nice to meet you, Zastro.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.041
Well, dig this here.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.541
I got this little thing
that I do.

31:11.625 --> 31:13.750
It's over off of Crenshaw.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.375
It's a little after-hours.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.833
Do a little dancin',
do a little gamblin', and, uh,

31:17.916 --> 31:20.041
the best damn poontang...

31:21.625 --> 31:23.125
LA has to offer.

31:23.208 --> 31:24.708
Close your mouth,
my brother.

31:24.791 --> 31:25.625
Take this card.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.416
Earvin, we gotta
get to our seats.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.208
What's going on, Silk?

31:32.791 --> 31:34.750
Walk with me.

31:34.833 --> 31:36.000
What, y'all know
each other?

31:36.083 --> 31:39.083
Dude's shady.
Lots of those out here.

31:39.166 --> 31:42.375
He ain't got shit
to lose. You do.

31:43.958 --> 31:45.583
Good lookin' out, brother.

31:50.416 --> 31:52.833
<i>Gimme that puss...</i>

31:52.916 --> 31:54.666
Oh, it's coming up right now.

31:54.750 --> 31:57.708
<i>don't use it here,</i>
<i>sittin' on your butt! Nixon!</i>

31:59.916 --> 32:01.291
Was that you or...

32:01.375 --> 32:04.041
Wait, wha--
Where's the rest of it?

32:04.125 --> 32:06.333
Back of your head
look good, man.

32:06.416 --> 32:08.541
They oughta give
that afro an Oscar.

32:10.583 --> 32:14.625
- Ain't that some...
some bullshit right there?

32:29.875 --> 32:31.666
<i>Pick it up!</i>
<i>That ball does not</i>

32:31.750 --> 32:33.458
<i>wanna just sit</i>
<i>in someone's hands.</i>

32:33.541 --> 32:34.750
<i>- It wants to move.</i>

32:34.833 --> 32:37.208
<i>It wants to flow,</i>
<i>like water.</i>

32:37.291 --> 32:38.416
<i>Let's get a move on!</i>

32:38.500 --> 32:40.708
<i>Push it faster, go!</i>

32:40.791 --> 32:45.291
Yeah.
Like what he did there.

32:45.375 --> 32:48.125
He ain't bad. He ain't--
he ain't fuckin' bad at all.

32:48.208 --> 32:51.500
Look at that.
Never stops going.

32:51.583 --> 32:54.041
- He's pretty fucking good.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.041
Gail!

33:01.125 --> 33:03.000
Where is the Portland finals?

33:07.625 --> 33:09.500
- Gail!

33:09.583 --> 33:12.500
Hey. They told me you retired.

33:12.583 --> 33:14.375
- You're not Gail.
- No.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.833
- I'm just borrowing
her eye shadow.

33:16.916 --> 33:18.500
- What's your excuse?
- Huh?

33:18.583 --> 33:20.666
Oh, fuck hell,
I'm out the door.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.333
No, I'm just, uh...

33:22.416 --> 33:24.875
Yeah, Bill's just got me
helping out on the job hunt.

33:24.958 --> 33:26.833
Well, you can put in
a good word for me.

33:29.333 --> 33:31.083
- To coach?
- That'd be a kick.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.125
- Right?
- Seriously?

33:34.125 --> 33:35.333
No.

33:35.416 --> 33:37.958
No, Chick's, uh, is letting me
audition to be on the air.

33:38.541 --> 33:39.958
Oh shit, Pat.

33:40.041 --> 33:43.375
- What the fuck for?
- Glutton for punishment?

33:43.458 --> 33:45.541
I mean, I'm telling you,

33:45.625 --> 33:47.041
I get my ass on a golf course,

33:47.125 --> 33:49.375
I'm never setting
foot in here again.

33:49.458 --> 33:51.208
No good fuckin' riddance, too.

33:51.291 --> 33:52.875
<i>Sayonara.</i>

33:52.958 --> 33:55.625
I said the same thing
about volleyball.

33:55.708 --> 33:57.083
Month on the sand,

33:57.166 --> 33:59.083
- I didn't know what I was
gonna do with my life.

33:59.166 --> 34:00.791
It's funny, you know.

34:00.875 --> 34:04.250
It's not like it's
any big surprise, but...

34:04.333 --> 34:05.875
you spend your whole career

34:05.958 --> 34:08.958
knowing it's all
gonna be over someday.

34:09.041 --> 34:13.291
But you never really know what
over is going to feel like...

34:13.375 --> 34:15.250
until you're sittin'
on the beach.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.333
You're a 34-year-old has-been.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.208
And you realize,

34:21.291 --> 34:24.250
"Holy shit. Man, I just...

34:24.333 --> 34:25.875
I turned into my old man."

34:28.958 --> 34:31.458
But, hey. If I was you,
it'd be different.

34:31.541 --> 34:33.666
Look at you.
You got to be Jerry West.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.750
You know, that kind of respect,
that kind of appreciation,

34:36.833 --> 34:39.958
I would be thrilled to
walk away into the sunset.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.750
Instead...

34:42.833 --> 34:44.958
I'm practicing my velvet voice.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.208
How do I sound?

34:48.291 --> 34:50.166
Depressing.

35:01.416 --> 35:04.541
<i>Hey, EJ! I miss you, man.</i>

35:04.625 --> 35:05.666
I got Junior!

35:05.750 --> 35:07.500
Hey, man!
How you been?

35:07.583 --> 35:08.958
Oh, boy's up this early?

35:09.041 --> 35:10.416
He's not calling
from jail, is he?

35:10.500 --> 35:12.666
Tell Mama I ain't
calling from no jail.

35:12.750 --> 35:14.458
Well, what you been
doing out there?

35:14.541 --> 35:17.625
I just went out to a movie
with the fellas last night.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.500
Oh, you making friends then?

35:19.583 --> 35:21.458
Yeah, Pop.
Good ones.

35:21.541 --> 35:23.083
Hey. Zastro sent me.

35:23.166 --> 35:25.708
<i>Here you are, baby!</i>
<i>Welcome to Zastro's,</i>

35:25.791 --> 35:28.458
<i>where we about to show you</i>
<i>the time of your life.</i>

35:28.541 --> 35:31.708
They told me Magic's outside.

35:31.791 --> 35:34.416
That boy wore a prom suit
to pull some pussy.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.000
Now, you might
know magic, nigga,

35:37.083 --> 35:39.083
but she about to make
your dick disappear.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.833
- <i> But, you know,</i>

35:40.916 --> 35:43.458
only thing on my mind
right now is ballin'.

35:49.291 --> 35:52.791
- Oh, d-did he find a church yet?
- <i> Yes, ma'am.</i>

35:52.875 --> 35:54.791
Got hands laid on me
and everything.

35:54.875 --> 35:56.166
Oh, good.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.458
<i>Hope you're eating, too,</i>

35:57.541 --> 35:59.125
'cause your mama's been
cooking up a storm for us

35:59.208 --> 36:01.666
- like it's a repast.
- Yeah, I'm eating real good.

36:03.625 --> 36:06.166
- Tell him she made pot roast.
- Hey, Pops.
Can I talk to him?

36:06.250 --> 36:08.000
I wanna tell him about that
new Tasty Ice flavor.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.791
<i>- We got two flavors!</i>
- <i> We have to go.</i>

36:09.875 --> 36:12.916
- Hey, we must be gettin'
off right now, son.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.250
- We going to church. Love you.
- Tell him we say bye!

36:15.333 --> 36:17.083
We love you!
Love you! Love you!

36:17.166 --> 36:19.583
- Out the door! Out the door!
Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go--

36:22.666 --> 36:23.791
They sure are.

36:39.041 --> 36:42.041
People think some things in
life are out of their control.

36:43.291 --> 36:45.791
Your hair falls out...

36:45.875 --> 36:48.791
the loan comes due,
the coach quits,

36:48.875 --> 36:52.000
and the guy you want
to replace him with
is playing hard to get.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.250
Nothing you can do!

36:59.250 --> 37:00.875
But I don't buy into that.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.041
I'm a math guy.

37:04.625 --> 37:06.333
For every problem,

37:06.416 --> 37:08.250
there is a solution.

37:09.250 --> 37:12.791
Just... have... to...

37:14.458 --> 37:15.916
find it.

37:18.208 --> 37:20.166
Well, no, actually,
I don't have a table,

37:20.250 --> 37:22.833
but I-I know Jerry Tarkanian
is having dinner here,

37:22.916 --> 37:25.958
and that's who I'm here to see,
so... I'm Dr. Jerry Buss.

37:27.833 --> 37:29.708
I own the Los Angeles Lakers.

37:29.791 --> 37:32.375
Maybe you've heard of them.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.166
- Yeah, I lost 10 G's
on you motherfuckers.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.000
Oh! He's with me!
He's with me.

37:37.083 --> 37:40.500
- Hey. Sorry.
- Joey,<i> gentile.</i>

37:40.583 --> 37:43.333
- Mr. Mariani. I didn't know.

37:43.416 --> 37:44.833
Don't worry about it.

37:44.916 --> 37:47.333
- See you later, Joey.
- You just gave him my whole wad.

37:47.416 --> 37:49.041
Yeah, I'm sure he earned it.

37:52.208 --> 37:54.000
And I kicked and screamed,
"I like it here.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.333
I don't wanna go
to Los Angeles."

37:55.416 --> 37:57.125
Blah blah blah blah blah.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.625
Next thing you know,
I fall in love with the place.

37:59.708 --> 38:01.916
Tark, will you
listen to the guy?

38:03.500 --> 38:05.625
What am I doing here?

38:05.708 --> 38:08.208
I'm eating.
I'm listening.

38:09.083 --> 38:10.625
I'm getting heartburn.

38:10.708 --> 38:13.166
I do appreciate your gumption.
You know,

38:13.250 --> 38:15.041
showing up like this.

38:15.125 --> 38:17.250
I'm not going anywhere.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.250
Johnny, you know that pomodoro

38:20.333 --> 38:22.125
- I got coming for Lois?
- Yes, sir.

38:22.208 --> 38:24.083
- Can we put a fucking
rush on that?
- Absolutely.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.708
- And I'll take
an espresso, please.

38:25.791 --> 38:28.041
It's on the house, Coach.
Go Rebels.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.958
See, now this is
the kind of love

38:32.041 --> 38:33.708
that you guys,

38:33.791 --> 38:36.333
you want me to leave, right?
For what?

38:36.416 --> 38:39.208
- These fucking phonies
in Hollywood?
- Tark...

38:40.500 --> 38:42.458
What you got here,

38:42.541 --> 38:43.875
it's magnificent.

38:43.958 --> 38:45.000
Of course, they love you.

38:45.083 --> 38:47.666
But LA is gonna love
you even more.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.333
- They are.
- So, let me take

38:49.416 --> 38:50.666
what you do here.
the speed,

38:50.750 --> 38:53.208
that fucking
lightning offense,

38:53.291 --> 38:55.875
let me put it on
the biggest stage there is.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.750
Don't hide your light
under a bushel, Jerry.

39:00.333 --> 39:02.125
You know what you got?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.500
A really amazing
head of hair.

39:08.083 --> 39:10.083
- Really?
- Truly.

39:12.541 --> 39:15.583
You know, I spent
so many years waging war

39:15.666 --> 39:17.125
on this fucking thing.

39:17.208 --> 39:19.708
Like the Battle of
the fucking Bulge.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.375
This guy even got
his friend to come over...

39:22.458 --> 39:23.916
- Pedro.
- ...and teach me how to

39:24.666 --> 39:26.208
comb it over.

39:26.291 --> 39:28.625
- Took an hour

39:28.708 --> 39:30.916
every day.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.458
Still wound up looking
like a plate of spaghetti,

39:33.541 --> 39:35.541
and I wasn't
fooling anybody.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.416
Now, I got a crew cut.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.750
- Looks good.
- Lois thinks I look
like a Basset hound.

39:42.916 --> 39:45.000
But at least,
I don't feel like a fraud.

39:47.541 --> 39:49.666
I'm a college coach.

39:49.750 --> 39:51.208
<i>That's what I am.</i>

39:51.291 --> 39:53.250
- W-w-what Tark's
trying to say...
- Mick!

39:53.333 --> 39:54.625
He's just saying
he's real comfortable,

39:54.708 --> 39:56.916
and it would take a lot to, uh,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.583
you know, make him move forward.

39:58.666 --> 39:59.875
Okay. How much?
How much?

39:59.958 --> 40:01.500
Jerry, let's just--
let's just say it.

40:01.583 --> 40:03.375
- Say what we think. How much?
- Let's...

40:03.458 --> 40:05.083
spitball. Uh, at least

40:05.166 --> 40:07.791
two, three times what
he's earning here in Vegas.

40:07.875 --> 40:10.750
- How about 10 times as much?

40:12.916 --> 40:15.875
- Okay?
- That's a lot of money, Jerry.

40:15.958 --> 40:19.625
- That's $750,000 by the way.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.916
And that's over how long?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.333
Per year, every year.

40:24.416 --> 40:26.333
Which, if I'm not mistaken,
would make you

40:26.416 --> 40:29.000
the highest-paid
coach in sports.

40:29.083 --> 40:30.916
Jerry, I didn't come here
to fuck around.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.791
I came here to make
you a solid offer.

40:32.875 --> 40:36.291
- You know, it's a lot
of driving out in LA.
- Vic...

40:36.375 --> 40:39.875
And he'd need a new car.
You know, something reliable.

40:39.958 --> 40:43.125
Luxurious.
I got a dealership--

40:43.208 --> 40:45.041
Get two. Get one
for Lois as well,

40:45.125 --> 40:46.791
so she can do her errands.

40:46.875 --> 40:48.916
- It's Rolls-Royce.
- Of course,
it's Rolls-Royce.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.375
You think I'm gonna
put 'em in a Pontiac?

40:50.458 --> 40:52.583
You see what the fuck
I'm dealing with over here?

40:52.666 --> 40:54.625
Hey, why don't you throw
in the whole stadium?

40:54.708 --> 40:57.333
- Tark the Shark!
- So, did we just make a deal?

40:57.416 --> 40:59.000
That's what it
sounded like to me.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.958
Couple cars, 750.

41:03.041 --> 41:04.375
Are we done?

41:04.458 --> 41:07.708
'Cause I would love to trade in
this sludge for some bubbly.

41:07.791 --> 41:10.541
- Champagne, sir.
- Ha! Jesus.

41:10.625 --> 41:12.375
You do get good service here.

41:12.458 --> 41:13.875
From the gentlemen.

41:15.625 --> 41:16.833
<i>Salut!</i>

41:28.416 --> 41:30.500
- Let's make this happen
for everybody, alright?
- Yeah.

41:30.583 --> 41:32.250
- Yeah, we'll definitely do that.
- Good seeing you.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.500
Thanks a lot.
You've given us
a lot to think about.

41:34.583 --> 41:38.208
- Jerry, it was nice to meet you.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.000
Was it just me, or did
we just get kiboshed

41:40.083 --> 41:42.833
- by a bottle of champagne?
- Wasn't the bottle.

41:42.916 --> 41:44.708
Who were those guys?

41:44.791 --> 41:46.583
Come on.
Who do you think?

41:46.666 --> 41:48.000
- Bing-bing-bing-bing.
- Yeah.

41:48.083 --> 41:49.375
Yeah. So, you know what?

41:49.458 --> 41:50.958
We ought to kiss
their pinky rings

41:51.041 --> 41:53.750
because they just saved
us 750,000<i> fassule.</i>

41:53.833 --> 41:55.833
How are we gonna come up
with that kind of scratch?

41:55.916 --> 41:57.125
Let me worry about the money.

41:57.208 --> 41:58.708
You find out what
the hell happened.

41:58.791 --> 42:00.250
- Call a cousin or something.
- I can't call--

42:00.333 --> 42:01.541
We're not letting
this slip away!

42:01.625 --> 42:03.916
Pay who you gotta pay.
Just make it happen.

42:05.875 --> 42:09.208
<i>Fight the habit of retreating</i>
<i>to your head voice.</i>

42:09.291 --> 42:11.666
<i>Set your chest voice free.</i>

42:11.750 --> 42:14.000
Oh... oh!

42:15.041 --> 42:17.375
<i>Performing vowel sounds.</i>

42:17.458 --> 42:19.333
Red baby buggy bumpers.

42:19.416 --> 42:20.541
Red baby buggy bumpers...

42:20.625 --> 42:21.875
Franklin threw Fred
three free throws.

42:21.958 --> 42:23.833
Franklin threw
Fred three three flows...

42:23.916 --> 42:26.375
Franklin threw Fred
three three fl-- Shit!

42:26.458 --> 42:27.875
<i>Expel the air in your lungs</i>

42:27.958 --> 42:30.125
<i>in one large breath.</i>

42:34.750 --> 42:36.333
Hm, hm, hm, hm!

42:38.375 --> 42:39.875
Let's do this, let's do this.

42:39.958 --> 42:42.958
- Okay.

42:43.041 --> 42:44.125
Lights out, folks.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.375
Riley with the ball
shakes his shadow,

42:51.458 --> 42:53.208
pulls up for the jumper.
Good!

42:53.291 --> 42:55.583
Two points Kentucky.
Riley with the rebound
and the outlet.

42:55.666 --> 42:57.166
Damp here on the break.
Score!

42:57.250 --> 42:58.958
What a duo.
That's a one-two punch

42:59.041 --> 43:01.750
if I've ever seen one, folks.
Hard foul by Riley.

43:01.833 --> 43:03.916
Took a little...
wild out of those cats.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.750
Alright, Riley, number 42,

43:05.833 --> 43:07.166
pops it loose
and breaks away.

43:07.250 --> 43:10.166
West, the trailer,
shoots... Scores!

43:10.250 --> 43:12.666
'Cause he's Jerry West.
One of the best, folks,

43:12.750 --> 43:14.583
one of the best to ever live.

43:14.666 --> 43:16.250
And here comes f...

43:16.333 --> 43:18.500
Pat Riley, folks, the...

43:18.583 --> 43:21.416
faggy-voiced washout
with no future,

43:21.500 --> 43:24.000
who no one thinks
will amount to any--

43:25.708 --> 43:26.791
Ah!

43:33.166 --> 43:35.708
I used to be married
to a professional athlete,

43:35.791 --> 43:37.500
<i>so I guess we're even.</i>

43:41.833 --> 43:44.791
What if you just cleared out
all that ivy and this stuff,

43:44.875 --> 43:46.416
and then I could
see patients in here?

44:05.458 --> 44:06.833
- Ah! Fuck.

44:35.083 --> 44:36.375
Mmm.

44:43.375 --> 44:45.750
Jesus.

44:45.833 --> 44:47.583
Hmm.

44:47.666 --> 44:49.458
Did you get it out
of your system?

44:50.750 --> 44:53.208
Those fucking roots.

45:00.458 --> 45:04.250
- Are you feeling bleeding?
- I'll stitch it up.

45:04.333 --> 45:07.541
Just can't stop thinking
about my dad.

45:07.625 --> 45:09.208
<i>Four games in the majors.</i>

45:10.125 --> 45:11.875
<i>One hit.</i>

45:12.000 --> 45:14.875
He spent the rest of his life
trying to get back to the plate.

45:16.708 --> 45:18.583
- Fuck!

45:22.416 --> 45:23.500
You know,

45:23.583 --> 45:26.333
every patient asks me

45:26.416 --> 45:28.500
how they turned out
like their parents.

45:32.208 --> 45:34.041
<i>I've never had a single one</i>

45:34.125 --> 45:37.291
prepared to do the work
to turn out differently.

45:38.958 --> 45:42.750
All I've ever done is work.
I worked my whole life.

45:42.833 --> 45:45.250
- Chris, that's all I've done.
- Mm.

45:45.333 --> 45:46.958
Day and night, I work.

45:48.250 --> 45:50.333
Every time I leave the--

45:51.958 --> 45:54.000
I'd leave the court,

45:54.083 --> 45:55.541
and I'd see him in

45:55.625 --> 45:57.166
<i>my mind's eye.</i>

45:57.250 --> 46:00.291
<i>fucking beer in his hand,</i>
<i>sitting in that</i>
<i>ugly fucking chair.</i>

46:00.375 --> 46:02.000
And I'd work harder.

46:03.083 --> 46:06.041
- At basketball.
- Yeah. What else?

46:12.416 --> 46:14.125
God.

46:14.208 --> 46:17.000
There's a reason that
we bury the dead, honey.

46:17.083 --> 46:18.625
Indians burn bodies

46:18.708 --> 46:21.333
and Vikings send them
out to sea. It's for...

46:22.041 --> 46:23.666
the living.

46:23.750 --> 46:25.458
So that we can move on
with our lives.

46:25.541 --> 46:26.875
You wanna send me out to sea?

46:26.958 --> 46:29.083
Sometimes, I really do.

46:34.708 --> 46:37.875
I just really want you
to find something else.

46:41.958 --> 46:43.791
Is that your big audition tape?

46:45.291 --> 46:46.375
Yeah.

46:47.541 --> 46:49.041
How'd it go?

46:50.375 --> 46:51.875
It's terrible.

46:51.958 --> 46:55.125
Alright.
Well then...

46:56.625 --> 46:58.208
Work harder.

47:09.208 --> 47:10.625
What's it like out there?

47:10.708 --> 47:12.666
Tell Diana Ross I love her hair.

47:12.750 --> 47:14.750
Hey, y'all.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.166
It's for you.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.333
Bye!

47:19.041 --> 47:20.291
Should've known.

47:20.375 --> 47:23.583
Ten girls gathered around,
it's gotta be Earvin.

47:23.666 --> 47:25.916
Now, you know I only
kept them on the line

47:26.000 --> 47:27.416
so I could talk to you.

47:27.500 --> 47:28.625
<i>Oh, everybody's going wild!</i>

47:28.708 --> 47:30.125
<i>Johnson makes the shot!</i>

47:30.208 --> 47:32.625
He wins the finals! Woo!

47:32.708 --> 47:34.250
I don't know, Cook.

47:34.333 --> 47:35.833
The whole thing out here,

47:35.916 --> 47:38.000
ain't like how I thought
it was gonna be.

47:38.833 --> 47:40.875
Feel kind of small.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.375
Like Norm.

47:42.458 --> 47:44.416
He talk like he hot shit,

47:44.500 --> 47:47.666
but he got all
these side hustles.

47:47.750 --> 47:49.541
<i>Got a store here,</i>

47:49.625 --> 47:52.333
<i>a few words in a movie there,</i>

47:52.416 --> 47:55.375
and they all... fine with it.

47:55.458 --> 47:58.250
It's just... I don't know.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.041
You want more.

48:00.125 --> 48:02.583
<i>Of course.</i>

48:02.666 --> 48:04.708
They out here treating us
like we The Sylvers,

48:04.791 --> 48:07.125
when I'm trying to be
the Jackson Five.

48:07.208 --> 48:09.166
Michael, at that.

48:09.250 --> 48:10.916
<i> Damn straight.</i>

48:11.000 --> 48:13.458
And I ain't talkin'
no Tito or Jermaine.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.791
- <i> But, Cook,</i>

48:15.875 --> 48:19.625
you shoulda seen the way that
they was up on Cosby last night.

48:19.708 --> 48:22.250
All these eyes and cameras.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.083
<i>He was gettin' all the love.</i>

48:24.166 --> 48:26.458
If you think
that's love, Earvin.

48:27.458 --> 48:29.458
Tsk. There you go.

48:29.541 --> 48:30.833
Just sayin'.

48:30.916 --> 48:32.833
- <i> Well,</i>
<i>what you expect?</i>

48:32.916 --> 48:34.583
If it was up to me,

48:34.666 --> 48:37.625
I'd have the real thing
right here with me.

48:40.208 --> 48:42.666
- I got a test in the morning.
- <i> Come on, Cook.</i>

48:42.750 --> 48:45.583
I got a orange tree
right outside my door.

48:45.666 --> 48:48.375
- Good night, Earvin.
- Good night, Cook.

48:59.875 --> 49:03.416
Mm. I was thinking a vase
or maybe an orchid.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.666
But that's the perfect touch.

49:05.750 --> 49:07.541
Mm-hmm.

49:07.625 --> 49:10.125
I'll get it out of here.

49:10.208 --> 49:13.833
- No rush.
- That's that
for basketball.

49:13.916 --> 49:16.708
Now what?

49:17.583 --> 49:18.958
Well,

49:19.750 --> 49:21.500
I had some ideas.

49:24.500 --> 49:25.666
Mm-hmm?

49:27.375 --> 49:28.916
- Oh!
- Oh...

49:30.125 --> 49:31.333
Such as...

49:47.375 --> 49:48.958
Oh, come on.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.375
Here.

49:55.541 --> 49:58.250
Hang on. You should go
get your diaphragm on.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.083
Or not.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.750
We could make
something new.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.208
Together.

50:20.958 --> 50:23.833
- Bill! Bill!
- Not now, Jerry.

50:23.916 --> 50:26.541
- Not now!
- Don't fucking "not now" me.
I saw the progression, Bill.

50:26.625 --> 50:28.958
This guy McKinney is
a fucking idiot savant.

50:29.041 --> 50:30.666
I mean,
first year he came in,

50:30.750 --> 50:32.500
he turned that team in
Portland right around

50:32.583 --> 50:33.875
- as an assistant.
- Yep.

50:33.958 --> 50:36.666
I did. I spoke to Ramsay.
It was his X's and O's.

50:36.750 --> 50:38.791
I mean, he took a squad of
spare parts and turned them into

50:38.875 --> 50:41.125
a fucking Rolex, made 'em
tick right to the title.

50:41.208 --> 50:43.291
They call it "retired"
for a reason, Jerry.

50:43.375 --> 50:44.916
- Dr. Buss!
- Huh?

50:45.041 --> 50:47.333
This coaching thing.

50:47.416 --> 50:48.708
I got your guy.

50:48.791 --> 50:51.166
Too late!
Already got my own guy.

50:51.250 --> 50:52.416
Deal's already done.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.791
Tark's driving out to meet me
at the Bay Club. Hey, hon?

50:54.875 --> 50:56.708
Come on with me,
and I'll drop you off
at your mother's

50:56.791 --> 50:58.166
when I get him
on the dotted line.

50:58.250 --> 50:59.458
Jerry.

51:00.625 --> 51:02.791
Thank you for
your service.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.291
And, hey,
what do you know?

51:04.375 --> 51:06.500
I only have to change
one name on the door.

51:06.583 --> 51:08.916
That's what you call a<i> mitzvah!</i>

51:09.000 --> 51:10.666
That means good luck in Jewish.

51:10.750 --> 51:12.333
Congratulations.

51:13.666 --> 51:14.958
You're done.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.958
Oh here, I found it.
2,500 square feet,

51:20.041 --> 51:22.208
three bedrooms,
two and a half baths.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.666
You gotta think big, Lois!

51:24.750 --> 51:26.833
Something in the hills.

51:26.916 --> 51:29.500
- You know, the stilts.
- I'm not
vacuuming a mansion.

51:29.583 --> 51:31.250
They got Mexicans
for that!

51:31.333 --> 51:32.791
<i>Hello, Vic?</i>
- Hey ya, Rose.

51:32.875 --> 51:35.250
- <i> Oh, hi, Tark.</i>
- Vic there? We're on the road.

51:35.333 --> 51:36.708
<i> He didn't</i>
<i>come home last night.</i>

51:36.791 --> 51:39.166
<i>You haven't heard from him?</i>
<i>He hasn't called you?</i>

51:39.250 --> 51:42.208
Well, you know Vic.
He probably slept at the office.

51:42.291 --> 51:44.500
Anyway, we'll see him there.
Alright. Love you, Rose.

51:44.583 --> 51:47.000
Honey, this one
looks really good.

51:47.083 --> 51:49.791
- Oh, honey!

51:55.791 --> 51:58.000
We're gonna win
it all this year.

51:58.083 --> 52:00.416
I can see it.
Tark is the last piece.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.125
He's gonna be
worth every penny.

52:02.208 --> 52:04.583
And it's a lot of pennies,
let me tell you.

52:05.875 --> 52:07.875
Are you sure we can afford it?

52:08.583 --> 52:10.166
Afford what?

52:10.250 --> 52:13.708
Well, I-I overheard
you and Grandma.

52:13.791 --> 52:15.750
- And Claire is worried...

52:15.833 --> 52:18.125
because there's not that
much coming in so far.

52:21.541 --> 52:23.541
You see that
airplane up there?

52:23.625 --> 52:25.541
You know how an airplane flies?

52:25.625 --> 52:27.833
Like the actual physics of it?

52:27.916 --> 52:29.333
Well, let me tell you.

52:29.416 --> 52:31.333
It falls. No shit.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.791
It falls out of the sky,

52:32.875 --> 52:35.083
just fast enough
with enough velocity

52:35.166 --> 52:36.833
that it doesn't smash
into the ground,

52:36.916 --> 52:39.208
and then your wheels just touch,

52:39.291 --> 52:41.250
and you're right
where you wanna be.

52:42.708 --> 52:45.750
But, you can't tell
the paying customers that

52:45.833 --> 52:49.333
because you can't sell tickets
falling to New York.

52:51.833 --> 52:53.166
But, kiddo,

52:53.250 --> 52:55.000
you can't get anywhere
in this world

52:55.083 --> 52:57.250
if you are afraid to fall.

52:57.333 --> 52:58.708
<i>Okay?</i>

52:59.333 --> 53:01.083
Alright.

53:01.166 --> 53:03.666
So, quit worrying.
I brought you with
for good luck.

53:17.541 --> 53:19.541
- <i> Hello?</i>
- <i> Jerry?</i>

53:19.625 --> 53:22.416
- <i> Rose?</i>
- <i> They...</i>

53:22.500 --> 53:24.375
<i> They found him.</i>

53:24.458 --> 53:25.833
<i>They found Vic!</i>
