00:08.580 --> 00:10.280
(electronic chirping)

00:14.310 --> 00:16.640
Good morning.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.690
(beeps)

00:21.720 --> 00:23.720
(beeping)

00:23.760 --> 00:26.600
<i>Leave it!
We've gotta go now!</i>

00:26.630 --> 00:28.660
Hello? It's Naare.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.570
- Everything all right in there?
<i>- It's Naare!</i>

00:31.600 --> 00:34.400
<i>Stall her. Uh, yes.
Everything is fine.</i>

00:34.430 --> 00:37.500
<i>Thank you for asking. Um, could
you come back in an hour or two?</i>

00:37.540 --> 00:39.410
<i>Or tomorrow?</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:42.410
Roger, what's going on?
Open this door!

00:42.440 --> 00:46.340
<i>Uh, can't because, uh,
we're all, um, asleep.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.720
- You're asleep?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:48.750 --> 00:51.790
<i>Uh, that's me snoring.</i>

00:51.820 --> 00:53.720
<i>Roger!
Well, I'm sorry.</i>

00:53.750 --> 00:56.550
<i>Nobody programmed me
to lie well.</i>

01:10.500 --> 01:13.330
Rowan. What's going on?

01:13.370 --> 01:16.340
- I know.
- Know what?

01:16.380 --> 01:19.380
You are not a Jedi.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.310
Of course not, Rowan.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.290
The Jedi are all gone.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.720
Destroyed...
by people like me!

01:28.320 --> 01:29.620
Whoa!

01:33.730 --> 01:37.470
Oh! Whoa!

01:40.530 --> 01:43.360
Now save the droid!

01:45.440 --> 01:46.440
(roars)

01:48.540 --> 01:50.400
Go! Go, go, go!

01:50.440 --> 01:52.470
I'm trying!

01:58.390 --> 02:01.360
(angry screaming)

02:13.370 --> 02:15.270
(beeps)

02:17.770 --> 02:20.630
- Whoa!
- Is that Naare?

02:20.670 --> 02:22.600
Who else would be
shooting at us?

02:22.640 --> 02:25.740
I don't know. Graballa.
Dengar. The Empire. Furlac.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.620
We are not popular.
He's got a point.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.550
(explosion)

02:31.750 --> 02:34.450
(cackling)

02:34.490 --> 02:36.590
We just lost our rear deflector.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.580
It's not like
I'm trying to get hit!

02:38.630 --> 02:41.400
I'll lose her in traffic.

02:55.410 --> 02:58.310
- Zander!
- I know, I know! I see it.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.620
Told ya she's evil.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.650
<i>I'll keep it simple, Freemakers.</i>

03:06.690 --> 03:08.560
<i>You can't outrun me.</i>

03:08.590 --> 03:10.490
You can't outgun me.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.620
<i>So give me Rowan,
and I may let some of you live.</i>

03:14.660 --> 03:18.390
- Here's our counterproposal,
Sith.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.380
What?

03:35.420 --> 03:38.720
(angry screaming)

03:40.320 --> 03:43.560
Finish me, Freemakers,

03:45.590 --> 03:48.650
or I'll hunt you from one side
of the galaxy to the other!

03:48.700 --> 03:51.700
Blast her!
Blast her to dust!

03:52.730 --> 03:55.460
(rapid beeping)

03:55.500 --> 03:57.430
(Naare gasping)

03:57.470 --> 04:02.380
(grunting, screaming)

04:02.410 --> 04:06.720
<i>Naare! How goes the search
for my Kyber Saber crystals?</i>

04:06.750 --> 04:10.390
Uh, great.
Couldn't be better.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.250
<i>And the boy?</i>

04:12.290 --> 04:14.620
Full of surprises.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.730
So what do we do now? Do we
keep looking for the crystals?

04:25.770 --> 04:28.500
- Where do we even go?
- Not home.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.510
Not while Naare's after us.

04:30.540 --> 04:34.540
I still can't believe it. How can
someone that beautiful be that evil?

04:34.570 --> 04:36.570
I mean, a little evil, I get.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.510
I even... I even like a
little, tiny bit of evil.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.420
But <i> that</i> evil?

04:41.450 --> 04:44.350
It's like my whole galaxy has
just been turned upside down.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.410
I told you,
you can't trust Jedi.

04:46.450 --> 04:49.280
They were the bad guys in
the Clone Wars, after all.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.720
Roger, Naare's not a Jedi.
She's a Sith.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.730
And in the Clone Wars,
battle droids were the bad guys.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.620
We were?
But I... Wait.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.660
This is overheating
my logic circuits.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.700
I'm gonna stop thinking about it.
Gah!

05:02.740 --> 05:05.510
Hey, guys.
What's new?

05:05.540 --> 05:07.440
Wish I could forget
all this so easily.

05:07.470 --> 05:10.570
I had a bad feeling about Naare
from the moment I set eyes on her.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.610
Not me.

05:12.650 --> 05:15.450
She told me
I was gonna be a Jedi.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.510
She told me I was going
to save the galaxy.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.450
She made me feel...

05:20.490 --> 05:22.390
Special?

05:22.420 --> 05:24.320
Yeah.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.330
But... that was just
another one of her lies.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.660
I'm not special.
I'm not... anything.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.600
Rowan...

05:34.630 --> 05:37.730
- Aaah! It's Naare!
- She found us!

05:37.770 --> 05:40.530
No, but it's almost as bad.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.716
We just lost the quantum
field regulator!

05:43.740 --> 05:45.670
Hang on!
This could get bumpy!

05:52.550 --> 05:55.480
Come on! You can do it, baby!

05:59.490 --> 06:02.320
(shouting)

06:02.360 --> 06:05.290
No, no, no, no, no! Brakes! Brakes!
Where are the brakes?

06:08.300 --> 06:12.630
Come on! Please stop! Stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!

06:14.740 --> 06:16.600
(all sighing)

06:16.640 --> 06:19.570
A near-perfect landing.
And you guys were worried.

06:19.610 --> 06:24.540
Ha-ha! Zander Freemaker,
superstar pilot guy!

06:24.580 --> 06:28.510
Right? Hey! Watch where
you land that scrap pile!

06:28.560 --> 06:30.530
(snarls)

06:30.560 --> 06:33.530
Ah... I am so sorry!

06:33.560 --> 06:37.470
Ah. Oh, good.
It's just a scratch.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.270
I can fix your ship, no problem.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.470
- It's not our ship.
- It's our captain's.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.730
And there's your problem.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.400
(gasping)

06:47.440 --> 06:50.280
Why can't anything ever be easy?

07:06.490 --> 07:09.590
Captain, sir. This kid
crashed into your ship.

07:09.630 --> 07:14.440
"Crashed" is <i> way</i> overstating it.

07:14.470 --> 07:18.370
It's more like "tapped,"
even "kissed," like...

07:20.410 --> 07:23.350
Well, accidents happen.
What are you going to do?

07:23.380 --> 07:24.710
(chuckling)

07:24.740 --> 07:26.400
Oh, good.

07:26.450 --> 07:28.650
I thought you'd be...

07:28.680 --> 07:34.610
You're going to pay.
That's what you're going to do.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.180
I can't pay you!
Oh, good news for you. o money!

07:39.230 --> 07:42.260
I accept blood,
limbs, next of kin.

07:42.300 --> 07:46.100
Let go of my brother!

07:47.430 --> 07:52.130
Brave kid. If he was a little
taller, I'd add him to my crew.

07:52.170 --> 07:55.100
(laughing)

07:58.040 --> 08:02.910
Now, Hondo, I know you're not going
to start any trouble in my place...

08:02.950 --> 08:04.220
again.

08:04.250 --> 08:08.920
My dearest Maz, I have no idea
what you are talking about.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.990
- Maybe a little.
- Don't you even!

08:11.020 --> 08:14.290
Last time, I was pulling teeth
out of the walls for weeks.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.970
So work it out, peacefully.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.270
Maz, Maz.
Be reasonable.

08:19.300 --> 08:23.340
What could these poor, broke
children ever do for me?

08:23.370 --> 08:26.340
We could do business,
Captain Hondo, is it?

08:26.370 --> 08:29.230
Kordi Freemaker,
Freemaker Salvage and Repair.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.150
You've probably heard of us.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.150
You need something, anything, hire
us, and we'll get it for you.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.220
Satisfaction guaranteed!
Guarantee not actual or binding.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.990
You crash into my ship, and now
you want me to give you a job?

08:42.020 --> 08:45.080
I almost like this one.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.920
How do I know you won't just fly
off and leave me high and dry?

08:48.960 --> 08:51.290
This should be good. You can
keep our ship as collateral.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.360
Its hyperdrive is broken anyway.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.970
This is working out just fine.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.900
Very well, Freemaker Salvage and...
whatever.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.840
I have a job for you.

09:04.880 --> 09:10.120
I would like for you to get me a little
something from, uh, the third moon.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.150
(laughing)

09:15.190 --> 09:19.060
Lost, child?
Um, no.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.050
No one's allowed
in there but me.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.120
Sorry.
I thought I felt a...

09:23.160 --> 09:26.890
A what?
Nothing.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.090
But we're on Takodana. There's
not supposed to be a...

09:29.140 --> 09:31.940
Never mind.

09:31.970 --> 09:33.270
Hmm.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.480
Three golden orbs?

09:38.510 --> 09:42.210
Yeah. Hondo says there are dozens of
them in a sinkhole on the third moon.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.250
So, why doesn't he
get them himself?

09:44.280 --> 09:48.180
Because there's going to be a catch, Rowan.
There always is.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.150
We just don't see it yet.
Hop in.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.190
(all grunting)

09:52.230 --> 09:55.230
Where am I supposed to sit?
May I suggest the roof?

09:55.260 --> 09:58.060
Uh-uh.
Not doing that again.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.140
Hey!
Get off my feet!

10:00.170 --> 10:01.270
Seriously.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.030
Okay. Here we go.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.970
Oops.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.040
Go!

10:24.420 --> 10:26.350
Oh. Perfect.

10:26.390 --> 10:27.950
(explosion)

10:27.990 --> 10:32.220
Time to settle the score,
Freemakers!

10:38.370 --> 10:41.300
Well, score's settled.
I feel good about it.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.040
- You feel good?
- Oh, I feel good.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.110
Uh, I'm so-so.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.220
Who asked you? Shh. All right!
So we're all good!

10:48.250 --> 10:50.990
We'll just show
ourselves out and...

10:51.020 --> 10:52.950
You've come
for the Freemaker boy.

10:52.990 --> 10:55.090
No! Where did you get...
You're out... No!

10:55.120 --> 10:59.350
Okay, well, yes, but, actually,
I don't care about the boy.

10:59.390 --> 11:02.950
What I care about are those
Saber Kyber crystals.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.370
Kyber Saber crystals.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.270
As I said, "sabadacas."

11:07.300 --> 11:09.270
I don't care.
I don't track the details.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.330
The point is,
they're my ticket to...

11:12.370 --> 11:17.200
Graballa's Beachside
Resort and Buffet!

11:17.240 --> 11:18.300
♪

11:20.210 --> 11:22.240
You missed your cue.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.020
It's my dream.
Don't judge.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.150
Anyway, dream becomes reality

11:28.190 --> 11:31.190
when I sell the Emperor all
those rare little crystals.

11:31.220 --> 11:35.150
The only problem is, I can't
find them without the boy.

11:35.190 --> 11:37.090
That makes two of us.

11:37.130 --> 11:41.040
Unfortunately, he's gone.

11:41.070 --> 11:43.970
Perhaps we can help
each other, my friend.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.300
You see, my ship
is in need of repair.

11:46.340 --> 11:49.310
And, sadly, I'm less of a
fixer and more of a breaker.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.200
Uh-huh.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.170
If your men can fix my ship,

11:53.210 --> 11:56.140
I'll let you have half
of the Kyber Saber crystals.

11:56.180 --> 11:58.180
Half? Not bad.

11:58.220 --> 12:02.060
Except... you can't
find the crystals.

12:02.090 --> 12:05.130
Ah, but I can find the boy.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.100
Scary lady,
you got yourself a deal.

12:17.140 --> 12:20.040
Roger, for the last time,

12:20.070 --> 12:22.970
get your elbow out of my back!

12:23.010 --> 12:25.910
I would, but if
I move my elbow, then...

12:25.950 --> 12:28.320
Ow! Your knee
is in my ribs!

12:28.350 --> 12:32.250
Which leads to... Hey,
you're standing on my neck!

12:32.290 --> 12:33.396
See?
There's no winning here.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.160
Fine. Zander, set us down.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.190
Uh, do you see the sinkhole?

12:38.220 --> 12:40.190
No, all I can see
is Roger's leg.

12:40.230 --> 12:44.130
But if I don't get out of this ship
right now, I'm going to scream.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.010
(all groaning)

12:52.040 --> 12:54.110
That hurt... everywhere.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.410
Anybody seen my servo processor?

12:56.440 --> 12:59.940
Don't ask where it was.
You don't want to know.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.350
Guys?
I found the sinkhole.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.040
Great!

13:04.080 --> 13:06.280
And not so great.

13:08.390 --> 13:11.260
(roaring)

13:11.290 --> 13:13.190
Wild varactyls.

13:13.230 --> 13:16.200
Strong. Deadly.
Carnivorous.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.330
And there's your catch.

13:19.370 --> 13:23.300
Oh, how are we going to get the
golden orbs out of that mess?

13:23.340 --> 13:27.210
Um, this may be a stupid question,
but do varactyls... sleep?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.210
(snoring)

13:38.150 --> 13:40.020
Let me get this straight.

13:40.050 --> 13:43.350
You need me to be
the "snipe spotter"?

13:43.390 --> 13:47.360
Yep! Don't want anybody sniping those
golden orbs before we grab 'em.

13:47.390 --> 13:50.290
That's boring.
Give me Roger's job.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.970
Deal!
No deal.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.940
We need you to do this, Rowan.

13:53.970 --> 13:57.270
If one pirate wants those orbs, other
pirates probably want them too,

13:57.300 --> 13:59.230
and we can't afford
to get sniped.

13:59.270 --> 14:01.170
So, spot those snipes.

14:01.210 --> 14:03.210
Fine.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.140
Fire her up, Zander!
Yah!

14:07.180 --> 14:09.080
If it's any consolation,

14:09.120 --> 14:13.090
I wish it were you
doing this job too!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.190
(sighs)

14:15.220 --> 14:17.120
(whimpering)

14:17.160 --> 14:20.130
- "Snipe spotter"? -Look, the
poor kid's been through a lot.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.900
He's shaken. He needs to sit
this one out for his own good.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.370
- I guess.
- Look out!

14:25.400 --> 14:28.970
Plus, this is not gonna be a blue milk run.
This might be dangerous.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.060
- Yeah.
- Aaah!

14:31.100 --> 14:33.970
It's not like we've got room
in here to spare. Zander!

14:34.010 --> 14:36.280
- Okay, I can't argue with that.
- Kordi! Zander!

14:36.310 --> 14:38.280
- (growls)
- (both gasp)

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
(sighs)

14:48.190 --> 14:51.260
Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored.
Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.130
Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.130
Roger, you ready?

14:56.160 --> 14:59.160
- Does it matter if I say "no"?
- Nope. No, it doesn't.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.930
<i>See anything?</i>
Yes.

15:06.970 --> 15:10.030
<i>I see a lot of things.
A whole lot of things!</i>

15:10.080 --> 15:12.880
Golden orbs?

15:12.950 --> 15:14.980
Roger, roger.
<i>Grab three.</i>

15:15.010 --> 15:17.310
No, strike that.
Grab five! Eight!

15:17.350 --> 15:20.020
Grab as many as you can carry.
Oh! Then grab more!

15:20.050 --> 15:22.350
Kordi, didn't Hondo say
he only needed three?

15:22.390 --> 15:25.290
We still need a quantum field
regulator, and those aren't cheap.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.900
Okay, pull me up.

15:28.930 --> 15:30.370
Yeah, but why get greedy?

15:30.400 --> 15:32.370
It's not greedy
when you're desperate.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.110
Whoa! Whoa! Ah.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.280
Ah. Ah! Wh...

15:41.310 --> 15:44.180
Whoa! Whoa!

15:44.210 --> 15:48.980
(roaring)

15:51.150 --> 15:53.090
Bored. Bored. Bored.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.990
(Roger screaming)

15:56.020 --> 15:58.050
Okay, maybe it was
a little greedy.

15:59.430 --> 16:02.860
- Thrusters! Hit the thrusters!
- I am! I am!

16:02.900 --> 16:04.030
Aaah!

16:04.060 --> 16:05.920
Oh, no.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.870
(roaring)

16:07.900 --> 16:09.870
(gasps)

16:11.970 --> 16:13.300
Stop!

16:16.240 --> 16:19.170
How much of this...
Oof... can we take?

16:19.210 --> 16:21.270
If I'm being optimistic,
not much.

16:21.310 --> 16:24.140
Oh! Not much at all.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.990
(screaming)

16:30.120 --> 16:34.890
Okay, I get you're upset,
but that was uncalled for.

16:40.870 --> 16:42.840
I hope the Force is with me.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.740
Yah!

16:53.210 --> 16:54.770
Claws off my family!

16:57.820 --> 17:01.660
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.
I really don't.

17:01.690 --> 17:04.660
So I'm just going to take three
of these orb thingies, and...

17:04.690 --> 17:07.700
And... and...

17:07.730 --> 17:11.099
You've got so many.
Why do you even care?

17:11.130 --> 17:14.040
I mean, what are they to you?

17:14.069 --> 17:15.069
Rowan?

17:17.970 --> 17:22.839
I... I feel... pain,

17:22.880 --> 17:24.780
fear.

17:24.810 --> 17:28.750
This... This...
This is wrong, Kordi.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.910
The varactyls, they're just
protecting their family.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.850
Like we do.

17:33.890 --> 17:36.160
Rowan!
What are you doing?

17:36.190 --> 17:38.160
The right thing.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.130
I'm sorry.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.690
We didn't know these are...

17:45.730 --> 17:48.030
eggs.

17:48.070 --> 17:50.070
(chirping)

17:53.770 --> 17:57.940
Oh.
That changes everything.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.980
(squealing)

18:07.090 --> 18:10.860
You were wrong, Rowan. Kordi, we
couldn't just take their eggs!

18:10.890 --> 18:14.900
We'll find some other way to pay off
Hondo and get the <i> StarScavenger</i> fixed.

18:14.930 --> 18:16.860
You didn't let me finish.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.900
You were wrong... when you
said you aren't special.

18:19.930 --> 18:23.760
You're the most special kid
in the whole galaxy.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.730
Yeah, I'd pat you
on the back, but, uh...

18:27.770 --> 18:30.770
Working on it.
I'm working on it.

18:30.810 --> 18:35.780
So, I blasted him out
of the airlock and said,

18:35.820 --> 18:41.120
"Well, you win. Now you've got
all the space you need!"

18:41.150 --> 18:42.680
(laughing)

18:42.720 --> 18:45.120
Hondo!
Those orbs are eggs!

18:45.160 --> 18:47.700
- And you knew it!
- Of course I knew it.

18:47.730 --> 18:49.700
- You didn't?
- No!

18:49.730 --> 18:54.170
Oh, this is embarrassing
for you.

18:54.200 --> 18:59.010
Varactyl eggs fetch a handsome
price on the black market.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.940
So, where are my eggs?

19:01.970 --> 19:04.840
Where they belong...
With their families!

19:04.880 --> 19:07.920
We're not doing that job. I don't
care what we did to your ship!

19:07.950 --> 19:10.850
Reminder... barely a scratch. We
can work out some other deal.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.950
Yes, off of the howling
success of this one.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.920
(all laughing)

19:16.960 --> 19:19.790
I don't think you are very good
at understanding things.

19:19.830 --> 19:24.830
I sent you
for three golden orbs.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.760
Now, regretfully,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.760
I must settle for
three broken heads.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.740
Gentlemen... Ow!

19:35.770 --> 19:38.700
Hondo! Where did she learn
to throw like that?

19:38.740 --> 19:42.710
Did I hear you say you sent
these kids out for golden orbs?

19:42.750 --> 19:46.120
Kids! You don't see
anything wrong with that?

19:46.150 --> 19:48.710
Yes, I do.
They didn't bring me any.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.730
Can you believe...
Ow! Oh!

19:50.760 --> 19:54.160
Get out, and don't come back
till I'm done being mad at you.

19:54.190 --> 19:57.960
But, Maz, Maz, Maz, how can
you be mad at me... Oh!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.130
When I'm so charming
and... Ow!

20:00.170 --> 20:02.170
Okay, we're going, we're going!

20:02.200 --> 20:05.000
My goodness.
We've got to hide the mugs.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.980
No decency left
in this galaxy, I swear.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.970
You three, follow me.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.110
Look, I can't have
you kids here.

20:13.150 --> 20:16.020
It's bad for business,
worse for you.

20:16.050 --> 20:17.950
So tell me what it is you need.

20:17.980 --> 20:20.010
Right now, we need
a quantum field regulator.

20:20.050 --> 20:22.850
Is that all?

20:22.890 --> 20:25.990
- What type?
- Um, double-A type?

20:26.030 --> 20:27.930
For a Class "D" salvage ship?

20:29.830 --> 20:31.800
Double-A type.
Take it.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.770
Whoa. Hey, what else
you got in there?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.770
Nothing for you, flyboy.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.900
Your little brother, on the
other hand, I like his smile.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.740
And I love the way
he stood up to Hondo.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.850
That kind of spirit
deserves something.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.110
I think you'll like this.

20:55.150 --> 20:57.110
A Kyber Saber crystal!

20:57.160 --> 20:59.730
Is that what this old thing is?

20:59.760 --> 21:02.800
I thought it was
just a pretty rock.

21:02.830 --> 21:06.070
Found it on Rodia ages ago.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.070
How can we ever thank you?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.740
For starters, you can leave.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.730
Don't get me wrong.

21:13.770 --> 21:16.130
I like you.
You're nice kids.

21:16.180 --> 21:21.150
But two things we don't
do here... nice and kids.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.180
So off you go.
Thanks, Maz.

21:23.220 --> 21:26.720
You're welcome, sweetie.

21:26.750 --> 21:31.020
Child. The quest for the Kyber Saber
crystals is a worthy pursuit.

21:31.060 --> 21:35.200
But when you get desperate,
and you will get desperate,

21:35.230 --> 21:38.100
seek out the Maker of Zoh.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.740
The Maker of... Zoh?

21:40.770 --> 21:43.200
"Zoh"? Zoh what?
Did I say something?

21:43.240 --> 21:47.040
Must be losing it
in my old age. Bye!

21:47.770 --> 21:50.100
The Maker of Zoh.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.170
Rowan, keep up!

21:52.210 --> 21:54.040
I'm coming!
