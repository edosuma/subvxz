Last week
on "Perfect Strangers."

00:04.437 --> 00:07.674
I have great news.
We're going skiing.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.644
No way are you getting me
up on that mountain.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.412
Hi, Larry. Ready
to hit the slopes?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.750
As soon as we get up there,
I'll insist we go for one run

00:16.783 --> 00:18.318
before the lifts close.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.586
Then, after about
a 100 yards

00:19.620 --> 00:22.255
I'll fall in a soft spot,
fake an injury..

00:22.288 --> 00:23.524
and spend the rest
of the weekend getting sympathy

00:23.557 --> 00:24.825
from Jennifer.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.827
Well, in Mypos, we have
a saying.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.229
It says, "He who lies...

00:29.262 --> 00:31.798
...falls into a deep pit."

00:33.567 --> 00:36.336
I'm skiing. Ooh!

00:36.369 --> 00:38.338
Aah! Ohh!

00:40.273 --> 00:42.776
We slide down the wrong side
of the mountain..

00:42.809 --> 00:44.511
...wander around for two hours,

00:44.545 --> 00:46.212
and now we're stuck
in this cabin..

00:46.246 --> 00:47.781
...with the girls
for the whole night.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.187
You don't have
to thank me now.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.291
I think we just
had an earthquake.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.160
They don't have
earthquakes in Wisconsin.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.728
It was probably just
an avalanche.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.531
(all)
Avalanche!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.632
Cousin Larry!

01:11.505 --> 01:14.474
Oh, cousin,
we're buried alive.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.209
Not for long.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.811
Very soon we'll all be dead.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.322
Exactly what do
you mean, "trapped?"

03:10.757 --> 03:13.426
She means the cabin is buried
under tons of snow and..

03:13.459 --> 03:14.728

that's what she meant.

Alright, alright.
Let's not panic.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.871
‐ What are we going to do?
‐ We're gonna die.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.743
I don't wanna die.
I wanna leave, now.

03:29.776 --> 03:30.977
Jennifer, you can't go anywhere.

Jennifer, a mountain
just fell on us.

Well, just because I'm gonna die
doesn't mean I have to look bad.

Larry, can't you think
of a way to get us out of here?

04:22.529 --> 04:23.730
I will.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.967
I will.

Larry, there is
no way out of here.

Balki, she's right.
There's no way out of here.

We are going to die.

Now, let's look

We're still alive.

We have blankets

We have the sun in the morning
and the moon at night.

You know, you are brilliant.

‐ I don't have a plan.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.812

‐ When? When?
‐ Well, I..

Nope, no. Uh...

just entertain yourselves

right back to you?

very complicated plan..

06:17.878 --> 06:21.381

the very fine details.

disappointed, aren't they?

‐ No, I don't think so.
‐ Why not?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.731
Because I just
thought of a plan.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.600
You did? What's the plan?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.502
We're going to dig
a tunnel out of here.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.138
That's the plan?

06:45.171 --> 06:47.173
We're going to dig
a tunnel through the snow?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.474
That is correct.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.443
Balki...if we dig a tunnel

06:50.476 --> 06:52.613
it'll collapse and we will
be crushed to death.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.588
Alright, here's the plan.

to keep it on the paper.

‐ We don't wanna make a mess.
‐ You're expecting guests?

Of course, I'm afraid.

"We have nothing to fear
but fear itself."

That was President Roosevelt.

He said it too?

08:01.948 --> 08:03.617
He must have heard
it from my father.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.988
My father taught me
how to deal with fear.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.758
He said, "You take that fear
and you mush it into a ball..

it in your pocket.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.564

and it can't hurt you."

in your pocket?

Yes, cousin, you just mush it up
and put it in a ball..

pocket, just like this.

‐ Through the snow?
‐ None.

Balki. Balki, there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

13:39.485 --> 13:43.389
Yes, and every rolling stone
has a silver lining, doesn't it?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.892
No, no, Balki, there is a light
at the end of this tunnel.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.561
Look, look.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.863
‐ Oh, cousin. Cousin.
‐ We made it. We made it.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.612
It's Larry. We're saved.

14:05.646 --> 14:07.380
Hi, Larry.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.616
Oh, no, no, no.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.129
How did you guys
get over here?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.631
I'll let you fill
that one, cousin.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.334
It's all my fault.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.637
I tunneled in a circle.

14:30.671 --> 14:33.607
I can't do anything right.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.308
I'm an albatross.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.177
A Jonah.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.312
A bad‐luck charm.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.282
I'd tell you to cast me outside
if we could just get outside.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.587
You shouldn't be so
hard on yourself, Larry.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.922
Oh, yes, I should.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.191
I am dirt.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.960
If it wasn't
for my snowball of lies

14:53.994 --> 14:55.996
we wouldn't be stuck
in this pit.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.065
Jennifer.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.267
Jennifer.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.238
Jennifer.

15:16.517 --> 15:20.253
Jennifer, I lied to you
about skiing at Innsbruck.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.624
I've never raced
a giant slalom.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.527
The truth is, I can't
ski at all, I just..

15:28.394 --> 15:31.464
I just wanted you to like me
as much as I like you.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.302
Larry, I don't know
what to say. I'm..

15:36.336 --> 15:38.238
I'm flattered that you would go
to so much trouble

15:38.271 --> 15:40.040
to impress me yet..

15:40.073 --> 15:42.943
...repulsed at the thought that
it might cost us our lives. I..

15:46.647 --> 15:48.615
Don't be too angry
with him, Jennifer.

15:48.649 --> 15:52.052
Think of him as one who
loved not wisely, but too well.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.326
I think that's Shakespeare.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.095
Or Moonlighting.

16:04.565 --> 16:05.966
I forgive you, Larry.

16:07.568 --> 16:08.969
Thank you.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.974
I just want you to know I think
you're a fine group of people..

16:15.408 --> 16:17.377
...and it's an
honor to die with you.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.712
Ditto.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.216
Wait a minute.

16:23.249 --> 16:26.520
I can't believe the babasticki
that I'm hearing.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.454
You're giving up.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.457
And you call
yourselves Americans?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.795
What ever happened to,
"I have not yet begun to fight"?

16:34.828 --> 16:36.697
"Don't give up the ship."

16:36.730 --> 16:38.131
"Have it your way."

16:39.700 --> 16:42.102
Americans aren't quitters.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.370
If George Washington
had given up at Valley Forge...

16:44.404 --> 16:46.406
...we'd all be
speaking English today.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.247
Now, I'm going back
in that tunnel

16:54.280 --> 16:56.416
and I'm going
to make a sharp left.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.185
Are you coming with me?

17:00.821 --> 17:04.457
Balki's right.
We're Americans.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.627
If we're gonna go down,
we're gonna go down fighting.

17:07.661 --> 17:10.130
It's just that
I am so tired.

17:12.766 --> 17:18.070
Oh, cousin, cousin,
it's okay. It's okay.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.741
Listen, everybody gets tired.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.175
George Washington got tired.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.145
That's why he
slept everywhere.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.587
Now, I'm going to go back
in the tunnel

17:33.620 --> 17:35.455
and do some digging.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.324
You take a nap, and when it's
time for you to relieve me

17:38.358 --> 17:40.160
I'll wake you up.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.262
Good luck, Balki.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.097
Here's something
to keep you warm.

17:49.670 --> 17:51.137
Oh..

17:54.307 --> 17:56.109
Be careful.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.544
Be careful back there.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.728
Ow.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.697
Ice Station Zebra?

18:22.703 --> 18:24.404
Good morning.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.172
Where's Balki?

18:26.206 --> 18:27.340
He must still be
in the tunnel.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.476
What a guy.

18:30.511 --> 18:32.245
He didn't even wake me up
to relieve him.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.821
Oh, no.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.525
‐ Balki? Balki?
‐ Oh, no. I can't be...

18:44.558 --> 18:48.428
‐ Balki! Balki! Balki!
‐ Oh, God.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.198
‐ Balki! Balki.
‐ Larry. Larry.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.635
‐ Balki.
‐ Larry, there's too much snow.

18:54.668 --> 18:56.670
The tunnel's collapsed.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.840
No, no, I gotta save him.
I've got to save him.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.775
Balki, Balki.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.511
Balki, Balki.

19:04.545 --> 19:09.215
Larry. The tunnel must
have collapsed hours ago.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.684
That's why he
didn't wake you up.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.485
Oh...Oh..

19:12.519 --> 19:14.254
Oh, this can't be happening.

19:15.722 --> 19:19.392
I belong
in the pit, not him. Oh..

19:19.425 --> 19:21.928
Oh, why‐why didn't I
listen to him

19:21.962 --> 19:24.297
instead of
to my own hormones?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.736
Why do you have to be
so damned attractive?

19:29.770 --> 19:32.906
‐ I'm sorry, Larry.
‐ Oh, oh..

19:32.939 --> 19:34.474
Listen to me.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.711
I‐I have just killed
the sweetest, bravest man

19:37.744 --> 19:39.345
I have ever known...

19:39.379 --> 19:40.914
...and now I'm
trying to blame it on you.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.985
He came to America,
looking for a new life.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.387
He moved in with a cousin
he didn't even know.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.455
I thought I was
doing him a favor, no.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.458
I was the lucky one.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.697
If I know anything
about the goodness

19:56.730 --> 19:58.932
and purity in life..

19:58.965 --> 20:01.201
...it's because
Balki Bartokomus taught me.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.371
We're gonna
miss him too, Larry.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.373
Oh..

20:07.407 --> 20:09.810
I will never
forgive myself for this.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.612
I think Balki
would forgive you.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.714
Of course, he would.

20:13.747 --> 20:15.616
Even dead,
he's a better man than me.

20:19.620 --> 20:24.357
If I could just hear
his voice one more time.

20:27.828 --> 20:29.229
(Balki)
'Cousin Larry?'

20:32.398 --> 20:34.334
[sobbing]

20:37.403 --> 20:40.340
If I could just see him again

20:40.373 --> 20:42.709
and‐and‐and tell him
how much he meant to me.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.979
I think he's up there.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.280
Of course he is.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.350
He was a saint.

20:52.686 --> 20:56.557
No, no, no. I mean,
I think he's on the roof.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.324
(Balki)
'Cousin, can you hear me?'

21:00.393 --> 21:02.462
Balki? Balki?

21:02.495 --> 21:03.930
He's alive. He's alive.

21:03.964 --> 21:06.533
Balki! You're alive!

21:06.567 --> 21:09.402
Well, of course
I am, don't be ridiculous.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.371
What am I gonna be? Dead?

21:16.843 --> 21:20.446
I can see the search party
from here. They're coming soon.

21:21.882 --> 21:23.416
It's a wonderful day.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.087
Yes. Yes, it sure is.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.724
Yes. We're saved. Ow. Ooh...

21:30.757 --> 21:32.492
We're saved. Ow.

21:35.095 --> 21:36.429
We're saved.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.403
[instrumental music]

21:46.673 --> 21:48.642
[laughs]

21:48.675 --> 21:49.943
Bye‐bye.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.945
Alright, listen.
Live and learn.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.714
Live and learn.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.955
Oh, cousin, no.

22:02.856 --> 22:04.490
[mumbles]

22:04.525 --> 22:06.560
Well, no,
I agree with you there.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.962
[mumbles]

22:08.995 --> 22:11.364
Well, no, no, no.
I don't know about that.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.767
[mumbles]

22:13.800 --> 22:16.469
Well, of course not,
don't be ridiculous.

22:18.739 --> 22:21.642
Oh, cousin, I
know, I know what it is.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.944
You're still feeling
like a big slime ball.

22:26.547 --> 22:29.683
‐ You're too kind.
‐ Oh..

22:29.716 --> 22:31.952
Oh, no, cousin.
Listen. Listen, listen.

22:31.985 --> 22:33.787
I know how to cheer you up.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.922
No, no.

22:35.956 --> 22:38.959
I don't think
that's possible.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.665
Oh, yes, it is,
cousin. Now, listen to me.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.968
Jennifer told me that
she thinks you are brave.

22:53.006 --> 22:56.009
No, you're the
one that saved us.

22:58.679 --> 23:00.080
Well, that's
a very good point.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.949
Oh..

23:02.983 --> 23:04.918
She told me she
thinks you are clever.

23:08.955 --> 23:12.158
No, you're one who
came up with all the ideas.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.029
Well, that's true.
That's very, very true.

23:18.064 --> 23:22.035
She‐she told me that she
thought that you were...cute.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.981
Did she really say
she thinks I'm cute?

23:36.482 --> 23:38.819
Well, of course
she did. I don't lie.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.121
No, I'm the one who lies.

23:43.156 --> 23:45.626
But I'm basically
an honest man.

23:45.659 --> 23:48.862
I‐I never lied to my parents.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.964
I never cheated in school.

23:50.997 --> 23:55.001
It's just that when
I'm around Jennifer, I‐‐

23:55.035 --> 23:57.771
‐ You lose your mind.
‐ Yeah.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.643
You're getting better.
You told her the truth.

24:02.676 --> 24:04.945
Yeah, I guess I did.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.919
‐ And do you know why?
‐ No.

24:14.655 --> 24:17.490
Because, if you know
anything about the goodness

24:17.524 --> 24:18.925
and purity in life..

24:18.959 --> 24:20.527
...Balki Bartokomus taught you.

24:20.561 --> 24:21.628
Yeah.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.734
Wait a minute.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.672
How long were
you up on that roof?

24:33.173 --> 24:35.108
Saint Balki.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.545
I like that.
