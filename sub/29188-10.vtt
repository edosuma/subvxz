00:08.225 --> 00:10.880
Previously onWhy Women Kill...TAYLOR: She was kicked

00:10.923 --> 00:13.361
out of her third home because
her foster mother accused her

00:13.404 --> 00:14.753
of trying to seduce
her husband.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.320
A week later,
that house burned down.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.105
You did those things?You can't believe

00:18.148 --> 00:19.628
a fucking word he says!Jade, watch out!

00:21.195 --> 00:23.066
NURSE:
Before we put him out,

00:23.110 --> 00:24.328
he wrote you this note.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.374
Said it was
important.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.071
Did you talk to him?DUKE:
No.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.681
Taylor came to see me in jail.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.640
You really fucked me this time!

00:35.426 --> 00:37.994
Your membership to the club
has been revoked.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.691
It's because I'm ill.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.954
It was you.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.652
You seduced

00:43.695 --> 00:45.175
my child.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.003
Do you think
that I would be satisfied

00:47.047 --> 00:49.266
just getting you kicked
out of a country club?

00:49.310 --> 00:52.704
I am just getting started,
bitch.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.315
Dad always said
that you were vindictive.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.968
I am still your mother.

00:56.012 --> 00:59.059
No, from now on, you're just
some lady that I used to know.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.148
You pulling out?Not yet.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.759
I'm waiting for someone.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.978
MARY: My husband likes to threaten me with a loaded gun

01:06.022 --> 01:08.155
he keeps in his bedside drawer.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.505
BETH ANN:
Our daughter died
because of me.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.898
I'm the one who's responsible.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.987
The last time I slept
with your husband

01:15.031 --> 01:16.641
was the day your child died.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.252
While you were coming
in the front door,

01:18.295 --> 01:21.124
I ran around the side
of the house.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.387
Did Rob know
you had not closed the gate?

01:23.431 --> 01:25.955
I called him that
night and I told him.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.261
What can I do for you?

01:27.304 --> 01:28.697
I need to buy a gun.

01:40.578 --> 01:43.668
♪ "L" is for the way you look

01:43.712 --> 01:46.454
♪ At me

01:46.497 --> 01:49.979
♪ "O" is for the only one

01:52.938 --> 01:56.246

02:47.254 --> 02:49.386
So, what do you think?

02:49.430 --> 02:51.867
It's impressive.
Square footage?

02:51.910 --> 02:53.390
5,000.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.739
Give or take.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.176
Four big bedrooms upstairs.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.003
Got kids?

02:58.047 --> 02:59.483
We had a little girl.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.268
Her name was Emily.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.095
Was?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.272
Could you excuse us a moment?

03:10.842 --> 03:15.064
You've got to stop telling total
strangers our daughter died.

03:15.107 --> 03:16.805
He asked me a question.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.807
It's been over a year.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.157
How are we gonna
move forward in our lives

03:21.201 --> 03:23.159
if we keep talking
about what happened?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.813
I don't even understand
what we're doing here.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.380
The house we have now is fine.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.859
It's got
too many memories.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.905
We need a fresh start.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.213
I mean, this could be
good for us.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.345
Don't you want to find a way
to be happy again?

03:35.389 --> 03:37.304
Of course I do.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.219
Well, then let me buy this
for you.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.308
If you do that,
I'll spend every day

03:41.351 --> 03:44.267
just trying to put the smile
back on your face.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.227
The one I fell in love with.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.057
I guess we could be happy here.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.103
Of course we can.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.542
Now where's that smile I love?

03:59.587 --> 04:01.153
I bought a gun yesterday.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.113
What?

04:04.156 --> 04:06.115
I'd left an appointment
at my cancer doctors,

04:06.158 --> 04:08.335
and I passed the most
adorable gun shop.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.034
And I bought this
little revolver.

04:12.077 --> 04:14.297
Why do we need a gun?

04:14.341 --> 04:16.125
There have been robberies
in the neighborhood.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.822
Mrs. Betz on the corner?

04:17.866 --> 04:20.434
Some thief smashed her
window, reached in,

04:20.477 --> 04:22.871
and took her new purse
right off her end table.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.699
Have I met her?Anyway,

04:24.742 --> 04:26.222
I don't feel safe.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.442
So I got this gun, and
I'm storing it here.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.487
And I've already
put in the bullets.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.057
You're keeping the gun loaded?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.841
If someone attacks us,
I don't think

04:36.885 --> 04:40.497
we'd want to waste time
looking for bullets. Do you?

04:40.541 --> 04:42.194
This is a nice street.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.806
Nothing bad is going
to happen to us.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.895
You never know.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.207
So...

04:55.251 --> 04:56.774
what do you think?

04:56.818 --> 04:58.689
You were right
to bring us here.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.561
So many possibilities.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.040
Yes, the floor plan's good,

05:02.084 --> 05:04.042
but really,
the color of the walls...

05:04.086 --> 05:06.044
Before we go any
further, state law

05:06.088 --> 05:08.917
compels me to disclose
that a murder took place here.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.701
Someone was murdered
in this house?

05:10.745 --> 05:12.137
Was it the decorator?

05:12.181 --> 05:13.661
Oh.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.533
Simone!

05:16.577 --> 05:18.927
Naomi!

05:18.970 --> 05:21.451
I saw your car out front.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.714
Tell me that you are
buying this place.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.760
I live a block away.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.370
We would be neighbors.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.634
Karl, this is my friend
Naomi from the country club.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.723
You must be
the dashing new boyfriend

05:32.767 --> 05:34.203
I keep hearing about.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.596
Not justthe boyfriend.

05:35.639 --> 05:38.468
I've, uh, been promoted.Stop.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.470
You're engaged?

05:40.514 --> 05:42.994
Oh, well, now you definitely
need a bigger house.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.649
And who's this charming
young man?Tommy.

05:45.693 --> 05:50.393
This is my son Tommy.

05:50.437 --> 05:54.484
Tommy, this is Simone.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.704
You're pretty.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.096
Oh.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.663
Kids say the
cutest things.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.274
Oh, hands off, young man.
She's spoken for.

06:02.318 --> 06:05.277
Oh, Simone, please tell me
you'll take the house.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.716
I'd absolutely kill
to have you here.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.413
Oh, it would be fun,
wouldn't it?

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
Being close to my best friend.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.865
Simone!

06:39.181 --> 06:40.835
Are you all right?

06:40.878 --> 06:42.445
Oh, my God.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.273
What happened?

06:45.883 --> 06:47.842
My mother tried
to kill you.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.844
What?

06:49.887 --> 06:52.237
Oh, my God, is she alive?

06:53.848 --> 06:55.850
Tommy.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.896
Someone call a doctor!

06:58.940 --> 07:00.855
Okay.And the police!

07:13.433 --> 07:16.087
So... what do you think?

07:17.872 --> 07:21.092
I mean... I love it.
I say, let's do it.

07:21.136 --> 07:24.095
What?I want to buy this house.

07:24.139 --> 07:27.708
Can I talk with my husband for
a moment in private, please?

07:27.751 --> 07:30.450
Take your time.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.887
What?

07:32.930 --> 07:34.497
Dude, are you crazy?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.717
Are you cra...? Did
you not see that pool?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.370
And that kitchen is huge.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.764
Yeah, and it needs a complete
remodel. We can't afford that.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.200
D-Don't worry about
the money, all right?

07:42.244 --> 07:44.159
My career is taking off.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.291
The reviews for Jenny from
Yesterdayare through the roof.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.642
Yeah, I know,
but even so, it's still risky.

07:48.685 --> 07:51.514
Risky? Are you hearing
yourself right now?

07:51.558 --> 07:53.516
Do you know who
you sound like?Who?

07:53.560 --> 07:56.040
Me... when we were talking
about having an open marriage?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.477
Okay, that's not
the same thing.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.348
No. I was...
I was nervous.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.219
I was unsure that we could make
it work, but you convinced me.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.961
And now our life is so
much more exciting for it.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.486
Now think about how much even
more exciting our life would be

08:06.529 --> 08:08.705
with that fucking
kitchen, right?

08:08.749 --> 08:10.751
Oh, sweetie,
you still have that cold?

08:10.794 --> 08:12.492
It's fine. I'm good. I'm good.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.450
Just, Taylor, trust me.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.147
Okay? Believe in me.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.107
I promise you
I will not let you down.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.457
Take it slow.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.068
God, everything hurts.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.722
Well, here's something
to ease the pain.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.333
I went by the house.
All of Jade's stuff is gone.

08:28.377 --> 08:31.075
That was fast.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.513
Yeah. Well, she knows
we're onto her.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.211
She can't just stick around,
waiting for the cops to show up.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.257
Oh, speaking of the house,

08:39.301 --> 08:41.695
I, uh, got you
a little something.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.218
A business card?

08:43.261 --> 08:45.786
Yeah. For Lamar's Realtor.

08:45.829 --> 08:48.397
If it's okay with you,
I want to sell the house.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.834
Really?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.488
Yeah, it just
feels like

08:52.532 --> 08:54.185
every wrong turn
we've made can be traced back

08:54.229 --> 08:56.057
to the moment where I talked you
into buying it.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.580
No house--
wouldn't have

08:57.624 --> 08:59.887
met Jade. No Jade, no relapse.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.325
I mean, we'd lose
a lot of stress.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.935
The mortgage payments alone.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.853
Look at that smile.

09:09.897 --> 09:13.030
All right. So how much
downsizing are we up for?

09:13.074 --> 09:15.859
Townhouse? Condo?

09:15.903 --> 09:18.253
Fuck it. Let's just buy a field.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.820
We can pitch a tent.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.604
Love it.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.432
Tent in a field.
We'd be living the dream.

09:23.475 --> 09:27.218
And the best part about moving--
Jade won't be able to find us.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.525
Where do you think she went?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.353
I don't know.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.921
Let's just hope she's
a thousand miles away by now.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.143
Who's Duke?

09:39.187 --> 09:41.363
My grandfather.

09:41.406 --> 09:44.932
Grammy Sue gave that to him for
their first wedding anniversary.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.108
He wore it every day,
but he never wound it.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.718
He always used
to say that

09:48.762 --> 09:53.549
"When I met my Susie, it
was like time stood still."

09:53.593 --> 09:56.073
Sweet.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.119
Give you 35.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.076
Hundred?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.861
No. Dollars.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.037
It's worth much more than that.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.473
Sentimental-wise, maybe.

10:04.516 --> 10:07.476
Cash-wise, it's worth $35.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.652
Well, I need more.All right.

10:09.696 --> 10:13.264
I'll throw in
an extra five for the story.

10:13.308 --> 10:16.485
And 'cause I like your... face.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.407
How about a grand?

10:25.450 --> 10:26.843
I don't like
your face that much.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.149
Okay, well, then
a couple hundred.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.933
Honey, I told you...Please.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.240
You don't understand
what I've been through lately.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.459
I've lost everything,
and I just need a little...

10:34.503 --> 10:37.027
What you need is to give
the waterworks a rest.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.986
I made you my offer,
so either take it

10:39.029 --> 10:41.031
or get the hell out.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.261
The fuck?!
I'm calling the cops!

10:54.479 --> 10:56.917
Yeah, I get that a lot.

11:15.979 --> 11:17.502
Beth Ann.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.766
Morning, Mary.
I hope I'm not interrupting?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.768
No, not at all. Ralph
just left for work.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.465
I know. I waited for him to go.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.945
I need to speak
to you privately.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.121
What's going on?I've thought of a way

11:27.164 --> 11:29.210
to solve our respective
marital difficulties.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.082
You have?

11:32.126 --> 11:34.911
I've come up with a plan
on how to kill our husbands.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.959
Please invite me in.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.396
This is the sort of thing
we should discuss over coffee.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.410
That's the plan.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.412
Any thoughts?

11:57.455 --> 11:59.022
It's crazy.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.329
We'd never get
away with it.
But we would.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.244
Think about it.
Technically speaking,

12:03.287 --> 12:05.376
we wouldn't be doing
anything illegal.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.204
How could we be sure
that Rob and Ralph

12:07.248 --> 12:08.379
would even swallow the bait?

12:08.423 --> 12:10.033
That's the beauty of the plan.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.469
It's tailor-made to fit

12:11.513 --> 12:13.950
their horribly predictable
personalities.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.955
What if someone discovers
what we've done?

12:18.999 --> 12:21.218
I don't plan
on telling anyone.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.393
Do you?

12:22.437 --> 12:23.394
I don't know.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.396
Ralph deserves to die.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.183
And... after everything
Rob's put you through,

12:29.226 --> 12:31.794
he's just as bad.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.883
But the Bible says,

12:33.927 --> 12:36.233
"Thou shalt not kill."

12:37.234 --> 12:39.193
God might not understand.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.760
Maybe not.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.849
But I'm sure God's wife will.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.461
Now, what do you say?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.509
Oh. Tommy.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.511
You seem surprised to see me.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.949
Well, we're
such social pariahs these days,

12:55.992 --> 12:58.125
I'm surprised to see anyone.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.301
At this point,
I'd roll out the red carpet

13:00.344 --> 13:01.781
for a Jehovah's Witness.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.392
How are you feeling?

13:04.435 --> 13:05.697
Delightful.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.178
Simone's
in the kitchen.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.197
How is your mother's
physical therapy going?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.198
Better.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.287
She took
a few steps today.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.812
I still think that you
should have pressed charges.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.205
She said she lost control
of the car.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.817
I choose to believe her.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.079
Nobody else does.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.689
All of her friends
at the country club,

13:40.732 --> 13:42.865
the ones that she turned
against you and Karl,

13:42.909 --> 13:45.781
they finally found out Mom's
crazy and they dropped her.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.391
Oh. Poor Naomi.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.784
"Poor Naomi"?

13:48.828 --> 13:49.959
Come on.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.656
You must be a little pleased.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.093
The woman I'm trying to become

13:53.136 --> 13:56.183
would draw no satisfaction
from this at all.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.142
Fortunately,
I'm not that woman just yet.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.016
I'm thinking about canceling
my trip to Paris.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.801
You can't let your mother
guilt you into staying.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.283
I'd be staying
for you, not her.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
Karl's getting worse, isn't he?

14:11.328 --> 14:12.895
I'll take good care of him.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.202
But who will take care of you?

14:15.245 --> 14:16.203
I'll be fine.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.465
Oh, you should go.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.423
Karl has a doctor's appointment.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.993
I'm sorry our relationship
caused such a scandal.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.082
I try to tell people
I'm the one who pursued you,

14:26.126 --> 14:28.911
but they refuse to believe
it was my fault.

14:28.955 --> 14:32.654
You say that like we did
something we should regret.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.309
I don't regret
one moment we shared.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.617
Now go.

14:39.661 --> 14:42.142
Have the most wonderful summer
of your life.

14:42.185 --> 14:44.796
Study art.
Drink wine.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.798
Think of me every now and then.

14:46.842 --> 14:50.280
I'll think of you constantly.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.717
I love you.

14:52.761 --> 14:56.460
I won't be the last woman
you say that to.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.855
But I'm proud to be the first.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.028
Here it is.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.204
COLE:
Now, you're sure you
want to part with this?

15:44.247 --> 15:45.379
Oh, I'd love to keep it,

15:45.422 --> 15:47.250
but the truth is,
we need the money.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.340
Simone, are things really as bad
as all that?

15:50.384 --> 15:53.343
Once the art gallery went under,
we lost our health insurance.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.607
And Karl's medical bills
have been outrageous.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.261
Is there anything I can do?

15:58.305 --> 16:00.263
You could buy another painting.

16:00.307 --> 16:03.136
Perhaps you'd like to have me
hanging in your living room?

16:05.921 --> 16:08.315
Ah...

16:08.358 --> 16:11.753
Why don't I just pay you
another thousand for this one?

16:11.796 --> 16:13.146
That's very kind.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.799
And somewhat insulting.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.585
Take care, Cole.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.458
KARL:
Simone?

16:21.502 --> 16:22.982
Yes, Karl?

16:23.025 --> 16:25.288
I need you.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.380
Is everything okay?

16:30.424 --> 16:32.904
Yes, I'm just trying
to make myself presentable.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.515
Would you do my neck?

16:34.558 --> 16:37.083
Oh, of course.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.606
Are you going somewhere?

16:38.649 --> 16:41.348
Tim from my support group's
just got out of hospital.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.741
Harold's holding a
brunch in his honor.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.613
Oh, that should be nice.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.484
You haven't tasted
his cooking.

16:47.528 --> 16:50.705
I'm sure we'll all be back in
the emergency room by dessert.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.837
You are such a bitch.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.709
I should hope so.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.320
I did study with a master.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.148
Oh, I heard the doorbell.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.367
Who was it?

17:00.410 --> 17:02.064
Cole stopped by to
pick up the painting.

17:02.108 --> 17:05.067
Oh, Lord,
I feel so dreadful about that.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.765
I-I know how much
you love that piece.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.071
It's okay.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.768
At least
we can pay the mortgage now.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.510
Or most of it.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.731
I am s-- I am so sorry.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.254
Stop it.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.083
We are fine.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.521
Uh, you are right.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.176
We are, uh, two...

17:27.220 --> 17:28.743
bitch goddesses.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.050
And we will
not be defeated.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.226
Now turn.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.995
What did I tell
all you this morning

18:04.039 --> 18:05.040
before we left the house?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.216
Huh?
What did I say?

18:07.260 --> 18:09.131
Not to embarrass you.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.265
I can never go back
to that store ever again

18:12.308 --> 18:14.049
because of what
you little freaks did

18:14.093 --> 18:15.311
to that poor mannequin.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.708
Go inside.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.711
Now!

18:27.106 --> 18:28.455
Hello.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.370
I'm not sure
if you remember who I am.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.546
I know who you are.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.375
Can you tell me who youare?

18:35.418 --> 18:38.204
Let's start with the headline,
hon.

18:38.247 --> 18:41.120
I'm not Rob Stanton's wife.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.385
Come on in.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.823
I think it's time
someone told you the truth.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.180
Thank you, Lamar.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.400
Your support
means a lot.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.619
Yeah. Yeah.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.839
I will see you
on the other side, man.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.102
Okay. Bye.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.236
So, how you
gonna stay busy

19:10.279 --> 19:12.325
while I'm at rehab?

19:12.368 --> 19:15.763
Guessing the short answer
is "girls, girls, girls"?

19:16.894 --> 19:19.462
Well, funny you
should mention that.

19:19.506 --> 19:23.379
I thought maybe we could rethink
the whole open marriage thing.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.642
Really?Yeah.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.253
You know, we should
focus on us for a while.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.254
Go to therapy.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.342
And three's a crowd.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.257
Especially
in couples counseling.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.215
Okay.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.869
What, you don't like that idea?No.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.044
It's just...

19:36.087 --> 19:37.437
I mean, obviously,

19:37.480 --> 19:39.265
your sexuality
is really important.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.354
And...
I just don't want you to have

19:41.397 --> 19:42.964
to give any part of that up.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.619
It is important to me.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.968
But like I've always said,

19:47.011 --> 19:48.839
my love story is with you.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.668
And I would
choose you over

19:51.712 --> 19:54.280
a few casual hookups
any day of the week.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.109
It would just be
you and me?

19:58.153 --> 20:00.199
Forsaking all others?

20:00.242 --> 20:02.331
Till death do us part.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.250
Did we just become
Republicans?

20:08.294 --> 20:10.252
I think we did.

20:12.776 --> 20:13.951
Hector, hi.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.301
Come on in.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.174
Karl is taking a nap.
Should I wake him?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.915
Uh, no.
Actually, uh,

20:20.958 --> 20:22.482
I'm here to see you.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.962
Oh. What's going on?

20:25.006 --> 20:26.573
Remember last Sunday,
when I took Karl

20:26.616 --> 20:27.748
to that brunch at Harold's?

20:27.791 --> 20:29.750
Yes.
Thank you for driving him.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.100
So, Harold
called me today.

20:32.143 --> 20:35.277
He thinks Karl stole some pills
from his medicine cabinet.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.844
What kind of pills?

20:36.887 --> 20:38.193
Sleeping pills.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.021
And the same thing
happened two weeks ago

20:40.064 --> 20:42.241
when we went
to Billy's for bridge.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.335
I see.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.815
Karl puts on a brave face,

20:51.859 --> 20:54.601
but I know
how depressed he's been.

20:55.602 --> 20:58.300
And I'm just so worried.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.128
You did the right thing
telling me.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.305
Simone, I'm so sorry
to dump this on you.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.874
But you've always been the only
one who can get through to him.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.965
I will take care of it.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.839
Thank you.

21:15.883 --> 21:19.278
So, while you copy the
letter in your handwriting,

21:19.321 --> 21:22.019
I'll be upstairs
cleaning out your closet.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.631
You said Ralph gets
home around 6:45?

21:24.674 --> 21:26.633
Sometimes as early as 6:30.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.810
Rob gets home around 6:15,
and it's almost 5:00.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.378
We need to
get cracking.

21:32.421 --> 21:33.814
Beth Ann?

21:35.642 --> 21:38.384
When Ralph reads this...

21:38.427 --> 21:40.908
he will absolutely get violent.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.345
We can only hope.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.585
I'm going to the farmers market.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.021
Wearing that?

22:51.065 --> 22:52.675
Well, just because
I have to shop with the frumps

22:52.719 --> 22:54.547
doesn't mean I have
to dress like them.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.852
Can I get you anything?

22:55.896 --> 22:59.726
Oh, yes, actually,
um, I could use

22:59.769 --> 23:01.771
a hundred sleeping pills
to replace the ones

23:01.815 --> 23:03.686
you took out of my dresser.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.688
You noticed.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.168
That was fast.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.126
Yes, last year you
were angry with me

23:09.170 --> 23:11.390
because I didn't take
enough pills to kill myself,

23:11.433 --> 23:13.435
and now you won't
let me have any.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.177
You need to choose a policy
and stick to it, my girl.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.789
We have to fight this disease.
We can't give into it.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.052
Have you really forgotten
how bad my last bout

23:22.096 --> 23:23.663
of pneumonia was?

23:23.706 --> 23:27.188
I wasn't sure I was
leaving the hospital.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.711
But you did,
and now you're fine.

23:28.755 --> 23:32.498
Darling, I'm not fine.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.023
If my T cells were people,

23:36.066 --> 23:37.590
I couldn't get up a bridge game,

23:37.633 --> 23:41.942
so please, please
give me the pills back.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.162
I already washed them
down the sink.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.381
Well, then, you'll just force me

23:46.425 --> 23:47.948
to do something more gruesome.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.820
So, hang myself
or blow my brains out.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.126
You choose.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.563
So help me, if you do
anything disfiguring,

23:54.607 --> 23:56.347
I will give you an
open-casket funeral

23:56.391 --> 23:59.046
with no makeup and
fluorescent lighting.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.789
Dear God,

24:02.832 --> 24:05.966
I married the devil herself.

24:08.272 --> 24:12.320
Oh, I know we won't be
together always,

24:12.363 --> 24:16.019
but why subtract even a day
we could share?

24:20.850 --> 24:24.332
Fine. Fine.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.638
You win.

24:29.032 --> 24:32.035
Actually, um, I'm going
to a birthday party

24:32.079 --> 24:33.167
this afternoon.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.255
Maybe you'd like to join me.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.735
It's for Jimmy Loftus.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.737
Oh, I'd love to see him again.
He's always a hoot.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.173
How is he doing?

24:39.216 --> 24:40.957
Well, I'm afraid he's
had a bit of a setback.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.219
He's in the hospital.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.917
Oh, no.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.353
Yes, the party's
in his room.

24:45.396 --> 24:48.748
If you come, I'm sure it
would lift his spirits.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.098
Oh, I'd love to come.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.493
I'm so glad.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.761
ELI:
Oh, thank God.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.547
All right.Honey...

25:05.591 --> 25:08.289
Come here, you.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.290
Mmm.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.683
Ow. Ooh, my ribs.
Oh.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.032
Oh, I'm sorry.No, no. No, no.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.729
Don't stop, don't stop.
I can take it.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.134
I thought you said Jade
took the dog when she left.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.049
She did.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.666
Hey.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.886
Hey.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.758
What are you doing here?I'm making dinner.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.673
Oh.

25:44.717 --> 25:48.198
Okay.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.113
I think you need to leave.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.681
I know things got a little funky
for a minute there,

25:52.725 --> 25:54.291
but there's no reason
that we can't go back

25:54.335 --> 25:55.684
to the way we were before.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.512
Oh, I think there are
a lot of reasons.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.601
Yeah, Jade, please...Her name's not Jade.

25:59.645 --> 26:00.994
Who cares?

26:01.037 --> 26:02.865
Am I not allowed
to reinvent myself?

26:02.909 --> 26:03.953
I mean, fuck.

26:05.825 --> 26:09.306
Okay, you know what,
let's just all settle down.

26:09.350 --> 26:12.614
You guys act like
everything that happened

26:12.658 --> 26:14.311
is my fault; it's not.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.617
I could have gone
to Europe,

26:15.661 --> 26:17.619
but you begged me
to stay.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.708
You pretended to love me,

26:19.752 --> 26:24.495
and you promised that you would
always take care of me.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.976
It's not fair.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.588
You're right.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.720
You're right,
it's not fair.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.244
Okay, just stop.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.333
I don't believe
one thing about you.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.509
Least of all your tears.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.337
I didn't pretend
to love you, I did.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.513
But that's because I didn't know
who you really are.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.167
You tried to trick us.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.300
You played us, and you lost.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.736
It's done.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.346
Now get out.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.874
I'll go...

26:54.917 --> 26:56.571
but you have to pay me first.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.660
You think you can shake us down?

26:58.704 --> 26:59.748
Honey.It costs money

26:59.792 --> 27:01.184
to start over.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.664
We're not aiding
and abetting a criminal.

27:02.708 --> 27:03.926
You owe me.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.668
Eli sold our script
for a million dollars.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.452
Give me ten grand, and I'll go.

27:08.496 --> 27:11.891
I'm not gonna pay you to leave.
I'm just gonna call the cops.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.897
All right, you know what,
let's just hold on a second.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.681
Okay? You know what
I'm gonna do?

27:19.725 --> 27:21.378
I'm gonna go talk to her.
We're gonna work this out.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.902
I mean, after all,
you've been through a lot,

27:22.945 --> 27:24.338
but you're not a bad person.

27:24.381 --> 27:25.687
Right? No, no, okay.

27:25.731 --> 27:26.906
How could you leave me alone

27:26.949 --> 27:27.907
with that psychopath?

27:27.950 --> 27:29.386
I can't find my fucking phone.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.388
Where is it?

27:33.173 --> 27:34.478
Smoke alarm.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.351
She's burning down
the goddamn house.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.971
Hey.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.281
So what, exactly,
is Jimmy's prognosis?

27:54.324 --> 27:56.239
Well, whatever it is,
this is a party,

27:56.283 --> 27:57.719
so please try to smile.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.461
Darling, I can smile
through anything.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.335
Karl, Simone, you made it.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.686
Hello, hello.
Oh, let us through,

28:07.729 --> 28:08.991
we want to see
the birthday boy.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.478
KEN:
Jimmy, look who's here.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.784
It's Karl and Simone.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.742
Happy birthday, Jimmy.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.092
And you should see
what Simone is wearing.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.528
I think it's Lagerfeld.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.574
Uh, Karl, Simone,

28:26.617 --> 28:29.577
I wanted you to meet Jimmy's mom
and his sister Terry.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.579
They just got in
from Iowa.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.494
It is so lovely
to meet you both.

28:33.537 --> 28:34.669
I can't tell you how
comforting it's been

28:34.713 --> 28:36.366
to find Jimmy here
surrounded by

28:36.410 --> 28:38.107
such loving friends.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.674
KEN:
Oh, you ain't seen
nothing yet, honey.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.763
I made my famous
carrot cake.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.591
You are having
a piece, Mr. Jim,

28:43.634 --> 28:47.595
even if they have to puree it
and drip it into your arm.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.990
Can he hear us?

28:51.033 --> 28:52.731
Of course he can.

28:52.774 --> 28:56.169
Everyone's here now.
Time to sing.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.780
Here we go.

28:58.824 --> 29:02.828
♪ Happy birthday to you

29:02.871 --> 29:06.745
♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪

29:06.788 --> 29:11.097
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jimmy

29:11.140 --> 29:12.620
Excuse me.

29:12.663 --> 29:17.625
♪ Happy birthday to you.

29:39.603 --> 29:43.869
I don't understand how
he got so sick so quickly.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.262
This is the disease.

29:47.916 --> 29:51.354
I've watched it happen
to Clive, to Harry,

29:51.398 --> 29:53.487
to Alistair...

29:53.530 --> 29:56.403
It's just horrifying.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.319
You know, Jimmy
once told me

29:59.362 --> 30:01.800
he was scared of
ending up like this.

30:03.149 --> 30:07.196
Connected to tubes,
wasting away.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.812
But here he is.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.424
You know what
I'm driving at.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.165
You're not that sick.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.167
Yet.

30:23.647 --> 30:26.215
But we've seen my future.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.004
I would rather choose life,

30:32.047 --> 30:36.051
but life is...

30:37.226 --> 30:39.228
...off the table.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.145
The only thing
I can choose

30:43.189 --> 30:47.019
is when to die and...

30:47.062 --> 30:49.456
how.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.154
I brought you here today

30:52.198 --> 30:54.722
because I needed
you to understand.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.727
Do you?

31:11.913 --> 31:14.350
Thank you.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.713
Rob.

31:29.757 --> 31:30.714
You're home.

31:30.758 --> 31:33.979
And starving.
Is dinner ready?

31:34.022 --> 31:35.763
The day got away from me.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.244
I had to order Chinese takeout.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.507
But it's Thursday.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.813
I was looking forward
to meatloaf.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.773
If it helps, I made you
a shaker of martinis.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.906
You could have a few
while we wait.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.299
Now you're talkin'.

31:50.343 --> 31:53.172
Thanks.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.144
Hi.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.667
Are you Taylor Harding?

32:10.711 --> 32:13.453
Yeah. Wow, you got here fast.
Come on in.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.542
Eli, the police are here.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.413
Already?

32:18.806 --> 32:21.243
I'm sorry, were you
expecting us?

32:21.287 --> 32:23.245
Yeah, we reported
a break-in.

32:23.289 --> 32:24.464
That was, like,
ten minutes ago.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.640
We're not here about
any break-in.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.164
We came to talk about
Duke Riley.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.384
What about Duke?

32:31.427 --> 32:32.733
You filed a police report
six weeks ago

32:32.776 --> 32:34.039
accusing him of assault.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.476
Yes.
And then four days ago,

32:36.519 --> 32:37.651
you posted his bail.

32:37.694 --> 32:40.001
I did. Why are you asking?

32:40.045 --> 32:41.611
Duke Riley was murdered
yesterday.

32:41.655 --> 32:44.658
His landlord found his body
in his apartment.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.269
He had been repeatedly stabbed.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.925
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

32:52.492 --> 32:55.147
I think we do.

32:58.150 --> 33:01.631
Whoa, this'll be
my third one.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.416
Oh, who's counting?

33:05.635 --> 33:08.203
Mrs. Stanton, are you trying
to get me drunk?

33:08.247 --> 33:11.032
I just wanted you
to be relaxed

33:11.076 --> 33:12.991
so we could have
a little chat.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.993
About what?

33:16.081 --> 33:18.779
About the day our daughter died.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.397
This will do it?

33:28.441 --> 33:31.922
Yes, just the one dose.

33:31.966 --> 33:36.188
And you won't feel any pain,
you'll just... sleep?

33:36.231 --> 33:38.277
So I'm told.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.541
Are you sure you don't
want Hector here?

33:41.584 --> 33:45.023
No, no. We've, um,
we've said our goodbyes.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.025
I-I mean,
he wanted to be here, but...

33:47.068 --> 33:48.809
well, he's so bloody emotional.

33:48.852 --> 33:52.160
The mere mention of my death, he
starts wailing like a car alarm.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.990
Be nice. He loves you.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.775
I know.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.908
But to be honest, uh,

34:00.951 --> 34:03.693
I just wanted it
to be the two of us.

34:03.737 --> 34:07.697
You deserve to have
more than just me.

34:07.741 --> 34:11.658
You should have a huge, glorious
party to send you off.

34:11.701 --> 34:16.489
You are a glorious party,
all by yourself.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.014
I knew that the first moment

34:20.058 --> 34:22.408
I laid eyes on you.

34:26.803 --> 34:30.677
You'll always be
the love of my life.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.813
So, what happens now?

34:36.857 --> 34:39.816
Well, uh, firstly, I...

34:39.860 --> 34:42.515
I'd like you to change
into the red gown

34:42.558 --> 34:44.517
I bought you in Venice.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.910
What's wrong with this one?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.478
I prefer the red.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.481
All right.

34:52.525 --> 34:56.920
But this is the last time
I'll let you edit my wardrobe.

34:56.964 --> 35:00.881
When you've changed,
come down to the living room.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.926
I have a nice surprise for you.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.410
I don't want
to talk about Emily.

35:08.454 --> 35:12.197
Well, I do. I've been thinking
about that day a lot lately.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.894
And I've remembered something.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.287
What's that?

35:15.330 --> 35:18.725
I absolutely locked the gate

35:18.768 --> 35:21.075
after I brought in
the trash can.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.208
Huh.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.427
Well, you must not have.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.213
How else did Emily
get out into the street?

35:28.256 --> 35:32.304
Perhaps you could come up
with another explanation.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.001
Think.

35:37.439 --> 35:38.875
I'm not feeling well.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.183
My darling.

35:42.227 --> 35:47.623
You can't possibly imagine how
important this moment is to me.

35:47.667 --> 35:50.757
Please.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.804
Did anything happen that day
you haven't told me?

36:07.687 --> 36:10.820
No.

36:13.301 --> 36:14.955
Thank you.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.044
For what?

36:17.087 --> 36:20.917
You've made this all
so much easier.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.919
Well, she's obviously dangerous.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.660
You might want to think
about staying someplace

36:24.704 --> 36:26.401
for a few days
until we locate her.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.316
We'll check into
a hotel tonight.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.014
FEMALE DETECTIVE:
And we'll put a car on the
street outside until you leave.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.625
Don't worry.
She won't get past us.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.409
Good night.TAYLOR:
Night.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.761
Okay, I was trying to be cool
in front of the detectives,

36:38.805 --> 36:40.720
but oh, my God,
Jade killed Duke.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.722
I know. I know.Wait, do you think she's
actually gonna come back here?

36:42.765 --> 36:44.680
TAYLOR:
We can't stick around long
enough to find out.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.508
What about the dog?We'll take it with us.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.597
You feed her first,
I'll go start packing.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.120
Okay. All right.
Come on, Teacup.Okay.

37:13.318 --> 37:16.408
Mary, I'm home.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.499
Bring me a beer!

37:20.542 --> 37:23.241
And I want it
in a mug this time.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.640
Mary?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.949
Mary?

37:42.956 --> 37:46.481
MARY:
Dearest Ralph. I haven't been
happy for quite some time.

37:46.525 --> 37:49.092
But that's not why
I've decided to leave you.

37:49.136 --> 37:52.922
I've met someone else.
A man who makes me happy.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.316
So I'm leaving you
for Rob Stanton.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.840
He loves me in a way
you never could.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.278
Your ex-wife, Mary.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.723
: Shit.

38:51.894 --> 38:54.419
Aren't you gonna get that?

38:54.462 --> 38:56.856
Must have been a wrong number.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.121
Well, when's the Chinese food
getting here? I'm hungry.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.776
I'm sure it'll arrive
any second.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.127
See?

39:08.389 --> 39:10.173
Wait.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.915
Are you sure that's the delivery
guy? He sounds angry.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.832
Who else could it be?

39:29.802 --> 39:32.065
You are so beautiful.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.372
Look who's talking.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.507
Are you ready?

39:41.944 --> 39:45.383
Not just yet.

39:45.426 --> 39:46.862
Have you changed your mind?

39:46.906 --> 39:49.082
No. No.

39:49.125 --> 39:53.739
But I would love
just one more dance.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.959
A tango?

39:57.003 --> 39:58.961
What else?

40:01.442 --> 40:03.096
ELI:
Babe, what
should I pack?

40:03.139 --> 40:05.228
Just the essentials.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.495
How is this essential?

40:10.538 --> 40:11.583
Look, just 'cause
we're going into hiding

40:11.626 --> 40:12.627
doesn't mean we can't look good.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.063
Hey, have you seen my laptop?

40:14.107 --> 40:15.848
I think it's downstairs.
Check the dining room table.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.415
Okay, I'll be right back.All right.

40:17.458 --> 40:18.807
So it's true.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.461
What are you doing here?

40:20.505 --> 40:22.637
I won't be here long.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.030
I just want to know why.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.162
Now is not a good time.
You have to go.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.512
What the hell?

40:27.555 --> 40:28.513
I'm sorry, Rob.

40:28.556 --> 40:32.299
Uh... honey, this is...

40:32.342 --> 40:34.475
Don't bother lying. She knows
that we were having an affair.

40:34.519 --> 40:35.955
What?BETH ANN:
Please.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.087
You have to go!You know how
I always talk to you

40:38.131 --> 40:39.741
about my friend Sheila?

40:39.785 --> 40:41.003
This is Sheila.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.574
Uh, okay...

40:46.618 --> 40:50.186
I came to the diner that day
to confront you.

40:50.230 --> 40:53.407
But you were so nice. And you
said we could be friends.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.582
Hold on.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.279
You're friends with my mistress?

40:56.323 --> 40:57.585
Fiancée.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.239
Can we talk about this later?

40:59.282 --> 41:00.501
What could you have
been thinking?

41:00.545 --> 41:02.547
Oh, you're a fine one to talk.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.462
You've been having
an affair for months.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.115
You've been planning
on leaving me.

41:06.159 --> 41:08.596
Oh, my God.
Do you even have cancer?

41:08.640 --> 41:10.816
Cancer? You have cancer?

41:12.078 --> 41:13.558
Well, this is just awkward.

48:40.091 --> 48:41.353
Hi there.

48:41.396 --> 48:43.137
You must be Beth Ann?

48:43.181 --> 48:44.834
You must be Simone.
Come in.

48:44.878 --> 48:47.968
It's nice to finally meet you.Likewise.

48:48.012 --> 48:50.101
I have the keys
around here somewhere.

48:50.144 --> 48:51.972
Let me look.

48:52.016 --> 48:53.800
One of the reasons
I wanted to meet

48:53.843 --> 48:55.976
was because I had a question.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.369
It's a bit awkward.

48:57.412 --> 48:58.979
What would you like to know?

48:59.023 --> 49:00.372
The realtor told me

49:00.415 --> 49:02.809
that someone was murdered
in this house?

49:02.852 --> 49:04.811
It's true.
My husband was killed...

49:04.854 --> 49:05.986
right where you're standing.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.988
Oh, dear.Our neighbor broke in

49:08.032 --> 49:09.729
and accused Rob of
sleeping with his wife.

49:09.772 --> 49:11.252
Shot him dead.

49:11.296 --> 49:13.385
He was executed last year.
So sad.

49:15.082 --> 49:17.215
Aunt Beth, I'm packed.
Can we go?

49:17.258 --> 49:19.260
In a sec.
Elsie, this is Simone,

49:19.304 --> 49:21.262
the woman who bought our house.Hi, there.

49:21.306 --> 49:23.656
You're so pretty.
She's your niece?

49:23.699 --> 49:26.093
The daughter of my friend,
April Warner.

49:26.137 --> 49:28.617
But I've been helping take care
of her since she was a baby.

49:28.661 --> 49:30.445
April is a singer, you know.

49:30.489 --> 49:32.012
My mom's gonna be on Broadway.

49:32.056 --> 49:34.101
That's why we sold the house.
We're moving to New York.

49:34.145 --> 49:35.407
Oh, how exciting.

49:35.450 --> 49:36.886
Here are your keys.

49:36.930 --> 49:40.934
I hope to have a very
happy life in this house.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.023
A happy life
isn't hard to come by.

49:43.067 --> 49:46.592
The trick is
to not regret the choices

49:46.635 --> 49:49.377
you made along the way.

49:49.421 --> 49:51.292
Yes.

49:51.336 --> 49:53.294
Well...

49:53.338 --> 49:55.166
good luck with everything.

49:55.209 --> 49:57.690
Likewise.
Take care of my house.

49:58.952 --> 50:00.867
I'll give it lots of love.

50:02.782 --> 50:04.175
There you go.

50:04.218 --> 50:07.047
Thank you.

50:07.091 --> 50:08.875
I just know that we're
gonna love living here.

50:08.918 --> 50:10.529
I certainly hope so.

50:10.572 --> 50:12.444
So when did you
buy the house?

50:12.487 --> 50:14.098
'74.

50:14.141 --> 50:16.970
But after my husband died,
I rented the house out.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.756
Then it was the headquarters
for my foundation.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.020
I raise money for AIDS research.

50:23.063 --> 50:24.369
Yeah, we've read up on you.

50:24.412 --> 50:25.979
You've done such
amazing work.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.547
I ended up living
a very rich life,

50:28.590 --> 50:30.679
once I stopped worrying
about money.

50:32.246 --> 50:34.205
Paulo, I'm ready.

50:35.728 --> 50:37.208
Is that a Thomas J. Harte?

50:37.251 --> 50:40.211
Oh, you know his work?TAYLOR: Sure.

50:40.254 --> 50:42.517
Yeah, we saw a show of his
at the Whitney last year.That's right, yeah.

50:42.561 --> 50:45.694
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

50:45.738 --> 50:47.827
I always hoped Tommy
would go far.

50:47.870 --> 50:51.526
Tommy?
Is he a friend of yours?

50:51.570 --> 50:55.617
A friend?
You could say that.

50:55.661 --> 50:58.794
My face is tattooed on his ass.

51:00.796 --> 51:03.364
Paulo, push.

51:07.934 --> 51:10.980
Well, it's been
lovely to meet you, Taylor.

51:11.024 --> 51:12.678
And just know that
Andrew and I will

51:12.721 --> 51:14.723
take wonderful care
of your home.

51:14.767 --> 51:17.074
Aw, well, I hope
you'll enjoy it.

51:17.117 --> 51:19.119
We will.

51:19.163 --> 51:23.036
And I'm sorry for everything
that happened to you here.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.734
Can't imagine what
you went through.

51:25.778 --> 51:27.910
It was an awful night.

51:27.954 --> 51:29.390
But it could have been worse.

51:29.434 --> 51:31.784
So you really have
a rifle collection?

51:31.827 --> 51:34.134
Yeah. They're all
in that box over there.

51:34.178 --> 51:36.702
Hey, check this out.

51:36.745 --> 51:39.705
This is me on safari
in Africa.

51:39.748 --> 51:42.011
Look at that.
No way.

51:42.055 --> 51:44.449
Well, I-I never knew there were
Jews that were into hunting.

51:44.492 --> 51:46.842
We exist. But it's not
as cruel to the animals,

51:46.886 --> 51:48.453
because we miss so frequently.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.935
TAYLOR:
Oh, before I forget,

51:52.979 --> 51:54.415
here are your keys.

51:54.459 --> 51:57.201
Thank you.

51:57.244 --> 51:58.593
So, what about
the two of you?

51:58.637 --> 52:00.029
Found a new place to live?

52:00.073 --> 52:01.596
Uh, yeah. Well, actually...

52:01.640 --> 52:03.990
...we're moving back
to our old condo.

52:04.033 --> 52:06.906
After living in a mansion.
That is some serious downsizing.

52:06.949 --> 52:09.691
Yeah. For us, it turns out...

52:09.735 --> 52:11.780
Less is more.

52:11.824 --> 52:13.173
Well, best of luck
to both of you.

52:13.217 --> 52:15.088
Thanks.Thanks.

52:18.613 --> 52:20.137
They seem like nice people.

52:27.709 --> 52:29.537
Are you gonna miss the house?

52:29.581 --> 52:32.279
It's just a building.

52:32.323 --> 52:34.412
Home is where my family is.

52:53.648 --> 52:56.390
Back to the hotel?

52:56.434 --> 53:00.394
Yes. I'm ready
for my massage now.

53:15.279 --> 53:17.716
All right.
Condo, here we come.

53:17.759 --> 53:21.589
It's gonna be nice.
Just the three of us.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.775
Honey?
