WEBVTT

01:07.401 --> 01:08.802
Get the hell out of here!

01:21.249 --> 01:23.751
Drove a car through the front
window, smashed the glass case,

01:23.817 --> 01:25.319
grabbed as many weapons
as they could,

01:25.386 --> 01:27.788
got back in their car,
and got the hell out of there.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.657
And this poor bastard
got in the way.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.425
- Owner?
- Owner's brother.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.960
Guy named Ted Whitman.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.395
Works here part-time.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.797
- Not anymore.
- Damn.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.499
Looks like he got hit
with something pretty hard.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.067
Bat, tire iron,
that sort of thing.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.502
You contact the owner?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.036
He's waiting for you outside.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.776
Mr. Whitman,
we're very sorry for your loss.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.544
I, uh,

01:50.611 --> 01:51.845
I don't know what to say.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.748
I can't believe
this actually happened.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.084
Your brother
was working alone?

01:57.151 --> 02:01.455
Teddy was working nights
trying to make some money.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.823
He was a chef too.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.726
He was hoping to open up
a restaurant someday.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.228
Anything unusual going on?

02:07.295 --> 02:09.430
Any threats, or either
one of you owe anyone money?

02:09.497 --> 02:10.898
No, nothing like that.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.935
Everything's been going
really good until tonight.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.838
Well, look, if you think of
anything else, give us a call.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.408
And in the meantime,
we're gonna need a list

02:20.474 --> 02:22.543
of all the items
that were stolen, okay?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.712
Make, model, serial number.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.979
We're also gonna need
to access

02:26.046 --> 02:27.848
your security system.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.917
Again, we're very sorry
for your loss.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.021
We don't know much yet,
but we'll keep you in the loop.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.989
Please do.
The folks down in D.C.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.058
get real nervous
when guns are stolen.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.361
Well, we got that in common.
Folks in New York do too.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.496
Um, I'm here
if you need me, Jubal.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.764
Feel free to reach out.
- All right. Great.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.599
Appreciate it.
- How's Isobel feeling?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.901
Ah, well, not great.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.570
But she's tough.
She'll make it through.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.171
This damn COVID thing
is getting old.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.807
Ah, tell me about it.
Morning, folks.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.909
So we're chasing a murder,

02:55.976 --> 02:57.878
but we're also chasing
a cache of stolen weapons,

02:57.945 --> 02:59.580
but the question
of the moment is "why"?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.382
Why do they steal
these weapons?

03:01.449 --> 03:02.850
Kelly, ready
with that video yet?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.752
Pulling it up as we speak.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.857
Guessing that's
the murder weapon.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.725
ERT recovered the sledgehammer?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.026
No, they must have taken it
with them.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.762
Mm-hmm.
All right, let's do some math.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.397
See if we can figure out
how tall the suspects are.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.731
- Copy that.
- And we need to find

03:17.798 --> 03:20.634
the owner of that car.
- It's a 1987 Blazer.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.935
License plate is cold.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.537
Okay, I guess
we're gonna have to settle

03:23.604 --> 03:25.038
for the owner of the car
whose plates were stolen.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.812
I had no idea
my plates were missing.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.447
I haven't driven the car
in a few days.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.848
You know, COVID and all.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.186
Does this security
camera work?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.855
Yes, we had it installed
a few months ago.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.757
A neighbor down the road
had his house broken into,

03:43.824 --> 03:45.559
so we upgraded
our whole system.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.727
Okay, that's great.
We're gonna need

03:46.794 --> 03:47.961
to see the footage.
Is that okay?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.597
Of course.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.768
<i>Here are the two perps.</i>

03:54.835 --> 03:57.104
This is two nights ago,
around 7:00 p.m.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.439
Mm-hmm. All right.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.408
Let's see if we can get
a good shot of this guy.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.142
- Mm.
- Yeah, there you go.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.044
One of them
looks pretty young.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.245
He's a baby.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.748
All right,
run it through facial rec.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.417
- No hits.
- Yeah.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.820
You know what? This logo
on the hoodie looks familiar.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.022
Let's see if we can get
a better look at it.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.089
Okay, there.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.025
Looks like a lion.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.696
No, that's a cougar.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.499
It's a mascot for Chapman
Private School in Scarsdale.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.700
My son goes there.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.292
That's Clayton Hall.
He's a junior.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.794
Why? Something happened to him?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.229
We think he might be involved
in a robbery-homicide.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.868
You don't seem as surprised
as one might expect.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.870
I'm not, unfortunately.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.138
- And why is that?
- Clayton is--

05:05.205 --> 05:06.574
he has issues.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.442
Okay. What kind of issues?

05:08.509 --> 05:11.612
The art teacher notified us
last week that his drawings,

05:11.679 --> 05:15.115
his cartoons, were disturbing.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.586
A lot of violent images.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.521
Okay. Is Clayton here now?

05:20.588 --> 05:22.089
Let me check.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.660
No, he called in sick today.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.129
Okay, we're gonna need
his home address.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.942
We're definitely
in the right place.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.317
FBI! Anybody home?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.716
Don't come inside.
Just stay away.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.851
You understand me?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.285
Clayton, is that you?

06:25.352 --> 06:26.754
Yeah, it's me.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.822
But I'm not coming out
no matter what you say.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.724
All right, that's fine.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.892
But we're not gonna
go anywhere,

06:31.959 --> 06:33.427
so it is probably best
that we come

06:33.494 --> 06:36.296
to some sort of compromise.
- No compromises!

06:36.363 --> 06:39.099
That's all people
want these days is compromises.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.435
What the hell does
that even mean?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.603
You're right.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.605
Clayton, you're right.
I'm sorry.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.575
I misspoke.
I used the wrong word.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.477
What I should have said is
that we are here to help you,

06:49.543 --> 06:50.878
that we want to help you.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.846
Okay, Clayton,
does that sound better?

06:54.047 --> 06:57.317
Yeah, that sounds good.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.386
Okay, thank you.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.055
I just wanna make sure
that no one gets hurt.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.000
Clayton.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.871
Clayton!

07:22.676 --> 07:23.677
He's down.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.996
We need an ambulance

07:43.063 --> 07:45.533
to 33 Hancock Drive
in Scarsdale.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.834
Right now.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.311
Inspect that.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.316
The house is clean.
There are no guns.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.886
Okay, so he only took
the Glock

08:05.953 --> 08:08.622
that he used, and what?
Hid the other guns?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.023
Or his partner has them.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.793
Either way, we gotta find
his accomplice fast.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.929
Hey, look at this.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.677
I don't understand.
I mean, how do you--

09:03.744 --> 09:06.546
how do you go from smiling
and laughing on the beach

09:06.614 --> 09:09.516
to, I mean, all of this?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.686
Who the hell knows?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.724
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

09:16.790 --> 09:20.427
Clay's been struggling,
but he's a good kid.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.262
He just--
- We did everything we could.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.698
We tried different doctors,
different medications.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.868
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.637
Do you have any idea who
your son was with last night

09:29.703 --> 09:31.004
or the night before?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.106
No, we've been giving him
more independence,

09:33.173 --> 09:35.943
so we try not to ask
a lot of questions.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.945
It sounds really stupid now,
I get it,

09:38.011 --> 09:40.347
but the psychiatrist
thought it might help, so--

09:40.413 --> 09:42.315
We understand.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.517
Did Clay have a best friend?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.419
Someone that he liked
to hang out with?

09:46.486 --> 09:49.356
He wasn't really close
to many kids.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.258
None that we knew of.

09:51.324 --> 09:55.028
Only one he ever talked about
was Simon--Simon Branch.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.433
I haven't hung out with Clay
in a long time.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.535
Two or three months.
- Why not?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.638
I don't know, he and I just--

10:04.705 --> 10:06.239
it started to get weird.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.608
Some of the things he would
talk about were pretty serious.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.447
I hate to tell you this,
Clay is dead.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.550
He took his own life
about an hour ago.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.756
But it is extremely important

10:22.823 --> 10:26.226
that we understand
what Clay was up to.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.729
It's also important that we
know where you were last night.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.466
I was home
all night studying.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.602
And your parents
can verify this?

10:35.669 --> 10:37.671
- Yeah, definitely.
- It's good to hear.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.774
And just so you know, we're not
accusing you of anything.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.510
You understand that, right?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.445
Now, if you don't mind,

10:45.512 --> 10:46.680
we need to know
what crazy things

10:46.747 --> 10:48.115
Clay was talking about.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.853
About a month ago,

10:52.920 --> 10:54.454
he said
that it would be pretty cool

10:54.521 --> 10:55.923
to shoot up a school.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.624
I said he was nuts
and that he needed

10:57.691 --> 10:59.192
to talk to a shrink
or something.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.527
I even called his parents,

11:00.593 --> 11:01.962
and they were
pretty freaked out,

11:02.029 --> 11:05.165
but they begged me not to say
anything to anyone else.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.534
So I didn't.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.105
Who was Clay hanging out with
these past few months?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.807
Gamer dudes.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.876
You know their names?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.444
Yeah.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.080
Did you find anything
interesting in Clayton's SUV?

11:20.147 --> 11:22.215
Not really--we pulled three
different sets of prints

11:22.282 --> 11:24.017
but ran them through IAFIS,
and no hits.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.453
Uh-huh, but Tiffany sent over
that list of gamers, right?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.888
Yep, we've got 11 names.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.656
We're pulling as much info
as we can on every kid.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.358
Mm-kay, and we found
Perp One's height?

11:31.424 --> 11:32.826
Approximately 6'1".

11:32.893 --> 11:34.361
Okay, so let's use that
to narrow down the list.

11:34.427 --> 11:37.030
And yes, let's dig into
these kids' social media posts.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.632
See if we can't figure out
who Clayton's accomplice is.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.168
Look for any veiled
or cryptic references

11:41.234 --> 11:45.038
to a school shooting, yeah?
- We're all over it, boss.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.573
Sir?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.010
You got a second?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.779
Uh, sir?
What, are you gonna ask

11:51.845 --> 11:53.013
for my daughter's hand
in marriage?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.182
- No, I, uh--
- What's up?

11:55.248 --> 11:56.616
It's about the list.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.252
I didn't wanna say anything
in front of everybody,

11:59.319 --> 12:03.556
but there's a kid's name--
um, Tyler Kelton.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.427
Kelton?

12:07.494 --> 12:08.996
Yeah, I didn't--

12:09.062 --> 12:11.664
it's your wife's
maiden name, right?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.337
Yeah.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.738
Right.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.208
Right, okay, um...

12:21.274 --> 12:23.343
well, thanks for the info.
I'll look into it.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.912
- Sure.
- Okay, great.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.886
I can't believe Clay would
really do something like that.

12:34.521 --> 12:39.459
Yeah, I know, it's
a difficult thing to process.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.928
But he was also involved
in something

12:40.994 --> 12:42.762
pretty bad last night, Ty.

12:42.830 --> 12:46.499
It was a robbery and a murder.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.069
What?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.470
That's insane.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.306
Well, it was him
and another man or a student,

12:53.373 --> 12:55.175
and they robbed a gun store.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.944
Stole about 40 weapons,

12:57.010 --> 12:59.079
including four
AR Assault Rifles,

12:59.146 --> 13:03.716
and they killed an employee
in the process.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.753
So were you friends
with Clayton?

13:08.055 --> 13:11.791
We hung out sometimes,
but he was pretty weird,

13:11.859 --> 13:13.927
so I kept my distance.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.329
Do you know who else
he hung out with?

13:16.396 --> 13:17.630
You asking me to snitch?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.768
Well,
I'm trying to figure out

13:21.835 --> 13:23.370
who was with him.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.805
I don't know, like I said,
I never really talked to Clay.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.510
Okay.
But you hung out in his crowd?

13:30.577 --> 13:31.912
His crowd?
What does that even mean?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.281
I don't know, Ty.
You tell me.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.648
There's nothing to tell.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.950
I hang out
with some kids at school.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.251
Sometimes, we play video games.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.220
That doesn't make me
a bad person.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.890
Hey, no one's accusing you
of being a bad person.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.391
I'm trying to figure out
if one of your friends

13:44.457 --> 13:47.861
or acquaintances or whatever
is involved in this thing.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.796
I told you, I don't know.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.831
Look, until we figure
this thing out

13:51.899 --> 13:53.166
and we catch
Clayton's accomplice,

13:53.233 --> 13:55.235
you need to stay away
from those kids.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.703
Every single one of them.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.172
Hello? Do you hear me?
- Yes, fine.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.743
Okay.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.645
I love you, buddy.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.452
Hey, what's going on?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.686
Was Tyler here last night?

14:13.753 --> 14:14.988
Here?
What are you talking about?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.356
Yeah, was he at the house
here with you?

14:16.423 --> 14:17.724
Yes. Why?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.692
You know that robbery
last night in Scarsdale?

14:19.759 --> 14:21.328
- At the gun store?
- Yeah.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.296
Well, one of the perps
went to Chapman.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.932
Are you serious?
That's crazy.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.366
Yeah, what's even crazier

14:26.433 --> 14:28.301
is that Tyler
used to hang out with him.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.770
Played video games
or something.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.005
But I had no idea he was
hanging out

14:32.072 --> 14:35.375
in some fringe gamer crowd

14:35.442 --> 14:39.512
or using the surname Kelton
for that matter.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.780
I was going to tell you
about--

14:40.847 --> 14:42.215
Yeah, what's that about?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.353
He's...

14:46.419 --> 14:51.124
he's been pretty negative
lately about you.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.860
He said he'd feel better
using my last name.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.162
It's just a phase.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.330
Oh.
Why didn't you tell me this?

14:57.397 --> 15:00.167
Because I didn't wanna get
into a whole thing, Jubal.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.203
He's just having a hard time.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.373
I'm having a real hard time
understanding why

15:06.439 --> 15:10.210
you didn't feel it necessary
to tell me this, you know?

15:10.277 --> 15:13.280
I say something pretty much
every time we talk.

15:13.346 --> 15:17.417
Every single time,
but you just gloss over it.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.551
He'll be fine.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.887
All kids
go through an awkward stage.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.622
Kids need to fail.
It builds character.

15:22.689 --> 15:26.726
I didn't--I didn't know
it was that bad.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.362
Well, it is.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.300
Or it was.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.769
Things have been better
the past month or so.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.771
He said he'd made new friends.

15:38.838 --> 15:42.409
Fringe gamers or not,
he's happier.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.545
No, that's good. I guess.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.648
Yeah.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.883
But until we find
this other perp,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.452
who I'm guessing
goes to Chapman

15:52.519 --> 15:53.953
and hangs out in this crowd,

15:54.021 --> 15:56.123
he needs to stay away
from these kids.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.359
I told him as much,
but if you could, you know,

15:59.426 --> 16:01.694
just keep an eye on him.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.663
Of course.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.499
Okay, okay.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.301
Bye.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.937
Listen up, I just spoke
to Agent Valentine,

16:11.004 --> 16:12.939
and he's asked me to help out.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.974
The good news is,
I'm up to speed on the facts,

16:15.042 --> 16:18.078
so it's business as usual
minus Agent Valentine's

16:18.145 --> 16:20.880
irrepressible wit and charm,
of course.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.449
Okay, let's get going.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.017
Where are we
on the list of friends?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.952
Have we ID'ed anyone who fits
the physical description

16:26.019 --> 16:28.355
of perp number one?
- Not yet, sir.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.890
No need for sirs.
What about social media posts?

16:30.957 --> 16:32.692
Anything that mentions
the gun store robbery?

16:32.759 --> 16:36.096
Uh, no, sir. Sorry.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.730
Any references
to mass shooting events?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.066
Negative.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.133
The social media posts
have been pretty tame.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.701
Mostly about video games.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.103
Got something.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.305
This kid, Zach O'Connor,

16:45.372 --> 16:47.574
he's a really good match
for the body type of Perp One.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.143
We just did some quick math,
looks like he's about 6'1",

16:50.210 --> 16:51.911
and there's lots
of online interaction

16:51.978 --> 16:53.413
with Clayton Hall too.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.250
Looks good to me.
Find his home address now.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.852
No, Zach isn't here. Why?
What is going on?

16:59.919 --> 17:01.254
Your son is a person
of interest

17:01.321 --> 17:02.622
in a recent robbery-homicide.

17:02.689 --> 17:06.226
What? Zach?
No, there must be some mistake.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.295
You mind if we come inside
and take a look around?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.797
- You have a warrant?
- No, sir. We don't.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.499
But the truth is,
we are concerned

17:12.565 --> 17:14.000
about a school shooting

17:14.067 --> 17:15.435
or some other kind of mass shooting.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.539
Do you mind if we come inside
and take a look around?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.643
Yeah, okay.
Just do what you have to do.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.060
Looks like Zach is our guy.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.004
It's empty.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.806
How many of his guns
are missing?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.040
Uh...

18:29.809 --> 18:31.244
Looks like one AR Assault Rifle

18:31.311 --> 18:33.280
and two nine-millimeter
semi-automatic Glocks.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.715
And you think that Zach
has these guns with him now?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.484
Yes, which means
we need to find him,

18:37.550 --> 18:39.786
so let's get him on the phone.
Call him now.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.221
We've been trying
to contact him

18:41.288 --> 18:43.456
for the last 24 hours.
He's not answering.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.024
Why didn't you tell us
this earlier?

18:45.091 --> 18:47.627
We thought he was partying,
playing video games.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.362
Okay, well, he's not,
so let's call him back.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.164
Maybe he will answer this time.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.369
On speakerphone.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.671
<i>Hi, this is Zach.</i>

18:58.738 --> 19:00.473
<i>Please leave a message. Thanks.</i>

19:05.111 --> 19:06.979
Ian.
Hey, you ping Zach's phone yet?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.348
I tried.
Looks like it's been shut down

19:08.415 --> 19:10.016
for over 24 hours.
- Okay.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.584
Do we know anything
about his plans?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.353
Is he targeting
a specific person, place,

19:13.420 --> 19:14.787
or is he just running around
with guns

19:14.854 --> 19:16.223
for the sake of running around
with guns?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.358
Probably not that,
but we are short on specifics.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.527
You finally get access
to these kids' text messages?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.028
- Yeah, just came in.
- All right, great.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.463
Start reading.
Elise, we need to start working

19:23.530 --> 19:25.498
traffic and bus cams within
a mile radius to Chapman.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.799
Let's get boots
on the ground too.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.501
I want four units canvassing
that area.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.737
- Just found something.
- Go.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.805
Zach sent Clayton
a text two days ago.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.375
It says, "When this is over
and hundreds are dead,

19:35.442 --> 19:37.977
the world will know our names.
We will be iconic."

19:38.044 --> 19:39.746
All right, we need to
evacuate Chapman right now.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.047
I'll call the head of school.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.249
Let's get local police
down there right away.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.516
You know what?
I'm gonna head to campus,

19:43.583 --> 19:46.986
see what I can learn.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.635
Go all the way in.
All the way in to the back.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.673
Move out
in an orderly fashion.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.014
What's up, buddy?

20:15.081 --> 20:16.883
Yeah, yeah, just do what
the police officers tell you.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.885
Your mom is waiting
for you outside.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.753
No, no, everything's fine.
No one's been hurt.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.956
We're just being
extremely cautious.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.559
Exactly. All right.
I'll talk to you soon.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.695
I love you, bud. Bye.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.165
Hi.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.668
Agent Valentine.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.737
To be clear, we have not found
any evidence

20:37.804 --> 20:39.506
explicitly referencing Chapman.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.008
But we do believe Zach O'Connor
is armed and dangerous

20:42.074 --> 20:43.843
and planning some sort of
mass shooting event,

20:43.910 --> 20:45.678
but it will not
take place here.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.380
We have 40 agents
surrounding the school.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.282
Has anyone seen
Zach recently?

20:49.349 --> 20:50.883
He's been out of touch
for about 24 hours,

20:50.950 --> 20:52.051
which means he's hiding out,

20:52.118 --> 20:53.686
likely someplace
near the school

20:53.753 --> 20:55.254
or his parents' house.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.089
I know you've been counseling
him for the past few months.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.891
Do you have any idea
where he might go?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.993
Did he ever mention a hangout
or a hideout somewhere

21:01.060 --> 21:03.129
he might go when he's
feeling anxious or depressed?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.731
No, sorry.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.733
We just talked about
his emotions, his anxiety,

21:06.799 --> 21:08.535
lack of confidence.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.869
I thought he was doing better.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.571
Okay.
Who does he hang out with?

21:11.638 --> 21:14.874
Who might he turn to when he's
feeling afraid or desperate?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.309
He was pretty aloof,

21:16.376 --> 21:18.911
but he did start talking
about a student he just met,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.747
said they were becoming
close friends.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.248
Great.
Okay, do you have a name?

21:22.315 --> 21:25.385
Yes, right here. Tyler.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.223
He never mentioned a last name.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.209
Hey, why didn't you tell me
about Zach O'Connor?

21:50.276 --> 21:51.811
What?

21:51.878 --> 21:54.981
You didn't see that he'd been
spending time with Clayton?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.883
He's Clayton's accomplice.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.951
- No, that's not right.
- Yes, it is.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.520
And I need
to find him right now.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.355
He's a good guy.
He helps people.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.691
No, Tyler. He killed someone.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.892
No, that's not right.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.193
If it weren't for him,
I would've gotten

22:07.259 --> 22:09.629
my ass kicked last week,
but Zach stood up for me.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.230
Got in this kid's face.

22:11.297 --> 22:12.765
He said we were friends,
and the kid backed down.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.767
That--that may be,
but Tyler,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.235
if you are not
telling me something,

22:16.302 --> 22:18.004
if you know anything
about this robbery--

22:18.070 --> 22:19.071
The hell are you talking
about?

22:19.138 --> 22:20.507
Of course
I don't know anything.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.609
I'm not some criminal or some
weird high school freak.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.876
Is that what you think?

22:34.053 --> 22:36.723
When was the last time
you talked to Zach?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.057
A couple of days ago.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.292
Do you have any idea
where he might be hiding?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.728
No.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.730
Do you have any idea
who he might be going after?

22:49.702 --> 22:50.837
I don't know.

22:52.605 --> 22:55.141
Okay.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.309
Well, look, if you think
of anything that could help,

22:57.376 --> 22:59.412
would you please call me?

22:59.479 --> 23:03.616
And until we sort this out,
you need to stay in the house.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.994
I can't believe
Zach killed someone.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.062
He is, like,
the only kid at school

23:16.128 --> 23:17.764
who's actually nice to me.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.974
- We need to find your son.
- I know. I wanna find him too.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.509
Look, I know
how these things go.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.143
So just tell me
whatever you want me to do.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.779
Okay, do you guys have
a second home anywhere?

23:32.845 --> 23:34.213
No.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.682
Okay, what about an office?
An apartment?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.083
Anywhere where he might
feel comfortable hiding at?

23:37.149 --> 23:38.585
No, no, nothing like that.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.987
But my sister has a place
a mile from the school.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.388
What do you mean?

23:42.455 --> 23:43.856
She's been in London
the past couple of months.

23:43.923 --> 23:44.891
The place is empty.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.459
And Zach knows this?

23:46.526 --> 23:48.461
Yes, and he has a key too.

23:48.528 --> 23:51.831
He goes there once a week
to water the plants.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.500
Okay, what's the address?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.274
Federal agents!

24:02.341 --> 24:04.477
We have a warrant!

24:11.851 --> 24:14.754
Upstairs, clear.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.155
The house is clear.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.662
He was definitely here.

24:33.706 --> 24:38.277
I have a receipt
for 3:16 PM today.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.549
Zach's cell
is turned off, right?

24:44.216 --> 24:47.353
Somebody used this landline?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.155
- Maybe.
- Re-dial.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.960
<i>Hi, this is Tyler.
Please leave a message.</i>

24:56.195 --> 24:59.632
The last call that he made
was to Jubal's son?

25:08.174 --> 25:10.342
Tyler?

25:10.409 --> 25:12.011
Hello?

25:14.446 --> 25:16.015
Tyler?

25:18.618 --> 25:20.486
Tyler. Tyler.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.354
Hey, take these off.
- What are you doing?

25:22.421 --> 25:23.790
Why aren't you
answering my call?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.925
- I just didn't hear it.
- Did Zach O'Connor call you?

25:27.794 --> 25:29.629
- Yeah.
- And you didn't tell me?

25:29.696 --> 25:30.963
You didn't think
I'd wanna know?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.932
It was really brief.
He just started rambling.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.433
He wasn't making much sense.
- Did he say where he was?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.735
- No.
- Did he say where he is going?

25:35.802 --> 25:37.570
- No.
- What did he say exactly?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.338
He just kept saying,
"I'm gonna be iconic."

25:39.405 --> 25:40.673
Over and over.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.041
I said,
"What are you talking about?"

25:42.108 --> 25:43.610
and he said, "You'll see,"
and then he hung up.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.279
I'm gonna need you
to call him, okay?

25:47.346 --> 25:48.547
If he answers,

25:48.615 --> 25:50.249
ask him where he is,
where he's going.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.584
I don't wanna get Zach
in trouble.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.385
Okay, you need to snap out
of this fog.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.655
Zach O'Connor
is a dangerous young man.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.624
He's my friend.
Why can't you understand that?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.425
He committed
a horrible crime, Tyler.

25:59.491 --> 26:01.894
He murdered an innocent person.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.496
And we're pretty sure he's
looking to kill more people.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.999
So this is not about
your so-called friendship.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.835
There is nothing so-called
about it--it's real.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.370
And he's been there for me
when I need him, unlike you.

26:19.378 --> 26:23.082
Look, I'm glad that Zach
has been a good friend.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.317
I get it.
- No, you don't.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.019
You've no clue
what I deal with.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.160
What I go through.
What's it's like to be me.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.597
The weak kid.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.267
The sick kid.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.070
The cancer kid.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.615
Hey.

27:03.656 --> 27:04.991
You're gonna get better,

27:05.057 --> 27:07.026
and you're gonna
feel more confident.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.896
I promise you.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.867
You just have to believe that
and be patient, okay?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.836
But right now,
we've gotta find Zach

27:16.903 --> 27:21.240
so I can help him before
he hurts someone else, okay?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.714
Okay, so if he said anything

27:27.780 --> 27:31.483
that could be helpful
in your phone call...

27:31.550 --> 27:34.186
Like I said, he was rambling.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.890
But right before he hung up,

27:37.957 --> 27:39.826
he said he was thinking
about me...

27:42.829 --> 27:45.331
Because he was wearing my hat.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.699
Your hat?

27:46.766 --> 27:48.500
Why would he
be wearing your hat?

27:48.567 --> 27:50.236
He said he found it
on the floor.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.171
Thought it was a good omen,
so he put it on.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.940
Uh, where did you
leave your hat?

27:55.407 --> 27:57.810
I lost it last week.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.578
We were hanging out
over by this old theater

27:59.645 --> 28:00.847
over by the train station.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.954
Hey, Scola, I think
I know where Zach is staying.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.839
FBI! Put your hands up now.

28:28.140 --> 28:32.111
I--I didn't
do nothing, I swear, I--

28:32.178 --> 28:33.212
Drop the bag.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.054
Are you by yourself?
- Just me.

28:52.631 --> 28:55.134
Hey, Tiff?

28:55.201 --> 28:56.135
Nine-millimeter.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.239
So Zach comes here,
hides out for a little while,

29:00.306 --> 29:01.841
then heads back into the world
with his AR

29:01.908 --> 29:03.175
and his Glock
loaded to the hilt.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.912
- No, not necessarily.
- What do you mean?

29:05.978 --> 29:07.079
The only ammo that they stole

29:07.146 --> 29:09.581
from the gun shop
was a nine-mill.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.250
He's not gonna chamber
an AR with that.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.952
He's gonna need a .223.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.589
Hey, Jubal. It's Tiff.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.191
We need the address
to the closest gun store

29:19.258 --> 29:21.127
to 345 Grafton Street.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.561
There's a good chance
Zach O'Connor

29:22.628 --> 29:24.096
is headed there right now.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.645
We have shots fired
at 2241 Grove Street

29:39.711 --> 29:41.814
at Ed's Gun and Ammo.
We're going in now.

29:50.756 --> 29:53.692
Hey, hey, you're
gonna be okay, all right?

29:53.759 --> 29:55.294
I need an ambulance here now.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.429
I have a gunshot victim
who's breathing and conscious

29:57.496 --> 29:58.697
but bleeding profusely.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.543
No sign of the suspect.
He fled the scene on foot.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.644
We need to set up
a containment,

30:45.711 --> 30:47.279
half-mile perimeter now.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.015
Ugh!

30:49.081 --> 30:51.117
Zach O'Connor is in the wind.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.119
Good news,
gunshot victim is stable.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.720
Looks like he's gonna survive.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.455
The bad news is,
Zach now has enough ammo

30:56.522 --> 30:57.924
for his AR 15.

30:57.990 --> 31:01.093
He is locked and loaded,
ready to carry out his mission,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.295
the event
that is gonna make him iconic.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.997
So we need to find him.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.666
Traffic cams, bus cams.
Get me a visual.

31:07.733 --> 31:08.935
I got him.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.744
Zoom in.
Let's make sure it's him.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.879
And he's armed.

31:20.947 --> 31:24.016
Yeah, it's him. Where is he?

31:24.083 --> 31:25.184
Corner of Heathcote
and Wilmot.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.386
Okay, call OA.
Give him the location.

31:27.453 --> 31:28.720
Copy that.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.122
We need to know
what this young man is up to.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.758
What is his target?
Who does he hate or love?

31:32.824 --> 31:34.560
How is he planning
to become iconic?

31:34.626 --> 31:35.928
Let's get to work.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.339
<i>Tyler.
Have you heard from Zach?</i>

31:47.406 --> 31:48.674
No.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.009
We have not found him yet,
but we did find

31:50.076 --> 31:52.211
a video of him
on Heathcote and Wilmot.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.213
You know where that is?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

31:54.280 --> 31:55.681
Do you have any idea
why he'd be over there?

31:55.747 --> 31:56.715
Did he have any friends
over there?

31:56.782 --> 31:58.650
Enemies? Girlfriends?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.452
<i>I don't know, we've only
been friends for a month.</i>

32:00.519 --> 32:01.853
<i>I don't know
everything about him.</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:05.424
Okay, well, have you thought
of anything else

32:05.491 --> 32:07.326
<i>that might be help--</i>

32:07.393 --> 32:09.061
I gotta go.
I got another call coming.

32:09.128 --> 32:12.231
What--who's calling?
No, don't hang up. Tyler!

32:13.732 --> 32:15.201
God.

32:18.370 --> 32:22.441
Sam! Tyler!

32:22.508 --> 32:24.010
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, is he still here?

32:24.076 --> 32:25.644
Yeah, he's upstairs. Why?

32:25.711 --> 32:27.479
- Uh.
- What happened?

32:27.546 --> 32:29.848
Jubal, talk to me.

32:29.915 --> 32:32.518
Tyler? Tyler?

32:35.854 --> 32:38.357
Ty?
I thought you said he was here.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.392
He was, I just brought him
a snack ten minutes ago.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.162
Tyler?

32:43.229 --> 32:44.596
Tyler!

32:44.663 --> 32:46.232
You said you were gonna
make sure he didn't leave.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.666
I've been checking on him
every ten minutes.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.201
- What is going on, Sam?
- He got mad. He told me to--

32:49.268 --> 32:51.603
Are you paying attention?

32:51.670 --> 32:53.705
Our child is a mess here.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.241
He's hanging out
with kids that are--

32:55.307 --> 32:57.443
Don't you dare
put this on me.

32:57.509 --> 33:01.380
I am the one who is here
every day, trying to help him,

33:01.447 --> 33:03.915
encourage him.
I'm not a magician.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.052
I can't just wave a wand

33:06.118 --> 33:09.755
and make
our son's cancer go away.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.023
Trying to make him the cool,

33:11.090 --> 33:12.858
confident kid
that you want him to be.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.726
I know. I know.

33:14.793 --> 33:15.994
I didn't mean that.

33:16.062 --> 33:19.365
I'm just--I'm sc--I'm scared.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.832
If Tyler is somehow
mixed up in this,

33:20.899 --> 33:22.034
I know it's my fault.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.869
It's because I wasn't
involved enough,

33:23.935 --> 33:26.838
it's because I wasn't present,
and that is going to change.

33:26.905 --> 33:29.408
I pro--I promise you.

33:29.475 --> 33:32.411
I need to go now before--

33:32.478 --> 33:34.513
call me
if you get a hold of him.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.148
I will.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.390
Where are we
on Tyler's phone?

33:44.456 --> 33:45.557
Have you been able
to locate him?

33:45.624 --> 33:47.626
Yes, and we're
tracking his GPS now.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.861
We're also tracking the phone
that just called him too.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.663
Looks like he's heading west.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.765
- We have a name?
- Jeremy Brosnihan.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.801
He's the owner of the gun shop,
the guy who just got shot.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.968
Zach must have grabbed
his phone

33:57.035 --> 33:58.370
on the way out the door.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.005
We've been looking over
his social media accounts.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.074
He posts a lot about a girl
named Grace Gilmore.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.709
He seems pretty
obsessed with her.

34:03.775 --> 34:04.976
In one of his posts, he says,

34:05.043 --> 34:06.712
"You laughed
at the wrong dude."

34:06.778 --> 34:09.481
I don't see any overt threats
or anything like that.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.949
Just a hunch.
- Who is Grace Gilmore?

34:11.016 --> 34:12.984
She is a junior
at Westchester South,

34:13.051 --> 34:15.121
about a mile
from Zach's current location.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.156
Okay. Call the school.
Have them evacuate right now.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.224
Copy.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.960
Jubal, it's Reynolds.
We have eyes on Tyler's GPS.

34:22.027 --> 34:24.196
He's heading east
on Chesterfield Road.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.497
Copy that. What about Zach?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.399
We're tracking his GPS too.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.700
He's in the same vicinity
as Tyler.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.202
We have agents
in pursuit right now.

34:30.269 --> 34:33.172
All right, stay with me.
Let me know where Tyler is.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.606
He's just gone stationary.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.508
Corner of Chesterfield
and Tompkins Road.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.277
Okay, copy that.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.427
Tyler?

34:55.494 --> 34:58.497
Tyler! Tyler!

34:58.564 --> 35:00.666
Tyler!

35:00.732 --> 35:03.435
No, no, no. Zach! Zach!

35:03.502 --> 35:05.404
Zach! Drop the gun! FBI!

35:05.471 --> 35:06.438
Put your hands on your head!

35:06.505 --> 35:07.906
Don't come any closer!

35:07.973 --> 35:09.741
I'll shoot him! I swear to God!

35:11.543 --> 35:13.078
You lied to me, Tyler!
You lied!

35:13.145 --> 35:14.613
Zach, that's not
what happened.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.416
Get back! I'll kill him.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.684
I'll kill everyone.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.387
Every single person
in this damn town.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.989
So get back now!

35:26.892 --> 35:30.229
Okay. I'm getting back.
Zach, don't go in there.

35:30.296 --> 35:33.832
Zach, don't go in there!
We can work this out!

35:33.899 --> 35:35.734
Get down! Get down!

35:40.939 --> 35:42.374
I have eyes on the suspect.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.843
He's inside a bookstore
in Tompkins and Chesterfield.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.679
He has several hostages.
Send SWAT right away.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.660
Zach is inside.
He has several hostages.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.396
Okay, what's the plan?

36:04.463 --> 36:06.131
I'm going inside.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.699
Nina, go around back.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.401
No, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, we wait for SWAT.

36:09.468 --> 36:12.037
No, we're not.
Nina, 'round back.

36:12.103 --> 36:16.875
OA, you can get a clean angle
from over here if need be.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.649
Okay, Jubal. Jubal!

36:26.184 --> 36:28.520
Are you sure?

36:28.587 --> 36:30.289
My son is one
of the hostages.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.760
I'm sure.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.141
I told you to stay away!

36:50.208 --> 36:51.943
I know. I know.
I'm just--I'm here to help.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.612
I've been talking
to your parents,

36:53.679 --> 36:55.046
and they're very concerned,
and they asked me

36:55.113 --> 36:57.516
to help you to make sure
you didn't get hurt.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.318
I want a plane.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.786
And I wanna go to Mexico.

37:00.852 --> 37:04.256
Okay. We can talk about that.
I'm here to help.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.057
I promise you, okay?

37:06.124 --> 37:08.427
So please,
let's put the gun down.

37:08.494 --> 37:09.728
Let's let these people go,

37:09.795 --> 37:11.129
and then you and I
will sit down,

37:11.196 --> 37:12.831
and we'll talk about it.
We'll figure it out.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.801
Just do what he says.
He'll help you. I promise.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.769
Okay, good.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.838
I want a plane,
or I'll kill him.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.006
I'll shoot him in the head,
I swear to God.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.341
Zach, you do not
wanna kill Tyler.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.343
He's a good kid.
He cares about you very much.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.745
He told me that
he appreciates your friendship.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.113
You protect him
from bullies at school.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.548
Is that true?

37:35.654 --> 37:37.022
Well, I wanna thank you.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.860
I'm grateful to you
for doing that.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.864
That's who you are.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.434
Man, you're a protector.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.703
You care about people.
You're not a killer.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.840
So please,
let's put the gun down, okay?

37:59.010 --> 38:03.181
Please put the gun down.

38:03.248 --> 38:05.951
I want a plane.
And I want a car.

38:06.017 --> 38:09.921
An SUV, a black Escalade.
So go!

38:09.988 --> 38:12.991
Get out of here, or I'll
start shooting, I swear to God!

38:15.394 --> 38:20.466
Zach, please. Please.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.934
What you're asking for,

38:23.001 --> 38:28.006
a plane, an SUV, that's--
it's a bad idea,

38:28.073 --> 38:30.942
and I'm gonna tell you why, okay?

38:31.009 --> 38:34.312
Because the second you walk
out this door,

38:34.380 --> 38:36.648
you are in danger.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.884
The agents out there,

38:38.950 --> 38:41.753
they do not care about you.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.222
They do not wanna help you.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.625
They don't know
that you are a good kid,

38:46.692 --> 38:49.227
that you're a protector.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.830
I'm telling you,
I am your best move.

38:51.897 --> 38:54.332
So please, put the gun down.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.234
You have three seconds!

39:01.039 --> 39:03.775
Zach,
I'm not leaving the store.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.413
Zach, if you wanna
kill somebody, kill me!

39:15.286 --> 39:18.323
- No, no!
- Hey, hey, hey. Go, go, go.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.259
- I'll kill you.
- We got him. Go, go.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.743
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.010
You good?

39:39.077 --> 39:41.947
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. Thanks.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.761
Kid's barely 17 years old.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.163
Yeah, and now his life
is officially over.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.036
You ever find out
what was wrong?

40:05.103 --> 40:06.538
What was going on with him?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.073
I mean, not really, no.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.108
I'm guessing
we never will, either.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.577
Yeah, I don't get it.
I don't know

40:11.643 --> 40:14.546
how the parents couldn't see
that he was unraveling.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.616
Well, kids don't always share
what they're feeling, you know.

40:17.683 --> 40:20.652
And yeah, sometimes parents
don't wanna see it

40:20.719 --> 40:24.022
even if they pretend to because,

40:24.089 --> 40:27.258
I mean, it's just really hard.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.497
Anyway.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.000
I'm gonna talk to your dad.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.404
Hey, he's doing okay.
All things considered.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.406
Yeah, thanks for keeping
an eye on him.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.809
He's strong.
And your boy is gonna be fine.

40:49.781 --> 40:50.882
Thanks, guys.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.350
Hey, how are you doing?

40:52.417 --> 40:54.753
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, you sure?

40:54.820 --> 40:56.722
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.290
Talk to me.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.927
I wasn't trying to help Zach.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.830
I was trying to convince him
to surrender.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.699
I wanted to help
do something good.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.602
I know.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.403
I'm proud of you.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.039
Proud for what?

41:14.105 --> 41:16.007
I screwed up.
I almost got you killed.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.408
You kidding me?

41:19.077 --> 41:20.846
Tyler,
you saved my life in there.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.717
If it weren't for your strength
and your bravery,

41:25.784 --> 41:27.318
I would be dead.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.124
So thank you.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.862
I love you.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.533
I love you too.
