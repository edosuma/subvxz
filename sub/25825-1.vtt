00:20.614 --> 00:22.547
Hope.

00:22.549 --> 00:24.416
What an ironic name

00:24.418 --> 00:26.719
for a girl dying of cancer,
don't you think?

00:26.721 --> 00:30.322
And what's more depressing
than a kid dying of cancer?

00:30.324 --> 00:32.223
Nothing, of course.

00:32.226 --> 00:34.661
So I have two options.

00:34.663 --> 00:38.665
I can either be
depressed, emo teen, so obvs,

00:38.667 --> 00:41.001
or I can embrace it.

00:41.003 --> 00:44.270
It's my note from the doctor
for life.

00:44.272 --> 00:45.973
No homework.
Teachers let you slide.

00:45.975 --> 00:48.307
Ice cream in the lunch line.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.411
People are nice to you,

00:50.413 --> 00:51.647
because they feel bad for you.

00:52.782 --> 00:54.580
And why shouldn't they?

00:54.582 --> 00:57.385
I-It's cancer,
and why shouldn't I use it?

00:58.487 --> 01:00.888
I know how my story ends.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.859
Terminal is terminal.

01:03.994 --> 01:05.660
You know, I...

01:05.662 --> 01:08.297
There are no unwritten chapters
yet to come.

01:09.799 --> 01:11.534
And I'm comfortable
knowing that.

01:12.703 --> 01:14.002
So don't judge.

01:14.004 --> 01:16.038
I'm not giving up.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.574
I'm just practical.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.719
You know what? Hands out.

02:05.091 --> 02:06.590
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

02:06.592 --> 02:08.324
All but one of them are ready.

02:08.327 --> 02:10.526
I can have the other one
sent to her at the hospital

02:10.529 --> 02:12.362
- later if you'd like.
- Oh, God, no.

02:12.364 --> 02:14.065
Curbside service is enough.
Don't have to do that.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.334
No, Mom, it's my Zofran,
and if I don't have it,

02:16.336 --> 02:18.635
- I will be vomiting everywhere.
- Ehh. That's gross.

02:18.637 --> 02:19.871
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

02:19.873 --> 02:20.940
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.675
You know what?
You haven't eaten anything yet,

02:24.677 --> 02:26.979
so put the phone down,
and then you can vlog later.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.414
Eat this banana.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.650
Banana!

02:32.051 --> 02:33.718
What's that?

02:33.720 --> 02:36.420
"Eat me, Hope. Eat me."

02:36.422 --> 02:37.691
Okay. Give it to me.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.565
My mom
had the brilliant idea

02:46.567 --> 02:48.600
of naming me Hope
after her favorite line

02:48.602 --> 02:50.669
from some
dead British guy's book.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.437
It's not her fault.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.406
Who would have known
that this would have happened?

02:54.408 --> 02:55.709
Hope!

02:58.712 --> 03:00.780
You shouldn't have.

03:00.782 --> 03:02.949
- It's on me today.
- Oh, thanks.

03:02.951 --> 03:04.884
I promise I won't be around
for much longer.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.855
Wouldn't want
to put you out of business.

03:07.989 --> 03:09.556
But she's amazing,

03:09.558 --> 03:11.991
if, at times, a bit much.

03:11.993 --> 03:13.994
Okay, so I'm picking you up
after school today

03:13.996 --> 03:15.395
for your doctor's appointment.

03:15.397 --> 03:16.964
Is that today?

03:16.966 --> 03:19.766
Mm-hmm. Yeah, no.

03:19.768 --> 03:21.001
Your test results came back.

03:21.003 --> 03:22.972
Yay. More bad news.

03:24.774 --> 03:26.075
All right.

03:28.946 --> 03:30.778
You're strong and beautiful.

03:30.780 --> 03:33.013
Chemo's nothing.
You got this. I love you.

03:33.015 --> 03:35.616
Do we really
have to do this every time?

03:35.618 --> 03:37.786
Okay, I'm strong,
and I'm beautiful,

03:37.788 --> 03:40.557
and I've got this,
and I love you, too.

03:45.128 --> 03:46.462
- Bye.
- Okay.

03:59.910 --> 04:01.012
Hey, Dr. Pham.

04:03.047 --> 04:05.981
Kids are
supposed to be like Twinkies,

04:05.983 --> 04:08.119
born with no sign
of an expiration date.

04:10.688 --> 04:12.722
I'm more like milk.

04:12.724 --> 04:14.492
There's one stamped right on me.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.094
And, sure, you can try
and run away from it...

04:19.831 --> 04:21.798
but you're
in for a rude awakening.

04:23.801 --> 04:26.203
Uh, coming through.
Make way for the dying girl.

04:26.205 --> 04:28.071
You know, don't want
to be late for chemo.

04:28.073 --> 04:31.041
Gotta get my drip on,
so, yeah, might not...

04:31.043 --> 04:32.978
might not make it, so...

04:34.647 --> 04:35.648
Hit three, please.

04:37.082 --> 04:38.682
Chocolate still
your favorite, Stephanie?

04:38.684 --> 04:39.585
You know it.

04:42.187 --> 04:44.588
So I learned
to embrace my situation

04:44.590 --> 04:46.257
with a sense of humor.

04:46.259 --> 04:49.093
They say that laughter
is the best medicine.

04:49.095 --> 04:51.763
Two white blood cells
bump into each other.

04:51.765 --> 04:54.968
and one says to the other one,
"Funny seeing you here."

04:57.237 --> 04:58.738
Drop mic.

05:00.774 --> 05:02.942
It's been a real lifesaver.

05:09.283 --> 05:11.750
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

05:11.752 --> 05:14.121
Sarah, it is time
to distract her.

05:15.290 --> 05:17.290
Okay.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.626
I just learned
about guided imagery.

05:20.761 --> 05:23.963
Okay, let me see if I remember.

05:23.965 --> 05:28.234
You are laying
on a nice warm beach.

05:28.236 --> 05:30.703
Your feet are in the sand,

05:30.705 --> 05:34.874
and you're laying on that
tie-dye towel that I...

05:34.876 --> 05:36.977
That's Sarah,

05:36.979 --> 05:40.114
the best thing to come out
of this entire situation.

05:40.116 --> 05:43.216
We met almost five years ago
in a hospital support group.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.919
She has cancer, too, obviously,

05:45.921 --> 05:47.823
and when you have cancer,
you just get it.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.658
All flushed.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.626
Port seems to be working
just fine.

05:52.628 --> 05:54.796
I'm ready to hook you up as soon
as Pharmacy brings up the bag.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.035
It's important to get it.

06:04.807 --> 06:07.141
How we doing here?

06:07.143 --> 06:10.044
Oh, just, you know,
chilling to some chemo

06:10.046 --> 06:11.812
and "The Fault in Our Stars."

06:11.814 --> 06:13.315
Any pain?

06:13.317 --> 06:16.685
Well, if I had
to give it a number,

06:16.687 --> 06:19.121
um, it'd be an eight,

06:19.123 --> 06:25.027
so can I have more snacks
and a ginger ale, please?

06:25.029 --> 06:26.530
Of course.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.135
They should really start
a patient of the month contest.

06:33.137 --> 06:36.139
Don't you think that'd be
an unfair competition?

06:36.141 --> 06:38.341
God, you love attention.

06:38.343 --> 06:41.311
I love attention just as much
as the next person,

06:41.313 --> 06:44.182
but I wouldn't say
that I take advantage of it.

06:48.219 --> 06:51.157
And how you doing? Any pain?

06:52.758 --> 06:56.993
Um, I guess
I'd say the second one,

06:56.995 --> 06:58.761
who just looks constipated.

06:58.763 --> 07:02.833
That reminds me, um,
my mom wants you to text her,

07:02.835 --> 07:04.970
something about fibrous juices.

07:06.272 --> 07:08.072
I'm sorry. I know she's a lot.

07:08.074 --> 07:11.775
No. Heh. No, it's sweet.

07:11.777 --> 07:15.046
I welcome
D's overprotective doting.

07:15.048 --> 07:17.881
My mom's
been so busy these days.

07:17.883 --> 07:19.683
Okay.

07:19.685 --> 07:23.721
I'm going to disconnect you
and flush you again.

07:23.723 --> 07:24.758
Okay.

07:34.768 --> 07:36.734
I can taste it.

07:36.736 --> 07:37.838
Mm-hmm.

07:43.211 --> 07:44.811
Water, Zofran.

07:52.321 --> 07:54.987
Mm. Thank you.

07:54.989 --> 07:56.090
You all set?

07:58.427 --> 08:00.026
You should come over this week,

08:00.028 --> 08:01.694
any days
your mom's working late.

08:01.696 --> 08:03.396
D can make us
something extra bland

08:03.398 --> 08:05.298
for us to not want to eat.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.171
Okay.

08:12.007 --> 08:13.173
Love you.

08:13.175 --> 08:14.375
Love you more.

08:14.377 --> 08:15.711
Not possible.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.020
That's Seth.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.755
He's my best friend, too.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.359
Yes, you can have
two best friends. It's 2016.

08:31.361 --> 08:34.097
Like most people in the world,
he doesn't have cancer.

08:35.798 --> 08:38.402
He's only 17,
but sometimes he acts 40.

08:39.503 --> 08:41.169
Hey. How you feeling?

08:41.172 --> 08:42.436
- Hey. Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
- You good?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.837
- Did you eat before chemo?
- Yes.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.006
- You did? Okay, cool.
- Yes.

08:45.008 --> 08:46.841
Do you need the notes for
Mrs. Laga's class, by the way?

08:46.843 --> 08:48.110
Yeah. Here.
I saved you a ginger ale.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.078
No, you drink it. You need it.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.780
Okay, well, let's go.
We're gonna be late for school.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.048
Wait. Since when do you
care about school?

08:53.050 --> 08:55.083
Since I have art first period.

08:55.085 --> 08:56.053
Right.

08:58.523 --> 09:02.325
♪ Oh, my love ♪

09:02.327 --> 09:05.328
♪ My darling, I ♪

09:05.330 --> 09:08.130
- -
That's Kai, my boyfriend.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.999
That sounds weird
to say out loud.

09:10.001 --> 09:12.335
I definitely said it in my head
thousands of times.

09:12.337 --> 09:14.438
Yeah, my boyfriend.
My boyfriend.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.373
Okay, yeah, that sounds crazy.

09:19.911 --> 09:21.077
Hang on, babe.

09:21.079 --> 09:22.979
Y-You're doing too much.

09:22.981 --> 09:25.149
Yeah, I should probably
just take a nap or something.

09:25.151 --> 09:26.917
Yeah, yeah.
Let's get you a kip.

09:26.919 --> 09:27.820
Okay.

09:29.055 --> 09:30.088
Come here.

09:39.198 --> 09:41.099
So my mother and I were

09:41.101 --> 09:44.101
on my Make-A-Wish trip
this past summer in Australia.

09:44.103 --> 09:46.371
I always wanted to snorkel
the Great Barrier Reef.

09:46.373 --> 09:49.207
Turns out, uh, snorkeling's
harder than it looks,

09:49.209 --> 09:51.142
especially with health issues.

09:51.144 --> 09:54.211
There we were, just trying to
capture some fish with a GoPro.

09:54.213 --> 09:56.081
I must have looked
like I was drowning,

09:56.083 --> 09:59.985
'cause Kai swam up
and offered his assistance.

09:59.987 --> 10:01.820
Instant sparks.

10:01.822 --> 10:03.855
But he showed us around the city
for the next few days,

10:03.857 --> 10:07.058
most romantic experience
of my life,

10:07.060 --> 10:09.528
even with my mom
three steps behind.

10:09.530 --> 10:11.830
So when he found
I didn't have long,

10:11.832 --> 10:15.401
he came to the States with us,
applied for some kind of grant.

10:15.403 --> 10:17.003
Apparently Australia
is all right

10:17.005 --> 10:19.037
with wanting young people
to see the world,

10:19.039 --> 10:20.141
so that's cool.

10:22.577 --> 10:24.979
You make dying
look so desirable.

10:30.118 --> 10:31.520
Are you talking to me?

10:33.021 --> 10:35.122
Is anybody else
dying in art class?

10:35.124 --> 10:37.257
No. Um, sorry.

10:37.259 --> 10:39.462
I just thought you
didn't know who I was, so...

10:40.963 --> 10:42.962
Of course I know who you are.

10:42.964 --> 10:44.164
You're Cancer Girl.

10:44.166 --> 10:47.167
And Kai's girlfriend, of course.

10:47.169 --> 10:48.403
Where did you get him?

10:48.405 --> 10:50.138
Make-A-Wish.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.340
You can get a hot guy
at Make-A-Wish?

10:52.342 --> 10:54.241
No, no. It was the trip,

10:54.243 --> 10:57.044
um, and he
was just a bonus, so...

10:57.046 --> 11:00.148
Oh, I was gonna say,
"I want cancer." I'm kidding.

11:00.150 --> 11:02.150
Is he a good kisser, though?

11:02.152 --> 11:04.320
I'm not kidding,
because I was looking at him,

11:04.322 --> 11:05.986
and I was like...

11:05.988 --> 11:07.889
Like, I feel
he'd be a good kisser.

11:07.891 --> 11:10.459
You know, I-I don't really
have much to compare it to.

11:10.461 --> 11:14.430
Um, so if it's bad,
it's probably me.

11:14.432 --> 11:17.365
Yeah, probably.

11:17.367 --> 11:18.469
Can I have him when you're done?

11:20.170 --> 11:21.437
W-Wait. What?

11:21.439 --> 11:23.441
Just think about it.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.010
Okay.

11:27.579 --> 11:29.244
No. No, no.

11:29.246 --> 11:31.647
Please stop. Stop.
I look terrible today.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.948
You don't, actually.

11:34.386 --> 11:36.018
Did you, uh,
study for Bio, by the way?

11:36.020 --> 11:37.589
Yes.

11:39.358 --> 11:42.024
Sort of. No, look.
I-I talked to Mr. Baser,

11:42.026 --> 11:44.927
and he said that I didn't have
to worry about the test, so...

11:44.929 --> 11:47.597
When was the last time
you actually took a test?

11:47.599 --> 11:49.700
I took a blood test
this morning.

11:49.702 --> 11:51.302
Something that requires
a little more effort.

11:51.304 --> 11:52.936
And a PET scan. You know,

11:52.938 --> 11:54.404
sometimes they make you
hold your breath.

11:54.406 --> 11:56.172
Oh, wow.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.608
Well, if you feel like studying,

11:57.610 --> 11:59.543
tonight I'm gonna
outline chapter 23.

11:59.545 --> 12:01.545
It wouldn't hurt to...

12:01.547 --> 12:03.247
to, you know, try.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.085
Hope.

12:08.087 --> 12:10.354
Yes. I'm listening.

12:10.356 --> 12:12.325
- What'd I just say?
- I'm listening now.

12:30.344 --> 12:31.443
This is for you.

12:31.445 --> 12:33.478
We think you're so brave.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.748
You're like the girl from "The
Fault in Our Stars," but real.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.618
What's it like to be
Zoe's new best friend?

12:38.620 --> 12:40.353
Did... Did she say that?

12:40.355 --> 12:42.020
Did she say I'm actually
her new best friend?

12:42.022 --> 12:43.589
Oh, she's never spoken to us.

12:43.591 --> 12:46.159
Oh, my gosh. If she
talked to us, I would die.

12:46.161 --> 12:48.127
Could you put in
a good word for me

12:48.129 --> 12:50.229
when she, you know,
needs a new you?

12:50.231 --> 12:51.632
Yeah.

12:51.634 --> 12:55.201
Um, I-I can tell her
you said, "Hi."

12:55.203 --> 12:56.402
What is your name?

12:56.404 --> 12:57.738
Candy...

12:57.740 --> 12:59.040
Like a Jolly Rancher.

13:01.210 --> 13:02.743
Okay, wow.

13:02.745 --> 13:05.078
I think they mean well.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.446
Aren't those the girls
that got in trouble

13:06.448 --> 13:07.681
for cyberbullying last year?

13:07.683 --> 13:09.283
You know, I-I don't know. I...

13:09.285 --> 13:11.452
Everyone loves me
on the Internet, so...

13:11.454 --> 13:13.721
Yeah, 'cause I disabled the
comment section on your vlog.

13:13.723 --> 13:16.524
Cupcake?

13:16.526 --> 13:17.691
How are your classes going?

13:17.693 --> 13:19.426
Real good.

13:19.428 --> 13:21.629
Really? 'Cause you're
failing them all.

13:21.631 --> 13:23.431
I've got a D in English.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.065
I'm good at English.

13:25.067 --> 13:28.303
Hope, I really think
it's a good idea

13:28.305 --> 13:30.370
for you to apply yourself
a little bit more.

13:30.372 --> 13:31.639
Why?

13:31.641 --> 13:34.578
'Cause, you know...

13:36.814 --> 13:38.647
Are you familiar with the idea

13:38.649 --> 13:43.685
that life is about the journey
and not the destination?

13:43.687 --> 13:47.088
Yeah. They tell you that
when you're dying, so...

13:47.090 --> 13:49.994
Look, I know you might be reaching
your destination sooner than some...

13:51.830 --> 13:53.997
but don't you want
your journey to be richer?

13:55.233 --> 13:57.066
I think it's more rich.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.502
They're both right, actually.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.403
Well, how can two things

14:01.405 --> 14:03.105
be right at the same time?

14:03.107 --> 14:04.708
Well, if you showed up
to philosophy class,

14:04.710 --> 14:05.708
you would know.

14:05.710 --> 14:08.145
Ha. Good one, Mr. G.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.582
You gonna eat that cupcake?

14:12.584 --> 14:14.384
Paging Nurse
Ceylon on Telemetry...

14:14.386 --> 14:16.219
Rub it in.

14:16.221 --> 14:18.220
Mom, I basically am
hand sanitizer at this point.

14:18.222 --> 14:20.357
so you don't need
to tell me what to do.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.158
I know how to rub it in.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.694
After this, let's go
get some of that, uh...

14:23.696 --> 14:25.796
- that trail life tea.
- You know what?

14:25.798 --> 14:28.833
I'd rather not, because I don't
like drinking stale farts,

14:28.835 --> 14:32.537
so I'd rather just, you know,
die without the tea.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.204
Wow.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.673
Oh, hey, Dr. Choudary.

14:35.675 --> 14:39.377
Good morning, ladies.
We have some news.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.111
There are no signs of cancer

14:41.113 --> 14:43.314
in both hope's blood work
and her PET scan.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.216
What are you saying?

14:45.218 --> 14:48.720
Remission. We're talking
about clinical remission here.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.489
- Clinical remission?
- Mm-hmm.

14:50.491 --> 14:55.126
O-Okay. Wait.
Am I gonna live or die? Like...

14:55.128 --> 14:57.896
There was always a really good
chance of this happening,

14:57.898 --> 15:01.166
but I would never take telling
you something like this lightly,

15:01.168 --> 15:03.368
and we would never use
the word "cured."

15:03.370 --> 15:05.404
We're gonna have
to monitor you very closely

15:05.406 --> 15:08.709
for the first five years.
Cancer is tricky, especially...

15:14.282 --> 15:15.916
You know,
we should have a party.

15:15.918 --> 15:17.684
- Yes.
- Right?

15:17.686 --> 15:19.351
We should invite all
of your new friends.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.788
Bowling.

15:21.790 --> 15:22.922
We should go bowling.

15:22.924 --> 15:26.292
No. No, no. Please, Mom, no.

15:26.294 --> 15:27.661
Come on.
We have to celebrate, right?

15:27.663 --> 15:29.262
Yeah, you used to love bowling.

15:29.264 --> 15:30.897
We used to go bowling
all the time.

15:30.899 --> 15:32.733
Yeah, we went bowling
all the time when I was 12.

15:32.735 --> 15:34.668
Hey, what's your
guidance counselor's name again?

15:34.670 --> 15:36.137
Mr. Garner.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.440
Why?

15:39.442 --> 15:41.575
Oh, I'm writing,
uh, thank-you notes

15:41.577 --> 15:43.811
to all your teachers, and I'm
telling them the good news.

15:43.813 --> 15:47.314
Why do you
do these things?

15:47.316 --> 15:49.416
"Dear Mr. Garner,
thank you for all the help

15:49.418 --> 15:50.885
you've given Hope
these past few years.

15:50.887 --> 15:52.554
I am happy to let you know

15:52.556 --> 15:54.254
that Hope's cancer
is in remission

15:54.256 --> 15:55.689
and she can resume
her studies full time."

15:55.691 --> 15:57.859
It's not... It's not terrible.

15:57.861 --> 15:59.761
Guess it's back to homework.

15:59.763 --> 16:02.965
Thank you, Mother.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.734
Mm.

16:04.736 --> 16:08.303
Hey, you...
You like Mr. Garner, right?

16:08.305 --> 16:10.372
He was helpful with all
the extension stuff?

16:10.374 --> 16:12.608
Yeah, he's fine.

16:12.610 --> 16:14.810
Well, do you want to maybe talk
to him instead of a therapist?

16:14.812 --> 16:17.412
I'm fine up here. It's the body
that's not cooperating.

16:17.414 --> 16:20.650
All right, well, just... I just...
You know, if it's a money thing,

16:20.652 --> 16:23.221
we could figure out
a way to make it work.

16:24.922 --> 16:26.622
Look, he... he knows
we're... we're poor.

16:26.624 --> 16:28.357
I mean, it's okay.

16:28.359 --> 16:29.458
It's true.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.926
Well, we're not really...

16:30.928 --> 16:34.965
I mean, I could help her study,
you know?

16:34.967 --> 16:37.299
Thank you for your enthusiasm.

16:37.301 --> 16:39.302
Both of you.

16:39.304 --> 16:41.237
- Mm-hmm.
- Hate you guys.

16:49.248 --> 16:50.315
How are you eating?

16:51.417 --> 16:53.917
Oh, I-I just told my mom

16:53.919 --> 16:56.687
I'd try harder to eat, so...

16:56.689 --> 16:58.455
Now it's your turn.

16:58.457 --> 17:00.024
For guided imagery.

17:00.026 --> 17:01.759
Oh, okay. Heh.

17:01.761 --> 17:04.429
So close your eyes,
and keep 'em closed.

17:04.431 --> 17:08.366
Describe to me
your dream meal in detail.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.635
Okay.

17:12.006 --> 17:16.875
I would have spaghetti
with meat sauce.

17:16.877 --> 17:20.444
Oh, and... and Parmesan cheese,
you know, like the kind

17:20.446 --> 17:22.313
they grate on top
right in front of you,

17:22.315 --> 17:23.816
and they ask you
when to stop,

17:23.818 --> 17:25.584
but I would never say stop.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.685
I feel you.

17:26.686 --> 17:28.687
I would just start eating,

17:28.689 --> 17:31.892
and the whole meal, the waiter
would just be shredding away.

17:33.861 --> 17:35.794
A-And, um, what about dessert?

17:35.796 --> 17:37.630
I-I know that's
your favorite part, so...

17:37.632 --> 17:41.600
Mmm. I would have
original tart froyo

17:41.602 --> 17:43.502
with a pizzelle cookie
shoved down the middle

17:43.504 --> 17:46.706
to create a firm boundary,
so on one side,

17:46.708 --> 17:49.943
I could put maraschino cherries
and gummi bears,

17:49.945 --> 17:51.711
and on the other side,

17:51.713 --> 17:54.983
I could put hot fudge
and Reese's Pieces. Heh.

17:56.852 --> 17:58.420
Um, Hope?

18:01.023 --> 18:02.923
Uh, yeah. Um...

18:02.925 --> 18:05.859
Oh, my gosh. I did that
whole visual imagery thing

18:05.861 --> 18:07.627
just so you
could sneak your burger.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.663
No, I didn't. I'm just...
I'm just hungry,

18:09.665 --> 18:12.435
because I-I don't have
to get chemo today, so...

18:13.770 --> 18:15.837
Why don't you have chemo today?

18:15.839 --> 18:19.573
Um, Dr. Choudary thought,
you know, I didn't need chemo,

18:19.575 --> 18:21.542
on... on account
I'm in remission,

18:21.544 --> 18:24.345
and, um, you know,
no... no biggie, so...

18:24.347 --> 18:27.015
Oh, my gosh.
Hope, that's amazing!

18:27.017 --> 18:29.987
Yeah. You know, um, I guess.

18:31.889 --> 18:34.623
I should probably, um,
just get to school.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.692
I'm sure the Man wants me
to study more, so...

18:37.694 --> 18:39.063
Okay.

18:40.665 --> 18:41.696
I love you.

18:41.698 --> 18:43.698
Love you more.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.634
Not possible.

18:45.636 --> 18:48.403
Things are just happening
too fast for me right now.

18:48.405 --> 18:52.075
I-I just don't know how to feel.
Am I happy, scared, angry?

18:52.077 --> 18:54.609
Hungry? I mean,
why am I still hungry?

18:54.611 --> 18:57.380
I-I feel like I need a sign,
you know?

18:57.382 --> 18:58.981
Uh, should I tell everyone,

18:58.983 --> 19:01.752
or should I just let it ride
a little bit longer?

19:06.925 --> 19:07.826
So you need any help?

19:09.460 --> 19:10.828
With what?

19:10.830 --> 19:12.563
Telling everyone.

19:12.565 --> 19:14.865
No. I'm just gonna
tell Sarah first

19:14.867 --> 19:16.766
and then tell
everyone else, so...

19:16.768 --> 19:18.534
Didn't you stop by
the hospital earlier, though?

19:18.536 --> 19:20.804
Yeah, but she was sleeping
and so cute,

19:20.806 --> 19:22.873
and I-I didn't want
to bother her, you know?

19:22.875 --> 19:23.809
All right.

19:25.145 --> 19:26.611
Gonna go do one
of your free periods?

19:26.613 --> 19:28.779
- Yeah.
- All right.

19:28.781 --> 19:31.548
- Bye.
- See you around.

19:31.550 --> 19:34.418
So you know how I've always
been into street art, yeah?

19:34.420 --> 19:36.788
- No, I-I did not know that.
- Babe.

19:36.790 --> 19:40.525
No, you just have so many ideas,
I can't keep track of them all.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.563
Well, this is
my first attempt at street art.

19:45.866 --> 19:47.432
Uh, wow.

19:47.434 --> 19:50.936
Um, there's so many of them.

19:50.938 --> 19:53.872
Where are you
gonna put all of these?

19:53.874 --> 19:56.474
Well, these are all part
of my new campaign, Hope.

19:56.476 --> 19:58.644
I'm gonna stick them
all over the city.

19:58.646 --> 20:01.614
Hopefully I don't get done
by the John Hop.

20:01.616 --> 20:03.850
- The wallopers.
- Uh...

20:03.852 --> 20:05.751
The fuzz. The coppers.

20:05.753 --> 20:06.785
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:06.787 --> 20:08.687
Yes, I know that one.

20:08.689 --> 20:11.157
So hopefully after you're gone,

20:11.159 --> 20:14.494
there's gonna be a small piece
of you left around the city.

20:14.496 --> 20:16.596
- This is so cool.
- Um, yeah.

20:16.598 --> 20:20.033
Uh, can we... can we please...

20:20.035 --> 20:22.471
Can we just go talk
someplace more private?

20:32.948 --> 20:35.149
Hope, you're shaking.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.618
Yeah. Well, look at that.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.654
Is it the chemo?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.222
Mm, I don't know.

20:41.224 --> 20:43.257
Is it bad news?

20:43.259 --> 20:46.560
Well, define "bad news." Um...

20:46.562 --> 20:49.697
Well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

20:49.699 --> 20:52.267
I'm just not ready
for this to end.

20:52.269 --> 20:57.875
It's... It's not going to end,
and if it does, I'll be here.

20:59.176 --> 21:03.011
Well, what if it's forever?

21:03.013 --> 21:04.548
I'll be here.

21:13.691 --> 21:15.193
This is nice.

21:19.097 --> 21:22.298
So, D, in her never-ending
overstepping of my boundaries,

21:22.300 --> 21:23.900
has decided to put
all the letters

21:23.902 --> 21:25.935
in my teachers' mailboxes.

21:25.937 --> 21:27.770
So many problems with this.

21:35.613 --> 21:36.713
Hope, I've got math.

21:36.715 --> 21:37.781
- What...
- Get back!

21:39.151 --> 21:40.984
Any student
who has not turned in

21:40.986 --> 21:44.154
their permission slip
to attend Hip-Hop Hullabaloo

21:44.156 --> 21:47.825
will not be attending
Hip-Hop Hullabaloo.

21:47.827 --> 21:49.227
Thank you.

21:49.229 --> 21:51.662
Okay, are you
gonna help me or not?

21:51.664 --> 21:53.130
I don't even know
what we're doing.

21:53.132 --> 21:54.865
We're gonna go get back
the letters.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.967
And don't give me
that look, okay?

21:56.969 --> 21:59.204
It's technically not stealing.
She used my stationary, so...

21:59.206 --> 22:01.572
Okay, one more time, why would
we get rid of the letters

22:01.574 --> 22:02.774
that completely solve
your whole dilemma?

22:02.776 --> 22:04.243
I don't have to tell people

22:04.245 --> 22:06.244
until, you know,
I get my life back together.

22:06.246 --> 22:08.313
Okay, so what's the plan?

22:08.315 --> 22:11.016
Okay, we're gonna go in there,
and we're gonna steal...

22:11.018 --> 22:14.220
take back... take back
the letters from the mailboxes.

22:14.222 --> 22:15.955
That's the plan?

22:15.957 --> 22:19.157
Well, it's the f-first draft
of a plan.

22:19.159 --> 22:21.693
- What if Mr. Burda catches you?
- That's why you're here.

22:21.695 --> 22:23.829
You're the lookout,
in case, you know,

22:23.831 --> 22:26.298
um, I get in trouble
or something,

22:26.300 --> 22:30.802
or you just... you could
distract him or something.

22:30.804 --> 22:32.605
Really love the detail
you've put into this.

22:32.607 --> 22:35.608
Okay, I got... Yeah, same.
Okay, let's go. Hands in.

22:35.610 --> 22:36.744
Come on.

22:39.214 --> 22:40.880
Go, team.

22:40.882 --> 22:43.184
Okay, let's do this.

23:00.070 --> 23:03.171
Okay, muffin. You got your tea.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.205
Now what?

23:04.207 --> 23:06.775
Mail!

23:10.380 --> 23:11.913
Mrs. Thompson.

23:11.915 --> 23:14.416
Oh. Nice lady.

23:14.418 --> 23:16.750
She's such a sweetie pie.

23:16.752 --> 23:18.920
Ah, who rearranged this?

23:18.922 --> 23:19.921
Uh...

23:19.923 --> 23:21.789
Mrs. Thompson...

23:21.791 --> 23:24.927
Thompson. Thompson. Thompson.

23:24.929 --> 23:26.095
Thompson. Ompson.

23:26.097 --> 23:28.163
Thom... There she is. All right.

23:28.165 --> 23:31.300
And the next lucky winner.

23:31.302 --> 23:34.002
Ms. Stuart.

23:34.004 --> 23:36.872
Snippy, snappy Stuart.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.441
She's a cow.

23:38.443 --> 23:41.176
Hmm. Stuart. Stu...

23:41.178 --> 23:42.613
Oh. There we go.

23:44.248 --> 23:47.016
Oh! I think I put that
in the wrong box.

23:47.018 --> 23:48.320
Nope, that's good.

23:50.322 --> 23:52.988
Coach Callenberg. All right.

23:52.990 --> 23:55.291
Rah, rah, sis-boom-bah.

23:55.293 --> 23:58.096
Football team's
not gonna go so far.

23:59.465 --> 24:03.102
Callenberg. Callenberg.
There we go.

24:07.473 --> 24:10.042
Oh. All done.

24:11.477 --> 24:12.710
Now what?

24:12.712 --> 24:14.647
Oh, lunch.

24:19.352 --> 24:21.452
Uh, yeah.

24:21.454 --> 24:23.689
- Ring the bell. That's gonna...
- Okay, go. Go.

24:29.495 --> 24:30.961
I'm eating.

24:30.963 --> 24:32.930
You see...

24:32.932 --> 24:35.400
Come back after lunch.

24:35.402 --> 24:37.035
Bye.

24:37.037 --> 24:38.504
- Scoot. Scoot.
- Yeah.

24:38.506 --> 24:39.973
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

24:42.976 --> 24:45.010
She even wrote one
to the janitor.

24:45.012 --> 24:47.946
You know what? Maybe I'm just
gonna drop out. My mom did.

24:47.948 --> 24:49.916
Yeah, 'cause she stopped
fitting into the uniforms.

24:49.918 --> 24:50.917
She was pregnant.

24:50.919 --> 24:53.051
I'm kidding.

24:53.053 --> 24:55.122
Mostly. I'll study.

24:57.058 --> 24:58.858
Wait. You're not planning
on using cancer

24:58.860 --> 25:01.227
- as a way to not study, right?
- No! I'll do it.

25:01.229 --> 25:03.129
Good. It's important
for you to start focusing

25:03.131 --> 25:04.964
and actually, like,
you know, learning something.

25:04.966 --> 25:06.832
Seth, I got it.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.301
You know what this means?

25:08.303 --> 25:10.036
We can go to college
and grad school now.

25:10.038 --> 25:11.471
We can get apartments
in the city.

25:11.473 --> 25:13.242
I'm not ready
to think about that yet.

25:16.345 --> 25:17.879
So what does Kai think?

25:19.215 --> 25:21.281
He's... He's really cool with it.

25:21.283 --> 25:22.883
He doesn't know, does he?

25:22.885 --> 25:24.351
I mean, what does
knowing really...

25:24.353 --> 25:27.121
- You didn't tell him?
- I-I told him.

25:27.123 --> 25:29.489
No, you're lying right now. 'cause your
voice gets, like, super high when you lie.

25:29.491 --> 25:31.792
That's what's happening right now. Yeah,
you're lying right now. I can hear it.

25:31.794 --> 25:33.494
- No, it's not.
- I know you're lying every time.

25:33.496 --> 25:36.331
- These are for you.
- Also we're totally wearing

25:36.333 --> 25:38.833
these stickers of your face
to support you.

25:38.835 --> 25:40.268
Wow.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.470
What does Zoe smell like?

25:42.472 --> 25:43.906
Not like desperation.

25:46.576 --> 25:49.578
I wanted to know if you wanted to get
a mani-pedi with me after school.

25:49.580 --> 25:53.414
Oh, I-I've never gotten
a real mani-pedi before.

25:53.416 --> 25:56.319
Okay. Cool.
We can have some quality time...

25:57.421 --> 25:58.356
alone.

26:02.159 --> 26:04.426
These look better
than the last batch, so...

26:04.428 --> 26:05.561
Hey, bub.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.997
So right now,

26:07.999 --> 26:09.965
I'm in a lot of trouble
for these stickers.

26:09.967 --> 26:11.900
Apparently, you guys
had this street artist

26:11.902 --> 26:13.969
who designed
Barack Obama's first campaign,

26:13.971 --> 26:15.972
and he had
the slogan "Hope," too,

26:15.974 --> 26:18.776
so it makes me look
like a complete cherry picker.

26:20.144 --> 26:23.046
- I... Like, I look like a dag.
- No.

26:23.048 --> 26:25.548
- I-I look like a silly bum.
- No. Just...

26:25.550 --> 26:27.951
I look like One Direction
stealing Janoskians music.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.219
I-I look like a fraud!

26:30.289 --> 26:32.289
Ahh! They're everywhere!

26:38.498 --> 26:40.532
So, uh, you still
want to come study with me?

26:41.967 --> 26:44.268
No. I'm gonna go
get a mani-pedi.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.571
I can't study with my nails
looking like normal, can I?

26:47.573 --> 26:48.939
Of course not.

26:55.315 --> 26:57.114
Thanks for inviting me.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.351
Yeah. I do it every week.

26:59.353 --> 27:02.220
It's expensive, but that's what
my dad's credit card is for.

27:02.222 --> 27:03.655
He feels bad
that he's never around,

27:03.657 --> 27:05.289
and that's why he does it,

27:05.291 --> 27:07.359
but doesn't stop him.
Cool, right?

27:07.361 --> 27:09.661
The cooliest.

27:09.663 --> 27:13.065
So, um, are you dating anyone?

27:13.067 --> 27:14.900
God, no.

27:14.902 --> 27:16.635
Guys my age are so obnoxious.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.437
I think I need someone
more sensitive.

27:18.439 --> 27:20.339
Yeah. You know,
I got lucky with Kai,

27:20.341 --> 27:21.907
but even then, I had to travel

27:21.909 --> 27:24.043
halfway across the world
to get him, so...

27:26.381 --> 27:28.149
My nails look so pretty.

27:40.162 --> 27:44.431
So what'd the teachers say
about the good news?

27:44.433 --> 27:46.165
Uh, about what now?

27:46.167 --> 27:49.069
About your remission letters
that I sent.

27:49.071 --> 27:51.238
Right. Um, no, nothing.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.307
You know,
no one's called me yet.

27:53.309 --> 27:57.544
Everyone's super busy
with midterms and... and stoof.

27:57.546 --> 27:59.380
Are you taking those?

27:59.382 --> 28:01.716
That's the plan, and if
it's all on chapter one,

28:01.718 --> 28:04.185
page one, paragraph one,
I'll be fine.

28:04.187 --> 28:06.487
Oh, you're gonna do great.

28:06.489 --> 28:09.393
Yeah, well, I have plenty
of time to be great now, so...

28:13.130 --> 28:15.464
What's happening
on your fingernails?

28:15.466 --> 28:17.732
Oh, I got a manicure.
Do you like it?

28:17.734 --> 28:19.134
Yeah, I like...

28:19.136 --> 28:22.170
Uh, we can't afford a manicure.

28:22.172 --> 28:24.573
Okay. Well, Zoe paid for it.

28:24.575 --> 28:26.409
and she considers it
therapeutic, so...

28:26.411 --> 28:28.744
Oh. Zoe.

28:28.746 --> 28:30.412
Zoe, the doctor.

28:30.414 --> 28:32.247
Uh, when do I get to meet her?

28:32.249 --> 28:34.316
- Maybe later.
- Tonight?

28:34.318 --> 28:37.587
I don't know, Mom, but, um,
I'm gonna go study mitosis,

28:37.589 --> 28:40.924
and if I can remember correctly,
it's how cancer cells replicate.

29:04.450 --> 29:06.750
Can't wait to hear
why these were in your bag

29:06.752 --> 29:08.452
and not
in your teachers' mailboxes.

29:08.454 --> 29:11.289
Well, why were you
going through my stuff?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.524
Why are you stealing
from mailboxes?

29:13.526 --> 29:15.226
This is a fun game.

29:15.228 --> 29:17.530
Because I want
to tell everyone on my own.

29:19.164 --> 29:21.468
I-I was only trying to help.

29:22.735 --> 29:24.738
I don't need your help, so...

29:26.540 --> 29:29.774
Okay, yeah.

29:29.776 --> 29:31.275
Okay.

29:31.277 --> 29:32.680
Can you close the door?

29:52.100 --> 29:54.533
Then she says, "Close the door."

29:54.535 --> 29:56.536
There's no closed doors
in our house.

29:56.538 --> 29:59.205
So I want to keep helping her,
but I have to help her

29:59.207 --> 30:00.841
in the way that I haven't
always helped her,

30:00.843 --> 30:01.842
so I need your help.

30:01.844 --> 30:03.811
What can I do?

30:03.813 --> 30:05.712
You know, I want
to respect her boundaries,

30:05.714 --> 30:07.480
and I want to give her space,

30:07.482 --> 30:09.282
but I also have
to keep tabs on her hard-core.

30:09.284 --> 30:11.084
You want me to spy on her?

30:11.086 --> 30:12.285
Yes.

30:12.287 --> 30:13.721
Heh, I'm not gonna do that.

30:13.723 --> 30:16.322
You know, then guide her
or counsel her.

30:16.324 --> 30:19.460
You know, i-it's actually built
into your job title.

30:19.462 --> 30:21.160
You know,
what do you guys actually do?

30:21.162 --> 30:22.563
Both those things,

30:22.565 --> 30:24.300
but not always in that order.

30:26.703 --> 30:28.536
Sorry. I'm, uh,

30:28.538 --> 30:30.571
coming off angrier
than I intend to.

30:30.573 --> 30:35.477
Just, I-I do not know
how to help her anymore.

30:35.479 --> 30:37.312
Look, if anything happens,

30:37.314 --> 30:39.581
I will definitely
let you know about it.

30:39.583 --> 30:43.451
But otherwise, you're gonna have to
let her figure it out on her own.

30:43.453 --> 30:45.820
And what if she ends up
making terrible choices?

30:45.822 --> 30:48.691
She's a kid.

30:48.693 --> 30:51.663
She's definitely
gonna make bad choices.

30:54.231 --> 30:55.632
Great.

30:59.370 --> 31:00.271
Thank you.

31:05.208 --> 31:07.208
- Oh, Dolores...
- Uh-huh?

31:07.210 --> 31:09.278
Could you close the door?

31:09.280 --> 31:11.516
Oh, yeah.
I see what you did there.

31:28.399 --> 31:30.767
Is it better
to burn out or fade away?

31:30.769 --> 31:33.938
I-I mean, look at Heath Ledger
or James Dean

31:33.940 --> 31:35.940
or Janis Joplin
or Jimmi Hendrix.

31:35.942 --> 31:37.675
I mean, they all died young,

31:37.677 --> 31:40.310
not like these old people
that just keep on living,

31:40.312 --> 31:43.413
and you're just like,
"Gah, when is it gonna happen?"

31:43.415 --> 31:45.683
That was mean, but, anyway,

31:45.685 --> 31:49.287
I'm just asking a hypothetical
question for a friend.

31:49.289 --> 31:53.325
Is it better to die popular
or live a loser?

31:54.494 --> 31:56.361
Heh. Oh, my God.

31:56.363 --> 31:58.897
You... You see
that girl over there?

31:58.899 --> 32:00.566
Yeah.

32:00.568 --> 32:02.534
Go ask her
if she wants to sit with us,

32:02.536 --> 32:05.271
and when she's like, "Yes,"
say, "I'm kidding."

32:06.439 --> 32:07.706
That's not really funny.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.541
That's the point of a joke.

32:09.543 --> 32:10.778
I'll do it.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.455
Hey, you want
to come sit with us?

32:23.457 --> 32:26.593
Hey. You were supposed
to meet me. What happened?

32:26.595 --> 32:28.694
What are
you listening to?

32:28.696 --> 32:30.797
- I just forgot. I-I'm sorry.
- You mean you didn't want to?

32:30.799 --> 32:32.866
No, I did.
I was just studying last night.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.835
Did you know that I have six
midterms, one for every subject?

32:35.837 --> 32:37.270
Yeah.

32:37.272 --> 32:38.639
Seth, stop bothering her.

32:38.641 --> 32:39.973
She has cancer.

32:39.975 --> 32:41.643
Yeah, but it's...

32:43.278 --> 32:45.412
Oh, my God!

32:45.414 --> 32:47.848
It's getting worse?

32:47.850 --> 32:49.517
Oh, my God. The cancer?

32:49.519 --> 32:51.287
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

32:53.422 --> 32:56.357
Hey. Here you go.

32:56.359 --> 32:57.758
Those guys are jerks.
Don't worry about it.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.326
- Thank you.
- Sure.

32:59.328 --> 33:02.633
It's getting worse, so...

33:04.967 --> 33:06.902
"Hey, Hope,
what did you do today?"

33:06.904 --> 33:09.037
"Oh, I just told everyone
and their mom

33:09.039 --> 33:12.574
that my cancer's getting worse,
and that's so not true,

33:12.576 --> 33:14.810
and I'm such a liar,
and I hate myself."

33:14.812 --> 33:16.812
Oh, my God. I'm so sad.

33:16.814 --> 33:18.613
We just got mani-pedis.

33:18.615 --> 33:20.649
I want to throw you a party
to, you know, help.

33:20.651 --> 33:22.617
It'll be kind of like a wake,
but you're still alive.

33:22.619 --> 33:24.620
No. No, no, no.
I can't let you do that.

33:24.622 --> 33:25.988
You're not letting me.
I want to.

33:25.990 --> 33:27.657
My house, next Friday. Cool.

33:27.659 --> 33:29.791
Okay, but that
wasn't part of the plan,

33:29.793 --> 33:31.828
- but there was...
- Hope.

33:31.830 --> 33:34.597
Where have you been?
Why didn't you tell me?

33:34.599 --> 33:36.899
I just told Zoe,
like, 60 seconds ago.

33:36.901 --> 33:38.403
How did you find out?

33:39.672 --> 33:41.303
Okay. Um...

33:41.305 --> 33:42.705
Is it true?

33:42.707 --> 33:44.574
Yes?

33:44.576 --> 33:46.409
I need to tell you something.

33:46.411 --> 33:48.846
Okay, so some of the most
perfect things in life

33:48.848 --> 33:51.782
don't last forever,
like sunsets or rainbows

33:51.784 --> 33:54.084
or the polar ice caps,

33:54.086 --> 33:56.687
and I know you're
not gonna be around forever,

33:56.689 --> 34:00.557
so I wanted to tell you
how I really felt.

34:00.559 --> 34:01.792
I love you.

34:01.794 --> 34:03.864
No, no, you don't.

34:04.964 --> 34:06.463
Oh, my God. You do.

34:06.465 --> 34:08.400
Well, I love you, too, Kai.

34:10.536 --> 34:13.538
So the cooliest thing
happened today.

34:13.540 --> 34:16.007
Kai told me he loved me,
and I love him, too,

34:16.009 --> 34:17.842
so that's cool.

34:17.844 --> 34:20.445
Hey, are you coming
to the bowling party tomorrow?

34:20.447 --> 34:22.981
- Yeah. I'll be there.
- So great you told everyone,

34:22.983 --> 34:25.550
and now Zoe's throwing
that party for you Friday night.

34:25.552 --> 34:27.351
Hey, are her parents
gonna be there?

34:27.353 --> 34:29.454
Um, probably not.
They have weird jobs, so...

34:29.456 --> 34:31.991
O-Oh, okay.

34:31.993 --> 34:33.859
Yeah, Mom, okay.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.761
So we're, um, hanging out,
so you can just not...

34:35.763 --> 34:37.963
Oh, not be here? Okay.

34:37.965 --> 34:42.067
So Zoe's throwing you a party.

34:42.069 --> 34:43.803
That's pretty cool.

34:43.804 --> 34:45.638
Yeah, okay.
It's not a big deal, okay,

34:45.639 --> 34:47.773
so let's just watch,
you know, watch a movie.

34:47.775 --> 34:49.775
What about "Me, Earl,
and the Dying Girl"?

34:49.777 --> 34:52.710
Or how about "Life of Pi"?

34:52.713 --> 34:54.380
Or "The Kings of Summer"

34:54.382 --> 34:56.049
- or "Life is Beautiful"?
- No.

34:56.051 --> 34:57.851
No more movies
about death, okay?

34:57.853 --> 34:59.052
Death isn't a joke.

34:59.054 --> 35:00.787
Okay, I'll put on "Life of Pi,"

35:00.789 --> 35:02.789
or whatever,
but I'm not happy about it.

35:02.791 --> 35:05.391
You're not happy about anything.

35:05.393 --> 35:08.662
Oh, I know.
What if you weren't dying?

35:08.664 --> 35:10.497
- Would that make you happy?
- Okay.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.099
Mmm, wait. Mmm.

35:12.101 --> 35:15.169
Okay, okay, look,
I-I need you more than anyone

35:15.171 --> 35:17.171
to understand what
I'm going through, you know?

35:17.173 --> 35:18.707
I-I'll tell them.

35:20.043 --> 35:21.510
Wait.

35:23.513 --> 35:25.913
Wait. You didn't
even tell them yet?

35:25.915 --> 35:29.050
I'm getting there.
I just need more time.

35:29.052 --> 35:31.419
You need more time? Oh, my God.

35:31.421 --> 35:33.821
That is such a non-terminal
person thing to say.

35:33.823 --> 35:37.025
Hey, that's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

35:37.027 --> 35:38.994
No, it's not.
In the sixth grade,

35:38.996 --> 35:41.029
boys called you Casper,
the flat-chested ghost.

35:41.031 --> 35:42.563
Stop.

35:42.565 --> 35:44.199
Look, I already feel
pretty bad.

35:44.201 --> 35:46.702
You should have seen
Seth and my mom's faces.

35:46.704 --> 35:48.837
They were, like, so happy.

35:48.839 --> 35:51.440
And you're not happy?

35:51.442 --> 35:53.442
Well, I'm not not happy.

35:53.444 --> 35:57.046
I'm just scared for how
everything's gonna change.

35:57.048 --> 35:59.749
Things were always
going to change anyway.

35:59.751 --> 36:01.720
This kind of change is good.

36:02.854 --> 36:04.453
I like things the way they are.

36:04.455 --> 36:07.190
I-I like my boyfriend.

36:07.192 --> 36:08.992
I like my friends. I...

36:08.994 --> 36:10.760
I mean, you should see
how mean everyone is

36:10.762 --> 36:12.129
to the kids who don't fit in.

36:12.131 --> 36:13.964
They broke
some girl's phone today.

36:13.966 --> 36:16.666
I'm glad cancer is
all about the attention for you,

36:16.668 --> 36:18.534
because for me,

36:18.536 --> 36:21.071
it's about how
I can't go to school

36:21.073 --> 36:22.842
or swallow food...

36:24.010 --> 36:25.910
that I'll never be kissed,

36:25.912 --> 36:29.947
and that pretty soon,
I will be completely forgotten.

36:29.949 --> 36:31.649
I won't forget about you.

36:31.651 --> 36:34.219
- You already have.
- That's so not true.

36:34.221 --> 36:36.787
You know, maybe...
maybe we aren't really friends.

36:36.789 --> 36:38.223
Maybe we never really were.

36:38.225 --> 36:40.557
Maybe we just had dying
to keep us close,

36:40.559 --> 36:44.164
because right now, it seems
like we have nothing in common.

36:45.966 --> 36:47.766
You know what? You're right.

36:47.768 --> 36:49.968
Because I have... I have Zoe now,

36:49.970 --> 36:52.172
and I don't even care
about you anymore.

36:53.639 --> 36:55.106
They don't actually like you.

36:55.108 --> 36:56.841
They actually love me.

36:56.843 --> 36:59.147
Kai told me,
so you're just jealous.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.182
Oh, God.

37:20.134 --> 37:22.235
Okay, I convinced that nurse

37:22.237 --> 37:24.171
to let us get in
to see the doctor first,

37:24.173 --> 37:25.973
and then I was able
to push back my 2:30,

37:25.975 --> 37:28.574
so now we will able
to squeeze all of this in.

37:28.576 --> 37:30.143
Then I'm gonna
drop you off at home,

37:30.145 --> 37:34.181
and then I have got
to get back to the office.

37:35.284 --> 37:37.019
It's a busy day, huh?

37:38.154 --> 37:40.087
Yeah, it's a busy day.

37:40.089 --> 37:42.189
Yeah, I just walked
right up to her, and I was like,

37:42.191 --> 37:44.057
"My daughter
is having a transplant.

37:44.059 --> 37:47.561
We need to meet
with Dr. Karato immediately."

37:47.563 --> 37:50.665
It's a power thing
with these doctors,

37:50.667 --> 37:52.735
making you wait.
Drives me nuts.

37:54.004 --> 37:56.706
Hey, how are you feeling?

37:59.209 --> 38:00.608
I'm fine.

38:02.612 --> 38:05.079
Great. You mind?

38:05.081 --> 38:06.581
No, I'm good.

38:06.583 --> 38:07.849
Go for Helen.

38:07.851 --> 38:09.650
No.

38:09.652 --> 38:11.186
No, absolutely not.

38:11.188 --> 38:12.089
You tell him no.

38:14.992 --> 38:17.192
Hey, come on.

38:17.194 --> 38:18.729
Come on.

38:21.899 --> 38:24.300
You know, I really should be
studying, getting good grades.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.836
No, hey, hey, don't worry
about it. This is great.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.138
- Okay, this is the future.
- If this is the future,

38:29.140 --> 38:30.839
where's cancer
when you need it, you know?

38:30.841 --> 38:32.208
Look, you can finally embrace

38:32.210 --> 38:33.910
all the things
life has to offer, okay?

38:33.912 --> 38:36.279
Everything you could ever want
is within reach.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.048
Well, I can reach the pamphlets.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.116
I... Do I need the pamphlets?

38:40.118 --> 38:42.652
You do. Look,
we've got community college.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.988
We've got
computer programming school.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.623
- Exciting.
- We've got the Army

38:46.625 --> 38:48.725
- and the Navy.
- No and no.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.062
Look, okay, why don't we just
grab a couple of these pamphlets

38:51.064 --> 38:54.931
and go over 'em, I don't know,
say, maybe Friday, 10 p.m.?

38:54.933 --> 38:58.636
I think you know that's
when Zoe's party for me is.

38:58.638 --> 39:00.337
Guess you're planning
on going to that.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.374
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with my boyfriend

39:02.376 --> 39:04.241
to the super-cool party
being planned for me

39:04.243 --> 39:06.744
instead of sitting inside,
looking at lame pamphlets

39:06.746 --> 39:09.381
that are for careers
15 years ahead, so...

39:09.383 --> 39:11.249
Hey, at least you admit
you've got 15 more years.

39:11.251 --> 39:13.018
Cobber, mates.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.319
Hey, babe.

39:14.321 --> 39:16.055
You're lookin' bonzer as ush.

39:17.291 --> 39:20.092
So, uh, what are you doing here?

39:20.094 --> 39:23.295
Um, I'm not here for me.
I-It's for Seth.

39:23.297 --> 39:25.864
Ah, cool.
You gonna be a digger, mate?

39:25.866 --> 39:28.300
- What'd you call me?
- You wanna join the Army.

39:28.302 --> 39:30.368
Oh, God, no.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.904
Now I want you to take this
pamphlet home, and look at this.

39:32.906 --> 39:35.041
You get some pair of sunglasses,
too. How 'bout that?

39:35.043 --> 39:36.676
Thank you.

39:36.678 --> 39:40.011
Hope, it's so brave
of you to be here.

39:40.013 --> 39:41.414
It must be so depressing

39:41.416 --> 39:43.416
to see people inspire
to have a career.

39:43.418 --> 39:45.218
I think it's "aspire," actually.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.886
Totally.

39:46.888 --> 39:48.224
Hope!

39:49.924 --> 39:51.291
Nurse Joyce.

39:51.293 --> 39:54.794
Ooh. Hope, is this
the famous Kai?

39:54.796 --> 39:57.264
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

39:57.266 --> 40:00.134
His eyes are even
more sparkly than you described.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.969
Yep. There are
many solar systems.

40:01.971 --> 40:04.036
And that accent, mmm.

40:04.038 --> 40:05.872
Um, I just want
to thank you so much

40:05.874 --> 40:08.308
for looking after Hope.
It's been hard, you know.

40:08.310 --> 40:11.178
Despite all the treatment,
she's still getting worse.

40:11.180 --> 40:12.813
What are you talking about?

40:12.815 --> 40:14.983
Oh, that Hope
is super close to dying

40:14.985 --> 40:16.483
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

40:16.485 --> 40:18.152
Hope's not dying.

40:18.154 --> 40:21.222
Oh. Do you guys
call it something else?

40:21.224 --> 40:23.791
- "You guys," as in doctors?
- Totally.

40:23.793 --> 40:26.261
Hope, uh,
I thought you told them.

40:26.263 --> 40:27.928
What's she talking about, babe?

40:27.930 --> 40:29.397
Yeah, "babe,"
what's she talking about?

40:29.399 --> 40:33.835
Uh, I was going to tell you...

40:33.837 --> 40:35.304
Your manicure.

40:35.306 --> 40:37.339
I'm going to tell you,

40:37.341 --> 40:40.975
uh, right... now.

40:40.977 --> 40:42.078
Um...

40:43.980 --> 40:45.281
Well, are you gonna tell us?

40:45.283 --> 40:47.149
Uh, totally. Um...

40:47.151 --> 40:50.453
Well, uh, you know how it's
really meant a lot to me

40:50.455 --> 40:52.388
to have so many
new friends, and...

40:52.390 --> 40:56.091
Kai, you... you know
how you feel about you,

40:56.093 --> 40:57.927
and I know
how you feel about me,

40:57.929 --> 41:00.530
so I'm just...
I'm just gonna say it. Um...

41:00.532 --> 41:03.366
I'm actually not getting sicker,
I'm actually getting better,

41:03.368 --> 41:07.170
so I'm getting so much better
that I don't need treatment,

41:07.172 --> 41:09.406
on account
that I'm getting better. Um...

41:09.408 --> 41:12.478
in conclusion,
I am not dying a teenager.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.012
Ta-da.

41:16.014 --> 41:17.480
Eww.

41:17.482 --> 41:19.115
Um, we're supposed
to replace you.

41:19.117 --> 41:20.484
Hey, this has nothing
to do with you.

41:20.486 --> 41:21.987
Yes, it does.
We brought her cupcakes.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.326
Kai, say something.

41:27.893 --> 41:29.260
You lied to me.

41:29.262 --> 41:31.295
It was an accident.
It just came out,

41:31.297 --> 41:33.464
and I'm better.
Isn't that all that matters?

41:33.466 --> 41:38.303
Look, Hope,
I care about you. I do.

41:38.305 --> 41:42.940
I'm 17. I'm not ready
for a long-term commitment.

41:42.942 --> 41:46.078
I left Australia for you.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.349
I haven't seen
my family in ages.

41:50.485 --> 41:52.453
But you love me.

41:55.289 --> 41:57.424
I mean, you love me, right?

41:59.994 --> 42:01.893
Bigger wanker than I thought.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.862
Yeah, well, at least
I'm not in love with some girl

42:03.864 --> 42:06.965
who thinks I'm just some bloke!

42:06.967 --> 42:09.404
Oh, my God.
You totally love her.

42:10.872 --> 42:12.305
Whatever.

42:12.307 --> 42:13.509
I'm just gonna
go paint something.

42:23.486 --> 42:25.452
I heard Hope
doesn't have cancer anymore,

42:25.454 --> 42:28.054
so we're gonna have
to change the name of my party.

42:28.056 --> 42:31.157
What about a cupcake party?

42:31.159 --> 42:32.395
Yes.

42:36.232 --> 42:38.032
I hope you're happy.

42:38.034 --> 42:39.303
What?

42:40.436 --> 42:42.236
You're the only reason

42:42.238 --> 42:44.071
I'm at this stupid
career fair to begin with,

42:44.073 --> 42:47.275
embracing dumb life
and its stupid opportunities.

42:47.277 --> 42:49.577
No, that's life.
Sometimes you get hurt.

42:49.579 --> 42:52.146
What do you know
about getting hurt?

42:52.148 --> 42:54.316
Dying is easy.

42:54.318 --> 42:56.084
Life is hard.

42:56.086 --> 42:59.622
You have... You have no idea
what I go through.

42:59.624 --> 43:02.425
I've been around you
every day now.

43:02.427 --> 43:04.559
Every day, I'm here with you.
You tell me your problems,

43:04.561 --> 43:06.194
and I'm listening to you.

43:06.196 --> 43:07.596
I know
what you're going through.

43:07.598 --> 43:09.434
All you do is
just follow me around.

43:11.402 --> 43:13.371
Fine. I'm out.

43:15.540 --> 43:18.142
Well, thanks for another
great life event.

43:22.581 --> 43:26.916
Today was kind of...
kind of the worst day ever.

43:26.918 --> 43:29.921
I went from being
at the top of the top to...

43:31.423 --> 43:32.857
nothing.

43:34.393 --> 43:36.059
Don't have
any more fake friends,

43:36.061 --> 43:37.996
and my real friends
can't stand me.

43:44.236 --> 43:45.569
Hello.

43:45.571 --> 43:47.237
Hey.

43:47.239 --> 43:49.707
- Hey!
- What are those?

43:49.709 --> 43:53.377
- These are apology brownies.
- Why?

43:53.379 --> 43:55.245
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're not for you.

43:55.247 --> 43:57.648
They're for all of the people
that Hope lied to.

43:57.650 --> 44:00.184
But why are you sorry?
You didn't...

44:00.186 --> 44:01.953
You didn't do anything wrong.

44:01.955 --> 44:03.954
I didn't do anything wrong,
but Hope did,

44:03.956 --> 44:06.124
and she's my kid
and reflects on me,

44:06.126 --> 44:07.527
so I baked brownies.

44:10.498 --> 44:15.502
Dolores, it is not your job
to protect her.

44:18.037 --> 44:20.641
You know, people say that.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.675
People say that a lot,

44:23.677 --> 44:25.647
but if I didn't protect her...

44:27.348 --> 44:29.148
she could have died.

44:29.150 --> 44:31.083
You know what
I've protected her from?

44:31.085 --> 44:34.354
I've protected her from germs,
getting too much sun.

44:34.356 --> 44:37.757
I have actually protected her
from elderly people hugs.

44:37.759 --> 44:41.093
All right, I have been
a one-person defensive line,

44:41.095 --> 44:45.064
and this high school,
it's like a malignancy, right?

44:45.066 --> 44:47.768
Those mean girls,
they're like an infection.

44:47.770 --> 44:51.037
High school is just hard.

44:51.039 --> 44:53.773
Forget cancer
or a girl with one parent.

44:53.775 --> 44:56.644
It's just hard.

44:56.646 --> 44:58.779
All day long,
I've got kids who need to learn

44:58.781 --> 45:01.382
how to build up
their own immunities.

45:01.384 --> 45:04.252
Half of high school is learning
how to live in this world.

45:07.156 --> 45:09.459
She wasn't supposed
to live in this world...

45:12.763 --> 45:15.229
and I didn't prepare her to.

45:15.231 --> 45:18.165
Well, guess what, Dolores,
she is now,

45:18.167 --> 45:21.670
and there's no right way
of going about this,

45:21.672 --> 45:24.406
but you got to let her
figure it out.

45:24.408 --> 45:26.477
Agh!

45:27.778 --> 45:30.345
I don't like it.

45:30.347 --> 45:32.483
What... What do you
want me to tell you?

45:34.117 --> 45:35.317
Told me enough.

45:35.319 --> 45:37.185
I got it.

45:37.187 --> 45:39.254
See? I guided and counseled.

45:39.256 --> 45:40.823
- Yeah. Caught it.
- Yeah.

45:40.825 --> 45:42.725
- Ah, thank you.
- It's quite impressive.

45:42.727 --> 45:44.327
Heh.

45:44.329 --> 45:46.262
Earned yourself
a plate of brownies.

45:46.264 --> 45:47.797
No, no, no, no. I can't. It's...

45:47.799 --> 45:49.332
- I can't.
- Oh, all right.

45:49.334 --> 45:50.435
No, no, no. It's actually...
It's fine.

45:51.536 --> 45:52.737
Yeah.

45:55.673 --> 45:57.507
Do you think
anyone is gonna come

45:57.509 --> 45:58.742
to this bowling party tomorrow?

45:58.744 --> 46:00.477
What bowling party?

46:03.715 --> 46:05.784
Five bucks,
this is a gutter ball.

46:07.786 --> 46:10.254
Well, this isn't sad at all.

46:10.256 --> 46:12.289
No one came
to your bowling party, D.

46:12.291 --> 46:13.192
Mr. G came.

46:15.427 --> 46:17.761
Look, I'm sorry
that Kai broke up with you.

46:17.763 --> 46:20.597
Yeah, well, I feel like
cancer broke up with me, too.

46:20.599 --> 46:22.332
You weren't dating cancer.

46:22.334 --> 46:24.536
Yeah, well, it lived with me,
slept with me,

46:24.538 --> 46:26.172
brought me lots of flowers
and attention.

46:27.573 --> 46:31.043
Uh, no.
People brought you those.

46:32.345 --> 46:34.347
Yeah, because I had cancer.

46:36.851 --> 46:39.216
You know, forget
about Kai and those girls,

46:39.218 --> 46:41.352
because the people who matter
still care about you.

46:41.354 --> 46:43.621
Well, screwed that up,
too, so...

46:43.623 --> 46:45.858
I texted Seth and Sarah,
like, a million times,

46:45.860 --> 46:46.892
and nothing.

46:46.894 --> 46:49.128
Were you being a brat?

46:49.130 --> 46:50.696
Thank you.

46:50.698 --> 46:52.463
Glad to know you're
not on my side either.

46:52.465 --> 46:54.265
This isn't about sides.

46:54.267 --> 46:56.435
Well, then, you know what?
I don't need to be here,

46:56.437 --> 46:59.440
- so enjoy your gutter balls.
- Hope...

47:09.418 --> 47:11.351
Should we still...

47:11.353 --> 47:13.153
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're bowling.

47:13.155 --> 47:16.388
She can have a pity party
all by herself.

47:16.390 --> 47:18.325
I'm sorry.

47:18.327 --> 47:20.895
I-I thought this would be fun.
Thank you for actually coming.

47:20.897 --> 47:22.730
No, my pleasure.
Thank you for having me.

47:22.732 --> 47:25.700
Nah, I had this big idea,

47:25.702 --> 47:29.336
'cause we used to come here all
the time when she was little.

47:29.338 --> 47:32.707
She loved it here, you know,
before all the...

47:32.709 --> 47:34.175
Yeah.

47:34.177 --> 47:35.810
It still has the same smell.

47:35.812 --> 47:37.578
You know, it's very, uh...
I don't know.

47:37.580 --> 47:39.279
Comforting? Old shoes.

47:40.583 --> 47:41.949
I get it.

47:41.951 --> 47:44.185
I like to go down to the river.

47:44.187 --> 47:45.887
Yeah, dead fish.

47:45.889 --> 47:47.589
- That's a comforting smell.
- No, not the dead fish.

47:47.591 --> 47:50.859
I-I watch for boats.

47:50.861 --> 47:52.794
- Boats.
- Yep.

47:52.796 --> 47:55.229
- Do we have boats on the river?
- Nope, we don't,

47:55.231 --> 47:57.265
but we do have
the second most drawbridges

47:57.267 --> 47:59.401
of any city in the world,
second to Amsterdam,

47:59.403 --> 48:00.402
but first in diversity.

48:00.404 --> 48:01.871
Ah. The more you know...

48:01.873 --> 48:03.939
I just completely
geeked out on you right now.

48:03.941 --> 48:06.541
I'm sorry. That's...
Just I'm from Rhode Island,

48:06.543 --> 48:08.577
and we have a rich
maritime tradition there...

48:08.579 --> 48:09.946
And I just said, "maritime."

48:09.948 --> 48:11.848
I don't know why
I'm rambling about boats.

48:13.318 --> 48:15.283
But I get it.

48:15.285 --> 48:16.788
Change can be hard.

48:18.389 --> 48:20.825
Yeah.
Hope's going through a lot.

48:21.994 --> 48:23.428
I meant for you.

48:25.998 --> 48:27.397
You know what's hard?

48:27.399 --> 48:28.665
What's that?

48:28.667 --> 48:30.333
That you're about to lose.

48:30.335 --> 48:32.402
Oh, my God.

48:32.404 --> 48:33.906
Okay. Let's see what you got.

48:39.244 --> 48:41.011
Good morning. I'm nurse Kelly.

48:41.013 --> 48:43.814
I'm going to be taking you down
to the operation today, okay?

48:43.816 --> 48:45.816
Can you tell me
your date of birth?

48:45.818 --> 48:48.787
8-30-1998.

48:48.789 --> 48:52.022
All right. And can you tell me
what you're having done today?

48:52.024 --> 48:56.728
An autologous hematopoiesis
cell transplantation.

48:56.730 --> 48:59.266
And can you tell me
your pain level?

49:04.403 --> 49:06.406
Okay. Thank you.

49:07.708 --> 49:09.641
All right. Let's go.

49:12.747 --> 49:15.880
I would love to see everybody
at the basketball game tonight.

49:15.882 --> 49:18.349
I can't promise you
an amazing game,

49:18.351 --> 49:21.319
but, as you know,

49:21.321 --> 49:24.323
the nachos are free
with your student I.D.

49:24.325 --> 49:26.492
Hey, hey, hey!

49:26.494 --> 49:28.629
The bell does not dismiss you.
I dismiss you.

49:31.032 --> 49:33.434
Okay, you can go. Hope.

49:39.474 --> 49:40.708
Proud of you.

49:41.910 --> 49:43.411
Hands to yourself, man.

49:45.881 --> 49:48.348
Look, if it's about the D,

49:48.350 --> 49:50.383
it's not gonna happen again.

49:50.385 --> 49:54.454
Hope, it's nothing
to do with the test.

49:54.456 --> 49:57.624
I and every other teacher
have let certain things slide.

49:57.626 --> 50:00.461
We've been grading you
based on your situation,

50:00.463 --> 50:01.796
and I know this is hard.

50:01.798 --> 50:03.430
I mean, I've been
in high school before.

50:03.432 --> 50:05.499
It can be very challenging
to navigate,

50:05.501 --> 50:08.703
but it doesn't benefit you
for you to keep thinking

50:08.705 --> 50:11.039
that you can be
this straight-A student

50:11.041 --> 50:13.043
if you're not putting forth
serious effort.

50:16.980 --> 50:19.649
I think you're capable
of more than you know.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.785
Come on.

50:22.787 --> 50:26.822
You kicked cancer's butt.

50:26.824 --> 50:30.025
So if there's anything I can do,
I'm happy to help in any way,

50:30.027 --> 50:31.962
but you gotta let me know.

50:38.703 --> 50:39.603
Hey.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.339
Watch it.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.877
Thanks so much.

50:56.421 --> 50:58.755
That's what you wanted,
to sit in this section?

50:58.757 --> 51:00.059
- Yeah.
- You want to sit here?

51:03.595 --> 51:06.096
So, uh, how's the boy thing
going right now?

51:06.098 --> 51:07.497
You seeing anyone?

51:07.499 --> 51:10.734
- No. I kind of want to...
- Yeah?

51:10.736 --> 51:11.969
but I'm not with anybody.

51:11.971 --> 51:13.737
Mm-hmm. How long
have you been single?

51:13.739 --> 51:16.540
- Do you know anyone?
- Um...

51:16.542 --> 51:18.876
So are you saying
Australians are good kissers?

51:18.878 --> 51:19.912
Yes.

51:22.182 --> 51:25.650
Seth, Seth, are you here?

51:33.560 --> 51:35.894
Come on. Pick up.
Please pick up.

51:35.896 --> 51:38.764
- Hey, you've reached Seth...
- Voicemail, okay.

52:13.769 --> 52:15.037
I'm pathetic.

52:29.885 --> 52:31.152
Well, where's Sarah?

52:31.154 --> 52:33.621
- She's already gone.
- What?!

52:33.623 --> 52:35.223
I'm sorry.
I just mean you missed her.

52:35.225 --> 52:37.558
She left for a procedure,
but I can't tell you for what.

52:37.560 --> 52:38.892
- Nurse Joyce, please...
- Ah-ah. As a nurse,

52:38.894 --> 52:40.862
I can't tell you
that information.

52:40.864 --> 52:43.466
I can't tell you that she's
downstairs going into surgery.

52:45.869 --> 52:47.602
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

52:47.604 --> 52:49.204
Don't tell 'em I told you that.

52:49.206 --> 52:51.105
- This is Helen.
- Where is Sarah?

52:51.107 --> 52:53.608
Well, she hasn't been responding
to any of my texts.

52:53.610 --> 52:55.811
She's in recovery.

52:55.813 --> 52:57.579
Wh-Why?

52:57.581 --> 53:00.117
She's had a pretty delicate
transplant procedure.

53:02.752 --> 53:04.954
Well, I-I have to see her.

53:04.956 --> 53:06.590
She's resting.

53:07.725 --> 53:09.892
Well, what can I do?

53:09.894 --> 53:12.931
Nothing. I have to go.

54:33.081 --> 54:34.049
Mom.

54:41.656 --> 54:42.590
Mom.

54:44.293 --> 54:45.194
Yeah?

54:46.929 --> 54:49.763
I'm sorry for how
I've been acting lately.

54:49.765 --> 54:51.333
You've been through so much.

54:53.302 --> 54:56.970
Half of me wants to tell you
that you don't ever

54:56.972 --> 54:59.675
have to apologize
for anything ever again.

55:02.413 --> 55:04.247
And the other half?

55:05.348 --> 55:07.217
You don't want to know.

55:11.154 --> 55:13.755
I'm gonna fix this.

55:13.757 --> 55:15.125
I promise.

55:16.793 --> 55:17.894
Okay.

55:24.836 --> 55:27.035
So my boyfriend is now dating

55:27.037 --> 55:28.437
the most popular girl in school,

55:28.439 --> 55:30.239
my two best friends hate me,

55:30.241 --> 55:32.274
I'm failing all my classes,

55:32.276 --> 55:34.176
and I'm sitting in a toilet

55:34.178 --> 55:37.914
where someone definitely
puked before, so that's great.

55:37.916 --> 55:40.149
This is my life now.
No more cupcakes,

55:40.151 --> 55:42.818
just toilet sandwiches.

55:42.820 --> 55:44.189
You get used to it.

55:45.324 --> 55:47.824
Thanks, but, um,

55:47.826 --> 55:50.893
I don't really
want to get used to it, so...

55:50.895 --> 55:53.130
Are you the girl who's dying?

55:53.132 --> 55:56.766
Yeah... maybe.

55:56.768 --> 55:58.068
No.

55:58.070 --> 56:00.704
Well, when I was
in the sixth grade,

56:00.706 --> 56:04.241
I got braces, orthopedic shoes,
scoliosis brace.

56:04.243 --> 56:06.076
My parents got divorced.

56:06.078 --> 56:09.380
It was... It was brutal, yeah.

56:10.917 --> 56:13.019
Okay, I'm coming out.
This is weird.

56:17.257 --> 56:18.890
Kids can be so mean.

56:18.892 --> 56:21.159
Or nice.

56:21.161 --> 56:23.328
It's just so random,

56:23.330 --> 56:26.066
like cancer or scoliosis.

56:27.400 --> 56:30.169
Look, I was such a big jerk,

56:30.171 --> 56:32.004
and I-I should
have stopped them,

56:32.006 --> 56:35.908
and I didn't, and I'm sorry.

56:35.910 --> 56:37.445
Thanks for that.

56:39.046 --> 56:40.948
But you can't just apologize.

56:42.249 --> 56:43.449
What do you mean?

56:43.451 --> 56:44.983
Who cares if you're sorry?

56:44.985 --> 56:46.852
You have to do something
about it.

56:46.854 --> 56:50.123
Yeah, you're right.

56:50.125 --> 56:55.828
Well, I go by Mildred,
Millie, with an IE.

56:55.830 --> 56:58.033
Hope, you know, like Obama.

56:59.535 --> 57:00.936
Sorry.

57:03.972 --> 57:06.005
My mom would love you.

57:06.007 --> 57:08.409
Gotta sanitize
if you want to fraternize.

57:08.411 --> 57:10.344
You know what I mean?

57:10.346 --> 57:12.246
That's nice.

57:12.248 --> 57:13.449
I like that.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.519
What's this?

57:18.521 --> 57:20.054
- It dries them.
- Oh.

57:20.056 --> 57:21.357
Gets the small a-goin'.

57:29.832 --> 57:31.399
I need you to guide me.

57:31.401 --> 57:32.967
The MCATs?

57:32.969 --> 57:35.170
Yes. I want to be
a pediatric oncologist.

57:35.172 --> 57:36.938
Are you out of your mind?

57:36.940 --> 57:38.939
Probably not even
gonna graduate high school.

57:38.941 --> 57:41.044
Do you have any doubt
I'm down for the impossible?

57:42.412 --> 57:43.812
I'm not a betting man.

57:43.814 --> 57:45.581
More of a board game man,
actually.

57:45.583 --> 57:48.084
- Eww.
- But if I was,

57:48.086 --> 57:51.052
I would definitely bet on you.

57:51.054 --> 57:54.256
Why don't we focus
on passing junior year first?

57:54.258 --> 57:56.259
And then we'll work
on the MCATs.

57:56.261 --> 57:57.593
Fine.

58:00.298 --> 58:01.367
You're welcome.

58:12.444 --> 58:14.411
Prometaphase...

58:14.413 --> 58:18.149
metaphase, um, anaphase...

58:27.025 --> 58:29.593
You know, your... your hands
really look like they're itching

58:29.595 --> 58:31.962
to cut up some zukes,
so why don't you...

58:31.964 --> 58:32.996
why don't you take over?

58:32.998 --> 58:35.466
Okay.

58:35.468 --> 58:37.902
I'm pretty good at this,
actually.

58:37.904 --> 58:39.604
And telophase.

58:44.611 --> 58:46.377
I'm sorry I'm late.

58:46.379 --> 58:48.614
Nearly 20 minutes late.
I can't give you the test.

58:48.616 --> 58:50.415
No, Mr. Baser, please.
I've studied. I'm ready.

58:50.417 --> 58:51.616
Just give me the test.

58:51.618 --> 58:54.252
School policy.

58:54.254 --> 58:56.555
Okay. You can't give it to me,

58:56.557 --> 58:58.590
but you can't stop me
from taking it.

58:58.592 --> 59:00.225
Hope, what are you...
what are you doing?

59:00.227 --> 59:01.994
You don't even have
the questions.

59:01.996 --> 59:03.995
Well, then I'll just have
to write down everything I know.

59:03.997 --> 59:04.931
What...?

59:07.034 --> 59:08.967
And everybody just keep
your eyes on your paper.

59:08.969 --> 59:09.870
Then we'll be good, right?

59:11.673 --> 59:13.308
Yeah.

59:16.344 --> 59:18.012
How'd the test go?

59:21.583 --> 59:23.683
Well, I probably got a C,
but I nailed the stuff

59:23.685 --> 59:25.318
on cancer cell growth.
So what's next?

59:25.320 --> 59:30.924
Next you have a test
on early American history.

59:30.926 --> 59:32.459
Quickly, name the first
five presidents.

59:32.461 --> 59:35.228
Monroe, Madison, Jefferson,
Adams, Washington.

59:35.230 --> 59:36.996
No, that's completely wrong.

59:36.998 --> 59:38.065
I said them in reverse.

59:38.067 --> 59:39.065
Why?

59:39.067 --> 59:40.302
Because I can.

59:44.407 --> 59:48.209
So Millie told me I can't
actually just say I'm sorry.

59:48.211 --> 59:49.711
I have to do something.

59:49.713 --> 59:51.379
I mean, she's right.

59:51.381 --> 59:54.415
And I think I have a plan.

59:54.417 --> 59:56.986
I just don't know whether
it's gonna work or not.

01:00:04.628 --> 01:00:07.329
Oh. Heh. Hey.

01:00:07.331 --> 01:00:09.264
Thanks for agreeing to meet.

01:00:09.266 --> 01:00:12.735
Yeah, sure. So you and Hope
are, like, friends now?

01:00:12.737 --> 01:00:14.438
I'm helping her.

01:00:16.173 --> 01:00:18.573
- Why?
- 'Cause she screwed up,

01:00:18.575 --> 01:00:21.544
but she's trying
to make it better.

01:00:21.546 --> 01:00:23.646
Where is she?

01:00:23.648 --> 01:00:27.282
Studying. You know,
she is so far behind.

01:00:27.284 --> 01:00:30.186
Yeah. I been trying to tell her
to study, actually.

01:00:30.188 --> 01:00:31.988
Well, at least
she's doing it now.

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.723
Yeah.

01:00:33.725 --> 01:00:36.493
Um, what I want to ask you

01:00:36.495 --> 01:00:39.762
is that, are you going
to Zoe's party this Friday?

01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:42.532
Yeah, of course.

01:00:42.534 --> 01:00:45.502
Hope's got something planned,
but we need your help.

01:00:45.504 --> 01:00:47.139
Can we count on you?

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.207
Yeah, I don't know about that.

01:00:50.209 --> 01:00:51.575
What do you mean?

01:00:51.577 --> 01:00:55.179
You guys are Hope and Seth,
Seth and Hope.

01:00:55.181 --> 01:00:56.781
Yeah, I just...
I don't really know

01:00:56.783 --> 01:01:00.219
how I, uh, feel about her
right now.

01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:04.223

to my party.

01:03:03.648 --> 01:03:06.349
Yeah, sure.

I don't know.

01:03:08.553 --> 01:03:10.353

Uh, no, still not...

Uh, you know, I don't know.

01:03:13.759 --> 01:03:17.761
I just... I kind of want her
to get it, you know, again.

01:03:17.763 --> 01:03:19.329
Cancer?

01:03:19.331 --> 01:03:21.565
You want her

No! What's wrong... No.

01:03:23.302 --> 01:03:25.536
I want her to, like,
understand what's important.

01:03:25.538 --> 01:03:29.573
Oh, that's hard. I gave up
on that, like, a year ago.

01:03:29.575 --> 01:03:30.909
You really like her.

01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:32.679
Of course. I mean...

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.480
she's my best friend.

You can't just use my TV.

01:04:38.981 --> 01:04:40.982

I used to date that girl!

01:04:56.901 --> 01:04:58.566
Shut up.

01:04:58.568 --> 01:05:00.803
You probably know me
as the girl who had cancer.

01:05:00.805 --> 01:05:03.905
Cancer and I were inseparable
since I was 12.

01:05:03.907 --> 01:05:06.374
At first, I was scared, and...

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:10.946
then something weird happened.

01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:12.448
It became familiar.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.482
I stopped hating it.

01:05:14.484 --> 01:05:17.886
It was really messed up,
but I-I started liking it.

01:05:17.888 --> 01:05:20.489
When I found out
I was in remission, I...

01:05:20.491 --> 01:05:23.693
I was scared and confused,
and I got angry that something

01:05:23.695 --> 01:05:26.996
that I had become so used to
was taken away from me,

01:05:26.998 --> 01:05:29.465
and I lost sight
of what really mattered...

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.000
my real friends and family.

01:05:31.002 --> 01:05:33.703
My best friend Sarah
still has cancer,

01:05:33.705 --> 01:05:37.041
and she's the best thing
that's ever happened to me,

01:05:37.043 --> 01:05:39.843
and I owe it to her
to figure life out.

01:05:39.845 --> 01:05:41.811
I'm sorry I lied.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:43.780
I never should have done that.

01:05:43.782 --> 01:05:46.917
I just wanted you guys
to like me more than anything,

01:05:46.919 --> 01:05:48.855
and that was my mistake...

01:05:50.022 --> 01:05:51.922
and I should have known better.

01:05:56.896 --> 01:05:58.429
How was it?

01:05:58.431 --> 01:06:00.033
Good job.

01:06:24.959 --> 01:06:26.825
Heh, Hey.

01:06:26.827 --> 01:06:28.929
Seth. Heh.

01:06:30.932 --> 01:06:33.132
So how was the party?

01:06:33.134 --> 01:06:34.934
Um, they kind of turned

01:06:34.936 --> 01:06:36.736
your death party
into a cupcake party.

01:06:36.738 --> 01:06:39.605
Can't believe
they actually did that.

01:06:39.607 --> 01:06:41.808
- I can, kinda.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:44.877
Zoe and Kai and all them are
kind of the worst people ever.

01:06:44.879 --> 01:06:46.679
Good cupcakes. Bad people.

01:06:46.681 --> 01:06:47.883
Yeah.

01:06:49.984 --> 01:06:53.787
I'm sorry I keep making you
sneak into places.

01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:55.122
No, you're not.

01:06:55.124 --> 01:06:56.490
Heh. No, I'm not.

01:06:56.492 --> 01:06:58.926
I'm not even a little bit.

01:06:58.928 --> 01:07:00.995
Hey, I mean,
at least you admit it.

01:07:00.997 --> 01:07:03.664
Well, you love it.
I mean, I get us into trouble.

01:07:03.666 --> 01:07:05.432
You get us out of trouble.

01:07:05.434 --> 01:07:07.868
Mm, the perfect team.

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:10.638
We kind of are, right?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.341
Yeah, we kind of are.

01:07:14.076 --> 01:07:17.113
So you don't... hate me?

01:07:19.015 --> 01:07:21.716
I don't hate you.

01:07:21.718 --> 01:07:22.886
Good.

01:07:24.654 --> 01:07:26.823
'Cause I couldn't stand it
if you hated me.

01:07:47.745 --> 01:07:49.112
Uh, visiting hours are over.

01:07:49.114 --> 01:07:50.646
But i-it's important,

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:52.548
like life-or-death important.

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:54.117
Her immune system is still weak.

01:07:59.892 --> 01:08:02.225
We know the drill.

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:05.629
You have ten minutes.

01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:06.997
When I come back to check

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:09.699
her blood pressure again,
you're gone.

01:08:09.701 --> 01:08:10.602
Thank you.

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.542
Sarah...

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:23.481
I'm so, so, so sorry.

01:08:23.483 --> 01:08:25.919
You mentioned that in the video.

01:08:27.586 --> 01:08:28.786
You watched it?

01:08:28.787 --> 01:08:31.555
I have an alert on your channel.

01:08:38.598 --> 01:08:40.966
I mean, could you
ever forgive me?

01:08:40.968 --> 01:08:42.267
And before you answer,
just know

01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:44.202
I plan on spending
the rest of my life

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.804
trying to make it up to you.

01:08:45.805 --> 01:08:49.843
Oddly, I kind of get it.

01:08:52.179 --> 01:08:58.084
You've always gotten it,
and I-I forgot. I forgot.

01:08:58.086 --> 01:09:01.688
I mean, I forgot you guys
are what make me special,

01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:06.027
not being popular or whatever.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:11.965
How was it, though,
being popular?

01:09:13.768 --> 01:09:16.071
It was not the worst thing...

01:09:18.274 --> 01:09:20.542
but it was so not worth it.

01:09:21.978 --> 01:09:24.714
I am so sorry I hurt you.

01:09:25.913 --> 01:09:27.615
Thank you.

01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:32.920
And it's the stupidest thing
i-in the history of the world

01:09:32.921 --> 01:09:35.555
that I'm in remission
and you're still sick,

01:09:35.558 --> 01:09:37.792
and I can't do this
if you're not here.

01:09:39.627 --> 01:09:40.796
Well, I'm still here.

01:09:43.966 --> 01:09:45.801
And I'm happy you're here, too.

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:54.909
I love you.

01:09:54.911 --> 01:09:57.078
I love you more.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.050
Not possible.

01:10:01.752 --> 01:10:03.785
Come on.

01:10:03.787 --> 01:10:07.622
You guys are gonna make me cry.
Come on.

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:10.026
"Hope springs eternal
in the human breast;

01:10:10.028 --> 01:10:12.895
Man never is,
but always to be blessed:

01:10:12.897 --> 01:10:15.965
The soul,
uneasy and confined from home,

01:10:15.967 --> 01:10:19.101
rests and expatiates
in a life to come."

01:10:19.103 --> 01:10:20.836
What I think that means

01:10:20.838 --> 01:10:22.838
is that there's always
a reason to be optimistic,

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.775
even though life
can be really hard,

01:10:25.777 --> 01:10:27.043
but you can get through it

01:10:27.045 --> 01:10:28.944
if you focus
on what really matters.

01:10:28.946 --> 01:10:31.915
Sarah got to reenroll in school
for the coming fall,

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:34.251
and Sarah's mom has been spending
more time at home with her.

01:10:34.253 --> 01:10:37.820
Mr. Garner is going to take us
on vacation to Rhode Island

01:10:37.822 --> 01:10:40.223
to look at boats,
ugh, which sounds lame,

01:10:40.225 --> 01:10:43.960
but if it makes them happy,
I'm happy.

01:10:43.962 --> 01:10:46.696
Millie doesn't have to eat
in the bathroom anymore.

01:10:46.698 --> 01:10:49.699
And Seth, Seth's Seth.

01:10:49.701 --> 01:10:51.635
Who knows what'll happen?

01:10:51.637 --> 01:10:53.670
And I am super
into my schoolwork

01:10:53.672 --> 01:10:55.273
and being stupid
with friends again.

01:10:55.275 --> 01:10:57.241
So that's the story
of how I learned

01:10:57.243 --> 01:10:59.143
to live life
without an expiration date.

01:10:59.145 --> 01:11:01.981
After all,
I was named Hope for a reason.
