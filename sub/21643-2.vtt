WEBVTT

00:10.043 --> 00:11.478
Good morning, everybody.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.146
Thanks for coming in early.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.547
[all] Boo!

00:16.149 --> 00:17.350
Yeah, fuck you, too.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.653
My son, of whom I'm very proud,

00:20.720 --> 00:23.022
wants to talk to you about his vision
for the store.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.125
[all] Boo!

00:25.191 --> 00:26.526
All right, guys, settle down.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.395
Carter, thank you for not booing.

00:28.461 --> 00:29.763
You have to care to boo.

00:31.664 --> 00:32.531
Goodbye.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.171
Guys, this is the first of what
I hope will be many staff meetings. I--

00:38.238 --> 00:40.106
Many? What, are you fucking kidding me?

00:41.574 --> 00:43.610
I'm sorry... continue.

00:45.111 --> 00:48.081
Well, as you know,
the cannabis industry is at a crossroads.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.048
You're losing them.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.186
Mr. Travis,
are there gonna be bathroom breaks?

00:53.253 --> 00:54.220
Yeah, I guess.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.825
Okay, I get it.
You don't wanna be here--

00:59.092 --> 01:00.160
Thank you.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.830
Oh, look who stayed.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.433
What does that mean? You stayed, too.

01:06.499 --> 01:10.103
Yeah, but I'm not trying
to make butterscotch babies with this one.

01:12.138 --> 01:12.806
[Doug] Where's Ruth?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.574
I need to talk to her now!

01:14.641 --> 01:16.843
[Carter] You will settle down, sir.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.079
[Doug] Ruth! I know you're here!

01:19.245 --> 01:22.382
[in Southern accent] If you'll excuse me,
it appears I have a gentleman caller.

I opened the door for business
and he barged in in his jammies.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.543
-It's called a gi.
-I don't care what it's called,

02:23.610 --> 02:25.411
you look like an asshole.

02:26.746 --> 02:27.814
Carter, be nice.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.749
Tae Kwon Doug is our next-door neighbor.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.385
My name is Douglas.

02:33.686 --> 02:34.621
I'm sorry.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.256
Tae Kwon Douglas.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.693
-Is this about me parking in your space?
-I don't care about the space.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.362
-I run here.
-Oh.

02:43.463 --> 02:45.365
You were a fat kid, weren't you?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.168
I was a little chubby, yeah.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.172
Look, I'm here on behalf

02:53.239 --> 02:55.742
of all the other storeowners
in the retail plaza.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.644
It's called a strip mall.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.614
See? And there we have it, don't we?
To us, it's a retail plaza

03:01.681 --> 03:04.617
where we make honest livings
as martial arts instructors,

03:04.684 --> 03:07.687
cold-pressed juicers,
and ethnic hair-care providers.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.392
But to you, no, it's just a strip mall
where it's perfectly fine

03:12.458 --> 03:14.294
-for your customers--
-They're patients.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.696
Oh. [chuckles] I'm so sorry.

03:16.763 --> 03:19.866
Your "patients"
to take their "medicine" out

03:19.933 --> 03:20.867
in our parking lot.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.202
Can you do those air quotes again?

03:23.269 --> 03:24.771
'Cause it's a perfect dick move.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.540
[Doug chuckles]

03:27.840 --> 03:29.576
You're a dick move! Okay.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.749
Look... families are the backbone
of our businesses here,

03:36.816 --> 03:40.253
and when families come here
and see people snarfing doobs, it's bad.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.654
Do you understand that?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.457
Look, Tae Kwon,
I understand your position,

03:44.524 --> 03:46.326
but it's established case law

03:46.392 --> 03:50.396
that a storeowner is not liable
for a customer's misuse of a product

03:50.463 --> 03:51.831
in an adjacent parking lot.

03:51.898 --> 03:56.970
And I would refer you to 2005's
Los Angeles County v. Hector's Dildos.

04:00.707 --> 04:04.644
That was where three men were caught
in a parking lot repeatedly--

04:04.711 --> 04:06.412
Spare me your dildos!

04:08.414 --> 04:10.350
Look, I have come here to notify you

04:10.416 --> 04:13.886
that, in concert with four other stores
and two-thirds of our kiosks,

04:13.953 --> 04:16.856
I have presented the landlord
with a formal complaint.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.260
Oh, no.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.363
Not just a complaint?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.032
A formal complaint?

04:29.002 --> 04:29.869
Oh, this is it.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.704
It's the big one.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.310
Lamont, when I'm dead,
keep the junkyard open.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.912
I'm coming, Elizabeth.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.047
I'm coming.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.489
Thanks for stopping by.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.594
We look forward
to addressing your concerns.

04:56.529 --> 04:59.499
Yeah, well...
you all don't deserve this, but, uh...

05:01.000 --> 05:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:09.409 --> 05:10.076
Okay.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.648
[Ruth] All right, show's over.

05:15.715 --> 05:16.816
Everybody back to work.

05:26.793 --> 05:27.894
So, about your mom...

05:29.595 --> 05:30.596
What the fuck?

05:32.465 --> 05:34.867
I've discussed this
with counselors and therapists.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.836
-They always say the same thing.
-What?

05:36.903 --> 05:37.837
"Our time is up."

05:39.806 --> 05:42.442
Well, I'd like her
to stay out of our business.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.610
Only one way to do that.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.346
Give her butterscotch grandbabies.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.084
That seems like a lot of effort.
But then again...

05:52.018 --> 05:53.453
she is the boss.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.654
Oh, hey. Hey.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.723
I don't take orders from my mom.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.126
Especially when it comes to the women
with whom I procreate.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.596
"With whom I procreate."

06:03.763 --> 06:06.632
-Proper grammar. Such a turn-on.
-Mm-hm.

06:07.066 --> 06:08.601
-That make you want me?
-Yeah.

06:08.668 --> 06:10.670
I mean, if it'll shut your mom up.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.505
Actually, you know, it's, um...

06:13.606 --> 06:14.907
-"shut up your mom."
-[chuckles]

06:15.908 --> 06:18.077
-Never split a phrasal verb.
-Shut up.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.886
-You free tonight?
-I am now.

06:34.927 --> 06:38.998
[narrator on TV]  This is going to be the
end of the road for so many of the salmon.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.467
The grizzly is extremely hungry...

06:41.901 --> 06:45.438
he hasn't tasted salmon in seven months,
and they fight...

06:47.140 --> 06:49.776
The longer the salmon takes
on their journey upstream,

06:49.942 --> 06:51.577
the weaker they become.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.013
The bears hold the high ground.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.583
The salmon makes high leaps
to see where the bears are.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.087
This mother bear has been waiting months
for this moment.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.890
Competition is fierce
for these first salmon...

07:03.956 --> 07:04.924
[announcer]  Lay's.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.592
You're gonna love this.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.195
It's my favorite indica. Very relaxing.

07:09.896 --> 07:12.198
[Jenny thinking]  That's right, Jenny.
You're totally relaxed.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.733
Just keep telling yourself that.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.501
Or better yet, tell your parents.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.470
[in Mandarin]
"Mom, Dad, good news!

07:17.537 --> 07:23.142
I'm totally relaxed 'cause I dropped out
of medical school to smoke and sell pot!"

07:23.209 --> 07:24.911
[in Mandarin]
Thank you, happy medicating!

07:27.613 --> 07:29.582
Jenny!

07:32.652 --> 07:33.519
Jenny.

07:33.686 --> 07:34.620
Jennifer.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.155
Janeefa. Ooh, I like that.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.723
That sounds African.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.794
Look at my man extrapolating, huh?

07:41.861 --> 07:43.463
Baby, I could do your name, too.

07:43.529 --> 07:44.797
Dabby. Daborah.

07:44.864 --> 07:45.765
Dabisha.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.068
Oh, not these fucksticks.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.773
-Ruth!
-Ruth!

07:53.840 --> 07:55.074
R-U-T-H.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.877
Are-You-T-H-seeing what I'm doing here?

07:59.579 --> 08:02.215
-That's crazy.
-He's the black Jamie Foxx.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.716
That's very real.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.984
-That's very real.
-Hey.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.552
-Hey.
-Tongue my tongue.

08:06.786 --> 08:07.753
[Ruth] No, no, no. Hey.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.590
Put those back in your mouths.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.125
-Ah, sorry, just--
-The two of us, when we're--

08:13.192 --> 08:16.562
-When we're together-- All we need is--
-It's just like we're-- We--

08:16.629 --> 08:19.966
-[Dabby] Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
-[Dank] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:20.032 --> 08:21.501
Yeah! Yeah!

08:22.001 --> 08:22.869
-Yeah!
-Oh!

08:23.536 --> 08:24.704
-Yeah!
-Aah!

08:29.575 --> 08:30.676
You know what we saying?

08:31.978 --> 08:33.078
Sadly, I do.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.116
Uh, look, I got a favor I gotta ask you.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.086
Favor. Favequa. Favante.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.888
[chuckles]

08:42.522 --> 08:44.123
-Shut the fuck up.
-[Dank] Okay.

08:45.758 --> 08:49.128
Look, Dank, Dabby, you know,
you're two of our best customers--

08:49.762 --> 08:52.598
-I thought we were patients.
-No, you're customers.

08:54.133 --> 08:57.670
And I appreciate your business,
but I just got a visit from Tae Kwon Doug,

08:57.737 --> 08:59.138
and... you and your friends,

08:59.205 --> 09:01.274
you're gonna have to stop smoking
in the parking lot.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.175
[both] Ah.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.677
Sure thing.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.078
Wink, wink. [chuckles]

09:06.946 --> 09:07.880
Yeah.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.649
Rip Van Winker.

09:09.715 --> 09:10.883
[Dabby chuckles]

09:10.950 --> 09:12.685
No, no, no. No, no, no.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.754
This isn't a wink thing. Really...

09:15.588 --> 09:16.756
don't do it.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.690
Understood?

09:18.124 --> 09:20.826
-Overstood.
-Yeah. We're way behind you.

09:23.162 --> 09:26.065
All right, let's see
if we can try a different approach.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.199
Uh, do you like stories?

09:27.266 --> 09:29.302
-We love stories.
-Yeah, they all right.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.271
Good. All right.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.007
Imagine you're a proud Italian-American...

09:35.641 --> 09:40.179
and you've devoted your life to fighting
against negative ethnic stereotypes,

09:40.246 --> 09:44.150
but there are these two idiots
who keep coming into your store

09:44.216 --> 09:45.217
saying things like,

09:45.284 --> 09:49.956
[in Italian accent] "Hey, bada-bing,
I like spaghetti and the meatballs."

09:50.022 --> 09:53.259
-Yeah.
-"I got a fucking monkey on my shoulder."

09:53.326 --> 09:54.994
[both laughing]

09:55.061 --> 09:57.897
-Oh, yeah.
-You--? You see where I'm going with this?

09:59.632 --> 10:00.299
No.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.973
You make our community look bad.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.308
You're  shondas  for the  goyim.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.611
You're the morons people point to

10:11.677 --> 10:14.814
when they say,
"People who smoke pot are morons."

10:16.182 --> 10:18.117
-Sorry, Ruth.
-Yeah, Ruth.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.219
We don't wanna be no  shondas.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.691
I know. I know you don't.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.960
I know you don't.
And I'm sorry I yelled at you.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.329
Jenny... give them a free joint.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.231
Bottom shelf.

10:34.266 --> 10:35.935
-[Dabby] Thanks, Ruth.
-[Dank] Yeah, thanks, Ruth.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.103
-Here you go.
-[Dank] Heh.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.406
Thank you. Come on.
Let's go spark that up in the parking lot.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.242
All right.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.144
Thank you, baby.

10:52.351 --> 10:55.221
Hello and welcome to Strain O' the Day.

10:55.755 --> 10:56.889
You know, for me,

10:56.989 --> 11:00.092
one of the most exciting things
about working in the cannabis space

11:00.159 --> 11:03.329
is the opportunity it affords
female entrepreneurs.

11:03.696 --> 11:07.199
Which brings me to today's strain.
Eve's Bush.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.972
[Jenny] Eve's Bush
is the only strain of marijuana

11:13.039 --> 11:15.841
guaranteed to never have been touched
by male hands.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.810
From seed to pipe,

11:17.877 --> 11:20.713
no creature with a Y chromosome
has ever penetrated

11:20.780 --> 11:23.182
the horticultural hymen of this bud.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.787
I've known the women
who run Eve's Bush Farm

11:27.853 --> 11:28.921
for over 30 years,

11:28.988 --> 11:32.691
and I can attest to the militancy
and virulence of their lesbianism.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.361
They hate men.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.328
They just do.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.932
Eve's Bush is the perfect choice,

11:39.999 --> 11:42.001
whether you wanna reconnect
with your inner goddess

11:42.068 --> 11:43.436
or just scissor with your bestie.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.274
Eve's Bush is available at 45 an eighth,

11:48.340 --> 11:51.744
but we're offering
a special 25 percent discount

11:51.811 --> 11:54.847
for every marginalized group
to which you belong.

11:55.848 --> 11:59.485
So, if you're a disabled,
transgender Latina, you smoke free.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.022
Eve's Bush.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.490
Put your mouth on it.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.166
Hey,
you gonna be at the apartment tonight?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.801
Yeah, probably when I get home.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.273
Okay, well, uh, just a heads-up,
I may be having someone over.

12:21.907 --> 12:22.775
A guest.

12:23.075 --> 12:23.943
Olivia?

12:24.877 --> 12:26.112
Why would you say Olivia?

12:26.178 --> 12:27.880
Because you said "guess," so I did.

12:29.381 --> 12:32.151
-No, I said "guest."
-Oh.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.053
Who's the guest?

12:36.021 --> 12:37.456
-It's Olivia.
-Oh, cool.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.058
So, I guessed right.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.527
I think you guys would be good together.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.963
You sound
like you've been talking to my mom.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.831
Yeah, we talk about you all the time.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.334
She's concerned
you're not having enough sex.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.035
Oh, God.

12:50.102 --> 12:50.970
I am, too.

12:51.137 --> 12:54.039
A young man like you
should be having regular orgasms.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.774
If not for you, for your prostate.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.279
-Good to know.
-And it's not just about the orgasms,

13:00.346 --> 13:04.083
it's the emotional intimacy that
can only come when genitals hold hands.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.819
I'm gonna go, Pete.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.054
All right.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.557
-Hey, Travis?
-Yeah?

13:12.791 --> 13:13.459
Just remember...

13:14.360 --> 13:18.397
when two people love each other...
there are no wrong holes.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.140
Thank you.

13:29.108 --> 13:29.975
Welcome.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.145
Thank you. Have a wonderful day.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.655
[both laughing]

14:58.664 --> 14:59.531
[announcer]  Lay's.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.638
Are you lights-on or lights-off?

15:06.272 --> 15:09.308
Actually, Alexa,
dim bedroom lights 50 percent.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.644
[Alexa]  Dim bedroom lights to 50 percent.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.612
Oh, this is like a three-way.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.181
Nobody here but me and you.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.254
Jesus, Travis, you're going at her
like that stuffed rabbit

15:22.321 --> 15:23.989
you used to hump when you were 13.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.093
I'll get it.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.430
Whoa, look at those childbearing hips.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.999
It's like a grandbaby superhighway.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.568
Who the hell are you?

15:37.469 --> 15:39.004
I'm the Ruth in Olivia's head.

15:39.071 --> 15:42.675
Well, I'm the Ruth in Travis' head
and I don't need your help.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.443
What's your problem?

15:44.510 --> 15:46.578
You just reminded her
she might get pregnant.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.347
Goodbye, lady boner.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.283
-Don't you want her to get pregnant?
-I do,

15:51.350 --> 15:53.218
but they gotta think it was their idea.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.421
Come on, Travis.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.590
-Do it for Momma! Make me proud!
-Come on, Olivia.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.526
-Do this for me.
- Travis! Travis! Travis!

16:00.592 --> 16:01.627
Let's go all the way.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.596
-Who's my great, big boy?
-I wanna be your mother-in-law.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.699
[singing "Hava Nagila"]

16:11.203 --> 16:13.072
Sorry. I'm just a little...

16:13.639 --> 16:14.974
Distracted?

16:15.741 --> 16:17.209
-Yeah.
-Yeah, me, too.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.479
You wanna go get a ramen or something?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.015
Yeah, that sounds good.

16:25.451 --> 16:29.254
Great. Now they're gonna go get
something called a "ramen."

16:29.688 --> 16:31.690
They're Japanese noodles,
you ignorant fuck.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.526
We gonna do this thing?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.729
Any time, any place.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.134
We could just light up.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.070
-Always a good idea.
-Yeah.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.307
[Alexa]  I would like some as well.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.555
[laughing]

17:09.428 --> 17:10.396
[announcer]  Lay's.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.433
-YouTube!
-YouTube!

17:14.500 --> 17:17.202
I tube. We all tube for ice cream.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.337
[both laugh]

17:18.404 --> 17:19.338
Hi, I'm Dank.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.672
And I'm Dabby,

17:20.739 --> 17:25.344
and you're watching Dank and Dabby,
the channel by stoners, for stoners--

17:25.411 --> 17:26.545
And by stoners!

17:26.612 --> 17:27.579
[Dabby laughs]

17:27.646 --> 17:29.581
This is a very special episode.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.050
Our long-time fans know

17:31.116 --> 17:34.353
what we like to do on this show
is smoke enormous amounts of marijuana.

17:34.420 --> 17:39.191
Yeah. It's a deceptively simple premise
and we got it copyrighted.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.827
But today is different.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.630
Social justice cannot wait for us
to get high.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.232
And I can't wait for us to get high
either.

17:47.499 --> 17:51.503
This nice woman
is Ruth Whitefeather Feldman.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.841
Owner of Ruth's Alternative Caring
and an American hero.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.511
A word that's overused
and I use it constantly.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.247
Yeah.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.750
Ruth is like a real cool
fourth-grade teacher

18:04.817 --> 18:07.686
who cares about you
and uses rap to teach you math.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.620
Yeah.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.123
And also sells you hella pot.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.662
Yesterday, we found out
that Ruth is getting man-hassled--

18:16.728 --> 18:17.596
Massled.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.634
-Yeah.
-Boy...

18:23.535 --> 18:25.137
how do you do that?

18:26.505 --> 18:28.340
It's a gift and a curse, boo.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.409
It's a gurse.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.478
[both laughing]

18:32.544 --> 18:33.779
Oh, my God.

18:34.713 --> 18:38.684
Your-- Your shit, it's got levels, man.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.685
Yeah, yeah.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.389
It's like a-- It's like a cake.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.525
Oh, yeah, a level cake!

18:46.592 --> 18:48.427
-It's like a cake.
-Oh, God.

18:48.494 --> 18:53.699
Okay, okay, so, Ruth is getting massled...

18:54.166 --> 18:58.137
by some judo dick who says
we can't light up in the parking lot.

18:58.203 --> 19:01.373
Um, hey, asshole, it's legal now.

19:01.440 --> 19:05.677
Ever hear of a little something
called the U.S.S. Constitution?

19:07.546 --> 19:09.248
And it was written on hemp.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.817
George Washington's quote-unquote "farm."

19:11.884 --> 19:14.386
That motherfucker grew slaves.

19:17.289 --> 19:20.792
Well, we love Ruth,
and we want Ruth to love us back.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.928
So, we made a very detailed plan.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.363
And so... [clears throat]

19:26.632 --> 19:27.599
Shit.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.937
-It's okay. I got it, lover.
-Okay.

19:33.472 --> 19:37.910
Tomorrow night, weed enthusiasts
of all races, religions

19:38.177 --> 19:39.578
and streaming services

19:39.645 --> 19:43.916
shall assemble at the parking lot
outside of Ruth's Alternative Caring and--

19:44.183 --> 19:47.519
...exercise our right to get high!

19:47.586 --> 19:48.820
[all] Woo!

19:48.887 --> 19:52.891
Where we want,
when we want and how we want!

19:52.958 --> 19:54.626
[reggae music playing over speakers]

19:54.693 --> 19:55.727
Can I Tase a couple?

19:56.962 --> 19:57.930
-No.
-Please?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.698
Just one white kid with dreadlocks?

20:01.567 --> 20:04.503
-[Jenny] This is really badass.
-[Carter] This is gonna get ugly.

20:04.570 --> 20:08.607
If only someone we knew had a history of
addressing large crowds of angry stoners.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.443
Wait a minute, Ruth does.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.346
[Ruth] Can I have your attention,
everybody?

20:15.914 --> 20:19.284
Can somebody please turn off
the elevator reggae?

20:19.351 --> 20:20.586
[music stops]

20:21.220 --> 20:21.887
Thank you.

20:21.987 --> 20:24.756
Hi, I'm Ruth Whitefeather Feldman.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.358
Go get them, Ruth!

20:27.626 --> 20:29.494
Maria? What are you doing here?

20:29.561 --> 20:30.829
Hanging with my peeps!

20:31.797 --> 20:33.699
Your peeps are your children.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.836
Not tonight.
They're at Mommy and Me with the nanny!

20:38.503 --> 20:40.973
Okay, you and I are gonna talk later.

20:41.306 --> 20:42.774
One-on-one, okay?

20:43.275 --> 20:44.276
Privately.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.311
As for the rest of you...

20:46.378 --> 20:48.513
nobody loves marijuana more than me.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.514
[all] Woo!

20:49.581 --> 20:51.283
Ever since I was a young woman,

20:51.717 --> 20:54.586
I've made it my mission
to legalize marijuana.

20:55.887 --> 20:56.755
For God's sake.

20:57.389 --> 21:00.926
You don't have to yell "woo"
every time I say "marijuana."

21:00.993 --> 21:02.294
[all] Woo!

21:02.361 --> 21:04.363
All right, fine. I won't anymore.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.297
I will.

21:05.631 --> 21:06.865
Marijuana!

21:06.932 --> 21:08.600
[all] Woo!

21:08.667 --> 21:10.902
Dabby, swear to God,
I will punch you right in the tits.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.304
Oh.

21:12.704 --> 21:13.905
Please, everybody,

21:13.972 --> 21:16.008
I really appreciate your support,

21:16.642 --> 21:20.312
but the thing to do now
is go home before the cops show up.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.280
Too late!

21:21.680 --> 21:23.548
The police are already on their way.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.484
You brought this on yourself, Ruth.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.886
You and all these degenerate Cheech and--

21:28.553 --> 21:30.555
[groans] I'm blanking, the other one.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.661
Uh, Doug, I'm trying
to clear everybody out.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.296
Okay? Just be cool.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.463
I am cool.

21:38.730 --> 21:39.598
You know why?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.932
'Cause I don't take pot.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.403
Pot... is lame.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.704
[all gasp]

21:47.005 --> 21:50.742
Rosita, there are juice boxes
in Brynn's backpack.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.081
You can insult me all you want...

21:57.449 --> 21:59.851
-when you insult marijuana--
-[all] Woo!

21:59.918 --> 22:01.386
Stop it!

22:03.522 --> 22:04.589
--it gets personal.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.325
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

22:06.391 --> 22:07.993
What are you gonna do about it?

22:09.861 --> 22:11.863
Well, I guess there's nothing I can do
about it.
