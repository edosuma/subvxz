He is on the plane.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.201

We got an agent on Flight 127?

33:58.162 --> 34:00.247
VICK:
He's one of the passengers.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.916
-We verified his identity?
-Headquarters did the vetting.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.043
He sent this message:

34:05.127 --> 34:06.795
"Four attackers, two guns.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.214
"Children in first class, rest in econ.

in any counterinsurgency.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.864

less than their demands.

Never. They'll kill themselves

The Germans are sending
their prisoners here to Vienna,

35:02.351 --> 35:04.520

-Thinks it's political suicide.

They're gonna play tough, particularly now
the Germans aren't bending.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.028
OWEN: So if the Germans and Austrians
won't give in to the demands,

35:13.111 --> 35:15.113
our only option is to storm the plane.

35:15.197 --> 35:18.534
No, no, no, no.
W-We're not storming anything.

35:18.617 --> 35:23.330
