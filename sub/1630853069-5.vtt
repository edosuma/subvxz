WEBVTT

00:07.741 --> 00:09.843
Blackbeard:
What we have here is
a medium-sized merchant craft.

00:09.909 --> 00:12.412
You'll note,
if you look carefully,

00:12.512 --> 00:14.314
a distinct
lack of cannons

00:14.381 --> 00:16.316
or any other
killing devices.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.384
So, we're gonna
go on up there,

00:17.484 --> 00:18.385
and, uh, we're gonna
cause some havoc.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.021
Izzy:
Crew of "Revenge,"
you are not to engage.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.555
You are simply
here to observe
how real pirates

00:22.655 --> 00:25.692
function in
the real world.

00:25.759 --> 00:30.230
Uh, we are also real pirates
in the real world, so.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.334
Quick question:
how violent do we
expect this to get?

00:34.401 --> 00:35.435
-Blackbeard: Go, go, go!
-(intense music playing)

00:35.535 --> 00:39.205
-(screams)
-(grunts)

00:43.743 --> 00:45.078
(screams)

00:45.178 --> 00:48.581
Isn't this terrifying?
Note the gusto, Lucius.

00:48.681 --> 00:50.016
-The what?!
-The gusto!

00:50.083 --> 00:52.752
-Why aren't you taking notes?
-Oh no!

00:52.852 --> 00:53.853
(yells)

00:54.754 --> 00:57.023
(jaunty tune playing)

01:01.061 --> 01:04.197
It's been an extraordinary
few days of training
with Blackbeard's crew.

01:04.264 --> 01:06.366
-'Scuse me, lads.
-Captain Stede: Oh, hello, Ivan.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.734
-Lucius: Hi, Ivan.
-Hello.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.202
Have you checked
his body yet or what?

01:09.269 --> 01:11.638
Oh, hadn't even
occurred to me.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.908
Lucius, write that down in
the "Useful Tips" section.

01:14.974 --> 01:17.477
Searching bodies, wow!

01:17.577 --> 01:20.480
Hey, also,
I call dibs on
any gold teeth.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.581
Oh, look at that.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.483
They waste nothing.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.819
Who knew there was
so much to learn
about pirating?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.987
<i>I've made so much progress,</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:29.656
<i>but the number of bad</i>
<i>habits I've identified is,</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:31.891
<i>frankly, humbling.</i>

01:33.226 --> 01:35.628
-It's another keeper.
-What are you doin'?

01:35.728 --> 01:37.831
I-I'm just looting
this library,

01:37.931 --> 01:41.568
but I'm replacing
all the books I've looted
with ones I've already read.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.838
Yeah, that's... that's not
how looting works, mate.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.639
-That's a keeper.
-(book clatters)

01:47.240 --> 01:48.475
Seriously, stop it.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.511
Hand over the goods, dear boy,

01:51.611 --> 01:54.147
or I'll be obliged
to unleash my vengeance...

01:54.247 --> 01:57.984
which will be
quite unfortunate
for both of us:

01:58.084 --> 02:00.186
the vengeancer
and the vengeancee.

02:01.921 --> 02:01.988
No.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.459
Oh, he's not cooperating.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.827
How do I be more
scary than that?

02:07.927 --> 02:09.195
You could try
a little more oomph.

02:11.164 --> 02:13.666
Next one goes through
your fuckin' eyeball!

02:13.766 --> 02:15.869
Now, where's the loot?!
Where's the fuckin' loot?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.504
Captain:
(speaking French)

02:17.604 --> 02:18.671
(inaudible)

02:21.674 --> 02:23.009
See? Oomph.

02:26.045 --> 02:28.882
Captain Stede:
<i>And I like to think I've shown</i>
<i>him a thing or two as well.</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:31.050
Now, the most important
rule with cutlery...

02:31.151 --> 02:33.520
always work your way
from the outside in

02:33.620 --> 02:36.022
after you've dealt
with these smaller pieces
in the middle here.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.725
-So, we've got
the caviar spoon...
-Yep.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.127
...escargot fork, lobster fork.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.963
-What's escargot?
-Uh, that's snail.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.865
Mm, the French
love the snails.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.735
-Yeah, kind of,
but more of a scoop.
-Snails.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.970
Back to the outside,
and in we go with

02:51.037 --> 02:53.673
-salad fork--
-I learn all of this
just to fucking eat?

02:53.740 --> 02:56.576
Yes, oh, but it's
not just eating.
We're dining.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.745
And remember,
dining is...

02:58.845 --> 03:00.213
-Pageantry.
-Pageantry.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.981
I'd love to show you
some saucier spoons,

03:02.048 --> 03:04.384
but there appears
to be a distinct
lack of those on

03:04.484 --> 03:06.753
this, supposedly,
first-class vessel.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.557
My apologies.
Hadn't imagined we'd
be hosting your kind.

03:12.158 --> 03:13.159
What kind?

03:14.494 --> 03:15.895
What's that supposed to mean?

03:15.995 --> 03:17.830
It means a rich donkey

03:17.897 --> 03:19.532
is still a donkey.

03:23.069 --> 03:26.706
A donkey?
A fucking donkey?!

03:26.773 --> 03:28.408
(shouts):
A fucking donkey?!

03:28.508 --> 03:29.542
Do you know
where I'm from?!

03:29.609 --> 03:32.011
You know fucking
nothing about me, mate!

03:32.078 --> 03:34.781
I've got more riches
than you can shake
a fucking stick at!

03:34.881 --> 03:36.249
Just ignore him, Ed!

03:36.349 --> 03:38.218
Don't debase yourself
for a man who

03:38.284 --> 03:40.787
hasn't a single
tureen on board.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.457
You're right.
No need to get riled.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.728
-Fang...
-Fang: Yeah?

03:48.795 --> 03:51.564
lash him to
something very heavy,
and toss him overboard.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.099
And Fang?

03:55.702 --> 03:56.769
Skin him first...

03:58.871 --> 04:01.207
and use the snail fork.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.477
(fork clatters)

04:05.878 --> 04:06.879
Oh...

04:06.946 --> 04:08.548
Now, where were we?

04:08.615 --> 04:11.551
Captain Stede:
The melon spoon is, is, uh,

04:11.618 --> 04:12.819
something I didn't
mention earlier,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.255
which, which,
obviously...

04:15.321 --> 04:18.925
is, uh...
is for melons.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.127
Blackbeard's Mother:
<i>Feel it, boy.</i>

04:21.227 --> 04:24.163
<i>The Carmody Estate is</i>
<i>full of things like this.</i>

04:25.465 --> 04:26.799
Beautiful things.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.337
Why can't we have
things like this?

04:32.739 --> 04:34.440
Well, it's not
up to us, is it?

04:34.507 --> 04:36.075
It's up to God.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.810
He decides
who gets what.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.581
We're just not
those kind of people.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.318
<i>We never will be.</i>

04:45.418 --> 04:47.253
(pensive music playing)

04:49.922 --> 04:52.158
Captain Stede:
Edward?

04:52.258 --> 04:54.360
-Yeah? Yeah.
-Everything all right?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.995
I couldn't help but
notice that that captain

04:56.095 --> 04:57.130
got under your skin.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.532
What? No.

04:59.632 --> 05:00.867
Okay.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.102
His words, though...

05:03.169 --> 05:06.005
They sounded polite,
but they stung.

05:06.105 --> 05:10.009
Yeah... that's called
"passive aggression."

05:10.109 --> 05:12.211
Pirates,
they attack with force.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.380
The upper crust, they strike

05:14.480 --> 05:18.451
with cutting remarks
disguised as politeness.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.286
That's fucking diabolical.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.623
-It is.
-Good day to you, fine sirs.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.625
What do you think?
A couple of the suits

05:25.692 --> 05:26.526
from the fancy ship
didn't have blood on them,

05:26.626 --> 05:28.561
and weren't burned up,
so I nabbed 'em,

05:28.661 --> 05:30.330
and I found this.

05:30.396 --> 05:34.701
It's a invitation
to some kind of fancy party
for hoity-toity people.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.202
Oh, well, we won't
be needing that.

05:36.302 --> 05:37.637
Frenchie:
No? I'll burn it then.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.372
No-- (stammering)
Hey, stop. Hang on.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.208
-I don't care, but... yeah.
-Want to look at it?

05:42.308 --> 05:44.243
-Very well. Let's have a look.
-Have a read.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.682
It's addressed to
"Sir Godfrey Thornrose."

05:50.817 --> 05:51.551
Even the name's annoying.

05:51.651 --> 05:55.054
Oh yeah.
he's been invited
to some...

05:55.154 --> 05:58.491
stuffy, swanky
formal affair tonight.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.259
-Ooh, lame.
-Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.595
-Don't wanna go to that.
-Frenchie: Yeah.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.897
Yeah, but, I mean,
fuck I care. Whatever.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.900
But we may as well,
maybe, just go.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.570
Give me a chance to practice
my massive aggression.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.606
-Passive aggression.
-Passive aggression. I know.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.241
Well, I think you'll hate it.
It's just a whole bunch of

06:15.341 --> 06:19.078
posh nobs hobnobbing
with other posh nobs,

06:19.178 --> 06:21.514
drinking champagne,
and exchanging glances,

06:21.581 --> 06:23.583
and talking
about nonsense.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.051
Fashion, all that kind of stuff.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.019
-Yeah.
-We're going.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.121
What're you doing tonight?

06:28.221 --> 06:31.124
-Nothing. No.
-Nothing? Let's do it.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.361
(indistinct chatter)

06:35.428 --> 06:37.363
-(shushing)
-(whispers): Shut the-- Shut up.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.632
Black Pete:
I'm, I'm trying
to be quiet.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.634
You good?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.704
I'm good.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.576
Oh, be a dear,
and make me one
of those, would ya?

06:50.643 --> 06:52.545
No, shut up.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.614
Get back to work now,
all of ya.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.115
We are working...

06:56.215 --> 06:59.819
We just took stock
of the rations.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.954
Of the rations, yeah,
and it turns out we are...

07:02.054 --> 07:04.590
-(knocks) good.
-Very good, actually.

07:04.657 --> 07:08.060
-Yeah, we all heard you.
-Yeah, we love an audience.

07:08.127 --> 07:11.597
Oh, I see.
You think you're cute?

07:11.664 --> 07:13.299
Actually, I think
I'm just so-so,

07:13.399 --> 07:16.302
-but I've decided to carry
myself like I'm cute.
-(laughs)

07:16.402 --> 07:19.806
-Black Pete: Worked on me.
-(chuckles) Ooh.

07:19.906 --> 07:23.309
(forced giggling)

07:25.445 --> 07:29.315
Ooh, ooh, Daddy.

07:29.415 --> 07:30.249
Daddy.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.590
Your lot days
of lyin' around doing
fuck-all, it's through.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.160
You're all gettin'
specific duties.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.329
No thanks, Iggy.
I only take orders
from my Captain.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.201
My name is Mr. Hands,
First Mate Hands,

07:48.301 --> 07:50.503
or God, as far as
you're concerned.

07:50.603 --> 07:54.273
And I've got just
the job for you...
bitch.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.543
-Follow me.
-Yep, absolutely.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.511
Come on.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.214
...little psycho.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.216
-Um.
-Hey!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.350
-This was fun.
-This was so fun.

08:04.450 --> 08:08.054
-Izzy (screams): Now!
-Yeah, okay.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.556
(light classical music playing)

08:12.291 --> 08:13.826
Here we are, gents.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.461
Polite culture, ho.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.065
Oh,<i> bonjour.</i>

08:19.165 --> 08:22.735
Uh, Sir Godfrey Thornrose.

08:22.835 --> 08:27.006
-And this is...
-Jeff... the accountant.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.574
You know you can
pick anythin', right?

08:28.674 --> 08:29.876
Yeah, and I like
the name Jeff,

08:29.976 --> 08:31.744
and accounting
sounds fancy as fuck.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.379
-All right.
-And these are...

08:33.479 --> 08:37.583
-Oh... these are--
-You have the honor...

08:37.683 --> 08:41.320
of addressing
the Crown Prince Azi of Egypt.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.022
Please.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.492
Thank you. (clears throat)
And I am his viceroy.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.264
-Oluwande: Please.
-Please, please.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.232
Oluwande:
What does a viceroy do?

08:53.332 --> 08:55.067
Whatever the fuck
he wants, babe.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.236
Oh, Gaston!

09:00.273 --> 09:03.910
Well, here it is.
High society in all
its grotesque glory.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.245
(high-pitched laughter)

09:06.345 --> 09:08.080
(classical music plays)

09:09.115 --> 09:10.216
(laughs)

09:10.283 --> 09:11.751
If you're feeling
overwhelmed,

09:11.851 --> 09:13.386
we can always
go back to the ship.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.022
No. Jeff never turns
his back on a challenge.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.791
Jeff would sooner die.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.927
And how does one
win this interaction?

09:21.027 --> 09:22.128
Win?

09:23.029 --> 09:24.964
Well, I've never really--

09:25.064 --> 09:28.267
I suppose you win
if all of these people
find you charming.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.469
Well, what's
the first step of that?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.573
Maybe a witty anecdote?

09:33.639 --> 09:35.875
Something funny
that might've happened
to you at some point?

09:37.209 --> 09:38.578
Oh, there was one time
I was gouging an eye out

09:38.644 --> 09:39.278
of this lad's skull,
and, uh--

09:39.378 --> 09:42.415
I'm gonna
stop you there.

09:42.481 --> 09:45.284
It's not really
the, uh, crowd
for skull talk.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.954
-Come on.
-Check out this heisting.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.121
Gabriel:
<i>Pardonne-moi.</i>

09:49.221 --> 09:52.258
But there is
a vicious rumor
going around

09:52.325 --> 09:56.128
that you are...
Sir Godfrey Thornrose?

09:56.729 --> 09:59.265
Ah, yes.
Yes, I am.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.467
Not "the"
Sir Godfrey Thornrose?

10:01.567 --> 10:05.638
-Guilty.
-The master phrenologist,

10:05.738 --> 10:08.307
Sir Godfrey Thornrose?

10:08.407 --> 10:11.110
-Are they deaf? Are you deaf?
-Indeed, I am.

10:11.177 --> 10:15.481
-We are huge fans of your work.
-Huge fans.

10:15.581 --> 10:21.287
-Oh.
-Would you be willing...
to... palpitate my wife?

10:21.354 --> 10:23.089
Oh, that was fast.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.357
Please...

10:25.691 --> 10:26.325
This head is yours.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.160
Gabriel:
Ah, everyone, everyone!

10:28.260 --> 10:29.495
Sir Godfrey Thornrose

10:29.595 --> 10:33.499
is going to palpitate
Antoinette in the parlor,

10:33.599 --> 10:35.868
-and everyone shall watch!
-(laughs)

10:35.968 --> 10:38.771
-(excited chatter)
-(applause)

10:38.838 --> 10:40.706
May I just say, Prince,

10:40.806 --> 10:45.177
you and your employee
are two of the cleanest,

10:45.277 --> 10:47.513
most well-spoken Africans

10:47.613 --> 10:49.782
-I have ever had
the pleasure to meet.
-Oh, wow.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.651
-What?
-What a lovely thing to say.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.520
If only I can get my Africans

10:54.620 --> 10:56.889
to present with your bearing.

10:56.989 --> 11:01.527
Stand up straight, Abshir!
Take a lesson from these two!

11:01.627 --> 11:03.362
Now, now don't be
too hard on the lad.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.564
Not everyone can be
the Big Dog Prince Azi here.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.035
He's the descendant
of a fabulously
wealthy pharaoh.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.569
Siegfried:
Ah, (speaking French)

11:10.670 --> 11:12.471
Y-Yes... that's
correct, correct.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.507
Unfortunately,
tragedy recently befell

11:14.573 --> 11:17.176
-his massive fortune.
-(gasps)

11:17.243 --> 11:18.577
Frenchie:
It's locked away
in a remote pyramid,

11:18.678 --> 11:20.746
and I shouldn't be
saying this, should I?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.548
-Um... no.
-I apologize, or should I?

11:22.648 --> 11:23.749
-Yes.
-I don't know, I probably
shouldn't, should I?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.151
-Should I? Eh?
-You-- Okay.

11:25.217 --> 11:27.553
Ah, to hell with it.
Siegfried gets us.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.089
So, we've a scheme
to retrieve the wealth.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.192
-Siegfried: Mm-hm.
-But we need the right
business partner,

11:33.259 --> 11:36.662
who, of course, stands
to become insanely wealthy.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.864
Are you that kind of person?

11:38.931 --> 11:42.568
(lively music playing)

11:42.668 --> 11:47.273
Uh, so, uh, phrenology,
which is the study
of the human head.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.742
Feeling here...

11:49.842 --> 11:56.215
I can tell that
Antoinette is of...
Dutch descent?

11:56.282 --> 11:58.217
-(all gasp)
-No, I'm Prussian.

11:58.284 --> 12:01.053
Wow, I killed a Prussian once.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.458
Excuse me?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.593
In self-defense.

12:10.696 --> 12:14.533
Sometimes...
a quick death's the best way
to end a bad conversation.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.206
-(Antoinette laughs)
-(all laughing)

12:21.874 --> 12:26.112
-This man is
absolutely hilarious!
-(laughter continues)

12:26.212 --> 12:28.547
And fascinating.

12:29.949 --> 12:34.120
Wait 'til you hear
about my life...
as an accountant.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.821
(laughing)

12:39.091 --> 12:41.660
This is far too fast.
This is far too fast.
This is far too fast...

12:41.761 --> 12:45.998
Oh god! Oh shit!
I just tweaked my lower back.

12:46.098 --> 12:49.468
I expect this
to be done by sunset.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.470
I hope you know how
bad this is for my hands.

12:51.570 --> 12:52.805
Captain Bonnet'll
have your head

12:52.905 --> 12:56.075
if my calligraphy's
negatively impacted in any way!

12:56.142 --> 12:59.311
This is deranged!
I don't clean things!

13:00.246 --> 13:01.480
Oh...

13:01.580 --> 13:03.916
-He's gone, mate.
-Oh, Fang, thank god!

13:03.983 --> 13:05.484
Okay, can you
haul me up, please?
Come on.

13:05.584 --> 13:06.452
Yeah, nah.
I'm supposed to watch,

13:06.519 --> 13:09.088
and make sure you do
all this and that.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.257
Yeah, totally.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.197
Has anyone ever told you
you have stunning cheekbones?

13:18.297 --> 13:23.202
-(chuckles)
Once or twice, I guess.
-Yeah?

13:23.302 --> 13:25.538
Have you ever been sketched?

13:25.638 --> 13:25.704
(snickers)

13:27.840 --> 13:29.341
So, there I was...

13:29.441 --> 13:31.777
living... as a, sort of, Godking

13:31.844 --> 13:33.979
among the cannibals of Nuperi.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.515
And they insisted I indulge,

13:36.615 --> 13:38.684
-if ya get my drift.
-(all gasp)

13:38.784 --> 13:44.456
Jeff, are you saying
you've tasted human flesh?

13:44.523 --> 13:47.326
-Not really, no.
-Antoinette: Oh.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.662
I did my best to get it
down without tasting it.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.164
(all laughing)

13:52.231 --> 13:53.532
-You're an incorrigible tease.
-What?

13:53.632 --> 13:56.202
I actually
did eat a man.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.537
Actually, I too,
have traveled.

13:58.637 --> 14:02.041
-In fact, I've got an amusing
anecdote about the time--
-Oh, Thornrose,

14:02.141 --> 14:04.977
will you never cease with
your incessant nattering?

14:05.044 --> 14:06.579
We are trying
to hear Jeff!

14:06.679 --> 14:08.647
Forgive him.
Forgive my friend here, okay?

14:08.714 --> 14:11.550
Once he's palmed
your cranium a few times,

14:11.650 --> 14:12.251
it's impossible
to shut him up.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.221
(all laughing)

14:15.321 --> 14:18.224
Seriously.
Half the time, I'm like,

14:18.324 --> 14:20.726
"Oh, Godfrey, will you
stop fingering my dents,

14:20.826 --> 14:22.261
and let's get back
to some accounting."

14:22.361 --> 14:24.530
(all laughing)

14:24.597 --> 14:26.398
If you ever want
to change careers,

14:26.498 --> 14:28.601
you can finger
my dents anytime.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.836
(all laughing)

14:30.903 --> 14:33.372
This is everything
I have on me.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.008
My people thank you
for your investment.

14:36.075 --> 14:36.775
With any luck
this little...

14:36.876 --> 14:38.744
pyramid scheme
of ours will make

14:38.844 --> 14:40.713
-us all very wealthy.
-(giggling)

14:40.779 --> 14:43.182
But remember,
you must be discreet.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.417
Okay?
Tell no one
of our pact.

14:45.517 --> 14:46.352
All right?

14:46.852 --> 14:48.454
Absolutely.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.559
-Mum's the word, Prince.
-(gives a blessing)

14:54.793 --> 14:59.131
-Go away. Keep your receipt.
-(giggling)

14:59.231 --> 15:00.099
(whispers):
How are you
so good at this?

15:00.199 --> 15:02.701
I know
a thing or two
about this lot.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.070
(Abshir clears throat)

15:07.206 --> 15:09.708
I can see what
you are doing.

15:09.775 --> 15:10.776
Honestly...
it was all his idea.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.145
We're not, we're not,
we're not even royalty,

15:13.245 --> 15:14.446
so we could just leave.
We can swim--

15:14.546 --> 15:15.648
Or...

15:16.949 --> 15:19.318
perhaps,
I can arrange
an office...

15:19.418 --> 15:22.721
so that Your Grace
can better...
conduct your affairs.

15:25.391 --> 15:26.959
Businessman.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.764
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
These people are great.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.933
They seem that way
at first, don't they?

15:33.999 --> 15:35.501
Aw, lighten up.
You're just sore 'cause
they like me more than you.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.804
It's a fickle crowd.
Trust me.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.006
Will you play us
something, Jeff?

15:41.106 --> 15:43.442
I'm not very musical, love.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.510
Plus, I only know shanties,
which are probably

15:44.610 --> 15:46.679
a little beneath the fancy
britches crowd like you.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.416
Oh, no!
We love a good shanty.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.451
Oh! I'll see what we
can come up with.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.153
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe, uh, this.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.487
-(runs down keys)
-Oh, come on.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.657
(cheery music playing)

15:58.757 --> 16:00.859
-Oh, I like to dance!
-(cheers and laughter)

16:05.264 --> 16:07.666
♪ ♪

16:08.701 --> 16:08.968
(gibberish)

16:12.771 --> 16:16.508
How's our barnacle
project comin'?

16:18.610 --> 16:22.348
I'm gonna kill that twat.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.951
Fang:
I've never had anyone take
interest in my form before.

16:26.018 --> 16:28.520
Well, you've never met
anyone worth a damn, then.

16:28.620 --> 16:32.658
Ahh, yer just bein' nice.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.526
Hey, guys.
Uh, the boss is
lookin' for you.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.695
What, Blackbeard's back?
Oh shit!

16:36.795 --> 16:40.399
Oh, no, no, no.
It's that little...
angry fecker, Izzy.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.835
Izzy the Spewer?
Let him look.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.737
Izzy the Spewer?
What's that about?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.572
Captain left him in charge once,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.374
and we were in choppy seas,

16:48.474 --> 16:50.542
and he spewed everywhere,

16:50.642 --> 16:52.311
and he shit himself, too.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.080
I mean, lots of shit.
(laughs)

16:55.180 --> 16:55.914
That's not
a bad likeness.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.584
You've really captured
somethin' there.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.352
I'm just recording
what's there.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.556
What the fuck?!

17:04.656 --> 17:06.892
(quiet chatter)

17:14.333 --> 17:16.101
Melon.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.203
Snail.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.606
Snail fork.

17:20.706 --> 17:21.740
Oh goodie.

17:21.840 --> 17:26.178
Jeff's seated
next to me.
(chuckles)

17:26.245 --> 17:27.679
-Yes, goodie.
-Oh.

17:27.746 --> 17:31.383
-(clinks)
-Ooh! (laughs)

17:31.450 --> 17:34.119
(all laughing)

17:39.758 --> 17:42.127
(cork pops, laughter continues)

17:46.532 --> 17:48.133
(quiet chatter)

17:52.971 --> 17:54.373
What's all this about?

17:55.541 --> 17:56.809
I'm really not
at liberty to say.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.912
Prince Azi
wouldn't like it.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.314
We appreciate your offer,
but, uh--

18:02.414 --> 18:04.283
Oh, please, I beg of you!
You must let me invest!

18:04.383 --> 18:07.653
I'm sorry the Prince
doesn't know what
you're talking about.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.956
Don't toy with this man.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.325
He's clearly
quite sophisticated.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.894
Please, I would love
to have you assist us.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.297
Oh, thank you,
Prince.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.965
Just, em...

18:20.065 --> 18:23.268
give us everything
valuable on you,
and, eh, you are in.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.603
Be quick, please.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.138
Business is, you know...

18:26.238 --> 18:27.439
-Your receipt, sir.
-Thank you.

18:27.506 --> 18:28.607
-(knocks on door)
-Thank you.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.276
There's a Steve
asking for you?

18:31.343 --> 18:34.513
-It's Stede, actually.
-Yeah, tell him we'll
meet him outside.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.815
-Hey, guys, what's
going on in here?
-Frenchie: Nothing.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.117
Take... okay.

18:38.183 --> 18:38.984
No, I know,
I know them.

18:39.084 --> 18:42.488
I know them.
I'm, I'm the Captain.

18:42.588 --> 18:43.689
Hi!

18:43.789 --> 18:45.624
...and I simply
wouldn't be caught

18:45.691 --> 18:47.159
dead in Paris
past Spring.

18:47.259 --> 18:50.329
-Would you, Jeff?
Would you summer in Paris?
-Hm?

18:50.429 --> 18:52.164
Uh...

18:52.698 --> 18:54.833
Sure, why not?

18:57.769 --> 19:02.107
Why, Jeff, you have
such an interesting
manner of eating.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.510
-(chuckles) Thank you, mate.
-Mm-hm.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.212
(all chuckling)

19:11.984 --> 19:13.852
Hang on.
That's, that's
passive aggression.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.688
Whatever do
you mean, Jeff?

19:16.788 --> 19:19.291
You're doing it again.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.192
Stop that.
I know what you're doing.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.861
-It's not clever!
-What's not clever?

19:22.961 --> 19:27.399
I don't know if you have
a problem with something
that we are doing.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.835
(all gasp)

19:30.903 --> 19:32.838
You have any idea who I am?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.543
I will kill every
last one of you.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.552
How will you do that,
Jeff the Accountant?

19:46.652 --> 19:49.555
-By boring us to death?
-(all laughing)

19:49.655 --> 19:52.090
Or maybe he'll
remove our heads

19:52.191 --> 19:55.561
with teaspoons, or--
Oh, escargot tongs!

19:55.661 --> 19:56.862
(all laughing)

20:02.000 --> 20:05.871
Stede was right!
You're all fuckin' fickle!
All of you!

20:05.938 --> 20:07.239
(all laughing)

20:10.509 --> 20:12.177
Captain Stede:
I was never very
good at these things.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.580
Yeah,
from my experience...

20:14.680 --> 20:17.282
these things are meant
to make you feel like
a bit of a jackass.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.452
I was in service for a minute
so I know the lay of the land,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.888
and trust me, servants,
they see everything.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.690
This lot?

20:25.524 --> 20:26.725
They're not so fancy.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.393
Get the fuck outta my way.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.232
-You all right, mate?
-I think I wanna go now.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.200
-Captain Stede: What?
-What'd they do to you, man?

20:35.267 --> 20:36.435
Did something
happen over dinner?

20:36.535 --> 20:37.736
Uh, yeah, well,
uh, I don't know.

20:37.803 --> 20:39.538
Um, I used escargot tongs

20:39.605 --> 20:40.706
and a melon spoon
to eat a fucking prawn!

20:40.772 --> 20:43.775
-Oh god. No!
-Oh, they are such
dicks about spoons.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.278
-Why would you?
-I don't know, I panicked.

20:46.378 --> 20:47.746
And then, they laughed at me.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.884
-Nobody laughs at me.
-Captain Stede:
Edward, put that away!

20:52.951 --> 20:56.822
I'm serious!
Stand down now!

20:58.557 --> 20:59.791
You're in over your head.

21:01.293 --> 21:05.230
These are my people.
I'll deal with it.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.766
You're gonna swab
the deck... twice.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.769
Then patch the mainsail,
oil and rewick the cannons,

21:10.836 --> 21:11.603
then stack the munitions,

21:11.670 --> 21:13.005
and by the time
you've done all that,

21:13.105 --> 21:16.675
I'll have several
more chores for you.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.078
And what if I don't?
You're not my captain.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.316
I could spill all your beans.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.953
You've been a proper little
seductress, haven't you?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.989
Black Pete, Fang.
Who else is there?

21:31.089 --> 21:34.126
-Hey, Pete?
-Yeah, love?

21:34.192 --> 21:37.929
-I drew Fang naked.
-(laughs) Nice.

21:37.996 --> 21:41.300
He's drawn most of us.

21:41.366 --> 21:44.269
See?
We don't own each other.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.673
Dizzy Izzy.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.374
Or is it...
Izzy the Spewer?

21:49.474 --> 21:52.277
It'd be a shame
if the entire crew
learned about

21:52.344 --> 21:53.211
that nickname,
wouldn't it?

21:56.014 --> 21:58.116
Go now.

21:58.183 --> 21:59.685
Have you ever
been sketched?

22:01.153 --> 22:01.386
Fuck off.

22:04.623 --> 22:08.460
(laughs)
Oh! Yes.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.731
That was hot.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.967
(indistinct chatter)

22:16.034 --> 22:19.471
Ah, look, it's
the Head Toucher.

22:19.538 --> 22:24.042
And where is your friend,
Monsieur Prawn?

22:24.142 --> 22:25.510
-(all laughing)
-Clever.

22:25.577 --> 22:30.182
Hey, I've noticed that we
have yet to play a game.

22:30.248 --> 22:34.319
So I'd like to propose one
called "Stark Revelations."

22:34.386 --> 22:37.889
Pff, it sounds
absolutely pedestrian.

22:37.989 --> 22:41.026
I'm already so bored
I could die.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.761
Well, I thought
you might say that.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.896
It might be a little
over this room's head.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.566
It is more
of a Parisian game,
after all.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.067
I'll have you know that
we are as sophisticated

22:49.167 --> 22:51.069
as any Parisian
you would ever know.

22:51.169 --> 22:54.706
We will play your
dreadful little thingy.

22:54.773 --> 22:55.574
-What are the rules?
-Mm.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.343
Well, it's quite simple.
I ask a question,

22:58.410 --> 23:00.912
and if you can't answer,
I get a point.

23:01.012 --> 23:03.615
If you can answer,
all of you get a point.

23:03.715 --> 23:08.787
So, let me understand.
It is you versus all of us?

23:08.887 --> 23:11.089
(all laughing)

23:11.189 --> 23:14.893
Exactly...
Let us begin.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.264
-Now, ah, Sebastian--
-Ohh.

23:19.364 --> 23:22.734
have you ever had
a child out of wedlock?

23:22.801 --> 23:25.971
Named, say... Daphne?

23:26.071 --> 23:31.243
-(all gasp)
-Eugenia, isn't that
the name of your child?

23:31.309 --> 23:32.944
(all laughing)

23:33.044 --> 23:36.114
Score one for me!

23:36.214 --> 23:38.650
Now, ah yes, Siegfried.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.919
I hear you're
struggling financially?

23:40.986 --> 23:43.755
Piffle! Patently false.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.557
Maybe because you've
been embezzling from

23:45.624 --> 23:48.293
your business partner
for the past...

23:48.393 --> 23:50.295
-eight months?
-(all gasp)

23:50.395 --> 23:52.998
Gabriel:
I didn't know people
still embezzled.

23:53.098 --> 23:57.302
-How grubby.
-I know, just inherit it
like a normal person.

23:57.402 --> 23:59.738
-Gabriel? Antoinette?
-Both: Mmm.

23:59.805 --> 24:02.741
You've both been married
for some time, haven't you?

24:02.808 --> 24:06.111
-Yes, for many years.
-We're deliriously happy.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.313
Tell me, how did you two meet?

24:08.413 --> 24:11.650
-We met at a, a ball.
-A picnic.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.519
You see, I think you
might have met at birth.

24:16.655 --> 24:19.858
Seeing as how you're
actually siblings!

24:19.958 --> 24:22.828
-(all gasp)
-That is inane!

24:22.928 --> 24:25.163
Go fuck yourself,
Thornrose.

24:25.263 --> 24:28.166
Oh, please, we've all
suspected for years.

24:28.266 --> 24:32.671
-And I told you he was a crook!
-So what if I am?

24:32.771 --> 24:34.172
I don't need
your money anymore.

24:34.272 --> 24:38.844
I'm going to be richer
than all of you!

24:38.944 --> 24:43.515
-I own half a pyramid.
-I own half a pyramid.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.650
I own half a pyramid, too!

24:45.717 --> 24:46.685
Give me those!

24:46.785 --> 24:50.188
-(grunts)
-That is for shagging
my Eugenia!

24:50.288 --> 24:53.124
Told you.
We see everything.

24:53.191 --> 24:56.561
You weren't wrong,
Frenchie, Olu.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.064
-Thanks for the info, Abshir.
-It was my pleasure.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.367
-(glass shatters)
-(retching)

25:04.503 --> 25:06.972
Why should our love
be forbidden?

25:07.038 --> 25:11.309
Because you're
my fucking brother, Gabriel!
It's disgusting!

25:11.376 --> 25:15.380
-Fuck is goin' on in here?
-Now they are truly worthless!

25:17.315 --> 25:19.551
What the hell did
you do to 'em?

25:19.651 --> 25:21.920
(all shouting)

25:22.020 --> 25:24.089
Passive aggression.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.426
(distant shouting)

25:31.496 --> 25:34.399
When you cut loose,
you really cut loose.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.568
Thanks.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.570
Hey, what'd you do
with our earnings?

25:39.938 --> 25:42.407
I reinvested them...
wisely.

25:42.507 --> 25:45.777
So, what are we going
to do with all this money?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.279
I don't know.
Sharpen the con a bit.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.082
We'll say,
"I'm a Nigerian Prince

25:51.182 --> 25:53.919
in terrible need
of assistance." Ha!

25:59.791 --> 26:02.694

26:11.770 --> 26:13.438
I'm sorry tonight
was a bit of a bust.

26:13.538 --> 26:16.241
No, no, mate,
you were right.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.375
-Wasn't ready.
-I don't know.

26:17.442 --> 26:21.379
I think you're
very sophisticated.

26:21.446 --> 26:24.115
-Thank you.
-Well, that's a lovely piece
of silk you have there.

26:24.215 --> 26:26.451
Oh, this tatty old thing?

26:26.551 --> 26:28.820
