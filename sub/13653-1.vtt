WEBVTT

02:49.501 --> 02:50.626
Stop!

04:27.959 --> 04:30.667
There you are.

04:31.542 --> 04:35.126
Jen, hold on one second.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.834
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

04:39.126 --> 04:41.292
- Really?
- I missed you.

04:41.584 --> 04:43.501
We're so remote. But you made it.

04:43.792 --> 04:47.251
Welcome to my new hospital.

04:47.709 --> 04:48.917
Yeah, it's very new.

04:49.209 --> 04:51.459
We're still settling in.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.667
They haven't woken up yet?

04:56.167 --> 04:58.084
Not a single one.

04:58.376 --> 05:00.876
They don't even move in their sleep.

05:01.251 --> 05:04.792
How is your leg?
Didn't you use my herbal cream?

05:05.084 --> 05:08.001
I did.
But it wasn't absorbed into my bones.

05:08.292 --> 05:11.501
Really? Show me what you use.

05:11.792 --> 05:14.042
The cream I gave you is a good one.

05:14.334 --> 05:16.001
What did you use?

05:16.292 --> 05:18.042
- Here.
- What is it?

05:18.334 --> 05:20.126
This is my new collection.

05:20.417 --> 05:21.876
Aren't they pretty?

05:23.042 --> 05:25.459
So diligent.
You haven't stopped knitting?

05:25.751 --> 05:28.501
I always see you knitting.

05:28.792 --> 05:33.084
The patterns are very Japanese.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.917
Take a look.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.834
Colourful Japanese baby socks.

05:39.126 --> 05:43.001
But we have only
sleeping soldiers here.

05:43.751 --> 05:46.084
Who will be our customers?

05:47.709 --> 05:51.042
We can try with the female relatives.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.126
They might buy them for their kids.

05:54.417 --> 05:57.876
They are only villagers.

05:59.334 --> 06:00.792
It's not the same as before.

06:01.084 --> 06:04.334
Maybe I can make socks
for these guys.

06:05.334 --> 06:06.876
You can try that.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.542
I miss this school a lot.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.959
Back then...

06:16.542 --> 06:20.876
I sat there...
Where that guy is sleeping.

06:21.751 --> 06:26.792
The blackboard was too far
for me to read properly...

06:29.167 --> 06:31.792
Keng, how are you?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.876
- Need any help?
- I'm OK.

06:35.876 --> 06:38.626
I often looked out of the window.

06:39.709 --> 06:44.001
At the jackfruit tree.
The mango tree...

06:45.417 --> 06:49.792
My English teacher liked to sit
under that jackfruit tree.

06:50.084 --> 06:55.251
He wore dark-rimmed glasses...
Handsome as Clark Kent in Superman.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.084
- That handsome?
- Yes.

06:59.292 --> 07:02.542
The soldiers just sleep...

07:03.626 --> 07:05.959
The army doesn't know
what to do with them.

07:06.251 --> 07:09.001
They took up too much space
at the hospital.

07:09.292 --> 07:11.251
Will he wake up?

07:11.626 --> 07:13.251
Not easily.

07:17.251 --> 07:20.209
Jen, see that young woman?

07:20.501 --> 07:22.501
- Which one?
- By that bed.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.334
She's very talented for her age.

07:26.042 --> 07:28.209
She normally works for the police.

07:28.501 --> 07:32.251
She helps contact the spirits
of murder victims.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.334
Or missing-persons.

07:35.042 --> 07:37.126
She was approached by the FBI.

07:37.417 --> 07:38.417
- Really?
- Yes.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.376
They offered her a house, a car,
and a big salary.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.417
- But she declined.
- Why?

07:43.709 --> 07:46.459
She told them,
"I only serve my country."

07:46.751 --> 07:49.167
That's so admirable.

07:49.751 --> 07:52.126
Excuse me... Don't go anywhere.

07:52.417 --> 07:55.876
Dr. Prasan! Excuse me, doctor!

07:57.876 --> 07:59.876
Dr. Prasan!

08:00.876 --> 08:06.209
You forgot to sign the prescription.

08:06.876 --> 08:09.542
- From this morning?
- Yes.

08:13.334 --> 08:16.209
He is walking about somewhere.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.251
He's confused.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.459
It's a dark night.

08:27.167 --> 08:30.084
But he can still see.

08:34.083 --> 08:36.083
There's a mound of dirt.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.542
Concrete pillars.

08:42.626 --> 08:45.792
He has a pen
and is writing something down.

08:49.709 --> 08:52.209
His friends are watching him.

08:52.626 --> 08:54.959
Male or female friends?

08:56.626 --> 08:58.542
Both.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.792
Is he happy?

09:07.417 --> 09:09.334
What would he like to eat?

09:11.876 --> 09:14.251
Minced meat and a bamboo shoot soup.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.667
Minced meat and a bamboo shoot soup?

09:20.292 --> 09:22.251
How spicy?

09:25.334 --> 09:28.209
Three chillies is enough.

09:32.334 --> 09:33.792
And a coke, too.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.084
With ice?

10:46.501 --> 10:49.334
You make me miss the old hospital.

10:50.042 --> 10:52.792
This place is just as nice.

10:53.084 --> 10:55.667
- You'll soon forget the old one.
- Yes.

10:58.167 --> 11:00.459
Keep an eye on him for me.

11:04.709 --> 11:08.251
How are you, Auntie?

11:09.626 --> 11:11.792
- It's hot today, right?
- Yes.

11:12.084 --> 11:14.459
The day will pass quickly.

11:14.751 --> 11:17.417
Did you go to the concert last night?

11:18.751 --> 11:21.459
I went. But I didn't stay long.

11:22.709 --> 11:25.251
Let me check on the other soldiers.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.667
OK, let his head down.

13:08.542 --> 13:11.876
Attach this tube to his nose.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.001
- Like this?
- Yes, and press this button.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.251
This machine works very well.

13:21.542 --> 13:24.834
They used it with American soldiers
in Afghanistan.

13:25.126 --> 13:28.501
- They also have nightmares?
- Yes.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.042
- I'd like to try one at home.
- Good.

13:31.334 --> 13:32.834
Will it stop the snoring?

13:33.126 --> 13:36.167
Yes, it will help them sleep
with good dreams.

13:36.459 --> 13:40.084
- Should I turn it on?
- Yes.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.459
Should we close the windows?

13:45.751 --> 13:48.167
Let's close them.

13:48.709 --> 13:51.417
Doctor, please give me a hand.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.667
Close them please.

14:09.417 --> 14:11.209
Looks like funeral lights.

14:11.501 --> 14:13.792
Yes, I felt so too.

14:23.876 --> 14:24.959
Hi.

14:29.292 --> 14:30.376
Need a hand?

14:30.667 --> 14:32.209
I can manage.

14:38.959 --> 14:40.626
Are your noodles tasty?

14:40.917 --> 14:42.792
Yes. Want to try some?

14:43.292 --> 14:45.542
No, thank you.

14:46.334 --> 14:48.001
I'm on a diet.

14:52.084 --> 14:54.959
But those fried bananas
are loaded with calories.

14:55.251 --> 14:59.209
They reuse the oil,
maybe thousands of times.

14:59.709 --> 15:01.876
It's just a snack.

15:02.959 --> 15:06.251
At home, I eat very healthily.

15:10.959 --> 15:15.334
Normally, I don't sleep very well.

15:16.876 --> 15:22.001
I get three or four hours sleep
at best.

15:23.751 --> 15:26.626
Since coming here,
I'm sleeping much better.

15:26.917 --> 15:30.251
It's as if I'm synchronising
with that soldier.

15:30.751 --> 15:32.792
Or maybe he's sleeping for me.

15:33.876 --> 15:36.167
Do you know a drug called Melatonin?

15:36.459 --> 15:38.626
It's good for older women.

15:39.251 --> 15:42.417
Yeah?
Then it's definitely not for me.

15:43.501 --> 15:45.334
I'm kidding.

15:48.417 --> 15:51.084
This small town
can bore you to death.

15:52.292 --> 15:55.667
At least,
there are the sleeping soldiers

15:56.084 --> 15:58.917
to make things more exciting.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.959
You're lucky, then.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.459
I'm quite tired of talking to them.

16:04.751 --> 16:07.376
Their relatives always ask me
for lottery numbers.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.542
As if I can see the future.

16:11.334 --> 16:13.167
You can't?

16:15.709 --> 16:18.001
Can you teach me your trick?

16:18.626 --> 16:22.167
I don't know how.
I've had this gift since I was young.

16:22.459 --> 16:26.209
Out of the blue,
I could recall my past life as a boy.

16:26.501 --> 16:28.292
I fell from a tree and died.

16:28.584 --> 16:29.834
Wow!

16:30.126 --> 16:32.251
- You saw it that clearly?
- Yes.

16:36.084 --> 16:40.792
The good thing for me here is that
I get free medicines to take home.

16:44.626 --> 16:48.251
Sister, can I borrow some money?

16:48.542 --> 16:50.417
I have to pay for my mortgage.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.126
- Are you serious?
- If you don't mind.

16:53.417 --> 16:56.667
Sure. If you can cure my lame leg.

16:57.292 --> 17:00.417
Make my right leg
as long as the left.

17:00.709 --> 17:01.917
Can you?

17:02.209 --> 17:05.666
I'm a psychic. I can only read minds.

17:06.709 --> 17:08.541
Help me finish the bananas.

17:11.541 --> 17:16.666
But you are an FBI agent, aren't you?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.416
- Is it moving?
- Yes.

17:31.084 --> 17:36.292
Have you been eating
raw or pickled fish or meat?

17:36.584 --> 17:40.167
- Yes, they are my favourite dishes.
- I thought so.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.876
With the village headman?

17:43.167 --> 17:45.459
Yesterday, we had a celebration.

17:46.626 --> 17:50.167
- Do I have a parasite?
- Yes, you have worms.

17:50.459 --> 17:52.792
Let me take another look.

18:01.042 --> 18:03.084
There. Can you feel it?

18:06.959 --> 18:08.667
Can you remove it?

18:12.292 --> 18:16.667
I only have kids' stuff here.

18:17.167 --> 18:20.459
I'll transfer you to a real hospital.

18:21.876 --> 18:24.084
Isn't this a real hospital?

18:27.626 --> 18:30.334
Yes, but it's a small one.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.542
We don't have much equipment.

18:34.084 --> 18:37.334
Give this to the nurse.

18:37.751 --> 18:41.459
And take more vitamins.
You're too thin.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.167
Thank you, Doctor.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.459
Uncle, it's your turn.

18:49.876 --> 18:51.626
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.667
How are you feeling?

18:54.042 --> 18:57.334
I lost my appetite and I can't sleep.

18:57.709 --> 19:01.542
- Are you stressed out?
- Not really.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.376
Worried about
the Agricultural Bank loan?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.792
Maybe that's part of it.

19:07.084 --> 19:10.792
But my body just won't sleep.

19:11.626 --> 19:15.792
- How so?
- I feel tired but I can't sleep.

21:50.501 --> 21:54.626
We're expanding the kitchen.
What colour do you want?

21:56.292 --> 21:57.501
Brown.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.376
Brown?

21:59.667 --> 22:01.542
Would you like floor tiles?

22:03.709 --> 22:05.876
He doesn't know what they are.

22:06.542 --> 22:09.167
How can he not?

22:11.417 --> 22:14.959
In the olden days,
the kitchen was outside.

22:17.501 --> 22:19.751
I heard he has a mistress.

22:20.042 --> 22:23.251
Tell me where he's hiding her.

22:25.876 --> 22:28.542
I'm seeing his past life now.

22:30.084 --> 22:34.542
Why? Please focus on the present.

22:37.626 --> 22:40.209
He's sitting somewhere.

22:40.751 --> 22:42.876
There is someone with him.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.542
Who is it?

22:47.626 --> 22:49.542
I can't see clearly.

22:50.626 --> 22:52.501
I want to know.

22:52.792 --> 22:54.792
Try to focus, please.

23:16.959 --> 23:21.209
Our problem
is that we think too much.

23:21.709 --> 23:23.834
All day, and all night...

23:24.126 --> 23:26.626
At night, we call it dreaming...

23:26.917 --> 23:28.876
We all dream.

23:29.251 --> 23:30.751
We can't stop them.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.876
Thoughts are the same.

23:33.167 --> 23:38.001
Since we can't stop them,
we must become more aware.

23:38.292 --> 23:42.001
Aware of our thoughts,
and of our dreams.

23:43.334 --> 23:49.042
[The sea can be violent
or still with no pattern...]

23:49.334 --> 23:53.667
[My family is very ordinary...]

23:58.167 --> 24:03.667
Heaven and hell, merit and sin
are all suppositions.

24:04.167 --> 24:06.292
Don't put too much faith in them.

24:06.584 --> 24:11.959
Meditation trains your mind.

24:12.334 --> 24:18.417
The visions we see are caused
by chemical reactions in our brain.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.792
[Everyone has his own karma.]

24:22.084 --> 24:27.001
[I pleaded to the gods
for my next life.]

24:27.292 --> 24:30.542
[Life is like candlelight.]

24:33.542 --> 24:36.792
When you sleep,
your mind is still active.

24:38.334 --> 24:42.376
[When he sees his nephew,
he always asks why he's so thin.]

24:42.667 --> 24:44.459
["Don't you buy him milk?"]

24:44.751 --> 24:46.501
[They held hands...]

24:46.792 --> 24:49.084
[He was the youngest one...]

24:50.334 --> 24:55.084
Anyone can achieve awareness
if they train their mind.

24:56.167 --> 24:58.792
[HELLO]

25:02.542 --> 25:05.001
Let's do a simple exercise.

25:05.334 --> 25:08.459
Don't think too much about it.

25:08.751 --> 25:10.459
Sit up straight.

25:10.959 --> 25:13.667
And slowly close your eyes.

25:13.959 --> 25:18.959
Focus on your upper body
and your brain.

25:19.417 --> 25:23.542
Pull your thoughts down
into your body.

25:25.084 --> 25:27.334
All the way down to your feet.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.292
Focus on your face now.

25:30.584 --> 25:33.084
What does it look like?

25:33.376 --> 25:34.792
Look at yourself.

25:35.084 --> 25:37.001
Your eyebrows.

25:37.334 --> 25:39.001
Your eyes.

25:39.292 --> 25:41.542
Try to imagine them.

25:41.876 --> 25:44.626
What are your ears like?

25:46.084 --> 25:48.084
Focus on your mouth.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.084
And now your chin.

25:51.417 --> 25:55.084
Slowly move your focus up.

25:55.626 --> 25:58.209
To the tip of your nose.

25:58.626 --> 26:02.792
Let it spread out.

26:03.084 --> 26:05.459
Away from your body.

26:06.084 --> 26:08.334
Until it fills the entire room.

26:08.751 --> 26:13.334
Move this ball of energy
to the field outside.

26:14.334 --> 26:18.667
Once it's outside, let it expand.

26:19.084 --> 26:23.001
Let it float into the sky.

26:23.876 --> 26:26.667
Until it reaches the moon.

26:27.876 --> 26:33.001
From the moon,
let it spread to the stars.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.626
It's spread to all the stars now.

26:36.917 --> 26:39.667
Now pull that energy back.

26:39.959 --> 26:44.667
Slowly pull it back into yourself.

26:45.042 --> 26:48.626
If your stomach hurts,
let the energy flow to your stomach.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.042
Let it heal you.

26:50.334 --> 26:55.334
If you have cancer,
hypertension, diabetes or AIDS,

26:55.626 --> 27:00.459
let this energy come in and heal you.

27:00.751 --> 27:04.084
Until you feel better.

27:04.709 --> 27:07.626
Once you feel better,

27:07.917 --> 27:11.542
gather the energy
to the back of your neck.

27:12.084 --> 27:14.334
Let it collect there.

27:15.959 --> 27:19.334
Once it's gathered then...

31:45.292 --> 31:46.834
I'm a volunteer...

31:47.126 --> 31:49.542
I heard that you had no relatives.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.084
I know...

31:53.084 --> 31:55.417
I could hear you in my sleep.

31:57.542 --> 32:00.001
So you already know me, then.

32:03.084 --> 32:04.542
Sorry.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.251
I'm sorry... I... a lot.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.001
What?

32:15.542 --> 32:17.459
I'm sorry that I peed a lot.

32:25.167 --> 32:26.876
I can't move.

32:27.167 --> 32:28.626
Move what?

32:29.751 --> 32:30.959
My arm.

32:35.751 --> 32:37.167
I'm going to let go.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.334
Try it again.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.209
Higher.

33:06.626 --> 33:08.792
You should get up

33:09.084 --> 33:10.667
before you fall asleep again.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.459
Let me help you.

33:14.751 --> 33:15.876
OK?

33:21.959 --> 33:23.084
What is it?

33:44.876 --> 33:47.209
Slowly, or your head will spin.

35:08.876 --> 35:10.667
Let's sit here.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.542
Have you seen my phone charger?

35:39.084 --> 35:40.542
I don't know.

35:41.751 --> 35:43.959
I want to contact my family.

35:44.251 --> 35:46.251
I saved the number in my phone.

35:46.751 --> 35:49.209
But I can't find the charger.

35:54.751 --> 35:56.667
Are you from the south?

35:57.417 --> 35:59.334
Does my accent give me away?

35:59.959 --> 36:02.292
You have darker skin.

36:02.584 --> 36:04.126
But with a strange accent.

36:04.417 --> 36:06.084
My mom is from the west.

36:07.292 --> 36:09.251
Can you speak Southern Thai?

36:10.876 --> 36:12.667
How can you speak it?

36:13.167 --> 36:15.459
It's a talent I have.

36:16.959 --> 36:18.792
How's my Isan dialect?

36:20.959 --> 36:23.459
How's my Isan dialect?

36:25.751 --> 36:27.959
How's my Isan dialect?

36:28.334 --> 36:32.084
Keep eating the local chilli paste
and your accent will improve.

36:38.626 --> 36:40.001
Tasty food, right?

36:40.542 --> 36:41.876
Yes it is.

36:44.959 --> 36:47.001
Honey!

36:47.501 --> 36:49.626
It's not your bedtime yet.

38:02.709 --> 38:05.917
Today, I present you
with my best offerings.

38:06.209 --> 38:08.042
You'll like them.

38:08.334 --> 38:13.459
May my family possess good health
and happiness.

38:13.751 --> 38:19.167
May I retain my beauty
with no wrinkles.

38:19.542 --> 38:26.792
May Itt, my new son, wake up again.

38:27.709 --> 38:28.876
Honey,

38:31.167 --> 38:32.959
help me please.

38:36.709 --> 38:41.084
This is the cheetah,
to help strengthen my leg.

38:41.501 --> 38:43.334
And this...

38:44.334 --> 38:45.667
It's a gibbon.

38:46.334 --> 38:48.417
I don't know the English name.

38:48.709 --> 38:51.001
It's to make your hand strong.

38:51.292 --> 38:52.292
Oh, good! Thank you.

38:52.584 --> 38:54.792
And this tiger.

38:56.709 --> 39:00.084
It's for our new son to be stronger.

39:00.501 --> 39:01.792
We have a new son?

39:02.084 --> 39:05.501
Yes, his name Itt. I told you.

39:05.792 --> 39:07.001
I see.

39:07.292 --> 39:09.376
Yeah, he's a good man.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.126
He serve the nation.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.751
You are foreigner.
You won't get it, honey.

39:14.042 --> 39:15.459
No, no, I do understand.

39:15.751 --> 39:17.667
I know you're very patriotic.

39:18.334 --> 39:19.459
- Please.
- OK.

39:19.751 --> 39:21.251
Be careful, huh.

41:05.084 --> 41:07.626
Your sense of colour is really nice.

41:07.917 --> 41:12.292
The housewives will love
the pink and fluorescent green.

41:12.584 --> 41:15.667
They have good taste around here.

41:16.751 --> 41:20.501
Why don't you do
the car-boot sale everyday?

41:20.792 --> 41:24.459
Just weekends is enough for me.

41:25.292 --> 41:29.042
The library doesn't look busy,
but there's a lot to do.

41:29.334 --> 41:33.542
It's also hard to compete for a space
at the market.

41:33.959 --> 41:36.084
- Have a seat.
- OK.

41:36.751 --> 41:39.251
Thanks so much for these longkongs.

41:39.542 --> 41:41.834
You're welcome.
They're from my orchard.

41:42.126 --> 41:45.917
I have a lot of longkong trees.
And I don't use pesticides.

41:46.209 --> 41:49.792
Your house must be very big
to have an orchard.

41:50.084 --> 41:51.626
Do you want to visit?

41:52.167 --> 41:53.959
You don't mind?

41:54.417 --> 41:56.001
How about today?

41:56.709 --> 42:00.626
Maybe some other time.
So that I can bring my camera, too.

42:01.042 --> 42:02.417
Up to you.

42:03.334 --> 42:07.209
Did you read
the latest volume of "Satan's Love"?

42:07.501 --> 42:11.084
- It just arrived.
- Really? Which shelf is it on?

42:12.167 --> 42:13.792
Wait here.

42:56.501 --> 42:59.209
I've been away from home
for a long time.

42:59.501 --> 43:01.167
Where's your home?

43:02.084 --> 43:04.834
Very far away. I really miss it.

43:05.126 --> 43:07.667
- Care to join me?
- OK.

43:09.417 --> 43:10.876
Do you want some?

43:12.417 --> 43:15.084
They look good.
Where did you get them?

43:15.417 --> 43:17.167
A man gave them to me.

43:17.459 --> 43:19.251
They're called longkongs.

43:19.542 --> 43:21.001
Mind if I taste?

43:25.334 --> 43:28.459
It's so sweet, sister.
The very nectar of temptation.

43:28.751 --> 43:30.876
Please have some more.

43:32.959 --> 43:34.667
May I join you?

43:36.626 --> 43:38.459
Who is this, I wonder?

43:39.417 --> 43:40.876
Look at these.

43:42.542 --> 43:45.251
- What do you think?
- They're beautiful.

43:45.626 --> 43:48.001
So many beautiful clothes.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.667
Pretty and colourful.

43:51.042 --> 43:53.459
Don't you think? Feel the cloth.

43:55.876 --> 43:57.667
They're nice.

43:58.334 --> 44:00.167
But they're not my style.

44:00.459 --> 44:02.251
I think I'll pass.

44:02.542 --> 44:04.626
Besides I have to save money.

44:05.042 --> 44:09.292
Sister, these are for us...

44:09.584 --> 44:12.251
My sister got them from the market.

44:12.751 --> 44:15.084
You two know each other?

44:16.292 --> 44:18.376
Help yourself to some fruit.

44:18.667 --> 44:19.959
Thank you.

44:20.876 --> 44:25.542
We'd like to thank you
for the miniature animal offerings.

44:27.084 --> 44:28.542
Pardon?

44:29.167 --> 44:32.167
They are really lovely,
especially the gibbon.

44:32.459 --> 44:34.251
What do you mean?

44:34.626 --> 44:37.751
The mini animals that you gave us
the other day.

44:38.042 --> 44:39.292
Weren't they from you?

44:39.584 --> 44:41.542
- From me?
- Yes.

44:42.167 --> 44:46.667
You offered them at our shrine...
by the lake.

44:47.417 --> 44:49.667
You're crazy.

44:50.751 --> 44:54.251
We're the princesses from the shrine.

44:56.626 --> 45:01.292
We don't usually appear
in normal street wear like today...

45:01.584 --> 45:05.501
If you see us with make-up,
in our traditional clothes,

45:05.792 --> 45:08.959
we are identical to the statues
at the shrine.

45:12.417 --> 45:14.792
I beg your mercy,
your Royal Highnesses.

45:15.167 --> 45:19.334
Stop it.
Those royal words make us itchy.

45:19.626 --> 45:24.084
Thank you for bringing me happiness.

45:24.751 --> 45:29.667
Thank you for bringing Richard Widner
from America.

45:31.251 --> 45:32.751
Where is he today?

45:33.042 --> 45:35.417
He's in town extending his visa...

45:35.959 --> 45:40.542
Want to visit my house
and try my herbal tea?

45:41.334 --> 45:42.792
Maybe another day.

45:43.084 --> 45:46.126
Today, we came to tell you

45:46.417 --> 45:50.667
that those soldiers will never recover.

45:51.042 --> 45:52.459
At the old school?

45:52.751 --> 45:56.751
Yes, there used to be a palace there.

45:57.042 --> 45:59.792
A war broke out between the kingdoms

46:00.292 --> 46:03.001
thousands of years ago.

46:03.292 --> 46:07.501
Bodies of dead villagers and soldiers
laid everywhere.

46:07.792 --> 46:11.834
But most importantly,
the cemetery of the kings

46:12.126 --> 46:15.251
was located beneath
your elementary school.

46:15.751 --> 46:17.334
Let me explain.

46:17.876 --> 46:19.834
The spirits of the dead kings

46:20.126 --> 46:24.251
are drawing on the soldiers' energy
to fight their battles.

46:24.542 --> 46:28.667
They are still fighting as we speak.

46:29.334 --> 46:30.751
How can that be?

46:31.042 --> 46:35.959
I thought their spirits
had already passed away.

46:38.292 --> 46:41.667
Both of us are dead as well.

47:51.084 --> 47:55.001
You can apply the medicinal balm now.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.876
The soldiers are sleeping better.

48:01.417 --> 48:03.292
And having fewer nightmares.

48:03.584 --> 48:07.876
It must be these machines,
or the coloured lights.

48:08.167 --> 48:11.459
Or maybe the meditation is working.

48:12.709 --> 48:15.417
Keng, are you done?

48:18.959 --> 48:22.626
Yesterday, something happened.

48:22.959 --> 48:26.376
The goddesses from Laos
appeared before me.

48:26.667 --> 48:31.959
They said we are standing
on top of the cemetery of the kings.

48:32.251 --> 48:33.667
What?

48:34.417 --> 48:36.792
This school was a cemetery?

48:37.334 --> 48:40.251
- The goddesses from the lake shrine?
- Yes.

48:40.542 --> 48:44.334
They also said that the spirits
of the dead kings

48:44.751 --> 48:49.292
are using these men's spirits
for their battles.

48:49.584 --> 48:51.251
Is that so?

48:52.167 --> 48:56.792
Perhaps the soldiers
were their troops in the past.

48:57.959 --> 49:03.792
So the kings have put
the sleeping soldiers to good use?

49:04.751 --> 49:07.042
Were the goddesses beautiful, sister?

49:07.334 --> 49:11.084
Yes, even without make-up

49:11.376 --> 49:14.459
their skin is flawless.

49:15.251 --> 49:19.751
It must be their magic power,
since they are hundreds of years old.

49:20.042 --> 49:22.667
They looked younger than me.

49:23.626 --> 49:28.667
You have to be dead.
That's their secret.

49:28.959 --> 49:32.251
So that's why,
when I was a student here...

49:32.542 --> 49:34.876
I always felt sleepy.

49:35.542 --> 49:38.459
So we will be here
for a long time, then.

49:39.292 --> 49:44.001
Until the fibre optic cable company
kicks everyone out.

49:44.959 --> 49:48.626
I'm happy to know that at least

49:48.917 --> 49:51.209
he's doing some good in his sleep.

49:52.167 --> 49:55.001
Are you serious?

49:58.334 --> 50:00.542
Look...

50:01.334 --> 50:03.542
He's waking up.

50:04.167 --> 50:05.459
See?

50:06.751 --> 50:09.834
Do you want to try to touch it, Jen?

50:10.126 --> 50:12.084
It's OK.

50:12.376 --> 50:15.542
I've touched way too many penises
in my life.

50:16.626 --> 50:18.334
May I?

50:29.501 --> 50:32.209
How amazing.

51:05.751 --> 51:07.792
HELLO

52:52.626 --> 52:54.001
Hello.

52:54.542 --> 52:56.001
Hello.

53:10.876 --> 53:12.334
I'm with Poy.

53:14.042 --> 53:16.084
Why? He's just a friend.

53:17.501 --> 53:19.084
Can we go and see you?

53:20.751 --> 53:23.001
He asked if we can go and see you.

53:25.084 --> 53:27.667
Does he have cute friends?

53:28.084 --> 53:30.001
Do you have cute friends?

53:31.542 --> 53:32.792
He says he has lots.

53:33.084 --> 53:35.334
We'll go and see you, OK?

53:40.334 --> 53:42.251
Do you want fried mussel pancake?

53:43.167 --> 53:45.334
No, I haven't finished this dish yet.

53:46.542 --> 53:49.167
Can you smell the dipping sauce?

53:49.751 --> 53:52.334
The smell is very sharp to me.

53:53.251 --> 53:55.667
Soy sauce and sugar.

53:56.084 --> 53:58.001
What does sugar smell like?

53:58.417 --> 54:01.126
I can separate all the smells
in this market...

54:01.417 --> 54:02.417
Really?

54:05.334 --> 54:08.959
I can feel the temperatures
of the lights.

54:10.751 --> 54:12.959
You're like Superman.

54:13.626 --> 54:15.251
It's true.

54:15.751 --> 54:18.792
I can smell the flowers
in my dreams, too.

54:19.084 --> 54:20.459
Yeah?

54:21.042 --> 54:24.251
That's an important quality
for a good soldier.

54:26.959 --> 54:29.167
How about your husband?

54:30.542 --> 54:32.667
He's a soldier, like you...

54:34.042 --> 54:35.876
But not from your unit.

54:37.042 --> 54:39.001
He's from America.

54:39.542 --> 54:41.001
Congratulations!

54:41.626 --> 54:45.334
Well, I don't know.
My English is not good...

54:45.959 --> 54:47.876
We met online.

54:48.876 --> 54:51.459
I could type
and look at the dictionary.

54:52.084 --> 54:53.834
There was time.

54:54.126 --> 54:58.459
But now,
I don't understand all that he says.

55:01.959 --> 55:05.542
You should drink lots of coffee.

55:07.084 --> 55:09.667
Will you go to the States?

55:10.751 --> 55:13.209
He sold everything there.

55:13.626 --> 55:15.084
He won't go back.

55:15.542 --> 55:17.417
Wow, sounds serious.

55:18.167 --> 55:19.917
It's funny.

55:20.209 --> 55:23.417
He took several long flights
to get here.

55:26.084 --> 55:30.126
Maybe he's on a wanted list there.
Maybe he's a terrorist.

55:30.417 --> 55:34.001
Watch your mouth!
I checked with the embassy.

55:35.876 --> 55:38.542
Does he miss home?

55:39.334 --> 55:40.792
I don't think so.

55:41.417 --> 55:42.667
Why?

55:44.334 --> 55:47.209
He's quiet and likes to be alone.

55:47.959 --> 55:50.334
He doesn't like the night life.

55:52.501 --> 55:55.834
Doesn't he get lonely?

55:56.126 --> 55:57.792
Who does he talk to?

55:58.417 --> 56:00.626
He has me to talk to.

56:00.917 --> 56:04.209
Are you full?
Do you want some custard?

56:05.167 --> 56:08.792
Does he look like his online picture?

56:10.167 --> 56:11.792
Well, he's a little fatter.

56:12.084 --> 56:13.459
How fat?

56:16.042 --> 56:18.251
Around this fat.

56:18.626 --> 56:22.792
If he's that fat,
he must be a high ranking soldier.

56:23.542 --> 56:26.001
But he's been retired for a while.

56:28.751 --> 56:30.876
Isn't it too hot for him here?

56:31.709 --> 56:33.251
Will you stop?

01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:40.584
Amongst humans, the most brilliant
are those who are disciplined.

01:06:42.834 --> 01:06:44.001
Honey?

01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:49.542
I'm the only one who's awake here.

01:07:00.376 --> 01:07:03.417
I just remember a homework...

01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:08.876
I forgot send to the teacher
long years ago.

01:07:13.626 --> 01:07:16.876
And also strange animal in the lake.

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:22.292
To this day,

01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:25.584
I don't know what it was.

01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:30.542
In the water it was weightless...

01:07:32.084 --> 01:07:33.667
and calm.

01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:39.126
It's now floating in my head...

01:07:41.084 --> 01:07:43.001
...in my heart.

01:07:44.084 --> 01:07:45.334
I...

01:08:24.209 --> 01:08:27.209
I'm glad you're up early today,
little pup.

01:08:29.292 --> 01:08:30.667
Me too.

01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:36.084
I'm a simple woman.

01:08:36.376 --> 01:08:38.376
I like to eat street food like this.

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:42.584
But if I'm with Richard,
we have to watch his cholesterol.

01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:45.209
What can't he eat?

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:50.501
Sticky rice, pork, not even Pepsi...

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:53.542
Is Pepsi high in cholesterol?

01:08:53.834 --> 01:08:54.834
Guess so.

01:08:55.126 --> 01:08:56.834
And pig's entrails.

01:08:57.126 --> 01:08:59.542
All intestines.

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:12.667
Hey, boy.

01:09:13.084 --> 01:09:14.334
Come here.

01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:19.334
Go away!

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:23.417
You're too kind.

01:09:25.584 --> 01:09:28.126
It's just hungry like us.

01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:35.876
I want to quit the army.

01:09:36.584 --> 01:09:38.334
What are you going to do?

01:09:40.084 --> 01:09:42.126
I'm good at many things.

01:09:42.751 --> 01:09:44.209
What are they?

01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:48.001
I want to sell moon cakes.
I make tasty ones.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:50.417
Taiwanese style.

01:09:51.209 --> 01:09:53.209
What is Taiwanese style like?

01:09:53.501 --> 01:09:56.584
Soft with a lot of egg whites.

01:09:57.292 --> 01:10:01.334
A thin crust
and a lot of green bean filling.

01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:06.667
I can sell them
at gas stations in Isan.

01:10:07.751 --> 01:10:10.334
That involves quite an investment.

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:14.542
I see no future in being a soldier.

01:10:15.626 --> 01:10:19.209
I mainly wash cars for the generals.

01:12:33.501 --> 01:12:35.542
Welcome everyone.

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:39.417
Ladies, gentlemen and children.

01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:41.334
My name is Jeed.

01:12:41.626 --> 01:12:45.209
I'm sure you recognise me from TV.

01:12:45.626 --> 01:12:48.417
I look just like Leena Jung.

01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:52.792
On TV and the radio.
And now I'm here in the flesh.

01:12:53.084 --> 01:12:55.959
I'm very happy to be here today.

01:12:56.251 --> 01:13:01.376
I want to show you
an unbelievable product.

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:03.251
It seems impossible.

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:05.001
But look at this.

01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:07.792
This is a piece of rubber.

01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:10.334
We can grow rubber in Thailand.

01:13:10.626 --> 01:13:13.626
What's amazing about this

01:13:13.917 --> 01:13:16.376
is that it's made from rubber

01:13:16.667 --> 01:13:20.209
but we can use it for our skin.

01:13:21.292 --> 01:13:24.084
Another thing is that

01:13:24.376 --> 01:13:29.167
it can rid us housewives
of the loneliness in our lives.

01:13:29.459 --> 01:13:32.251
Most of you are housewives.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:35.626
- Not this woman though.
- That's right.

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:38.584
- What do you do?
- I work at City Hall.

01:13:38.876 --> 01:13:41.834
A city official here in uniform.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:45.959
Thanks for skipping work to see me.
Please give her a big hand.

01:13:46.667 --> 01:13:47.959
Thank you.

01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:50.834
We have members nationwide.

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.792
I've travelled around the country.

01:13:54.084 --> 01:13:57.001
Khon Kaen women are so gorgeous.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.876
Do I look like I'm from Isan?

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:01.876
I don't look it, right?

01:14:03.209 --> 01:14:06.084
Because I'm too beautiful
to be from Isan?

01:14:06.376 --> 01:14:08.501
Every woman has beauty inside.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.834
I'm from Buriram Province.

01:14:11.126 --> 01:14:18.084
So I understand how Isan people feel.

01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:19.834
How they want to look.

01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:22.167
We have an emotional bond.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:24.792
What do I mean?

01:14:25.209 --> 01:14:27.626
It means
we can understand each other.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:31.626
This cream is certified
by Chulalongkorn University.

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:33.876
I'm not making it up.

01:14:35.959 --> 01:14:38.251
And now,
what you've been waiting for.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:43.001
You get to try this special cream.

01:14:43.667 --> 01:14:46.959
My assistants will hand out samples.

01:14:48.209 --> 01:14:49.626
Please come up here.

01:14:49.917 --> 01:14:51.626
Numbers 1 to 10.

01:14:51.917 --> 01:14:53.751
Numbers 11 to 30.

01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:56.126
If you didn't register, don't worry.

01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:59.334
There's enough for everyone.

01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:04.417
Give me your hand.
I'll apply it for you.

01:15:07.417 --> 01:15:09.001
Feels cool, right?

01:15:10.667 --> 01:15:12.792
Do you usually use hand cream?

01:15:13.959 --> 01:15:15.334
Try this.

01:15:15.626 --> 01:15:18.126
You only have to apply it once a day.

01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:20.001
Just once a day.

01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:23.667
Other creams you have to re-apply.

01:15:26.959 --> 01:15:29.417
Keng, is that you?

01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:32.001
I'm so happy to see you here!

01:15:32.417 --> 01:15:33.876
I saw you walking over.

01:15:34.584 --> 01:15:36.792
Really? Why are you here?

01:15:37.084 --> 01:15:39.542
To give you this gift, of course.

01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:42.126
- How nice.
- Open it.

01:15:45.501 --> 01:15:48.501
- Is this a legitimate product?
- Of course.

01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:53.501
You're here as a police spy, aren't you?

01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:56.876
Don't tell anyone.

01:15:57.501 --> 01:16:01.876
But you have to try it, sister.
Your skin will glow.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:06.876
This cream is for your face.

01:16:07.209 --> 01:16:09.542
But you can use it on your body.

01:16:09.876 --> 01:16:11.001
So you buy more.

01:16:11.292 --> 01:16:13.792
For a man, his skin is very smooth.

01:16:14.084 --> 01:16:16.167
Because he uses this cream.

01:16:16.459 --> 01:16:18.001
What did you use before?

01:16:18.584 --> 01:16:19.792
Generic stuff.

01:16:20.084 --> 01:16:21.792
Why did you switch to this one?

01:16:22.084 --> 01:16:23.626
Because it works.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:26.292
You let me try it for free.

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:30.751
So I tried it out, and it worked.

01:16:53.584 --> 01:16:55.001
What's wrong?

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:57.417
The smell.

01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:59.376
It smells like that fluid.

01:16:59.667 --> 01:17:00.959
What fluid?

01:17:01.251 --> 01:17:03.584
That stuff people call cum.

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:05.751
How could you think of that?

01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:08.209
Take a sniff.

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:15.417
- It smells like this?
- Yes.

01:17:20.292 --> 01:17:22.709
Oh, I can breathe easier.

01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:25.876
See? That's its power.

01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:28.334
My boobs are perking up.

01:17:28.626 --> 01:17:31.292
Don't tease me!

01:17:31.584 --> 01:17:33.209
But, it's true.

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:37.667
Read this.

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:46.292
The weather is perfect for a nap.

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.792
Let's have our daily session.

01:17:58.292 --> 01:18:00.292
We have bigger sets too.

01:18:00.584 --> 01:18:03.126
I can give you a discount.

01:18:04.501 --> 01:18:07.334
Let me finish this set first.

01:18:18.959 --> 01:18:23.001
He's asking me if you want to see.

01:18:24.626 --> 01:18:25.876
See what?

01:18:28.376 --> 01:18:30.001
What he's seeing.

01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:34.209
How can I see?

01:18:35.834 --> 01:18:37.792
Through my body.

01:18:40.959 --> 01:18:43.001
If so, then...

01:18:43.376 --> 01:18:46.667
This would be an amazing afternoon.

01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:51.542
Goodbye, sister.

01:19:04.376 --> 01:19:05.751
Hello.

01:19:11.084 --> 01:19:12.292
Itt?

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.959
I'm trying to believe that it's you.

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:22.001
Yes, I'm Itt.

01:19:25.376 --> 01:19:27.792
I'm standing in the throne hall.

01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:33.126
Is there anybody else with you?

01:19:38.876 --> 01:19:40.417
Come with me.

01:19:42.876 --> 01:19:44.417
Follow me.

01:19:59.834 --> 01:20:01.209
Where are we going?

01:20:06.876 --> 01:20:09.584
The ceiling here is not that high.

01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:12.792
It can be quite suffocating.

01:20:15.876 --> 01:20:17.126
Duck your head.

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:19.542
I don't think I'll hit it.

01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:24.959
You must come here often
when you sleep.

01:20:29.751 --> 01:20:31.001
What is it?

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.167
It's the threshold.

01:20:35.459 --> 01:20:36.792
Step over it.

01:20:37.084 --> 01:20:38.501
Like this?

01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:41.792
That's right.

01:20:42.084 --> 01:20:44.959
We have reached the Grand Hall.

01:20:45.251 --> 01:20:47.751
It's so lavish.

01:20:49.042 --> 01:20:51.376
There are many other rooms.

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:53.417
These are our orchids.

01:20:56.959 --> 01:21:00.126
The senior citizens club
organised them.

01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:03.792
We each grew one and took care of it.

01:21:04.417 --> 01:21:07.001
Something to keep us occupied.

01:21:14.626 --> 01:21:17.209
Here, this is my orchid.

01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:22.876
See? My name is on the sign.

01:21:28.084 --> 01:21:33.334
When it blooms, we use the bag
to protect it from insects.

01:21:34.209 --> 01:21:35.792
Let me help.

01:21:38.292 --> 01:21:39.834
You can have it.

01:21:40.126 --> 01:21:41.209
The bag?

01:21:41.626 --> 01:21:43.792
The flower, silly.

01:21:47.834 --> 01:21:49.542
It's not doing so well.

01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:52.001
I haven't been back for awhile.

01:21:53.501 --> 01:21:55.584
Let it breathe a little bit.

01:21:56.376 --> 01:21:57.584
Let's go.

01:22:08.959 --> 01:22:11.667
Itt, look at those figs.

01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:19.001
We should dip them in chilli sauce.

01:22:22.959 --> 01:22:24.001
Here.

01:22:24.876 --> 01:22:27.834
The flood marks from a few years ago.

01:22:28.126 --> 01:22:30.126
The water came up to here.

01:22:33.084 --> 01:22:34.542
Over here.

01:22:35.876 --> 01:22:39.209
This is a prince's dressing room.

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:43.667
It's full of mirrors.

01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:49.209
Why do they need so many mirrors?

01:22:52.209 --> 01:22:54.126
Palace intrigue, I guess.

01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:59.126
To see people sneaking up on them.

01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:04.334
Can you see me?

01:23:09.626 --> 01:23:11.542
Yes, from head to toe.

01:23:19.084 --> 01:23:21.001
How about here?

01:23:32.667 --> 01:23:33.751
Let's go.

01:23:52.292 --> 01:23:55.001
This is the golden bathroom.

01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:05.001
The sink is made from Burmese jade.

01:24:08.084 --> 01:24:11.001
So this was a royal bathroom?

01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:20.334
This is the foot basin.

01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:22.542
It's made of pink stone.

01:24:27.209 --> 01:24:29.876
Have you seen pink stone before?

01:24:32.959 --> 01:24:35.334
This is the first time in my life.

01:24:54.876 --> 01:24:57.334
Everything looks so luxurious.

01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:04.001
Bend down.

01:25:07.501 --> 01:25:09.584
We're next to the bed.

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:17.501
Its four legs
are carved like crocodile feet.

01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:25.126
I remember this place.

01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:26.959
Come here, Itt.

01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:28.667
Another leg.

01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:36.834
Wait...

01:25:37.126 --> 01:25:39.334
We're entering the music room.

01:25:42.751 --> 01:25:48.001
The mayor planned this place
to showcase the northeast region.

01:25:52.292 --> 01:25:54.959
But then the floods came.

01:25:56.876 --> 01:26:01.584
A tycoon the size of an ant
is always noticed.

01:26:01.876 --> 01:26:06.667
But a pauper as large as a mountain
is completely ignored.

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:14.001
Hunger for heaven
will lead you to hell.

01:26:19.042 --> 01:26:24.584
Time left unused... is the longest time.

01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:33.542
When we offend someone,
we want to be forgiven.

01:26:33.834 --> 01:26:38.542
But when we are offended,
we forget how to forgive.

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:53.959
Come take a look.

01:26:58.209 --> 01:27:02.501
This is like when I was young
in Nong Khai.

01:27:03.292 --> 01:27:07.959
Bombs were flying in from Laos.

01:27:09.084 --> 01:27:11.876
I can remember the siren.

01:28:05.376 --> 01:28:07.667
Itt, come here.

01:28:21.042 --> 01:28:22.542
Isn't it profound?

01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:28.584
I used to come here often,
when I was confused.

01:28:30.501 --> 01:28:32.584
What were you confused about?

01:28:33.209 --> 01:28:35.126
Mostly about love.

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:39.959
Are you still confused?

01:28:42.626 --> 01:28:45.334
You should know, my little pup.

01:29:09.292 --> 01:29:11.584
They outdid my palace decor.

01:29:14.417 --> 01:29:16.417
But I prefer your palace.

01:29:21.876 --> 01:29:23.126
Comfortable?

01:29:23.501 --> 01:29:25.001
Better.

01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:32.667
You know my first husband
was also a soldier?

01:29:34.667 --> 01:29:38.542
His name was Narong,
Corporal Narong Jansuda.

01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:44.209
When I was twenty,
I eloped with him.

01:29:45.959 --> 01:29:47.501
A monster...

01:29:55.417 --> 01:29:57.667
You're a soldier magnet!

01:29:59.084 --> 01:30:01.001
And one without borders.

01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:04.751
But I'd prefer a European husband.

01:30:05.084 --> 01:30:07.584
Americans are too poor.

01:30:08.876 --> 01:30:13.126
Europeans
are living the American dream.

01:30:28.667 --> 01:30:33.376
The breath of love that never fades

01:30:33.667 --> 01:30:38.834
Not lonesome am I, my dear

01:30:39.126 --> 01:30:43.126
Though the many years that pass by

01:30:43.584 --> 01:30:50.126
My heart is still full of love

01:30:51.417 --> 01:30:59.417
Those days... alone... you and me...

01:30:59.751 --> 01:31:02.334
Every night from now

01:31:02.626 --> 01:31:07.542
The stars shine in our favour forever

01:31:09.876 --> 01:31:15.126
Heaven was created for us to meet

01:31:15.417 --> 01:31:20.501
Heaven is destroyed for us if we part

01:31:20.792 --> 01:31:24.376
But freedom is in my body

01:31:24.667 --> 01:31:30.667
While destiny fills my heart

01:31:32.084 --> 01:31:36.834
The heaven inside my heart

01:31:37.126 --> 01:31:42.334
Through summer and spring with you

01:31:42.876 --> 01:31:46.709
The memory of winter

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:53.667
I miss you... you who were here...

01:31:54.417 --> 01:31:59.292
The breath of love that never fades

01:31:59.584 --> 01:32:04.542
Not lonesome am I, my dear

01:32:04.959 --> 01:32:09.001
Though the many years that pass by

01:32:09.417 --> 01:32:16.334
My heart is still full of love

01:32:30.626 --> 01:32:33.876
This is my favourite song, Itt.

01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:55.667
- What is it?
- Something in your eye.

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:06.876
I think I'm dreaming, Itt.

01:33:08.751 --> 01:33:11.542
I just want to wake up.

01:33:16.292 --> 01:33:20.959
Then just open your eyes wide.
Like this.

01:33:28.959 --> 01:33:30.292
Wider.

01:33:42.667 --> 01:33:44.126
Very good.

01:33:46.417 --> 01:33:47.792
Jen...

01:33:48.751 --> 01:33:50.626
Of all the places we've been,

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:54.001
this is by far the most opulent.

01:33:55.876 --> 01:33:59.209
But devoid of decoration.

01:34:00.751 --> 01:34:02.792
Not even gold?

01:34:03.667 --> 01:34:04.792
No!

01:34:07.376 --> 01:34:11.584
From here you can see
the most fertile lands.

01:34:13.667 --> 01:34:17.584
Fields full of rice
and rivers full of fish.

01:34:22.626 --> 01:34:24.334
It looks lonely.

01:34:30.876 --> 01:34:34.876
I see everything clearly now, Itt.

01:34:35.292 --> 01:34:36.542
Yes?

01:34:40.376 --> 01:34:43.292
At the heart of the kingdom,

01:34:44.292 --> 01:34:46.542
other than rice fields,

01:34:47.084 --> 01:34:49.001
there is nothing.

01:35:24.959 --> 01:35:26.751
You will live long, Itt.

01:35:27.084 --> 01:35:30.792
Our metabolism slows while we sleep.

01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:34.417
Save yourself for a better future.

01:38:19.667 --> 01:38:21.584
Where are you now, Itt?

01:38:22.292 --> 01:38:24.209
Underground or here?

01:38:29.876 --> 01:38:31.417
Both, I guess.

01:38:34.876 --> 01:38:36.001
Look at this.

01:38:41.501 --> 01:38:43.334
Does it look scary to you?

01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:45.126
I don't think so.

01:38:45.417 --> 01:38:47.209
There's more.

01:38:52.501 --> 01:38:54.751
- Does it hurt here?
- Not really.

01:38:58.959 --> 01:39:00.334
How about here?

01:39:00.667 --> 01:39:04.001
No, only with certain movements.

01:39:06.209 --> 01:39:10.001
The surgery costs
100,000 Baht per centimetre.

01:39:10.376 --> 01:39:15.001
My right leg is 10 cm shorter
than the left.

01:39:16.876 --> 01:39:19.334
Just shorten the other leg then.

01:39:20.084 --> 01:39:22.667
I knew you'd say that.

01:39:23.959 --> 01:39:25.334
See?

01:39:26.084 --> 01:39:28.001
I can read your mind.

01:39:31.959 --> 01:39:33.751
Here, Jen.

01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:36.834
I can sense every smell here.

01:39:37.126 --> 01:39:38.667
Really?

01:39:41.626 --> 01:39:43.209
What next?

01:39:45.417 --> 01:39:49.501
"I can feel the temperature
of the lights."

01:39:50.376 --> 01:39:53.667
I can feel the temperature
of the lights.

01:39:54.584 --> 01:39:57.209
Then you must be Superman.

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:02.334
"And the flower in my dream."

01:40:03.667 --> 01:40:06.792
I could really smell the flower
in my dream.

01:40:12.667 --> 01:40:15.542
This is Richard's.

01:40:16.876 --> 01:40:23.001
For his brain,
to fight Alzheimer's and arthritis.

01:40:23.876 --> 01:40:25.792
This is goji berry.

01:40:29.959 --> 01:40:32.292
Ginkgo biloba.

01:40:33.084 --> 01:40:34.792
Mix them together.

01:40:37.626 --> 01:40:42.834
Richard used to break dishes a lot.

01:40:43.126 --> 01:40:44.834
They'd slip from his hands.

01:40:45.126 --> 01:40:49.667
After drinking this,
he doesn't drop things anymore.

01:40:54.876 --> 01:40:57.876
It helps me stay awake.

01:40:59.084 --> 01:41:01.001
You won't fall asleep again.

01:41:04.626 --> 01:41:05.792
Try it.

01:41:06.417 --> 01:41:09.834
What if I wake at the pavilion
and go back home,

01:41:10.126 --> 01:41:11.792
will you be OK with that?

01:41:12.209 --> 01:41:13.417
Sure.

01:41:15.584 --> 01:41:18.001
You know, when you're asleep,

01:41:19.584 --> 01:41:23.876
even the bright city lights
feel dull.

01:41:29.084 --> 01:41:31.876
No one has said that to me before.

01:41:36.626 --> 01:41:38.126
Drink it.

01:41:38.876 --> 01:41:40.251
No, thanks.

01:41:40.542 --> 01:41:41.959
What are you doing?

01:41:44.959 --> 01:41:46.542
What are you doing?

01:41:53.084 --> 01:41:54.959
It's therapy.

01:41:59.292 --> 01:42:01.334
Can you sense the energy?

01:42:03.751 --> 01:42:05.584
It tickles.

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:13.792
Why are you pouring it out?

01:42:14.584 --> 01:42:16.334
Trust me.

01:42:20.584 --> 01:42:22.001
Stop it!

01:42:40.042 --> 01:42:41.876
It's full of germs.

01:42:48.292 --> 01:42:50.417
You're like a little puppy.

01:45:46.626 --> 01:45:48.126
Jen...

01:45:49.292 --> 01:45:50.417
Jen.

01:46:30.959 --> 01:46:32.001
Jen...

01:46:35.292 --> 01:46:37.126
Tell me what you see.

01:46:59.626 --> 01:47:01.292
Where are you?

01:47:08.876 --> 01:47:10.126
What?

01:47:26.376 --> 01:47:27.959
I'm not sure.

01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:17.334
Suddenly, I can read your mind.

01:48:20.959 --> 01:48:23.334
I have seen your dream.

01:48:36.417 --> 01:48:38.501
And I have seen yours.

01:48:42.959 --> 01:48:45.417
Don't fall asleep yet, please.

01:48:57.667 --> 01:49:00.667
Do you know what they're digging for?

01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:06.292
It's a secret government project.

01:49:08.959 --> 01:49:12.959
It's so secret,
that they're digging out in the open.

01:49:17.084 --> 01:49:20.126
Soon, they will move us away.

01:49:21.667 --> 01:49:23.876
I'd prefer to sleep here.

01:49:37.876 --> 01:49:41.584
You're right.
This is a good place to sleep.

01:50:55.042 --> 01:50:58.501
There's a mountain of bricks.

01:50:59.209 --> 01:51:05.001
It spreads out like a flower blossom.

01:51:06.834 --> 01:51:10.126
It stretches to the sky.

01:51:11.209 --> 01:51:13.417
To devour the sun.

01:51:15.667 --> 01:51:18.001
It is very far away.

01:51:20.084 --> 01:51:22.959
It looks ominous and fearsome.

01:51:27.292 --> 01:51:29.001
It pretends to be...

01:51:30.876 --> 01:51:35.417
a pure and flawless being.

01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:42.876
Pretends to be as soft as a child's palm.

01:51:48.292 --> 01:51:50.292
Before it disappears,

01:51:51.959 --> 01:51:53.876
the wall bulges

01:51:54.501 --> 01:51:56.292
and changes shape.

01:51:59.959 --> 01:52:03.876
As if it knows, that when it falls,

01:52:05.376 --> 01:52:08.876
it would be an astounding sight to behold.

02:00:34.209 --> 02:00:36.959
Subtitling: Monal Group
