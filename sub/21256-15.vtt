WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:01.540
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.541 --> 00:04.096
- Everything okay?
- Tess asked me for a separation.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.533
- Why would she do this?
- What if I'm gay?

00:06.568 --> 00:10.170
- What is this?
- It's a mild sedative, for anxiety.

00:10.205 --> 00:13.073
Honey, that necklace is not your mom.

00:14.676 --> 00:17.444
Okay, we're leaving!
Don't stay up too late.

00:17.479 --> 00:20.047
See you in the morning.

00:24.853 --> 00:27.020
Lena felt terrible telling Jesus

00:27.055 --> 00:28.699
she couldn't be his
para-professional anymore,

00:28.723 --> 00:30.334
but, uh, you know, the
teachers were up in arms

00:30.358 --> 00:31.502
about her being in the classrooms,

00:31.526 --> 00:33.470
which I'm sure Jesus wasn't
thrilled about either.

00:33.494 --> 00:35.472
Of course he's not thrilled
about having a new para,

00:35.496 --> 00:37.696
but if he wants to
finish his junior year

00:37.731 --> 00:40.332
and be a senior next year,
then he... he's got to have one.

00:41.402 --> 00:44.002
Anything else?

00:44.038 --> 00:47.039
Um, my friend Jenna,
I told you about her.

00:47.075 --> 00:49.808
She came by to make up, so to speak,

00:49.843 --> 00:52.051
and, uh, let me know
that nothing was going on

00:52.052 --> 00:53.745
between her and, uh, Tess,

00:53.781 --> 00:56.615
which, uh, you know, I don't
know if I exactly believe,

00:56.650 --> 00:58.650
but whatever, that's Jenna.

00:58.686 --> 00:59.984
Would it bother you

00:59.985 --> 01:03.121
if there was something going
on between Jenna and Tess?

01:03.156 --> 01:05.835
Oh, what bothers me is that Tess
is keeping her husband in the dark.

01:05.859 --> 01:08.961
You know, he has no idea
what the hell is happening.

01:08.996 --> 01:12.863
Was Mike in the dark?
About your sexuality?

01:12.899 --> 01:16.834
Uh, um, Mike has
nothing to do with this.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.837
Well, it just seems that your situation

01:19.872 --> 01:21.806
was similar to Tess's.

01:21.841 --> 01:24.842
You're married to a man,
questioning your sexuality.

01:26.379 --> 01:28.679
How did you feel about
ending your marriage?

01:30.516 --> 01:32.883
Uh, I felt badly.

01:32.919 --> 01:34.752
For Mike, I certainly
didn't mean to hurt him.

01:34.787 --> 01:36.286
And, uh, for my son.

01:37.323 --> 01:39.624
Uh, he was only five,

01:39.659 --> 01:41.158
but it's, uh...

01:42.194 --> 01:44.661
It's pretty hard...

01:44.696 --> 01:47.631
to tell your son, your
little boy, that...

01:47.666 --> 01:49.466
you all won't be living together...

01:51.137 --> 01:54.638
in the same house anymore.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.440
Didn't have much support from my family.

01:56.475 --> 01:58.842
I didn't have much support
from my parents. Um...

02:00.411 --> 02:04.114
When I came out, my father
didn't speak to me for a year.

02:08.318 --> 02:11.054
Uh, so...

02:11.089 --> 02:16.225
uh, when you ask me how I felt, I...

02:18.496 --> 02:20.329
I felt, uh...

02:22.333 --> 02:24.167
Ashamed?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.671
Unlike guilt,

02:28.706 --> 02:32.141
which is the feeling of
doing something wrong...

02:32.177 --> 02:34.877
shame is the feeling of
being something wrong.

02:35.913 --> 02:38.947
And this assault on the self...

02:38.983 --> 02:42.450
it can cause deep depression
and severe anxiety.

- She should be here any minute, Jesus.
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.066 --> 03:34.201
I'm gonna keep a close eye on
this para, honey, I promise.

03:34.237 --> 03:36.437
Yeah, you and everyone else, Mama.

03:36.472 --> 03:37.676
I mean, you have no idea what it's like

03:37.677 --> 03:39.250
having everyone just staring at you,

03:39.274 --> 03:42.809
wondering why some old
fart's following you around.

03:44.346 --> 03:45.879
Fartess, excuse me.

03:45.914 --> 03:48.248
- Hi.
- Sorry, I'm a bit early.

03:48.283 --> 03:50.717
- Would you like me to wait?
- No, no, please come on in.

03:50.753 --> 03:52.853
Um, Priya, this is my son, Jesus.

03:52.888 --> 03:54.821
Jesus, this is your new para.

03:57.592 --> 03:59.225
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:59.261 --> 04:00.638
It's really nice to meet you, Jesus.

04:00.662 --> 04:02.729
Hi, uh, me too.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.031
Uh, you. Nice to meet you.

04:12.306 --> 04:15.074
Oh, it's beautiful.

04:15.109 --> 04:16.575
Are you sure you like it?

04:17.812 --> 04:19.278
Yeah, it's...

04:19.313 --> 04:20.779
really beautiful.

04:20.815 --> 04:23.983
I just wanted to give
you something special.

04:24.018 --> 04:26.618
You know, for everything that
you've done for me and my family.

04:26.654 --> 04:28.220
I know it's not much, um...

04:28.256 --> 04:31.022
No, it's... No, it's really lovely.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.526
- You didn't have to.
- No, I wanted to.

04:34.561 --> 04:37.195
Callie? Oh, sorry.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.898
Oh, no, that's okay. I've
got to get to derby practice.

04:39.933 --> 04:42.267
I'll talk to you later.

04:42.303 --> 04:44.035
Ah, yeah, yeah.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.469
- Hey, thanks.
- Yeah.

04:48.108 --> 04:49.340
What's that?

04:49.375 --> 04:51.409
A necklace.

04:51.444 --> 04:52.944
Ximena gave it to me.

04:54.114 --> 04:55.546
It's pretty.

04:55.581 --> 04:56.681
Yeah, I know.

04:56.716 --> 05:00.118
I just didn't have the heart to tell her

05:00.153 --> 05:01.919
I only wear Mom's locket.

05:04.657 --> 05:06.657
Um, why are you home early?

05:06.693 --> 05:08.258
Eighth grade teacher conferences.

05:09.462 --> 05:11.395
Speaking of Mom...

05:11.431 --> 05:12.991
can we visit her grave on Mother's Day?

05:14.266 --> 05:17.702
We're all making brunch
for Moms and Sharon, so...

05:17.737 --> 05:20.037
Well, couldn't we go
like before or after?

05:20.072 --> 05:21.872
No, I don't think we'll have time.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.874
We can go another day.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.943
What other day?

05:25.978 --> 05:28.745
Jude, it's not, like, she's there.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.647
You know, she doesn't
know what day it is.

05:31.851 --> 05:35.552
We need to be here for our Moms that do.

05:35.587 --> 05:37.286
Okay?

05:41.025 --> 05:42.959
Twenty-eight,

05:42.994 --> 05:44.627
twenty-nine,

05:44.663 --> 05:45.995
thirty.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.797
End time.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.834
So, what does this do?

05:50.869 --> 05:53.502
We're working on building
up your ability to focus,

05:53.537 --> 05:57.506
by starting with short periods
of time and building on that.

05:57.541 --> 06:00.209
Thirty seconds of complete focus

06:00.245 --> 06:03.946
can be far more productive
than 30 minutes of struggle.

06:03.982 --> 06:05.114
That makes sense.

06:05.149 --> 06:07.027
I'm gonna go ask Craig
for tomorrow's assignment.

06:07.051 --> 06:09.885
- That way we can plan ahead.
- Okay. Thanks.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.810
_

06:34.945 --> 06:36.811
- What's up, dude?
- Hey.

06:36.846 --> 06:39.281
- Where's your hottie?
- Oh, she went home for the day.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.383
For real, Foster. I'd take a nail
in the head to nail that any day.

06:42.419 --> 06:45.420
But, like, how do you focus with
her rack in your face all day?

06:45.455 --> 06:48.355
Well, I... yeah.

06:48.391 --> 06:50.791
I'd probably focus a little bit
better if she sat on my face.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.629
Uh, see you later, dude.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.230
- Peace.
- Seriously?

06:56.265 --> 06:58.399
- What?
- You're disgusting.

07:03.306 --> 07:04.704
Hey.

07:04.740 --> 07:08.075
Hey, listen, I would...

07:08.110 --> 07:10.144
I would really like it
if we did not discuss

07:10.179 --> 07:12.346
what's been going on with
me in front of my mother.

07:12.381 --> 07:14.481
She'll just poo-poo it as nonsense.

07:14.516 --> 07:16.883
- Okay.
- And speaking of the devil...

07:16.919 --> 07:18.652
Um, where is she?

07:18.687 --> 07:20.607
She's supposed to have
gotten in a few hours ago.

07:22.724 --> 07:24.925
Hello, hello!

07:24.960 --> 07:26.626
Hi.

07:26.662 --> 07:28.528
Hi!

07:28.564 --> 07:31.364
- That's a nice wig, Ma.
- Oh, come on, hair!

07:31.399 --> 07:32.698
It's the real me!

07:32.733 --> 07:34.878
- Looks good, no?
- Where's your, uh, where's your baggage?

07:34.902 --> 07:37.170
Oh, um, oh!

07:37.205 --> 07:38.304
I left it next door!

07:38.340 --> 07:40.606
Next door? What are
they doing next door?

07:40.641 --> 07:42.842
Oh, as I was coming
in from the taxi cab,

07:42.877 --> 07:46.045
Tess was coming in in
her big, ol' fancy Tesla.

07:46.081 --> 07:48.380
- Tess in her Tesla.
- Ma.

07:48.415 --> 07:50.983
Have you seen the way that
the doors go up on that?

07:51.018 --> 07:53.251
- It's like a crazy spaceship.
- Yes. So...

07:53.287 --> 07:54.832
You were... Why were you at Tess's, Mom?

07:54.856 --> 07:57.623
Oh, well, I didn't see
your car in the driveway,

07:57.658 --> 07:59.970
and Tess said, "Come on in and
have a glass of wine," so...

07:59.994 --> 08:03.061
Hey, why didn't you ever tell
me before she's a lesbian?

08:03.097 --> 08:04.796
Oh, boy.

08:04.831 --> 08:06.098
She told you that?

08:07.401 --> 08:10.568
You know, Stefanie, it
might come as a surprise,

08:10.604 --> 08:15.140
but some people actually
like to confide in me.

08:15.175 --> 08:19.711
And guess what? Tomorrow
night, we're going to a gay bar.

08:24.117 --> 08:27.020
- Do you need some help with your homework?
- Uh, yeah.

08:27.894 --> 08:29.672
Do you want to write this
practice college essay?

08:29.696 --> 08:31.263
What's the question?

08:31.298 --> 08:33.097
"What event or experience

08:33.133 --> 08:35.099
has had the greatest
impact on your life?"

08:36.702 --> 08:37.902
I'm gonna write about my TBI.

08:37.937 --> 08:39.503
That's great.

08:39.538 --> 08:40.950
You should have plenty
to say about that.

08:40.974 --> 08:43.975
Yeah, it's just how to say it, you know?

08:47.713 --> 08:50.614
"Your para's got a nice pair-a tits."

08:50.650 --> 08:53.016
Yeah, uh, some guy passed
me that in class today.

08:54.687 --> 08:56.052
Well, what did you say to him?

08:56.088 --> 08:58.922
- Um...
- He said that he wanted Priya to sit on his face.

08:58.957 --> 09:00.824
- Mariana!
- What?

09:00.859 --> 09:01.859
You did, I heard you.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.572
Jesus, why would you
say something like that?

09:03.596 --> 09:05.728
Mama, it's just, like, guy talk.

09:05.764 --> 09:07.813
- "Guy talk"?
- Yeah, I mean, they started it.

09:07.814 --> 09:08.814
What do you want me to say?

09:08.820 --> 09:10.687
That it's completely inappropriate.

09:10.702 --> 09:14.171
- Yeah, right. I...
- What is so crazy about that?

09:14.206 --> 09:16.739
Fine, then get me another para.

09:16.775 --> 09:18.574
One that's not mean or hot.

09:18.610 --> 09:20.811
Look, I can barely
handle school as it is,

09:20.846 --> 09:23.212
I cannot deal with all this other stuff.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.718
So, what should I wear to a lesbian bar?

09:28.753 --> 09:31.621
Is there some kind of, you
know, dress code or something?

09:31.656 --> 09:34.190
- You know, Mother...
- You're going to a lesbian bar?

09:34.225 --> 09:35.525
Well, I feel like dancing,

09:35.560 --> 09:37.860
and I just don't want
to get hit on all night.

09:37.895 --> 09:39.301
Well, what makes you think
the ladies won't hit on you?

09:39.302 --> 09:41.363
Oh, good point!

09:41.398 --> 09:43.799
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks!

09:45.069 --> 09:46.969
Lena, would you like
to go with us tonight?

09:47.004 --> 09:48.637
Uh, no, thank you.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.239
Okay, well.

09:50.274 --> 09:52.308
Stef, finished? You
don't have to come either.

09:52.343 --> 09:55.477
I mean, Tess and I'll
be fine on our own.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.779
That's what I'm afraid of.

09:57.815 --> 09:59.948
So, looks like I'll have to find Jesus

09:59.983 --> 10:02.283
yet another para-professional.

10:02.319 --> 10:04.219
Why, what happened?
The new one's no good?

10:04.254 --> 10:05.821
No, she's very good.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.188
The problem is, she's too hot.

10:07.224 --> 10:08.457
Hot?

10:09.593 --> 10:11.826
Yeah, Jesus's friends are teasing him.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.505
Which is why I didn't
hire her to begin with

10:13.529 --> 10:15.341
because I thought she might
be a distraction for him.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.631
Well, you're hot. Do you think
you shouldn't be principal

10:17.667 --> 10:19.968
simply because boys won't behave?

10:20.003 --> 10:22.303
Yeah! I agree.

10:22.339 --> 10:25.806
I mean, girls should be judged
on their brains, not their bod.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.709
That's why I raised
her to be a feminist.

10:28.745 --> 10:30.723
Well, we shouldn't just raise
our daughters to be feminists.

10:30.747 --> 10:32.458
We should raise our
sons to be feminists too.

10:32.482 --> 10:34.526
And you... you really think you
raised me to be a feminist, Ma?

10:34.550 --> 10:36.116
Of course, I do.

10:39.955 --> 10:41.555
Okay.

10:45.294 --> 10:46.426
Erase that.

10:46.461 --> 10:48.428
- What?
- Just do it.

10:49.698 --> 10:51.798
"Erase that." Okay.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.166
Oh, I can still see it.

10:53.202 --> 10:56.103
- Here, try again.
- Well, I can't make it go away completely.

10:56.138 --> 10:57.938
Yeah, exactly.

10:57.973 --> 10:59.639
Piece of paper is just like your virtue.

10:59.674 --> 11:02.074
Once you make a mark on it,
you can try and try to erase it,

11:02.110 --> 11:03.610
but it's never gonna go away.

11:03.645 --> 11:05.857
You had me do that when I was
a girl, Ma, you remember that?

11:05.881 --> 11:08.648
Well, I'm sure I was just trying
to scare you a little or something,

11:08.683 --> 11:10.817
so you wouldn't go out
and get yourself pregnant.

11:10.852 --> 11:11.852
Well, I never forgot it, Ma,

11:11.860 --> 11:13.977
and it certainly didn't
make me feel like a feminist.

11:13.988 --> 11:18.190
It made me feel like sex was
shameful, especially for girls.

11:19.627 --> 11:21.405
Boys and girls are raised
with double standards.

11:21.429 --> 11:23.963
And I don't think that we
should give our sons a free pass.

11:23.998 --> 11:25.798
If we're complicit in this behavior,

11:25.833 --> 11:27.133
if just say "boys will be boys"

11:27.168 --> 11:29.135
then, you know, we're...
we're misogynists, too.

11:31.940 --> 11:35.240
- She's right.
- She's also very wound up.

11:35.275 --> 11:38.009
I mean, more than usual.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.778
Is anything going on with her?

11:39.814 --> 11:42.247
No, she's fine.

11:43.517 --> 11:45.762
Your fever broke, and you're
not having other side effects,

11:45.786 --> 11:47.686
which is a good sign
that the modified T-cells

11:47.722 --> 11:49.254
aren't attacking your immune system,

11:49.289 --> 11:51.756
and hopefully just the cancer cells.

11:51.791 --> 11:54.259
I'll check back tomorrow.

11:54.294 --> 11:56.694
- Actually, Doctor, do you have a sec?
- Absolutely.

12:02.369 --> 12:05.003
It's great how quick
the treatment works.

12:06.306 --> 12:07.705
If it works.

12:09.576 --> 12:10.842
It will.

12:15.482 --> 12:17.081
I made you my proxy.

12:18.351 --> 12:20.518
What... what's that?

12:21.688 --> 12:25.722
The person who makes all
of my medical decisions

12:25.758 --> 12:27.524
on my behalf if I can't.

12:32.464 --> 12:34.265
Shouldn't your mother be that person?

12:34.300 --> 12:36.100
No, I... I don't want
her being that person,

12:36.135 --> 12:39.003
because I don't think
she'll do what I want...

12:39.038 --> 12:40.169
if things go bad.

12:40.205 --> 12:43.540
Which is why I need
you to be that person.

12:48.246 --> 12:50.580
Everything was fine in Baltimore.

12:50.616 --> 12:53.617
And then we moved here, and it's
like, boom. My dad's moving out.

12:53.652 --> 12:57.053
- Do you think the move had anything to do with it?
- I don't know.

12:58.489 --> 13:00.089
I don't want to talk about it.

13:02.493 --> 13:04.827
I just wish I knew why. What happened?

13:04.862 --> 13:06.629
You know, no one's telling me anything,

13:06.664 --> 13:08.631
and my mom is acting so...

13:11.502 --> 13:12.935
What are you doing tomorrow?

13:12.970 --> 13:14.303
For Mother's Day?

13:14.338 --> 13:15.516
I hadn't even thought about that.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.050
I guess we won't be
spending it with my dad.

13:17.074 --> 13:18.808
Well...

13:18.843 --> 13:20.643
why don't you spend it with us?

13:20.678 --> 13:22.478
We're making brunch
for my moms and grandma.

13:22.513 --> 13:24.313
Are you sure it's okay?

13:24.348 --> 13:26.482
I mean, she's out with my mom tonight.

13:26.517 --> 13:27.883
She might get sick of her.

13:29.086 --> 13:30.618
Wait. Your...

13:30.654 --> 13:32.887
Your mom's out with them tonight?

13:32.923 --> 13:35.324
- Dancing?
- Yeah, I guess.

13:49.806 --> 13:52.206
Okay, now the first round is on me.

13:52.241 --> 13:54.681
- What do you want?
- I'll have some soda water, please.

13:54.711 --> 13:57.078
- Soda water?
- I'm driving, Mother.

13:57.113 --> 13:58.913
Okay, fine. What would you like, honey?

13:58.949 --> 14:00.849
Uh, margarita, rocks, no salt.

14:00.884 --> 14:02.583
That's my girl!

14:04.020 --> 14:06.687
So, it's official,
huh? You're a lesbian?

14:06.722 --> 14:09.156
I'm not... I haven't...

14:09.192 --> 14:11.092
I'm exploring.

14:11.127 --> 14:14.095
Ah, well, my mom said that
you told her you're a lesbian.

14:15.164 --> 14:17.064
Would it bother you if I was gay?

14:17.100 --> 14:18.899
Or is it just that I haven't told Dean?

14:18.934 --> 14:20.411
Because I haven't even kissed a woman,

14:20.435 --> 14:22.675
so I don't even know if there's
anything to tell him yet.

14:23.606 --> 14:26.072
Did you tell your husband
before you really knew?

14:26.108 --> 14:28.074
Hey. Hey, hey, Tess.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.044
Check it out.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.548
The girl at my...

14:34.583 --> 14:37.283
Six o'clock, end of the bar.

14:37.319 --> 14:38.551
What do you think?

14:38.586 --> 14:41.654
Yeah, yeah. She's... she's attractive.

14:41.689 --> 14:43.956
And alone! Come on,
let's go talk to her.

14:43.992 --> 14:45.858
- No! What, no!
- Oh, come on.

14:45.894 --> 14:47.927
Somebody's gotta be the man here.

14:47.962 --> 14:49.896
Nobody has to be the man, Mother.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.531
You know what I'm talking about.

14:51.566 --> 14:52.865
- I don't!
- The aggressor.

14:55.003 --> 14:56.836
I'm just sayin'.

14:56.871 --> 14:58.070
You say a lot.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.082
How's it going?

15:10.117 --> 15:12.651
Um, it's slow.

15:17.425 --> 15:19.358
So, uh...

15:19.393 --> 15:21.760
I've been thinking about
the Priya situation.

15:22.763 --> 15:24.729
And I'm really sorry.

15:26.232 --> 15:28.132
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

15:28.168 --> 15:31.502
Because... I hired David

15:31.538 --> 15:33.972
instead of Priya the first time around.

15:34.007 --> 15:35.451
Even though I knew
she was more qualified,

15:35.475 --> 15:38.677
and I did that because I'm sexist.

15:38.712 --> 15:41.145
And I thought that she might
be a distraction for you.

15:44.050 --> 15:46.584
- I mean, you're right.
- No, I was wrong.

15:46.619 --> 15:49.253
To assume that you couldn't
rise above locker-room talk,

15:49.289 --> 15:50.689
and be the man we raised you to be.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.625
A man who... who has the courage to...

15:54.660 --> 15:56.060
to stand up to his friends and say,

15:56.096 --> 15:58.829
"No, it's not okay to
sexually harass women."

15:58.864 --> 16:00.130
Physically or verbally.

16:00.165 --> 16:02.132
To their faces or behind their backs.

16:02.167 --> 16:04.167
But you're a man, who not
only respects his moms,

16:04.203 --> 16:05.703
and his sisters, and his girlfriend,

16:05.738 --> 16:07.537
but all women.

16:07.573 --> 16:09.473
That's who I believe you are.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.409
That's who I hope you are.

16:15.547 --> 16:17.147
So...

16:17.182 --> 16:19.549
I'm not gonna tell Priya
that it's not working out.

16:19.585 --> 16:22.185
And if you can't show her
the respect she deserves,

16:22.221 --> 16:24.787
you can tell her that yourself.

16:24.823 --> 16:26.956
And you can tell her why.

16:35.003 --> 16:36.520
She must really trust you.

16:39.651 --> 16:42.619
I... I don't know if I could...
if I could do it, though.

16:42.654 --> 16:43.819
You know?

16:43.855 --> 16:45.255
Like...

16:47.325 --> 16:48.991
pull the plug, or whatever.

16:53.865 --> 16:55.698
Then you should tell her that.

17:07.478 --> 17:09.478
Is Tess gay?

17:09.512 --> 17:11.313
Is that why she made
Logan's dad move out?

17:12.348 --> 17:13.883
Why are you asking this?

17:13.917 --> 17:17.519
Because she's out with Sharon
and Mom at a lesbian bar, right?

17:17.554 --> 17:21.690
Honey, there are lots of reasons
why a marriage breaks down.

17:21.724 --> 17:23.191
Like if one person's gay?

17:23.226 --> 17:25.926
Look, it all makes sense.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.195
She moved back here, next to Mom,

17:28.231 --> 17:29.660
and she realized she
actually did have feelings

17:29.661 --> 17:31.010
for her back in high school,

17:31.034 --> 17:32.333
- and boom.
- Look.

17:32.368 --> 17:34.002
We don't know anything for sure.

17:34.037 --> 17:36.637
Tess is just exploring her options.

17:36.673 --> 17:39.373
Well, I hope she's not exploring Mom.

17:39.409 --> 17:42.376
- Hey!
- I'm just saying.

17:42.412 --> 17:43.978
I wouldn't let my wife

17:44.014 --> 17:45.746
go to a gay bar with her first love

17:45.782 --> 17:47.415
who's in an exploring kind of mood.

17:47.450 --> 17:52.219
Listen, your mother
and I are very married.

17:52.254 --> 17:55.423
And look, I don't want you
telling any of this to Logan.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.326
- It's none our business.
- Okay, fine.

18:08.070 --> 18:11.038
I just wanted to thank
you for the drink.

18:11.073 --> 18:12.539
Oh, um...

18:14.476 --> 18:16.977
You're welcome.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.946
I'm Lara.

18:18.981 --> 18:20.513
Would you like to dance?

18:21.950 --> 18:23.149
She'd love to!

18:26.588 --> 18:28.054
Um...

18:29.290 --> 18:30.423
Sure.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.092
Come on.

18:40.568 --> 18:42.935
Stef, look, I'm really
sorry about the whole,

18:42.971 --> 18:45.537
uh, white paper/virtue thing.

18:45.573 --> 18:47.039
If I'd known you were a lesbian,

18:47.075 --> 18:49.075
I would never have done that.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.543
Why didn't you? Huh?

18:51.579 --> 18:53.145
I don't know. I...

18:53.181 --> 18:55.681
You wore dresses. I'm not omniscient.

18:55.716 --> 18:58.083
Hey! So, you wanna dance?

18:58.118 --> 19:00.018
No, thank you.

19:00.053 --> 19:01.854
Um, not you.

19:03.691 --> 19:04.890
Me?

19:04.925 --> 19:07.526
Well, I'd love to.

19:08.962 --> 19:10.661
You're not a lesbian,
you know that, Mom?

19:10.697 --> 19:13.365
- Remember Will?
- Oh, Stefanie.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.001
I've had experiences.

19:42.729 --> 19:44.161
Good morning.

19:45.398 --> 19:48.432
- What was that for?
- Just 'cause.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.100
Good morning.

19:50.136 --> 19:51.601
How'd you sleep?

19:51.637 --> 19:53.437
Good!

19:53.472 --> 19:54.972
- Who wants eggs?
- Me!

19:55.007 --> 19:56.573
Yes, I'll have some.

19:59.678 --> 20:01.144
Thanks, Mom.

20:01.179 --> 20:02.979
How's your portfolio coming along?

20:03.014 --> 20:04.213
I turned it in,

20:04.249 --> 20:06.382
so now I just have to wait and see.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.518
I'm sure you'll get in.

20:10.556 --> 20:13.122
Why are you wearing my necklace?

20:42.753 --> 20:44.790
Thank you so much!

20:44.831 --> 20:47.331
My darling grandchildren!

20:47.367 --> 20:51.168
Yes, very sweet, my darling children.

20:51.204 --> 20:52.937
Where's, uh, Poppy and Ximena?

20:52.972 --> 20:56.040
Uh, they went to visit
their parents in detention.

20:56.075 --> 20:57.241
That's gotta be tough.

20:57.277 --> 20:58.517
Yeah, their lawyer's working on

20:58.544 --> 20:59.955
getting them out before their hearing,

20:59.979 --> 21:02.013
so hopefully they'll be home soon.

21:02.048 --> 21:04.681
Well, we are especially
grateful for the invitation.

21:04.717 --> 21:05.849
So, thank you.

21:06.852 --> 21:08.886
Of course. Not a problem.

21:08.921 --> 21:12.756
So, Tess, did you have fun last night?

21:12.792 --> 21:14.991
Uh, yes! I did.

21:15.027 --> 21:17.027
A little too much fun!

21:17.062 --> 21:18.595
- Ow!
- What?

21:18.631 --> 21:20.964
Oh, nothing!

21:20.999 --> 21:22.399
Just, you know, at my age,

21:22.435 --> 21:26.403
every once in a while, you just
get a sharp pain in your shin.

21:28.173 --> 21:30.084
So, I think I know what's
going on with my parents.

21:30.108 --> 21:31.942
Oh, really?

21:31.977 --> 21:34.077
Yeah, I think my dad
is having an affair.

21:34.112 --> 21:35.678
What makes you say that?

21:35.713 --> 21:37.380
He's just been so cagey.

21:37.416 --> 21:38.748
He keeps saying it's mutual,

21:38.783 --> 21:40.650
but I can see how upset my mom is.

21:40.685 --> 21:42.162
And this morning, I
heard her on the phone

21:42.186 --> 21:44.386
talking about some lady named Lara.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.143
What if that's the woman
that he's cheating with?

21:49.828 --> 21:51.594
Hey, uh, can we do presents now?

21:52.697 --> 21:54.129
Uh, sure.

21:54.165 --> 21:57.232
- Grandma, this is from all of us.
- Oh!

21:57.268 --> 21:59.134
Oh, what could it be?

22:03.174 --> 22:07.642
Oh, you... you had
a star named after me?

22:07.678 --> 22:09.345
That is so great!

22:09.380 --> 22:10.679
Thank you!

22:10.714 --> 22:12.281
- Wow!
- That's appropriate.

22:12.316 --> 22:13.715
This is for you two.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.884
- Oh, wow.
- It's Pomegranate Noir.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.886
Mama loves those!

22:17.921 --> 22:19.488
- Oh my gosh!
- Well played!

22:19.523 --> 22:21.400
- Thank you so much!
- She's very excited. You can tell!

22:21.424 --> 22:22.557
This is from me.

22:22.593 --> 22:25.861
Mm! Oh, that's so nice.

22:25.896 --> 22:28.296
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you!

22:29.967 --> 22:32.367
- Oh my God, Callie.
- Callie!

22:32.402 --> 22:34.502
- That's...
- It's so beautiful.

22:34.537 --> 22:37.105
- Callie!
- Beautiful!

22:37.140 --> 22:39.807
- Great shot.
- When'd you take this, sneak-pants?

22:39.842 --> 22:41.075
When you weren't looking.

22:41.111 --> 22:44.379
- Obviously.
- Don't read the card in front of everyone.

22:44.414 --> 22:45.779
And this is from me.

22:45.815 --> 22:48.415
Two stems for my two lovely Mamas.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.218
Oh, thank you! They're so beautiful.

22:51.253 --> 22:54.421
And I got you these.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.189
Oh, thanks!

22:58.260 --> 23:00.093
- Oh!
- With chocolate kisses.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.829
This has gotta be mine, right?

23:01.864 --> 23:03.696
'Cause that one says "Mama."

23:03.732 --> 23:05.143
That's cute.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.134
- Thank you!
- Of course.

23:07.169 --> 23:10.470
Well, I certainly can't top any of that.

23:10.506 --> 23:12.705
But I got you a little something.

23:12.741 --> 23:14.807
- Aw, thanks, Ma.
- Oh.

23:16.711 --> 23:19.679
"Harmony Soul Retreat."

23:19.714 --> 23:22.314
It's a meditation
retreat. Will and I did it.

23:22.350 --> 23:23.816
It's fantastic.

23:23.852 --> 23:27.453
We decreased our emotional
avoidance quotient

23:27.488 --> 23:32.158
from 8.5 to 1.3 in a single weekend.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.993
There's no excuse for not going.

23:34.029 --> 23:37.196
- It's great!
- I can think of a hundred excuses not to go.

23:37.231 --> 23:39.565
- Thank you so much, Sharon.
- Thank you, Mother.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.168
- Thank you.
- So, I kinda screwed up.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.937
Um, I thought that the
brunch was our present.

23:44.972 --> 23:46.383
Oh, is that why you helped out so much?

23:46.407 --> 23:49.408
Yeah, I cut the kiwi!

23:49.444 --> 23:52.611
Anyway, sorry, but I did
finish writing my essay.

23:52.646 --> 23:54.913
And instead of writing about my TBI

23:54.949 --> 23:58.116
as the greatest thing
that impacted my life,

23:58.151 --> 24:00.586
I wrote about my two moms.

24:00.621 --> 24:02.588
So, I'm not gonna read the whole thing.

24:03.624 --> 24:06.257
But I do wanna read the last paragraph.

24:08.729 --> 24:11.963
"So my moms saved me and my sister

24:11.998 --> 24:15.400
from more nights of despair and terror.

24:15.435 --> 24:18.336
They gave us the one
thing that we dreamed of,

24:18.371 --> 24:21.506
but didn't dare actually hope for:

24:21.541 --> 24:23.141
family.

24:23.176 --> 24:24.709
They made us feel safe,

24:24.744 --> 24:27.845
and for the first time
in our young lives, loved.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.347
So loved.

24:31.985 --> 24:35.519
They made us feel like we were
worth something, that we mattered.

24:36.555 --> 24:39.556
That someone in the world wanted us.

24:39.592 --> 24:40.992
And I know that there's nothing

24:41.027 --> 24:43.527
that I could ever give back to them

24:43.562 --> 24:45.695
that could equal what
they've given to me.

24:45.731 --> 24:48.132
But I want my two strong,

24:48.167 --> 24:51.135
beautiful, brilliant moms to know

24:51.170 --> 24:52.536
that they don't have to hope

24:52.571 --> 24:54.671
I'll be the man that
they've raised me to be

24:54.706 --> 24:56.940
because that's the man I want to be.

24:58.210 --> 25:00.777
And I'll always do my best
to never let them down."

25:07.519 --> 25:09.953
Well...

25:09.988 --> 25:12.221
I want you all to know that...

25:12.257 --> 25:14.624
the gift that you give to Mom and me...

25:17.295 --> 25:19.895
... that it isn't the gift of loving us,

25:19.930 --> 25:23.899
it's the gift of the love
that you inspire in us.

25:25.236 --> 25:28.371
And the way that
you've opened our hearts

25:28.406 --> 25:30.739
bigger than we ever thought possible.

25:32.376 --> 25:35.110
And that feeling of
loving someone so much,

25:35.146 --> 25:38.113
loving you guys so much,

25:38.149 --> 25:39.815
we can't ever repay you.

25:40.918 --> 25:42.117
We love you.

25:44.588 --> 25:45.854
Love you, Mama.

25:50.427 --> 25:51.904
Is there more champagne for mimosas?

25:51.928 --> 25:53.995
Hey, you wanna go to the cemetery later?

25:55.232 --> 25:56.831
Yeah.

26:02.606 --> 26:04.105
Hey, I'll be right back, okay?

26:06.976 --> 26:08.509
Where's he going?

26:11.781 --> 26:13.214
Hey, everything all right?

26:13.249 --> 26:15.783
Who the hell do you think you are?

26:15.819 --> 26:19.053
- What do you mean?
- I know Grace made you her proxy.

26:19.089 --> 26:20.487
Whose idea was that? Yours?

26:20.523 --> 26:22.389
- No, of course not.
- No? It wasn't yours?

26:22.425 --> 26:24.525
Is everything all right?

26:26.229 --> 26:27.595
This is Grace's mom.

26:27.630 --> 26:30.231
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:30.266 --> 26:32.499
Is she okay?

26:32.535 --> 26:35.035
Somehow your son convinced my daughter

26:35.070 --> 26:38.271
to put him in charge of all
decisions regarding her health.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.200
- Why would she do this?
- I think she's afraid that...

26:46.944 --> 26:48.911
you won't honor her wishes.

26:50.214 --> 26:53.949
The only person whose choice
it is here is... is Grace.

26:53.985 --> 26:58.099
And... if she trusts
me to do what she wants,

26:58.100 --> 26:59.387
then maybe it's up to her.

26:59.423 --> 27:03.191
Brandon, what you don't
know is that Grace...

27:03.227 --> 27:06.027
didn't want any more chemo
the last time she got sick.

27:06.062 --> 27:07.529
She just wanted to give up.

27:07.564 --> 27:10.698
But she wasn't old enough
to make her own decisions,

27:10.734 --> 27:13.067
so I made her keep fighting.

27:13.103 --> 27:14.568
That bought her six more years,

27:14.604 --> 27:17.071
and because of those six
years, there are new treatments.

27:17.107 --> 27:19.540
Like the gene therapy she just did,

27:19.575 --> 27:21.509
which could very well cure her.

27:23.312 --> 27:26.714
So you see, what Grace wants
may not be what's best for Grace.

27:28.151 --> 27:29.851
Don't kid yourself, honey.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.287
When it comes to whether
my daughter lives or dies,

27:33.322 --> 27:35.789
you are not capable...

27:35.824 --> 27:37.691
of taking on a decision like that.

27:50.039 --> 27:51.437
What was that all about?

27:52.808 --> 27:55.742
Okay, so Logan thinks that
his father is having an affair,

27:55.778 --> 27:58.411
and if no one's gonna
tell him the truth, I will.

27:58.446 --> 28:00.147
So, what is going on in here?

28:00.182 --> 28:02.732
It is very rude to just leave our guests

28:02.733 --> 28:04.133
- out there all alone.
- I cannot...

28:06.454 --> 28:08.555
Sharon. Sharon, wait!

28:14.462 --> 28:15.662
What are you taking?

28:17.732 --> 28:19.232
It's medication.

28:19.267 --> 28:22.467
Yeah, I can see that.
What kinda medication?

28:22.503 --> 28:24.070
It's none of your business, Mother.

28:25.073 --> 28:26.872
Okay.

28:26.908 --> 28:28.074
Don't talk to me.

28:28.109 --> 28:30.109
But don't you dare blame me

28:30.144 --> 28:32.444
for not knowing you were gay.

28:32.479 --> 28:34.213
Okay, because you never talked to me.

28:34.248 --> 28:35.948
You never cared what I thought.

28:35.983 --> 28:38.350
I mean, you know, you wanted
your father's approval.

28:38.385 --> 28:41.152
Oh, yeah, yeah. You always went to him.

28:41.188 --> 28:43.154
You used to just gang
up against me, you know?

28:43.190 --> 28:46.791
Just always the two of you.
You thought I was silly.

28:46.827 --> 28:49.528
What about when you did know I
was gay, Mom, when I told you?

28:50.731 --> 28:51.796
How you disapproved.

28:51.832 --> 28:54.265
- I did not disapprove!
- Yes you did!

28:54.300 --> 28:55.900
You were upset because I was gonna

28:55.936 --> 28:57.401
break up my marriage, and my home,

28:57.437 --> 28:59.548
but, you know, you're fine with
Tess breaking up her marriage.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.517
Cheering her on, taking her
out to gay bars and stuff.

29:01.541 --> 29:03.474
Where was that support for me, huh?

29:03.509 --> 29:05.744
- Your own damn daughter!
- That was different!

29:05.779 --> 29:08.880
Mike was my son-in-law, and
I cared about his feelings.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.616
You think I... I didn't
care about his feelings?

29:11.651 --> 29:13.917
You think it didn't
hurt when I saw him hurt?

29:15.921 --> 29:18.556
You think I wanted Brandon, my son,

29:18.591 --> 29:21.792
to be a kid from a broken family?

29:21.827 --> 29:23.327
To have to be shuttled back and forth

29:23.363 --> 29:24.528
between the two of us?

29:24.564 --> 29:27.430
You think I wanted to
disappoint you and Dad?

29:27.466 --> 29:30.134
I tried so hard, Mom!

29:30.169 --> 29:31.869
I tried!

29:31.904 --> 29:34.604
I tried to be...

29:37.843 --> 29:39.342
To what?

29:41.914 --> 29:44.514
I tried to be straight, Mom.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.550
I tried. I tried to be normal.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.987
I tried to make Daddy proud.

29:51.022 --> 29:53.055
I tried...

29:53.091 --> 29:58.662
to not be ashamed of myself.

30:01.532 --> 30:03.266
Hey.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.234
Hey, what... what's happening?

30:07.272 --> 30:10.106
What's happening? Are you...
are you having a panic attack?

30:10.141 --> 30:13.442
Okay, okay. No, no,
I need you to breathe.

30:13.477 --> 30:14.944
It's a stress response.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.846
Just breathe. Breathe from
your abdomen, not your chest.

30:17.881 --> 30:19.815
- Just shh!
- I need... Please. All right.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.850
Listen to me very carefully.

30:21.885 --> 30:24.186
I need you to touch four things.

30:24.221 --> 30:25.421
Just touch four things.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.789
Touch four things.

30:28.025 --> 30:29.792
- And you...
- Please!

30:29.827 --> 30:32.060
I can't...

30:32.095 --> 30:33.829
Chair! Pillow!

30:33.864 --> 30:35.931
Thank you.

30:35.966 --> 30:38.633
Curtains! The wall!

30:38.668 --> 30:41.336
Okay, now three things that you hear.

30:41.371 --> 30:42.470
Just listen.

30:42.505 --> 30:44.472
Three things you hear.

30:44.507 --> 30:47.242
Listen.

30:47.277 --> 30:49.577
I... I hear your voice.

30:51.614 --> 30:53.013
Hear my breathing.

30:53.049 --> 30:54.782
I...

30:54.818 --> 30:56.384
Good, good.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.853
I hear a really annoying bird.

30:58.888 --> 31:00.955
Good. Okay, two things you smell.

31:02.559 --> 31:04.759
- Your breath.
- Okay, that's uncalled for.

31:04.794 --> 31:06.660
I smell bacon.

31:06.695 --> 31:10.130
- Bacon from brunch.
- Good.

31:10.166 --> 31:11.966
One thing you can taste.

31:13.736 --> 31:15.302
Fear.

31:15.338 --> 31:17.204
- Oh...
- Fear.

31:21.610 --> 31:24.511
Aw, shh shh.

31:24.546 --> 31:25.912
Darling girl.

31:27.282 --> 31:28.715
Sorry.

31:28.751 --> 31:29.961
It's okay. Is everything all right?

31:29.985 --> 31:32.151
Yeah, fine. Listen.

31:32.187 --> 31:34.621
Mariana knows what's going on with you.

31:35.691 --> 31:38.091
She knows you went to a
lesbian bar last night,

31:38.126 --> 31:40.360
and she's kind of put
it together for herself.

31:40.395 --> 31:43.997
So... she says she's gonna
tell Logan if you don't.

31:48.703 --> 31:50.603
You know what?

31:50.638 --> 31:52.038
You're right.

31:53.808 --> 31:55.474
She doesn't know we're here.

31:57.077 --> 31:58.444
Or what day it is.

32:00.448 --> 32:04.283
Cemeteries are like... for the living.

32:07.955 --> 32:11.556
To come and... remember
people they loved.

32:14.895 --> 32:17.729
If we, like, you know, came every day,

32:17.764 --> 32:19.531
that'd be weird.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.235
Like a constant reminder
that they're gone.

32:25.505 --> 32:29.173
It's... kinda like wearing
Mom's necklace every day.

32:36.382 --> 32:37.415
Jude.

32:46.159 --> 32:47.358
Hey, Dad.

32:47.393 --> 32:50.094
Hi. It's good to see you.

32:50.129 --> 32:51.840
It's good to see you, too, Dad.

32:59.364 --> 33:01.264
The reason...

33:01.299 --> 33:04.434
The real reason why I
can't let you be my proxy

33:04.469 --> 33:08.104
isn't because I don't trust
that you're gonna do what I want.

33:09.707 --> 33:11.540
It's because I know if you do,

33:11.575 --> 33:14.110
you'll never forgive yourself.

33:14.145 --> 33:17.312
You won't see it as you
respecting my wishes.

33:17.348 --> 33:20.449
You'll see it as you... giving up on me.

33:20.484 --> 33:24.319
And then you'll always
question whether you should've

33:24.355 --> 33:26.522
made me fight, and...
and you'll blame yourself,

33:26.557 --> 33:29.090
and I... I could never leave
you with that burden, Mom.

33:31.762 --> 33:34.896
Oh, honey. No.

33:44.207 --> 33:47.308
How do you know so much
about panic attacks, Ma?

33:47.343 --> 33:48.743
I used to have 'em.

33:50.413 --> 33:51.880
I didn't know that.

33:51.915 --> 33:53.314
Yeah.

33:53.349 --> 33:54.783
When I was in my early 40s,

33:54.818 --> 33:56.617
around about the age you are now.

34:00.089 --> 34:01.989
Do you think it, uh, it...

34:02.024 --> 34:03.569
it might have something
to do with being in...

34:03.593 --> 34:04.758
in perimenopause?

34:04.794 --> 34:06.327
Oh, I'm sure it does.

34:06.362 --> 34:09.897
Back then, they just
thought you were nuts.

34:09.931 --> 34:12.333
Your dad...

34:12.368 --> 34:13.867
Frank,

34:13.902 --> 34:15.168
thought I could control it

34:15.204 --> 34:18.972
if I would just think happy thoughts.

34:20.409 --> 34:22.309
Exactly.

34:22.344 --> 34:24.476
I mean, but you can't... you can't...

34:24.513 --> 34:26.714
You can't know what that experience is.

34:26.748 --> 34:28.849
You just can't have any idea unless...

34:31.353 --> 34:33.119
unless you know it.

34:34.356 --> 34:35.655
But now you know.

34:35.690 --> 34:38.056
If you ever, you know, need anybody

34:38.092 --> 34:40.226
to talk to who...

34:40.262 --> 34:41.661
understands.

34:44.766 --> 34:47.967
I'm sorry that Dad and I
ganged up on you sometimes.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.668
It's okay.

34:49.704 --> 34:51.804
Ganging up was the way you two bonded.

34:53.241 --> 34:55.274
I knew it.

34:55.309 --> 34:56.876
But...

34:56.911 --> 34:59.478
it didn't feel good
being on the outside.

35:01.082 --> 35:02.514
It still doesn't.

35:04.752 --> 35:07.286
I'll try not to do it anymore, okay?

35:09.857 --> 35:11.290
Thank you for helping me.

35:13.628 --> 35:15.461
I love you, Mom. I hope you know that.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.665
And that is the very, very,

35:19.700 --> 35:22.834
very best Mother's Day gift ever, ever!

35:22.870 --> 35:25.470
Which is a good thing,
because I noticed,

35:25.505 --> 35:27.072
you didn't get me anything.

35:32.479 --> 35:35.346
So, do you come here often?

35:35.382 --> 35:38.249
No, not much.

35:38.285 --> 35:40.084
How 'bout you?

35:40.119 --> 35:41.452
We've only been a few times.

35:42.555 --> 35:44.021
Yeah, it would depend on,

35:44.056 --> 35:46.724
like, whatever foster home we
were in, if they would bring us.

35:49.262 --> 35:51.028
You're still wearing your mom's locket.

35:53.533 --> 35:54.698
What?

35:56.302 --> 35:58.368
Callie had a dream about Mom last night.

35:58.404 --> 36:01.471
She asked her why she
was wearing her necklace.

36:01.507 --> 36:04.008
- Huh.
- I didn't answer, I just,

36:04.043 --> 36:06.177
like, went to feel
for it around my neck,

36:06.212 --> 36:07.577
and it was gone.

36:07.613 --> 36:09.180
Hmm.

36:09.215 --> 36:10.414
What do you think it meant?

36:11.583 --> 36:13.983
I don't really think
dreams mean anything.

36:14.019 --> 36:15.419
No?

36:15.454 --> 36:17.788
Yeah, I didn't used to.

36:17.823 --> 36:19.723
But then, when I was in prison,

36:19.758 --> 36:21.591
I was in this, um...

36:21.627 --> 36:23.993
it was like a therapy, kind of, group,

36:24.029 --> 36:25.729
and we talked about the dreams we had.

36:25.764 --> 36:28.131
I think they're there

36:28.166 --> 36:30.366
to try to help us work through things.

36:30.401 --> 36:32.401
To...

36:32.437 --> 36:34.437
tell ourself stuff.

36:35.974 --> 36:38.007
So, what do you think I
was trying to tell myself?

36:38.043 --> 36:39.642
Well, I'm not sure,

36:39.677 --> 36:41.878
but maybe just the fact
that your mom asked you

36:41.913 --> 36:44.747
why you were wearing it and
then it was gone, that...

36:44.782 --> 36:48.016
it could mean that you want
permission to take it off.

36:49.086 --> 36:50.419
You know?

36:51.556 --> 36:54.189
- Oh, hey!
- Sorry to interrupt.

36:54.225 --> 36:56.592
- It's okay.
- I was just getting worried.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.729
So... Callie and Jude.

37:01.966 --> 37:05.067
Of course. I recognize
you guys from the photos.

37:05.102 --> 37:07.369
You were younger.

37:08.505 --> 37:11.373
It's really, really nice to meet you.

37:12.642 --> 37:14.176
I'm Natalie.

37:14.211 --> 37:15.777
I'm sorry, um...

37:16.813 --> 37:18.212
Yeah, we should go.

37:18.248 --> 37:20.115
- Um...
- Well, I mean,

37:20.116 --> 37:21.193
would you guys like to
come over for dinner?

37:21.217 --> 37:23.685
Sometime at... at my place?

37:23.720 --> 37:25.553
Um...

37:25.589 --> 37:27.522
- Sure.
- Great.

37:28.725 --> 37:30.558
How about next weekend?

37:43.106 --> 37:44.272
Hi!

37:44.307 --> 37:46.140
- Did you forget something?
- No.

37:46.175 --> 37:49.110
No, I was just hoping that
I could speak with you alone.

37:50.212 --> 37:51.645
Oh, okay, sure.

37:55.984 --> 37:58.084
Listen, I'm...

37:58.120 --> 38:00.521
I'm sure you know Logan's very upset

38:00.556 --> 38:02.389
about his father and me.

38:02.425 --> 38:05.392
And we're trying to make this separation

38:05.428 --> 38:07.027
as painless as possible on him,

38:07.062 --> 38:09.062
and if you hurt him

38:09.097 --> 38:12.865
by telling him something
that you know nothing about...

38:12.901 --> 38:16.036
I will make sure that he doesn't
want anything to do with you.

38:24.412 --> 38:26.879
- Hey!
- How you doing?

38:27.882 --> 38:29.248
I'm good.

38:29.283 --> 38:31.884
Well, it seems like it.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.720
- Where's your mom?
- She just left to grab something to eat.

38:36.157 --> 38:39.191
Uh, well, there's something
I... I wanted to tell you,

38:40.261 --> 38:44.096
about, uh, being your proxy person.

38:45.699 --> 38:48.334
I, uh, I thought about it, and...

38:50.004 --> 38:51.570
I'll do it.

38:52.639 --> 38:54.006
If that's what you really want.

39:02.282 --> 39:03.715
Thank you.

39:52.031 --> 39:53.497
Hey, love.

39:57.102 --> 39:59.102
That's very pretty.

39:59.138 --> 40:01.238
Ximena gave it to me.

40:02.974 --> 40:04.741
Jude said that you saw Donald.

40:04.776 --> 40:06.108
Yeah.

40:07.278 --> 40:09.045
He has a girlfriend.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.212
How do you feel about that?

40:10.248 --> 40:12.248
Fine.

40:13.284 --> 40:16.886
I think we've all been sad long enough.

40:19.057 --> 40:20.523
I can remember my mom

40:20.558 --> 40:23.992
without literally wearing
my grief around my neck.

40:33.837 --> 40:36.471
Hey, you guys! You gotta come out here!

40:36.506 --> 40:38.640
We've having a dance party!

40:42.813 --> 40:44.546
Good God, what is happening?

40:44.582 --> 40:46.815
We're having a family dance party!

40:46.850 --> 40:49.918
Come on! This family
needs to have some fun!
