02:21.380 --> 02:23.202
All right. All right.

02:23.302 --> 02:24.724
You guys liked
the last time I showed you

02:24.824 --> 02:26.405
how to make
an off-the-menu sandwich.

02:26.505 --> 02:29.047
So tonight, I'm going
to do it again.

02:29.147 --> 02:32.130
First, you want to start with
your Italian herb cheese bread.

02:32.230 --> 02:34.572
Add your chipotle,
garlic aioli.

02:34.672 --> 02:36.054
If you know, you know.

02:36.154 --> 02:40.057
And what I'm doing now
is tessellating the cheese.

02:40.157 --> 02:42.099
You know, I used
to get asked all the time

02:42.199 --> 02:43.661
what happens after TikTok.

02:43.761 --> 02:45.342
And to be honest, that question
used to freak me out,

02:45.442 --> 02:47.144
especially when
I got out of the Marines.

02:47.244 --> 02:49.266
A year ago,
I was filled with feelings

02:49.366 --> 02:51.387
of lostness and despair.

02:51.487 --> 02:52.909
And if you know,
you know.

02:53.009 --> 02:54.831
But for now,
I'm going to stick

02:54.931 --> 02:56.192
with my sandwich content

02:56.292 --> 02:59.395
because I get to express
my creativity.

02:59.495 --> 03:02.517
And I am so excited about
the different aioli permutations

03:02.617 --> 03:04.519
and the different
possibilities of ham.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.481
And later, I want to do
some good in the world,

03:06.581 --> 03:08.603
like going into,
uh, public service,

03:08.703 --> 03:12.687
and I am also open
to becoming a YouTuber.

03:12.787 --> 03:15.609
Now, guys, you know
I do not do it for the likes,

03:15.709 --> 03:18.732
but I think it would be
really cool

03:18.832 --> 03:22.535
if we can hit 100K
for the boys tonight.

03:24.717 --> 03:25.778
Hey.

03:25.878 --> 03:27.139
Hey.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.901
Hey.
Hey.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.664
So where are we going today?

03:31.764 --> 03:33.765
Ooh, Hawaii.

03:34.966 --> 03:38.870
Took me forever
to find that one.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.872
Have you been?

03:40.972 --> 03:42.633
Oh, yeah. Me and Hawaii.
All the time.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.596
Okay. Well, if I win,
I'll take you.

03:45.696 --> 03:47.277
Well,
you better win soon,

03:47.377 --> 03:48.999
because I think
my professor said

03:49.099 --> 03:50.881
Hawaii is going
to be underwater

03:50.981 --> 03:52.883
in, like, 30 years.

04:06.034 --> 04:08.056
Hey, Sara.

04:08.156 --> 04:10.438
Hey.
Hey, Jed.

04:13.241 --> 04:16.063
So I don't know if you saw,

04:16.163 --> 04:18.786
but, um,
there's going to be

04:18.886 --> 04:20.067
a meteor shower,

04:20.167 --> 04:22.829
and it's supposed to be

04:22.929 --> 04:25.952
really, really beautiful.

04:26.052 --> 04:30.476
I'm going to watch
from Abe's roof. If you...

04:30.576 --> 04:35.120
If both of you
want to come.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.082
Well, you know, we're...
we're on our shift,

04:37.182 --> 04:39.184
so maybe another time.

04:41.826 --> 04:45.730
Well, this only happens
once every 33 years.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.832
But yeah. Okay.

04:55.078 --> 04:56.419
Is he bothering you?

04:56.519 --> 04:58.661
Jed?
Yeah.

04:58.761 --> 05:00.703
You know, I learned
to naturally tune this sense.

05:00.803 --> 05:02.745
Like, I can smell it
when someone's more dangerous

05:02.845 --> 05:03.746
than they look.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.827
Kept me alive out there.

05:04.927 --> 05:06.829
This was in Afghanistan?

05:06.929 --> 05:08.931
San Diego.

06:02.699 --> 06:04.701
Abe cool with you
coming up here?

06:07.543 --> 06:09.665
I... I turn off
the security cameras.

06:11.867 --> 06:13.869
Mind if I, uh...

06:15.510 --> 06:17.632
Uh, go ahead. Thanks.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.319
So, uh, is Sara coming?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.302
No, no.

06:28.402 --> 06:30.664
But, you know,
I've seen you watch her

06:30.764 --> 06:32.766
from up here at night.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.069
I can see everything
from up here.

06:36.169 --> 06:38.170
Like I'm a god.

06:38.651 --> 06:40.473
Do you see that truck?

06:40.573 --> 06:43.716
Why is it parked so far away
from all the others?

06:43.816 --> 06:45.918
Like, not even in range
of the cameras.

06:46.018 --> 06:48.039
I don't know.

06:48.139 --> 06:52.003
Whoever's driving that truck
has something to hide.

06:52.103 --> 06:55.806
You know what you've got?
Perception.

06:55.906 --> 06:57.648
Yeah. I notice
a lot of stuff.

06:57.748 --> 07:01.411
Yeah, man. Perception like that,
in the military, that's gold.

07:01.511 --> 07:02.973
You could be like
a really good sniper--

07:03.073 --> 07:04.734
The military
fucks you up, man.

07:04.834 --> 07:07.577
All that PTSD and shit?

07:07.677 --> 07:10.540
Those guys, they could,
like, snap at any moment.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.882
Dude, you watch
way too many movies.

07:14.323 --> 07:16.325
I don't like movies.

07:18.967 --> 07:22.350
Hey, listen, man.
What, man?

07:22.450 --> 07:23.551
Hey, I'm not trying

07:23.651 --> 07:25.033
to recruit you
or something, okay.

07:25.133 --> 07:28.516
I actually don't think
the military is for you, okay.

07:28.616 --> 07:31.999
But what I'm saying is
is that it showed me

07:32.099 --> 07:34.881
how big the world
actually is.

07:34.981 --> 07:36.163
And I know
you grew up here.

07:36.263 --> 07:38.725
And when the world
seems small,

07:38.825 --> 07:40.827
it's easy to start...

07:41.547 --> 07:43.749
obsessing over things.

07:45.911 --> 07:47.493
What are you talking about?

07:47.593 --> 07:50.475
You've got to leave
Sara alone.

07:57.321 --> 08:00.464
Did she say something?
I... I just think you're...

08:00.564 --> 08:02.566
you know,
creeping her out a bit.

08:04.648 --> 08:05.789
Creeping her out?
Yeah, man.

08:05.889 --> 08:07.511
You got binoculars
and shit, man.

08:07.611 --> 08:09.713
Yeah.

08:09.813 --> 08:11.274
I think if she had
a problem with me,

08:11.374 --> 08:13.376
she would tell me,
you know, not you.

08:15.017 --> 08:16.278
I mean,
who the fuck are you?

08:16.378 --> 08:18.320
I mean, you're, you're what?
You've been here

08:18.420 --> 08:19.922
a month at best.

08:20.022 --> 08:21.643
I'm the one
who welcomed her here

08:21.743 --> 08:22.964
when her family
first came into town,

08:23.064 --> 08:24.286
I was the one, okay.

08:24.386 --> 08:25.687
Chill out, man, I--
Way before

08:25.787 --> 08:27.008
you ever were
even in this town!

08:27.108 --> 08:29.010
I didn't mean it
like that, okay.

08:29.110 --> 08:31.492
You know, maybe you're the one
who's creeping her out.

08:31.592 --> 08:33.013
Do you ever think
about that? With your...

08:33.113 --> 08:34.335
with your sandwiches,

08:34.435 --> 08:36.497
you fucking psycho killer
soldier boy.

08:36.597 --> 08:38.058
I think you need
to calm down, all right?

08:38.158 --> 08:39.219
No, no, no,
you need to calm down!

08:39.319 --> 08:40.500
Hey, I'm just saying,
I get it.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.861
No! Nobody gets it--

08:41.961 --> 08:43.963
Hey, hey...

08:51.450 --> 08:55.794
What you're describing
is monotony.

08:55.894 --> 08:59.597
Okay, when I was
in the Marines,
most days, all I did

08:59.697 --> 09:04.041
was paperwork over and over
and over again, inventory.

09:04.141 --> 09:06.123
And when I would finish,
sometimes they would
just shred it,

09:06.223 --> 09:08.445
and I'd have to do
the whole thing all over again.

09:08.545 --> 09:09.927
Days just blur together.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.649
No one cares what you do
or what you can,

09:12.749 --> 09:14.491
your creativity.

09:14.591 --> 09:16.853
Feels like
there's no way out, right?

09:16.953 --> 09:18.955
Like there's no future.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.011
Sometimes I think
to myself...

09:39.253 --> 09:43.356
whenever I fix up a car,
I think like, what if I just...

09:43.456 --> 09:45.698
climbed in the trunk
and hid.

09:48.861 --> 09:52.505
I'd get a thousand miles away
before anyone noticed.

09:53.946 --> 09:56.268
Hey, you'll make it
out of here someday.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.272
Yeah.

10:00.872 --> 10:02.874
Bullshit.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.742
Times I sit up here,

10:11.842 --> 10:15.105
I think there's a limited amount
of luck in the universe.

10:15.205 --> 10:16.987
They give it out
when you're born

10:17.087 --> 10:20.109
and you either get it
or you don't.

10:20.209 --> 10:21.951
Luck is something
that we created

10:22.051 --> 10:24.714
to make sense of the things
that we can't change.

10:24.814 --> 10:26.996
Right. Mr. Celebrity.

10:27.096 --> 10:29.798
Hey. Hey. I did that.

10:29.898 --> 10:32.641
Okay? That wasn't luck.
I made that happen.

10:32.741 --> 10:34.362
I focused on what
I could control

10:34.462 --> 10:35.603
like making sandwiches

10:35.703 --> 10:37.485
and spreading
positivity globally

10:37.585 --> 10:39.126
through my TikToks.

10:39.226 --> 10:42.650
And the rest of it
is just chaos.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.213
Like this. Right?

10:46.313 --> 10:50.457
If I did this
every single day

10:50.557 --> 10:53.619
and I thought,
"Man, I'm going to win.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.062
I'm going to get out of here
and start a new life,

10:56.162 --> 10:58.264
get that new iPhone 13."

10:58.364 --> 11:00.706
If I did that
every single day,

11:00.806 --> 11:02.267
I would feel
like a loser.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.829
Nah, fuck that, man.

11:04.929 --> 11:07.632
I do it because
it's fun, you know.

11:07.732 --> 11:10.274
It's something I can do.
It... it's a moment.

11:10.374 --> 11:12.877
It makes Sara smile.
It's something to do.

11:12.977 --> 11:15.079
And that makes it
all the more...

11:15.179 --> 11:17.180
Holy shit.

11:18.422 --> 11:19.843
What?

11:19.943 --> 11:21.945
I think I won.

11:22.705 --> 11:24.247
No.

11:24.347 --> 11:26.349
Uh, no, yeah.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.471
How much?

11:29.872 --> 11:31.874
$25,000.

11:33.715 --> 11:36.978
Holy shit, man.
Sara's gonna flip.

11:51.371 --> 11:53.373
All right.

12:36.572 --> 12:38.573
Ahh!

17:16.743 --> 17:19.365
(over phone) 911.
What's your emergency?

17:19.465 --> 17:23.889
I'm calling from 421,
Route 66.

17:23.989 --> 17:27.252
I think I just saw
a murder.

17:52.254 --> 17:54.316
Oh. Oh.
For goddamn...

17:54.416 --> 17:56.418
Ah, shit.

18:09.310 --> 18:11.972
Well, first there was a pop
and then a rattle,

18:12.072 --> 18:15.535
but like a flutter rattle,
an irregular flutter rattle.

18:15.635 --> 18:16.977
And then, I don't know how,

18:17.077 --> 18:19.058
but a steam explosion
was kind of the kicker.

18:19.158 --> 18:20.660
I thought,
that's not right. So...

18:20.760 --> 18:24.503
Without these things turned up,
I can't hear a word.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.306
Uh, it's busted.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.707
Okay, can you fix it?

18:28.807 --> 18:30.188
I can.

18:30.288 --> 18:32.030
Well, with parts and labor
and, you know,

18:32.130 --> 18:34.492
the best fair price
I can offer you is, uh,

18:35.973 --> 18:36.954
$400.

18:37.054 --> 18:38.876
Ah, shit.

18:38.976 --> 18:40.237
Oh, that's a fair price.

18:40.337 --> 18:42.840
No, no, it's...
it's shockingly honest.

18:42.940 --> 18:44.161
Well, it's on the sign.

18:44.261 --> 18:46.483
Yeah, yeah,
it's just, uh...

18:46.583 --> 18:49.926
Shit. All right, so, uh,
how long will that take?

18:50.026 --> 18:51.928
Well, we're closing up
for the night,

18:52.028 --> 18:54.010
so here's what
we're gonna do.

18:54.110 --> 18:56.572
Tomorrow morning,
you come by 8:00 a.m.,

18:56.672 --> 18:58.774
put a bunch of cash
in my hands,

18:58.874 --> 19:01.176
20 minutes later,
I'll have you on the road.

19:01.276 --> 19:03.018
Dude, 20 minutes.
Can't you just, uh...

19:03.118 --> 19:06.621
Well, you know,
it's <i>Top Chef</i> tonight. Sorry.

19:06.721 --> 19:08.783
<i>Top Chef.</i>
Well, God forbid.

19:08.883 --> 19:10.865
Yeah, well, we can
stow your car gratis.

19:10.965 --> 19:14.428
We've got security cameras,
so it'll be safe.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.691
Hell, I'll get my nephew
to move the car. Jed!

19:19.292 --> 19:21.955
Take this car
around the side.

19:22.055 --> 19:24.117
This would be
a nice car...

19:24.217 --> 19:26.218
if you took care of it.

19:31.904 --> 19:36.808
Hey, man, uh, is there a motel
or something around here?

19:36.908 --> 19:40.171
Well, there used to be,
but it burned down.

19:40.271 --> 19:42.573
So, 20 minutes
down the road,

19:42.673 --> 19:44.735
uh, there's a bunch
of motels.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.056
Yeah, you'll be fine.

19:46.156 --> 19:48.739
But your car's
not going anywhere.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.841
So...

19:51.841 --> 19:54.144
Hey, you mind if I try
something a little different

19:54.244 --> 19:55.425
with the cheese-sauce combo?

19:55.525 --> 19:57.427
Just something
I've been working on.

19:57.527 --> 19:58.788
Go nuts.

19:58.888 --> 20:00.890
Thank you.

20:06.174 --> 20:09.878
Hey, uh, do, uh,
do you have a bathroom?

20:09.978 --> 20:12.240
Yeah, but it's
for employees only.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.162
But if you go past the minimart
to the rest stop,

20:15.262 --> 20:17.004
there is
a public bathroom.

20:17.104 --> 20:18.525
It's not too gross.

20:27.353 --> 20:29.095
Mmm.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.656
Meteor shower tonight.
Fuck!

20:30.756 --> 20:32.138
Son of a...

20:32.238 --> 20:34.480
Yeah. Okay. Uh-huh.

20:36.321 --> 20:38.323
Leonids.

20:38.723 --> 20:40.725
Oh.

20:41.446 --> 20:43.448
Okay.

21:18.919 --> 21:20.941
That's what happens in here.

21:21.041 --> 21:23.043
Yeah, it is.

21:26.766 --> 21:28.768
Laundry day.

21:29.089 --> 21:31.090
Bleeding through
your shirt day.

21:32.932 --> 21:34.934
Gunshot wound day.

21:35.454 --> 21:38.477
Mind your own business day.

21:38.577 --> 21:40.579
Please. Thank you.

21:42.461 --> 21:44.803
Just because you're wearing
your underwear inside out

21:44.903 --> 21:47.005
doesn't mean
it's really clean.

21:47.105 --> 21:50.047
That trick
only works once.

21:50.147 --> 21:53.370
'Cause of, there's only
two sides to the underwear.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.472
How many days
you've been on the road?

21:56.113 --> 21:58.115
Uh, two days.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.177
A week.

22:01.277 --> 22:04.741
Yeah. Thank you
for your underwear concern.

22:04.841 --> 22:06.662
Have you lost
a lot of blood?

22:06.762 --> 22:09.064
Well, I got plenty
of blood. Thanks.

22:09.164 --> 22:11.226
If you take ibuprofen
when you're bleeding,

22:11.326 --> 22:12.908
you'll just bleed more.

22:13.008 --> 22:14.990
All right, WebMD.

22:15.090 --> 22:16.311
I'm going to leave now.

22:16.411 --> 22:18.032
Please do not follow me.

22:25.459 --> 22:26.400
Ahh!

22:26.500 --> 22:28.922
The pain is
in your mind.

22:29.022 --> 22:31.044
Lady...

22:31.144 --> 22:33.286
you've got no idea.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.767
Drink.

22:34.867 --> 22:36.409
Yeah.

22:36.509 --> 22:37.770
All right.

22:37.870 --> 22:42.194
Hell, I'm gonna...
accept this situation.

22:43.435 --> 22:44.576
Charlie.

22:44.676 --> 22:46.678
Marge.
Cheers.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.021
Superglue.

22:50.121 --> 22:52.123
Hmm. Yes, it is.

22:54.205 --> 22:56.747
Ah, good thing.

22:56.847 --> 22:59.169
Neat trick, huh?
Neat trick, that.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.152
Dries quick.
You'll be fine.

23:02.252 --> 23:04.594
Right. Okay.

23:04.694 --> 23:06.756
So, uh, I guess
you must get messed with

23:06.856 --> 23:08.678
a lot in this life
on the road.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.681
Nah, I got my dash cam
over there.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.782
And baby Roscoe.

23:14.543 --> 23:16.545
Whoa.

23:17.506 --> 23:19.568
I used to carry Mace.

23:19.668 --> 23:21.409
But you got to get
too close to use it.

23:21.509 --> 23:23.731
Defeats its own purpose. Right.

23:23.831 --> 23:26.534
Plus, one time I accidentally
sprayed Mace in here

23:26.634 --> 23:29.496
when I was practicing
quick draws.

23:29.596 --> 23:31.658
Couldn't stop crying
for about a month.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.900
Second time in my life
I've ever cried.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.784
Oh yeah?
What was the first?

23:37.884 --> 23:40.847
That was back when I was
none of your fucking business.

23:42.928 --> 23:44.750
Keep it.
You might need it.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.792
Oh. Thanks.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.113
Same stuff doctors use,

23:48.213 --> 23:49.995
but big pharmacy
doesn't want you to know.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.097
Right.

23:57.261 --> 24:00.344
You're the first person
I've talked to in 270 days.

24:01.865 --> 24:03.867
Not counting CB radio.

24:05.629 --> 24:06.970
Yeah.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.072
Flattered.

24:09.552 --> 24:13.056
So, uh, you get,
you get bored

24:13.156 --> 24:14.857
out here alone?

24:14.957 --> 24:18.420
I got my books
on tape on CD.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.142
Buddhism for Beginners.

24:20.242 --> 24:21.863
<i>Chapter one.</i>

24:21.963 --> 24:24.986
<i>All existence is suffering,</i>

24:25.086 --> 24:28.049
<i>and the source of suffering
is attachment--</i>

24:29.650 --> 24:31.652
Bambi.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.795
So... not Marge.

24:34.895 --> 24:37.878
First time I cried,
I was watching <i>Bambi.</i>

24:37.978 --> 24:39.980
Oh.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.146
I'm getting not
gonna hook-up vibes.

24:49.228 --> 24:51.130
Yeah, I don't think so.

24:51.230 --> 24:52.771
You want to go
to the Roadhouse, then?

24:52.871 --> 24:54.012
They got three for ten.

24:54.112 --> 24:59.037
Uh, three what?
Oh. Three anything.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.622
There's an extra shirt
if you want it.

25:04.722 --> 25:06.724
Oh, thanks.

25:10.287 --> 25:12.649
Trust me,
I don't exist.

25:13.890 --> 25:16.072
So there's nothing

25:16.172 --> 25:18.995
I could find
about you online.

25:19.095 --> 25:21.437
The cops
couldn't find you.

25:21.537 --> 25:24.720
I don't know,
PI, spooks, nothing.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.923
No phones,
no bank accounts.

25:28.023 --> 25:29.404
Fake IDs
if you can get them,

25:29.504 --> 25:31.326
but better to stick
where people aren't asking.

25:31.426 --> 25:33.407
Never staying in
the same place for too long,

25:33.507 --> 25:35.509
never looking back.

25:37.431 --> 25:38.452
Why?

25:38.552 --> 25:40.294
I got one of those uncles.

25:40.394 --> 25:43.276
Got sent to live with him
when I was 16 maybe.

25:44.998 --> 25:47.180
One day,
I took his money,

25:47.280 --> 25:50.022
pissed on his
favourite chair, and ran.

25:50.122 --> 25:52.745
He used every means
to try to track me down.

25:52.845 --> 25:54.847
Never got his money back.

25:56.808 --> 25:58.830
I love the life, though.

25:58.930 --> 26:01.192
Out here,
Marge is small,

26:01.292 --> 26:04.435
weak, fleshy, a target.

26:04.535 --> 26:06.157
But when I'm driving,

26:06.257 --> 26:09.640
Marge is 80,000 pounds
of pure steel.

26:09.740 --> 26:12.683
Drive, no attachments,
no suffering.

26:12.783 --> 26:14.885
See a hitchhiker
on the road, keep going.

26:14.985 --> 26:16.526
Well, bullshit.

26:18.468 --> 26:20.730
I mean, you stopped
to help me, right?

26:20.830 --> 26:23.532
Hey, listen,
I got the same thing,

26:23.632 --> 26:25.734
can't help it.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.537
Little Miss Galahad
over here.

26:28.637 --> 26:32.581
Okay, Miss, I am going
to get your next round.

26:32.681 --> 26:34.682
Whoa. No.

26:35.643 --> 26:37.705
So when you use
this card,

26:37.805 --> 26:38.866
ping.

26:40.528 --> 26:42.529
All right, uh...

26:43.971 --> 26:44.992
ATMs, too?

26:45.092 --> 26:46.433
I used an ATM once,

26:46.533 --> 26:48.715
my uncle showed up
in four hours.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.597
Any place you land,
first thing.

26:50.697 --> 26:52.118
Four hours.

26:52.218 --> 26:55.281
Find a side hustle
that pays cash.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.483
Gold is the ideal.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.526
But surprisingly, few people
still use it as currency,

27:00.626 --> 27:03.548
and the ones who do
are mainly freaks.

27:04.349 --> 27:05.330
Bitcoin?

27:05.430 --> 27:06.771
Well,
don't get me started.

27:06.871 --> 27:09.173
Ahh.
You want something for that?

27:09.273 --> 27:11.255
You got something?

27:11.355 --> 27:13.577
Side hustle. Cash.

27:13.677 --> 27:16.220
I got a shit ton of
Canadian prescription drugs

27:16.320 --> 27:18.321
in the back of my truck.

27:18.722 --> 27:19.743
Sell 'em along my route.

27:19.843 --> 27:22.625
EpiPens, Viagra,
stuff like that.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.727
Painkillers.

27:25.408 --> 27:26.909
Why didn't you say
something before?

27:27.009 --> 27:28.711
I didn't know
if I could trust you.

27:28.811 --> 27:30.873
Ah, so you trust me now?

27:30.973 --> 27:33.115
Now I'm drunk.

27:33.215 --> 27:35.997
B-R-B.

27:36.097 --> 27:38.139
I guess
I'll B-R-B right here too.

27:45.466 --> 27:47.467
Too easy.

27:48.268 --> 27:49.650
It's for kids.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.751
Yeah, I know.

27:56.195 --> 27:58.277
How about you?
You exist?

28:00.759 --> 28:02.761
Real introvert, huh?

28:07.365 --> 28:08.667
We're closing, okay.

28:08.767 --> 28:10.869
You gotta go home
so I can go home.

28:10.969 --> 28:13.731
The... the sign says
24 hours.

28:15.813 --> 28:17.354
Hey, uh,

28:17.454 --> 28:20.317
do you have, like,
a storeroom or something

28:20.417 --> 28:22.419
I could take a nap in?

28:24.060 --> 28:26.062
No. We don't.

28:40.475 --> 28:42.257
Oh, shit.

28:42.357 --> 28:44.358
Ah.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.541
Ah, buzzard.

28:47.641 --> 28:49.743
Okay. All right.
You know what?

28:49.843 --> 28:52.105
I... I understand
the confusion.

28:52.205 --> 28:54.207
Ah! Not today, buddy.
No, no.

28:55.849 --> 28:59.112
Picnic table's
all yours, buzzard.

28:59.212 --> 29:01.154
Jesus.

29:09.621 --> 29:11.623
Shit.

29:14.465 --> 29:16.688
You're still here.

29:16.788 --> 29:18.169
Cops kept me late
with questions.

29:18.269 --> 29:19.610
Kept everyone.

29:19.710 --> 29:21.852
Asked about you, too.

29:21.952 --> 29:24.414
I told them you split.
Oh, thanks.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.616
Not to help you.

29:25.716 --> 29:28.098
Just because
I thought you split.

29:28.198 --> 29:30.940
So, uh,
what's the business?

29:31.040 --> 29:33.903
Friend from last night,
she killed a guy.

29:34.003 --> 29:36.005
Huh?

29:36.765 --> 29:38.467
What? Marge?

29:38.567 --> 29:40.149
Yeah.

29:40.249 --> 29:41.950
No.
Yep.

29:42.050 --> 29:43.912
Kid who works
the night shift at Subway,

29:44.012 --> 29:46.034
he broke into her truck,
she killed him.

29:46.134 --> 29:48.236
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

29:48.336 --> 29:50.037
I can't believe that.

29:50.137 --> 29:51.399
Wow.

29:51.499 --> 29:54.561
She shot a guy?
I don't know.

29:54.661 --> 29:56.483
Jesus Christ,
she was a weirdo.

29:56.583 --> 29:59.286
She did have
baby Roscoe.

29:59.386 --> 30:02.088
Maybe that makes sense,
I don't know.

30:02.188 --> 30:03.970
The cops say
they got her on tape.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.731
Ah, 'cause of
the dash cam, huh?

30:05.831 --> 30:07.853
No, dash cam
only points ahead.

30:07.953 --> 30:10.115
Bet it was the mechanic shop.
They must have security cameras.

30:11.957 --> 30:15.981
Hey, uh, thanks for,
you know, hiding out with me.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.902
Is that what this was?

30:18.002 --> 30:20.004
Jesus, man.

30:33.736 --> 30:36.879
Four hours. Here we go.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.463
One and one hundred...

30:43.825 --> 30:46.088
Yeah,
there's two hundred.

30:46.188 --> 30:47.609
Well, it's...
it's all there.

30:47.709 --> 30:50.371
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
Three hundred.

30:50.471 --> 30:52.734
It's four $100 bills.

30:52.834 --> 30:54.995
All right.
Yep, there we go.

30:59.279 --> 31:00.741
Hey, uh,

31:00.841 --> 31:03.583
that kid who got killed
last night, did you know him?

31:03.683 --> 31:06.386
Yeah. Damian.

31:06.486 --> 31:08.948
Yeah. He, he hadn't
been here long.

31:09.048 --> 31:10.029
Nice kid.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.591
Fresh out of
the Marine Corps.

31:12.691 --> 31:14.993
Yeah, I just,
I just don't picture him

31:15.093 --> 31:16.555
breaking into trucks.

31:16.655 --> 31:18.657
Maybe he had
money problems.

31:21.860 --> 31:23.321
What do you mean?

31:23.421 --> 31:25.563
I don't know,
I'm guessing.

31:25.663 --> 31:27.665
Played the lottery
every day.

31:28.706 --> 31:30.707
Never won.

31:32.229 --> 31:35.332
Yeah, Jed was the one
who called in the murder.

31:35.432 --> 31:36.933
I told him
to take the day off,

31:37.033 --> 31:39.255
but he insisted
on working.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.837
I guess, to take his mind
off of things, you know.

31:44.039 --> 31:46.041
Huh.

31:56.210 --> 31:57.752
Hmm.

31:57.852 --> 31:59.854
Not as good.

32:00.254 --> 32:02.256
Nothin' ever is.

32:06.860 --> 32:09.002
Hey, sweet pea!

32:11.824 --> 32:13.826
All right. Thank you.

32:17.630 --> 32:20.732
I... I'd like to buy
a scratch-off, please.

32:20.832 --> 32:22.774
Which one?

32:22.874 --> 32:25.717
Hmm.
The... the Gold Rush.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.642
In... in Damian's honor.

32:51.140 --> 32:54.382
Oh, my fucking God.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.966
What happened?

33:04.111 --> 33:07.334
I'm out of here, fuckers!

33:07.434 --> 33:09.496
Creepo flipping out.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.057
Fine.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.219
<i>...a long-haul truck driver</i>

33:13.319 --> 33:14.901
<i>was arrested
earlier this morning</i>

33:15.001 --> 33:17.543
<i>after a young man
was found bludgeoned to death</i>

33:17.643 --> 33:20.626
<i>in a rest area off Route 66
near Albuquerque.</i>

33:20.726 --> 33:22.147
Bludgeoned?

33:22.247 --> 33:23.549
<i>Police have yet to release
any further details.</i>

33:23.649 --> 33:24.670
Bludgeoned?

33:54.957 --> 33:57.459
Oh. I thought
you were leaving?

33:57.559 --> 33:58.820
Yeah, I am.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.703
Uh, hey, I know
this is inappropriate

34:01.803 --> 34:03.424
and kind of,
I don't know, insensitive,

34:03.524 --> 34:05.987
but is there any way
I could take a look

34:06.087 --> 34:08.429
at the security camera footage
from last night?

34:08.529 --> 34:10.270
Sure. Yeah.
If you could squeeze in.

34:10.370 --> 34:12.372
Squeeze in.

34:15.575 --> 34:18.398
Oh shit.
She totally did it.

34:18.498 --> 34:19.799
Goddamn!

34:19.899 --> 34:21.921
Look at that. Sinewy.

34:22.021 --> 34:23.963
Like an ant. Goddamn.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.284
Marge was moving drugs.

34:25.384 --> 34:27.166
That's why she did it.
What?

34:27.266 --> 34:28.967
Whether she did
or didn't do it,

34:29.067 --> 34:32.370
let's all agree she had
the right to do it.

34:32.470 --> 34:33.812
What do you mean,
whether or not she did it?

34:33.912 --> 34:35.373
I... I thought
you had it on tape.

34:35.473 --> 34:36.974
I... Where's the bludgeoning?

34:37.074 --> 34:38.776
No, look, at that angle
right there.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.498
All you can see
is her dumping the body.

34:40.598 --> 34:43.180
Aah. Ooh. Ooh.
There she goes.
Oh, my God.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.823
Play it again.

34:46.923 --> 34:48.865
Ooh! God.

35:12.626 --> 35:14.888
Aw, shit...

35:14.988 --> 35:17.371
You have to buy something
if you want to use the bathroom.

35:17.471 --> 35:19.292
Yeah.

35:19.392 --> 35:21.614
You know,
what I'd really like is, uh,

35:21.714 --> 35:23.536
to take a look
at your security footage.

35:23.636 --> 35:25.338
Why? Are you a cop?

35:25.438 --> 35:27.139
Hmm, yeah.

35:27.239 --> 35:30.863
I'm a very deep,
deep undercover cop.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.024
I don't like cops.

35:32.124 --> 35:33.425
Neither do I. Right?

35:33.525 --> 35:35.667
So I...
I'm not a cop.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.769
Then why should I
show you my footage?

35:38.369 --> 35:39.390
Paradoxical.

35:41.252 --> 35:43.194
You know, I, uh,

35:43.294 --> 35:45.716
always been curious
about these.

35:45.816 --> 35:47.818
I bet they taste
like the future.

35:57.627 --> 35:59.088
Jesus.

35:59.188 --> 36:00.930
What is that?

36:01.030 --> 36:02.451
Cotton candy.

36:05.954 --> 36:08.897
Uh, you want one?

36:08.997 --> 36:11.679
No, thanks. Those things
are like really bad for you.

36:13.841 --> 36:15.302
<i>And later, I want to do
some good in the world,</i>

36:15.402 --> 36:17.064
<i>like, um, public service,</i>

36:17.164 --> 36:20.087
<i>and I'm also open
to becoming a YouTuber.</i>

36:22.209 --> 36:24.230
Were you guys close?

36:24.330 --> 36:25.472
Yeah.

36:25.572 --> 36:28.354
They're saying
he broke into a truck.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.956
Why? He wouldn't do that.

36:30.056 --> 36:32.338
Yeah, he does not seem
like the type.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.922
If only we had, uh,

36:37.022 --> 36:39.024
some way to prove it.

36:47.992 --> 36:49.453
Ehh. That's it?

36:49.553 --> 36:51.855
Shit, I was hoping it would
show more of the street.

36:51.955 --> 36:54.538
So, Damian, did you see him
last night?

36:54.638 --> 36:55.979
Every night.

36:56.079 --> 36:58.421
He'd come in around 10:00,
bring me a sandwich,

36:58.521 --> 37:00.523
and then he'd buy
a lottery ticket.

37:01.444 --> 37:04.066
Yeah.
Had this dumb little routine

37:04.166 --> 37:06.268
where he'd pick a state quarter
from my collection

37:06.368 --> 37:07.749
and use it
to scratch it off.

37:07.849 --> 37:10.232
Last night,
he did Hawaii again.

37:10.332 --> 37:12.874
Oof. Ugh.
Yeah, I hate sand.

37:12.974 --> 37:15.837
Swimming,
it's not for me.

37:15.937 --> 37:18.699
I... I heard that he played
every day and never won.

37:19.940 --> 37:21.942
That's true.

37:23.864 --> 37:25.565
That's weird.

37:25.665 --> 37:28.328
What?
Okay, so, uh...

37:28.428 --> 37:29.609
I have this thing.

37:29.709 --> 37:31.251
I can tell
if someone's lying.

37:31.351 --> 37:32.892
I mean, it's a...
it's a whole thing.

37:32.992 --> 37:34.173
It would take too long
to explain.

37:34.273 --> 37:36.175
It's fine. I don't care.

37:36.275 --> 37:39.818
Great. So, you know,
the kid who works
over Abe's place?

37:39.918 --> 37:41.340
Jed.
Yes, Jed.

37:41.440 --> 37:44.823
So Jed told me
that Damian never won,

37:44.923 --> 37:47.625
but he was lying,
I could tell.

37:47.725 --> 37:50.348
However, just now,
when you said it,

37:50.448 --> 37:52.449
you were telling the truth.

37:53.130 --> 37:54.311
I don't get it.

37:54.411 --> 37:56.954
Yeah, me neither.
I mean, it's, uh...

37:57.054 --> 37:59.876
it's kind of breaking
my brain a little bit.

37:59.976 --> 38:02.939
Jed won the lottery
this morning.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.241
He what?

38:05.341 --> 38:08.364
Twenty-five grand
on a scratcher.

38:08.464 --> 38:10.406
The universe
makes no sense.

38:10.506 --> 38:12.087
That is a hat on a hat.

38:12.187 --> 38:14.569
Uh, I can't even
process that right now.

38:14.669 --> 38:16.131
So you and Damian,

38:16.231 --> 38:18.893
you... you did your whole
routine last night?

38:18.993 --> 38:20.935
Yeah. Everything felt normal.

38:21.035 --> 38:23.617
Well, Jed came in and asked
if we wanted to watch

38:23.717 --> 38:25.059
the meteor shower
from his roof.

38:25.159 --> 38:27.341
He does stuff
like that a lot.

38:27.441 --> 38:28.822
And, uh, you didn't go?

38:28.922 --> 38:30.944
No, neither of us did.

38:31.044 --> 38:33.766
We hung out, and then
he went back to his shift
at the Subway.

38:39.091 --> 38:41.974
I can't even process.
That's a cat toy.

38:43.695 --> 38:44.716
Yeah.

38:44.816 --> 38:46.438
No, it's not.

38:46.538 --> 38:48.520
Yeah, it is.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.321
Holy shit.

38:50.421 --> 38:52.884
Yes, you're right.
Not a camera at all.

38:52.984 --> 38:54.685
That's just a cat toy.

38:54.785 --> 38:57.368
Why is it a cat toy?

38:57.468 --> 38:58.609
Why is anything anything?

38:58.709 --> 39:02.252
Dude.
To deter.
It's a deterrent.

39:02.352 --> 39:04.374
Deterrent? Cat toy.

39:04.474 --> 39:06.095
Okay, I'm going
to move off this topic.

39:06.195 --> 39:08.017
So what about,
uh, time cards?

39:08.117 --> 39:10.980
Do you guys punch in and out
or something?

39:11.080 --> 39:12.942
Like at an
old-timey factory?

39:13.042 --> 39:14.503
QR code, something,

39:14.603 --> 39:16.144
whatever the kids
use these days

39:16.244 --> 39:17.826
for time cards,
I don't know, man.

39:17.926 --> 39:19.507
I pretty much
just show up whenever.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.850
You're a real black hole
of information.

39:26.013 --> 39:28.015
Yo!

39:28.375 --> 39:30.317
Employees only.

39:30.417 --> 39:35.442
Come on. That's like
Subway sanctum sanctorum.

39:35.542 --> 39:37.283
Do you think
this could be blood?

39:37.383 --> 39:38.605
That's light mayonnaise.

39:38.705 --> 39:40.706
How do you know it's light?

39:41.827 --> 39:43.829
I just know.

39:45.471 --> 39:47.012
Lucky bastard.

39:47.112 --> 39:49.394
How would you like to help
an old lady retire early?

39:52.277 --> 39:54.139
Taking a break?

39:54.239 --> 39:55.740
I don't work anymore.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.662
Ah, smart.

39:57.762 --> 40:00.504
Oof. Nasty cut.

40:00.604 --> 40:02.426
How'd you get that?

40:02.526 --> 40:04.308
Uh, sharp piece of metal.

40:04.408 --> 40:07.110
I always get injured
on this job.

40:07.210 --> 40:09.032
Well, it must be
your lucky day, kid,

40:09.132 --> 40:12.195
'cause Doctor Superglue
has arrived.

40:21.023 --> 40:23.245
It feels better, right?
Mm-hmm.

40:23.345 --> 40:25.767
Hey, uh,
you catch that, uh,

40:25.867 --> 40:27.769
crazy rat-a-taz last night,

40:27.869 --> 40:29.570
the, uh, the Leonids?

40:29.670 --> 40:31.772
Yeah, I had a few beers
and watched it from the roof.

40:31.872 --> 40:34.635
Oh yeah? Alone?
I'm always alone.

40:35.636 --> 40:37.978
I'm an alone wolf.

40:38.078 --> 40:40.100
What about the, uh,
the other kids?

40:40.200 --> 40:43.783
Uh, Sandwich guy and goth girl.
They didn't want to come?

40:43.883 --> 40:46.225
Why would those guys
want to hang out with me?

40:46.325 --> 40:48.327
Well, why wouldn't they?

40:49.208 --> 40:51.550
You just won the lotto.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.231
You're going places.

40:53.331 --> 40:55.634
You figure out how you're
gonna spend the money yet?

40:55.734 --> 40:58.136
Uh, no. No, I don't.
I don't know.

41:00.378 --> 41:03.260
No one's ever asked me
what I want to do before.

41:04.742 --> 41:07.945
Yeah, well, ta-da,
I'm asking.

41:09.066 --> 41:10.127
Well, it's too late.

41:10.227 --> 41:11.608
I've already missed out
on too much,

41:11.708 --> 41:13.490
and so I'm not going
to reach my full potential,

41:13.590 --> 41:15.091
which was really high.

41:15.191 --> 41:17.493
You seem smart.

41:17.593 --> 41:19.895
I am smart. Okay.

41:19.995 --> 41:23.018
So you're smart, you're young,
you have money,

41:23.118 --> 41:26.581
you're right,
No options at all.

41:26.681 --> 41:28.383
I think I'm gonna
go to Hawaii.

41:28.483 --> 41:30.865
Oh. Ew.

41:30.965 --> 41:32.266
Guh. Shit.

41:32.366 --> 41:36.270
My bad.
Let me get that off.

41:36.370 --> 41:38.992
Hey, that's a pretty
neat trick, right?

41:39.092 --> 41:40.874
The, uh, the superglue?

41:40.974 --> 41:42.355
Yeah, it's a funny thing.

41:42.455 --> 41:43.957
The, uh, the lady
that they're saying

41:44.057 --> 41:45.839
killed Sandwich
taught it to me.

41:45.939 --> 41:47.640
Marge.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.202
She probably saved
my life, actually and...

41:50.302 --> 41:52.404
Well, now she's locked up
for killing that kid.

41:52.504 --> 41:55.167
Whoa, dude.
Do you want a beer?

41:55.267 --> 41:57.449
I'm going
to have a beer.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.090
Okay. Thanks.

41:59.190 --> 42:01.653
So, you said Damian

42:01.753 --> 42:04.455
wasn't on the roof
last night, right?

42:04.555 --> 42:06.557
I already told you.

42:07.958 --> 42:09.960
I don't think you did.

42:13.043 --> 42:16.486
I was alone
on the roof all night.

42:20.730 --> 42:22.732
Huh.

42:24.773 --> 42:26.895
Look at the time.

43:02.607 --> 43:05.150
Weren't you in a hurry?
Oh. Yeah.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.593
I guess I am on a bit
of a borrowed time.

43:08.693 --> 43:13.477
Say, so my bag went missing
from my car last night.

43:13.577 --> 43:16.400
Is that the security camera
that you mentioned?

43:16.500 --> 43:18.501
Yeah. Yeah.

43:25.988 --> 43:28.030
Uh! Wait.

43:30.672 --> 43:32.674
Yeah. Okay.

43:33.755 --> 43:36.458
It changes. Here, look.

43:36.558 --> 43:39.300
Frame forwards,
Frame backwards.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.582
Frame forwards,
Frame backwards.

43:41.682 --> 43:42.743
Do you see there?

43:42.843 --> 43:44.265
Why would the
camera angle change?

43:44.365 --> 43:46.467
And... and...
and the tarp.

43:46.567 --> 43:49.429
Why would the tarp move?

43:49.529 --> 43:51.952
Yeah.
Big number's changed, too.

43:52.052 --> 43:53.233
Yeah, you're right.

43:53.333 --> 43:55.915
Yeah.
It goes from 10:30...

43:56.015 --> 43:58.437
to 11:30.

43:58.537 --> 44:00.519
We're missing a chunk
of the footage.

44:00.619 --> 44:02.241
Well, that happens
all the time.

44:02.341 --> 44:04.483
Yeah, Jed
explained it to me.

44:04.583 --> 44:07.465
It seems that the wind
gets caught up in the circuit.

44:24.521 --> 44:26.522
I wanted to come
check on you.

44:27.643 --> 44:29.645
See if you're
feeling better.

44:31.207 --> 44:33.208
I'm in complete mourning.

44:34.169 --> 44:36.712
Just the total absurdity
of dying like this

44:36.812 --> 44:39.434
after surviving,
like, the war.

44:39.534 --> 44:41.536
I think he mostly
did paperwork.

44:44.378 --> 44:47.722
His shift starts
in a few hours.

44:47.822 --> 44:49.123
I can't believe
he's not going to be there.

44:49.223 --> 44:50.264
Wait, you know that
those guys aren't actually,

44:50.264 --> 44:51.645
like, heroes, right?

44:51.745 --> 44:53.086
Like, have you ever heard
of, like, Abu Ghraib?

44:53.186 --> 44:56.109
Can you have, like,
any respect for the dead?

45:05.277 --> 45:07.279
You know,
I was just thinking of...

45:08.240 --> 45:10.242
gettin' out of here soon.

45:12.203 --> 45:14.245
I was thinking
of going to Hawaii.

45:19.530 --> 45:21.532
You want to come with?

45:24.574 --> 45:26.576
Why would you say that?

45:27.937 --> 45:29.599
I'm not going
to Hawaii with you.

45:29.699 --> 45:32.542
Are you serious?
That's so weird.

46:25.749 --> 46:27.751
What are you
doing up here?

46:29.713 --> 46:31.655
It's a beautiful view.

46:31.755 --> 46:33.756
All the, uh...

46:34.797 --> 46:36.739
All of it.

46:36.839 --> 46:38.841
Yeah.

46:40.402 --> 46:42.404
Do you want to sit?

46:43.005 --> 46:45.006
I'm okay.

46:47.769 --> 46:50.231
Those belong to Sandwich?

46:50.331 --> 46:53.474
What? No. Why...
why would you say that?

46:53.574 --> 46:57.638
Uh, I don't know, Jed,
I, uh...

46:57.738 --> 47:01.922
I found one of these bottle caps
in his apron pocket,

47:02.022 --> 47:04.564
and I thought maybe
you might have lied to me

47:04.664 --> 47:06.826
and he was up here with you
last night, after all.

47:08.668 --> 47:11.891
Well, one,
what do you fuckin' care?

47:11.991 --> 47:14.813
And two,
people drink beer.

47:14.913 --> 47:16.575
Well, for one,
a friend of mine

47:16.675 --> 47:18.657
is in jail right now
for Damian's murder.

47:18.757 --> 47:20.378
But then there's a lot
of weird bullshit

47:20.478 --> 47:21.739
going on around here,

47:21.839 --> 47:23.981
all of which is leading me
to fucking care

47:24.081 --> 47:26.063
what happened
on this roof last night.

47:26.163 --> 47:29.306
And for two, Sara told me
that Damian told her

47:29.406 --> 47:31.408
that he was coming up
to see you.

47:34.491 --> 47:36.493
Bullshit.

47:38.775 --> 47:40.776
Sure you don't
want to sit?

47:46.341 --> 47:48.123
Yeah. He was up here last night.
I was embarrassed.

47:48.223 --> 47:50.125
I didn't want
to mention it.

47:50.225 --> 47:51.806
Embarrassed.

47:51.906 --> 47:52.927
Yeah, 'cause

47:53.027 --> 47:55.490
he asked me
to leave Sara alone.

47:55.590 --> 47:57.091
Like, I'm creeping on her,

47:57.191 --> 47:58.893
and he's some
white knight hero.

47:58.993 --> 48:00.995
It was fucking humiliating.

48:02.156 --> 48:04.378
Yeah, and that, uh,

48:04.478 --> 48:08.221
must have
made you angry, huh?

48:08.321 --> 48:10.263
You got a thing for Sara?

48:10.363 --> 48:12.625
A thing?

48:12.725 --> 48:15.227
For little daddy's girl,
gets everything she wants.

48:15.327 --> 48:17.790
Princess in her castle.

48:17.890 --> 48:20.912
I couldn't shake
the dust off fast enough.

48:21.012 --> 48:23.154
She's gonna be
sitting over there,
still selling Twinkies

48:23.254 --> 48:25.517
and blowing truckers
when I'm long gone,

48:25.617 --> 48:27.078
'cause I actually
took control of my life

48:27.178 --> 48:30.021
and fuck you to this place,
I made it happen.

48:31.622 --> 48:33.624
Made it.

48:35.025 --> 48:36.406
I mean, I...

48:36.506 --> 48:38.929
You didn't make shit. Right?

48:39.029 --> 48:41.211
You won the lottery.
That's dumb luck.

48:41.311 --> 48:42.772
Hey, look at Damian.

48:42.872 --> 48:45.995
He played every day,
and he never won. Right?

48:47.676 --> 48:49.678
Yup.

48:50.319 --> 48:52.321
Bullshit.

49:25.430 --> 49:27.732
Hey, can, can I get
one of the, uh,
the scratchers?

49:27.832 --> 49:29.954
Uh, whichever one
Sandwich played.

49:41.364 --> 49:43.366
Hmm.

49:43.887 --> 49:46.789
You know what,
uh, let me get a few more.

49:46.889 --> 49:49.192
That's a fool's path
to riches.

49:49.292 --> 49:51.854
Amen, brother. Amen.

50:40.457 --> 50:42.459
What do you want?

50:42.940 --> 50:44.941
I think I've
kind of been a dick.

50:47.344 --> 50:49.085
Uh, no.

50:49.185 --> 50:52.889
Yeah. I just think, like,
I haven't gotten any sleep.

50:52.989 --> 50:56.332
I'm having a hard time
emotionally regulating.

50:56.432 --> 50:58.854
Probably a combination
of Damian's senseless death

50:58.954 --> 51:01.136
and I started
this new birth control,

51:01.236 --> 51:04.019
and that's making me
really hormonal.

51:04.119 --> 51:06.120
I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

51:07.321 --> 51:08.943
Nah, it's cool.

51:09.043 --> 51:11.045
I actually figured
you were hormonal.

51:11.886 --> 51:13.887
I forgive you.

51:14.568 --> 51:17.310
Cool. Yeah. Great.

51:17.410 --> 51:19.793
Hey, unrelated,
can I see your scratch-off?

51:19.893 --> 51:22.275
I've never seen anyone win,
like, more than $5.

51:22.375 --> 51:24.617
It'd be cool to see
an actual winning ticket.

51:25.938 --> 51:27.940
Oh, yeah.

51:29.501 --> 51:31.503
Okay, thanks.

51:32.064 --> 51:34.065
Hey, wait, what the fuck?

51:35.787 --> 51:37.789
Hey, give that back.

51:39.030 --> 51:40.531
Weird.

51:40.631 --> 51:42.013
What's weird?

51:42.113 --> 51:43.654
Oh, uh, you know,

51:43.754 --> 51:46.697
I... I just bought
a few scratchers myself.

51:46.797 --> 51:47.938
I didn't win anything. No.

51:48.038 --> 51:49.619
It's a fool's path
to riches.

51:49.719 --> 51:51.741
But I did notice,

51:51.841 --> 51:54.304
every ticket has a...
a serial number.

51:54.404 --> 51:56.866
It's printed right there
on the... on the side

51:56.966 --> 51:59.428
and, well, the serial numbers
are apt to be...

51:59.528 --> 52:01.310
they're sequential.

52:01.410 --> 52:02.631
That means in order.

52:02.731 --> 52:04.433
I know. So?

52:04.533 --> 52:07.155
So then I remembered
that I saw this trucker

52:07.255 --> 52:09.517
playing one of those kinds
of scratch-offs this morning.

52:09.617 --> 52:11.159
It was a Gold Rush.

52:11.259 --> 52:12.840
It was right before
I picked up my car,

52:12.940 --> 52:16.804
which is right before
you bought your ticket.

52:16.904 --> 52:18.886
This trucker,
he didn't win anything...

52:18.986 --> 52:22.089
and he threw it away.

52:22.189 --> 52:24.851
Ew.
I know, but...

52:24.951 --> 52:27.694
seven-four-three,
six-three...

52:27.794 --> 52:29.795
four-fifty-four.

52:30.956 --> 52:33.379
Uh, the number
on this ticket,

52:33.479 --> 52:37.022
it ends in 454.

52:37.122 --> 52:39.824
So that means
if you, uh,

52:39.924 --> 52:42.146
really bought your ticket

52:42.246 --> 52:43.988
after this guy,

52:44.088 --> 52:47.511
well, then your number,
it would end with, uh,

52:47.611 --> 52:51.395
455 or maybe...

52:51.495 --> 52:55.058
56, yeah, you know,
even 57.

52:56.259 --> 52:58.261
But it doesn't, right?

52:59.582 --> 53:03.025
No. Your ticket number
is 450.

53:07.749 --> 53:11.132
M-maybe there's a misprint.

53:11.232 --> 53:12.654
Or maybe,

53:12.754 --> 53:17.058
maybe you didn't buy
that ticket at all.

53:17.158 --> 53:22.022
Maybe, maybe Damian bought
that ticket last night,

53:22.122 --> 53:24.264
like he did every night.

53:24.364 --> 53:27.807
And maybe he brought it
up to the roof.

53:28.928 --> 53:31.751
Yeah. And... and maybe

53:31.851 --> 53:35.354
when it was just the two of you
alone out there,

53:35.454 --> 53:38.097
well, he realised he'd won.

53:39.418 --> 53:41.360
And maybe...

53:41.460 --> 53:43.461
you killed him for it.

53:44.662 --> 53:46.084
I didn't do it.

53:46.184 --> 53:48.446
I know you did,
you motherfucker.

53:48.546 --> 53:49.887
Hey.

53:49.987 --> 53:51.969
Everything all right
in here?

53:52.069 --> 53:53.490
Oh, yeah.
We're just...

53:53.590 --> 53:55.212
Yeah, sorry,
I had these turned up

53:55.312 --> 53:57.494
a little bit too high.

53:57.594 --> 53:59.376
Yeah. You okay?
You good?

53:59.476 --> 54:01.458
Yeah. She's just
gettin' out of here.

54:01.558 --> 54:03.780
All right, I'll go
warm up the car.

54:03.880 --> 54:05.261
Yeah.

54:05.361 --> 54:07.363
Cool.

54:09.845 --> 54:11.847
Well, you got me.

54:13.528 --> 54:15.710
I did it.

54:15.810 --> 54:17.812
So why don't we
call the cops?

54:18.733 --> 54:21.475
I'm sure they'd love
to hear some

54:21.575 --> 54:23.918
half-baked theory
about serial numbers

54:24.018 --> 54:28.322
from a vagrant who...
lives in her car.

54:28.422 --> 54:30.644
It's not just a theory.

54:30.744 --> 54:32.745
You admitted it.

54:33.226 --> 54:35.008
To you.

54:35.108 --> 54:38.991
You're not a cop.
You're just some woman.

54:40.552 --> 54:42.054
Got no proof.

54:42.154 --> 54:44.596
I'm not on camera,
like your friend.

54:46.117 --> 54:48.119
If I'm wrong...

54:48.920 --> 54:51.622
let's give 'em a call.

54:51.722 --> 54:54.625
We can tell 'em, "Hey,
it's Jed from the rest stop

54:54.725 --> 54:58.188
"at 421,
Route 66, and..."

54:58.288 --> 54:59.670
Sorry,
what's your name?

54:59.770 --> 55:01.471
Charlie Cale.

55:01.571 --> 55:03.313
Your registration's
in the glove box.

55:03.413 --> 55:05.235
Did you know that you're
a person of interest

55:05.335 --> 55:07.957
in a bunch of deaths
in Nevada?

55:08.057 --> 55:11.140
I'm sure the cops
would love to talk to you.

55:12.901 --> 55:15.023
What's that?

55:19.347 --> 55:20.849
Nothing.

55:20.949 --> 55:22.950
If I were you...

55:23.511 --> 55:25.573
I'd get in
my trash bucket,

55:25.673 --> 55:28.455
and I'd speed
the fuck out of here

55:28.555 --> 55:31.798
before I call
the cops on you.

55:35.802 --> 55:37.804
All set.
Ready to go.

55:43.609 --> 55:45.611
Have a safe trip.

55:49.654 --> 55:51.436
Drive safe.

55:51.536 --> 55:53.538
Thanks.

56:00.144 --> 56:03.086
Fucking Christ, Marge.
Ah, man, I'm sorry.

56:03.186 --> 56:05.008
<i>Don't miss our hilarious new</i>

56:05.108 --> 56:07.490
<i>hidden camera show</i>
Prank Yankers.

56:07.590 --> 56:09.452
<i>You won't believe
what people do</i>

56:09.552 --> 56:11.534
<i>when they don't know
they're being filmed.</i>

56:11.634 --> 56:14.116
<i>Thursdays at 12:00.
Don't miss it.</i>

56:31.732 --> 56:33.314
Hey. Uh, hi. Hey.

56:33.414 --> 56:35.115
So...
I'm trying to sleep, lady.

56:35.215 --> 56:37.077
Oh, of course--
I take six small naps a day.

56:37.177 --> 56:38.278
I got a method.
Yes, yes.

56:38.378 --> 56:40.560
So that's your
dash cam, right?

56:40.660 --> 56:42.081
Yeah.
Okay, good.

56:42.181 --> 56:43.803
And, you see, it's pointed
right at the rest stop.

56:43.903 --> 56:45.044
It's pointed right
at where Marge...

56:45.144 --> 56:46.325
You don't know
any of this, okay.

56:46.425 --> 56:48.527
So it's recording
all the time?

56:48.627 --> 56:50.569
Wouldn't be much good
if it didn't.

56:50.669 --> 56:52.251
Right.
And your, uh, radio,

56:52.351 --> 56:53.852
so you can just contact
any trucker

56:53.952 --> 56:55.413
on the road with it, right?

56:55.513 --> 56:57.095
Yeah, if you got
their call sign.

56:57.195 --> 56:58.416
Uh-huh, cool.
So, okay,

56:58.516 --> 57:00.578
just two, uh, no,
three more questions.

57:00.678 --> 57:03.020
Wait. Hello.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.302
Hi. Uh, I'm looking
for a trucker

57:05.402 --> 57:06.503
that was here last night.

57:06.603 --> 57:08.185
He was eating
a burger at the bar.

57:08.285 --> 57:10.187
That narrows it down
to about ten people.

57:10.287 --> 57:12.749
Okay, He was in...
he was wearing a flannel.

57:12.849 --> 57:14.851
He had his, uh,
his hat pulled down low.

57:19.215 --> 57:20.636
Dammit. Uh...

57:20.736 --> 57:22.638
Okay, look,
he had his...

57:22.738 --> 57:23.959
his truck parked
right outside that window.

57:24.059 --> 57:25.480
It had an animal logo on it,

57:25.580 --> 57:28.043
like a cat-like
badger-mouse-type animal,

57:28.143 --> 57:29.484
some animal
with legs and fur

57:29.584 --> 57:31.986
and fucking fuck-like thing,
what was it?

57:35.229 --> 57:36.610
Is that a squirrel?

57:36.710 --> 57:38.132
Nah, some kind of dog.

57:38.232 --> 57:39.893
No, not a squirrel.
Not a dog.

57:39.993 --> 57:41.415
Uh, which one
eats wood?

57:41.515 --> 57:43.216
Dumbass, none of them
eat wood.

57:43.316 --> 57:45.178
Guinea pig. Guinea pig.
Man 2: Capybara.

57:45.278 --> 57:47.260
Ah, geez.
Fucking useless.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.741
Opossum.
Oh, that's--

57:51.524 --> 57:52.665
Yeah, look,
take a look--

57:52.765 --> 57:54.106
Quiet, quiet,
quiet please,

57:54.206 --> 57:56.808
I... I need
to think. Okay.

57:58.089 --> 58:00.091
Geez.

58:11.902 --> 58:14.965
That's it. That's all
that's been on my mind all day.

58:15.065 --> 58:16.686
That is the key.

58:16.786 --> 58:19.248
Does anybody know this song?

58:26.635 --> 58:28.537
Okay!

58:28.637 --> 58:31.539
<i>♪ You say you got
a pretty face ♪</i>

58:31.639 --> 58:34.102
<i>♪ But the rest of you
is outta place... ♪</i>

58:34.202 --> 58:36.104
That's it. Fox.

58:36.204 --> 58:38.546
<i>♪ Fox on the run ♪</i>

58:38.646 --> 58:42.269
<i>♪ You scream

58:42.369 --> 58:43.750
<i>♪ A-running ♪</i>

58:43.850 --> 58:46.353
<i>♪ Take a run

58:51.257 --> 58:53.079
Okay, check it out,
he was here last night.

58:53.179 --> 58:55.721
He was driving a truck
with a fox logo on the side.

58:55.821 --> 58:58.884
Now, listen, does anybody
know his... his call sign?

58:58.984 --> 59:00.886
FoxCo.
FoxCo Shipping.

59:00.986 --> 59:03.328
Must be Pickleback.

59:03.428 --> 59:05.250
Fucking Pickleback.
Okay, great.

59:05.350 --> 59:07.171
Get Pickleback
on the radio, all right.

59:07.271 --> 59:08.813
Tell him to take a look
at his dash cam footage

59:08.913 --> 59:10.054
from last night.

59:10.154 --> 59:11.375
The cops are gonna
want to see that.

59:11.475 --> 59:12.856
It's gonna prove
they got the wrong lady

59:12.956 --> 59:15.058
sitting in a jail cell
right now.

59:15.158 --> 59:16.139
I knew she didn't do it.

59:16.239 --> 59:18.101
We'll find him. Okay.

59:18.201 --> 59:19.462
Huh, Pickleback.

59:24.447 --> 59:25.428
Can I help you?

59:25.528 --> 59:26.789
Have you seen this woman?

59:26.889 --> 59:28.951
She used your ATM
about four hours ago.

59:29.051 --> 59:30.753
Oh yeah, she just left.

59:30.853 --> 59:32.314
You know where she went?

59:32.414 --> 59:34.416
Not sure.

59:37.579 --> 59:39.761
I think she said
she was going to LA.

59:39.861 --> 59:41.802
Are you sure?
Yeah.

59:41.902 --> 59:45.926
She said she loves the beach,
sand, swimming. All of it.

59:48.108 --> 59:49.609
I found her.

59:49.709 --> 59:52.512
Yeah. She's headed West. LA.

1:00:09.407 --> 1:00:11.789
When I brought
her car around, I...

1:00:11.889 --> 1:00:14.552
I noticed that somebody had
been messing with her brakes.

1:00:14.652 --> 1:00:16.033
Imagine that?

1:00:16.133 --> 1:00:18.495
So I fixed 'em for her,
you know, gratis.

1:00:22.339 --> 1:00:23.800
Well, wait.

1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:26.442
What are you...
you saying?

1:00:26.542 --> 1:00:30.406
I've always treated you
like you were my own son.

1:00:30.506 --> 1:00:32.127
Abe, I don't know
what you think.

1:00:32.227 --> 1:00:34.229
But it's not my fault.

1:00:34.630 --> 1:00:36.291
That bitch...

1:00:36.391 --> 1:00:37.853
she had it out for me,
I swear.

1:00:37.953 --> 1:00:39.174
She... she was trying
to frame me.

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:42.036
She was...
she was the one who did it.

1:00:42.036 --> 1:00:43.458
