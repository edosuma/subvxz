Previously on Gilmore girls:

00:04.003 --> 00:05.214
Luke is a great guy.

00:05.297 --> 00:06.381
He's very special.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.383
You're incredibly lucky to have him.

00:08.467 --> 00:09.468
Are you sleeping with him?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.594
Excuse me?

00:10.677 --> 00:12.221
- I have to go.
- Can I get your number?

00:12.304 --> 00:14.640
Last name's Kim.
We're the only ones in Stars Hollow.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.392
I just gave my number
to a potential Korean doctor.

00:17.476 --> 00:21.063
You don't know anything about me,
or my life, or my mom, or Luke.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.315
So why don't you Dr. Laura someone else?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.526
I'm going inside. Stay out of my fridge.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.027
- Hello.
- Hold on.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.321
- Henry?
- Here.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.364
- Lane?
- Here.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.657
Okay, talk to you later.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.325
Rory, how are you?

00:33.408 --> 00:34.743
I'm good. How're you doing?

00:34.826 --> 00:36.787
- Jackson?
- What?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.039
Would you like to go to dinner sometime...

00:39.122 --> 00:40.165
with me?

00:40.249 --> 00:41.291
Okay.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.334
I'm sorry.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.628
That kid is more screwed up
than you think he is.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.838
What are you talking about?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.840
Get off me, man, I'm not fighting you.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.216
Jess, knock it off man.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.676
What the hell is your problem?

00:50.759 --> 00:51.844
Nothing.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.389
- I'm not ready for marriage.
- Okay.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.975
However, I'd be willing to move in.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.270
- Move in where?
- Move in with you.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.022
Jackson, you're hilarious.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.358
You stole my book.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.485
I just wanted to put
some notes in the margins.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.863
- You've read this before.
- About 40 times.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.447
I thought said you didn't read much.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.992
- Good night, Rory.
- Good night, Dodger.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.162
- Dodger?
- Figure it out.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.291
Oliver Twist.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.887
I've decided I'm saving myself
for William Holden.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.847
It's nice out here in left field.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.099
Sunset Boulevard was on last night.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.810
I've known him for years,
Sabrina, Stalag 17...

01:41.894 --> 01:44.062
- yet, last night, something snapped.
- I'll say.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.231
- It was the monkey scene.
- You know he's dead?

01:46.315 --> 01:47.774
- The monkey?
- William Holden.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.943
Every great relationship has its obstacles.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.987
You'd know
if you weren't dating Andy Hardy.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.280
- This one?
- No.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.365
- Why?
- It's too big. It raises expectations.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.284
Like there's a home-cooked lunch in there?

01:57.367 --> 02:00.078
Instead of the leftovers
in our refrigerator? Exactly.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.580
Okay. Going back on the pile now.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.040
It's quaint, isn't it?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.001
The women make a nice lunch basket,
the men bid on it...

02:06.084 --> 02:08.127
and the world rotates
backwards on its axis.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.338
I think it's fun.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.466
That's because you have a pretty boy
to bid on your basket.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.801
- Yes, I do.
- Did you tell him to eat lunch first?

02:14.885 --> 02:17.387
I love him. Of course.
I'm gonna look in the back.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.723
All right, I'll hit the front.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.726
Patty, shopping for baskets?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.938
- Please. I bought my basket weeks ago.
- Always prepared.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.648
I'm getting that itch again.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.609
No, Patty. You don't actually
need another husband.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.529
Need? No. But want?
That's a different story.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.323
Listen, darling, do you happen
to have change for $1?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.700
- I think so.
- I don't know where my quarters go.

02:38.784 --> 02:42.746
- Down some guy's G-string, I expect.
- No. A quarter would be insulting.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.207
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you so...

02:45.290 --> 02:47.376
- I got it.
- No, that's okay.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.879
This is a picture of me.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.881
- It is?
- Yeah.

02:53.173 --> 02:57.302
- Why do you have a picture of me?
- Well, it's a very nice picture.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.763
Thank you. Why do you have
a very nice picture of me?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.306
- I'm a stalker?
- Or?

03:01.390 --> 03:04.309
Or when, in my daily travels...

03:04.351 --> 03:07.813
- I run across a nice, single guy...
- Oh, God!

03:07.855 --> 03:11.817
I like to have a visual aid to help me
with the wonderful buildup I give you.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.153
I appreciate the gesture,
but I don't need you to set me up.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.699
You're such a beautiful girl,
and you deserve a nice guy.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.326
I'll have a nice guy,
but let me find him, okay?

03:21.410 --> 03:22.828
But you're no good at finding him.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.205
- Patty.
- All right.

03:25.289 --> 03:28.208
Thank you. I'll keep this, if you don't mind.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.461
Stubborn girl.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.716
Not that one.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.510
- You get no say in the basket.
- I have to bid on it.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.805
And you have to eat what's inside,
and get no say on that either.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.348
- Hey.
- Yeah?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.642
- Is Taylor behind me?
- No.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.151
What, Taylor?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.236
- Jess.
- Sorry to intrude.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.321
Why did you?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.032
You're having a vertical
From Here To Eternity moment...

04:00.073 --> 04:01.867
right in front of the super glue.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.703
Not that that's not
an appropriate place, but...

04:04.745 --> 04:07.748
- Here's your glue.
- Thanks. As you were.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.293
- I really hate that guy.
- He didn't do anything.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.212
He's here, he's breathing. That's enough.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.464
- I wish you two could start over.
- Why?

04:15.547 --> 04:19.134
He lives here. We run into him. He goes
to your school. It would be easier.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.763
- I'm fine with the whole hating him thing.
- I think it's a waste of energy.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.516
- I'll have a PowerBar.
- Fine. Forget it.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.478
So, I should probably get back to work.
We still on for tonight?

04:29.561 --> 04:33.273
- I don't know. I might be baking.
- I'll pick you up at 7:00.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.860
- Get that one. It's nice and small.
- Bye.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.409
- God!
- Sorry.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.995
Two-for-one sale.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.473
Independence Inn. Lorelai speaking.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.185
Sure. What dates are you looking at?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.103
Hold on one sec.

05:53.812 --> 05:57.774
Would you like a king or a queen-size bed?
You have your choice.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.653
I've got a room with the king-size
and a room with two queens.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.826
Well, do you think you'll make up by then?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.914
Yikes! I would take the room
with the two queens.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.920
Oh, God! Sorry.
No, nothing. Nothing's wrong.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.963
Everything's... Yes, great.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.925
Call me back when you know.
Okay. Thank you.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.638
So, Patty has taken it upon herself
to find me a man.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.847
- Really?
- Yes.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.518
In my hand I have the pictures
and resumes of the top three contenders.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.852
- Anyone good?
- No.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.522
Two of them have run with the bulls.
This is humiliating.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.731
I can find my own man.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.651
- She just loves you.
- Yeah, but, you know...

06:41.026 --> 06:44.279
- Sookie? L...
- Jackson, don't look! Cover your eyes!

06:44.363 --> 06:47.533
Okay, I'm sorry. Now, why am I doing this?

06:47.616 --> 06:50.953
Because I'm baking for the picnic,
and it's supposed to be a surprise.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.997
Sure. Never see a pie before an auction.
It's bad luck.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.751
You talk. I have to call Patty
and stop the forced mating process.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.169
I feel like Ling-Ling the panda.

06:59.253 --> 07:03.090
One of them's seen Ghostbusters
124 times. Can you say 'score'?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.800
Okay. What's up?

07:04.883 --> 07:09.137
I'm sorry, can I put my hand down?
I need to look at you when I talk.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.266
Hold on.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.727
Go.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.730
I got a call from my landlord
reminding me my lease is up...

07:18.814 --> 07:20.190
at the end of this month.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.235
He wanted to know whether I was
gonna re-up it or not.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.446
But I told him
that I had to talk to you first.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.575
- Okay. About what?
- About re-upping my lease.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.119
So what do you think?

07:32.202 --> 07:35.956
About re-upping your lease?
Well, you have a very nice kitchen.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.040
Yes. I know.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.586
I like your living room, though that house
across the street has that...

07:40.669 --> 07:42.296
creepy Miami Beach blue...

07:42.379 --> 07:44.923
which means, in the day,
you can't look out your window.

07:45.007 --> 07:48.427
- But at night it's not so bad.
- Forget about the house across the street.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.306
If you forget about the house across
the street, I don't see why you shouldn't.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.640
- You don't?
- No.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.979
Okay. Fine.
I just wanted to check with you first.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.772
I appreciate that.

08:00.856 --> 08:04.109
So I guess I'll go re-up my lease then.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.737
- Sounds good.
- Yeah. Sounds good.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.658
- Know what's great about the festival?
- What?

08:11.742 --> 08:13.952
It always falls on the day after trash day.

08:13.994 --> 08:18.248
So everything you forgot to throw out,
and would be stuck with for a week...

08:18.332 --> 08:21.460
you can instead put in a pretty basket
and auction off for charity.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.836
That is wonderful.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.254
I've got it all worked out.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.883
I invited my cousin David
to come and bid on my basket...

08:27.966 --> 08:29.510
you know, to keep my mother happy.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.136
Then we tell my mom
we're gonna go eat at the park...

08:32.221 --> 08:35.765
where Henry's gonna call on the payphone
at 2:00 for the alI's clear sign.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.643
Then David will disappear.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.187
Henry will arrive,
and we'll have our first date.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.270
My head is spinning.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.982
- Stash this at Miss Patty's.
- Don't you need it for David?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.400
No, my mom packed that one.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.237
Homemade granola, wheatgrass juice,
soy-chicken taco.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.655
Our lunches are looking good.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.697
This is the Henry basket.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.284
I went by Gianelli's
and got meatball heroes and some chips.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.120
I also packed a change of clothes,
makeup, makeup remover...

08:57.162 --> 08:59.581
- and three temporary tattoos.
- 'Cause four is trashy.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.167
I gotta go. Got to sneak back in my house!

09:02.876 --> 09:04.419
I'm so excited!

09:05.838 --> 09:09.675
Man. I remember the days of lying
to my mother about a boy.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.470
Once I had a boy hidden in the closet.
Of course Mom wouldn't leave.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.098
I finally pretended to get sick
to get her out...

09:16.181 --> 09:20.018
long enough for him to climb out
the window and down the tree.

09:20.227 --> 09:24.064
He fell. Broke his leg. To be young again.

09:25.482 --> 09:30.237
Sold for $15 to the man in the yellow!
Thank you very much.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.366
Now, the next basket I have here
is a lovely green-wicker number...

09:34.449 --> 09:37.995
that would be a charming addition
to any room once the lunch is gone.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.956
- Let's start the bidding at $5. Do I hear $5?
- $5.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.418
- Okay, I have $5. Do I hear $10?
- $10.

09:46.503 --> 09:50.591
- Withdrawn.
- Okay, I'm still at $5. Do I hear $10?

09:52.301 --> 09:55.053
$5 going once, $5 going twice.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.182
Sold to the young man for $5!

09:59.016 --> 10:01.518
You know what's nice?
You can put extra rolls of...

10:01.602 --> 10:04.062
toilet paper in there
and stick it in the bathroom.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.148
Decorative and convenient.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.400
- This may not look like much...
- Mine.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.443
Nice.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.112
But remember, people,
good things come in small packages.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.573
How badly does he want to be hosting
a game show?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.616
He can taste it.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.618
Let's start the bidding at $3.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.328
$5.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.289
He's good. He's very good.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.875
- $5. Do I hear $10?
- $10.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.753
- Okay, I have $10. Do I hear $15?
- $20.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.880
- $20, do I hear $25?
- $30.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.175
You boys don't seem to understand
the way this works.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.927
- $40.
- $50.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.721
Have either of you noticed
how tiny this thing is?

10:37.804 --> 10:40.807
- $75.
- We're not talking sense, gentlemen...

10:40.891 --> 10:42.434
- Dean's hesitating.
- $80.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.729
- He doesn't have $80 to spend on a basket.
- $90.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.774
You know, I don't think he'll have to.

10:48.815 --> 10:53.487
Okay, we've got $90 going once,
$90 going twice...

10:54.488 --> 10:58.200
sold to the nice young hoodlum
in the back for $90.

10:58.283 --> 11:02.287
I'm trying to think in what scenario
this could be construed as positive.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.998
- Well?
- No one's head is on fire.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.417
- I better go talk to Dean.
- Do you want help?

11:07.501 --> 11:10.712
No, it's okay. I'm just officially
not a fan of unpredictability.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.965
Totally understand. Good luck.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.884
$5 on this one. Do I hear $5?

11:16.134 --> 11:18.720
$5, that's good. How about $10?

11:18.804 --> 11:22.349
- I'll go $10.
- $10. Let's keep going. Look at its size.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.435
I'm gonna kill him!

11:25.477 --> 11:28.438
- He's probably just fooling around.
- He was messing with me!

11:28.480 --> 11:31.608
He was messing with me,
and it's the last time, I swear to God.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.360
- Calm down.
- Why would he do this?

11:33.443 --> 11:34.820
Maybe he was hungry.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.947
- He's trying to make me crazy.
- Don't let him.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.409
Of all the nutty, barn-raising shindigs
this town can cook up...

11:40.492 --> 11:41.660
this one wasn't half bad.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.037
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- I did. Shall we?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.789
- Shall we what?
- Shall we go?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.040
- Go where?
- Go eat.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.125
Excuse me?

11:48.167 --> 11:50.919
Person who buys the basket
wins the company of the person...

11:51.003 --> 11:52.004
who makes the basket.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.883
Basket. Basket maker.
Guy who didn't bring enough money.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.009
You think this is funny?

11:57.092 --> 11:59.511
It's no Lenny Bruce routine,
but it has its moments.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.596
Bye, Jess.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.264
- Where you going?
- You're going.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.725
- As soon as Rory's ready.
- She's not going with you.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.810
- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.688
Excuse me, Edgar Bergen,
I'd like Charlie McCarthy to answer.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.148
- Shut up.
- Dean.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.983
- What?
- Well...

12:13.066 --> 12:15.444
- Come on.
- It's tradition.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.695
I don't believe this.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.281
My mother and I
have been doing this every year.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.699
So buck tradition.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.785
Do you remember how mad Taylor was
when I couldn't go...

12:23.869 --> 12:25.162
to the turkey-calling contest?

12:25.204 --> 12:27.498
This isn't school.
You're not getting graded.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.666
- Don't make this into a big thing.
- Don't go.

12:29.750 --> 12:34.171
- Man, she's not shipping off to'Nam.
- You so need to shut up now.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.715
Dean, it's a picnic. It's lunch.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.592
- We'll sit, we'll eat, it's over.
- No.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.304
- What do you think is gonna happen?
- I think I'd like to hear this one also.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.597
I don't want you to go.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.807
- Dean...
- Fine, forget it. Go.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.604
Please don't walk away like that.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.899
Sorry, I'd do a silly walk, but I'm not
feeling very John Cleese now.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.903
This isn't my fault. I didn't ask him
to do that. I didn't tell him to do that.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.989
You're my boyfriend.
I would never do anything to hurt you.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.367
Yeah? You're doing it right now.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.580
Going once, going twice...

13:09.164 --> 13:12.042
sold for $25!

13:12.251 --> 13:14.461
Congratulations. Thank you.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.882
Lord, will you look at this?

13:18.966 --> 13:22.010
Ladies and gentlemen,
now this is a basket.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.430
Let's start the bidding
on this delicious treat at $10.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.349
- Do I hear $10?
- $10.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.767
$15.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.769
- I have $15.
- $20.

13:30.811 --> 13:34.773
- $20. I have $20. Is that my final offer?
- All right, fine. $25.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.526
Kirk, you just offered $20.
You upped your own bid.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.736
Can we stop the bidding for just a second?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.530
- Sookie, you know the rules.
- Yes, but...

13:41.613 --> 13:44.950
We have $25. Do I hear $30?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.452
- Jackson.
- $30, if there's pie.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.289
- There are no contingencies, Andrew.
- $35.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.582
- Andrew?
- Jackson?

13:51.623 --> 13:53.750
I'm not going higher
without the promise of pie.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.337
I have $35 going once, $35 going twice.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.924
- Sold to Kirk for $35.
- Yes. Finally.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.261
If it hadn't been for me,
I could have had it for $25.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.514
What is wrong with you?
I gave you all the signs.

14:07.598 --> 14:11.185
The pointing, the waving, the mouthing,
'That's my basket. '

14:11.268 --> 14:13.770
- Didn't you see the mouthing?
- I saw the mouthing.

14:13.812 --> 14:17.191
- Why didn't you bid?
- I don't know. It just didn't feel right.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.483
What are you talking about?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.445
I made four kinds of pesto
and three different desserts.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.948
Plus, the entire basket is an edible pretzel
with a goat-cheese filling.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.326
- I hope Kirk enjoys it.
- I don't understand.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.161
- Come on, Sookie.
- What?

14:29.244 --> 14:32.164
I told you the lease was up
on my apartment, and I asked you...

14:32.206 --> 14:35.209
if you thought I should renew the lease,
and you said yes.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.585
Do you not like that apartment?

14:36.668 --> 14:40.881
No, I love that apartment. It's perfect.
The ultimate bachelor pad.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.175
It's just big enough for one.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.345
Only, here's the thing.
We've been dating for a while...

14:46.428 --> 14:48.514
and I thought
things were going pretty well.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.932
Things are going really well.

14:50.015 --> 14:53.602
So I had this crazy thought
that since things were going really well...

14:53.685 --> 14:56.230
that maybe it was time
to take a step forward.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.689
You wanted to move in together?

14:57.773 --> 15:00.943
I at least wanted to consider
moving in together.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.696
I hadn't even thought about it.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.032
- You hadn't?
- Well, no.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.203
My mistake then. I thought
we were on the same wavelength.

15:11.245 --> 15:14.039
We weren't. No problem. Enjoy your lunch.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.836
Jackson, I lied.
I have thought about it. A lot.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.964
Our bathroom's gonna be pink. I'm sorry.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.007
Why didn't you say something?

15:24.091 --> 15:27.511
I didn't want to ruin anything.
We're doing so well.

15:27.553 --> 15:30.138
We have so much fun. It's all working.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.391
Why would living together
mess all that up?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.768
I don't know.
We'd see each other every day.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.603
We see each other every day now.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.189
And you'd find out all
my annoying little quirks.

15:39.273 --> 15:42.067
- I've got annoying quirks, too, you know.
- I know.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.903
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You might get sick of me.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.739
- Or you might get sick of me.
- No, that's not gonna happen.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.076
If that's not gonna happen,
then what's the problem?

15:52.202 --> 15:55.747
The problem is that Kirk
is gonna eat my goat-cheese basket.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.542
Not if I have anything to say about it.

15:59.293 --> 16:03.213
$12. Do I hear any more?
Can we get any higher than $12?

16:03.422 --> 16:05.382
How's that for not getting sick of you?

16:05.424 --> 16:08.552
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a basket to get.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.888
Next up, what?

16:10.929 --> 16:13.974
That looks like
a Doose's Market basket. Nice?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.267
That's mine.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.353
- I'd like to start the bidding at $5.
- I bid $5.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.980
- That was quick.
- $10.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.774
All that's in there is two stale Pop-Tarts
and a Slim Jim.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.651
- $15.
- He looks familiar.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.445
- $20.
- So does he.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.947
- $25.
- This is going very well.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.490
- Oh, no.
- $30.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.453
- Those are the guys, aren't they?
- Excuse me?

16:34.495 --> 16:37.706
The guys whose pictures you sent me.
You brought them here.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.375
Darling, you can't be trusted
to do it yourself.

16:40.459 --> 16:41.585
Jeez.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.838
- $35.
- That one's a snorkeler.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.174
$35, now we're back on track. Keep it up.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.264
Luke. Where is he? I need him, Caesar.
Thank God!

16:54.348 --> 16:56.642
- You gotta come with me.
- What are you doing?

16:56.683 --> 16:59.228
- I got plates here.
- Caesar, you're in charge.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.439
Do you have money? I need it.
Which one opens this thing? That one?

17:02.481 --> 17:04.650
- Stop messing with that.
- You gotta come with me.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.277
Patty gave my picture out
'cause she thinks I need a man.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.738
You need one with a couch
and a knowledge of Freud.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.906
You have to come out
and bid on my basket.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.951
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

17:14.034 --> 17:18.204
I have never in my life taken part
in one of these crazy group flip-outs...

17:18.288 --> 17:19.915
and I'm not about to start now.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.667
- But, right now, out there...
- Just buy your own basket.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.002
- I cannot buy my own basket.
- Why not?

17:25.087 --> 17:26.630
Because that is pathetic.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.758
And chasing me around my diner,
begging me to buy your basket?

17:29.842 --> 17:31.677
Also pathetic, but that I can live with...

17:31.718 --> 17:33.929
where that pathetic
is truly pathetic-pathetic...

17:34.012 --> 17:37.224
and only you can save me
from the double pathetic. Please.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.561
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Hurry up.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.484
- $45.50.
- $46.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.152
- $46.50.
- $47.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.864
- Go on.
- $47, are you kidding?

17:51.947 --> 17:53.448
- Luke.
- $47.50.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.659
For two stale Pop-Tarts and a Slim Jim?

17:55.701 --> 17:57.911
You're not getting the whole
saving me thing.

17:57.995 --> 18:01.373
- Fine. $48.
- $48.50.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.001
- $49.
- $49.50.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.712
$52.50.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.214
What? We're just supposed to go to $50.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.091
- I have a life.
- $52.50. Going once.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.718
That's my job.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.889
- $52.50 going once, $52.50 going twice.
- Please, God.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.391
- Sold for $52.50.
- Yes!

18:20.225 --> 18:23.854
Sorry, don't feel bad. I'm totally into
Dungeons & Dragons. You've skated.

18:23.896 --> 18:27.149
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
concludes the basket bidding.

18:27.232 --> 18:31.904
Victors, come claim your prizes
and your dates. Let the lunching begin!

18:35.449 --> 18:36.491
- You rock.
- Thank you.

18:36.575 --> 18:37.701
- Welcome.
- What do we do now?

18:37.743 --> 18:38.994
- I guess we eat.
- This?

18:39.077 --> 18:40.954
- Yeah.
- I have to buy and eat it?

18:41.038 --> 18:43.290
The basket of botulism
does come with my company.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.209
You don't eat with your mouth open,
do you?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.920
Women don't eat. We look at food
and jump on the treadmill.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.004
All right, let's go.

18:49.922 --> 18:53.133
- You know, there's nothing there.
- Yes, I know.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.637
- You going after him?
- Not right now.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.514
So, then, shall we?

19:01.225 --> 19:02.935
Fine. Come on.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.900
- Yeah, I think so.
- I can't wait to eat.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.404
- Kirk, I've been looking all over for you.
- Any idea what this is?

19:14.488 --> 19:17.282
Yeah, it's a pineapple-cranberry chutney.

19:17.908 --> 19:20.619
Listen, I'd like to talk to you
about this basket.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.872
As you know, Sookie made it,
and since we are seeing each other...

19:23.956 --> 19:26.375
naturally, she assumed
that I would bid on it.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.419
Where are the carrot sticks?
Every lunch has carrot sticks.

19:29.503 --> 19:32.422
But, see, I was a little upset
about a fight we had...

19:32.506 --> 19:34.258
and so I didn't bid on the basket.

19:34.299 --> 19:37.052
I love carrot sticks.
Especially the crinkle-cut kind.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.889
However, we just made up,
and now I'd like to have lunch with Sookie.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.683
So...

19:44.142 --> 19:45.811
I need the basket.

19:46.103 --> 19:47.646
This is my basket.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.691
I'd like you to give it to me,
so I can have lunch with Sookie.

19:50.774 --> 19:54.820
I bought it. The rules are, whoever
bids the highest gets the basket.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.446
Yes, I understand the rules, but...

19:56.530 --> 19:58.782
I bid the highest,
I bought the basket, I get it.

19:58.824 --> 20:02.995
Okay, Kirk, I'll pay you for it.
I'll give you $45.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.873
- That's $10 more than you paid for it.
- No.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.750
- Okay. $50.
- No.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.379
Kirk, this is insane!
I'll buy you another basket.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.298
I don't need you to buy me another basket.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.342
I won this one. You can't just come by
and take it away.

20:17.426 --> 20:20.345
Just because you have a girlfriend
who made a basket for you...

20:20.387 --> 20:23.724
doesn't give you the right
to bully those who don't have girlfriends...

20:23.807 --> 20:26.393
- to make them a basket.
- I wasn't trying to bully you.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.937
Not this year, not last year,
not the year before that.

20:29.021 --> 20:32.357
- My mother didn't even make one for me.
- That's very sad.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.818
She made one for my brothers
and sisters, but not me.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.821
- That's terrible, Kirk.
- Twelve brothers and sisters.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.282
The only one without a basket, me.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.493
Okay, Kirk, what's it gonna take?

20:42.534 --> 20:44.995
- $250.
- You're kidding me!

20:45.162 --> 20:48.123
- Twelve brothers and sisters.
- Will you take a check?

20:48.207 --> 20:50.000
With two forms of ID.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.670
I swear, you'd better be as pathetic
as you sound.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.047
Trust me.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.675
- What time is it?
- 3:00.

20:58.759 --> 21:01.094
I don't understand.
Henry should have called by now.

21:01.178 --> 21:04.056
- Give me some change.
- There.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.229
- Oh, my God! It's not working.
- Great.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.981
- Can I have his lunch now?
- I'll be right back.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.900
We're supposed to be eating
on the ground.

21:14.942 --> 21:15.943
Says who?

21:16.026 --> 21:18.904
Every picture of a picnic
shows people eating on the ground.

21:18.946 --> 21:22.241
Every time I have seen a picture
of people eating on the ground...

21:22.324 --> 21:25.369
I've thought,'What the hell
are you doing sitting on the ground?'

21:25.452 --> 21:27.663
Spring for some beach chairs,
you cheapskates.

21:27.746 --> 21:31.083
- Lorelai, do you have your cell phone?
- Yeah, is everything okay?

21:31.166 --> 21:32.584
- I just need to make a call.
- Here.

21:32.668 --> 21:34.419
I'll be right back!

21:34.586 --> 21:36.380
Where are you going?

21:36.421 --> 21:39.591
I am going to the diner, I am going
to get us some edible food...

21:39.675 --> 21:41.885
and I'm gonna bring it back here
for us to eat.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.805
That is so not the point of today.
I made this. I am insulted.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.349
- I will now proceed to pout.
- I'll bring back brownies.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.852
The pouting has left the building.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.115
- Hello?
- Hello, Henry?

22:03.156 --> 22:06.243
- I've been trying to call you.
- I know. The pay phone is broken.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.579
I thought the number was wrong, so I...

22:08.620 --> 22:11.206
- What? You what?
- I called your house...

22:11.290 --> 22:13.250
- and your mother answered.
- What did you say?

22:13.333 --> 22:15.294
I asked for you, and then she asked why.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.504
I said because. She said because why?

22:17.588 --> 22:21.466
I got nervous and tried to sell her
a subscription to The Wall Street Journal.

22:21.550 --> 22:22.968
Were you successful?

22:23.051 --> 22:25.095
- Lane.
- Sorry. But she doesn't know, right?

22:25.137 --> 22:27.598
- I guess not.
- Then we're still good.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.766
- Can you meet me now?
- I don't know.

22:29.808 --> 22:32.769
It's later than we planned,
but we still have a little time...

22:32.811 --> 22:34.980
- and I saved your lunch from David.
- David?

22:35.063 --> 22:37.107
- My cousin. The decoy.
- Right.

22:37.191 --> 22:40.903
We'll rendezvous where I told you.
Drive by, honk twice, go around the block.

22:40.986 --> 22:42.821
The second time you pass, I'll jump in.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.908
- Do you want me to slow down?
- Yeah, of course.

22:45.991 --> 22:49.786
- Not to a total stop, but...
- Lane, I don't think this is gonna work.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.914
- What?
- This. You, me.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.499
Are you breaking up with me?

22:53.582 --> 22:55.417
How can I? I've never been out with you.

22:55.501 --> 22:58.045
Yeah, but that's what today
was supposed to be. A date.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.006
A date where we need a secret plan
and a two-honk drive-by...

23:01.048 --> 23:03.383
- and a decoy cousin?
- Well, yeah.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.637
Lane, I like you, but I want to be able
to pick you up...

23:06.720 --> 23:10.098
stop the car, and take you out.
And I want to be able to call you.

23:10.182 --> 23:11.183
At your house.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.101
I'm gonna tell my mother. I promise.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.020
- When?
- Soon.

23:15.354 --> 23:19.483
Yeah. Look, I've got prom coming up...

23:19.525 --> 23:22.611
and my friends and I
are gonna rent a limo to take us there...

23:22.694 --> 23:25.030
and I want to go,
and I want to take a date.

23:25.113 --> 23:28.033
I'm sure I can figure something out.
Maybe Rory can...

23:28.075 --> 23:29.952
I asked somebody else.

23:33.163 --> 23:36.250
I'm sorry, I just figured
you'd never be able to go and...

23:36.333 --> 23:39.127
It's okay. You should've asked
someone else.

23:39.211 --> 23:40.671
I do like you, Lane.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.799
Okay, well, thank you. I appreciate that.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.592
- I have to go.
- Lane.

23:51.390 --> 23:54.476
David came by here 15 minutes ago!
Said you ran off somewhere.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.811
- Where did you run?
- Nowhere.

23:55.894 --> 23:58.021
Who is he? The boy you ran off to see?

23:58.063 --> 24:01.441
The one who calls here pretending
to work for The Wall Street Journal.

24:01.525 --> 24:04.194
- There's no boy!
- You know the rules. No boys!

24:04.236 --> 24:06.071
Not unless I approve, and I don't!

24:06.113 --> 24:07.990
- How do you know?
- I know!

24:08.073 --> 24:11.034
You're sneaking, you're lying.
Something's wrong with this boy.

24:11.076 --> 24:14.454
There's nothing wrong!
He's perfect and he likes me...

24:14.538 --> 24:16.248
and I was so afraid to tell you that...

24:16.331 --> 24:19.001
that he's taking somebody else
to the prom! And I blew it.

24:19.084 --> 24:21.545
- You go upstairs and calm down!
- Fine!

24:21.628 --> 24:23.005
- Now!
- Fine!

24:24.548 --> 24:26.550
That is not calming down!

24:27.301 --> 24:29.720
- Where do you want to eat?
- Don't care.

24:29.761 --> 24:30.888
Okay.

24:31.305 --> 24:34.224
- Where are you going?
- Thought you didn't care.

24:34.266 --> 24:36.226
I'm not jumping in the lake.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.562
No underwater dining. Got it.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.819
- Now what?
- Now we sit.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.279
- Here?
- Yep.

24:47.696 --> 24:50.407
On the bridge?
That's where we're going to eat?

24:51.408 --> 24:53.702
- Okay.
- I like this place.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.581
Wow, a place in Stars Hollow
you actually like. I'm stunned.

24:57.623 --> 24:59.374
It's got some good memories.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.084
- See right over there?
- Yep.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.462
That's where Luke pushed me in.

25:03.879 --> 25:04.922
- That's nice.
- It is.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.465
- So why'd you do it?
- Do what?

25:06.507 --> 25:08.884
- Outbid Dean like that.
- I don't know.

25:08.967 --> 25:12.596
I guess it started as a joke just to bug him,
but then he just got so mad...

25:12.638 --> 25:15.307
and he's so tall, and I just was...

25:15.390 --> 25:20.103
looking at him and he's standing there
all tall and mad, and I don't know...

25:20.145 --> 25:22.397
- it was really funny.
- It wasn't funny.

25:22.481 --> 25:26.443
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I didn't intend to do it.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.113
Does that make you feel any better?

25:30.197 --> 25:32.282
I just don't want to be in a fight with Dean.

25:32.324 --> 25:35.452
I'm sorry about that.
You want to push me in the lake?

25:35.536 --> 25:38.455
- It's cathartic, I hear.
- Maybe in a little bit.

25:38.497 --> 25:39.790
Whenever.

25:40.082 --> 25:42.876
- So when do we open this thing?
- Go ahead.

25:45.546 --> 25:49.758
Wow, not one thing in here
that I would remotely consider eating.

25:49.842 --> 25:52.719
I didn't make it for you. I made it for Dean.

25:53.512 --> 25:56.849
- And Dean would have eaten this?
- Yes, he would have.

26:04.523 --> 26:08.193
- Dean is an idiot.
- Dean never would have fallen for that.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.824
I can't believe
he wouldn't take your check.

26:13.866 --> 26:15.951
Well, apparently,
I don't look like my picture.

26:16.034 --> 26:18.328
- He's a loon.
- Yeah. It's okay.

26:18.453 --> 26:22.040
I'm paying him off in weekly installments
in crinkle-cut carrot sticks.

26:22.124 --> 26:24.835
- I'm glad we made up.
- Yeah, me, too.

26:25.210 --> 26:29.840
And, you know, if you still wanted
to talk about, you know...

26:29.882 --> 26:33.218
what we were talking about,
we could talk about it now.

26:34.219 --> 26:36.805
- No.
- Excuse me?

26:36.889 --> 26:40.309
- I don't know. I'm having second thoughts.
- You are?

26:40.392 --> 26:43.020
Yeah, I mean, living together,
big deal, right?

26:43.061 --> 26:47.399
Oh, right. Big deal. Who cares?

26:47.858 --> 26:50.861
Not me. No sirree Bob.

26:52.738 --> 26:56.700
So, I'm sorry, you don't think
we should live together anymore?

26:56.867 --> 26:58.535
- Nope.
- Okay.

26:58.744 --> 27:00.996
I think we should get married.

27:01.330 --> 27:02.414
What?

27:03.874 --> 27:06.126
I think we should get married.

27:06.752 --> 27:09.546
- But...
- Soon.

27:09.755 --> 27:12.216
- Are you pregnant?
- What do you say?

27:15.385 --> 27:18.388
- Sookie?
- Yes!

27:19.097 --> 27:22.935
I say yes! Oh, my God,
we're getting married!

27:26.730 --> 27:29.525
You do know that this means
we'll have to live together?

27:29.608 --> 27:31.860
- Yes, I do.
- Okay, good.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.909
You know your burgers
actually taste better outside?

27:38.951 --> 27:41.453
Good, the next time the roof
in the diner's leaking...

27:41.537 --> 27:44.039
I'll just rip the stupid thing off.

27:44.623 --> 27:47.584
This is nice, huh? Come on. Admit it.

27:47.668 --> 27:48.710
- Never.
- What?

27:48.794 --> 27:51.672
You'd much rather be sitting
out here than inside working.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.424
- Diner's probably on fire by now.
- You are stubborn.

27:54.466 --> 27:56.385
- I'm stubborn?
- Yeah, you're stubborn.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.928
From Miss Flexibility over here?

27:58.011 --> 28:00.305
- I can be flexible.
- Please.

28:00.347 --> 28:02.766
As long as everything
is exactly the way I want it...

28:02.808 --> 28:04.935
- I'm totally flexible.
- My mistake.

28:04.977 --> 28:06.019
Do you want a fry?

28:06.103 --> 28:07.479
- You want a carrot?
- Impossible.

28:07.563 --> 28:09.231
Right back at you.

28:10.065 --> 28:13.068
- So let me ask you something.
- Napkin, please.

28:13.944 --> 28:16.238
- Who did you want to get your basket?
- What?

28:16.321 --> 28:18.699
Before you knew
Patty put you on the dating game...

28:18.782 --> 28:21.451
you did pack this disgusting lunch
and bring it out here.

28:21.493 --> 28:23.078
So who did you want to get it?

28:23.162 --> 28:26.123
Well, last year, Roy Wilkins bought it...

28:26.206 --> 28:29.209
and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.795
And this year my rain gutters
are completely clogged...

28:31.837 --> 28:34.339
and I thought if I could get
the Collins kid to bite...

28:34.381 --> 28:36.133
- I'd get that taken care of.
- Practical.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.635
- I thought so.
- So the participation in this thing...

28:38.677 --> 28:41.388
- was for home improvement reasons?
- Yes.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.308
And I don't know, it's a nice concept.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.101
What is?

28:46.185 --> 28:51.106
Just having someone who you love,
or have some kind of crazy crush on...

28:51.356 --> 28:55.736
bid on your basket and then share
a romantic lunch. It's a nice concept.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.030
Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage...

28:58.113 --> 29:01.033
to find the right guy
and drag him out to this thing...

29:01.116 --> 29:04.453
make him buy your stupid basket,
then you'll be sitting here with him.

29:04.536 --> 29:06.205
Yeah. Someday.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.919
- You know what?
- What?

29:12.878 --> 29:14.338
This is nice.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.882
I have to talk to you.

29:16.965 --> 29:20.886
- Yeah, okay. I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.

29:26.558 --> 29:30.354
- How are you doing?
- I'm not great.

29:31.063 --> 29:33.023
Dean, it's just a silly town thing.

29:33.106 --> 29:37.027
I've been telling myself that,
and I tried to forget about it, but I can't.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.111
I'm worried about Rory.

29:38.195 --> 29:40.030
She shouldn't be hanging out
with this guy.

29:40.072 --> 29:42.783
- Today was kind of...
- It's got nothing to do with today.

29:42.866 --> 29:45.786
Yes, it has a little to do with today,
but it's more than that.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.413
Ever since I met him,
I had this feeling he was bad news.

29:48.497 --> 29:52.125
- Jess has a few issues.
- One issue is that he's a complete jerk.

29:52.209 --> 29:54.253
He's always getting in fights at school...

29:54.336 --> 29:57.548
that is, when he bothers to show up at all,
and he just...

29:57.589 --> 29:59.341
I don't know. Now this thing with Rory.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.885
- It's like he's always around.
- You sound jealous.

30:01.969 --> 30:05.931
I'm not jealous. He just...
She has to be nice to everyone, you know?

30:05.973 --> 30:07.558
I know, but, hon, that's Rory.

30:07.641 --> 30:11.311
He's gonna get her into trouble.
I can feel it. I just know it.

30:11.395 --> 30:14.189
He doesn't care about her.
He's using her to drive me crazy.

30:14.273 --> 30:16.358
- Dean, you love Rory, right?
- Yeah.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.027
So part of love is trust.
You have to trust her.

30:19.111 --> 30:21.405
- I do trust her. It's...
- Him. I know.

30:21.446 --> 30:24.283
But flying off the handle
is not gonna get you what you want.

30:24.324 --> 30:27.619
She cares about you, she's not going to do
anything to mess things up.

30:27.661 --> 30:30.122
- I know this.
- I hope you're right.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.212
- Ten.
- Ten?

30:37.296 --> 30:41.675
But I didn't understand a word of it.
So I had to reread it when I was 15.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.468
I've yet to make it through it.

30:43.552 --> 30:45.804
Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic.

30:45.888 --> 30:48.098
But Ayn Rand is a political nut.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.934
Nobody could write a 40-page monologue
the way she could.

30:50.976 --> 30:53.979
Okay, tomorrow I will try again,
and you will...

30:54.021 --> 30:57.524
Give the painful Ernest Hemingway
another chance. Yes, I promise.

30:57.608 --> 31:01.153
You know, Ernest only has lovely things
to say about you.

31:01.695 --> 31:04.406
- Why are you only nice to me?
- Excuse me?

31:04.490 --> 31:08.619
An hour ago you were screwing with Dean,
and now you're nice to me.

31:09.077 --> 31:10.871
You see, it's the screwing with Dean...

31:10.954 --> 31:14.750
that's an important step to getting here,
so that I could be nice to you.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.169
- So it was a plan?
- What?

31:17.211 --> 31:20.339
The whole bidding on my basket.
It was a plan.

31:20.756 --> 31:22.549
Okay, I'm officially starving.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.219
- And officially evasive.
- Come on. I'll get you a pizza.

31:25.302 --> 31:27.221
- Answer my question.
- Do you like pepperoni?

31:27.304 --> 31:30.641
- You're not going to, are you?
- We could just get it on half.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.894
- Okay. I give. Let's go.
- If you insist.

31:55.207 --> 31:57.835
Where have you been?
I thought Taylor auctioned you off.

31:57.876 --> 32:01.839
No, I just went to get some pizza,
and I wandered around the bookstore.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.882
- Here.
- What's this?

32:03.924 --> 32:06.718
- You wanted to read The Children's Hour.
- I did? When?

32:06.802 --> 32:09.888
When we were watching Julia,
and Jane Fonda was Lillian Hellman.

32:09.972 --> 32:12.391
Yeah, and I made
the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.810
- Which no one ever needs to hear again.
- Right.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.104
- Well, thanks.
- You're welcome.

32:17.771 --> 32:19.481
- So who where you with?
- What?

32:19.565 --> 32:21.358
Pizza, book-buying.
Did you have company?

32:21.400 --> 32:23.068
- Yeah.
- Who?

32:23.777 --> 32:25.737
- Jess.
- Jess?

32:25.779 --> 32:27.239
- Yeah.
- Right.

32:28.407 --> 32:30.909
- So I'll be in my room.
- Okay. Good.

32:39.418 --> 32:41.545
- So how was the picnic?
- Fine.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.797
Good. Did you get
the Dean issue resolved?

32:43.881 --> 32:47.593
Not yet. He's coming over and we're gonna
smooth things over, hopefully.

32:47.676 --> 32:50.929
Yeah, well, smoothing's good.
I love the smoothing.

32:51.263 --> 32:53.182
So how is it with Jess?

32:53.265 --> 32:55.058
- Fine.
- Obviously.

32:55.100 --> 32:59.229
With the pizza and the books...
So good. I'm glad.

33:00.230 --> 33:01.273
- What?
- What what?

33:01.356 --> 33:03.108
You look like you have something to say.

33:03.150 --> 33:05.444
I have nothing to say.
I never have anything to say.

33:05.527 --> 33:08.947
- Yes, that is your reputation.
- It's... I don't know.

33:09.031 --> 33:11.700
I'm surprised that you're
hanging out with him.

33:11.783 --> 33:12.826
Why?

33:12.910 --> 33:15.954
- He just doesn't seem like the nicest kid.
- You don't know him.

33:16.038 --> 33:17.498
No, I guess not.

33:17.581 --> 33:19.791
You're judging him
by that one time he came here.

33:19.875 --> 33:22.127
Which, by the way,
was not a rousing success.

33:22.169 --> 33:24.880
He had just moved here.
He was mad at his mom.

33:24.963 --> 33:27.716
Trust me, he's got a really good side
to him. You'll see it.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.384
- Good, I can't wait.
- Mom.

33:29.468 --> 33:31.303
I'm sorry, I just...

33:31.386 --> 33:35.766
I don't know, from the things I've seen,
and the things I hear...

33:35.807 --> 33:36.934
Like what things?

33:36.975 --> 33:40.812
The vandalism. The stealing.
The cutting school. The fighting.

33:40.896 --> 33:43.774
- How do you know about the fighting?
- Well, Dean told me.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.275
- Dean?
- Yes.

33:45.317 --> 33:48.403
- You've been discussing this with Dean?
- He discussed it with me.

33:48.487 --> 33:51.365
- When?
- Today. He's really upset about this.

33:51.448 --> 33:52.950
So he went running to my mother?

33:53.033 --> 33:55.244
- He needed to talk.
- He could've talked to me.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.955
- He couldn't. You were with Jess.
- You're taking his side?

33:57.996 --> 34:00.415
I'm not taking sides. I'm Swiss, babe.

34:00.499 --> 34:04.670
- I wasn't off with Jess. Jess outbid him.
- I know.

34:04.753 --> 34:08.297
The rule is that if one person
outbids someone else, then...

34:08.340 --> 34:09.967
Rory, this is not about the rule.

34:10.050 --> 34:13.554
This is about Dean being concerned
that you're hanging out with someone...

34:13.637 --> 34:15.597
- who could get you hurt.
- How could he?

34:15.681 --> 34:19.059
In the short time he's been here,
he's managed to make a lot of enemies.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.853
- When did I move to Salem?
- People are concerned about you.

34:21.937 --> 34:25.690
You're young and naive and you think
that everyone has some good inside...

34:25.774 --> 34:29.027
- if you give them a chance.
- So you're saying that Jess is no good.

34:29.069 --> 34:32.739
I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool
because he's got a dangerous vibe...

34:32.822 --> 34:34.783
and this problem with authority...

34:34.867 --> 34:37.077
and he's seen
a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.413
- Oh, my God.
- But guys like this get into trouble.

34:39.496 --> 34:43.000
Which, if you hang out with him,
gets you into trouble. I don't want that.

34:43.041 --> 34:46.628
I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still,
or are we talking about you?

34:46.712 --> 34:49.505
- I've been there, okay? You haven't.
- Been where?

34:49.547 --> 34:51.967
We got pizza. We looked at some books.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.511
God, I can't even believe
I'm having this conversation.

34:54.553 --> 34:58.473
With you, of all people. I don't even
want to talk about this anymore.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.809
- Rory!
- No, I'm going for a walk.

35:00.893 --> 35:05.480
- Dean is gonna be here any minute.
- He probably wants to talk to you anyhow.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.528
A cigar club?

35:11.570 --> 35:14.907
Can you imagine
a more disgusting organization to join?

35:14.990 --> 35:16.825
Your grandfather now pays money...

35:16.909 --> 35:19.161
to sit in an enclosed room
with a bunch of men...

35:19.244 --> 35:21.038
and blow smoke in each other's faces.

35:21.079 --> 35:24.458
Twice a week he comes home
smelling like a flophouse.

35:29.254 --> 35:31.089
So I finally just confronted him.

35:31.131 --> 35:34.968
I said, 'Richard, I know you're going
through a transitional period here...

35:35.052 --> 35:37.137
'and I encourage your trying out
new things...

35:37.221 --> 35:40.599
'but this seems
completely out of character for you. '

35:42.267 --> 35:45.395
- I'm sorry, am I boring you?
- No, you're not.

35:45.437 --> 35:46.980
Sorry, Grandma.

35:47.189 --> 35:50.067
- So how are things at the Inn?
- Fine. The same.

35:50.108 --> 35:54.196
- And, Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?
- Apparently very chatty.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.406
That's nice.

35:57.616 --> 35:59.284
Lorelai, anything new with you?

35:59.368 --> 36:03.121
No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet
around the house lately.

36:03.288 --> 36:05.833
Well, sometimes quiet could be nice.

36:06.917 --> 36:08.210
Soothing.

36:09.127 --> 36:11.255
You can hear yourself think.

36:12.965 --> 36:15.342
All right, what's going on with you two?

36:15.425 --> 36:17.010
- Nothing.
- It's not nothing.

36:17.094 --> 36:20.722
You've been both sitting here, not saying
a word, not looking at each other.

36:20.806 --> 36:22.140
- Are you in a fight?
- I'm not.

36:22.182 --> 36:23.767
- Please.
- Please, what?

36:23.851 --> 36:28.272
- You have been freezing me out all week.
- I haven't had anything to say.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.650
- Who is it?
- No one.

36:31.733 --> 36:33.861
- Why won't you tell me?
- 'Cause it's no one.

36:33.944 --> 36:35.904
- Is it Jess?
- You're kidding, right?

36:35.988 --> 36:37.865
- Jess? Who's Jess?
- I'm not kidding.

36:37.948 --> 36:41.660
- Why would you assume that it's Jess?
- Why won't you tell me who it is?

36:41.743 --> 36:43.495
- Who's Jess?
- Luke's nephew.

36:43.537 --> 36:45.247
It's not Jess. It's Dean.

36:45.330 --> 36:49.042
You want to read it? Wait, no, Dean
will probably tell you all about it later.

36:49.126 --> 36:50.127
That's not funny.

36:50.169 --> 36:52.671
- All week you've been...
- We're not gonna get into this.

36:52.713 --> 36:56.592
Getting into what? Is it about this Jess,
the thing you're not getting into?

36:56.675 --> 36:59.595
- You never liked Dean at the beginning.
- I didn't know him.

36:59.678 --> 37:02.556
- And now you don't like Jess?
- That's because I know him.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.641
Are you dating Jess?
What happened to Dean?

37:04.725 --> 37:07.519
- I'm not dating Jess.
- But he's trying to weasel his way in.

37:07.603 --> 37:09.688
- He's not trying to weasel his way.
- In where?

37:09.771 --> 37:12.816
In Rory's world.
He has his eye on her, and he's trouble.

37:12.858 --> 37:15.360
- He's not trouble.
- Yes, he is.

37:15.444 --> 37:20.115
If your mother thinks he isn't appropriate
company, then you need to listen to her.

37:20.199 --> 37:21.658
There. Thank you, Mom.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.953
Excuse me, but I don't feel very hungry
right now.

37:52.814 --> 37:54.858
Kim's Antiques.
We're closed. Call tomorrow.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.902
- Mrs. Kim, it's Rory.
- It's after 9:00.

37:56.985 --> 37:58.612
- I know.
- Lane can't talk after 9:00.

37:58.695 --> 38:02.908
I promise to never again call after 9:00,
but can I please talk to her now?

38:02.991 --> 38:04.284
Just this once?

38:05.452 --> 38:07.871
- Okay. Just this once.
- Thank you.

38:12.251 --> 38:13.669
- Lane?
- What?

38:13.752 --> 38:14.711
Phone.

38:14.878 --> 38:16.922
- But it's after 9:00.
- It's okay, it's Rory.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.049
I don't want to talk right now.

38:19.132 --> 38:22.553
Rory, Lane's not feeling well.
She needs to call you tomorrow.

38:23.136 --> 38:26.181
- Okay, thanks anyhow.
- Yes. Goodbye.

38:37.359 --> 38:40.404
- It's early for you to be in bed.
- I'm tired.

38:40.779 --> 38:44.032
- Come downstairs and have some tea.
- No, thank you.

38:44.408 --> 38:46.952
I know you're upset,
but I have these rules for a reason.

38:47.035 --> 38:49.037
I'm your mother.
I know what's best for you.

38:49.121 --> 38:50.873
Can we talk about this tomorrow, please?

38:50.956 --> 38:55.002
This is exactly why I make these rules.
You're too young, too vulnerable.

38:55.085 --> 38:58.255
American boys have different values.
They don't understand respect.

38:58.297 --> 39:02.092
You get hurt. I do all of this so you
don't get hurt, and now you are hurt.

39:02.134 --> 39:05.596
I don't like this at all. Who is he?
This boy who hurt you?

39:05.679 --> 39:07.139
Henry Cho.

39:07.639 --> 39:09.266
Cho sounds Korean.

39:09.308 --> 39:10.684
- It is Korean.
- He was Korean?

39:10.767 --> 39:14.021
Yes, and he was smart
and wonderful and cute...

39:14.104 --> 39:16.815
- And you're sure he was Korean?
- He's gonna be a doctor.

39:16.899 --> 39:20.110
He goes to church.
He's a counselor at Bible camp.

39:20.444 --> 39:22.738
- And he liked me.
- A doctor!

39:22.988 --> 39:26.241
I'm so stupid.
I should have just told you and I didn't.

39:26.325 --> 39:29.161
Now he's gone, and I'm just stupid.

39:29.203 --> 39:33.373
- Maybe I can call his mother.
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.

39:38.378 --> 39:40.380
You're sure he was Korean?

39:40.589 --> 39:44.301
I swear, Mom, there's just something
about that kid that...

39:44.343 --> 39:48.222
I don't know, I hate it because he's
Luke's nephew, and Rory likes him, but...

39:48.305 --> 39:49.723
You are her mother, Lorelai.

39:49.806 --> 39:52.518
You must set boundaries
and restrictions. It's your job.

39:52.601 --> 39:55.479
I wanted to like him, but I couldn't,
and Rory can't see it.

39:55.521 --> 39:56.605
Well, she's young.

39:56.688 --> 39:58.649
- She won't take my word for it.
- She's young.

39:58.732 --> 40:00.859
I don't know what to do.
Maybe I'm overreacting.

40:00.943 --> 40:04.321
Lorelei, listen to me.
Now, I don't say this to you very often...

40:04.363 --> 40:07.658
but on this matter,
I happen to agree with you 100%.

40:08.867 --> 40:13.080
- Gee. Thanks, Mom.
- I know Rory's a good girl...

40:13.163 --> 40:17.084
but good girls can go bad with
the wrong influences. We all know that.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.837
No, I don't think Rory's
actually gonna go bad.

40:19.878 --> 40:21.505
Don't back down, Lorelai.

40:21.547 --> 40:24.341
You took a stand, and you are completely
in the right here.

40:24.383 --> 40:26.927
You absolutely must keep her
from that boy.

40:27.010 --> 40:30.514
If you need to change her curfew,
lock her up, throw away the key...

40:30.597 --> 40:33.517
whatever it takes to ensure
she doesn't go astray, you do it.

40:33.559 --> 40:37.187
Her judgment cannot be trusted here.
She's a young girl and knows nothing.

40:37.229 --> 40:41.233
You are her eyes and her ears
and her brain, for as long as it takes...

40:41.316 --> 40:45.112
to make sure she doesn't make
ridiculous choices in her life.

40:45.779 --> 40:46.864
Yeah.

40:48.198 --> 40:50.409
Would you excuse me for a sec?

40:58.083 --> 41:01.461
- Can I come in?
- It's not my house. I can't stop you.

41:01.670 --> 41:04.381
Just listen to me for one second, okay?

41:04.715 --> 41:08.135
- No sighing. Just let me talk.
- Go ahead.

41:12.598 --> 41:15.309
I don't want to lock you up
and throw away the key.

41:15.392 --> 41:16.768
Well, good.

41:16.852 --> 41:19.938
Your judgment means something,
especially to me.

41:20.272 --> 41:22.774
I can't be your eyes and your ears
and your brain.

41:22.858 --> 41:25.068
I'm trying really hard
to connect the dots here.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.570
I got spooked.

41:26.612 --> 41:29.698
It violates the fabulous 'cool-mom'
clause we're supposed to have.

41:29.781 --> 41:32.284
- But I did, and I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.995
Now, I am concerned about Jess.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.747
- You shouldn't be.
- But I am.

41:36.830 --> 41:40.042
However, you are a smart girl,
a good judge of character...

41:40.125 --> 41:44.046
and the fact that he seems to like you
gives him a couple of brownie points.

41:44.129 --> 41:47.716
You're not a little kid.
I don't think you ever were a little kid.

41:47.799 --> 41:49.760
I was, for about a month.

41:50.719 --> 41:53.680
If you think he's a decent guy,
I have to respect your judgment.

41:53.764 --> 41:55.098
Thank you.

41:55.307 --> 41:58.227
- But I'm asking you to be careful.
- I will.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.187
- Really careful.
- I will.

42:00.270 --> 42:03.398
- Boy-in-the-plastic-bubble kind of careful.
- I promise.

42:03.482 --> 42:06.985
You have to cut Dean some slack.
He's so crazy about you.

42:07.069 --> 42:09.613
He didn't mean anything
by coming to me, he just wigged.

42:09.696 --> 42:10.906
I know.

42:12.324 --> 42:14.827
- Is our fight over?
- Fight over.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.286
Good.

42:20.582 --> 42:25.003
- You still don't look okay.
- My mother agreed with me tonight.

42:25.087 --> 42:28.006
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

42:32.761 --> 42:35.013
- I need a shower.
- Don't be so dramatic.

42:35.097 --> 42:38.350
- 'I agree with you 100%.'
- Go upstairs.

42:38.475 --> 42:41.436
- Find a movie. I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.

42:41.520 --> 42:45.148
'I agree with you 100%.'
I may have to shave my head also!

43:03.876 --> 43:05.627
- Hello?
- Hi.

43:06.044 --> 43:08.005
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

43:08.630 --> 43:10.757
- Nothing. You?
- Nothing.

43:11.049 --> 43:12.176
Why'd you call?

43:12.217 --> 43:15.345
- I wanted to...
- I'm glad you called.

43:15.429 --> 43:16.722
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:16.805 --> 43:17.806
Why?

43:17.890 --> 43:21.226
'Cause maybe you could explain
what this crazy woman is talking about.

43:21.310 --> 43:23.562
- The Fountainhead.
- Yes.

43:23.604 --> 43:27.941
- Your fault. And you will pay.
- I promise, commit to it one more time...

43:28.025 --> 43:30.903
and if it still is awful for you,
I will make it up to you.

43:30.986 --> 43:33.197
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:34.114 --> 43:36.783
Okay. I'm gonna hold you to that.
