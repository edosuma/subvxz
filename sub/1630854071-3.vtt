00:01.701 --> 00:04.470
(theme music)

00:33.534 --> 00:35.868
(♪)

00:47.181 --> 00:50.482
(moss): Welcome to the new
toronto reference library

00:50.484 --> 00:53.952
And let us raise our glasses
to canada's first

00:53.954 --> 00:56.488
International convention
of novelists

00:56.590 --> 01:01.560
As we write our city a new and
glorious chapter in the arts.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.430
(applause)

01:04.531 --> 01:05.764
- Ah.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.437
Mr. Kipling?

01:12.439 --> 01:15.340
If you would be so kind
as to do me the honours, sir.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.076
I used to read my boys
"the jungle book"

01:18.079 --> 01:19.244
When they were this big.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.379
Put them to sleep every time.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.248
In a good way, of course.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.183
- Name?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.785
- Thomas brackenreid.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.653
Brackenreid: R-e-I-d.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.856
- Never heard of you.
- I'm not a writer.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.891
- This is a private party.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.527
- I'm accompanying
my good friend, the great
george crabtree.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.996
- Never heard of him, either!
- Ah! Uh...

01:38.565 --> 01:39.932
Oh, that's the chap over there.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.934
The author of two classic
novels that... Oh!

01:42.035 --> 01:44.203
The titles of which escape me
at the moment.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.003
But I assure you...

01:47.074 --> 01:48.273
Bloody hell.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.111
Oh, come here.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.482
Not the goldmine I was
hoping for.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.217
- How many autographs so far,
sir?

01:59.319 --> 02:01.286
- One. I didn't know him,
either.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.754
I mistook him
for robert service.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.224
- I'm feeling a little out
of depth myself.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.226
- Nonsense!
These are your people.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.560
Get out there, start mingling.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.028
- Sir, have you seen who's here?

02:10.030 --> 02:12.830
Henry james, edith wharton,
l. Frank baum.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.233
I'm hardly worthy.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.968
- You're an invited guest.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.936
- Yeah and, sir, look where
I am on the poster,

02:18.038 --> 02:19.371
Right there at the very bottom.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.906
(brackenreid): With
all the other up-and-comers!

02:21.007 --> 02:22.174
(crabtree): And spelled with
a "g".

02:22.176 --> 02:23.775
George grabtree.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.243
At a novelists' convention!

02:25.246 --> 02:26.844
- I am aware of the irony.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.114
- Nobody here has the faintest
idea who I am.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.383
Oh! Until now, that is.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.584
(brackenreid): Who's that?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.852
(crabtree): Lucy maud
montgomery.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.386
- The writer of
"anne of green gardens"?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.855
- Gables.
- Oh. You know her?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.191
- Oh, yes, sir.
We became well acquainted.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.859
I inspired her main character.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.460
- A little girl called anne?

02:42.462 --> 02:45.464
- Sir, an orphan,
found in a carpet bag,

02:45.566 --> 02:46.999
Wildly imaginative.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.601
That must be her fiancé
she's with.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.769
I heard she became engaged.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.572
But I have no doubt, sir,
she'll thank me. Just watch.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.981
- For your troubles.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.754
- You must've made quite
the impression.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.889
Right, that's me for the night.
I'm off.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.457
- Well, if you're leaving,
so am I.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.559
Anyway, how much fun
could we possibly miss?

03:14.562 --> 03:17.229
- Right. The tipsy ferret
it is, then.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.097
- Thank you.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.503
(♪)

03:27.841 --> 03:29.574
(scream)

03:29.576 --> 03:31.310
(dramatic music)

03:37.651 --> 03:39.784
- Oh. What have we here?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.586
- Sir, alfred pope.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.122
One of the writers at
the opening cocktail party
last night.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.792
- That's the man I mistook for
robert service.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.594
We should have stuck around
longer.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.196
- You spoke with this man?

03:52.199 --> 03:53.532
- Around 9:30.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.334
He seemed well enough
at the time.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.736
I must've gotten
his final signature.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.571
Do you think that ups the value?

04:02.276 --> 04:04.809
(sighs)
- what have you, mrs. Hart?

04:04.911 --> 04:07.279
- It looks like his heart's been
penetrated by a single jab.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.681
He's been dead a few hours
at least.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.017
- Who found the body?
- Ah, the cleaner, sir.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.217
She found him this morning.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.821
- Apparently the revelry went on
until the early hours.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.959
(hart): Someone was sending
a message.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.027
(murdoch): Indeed.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.629
Pages from a book.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.998
- Sir, I found several books
scattered about the room,

04:27.001 --> 04:28.600
But none of them were missing
any pages.

04:29.803 --> 04:33.538
- Seems to be some writing
on one side, as well.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.741
Red ink, perhaps?

04:35.743 --> 04:38.243
- Not a wise choice if you want
someone to read it.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.379
- Right. George,
once mrs. Hart is finished

04:41.481 --> 04:43.881
With the murder weapon
and the accompanying pages,

04:43.884 --> 04:45.550
Please bring them to my office.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.519
We also need to speak with
all of the guests

04:47.621 --> 04:50.055
In order to retrace
mr. Pope's final steps.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.823
(brackenreid): I'm on it.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.198
- Excuse me, constable.
- Oh, lord!

05:00.200 --> 05:03.000
- Would you have any idea why
the convention's been postponed?

05:03.003 --> 05:04.936
- I'm afraid there's been
a murder.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.139
- Oh my lord! Who?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.473
- Well, we'll make
an announcement

05:08.575 --> 05:11.009
Once we notify
the next of kin.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.878
- To think that I was trying
to sneak in here last night.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.748
I was hoping to slip one of them
my stories.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.817
- Last night you say?

05:18.819 --> 05:19.918
When?

05:20.487 --> 05:21.820
- Around 10.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.489
- And were you able to get in?
Were there any doors unlocked?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.492
- Ah, they...They were sealed
tight, I'm afraid.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.094
I even tried the windows.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.829
- Well, did you notice anything
unusual?

05:30.930 --> 05:34.132
Anybody lurking about besides
yourself, I suppose?

05:34.734 --> 05:36.101
- I'm afraid not.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.770
- Right, well if you remember
anything, anything at all,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.305
I would appreciate
you letting me know.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.041
I'm constable george crabtree.
I'm at station house four.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.910
- George crabtree, the writer?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.645
- Yes, that's right.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.781
Do I know you?
- No! But I know you.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.384
"curse of the pharaohs",
"a man alone."

05:52.386 --> 05:54.653
I'm a huge fan, sir.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.921
Your words are salve
to the soul.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.456
- Well, I don't know about that.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.393
- I'm norman bean. I fancy
myself a bit of a writer, too.

06:01.494 --> 06:02.727
- Oh, is that right?

06:02.729 --> 06:05.196
- I'm very excited to be
in your presence.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.799
I can't help but think that
this is fate.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.668
Would you allow me
to follow you around for a day?

06:11.271 --> 06:12.938
I could help out,
if you'd like.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.607
I'd love to delve into the brain
of george crabtree.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.843
- Really?

06:29.356 --> 06:31.923
- I beg your pardon.
Is this seat taken?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.727
- Uh, I suppose not.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.231
(sighs)

06:40.234 --> 06:42.634
(baby crying)
- I suppose everyone turned away

06:42.735 --> 06:45.570
From the novelists' convention
ended up here.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.038
- Indeed.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.507
I heard there may have been
a murder.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.709
- Ah, it's true, I'm afraid.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.645
My husband's a detective
on the case.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.780
- A macabre profession,
to be sure.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.382
(chuckles)
- I used to be a city coroner.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.784
That's where we met.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.719
- Oh, how ghastly!

07:02.355 --> 07:05.123
And yet perversely fascinating.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.391
Do you miss it?

07:06.493 --> 07:08.993
- Uh, I'd be lying if I said
I didn't,

07:08.996 --> 07:13.264
But life had
greater adventures in store.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.800
- I suppose so.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.871
- I didn't quit because
of my child,

07:19.973 --> 07:21.138
If that's what you're implying.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.610
- Half the trouble in life
is caused by pretending there
isn't any.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.180
- Well,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.615
I'll have you know,

07:30.717 --> 07:33.284
I'm still very active in
the medical field.

07:33.920 --> 07:38.089
Edith wharton would not
appreciate you twisting
her words like that.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.358
- Forgive me.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.061
I have a nasty habit
of overstepping.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.966
- I guess we have that
in common.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.869
- Perhaps my name might help
excuse the blunder.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.438
I'm edith wharton.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.307
- Oh, my.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.441
You are.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.578
- My lecture's been postponed.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.981
Any suggestions on what
one might do to while away

08:02.983 --> 08:04.516
A few hours in this town?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.084
- Oh!

08:07.954 --> 08:09.587
- Mr. Kipling?

08:09.690 --> 08:10.655
Remember me?

08:14.194 --> 08:16.194
I'm on police business
this time.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.565
Are you familiar
with an alfred pope?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.802
- Uh, I heard. Terrible.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.738
- And I heard that you were
one of the last people

08:26.839 --> 08:27.805
To leave the party.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.141
Did you exchange words with him,
by any chance?

08:30.143 --> 08:34.079
- I'll tell you what I know, but
you'll have to buy me a drink.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.549
Although, I doubt very much
you'd be familiar with it.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.284
- Try me.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.219
- A pisco sour.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.022
- Pisco: Lime juice,
simple syrup,

08:44.124 --> 08:46.291
Egg whites, angostura bitters.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.492
- Impressive.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.228
But did you also know that
it was a favourite

08:50.230 --> 08:53.999
Of that anti-imperialist
bastard, mark twain?

08:54.601 --> 08:56.568
May he rest in peace.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.370
- Who do you think
I got the recipe from?

08:58.471 --> 09:00.272
Join me for a tipple.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.142
(soft music)

09:06.046 --> 09:09.080
- Sir, any luck isolating
the red ink?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.449
- Not much, I'm afraid.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.251
I've tried a number of different
light settings,

09:13.353 --> 09:16.321
Including ultraviolet,
but nothing seems to be working.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.123
- I wonder if there's a way
to remove the blood chemically?

09:19.126 --> 09:20.992
- Precisely what I was thinking.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.595
However, I will need you
to transcribe the text

09:23.697 --> 09:26.264
From these pages so we can still
identify the book

09:26.366 --> 09:28.266
Should the process compromise
the ink.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.068
- I assumed as much.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.003
I took the liberty while
you were with the inspector.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.471
- Oh!

09:33.573 --> 09:37.141
Well, then I need you to track
down alfred pope's wife,

09:37.144 --> 09:38.810
Let her know I need to speak
with her.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.279
- Sir, done so and
she's available this afternoon.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.215
- Well, very good.
Very good.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.485
Then, perhaps you and
the inspector should create
a timeline

09:47.587 --> 09:50.622
Of alfred pope's final
interactions.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.326
Uh, well...

09:54.828 --> 09:57.862
George, your efficiency
is noted.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.564
How did you find the time?

10:00.567 --> 10:03.735
- Tea is ready, sir.
- Ah! Norman.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.440
- Needs one more sugar.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.177
- Very good, sir.
- I've taken an assistant.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.348
- I'll take mrs. Pope's
address now, please.
- Right. Right.

10:18.551 --> 10:22.053
- For 300 miles in 20 days,
we pushed through sandstorms

10:22.055 --> 10:24.321
And searing heat,
our rations waning,

10:24.324 --> 10:27.525
Only to emerge at kandahar
in time to blow ayub khan

10:27.627 --> 10:30.795
And his cowardly lancers back
to the stone age!

10:30.897 --> 10:33.298
(laughter)

10:33.300 --> 10:35.399
- "take up the white man's
burden,

10:35.402 --> 10:37.936
Send forth the best ye breed,

10:37.938 --> 10:41.139
Bind your sons to exile,

10:41.241 --> 10:44.008
To serve thy captives' need!"

10:44.011 --> 10:45.910
(laughter)

10:46.246 --> 10:47.679
- I must say,

10:47.781 --> 10:49.681
It's a pleasure to drink with
a son of the empire.

10:49.683 --> 10:53.818
- Uh, well, I do appreciate
your respect

10:53.920 --> 10:55.553
For law and order.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.555
And I will keep an ear open.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.493
Whoever took down pope
must be apprehended.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.295
No one ever said
a bad word about him,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.531
May god rest his soul.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.566
Ah...

11:10.070 --> 11:12.103
So, you've brought your book
again.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.172
- Ah, pretend you didn't see it.

11:14.274 --> 11:19.444
- Well, what if I pretended
I did see it and I signed it?

11:19.545 --> 11:22.180
That's what you want, isn't it?

11:22.182 --> 11:25.116
- You'd consider it?
- I'll do you one better.

11:26.152 --> 11:31.122
I am winnowing a series
of essays on sea warfare

11:31.124 --> 11:34.592
For an upcoming collection
and I could use

11:34.594 --> 11:38.596
The advice of a war veteran
such as yourself.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.331
(chuckling)

11:40.433 --> 11:42.600
- I would be honoured,
mr. Kipling.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.936
- Call me rudyard.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.838
- Rudyard.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.945
- I still can't believe
alfred is dead.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.948
We just booked a trip
to hawaii.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.618
He'd boast of visits to kilauea
in his books,

12:00.620 --> 12:02.687
But he never actually went.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.756
It was our little secret.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.691
Now he'll never go.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.695
- When did you last see
your husband?

12:10.797 --> 12:12.931
- We went to the cocktail party
together.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.435
I felt a little out of place,
so I left around 11.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.171
He offered to take me home,

12:20.273 --> 12:25.376
But I insisted that he stay
and enjoy himself.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.913
- Did you notice anything
unusual?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.183
Any tension with one
of the writers, perhaps?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.785
- No, of course not.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.654
When I left he was telling
a joke.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.126
The last thing I heard
was his stupid laugh.

12:41.227 --> 12:44.929
- Do you know of anyone who may
have wished your husband harm?

12:45.031 --> 12:47.531
- Alfred was respected
by his peers.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.133
His books didn't sell well,

12:49.135 --> 12:51.002
So he wasn't in competition
with anyone.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.439
It doesn't make any sense.

12:56.442 --> 13:02.046
- We... We found pages affixed
to your husband's body.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.716
We've transcribed them.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.019
Do you recognize any
of this text?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.426
- They're from his upcoming
book, "killian's folly."

13:16.128 --> 13:18.429
He'd just been sent a box
of advance copies,

13:18.531 --> 13:20.498
But as far as I know,
it's unopened.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.268
(sobbing)

13:25.305 --> 13:28.773
- It's a thinly veiled assault
on the literary community.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.642
What's more, three of the books
were missing from a box.

13:31.645 --> 13:35.045
He likely distributed them
to his fellow novelists.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.515
- And you think if we find them,
we may find our culprit?

13:37.617 --> 13:40.051
- Possibly. It also means
that everyone,

13:40.152 --> 13:41.786
Including kipling,
is a suspect.

13:41.788 --> 13:45.189
- Not to mention a skinflint.
He stiffed me on the bill.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.325
Are you sure we're not
overthinking this?

13:47.427 --> 13:50.395
- Sir, the book lampoons
the literary community.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.464
It creates caricatures out
of a number of famed authors,

13:53.466 --> 13:54.932
Or so george tells me.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.135
- There's no such thing
as bad press.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.402
(knocking)

13:58.405 --> 14:00.538
- Mrs. Hart. You have news?
- Ah, yes.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.206
I've completed the post-mortem

14:02.209 --> 14:04.408
And I have a smaller timeframe
for pope's time of death.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.744
He died between midnight
and 2:00 am.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.679
- Well, that makes sense.
We've established

14:08.781 --> 14:10.415
That the party continued
past midnight.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.483
- Yet, all the writers
that I checked with,

14:12.485 --> 14:14.953
Including kipling, lucy maud
and edith wharton,

14:14.955 --> 14:17.288
All say they left the party
well before midnight.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.691
- And none of them recall
interacting with pope,

14:19.792 --> 14:22.226
Which I find odd.
Anything else?

14:22.228 --> 14:25.562
- Actually, yes.
I examined the brown liquid
on the victim's shirt

14:25.565 --> 14:28.433
And I found sugars mixed
with some type of alcohol.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.435
- Someone must've spilt a drink
on him before doing him in.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.971
- That wasn't the only
odd finding.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.639
There was also a crusty
substance,

14:34.740 --> 14:36.707
Which proved to be the proteins
of egg white.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.644
Who would put an egg white
in a drink?

14:39.746 --> 14:42.647
- Bloody hell. A pisco sour.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.315
- Meaning what, exactly?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.384
- Meaning I need to go
and visit a friend.

14:46.485 --> 14:47.986
(♪)

14:52.325 --> 14:54.858
As I told old tommy boy,

14:55.228 --> 14:58.329
I was nowhere near pope
that night.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.667
- Then how do you explain
the traces of pisco sour
on his shirt?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.073
(grunts)

15:10.744 --> 15:14.812
- Right. So, he and I had
a bit of a row.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.349
He called my writing
"jingoistic claptrap."

15:18.351 --> 15:20.618
And I responded accordingly.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.688
- What time did you last
see him?

15:23.790 --> 15:27.058
- North of midnight
the events began to blur.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.828
- So, it's possible you were
with him

15:30.830 --> 15:32.429
At the time he was murdered?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.498
- If you're implying
what I think you're implying,

15:34.501 --> 15:36.200
I'd tread lightly.

15:36.302 --> 15:39.437
- You lied about your perception
of the victim,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.839
You lied about
when you last saw him,

15:41.841 --> 15:43.040
And you lied about
your argument.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.110
You seem to have a problem
with facts, mr. Kipling.

15:46.212 --> 15:51.115
- The facts are alfred pope
resented my success

15:51.117 --> 15:54.519
And he was a self-entitled
chowderhead.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.921
He deserved a pisco sour
on his shirt.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.457
He did not deserve to die.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.325
I did not kill him

16:01.327 --> 16:03.728
And he was alive when
I left him.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.463
- All right.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.500
Can you at least tell me
who was with him at that time?

16:10.036 --> 16:12.403
- Yes, I can, in fact.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.340
He was in the rare book room
getting forward

16:16.442 --> 16:19.477
With a certain
lucy maud montgomery.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.414
(intriguing music)

16:29.756 --> 16:31.489
- Sir. Any luck?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.589
(sighs)

16:32.592 --> 16:35.492
- The blood and the ink have
somehow fused.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.696
No matter how I adjust my
hydrogen peroxide chemical bath,

16:38.698 --> 16:41.699
I can't seem to remove one
without removing the other.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.901
Might be quite effective for
cleaning a stain, though, sir.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.171
Uh, you asked for me.
- Yes.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.975
Lucy maud montgomery
has been placed alone

16:50.977 --> 16:52.710
At the scene with the victim.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.979
I need you to bring her in.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.052
Is that a problem, george?
- Sir, no.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.258
- Three sugars this time.
- Ah, norman.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.061
Thank you. I owe you.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.363
- It's... It's funny
you say that.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.800
My... My story. I was hoping
that you could read it.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.136
Um, if... When you're not
so busy.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.537
- Uh, yes. Yes, of course.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.875
Um, I've got some police duty
to attend to right now,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.543
But I'll give this a read
as soon as possible.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.178
- Thank you, sir.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.784
(♪)

17:40.493 --> 17:42.293
- Lucy maud montgomery.

17:44.797 --> 17:45.797
- Oh.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.999
The coat check boy.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.634
- Still?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.237
You really don't
remember me?

17:53.239 --> 17:57.108
You took my class.
We had a moment?

17:58.277 --> 18:01.345
- I'm sorry. You must have me
mistaken for someone else.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.814
Now, if you'll excuse me.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.417
- Well, actually,
miss montgomery.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.654
This is not a social call.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.557
- Oh.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.194
(murdoch): What were you and
mr. Pope discussing

18:17.197 --> 18:18.395
In the rare book room?

18:18.398 --> 18:21.532
- Nothing. I helped him
dry his shirt, that's all.

18:22.368 --> 18:26.537
- Mr. Kipling intimated
that he may have been getting
forward with you.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.273
- You can't possibly be taking
anything mr. Kipling...

18:31.077 --> 18:33.143
Mr. Kipling is wrong.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.546
Alfred and I were friends,
nothing more.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.181
Then why did you lie?

18:37.283 --> 18:40.351
- I was afraid my fiancé
would get the same idea as
mr. Kipling.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.487
- What did the two of you
talk about?

18:43.489 --> 18:46.157
- Nothing coherent, anyway.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.758
He was more than a little drunk.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.762
Did he imply that he was
under any sort of threat?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.164
- No.

18:53.566 --> 18:58.302
Alfred could be abrasive,
but he was very well respected.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.640
In truth, he was the writer
we all aspired to be.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.042
He lived like a poet,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.644
Died like a poet.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.248
He couldn't have conceived of
a more delicious ending

19:11.251 --> 19:12.917
If he wrote it himself.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.387
- It was hardly a delicious
ending. He was murdered.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.723
And you were one of the last
people to see him alive.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.392
- I... I swear to you,
detective,

19:21.493 --> 19:23.628
There was nothing odd about him
when I left.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.332
- Can you at least tell me
who else may have been there?

19:28.434 --> 19:29.867
(sighs)

19:30.503 --> 19:32.203
- It's all a little blurry.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.672
But I believe edith wharton
was still there.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.281
- Ah. No hard feelings, rudyard?

19:45.318 --> 19:48.152
- You were just doing your job.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.954
- How's your book?

19:50.055 --> 19:52.089
The essays you were gathering
on sea warfare?

19:52.191 --> 19:56.026
- Excellent. Uh, I think
I came up with an opener.

19:56.029 --> 19:59.830
It came to me shortly
after I was brought in
for questioning.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.898
- Oh, is that right?
- Hm. Yeah.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.101
Could I see that book of yours?

20:04.103 --> 20:06.670
I'd just like to jot it down.
- Of course.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.438
- Thank you.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.975
Ah, ooh.

20:11.076 --> 20:12.143
Ah!

20:12.979 --> 20:14.845
Yes, yes.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.982
It went a little something
like...

20:17.984 --> 20:19.550
This.

20:24.523 --> 20:25.890
(♪)

20:28.528 --> 20:29.694
Hm.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.164
Now we've never met.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.399
Ha.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.767
Ah!

20:38.103 --> 20:39.203
No hard feelings.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.409
- So, edith wharton was there?

20:45.411 --> 20:47.878
- Although it is possible
miss montgomery's memory

20:47.980 --> 20:49.547
Of the evening was...
Compromised.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.683
- Sir, that is a phenomenon
I have experienced personally.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.486
- And inspector brackenreid says
ms. Wharton claims

20:55.488 --> 20:56.821
To have been at her hotel.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.290
- Yes, I confirmed
as much with the concierge
at the empress.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.992
- Sirs? That's false.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.061
- What's false?

21:05.098 --> 21:07.765
- I'm embarrassed
to admit that

21:07.866 --> 21:11.102
After failing to break into
the cocktail party,

21:11.203 --> 21:14.772
I heard that edith wharton was
staying at the empress.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.709
So, I tipped a bellman to...

21:19.012 --> 21:20.711
To slip her my manuscript.

21:21.281 --> 21:25.116
- Well, it's possible
she pretended not to receive it.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.519
- Perhaps, but... But the
bellman insisted that... That

21:28.521 --> 21:30.054
Not only was she not there,

21:30.156 --> 21:32.456
But that she had never
been there.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.560
I... I knocked on her door
myself.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.197
- So, if she said she left
that party

21:40.299 --> 21:42.199
And went straight to her
hotel room...

21:42.201 --> 21:44.368
- Then edith wharton is lying.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.972
(birds chirping)

21:49.475 --> 21:52.476
- Hmm. I would love to go back
to France.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.945
It's been far too long.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.481
- I don't know why anyone lives
in america at all.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.884
It's... It's all right to visit,

21:59.886 --> 22:01.485
But it's not exactly europe,
is it?

22:01.587 --> 22:02.753
- Mm.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.855
(door closing)

22:05.591 --> 22:06.490
William!

22:06.592 --> 22:07.892
(squeals)

22:08.628 --> 22:10.026
(chuckles)
come!

22:10.029 --> 22:12.229
My friend and I got
into the wine.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.098
(chuckling)
- I can see that.

22:14.199 --> 22:16.267
- You won't believe who it is.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.768
She's very eager to meet you.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.370
- That's why I'm here.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.038
You left me a message at
the station house.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.106
- Oh... Oh.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.306
(chuckles)
- charmed.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.643
Julia has told me a great deal
about you.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.613
- Did she also tell you
that I need to bring you in
for questioning?

22:30.115 --> 22:31.015
- What?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.084
William, what are you saying?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.320
You're embarrassing me in front
of my friend.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.589
- She may be your friend.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.125
But she's also a suspect
for murder.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.094
(♪)

22:49.569 --> 22:52.469
What were you doing
between midnight and 2:00 am
last night?

22:52.772 --> 22:54.438
- I was sleeping.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.208
- Where?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.675
- In my hotel.

22:59.244 --> 23:02.813
- Hm. We've confirmed with
the hotel bellman

23:02.915 --> 23:04.882
That you never returned
last night.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.317
So, where were you really?

23:08.087 --> 23:10.220
(brackenreid): You can fix this,
mrs. Wharton.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.189
Just tell us where you were.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.094
- I prefer to speak with
my attorney.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.462
(brackenreid): Fine.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.830
In the meantime,

23:19.932 --> 23:22.133
We have a lovely spot for you
to sit and wait.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.837
- You've thrown edith wharton
in jail?

23:26.839 --> 23:29.173
- We're giving her a chance
to cool off.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.275
Maybe she'll decide to say
something of substance.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.909
- And you agreed to this?

23:33.479 --> 23:35.846
- She lied about her alibi.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.648
- Well, perhaps
she had a good reason?

23:37.749 --> 23:39.950
- She was the last person seen
in the company

23:39.952 --> 23:41.051
Of a murder victim.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.787
- Well, by a woman who was
impaired.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.191
- She refuses to answer
any of our questions.

23:47.292 --> 23:48.525
What are we supposed to do?

23:48.627 --> 23:50.060
- She's as stubborn as a mule!

23:50.162 --> 23:51.328
We're doing all we can.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.365
- Well, not quite.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.837
(♪)

24:03.042 --> 24:06.076
Not exactly your country house
in lennox.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.820
Edith, I want you to know that
whatever you say to me

24:16.922 --> 24:19.089
Will remain between us.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.558
- How can I trust you?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.394
You're basically part
of the constabulary.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.097
- I'm a woman.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.367
And, even though we just met,
I hope a friend.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.770
You lied about where you were.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.305
That's an unusual decision.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.841
This is a very serious
murder investigation.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.810
- I didn't have a choice.

24:41.079 --> 24:42.980
- Well, please,
help me understand.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.149
- I love my husband
very much.

24:46.886 --> 24:51.288
Teddy was once a joyous soul
but is no longer.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.792
- Marriage can be complicated.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.394
- Mine especially, I'm afraid.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.597
Teddy suffers from melancholia.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.900
Living with him
is no longer viable.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.704
I needed an outlet.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.606
- So, you had an affair.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.611
- His name is morton fullerton

25:14.614 --> 25:17.214
And he's the foreign
correspondent
for the<i> times of london.</i>

25:17.750 --> 25:20.817
Which is to say that he has
the means to travel discreetly.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.987
It's an open secret,

25:23.722 --> 25:25.622
Emphasis on the word "secret".

25:25.725 --> 25:27.291
- So, you fear
the repercussions.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.360
- Hm. The vultures
want their carrion, julia.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.031
Such is the cost of excelling
in a man's field.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.634
- This reminds me of a quote
I read recently

25:37.737 --> 25:39.537
In a magazine excerpt.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.372
"that life is just a
perpetual..."

25:42.474 --> 25:44.908
(together): "piecing together
of broken bits."

25:45.144 --> 25:47.243
(chuckles)
- indeed.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.981
Apparently,
I have far too many of them.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.217
- Tell me where your friend
is staying

25:54.319 --> 25:56.287
And I promise to keep
your secret.

25:59.024 --> 26:02.226
William? Any progress?

26:02.628 --> 26:04.194
- Not much.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.730
I've managed to corrupt
two pages

26:06.832 --> 26:09.633
And I'm down to my last
piece of evidence.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.669
No matter the formula, I can't
seem to extract enough blood

26:12.771 --> 26:14.672
To reveal the red ink below.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.340
- That sounds like
quite the undertaking.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.341
(sighs)

26:17.442 --> 26:18.942
- It's like changing the tint
of the ocean

26:19.044 --> 26:20.276
To see the fish.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.413
- Why not change the fish?

26:24.783 --> 26:26.050
- Focus on the ink.

26:27.653 --> 26:30.754
The peroxide bond is indeed
weak and unstable.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.356
- By switching
the h2o2 with 3h60,

26:33.359 --> 26:35.692
You could let the acetone work
on the message itself

26:35.695 --> 26:37.227
With minimal damage.

26:37.997 --> 26:41.498
- Julia ogden,
I have never loved you more!

26:43.669 --> 26:47.771
- Well, perhaps this is a very
good time to ask for a favour.

26:47.773 --> 26:48.906
- Anything.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.108
- Release edith wharton.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.110
- Except that.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.446
- William, she had her reasons
to withhold her alibi.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.450
She won't tell you and
she won't tell the inspector,

26:59.551 --> 27:01.585
But she did tell me and...

27:01.687 --> 27:04.188
I confirmed her claims
are legitimate.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.724
- I can't just take your word
for it.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.993
- Well, I understand.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.661
But know this:

27:10.663 --> 27:12.529
If you continue to view her
as a suspect,

27:12.631 --> 27:13.897
You're wasting your time.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.437
(♪)

27:51.069 --> 27:53.937
(intriguing music)

28:35.614 --> 28:37.548
- Sir?
- Perfect timing, george.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.417
I think I've discovered a way
to read the hidden ink message.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.885
- But we may not need it, sir.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.220
I think I know
who the killer is.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.954
Look at this.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.090
Liquor, lime
and a trace of egg white.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.058
Sniff!

28:48.860 --> 28:50.027
Oh, wait!

28:53.331 --> 28:54.030
(scoffs)

28:54.132 --> 28:55.298
(together): Pisco sour.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.400
- Sir, this must've been what
pope was holding

28:57.502 --> 28:59.102
When kipling
threw the drink on him.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.037
- That would explain
the strange powder

29:01.040 --> 29:02.773
Mrs. Hart mentioned.

29:02.874 --> 29:05.375
George, where did you get this?

29:05.377 --> 29:07.878
- Sir, my number one fan:

29:07.980 --> 29:09.312
Norman bean.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.115
(♪)

29:15.888 --> 29:17.988
- I met alfred pope before
the party.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.291
He was the only one that
would talk to me.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.662
I managed to slip him my story.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.664
He said that he would read it
right away.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.501
The anticipation was killing me.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.271
- So, you weren't sneaking
into that party

29:34.273 --> 29:35.806
To give out your story.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.208
You were trying to get it back.

29:39.044 --> 29:41.345
- I wanted to see his thoughts,
sir.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.481
- You expected a response
that quickly?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.417
- It's a really good story.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.688
- At any rate,

29:51.690 --> 29:54.424
You lied about not being able
to get into the party.

29:54.727 --> 29:56.593
- Not entirely.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.596
The back exit was indeed
locked at 10.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.966
But I neglected to add that

30:03.068 --> 30:06.102
I had come back once more to see
that it was open.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.438
- What time was this?
- Around 1:30.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.507
Somebody had opened
the deadbolt

30:10.609 --> 30:14.011
And kept the door ajar
to prevent it from locking.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.246
I couldn't believe my luck.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.447
- What did you do then?

30:17.549 --> 30:19.749
- I was elated to find that

30:19.851 --> 30:21.919
Not only was alfred there,

30:22.788 --> 30:25.422
But that he was alone.

30:26.725 --> 30:29.993
So I mustered up the courage
to...

30:31.130 --> 30:33.063
Ask him what he thought about
my story.

30:35.567 --> 30:36.600
- He didn't like it.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.335
- He read it aloud,

30:39.972 --> 30:42.405
Laughing at
all the serious parts,

30:42.507 --> 30:47.344
Mocking my superhuman zantar
character,

30:47.346 --> 30:50.247
Who I was dumb enough to think
was destined for greatness.

30:51.416 --> 30:52.749
- So, you killed him.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.617
- No.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.020
- You were hurt, humiliated.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.890
It would have been
understandable under
the circumstances.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.626
- I didn't kill him!
- What did you do, then?

31:02.727 --> 31:05.829
- I wanted so much to just
give him a piece of my mind!

31:07.166 --> 31:08.966
But I just snatched
my story back

31:09.067 --> 31:10.800
And went out the same door
that I came in.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.436
- That's it?
- Yeah.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.907
- You expect me to believe
that you broke into the party,

31:16.909 --> 31:18.709
Found the victim alone,

31:18.711 --> 31:21.110
Had a humiliating altercation
with him

31:21.113 --> 31:22.512
And then simply left,

31:22.514 --> 31:24.981
Without a single guest
as a witness?

31:25.083 --> 31:26.516
- I know it seems a little
far-fetched,

31:26.618 --> 31:28.185
But that's exactly
what happened.

31:31.756 --> 31:35.058
- Allow me to counter with
an alternate story,

31:35.160 --> 31:39.896
One where a man ingratiated
himself with my best constable

31:39.899 --> 31:42.199
In order to get close
to a case

31:42.201 --> 31:45.602
Because he had murdered a man
out of fury and shame.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.271
- No.
- I'm sorry, mr. Bean,

31:48.274 --> 31:50.407
But the evidence strongly
suggests

31:50.409 --> 31:51.942
That you are guilty
of murder.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.477
(brackenreid): Well,
we finally got our man.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.279
He was playing you all along,
bugalugs.

31:56.381 --> 31:58.415
- Sir, I feel quite the fool.

31:58.516 --> 32:01.685
There was absolutely nothing
murderous I saw in norman bean.

32:02.187 --> 32:05.088
- Flattery is a powerful tool
in the devil's arsenal.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.491
(crabtree): Somewhat ironic,
isn't it, sirs?

32:08.494 --> 32:11.762
Alfred pope's death will surely
cause a surge in his book sales.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.965
- Mm. Mr. Pope will finally
achieve the success

32:14.967 --> 32:16.466
That has thus far eluded him.

32:18.003 --> 32:20.570
- Perhaps not so ironic
after all.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.511
"aloha..."

32:28.213 --> 32:31.715
(crabtree):
"aloha,<i> meine schnecke</i> "?

32:32.251 --> 32:33.684
- What the bloody hell
does that mean?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.521
<i> - We had just booked a trip</i>
<i> to hawaii.</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:39.856
<i> - Couldn't have conceived of</i>
<i> a more delicious ending</i>

32:39.958 --> 32:41.791
<i> If he wrote it himself.</i>

32:41.794 --> 32:43.627
(♪)

32:57.108 --> 32:58.941
- It means mr. Pope
went to extreme measures

32:58.944 --> 33:00.410
To cement his legacy.

33:00.946 --> 33:02.145
(sighs)

33:02.247 --> 33:04.114
- "aloha,<i> meine schnecke</i> ."

33:06.151 --> 33:09.252
- Both hello and goodbye,
as I understand it.

33:10.288 --> 33:13.490
He was making apparent
his suicide to you

33:13.492 --> 33:16.259
And to the world in order
to generate sales.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.695
- But alfred never cared
about sales.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.497
It doesn't make any sense!

33:21.133 --> 33:23.433
- Well, perhaps it was just
to you?

33:23.836 --> 33:25.502
Uh, "<i> meine schnecke</i> ."

33:26.972 --> 33:28.739
- His pet name for me.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.608
The german word for "slug".

33:32.778 --> 33:34.911
He knew how much I hated
that word.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.913
He used to tease me with it
all the time.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.448
It always made me laugh.

33:39.985 --> 33:42.119
Somehow it's not working
this time.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.524
- Your husband found the most
succinct way possible

33:47.526 --> 33:49.292
To tell you that he loved you.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.428
- Did he not understand that

33:52.431 --> 33:54.798
I would rather we be free
together?

33:58.871 --> 34:02.339
- Thank you for
your husband's work-in-progress.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.742
I can see by the notes
in the margins

34:05.844 --> 34:08.211
That they match
his handwritten notes.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.113
- He was always editing
in the margins

34:10.215 --> 34:12.049
With his stupid red pen.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.886
- I'm terribly sorry,
mrs. Pope.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.322
I do hope that you can find
some peace.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.260
- I'm not sure I know how
without alfred.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.130
(soft music)

34:29.501 --> 34:30.834
(sobbing)

34:32.104 --> 34:34.704
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.107
It's nice having a bill paid
for a change,

34:37.209 --> 34:38.508
Unlike some people.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.979
- Ah! There you are.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.748
- Thanks.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.053
- "if you can talk with crowds
and keep your virtue,

34:50.155 --> 34:53.389
Or walk with kings nor lose
the common touch,

34:53.391 --> 34:55.791
If neither foes nor
loving friends can hurt you,

34:55.794 --> 34:57.894
If all men count with you,
but none too much.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.597
If you can fill
the unforgiving minute,

35:00.699 --> 35:02.999
With 60 seconds' worth
of distance run,

35:03.101 --> 35:05.468
Yours is the earth
and everything that's in it,

35:05.570 --> 35:08.672
And which is more,
you'll be a man, my son!"

35:13.745 --> 35:15.545
- Truer words were never spoken,

35:15.547 --> 35:18.482
If I may say so myself.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.283
- I don't disagree.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.219
I think it's one of
your most brilliant pieces.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.020
- And hot off the presses, too.

35:24.923 --> 35:29.559
If by committing my new poem,
if, to memory

35:29.561 --> 35:33.897
You are trying to grovel back
an autograph,

35:33.999 --> 35:35.231
It's working.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.366
- I don't grovel.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.101
I'm here to tell you

35:38.103 --> 35:40.303
That the man of virtue described
in your poem

35:40.305 --> 35:42.706
Is not the man that sits
before me.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.308
And I'd sooner
have the bartender's autograph
than yours.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.210
Oh, and, uh,

35:47.312 --> 35:49.579
I picked up your tab
so you don't stiff him again.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.282
Men of virtue
pay their bills, sir.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.721
(indistinct chatter)

35:59.691 --> 36:01.124
(crabtree): Son of a gun!

36:01.526 --> 36:02.726
It works.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.295
- I cannot believe it.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.396
(sighs)

36:07.365 --> 36:09.266
So, it was a suicide
all along?

36:09.367 --> 36:12.869
- Yes. The answer was right
under our noses the whole time.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.606
- This was a plot development
I never saw coming,

36:17.508 --> 36:20.043
Which just goes to show you
I'm not much of a copper.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.478
Or a writer, for that matter.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.481
- Now, on that matter,
I'm not so sure.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.683
I read your story, norman.

36:27.686 --> 36:31.287
It's so full of action and heart
and valour.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.690
I found it nothing short
of remarkable.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.425
- Are you having me on?

36:35.526 --> 36:38.194
- Not at all. I wouldn't change
a single word.

36:38.931 --> 36:41.364
I do think you should
try a pseudonym, however.

36:41.466 --> 36:44.367
Something a little snappier
than norman bean.

36:44.469 --> 36:47.103
- Norman bean is a pseudonym,
sir.

36:48.473 --> 36:50.840
I didn't want to risk
embarrassing my family

36:50.842 --> 36:52.309
In case my book was a failure.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.944
- Well, what's your real name?

36:54.513 --> 36:55.511
- Burroughs.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.247
My name's ed burroughs.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.982
- Ed burroughs. That's not bad.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.717
It could use a little
souping up.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.986
- My proper name
is edgar rice burroughs.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.321
- I would go with that.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.924
That has some
real gravitas to it.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.794
I also think you should consider
changing the name of your hero.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.597
Zantar sounds a bit like
a magician.

37:14.699 --> 37:17.800
- I also considered tublat zan.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.470
- That sounds too much like
a creature from outer space.

37:21.473 --> 37:25.141
It's not quite right for
a superhuman man-ape character.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.676
- What would you call him?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.210
- Well, I would reverse it.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.813
- Uh, ape-man?

37:29.914 --> 37:32.549
- No, I mean zantar.
I would reverse that.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.352
- Tarzan.
- Yes!

37:35.354 --> 37:39.488
Actually, I was thinking zartan,
but tarzan could work.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.224
- Tarzan, the ape man.

37:41.326 --> 37:42.959
(chuckling)
- there we go.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.494
Here, let me buy you a pint.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.995
I owe you that much, at least.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.164
- I finally get to draw on
your wisdom?

37:48.400 --> 37:50.867
- I have a feeling
I'll be drawing on yours, sir.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.070
(brackenreid): Murdoch.
A moment.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.842
If you've got any of
your adhesive thing-a-majiggy

37:59.845 --> 38:02.579
And could stick this lot
back together...

38:06.718 --> 38:08.251
It's a lost cause, isn't it?

38:09.321 --> 38:11.421
- I'm afraid so.
- Mm.

38:14.359 --> 38:17.660
- Oh but be happy
with what you have.

38:17.762 --> 38:19.362
You have some big names here.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.197
- Including alfred pope,

38:21.299 --> 38:22.966
Who I think will be worth
more than the others

38:22.968 --> 38:24.600
Since it's his final signature.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.803
- Especially now
that "killian's folly" is set

38:26.805 --> 38:28.405
To become such a big hit.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.443
Is this it here?
- Yes. Why?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.278
- You saw him sign it himself?

38:36.281 --> 38:38.148
- I saw him do it with
my own eyes.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.551
- It's different.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.286
- What do you mean?

38:43.588 --> 38:48.391
- In alfred's final aloha
to his wife,

38:49.461 --> 38:53.363
The a was written by
someone else.

38:53.464 --> 38:54.764
(brackenreid):
But that's impossible.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.999
- Unless...

38:56.768 --> 38:58.702
(dramatic music)

39:10.548 --> 39:12.248
(♪)

39:13.852 --> 39:15.285
(grunts)

39:20.192 --> 39:21.358
It was her.

39:28.699 --> 39:32.335
The "aloha" on these pages

39:32.437 --> 39:35.038
Matched the notes
in your husband's manuscript.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.142
What I failed to identify
was who wrote them.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.812
I trust you know the direction
I'm heading in.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.947
- Haven't the foggiest.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.083
- They were both yours,
mrs. Pope.

39:47.085 --> 39:50.019
You were your husband's
unofficial editor,

39:50.021 --> 39:53.623
The person behind the scenes
who would do anything

39:53.625 --> 39:56.126
To ensure he got that
bestseller.

39:57.696 --> 40:00.697
- Is it against the law
for a wife to help her husband?

40:00.699 --> 40:02.832
- It's against the law
to murder him.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.235
Were you tired of living
in his shadow?

40:06.738 --> 40:09.038
- My husband was too flimsy
to cast a shadow.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.106
A shadow implies mass.

40:11.877 --> 40:15.545
- Yet, you made it seem
as though his obscurity
was a virtue,

40:16.681 --> 40:20.016
That the respect of his peers
was all he needed.

40:20.685 --> 40:21.851
- For him, maybe.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.421
But what about me?

40:25.223 --> 40:26.789
I did half the work.

40:27.225 --> 40:30.393
Do you know how many hours
I spent sculpting his words,

40:30.495 --> 40:31.928
Just so he...

40:32.029 --> 40:36.199
So we could finally have
one bestseller?

40:36.568 --> 40:37.900
- So, it was about money.

40:38.002 --> 40:39.269
- It was about pride.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.139
"killian's folly"
had hit written all over it

40:43.475 --> 40:45.775
And he refused to do
the legwork.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.744
He was a serial self-sabotager,

40:48.846 --> 40:50.813
Missing meetings,
making drunken scenes,

40:50.815 --> 40:52.482
Insulting publishers.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.951
He felt that made him
a real artist.

40:55.921 --> 40:58.154
- You saw things differently.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.190
- He promised me trips,

41:01.560 --> 41:05.261
Spain, ireland and, yes, hawaii.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.898
He wintered on
arthur conan doyle's yacht

41:08.900 --> 41:10.767
While I stayed home

41:11.202 --> 41:13.303
And ate tinned ham and
day-old bread.

41:15.540 --> 41:19.442
What would have made it easier
was to have one bestseller.

41:20.378 --> 41:21.678
Just one.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.982
I needed that, detective.

41:28.386 --> 41:30.420
I needed that at any cost.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.357
(city hubbub)

41:45.169 --> 41:47.670
- "a man is most dangerous
when he's broken..."

41:47.906 --> 41:50.173
(together): "for he has
nothing left to lose."

41:51.643 --> 41:53.276
- You did read my book.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.912
- Of course I did, fathead.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.114
Twice.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.482
It's really good, george.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.818
- I was sure you didn't
remember me.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.821
- Well, you're cute,
but not that bright.

42:06.391 --> 42:10.626
You didn't pick up on my signals
about my fiancé, ewen.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.896
- Ah.
- He's a minister.

42:13.998 --> 42:15.298
Mm-hmm.

42:15.867 --> 42:20.370
Well, he's not quite comfortable
with my previous dalliances.

42:20.872 --> 42:24.641
I didn't want him to know...
That.

42:28.113 --> 42:30.613
I think of you, though. Often.

42:31.515 --> 42:32.916
- I think of you, too.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.851
- I heard you got married.

42:35.853 --> 42:38.988
- I did. Her name is effie.
You'd like her.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.657
- You'd like ewen, too.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.961
Perhaps one day we can
all get together.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.865
- Your book is a cracking
good read, by the way.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.801
- You've read
"anne of green gables"?

42:51.903 --> 42:53.569
- Yes, of course! It's lovely.

42:53.571 --> 42:58.074
Uh, the imagery is
so picturesque, so moving.

42:58.943 --> 43:00.610
It should be a moving picture.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.613
No! A series of moving pictures.

43:03.714 --> 43:05.481
Uh, several incarnations

43:05.483 --> 43:08.017
That win the hearts of canadians
from coast-to-coast.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.785
(laughs)

43:09.887 --> 43:12.755
- Well, I've always loved
your wild imagination, george.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.258
(soft music)

43:16.928 --> 43:19.262
Now, you take care of yourself.

43:20.031 --> 43:21.297
And effie, too.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.499
- You too, lucy maud.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.506
(♪)

43:41.986 --> 43:43.686
(theme music)

44:10.114 --> 44:11.447
Subtitling: Difuze
