-Just the one?
-The burglar's a grass.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Maybe.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.080
[Harry] How many times?

23:51.360 --> 23:53.160
I didn't kill Isabella.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.360
I threatened her with the gun
but I didn't kill her. Come on.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.480
My fingerprints
would be all over that trigger.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.360
That's why I need to get
into the storage facility.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.680

-It's not. I've got help.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.360
So, why do you need me?

24:04.400 --> 24:06.160

it's good you come out of it
with something.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.640
Yeah. Lost my wife and kids...
but, hey, I've got a degree.

6 officer, would you believe me?

25:51.360 --> 25:52.760
Maybe.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.200
I'm just snagging on the fact
that you're a criminal.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.520

25:58.600 --> 26:00.160
you have to swim in their filth.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.120
Maybe this is a front.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.000
This?

26:05.720 --> 26:07.160
Be one hell of a front.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.520
You know what I want?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.360
Not just me.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.080
It's simple, really.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.360
All we want...

26:28.800 --> 26:30.120
is a better world.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.040
If you destroy the bracelets...

26:32.440 --> 26:36.200
you destroy all hope
of there being a better world.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.320
Because the bracelets

26:39.360 --> 26:41.080
-You know they do.
-No.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.280
This is what I know.

For thousands of years...

26:46.320 --> 26:48.400
the bracelets have enriched
e individual whilst causing war,

26:48.440 --> 26:52.520
isease, the deaths of thousands.

26:55.320 --> 26:59.560
who forged them may have wanted
ut didn't factor in the greed...

27:00.640 --> 27:02.800
and the blood lust
of the people that wore them.

27:05.400 --> 27:09.080
How many died since you put
the bracelet on Harry Clayton?

27:10.440 --> 27:12.320

before fact.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.360
Why is that?

27:37.200 --> 27:38.280
Is it because...

27:39.600 --> 27:40.720

28:05.080 --> 28:06.320
-Wait!
-No.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.360
The plan is we go in like
a solid-bond security delivery.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.040
Then we use your codes.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.760
The place is full of cameras,
we'll be identified.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.760

but we only have two minutes.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.760

do the business, get out.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.360

-Oh, how is she?
-How is she?

29:48.600 --> 29:51.000
She dumped me, because of you.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.160
Oh...

29:53.400 --> 29:54.360
Yeah.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.640
This is how you get her back.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.440
No. No. This is how I burn every
bridge I've ever built.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.160
Okay.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.440
What I'm gonna say
might sound borderline insane.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.760
don't think anyone can stop him,
except me.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.520
Well...

30:13.840 --> 30:15.520
You must be desperate,
if you're asking me to drive.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.600
I am, Rich. I am begging you.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.760
omise me you won't do that thing
your eyes, if I crash the gears.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.480
Is this your driver?

30:34.720 --> 30:36.000
Taught him myself.

What does that prove?

32:02.160 --> 32:04.080
You think you have a duty
to Harry Clayton.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.280
But you don't.
