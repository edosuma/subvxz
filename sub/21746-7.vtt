00:30.750 --> 00:31.791
Main gates to patrol.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.166
We have a code red
in section 7. Over.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.541
Attention, emergency protocol

00:36.625 --> 00:38.083
has been activated.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.541
This is not a drill.

00:39.625 --> 00:43.791
Please evacuate sections
3 to 9 immediately.

00:44.416 --> 00:48.125
Attention, emergency protocol
has been activated.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.791
This is not a drill.

00:50.416 --> 00:54.000
Please evacuate
sections 3 to 9 immediately.

00:54.625 --> 00:57.958
Attention, emergency protocol
has been activated.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.166
This is not a drill.

01:48.416 --> 01:49.916
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.458
What can I get you?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.080
I'll have what he's having.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.583
Paint stripper, straight up.

02:12.416 --> 02:13.416
Yeah.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.500
Told you.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.500
I need your help.

02:27.458 --> 02:28.541
I very much doubt it.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.333
You made accusations
against our company.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.541
I'm looking into them.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.375
Your company is not
my fucking problem anymore.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.500
You said it was Dr. Bouchard's.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.166
Did she ever mention
a place called Reverie?

02:48.125 --> 02:49.166
Fuck knows.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
But...

02:55.958 --> 02:57.375
your boss is a murderer.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.298
And there's a witness
floating about out there.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.583
So, I'd watch your back
if I were you.

03:01.666 --> 03:02.666
Thanks for the drink.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.041
Fuck.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.125
Dad?

03:42.958 --> 03:44.041
Hi, hi.

03:44.958 --> 03:45.958
You all right?

03:47.208 --> 03:48.583
Yeah, I'm all right.
You all right?

03:48.833 --> 03:51.000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming up.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
All right...

03:56.250 --> 03:57.708
Fuck.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.083
Shit.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.083
Hello.

04:06.458 --> 04:07.666
Thank fuck for that.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.708
Ooh, yeah. Fucking hell.

04:50.625 --> 04:51.625
Yep.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.458
Coming.

04:56.541 --> 04:57.541
F...

05:00.500 --> 05:01.500
All right?

05:01.583 --> 05:02.625
Bought you some shopping.

05:02.708 --> 05:03.708
Nice.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.416
You missed a few.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.500
Yeah, well, I didn't know
you were coming, did I?

05:10.583 --> 05:12.375
Clearly. You need looking after.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.708
You need looking after.

05:16.375 --> 05:17.458
Yes, I do.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.291
You already emptied it.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
How thoughtful.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.250
Do you want coffee?

05:53.416 --> 05:54.416
Hey, hey.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.333
I'm sorry.

06:00.416 --> 06:01.416
You okay?

06:02.333 --> 06:03.333
Yeah.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.583
Hi, sorry, just mind
your head on the tap.

06:10.958 --> 06:12.166
Here.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.541
Are these your shoes?

06:13.916 --> 06:14.916
Yeah.

06:21.833 --> 06:22.916
Where are their clothes?

06:23.375 --> 06:24.625
Um, in the bed.

06:26.958 --> 06:27.958
Shoes are underneath.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.125
Chief, it's Denise.
Call me back, it's urgent.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.291
Yeah, we found some
tire tracks over there.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.500
Yeah. Right over there. Yeah.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.750
We need to talk to you.

08:32.375 --> 08:33.832
The car was doused in gasoline.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.376
And the victim had two
bullet wounds in his chest.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.582
We've confirmed time
of death as three days ago

08:40.666 --> 08:42.582
between 18 and 2400 hours.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.791
And eight witnesses who
saw you leaving Randy's bar

08:45.875 --> 08:47.250
shortly before that time frame.

08:48.458 --> 08:49.500
With a big black guy

08:49.583 --> 08:51.666
who happened to match
the profile of the victim.

08:56.416 --> 08:57.458
We ran the plates.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.166
Victim's name is Roger Crouch.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.750
A North Stream Oil employee.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.208
His physical description
matches the guy

09:06.291 --> 09:07.541
you were seen leaving with.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.583
I wanna make a phone call.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.041
Can I help you?

11:08.791 --> 11:11.083
You filed a complaint against
one of our employees,

11:11.166 --> 11:12.250
Monsieur Louis Gagnon?

11:12.333 --> 11:13.458
Yeah.

11:13.541 --> 11:16.291
Some of the families up here
didn't think much of you guys.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.750
Why would anyone have a problem
with carbon capture?

11:20.625 --> 11:22.666
Taking the bad stuff
and making it safe, right?

11:23.541 --> 11:25.083
Mr. Gagnon...

11:25.958 --> 11:27.583
was a little overeager on...

11:28.250 --> 11:30.000
getting our community onside.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.083
We just asked him
to ease off some.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.125
It was all sorted out.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.375
And how exactly did.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.708
Monsieur Gagnon get
people onside?

11:42.750 --> 11:44.125
There might've been some...

11:45.500 --> 11:46.625
misunderstandings.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.500
Is he paying you?

12:02.708 --> 12:04.541
You accusing me of corruption?

12:06.250 --> 12:07.708
I just asked a question.

12:10.708 --> 12:12.125
I think you better leave.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.750
Dangerous out here for
a rich white lady on her own.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.541
I'll have my, deputy
escort you to the perimeter.

12:45.791 --> 12:47.375
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.291
I can arrange
my own transportation.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.375
Must have been...

13:05.416 --> 13:08.583
I don't remem...
No later than 6:00.

13:09.541 --> 13:11.541
No, no, it was exactly 6:00.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.666
I remember because
I had the radio on.

13:14.416 --> 13:15.416
What station?

13:15.833 --> 13:16.958
Bonjour FM.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.583
French Canadian.

13:18.666 --> 13:21.958
My French is shite,
but they play really good music.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.580
Well, if it was in French,
how did you know the time?

13:27.500 --> 13:29.125
There's a clock on the radio.

13:31.541 --> 13:32.583
What's this about?

13:33.041 --> 13:34.083
So, thereafter,

13:34.166 --> 13:36.046
Chief Worth was with you
for the entire evening?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.541
That's right, thereafter.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.291
What did you two do?

13:49.708 --> 13:50.708
We made love.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.833
Actually, no, that's not...

13:54.250 --> 13:56.625
actually accurate.
We fucked is what it was.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.203
'Cause my husband was drunk.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.250
Mrs. Worth, is your husband
violent when he's drunk?

14:08.125 --> 14:10.083
You mean rough sex?

14:10.750 --> 14:13.166
I don't mean that. I mean...

14:13.250 --> 14:15.083
physical violence.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.184
He could hardly walk a straight
line when he got home,

14:18.208 --> 14:20.791
much less land a punch, so, no.

14:22.916 --> 14:25.708
How did your husband
get home, Mrs. Worth?

14:28.666 --> 14:30.791
He drove himself.
Is that what this is about?

14:30.875 --> 14:34.166
About drunk driving?
I've told him...

14:34.250 --> 14:36.059
I've told him how strict
you are about that here,

14:36.083 --> 14:37.916
and you're right, he...
He shouldn't...

14:38.000 --> 14:39.708
Mrs. Worth,
do you recognize that man?

14:43.458 --> 14:44.458
No.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.416
Should I?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.666
What if we ask you to sign

14:47.750 --> 14:49.059
a witness statement
to that effect,

14:49.083 --> 14:50.125
would you do so?

14:51.375 --> 14:52.375
A witness statement?

14:55.833 --> 14:57.083
So, this is an investigation?

14:58.541 --> 14:59.833
Jesus, what's happened?

15:06.166 --> 15:07.166
How's Anna?

15:07.833 --> 15:09.416
She misses her brother.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
Yeah.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.625
She say anything?

15:12.875 --> 15:13.875
About what?

15:14.333 --> 15:15.333
Ask her.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.500
Jesus, Jim.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.458
How are you gonna
get out of this one?

15:26.500 --> 15:27.916
I'll think of something.

15:28.625 --> 15:29.750
You'd better fucking had.

16:19.416 --> 16:20.625
It should've been me.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.458
He was only five.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.333
He'd never hurt anyone.
Everyone loved him.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.083
It wasn't meant for him.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.250
What?

17:29.958 --> 17:30.958
The bullet.

17:32.583 --> 17:33.916
It was meant for your dad.

17:36.708 --> 17:37.708
So?

17:38.458 --> 17:39.458
So,

17:39.833 --> 17:41.916
maybe you'd be better off
without him.

17:43.541 --> 17:46.041
II can't leave him, he's my dad.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.500
Why not?

17:50.458 --> 17:51.583
Well, where would I go?

17:53.375 --> 17:54.375
With me.

18:34.916 --> 18:35.916
Shit.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.041
Pull up a chair, handsome.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.958
- Sneak a preview?
- Fuck off.

18:42.708 --> 18:43.875
Something wrong?

18:43.958 --> 18:45.375
No, love, not at all. Um...

18:46.250 --> 18:47.458
It's just a new supplier.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.583
It's a decent fake.

18:57.958 --> 19:01.875
You touched down in
Vancouver three weeks ago.

19:01.958 --> 19:07.041
First thing you do is visit
a specialist reptile outlet.

19:07.125 --> 19:10.125
Purchase a saw scaled viper.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.458
The weapons you acquire
the next day...

19:15.041 --> 19:18.250
from your contacts
with the Vancouver heroin trade.

19:18.333 --> 19:22.375
One of them is
an RCFP informant.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.458
Likely he would
testify in court.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.083
Now, if the Police Chief
isn't on to you already,

19:30.166 --> 19:32.250
he soon will be,

19:32.333 --> 19:35.625
especially if I tell him
what I just told you.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.208
What do you want?

19:41.708 --> 19:43.916
Don't buy guns from an informer.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.791
What would I want guns for?

19:45.875 --> 19:47.500
Come on, Frankie!

19:48.875 --> 19:50.000
Up your game.

19:50.916 --> 19:51.958
Show me

19:52.875 --> 19:54.083
you have

19:54.958 --> 19:56.875
what it takes

19:57.541 --> 19:59.375
to finish

20:00.166 --> 20:02.166
what you started.

20:07.208 --> 20:08.291
Kill him,

20:12.750 --> 20:14.791
or I shut you down.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.250
You've got your own goons.

20:20.375 --> 20:21.708
Traceable to me.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.583
Why are you doing this?

20:30.583 --> 20:33.750
Let's just say
the Chief and I, we...

20:34.666 --> 20:36.375
have a score to settle.

20:58.416 --> 20:59.416
Ever seen that man?

21:00.500 --> 21:01.833
He worked for North Stream Oil.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.625
Excuse me. Ever seen this man?

21:30.833 --> 21:32.875
The fuck you staring at, girl?

21:43.875 --> 21:44.875
What?

21:45.916 --> 21:47.416
I don't think we should do this.

21:48.833 --> 21:49.875
Why not?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.083
Because I care about you.

21:53.958 --> 21:54.958
So?

21:55.666 --> 21:57.186
More than I've ever
cared about anyone.

22:00.083 --> 22:01.791
That's sweet.

22:57.166 --> 22:59.333
Private
Investigations, can I help?

23:00.166 --> 23:01.166
Yeah.

23:02.625 --> 23:05.416
Are you calling regarding
a new or existing case?

23:06.375 --> 23:07.375
Existing.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.041
Case number?

23:10.583 --> 23:11.583
373.

23:11.750 --> 23:12.958
373.

23:13.416 --> 23:14.958
- Mr. Devlin?
- That's me.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.583
We have a DNA match.

23:24.958 --> 23:26.458
You really gonna let him go?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.291
No.

23:49.541 --> 23:50.541
You all right?

23:51.333 --> 23:52.750
Angela's lying for you.

23:53.625 --> 23:54.625
You think?

24:00.500 --> 24:02.166
I found this
inside the burned out car.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.208
Wild Buffalo, it's your brand.

24:04.791 --> 24:05.833
It's anyone's brand.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.000
Yet, you're quite good
at this cop thing.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.500
You're better than me anyway.

24:10.833 --> 24:12.333
You're a bit by the book, but...

24:12.875 --> 24:13.875
you're above average.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.166
Nobody knows about this yet.

24:27.958 --> 24:29.638
I need you to
tell me the truth, all of it.

24:33.625 --> 24:34.708
Put your seat belt on.

24:39.583 --> 24:40.583
Here, come here.

24:56.791 --> 24:58.958
His real name
is Reginald Godswill.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.250
How do you know that?

25:01.333 --> 25:04.000
Well I'm not exactly,
um, a cop, Denise.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.240
I'm more of a criminal, really.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.458
Um...

25:08.916 --> 25:10.833
Licensed by the state
to catch other criminals.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.791
Like an undercover cop?

25:15.333 --> 25:17.250
About 20 years.

25:18.208 --> 25:19.601
Mostly hanging around
the kind of assholes

25:19.625 --> 25:20.825
that this man associated with.

25:23.291 --> 25:24.416
So he came here

25:25.416 --> 25:27.333
to kill you and accidentally
killed your son?

25:30.875 --> 25:34.166
Nah, that was a...
That was a little fellow.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.583
He's still running around
out there somewhere.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.166
Well...

25:48.875 --> 25:49.875
You're gonna need that,

25:50.416 --> 25:51.416
if you wanna find him.

25:54.958 --> 25:55.958
Cheers.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.476
- Afternoon, Chief.
- All right?

26:13.500 --> 26:14.416
Do you have an appointment?

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
No, open up.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.684
Alrighty, um, can I ask
the purpose of your visit?

26:17.708 --> 26:19.083
Murder inquiry.

26:19.916 --> 26:21.833
Gonna be searching
some of your trailers here.

26:21.916 --> 26:23.458
Which one belongs
to Roger Crouch?

26:23.541 --> 26:25.141
I'll just need to talk
to somebody first.

26:25.541 --> 26:26.981
Well, you're talking
to somebody now.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.791
Sorry, Chief,
there's protocol and all,

26:28.875 --> 26:30.075
even with the Chief of Police.

26:42.791 --> 26:45.250
Number 6 to number 1,
we've got a problem here.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.166
Roger Crouch, you know him?

26:57.875 --> 26:59.375
- Worked with him?
- No.

26:59.458 --> 27:00.978
- Know where his trailer is?
- No, man.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.791
Nothing? Absolutely nothing?

27:08.041 --> 27:09.166
State your business.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.666
Roger Crouch, works for you.
Want to search his trailer.

27:12.750 --> 27:13.750
Warrant.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.041
I don't need one.

27:15.125 --> 27:16.125
Place of work, remember?

27:16.208 --> 27:18.833
Residential accommodation,
not a workplace.

27:18.916 --> 27:20.276
- No warrant, no search.
- Fuck it.

27:25.041 --> 27:26.833
I'm done fighting.

27:26.916 --> 27:27.916
Who's fighting?

27:30.125 --> 27:31.267
I'm just trying
to find the fellow

27:31.291 --> 27:32.625
who killed my kid, that's all.

27:33.125 --> 27:34.750
And I could've helped you.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.208
Well, you still could.

27:36.958 --> 27:38.851
I could let you off
for assaulting a police officer,

27:38.875 --> 27:40.083
if that'd help.

27:40.166 --> 27:41.833
I could shut down
the Bouchard case.

27:41.916 --> 27:42.916
What case?

27:43.416 --> 27:44.666
Your witness disappeared.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.625
And besides,
you broke into my home

27:46.708 --> 27:47.916
and tried to strangle me,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.125
motherfucker.

27:50.958 --> 27:54.333
A man like you, he makes
too many enemies, Mr. Devlin.

27:55.833 --> 27:57.750
Get out of Little Big Bear,

27:59.375 --> 28:01.000
while you still can.

28:16.458 --> 28:17.458
Merci.

28:35.041 --> 28:37.541
I get it, you're still
gonna have to wait.

28:37.625 --> 28:38.500
You know what?

28:38.583 --> 28:40.375
Just take a seat for me,
all right? Sit down.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.541
What were you two talking about?

28:42.916 --> 28:43.958
The case.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.791
You're discussing the case
with the prime suspect?

28:48.333 --> 28:50.125
What the hell is wrong
with you, Denise?

28:50.958 --> 28:52.478
Anyone else would be
all over this guy,

28:52.541 --> 28:54.250
instead you're slamming
on the brakes.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.625
You're sneaking out for some
cozy fucking tÃªteatÃªte.

28:56.916 --> 28:58.375
- TÃªteatÃªte...
- Stop it!

28:59.000 --> 29:00.791
Don't cut me out. Okay, Denise?

29:00.875 --> 29:02.315
I'm a good cop.
I don't deserve that.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.541
I'm not cutting you out.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.065
Then what were you two
talking about?

29:06.500 --> 29:09.375
Chief has decided not to
make his resignation official.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.666
He's keeping his star.

29:14.208 --> 29:15.416
What the fuck?

29:21.291 --> 29:23.333
I see you, you don't see me.

29:23.416 --> 29:25.416
Guaranteed Mexican army issue.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.083
The official Mexican army,
not some beaner dope cartel.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.166
Yeah.

29:30.958 --> 29:33.083
Just a gun, thanks.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.875
No problemo.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.041
Now, the beauty of these
is they stow in your pants

29:42.125 --> 29:44.291
with little or no profile,

29:44.375 --> 29:46.125
but when they do come out,

29:47.500 --> 29:49.166
the recalcitrant patron,

29:49.541 --> 29:52.291
immediately gets the message.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.875
III don't need
to scare any drunks.

29:55.583 --> 29:58.416
I just need something
I can use once and,

30:00.083 --> 30:01.125
the job's done.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.583
The job you have
in mind being...

30:04.125 --> 30:05.291
Stop something dead.

30:07.625 --> 30:08.875
Like a bear.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.958
We are attuned, friend.

30:13.583 --> 30:15.708
I have exactly
what you're looking for.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.500
The Desert Eagle.

30:23.166 --> 30:25.250
Classic for a reason.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.250
Gas operated,
.357 magnum rounds.

30:29.375 --> 30:32.041
Put down any person, or, bear,

30:32.750 --> 30:34.166
you're ever gonna run into.

30:37.041 --> 30:38.166
Feel the feel.

30:40.708 --> 30:41.916
Yeah.

30:49.958 --> 30:51.041
How much?

30:51.291 --> 30:52.333
550.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.250
Comp me in next Saturday night,

30:54.791 --> 30:56.500
the wet tshirt shindig, and

30:57.166 --> 30:59.000
I'll throw in these pups
for 700.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.083
Bears come out at night, right?

31:16.583 --> 31:17.625
Gagnon.

31:17.791 --> 31:18.791
Yeah.

31:19.166 --> 31:20.291
She's here.

31:20.375 --> 31:21.458
Letendre?

31:21.958 --> 31:23.875
With some lady
from North Stream.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.583
What?

31:25.708 --> 31:29.000
Yeah, she came sniffing
around my office this afternoon.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.416
Asking questions.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.291
About you.

31:33.416 --> 31:34.791
Keep her there.

32:05.041 --> 32:06.833
There was no wind that night.

32:08.458 --> 32:11.458
CO2 from one of your pipelines

32:12.500 --> 32:14.125
seeped out through a crack.

32:16.041 --> 32:17.416
It came in our place.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.500
It started downstairs,

32:22.916 --> 32:24.208
my kids' room.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.416
I thought they were sleeping!

32:32.500 --> 32:33.916
They were dead.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.166
I found Dr. Bouchard's report.

33:06.958 --> 33:09.458
She was discredited because
no one from your community

33:09.541 --> 33:11.083
came forward to corroborate it.

33:11.958 --> 33:12.958
Why?

33:13.333 --> 33:15.708
We signed NDAs.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.083
Some of us took money and...

33:20.583 --> 33:22.708
some of us were intimidated,
but not me.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.958
Is the man who paid them
named Louis Gagnon?

33:29.250 --> 33:30.250
Yeah.

33:31.958 --> 33:33.208
I can help you.

33:33.291 --> 33:36.500
Yeah, that's what
Dr. Bouchard said too.

33:38.541 --> 33:41.250
Just another fucking mighty
white woman coming along

33:41.333 --> 33:43.833
trying to save
the Indian squaw, is that it?

33:43.916 --> 33:45.166
That's it...

33:45.250 --> 33:47.500
All I need you to do is sign
some sort of testimony.

33:50.791 --> 33:51.875
Yeah, right.

33:53.208 --> 33:55.166
And I end up like Suzy.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.083
What happened to Suzy?

34:02.458 --> 34:04.833
You can't fucking
come here all...

34:04.916 --> 34:07.166
dressed all fucking fancy
like that

34:07.250 --> 34:09.500
and suck the oil from my land

34:09.583 --> 34:11.083
and fucking poison my kids

34:11.166 --> 34:13.416
and then expect me to trust you.

34:14.333 --> 34:15.625
Fuck that.

34:16.833 --> 34:18.713
Why are you talking to me
if you don't trust me?

34:21.625 --> 34:25.583
I don't know.

34:31.875 --> 34:32.875
You got kids?

34:34.875 --> 34:35.875
Two.

34:42.583 --> 34:43.875
Maybe that's why.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.916
Is there another way
off this reserve?

35:01.458 --> 35:02.458
Yeah, m...

35:03.541 --> 35:06.291
My brotherinlaw's place
backs onto the highway.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.458
Does he have a car?

35:07.875 --> 35:08.875
Why?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.791
I've put you in danger
being here.

35:12.333 --> 35:13.583
You need to come with me.

35:14.916 --> 35:17.583
Don't fucking tell me
what to do.

35:17.666 --> 35:20.708
I ain't fucking doing
anything you tell me to do.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.208
Fuck that.

35:34.791 --> 35:36.708
You're the only good thing
that's happened to me

35:36.791 --> 35:37.791
since Petey died.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.791
Get dressed.

35:54.541 --> 35:55.541
What?

35:56.416 --> 35:57.416
I'm taking you home.

35:58.708 --> 36:01.375
No, I don't wanna go home.
Home's shit.

36:02.375 --> 36:03.458
I wanna be here with you.

36:04.875 --> 36:06.155
Well, that's not
going to happen.

36:06.916 --> 36:07.916
We're done here.

36:09.666 --> 36:10.666
What?

36:13.791 --> 36:15.583
It was your first time,
weren't it?

36:16.500 --> 36:17.500
Sounded like it.

36:19.041 --> 36:20.833
Crying like a fucking baby.

36:21.250 --> 36:22.458
It was fucking offputting.

36:27.041 --> 36:28.791
Clean yourself up, we're going.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.625
Organized crime?

36:43.708 --> 36:45.791
- You said this was North Stream.
- Yeah, I did.

36:46.791 --> 36:48.666
You publicly denounced them.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.250
I mean, that's what it says.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Right?

36:54.041 --> 36:56.121
I mean, I could've been right,
I could've been wrong.

36:56.708 --> 37:01.500
So, the police were right?
This is a local biker thing?

37:01.583 --> 37:02.583
He's English.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.250
So what?

37:05.583 --> 37:07.263
I think it's got something
to do with Jack.

37:09.958 --> 37:10.958
What?

37:17.583 --> 37:18.583
Fucker.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.625
So our son died because...

37:29.833 --> 37:31.083
of something you did?

37:53.583 --> 37:55.500
It was your first time too,
wasn't it?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.791
Wasn't me crying like a baby,
it was you.

38:03.750 --> 38:05.958
Nothing you can do
will ever hurt me.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.708
You were a mistake.

38:27.083 --> 38:28.523
You really think
this is a good idea?

38:29.625 --> 38:30.750
He gets things done.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.875
If I killed our son,

38:46.958 --> 38:48.250
if I fucking killed our son,

38:49.375 --> 38:52.791
do you really think it's a good
idea to bring Jack here?

38:57.916 --> 38:59.250
What choice do we have?

39:57.541 --> 39:58.541
Fuck it.

40:57.041 --> 40:58.125
You've come undone.

41:03.833 --> 41:04.833
Everything okay?

41:21.333 --> 41:22.791
What's he gonna do?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Come inside.

41:35.875 --> 41:37.083
Evening, Mr. Worth.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.208
Were you gentle?

41:47.791 --> 41:48.871
I don't know what you mean.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.375
When you fucked my daughter,
were you gentle?

42:15.708 --> 42:17.041
Come on, come inside.

44:20.750 --> 44:21.750
Main gates to patrol.

44:21.791 --> 44:24.083
Attention, emergency protocol

44:24.166 --> 44:25.583

has been activated.

45:36.583 --> 45:37.958
This is not a drill...

45:58.000 --> 46:00.083
Why would a fellow
sent over here to kill me

46:00.166 --> 46:01.791
need to dress up as a biker?

46:06.583 --> 46:09.166
Maybe the North Stream robbery,

46:10.333 --> 46:11.333
it was a setup?

46:12.958 --> 46:14.250
Three guys who shot me

46:15.333 --> 46:17.208
dressed up as bikers,
robbed the truck

46:17.291 --> 46:18.500
to try and get a shot at you?

46:20.916 --> 46:23.458
I need to know if this bullet

46:24.416 --> 46:26.833
matches the bullet
that was fired into my house.

46:29.333 --> 46:30.625
Put the gun down, you tit.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.916
Now, you might need that.

47:20.125 --> 47:22.541
Whoa, whoa,
what the fuck's going on?

47:23.750 --> 47:24.875
Okay, relax.

47:24.958 --> 47:26.083
Look at our fucking bikes.

47:26.166 --> 47:27.166
What bikes?

47:30.208 --> 47:31.458
Let's go. Let's go.

47:34.125 --> 47:35.125
You know him?

47:37.583 --> 47:38.625
Guess so.

47:38.708 --> 47:40.875
Customer, maybe. Why?

47:40.958 --> 47:42.708
British fellow,
came here to kill me.

47:43.583 --> 47:45.000
Got two mates.

47:45.083 --> 47:46.083
Heard anything?

47:46.791 --> 47:48.875
No, I'll ask around, Chief.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.958
I'm gonna ask you a question,

48:08.041 --> 48:09.500
and I want a straight answer.

48:09.916 --> 48:10.916
Go on.

48:11.375 --> 48:13.375
That debt of honor
that you came here to settle

48:13.458 --> 48:14.541
doesn't have anything to do

48:14.625 --> 48:16.041
with the Chief of Police,
does it?

48:19.083 --> 48:20.083
Who's asking?

48:20.166 --> 48:21.166
The Chief of Police.

48:24.833 --> 48:26.375
What exactly is he asking you?

48:26.750 --> 48:29.750
He said that three Brits
had come here to kill him.

48:30.750 --> 48:32.125
He asked me
if I'd heard anything.

48:53.458 --> 48:54.791
Holy fuck, Frank!

48:54.875 --> 48:56.375
His real name is Jack Devlin.

48:56.458 --> 48:58.708
He doesn't know me from Adam,
but he soon will.

48:58.791 --> 49:01.083
Jesus Christ, you said
you had a loose end to tie up,

49:01.166 --> 49:02.976
did that mean killing
the goddamn chief of police?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.375
I haven't got any choice, love.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.375
Frank, listen to me.

49:08.041 --> 49:09.708
I don't know what
your debt of honor is,

49:09.791 --> 49:11.625
and right now
I don't give a shit.

49:11.708 --> 49:13.708
And I'm telling you,
that man would sooner kill you

49:13.750 --> 49:14.767
than give you
the time of the day.

49:14.791 --> 49:15.791
I know this.

49:19.250 --> 49:20.250
Walk.

49:21.083 --> 49:21.958
Walk?

49:22.041 --> 49:23.521
I'll cover for you.
I'll buy you time.

49:25.833 --> 49:27.458
Walk out the back door,

49:27.541 --> 49:29.291
then keep walking
and don't turn back.

49:30.375 --> 49:31.750
And leave you in the lurch?

49:32.375 --> 49:33.583
No, I will join you.

49:33.666 --> 49:35.500
Yeah? And what about this place?

49:35.583 --> 49:36.726
This is bricks
and mortar, Frank.

49:36.750 --> 49:38.267
I'd rather lose this place
than lose you.

49:38.291 --> 49:39.791
No, I am not running!

49:41.666 --> 49:43.875
And that fucker has shat
on my dreams once before.

49:43.958 --> 49:46.625
I am not gonna let him
do it again. Do you hear me?

49:46.708 --> 49:48.083
I will take care of it.

49:49.791 --> 49:50.958
For us.

49:51.541 --> 49:52.791
And then we'll be free.

49:53.416 --> 49:55.267
Let me just go out there
and put him off the scent.

49:55.291 --> 49:56.125
Please, Frank, please.

49:56.208 --> 49:57.750
No, you're not gonna do
my dirty work.

49:59.833 --> 50:01.166
I'm gonna damn well try.

50:03.791 --> 50:05.125
You, fucking walk.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.875
Nothing happens in this town

50:18.958 --> 50:20.583
I don't find out
about sooner or later.

50:22.916 --> 50:24.541
If I get wind of anything,

50:24.625 --> 50:25.708
I'll let you know.

50:26.958 --> 50:28.291
Good. 'Cause...

50:30.041 --> 50:31.921
the men who tried to kill me,
they fucked it up.

50:32.791 --> 50:34.166
They killed my boy instead.

50:36.375 --> 50:37.375
He was only five.

50:39.208 --> 50:40.666
Five and half,
if you're counting.

50:53.041 --> 50:54.561
Is there something
you want to tell me?

50:57.875 --> 50:58.875
No.

50:59.041 --> 51:02.083
I just...
Like I said, I'll ask around.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.333
Who's your new friend?

51:19.625 --> 51:21.916
He's, the new partner.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.083
He's a backer, actually.
II still run this place.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.333
Mind if I talk to him?

51:29.958 --> 51:31.083
No, I'll go get him for you.

51:31.166 --> 51:32.366
That's all right, I've got it.

51:33.833 --> 51:35.958
Wait, no, you can't
go back there.
