00:02.040 --> 00:04.319
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.479
I'm not one for sentiment.
It's not in my genes,

00:06.480 --> 00:09.919
but I suppose
the occasion deserves it.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.599
It's a year since Adrian went
into that place, which means

00:13.600 --> 00:16.159
that it's a year and two
weeks since Adrian said

00:16.160 --> 00:19.279
he was going to Waitrose,
and then got home a fortnight later,

00:19.280 --> 00:21.359
having lost 2st
and gained a tattoo.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.759
People underestimate the
dietary value of cocaine.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.919
What's the tattoo?

00:27.920 --> 00:29.239
Geronimo.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.679
It looks like Jimmy Krankie.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.159
Where did you lose the two weeks?

00:32.160 --> 00:34.599
Oh, it's not really about
the immediate surroundings

00:34.600 --> 00:37.159
for that stuff. No!
It's about the glamour of it

00:37.160 --> 00:39.919
which, in Adrian's case, meant
a fortnight off his tits

00:39.920 --> 00:41.359
in a Travelodge.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.559
Oh! It was a Premier Inn.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.199
I can't help feeling this speech
has gone off the rails just a bit.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.399
If I was one for sentiment,
then I'd not thank Adrian -

00:49.400 --> 00:53.279
that's a bit much - but
I would acknowledge that,

00:53.280 --> 00:55.559
one way or another, you've
managed to pull yourself up

00:55.560 --> 00:57.599
to somewhere near normality.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.479
I'm glad you got there

00:59.480 --> 01:01.999
and I hope you stay there.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.959
She means stay boring.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.520
Yeah, I do.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.360
So, here's to boring.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.480
ALL: To boring.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.679
Mm. Mmm.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.160
Do you like wine? Yes, it's good.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.800
VOICE FADES: Can I
get anyone coffee?

03:14.520 --> 03:17.000
You're as high as a fucking kite.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.319
It's over.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.519
Obviously.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.959
There's...

03:23.960 --> 03:27.159
There's 100 grand, easy.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.199
Where have you been?

03:29.200 --> 03:30.719
I, er... I couldn't sleep.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.399
Clearly. I went out and
one thing led to another.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.319
But the important thing is
that this was an accident.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.119
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.959
And this is it - this is
us getting out of the hole.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.119
I wasn't aware that
we were in a hole.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.159
Well, you know, my rehab's
still on the credit cards

03:47.160 --> 03:49.879
and there's another few, um...
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

03:49.880 --> 03:51.919
Look, this is it - the way out.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.720
We took money out of the
house to pay off the rehab.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.799
But you didn't pay it off

03:57.800 --> 04:01.639
and you've spent that money
because you never stopped.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.519
You're pathetic.
I'll sort myself out, I promise.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.999
This is what I needed -
a clean slate. You've never wanted

04:07.000 --> 04:09.719
for anything in your life, and
that includes clean fucking slates!

04:09.720 --> 04:12.199
This is different. You know,
people like you, you grow up with

04:12.200 --> 04:14.519
so much safety that you
think danger is exciting.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.640
Well, it's not.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.679
It's pain and misery

04:18.680 --> 04:21.399
and desperate men
doing desperate things.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.679
I was thinking that maybe we
could speak to... I'm leaving now.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.360
I'm going upstairs, packing
a bag and I'm leaving.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.080
And I wish you luck.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.479
Because a man like you
in a world like that

04:34.480 --> 04:36.760
is going to need plenty of luck.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.680
I don't... I don't know what to do.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.519
I don't know what to do next.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.200
That's how it starts.

Big mistake, buddy.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.680
Big mistake.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.640
Argh! Agh.

MUSIC: F-oldin' Money
by The Fall

07:25.600 --> 07:29.360
# I went to the bank
just to get a little money

07:31.720 --> 07:35.080
# When he told me their requirements
I started feeling funny

07:36.200 --> 07:40.719
# He said, "You ain't got a
house, you ain't got a plot"

07:40.720 --> 07:43.239
# I ain't got a window
and I ain't got a job

07:43.240 --> 07:46.359
# But it takes a lot of
blue-backs to satisfy my honey

07:46.360 --> 07:49.280
# If I could get my hands
on some f-oldin' money

07:54.640 --> 07:57.760
# Well, I went to the social
just to get a little pension

08:00.360 --> 08:04.400
# I was sorely in distress
I was getting some attention

08:05.720 --> 08:08.959
# They said, "You don't get a
copper, you don't get a dime"

08:08.960 --> 08:10.479
# That's why I broke his jaw

08:10.480 --> 08:11.959
# That's why I'm doing time

08:11.960 --> 08:15.159
# But it takes a lot of
blue-backs to satisfy my honey

08:15.160 --> 08:18.320
# If I could get my hands
on some f-oldin' money...

08:25.680 --> 08:27.720
YOUTHS SHOUT

08:35.600 --> 08:39.000
# And then I got a letter
off my lawyer in the city

08:40.480 --> 08:44.720
# He said, "You're gonna come and
see me - boy, it really is a pity"

08:47.520 --> 08:51.040
# Those savings you got
in the casino disappeared

08:53.160 --> 08:56.480
# And he went out the
window real quick, honey

08:59.040 --> 09:02.480
# And I'll do it all again
but it may sound funny. #

09:25.320 --> 09:27.240
HE SNIFFS

09:35.440 --> 09:37.919
I don't have a story.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.839
Not yet.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.239
I sit here and I watch you tell
your stories and I'm grateful,

09:45.240 --> 09:48.680
because you let me sit
here without speaking...

09:50.640 --> 09:53.599
..then count another meeting,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.080
another day.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.120
I've done 100 days and...

10:00.680 --> 10:03.040
..maybe I'm close to one
where I tell a story, too.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.160
Thank you.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.079
How do you do it - sit there
and offer up your worst moments?

10:21.080 --> 10:24.760
Well, offering them up
robs them of something.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.239
I don't think about who
I was before I came here.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.319
Neither do I, but the more
I talk about who I was in there,

10:32.320 --> 10:35.239
the more I leave him in there.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.360
Give it a go when you're ready.
ALARM BEEPS

10:39.880 --> 10:42.559
Nice motor!

10:42.560 --> 10:44.479
It was his pride and joy.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.239
Divorce, you know.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.199
Little victories.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.280
Where are parked?
Er, round the corner.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.879
Maybe sometime we could...

10:54.880 --> 10:58.320
I don't know, meet and do what
people do when they don't drink.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.039
Tea! Oh.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.199
Is that what people do -
meet up for cups of tea? Um...

11:06.200 --> 11:08.559
We-we... We can't meet up, um,

11:08.560 --> 11:10.279
not away from here.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.839
Oh, right, um...

11:11.840 --> 11:14.519
It's sort of, um,
sort of frowned upon.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.039
Yeah, I get it.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.079
Yeah. You can call me, if you like.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.279
Um, I'm only just
in the door myself,

11:21.280 --> 11:24.359
in the grand scheme of things,
but... I'd like that.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.080
See you later. See you.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.880
I'll bring that back.

12:23.840 --> 12:28.079
It is important, Roy, to
recognise that things have changed.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.719
Very good.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.080
I accept the fall.
The fall was deserved.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.119
Perhaps, at some level,
the fall was needed.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.439
What I cannot accept is how
far it is being suggested

12:41.440 --> 12:42.960
that I have fallen.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.959
It's disproportionate.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.359
It's not right.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.520
I see.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.079
Because there's another
way it could have gone.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.159
A way where I would have
barely fallen at all,

12:58.160 --> 13:00.280
but others would have, Roy.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.159
You would have,

13:03.160 --> 13:05.839
but I didn't pursue that option.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.959
I kept quiet.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.599
I sat in that cell

13:10.600 --> 13:12.560
for two years with...

13:14.320 --> 13:16.719
..a lunatic for company,

13:16.720 --> 13:18.280
and kept quiet.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.759
And so I'm asking you,
with respect,

13:23.760 --> 13:25.639
to soften the fall.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.840
Two years.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.079
The game's crooked.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.719
I'm a lawyer.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.760
Well...

13:34.360 --> 13:36.479
Now, you're out

13:36.480 --> 13:39.959
and wounded, and bitter,

13:39.960 --> 13:42.359
and greedy.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.280
This is not greed.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.399
It is many things,
but it is not greed.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.599
I've already granted you
the greatest favour I can.

13:52.600 --> 13:58.159
I have allowed you to continue
to breathe the rich air of Edinburgh

13:58.160 --> 14:01.599
and you'll continue to do
so as long as you're...

14:01.600 --> 14:03.880
Ha. ...irrelevant.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.319
Just...

14:07.320 --> 14:09.119
..need a piece...

14:09.120 --> 14:11.719
..of what I had, of who
I was - just a piece.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.960
And I can get myself
back from there.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.920
No matter who you are, Max...

14:18.400 --> 14:20.359
..you come out of there

14:20.360 --> 14:23.679
and you find that your old
life has run for the hills.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.839
Except that it hasn't run
very far, though, has it?

14:25.840 --> 14:27.559
I mean, this was my business.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.799
And you owe me for this,
for everything.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.279
HE SCOFFS

14:33.280 --> 14:36.200
Even if that were true,
I can't engage with you.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.119
Not now that I'm legit.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.120
Not now that you're
dirtier than ever.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.359
You are still falling, Max.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.880
You have yet to land.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.520
And if you're looking
for salvation...

14:54.600 --> 14:56.280
..you should aim a little lower.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.880
Damage.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.759
The damage you do...

15:19.760 --> 15:22.679
I wasn't exactly
spared damage myself.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.759
How was it?

15:24.760 --> 15:26.520
It was dispiriting.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.239
Jake?

15:30.240 --> 15:34.359
Chicago. That's where the keys
came from, anyway. To his flat.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.279
Where, astonishingly,
I currently reside.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.159
No note?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.319
Keys were the note.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.720
Kenny, you once suggested to me
that we work together as partners.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.399
It's a cause of not
inconsiderable surprise

15:50.400 --> 15:53.999
that that idea now
makes a sort of sense.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.440
On a business level.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.160
And...on another.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.880
I feel guilt, Kenny.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.999
For the way I treated you.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.040
This is a chance to rectify that.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.120
I've heard you're doing OK.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.280
Now it's time for
you to do even better.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.240
Let me tell you how I've
spent the last two years.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.519
A morning meeting.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.039
The day's graft.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.719
And evenings at Sighthill College.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.279
Now I'm two years dry, I get
the kids every other Saturday

16:37.280 --> 16:38.999
and I've got an HND
in legal services

16:39.000 --> 16:41.279
which, as you and I both know,

16:41.280 --> 16:44.959
means I'm licensed to
produce legal documents.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.400
And you're not.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.079
You're disbarred.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.479
So you want to produce legal
documents on my license,

16:52.480 --> 16:53.679
that's all this is.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.719
There's no guilt.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.920
That's not an emotion
you would entertain.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.799
The HND leaves you somewhat
lacking in legal expertise,

17:03.800 --> 17:06.159
which is why you're working
out of a shithole in Leith

17:06.160 --> 17:08.119
and have made the
catastrophic decision

17:08.120 --> 17:10.679
to name your business
Burns Investigations.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.639
It's my name.
It sounds a little niche.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.679
Oh, we've had the
odd misunderstanding.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.679
Still living in Pilton?
Hamilton Borders.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.240
Remember this moment, Kenny.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.240
This is when your life turns.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.679
Me and you.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.199
Legal services for the
good people of Leith.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.279
Your licence, my knowledge.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.680

17:50.120 --> 17:52.559
This is your last resort, isn't it?

17:52.560 --> 17:54.399
Coming here.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.359
And it's you all over, Max.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.600
Thinking too much of yourself
and too little of me.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.320
What are you saying, Kenny?

18:04.960 --> 18:07.439
I'm saying you're right.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.879
This place needs a bit of work.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.679
So maybe that's where we start.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.640
A wee...trial run.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.200
Good. That'll do you now.

I did.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.599
Yeah.

Hello?

Dad? How are you?

Well...

21:13.280 --> 21:14.640
I'm calling you.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.840
It's good to hear from you.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.200
Shame about the circumstances.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.440
You're hearing from me
because of the circumstances.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.680
Tell me about Adrian's family.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.359
They gave up on him.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.880
Few rehabs ago.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.520
But I presume they'll
come looking eventually.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.039
A police detective will file
a missing persons report

22:20.040 --> 22:23.040
which will say that
Adrian left suddenly.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.480
That he had a troubled private life.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.319
That he took his passport,

22:30.320 --> 22:31.639
emptied his account

22:31.640 --> 22:33.800
and was sighted at the airport.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.560
And why would a policeman do that?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.200
Because I'll suggest he does.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.559
Tell your friends he relapsed,

22:46.560 --> 22:47.960
you kicked him out.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.119
You're sad, but it's
hardly the first time,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.200
and you've got to move on.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.920
And what about...

23:02.800 --> 23:04.120
..the other one?

23:05.320 --> 23:09.120
He has a regimental tattoo
and smells like a brewery.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.159
Ex-Army, full of
drink and owns a gun.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.760
We can make that look...

23:19.680 --> 23:22.480
..the way people would
expect it to look.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.040
The money?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.159
I don't want it.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.559
Not like that you don't.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.999
But cleaned up, legitimate,
it becomes something else.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.560
It becomes enough to
repair the damage he's done.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.439
And to give you a
break from men like him.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.639
I don't want it.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.879
And I don't need it.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.280
Really?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.200
I heard about your business.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.960
And cocaine's expensive.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.120
This isn't going to be what
you hope it's going to be.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.480
I've managed without
you for a long time.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.440
How's that working out?

24:23.480 --> 24:25.840
I couldn't help noticing
when I was down there...

24:28.400 --> 24:31.920
..that the other one hasn't
been dead as long as Adrian.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.400
Are we finished?

24:38.760 --> 24:40.199
Go to bed.

24:40.200 --> 24:44.039
There will be some coming and
going, but you stay up there.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.719
It'll be daylight in three hours.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.599
Give it four for safety.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.800
Then come downstairs
and this is all gone.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.680
A new day.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.120
Thanks.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.639
For calling me.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.920
I don't know anyone else
who does what you do.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.959
You won't believe me, but...

25:10.960 --> 25:12.520
..I don't do this any more.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.720
# The birds they sang

25:40.520 --> 25:43.560
# At the break of day

25:45.120 --> 25:46.480
# Start again

25:49.000 --> 25:50.960
# I heard them say

25:53.720 --> 25:55.280
# Don't dwell

25:57.120 --> 25:59.040
# On what has passed away

26:01.200 --> 26:03.440
# Or what is yet to be

26:09.640 --> 26:11.000
# Ring the bell

26:12.360 --> 26:15.400
# It still can ring

26:18.360 --> 26:23.000
# Forget your perfect offering

26:25.520 --> 26:28.639
# There is a crack

26:28.640 --> 26:31.720
# A crack in everything

26:33.720 --> 26:36.520
# That's how the light gets in... #

26:41.560 --> 26:43.679
Thursdays.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.120
They were the problem.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.359
Because on Thursdays,
I work the same shift as my ex

26:50.360 --> 26:52.240
and I should pick him up.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.959
She's this New-Agey sociopath

26:56.960 --> 26:58.559
so she seemed to think

26:58.560 --> 27:01.279
we were fucking mates or something.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.879
She would always slip
something into the conversation,

27:03.880 --> 27:06.160
and I'd miss it at the time.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.319
Then that night, it would
grow and grow inside me.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.200
And...the only way to...

27:21.880 --> 27:23.200
So I drank.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.039
Then Thursdays got so bad
that, on Friday, I had to drink

27:29.040 --> 27:30.560
just to get past them.

27:32.120 --> 27:36.399
Then the fear of Thursday
took down Wednesday,

27:36.400 --> 27:40.599
but that was a case of
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.120
Less than half the week.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.640
Then my colleague
got promoted over me.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.759
That made Mondays hard.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.160
Going back to that.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.999
So Monday went.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.199
The thought of it took
down Sunday and, I mean...

27:57.200 --> 28:00.159
Tuesday was just sort of hanging
around feeling sorry for herself,

28:00.160 --> 28:02.560
so I put that out its misery.

28:04.360 --> 28:07.679
So that's six days. Not great.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.560
But it was OK.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.400
Because of Saturday.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.519
I ran on Saturdays.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.719
Up Arthur's Seat -
it's, like, ten miles.

28:20.720 --> 28:25.480
Then I came home and I cleaned
and I washed, and I slept.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.760
And it was safe.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.359
Then one Saturday, I was
at the top of Arthur's Seat,

28:39.360 --> 28:41.600
looking out over the city and...

28:42.880 --> 28:45.359
..feeling halfway
good about myself.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.800
And there she was.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.719
My ex's wife.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.639
Tits and Lycra with not
a drop of sweat on her,

28:53.640 --> 28:56.479
and talking about the
healing power of clouds.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.320
And that was Saturday gone.

29:01.720 --> 29:05.439
That was when... That was
when I started drinking in...

29:05.440 --> 29:08.600
..in a way that I had to
take me somewhere, and...

29:10.640 --> 29:11.960
..I'm glad.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.320
I'm glad it took me here.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.119
Thank you.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.800
APPLAUSE

29:30.680 --> 29:32.199
Feel good?

29:32.200 --> 29:33.359
Yeah.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.319
Particularly when I
got to slag her off.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.319
Hmm. That's what this
place is all about.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.880
Slagging folk off and shit coffee.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.599
SHE GIGGLES

29:43.600 --> 29:46.000
Ah, Christ!

29:49.040 --> 29:51.480
Maybe we can meet up, you know?

29:52.840 --> 29:55.279
Not here. Really? I...

29:55.280 --> 29:56.720
Look, I'll be fine.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.479
"Fine"?

30:00.480 --> 30:01.679
Good.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.040
It would be good!

30:28.160 --> 30:31.039
If you put down your deposit...

30:31.040 --> 30:33.000
CONVERSATION CONTINUES

30:35.560 --> 30:38.159
There we go, Max. Honest toil.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.479
Nothing like it.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.559
The work is its own reward.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.200
Conan Doyle said that.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.999
Did you know he grew up in
a flat on Picardy Place?

30:47.000 --> 30:50.239
Yeah. There's a rather
large statue outside of it.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.679
Now, I was thinking
our priorities...

30:52.680 --> 30:54.600
Oh, here we are.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.879
Right. Thought I'd do my
bit to kick us off.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.119
A niche.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.679
That's what we need.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.519
Something to get people's
attention, get them in the door.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.839
And I landed on...

31:08.840 --> 31:10.399
..a brilliant niche.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.479
Wills.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.839
Wills?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.959
£99.99 - a hundred quid will.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.399
Can you imagine it?

31:18.400 --> 31:21.239
It's a hard thing to imagine?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.559
Well, that's just to get them
in the door. You see?

31:23.560 --> 31:26.039
Because when people
think about their wills,

31:26.040 --> 31:27.639
that's when it all comes
tumbling out.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.799
Estrangements, kaput
marriages, money disputes.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.119
So they hear about
our deal on wills, right?

31:32.120 --> 31:35.839
They come in, they take a card...

31:35.840 --> 31:38.159
..and soon enough,
they're back for more.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.959
More paperwork for you to draw up.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.959
A wee bit of the old
investigatory for me.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.399
What...
HE CLEARS THROAT

31:44.400 --> 31:46.879
What's going on here, Kenny?
That's an owl.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.479
I see the owls.
I'd struggle not to see the owls.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.639
The owl, as you should really know,
was the Roman symbol of justice.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.999
They'd have them...

31:54.000 --> 31:55.959
They'd have them caged
in their courtrooms,

31:55.960 --> 31:57.959
which is a wee bit
cruel, right enough but...

31:57.960 --> 32:01.359
My issue with the owls is
that they are so plentiful.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.359
Now, now, Max.
Let's stay positive.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.879
Conan Doyle grew up on a
one-bedder with no shoes on his feet

32:05.880 --> 32:08.600
and a dad in the Royal Asylum,
and look where he got to.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.400
It's a terrible thing, getting old.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.119
All the things you
thought were dealt with,

32:23.120 --> 32:25.119
they come back stronger

32:25.120 --> 32:27.079
just as you get weaker.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.359
And maybe that's it.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.920
Maybe I'm going soft.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.359
Either way, you're right, Max.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.279
I owe you.

32:37.280 --> 32:42.079
A lot of men lose their nerve
in that place, but you didn't. So...

32:42.080 --> 32:43.400
A wee gesture.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.319
And, err...

32:47.320 --> 32:48.720
..a bigger one.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.919
Clean it.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.239
Take your usual cut.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.600
Give it back.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.479
Thought you were legit.

33:09.480 --> 33:10.960
I am. That's why I'm here.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.759
What's this come from?

33:16.760 --> 33:18.880
I'm...I'm not involved in this.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.759
You're looking well, son.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.959
Considering what happened the
last time you were in my vicinity.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.959
Let's keep you looking well.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.239
This isn't help.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.799
Roy...

33:33.800 --> 33:35.240
..this is something else.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.679
I just haven't worked out what yet.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.600
Clean it and give it back.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.879
We're not doing it.
I can clean it in a day.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.359
Our cut would be the first
step to setting up properly.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.319
Up town.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.359
This isn't what this
is going to be, Max.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.359
Me, you - this place isn't
going to be this. I agree.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.239
And it won't be, after this.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.439
The thing about Roy asking
you to do something

34:36.440 --> 34:38.520
is that he isn't really asking.

34:44.240 --> 34:47.480
If he's legit then
the money isn't his.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.519
This looks like the kind of money
that people'll come looking for.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.839
Well, you can't lose.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.280
We clean it or we
get caught with it.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.919
Well, whoever's money it is,

34:59.920 --> 35:01.959
they don't know it's missing yet.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.919
How'd you know that?

35:03.920 --> 35:05.639
Because they're not here.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.080
It's a tracker.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.640
So why don't we see
who comes looking for it?

35:49.000 --> 35:52.159
TV BLARES

35:52.160 --> 35:54.320
PHONE RINGS

35:56.800 --> 35:58.400
HE MUTES TV

36:02.800 --> 36:04.319
Hey!

36:04.320 --> 36:06.040
There's debt I didn't know about.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.959
He's been forging my signature.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.360
Well, at least he had one talent.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.639
If it's safe, I'll take it.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.719
I thought you might.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.840
It's in motion.

36:19.480 --> 36:20.880
How are you doing?

36:44.560 --> 36:46.000
Leith Legals?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.560
Should be busy. You'd think so.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.999
Are you done?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.040
Yeah.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.959
How clean is it?

37:01.960 --> 37:03.600
Spotless.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.279
Send it here.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.359
Not directly.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.360
I know how it works,
I invented how it works.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.520
You're running your
own messages now?

37:22.480 --> 37:24.400
Do you like Westerns, Max?

37:26.120 --> 37:27.560
No? Escape.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.319
That's what they've been
for me since I was a boy.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.719
At the Alhambra.
The foot of the Walk.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.679
Sunday double-bill.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.239
The good stuff, you know?

37:38.240 --> 37:40.719
John Ford, Howard Hawks.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.880
Men that knew their
way around a story.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.919
And I still escape
into these stories,

37:46.920 --> 37:48.640
just like at the Alhambra.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.800
Last night, I couldn't.

37:53.560 --> 37:57.080
Because I kept thinking,
why did you ask me that?

37:58.600 --> 38:01.639
Why did you ask me
where the money was from

38:01.640 --> 38:03.680
when you know how it works?

38:05.920 --> 38:07.600
That was because of him.

38:08.600 --> 38:09.999
Kenny.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.079
It's his license.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.279
I feel...

38:13.280 --> 38:18.479
Ach, I don't know -
I feel responsible for him,

38:18.480 --> 38:20.199
I suppose, to a degree.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.359
Not many men go inside
and come out better.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.279
Well, I couldn't
have come out worse.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.999
Where is he?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.519
AA. So that's what's wrong with him.

38:30.520 --> 38:33.319
I mean, you should've
seen him before.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.919
Do you trust him?

38:34.920 --> 38:36.600
More than I trust you.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.240
DOOR CLOSES

38:55.360 --> 38:57.199
If I'd walked past this
place a few months ago

38:57.200 --> 38:59.439
and seen us sitting here like this,

38:59.440 --> 39:01.159
I'd have thought,

39:01.160 --> 39:03.279
"You fucking bitch."

39:03.280 --> 39:05.559
Sitting here fresh as a
daisy with a peppermint tea

39:05.560 --> 39:08.439
and a good-looking bloke
while I walk to work

39:08.440 --> 39:10.719
because I'm too scared to drive.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.559
I used to feel sorry for people.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.159
Normal people.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.999
I convinced myself they were
all living these empty lives.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.599
Like, I'd be walking about half-cut,

39:20.600 --> 39:22.839
freezing cold because I lost
my jacket three pubs back.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.959
Trying to find the bus fare home.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.079
"Look at all these poor bastards
with their boring lives

39:28.080 --> 39:29.840
"and their nice, warm jackets."

39:32.480 --> 39:34.320
I have to go to work. Same.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.279
Legal services, common practice.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.360
Right.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.320
You don't have to, um...

39:45.440 --> 39:47.280
We...we share what we want to share.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.520
I'd like to do this again.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.920
So would I.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.520
DOORBELL RINGS

40:18.760 --> 40:21.200
The thing about blind trusts...
Do you have a card?

40:26.680 --> 40:30.079
Blind trusts are supposed to
stop conflicts of interest

40:30.080 --> 40:32.679
to maintain purity and honour.

40:32.680 --> 40:37.279
But the law is no
match for humanity.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.439
And so there is another
form of blind trust.

40:40.440 --> 40:44.199
Which is about diversion,
confusion, building a maze.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.159
That's what they tried to
do with your blind trust,

40:47.160 --> 40:49.359
but they didn't do it very well,

40:49.360 --> 40:51.479
which is why I know it's yours.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.679
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.359
You're the sole beneficiary
of a blind trust stuck together

40:57.360 --> 41:00.560
by a bunch of hack lawyers working
for a man called Roy Lynch.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.479
I see.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.399
Is he an associate of yours?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.039
No, he's not.

41:07.040 --> 41:09.279
I didn't think so.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.799
Is your husband home?

41:10.800 --> 41:12.080
No.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.240
I used to have a house like this.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.879
They come with pressure.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.959
The kind of pressure that
might lead your husband

41:21.960 --> 41:23.879
into hiding things in your name.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.599
The kind of pressure that
might send him to Roy Lynch.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.519
We're separated.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.919
This is my house.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.319
So tell me, in what capacity
are you here in my house

41:33.320 --> 41:35.439
asking me these things?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.479
I'm setting up the trust.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.760
This is my due diligence, making
sure everything's above board.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.719
Should I speak to the police?

41:43.720 --> 41:45.839
Lothian Police?

41:45.840 --> 41:49.679
Christ, they couldn't get
a cat out of a tree!

41:49.680 --> 41:51.519
HE FORCES A LAUGHS

41:51.520 --> 41:54.999
No, no, no. I'll, eh,
sort this out myself.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.080
You're a long way from Leith.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.199
And your owl sanctuary.

42:00.200 --> 42:03.199
My partner designed those cards.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.999
He's an alcoholic.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.719
Thanks for your time.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.679
# What moves you
to act the way you are?

42:11.680 --> 42:15.959
# What moves you
to fall into their arms?

42:15.960 --> 42:20.239
# What moves you
to wish each other harm?

42:20.240 --> 42:24.679
# What moves you
to act the way you are?

42:24.680 --> 42:28.959
# What moves
when you beat each other down?

42:28.960 --> 42:33.119
# What moves
when you act the way you are?

42:33.120 --> 42:37.679
# What moves you to
fall into their arms?

42:37.680 --> 42:42.479
# What moves you to
beat each other down? #

42:42.480 --> 42:44.320
MUSIC CONTINUES

43:18.840 --> 43:22.079
You diddle me with your dealing.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.960
I don't know how you do it,
but you diddle me.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.800
I called him.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.120
Dad.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.920
I saw him. I'm sorry.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.399
You must have been desperate.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.560
It won't happen again.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.719
Just because I don't
have anything to do with him

43:47.720 --> 43:49.879
doesn't mean you shouldn't.
He's got his uses.

43:49.880 --> 43:51.560
I don't. It was just...

43:52.880 --> 43:54.680
It won't happen again.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.399
But you'll be pleased to
hear that Adrian's gone.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.079
Oh.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.119
How can you tell me that, love,

44:06.120 --> 44:08.480
and expect my old heart to take it?

44:09.760 --> 44:13.239
He wasn't...wasn't a
bad man under it all.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.839
Under the trousers.

44:15.840 --> 44:18.519
What kind of Scotsman
rises in the morning

44:18.520 --> 44:20.999
and decides that
his very best option

44:21.000 --> 44:24.319
is to spend the day cutting about
town in a pair of red trousers?

44:24.320 --> 44:25.719
Well, I'm happy you're happy.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.719
It's all right to aim upwards, love.

44:27.720 --> 44:29.599
God knows I wish I had,

44:29.600 --> 44:31.519
but you don't have
to settle for that.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.879
Can you move in
with me now, Mum? No.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.279
Here, I'm just about bearable.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.640
There, I'd be a pain in the arse.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.240
It won't happen again.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.119
Can you write these up, Yvonne?

44:53.120 --> 44:55.399
Sorry, I've been up
to my ears all day.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.719
I'll be here all night.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.840
Well, that'll keep
you out of trouble.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.719
How's it going,
with the other thing?

45:06.720 --> 45:08.319
Fine, thanks.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.080
And you're being careful?

45:12.120 --> 45:14.759
Well, in this job, anything
like that, any weakness,

45:14.760 --> 45:16.799
folk can use it against you.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.840
I'm aware of that, Stevie.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.799
I'm being careful.

45:23.800 --> 45:26.040
Well done, pal.
I'm...I'm proud of you.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.759
It's safe, anonymous.

45:34.760 --> 45:37.559
Withdraw what you need
when you need to.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.239
Who's done this?

45:39.240 --> 45:40.560
My team.

45:43.360 --> 45:46.279
A lot of demand for blind
trusts in Leith, is there?

45:46.280 --> 45:47.880
We're not in Leith any more.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.839
But it's not...

45:50.840 --> 45:55.639
..what it was, it's...it's
legal work, uptown.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.719
We've got a view of the castle.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.599
From the toilet window,
right enough,

46:00.600 --> 46:02.760
but it's a view all the same.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.120
You're not taking my money.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.519
You're getting something out of him,

46:13.520 --> 46:15.719
a silver lining,

46:15.720 --> 46:17.599
for what he took from you,

46:17.600 --> 46:19.760
for what he made you do.

46:21.720 --> 46:24.160
I spent so much time trying
to get away from you.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.520
And here I fucking am.

46:30.720 --> 46:33.600
Growing up in this city
with my name...

46:34.880 --> 46:39.039
..if you've been a boy,
you'd have maybe been proud,

46:39.040 --> 46:40.959
or a wee bit gallus with it,

46:40.960 --> 46:42.920
but you were embarrassed.

46:44.520 --> 46:46.919
You thought running away from
me would make life easier,

46:46.920 --> 46:48.920
but you got that backwards.

46:50.840 --> 46:53.640
You should have embraced who I am.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.840
Because that's who you are.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.199
People used to say to me,

47:02.200 --> 47:05.799
"Do you wish you had a boy
to pass it onto?" But...

47:05.800 --> 47:08.519
..but it's not about
sons and daughters.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.320
It's deeper than that.
It's about what's inside.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.760
And you're forged from steel, Erin.

47:17.320 --> 47:21.079
I saw it in you from
when you were a wee girl.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.319
And I see it now.

47:23.320 --> 47:27.439
And I saw it when I was down
those stairs back there,

47:27.440 --> 47:31.199
thinking about what I told
you when you were young,

47:31.200 --> 47:33.399
that we don't call the police

47:33.400 --> 47:36.560
and how that's still
there inside you.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.880
You are me.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.760
And I'm getting old.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.240
And there is a kingdom.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.200
And it requires an heir.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.360
Thanks for the money.

48:06.440 --> 48:08.320
I'm watching you, son.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.519
Sorry? I'm watching you.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.159
Scouting around,

48:14.160 --> 48:16.479
picking off stragglers.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.319
What are you suggesting?

48:18.320 --> 48:20.279
It's the weak ones, isn't it?

48:20.280 --> 48:23.119
I mean, we're all weak,
but even then,

48:23.120 --> 48:25.759
I saw you hitting Moira's yesterday.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.759
She's half cooked wi' dementia.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.919
What can you be peddling
that's going to help her?

48:29.920 --> 48:31.599
I'm not peddling anything.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.199
I'm offering a highly
attractive property investment

48:34.200 --> 48:38.439
that will offer financial security
to some of your fellow residents.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.520
The new flats at Leith.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.159
They're yours to sell, are they?

48:44.160 --> 48:45.719
Yeah.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.240
Which means I'm busy.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.680
Which means wind
your fucking neck in.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.120
Best of luck to you, son.

What do you think?

50:05.640 --> 50:07.119
What's that?

50:07.120 --> 50:10.079
Well, he's filed a missing person
but he's cocked up the registration.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.959
Hmm. Been too long out
the trenches, that one.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.479
What's he doing his
own filing for, anyway?

50:15.480 --> 50:18.200
I don't know. Here.
I'll enter it again.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.120
How'd he get it?

50:23.800 --> 50:26.599
The DI position over you.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.440
He used what he had.

50:31.040 --> 50:36.039
# It tastes good with the money

50:36.040 --> 50:40.679
# I'll never look at a tower block

50:40.680 --> 50:44.879
# The same way again

50:44.880 --> 50:48.519
# Mm, mm

50:48.520 --> 50:53.040
# It tastes good with the money

50:55.200 --> 50:58.719
# And one more faith

50:58.720 --> 51:04.159
# Bursting into flames

51:04.160 --> 51:06.519
# The air up there
Now fresh and clean... #

51:06.520 --> 51:09.359
He'd no' have done it.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.920
Suicide.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.359
Coward's way out.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.799
He wisnae a coward.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.600
That's what I'm saying!

51:23.040 --> 51:30.040
# Sketching ruins in the dark. #

51:32.720 --> 51:34.040
HE PANTS

51:38.520 --> 51:40.000
Nice dog.

51:44.640 --> 51:49.919
In 1588, a ship from the
Spanish Armada was wrecked on Skye,

51:49.920 --> 51:53.000
and the only survivors
were three white dogs.

51:54.760 --> 51:57.519
Clan Donald took them, fed them,

51:57.520 --> 51:59.799
kept them away from
the local mongrels

51:59.800 --> 52:01.920
and bred them for centuries.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.519
They called them
West Highland Terriers,

52:06.520 --> 52:09.560
and they kept them
a secret for 200 years.

52:11.440 --> 52:14.760
You can keep anything secret
if you work hard enough.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.840
Someone told me yesterday
I wasn't capable of guilt.

52:26.680 --> 52:28.359
And he was right.

52:28.360 --> 52:30.799
Feelings like that -

52:30.800 --> 52:34.519
guilt, love, happiness -

52:34.520 --> 52:36.360
they don't touch the sides.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.159
I've always needed something...

52:41.160 --> 52:43.040
..more, something deeper.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.399
When I was young, it was fear.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.999
Fear of being found out,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.999
being discovered in worlds
I didn't belong in,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.320
I didn't have the breeding for.

53:01.800 --> 53:04.200
Then fear turned to greed.

53:08.080 --> 53:10.520
And that did a decent
job for me, too.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.519
In prison,

53:15.520 --> 53:17.720
those first few weeks...

53:20.960 --> 53:22.480
..I was lost.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.480
I was twisting in the wind.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.640
I tried guilt, don't get me wrong.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.360
How could I not?

53:42.720 --> 53:45.919
Late at night,
lying in a cell in the dark,

53:45.920 --> 53:47.400
you'll try anything.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.599
But it didn't work,

53:55.600 --> 53:58.799
because guilt's about looking back

53:58.800 --> 54:01.199
and what I needed,
what I've always needed

54:01.200 --> 54:03.840
is something that can help me now.

54:05.280 --> 54:07.240
Something to drive me.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.080
Something to grant me purpose.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.400
Because a man like me...

54:20.840 --> 54:22.920
..he needs something to draw on.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.320
A man like me, he needs some...

54:29.000 --> 54:30.720
..heavy fuel.

54:32.680 --> 54:34.600
And then you came to see me.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.160
And I found it.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.879
What I needed.

54:41.880 --> 54:44.039
Thank God.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.840
I found it.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.320
Revenge.

55:06.760 --> 55:08.520
It's revenge.

55:10.480 --> 55:13.440
MUSIC: Into The Valley
by The Skids

55:33.160 --> 55:36.359
# Into the valley

55:36.360 --> 55:39.479
# Betrothed and divine

55:39.480 --> 55:41.159
# Realisation's no virtue

55:41.160 --> 55:42.879
# But who can define

55:42.880 --> 55:44.439
# Why soldiers go marching?

55:44.440 --> 55:46.199
# Those masses in line

55:46.200 --> 55:49.159
# This disease is catching

55:49.160 --> 55:52.519
# From victory to stone

55:52.520 --> 55:53.959
# Ahoy! Ahoy!

55:53.960 --> 55:55.799
# Land, sea and sky

55:55.800 --> 55:57.639
# Ahoy! Ahoy!

55:57.640 --> 55:59.159
# Boy, man and soldier

55:59.160 --> 56:02.360
# Ahoy! Ahoy!
Deceived and then punctured. #
