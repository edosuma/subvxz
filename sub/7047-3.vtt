00:02.586 --> 00:03.920
Previously on Justified...

00:04.003 --> 00:06.172
I'm gonna reassign you.
Eastern District of Kentucky.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.925
I grew up in Kentucky.
I don't wanna go back there.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.596
A bit of a comedown from the Miami office,
I'd expect.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.766
Not with you here.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.559
Good to see you.

00:18.811 --> 00:21.896
- Tell me about the shooting.
- It was justified.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.109
You concerned
about me coming down here?

00:26.610 --> 00:27.944
It's a small office, Raylan.

00:30.322 --> 00:33.950
- You seen your daddy yet?
- No. Not yet.

00:34.326 --> 00:37.203
Boy, he was a wild man back in his day,
wasn't he?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.789
What was that scam he had going
back in the early '90s?

00:39.873 --> 00:43.000
Stealing mining machinery,
selling it to the Colombians,

00:43.085 --> 00:45.294
getting paid in cocaine?
You remember that?

00:46.630 --> 00:47.630
Guess I was gone by then.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.048
Raylan!

00:49.133 --> 00:52.760
- You remember me, huh?
- I never forgot you.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.898
I can't sleep with you, Ava.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.824
Raylan.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.538
I got a courtesy call from the Harlan
County Sheriff's Department this morning.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.373
Your daddy's been arrested.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.875
He kill anybody?

01:25.753 --> 01:26.919
DUI.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.714
Sounds like it's not the first time.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.842
All right. Thanks, Art.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.682
Is there something else?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.769
Well, they left a number in case
you wanted to give him a message

01:42.853 --> 01:45.730
or get an update on how he's doing.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.025
He's fine. I'm sure he's feeling right at home.

01:53.697 --> 02:00.536
Just out of curiosity, is he a knucklehead,
your daddy, or is he a real bad guy?

02:00.621 --> 02:04.081
You gonna pretend like you didn't pull
his sheet soon as that call came in?

02:05.751 --> 02:08.044
Well, it's not every day
that I run across a man

02:08.127 --> 02:10.378
who's been a leg breaker and a grifter.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.049
Yeah. He's done time for both.
So, what does that tell you?

02:13.217 --> 02:16.260
His sheet tells me that the thing
that kept tripping him up

02:16.386 --> 02:20.765
in both his chosen professions
was a tendency to ill temper.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.559
It's a good thing he didn't pass that on.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.311
Isn't it, though?

02:31.235 --> 02:35.238
- Hey. Art tell you about the phone calls?
- He told you?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.615
- What are you talking about?
- Wait, what are you talking about?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.158
The phone calls. Arnold Pinter.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.701
Who's Arnold Pinter?

02:40.786 --> 02:45.164
He's a snitch. Actually,
as of this moment, he's your snitch.

02:46.250 --> 02:50.628
One of the ways we welcome new deputies
around here is having them handle Pinter.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.714
For the last nine months,
that honor has fallen to Deputy Gutterson.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.342
Today he passes the torch on to you.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.803
Yeah. So, this is some kind of hazing thing,

02:58.929 --> 03:01.764
like the way a rookie's got to carry
a veteran's bags on the road?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.933
Don't worry. You'll be carrying my bag.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.603
I've been doing this 17 years.
I don't think that qualifies me as a rookie.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.356
Hey, you tell Pinter I said hi.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.957
Excuse me. I'm looking for a...

03:42.055 --> 03:45.182
- Mr. Pinter?
- Hey, at your service.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.643
Is there somewhere you want to talk?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.146
Are you my new Marshal?

03:50.981 --> 03:55.318
I know it's called Confidential Informant,
but I ain't got no time for confidential.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.611
They didn't tell you?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.738
See, I'm too busy trying
to get enough money together

03:58.822 --> 04:02.950
to get my ass the hell out of this inbred,
squeal-like-a-pig backwater.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.536
- No offense.
- No, none taken.

04:05.662 --> 04:09.248
And, yes, they did.
Doesn't seem like a safe way to live.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.710
- Hey, what in this life, huh? Am I right?
- Well...

04:12.836 --> 04:14.921
Deputy Gutterson
couldn't get used to it, either.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.839
He says hi, by the way.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.423
Samantha!

04:19.676 --> 04:22.887
I'll take another fizz,
and one for Deputy Marshal...

04:23.013 --> 04:24.597
Givens.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.600
- One for Deputy Givens.
- I'm fine. Thank you.

04:27.684 --> 04:32.647
Actually, I would like
some vanilla ice cream. Thanks.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.023
You know what you're missing?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.233
You ever have a chocolate egg cream?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.444
Not that I can recall.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.865
I taught Jimmy how to make them.
It's like drinking Brooklyn. In a good way.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.869
- How long you been in Kentucky?
- Twelve long years, brother.

04:46.954 --> 04:51.207
See, back in the '90s,
times were tough in New York.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.584
Russians, Jamaicans were muscling in.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.628
Jamaicans, they had
this thing called "jointing,"

04:55.754 --> 04:59.256
where they'd saw through a guy at every
joint and leave pieces of him in the street.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.300
See, I could always work with the Italians,

05:01.385 --> 05:03.886
but how you gonna do business
with people like that?

05:05.222 --> 05:09.767
- And what kind of business are you in?
- You know, little of this, little of that.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.894
You know what a fixer is?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.605
Yeah. It's a local guy who works
with foreign reporters?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.316
Very good. I'm a big cable-news guy.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.987
Kept hearing about these guys
who work with news crews,

05:21.071 --> 05:24.240
getting them info, transpo,
security, even girls.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.200
Got me thinking about the old days,

05:26.284 --> 05:28.494
where a guy could support himself
just making book.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.748
Here in the hinterlands, you got to diversify.

05:32.916 --> 05:37.086
But why here? It seems like a lot
of places that could use a bookie.

05:37.295 --> 05:44.176
Now you tell me! I don't know,
I guess I figured the climate, the lifestyle.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.344
The lifestyle?

05:45.429 --> 05:46.846
See, I started out in Miami,

05:46.930 --> 05:49.682
but not only do they have
their own Russians and Jamaicans,

05:49.766 --> 05:52.852
they've got boatlifters
and every other goddamn bunch,

05:52.936 --> 05:54.854
and the only thing that they got in common

05:54.938 --> 05:57.148
is they all like slicing up people
with machetes.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.651
Here it is! Beautiful. All right.
You got to at least try a sip.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.320
- You won't be sorry.
- No, no, no. That's fine.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.284
Thank you, doll.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.957
- Yeah, that's fantastic. Thank you.
- Good for you.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.671
Oh, shit. Givens. Miami.

06:20.797 --> 06:25.468
You're the guy who pulled a Wild Bill
on that guy at the Delano.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.844
See? Cable news.

06:26.970 --> 06:27.970
- Mr. Pinter?
- Yeah?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.639
Do you have any information
that may be of interest

06:30.724 --> 06:32.641
to the United States Marshals Service?

06:36.313 --> 06:39.356
Isaac "Tiny" Winfield.
Fourteen arrests since '01.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.193
Felony assault, menacing,
making terroristic threats.

06:42.319 --> 06:46.113
Convicted twice. Last time was
in Tennessee. Did three years in Riverbend.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.616
Attempted murder,
pled down to aggravated assault.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.952
November last year, gets busted in Memphis
for stomping a nightclub owner.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.622
Escapes Memphis PD custody.
Been in the wind since.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.501
Wanted on various charges,
including federal parole violation.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.835
Where did he escape from?

07:00.045 --> 07:03.005
Back of a squad car.
Pulled his shackles apart,

07:03.090 --> 07:06.050
kicked in the barrier,
and put two officers in the ICU.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.969
- "Pulled his shackles apart"?
- Yeah, that's what it says.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.931
Why do I get the feeling "Tiny"
is meant to be ironic?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.476
- Oh, my God.
- What does it say, he a big 'un?

07:15.560 --> 07:18.687
- Shit.
- Textbook shakedown psycho.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.774
You figure he's muscling Pinter,
so Pinter dimed him to us?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.359
That would be nice and linear.

07:23.527 --> 07:27.404
- 20G reward ain't bad, either.
- And this woman that Pinter gave you...

07:32.369 --> 07:34.203
- Sherese Mason.
- Sherese.

07:34.371 --> 07:38.082
- Nothing in the file about Tiny having a wife.
- She's his common-law wife.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.291
How long do we sit on her?

07:40.544 --> 07:44.088
Well, Pinter said that Tiny moves
around a lot, but sooner or later,

07:44.214 --> 07:45.381
comes back to Sherese.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.222
We're taking the door.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.646
US Marshals! Search warrant!
Open the door or we'll break it down!

08:02.232 --> 08:04.441
- Let me see your hands!
- Here are my hands, bobo chota.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.026
- Who else you got in here?
- I'm not enough?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.403
- Where's Tiny?
- He's not here.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.322
Mamacita, if he's here and we find him,
you are going to jail.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.076
He's in the bedroom.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.413
You won't need all that.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.755
That's just wrong.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.755
Hey. Egg cream?

09:08.423 --> 09:12.218
Nah, man. I'm off sugar.
Got to keep this gut in check.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.012
Hey, it's a real shame the way
you've been letting yourself go these days.

09:15.639 --> 09:20.017
Yeah. So, I hear Tiny's in town
working on his gorilla act.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.479
- That's what you're calling me for?
- I can handle Tiny.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.648
What, you gonna sic the Marshals on him?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.900
This new guy that they assigned me,

09:27.984 --> 09:30.694
guy dressed just like a cowboy,
boots and everything?

09:30.820 --> 09:35.115
Turns out he's the guy
who outdrew that gun thug in Miami.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.786
Actually, that time he had the hat on.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.496
- It was on the news.
- Yeah.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.416
I don't watch the news too much lately.
I'm busy trying to make this paper.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.918
Know what I'm talking about?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.711
Are you still trying to get
the scratch together

09:47.837 --> 09:50.089
for that carpet-cleaning business?

09:50.173 --> 09:52.049
- Landscaping.
- Right.

09:52.467 --> 09:56.470
You think about that offer I made to you
about being a ground-floor investor?

09:56.846 --> 10:00.391
Yeah, sorry. But I do have a way
for you to make some paper.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.602
Guy's name is Travis Travers.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.854
What's that? Is he a porn star or something?

10:05.981 --> 10:09.358
No. He's just a scumbag playboy
who doesn't honor his markers.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.861
- That's his real name?
- As far as I know.

10:13.029 --> 10:17.324
- How deep is he in?
- $15,000. $16,500 with the vig.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.869
Turns out this guy's been calling in bets
under three different names.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.039
Always calling around 6:00,
7:00 in the morning,

10:24.165 --> 10:26.375
when he's sure that the runners
were covering the phones.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.337
He bet a nickel three times
on the Grizzlies giving 3.5.

10:30.422 --> 10:34.883
Didn't have the sense to pay for a half point.
Not that it would have made a difference.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.510
You know where this Travers live at?

10:36.594 --> 10:40.931
Yeah. He lives in one of those
old Tudors in Ashland Park.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.850
I think his parents left it to him.

10:42.934 --> 10:47.396
Well, it sounds like it shouldn't be too much
problem for him to get the money up.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.358
Hey, hope you don't think that means that
I'm gonna give you no discount, though.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.737
No, of course not! No.
Just bring me my $15,000.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.073
You keep the juice and go buy yourself
a nice, new weed wacker.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.534
That's what I'm talking about.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.078
- Pleasure, as always.
- All right.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.378
Well, he creeps me out.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.714
That's his job.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.258
Sending him after Travis?

11:17.802 --> 11:19.261
Think he's up to it?

11:30.398 --> 11:33.150
Wow. What's Miami like?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.819
Biggest Marshals Office I ever saw.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.113
How about outside the Marshals Office?

11:40.283 --> 11:42.368
- Sunny.
- Thanks.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.121
Miami is a sunny place for shady people.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.956
I'm gonna go there someday.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.126
- Really?
- I got a list of places.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.628
Like?

11:52.837 --> 11:57.591
- Costa Rica. You been there?
- No. I went to Nicaragua once.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.803
- Was it wonderful?
- Actually, no. Not so much.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.185
- How did you meet Winona?
- Here we go.

12:10.188 --> 12:13.524
I was working a prison transport
in Salt Lake City.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.984
That's not one of the places on my list.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.987
Salt Lake's a pretty city.

12:19.114 --> 12:23.659
Mountains all around and... Anyway,
I was sitting at this bar, and I was thinking,

12:24.494 --> 12:26.161
not only does my beer taste like water,

12:26.287 --> 12:28.622
but there was no one around
I wanted to drink it with.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.667
Then this court reporter sits next to me.

12:34.212 --> 12:38.132
Soon as she started talking,
I could tell she was from Kentucky.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.217
So you've got a weakness for Kentucky girls.

12:40.343 --> 12:44.012
Well, it didn't hurt that she was
the most beautiful woman I ever saw.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.266
- Ever?
- Up to that point.

12:47.350 --> 12:52.104
Nice save. Is that why you
come back here for her?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.522
No. I got sent here,

12:53.898 --> 12:56.525
I think because they knew it was
the one place I didn't want to go.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.570
In fact,

13:00.905 --> 13:05.033
as I recall, Winona and I promised
each other we'd never come back here.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.203
Yet here we are.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.331
And yet here we are.

13:13.585 --> 13:17.671
Not long, though.
As soon as I can get reassigned, I am gone.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.507
Well, I'm thinking about going, too.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.677
Is that right?

13:24.888 --> 13:27.556
Turned out there's nothing here for me.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.267
Ava.

13:30.894 --> 13:35.481
I know, I know. It is not me. It's you.

13:35.565 --> 13:40.569
It's a damn shame, though.
We could have had some fun.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.554
Say, Travis,

14:08.264 --> 14:11.391
a little bit of landscaping,
this place wouldn't be half bad.

14:12.769 --> 14:16.438
- That a fact?
- Yeah. I used to be a gardener.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.023
Is that right?

14:18.107 --> 14:22.486
What you do now, besides watch
people tan and critique their yards?

14:22.946 --> 14:25.906
Arnold Pinter asked me to come over here.
You know what I'm talking about?

14:26.950 --> 14:28.784
I got a pretty good idea.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.579
You want to call him, see if he sent me
over here to pick up what you owe?

14:32.664 --> 14:35.832
No. That's all right.
Five grand on the Memphis game, right?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.043
Nah. That's not right.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.879
You bet five three times
under different names.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.423
That's $15,000, $18,000 with the juice.

14:43.508 --> 14:50.138
Now, actually, 10% vig on $15,000 is $1,500,

14:50.640 --> 14:53.267
which makes $16,500, not $18,000.

14:53.601 --> 14:58.313
Nah, but you're forgetting my expenses.
Driving over here, the price of gas is way up.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.484
Actually, the price of gas is going down.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.612
See, I'm big into current events.
Pinter and me, we got that in common.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.614
Let me ask you a question.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.410
Is it the weed that makes you so cool,

15:11.494 --> 15:14.955
or is it the fact that you think
that I ain't serious?

15:15.623 --> 15:21.336
No, I'm pretty sure you're serious.
The problem is, I ain't got $18,000.

15:21.462 --> 15:25.048
Matter of fact, I ain't even got
the $16,500 I actually owe.

15:25.174 --> 15:30.387
- How you afford this cush?
- I grow it out back.

15:30.513 --> 15:34.683
- Did you want a hit or... Whatever.
- How much this place worth?

15:36.019 --> 15:38.895
- This market?
- Yeah.

15:39.022 --> 15:43.567
- Point is, 18's not so bad.
- Look, man, my parents left me this place.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.862
I've already sold off half the furniture
to pay the property taxes.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.031
You watch the news?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.950
- I told you, current events.
- Okay.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.286
Well, then, you know that
we got people in this country

15:54.370 --> 15:56.371
that are living out of cardboard boxes

15:56.497 --> 15:59.583
who still manage to supply
their grand-a-week drug habits.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.503
I'm more into, like, international.

16:03.588 --> 16:09.384
Point is, I'm betting that if you needed to,
you can come up with the money.

16:09.510 --> 16:15.349
Now, I told you that I used to be a gardener,
learned grounds beautification in Angola.

16:16.726 --> 16:21.229
Thing I loved doing the most was pruning,

16:22.440 --> 16:24.775
kind of like you need around here.

16:24.901 --> 16:29.196
So, I'm saying, if you don't come up
with the $18,000 by, say,

16:29.572 --> 16:33.742
day after tomorrow, then I'm gonna start
pruning things on you.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.454
I'm gonna start with your ear and then
maybe your fingers and your toes,

16:37.580 --> 16:39.790
and we'll see where that leads.

16:41.125 --> 16:45.045
You know, what's funny is that
experts say that torture don't really work.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.381
It does when I do it.

16:47.799 --> 16:51.968
All right! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.
Let's say you didn't have to settle for $1,500.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.970
- I told you my cut's $3,000.
- $3,000.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.473
What if I told you
you can get 10 or 20 times that much?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.602
Okay, I'm listening.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.192
So you think he didn't know
about the reward money?

17:07.276 --> 17:10.654
- I thought that's what you thought.
- No. I just said he didn't mention it.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.116
Arnold Pinter would not half-ass
his due diligence.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.703
That's what I figured, especially when
there's 20 grand in there for him.

17:17.787 --> 17:22.124
- Yeah. So you're thinking what I'm thinking.
- Which is what?

17:24.919 --> 17:25.961
Sorry.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.630
Initial there and there
and sign at the bottom.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.883
Now, Raylan, be careful.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.137
Rachel and Tim think that
this guy's a joke, but he's not.

17:35.304 --> 17:40.016
He's a stone-cold flimflam man,
and if you let him, he will pull your strings.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.354
At least he doesn't make excuses
for himself.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.649
Distinguishes him from
the other conmen I've known.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.378
- Excuse me. You seen Pinter?
- Nope.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.549
- You been here all morning?
- Yep.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.509
Any idea where I can find him?

18:15.178 --> 18:19.598
Probably woke up with a cold this morning.
It's not like he has to call in sick.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.808
- Yeah. He was here yesterday?
- And the day before.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.519
So, every day since I last saw him.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.272
Well, will you do me a favor?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.191
- Will you ask him to call Deputy...
- Givens.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.568
I remember.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.529
Thank you.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.371
Wasn't there.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.957
Well, let's sign it back in,

18:46.042 --> 18:49.544
and we'll keep it here tonight
and you can try it again tomorrow.

18:50.129 --> 18:54.382
Well, it seems odd to you, right, him
not being there to collect his reward money?

18:54.467 --> 18:58.470
- Well, you know how flaky these CI's are.
- Yeah.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.138
Plus, you said yourself

19:00.223 --> 19:02.766
that you didn't even know
if he knew there was a reward.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.810
No. I thought you said that.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.020
- I wouldn't say that.
- In fact, I saw him the other day.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.939
All he could talk about was grabbing
all the cash he could

19:09.065 --> 19:10.398
to get the hell out of Kentucky.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.067
Are you sure that was him talking?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.444
That's funny.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.655
Look, if he wants his money,
he'll be in touch.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.198
Well, I guess so.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.576
But something's
making my neck hair stand up.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.203
Well, far be it from me

19:23.287 --> 19:27.249
to second-guess your neck hair,
but don't spend a lot of time on it.

19:32.338 --> 19:36.007
Laurie, can you get me an address
for a CI named Arnold Pinter?

19:36.259 --> 19:40.470
- Sure. Pinter with a "P."
- Arnold Pinter.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.973
10-4. I'm gonna get it.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.365
How you doing? Is Pinter here?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.285
- Who?
- Arnold Pinter.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.830
- This is his house, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course it is.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.290
You live here, too?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.669
No. I just watch the place while he's away.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.004
What's your name?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.381
Travis Travers.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.341
You putting me on?

20:18.801 --> 20:22.053
- You want to see my driver's license?
- Sure.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.973
Yeah, okay. Here you go.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.144
Well, look at that.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.774
Can I get my wallet back?

20:34.859 --> 20:36.568
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.361
Where's Pinter?

20:38.487 --> 20:42.324
Vacation. Yeah, Florida. Key Largo.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.659
He's been gone all week, so...

20:45.077 --> 20:46.161
About a week?

20:48.164 --> 20:49.247
When's he due back?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.335
He didn't tell me.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.670
You mind if I go inside?

20:57.590 --> 21:01.009
- You a friend of Arnold's?
- Yeah. Something like that. Do you mind?

21:02.511 --> 21:05.013
Knock yourself out.
But, hey, I got places I got to be,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.556
so go ahead and close the door
when you leave,

21:06.682 --> 21:08.558
and I'll come back, lock up later.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.060
All righty.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.730
Hey. I think we got a problem.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.401
What kind of problem?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.196
Travis Travers. Local boy.
Grew up in Ashland Park.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.282
Arrested for pandering, contributing
to delinquency, and gambling.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.868
Served 18 months for statutory rape.

22:08.953 --> 22:12.372
Sex offender registry lists
his parents' place as his LKA,

22:12.456 --> 22:15.542
although there's a note here
says the IRS has put a lien on it.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.003
Is that the kind of guy
you'd want watching your house?

22:18.462 --> 22:20.130
I live in an apartment.

22:20.423 --> 22:24.634
No roommates, though.
Thank God. It's... No cats.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.470
You mind telling me,
with the deficit being what it is,

22:27.596 --> 22:30.348
why you're so hot
to spend Uncle Sam's 20 grand?

22:30.433 --> 22:31.599
You said I could look.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.979
I said you could follow your hunch,
see what's goosing your neck hair.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.814
Did you find anything?

22:39.525 --> 22:40.900
Not yet.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.737
So, you ain't get a chance
to search the house?

22:43.821 --> 22:47.407
No. The cop showed up. I told you.
Why you keep asking me that?

22:47.491 --> 22:51.327
I'm just trying to see if you got balls enough
to make up this story

22:51.454 --> 22:54.873
and find the money in the house
and act like a cop interrupted you.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.500
- He didn't badge you or nothing?
- I told you, no.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.627
Yeah, well, how you know he's a cop?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.547
The way he acted, all entitled-like.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.925
Though I never seen a Lexington cop
dressed up like the Marlboro Man.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.385
Ain't like it's Dallas.

23:09.221 --> 23:13.725
You say he was dressed up
like the Marlboro Man, like a cowboy?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.019
Yeah. So?

23:16.145 --> 23:18.354
Well, that Marlboro Man was the Marshal

23:18.481 --> 23:22.192
that Gary Coopered up some badass
in Miami a few weeks ago.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.694
Remember seeing anything
about that, Mr. Current Events?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.280
Maybe.

23:28.783 --> 23:31.284
Yes. Shit.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.913
- What's a federal cop want with Pinter?
- Are you serious?

23:35.456 --> 23:37.749
Pinter's been snitching
to the Marshals for years.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.628
Excuse me?

23:41.712 --> 23:43.963
Don't you think you could have told me that
before we grabbed him?

23:44.048 --> 23:46.925
Hey, I thought you knew. Everybody knows.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.968
All right. So, what are we gonna do now?
He knows my name.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.430
Well, ain't nobody tell you to tell him
your real name. That's just stupid.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.892
Even if I hadn't, he saw my car.
So what if he shows up here?

23:55.976 --> 23:59.729
Hey, when he outdrew on the guy,
did he face off on him first?

24:00.106 --> 24:01.815
I don't know. What if he did?

24:02.233 --> 24:04.317
I don't know. I was just wondering
what that would be like,

24:04.401 --> 24:07.320
you know, all cowboy-movie style.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.697
We need to focus.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.955
Why hasn't he coughed it up yet?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.541
Looks like it's pruning time.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.377
Nah. I can't do that.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.629
What do you mean?

24:25.172 --> 24:28.800
Pinter's been too decent to me.
I wouldn't feel right cutting up on him.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.970
- Well, you were ready to do it to me.
- Yeah. That's different.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.765
Besides, you the one that said
that torture don't work.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.852
Well, riddle me this,
if you're not the intimidator,

24:38.936 --> 24:41.855
then exactly what role
are you playing on this team?

24:42.565 --> 24:46.151
The "keep from killing your punk ass" role.
Now, you got any more riddles?

24:49.446 --> 24:51.156
It's time to accelerate the situation.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.999
Oh, God, please!

25:02.585 --> 25:04.294
So, you see where this goes?

25:04.628 --> 25:06.337
- I can guess.
- Please, Arnold!

25:06.463 --> 25:09.757
- Just give them what they want!
- Yeah, Arnold, time to give it up!

25:11.218 --> 25:14.637
- Oh, God! Arnold!
- All right. Hey.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.931
Hey, Curtis, knock yourself out.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.184
Enjoy!

25:19.810 --> 25:21.477
I think you got the wrong idea.

25:23.105 --> 25:27.358
Travis, cut the shit
and take the stupid masks off.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.862
- He knows.
- Do you think so?

25:30.946 --> 25:37.076
Shit. All right.
Doesn't change much, though, does it?

25:37.161 --> 25:40.496
Now, I get why you don't mind
if he starts cutting pieces off you,

25:41.832 --> 25:45.084
but are you really gonna let him do it to her?

25:45.961 --> 25:47.587
You know, like I just said,

25:49.089 --> 25:50.506
knock yourself out.

25:50.591 --> 25:53.593
You son of a bitch!
I thought you cared about me!

25:54.803 --> 25:56.554
You thought right.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.646
When did you know?

26:07.524 --> 26:10.818
You're the only one I told about
the escape fund,

26:10.903 --> 26:13.988
and Travis doesn't have
the ambition to pull this off.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.740
Are you sleeping with him?

26:18.619 --> 26:21.621
Actually, don't tell me.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.040
This is some bullshit.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.584
- So, what's plan C?
- She was plan C.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.753
Now it's time to go back to plan B,
pruning time.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.923
But you said we weren't gonna
actually have to hurt him.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.091
Did you see that?

26:33.926 --> 26:35.718
Jesus Christ. Now what?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.513
It's that cowboy Marshal.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.848
I'll deal with him.

26:46.522 --> 26:47.563
Can I help you?

26:49.066 --> 26:51.859
Yeah. I'm looking for Travis.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.196
Yeah. He's out.

26:56.198 --> 26:59.242
Wait, you that cowboy
that he was talking about?

26:59.326 --> 27:03.121
I see you got the hat,
the boots, the whole nine.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.125
- Who are you, exactly?
- I'm the gardener.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.129
Yeah, I'm just getting started.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.716
You must have to cut a lot of lawns
to pay for those gators.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.304
Let me ask you a question.
You like Westerns?

27:20.597 --> 27:22.015
Used to.

27:22.099 --> 27:26.019
Well, you know how in every Western,
the guys will take to the street,

27:26.103 --> 27:28.479
and they wait to draw until they're both set?

27:29.023 --> 27:30.857
You think that's really
how they used to do it?

27:32.609 --> 27:33.985
Sometimes, maybe.

27:34.570 --> 27:38.823
Neighborhood I grew up in, we used to take
to the street with our guns already out.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.076
Smart, smart. Lot can go wrong with a draw.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.162
Yeah?

27:44.246 --> 27:47.749
Well, sure.
I mean, it takes practice to draw clean.

27:48.584 --> 27:52.378
Suppose your front sight catches
as you're pulling or...

27:53.672 --> 27:58.092
Well, now, that went well.
But suppose my thumb hit the mag release.

27:58.177 --> 28:02.138
Now, as I'm raising my weapon,
I hear all my ammo hit the ground.

28:02.765 --> 28:06.434
Hopefully I got one in the chamber,
but are you gonna bet your life on that?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.855
It's too bad that Travis isn't here.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.649
You know that guy he housesits for, Pinter?

28:14.026 --> 28:17.695
- Yeah.
- US Marshals owe him $10,000.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.238
$10,000?

28:19.573 --> 28:23.451
I'm supposed to deliver it to him.
I was kind of hoping I could give it to Travis

28:23.577 --> 28:25.912
to give to Pinter
when he gets back from the Keys

28:25.996 --> 28:30.625
to save me from having
to go back out there.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.796
- You got the money on you right now?
- No. I left it at the office.

28:34.880 --> 28:40.093
I mean, 'cause I could hold on to it for you.
You know, just to take it off your hands.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.973
What happened? I thought you were
gonna go all High Noon on him.

28:46.308 --> 28:50.645
I am, yeah, but he's coming back shortly
with a big bag of money.

28:50.771 --> 28:55.149
Turns out he just wanted
to give Pinter a reward or something.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.317
How big a reward?

28:57.653 --> 28:59.237
Five grand.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.074
That's gonna split real great
between the three of us.

29:03.158 --> 29:07.995
Now, the only thing is, you know, once
we get the money, cowboy, he got to go.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.958
So, you got a place to bury him?

29:12.668 --> 29:14.502
So you're gonna draw on him
when he comes back here?

29:14.670 --> 29:17.004
I'm gonna put a hole through his hat.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.427
- Yep.
- Can I get Pinter's reward money back?

29:22.511 --> 29:25.263
- You found him.
- I think I know where he is.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.265
All right, Raylan. I'll bite.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.976
I need to do a little more checking first.

29:31.645 --> 29:35.189
Since when does checking require
that you carry around my 20 grand?

29:36.942 --> 29:39.485
You better damn sure
get him to sign a receipt.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.616
- Tim.
- Yeah?

29:45.701 --> 29:47.618
When you were working with Pinter,
you ever come across a guy

29:47.703 --> 29:52.206
looks like a black Mr. Clean,
dresses like the janitor in a rap video?

29:52.291 --> 29:54.542
Like it says Tommy Hilfiger on his coveralls?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.378
Yeah. Like he wears a t-shirt with his gators.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.006
Detroit accent, looks like
he can dead-lift the back of a car?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.677
Curtis Mims. Runs collections for Pinter.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.221
Told me he was a gardener.

30:07.681 --> 30:10.141
I don't recall Pinter's house
having much of a garden.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.517
Wasn't at Pinter's.

30:12.019 --> 30:15.980
- He's a leg-breaker. I avoided him.
- He's from Detroit?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.315
Far as I know.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.817
Seems like everyone's from somewhere else.

30:20.861 --> 30:23.154
Pinter seems hell-bent
on getting out of here.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.866
- Is that why you two hit it off so well?
- We didn't. Not really.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.661
How come you're going after this so hard?

30:31.371 --> 30:34.499
Well, you gave him to me.
Makes him my responsibility.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.083
Besides, something doesn't feel right,

30:36.210 --> 30:37.585
which means someone
ain't telling me something,

30:37.711 --> 30:39.837
which means somebody's trying
to put one over on me.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.591
I don't like that.

30:45.552 --> 30:49.430
- Choose one. We'll see how you do.
- You want me to play with you now?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.892
Yeah. I want to try all these,
see which one I get out the fastest.

30:53.602 --> 30:58.439
- All right. Should we unload them first?
- No. You need the right feel. The weight.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.985
Stick that in your belt,
right there on the side.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.030
You know, the cowboy's
gonna have a holster.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.241
Man, I don't give a shit.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.494
- What if he outdraws you?
- Then I'm dead.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.955
That's how this works.
Now, we gonna play or what?

31:14.081 --> 31:16.541
Stop asking me all them damn questions,
man. Shut the hell up.

31:16.625 --> 31:21.963
- I think you're getting too far away now.
- Nah, man. I'm good. This is fine.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.800
So, what now? We count to three or what?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.677
No counting.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.972
You feel him going for his, you go for yours.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.515
Eye contact.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.476
You ready?

31:36.353 --> 31:37.436
Ready.

31:41.483 --> 31:45.820
Bang, you're dead, baby!
See, you're too slow.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.490
Yeah. You got me.

32:08.343 --> 32:11.012
What happened to your stress techniques?

32:12.180 --> 32:15.099
Baby, circumstances have changed, okay?

32:15.183 --> 32:17.935
What we got here's a classic
ticking-bomb scenario, okay?

32:18.020 --> 32:22.189
There's a body in the yard.
The Marshal's on the scent.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.191
It's time to stop half-assing.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.320
Okay, but what if he's telling the truth?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.822
What if there is no money stash?

32:29.906 --> 32:31.699
You're the one he told about it.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.743
Well, maybe he was just
trying to impress me.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.496
Well, the only way to find out
is by asking, now, isn't it?

32:37.581 --> 32:38.914
So, I tell you what I'm gonna do.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.042
I'm gonna start taking pieces off of him,

32:42.169 --> 32:44.587
including the one
that no man wants taken off.

32:44.921 --> 32:49.342
And after he passes out,
I'm gonna cut his eyes open.

32:50.719 --> 32:55.681
After that, I'll believe just
about anything he tells me.

32:55.766 --> 32:56.932
Who are you?

32:58.769 --> 33:00.603
I am whoever I need to be.

33:18.580 --> 33:23.542
Oh, God. Arnold, I'm so sorry.

33:23.752 --> 33:28.005
Hey, it was a good play,
and I'm proud of you.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.187
Travis Travers, just the man I wanted to see.

33:43.313 --> 33:46.649
Yeah. Curtis mentioned
you might be stopping by.

33:46.775 --> 33:50.152
Yeah. Do you mind if I come in?
I got some papers I need you to sign.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.614
Yeah. Come on in.

33:58.203 --> 34:01.288
We don't have time. We don't have time.
Can you get a gun?

34:01.456 --> 34:05.000
Wow. That seems like more than five grand.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.460
That's 'cause it's 20.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.213
Where'd you get five? Curtis?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.299
You don't think he's trying to
hold out on you, do you?

34:14.136 --> 34:17.722
You know what? Why don't we go ask him?
I think he's out back.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.014
Okay.

34:19.306 --> 34:23.310
I can't wait to see the look on his face.
I am so disappointed in him.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.199
Shots fired, 9922 Tates Creek Road.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.909
Plainclothes officer on site.
Requesting backup.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.371
- Here. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.496
- Okay. Come on.
- All right.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.515
He's coming.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.686
Holy shit, Marshal!

35:29.044 --> 35:32.588
Marshal, are you okay? Marshal?

35:33.048 --> 35:34.215
Shit.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.559
Good breath sounds. No aspiration.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.979
Probable lung contusion,
but I'd say a puncture's unlikely.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.524
We'll need an x-ray to confirm.

35:51.608 --> 35:55.945
I love how these guys are so calm
when you're coughing up blood.

35:56.029 --> 36:00.199
Well, before he goes,
you want him to check your heart?

36:00.283 --> 36:04.370
Well, at least he didn't hit the money.

36:04.454 --> 36:07.081
You know, Raylan, you're gonna have
a week's paid leave coming up

36:07.165 --> 36:08.916
'cause of the investigation.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.503
- That's gonna be a very restful time.
- Seriously, I'm fine.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.172
I meant restful for me.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.466
Why isn't she wearing cuffs?

36:19.094 --> 36:20.886
He's claiming she was a hostage, too.

36:25.559 --> 36:29.603
- Fellows, just give us a minute.
- I'm good, doll.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.737
So, she's just as much a victim as you are.
Is that your story?

36:39.072 --> 36:40.614
All right, listen, Marshal.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.367
I want you to understand
how much I really appreciate...

36:43.451 --> 36:45.744
Then tell the truth.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.414
Well, if she was in on it,
and I'm not saying she was,

36:48.498 --> 36:52.918
but if she was, she was only doing
what I taught her to do.

36:53.003 --> 36:56.255
- So she gets a pass.
- You can't be serious.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.382
Well, of course I'm gonna fire her ass.

36:58.466 --> 37:01.302
Friends is friends, but they were
gonna cut pieces off of me.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.887
If she was in on it.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.264
If.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.807
And you care that much about the money,

37:06.892 --> 37:09.685
you were gonna let them cut pieces
off you rather than give it up?

37:10.020 --> 37:13.856
If buying my life back means selling
my dream, is it really worth buying?

37:16.192 --> 37:19.904
Listen, did I tell you why I call it
my escape fund?

37:19.988 --> 37:22.281
I hate it here. Kentucky.

37:22.365 --> 37:27.369
I hate every one of these toothless,
banjo-strumming, redneck pricks.

37:30.415 --> 37:35.794
No offense. So, as soon as I get
my stake back, I'm gone. I'm going to Tahiti.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.254
You ever been to Tahiti?

37:37.547 --> 37:39.632
No. Is it that nice?

37:40.425 --> 37:45.346
I've never been there,
but all I know is Tahiti ain't Kentucky.

37:46.556 --> 37:50.059
Hey, Pinter, just out of curiosity,

37:50.143 --> 37:52.811
do you remember which one of us
toothless rednecks it was

37:52.896 --> 37:54.897
that invited you down here
in the first place?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.025
One of you guys got my envelope?

38:30.392 --> 38:33.394
- I swore I'd never come back here.
- I know.

38:33.478 --> 38:37.690
And then, when they sent me here,
I promised myself I'd leave first chance I got.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.401
I know. You told me.

38:40.527 --> 38:45.906
What would happen if I found something
here that made me not want to leave?

38:48.076 --> 38:50.661
- That would be a crying shame.
- Wouldn't it?

38:50.745 --> 38:56.333
Put me in danger of breaking my promise.
Terrible to break a promise to yourself.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.502
It's a good thing you haven't found
anything back here

38:58.586 --> 39:00.087
attractive enough to make you want to stay.

39:01.214 --> 39:05.426
Yeah. See, that's what I thought.
It's a good thing.
