01:58.622 --> 02:00.021
That one.

02:04.694 --> 02:06.127
Here, boy.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.724
You're heavy.

02:14.604 --> 02:16.128
And slobbery.

02:22.690 --> 02:23.884
There.

02:24.759 --> 02:26.590
You're a good boy.

02:28.529 --> 02:30.258
You're my good boy.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.314
Hello?

02:41.423 --> 02:43.857
Penny,
I don't have much time.

02:43.959 --> 02:46.723
<i>Daddy?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:47.529 --> 02:50.521
Something's come up at work, honey.

02:50.632 --> 02:54.007
Daddy's not gonna
be home for a while.

02:54.837 --> 02:56.361
I don't understand.

02:56.472 --> 02:59.427
<i>You can't go back</i>
<i>to the house, Penny. Okay?</i>

03:00.728 --> 03:01.786
<i>What's happening?</i>

03:03.111 --> 03:07.070
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>You won't be alone. You have Bolt.</i>

03:09.017 --> 03:10.644
<i>I've altered him.</i>

03:28.303 --> 03:30.168
<i>He can protect you now.</i>

03:50.691 --> 03:56.926
<i>The doctor has been taken care of,</i>
<i>which, of course, is wonderful news.</i>

03:57.031 --> 03:59.932
<i>Everything is positioning nicely.</i>

04:00.468 --> 04:03.631
There he is. Dr. Calico.

04:06.107 --> 04:09.099
Any luck getting our guest
to spill his guts?

04:09.210 --> 04:15.012
<i>Oh! His guts will spill,</i>
<i>one way or another.</i>

04:15.116 --> 04:17.050
<i>Never! I'll never talk.</i>

04:18.586 --> 04:20.247
Daddy!

04:20.353 --> 04:25.849
<i>You're beginning to irk me, professor.</i>
<i>I am irked, and that will not do.</i>

04:26.460 --> 04:28.428
<i>Has the package arrived?</i>

04:28.529 --> 04:33.831
<i>I think it might make our dear friend</i>
<i>a bit more communicative.</i>

04:33.935 --> 04:36.233
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

04:36.337 --> 04:41.206
<i>Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me</i>
<i>on the first flight.</i>

04:56.023 --> 04:57.513
Bolt, let's go.

05:23.784 --> 05:26.150
<i>We only need the girl.</i>

06:00.254 --> 06:01.346
What?

06:01.455 --> 06:04.686
- Where's Calico?
- I'm not talking to you.

06:06.460 --> 06:09.987
Bolivia! Bolivia!
Calico's in Bolivia!

06:10.097 --> 06:11.997
Near Lake Rogaguado!

06:13.200 --> 06:15.668
Lake Rogaguado! I should've known.

06:22.376 --> 06:25.038
- Come on, Bolt. Let's go!
- No!

06:49.170 --> 06:52.435
Bolivia.
There's a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

07:05.486 --> 07:07.317
Bolt! Zoom, zoom.

08:00.074 --> 08:01.598
Bolt, fetch.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.886
Puppy!

09:42.243 --> 09:43.210
Good boy.

09:44.378 --> 09:45.606
Airport.

09:48.315 --> 09:49.475
Uh-oh!

09:54.755 --> 09:56.586
Bolt, speak.

10:35.829 --> 10:39.321
Okay, okay. Good job, buddy.

10:41.201 --> 10:42.998
Mission accomplished.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.271
That's a keeper.

10:48.676 --> 10:51.543
It's all right, tough guy.
You got them all.

10:55.901 --> 10:58.802
Don't worry, Bolt.
You saved the day again.

11:02.222 --> 11:04.190
All right. Good job.
Let's strike the set.

11:07.794 --> 11:09.955
We're gonna need a cable guard on set
for that move tomorrow.

11:10.063 --> 11:11.655
Yeah. All right.

11:15.168 --> 11:16.135
<i>Good boy.</i>

11:17.337 --> 11:18.531
<i>Airport.</i>

11:21.375 --> 11:22.535
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

11:26.647 --> 11:28.376
<i>Bolt, speak.</i>

11:31.718 --> 11:33.185
- Boom mike.
- We got a boom mike.

11:33.287 --> 11:34.879
It's a boom mike.

11:36.623 --> 11:38.420
That's sloppy.

11:38.525 --> 11:42.291
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that.

11:42.529 --> 11:45.760
Uh... Who cares
if the dog sees a boom mike?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.098
What? Who's that?

11:48.201 --> 11:52.017
Forgive me for answering a question
with a question,

11:52.123 --> 11:55.058
but who are you?

11:55.527 --> 11:58.928
- Mindy Parker, from the network.
- Of course.

11:59.864 --> 12:03.197
Let me ask you,
Mindy from the network,

12:03.301 --> 12:05.132
what do you see here?

12:05.637 --> 12:06.729
Uh...

12:07.038 --> 12:09.939
- The dog.
- "The dog," she says.

12:10.775 --> 12:15.212
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy.

12:15.613 --> 12:17.877
Am I missing something?

12:17.982 --> 12:20.746
You're missing everything, Mindy.

12:20.852 --> 12:22.786
You see a dog.

12:22.887 --> 12:29.087
I see an animal who believes with
every fiber of his being, every fiber,

12:29.194 --> 12:31.890
that the girl he loves is
in mortal danger.

12:31.996 --> 12:34.021
I see a depth of emotion
on the face of that canine

12:34.132 --> 12:38.398
the likes of which has never
been captured on screen before!

12:38.503 --> 12:40.987
Never, Mindy from the network!

12:41.187 --> 12:42.176
Hmm.

12:42.288 --> 12:47.316
We jump through hoops to make sure
that Bolt believes everything is real.

12:47.427 --> 12:50.760
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot,

12:50.864 --> 12:55.824
and it's why we most certainly
do not let the dog see boom mikes!

12:58.071 --> 13:01.370
Because, Mindy from the network,

13:02.742 --> 13:09.443
if the dog believes it,
the audience believes it.

13:11.418 --> 13:13.545
Wow. Okay.

13:13.653 --> 13:17.646
You want reality? Here you go, chief.
The show's too predictable.

13:17.757 --> 13:21.215
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy English guy, we get it.

13:21.327 --> 13:22.589
There's always a happy ending.

13:22.695 --> 13:26.096
And our focus groups tell us
18-to-35-year-olds are unhappy.

13:26.199 --> 13:27.860
They're not happy with happy.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.832
So maybe you should, I don't know,

13:29.936 --> 13:32.666
spend a little less time
worrying about the dog's Method acting

13:32.772 --> 13:33.864
and more time figuring out

13:33.973 --> 13:36.464
how to stop 20-year-olds in Topeka
from changing the channel.

13:36.576 --> 13:39.374
Because if you lose
so much as half a rating point,

13:39.479 --> 13:43.677
so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you.

13:44.651 --> 13:46.380
How's that for real?

13:49.622 --> 13:51.613
There. Perfect.

13:53.893 --> 13:55.326
You saved me again, Bolt.

13:57.597 --> 14:01.590
It's okay. It's nothing.
No more bad guys.

14:02.001 --> 14:05.198
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Are you hungry?

14:10.777 --> 14:13.575
You got them, Bolt.
No one's gonna hurt me.

14:15.548 --> 14:17.948
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

14:20.153 --> 14:22.246
Come here, buddy. Come here.

14:23.823 --> 14:25.882
Go get it, Bolt. Go get it.

14:27.694 --> 14:29.958
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

14:31.397 --> 14:33.456
Well, what do we have here?

14:33.566 --> 14:37.559
Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot.

14:57.190 --> 15:00.887
Bolt. You know I have to go.

15:16.276 --> 15:18.244
Yeah, you're my good boy.

15:26.553 --> 15:29.420
There she is. My little superstar.

15:29.522 --> 15:31.683
Let's get to that <i>Teen Vogue</i>
cover shoot.

15:31.791 --> 15:34.851
Mom, I wanna take Bolt home
this weekend.

15:34.961 --> 15:36.292
Well, I...

15:36.796 --> 15:38.320
- That would be...
- That'd be nice. That'd be great.

15:38.431 --> 15:43.266
That would. A little girl and her dog.
Nothing better than that.

15:45.638 --> 15:48.766
So I can bring Bolt home?

15:49.075 --> 15:52.602
As your friend I say, "Yes, absolutely,"

15:53.079 --> 15:57.448
but as your agent, I have to remind you
this is Bolt's world.

15:57.550 --> 16:01.111
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.347
But he never gets to be a real dog,

16:03.456 --> 16:05.447
and it would only be for the weekend,
and I just want...

16:05.558 --> 16:08.118
Well, you know what?
It's a fair question.

16:08.227 --> 16:11.424
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.
Boop! Pin in.

16:11.531 --> 16:13.692
There you go.
Now, let's let that hang there a bit,

16:13.800 --> 16:15.791
and then we'll address that
when we've thought things through.

16:15.902 --> 16:17.426
Okay? Good enough for everybody?

16:17.537 --> 16:19.596
Smiles all around?
Let's get out of here. Come on.

16:19.706 --> 16:23.233
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

16:23.343 --> 16:25.937
Look at this face.

16:26.045 --> 16:28.445
I have a little girl at home,
love of my life.

16:28.548 --> 16:30.846
I would do anything for her,

16:30.950 --> 16:33.919
and I would trade her for you
in a heartbeat.

16:34.754 --> 16:36.016
True story.

16:36.122 --> 16:38.750
That reminds me,
we need to be getting over to wardrobe.

16:38.858 --> 16:39.984
- Clip-clip, let's go.
- But...

16:40.093 --> 16:42.118
I need her in hair.
- I just...

16:42.228 --> 16:43.855
Can I get her for five minutes
in makeup?

16:43.963 --> 16:46.727
I wanna go for something more natural.

16:51.638 --> 16:55.074
So the dog thinks
this is all real?

16:55.208 --> 16:56.937
Oh, yeah, you're new.

16:57.043 --> 16:59.637
Guy never leaves the set.
It's unbelievable.

16:59.746 --> 17:03.546
Whenever I get the chance,
this is the perfect way to unwind.

17:05.518 --> 17:07.986
I like to start with an evil laugh.

17:11.691 --> 17:13.852
Hello, hairballs.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.895
You may have won today, Bolt,

17:16.996 --> 17:21.228
but in the end,
we will get your little Penny.

17:21.334 --> 17:24.929
Not likely, cat, for you've chosen
to follow the path of evil.

17:25.038 --> 17:29.475
Ultimately, it will destroy you,
along with your fiendish puppet master!

17:29.942 --> 17:32.877
- Wow!
- I know, right? Okay, watch this.

17:34.213 --> 17:36.613
She's a goner, dog.

17:36.716 --> 17:40.880
The Green-Eyed Man has a plan,
and soon, he will execute it.

17:42.221 --> 17:48.888
- Yeah, and then he will execute her.
- Nice.

17:48.995 --> 17:52.431
I would superbark you both
back into the hole you crawled out of,

17:52.532 --> 17:55.000
but I need you alive
because I've got a little message

17:55.101 --> 17:57.433
for you to take back
to your Green-Eyed Man.

17:57.537 --> 17:59.903
You tell him
his old friend Bolt said he better...

18:00.006 --> 18:01.337
Is it long?

18:02.275 --> 18:04.175
- Is what long?
- The message.

18:04.277 --> 18:07.838
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.

18:07.947 --> 18:10.177
Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him I said I'm gonna...

18:10.283 --> 18:12.342
You know what? Why don't we do this?

18:12.452 --> 18:14.682
You remember
the first half of the message,

18:14.787 --> 18:16.482
and then I'll remember the second,

18:16.589 --> 18:18.648
and then we can pass it on
to the Green-Eyed Man together.

18:18.758 --> 18:21.556
Now, I don't care how
the message is translated, all right?

18:21.661 --> 18:23.094
Just do it, okay.

18:23.196 --> 18:25.494
Tell the Green-Eyed Man
that I will not sleep,

18:25.598 --> 18:29.398
I will not rest until my Penny
is safe from his evil clutches.

18:29.502 --> 18:30.696
You tell the Green-Eyed Man
that reckoning...

18:30.803 --> 18:32.100
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:32.205 --> 18:33.729
Way too many words.

18:33.840 --> 18:37.139
I was, like, "What?"
And then I was, like, "Huh?"

18:37.243 --> 18:41.475
And then, well, I got a little bored and...
Something about clutches?

18:41.581 --> 18:43.674
Anyway, I'll do my best. <i>Ciao.</i>

18:43.783 --> 18:47.184
By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you.
Gotta go. Thank you.

18:47.286 --> 18:52.325
Get back here,
you sick, revolting, loathsome little...

18:57.363 --> 18:58.421
Dogs.

18:59.799 --> 19:00.891
Cats.

19:08.641 --> 19:11.109
I'll never let them get you, Penny.

19:29.862 --> 19:30.829
Are you ready, Bolt?

19:34.534 --> 19:39.864
Let's widen out camera three.
Ready four. Go four!

19:39.972 --> 19:42.375
And driver.

19:50.783 --> 19:52.273
Thanks, Larry.

19:52.952 --> 19:53.919
<i>All right, Scooter.</i>

19:54.020 --> 19:56.648
<i>Find the grate.</i>
<i>Ready on the rubber bars.</i>

20:00.860 --> 20:02.987
<i>And track with them.</i>

20:05.998 --> 20:07.966
The Calico supercomputer.

20:08.634 --> 20:13.071
If we can access it, we'll finally learn
where they're keeping my father.

20:31.924 --> 20:33.551
The weapon's hot.

20:35.094 --> 20:36.721
Heat vision time.

20:38.097 --> 20:39.689
Bolt, stare.

20:39.799 --> 20:40.925
Now!

20:54.347 --> 20:55.644
Nice move.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.244
Come on. Come on.

21:01.287 --> 21:06.748
Such devotion.
It brings tears to my eyes.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.190
Calico.

21:08.294 --> 21:14.494
Your father's discoveries could be
of great use to our organization.

21:15.701 --> 21:21.731
I'm sure he'll be more accommodating
now that I've got his lucky Penny!

21:23.242 --> 21:24.300
Bolt!

21:26.178 --> 21:29.579
World domination is within my grasp!

21:41.627 --> 21:44.687
How did your focus groups
feel about cliffhangers?

21:44.797 --> 21:47.732
You ask for
unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds,

21:47.833 --> 21:52.861
I give you unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds.

21:53.005 --> 21:55.803
<i>Bolt! It's okay, Bolt.
I'm fine.</i>

21:55.908 --> 21:56.932
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

21:57.043 --> 21:58.340
<i>Guards, stop her!</i>

21:58.444 --> 22:00.810
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Bolt!

22:00.913 --> 22:03.575
Listen to him.
He needs to know I'm okay.

22:03.683 --> 22:05.708
Nope, you're not okay.

22:05.818 --> 22:08.810
You've been kidnapped
by the fiendish Dr. Calico,

22:08.921 --> 22:10.855
at least
that's what the dog needs to think,

22:10.957 --> 22:13.448
but just imagine,
close your eyes and imagine

22:13.559 --> 22:17.552
how excited he'll be
when he saves you tomorrow. Okay?

22:17.663 --> 22:19.790
But he's gonna be
freaking out all night.

22:19.899 --> 22:21.730
- Please, just let me...
- What...

22:21.834 --> 22:24.029
Wait a second,
what's that behind your ear?

22:24.136 --> 22:25.501
Is that a...

22:25.838 --> 22:28.932
Yes, it is.
It's a pin. Let's do this.

22:29.075 --> 22:32.704
Let's take the pin
and put it in this conversation. Boop!

22:32.812 --> 22:34.507
And we will not take it down,
no, ma'am,

22:34.613 --> 22:36.274
until this matter is resolved.

22:36.382 --> 22:38.509
- But I just...
- Do you know what that reminds me of?

22:38.617 --> 22:41.950
The DVD release junket.
Let's get going. It's a big push.

22:42.054 --> 22:44.784
I want to go with a modern look,
something that says,

22:44.890 --> 22:46.949
"I'm 13, and I'm fine with that."

22:47.059 --> 22:51.291
All right, okay. Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

23:00.339 --> 23:02.398
I've been working on my evil laugh.

23:02.508 --> 23:03.497
'Cause everybody has an evil laugh.

23:05.444 --> 23:06.433
Like that.

23:06.545 --> 23:08.775
Okay, here's the thing.
You're not ready for the evil laugh.

23:08.881 --> 23:11.509
You could do a chuckle,
like a mildly upset chuckle,

23:11.617 --> 23:13.175
after my evil laugh.

23:13.285 --> 23:14.252
Listen to mine.

23:15.421 --> 23:16.388
Hey, Bolt.

23:17.356 --> 23:18.550
Big fan!

23:19.825 --> 23:21.383
Bolt! Come back!

23:25.297 --> 23:26.559
I'm too late.

23:26.665 --> 23:29.566
<i>Bolt! Help!</i>
- I'm coming, Penny!

23:30.803 --> 23:32.134
<i>Bolt! Help!</i>

23:34.840 --> 23:36.774
Hold on, Penny! Hold on!

23:37.777 --> 23:41.941
<i>Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help!</i>

23:53.025 --> 23:54.219
Penny!

24:07.573 --> 24:09.803
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

24:34.934 --> 24:35.992
Huh?

24:40.973 --> 24:41.962
Whoa!

24:42.074 --> 24:44.406
Okay! Hey! Hey!

24:51.817 --> 24:55.685
Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

24:59.625 --> 25:00.853
Oh!

25:03.629 --> 25:05.324
The Green-Eyed Man.

25:20.546 --> 25:21.604
Hmm.

25:23.582 --> 25:24.640
Huh?

25:33.159 --> 25:34.956
Penny! Penny!

25:47.806 --> 25:49.068
Ow!

25:57.283 --> 25:58.409
Penny!

26:00.619 --> 26:02.018
Target acquired.

26:15.768 --> 26:17.201
It ends here.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.142
Penny!

26:29.682 --> 26:32.116
Penny? They moved her.

26:37.623 --> 26:39.284
There's no time
for formalities, brothers.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.756
My person's in danger, and I...

26:41.961 --> 26:44.486
- Whoa! What are you doing?
- Oh! I'm sorry.

26:44.897 --> 26:45.989
You wanna sniff mine first?

26:46.098 --> 26:47.065
What?

26:47.166 --> 26:48.155
Not from around here,
are you?

26:48.267 --> 26:50.735
Hey, stop it! This is serious!

26:52.538 --> 26:54.938
Hey there. Are you lost, sweetie?

26:55.374 --> 26:56.671
Hey! Wait!

27:17.997 --> 27:22.161
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

27:23.802 --> 27:25.360
Oh, buddy.

27:27.773 --> 27:30.833
You got your head stuck pretty good,
huh, guy?

27:30.943 --> 27:32.808
Hey, guys, come here.

27:32.911 --> 27:35.709
Check this out.
He's got his melon stuck.

27:36.582 --> 27:39.574
Yup, that is one stuck melon.

27:42.187 --> 27:45.054
Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy.
Slow down.

27:45.157 --> 27:48.684
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I'm missing my person.

27:50.262 --> 27:56.326
Hey, buddy, relax. Like this.
Turn and pull. Turn and pull.

27:56.769 --> 27:59.465
Forget about it. You'll be out, no time.

28:12.284 --> 28:15.151
What are these things?
They've weakened me.

28:19.325 --> 28:23.386
- Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

28:23.495 --> 28:26.123
This has the Green-Eyed Man
written all over it.

28:26.231 --> 28:28.165
Have you seen the man
with the green eye?

28:28.267 --> 28:31.202
You know,
I gotta say something,

28:31.303 --> 28:32.998
if I could say something here.

28:33.105 --> 28:36.506
You look familiar.
Joey, look at this guy's mug.

28:36.608 --> 28:40.271
Yeah. You know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

28:40.379 --> 28:41.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:41.480 --> 28:45.041
- I gotta tell you, I never forget a face.
- He never does.

28:45.150 --> 28:46.117
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Never.

28:46.218 --> 28:48.686
Yeah, he's real good
with the faces and such.

28:48.787 --> 28:49.776
Listen, listen!

28:49.888 --> 28:53.449
The man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

28:55.094 --> 28:57.858
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

28:57.963 --> 29:01.133
I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me.
Hold on.

29:07.139 --> 29:09.300
No, I don't know. I thought I knew.

29:09.408 --> 29:13.105
Hey, you ever hang out down on
14th Street with a stray named Kelvin?

29:13.212 --> 29:14.236
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:14.346 --> 29:16.709
- Kelvin, the Labradoodle.
- What?

29:16.815 --> 29:20.251
You gotta give me something here,
'cause this is ridonculous.

29:20.352 --> 29:21.944
Absolutely ridonculous.

29:22.054 --> 29:23.885
<i>Capisce,</i> ridonculous.
You know what that means?

29:25.157 --> 29:26.852
You pigeons are useless.

29:26.959 --> 29:31.055
I need someone on the inside,
someone close to the Green-Eyed Man.

29:31.797 --> 29:32.923
A cat.

29:33.565 --> 29:35.396
Ooh. A cat?

29:35.501 --> 29:37.196
Yeah, a cat.

29:37.302 --> 29:39.736
And when I find him,
when I find him,

29:39.838 --> 29:42.898
I'm gonna make that cat
wish he were never born.

29:46.311 --> 29:48.472
I think we know just the cat.

29:53.886 --> 29:56.184
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

29:58.323 --> 29:59.984
Okay, Saul, nice work.

30:00.092 --> 30:02.060
Let's find some mustard next time.
Okay, babe?

30:02.161 --> 30:04.823
Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

30:06.765 --> 30:10.724
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?
Attaboy.

30:10.836 --> 30:12.463
Good day, Mittens.

30:14.173 --> 30:15.140
Louie?

30:16.642 --> 30:17.631
What is this?

30:18.444 --> 30:22.278
It was a slow week.
That's half of what I got.

30:24.550 --> 30:27.314
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

30:27.653 --> 30:29.951
And when the old stomach
starts talking,

30:30.055 --> 30:34.651
it ain't talking to me.
It's talking to the claws.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.625
Not the claws! Please.

30:36.728 --> 30:39.060
I'm holding these bad boys back,
best I can,

30:39.164 --> 30:42.224
but, thing is, it's not up to me.

30:42.334 --> 30:44.802
The stomach's got a direct line
to these babies

30:44.903 --> 30:48.270
and I'm picking up a lot of chatter.

30:48.974 --> 30:50.874
So, I'll talk to the claws,

30:50.976 --> 30:55.106
but in exchange,
next week all your food comes to me.

30:55.214 --> 30:57.512
But that's not our deal.

30:57.616 --> 31:01.245
I bring you half, you give me protection.
That's our deal.

31:01.353 --> 31:04.948
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now get lost.

31:05.424 --> 31:07.585
Mark my words, Mittens.

31:07.693 --> 31:11.094
One day
someone's gonna stand up to you.

31:11.196 --> 31:13.756
Someone's gonna teach you a lesson.

31:13.866 --> 31:15.390
Yeah. I'm really scared now.

31:16.702 --> 31:18.101
You should be!

31:18.203 --> 31:19.602
Okay! Yeah!

31:19.705 --> 31:20.763
Where is she?

31:20.873 --> 31:21.931
Uh...

31:23.208 --> 31:25.267
- Who?
- You know why I'm here.

31:25.377 --> 31:27.436
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay.

31:27.546 --> 31:29.810
Look, buddy, I don't know
what you're getting at, but...

31:31.683 --> 31:35.084
Come on, Mittens.
Just tell the guy where she is.

31:35.187 --> 31:36.745
Tell the dog, make him happy.

31:36.855 --> 31:39.449
Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens.
Tell him!

31:41.260 --> 31:44.821
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

31:45.264 --> 31:48.961
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

31:50.302 --> 31:51.963
- You got her, pal.
- That's her.

31:52.070 --> 31:55.369
- She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat.

31:57.175 --> 31:59.666
Looks like we're gonna do this
the hard way.

32:00.546 --> 32:01.843
Whoa!

32:01.947 --> 32:03.881
Hey, you're crazy, man!

32:05.651 --> 32:08.381
Hey, Joey. Did we go too far in this?

32:08.487 --> 32:12.389
You kidding?
This is the best day of my life.

32:12.691 --> 32:14.022
You work for the men in black,

32:14.126 --> 32:15.753
who work for the man
with the green eye.

32:15.861 --> 32:19.388
- They've taken Penny. Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

32:19.498 --> 32:24.026
This is becoming tiresome, cat.
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

32:24.136 --> 32:27.071
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk!

32:27.172 --> 32:30.733
I know where Penny is. Yeah.
They have her. Yes!

32:30.842 --> 32:34.778
The men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes!

32:34.880 --> 32:36.177
Blue eyes?

32:36.281 --> 32:37.441
Um... Oh!

32:37.549 --> 32:40.109
Green! Yes, green! The one green eye!

32:40.218 --> 32:45.121
You just can't stop lying, can you, cat?
It's in the genes. It's just gross.

32:46.325 --> 32:49.488
I know. It's disgusting.
I disgust myself.

32:50.929 --> 32:52.260
Hollywood.

32:53.265 --> 32:56.962
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

32:58.136 --> 32:59.103
Hmm.

33:08.213 --> 33:11.546
You know, I hope you
appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

33:12.751 --> 33:15.242
Every bone
in my evil cat body is telling me

33:15.354 --> 33:18.323
not to betray the trust
of the Green-Eyed Man.

33:18.857 --> 33:25.729
Okay. This is a top, top secret map
of the entire Earth.

33:28.066 --> 33:31.502
Now we're over here,
by the green lady with the big torch,

33:31.603 --> 33:34.003
and my boss has Penny locked up...

33:34.106 --> 33:35.164
Uh...

33:35.774 --> 33:40.905
Right... Right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sunglasses.

33:41.013 --> 33:44.073
Now all you need to do
is get from here to there.

33:44.182 --> 33:45.171
Hmm.

33:45.283 --> 33:50.812
Well, I told you where to find her so
if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

33:50.922 --> 33:53.584
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

33:53.692 --> 33:57.685
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal.
We had a deal!

33:57.796 --> 33:59.661
Your deal just expired.

34:00.432 --> 34:03.196
She said that to me
not 10 minutes ago.

34:03.301 --> 34:05.064
The irony.

34:10.308 --> 34:11.297
Ooh!

34:11.409 --> 34:12.603
Perfect.

34:17.516 --> 34:18.505
Hmm.

34:18.617 --> 34:19.914
Padlocked.

34:24.022 --> 34:27.047
Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty wicked
claws under these mitts.

34:27.159 --> 34:31.289
Do not, I beg of you, do not make me
bring out these bad boys.

34:31.663 --> 34:33.130
It gets ugly.

34:35.734 --> 34:37.565
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

34:37.668 --> 34:41.867
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

34:42.474 --> 34:44.442
Now I'm concerned
on a number of levels.

34:44.543 --> 34:45.532
Easy, watch.
- I'm good.

34:45.643 --> 34:46.702
Watch it, though. Ow!
- You got it?

34:46.812 --> 34:49.042
- Intruders!
- Slow down!

34:49.147 --> 34:51.842
You're scraping the fur off my...

34:54.786 --> 34:56.650
Oh, boy. This thing is heavy.

34:56.755 --> 35:00.054
Hey, hey. Put it down.
I forgot the keys.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.757
I'll be right back.

35:09.801 --> 35:10.825
Oh!

35:12.137 --> 35:14.071
Hey, lucky penny!

35:15.340 --> 35:17.035
Thanks! Now move your butt.

35:17.142 --> 35:19.201
Okay. Up on your end.
- All right, just a little bit.

35:19.311 --> 35:20.278
Like that? A little bit more.

35:20.378 --> 35:21.640
Yeah. I got... No, I got mine.

35:21.747 --> 35:23.078
You got it?

35:31.056 --> 35:35.584
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I know that dog. I'm telling you, Joey.

35:35.694 --> 35:38.424
Bobby, you guys are looking at me like,
"He don't know."

35:38.530 --> 35:41.693
Telling you, I know this dog.
I seen him somewheres.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.564
Hey, you'll remember it tonight
when you're preening.

35:44.669 --> 35:46.864
Right, that's what'll happen.

36:11.396 --> 36:14.058
I have got some good news.

36:14.166 --> 36:15.793
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

36:15.901 --> 36:20.065
I just booked you
on <i>The Tonight Show,</i> lead guest.

36:20.172 --> 36:21.139
That's right.

36:22.340 --> 36:27.334
Which means just absolutely nothing
if Bolt is still missing.

36:27.445 --> 36:29.845
It's not even good news,
like, "Whatever," "So what?"

36:29.948 --> 36:32.712
<i>The Tonight Show,</i> who cares?
I don't care.

36:32.818 --> 36:33.876
Aw.

36:33.985 --> 36:35.577
It's okay, baby.

36:36.521 --> 36:39.456
- He must be so scared.
- Scared?

36:39.558 --> 36:43.722
Well, this is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.

36:45.096 --> 36:48.224
I bet Bolt would want you
to do <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

36:51.903 --> 36:53.461
Or maybe not.

36:56.408 --> 36:59.741
Bolt loves you very much, sweetie,
and you're here.

37:01.246 --> 37:03.305
He couldn't have gone far.

37:10.055 --> 37:13.388
So, if you got superpowers,

37:13.491 --> 37:17.188
I guess that would make you,
what, like, some kind of superdog?

37:17.295 --> 37:18.660
That information's classified.

37:18.763 --> 37:21.493
Come on.
Like, what's your best power?

37:21.600 --> 37:24.330
Your go-to move. How about flying?
Can you fly?

37:25.503 --> 37:29.269
- Don't be silly. I can't fly.
- Okay, okay, fine.

37:29.374 --> 37:31.774
If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers.

37:31.877 --> 37:33.504
What's it to me?

37:34.946 --> 37:36.277
I have a superbark.

37:36.381 --> 37:39.043
A superbark? Wow! You're kidding me.

37:42.187 --> 37:45.486
What exactly
does one do with a superbark?

37:45.590 --> 37:48.991
I really can't talk about it.
It's classified.

37:49.561 --> 37:51.859
So I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

37:51.963 --> 37:56.093
You're awfully attached
to this Penny character, huh, Wags?

37:56.201 --> 37:59.659
- She's my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

37:59.771 --> 38:04.105
And if you ask me,
the only good person is a...

38:08.713 --> 38:11.443
Styrofoam! Tuck and roll!

38:13.385 --> 38:14.875
Tuck and what?

38:28.867 --> 38:29.891
Ow!

38:31.036 --> 38:32.025
What?

38:32.137 --> 38:35.732
What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.774
It's called blood, hero.

38:39.311 --> 38:41.245
- Do I need it?
- Yes!

38:41.346 --> 38:44.611
So if you wanna keep it
inside your body, where it belongs,

38:44.716 --> 38:48.413
you should stop jumping off trucks
doing 80 on the interstate!

38:48.520 --> 38:51.387
Yeah, well, normally,
I'm a tad more indestructible.

38:51.489 --> 38:52.513
Must've been the...

38:52.624 --> 38:56.390
Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me.

38:56.895 --> 38:57.884
Ah-ha!

38:57.996 --> 38:59.156
What are you doing? Put that down!

38:59.264 --> 39:02.097
All right, that's it. I've had it with you.
Untie me, pooch.

39:02.200 --> 39:06.068
Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna seriously wound you!

39:06.171 --> 39:08.765
I'm gonna seriously wound you
with this Styrofoam.

39:08.873 --> 39:11.842
Are you mad?
You don't know the power of Styrofoam.

39:11.943 --> 39:13.604
Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby,

39:13.712 --> 39:17.239
and I'm about to unleash it.
The power of the Styrofoam.

39:17.349 --> 39:18.338
Whoa!

39:18.450 --> 39:21.851
All right, cat! Okay. You win.
I'll untie you.

39:25.290 --> 39:27.850
That's a weird place to put a piano.

39:30.161 --> 39:32.755
Are we gonna have
any more problems, cat?

39:32.864 --> 39:36.391
No! No, no. No more problems.
I'll take you to Penny.

39:40.939 --> 39:42.907
- What is that?
- What?

39:43.008 --> 39:44.703
That! Okay.

39:44.809 --> 39:47.607
You have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

39:47.712 --> 39:50.010
Poison? A parasite? Poison?

39:50.115 --> 39:52.242
Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I?
See, I'm all discombobulated.

39:52.350 --> 39:53.339
I can't think straight.

39:53.451 --> 39:56.045
I don't believe this. You're hungry.

39:57.255 --> 40:00.452
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! All right.

40:04.496 --> 40:06.521
There's your antidote.

40:07.565 --> 40:08.554
Food.

40:08.666 --> 40:10.361
All right, who wants burgers?

40:10.468 --> 40:12.197
I'll take one.
- Me, too!

40:12.303 --> 40:13.793
What's this?

40:13.905 --> 40:17.170
Go on, use the dog face.
This is gonna be beautiful.

40:18.343 --> 40:19.810
You know, beg.

40:21.346 --> 40:23.314
Do the dog face.

40:23.415 --> 40:26.407
What... The dog face?
What does that mean?

40:27.619 --> 40:29.883
Figures I'm tied to the one dog on Earth
who doesn't know how to beg.

40:31.089 --> 40:34.957
Okay, if you want the... The antidote,

40:35.060 --> 40:37.858
you're gonna have to do
exactly what I say.

40:39.064 --> 40:40.588
No. Not likely.

40:40.698 --> 40:43.292
You're a degenerate creature
of darkness.

40:43.401 --> 40:45.631
Yeah, yeah. Granted. But, that said,

40:45.737 --> 40:48.069
all I'm asking you to do
is just tilt your head a little.

40:48.173 --> 40:50.664
You can do that, can't you? Come on.

40:51.810 --> 40:54.040
More. More.

40:54.145 --> 40:55.635
- This is stupid.
- No, no, no, come on.

40:55.747 --> 40:57.806
Work with me on this, please.
You're almost there.

40:57.916 --> 40:59.178
Oh, boy.

41:01.019 --> 41:02.816
Okay. Try it the other way.

41:02.921 --> 41:05.321
There you go. Tilt up. Down.

41:05.457 --> 41:11.157
Now a little smile. Lose the smile.
Drop your left ear. Your other left.

41:11.262 --> 41:13.560
Okay, the other way was better.
Now drop them both.

41:13.665 --> 41:18.534
Hold it. Right there.
And ever so slightly, look up.

41:19.504 --> 41:21.529
Soup is on, baby!

41:32.117 --> 41:33.084
Aw!

41:33.184 --> 41:34.173
Oh!

41:34.285 --> 41:35.684
Here you go!

41:36.788 --> 41:37.812
Yes!

41:41.759 --> 41:42.748
Aw!

41:42.861 --> 41:44.795
Look at the little guy.

41:46.064 --> 41:47.361
Aw!

41:49.467 --> 41:51.196
Beat it, stupid cat!

41:58.910 --> 42:00.275
<i>Why do you care?</i>

42:00.378 --> 42:02.744
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>what really happened...</i>

42:02.847 --> 42:04.178
<i>And why does that</i>
<i>matter to you?</i>

42:04.282 --> 42:05.681
<i>Because I'm involved!</i>

42:05.783 --> 42:07.478
<i>With Ridge?</i>
<i>- With James!</i>

42:07.585 --> 42:09.553
<i>If you and James were</i>
<i>romantic, I wanna know about it.</i>

42:10.155 --> 42:11.179
<i>What, so you can...</i>

42:11.289 --> 42:12.847
<i>Come on down!</i>

42:13.191 --> 42:14.658
<i>Gilligan,</i>
<i>why don't you stop that.</i>

42:14.759 --> 42:17.523
<i>Come on, no Whammies!</i>
<i>No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!</i>

42:17.629 --> 42:19.790
<i>For weather</i>
<i>on the ones, here's Lester.</i>

42:19.898 --> 42:21.092
<i>It really does help,</i>

42:21.199 --> 42:23.690
<i>and it really releases</i>
<i>the serotonin, and...</i>

42:23.801 --> 42:26.702
<i>Hey, man,</i>
<i>this time we'll do it my way.</i>

42:26.804 --> 42:27.828
Ooh!

42:33.645 --> 42:35.476
Well, hello, puppy.

42:35.580 --> 42:38.811
Did you come for some of Grandma's
butter bean dumplings?

42:38.917 --> 42:40.043
Mmm-mmm.

42:40.151 --> 42:41.311
You wait right there.

42:41.419 --> 42:43.979
<i>One of these days,</i>
<i>I'm gonna pound y'all to the ground.</i>

42:44.088 --> 42:46.079
<i>No more Mr. Nice Guy.</i>

42:48.993 --> 42:53.020
Look at you.
You are quite the little actor, huh?

42:53.131 --> 42:55.497
I haven't eaten
like this in ages.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.660
Hey, look, my stomach's distended!
How great is that?

42:58.770 --> 43:01.739
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

43:01.839 --> 43:04.706
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

43:04.809 --> 43:09.371
Every week new RVs bring us
new suckers who bring us new food.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.778
Look around! It's perfect.

43:17.188 --> 43:19.213
Do my eyes deceive me?

43:19.324 --> 43:22.259
Is this some apparition
I see before me?

43:23.094 --> 43:26.552
Or could it be my hero?

43:26.664 --> 43:28.564
Oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

43:31.336 --> 43:35.534
You're Bolt, the Superdog!
You're fully awesome!

43:36.774 --> 43:42.440
- Wait a minute. You know this dog?
- I do. He is fully awesome.

43:42.547 --> 43:45.141
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've established that. Who are you?

43:45.250 --> 43:48.481
- I'm Rhino.
- Rhino the hamster.

43:48.586 --> 43:51.111
Well, you know,
my ancestry isn't all hamster.

43:51.222 --> 43:55.056
I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know,
a little wolverine in there somewhere,

43:55.159 --> 43:56.888
but that's besides the point.

43:56.995 --> 44:01.830
We have before us a legend,
Bolt, the Superdog.

44:02.333 --> 44:04.164
He can outrun speeding missiles

44:04.269 --> 44:07.568
and burn through solid metal
with his heat vision.

44:07.705 --> 44:13.007
Oh! And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his superbark!

44:13.111 --> 44:16.046
Wait a minute.
You've seen the superbark?

44:16.147 --> 44:18.172
Have you been observing me?

44:18.283 --> 44:22.583
- Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time.
- That's incredible.

44:22.687 --> 44:24.154
Oh, it's nothing, really.

44:24.255 --> 44:26.086
But I'm always so vigilant.

44:26.190 --> 44:30.058
No one can evade my detection.
You're a phantom.

44:30.261 --> 44:31.626
Uh...

44:31.729 --> 44:34.391
If you say so. Hey, check it out.

44:35.900 --> 44:41.896
Take a gander at this Bolt action.
Scary, huh? It's like we're twins.

44:42.006 --> 44:44.907
Yeah. Scary.

44:45.610 --> 44:47.601
So, where's Penny?

44:47.712 --> 44:49.873
She was kidnapped
by the Green-Eyed Man.

44:49.981 --> 44:54.384
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

44:54.485 --> 44:57.716
Grave danger. I know.
But I've captured this cat.

44:57.822 --> 45:01.383
An agent of the Green-Eyed Man,
I presume?

45:01.926 --> 45:04.554
You presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

45:04.662 --> 45:10.225
You, you are vile vermin.
How do you sleep at night?

45:10.802 --> 45:15.068
Penny's the most wonderful person
ever, and she loves Bolt.

45:15.173 --> 45:18.904
And he's awesome,
and you're a monster!

45:19.010 --> 45:23.208
How dare you disrupt their relationship
with your evil!

45:23.314 --> 45:25.612
- Die! Die!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

45:25.717 --> 45:28.208
I can take her, Bolty.
Let me at them. Die!

45:28.319 --> 45:31.720
- Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

45:32.156 --> 45:34.920
You're right. We need her alive.

45:35.293 --> 45:36.282
Uh...

45:36.394 --> 45:38.021
- "We"?
- Yes!

45:38.129 --> 45:41.621
Bolt, I can be a valuable addition
to your team.

45:41.733 --> 45:43.724
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning-quick.

45:43.835 --> 45:48.431
I have razor-sharp reflexes,
and I'm a master of stealth.

45:49.640 --> 45:52.268
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

45:53.611 --> 45:54.976
The road'll be rough.

45:55.079 --> 45:56.171
I have a ball.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.611
There's no turning back.

45:57.715 --> 45:59.706
Guess I'll have to roll with the punches.

45:59.817 --> 46:01.614
Easy won't be part of the equation.

46:01.719 --> 46:02.743
Promise?

46:02.854 --> 46:05.379
I gotta warn you.
Going into the belly of the beast,

46:05.490 --> 46:06.787
danger at every turn.

46:06.891 --> 46:09.121
I eat danger for breakfast.

46:09.227 --> 46:10.489
You hungry?

46:11.696 --> 46:12.958
Starving!

46:13.064 --> 46:14.031
Welcome aboard!

46:15.867 --> 46:18.233
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

46:19.637 --> 46:21.161
I don't know what's going on here,

46:21.272 --> 46:25.902
but I'm just a little bit concerned about
the number of lunatics on this trip.

46:26.010 --> 46:27.671
My limit is one.

46:27.779 --> 46:28.837
He's coming with us.

46:28.946 --> 46:30.140
But I... Huh?

46:30.248 --> 46:31.476
Hey!

46:31.582 --> 46:33.777
Move it, prisoner.
We're losing daylight.

46:33.885 --> 46:37.787
I agree. Now,
we need to find a fast set of wheels.

46:37.955 --> 46:41.618
I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

46:54.038 --> 46:57.496
Okay. So what we do here is
we give the target a quick flyover,

46:57.608 --> 47:00.372
we adjust the trajectory
and then land dead center.

47:00.478 --> 47:02.139
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

47:02.246 --> 47:04.578
Just the knowledge that every minute
spent in your company

47:04.682 --> 47:07.014
becomes the new greatest minute
of my life.

47:07.118 --> 47:09.814
No! Forget it!
How do you say

47:09.921 --> 47:12.185
"No way I'm doing this" in crazy?

47:12.290 --> 47:13.951
Calm down, cat. You're with me.

47:14.058 --> 47:15.286
That's the problem!

47:17.228 --> 47:18.559
Would you relax?

47:18.663 --> 47:22.497
Every time he did this on the magic box
it was awesome.

47:25.870 --> 47:26.859
Magic what?

47:26.971 --> 47:29.701
You know,
the magic box people stare at.

47:29.807 --> 47:32.742
Wait a minute. Does this magic box
have moving pictures on it?

47:32.844 --> 47:35.335
Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best.

47:35.446 --> 47:39.507
Bolt's pictures. Of course!
He's from a... Oh, no!

47:39.617 --> 47:41.778
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Bolt, dog, hear me out.

47:41.886 --> 47:44.650
Let it begin. Let it begin. Let it begin!

47:44.755 --> 47:46.416
Wait! You are not a superhero...

47:51.929 --> 47:53.260
Whoa!

47:55.533 --> 47:57.296
What are you doing?

48:13.317 --> 48:14.716
Mittens!

48:14.819 --> 48:17.151
Mittens, take my paw! I need you alive!

48:17.255 --> 48:19.951
You're crazy! Stay away from me!

48:20.057 --> 48:22.184
Take my paw. I'll save you.

48:22.293 --> 48:24.921
No, you won't! You're not really a...

48:41.746 --> 48:43.236
Bolt!

48:45.917 --> 48:47.179
Saboteur.

48:48.586 --> 48:49.883
Ow!

48:49.987 --> 48:52.285
Ouch! You moron, stop it.
I'm trying to help him.

48:52.390 --> 48:54.756
Help him? Yeah, right.

48:56.193 --> 48:58.821
Don't worry, Bolt. I'll stop her!

49:09.040 --> 49:10.701
I can't hold it.

49:15.146 --> 49:16.773
Let go, you monster!

49:16.881 --> 49:18.041
Bolt!

49:38.369 --> 49:39.393
Ow!

49:43.140 --> 49:45.404
Ow! Ow! Ow!

49:48.279 --> 49:50.747
The real world hurts,
doesn't it?

49:50.848 --> 49:53.442
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

49:53.551 --> 49:56.213
Get down here, cat.
We don't have time for this.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.947
I'll get a ladder.

49:58.990 --> 50:03.825
Look, genius, you're part of a TV show.
You know what that is? Television?

50:03.928 --> 50:09.867
It's entertainment for people. It's fake.
Nothing you think is real is real!

50:09.967 --> 50:11.298
That's preposterous.

50:11.402 --> 50:12.426
Think about it, Bolt.

50:12.536 --> 50:15.130
Since you got lost, none of your powers
are working, are they?

50:15.239 --> 50:18.140
For the first time, you're hungry,
you're bleeding.

50:18.242 --> 50:21.211
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark

50:21.312 --> 50:25.043
in the exact shape of a lightning bolt?

50:25.149 --> 50:27.447
It's my mark of power, cat.

50:27.551 --> 50:29.678
It's the mark of a makeup artist, dog.

50:29.787 --> 50:32.347
You're ridiculous. Now get down here.

50:34.225 --> 50:35.249
No.

50:35.359 --> 50:39.159
Mittens, so help me,
I will superbark you out of that tree.

50:39.263 --> 50:42.494
Yeah. Go nuts.
Let's see how that works out for you.

50:42.600 --> 50:44.625
You leave me no choice.

50:53.444 --> 50:58.814
Oh, the superbark. Scary, scary.
Yeah, that's really, really super.

51:01.285 --> 51:03.685
It's not true. It's just not true.

51:07.692 --> 51:10.593
Wow. That one felt really super.

51:11.095 --> 51:12.824
Wait. No, it didn't.

51:14.632 --> 51:18.659
Okay, okay. Mmm-hmm. I get the idea.
You could stop now.

51:18.769 --> 51:24.969
That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop.
I'm not kidding. Would you stop? It's...

51:29.413 --> 51:31.005
Okay, fine! You're a superdog.

51:31.115 --> 51:34.949
Bolt, be quiet, please!
Bolt, we gotta run!

51:35.953 --> 51:36.942
Bolt!

51:37.054 --> 51:38.351
Come here!

52:08.495 --> 52:14.559
Look who we found, young lady.
It's Bolt! They found him.

52:14.668 --> 52:15.657
Bolt!

52:15.769 --> 52:18.636
Yeah, that's right.
The little puppy dog.

52:23.926 --> 52:25.518
That is not Bolt.

52:26.762 --> 52:29.959
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

52:30.432 --> 52:34.528
You know, when I was little,
I wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

52:34.637 --> 52:37.299
but my parents got me
a baseball glove.

52:37.406 --> 52:39.465
So, you know what I did?

52:39.575 --> 52:44.069
I pretended that baseball glove
was a bicycle,

52:44.713 --> 52:47.147
and I rode it to school every day.

52:47.516 --> 52:48.847
True story.

52:49.518 --> 52:51.247
It's not him.

52:51.353 --> 52:53.218
I think it's him. I do.

52:54.790 --> 52:58.988
Thank you. Look, kid.
It's time we were honest with you.

52:59.094 --> 53:02.154
If we don't get back into production,
people are going to lose their jobs.

53:02.264 --> 53:03.925
Good people, with families.

53:04.033 --> 53:05.466
But Bolt's still out there, and...

53:05.567 --> 53:07.194
Now, we feel for you,

53:07.303 --> 53:09.464
and the last thing we wanna do
is ask a little girl

53:09.571 --> 53:12.904
to make a grown-up decision,
but it's come to that.

53:13.008 --> 53:14.942
We need you to move on.

53:15.978 --> 53:18.538
We need you to let Bolt go.

53:36.065 --> 53:37.123
Huh?

53:44.506 --> 53:48.340
Must be made of Styrofoam.

53:49.478 --> 53:52.572
No, no! No, no, no, please, please,
it can't end like this!

53:52.681 --> 53:55.707
Stop worrying, cat!
I'll get us out of here.

53:55.818 --> 54:00.084
You can't, Bolt! You got nothing!
No super strength, no superbark...

54:01.857 --> 54:03.552
And no heat vision.

54:04.026 --> 54:05.186
Listen to me, okay?

54:05.294 --> 54:09.230
We are being taken to a place where
humans go animal shopping, all right?

54:09.331 --> 54:12.528
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

54:12.634 --> 54:17.230
The ones that look like you, Bolt.
But the rest of us never come back out.

54:17.339 --> 54:20.137
I said I'll get us
out of here, all right?

54:24.279 --> 54:25.337
Ohhh!

54:29.918 --> 54:31.112
My hero.

54:46.368 --> 54:50.168
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny?

54:51.507 --> 54:54.032
I've been expecting your call.

55:29.044 --> 55:30.033
Ow!

55:30.145 --> 55:31.772
Would you
give it up already?

55:31.880 --> 55:34.974
You're liquefying
whatever brains you have left.

55:35.584 --> 55:41.580
I cannot be contained in any container.
You quitter. Watch this.

55:50.165 --> 55:52.224
I did it! I'm back!

55:53.769 --> 55:55.566
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

55:55.671 --> 55:57.696
Fully awesome!

55:57.806 --> 56:01.742
There's no truck that I know
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!

56:01.844 --> 56:04.904
Rhino? What are you doing here?

56:05.280 --> 56:07.612
Oh, nothing.
I was enjoying an evening stroll

56:07.716 --> 56:11.652
and thought I'd just pop the hatch
on that containment unit.

56:13.789 --> 56:15.256
You opened the door?

56:15.357 --> 56:17.086
Yes, I did!

56:18.427 --> 56:23.455
That's great, Rhino.
Yeah, that's really good.

56:23.565 --> 56:26.728
All right.
Let's go get the prisoner back.

56:42.951 --> 56:44.418
I can't do it.

56:47.489 --> 56:49.081
What did you say?

56:49.691 --> 56:50.885
I can't.

56:51.827 --> 56:53.124
Who are you?

56:53.228 --> 56:55.321
Rhino, you just don't under...

56:55.430 --> 56:57.921
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not a...

56:58.033 --> 57:01.059
Who singlehandedly destroyed
the Green-Eyed Man's undersea labs?

57:01.170 --> 57:02.159
Me, but...

57:02.271 --> 57:07.436
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

57:07.543 --> 57:10.103
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of it was...

57:10.212 --> 57:13.204
You! You can, Bolt,

57:13.315 --> 57:15.283
because all over this planet,

57:15.384 --> 57:18.353
there are animals
who feel like they can't.

57:19.054 --> 57:25.050
Like a little hamster who once spent
his days in an RV park,

57:25.561 --> 57:29.657
dreaming of the day when he, too,
would save a little girl from danger

57:29.765 --> 57:35.897
and be told, "You did it.
You did it, Rhino. You saved the day."

57:36.605 --> 57:38.732
They need a hero, Bolt.

57:38.840 --> 57:43.004
Someone who, no matter
what the odds, will do what's right.

57:43.111 --> 57:47.411
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible

57:47.549 --> 57:51.952
can become possible
if you're awesome!

57:53.855 --> 57:56.915
Well,
you're right about one thing, Rhino.

57:57.793 --> 57:59.784
Mittens does need a hero,

58:01.997 --> 58:03.328
and I guess I'll have to do.

58:03.432 --> 58:08.335
Such modesty!
Now, who's going to save that cat?

58:08.437 --> 58:10.405
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who!

58:10.505 --> 58:11.563
Me.

58:14.142 --> 58:15.769
I'll get my ball.

58:31.493 --> 58:32.824
Over there.

58:35.664 --> 58:37.063
There it is.

58:42.371 --> 58:46.740
This'll be just like the time you
infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!

58:47.943 --> 58:50.377
But it's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

58:50.479 --> 58:53.710
We're gonna have to do things
a little differently.

58:55.550 --> 58:57.450
Stealth mode.

59:01.490 --> 59:03.287
Good night, Ester.

59:03.392 --> 59:05.019
Good night, Lloyd.

59:11.667 --> 59:12.793
Lloyd?

59:15.871 --> 59:18.203
Lloyd Spoon,
you jump out and scare me,

59:18.307 --> 59:20.901
and I'm gonna pepper-spray you again!

59:24.846 --> 59:27.906
I swear, it's like I work with toddlers.

59:31.920 --> 59:34.184
Threat nullified.

59:38.493 --> 59:39.926
I feel alive.

59:40.028 --> 59:41.086
Shh!

59:45.667 --> 59:47.294
There's a guard.

59:47.402 --> 59:48.960
I'll snap his neck.

59:49.071 --> 59:51.005
We need to get him away
from that door.

59:51.106 --> 59:52.130
Oh!

59:59.047 --> 01:00:00.207
- Ball?
- Ball?

01:00:00.315 --> 01:00:01.577
- Ball?
- Ball?

01:00:01.683 --> 01:00:05.551
- Ball? Ball? Ball?
- Ball! Ball! Ball!

01:00:07.122 --> 01:00:11.354
I'm just... I'm read... I'm just...
Just pipe down!

01:00:23.972 --> 01:00:25.166
Mittens?

01:00:26.441 --> 01:00:30.574
Bolt? What are you doing here?

01:00:30.946 --> 01:00:32.470
I'm busting you out.

01:00:32.581 --> 01:00:37.018
You... You came all the way back here
for me?

01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:38.211
Yeah.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.380
But how'd you... I mean,
you don't have any superpowers.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.048
- I know.
- Really?

01:00:43.158 --> 01:00:46.321
- Yeah.
- Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?

01:00:46.428 --> 01:00:49.864
It's been a lot. Yes, it has.
Are you ready for this?

01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:51.796
- No.
- Me neither.

01:00:54.336 --> 01:00:58.796
Hey, hey, hey!
What is twisting your giblets?

01:00:58.907 --> 01:01:01.432
Hey, wait.
Where'd you get that hamster?

01:01:01.543 --> 01:01:03.238
Give it. Give it.

01:01:04.446 --> 01:01:05.538
Hey, wait!

01:01:05.647 --> 01:01:07.308
Initiating escape.

01:01:10.252 --> 01:01:11.446
Ow!

01:01:11.553 --> 01:01:13.145
What the... Hey!

01:01:14.623 --> 01:01:16.056
Lloyd! Block the door!

01:01:16.158 --> 01:01:18.058
Block the door, block the door,
block the door!

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.094
Superbark. Superbark!

01:01:43.552 --> 01:01:48.683
Sweet Sister Frances!
What did you do to my new truck?

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:49.757
You hold on right there!

01:01:51.426 --> 01:01:52.859
Golly, Ester!

01:01:54.095 --> 01:01:56.928
Both you boys need serious help!

01:01:57.032 --> 01:01:58.363
Spicy eyes!

01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.232
We need a ride.

01:02:03.338 --> 01:02:06.205
Ooh! I've got a big one. You're welcome.

01:02:22.657 --> 01:02:24.090
I can't believe it.

01:02:24.192 --> 01:02:28.288
My whole life I've wanted to see
a real live superbark.

01:02:29.965 --> 01:02:33.128
You are legendary.

01:02:45.714 --> 01:02:48.274
Mittens? lf...

01:02:49.484 --> 01:02:52.749
If I don't chase bad guys,
then what am I?

01:02:53.922 --> 01:02:55.412
I mean, what...

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.260
Ah, don't worry about it.

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:04.423
Being a regular dog is, like,
the greatest gig in the world. Okay?

01:03:04.866 --> 01:03:07.835
Look. I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

01:03:07.936 --> 01:03:10.200
A little-known cat secret.

01:03:10.305 --> 01:03:12.068
You know why we hate dogs?

01:03:12.173 --> 01:03:15.336
'Cause we wanna be dogs.
We have dog complexes.

01:03:16.211 --> 01:03:19.442
But what do dogs do?

01:03:19.548 --> 01:03:22.176
Slobber, sleep,
chase tails, chew shoes.

01:03:22.284 --> 01:03:24.582
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

01:03:24.686 --> 01:03:27.348
You know,
most dogs live in a place like this,

01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:30.356
and, well, I don't know.
They do things like...

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.983
Out of this? But... But...

01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:35.022
And this is your dog bowl.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:38.122
- What is?
- This. The entire floor.

01:03:38.233 --> 01:03:40.428
"It hits the ground,
it goes to the hound."

01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:41.832
How cool is that?

01:03:43.138 --> 01:03:46.471
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

01:03:47.976 --> 01:03:49.671
It doesn't get better than that.

01:03:49.778 --> 01:03:53.305
You... You seem to know a lot
about these places.

01:03:53.415 --> 01:03:55.406
Yeah, I did my time in one of these,

01:03:55.517 --> 01:03:57.781
but I'm more of an alley cat at heart,
you know?

01:03:57.886 --> 01:04:01.049
Sprung out first chance I got.
Never looked back.

01:04:01.156 --> 01:04:02.180
Hmm.

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:08.423
<i>Rhino is awesome!
He's so awesome!</i>

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:10.964
He's... He's beyond awesome!

01:04:11.066 --> 01:04:13.728
He... He's be-awesome!

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:16.164
He's...

01:04:17.005 --> 01:04:20.065
I... I am be-awesome.

01:04:23.178 --> 01:04:24.236
Mmm.

01:04:24.713 --> 01:04:25.702
Hmm!

01:04:25.814 --> 01:04:31.013
I think it's about time I introduced you
to the regular dog piece <i>de résistance.</i>

01:04:33.288 --> 01:04:34.687
Go ahead. Stick your head out.

01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:36.586
- Why?
- Just do it.

01:04:42.697 --> 01:04:45.222
This... This is awesome!

01:04:46.735 --> 01:04:48.862
And stick your tongue out.

01:04:53.274 --> 01:04:56.437
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:59.172
No, thanks. It's really a dog thing.

01:05:06.454 --> 01:05:10.686
<i>I have got so much to give</i>

01:05:11.393 --> 01:05:14.487
<i>I swear I do</i>

01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:18.796
<i>I may not have nine lives</i>

01:05:19.267 --> 01:05:22.794
<i>But this one feels brand-new</i>

01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:27.439
<i>Yes, I've lived a good one</i>

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:31.709
<i>I have tried to be true</i>

01:05:31.813 --> 01:05:36.978
<i>There are some things
I never realized</i>

01:05:37.085 --> 01:05:40.054
<i>Till I met you</i>

01:05:40.155 --> 01:05:47.118
<i>How the wind feels on my cheeks</i>

01:05:48.797 --> 01:05:55.168
<i>When I'm barking at the moon</i>

01:05:57.672 --> 01:06:01.904
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:06.777
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:06:10.385 --> 01:06:12.945
<i>Here I come</i>

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:17.155
<i>Back to you</i>

01:06:17.258 --> 01:06:21.558
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

01:06:21.663 --> 01:06:25.827
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:06:25.934 --> 01:06:31.031
<i>Well, I was in trouble bad</i>

01:06:31.139 --> 01:06:34.597
<i>I was so confused</i>

01:06:34.709 --> 01:06:38.941
<i>I may not see in color, babe</i>

01:06:39.047 --> 01:06:43.507
<i>But I sure can feel blue</i>

01:06:43.618 --> 01:06:48.112
<i>I have been a lot of things</i>

01:06:48.223 --> 01:06:51.590
<i>They may not all be true</i>

01:06:51.693 --> 01:06:57.029
<i>My experience was so mysterious</i>

01:06:57.132 --> 01:07:00.192
<i>Till I met you</i>

01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:07.207
<i>Now the sun will rise in the east</i>

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:15.540
<i>But I'm barking at the moon</i>

01:07:17.819 --> 01:07:22.051
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

01:07:22.157 --> 01:07:26.526
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:07:30.498 --> 01:07:33.126
<i>Here I come</i>

01:07:34.869 --> 01:07:37.064
<i>Back to you</i>

01:07:37.172 --> 01:07:41.438
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

01:07:41.543 --> 01:07:45.741
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:07:45.847 --> 01:07:50.079
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

01:07:50.185 --> 01:07:54.349
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:07:54.455 --> 01:08:00.985
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

01:08:01.095 --> 01:08:07.864
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:08:17.283 --> 01:08:19.308
Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up.

01:08:20.886 --> 01:08:23.514
Come on. I've got a surprise for you.

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:30.294
Okay, okay. No peeking.
All right, now, open them.

01:08:33.432 --> 01:08:36.196
- Bask in the glow, baby.
- I...

01:08:36.736 --> 01:08:39.102
Just let me give you the grand tour.
Okay?

01:08:39.205 --> 01:08:43.971
This one, this one's mine,
and this one is all yours.

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:45.698
Mittens, I...

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:48.041
I found this really soft pillow thing
for you.

01:08:48.147 --> 01:08:51.412
And get this. I found some Styrofoam,
and I stuffed it inside,

01:08:51.517 --> 01:08:53.348
which I thought was both
kind of creative and ironic.

01:08:53.452 --> 01:08:54.441
You know what I mean?

01:08:54.553 --> 01:08:55.814
- Mittens, I don't think that...
- Ooh! Ooh!

01:08:55.921 --> 01:09:01.223
Check it out. Total privacy,
and completely soundproof.

01:09:01.327 --> 01:09:02.589
Yeah, well, I don't think that I...

01:09:02.694 --> 01:09:04.720
Okay, I lied. It's not soundproof.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:07.731
- But you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

01:09:10.202 --> 01:09:11.294
What?

01:09:11.404 --> 01:09:13.837
We're one waffle away from Penny.

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:17.509
You're still going back to her?

01:09:18.644 --> 01:09:20.839
Mittens, she's my person.

01:09:23.314 --> 01:09:24.680
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:26.011
Ear, ear.

01:09:28.754 --> 01:09:31.691
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:34.558
Now, how about this? Is that real?

01:09:35.194 --> 01:09:39.460
Does this look real to you? Or that?
Is that real? Or that?

01:09:40.032 --> 01:09:44.069
How about that, Bolt? She's an actress.

01:09:44.437 --> 01:09:46.598
She's just pretending.

01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:48.268
Not Penny.

01:09:48.374 --> 01:09:52.207
There is no Penny. She's fake.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.801
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

01:09:53.912 --> 01:09:57.508
No, no, Bolt.
That's what they do, okay?

01:09:57.616 --> 01:10:01.017
They act like they love you.
They act like they'll be there forever,

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.055
and then one day they'll pack up
all their stuff and move away

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.317
and take their love with them,

01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:09.952
and leave their declawed cat behind
to fend for herself!

01:10:15.735 --> 01:10:21.935
They leave her wondering
what she did wrong.

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:25.838
I...

01:10:28.214 --> 01:10:30.079
I'm sorry, Mittens,

01:10:32.351 --> 01:10:34.216
but Penny is different.

01:10:36.956 --> 01:10:38.184
Then go.

01:10:40.392 --> 01:10:42.986
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt.

01:10:43.896 --> 01:10:46.387
I never should've taken pity on you.

01:10:47.466 --> 01:10:50.128
- Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

01:10:59.278 --> 01:11:01.143
You take care, Mittens.

01:11:38.284 --> 01:11:41.742
That meat lover's pizza
is not loving me back at all.

01:11:43.155 --> 01:11:44.952
Hey there, Rhino.

01:11:45.057 --> 01:11:46.615
Morning, cat.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.393
Where's Bolt?

01:11:49.995 --> 01:11:51.155
He's...

01:11:53.032 --> 01:11:54.499
He's gone.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.329
Bolt left?

01:11:57.136 --> 01:12:01.232
Yeah, but he instructed me to tell you

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:05.868
that he had to face
the Green-Eyed Man alone.

01:12:09.782 --> 01:12:10.771
Whoa!

01:12:10.883 --> 01:12:13.351
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

01:12:13.452 --> 01:12:15.750
But he doesn't need us anymore.

01:12:16.388 --> 01:12:19.721
Trust me,
I've seen it a million times before.

01:12:19.825 --> 01:12:21.952
In the cold, dark
night before the battle,

01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:26.430
when the steely fangs of evil
are sharpened and poised to strike,

01:12:26.532 --> 01:12:30.024
the hero must go
and face his greatest challenge alone.

01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:33.632
But if Bolt's taught me anything,

01:12:33.739 --> 01:12:37.505
it's that you never abandon a friend
in a time of need.

01:12:38.344 --> 01:12:41.177
When your teammate's in trouble,
you go.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.044
Whether they ask or not, you go,

01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:46.174
not knowing if you're coming back
dead or alive...

01:12:46.285 --> 01:12:48.378
He went the other way.

01:12:48.487 --> 01:12:49.454
You go!

01:12:49.555 --> 01:12:53.582
Knowing how deep the shrapnel's
going to pierce your hide, you go.

01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:18.609
Penny.

01:13:20.686 --> 01:13:25.089
No way. Wow. Bolt.
I'm a really big fan of yours, brother.

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:26.817
I'm Blake.
This is my writing partner, Tom.

01:13:26.926 --> 01:13:28.325
- Tom, say what's up.
- What's up?

01:13:28.427 --> 01:13:29.951
- Wow!
- Oh, no.

01:13:30.062 --> 01:13:31.996
Oh. And this is our
personal assistant, Billy,

01:13:32.097 --> 01:13:33.826
who was supposed
to wait up on the wire.

01:13:33.933 --> 01:13:35.400
Bolt, I've admired you
for such a long time,

01:13:35.501 --> 01:13:36.934
and there's something
I've always wanted to tell you

01:13:37.036 --> 01:13:38.367
if I ever got a chance to meet you,
and now it's...

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:40.199
Okay, Billy, that was horrifying,
what you just did.

01:13:40.306 --> 01:13:41.330
Why don't you make yourself useful.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.499
Go get me some breadcrumbs,
whole grain. Go.

01:13:43.609 --> 01:13:45.509
Whole wheat is not the same thing
as whole grain, Billy!

01:13:45.611 --> 01:13:47.340
- Not the same, Billy.
- Do not come at me with whole wheat!

01:13:47.446 --> 01:13:48.743
Or pumpernickel, Billy!

01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:51.111
Okay, guys, but I really gotta get going.

01:13:51.216 --> 01:13:53.309
I know. I know you're a busy dog,
but if you've got a second,

01:13:53.419 --> 01:13:55.114
we'd love to pitch you an idea
for your show.

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.450
Tom's better at pitching.
I'll let him take it from here.

01:13:57.556 --> 01:13:59.353
Tommy's got the spotlight.

01:14:02.294 --> 01:14:03.784
Wait for it.

01:14:05.664 --> 01:14:07.928
- Aliens.
- Oh, snap!

01:14:08.033 --> 01:14:11.093
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

01:14:11.203 --> 01:14:13.467
- Holler back!
- It'll be huge, man. Huge.

01:14:13.572 --> 01:14:15.267
You can't touch us.

01:14:15.507 --> 01:14:17.134
Uh...

01:14:17.242 --> 01:14:19.437
I love it. But I'll tell you what.

01:14:19.545 --> 01:14:23.777
If you guys can help me find Penny,
that girl from the television show,

01:14:23.882 --> 01:14:28.114
well, I'd love to hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.244
We got a nibble.

01:14:29.355 --> 01:14:32.449
Don't freak out.
This is how you blew it with Nemo.

01:14:32.558 --> 01:14:35.994
We open, exterior, outer space,
late morning...

01:14:36.829 --> 01:14:39.195
...a fiery comet to reveal Penny...

01:14:39.298 --> 01:14:41.858
...faced by a man-eating squid!

01:14:50.909 --> 01:14:54.436
And as the tractor beam is pulling
Penny towards the alien mother ship,

01:14:54.546 --> 01:14:55.945
we fade to black.

01:14:56.048 --> 01:14:58.380
And we have a great pop song
for the end credits.

01:14:58.484 --> 01:15:00.952
Talk to your people.
We're ready to move on this.

01:15:01.053 --> 01:15:02.645
He's so on board!

01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:12.895
There it is!

01:15:16.769 --> 01:15:19.363
The most terrifying place on Earth.

01:15:34.086 --> 01:15:35.815
Hello.
How are you doing today?

01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:38.257
Hi. I'm here to see Joe Mateo.

01:15:39.691 --> 01:15:44.651
At long last, we've arrived
at the belly of the beast.

01:15:44.763 --> 01:15:48.631
The lair of the Green-Eyed Man!

01:15:48.734 --> 01:15:50.224
Rhino! Hold up!

01:15:52.104 --> 01:15:53.196
Hold up!

01:15:53.305 --> 01:15:56.001
Why? What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

01:15:56.775 --> 01:16:01.576
Listen, this may be
really hard for you to understand,

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.649
but, you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:07.514
I mean, sometimes, sometimes
you think something's really real

01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:09.018
and it's not. And sometimes...

01:16:09.121 --> 01:16:12.454
All of my training has prepared me
for this moment.

01:16:12.558 --> 01:16:13.752
This is complicated.

01:16:13.859 --> 01:16:15.850
Die! Die!

01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:20.830
Prepare yourself,
foul man-beast,

01:16:20.933 --> 01:16:23.834
for I will beat your pancreas
with your spleen,

01:16:23.936 --> 01:16:26.234
and then I will rip your liver
out of your...

01:16:28.507 --> 01:16:31.670
You're so cute with your little whiskers.

01:16:32.244 --> 01:16:34.906
I had a hamster just like you
when I was a kid.

01:16:35.013 --> 01:16:37.573
His name was Mr. Sparkles.

01:17:05.344 --> 01:17:06.402
Bolt?

01:17:08.914 --> 01:17:10.882
Bolt! You're okay!

01:17:12.684 --> 01:17:14.276
You came back.

01:17:23.128 --> 01:17:25.790
Bolt, I thought I lost you.

01:17:38.977 --> 01:17:40.706
You're my good boy.

01:18:06.338 --> 01:18:07.362
Good boy.

01:18:07.472 --> 01:18:11.306
Okay, people. Let's move it
to stage seven and do it for real.

01:18:19.017 --> 01:18:20.109
I miss him.

01:18:20.219 --> 01:18:23.711
I know, honey. I do, too.

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:29.059
First positions, please.

01:18:40.172 --> 01:18:42.538
Okay, hold still for me, sweetie.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.952
Fifteen, take one. Mark.

01:18:57.055 --> 01:18:58.955
And action.

01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:10.225
Ah!

01:19:10.335 --> 01:19:15.272
Professor, I'd like to thank you
for granting us access

01:19:15.374 --> 01:19:19.538
to that labyrinthian mind of yours.

01:19:19.645 --> 01:19:22.239
You know I'd never do such a thing.

01:19:22.347 --> 01:19:28.911
Unless it was the only way
to save your little girl's life!

01:19:29.021 --> 01:19:30.010
Penny!

01:19:30.122 --> 01:19:33.455
Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!

01:19:33.558 --> 01:19:36.322
Your dog is nowhere near...

01:19:41.099 --> 01:19:43.192
Get that dog!

01:19:47.839 --> 01:19:51.798
Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy. Come here.

01:19:58.317 --> 01:20:01.150
Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!

01:20:07.626 --> 01:20:09.184
Hey, Wags.

01:20:10.862 --> 01:20:13.956
Mittens? What are you doing here?

01:20:14.066 --> 01:20:15.260
Long story short,

01:20:15.367 --> 01:20:19.235
I was tied to a delusional dog
and dragged across the country.

01:20:19.338 --> 01:20:20.999
But that is not important now.

01:20:21.106 --> 01:20:24.667
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:27.336
And why aren't you in there?

01:20:28.413 --> 01:20:30.813
You were right about her, Mittens.

01:20:32.217 --> 01:20:35.744
She... Well, it wasn't real.

01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:39.613
No, Bolt. It is real.
I was in there just now.

01:20:39.725 --> 01:20:43.456
I saw her face after you left.
She's brokenhearted.

01:20:45.097 --> 01:20:48.123
She doesn't want just any dog.
She loves you.

01:20:49.968 --> 01:20:54.564
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

01:20:59.411 --> 01:21:00.776
Bolt, you're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

01:21:00.879 --> 01:21:02.847
Mittens, be quiet.

01:21:02.948 --> 01:21:04.245
No. You need to hear this.

01:21:04.349 --> 01:21:06.408
No, no seriously. Be quiet.

01:21:07.853 --> 01:21:09.184
What is it?

01:21:10.989 --> 01:21:11.978
Penny.

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:15.321
Help! Please, help! Help!

01:21:15.427 --> 01:21:16.655
Hold on!

01:21:18.163 --> 01:21:19.926
Please! Help!

01:21:35.614 --> 01:21:36.876
Oh, my gosh, the stage!

01:21:36.982 --> 01:21:39.584
Yeah. You better run.

01:21:42.487 --> 01:21:43.784
I'm on your six.

01:21:43.889 --> 01:21:44.878
What do we do?

01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:47.720
Just make sure
I get inside that building.

01:21:50.061 --> 01:21:51.463
Bolt?

01:21:53.765 --> 01:21:54.891
Is anyone still in there?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.524
I don't know.

01:21:59.538 --> 01:22:01.028
Coming through.

01:22:04.576 --> 01:22:07.636
It's a good day to die!

01:22:07.746 --> 01:22:09.680
Not on my watch, rodent.

01:22:38.877 --> 01:22:40.003
Bolt!

01:22:54.059 --> 01:22:55.959
I knew you'd come back.

01:23:17.415 --> 01:23:19.508
Bolt. Zoom, zoom.

01:23:55.186 --> 01:23:56.346
Bolt.

01:23:58.924 --> 01:24:01.586
Bolt, just go on out.

01:24:03.695 --> 01:24:04.719
Go.

01:24:06.831 --> 01:24:08.298
It'll be okay.

01:24:17.075 --> 01:24:18.872
You're my good boy.

01:24:20.512 --> 01:24:21.911
I love you.

01:24:32.557 --> 01:24:35.788
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:07.151
Hey, did you hear that?

01:25:07.258 --> 01:25:08.247
Yeah.
- What is that?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.351
Quiet. Everyone be quiet.

01:25:17.702 --> 01:25:19.636
It's the superbark!

01:25:20.972 --> 01:25:23.440
- It's coming from over there!
- Go, go, go!

01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:25.566
Come on, let's go!

01:25:37.822 --> 01:25:41.451
Over here! We found them.
They're here. We found them!

01:25:45.664 --> 01:25:49.361
All right, we got an RT coming
through, people. Make a hole!

01:25:49.467 --> 01:25:50.798
<i>For your own safety,</i>

01:25:50.902 --> 01:25:53.234
<i>keep moving away
from the building.</i>

01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:01.778
- Bolt.
- I gotta get through. Sweetie!

01:26:02.847 --> 01:26:06.874
You're okay. You gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

01:26:06.985 --> 01:26:11.285
She's stable, but we're gonna
take her to the hospital just to be safe.

01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:22.227
I'm so sorry this happened.

01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:24.426
I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.

01:26:24.536 --> 01:26:28.165
No mother should ever have to go
through something like this,

01:26:28.273 --> 01:26:33.836
but I promise you
we're going to make this work for us.

01:26:33.945 --> 01:26:38.314
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit.

01:26:38.416 --> 01:26:40.350
This is so great!

01:26:41.453 --> 01:26:42.477
Ow!

01:26:44.355 --> 01:26:46.152
We quit.

01:26:46.257 --> 01:26:49.522
No, no! Wait!
Let's not make any rash decisions.

01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:52.253
Let's put a pin in it.

01:27:04.342 --> 01:27:07.402
I'm afraid your injuries
were more severe

01:27:07.512 --> 01:27:09.912
than we had previously thought,
my dear.

01:27:10.014 --> 01:27:13.541
We had to completely reconstruct
your face.

01:27:16.054 --> 01:27:17.453
Have a look.

01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:24.952
Well, at least Calico
won't be able to recognize me.

01:27:28.967 --> 01:27:30.798
Calico!

01:27:43.181 --> 01:27:44.239
Bolt!

01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:06.530
Aliens.

01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:13.439
That is totally unrealistic.

01:28:14.279 --> 01:28:16.440
Absolutely ridonculous.

01:28:16.548 --> 01:28:19.847
You could say that again. Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.

01:28:19.951 --> 01:28:23.853
Over. Yeah, that's the spot.

01:28:33.832 --> 01:28:35.629
Hey, silly doggy.

01:28:41.406 --> 01:28:45.035
That's a keeper.
You wanna go play outside?

01:28:45.143 --> 01:28:48.169
You wanna go play outside? Let's go!

01:29:01.359 --> 01:29:03.486
Does that dog look familiar?

01:29:03.595 --> 01:29:07.463
Nope.
I never seen him before in my life.

01:29:13.805 --> 01:29:14.794
Come on.

01:29:16.274 --> 01:29:18.105
Bolt! Come on, buddy!

01:29:18.209 --> 01:29:22.509
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>Like the one you've got</i>

01:29:22.614 --> 01:29:29.417
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

01:29:51.676 --> 01:29:53.803
<i>Nobody listens to me</i>

01:29:53.912 --> 01:29:56.107
<i>Don't hear a single
thing I've said</i>

01:29:56.214 --> 01:29:58.512
<i>Say anything to soothe me</i>

01:29:58.616 --> 01:30:00.914
<i>Anything to get you from my head</i>

01:30:01.019 --> 01:30:02.816
<i>Don't know how I really feel</i>

01:30:02.921 --> 01:30:05.583
<i>The faith it takes</i>
<i>to make like I don't care</i>

01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:07.385
<i>Don't know how much it hurts</i>

01:30:07.492 --> 01:30:09.926
<i>To turn around</i>
<i>like you were never there</i>

01:30:10.028 --> 01:30:13.464
<i>Like somehow you could be replaced</i>

01:30:14.966 --> 01:30:18.959
<i>And I could walk away</i>
<i>from the promises we made</i>

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:21.834
<i>And swore we'd never break</i>

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.407
- <i>I thought I lost you</i>
- <i>I thought I lost you</i>

01:30:23.508 --> 01:30:26.375
<i>When you ran away
to try to find me</i>

01:30:26.477 --> 01:30:31.073
<i>I thought I'd never see</i>
<i>your sweet face again</i>

01:30:31.182 --> 01:30:35.619
<i>I turned around and you were gone</i>
<i>And on and on the days went</i>

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.214
<i>But I kept the moments
that we were in</i>

01:30:40.325 --> 01:30:44.056
<i>'Cause I hoped in my heart</i>
<i>you'd come back to me, my friend</i>

01:30:44.162 --> 01:30:46.528
<i>And now I got you</i>

01:30:48.499 --> 01:30:51.627
<i>But I thought I lost you</i>

01:30:54.339 --> 01:30:56.864
<i>I felt so empty out there</i>

01:30:56.975 --> 01:30:59.068
<i>And there were days
I had my doubts</i>

01:30:59.177 --> 01:31:01.202
<i>But I knew I'd find you somewhere</i>

01:31:01.312 --> 01:31:03.872
<i>'Cause I knew I
couldn't live without</i>

01:31:03.982 --> 01:31:06.974
<i>You in my life for one more day</i>

01:31:08.486 --> 01:31:10.545
<i>And I swore I'd never break those</i>

01:31:10.655 --> 01:31:13.146
- <i>Promises we made</i>
- <i>Promises we made</i>

01:31:13.257 --> 01:31:17.717
<i>I thought I lost you</i>
<i>When you ran away to try to find me</i>

01:31:17.829 --> 01:31:22.232
<i>I thought I'd never see</i>
<i>your sweet face again</i>

01:31:22.333 --> 01:31:26.929
<i>I turned around and you were gone</i>
<i>And on and on the days went</i>

01:31:27.038 --> 01:31:31.532

01:31:31.642 --> 01:31:35.339

01:31:39.951 --> 01:31:42.818
<i>But I thought I lost you</i>

01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:47.483
<i>I told myself I wouldn't sleep</i>

01:31:47.592 --> 01:31:51.653
<i>Till I'd searched the world</i>
<i>from sea to sea</i>

01:31:54.866 --> 01:31:59.235
<i>I made a wish upon a star</i>
<i>I turned around and there you were</i>

01:31:59.337 --> 01:32:02.534
- <i>Now here we are</i>
- <i>Now here we are</i>

01:32:05.276 --> 01:32:06.800
<i>Here we are</i>

01:32:06.911 --> 01:32:08.003
<i>I thought I lost you</i>

01:32:08.112 --> 01:32:10.672
<i>I thought I lost you, too</i>

01:32:11.682 --> 01:32:12.671
<i>I thought I lost you</i>

01:32:12.784 --> 01:32:14.547
<i>I thought I lost you</i>

01:32:14.652 --> 01:32:16.119
<i>Yeah</i>

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:20.816
<i>I thought I lost you</i>
<i>When you ran away to try to find me</i>

01:32:20.925 --> 01:32:25.294

01:32:52.356 --> 01:32:55.951
<i>So glad I got you, got you</i>

01:32:56.961 --> 01:33:01.022
<i>So glad I got you</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:33:06.404 --> 01:33:09.669
