00:06.006 --> 00:07.591
<i>At some point in history,</i>

00:07.591 --> 00:10.594
<i>one being fashioned a small orb
and said to another being...</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:12.513
I bet I could kick this orb past you.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.889
Sure. Why not?

00:13.889 --> 00:15.807
<i>Beings loved the idea so much,</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:19.144
<i>they dedicated an entire field
to their orb-kicking activity.</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:22.105
<i>Then spectator beings became
emotionally invested</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:23.649
<i>in the outcome of the kicks.</i>

00:23.649 --> 00:25.234
Score the orb. Score the orb.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.402
Goal!

00:27.402 --> 00:28.737
- Goal!
- Goal!

00:28.737 --> 00:30.364
<i>They became so invested,</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:32.991
<i>beings began proving their devotion
to their favorite teams</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.243
<i>by getting ink stains</i>

00:34.243 --> 00:37.496
<i>and spending currency to be present
as their team wins.</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:38.872
<i>Or loses.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:40.958
I regret my emotional investment.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.501
<i>Regardless of outcome,</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:44.878
<i>these games
are intended to bring beings together.</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:47.047
<i>However, this is not always the case.</i>

00:53.679 --> 00:56.431
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.225
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

00:58.976 --> 01:01.645
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

01:01.645 --> 01:03.272
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:06.483
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:09.444
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:11.780
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.449
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:17.077
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

01:30.549 --> 01:32.926
<i>It is a halfway, re-energizing recess.</i>

01:34.386 --> 01:37.764
- Nothing to be disappointed about yet.
- Well, we aren't losing.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.100
That's a win in my book.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.686
Hello, sibling.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.770
You're late.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.482
I may be late, but at least I brought
our elderly lifegiver something.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.443
I don't have to bring anything.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.653
They appreciate my company
more than yours.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.363
I don't miss these talks.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.615
You and me both.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.408
My baby.

01:56.408 --> 02:01.079
You are as sweet as the cocoslab
you always bring me.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.665
Why don't we get back
to the footorb match?

02:04.166 --> 02:06.043
Can't we watch something else for once?

02:06.043 --> 02:10.214
There's supposed to be a really beautiful
documentary about wild creatures on.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.298
No way.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.218
This is a match against our archrivals,
the Newts.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.302
They're right.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.428
This is a big match.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.306
It's tradition to root for
our local region's team.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.016
No matter how terrible they are.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.352
Fine. If that is what you both want.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.355
But you're missing out
on the wonders of nature.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.943
We will return to the Beingsburg Howlers
versus the New Placefield Newts

02:30.943 --> 02:33.237
after a quick word from our sponsors.

02:33.904 --> 02:37.407
<i>Hey. You may be familiar with me
as a professional orb-kicker.</i>

02:39.618 --> 02:42.454
<i>But I'm also an outer void explorer</i>

02:42.454 --> 02:46.041
<i>and a flying machine operator
and a professional orb smacker.</i>

02:46.041 --> 02:48.043
<i>Through the power of books.</i>

02:48.836 --> 02:52.256
<i>I don't know. If this interests you,
come on down to the library.</i>

02:53.465 --> 02:54.716
<i>Borrow today.</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:57.135
<i>And then bring it back,
even if you didn't read it.</i>

02:57.135 --> 02:58.220
<i>There's no shame.</i>

02:58.220 --> 02:59.304
<i>What a place.</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:01.723
I think they are missing
their target audience here.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.809
Yeah, I don't know.
You're here, aren't you?

03:03.809 --> 03:06.186
There is nothing wrong with reading.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.313
But it would be nice
if you put your book down

03:08.313 --> 03:10.190
and root for the Howlers with us.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.442
I think you'll genuinely enjoy it.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.527
Yay.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.862
Go Howlers.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.910
These two teams
really keep you on your toes.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.329
You aren't kidding.
With this much running and concentration,

03:24.329 --> 03:25.831
they may as well put us on the team.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.667
If only we made the same amount
of currency as the players.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.545
<i>The officials are
hard at work deliberating the call.</i>

03:31.545 --> 03:34.006
Beings don't have posters of us
on their wall at home.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.924
Such is our lot.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.342
The call is a handorb, right?

03:37.342 --> 03:40.345
Don't they know it's called footorb?
Why touch it with their hand?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.015
<i>It looks like Newts number 41</i>

03:43.015 --> 03:45.225
<i>has committed a handorb infraction.</i>

03:48.645 --> 03:50.355
This is their chance.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.567
Yeah. Chance to get upset
like you do every match.

03:53.567 --> 03:58.530
True. But there is also a chance
of extreme elation, which is worth it.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.824
You clearly don't know
what you're missing.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.118
<i>The Howlers are
streaking down the field.</i>

04:03.118 --> 04:04.203
Yes!

04:04.203 --> 04:06.079
<i>But now the Newts steal the orb.</i>

04:06.079 --> 04:07.372
No.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.091
- Ref, please.
- Deception.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.265
<i>And a very late whistle.</i>

04:25.265 --> 04:27.226
<i>This referee needs to get
their eyes checked.</i>

04:27.226 --> 04:29.728
That player clearly put on
a theatrical performance.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.230
The game should be over.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.025
What's the call?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.610
The birds obstructed my view.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.907
- But I think that being was tripped?
- I didn't have an angle on it.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.076
But if that's what you think,
listen to your gut.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.702
What do you think, gut?

04:47.996 --> 04:48.997
Tripped it is.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.874
Player was tripped.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.252
Play results in an unbothered kick.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.421
<i>An unbothered kick
for the Newts at the end of stoppage time.</i>

04:56.421 --> 04:57.714
- <i>Can you believe it?</i>
- What?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.342
<i>I can't, and I'm usually so gullible.</i>

05:00.342 --> 05:02.386
<i>And the kick is in.</i>

05:02.970 --> 05:04.346
<i>That's it. It's over.</i>

05:04.346 --> 05:06.390
<i>The ref blew the game.</i>

05:06.390 --> 05:09.184
Referees are highly trained
in bird-related obstructions,

05:09.184 --> 05:12.145
so they are expected
to make a reasonable judgment.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.439
That gut check was way off the mark.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.108
What an upsetting turn of events.

05:16.108 --> 05:19.611
But this is why beings invest in footorb:
the drama.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.865
Bad judgment! Bad judgment! Bad judgment!

05:24.074 --> 05:27.160
<i>That referee should definitely
consider a new occupation.</i>

05:27.661 --> 05:28.745
All eyes are on them,

05:28.745 --> 05:31.790
and their eyes were anywhere
except where they needed to be.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.794
The Howler fans at home
must be absolutely devastated.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.254
I'm devastated.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.714
Classic Howlers.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.842
Always finding new ways
to break our blood pump.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.178
This is an all-time emotional low.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.471
Well, at least it was
completely self-inflicted.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.890
The Newts are the worst.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.391
Newts are pretty great actually.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.643
Just like many creatures,
they're super adaptable.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.061
You could learn a lot from them.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.148
Yeah.
And if you spent more time with beings,

05:56.148 --> 05:59.735
you'd learn to identify when they want
to hear facts about creatures,

05:59.735 --> 06:00.944
which is almost never,

06:00.944 --> 06:03.697
unless you're referring to
specific footorb teams.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.701
Creatures are more important
than watching beings kick an orb around.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.370
They live in the equivalent
of a single-elimination tournament

06:10.370 --> 06:12.039
where the losing team is eaten.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.123
Enough!

06:13.123 --> 06:17.294
I am an old being now,
and it won't be long until I perish.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.962
So please, stop bickering.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.047
You're perishing?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.757
Of course. I'm old.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.717
I could perish at any moment.

06:23.717 --> 06:28.347
And if you're not friends before I perish,
it will be the cause of my perishing.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.932
That doesn't make any sense.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.935
Whatever relationship we're meant to have
is the one we have right now.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.853
I accept them
in spite of their shortcomings.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.147
Like being
a detrimentally obsessive footorb fan.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.484
And I accept them for wishing
they were born a wild creature.

06:40.484 --> 06:41.568
Isn't that enough?

06:41.568 --> 06:42.653
No!

06:42.653 --> 06:45.739
Make some plans
for sibling-togetherness time.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.575
To learn about each other's interests.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.704
<i>And a brutal ending tonight
for the Howlers.</i>

06:52.704 --> 06:53.956
<i>Let's take another look.</i>

06:56.208 --> 06:58.877
<i>Those birds are not pleased
that we built a stadium</i>

06:58.877 --> 07:00.337
<i>over their natural habitat.</i>

07:00.337 --> 07:02.714
<i>I surely wouldn't want to be the ref--</i>

07:03.465 --> 07:04.716
Don't listen to them.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.760
These things happen to the best of us.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.804
I let everybody down.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.514
Well, that's not true.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.391
You only let half the fans down.

07:12.391 --> 07:16.478
I appreciate the consolation,
but I clearly made the wrong call.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.731
Now I can't even make a decision
on which foot tubes to wear.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.234
Well, how about we
make the next few for you?

07:23.527 --> 07:24.528
Put these on.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.780
We're going to The Sloppy Jug
for mild poison.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.699
Gimme that mild poison!

07:30.868 --> 07:32.411
To the best referee we know

07:32.411 --> 07:36.206
and the unfortunate circumstance
reminding us all of our fallibility.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.918
No amount of mild poison's
going to alleviate this feeling of dread

07:39.918 --> 07:41.879
for tomorrow's postgame review.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.923
What's the worst that can happen?
You're asked to find a new occupation?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.466
Or you suddenly perish.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.013
I'm done for.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.723
Sorry we're not good consolers.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.933
We're referees. We call it like we see it.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.437
Which in your case
wasn't necessarily true?

07:58.437 --> 08:00.981
Again, not good consolers. Sorry.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.274
You don't have to worry.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.525
I've done way worse.

08:03.525 --> 08:07.112
I once forgot I was a referee
and received a pass and scored a goal.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.906
That has to be deception.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.073
It was in a dream,

08:10.073 --> 08:13.785
and the postgame review board
kept saying how great my kick was.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.955
I don't think the board is gonna
celebrate my missed call.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.040
You'll be fine.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.083
We'll be sending you positive thoughts.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.919
Excuse me, ref.

08:23.086 --> 08:27.633
Seeing you fail in front of
so many beings, it was beautiful.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.134
Gratitude.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.138
I'm only here to appease Lifegiver.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.182
I don't need that guilt on my conscience.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.226
Nice to see you too.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.309
Follow me.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.563
This part of Beingsburg is protected land.

08:41.563 --> 08:45.776
It's possible some plants on this mountain
are over a millennium old.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.986
Wow. Old trees. How thrilling.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.071
I get it.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.114
It's easy to take this place for granted.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.659
We beings get so caught up
in our daily lives

08:53.659 --> 08:56.370
that we tend to overlook
anything that isn't in front of us.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.705
Well, if you think staring at a forest
is exciting,

08:58.705 --> 09:00.290
just wait till you try footorb.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.334
We've only touched the surface here.

09:02.334 --> 09:05.128
The more you see,
the more enlightening it will be.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.130
Focusing only on trees

09:07.130 --> 09:10.592
is like only paying attention
to the grass on the footorb field.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.011
Try to see the full picture.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.346
We're in the woods.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.682
All I see are trees and creatures.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.518
I don't know how you could
possibly relate this to footorb.

09:19.518 --> 09:22.729
I like to think about how being here
is like taking a step back in time.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.107
This was the creatures' land
way before beings lived here,

09:25.107 --> 09:26.942
and they live now just as they did then.

09:27.484 --> 09:31.196
There's simultaneously cooperation
and conflict in nature,

09:31.196 --> 09:35.492
which results in a beautiful harmony,
much like your beloved footorb.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.203
So you expect me to believe
that creatures and plants

09:38.203 --> 09:40.289
function like footorb players?

09:40.289 --> 09:41.456
Yeah. Exactly.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.127
Stay back.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.881
These howlers are defending
their territory while seeking prey.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.132
It's two on three.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.675
Those whitetails are goners.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.760
Will the howlers get their prey?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.430
The whitetails move to break free.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.892
Did you see that?
That whitetail just juked that howler.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.101
Now you're getting it.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.020
The howlers coordinate
a new plan of attack,

10:03.020 --> 10:05.480
but the whitetails are prepared
with their strong defense.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.733
This is clearly
not their first encounter.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.197
Even these howlers
somehow found a way to lose.

10:13.197 --> 10:15.157
Can't say I saw that coming.

10:17.034 --> 10:21.371
Thanks for showing a genuine interest
in something that is actually interesting.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.624
Don't thank me yet.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.376
I'm about to make you run
a ton of footorb drills.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.837
So, do you think the creatures
taught us orb games,

10:28.837 --> 10:31.089
or do you think the reason
we invented orb games

10:31.089 --> 10:33.217
is so that we wouldn't fight
and hurt each other?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.135
I'm sure it's a little bit of both.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.014
Why don't you join us?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.184
What are you both doing here?

10:42.184 --> 10:43.977
We wanted to be here to support you.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.062
You got this.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.189
Let's get right to it.

10:47.189 --> 10:51.193
You blew a call that directly affected
the outcome of a match.

10:51.193 --> 10:55.906
We have to make appropriate corrections
to ensure that doesn't happen again.

10:55.906 --> 11:00.661
So we must ask you
to attend recertification.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.998
Please, relinquish your whistle,
to be returned upon passing the test.

11:06.625 --> 11:11.004
If they have to go to recertification,
then you have to send us too!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.089
Silence.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.258
No.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.051
We need you to referee the next match.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.761
Well, you're on your own.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.137
Are they being demoted?

11:19.137 --> 11:21.348
Not at all. Unless they fail.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.600
Then they're worse than demoted.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.310
They're fired.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.187
But you shouldn't worry about that.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.731
You're a great referee,
and we all believe in you.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.071
This is so invigorating.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.907
I see now
why you are so passionate about it.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.117
All right.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.994
Let's try some shots on goal then.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.913
Great, this should really
take things up a notch.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.625
Oh, yeah.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.586
Beginner's luck.

11:50.586 --> 11:51.670
Kick it back.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.005
Let's test that theory.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.174
Am I sensing enjoyment?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.092
I enjoy being better than you.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.138
I guess it was luck.

12:01.138 --> 12:04.474
If you want to get it by me,
you'll have to kick it harder than that.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.018
Challenge accepted.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.522
What the rorb?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.399
Nice shot, dingus.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.985
Sorry.

12:14.985 --> 12:15.986
How about that power?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.070
What gives?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.448
You kicking orbs at us
'cause we're Newts fans?

12:19.448 --> 12:22.034
We're not to blame
for your team's inferior performance.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.285
It was an accident.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.369
We're sorry.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.289
- You should be.
- Newts are a great creature,

12:27.289 --> 12:30.000
but the footorb squad
is a bunch of deceivers.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.628
You wouldn't have won that match
if it weren't for the blown call.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.046
Howlers fans,

12:34.046 --> 12:38.258
always so quick to blame everything
but the skill of their players.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.343
That's funny.

12:39.343 --> 12:43.555
We hear everything involving the Newts
is suboptimal, including the fans.

12:44.056 --> 12:47.809
- What are you doing?
- Look, excessive fandom is ridiculous.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.561
We don't even know each other,

12:49.561 --> 12:53.815
yet you choose to make unfounded judgments
based on artificial allegiances.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.400
My allegiance is real.

12:55.400 --> 13:00.072
I like the Newts logo and the colors
and the way the players celebrate: classy.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.490
Well, why don't we spice things up

13:01.490 --> 13:03.867
and settle our differences
with something we can control?

13:03.867 --> 13:04.952
A pick-up game.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.120
See which team
actually has the better fans.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.914
You're on.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.459
Hey, look,
I apologize for being a jerk sometimes,

13:12.459 --> 13:14.503
but this is taking things way too far.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.588
No, this is good. Let's play some footorb.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.006
I'm getting it. The drama.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.468
The primal feeling of competing
and achieving great physical feats.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.763
We can be like real howlers,
strategizing and working together.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.933
- This is genuine, huh?
- Yeah.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.644
I know all you get for winning
is the pride of knowing you're superior

13:30.644 --> 13:33.355
at a made-up inconsequential game,
but it is fun to play.

13:33.355 --> 13:37.693
Okay, a little condescending,
but you're starting to speak my language.

13:37.693 --> 13:38.986
Let's do this.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.279
First to three goals.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.363
What do you say?

13:41.363 --> 13:44.449
You Howlers wanna lose to us
just like your team did last night?

13:45.742 --> 13:46.743
We're in.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.662
Not for the losing part though.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.831
I made the wrong call at work

13:50.831 --> 13:53.542
and the fans reacted with a hurtful chant.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.879
Beings can certainly be overly passionate
about their footorb teams.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.131
I doubt their intention
was to make you feel bad.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.800
They were most likely expressing
perceived injustice.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.385
We should explore your pain further.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.678
Can you talk more about that?

14:04.678 --> 14:06.597
I think I felt scared

14:06.597 --> 14:10.017
and that their voices
were not dissimilar to my own.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.270
It was like they were articulating
my own inner insecurities.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.314
That I have bad judgment.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.316
That I'm regularly wrong.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.443
Now my bosses are making me take a test

14:19.443 --> 14:22.070
that determines the future
of my employment.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.906
I'm not entirely confident about it.

14:23.906 --> 14:27.075
It is not uncommon for beings
to question their adequacy.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.285
No being is perfect.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.494
We all make mistakes.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.122
Isn't that part of the appeal
of orb games?

14:32.122 --> 14:34.666
It is important to remember
that you worked hard

14:34.666 --> 14:37.211
to achieve employment
as a professional referee,

14:37.211 --> 14:40.422
and that you would not have been hired
if you were not qualified.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.507
I guess.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.842
Well, what made you want to be a referee?

14:44.468 --> 14:49.598
Well, yes, I do love that footorb
is unscripted and unpredictable.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.601
That beings are performing
miraculous physical feats

14:52.601 --> 14:54.394
live right before your eyes.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.813
You know,
from the time I was a young being,

14:56.813 --> 14:59.733
I knew I wanted to be a part of
professional footorb.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.110
I watched the matches
with my super-lifegiver.

15:02.110 --> 15:07.074
I remember being enamored
with the beings with whistles and watches,

15:07.074 --> 15:09.910
making sure both teams played fairly.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.288
The impartial keepers of the rules
and the peace.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.624
They were just as physically capable
as the players

15:15.624 --> 15:19.670
and ensured balanced orchestration
on both sides of the orb.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.507
Isn't it amazing
that you realized your dream?

15:23.507 --> 15:25.050
It wasn't easy.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.178
In times of self-doubt,
remind yourself of your achievement.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.430
I believe you can do this.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.515
Thank you.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.016
I think I'm ready.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.024
- Goal!
- Goal!

15:41.984 --> 15:43.485
What was that?

15:43.485 --> 15:45.112
You should have been defending.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.781
Well, you should have been offending.

15:48.407 --> 15:49.533
Okay, you know what?

15:49.533 --> 15:50.784
Let's work together.

15:50.784 --> 15:51.869
I'll shoot the goal.

15:51.869 --> 15:55.372
So you take the orb out to start,
I'll get open, and you pass it to me.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.249
Pass it to me!

15:57.249 --> 15:58.584
I have a shot!

16:01.753 --> 16:04.339
- Goal!
- Goal, baby! Yeah!

16:04.339 --> 16:07.092
I don't understand
why you got us into this mess.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.761
You never listen,
and you always diminish my interests.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.805
Apologies.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.182
I thought I had that shot.

16:13.182 --> 16:15.767
We playing,
or are you both gonna yap all night?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.186
Yeah, this is boring

16:17.186 --> 16:20.189
and not worth the freeze lick
I was promised to keep score.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.648
We'll add in hot fudge.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.733
We're about to win.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.073
We trust you!

16:30.073 --> 16:31.158
Go get 'em, champ!

16:31.825 --> 16:33.660
Welcome, fellow referees.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.121
Today we will be testing your abilities.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.040
We've set up a unique proving ground

16:38.040 --> 16:41.418
upon which your recertification
will stand or fail.

16:41.418 --> 16:45.797
You have to exemplify your skill
in making calls under immense pressure

16:45.797 --> 16:48.133
while experiencing extreme distraction.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.512
Each of you will take a run at our
state-of-the-art obstacle course.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.972
Before we get started,
may I ask a question?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.350
This is unorthodox, but I'll allow it.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.478
Okay,
has anyone ever thought about the irony

16:59.478 --> 17:03.148
that the job of a referee
is to call players on infractions,

17:03.148 --> 17:06.359
but referees themselves
are not allowed to make infractions?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.319
- So deep.
- My mind just exploded.

17:09.029 --> 17:09.863
Settle down.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.741
For your disruption,
you will be testing first.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.911
I'm going to ace this test,
despite not knowing what I have to do.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.246
Gotta love that confidence.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.413
Step on up.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.749
Let's do this.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.252
On my whistle,
you will run through the course,

17:23.252 --> 17:26.880
showcasing your physical prowess,
while making appropriate calls

17:26.880 --> 17:29.341
based on the infractions
you see simulated.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.849
For each missed physical challenge
or missed call,

17:36.849 --> 17:38.392
we will be removing a stripe.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.561
If you lose two stripes, you fail.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.604
Remember, be ready for anything.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.319
Correct!

17:53.240 --> 17:55.200
Nope, that's a red card.

18:01.832 --> 18:02.833
Yikes.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.627
You never wanna see that.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.879
Who's next?

18:06.879 --> 18:09.047
- Don't pick me. Not me. You can't see me.
- Please, not me.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.133
You, the visibly distraught one.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.010
- Me?
- Not me.

18:13.010 --> 18:15.762
You with the
crushing anxiety, you're up!

18:18.974 --> 18:20.017
We believe in you!

18:20.017 --> 18:21.518
Watch out for birds.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.229
You got this.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.522
Ready!

18:30.068 --> 18:31.445
Nice!

18:34.823 --> 18:35.908
Correct!

18:41.580 --> 18:42.706
Interference!

18:45.000 --> 18:47.711
If you are not able to continue,
you will fail.

18:48.378 --> 18:51.048
You've been certified once,
you can do it again.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.634
You love footorb.

18:53.634 --> 18:54.843
You got this!

19:00.849 --> 19:01.850
Correct!

19:04.686 --> 19:05.521
Correct!

19:10.609 --> 19:11.860
Nice dodge!

19:13.654 --> 19:15.155
The final challenge.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.079
Come on!

19:25.582 --> 19:26.917
Egregious.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.007
Correct!

19:36.426 --> 19:38.554
Yeah! We knew you could do it!

19:38.554 --> 19:40.347
That's deception. We were really worried.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.058
Congratulations!
You showed real guts out there.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.310
It was a joy to see you
overcome the course.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.354
You are now recertified.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.438
Thank you.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.440
I can't wait to get back on the field.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.986
Okay, well, things are not looking good.

19:53.986 --> 19:56.405
We're down by two,
and you need to get it together.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.949
Two points is nothing.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.367
They're not points.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.578
And two is a big number in footorb.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.872
Look, this was a mistake.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.999
I tried to show you something
I care deeply about,

20:06.999 --> 20:08.417
and you didn't listen at all.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.711
My interest was supposed to
bring us together.

20:10.711 --> 20:11.795
Your interest?

20:11.795 --> 20:15.549
I showed you the magic of the forest,
and it's like you forgot all about it.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.301
Why can't you just listen to me?

20:19.845 --> 20:22.097
We really do make a terrible team, huh?

20:23.265 --> 20:24.808
Truly awful.

20:25.976 --> 20:30.814
I guess we'll just be like this forever,
and Lifegiver really will perish unhappy.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.319
No, we can win this.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.779
If not for each other, then for Lifegiver.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.073
For Lifegiver.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.327
We'll play just like the whitetails.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.913
You were listening.

20:45.913 --> 20:47.164
You know what to do.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.377
- You give up?
- No, we're just getting warmed up.

20:57.132 --> 20:57.966
Hey!

21:00.636 --> 21:01.720
- Yeah!
- Yes!

21:02.971 --> 21:04.223
It's working!

21:04.223 --> 21:05.599
Whitetails.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.730
Whitetail!

21:12.856 --> 21:13.899
What is happening?

21:15.567 --> 21:16.693
We're doing it!

21:16.693 --> 21:18.612
Yes! For Lifegiver!

21:18.612 --> 21:19.696
For each other.

21:21.031 --> 21:23.367
All right, no more playing around--

21:23.367 --> 21:24.701
- What?
- Hey. What?

21:32.626 --> 21:34.711
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

21:36.296 --> 21:38.298
Whitetails for the win!

21:39.049 --> 21:41.260
I did not think we'd pull that off.

21:41.844 --> 21:43.554
All right. Good game.

21:43.554 --> 21:44.847
You played well.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.932
The Howlers
are still a terrible team though.

21:48.141 --> 21:48.976
Yeah!

21:56.775 --> 21:58.318
You all saw that infraction, right?

21:58.318 --> 21:59.820
Red card, clear as day.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.697
It is so good to have you back.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.074
<i>Great call!</i>

22:04.074 --> 22:06.034
Good judgment! Good judgment!

22:07.035 --> 22:09.329
<i>It looks like the ref is back on top!</i>

22:10.789 --> 22:11.915
Good judgment!

22:14.626 --> 22:15.586
You're here early.

22:15.586 --> 22:18.172
Didn't want to miss the start of the game.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.340
Get in here.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.592
Good to see ya, sib.

22:21.592 --> 22:23.510
The Howlers are playing the Buzz Stingers.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.763
I read some buzz stingers perish
after only one use of their stinger.

22:26.763 --> 22:30.392
Strange they would name their team
after such a fragile creature.

22:30.392 --> 22:35.647
It brings joy to my blood pump
to see my offspring getting along.

22:35.647 --> 22:39.151
Thank you for listening
to your old lifegiver.

22:39.151 --> 22:41.737
Now I can perish happy.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.323
Lifegiver.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.617
Lifegiver?

22:46.617 --> 22:47.701
Not yet.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.203
Relax. I just need a nap.
