It's alive!

00:39.005 --> 00:41.803
Hey, I'm "Robot Chicken"
executive producer Seth Green.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.675
I'm here to introduce the winner
of last year's PS3 contest,

00:45.745 --> 00:46.769
James Duffy.

00:47.914 --> 00:50.644
Take a bow, James.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.547
Aah!

00:51.618 --> 00:52.778
Yeah, you like that?

00:52.852 --> 00:54.217
You fucking like that?!

00:54.287 --> 00:55.686
Yeah, you do.
You're a winner!

00:55.755 --> 00:57.154
You're so lucky!

00:57.223 --> 00:58.850
Such a lucky winner!

00:58.925 --> 00:59.949
So lucky!

01:00.026 --> 01:01.186
Shh. It's okay.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.957
It's almost over.
It's almost over.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.725
So lucky.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.432
Here's your PS3!

01:09.502 --> 01:12.733
Keep watching for
our next big contest.

01:20.246 --> 01:23.181
What the fuck is going
on here?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.098
Ooh!

01:56.049 --> 01:57.516
Meow! Meow!

02:09.496 --> 02:11.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.664
Check this.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.234
Oh, my god!

02:20.173 --> 02:21.231
Ah, darn!

02:21.307 --> 02:22.865
He's... he's dead!

02:22.942 --> 02:23.909
Want to play again?

02:23.977 --> 02:24.944
You killed him!

02:25.011 --> 02:26.535
What are you talking about,
Becky?

02:26.613 --> 02:27.910
You said you would help him.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.347
But he's dead!

02:30.416 --> 02:31.383
Hello.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.782
Yes, I would like to report a
murder.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.217
Becky, what are you doing?

02:34.287 --> 02:35.413
It was an accident, Becky.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.477
You were there!

02:36.556 --> 02:37.955
The police are on their way,
Mikey.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.015
I promise I will do everything I
can for you.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.219
No! No! No! No! No! No!

02:41.294 --> 02:42.852
This can't be happening, man!

02:42.929 --> 02:44.954
This can't be happening!

02:45.031 --> 02:46.191
Come on! No!

02:46.266 --> 02:47.893
Fight! Fight!

02:47.967 --> 02:48.797
Come on!

02:48.868 --> 02:49.926
It's over, Mikey.

02:50.003 --> 02:50.833
Get off me!

02:50.904 --> 02:52.132
No! No, no, no!

02:52.205 --> 02:53.797
I can't go to prison!

02:53.873 --> 02:55.397
I wouldn't last a day!

02:57.243 --> 02:58.972
I'm sorry, Becky.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.673
Mikey, no!

03:01.748 --> 03:04.581
Damn you, Milton Bradley!

03:05.919 --> 03:10.549
Foul Beasts, I, Spawn,
the superhero from hell,

03:10.623 --> 03:12.853
will defeat you!

03:14.894 --> 03:15.952
Never!

03:16.029 --> 03:18.054
The world of man will be crushed

03:18.131 --> 03:20.565
under the march of my hellish
army!

03:20.633 --> 03:21.793
Aah!

03:21.868 --> 03:24.803
Let the challenge begin!

03:33.146 --> 03:36.707
All: # Big in the '90s, Spawn, Spawn, Spawn #

03:36.783 --> 03:40.583
# Created by a guy named
McFarlane #

03:40.653 --> 03:43.986
# Had his own show on HBO #

03:44.057 --> 03:45.285
# Did the plot make sense? #

03:45.358 --> 03:47.519
# No, no, no #

04:01.808 --> 04:03.207
Maleboglia wins!

04:03.276 --> 04:05.608
Yeah, Maleboglia totally
wins!

04:05.678 --> 04:07.339
What?!

04:07.413 --> 04:12.043
Ohh, when do we get a bathroom
break?

04:12.952 --> 04:13.816
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

04:16.089 --> 04:18.454
Check me out!

04:19.625 --> 04:21.389
Check me out!

04:21.461 --> 04:23.827
Yeah!

04:25.298 --> 04:26.492
Aah, you're in public!

04:26.566 --> 04:28.500
Have some self-respect,
for god's sake!

04:28.568 --> 04:30.866
I can't believe you'd do
something like that!

04:30.937 --> 04:32.598
What's wrong with you?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.971
You ate that chick
three weeks ago.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.011
How long are you gonna keep
dressing like that?

04:39.078 --> 04:41.444
As long as it makes me happy!

04:42.448 --> 04:47.215
This fall, a hot new comedy
from NBS...

04:47.287 --> 04:49.187
We're gonna kill you, Christ!

04:50.223 --> 04:51.520
Oh, you.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.116
Fun and foibles taken from
the real-life experiences

04:54.193 --> 04:56.423
of series creator Jesus Christ.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.260
I hope this hurts you, scum!

05:00.767 --> 05:02.860
Sundays at 9:00 A.M.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.537
Arthur Fonzarelli was doing
his best,

05:06.606 --> 05:08.540
but his best wasn't enough.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.337
I need the rent money, Fonz,

05:10.410 --> 05:12.401
or I need you out in the
morning.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.308
Whoa!

05:13.379 --> 05:14.710
Brokerino!

05:16.816 --> 05:18.647
I need you to trust me.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.980
I trust you.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.816
Are you gonna rape me?

05:21.888 --> 05:22.912
Whoa!

05:22.989 --> 05:24.286
Sit on it!

05:24.357 --> 05:26.348
<i>Are you gonna make
me sit on it?</i>

05:26.426 --> 05:28.553
Do you have any work
experience?

05:28.628 --> 05:30.687
No, but I can do this.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.558
Uh... are you a pimp?

05:34.634 --> 05:36.898
So, you can repair jukeboxes?

05:36.969 --> 05:37.867
Well, no.

05:37.937 --> 05:40.098
See, if it's turned off but
plugged in,

05:40.173 --> 05:43.700
then I can turn it
on by hitting it with my fist.

05:43.776 --> 05:47.075
Why don't you just turn it on
with the switch?

05:47.146 --> 05:48.545
Whoa!

05:48.614 --> 05:50.104
Did mom leave because of me?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.947
Look, Chach, I don't even
really know who your mom is.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.045
But by leaving you,
she was wr-wr-wr...

05:57.023 --> 05:58.615
She was wr-wr-wr-wr...

05:58.691 --> 06:00.158
She was wr-wr-wr...

06:00.226 --> 06:01.318
She was a bitch!

06:01.394 --> 06:03.021
But against all odds...

06:03.096 --> 06:06.190
I got customers who need to
use the bathroom!

06:06.265 --> 06:07.755
Al, this is my office.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.065
Well, some people need to
take a shit in your desk,

06:11.137 --> 06:12.365
so open the door.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.567
Don't you ever let anyone

06:15.641 --> 06:18.838
tell you that you can't do
something, okay?

06:18.911 --> 06:20.310
...He rose above it all.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.211
You want something,
you do it.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.339
Period!

06:26.085 --> 06:30.818
Arthur Fonzarelli in...
"The Pursuit of Happy Days. "

06:30.890 --> 06:32.152
And coming at you now is

06:32.225 --> 06:35.388
"Get 'Em, They're Different"
by the Nazis!

06:35.461 --> 06:39.227
# I will ass-rape you with
a pitchfork #

06:39.298 --> 06:42.267
Dude, working for the
Mandarin sure is sweet!

06:42.335 --> 06:44.895
Well, I tell chicks I work
for Dr. Doom.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.199
How are they gonna know?

06:47.807 --> 06:50.367
Oh, great, here comes Iron Man!

06:50.443 --> 06:51.273
What do you think?

06:51.344 --> 06:52.641
Should we sound the alarm here?

06:52.712 --> 06:54.009
Ah, he's still a ways off.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.340
Oh, man, did you see the game
last night?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.884
Oh, yeah fucking Knicks!

07:00.486 --> 07:02.852
I tell you, this headquarters
was a great buy.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.686
Yeah, all we had to do was
pull up the berber carpeting,

07:05.758 --> 07:08.318
and we can hear Iron Man coming
a mile away!

07:11.030 --> 07:11.860
Whoa!

07:11.931 --> 07:13.159
What the hell?!

07:13.232 --> 07:15.029
Oh, he's in the air duct!

07:15.101 --> 07:16.466
That's a new one!

07:16.536 --> 07:18.561
Should we tell the Mandarin?!

07:18.638 --> 07:19.662
What?!

07:19.739 --> 07:22.207
I said, should we tell the
Mandarin?!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.469
Who's Darren?!

07:23.543 --> 07:24.567
Both:
Aah!

07:24.644 --> 07:25.770
Oh, my god!

07:25.845 --> 07:27.904
You're on top of my spine!

07:27.980 --> 07:29.572
Get off of me!

07:29.649 --> 07:32.140
God, please, get off!

07:32.218 --> 07:33.150
I can't!

07:33.219 --> 07:34.379
I can't get up!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.046
You're crushing us!

07:36.122 --> 07:38.886
Hang on,
I'll use my rocket boots.

07:38.958 --> 07:39.925
Both:
No!

07:39.992 --> 07:41.823
Aah!

07:50.803 --> 07:51.633
Oh.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.535
Hey.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.436
What's up?

07:54.507 --> 07:55.439
You've been here four hour!

07:55.508 --> 07:57.066
You go now!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.873
Now back to VH1's top 100
final episodes ever,

07:59.946 --> 08:01.345
the latest in our line of

08:01.414 --> 08:05.180
"top 100 something-something
whatever" crap programming.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.982
"The Facts of Life" weren't all
about Natalie's stretch marks

08:09.055 --> 08:11.023
or Joe's extraneous sex organ.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.887
Some facts were harsh indeed.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.655
Oh, girls,
don't look so down.

08:15.728 --> 08:16.990
This chapter is over,

08:17.063 --> 08:20.089
but a new chapter is right
around the corner.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.430
Will it be a chapter filled
with raw cookie dough?

08:23.636 --> 08:25.627
To new beginnings!

08:27.006 --> 08:28.769
I-I feel gross.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.002
Why, did you look in a
mirror?

08:31.077 --> 08:32.101
I feel dizzy.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.613
Yes, my lovelies,
nothing will tear us apart.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.710
Yes, we'll be together forever.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.050
Aah!

08:51.397 --> 08:54.230
Remember Eddie Murphy's Fox
show, "The PJs"?

08:54.300 --> 08:55.130
Me neither!

08:56.235 --> 08:57.600
What on Eartha Kitt?

08:57.670 --> 08:59.763
Whitney Houston,
we have a problem.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.672
If they ask, you's my sister.
You mean, "brother."

09:02.742 --> 09:04.369
What? You ain't got no urkel.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.740
Doh!

09:05.811 --> 09:07.438
Vivica A. Fuck.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.472
When "Mork and Mindy" ended
after four seasons,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.018
the shazbot really hit the fan.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.144
You did the right thing,
Miss McConnell.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.119
Oh, na-nu na-nu.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.253
Oh, they're cutting into me.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.382
That's not a... oh,
I'm gonna need those!

09:19.458 --> 09:20.982
Don't take those!

09:21.060 --> 09:24.052
Hey, hey, you're takin'...
ar, ar, ar, down, Mr. Happy.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.291
Oh!

09:30.636 --> 09:33.298
"The Incredible Hulk"
was a ratings behemoth,

09:33.372 --> 09:35.169
but eventually David Banner
walked off into

09:35.241 --> 09:37.675
the sunset for the final time.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.974
On a related note, Bill Bixby
walked off into the sunset

09:41.047 --> 09:43.413
for the final time on
November 21, 1993.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.473
His bat was cancer.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.282
For 10 seasons,
"The Love Boat" stank.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.848
In the final episode,
"The Love Boat" sank.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.258
Will you go down with the
ship, Captain?

09:56.329 --> 10:00.789
That water looks cold,
Gopher... far, far too cold.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.834
See you in hell fucko!

10:05.137 --> 10:06.365
Help me!

10:06.439 --> 10:11.172
Oh, for the love of god,
help me!

10:11.243 --> 10:13.302
Aah!

10:14.046 --> 10:15.206
Oh, this is looking bad.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.511
Aah!
Oh, no!

10:20.219 --> 10:23.985
Coming up on VH1's
"Top 100 final episodes ever"...

10:24.056 --> 10:25.683
It wasn't a chicken!

10:25.758 --> 10:27.851
It was a baby!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.961
