03:23.070 --> 03:25.904
It's common knowledge that
when we've forgotten something,

03:25.906 --> 03:27.372
it may be because we've failed

03:27.374 --> 03:29.575
to encode it very effectively.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.109
Because we were distracted while

03:31.111 --> 03:33.312
the encoding should
have taken place

03:33.314 --> 03:36.181
or because we're having trouble
retrieving that information.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.517
However, there are
elements of the self

03:38.519 --> 03:40.452
that are too important
and functional

03:40.454 --> 03:44.723
to fall under simple encoding,
retaining, and retrieving.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.926
As I explained, the self isn't
stored in just one place.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.096
It's located in various
different areas of the brain.

03:51.098 --> 03:54.032
And at the same time,
in the nowhere land.

03:54.034 --> 03:57.336
A magnetic imprint that is
stored as an energy network.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.037
The research I
submitted shows that if

03:59.039 --> 04:01.940
we can understand the mechanism
of this magnetic imprint,

04:01.942 --> 04:04.376
it will be easier to
access it even when

04:04.378 --> 04:05.911
the brain cells
have become damaged,

04:05.913 --> 04:08.180
by for example, Alzheimer's.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.915
In this way it'll
be possible to limit

04:09.917 --> 04:12.017
the amount of information
loss in those patients.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.619
Is there any physical evidence

04:13.621 --> 04:15.721
that those magnetic
fields exist?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.289
Oh, yes.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.957
We measured the oscillations
on the magnetic field

04:18.959 --> 04:21.026
around the brain for
long periods of time

04:21.028 --> 04:23.295
and the results showed a
distinct pattern change

04:23.297 --> 04:24.563
as the subjects aged.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.964
Aged?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.466
How many years are
we talking about?

04:27.468 --> 04:29.501
We couldn't do the
test with human beings,

04:29.503 --> 04:30.869
it would've taken
a lifetime just

04:30.871 --> 04:33.038
to measure the
maturity of the self.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.840
We used mice and
other small animals

04:34.842 --> 04:36.508
with a shorter lifespan.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.778
The next phase will involve
using this knowledge in humans

04:39.780 --> 04:41.380
and seeing what the
limitations are to

04:41.382 --> 04:43.749
the hypothesis and how
to work around them.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.885
Can we claim a patent
on those magnetic fields?

04:46.887 --> 04:50.455
I don't know if we can put a
patent on the magnetic field,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.557
but I can tell you this.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.927
An individualized therapy, if
effective, will cost money.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.462
It will involve an
approach that uses

04:57.464 --> 04:59.498
both drugs and hardware.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.966
Maybe even implanted
in the brain

05:00.968 --> 05:03.435
like a pacemaker,
only much smaller.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.537
And these can be patented.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.572
Imagine if it allows
us to communicate

05:07.574 --> 05:09.675
with comatose patients or cut

05:09.677 --> 05:12.544
in half rehabilitation
or physiotherapy time

05:12.546 --> 05:17.449
by acting directly upon the
inner brain, the deepest self.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.319
If effective, public
pressure for the adoption

05:20.321 --> 05:23.522
of these new therapies will
create a market in itself.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.123
What we are doing is opening up

05:25.125 --> 05:26.692
a whole new branch of medicine.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.560
And we will own it.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.330
Thank you, Doctor Stevens.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.765
It seems there are no
more questions left.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.034
We will get in touch
with you very soon.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.036
Thank you.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.178
Hi, thanks for coming.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.280
I'm so sorry we had to
change the lunch plans.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.382
Oh, that's perfectly all right.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.917
We've just got to talk about
your schedule for next week.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.218
Yeah.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.087
Um, mother, she
wants to talk to you.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.893
Hello, sweetie.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.265
I'll leave you two alone.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.267
I'll be back later.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.504
Moira, what's going on?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.106
Why did Rachel have to leave us?

06:15.642 --> 06:17.576
I must thank you
for giving Rachel

06:17.578 --> 06:19.277
a job as your assistant.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.179
It means so much to her.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.683
She was an excellent student.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.718
She really deserved it.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.153
You know I'd never
given that position

06:28.155 --> 06:29.888
to anyone who hadn't
proved herself.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.823
I wanted to thank you anyway.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.961
But that wasn't the reason that

06:35.963 --> 06:37.562
I asked Rachel to
bring you here.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.737
The treatment isn't
working anymore

06:45.739 --> 06:49.107
and I've reached the
end of my options.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.411
I've decided to stop taking
those dreadful drugs.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.348
I've been giving
things a lot of thought

06:57.584 --> 06:59.951
and I've decided
it's time to die.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.086
But so soon?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.126
I've had enough
time to say goodbye

07:08.128 --> 07:11.129
to all my friends and
put my things in order.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.768
I've got what I wanted.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.442
Of course I realize the
sadness my passing will cause,

07:24.378 --> 07:25.944
especially to Rachel.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.782
But Rachel doesn't
need me here alive,

07:30.784 --> 07:34.119
there is no death,
I'll always be here.

07:36.256 --> 07:40.025
I want you to be the last
person I say goodbye to.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.727
I want you to be
with me when I pass.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.531
It will be good to have
a close friend by my side

07:46.533 --> 07:48.767
and I know it'll give
some peace to Rachel.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.972
Of course I will, my dear.

07:56.276 --> 08:01.146
And Helen, I have a request
that I want you to consider.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.816
You were my brightest student,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.285
and the most gifted
medium I've ever known.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.857
Now that I'm about to leave,

08:11.859 --> 08:14.526
I want you to consider
continuing my work.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.663
I couldn't.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.465
I can't.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.800
Not after Lilly's death.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.970
I lost everything.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.973
But your gift wasn't
lost, it's still there.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.175
Even after all these years.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.177
It's no use.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.346
I've given that up.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.015
I don't do that anymore,
I'm not that person anymore.

08:38.251 --> 08:42.254
One cannot choose to
renounce one's gift.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.222
A medium with your power,

08:45.459 --> 08:48.159
it's hard to believe
you haven't made contact

08:48.161 --> 08:50.562
with the other side
in all these years.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.334
Was it because you
couldn't contact Lilly?

08:56.336 --> 08:59.237
You know she can't be
contacted where she is.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.107
It's beyond your gift.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.176
I really can't.

09:08.282 --> 09:12.117
I know you have your
research, it's a noble ambition,

09:16.023 --> 09:19.524
but if you want to touch
memories inside the soul

09:19.526 --> 09:21.159
you'll have to go back.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.130
Sooner or later every medium has

09:25.132 --> 09:26.932
to go back to the other side.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.734
You know you will.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.310
Now, I want you all to
take Dr. Planchard's paper

09:38.312 --> 09:39.644
and study it over the weekend

09:39.646 --> 09:41.179
because next week we're
gonna be discussing

09:41.181 --> 09:44.082
the treatment to the latest
stages of Alzheimer's.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.417
Yes?

09:45.419 --> 09:46.651
Should we include
Dr. Planchard's study

09:46.653 --> 09:48.954
about cholinesterase inhibitors?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.255
Yes.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.490
In a nutshell, Dr.
Planchard discusses two

09:52.492 --> 09:54.326
of the three
cholinesterase inhibitors.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.461
Rivastigmine and Donepezil.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.129
For the third, Galantamine,

09:58.131 --> 10:00.265
you'll have to read the
other paper I gave you.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.267
Mine.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.069
For people with
severe Alzheimer's

10:04.071 --> 10:05.937
and for people with
moderate Alzheimer's,

10:05.939 --> 10:08.340
when cholinesterase
inhibitors don't work

10:08.342 --> 10:10.675
or aren't suitable,
the only therapy.

10:10.677 --> 10:14.045
The patient in this case is
an 84-year-old woman in Canada

10:14.047 --> 10:17.082
who will respond yes and
no to simple questions

10:17.084 --> 10:18.917
while already in
the terminal phase.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.754
All her memories were gone and
she wasn't able to elaborate

10:22.756 --> 10:25.423
but she was still able to answer
84% of the questions asked.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.326
I don't like to use
the term soul, Joanna.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.497
We're doctors, not priests.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.066
However, I will agree that
in a personal context,

10:35.068 --> 10:38.637
yes, we are trying to talk
directly to the living soul.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.874
But only as long as it's
inside a living patient.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.943
And that makes a
world of difference.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.968
Trust me, I've been
doing this for years.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.370
That was a brilliant
presentation.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.372
Now you're worth seven million.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.874
How does that feel?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.876
Feels like, um, seven million.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.581
Take the contract with you
and see if it's all in there.

11:27.154 --> 11:31.456
Now, there is something
that makes me feel uneasy.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.058
Mm hmm, what?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.727
You know how important
this money is for us.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.535
Have you got a pen?

11:45.572 --> 11:47.439
You don't want to go over it?

11:47.441 --> 11:49.574
At least read it?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.342
John, I trust you.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.778
I hope you trust me, too.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.498
Oh, oh.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.843
How is she?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.144
- She's not good.
- Oh.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.251
I don't have any
strength left in me, I.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.122
I know, but you're
not alone in this, okay?

12:38.825 --> 12:40.558
You know, no
matter what they say,

12:41.661 --> 12:44.262
nothing prepares you for this.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.330
It's so hard.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.268
Anyway.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.771
She wanted you to be
here, so maybe she

12:52.773 --> 12:54.572
has something to
say to you and um,

12:56.710 --> 12:58.943
yeah, I just don't know
what to think anymore.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.946
Let me take it from here, okay?

13:03.950 --> 13:04.950
Okay.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.255
Go ahead.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.709
Moira, can you hear me?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.746
Rachel's outside.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.981
She loves you very much.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.884
She'll be fine.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.855
I'll make sure she is.

13:43.857 --> 13:47.492
It's almost over,
that's why I'm here.

13:48.762 --> 13:53.431
To help you cross
safely and gently.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.411
I'm ready, my friend.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.949
You can go now, darling.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.953
I promise I'll take
good care of Rachel.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.558
I can see you more clearly now.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.597
Please, don't say a word.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.835
They'll be listening.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.571
Your gift as a
medium can only rival

14:33.573 --> 14:35.340
with your feelings as a mother.

14:36.743 --> 14:40.511
Your capacity for suffering
cannot be matched.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.914
But you are only
making things worse.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.650
Even though your
intentions are good,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.685
you are doomed to fail.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.655
Forgive me.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.557
Please forgive me.

14:54.127 --> 14:58.129
As things fade away, I can
see how powerful you are.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.500
But you have to do the
right thing, Helen,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.135
before it is too late.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.438
You have to let the pain go.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.007
It's beyond me.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.410
I can't change things.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.114
Please, forgive me.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.450
It is not up to
me to forgive you,

15:20.887 --> 15:25.857
but remember, in
time you will see

15:25.859 --> 15:29.327
that death is just a
way of coming back.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.066
She wanted you to have this.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.068
What's in it?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.202
I don't know.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.516
She wanted you to take
over after she died.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.617
You know that, right?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.875
What are these keys for?

16:17.877 --> 16:20.111
I dunno.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.724
Mom never told me
about this place.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.297
The documents say it was
bought over 40 years ago.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.932
The whole building looks empty.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.734
It's been empty for years.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.902
How do you know that?

16:44.904 --> 16:46.904
Your mom told me
vaguely once about a place

16:46.906 --> 16:48.906
she used when she
first started training.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.542
It was long before my time.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.645
She never told me why
she stopped using it.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.248
I didn't even know she owned it.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.352
Why would she keep
it all these years?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.388
Can't you see she
did this for you?

17:04.324 --> 17:05.623
She wanted you to use it.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.228
I'm gonna call the university,

17:10.230 --> 17:11.628
I'm gonna tell them
you'll be late.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.636
Wait.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.973
I know you're still
training, but pay attention.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.810
There's an entity to your left.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.047
Can you see it?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.621
No.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.823
I'm still just a clairvoyant.

17:38.825 --> 17:39.924
I can't see them.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.934
This place is full of them.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.637
I can use this.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.441
Come on, let's go.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.921
Very good, you've found a place.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.125
I thought you were going
to use one of our labs.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.060
Oh, this'll work
better than any lab.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.062
It's perfect.

18:51.064 --> 18:54.365
Helen, we've already
discussed this issue.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.034
Regardless of the
results, this research

18:57.036 --> 19:00.271
must look scientific,
not paranormal.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.840
It will look and
it will be scientific

19:02.842 --> 19:05.076
as soon as I can
prove my theory.

19:05.078 --> 19:08.279
But to do that, I need to
use paranormal methods.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.981
It's too unorthodox.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.950
First you go to the lab
and work out your theories.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.720
I already have my theories,
thank you very much.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.055
I'm trying to reach the
living souls of patients

19:18.057 --> 19:20.324
whose brains are no
longer functioning.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.628
But before I run the tests on
real patients with real brains

19:23.630 --> 19:25.897
I must run the test on ghosts
who've been functioning

19:25.899 --> 19:27.565
for years without a brain.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.634
Oh, can't you see how far
we can advance after that

19:29.636 --> 19:31.969
when the time comes to
work on the real patients?

19:33.039 --> 19:34.172
No.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.706
Yes.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.942
Let me do my tests on ghosts.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.881
What's the place?

19:43.883 --> 19:44.882
It's an apartment.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.250
It's amazing.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.818
The address is in the report.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.688
It's bursting with communication
and the best thing is,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.823
it's shielded from
most radio signals.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.159
You know you have to produce

19:55.161 --> 19:57.628
some actual results, don't you?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.931
That means leaving
your ghosts out of it.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.566
Yes, but before I get to that,

20:01.568 --> 20:04.335
I must start the
tests I asked you for.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.470
Have you got them?

20:06.472 --> 20:07.939
Yes, use these.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.842
I created them myself.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.579
But what if they don't work?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.114
I designed them for the
living, not for the dead.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.317
Oh, they'll work, I assure you.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.519
In the meantime we
have an agreement.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.688
I provide you with
the funds you need,

20:23.690 --> 20:25.189
you let me work my way.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.327
You think I only
care about the money.

20:30.763 --> 20:34.232
What if your tests don't work?

20:34.234 --> 20:36.567
Then I'll go back to the
lab and do it your way.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.042
This I do vow, and
this shall ever be,

21:19.279 --> 21:21.846
I will be true despite
thy side on thee.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.950
This I do vow, and
this shall ever be,

21:27.120 --> 21:29.420
I will be true despite
thy side on thee.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.364
Hello, my name is Helen.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.501
My name is Albert.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.039
I am sensing that
we have already met.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.741
Am I correct?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.476
You are correct.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.846
I was Moira's guide,
and it was her wish

21:55.848 --> 21:59.350
that I become your
guide after her passing.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.452
This place is shielded
from many radio

22:01.454 --> 22:03.888
and other electromagnetic
interferences.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.891
I'm sure you'll find the peace
you need within these walls.

22:08.361 --> 22:09.727
I come for help.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.932
I'd like to learn more about
what you retained from life.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.868
I brought a few tests I'd like

22:17.870 --> 22:19.670
to run on you if you don't mind.

22:21.841 --> 22:22.890
Not at all.

22:22.891 --> 22:23.940
But you will have to
bring such notches

22:23.943 --> 22:25.876
into this table in order for you

22:25.878 --> 22:27.878
to better understand this.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.181
You see, we have
developed a new form

22:30.183 --> 22:33.217
of communication to
solve some issues.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.886
Some of them are
highly experimental,

22:35.888 --> 22:37.421
and some of them very risky.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.125
I understand.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.083
Albert?

25:19.952 --> 25:22.086
Hello, Helen.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.289
We appreciate that you
brought what we asked.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.657
I brought different kinds,

25:26.659 --> 25:28.759
I don't know what you
plan to do with them.

25:28.761 --> 25:32.062
What we're about to do is
a technique we have advanced.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.932
We think it is about time
to show it to someone.

25:38.504 --> 25:41.071
Now, don't worry
about the camera,

25:41.073 --> 25:42.553
just focus on the
test you brought us.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.143
Yes.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.946
We're going to do an exercise
with all of you, I hope.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.849
It's an exercise
designed to test

25:51.851 --> 25:54.451
your mathematical capabilities.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.153
It will show how far you can go

25:56.155 --> 25:58.222
with progressively
difficult tasks.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.458
You first.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.094
Please try to count
backwards from a hundred.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.331
100, 99, 98, 97...

26:09.302 --> 26:10.302
Stop.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.704
Now let's go back to a hundred.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.975
Now let's do it again,
but this time in sevens.

26:19.111 --> 26:24.114
100, 93, 86, 79.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.111
Can you do the same he did?

26:27.320 --> 26:30.721
But this time, instead of
counting backwards in sevens,

26:30.723 --> 26:31.889
count in sixes.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.124
- 100.
- 100.

26:39.966 --> 26:40.966
You now.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.133
Let's make it harder.

26:44.337 --> 26:45.569
Let's try in 13s.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.539
- 100.
- 100.

26:48.541 --> 26:49.873
- 87.
- 87.

26:49.875 --> 26:50.875
- 74.
- 74.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.103
Who knows, we may even win

27:53.105 --> 27:55.039
a Nobel Prize 20 years from now.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.142
Take a good look
at those photos.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.347
One of the entities
asked me to place

28:03.349 --> 28:04.848
a loaded camera on the table.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.652
It took these pictures
all by itself in the dark.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.487
I loaded the camera
myself with a brand new

28:10.489 --> 28:12.823
and roll of film I bought
only a few hours before.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.626
I also placed
several other rolls

28:15.628 --> 28:17.795
of film on the table, unused.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.302
It's poetry in Latin.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.339
I haven't seen all
the negatives yet,

28:29.341 --> 28:30.441
this is just a sample.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.577
Easy, Helen.

28:33.579 --> 28:37.047
You'll never be able to publish
half of what you're finding.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.849
Few people will
believe that you came

28:38.851 --> 28:41.885
to these conclusions
by speaking to ghosts.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.455
You can't even replicate
all of it in the lab,

28:44.457 --> 28:46.757
only in that apartment,
and only you can do it.

28:48.627 --> 28:49.793
You're a medium.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.763
Most scientists aren't.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.500
In two weeks this
apartment has given us

28:56.502 --> 28:59.503
enough material for at
least two years' research.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.238
That was Moira's gift to me.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.073
That's not the point!

29:03.075 --> 29:05.943
The point is we
have to pave the way

29:05.945 --> 29:09.546
for patents we'll claim
five years from now.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.649
You'll need to detail
the path really well,

29:12.651 --> 29:15.219
we can't have any mistakes here.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.888
And you are going to
spend the next 20 years

29:17.890 --> 29:19.757
locked in lab
trying to find a way

29:19.759 --> 29:23.193
to prove of this without
every citing a ghost.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.730
Don't be foolish, Helen,

29:28.033 --> 29:30.367
otherwise we won't
get a Nobel Prize.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.439
That's the game.

29:36.909 --> 29:41.445
Hmm, I can tell by your
silence that I'm right.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.716
You were lucky that
I believed in you

29:45.718 --> 29:48.085
even though I never saw a ghost.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.888
You can thank my
medium mother for that.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.323
But you knew the day would
come when you'd have all

29:53.325 --> 29:57.561
this data that you can't
prove or even discuss.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.762
Well perhaps you can tell people

29:58.764 --> 30:00.230
and they may believe you or not,

30:00.232 --> 30:04.334
but no one will sign a
20 million dollar check

30:05.437 --> 30:08.305
to fund a revolutionary
new treatment

30:08.307 --> 30:11.041
based on your
findings with ghosts.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.176
It's just not going to happen.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.077
What do you want me to do?

30:14.079 --> 30:16.680
I want you to keep your promise.

30:16.682 --> 30:19.917
Present some verifiable
data that will appease

30:19.919 --> 30:23.687
the investors but make sure
that it's scientifically sound.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.157
They gave us the money
to buy the equipment

30:27.159 --> 30:30.494
and hire the people, now you
have to feed them results

30:30.496 --> 30:32.095
so they keep the money flowing.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.965
If you can present the findings

30:34.967 --> 30:37.367
on that cassette in
a presentable manner,

30:37.369 --> 30:40.437
it'll be more than
enough for now.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.246
I need to find
a way to present all this

30:49.248 --> 30:50.914
in a way that won't
raise suspicions.

30:50.916 --> 30:51.849
I need time.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.116
You have very little.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.254
It's ironic that you
mentioned the Nobel Prize.

30:57.256 --> 31:00.290
That letter arrived yesterday
from Karolinska Institute.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.659
Swedes don't waste any time.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.927
They've heard about your grant

31:03.929 --> 31:05.562
and what you're
planning to find it.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.632
Seems that it's years ahead
of what they've been finding.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.334
Now they want to
know what we're doing

31:10.336 --> 31:11.702
and they want to join us.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.971
They even want to
share our costs.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.505
Isn't that amazing?

31:15.507 --> 31:17.808
Everybody wants to make
us rich and famous.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.478
But what am I
going to tell them?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.046
They're at the
forefront of the field

31:23.048 --> 31:25.883
and they have the
research to back it up.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.751
You have ghosts.

31:29.355 --> 31:32.055
You told them about mapping
the brain's magnetic fields.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.658
You told them about the
technology to act on it.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.127
That's what you have to find.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.529
And keep those
photos out of sight.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.265
They're fascinating, but
they aren't good enough

31:41.267 --> 31:42.366
for what you're doing.

31:45.838 --> 31:46.838
Excuse me?

31:48.440 --> 31:49.840
Dr. Stevens?

31:49.842 --> 31:51.642
I'm Helen Stevens, yes.

31:51.644 --> 31:52.910
How can I help you?

31:52.912 --> 31:54.878
I'm sorry if I
interrupted something.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.079
That's all right,
I'm just on my way out.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.714
What can I do for you?

31:57.716 --> 32:00.350
Well, I know some people,
they told me about you.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.618
Oh, sorry, I don't
have much time.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.287
Can you get straight
to the point?

32:03.289 --> 32:05.956
Well I've been looking for
someone who will understand.

32:05.958 --> 32:06.958
I need help.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.059
I don't know what to do.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.761
Who did this to you?

32:10.763 --> 32:12.896
Have you called the police?

32:12.898 --> 32:14.531
The police wouldn't believe me.

32:15.935 --> 32:16.935
I was told you would.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.741
An entity did this to you?

32:24.743 --> 32:27.077
It's happened many times before.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.079
Ever since I was a child.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.181
And it stopped without
any explanation.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.116
About six months ago
I started to feel

32:33.118 --> 32:35.452
its presence again
lurking around me.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.688
Then it started to break things.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.523
A few days ago it attacked me.

32:39.525 --> 32:40.958
Hasn't stopped since.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.359
Helen.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.360
Hey, I thought
you'd left by now.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.661
Oh, I'm just on my way.

32:44.663 --> 32:45.629
Uh, this is my
assistant, Rachel.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.030
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.365
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.733
Are you Elsa Lund?

32:49.735 --> 32:50.834
Yes.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.569
I'm such a huge fan!

32:52.571 --> 32:54.838
The Red Demon Series, I've
got them all, they're amazing!

32:54.840 --> 32:55.872
You know her?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.107
Yeah, you don't?

32:58.577 --> 33:01.311
Elsa is a graphic artist,
she's a demonic graphic artist.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.914
The pitchfork, the demon,
right, from the movie?

33:03.916 --> 33:05.015
It was her.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.216
You draw your visions.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.020
It's all right, Rachel
has the gift, too.

33:11.924 --> 33:14.424
I've never tried
to develop my gift,

33:14.426 --> 33:15.993
but I realize that
was a mistake.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.296
I need to know what
to do, I need help.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.265
I can refer you to some people
I know, they can train you.

33:22.267 --> 33:24.067
But I was told you were the best

33:24.069 --> 33:25.869
and money's not an issue.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.571
It's not a question of money.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.272
I haven't trained
anyone in years.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.542
Look, please, I don't think
I can survive another attack.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.097
We can help you.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.658
It looks like you
have two students now.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.532
Wow!

33:55.534 --> 33:56.933
Is this where you
design your creatures?

33:56.935 --> 33:57.935
Yeah.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.673
It may be a silly question,

34:03.675 --> 34:05.742
but why do you
create these things?

34:05.744 --> 34:08.978
I see these
entities all the time.

34:08.981 --> 34:11.181
They come in dreams and
often during the night.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.717
You see them?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.254
I really only see the one
that's been following me.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.989
All the others come in dreams
and feelings that I have.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.726
I, I, I can't hear
them, I can only see.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.431
Psychiatrist once told me to
draw them and talk to them.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.132
Psychiatrist, huh?

34:31.770 --> 34:34.804
So I started to draw them and
people started to like them.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.742
That's how I started my career.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.011
They say I give a very
accurate vision of hell.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.047
If only they knew.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.351
Elsa, come here.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.824
Close your eyes,
clear your mind.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.680
I see.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.785
There's somewhere
I'd like to take you.

35:30.829 --> 35:34.164
I'm afraid there aren't
many plates, place is empty.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.867
Well, I guess no place is ever
empty, you know what I mean.

35:36.869 --> 35:38.235
- Rachel.
- Yep?

35:38.237 --> 35:39.503
Think I saw some paper
napkins in the kitchen,

35:39.505 --> 35:40.785
- can you get them?
- Yeah, sure.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.306
You all right?

35:43.308 --> 35:44.574
I know this place.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.709
Have you been here before?

35:45.711 --> 35:47.377
Yes.

35:47.379 --> 35:50.013
No, it's a deja
vu, I don't know.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.150
Is it any connection with
the entity that hunts you?

35:53.152 --> 35:54.551
I can't say.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.419
Is it a haunting?

35:56.421 --> 35:57.821
Could it be a poltergeist?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.357
No, I said hunt, not haunt.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.526
Poltergeists never
get that personal.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.094
And this is personal.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.462
And it's hunting around you.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.831
Is there any way
of sending it away?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.733
No, but there's a way
of making you more robust.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.101
We can develop you further so

36:11.103 --> 36:13.503
you can better control
your sensitivity.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.172
You'll become of
less interest to it

36:15.174 --> 36:17.841
and gradually it'll
grow tired and go away.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.009
Sounds perfect.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.648
Helen, when did you
discover you were a medium?

36:27.152 --> 36:28.351
That's a long story.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.421
A very long story.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.658
You?

36:34.660 --> 36:35.725
I can't say.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.330
I've always seen those things.

36:40.332 --> 36:43.233
Not people, just those things.

36:44.903 --> 36:48.171
I can't hear them, they
rarely try to speak to me.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.739
They just show themselves.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.376
Even though I try to speak
to them, tell them to leave,

36:53.378 --> 36:54.611
there's never any sound.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.914
Sometimes they try
and show me images,

36:58.850 --> 37:00.717
then it all goes blurry.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.818
What kind of images?

37:02.921 --> 37:04.187
They come in dreams.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.857
They're usually centered
around a girl somewhere.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.926
Someone I've never seen.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.494
Don't even know if she exists.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.732
I know she's dead because
they show me her death.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.301
How does she die?

37:18.303 --> 37:19.603
She jumps off a building.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.039
And then she vanishes.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.076
And you don't
know where she goes?

37:26.078 --> 37:27.877
No, I don't.

37:27.879 --> 37:31.081
I usually wake up, but
that's the question

37:31.083 --> 37:32.782
they always seem to ask.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.989
The entities that appear to you,

37:39.891 --> 37:41.324
they want something from you.

37:42.527 --> 37:43.927
You may not know what it is,

37:45.364 --> 37:46.863
but you may think there's
nothing you can do

37:46.865 --> 37:48.431
and nothing you
will do for them,

37:50.569 --> 37:52.569
but they've been
patiently observing you.

37:54.473 --> 37:57.307
Waiting for the moment when
you'll give them what they want.

37:59.177 --> 38:03.446
They slowly, discreetly,
meticulously,

38:05.250 --> 38:07.083
move things in the
direction they want

38:09.488 --> 38:12.222
and it's up to you to get
out of this state of things.

38:13.225 --> 38:14.824
What should I do?

38:14.826 --> 38:16.159
First thing we're going to do

38:16.161 --> 38:17.294
is help you expand
your abilities.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.062
And it will be easier to get on

38:19.064 --> 38:21.331
if you two trust
each other and rely

38:21.333 --> 38:22.932
on each other's gift.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.035
Which is a sad word for
something that isn't a gift.

38:25.037 --> 38:28.872
Well, when we die our
conscience becomes pure energy.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.640
It's certain that
because of that,

38:30.642 --> 38:33.843
we become more susceptible
to electromagnetic influences

38:33.845 --> 38:35.679
much more so than
when we were alive.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.314
So electricity matters.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.648
Yes.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.651
Light bulbs, the sun,
other living creatures.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.887
They can all have an
effect on entities.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.922
It's like trying
to speak in a club

38:45.924 --> 38:47.891
which is filled with loud music.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.859
That was the 20th
century's gift to us,

38:49.861 --> 38:52.629
filling our environment
with noise and energy

38:52.631 --> 38:54.030
and disrupting a dialogue
that's been taking place

38:54.032 --> 38:55.965
since the dawn of mankind.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.667
It's not that the
entities aren't there,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.569
it's that we're the
ones who can neither see

38:59.571 --> 39:00.904
nor hear what they're saying.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.340
That's why they
always come in the dark.

39:03.342 --> 39:05.342
There's nothing like the dark.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.577
Of course we, we can get
pretty much the same effect

39:07.579 --> 39:10.513
if we keep the electromagnetic
noise to a safe minimum.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.883
In other cases, there's
a certain type of energy

39:13.885 --> 39:16.319
that attracts a
different type of entity.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.121
And those phenomena
are misunderstood,

39:18.123 --> 39:20.557
they're much more
physical than spiritual.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.292
You mean our laws are the same.

39:22.294 --> 39:23.626
Yes, of course.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.929
Dead or alive we're all
in the same universe.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.664
Governed by the same laws.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.100
Basically, there are
three types of ghosts.

39:30.102 --> 39:32.902
The first doesn't have
enough energy to move.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.238
It takes a lot of energy
to go against the air

39:35.240 --> 39:38.074
and cross a road, air is
a very poor conductor.

39:38.076 --> 39:41.644
When these ghosts appear, they
communicate but rarely move.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.280
The second type of ghost
has much more energy.

39:44.282 --> 39:46.750
They can move through the
air, follow you around,

39:46.752 --> 39:49.252
and even appear to
perform basic tasks.

39:49.254 --> 39:51.287
But even these ghosts will
never go through a wall.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.689
No ghosts will go through a wall

39:52.691 --> 39:54.157
if that wall makes
them lose energy.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.258
Think about it.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.694
Bricks, fiberglass, drywall,

39:57.696 --> 39:59.462
these are no good if
you're made of energy.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.065
Even these ghosts will
always choose an open door.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.934
Although there are some who
are capable of opening them

40:04.936 --> 40:07.303
which explains the
many accounts of doors

40:07.305 --> 40:09.506
opening and closing
by themselves.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.940
It's all true.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.075
My mother always
used to complain

40:12.077 --> 40:13.376
that I'd leave doors open.

40:14.479 --> 40:15.945
Now, the third type.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.349
Those are the dangerous ones.

40:19.351 --> 40:21.951
They can move through
walls if they want,

40:21.953 --> 40:25.822
they can cause short
circuits and even fire.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.826
They can cause great
harm and hurt you

40:29.828 --> 40:31.561
in lots of different ways.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.697
They feed off other
ghosts who avoid them

40:35.867 --> 40:37.400
or attach themselves
to the living.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.704
While the other
ghosts are benign,

40:41.706 --> 40:44.140
these types get frustrated
because they're not alive

40:44.142 --> 40:46.109
despite all their power.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.344
Then they grow into
something evil.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.813
Like the one who's after you.

40:51.383 --> 40:53.116
They're capable of sucking
large amounts of energy

40:53.118 --> 40:55.084
from various different means.

40:55.086 --> 40:58.455
AC outlets, kitchen
appliances, and so on.

40:58.457 --> 41:01.224
And then they use that
energy to affect you.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.092
Like when they try to
show you something.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.629
They'll never go away
until you can control

41:06.631 --> 41:09.098
your capacity to read them.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.133
But they always
used to come to me

41:10.135 --> 41:11.801
in larger numbers as a child.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.239
Yes, well, ghosts go
where the energy flows.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.142
What people do fail to realize

41:19.144 --> 41:21.778
is that it usually happens
when children are playing

41:21.780 --> 41:24.047
and the attraction is not
because they're children,

41:24.049 --> 41:26.249
but because children
come charged with energy.

41:27.652 --> 41:30.854
Grown ups can do it too,
just roll in the carpet.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.223
Fill your clothes with
electrostatic energy.

41:33.225 --> 41:36.059
You'll find most ghosts
will come closer.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.730
Elsa, give me your hand.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.766
God, it's cold.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.101
Yes, well, I'm scared.

41:46.638 --> 41:50.173
It's all right, let's just
relax and speak quietly.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.709
It's important at
this point to keep it

41:52.711 --> 41:54.644
and even the noise
we make to a minimum

41:54.646 --> 41:55.979
if we want to hear further.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.048
They'll start speaking
to you very soon.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.253
Now we're all sisters
and we must love

42:03.255 --> 42:04.787
each other as deeply as that.

42:06.057 --> 42:08.858
Rachel, take your sister's hand.

42:19.938 --> 42:23.439
No, no, no, it's all right,
this is just beginning.

42:23.441 --> 42:24.974
It's all right.

42:24.976 --> 42:28.878
Maria is here, she responded
to your open hearts.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
Don't let it go.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.882
Fear only destroys what
we're trying to build.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.217
Now calm down.

42:35.487 --> 42:39.155
Elsa, you're a visual
medium, open your eyes.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.057
I'm afraid to.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.692
There's nothing to be afraid of.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.361
I assure you you
won't see anything

42:45.363 --> 42:47.163
to scare you unless you want to.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.233
Trust me.

42:50.135 --> 42:52.101
Don't be afraid.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.836
You did nothing to them.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.939
You owe them nothing.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.941
There's nothing to be afraid of.

42:59.177 --> 43:01.110
Maria just wants you to
know that she's here.

43:09.955 --> 43:10.753
First type?

43:10.755 --> 43:11.755
Correct.

43:13.124 --> 43:14.324
It's all right, darling.

43:15.493 --> 43:19.495
Maria wants to
tell you something.

43:28.840 --> 43:33.743
She says blessed are those
who come in the name of Christ.

43:39.884 --> 43:41.884
It's all right, darling.

43:41.886 --> 43:45.989
There's a man called Albert.

43:47.225 --> 43:48.291
He says that uh,

43:49.861 --> 43:53.563
they recorded precious
information on the film.

43:55.133 --> 43:58.768
He's talking about a hunter.

44:27.265 --> 44:28.331
It's okay, darling.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.832
Relax, now breathe deeply.

44:40.679 --> 44:44.514
Don't worry, don't worry,
that was only a doppelganger.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.883
It was only a doppelganger.

44:46.885 --> 44:50.219
A mirror image of the hunter
designed to confuse and scare.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.490
That's why it's gone so
quickly, they don't last long.

44:56.494 --> 45:01.297
The real entity is hiding
somewhere observing you.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.334
It's all right, it's gone now.

45:06.137 --> 45:07.503
What's a hunter?

45:09.708 --> 45:12.642
A hunter is an evil entity.

45:12.644 --> 45:16.179
It's not yet fully a demon,
it wants to become one.

45:17.549 --> 45:18.815
It's trying to become one.

45:19.918 --> 45:21.584
It can do horrible things.

45:23.221 --> 45:27.290
It's often commanded by
demons acting on their behalf.

45:27.292 --> 45:29.892
But if it's not a demon,
that's a good thing, right?

45:31.062 --> 45:32.062
Actually no.

45:33.131 --> 45:34.931
Hunters are very rare.

45:36.634 --> 45:38.935
The demons in this
case are looking

45:38.937 --> 45:40.970
for something that
only a hunter can get.

45:42.674 --> 45:44.974
Remember what I told you
about the 20th century?

45:44.976 --> 45:46.676
Yes.

45:46.678 --> 45:50.913
All the electromagnetic
noise and technology it brought

45:50.915 --> 45:53.349
made the life of
demons much harder.

45:53.351 --> 45:54.717
What do you mean?

45:56.821 --> 46:00.056
The hunters in this
case are investigating,

46:00.058 --> 46:04.293
learning, searching for something
that only demons can use.

46:05.296 --> 46:06.796
A crack through the wall.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.800
We've made their work all the
harder with all our noise.

46:12.237 --> 46:13.603
And now they're biting back.

46:16.574 --> 46:18.407
It's up to us to
find out what it is.

46:27.085 --> 46:29.051
Looks like a
design for a patent.

46:29.053 --> 46:30.720
How old is it?

46:30.722 --> 46:34.957
Looks like something from
Thomas Moss or Edison or Tesla

46:36.161 --> 46:38.261
or someone from those
days, or earlier.

46:38.263 --> 46:41.297
Oh, seems like an
incomplete telegraph

46:41.299 --> 46:43.533
that's connected to
an infinite distance

46:43.535 --> 46:45.568
through an infinite cable.

46:45.570 --> 46:47.036
A kind of telegraph?

46:47.038 --> 46:49.572
Defective one, but yes.

46:49.574 --> 46:51.073
Oh, how do you operate it?

46:51.075 --> 46:52.542
I don't see how it
can receive anything

46:52.544 --> 46:54.043
or how it's operated.

46:54.045 --> 46:56.946
Ooh, it's half a
telegraph system at best.

46:59.617 --> 47:01.717
Don't tell me this is
one of the negatives

47:01.719 --> 47:02.919
the ghost gave you.

47:02.921 --> 47:03.920
Yes.

47:03.922 --> 47:06.455
Are you out of your damn mind?

47:06.457 --> 47:08.524
How are we supposed to
make this look scientific?

47:08.526 --> 47:10.359
We don't until
we see if it works!

47:10.361 --> 47:14.030
We're scientists, not
witches for God's sake.

47:14.032 --> 47:16.299
The more I trust you, the
more I think you're helping us

47:16.301 --> 47:18.668
to make this amazing
leap into the future,

47:18.670 --> 47:20.469
the more you bury
yourself in shit.

47:20.471 --> 47:21.704
You know I'm right.

47:21.706 --> 47:23.973
Then we'll be right and broke.

47:23.975 --> 47:25.274
The fucking Swedes will pick up

47:25.276 --> 47:26.943
where we die, is
that what you want?

47:26.945 --> 47:29.445
I have to submit a report
based on what we're doing.

47:29.447 --> 47:30.980
Something that's supposed to be

47:30.982 --> 47:34.884
a technological breakthrough
and you bring me this!

47:34.886 --> 47:36.552
Fuck you, Helen.

47:36.554 --> 47:37.453
You're fired!

47:37.455 --> 47:39.155
I signed a contract.

47:39.157 --> 47:40.990
Well I didn't.

47:58.343 --> 47:59.343
Hey.

48:00.845 --> 48:03.412
Gosh, these notes
are incredible.

48:05.817 --> 48:07.083
Did they actually
write all of this?

48:07.085 --> 48:08.085
Mm hmm.

48:10.455 --> 48:13.022
I couldn't work out
what the diagram meant

48:13.024 --> 48:14.423
so I took it to Dr. Steinman.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.059
That went down well.

48:17.061 --> 48:19.428
Anyway, he thinks it's some
sort of communication device

48:19.430 --> 48:21.130
or sort of telegraph.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.098
Can I see it again?

48:22.100 --> 48:23.100
Mm hmm.

48:26.437 --> 48:27.536
There you go.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.109
What matters is what it does.

48:33.111 --> 48:36.012
If we manage to find out how
to make it work and control it.

48:37.949 --> 48:39.949
This looks simple enough.

48:39.951 --> 48:41.117
Let's build it.

48:41.119 --> 48:42.685
What?

48:42.687 --> 48:43.687
Let's make one.

48:49.694 --> 48:52.328
Okay, I'm gonna need
these two 3D printers.

48:53.564 --> 48:54.730
I'll take these.

48:56.634 --> 48:58.534
Here you go.

48:58.536 --> 48:59.735
- All right.
- And this scanner.

48:59.737 --> 49:01.904
Yes, I've got it.

49:01.906 --> 49:04.106
Okay.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.274
Think that's it.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.209
- That's it?
- Let's go.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.254
Are you building
it all in plastic?

49:18.256 --> 49:20.089
A few parts, yeah.

49:20.091 --> 49:21.657
What about the other parts?

49:21.659 --> 49:23.526
Well I can't print the
copper and ceramic parts here,

49:23.528 --> 49:26.329
but I can operate the larger
printers back at the studio.

49:26.331 --> 49:28.164
Should be ready by
the time we get there.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.498
Oh, all right.

49:29.500 --> 49:30.933
You'll go then, I'll
stay here, yeah?

49:30.935 --> 49:31.935
Perfect.

49:39.510 --> 49:40.510
Done.

50:34.866 --> 50:36.766
You, you know I can't see you.

50:40.038 --> 50:41.038
I can hear you.

50:43.908 --> 50:45.207
I'm not afraid of you!

50:47.879 --> 50:50.079
Don't be afraid of me.

51:05.530 --> 51:07.263
Why are you afraid of us?

51:07.265 --> 51:08.297
Stay hiding.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.100
Don't look!

51:23.581 --> 51:25.948
Helen, are you okay?

51:25.950 --> 51:27.550
I feel something.

51:27.552 --> 51:29.852
Something I haven't
felt in years.

51:29.854 --> 51:31.020
There's something going
on back at the apartment.

51:31.022 --> 51:32.354
We've got to go.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.356
Okay, I'll get the
pieces, let's go.

51:36.961 --> 51:37.961
Rachel!

51:38.896 --> 51:40.629
Hey, it's all right.

51:40.631 --> 51:42.465
I'll stay, you go
and have a look.

51:42.467 --> 51:44.066
It's all right, darling.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.335
What?

51:46.337 --> 51:47.570
What happened?

51:47.572 --> 51:49.872
- I saw it.
- Oh no.

51:49.874 --> 51:51.373
It's all right, it's all right.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.642
Here, here, here,
here, drink some water.

51:53.644 --> 51:54.577
It's all right.

51:54.579 --> 51:55.578
There.

51:55.580 --> 51:58.380
I saw it and it scared me.

51:58.382 --> 52:00.449
It's gone, it's gone now.

52:00.451 --> 52:02.318
It's all right.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.619
It's all right.

52:03.621 --> 52:06.522
Calm down, darling,
it'll be okay.

52:06.524 --> 52:07.923
We're here now.

52:07.925 --> 52:09.125
It's all right.

52:11.896 --> 52:12.896
How's it going?

52:14.298 --> 52:16.132
This drawing doesn't
say how the device works,

52:16.134 --> 52:19.335
but it's clear that it
stores kinetic energy

52:19.337 --> 52:21.670
without the need for an
external power source.

52:21.672 --> 52:22.638
How do you know?

52:22.640 --> 52:24.707
Well how else would it work?

52:24.709 --> 52:28.110
This comes from a time when
electricity was a novelty.

52:28.112 --> 52:29.712
Perhaps that's why
it was forgotten.

52:31.349 --> 52:33.449
Maybe it was ahead of its time.

52:33.451 --> 52:35.317
Can we try it?

52:35.319 --> 52:37.019
Well, it'll take
some time to connect

52:37.021 --> 52:39.155
but I've got some cable.

52:39.157 --> 52:40.489
We can try.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.124
Besides, we've got to
start somewhere.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.463
What?

52:47.465 --> 52:48.465
I feel something.

52:51.169 --> 52:52.368
Let me try something.

52:54.238 --> 52:55.638
What is it?

52:55.640 --> 52:56.939
Well, this scanner
picks up frequencies

52:56.941 --> 52:58.941
outside the visual spectrum.

52:58.943 --> 53:00.976
Don't move, I'm
gonna scan your body.

53:08.019 --> 53:09.019
What do you see?

53:10.154 --> 53:12.087
Something attached to you.

53:12.089 --> 53:13.889
It's the girl in my dreams.

53:19.230 --> 53:20.230
Oh my god.

53:21.499 --> 53:22.932
It's you.

53:22.934 --> 53:23.934
Who?

53:25.236 --> 53:26.302
The one that's
been following me.

53:26.304 --> 53:28.771
It's, it's right here, it's!

53:29.774 --> 53:32.041
It's looking at you.

53:32.043 --> 53:33.442
Rachel, can you hear it?

53:33.444 --> 53:35.244
Yeah, I can hear it.

53:37.248 --> 53:40.416
Oh my God, it's
the same laughter.

53:42.153 --> 53:43.385
I get it now, Helen.

53:44.956 --> 53:47.116
Those images she was talking
about of the girl falling.

53:48.092 --> 53:49.124
It was Lilly.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.695
I recognized the drawings
at the studio but

53:52.697 --> 53:54.029
I thought it was a
coincidence but...

53:54.031 --> 53:56.532
There are no coincidences!

53:56.534 --> 53:58.067
It's following you now.

53:58.069 --> 54:00.035
It found you, it's
laughing at you!

54:12.250 --> 54:14.917
I can see the son of a bitch.

54:16.654 --> 54:18.053
Wh-wh-what do I do?

54:18.055 --> 54:20.055
Concentrate and look through it.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.257
I can't.

54:21.259 --> 54:22.558
Yes, you can.

54:24.128 --> 54:28.530
It's not there physically,
it's only there spiritually.

54:30.034 --> 54:33.636
Try to ignore it and see through
it, your brain will obey.

54:33.638 --> 54:35.537
Ugh, it doesn't work!

54:35.539 --> 54:37.339
If you want you
can get close to it

54:37.341 --> 54:38.974
and pass your hand through it,

54:38.976 --> 54:41.877
telling your own
soul it's not there!

54:41.879 --> 54:43.445
Ah, its voice.

54:43.447 --> 54:45.080
Oh, it's filthy!

54:45.082 --> 54:46.348
Do you have any idea what

54:46.350 --> 54:48.017
this thing did to
me at the beach?

54:48.019 --> 54:50.853
If it had wanted to hurt you
it would've done so already.

54:50.855 --> 54:55.791
Besides, I know what it
wants and it's not you.

54:58.963 --> 55:00.596
But it won't get anything!

55:02.433 --> 55:03.433
Not now!

55:04.335 --> 55:05.335
Not ever!

55:14.145 --> 55:15.210
It's gone.

55:32.530 --> 55:33.562
We should go home.

55:34.932 --> 55:36.031
We're all exhausted.

55:36.934 --> 55:39.101
We haven't slept in ages.

55:39.103 --> 55:41.437
There's something
missing from this device.

55:41.439 --> 55:42.971
Seems to be very sensitive.

55:44.275 --> 55:45.774
Well you won't pick up
anything during the day,

55:45.776 --> 55:48.477
there's simply too
much noise going on.

55:48.479 --> 55:50.679
It's not just
picking up signals,

55:50.681 --> 55:52.414
it's also sending
back tiny currents

55:52.416 --> 55:54.249
that get stored near the coil.

55:54.251 --> 55:56.051
We'll just have to
wait for nighttime.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.220
Oh, I can't stop now,
I've almost finished.

55:59.523 --> 56:01.523
Rachel, why don't you
go have a lie-down, hmm?

56:01.525 --> 56:02.858
What about you?

56:02.860 --> 56:04.326
I'll just stay
till she's finished

56:04.328 --> 56:05.894
then we'll all go home.

56:05.896 --> 56:06.896
Okay.

56:16.707 --> 56:18.340
Is this the plastic
that the entity

56:18.342 --> 56:19.742
was trying to manipulate?

56:19.744 --> 56:21.110
Yeah.

56:21.112 --> 56:22.978
It was trying to chew it.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.546
Eat it?

56:24.548 --> 56:28.484
Couldn't eat it, obviously,
but it was chewing it.

56:28.486 --> 56:30.819
Spitting out bits of it.

56:30.821 --> 56:33.555
Half chewed, half melted.

56:37.661 --> 56:39.178
Why?

56:39.179 --> 56:40.696
It simply doesn't make
sense that an entity

56:40.698 --> 56:42.264
would spend so much time trying

56:42.266 --> 56:44.133
to digest something
it simply can't.

56:45.736 --> 56:46.736
It's absurd.

56:47.538 --> 56:49.104
And what about those coins?

56:49.106 --> 56:50.706
What was all that about?

56:50.708 --> 56:52.341
I don't make the rules.

56:52.343 --> 56:54.109
That's true.

56:54.111 --> 56:58.380
We don't make the rules, but
this entity thinks it can.

56:59.550 --> 57:03.819
He's been watching
you, us, that.

57:06.624 --> 57:08.157
We must be missing something.

57:10.694 --> 57:12.961
There must be something
it's trying to achieve.

57:18.669 --> 57:20.936
God, I'm too tired.

57:23.374 --> 57:27.609
Wake me up when you're
finished, hm, and then we'll go.

57:58.976 --> 58:03.612
I still remember it as
if it was yesterday.

58:08.219 --> 58:09.451
No!

58:09.453 --> 58:11.053
- Helen!
- Let me go!

58:11.055 --> 58:12.855
- Stop!
- Lilly!

58:12.857 --> 58:14.089
Helen, stop!

58:15.759 --> 58:16.892
Let me go!

58:16.894 --> 58:17.894
Helen!

58:27.304 --> 58:28.544
My darling.

58:30.107 --> 58:31.773
Can you hear mommy?

58:33.244 --> 58:35.410
I know you're still in there.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.647
I love you.

58:38.649 --> 58:40.716
Don't be afraid.

58:45.556 --> 58:48.490
Now listen carefully, my love.

58:48.492 --> 58:52.361
A mother's heart is a fortress.

58:52.363 --> 58:54.997
They will never find you.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.000
Can you feel mommy's heart?

58:59.570 --> 59:01.103
You'll be safe here.

59:02.706 --> 59:06.575
Deep inside mommy's heart
forever and ever and ever.

59:19.323 --> 59:23.492
Another day and you're
still with me, my darling.

59:27.097 --> 59:28.097
Another day

59:31.669 --> 59:32.734
after so many years.

59:34.338 --> 59:37.105
I don't know who's keeping who.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.417
But thank you God

59:51.055 --> 59:52.421
for one more day.

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:33.062
Rachel.

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:35.465
Rachel.

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:06.788
Come on.

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:09.859
Hi.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.160
Hello, Rachel.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.162
Hi.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.267
Hope I didn't
come at a bad time.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:20.936
No, not at all.

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:23.205
Helen is resting, we've
been working all night.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.643
What are you doing here?

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:30.946
I came to talk
to you about this.

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:33.281
This doesn't
concern you anymore.

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:34.850
You fired me.

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:37.319
This is my research now as it

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.954
should've been in
the first place.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.222
I need it.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:41.823
I want to test it in the lab.

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:44.960
Are you out of your bloody mind?

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:46.562
Do you think I'm gonna
give you anything?

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.932
Oh, get out, I've
got work to do.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.905
Do you want me to
call the police?

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.707
That won't be necessary.

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:01.409
All I want is the device.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.313
When I think of all things
you said to me yesterday,

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.215
you know, after all these years

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:09.451
you never fail to surprise me.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:10.819
You're a disgrace to science!

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.925
That only makes it worse.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.128
We've got to find Elsa.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.296
I can hear you.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:23.899
Don't let go of my hand.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.434
All I want is the device, Helen.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.037
This way.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.039
I can hear you!

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:32.307
Don't let go of me.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.821
It's all right, darling.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:47.956
This way.

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:51.126
- It's all right.
- Towards the door.

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:52.360
Pay attention.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:56.932
It's them.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.694
- They're afraid.
- We don't want you to die.

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:04.039
Don't let go.

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:05.473
Oh, Helen!

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:06.842
- Rachel!
- Helen!

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:07.844
Helen!

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:10.478
- Helen!
- Rachel, where are you?

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.480
Helen!

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:13.448
Rachel.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.050
Helen.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:15.817
Rachel!

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:16.952
Helen.

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:17.954
Helen!

01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:20.021
Rachel?

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.757
Helen!

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:29.899
Helen!

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:34.703
Helen!

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:37.039
Helen!

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.377
Helen!

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.580
Helen!

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.816
- Helen!
- What's happening?

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:49.284
It's in there with her!

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.286
Helen!

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.727
Don't touch her.

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:06.735
Helen, open the door!

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:08.436
Hey, what's going on?

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.704
Helen!

01:05:10.841 --> 01:05:12.207
Helen.

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.745
Helen, tell us what happened.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:18.313
She's lost it.

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:19.247
Would you please shut up,

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.548
can't you see what's happening?

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.150
Please tell me
what is happening.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.018
Dr. Steinman, please.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.552
Oh, that's brilliant.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.621
I have millions of euros
worth of scientific research,

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:28.156
freshly approved,
hanging by a thread

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.658
because you're all going crazy.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.625
You don't understand, do you?

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:33.061
No, you don't understand.

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.462
Do you know the
magnitude of this?

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:35.664
You just can't go nuts.

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.265
What do you want?

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.233
It's not what I want
because I already have it,

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:39.968
it's what it does.

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:43.271
So, you found a way to build
it using those printers.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.372
Did you test the thing?

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:45.707
Not yet.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:47.275
Then we have a long
night ahead of us.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.643
Start working.

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:50.111
You're out of your bloody mind.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:51.846
Can't you see the
state Helen's in?

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:55.050
I'm a doctor too,
we don't need Helen.

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:56.818
If the device works
at least partially,

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.886
then I'll know we're
on the right track

01:05:57.888 --> 01:05:59.154
and we can all go home knowing

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:00.722
there's more happy work ahead.

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:03.358
What if it doesn't?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.693
Then I suppose I'll
have to find a way

01:06:04.695 --> 01:06:08.063
to explain that after
some tragic event

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:10.832
Dr. Helen Stevens and
her loony assistants

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:13.034
were replaced by
real scientists.

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:14.936
If Helen's theory is correct,

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:18.340
a device like this could tap
directly into a person's soul.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:20.909
All we have to do is to
find out how to operate it.

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:23.311
Oh, well, let me just
check the instruction manual.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:24.579
Very funny.

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:29.918
Can you control the current
that runs into the device?

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.553
The coils vibrate by themselves,

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:34.389
affected by the electromagnetic
fields that they encounter.

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:38.460
The computer merely registers
what comes from the device.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.862
Hopefully in 10
years' time a device

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:42.731
with these same qualities
will be implanted

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:44.733
into the patient's head.

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:45.767
It'll be amazing.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.871
And all this comes from ghosts.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.740
Truly fantastic.

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:52.774
Do you believe it?

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:55.777
The human mind has the
most amazing capacity

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:58.113
to justify its brilliance.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.714
If Helen believes she
can talk to ghosts

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:02.250
and come up with amazing
concepts, that's fine.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:03.952
I'll believe her.

01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:05.820
But what really
happens inside her mind

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.323
is beyond her current
ability to explain.

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:09.524
Meaning?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.693
I believe in results.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.496
What happened will
always be debatable.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:17.399
What can be patented
is all that matters.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:34.917
Listen.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.219
It's talking.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.422
What are you feeling, Rachel?

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.260
Um.

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:49.230
I'm feeling uh something.

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:54.903
Tell me exactly
what you're feeling.

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:59.908
Uh, I don't know, uh, light?

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:01.943
Is that all?

01:08:01.945 --> 01:08:02.945
Yeah.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.980
No.

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:07.315
- I don't know.
- Oh, get up!

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:08.317
What?

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.252
I'm sitting in it myself,
let's see what I can feel.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.955
And don't try anything funny.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:14.957
I can use this.

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:45.086
What do you see?

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.321
The field is stronger.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.492
More current is being generated.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:54.929
Hm, I see.

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:57.433
Interesting.

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:02.804
I could hear it but I
couldn't understand it.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.209
Oh, I can understand
it perfectly.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:19.888
Fascinating.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.160
Really fascinating.

01:09:32.035 --> 01:09:33.301
What happened?

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.670
I made contact with the device.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.671
It spoke to me.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:40.073
It told me what to do.

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:43.178
It told me exactly
how to test it.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.618
You happy now, you fuck?

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.656
What the fuck are you doing?

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:55.657
Please don't.

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:57.492
We'll do anything you ask us,

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.093
we've already done that already!

01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:01.062
Of course you will.

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:04.699
But you see, I understand
what we need to achieve.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.368
Stop, think about
what you're doing!

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.871
What do you expect to get
from her when she's dead?

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.839
The device works
with a living brain.

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:13.274
You've seen it, it won't
work with the dead.

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:16.711
I don't want her to die, but.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:21.216
No!

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.018
Now we can test this properly.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.322
Please call an
ambulance, please!

01:10:27.324 --> 01:10:32.293
Helen, please tell me
do you know who you are?

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:36.097
Please.

01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:40.368
Helen, please tell me your name.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.978
Helen, please tell me your name.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:58.987
Helen, is that you?

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:05.593
Please be a nice girl
and tell me your name.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:10.331
Helen.

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:13.235
Very good.

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:16.304
Let's do an exercise.

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:19.974
Try to count backwards
from 100 in sevens.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880
Please!

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:27.315
Please!

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.183
100, 93, 86.

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:33.821
She's going to die!

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.357
Yes she is, and
I think we've only

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:37.959
one more minute before
she passes away.

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.093
- Helen.
- Please.

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:41.496
Do you know what happened?

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:46.234
Your daughter?

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.337
Fascinating.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:53.174
Christ's sake,
I need to take you.

01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:56.344
Break the scanner now.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.216
Can't even feel a pulse anymore.

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:10.325
Well, I suppose that part
of our testing's concluded.

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.695
I'm sure you agree with
me the device works.

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:15.330
I'll kill you.

01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:17.498
You'll burn in hell!

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.667
I have to think
about the next tests

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.536
we're going to do tonight.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:25.540
I've got one test
subject done, two to go.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:28.042
You fucking cunt.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:31.279
In the meantime, you stay here.

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:35.216
And please, try to keep quiet.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.685
Otherwise I may
have to hurt you.

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:49.130
I could've prevented this.

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:50.465
No you couldn't.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.833
You would be dead, too.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.070
What are we gonna do?

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:57.372
I don't know.

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:02.276
What's
happening, what's happening?

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:04.112
I don't know!

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.239
You've been following me.

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:20.314
The one that's missing.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:24.986
That's the one who's been
looking for me all these years.

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:29.690
That's the one who tricked my
Lilly into killing herself.

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:33.962
Isn't it?

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:39.534
You train your children
just like we train ours.

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:46.107
And you used my life
as your testing ground.

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:51.647
Didn't you?

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:54.382
You bastards.

01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:08.896
Those girls are innocent.

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.767
You already got what you wanted.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.902
You don't need them, too.

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:19.534
Helen.

01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:22.570
Please, tell me your name.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.773
Helen.

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.942
Please, tell me your name.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:35.282
You stay here and please
try to keep quiet.

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.785
Otherwise, I may
have to hurt you.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:49.563
I could've prevented this.

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:50.564
No, you couldn't.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:51.932
You would be dead, too.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.137
Ugh, what are we gonna do?

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:57.438
I don't know.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.147
What's
happening, what's happening

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.281
what's happening,
what's happening?

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:08.716
I have no idea!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.520
It's my scanner.

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.754
I can hear.

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:15.923
I can hear something
approaching.

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.158
I can hear it.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:20.961
I can hear something
approaching.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:22.163
Can you see it?

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:24.131
I can't see it.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:25.266
Can you see it?

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:26.934
Stay quiet.

01:18:28.237 --> 01:18:31.338
What the hell
is it, what's it doing?

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.307
Oh my printer.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:35.443
Stay quiet!

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:35.569
Can you see it?

01:19:35.571 --> 01:19:37.972
What the hell's it,
what's it doing?

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:41.509
What's happening?

01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:42.710
What's it doing?

01:19:42.712 --> 01:19:44.044
Stay quiet!

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.312
What the fuck is that?

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:47.114
It's printing itself.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:49.683
What is it doing, what is that?

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:52.086
It's coming to life.

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:57.892
Somebody help
us, somebody help us!

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.093
Somebody help.

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:02.931
Help.

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:04.666
Help.

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:07.235
Help, help.

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:12.073
Help.

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:14.041
Oh my God.

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:43.103
No!

01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:44.105
Please no!

01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:17.304
What the fuck is going on?

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:30.511
Help, help,
help, somebody help us!

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:33.781
It's printing copies of itself.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:36.251
Stay quiet.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:41.623
Help!

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:44.124
Help!

01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:56.236
- Help!
- Help!

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:00.374
Help us!
