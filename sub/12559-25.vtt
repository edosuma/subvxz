THOSE IN THE STUDY.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.909
ALL RIGHT. IT'S

00:42.000 --> 00:43.866

00:43.961 --> 00:46.749
NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD AT ALL.
THE DOOTOR'S VVITH HIM NOVV,

00:46.838 --> 00:49.421
BUT HE VVANTS TO BE ADVISED
VVHEN THE RELATIVES ARRIVE.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.215
THOSE RELATIVES OF HIS.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.794

MAKE THEMSELVES KNOWN.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.305

01:15.993 --> 01:20.453
JASON, I HAVE BEEN YOUR
PHYSICIAN NOW FOR 25 YEARS,

01:20.539 --> 01:22.906
AND THE FIRST TIME I TREATED
YOU FOR A HEAD COLD

01:22.958 --> 01:26.326
AND I ALLOWED MYSELF
ONE COMPASSIONATE CLUCK,

01:26.420 --> 01:28.206
YOU THREW
A LAMP AT ME.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.914
THAT ESTABLISHED THE PATTERN
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

01:31.008 --> 01:35.252
I HA\/E PUT UP VVITH YOUR INEPT
MINISTRATIONS ALL THESE YEARS

01:35.345 --> 01:38.428
BECAUSE YOUR CANDOR IS
A REFRESHING DEPARTURE

01:38.515 --> 01:41.257
FROM THE MODERN
MEDICAL NORM.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.847
I ASK YOU A STRAIGHT,
SIMPLE QUESTION,

01:43.937 --> 01:46.474

<i>THE OFT-ASKED QUESTWON OF THE

<i>TELL ME, SAM,
DO I HAVE A WEEK?</i>

02:00.370 --> 02:02.953
DO I HAVE A DAY

02:08.461 --> 02:10.669

THAT YOU CAN MEASURE
YOUR LIFE IN MOMENTS.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.667
<i>IT CAN COME

02:15.761 --> 02:17.672
<i>BUT THAT FACT

02:17.763 --> 02:20.130

<i>THA T MOST OF US
DON'T EVEN POSSESS.</i>

02:22.309 --> 02:26.974
NONSENSE. IT'S ATTRIBUTABLE TO
A CROSS-GRAINED ORNERINESS.

02:27.064 --> 02:30.398
AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE
ONE OR TVVO THINGS LEFT TO DO

02:30.484 --> 02:33.397
BEFORE I LEAVE
THIS EARTH.

02:33.487 --> 02:38.982

IT DOESN'T MATTER, FATHER.
I'LL MUDDLE THROUGH.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.950
YOU ARE THE FOUR MOST OHANGELESS
PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH.

06:17.043 --> 06:21.207
I DON'T LIKE BEING SO ILL, FATHER,

06:21.256 --> 06:25.215
<i>DON'T YOU? WELL, I FIND
THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.</i>

06:25.260 --> 06:28.048

HOW'S BUSINESS?

06:41.318 --> 06:44.811
OH, MAKING A LITTLE,
LOSING A LITTLE, FATHER,

06:44.905 --> 06:47.237
BUT I MANAGE TO KEEP
MY HEAD ABOVE WATER.

06:47.324 --> 06:52.945
YOU KNOVV, VVILFRED, I THINK THE ONLY
BOOK YOU EVER READ VVAS A LEDGER.

06:53.038 --> 06:57.578

THEY VVOULD FIND A CASH REGISTER.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.001

OH, REALLY, FATHER?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.169

NOW, THAT'S FRIENDLY
OF YOU TO TELL ME THAT.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.847
CONSIDERING THAT YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN ME, YET.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.020
ALL YOU'VE SEEN IS
YOUR MIRROR IMAGE.

07:20.106 --> 07:24.441
OH, GRANDFATHER, YOU'RE \/ERY
NAUGHTY, REALLY, YOU ARE.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.444

SICK HEART.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.884
OH, PERHAPS NOT
THE SAME DEGREE

OF EXCITEMENT THAT YOU GET
FROM TORTURING SMALL ANIMALS

NO, NO, BUT
NECESSARY, ASSUREDLY.

EXAMINED YOUR MASKS?

YOU KNOW, THEY ARE
MADE BY AN OLD CAJUN.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.409
