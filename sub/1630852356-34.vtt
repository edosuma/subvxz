08:46.351 --> 08:47.875
Father, you fool.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.485
He is intangible.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.182
- Please let me go.
- [Croblin cackling]

08:51.226 --> 08:52.836
Bulk snatch!

08:52.880 --> 08:54.272
Ew, why are you wet?

08:54.316 --> 08:55.883
Ew, ew, gross!

08:55.926 --> 08:57.101
I'm free!

08:57.145 --> 08:58.712
Perhaps your fatheris right.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.888
Woman and ghost
can't be together.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.193
That's just the thing.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.935
For I was a ghost all along!

09:04.979 --> 09:06.633
Wh-Wh-What?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.548
Honey Belle, why didn't youtell me sooner?

09:08.591 --> 09:10.593
For tension.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.074
And they died
happily ever after, the end.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.641
[yawns]

09:14.684 --> 09:16.251
Wow, what a rush.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.861
Remy, you were great.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.734
I was just riding off the
energyyou brought to the scene.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.842
Though it doesn't seem
likeanyone actually liked it.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.564
It's impossible
to please everyone.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.653
But as long as you like
what you make,

09:26.696 --> 09:28.089
that's all that matters.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.786
Hey, everyone,
the line's moving.

09:29.830 --> 09:30.874
[all chatter]

09:30.918 --> 09:32.833
I see a lot of theater,

09:32.876 --> 09:36.793
and I must say this play was
adelightful avant-garde aperitif.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.622
I was going to give these roses
to the star of today's show,

09:39.666 --> 09:41.885
but I want to give them
to you instead.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.670
I no longer crave
your validation,

09:43.713 --> 09:45.759
but I do appreciate it.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.891
Oh, okay, I'll just
keep these then.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.066
Gimme.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.764
[all grunt and groan]

09:50.807 --> 09:52.200
It's over, losers.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.332
You go back to that garbage,
where you belong.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.943
It ain't over yet.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.119
I still have one more trick
up my sleeve.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.776
[chanting in foreign tongue]

10:08.999 --> 10:10.392
I've heard of war and peace,

10:10.435 --> 10:11.978
but this is war and please
make it stop.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.395
Am I right, Alice?

10:13.438 --> 10:14.831
You'd better muzzle your grill

10:14.875 --> 10:16.441
if you know what's good for you.

10:16.485 --> 10:20.054
I hate plenty of things,
but my family ain't one of them.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.490
I'm out!

10:21.533 --> 10:22.970
My only friend, gone.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.582
[grunting]

10:26.626 --> 10:28.584
Guys, now,
while they're distracted.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.586
- Huh?
- [grunting]

10:31.718 --> 10:32.893
America Rat!

10:32.936 --> 10:35.156
[all moaning]

10:35.199 --> 10:36.679
Oh, my gosh.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.830
They're just a couple
of teenagers.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.769
And one old man?

10:39.813 --> 10:41.553
And I would've
gotten away with it

10:41.597 --> 10:43.381
if it weren't
for that meddling kid.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.427
Come on, Dustin.
Come on, Chance.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.950
Let's get out of here.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.996
[all grunt]

10:49.039 --> 10:50.954
[yelling]

10:50.998 --> 10:52.347
We did it, everyone.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.827
The block is ours.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.306
Wow, hey, look at these
superheroes.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.023
- Can we get a picture?
- Line up, everyone.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.310
Kid Cricket takes cash or card.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.878
- Don't even think about it.
- Respect.
