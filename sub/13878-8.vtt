Tonight's
episode ... "Jumpy George."

00:37.779 --> 00:38.589
Hey, man!

00:38.714 --> 00:39.723
Slap me some skin, brother!

00:39.848 --> 00:42.025
No, I'm not gonna do that.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.861
Come on, let's
seal the deal, baby!

00:43.986 --> 00:44.294
No.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.195
On the paw!

00:45.320 --> 00:47.131
No, I seen you put
the freaking thing on.

00:47.256 --> 00:47.898
I'm not doing it.

00:48.023 --> 00:48.732
Shake it.

00:48.857 --> 00:50.200
I'll shake your other hand.

00:50.325 --> 00:51.568
I'm not gonna shake that hand.

00:51.693 --> 00:52.236
This one.

00:52.361 --> 00:53.303
Shake hands with this one.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.671
No, I'm not doing it.

00:54.796 --> 00:57.174
When you least expect
it, you're getting the whammy.

00:57.299 --> 01:00.811
Look, I ain't gonna trifle with
no cheap dollar store crap, all right?

01:00.936 --> 01:03.981
I invested in some
serious technology here.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.081
Check it out.

01:05.206 --> 01:05.883
X-ray goggles.

01:06.008 --> 01:07.084
Give them to me!

01:07.209 --> 01:09.853
You don't whip those out until
you spot the major boobage.

01:09.978 --> 01:10.521
And taco.

01:10.646 --> 01:11.555
'Cause taco is king.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.623
What's that?

01:12.748 --> 01:13.524
Is that a broad?

01:13.649 --> 01:16.727
Hey, I noticed you don't
have any rings on your finger!

01:16.852 --> 01:17.027
Whoo!

01:17.152 --> 01:19.897
Hey, I noticed you ain't
got no rings on your finger.

01:20.022 --> 01:20.864
Hey, babe.

01:20.989 --> 01:22.666
You look like a milf I'd love to meet.

01:22.791 --> 01:23.934
Hey, you seem single.

01:24.059 --> 01:24.802
What's your name?

01:24.927 --> 01:27.237
I'm interested in your and your
things, the things you say.

01:27.996 --> 01:28.205
Aah!

01:28.330 --> 01:29.239
Carl, your cologne!

01:29.364 --> 01:30.040
He's lying!

01:30.165 --> 01:31.108
He sprayed me with fart spray!

01:31.233 --> 01:32.709
He who smelt it dealt it!

01:32.834 --> 01:33.877
What are you doing this weekend?

01:34.002 --> 01:34.912
Yeah, or tonight.

01:35.037 --> 01:36.513
What about this afternoon?

01:36.638 --> 01:37.214
Or right now?

01:37.339 --> 01:38.215
I'm good to go right now.

01:38.340 --> 01:38.916
Let's do this.

01:39.041 --> 01:39.883
Carl, please.

01:40.008 --> 01:40.751
You smell like farts.

01:40.876 --> 01:43.020
You spray me again, so
help me God, I'll break every

01:43.145 --> 01:46.023
freaking yellow finger in your
hand in front of this beautiful

01:46.148 --> 01:47.124
broad and her two kids.

01:47.249 --> 01:49.092
I really want to know
their names, too.

01:49.217 --> 01:50.060
I'm way into kids.

01:50.185 --> 01:52.262
I'll play catch
with them right now.

01:53.355 --> 01:53.897
Good catch!

01:54.022 --> 01:55.833
She don't want
to date no drink cup!

01:55.958 --> 01:58.001
She will when
she gets to know me.

01:58.126 --> 02:01.772
I'm deep, I'm successful, and
I'm a tornado in the sack.

02:01.897 --> 02:03.540
Guys. Guys, please.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.677
I'll be happy to go
out with both of you.

02:06.802 --> 02:09.580
Unfortunately, I don't
have a babysitter.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.882
You want me
to do what to who now?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.250
It's a paying gig!

02:13.375 --> 02:14.618
Now you're complaining?

02:14.743 --> 02:16.019
Fine. I'll get somebody else.

02:16.144 --> 02:18.021
Fine. You do that.

02:18.146 --> 02:19.056
Okay, fine.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.057
You called my bluff.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.960
But that is the last time that
will ever happen, or Santa claus

02:23.085 --> 02:24.962
will burn all your toys.

02:25.087 --> 02:26.964
You're bluffing.

02:27.089 --> 02:28.031
You ain't bluffing.

02:28.156 --> 02:29.666
Santa claus will burn my toys!

02:29.791 --> 02:30.901
What can I do?

02:31.026 --> 02:33.971
Far away in the north pole, Santa
is just clicking a lighter

02:34.096 --> 02:35.172
to his gas-soaked toys.

02:35.297 --> 02:36.773
C-call the elves.

02:36.898 --> 02:37.708
The elves know.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.643
Th... they know I did good down here!

02:39.768 --> 02:40.777
Not good enough.

02:40.902 --> 02:43.847
Not until you make this right with
both me and with father Christmas.

02:43.972 --> 02:45.582
Make what right, shake?

02:45.707 --> 02:46.617
Oh, hey, man!

02:46.742 --> 02:47.618
Give me five, up top!

02:47.743 --> 02:49.586
I can see the
hand buzzer, man.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.088
You told him, you Judas!

02:51.213 --> 02:53.557
Hey, frylock, I'm
babysitting tonight, or

02:53.682 --> 02:55.525
Santa claus is gonna
burn all my toys down.

02:55.650 --> 02:58.128
Meatwad, Santa claus
would never burn all your toys,

02:58.253 --> 02:59.796
because Santa claus doesn't exist.

02:59.921 --> 03:00.697
He what?!

03:00.822 --> 03:03.533
Then how do you explain
all the cookies he eats, huh?

03:03.658 --> 03:04.167
Yeah!

03:04.292 --> 03:05.135
How you explain that?

03:05.260 --> 03:09.239
Well, I ... I haven't figured
out how the cookies disappear, okay?

03:09.364 --> 03:12.042
Then don't pop off about
things you don't even know about.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.211
I thought I was
gonna have to call 911.

03:14.336 --> 03:16.647
And we don't
have a phone, do we?

03:16.772 --> 03:18.815
Do we, out-of-work scientist?

03:18.940 --> 03:21.084
You need to have them bathed
and in their p.J.S by 7:00.

03:21.209 --> 03:21.919
Okay.

03:22.044 --> 03:24.655
Make sure you brush their teeth
and read their favorite book.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.589
They'll pick them out.

03:25.714 --> 03:26.189
They love books.

03:26.314 --> 03:27.157
And brush her hair out.

03:27.282 --> 03:27.925
It gets tangled.

03:28.050 --> 03:29.126
Okay. I'll do that.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.995
And they can watch tv, but only a
half an hour and only cartoons.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.764
So that means <i>no</i>
<i>cartoon network.</i>

03:33.889 --> 03:34.965
<i>And I should be back by 11:00.</i>

03:35.090 --> 03:35.966
<i>All right.</i>

03:36.091 --> 03:37.134
<i>Everybody, get your shoes on.</i>

03:37.259 --> 03:39.736
<i>We're gonna go to dinner and a
movie with these people that</i>

03:39.861 --> 03:40.704
<i>we've been talking to.</i>

03:40.829 --> 03:42.039
<i>No, you dumbass!</i>

03:42.164 --> 03:44.574
<i>I mean ... I mean "dumb heinie."</i>

03:44.699 --> 03:47.010
<i>Did you not just hear all those...
Things you need to do?</i>

03:47.135 --> 03:48.545
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

03:48.670 --> 03:49.012
<i>Backtrack.</i>

03:49.137 --> 03:52.282
<i>You said something about
returning at 11:00, but the way</i>

03:52.407 --> 03:56.520
<i>I had it worked out in my mind,
that's about the time when I got</i>

03:56.645 --> 04:00.157
<i>both of my hands deep in your
bra, kneading your chest like</i>

04:00.282 --> 04:00.757
<i>pizza dough.</i>

04:00.882 --> 04:02.759
<i>Uh, she's sleeping
with me tonight, Carl.</i>

04:02.884 --> 04:03.660
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

04:03.785 --> 04:04.761
<i>On the floor in the hallway?</i>

04:04.886 --> 04:05.495
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:05.620 --> 04:06.897
<i>Away from the puddles
of his urine.</i>

04:07.022 --> 04:07.965
<i>I don't do that.</i>

04:08.090 --> 04:09.099
<i>I know you do that.</i>

04:09.224 --> 04:10.233
<i>I do it sometimes.</i>

04:10.358 --> 04:11.068
<i>>> Don't leave, mommy!</i>

04:11.193 --> 04:11.668
<i>>> Don't go.</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:12.703
<i>I don't like this babysitter!</i>

04:12.828 --> 04:14.738
<i>Get the...
Out of my way or I'm gonna put a hole in</i>

04:14.863 --> 04:16.707
<i>you so big ... I'm sorry.</i>

04:16.832 --> 04:17.641
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:17.766 --> 04:21.611
<i>I'm just a little excited about
the big night ahead of us.</i>

04:21.736 --> 04:22.779
<i>Let's take my car.</i>

04:22.904 --> 04:24.915
<i>Hey, Carl, can I
borrow your car?</i>

04:25.040 --> 04:26.750
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

04:26.875 --> 04:28.018
<i>We're driving my car.</i>

04:28.143 --> 04:29.886
<i>But there's only room for two.</i>

04:30.011 --> 04:33.056
<i>So someone may have to
ride in the trunk.</i>

04:33.181 --> 04:33.857
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:34.891
<i>And that's you, right?</i>

04:35.016 --> 04:35.926
<i>I mean, it's our date.</i>

04:36.051 --> 04:37.227
<i>It's gonna be you, cup.</i>

04:37.352 --> 04:38.061
<i>Fine.</i>

04:38.186 --> 04:38.895
<i>What about this?</i>

04:39.020 --> 04:40.931
<i>Would you possibly mind
riding in the trunk?</i>

04:41.056 --> 04:41.865
<i>Shake! Hey!</i>

04:41.990 --> 04:44.001
<i>Just until we
get to the hoagie shop.</i>

04:44.126 --> 04:44.735
<i>Hey!</i>

04:44.860 --> 04:46.670
<i>I ain't having my date
ride in the trunk!</i>

04:46.795 --> 04:47.871
<i>Unless she wants to.</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:50.173
<i>There is a lot of leg
room back there.</i>

04:50.298 --> 04:53.543
<i>You know, once you take out
the spare and the subwoofer.</i>

04:53.668 --> 04:55.212
<i>You think about it.</i>

04:55.337 --> 04:57.280
<i>But we are at the curb now.</i>

04:57.405 --> 04:58.749
<i>Hmm.</i>

04:58.874 --> 05:02.085
<i>I'm gonna stay in here
for five more minutes.</i>

05:02.210 --> 05:06.690
<i>And I need to conduct a space
battle in here, but after that,</i>

05:06.815 --> 05:07.824
<i>it's bedtime.</i>

05:09.084 --> 05:10.794
<i>You know, I ain't
playing around.</i>

05:10.919 --> 05:14.731
<i>I am playing around, yes, with
space toys, but I'm not playing</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:16.833
<i>around when it comes to bedtime.</i>

05:16.958 --> 05:18.668
<i>>> We're not her children.</i>

05:18.793 --> 05:20.003
<i>>> We're bodyguards.</i>

05:20.128 --> 05:24.875
<i>>> In an intergalactic
witness protection program.</i>

05:25.000 --> 05:28.578
<i>And that mommy... ...
Is actually in our custody.</i>

05:28.703 --> 05:31.648
<i>And I'm the king
wookie, and this here's my</i>

05:31.773 --> 05:32.482
<i>bubble gun.</i>

05:33.909 --> 05:36.586
<i>>> You think I'm
Around with you, huh?</i>

05:36.711 --> 05:40.023
<i>It's okay, sweetie,
'cause your mama, she's in very</i>

05:40.148 --> 05:40.891
<i>good hands.</i>

05:41.016 --> 05:41.691
<i>Aah!</i>

05:41.816 --> 05:44.227
<i>Can't believe you forgot to
bring the freaking coupon!</i>

05:44.352 --> 05:47.130
<i>I don't cut things
out just 'cause you say so!</i>

05:47.255 --> 05:48.131
<i>>> 47, food's up.</i>

05:48.256 --> 05:50.167
<i>Besides,
our food's here!</i>

05:50.292 --> 05:52.702
<i>Where's our date?</i>

05:52.827 --> 05:53.603
<i>Wow.</i>

05:53.728 --> 05:58.241
<i>This is embarrassing, but
can we borrow $15.92?</i>

05:58.366 --> 06:00.644
<i>Well, I got chips, too.</i>

06:00.769 --> 06:02.913
<i>So we need money for those, too.</i>

06:03.038 --> 06:07.784
<i>But, uh, I'll pay you back later
with my world-famous chest</i>

06:07.909 --> 06:08.718
<i>massage.</i>

06:10.712 --> 06:11.521
<i>You hear me?</i>

06:11.646 --> 06:12.055
<i>Wake up.</i>

06:12.180 --> 06:13.657
<i>Hey, wake up.</i>

06:13.782 --> 06:14.991
<i>Wake up!</i>

06:15.116 --> 06:16.026
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

06:16.151 --> 06:17.194
<i>Poke holes in the trunk.</i>

06:17.319 --> 06:19.496
<i>Dig around in her
purse there for a $20.</i>

06:19.621 --> 06:21.932
<i>I mean, those guys are still waiting
at the cash register for us.</i>

06:22.057 --> 06:22.799
<i>You do it.</i>

06:22.924 --> 06:23.934
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

06:24.059 --> 06:24.801
<i>What are you doing?</i>

06:24.926 --> 06:25.702
<i>Rose petals.</i>

06:25.827 --> 06:27.838
<i>I'm building a little bridge to...
Town.</i>

06:27.963 --> 06:29.206
<i>All right, look.</i>

06:29.331 --> 06:31.508
<i>I got diarrhea, bad.</i>

06:31.633 --> 06:36.780
<i>But you don't make no seduction
moves with my date while I'm</i>

06:36.905 --> 06:37.547
<i>gone.</i>

06:37.672 --> 06:39.149
<i>I got my eye on you.</i>

06:41.243 --> 06:42.786
<i>Wake up, my lady.</i>

06:42.911 --> 06:46.089
<i>Mightn't I help you out of your
chariot so you might have the</i>

06:46.214 --> 06:49.226
<i>pleasure of watching me shove
this steak knife into this</i>

06:49.351 --> 06:50.227
<i>jackass' tire?</i>

06:53.722 --> 06:55.098
<i>I'll get it. Hold on.</i>

07:00.262 --> 07:03.874
<i>We vaporize her,
and those parking tickets</i>

07:03.999 --> 07:04.774
<i>disappear.</i>

07:04.899 --> 07:05.942
<i>Okay, man.</i>

07:06.067 --> 07:06.576
<i>>> Come on.</i>

07:06.701 --> 07:08.078
<i>>> We
need to go get her.</i>

07:08.203 --> 07:10.847
<i>Okay, but remember,
now, we all need to brush our</i>

07:10.972 --> 07:11.615
<i>teeth first.</i>

07:11.740 --> 07:14.651
<i>>> We'll be brushing our teeth
with your blood if we don't get</i>

07:14.776 --> 07:15.585
<i>out of here now.</i>

07:15.710 --> 07:16.453
<i>No.</i>

07:16.578 --> 07:19.456
<i>Your mama said that y'all need
to read me some books and comb</i>

07:19.581 --> 07:22.092
<i>my hair to keep it tangled,
'cause I'm supposed to be in bed</i>

07:22.217 --> 07:22.826
<i>by 8:00.</i>

07:22.951 --> 07:24.561
<i>>> You're the worst</i>

07:24.686 --> 07:25.929
<i>Babysitter we ever had!</i>

07:26.054 --> 07:27.464
<i>>> Heinie rockets, go!</i>

07:28.723 --> 07:30.634
<i>See you later, then.</i>

07:30.759 --> 07:31.568
<i>I mean ... wait.</i>

07:31.693 --> 07:33.570
<i>Can I stay up and watch some tv?</i>

07:33.695 --> 07:37.607
<i>Look, I'm laying all
my cards on the table here.</i>

07:37.732 --> 07:41.578
<i>I want us to have an honest
relationship right off the bat.</i>

07:41.703 --> 07:44.781
<i>I couldn't help but notice
that you got kids.</i>

07:44.906 --> 07:46.049
<i>How tight are you?</i>

07:46.174 --> 07:49.085
<i>Carl, that is
inappropriate, as is the</i>

07:49.210 --> 07:51.188
<i>diarrhea on the back
of your shirt.</i>

07:51.313 --> 07:52.989
<i>I ... I must apologize.</i>

07:53.114 --> 07:56.660
<i>It was like I sat down on a
flamethrower back there, you know?</i>

07:56.785 --> 07:57.594
<i>You can relate.</i>

07:57.719 --> 07:59.896
<i>And you need to stock
your bathroom better!</i>

08:00.021 --> 08:02.966
<i>I had to run out here with my
pants around my ankles and grab</i>

08:03.091 --> 08:04.134
<i>some napkins!</i>

08:04.259 --> 08:05.669
<i>>> Oh, my God.</i>

08:06.961 --> 08:07.837
<i>It's them.</i>

08:09.064 --> 08:12.742
<i>There's my parking
space right there, on top of</i>

08:12.867 --> 08:15.545
<i>that other vehicle
in a parking space.</i>

08:15.670 --> 08:17.881
<i>We park anywhere we want.</i>

08:18.006 --> 08:19.816
<i>I'm handicapped, man!</i>

08:19.941 --> 08:21.017
<i>'Cause I'm drunk.</i>

08:22.010 --> 08:26.089
<i>And you can't do
one single thing about it.</i>

08:28.950 --> 08:31.795
<i>Man, you told that pig
off and that bitch and that</i>

08:31.920 --> 08:34.130
<i>judge and that guy in the
jail that raped you!</i>

08:34.255 --> 08:37.701
<i>They all know where
to go and how to eat it now.</i>

08:37.826 --> 08:41.171
<i>I've told them where their
dinner is and what it is.</i>

08:41.296 --> 08:43.106
<i>>> I testified against them.</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:45.208
<i>Witness Protection sent me here.</i>

08:45.333 --> 08:47.143
<i>And we followed you!</i>

08:47.268 --> 08:48.912
<i>Hurry, err.</i>

08:49.037 --> 08:49.813
<i>Vaporize him.</i>

08:49.938 --> 08:53.183
<i>I told you, man, this is
as freaking fast as it goes.</i>

08:53.308 --> 08:54.484
<i>It is a vaporizer.</i>

08:54.609 --> 08:55.485
<i>Hey!</i>

08:55.610 --> 08:58.154
<i>I'm having an intimate,
romantic evening over here.</i>

08:58.279 --> 09:00.857
<i>So you pipe it down or
I'll pipe down your face!</i>

09:00.982 --> 09:04.027
<i>How about an
appetizer ... one fresh bird, fat</i>

09:04.152 --> 09:05.195
<i>boy, straight up.</i>

09:05.320 --> 09:07.831
<i>Hey, y'all, I've
come here to tell u that I put</i>

09:07.956 --> 09:10.166
<i>your kids to bed at 8:00,
just like you said.</i>

09:10.291 --> 09:11.434
<i>>> You left them at home?</i>

09:11.559 --> 09:12.202
<i>Well, no.</i>

09:12.327 --> 09:12.969
<i>Of course not.</i>

09:13.094 --> 09:13.870
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

09:13.995 --> 09:14.904
<i>I let them come with me.</i>

09:15.029 --> 09:15.839
<i>>> Hey, mommy.</i>

09:15.964 --> 09:16.706
<i>>> Hey, mom.</i>

09:16.831 --> 09:19.976
<i>I'm just telling you
a lie so I don't get in no</i>

09:20.101 --> 09:20.677
<i>trouble.</i>

09:20.802 --> 09:22.212
<i>>> Set heinie lasers to kill.</i>

09:26.341 --> 09:28.084
<i>>> Okay. We should go.</i>

09:28.209 --> 09:30.086
<i>Well, I've had a really
nice time tonight.</i>

09:30.211 --> 09:32.856
<i>So which one of you
pushed a steak knife through my</i>

09:32.981 --> 09:33.690
<i>back tire, huh?</i>

09:33.815 --> 09:34.758
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:34.883 --> 09:36.760
<i>I guess you'd better
go take care of that.</i>

09:36.885 --> 09:40.864
<i>Me and my lady are taking the
bus to bangville, a.K.A. The</i>

09:40.989 --> 09:44.501
<i>hot, rashy astroturf
in my rented flat.</i>

09:44.626 --> 09:46.236
<i>He don't
care about you!</i>

09:46.361 --> 09:49.472
<i>I'm the one that loves you
and imagines you riding me!</i>

09:49.597 --> 09:53.009
<i>>> I wish I could stay with
both of you, but I'm sorry.</i>

09:53.134 --> 09:56.546
<i>The truth is, I'm molting
for the next three days.</i>

09:56.671 --> 10:02.585
<i>Plus, my vagina would destroy
you, and I sweat acid.</i>

10:05.079 --> 10:07.557
<i>What did you say
to her to make her leave?</i>

10:07.682 --> 10:08.625
<i>I don't know.</i>

10:08.750 --> 10:11.661
<i>I stopped paying attention,
like, two hours ago.</i>

10:11.786 --> 10:14.264
<i>All I heard was, "blah,
blah, blah, period.</i>

10:14.389 --> 10:15.665
<i>I'm on my period."</i>

10:15.790 --> 10:18.601
<i>Just on and on
and on and gababababa!</i>

10:18.726 --> 10:20.003
<i>Blip blop blippity doo!</i>

10:20.128 --> 10:20.804
<i>God.</i>

10:20.929 --> 10:23.606
<i>I try to say one lie about myself
and my fake achievements,</i>

10:23.731 --> 10:25.275
<i>and it's like I'm
talking to a wall.</i>

10:25.400 --> 10:26.843
<i>They're all like that.</i>

10:26.968 --> 10:30.080
<i>They're all like, "now that
dinner's paid for, I got to go.</i>

10:30.205 --> 10:34.284
<i>My shell has broken open, and now
I got to go to another galaxy."</i>

10:34.409 --> 10:36.820
<i>Freaking molting bitches.</i>

10:42.283 --> 10:45.729
<i>Look, I'm sorry I let
some stupid broad get in between</i>

10:45.854 --> 10:48.298
<i>you and me and us both
getting some with her.</i>

10:48.423 --> 10:49.666
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

10:49.791 --> 10:54.704
<i>I'm gonna go inside, fire up the
computer, and rub one out.</i>

10:54.829 --> 10:59.576
<i>Pop a coldie and then rub a
second smaller one out.</i>

10:59.701 --> 11:00.677
<i>If I have enough.</i>

11:00.802 --> 11:02.145
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

11:03.371 --> 11:06.116
<i>How would one go about
doing that, exactly?</i>

11:06.241 --> 11:07.517
<i>I mean, I know.</i>

11:08.376 --> 11:12.011
<i>Ah, it's just a friend of mine was...
Curious.</i>
