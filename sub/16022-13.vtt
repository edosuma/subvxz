00:03.436 --> 00:06.105
(music plays in distance)

00:06.107 --> 00:08.173
(static crackling over
indistinct voices)

00:12.312 --> 00:14.380
(indistinct chatter;
static crackling)

00:15.782 --> 00:17.516
Man (staticky): Can I get a cup
of coffee from...

00:17.518 --> 00:18.751
(man continues, voice garbled,
mixed with other voices)

00:18.753 --> 00:24.189
Man: I'd like a tall latte
with, uh, two shots... (static)

00:25.225 --> 00:27.059
Coming right up.
Thanks.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.529
Would you like anything
to eat, sir?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.032
No, thank you.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.401
That'll be three
dollars, please.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.137
Um, look, I don't suppose you
could, uh, break a 50?

00:38.139 --> 00:40.239
For a three-dollar latte?

00:40.241 --> 00:41.673
Well, it's all I have.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.709
All right.
(clears throat)

00:43.711 --> 00:45.344
Thank you;
thank you so much.

00:49.682 --> 00:52.584
Mr. Merchiston?

00:52.586 --> 00:55.320
Keep walking.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.423
Who are you?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.291
A friend of suvari.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.459
Where is suvari?

01:00.461 --> 01:01.827
Not here, but I am.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.096
Right. And what
assurance do I have

01:04.098 --> 01:06.799
That this man suvari
is actually real?

01:06.801 --> 01:10.602
How does suvari really know
that you're a reporter?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.405
And not an agency asset?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.773
Well, in the interest
of full disclosure,

01:14.775 --> 01:16.675
I've yet to be mistaken
for james bond.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.510
(laughs)

01:18.512 --> 01:20.345
Aw.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.549
(surveillance camera whirring)

01:24.651 --> 01:26.452
Suvari will be in touch.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.841
(alarm chirps)

01:50.810 --> 01:53.178
(engine growling)

01:56.449 --> 01:59.284
(engine roars, tires screech)

02:04.157 --> 02:05.791
(engine roars)

02:05.793 --> 02:07.893
(siren starts up,
tires screech)

02:09.462 --> 02:11.563
Officer (over radio):
Control, this is 3-david-34.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.898
Reporting a possible 425-baker.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.600
In pursuit of a silver camaro.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.336
License adam-king-sam-henry,
413.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.172
Vehicle's traveling southbound
on rialto ridge

02:20.174 --> 02:20.906
At high rate of speed.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.275
(siren wailing)

02:23.277 --> 02:24.710
Backup units, be advised.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.578
Suspect vehicle has turned
onto wilmington.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.646
(tires screech, siren wails)

02:33.553 --> 02:35.387
He's heading for the strip.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.890
Officer:
Control, this guy's not
stopping.

02:37.892 --> 02:40.592
We need to bring him down
before he hurts somebody.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.597
Officer:
He's crossing lanes!

02:46.533 --> 02:48.200
Oh, my god!

02:48.202 --> 02:51.203
Control:
All units, fire and paramedics

02:51.205 --> 02:53.272
Are en route to your location.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.241
Thank you.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.277
Yeager?!
What are you doing here?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.778
Oh, I'm pulling
double shifts this week.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.914
Need the hours,
so you're stuck with me.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.583
So, our driver raced
through the intersection,

03:04.585 --> 03:07.286
Lost control,
hit this lamp pole,

03:07.288 --> 03:08.787
And spun out over there.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.556
The vehicle's registered
to zenith car rentals.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.191
Office will be
open in a hour.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.458
We'll get
the renter's name then.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.960
Think I have an I.D.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.265
Passport.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.704
Finn...
Check this out.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.383
It's john merchiston.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.952
The reporter?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.486
Yeah.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.322
I don't understand.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.823
Why would he run from the lvpd?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.592
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.960
Well, if this guy's a reporter,

03:47.962 --> 03:49.895
Maybe there's more to the story.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.409
â™ª who... Are you?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.512
â™ª who, who, who, who?

04:07.514 --> 04:10.515
â™ª who... Are you?

04:10.517 --> 04:11.883
â™ª who, who, who, who?

04:11.885 --> 04:14.419
â™ª I really wanna know

04:14.421 --> 04:16.788
â™ª who... Are you?

04:16.790 --> 04:18.690
â™ª oh-oh-oh
â™ª <i>who...</i> â™ª

04:18.692 --> 04:22.361
â™ª come on, tell me who are you,
you, you â™ª

04:22.363 --> 04:25.464
â™ª are you!

04:51.057 --> 04:54.426
Merchiston:
<i>That voice inside your head.</i>

04:54.428 --> 04:56.862
The day that it does go quiet.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.863
Do you think that

04:57.865 --> 04:59.631
That will bring you peace?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.767
<i>Or will it be a loss</i>
<i>too great to bear?</i>

05:05.004 --> 05:08.407
Merchiston and I spent
a lot of time together.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.475
I suppose he got
to know me a little bit.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.711
But I don't, I don't know
anything about him.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.413
I don't know
if he had a family...

05:14.415 --> 05:15.814
He doesn't have any family.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.619
Well, hell.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.454
All right.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.722
What do we know?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.424
On the face of it,
it looks like an accident.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.427
What's that supposed to mean--
"on the face of it"?

05:28.429 --> 05:29.528
Well, look at the vehicle.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.796
There's nothing left of it.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.065
I mean, the engine is
all the way over there.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.734
Have you ever seen
a car accident like this?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.069
Yeah, sadly, I have.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.870
Alcohol, drugs, a lead foot.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.539
I see it all the time.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.840
Yeah, well, john didn't drink

05:41.842 --> 05:43.408
And he didn't do drugs.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.444
He had been sober
for over two years.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.647
Is there something
you should be telling me?

05:48.649 --> 05:51.083
John was working on a story.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.051
Something to do
with the government

05:53.053 --> 05:54.820
And domestic spying.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.655
He told me
that he was being followed.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.457
I, of course, thought
that he was paranoid.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.892
Wait, wait a minute.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.960
When did this happen?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.061
Well, a couple of months ago.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.663
I-I had, uh, you know...

06:04.665 --> 06:05.630
We stayed in touch.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.367
You'd stayed in touch.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.635
Yes, we stayed in touch.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.903
I'm listening.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.740
The extent
of the damage to the car,

06:14.742 --> 06:17.709
The behavior of a man who had no
reason to run from the police,

06:17.711 --> 06:21.380
And yet, was obviously running
from something.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.514
So you think this was murder?

06:22.516 --> 06:24.616
That john was targeted?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.818
I think he was being silenced
for something that he knew.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.987
Somebody puts a bomb
in the car?

06:28.989 --> 06:31.656
Detonates it during a
high-speed police chase?

06:31.658 --> 06:33.725
Is that what you think?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.793
That's way out there, jules.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.994
You don't believe

06:35.996 --> 06:37.562
That there are
parts of government

06:37.564 --> 06:39.464
That would go
to extreme measures

06:39.466 --> 06:40.999
To silence someone?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.634
What I believe in is evidence.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.669
And so should you
if you're thinking

06:44.671 --> 06:47.139
About accusing
somebody in authority.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.108
Brody:
Based on this video footage,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.177
I can't tell
if finn's theory is correct,

06:52.179 --> 06:53.979
And the car exploded
before hitting the light pole.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.648
Or if it happened on impact.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.718
Here's the rest of the traffic
cam footage from the chase.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.686
Merchiston ran the red light

07:01.688 --> 07:04.089
At sahara and rialto ridge
already doing 90.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.991
Let's see where
this chase began.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.760
(beeping)

07:10.430 --> 07:12.097
Garage at the
embarcadero?

07:12.099 --> 07:14.032
Man, he came flying
out of there.
Hmm.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.835
And that is

07:16.837 --> 07:19.004
The best angle from the street
of the embarcadero we have.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.673
We might be able to track him
moving through the mall.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.608
Let's see.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.877
Hello.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.112
Who's the mystery woman?

07:27.114 --> 07:30.615
But it looks like
she handed him something.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.683
And the way the
light's hitting it,

07:31.685 --> 07:32.818
It looks metallic.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.119
Maybe a key?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.687
Merchiston was
a journalist.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.156
I'm thinking
that that was a flash drive.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.625
We didn't find a flash drive
at the scene.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.861
Though I doubt it would have
survived that explosion.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.063
Brody: You know, she was
the last person to see

07:45.065 --> 07:47.032
Merchiston alive.
We need to find her.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.800
Woman:
<i>So, mr. Merchiston,</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:52.871
You go from rock journalist
to quixotic muckraker.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.540
I'd have to say
I'm just a seeker of the truth.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.709
And if that makes
certain people uncomfortable,

07:57.711 --> 07:59.544
Then maybe they need
to be uncomfortable.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.812
'cause I would say that

08:00.814 --> 08:03.915
In our obsession with security,

08:03.917 --> 08:06.685
We may be relinquishing
our freedom.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.921
Surrendering
to the real enemy-- fear.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.891
Finished my autopsy
on mr. Merchiston.

08:12.893 --> 08:16.795
"c.O.D.: Massive
blunt force trauma

08:16.797 --> 08:18.730
Consistent with
high speed impact."

08:18.732 --> 08:21.733
If it's any consolation, death
would've been mercifully quick--

08:21.735 --> 08:24.102
Long before
the fire consumed the vehicle.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.571
Tox report shows
high levels of cocaine,

08:26.573 --> 08:28.907
And a blood alcohol level
of .19.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.076
And in that condition,
I'm not surprised

08:31.078 --> 08:32.878
He didn't want
to get pulled over.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.280
It says here you're going
to rule it an accident.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.917
He should never
have been behind the wheel.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.093
(lift whirring)

08:48.095 --> 08:50.562
â™ª

09:02.174 --> 09:03.208
(whirring)

09:04.110 --> 09:05.777
(camera shutter clicking)

09:09.081 --> 09:11.082
Finlay:
I got your text.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.551
You find something?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.619
Yeah, something
I've never seen before.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.755
At first, I thought
this was some kind

09:16.757 --> 09:17.889
Of triggering device.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.559
It's a black box,
like on a plane.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.827
It was installed after-market
by the rental car company.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.730
It's wi-fi. They use it
to monitor all their vehicles--

09:25.732 --> 09:27.666
Location, speed...

09:27.668 --> 09:29.634
All right, so, it's
not part of a bomb,

09:29.636 --> 09:31.269
But it is a black box,

09:31.271 --> 09:33.138
So, maybe
there's some information in it

09:33.140 --> 09:36.107
That would suggest
that there was a bomb.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.611
Possible. Here is the file
of the car's last trip.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.113
Merchiston floored it
down rialto ridge.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.283
He made a left turn,
then crashed.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.886
These vitals and
the gps indicate

09:47.888 --> 09:49.921
A single catastrophic event

09:49.923 --> 09:52.857
Occurring at the coordinates
where the car hit the pole.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.928
So, your explosion
happened upon contact.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.797
Well, that doesn't
rule out a bomb.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.131
Well, it doesn't
support it, either.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.266
This might.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.834
I found unusually
high levels

10:02.836 --> 10:04.069
Of aluminum, magnesium,

10:04.071 --> 10:05.937
Silicon and iron oxide
in the wreckage.

10:05.939 --> 10:10.041
All are consistent with
a thermite explosion.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.177
Well, that would explain
the intensity of the blast

10:12.179 --> 10:17.782
But... We are talking
about a car exploding

10:17.784 --> 10:19.217
Upon impact with a light pole.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.620
And the metals present in

10:21.622 --> 10:23.888
Thermite are also found
in laptops,

10:23.890 --> 10:25.357
Cell phones, tablets.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.892
I know that you're looking
for a different answer,

10:27.894 --> 10:30.895
But I think that we need to find
something more definitive.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.632
(phone rings)

10:33.634 --> 10:35.800
John's attorney is here,

10:35.802 --> 10:38.103
And she wants us
to release his body.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.305
I don't understand.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.773
I thought the circumstances

10:41.775 --> 10:43.241
Of john's accident
were pretty clear-cut.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.745
Well, we still have a...
Few questions,

10:46.747 --> 10:48.980
Ms. Mcdermott, and we thought
maybe you could, uh...

10:48.982 --> 10:51.016
You could help us.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.884
Questions like what?

10:52.886 --> 10:56.655
Uh, like, what was the story
that john was working on

10:56.657 --> 10:59.124
Which brought him here to vegas
in the last few months?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.693
John.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.795
So it's you.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.063
(exhales)

11:05.065 --> 11:08.099
John always had
a weakness for blondes.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.436
Your client is dead.

11:11.438 --> 11:15.073
Any information you have
might help us close this case.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.741
So do me a favor,
will you?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.877
Do you, do you recognize
this woman?

11:20.913 --> 11:22.013
No. Why?

11:22.015 --> 11:22.981
Finlay:
She was the last person

11:22.983 --> 11:24.949
To see john alive.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.686
We think that she
passed him some information.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.087
I've never seen her before.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.322
All I know is
john was working

11:31.324 --> 11:32.957
On an investigative piece.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.192
Something to do with
computer hacking

11:34.194 --> 11:36.394
And domestic
intelligence gathering.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.730
So, spying on u.S. Citizens.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.799
Mcdermott:
Allegedly.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.168
The point person
is an air force general,

11:43.170 --> 11:45.236
Robert lansdale,
out of nellis.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.005
Nellis.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.106
That would help explain

11:48.108 --> 11:49.374
All the trips to vegas.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.842
Yeah, and why his accident

11:50.844 --> 11:52.277
May not have been an accident.

11:52.279 --> 11:56.948
I know john had a gift
for telling a good tale.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.050
Seducing his listener.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.821
But the truth is,
his story was going nowhere.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.122
He was frustrated.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.024
So you think
it   <i>wa</i>an accident?

12:06.026 --> 12:08.026
I do.
Well, you must
have known

12:08.028 --> 12:09.794
That he had enemies.
Yes.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.296
But, also, <i>you</i> must know

12:11.298 --> 12:15.033
That john's own worst enemy
was always himself.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.838
Yeager, it's russell.
Where are we

12:19.840 --> 12:22.340
On the security footage
from the embarcadero?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.143
Well-well then,
go to another judge.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.277
We need those tapes.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.480
I want eyes on merchiston

12:28.482 --> 12:31.950
And this mystery woman,
wherever they went, okay?

12:31.952 --> 12:34.085
Call me back.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.089
(car engine starts)

12:43.863 --> 12:44.996
(grunts)

12:44.998 --> 12:47.098
Oh!

12:48.768 --> 12:50.201
John?

12:51.837 --> 12:53.304
What the hell are you doing?
We thought you were

12:53.306 --> 12:55.106
...Dead.
Dead.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.175
Yeah, I know.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.043
We don't have much time.
I can't stay here.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.545
Where's your car?

13:00.547 --> 13:03.181
Where is your car?
We need to get out of here, now.

13:09.489 --> 13:14.559
I wish I bloody knew.
You know a lot more than I do.
Start... Come here.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.161
Whose body is in our morgue?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.896
Oh, it's brian.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.165
Brian freeman,
he's my assistant.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.466
He was driving my car.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.335
I gave him my coat and my hat.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.337
He took his place
behind the wheel of my car

13:26.339 --> 13:29.474
And we both know
what happened after that.
No, no.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.209
We identified the body using
your dental records.

13:31.211 --> 13:35.180
Same way you got a tox report
claiming that I was high.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.447
And drunk.
Don't play games with me!

13:36.449 --> 13:38.850
Talk to me!
I'm not playing games with you!

13:38.852 --> 13:40.385
(whispers):
I'm covering a story.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.987
I know.
About domestic spying, right?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.889
So you know
it's of a sensitive nature,

13:44.891 --> 13:47.325
Involving powerful people.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.594
People capable of hacking
into a crime lab computer,

13:49.596 --> 13:52.363
Fabricating
a toxicology report

13:52.365 --> 13:53.865
Labeling me
a drunk driver.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.867
What about the dental records?

13:55.869 --> 13:58.570
Well, they've got their hackers,
and I've got mine.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.872
I-I need your help, db.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.241
John, I'm just
a local cop.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.409
If what you're
saying is true,

14:04.411 --> 14:08.179
You need to talk to a
friend of mine at the fbi.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.348
Fbi? You're joking, are you?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.917
That's the last place
I'm going is the fbi.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.187
You are hardly a local cop.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.190
In fact,
you and your team--

14:19.192 --> 14:21.526
You're literally
the only ones who can help me.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.497
Please, db.

14:26.499 --> 14:30.001
The people who are trying
to kill me, the people who...

14:30.003 --> 14:31.636
Killed brian.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.138
When they find out
their mistake...

14:34.140 --> 14:35.940
They <i>will</i> try again.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.109
I just need to lay low
for a while.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.045
Until I can figure out
what the hell's on this.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.184
I heard you got your hands
on the security cam footage

14:46.186 --> 14:47.652
From the embarcadero mall.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.120
Yeah, yeah, I'm going
through it right now.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.589
Well, how the hell
did you pull that off?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.057
'cause I've been on the
phone for three hours

14:53.059 --> 14:54.325
With four different judges,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.160
And I couldn't even
get close to a warrant.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.962
Yeager, sometimes you
have to know who to ask

14:57.964 --> 14:59.230
And know how to ask 'em.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.033
There was a very lovely,
nice young woman

15:02.035 --> 15:03.601
Working at
embarcadero operations

15:03.603 --> 15:07.372
Who was more than happy
to give me a hand.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.206
Well, I'm impressed.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.207
Thank you.
Yeah.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.076
Here she makes
the drop-off,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.012
And then she just kind of
heads off through the crowd.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.480
What's behind
the corner, there?

15:18.117 --> 15:20.952
Look at the reflection.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.288
Let's see if I can
get a taxi number.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.490
I'm impressed again.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.993
"t312x."

15:28.995 --> 15:31.663
Call the company, see where
the cabbie dropped her off.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.533
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

15:37.703 --> 15:39.170
I can't believe it.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.574
I'm sorry,
I-I had nowhere else to go.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.143
All right, come on in.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.280
Let's start at the beginning,

15:49.282 --> 15:54.185
Who gave it to you.
Like I told you, I'm working
on a story right now.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.987
Uh, I have an inside man.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.689
He's providing
me with information
on project jericho,

15:57.691 --> 16:00.425
Which is a domestic
spying program.

16:00.427 --> 16:06.531
So the woman was your contact?
I don't know who the woman is.
I've never met her before.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.001
You see, in the past, suvari
just arranged a dead drop.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.203
He'd leave a flash drive
somewhere and I'd find it.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.105
But not this time.
No, no.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.374
This time I told him I actually
need to look him in the eye.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.576
Before I publish my story,
I need to be assured

16:18.578 --> 16:20.078
That the information
that he's providing

16:20.080 --> 16:21.679
On project jericho is genuine.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.182
Specifically, about the man
who's-who's running things.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.616
Who's some air force general.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.118
Robert lansdale.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.555
How did you...?
Oh, that's all
right, go on.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.690
Right. Well, amongst
other things right now,

16:32.692 --> 16:35.293
They're using drones
for domestic surveillance.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.061
Question is:
Who are they watching?

16:37.063 --> 16:38.363
And who's watching the watchmen?

16:38.365 --> 16:41.032
Precisely. Um...

16:41.034 --> 16:45.136
I was told that the information
off this flash drive would make

16:45.138 --> 16:47.005
Snowden's leaks look like
a minor blip on the radar.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.374
I'm assuming that
the files are encrypted.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.777
I had the decryption key
on my laptop.

16:52.779 --> 16:53.778
That was in my car.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.246
Which is where we come in.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.615
Assuming that you
can crack it.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.550
The safest place
for you right now

16:59.552 --> 17:01.119
Is to stay here.
First, we need

17:01.121 --> 17:02.787
To find out what's
on this flash drive.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.789
Then we can figure out
what our next move is.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.257
Where are you going?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.559
I'm gonna go
back to the lab.
The three of us

17:08.561 --> 17:10.561
Are the only people that know
that john's still alive.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.796
Let-let's keep it that way.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.332
I'll call you when
I get something.

17:16.135 --> 17:19.170
(thunder rumbling)

17:19.172 --> 17:21.672
Yeager: <i>The cab company</i>
<i>said our mystery woman</i>

17:21.674 --> 17:25.176
Was dropped off at the
palermo last night at 11:15.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.812
Hotel has her registered
under the name emily rey.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.314
Security checked her room,
she wasn't there.

17:30.316 --> 17:34.085
An hour ago, we get
a call out here-- 419.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.822
She fits the description.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.124
Super dave, what's the word?

17:40.126 --> 17:42.527
Tod's approximately
six hours ago.

17:42.529 --> 17:46.664
And we got blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.132
Stokes:
Yeah.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.069
All this spatter,

17:51.071 --> 17:53.504
Cast-off, I'd be willing
to bet you she was hit

17:53.506 --> 17:54.839
More than a couple
of times, yeah?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.607
Definitely.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.242
Yeager: Hey, we got
more blood over here.

17:58.244 --> 18:02.080
Gravitational drops...

18:02.082 --> 18:04.449
Could've come
off the weapon.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.219
Nick...

18:09.521 --> 18:11.155
(thunder rumbling)

18:13.125 --> 18:14.525
Stokes: Oh, yeah.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.829
Got a print and blood.
And a good one, at that.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.163
Just sent the photo to the lab,

18:19.165 --> 18:20.465
They're running
a check.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.567
(phone chimes)

18:22.569 --> 18:23.801
Just got a hit.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.103
That was quick.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.337
What the hell?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.605
What's wrong?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.240
Hey, dave.
Yeah.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.509
You say the time of death
was six hours ago, right?

18:31.511 --> 18:32.877
That's right. Why?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.148
Our killer's a dead man.

18:41.353 --> 18:42.420
Greg...

18:42.422 --> 18:44.255
I got something
I need you to do.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.556
Well, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.258
Well, this takes priority.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.292
A flash drive?
(cell phone chimes)

18:48.294 --> 18:50.161
Files on it are encrypted.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.629
I need you to open
them up for me.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.664
Oh, damn it.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.699
Is everything all right?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.400
Just-just do it.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.205
We got a problem. I need to talk
to you about that merchiston

19:01.207 --> 19:03.641
Car wreck.
All right, come in,
come in.

19:04.776 --> 19:08.446
Well, there's something
just not right about it.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.181
(sighs)

19:11.483 --> 19:13.451
Tell me what you know.
Yeager and I tracked down

19:13.453 --> 19:16.454
The mystery woman, the one
that met merchiston in the mall.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.723
I'm pretty sure those two
hooked up again later.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.891
Why do you say that?

19:19.893 --> 19:24.529
Beaten to death with a crowbar,
and merchiston's fingerprints

19:24.531 --> 19:26.230
Right there
on the murder weapon.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.699
Now, she was killed
six hours ago.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.635
His car crash was 36 hours ago.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.336
I mean, you do the math.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.839
Are you absolutely positive
about the fingerprint?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.440
It's in the victim's blood.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.442
Listen, merchiston
is still alive,

19:38.444 --> 19:40.711
And he's a stone-cold killer.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.514
What's going on?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.583
(phone buzzing, shower running)

20:02.334 --> 20:03.367
(gasps)

20:03.369 --> 20:04.669
(sighs)

20:04.671 --> 20:06.437
You scared me.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.539
That wasn't my intention.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.243
John, I-I...

20:12.245 --> 20:14.278
Something happened

20:14.280 --> 20:15.947
Since the last time

20:15.949 --> 20:17.348
I saw you.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.549
What?

20:18.551 --> 20:21.485
I don't want to
talk about it.

20:33.265 --> 20:34.532
Russell left me a message.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.666
Really? What about?

20:35.668 --> 20:37.335
I'm checking.

20:47.512 --> 20:48.946
What's the matter?

20:51.617 --> 20:53.384
Why are you looking
at me like that?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.288
Fbi! Drop the gun.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.492
Csi finlay,
gun on the floor.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.927
Now!

21:05.564 --> 21:07.031
Give me the gun, julie.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.969
We have to take you in.
Both of you.

21:26.051 --> 21:29.954
(laptop blipping rapidly
as it downloads)

21:29.956 --> 21:30.721
(blipping stops)

21:38.764 --> 21:39.797
Csi russell.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.967
Special agent
sturgis, fbi.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.702
I'm going to need to
read you your rights.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.637
That's all right...

21:46.639 --> 21:48.706
I think I know them.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.883
Csi russell.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.651
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.321
Well, it's a long trip
from nellis.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.789
General lansdale,
right?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.357
No uniform--

22:06.359 --> 22:09.060
I'm guessing this
conversation's
off the record.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.697
John merchiston...

22:12.699 --> 22:15.466
Man's a murderer.

22:15.468 --> 22:19.403
But worse than that,
he's a threat to this country.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.439
Can you prove either one
of those allegations?

22:21.441 --> 22:22.973
Fbi will.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.342
At this moment,
they're securing

22:24.344 --> 22:28.412
You need to know that my people
had no knowledge of this

22:28.414 --> 22:30.915
Whatsoever.
Does that include csi finlay?

22:31.883 --> 22:33.551
Despite your
best efforts

22:33.553 --> 22:36.554
To alert her, she and
mr. Merchiston are in custody.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.824
I know...

22:39.826 --> 22:42.460
That you have a relationship
with john merchiston.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.496
Maybe you trust him--
but you shouldn't.

22:45.498 --> 22:48.966
I'm not sure who I should be
trusting right now, general.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.803
Well, you certainly
come by <i>that</i> honestly.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.005
I know about
your parents.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.409
About their activities
during the '60s.

22:58.411 --> 23:02.380
But you, you...
You became a cop.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.149
That says a lot about you,
about them.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.586
Must feel sort of odd sitting
on that side of the table.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.455
What do you want?

23:11.457 --> 23:13.524
I want to know
what merchiston told you

23:13.526 --> 23:15.559
About a gentleman named suvari.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.528
He didn't tell
me anything.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.698
I'm here as a courtesy,
mr. Russell.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.601
The fbi can continue
this conversation.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.170
(clears throat softly)
what about my lab?

23:26.172 --> 23:29.774
I don't think it'll look
very good for either
one of us, general,

23:29.776 --> 23:33.611
If the wheels of justice
grind to a halt.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.182
I'll give you
an opportunity

23:38.184 --> 23:40.117
To make arrangements
with your team.

23:41.853 --> 23:44.121
You're a lucky man.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.956
You got a family,

23:45.958 --> 23:48.092
Good job,

23:48.094 --> 23:49.927
So much to live for.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.496
You should know
from personal experience

23:52.498 --> 23:55.132
The cost of misplaced loyalty.

24:16.521 --> 24:18.956
Sturgis:
We believe your friend
john merchiston

24:18.958 --> 24:21.025
Has been receiving leaks
of classified information

24:21.027 --> 24:23.027
Vital to our
nation's security.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.695
Leaks from
an inside source,

24:24.697 --> 24:27.531
Goes by the name suvari.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.099
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Yeah?

24:29.101 --> 24:30.768
Obviously, you
know one thing--

24:30.770 --> 24:32.636
Merchiston faked
his own death.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.772
When he realized
we were closing in on him,

24:34.774 --> 24:36.707
He set up his assistant.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.908
Murdered him.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.578
Then he murdered this woman,
emily rey,

24:40.580 --> 24:43.214
The only other person who could
connect him to this suvari.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.182
Looks like you got it
all figured out.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.517
Why do you need me?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.586
Well, maybe this emily rey

24:48.588 --> 24:51.522
Isn't the only connection
to suvari.

24:51.524 --> 24:55.226
Well, if that's the case,
why didn't john kill me?

24:55.228 --> 24:57.828
I like to think
we saved your life.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.230
Now it's your turn--

24:59.232 --> 25:02.566
To help save the lives
of perhaps thousands, if these

25:02.568 --> 25:04.568
Security leaks
are allowed to go unchecked.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.504
I don't buy it.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.172
(scoffs)

25:08.174 --> 25:12.610
That's... Not the cooperative
attitude I was looking for.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.912
I don't know if you're
protecting merchiston

25:14.914 --> 25:17.581
Because you've fallen for him
or his politics,

25:17.583 --> 25:19.984
Or maybe he's just a great lay.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.852
Honestly, I don't care.
Whatever pillow talk

25:21.854 --> 25:23.954
You two shared,
you are gonna give it up.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.191
At the risk of sounding
like your british boy toy...

25:27.193 --> 25:28.659
We could go all night.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.060
You know what, agent?

25:30.062 --> 25:32.196
That's what you wanted
to say, right?

25:32.198 --> 25:34.532
Brass:
Finlay, I advise you

25:34.534 --> 25:36.300
Not to say another word.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.102
You're here
as an observer, captain.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.870
This is my house;
these are my people.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.105
And if you don't
start acting nice,

25:41.107 --> 25:44.708
I'm gonna kick your fbi
ass right out of here.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.716
Russell. Russell.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.952
Hey, I got your message.
Looks like finn

25:54.954 --> 25:57.254
And I are gonna be here
for a little while.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.657
Merchiston's being charged
with willful communication

25:59.659 --> 26:01.992
Of national defense
information.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.928
And murder.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.096
He's letting his lawyer
do the talking right now.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.731
According to them,
we harbored

26:07.733 --> 26:10.000
Someone who stole secrets,
faked his own death,

26:10.002 --> 26:11.569
And then murdered
two people.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.203
Unless we can prove

26:13.205 --> 26:16.674
That someone was setting
merchiston up the whole time.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.310
I mean, we have
his bloody fingerprint
on the murder weapon--

26:19.312 --> 26:22.112
That makes for a pretty
good argument.
I know, but...

26:22.114 --> 26:25.783
He once did a forensic field
training with scotland yard.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.651
So he's not stupid enough

26:27.653 --> 26:30.154
To leave his bloody
fingerprint behind.

26:30.156 --> 26:33.691
Look, you're the
boss now, bud.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.293
Get us out of here,
will you?

26:49.708 --> 26:52.743
â™ª

27:23.174 --> 27:25.976
Fbi yanked all the files
on the merchiston case,

27:25.978 --> 27:28.746
But I still had a photo
of the bloody fingerprint

27:28.748 --> 27:30.014
In my phone.
Check it out.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.182
Tell me what you see
or what you don't see.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.119
Brody:
Ridge detail's all there.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.354
But there are no pores.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.356
How is that even possible?

27:39.358 --> 27:42.092
We've seen this before,
haven't we, greg?

27:42.094 --> 27:43.227
The millander case.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.228
Mm-hmm.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.362
A serial killer made

27:45.364 --> 27:48.799
A mold of grissom's
print in latex,

27:48.801 --> 27:50.100
Planted it at
a crime scene.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.436
But unlike skin,
latex gives you

27:52.438 --> 27:54.672
Ridge detail but no pores.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.340
Russell was right--
this whole thing's a setup,

27:56.342 --> 27:59.109
From the emily rey murder
to the car crash-- all of it.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.911
Sounds pretty sophisticated.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.147
Do we think
the fbi's involved?

28:03.149 --> 28:05.749
Stokes:
No... No, I think they're
just doing their job.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.451
Well, then
who is it?
I don't know.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.687
But I don't even know
where to start looking

28:09.689 --> 28:10.888
Now that they've walked off

28:10.890 --> 28:13.457
With everything.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.426
Maybe not everything.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.829
Russell gave this to me
right after merchiston

28:18.831 --> 28:20.698
Came back from the dead.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.133
The guy's accused of stealing
classified information--

28:23.135 --> 28:26.070
It might be on there.
It might also show

28:26.072 --> 28:27.738
Who's trying
to set merchiston up.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.473
Even help spring
russell and finn.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.042
Brody:
With all these eyes on us,

28:32.044 --> 28:34.712
It's gonna be almost impossible
to do the job.

28:35.346 --> 28:37.114
All eyes are on <i>us,</i>

28:37.116 --> 28:39.249
But I can think
of somebody who

28:39.251 --> 28:42.119
Might be able to fly
under the radar.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.892
Hey, nick.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.260
Hey.
This was left

28:50.262 --> 28:51.762
At reception.
What is it?

28:51.764 --> 28:53.864
Nevada wireless--
looks like a new phone.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.766
I didn't order a phone.

29:10.014 --> 29:13.450
(music playing in distance)

29:16.855 --> 29:18.288
Hi.
Hi.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.524
I'll have a cup
of coffee, please.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.359
Sure. What flavor?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.027
Coffee-flavored.

29:24.029 --> 29:27.865
Barista:
That'll be $1.35, sir.

29:27.867 --> 29:28.966
Keep it.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.534
Thank you.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.881
You're suvari?

29:43.883 --> 29:46.550
I'm not, but...
He reached out to me,

29:46.552 --> 29:49.920
(over radio):
Said he could help my client
and your csi friends.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.288
Okay. Where is he?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.923
I'm supposed to take you to him.

30:00.565 --> 30:04.434
So, you, uh, decrypted the files
on the flash drive I gave you?

30:04.436 --> 30:09.339
Department of defense documents
relating to project jericho:

30:09.341 --> 30:11.575
The use of drones
to listen in on
communications.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.577
Now, this is all in
the development stages,

30:13.579 --> 30:17.080
<i>But</i> definitely something dod
would not want to go public.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.949
All right,
but is it serious enough

30:18.951 --> 30:21.185
That someone from the government
would be willing to stage

30:21.187 --> 30:24.154
A fake car crash,
murder a woman, just to...

30:24.156 --> 30:26.323
Keep it a secret?
Just because
you're not paranoid

30:26.325 --> 30:27.591
Doesn't mean
they're not following you.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.960
In this case, backseat driving.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.062
What do you mean?

30:32.064 --> 30:33.230
One of the files
references--

30:33.232 --> 30:35.032
(footsteps approaching)

30:37.602 --> 30:39.603
One of the files refers

30:39.605 --> 30:41.839
To wi-fi technology,
which enables a user

30:41.841 --> 30:44.408
To hack a car's onboard cpus--

30:44.410 --> 30:46.977
Specifically, after-market
black boxes,

30:46.979 --> 30:48.979
Like the one that was installed

30:48.981 --> 30:51.481
In merchiston's
rental car.
So you're saying that

30:51.483 --> 30:54.418
They've developed a software
that allows you

30:54.420 --> 30:57.187
To take control of a car...
Remotely.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.189
And remotely crash it.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.191
There's also references

31:01.193 --> 31:03.594
To enhancing the effects
of the accident

31:03.596 --> 31:06.163
With a thermite
cocktail-- ka-boom!

31:06.165 --> 31:07.998
All right, well,
that still doesn't mean

31:08.000 --> 31:10.167
That someone from the government
is behind all of this.

31:10.169 --> 31:13.871
For all we know,
it could be this guy suvari.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.148
You're not gonna tell me
where we're going?

31:25.150 --> 31:27.885
You want to meet
suvari or don't you?

31:27.887 --> 31:30.921
There's a rest stop
outside of searchlight.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.056
He said to wait
for him there.

31:36.928 --> 31:39.963
(engine accelerating)

31:39.965 --> 31:42.633
I'd like to get there
in one piece.

31:42.635 --> 31:44.902
It's not me--
my foot's off the pedal.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.670
Turn off
the cruise control.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.072
No, it's not on.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.077
Try the brakes.
They're not working!

31:56.247 --> 31:58.615
All right, all right, just-just
stay cool, we got this.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.121
What the hell?!

32:04.123 --> 32:05.989
(truck horn blaring)

32:05.991 --> 32:07.591
(mcdermott panting)

32:08.993 --> 32:10.127
(engine roaring)

32:19.404 --> 32:21.538
(engine roaring,
tires screeching)

32:25.610 --> 32:27.344
(tires screeching)

32:35.153 --> 32:37.387
(both panting)

32:40.591 --> 32:42.526
What was that?

32:42.528 --> 32:44.528
I don't know,
but I'm getting the feeling

32:44.530 --> 32:46.530
We just took
the same kind of ride that...

32:46.532 --> 32:49.066
That john's car took.

33:01.579 --> 33:04.081
Wasn't that the... The
coffee guy from the mall?

33:13.257 --> 33:16.059
Well...

33:16.061 --> 33:19.196
Either he just tried
to kill us, or he just saved us.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.264
Either way, he left us this.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.267
â™ª

33:31.743 --> 33:33.043
(computer blipping)

33:35.446 --> 33:38.048
(camera shutter clicking)

34:01.105 --> 34:02.472
(camera shutter clicking)

34:18.489 --> 34:21.291
I told you the truth
would set us all free.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.593
Like I told you...

34:23.595 --> 34:25.362
We're on the same side.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.498
Call 'em.

34:36.841 --> 34:38.442
Hey.
(laughing):
Hey.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.311
Good to be back,
thank you very much.

34:41.313 --> 34:44.347
We heard you and john's
attorney had a close call.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.515
We did.
One that was

34:45.517 --> 34:47.150
Headed off
by your friend suvari.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.386
You actually met him?
So did you.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.654
He served you coffee.

34:51.689 --> 34:54.357
Okay, what have we got here?

34:54.359 --> 34:57.227
Evidence-- proof of the attack
on mr. Merchiston's life

34:57.229 --> 34:59.496
Using a tactic called
"boston brakes."

34:59.498 --> 35:01.198
Boston brakes?

35:01.200 --> 35:04.134
So-called because that was
the first place it was used.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.269
At least,
according to mythology.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.671
And that's all
I thought it was

35:07.673 --> 35:11.741
Till I saw the files your
colleague hodges decrypted.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.611
Project jericho
included a dod program

35:14.613 --> 35:16.279
That developed technology

35:16.281 --> 35:18.849
To hack onboard
computers in cars,

35:18.851 --> 35:21.318
And I think that
suvari wants us to know

35:21.320 --> 35:23.620
It's what happened to this
woman and her son, as well.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.788
Cheryl perez

35:24.790 --> 35:26.523
Worked for dod

35:26.525 --> 35:29.259
As programmer
on project jericho.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.427
Ms. Perez resigned amid rumors

35:30.429 --> 35:31.728
Of an affair
with a high-ranking officer.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.464
General lansdale?

35:34.466 --> 35:35.565
Name never surfaced.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.533
Yeah, but it makes sense.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.768
Suvari told me
he was working

35:38.770 --> 35:41.304
On a story that was going
to send the walls

35:41.306 --> 35:43.306
Of project jericho
tumbling down.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.308
Clearly, he's suggesting
lansdale's behind the murder

35:45.310 --> 35:48.512
Of this woman
to cover up the affair.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.247
There's the chance
that the child found

35:50.249 --> 35:52.449
In the back of the car
is his son.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.584
Finlay:
So now he's targeting anyone

35:54.586 --> 35:55.919
Who comes close
to the truth.

35:55.921 --> 35:59.589
This all looks like, but there
are still missing pieces.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.691
This suvari is
a mystery man.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.393
Coffee vendor said
he rented the stand

36:03.395 --> 36:04.794
Just a couple
of times, paid cash.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.264
But we don't know
who he is or where he's from.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.267
Without him, all we
really have are allegations

36:10.269 --> 36:11.902
Against a high-ranking
air force officer.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.171
So we need to find this suvari.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.338
We're working on it.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.741
We ran diagnostics
on this device.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.743
Suvari definitely
used it to override

36:19.745 --> 36:22.579
Whoever was hacking the
car that we were in, but,

36:22.581 --> 36:25.582
In trying to save us,
I think he left himself exposed.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.617
He left behind
a cyber footprint.

36:27.619 --> 36:31.254
Greg is working on
that isp right now.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.323
(engines revving)

36:50.641 --> 36:52.709
You sure
you found the right place?

36:52.711 --> 36:54.878
Isp traced here.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.713
Stokes:
How? It's not on the grid.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.549
You don't even get
cell phone service out here.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.617
Well, maybe that's the point.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.552
(muffled rock music playing)

37:02.554 --> 37:03.753
Stokes:
Somebody's home.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.726
(rock music blaring)

37:21.973 --> 37:23.673
â™ª

37:30.581 --> 37:33.516
Stokes (loudly over music):
Yeah.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.652
Yeah, photos.

37:35.654 --> 37:36.620
He's definitely been watching.

37:36.622 --> 37:39.356
Bloody duffel bag.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.757
Bloody gloves.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.861
Emily rey's wallet.

37:56.507 --> 37:59.542
Stokes:
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.044
That's-that's suvari,
or whoever he is.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.984
(music stops, computer chirps)

38:08.953 --> 38:11.354
"to whom it may concern..."

38:11.356 --> 38:13.290
What is that, a suicide note?

38:13.292 --> 38:15.292
Oh, it's more than that.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.827
It's a confession...
To all the murders.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.900
I don't buy it.
Oh, me, either.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.670
This evidence, the note...

38:26.672 --> 38:29.673
Somebody sure is giving us
the hard sell.

38:33.778 --> 38:35.779
Sorry, general.

38:35.781 --> 38:39.616
Guess it's my turn
to keep you waiting.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.084
Well, I hope it's
for a good reason

38:41.086 --> 38:42.485
'cause I'm a busy man.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.020
Yes, you are.

38:44.022 --> 38:48.325
You wanted information
on suvari.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.327
Well, we-we found him.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.696
But then again,
I think you know that,

38:52.698 --> 38:55.332
Because you found him first,
didn't you?

38:55.334 --> 38:56.966
His real name is joseph powers.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.636
Former army intelligence.

38:59.638 --> 39:02.839
More recently employed
by ceressus logistics.

39:02.841 --> 39:07.477
He was a-a contractor assigned
to project jericho, wasn't he?

39:07.479 --> 39:11.081
But then again, I have a lot
of people working under me.

39:11.083 --> 39:14.951
How about cheryl perez?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.953
You recognize her?

39:16.955 --> 39:18.722
I heard about her car accident.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.557
Tragic.

39:20.559 --> 39:21.858
Yes, it was.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.393
We were all deeply saddened.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.661
Especially,

39:24.663 --> 39:26.730
Evidentially, joseph powers.

39:26.732 --> 39:30.600
I mean, he-he resigned
a week after the accident.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.737
He just fell right off the grid,
until, of course,

39:33.739 --> 39:35.905
He started reaching out
to john merchiston.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.774
You remember john, don't you?

39:37.776 --> 39:39.743
Where's this going?

39:39.745 --> 39:43.079
Did cheryl perez threaten
to go to your wife or your boss?

39:43.081 --> 39:46.516
Or did she want money
to help support her child?

39:46.518 --> 39:47.684
Your child?

39:47.686 --> 39:49.986
A man with a good job

39:49.988 --> 39:53.757
And a family has so much
to live for, right?

39:53.759 --> 39:56.092
Or... Kill for.

39:56.094 --> 39:59.696
I would be very careful
about what you say.

39:59.698 --> 40:03.800
Why? Am I about
to have a car accident?

40:03.802 --> 40:05.769
See, I know what you've done.
You've used

40:05.771 --> 40:08.505
The entire national security
apparatus,

40:08.507 --> 40:11.975
All of their technology,
to cover up an affair.

40:11.977 --> 40:14.043
You don't know what I've done.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.782
And even if you did,
you wouldn't understand.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.618
You're not a soldier, a patriot.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.921
You are just another
child of the '60s

40:24.923 --> 40:27.557
Who cloaks himself in principle,

40:27.559 --> 40:30.827
While our enemies plot
to bring chaos to our streets.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.796
Well, I am not gonna
let that happen.

40:32.798 --> 40:36.933
And I will stop <i>anybody</i>
<i>who gets in my way.</i>

40:36.935 --> 40:40.870
You know, my-my hippie parents
might not have taught me a lot,

40:40.872 --> 40:43.039
But they did teach me
about patience.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.041
I may not be able

40:45.043 --> 40:46.776
To prove anything today,

40:46.778 --> 40:49.813
But you have involved way
too many people here, general.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.015
And someday, there's gonna be
another joseph powers,

40:52.017 --> 40:53.750
Another person of conscience,

40:53.752 --> 40:56.686
And when they step up,
oh, I'm going to be right there,

40:56.688 --> 40:59.889
Waiting patiently for you.

41:00.991 --> 41:03.059
You're dismissed, general.

41:06.664 --> 41:09.833
I thought your flight left
in the morning.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.201
So did I.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.636
The editor needs to
see me immediately.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.705
Mm.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.976
It's the truth.
I believe you.

41:19.978 --> 41:24.647
Russell is not giving up on
lansdale, and neither am I.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.850
I'll be back.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.885
Good to know.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.890
Look, uh...

41:33.892 --> 41:37.627
That thing that, uh,

41:37.629 --> 41:39.629
You didn't want
to talk about--

41:39.631 --> 41:42.699
Should you ever
change your mind,

41:42.701 --> 41:44.834
I'm an excellent listener.

41:46.871 --> 41:49.839
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.041
Yeah.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.543
Be safe.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.612
Yeah. You, too.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.022
Be well.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.724
Yeah. You, too.
