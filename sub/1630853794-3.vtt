00:27.193 --> 00:30.739
Listen, I just can't thank you
enough for letting us stay
here, Selina.

00:30.822 --> 00:35.618
Please, it's no trouble at all.
The guy I'm seeing has got this
whole wing of a mansion

00:35.702 --> 00:38.997
that's pretty much mine now,
so I'm barely home.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.876
I mean, I was gonna pay someone
to feed my cats,
but now I don't have to.

00:42.959 --> 00:47.756
Great. And you know, I know
we're just guests, so I promise
we will respect your stuff.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.632
What do you think
this is? Ahh!

00:49.716 --> 00:50.967
-[grunts]

on the Sea of Galilee."

Degas's "Program for
the Artistic Soirée 1 and 2."

00:58.266 --> 01:02.228
Dear Lord!
I believe I've solved the
Isabella Stewart Gardner heist.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.356
It's entirely filled with
premium sushi rolls.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.567
[Selina] That's for
the cats only.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.152
They love raw fish.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.488
Obviously, I have cameras
all over the place.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.824
and do not open the room
with the green door.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.495
Princess has been a naughty,
naughty kitty and she's in
time out.

01:18.578 --> 01:22.916
-[Selina] All right, bye.
-Wait, wait! Before you go,
girl, come on, you gotta dish.

01:22.999 --> 01:26.961
Like, tell me about this guy.
What's his butt like?
Like, is it cool?

01:27.045 --> 01:29.005
He's... fine.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.841
Yeah. No, totally.
I bet you could do
so much better.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.801
Mmm-hmm.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.595

01:35.678 --> 01:37.347
Shall I continue?

01:37.430 --> 01:39.516

It's not worth it.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.230
[opening theme music playing]

01:48.775 --> 01:50.944
Honey, can you hand me one of
those clean beakers?

01:52.278 --> 01:55.281
-[loud crash]
-Ow, my penises!

01:55.365 --> 01:57.283
Oh, you mean a
clean, clean one.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.869
Sweetie, I am close to
perfecting this serum.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.790
All I need to do is reduce
the combustion intake by
adjusting the picric acid level

02:03.873 --> 02:09.254
and then adding a small amount
of sodium bicarbonate
to counteract it.

02:09.337 --> 02:12.799
-I'm gonna make it
less explodey.
-Oh yeah. Good thinkin', Ive.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.551
So, next step, I gotta get our
hands on...

02:14.634 --> 02:16.719
-[Harley screams]
-What?

02:16.803 --> 02:20.640
I can't find the damn
unsubscribe button in this
email. It just pisses me off.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.017
-So what we really have to do--
-[Harley screams]

02:23.101 --> 02:25.270
I found the button, thank god.
[sighs in relief]

02:25.353 --> 02:27.230
-[Harley screams]
-And they sent you the email

02:27.313 --> 02:29.524
-confirming you unsubscribed.
-No, no, listen to this.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.652
"The Academy of Evil Arts and
Science, in association with
the Gotham Foreign Press,

02:32.735 --> 02:36.406
is honored to announce the
nomination of Harley Quinn
and Poison Ivy for Best

02:36.489 --> 02:39.909
Couple at the 83rd Annual
Supervillain Awards!"
[screams excitedly]

02:39.993 --> 02:44.372
Ugh, the Villys? Oh, great,
another gaudy award show
for egomaniacs.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.791
Why would they think that we
wanna attend that circle jerk?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.877
Cause I always win that
circle jerk.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.588
Well, why keep jerkin' then?
Why do you need more awards?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.756
Cause all those wins
were with Joker.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.384
That clown kept every
Villy for himself.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.303
Didn't even let me on stage.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.222
I never got to give the
big speech and I live
for the big speech.

03:01.306 --> 03:05.101
Hell, one time he didn't
even take me, he just took
one of his goons.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.437
-Dean.
-Oh it was Dean?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.565
I wanna be on that stage with
you, holding up our Villy right
in middle of that circle jerk.

03:10.648 --> 03:15.278
Honey, I just got my lab setup.
I've got momentum on this plan.
I'm in the zone!

03:15.361 --> 03:18.281
And I mean like, when
have I actually even used
the words "in the zone"?

03:18.364 --> 03:20.325
Oh, can't you step out of the
zone for one night,

03:20.408 --> 03:21.951
and then after pop
right back into the zone?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.786
-Please, please...
-[exhales sharply]

03:23.870 --> 03:27.290
-Okay, okay, screw it,
let's go win this award.
-[Harley screams]

03:27.373 --> 03:30.209
But I'm having three
Long Island ice teas
and no one's stopping me.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.253
-No ice.
-Fuck yeah!

03:32.337 --> 03:36.174
First thing tomorrow, Martha,
I announce my retirement
and focus on our family.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.426
Put little Brucie on, will ya.

03:38.509 --> 03:42.639
Heya, sport. I know I haven't
always been here for you,
but I promise that's over now.

03:42.722 --> 03:46.851
Tell mother to wear her pearls
cause tonight we're going to
the movies!

03:46.935 --> 03:49.771
And... cut! great take.
moving on.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.982
Ugh, God, my back is killing me

03:53.066 --> 03:55.526
-[chair vibrating]
-[moaning] There it is!

04:02.951 --> 04:04.285
Willie Rob!

04:05.328 --> 04:06.996
Might not recognize me.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.875
Lotta hair and makeup...
I play the chair.
The director's chair.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.252
Maybe you could, say, sit on me

04:13.336 --> 04:15.713
in exchange for
one-on-one acting lessons?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.382
I don't sit.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.385
Ah, the Christopher Nolan
school of acting,
no sitting on set.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.552
I don't ever sit.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.722
Me neither.
Another standing pooper!

04:24.806 --> 04:28.393
-James!
-Eatin' a Danish.
Just tastes better on set.

04:28.476 --> 04:32.855
Look, it's just buddy, this,
this dialogue. I mean. It's not
humming, ya know?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.732
Ugh, it hums.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.693
[Billy Bob] Hey, you know what?
Maybe we could meet
at your place?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.194
-Mmm.
-You know, cook some dinner,
and do a re-write?

04:38.277 --> 04:40.196
It's like what
Warner Bros told me

04:40.279 --> 04:44.534
while I was writing the
"Scooby-Doo" movie.
It's all about the edit.

04:44.617 --> 04:51.541
[chuckles] On second thought,
forget everything I just said!
And let's meet tonight.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.085
-[tense music plays]
-[chuckles nervously]

04:55.503 --> 04:57.296
Cool.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.551
And we say happy Villy Sunday
from Gotham City's
lovely Crime Alley.

05:01.634 --> 05:06.055
Ooh, Riddler, Clock King.
congrats on the nom for
Best Couple.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.391
Thanks, Tawny,
It's a big category.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.143
Lotta great couples this year.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.438
Now you two were some of
Gotham's first openly
gay villains.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.523
Must not have been easy.

05:15.606 --> 05:19.360
[laughs] You might say the
hardest riddle I ever solved
was my own sexuality.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.572
Luckily, I figured it out
just in time.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.741
-Oh god, you turn my gears.
-Come here.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.868
-Oh, okay, now don't
lean, that's okay.
-Oh, oops, get in there!

05:26.951 --> 05:28.578
-[kissing noises]
-Aw.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.997
And Clock King,
can you tell us
who you're wearing?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.708
Of course, Tawny my clock
tonight is by the master, Patek
Philippe, it's a chronometer...

05:33.791 --> 05:36.794
-You didn't tell me we had to
walk the red carpet.
-But you love walking!

05:36.878 --> 05:38.963
[Poison Ivy groans]

05:41.007 --> 05:44.510
Don't forget to re-apply
lipstick before they
announce your name.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.929
Need that bold lip pop
on camera.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.516
It's the other dynamic duo:
Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy!

05:50.600 --> 05:53.728
I can't tell ya how great
it feels to be here
for another Villy,

05:53.811 --> 05:56.314
and with time
with the love of my life.

05:56.397 --> 06:00.026
Well, girl,
this is the first time
you're running minus the Joker.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.944
Think you can do it
without him?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.531
When we're up on that stage
everyone will forget
about Mr. J.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.451
It's all about
my sweet love Poison Ivy.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.538
Okay, well, Ivy, everybody's
clamoring to see those claws.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.791
Is there a theme
to your nails tonight?

06:14.874 --> 06:18.211
Uh... social anxiety, I guess?

06:18.294 --> 06:19.462
[Tawny] Oh...

06:21.714 --> 06:25.301
God, they run out of those
little quiches so fast,
huh, Ive?

06:25.384 --> 06:28.054
If I stand here no one can ask
me who I'm wearing.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.098
Okay, I know it's a lot,
but you're doing great.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.643
-Promise, the show itself is
pretty low drama.
-[sighs]

06:33.726 --> 06:35.812
Uh, hey, excuse me,
can you pass me the water?

back my pasta maker if they
don't want things to be weird.

No, no. We all think it's cool.

Maurice's twin sister.

campaigning for you two.

to get the upper hand.

a little underhanded, right?

me the envelope.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.185
I will look at it,
maybe cross somethin' out,

10:44.268 --> 10:46.312
but hopefully not.
Then you take it back,

10:46.395 --> 10:49.815
pretend this never happened.
Otherwise, I'm gonna kick
your math-lovin' ass.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.571
Uh, wait, do androids piss?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.448
[yelps, groans]

10:57.531 --> 10:58.949
[low growl]

10:59.033 --> 11:00.576
[ominous music plays]

11:05.873 --> 11:06.874
[sighs in exasperation]

11:06.957 --> 11:08.751
-[woman] Need a charger?
-Thanks.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.003
It's nothin'. I never leave
home without it.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.756
Which makes me think,
maybe I'm addicted to screens?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.925
[chuckles] I mean,
who isn't, right?

11:18.469 --> 11:19.887
Man... [exhales]

11:19.970 --> 11:21.806
-this night sucks.
-Oh, why's that?

11:21.889 --> 11:25.267
Ugh, it's just my girlfriend's
obsessed with winning
this award.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.435
This whole thing is just,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.270
it's not my scene.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.274
I wanted to spend
the night at home,
working on my diabolical plan.

11:32.358 --> 11:37.405
[gasps] Diabolical work
on a Sunday?
It's the Lord's Day.

11:37.488 --> 11:41.075
Joke. I know
the sabbath's on Saturday.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.660
This would be killing
if you knew me

11:42.743 --> 11:45.538
because I am not religious.
[chuckles nervously]

11:45.621 --> 11:47.790
No, it was a good joke.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.794
You know, to make matters
worse, those assholes assigned
me to sit next to my ex-fiancé.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.755
I hear that. I couldn't even
get myself to go in.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.174
I'm supposed to be in there
with my new boyfriend,

11:57.258 --> 11:59.301
but I am way too nervous.

11:59.385 --> 12:03.806
-Why's that?
-Those assholes assigned us
to sit next to his ex-fiancé.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.559
[gasps softly]
You are Kite Man's girlfriend.

12:08.394 --> 12:15.025
And the award for the Most
Creative Nom de Plume goes to
Cock King!

12:15.109 --> 12:19.905
Oh! He's a chicken. [laughs]
That is creative.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.617
[doorbell dinging]

12:25.077 --> 12:27.079
The muse has arrived.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.499
James! I brought bread.
Thought we'd break it.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.418
Isn't your hair
usually spikier?

12:32.501 --> 12:36.338
[awkward laugh]
If I learned anything from
my seven years acting

12:36.422 --> 12:43.679
on the Amy Sherman-Palladino
dramedy Gilmore Girls
as the quirky town resident--

12:43.762 --> 12:46.557
I'm gonna stop you there.
James Gunn doesn't act.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.519
Everybody knows his brother
Sean played Kirk on
Gilmore Girls!

12:50.603 --> 12:54.273
You clicked
the wrong Wikipedia, didn't ya?
You're not James Gunn.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.695
-You're a monster!
-No, no, no. I...
I'm the chair! Remember?

12:59.778 --> 13:03.741
You can turn yourself into
anything, but you use your
talent to become chairs?

13:03.824 --> 13:06.535
Well, I'm not strictly.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.704
At first I thought,
maybe you're a stalker.

13:08.787 --> 13:13.209
But I can see behind those
horrific clay eyes,
you're just a hungry actor.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.211
Oh, how I starve!

13:15.294 --> 13:17.671
You know, I've been thinking,
maybe it's time for me
to take on a protege.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.257
And Chair Guy,
I think you may be it.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.675
[excitedly] Huzzah!

13:21.759 --> 13:23.219
I gotta go take a piss,
but when I get back

13:23.302 --> 13:24.970
your life is gonna be
changed forever, son.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
-Where's the shitter?
-First door on the left.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.476
Or was it the first door
on the right?

13:30.559 --> 13:32.436
[Billy Bob] Holy shit,
is that a tiger?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.231
-[tiger roars]
-[Billy screams]

13:35.314 --> 13:36.941
-[tiger roars]
-[glass breaking]

13:39.360 --> 13:40.819
[keypad beeping]

13:40.903 --> 13:43.989
-[King Shark] Hello?
-Shark? Perchance you're free?

13:50.996 --> 13:54.750
[sniffles] So moving.
Gone, but not forgotten.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.587
Next is a special award
given only to
the truly deserving.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.382
The baddies who make
a real difference.

14:01.465 --> 14:07.555
This year's
recipient of the Joe Chill
Honorary Award is... Catwoman!

14:07.638 --> 14:10.808
-[laughs boisterously]
-[audience clapping]

14:10.891 --> 14:14.019
Let's forget the fact that I'm
not even really a villain,

14:14.103 --> 14:15.604
I'm an anti-hero.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.649
The only reason you gave me
this award is cause I'm Black.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.654
After eighty-plus years
you finally realize

14:23.737 --> 14:25.864
you haven't let
a single Black villain win.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.783
No matter how much
we deserve it.

14:27.866 --> 14:30.828
Black Manta's
been out here for years
as a marquee villain,

14:30.911 --> 14:32.621
and you don't see him
getting an award.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.292
-He's black?
-And you think you can satisfy
your white guilt

14:36.375 --> 14:38.794
with one apology trophy
named after...

14:38.877 --> 14:41.672
you guessed it,
a white dude.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.215
[cell phone vibrates]

14:43.299 --> 14:44.717
[tiger roaring]

14:46.552 --> 14:48.262
Why am I wasting my breath?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.976
-So you're...
-Golden Glider.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.896
Yes... Right. You're, you're
the one who glides with
your, your...

14:57.980 --> 15:03.027
I have these special ice skates
that let me glide in the air.
Whoosh, shwing!

15:03.110 --> 15:04.737
Woah. Look at that.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.740
-They're like kites
for your feet.
-That's what Chuck said!

15:07.823 --> 15:12.494
Oh, wow. So you guys know each
other's secret identities?
I mean, that's pretty serious.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.788
It was months before Kite Man
told me his real name.

15:14.872 --> 15:19.627
I mean, I know
it's pretty fast,
but yeah it feels real.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.836
Has he made you the
chili yet?

15:20.919 --> 15:23.589
I love the chilli.
It's incredible.

15:23.672 --> 15:27.676
Right? Ah, he gets
so obsessive about
picking each veggie.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.762
It's almost like no onion
is perfect enough for him.

15:29.845 --> 15:33.515
Oh, actually I hate...
hate, hate, hate onions,
so he stopped using them.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.143
Really? Gosh, but, Kite Man
loves onions.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.187
I mean, that's was like his
number two thing under kites.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.898
I guess it's like how he took
out the meat when he made it
with you.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.026
Huh. Kite Man's
a really good guy.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.819
He's so good
at being supportive,

15:45.903 --> 15:47.613
even if it's a sacrifice
for him.

15:47.696 --> 15:51.367
Yeah. We're both... lucky.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.120
Well, you know what? Fuck me.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.040
I don't matter.
You shouldn't be nervous
because of me.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.001
I mean, the only person
you should give
a snowrat's ass about

16:01.085 --> 16:03.003
in that tacky theater is Chuck.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.756
I mean, you're here
because of him,
and I'm here because of Harley.

16:05.839 --> 16:11.053
So, let's just go be in there
for them because they sure
as hell would be there for us.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.389
Hell yeah.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.266
[grunts]

16:17.893 --> 16:19.478
[aggressive screaming]

16:19.561 --> 16:20.854
[muffled scream]

16:20.938 --> 16:21.897
[Harley straining]

16:24.775 --> 16:27.778
Ugh. Fuck off,
I was perfectly blended.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.780
Hi-Yah!

16:34.743 --> 16:36.829
[ominous music plays]

16:39.707 --> 16:41.333
[screams, groans]

16:46.672 --> 16:47.589
[man clears throat]

16:50.217 --> 16:52.094
-[screams]
-Ahh, someone's in here!

16:52.177 --> 16:54.179
Ugh, move it or lose it
Invisible Kid.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.474
-Uh, I'm Imperceptible Man.
-[door opens]

16:57.558 --> 16:59.685
Oh my god,
he did not wash his hands.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.687
[Harley grunts]

17:05.941 --> 17:07.818
[groans, growls]

17:10.195 --> 17:12.406
[grunting]

17:15.367 --> 17:18.245
[panting, grunts]

17:21.373 --> 17:23.125
[laughs]

17:23.208 --> 17:24.376
[gasps]

17:27.588 --> 17:29.757
Ugh, you're such a dick.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.050
[screeching]

17:32.134 --> 17:35.137
I sure hope we didn't have to
censor any of that. [laughs]

17:35.220 --> 17:40.350
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It
was a very touching speech
about your mother's leukemia.

17:40.434 --> 17:44.146
Thanks, bud. Uh, BTDubs,
I don't currently have
a bladder infection,

17:44.229 --> 17:48.192
but the best prevention is
to keep crushing these
vodka cranny-cran-crans.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.111
Lisa!

17:51.195 --> 17:52.821
-Ohhh!
-[gasps]

17:52.905 --> 17:55.908
-That's my babe.
-I'm so sorry I'm late, Chuck.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.159
No problemo, mon amour.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.203
I'm just happy we're together.

17:59.286 --> 18:03.123
Although now,
I do have to leave you
to use the little kite's room.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.168
[humming]

18:06.251 --> 18:07.711
[gasps, screams] Harley!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.172
What's going on here?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.883
[sighs sharply]
I'm lactating?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.929
You know, this was my
first time at the Villys.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.097
Always wanted to go,
never got invited,

18:19.181 --> 18:22.643
until last week, I got
nominated for "Best D-Lister"
at the less publicized,

18:22.726 --> 18:25.521
but definitely equally
prestigious Technical
Villy Awards.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.856
-Did ya win?
-I did not.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.025
Lost to a guy
with a gun for a penis.

18:30.108 --> 18:33.403
But sitting in that rented out
kid's dance studio, it hit me,

18:33.487 --> 18:36.198
the only reason I got nominated
was 'cause of Ivy.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.535
Dating her made me
want to be a better person,
a better villain.

18:39.618 --> 18:44.706
Hell, when I first met her I
was a delusional, nobody himbo.
Now I'm big enough

18:44.790 --> 18:47.042
-to lose Best D-Lister.
-But Ivy left you.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.504
Yeah, and now I'm with Lisa
and she rules.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.548
Things are working
out for the ole Kite Man.

18:52.631 --> 18:58.220
And win or lose tonight,
they seem to be working out
for you too.

18:58.303 --> 19:03.559
Now, if you will excuse me,
I gotta do a yak-attack of some
vodka crans in that stall.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.812
-[retches]
-[vomiting]

19:06.895 --> 19:08.897
[King Shark yelling]

19:10.190 --> 19:11.942
It's taken care of.

19:12.025 --> 19:16.488
A moment of silence
to honor the talented
Mr. Thornton's life.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.073
[cell phone vibrating]

19:18.156 --> 19:20.742
Well, I'm done for. It was good
knowing you, friend.

19:20.826 --> 19:25.247
Too bad you can't turn into
Billy Bob Thornton and live-out
your dream as a movie star.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.583
It'd be far too much
to keep up with.

19:27.666 --> 19:33.297
Balancing his busy life with
your own much-less busy but
probably still important life.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.217
Screw Clayface!
I choose Thornton.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.095
Billy, you were right.
I looked at the script,
made a few changes,

19:40.178 --> 19:44.474
added some incongruous songs
to spice in some humor.
I think you're going to love!

19:44.558 --> 19:48.937
Terrific. Oh, how I,
Billy Bob Thornton,
alive and well,

19:49.021 --> 19:53.108
do love our camaraderie,
James Gunn.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.944
Cool.

19:58.614 --> 20:02.075
Okay, bitch,
wait what happened to you.
You know what? I can guess.

20:02.159 --> 20:07.122
Let's win this Villy,
crush the acceptance speech,
and make that trophy a cuck.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.707
Totally! How?

20:08.790 --> 20:11.627
Uh, by making it watch us have
crazy sex till dawn. Duur.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.547
Okay, I absolutely love that
image. But Ive, I am so sorry.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.634
You've had real anxiety
all night, and I
should've helped.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.802
I was so fixated on that award
when I was with Joker

20:20.886 --> 20:22.971
cause it was the
only validation I ever got.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.140
But that was a
bad relationship,

20:25.223 --> 20:27.059
and I have grown beyond that.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.686
So who cares about
a dumb trophy?

20:29.770 --> 20:32.648
I've got the real award
right here.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.275
That's so sweet. But
I should've been more excited.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.986
I mean, this is
important to you,
so it is important to me.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.197
-[Harley] Aw...
-[kissing noises]

20:40.280 --> 20:44.534
You wanna ditch this hellhole?
Get some Big Belly Burger?
Tie up the employees?

20:44.618 --> 20:47.496
Maybe take silly photos in our
fancy dresses?

20:47.579 --> 20:51.083
Uh, hard yes. I'd kill for a
grilled cheese right now.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.670
And you know we're taking those
silly photos. It's not gonna be
silly how hot we look.

20:54.753 --> 20:59.174
-Fuck you, Villys.
-Yeah. Fuck you Villys!
And your vegan apps suck.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.886
Don't put a leek
on a crostini and call it an
hors d'oeurve!

21:06.598 --> 21:12.646
Now, the moment we've all been
waiting for... The final award:
Best Couple.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.942
And the Villy goes to...

21:18.986 --> 21:20.946
Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy!

21:21.029 --> 21:23.031
-What?
-Boo!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.825
[sobbing]

21:24.908 --> 21:28.537
We will never win
and it's because of my big
stupid clock for a face.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.871
-Hey!
-Don't touch me.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.583
You are beautiful.
And you are loved. By me.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.669
I don't even know
what time it is.

21:36.753 --> 21:40.590
I said Harley and Ivy!

21:40.674 --> 21:42.551
Where is that damn seat filler?

21:42.634 --> 21:47.514
So, going to any of those cool
after-parties later?

21:47.597 --> 21:52.477
Hmm, well only one thing to do.
Trophy's mine! [laughs]

21:52.561 --> 21:55.939
On behalf of Harley and Ivy,
I'd like to thank
my loyal goons.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.607
Dean, shout out.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.610
Laura, my co-class mom,
shouldn't be gendered.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.572
And of course my better-half
Bethany. Muah!

22:03.655 --> 22:05.365
You are my rock.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.243
And hey kids, you'd better be
off to bed, but if not,

22:08.326 --> 22:10.912

Good night!
[laughs maniacally]

-I love you so much.
-Come here.

-Okay.
-Don't put your head
right into my face.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.253
