[croaking]

00:30.572 --> 00:32.198
No time to celebrate yet.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.035
We have to stop those creatures
from getting to the surface.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.036
[grunts]

00:36.119 --> 00:37.787
Yeah! Kong-vator time!

Daylight! Keep it up, Kong.
We're almost back home.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.499
[grunts]

01:22.582 --> 01:24.459
What is it?
Where are we, Kong?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.877
[grunts]

01:25.960 --> 01:27.837
-Whoa!
-Increíble!

01:28.797 --> 01:33.009
[Danny] Okay, so we either popped out
in the middle of a super cool movie set,

01:33.593 --> 01:35.053
or we're in Egypt, right?

01:35.136 --> 01:36.221
[tourists screaming]

01:42.268 --> 01:44.312
Look out!

01:44.395 --> 01:46.397
[Panchi] We have to stop them
from hurting people

01:46.481 --> 01:48.566
or damaging the historical monuments.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.026
Yeah, but how?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.153
All I know for sure is
we have to find some way

01:52.237 --> 01:54.322
to get them all back underground,
where they belong.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.992
Hmm. Before anyone finds out
about the secret world below.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.370
Right, or the apes
and everything down there

02:00.453 --> 02:01.704
will be doomed for sure.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.540
[grunts]

02:03.623 --> 02:04.624
Let's go.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.417
[tourists screaming]

02:06.501 --> 02:09.169
Wow, I forgot how bright the sun is.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.133
-[croaks]
-[screams]

02:15.135 --> 02:16.678
Look out!

02:18.471 --> 02:19.430
Oh, no! Look!

02:29.107 --> 02:30.608
[man screaming]

02:37.657 --> 02:40.410
We have to find a way to catch them
before someone gets hurt.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.619
[gasps] Like him!

02:41.703 --> 02:44.247
-Aw, this is going viral for sure!
-[camera shutter clicks]

02:44.330 --> 02:46.332
[Lukas] Look out! [grunts]

02:48.501 --> 02:51.379
Thanks, man. You saved me from getting...

02:51.462 --> 02:52.797
-Croaked?
-[camera shutter clicks]

02:52.881 --> 02:55.049
No time for selfies. Run!

02:55.133 --> 02:56.342
[man yells]

03:10.189 --> 03:11.941
I wish we could keep Kong hidden,

03:12.025 --> 03:14.444
but there's no way
we can do this without you, bro.

03:15.069 --> 03:15.987
Don't worry,

03:16.070 --> 03:19.824
no one will arrest you as long as
you're saving them from giant spiders.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.456
-[woman] It's Kong!
-[man] Look out!

[tourists clamoring]

03:56.319 --> 03:58.947
People are gonna have to see this
to believe it.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.698
[roaring]

04:02.533 --> 04:04.494
¡Están vivos!

04:04.577 --> 04:05.828
[in English] They're alive!

04:08.665 --> 04:11.542
Surrounded by gigantic monsters, though.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.921
[squawks] Giant spiders and frogs! Oh, my!

04:15.004 --> 04:18.298
Oh, they're alive. Thank heavens.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.343
[squawks] Alive! Alive!

04:20.426 --> 04:22.637
I must tell Jonesy the good news.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.472
Ha! I already know, Anita.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.350
Then you must hurry to Egypt
and bring them home.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.895
[Jonesy] Already there. I've been tracking
the signal from the big guy's comm unit.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.690
It's led me to the Pyramids of Giza
just outside Cairo.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.777
What's happening?
It looks like they're fighting giant bugs.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.780
They are.
And I'm gonna help with pest control.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.622
[Kong grunting]

04:52.834 --> 04:55.128
-That looks like...
-[all] Jonesy!

05:00.216 --> 05:04.012
[laughs] Ho! Oh, ho! Whoa!

05:06.639 --> 05:08.808
[chittering]

05:08.891 --> 05:11.436
Oh, no! Zippi stowed away on Kong.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.104
You'll have to deal with the baby.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.399
I'll fill Jonesy in on the situation.
[grunts]

05:16.482 --> 05:18.276
-[Danny] Zippi, stop!
-[Panchi] Come back!

05:18.359 --> 05:20.987
-[Zippi chittering]
-[Danny] No!

05:21.070 --> 05:23.072
[grunting]

05:25.241 --> 05:27.493
-Hey, hey! [laughs]
-[Lukas] Whoa!

05:28.745 --> 05:30.163
You okay?

05:30.246 --> 05:32.790
[chuckles] Yeah,
I'm just seriously confused.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.125
Is that a dinosaur?

05:34.208 --> 05:37.545
[chuckles] Explanation's gonna
have to wait.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.630
First, we have to get
all those prehistoric beasts

05:39.714 --> 05:41.382
back into their subterranean world.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.052
Okay, that's not something
you hear every day.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.637
-[Kong grunts]
-[Kong and Jonesy laugh]

05:46.721 --> 05:48.931
Yeah! Good to see you too, Kong.

05:51.934 --> 05:52.894
Look out!

05:52.977 --> 05:54.103
-Duck!
-Whoa!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.151
[Kong roaring]

06:02.070 --> 06:04.489
Oh! Ew!

06:04.572 --> 06:06.574
[grunting]

06:21.172 --> 06:25.051
Oh, Kong! You're a genius!
You figured out how to capture them.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.677
Keep it up, bro!

06:27.970 --> 06:29.055
We've got company.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.432
[sirens wailing]

06:31.516 --> 06:34.811
We gotta save the animals
before these guys try to shoot them down.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.606
We need some kind of cover.
You know, like a desert sandstorm.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.653
If Kong and you guys can handle the rest,
I can whip up a storm.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.614
Crunch time.
Danny, you're with me and Kong.

06:46.697 --> 06:50.618
I'll go with Jonesy to keep Zippi
out of trouble. Hopefully.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.831
Buckle up and hang on.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.958
[chittering]

07:06.384 --> 07:07.844
It's showtime!

07:13.766 --> 07:16.853
[sirens wailing]

07:21.482 --> 07:25.361
Sandstorm coming!
Everyone get inside that pyramid!

07:25.445 --> 07:27.530
[tourists screaming]

07:27.613 --> 07:30.616
Oh, forget that. This is too awesome--
[screams]

07:35.705 --> 07:40.001
[coughing] That's it, Kong.
Now, let's take them home.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.601
[gasps]

08:20.917 --> 08:23.336
[both grunting] Kong!

08:26.631 --> 08:29.008
[all screaming]

08:47.235 --> 08:49.862
Okay, not as planned.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.782
-But you did save all the creatures, bro.
-[apes grunting]

08:57.245 --> 08:59.080
It wasn't us.
It was Richard.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.375
I'm sorry for what my brother did,
but right now we need to get up there

09:02.458 --> 09:04.585
to plug that hole
before any more can escape.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.296
[grunting]

09:09.382 --> 09:11.634
[all grunt]

09:11.717 --> 09:14.345
Aw, the apes are sad
because they're afraid

09:14.428 --> 09:18.099
once we plug that hole,
Kong can't find a way down here again.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.602
[grunting]

09:24.981 --> 09:25.982
[sighs]

09:26.065 --> 09:31.112
I promise that we will find a way
to bring Kong back to see you... someday.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.578
[apes grunting]

09:42.498 --> 09:46.460
Really sorry to break this up, bro,
but we've got to get back topside.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.097
All right, now we need to figure out a way
to plug the fissure,

09:58.180 --> 10:00.516
so that no one will realize
it was ever there.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.144
[gasps] The sarcophagus!

10:03.227 --> 10:04.770
[grunts]

10:04.854 --> 10:09.066
I don't know. It's so massive,
I'm not sure Kong can even budge it.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.819
-[Danny] Push, Kong, push! Harder!
-[Lukas] Come on, bro, push!

10:11.902 --> 10:13.738
[Danny and Lukas] You can do it!

10:13.821 --> 10:15.531
[Lukas] I believe in you!

10:15.615 --> 10:16.991
Not even an inch.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.202
I know you can do it!
Put your back into it, bro!

10:22.538 --> 10:24.540
[grunting]

10:26.876 --> 10:28.127
That's it, Kong!

10:28.210 --> 10:29.795
-[Danny] Come on, push!
-[Lukas] Push!

10:29.879 --> 10:31.797
-[Danny] Push! You can do it!
-[Lukas] Push!

10:34.925 --> 10:36.302
[Danny laughing] Awesome!

10:36.385 --> 10:40.097
-[Lukas] Yeah! I knew you could do it!
-[grunting happily]

10:40.181 --> 10:42.975
[chuckles] Way to go, big guy!
Never a doubt.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.061
[grunting]

10:46.562 --> 10:48.564
[sighs]

10:50.608 --> 10:54.445
Seems like it's finally safe to come out.
[yelps]

10:54.528 --> 10:56.822
-[Lukas] Richard!
-Or perhaps not.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.907
[growls]

10:57.990 --> 11:01.369
-[gasps]
-Quick, Kong. Capture that coward!

11:01.452 --> 11:04.538
[gasps and moans]

11:04.622 --> 11:07.917
I don't understand why you're so upset.
You should be thanking me

11:08.000 --> 11:10.044
for saving you
from that underground prison.

11:10.127 --> 11:13.130
[Jonesy] Lukas, I can't keep this storm up
much longer, man.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.048
What should I do?

11:15.424 --> 11:17.760
[sighs] We'll deal with him later.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.304
Okay, Jonesy, pull back.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.191
[sirens wailing]

11:32.274 --> 11:37.113
What a shame. Looks like there's no escape
for the world's most famous fugitives.

11:37.196 --> 11:41.242
Last I heard,
Kong was wanted dead or alive.

11:41.325 --> 11:45.287
[sighs] Jonesy, I'm going out first
and letting them arrest me.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.331
No! You can't.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.500
It's the only way, Danny.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.127
That'll give you time
to create another diversion,

11:51.210 --> 11:52.920
so the rest of you can escape.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.881
[grunting]

11:55.965 --> 11:58.968
It's all right, bro. I'll be okay.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.054
Just take care of yourself and the kids.
Promise?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.140
[grunts softly]

12:07.977 --> 12:10.938
Hold your fire.
I'm coming out.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.159
-My name is Lukas Remy and I--
-[tourists gasp]

12:23.242 --> 12:26.078
-That's him!
-[indistinct chatter]

12:30.458 --> 12:33.335
Whoa! Awesome!

12:33.419 --> 12:35.504
I don't believe it.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.132
Me neither, but it's great.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.593
[grunting happily]

12:40.676 --> 12:43.137
-[man] That's him.
-[tourists cheering]

12:44.221 --> 12:46.390
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.728
We have all seen the news reports
about how you and your magnificent ape

12:50.811 --> 12:54.023
were framed by your brother,
Dr. Richard Remy.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.567
-[man] Yeah, he's a monster.
-[woman] He's the guy.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.944
Looks like the world
finally knows the truth.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.740
Kong's a superhero
and you're a super zero.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.327
-[grunting happily]
-[tourists] We want Kong!

13:06.410 --> 13:08.162
[cheering] We want Kong!

13:08.245 --> 13:10.080
We want to see Kong!
Come on!

13:10.164 --> 13:13.417
Danny, tell Richard to get back
in the sarcophagus and hide.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.337
I don't understand.
Why don't we just turn him in?

13:16.420 --> 13:20.132
If they catch him, Richard may tell them
about the subterranean world.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.134
We can't let that happen.

13:24.887 --> 13:30.226
Everyone, meet Kong, King of the Apes!
Come on out, bro!

13:31.352 --> 13:33.395
-So cool!
-[tourists cheering]

13:43.030 --> 13:45.616
It's okay, Kong.
They love you again.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.040
Oh, it's so beautiful.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.544
Kong is finally getting
the love he deserves.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.921
Now, Zippi, you be a good girl

13:59.004 --> 14:02.091
and stay hidden in here,
where you'll be safe. Okay?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.425
[chitters]

14:03.509 --> 14:05.678
[tourists cheering]

14:12.726 --> 14:14.728
[sniffling]

14:14.812 --> 14:17.273
Yeah, me too, bro.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.484
[laughs] Enjoy it.
You've earned every cheer you get.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.527
[grunts]

14:21.610 --> 14:25.447
Lukas Remy, how does it feel
to finally be vindicated?

14:25.531 --> 14:28.784
[laughs sheepishly] We had no idea we were
until this moment.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.413
Everyone in the world now knows
you're the real heroes.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.959
However, your brother,
Dr. Richard Remy, is wanted

14:37.042 --> 14:41.881
on criminal charges in several countries
and will be arrested on sight.

14:41.964 --> 14:47.511
I swear I'll get even with all of them,
especially Botila the Hun.

14:47.595 --> 14:52.808
Someday, somehow,
they will pay for ruining my life.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.479
[Botila] I cannot believe
they survived the fall into the volcano.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.317
That giant ape is harder to destroy
than a cockroach.

15:01.400 --> 15:06.447
And speaking of filthy little insects,
could it really be?

15:07.531 --> 15:09.783
Enhance image 800%.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.329
Richard.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.997
Screen off.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.875
I should have deduced they were alive.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.711
Why else would Mr. Jones
be tracking a signal

15:20.794 --> 15:22.796
from the volcano to Cairo?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.341
Ooh, I know, I know!

15:26.091 --> 15:28.886
It is not a quiz, you titanium twit.

15:30.846 --> 15:35.225
[groans] I really must adjust
their enthusiasm levels.

15:37.311 --> 15:41.357
Luckily, Jonesy was too preoccupied
trying to locate his comrades

15:41.440 --> 15:44.860
to bother scrambling
his communication frequencies.

15:44.944 --> 15:50.950
I'm now certain the signal he was tracking
came from a new device on Kong.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.494
Now that my enemies have been resurrected,

15:53.577 --> 15:57.456
the defunct Kong Island
is no longer a safe hideout.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.918
Major bummer, boss.
We had some good times here.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.170
Enough of your positivity.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.925
The AI Liberation Front is going mobile.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.806
-[clone 1] Groovy! Road trip!
-[clone 2] Oh, yeah! Bring it!

16:32.074 --> 16:38.664
Now, I can navigate anywhere.
Water, land, air, and even space.

16:38.747 --> 16:42.084
-[clone 1] All right!
-[clone 2] Launch and load!

16:42.167 --> 16:46.255
Ugh, I've had it
with you overzealous space cadets.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.799
[clones squeal]

16:56.265 --> 16:59.226
I'm going to beat the authorities
to Richard.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.146
No one is going to keep me
from my revenge.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.653
I want the entire squadron of bionobots
on this mission.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.031
Richard won't get away this time.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.964
[grunting playfully]

17:31.550 --> 17:33.343
[tourists applauding]

17:34.261 --> 17:35.804
[reporter] Everyone is wondering

17:35.888 --> 17:39.391
how you were able to survive the fall
into an active volcano?

17:39.475 --> 17:42.352
We wouldn't have if Kong hadn't saved us.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.483
Mr. Remy, how do you explain
dozens of eyewitnesses swearing

17:47.566 --> 17:51.737
that Kong saved them
from actual, gigantic frogs and spiders?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.114
[chuckles] That sounds ridiculous.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.699
It would be impossible.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.453
They must be more of
your brother's bionobotic beasts, right?

17:59.536 --> 18:00.704
Like those?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.206
[bionobotic dinosaurs screech]

18:02.289 --> 18:04.833
[tourists clamoring]

18:08.170 --> 18:10.506
Clones, destroy them.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.513
[tourists screaming]

18:17.596 --> 18:19.139
[roars]

18:20.432 --> 18:22.643
Where's Richard?
And what have you done

18:22.726 --> 18:26.438
with all those giant bionobot frogs
and spiders he created?

18:26.522 --> 18:29.441
Don't worry about
the other monsters, Botila.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.151
Kong already took care of them.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.403
Yeah, like he's gonna take of you.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.532
[roaring]

18:36.615 --> 18:38.450
You asked for it.

18:42.121 --> 18:42.996
[Panchi] Look!

18:44.540 --> 18:48.710
Oh, no! They're heading for our chopper,
and Zippi's inside!

18:48.794 --> 18:50.921
We need to get airborne
before they destroy our ride.

18:51.004 --> 18:51.922
[Lukas grunts]

18:56.969 --> 18:58.053
[gasps]

19:02.307 --> 19:04.059
[clones squeal]

19:04.935 --> 19:06.937
Major miscalculation.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.107
He got to us before we got to the chopper.
Oops.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.233
[sighs]

19:14.361 --> 19:16.280
[giggling]

19:16.363 --> 19:17.906
One more cheery chirp

19:17.990 --> 19:20.534
out of either one of you
and I'll bury you myself.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.246
-[both giggling]
-[sighs in exasperation]

19:27.291 --> 19:29.710
[Botila] This isn't over!

19:30.544 --> 19:32.546
[roars triumphantly]

19:35.424 --> 19:37.050
[tourists cheering]

19:40.888 --> 19:42.723
[grunts happily]

19:47.144 --> 19:48.854
Great job, Kong!

19:52.399 --> 19:54.610
Now only one question remains.

19:54.693 --> 19:58.197
Where is the diabolical
Dr. Richard Remy hiding?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.912
Buh-bye, brother dear.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.293
We better go after him.
Now that Richard's a--

20:11.376 --> 20:14.504
Uh, sir, you have a very important call.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.798
Extremely important.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.765
Uh, yes, Madam President.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.768
Of course, we'll come immediately...
with Kong.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.029
