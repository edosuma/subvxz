a great kisser.

08:50.114 --> 08:52.032
- I've seen the way
- she plays the trumpet.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.617
(BLOWING RASPBERRY)

08:58.830 --> 09:00.374
I just couldn't be

09:00.375 --> 09:01.917
happier for Charlotte.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.627
(SCREAMING)

09:07.381 --> 09:08.901
- (SHOUTING)
- What are you staring at?

09:17.015 --> 09:18.080
JESSIE:

09:18.081 --> 09:19.143
Welcome to our

09:17.015 --> 09:19.143
first rehearsal.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.832
I want you all to

09:20.833 --> 09:22.396
feel free to explore

09:19.268 --> 09:22.396
your characters.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.322
- But if you change
- one word of my dialogue,

09:24.356 --> 09:25.517
- You're going
- to detention.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.236
Wow, somebody

09:29.237 --> 09:31.405
went through puberty

09:27.067 --> 09:31.405
awful fast.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.679
It is makeup.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.826
It will help me get

09:31.530 --> 09:35.826
into character.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.057
And if you get lost,

09:37.058 --> 09:38.162
into the animal shelter!

09:38.287 --> 09:39.663
(SNARLS)

09:39.788 --> 09:41.388
- Ravi, I appreciate
- your dedication...

09:41.415 --> 09:43.292
- Good. Because I
- have many questions.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.668
When was I first bitten?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.483
Oh! When I kill,

09:46.484 --> 09:48.255
do I feel remorse?

09:48.380 --> 09:49.674
How do I keep my fur

09:49.675 --> 09:50.966
shiny and manageable?

09:52.676 --> 09:53.427
- I don't know,
- I don't care,

09:52.676 --> 09:53.676
And conditioner!

09:56.472 --> 09:58.641
Jessie, what do you think

09:58.642 --> 10:00.809
of this for Luke's character?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.207
You know,

10:02.208 --> 10:03.479
army uniforms

10:00.934 --> 10:03.479
shouldn't sparkle.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.001
It kinda undercuts

10:05.002 --> 10:06.398
the whole

10:03.603 --> 10:06.398
camouflage thing.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.817
Now, where's the

10:08.818 --> 10:10.402
actress playing me?

10:10.528 --> 10:11.611
I mean, Josie?

10:11.736 --> 10:12.821
- Haven't you heard?
- Oh!

10:14.781 --> 10:15.949
Poor Charlotte was

10:15.950 --> 10:17.117
coming down the stairs

10:17.242 --> 10:18.891
and slipped on

10:18.892 --> 10:20.538
a limited edition

10:17.242 --> 10:20.538
Tickle Me Voldemort doll.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.582
Well, that's odd.

10:23.707 --> 10:24.708
Voldemort doesn't

10:24.709 --> 10:25.709
strike me as a giggler.

10:27.503 --> 10:28.838
So sadly,

10:28.839 --> 10:30.172
the only cast Charlotte's

10:27.503 --> 10:30.172
going to be in

10:30.297 --> 10:31.756
- is a full-body cast.
- (LAUGHING)

10:33.217 --> 10:36.220
I mean, aww.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.098
So you love Harry Potter,

10:40.224 --> 10:41.684
and the Dark Lord

10:41.685 --> 10:43.143
just happened to end up

10:40.224 --> 10:43.143
taking out your competition?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.895
How do you explain that?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.897
- Death Eaters are
- everywhere.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.464
Jessie,

10:50.465 --> 10:51.569
don't you see what's

10:49.358 --> 10:51.569
going on here?

10:51.693 --> 10:53.007
Creepy Connie wants

10:53.008 --> 10:54.321
to play Josie

10:51.693 --> 10:54.321
so she can kiss me!

10:54.446 --> 10:56.047
- And who can - blame her?
- But help me!

10:57.533 --> 10:59.284
- Maybe she's just
- excited to be a part of

10:59.410 --> 11:00.829
Such a groundbreaking

11:00.830 --> 11:02.246
piece of theater.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.623
You are aware

11:03.624 --> 11:04.873
we're all doing this

11:04.998 --> 11:06.125
just to get out

11:06.126 --> 11:07.251
of Home Ec, right?

11:10.629 --> 11:11.714
Well, actually,

11:11.715 --> 11:12.797
I was not aware

11:10.629 --> 11:12.797
of that.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.469
- That explains
- your attitude

11:17.595 --> 11:19.036
- And why you can't
- work a blender.

11:21.599 --> 11:22.974
Anyway,

11:23.100 --> 11:24.202
- Becky Greenberg is
- next in line for the part.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.978
Becky Greenberg?

11:27.104 --> 11:28.980
She is the understudy.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.066
Right. Uh-huh.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.776
- Yeah, the six feet
- understudy.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.447
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

11:36.572 --> 11:37.969
That's fine.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.366
You're the director.

11:36.572 --> 11:39.366
You know best.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.534
(CHUCKLING)

11:42.327 --> 11:44.371
(YELLING) Ow!

11:44.496 --> 11:46.696
- Ravi, that was fabulous,
- but save it for show night.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.255
(VACUUM WHIRRING)

11:57.384 --> 11:58.802
Done! Ha!

11:58.927 --> 12:00.534
Vacuumed all 14 stairs

12:00.535 --> 12:02.139
in two minutes,

11:58.927 --> 12:02.139
six seconds!

12:02.264 --> 12:03.848
Now that's fast!

12:03.974 --> 12:06.810
ZURI: No, this is fast!

12:06.935 --> 12:08.215
- (TIRES SCREECHING)
- (WHIRRING)

12:12.232 --> 12:13.442
Where did you get that?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.152
Tony knows a guy.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.195
He pimped my ride.

12:19.615 --> 12:20.699
(MUSIC PLAYING)

12:30.083 --> 12:32.085
Whoo!

12:36.465 --> 12:38.008
Emma, my dad sent

12:38.009 --> 12:39.551
this flamethrower

12:39.677 --> 12:41.219
- for Ben to use
- in the play.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.097
Your dad had

12:43.098 --> 12:44.848
a flamethrower just

12:41.345 --> 12:44.848
lying around the house?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.649
- Yeah. - He's too cheap to
- Buy a barbecue.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.707
Okay, BTW,

12:49.708 --> 12:51.271
do not push that button.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.317
All right!

12:55.442 --> 12:56.756
Okay, let's

12:56.757 --> 12:58.069
start rehearsal.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.384
Where is my actress

12:59.385 --> 13:00.572
playing Josie?

13:00.698 --> 13:01.740
Haven't you heard?

13:04.326 --> 13:07.120
Unfortunately, poor Becky

13:07.121 --> 13:09.914
had a terrible mishap

13:04.326 --> 13:09.914
in shop class today.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.480
- Somehow,
- and this is a weird one,

13:13.877 --> 13:15.003
Her braces got welded

13:15.004 --> 13:16.129
to a crescent wrench.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.881
How did that happen?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.612
I have to believe

13:19.613 --> 13:21.259
basic safety rules

13:17.964 --> 13:21.259
were violated.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.785
But poor Becky

13:25.786 --> 13:27.974
can't even say who did it,

13:23.595 --> 13:27.974
because she can't talk.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.187
(SCREAMING)

13:33.564 --> 13:35.232
But I'm available.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.442
Pucker up, Luke.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.447
Jessie! Sidebar?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.619
Open your eyes!

13:47.745 --> 13:49.472
- Can't you see - Connie is bumping
- Off the competition?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.560
Luke, we open tomorrow.

13:50.561 --> 13:51.623
I don't have time

13:49.496 --> 13:51.623
for your paranoia!

13:51.749 --> 13:53.291
- So, what are we
- talking about?

13:53.751 --> 13:55.628
We're talking about

13:55.629 --> 13:57.504
how Dina Papadakis

13:57.629 --> 13:59.130
- is going to be
- our new Josie!

13:59.256 --> 14:02.342
Oh, congratulations, Dina!

14:02.467 --> 14:05.011
I am so happy for you.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.326
You deserve

14:06.327 --> 14:07.514
everything that's

14:05.136 --> 14:07.514
coming to you.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.393
Run!

14:14.521 --> 14:16.732
Dina, wait!

14:16.940 --> 14:18.525
- Now what am I
- gonna do?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.253
- Unless I can find an actress - who
can learn that part - In one day,

14:20.277 --> 14:21.737
My New York debut

14:21.738 --> 14:23.196
is ruined!

14:23.321 --> 14:24.553
Lucky for you,

14:24.554 --> 14:25.783
I know the part forwards.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.659
"Ben, you know you are

14:27.660 --> 14:29.369
the only one for me."

14:29.494 --> 14:30.662
And backwards,

14:30.788 --> 14:31.873
"Me for one the only

14:31.874 --> 14:32.956
you know you, Ben."

14:35.250 --> 14:36.460
Part the got you, wow!

14:38.796 --> 14:40.088
You're my new Josie!

14:40.213 --> 14:41.257
Oh, my gosh!

14:41.258 --> 14:42.299
This is so exciting!

14:42.424 --> 14:43.825
- I've got to go
- scrape my tongue.

14:47.304 --> 14:51.057
What is on her tongue?

14:51.182 --> 14:52.863
- And why does she
- have to scrape it off?

14:59.190 --> 15:00.609
Ta-da!

15:00.734 --> 15:01.985
My souffle!

15:02.110 --> 15:03.654
(CHUCKLES)

15:03.779 --> 15:05.093
Prepare to taste

15:05.094 --> 15:06.406
a culinary feat.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.096
If your dessert

15:08.097 --> 15:09.660
tastes like feet,

15:06.531 --> 15:09.660
you don't stand a chance.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.996
(BELL DINGS)

15:13.037 --> 15:14.436
My Queasy Bake

15:14.437 --> 15:15.833
brownies are done!

15:15.999 --> 15:18.585
Yay! They came out perfect!

15:18.710 --> 15:20.671
(SNICKERS)

15:20.796 --> 15:22.517
- Okay, let's see what
- Mr. Kipling thinks.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.665
- BERTRAM:
- He'll choose mine.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.139
Yes!

15:31.264 --> 15:32.850
No!

15:33.016 --> 15:34.643
Hey, you put crickets

15:34.644 --> 15:36.269
in your brownies?

15:36.394 --> 15:37.604
That's cheating!

15:37.729 --> 15:39.564
No, that's good butlering.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.859
Mr. Kipling's eating,

15:41.860 --> 15:44.027
but you just got served.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.068
You're mean.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.133
- Well, Josie, - I should be getting
- Back to the base.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.848
But Ben, every time

15:51.849 --> 15:54.538
we say goodbye,

15:49.157 --> 15:54.538
it's like

15:54.663 --> 15:56.247
- (MOUTHING)
- a grenade to the heart.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.043
(RAVI HOWLING)

16:00.084 --> 16:01.252
The moon is full

16:01.253 --> 16:02.420
and I must feed!

16:05.089 --> 16:06.842
- I think I integrated
- that pretty well.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.137
Stay away from that girl!

16:11.262 --> 16:12.890
Mortal fool.

16:12.891 --> 16:14.516
Only silver can

16:11.262 --> 16:14.516
kill a werewolf.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.642
Oh, thanks

16:15.643 --> 16:16.643
for the tip.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.523
Oh! Silverware!

16:21.648 --> 16:22.648
The pain!

16:24.317 --> 16:25.317
Ah!

16:26.945 --> 16:28.446
(GROANING DRAMATICALLY)

16:29.406 --> 16:30.532
Zip it, Fido!

16:30.533 --> 16:31.658
You're dead!

16:35.579 --> 16:37.622
This is torture.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.270
Oh, Ben, how can I ever

16:39.271 --> 16:40.792
thank you for saving me?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.177
- Ooh...
- Up top!

16:57.935 --> 16:59.811
- This is where
- we're supposed to kiss!

16:59.937 --> 17:01.022
Yeah, not gonna happen.

17:01.023 --> 17:02.105
You were lucky I gave you

16:59.937 --> 17:02.105
a high-five.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.919
- Wait a minute,
- that's not in my script.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.211
- I am not leaving
- without a kiss.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.799
That's not

17:08.800 --> 17:10.363
a good idea, Josie.

17:07.234 --> 17:10.363
(COUGHS)

17:10.488 --> 17:11.965
- I think I'm coming down
- with something.

(COUGHS)

17:13.201 --> 17:14.409
I'll risk it, Ben!

17:14.534 --> 17:15.765
Luckily, I have

17:15.766 --> 17:16.994
a very strong

17:14.534 --> 17:16.994
immune system.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.289
Ah!

17:20.958 --> 17:22.710
Kiss me, kiss me,

17:22.711 --> 17:24.461
kiss me now!

17:30.759 --> 17:32.073
I'm starting to think

17:32.074 --> 17:33.386
maybe Connie was

17:30.759 --> 17:33.386
lying about

17:33.511 --> 17:34.991
- the whole
- "being over Luke" thing.

- Bertram, wake up.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.911
It's finally getting good.

17:58.954 --> 17:59.954
LUKE: Connie, no!

18:01.331 --> 18:02.916
Oh, Jessie, help!

18:02.917 --> 18:04.501
I told you Connie was

18:01.331 --> 18:04.501
still creepy!

18:06.586 --> 18:08.171
You know, Ben,

18:08.296 --> 18:10.173
I'm tired of being

the one who always

18:08.296 --> 18:12.050
gets burned.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.469
- Does she know
- about the button?

18:15.512 --> 18:16.512
(LUKE SCREAMING)

18:18.682 --> 18:21.002
- She knows about the button!
- She knows about the button!

18:22.727 --> 18:23.061
I'm going in!

18:23.186 --> 18:24.187
Wait!

18:24.270 --> 18:26.857
Here!

18:26.982 --> 18:27.732
Is this flame retardant?

18:27.858 --> 18:29.860
No, but it's super cute.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.657
- Are you okay...
- Ben?

18:37.868 --> 18:39.912
I am an oddly dressed MP,

18:39.913 --> 18:41.955
here to help.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.667
I don't know what's worse,

18:45.668 --> 18:47.627
her writing or her acting.

18:47.752 --> 18:48.900
This is more confusing

18:48.901 --> 18:50.047
than Inception.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.008
What is the problem?

18:55.052 --> 18:55.844
- For starters,
- your outfit!

18:55.969 --> 18:57.199
(GASPS)

18:57.200 --> 18:58.429
That was snippy.

19:00.682 --> 19:01.955
You have to learn

19:01.956 --> 19:03.226
to accept it if a guy is

19:00.682 --> 19:03.226
not interested in you.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.151
- Well, how do you know
- he's not interested?

19:05.228 --> 19:07.522
ALL: He's not interested!

19:08.481 --> 19:10.608
Nobody asked you!

19:10.734 --> 19:12.443
- Look, you need to
- find someone else.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.697
But no one likes me.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.741
Oh, gee, I wonder why.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.180
Maybe it's because

19:19.181 --> 19:20.493
you're creepy,

19:17.866 --> 19:20.493
and you cook people!

19:22.453 --> 19:24.248
Connie...

19:24.249 --> 19:26.041
I mean, Josie,

19:26.249 --> 19:27.876
look, you are

19:27.877 --> 19:29.502
a beautiful, smart girl,

19:26.249 --> 19:29.502
okay?

19:29.627 --> 19:31.588
Forget Ben!

19:31.713 --> 19:32.986
Somewhere out there is

19:32.987 --> 19:34.257
a guy who's gonna

19:31.713 --> 19:34.257
appreciate you.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.927
Or a wolf!

19:38.595 --> 19:39.679
I thought you were dead.

19:39.804 --> 19:40.847
Uh...

19:40.972 --> 19:42.495
That silverware

19:42.496 --> 19:44.017
was not real silver.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.351
- Just cheap
- stainless steel.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.023
The point is,

19:50.148 --> 19:51.275
I find your fiery nature

19:51.276 --> 19:52.400
and lack of stability

19:50.148 --> 19:52.400
quite alluring.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.486
You do?

19:58.656 --> 19:59.866
Oh, what the heck?

19:59.991 --> 20:00.992
Come here, Wolfie!

20:01.118 --> 20:03.703
Yes! I have me a woman!

- of a Burmese python!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.337
Everyone bow!

20:14.714 --> 20:15.966
Emma, lower the curtain!

20:18.551 --> 20:19.719
No! Not that rope!

20:19.844 --> 20:20.887
(SCREAMING)

20:23.222 --> 20:25.350
Yes, this UFO would've

20:25.351 --> 20:27.477
made a lot more sense

20:23.222 --> 20:27.477
if we had gotten to Act Three.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.068
Hey, Bertram,

20:35.069 --> 20:37.403
wanna read my report

20:32.732 --> 20:37.403
on you and your job?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.489
- No. If I wanted to
- read mean things,

20:39.614 --> 20:41.512
I'd check the comments

20:41.513 --> 20:43.409
on that video you kids posted

20:39.614 --> 20:43.409
of me farting in my sleep.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.580
- "Beddytime Butler
- Boom Booms."

20:48.539 --> 20:49.749
That one's classic.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.795
Will you just read this?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.423

- What are you guys
- looking at?

21:49.475 --> 21:50.519
The review of your play

21:50.520 --> 21:51.561
on the school website.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.667
They said it was

21:53.668 --> 21:55.648
my best performance

21:51.686 --> 21:55.648
since gingivitis.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.934
- What did they say - about my writing
- And directing?

21:58.735 --> 22:00.195
Huh!

22:00.403 --> 22:02.215
- I'm surprised - they're allowed to
- Use words like that

22:02.239 --> 22:03.406
On a school website.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.076
Well, at least one good

22:06.077 --> 22:07.202
thing came out of it.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.515
You realized

22:08.516 --> 22:09.620
the only Tony you're ever

22:07.410 --> 22:09.620
gonna get is our doorman?

compose yourself.

garrote me like

22:33.519 --> 22:34.709
Yeah. I was just

22:34.710 --> 22:35.897
giving him

22:33.519 --> 22:35.897
a friendship necklace.
