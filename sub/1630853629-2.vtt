the kids for the new school year.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.401

She was going on about
wanting a new look for high school,

00:53.928 --> 00:56.222

some stuff from my closet.

wanna dress like BlackGirlTragic?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.480

is your credit score.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.777

No, you may not.
You better steal this stuff from work.

to handle your Bennie situation.

stop thinking of him as your husband.

Maybe. Possibly.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.145

10:47.605 --> 10:49.273
I thought you might waffle.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.692
So I did some digging.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.654
The soil was wet, so I got a good start.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.656
I also got some information.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.950
I figured if Bennie was cheating,
the girl would call the shop,

11:00.034 --> 11:02.536
because, you know,
Bennie ain't that smart.

11:02.620 --> 11:08.501
Sure enough, one number hit him up
every day for the past two weeks.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.171
And it's not tied
to any account in our records.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.339
So you called it.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.423
So I called it.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.677
It was a woman, Regina.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.347
I only got a voicemail,
but she sounded like a side chick.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.100
-[Regina sighs]
-You know, breathing in between each word.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.400
[inhales] You know,
part of me ain't even mad.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.653
Well, can I talk to the part that is?
Because we got shit to do.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.366
Bennie told me that
I needed him to be a mess.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.159
And, apparently, he's right.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.746
He's only doing what I let him do.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.332
How can I go after a man for that?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.126
At night when he's sleeping.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.629
Bennie had a break baby,

11:53.713 --> 11:56.257
and I just bought that kid
school supplies.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.635
Bennie stole money from me,

11:59.719 --> 12:03.305
and I slept with him
before he even paid me back.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.850
-And don't forget the time--
-Oh, no, no, no.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.978
I am not gonna let you stand here
and make this your fault.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.064
You are two people who made choices.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.359
Bennie's made his choice.
You can make a different one.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.444
With what?

12:16.527 --> 12:20.990
A breathy voicemail greeting
and him not being where he said he would?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.450
Is that… Is that…

12:22.533 --> 12:24.785
Is that enough to end a marriage?

12:25.369 --> 12:27.329
Is it worth packing up my girls?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.957
Why are you packing?
He's the one that needs to go.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.209
Wow, what would that even do to them?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.754
They'll get to see their mom
handling her business.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.964
[exhales sharply] Nope. Mm-mmm.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.716
Not gonna let this weigh heavily on me.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.510
When he gets home,
I'mma just ask his ass straight out.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.262
No, no, no.

12:43.345 --> 12:47.725
See? That's how
that wiggly bastard gets away with stuff.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.270
Don't say anything until I get proof.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.522
-[sighs]
-Look, I'll get you all the proof.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.816
We gonna bury his ass.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.445
And then we gonna bury his ass.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.781
[instrumental music playing]

13:01.864 --> 13:02.740
[exhales]

13:02.823 --> 13:05.701
-Yeah.
-That was a hell of a ride you gave me.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.204
Yeah. I wanted to hit it a little harder,

13:08.287 --> 13:10.748
but I didn't want the cops on us.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.292
[both laughing]

13:15.377 --> 13:17.755
-[sighs]
-Look, this is our fourth test drive.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.381
Are you gonna buy the car or not?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.051
Hmm.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.220
-I do love the interior.
-All right.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.889
-And the cupholders are surprisingly big.
-[Bennie laughs]

13:27.556 --> 13:29.809
Come on now. I can't keep
running all over town now.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.727
You're right. You're right.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.396
You know what? I think I'm ready.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.648
All right. Let's--

13:35.731 --> 13:38.567
Let me see how it handles
on the way to my dry cleaner.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.986
Oh, Lord.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.405
[car engine starts]

13:43.489 --> 13:46.242
[instrumental music playing]

13:49.245 --> 13:50.204
[grunts]

13:51.455 --> 13:53.749
Ah! I gotta pee, gotta pee!

13:54.250 --> 13:56.126
Better stop drinking them big-ass sodas.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.088
Dr. Pepper don't even drink
that much Dr. Pepper.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.924
Bennie, you all kind of bold and crazy.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.093
-Running with your lady in the daylight.
-No, man.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.720
Buying her flowers
and wrapping her clothes up in plastic.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.558
It's like they used to tell me in prison,
"You run, you gonna get caught, Duck."

14:10.641 --> 14:12.601
-What you trying to say?
-You cheating on Regina.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.728
Get the hell out of here.
Ain't nobody cheating.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.813
Trying to get me killed?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.815
Man, quit playing, all right?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.400
We know she's your girl.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.443
And, by the looks of it,
she got you whipped.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.072
Whipped? Your girl treats you
like 12 Years a Slave.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.159
I'm not sleeping with that girl.
I'm trying to sell this car, man.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.911
-You're trying to sell the Camaro?
-Yeah.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.455
I love this car. Shit, I'll buy it.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.957
Sometimes, when you cut out early,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.459
I sit in the car
making vroom-vroom noises.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.295
Well, you can't afford it.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.547
Yeah, I'm already
garnishing half your wages.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.717
How come you didn't just tell us
that's what you was doing?

14:44.800 --> 14:48.178
'Cause I want it to be a surprise.
I'mma give Regina the money.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.306
-Oh!
-Oh! [laughing]

14:50.389 --> 14:52.474
Finally treating her the way I ought to.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.392
Huh?

14:53.475 --> 14:55.144
She ought to be treated.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.354
Hey, my heart is full for you, brother.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.272
Yeah.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.566
If you're trying to
surprise Regina, hurry up.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.234
She was sneaking around here earlier.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.446
-Shit. When? Hell, no.
-Yeah. You got lucky 'cause we covered.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.949
Oh, my God. Hey, look.
I gotta sell this car today.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.410
Duck, take the overalls off.
Act like you're buying the car.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.828
Yeah. I wish I could.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.788
You need to tuck in your religion.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.457
I knew you before Jesus did.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.710
Yeah, it ain't that. It's just,
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.462
-Oh!
-Oh, God damn!

15:22.046 --> 15:23.881
Duck, your laundry room ain't haunted.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.215
I know what I heard.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.260
Hey, man. I got you.
I got you, man. What's the plan?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.179
-Okay, this is the plan.
-[Tony] All right.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.639
-When she get back out…
-Okay?

15:31.722 --> 15:33.223
-…you gonna bid on the car.
-Okay.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.935
-She'll raise it. You back off.
-Okay.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.853
Then that's when I sell it to her.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.814
Women always want
what they can't have. Come on, boy.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.817
I can't be party to this.
I'm gonna go read my Bible,

15:43.901 --> 15:45.611
where the women are treated well.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.115
Look, there she is. Hey, hey, hey.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.244
Mr. Upshaw. I know I've been
putting you through it.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.204
You have.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.247
But I gotta sleep on it another night.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.875
Well, do what you got to do now

15:59.959 --> 16:02.461
'cause this man right here
is ready to buy the car.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.004
-Oh, no. Really?
-[Tony] Yeah.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.756
Twenty-five big ones.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.007
-Yeah.
-Wow!

16:07.091 --> 16:09.009
That's way more than we talked about.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.761
Enjoy your car.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.179
Wait. Uh, hold up now.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.973
Uh, what were y'all talking about?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.599
-Fifteen.
-Oh, okay.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.267
Uh, I can only swing ten.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.645
-I'd rather do eight.
-I'll tap out at six.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.147
Hey. Look,
we're haggling in the wrong direction.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.108
-Oh…
-Uh… [sighs]

16:24.608 --> 16:25.943
I'm not an idiot.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.987
If you're gonna try to scam me,

16:28.070 --> 16:30.698
do it with somebody
I didn't see working here this morning.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.367
Come on. Hey, hey. Listen, man.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.703
You gotta buy the car, okay?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.663
My wife is trying to go back to school.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.373
And it's expensive.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.042
And I ain't always done right by her.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.045
And I'm just trying to step my game up.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.006
Please.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.091
That's sweet.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.511
Look. You wanted fifteen.
I'm comfortable at twelve.

16:52.594 --> 16:55.556
So why don't we circle up
at thirteen-five and call it a deal?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.350
Girl, I could kiss you…
And you know what? I'm not…

16:58.434 --> 17:01.186
And I didn't. I just told her I could.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.523
But I want an oil change
and some new tires. I see that tread wear.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.984
Oh, shit, that's from
driving you around town.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.362
I'll have a check for you
when I pick it up tomorrow.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.701
Uh, there you go.
You gonna run home and tell Regina?

17:15.784 --> 17:19.121
I ain't telling Regina nothing
until I get that money in her hand.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.331
[exhales] Yeah, marriage is complicated.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.168
I'm almost glad my girl turned me down.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.337
[instrumental music playing]

17:27.421 --> 17:30.007
Thanks for letting me be here
for Sydney's first day of school.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.384
She looked cute
in that outfit you bought her.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.344
You always could put a look together.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.681
Oh, my bad, was that homophobic?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.350
You know, I actually don't know.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.977
I'm still learning myself.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.812
But I do love a compliment. So, thanks.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.482
[both laughing]

17:47.608 --> 17:48.776
Sydney likes me, right?

17:49.610 --> 17:53.280
She is nine. She'd follow a clown
into a sewer if he had McDonald's.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.532
Now, come on.
I gotta be doing better than that.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.993
You're doing fine. Don't rush it.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.248
I'm just glad I finally get a chance
to know her away from my crazy-ass family.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.168
-[sighs] Look, the fact is--
-[doorbell chimes]

18:08.837 --> 18:10.047
-Really?
-What is it?

18:10.130 --> 18:11.799
Your crazy-ass family.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.305
Hey, girl.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.182
Oh. Hey, nephew.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.434
Auntie, how did you know I was here?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.728
I ain't here for you.
I need to talk to her.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.688
[groans] Lord, give me the strength.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.816
If the man don't want to
take a paternity test, he--

18:28.899 --> 18:31.110
No, we ain't on that. You're a cop.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.320
I need you to run a phone number for me.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.115
We can only do that
if it's part of an investigation.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.408
Oh, well, we may be
on the verge of a homicide.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.787
You can't keep barging
into Monique's life asking for shit.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.163
She never signed up for that.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.124
Bennie's stepping out on your mom again.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.291
Can you run a number?

18:47.584 --> 18:50.671
Fine. I'll do it when I get to work.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.005
And just a little advice.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.966
Don't be sneaking around
a cop's house, okay?

18:54.049 --> 18:55.384
That's a good way to get shot.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.470
[scoffs] Please. You can't outdraw me.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.598
[instrumental music playing]

19:01.682 --> 19:04.059
Gonna be late. I'll miss breakfast.
Gotta get to the shop.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.477
Who is she, Bennie?

19:05.561 --> 19:08.564
Damn, I shouldn't have
stopped to hug Maya.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.609
Every bone in my body wants to
give you the benefit of the doubt.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.238
I am begging you. Please have an answer.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.699
If I could tell you, I would tell you.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.286
What kinda man shit is that? No!

19:23.036 --> 19:24.288
No, we're not doing that.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.249
Uh-uh. You're gonna give me
an answer right now

19:27.332 --> 19:29.334
or you're gonna find the locks changed.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.753
Since you standing over there
by them knives…

19:32.337 --> 19:33.338
There is a woman.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.383
Damn you, Bennie.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.635
She the one
you were texting with yesterday?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.388
Yeah, only because we were doing a deal.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.764
I sold her my car.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.768
The car is in the driveway, jackass.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.147
Not that family piece of shit. My Camaro.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.065
I wanted to surprise you.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.109
I sold it for thirteen grand.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.402
Thirteen?

19:55.986 --> 19:56.820
No, I'm lying.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.239
It was thirteen-five.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.575
I was trying to pocket the five.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.078
No. You would never sell the Camaro.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.372
Yeah, but I owed you.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.880
I thought we'd never be cool
because of that money.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.258
I might be back in,

20:18.342 --> 20:21.553
but we ain't cool
because of that debt between us.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.764
Thirteen is more than what you took.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.932
So what?

20:25.432 --> 20:27.100
I know what school mean to you.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.352
Spend it on that.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.896
Or spend it on
something else that you deserve.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.190
You sold the Camaro for me?

20:35.525 --> 20:37.236
It was a pain in the ass, too.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.782
Well, let me holla at you.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.453
I gotta hit it from the back
'cause I ain't brush my teeth.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.165
[instrumental music playing]

20:50.249 --> 20:53.543
Why am I hearing you have a twin when
I clearly told you I wasn't doing that?

20:53.627 --> 20:55.754
Chill. I never said my twin was you.

20:55.837 --> 20:59.091
We have the same dad, genius.
What happens if he comes to a parent day?

20:59.174 --> 21:01.802
Seriously, have you not met
the adults in our life?

21:01.885 --> 21:03.512
Oh, my God. Jessica Friers is coming.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.805
Shut up.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.223
Hey, Jess.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.601
Dang, Aaliyah, you really do have a twin.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.521
Y'all are even dressed the same.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.315
Savannah.

21:15.857 --> 21:16.817
Hey, girl.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.945
This whole thing
should have stopped in pre-k.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.033
-Why are you dressed like me?
-Why are you dressed like me?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.327
Kelvin told you to wear this
and you said no.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.704
So I had my mom buy it.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.581
Hey, I wanna look fly for my first day.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.459
Great call, by the way.
I'm getting lots of looks.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.337
We both are.
People think we're cycle twins.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.716
Go home. Or at least hide
in a locker or something.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.426
And miss the first day? [scoffs]

21:42.509 --> 21:44.553
That's when they hand out the syllabi.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.930
Well, I'll catch you after class, Aaliyah.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.141
Savannah? Wait, Aaliyah?

21:49.224 --> 21:51.184
[chuckles] It's so hard to tell.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.026
You better sit down.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.903
I had Monique run that number.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.740
Oh, what are you doing
putting that out there like that?

22:04.823 --> 22:06.533
You needed more proof, so I--

22:06.616 --> 22:10.037
Bennie is not cheating, okay?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.247
He told me the whole thing this morning.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.124
So he told you about Darlene.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.500
Who's Darlene?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.002
The woman with the phone number.

22:17.085 --> 22:20.589
Oh, yes. But he's not
sleeping with her, okay?

22:20.672 --> 22:24.009
Get this, he sold his Camaro to her.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.262
Oh, Regina.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.389
No, he did!

22:29.473 --> 22:31.516
All so he could pay me back.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.436
My man did right. Thirteen G's worth.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.774
It's like watching a squirrel
that fell from a tree.

22:39.316 --> 22:43.153
I don't know if I should swaddle you
or just snap your neck to end the pain.

22:45.155 --> 22:48.241
Lucretia, please mind your business.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.952
Bennie and I are good.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.330
Okay. All right. Well, answer me this.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.000
-If Bennie sold his Camaro…
-Uh-huh?

22:57.084 --> 23:00.045
Then why is it
at the shop with no tires on?

23:02.339 --> 23:03.757
Is that a rerun?

23:04.466 --> 23:05.425
What the hell?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.011
I didn't wanna be right.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.390
That mother…

23:11.473 --> 23:14.059
He stood right here. And…

23:15.394 --> 23:16.853
Oh, hell, no.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.900
Oh, he thinks he can do this
to Regina Upshaw?

23:21.983 --> 23:24.069
Oh, no… You were never no Upshaw.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.196
But the Turners about to turn up.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.489
Oh, damn right!

23:27.572 --> 23:29.074
Bennie don't even know.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.618
About to have a "talk" talk with his ass!

23:31.701 --> 23:33.829
Yeah. Get him, girl. [chuckles]

23:34.413 --> 23:36.206
Burn his shit to the ground.

23:36.289 --> 23:37.791
No, wait, that's my shit.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.877
[instrumental music playing]

23:40.961 --> 23:43.088
Come on, Bennie, let me have it.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.381
I'll pay you monthly.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.716
I'll take it out
of the money I hide from my girl

23:46.800 --> 23:49.010
when I don't give her
my whole paycheck. Huh?

23:49.678 --> 23:51.596
Man, this is a man's car, Tony.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.723
You're giving it to a woman.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.310
Man, don't you got some poems
to go write or something?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.980
That car don't look sold to me.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.941
Hey, Regina, baby. What's up?
What you doing up here?

24:03.650 --> 24:08.029
I came to thank you
for all you do, my king.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.533
See, when you do
the right thing by your woman,

24:11.616 --> 24:13.368
these are the things that happen for you.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.286
Okay.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.955
They come to you in a good way…
What is wrong with you?!

24:17.038 --> 24:18.081
Oh, my God!

24:20.041 --> 24:21.585
What's wrong with you? Why you put…

24:21.668 --> 24:22.878
I could've left, Bennie.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.881
I could've left.
I could've just packed up.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.801
But I wanted to see the look in your eye
when I told you that we are done.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.761
You don't do shit for me no more.

24:31.845 --> 24:32.929
Finish him!

24:33.013 --> 24:36.516
I know I was high this morning,
but I swear I told you I sold this car.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.185
-Then what am I keying?
-What you doing?

24:38.268 --> 24:39.561
What's wrong with you?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.855
Go deeper. He can still buff that out.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.232
No, no, no.
He's right. He did sell the car.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.359
Oh, no, bruh. Get out my face.

24:46.443 --> 24:50.197
We ain't doing that
"what had happened" shit no more!

24:50.739 --> 24:53.950
Regina, calm down. Stop now. Freeze!

24:54.034 --> 24:55.577
I had a question on…

24:56.286 --> 24:57.454
-Darlene--
-What the hell?

24:57.537 --> 24:59.206
Oh, you Darlene.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.833
You the one that bought the car.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.419
Well, let me sign your name to it.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.880
Is that with one "N" or two?!

25:07.506 --> 25:10.091
I'm not buying a damn thing now.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.803
Too bad. My girlfriend loves Camaros.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.933
Don't walk away. This is a dream car.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.644
I can fix it. I'll lower the price!

25:21.394 --> 25:23.063
-[door slams]
-Shit.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.233
[exhales sharply]

25:26.316 --> 25:29.903
I know this doesn't help,
but I don't want it anymore either.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.326
You happy now?

25:36.409 --> 25:38.578
-Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
-No, no, no.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.956
But she told me that you… Bennie, wait!

25:41.623 --> 25:42.832
Shit.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.626
[sighs deeply]

25:49.673 --> 25:51.883
You need to work on your trust issues.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.804
That's what got Mama.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.391
Mm-mmm-mmm.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.476
