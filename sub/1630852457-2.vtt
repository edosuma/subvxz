27:19.346 --> 27:21.348
[cell phone rings]

27:23.725 --> 27:24.601
Hello?

27:26.019 --> 27:28.021
No, no, it's just me. Johnny's…

27:29.564 --> 27:30.774
OK, OK, slow down.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.777
All right, I'm on my way.

27:44.954 --> 27:45.830
Excuse me.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.042
I'm not here. Need to clean your dirties,
come back tomorrow.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.087
I'd like to speak with you
about Tory Nichols.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.004
[laughs]

27:53.088 --> 27:55.548
Let me guess, she owes you some money?

27:55.632 --> 27:56.549
Get in line.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.011
No, I'm just a neutral party
looking out for her well-being.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.472
Look, old man, I don't know you.

28:02.555 --> 28:05.642
If you care about her well-being,
you can pay her rent.

28:05.725 --> 28:08.895
Or she can do something else
to get in my good graces.

28:08.978 --> 28:09.813
[groans]

28:10.897 --> 28:11.731
Shit!

28:14.943 --> 28:16.611
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

28:16.695 --> 28:19.531
I'm sorry!
What, are you her grandpa or something?

28:19.614 --> 28:20.907
Or something.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.617
Please, you don't wanna do this.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.496
I think I do. Somebody's gotta teach you
to keep your hands to yourself.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.708
OK, OK, OK!
I'll do what you want! Come on, man!

28:30.417 --> 28:31.292
Good.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.795
We're gonna make a little arrangement.

28:49.144 --> 28:49.978
Hey.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.563
Hey.

28:52.939 --> 28:53.773
I, uh…

28:54.441 --> 28:56.151
keep having to sneak in here.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.405
I kept it from last time I was here.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.991
What happened to your face?

29:03.074 --> 29:05.869
I got into a fight
with a paper towel dispenser.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.122
And a couple goons at a chop shop.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.502
You got rid of that neck brace,
that's good.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.881
I always thought headgear was for nerds.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.345
The doctor told my mom
I might not walk again.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.850
What? No.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.019
They can't know that.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.564
Nah, they don't know how strong you are.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.608
Sensei…

29:39.819 --> 29:41.946
I did what you taught me.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.158
I showed mercy.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.996
Why did this happen to me?

29:56.336 --> 29:57.337
I don't know.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.298
You don't know?

30:04.469 --> 30:05.512
I trusted you.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.391
I did everything that you told me.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.436
Miguel… I--

30:13.520 --> 30:14.604
Look at me!

30:22.570 --> 30:25.031
-[sobbing] Get out of here.
-Miguel, you can't--

30:25.114 --> 30:25.990
Just get out!

30:27.575 --> 30:28.535
Please!

30:29.786 --> 30:32.038
Just leave. [sobs]

30:38.545 --> 30:40.171
[Shan] It's gonna be OK, Robby.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.341
We'll figure this out.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.093
I promise.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.224
I'll be right back, OK?

30:51.975 --> 30:53.685
Just keep eating.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.564
-Is he OK?
-He's not right, Daniel.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.858
He's talking like he's gonna leave town.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.193
-Please, you have to help him.
-I will.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.779
-But you gotta trust me here, all right?
-OK.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.864
We'll fix this.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.496
[Daniel] Hey.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.252
[Daniel sighs]

31:21.588 --> 31:22.422
Nice cut.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.594
Sorry you've been stuck
clearing up my mess.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.348
I'll pay you back for the van. I…

31:33.099 --> 31:35.810
I didn't think
that van was your style anyway.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.275
I know it must've been rough
on your own out there.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.319
Is Sam OK?

31:45.570 --> 31:46.529
She's…

31:47.989 --> 31:48.990
worried about you.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.784
We all are.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.078
Your dad too.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.209
Robby, I need to apologize to you.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.879
But I caused all this. I kicked Miguel--

32:02.962 --> 32:05.632
I know you blame yourself,
but I let you down.

32:06.966 --> 32:10.178
What I said to you the last time
we saw each other was…

32:11.262 --> 32:12.096
terrible.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.891
-I'm so sorry.
-You were right.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.393
It's a mistake to help me.
I can't change.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.062
We all make mistakes, Robby.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.190
But our mistakes aren't who we are.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.109
You could learn from your mistakes.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.736
And I'll help you with that.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.322
I will.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.033
Listen…

32:33.493 --> 32:36.245
This next part
is gonna be really, really hard, OK?

32:36.913 --> 32:38.873
But this is the best way forward.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.460
I spoke to a lawyer
and he explained that it's--

32:42.543 --> 32:44.504
[police radio chattering]

32:49.175 --> 32:51.511
-What did you do?
-Told them you'd turn yourself in.

32:51.594 --> 32:54.555
-The sentence will be much lighter.
-No, I can't!

32:54.639 --> 32:57.517
-You can. You have to.
-You kept me talking so I didn't leave.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.352
No, I was trying to help you.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.437
Hey. Hey! Easy with him!

33:02.897 --> 33:06.401
Robby, this is only temporary.
I will get you through this, OK?

33:07.443 --> 33:09.570
I will visit you every day, I promise.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.032
Don't bother.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.705
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.623
I promise.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.752
We are only as strong
as our weakest links.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.630
When we remove these links,

33:27.714 --> 33:29.507
this is what's left.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.968
We are one unit.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.346
With one united purpose.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.931
[door opening]

33:41.644 --> 33:42.603
Nichols.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.147
Welcome back.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.106
Thanks.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.693
That issue I was having…

33:49.652 --> 33:50.570
got worked out.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.196
That right?

33:55.408 --> 33:57.201
Fall in. We've got work to do.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.000
Forward strike.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.376
Ready?

34:06.335 --> 34:07.795
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:07.879 --> 34:09.255
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:09.338 --> 34:10.757
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:10.840 --> 34:12.258
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:12.341 --> 34:13.634
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:13.718 --> 34:15.303
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:15.386 --> 34:16.804
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:16.888 --> 34:18.139
-Ai!
-Kyo!

34:19.766 --> 34:23.269
-I don't think I can handle this.
-It's just basic training.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.188
You know what I mean.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.399
But no matter what, I'll wait for you.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.194
Promise you'll come back to me?

34:33.362 --> 34:34.614
I promise, doll face.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.743
I'll be coming back a hero.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.046
[Kreese] Your whole life,
you're told to be good.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.341
But good is only a matter of perspective.

34:54.675 --> 34:58.304
Always remember your enemies think
they're doing what's right.

34:58.387 --> 35:01.641
They think they're the hero
and you're the villain.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.060
But now you know the truth.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.436
There is no good.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.605
There is no bad.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.482
Only weak…

35:10.024 --> 35:11.025
or strong.

35:11.818 --> 35:14.028
And now that we've shed our weakness,

35:14.529 --> 35:16.405
it's time to show our strength.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.867
If you do that,

35:20.868 --> 35:22.078
I promise you…

35:23.830 --> 35:25.540
you will be unstoppable.
