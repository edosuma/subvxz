WEBVTT

00:06.799 --> 00:10.678
I anoint you Dumnonia's ruler
and Britain's defender!

00:10.761 --> 00:12.304
[cheers]

00:12.388 --> 00:13.764
[Arthur] You have a daughter.

00:13.848 --> 00:16.267
Let us be joined
in marriage. An alliance.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.144
[Gundleus] All this for him.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.229
Why doesn't my uncle see
his ambition?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.273
Arthur is good for us.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.484
[Arthur] One moment
I want to be with you,

00:25.568 --> 00:28.362
the next I don't.
Then when I see you...

00:29.655 --> 00:31.574
I can't stop looking at you.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.660
No. We're betraying Ceinwyn.

00:34.744 --> 00:38.164
-I don't care.
-Gorfydd will.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.458
My father's clever
and cunning.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.293
He's beginning to work out
what's happening.

00:43.544 --> 00:47.173
[Ladwys] Arthur's man Derfel
survived a death pit.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.758
Your death pit.

00:50.509 --> 00:53.512
[battle-cries]

00:53.596 --> 00:56.098
Your life is in danger.
We have to go.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.350
[Gorfydd] Arthur has
run away with Guinevere.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.102
There's work to be done.

01:00.186 --> 01:02.104
[Arthur] You must enter
Dumnonia as my wife.

01:02.188 --> 01:04.482
Marry us. Here. Now.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.442
[Sansum] To the family
of the Holy Church.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.152
May the Lord forgive you both
for what you've done.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.238
[rousing music]

01:22.792 --> 01:25.586
[gentle music]

01:59.328 --> 02:01.329
[soft panting]

02:16.428 --> 02:18.430
[both panting]

02:31.944 --> 02:34.655
[gasping]

02:49.962 --> 02:53.382
I'm used to waking up
on grass, not soft fur.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.511
And it's usually
Sag's grouchy face

02:57.595 --> 02:59.179
that wakes me up
in the morning.

02:59.263 --> 03:02.808
[laugh] I hope
I'm a worthy substitute.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.643
Mm.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.520
[knocking on door]

03:08.564 --> 03:18.656
One moment!

03:18.741 --> 03:21.201
Are my wife and I
to have no privacy?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.664
Forgive the intrusion.

03:25.748 --> 03:28.459
You are needed
in the Great Hall.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.836
Right this second?
Can't it wait?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.838
I dealt with what I could
while you were in Powys,

03:32.922 --> 03:35.007
but you have been back
for a week.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.259
Half of Dumnonia is waiting
for you in the courtyard

03:37.343 --> 03:38.844
to have their
petitions heard.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.642
People need their leader.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.356
Cadwys is also here.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.857
What does he want?

03:53.524 --> 03:54.985
Perhaps he's here
to congratulate you

03:55.069 --> 03:56.695
on your marriage.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.864
Then I should be there
to welcome him too.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.414
We should probably
get dressed first.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.334
[Arthur] Hm.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.756
[laughing]

04:17.925 --> 04:20.928
[up-tempo music]

04:34.066 --> 04:36.026
What kind of a man is Cadwys?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.571
Uther allowed him
to rule Isca.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.615
That land belongs
to Dumnonia.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.076
So, Cadwys is a king
without a kingdom.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.536
To lose your lands is to lose

04:45.619 --> 04:46.996
a piece of yourself.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.998
It's heartbreaking.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.041
Humiliating.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.876
Cadwys wants respect.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.547
Hm.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.851
Huh.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.395
Good of you to join us.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.439
It is my fault
we were detained, my Lord.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.482
My sincere apologies.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.818
Allow me
to introduce my wife,

05:17.901 --> 05:20.446
Lady Guinevere,
of Henis Wyren.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.448
[Guinevere]
I'm honored, King Cadwys.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.949
Tales of your people's
skill and bravery

05:24.033 --> 05:25.492
are heard far and wide.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.079
Let me get you a drink.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.586
Rejecting Gorfydd's
pretty daughter, eh?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.671
You've got more balls
than I thought.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.925
Though I am beginning
to understand why you did it.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.057
What can I do
for you, Cadwys?

05:49.475 --> 05:50.934
Owain is dead.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.687
Which means
King Mordred has lost

05:53.771 --> 05:55.355
one of his three protectors.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.066
I want to serve
in Owain's place.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.027
Consider it
a sign of friendship

06:00.110 --> 06:02.905
between Isca and Dumnonia.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.745
A very generous offer.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.083
But surely we need
no such formalities.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.170
Knowing you look after Isca
on Dumnonia's behalf

06:18.253 --> 06:20.005
is service enough.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.095
King Cadwys.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.482
Nice to be home.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.983
[Culwyn]
Hey, look at this.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.902
A warrior come to visit us.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.698
Ah! [laugh]

06:46.782 --> 06:49.409
Oh! Look at you!

06:49.493 --> 06:51.578
What have they done to you?

06:52.955 --> 06:55.457
Do they not feed
their guests in Powys?

06:55.541 --> 06:57.543
You have to be fast to beat
Lanval to the good stuff.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.462
[laughing]
Hey, come here.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.131
-You okay?
-Yeah.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.091
So, is it true?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.051
Arthur's returned
with the wrong bride.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.928
[laughing]

07:08.010 --> 07:10.472
Arthur said
that a good leader

07:10.556 --> 07:12.099
must follow his heart

07:12.182 --> 07:14.058
and what he knows
to be the truth.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.936
I've found
that men tell themselves

07:16.019 --> 07:18.939
all sorts of things
to justify their actions.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.150
Particularly
when it comes to women.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.736
Arthur isn't like that.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.155
I'm teasing.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.115
If marrying Guinevere is
what Arthur wants,

07:28.198 --> 07:30.576
then it must be the will
of the Gods. [laugh]

07:30.659 --> 07:32.161
But I am surprised
Bedwin agreed to him

07:32.244 --> 07:34.163
breaking his oath
to marry the princess.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.624
He didn't. It was Sansum
who performed the ceremony.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.627
Sansum is a zealot.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.589
He'd see every pagan banished,

07:43.672 --> 07:45.007
or killed.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.677
Do not underestimate him,
Derfel.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.804
I'm not afraid of Sansum.

07:57.853 --> 07:58.896
[Arthur] Good day.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.530
My Lord, my Ladies.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.950
I hope you and your wife are
well this morning.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.623
God bless this happy union.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.750
To think I...
I'll be able to boast

08:19.833 --> 08:22.044
that I was the one
who joined you together

08:22.127 --> 08:23.670
-in matrimony.
-We're very grateful.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.047
And I am humbled, my Lord,

08:25.130 --> 08:26.590
and if you ever need
my services...

08:26.673 --> 08:27.883
[Guinevere] Most generous.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.677
[Sansum] Ahh.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.764
There is, um...

08:33.847 --> 08:36.808
one other matter
to discuss, my Lord.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.811
Certain... assurances

08:39.895 --> 08:41.813
were made by your good self

08:41.897 --> 08:44.691
towards the Christian
community I serve.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.529
I believe we discussed
the building of a church.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.243
We did.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.789
We'll look
into suitable sites.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.874
My Lord, if I may, I...

09:01.917 --> 09:04.795
I have proposed a site already.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.048
[clears throat]

09:12.094 --> 09:13.971
It's that of
the Sacred Thorn Bush.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.056
-In Avalon?
-It's near Avalon,

09:16.139 --> 09:18.266
not in the village itself,
my Lord.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.102
-No, Arthur...
-The land is flat,

09:20.185 --> 09:22.187
it's easy to work,

09:22.271 --> 09:25.607
protected from
the harshest of elements.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.777
There's a well nearby.
Fresh water.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.197
We simply wish to worship
in peace, Lady Morgan...

09:33.782 --> 09:35.242
and in a place
hallowed in our faith

09:35.325 --> 09:37.077
as much as it is your own.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.082
Mm.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.088
Perhaps my Lord and Lady

09:48.171 --> 09:49.881
would do us
the great honor of attending

09:49.965 --> 09:53.051
-our very first mass.
-Good day to you, Sansum.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.636
And good day to you.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.099
Peace be with you.
God be present.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.060
Do you smell that?

10:02.144 --> 10:04.771
It's the stench
of naked ambition.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.316
I gave him my word
he could build his church.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.069
My word must count
for something.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.280
[Morgan laughs]

10:15.991 --> 10:18.035
You have something
to say to me, sister?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.789
I have to go see Mordred.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.839
Perhaps I could
come with you.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.385
I'd like to meet
the Edling King.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.228
I'm glad to have you
as my guide.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.939
It'll take me an age to learn
which passageway leads to which.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.900
It's not that difficult.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.944
Arthur says you're a woman
of great intelligence.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.780
Is intelligence
a virtue or a curse

10:54.863 --> 10:56.406
in the body of a woman?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.872
[babble]

11:03.955 --> 11:05.749
He bites.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.878
-[crying]
-[shushing]

11:15.509 --> 11:17.302
You're good with him.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.722
He was hard to soothe
after his mother died.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.057
But he's grown used to me.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.850
He can be
an angry little fellow.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.936
And with plenty of reason.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.898
He's a poor motherless
little mite.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.235
He is a king.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.490
Fetch a lotion of ivy bark
and honeysuckle

11:38.573 --> 11:40.283
to soothe his gums.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.872
I know what you think of me.

11:45.956 --> 11:49.126
I have no land, no title,
nothing to my name.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.295
Perhaps I only married Arthur
to give myself a better life.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.762
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.264
I love your brother.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.142
It's true,
I am an outcast,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.185
just like he is.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.938
That is why
we understand each other.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.025
You think
you understand my brother?

12:14.109 --> 12:17.779
We have much to learn
about one another.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.739
But I know this.

12:20.615 --> 12:24.453
You and I,
we can be enemies or friends.

12:25.454 --> 12:28.123
But Arthur will need us both.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.172
Morgan is protective of me.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.466
Always has been.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.302
It's one of the many things
I admire about her.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.763
You may admire my sister...

12:45.891 --> 12:48.185
but can we enjoy
some time alone...

12:49.394 --> 12:51.855
without her
bursting in on us?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.332
What are you thinking about?

13:14.586 --> 13:17.297
What our future might look like.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.346
In 15 years,

13:24.429 --> 13:26.556
Mordred will come of age,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.975
and you and I can get
a nice place

13:29.059 --> 13:30.435
somewhere...

13:30.519 --> 13:32.479
far away
from everyone.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.941
Where we can raise sheep,

13:36.024 --> 13:38.485
cattle, chickens,

13:38.568 --> 13:40.153
our children.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.407
And how many of each
are you planning?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.451
As many as
you will allow me.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.040
You see yourself
as a farmer?

13:53.708 --> 13:56.127
Do you think that foolish?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.296
I think it unlikely.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.425
It's beautiful though,
isn't it?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.345
Dumnonia?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.477
One's homeland always is.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.396
You're thinking
of Henis Wyren.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.481
I'd always thought
my destiny

14:16.565 --> 14:18.942
would be to return
there someday.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.986
Perhaps it is.

14:21.069 --> 14:24.155
And perhaps your destiny is
sheep, cattle, and chickens.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.160
We'll make the most of whatever
the Gods have planned for us.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.496
As long as
our fates lie together.

14:44.134 --> 14:47.137
[choral music]

15:07.782 --> 15:09.242
Sansum.

15:10.201 --> 15:13.246
This isn't your land.
You shouldn't be here.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.916
Do not the pagans believe
the land belongs

15:17.000 --> 15:18.585
to everyone, Nimue?

15:18.668 --> 15:20.378
With some exceptions.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.589
Of course.
With exception.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.552
Lord Arthur gave us
permission to build a church.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.596
He sees
our Christian community

15:29.679 --> 15:31.264
is thriving.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.060
He agrees we deserve
a place to worship, Nimue.

15:35.143 --> 15:38.521
And they say
he serves no god,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.357
but perhaps they were wrong.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.235
Hear us our Lord, have mercy
because we sin against thee.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.365
[all] Hear us
our Lord, have mercy

15:48.448 --> 15:50.075
because we sin against thee.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.286
God bless you, Nimue.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.414
[Christians] Hear us
our Lord, have mercy...

15:56.498 --> 15:59.584
One! Two!

15:59.668 --> 16:01.628
Three! Four!

16:02.837 --> 16:05.256
[effort grunts]

16:05.340 --> 16:07.509
You have a blind spot
on your right side.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.219
I'll work on it, my Lord.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.054
You did very well, Derfel.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.640
My husband likes
to show off.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.520
I see your wife has
the measure of you.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.065
You did well to find
so many recruits so quickly.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.109
How are they coming along?

16:24.192 --> 16:26.152
We've a long way to go.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.696
I'm sure you'll whip them
into shape.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.322
Like I did you.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.159
[guard] Rider approaching!

16:44.420 --> 16:46.381
I heard there was
a messenger from Kernow.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.550
Cadwys has taken the mine
on the moors by force

16:48.632 --> 16:50.427
and enslaved
the Kernow miners.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.094
He has also declared Isca

16:52.178 --> 16:53.680
-an independent state.
-[clatter]

16:53.763 --> 16:55.431
We'll ride to the mine
and take it back?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.600
We won't get that far.
Cadwys knows

16:57.684 --> 17:00.186
I can't ignore this.
He expects me to respond.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.731
- He'll be waiting for us.
- You anticipate an ambush?

17:02.814 --> 17:05.650
No, he wants me
to see him as a king.

17:05.734 --> 17:08.194
He won't hide out of sight;
he'll be in open land.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.407
Proud.
Get the men ready.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.200
I know this territory,
my Lord.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.828
I could lead the men in.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.205
I need a man here
who I can trust.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.541
You'll stay to guard
Lady Guinevere and Lady Morgan.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.168
[Morgan]
What if we hear from Bedwin?

17:23.251 --> 17:24.711
He's negotiating in Powys.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.796
What happens if we receive
Gorfydd's demands?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.715
I won't be gone long.
If Powys send word,

17:28.798 --> 17:31.301
-wait for my return.
-No, Gorfydd won't

17:31.384 --> 17:33.636
-be kept waiting, Arthur--
-You have my instructions.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.556
Be careful.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.618
Please tell me
why you've allowed

17:56.701 --> 17:58.703
that Christian fool
to build his church at Avalon.

17:58.787 --> 18:02.081
They are entitled
to a place to worship, Nimue.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.794
He offends
the Gods, Arthur.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.504
If Britain is to have peace,

18:07.587 --> 18:09.547
we must all learn
to live together.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.716
Pagans and Christians.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.302
-Yes...
-Nimue.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.596
You must try
to get along with Sansum.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.577
Did Lady Morgan say
why she wanted to see me?

18:39.661 --> 18:41.538
No, my Lady.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.122
I'm quite safe
within the walls

18:43.206 --> 18:44.541
of Caer Cadarn, Derfel.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.252
I swore to Arthur
that I would protect you.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.795
I protected myself
for a long time

18:48.878 --> 18:50.421
before I met Arthur.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.302
-Sometimes I wish I was a man.
-You do?

18:56.386 --> 18:58.513
Then I'd be out there
doing something,

18:58.596 --> 19:01.432
not left behind
waiting for news.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.227
You don't have to be a woman
to be left behind.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.437
Arthur clearly
cares for you a great deal.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.731
Perhaps he wants
to protect us both.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.817
[soft chuckle]

19:15.530 --> 19:17.866
[soft chatter]

19:17.949 --> 19:19.701
[Guinevere]
What is this?

19:19.784 --> 19:22.704
Word has come from Powys.
Bishop Bedwin's negotiations

19:22.787 --> 19:25.707
with Gorfydd's abbot at Ratae
have concluded.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.418
Powys has named its price.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.169
Have the guards load the gold.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.796
I'll convey it
to Gorfydd immediately.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.381
Arthur said we should wait
for him to return.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.842
We have no idea
when that might be,

19:35.925 --> 19:37.760
and Gorfydd is not
a patient man.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.804
Nor is he a man to be trusted.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.807
Well, the request was
confirmed by Bishop Bedwin.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.351
-He sent this with it.
-Still, I--

19:45.435 --> 19:47.645
I governed successfully
when Arthur was in Powys,

19:47.729 --> 19:49.522
and without your counsel.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.735
Do you think to question
my decisions now, my Lady?

19:53.818 --> 19:57.989
Hm? I am going to Powys
to give Gorfydd his gold,

19:58.072 --> 20:00.575
and I will bring Bedwin home.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.746
Friendship with Gorfydd is
a necessary evil in our battle

20:04.829 --> 20:09.292
with the Saxons, but it is
an evil nonetheless.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.919
I have dealt
with Gorfydd before.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.338
Then you know he reserves
a special manipulation

20:13.421 --> 20:14.672
and cruelty for women.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.507
However strong
that woman may be,

20:16.591 --> 20:19.260
it's her very strength
that riles him.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.764
I could lead
your guard, my Lady.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.268
I'm-I'm going
in peace, Derfel.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.229
A large guard will send
the wrong message.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.607
Perhaps, but take Derfel.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.944
A large guard
in just one man.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.576
Prepare the horses.
We leave at first light.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.962
[eerie music]

21:11.813 --> 21:14.649
[choral music]

21:20.989 --> 21:23.032
[whispering]
I need your help.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.535
I need your help.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.578
Please.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.664
Tell me what to do.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.040
Please.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.292
[choral music]

21:42.969 --> 21:47.598
[screaming]

21:47.682 --> 21:49.726
Please!

21:51.978 --> 21:53.813
Almighty God...

21:55.648 --> 21:57.608
with you always.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.618
[thunder rumbling]

22:07.702 --> 22:09.704
[gasp]

22:26.137 --> 22:28.931
I have heard you...

22:29.015 --> 22:30.767
and I will act.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.813
Close your eyes,
brothers, quick.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.775
Oh God, we beseech thee,

22:38.858 --> 22:40.985
that we be made fit,

22:41.069 --> 22:43.446
be clean of heart
and innocent of works,

22:43.529 --> 22:47.075
worthy to receive
the most sacred body...

22:50.703 --> 22:52.872
Ah. Here.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.750
We welcome you, Nimue.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.385
And dare we hope you've come
to worship our dear Lord?

23:08.554 --> 23:10.807
If you make
one more mark

23:10.890 --> 23:13.976
upon this sacred ground,
you will suffer.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.146
You will rot
from the inside out,

23:17.230 --> 23:20.525
just as you attempt
to rot the faith of our Gods,

23:20.608 --> 23:23.444
and you will know
their wrath.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.113
Nimue, I am here.

23:26.531 --> 23:30.785
[laughing]

23:30.868 --> 23:33.121
We have a heathen witch,
brothers.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.917
And your charms
and your stones, Nimue,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.710
they hold no power over us.

23:39.794 --> 23:43.881
So, I implore thee,
Lord Almighty,

23:43.965 --> 23:47.051
let this holy communion be
the armor of my faith,

23:47.135 --> 23:50.638
and may it be my sure defense
against my enemies.

23:51.848 --> 23:56.060
Your powerless God offers you
no defense against me and mine.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.104
Nimue, I think
you should leave.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.150
[thunder rumbling]

24:12.243 --> 24:14.787
May... May it...
May it make me

24:14.871 --> 24:17.915
ever cleave to thee
who art the one true God.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.126
And-And may I owe it

24:20.209 --> 24:22.753
the happy ending
of my life.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.463
Amen, brothers.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.882
-[Christians] Amen.
-Amen.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.592
One more mark.

24:53.618 --> 24:55.203
[horse nickering]

24:55.286 --> 24:57.038
[Arthur]
They're ready for us.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.624
[Sagramor]
And we are ready for them.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.224
[Cadwys] You've just
crossed the border

25:16.307 --> 25:19.644
into the independent
Kingdom of Isca.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.187
Isn't she lovely?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.147
[Arthur] This land is
part of Dumnonia,

25:23.231 --> 25:25.233
covered by
the long-standing agreement

25:25.316 --> 25:26.984
between you and my father.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.695
Uther is dead,
and lately I've been struggling

25:29.779 --> 25:32.114
to see the benefits
of that old agreement.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.959
Then you are to be arrested
for breaking the terms

25:43.042 --> 25:44.627
of the treaty.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.714
On whose authority?

25:49.924 --> 25:53.052
-Yours?
-Yes.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.680
Let's not make
this difficult, Cadwys.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.976
None of our men need
to die here today.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.858
Just me or you then.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.861
You swore an oath
to the Edling King.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.739
[laugh]

26:13.823 --> 26:16.284
He still claims
to act for Mordred.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.869
Is that what this is about?

26:18.953 --> 26:21.038
Because I wouldn't name you
his protector?

26:21.122 --> 26:23.249
Ahh... you forget...

26:24.750 --> 26:26.711
I was there
when you asked your father

26:26.794 --> 26:31.090
to be named the same.
I saw him deny you.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.634
The old king had barely crossed
into the other world

26:33.718 --> 26:36.178
before you were back,
claiming it anyway,

26:36.262 --> 26:38.848
coveting, begging,

26:38.931 --> 26:40.391
conniving,

26:40.474 --> 26:42.727
getting rid of those
your father did honor.

26:42.810 --> 26:46.397
Bedwin off fixing
your messes in Powys.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.984
Owain, ahh.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.778
I saw that too.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.781
Is there nothing
you won't do for power?

27:00.411 --> 27:02.371
Surrender, Cadwys.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.123
Oh...

27:06.375 --> 27:08.336
[grunting]

27:08.419 --> 27:10.212
There he is!

27:29.940 --> 27:33.903
[grunting]

27:40.326 --> 27:43.454
There was a lot
Uther was wrong about...

27:43.537 --> 27:45.373
but he was right about you.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.335
He saw you
for what you really are.

27:51.545 --> 27:54.090
A treacherous bastard!

27:57.093 --> 27:58.177
[groans]

28:00.012 --> 28:02.139
You will come
to Caer Cadarn,

28:02.223 --> 28:05.935
and you will answer
for what you have done.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.396
You say you won't wanna rule--
that you're just a caretaker

28:08.479 --> 28:10.856
for your crippled brother...

28:10.940 --> 28:12.983
but I see you
for what you really are too.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.864
[laughing]

28:21.784 --> 28:23.452
Enough!

28:25.830 --> 28:27.832
You will surrender, Cadwys.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.002
Surrender.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.141
The bastard
who would be king.

28:56.485 --> 28:59.071
[gurgling]

29:18.215 --> 29:21.218
[music]

29:57.087 --> 29:58.547
[distant coughing, retching]

29:58.631 --> 30:01.425
[Brother John]
They fell to a fever.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.093
The pox.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.595
They bear no marks.

30:04.678 --> 30:09.225
The disease is... within.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.228
What?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.896
No.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.899
No, the witch's curse
has no power.

30:16.982 --> 30:20.319
She has no power here.
Right?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.463
Here you are.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.889
How much further?

30:50.641 --> 30:53.852
We rested here on the way north
with Lord Arthur.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.566
Caer Dolforwyn was
a further day's ride.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.443
That's a long way to go
to make a mistake.

31:04.071 --> 31:08.117
If anyone is allowed
to criticize Arthur, it's me.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.082
Do you think
that he was wrong...

31:16.208 --> 31:17.626
to marry Lady Guinevere?

31:19.086 --> 31:21.380
Arthur always does
what he thinks is right.

31:22.423 --> 31:25.426
Even if that means
choosing the hardest path.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.513
And with him, it often does.

31:29.597 --> 31:32.558
He makes thinks so hard
for himself, Derfel.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.061
But is he right?

31:36.145 --> 31:38.397
Well, he has been so far.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.483
That's why he's so annoying.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.277
[laugh]

31:44.737 --> 31:48.198
Over and over, I have
watched my brother succeed

31:48.282 --> 31:50.534
when everyone thought
he would fail.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.455
So...

31:54.538 --> 31:57.207
if he believes
that marrying Guinevere

31:57.291 --> 32:00.085
is the right course, then...

32:00.169 --> 32:02.046
I must, too.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.923
I mean, we all must.

32:14.516 --> 32:17.394
[choral music]

32:29.323 --> 32:31.742
Let the light shine
perpetually upon them,

32:31.825 --> 32:34.578
and, through the mercy of God,
may their souls rest in peace.

32:34.662 --> 32:36.205
Amen.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.042
Amen, brother.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.627
[Christians] Amen.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.631
Is there something
you want to say?

32:47.257 --> 32:48.509
Hm?

32:50.344 --> 32:53.430
-The witch has cursed us.
-[laughing]

32:53.514 --> 32:55.349
We are all going to die.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.393
This is not a curse.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.479
Now, she poisoned them,

33:00.562 --> 33:02.356
she murdered them,

33:02.439 --> 33:04.733
and I will make sure
she is punished for it.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.444
Do you trust me?

33:10.823 --> 33:12.491
I will make sure.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.543
[panting]

33:26.547 --> 33:29.758
[distant chanting]

33:35.597 --> 33:37.725
[all] Forgive us
our Lord, have mercy,

33:37.808 --> 33:40.144
because we've sinned
against thee.

33:40.227 --> 33:41.645
[all] Forgive us
our Lord, have mercy.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.313
There she is, brothers!

33:43.397 --> 33:46.023
Nimue! You see?

33:46.108 --> 33:48.443
The will of God is with us.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.742
Come out, Nimue,
and face justice.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.369
[Nimue screaming]

33:59.829 --> 34:02.750
What are you doing here?
Get away from there!

34:02.833 --> 34:05.251
You are harboring a murderer.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.045
She poisoned my men,

34:07.128 --> 34:09.338
and three of them are dead,

34:09.423 --> 34:10.673
and I will take her
to Caer Cadarn,

34:10.758 --> 34:12.217
where she will
confess her sins

34:12.300 --> 34:13.343
and she will be punished.

34:13.427 --> 34:14.845
You lay a finger on Nimue,

34:14.928 --> 34:17.681
-you'll regret it.
-Brothers...

34:17.765 --> 34:19.224
I'm going to fetch Arthur.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.143
You bring him.
You bring him here

34:21.226 --> 34:23.479
so he can see
what the druidess has done.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.230
You go!

34:28.233 --> 34:30.486
-[whispering]
-[snakes hissing]

34:32.154 --> 34:34.364
[man] Oh, dear God.

34:34.448 --> 34:37.743
-[whispering]
-[snakes hissing]

34:37.826 --> 34:39.578
Sweet Christ.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.832
She's completely mad, brothers.

34:45.626 --> 34:48.754
We cast fire from heaven.
We cast it now!

34:48.837 --> 34:50.714
[hissing]

34:50.798 --> 34:53.801
[men screaming]

34:57.679 --> 34:59.556
[screaming]

34:59.640 --> 35:00.808
Please!

35:01.975 --> 35:03.644
[shrieks]

35:09.900 --> 35:12.236
[ominous choral music]

35:14.446 --> 35:16.406
You will face justice, Nimue.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.743
You will face justice
for this!

35:26.416 --> 35:28.544
[guard] Open the gates!

35:43.267 --> 35:46.436
My Lady. Derfel.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.355
[laugh]

35:48.438 --> 35:49.815
Oh.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.900
[Bedwin sighing]

35:51.984 --> 35:53.569
[chuckling]

35:55.237 --> 35:56.655
[sighing]

35:57.656 --> 35:59.616
Strange circumstances.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.579
It's a blessing
to see your face.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.914
I thought you were in Ratae.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.375
I-I was.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.711
And then the abbot
and I came here

36:10.794 --> 36:12.588
to speak directly
with Gorfydd.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.174
Negotiations have
been... protracted.

36:16.258 --> 36:18.802
-[soft laugh]
-But I've been treated well.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.471
-Good.
-How was your journey?

36:23.015 --> 36:24.766
Long.
[laughing]

36:24.850 --> 36:26.894
But Derfel was
an excellent guide.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.521
I always knew
this boy was a good one.

36:32.983 --> 36:36.904
[Gorfydd]
I am told we have visitors!

36:36.987 --> 36:40.490
[laughing]

36:40.574 --> 36:42.910
We were expecting
your brother, my Lady.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.412
Arthur has been
detained in the west,

36:45.495 --> 36:47.497
but he sends his apologies.

36:47.581 --> 36:48.916
I'm here on his behalf.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.795
Your bishop here is
a very impressive negotiator.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.505
Not many would be
brave enough to stay behind

36:55.589 --> 36:57.549
to fix your brother's messes.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.262
Derfel, go get the gold.

37:02.346 --> 37:04.681
He's wasted in the church.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.516
I offered him
a place on my council,

37:06.600 --> 37:08.852
-and he turned me down.
-[laughter]

37:08.936 --> 37:11.521
Sadly, my services
belong to another.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.565
Oh, belong to another.

37:13.649 --> 37:16.276
Sense of humor
too, eh? Eh?

37:16.360 --> 37:17.945
Perhaps I'll keep him anyway.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.238
My Lord.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.282
Now, you go
count the gold,

37:22.366 --> 37:24.409
make sure
everything is in order.

37:24.493 --> 37:25.702
Of course.

37:28.789 --> 37:32.709
And meanwhile, I'm sure
you'd like to freshen up.

37:32.793 --> 37:36.546
Tonight, there will be
a feast in your honor.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.757
That's very generous,
but, really,

37:38.840 --> 37:40.425
-it won't be necessary.
-No, no, no, no, no.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.052
Powys prides herself
for her hospitality

37:42.135 --> 37:43.762
to friends.

37:46.807 --> 37:50.477
And we are friends...
are we not?

37:50.560 --> 37:51.728
[Morgan] Of course.

38:00.487 --> 38:03.490
[music]

38:26.096 --> 38:28.598
[approaching footsteps]

38:28.682 --> 38:30.517
[Guinevere]
I heard you were back.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.814
What happened?

38:41.111 --> 38:43.321
Cadwys is dead.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.823
I killed him.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.996
You did what you had to do.

38:58.128 --> 39:01.006
I wanted to deal
with the situation peacefully.

39:03.592 --> 39:08.972
I gave him chance...
after chance...

39:10.849 --> 39:12.851
but he refused to surrender.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.857
He said I only want
to take power for myself.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.486
But it was him who sought power.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.696
Cadwys made his choice.

39:25.906 --> 39:27.783
He would've ripped
this country apart

39:27.866 --> 39:29.576
and threatened the peace
that you've been working

39:29.659 --> 39:31.369
so hard to achieve.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.794
We received word
from Bishop Bedwin.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.797
Gorfydd named
his price in gold.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.805
I need to respond
immediately.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.515
Morgan insisted
on leaving for Powys

39:51.598 --> 39:53.642
as soon as
we received the message.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.524
I told you
to wait for me.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.651
I'm not your sister's keeper.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.946
Derfel went with her.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.490
She's a strong woman, Arthur.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.089
Come to bed, my love.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.551
You must be exhausted.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.517
Arthur.

40:37.853 --> 40:40.522
There's trouble, at Avalon.

40:52.993 --> 40:55.745
Come.
She's inside.

40:55.829 --> 40:57.789
-Is she hurt?
-No.

40:57.873 --> 41:01.126
-Where is Sansum?
-He's at his camp. But--

41:01.209 --> 41:02.836
Thank you.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.673
-You all right?
-Yeah.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.718
[baby wailing]

41:11.136 --> 41:13.138
[soft chatter]

41:16.224 --> 41:18.059
How do you feel?

41:37.913 --> 41:39.664
My Lord.

41:48.632 --> 41:51.009
Nimue did this, my Lord.

42:01.228 --> 42:03.021
You're injured.

42:03.104 --> 42:06.191
She cast fire and serpents
upon us, my Lord.

42:06.274 --> 42:08.860
Thank God
I am-- I am still alive.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.781
Do you have any proof
that Nimue is responsible

42:12.864 --> 42:15.283
-for the deaths?
-She cursed us.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.619
Swore that if we continued
to build our church,

42:17.702 --> 42:20.830
then... then we would rot
from the inside.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.750
The next day,
my men succumbed,

42:23.833 --> 42:25.710
first to fever,
then to death.

42:26.753 --> 42:31.216
Surely you do not hold faith
in the power of a curse, bishop.

42:31.299 --> 42:33.176
I do not, my Lord.

42:33.260 --> 42:36.346
I believe she poisoned them,
and she must be stopped.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.640
Punished, once and for all.

42:43.770 --> 42:46.940
I will speak
with her, alone.

42:47.023 --> 42:49.276
She wants this chaos,
my Lord.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.319
And people only turn
to her false Gods

42:51.403 --> 42:53.822
when they're afraid,
or when they're in the dark.

42:54.948 --> 42:57.075
Christianity is light,

42:57.158 --> 42:58.743
commitment.

42:59.995 --> 43:01.871
You have a choice,
my Lord.

43:01.955 --> 43:04.249
You-- You have a choice.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.960
You can have
the well-ordered,

43:07.043 --> 43:09.337
peaceful Britain
that you seek with my faith.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.674
Or you can have blood
and disorder with hers.

43:16.136 --> 43:18.263
I do not wish
to burden you, my Lord.

43:30.317 --> 43:32.027
How was your wedding?

43:32.110 --> 43:33.903
It's been the talk
of Avalon.

43:33.987 --> 43:36.906
Really? Not the three
dead Christians?

43:41.286 --> 43:43.121
Would you leave us, Ralla?

43:49.794 --> 43:51.755
Do you know
what happened to those men?

43:51.838 --> 43:53.923
I know they shouldn't
have been here.

43:55.425 --> 43:58.303
Sansum accuses you of murder.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.765
Sansum... wants me dead.

44:01.848 --> 44:04.100
Then tell me
you had nothing to do with it,

44:04.184 --> 44:05.935
and I can deal with him.

44:06.019 --> 44:08.104
Like you dealt
with Gundleus?

44:11.149 --> 44:12.942
Did you poison those men?

44:13.026 --> 44:14.903
I cursed them.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.905
If they fell sick
and then died,

44:16.988 --> 44:18.448
then that is
the will of the Gods.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.367
Don't play with words.
I cannot defend

44:20.450 --> 44:23.161
your innocence
if you refuse to deny it.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.790
Only the Gods can judge me.

44:28.541 --> 44:31.002
There must be order, Nimue.

44:32.379 --> 44:34.798
How can we defeat the Saxons
if cannot find peace

44:34.881 --> 44:37.217
amongst ourselves?

44:37.300 --> 44:39.302
Precisely.

44:39.386 --> 44:41.763
Britain suffers
from two sicknesses though,

44:41.846 --> 44:43.348
Arthur,
and you only see one.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.809
Even if you do
defeat the Saxons,

44:45.892 --> 44:48.103
it will not matter.
Not if you allow

44:48.186 --> 44:50.480
the Christians to rise up
and drive the Gods

44:50.563 --> 44:52.315
to desert us.

44:52.399 --> 44:55.360
Your priest makes that
more likely every day.

44:57.237 --> 44:58.822
He's not my priest.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.824
Then why give him a church?

45:04.202 --> 45:06.162
You've offended the Gods,

45:06.246 --> 45:08.164
but they spoke to me, Arthur.

45:08.248 --> 45:09.999
They gave me a sign.

45:10.083 --> 45:12.335
If we make this land
theirs once again,

45:12.419 --> 45:14.170
then they will come.

45:14.254 --> 45:16.089
They will protect us.

45:17.924 --> 45:19.342
What is this?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.387
-Wild lettuce.
-Opium lettuce.

45:24.139 --> 45:26.266
It's used to aid sleep.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.352
And it can kill,
in large enough quantities.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.940
-[pan clatters]
-You will answer me, Nimue.

45:37.026 --> 45:39.737
Did you poison those men?

45:40.822 --> 45:43.116
If they died...

45:43.199 --> 45:47.078
it was the will of the Gods.

46:04.637 --> 46:07.765
Ah, come, come.
Join us.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.852
-Not him.
-Sit... down.

46:11.728 --> 46:13.771
Lady Morgan's guard
will eat here.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.443
My Lady.

46:25.074 --> 46:27.494
Will Bishop Bedwin
be joining us?

46:27.577 --> 46:29.245
Oh, he will.

46:29.329 --> 46:31.873
Now, you must taste our wine.

46:31.956 --> 46:34.334
Made from the fruits
of our land,

46:34.417 --> 46:36.377
the water of our streams,

46:36.461 --> 46:38.922
and you will not
taste better.

46:39.005 --> 46:40.924
[both laughing]

46:43.468 --> 46:45.512
-Mm?
-Mm-hmm.

46:45.595 --> 46:47.347
d

46:47.430 --> 46:50.808
Thank you again
for receiving me.

46:50.892 --> 46:53.102
I know Arthur values

46:53.186 --> 46:55.563
the continued peace
between our lands.

46:55.647 --> 46:58.608
I find kings love peace

46:58.691 --> 47:01.319
only when war becomes
inconvenient.

47:01.402 --> 47:03.112
[laugh]

47:03.196 --> 47:05.073
But your brother's
not a king, is he?

47:06.533 --> 47:08.326
Eat! Hm!

47:13.206 --> 47:16.501
How is Lord Arthur, Derfel?

47:18.920 --> 47:21.089
He is well, my Lady.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.840
And Lady Guinevere?

47:25.677 --> 47:29.138
I know it might seem strange
for me to ask...

47:29.222 --> 47:30.848
after what happened.

47:33.226 --> 47:35.311
But I miss her very much.

47:35.395 --> 47:37.522
My mother died
when I was young.

47:38.982 --> 47:41.025
I also lost my mother.

47:42.235 --> 47:44.195
Then you can understand.

47:44.279 --> 47:46.281
Guinevere was
the one who took care of me.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.993
She was like
a sister to me.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.995
Yes.

47:52.078 --> 47:55.331
Her happiness is
as important to me as my own.

47:55.415 --> 47:57.542
Do they seem happy?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.127
They do.

48:00.712 --> 48:02.964
Then it has all worked out
as it should.

48:04.674 --> 48:06.593
Your brother must
trust you a great deal

48:06.676 --> 48:08.219
to send you in his stead.

48:08.303 --> 48:10.513
He does... trust me.

48:10.597 --> 48:13.016
-Or he's a coward.
-Forgive my nephew.

48:13.099 --> 48:16.477
Siluria is not known
for its manners!

48:18.021 --> 48:20.023
[Gorfydd]
He does make a valid point.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.942
Arthur doesn't fear
facing me, does he?

48:23.026 --> 48:25.153
No, no.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.614
He very much wishes
he could be here in person,

48:27.697 --> 48:30.992
but as I explained, he has
been detained in the west.

48:31.075 --> 48:34.370
Oh yes, yes, old Cadwys
flexing his muscles, is he?

48:34.454 --> 48:37.206
Oh, Arthur should've seen
that one coming.

48:37.290 --> 48:40.168
Uther made a fool
of Cadwys for years.

48:40.251 --> 48:43.087
So much for Arthur's
dream of unity.

48:44.255 --> 48:47.967
Oh, I... I hope
it's not just his dream.

48:48.051 --> 48:49.719
The Saxons threaten us all.

48:49.802 --> 48:53.056
It's vital that
we stay strong together.

48:53.139 --> 48:56.142
Do everything we can
to secure our futures.

48:57.060 --> 48:59.646
That was the argument
your brother made,

48:59.729 --> 49:01.939
when he offered
to marry my daughter.

49:03.733 --> 49:05.943
Yes, uh...

49:06.027 --> 49:07.570
Arthur very much regrets

49:07.654 --> 49:10.156
any hurt that
may have been caused.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.077
I'd very much
regret it as well

49:14.160 --> 49:16.287
if I'd married a whore
from Henis Wyren.

49:16.371 --> 49:17.705
-[laugh]
-Hm.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.542
But I agree,
we must do all we can

49:21.626 --> 49:23.294
to secure the future.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.630
Tell me...

49:27.507 --> 49:30.635
how do you suggest
I should do that, my Lady?

49:33.471 --> 49:37.100
By holding true
with your allies.

49:37.183 --> 49:38.685
Oh.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.520
[Morgan laughing]

49:40.603 --> 49:43.272
And what if your ally...

49:43.356 --> 49:45.733
proves to be a coward...

49:47.360 --> 49:49.112
and a liar,

49:50.363 --> 49:53.032
a whore-lover?

49:53.116 --> 49:55.076
[nervous laugh]

49:55.159 --> 49:58.121
Time for the entertainment,
don't you think?

49:58.204 --> 49:59.706
Yes...

49:59.789 --> 50:01.416
Forgive me.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.167
We have been traveling
for several days.

50:03.251 --> 50:04.752
-I should like to retire.
-Are you not enjoying

50:04.836 --> 50:07.046
-my company, Lady Morgan?
-No, no, no, I am,

50:07.130 --> 50:09.132
-but I really must insist--
-Not when we've gone

50:09.215 --> 50:10.717
to all this trouble for you!

50:10.800 --> 50:12.468
-[snaps fingers]
-Father!

50:12.552 --> 50:15.346
Take Princess Ceinwyn
to her quarters!

50:17.223 --> 50:18.474
Lady Morgan--

50:22.603 --> 50:25.606
[ominous music]

50:36.701 --> 50:39.078
Your bishop,
Lady Morgan.

50:42.582 --> 50:46.377
[Morgan crying]

50:48.254 --> 50:50.465
[Bedwin sobbing]

50:58.264 --> 51:01.350
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

51:03.603 --> 51:05.396
I did not know.

51:05.480 --> 51:09.484
This is not your doing.

51:12.779 --> 51:16.157
Stop this! Stop this!

51:16.240 --> 51:17.784
[weak cough]

51:17.867 --> 51:20.286
Arthur is a pretender
born to a whore mother,

51:20.369 --> 51:21.871
to a whore he has returned.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.332
So long as Dumnonia fights
for the whore-lover,

51:24.415 --> 51:26.167
as long as
Dumnonia is our enemy,

51:26.250 --> 51:28.628
our enemy will be
the generous provider

51:28.711 --> 51:31.214
of our gold,
of our slaves,

51:31.297 --> 51:33.382
of our land,
of our food,

51:33.466 --> 51:36.636
of our women,
and of our glory!

51:36.719 --> 51:39.096
[cheers]

51:41.474 --> 51:43.434
Ah...

51:46.646 --> 51:47.814
I'm here.

51:47.897 --> 51:50.566
My Lord calls me
to his side.

51:50.650 --> 51:53.194
No, no! Please.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.822
Please spare him.

51:55.905 --> 51:58.741
This is not his doing.
Please, I beg you.

51:58.825 --> 52:01.410
Please, I beg of you!

52:01.494 --> 52:03.454
The druidess loves
the bishop.

52:05.998 --> 52:09.335
-Derfel.
-I can't. I can't!

52:09.418 --> 52:11.295
My Lady!

52:12.880 --> 52:15.800
I'm here. I'm here.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.803
My Lady Morgan.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.638
I'm here.

52:22.723 --> 52:25.726
-You are here.
-[sobbing]

52:27.687 --> 52:29.438
I'm glad...

52:30.648 --> 52:33.359
I was able
to look upon you...

52:34.819 --> 52:38.447
-[sobbing]
-...your face, one last time.

52:38.531 --> 52:39.866
[sobbing]

52:39.949 --> 52:44.912
I have been yours... always.

52:46.539 --> 52:48.457
I'm so sorry!

52:51.460 --> 52:53.754
My Lord will bless me...

52:55.047 --> 52:56.632
and keep me.

52:56.716 --> 52:57.925
No, no...

52:58.009 --> 53:00.970
My heart knows no fear.

53:01.053 --> 53:03.723
[sobbing]

53:03.806 --> 53:06.309
-No fear.
-[halting sobs]

53:06.392 --> 53:10.313
No, no--
Derfel, no! Derfel!

53:10.396 --> 53:11.522
[Derfel screaming]

53:12.565 --> 53:14.609
[screams]

53:16.569 --> 53:18.195
No!

53:18.279 --> 53:19.906
[sobbing]

53:21.657 --> 53:23.868
[gasps]

53:38.424 --> 53:41.218
[wailing]

53:47.433 --> 53:49.852
[Derfel straining]

53:49.936 --> 53:51.938
Take this message...

53:52.021 --> 53:55.733
back to your Lord Arthur.

53:57.026 --> 53:58.361
[groaning]

54:06.535 --> 54:09.580
[elegiac music]
