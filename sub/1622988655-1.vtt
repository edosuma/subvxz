- It's funny!

17:43.845 --> 17:45.187
It's not.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.421
- Shall we?

I fell asleep,

19:02.116 --> 19:03.907

unless I get there.

Hey, mate.

23:03.972 --> 23:05.380
Cool.

23:05.413 --> 23:06.277
New mate?

23:06.309 --> 23:08.324
Yeah, this... mm.

23:23.493 --> 23:25.252
Lara, you're here!

23:26.437 --> 23:28.261
- Is that Lara?
- Yeah.

23:28.293 --> 23:32.324
You look... fascinating.

23:32.356 --> 23:34.309
I'm so sorry to hear
about Granny.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.396
I know you were close.

23:35.429 --> 23:38.372
Quick, quick, let's see
who can touch Lara first?

23:38.405 --> 23:40.292
Hands where we can see 'em,
Andrew, you creepy old git.

23:40.325 --> 23:41.572
Hello, Uncle Andrew.

23:41.604 --> 23:43.205
Not a famous artist yet then?

23:43.236 --> 23:44.261
Not yet.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.604
Still working on it.

23:45.637 --> 23:47.012
You were always jolly creative

23:47.045 --> 23:48.676
with your sandcastles
as a child.

23:48.709 --> 23:51.141
Perhaps you could move
into architecture.

23:51.172 --> 23:53.284
I'll consider it.

23:53.317 --> 23:55.044
Horrid news about Granny.

23:55.077 --> 23:57.316
She always made
a spiffing trifle.

23:57.349 --> 23:59.173
Our George is doing
rather good in the city.

23:59.204 --> 24:01.828
He's here with
his new fiancée, Bea.

24:01.861 --> 24:03.940
She's heir to
a biscuit fortune, you know.

24:03.973 --> 24:06.724
And she has
a marvelous backside!

24:06.757 --> 24:09.221
Oh, here they are.

24:09.252 --> 24:10.789
Hey, cuz.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.484
Jolly shite news
about Granny, eh?

24:12.517 --> 24:14.533
Still, 103?

24:14.564 --> 24:16.005
Bugger me.

24:16.037 --> 24:19.685
Anyway, this is
my better half, Beatrice.

24:19.716 --> 24:21.765
Oh, you can call me Beastie!

24:21.797 --> 24:23.973
That's what the girls call me
at the rowing club,

24:24.004 --> 24:26.757
seeing as
we're going to be family!

24:26.788 --> 24:28.325
Hi, Beastie.

24:28.356 --> 24:31.365
Congratulations,
George is a catch.

24:31.397 --> 24:33.092
You're telling me!

24:33.125 --> 24:35.045
It took a while
to wear him down,

24:35.076 --> 24:36.453
but I got there,
didn't I, bunny?

24:36.484 --> 24:37.892
You did, puppet!

24:37.925 --> 24:39.012
I did!

24:39.045 --> 24:42.084
So Daddy is thinking of using
our estate in Berkshire

24:42.117 --> 24:45.732
for the reception,
and I was going to ask

24:45.765 --> 24:48.677
if you would be a bridesmaid!

24:48.708 --> 24:51.076
You're screaming for a makeover!

24:51.109 --> 24:53.412
Ooh, I can't wait!

24:53.445 --> 24:54.693
Neither can I.

24:54.724 --> 24:56.740
Excuse us, humans,

24:56.773 --> 24:59.493
we need to go and help Dad
arrange his brain.

25:03.876 --> 25:04.996
Stick out if you can.

25:05.028 --> 25:06.052
Are you okay?
Have you washed?

25:06.084 --> 25:07.141
I can't think about it.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.868
If I think about it,
then I'm gonna be sick again,

25:08.901 --> 25:11.108
and there is no way
that I can do...

25:11.140 --> 25:12.837
I can't do this, one of you two
are gonna have to do it.

25:12.868 --> 25:14.532
Fuck, okay, but you owe me.

25:14.565 --> 25:15.781
All right, give it here.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.796
Mother of a pig... pig?

25:21.829 --> 25:24.005
Mother of... what?

25:24.036 --> 25:25.188
I can't read
your fucking writing.

25:25.221 --> 25:26.308
I can't even fucking read this.

25:26.341 --> 25:27.268
What the fuck have you written?

25:27.301 --> 25:29.253
Well, give me a break,
it's like mystical,

25:29.284 --> 25:30.148
Scripture-like vibes.

25:30.181 --> 25:32.645
And I stained the paper
with tea as well.

25:32.676 --> 25:34.692
Looks like
you're on your own, kid.

25:34.725 --> 25:36.485
You're gonna be fine.

25:36.516 --> 25:38.757
- Oh, fuck.
- You can do it.

25:44.581 --> 25:46.628
Hello, sweetie.

25:51.076 --> 25:52.293
Hey, Mama.

25:52.324 --> 25:54.181
My girl!

25:54.212 --> 25:56.389
My darling girl!

25:56.420 --> 25:58.021
How are you?

25:58.052 --> 25:59.492
Did you get here okay?

25:59.525 --> 26:01.508
I mean, you're here,
so I suppose you did.

26:01.541 --> 26:03.332
Everything's organized,
don't worry.

26:03.365 --> 26:04.452
Oh, you've got the poem?

26:04.485 --> 26:05.828
- Yeah, I...
- Good.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.652
Well, I'm okay.

26:07.684 --> 26:11.141
Dodgy knee's playing up a bit,
but I soldier on.

26:11.172 --> 26:13.508
Fifi has been amazing!

26:13.540 --> 26:15.908
She arranged all the flowers.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.476
Everyone's been
congratulating me

26:17.509 --> 26:20.932
on looking after me own mom
in her last years.

26:20.964 --> 26:23.525
Single-handedly,
but I'm no hero.

26:23.556 --> 26:25.156
No, I won't have it.

26:25.189 --> 26:25.924
I'm not.

26:25.957 --> 26:27.908
After 30 years
in show business,

26:27.940 --> 26:29.541
I'm ready for anything!

26:29.572 --> 26:31.717
Right, here we go!

26:31.748 --> 26:33.541
Showtime.

26:33.572 --> 26:35.205
Single-handedly?

26:35.236 --> 26:36.644
Save it.

26:36.676 --> 26:38.341
At least I've avoided Fifi.

26:38.372 --> 26:39.908
Don't speak so soon.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.941
- Darling!
- Oh, here we go.

26:43.972 --> 26:47.236
Fifi, I thought you said
I had to wear black.

26:47.269 --> 26:48.901
No. Did I say that?

26:48.932 --> 26:51.908
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh, well, never mind.

26:51.940 --> 26:52.996
You know what I'm like.

26:53.029 --> 26:56.388
Couldn't resist a little bit
of color for Granny.

26:56.421 --> 26:59.140
Oh, Granny.

26:59.172 --> 27:01.508
It's not right.

27:01.540 --> 27:03.237
These were hers.

27:03.268 --> 27:05.028
And I love them, Granny.

27:05.061 --> 27:07.876
They look fabulous on me.

27:07.908 --> 27:09.124
But you, darling,

27:09.157 --> 27:11.525
oh, look at you!

27:11.556 --> 27:16.452
You look... how much
do you weigh now?

27:16.485 --> 27:17.893
Adrian!

27:17.924 --> 27:19.780
Darling!

27:21.829 --> 27:23.172
What was that?

27:23.205 --> 27:25.540
That was Fifi, Dad's pet twat.

27:25.573 --> 27:28.228
She's happy.

27:28.261 --> 27:29.860
Well, the house is hers now.

27:29.892 --> 27:31.172
No.

27:31.204 --> 27:32.293
Do you think?

27:32.324 --> 27:34.660
How much do I weigh?

27:34.692 --> 27:37.060
Well, maybe she could eat you.

27:37.093 --> 27:38.917
That's one way
of getting rid of you.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.741
God help me.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.188
Fucking troll,
that's the thing.

27:45.220 --> 27:47.492
I'm just like...
do you know who I love?

27:47.524 --> 27:48.965
I love Bella.

27:48.996 --> 27:50.629
She's always... the thing is

27:50.661 --> 27:52.900
even though I'm clearly
like the party one,

27:52.932 --> 27:55.812
she's like... yeah,
but she's also the party one.

27:55.845 --> 27:57.765
I feel like she always has
the most fun.

27:57.796 --> 28:00.037
Like she's always like,
"Oh, touch me, touch me!"

28:00.068 --> 28:01.764
Ohh!

28:01.796 --> 28:04.037
Listen... oh, my God,
look who it is.

28:04.069 --> 28:05.701
- You've gotta do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

28:05.732 --> 28:07.396
- Are you gonna do it?
- Fuck it!

28:07.428 --> 28:09.156
- All right.
- Do it here.

28:10.693 --> 28:12.165
- Hi, you all right?
- Yeah.

28:12.196 --> 28:13.125
I don't know
if you remember me,

28:13.156 --> 28:14.852
but I'm actually
one of your biggest fans.

28:14.884 --> 28:16.005
But I'm also an artist,

28:16.036 --> 28:18.084
and I was thinking that maybe
we could, like, sit down,

28:18.116 --> 28:19.237
have a chat,
because I wanted to, like,

28:19.268 --> 28:20.740
design some of your next flyers

28:20.772 --> 28:22.564
or even like the artwork
for your next single.

28:22.596 --> 28:23.716
I don't know where
the rest of the band are,

28:23.748 --> 28:24.964
but maybe we could just,
like, hang out,

28:24.997 --> 28:25.796
have a drink or something cool,

28:25.828 --> 28:27.877
like there's
an after party and...

28:27.908 --> 28:28.997
We can do that sometime,

28:29.029 --> 28:31.461
but I've got to actually
shoot off right now, love, so...

28:31.492 --> 28:33.444
but listen, if I were you,
I'd go home as well, love,

28:33.476 --> 28:36.132
because your nose is bleeding.

28:36.165 --> 28:37.444
Dorian, come on, babe.

28:37.477 --> 28:40.005
All right.

28:40.036 --> 28:42.372
Before you go, stick that
in your pocket, yeah?

28:42.405 --> 28:44.197
Have a good night,
I'll see you soon.

28:44.228 --> 28:46.756
- Cheers.
- Buy some jeans that fit.

28:53.029 --> 28:54.532
Oh, my God,
you won't believe this,

28:54.564 --> 28:55.909
but he is gonna put us
on the guest list

28:55.941 --> 28:59.044
for Reading Festival.

29:00.165 --> 29:01.444
After party at Sam's!

29:01.477 --> 29:03.204
- Yes!
- Let's do it.

29:05.988 --> 29:08.036
- Ooh, babe?
- Yeah.

29:08.068 --> 29:09.220
Don't forget it's your Nan's
funeral tomorrow.

29:09.253 --> 29:10.884
Look, I'm gonna go
for an hour, an hour!

29:10.916 --> 29:12.229
- An hour.
- An hour!

29:12.261 --> 29:13.605
- An hour.
- An hour?

29:13.636 --> 29:14.756
- An hour.
- An hour.

29:15.812 --> 29:16.580
Ow!

29:19.588 --> 29:22.597
And now Jane's
youngest grandchild, Lara,

29:22.628 --> 29:24.100
will read a poem
she wrote for her

29:24.132 --> 29:26.341
when she was only 10 years old.

29:26.372 --> 29:27.844
Lara.

30:01.125 --> 30:03.364
Grandma, grandmother.

30:06.661 --> 30:07.877
A mother of two.

30:09.733 --> 30:11.205
A sister to four.

30:14.052 --> 30:15.236
An enemy to none.

30:18.181 --> 30:19.972
A listener to all.

30:23.076 --> 30:24.676
The oceans of love...

30:27.588 --> 30:29.604
...you bless us all with...

30:31.845 --> 30:33.541
...as pure as doves.

30:36.549 --> 30:38.469
And my reason to live.

30:41.477 --> 30:43.876
A magical voice...

30:45.349 --> 30:48.452
that tells tales so great.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.853
A voice that is free
of pain and hate.

30:58.661 --> 31:02.180
Her strength is stronger
than an ocean wave.

31:03.621 --> 31:07.237
And she is as strong
as she is brave.

31:10.149 --> 31:13.508
Her beauty is so rich

31:13.540 --> 31:16.901
as a river is deep.

31:16.933 --> 31:21.541
Her gentle loving touch
keeps me safe in my sleep.

31:26.276 --> 31:28.485
Once more with a little
more feeling, darling?

31:48.132 --> 31:49.284
What's that?

31:49.316 --> 31:50.501
Cake.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.549
Haven't you got any more white?

31:52.581 --> 31:54.884
Nah, it's all gone.

31:54.916 --> 31:56.261
But try this.

31:56.293 --> 31:57.956
You're gonna love it.

31:57.988 --> 32:02.628
Smoother than coke
and helps you come off Mandy.

32:02.660 --> 32:03.748
Ooh?

32:06.757 --> 32:08.292
Right.

32:13.124 --> 32:14.565
There you go.

32:14.597 --> 32:16.900
All right.

32:20.261 --> 32:21.636
Oh.

32:21.668 --> 32:23.876
Fuck, that's strong.

32:30.564 --> 32:31.492
Are you all right?

32:31.524 --> 32:33.380
Mhm.

32:33.412 --> 32:35.012
I'm gonna go find Tommy.

32:35.044 --> 32:37.060
You do that.

32:39.844 --> 32:41.956
Did you like it?

32:41.988 --> 32:43.780

you're the fucking weak link.

- What's wrong with my playing?
- I think... I think...

34:08.484 --> 34:10.147

38:58.308 --> 39:00.580
for Daniel at the pub today.

39:02.148 --> 39:03.972
Mm.

39:04.005 --> 39:06.852
Lara, you should be there.

39:08.997 --> 39:10.213
Right.

39:20.613 --> 39:23.141
Just sleep, darling.

39:25.669 --> 39:27.268
Just sleep.

40:47.525 --> 40:49.636
I thought this guy might want
to ride in the back with you.

40:49.668 --> 40:51.396
Oh, Chris.

40:59.268 --> 41:00.580
Bloody hell.

41:00.613 --> 41:03.204
I haven't used this
since Glasto.

41:03.237 --> 41:05.925
It smells of BO and shame.

41:05.956 --> 41:07.845
- Sorry, mate.
- Thanks, babe.

41:07.876 --> 41:10.917
Honestly, anything is better
than being there right now.

41:10.948 --> 41:11.781
Well, look, you can...

41:11.812 --> 41:13.861
you can stay here
as long as you want.

41:13.893 --> 41:17.828

41:17.860 --> 41:18.884
What is it?

41:18.916 --> 41:20.196
- What does it say?
- Nailed it, babe.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.188
Oh.

41:21.221 --> 41:22.404
You can stay
as long as you want,

41:22.437 --> 41:24.196
make yourself at home.

41:24.228 --> 41:27.333
All are loved and welcomed
at Lady Lara's Towers.

41:27.364 --> 41:29.476
If only my actual mother
felt the same way.

41:31.812 --> 41:32.645
Well, I would talk to her, babe,

41:32.676 --> 41:35.877
but she hates me
and she wants me dead,

41:35.908 --> 41:37.764
so, probably wouldn't help.

41:37.797 --> 41:38.853
She doesn't hate you, babe,

41:38.884 --> 41:42.628
she just lives
on another planet.

41:42.661 --> 41:43.684
She finds it easier
to blame you

41:43.717 --> 41:47.364
for the things she doesn't
understand about me.

41:47.397 --> 41:50.404
Well, what happened?
What was it this time?

41:50.437 --> 41:53.413
She found something
in my room and kicked off.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.300
Fuck. What?

41:55.333 --> 41:58.052
It doesn't matter.

41:58.084 --> 42:00.581
Anyway...

42:00.612 --> 42:04.612
She was going through my stuff
and I freaked out.

42:04.644 --> 42:07.268
And she said the usual

42:07.301 --> 42:08.484
"when you're under my roof"
crap,

42:08.517 --> 42:12.261
and I just snapped.

42:13.252 --> 42:14.404
Kind of told her to fuck off,

42:14.437 --> 42:17.925
which made things worse,
obviously.

42:17.956 --> 42:18.916
Then, before I knew it,

42:18.948 --> 42:23.877
we were just screaming
in each other's faces.

42:23.908 --> 42:25.636
Saying all sorts.

42:28.964 --> 42:31.557
Then she kicked me out. Again.

42:33.252 --> 42:35.524
Motherly love, eh?

42:35.557 --> 42:38.052
You know, she'd rather see
her own son on the street

42:38.085 --> 42:39.812
than to...

42:41.796 --> 42:43.268
...than to actually accept me.

42:43.300 --> 42:48.452
She loves... she bloody loves you,
Daniel, yeah?

42:48.485 --> 42:51.013
But you said it yourself, like,
she's from another planet.

42:51.044 --> 42:53.989
She's from another universe.

42:54.021 --> 42:56.292
And it will blow over,
it always does.

42:56.325 --> 42:59.301
You'll be hidin' treats
under your bed in no time.

42:59.332 --> 43:01.092
I don't know, babe.

43:01.125 --> 43:02.852
This time I...

43:04.516 --> 43:05.956
I've never...

43:08.772 --> 43:11.588
The things I said.

43:11.620 --> 43:12.548
The things she said.

43:12.580 --> 43:14.116
The way she...

43:16.516 --> 43:17.893
The way she looked at me.

43:21.733 --> 43:24.068
I'm worried this time, Lara.

43:25.156 --> 43:26.437
Feels different, you know?

43:26.468 --> 43:31.876
Look, families
are shite bags, Dan.

43:31.908 --> 43:33.924
I know that.

43:33.956 --> 43:39.013
But it will be all right,
it always is in the end.

43:39.044 --> 43:43.909
Just exhausted, babe,
of hoping and hiding.

43:43.941 --> 43:46.468
I'm... I'm fucking tired of it.

43:46.501 --> 43:48.196
I could honestly sleep
for a month.

43:48.228 --> 43:50.596
This family shit is...

43:51.589 --> 43:53.925
Look, we are family.

43:53.956 --> 43:55.652
I am family.

43:55.685 --> 43:57.956
And with me,
you don't have to hide,

43:57.988 --> 43:59.685
you don't have to change,

43:59.716 --> 44:02.788
you just have to be you,
all right?

44:02.821 --> 44:04.964
And you are not alone.

44:04.997 --> 44:05.989
You hear me?

44:08.388 --> 44:09.637
I didn't realize
I've booked a session

44:09.668 --> 44:12.324
with Jeremy Kyle's
ginger sister.

44:13.988 --> 44:15.268
I would have dressed nicer.

44:17.541 --> 44:20.132
Anyway...

44:20.164 --> 44:21.061
What about Chris?

44:21.092 --> 44:25.157
Chris, Chris is totally part
of our family.

44:25.189 --> 44:28.900
He is like a drunk uncle.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.596
- Druncle.
- Nice.

44:30.628 --> 44:32.356
Like, he gets too pissed
at weddings,

44:32.388 --> 44:35.236
he feels up the bridesmaids,
you can't take him anywhere.

44:35.268 --> 44:38.052
- Classic Chris.
- Classic Chris.

Really good friend,

Fuckin' hell.

48:37.541 --> 48:40.261
Came to so many of our gigs.

48:40.293 --> 48:42.820
He... he once told me
that our song

48:42.852 --> 48:45.157
was one of the best songs
he ever heard.

48:46.213 --> 48:48.005
Fuck this.

48:51.556 --> 48:54.372
He said he could hear
our music in his dreams.

48:55.653 --> 49:00.067

we can see you in our dreams.

49:01.987 --> 49:02.980

49:04.004 --> 49:05.156
Yeah.
