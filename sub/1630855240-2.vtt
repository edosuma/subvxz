00:12.882 --> 00:15.058
[suspenseful music]

00:16.929 --> 00:18.496
- [Edward] You don't think
I know what you're doing?

00:19.932 --> 00:20.890
Making me look like
a fool in front

00:20.933 --> 00:21.891
of all of those people.

00:21.934 --> 00:22.718
- That's not true.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.981
Oh, no [cries].

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
- And here we are again,

00:31.118 --> 00:32.206
you're not following the rules.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.557
- You don't need
to do this Edward,

00:35.600 --> 00:37.602
you really don't.

00:37.646 --> 00:38.647
- [Edward] Get up.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.170
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:40.214 --> 00:43.086
I'm so sorry [cries].

00:48.135 --> 00:49.049
- Hey, shh.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.182
If you don't stop yellin',

00:52.226 --> 00:54.619
you're gonna wake up the kids.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.231
You know what happens then.

00:57.274 --> 01:00.103
[Mrs. Tresden cries]

01:03.628 --> 01:04.890
No, please, no.

01:05.891 --> 01:06.805
- Too late.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.202
Now, let's see.

01:13.247 --> 01:16.554
Where did I leave off last time.

01:16.598 --> 01:21.603
[Mrs. Tresden screams]
[flesh sears]

02:12.262 --> 02:15.265
[Darrell knocks]

02:28.060 --> 02:29.149
- What's going on here?

02:31.847 --> 02:34.763
Valium and liquor, really Jay?

02:34.805 --> 02:36.895
- I have got to get some sleep.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.810
- Said Michael
Jackson to the doctor.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.348
[Jay sighs]

02:56.915 --> 02:59.135
It ain't easy being
a Johnson, is it.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.311
[Jay flaps lips]

03:01.355 --> 03:02.921
- Easy is overrated.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.273
A million easy women
that you could be with,

03:06.316 --> 03:09.798
but here you are with me.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.150
- At least you not as
bad as your father.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.020
- Hello.

03:16.892 --> 03:17.936
- Does it make you
mad that you got it

03:17.980 --> 03:19.460
and your brother didn't?

03:19.503 --> 03:21.462
- Emotional challenges
and intellect

03:21.505 --> 03:23.812
often live in the same house.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.335
I wouldn't trade places

03:25.379 --> 03:27.772
with that idiot for all
the peace in paradise.

03:27.816 --> 03:30.166
- Well, you may not
need peace, but I do.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.300
That job you got.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.910
You know the one
that pays you less

03:34.953 --> 03:37.216
than the one you had so
we can be together more.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.043
- Shit.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.263
[Jay laughs]

03:40.307 --> 03:44.398
- But when you here,
you not really here.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.268
And I ain't gonna lie.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.445
It's getting old.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.230
[Jay laughs]

03:50.273 --> 03:53.885
- How do you do that, hmm?
- Do what?

03:53.929 --> 03:57.019
- It's always about
you, isn't it, huh, huh.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.459
- That's right.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.766
I'm up at 2 o'clock
in the morning trying

04:04.809 --> 04:07.812
to make sure you got
your shit together.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.118
But it's about me, right.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.426
I didn't think so.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.255
I'm going to bed.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.231
- Like just keep looking.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.234
- I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.366
- Numbers, T, we're
looking for numbers,

04:39.409 --> 04:41.106
like a combination or some sort.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.718
- Do you even know
what you're doing?

04:43.761 --> 04:46.111
- Yes, I do this all the time.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.723
- Do what all the time?

04:48.766 --> 04:52.509
- Uh, it's not what you think.

04:52.553 --> 04:55.164
- It's always what I think.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.339
That bitch has gotta go.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.862
- Okay, first of all,

04:57.906 --> 04:59.386
this was his idea.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.301
And who the hell you
callin' bitch, bitch?

05:01.344 --> 05:02.824
- I'm calling you and you
need to get out of my house.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
- Hey, don't call
my mama a bitch.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.870
- Don't call my mama,
don't talk to Mama.

05:05.914 --> 05:06.436
- Okay, well, come
say it to my face, ho.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.090
- What, Mom.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.265
- It is not a problem.
- Mom, Mom.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.397
- You are in my house and-

05:10.440 --> 05:11.267
- Okay, kick me out then.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.399
Put me out.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.922
[talking over each other]

05:13.965 --> 05:14.923
- I got it just calm
down, why don't you put

05:14.966 --> 05:15.924
your arm down there.

05:15.967 --> 05:16.577
- So, put me out lady.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.578
- What?

05:17.621 --> 05:18.579
- I'm putting you out.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.144
- Oh, no, no, no.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.890
[Martin knocks]

05:25.934 --> 05:26.891
- Looks like you're
deep into something,

05:26.935 --> 05:28.153
is this a bad time?

05:33.028 --> 05:34.508
- Jean, I just sent you

05:34.551 --> 05:36.988
that Mason Manor
development thing.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.294
- [Jean] Got it, thanks.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.776
- Mason Manor,
messy housing case.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.604
Wasn't that with Ruth?

05:43.647 --> 05:46.389
- Yeah, well, she got stuck
'cause it's complicated

05:46.433 --> 05:48.130
and I like complicated.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.784
- You trying to get
on her good side?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.133
- She's got one.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.613
- Oh, it's there.
- Oh.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.397
- Yeah, she just, she
was our sole queen

05:54.441 --> 05:55.920
for a long time and
you just show up and-

05:55.964 --> 05:57.574
- Oh, it's not just that.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.316
She's also, I don't know,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.927
there are these veiled
references to Anderson.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.235
- You didn't get
that woman killed.

06:06.278 --> 06:09.499
You know, it happens to
us all sooner or later.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.416
You miss something
because you don't have

06:13.460 --> 06:14.983
a crystal ball
and everyone likes

06:15.026 --> 06:16.332
to think that you
do, but you don't.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.552
- Have you seen the latest?

06:27.561 --> 06:30.128
- And it isn't just the
men abandoning the women

06:30.172 --> 06:32.043
to the men's bad behavior.

06:32.087 --> 06:35.525
Let me introduce you
to Judge Jay Johnson.

06:35.569 --> 06:36.526
- Yeah, I can't.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.921
You can't let some kid

06:39.964 --> 06:41.096
who has no idea what
she's talking about

06:41.139 --> 06:43.098
let you second guess yourself.

06:43.141 --> 06:43.968
A while back,

06:45.448 --> 06:49.452
I was on the bench
three or four years

06:49.496 --> 06:51.236
and I was cocky.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.413
Howard even said something
to me about it once.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.936
- What did he say?

06:54.979 --> 06:56.284
- Don't get your
wings burned, Ike.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.113
- Ah.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.114
- I'm not gonna lie, I didn't
understand the reference.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.594
I had to look it up.

07:00.637 --> 07:01.899
- Icarus didn't
listen to his daddy

07:01.943 --> 07:04.119
and flew too close to the sun.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.034
- [Together] And got
his wings burned.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.126
- Anyway, I had Loretha Mathis

07:11.169 --> 07:12.519
on our domestic violence docket.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.607
She hit her mother over the head

07:13.650 --> 07:15.173
with a skillet.

07:15.217 --> 07:18.002
And she came in here angry,

07:18.046 --> 07:19.526
yelling and cursing
with all that.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.443
Problem was I got caught
up in her attitude

07:24.400 --> 07:25.401
and I didn't listen.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.449
I always sent DV
cases to probation

07:30.972 --> 07:32.495
for them to write up a
pre-sentencing report,

07:32.539 --> 07:33.540
but she got so far
underneath my skin

07:35.542 --> 07:38.153
and once she pled out, I
sentenced her right there.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.550
I put her in jail
for six months.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.465
- So what happened?

07:46.683 --> 07:49.207
- Less than two months
after she got out,

07:49.251 --> 07:51.122
she was dead, poisoning.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.037
- Her mother?

07:54.256 --> 07:55.082
- Ethyl alcohol.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.303
Takes a while and
it's not pretty

07:59.783 --> 08:02.438
and had I got a
pre-sentencing report,

08:02.482 --> 08:03.961
I would've known that
Loretha's mother had

08:04.005 --> 08:07.138
a long history with CPS
for abusing her kids.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.662
- Hmm.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.228
- Loretha was the oldest

08:10.272 --> 08:11.403
and she was just
trying to protect

08:11.447 --> 08:12.100
her brothers and sisters,

08:13.580 --> 08:17.627
but all I saw was
a loud, Black woman

08:20.282 --> 08:22.545
and I have to live with that.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.506
The point is, we're judges.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.639
And we're not infallible.

08:31.119 --> 08:31.641
- Thank you.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.002
- Uh, Judge, I'm gonna
get to the Mason thing,

08:45.046 --> 08:47.048
but your docket is pretty thick,

08:47.091 --> 08:48.440
so we gotta get out there now.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.267
- Hmm.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.052
- As do I, yeah.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.227
You okay?

08:52.270 --> 08:54.359
- Better, although, yeah,

08:54.403 --> 08:56.274
you could've come
in with that story

08:56.318 --> 08:57.667
a little bit sooner.

08:57.711 --> 08:58.668
- Yeah.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.322
- Martin.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.192
- Howard.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.633
- Did he tell you about Loretha?

09:06.676 --> 09:07.634
- How'd you know?

09:07.677 --> 09:09.070
- I told him to.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.724
After that ignorant shit he did.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.595
The least he could do is make

09:12.639 --> 09:13.596
it come to some good.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.644
Want one?

09:17.687 --> 09:19.733
- No, I'm good, thank you.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.605
- So how's our docket
shaping up for today?

09:22.649 --> 09:25.652
- Just got a DV from
Deep Alpharetta.

09:25.695 --> 09:26.653
That's unusual.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.306
- Deep Alpharetta?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.831
- Oh, you know, Deep Alpharetta.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.615
They're where the houses get big

09:32.659 --> 09:34.138
and really far apart.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.750
You see, I'm from
Shallow Alpharetta.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.317
And you have been in
swats for a long time,

09:39.361 --> 09:41.319
which is starting
to get rough around

09:41.363 --> 09:42.799
the edges, no.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.236
- Well, that's true
everywhere, sis.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.629
- Why do you stay?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.239
- I'm too old to change.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.806
Besides, you and Martin can have

09:49.850 --> 09:52.069
a Shallow Alpharetta.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.593
- Got no flavor.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.334
- Flavor?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.162
- All those people out
there with their MAGA hats

09:58.206 --> 09:59.599
in Southwest Atlanta,

09:59.642 --> 10:01.078
talking about
defunding the police.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.733
Two communities, full of people,

10:03.777 --> 10:05.343
looking for somebody
else to blame

10:05.387 --> 10:07.607
for their predicament
other than themselves.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.609
You know, muni court
used to be a place

10:09.652 --> 10:11.654
where regular people
who got themselves

10:11.698 --> 10:13.395
in a squeeze came.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.834
Now, the whole world's worries

10:17.878 --> 10:21.229
and America's failings
wash up in waves.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.145
But I'm retiring in two.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.150
- Look, I think we
should get out of here.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.674
Domestic violence dockets
are always a beast.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.415
- Let them wait.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.112
What are they
gonna do, complain?

10:35.156 --> 10:36.461
They're all out there trying not

10:36.505 --> 10:38.681
to go to jail and you the one

10:38.725 --> 10:40.770
they gotta convince
not to send them.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.119
- Yeah, but.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.730
- Yeah, but my ass.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.514
- [Jean] Judge!

10:45.557 --> 10:48.082
- You worry too much, Jean.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.693
Jean knows what's
what, don't you, sis?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.913
- Judge, I swear you
get worse every day.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.262
Andrew told me that you cursed

10:54.305 --> 10:56.438
on the bench twice last week.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.701
- Two years, count 'em, two,

10:58.745 --> 11:01.312
with nary an election in 'em.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.664
And I'm ridin' off
into the sunset

11:04.707 --> 11:08.842
with a full pension
and health benefits.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.408
- Get it together.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.454
- There's nothing
they can do to me now.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.850
I say what I like and
I like what I say.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.940
- Thanks for giving
me Jean, by the way.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.768
She keeps me-
- Altogether, I know, yeah.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.726
- You don't have to
keep thanking me.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.554
My sister's been worried
about me retiring.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.730
I go, she's out of a job.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.253
Now that you're here,

11:29.297 --> 11:30.777
she's good to go
as long as you are.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.735
- I just, I still feel
like we're cheating

11:32.779 --> 11:34.171
on you or something.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.130
- At the first opportunity,

11:36.173 --> 11:37.740
I'll ask a favor of you,

11:37.784 --> 11:39.350
then we'll be even, how's that?

11:40.177 --> 11:41.135
- It'll work.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.702
[Howard chuckles]

11:42.745 --> 11:43.833
- Okay, I better go
and get robed up.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.879
All right, take care now.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.755
- Okay, I'll accept that plea.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.975
Prosecutor Meeks,
what do we have here?

11:55.018 --> 11:57.804
- Your Honor, on the
date and time indicated,

11:57.847 --> 12:01.329
police were called to the
house of Edward Trasden

12:01.372 --> 12:04.593
by one 16-year-old
Elliot Trasden.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.901
That's the son of the
defendant and he victim.

12:07.944 --> 12:08.945
- Victim?

12:08.989 --> 12:09.772
- Yes.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.904
Victim.

12:12.906 --> 12:13.776
Let's see here.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.866
Once they arrived,
Mr. Trasden refused

12:16.910 --> 12:18.781
to let the officers in,

12:18.825 --> 12:20.914
so they forced the door.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.872
Once inside, the
son told the police

12:22.916 --> 12:25.570
his mother was in
the master bathroom.

12:25.614 --> 12:26.746
When they coaxed her out,

12:26.789 --> 12:28.269
they noticed that she had

12:28.312 --> 12:30.488
a bright red spot on the
left side of her face,

12:30.532 --> 12:32.577
indicating that she
had been slapped.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.579
- If I may, Your Honor.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.191
Mr. Trasden does admit
to hitting Mrs. Trasden,

12:37.234 --> 12:39.802
but these were
extraordinary circumstances.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.369
My client had just found out

12:41.412 --> 12:42.936
that his wife was
having an affair

12:42.979 --> 12:44.546
and in the heat of an
argument slapped her.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.896
He regrets that, Your Honor,

12:46.940 --> 12:49.029
and while we know
this court prefers

12:49.072 --> 12:50.770
to send these
matters to probation

12:50.813 --> 12:53.555
to make a pre-trial
sentencing report,

12:53.598 --> 12:54.861
we humbly request

12:54.904 --> 12:57.602
that you consider
sentencing today.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.343
Mr. Trasden is an
investment banker

12:59.387 --> 13:01.389
with no criminal record.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.783
He understands he was wrong

13:05.523 --> 13:07.003
and just so you're
comfortable, Judge,

13:07.047 --> 13:08.352
Ms. Trasden is
here and is willing

13:08.396 --> 13:10.050
to confirm these statements.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.922
- I always send DVs for
pre-sentencing reports.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.794
- Can you just hear from her?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.273
I think she'll put
your mind at ease.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.232
- Okay, well, send her in.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.799
- Thank you, Judge.

13:19.842 --> 13:20.930
- But I don't know
what she'll say

13:20.974 --> 13:21.844
that'll make me change my mind.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.947
Mrs. Trasden, you can
come up here, please.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.035
- Thank you.

13:40.907 --> 13:41.864
- How are you?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.692
- I'm fine, Your Honor.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.346
- If I may, I'd like to ask
her a few questions just

13:45.389 --> 13:46.869
to move this thing along.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.523
- Mr. Malloy, there is no way

13:48.566 --> 13:50.481
that I'm letting the attorney

13:50.525 --> 13:54.007
of a domestic
violence perpetrator
interrogate a victim.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.573
This is not a trial.

13:55.617 --> 13:56.836
- Certainly, Your Honor.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.882
- Mrs. Trasden,
you are the victim

13:59.926 --> 14:02.754
and this is not a trial.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.713
You can speak to me
now if you want to,

14:04.756 --> 14:06.758
but you do not have to.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.413
You can speak to my
probation officer privately

14:09.457 --> 14:11.981
if this is too
uncomfortable for you.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.896
Moreover, you have the right

14:13.940 --> 14:16.899
to request a restraining
order against Mr. Trasden

14:16.943 --> 14:18.945
if you feel that
you have any concern

14:18.988 --> 14:21.034
about his safety while
he's out awaiting

14:21.077 --> 14:23.601
a pre-sentencing report.

14:23.645 --> 14:27.040
And I am very serious about
my restraining orders.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.390
If you so much as
pass her on the street

14:29.433 --> 14:32.567
and wink, you will
serve every single day

14:32.610 --> 14:34.612
of six months in jail.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.831
- Oh, no, I understand.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.876
This is my fault.

14:45.623 --> 14:49.323
- Mrs. Trasden,
where is Elliott?

14:49.366 --> 14:50.585
- He's at-
- He's fine.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.717
- Your mama never told you

14:52.761 --> 14:54.023
to speak when spoken to?

14:54.067 --> 14:56.504
First of all, I
wasn't talking to you

14:56.547 --> 14:58.985
and second of all
I asked where he is

14:59.028 --> 15:01.901
and I asked that
question to Ms. Trasden.

15:03.598 --> 15:04.773
- Judge, this is just a case

15:04.816 --> 15:07.123
of a fleeting moment of anger

15:07.167 --> 15:09.821
after he received
such devastating news.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.649
If the court could
just consider closing

15:11.693 --> 15:13.390
this matter today,

15:13.434 --> 15:16.002
both Mr. and Mrs. Trasden
would be grateful.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.752
[Jay clears throat]

15:31.408 --> 15:31.974
- You know what?

15:33.540 --> 15:36.152
Okay, I agree.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.546
There's no need for a
pre-sentencing report

15:38.589 --> 15:40.026
at this time.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.201
- Thank you so much, Your Honor.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.376
You will not regret this.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.986
- Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
We're anxious to get this
marriage back on track.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.859
- Mr. Trasden,
based on your plea

15:47.903 --> 15:50.036
of no contest to both
obstruction of justice

15:50.079 --> 15:51.820
and domestic violence,

15:51.863 --> 15:53.778
I find you guilty as charged

15:53.822 --> 15:55.998
and sentenced you to
eight months in jail.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.001
I will stay all but 60
days of that sentence,

15:59.045 --> 16:00.785
but you must start
serving today.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.745
Jean, will you get Mr. Wheeler
and Mr. Grimes in here.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.747
Mr. Trasden is
going to jail today.

16:07.227 --> 16:10.795
Now, I don't know what's
going on in your house,

16:10.839 --> 16:13.102
but what I do know is
that I am not gonna let

16:13.146 --> 16:14.712
you go home.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.541
You are a man who
is prone to anger.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.021
I could see it all in your face,

16:19.065 --> 16:20.066
the way you fix your suit,

16:20.109 --> 16:22.633
the way you smile.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.071
You're a man that
needs to be in control

16:25.114 --> 16:27.116
at all times.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.119
And what's interesting is
that she walked in here

16:30.163 --> 16:32.034
and you smiled like
a Cheshire cat,

16:32.078 --> 16:33.470
even though you had just learned

16:33.514 --> 16:35.646
that you cheated on you.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.039
Mm-mm.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.129
I also asked, "Where is Elliott

16:40.173 --> 16:43.002
and you said to me, "He's fine."

16:43.045 --> 16:45.700
Well, why in the
world wouldn't he be?

16:45.743 --> 16:49.051
What I believe is that
you didn't just slap her.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.835
You beat her, didn't you?

16:51.923 --> 16:53.055
Because I know the difference

16:53.099 --> 16:54.056
between a flinch of surprise

16:54.100 --> 16:55.840
and a flinch of pain.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.233
Now what I'm going
to do is I'm going

16:57.277 --> 16:59.018
to send social
services to that house

16:59.061 --> 17:00.584
and have them report back to me.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.499
That'll determine
whether I continue

17:02.543 --> 17:04.022
to stay those last six months

17:04.066 --> 17:05.894
or whether he'll
have to serve them,

17:05.936 --> 17:09.463
but whatever happens,
Mrs. Trasden is not safe

17:09.506 --> 17:10.855
and neither is her son

17:11.856 --> 17:12.988
and I'm gonna ask you

17:13.031 --> 17:14.119
and you can answer me truthfully

17:14.163 --> 17:15.034
because you are safe here.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.645
Is Elliott okay?

17:25.131 --> 17:26.741
- No, he's not, Your Honor.

17:30.353 --> 17:31.833
- [Mother] Come here Michael.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.532
[Michael sighs]

17:37.143 --> 17:38.666
- Yes, Mom.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.189
- I need to know how
that packing is going.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.756
- [Michael] Come on,
I thought we talked

17:41.799 --> 17:43.323
about this already.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.194
- What we talked about
was you all moving in

17:45.238 --> 17:46.978
for just a few weeks

17:47.022 --> 17:49.111
after you lost all
the money influencing.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.939
- Come on, Ma,
this is the future.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.636
Look, I got some
dope bright ideas.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.030
- All you got is debt, a diploma

17:55.074 --> 17:56.640
and bad taste in women.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.555
- [Tanisha] I heard that.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.166
- This is my house.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.124
- Okay, but it was his idea.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.691
Why I gotta leave?

18:03.734 --> 18:05.214
- Ma, come on, you act
like were were stealing.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.129
We was, you know, just
down there looking for the-

18:07.173 --> 18:09.131
- Oh, please.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.220
You might be hanging
with a criminal,

18:11.264 --> 18:13.614
you're not cut out for this.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.137
- Really?

18:15.181 --> 18:15.964
You wanna talk
about me like that

18:16.007 --> 18:16.965
in front of her?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.140
I am your son, hello.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.926
- My son, 28, in my basement

18:21.970 --> 18:23.189
with the corner ho.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.191
- Uh, okay, bitch,
I know you old,

18:25.234 --> 18:26.670
but you better watch-
- No, no, no.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.107
- Relax, stop.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.893
- You saw that, right?

18:31.936 --> 18:33.068
- Yeah, I saw that.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.157
- [Father] Come on, goddamn it.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.596
- Look what you did.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.250
Now I got to deal with this.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.296
Son of a bitch.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.340
Get to packing.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.127
- I told you we
would get caught.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.258
What we supposed to do now?

18:49.302 --> 18:50.825
- Nothing, just relax, aight.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.043
Look, one he go on
his little rant,

18:52.087 --> 18:54.176
that's no longer our problem.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.960
We could just chill.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.136
- You hurt my wrist earlier.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.401
- Mm.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.619
Go make me a sandwich.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.319
- Okay.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.761
[Michael exhales]

19:13.804 --> 19:14.631
- You guys ready?

19:15.328 --> 19:17.068
You guys ready?

19:17.112 --> 19:21.160
Okay, so, are we all
set for our plea deals?

19:21.203 --> 19:24.075
Okay, are we ready
to take pleas, Judge.

19:24.902 --> 19:25.816
[Howard snores]

19:25.860 --> 19:26.730
Judge.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.345
Judge.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.270
- So, um, what happened?

19:44.313 --> 19:46.228
- The long and the
short of it, Your Honor,

19:46.272 --> 19:48.883
is that Ms. Hardeman
asked their son, Leo, Jr.,

19:48.926 --> 19:50.145
to do the dishes.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.626
He balked and Leo intervened.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.105
There was a bit of
pushing and shoving,

19:54.149 --> 19:56.717
but there is no question
that Leo was first

19:56.760 --> 19:59.415
to put his hands on his son.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.243
- Got to barking in
your house, did he?

20:01.287 --> 20:02.766
- Something like that.

20:02.810 --> 20:07.031
- Your Honor, my client
pleads no contest.

20:08.032 --> 20:08.859
- I accept that.

20:09.773 --> 20:10.905
Who called the police?

20:10.948 --> 20:12.646
- Mrs. Hardeman.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.430
But to be clear,
she was concerned

20:14.474 --> 20:17.303
for her husband, not the boy.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.349
Stand up.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.229
- Got it.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.319
Leo, is there
anything you'd like

20:33.362 --> 20:34.842
to say before I rule?

20:35.973 --> 20:37.236
- He's right.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.150
My wife told him
to do the dishes

20:39.194 --> 20:40.674
and he refused.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.458
Personally, I see
that as discipline.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.026
But, I see the law
sees it otherwise.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.767
- Yeah, they get
called on a domestic,

20:46.810 --> 20:49.944
it's automatic arrest policy.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.380
Somebody's gotta go.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.861
Mr. Hardeman, I find you guilty,

20:54.775 --> 20:56.124
but impose no jail time.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.388
I'm gonna fine you $250.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.390
And if I were you,
I'd make him pay it.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.045
I had to find him guilty

21:04.088 --> 21:06.047
because technically, he is.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.309
But let me tell you what, son.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.051
You not a victim of anything,

21:11.487 --> 21:13.315
so don't let what just

35:20.292 --> 35:21.815
Everything is about you.

Everything is about
me, this relationship.

It's not just me and you.

honest about my shit.

family that fucking loves me

35:47.754 --> 35:50.278

to fucking say this

35:50.322 --> 35:51.888
because I don't like
to use this word,

35:51.932 --> 35:53.281
but you're fucking jealous

35:53.325 --> 35:56.241
and that is the
root of your shit.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.416
Maybe you need to go out there

35:57.459 --> 35:59.244
and find your fucking father.

You took my plans.

congenial domestic violence

37:52.008 --> 37:53.749
I've ever encountered.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.187
- They called it
in as a domestic?

37:57.231 --> 37:58.319
- Yep.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.452
- No way we can nudge

38:00.495 --> 38:04.325
this down to assault
or disorderly?

38:05.413 --> 38:06.719

38:06.762 --> 38:07.328
it's out of our hands.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.156
- Aw, damn.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.332
- Hey, Judge, if you
can just identify

38:11.376 --> 38:14.292
the main perpetrator, we
can call it in as that.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.337

38:17.860 --> 38:20.080
Just one second, please.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.870

not been to jail before.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.050

dad, he's the problem.
