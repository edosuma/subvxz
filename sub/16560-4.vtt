WEBVTT

00:22.939 --> 00:24.482
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.360
-I thought you had the night off.
-No, I picked up Jenny's shift.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.820
What about your ecology final?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.905
Don't worry, I know my mollusks
from my malways.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.407
-I'll be fine.
-Bree.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.326
I know, but I'm not gonna make tuition
if I don't pick up extra shifts.

00:37.829 --> 00:38.830
You looking for these?

00:40.081 --> 00:41.124
You know me too well.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.292
Listen.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.087
You're not gonna have to worry
about money much longer.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.214
Okay. Sure, Dad.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.551
Be safe.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.518
Up at night I'm awake
'Cause it haunts me

01:00.602 --> 01:02.854
That I never got to
Say what I wanted

01:02.937 --> 01:04.397
Oh my God

01:05.732 --> 01:08.193
I would jump out my skin
Just to get you

01:08.276 --> 01:09.819
Oh my God

01:10.320 --> 01:11.905
Oh my God

01:16.659 --> 01:18.620
...Too close to the bottom

01:19.079 --> 01:21.331
I'm right back where I started

01:21.414 --> 01:23.708
Said I'm fine

01:23.875 --> 01:27.587
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya

01:27.670 --> 01:29.214
Said I'm fine

01:29.297 --> 01:34.010
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya

01:34.886 --> 01:37.430
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.308
But can we take it back a sec?
I just want to hit that chorus again.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.102
I'd love to, honey,
but your time's up.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.521
You wanna book a third hour,
it's gonna be cash up front.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.565
Um...You know what?
I nailed the chorus.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.740
Let's hope this guy evolves more
in prison than he did in the wild.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.367
That's three cases in one week.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.786
Rosila has never been so Rosilicious.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.079
You know I
wouldn't go that far.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.705
Come on, I saw you skippin'
through the precinct.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.875
-I wasn't skipping.
-There was a skip and a hop and jump.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.544
Not in that order.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.380
So it's a hat trick. What do you say,
milkshakes later at Magic City?

02:10.672 --> 02:13.424
We keep closing cases at this rate,
Mama's gonna need new pants

02:13.508 --> 02:14.467
to go with that milkshake.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.220
And I hope mama's not suggesting
drinks that Off Limits.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.222
Because even my lab's more alive
than your bar.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.724
-It's got personality.
-It's got mildew.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.309
-There's mildew all over the place.
-There's no mildew.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.229
I think we should
make Off Limits, off limits.

02:26.312 --> 02:30.775
-Okay. Yeah, it's time for a new hang.
-It's time for a new hang.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.068
Of course, yes.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.654
Guys, huddle up,
we've got a situation.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.035
Okay, Sophie's comin' here
and she's spending the day.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.579
Oh, it's Take Your Daughter
To Work Day.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.539
-Sneaks up on me every year.
-No.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.876
Sophie just started field training at
the Academy and she put in a request.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.378
To observe Captain Hornstock.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.255
Wait, you didn't tell her
about the whole demotion thing?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.423
Vi, how could I?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.258
She looks up to me, I'm her hero.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.010
So not another word
from either one of you

02:57.093 --> 02:58.803
about her old man
being back on the bottom, okay?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.347
Ira, will you have Phil
run the coffee mugs for prints?

03:01.472 --> 03:04.267
I want to get to the bottom
of who is and isn't washing.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.144
You guys are back, perfect timing.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.104
We have a dead scuba diver
down in South Beach,

03:08.188 --> 03:09.355
I want you to check it out.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.567
Sounds accidental,
why would homicide be involved?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.027
Unusual circumstances.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.447
-Dispatch is still gathering details.
-You got it.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.867
Oh, make sure
you get witness statements.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.630
This is awful, I need a moment.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.802
Stag party over.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.514
Hashtag my ass.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.724
Detective, you got a minute?

03:45.683 --> 03:47.393
Looks like things
were heating up back there.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.562
And who are you?

03:49.646 --> 03:52.232
Karl Benson, Florida Coastal Patrol.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.026
Well, thanks for bringing in
the body, but we'll take it from here.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.320
I know cops think
we're glorified lifeguards,

03:57.403 --> 04:00.406
but Coastal Patrol does a little more
than fish people out of the ocean.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.910
You wanna swap stories sometime,
I could take you out on the water.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.411
I'll get back to you on that.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.041
So, is this a diving accident?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.961
Eyes are normal. If he had come up
too fast I'd see petechiae.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.296
Capillaries ruptured due to the air
that was inside.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.048
There's plenty of air
left in that tank

04:17.131 --> 04:18.925
and lack of visible major trauma

04:19.008 --> 04:20.677
suggests that
he wasn't run over by a boat.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.428
Not sure what the marks are
on his face.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.305
Yeah, I think
I've seen this guy before.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.765
Maybe he towed his boat in.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.767
- Do you have a name for us?
- Sorry.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.936
Lot of guys like this
out in the water.

04:30.019 --> 04:33.064
No sign of his boat either.
You don't think this was an accident?

04:33.982 --> 04:36.359
Accidents don't cause hand prints.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.910
Hey, is the gas cell IR prepped?

04:46.661 --> 04:47.704
Mm-Hmm.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.497
-Are you sexting?
-No.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.250
I think I know a photo
of a naked woman when I see one, Tara.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.669
Let's not make this about me.
What are you doing?

04:55.003 --> 04:58.673
I may have, like,
met a few girls online, okay.

04:58.756 --> 04:59.924
That's exciting.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.719
But it's like, too many
'cause they won't stop texting.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.263
Yeah, I can't say that
I know what that feels like.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.015
I don't know what I'm doing.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.100
Pippy was my first everything
with a girl.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.059
Yeah.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.772
So I'm like, not ready to date.
I'm definitely not ready to sext.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.649
-I didn't even know girls did this.
-Me neither.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.984
One sent me a pic.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.988
Honestly I don't know
what body part I'm looking at.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.615
Maybe it's her flexoral hinge joint.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.534
-Oh.
-Wait.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.662
No, it's not, that's not.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.748
-Wait, what is that?
-That's not an elbow.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.583
No, I don't think it's an elbow.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.627
I wanna test the alveolar air in
our vic's bronchials when he arrives.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.004
-Got it.
-Okay.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.339
And I have some news.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.633
-There's gonna be a change here.
-What kind of change?

05:43.593 --> 05:46.763
-Hey, y'all. I'm back.
-Guess not so new.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.181
But please let's not dissect it.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.351
Listen, all talks, no talk, okay?

05:51.559 --> 05:52.393
-Yeah?
-Got it.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.478
Hi.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.355
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, mom.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.272
It's wonderful.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.442
Now, nobody get too excited,
Pip's only here temporarily.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.111
She's gonna make some money
so she can get back to recording.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.281
Recording ain't cheap and Pippy's
burning through her savings fast.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.617
Well, your return is reason for
celebration.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.203
It's been too long
since we've shared a meal.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.914
We're not just coworkers,
we're family.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.791
Dinner Sunday night, I'm cooking.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.084
Now, I like the sound of that.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.128
Good, 'cause it's gonna be
at your house, so you can't be late.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.755
Oh, snap.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.840
Oh, snap your butt downstairs
and get to work.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.133
Whatever you want boss.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.428
You know, it's good
to have you back too.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.888
Oh, son, I never left.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.432
Well, you know, the whole Gerald thing
and everything.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.601
You're sure you're okay?

06:33.893 --> 06:36.896
You took a look at his case file,
you visited him in prison,

06:36.979 --> 06:40.316
if you still think that he really
murdered those girls

06:40.400 --> 06:43.444
then what more is there to say?

07:02.463 --> 07:05.341
Sample of venous, arterial
and ventricular blood

07:05.425 --> 07:08.094
all negative for common medications
and their metabolites.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.264
Oxyhemoglobin levels were normal,
only odd thing was pleural fluid.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.558
I mean, there's no way in hell
that this was a dive gone wrong.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.603
What?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.147
Am I rusty?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.691
Not at all, glad to have you back.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.571
Cuts along the esophagus. I need
a good look at the stomach.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.614
These abrasions on his neck,
they're fresh.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.741
It's like he got in a fight
right before he was killed.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.162
And based on decomp, I say
that he died in the last 36 hours.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.539
I'll run the pleural fluid
through the RAPIDPoint 500.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.834
Bruising around his neck and water
in his lungs, that's weird.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.836
-So was he drowned or strangled?
-Both.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.172
But without markers, it's gonna be
pretty tough to figure out

07:44.255 --> 07:46.466
who this guy was,
let alone why he was killed.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.885
My guess is it has something to do...

07:52.346 --> 07:53.306
with this.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.071
He swallowed it?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.907
Yeah, I think our victim
needed to hide it fast

08:10.990 --> 08:12.992
and he didn't have
any place other than himself.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.202
There's only two ways in

08:14.202 --> 08:16.579
and I think we could all agree
he chose the right one.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.248
Well, I've seen a situation
where a guy has to go the other way.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.333
Got an ID.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.044
Vic's daughter filed
a Missing Person's Report 12 hours ago

08:23.127 --> 08:25.796
for David Benjamin Jones, 45.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.465
They share an address in Hialeah.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.842
To understand this murder,
we need to know more about this gem.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.429
Which is why I have a forensic
gemologist setting up next door.

08:38.309 --> 08:42.396
Professor Pen was there, boated
down from West Palm this morning.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.398
He insisted
we put him up at the Crescent.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.735
Five star joint
from the EMPD's dime zone.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.111
The guy better deliver.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.863
Looks like he's moving in here.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.657
Well, his refractometer is top notch.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.700
You got a pet rock collection
or something?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.244
Four ex-wives, four diamonds...

08:56.786 --> 08:59.664
Let's just say I know
a thing or two about pickin' out gems.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.666
Why don't you guys go
see what the daughter knows.

09:01.749 --> 09:05.002
We'll make sure that he does more than
rearrange furniture.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.806
He's dead, isn't he?

09:19.517 --> 09:23.104
First it was just a snorkel,
and then it was a tank.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.650
Before long, the sea
became my dad's whole life.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.528
He called me his true north.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.322
He always told me that
I was the one guiding him,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.283
but I think he was lost.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.786
-He was always searching.
-What was he searching for?

09:38.869 --> 09:40.329
The Mujer De La Fortuna.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.457
-The woman of fortune?
-Not a woman, a ship.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.961
He said there was treasure on board.
The Queen Katerina emeralds.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.381
He told me that he was gonna
find them for me,

09:50.464 --> 09:52.174
but I think he was just
trying to cheer me up.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.636
-These are interesting, what are they?
-His diving maps.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.473
-They don't look like Florida.
-My father was a very paranoid man.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.434
He wrote all of his maps in code.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.020
Not even I know
where he was searching.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.521
Did he ever find any treasure?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.565
Would we be living here if he did?

10:09.358 --> 10:10.735
How long have these been coming in?

10:11.861 --> 10:12.987
Few months.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.822
My father dove
where his instincts told him.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.324
When you don't care
about salvage rights,

10:16.407 --> 10:17.867
you're bound to step on a few toes.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.245
That's Lucy. My dad loved her.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.080
Moorish Idols can be very demanding.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.750
Highly sensitive to temperature, PH...
Has she--

10:25.916 --> 10:27.209
Is this really happening?

10:27.293 --> 10:31.130
Between school and my work, I don't
know what I'm gonna do with her.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.759
Oh, this is so happening right now.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.306
I've analyzed the marks
on Dave's face.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.392
Definitely some allergic response
to something. Not sure from what yet.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.603
I'm still trying to match diatoms
to coastal maps

10:45.686 --> 10:47.855
to see if I can narrow down
where in the ocean this guy drowned.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.399
We better or no one's gonna
offer Sunday dinner.

10:50.524 --> 10:54.320
You guys really think we're gonna
finally meet my mom's "friend" Gerald?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.157
I don't think he gets out much.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.451
Well, I heard
that it didn't work out anyway.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.912
-Daytona's very far away.
-It's far.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.247
What happened?

11:05.956 --> 11:08.459
Gerald's too guarded.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.629
Huh?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.927
-What are you doing?
-Well, Moorish Idols prefer temps

11:18.010 --> 11:22.807
78 to 84 F, PH 8.2 to 8.6, don't you?

11:23.432 --> 11:24.725
Okay, look.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.145
I know that Rosie asked us
to watch over the fish, keep him alive

11:28.229 --> 11:31.232
but he's also counting on us
to solve this murder case, so...

11:31.315 --> 11:33.693
Yeah, but Lucy's going through
a lot right now, okay?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.278
And she needs our support
or she's gonna die.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.280
What?

11:38.572 --> 11:41.909
She's all alone, she's just lost
the most important person in her life,

11:41.992 --> 11:45.663
and she's trying to move on, you know,
but it's all very confusing.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.044
Look at you.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.259
I assume before we write you a check

11:58.342 --> 12:00.344
you're gonna give us some
information about this thing?

12:00.761 --> 12:03.264
See that green? Haunting, isn't it?

12:04.473 --> 12:08.269
Jagged three phase inclusion,
refractive index of 157.

12:12.940 --> 12:13.774
I'm sorry?

12:13.858 --> 12:16.026
I thought we were taking turns
not speaking English.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.738
Apologies, Captain.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.531
But holding a gem like this
in your hand,

12:20.614 --> 12:22.658
is like reaching back through time.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.828
Villa spoke with the daughter,
said her father was

12:25.911 --> 12:27.455
looking for the Katerina emeralds.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.124
Really? That's quite ambitious.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.796
In 1733, a Spanish ship
was on its way back from Colombia.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.965
The story is that
the Captain hid a chest

12:38.048 --> 12:41.385
full of the most perfect emeralds
in the world on board,

12:41.927 --> 12:45.931
hoping to win the queen's hand,
but the ship went down in a hurricane.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.642
Eight years ago, they found it

12:48.726 --> 12:52.313
20 miles off Key Biscayne.
No emeralds on board.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.982
And they weren't even listed
on any manifest.

12:55.065 --> 12:59.737
Most experts believe
this entire story is just a myth.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.655
So our vic was searching for shadows.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.658
Well, this one is a Muzo emerald,

13:05.034 --> 13:07.119
from the Western Boyaca,
province of Colombia.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.207
-Any idea where he found that one?
-I need to run a few more tests.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.458
Of course, you do.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.588
Hey, can I borrow this book? Thanks.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.010
Dad? Oh, my God, this is so great.
Let me throw my bag in your office.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.222
-No, I need your help.
-Really? Like, on an investigation?

13:26.305 --> 13:28.474
Yep, but first
we'll find you a place to read.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.101
Okay.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.520
See this?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.194
Come on, everybody loves
a treasure hunt.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.821
-Pirates, the booty.
-Don't say booty.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.113
What you got against booty?
Seriously, what you got--

13:43.197 --> 13:46.408
I guess I don't understand searching
your whole life for something

13:46.492 --> 13:49.328
you'll probably never find and why is
no one in this company wearing shoes?

13:49.411 --> 13:52.456
I dig the vibe, it's open, it's free,
it's gonna be like our new haven.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.416
-Nautical. Nautical.
-And unsanitary.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.880
Hi. Detective, I'm Cody, president
of Silicon Shores, I got your message.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.715
You ever seen this diver before?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.176
-No.
-That's funny.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.887
Your company's been sending him
some very strongly worded letters.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.806
Well, you can talk to my lawyers
if you want.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.183
They send C&Ds to anyone
of anyone diving on one of our wrecks.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.769
So he was muscling in
on your territory, huh?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.813
You think some diver
was a threat to us?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.107
Well, let me show you something.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.484
Now, I don't like
possibilities, Detective.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.487
I like certainties,
things I can hold in my hand.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.239
Like this one.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.409
Pulled from a 1789 shipwreck
off the coast of Cuba.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.493
Nice.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.453
-You see, in the 17th century alone,
-Stop it.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.040
hundreds of ships sank after pillaging
treasures from the New World.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.668
Divers like your friend
go off a hunch.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.671
An old map, a ship's log,
eyewitness accounts,

14:40.754 --> 14:43.966
but we use Bayesian Theory
to use all historical data

14:44.049 --> 14:46.552
and pinpoint
high probability recovery areas.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.178
Then you dive down and take it?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.723
Not me, Nemo.

14:50.806 --> 14:53.058
He's the most high tech
treasure hunter ever designed.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.479
Wireless site scans, sonar,
5000 meter range.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.691
We've eliminated the risk, guesswork
and human error.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.568
I like the color,
can I take it for a spin?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.654
Hey, if you guys are interested we're
having a party for investors later.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.448
Detective Villa.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.827
Bree, Bree, slow down.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.455
We're on our way.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.919
When I came home,
I found it like this.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.421
-I think someone's still in there.
-We're here, we're here.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.532
-EMPD, who the hell are you?
-Billy?

15:57.414 --> 16:00.542
Guy's name is Billy Blackmar,
in and out of jail for years

16:00.626 --> 16:03.921
mostly bar fights, aggravated assault,
used to dive with our vic.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.173
Sounds like he's got a short fuse.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.716
That's why we left the cuffs on him.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.761
Don't worry, we'll get him talking.
Just need to find a soft spot.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.471
You're looking at a man
hardened by the sea.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.014
He's a real treasure hunter.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.267
-Not gonna be easy to break.
-Yeah, we'll see about that.

16:17.768 --> 16:21.897
Oh, oh. No, no, no...
I want first crack at this nut.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.039
So Billy, why did you break in?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.210
I get it, I get it.
You don't respect a guy

16:43.293 --> 16:45.337
who spends all day
behind a desk. Right?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.300
I can tell you're warming up to me.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.221
The bruising on his arms
is just lack of Vitamin C.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.598
-Possibly scurvy.
-Or he's just been out in the sun.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.934
I'm just sayin', the man hasn't seen
an orange in six months.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.478
Looks like he's developing
a cataract in his left eye.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.438
Yeah, so?

17:02.521 --> 17:05.899
So I'd prescribe him
the eye patch for him.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.861
Yeah, yeah, an eye patch
would fix him up real nice.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.654
Rosie, are you trying
to build a pirate?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.905
I'm not building one, he is one.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.408
-He's a treasure hunter.
-Yeah, that's what pirates do, Vi.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.325
No.

17:15.409 --> 17:19.496
Bree told us that you used to dive
for treasure with her father.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.665
She said you two had a falling out,
is that true?

17:21.749 --> 17:25.169
Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.253
Okay.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.465
Were you looking for--

17:30.007 --> 17:31.133
Whoa.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.220
Those cuffs bothering you?

17:38.807 --> 17:40.684
What do you say, you and I dance?

17:40.768 --> 17:42.770
-Did he just ask him to dance?
-I believe he did.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.652
You don't like to dance?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.572
Only want you to
show me how you did it.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.074
Did what?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.575
How you drowned him out in the water.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.495
Did you use one hand like this?
Or did you use two hands.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.956
Must be so hard,
all those days out in the water

18:03.040 --> 18:04.458
coming back empty handed.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.794
And then your partner goes off one day

18:06.877 --> 18:08.545
and finds treasure without you.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.755
So you come looking for it.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.759
All you wanted was yours, I get that.
Your share, but now he's dead.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.679
And you're never, ever gonna get it.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.809
Oh, thank you, Billy. I needed that.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.855
Danny was crazy
and I was crazy to believe him

18:26.939 --> 18:28.941
that he could lead me
to those emeralds.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.401
He said we'd find them together.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.529
And he wouldn't give you your share,
you killed him.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.074
No, man. I wised up, okay.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.201
I cleared out of there.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.537
I heard he was
going back out again.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.747
But somebody else
was footing that bill.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.040
Who was footing the bill?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.375
I don't know.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.085
Billy's right about the money.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.755
I looked over Dave's financials,
he was making $5000 cash deposits

18:51.839 --> 18:52.965
every two weeks.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.925
Maybe Dave pissed off
whoever was paying him.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.176
Come on, man.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.553
Hey, Dad.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.806
-Yikes! He's our suspect?
-Yeah.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.142
And who's the guy with him?

19:03.809 --> 19:06.687
Hey. New recruit.
So how's the book going?

19:06.770 --> 19:07.813
Well...

19:12.734 --> 19:13.944
How are you?

19:14.653 --> 19:17.656
I'd be better if I had a crime scene.
Is that too much to ask?

19:19.575 --> 19:21.952
Victim's boat
is floating out there alone

19:22.035 --> 19:23.954
with all the other evidence
that could help us.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.664
I meant, how are you?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.875
Ever since you and Villa got back,

19:27.958 --> 19:29.710
the rest of us can hardly keep up.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.797
We're doing our thing.
Closing cases, catching killers.

19:34.923 --> 19:38.093
Did she get what she needed
in New York? Closure with Eddie?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.054
I think so. I don't know,
we just talk about work.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.931
Because it's safe?

19:44.433 --> 19:48.228
I know how I feel.
Not so sure about her.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.441
Thanks for not telling Pippy
about Gerald,

19:52.524 --> 19:54.151
she's got a lot on her mind right now.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
New life, new career.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.698
Look, I know you worry
that Pippy burned through her savings.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.533
I'm not really worried about her.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.120
In fact, I'm proud of her.
She's all in.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.874
One of the greatest gifts
a mother can give to her children

20:08.957 --> 20:12.211
is the will to go after the things
they're passionate about.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.215
What?

20:16.965 --> 20:18.342
Dave's not just a treasure hunter.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.177
He's a father.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.560
-This thing does that. May I?
-Sure.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.565
Whoa.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.819
-And where did you learn that?
-My dad taught me.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.489
-Who's your dad?
-Captain Hornstock.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.532
He has me in the basement
helping with a case.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.744
So, you're the new recruit, huh?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.288
Yeah, something like that.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.707
Maybe I'll tell my dad
to go easy on you.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.126
-Okay.
-See you around.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.878
Mm-hmm.

20:58.131 --> 21:01.134
- These all of them?
- Yeah, every map my dad made.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.346
Rosie, we had our guys look over these
there's no rhyme or reason.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.267
We've been using the wrong north.
It's not here, it's her.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.605
Magnetic north changes,
but true north is always the same.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.024
And for your father, that was you.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.026
Every parent wants to leave
something behind for their kids.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.237
Now if he had found a treasure,
he would leave some type of way

21:20.320 --> 21:21.863
for you to find where he was diving.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.117
I told you already,
I don't know what it means.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.662
Okay, think of numbers,
think of places, things.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.455
Anything just you two would know.

21:31.873 --> 21:36.086
He used to take me out to Fowey Rock
every year for my birthday.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.087
He insisted on it.

21:37.129 --> 21:41.174
Okay, Fowey Rock. Fowey Rock, so...

21:42.217 --> 21:44.886
We use Fowey Rock as North...

21:45.304 --> 21:47.306
They still don't make any sense.

21:56.565 --> 22:00.360
Here's North and... Bingo!

22:01.695 --> 22:03.530
- X marks the spot.
- You had to say it, didn't you?

22:03.613 --> 22:04.740
Oh, I had to say it.

22:09.870 --> 22:10.746
Wow.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.540
We could've been here sooner except
a certain high maintenance fish

22:13.623 --> 22:15.584
needed its SG levels adjusted.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.920
I can't be a cat lady
so I decided to be a fish lady.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.757
I want you guys swab the inside
and out for DNA and trace evidence.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.758
Full tox on all.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.593
- You again?
- Me again.

22:24.926 --> 22:25.886
I towed the boat here

22:25.969 --> 22:28.305
because I heard the quickest way
to a detective's heart

22:28.430 --> 22:29.931
is to give her a crime scene.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.727
I heard Coastal Patrol
is very persistent.

22:33.810 --> 22:36.063
And for the record,
we're still looking for evidence.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.232
Yo ho, yo ho
A pathologist's life for me

22:39.316 --> 22:40.150
Okay, okay, that's enough.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.277
Is this what happens when you hang out
with dead people all day?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.362
Aye!

22:44.905 --> 22:46.907
Hey, guys, I found blood.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.034
Run it through the PCR amplifier.
Do a quick job.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.161
Last week I rescued
a guy from Cleveland

22:51.244 --> 22:53.205
swimming through
a whole bloom of jellyfish.

22:54.331 --> 22:57.626
-This'd bring most men to tears.
-You should really cover that up.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.837
Blood type doesn't match Dave.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.756
Okay, but it's recent.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.800
So it could tie our suspect
to our crime scene.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.594
Good. 'Cause Hornstock
just found out who was paying Dave.

23:18.438 --> 23:23.110
Oh, Rosie, we're talking 60 billion in
sunken treasures around the globe.

23:23.193 --> 23:27.989
And with Nemo, we won't find
some of it, we'll find all of it.

23:28.615 --> 23:32.119
This is so good, almost as good
as your returns. Count me in.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.871
Oh, Detective.
Are you here to invest too?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.165
Oh, no, no, no. I just came for this.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.835
We'll match that against the
blood we found on the victim's boat.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.629
It'll be strange if you match
when you said you never met the man.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.173
-Is this about that diver?
-Yeah, his name is Dave,

23:45.257 --> 23:46.675
but I think you already
knew that, didn't you?

23:46.758 --> 23:49.177
You see, Dave always made deposits
at the same ATM,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.221
we figured he must've been
paid nearby.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.682
Good thing Cafe Maestro
has security cameras.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.476
-Check that out. Nice shirt.
-I like that one too.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.936
All right,
the party's over for you two.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.021
Or we can take it back to the station.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.442
Your investors won't mind seeing you
being walked out in cuffs, will they?

24:05.735 --> 24:06.736
Okay.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.990
-Dave was helping us.
-Helping you with what?

24:10.949 --> 24:14.619
Nemo's battery life
is worse than my cell.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.707
Sinks like a rock too. I had to send
one down just to find the one I lost.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.084
My probability maps are tip top.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.838
It's... Turns out the ocean's huge.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.675
You needed desperate divers
to rescue your own ROVs.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.553
Dave said he needed the cash for his
daughter. He agreed to keep quiet.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.930
So your investors wouldn't know
you would never find any treasure.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.309
Not true. We might get lucky.

24:38.810 --> 24:39.811
Excuse me.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.858
You think he's admitting to fraud
to cover up for killing Dave?

24:44.941 --> 24:47.527
He's not my favorite kind of guy
but I don't think he's a murderer.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.158
We gotta get back to the water.

25:01.958 --> 25:06.379
It's an electronic metals tester.
Had it flown in from Tampa, express.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.090
Okay, listen up, Professor Pebbles.

25:10.592 --> 25:14.179
Sorry, Dr. Moreno, but the Captain's
not gonna spring for another hour

25:14.262 --> 25:16.056
after I the first time.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.307
This hour's on me.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.518
But you may want
to leave the room.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.729
This instrument could give off
a little bit of radiation.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.356
Not good if you're not used to it.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.899
And what are you looking for now?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.901
Something I think could help you.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.781
I'll be right back.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.538
When my son makes up his mind
there's no arguing with him.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.081
Just like his mother.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.920
Look, I really think it's time
for you to move on.

25:47.754 --> 25:51.716
Gerald, I need you to believe
in yourself as much as I do.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.843
But my lawyers
have thrown out enough money.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.388
Donna, I really think
you've already done enough.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.390
Look at you, swimming around.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.352
I gotta go.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.109
We gotta talk about you and this fish.

26:09.609 --> 26:12.112
You gonna be able to tear yourself
away for Sunday dinner?

26:12.529 --> 26:14.864
You see, that's really
sweet of you to invite me in.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.409
And I'm really glad
that Pippy's back but...

26:17.993 --> 26:20.453
We don't have to pretend
like everything's the same here.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.872
You're a part
of this family, my darling.

26:23.331 --> 26:26.876
There will always be a place
for you at my table.

26:27.711 --> 26:33.300
I'll just have to, I guess, check
Lucy's PH balances before I go and...

26:33.842 --> 26:36.511
'Cause Moorish Idols, when they
get irritated, they get bitey.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.013
Can't have that.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.016
Now she's demanding. Where's she from?

26:41.099 --> 26:44.185
Only places with very high
temperature and acidity.

26:44.269 --> 26:48.189
India or South America.
Oh my God.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.610
-Retest the water from Dave's lungs.
-Absolutely. I was just thinking--

26:51.693 --> 26:53.695
The water didn't look like
it was from the coast of Florida.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.823
Yeah, which we thought was a mistake,
but it was actually totally accurate.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.575
Someone drowned Dave at home,
not at sea.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.493
The crime scene
was in front of us the whole time.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.455
And the marks on Dave's face were
from Lucy fighting off his killer.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.873
I knew I liked her.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.668
Hey, the tox came back
on the blood, but no DNA match.

27:08.752 --> 27:12.839
Look at this. I found dimenhydrinate
super high concentration.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.426
Are you telling me,
he drowned in his own fish tank?

27:16.509 --> 27:19.262
There was no sign of forced entry,
I'm thinking Dave knew his killer.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.598
What's all this?

27:21.681 --> 27:22.682
Credit card statements.

27:23.016 --> 27:26.311
I don't get it. Dave was thrifty
and a creature of habit,

27:26.394 --> 27:27.896
but the night before he died,
he dropped

27:27.979 --> 27:29.439
$200 at some seafood restaurant,

27:29.606 --> 27:31.232
it was like he knew
it was his last meal.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.609
It was a meal he never ate.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.611
An emerald was the only thing
we found in Dave's stomach.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.196
Then he paid for someone.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.699
Rosie, I think Dave had dinner with
his killer the night before he died.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.576
Yeah, killer
had some expensive tastes.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.245
You ever eaten at Fisher restaurant?
They have amazing crab rolls.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.415
They just moved right next door
to Crescent Hotel. Five star joint.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.542
-Professor Pebbles...
-Professor Pebbles...

27:53.463 --> 27:54.381
Hey!

27:54.464 --> 27:56.424
If you don't want me here,
you should've just told me.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.967
I do want you here.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.220
Then why are you acting so weird?

28:00.303 --> 28:03.431
And why am I down here reading a book
about rocks by some whack job?

28:03.723 --> 28:06.142
Look, I know
the guy's a little off, okay?

28:06.226 --> 28:08.853
A little off? He's obsessed
with finding his family's gems

28:08.937 --> 28:10.563
and he thinks
that the Hope Diamond is cursed.

28:11.147 --> 28:14.484
-Wait, wait. Whose family?
-His. The guy who wrote this thing.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.781
-Where's Moreno?
-He just took off.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.116
And he took something with him.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.498
Hotel confirmed that Moreno

28:28.581 --> 28:30.250
checked in the same night
Dave came by.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.043
So we were right.
Moreno is our guy.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.879
Exit on Collins. His boat
is docked at Hallover Marina.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.549
Dave must've called Moreno
to authenticate the emerald.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.468
Moreno thought the emerald was real
and followed Dave home to steal it.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.429
When Dave wouldn't tell him
where it was Moreno drowned him.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.056
-Then tried to cover it up.
-If the emerald belonged to his family

28:45.140 --> 28:47.142
I guess he'd do anything
to protect it.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.185
I don't think we missed him.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.063
Okay, let's just split up.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.361
Ira.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.655
You want to explain to me
how evidence walked out the door?

29:00.697 --> 29:02.323
It's the expert you hired.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.034
-Who you should've been watching.
-Hey, Dad.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.165
Hey, Soph, just give us a second.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.291
What's going on?

29:12.167 --> 29:13.209
Umm...

29:13.793 --> 29:15.253
It's my fault, Captain.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.549
I, uh, I should've been
watching him. It won't happen again.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.805
You're damn right
it's your fault, okay.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.600
This cannot be happening, all right?

29:28.683 --> 29:31.144
I mean, even Raj doesn't mess up
that many times.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.439
All right, look, it's your fault, okay
but we all make mistakes, okay.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.690
You do better next time.

29:36.107 --> 29:39.861
So let's go fill out that paperwork,
Detective. Soph, stay here.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.613
Yes, Dad. Let's go.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.865
Thank you.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.242
Kids need parents they can believe in.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.580
But you better hope
we catch this killer, Detective.

30:15.730 --> 30:16.856
Stay quiet.

30:19.609 --> 30:20.902
The ladder, up.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.613
Come on, go.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.334
Rosie!

30:43.633 --> 30:44.509
Stay there.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.011
You decided to add kidnapping
and theft to your murder charge?

30:47.178 --> 30:48.847
You trespassed on my boat.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.890
You could get off at any time.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.600
We know you met with Dave.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.354
And we had dinner, he told me
about the emerald, that's all.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.189
-I am no killer.
-Oh, really.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.483
You acting a lot like a killer to me.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.528
You got a gun, motive, a getaway boat.

31:03.611 --> 31:07.115
All I want is what belongs
to my family, what's rightfully mine.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.200
You told us
those Katerina emeralds weren't real.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.912
I told you that some experts
don't think they are.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.290
But me, I have always believed.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.958
I should probably thank you

31:17.625 --> 31:20.920
because I never would've found
the rest of the treasure

31:21.963 --> 31:23.172
without your help.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.468
You're not running away, you're gonna
dive for the rest of them.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.555
Si, senor. I was planning
on diving alone,

31:30.638 --> 31:32.807
but it is nice to have some help.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.731
I gotta admit,
I'm a little nervous.

31:40.356 --> 31:42.734
I haven't seen this much action
at sea in a while.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.695
I'm flattered to be
your first call, detective.

31:45.778 --> 31:49.032
You were the first to respond,
there's an important difference.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.617
Can I ask you a personal question?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.828
You and this doctor,
you're more than partners?

31:55.246 --> 31:56.456
He's my partner.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.710
So I need you to show me
how fast this baby goes, okay?

32:09.218 --> 32:10.511
Risking it all for this, huh?

32:10.595 --> 32:12.096
Once I touch that treasure chest,

32:12.180 --> 32:15.099
maritime law says I have
a legal claim to this,

32:15.892 --> 32:17.060
and everything inside it.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.186
That means
after you get out of prison,

32:18.269 --> 32:20.063
there'll be a whole pile
of family jewels waiting for you.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.316
-I didn't kill anyone.
-Let's keep it that way.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.739
-Drop your weapon, EMPD.
-And Coastal Patrol.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.324
I got your back, Detective.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.408
Go on.

32:32.492 --> 32:35.411
Really? 'Cause it looks like
you're about to fall overboard.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.830
I'm good. I'm just excited
to take this guy down.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.501
-You've got the wrong guy.
-Don't do anything stupid.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.253
-I just want what's mine.
-No, no, nobody shoot. Nobody shoot.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.632
Need to tell you all a story.
It's the story about a treasure.

32:47.715 --> 32:48.758
This is not the time.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.635
I think you're gonna like
this one, Villa.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.804
It's a story about our victim Dave.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.640
For years he searched for a treasure.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.850
One day he found an emerald.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.228
Then someone found him.

33:01.604 --> 33:02.897
It was somebody that Dave knew.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.901
But Dave quickly realized
that it wasn't a friendly visit.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.820
The man had come
to take his treasure.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.156
So Dave hid it in the only place
he knew no one ever find it.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.075
But our killer
wouldn't give up.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.119
Things got out of control.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.001
Dave refused to give up
the emerald's hiding place.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.089
Poor Lucy was the only one
that witnessed Dave's final moments.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.552
He drowned in his own fish tank.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.015
Our killer got desperate.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.393
He tried to make it look
like it was a diving accident.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.645
But he left a little
something behind.

33:43.813 --> 33:44.939
A few drops of blood.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.735
Tox revealed that in the blood there
were high levels of dimenhydrinate.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.695
What the hell is that?

33:51.279 --> 33:53.156
You may know it as dramamine.

33:54.073 --> 33:55.450
It combats seasickness.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.663
Now who would you know
that takes high doses

34:01.998 --> 34:03.041
of dramamine?

34:04.500 --> 34:06.502
Someone suffering
from chronic seasickness,

34:09.630 --> 34:13.176
-You think I killed this guy?
-I think you forgot to take dramamine.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.012
You said you had seen Dave before.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.931
But what you left out was that
you knew he'd found something.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.100
That emerald was your ticket out.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.270
Is this because you don't like me
flirting with your partner?

34:24.353 --> 34:27.190
You call it flirting? I call it trying
to stay close to the investigation.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.526
And those aren't jellyfish stings
on your arm.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.487
I bet if we test them,
they match the marks

34:32.570 --> 34:34.322
on our victim's face from the fish

34:35.406 --> 34:36.949
which puts you at the crime scene.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.038
No one's testing anything.

34:48.336 --> 34:51.089
- Give me the gem.
- Gentlemen, put your guns down now

34:51.172 --> 34:52.256
and we can talk this out.

34:52.340 --> 34:56.052
Nine years I've worked Coastal Patrol
saving guys like Dave

34:56.135 --> 34:59.097
and then he stumbles on some
priceless gem and I get nothing?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.849
I don't want to be
a glorified lifeguard anymore.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.017
Give me the gem!

35:03.101 --> 35:04.936
Too bad, it belongs to me.

35:14.654 --> 35:15.655
Relax, relax.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.158
It's empty. I told you,
I am no killer.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.453
Villa!

35:27.291 --> 35:28.334
Looking for this?

35:28.417 --> 35:31.129
Hand it over, Doctor. Unless you want
to end up like your partner.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.885
The moment that you kill me,
my hand is gonna open,

35:37.969 --> 35:40.304
it's gonna drop
straight down to the bottom.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.184
How about you give me that gem,
I let you go?

35:45.935 --> 35:46.936
Here.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.694
-Nice toss.
-Nice tackle.

35:55.194 --> 35:58.197
Sorry, I think, I accidentally threw
one of the air tanks in the water.

35:58.531 --> 36:01.200
Come on now, Karl, you know nobody has
that much air on them.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.119
The bubbles were a give away, man.

36:03.202 --> 36:06.581
Oh, Karl, for me? You shouldn't have.

36:12.753 --> 36:13.838
It's so beautiful.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.133
The DA expects Karl to plead guilty.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.427
It's all over now.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.597
Guess my father finally found
what he was searching for.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.683
-And now it's all yours.
-What?

36:25.766 --> 36:27.226
We'll take care of the paperwork.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.812
I don't think Dave's real dream
was finding treasure.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.106
I think it was giving you
a better life.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.776
My dad believed
I would do great things.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.323
I guess I have to prove him right.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.833
So if the story
of the Katerina emeralds is true,

36:51.542 --> 36:53.169
do you think
there could be more out there?

36:54.253 --> 36:57.256
Don't know, don't care. I am
officially retired from treasure hunt.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.841
-Come on.
-I'm out.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.135
One armed standoff and you give up
your pirate dreams?

37:05.765 --> 37:06.807
No, I like what we have.

37:07.600 --> 37:12.313
-Us, like this, I like it.
-Me too.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.734
-So we good?
-Yeah, we're good.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.362
Almost as good as this view.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.323
So is this our new hang?

37:22.990 --> 37:23.991
Well...

37:24.617 --> 37:27.203
I mean, Rosie, the waitress
brought you a grilled cheese

37:27.286 --> 37:29.038
off the kids' menu
and a Shirley Temple,

37:29.121 --> 37:30.581
neither of which you ordered.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.916
That's an honest mistake.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.710
Although I must admit,
the music playlist needs some work.

37:34.794 --> 37:37.004
Oh, not as much work
as this margarita.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.507
Did they run out of tequila
or do they just not want to share?

37:39.590 --> 37:41.717
Tania, does this bacon
look crispy to you?

37:41.801 --> 37:44.178
My life, this is the worst breakfast
I've had in my entire life.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.848
I ordered my refill like a half hour
ago, I didn't even get it, okay.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.018
You know what, I lost my appetite,
I'm done with this place, okay.

37:58.025 --> 38:03.281
Oh, okay, so twenty on $19.84 bill.
I think his math is off.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.908
Oh, that's just Arthur.

38:06.617 --> 38:10.037
He comes here three times a week,
orders the same breakfast,

38:10.121 --> 38:12.415
always complains and never tips.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.751
-But I don't mind.
-Really? You don't mind?

38:15.835 --> 38:20.464
Oh, no. Because I know sooner
or later, he'll look up and see that.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.594
-Oh, then he'll decide to tip.
-Probably not.

38:25.928 --> 38:27.680
I might get a smile out of him but

38:28.639 --> 38:30.558
until then I'll just keep bringing him

38:30.641 --> 38:33.936
his below average pancakes
and soggy bacon.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.273
-You know, looks pretty crisp to me.
-Right? It does look crisp.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.774
It's crisp?

38:40.359 --> 38:41.193
Ow.

38:41.527 --> 38:42.903
Oh, let me see that. Look.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.866
It's not that deep,
you'll be all right.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.243
Do you have
a first aid kit around here?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.786
Yeah, yeah, in the back.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.955
-In the back? A first aid kit?
-Yeah.

38:53.164 --> 38:57.168
-Villa! They have a first aid kit.
-Great.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.298
So this is our new hang.

39:08.763 --> 39:12.308
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey! Look at you.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.021
-Everything all right?
-Everything's good.

39:17.605 --> 39:21.901
It's just that you've never picked me
up at the Academy before, so...

39:23.819 --> 39:25.279
I need to tell you something.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.657
-You're not captain anymore?
-You knew?

39:28.741 --> 39:29.825
I kind of figured it out.

39:31.243 --> 39:32.370
Why didn't you tell me?

39:32.703 --> 39:35.373
I just wanted to be the kind of cop
you could look up to.

39:36.248 --> 39:40.127
But I made mistakes,
so I'm not the best example anymore.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.131
I let you down, so I'm sorry.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.887
You think I care if you're
in the bull pen or the basement?

39:51.055 --> 39:53.474
You're my dad and I love you.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.602
And no matter what,
I will always believe in you.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.734
I'll be working for you
one day, ain't I?

40:03.943 --> 40:04.985
Oh, definitely.

40:23.796 --> 40:27.091
No, I'm serious, you guys.
Lucy's very smart for a fish.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.260
Well, technically
she did help catch the killers,

40:29.343 --> 40:31.220
so maybe Rosie should hire her.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.763
Oh, don't make fun of Tara.

40:33.013 --> 40:36.058
Oh, wait, do you think
Lucy can learn toxicology?

40:36.142 --> 40:39.103
-Oh, Lord.
-There he is, the sick pad man.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.231
Please tell me that my son
has more than two serving spoons.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.732
Can we talk in private?

40:48.487 --> 40:51.073
We can talk after dinner
about you going through my desk.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.162
You took out a mortgage
on the house without telling me?

40:56.245 --> 40:58.080
It's mine, I don't need permission.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.124
Please tell me that that money
is to help Pippy

41:00.207 --> 41:02.751
and not pay for the lawyer of the man
who should stay in prison?

41:03.419 --> 41:05.004
-Who's in prison?
-Gerald.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.425
-Your boyfriend is in prison?
-He's not her boyfriend.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.803
You said the whole Gerald
thing was done.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.181
I never said that, you believed
what you wanted.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.975
Okay, why am I the only person
who doesn't know what's going on?

41:18.184 --> 41:20.060
-We should probably go.
-Yeah.

41:20.144 --> 41:24.356
Sit down, no one's going anywhere.
We are having family dinner.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.774
No, we are not.
Not until you talk to me.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.818
You really want
to have this conversation? Fine.

41:27.902 --> 41:31.322
The mortgage is to pay
Gerald's attorney $100,000 retainer.

41:32.072 --> 41:34.283
This is not an innocent man.
I wish he was, but he isn't.

41:34.366 --> 41:38.037
I believe that he is and I have
the faith that if we keep looking,

41:38.120 --> 41:41.624
we can find the evidence that we need
to exonerate him.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.751
Evidence doesn't change
the more you look at it.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.836
Your faith in him is misplaced.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.923
Okay, you guys have been
keeping this from me?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.759
Well, you weren't like,
exactly around.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.762
What about your faith in me?

41:54.845 --> 41:58.641
Have you seen the pictures?
Have you seen these pictures?

41:59.016 --> 42:00.017
You see this?

42:00.476 --> 42:05.022
Strangled. Stabbed. Look at that face,
did you see what he did?

42:06.357 --> 42:08.150
He didn't just kill these women.
He made them suffer.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.568
Someone made them suffer

42:09.652 --> 42:13.197
and I intend to find out who
before Gerald loses any--

42:13.280 --> 42:16.742
-You don't even know him!
-I do know him! He is...

42:16.825 --> 42:20.871
He's kind and he's selfless and all
he wants is justice for those girls.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.375
-And how do you know that for sure?
-I just know!

42:29.838 --> 42:31.966
Just get onboard
or get out of the way.

42:32.049 --> 42:34.802
Support or silence,
those are your options.

42:36.136 --> 42:41.016
My mother is throwing
her life away for a murderer.

42:43.811 --> 42:44.895
You will not get my support

42:46.313 --> 42:48.023
and you definitely
won't get my silence.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.152
Then make your own damn dinner.

42:54.029 --> 42:55.030
Mom.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.241
Mom.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.919
Hey, buddy.
Heard you got a new girlfriend.

43:10.713 --> 43:11.964
Feel like sharing?
