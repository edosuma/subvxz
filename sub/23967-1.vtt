01:15.409 --> 01:19.579
SIDNEY: There was a brilliant
way about Velouria.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.980
She had a virginal quality

01:20.981 --> 01:24.717
that contrasted her
ice cold outer shell.

01:24.718 --> 01:29.122
Looking back, I realize that
I was the only one to notice.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.958
Yeah, she was a bitch, for sure.

01:31.959 --> 01:36.062
Her breasts, her cheekbones,
her legs.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.131
She saw it all in the mirror
every morning

01:38.132 --> 01:41.301
and was well aware
of the power held therein.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.771
No one could touch her
or intimidate her.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.140
She rarely looked
anyone in the eye.

01:47.141 --> 01:50.510
I once saw Brad Dorsey,
captain of the soccer team,

01:50.511 --> 01:52.312
crying by his locker.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.815
She dumped him after one date
and took his balls with her.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.786
From that day forward,
he never played sports again.

01:59.787 --> 02:04.791
This was a prime example
of the witchery she cast.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.761
But I wasn't attracted
to her pale beauty.

02:08.762 --> 02:12.065
I was more turned on
by the little girl within.

02:12.066 --> 02:12.967
It was this thought

02:12.968 --> 02:16.269
that I masturbated to
every afternoon.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.173
And not her thighs
or flat stomach.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.976
I imagined her breaking down

02:22.977 --> 02:24.911
and begging me
never to leave her

02:24.912 --> 02:29.115
because I was the only one
who truly understood

02:29.116 --> 02:30.651
the Velouria within.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.452
And when I finished,

02:32.453 --> 02:35.989
I looked at the small puddle
of cum I had generated

02:35.990 --> 02:37.257
and wondered,

02:39.493 --> 02:42.596
"Why did I just
waste this on a table top?"

02:46.000 --> 02:49.569
Um, how old were you
when this story took place?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.304
SIDNEY: I was, um…

02:51.305 --> 02:53.107
6th Grade.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.008
- Ew.
- SENNETT: Sidney,

02:55.009 --> 02:57.076
I asked the class
to write an essay

02:57.077 --> 02:59.112
on the meaning of life.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.581
I thought this was appropriate
for that topic.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.849
SENNETT: Well, it's not.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.618
It was highly inappropriate.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.121
Well… Okay.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.524
She's going to fail you.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.493
I just hate her, you know.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.428
Hey look, I don't like her
very much either

03:15.429 --> 03:17.430
but it doesn't mean
she's a bad teacher.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.466
- She had a book published.
- A romance novel.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.467
(SCOFFS)

03:22.269 --> 03:24.704
But still, you're going
to have to figure out a way

03:24.705 --> 03:26.839
to get a passing grade from her.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.207
You better rewrite those essays.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.442
You know what it is?

03:29.443 --> 03:30.943
It's… It's her…

03:30.944 --> 03:34.981
It's her limited definition
of 20th century writers.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.716
What about… What about
Hunter S. Thompson?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.652
What about David Foster
Wallace, you know?

03:39.653 --> 03:40.987
William Gibson.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.488
You know, someone contemporary.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.990
Sidney.

03:43.991 --> 03:47.060
I went to a meeting earlier
today and I fought for you.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.494
But she thinks
you've targeted her,

03:48.495 --> 03:51.298
and lets face it, she's right.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.068
What if I wrote a novel?

03:55.069 --> 03:56.602
No one's questioning
your ability.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.806
It's your subject matter
that's getting you in trouble.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.474
You know what
they would do to me

04:01.475 --> 04:02.675
if I printed half the stories

04:02.676 --> 04:04.945
you've submitted
for the school paper?

04:08.515 --> 04:10.217
Okay.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.954
Let's say you did write a novel.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.057
What would it be about?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.497
SIDNEY: It's about

04:24.498 --> 04:27.134
a suicide victim
from a small town.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.939
INTERVIEWER: Did you think
when you wrote it

04:32.940 --> 04:36.876
that it would go on to have
this kind of success?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.679
SIDNEY: No, I mean…
I didn't even know

04:39.680 --> 04:41.814
I could make a living
off of it, honestly.

04:41.815 --> 04:46.786
I… I was just hoping
that one person would buy it,

04:46.787 --> 04:49.356
one person would
want to read it.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.291
INTERVIEWER: But millions
of people have bought it.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.359
- Mmm-hmm.
- Millions.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.928
Yeah.

04:55.295 --> 05:01.100
How do you follow up a book
like a suburban tragedy?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.568
I can't think about it that way.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.004
I just keep writing.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.742
And when can we expect
your next book?

05:10.944 --> 05:11.979
Soon.

05:21.889 --> 05:22.989

05:22.990 --> 05:25.625
Dr. Baum says you still
haven't contacted

05:25.626 --> 05:26.792
the therapist you recommended

05:26.793 --> 05:30.130
and that he will reschedule
the MRI again.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.166
Thoughts, comments?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.433
I'll do the MRI.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.568
I'm not seeing a therapist.

not a shrink.

I mean, he just had basically
everything he owned.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.004

06:12.005 --> 06:15.241
I asked him where he was headed.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.945
And he looked at me…

06:18.912 --> 06:21.414
And he just said, "May 25th."

just by looking at him.

about this tall.

08:42.621 --> 08:43.856
Did you happen to see this dog?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.624
Well, it's against
library policy

08:45.625 --> 08:46.892
to allow pets into the building,

08:46.893 --> 08:48.160
so, no.

I wonder what he did
with the dog.

maybe he left it at home

having a lot of sympathy

in public places.

I know why he burned the books.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.351
Why?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.625
Because he wrote them.

when we got there?

10:52.118 --> 10:54.054
You had a paper bag.

10:55.055 --> 10:59.792
It was, uh, wrapped up in tape.

what was in it.

to do about it?

look the same to me.

nothing ever happened.

you laughed in my face.

You were an asshole then.
You're an asshole now.

why I should care.

to meet you, Mr. Hall.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.241
Hey. Uh, what's your name?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.510
My name's Henry Crow.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.246
HENRY: I've read
your book so many times.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.916
Um, it's really affected
the way I think about things.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.184
Is that Crowe with an E?

13:39.185 --> 13:40.620
- Yeah.
- An E, yeah.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.257
I think I know
what I'm supposed to do now.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.460
Sorry, what was that?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.294
"The core of our nation

13:49.295 --> 13:52.297

14:32.672 --> 14:34.673
Sorry for the wait.

are only trouble.

Listen, I gotta go.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.313
A great writer
has just entered the room.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.748
All right, Love you.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.050
Bye.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.119
Sidney, my dear boy.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.722
(INHALES) Don't take this
the wrong way,

14:49.723 --> 14:51.757
I say it as a friend.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.158
You look like shit.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.861
You look like one of those
lost children on milk cartons.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.663
You've been number one
on The New York Times

14:57.664 --> 14:59.465

for eight months.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.166
And still, no smile.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.702
Please, tell me.
What ails you? What can I do?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.771
I'm having
panic attacks, Harold.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.107
That's good. All of my clients
have panic attacks.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.676
Yeah, but you know,
none of your other clients

15:10.677 --> 15:12.211
have my kind of pressures.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.646
None of my other clients
have your kind of talent.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.415
If you weren't
having panic attacks,

15:16.416 --> 15:17.649
I'd be very worried.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.951
No, it's…
It's different this time.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.987
I'm seeing things.
Things that aren't there.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.090
Like right now, it looks like
you're not wearing pants.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.658
I'm not wearing pants.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.861
Sidney, do you know
what I have in this folder?

15:28.862 --> 15:29.862
No.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.663
It's starts
with the letter "P."

15:31.664 --> 15:35.100
- Protest letters?
- No. Not protest letters.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.202
Christ, man!
You've got to get optimistic.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.138

we have worked for.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.242

I'm doing right now.

(SIGHS) My mother.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.641
So, can I get a fucking smile
now or what?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.876
This guy, Francis, uh, Bishop,

16:17.877 --> 16:19.344
should I be worried about him?

16:19.345 --> 16:22.614
Francis Bishop is the literary
equivalent of Valium.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.650
Forget the other guys,
you're a shoo-in.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.719
- That's a good title.
- No.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.087
No, that's a bad title.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.023
That's the worst title
since Gone With The Wind.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.759
More importantly, I'm throwing
a big party tonight.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.127
There's going to be women.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.330
Alcohol.
Women drinking alcohol.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.700
I don't do parties, Harold.
You know that.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.570
Well, that's a damn shame.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.105
Cause you're going to be
the guest of honor.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.707
Even worse.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.211
So, that's a yes?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.897
MELODY: It's late
and I'm confused.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.165
I'm confused about a boy

17:14.166 --> 17:16.835
who writes the most
beautiful stories in his

17:16.836 --> 17:18.204
school newspaper.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.739
I read each one carefully

17:20.740 --> 17:23.075
and paste it in my journal
when I'm done.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.277
And then I think
about approaching him.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.546
But quickly realize
that I'm not very good

17:27.547 --> 17:29.181
at being social.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.251
And he's clearly
not good at being social.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.785
I guess I'd tell him that

17:33.786 --> 17:36.855
he's the most talented person
I've never met…

17:36.856 --> 17:39.558
But I have met him.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.827
Maybe that was a dream.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.963
Love, Melody.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.802
I don't think anyone named
Melody goes to this school.

You know, Melody might not
even be her real name.

the handwriting at all?

17:56.109 --> 17:58.343
It's nice. It's very elegant.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.080
I should only be so lucky
with my students.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.883
(SIGHS) What do you think?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.519
I mean, what should I do?
Who is she?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.988
Maybe you already met her.
Have you met anyone recently?

18:09.989 --> 18:11.857
Not really, I mean…

18:11.858 --> 18:13.859
I have to find her, though.

about his dying grandfather.

47:54.572 --> 47:56.106
have written that story.

47:56.107 --> 47:59.876

where he copied it from.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.212

48:02.080 --> 48:04.482

I have a theory

48:22.400 --> 48:25.469
that he's been burning copies
of his books

48:25.470 --> 48:29.973
in libraries and bookstores

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:17.026
It's a New York ID.
953383.

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:21.731
That's Brett Newport.
953383.

01:09:05.075 --> 01:09:06.508
Good evening, ma'am.

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.609
My name is Duane Jones.
I teach English

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.379
at the high school.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.448
Something wrong?

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.881
Oh, no. No, no.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.216
Not at all.
As a matter of fact,

01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:17.586
Sidney's one of our
brightest students.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.456
I was wondering
if I could speak with him.

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:22.859
Make it quick.
He's grounded.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.901
Well, I'm not
getting any younger.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.435
(CHUCKLES)

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:36.238
I almost got in an accident
on Route 9

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.906
because my mind
was so scattered.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.707
And I was…

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:42.029
I was thinking about you and
all the trouble you get me in.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.348
I hope you appreciate it.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:50.051
Why didn't you tell me
you started writing a book?

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:51.520
(STUTTERING) Oh, I don't know.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.257
It's just something
I was working on.

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:57.527
I thought I'd ask you…

01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:00.262
I was curious about your…

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:01.664
Your thoughts on it.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:05.701
Well, I've read
what you have this far.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:09.205
And I thought it was…

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:13.543
Manipulative.

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:17.079
It manipulated me
through the first chapter.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.250
It forced me through the second.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.320
It dared me to reach the third.

01:10:25.055 --> 01:10:26.889
It was honest.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.725
Personal. Valid.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:30.859
I loved it.

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.262
I wanna know what happens next.

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:35.197
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.300
Of course, your choice
of subject matter

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:41.504
is… It's a bit
controversial.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.339
And as brilliant
as the pages are right now,

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.707
you're gonna get
some heavy criticism

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.176
for it down the road.

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:49.945
Down the road?
What do you mean?

01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:50.680
Uh…

01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:55.818
I took it upon myself
to send your pages out

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:58.387
to some friends of mine

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:01.858
who are in
the publishing business.

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:07.830
(STUTTERING) Um,
but did anyone respond?

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.232
Yes.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:10.967
Uh, who?

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.269
Porter House.

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:15.771
Porter House?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:16.905
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:19.041
(STUTTERS) What did they say?

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.810
They said it was strong.

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:24.179
They want to meet with you
as soon as possible.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.615
There could be money involved.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:28.650
- Really?
- Yeah,

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.919
now, uh, any situation

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.190
a professional writer would
call upon someone to, uh,

01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:39.428
hold meetings, negotiate
and things like that.

01:11:39.429 --> 01:11:42.998
And seeing as how you're
inexperienced in those…

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:45.267
Those sorta things, um…

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:47.736
I was just wondering if…

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:49.739
Just wondering if…

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.908
You wanna be my agent?

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:54.243
Yes.

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:55.612
(CHUCKLES) Uh…

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:59.448
- If you'd have me…
- Please, please, yes.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:01.850
- Of course.
- That's great.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:03.585
This is great.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:06.121
Blowing my mind. I don't even
know what to say right now.

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:08.056
We'll meet with them
tomorrow at 1:00.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.894
1:00? What about class?

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.430
Fuck it.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:17.967
OFFICER: Brett Newport.

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:21.704
Newport.

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.806
You posted bail.

01:13:05.949 --> 01:13:07.317
Mr. Hall?

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.765
You bailed me out?

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:29.439
Well, what do you want?

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.076
I'd like to

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.845
ask you some questions

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:39.382
Are you hungry?

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:44.886
There's a diner
just down the road and if…

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:47.155
If you're hungry,
I'd like to buy you a meal.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.523
Look, man.

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:52.794
You wanna take me
out on a date or something?

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:55.330
That's cool. I'm easy.

01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:57.165
You're just gonna have to
get my dog out too,

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:59.468
otherwise I'm not
going anywhere.

01:13:59.469 --> 01:14:01.838
I've already taken care of that.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.779
Okay, let's eat.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.090
Hmm.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.393
Mr. Hall, I've been
searching for you

01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:26.462
for the better half of a year.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.398
I'm a big fan.

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:31.800
I've studied
both of your novels.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.236
Suburban Tragedy
and Stay of Execution.

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:35.605
I…

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:39.074
I find them to be

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.910
extraordinary forms of map work.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.713
Map work, huh?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.049
You're a psycho fan, aren't you?

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.350
No. No.

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:50.485
Well, I mean, maybe a little.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:54.823
Life isn't very interesting if
we're not a bit psychotic.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:55.958
Look…

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.796
I'm, uh…
I'm not a writer anymore.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:02.064
You understand what I'm saying?

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:03.165
I don't have any money.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.733
I, uh… There's nothing
I can give you.

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:06.802
That's not what interests me.

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:09.438
I've come here
with the intention of

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:11.541
presenting you with a deal.

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.945
In return for me
posting your bail,

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.848
I would like to ask you a favor.

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:22.851
However, I need you
to say yes to this favor

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:26.488
before I actually tell you
exactly what it is.

01:15:26.489 --> 01:15:29.826
No. No way. You have to
tell me what it is first.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:36.198
You're not really in a
position to bargain, Mr. Hall.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:40.302
Your propensity for starting
fires in public places.

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:42.637
Has you at a disadvantage.

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.140
But don't worry, what I ask you,

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:46.708
it will not take long.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:49.211
Oh, great, now why'd
you have to go and say that…

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:52.547
First it was a favor, and now
it's a time-consuming favor.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:53.749
Well, there's nothing
to be afraid of,

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:55.851
it may even be therapeutic.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:57.152
Therapeutic?

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:59.321
Do you have any idea
what kind of fucked up things

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:00.422
I'm imagining right now?

01:16:00.423 --> 01:16:02.124
- Then I suggest you say yes.
- Yes!

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:03.759
Sure! Jesus Christ,

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.627
just tell me what it is before
I have a heart attack already.

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:07.864
I want to write a book
about you.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.365
Say again?

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:13.903
I want to write
your biography. Your life.

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:18.540
You want to write a book
about me?

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:20.509
I would like to write a book
about you.

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:22.244
Absolutely not.
No. No, no, no.

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.512
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:25.080
Have you ever written
anything before?

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.015
I know what you've written.

01:16:26.016 --> 01:16:28.316
You're one of the best writers
of our time.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:30.352
Don't get ahead of yourself,
I'm not…

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:31.653
That would be Francis Bishop.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:33.321
Have you ever read
Francis Bishop?

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.756
Won the Pulitzer
the year I was nominated.

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.024
Maybe he didn't deserve it.

01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:38.994
No, he, uh,
he deserved it all right.

01:16:38.995 --> 01:16:41.797
His follow-up book was
proof enough of that.

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:45.167
My follow-up was
self-indulgent and pretentious

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:46.234
so if you want to write about

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:47.436
the greatest writer of our time

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:50.172
(CLEARS THROAT)
I suggest you write about

01:16:50.173 --> 01:16:51.873
(SIPS) Francis Bishop.

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:53.508
No, I'm no good at
autobiographies…

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:56.012
Look, I don't know what
to tell you then.

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:01.818
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:09.025
You're Francis Bishop?

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:16.531
Nah. The badge you flashed me.

01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:18.134
The badge.

01:17:19.402 --> 01:17:21.403
To tell you the truth,
I got this at a dollar store

01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:22.704
and it must be
a very good replica

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:24.172
because I've never had
a single person

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:25.740
ask me a question about it.

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:28.176
A dollar store?
You mean like "Just-a-Buck"?

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:29.278
"Just-a-Buck."

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:31.680
(LAUGHS)

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:33.315
Hold on… Do you mind
if I see this?

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:34.717
No, please.

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:39.087
Oh, my God. This is not real.

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:42.257
This is fake. You're not
fucking lying.

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:44.660
- No.
- (LAUGHING)

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.997
How many people have
you shown that to?

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.133
Just about everyone from here
to New York City. (LAUGHS)

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.603
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.305
Wait. Wait, you impersonated
an officer of the law.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:17:58.773
You know that's illegal, right?

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.943
I showed that to real police,
they didn't even flinch.

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:03.645
You're crazy, man.
I thought I was fuckin' nuts.

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:04.713
You're fuckin' crazy.

01:18:04.714 --> 01:18:05.681
You know, I always wanted to

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:06.948
get into
investigative journalism,

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:09.284
I never really did,
but I went full out on this.

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:12.454
And/or it could have something
to do with a mid-life crisis,

01:18:12.455 --> 01:18:13.788
I'm not sure which. However,

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:16.392
- nonetheless, here I am.
- (LAUGHING)

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.998
Wow.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:29.604
- You have a family?
- A son.

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:31.307
Very handsome son.

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:39.015
(TRAIN RATTLING)

01:18:57.934 --> 01:18:58.934
(SIGHS)

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:01.237
MELODY:
What are you doing here?

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:04.707
Visiting my wife.

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:07.743
Well, she's busy.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:14.850
What is that?

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:25.962
You found it?

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:28.831
I bought it.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:31.734
For you.

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:35.870
And we can go there
whenever you want.

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.974
We can go there right now.

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.477
It's yours.

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:46.615
You wanna go there right now?

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:49.051

in my entire life

01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:22.002
- that means anything to me.
- Don't give me that bullshit!

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:26.607
Everything is your business.
You go through my things.

01:32:26.608 --> 01:32:28.542
(STAMMERS)
You breathe down my neck!

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:30.578
I can't… I can't breathe
when I'm around you!

01:32:30.579 --> 01:32:32.780
I've put every dime
I've ever earned,

01:32:32.781 --> 01:32:34.081
I have put towards you!

01:32:34.082 --> 01:32:36.016
That's Dad's money.
It's called disability.

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.952
- It's not bullshit!
- (OPERATING LEVER CRANKS)

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:40.655
- Get the fuck away from me.
- All right.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:46.927
You got to be fucking
kidding me.

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:48.929
This can't be fucking happening.

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.265
You wanna hit me?
You wanna slap your son?

01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:54.201
- Come on, do it again.
- Don't you disrespect me!

01:32:54.202 --> 01:32:55.337
Oh!

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:59.306
Maybe this is a blessing
in disguise.

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:01.442
We can finally talk about

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:04.278
the things we never
get to talk about.

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:05.981
I'm feeling claustrophobic.

MRS. HALL: You don't get to
choose when you leave me!

You don't get to choose.

01:33:14.991 --> 01:33:16.824
When I had you,
I didn't have a choice!

01:33:16.825 --> 01:33:18.826
I didn't get a choice
when I had you!

01:33:18.827 --> 01:33:20.928
- You don't have a choice!
- FATHER: Stop.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:24.532

(PANTING)

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:20.789
Is it because of the journals?

It's not just one thing, Mom.

It's not in here.
It's not in your purse.

01:34:56.992 --> 01:35:00.228
All right. Did you leave
it at the restaurant.

01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:03.097
All right, just listen.
Breathe.

01:35:03.098 --> 01:35:05.032

of here real soon, all right?

My wife and I have been
trapped in the elevator

01:35:27.656 --> 01:35:30.057
for quite some time now.
She has asthma.

but it might take a few, okay?

the day before.

01:37:00.482 --> 01:37:01.749
We'll get some dinner,

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.485
I'll take you out
with all your buddies.

to Taos General Hospital,
in Taos, New Mexico.

01:37:16.865 --> 01:37:18.332
This is the first time that

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:21.335
the notoriously reclusive
Mr. Hall has been heard from

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:23.203
or seen in public
in over seven years.

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:26.608
Those at the hospital
say his condition is critical.

01:37:30.145 --> 01:37:31.145
Hello?

- (RAIN POURING)
- (THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:37:36.751 --> 01:37:37.951
DOCTOR:
When he gained consciousness,

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:40.054
we asked him
who he wanted us to call.

01:37:40.055 --> 01:37:41.455
You were the only one
he mentioned.

01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:43.323
You're the only person
he wants in the room.

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:45.159
What happened to him?

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.061
DOCTOR: There are indications
of scarring

01:37:47.062 --> 01:37:48.562
on the right side of his brain.

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:50.431
His liver is barely functioning.

01:37:50.432 --> 01:37:53.500
And he has a history of
seizures. Simply put…

01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:58.605
He's been going for years with
no medication or treatment.

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.607
Is he going to be all right?

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:03.110
His body is failing
him, Mr. Bishop.

01:38:03.111 --> 01:38:05.412
But his mind still seems sharp.

01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:08.483
He claims it's the comfiest
bed he's slept in, in years.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:19.260
Well, I guess I'll go in then.

01:38:53.495 --> 01:38:57.298
This is the home we've
been waiting for, all right?

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:02.070
I haven't seen her in
a long time.

01:39:04.739 --> 01:39:06.608
Almost forgot.

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:10.078
I swore I'd never forget this.

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:22.323
(THUD)

01:39:29.197 --> 01:39:30.798
Mr. Hall.

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:35.036
Call me Sidney, for fuck's sake.

01:39:37.172 --> 01:39:38.406
Okay.

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.508
Where's Homer?

01:39:41.509 --> 01:39:43.044
He's at the house.

01:39:44.379 --> 01:39:47.047
I promise you
I'll take care of him

01:39:47.048 --> 01:39:48.582
until you get out of here.

01:39:48.583 --> 01:39:51.119
You see that, right there?

01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.422
There's a package…

01:40:01.062 --> 01:40:05.165
It's just a portion of
my writings.

01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:10.737
And scribblings. Just stuff
from over the years.

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:13.974
It's yours if you want it.

01:40:13.975 --> 01:40:15.710
Use it.

01:40:16.778 --> 01:40:19.614
Do what you want with it.

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:36.130
There are three reasons why
I called you here today.

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:39.900
One is that…

01:40:39.901 --> 01:40:42.570
I want you to write
this little book of yours.

01:40:44.873 --> 01:40:45.773
Two.

01:40:45.774 --> 01:40:49.576
…is that there's something
I never documented

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:52.113
that I need to get off my chest.

01:40:53.581 --> 01:40:56.117
And the third is…

01:40:57.485 --> 01:41:00.555
You're the only person I know.

01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:03.691
Where do you want to start?

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:06.260
SIDNEY: We'll start
with the person

01:41:06.261 --> 01:41:08.596
Suburban Tragedy is based on.

01:41:10.632 --> 01:41:14.701
His name was Brett Newport.

01:41:14.702 --> 01:41:17.772
And this is how I killed him.

01:41:18.973 --> 01:41:20.608
(CLANKS)

01:41:37.992 --> 01:41:40.027
What's in it?

01:41:40.028 --> 01:41:41.995
None of your business.

01:41:41.996 --> 01:41:44.831
Here, hide this. Now! Go…

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:46.466
BRETT'S FATHER: Get out
of the car!

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:50.404
Remember, you hold the key.
All right… You hold the key!

01:41:50.405 --> 01:41:53.573
He wasn't in school on Monday.

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.676
He was probably grounded
and beaten,

01:41:55.677 --> 01:41:58.812
which would have explained
the bruises I saw on his face

01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:00.248
later that week.

01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:04.451
Hey, so, um,
you still have that thing?

01:42:04.452 --> 01:42:07.888
Yeah. Yeah.
I can bring it

01:42:07.889 --> 01:42:10.158
to the finals on
Monday if you want.

01:42:12.927 --> 01:42:16.763
I stared at that lunch box
for over half an hour.

01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:19.833
What was the best way
to go about this?

01:42:19.834 --> 01:42:23.704
Melody was still forefront
on my mind.

01:42:23.705 --> 01:42:27.074
Somehow I felt obligated
to bring closure

01:42:27.075 --> 01:42:28.943
to this current development.

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:38.618
Even now, deep down I knew
that once I opened that box,

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:41.088
it would ultimately not be
the ending

01:42:41.089 --> 01:42:44.524
or rather the beginning
of something very unfortunate.

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:45.927
BRETT: Did you watch it?

01:42:50.298 --> 01:42:52.700
Look man, it's, uh…

01:42:53.968 --> 01:42:56.436
It's really none of my business.

01:42:56.437 --> 01:42:58.539
Did you watch it?

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:11.651
There, documented on video

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:13.253
was Brett's Father,

01:43:13.254 --> 01:43:18.859
Judge George Newport, having
sex with an underage girl.

01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:20.727
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON VIDEO)

01:43:20.728 --> 01:43:22.929
And when it was finally over,

01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:27.567
he would arrange for a car
to take her back to school,

01:43:27.568 --> 01:43:30.338
middle-school by
the looks of it.

01:43:32.807 --> 01:43:36.143
And then just minutes
after the Judge left,

01:43:36.144 --> 01:43:38.212
it all came together.

01:43:48.489 --> 01:43:49.757
(STATIC)

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:52.826
(TAPE EJECTING)

01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:53.895
Smart kid.

01:43:54.662 --> 01:43:55.762
Who would have known

01:43:55.763 --> 01:43:57.330
underneath that football helmet

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:58.999
was such a damaged soul.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.903
A soul that may well have been
on its way to greatness

01:44:02.904 --> 01:44:05.906
had it not been stilted
by an upbringing

01:44:05.907 --> 01:44:09.709
I couldn't even begin
to imagine.

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:11.311
BRETT: I'm gonna kill him,
I swear to God,

01:44:11.312 --> 01:44:12.746
next time he tries to touch me,

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:14.548
I'm gonna take a knife

01:44:14.549 --> 01:44:16.450
and I'm gonna stab him
in his fucking neck.

01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:17.985
SIDNEY: Okay, look, man,

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.054
if you turn the tape
in to the authorities,

01:44:21.055 --> 01:44:24.792
he won't be around anymore.
You know?

01:44:26.527 --> 01:44:28.762
He rapes Darcy…

01:44:28.763 --> 01:44:29.896
Okay. You're going to have to

01:44:29.897 --> 01:44:31.431
turn in the tape
as soon as possible.

01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:32.866
She doesn't say anything,
but I know he does it, man.

01:44:32.867 --> 01:44:35.936
Because I can hear her cry,
some nights, through the wall.

01:44:35.937 --> 01:44:38.905
Listen.
Listen, this has to end.

01:44:38.906 --> 01:44:40.674
All right. This has to end

01:44:40.675 --> 01:44:44.112
and that's why
we dug it up. Right?

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.781
That's why we dug it up.
So this can end.

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:49.549
I'm gonna stab
the fucking bastard.

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:51.952
Listen to me, man,
don't do anything stupid.

01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:55.288
Alright? Just wait until
Monday, we'll turn it in.

01:44:55.289 --> 01:44:56.724
I'll go in with you.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.127
Okay? I'll go with you.

01:45:01.496 --> 01:45:04.131
I should have turned
that tape in.

01:45:04.132 --> 01:45:05.932
I should have listened
to his words

01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:09.002
and taken them more seriously.

01:45:09.003 --> 01:45:10.137
But I didn't.

01:45:10.138 --> 01:45:12.707
- This is Melody.
- Hi.

01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.378
Are those my notebooks?

01:45:18.379 --> 01:45:20.114
What's going on?

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:26.420
I found this in your VCR.

01:45:27.355 --> 01:45:29.556
No… No,
it's not what you think.

01:45:29.557 --> 01:45:31.037
MRS. HALL:
I don't know what to think.

01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.093
I mean,
I don't know if it's porn

01:45:33.094 --> 01:45:35.228
or some black market S'n'M shit

01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:38.765
but it is much sicker than
I imagined you to have.

01:45:38.766 --> 01:45:40.700
You know.
And after watching this,

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.335
I thought I better
read your journals,

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:45.605
because I better get
some insight into my son.

01:45:45.606 --> 01:45:49.042
And all I read about
was drugs and masturbation

01:45:49.043 --> 01:45:51.044
and black high school teachers,

01:45:51.045 --> 01:45:54.281
and let's not forget about
the beautiful passages

01:45:54.282 --> 01:45:55.649
about your mother, the whore!

01:45:55.650 --> 01:45:56.816
The high school cheerleader

01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:58.618
that got knocked up
by the tight end.

01:45:58.619 --> 01:45:59.886
You don't understand, all right?

01:45:59.887 --> 01:46:01.755
- Just give me…
- Don't understand?

01:46:01.756 --> 01:46:03.223
- Stop it.
- Fuck you!

01:46:03.224 --> 01:46:04.457
No! No! No!

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:06.026
You will learn about respect

01:46:06.027 --> 01:46:08.695
when you write
about your mother!

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:11.798
Maybe next time
you'll think twice!

01:46:11.799 --> 01:46:16.204
- No! No! Stop it! Stop it!
- Oh, fucking…

01:46:20.007 --> 01:46:22.043
(PANTING)

01:46:35.156 --> 01:46:37.525
(SOBBING) No. No.

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:50.971
SIDNEY: Brett called me to
ask when we should meet up.

01:46:50.972 --> 01:46:53.473
And I had to tell him
the tape was gone.

01:46:53.474 --> 01:46:54.942
And he hung up on me.

01:46:56.210 --> 01:46:59.746
He died on an unusually
cold Sunday.

01:46:59.747 --> 01:47:02.849
Stabbed himself, in the stomach.

01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:04.184
(TAPE RECORDER CLICKS)

01:47:04.185 --> 01:47:05.652
There were rumors

01:47:05.653 --> 01:47:09.222
that he did it to
avoid military school.

01:47:09.223 --> 01:47:10.690
But I knew the truth.

01:47:10.691 --> 01:47:11.993
(CLICKS)

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.195
I killed him…

01:47:15.663 --> 01:47:17.498
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:47:20.568 --> 01:47:22.236
You can't blame
yourself for that.

01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:26.507
I may not have been there
when the knife went in,

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:31.344
but I was there ever since.

01:47:31.345 --> 01:47:34.348
He's been with me.

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:39.552
I know the entire
course of a person's life

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:43.357
can change, in a millisecond.

01:47:44.959 --> 01:47:47.861
(WHEEZING) Do something.

01:47:47.862 --> 01:47:50.864
- Do something. Do something.
- I'm trying to.

01:47:50.865 --> 01:47:53.066
I'm trying to,
let me do something.

01:47:53.067 --> 01:47:54.701
(GASPING AND WHEEZING) Sing.

01:47:54.702 --> 01:47:56.469
- Sing what?
- Sing…

01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:58.505
- Sing?
- Sing.

01:47:58.506 --> 01:48:00.573
What do you want me to sing?
What do you want me to sing?

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:02.075
I'll sing anything you want.

01:48:02.076 --> 01:48:05.512
- (CRYING)
- All right… I'll sing.

01:48:05.513 --> 01:48:07.347
- I will.
- (SNIFFLES)

01:48:07.348 --> 01:48:09.683
Yeah… (STUTTERS)

01:48:09.684 --> 01:48:15.789
If today was not
a crooked highway

01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:17.157
(LAUGHING)

01:48:17.158 --> 01:48:23.564
If tonight I could
finally stand up tall

01:48:25.333 --> 01:48:31.805
If tomorrow wasn't
such a long time.

01:48:31.806 --> 01:48:36.042
Then lonesome would
mean nothing to me at all

01:48:36.043 --> 01:48:39.079
Stay with me…
Stay with me…

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:46.286
If only my love was
standing by me

01:48:46.287 --> 01:48:48.154
(WHEEZING CONTINUES)

01:48:48.155 --> 01:48:52.960
If I could hear her
heart a-softly poundin'

01:48:54.962 --> 01:49:00.834
If only she was lyin' by me

01:49:00.835 --> 01:49:05.839
I'd lie in my bed

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.375
Once again

01:49:08.376 --> 01:49:10.043
Stay with me.

01:49:10.044 --> 01:49:11.845
I only know the first verse.

01:49:11.846 --> 01:49:13.646
I don't know the second verse.

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.014
You want me to keep singing,

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:16.617
I'll keep singing for you.

01:49:19.353 --> 01:49:26.459
If today was
like a crooked highway

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:34.033
If tonight I could
finally stand up tall

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:39.673
If tomorrow wasn't
such a long time

01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:47.114
Then lonesome would mean nothing

01:49:48.616 --> 01:49:50.150
To me at all

01:49:50.151 --> 01:49:55.822
Breathe. Honey? Honey?
Sweetheart…

01:49:55.823 --> 01:50:02.430
Mel? Mel? Mel…
Wake up. Come on, breathe.

01:50:04.598 --> 01:50:06.133
Oh, no.

01:50:09.303 --> 01:50:11.739
(INAUDIBLE)

01:50:50.945 --> 01:50:52.413
(SNIFFLES)

01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:57.951
SIDNEY: Once Melody left me,

01:50:59.053 --> 01:51:00.553
it dawned on me,

01:51:00.554 --> 01:51:04.724
looking out at all those
wonderful city lights,

01:51:04.725 --> 01:51:09.762
that I was just one of those
millions of city lights,

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:12.366
a tiny little pixel,

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:16.569
buried within
the white noise of life,

01:51:16.570 --> 01:51:22.075
blinking on for just
a brief second in time.

01:51:27.114 --> 01:51:29.549
I didn't want to be a martyr.

01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:31.685
I wanted to be nobody.

01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:38.057
And I walked out
of that apartment

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:41.094
with only the clothes
on my back.

01:51:42.396 --> 01:51:44.732
To become nobody.

01:51:45.733 --> 01:51:48.101
I never returned again.

01:51:57.978 --> 01:52:00.681
(INAUDIBLE)

01:52:25.773 --> 01:52:30.277
I just keep replaying
that scene.

01:52:31.245 --> 01:52:37.284
Hoping against hope
that the ending would change.

01:52:37.585 --> 01:52:43.890
That she would just wake up…

01:52:43.891 --> 01:52:47.127
And say, "Sidney…

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:48.862
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:52:52.901 --> 01:52:55.903
"I'm not leaving you just yet.

01:52:59.874 --> 01:53:02.509
"I'm still pregnant."

01:53:13.221 --> 01:53:15.288
Sidney.
