WEBVTT

00:02.937 --> 00:04.837
What's this one called?

00:04.839 --> 00:06.071
A platypus.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.406
It's ugly.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.508
Bri, I'm looking for a pet

00:09.510 --> 00:11.610
not a date to the prom.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.347
What are you guys looking at?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.383
It's a book
about animals of the world.

00:17.385 --> 00:21.320
ALF's trying to decide which one
he wants to get for a pet.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.956
We already have a cat.

00:23.958 --> 00:26.725
But you told me
to never play with my food.

00:27.962 --> 00:30.596
Why do you want a pet?

00:30.598 --> 00:32.564
Why does anyone want a pet?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.900
The ultimate in power trips.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.870
Bugs him
that I'm taller than he is now.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.639
Well, power trips aside

00:40.641 --> 00:42.207
there's no room in this house

00:42.209 --> 00:44.376
for another pet
just at the moment.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.545
Precisely why
I'm leaning towards a pet

00:46.547 --> 00:48.447
we could keep outside.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.984
i.e. your basic barnyard horse.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.019
Here's the '89 Mustang.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.889
We won't be getting a horse

00:56.891 --> 00:59.858
or any other
barnyard-type animal

00:59.860 --> 01:01.326
for that matter.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.595
Thank you.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.698
Let's wait until after dinner
to broach the buffalo.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.637
[theme music]

01:39.400 --> 01:42.601
[music continues]

02:10.231 --> 02:12.431
[instrumental music]

02:13.467 --> 02:15.033
Yeah. Yeah. Yee-haw.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.668
Uh, ooh. Oh.

02:16.670 --> 02:20.239
Whoa, whoa, boy. Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.341
I'mma not gonna fight

02:22.343 --> 02:24.476
unless you take off
that funny hat

02:24.478 --> 02:27.412
with the buckle on it, pilgrim.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.618
Oh, not again.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.955
Get me a horse,
or you're dead where you stand.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.992
If you could, uh, dismount
for a moment

02:39.994 --> 02:41.927
there's something
I'd like to show you.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.864
Alright. This saddle's
giving me splinters anyway.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.599
Whoa, boy, whoa!

02:49.570 --> 02:52.671
I decided it might be good
for you to have a pet after all.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.807
Oh, thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

02:55.809 --> 02:58.143
I'll feed him oats every day.

02:58.145 --> 03:02.447
I'll even name him after you.
White Beauty.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.685
It's not a horse,
but it's something

03:06.687 --> 03:09.454
I think you'll like
just as much.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.457
You got me a pet beach?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.426
Look closer.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.262
Bugs under glass.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.965
It's an ant farm.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.936
You're right, Willie. This is
just like having a horse.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.405
You actually paid money
for this?

03:26.407 --> 03:29.775
I paid 7.99, plus tax.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.843
You were robbed!

03:31.845 --> 03:33.745
An old soda bottle left outdoors

03:33.747 --> 03:36.481
gives you the same effect.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.083
You're missing the point, ALF.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.718
Ants are fascinating.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.688
And with this, you get a chance
to watch them work

03:42.690 --> 03:46.191
and play
in a natural environment.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.693
Willie, you call green windmills

03:47.695 --> 03:50.896
and plastic trees
a natural environment?

03:52.266 --> 03:53.465
Ants don't care about that.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.634
All they want
is a place to tunnel

03:55.636 --> 03:58.670
and dirt
they can call their own.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.606
So where do I fit in?

04:00.608 --> 04:01.807
Well, they're your pets.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.642
You get to feed
and care for them.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.846
And in return, they-they let you
in to their private lives.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.815
They live in a picture window!

04:09.817 --> 04:13.685
What kind of private lives
can they have?

04:13.687 --> 04:16.355
Would you rather I return them?

04:16.357 --> 04:19.891
Could they be exchanged
for something with fewer legs

04:19.893 --> 04:22.060
and a saddle?

04:22.062 --> 04:25.063
[instrumental music]

04:26.400 --> 04:27.966
Okay.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.537
Here, boy.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.741
There you go. Go fetch.

04:35.743 --> 04:39.077
Alright now, bring it back!
Come on!

04:39.079 --> 04:40.612
Hey, I'm over here!

04:40.614 --> 04:42.414
[footsteps approaching]

04:42.416 --> 04:44.383
- Hey, ALF.
- Hey, ALF.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.585
Well, if it isn't
the Tanner kids.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.054
What brings you two
to this neck of the attic?

04:49.056 --> 04:52.424
We just wanted to ask
how your ant farm was going.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.294
- So ask.
- How's it going?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.862
Don't ask.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.464
They're not bonding
like I had hoped.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.900
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.603
I can't get these guys
to do anything.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.905
All they care about
is building tunnels.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.408
But that's what ants do, ALF.

05:09.410 --> 05:13.745
How am I supposed to teach them
to sit and beg and speak?

05:13.747 --> 05:17.683
You're not.
Ants aren't like other pets.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.384
I guess you're right.

05:19.386 --> 05:23.889
It's just that ant-farming
has a tendency to be uneventful.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.693
Sort of like working security
at a Pat Boone concert.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.296
But see, that's the way
mom and dad work.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.565
They start you off small,
and then when you've proven

05:33.567 --> 05:35.467
that you can handle
the responsibility

05:35.469 --> 05:37.803
they'll let you have
something bigger.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.673
So if I take care of these ants,
I could have, what, big ants?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.375
My first pet was a turtle.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.577
Oh, that must've been exciting.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.680
Like watching a rock walk.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.849
Have you read
this question-and-answer section

05:50.851 --> 05:52.284
of your ant-watchers manual?

05:52.286 --> 05:56.021
No. I was saving that
for bathroom reading.

05:56.957 --> 05:57.889
Question.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.791
"Do ants work all of the time?"

05:59.793 --> 06:01.893
Answer,
"No, they work very hard

06:01.895 --> 06:03.829
but they like to play, too."

06:03.831 --> 06:07.499
I think she's right, ALF.
Look at those two.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.568
It looks like they're wrestling.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.670
Get out of town!

06:12.573 --> 06:14.806
Oh, hey! Look at that!

06:14.808 --> 06:18.110
He's got him in a facelock!
He's going to..

06:18.112 --> 06:21.646
Ooh! Ooh,
right against the canvass!

06:21.648 --> 06:24.883
Hey, ALF, look!
Now it's a tag-team match.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.553
Oh! Oh, he's got him
in a 12-Nelson.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.655
That can't be legal.

06:31.325 --> 06:34.326
[instrumental music]

06:37.631 --> 06:40.232
Yo, Kate,
I've got an etiquette question.

06:40.234 --> 06:44.369
Do you throw white
or brown rice at a wedding?

06:44.371 --> 06:46.138
I'd have to say white.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.706
Don't you think, Willie?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.675
Definitely brown.
That'd be gauche.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.811
Thank you.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.782
(ALF)
<i> 'Mazel tov! Mazel tov!'</i>

06:56.784 --> 06:59.551

Hey! Hey, ALF!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.021
(ALF)
'In a second, Willie.'

07:03.023 --> 07:06.324
'I'm taking pictures
for the wedding album.'

07:06.326 --> 07:08.059
Wedding album?

07:10.697 --> 07:12.631
Hey, what's going on in here?

07:12.633 --> 07:15.867
Oh, would you look
at this mess?

07:16.737 --> 07:17.836
Friends of the bride

07:17.838 --> 07:20.071
or friends of the groom?

07:20.073 --> 07:23.308
- What bride? What groom?
- Mattie and David.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.244
The two crazy kids
who just tied the knot.

07:26.246 --> 07:30.348
Hey, come on, you love bugs,
give us a smile.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.520
Willie, look,
something is going on inside.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.722
I think they're dancing.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.891
Well, they're moving.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.061
Well, the couple on the left,
Peg and Bob Becken

07:43.063 --> 07:47.199
they came all the way in
from tunnel nine for this.

07:47.201 --> 07:50.235
Hey, hey, Willie, would you mind
snapping a picture of me

07:50.237 --> 07:51.503
and the wedding party?

07:51.505 --> 07:53.305
I guess not.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.739
Alright, everybody.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.975
Say "Picnic."

07:58.245 --> 07:59.411
Did I blink?

07:59.413 --> 08:01.313
I don't think so, no.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.749
You seem to have changed
your mind about ants, ALF.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.952
I couldn't help it, Kate.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.955
They've made me
a part of their lives.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.624
We've broken bread together.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.392
Well, actually, I broke it.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.062
They just carried it around
on their heads.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.731
Be honest now, ALF.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.533
Aren't you glad
I got you that ant farm

08:21.535 --> 08:24.035
instead of some silly old horse?

08:24.037 --> 08:27.205
Let's be realistic, Willie.
A horse is a horse.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.841
- Of course.
- Of course.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.409
Well, if you'll excuse me

08:31.411 --> 08:33.645
I've got to pick up
some rotting fruit.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.047
I'm catering this affair.

- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Lynn. Is ALF around?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.934
No. I'm waiting for him
so I can show him this calendar.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.137
"Alan Thicke's World Of Ants."

08:59.139 --> 09:01.072
Each month highlights a new ant.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.575
This month
it's the fungus feeders

09:03.577 --> 09:06.378
of South America.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.081
Isn't it amazing how ugly things
get when they're magnified?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.251
Did-did you bring ALF
something, too?

09:13.253 --> 09:15.487
Oh, yeah, I just got
a few little things

09:15.489 --> 09:17.188
to dress up the farm.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.324
There's some plastic cows
and sheep.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.593
I think there's even a tractor
in there somewhere.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.328
[gasps]
He's gonna love these.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.931
- Can I set them up?
- Yeah, sure.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.999
Look at all this stuff!

09:28.001 --> 09:32.070
There's sand refills,
there's liquid feeder.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.606
There's even
a plastic ant model kit.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.342
Uh, careful with that, dad
I think the glue's still wet.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.443
Oh.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.379
Yeah, it is.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.353
Dad, I think there's something
wrong with ALF's ants.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.554
They're not moving.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.989
Well, they're probably scared

09:50.991 --> 09:52.023
because you moved them.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.992
Put 'em back, they'll be okay.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.494
I don't think so.

09:56.496 --> 10:00.265
I neglected to mention they're
also curled up on their backs.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.572
Are they..

10:07.574 --> 10:09.874
- They are.
- Tsk.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.177
I guess it was the sun
that did it.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.312
They've probably been
baking there all morning.

- Hi, ALF.

Hey! An ant calendar.
Thanks, Lynnie.

10:35.068 --> 10:39.137
The boys love reading
about their distant cousins.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.741
ALF, I think there's something
you should know about your ants.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.844
I know, I know. Ants can't read.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.746
It's just a little
anthropomorphic game

10:47.748 --> 10:50.615
I like to play with them.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.085
Actually, I was referring
to something else.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.120
What?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.922
Well, you remember you told me

10:57.924 --> 11:00.058
what happens to orbit gnats

11:00.060 --> 11:03.662
when they fly too close
to your ship's heat shield?

11:03.664 --> 11:06.598
Yeah. Crispy critters.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.101
Well, the same thing
can happen to an ant

11:10.103 --> 11:12.904
when it's left in the sun
too long.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.242
They look dead.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.645
They are dead.

You sure
they're not sun-tanning?

11:32.826 --> 11:36.061
My poor little goombahs.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.559
Eh.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.330
I brought you a sandwich.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.366
Thanks.
But I'm not really hungry.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.070
Okay. Maybe later.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.576
You wanna talk?
I'm trained in this area.

12:24.578 --> 12:28.646
What's there to say?
My friends are gone.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.817
I turned their home
into an Easy Bake Oven.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.086
Case closed.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.122
It was an accident, ALF.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.591
You didn't do it intentionally.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.227
Well, I keep thinking that
none of this would've happened

12:42.229 --> 12:44.763
if I hadn't shampooed, rinsed

12:44.765 --> 12:48.066
and repeated so many times.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.401
People always need a reason
when they've had a loss.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.605
Guilt,
it's a very natural reaction.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.875
- Yeah? What about anger?
- It's very common.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.644
Well, good, 'cause I'm peeved
at you for getting me

12:59.646 --> 13:02.514
that ant farm
in the first place!

13:02.516 --> 13:05.784
Well, that's good, ALF. Let it
out, let it, let it all out.

13:05.786 --> 13:09.354
[breathing heavily]
I'm also mad at you
for not getting me that horse!

13:09.356 --> 13:12.590
Horses are more resilient when
it comes to direct sunlight.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.292
Yeah. Keep going on.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.627
Uh, are you angry
at anyone else?

13:15.629 --> 13:17.562
Yeah, yeah,
now that you mentioned it

13:17.564 --> 13:21.432
CBS, for pulling the plug
on "Frank's Place."

13:24.404 --> 13:26.104
Feeling better?

13:27.174 --> 13:28.740
Actually, no.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.943
If you want

13:31.945 --> 13:34.045
I could get you
another ant farm.

13:34.047 --> 13:38.416
Right, and if Kate kicks,
I'll get you another redhead.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.953
I know it's hard for you
to believe right now

13:41.955 --> 13:44.656
but tomorrow
you're gonna feel better

13:44.658 --> 13:48.059
and then the next day
you'll feel even better

13:48.061 --> 13:51.329
until one day, you'll actually..

13:52.165 --> 13:54.766
...feel better.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.769
Are you sure this is the area
you're trained in?

13:58.939 --> 14:02.140
[instrumental music]

14:04.611 --> 14:06.845
[chuckles]

14:06.847 --> 14:08.613
Kate..

14:08.615 --> 14:09.914
Cut it out.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.015
(Kate)
'Huh?'

14:11.017 --> 14:13.685
[chuckling]

14:13.687 --> 14:16.020
Tickling me.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.256
No, I'm not touching you.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.164
There are ants on me.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.468
There, there are ants
in my pajamas.

14:32.772 --> 14:33.905
There are ants everywhere.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.341
Yes, yes.
I-I can see that, dear.

14:37.611 --> 14:40.979
[clears throat]
I'll just get the bug spray.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.647
I'll help you.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.186
(Kate)
'Why are there so many ants
in the house all of a sudden?'

14:50.156 --> 14:51.689
Perhaps
these strategically-placed

14:51.691 --> 14:53.992
dishes of food
might give us a clue.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.328
Ah, just once I would like
to walk into this kitchen

14:57.330 --> 14:59.530
and not find something
all over the floor.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.066
Just go into the other room,
Kate. I'll-I'll spray in here.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.470
Why don't we just burn
the place down and start over?

15:05.472 --> 15:09.140
That'd be plan B. Plan A is
where's the bug spray?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.175
I threw it away.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.046
Why did you do this?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.448
Do what?
Throw away the bug spray?

15:17.450 --> 15:20.184
Or set up
the teeny-weeny truck stops?

15:21.621 --> 15:23.655
Eventually, you're going
to have to explain both

15:23.657 --> 15:26.891
so start where you like
and stop when I tell you.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.660
I'm dedicating my life

15:28.662 --> 15:32.697
to the care and preservation
of the ant species.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.802
ALF, if you leave food
all over the house

15:37.804 --> 15:40.605
we are going to have ants
everywhere.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.740
It's the least
I can do for them

15:42.742 --> 15:46.210
after I wiped out
their kinfolk and everything.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.113
ALF, inviting the remainder

15:49.115 --> 15:51.482
of the Earth's ant population
into our house

15:51.484 --> 15:54.218
isn't gonna bring back
your ant farm.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.387
But I'll feel better.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.190
ALF, you've got
to get over this.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.427
I failed to protect
my pet ants, Willie.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.196
I'm not gonna fail
with the general ant public.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.332
[sighs]
Trust me, ALF.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.167
Your ants stand
a much better chance of survival

16:09.169 --> 16:11.970
outside of my kitchen.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.638
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.808
Nothing doing.
This time he's mine.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.977
No, wait, wa.. Kate.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.212
ALF might not feel as bad
about losing his ants

16:21.214 --> 16:24.115
if he just had a chance
to say goodbye to them formally

16:24.117 --> 16:27.819
like, you know, uh,
like a memorial service.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.188
A funeral for ants?

16:30.857 --> 16:33.424
What a lovely idea.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.527
- But I don't think it'll help.
- Well, sure it will, ALF.

16:36.529 --> 16:40.999
Rituals are a very effective way
of dealing with grief.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.301
I'm just not up to it.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.503
You'll have a funeral,
we'll all come

16:45.505 --> 16:47.338
it'll be very<i> touching!</i>

16:47.340 --> 16:49.874
[shouting]
And it'll be over,<i> right?</i>

16:51.244 --> 16:52.643
Right.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.680
Then we'll have a picnic.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.952
[instrumental music]

17:06.393 --> 17:08.760
Is this the wreath
you were talking about?

17:08.762 --> 17:10.795
Yes. Thank you.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.631
Where shall I put it?

17:13.633 --> 17:17.235
Anywhere near the tombstones
will be fine.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.015
Very thoughtful.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.650
I thought so.

17:34.888 --> 17:39.624
Kate! Isn't that dress
a little loud for the occasion?

17:39.626 --> 17:43.227
Well, forgive me. I have
no maternity funeral wear.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.664
- Shall we begin?
- We shall.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.100
Please, my friends, sit, relax

17:49.102 --> 17:51.202
make yourselves comfortable.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.004
Can I take off my armband?

17:53.006 --> 17:54.839
No!

17:54.841 --> 17:58.743
Before I start, I would like
to thank Kate Tanner

17:58.745 --> 18:02.547
for the lovely picnic basket
and fixings.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.215
And also Brian Tanner

18:04.217 --> 18:07.351
for helping me eat
all those ice-cream bars

18:07.353 --> 18:10.021
that provided
those lovely headstones.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.824
[clapping]

18:16.229 --> 18:19.564
We gather here today
to pay homage

18:19.566 --> 18:22.233
to a colony of mirth-makers

18:22.235 --> 18:26.537
known affectionately
as my ants.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.842
In five short days

18:30.844 --> 18:32.743
these wiry sexpeds

18:32.745 --> 18:36.447
tunneled a pathway
into our hearts.

18:36.449 --> 18:40.284
Now they rest beside me

18:40.286 --> 18:42.620
symmetrically placed

18:42.622 --> 18:47.024
victims of an unkind midday sun.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.364
At this time
it would be appropriate

18:53.366 --> 18:57.502
to say a few kind words
in their memory.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.404
Willie, would you start us off?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.676
Uh, yeah. Sure.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.181
I didn't know the ants
as well as ALF.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.416
I don't think anybody did.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.653
But, to me

19:15.655 --> 19:19.257
they embodied the word
"Friendly."

19:19.259 --> 19:23.461
Their house was your house.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.831
I shall miss them.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.038
Well, uh..

19:34.040 --> 19:35.106
Of all the ants I've ever known

19:35.108 --> 19:38.409
they were the most contained.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.582
I'll miss them, too.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.084
They were very industrious.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.853
So long, guys.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.856
[whispers]
Go.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.526
I liked Spunky.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.762
The long one with the big head.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.098
He could really dig.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.971
But, of course,
he was just one of many.

20:06.973 --> 20:11.108
There were Sybil
and Jerry, who worked graveyard

20:11.110 --> 20:14.045
so they could spend their days
with the larvae.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.681
Chad, Tyler

20:16.683 --> 20:20.351
Zach, Logan and Jenna and also--

20:20.353 --> 20:22.653
- ALF.
- Yes, Kate?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.622
- Something to add?
- Uh..

20:24.624 --> 20:26.057
I was just wondering
if your eulogy

20:26.059 --> 20:27.091
was gonna be much longer.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.459
There's a stream of ants

20:28.461 --> 20:30.861
swarming all over the food.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.497
They're mourners, Kate.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.833
No. They're after the chicken.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.703
Okay. I'll cut to the chase.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.706
"Goodbye, Abner, Allen, Alicia

20:41.708 --> 20:45.009
"Amy, Aunt Bee, Auntie Emma

20:45.011 --> 20:47.411
Esther, Est, Eunice.."

20:47.413 --> 20:49.313
[instrumental music]

20:49.315 --> 20:52.516
[ALF chomping]

20:55.588 --> 20:58.122
I see you found
the picnic leftovers.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.558
It's amazing!

21:00.560 --> 21:03.494
I almost got my appetite back.

21:03.496 --> 21:07.031
Amazing.
You ate all that chicken?

21:07.033 --> 21:10.568
Yeah. I didn't even want
the last two pieces.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.004
It was just the momentum.

21:13.006 --> 21:16.207
Well, you seem to be back
to your old self.

21:16.209 --> 21:20.745
I guess. But I still have
this dull ache inside.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.146
You've been through
a great deal of pain

21:22.148 --> 21:23.581
in the last 24 hours, ALF.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.883
It's just your body
responding to that.

21:25.885 --> 21:29.387
Nah. I think
it's Kate's potato salad.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.056
I've had problems with it
before.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.157
[burps]

21:35.461 --> 21:37.995
[instrumental music]

21:42.669 --> 21:44.769
- What's that, ALF?
- It's a letter!

21:44.771 --> 21:47.271
From "The Morton Downey Show."

21:47.273 --> 21:48.973
"Dear Mr. Shumway

21:48.975 --> 21:51.242
"thank you
for your recent suggestion

21:51.244 --> 21:56.080
that we devote a segment
to the civil rights of ants."

21:56.082 --> 21:59.350
Yes! Yes!

21:59.352 --> 22:01.285
"Unfortunately

22:01.287 --> 22:03.621
"we find the topic unsuitable

22:03.623 --> 22:06.457
for our current needs."

22:06.459 --> 22:09.527
No. No.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.530
Wait. There's more.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.265
Uh, "We are, however,
very interested

22:14.267 --> 22:17.401
"in having you appear
on an upcoming segment entitled

22:17.403 --> 22:22.073
'Obsessive Compulsives With
Too Much Time On Their Hands.'"

22:22.075 --> 22:25.009
And Willie said I was crazy
to send that letter.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.648
[theme music]

22:32.752 --> 22:35.953
[theme music]

23:00.313 --> 23:03.314
[ALF laughing]

23:04.283 --> 23:07.284
[instrumental music]
