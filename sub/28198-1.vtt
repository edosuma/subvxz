00:41.309 --> 00:44.845
- You better
run real fast!

00:58.459 --> 01:00.060
- Connor!

01:11.239 --> 01:14.142
- As you all know,
today is October 31st,

01:14.175 --> 01:18.512
which means happy Halloween!

01:19.380 --> 01:22.283
All right, guys, it's also
Clancy's birthday today,

01:22.316 --> 01:24.818
so let's give him a
big round of applause.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.691
Happy birthday, Clancy.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.297
All right, so the
story of Halloween,

01:36.330 --> 01:37.631
you guys, pay attention, please.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.901
It was originally
All Hallow's Eve,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.171
which was the day
before All Saints' Day.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.406
Guys, I really need you
to pay attention here.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.175
It was All Saints' Day.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.876
It's church festivities,

01:48.909 --> 01:51.345
which in Britain,

01:51.379 --> 01:53.547
they would, guys, guys!

01:53.581 --> 01:56.150
Please pay attention, all right?

01:56.184 --> 01:58.552
Now, All Hallow's
Eve was a way of,

01:58.586 --> 02:00.221
more of a church festivity.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.689
It was about,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.257
it was about going out
and celebrating the dead.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.227
Guys, guys, pay
attention here, alright?

02:06.260 --> 02:07.828
Now we've got--

02:07.861 --> 02:09.263
Please stop that!

03:37.751 --> 03:38.986
- Hey, hey!

03:39.019 --> 03:40.321
Stay right there,
stay right there!

03:40.354 --> 03:41.822
I know who you are, okay?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.324
I'm just gonna take
you and your staff

03:43.357 --> 03:45.393
down to the station,
all right, come with me.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.695
Come with me.

04:16.357 --> 04:16.990
- Hi.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.694
I'm Detective Terry Cole.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.267
Would you like water?

04:28.536 --> 04:29.370
A soda?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.975
Oh, perhaps a cigarette?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.448
Before we get started,

04:40.481 --> 04:43.484
let's cover some
basic ID information,

04:44.452 --> 04:45.486
and, um,

04:48.389 --> 04:49.590
what's your birth name?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.559
- Clancy Shrury Keller.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.365
- Do you have a nickname?

04:57.398 --> 05:01.502
- Well, it's ain't Clancy
The Ballerina, now, is it?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.439
Clancy The Clown!

05:08.476 --> 05:10.077
- How did you get that nickname?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.413
- From a family business!

05:12.446 --> 05:13.647
We do what we do.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.517
I'm the clown.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.421
- How old were you
when you first started working

05:20.454 --> 05:21.555
in the family business?

05:21.589 --> 05:25.459
- Now that's gettin' a might
personal, don't ya think?

05:30.464 --> 05:31.832
- Where were you born?

05:31.865 --> 05:34.502
- Apple Creek, Indiana.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.470
- And your date of birth?

05:36.504 --> 05:39.740
- October 31st, 19-none
of your business.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.477
- On Halloween?

05:43.511 --> 05:46.647
- We're all born on Halloween.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.482
- Coincidence?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.518
- Home deliveries.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.085
- All home deliveries?

05:52.119 --> 05:56.123
- Now, you're catchin'
on real quick, Detective.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.427
- Okay,

05:59.460 --> 06:00.494
um, your, um,

06:01.995 --> 06:03.497
your home address?

06:05.899 --> 06:09.637
- We're a traveling
carnival, Detective Cole.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.708
- So you're on
the road all year?

06:14.742 --> 06:16.009
- I believe so.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.912
- Are you married?

06:18.946 --> 06:19.780
- Nope.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.583
- Do you have children?

06:22.616 --> 06:23.651
- Nope.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.523
- So, you're a
traveling carnival.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.893
You, uh, offer rides
and a haunted maze?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.465
- That is correct.

06:37.498 --> 06:41.735
I get paid to creep and greet
the hell out of the public.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.614
- You creep
and freak people out,

06:53.647 --> 06:54.482
in order to kill 'em, right?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.517
- This is
Detective Edwards.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.653
- What are you saying,
Detective Edwards?

06:59.687 --> 07:02.189
- We have footage of the haunted
maze and surrounding areas

07:02.222 --> 07:04.091
from three different cameras.

07:04.124 --> 07:08.762
- Two detectives
stare at the clown,

07:08.796 --> 07:12.132
frantically writing
everything down,

07:12.165 --> 07:15.603
wasting valuable time
pinning me to the crime,

07:15.636 --> 07:19.139
while the good people
frown all over town.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.175
- Aren't you the clever one?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.877
- Some may say.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.880
- As of right now, seven
teenagers are missing.

07:26.914 --> 07:31.184
One teen is in critical
condition at Panama Hospital.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.086
- Your point?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.722
- Guilty is written
all over this footage.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.558
Let's break this situation down.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.761
- Hey, wait, guys,
we need a picture!

08:13.794 --> 08:14.728
- Yeah, okay, okay.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.796
- Say Halloween!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.531
- Halloween!

08:18.599 --> 08:19.833
- So going on Facebook!

08:19.867 --> 08:20.834
- Hey, let me check mine!

08:20.868 --> 08:22.970
- Not on my phone!

08:36.583 --> 08:38.986
- Seriously, it's
such a good place.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.020
Don't embarrass me!

08:42.121 --> 08:42.923
Yeah, right.
- Hey, guys,

08:42.956 --> 08:44.157
it's a quarter to nine.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.659
We should hop in line
before the prices go up.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.160
- All right.
- Let's go.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.877
- Did
you see that clown?

09:03.911 --> 09:04.745
- Where?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.113
- Over there.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.961
That freakin' dang clown!

09:20.994 --> 09:21.829
- Where?

09:24.932 --> 09:25.733
- There he is again.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.835
Are you kidding me?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.102
- Creeper!

09:40.714 --> 09:41.348
- Antonio!

09:43.817 --> 09:46.386
- Don't embarrass me!

09:46.419 --> 09:47.254
- Alana.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.225
- Alana, Antonio's here,
in the freaking flesh!

09:52.259 --> 09:53.627
- What?

09:53.661 --> 09:54.662
- Freaking flesh!

09:54.695 --> 09:56.196
- Seriously, stop!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.302
- Damn, he's gone!

10:02.335 --> 10:03.136
- Who?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.271
- That freaking clown!

10:04.304 --> 10:05.405
- What?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.774
- Why does it matter?

10:06.807 --> 10:07.941
- I hate clowns!

10:27.728 --> 10:28.762
- Hey, Muscles,
what's your name?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.019
What's your name?

10:52.052 --> 10:52.886
- Scott.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.993
Hope you're not hurting
our townspeople.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.864
- I can't pop
your cherry ,

11:03.897 --> 11:07.234
but I can make
your banana cream.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.744
- Right here, Beth.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.716
- I don't even have my
phone in this place.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.350
- Mine, too.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.920
- Snips of snails

13:39.953 --> 13:41.889
and slithering out snakes,

13:41.922 --> 13:45.893
that's what the boys
are made of.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.831
How's your one-eye hanging?

13:53.066 --> 13:56.870
- You gonna show
me what you're made of?

14:24.497 --> 14:26.133
- What the hell, country boy?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.968
What are you doing?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.238
- Can I at least
get your number?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.928
- Did you
guys see that crazy clown?

14:54.962 --> 14:56.663
- No.
- No, where?

14:56.696 --> 14:57.597
- I'm serious.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.066
He was at the Tilt-A-Whirl,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.668
staring at everybody
like really weirdly.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.136
- He's after you.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.938
- Stop, you know how
clowns freak me out.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.206
It's not even funny.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.707
- Boo!

15:07.740 --> 15:08.641
- Jackass.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.077
- Hey, you guys want some food?

15:13.113 --> 15:13.981
- Barbecue potato chips!

15:14.014 --> 15:15.315
- Cake!
- Soda!

15:15.348 --> 15:17.084
- Don't forget the ketchup.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.218
- And what were
you bitching about?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.953
- What doesn't she bitch about?

15:19.987 --> 15:22.055
- No, you guys, I'm serious.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.723
I think this clown
is stalking us.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.425
He's everywhere I turn.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.660
- I didn't see a clown.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.662
- Dude, how could you miss him?

15:29.696 --> 15:30.797
He was staring at everybody

15:30.830 --> 15:33.300
on the rides with his ax
all up in the air and stuff.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.334
- I saw him.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.137
- He's creepy right?

15:37.170 --> 15:40.107
- Well, you see,
monsters aren't real.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.610
They're just here
for the festival.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.079
- You're so funny, aren't you?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.981
- Who cares about the
fucking clown anyway?

15:48.015 --> 15:50.083
- Well, I think all
clowns are scary.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.151
- Oh yeah.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.022
Alana, Antonio's
waving at you, again.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.256
Why don't we go over
there and say hi?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.357
Come on.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.725
- No way.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.160
- What was that about?

16:00.193 --> 16:01.561
- She's trying to set
me up with Antonio.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.495
- That jerk?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.097
- Hey, he's a hottie.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.298
Ooh, food.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.499
Thank you, Hunter.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.701
- You're welcome.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.605
- Have you talked
to Teddy lately?

16:12.639 --> 16:15.108
- No, but he was on
the Tilt-A-Whirl.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.045
- He's with
Taylor.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.079
- It's okay, you're way better

16:19.112 --> 16:20.313
than that little whore.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.282
- At least you have Antonio.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.716
- True.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.219
- Better not see us tonight,
that's all I'm saying.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.220
- We got your back.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.421
- I got your back.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.157
- It's gonna go down.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.492
- I got her back, too.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.028
- You know what, we should
just forget about this

16:35.062 --> 16:36.329
and go check out
the Haunted Maze.

gonna get a hoodie.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.601
I'm freezing.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.007
- You're sick.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.442
- Hey, he's your boyfriend.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.377
Nice choice.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.212
- I think it was a good choice.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.885
- According to the
surveillance cameras,

20:18.918 --> 20:20.920
the seven missing teens
arrived at the Haunted Maze

20:20.953 --> 20:23.423
at 8:26 p.m., October 31st.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.928
Do you recall this particular
group of teenagers?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.270
- I do not recall.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.274
- You do not recall?

20:41.308 --> 20:45.278
Well, let's take a
stroll down memory lane.

20:45.312 --> 20:49.482
Here they are again at 9:09
p.m, and at 10:26 p.m.,

20:50.950 --> 20:54.954
they're seen entering the
Haunted Maze barn alive.

21:00.793 --> 21:04.631
The details starting to
clear up for you now?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.833
- I've seen many children.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.303
They do not look familiar.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.439
- Clancy Keller,
are you telling me

21:12.472 --> 21:14.641
you do not recognize
this particular group

21:14.674 --> 21:17.544
of teenagers seen
on this footage?

21:17.577 --> 21:19.579
- Perhaps I did.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.614
Perhaps I did not.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.784
Should I say it again,
in case you forgot?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.854
You're both so sure
that I have offended

21:27.887 --> 21:32.792
when that tape only proves
the teenagers attended.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.926
- Really?

21:33.960 --> 21:37.364
Well, you better dig into
your mind pretty damn quick.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.367
Your sisters have baited
you out as the killer.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.470
- You need to cooperate with us.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.437
- You're
not leaving here

21:44.471 --> 21:46.005
until you recall what happened.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.874
- Oh I'm diggin'.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.713
- Is it true you were
the only survivor

21:53.746 --> 21:55.748
of schoolhouse killings?

21:56.949 --> 22:00.520
- Well, now that's very
impressive, Detective.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.855
I see you've done your homework.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.724
- True?

22:04.757 --> 22:07.427
- I am sitting here.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.497
- And your father was
in fact the killer?

22:13.533 --> 22:16.369
- Do you recall what happened?

22:16.403 --> 22:19.005
- Since you've done your
homework, Detective,

22:19.038 --> 22:22.409
you already know what I
shared with the police.

22:22.442 --> 22:26.446
I suggest you review
your information again

22:26.479 --> 22:28.080
if you're confused.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.820
- I find it
fascinating to find out

22:33.853 --> 22:36.389
that you spent a few
years here in Panama,

22:36.423 --> 22:38.057
and this is your
first time to return

22:38.090 --> 22:41.494
since the schoolhouse killings.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.797
- Halloween spirit,
so fair in the air,

22:44.831 --> 22:49.101
and little brat children
in the costumes they wear,

22:49.135 --> 22:53.506
so rude and quite spoiled and
my last nerve, they boiled.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.511
So today is the day
their flesh I will tear.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.514
- Hey, I dare
you to bob for apples.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.083
- That's easy.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.128
- Is this what
your father said--

23:16.162 --> 23:18.931
- It's what I imagined
was in his mind.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.701
- Clancy Keller, this
shit is getting deep.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.905
Let me assist you with
your digging process, okay.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.477
Now this portion of this
tape that we're about

23:30.510 --> 23:32.812
to view is the
seven missing teens

23:32.845 --> 23:36.215
entering the haunted
barn, correct?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.584
- Perhaps it is.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.820
Perhaps it is not.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.624
- Well, let's take a look.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.482
- Come on!

24:09.516 --> 24:11.751
- He's gonna kill us.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.188
- That was really scary.
- It's okay.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.706
- Is it cool?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.016
- Oh whoa!

25:23.623 --> 25:24.691
- Whoa!
- What'd I say?

25:24.724 --> 25:25.792
What'd I say?

28:01.914 --> 28:04.817
- Welcome to the Haunted Maze.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.787
Please step to the
center of the room.

28:13.359 --> 28:17.730
- Tearing the flesh away
from her bones excited me

28:17.764 --> 28:19.398
unlike ever before.

28:19.431 --> 28:24.036
Blood coursed through my
veins with a killing desire.

28:24.070 --> 28:27.039
My once loved Greta
lay in pieces,

28:27.073 --> 28:30.409
strewn across the
floor, dead as dreams.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.779
A new nightmare began.

28:32.812 --> 28:37.049
Even now, I rot and lie
stinking in the earth,

28:37.083 --> 28:41.120
my soul confined to the
walls within this house.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.023
And you have come to
taunt and torment me

28:44.056 --> 28:47.760
with your lives.

28:50.029 --> 28:54.200
And I still desire young,
warm flesh.

28:58.437 --> 29:02.374
Go, behind you, enter.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.990
- Okay.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.926
- Um, that
is not my forte.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.099
- Oh my God!

30:05.137 --> 30:08.140
- Oh my
God, where's Jordan?

30:58.557 --> 31:00.359
- This is insane.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.061
Get moving, chicken.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.400
Get off of me!

31:17.676 --> 31:19.178
Oh my God!

31:19.211 --> 31:22.014
- God, it's a vampire!

31:23.149 --> 31:24.583
Told you this was
fucked up, honey.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.385
- Oh my God!

31:26.418 --> 31:28.054
- Keep going.

31:33.059 --> 31:36.095
- I don't want to
be here anymore.

31:42.969 --> 31:46.072
Oh my God!

32:26.112 --> 32:27.546
- Go, go!

32:32.551 --> 32:34.153
Go, go!

32:34.186 --> 32:37.223
- Uh-uh,
uh-uh, not happening!

33:05.584 --> 33:08.120
- How do we get out of here?

33:09.155 --> 33:09.988
Oh.

33:22.201 --> 33:22.801
- Over here.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.199
- Oh my God, do you see it?

34:52.690 --> 34:53.759
- Go!

35:02.301 --> 35:03.769
- Oh no!

35:03.802 --> 35:06.205
- Dead, he's dead.

35:06.238 --> 35:06.838
- There's a wall.

35:06.872 --> 35:07.806
Okay, stop.

35:20.886 --> 35:24.256
- Oh my God, you're
so slow!

35:24.290 --> 35:25.324
- Oh God.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.293
- Ew, what is that?

35:27.326 --> 35:29.861
- Ew, ew, ew!

35:29.895 --> 35:32.531
- It
just grabbed my leg.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.775
- I am Clancy the Killer Clown,

35:43.809 --> 35:47.246
and I sever heads
from town to town.

35:47.279 --> 35:51.283
Oh look, what a sin,
there's one in my bin,

35:51.317 --> 35:55.287
laying ever so quietly
next to its kin.

35:59.925 --> 36:00.726
Get out!

36:23.249 --> 36:23.882
- Oh God!

36:35.427 --> 36:37.829
- Oh God, oh God!

36:37.863 --> 36:38.830
- It's okay.

36:38.864 --> 36:39.865
- Oh my God!

37:00.051 --> 37:02.954
- Babe, are you okay?

37:02.988 --> 37:04.390
- Oh God, oh God.

37:51.803 --> 37:54.306
- So guys,
this is it, right?

37:54.340 --> 37:55.874
- Oh God.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.645
- Whoa, it's dark, man.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.550
- Where's the door?

38:04.583 --> 38:06.318
- Hey, this really uncool.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.320
- What the hell?

38:08.354 --> 38:09.388
Oh my God.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.092
I just noticed the
door won't open.

38:17.863 --> 38:18.964
- Jordan!

38:18.997 --> 38:19.798
- Where you at, girl?

38:19.831 --> 38:20.932
Where you at?

38:25.070 --> 38:27.105
There has to be a door
in here somewhere.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.440
Over here!

38:28.474 --> 38:29.375
It's right there.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.710
There's a handle on this one.

38:34.513 --> 38:35.581
- Okay, let's wait.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.583
- Guys.
- It's locked!

38:37.616 --> 38:38.517
- Honestly!

38:38.550 --> 38:39.385
- The door was open.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.519
- Not funny!

38:40.552 --> 38:41.487
- We're deep in this!

38:41.520 --> 38:42.821
- We're gonna die.

38:42.854 --> 38:43.922
- You guys, let us out!

38:43.955 --> 38:46.091
- We're gonna die.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.463
- Do you hear somethin'?

39:26.031 --> 39:28.867
- So you don't recognize
this group of teenagers,

39:28.900 --> 39:30.869
but you're on camera
following them around

39:30.902 --> 39:33.439
like your next meal, not
to mention grabbing the arm

39:33.472 --> 39:34.740
of the missing female.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.042
What do you have to
say for yourself?

39:37.075 --> 39:40.446
- A haunted facility is
an establishment designed

39:40.479 --> 39:41.880
to frighten the public.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.550
Perhaps I did see them.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.785
Perhaps I do not recall.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.587
- That's not what
you said last time.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.456
- Well, we have
proof, right here.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.725
There are laws and regulations
governing haunted facilities.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.761
- You are aware of
the laws and rules

39:55.794 --> 39:57.563
to run a haunted facility?

39:57.596 --> 39:59.965
There is no touching at all.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.633
You're aware of that, correct?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.536
- Get off of me!

40:04.570 --> 40:06.538
- I know what I know.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.474
And I share what I share.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.743
- Just answer the
fuckin' question.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.546
- I see someone
has anger issues.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.550
I live by the family rule.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.152
Each year when the
hallowed spirit is new,

40:21.186 --> 40:24.189
each year to thine
own self be true.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.493
- Family rule?

40:27.526 --> 40:28.827
- Can you explain?

40:30.762 --> 40:34.933
- We were a traveling circus
and really quite styled,

40:36.067 --> 40:39.505
till my mother died
giving birth to a child.

40:39.538 --> 40:44.142
The show became raw and
was shut down by the law

40:44.175 --> 40:47.746
for questionable reasons
still yet unfiled.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.883
So we moved to a town,
and we tried to fit in,

40:51.917 --> 40:54.820
until my father
committed that sin.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.691
So the sibling gathered
in a room for din

40:59.725 --> 41:03.629
and decided our family
would travel again.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.664
- Getting more interesting.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.767
- So after the
schoolhouse killings,

41:08.800 --> 41:11.670
your family went
back out on the road?

41:11.703 --> 41:15.240
- Don't believe everything
you hear, Detective,

41:15.273 --> 41:18.544
and only half of what you see.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.578
- Moving on.

41:20.512 --> 41:24.683
The seven teens are
shown climbing a ladder.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.185
Where does that
ladder lead, any idea?

41:27.218 --> 41:28.319
- I do not recall.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.591
- You have no idea where this
ladder might lead visitors

41:32.624 --> 41:33.592
to the Haunted Maze?

41:33.625 --> 41:34.560
- Nope.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.694
- We went back to the barn.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.729
The ladder's
nowhere to be found.

41:37.763 --> 41:38.964
So it just vanished?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.566
- Perhaps it did.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.634
Perhaps it did not.

41:42.668 --> 41:43.869
- Can you share with us

41:43.902 --> 41:44.870
where the teens may
have been located

41:44.903 --> 41:46.738
in the barn, overnight?

41:46.772 --> 41:47.706
- The barn?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.309
- Your traveling entourage,

41:51.342 --> 41:53.579
park an RV on the property

41:53.612 --> 41:55.681
where you're gonna set
the festival, correct?

41:55.714 --> 41:58.850
- I believe that is the
case in most of our setups.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.952
- Who resided in the RV?

42:00.986 --> 42:03.154
- The traveling entourage.

42:04.990 --> 42:08.560
- Who was there the
evening of October 31st?

42:08.594 --> 42:10.095
- I do not recall.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.832
- Let me share this with you.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.967
Next time the teens are seen,

42:16.001 --> 42:20.305
they're running into
the barn at 5:14 a.m.

42:20.338 --> 42:24.710
A.M., so they were there
overnight and are still alive.

42:27.779 --> 42:28.980
The teens' minivan never left

42:29.014 --> 42:31.750
the Halloween festival property.

42:31.783 --> 42:36.121
As you see, we have you on
camera chasing the seven teens.

42:41.793 --> 42:44.663
- Is this funny to you, Clancy?

42:44.696 --> 42:46.197
- Pesky teenagers.

42:47.966 --> 42:49.801
What you think is fact

42:51.069 --> 42:52.638
is, in fact, false.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.850
- Let us out!

43:04.883 --> 43:06.685
- My God, is this a snake?

43:06.718 --> 43:07.986
Okay.

43:08.019 --> 43:09.655
- That was metal.

43:10.656 --> 43:11.256
I don't know.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.191
Wait, something, anyone?

43:13.224 --> 43:16.127
Like a little juice,
jack-in-the-box.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.663
I'm not scared.

43:21.900 --> 43:22.834
Go in the wrong door?

43:22.868 --> 43:24.903
- Try to--
- I don't know.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.204
- Let's just wait.

43:26.237 --> 43:27.773
- Let's play What If.

43:27.806 --> 43:28.874
- I'm game.

43:28.907 --> 43:30.742
- Well, Maci picks first.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.410
- Why does she always
get to go first?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.812
- Dude, you know the rules.

43:33.845 --> 43:35.814
She said she's game first.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.417
- Okay, eight.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.952
- Seven.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.087
- One.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.221
- Two.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.656
- Nine.

43:44.690 --> 43:45.423
- 10.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.025
Well, Maci wins it with eight.

43:47.058 --> 43:48.827
- Oh dude, she wins!

43:48.860 --> 43:50.829
- Okay, I've got one.

43:50.862 --> 43:53.799
What if we're all stranded
in this haunted house

43:53.832 --> 43:57.402
with psychos, and you
have this one chance

43:57.435 --> 44:00.271
to say goodbye to
all your friends,

44:00.305 --> 44:02.140
what would you say?

44:02.173 --> 44:04.209
- I love you all.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.777
Don't forget me.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.284
- I would just tell everyone
come fuckin' find me!

44:13.318 --> 44:15.821
- You guys, I'm serious.

44:15.854 --> 44:18.924
I have this really horrible
feeling in the pit of my stomach

44:18.957 --> 44:21.693
that something bad
is gonna happen.

44:21.727 --> 44:23.461
I know we're just
here until tomorrow,

44:23.494 --> 44:26.765
but this feeling
is gut-wrenching.

44:26.798 --> 44:27.699
I mean, this is freaky.

44:27.733 --> 44:29.968
None of our phones are working.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.871
It's like the power has
been jammed or something.

44:32.904 --> 44:36.875
I mean, is anybody's phone
working at all, anyone's?

44:38.276 --> 44:40.011
- No, I have nothing.

44:41.446 --> 44:43.749
- Mine shut off.

44:46.284 --> 44:49.087
- Can anyone hear
us, anyone out there?

44:49.120 --> 44:51.089
- Come on, this
isn't fucking right.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.291
- We're in here!
- It's wrong!

44:57.796 --> 44:59.230
- Let us
go here, come on!

45:03.234 --> 45:05.303
- You got my money.

45:05.336 --> 45:07.472
- Come
on, it's not cool.

45:07.505 --> 45:08.907
- Hello?

45:10.008 --> 45:10.842
Hello!

45:25.791 --> 45:27.725
- Let us go!

45:31.863 --> 45:32.463
- Well, hello.

45:32.497 --> 45:33.298
- Hello.

45:33.331 --> 45:34.766
I'm Agent Hawk.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.334
- What brings you out here?

45:36.367 --> 45:37.969
- Oh I've been following
Clancy the Clown

45:38.003 --> 45:39.905
and his entourage
since Chicago, Illinois

45:39.938 --> 45:41.372
on a narcotics tip.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.241
- Yeah, well, those carnies
are pretty weird people.

45:43.274 --> 45:44.209
- Indeed.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.043
So I was just curious.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.311
What's your status here?

45:46.344 --> 45:47.378
- Well, let me tell
you what's going on.

47:20.505 --> 47:24.275
- So Clancy has more
kids locked in the barn.

47:26.011 --> 47:27.412
- Again?

47:27.445 --> 47:28.246
- Again.

47:46.932 --> 47:47.899
- Yeah?

47:47.933 --> 47:50.635
- Hi, I'm Officer O'Doyle,
and this here is--

47:50.668 --> 47:51.970
- Agent Hawk.

47:52.971 --> 47:54.005
- What do you want?

47:54.039 --> 47:55.907
- We just need to ask you
a couple of questions.

47:55.941 --> 47:56.541
- What?

47:56.574 --> 47:57.943
- Who is that?

47:57.976 --> 47:59.144
- It's the po-pos.

47:59.177 --> 48:01.913
They have some
questions for you.

48:01.947 --> 48:03.114
- Is this your property?

48:03.148 --> 48:05.583
- Nah, we just
hold up shop here.

48:05.616 --> 48:07.652
- For the traveling carnival.

48:07.685 --> 48:10.121
- I noticed a minivan
in the parking lot.

48:10.155 --> 48:11.556
It belongs to a
couple of teenagers

48:11.589 --> 48:12.958
who have been missing
all night long,

48:12.991 --> 48:14.025
and their parents
wanted us to come out

48:14.059 --> 48:16.928
and check around for them.

48:16.962 --> 48:19.197
- Well, what's that
got to do with us?

48:19.230 --> 48:21.099
- Yeah, who are you here to see?

48:21.132 --> 48:23.634
- Agent Hawk, want to come in?

48:25.003 --> 48:27.005
- Have any of you
ladies seen a group

48:27.038 --> 48:29.407
of teenagers, around closing?

48:29.440 --> 48:31.542
- Not at closing.

48:31.576 --> 48:32.978
Well, if you don't mind,

48:33.011 --> 48:35.246
we'd like to take look
around the grounds.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.948
- It'll cost you.

48:36.982 --> 48:39.050
- Ca-ching!

48:39.084 --> 48:42.453
- I handle the money
in this entourage.

48:42.487 --> 48:43.521
- No, you don't.

48:43.554 --> 48:44.655
- Yeah, I does.

48:44.689 --> 48:45.556
- No, you don't.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.092
- Yeah, I does!

48:47.125 --> 48:48.593
- No, you don't!
- Yeah!

48:48.626 --> 48:50.595
- We're just gonna take
a look around then, okay?

48:50.628 --> 48:52.230
- Blah, blah, blah.

48:59.637 --> 49:01.272
- You should go now.

49:11.049 --> 49:13.418
- I had Officer Trent check
the carnival rides already,

49:13.451 --> 49:15.120
so I'll go ahead, and
I'll check the back barn.

49:15.153 --> 49:16.054
- I'll check the front one.

49:16.087 --> 49:17.222
- Alrighty, let's go.

50:25.423 --> 50:26.257
- Hello?

50:38.336 --> 50:39.170
Hello?

50:40.571 --> 50:42.006
Is anybody there?

52:17.368 --> 52:18.269
Look what I found?

52:18.303 --> 52:19.304
- Cute.

52:19.337 --> 52:20.238
- Yeah.

52:20.271 --> 52:21.239
Did you find anything?

52:21.272 --> 52:22.573
- Nah.

52:22.607 --> 52:24.275
- I haven't seen
anything either.

52:24.309 --> 52:26.211
- Let's go check behind
the barn, you know,

52:26.244 --> 52:27.345
the parking lot,

52:27.378 --> 52:29.347
all good.
- Got it, got it.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.836
- Hey,
someone out there!

52:54.272 --> 52:56.274
Guys, let us out!

52:56.307 --> 52:57.308
We're stuck in here!

52:57.342 --> 52:59.377
- We've got hard.
- Let us out!

52:59.410 --> 53:00.545
- I'm just
holding, come on!

53:00.578 --> 53:01.746
- You locked us in!

53:12.890 --> 53:14.825
- Officer Trent here.

53:14.859 --> 53:15.960
The Landers' minivan was there,

53:15.993 --> 53:18.863
but we took around the festival
property and the barns.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.531
We didn't see 'em.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.500
- We also spoke with a couple
of the carnival workers,

53:22.533 --> 53:26.471
and they hadn't seen anyone
at closing time, either.

53:26.504 --> 53:27.305
- Orders
from the chief are

53:27.338 --> 53:29.307
for you to stay put.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.009
The Landers are on their way.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.344
- We just left there.

53:33.378 --> 53:34.745
We searched the entire property.

53:34.779 --> 53:36.714
No one's there.

53:36.747 --> 53:38.616
I'm bettin' the kids took
off with another friend,

53:38.649 --> 53:41.252
and they're havin'
themselves a good time.

53:41.286 --> 53:42.420
You know what I mean?

53:42.453 --> 53:46.424
- Oh, but I need
you to get back out there.

53:46.457 --> 53:49.327
Report in when back-up arrives.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.395
- Back-up?

53:51.796 --> 53:53.331
- We hear you, partner.

53:53.364 --> 53:56.367
- Not another word,
we're on our way.

53:59.537 --> 54:01.639
- Hey!
- We're ready to go now.

54:01.672 --> 54:04.275
- Open the door!

54:04.309 --> 54:06.544
- Please, somebody.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.319
- Well, I got orders
from Chief Harrison.

54:14.352 --> 54:16.321
They're for us to stay here
at the festival grounds

54:16.354 --> 54:17.588
and for you--

54:17.622 --> 54:18.789
- I'm supposed to
be home right now.

54:18.823 --> 54:20.391
The sun is comin' up.

54:20.425 --> 54:22.593
- And for you, Officer Trent,

54:22.627 --> 54:24.529
you're to take my
car, go into town

54:24.562 --> 54:26.631
and check out a call
that came in earlier

54:26.664 --> 54:29.700
about a girl who was wandering
in a field near Main Street.

54:29.734 --> 54:31.936
The chief said that the Landers
family will be here soon,

54:31.969 --> 54:32.970
so hurry back.

54:33.003 --> 54:33.804
- You got it.

54:41.045 --> 54:42.513
- Looks like you're pullin'
double duty there, O'Doyle.

54:42.547 --> 54:43.381
- Thanks.

54:58.463 --> 54:59.497
- Turn on the car
and warm it up a bit.

54:59.530 --> 55:00.565
- Sure thing.
- It's cold.

55:00.598 --> 55:01.399
- It's freezing in here.

55:04.469 --> 55:05.803
Oh shit!

55:05.836 --> 55:06.737
What the hell?

55:06.771 --> 55:08.439
- That was priceless.

55:08.473 --> 55:09.073
- Nice.

55:09.106 --> 55:09.907
- Oh.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.376
- Damn clown.

55:41.472 --> 55:42.440
- What was that?

55:42.473 --> 55:45.042
- Yeah, what was that?

55:49.514 --> 55:50.448
- Shit, my heels!

56:04.462 --> 56:08.633
- Your fingerprints were found
on this young female's body.

56:10.501 --> 56:13.538
Unless you can explain
or unless you know

56:13.571 --> 56:16.541
who's behind these
killings, if it was one

56:16.574 --> 56:18.843
of your younger sisters
or another worker,

56:18.876 --> 56:20.478
we can work out a deal for you.

56:20.511 --> 56:23.848
- Or prison is calling
your name for life.

56:23.881 --> 56:26.584
- That tape only
proves the teens were

56:26.617 --> 56:30.588
at the haunted facility,
camping out for some alone time.

56:33.824 --> 56:37.662
And the fingerprints you
have, ever so divine,

56:39.530 --> 56:42.433
you are well aware
are not of mine.

56:45.603 --> 56:49.574
Thanks for playing.

56:51.676 --> 56:53.077
- Detective Cole?

56:54.244 --> 56:56.046
Can I have a word with you?

56:56.080 --> 56:57.014
- Yes, sir.

57:06.791 --> 57:09.527
- You ever been to prison?

57:09.560 --> 57:12.863
If you take a shower,
don't drop the soap.

57:13.864 --> 57:16.467
They will butt-fuck you.

57:16.501 --> 57:19.537
You sure you want
to go there, hmm?

57:19.570 --> 57:21.939
Oh boy, they'll have
a lot of fun with you.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.674
They like make-up.

57:24.609 --> 57:26.076
- Sounds intriguing.

57:27.845 --> 57:29.514
- Oh it is, yeah.

57:29.547 --> 57:31.482
Okay, without a doubt,

57:31.516 --> 57:33.150
without a doubt.

57:33.183 --> 57:35.486
Oh they'd love you,

57:35.520 --> 57:37.655
that long, pretty hair.

57:38.656 --> 57:40.925
Yeah, I'd like to be there.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.494
Unfortunately, I got a date.

58:59.937 --> 59:01.606
- What the hell's
going in there?

59:01.639 --> 59:02.773
- Well, before his lawyer
arrives, we need to get

59:02.807 --> 59:06.677
to the bottom of where the
teens might be or a confession.

59:06.711 --> 59:08.145
- Oh, I get that,

59:08.178 --> 59:10.748
but you do realize that
you just threw down

59:10.781 --> 59:13.584
on the table information
he already has.

59:13.618 --> 59:15.252
We just confirmed that
we don't know anything

59:15.285 --> 59:16.721
about those teenagers.

59:16.754 --> 59:17.822
- Sir, I know I took
a stab in the dark.

59:17.855 --> 59:20.758
However, I might be spot
on with this information.

59:20.791 --> 59:23.728
- Might be spot
on doesn't cut it.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.963
The sociopathic mind,
the way it works,

59:25.996 --> 59:30.000
the girl in the picture
you showed him is alive.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.736
Clancy knows this.

59:33.771 --> 59:36.607
- We gave him too
much information.

59:36.641 --> 59:39.910
I know I, I saw his
facial expression

59:39.944 --> 59:41.278
the second we threw
the picture down

59:41.311 --> 59:44.715
on the table saying his
fingerprints were on it.

59:44.749 --> 59:46.150
Dammit.

59:46.183 --> 59:50.154
- You notice how he became
pleasantly agitated?

59:50.187 --> 59:51.889
- I was evaluating
his body movements,

59:51.922 --> 59:56.193
and I did notice he became
agitated by this comment.

59:56.226 --> 59:59.830
He was almost
pleasantly agitated.

59:59.864 --> 01:00:02.733
- He knows what happened to whom

01:00:03.668 --> 01:00:06.103
and where those teenagers are.

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:08.773
Now we need to get
that information

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:11.241
and whoever the hell
hired this clown

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.643
and his traveling carnival.

01:00:12.677 --> 01:00:13.711
- I already have
someone on it, sir.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:14.945
- No, wait, wait.

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:20.718
I need you to choose
your words wisely.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:25.823
We don't have much time to get
this information out of him.

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:28.759
This family comes
from old money.

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.861
I'm sure their lawyers
are on the way here now.

01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:33.664
I remember this clown's father.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.768
The Kellers came to town,

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.772
acting like they owned it.

01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:44.942
It wasn't but three
months or more later

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:50.080
that Mr. Keller slaughtered
all those school kids,

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:52.116
including my older brother.

01:00:58.088 --> 01:00:59.890
- I'm so sorry, Chief.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:02.727
- I know it's in his blood
to do the same thing.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.763
I don't want this
man on the street.

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:09.734
- I'm on it, Chief.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.201
- Time, time.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:12.036
Yes, sir.
- Take care.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:13.003
Get in there, go.

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:13.971
- Yes, sir.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:21.846
So,

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:26.216
tell us, Clancy Keller,

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.786
are there any survivors?

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:30.921
- Are there any deaths?

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:34.859
- According to the
list of missing people,

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:37.061
eight, most likely dead.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:39.196
- Don't say another word.

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.133
I'm Clancy Keller's attorney.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:45.836
There's a colossal difference

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.373
between missing and
dead, detectives.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.175
Mr. Keller, let's go.

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:55.780
- What's the next town?

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:03.888
- Two detectives
looking quite pale,

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:05.890
interrogating to no avail.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.927
But that last
question you peddled,

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.229
when the ash is settled,

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.264
the truth shall prevail.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:33.283
Two detectives
assailed the clown,

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:36.887
frantically writing
everything down,

01:02:36.921 --> 01:02:38.322
wasting valuable time,

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:40.791
committing the crime,

01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:43.828
good people falling
all of the time.

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:48.298
- Clancy,
you better go home.

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:50.267
- Guys, this way.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:52.069
Finally.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:02.913
There, go!

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:08.318
- Oh my God!

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:17.962
- Go!

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:09.947
- Go, go, go!

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:44.548
- Go!

01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:47.584
No, no!

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:49.486
No!

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.089
No!

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:56.060
I just want you all to know,

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:59.029
I'd like to remember this face

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:01.665
before I leave this place,

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:04.134
for all the good, the bad,

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:06.003
the happy and the sad,

01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:12.042
it was fun partying with
you while it lasted,

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:14.578
which was way too little time.

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:16.680
I love you.

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:17.547
No, no!

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:21.718
No, no!

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.652
No, no, no!

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:38.702
- No, please, no,
please!

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:39.569
Stop!

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:42.172
Mom, Dad, Holly,

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.010
no matter how many
fights we get in,

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:48.412
no matter how many times
we're mad at each other,

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:49.379
I'll always love you.

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.416
I love you unquestionably.

01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:04.294
- Oh shit!

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:06.296
Get away from me!

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:16.673
Please.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:25.615
- Little boy blue.

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:53.009
Boo hoo.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:10.194
- I just want you all
to know that I love you.

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:12.629
And I'll never forget you.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.431
Please, don't be sad.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.136
It's my time to go, I guess.

01:07:20.304 --> 01:07:23.373
I know I've done some
good and also some bad,

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:27.111
but I'll treasure
all our memories.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:29.646
And please remember me.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:32.216
I'll see you soon
on the other side.

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:33.750
I truly love you all.

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:41.691
