00:00.845 --> 00:02.366
Previously on Lucifer...

00:02.368 --> 00:04.474
Tell me, what do you desire?

00:04.476 --> 00:05.959
This is it? This is your big trick?

00:05.961 --> 00:07.419
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

00:07.421 --> 00:09.095
I guess we both have our mysteries.

00:09.097 --> 00:11.597
35 years ago, Father
asked me to come down here

00:11.599 --> 00:13.533
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.

00:13.568 --> 00:15.802
You look really familiar. Have we met?

00:15.804 --> 00:18.237
Your Father put her in Lucifer's path.

00:18.239 --> 00:19.639
We're going home, son.

00:19.641 --> 00:22.342
And Chloe is the key.

00:22.344 --> 00:25.111
Andy Kleinberg? Jana Lawrence
was found murdered this morning.

00:25.113 --> 00:27.793
One of them broke. I
spilled a little on myself.

00:27.818 --> 00:29.782
What the hell is happening to me?

00:29.784 --> 00:32.452
So what if you slept
with Charlotte Richards?

00:32.454 --> 00:33.987
You slept with my...

00:33.989 --> 00:35.321
Whoa!

00:35.323 --> 00:37.348
He's different when he's with you.

00:37.373 --> 00:39.357
Chloe Decker is causing
your vulnerability.

00:39.382 --> 00:40.326
I'm bleeding.

00:40.328 --> 00:41.995
Do you think I'm boyfriend material?

00:41.997 --> 00:43.830
Perhaps you've been
underestimating yourself.

00:43.832 --> 00:45.965
You deserve someone as good as you.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:09.758 --> 01:11.324
Oh, Detective.

01:22.637 --> 01:26.606
Detective, are you sure
you want to do this?

01:26.608 --> 01:28.441
Shut up.

01:40.755 --> 01:42.622
I see you've found my love handles.

01:56.237 --> 01:57.270
How was it?

01:57.272 --> 01:58.905
What are you doing in here?

01:58.907 --> 02:01.674
What? I heard you
scream, so I ran in to see

02:01.676 --> 02:03.576
if you were in danger.
Then I figured out

02:03.578 --> 02:05.978
what was really going on, you know,

02:05.980 --> 02:07.280
so I stayed to watch the show.

02:07.282 --> 02:08.448
Hey.

02:08.449 --> 02:10.616
What was that... That
thing you were doing?

02:10.618 --> 02:11.617
You were like...

02:11.619 --> 02:12.919
Okay, Maze,

02:12.921 --> 02:14.387
get out.

02:14.389 --> 02:15.700
Now.

02:15.725 --> 02:18.157
All right, at least you're
getting laid in your dreams.

02:18.159 --> 02:20.259
'Cause it's not happening in real life.

02:20.261 --> 02:21.861
You don't know that.

02:23.202 --> 02:25.698
I just wish you'd loosen up, Decker.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.400
You know, throw caution to the wind,

02:27.402 --> 02:28.935
be impulsive,

02:28.937 --> 02:30.803
just once.

02:30.805 --> 02:32.672
Instead of, you know,

02:32.674 --> 02:34.373
being you.

02:42.984 --> 02:45.852
Maybe this time will be different.

02:45.854 --> 02:49.589
This time will definitely
be different, Doctor.

02:49.591 --> 02:52.325
I've decided to take
things slow, for once.

02:52.327 --> 02:55.194
Hmm, and why is that?

02:55.196 --> 02:58.064
Because I'm a responsible Devil.

02:58.066 --> 03:02.768
And I... well, I know what
a big deal the kiss was...

03:02.770 --> 03:03.903
for the detective.

03:03.905 --> 03:05.271
For her?

03:05.273 --> 03:06.439
Well, I'm sure it must have made

03:06.441 --> 03:07.473
quite an impact on her.

03:07.475 --> 03:10.076
I mean, it, it is me.

03:10.078 --> 03:11.210
No doubt she's overwhelmed

03:11.212 --> 03:12.912
by emotions she's never felt before.

03:12.914 --> 03:14.147
She's overwhelmed?

03:14.149 --> 03:15.381
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.

03:15.383 --> 03:16.682
Is that why you went your separate ways

03:16.684 --> 03:17.717
after the kiss?

03:17.719 --> 03:19.452
Precisely.

03:19.454 --> 03:21.487
Yes, although she did have
that wretched dependent

03:21.489 --> 03:22.688
waiting for her at home.

03:22.690 --> 03:25.024
Well, two, if you count the child.

03:25.026 --> 03:27.326
I think I know what's happening.

03:27.328 --> 03:28.995
Y-You do?

03:28.997 --> 03:30.663
You're stalling, Lucifer.

03:30.665 --> 03:32.231
Stalling?

03:32.233 --> 03:34.934
Sex? Me?

03:34.936 --> 03:36.369
Doctor, have we even met before?

03:36.371 --> 03:38.304
You're stalling because you've realized

03:38.306 --> 03:40.640
how complicated your relationship is.

03:40.642 --> 03:42.208
Look...

03:42.210 --> 03:45.077
the, um, the truth is that...

03:45.079 --> 03:46.646
I still don't understand why,

03:46.648 --> 03:51.417
after everything I said about
my less positive qualities,

03:51.419 --> 03:53.586
she still chose to kiss me.

03:53.588 --> 03:55.288
I mean, do you think she's ill?

03:55.290 --> 03:57.323
Or maybe...

03:57.325 --> 03:59.130
she's just taken by you?

03:59.155 --> 04:00.893
Well, that's impossible.

04:00.895 --> 04:03.596
The detective is completely
immune to my charms.

04:05.934 --> 04:09.202
Or she was immune.

04:09.204 --> 04:10.937
Maybe that's what's changed.

04:11.858 --> 04:13.873
Of course, I mean why
else would she kiss me?

04:13.875 --> 04:15.544
But there's also the possibility...

04:15.569 --> 04:16.209
No, no, no.

04:16.211 --> 04:18.077
No. That's very good.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.379
Thank you, Doctor.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.547
I know what to do now.

04:26.955 --> 04:28.955
Morning.

04:28.957 --> 04:31.090
Hey.

04:31.092 --> 04:32.959
So, how was the rest of your night?

04:32.961 --> 04:34.994
It was fine, thank you.

04:34.996 --> 04:36.722
How was the rest of your night?

04:36.747 --> 04:39.365
Uh, fine, thank you.

04:39.367 --> 04:40.933
Excellent. So we're all fine, then.

04:40.935 --> 04:42.001
But before we deal with

04:42.003 --> 04:43.336
whatever atrocity awaits,

04:43.338 --> 04:44.537
there's something important

04:44.539 --> 04:46.405
I need to ask you, Detective. It's...

04:46.407 --> 04:47.873
well, it's about us.

04:47.875 --> 04:50.009
Okay.

04:53.201 --> 04:55.502
So what is it you truly desire now?

04:58.419 --> 04:59.885
Lucifer, what the hell are you doing?

04:59.887 --> 05:01.287
You know that stuff doesn't work on me.

05:01.289 --> 05:02.888
Right.

05:02.890 --> 05:05.224
Yes, no, of course. I was, uh, joking.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.279
Right.

05:13.635 --> 05:15.101
I was just trying to...

05:15.103 --> 05:18.337
Maze said this morning, you know,

05:18.339 --> 05:21.240
throw caution to
the... Never mind, it...

05:21.242 --> 05:24.343
That was weird. Yeah. We... let's go.

05:24.345 --> 05:25.911
Right.

05:29.951 --> 05:31.984
Right, what have we got?

05:31.986 --> 05:35.421
Meet Rick Cormier.

05:35.423 --> 05:39.392
19-years-old. Malibu State freshman.

05:39.394 --> 05:41.946
Friends thought he was just
hungover after the big win

05:41.971 --> 05:43.696
against the Pasadena Gray Hawks.

05:43.698 --> 05:45.331
Turns out, he be dead.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.499
Of poisoning.

05:46.501 --> 05:48.167
- Ooh.
- Like alcohol poisoning?

05:48.169 --> 05:51.070
No, like poison poisoning.

05:51.072 --> 05:52.171
Check it out:

05:52.173 --> 05:54.340
petechial hemorrhaging,

05:54.342 --> 05:56.976
ribboned skin,

05:56.978 --> 05:58.757
ocular discharge.

05:58.782 --> 06:00.579
Sorry, she said "discharge,"

06:00.581 --> 06:01.614
it gets me every time.

06:04.686 --> 06:06.352
Any idea

06:06.354 --> 06:08.108
of how long it took
the poison to activate?

06:08.133 --> 06:10.556
Well, it's hard to say
for sure, but best guess,

06:10.558 --> 06:11.824
maybe 24 hours?

06:11.826 --> 06:13.793
I hope poor Ricky made 'em count.

06:13.795 --> 06:16.962
Enjoying what little life he
had left with sex or friends.

06:16.964 --> 06:19.732
Or sex with friends.

06:22.236 --> 06:24.316
I just figured that's where
you were going with that.

06:24.341 --> 06:26.205
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know

06:26.207 --> 06:27.740
how down he was to party,

06:27.742 --> 06:30.009
but, you guys,

06:30.011 --> 06:32.712
I've seen a lot of messed up stuff.

06:32.714 --> 06:35.134
This toxin tore through his body

06:35.159 --> 06:37.183
like it was burning
him from the inside out.

06:37.185 --> 06:38.784
I mean, I'm gonna have to reach out

06:38.786 --> 06:41.220
to my forensic contacts just
to see if anyone knows anything.

06:41.222 --> 06:42.922
Who found the body?

06:42.924 --> 06:45.991
I thought he was just
sleeping it off for once.

06:46.016 --> 06:47.993
I didn't realize he was freakin' dead.

06:47.995 --> 06:50.262
Do you know anyone who may
have had a problem with him?

06:50.264 --> 06:51.297
No way.

06:51.299 --> 06:52.698
We all loved Ricky.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.734
Did you notice anything
strange in the last few days?

06:54.736 --> 06:56.202
Any unusual behavior?

06:56.227 --> 06:57.071
Like what?

06:57.073 --> 06:59.271
Like someone carrying a
small apothecary bottle

06:59.273 --> 07:01.173
marked with a skull
and crossbones perhaps?

07:01.175 --> 07:03.008
No, nothing like that.

07:03.010 --> 07:05.311
But Johnny Kane came
by the dorm yesterday.

07:05.313 --> 07:07.480
- Mm.
- What, Johnny Kane Johnny Kane?

07:07.482 --> 07:08.848
As in the actor Johnny Kane?

07:08.850 --> 07:10.683
Yeah. My mom went pretty nuts

07:10.685 --> 07:12.318
when I told her.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.819
He even signed one of my DVDs.

07:13.821 --> 07:15.154
- No.
- Huh.

07:15.156 --> 07:18.023
Oh. To Love Is to Die.

07:18.025 --> 07:19.525
Impressive work.

07:19.527 --> 07:21.394
I mean, to be a man playing
a woman playing a man.

07:21.396 --> 07:23.028
It's absolutely dizzying.

07:24.098 --> 07:25.631
What, should I have said "spoiler"?

07:25.633 --> 07:27.333
Apparently he was here

07:27.335 --> 07:28.601
researching a role.

07:28.603 --> 07:30.102
Hmm, committed.

07:30.104 --> 07:31.437
He's, like, 40 years old, there's no way

07:31.439 --> 07:33.339
he could pull off
playing a college student.

07:33.341 --> 07:35.408
Um, surely you misspoke, Detective.

07:35.410 --> 07:36.609
I mean, Johnny Kane's a spry

07:36.611 --> 07:38.511
and handsome young
man, wouldn't you say?

07:38.513 --> 07:40.179
No, he's quite old. And
since when did you become

07:40.181 --> 07:41.380
the president of his fan club?

07:41.382 --> 07:44.424
Since he just walked in
here wielding a large knife.

07:44.449 --> 07:46.950
Am I too late? Is he dead?

07:47.655 --> 07:50.022
- Is he dead?
- Freeze. Drop the knife.

07:50.024 --> 07:51.824
It's my fault. He's dead because of me.

07:51.826 --> 07:52.892
Put down the knife, Johnny.

07:52.894 --> 07:53.893
Yes, listen to her, Johnny.

07:53.895 --> 07:54.894
She's quite a good shot.

07:54.896 --> 07:56.429
You don't understand!

07:56.431 --> 07:57.863
I couldn't do what the man said.

07:57.865 --> 07:58.864
What man?

07:58.866 --> 08:02.168
The man said he would kill that kid

08:02.170 --> 08:04.069
if I didn't cut my face.

08:15.449 --> 08:18.636
Mr. Johnny Kane, you're an amazing actor

08:18.661 --> 08:22.286
with an impressive library
of films under your belt.

08:22.288 --> 08:24.900
Beloved by critics and the public alike.

08:24.925 --> 08:26.190
Many would say

08:26.192 --> 08:29.237
you're at the top of
your profession right now.

08:29.262 --> 08:31.195
Which is why it'll be so interesting

08:31.197 --> 08:34.532
to see what decision you
make for this experiment.

08:34.534 --> 08:35.900
You can either...

08:35.902 --> 08:40.871
carve up your own face, or...

08:40.874 --> 08:44.375
Rick Cormier, an innocent
freshman at Malibu State,

08:44.377 --> 08:46.544
will die of poisoning.

08:46.546 --> 08:49.013
You have 24 hours to decide.

08:49.015 --> 08:51.916
Do what's asked and an
antidote will be delivered.

08:51.918 --> 08:55.319
The choice is yours alone.

08:55.321 --> 08:56.721
Well, that's dramatic.

08:57.363 --> 08:58.695
When did you get this video?

08:58.720 --> 09:00.391
Yesterday. At first,

09:00.393 --> 09:02.927
I thought it was some sick joke.

09:02.929 --> 09:06.030
Fans send bizarre letters
to my manager all the time,

09:06.032 --> 09:08.466
but this was sent directly
to my personal e-mail,

09:08.468 --> 09:10.668
and it was so...

09:10.670 --> 09:11.936
disturbing.

09:11.938 --> 09:13.271
I couldn't get it out of my head.

09:13.273 --> 09:15.306
- I had to check it out.
- So you went to the school.

09:15.308 --> 09:16.374
Yeah, when I realized

09:16.376 --> 09:18.409
that this kid was a
real student at Malibu,

09:18.411 --> 09:20.211
I... I started thinking

09:20.213 --> 09:22.580
that this "experiment"
might be real, too.

09:22.582 --> 09:25.716
I went home and I stared
at that knife for hours.

09:25.718 --> 09:28.352
But I couldn't do it.

09:28.354 --> 09:30.338
I couldn't cut up my face.

09:30.363 --> 09:32.090
Well, of course you couldn't.

09:32.115 --> 09:33.692
That's an impossible choice.

09:33.694 --> 09:35.661
This killer is clearly playing God.

09:35.663 --> 09:37.263
I mean, no one would
do something like that

09:37.265 --> 09:40.066
unless they're being manipulated.

09:41.335 --> 09:42.568
Not unlike someone

09:42.570 --> 09:46.405
showing affection when
it made no logical sense.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.307
What?

09:48.309 --> 09:49.708
I mean, what kind of sick bastard

09:49.710 --> 09:50.943
would do such a thing?

09:50.945 --> 09:53.212
That's exactly what I'd like to know.

09:54.054 --> 09:55.920
Excuse me.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.610
Where are you going?

10:00.688 --> 10:02.988
Okay, look, we are
doing everything we can

10:02.990 --> 10:05.324
to trace that e-mail,
but in the meantime,

10:05.326 --> 10:07.760
did you have any connection
to the poisoned student?

10:07.762 --> 10:09.595
Or any idea why he was targeted?

10:09.597 --> 10:11.964
No, until yesterday I'd never
met him before in my life.

10:23.878 --> 10:25.478
Like that, is it?

10:27.248 --> 10:28.881
Excuse us, thank you.

10:28.906 --> 10:29.961
Fess up.

10:29.986 --> 10:31.477
What did you do to her?

10:31.502 --> 10:33.452
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to be more specific.

10:33.454 --> 10:35.321
I've done a lot of things
to a lot of people by now.

10:35.323 --> 10:38.324
Don't play silly buggers with me, Mum.

10:38.326 --> 10:41.360
The detective kissed me
and I need to know why.

10:41.362 --> 10:43.436
Did you say you kissed?

10:43.461 --> 10:45.264
Please spare me the
appearance of surprise

10:45.266 --> 10:46.699
and just tell me how you did it.

10:46.701 --> 10:48.434
Well, I wish I had that
kind of power, but, sadly,

10:48.436 --> 10:50.136
I can't take credit.

10:52.340 --> 10:54.707
Why are you so upset?

10:54.709 --> 10:57.910
I assumed you'd be pleased
by such a development.

10:57.912 --> 11:00.246
Well, I...

11:00.248 --> 11:03.883
I'm upset because I just
don't know if it's...

11:03.885 --> 11:05.384
real.

11:05.386 --> 11:07.419
All I can say is,

11:07.421 --> 11:09.743
follow your heart, son.

11:09.768 --> 11:13.300
These things have a way of
working themselves out in time.

11:14.529 --> 11:16.695
- Really?
- Hey.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.165
Detective.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.533
- Counselor.
- Douche.

11:20.535 --> 11:22.101
- Dick.
- Well, I suppose

11:22.103 --> 11:24.036
that's my cue.

11:24.038 --> 11:26.238
Remember what I said, Lucifer.

11:28.342 --> 11:30.476
Bye-bye, Daniel.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.447
I just came by to tell you
that Chloe's looking for you.

11:35.449 --> 11:37.816
Cyber got a hit off that e-mail trace.

11:37.818 --> 11:39.418
Great.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.387
Great.

11:52.533 --> 11:55.000
We traced the e-mail to a grad
student named Matthew Hoffing.

11:55.002 --> 11:56.235
He works here part-time.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.671
Libraries. Dreary places, aren't they?

11:58.673 --> 12:00.072
They smell like feet.

12:01.809 --> 12:02.808
I don't know.

12:02.810 --> 12:05.811
I think they can, uh,
be kind of romantic.

12:05.813 --> 12:10.416
Have you ever, you know,
made out in a library?

12:10.418 --> 12:12.084
What...

12:12.086 --> 12:13.552
Detective, what has
gotten into you today?

12:13.554 --> 12:15.821
This is usually when you
tell me to focus on the work.

12:15.823 --> 12:18.529
And yes, of course I've
made out in a library.

12:18.554 --> 12:22.117
Right. Yeah, I was-I was...
I've been trying to kind of...

12:22.142 --> 12:23.729
You know what?

12:23.731 --> 12:25.687
Never mind.

12:25.712 --> 12:28.634
It's definitely not getting
the reaction I was expecting.

12:28.636 --> 12:30.002
- Right.
- So, just... no.

12:30.004 --> 12:31.036
You know what? No.

12:31.038 --> 12:34.579
Since when have you've
been one to avoid sex?

12:41.349 --> 12:42.948
- What?
- LAPD.

12:42.950 --> 12:44.416
- Show us what's in your hands.
- No,

12:44.418 --> 12:46.189
raise your hands above your
head where we can see them.

12:46.213 --> 12:48.988
- Well, it might be a gun, Detective.
- It's not a gun.

12:48.990 --> 12:51.457
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:51.459 --> 12:54.393
Just...

12:54.395 --> 12:56.228
I don't know any kid...

12:56.230 --> 12:58.797
Ah, ah, ah. Better safe than sorry.

12:58.799 --> 12:59.898
Right.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.600
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:01.602 --> 13:03.369
I don't know any kid named Rick.

13:03.371 --> 13:05.137
You are Dee-man69, yeah?

13:05.139 --> 13:07.273
That's a very clever
play on words, by the way.

13:07.275 --> 13:09.441
Was "Nevergetslaid â„–1" taken?

13:09.443 --> 13:13.579
Yes, that's my e-mail, but...

13:13.581 --> 13:17.883
I only ever use it for... you know....

13:17.885 --> 13:18.651
porn.

13:18.676 --> 13:21.453
Care to explain why you sent
Johnny Kane a threatening e-mail

13:21.455 --> 13:22.655
yesterday at 9:10 a.m.?

13:22.657 --> 13:24.223
Busted, Mr. Hoffing.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.525
You may as well come
clean now. Pun intended.

13:26.527 --> 13:28.927
First off, I'm kind of
a fan of Johnny Kane.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.297
I think he's super talented,
but not enough to e-mail him.

13:31.299 --> 13:32.464
And secondly,

13:32.466 --> 13:33.799
I couldn't have
e-mailed him at that time

13:33.801 --> 13:35.934
even if I wanted to.
I was T.A.ing a class.

13:35.936 --> 13:38.637
- Oh.
- Here, I can prove it.

13:42.442 --> 13:43.507
Okay.

13:43.509 --> 13:44.642
There is an e-mail there.

13:44.644 --> 13:45.976
Oh, wait for it.

13:45.978 --> 13:47.044
But it wasn't me.

13:47.046 --> 13:48.379
Do they ever get less predictable?

13:48.381 --> 13:50.422
No, I'm serious. It must've been hacked.

13:50.447 --> 13:52.950
I didn't send that e-mail, and
I didn't send this one either.

13:52.952 --> 13:55.853
- What other one?
- This one, sent an hour ago.

13:55.855 --> 13:57.788
It wasn't me.

13:59.553 --> 14:01.625
Dr. Gwendolyn Scott.

14:01.627 --> 14:04.328
You're a world-renowned
thoracic surgeon.

14:04.330 --> 14:07.398
Who's saved an awe-inspiring
number of lives.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.167
Which is why it'll be
so interesting to see

14:10.169 --> 14:13.571
what decision you make
for this experiment.

14:13.573 --> 14:19.543
You can either destroy your hand or...

14:19.568 --> 14:21.512
Ashley Corbett,

14:21.514 --> 14:24.915
an innocent sophomore
at Malibu State, will die

14:24.917 --> 14:27.017
of poisoning.

14:27.019 --> 14:29.653
You have 24 hours to decide.

14:29.655 --> 14:32.990
Do what's asked, and an
antidote will be delivered.

14:32.992 --> 14:35.860
The choice is yours alone.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.632
This isn't just about Johnny Kane.

14:37.657 --> 14:40.265
We have to find Ashley Corbett now.

14:50.814 --> 14:53.448
Okay, Dan's with Dr. Scott.

14:53.473 --> 14:56.482
All we have to do now
is find Ashley Corbett.

14:56.484 --> 14:58.016
Look, once we get inside,

14:58.018 --> 14:59.284
let me handle this.

14:59.286 --> 15:01.353
Okay, Detective, in order to do so,

15:01.355 --> 15:03.489
we need to... blend in.

15:03.491 --> 15:05.428
Meaning?

15:05.453 --> 15:09.094
Meaning less hall monitor,
more, sort of, hot for teacher.

15:09.096 --> 15:10.262
So, do you mind if I...

15:10.264 --> 15:12.197
- Thank you.
- Right.

15:12.199 --> 15:13.932
- I got it.
- Well, come on.

15:13.934 --> 15:16.702
- You're staring.
- I... fine.

15:20.241 --> 15:22.303
Okay.

15:24.474 --> 15:26.078
How do I look?

15:26.080 --> 15:28.313
Beautiful.

15:30.017 --> 15:32.574
Um... but, um, one last thing.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.453
VoilÃ .

15:34.455 --> 15:37.370
No college rager is
complete without one.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.757
Right. Shall we?

15:49.804 --> 15:52.371
These are the future leaders
of America, Detective,

15:52.373 --> 15:54.339
engaging in sex, drugs,

15:54.341 --> 15:56.508
and lecherous behavior.

15:56.510 --> 15:57.876
Makes me proud.

15:57.878 --> 15:59.645
All right, well, don't
get too comfortable.

15:59.647 --> 16:00.913
Remember, we're not here to party,

16:00.915 --> 16:02.447
we're here to find Ashley.

16:02.449 --> 16:04.316
And she could be sick already,

16:04.318 --> 16:07.013
so let's split up and we'll
cover more ground that way.

16:07.038 --> 16:09.888
Right. Find the girl,
don't have fun. Check.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.523
Mm.

16:14.662 --> 16:16.128
Yeah.

16:16.130 --> 16:18.730
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

16:18.732 --> 16:20.365
I think I saw her an hour ago.

16:20.367 --> 16:23.769
- She's, like, way hot.
- Yeah, great.

16:23.771 --> 16:26.171
Uh, do you know where she is?
'Cause she might be in danger.

16:26.173 --> 16:28.340
Danger of getting wasted! Whoo!

16:29.610 --> 16:31.777
Ashley Corbett?

16:31.779 --> 16:33.846
Anyone seen Ashley Corbett?

16:33.848 --> 16:36.648
Uh, Ashley Corbett? No...

16:36.650 --> 16:38.917
- Oh, hello. Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

16:40.221 --> 16:42.588
Right, uh, yes, uh,
you're all very lovely.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.556
Very lovely.

16:44.558 --> 16:46.024
Dear, how do I turn this thing off?

16:46.026 --> 16:47.526
I'm looking for Ashley Corbett.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.496
Uh, can you tell me where she is?

16:49.521 --> 16:50.729
We'll tell you.

16:50.731 --> 16:53.565
But first you have to
do something for us.

16:55.836 --> 16:58.136
We are almost through, Dr. Scott.

16:58.138 --> 17:00.272
I really appreciate you
answering our questions.

17:00.274 --> 17:03.008
Probably should've called
you when I got the e-mail.

17:03.010 --> 17:04.821
I was afraid.

17:04.847 --> 17:06.444
It's okay, Doctor.

17:06.446 --> 17:07.779
We're here now.

17:07.781 --> 17:10.715
Can I ask you something, Detective?

17:10.718 --> 17:14.152
What would you do?

17:14.154 --> 17:15.580
If you were me,

17:15.606 --> 17:17.623
and it were your hand

17:17.625 --> 17:20.058
or an innocent girl's life?

17:20.060 --> 17:22.227
What would you do?

17:25.132 --> 17:27.031
I don't know.

17:27.034 --> 17:32.237
I've dedicated my life to saving people.

17:32.239 --> 17:35.908
Taken an oath to do no harm.

17:35.910 --> 17:38.644
H-How am I supposed
to make that choice?

17:38.646 --> 17:40.913
You don't have to.

17:40.915 --> 17:42.848
They've drawn blood
from the first victim

17:42.850 --> 17:44.783
and they're already
working on an antidote.

17:44.785 --> 17:47.386
That's great if they find the girl.

17:47.388 --> 17:49.655
But what if they can't?

17:49.657 --> 17:52.257
They will find her.

17:52.259 --> 17:54.660
I promise you.

17:54.662 --> 17:56.528
Some of our best people are on it.

17:56.530 --> 17:58.563
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

17:58.565 --> 18:00.732
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:00.734 --> 18:02.401
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:02.403 --> 18:05.037
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:08.342 --> 18:09.841
Right. Now,

18:09.843 --> 18:12.177
can you please tell me where Ashley is?

18:12.179 --> 18:14.379
Mm. Come with me.

18:14.381 --> 18:16.648
Whoa! Hey...

18:16.650 --> 18:17.950
Was that an earthquake,

18:17.952 --> 18:19.451
or did you just rock my world?

18:19.453 --> 18:21.787
I don't think so.

18:21.789 --> 18:22.988
You got a boyfriend or something?

18:27.661 --> 18:29.361
Definitely not.

18:33.274 --> 18:35.240
Now, I suppose what
I'm saying is, you know,

18:35.265 --> 18:37.035
how do I know that it's real?

18:37.037 --> 18:40.505
It's real if you're
two halves of a whole.

18:40.507 --> 18:41.974
If you're stronger together

18:41.976 --> 18:43.475
than you are apart.

18:43.477 --> 18:46.178
Right, right, but what
does that actually mean?

18:47.314 --> 18:49.314
Damn it, Lucifer, I was so stupid

18:49.316 --> 18:50.916
to think I could actually take a leap

18:50.918 --> 18:52.052
and trust you for once.

18:52.077 --> 18:55.178
I mean, a woman's life is on the
line and here you are doing...

18:56.611 --> 18:58.211
Wait, what are you doing?

18:58.236 --> 19:00.659
Well, I was actually working, Detective.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.160
Oh, my God.

19:02.162 --> 19:04.062
- Is this her?
- Yes.

19:04.064 --> 19:05.630
She's so pretty.

19:05.632 --> 19:07.265
Oh.

19:07.267 --> 19:09.935
Well, I-I mean I was
working and maybe, sort of,

19:09.937 --> 19:11.770
you know, asking about you.

19:11.772 --> 19:13.171
- About me?
- Well, we had some time to kill

19:13.173 --> 19:14.606
whilst we're waiting for Ashley.

19:14.608 --> 19:16.608
'Cause apparently
she's in that bathroom.

19:16.610 --> 19:19.244
Don't know what's taking her so long.

19:19.246 --> 19:22.314
Ashley Corbett. LAPD.

19:22.316 --> 19:23.548
Ashley.

19:28.455 --> 19:31.656
It just won't stop.

19:31.658 --> 19:34.659
So, this is where the...

19:34.661 --> 19:36.928
healing happens.

19:36.930 --> 19:38.563
It's cute.

19:38.565 --> 19:42.367
So, what brings you here?

19:42.369 --> 19:45.937
I have some upsetting
information to give to Lucifer.

19:45.939 --> 19:49.241
It's a revelation that
might send him over the edge

19:49.243 --> 19:50.275
against his Father.

19:50.277 --> 19:52.277
Okay.

19:52.279 --> 19:53.845
But considering

19:53.847 --> 19:57.149
that Lucifer and I have
a bumpy track record,

19:57.151 --> 19:58.884
I'm afraid he won't believe me.

19:58.886 --> 20:00.786
I'm afraid he might think I have some...

20:00.788 --> 20:02.454
ulterior motive.

20:02.456 --> 20:03.889
Do you?

20:05.350 --> 20:08.493
I'm not going to tell him
this information for you,

20:08.495 --> 20:09.861
if that's what you're asking.

20:09.863 --> 20:14.533
What if I say pretty please, hmm?

20:15.499 --> 20:17.967
Apparently that's
supposed to do something.

20:17.992 --> 20:20.472
Look, I understand that you have been...

20:20.474 --> 20:24.743
Uh, are the goddess of all creation.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.245
You're very...

20:27.247 --> 20:29.414
uh, tall.

20:29.416 --> 20:31.450
And most certainly

20:31.452 --> 20:32.717
quite powerful.

20:32.719 --> 20:36.922
But my loyalties are
to my patient, your son.

20:36.924 --> 20:39.558
Doctor-Devil confidentiality.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.927
But I'm not asking
you to break his trust.

20:41.929 --> 20:44.563
In fact, I'm asking you to
illuminate the truth for him.

20:44.565 --> 20:47.666
If he's going to make an
informed decision about Chlo...

20:49.002 --> 20:51.770
...about his future here,

20:51.772 --> 20:54.306
he needs to know the facts.

20:54.308 --> 20:55.907
Right?

20:55.909 --> 20:58.076
I said please, right?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.680
If this information is as upsetting

21:01.682 --> 21:03.381
as you're making it out to be,

21:03.383 --> 21:05.450
I'm not interested in
being the messenger.

21:05.452 --> 21:07.519
Afraid I'm too smart for that.

21:07.521 --> 21:10.589
So what you're saying is I
need to find someone he'll trust

21:10.591 --> 21:13.058
that is foolish enough to
help me deliver the news.

21:13.060 --> 21:16.057
That's the exact opposite
of what I'm suggesting.

21:16.082 --> 21:17.395
Thank you, Doctor.

21:17.397 --> 21:20.765
I know just the person.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.135
Now I see the resemblance.

21:26.039 --> 21:28.840
All right, well, call me as
soon as you hear anything else.

21:28.842 --> 21:29.908
Thanks.

21:29.910 --> 21:30.876
How is she?

21:30.878 --> 21:33.378
- Is she going to be okay?
- They found Ashley.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.547
She's in the hospital.

21:35.549 --> 21:37.849
But the poison must be
different from the first victim.

21:37.851 --> 21:42.554
The antidote they made,
it's... it's useless.

21:42.556 --> 21:45.123
But don't worry, we
will figure out a way.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.424
We always do.

21:46.426 --> 21:49.494
It just takes time. Okay?

21:49.496 --> 21:54.232
I, um... I need to get a glass of water.

21:58.972 --> 22:00.438
This is Espinoza.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.474
I need to get an update
on Ashley Corbett.

22:03.911 --> 22:06.311
I'm sorry. Can you say that
again? I can't hear you,

22:06.313 --> 22:07.879
there's a...

22:07.881 --> 22:08.914
garbage disposal...

22:08.916 --> 22:10.215
Doc!

22:10.784 --> 22:12.517
Don't.

22:12.519 --> 22:14.186
Don't.

22:18.892 --> 22:21.914
No!

22:26.186 --> 22:28.373
We e-mailed back a photo of your hand.

22:28.398 --> 22:29.922
Doubt we'll get a response.

22:29.924 --> 22:31.624
The killer knows that
we may be monitoring.

22:31.626 --> 22:34.026
That poor girl was going to die.

22:34.028 --> 22:35.127
I had no choice.

22:35.129 --> 22:37.043
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

22:37.068 --> 22:39.564
You had a choice not to be so foolish.

22:39.589 --> 22:40.233
Lucifer.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.901
Well, who's to say the killer wouldn't

22:41.903 --> 22:43.169
demand her other hand?

22:43.171 --> 22:44.770
Her spleen? Her heart?

22:44.772 --> 22:46.505
'Cause, believe me, there is no winning

22:46.507 --> 22:49.208
when you play by a
twisted tyrant's rules.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.611
Excuse me. Can I talk
to you for a second?

22:54.757 --> 22:56.746
You are out of line.

22:56.771 --> 22:57.884
Me?

22:57.886 --> 23:00.052
The doctor just destroyed her hand.

23:00.054 --> 23:02.054
When are people going to understand?

23:02.056 --> 23:04.557
Thou shalt not negotiate
with terrorists!

23:04.559 --> 23:06.837
Oh, surely you can see
this is a fool's game.

23:06.862 --> 23:09.973
The only thing I can see is,
you are letting your emotions

23:09.998 --> 23:13.366
get away from you. We can't
let our feelings get in the way

23:13.368 --> 23:15.047
of our work, Lucifer.

23:15.072 --> 23:16.971
We have to work together as a team,

23:16.973 --> 23:19.006
or else someone could get hurt.

23:19.909 --> 23:21.976
Yes.

23:21.978 --> 23:24.745
Yes, I suppose they could.

23:25.615 --> 23:27.181
Hello?

23:27.183 --> 23:30.951
I've got a delivery for a Dr. Scott.

23:30.953 --> 23:33.821
Uh, I'll take that. LAPD.

23:33.823 --> 23:35.422
Thanks.

23:39.962 --> 23:42.630
"I'm a man of my word."

23:47.236 --> 23:48.903
The antidote.

23:48.905 --> 23:51.138
We need to test this
and get it to Ashley now.

23:51.140 --> 23:52.306
Right.

23:58.748 --> 24:00.447
Boo-yah.

24:00.449 --> 24:02.116
Remember how I sent a
shout-out to my peeps

24:02.118 --> 24:03.884
- for other poison victims?
- Mm-hmm.

24:03.886 --> 24:07.054
Well, meet Monsieur John Doe.

24:07.056 --> 24:09.690
Now, according to my buddy at DHS,

24:09.692 --> 24:12.326
this guy was found in the cargo
hold of a plane in Chicago.

24:12.328 --> 24:14.829
Similar symptoms to our poison vic.

24:14.831 --> 24:17.431
And get this, the flight he was on?

24:17.433 --> 24:19.033
Came out of Los Angeles.

24:19.035 --> 24:20.700
So, he might actually
be the first victim?

24:20.725 --> 24:22.880
Mm-hmm. I mean, the only difference

24:22.905 --> 24:25.673
is he has hot spots all over
him, almost like the poison...

24:25.675 --> 24:27.007
Spilled on him.

24:27.009 --> 24:28.342
Exactly.

24:28.344 --> 24:31.946
But this stuff is so strong,
Dan, that it killed him anyway.

24:31.948 --> 24:34.081
I mean, we are talking

24:34.083 --> 24:36.050
designer poison here.

24:36.052 --> 24:39.154
Engineered from controlled substances.

24:39.179 --> 24:41.188
Each one just a little bit different.

24:41.190 --> 24:42.506
So, how do we get an antidote?

24:42.531 --> 24:44.592
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

24:44.594 --> 24:47.661
Designer poisons need
designer antidotes.

24:47.663 --> 24:50.764
This guy, our killer, is really good.

24:50.766 --> 24:52.466
I mean, bad.

24:52.468 --> 24:56.203
But really good.

24:56.205 --> 24:57.538
Oh, my God.

24:57.540 --> 24:58.739
I know.

24:58.741 --> 25:01.775
It's tough. But we'll
get through this, buddy.

25:01.777 --> 25:05.446
No. No, that photo. Hold on one second.

25:05.448 --> 25:07.581
Where is it?

25:12.355 --> 25:14.922
What?

25:14.924 --> 25:17.691
The same birthmark.

25:17.693 --> 25:19.793
Your dead guy from Chicago

25:19.818 --> 25:21.455
is Andy Kleinberg.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.163
The rich guy that we
looked into for the murder

25:23.165 --> 25:24.265
of that stewardess.

25:24.267 --> 25:26.834
We were searching for
a... a special package

25:26.836 --> 25:28.435
that was smuggled into the country,

25:28.437 --> 25:30.371
- Okay.
- We never found it.

25:30.373 --> 25:31.639
It had to be the poison.

25:31.641 --> 25:33.361
Kleinberg must've been
the one who stole it.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.267
And look what happened to him.

25:40.149 --> 25:43.350
This is the other
student that was poisoned?

25:43.352 --> 25:45.352
I'm sorry.

25:45.354 --> 25:46.954
I don't recognize him.

25:46.956 --> 25:49.590
It's okay. We just need
to ask you these questions

25:49.592 --> 25:50.824
now that you're feeling better.

25:50.826 --> 25:53.294
Yes. Now that your inside's
no longer bleeding out.

25:53.296 --> 25:54.395
Do you have any idea, Ashley,

25:54.397 --> 25:56.196
when you could've been
poisoned yesterday?

25:56.198 --> 25:58.799
No. I mean, it was a normal day.

25:58.801 --> 26:01.644
I woke up. I had a bio exam.

26:01.669 --> 26:03.837
Lunch at the dorms...

26:03.839 --> 26:06.006
Then I just, I went to the
gym, I couldn't even work out

26:06.008 --> 26:07.775
'cause my arm was kind of sore.

26:07.777 --> 26:09.476
Why was your arm sore?

26:09.478 --> 26:11.145
I don't know.

26:11.147 --> 26:14.315
Uh, I guess, 'cause of
the flu shot that I got?

26:14.317 --> 26:16.050
Do you think that could have been it?

26:16.052 --> 26:18.123
So, according to the M.E. report,

26:18.148 --> 26:19.764
the other kid got a flu shot, too.

26:19.789 --> 26:21.488
Ah. Well, what do you know?

26:21.490 --> 26:23.157
Ashley, where did you get the shot?

26:23.159 --> 26:25.192
The university health van.

26:25.194 --> 26:26.193
Great. Thank you.

26:26.195 --> 26:27.995
Yes.

26:27.997 --> 26:30.631
- Excuse me.
- Get well soon.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.400
The guy who gave the flu shots

26:33.402 --> 26:34.568
was Dr. Jason Carlisle.

26:34.570 --> 26:37.450
This is footage of a
car accident he was in.

26:39.608 --> 26:42.710
He was a professor at Malibu
until this video went viral.

26:42.712 --> 26:44.678
No!

26:46.082 --> 26:47.381
Want to know why?

26:47.383 --> 26:49.383
Because the poor sap saved himself?

26:49.385 --> 26:51.585
Correction. Because he saved
the dissertation he'd been

26:51.587 --> 26:53.921
working on for four years,
while an innocent college student

26:53.923 --> 26:55.622
working as an Uber driver died.

26:55.624 --> 26:57.257
He was publicly humiliated,
his wife left him,

26:57.259 --> 27:00.661
he lost his job, his entire
world spiraled out of control.

27:00.663 --> 27:02.496
So he took a job as
a mobile health tech.

27:02.498 --> 27:04.898
I thought our killer
was just raving mad,

27:04.900 --> 27:06.600
but he's trying to prove a bloody point.

27:06.602 --> 27:09.236
That everyone would make
the same choice he did.

27:09.238 --> 27:11.672
Saving their livelihood
over someone else's life.

27:11.674 --> 27:12.973
Johnny Kane's face is
his bread and butter,

27:12.975 --> 27:14.508
and so is the surgeon's hand.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.377
So he's recreating
his own moral dilemma.

27:16.379 --> 27:18.078
He's picking everyone by design...

27:18.080 --> 27:20.247
- The kids, the professionals...
- And he's not done.

27:20.249 --> 27:21.782
Unis searched the professor's house.

27:21.784 --> 27:24.885
They found files on over
a dozen possible targets.

27:24.887 --> 27:27.547
Okay. Well, we need to find him
or else we need to figure out

27:27.572 --> 27:29.251
a way to draw him out carefully.

27:29.276 --> 27:31.168
Or we could just get a big stick

27:31.193 --> 27:33.160
and poke the bear as hard as we can.

27:33.162 --> 27:34.056
What does that mean?

27:34.081 --> 27:36.463
Well, this man clearly
has an oversized ego,

27:36.465 --> 27:39.333
comparing himself to the likes
of Johnny Kane and Dr. Scott.

27:39.335 --> 27:42.302
If we threaten that ego,
trust me, he'll respond.

27:42.304 --> 27:43.370
How do you know?

27:43.372 --> 27:45.039
Because I know his type, Daniel.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.840
Used to live with him, in fact.

27:46.842 --> 27:48.575
Called him Dad.

27:53.392 --> 27:55.049
What are you doing?

27:57.053 --> 27:58.552
What are you doing, Detective?

27:58.554 --> 27:59.987
Sending him an e-mail.

27:59.989 --> 28:01.622
What?

28:01.624 --> 28:03.457
"You pathetic sad sack,

28:03.459 --> 28:05.559
"no wonder you didn't get tenure,

28:05.561 --> 28:07.428
your experiments are
as ugly as you are."

28:07.430 --> 28:08.962
Well said, Detective.

28:08.964 --> 28:11.031
Seriously? Insulting the serial killer?

28:11.033 --> 28:12.399
That's an awesome idea.

28:12.401 --> 28:13.400
Thank you.

28:13.402 --> 28:15.202
Also, his mask is a bit lame.

28:15.204 --> 28:17.204
Could be much creepier. Put that in.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.308
Chloe. Don't send this.
All right? It's not you.

28:21.310 --> 28:23.177
This is... This is, it's a rash move.

28:26.949 --> 28:28.582
That's great.

28:28.584 --> 28:30.250
I mean, what could go wrong, right?

28:30.252 --> 28:32.386
I mean, surely this won't
force the psycho underground,

28:32.388 --> 28:34.088
it won't cause him to
do anything crazy...

28:34.090 --> 28:35.189
Chill out, Dan.

28:37.779 --> 28:39.445
He responded.

28:39.470 --> 28:40.803
Ah, told you.

28:41.836 --> 28:43.964
With a link.

28:45.734 --> 28:47.434
Hello, Detective.

28:47.436 --> 28:51.171
You don't need that mask
anymore, Professor Carlisle.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.546
Ah.

28:59.548 --> 29:02.516
So much easier to breathe
without that thing.

29:03.752 --> 29:05.719
What do you want, Professor?

29:05.721 --> 29:09.590
What do I want? To finish my
experiment without interference,

29:09.592 --> 29:11.158
but here we are...

29:11.183 --> 29:13.198
Your experiment failed, Professor.

29:13.223 --> 29:14.428
We proved your theory wrong.

29:14.430 --> 29:16.530
The doctor chose to save
the girl. So, clearly,

29:16.532 --> 29:18.966
not everyone's as egregiously
selfish as you are.

29:18.968 --> 29:22.503
I am not a selfish person.
I was vilified for doing

29:22.505 --> 29:25.434
what anyone in my position would do.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.975
You went back for your computer.
That's not about survival,

29:27.977 --> 29:29.409
that's about stuff.

29:29.411 --> 29:32.346
It was about instinct, but thank you

29:32.348 --> 29:34.882
for reminding me why I'm doing this

29:34.884 --> 29:36.850
and for helping me

29:36.852 --> 29:39.953
to improve upon my experiment.

29:39.955 --> 29:41.755
Truth is, Dr. Scott

29:41.757 --> 29:44.925
only mutilated her hand
because she was being observed

29:44.927 --> 29:46.460
by you.

29:46.462 --> 29:50.154
So this time I'm
controlling my variables.

29:53.795 --> 29:55.068
Meet...

29:55.070 --> 29:57.538
Benjamin Tibi.

29:57.540 --> 30:00.574
Innocent student,
attached to a poison drip.

30:00.576 --> 30:02.976
And here, Leon Klem,

30:02.978 --> 30:06.446
accomplished track
star, stuck in a vice.

30:06.448 --> 30:09.149
If Leon simply pulls the lever

30:09.151 --> 30:13.053
and severs his leg within 60 minutes,

30:13.055 --> 30:14.288
Benji here

30:14.290 --> 30:16.957
gets... this.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.326
You guessed it.

30:19.328 --> 30:21.195
The antidote.

30:21.197 --> 30:24.801
Oh, and please, for your sake...

30:24.826 --> 30:27.668
don't waste your time
trying to make another.

30:27.670 --> 30:29.937
They're all unique,

30:29.939 --> 30:32.639
and the only place the formula lives

30:32.641 --> 30:34.241
is right here,

30:34.243 --> 30:36.343
in my head.

30:38.013 --> 30:39.880
Not bad for a sad sack

30:39.882 --> 30:42.216
who couldn't get tenure, huh?

30:43.078 --> 30:44.678
Professor, wait!

30:46.355 --> 30:48.622
Well.

30:48.624 --> 30:50.891
Bear officially poked.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.833
You have two minutes. Talk.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.569
It's simple. There's something
Lucifer needs to know.

31:13.571 --> 31:14.907
I think you should tell him.

31:14.932 --> 31:17.257
Oh, really? And why's that?

31:17.282 --> 31:19.252
Because it's about his beloved Chloe.

31:19.277 --> 31:22.111
He'll take it better from
you. You're his closest friend.

31:22.113 --> 31:25.247
Lucifer may be stubborn,
but he listens to you.

31:25.249 --> 31:26.882
Mm-hmm. Hate to break it to you,

31:26.884 --> 31:29.185
but if you're buttering
me up, it ain't gonna work.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.620
You have bad news to give your son?

31:31.622 --> 31:33.222
Suck it up

31:33.224 --> 31:34.790
and do it yourself.

31:38.629 --> 31:40.029
Good talk.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.764
God made Chloe.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.099
Yeah.

31:44.101 --> 31:45.367
He kind of made them all.

31:45.369 --> 31:47.803
No. Chloe wasn't supposed to be here.

31:47.805 --> 31:49.505
God put her in Lucifer's path.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.006
She's a...

31:51.008 --> 31:52.541
miracle.

31:56.781 --> 31:59.381
Granny Panties Decker? A miracle?

31:59.383 --> 32:00.816
Please.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.185
35 years ago,

32:03.187 --> 32:05.921
Amenadiel was sent to this
bar, where he sat down,

32:05.923 --> 32:08.324
had a chat, then blessed Penelope Decker

32:08.326 --> 32:10.860
so that she and her
husband could have a child.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.294
That child

32:12.296 --> 32:13.729
is Lucifer's partner.

32:13.731 --> 32:16.131
It's no accident that they met.

32:16.133 --> 32:20.069
Mm. So, what, Amenadiel
blessed Penelope's lady parts?

32:20.071 --> 32:22.137
Wait, is Amenadiel

32:22.139 --> 32:23.906
Chloe Decker's daddy?

32:23.908 --> 32:26.842
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.445
Think...

32:29.447 --> 32:31.747
about it.

32:31.749 --> 32:34.383
Haven't you ever wondered
why that particular human

32:34.385 --> 32:36.252
makes him vulnerable?

32:36.254 --> 32:38.587
Mm.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.523
But if you still don't believe me,

32:40.525 --> 32:42.825
there's something you should see.

32:48.180 --> 32:50.266
No luck. I called every lab

32:50.268 --> 32:51.700
the professor's ever
been affiliated with...

32:51.702 --> 32:53.135
No one's seen him.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.570
He could have built that lab anywhere,

32:54.572 --> 32:56.839
and the video link was untraceable.

32:56.841 --> 32:58.374
What if I made a mistake?

32:58.376 --> 32:59.608
What if by sending that e-mail

32:59.610 --> 33:01.410
I just sped up his timeline?

33:01.412 --> 33:02.678
There's two lives on the line here.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.712
Two lives that you're going to save,

33:03.714 --> 33:05.548
- Detective, I know you will.
- Exactly.

33:05.550 --> 33:09.418
- Found something.
- Please tell me it's good news.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.787
Eh, more like medium news.

33:11.812 --> 33:13.824
So, Kleinberg's autopsy came back.

33:13.849 --> 33:15.735
Turns out he didn't die of poisoning.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.059
I mean, he would have died of poisoning,

33:17.061 --> 33:18.727
except he was strangled.

33:18.729 --> 33:20.129
Impatient little killer.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.031
Since I finally got time of death right,

33:22.033 --> 33:23.365
I was able to ping

33:23.367 --> 33:25.034
Kleinberg's cell to Van Nuys Airport,

33:25.036 --> 33:27.770
where I got this.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.872
It's the professor, clear as day.

33:29.897 --> 33:31.870
So we can assume that
he killed Kleinberg.

33:31.895 --> 33:34.777
Right. But this only tells
us where the professor was.

33:34.779 --> 33:35.945
It doesn't tell us

33:35.947 --> 33:38.247
where he actually is,
hence "medium" news.

33:38.249 --> 33:40.516
Uh, can you rewind it to the part

33:40.518 --> 33:42.484
where he goes through security?

33:42.486 --> 33:44.753
Why, what are you looking for?

33:44.755 --> 33:46.375
Okay, freeze there.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.591
And then zoom in on the tray.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.093
Looks like a key card with a logo.

33:51.095 --> 33:52.227
Oh, definitely a bird.

33:52.229 --> 33:53.609
School mascot maybe?

33:53.634 --> 33:55.864
We checked every lab at Malibu State.

33:55.866 --> 33:57.633
Well, he wouldn't go
back there, would he?

33:57.635 --> 34:00.069
Trust me, when you get
kicked out of a fancy party,

34:00.071 --> 34:01.670
the last thing you want
to do is sneak back in.

34:01.672 --> 34:04.440
You do the opposite.

34:04.442 --> 34:06.108
Who's Malibu's closest rival?

34:08.279 --> 34:10.315
The lab in here is
closed for renovation,

34:10.340 --> 34:12.672
so maybe he's here.

34:23.456 --> 34:27.291
Well, well, isn't this a surprise.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.739
It's locked, Detective.

34:30.764 --> 34:34.268
But with that said, I'm
actually glad you made it.

34:34.271 --> 34:36.371
Why, because you'd like to surrender?

34:36.373 --> 34:39.041
It's a bit anticlimactic,
but very well, we accept.

34:39.043 --> 34:43.679
No, because now you get to see firsthand

34:43.681 --> 34:45.748
what I'm trying to prove.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.549
It's over, Professor.

34:47.551 --> 34:51.085
Afraid you're wrong about that.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.190
Acrylic glass, Detective.

34:55.192 --> 34:57.772
Please don't kill yourself
with your own bullet.

34:57.797 --> 34:59.495
We wouldn't be able to conduct

34:59.497 --> 35:01.530
the final part of this experiment.

35:01.532 --> 35:04.233
Time for you to make a choice.

35:04.235 --> 35:09.138
In this vial, an antidote
that will save Benji's life.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.507
In vial numero dos,

35:11.509 --> 35:14.109
poisonous gas that will kill you

35:14.111 --> 35:15.411
if you enter the room.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.980
Simple, really... You decide

35:17.982 --> 35:20.149
what's more important.

35:25.212 --> 35:26.384
No.

35:43.345 --> 35:46.123
- W-W-W-What are you doing?
- If I don't get in that room right now,

35:46.148 --> 35:47.155
that kid is gonna die.

35:47.157 --> 35:48.356
Word of advice, Detective.

35:48.358 --> 35:50.558
If you go into that room
right now, you'll die.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.759
What are we supposed to do?

35:53.476 --> 35:55.309
- I can save him.
- What?

35:55.334 --> 35:57.499
But in order to do so, you
need to go after the professor

35:57.501 --> 35:59.000
right now, before it's too late.

35:59.002 --> 36:00.368
- What?
- I promise you

36:00.370 --> 36:02.403
I can get to that antidote
without harming myself.

36:02.405 --> 36:04.539
- How?
- We don't have time to explain.

36:04.541 --> 36:06.541
Do you trust me?

36:06.543 --> 36:09.277
- Yes.
- Then go.

36:10.248 --> 36:11.981
Go!

36:24.094 --> 36:26.094
Freeze!

36:29.199 --> 36:30.899
Right.

36:38.175 --> 36:39.774
Okay.

36:40.310 --> 36:42.777
Oh!

36:59.696 --> 37:02.163
Oh, come on, Detective,
a bit of help here!

37:02.165 --> 37:04.199
I need you further away.

37:10.874 --> 37:11.873
Freeze!

37:11.875 --> 37:15.343
There's nowhere left to run, Professor.

37:37.067 --> 37:38.566
Lovely.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.343
I knew you'd save yourself.

37:49.246 --> 37:51.479
It was the only choice you could make.

37:51.481 --> 37:53.514
Put down the knife.

37:53.516 --> 37:55.550
It's not too late.

37:55.575 --> 37:57.703
You can still make a different choice.

37:58.788 --> 38:00.555
The right choice.

38:00.557 --> 38:02.523
You can still save that kid back there.

38:02.525 --> 38:06.261
You still don't get it.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.477
I didn't want anyone to get hurt,

38:08.502 --> 38:11.099
but I needed people to understand

38:11.101 --> 38:16.104
I'm not a monster, I'm human.

38:16.106 --> 38:18.973
You call it biology, call it God,

38:18.975 --> 38:22.610
but choice is an illusion.

38:22.612 --> 38:24.379
I didn't have one

38:24.381 --> 38:28.383
when I pulled myself
out of that burning car.

38:28.385 --> 38:32.120
And I certainly don't have one now.

38:33.961 --> 38:36.895
You'll understand soon enough.

38:53.143 --> 38:54.809
Where is he?

38:54.811 --> 38:57.412
Where is Lucifer?

38:57.414 --> 38:59.255
I'm right here, Detective.

39:00.583 --> 39:03.818
See? I told you everything
would be all right.

39:08.927 --> 39:10.825
I'm so glad you're okay.

39:14.130 --> 39:15.930
Hey.

39:17.233 --> 39:19.901
I guess we make a good
team after all, don't we?

39:23.340 --> 39:26.474
This is real, isn't it?

39:43.965 --> 39:45.465
What if he doesn't come?

39:45.490 --> 39:48.763
If he said he'll be here, he'll be here.

39:48.765 --> 39:50.431
Mazikeen!

39:50.433 --> 39:53.164
Interesting choice of venue.

39:56.940 --> 39:58.206
My, my,

39:58.208 --> 39:59.707
how the tide has turned.

39:59.709 --> 40:02.172
What's this, celestial
enemies' night out?

40:02.197 --> 40:03.945
Why don't you have a seat, Lucifer.

40:03.947 --> 40:06.848
There's something that
we need to tell you.

40:06.850 --> 40:10.785
Ooh, some sort of supernatural
intervention, is it?

40:11.721 --> 40:13.287
Well, doesn't matter what shenanigans

40:13.289 --> 40:14.322
you two have got cooking up,

40:14.324 --> 40:16.157
'cause, quite frankly, I'm too happy

40:16.159 --> 40:17.458
for you to spoil things.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.127
- Happy?
- Yeah.

40:19.129 --> 40:22.363
The detective and I... Sorry...

40:22.365 --> 40:24.966
Chloe and I are real.

40:24.968 --> 40:27.602
I mean, I didn't think it could happen,

40:27.604 --> 40:31.372
but it has, and I've got
this overwhelming sensation...

40:31.374 --> 40:33.908
I can't even describe it, but...

40:33.910 --> 40:36.411
I feel invincible.

40:36.413 --> 40:39.291
So come on, ladies, bring it on.

40:39.316 --> 40:42.818
Whatever it is, I'm
sure I can deal with it.

40:44.189 --> 40:46.656
Forget it. Come on.

40:46.681 --> 40:47.955
What?

40:47.957 --> 40:49.690
There's nothing to talk about.

40:49.692 --> 40:51.859
- What? I've only just got here.
- Go. Go.

40:51.861 --> 40:53.694
We discussed this, Mazikeen.

40:55.098 --> 40:57.231
No. You discussed this.

40:57.233 --> 41:00.001
And I don't want to have
anything to do with it anymore.

41:00.003 --> 41:01.369
I thought you understood.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.938
We're doing this for him.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.807
Is that it?

41:05.809 --> 41:09.243
Or are you trying to
get back at your ex?

41:09.245 --> 41:10.678
You don't know what
you're talking about.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.280
I knew

41:12.282 --> 41:15.416
- you were up to something.
- What the hell is this?

41:15.418 --> 41:18.939
What's Amenadiel doing with Chloe's mum?

41:22.091 --> 41:23.491
I think you already know.

41:23.493 --> 41:26.761
Don't toy with me, Mother.

41:26.763 --> 41:28.282
What is this?

41:28.307 --> 41:31.308
I've been trying to find
the right way to tell you.

41:35.087 --> 41:38.779
But there is no right
way, because the truth...

41:40.810 --> 41:44.812
...is... this is your Father's doing.

41:44.814 --> 41:46.614
Chloe...

41:46.616 --> 41:49.383
is His doing... He put her in your path.

42:16.946 --> 42:19.213
So...

42:19.215 --> 42:22.216
none of it was...

42:22.218 --> 42:24.018
None of it was real.

42:26.485 --> 42:27.617
Don't!

42:39.102 --> 42:41.269
Lucifer.

42:43.373 --> 42:46.841
Detective, I need to talk to you.

42:46.843 --> 42:49.877
Detective!

42:52.215 --> 42:53.214
Detective!

42:56.519 --> 42:58.419
Did you know? Huh?

43:00.056 --> 43:02.690
This whole bloody time, did you know?

43:05.428 --> 43:08.429
Lucifer...

43:08.431 --> 43:10.798
something's wrong.

43:19.094 --> 43:20.727
It won't stop.
