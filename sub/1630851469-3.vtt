00:09.320 --> 00:13.080
Torben Jensen stole a process
for the creation of biofuels.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.160
Redback?

00:14.240 --> 00:16.280
Could be the information
Alexander Kutiev withheld.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.920
Got this from across the river.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.040
It wasn't a bomb.
It was a biofuels attack.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.240
Torben's a wannabe arms dealer.
You're either a shit spy or in on it.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.440
Which is it?

00:26.520 --> 00:30.440
I had you on a short list of one.
Your dad said you weren't up to it.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.920
You're my boss because our boss
sees some game in that choice.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.960
I'm not giving it up, so get on board
or put in for a transfer.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.400
When you're ready, we'll tell them,

00:42.480 --> 00:49.160
but if we do that, we need to know
for certain I'm really your father.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.240
I'll call Dr. Hassan.
See how she reacts to hyoscine.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.640
You know, the side effects
are seizures and heart attacks.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.720
Small price, Beatrice.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.520
I don't care if you trust me or not
'cause I know the truth.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.320
How about I inject you with this
and then we find out for sure?

01:03.400 --> 01:06.240
In our line of work,
trusting people costs lives.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.520
We're not there yet.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.000
Get off me! No! Don't even touch me!

01:52.600 --> 01:56.560
You're making a big mistake. Big.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.760
Fuck all of you! I'll tell my dad.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.200
You've had enough, babe.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.080
Is she all right?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.160
Hello?

02:17.240 --> 02:20.760
<i>It's Adam Cornwell.</i>
<i>Sorry to bother you at this hour.</i>

02:21.840 --> 02:23.440
How can I help?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.400
<i>Well, it's rather delicate</i>
<i>and I probably shouldn't be asking</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:28.240
<i>after you carried the can yesterday.</i>

02:28.920 --> 02:30.160
<i>But I need a favour.</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:49.200
-Holly?
-Hm.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.400
Hey. Your dad sent me.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.280
My dad? One in three.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.760
Here. Come here.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.000
Have we met?

03:02.040 --> 03:05.480
Yeah, yesterday.
I was working with Adam.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.040
Shh! We don't talk about him.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.640
Come on. Let's go over here.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.560
Rough night?

03:12.640 --> 03:16.240
I don't know you. Do I know you?

03:16.320 --> 03:17.120
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.640
Here we are. Let's get in the car.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.240
All right. What are you doing?
Whoa. Stop it. What are you doing?

03:29.080 --> 03:30.040
What?

03:30.680 --> 03:32.080
He's gonna hate me.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.920
No. No, he's worried about you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.920
Come on. Here.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.760
Oh, God. There we are.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.160
All right?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.880
Please don't be sick in the car.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.720
Coffee and a Lion bar
and I'll be fine.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.640
I've told Zac Clark
you're not to be called to heal

05:07.720 --> 05:09.440
every time Number 10 whistles.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.720
Where are you up to with Redback?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.200
Well, find whoever's trying to buy
the BF 100 process

05:17.280 --> 05:19.120
and then we've got a trail to Adam.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.080
Keep me in the loop.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.440
Come on!

05:30.520 --> 05:32.440
Excellent work.

05:32.520 --> 05:36.000
All right, don't ram it, yeah.
It just... It needs coaching a bit.

05:36.080 --> 05:36.960
All right.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.640
Yeah. Exactly.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
Thanks.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.000
Have you got any developments
on the VX residue?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.800
-Our Russian friend.
-Oleg Adamov.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.000
Exactly.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.760
We were expecting feedback
two days ago.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.160
Yeah. I'll... I'll-I'll chase, yeah.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.840
All right.
Well, briefing in my office

06:01.920 --> 06:03.680
once some caffeine hits your system.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.400
I could get some more, if it's cold.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.840
No, I'm good. Thanks.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.840
Um... Holly...

07:01.680 --> 07:04.800
I was so sorry
to hear about your mum.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.120
Thank you.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.440
Such a shock.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.680
And you were looking after her,
weren't you?

07:16.760 --> 07:17.880
Morning.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.160
I see you two have,
um, introduced yourselves.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.400
Well, we did meet last night briefly.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.880
I'm sorry for landing on you
like this and for...

07:29.320 --> 07:30.520
Was I sick on your carpet?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.680
Hm, tiny bit.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.120
-Oh, God, I...
-Don't worry.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.920
We were glad
you felt able to come to us.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.240
You're welcome
to stay for the rest of the day.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.280
Tonight, as well.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.760
A bit of a packed schedule.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.440
I've got a cabinet meeting
and then the live-show debate.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.400
You should call your friends.
Let them know you're safe.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.840
I didn't say anything to anyone
about you.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.160
I know I was a right mess last night
but honestly, I didn't. I wouldn't.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.880
I didn't imagine that you would.

07:56.960 --> 08:02.960
All this uncertainty with the whole
dad thing on top of everything else.

08:04.680 --> 08:09.120
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go and lie down.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.120
You think she's OK?

08:31.200 --> 08:34.560
She decorated the en suite
with projectile vomit.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.600
I don't think she is OK, Adam.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.440
Right.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.560
Hi.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.280
You've been busy.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.600
Yeah, well, I had a brief window
between babysitting the PM

09:02.680 --> 09:04.040
5and wiping down his daughter.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.200
How messy was it?

09:09.640 --> 09:10.800
Yeah?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.800
Uh, yeah, all right.
I'll be right down.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.640
Katrine Poulsen's here.
Apparently, it's urgent.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.640
So, DSIS have intercepted chatter

09:22.720 --> 09:25.600
about a credible threat
to your Prime Minister.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.040
Source?

09:27.120 --> 09:29.120
A compromised troll farm.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.640
But also intel
from one of our assets.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.880
So, you'll need me
in this investigation.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.560
Right, well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves. What have you got?

09:38.640 --> 09:42.000
Well, we had an asset
embedded with a screw. See?

09:43.800 --> 09:47.240
This man here.
He's a regular visitor to Copenhagen.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.360
He joined the weekend Nazis.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.920
Shaun Graham.

09:51.960 --> 09:52.920
Listen.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.240
<i>They promised us the swamp</i>
<i>would get drained,</i>

09:56.320 --> 09:58.440
<i>but now we're flooded with Africans.</i>

09:58.520 --> 10:00.200
<i>At least the Poles were white.</i>

10:01.000 --> 10:03.760
Katrine, there's 100 of him
in every town. They're all mouth.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
But this guy's thing

10:04.920 --> 10:07.440
was aim for prime ministers,
heads of states.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.440
And?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.960
And Adam Cornwell
was on top of his list.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.600
-Shaun Graham?
-Yeah.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.560
I'll look into it.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.320
If that's all,
then I need to get on.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.680
Yeah, and he used the word "Redback."

10:21.840 --> 10:22.720
What?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.200
Redback.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.680
You heard it before?

10:45.240 --> 10:46.320
So, what's the deal?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.320
-Hello?
-Wait there.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.160
Guys...

11:04.920 --> 11:07.200
Have you said
the word Redback in front of Katrine?

11:07.280 --> 11:08.360
Of course not.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.440
The word "Redback."

11:11.520 --> 11:14.160
Never used it in front of Katrine
or anybody else.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.600
Nor me.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.480
She knows about it.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.640
Give me everything you have
on Shaun Graham.

11:36.720 --> 11:40.480
Hmm. He's been active for years,
so you must have some intel on him.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.760
I'm asking you.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.360
What is Redback?

11:43.960 --> 11:45.280
We don't know.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.520
Come on! For a spook,
you're a really bad liar.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.040
It's some kind of terror threat,
isn't it?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.360
And if Torben's involved--

11:51.440 --> 11:53.320
Tell me about Shaun Graham.

11:54.520 --> 11:59.280
Well... He worked in private security

11:59.360 --> 12:03.000
and he attached himself to far-right
groups in Denmark and London.

12:03.080 --> 12:07.240
He has no kids, but he joined
some fathers' rights organisations.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.160
OK. Thanks for the intel.
We'll get in touch.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.920
Hey, don't treat me
like the sandwich boy!

12:26.920 --> 12:28.360
OK. Go ahead.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.840
You can't walk or you...

12:33.920 --> 12:34.880
Uh...

12:35.720 --> 12:38.600
Wha... Sorry, Shaun. Sorry, mate.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.560
Fuck. Uh...

12:42.040 --> 12:44.200
You can't walk all over us
like we're a piece...

12:44.280 --> 12:46.120
Like we're a piece of shit
in the pavement.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.640
Sorry, mate.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.720
You can't...

12:54.800 --> 12:55.960
I've lost my thread.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.560
Forget it. You're not ready.

13:04.640 --> 13:09.840
No, I-I-I am. I am.
It's just nerves is all.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.960
Nerves, yeah?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.400
Yeah.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.360
You, too?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.000
Our man on the inside
has got jitters.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.280
And now you.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.520
You're tough.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.360
Get out.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.920
I made a mistake with you.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.440
No, you didn't.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.680
Mate, come on.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.960
What kept you going after Helmand?

14:02.040 --> 14:03.280
When you were de-mobbed.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.320
When you... When you couldn't sleep
for the nightmares.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.360
When you lost
your best mate in the blast.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.440
Archie did.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.120
My boy.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.760
Sorry, mate.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.840
And what did Cornwell promise?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.600
Give us our rights as fathers.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.400
He lied to your face.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.160
He might as well have ripped Archie
out of your arms.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.040
Even when you went to him.
To his surgery.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.280
Calling me mate!

14:47.360 --> 14:48.800
He calls you mate.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.680
Two minutes later,
he's calling security.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.280
I just wanted him to listen!

14:53.360 --> 14:55.640
He didn't give a shit.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.200
I'm not your fucking mate, Cornwell.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.400
You don't get
to throw me out like I'm nothing!

15:12.480 --> 15:14.160
I'm coming for you!

15:15.640 --> 15:17.200
It's cleaner if I keep the line

15:17.280 --> 15:19.040
that it's nobody's business
but our own.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.360
It's live radio.
The SNP won't press their advantage?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.040
I could sidestep that.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.040
Well, you underestimate Isla Robson.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.160
Holly is in no way relevant
to the referendum.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.640
A troubled young Scottish woman
who may or may not be your daughter?

15:32.720 --> 15:35.040
The girl you haven't been
honest with the public about.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.280
Meanwhile, the press assume

15:36.360 --> 15:38.560
a predictable penchant
for a woman half your age.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.440
-Look, I know this is hard for you.
-Don't make me the problem.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.920
-Can we talk about this?
-Not right now, no.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.640
We'll only arrive
at the same <i>cul-de-sac.</i>

15:46.720 --> 15:48.480
Well, I'd like to try.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.520
We can talk this through with Irene
at next week's session.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.360
There's someone who'll pull
your head out of your backside.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.120
How long has it been going on?

16:26.200 --> 16:28.720
Mrs. Cornwell?
Are you going to divorce?

16:28.800 --> 16:31.360
Will you be standing
by the Prime Minister?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.040
Tell them if they ignore
the confiscation order

16:36.120 --> 16:40.360
required by Section 168
of the Proceeds of Crime Act...

16:45.360 --> 16:47.520
OK, I'll be going with Adam
to Irene at 3:30.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
Put that in the diary.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.920
Shunt my four o'clock
on to tomorrow.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.120
Kelly, let me speak to him.
Two minutes.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.960
All right, all right.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.520
But, please, come on. Tell Archie.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.640
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see him
next week, all right.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.920
In a fucking contact centre,
where you can all watch me!

17:17.960 --> 17:19.520
Stone-cold bitch.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.640
What did you expect?

17:25.440 --> 17:26.320
OK.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.760
Change of plans.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.840
All right, so Shaun Graham
was regularly in Copenhagen,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.760
but most recently
he's attached himself to this lot.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.560
Big men in tights.
Not exactly a prescribed group.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.480
Adam Cornwell ran up against them
when he was Home Secretary.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.680
His family's bill?

17:45.760 --> 17:48.720
Skewed against dads,
according to the Brain's Trust here.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.880
Here. Look.

17:51.800 --> 17:52.600
That's him.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.560
And he's been using
the term "Redback?"

17:55.640 --> 17:58.480
Yeah, according to the Danes.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.040
That puts him at the top
of your potential buyers' list.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.120
But what's his connection
to Oleg Adamov?

18:05.240 --> 18:08.560
Torben crosses Adamov and then sells
the BF 100 to Shauny boy.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.440
Not unless he's got a backer.

18:10.520 --> 18:15.280
Shaun poses as a buyer,
offs Torben, steals the process?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.120
Does he have the nous for that?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.640
Why don't we have a file on him?

18:18.720 --> 18:21.960
I'm going to go
to Shaun Graham's last address.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.200
Take Marcus.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.480
Yeah, I'll be doing that.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.160
That's the one. Back entrance
to the therapist's office.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.920
Cornwell's on his way.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.120
It was all planned.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.440
Radio station. Man on the inside.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.320
Once clean shot you said.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.800
That option came with risk.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.920
This, it's an open goal.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.320
Adapt to survive.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.120
Cornwell screwed you
good and proper.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.960
You're gonna be a hero, Nige.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.640
If anything happens...

19:13.640 --> 19:14.840
I want a bench.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.200
A couple of hours from now
we're eating ice cream in Margate.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.320
But if...

19:22.000 --> 19:23.120
you know?

19:24.520 --> 19:25.800
A bench,

19:27.240 --> 19:28.320
with my name on it.

19:31.160 --> 19:35.360
So Archie knows
I wasn't just piss in the wind.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.320
He knows that already, mate.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.560
There's your chance.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.760
Do him proud.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.960
- <i>Hello?</i>
-Hi.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.440
What are you doing?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.920
-Put that down!
-You're jeopardising op security!

21:27.000 --> 21:29.360
I'm not an idiot.
I wasn't followed here.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.280
You're still not authorised.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.520
No, but I need to know
if that guy made contact with Torben.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.480
Oh, look.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.280
-See? Daddy was in the military.
-Yeah, that figures.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.360
Shaun Graham tried to join the
Paras, but failed the psychometrics.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.800
So, I see you managed to scrape
some intel off the back of mine.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.520
This way. Quite an operation, right?

23:15.200 --> 23:17.440
It comes with the top job, I suppose.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.360
Yes, ma'am.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
So... this is the way.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.440
Ooh! Look. We've got a reader.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.080
Fourth-rate, Heidegger.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.600
Well, you're the philosophy expert.

23:40.680 --> 23:45.600
Oh, no. No, I had to drop my degree.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.720
Why? Because you
were looking after your sister?

23:49.800 --> 23:51.040
Ooh!

23:52.080 --> 23:53.520
That must have been tough.

23:53.600 --> 23:58.160
Excellent.
Soft skills, Beatrice. Well done.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.640
Got it.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.440
We're in.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.840
How do you manage it?

24:47.240 --> 24:49.160
Well, luckily,
Irene had a cancellation.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.720
I mean, to have
everything on your terms.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.360
You said you'd only talk
about Holly here.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.920
You click your fingers
and we all jump.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.280
That's hardly fair.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.360
So far, so predictable.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.240
Irene Ambrose.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.640
He's in therapy?

25:24.240 --> 25:25.560
He's not in therapy.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.080
He's hacked
into Etta Cornwell's diary.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.360
What the fuck?

25:44.840 --> 25:47.360
-Who are you calling?
-The PM's close protection unit.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.320
He's hacked them too, or what?

25:57.960 --> 25:59.560
Might be a rogue officer.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.760
You think the whole world
should go along with your ideas.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.680
This bloody referendum's
a prime example.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.520
You know, I nicknamed him Polaris
when we first met.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.240
The Northstar.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.000
It was our private joke.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.040
I thought we were here
to talk about Holly.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.400
Polaris doesn't rise or set,

26:29.480 --> 26:33.560
but it remains
virtually in the exact same position,

26:33.640 --> 26:37.600
whilst all the other stars
just circle around it.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.400
I don't need a pregnant woman along.

26:49.480 --> 26:53.040
Shaun Graham is an MO.
He won't be a lone actor.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.600
We'll be there in eight minutes.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.760
She's not answering.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.760
What is she up to?

27:03.560 --> 27:05.600
-Try her again.
-Right.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.040
Hang on. We're an equal partnership.
Always have been.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.880
Is that your perception?

27:16.320 --> 27:18.280
Look, I know things aren't ideal.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.680
We decided a long time ago

27:21.760 --> 27:23.840
not to have children
and now with Holly--

27:23.920 --> 27:24.880
No.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.520
Don't make me the one that can't cope
with Holly in our lives.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.600
"I want to make this right."

27:38.120 --> 27:39.720
Is what he keeps saying.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.600
Well, you should start
by taking some responsibility,

27:42.680 --> 27:46.000
instead of shifting it on to me.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.320
That's below the belt, Etta.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.640
Have we made
radio contact with Beatrice yet?

28:08.720 --> 28:10.040
Still nothing.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.760
Zoom in.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.880
Where's she going?
Who the hell is that?

28:21.280 --> 28:22.120
Who's with her?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.320
Katrine Poulsen.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.880
We always knew
there was a strong possibility

28:33.960 --> 28:35.160
that Holly could be mine.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.040
Well, I've known shorter odds.

28:37.880 --> 28:42.640
So, now we
take the paternity test and...

28:44.000 --> 28:47.440
we adjust to the new reality,
whatever that looks like.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.160
We... We go public
after the referendum.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.960
We're honest. We explain.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.440
Yes, that may cause some upheaval
at home and in public life.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
Honesty?

29:01.760 --> 29:03.600
That is a joke, Adam.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.000
You can't even
be honest with yourself.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.600
When we were younger,
you used to let me in.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.720
But this whole public veneer...

29:16.000 --> 29:18.040
It's crept into our relationship.

29:43.680 --> 29:47.440
Even here in therapy, you're hiding.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.600
What feelings are present for you
when you hear that, Adam?

29:59.240 --> 30:01.000
Actually, I feel
pretty bloody annoyed.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.040
"Pretty bloody annoyed."

30:05.120 --> 30:07.560
That is what you wanted, isn't it?
To provoke me?

30:07.640 --> 30:10.920
Yeah. That's exactly why I came here.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.560
Adam, why might Etta
need a reaction from you?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.120
Given the expense
of these sessions, Irene,

30:21.120 --> 30:24.680
I'm relying on you to tell me
why I'm being attacked

30:25.400 --> 30:26.760
by both of you.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.240
I'm being attacked
for trying to do right by Etta,

30:29.320 --> 30:31.680
by Holly and by the country.

30:46.760 --> 30:51.720
You see, it's always been
just Etta and me.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.080
I have no idea what Holly
might mean for our marriage

30:56.160 --> 30:59.720
or even if I'm capable
of being a father.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.480
Then say you're scared, Adam.

31:09.480 --> 31:11.080
I am trying, Etta,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.680
against all the uncertainty,
I am trying my level best

31:15.760 --> 31:17.040
to hold everything together.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.880
Why is that
not good enough for you?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.760
I'm not asking you to.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.880
It isn't enough
to smile and pat me on the hand!

31:27.240 --> 31:28.640
I told you to stay in the car.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.960
What if they're rogue?
I'm your backup right now.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.920
I don't need platitudes from you.
I'm not a child!

31:40.920 --> 31:42.360
This is private space.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.760
Don't move.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.440
I lost my boy.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.640
I'm sorry.

31:52.720 --> 31:56.080
No, you're not fucking sorry!
I just wanted you to listen!

31:56.160 --> 31:57.600
Drop the gun!

32:01.800 --> 32:03.760
Exit the room, Prime Minister.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.760
-Get them out!
-Quickly, sir.

32:10.000 --> 32:10.880
Is this Redback?

32:10.960 --> 32:12.160
Do you know Torben Jensen?

32:12.240 --> 32:13.040
What's your name?

32:14.960 --> 32:15.920
Nigel.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.920
Nigel what?

32:19.000 --> 32:19.800
Braynor.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.960
Where's Shaun, Nigel?

32:21.040 --> 32:24.840
Are there other attacks planned?
A chemical attack? The BF 100.

32:30.320 --> 32:33.080
What does this mean?
What does it mean?

32:34.640 --> 32:35.640
My boy...

32:35.720 --> 32:38.440
I can get a message to your son,
if you talk to me.

32:38.520 --> 32:41.840
He's going.
You know where Shaun Graham is?

32:41.920 --> 32:44.320
What do you know
about Oleg Adamov?

32:45.120 --> 32:46.800
-Nigel?
-We're losing him.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.160
Nigel, come on!

32:48.240 --> 32:49.640
He's going.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.560
Nigel!

32:57.280 --> 33:01.280
<i>...Unharmed.</i>
<i>Unit 2 arriving in Kelton Road.</i>

33:01.360 --> 33:02.960
Fuck!

33:12.280 --> 33:14.240
Roger that. What's the criticality?

33:15.480 --> 33:16.480
Two fatalities.

33:18.520 --> 33:19.800
Who?

33:19.880 --> 33:20.880
Both CPOs.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.240
Three. Gunman
died en route to the hospital.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.840
-Where's the PM now?
-On his way back to Downing Street.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.000
Right. Get Beatrice and Poulsen in.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.040
Don't bring me problems, Jim.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.160
Stop whining and deal with it!

34:01.120 --> 34:02.440
Is it where we agreed?

34:05.720 --> 34:07.280
This is cold fucking feet.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.360
If you're bailing out on me,
I'm gonna come over and rip your...

34:11.760 --> 34:13.000
Fucking face off!

34:18.280 --> 34:19.920
You're in no state
to go on the radio.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.480
Violence won't change our values.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.000
Oh, my God.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.520
This is ridiculous.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.800
I'm gonna have them
bring the car round.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.640
Adam, you nearly died!

34:37.640 --> 34:41.160
This Shaun Graham must have found
Nigel at the Fathers' Rights group

34:41.240 --> 34:42.320
and groomed him.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.000
Yeah. But how did those two
get into Etta Cornwell's diary?

34:46.680 --> 34:49.040
William wants you both there now.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.360
Don't get used to it.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.520
Prime Minister's CPE's
been stood down.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.480
So, the decision not to call that in?

35:01.520 --> 35:03.680
Well, Shaun Graham hacked the CPUs.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.120
We need to focus
on the fact that he's still at large.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.400
Shaun Graham hacking the CPU
doesn't mean they were compromised.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.640
We prevented an assassination.
The man behind it is still out there.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.400
How did Nigel Braynor
get into that building?

35:16.480 --> 35:18.640
Declan, what have we got
on this therapist?

35:18.720 --> 35:20.240
Uh, that the appointment was made

35:20.320 --> 35:21.920
by Adam Cornwell's assistant
this morning.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.160
They didn't put that together
in a few hours.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.200
Ah, data from Shaun Graham's
laptop and phone.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.200
Mm-hm.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
OK.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.320
This is insane.
Get them to pull the plug.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.720
I'm doing my best. You talk to him.

35:46.360 --> 35:49.280
-Adam, I'm coming with you.
-There's no need.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.880
You're my husband.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.720
We simply tell the public
what happened.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.160
I'll look as if I'm scared.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.880
-I think you'd be justified.
-Adam?

36:24.960 --> 36:27.000
I can't give the advantage.
Isla, how are you?

36:27.080 --> 36:29.400
I just heard.
Jesus, why the hell are you here?

36:29.480 --> 36:31.360
You know me, Isla.
Not easily intimidated.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.760
So, it's not a ruse
to get out of beating me?

36:34.520 --> 36:36.680
Bad joke. We should postpone.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.040
Absolutely not.
No one here knows about it.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.280
Carrie hasn't been told.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.560
We carry on as normal.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.880
Carrie, how are you?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.760
Glad you could make it,
Prime Minister.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.320
We heard you weren't well.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.400
No, I'm perfectly fine.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.920
We'll have an informal intro
to kick off and then we'll dig in.

37:02.280 --> 37:07.480
Brave PM debates SNP
following attempted assassination.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.880
You could have
the most amazing night of your life

37:09.960 --> 37:12.920
but tomorrow
every front cover is his.

37:13.000 --> 37:13.960
Fully aware of that.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.440
If I were you, I would pull out.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.320
Advise what you like, Etta.
I'm not daft.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.560
The last phone call
from Shaun Graham's mobile

37:29.640 --> 37:30.680
was to this number.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.760
Fifteen minutes
after the assassination attempt.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.640
-Who did he call?
-On it.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.480
Phone records.
Have we got Nigel Braynor's?

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
Checking that.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.680
What about Shaun Graham's parents?

37:40.760 --> 37:43.640
Yes, thank you Miss Poulsen.
I think we have that covered.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.320
PM's been on the move.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.640
Where the hell is he?

37:46.720 --> 37:48.480
London City Radio.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.800
For the debate?

37:49.880 --> 37:53.360
He doesn't believe in leaving his ego
at the door, does he?

37:55.640 --> 37:57.640
You're listening
to London City Radio.

37:57.720 --> 37:58.520
Good evening.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.480
"We live in interesting times"

38:01.560 --> 38:04.160
has become the byline of our age

38:04.240 --> 38:06.640
and arguments
over Scottish independence

38:06.720 --> 38:09.280
rage amongst a polarised population.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.040
Our Prime Minister stands accused

38:12.120 --> 38:14.200
of gambling
on the future of the union

38:14.280 --> 38:17.120
with the Scottish independence
referendum.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.080
I'm live tonight with
the Prime Minister, Adam Cornwell.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.280
Good evening, Carrie.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.720
And the leader of the Scottish
National Party, Isla Robson.

38:25.800 --> 38:26.840
Evening.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.080
<i>Prime Minister, you've been vocal</i>

38:29.160 --> 38:31.680
<i>about the political significance</i>
<i>of the union,</i>

38:31.760 --> 38:35.320
<i>but tonight I'd love to hear more</i>
<i>about what's driving you,</i>

38:35.400 --> 38:38.280
<i>what losing Scotland</i>
<i>would really mean to you.</i>

38:40.200 --> 38:44.360
OK, Nigel Braynor
made two different phone calls today.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.520
These two.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.400
OK, that last one
was just before he died.

38:48.480 --> 38:52.520
OK, Shaun Graham called
a phone registered to a Jim Cryton.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.760
Got an address here.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.960
Get a strike team
out to Cryton's now.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.960
Code 4, 42 Manly Road. Jim Cryton.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.960
What have you got on this Jim Cryton?

39:16.160 --> 39:19.200
Isla, given your family history,

39:19.280 --> 39:22.160
this debate must spark
some strong emotion of you.

39:22.240 --> 39:26.800
Yes, my father, who,
of course, died earlier this year,

39:26.880 --> 39:30.480
was the second SNP MP
to serve at Westminster.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.320
He campaigned his whole life
for independence and was...

39:59.520 --> 40:00.960
I'm interested to hear

40:01.040 --> 40:05.200
if the union has the same personal
significance for you, Prime Minister.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.720
Well, I, um...

40:11.720 --> 40:12.920
I feel that...

40:18.320 --> 40:19.960
<i>I lost my boy.</i>

40:20.040 --> 40:21.840
<i>No, you're not fucking sorry!</i>

40:22.840 --> 40:23.680
<i>Don't move!</i>

40:31.280 --> 40:33.640
I'm sorry. I just...

40:35.680 --> 40:37.480
We seem to have just... Uh...

40:37.560 --> 40:39.320
We've lost the Prime Minster
just for a moment.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.600
<i>Um, if I can turn back to you, Isla.</i>

40:42.680 --> 40:46.000
<i>Your father was a fierce advocate</i>
<i>for Scottish business</i>

40:46.080 --> 40:48.680
<i>Won't independence</i>
<i>bring financial insecurity?</i>

40:48.760 --> 40:49.560
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

40:57.160 --> 40:59.440
Got a ping from a cell tower
on Shaun Graham's phone.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.840
-Where?
-West London.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.760
What is that?

41:02.840 --> 41:04.760
-Is that--
-London City Radio.

41:04.840 --> 41:05.840
Shit.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.280
Get the CTSFO out there.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.800
Secure the studio
and the surroundings.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.040
I need the location
on Warwick CPU now.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.000
Get internal CCTV up, please.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.320
Extract to Echo. PM's in studio.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.400
Here it is.
That's the east staircase.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.480
Here's a CPO.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.640
Who is that?

41:27.720 --> 41:29.120
Security guard.

41:48.280 --> 41:52.000
Right. Listen up, the guy
that Shaun Graham phoned, Jim Cryton,

41:52.080 --> 41:54.320
he's the security guard
at London City Radio.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.240
Get that image back up.
The guard.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.680
Closer.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.880
All units, east corridor.
Target approaching.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.400
Code red. I repeat code red.
Exits to lock down.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.560
Freeze! Don't move!

42:23.200 --> 42:25.800
-What? Is that us? Get it back!
-Have we still got radio contact?

42:26.640 --> 42:27.800
Oh, what the fuck?

42:27.880 --> 42:30.440
Look out, Prime Minister.
Drop your weapon!

42:33.360 --> 42:34.440
Who fired?

42:36.800 --> 42:39.280
-Somebody talk to me!
- <i>Urgent assistance required.</i>

42:39.360 --> 42:41.320
-Seal all exits.
-Alert all ambulance crews.

42:41.400 --> 42:46.520
Nobody leave the building, all right?
Who fired? Who fired?

42:50.320 --> 42:53.040
Levi. Looks like someone
was trying to make a point.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.840
He's pretending
it's business as usual.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.400
He's agreed
to doing the debate today.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.600
Adam doesn't respond well
to being handled.

42:59.680 --> 43:05.800
When you ignore our advice,
you imperil the entire nation.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.160
Can I buy you a drink, then?

43:08.080 --> 43:09.960
Could you put me through
to the editor?

43:10.040 --> 43:12.320
She's definitely the girl
the PM was snapped with.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.760
A call came in for you.
Your Scottish friend wants to meet.

43:14.840 --> 43:15.880
What were his exact words?

43:15.960 --> 43:18.720
Uh, "Tell Beatrice
meeting up would be prudent,

43:18.800 --> 43:20.720
as the underground
is running smoothly."

43:20.800 --> 43:22.520
I've been brought
into the inner sanctum.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.000
We need to use this now.
Get our country back.

43:27.080 --> 43:31.240
I'm being told we have
some important footage to watch.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.320
What's going on?

43:32.400 --> 43:34.080
Could we get
a monitor for the PM?

43:36.120 --> 43:38.960
I want backup out there right now!

43:39.040 --> 43:41.000
No agent gets left in the breeze.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.960
This could cost us the union.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.600
