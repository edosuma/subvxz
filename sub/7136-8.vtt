WEBVTT

01:46.033 --> 01:48.200
- Back in the 1950s,

01:48.266 --> 01:50.033
there was a game show
on TV called

01:50.100 --> 01:53.700
"You Bet Your Life,"
hosted by Groucho Marx.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.367
Every week,
Groucho would ask

01:55.433 --> 01:58.000
inane questions
and insult the contestants.

01:58.066 --> 02:00.700
A fake duck would drop down
on a string,

02:00.767 --> 02:01.934
and Groucho would go...

02:02.000 --> 02:04.133
- Say the secret word,
and win $100.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.200
- But not once did anyone
ever actually bet their life.

02:08.266 --> 02:09.767
Unlike in Oz,

02:09.834 --> 02:13.700
no one ever put their life
on the line.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.500
- The attempted assassination
of Governor James Devlin

02:16.567 --> 02:19.333
by a former employee of
the Oswald Correctional Facility

02:19.400 --> 02:21.834
has sent a shock wave
through this election campaign

02:21.900 --> 02:23.967
and the entire state.

02:24.033 --> 02:25.500
Devlin, who is listed
in stable condition,

02:25.567 --> 02:27.266
announced that he intends
to stay in the race

02:27.333 --> 02:28.333
for reelection.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.667
The suspect, Clayton Hughes--

02:31.467 --> 02:33.734
- ...At the Crown and Shield
Holding Center.

02:35.266 --> 02:39.500
all: Clayton! Clayton!
Clayton! Clayton!

02:39.567 --> 02:44.934
Clayton! Clayton! Clayton!
Clayton! Clayton!

02:45.000 --> 02:48.700
all: Kill Hughes! Kill Hughes!
Kill Hughes! Kill Hughes!

02:48.767 --> 02:52.533
Kill Hughes! Kill Hughes!
Kill Hughes! Kill Hughes!

02:52.600 --> 02:55.367
Kill Hughes!
Kill Hughes! Kill Hughes!

02:55.433 --> 02:58.200
- Sean?
- Lockdown?

02:58.266 --> 02:59.367
Lockdown!

02:59.433 --> 03:00.767
Let's go.
Move your asses now!

03:02.900 --> 03:04.200
Come on, guys.
Get inside.

03:04.266 --> 03:05.200
Come on.
Let's go!

03:07.600 --> 03:08.934
Get in your cell.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.367
Now.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.533
- Clayton Hughes is
a close friend of our family's,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.533
and though I find his actions
utterly reprehensible,

03:24.600 --> 03:27.000
I feel compelled,

03:27.066 --> 03:29.333
out of loyalty
to his mother and late father,

03:29.400 --> 03:32.533
to stand by Clayton's side
at his hour of need.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.667
I am therefore withdrawing
my name as a candidate

03:35.734 --> 03:38.333
for the nomination
of lieutenant governor.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.000
Thank you so much.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.333
- The niggas playing again.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.367
You two fucks
ain't selling enough tits.

03:51.433 --> 03:53.000
- What the fuck you mean,
we ain't selling enough tits?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.133
You bugging.
- Who sells more than us?

03:56.100 --> 03:58.133
- Desmond Mobay.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.100
- Fuck that Jamaican fuck.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.033
- Fuck you, nigga.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.867
Y'all motherfuckers get pumping.

04:04.934 --> 04:06.500
- Let's do this.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.400
Hey, Mobay.

04:14.867 --> 04:17.967
You gotta stop making us
look so bad, man.

04:18.033 --> 04:19.834
You dig what I'm saying?

04:19.900 --> 04:21.300
- I do what I'm told.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.500
- Yeah, well, we's telling you
something different.

04:32.567 --> 04:35.834
- I am not afraid of you.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.300
Or you.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.900
- Hey! Hey!
Back! Back!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.834
You have gotta learn
to control your emotions.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.133
Follow Officer Keating here.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.333
- You sending me to the Hole?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.600
- Not this time.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.333
Detective McGorry
wants to interview you.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.166
- I don't know no McGorry.
Who the fuck is that?

04:56.233 --> 04:58.900
- Homicide cop investigating
the Bruno Goergen murder.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.900
- I don't know nothing
about Bruno Goergen, all right?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.867
- Tell it to her.

05:02.934 --> 05:04.433
- Punk-ass.

05:12.734 --> 05:14.133
- According to the files,

05:14.200 --> 05:18.133
you and Leroy Tidd
had a little altercation

05:18.200 --> 05:19.967
with Bruno Goergen in the gym.

05:20.033 --> 05:20.967
- An alter-what?

05:21.033 --> 05:22.066
- A fight.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.633
- Oh.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.433
We was just fucking around.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.667
- You beat him to a pulp.

05:31.333 --> 05:35.166
- Yeah, well,
sometimes, we get carried away.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.400
He lived, though.

05:36.467 --> 05:39.166
- Not for long.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.967
- Look, I didn't push Goergen
down no elevator shaft.

05:42.033 --> 05:45.834
- If you didn't, who did?

05:45.900 --> 05:49.667
- The only one I know
grieving Goergen was Mobay.

05:49.734 --> 05:51.066
- Desmond Mobay?

05:51.133 --> 05:52.834
- Oh, yeah.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.467
The two of them had some
weirdness going on between them.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.200
- I'm here.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.467
- Sit down.

06:14.367 --> 06:18.133
Found out some very
disturbing news today.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.967
- Yeah, what's that?

06:20.033 --> 06:21.934
- There's
an undercover narc in Oz.

06:23.867 --> 06:26.567
- Shit.
- His name is Brand.

06:26.633 --> 06:28.633
Cecil Brand.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.633
He's over in Unit B.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.400
- And he's one
of your customers.

06:32.467 --> 06:35.834
- What do we do?
- Whack... his... ass.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.266
- Who?
- You.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.333
I want you
to kill that fucking cop.

06:44.734 --> 06:45.967
- No problem.

06:47.734 --> 06:49.100
- Go.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.800
- You know, for a minute,
I thought you was undercover.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.333
I mean, but you can't be,
you know,

07:08.400 --> 07:10.467
given the amount of shit
you were snorting,

07:10.533 --> 07:13.467
given the amount
of shit you been selling.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.800
It's crazy, I know.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.800
But that night
you were so cranked up on tits

07:17.867 --> 07:20.133
that your accent
suddenly disappeared--

07:20.200 --> 07:23.467
I was like,
what the fuck is that?

07:23.533 --> 07:25.633
And then your girlfriend--
what's her name?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.467
Kina?

07:27.533 --> 07:28.734
I was positive

07:28.800 --> 07:30.633
that I recognized her
from somewhere.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.800
Tore my brain out
trying to remember,

07:32.867 --> 07:34.300
trying to remember where.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.934
Then I had a flash.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.500
No!
No!

07:37.567 --> 07:39.867
When they threw me
off the roof...

07:42.266 --> 07:44.500
I was laying
on the cold pavement...

07:46.700 --> 07:51.166
And this woman police came over
to see if I was still alive.

07:54.233 --> 07:55.834
That woman police...

07:58.767 --> 08:01.133
She's a dead ringer
for your Kina.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.800
- Lights out!

08:08.567 --> 08:11.767
Well, good night, Mobay...

08:11.834 --> 08:15.367
or Officer
Whoever-the-Fuck-You-Are.

08:16.433 --> 08:17.700
Ah! Hey!

08:18.834 --> 08:21.800
- You talk that shit to anyone,

08:21.867 --> 08:24.333
you're next down
the elevator shaft.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.433
- All right.
Break it up in there.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.967
- I'm telling nobody nothing.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.967
I'm telling nobody
that you're a cop,

08:37.033 --> 08:40.300
a cop who breaks the law
all in the name of the law.

08:40.367 --> 08:45.500
I just want you to know
that I know you're a fraud.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.400
And I don't mean
that you're undercover.

08:48.467 --> 08:51.133
I mean as a person.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.834
You're a fraud.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.934
- He's still alive.
Get a doctor up here!

09:25.367 --> 09:29.033
- I murdered Bruno Goergen.
- What?

09:30.867 --> 09:33.400
- I committed a crime.
I should be punished.

09:33.467 --> 09:35.133
- Why are you confessing?

09:36.367 --> 09:37.867
- Because I took an oath.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.633
Because I'm not a fraud.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.467
Because I don't want
to be one of them.

09:58.033 --> 10:02.800
- The arrest of Detective Basil
for the murder of Bruno Goergen

10:02.867 --> 10:04.033
has obviously put an end

10:04.100 --> 10:06.500
to the undercover
narcotics operation...

10:06.567 --> 10:07.934
at least for the time being.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.500
- With all due respect, Warden,

10:09.567 --> 10:11.166
I think you're gonna
have to accept the fact

10:11.233 --> 10:13.333
that the war on drugs
is unwinnable.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.166
- You know, that's not true.

10:15.233 --> 10:16.166
We have to be diligent.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.834
We have to keep fighting.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.533
We can't just give up
on education.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.266
We have to rehabilitate.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.667
- I'm not saying
you're not gonna get lucky

10:22.734 --> 10:24.500
with a slug or two,
but if you think

10:24.567 --> 10:26.834
you're gonna eradicate
heroin from Oz,

10:26.900 --> 10:28.600
well, that's just plain stupid.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.867
- Who you calling stupid?

10:30.934 --> 10:32.667
- Hey, if the shoe fits--
- Fuck you!

10:32.734 --> 10:34.100
- All right, enough!

10:34.166 --> 10:35.700
- Pussy.
- Come on!

10:35.767 --> 10:36.867
- Stop it!

10:36.934 --> 10:38.967
Stop it!
Stop it!

10:40.100 --> 10:42.333
What the fuck is happening here?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.867
- Pete...

10:43.934 --> 10:45.700
- I am sick to death
of sitting in on these meetings

10:45.767 --> 10:49.734
and listening to you people
with your petty little egos.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.367
The walls are crumbling
down around us,

10:52.433 --> 10:54.166
and all you care about
are yourselves!

10:54.233 --> 10:55.934
Well...

11:02.433 --> 11:04.467
- Go after her.

11:09.133 --> 11:12.100
- Pete?
- No.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.000
- Shh.
I want to talk.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.166
- No, no.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.000
I'll be fine, Ray.

11:19.066 --> 11:21.000
No, really.

11:21.066 --> 11:22.767
I'll be fine.

11:29.734 --> 11:31.166
- I don't get cravings anymore.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.934
- That's horseshit.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.400
- What are you doing here?
- I'm an addict.

11:38.467 --> 11:39.834
I'm getting yearnings.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.467
I may start again.
I need your help.

11:41.533 --> 11:44.633
- I don't want you in this room.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.533
- Sister... you can't refuse me.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.367
- Oh, yes.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.533
Yes, I can.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.834
Take him back, please.

12:08.433 --> 12:12.133
So, Augustus, you were
about to make... some point?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.633
- Oh, yeah.

12:17.734 --> 12:20.166
- Hi!
- Hi!

12:20.233 --> 12:21.433
Oh!

12:24.066 --> 12:25.667
- I was gonna come up
to the office and see you,

12:25.734 --> 12:27.333
but I thought, no.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.333
- Listen, I'm surprised
you got this far.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.333
- Mm.
- How you doing?

12:31.400 --> 12:34.166
- Oh, small increments,
but better, you know?

12:34.233 --> 12:35.767
- Yeah.
- You?

12:35.834 --> 12:39.000
- Ah, I'm in a mood.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.633
Today,
I got the documents to sign.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.266
- Documents?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.200
- To stop being a nun.

12:45.266 --> 12:48.800
- So this lunch we're having
is a celebration?

12:48.867 --> 12:50.867
- I don't know.

12:50.934 --> 12:53.700
I still haven't made up my mind.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.867
When you join a religious order,
you know,

12:55.934 --> 12:58.533
you become a bride of Christ.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.200
It's hard to accept that, uh,

13:01.266 --> 13:05.033
when I put my signature
on those documents...

13:05.100 --> 13:07.967
Christ and I are divorced.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.166
- Oh!
Fuck me, you piece of shit.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.700
Oh, fuck!

13:44.900 --> 13:48.934
Okay,
what's the matter now, Cyril?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.233
- You and that woman.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.066
- What woman?
- Officer Howell.

13:52.133 --> 13:53.567
- What about her?

13:53.633 --> 13:56.266
- You and she are bad.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.367
- Huh?

13:58.433 --> 13:59.533
- Come on, tell.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.700
- Tell?
What?

14:00.767 --> 14:02.433
There's...
there's nothing to tell.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.367
- Wink, wink.

14:04.433 --> 14:05.800
I'm gonna tell.

14:05.867 --> 14:07.500
- Shut up, Cyril.
- Fuck you.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.033
- You shut up or I'll sm--
- What?

14:09.100 --> 14:11.166
You're going to what?

14:11.233 --> 14:13.967
I can take you.

14:14.033 --> 14:16.333
I can beat you up.

14:21.033 --> 14:23.633
- Jesus fucking Christ, man.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.734
Fucking place!

14:25.800 --> 14:28.667
- Here it is.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.066
I sign that document...

14:32.567 --> 14:34.533
I stop being a nun.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.166
- Are you gonna sign it?

14:39.900 --> 14:41.500
- Yes.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.834
Want to watch?

14:44.567 --> 14:45.667
- No, thanks.

14:49.066 --> 14:50.433
- Sister.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.667
Hey.
I really need to talk to you.

14:52.734 --> 14:53.834
- I was just leaving.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.834
- No, Father, please stay.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.567
I appreciate your input.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.300
- What's up?
- It's my brother.

15:02.367 --> 15:05.367
He seems to be okay
after the OD,

15:05.433 --> 15:08.533
but he's having
these terrible nightmares again,

15:08.600 --> 15:11.233
so he only gets
but a few hours of sleep,

15:11.300 --> 15:13.233
and I'm beginning to think
that the...

15:13.300 --> 15:14.700
What'd you call it?

15:14.767 --> 15:17.800
- Deprivation?
- Yeah, that.

15:17.867 --> 15:19.934
That that shit's just starting
to affect his brain.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.200
- Why, what's he doing?

15:22.266 --> 15:24.467
- Oh, he's becoming aggressive.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.467
He's making things up

15:26.533 --> 15:30.633
and claiming to see things
that just aren't there.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.433
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.967
I was wondering if maybe
you could put him back

15:37.033 --> 15:38.333
on some kind of medication,

15:38.400 --> 15:41.500
you know,
something to knock him out,

15:41.567 --> 15:44.100
just for a little while
until he gets some sleep?

15:44.166 --> 15:45.834
- Uh... all right.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.166
I'll-I'll meet with Cyril,

15:47.233 --> 15:50.166
and then I'll decide
what's best for him.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.166
- Okay.

15:51.233 --> 15:53.500
You got to remember this...

15:53.567 --> 15:55.834
the stuff he's saying...

15:55.900 --> 15:59.400
man, it's crazy.

15:59.467 --> 16:03.166
- And the nightmares
are always the same?

16:03.233 --> 16:04.500
- Pretty much.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.667
- Is there anything
in your dreams

16:06.734 --> 16:08.300
that you see when you're awake?

16:08.367 --> 16:10.400
- No.

16:11.867 --> 16:15.367
- Cyril, do you remember
anything before your accident?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.467
- Before I got hit in the head?

16:17.533 --> 16:21.600
- Yeah.
- My mother's hands.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.800
They were rough,

16:24.867 --> 16:28.800
all red from working...

16:28.867 --> 16:32.333
but soft when she touched me.

16:34.700 --> 16:35.834
- Anything else?

16:35.900 --> 16:38.800
- The cross.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.633
Like that.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.166
Around her neck.

16:43.233 --> 16:45.600
She'd pray to Jesus.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.200
- Do you believe in Jesus?

16:51.233 --> 16:53.100
- That's a silly question.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.100
- Why?

16:55.166 --> 16:58.166
- 'Cause it's not up to me,

16:58.233 --> 17:00.767
believing or not believing.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.767
We don't choose God.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.400
God chooses us.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.800
- Cyril, do you mind if I talk
to your brother for a minute?

17:16.867 --> 17:18.400
- Sure.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.000
- So?

17:23.066 --> 17:25.467
- I don't see any
of the symptoms you described.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.700
In fact, quite the opposite.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.633
- He's always on his best
behavior with you, Sister,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.100
but I swear to God,
the kid's--

17:31.166 --> 17:32.500
- Ryan, don't swear.

17:32.567 --> 17:35.133
What is true
is that he's exhausted,

17:35.200 --> 17:36.967
so we need to try
to find a medication

17:37.033 --> 17:38.800
other than the Haldol
to help him sleep.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.333
- Good, thank you.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.100
- I'll have Dr. Prestopnik
write up a prescription.

17:54.367 --> 17:55.667
Hello, Chris.

17:55.734 --> 17:58.333
- Sister.
- Stay where you are.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.333
As you know,
for the past month or so,

18:07.400 --> 18:10.400
I've been preparing
to leave the convent.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.000
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.066 --> 18:15.800
- Part of that stems
from the conversations

18:15.867 --> 18:17.066
we had together.

18:17.133 --> 18:21.266
You made me doubt myself
as a psychologist,

18:21.333 --> 18:23.133
as a nun,

18:23.200 --> 18:24.800
as a woman.

18:24.867 --> 18:27.233
- I'm sorry
if I caused you grief.

18:27.300 --> 18:33.633
- Oh, you caused me grief,
and I want to thank you for it.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.133
- What?

18:36.200 --> 18:40.300
- You know, Chris, most of us

18:40.367 --> 18:43.467
tumble into our lives.

18:43.533 --> 18:47.300
We become who we are
almost by accident.

18:47.367 --> 18:51.467
We try very hard
not to look backwards,

18:51.533 --> 18:55.166
afraid to find out that...

18:55.233 --> 18:56.834
maybe we should have done
something else,

18:56.900 --> 18:59.767
but you forced me
to look backwards,

18:59.834 --> 19:05.333
to question
every element of my identity.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.500
By questioning, do you know--
do you know what I discovered?

19:09.567 --> 19:11.934
I am a psychologist.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.934
I am a woman.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.934
I am a nun.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.934
And all of these parts of me
are not an accident.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.433
They were put together
by someone else,

19:25.500 --> 19:27.367
someone far greater.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.300
We do not choose God.

19:32.367 --> 19:35.166
God chooses us.

19:36.867 --> 19:39.967
- What happens to those of us
who he don't choose?

19:40.033 --> 19:42.567
Like in grade school--
you're waiting

19:42.633 --> 19:44.300
for one side or the other
to pick you

19:44.367 --> 19:47.734
to play... kickball.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.633
But you're too small,
you're too stupid,

19:52.700 --> 19:55.367
or maybe you're just too weird.

19:56.367 --> 19:58.967
All bullshit aside, Sister...

19:59.033 --> 20:01.900
I want God to pick me.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.333
Pick me?

20:08.967 --> 20:10.867
- Maybe he will.

20:10.934 --> 20:13.133
There's still time.

20:16.066 --> 20:18.333
- You know something, Sister?

20:18.400 --> 20:20.100
I don't think so.

20:41.734 --> 20:43.533
Oh, fuck!

20:46.500 --> 20:48.400
We gotta stop.

20:48.467 --> 20:49.500
- What?

20:49.567 --> 20:51.533
- This.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.033
- Why?

20:53.100 --> 20:54.166
- People are talking.

20:54.233 --> 20:55.367
- Fuck 'em.

20:55.433 --> 20:56.567
- No, you'll get fired.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.367
- What is this, O'Reily?

20:58.433 --> 21:00.633
I'm sucking your dick so much
you're losing your balls?

21:00.700 --> 21:01.934
- No, I just thought
that maybe--

21:02.000 --> 21:04.700
- This ain't over
till I say it's over.

21:04.767 --> 21:08.133
You start thinking different,
I'll crush these balls of yours.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.233
You got that, punk?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.000
Good.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.000
Same time tomorrow.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.600
Cunnilingus.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.100
Let's go.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.700
- There's nothing like
the thrill of gambling.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.834
Nothing compares
to that incredible feeling

21:26.900 --> 21:28.400
of anticipation.

21:28.467 --> 21:31.667
You wait breathlessly
for the roll of the dice,

21:31.734 --> 21:34.967
for the spin of the wheel,
for the flip of the card.

21:35.033 --> 21:38.967
You wait to see what fortune
fate will hand you.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.867
- Bob!

21:44.934 --> 21:46.200
Bob, you're alive!

21:46.266 --> 21:48.166
- Apparently so.

21:48.233 --> 21:50.266
- Busmalis, get to work.

21:55.934 --> 21:57.367
- What did the doctor say?

21:57.433 --> 21:58.867
Did the surgery go well?

21:58.934 --> 22:00.166
Was the tumor benign?

22:00.233 --> 22:02.567
- Yes, I'll survive, only...

22:02.633 --> 22:03.667
- What?

22:05.100 --> 22:07.867
- I have
this terrible scar on my head.

22:07.934 --> 22:10.367
They tell me in time
it'll go away, but even so,

22:10.433 --> 22:12.467
I'm embarrassed
to be seen like this.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.033
- Bob, you're so vain.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.400
- Don't get insulting.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.667
- No, vain is good.

22:17.734 --> 22:20.000
When you got out of the Hole,
you were kind of dragging,

22:20.066 --> 22:21.934
but vain means
you still feel alive.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.600
- Stop talking nonsense.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.767
- Scar's hardly noticeable.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.467
- Bullshit!

22:35.066 --> 22:36.767
This is your lucky hat.

22:36.834 --> 22:38.834
- I'm lucky.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.033
I'm glad you're still breathing.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.033
- Miss Sally
is really coming to Oz?

22:51.100 --> 22:54.200
- When she heard after my escape
that I went to her house,

22:54.266 --> 22:55.867
that I'm her number one fan,

22:55.934 --> 22:58.266
my goddess decided
she wanted to meet me.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.367
- Miss Sally in Oz.

23:00.433 --> 23:03.033
Next,
we'll have Seinfeld in here.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.166
- How do I look?

23:04.233 --> 23:05.400
- Truth?

23:05.467 --> 23:06.633
- No.
Lie.

23:06.700 --> 23:07.767
- You're very handsome.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.367
- Thank you.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.467
- Where'd you get the flowers?

23:12.533 --> 23:13.734
- That's a secret.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.033
Wish me luck.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.066
- Oh, you're gonna need
more than luck.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.066
- Miss Sally?
- Yes.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.967
- How do you do?

23:24.734 --> 23:25.800
These are for you.

23:25.867 --> 23:27.266
- Thank you.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.700
They're lovely.

23:30.734 --> 23:32.800
- It is a great thrill
to meet you, Miss Sally.

23:32.867 --> 23:34.367
When I got word
that you were dropping by,

23:34.433 --> 23:37.333
it knocked me for a loop.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.200
I am the envy
of every cell block.

23:39.266 --> 23:41.000
- That's very sweet.

23:41.066 --> 23:43.500
I brought you something.

23:43.567 --> 23:45.433
- Oh, my God.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.834
There are guys in here
that would kill for this...

23:47.900 --> 23:49.533
Literally.

23:51.767 --> 23:54.500
- Miss Sally,
I gotta tell you...

23:54.567 --> 23:57.667
You don't laugh
like you do on TV.

23:57.734 --> 23:59.700
And while we're on the subject,

23:59.767 --> 24:02.734
you don't look the same
as on TV.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.867
You seem smaller.

24:04.934 --> 24:06.934
- The camera adds 10 pounds.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.367
- To your breasts?

24:08.433 --> 24:10.200
- Fuck.

24:10.266 --> 24:12.800
- Miss Sally, you swore.

24:12.867 --> 24:14.934
What about yesterday's lesson?
Watch your tongue?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.133
- I'm not Miss Sally.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.633
I work as a secretary
at the station.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.600
I'm in charge
of answering all the letters

24:21.667 --> 24:23.133
that Miss Sally receives.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.633
When I heard about you escaping,

24:24.700 --> 24:26.800
I remembered
getting your letters.

24:26.867 --> 24:28.734
I thought they were so sweet.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.166
I went to Miss Sally
and asked her to visit here...

24:31.233 --> 24:32.567
- And she said no?

24:32.633 --> 24:33.667
- She got angry.

24:33.734 --> 24:35.000
She threw Nooter at me.

24:35.066 --> 24:36.734
- Oh.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.500
- So I thought, hell,
I look enough like the bitch.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.333
Maybe I'll pull it off.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.233
But I failed.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.500
- No.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.100
No, this means a lot,

24:45.166 --> 24:48.000
that you read my letters,
that you wanted to come.

24:48.066 --> 24:49.300
What's your name?

24:49.367 --> 24:50.500
- Norma Clark.

24:50.567 --> 24:51.967
- Thank you, Norma.

24:52.033 --> 24:55.667
- You're welcome, Agamemnon.

24:55.734 --> 24:57.967
- And if you don't mind,
I'd like to keep writing.

24:58.033 --> 24:59.467
- Of course.

24:59.533 --> 25:02.200
- But this time,
I'll write to you.

25:03.467 --> 25:04.600
- That'd be swell.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.667
- Everybody gambles.

25:08.734 --> 25:10.533
From a card shark
in Atlantic City

25:10.600 --> 25:12.433
to an old lady
scratching at a lottery ticket,

25:12.500 --> 25:14.433
taking a chance, risking it all,

25:14.500 --> 25:17.166
that's as basic
a human need as...

25:17.233 --> 25:18.834
food, clothing, shelter.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.834
It's as fundamental
to our genetic makeup

25:20.900 --> 25:22.967
as killing thy neighbor.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.934
- Deyell, what the fuck
are you doing over there?

25:30.734 --> 25:32.800
- I'm digging an escape hatch.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.567
- Dumb-ass negro.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.967
- Fucking cum sack.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.033
- Miles, hello.

25:48.100 --> 25:50.367
- No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

25:50.433 --> 25:53.233
- Miles.
- No! No, no, no, no.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.700
- Your execution is set
for two weeks from Thursday.

25:55.767 --> 25:58.867
Now, there are certain matters
we have to discuss.

25:58.934 --> 26:01.367
The most important being
how you're gonna die.

26:01.433 --> 26:02.700
- No!

26:02.767 --> 26:04.367
No, no!

26:04.433 --> 26:06.767
No, no, no!

26:06.834 --> 26:07.934
- If you don't
make up your mind soon,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.166
I'll be forced
to decide for you.

26:09.233 --> 26:12.266
- No, no, no!

26:14.567 --> 26:16.200
- Take him down to Psych.

26:16.266 --> 26:17.834
- No, no, no, no!

26:20.734 --> 26:22.667
- Get up, Rembrandt.

26:22.734 --> 26:24.133
Give me a--

26:26.233 --> 26:27.500
- Slam his ass!

26:41.200 --> 26:42.567
- Wait a minute.

26:42.633 --> 26:45.200
I can't talk to him
all chained up like this.

26:45.266 --> 26:46.233
- Believe me, Sister,

26:46.300 --> 26:47.967
you don't want him
running loose.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.600
- All right.

26:50.667 --> 26:51.600
Wait outside.

26:51.667 --> 26:54.367
- No way.

26:54.433 --> 26:57.767
- Wait... outside.

26:59.767 --> 27:01.200
Come in.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.533
Mark...

27:08.600 --> 27:09.834
The warden thought
it would be a good idea

27:09.900 --> 27:11.266
for us to get together.

27:11.333 --> 27:15.166
He says you're having problems
accepting the fact

27:15.233 --> 27:17.500
that the date of your...

27:17.567 --> 27:20.367
execution is approaching.

27:20.433 --> 27:22.967
- Problems?

27:23.033 --> 27:25.500
I'm scared shitless.

27:25.567 --> 27:27.367
I seen Shirley Bellinger go

27:27.433 --> 27:31.500
and that fag Ginzburg die
right there in the cell.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.967
It gets you thinking.

27:34.233 --> 27:39.166
- Look, I am not a fan
of capital punishment,

27:39.233 --> 27:41.500
and there are a lot of
others like me who are

27:41.567 --> 27:45.500
doing everything
they can to stop it,

27:45.567 --> 27:49.867
but that's not going to happen
before two weeks from Thursday.

27:49.934 --> 27:52.700
- Oh, Christ.

27:52.767 --> 27:58.033
- Mark, you made a choice
to murder your family,

27:58.100 --> 27:59.367
and as a result,

27:59.433 --> 28:02.800
you don't have a choice
about staying alive.

28:02.867 --> 28:05.200
So what you need...

28:05.266 --> 28:08.200
and what I want
to help you do...

28:08.266 --> 28:12.467
is to prepare for the end.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.333
- I know
what you're going through, man.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.967
Sometimes, the reality
of what's gonna happen

28:24.033 --> 28:25.333
fucks me up, too.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.700
- I don't need
your fucking sympathy, sambo.

28:28.867 --> 28:29.800
- You don't quit, do you?

28:29.867 --> 28:31.033
- I'm trying to work here,

28:31.100 --> 28:34.333
so shut
your fucking jive-ass mouth.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.333
- ♪ Amazing grace ♪

28:38.400 --> 28:39.834
- Shut up.

28:39.900 --> 28:44.033
- ♪ How sweet the sound ♪

28:44.100 --> 28:46.433
- I said shut up,
you fucking black bastard!

28:49.867 --> 28:51.467
Oh, fuck.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.367
- Holy shit!

29:27.000 --> 29:28.700
- Oy.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.333
- Yo, Lopresti.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.834
Can I get that mirror?

29:38.900 --> 29:40.333
It was Shirley's.

29:44.066 --> 29:45.667
- Oh, gee.

29:45.734 --> 29:48.633
Seven years' bad luck.

29:50.567 --> 29:51.500
Lights out!

30:17.767 --> 30:20.033
- Fuck.
- Step aside, Vern.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.133
Let a real man at the table.

30:24.433 --> 30:26.533
- Schillinger.
- Schilling-er.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.834
- Whatever, you got a visitor.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.166
- Yeah, well,
I'm not expecting anyone.

30:30.233 --> 30:31.900
- She says
she's your daughter-in-law.

30:31.967 --> 30:34.567
- My--
What?

30:44.100 --> 30:45.467
- Mr. Schillinger?

30:45.533 --> 30:46.467
- Yeah?

30:46.533 --> 30:49.333
I'm Carrie.

30:50.667 --> 30:53.734
Hank's wife.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.900
- Look, honey,
I don't know what kind of scam

30:54.967 --> 30:56.133
you're trying to pull--

30:56.200 --> 30:58.100
- He didn't tell you
he was married?

30:58.166 --> 30:59.734
- No.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.233
- Oh, God.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.767
- Are you okay?

31:09.834 --> 31:12.433
- She's fine.
Mind your own fucking business.

31:13.433 --> 31:15.700
- I'm sorry.

31:15.767 --> 31:17.700
I'm just so afraid.

31:17.767 --> 31:19.333
Hank and me met.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.734
We had sex right off

31:20.800 --> 31:23.066
and started hanging out
all the time together,

31:23.133 --> 31:24.700
and then, a few weeks ago,

31:24.767 --> 31:27.233
he came into some money
all of a sudden.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.867
He says, "Let's get hitched."

31:28.934 --> 31:31.600
So I say, "Okay."

31:31.667 --> 31:33.633
But now he's gone.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.367
He's disappeared off the planet,

31:35.433 --> 31:37.834
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.667
- You got any kind of proof
you two are married?

31:44.800 --> 31:46.600
- Our wedding certificate.

31:56.633 --> 31:57.934
We done it at city hall.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.967
- Why the fuck
didn't he tell me?

32:00.033 --> 32:01.567
- That's Hank.

32:01.633 --> 32:03.300
Mr. Secretive.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.567
- I know where he is.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.066
He went to Miami.

32:09.133 --> 32:10.633
I gave him money for the trip.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.767
- Miami?
When is he due back?

32:12.834 --> 32:15.166
- I don't know.
- Sooner than later?

32:15.233 --> 32:17.367
'Cause it's gotta be sooner.

32:17.433 --> 32:21.867
See, I got a situation.

32:21.934 --> 32:23.166
I need his help.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.200
- What kind of situation?

32:25.266 --> 32:26.667
Maybe I can help.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.934
- I'm pregnant.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.000
- What the fuck is this, man?

32:38.066 --> 32:39.867
- I ain't trying to hear you.
- The fuck is you saying?

32:39.934 --> 32:41.834
- I'm saying
get up out my face!

32:41.900 --> 32:43.500
- Trust me...

32:43.567 --> 32:45.500
I don't want to be peeping
your ugly fucking mug

32:45.567 --> 32:48.867
any more than I have to, okay?

32:48.934 --> 32:50.266
- Hey, what's the problem?

32:50.333 --> 32:51.967
- This fucking child
won't be talked to.

32:52.033 --> 32:54.333
- Nigga, fuck you.
- Mondo here--

32:54.400 --> 32:55.934
- I ain't one
of your dawgs, man.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.100
I ain't one
of your prags either.

32:58.166 --> 33:02.200
What I am is sick and tired
of all your bullshit.

33:05.467 --> 33:06.900
- Kids today.

33:06.967 --> 33:08.900
- We got to do something
to shut his ass down.

33:08.967 --> 33:11.000
- Yeah, relax, relax.
Listen.

33:11.066 --> 33:13.300
Got some ideas
I want to talk to you about.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.667
- Ah, trouble in paradise.

33:19.734 --> 33:21.834
- Yeah, but not enough
to be of any use to us.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.200
You know what
we got here, O'Reily?

33:24.266 --> 33:26.867
- Hmm?
- A fandango.

33:26.934 --> 33:28.700
And we gotta do
something about it.

33:28.767 --> 33:30.333
- Hey, I don't like
being in the minority,

33:30.400 --> 33:31.834
but what can we do?

33:31.900 --> 33:34.834
Even these fucking Muslims
are kowtowing to Adebisi.

33:35.934 --> 33:41.200
- Well, we could detonate
a few well-placed depth charges.

33:41.266 --> 33:43.300
- Whatever you need, K-boy.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.967
- Oh, my God.

34:04.033 --> 34:06.133
Help.
Help!

34:06.200 --> 34:08.133
Help!

34:08.200 --> 34:11.500
Murder!
Murder!

34:11.567 --> 34:12.500
Murder!

34:23.233 --> 34:26.266
- Like my day wasn't
already in the toilet.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.533
Do you know what
we've got down there?

34:37.600 --> 34:38.867
A dead fucking body.

34:38.934 --> 34:40.166
Do you know what that means?

34:40.233 --> 34:42.000
My record of no violence
is kaput.

34:42.066 --> 34:43.233
You know what that means?

34:43.300 --> 34:45.867
You are up to
your African ass in shit.

34:45.934 --> 34:48.767
- This is not my fault.
- Oh, yes, it is.

34:48.834 --> 34:50.300
We had a deal.

34:50.367 --> 34:52.867
I would let you do
whatever the fuck you wanted

34:52.934 --> 34:55.033
as long as you kept
the horseshit to zero.

34:55.100 --> 34:57.100
A corpse is not zero.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.033
- So what do you want me to do?

34:59.100 --> 35:01.367
- I want you to find me
the bastard that did this

35:01.433 --> 35:03.033
and bring me his ass.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.567
Alive.

35:04.633 --> 35:06.166
- You want me to play cop?

35:06.233 --> 35:08.700
- Life sucks all around.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.133
- Anything?

35:23.200 --> 35:26.667
- The dead guy, Shemin,
he was a complete fucking loser.

35:26.734 --> 35:28.967
He ain't had no friends,
and as far as we know,

35:29.033 --> 35:29.967
he ain't even have no enemies.

35:30.033 --> 35:31.600
- Found out one thing.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.900
Him and Tobias Beecher fucked.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.300
- Yup.
- Beecher?

35:35.367 --> 35:37.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Bring him to me.

35:38.734 --> 35:40.367
- I didn't kill Shemin.

35:40.433 --> 35:42.266
- I heard about
you fucked him, though.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.033
Once.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.300
He was lousy.

35:50.767 --> 35:52.800
So were you, Mondo.

36:17.734 --> 36:19.300
- The fuck are you doing?

36:19.367 --> 36:20.867
- I'm looking
for the murder weapon.

36:20.934 --> 36:23.500
Adebisi says that if I don't
find out who killed Shemin,

36:23.567 --> 36:25.033
they're gonna beat
the shit out of me.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.633
- Get the fuck off
my stuff, man.

36:26.700 --> 36:29.233
- I saw you
go into the laundry room

36:29.300 --> 36:30.667
with Shemin.

36:30.734 --> 36:32.133
I saw you come out alone.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.166
- That don't mean dick.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.166
- Why did you do it?

36:35.233 --> 36:37.000
Why did you kill him?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.700
- See this tat?

36:42.767 --> 36:46.367
I got it the night
of my second marriage in Vegas.

36:46.433 --> 36:49.934
I'd just run this great Ponzi
on some elderly couple.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.033
So, you know, I'm celebrating.

36:52.100 --> 36:57.367
Some single malt, a little X,
and a whole lot of Bonnie.

36:57.433 --> 36:59.133
And as we fucked,

36:59.200 --> 37:02.867
I kept yelling,
"I'm a god. I'm a fucking god!"

37:02.934 --> 37:04.633
I am fucking tripping
out of my mind.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.133
I go to this all-night
tattoo parlor

37:06.200 --> 37:09.000
because I wanted every slob
on the strip to know...

37:10.266 --> 37:14.200
I was almighty.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.567
But I'm not.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.800
See, I know that now,
Beecher, but this tattoo,

37:17.867 --> 37:20.834
it ain't going away,
not without a lot more blood.

37:20.900 --> 37:24.367
- And I am supposed to glean
what from that story?

37:24.433 --> 37:26.700
- Well...

37:28.400 --> 37:32.500
I see you fucking
all these other guys, you know.

37:32.567 --> 37:33.500
- You said
you didn't care who I fucked.

37:33.567 --> 37:34.500
- I do.

37:34.567 --> 37:36.200
I do, okay?

37:36.266 --> 37:40.500
- And you killed Shemin
'cause he and I fucked?

37:40.567 --> 37:42.600
- Ooh, I don't...

37:50.100 --> 37:51.367
- I'm gonna tell Adebisi
what I know.

37:51.433 --> 37:52.834
- Oh, I don't think you will.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.867
- Why not?
- Well, for two reasons.

37:54.934 --> 37:56.300
One, I know you hired Pancamo

37:56.367 --> 37:58.200
to put a hit out
on Hank Schillinger.

37:58.266 --> 38:00.266
- No way.
- Oh, yeah.

38:00.333 --> 38:03.700
And Hank's dead,
and Vern doesn't know it, but...

38:03.767 --> 38:05.367
That's only because
Pancamo makes sure

38:05.433 --> 38:07.533
no one's gonna find the body.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.367
Let's say they do,
you know, find the body.

38:10.433 --> 38:12.133
Schillinger's gonna
come back after you,

38:12.200 --> 38:14.133
and he's gonna destroy
the rest of your family.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.967
He will murder Holly.

38:16.033 --> 38:18.066
- Fuck you.
- The second reason is...

38:19.867 --> 38:20.967
You tell him I killed Shemin,

38:21.033 --> 38:24.333
they will kill me, but...

38:24.400 --> 38:27.033
I think you love me too much
to see that happen.

38:28.533 --> 38:31.667
Hey, Mondo.
How's it hanging, baby?

38:31.734 --> 38:33.834
How is Brown in bed?

38:35.233 --> 38:36.834
- Chris, don't.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.500
- You should take care
of where you stick your dick.

38:38.567 --> 38:41.533
That baby is lethal.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.333
- You know, I liked it better
when we weren't speaking.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.834
- Winning and losing--
the two sides

38:45.900 --> 38:47.333
of the same silver dollar.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.300
But winning isn't
always a good thing.

38:49.367 --> 38:50.667
Think on it.

38:50.734 --> 38:52.800
You suddenly come
into a lot of cash.

38:52.867 --> 38:54.667
You start worrying
about how to spend it,

38:54.734 --> 38:56.600
how to save it, invest it.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.533
You buy all this stuff
you don't really need,

38:58.600 --> 39:00.667
and you get weighed
the fuck down.

39:00.734 --> 39:04.700
Losing, on the other hand,
has a kind of purifying effect.

39:04.767 --> 39:06.200
When you got nothing,

39:06.266 --> 39:09.200
when you're stripped
of all the doodads in life,

39:09.266 --> 39:10.934
you're free.

39:17.533 --> 39:19.967
- Supreme Allah.

39:20.033 --> 39:22.133
What is up with Mondo Brown?

39:22.200 --> 39:24.300
I mean,
that boy's nothing but trouble.

39:24.367 --> 39:27.633
Just a deluxe pain in the ass.

39:49.567 --> 39:51.000
- You take care
of the other thing?

39:51.066 --> 39:52.333
- Yeah, I made your phone call.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.834
Delivery truck's
gonna get a flat tire.

39:55.900 --> 39:57.467
- Sweet.

40:19.266 --> 40:20.400
- Brown, get in line!

40:20.467 --> 40:21.700
- I'm waiting on a shipment.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.300
The motherfucking truck
caught a flat.

40:23.367 --> 40:24.867
If we miss
that shipment tomorrow,

40:24.934 --> 40:26.400
we don't have no breakfast.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.867
- I'll be back for you later.

40:27.934 --> 40:29.934
Everybody else, let's go!

40:47.934 --> 40:50.033
- Looking for these?

40:50.100 --> 40:53.734
- Keller, what the fuck
are you doing here?

40:53.800 --> 40:56.100
- You and me,
we got personal business to do.

40:58.967 --> 41:00.800
- I ain't got
no business with you.

41:02.467 --> 41:04.934
- How'd you like a blow job?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.200
- Sure.

41:12.033 --> 41:15.533
- Brown is dead.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.533
- Bullshit.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.533
- Murdered in the cafeteria.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.800
- Hey, that's not Em City.

41:20.867 --> 41:23.300
- He's still one of ours,
Adebisi.

41:23.367 --> 41:25.734
Glynn is pissed off royal.

41:25.800 --> 41:29.300
Everything we've built
is on the verge of collapsing.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.767
- We found this at the scene.

41:34.834 --> 41:39.066
- Do you know
who the necklace belongs to?

41:39.133 --> 41:40.967
- Yes.

41:46.433 --> 41:48.200
- Come on.
- What's up, man?

41:48.266 --> 41:49.734
- Come on!
- What's up?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.433
- Ay, yo...

42:15.233 --> 42:16.767
- You killed Shemin.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.367
- What the fuck
am I gonna kill Shemin for?

42:18.433 --> 42:19.867
He was nothing.

42:19.934 --> 42:21.867
- You killed Brown.

42:21.934 --> 42:23.200
- See?

42:23.266 --> 42:24.533
- Now,
that shit must've fell off

42:24.600 --> 42:26.533
when I was working
in the kitchen.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.300
- Yeah?
You cocksucker!

42:30.367 --> 42:32.100
- Fuck you, bitch!

42:32.166 --> 42:34.533
- Yeah, fuck me?
Fuck you!

42:34.600 --> 42:37.300
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

42:37.367 --> 42:39.033
Bitch!
Fuck you!

42:39.100 --> 42:40.433
Fucking kill you!

42:40.500 --> 42:41.667
Fucking up my...

42:41.734 --> 42:43.166
- Fuck you!

42:45.100 --> 42:47.300
- Look what was under
Supreme's pillow.

42:47.367 --> 42:49.066
- That fucking shit ain't mine!

42:49.133 --> 42:50.467
Fuck!

42:50.533 --> 42:53.066
Motherfucker,
this is some fucking bullshit!

42:53.133 --> 42:54.367
Get the fuck off me!

42:54.433 --> 42:56.066
This is fucking bullshit!

42:56.133 --> 42:57.734
Get the fuck off me!

42:57.800 --> 42:59.066
Get the fuck off!

42:59.133 --> 43:02.100
I didn't fucking do that shit!

43:10.800 --> 43:12.767
- Let 'em out.

43:36.266 --> 43:38.500
- Deaths of Shemin and Brown.

43:38.567 --> 43:40.133
This is the hand of God.

43:40.200 --> 43:43.633
- Maybe, but do their deaths
fit in with your plan

43:43.700 --> 43:45.166
to bring Adebisi down?

43:45.233 --> 43:46.834
- Oh, yes.

43:46.900 --> 43:51.200
I'm getting close to Adebisi
to find that one flaw...

43:51.266 --> 43:53.700
that'll finally cripple him.

43:53.767 --> 43:56.266
- I hope it happens soon.

44:03.133 --> 44:05.166
- Adebisi?

44:12.567 --> 44:14.600
- Grind slowly.

44:18.900 --> 44:20.834
I said slow!
Grind slow!

44:20.900 --> 44:22.600
Do it slow like a woman.

44:27.600 --> 44:28.633
- Wait here.

44:31.934 --> 44:35.867
- Man, I got to admit,
I was struck stupid

44:35.934 --> 44:38.333
when you joined forces
with Adebisi, man.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.100
What he's up to--

44:40.166 --> 44:42.200
Hold on.

44:52.934 --> 44:55.033
Man, given what you believe in,

44:55.100 --> 44:57.734
man, it's tough to take
this conversion seriously.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.700
- I swore to Allah.

44:59.767 --> 45:01.200
- I think that swearing of yours

45:01.266 --> 45:05.066
got something to do
with you trying to stop him.

45:05.133 --> 45:07.367
- You always did have
a very vivid imagination.

45:07.433 --> 45:09.400
- I'll tell you what else I got.

45:09.467 --> 45:12.333
I got the knack
for picking winners and losers,

45:12.400 --> 45:14.567
and you, you're gonna win.

45:14.633 --> 45:16.700
Sure hope to shit you do.

45:16.767 --> 45:18.333
- What's the matter, Poet?
You done with gangster life?

45:18.400 --> 45:19.767
- Man, I ain't done with shit

45:19.834 --> 45:23.667
except Adebisi
and fucking videotapes.

45:23.734 --> 45:25.333
- Videotapes?

45:25.400 --> 45:29.433
- Yeah, he likes to record
his antics for posterity.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.333
- You talking about the sex
and the drugs, right?

45:31.400 --> 45:33.467
- Live from Party Central.

45:33.533 --> 45:36.834
- These videotapes,
can you get ahold of them?

45:38.767 --> 45:40.333
- He keeps them in his pod.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.000
I mean...

45:42.066 --> 45:43.767
I mean, I could try.

45:43.834 --> 45:46.000
- Do it now.

46:02.266 --> 46:03.700
- Simon,
can I have a word, please?

46:03.767 --> 46:05.900
- Yeah, go ahead.

46:05.967 --> 46:07.467
- In private.

46:20.133 --> 46:23.166
- Gonna get all the young
brothers to go to class,

46:23.233 --> 46:25.333
get an education.

46:25.400 --> 46:26.500
Yeah, you like that, huh?

46:26.567 --> 46:28.033
- Yeah, excellent.

46:45.433 --> 46:48.033
- You say a word

46:48.100 --> 46:50.633
about me being in here,
you're dead.

46:50.700 --> 46:52.700
You hear me?
You hear me?

46:52.767 --> 46:54.800
- Simon, I'm not done
talking with you yet.

46:54.867 --> 46:57.033
- We'll talk later.

46:57.100 --> 46:59.700
- But we have to
let Querns know.

46:59.767 --> 47:01.400
- Yeah, later.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.500
- They're in the ceiling tiles,

47:18.567 --> 47:20.700
but I didn't get
a chance to get one.

47:27.667 --> 47:30.166
- Lots of Native Americans,
AKA Indians,

47:30.233 --> 47:32.900
used to live on reservations
in utter poverty.

47:32.967 --> 47:34.700
Alcoholism was rampant.

47:34.767 --> 47:36.266
Morale was low.

47:36.333 --> 47:39.000
Then some chief
got the brainstorm idea

47:39.066 --> 47:41.667
to use the land
not to hunt buffalo

47:41.734 --> 47:44.500
but to raise money
by building a casino.

47:44.567 --> 47:46.667
Then faster than
you can say "Custer,"

47:46.734 --> 47:48.133
the lives
of the members of the tribe

47:48.200 --> 47:50.100
changed for the better.

47:50.166 --> 47:51.367
So, you see,

47:51.433 --> 47:54.033
sometimes,
you can eliminate your own vices

47:54.100 --> 47:56.800
by exploiting
the vices of others.

47:58.100 --> 47:59.867
- That's crazy.

47:59.934 --> 48:01.867
- Yeah.

48:01.934 --> 48:03.967
Unfortunately,
we don't have another option.

48:04.033 --> 48:05.734
- You're gonna ask Adebisi
if you can move in with him,

48:05.800 --> 48:06.967
live in his pod?

48:07.033 --> 48:10.033
- I need access
to those videotapes.

48:10.100 --> 48:11.934
- What makes you think
he'll say yes?

48:13.867 --> 48:15.734
- Believe me...

48:16.867 --> 48:19.333
He'll say yes.

48:20.934 --> 48:24.667
- Man, I don't even smoke these.

48:27.567 --> 48:28.967
- What's up, Poet?

48:29.033 --> 48:31.333
- Yo, Leroy,
what's happening, man?

48:31.400 --> 48:33.000
- Nothing.
- Yo, your man, Mondo, man.

48:33.066 --> 48:35.000
That was a wild boy, man.

48:35.066 --> 48:36.600
He got greased.
You okay?

48:36.667 --> 48:38.000
- No, not really.

48:38.066 --> 48:39.266
Hey, give me some of that shit.

48:39.333 --> 48:40.900
- Here, man.

48:43.233 --> 48:44.834
- Hey, it's you and me, Poet.

48:44.900 --> 48:46.367
We gotta cover
each other's backs now.

48:46.433 --> 48:47.667
- Yeah.

48:47.734 --> 48:50.667
'Cause Adebisi is
a crazy motherfucker.

48:50.734 --> 48:52.166
- I'll tell you that, though.

48:52.233 --> 48:54.667
You ain't have to worry
about Adebisi much longer.

48:54.734 --> 48:57.367
- No?
- No, man.

48:57.433 --> 49:01.133
Me and Said,
we're working on an angle.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.333
- For real?
What you up to?

49:03.400 --> 49:05.700
- I can't tell you that.

49:05.767 --> 49:06.734
It's top secret.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.000
- No doubt.
- No doubt.

49:08.066 --> 49:09.033
- I hear that.

49:09.100 --> 49:10.200
Later, blood.

49:10.266 --> 49:11.767
- All right.

49:26.867 --> 49:29.233
- It's what we thought.
- Okay.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.900
- You want me to whack Poet?

49:31.967 --> 49:34.000
- No, not yet.

49:34.066 --> 49:36.467
Don't want them
to know that we know.

49:36.533 --> 49:38.467
- Right.

49:42.900 --> 49:46.000
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

49:46.066 --> 49:49.100
- So, which bunk do you want?

49:51.400 --> 49:53.500
- When was the last time
you were in Emerald City?

49:53.567 --> 49:55.400
- I don't remember.
- Since Querns took over?

49:55.467 --> 49:56.467
- Probably.

49:56.533 --> 49:57.467
- Well,
don't you think it's time

49:57.533 --> 49:58.500
for another fucking visit?

49:58.567 --> 50:00.500
- Watch the way you talk to me!

50:02.066 --> 50:06.367
- Leo, this is not just my ego.

50:06.433 --> 50:09.100
The behavior in there
is illegal, immoral,

50:09.166 --> 50:11.300
and Querns turns a blind eye.

50:11.367 --> 50:12.567
Now,
you gave the man a free hand

50:12.633 --> 50:14.533
because
he kept the violence down,

50:14.600 --> 50:16.700
but two inmates are dead.

50:16.767 --> 50:18.533
You gotta step in.

50:33.233 --> 50:37.367
- You know, I remember
when you first came to Oz.

50:37.433 --> 50:39.734
Jefferson Keane had come
to challenge you.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.233
You got one
of your fellow Muslims

50:41.300 --> 50:44.300
to hit you harder, harder,
until you bled.

50:44.367 --> 50:48.233
I didn't know
what to make of you then.

50:48.300 --> 50:50.000
Still don't now.

50:50.066 --> 50:51.900
- Simon,
the both of us have been

50:51.967 --> 50:53.934
on an extraordinary journey...

50:54.967 --> 50:56.900
And I've tried
to learn from mine,

50:56.967 --> 50:59.934
tried to find the common thing
that binds us all.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.400
- Crime.

51:02.467 --> 51:04.900
Crime is the common theme.

51:04.967 --> 51:08.266
See,
we all of us bad men, even you.

51:09.767 --> 51:12.500
I know
you have come to destroy me.

51:13.600 --> 51:17.867
- Simon,
I don't want to destroy you.

51:17.934 --> 51:19.500
I want to help you change.

51:19.567 --> 51:22.867
- That is what would destroy me.

51:22.934 --> 51:26.200
See, I am who I am,
just as you are.

51:26.266 --> 51:32.066
And I do what I do,
just as you must.

51:32.133 --> 51:34.233
- Does that mean
you're gonna kill me?

51:34.300 --> 51:38.533
Kill you?

51:38.600 --> 51:39.834
I want to kiss you.

51:41.667 --> 51:45.734
But because I admire you
more than I desire you...

51:57.133 --> 52:01.066
This is what you came for.

52:01.133 --> 52:02.734
- Why are you giving this to me?

52:05.633 --> 52:10.066
- Because I have everything.

52:10.133 --> 52:11.967
Everything I need.

52:12.033 --> 52:14.667
Every love satisfied.

52:14.734 --> 52:16.567
It's not enough.

52:18.100 --> 52:19.633
It'll never be enough.

52:19.700 --> 52:22.200
- But like you said,
between the pair of us,

52:22.266 --> 52:24.333
we can do great things
for our people.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.433
- But for what?

52:28.934 --> 52:30.967
We're still in Oz.

52:45.033 --> 52:47.033
- Yeah!

52:49.233 --> 52:51.033
Put it in your mouth!

52:51.100 --> 52:52.367
Oh! Oh!

52:52.433 --> 52:53.900
Shit!

52:53.967 --> 52:57.100
- Turn it off.
I've seen enough.

52:57.166 --> 52:59.066
- Leo...

52:59.133 --> 53:00.200
- What're you gonna say, Querns?

53:00.266 --> 53:01.367
You gonna hand me
a lot of excuses?

53:01.433 --> 53:04.066
You didn't know?
You did know?

53:04.133 --> 53:06.400
It doesn't matter.
You're fired.

53:06.467 --> 53:10.533
Officer, escort Mr. Querns
off the property.

53:10.600 --> 53:12.800
- Let me at least
clean out my office.

53:12.867 --> 53:15.133
- We'll send you
your belongings.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.300
Get out.

53:18.867 --> 53:22.567
- You have yourself
a lovely evening.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.300
- This is all my fucking fault.

53:29.367 --> 53:32.333
Been so caught in the campaign,
I haven't been doing my job.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.367
You want Em City back?

53:37.433 --> 53:39.467
- Let me think it over, yes.

53:48.734 --> 53:51.567
- All right.
Listen up, everybody.

53:51.633 --> 53:53.500
I'm back.

53:53.567 --> 53:56.800
The following are being
transferred out of Em City.

53:56.867 --> 53:59.100
When you hear your name,
pack up your belongings,

53:59.166 --> 54:01.300
line up behind Officer Johnson.

54:01.367 --> 54:04.934
93A234.
Adebisi.

54:06.100 --> 54:09.033
00T255.
Tidd.

54:09.100 --> 54:10.066
- What the fuck?

54:10.133 --> 54:13.700
- 097C332.
Cody.

54:13.767 --> 54:18.800
00W216.
Washington.

54:23.700 --> 54:25.967
- So, the end is here, huh?

54:26.033 --> 54:27.967
- No, more likely,
things are gonna go back

54:28.033 --> 54:29.166
to the way they were before.

54:29.233 --> 54:31.000
- Oh, not for me.

54:31.066 --> 54:32.400
Or for you.

54:32.467 --> 54:33.667
- You said
you weren't gonna kill me!

54:33.734 --> 54:36.233
- You swore to Allah
that you were my brother!

54:36.300 --> 54:37.533
- And I meant that.

54:37.600 --> 54:40.166
- Liar!
Liar.

54:40.233 --> 54:44.133
I gave you that tape
as a final test of your loyalty.

54:44.200 --> 54:45.467
Your friendship!

54:45.533 --> 54:47.033
Your love.

54:47.100 --> 54:49.500
- Oh, God!

54:49.567 --> 54:51.734
- This is how I'm gonna die.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.834
- No!
No!

54:53.900 --> 54:56.467
- Oh, yes, yes!

55:34.600 --> 55:35.633
all: Whoa!

55:37.567 --> 55:39.633
- Twenty-five, we got a 16.

55:52.734 --> 55:55.533
Drop it.
Drop it.

55:55.600 --> 55:57.633
Drop the shank!

56:10.400 --> 56:12.467
- Fuck.
