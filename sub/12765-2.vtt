WEBVTT

00:02.610 --> 00:04.650
It's a text from Amanda.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.340
Latnok. They have her.

00:08.350 --> 00:10.790
- You're leaving with Sarah tonight?
- Yeah.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.730
It's good to travel light.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.570
I think there's
something wrong with Kyle.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.950
He's in trouble. I can't leave.

00:24.140 --> 00:29.250
I don't know with me or with what we're
supposed to be or not be, but it's in your hands.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.100
I think that means that
we shouldn't be together.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.570
What you need is a hot
and sweaty mack session.

00:33.580 --> 00:34.310
With who?

00:34.330 --> 00:36.980
Who cares? Just rebound.

00:39.410 --> 00:40.660
Oh, my god.

00:40.670 --> 00:41.950
No. No.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.210
No, that's OK. Go back
to your bathroom fiesta.

00:45.220 --> 00:46.370
Lori!

00:46.380 --> 00:49.140
My prom night's turning out
to be a G-rated experience.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.490
You were hoping for an R?

00:50.500 --> 00:51.980
You're the one who didn't want to.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.980
You didn't want to, either.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.580
It'll happen when it's right.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.100
When everything comes together in the
moment, we'll feel it. We'll just know.

01:01.090 --> 01:02.990
Sarah?

01:05.860 --> 01:08.060
That spiked punch must have
really done a number on me.

01:08.090 --> 01:09.720
You'll feel better in the morning.

01:09.730 --> 01:12.520
I want to thank you, Kyle.
My night was perfect.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.710
Sweet dreams.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.400
You took Amanda!

01:17.420 --> 01:18.680
She won't remember a thing.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.380
Don't you ever go near her again!

01:20.400 --> 01:21.610
We're not the enemy, Kyle.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.170
We just want to know you, work with you.

01:24.190 --> 01:25.840
I'll never be part of this.

01:25.850 --> 01:27.940
See you around.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.690
37 dollars and 26 cents.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.640
That's it? I worked a double today.

01:35.650 --> 01:38.970
Eight hours minus lunch and two
breaks, that's $5.32 an hour.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.990
I need to get a new job.

01:43.590 --> 01:45.310
I've got to clean up the
back and then we can go.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.550
OK.

01:51.260 --> 01:53.760
Are you all right?

01:55.920 --> 01:58.190
Amanda?

01:59.580 --> 02:01.410
Kyle?

02:01.420 --> 02:03.930
How'd you get by me?

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.010 --> 02:22.150
Amanda, wait!

02:28.280 --> 02:29.710
Kyle, help!

02:29.720 --> 02:32.000
- Amanda!
- Kyle!

02:36.570 --> 02:38.700
It's too late.

02:53.020 --> 02:56.000
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 2:
Psychic Friend</font>

02:57.920 --> 02:59.990
I felt like it was really happening.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.820
It's anxiety.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.660
Latnok really put you
through the wringer.

03:03.690 --> 03:08.010
And even though she was never in any real jeopardy,
you still experienced the trauma of losing her.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.120
I still can't get over
what they did to you.

03:10.130 --> 03:13.360
Listen, Kyle, could you ask
Jessi to have Sarah call me?

03:13.380 --> 03:16.910
I've left her a dozen messages and I want
to talk to her about this Latnok thing.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.550
I've been trying to meet
up with her all week.

03:18.570 --> 03:20.490
I want to see her before they leave.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.870
I hope they're OK.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.000
This can't be easy.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.590
Let's face it. Sarah
does sound a little weird.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.870
Latnok put her through
a lot in her life.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.800
And she was right about them.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.600
They didn't even listen when Adam
Baylin told them to stay away.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.670
You think they'll listen to you?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.710
I don't know.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.840
I guess that's why I'm
having the nightmares.

03:38.850 --> 03:42.670
Maybe Foss could take
care of it, ZZYZX style.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.570
I knew never told him.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.590
You're implying I'm not
man enough to handle it?

03:46.600 --> 03:48.690
That stings a little, Stephen.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.110
You're kidding me, right?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.460
Kyle, you ready for some
summer street fair fun?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.870
Josh Trager bus is leaving in five.

03:57.890 --> 04:00.590
The Josh Trager bus still
needs a new fuel pump.

04:01.380 --> 04:04.150
Right. The actual bus, then.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.210
- Good day, parents.
- Good day.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.540
What is up with him?

04:10.560 --> 04:11.340
No idea.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.320
A total disaster. Best friend
making out with ex-boyfriend.

04:15.710 --> 04:17.050
What did they say about it?

04:17.070 --> 04:19.839
Nothing. I've been dodging
both of them all week.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.970
So, um, how many songs
have you written about it?

04:24.980 --> 04:27.990
Nine. That's why I called you.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.280
That's why you called me?

04:31.310 --> 04:34.610
To exploit me for my musical genius?

04:34.620 --> 04:37.470
Yeah. I mean, that's OK, 
right, exploiting you?

04:37.480 --> 04:41.800
Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought maybe
you, uh, you called for another reason.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.760
Like what?

04:43.770 --> 04:47.950
Like uh... Maybe you
wanted to hang out with me.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.710
What would make you that.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.310
Well, I don't know. Because
I'm smart, I'm clever.

04:53.330 --> 04:57.720
And I'm intuitive. And you're blushing.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.080
- I'm so not blushing.
- Totally blushing.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.710
Crap. Are you going
to make me ask you out?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.850
Uh, depends. Do you want to?

05:04.860 --> 05:08.590
No. I was kind of hoping for the
traditional gender roles here.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.780
Oh, the guy asks the girl out.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.040
- The girl plays hard to get.
- Something like that.

05:13.050 --> 05:18.000
How about this? The guy asks the daughter
of his boss and the boss kicks the guy's ass.

05:19.390 --> 05:21.050
You're afraid of my dad.

05:21.080 --> 05:25.490
Well, your dad technically holds
the keys to my future in his hand.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.120
But I could ask him, you know, first.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.500
You would do that?

05:31.520 --> 05:34.350
I mean, if we're being traditional...

05:35.510 --> 05:37.320
OK, no, yeah, all right. It's settled.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.600
Operation Date With
Lori Trager is in effect.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.510
Hey, Amanda, it's me.

05:44.530 --> 05:47.760
I think I'm in the right
spot, but you're not here.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.860
Just give me a call when you get this.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.550
Sorry I'm late. I got a late start
this morning. I wasn't feeling well.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.570
I came to talk to your mom.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.090
She hasn't been returning my calls.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.010
Maybe she doesn't want to talk to you.

06:47.030 --> 06:48.020
Why wouldn't she?

06:48.030 --> 06:50.910
I don't know. She's not
really a talkative person.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.410
You know, she keeps to herself a lot.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.900
I understand. Still, this is important.

06:56.910 --> 06:59.230
She's not here.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.490
I'm happy to wait. May I come in?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.100
It's probably not a good idea.

07:04.110 --> 07:06.080
Jessi, is everything OK?

07:06.090 --> 07:08.330
Yeah, never better.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.810
I know this is a difficult transition.

07:11.830 --> 07:15.540
I don't think you know anything,
Nicole. I think you should go.

07:15.550 --> 07:19.850
Jessi, I'm coming inside.

07:21.790 --> 07:24.370
Suit yourself.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.120
Please don't tell Kyle.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.160
You feeling OK?

08:11.170 --> 08:12.950
It's this stupid headache
I've had all week.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.500
It's the world's longest
spiked punch hangover.

08:15.510 --> 08:17.930
Let's get you some water.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.020
You think they can tell?

08:19.040 --> 08:21.880
- Tell what?
- Tell that... you know.

08:21.890 --> 08:23.900
That you're a man now?

08:23.910 --> 08:25.800
When you say it like
that it sounds stupid.

08:25.810 --> 08:27.140
It is stupid.

08:27.150 --> 08:30.430
A girl's considered a woman
when she gets her period.

08:31.820 --> 08:34.450
Real nice. Real manly.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.580
I just wonder if anyone
can tell the difference.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.159
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

08:38.179 --> 08:40.580
- I said I wouldn't.
- Good. Don't.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.490
Did either of you
drink the punch at prom?

08:44.520 --> 08:48.660
I share enough germs with this
one. No need to take on more.

08:49.130 --> 08:52.410
They had already confiscated it when I
heard the good news about it being spiked.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.810
I don't know what was in it,
but it really messed me up.

08:54.850 --> 08:57.690
I can't remember anything
about the end of the night.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.450
I really hope I didn't embarrass
myself at the after party.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.280
You weren't at the after party.

09:02.850 --> 09:05.090
We were there, weren't we?

09:05.540 --> 09:08.680
- Of course you were. Andy just didn't see you.
- But I...

09:08.690 --> 09:11.320
Nothing embarrassing other
than being passed out.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.020
Well, look, a psychic. Come on, honey.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.490
Honey?

09:19.280 --> 09:21.500
Is there something I should know?

09:21.510 --> 09:25.110
No. Nothing.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.800
You're keeping a secret.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.210
Apparently, more than one.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.430
I'm just helping Kyle
out with a problem.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.110
A lying to your girlfriend
about where you were on prom night problem?

09:38.190 --> 09:39.220
It's a long story.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.770
Which you were going to tell me when?

09:40.780 --> 09:43.150
Never. A man is bound by his honor.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.780
Oh, for the love of God!

09:47.150 --> 09:48.690
Did you want me to continue?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.340
Yes, please.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.170
Let's move on from all the secret stuff.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.030
You'll come into a sudden windfall.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.410
Maybe you can go buy yourself
some more honor, honey.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.230
Amanda?

10:10.770 --> 10:12.780
- Amanda!
- What?

10:14.090 --> 10:17.070
- Where were you? I didn't see you.
- I went to find a garbage can.

10:17.670 --> 10:19.010
What's going on?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.170
- I thought I lost you for a second.
- You're obviliously on edge.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.460
- There's something you're not telling me.
- Amanda, I...

10:23.470 --> 10:26.900
Is it about the after party because
Josh and Andy were being weird.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.800
Did something happen?

10:31.170 --> 10:34.000
You have to tell me the truth!

10:34.950 --> 10:39.050
I came out of the school after
getting your bag and you weren't there.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.120
You were just gone.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.250
I was scared. I thought
something had happened.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.010
- I don't remember any of this.
- I know.

10:49.470 --> 10:50.790
What then?

10:50.820 --> 10:53.530
I looked everywhere for you.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.980
When I finally found you, 
you were asleep, out cold.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.850
Where?

10:58.870 --> 11:01.310
A ways away from the school.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.480
I wandered off and passed out?

11:04.500 --> 11:07.080
When I found you, you were fine.

11:07.510 --> 11:09.330
So, we never actually
went to the after party?

11:09.350 --> 11:11.690
I took you home and you
didn't remember anything.

11:11.710 --> 11:12.900
You didn't say anything?

11:12.920 --> 11:14.640
- Your mother was there.
- You let me believe that I just...

11:14.650 --> 11:18.330
- Amanda, I'm sorry.
- You lied to me!

11:18.340 --> 11:21.210
I didn't want to ruin
your perfect night.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.550
You just did.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.830
Your turn.

11:32.550 --> 11:34.480
- OK, so...
- We should go.

11:34.490 --> 11:35.550
No.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.090
- Amanda...
- I don't feel like going anywhere with you right now!

11:41.580 --> 11:44.080
Maybe you guys should
check out the psychic.

11:44.390 --> 11:46.390
Yeah. Yeah, she's really great.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.920
You guys should totally check her out.

11:51.660 --> 11:55.380
You should, because I'm going home now.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.090
Put your money on the table.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.330
You don't want to be here.

12:11.650 --> 12:12.910
No.

12:12.950 --> 12:14.410
So, you don't believe?

12:14.430 --> 12:20.420
It's scientifi to predict a future action without
having complete knowledge of all the variables.

12:20.430 --> 12:24.090
Perhaps, if you're only
looking at it scientifically.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.500
How else can I look at it?

12:31.510 --> 12:36.240
Faith. Fate. Intuition.

12:37.220 --> 12:41.050
Haven't you ever felt certain you
knew something was going to happen?

12:41.060 --> 12:43.320
I've sensed things.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.170
There's always been an explanation.

12:46.190 --> 12:50.500
A change in the weather, pattern of
behaviors with a predictable outcome.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.190
What about a gut feeling?

12:53.200 --> 12:57.060
Perhaps a dream? A nightmare?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.280
You're afraid.

13:16.310 --> 13:19.260
But it's not for yourself.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.940
You know there's no
one who can hurt you.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.140
The only way to get to you
is through those you love.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.400
There is a girl.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.900
Your soul mate.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.080
But you've missed the signs.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.370
What signs?

13:44.390 --> 13:49.680
I see something white
and water. It's swimming.

13:51.810 --> 13:52.810
Rabbit.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.050
Rabbits don't swim.

13:54.070 --> 13:55.520
The white rabbit will swim.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.790
I don't understand.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.840
How? When?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.550
Tonight.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.100
Be ready. Your soul mate is in danger.

14:14.940 --> 14:16.560
Could you tell if she was lying?

14:16.570 --> 14:17.290
I don't know.

14:17.300 --> 14:21.430
Her heart rate was all over the place, but
that could have just been from the trance.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.170
Well, you have to understand, 
empaths, the best ones, 

14:24.190 --> 14:26.780
are usually just picking up on
the cues from their subjects.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
Your anxiety must have
been pouring out of you.

14:28.820 --> 14:31.290
And she exploited it. She's
a two-bit carnival hack.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.110
But she knew about Amanda.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.320
It's a con. She was deliberately vague.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.750
Why would someone do that?

14:36.760 --> 14:37.990
It's an unfortunate reality.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.630
People prey on the innocent.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.710
If you ask me, they're all a bunch
of crazies looking to make a buck.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.270
Again with the eavesdropping.

14:44.290 --> 14:46.160
The sound carries.

14:46.190 --> 14:48.180
What did she say to you?

14:48.200 --> 14:53.530
She said I have a secret.
Windfall. A secret windfall coming.

14:53.540 --> 14:56.200
Speaking of windfalls, you owe
me 20 bucks for your fuel pump.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.780
You're robbing me of my last bill, sir.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.090
Somehow I think you'll survive.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.890
Sweet. Another 20.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.830
Must have missed it
when I counted my tips.

15:08.850 --> 15:10.700
A windfall.

15:11.150 --> 15:13.460
Dude, 20 dollars is hardly the lottery.

15:13.470 --> 15:15.690
I gotta go.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.780
Hey, it...

15:28.060 --> 15:29.380
Make mine a double.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.890
What's the matter with you?

15:30.910 --> 15:32.910
Unresolved friend drama.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.300
You?

15:34.330 --> 15:36.470
Boyfriend problems.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.000
Do you think I'm too innocent?

15:40.020 --> 15:42.160
Is this a trick question?

15:42.180 --> 15:43.920
Kyle treats me like I'm a child.

15:43.940 --> 15:47.050
I'm this fragile thing
that needs protecting.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.410
Number 27.

15:49.430 --> 15:50.260
Number 27?

15:50.270 --> 15:53.440
I can break down relationship
troubles into 42 parts.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.890
The higher the number, 
the worse the problem.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.210
What's number 42?

15:57.230 --> 15:59.180
Devastating breakup.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.420
And number 27 is
overprotective boyfriend?

16:01.430 --> 16:05.050
Followed shortly after by
woman exerting independence.

16:05.650 --> 16:06.920
What's wrong with that?

16:06.960 --> 16:10.980
Absolutely nothing. If you're the woman.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.100
- Hey, man.
- Is Amanda here?

16:16.110 --> 16:20.320
Out back, talking to Hillary, the
source of many of my current problems.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.830
Great.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.440
Would you like me to play
wingwoman or should I skedaddle?

16:32.460 --> 16:34.280
Do you want to do something tonight?

16:34.290 --> 16:35.600
You mean like a girl date?

16:35.610 --> 16:38.070
I just... I need a break
from Kyle for the night.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.170
Number 28, woman exerting independence.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.360
Absolutely.

16:41.390 --> 16:44.190
I have these tickets to this great
band playing at the street fair.

16:44.210 --> 16:46.220
I was gonna ask Lori and Declan, but...

16:46.240 --> 16:50.510
Actually, I was thinking, stay in, eat some
chocolate, wallow our way through The Notebook.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.570
That could be fun, too.

16:53.590 --> 16:54.910
Lori still not talking to you?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.250
Neither is Hillary.

16:56.280 --> 17:01.020
Apparently, kissing your ex's friend is a major
violation of something called "the girl code."

17:01.040 --> 17:02.380
There's a girl code?

17:02.390 --> 17:04.060
It was news to me, too.

17:04.069 --> 17:05.540
I need to talk to Amanda.

17:05.550 --> 17:08.490
May you have better luck
with the female persuasion.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.390
Just give me a minute.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.760
Stay strong.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.599
Hey, Hils.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.109
You need to keep your
distance. I can't be seen

17:27.119 --> 17:29.650
This is ridiculous. I was drunk.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.500
Why can't we all
pretend it didn't happen?

17:31.530 --> 17:33.500
Because it did happen!

17:33.520 --> 17:35.920
And now my best friend
isn't speaking to me.

17:35.940 --> 17:39.050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's some
weird violation of the girl rule.

17:39.060 --> 17:40.210
Code.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.310
Whatever. But you and I are friends.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.550
You helped me through
everything with Lori.

17:45.570 --> 17:48.130
Don't bail on me now.

17:48.870 --> 17:51.220
You have got to be kidding me.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.030
Trager, come on.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.140
Come on, what? Choose
a guy over your friend?

17:54.150 --> 17:55.600
That's not what happened.

17:55.620 --> 17:56.930
Lori, it wasn't her fault.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.450
Are you sure, because she
has a history with the boys.

18:00.850 --> 18:02.320
I can't believe you just went there.

18:02.340 --> 18:05.060
Well, that makes two of us.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.370
I want to talk to you.

18:12.390 --> 18:13.630
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.650
Amanda, I understand that
you're upset and I'm sorry.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.360
Look, I just need some time to think.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.490
A night off.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.130
Kyle, I'm not asking for your permission.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.050
I think I really blew it.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.780
Amanda's mad at me.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.990
Well, that's a first.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.540
She doesn't want me, I don't
want to let her out of my sight.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.960
Do I need to give you a lecture
on the perils of stalking?

18:47.470 --> 18:50.000
I have a terrible feeling something
bad is going to happen to her.

18:50.030 --> 18:53.260
Earlier I think I saw that guy from
Latnok, the one that kidnapped Amanda.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.690
And then a psychic told me
my soul mate was in danger.

18:55.710 --> 18:57.990
The one from the street fair?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.770
I saw her yesterday as a joke.

18:59.790 --> 19:03.020
She didn't make any sense. She just
kept babbling about...

19:04.090 --> 19:05.890
- What?
- Nothing.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.470
Declan, what?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.890
She told me I'd be caught
between enemy lines.

19:11.210 --> 19:14.610
Which didn't make any
sense until just now.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.360
Hello?

19:19.270 --> 19:21.550
Sarah?

19:24.640 --> 19:25.750
You're back.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.460
I told the landlord I'd
locked my keys inside.

19:28.470 --> 19:31.860
Thankfully, he'd never met Sarah
and he just assumed I was her.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.380
What are you doing?

19:35.540 --> 19:37.280
I want you to come home with me.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.170
- I already said...
- I know.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.360
And I'm not gonna force you.

19:42.620 --> 19:46.010
But Jessi, I've counseled a lot
of teenagers over the years.

19:46.020 --> 19:49.500
And I've seen them through
some terrible situations.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.140
Some of them I've been able to help.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.810
Some of them I haven't.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.920
I have never given up on any of them.

19:57.180 --> 20:00.240
And I'm not giving up on you.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.450
- Everybody else did.
- No.

20:03.020 --> 20:06.410
Sarah did. Just Sarah.

20:06.420 --> 20:11.510
And the first thing that you and I are gonna work on
is a way for you to understand that's not your fault.

20:13.800 --> 20:18.500
But in order for that to happen, 
you're gonna have to come with me.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.610
You're gonna have to trust me.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.250
Does Kyle know about Sarah?

20:31.260 --> 20:33.220
Not yet, but he should.

20:42.050 --> 20:45.770
OK. I just need some time to pack.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.840
OK.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.720
Amanda!

20:53.730 --> 20:55.150
What are you doing here?

20:55.170 --> 20:57.830
I've been acting strange
and keeping things from you.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.210
But I'm truly sorry.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.630
I'm not in the mood to discuss it.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.040
So, let's talk about it tonight.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.950
Cancel your plans and stay in with me.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.490
I can't just cancel my plans.

21:05.510 --> 21:07.650
Please, Amanda, just spend
tonight with me instead.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.790
Why? Why is tonight so important?

21:11.470 --> 21:13.910
I'm worried that something
might happen to you.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.820
One visit to the psychic and
now you can predict the future?

21:16.830 --> 21:18.620
She said that...

21:18.630 --> 21:22.670
Wait a minute. Is this
actually about the psychic?

21:23.280 --> 21:26.720
She said that tonight, when the white
rabbit swims, my soul mate will be in danger.

21:26.740 --> 21:29.680
Kyle, come on. Really.

21:32.530 --> 21:34.680
You're so trusting of everyone.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.820
You can't let that
scam artist get to you.

21:36.850 --> 21:40.380
You don't need to
protect me. I'll be fine.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.020
The psychic had warned
me of bad things to come.

21:58.070 --> 22:01.350
Was it possible for
someone to see danger?

22:04.780 --> 22:08.350
Had my nightmare been a way of
predicting trouble for Amanda?

22:13.250 --> 22:17.670
I needed to understand the
message, decipher its meaning.

22:33.400 --> 22:38.300
And more than anything, 
to keep Amanda safe.

22:41.380 --> 22:44.040
Even if I needed some help to do it.

22:46.810 --> 22:50.940
The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, 
The Princess Diaries.

22:50.950 --> 22:52.720
I'm sensing a theme here.

22:52.740 --> 22:54.370
What do you mean?

22:54.380 --> 22:55.860
Never mind.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.410
Let girls' night commence.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.630
What the hell is she doing here?

23:05.090 --> 23:09.010
Tuesday's pasta, Thursday's pot roast.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.980
Where's Monday's chicken?

23:14.640 --> 23:17.700
I think it's sprouted
wings and flown the coop.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.040
All right. I'll cook.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.190
You'll what?

23:24.210 --> 23:27.060
Don't sound so surprised.
Any moron can boil a noodle.

23:27.750 --> 23:31.450
Well, it's just so grown
up of you to offer.

23:31.460 --> 23:34.320
Face the facts, Stephen, I'm growing up.

23:35.010 --> 23:39.510
OK. First of all, Stephen is my name only
to people your mother did not give birth to.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.540
- Secondly, what the hell's going on with you?
- Nothing.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.320
Nothing?

23:44.340 --> 23:46.040
You're acting like
you've been body swapped.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.700
So, you're either up to something or...

23:51.150 --> 23:54.010
My god. You're having sex.

23:54.020 --> 23:54.850
What?

23:54.870 --> 23:57.500
You're having sex. I can't believe I
didn't see the signs. I'm such an idiot.

23:57.510 --> 23:59.420
- Dad, I was...
- You said it didn't happen.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.140
- Well, actually...
- I believed you

24:01.150 --> 24:03.140
I didn't think you could keep
something like that from me.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.710
Andy didn't want anybody to...

24:04.730 --> 24:09.020
I trusted you, Josh. Damnit!

24:15.020 --> 24:16.440
Hey, Mr. Trager.

24:16.470 --> 24:17.420
Mark, did we have a meeting?

24:17.430 --> 24:20.750
No, actually. I came
by... I wanted to, uh...

24:20.760 --> 24:23.440
I wanted to talk to
you about your daughter.

24:23.450 --> 24:27.430
Oh, I feel for you, Mark, because if you're
standing on my doorstep at this moment, 

24:27.470 --> 24:29.100
about to ask permission
to date my daughter, 

24:29.110 --> 24:31.960
then you possibly have the worst
timing in the history of the universe, 

24:31.980 --> 24:37.500
so I'm gonna say no, one hundred percent, 
absolutely not, over my dead body, no. Got it?

24:37.510 --> 24:39.740
- I just wanted...
- Good.

24:45.890 --> 24:50.030
- Oh, good. I'm almost ready. I just need...
- Jessi. I need your help.

24:50.040 --> 24:50.830
My help?

24:50.840 --> 24:52.350
Amanda's at her house with the girls.

24:52.370 --> 24:55.060
I need you to go over
there and watch out for her.

24:55.070 --> 24:57.550
You want me to help you with Amanda?

24:57.570 --> 25:01.620
I know it's a lot to ask, but I have a feeling
something bad is going to happen tonight

25:01.630 --> 25:04.870
and you're the only one that
can protect her like I can.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.610
Please, Jessi. I need you.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.060
Yeah, sure.

25:13.350 --> 25:17.190
Great. I'll text Lori and
have her tell Amanda she invited you over.

25:18.740 --> 25:20.650
You OK? You seem like something's wrong.

25:20.660 --> 25:24.300
No, no, I'll take care of it.

25:25.630 --> 25:27.940
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you guys were in a fight.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.790
I swear I didn't plan this.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.880
I think I'm gonna go.

25:33.890 --> 25:35.860
So soon?

25:40.280 --> 25:42.240
- Great.
- What?

25:43.980 --> 25:44.540
Hi.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.250
I forgot to tell you Jessi was coming.

25:53.740 --> 25:56.730
- Nicole, thank God you're home.
- What's the matter?

25:56.740 --> 25:59.970
While you were out saving a
teenager I've lost control of ours.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.400
Hey, how did everything go with Jessi?

26:03.410 --> 26:06.440
Great. I asked her to watch
over Amanda for me tonight.

26:07.090 --> 26:10.730
She needed to talk to you about
something. She didn't mention it?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.930
I guess I didn't give her the chance.

26:13.940 --> 26:18.470
Oh no... oh Kyle...

26:20.840 --> 26:22.000
Is she your new best friend now?

26:22.020 --> 26:26.160
Because if memory serves, she made out
with Declan too, and then bitch slapped you.

26:26.180 --> 26:29.210
For some reason thing didn't sting
as bad as what you did.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.490
I didn't do anything.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.760
What?

26:39.770 --> 26:41.530
Jessi, I'm so sorry.

26:41.540 --> 26:43.100
For what?

26:43.110 --> 26:45.340
You got what you wanted.
Isn't that all that matters?

26:45.350 --> 26:47.250
You know that's not true.

26:47.260 --> 26:49.170
I should have noticed
that you needed me.

26:49.200 --> 26:53.920
Look, I'm doing what you asked. I'm watching
over your precious girlfriend.

26:54.350 --> 26:56.380
I promise I'll make this right.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.810
Don't bother.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.400
Hillary, do you still have
tickets for that band?

27:07.410 --> 27:09.160
- Why?
- Because we're going.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.830
- Hallelujah.
- What's going on?

27:10.840 --> 27:13.200
I'm not gonna stay in my
own house and get spied on.

27:13.210 --> 27:15.270
I wasn't spying, I was watching.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.810
There's a difference.

27:16.830 --> 27:19.430
Not to me, there isn't. Let's go.

27:20.230 --> 27:21.820
Is she going?

27:21.830 --> 27:23.290
Not if you are.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.950
You know what? I needed night. I needed
a night off from Kyle with you two.

27:27.250 --> 27:30.050
I'm gonna go alone if I have to.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.100
You're not coming.

27:32.130 --> 27:35.130
You can tell Kyle I'm off
putting myself in danger.

27:40.690 --> 27:43.810
I have to go, don't I? For Kyle.

27:44.700 --> 27:47.230
Lovely.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.140
Hi

27:56.700 --> 27:59.140
You've got a problem.

28:09.490 --> 28:11.920
- I'm in trouble.
- Wow, that bad?

28:11.930 --> 28:14.810
I really messed things up
with Amanda, and now Jessi.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.470
Do I want to know what you did?

28:16.500 --> 28:17.710
Everything wrong.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.030
That makes two of us.

28:19.050 --> 28:21.140
They're going to see a band
play but I don't know where.

28:21.160 --> 28:21.910
Did you called Lori?

28:21.930 --> 28:23.900
Tried but her phone went to voicemail.

28:23.930 --> 28:25.860
Try again.

28:31.190 --> 28:33.020
Let me guess. Kyle?

28:33.380 --> 28:36.390
No, it's Mark, actually. I'm just gonna...

28:36.400 --> 28:37.690
Hi, Mark.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.580
Just tell me where you're
going. That's all I need to know.

28:39.590 --> 28:43.280
I'm just on my way to see
Faber Drive play. Where are you?

28:43.290 --> 28:44.800
Thanks.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.740
OK, great. It was great to talking to you, too. Bye.

28:47.750 --> 28:49.440
Lori?

28:51.660 --> 28:53.710
Mark.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.120
I'm really sorry.

29:00.970 --> 29:03.550
Uh, I was gonna call you tonight.

29:03.570 --> 29:05.800
Sort of wishing you just had.

29:05.820 --> 29:07.710
I talked to your dad.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.440
To say that it went horribly
would be a massive understatement.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.020
Talked to her dad about what?

29:12.040 --> 29:14.550
None of your business.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.530
Unbelievable.

29:16.550 --> 29:21.100
You're giving me all this crap about Declan
and you're busy lining up the DJ on the side?

29:21.130 --> 29:23.000
The best friend, I presume.

29:23.010 --> 29:26.410
You know what, Lori? You're a hypocrite.

29:28.010 --> 29:31.480
- I'm having a bad night.
- We can talk later. Where you guys headed?

29:31.490 --> 29:34.250
To see Faber Drive play.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.610
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

29:40.730 --> 29:43.250
Where are they all running off to?

29:44.020 --> 29:45.670
Faber Drive's playing.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.540
Sounds like fun. Maybe
I'll go check it out.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.780
Look, I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

29:54.790 --> 29:57.320
But you know if she catches you following
her, she'll hate you.

29:57.350 --> 29:59.270
What if something
happens and I'm not there?

29:59.290 --> 30:03.220
Then you have to ask yourself how much you really 
believe in the prediction of a street fair psychic.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.880
What if I told you I
could predict the future?

30:05.900 --> 30:09.230
I've learned from experience never to
doubt when you say you can do something.

30:09.250 --> 30:12.400
So, what if, no matter how crazy
it seems, the psychic is right?

30:12.430 --> 30:16.190
What if Amanda really is in danger and
I don't do everything I can to stop it?

30:16.660 --> 30:17.930
What do you want to do?

30:17.950 --> 30:20.800
I want to go to the Faber Drive show
and watch over her. Just in case.

30:20.810 --> 30:24.070
Wait. They're going to Faber Drive?

30:24.080 --> 30:26.580
- Yes.
- Man, we gotta go.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.410
What's the matter?

30:28.420 --> 30:31.210
- The psychic, she saw water in her prediction?
- Yes.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.250
Well, that band, they're
playing on a boat.

30:46.780 --> 30:51.780
Here you are. Kyle?
Put it out of your head.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.280
We're gonna have fun, right?

30:53.310 --> 30:55.270
How could it be anything but?

30:56.690 --> 30:58.330
Great. My headache's back.

30:58.340 --> 31:00.720
It's not too late to go home.

31:01.370 --> 31:04.260
No, I'm gonna do this.

31:07.810 --> 31:10.900
So, the psychic was right.
My secret wasn't safe.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.670
I knew it. You couldn't help yourself.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.380
You had to blab to the
heavens you got laid.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.610
I didn't blab to anyone.
My dad figured it out.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.360
Your dad? Your parents know?

31:19.370 --> 31:21.400
Well, usually where one
knows, the other follows.

31:21.430 --> 31:22.670
Josh, this is a disaster.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.420
For me, yes. Why are you so pissed?

31:24.430 --> 31:28.680
Every time your parents look at me they'll
see the girl who's having sex with their son.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.430
What if they tell my
moms? They'll freak!

31:31.440 --> 31:33.040
This doesn't have to be the end of the world.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.180
No, but it's the end of our sex life.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.880
What? Why?

31:38.180 --> 31:40.910
It's just... I'm not ready for
people to look at me like that.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.730
Like what?

31:41.750 --> 31:43.570
Like a walking statistic.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.220
Like a possible Juno in the making.

31:45.230 --> 31:49.230
Like every other idiot girl who gives it
up too early and has to suffer consequences.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.470
That's not gonna be me. I'm sorry.

31:51.480 --> 31:56.620
I really am, but it, the sex, is done.

32:08.980 --> 32:11.120
There you guys are. I'm
glad I caught up with you.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.410
Good. You made it. Need a ticket?

32:15.490 --> 32:16.900
I can't believe you just did that.

32:16.940 --> 32:20.780
And I can't believe you refuse to speak to
me over something that doesn't matter to you.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.890
What doesn't matter? That Declan
kissed you or that you let him?

32:23.900 --> 32:24.910
I didn't let him.

32:24.930 --> 32:27.060
I know what I saw. You liked it.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.200
All right, fine. I liked it. Happy?

32:30.210 --> 32:33.520
You dumped him. You decided he wasn't
good enough for all your "woe is me, 

32:33.530 --> 32:35.550
I need to find myself without you" crap.

32:35.570 --> 32:37.320
- That's not crap.
- Face it, Lori.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.290
You had a good guy and you blew it.

32:39.310 --> 32:40.450
This whole thing's your fault.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.020
- It's not my fault.
- Get off of me!

32:45.230 --> 32:47.670
Serves you right.

32:47.790 --> 32:50.090
Oh, I hope that doesn't stain.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.140
You so did not just do that.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.240
Oh, I think I just did.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.520
Lori, where is she? Where's Amanda?

33:02.530 --> 33:05.250
She's in line for the... boat.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.350
White rabbit swims...

33:34.850 --> 33:37.260
Are you two 12?

34:31.469 --> 34:32.520
You followed me here?

34:32.540 --> 34:34.520
Don't flatter yourself.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.699
You just happened to be
at a party by yourself?

34:37.710 --> 34:40.070
Aren't you?

34:48.030 --> 34:49.969
Amanda!

35:20.260 --> 35:22.490
Jessi!

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.920
You feeling OK?

35:40.930 --> 35:43.330
I should have seen that beam coming.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.910
Guess I was distracted.

35:46.910 --> 35:49.490
With good reason.

35:50.300 --> 35:53.180
I'm sorry, Jessi. I've
been a terrible friend.

35:53.190 --> 35:54.460
You didn't know.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.340
But I should have.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.670
You're always saying
that we're the same.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.030
I should have picked up on the
fact that you were having problems.

36:03.080 --> 36:06.290
You're right. You should have.

36:10.380 --> 36:13.160
But I shouldn't have
kept them from you, either.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.800
- Sarah just left?
- Yep.

36:22.210 --> 36:24.850
I would never do that to you.

36:24.860 --> 36:27.520
You know that, right?

36:27.960 --> 36:30.430
I know that.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.090
Why did you go after Amanda tonight?

36:39.630 --> 36:45.340
You asked me to look after her for
you, and I didn't want to let you down.

36:55.730 --> 36:57.750
Does it hurt?

37:00.050 --> 37:02.690
A little.

37:21.410 --> 37:25.020
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.670
Your girlfriend's waiting
for you. You should go.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.900
She's mad at me.

37:47.270 --> 37:49.510
She'll get over it.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.220
No one can stay mad at you.

37:54.890 --> 37:56.160
I'll be right there.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.610
I have to pick up Kyle and Jessi.

37:59.060 --> 38:00.300
I'll stay here with Josh.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.150
Great, so you can yell at me some more?

38:02.160 --> 38:05.810
I love you. We'll talk later.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.080
Sit.

38:13.070 --> 38:16.580
OK, before you say anything, I
have to tell you that I'm sorry.

38:17.190 --> 38:19.740
- You are?
- Yeah.

38:19.750 --> 38:24.270
When I gave you the condom I knew I
was putting the choice in your hands.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.200
I'm not upset that you had sex.

38:29.270 --> 38:32.150
I mean, I'm a little upset.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.370
But I'm mostly disappointed that you didn't
feel like you could talk to me about it.

38:36.750 --> 38:38.520
Dad, come on, it's embarrassing.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.650
It shouldn't be embarrassing, Josh.
It can be a great thing when it's right.

38:41.660 --> 38:45.250
But I don't want you to feel like
you have to handle this alone.

38:45.910 --> 38:48.780
Apparently, Andy was the
one who couldn't handle it.

38:48.790 --> 38:49.940
She's cut me off.

38:49.950 --> 38:54.760
She has? I mean, she has?

38:54.770 --> 38:56.330
Girls are confusing.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.320
Oh, this is only the beginning.

39:01.370 --> 39:04.950
So, do you feel like you want
to tell me more about it?

39:09.730 --> 39:12.620
Yeah. Sure.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.340
What's next, mud wrestling?

39:27.120 --> 39:28.750
You can't stay mad at her forever.

39:28.770 --> 39:31.130
What, are you choosing sides?

39:31.140 --> 39:35.790
Honestly, Trager, if I'd have known about
this girl code, I never would have done it.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.020
I was just drunk and
feeling sorry for myself.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.350
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

39:41.370 --> 39:44.880
But I did and I'm sorry.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.110
- Are you into her?
- No!

39:50.410 --> 39:53.020
I... I don't know. Maybe.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.900
But it shouldn't matter.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.300
You made the choice to move on.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.390
It's not fair for you to hold me back.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.280
I owe you an apology.

40:15.790 --> 40:18.270
Do you?

40:18.280 --> 40:20.770
The psychic was right.

40:21.910 --> 40:24.590
You were there to save the day.

40:25.260 --> 40:27.520
In spite of everything I
did to make sure you weren't.

40:27.530 --> 40:30.580
But I don't think the
psychic predicted the future.

40:30.590 --> 40:33.400
- I think I created it.
- How?

40:33.410 --> 40:36.280
Everything I did put you on that boat.

40:36.290 --> 40:39.460
If I hadn't made you angry or
had been a better friend to Jessi, 

40:39.500 --> 40:41.830
neither of you would have been there.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.680
But we were.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.730
And it's funny.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.820
What is?

40:53.670 --> 40:56.770
The psychic said your soul
mate would be in danger.

40:57.840 --> 41:03.950
And after all was said and done, 
it wasn't me who needed saving.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.250
It was Jessi.

41:16.050 --> 41:20.070
My mom's here. Good night.

41:41.710 --> 41:43.540
Let's go home.

42:08.200 --> 42:12.850
- Settling your tab?
- Yes. Thanks for all your help.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.170
It was a terrible joke
to play on your friend.

42:17.190 --> 42:19.990
Well, that's why I paid
you a little extra.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.840
I felt him, you know.

42:24.820 --> 42:27.310
That boy, he's special.

42:27.320 --> 42:30.740
Yes, he is.

42:33.980 --> 42:36.280
I see great things in his future.
