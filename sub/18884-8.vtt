have to keep doing this?

15:19.344 --> 15:21.275
I'’m gonna pick Skyler.

15:21.275 --> 15:23.793
Okay, before I pick Skyler--
I mean--make my final decision--

15:23.793 --> 15:26.586
- Yeah, common mistake.
- Why don'’t we play

15:26.586 --> 15:27.689

a little too quickly.

You--

16:01.551 --> 16:03.413
You--I just saw you
orgasm on him.

16:03.413 --> 16:06.793

I should probably admit.

16:06.793 --> 16:07.896
I'’m a virgin.

16:07.896 --> 16:09.482

with a lot of girls,

16:10.620 --> 16:12.068

16:12.068 --> 16:14.517
So I should probably
just kiss Skyler again.

that he goes through.
