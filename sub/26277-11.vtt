00:00.100 --> 00:02.135
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.135 --> 00:04.538
Lourdes is on her way.
I'll go -- I'll go get her.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.039
No. No, no, please.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.207
Stay with me.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.043
As you know,
I study shared consciousness,

00:10.043 --> 00:12.379
like the callings
you've all experienced.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.881
She studies
"shared consciousness"

00:13.881 --> 00:15.282
and just happens
to be on the plane?

00:15.282 --> 00:16.550
Coincidences happen.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.751
So do conspiracies.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.519
Man: I think perhaps
you lost your phone?

00:19.519 --> 00:21.521
No, that's not...

00:21.521 --> 00:23.657
...mine.
It is now.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.592
Why does he get to be
in my house with my children?

00:25.592 --> 00:27.961
You are the whole reason
this family is messed up.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.529
I love you.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.164
It's always been you.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.700
No matter what I do, I'm the bad
guy, and I'm tired of it.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.202
I understand.
I-I'll leave.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.937
No, no, no. I'll --

00:41.074 --> 00:42.910
Saanvi: I think I found
the Major's Holy Grail.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.945
They found that some
of the passengers

00:44.945 --> 00:47.080
are more sensitive
to the callings.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.682
Cal.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.421
No one's blaming you for
what happened to MA 828.

00:54.421 --> 00:55.822
You can't help me.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.805
Miss anything?

01:11.805 --> 01:16.476
Oh, about 300 miles
of glassy ocean.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.911
How's the cargo?

01:17.911 --> 01:21.949
Lady in 5-D wants
a hypoallergenic blanket.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.917
Uh, did anybody point out
that she's breathing

01:23.917 --> 01:26.887
recycled air full of skin cells
and flatulence?

01:26.887 --> 01:30.691
You would make
a horrible flight attendant.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.626
I'm a cowboy, Amuta.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.963
Plane's my horse,
and the sky an open desert.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.439
What the...

01:45.439 --> 01:47.841
Center,
this is MA 828.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.776
We got a bit of
unplanned turbulence up here.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.378
Where the hell did that
come from?

01:51.378 --> 01:53.213
It wasn't on
any of the charts.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.548
It's okay. Every --

01:56.116 --> 01:58.251
Please.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.991
I've never seen anything
like this.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.058
You?
Never.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.469
Get over it. Up!

02:15.469 --> 02:17.170
Up!

02:19.172 --> 02:20.574
No time.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.376
I'm going through it.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.443
You're what?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.781
Accelerating
airspeed to 300 knots.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.950
Are you sure about this?

02:29.950 --> 02:33.186
Maintaining
a level altitude.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.928
Here we go.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.999
I didn't have a choice.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.136
The NTSB report tells
another story.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.704
According
to the ground telemetry,

02:50.704 --> 02:53.440
you made a series
of unconventional maneuvers.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.608
You don't understand.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.809
There is
no "conventional maneuver"

02:55.809 --> 02:57.310
when a storm appears
right on top of you.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.347
And this storm was like
nothing I've ever seen.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.083
Daly, people have been going
over every aspect of this flight

03:03.083 --> 03:05.519
with a microscope
for 5 1/2 years,

03:05.519 --> 03:08.355
looking into everything from
the plane's maintenance reports

03:08.355 --> 03:10.891
to the last place each
of the passengers had dinner.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.226
And the only thing
anyone can find

03:13.226 --> 03:14.895
that's out of the ordinary

03:14.895 --> 03:16.263
is the abrupt moves
you made

03:16.263 --> 03:17.831
right before you flew
into that storm

03:17.831 --> 03:19.266
and your plane
disappeared.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.901
I'm the captain.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.571
Those people put their lives
in my hands.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.407
I take that seriously.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.309
I did
what I had to do.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.632
Cal:
Um, excuse me, mister?

03:52.632 --> 03:55.602
You're the pilot, right?

03:55.602 --> 03:56.937
I sure am.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.673
My dad said sometimes pilots
give kids wings.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.776
You have any wings
I could have?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.845
Sorry, kiddo.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.048
Uh, they just got clipped.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.750
It's okay.
Thanks for bringing us home.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.908
-Best day ever, dad.
-For me, too.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.344
But next time, can we go out
to watch a movie?

04:37.344 --> 04:39.713
The screen at your place
is a little small.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.448
Look, buddy, right now,
we kinda need

04:41.448 --> 04:42.749
to keep a low profile

04:42.749 --> 04:45.819
because some people
are interested in us

04:45.819 --> 04:47.187
because we were on 828,

04:47.187 --> 04:49.389
and they may not be
very nice.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.057
You mean the Major.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.094
How did you know
about that?

04:54.094 --> 04:56.530
I heard you and Auntie Mick
talking about her.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.764
It's fine, Dad.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.866
I know I'm supposed
to stay safe.

04:59.866 --> 05:02.469
There's my Calamander.
I missed you.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.938
Sorry I came in the house.
I wanted to make sure --

05:04.938 --> 05:06.673
Ben, it's -- it's fine.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.809
It's your house, too.
You can come inside.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.478
Mom, Dad got us TV dinners.
It was awesome.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.879
Was it, now?

05:12.879 --> 05:15.081
Salisbury steak --
always a favorite.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.383
I bet.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.351
Do you think you can do it again
tomorrow?

05:18.351 --> 05:21.021
I've got this thing
that's come up at work.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.356
Yeah, sure. Maybe we could try
the turkey dinner.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.092
But Dad can't tomorrow.
He's gonna be busy.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.162
I am?

05:29.162 --> 05:32.065
The man from the plane?
He needs your help.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.736
Man from the plane?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.307
Look, I'm sure
we can work something out.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.043
Worst case scenario,
it's Michaela's day off.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.578
Awesome.
Auntie Mick.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.613
There we go.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.548
Love you, kiddo.
-Olive! Guess what.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.783
I got to have Hungry Man.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.806
Find her.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.009
Find her.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.686
Riojas tells me
you traded shifts.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.888
Yeah, I did.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.957
Mick, why are you
avoiding me?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.061
Come on.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.971
Mick.

06:44.971 --> 06:48.275
This is a good thing.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.077
You know we're meant
to be together.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.746
Jared,
last night was a mistake.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.081
It was cheating.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.083
This is our chance
to make it right.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.720
All right, look. Tell me
what I'm supposed to do here.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.523
I don't know.
I-I'm --

07:03.523 --> 07:05.992
I can't do this.
I can't be the other woman.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.261
You want me
to tell Lourdes?
No, no.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.930
Mick,
I want to be with you.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.600
Look, I know it's messy, okay,
but...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.669
we'll get through it
together.

07:15.669 --> 07:19.339
Lourdes, she's --
She's your wife
and my best friend.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.377
Don't you love her?

07:26.546 --> 07:28.348
Of course I do.

07:28.348 --> 07:32.152
So do I.
I'm not doing this to her.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.655
It doesn't matter what happened
to us five years ago.

07:35.655 --> 07:38.091
It matters
what we do now.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.029
I'm sorry.

these reflections ♪

08:04.784 --> 08:06.820
Really? Again?

one night off?

08:08.388 --> 08:10.557
What, now that we think Cal's
the Major's Holy Grail?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.258
No, I can't.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.594
Plus,
he gave me homework.
Cal?

08:14.594 --> 08:16.096
He told Grace
I couldn't watch him tomorrow

08:16.096 --> 08:17.330
because I was gonna be
too busy

08:17.330 --> 08:18.598
helping a man
from the plane.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.835
I'm trying to figure out
what that means.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.605
So you may be hanging with Cal
tomorrow, if that's cool.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.207
Yeah, sounds fun.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.744
Plus, it'll keep me
out of trouble.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.113
Why?
What's going on?

08:33.113 --> 08:36.082
Just trying to dig myself
out of a gigantic hole

08:36.082 --> 08:37.851
filled with quicksand.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.720
Colorful.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.288
Jared?
Mm.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.125
Want to talk about it?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.459
No, not really.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.062
Think I just need
to take a break from it.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.098
So, uh, how are you planning
on figuring out

08:52.098 --> 08:54.401
what man from the plane
you're supposed to help?

08:54.401 --> 08:56.136
No idea.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.571
We just have to trust
that any calling Cal has

08:58.571 --> 09:01.307
is pointing me to things
I should know --

09:01.307 --> 09:03.443
need to know.
To what end, Ben?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.211
I mean, you really think
this is gonna help us

09:05.211 --> 09:07.180
figure out 828,
why we're back?

09:07.180 --> 09:10.683
Right now, this is about
keeping Cal safe, day by day.

09:10.683 --> 09:11.684
You're doing that.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.219
Am I?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.421
Cal's biggest threat
is the Major,

09:14.421 --> 09:16.022
and I have zero clue
who she is.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.124
Don't do that.
Don't start spiraling.

but I need your help.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.472
No.

It's that everyone blames you

How can they? No one even knows
what went on that night.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.611
Oh, it doesn't matter.

Well,
according to the NTSB,

12:23.910 --> 12:27.380
the exact flight conditions
from the night we disappeared.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.983
Hmm.
There's only one problem.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.220
That storm?

12:34.220 --> 12:36.189
Storm?
No, Ben.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.757
I fly through stuff like this
all the time.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.726
This barely qualifies
as weather.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.862
So it's not
how you remember it?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.397
Ben,
you were on that flight.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.300
You know what kind of turbulence
we hit.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.402
And I've been flying simulations
on this data

12:49.402 --> 12:51.070
every day
since we came back,

12:51.070 --> 12:54.741
and I can't find anything like
the storm we flew into on 828.

12:54.741 --> 12:58.077
It certainly felt big.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.279
It was enormous.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.914
And it came out of nowhere.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.865
This is not that storm.

13:18.865 --> 13:23.536
This is
a government cover-up.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.472
Bill,
I don't understand.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.775
Why would the government
cover up a storm?

13:28.775 --> 13:29.776
'Cause we came back?

13:29.776 --> 13:31.110
No, no, you're missing
the point.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.645
Hit that thing.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.649
Check the date
on that report.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.820
No, the simulator data...

13:43.322 --> 13:45.925
...it's from 2013.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.028
The government didn't start
hiding things

13:49.028 --> 13:51.364
on the day we came back.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.666
It started on the day
we disappeared.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.542
Yeah, I know.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.178
Okay.
Thanks, Amuta.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.512
Yep.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.548
Co-pilot completely backs
Daly's story.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.183
Where is the co-pilot
in all this?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.251
Back in Jamaica.
No, thank you.

14:12.251 --> 14:16.055
He says Daly's the only reason
any of us survived that flight.
I don't know, Ben.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.758
How sure are we this
isn't just two men trying
to clear their name?

14:18.758 --> 14:20.560
Of course Daly's trying
to clear his name.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.261
He's the face
of what happened to us,

14:22.261 --> 14:24.597
and he'll never be able
to escape it.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.233
Mick, Cal's the one who told me
I was supposed to help him.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.935
Daly was flying the plane.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.404
If anyone knows what the weather
was like that night, it's him.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.173
But why would they publish
an inaccurate weather report?

14:34.173 --> 14:37.977
How do we know Daly isn't
exaggerating or misremembering?

14:37.977 --> 14:40.680
I don't know.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.316
But I remember
what I felt up there,

14:43.316 --> 14:44.884
and I know you do, too.

14:44.884 --> 14:49.255
Mostly...
I can't get past this.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.458
You read all of this,
didn't you?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.660
It's the minutes from
the Congressional investigation.

14:54.660 --> 14:58.631
On January 4, 2014,
a meteorologist was scheduled

14:58.631 --> 15:01.000
to testify to the panel
about the plane's disappearance.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.435
He never showed

15:02.435 --> 15:04.203
and then abruptly retired
to Massapequa.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.472
-That's interesting.
-It's more than interesting.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.708
This guy was studying
coastal erosion

15:08.708 --> 15:11.878
in the exact area
the plane disappeared.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.346
Whatever happened
that night,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.515
he was in perfect position
to see it.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.949
He's still there
in Massapequa?

15:16.949 --> 15:19.485
Yeah. Daly's coming
to pick me up now.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.359
Ben: Roger Mencin?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.627
No Bibles, no votes,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.295
don't rent out the dock.
You can move on.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.330
No, we're not here
about any of that.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.599
We have a few questions
about 828.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.104
You're the captain.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.439
William Daly.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.341
Dr. Mencin, we're trying
to figure out

15:42.341 --> 15:43.409
what happened
to that plane.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.244
We believe you can help.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.580
What makes you think I know
anything about that flight?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.916
Because there was a storm
that night,

15:49.916 --> 15:52.018
and you had the most
sophisticated instrumentation

15:52.018 --> 15:53.119
in the area.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.220
You know the truth.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.255
Did the NTSB
get it wrong?

15:56.255 --> 15:57.957
What were you gonna tell
Congress?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.495
Please. We flew through
something giant.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.865
It was different.
I can't talk about this.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.234
They made me swear
under oath.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.836
Who is "they"?

16:12.605 --> 16:16.042
Please. He's just trying
to clear his name.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.845
The whole world thinks he's
responsible for what happened.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.381
You know he's not.

16:25.251 --> 16:29.121
Okay. We're gonna do some
homework like your mom said,

16:29.121 --> 16:32.158
and then we can get back
to some more awesomeness.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.292
Did you like doing
homework

16:33.292 --> 16:34.627
when you were in school,
Auntie Mick?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.095
No, of course not.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.331
There's only one Stone sibling
that was a big enough nerd

16:38.331 --> 16:39.799
to like homework.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.737
Can I play some Xbox first
to warm up my brain?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.606
Does that normally work
on your dad?

16:46.606 --> 16:49.008
-No.
-Gimme some credit, buddy.

16:56.382 --> 17:01.487
Sorry. I-I know it's weird
to just show up like this.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.955
I need your help.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.357
What's up, Autumn?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.859
It's kind of hard
to explain.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.828
Can we go for coffee
or something?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.763
Um, I can't leave
the little guy,

17:10.763 --> 17:12.865
but I can put a pot on
in here.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.867
Hey, Cal, you're good
if my friend Autumn comes

17:14.867 --> 17:16.536
and hangs with us
for a little bit?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.238
-You play video games?
-No. After your homework.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.573
Oh, my goodness.
Listen to me.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.408
Come on in.

17:25.978 --> 17:29.649
You ever hear
of dark lightning?

17:29.649 --> 17:32.418
It's a high-energy
atmospheric discharge,

17:32.418 --> 17:35.187
and it releases lots
of ionizing radiation.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.691
For years, no one even knew
it existed

17:38.691 --> 17:41.127
because you have to be
very close to detect it.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.528
But you saw it?

17:42.528 --> 17:44.430
I discovered it
on my instruments.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.099
But the DOD, they don't like
what they don't understand,

17:47.099 --> 17:49.936
and the idea
of some magic lightning

17:49.936 --> 17:53.773
taking down an airplane,
well...

17:53.773 --> 17:55.708
Then when they found out
that I was gonna testify,

17:55.708 --> 17:58.177
they suggested
that I take early retirement.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.947
Suggested or threatened?

18:02.748 --> 18:05.284
I figured everyone on the plane
was dead.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.521
My testifying wasn't gonna
bring them back.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.590
But we are back.
And we need your help.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.992
Look, there's nothing
I can do.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.328
They made me, you know,
destroy every copy,

18:15.328 --> 18:17.063
delete every file.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.867
But you didn't,
did you?

18:24.604 --> 18:27.139
No, you find information
that ends your career,

18:27.139 --> 18:28.841
you hold on to it.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.478
Roger, lives were changed
forever because of that flight,

18:32.478 --> 18:35.848
and we had no say
in the matter.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.950
We deserve to know
what really happened.

18:37.950 --> 18:42.588
They've taken my reputation,
my career,

18:42.588 --> 18:44.190
and my family.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.658
All I want is the truth.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.761
You know, when that plane
came back,

18:48.761 --> 18:49.862
I knew it was just
a matter of time

18:49.862 --> 18:52.064
before someone
came looking.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.305
Guess
I should have moved.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.288
Autumn:
I know how it sounds.

19:16.288 --> 19:19.225
And I also know criminals
always say they're innocent,

19:19.225 --> 19:20.693
but I promise.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.561
I went legit.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.598
That's why I was in Jamaica --
to get away.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.299
Yeah,
that's why I went, too.

19:27.299 --> 19:31.103
But when the plane disappeared,
my "friends" did to me

19:31.103 --> 19:33.439
the things
that we'd done to other people.

19:33.439 --> 19:36.442
Stole my identity, pinned years
of theft and fraud on me,

19:36.442 --> 19:37.977
but I didn't do
any of it.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.247
By the time
I came back --

19:41.247 --> 19:45.618
I just want to be free to
embrace this new chance I have.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.253
I'm not sure
what I can do to help.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.722
I can't just make
a warrant disappear.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.257
I don't need you to.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.226
I just need your help
to find the person who did this.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.195
Her name is Clarissa Ford.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.532
If I can find her,
I can prove I'm innocent.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.469
Okay.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.038
Okay,
I'll see what I can do.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.580
Captain Daly: Okay, Raf.
One more time.

20:16.515 --> 20:19.752
Raf: Okay, new data entered.
You are good to go.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.124
Captain Daly:
With the actual data...

20:25.124 --> 20:28.561
not the lies
that the government published...

20:28.561 --> 20:31.731
I'll finally be able to prove
it wasn't my fault.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.334
Please let this be it.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.746
Finally.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.715
Hello, mama.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.284
Ben: My God.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.120
That came out of nowhere.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.722
What do you think
I've been saying?

20:59.992 --> 21:02.595
I've been over it
100 times.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.164
I made the airspeed
300 knots.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.635
Maintaining
a level altitude.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.036
You flew threw it?

21:11.036 --> 21:12.972
You're damn right
I did.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.581
Here comes the turbulence.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.091
We flew into the storm.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.462
And then we...

21:36.462 --> 21:38.230
Pull up.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.665
Pull up.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.800
Pull up.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.637
System shutdown.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.972
Damn it!

21:46.972 --> 21:50.276
Hit the reset, Raf.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.977
We're going again.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.048
Six times!
How the hell?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.383
We made it through
that storm.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.851
Yeah, but to five years
in the future.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.352
We're missing something.

22:00.352 --> 22:03.088
Bill, the simulator isn't gonna
transport us through time.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.990
I mean, how could it re-create
what we went through?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.059
But at least this proves
you weren't at fault.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.327
No, the only thing
this proves

22:08.327 --> 22:09.828
is that we're on
the right track.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.597
And that dark lightning
may be the source

22:11.597 --> 22:13.699
of what happened to us.
This is huge.

22:13.699 --> 22:17.236
Ben, I lost everything
because of 828.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.939
Until I can prove this was
the cause, this means nothing.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.075
And this storm didn't just
throw us through time.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.910
It also triggered
whatever mind-meld thing

22:24.910 --> 22:26.779
Fiona Clarke's
been going on about.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.681
And how
is that possible?

22:28.681 --> 22:32.451
She studies mind-melds,
and all our minds get melded.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.619
She's the missing link.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.087
Bill, she's one of us.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.755
She seems to be as in the dark
as we are.
No.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.090
I refuse to believe that.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.192
Someone powerful's
behind this cover-up.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.428
The -- T-The plane, the voices,
all of it.

22:42.428 --> 22:45.331
It makes perfect sense
that they'd keep a passenger

22:45.331 --> 22:49.435
who's an expert in this stuff
involved from the start.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.903
I tell you what.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.338
You stay here.
Keep trying.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.739
I'll go talk to Fiona.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.174
Maybe we should go
together.

22:55.174 --> 22:59.411
Look, she may be more open
with me alone,

22:59.411 --> 23:02.281
seeing as how I haven't been
calling her a government plant

23:02.281 --> 23:04.250
to her face
for the last week.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.496
Hey, how's Massapequa?

23:17.496 --> 23:19.031
Yeah, no, he's fine.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.634
Uh, Grace is gonna come get him
in an hour.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.336
Mick, Daly was right.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.005
One sec.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.440
Um, hey, buddy,
why don't you teach Autumn

23:28.440 --> 23:29.842
how to play this game?

23:29.842 --> 23:31.910
I'm in.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.846
He was right about what?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.714
Everything.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.884
Grab that blue binder.
I need you to look something up.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.319
Yeah, hold on.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.354
So, who do you want
to be?

23:42.354 --> 23:44.823
Uh, why don't you choose
for me?

23:44.823 --> 23:47.860
Okay. I got it.
What do you need?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.936
-Hey.
-Hey, he is all in one piece.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.072
I promise.
I wasn't worried.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.473
Hey!

24:01.473 --> 24:02.975
Mom, watch this.

24:04.209 --> 24:08.013
Whoa! Awesome!
A lot of blood.

24:08.013 --> 24:09.848
Yeah, you should see him and Ben
get into it.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.216
I can't tell
who the kid is.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.420
I let Dad win sometimes.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.455
Oh, that's my boy.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.890
Thank you so much
for watching him.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.158
He loves spending time
with you.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.694
Not at all.
Ditto.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.929
How you holding up?

24:23.929 --> 24:26.365
Uh...you know.

24:26.365 --> 24:29.201
It's not exactly
what I had pictured for myself

24:29.201 --> 24:30.669
at this point in my life.

24:30.669 --> 24:31.904
Yeah.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.406
You and me both.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.874
I take it things
with Jared

24:35.874 --> 24:38.544
haven't gotten
any less complicated.

24:38.544 --> 24:41.046
No.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.415
You'll get through it.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.983
You're amazing, Mick.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.653
You two will find
your way.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.655
So will you.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.357
Look,
I know Ben is my family,

24:51.357 --> 24:55.294
but you are the best thing
that has ever happened to him.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.129
I'm serious.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.065
I am rooting for you guys --
for both of you.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.402
Thank you.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.037
Rooting for us, too.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.106
He loves you.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.543
I know.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.312
And I love him.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.716
I just hope
it'll be enough.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.133
We shouldn't have
to track you down.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.868
I just turned the phone off
for a bit.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.171
It's never
to be turned off.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.739
We're overdue
for a chat.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.177
Dark lightning?

25:45.177 --> 25:47.312
Daly and I tracked down
a meteorologist

25:47.312 --> 25:49.248
who thinks we may have flown
through some,

25:49.248 --> 25:51.850
that it could have affected
our plane.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.318
I don't know.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.753
I'll admit,
it's not impossible,

25:54.753 --> 25:58.757
but  whatever happened
to us up there,

25:58.757 --> 26:02.561
it doesn't feel
accidental.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.498
Frankly, I believe we took
a step in our evolution.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.367
Daly's convinced himself
otherwise,

26:08.367 --> 26:10.402
and frankly,
he makes a strong case.

26:10.402 --> 26:14.473
Well, I understand Daly wanting
to prove he's not responsible.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.241
I thought it was my fault
when you told me

26:16.241 --> 26:20.479
the government was experimenting
on people using my research.

26:20.479 --> 26:23.182
The truth is,
Daly's no more to blame

26:23.182 --> 26:24.750
for what happened on that flight
than I am.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.485
I don't think that's gonna
bring him much comfort,

26:26.485 --> 26:29.621
seeing as how he thinks
you're behind this whole thing.

26:29.621 --> 26:31.723
Captain Daly is so convinced
of things,

26:31.723 --> 26:35.961
he's grasping at any straw
to try and make his case.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.764
He's lost sight
of the horizon.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.599
Don't you do the same.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.808
Jared: Hey.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.043
What are you working on?

26:51.043 --> 26:54.646
I'm just helping out
a friend.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.281
Need help?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.150
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.252
Are you sure?

27:00.252 --> 27:01.753
No lines
you need crossed,

27:01.753 --> 27:05.424
favors that might bite me
in the ass later on?

27:05.424 --> 27:07.426
Think I gotta do it all
on my own now.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.129
Mick, I'm here for you
if you ever need me.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.297
No matter what.
Jared, we can't --

27:17.336 --> 27:19.404
-What is it?
-I gotta make a call.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.720
Hey, what's up?

27:34.720 --> 27:37.589
Your meteorologist,
Roger Mencin -- he's dead.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.659
What? How?

27:40.659 --> 27:43.362
Boating accident.
Just came across our system.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.765
Ben, somebody knows
that you're looking into this.

27:46.765 --> 27:48.100
We gotta warn Daly.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.501
Okay.
I'll meet you there.

27:51.537 --> 27:54.173
Yo, Captain,
you in there?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.674
What'd he do,
talk someone to death?

27:55.674 --> 27:58.143
We're worried Captain Daly
might be in some danger.

27:58.143 --> 27:59.344
What, from those
religious freaks

27:59.344 --> 28:00.646
that have been
following him around?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.147
Whole thing's
a complete cluster.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.650
Oh. Thank you.
We've got it from here.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.985
Thanks.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.564
Daly, you in here?

28:20.065 --> 28:21.733
Wow.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.141
I didn't know
it was this bad.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.909
Michaela:
No sign of him.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.689
Hey, earth to Ben.

28:43.689 --> 28:48.360
Is this what Grace sees
when she looks at me?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.295
Ben,
you're just thorough.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.463
You're trying to protect
your family.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.966
You're trying to protect
all of us.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.200
Daly, this is --

28:55.200 --> 28:57.769
Desperate.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.551
He's going looking
for dark lightning,

29:12.551 --> 29:13.785
for real,
no simulator.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.387
What do you mean?
Look at this.

29:15.387 --> 29:18.690
Today's weather report,
navigational charts.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.459
There's a storm
off the coast.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.661
He's so desperate to prove
828 wasn't his fault,

29:22.661 --> 29:23.996
he's gonna fly
right into it.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.597
Can he actually do that?
I doubt it,

29:25.597 --> 29:28.734
but it could definitely
get him killed.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.339
Captain.

29:34.339 --> 29:35.907
I'm glad you came.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.576
I just put the kettle on.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.312
We need
to set some things straight.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.547
I was thinking
the same thing.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.114
Hey, kiddo.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.583
How was your day
with Auntie Mick?

30:18.583 --> 30:20.552
Fun.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.688
Yeah?

30:22.688 --> 30:26.391
She say anything
about how your dad's doing?

30:26.391 --> 30:28.293
Eating a lot
of TV dinners?

30:28.293 --> 30:30.796
Dad's okay.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.698
He's out helping people.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.470
Yeah, that's your dad.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.106
I want to be like him.

30:41.106 --> 30:43.608
I want to help people,
too.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.453
Ben:
Please, this is urgent.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.388
I was just here
with Captain Daly.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.056
Remember Bermuda Triangle,
the whole thing?

30:58.056 --> 30:59.424
You were here.
Sorry.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.026
You need new authorization
for each visit.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.462
NYPD.
A little out of
your jurisdiction, aren't you?

31:03.462 --> 31:04.730
Harris, is it?

31:04.730 --> 31:06.298
We have reason
to believe William Daly's

31:06.298 --> 31:07.532
about to steal
an airplane.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.000
What, the cargo loaders

31:09.000 --> 31:10.602
put you up to this?
We're dead serious.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.404
Come on!
He's in the simulator,

31:12.404 --> 31:14.639
like he's been every day
for the past three weeks.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.208
It's a little sad,
if you ask me.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.243
Aren't the simulators
over there?

31:18.243 --> 31:20.479
Then what's he doing
over there?

31:25.817 --> 31:28.019
Joe.
It's Harris.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.254
We got a problem.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.818
Man: All aircraft,
this is ground control.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.519
We have a runaway incursion.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.288
Ordering a full ground stop.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.924
Hey, why are you stopping?
We need to get him!

33:45.924 --> 33:48.693
I need to explain to you
what a full ground stop means?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.596
Can I talk to him
on that?

33:51.596 --> 33:54.466
The emergency frequency
should get you through
to the cockpit radio.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.301
Daly, it's Ben.

33:56.301 --> 33:57.936
Please don't do this.

33:57.936 --> 34:00.338
Sorry, Ben.
I have no choice.

34:00.338 --> 34:03.375
Man: Unidentified aircraft,
please identify yourself.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.643
This is
Captain William Daly

34:04.643 --> 34:06.211
requesting
takeoff clearance

34:06.211 --> 34:08.046
on runway
two-niner left.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.447
That request is denied.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.816
Power down your engines
immediately.

34:11.816 --> 34:13.818
Bill, I know
it's not your fault.

34:13.818 --> 34:16.588
I can help you prove it.
But if you steal that plane,

34:16.588 --> 34:18.323
none of this
is gonna matter.

34:18.323 --> 34:19.591
You don't get it, Ben.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.559
I need to see this
all the way through.

34:21.559 --> 34:25.130
You can't help me
anymore.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.631
But she can.

34:26.631 --> 34:30.068
She's my missing link.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.874
My God.
What have you done?

34:38.109 --> 34:39.544
Help!

34:39.544 --> 34:40.979
He's got Fiona.

34:40.979 --> 34:42.847
I'll call it in.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.385
This is madness.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.154
I had nothing to do
with 828.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.523
We weren't brought back
to be turning on each other.

34:51.523 --> 34:52.624
Let me go!

34:52.624 --> 34:53.692
Unauthorized aircraft,

34:53.692 --> 34:55.193
this is your last warning.

34:55.193 --> 34:56.628
Power down your engines,

34:56.628 --> 34:58.830
or we will notify
the Air National Guard.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.270
Bill, stop!
Please, stop!

35:05.270 --> 35:06.771
I'm sorry.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.107
This is the only way
to prove I did nothing wrong.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.409
No.
Let me out!

35:11.409 --> 35:13.311
No, no, no, no, no!

35:13.311 --> 35:15.213
Michaela: No! No!

35:15.213 --> 35:17.582
No!
Daly, don't do this!

35:33.264 --> 35:34.265
What are you doing?

35:34.265 --> 35:35.533
Where are you taking me?

35:35.533 --> 35:36.868
I know the truth.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.170
I can help you prove it,
but not if you do this.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.039
If you keep going,
the whole world

35:41.039 --> 35:43.408
is gonna think
you were behind Flight 828.

35:43.408 --> 35:46.044
No.
This will make me a hero.

35:46.044 --> 35:48.613
The guy who uncovered
what really happened.

35:48.613 --> 35:49.814
Damn it!

35:49.814 --> 35:51.082
What does he think
he's gonna do?

35:51.082 --> 35:53.351
He thinks
he can fly through time.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.888
Wait.
Can he?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.890
Captain Daly:
This is the only way, Ben.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.725
It's the only way
to give my life some meaning.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.762
Proving this
is all I have left.

36:03.762 --> 36:07.065
I can do it again.
Fiona can show me how.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.567
Captain, I don't know
what happened on that plane

36:09.567 --> 36:11.436
any more than you do.

36:11.436 --> 36:13.371
Bill,
Fiona can't help you.

36:13.371 --> 36:14.773
She's innocent
in all this.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.508
Of course she's part of it.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.477
Who do you think told the Major
about the meteorologist?

36:19.477 --> 36:20.645
What?

36:20.645 --> 36:22.480
I did no such thing.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.482
Did you tell her?

36:31.623 --> 36:33.558
Daly,
if you don't turn around,

36:33.558 --> 36:35.493
those planes
will shoot you down.

36:35.493 --> 36:37.328
Not if I'm in the future.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.698
Man: Captain Daly,
this is the Air National Guard.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.667
Your flight plan
is unauthorized.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.002
What say we turn
that bird around

36:44.002 --> 36:46.137
and get your feet
on the ground?

36:46.137 --> 36:49.107
Negative.
A.N.G., be advised.

36:49.107 --> 36:51.843
I am not a threat.
I have no intention of harm.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.211
Ben: Bill, please.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.579
If you turn that plane
toward the city,

36:54.579 --> 36:55.580
it's over.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.220
Bill,
you're more than a pilot.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.489
You're a father.
You have a family.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.524
They don't need me.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.126
No, I need you!

37:08.126 --> 37:10.361
You're the only one that
can help me figure this out.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.596
You're the captain.

37:11.596 --> 37:14.099
No.
You're the captain now.

37:14.099 --> 37:16.267
The passengers
are your responsibility.

37:16.267 --> 37:17.736
You're their leader.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.944
Per protocol,

37:25.944 --> 37:28.980
climbing
to penetration altitude.

37:30.381 --> 37:32.550
Captain, you think you were
the only one who suffered

37:32.550 --> 37:34.586
because of Flight 828?

37:34.586 --> 37:36.988
My entire life's work
was proven true,

37:36.988 --> 37:38.756
and yet I was kept out
of the loop.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.659
Making airspeed
300 knots.

37:41.659 --> 37:42.894
If I were really behind
all this,

37:42.894 --> 37:45.330
why would I not have included
myself?

37:45.330 --> 37:46.698
I've heard no voices,

37:46.698 --> 37:49.434
experienced
no collective consciousness.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.069
Last chance, Doctor.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.271
Tell me what I gotta do to make
the dark lightning happen?

37:53.271 --> 37:55.507
Daly, damn it!
I already told you.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.741
I don't know!

38:00.111 --> 38:02.881
Then I'll do the same
as before.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.883
Let's see
if lightning strikes twice.

38:06.384 --> 38:08.153
Come on.
Get there.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.854
F-16 Pilot: Command,
this is Viper One-One.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.023
Target is unresponsive.
Heading toward land.

38:12.023 --> 38:15.393
Commander: Viper One-One.
You are cleared to engage.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.694
Bill!

38:16.694 --> 38:18.663
Per protocol,

38:18.663 --> 38:21.199
adjusting flight path
to storm center.

38:22.267 --> 38:25.136
I'm not ready to die, Bill.
Please.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.305
Who said anything
about dying?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.240
I'll see you in 2024.

38:37.515 --> 38:38.917
No. No.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.485
F-16 Pilot:
Command, this is Viper One-One.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.787
Threat has been neutralized.

39:21.426 --> 39:24.529
Reporter: The search continues
for Captain William Daly

39:24.529 --> 39:26.364
and Professor Fiona Clarke.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.934
Hours after their plane was
reportedly shot from the sky,

39:29.934 --> 39:31.636
the plane's remains
as well as...

39:31.636 --> 39:36.207
Hey, it's me. I have some stuff
I need to drop off for Cal.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.176
I was hoping I could come by
and say good night.

39:38.176 --> 39:39.944
...large numbers,
electric with the hope

39:39.944 --> 39:44.249
that yet another miracle may
have saved the 828 returnees.

39:44.249 --> 39:47.452
One person I spoke with
was adamant that Daly was able

39:47.452 --> 39:51.422
to transport into time, just
like he did with Flight 828.

39:51.422 --> 39:54.659
Another felt the disappearance
was a part of a conspiracy

39:54.659 --> 39:56.394
against the passengers.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.664
Overall, the theories are
as numerous as the mourners,

39:59.664 --> 40:01.032
but there is one truth

40:01.032 --> 40:03.201
that seems to be
making itself clear --

40:03.201 --> 40:05.370
the 828 passengers have
a growing fan base...

40:05.370 --> 40:07.705
20 feet.

40:07.705 --> 40:09.674
Daly was sitting
just 20 feet from us,

40:09.674 --> 40:12.243
and the whole world blamed him
for what happened.

40:12.243 --> 40:16.814
Lost his family, his son,
and I couldn't help him.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.449
Ben, look at me.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.686
This is not your fault.
Daly went off the rails.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.054
He couldn't
let go of things,

40:23.054 --> 40:25.490
even things
that were out of his control.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.493
Look, I know that there is a lot
going on around us right now,

40:28.493 --> 40:30.628
but I am worried that
you are doing the same thing.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.430
He was right
about so many things --

40:32.430 --> 40:36.200
the -- the buried weather
reports, the meteorologist.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.436
I mean, maybe Fiona really
was working for the Major.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.204
Fiona helped save
those passengers.

40:40.204 --> 40:42.173
She --
She took care of them.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.409
How can you honestly question
whose side she was on?

40:44.409 --> 40:46.644
Then how did they find
the meteorologist?

40:46.644 --> 40:48.846
Someone had to tell them.

40:51.649 --> 40:52.917
Maybe I did.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.986
Hey, how's Massapequa?

40:56.321 --> 40:57.855
What?

40:57.855 --> 40:59.290
Autumn was here
when you called.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.293
I-I asked you about Massapequa
in front of her.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.496
What if Autumn
is the mole?

41:05.496 --> 41:07.198
T-The Major, she's looking
for the Holy Grail --

41:07.198 --> 41:10.101
the passenger most affected
by the calling.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.936
Cal.
What if she told them
about his drawings,

41:11.936 --> 41:13.137
about how he helps us?

41:13.137 --> 41:14.706
She was with him all day.

41:20.978 --> 41:24.182
Hey, Cal! Your dad's coming over
to say good night.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.624
Kiddo, did you hear me?

41:38.496 --> 41:40.365
Cal?

42:05.189 --> 42:06.557
Cal.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.860
Cal! Cal!
