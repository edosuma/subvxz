WEBVTT

00:55.400 --> 00:57.866
Where is the location of the bomb?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.400
With the help of Chul-young,

01:03.666 --> 01:07.066
Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa manage to reach
the target of terror attack, Gwanghwamun.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.966
After a gun battle with the terrorists,

01:10.533 --> 01:12.766
they succeed in stopping
the nuclear terror attack.

01:19.833 --> 01:23.500
It was a clear act of treachery
and betrayal to South Korea.

01:25.033 --> 01:25.900
Why did you do it?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.866
All I thought about was to take revenge.

01:30.566 --> 01:31.433
Afterwards,

01:31.600 --> 01:32.700
Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa

01:32.866 --> 01:34.666
are interrogated by the NIS.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.433
The Blue House and Chul-young

01:36.800 --> 01:39.833
focus on revealing
the true identity of Iris.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.200
The incomplete Iris list...

01:47.033 --> 01:49.333
I was hoping that you would
put an end to it.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.400
EPISODE 18

02:06.033 --> 02:07.000
The...

02:08.766 --> 02:10.000
thing I asked you about...

02:10.466 --> 02:12.666
Oh that, I set it up
so you could see it on my PC.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.300
Here's the access code.

02:24.433 --> 02:25.466
Thanks.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.966
I won't be returning to the NSS.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.200
If it's because of what the director said,

03:24.866 --> 03:26.066
you don't have to worry about it.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.900
No. It's not because of that.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.300
Then, what?

03:31.033 --> 03:32.333
I heard that the true identity

03:33.033 --> 03:35.400
of Iris has not been fully revealed yet.

03:36.033 --> 03:39.033
Also, that the Blue House wants you
to investigate what lies behind them.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.733
For the first time in two years,

03:46.333 --> 03:47.566
I was able to sleep well

03:48.766 --> 03:50.266
without any nightmares haunting me.

03:51.633 --> 03:53.266
To walk into the nightmares once again

03:54.600 --> 03:55.766
is a bit frightening.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.066
All right.

04:02.833 --> 04:03.766
But,

04:04.966 --> 04:06.766
don't haste to make up your mind.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.666
Reconsider it after taking some rest.

05:03.566 --> 05:04.600
Where's Mi-jeong?

05:07.133 --> 05:08.033
Well...

05:08.100 --> 05:09.000
What?

05:09.500 --> 05:10.500
Did something happen?

05:11.333 --> 05:13.133
Mi-jeong didn't show up today.

05:13.900 --> 05:14.766
What?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.166
We couldn't contact her, either.

05:17.566 --> 05:19.166
What is she thinking at a time like this?

05:20.266 --> 05:21.266
Call her in, now!

05:21.900 --> 05:22.833
Yes, sir.

06:38.966 --> 06:39.966
What's on your mind?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
Nothing.

06:45.900 --> 06:46.800
And

06:47.666 --> 06:49.366
I'm glad to not think about anything.

06:51.866 --> 06:52.900
I just

06:53.500 --> 06:55.166
have to accept the ocean

06:56.433 --> 06:58.766
that lies in front of me
just the way I see it.

07:03.533 --> 07:04.500
So do I.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.666
I don't have to think
about complicated things

07:08.166 --> 07:09.200
and accept you, Hyun-jun,

07:09.833 --> 07:11.933
just the way I see you.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.700
Where have you been?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.933
Oh, I just had someone to meet.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.100
Who?

08:24.600 --> 08:25.933
It's a university friend of mine,

08:26.033 --> 08:27.966
and she got married to someone here,
from Jeju Island.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.400
They are running an orange farm now.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.300
They already have two children,

08:31.533 --> 08:32.700
and they are so cute.

08:32.766 --> 08:33.700
Oh...

08:37.400 --> 08:39.133
Extremely Loud

08:40.200 --> 08:41.433
and Incredibly Close ?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.866
What kind a book title is that?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.433
It's a story of a nine-year old child

08:48.466 --> 08:49.966
who lost his father

08:50.200 --> 08:52.133
during the 911 terror.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.533
He somewhat resembles me.

08:56.866 --> 08:57.866
So,

08:58.366 --> 08:59.366
the book

08:59.600 --> 09:01.900
works like a cure for me.

09:08.433 --> 09:09.866
You have a definite cure next to you.

09:09.933 --> 09:11.566
Why would you read this instead of it?

09:12.533 --> 09:13.466
What is it?

09:15.400 --> 09:16.333
Me!

09:22.566 --> 09:24.566
Should we start the treatment?

09:49.900 --> 09:50.866
How is it?

09:51.766 --> 09:52.866
Is it showing effect?

09:54.066 --> 09:55.000
A little.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.300
CALLER ID BLOCKED

11:15.133 --> 11:16.133
Hello?

11:17.933 --> 11:19.000
Yes, it's me.

11:22.966 --> 11:24.066
Where are you right now?

11:32.966 --> 11:34.066
Okay.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.866
Status reporting.

13:03.933 --> 13:04.966
We are getting in a tunnel.

13:05.066 --> 13:06.433
Nothing special occurred yet.

13:50.633 --> 13:51.633
Damn it.

14:14.366 --> 14:15.766
My... my apologies, sir.

14:19.366 --> 14:20.666
You don't have to say anything.

14:21.766 --> 14:23.733
We will succeed our mission at all cost.

15:10.466 --> 15:11.933
SANG-HYUN PARK

15:15.833 --> 15:16.766
Yes, sir.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.100
You have to return, now.

15:18.266 --> 15:19.700
I already told you. I really--

15:19.766 --> 15:22.000
Director Baek and Sa-woo Jin escaped
during their escort!

15:22.766 --> 15:24.200
I sent you a helicopter. Get here fast.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.466
Hello?

15:27.700 --> 15:28.600
Sir.

15:41.866 --> 15:43.300
SEUNG-HEE

15:48.100 --> 15:49.366
The phone is switched off...

15:54.600 --> 15:56.133
Everyone except the dead Sung-sik Eo

15:56.833 --> 15:57.933
disappeared into thin air.

15:58.533 --> 15:59.666
What about the escort agents?

15:59.866 --> 16:01.766
Except for one
that is being sent to the hospital,

16:02.966 --> 16:04.200
they were all killed in action.

16:09.933 --> 16:11.033
Yes, it's me.

16:14.066 --> 16:15.000
Okay.

16:19.033 --> 16:21.466
The agent being sent
to the hospital died as well.

16:25.366 --> 16:26.733
The attack on the transport vehicle

16:27.266 --> 16:29.033
probably didn't take longer
than ten minutes

16:29.766 --> 16:31.600
for them to attack

16:32.733 --> 16:34.800
and disappear
after accomplishing their mission.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.666
The ones who assaulted the vehicle

16:37.366 --> 16:40.166
are multiple squads
who received special training.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.200
How did they figure out the exact route

16:44.266 --> 16:46.066
and time of the transport vehicle?

16:47.733 --> 16:49.033
This transportation plan

16:49.333 --> 16:51.566
was known to no one
except for the agents assigned for it.

16:51.633 --> 16:53.833
Even the people within the NIS
knew nothing about it.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.366
Same on our part.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.666
The only ones aware of the route and time

16:58.100 --> 16:59.366
were Director Kang-oh Yoo

16:59.566 --> 17:00.700
and me.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.233
Is there no trace
of the escaped prisoners at all?

17:18.633 --> 17:21.233
We were unable to find
any clue or lead yet.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.833
What about satellite tracking?

17:22.900 --> 17:24.333
The tunnels in the mountain zone are

17:24.700 --> 17:26.133
making it difficult to use satellite.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.900
Do everything you can to prevent them

17:28.266 --> 17:29.700
from escaping to a foreign country.

17:29.866 --> 17:30.900
This case,

17:30.966 --> 17:32.666
will be assigned to the NSS.

17:32.833 --> 17:35.633
I will ask the NIS for their cooperation.

17:36.066 --> 17:37.100
Yes, sir.

19:10.866 --> 19:12.800
How did you get hold of this place?

19:13.466 --> 19:14.933
The headquarters prepared it for us.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.500
This is San Baek.

19:48.566 --> 19:49.466
Yes.

19:50.466 --> 19:51.733
We just arrived.

19:53.866 --> 19:54.833
Yes, sir.

19:57.833 --> 19:58.733
This man

19:58.900 --> 20:00.266
is from the Delta Force.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.800
He belongs to the civil military service,

20:02.233 --> 20:04.400
which is a private military company
run by our headquarters.

20:04.533 --> 20:07.000
He was on a mission in Kosovo and Darfur
to assist American military

20:07.600 --> 20:10.266
and was active in Afghanistan
until he got summoned for this mission.

20:13.133 --> 20:15.633
These are military trainers
from the secret camp in Sierra Leone.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.200
They produce the best mercenary.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.133
From this point on,

20:26.200 --> 20:27.600
every command during the mission

20:28.100 --> 20:29.500
will be called by Sa-woo Jin.

20:37.633 --> 20:38.933
I'm Sa-woo Jin.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.633
You've done a great job.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.100
Your actions in Japan and South Korea

22:04.966 --> 22:06.566
were reported
as you carrying out my orders

22:06.666 --> 22:08.666
in order to stop a coup.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Thus, no one will bother you with it
anymore.

22:12.066 --> 22:13.166
Thank you.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.733
You may return to North Korean
Supreme Guard headquarters.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.566
If my opinion can be taken into account,

22:23.300 --> 22:24.733
I do not wish to return to

22:26.933 --> 22:28.166
the headquarters.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.766
Tell me what you want.

22:33.366 --> 22:34.866
I wish to return to my hometown.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.033
I can farm there

22:38.300 --> 22:39.766
or become a teacher.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.500
I would want to live like that.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.266
I think I'll be heading back
to South Korea,

22:50.033 --> 22:51.833
to prepare for the summit discussion.

22:52.900 --> 22:53.833
I was hoping that

22:55.433 --> 22:57.100
you would help me, Sun-hwa.

22:58.633 --> 22:59.866
I do not want

23:01.133 --> 23:02.666
to go back to South Korea.

23:05.433 --> 23:06.400
Hyun-jun Kim...

23:08.533 --> 23:09.933
Is it because of him?

23:14.900 --> 23:15.933
I just

23:18.000 --> 23:19.500
hope it is something like

23:21.533 --> 23:22.833
a cold.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.266
Even if it hurts a lot,

23:26.500 --> 23:27.733
just

23:30.100 --> 23:31.533
after one night of going through pain,

23:34.733 --> 23:36.133
I hope I can walk it off

23:37.233 --> 23:39.533
like it was

23:41.100 --> 23:42.433
nothing at all.

23:56.533 --> 23:57.600
I hope

23:58.266 --> 24:00.366
you become happy, Sun-hwa.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.000
I want you to stop making hard decisions.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.000
Give some time to think about

24:09.500 --> 24:11.333
the problem regarding going back
to South Korea.

24:13.533 --> 24:14.533
For now,

24:16.666 --> 24:17.766
rest.

24:24.966 --> 24:25.833
Sir!

24:26.433 --> 24:27.500
Oh, you got here?

24:27.833 --> 24:28.766
What happened?

24:28.866 --> 24:30.233
The ones who ambushed the vehicle

24:30.500 --> 24:32.766
are not just troops.
They're a special trained force.

24:33.166 --> 24:34.766
The information about the route and time

24:34.966 --> 24:36.233
was all leaked.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.766
On top of that,

24:38.866 --> 24:40.600
Mi-jeong was found dead.

24:40.766 --> 24:41.733
What?

24:51.433 --> 24:52.800
Go to the Forensic Science Division.

25:12.633 --> 25:13.800
What happened?

25:26.333 --> 25:27.533
I never knew

25:27.633 --> 25:30.400
I would perform an autopsy on her
with my own hands.

25:32.766 --> 25:33.900
What was the cause of death?

25:35.333 --> 25:37.466
Her autonomic nervous system was damaged

25:38.066 --> 25:39.966
due to a cervical spinal fracture.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.066
Killed her in one shot.

25:44.266 --> 25:45.866
Is there anything else that was found?

25:46.500 --> 25:47.500
No.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.500
Not even a single fingerprint was left.

25:49.566 --> 25:51.166
I checked her belongings.

25:51.933 --> 25:53.300
Her phone was gone,

25:53.533 --> 25:54.666
and her computer

25:55.300 --> 25:56.833
was damaged seriously.

25:56.900 --> 25:57.866
Can you restore it?

25:57.933 --> 25:59.900
I'm already working on it now
but can't say for sure.

26:02.766 --> 26:04.800
This was done by a professional.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.033
We just finished restoring
Mi-jeong's computer hardware.

26:14.733 --> 26:15.766
And...

26:17.166 --> 26:18.300
Within the restored files,

26:18.700 --> 26:20.766
there was information
on Director Baek's transportation.

26:23.466 --> 26:24.766
How is that there?

26:24.866 --> 26:26.000
Someone hacked into

26:26.466 --> 26:28.466
Director Kang-oh Yoo's terminal
via server.

26:28.866 --> 26:30.600
We think that's how the information
got leaked.

26:30.766 --> 26:31.933
Who would do such thing?

26:32.300 --> 26:33.200
Well...

26:33.266 --> 26:35.066
We checked the server history,

26:36.300 --> 26:37.533
and it was Secretary Hyun-kyu Oh.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.433
What? Me... me?

26:39.833 --> 26:40.833
Me?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.866
No... no. it wasn't me.

26:42.933 --> 26:44.600
Even though it is recorded
in server history?

26:44.666 --> 26:46.033
Oh that... That was...

26:46.100 --> 26:48.266
That was because I gave Mi-jeong

26:48.333 --> 26:49.600
my server access card.

26:49.666 --> 26:50.600
Why?

26:51.033 --> 26:52.666
After the new director was appointed,

26:53.500 --> 26:56.200
he shut down my server access rights.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.933
So I asked Mi-jeong to fix it for me.

26:59.366 --> 27:00.366
Are you insane?

27:00.533 --> 27:01.966
How could you give away your access card

27:02.066 --> 27:03.466
to a person with a low security level?

27:04.966 --> 27:06.266
I... didn't...

27:06.866 --> 27:07.833
I...

27:07.900 --> 27:10.933
I didn't know it would turn out like this!

27:30.266 --> 27:32.166
SEUNG-HEE CHOI

27:35.400 --> 27:37.766
The phone is switched off. Please leave...

28:20.933 --> 28:22.633
What are you trying to do
with those troops?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.466
The President...

28:24.533 --> 28:26.666
keeps trying to hold
the summit discussion.

28:28.533 --> 28:29.866
We have to stop that.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.666
Is it even possible

28:34.466 --> 28:35.766
with this force?

28:36.400 --> 28:37.333
I don't know.

28:39.100 --> 28:40.466
What would you do?

28:42.766 --> 28:45.633
If we kill the person who is trying
to hold the summit discussion,

28:46.200 --> 28:47.266
wouldn't it all end?

28:50.100 --> 28:51.833
You mean the President?

29:02.566 --> 29:04.400
Here are the call records
of Mi-jeong's phone.

29:06.766 --> 29:09.000
Most of them are verified
as family or friends,

29:09.133 --> 29:10.833
but we couldn't track down one number.

29:11.266 --> 29:13.866
It's not much, but they contacted
each other continuously.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.200
Since when did they start?

29:15.366 --> 29:16.700
About four months ago.

29:18.566 --> 29:20.733
This must be the owner of the number.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.566
This is a private folder
in Mi-jeong's personal blog.

29:26.700 --> 29:27.833
After decoding it,

29:28.466 --> 29:29.700
these pictures were there.

29:29.866 --> 29:31.233
The first photo was uploaded

29:31.400 --> 29:32.533
about four months ago.

29:33.000 --> 29:33.900
Keep scrolling.

29:36.466 --> 29:38.700
Zoom in here and get rid of the mosaic.

29:41.766 --> 29:43.133
It's going to be difficult to tell.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.333
Wait.

30:01.666 --> 30:02.700
Mister.

30:10.666 --> 30:11.800
Yuki.

30:26.966 --> 30:28.400
We don't know his name nor nationality.

30:28.466 --> 30:29.700
Given that he is fluent in Korean,

30:29.766 --> 30:30.700
he either a Korean,

30:31.400 --> 30:33.033
or a Korean immigrant.

30:36.366 --> 30:37.566
How do you know this?

30:37.633 --> 30:38.833
He tried to kill me in Japan

30:39.466 --> 30:40.866
because of the Seung-ryong Hong's file.

30:41.566 --> 30:43.166
Yuki, a girl who helped me,

30:43.766 --> 30:45.000
and her entire family

30:46.733 --> 30:47.766
were murdered by him.

30:48.866 --> 30:50.066
Not long ago,

30:50.966 --> 30:52.466
he assassinated Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon.

30:54.766 --> 30:56.100
Even Commissioner Gi-hoon Yeon?

30:56.333 --> 30:57.533
He must be a professional killer,

30:58.033 --> 30:59.633
part of Iris.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
If he met Mi-jeong four months ago,

31:05.766 --> 31:07.466
he must've gotten close to her on purpose.

31:08.000 --> 31:08.933
As for now,

31:09.200 --> 31:11.100
he is the most definite lead
to the whereabouts

31:11.966 --> 31:13.500
of Director Baek and Sa-woo Jin.

31:13.700 --> 31:14.633
All right.

31:15.433 --> 31:16.933
We were able to get hold of a picture,

31:17.233 --> 31:18.466
it should help tracking him down.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.033
Sir.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.166
Yes? anything more to say?

31:23.933 --> 31:25.566
I can't contact Seung-hee Choi.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.100
What do you mean you can't contact her?

31:28.666 --> 31:29.700
What are you talking about?

31:29.766 --> 31:31.300
She was together with me on Jeju Island

31:32.166 --> 31:33.500
until I got back here first,

31:33.733 --> 31:35.166
but I can't contact her till now.

31:37.966 --> 31:39.300
I have a bad feeling about this.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.766
-We should hurry and look--
-All right.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.333
I'll send an agent to Jeju Island.

31:43.633 --> 31:44.566
You,

31:44.866 --> 31:46.933
focus on tracking down
San Baek and Sa-woo Jin.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.733
The incident happened ages ago,

31:58.666 --> 32:00.633
and yet we don't even have suspects.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.166
We don't know where they went.

32:03.566 --> 32:04.833
No other evidence found.

32:05.466 --> 32:06.900
Unknown, unidentified.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.433
What in the world

32:08.866 --> 32:11.033
are the NSS and the NIS doing right now?

32:11.533 --> 32:12.700
We are working on it.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.400
We are dedicated to the search,

32:15.166 --> 32:16.200
so we will find them soon.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.100
We...

32:18.300 --> 32:22.433
know nothing about Iris in Korea.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.866
Also, ever since Commissioner
Gi-hoon Yeon's assassination,

32:26.933 --> 32:29.633
information leakage is the bigger problem.

32:30.666 --> 32:32.566
Thus, I'd like to ask you this.

32:33.100 --> 32:35.233
Wouldn't it be better to inform
North Korea

32:36.433 --> 32:38.566
about these facts and reconsider

32:38.966 --> 32:40.833
the summit discussion?

32:41.100 --> 32:42.533
What do you mean reconsider?

32:43.033 --> 32:45.400
You want me to cancel the discussion
because of these matters?

32:46.133 --> 32:48.933
I was just pointing out the fact that
we don't know anything about Iris

32:49.200 --> 32:52.166
and the danger has exacerbated.

32:52.366 --> 32:53.266
I heard that the North

32:53.800 --> 32:56.600
finished clearing out the coup force.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.133
They are done
with the situation and ready.

32:59.766 --> 33:03.100
I don't think it's necessary
to let them know

33:04.633 --> 33:05.966
that we are confused by the situation

33:06.066 --> 33:07.366
and that we are not ready.

33:07.700 --> 33:10.400
We even got past
the nuclear terror threat.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.400
Whatever assault they might make,

33:14.300 --> 33:15.933
there is nothing to be changed.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.533
Make haste

33:18.300 --> 33:20.200
in finding San Baek

33:20.433 --> 33:21.566
and reveal

33:21.633 --> 33:22.966
what they are plotting.

33:23.833 --> 33:24.766
Yes, sir.

33:32.166 --> 33:34.200
At first, three groups will infiltrate

33:34.966 --> 33:36.266
and take over the security room.

33:36.366 --> 33:39.166
Then, they'll finish setting biochemical
weapons in the air conditioning room.

33:39.233 --> 33:41.733
What kind of biochemical weapon
would be used?

33:42.433 --> 33:43.666
Soman gas will be used.

33:44.533 --> 33:47.933
The median lethal dose of soman gas is
about 2000 milligrams per kilogram.

33:48.033 --> 33:51.200
You can take a lot of lives
even with small amount.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.166
After the operations
in those rooms are finished,

33:58.500 --> 34:00.466
we will shut all exits
from the security room.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.966
Team David will gather all the hostages
towards the center.

34:04.466 --> 34:05.600
How much time estimated?

34:05.666 --> 34:06.833
Fifteen minutes is enough.

34:08.366 --> 34:09.600
What do you think?

34:12.533 --> 34:13.466
It's unreasonable.

34:15.266 --> 34:16.566
The target we chose

34:16.633 --> 34:18.733
has simple structure
and doesn't have a lot of entrances.

34:19.033 --> 34:20.633
It may seem easy to defend it,

34:21.266 --> 34:23.633
but it also makes it as difficult
to escape after the operation.

34:24.833 --> 34:25.866
On top of that,

34:26.166 --> 34:27.300
it is isolated from

34:27.366 --> 34:28.199
neighboring buildings.

34:29.133 --> 34:30.566
It will make it easy

34:30.633 --> 34:32.900
for Special Task Force and SWAT
to carry out their operations.

34:33.266 --> 34:35.033
A place with more entrances and exits

34:35.766 --> 34:37.333
and a complicated structure

34:37.766 --> 34:39.500
would benefit us more.

34:39.966 --> 34:41.366
With the current number of personnel,

34:42.533 --> 34:43.733
that would be impossible.

34:43.866 --> 34:46.933
What we need is not more people, but time.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.333
After we take over the places within time
as planned,

34:49.733 --> 34:51.733
we set booby traps on each entrance.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.766
When entering forcefully,

34:53.833 --> 34:55.433
we set biochemical weapons

34:55.500 --> 34:56.833
and warn them.

34:56.966 --> 34:58.166
It is possible.

34:59.466 --> 35:01.266
For now, we should change our target

35:01.700 --> 35:04.300
and make detailed plans again.

35:06.933 --> 35:08.500
Start from scratch.

35:34.766 --> 35:35.700
Excuse me.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.466
Step outside for a bit.

35:55.966 --> 35:56.900
I figured out that

35:57.100 --> 35:59.300
there is someone locked up
in the second basement.

36:00.166 --> 36:01.133
And the director

36:01.566 --> 36:03.133
is the only one who goes in there.

36:04.766 --> 36:05.933
Do you know who it is?

36:06.966 --> 36:08.166
No, I wasn't able to...

36:14.733 --> 36:16.166
All right. Great job.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.166
Yes.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.433
All plans are

36:33.566 --> 36:35.066
being reconsidered now.

36:37.233 --> 36:38.133
Yes.

36:38.766 --> 36:40.600
We will choose another D-day.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.866
Seung-hee Choi

36:43.100 --> 36:44.600
will be dealt with, as told.

36:46.233 --> 36:47.100
Yes.

36:48.766 --> 36:50.333
You don't have to worry about it.

37:08.266 --> 37:09.233
Come in.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.166
What is it?

37:21.733 --> 37:23.166
I have something to tell you.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.233
Sit.

37:46.666 --> 37:47.700
What do you want to tell me?

37:48.366 --> 37:49.400
To be honest,

37:51.666 --> 37:52.666
I am

37:53.833 --> 37:55.333
very confused right now.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.200
Why?

37:59.100 --> 38:00.300
I have a lot of questions,

38:02.766 --> 38:05.700
but I don't have a single answer
for any of them.

38:06.533 --> 38:07.566
Continue.

38:08.300 --> 38:10.633
I don't know my position is
in the organization.

38:11.866 --> 38:12.833
The true identity

38:13.600 --> 38:15.066
of the organization

38:15.200 --> 38:16.400
that I'm risking my life on

38:18.733 --> 38:21.833
can only be seen through you
is a burden as well.

38:22.900 --> 38:23.833
What else?

38:24.966 --> 38:26.033
I am curious about

38:27.533 --> 38:29.333
you and Seung-hee Choi.

38:30.066 --> 38:31.966
Sometimes, your consideration towards

38:32.866 --> 38:33.800
Seung-hee Choi

38:34.400 --> 38:36.100
could have even put
the organization in danger.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.633
It was that special.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.100
Why do you take her

38:43.600 --> 38:45.300
into consideration so much?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.500
My answer is simple and easy.

38:52.766 --> 38:54.200
To know only what one must know

38:54.633 --> 38:56.300
in one's current position

38:56.833 --> 39:00.266
is the reason how this giant organization
is maintained.

39:01.166 --> 39:02.333
Unnecessary questions

39:02.766 --> 39:04.366
can put you in a dangerous spot.

39:05.866 --> 39:07.966
I understand what your question is,

39:10.633 --> 39:13.400
but you don't have to be confused
as you are already

39:14.433 --> 39:15.766
in the center of the organization.

39:16.633 --> 39:17.533
And,

39:19.033 --> 39:20.466
any questions regarding Seung-hee Choi

39:21.733 --> 39:23.000
should be abandoned.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.500
This is not an advice, but a warning.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.166
If you have any feelings
for Seung-hee Choi,

39:31.966 --> 39:34.666
that is the most dangerous thing to do.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.333
Come in.

40:00.233 --> 40:01.733
Sorry to summon you while you are resting.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.600
It's fine.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.066
Sit.

40:08.533 --> 40:09.466
Few days ago,

40:09.766 --> 40:11.866
when we were investigating
on Vice-marshal Tae-joon Rhee,

40:12.133 --> 40:14.966
we caught a person connecting
Vice-marshal with Iris.

40:18.600 --> 40:19.533
In here,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.533
we have the information that we got
while investigating the man.

40:23.300 --> 40:26.100
We couldn't find out in detail
since there wasn't much to hear from him.

40:26.566 --> 40:27.633
But I believe

40:28.466 --> 40:31.433
there is another operation going on
in South Korea.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.000
This is an important matter
that can cancel the summit discussion.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.900
As I'm responsible for the security,
I can't send

40:37.966 --> 40:39.966
the President of the Supreme
People's Assembly Presidium

40:40.033 --> 40:41.766
to South Korea, knowing such danger.

40:44.666 --> 40:47.233
Sun-hwa, you should have learned a lot
about Iris

40:47.300 --> 40:48.666
while you were with Hyun-jun Kim.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.900
Before I discuss this matter
with South Korea,

40:51.500 --> 40:53.333
I want you to go through this file first.

40:56.933 --> 40:57.866
Yes, sir.

41:46.033 --> 41:53.033
SUPREME GUARD COMMAND UNIT ONE

41:56.466 --> 41:57.533
Come in.

42:02.233 --> 42:03.966
Iris has sent in armed force

42:04.400 --> 42:06.933
in attempt to rescue Director Baek
and his associates.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.333
Hasn't South Korea contacted you yet?

42:10.500 --> 42:11.533
No, they haven't.

42:11.933 --> 42:14.500
Even if it happened,
they don't have to inform us about it.

42:20.300 --> 42:21.266
I...

42:24.000 --> 42:25.566
will go to South Korea with you.

42:26.766 --> 42:28.733
Is there a reason why you suddenly
changed your mind?

42:33.800 --> 42:34.766
All right.

42:35.266 --> 42:36.666
It'll be done. Get prepared.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.366
Sir.

42:45.533 --> 42:46.666
Oh, good timing.

42:47.133 --> 42:48.233
I was about to find you.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.266
Are the results out?

42:49.333 --> 42:50.200
Ah, here.

42:53.866 --> 42:55.600
These are footprints left at the scene.

42:56.166 --> 42:58.900
They are all different sizes,
but they are the same kind.

42:59.133 --> 43:00.733
They're specially made
for military supply,

43:00.800 --> 43:02.666
manufactured by an American company,
Temitron.

43:02.766 --> 43:04.666
They're usually used for foreign dispatch

43:04.933 --> 43:07.033
or private military companies.

43:08.766 --> 43:09.700
Great work.

43:25.666 --> 43:28.733
Hey, what about the immigration records
of Mi-jeong Yang's murder suspect?

43:28.800 --> 43:30.300
We found one using facial comparison.

43:30.700 --> 43:32.633
He used the name Harry Smith
as a Canadian citizen

43:32.700 --> 43:33.933
when he was entering Korea.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.633
All right, I'll take care of this,

43:35.733 --> 43:37.066
go to Secretary Hyun-kyu Oh now.

43:37.133 --> 43:39.500
Tell him that I sent you
regarding the footprint investigation.

43:39.566 --> 43:40.400
Yes, sir.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.066
-Sir.
-Wait.

43:48.133 --> 43:49.766
How is the satellite picture analysis?

43:49.900 --> 43:51.400
This is all we have.

43:51.933 --> 43:53.566
We have pictures of them
entering the tunnel,

43:53.766 --> 43:54.766
but not leaving.

43:55.633 --> 43:56.766
So I checked,

43:57.233 --> 43:58.900
and I think they used some kind of device

43:59.000 --> 44:00.700
to jam the satellite signal.

44:01.333 --> 44:04.066
It is impossible to get more data
from this point.

44:04.533 --> 44:06.733
Using the algorithm for Steiner tree,

44:07.100 --> 44:10.433
we can only make lists of possible routes
of their escape.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.666
Then work on this first.

44:14.900 --> 44:15.766
What is it?

44:15.833 --> 44:17.933
It's the immigration record
for Mi-jeong's murder suspect.

44:18.066 --> 44:19.400
He probably used a fake passport.

44:19.466 --> 44:21.933
See if there are other immigration records

44:22.233 --> 44:23.466
and check the relationship between

44:23.533 --> 44:24.733
the cycle of immigration

44:24.800 --> 44:26.266
and the countries he's been to.

44:26.900 --> 44:28.100
All right.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.466
What is it?

44:31.400 --> 44:32.833
I got this while analyzing the pictures

44:32.966 --> 44:34.200
on Mi-jeong's blog.

44:34.933 --> 44:36.000
Take a look.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.166
It's a bottle of wine.

44:39.533 --> 44:40.366
So what?

44:40.433 --> 44:41.300
Mi-jeong

44:41.366 --> 44:42.866
never drinks wine.

44:46.766 --> 44:49.333
The tag shows that
it was legally imported.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.666
These were limited edition
only sold to collectors.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.500
Try tracking down the importer
and the buyer.

44:58.900 --> 44:59.766
Yes, sir.

45:09.133 --> 45:11.400
What happened?
Your phone was off the whole time!

45:13.833 --> 45:14.833
After Mi-jeong died,

45:15.266 --> 45:17.700
we were worried that something happened
to you too.

45:18.166 --> 45:19.200
Mi-jeong is dead?

45:19.333 --> 45:22.566
She is killed by a suspect
who is thought to be a part of Iris.

45:38.233 --> 45:39.200
What is this all about?

45:39.700 --> 45:40.600
I'm sorry.

45:40.666 --> 45:41.866
No. What happened?

45:43.333 --> 45:44.733
It's...

45:45.933 --> 45:47.166
difficult to tell you now.

45:48.333 --> 45:49.533
Well, nothing happened,

45:50.100 --> 45:51.333
and I'm back in one shape.

45:51.966 --> 45:52.833
Just...

45:53.500 --> 45:55.000
just understand it, please.

45:57.866 --> 45:58.833
Seung-hee Choi!

45:59.866 --> 46:01.266
Where were you the whole time?

46:01.766 --> 46:02.733
I'm sorry.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.066
I'll listen to your excuse later.

46:05.100 --> 46:06.766
Analyze this and start profiling for now.

46:08.000 --> 46:08.900
Yes, sir.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.200
We don't have time. Do it fast.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.966
I have to take care of this now.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.033
Is the Director

47:11.500 --> 47:12.433
okay?

47:13.333 --> 47:14.266
Yes.

47:15.133 --> 47:16.266
Where is he now?

47:16.733 --> 47:18.300
I can't tell you that.

47:19.633 --> 47:21.533
If you have something to tell him,
I'll pass it on.

47:32.066 --> 47:33.200
These are the documents

47:33.466 --> 47:34.833
that the Director asked for.

48:04.900 --> 48:07.800
My answer is simple and easy.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.566
To know only what one must know

48:11.066 --> 48:12.633
in one's current position

48:13.233 --> 48:16.766
is the reason how this giant organization
is maintained.

48:17.633 --> 48:18.833
Unnecessary questions

48:19.333 --> 48:20.833
can put you in a dangerous spot.

48:21.666 --> 48:22.600
And,

48:23.233 --> 48:24.766
any questions regarding Seung-hee Choi

48:25.900 --> 48:27.066
should be abandoned.

48:28.933 --> 48:30.566
This is not an advice, but a warning.

48:32.366 --> 48:34.300
If you have any feelings
for Seung-hee Choi,

48:36.066 --> 48:38.700
that is the most dangerous thing to do.

48:47.100 --> 48:48.066
Freeze.

48:54.133 --> 48:55.100
Shoot.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.166
Just like how you shot Hyun-jun,

48:57.866 --> 48:59.066
shoot me too!

49:00.066 --> 49:01.000
Seung-hee...

49:26.033 --> 49:27.466
I've checked the analyzed data.

49:28.133 --> 49:29.633
Specifying the weapons, contact gadgets

49:30.033 --> 49:31.833
and tactics used at the field,

49:31.900 --> 49:32.800
we should

49:32.866 --> 49:34.766
list up private military companies
primarily.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.466
Talk to me for a second.

49:38.533 --> 49:39.600
Let's talk about it later.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.266
I'm...

49:49.500 --> 49:50.600
Answer the phone.

49:51.333 --> 49:52.333
No. It's all right.

49:56.066 --> 49:57.566
If you really don't want to talk about it,

49:58.600 --> 49:59.766
I won't ask anymore.

50:04.066 --> 50:05.466
But I have one question.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.100
When you were caught hostage,

50:08.233 --> 50:09.666
Do-chul Kang, the one interrogating you,

50:11.400 --> 50:14.233
just let you go after a phone call
from somewhere.

50:18.900 --> 50:20.466
Don't you want to know why

50:20.600 --> 50:21.766
you were freed safely?

50:25.400 --> 50:26.966
I, too, found that curious,

50:27.866 --> 50:29.100
but I can't seem to know why.

50:38.266 --> 50:39.500
After what happened to Mi-jeong,

50:40.100 --> 50:41.733
I was worried something bad like that

50:41.900 --> 50:43.233
would happen to you too.

50:45.933 --> 50:47.700
The opponents are Director Baek
and Sa-woo.

50:49.166 --> 50:50.100
They can both

50:52.366 --> 50:54.333
be targeting you.

50:59.066 --> 50:59.966
I'll let you work.

51:21.966 --> 51:23.700
Chief Presidential Secretary
Hyung-jun Jung and

51:23.766 --> 51:25.600
Chief Spokesperson Su-jin Hong
have just arrived.

51:27.100 --> 51:27.966
Let them in.

51:40.133 --> 51:41.133
Yes, this is Hyun-jun Kim.

51:41.300 --> 51:42.366
It's me.

51:44.166 --> 51:45.366
I'm in Seoul right now.

51:46.166 --> 51:48.233
I came here with the summit discussion
delegation team.

51:48.966 --> 51:50.366
We need to meet.

51:53.933 --> 51:55.566
I heard you became the head

51:56.166 --> 51:58.166
of the summit discussion delegation team?

51:58.766 --> 52:01.466
Yes. I happen to take an important role
by chance.

52:02.733 --> 52:05.566
How is the investigation regarding
San Baek and Sa-woo Jin going?

52:06.333 --> 52:08.300
Well, we are trying to figure things out,

52:08.933 --> 52:11.166
but there isn't a definite lead
to solve the problem.

52:12.366 --> 52:13.400
In my opinion,

52:13.466 --> 52:14.966
they are probably working on a tactic

52:15.066 --> 52:16.766
to stop the summit discussion.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.333
While we were

52:18.766 --> 52:20.766
investigating some people
related to the coup.

52:21.800 --> 52:22.700
we found some Iris--

52:22.766 --> 52:23.766
Wait a moment.

52:28.633 --> 52:29.800
Could you

52:30.300 --> 52:31.466
give us some space?

52:32.166 --> 52:33.066
Pardon?

52:33.666 --> 52:36.533
Oh, I have something personal
to talk about.

52:45.333 --> 52:46.266
Yes, sir.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.200
Please continue.

53:03.033 --> 53:03.933
It's me.

53:05.266 --> 53:06.366
Chul-young Park

53:06.800 --> 53:08.233
must have figured something out.

53:09.533 --> 53:11.666
And he is saying it

53:12.166 --> 53:13.600
to Secretary Hyung-jun Jung right now.

53:15.833 --> 53:16.800
Yes.

53:18.533 --> 53:19.700
Secretary Hyung-jun Jung

53:20.333 --> 53:21.566
is doubting me.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.466
While investigating the people
involved with the coup,

53:25.866 --> 53:27.733
we found a file regarding Iris.

53:28.933 --> 53:30.600
I analyzed the document,

53:32.033 --> 53:33.033
and there was

53:33.766 --> 53:35.566
Seung-hee Choi being mentioned.

53:40.133 --> 53:41.166
Seung-hee?

53:41.233 --> 53:43.433
I believe Iris is targeting

53:44.500 --> 53:46.700
Seung-hee Choi to eliminate.

53:48.100 --> 53:49.233
I think that

53:50.300 --> 53:51.733
Seung-hee Choi is in danger.

53:59.733 --> 54:00.633
Well,

54:00.933 --> 54:02.500
I'll inform the president

54:02.633 --> 54:03.833
and discuss it.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.666
If we must change the schedule
of the summit discussion,

54:06.733 --> 54:08.200
please let us know as soon as possible.

54:09.066 --> 54:10.133
I will.

56:05.833 --> 56:06.766
No!

56:08.833 --> 56:11.333
He's our only lead to track down
San Baek and Sa-woo Jin.

56:12.266 --> 56:13.266
We must chase after him.

57:05.633 --> 57:07.033
I don't know what to do.

57:11.233 --> 57:12.266
Hug me.

57:27.766 --> 57:29.400
I thought you were an NSS agent.

57:29.966 --> 57:31.766
Why did you become a terrorist?

57:34.766 --> 57:36.566
I don't think I can go back
to the old days.

57:38.966 --> 57:43.200
Forget everything about me, Seung-hee.

57:56.200 --> 57:57.200
Tell me.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.766
What happened.

58:04.133 --> 58:05.933
I'm sorry.

58:06.700 --> 58:07.566
I...

58:08.000 --> 58:09.366
couldn't tell you that

58:10.300 --> 58:11.633
Seung-hee was alive.

58:12.733 --> 58:13.766
Sa-woo.

58:25.833 --> 58:27.066
Why did you change so much?
