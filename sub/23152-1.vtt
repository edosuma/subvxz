01:05.200 --> 01:05.980
Hello.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.100
Johannes Brandt?

01:26.460 --> 01:27.940
Are we to have a menagerie?

01:29.900 --> 01:33.130
Er, his name is Peebo.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.810
He's a parakeet.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.210
I'm Nella.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.170
Short for Petronella.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.720
Are you the housekeeper?

01:46.020 --> 01:47.540
Where is Johannes?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.910
My brother is not at home.

01:51.460 --> 01:55.210
Your brother? So you are...

01:55.260 --> 01:56.740
Marin Brandt.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.500
Otto!

02:13.660 --> 02:14.900
For your feet.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.650
Otto is my brother's manservant.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.490
This is Cornelia, she is the maid.

02:28.540 --> 02:32.770
They will look after
you. This is Petronella.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.660
She is the Seigneur's new wife.

02:35.660 --> 02:37.980
I expect you'll want to see your bedroom.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.860
To the kitchen.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.580
Oh, he lives with, um...

02:54.460 --> 02:55.900
Come on!

03:08.020 --> 03:10.450
This used to be my room.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.570
But it had the better
view, so we gave it to you.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.530
Oh, no, please, you must keep it.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.890
No, you misunderstand.

03:18.940 --> 03:21.770
The view is of you.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.380
Amsterdammers must see that
Johannes Brandt has a new wife.

03:29.260 --> 03:35.380
The Oortmans' grand ancestral
seat, is it warm and dry?

03:36.940 --> 03:39.010
It's not that grand...

03:39.060 --> 03:40.460
.. and it's damp.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.810
We couldn't afford to maintain the dykes.

03:45.860 --> 03:48.850
Pedigree counts for nothing.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.180
Nothing.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.860
The dykes must be maintained
or the waters will rise.

03:58.460 --> 04:02.250
We sent the second-best barge.
I hope you weren't offended.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.370
Johannes was using the other one.

04:04.420 --> 04:10.020
No, of course not. Did
he know I was coming?

04:11.060 --> 04:13.170
You must be hungry.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.820
I'll have Cornelia bring
you something to eat.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.820
Oh, do you have any marzipan?

04:20.980 --> 04:23.410
We do not keep sugar in the house.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.700
The luxury of it sickens the soul.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.660
Cornelia will bring you a herring.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.140
Be still, girl! He'll be here any moment!

05:01.620 --> 05:05.210
Now you listen to me, my
girl. You need to marry him.

05:05.260 --> 05:08.690
You need to make him want to marry
you, otherwise we are ruined.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.130
For myself, I don't care.

05:10.180 --> 05:12.980
- But for your brother and sister...
- He's coming! He's coming!

05:17.540 --> 05:20.090
And this is Nella...

05:20.140 --> 05:22.740
Petronella, I mean.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.180
Your daughter is very
beautiful, Madame Oortman.

05:35.180 --> 05:37.860
- How bad are the debts, exactly?
- The debts?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.650
I know I was not the
only one you wrote to.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.620
You would not have done so
had you not been desperate.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.420
Did I mention she plays the lute?

05:50.820 --> 05:55.010
Praise God, we are saved.
He has asked for your hand.

05:55.060 --> 05:56.810
Do you think you could love him?

05:56.860 --> 05:59.860
- Does it make a difference?
- No. But I want you to be happy.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.100
I think perhaps I could.

06:07.140 --> 06:11.290
I hear they eat chocolate
wrapped in gold in Amsterdam!

06:11.340 --> 06:12.650
Come, come.

06:49.140 --> 06:51.130
She's here.

06:51.180 --> 06:55.060
It would have looked better if
you'd been here when she arrived.

06:59.940 --> 07:01.660
Perhaps you should go and see her.

07:04.580 --> 07:06.690
No, let her sleep.

07:06.740 --> 07:08.740
- You have to understand...
- I understand.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.220
I have to work. Rzecki, come.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.850
That's right, although,
Hamburg's a good choice

07:47.900 --> 07:49.020
And Marseilles...

07:54.700 --> 07:56.490
Good morning!

07:56.540 --> 07:57.620
Good morning.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.290
Thank you for my dress.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.300
There are more.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.250
It's a little large.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.540
Marin, don't you think?

08:10.820 --> 08:14.340
Never mind, we'll have it
altered. Come and eat something.

08:30.900 --> 08:34.250
We are eating frugally today
to demonstrate humility.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.650
Privation as a thrill, you
mean. Otto, get me some beer.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.169
And Nella and Marin too.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.530
It gives me indigestion.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.929
Go on, be defiant!

08:43.980 --> 08:47.020
Bravery is the rarest commodity
in the city these days.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.610
- How was the voyage?
- Not much to tell.

08:52.660 --> 08:55.810
- The Lombardy silk, who won
the import rights? - I forget.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.690
- Who?
- Henry Field of London.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.690
The English, always the English.
Think of the commission, Johannes.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.850
I know what I'm doing, Marin.
This house is evidence enough, no?

09:04.900 --> 09:07.570
Have you spoken to Frans Meermans
yet about his wife's sugar?

09:07.620 --> 09:09.010
So that's what this is about.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.970
It's been sitting in the
warehouse for a month.

09:11.020 --> 09:13.290
You still haven't told them
what you plan to do with it.

09:13.340 --> 09:15.610
My sister thinks that
sugar rots the soul, Nella,

09:15.660 --> 09:17.970
but of all the things I
might sell, she pushes this.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.970
- What do you make of that?
- Sell the sugar!

09:20.020 --> 09:21.140
Don't tell me what to do!

09:29.020 --> 09:31.490
- Where are you going?
- To check on your damned sugar!

09:31.540 --> 09:32.820
I don't believe you.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.040
Hello!

09:52.580 --> 09:55.730
Did Johannes collect these on his travels?

09:55.780 --> 09:58.210
The world in a set of plates.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.760
Isn't he rich enough to
have someone travel for him?

10:01.860 --> 10:04.890
The Seigneur's spirit belongs on the seas.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.250
He says the ocean is something
the land can never be.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.300
No patch ever stays the same.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.580
What are you doing?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.330
Only talking.

10:15.380 --> 10:18.890
He's working. Can't you see?

10:18.940 --> 10:20.450
Leave that.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.740
There are scrolls you need to deliver.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.850
Marin, I think Peebo misses me.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.610
He needs fresh air and light.

10:35.660 --> 10:38.170
His place is down here.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.330
- But Johannes' dog...
- Johannes is the Seigneur.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.980
He may do as he pleases.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.980
Is he away a great deal?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.940
Nobody forced you to marry him.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.820
Johannes...

11:36.100 --> 11:37.930
I just wondered,

11:37.980 --> 11:41.540
will I see you...

11:43.900 --> 11:45.540
.. later?

11:49.700 --> 11:51.180
Tonight...

11:55.660 --> 11:57.380
Tonight, I cannot.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.900
Soon, then?

12:06.580 --> 12:08.860
Nella...

12:16.780 --> 12:20.300
.. good night, sweet girl.

12:29.140 --> 12:32.210
I have now been in
Amsterdam for over a week.

12:32.260 --> 12:36.090
The city is a glory, like
nothing I have ever experienced.

12:36.140 --> 12:40.050
My new home is beautiful, and
I want for no material thing.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.210
"He is like a man which built a house

12:43.260 --> 12:46.250
"and laid the foundations upon a rock."

12:46.300 --> 12:50.450
Johannes's sister Marin is very godly,

12:50.500 --> 12:53.330
and takes great interest in our diet.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.540
".. built his house upon the earth."

13:00.980 --> 13:03.170
As for Johannes,

13:03.220 --> 13:05.490
he treats me with great kindness,

13:05.540 --> 13:08.690
but his work takes him away a great deal.

13:08.740 --> 13:11.780
I look forward to spending
more time with him.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.770
I hope the dykes are holding.

13:18.820 --> 13:20.770
Please send my love to little...

13:23.740 --> 13:25.610
Be quiet!

13:25.660 --> 13:30.410
My God, Johannes, what have you done?

13:30.460 --> 13:33.730
- What? You told me to find a...
- A what?

13:33.780 --> 13:37.260
A wedding gift. For you.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.650
A man at the docks had
some cabinets left over.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.620
I had it improved with
tortoiseshell and pewter inlays.

13:55.780 --> 13:57.410
But what is it?

13:57.460 --> 14:01.330
A house. Your house.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.420
This house.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.530
- How much?
- The frame was 2,000.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.490
Curtains and furnishings
brought it to three.

14:10.540 --> 14:14.650
3,000 guilders? A family
could live on that for years.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.930
If you had money to spare, you
should have given it to the Church.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.590
Enough of your piety.

14:20.340 --> 14:24.060
Well, she doesn't like it. Neither do I.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.700
That's a bitch's taste for you.

14:35.340 --> 14:36.890
What about you?

14:36.940 --> 14:39.570
I hoped you might like it.

14:39.620 --> 14:43.770
What am I to do with it, exactly?

14:43.820 --> 14:45.420
You'll think of something.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.500
What are you doing?

15:06.420 --> 15:09.890
Nothing. Your door was open.

15:09.940 --> 15:11.620
I thought you'd prefer it closed.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.770
Smit's List.

15:20.820 --> 15:24.740
It's a register of all the crafts
people and businesses in the city.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.330
What for?

15:28.380 --> 15:30.490
To decorate your house.

15:30.540 --> 15:33.820
My brother will pay for everything.

15:36.580 --> 15:39.490
I thought you said it was an extravagance.

15:39.540 --> 15:42.260
The Devil finds work for idle hands.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.210
Miniaturist.

15:49.260 --> 15:52.290
Trained with the great Bruges
clockmaker Lucas Windelbreke.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.090
At the sign of the sun.

15:54.140 --> 15:57.890
"Dear Sir, I have a house of
nine rooms, on a miniature scale,

15:57.940 --> 16:00.210
"that is to be displayed in a cabinet.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.770
"I venture three requests to
you and await your response.

16:03.820 --> 16:06.890
"Item -- one lute with strings.

16:06.940 --> 16:10.690
"Item -- one cage,
suitable for a parakeet.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.940
"Item -- one box of marzipan."

16:14.340 --> 16:16.140
How do I get to the Kalverstraat?

16:17.420 --> 16:19.490
What do you want there?

16:19.540 --> 16:22.770
Nothing. To leave a message for someone.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.490
Who?

16:24.540 --> 16:27.220
A craftsman, that's all.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.090
I'll come with you, Madame.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.620
There's no need. I have a
good sense of direction.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.220
Why didn't Otto come?

16:44.380 --> 16:47.180
- It's not easy for him.
- What do you mean?

16:48.540 --> 16:53.850
He was on a Portuguese
slave ship. 16 years old.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.690
His parents were dead.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.810
The Seigneur saw him and bought him.

16:58.860 --> 17:01.130
You're saying he's a slave.

17:01.180 --> 17:04.180
No. But he owes the Seigneur his life.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.770
Oh, Marzipan! Do you
think we can get some?

17:11.819 --> 17:14.619
- Come on, Madame.
- Cornflower! Where've you been?

17:15.940 --> 17:18.619
Well, what you waiting for? Come in!

17:21.859 --> 17:24.780
Please, Madame, have a look around.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.410
The Meermans insisted the
Seigneur distribute it.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.490
They know he can get a
better price abroad.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.290
And Madame's all for it,
even though she hates sugar.

17:36.340 --> 17:38.410
Her and all the rest of the killjoys!

17:38.460 --> 17:41.290
I heard a rumour they want to
ban gingerbread men as papist --

17:41.340 --> 17:42.540
can you believe that?

17:44.300 --> 17:46.300
Madame, try anything you like.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.330
Why not sell it here?

17:50.380 --> 17:52.250
There's barely enough to go round.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.010
I think there's more going on.

17:54.060 --> 17:56.100
More? What do you mean...?

17:57.540 --> 18:00.890
Hanna! What are you doing, woman?

18:00.940 --> 18:03.540
I must go. I'll see you soon, Cornflower.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.980
There it is.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.530
The sign of the sun.

18:16.580 --> 18:18.380
I've never noticed that before...

18:21.420 --> 18:22.900
Hello?

18:24.340 --> 18:25.980
Hello?

18:46.540 --> 18:48.290
Madame!

18:48.340 --> 18:50.540
I don't think there's anyone here, Madame.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.540
What happened to the cabinet?

19:25.700 --> 19:28.170
It couldn't stay in the hallway.

19:28.220 --> 19:30.220
It was taking up all the light.

19:59.180 --> 20:01.370
Otto! Cornelia! The door.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.620
Hello.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.650
What the hell are you doing here?

20:21.700 --> 20:25.250
A package. For Nella Oortman.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.020
So, this is your new wife?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.380
Jack Philips, Madame.

20:33.220 --> 20:35.180
Next time, use the lower entrance.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.940
Who was it, Seigneur?

20:41.100 --> 20:42.580
No-one, Otto. No-one.

20:44.140 --> 20:46.300
A delivery, that's all.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.300
What is it in the parcel?

20:53.820 --> 20:56.380
Just some things for the
cabinet you bought me.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.420
"Every woman is the architect
of her own fortune."

21:23.420 --> 21:25.820
Item -- one lute with strings.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.860
Item -- one cage, suitable for a parakeet.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.140
Item -- one box of marzipan.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.850
"Sir, I thank you for
the items I requested.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.890
"Your craftsmanship is exceptional.

23:08.940 --> 23:10.690
"However, I made no request for a cradle,

23:10.740 --> 23:13.450
"nor do I understand why
you would wish to send one.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.210
"I must therefore curtail
our transactions forthwith.

23:16.260 --> 23:18.340
"Yours in good faith, Petronella Brandt."

23:27.020 --> 23:28.930
For the craftsman again?

23:28.980 --> 23:31.420
- Don't open it.
- No, Madame.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.410
There you are. But where
on earth is Cornelia?

23:40.460 --> 23:42.050
You need to start getting ready.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.650
Ready? For what?

23:43.700 --> 23:46.610
Johannes is taking you to a feast
at the Guild of Silversmiths.

23:46.660 --> 23:48.650
Why are the curtains closed?

23:48.700 --> 23:51.810
The sunlight was too bright, that's all.

23:51.860 --> 23:54.620
We keep them open during the daylight.

23:58.700 --> 24:02.490
Otherwise people will think
we have something to hide.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.780
The feast.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.970
Was it his idea?

24:08.020 --> 24:10.660
We agreed it was appropriate
you should attend.

24:17.140 --> 24:18.500
You look wonderful.

24:21.540 --> 24:25.380
See, Marin, all that money I spent
on dresses was worth it after all.

24:27.140 --> 24:29.090
Why aren't you coming?

24:29.140 --> 24:32.690
I think it is better you're
seen with your wife, don't you?

24:32.740 --> 24:35.410
You must remember to invite
the Meermans to dinner.

24:35.460 --> 24:37.300
All right. Nella, let's go.

24:49.340 --> 24:53.260
Thank you... for bringing me.

24:54.940 --> 24:58.490
You don't have to thank me.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.810
Then whom should I thank?

25:00.860 --> 25:02.890
I mean, you're my wife.

25:02.940 --> 25:05.780
You shouldn't have to thank
me for taking you somewhere.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.090
Will the Meermans be there?

25:10.140 --> 25:14.690
Marin seems very keen for you
to sell Frans Meermans' sugar.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.780
It's not his.

25:17.940 --> 25:19.380
It's his wife's.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.730
She sees it as a passport to
what she's always wanted --

25:25.780 --> 25:28.570
the power and position
Frans couldn't give her --

25:28.620 --> 25:31.180
but Marin doesn't understand
the complications.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.220
Which are?

25:35.260 --> 25:39.060
Exactly what he and Agnes will do
with the power once they have it.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.540
Turn around.

25:59.900 --> 26:01.660
Close your eyes.

26:16.780 --> 26:19.220
Smile, and don't say anything.

26:23.380 --> 26:26.460
The Guilds have monopoly on
trade, and set the prices.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.130
The silversmiths' is one of the richest.

26:32.180 --> 26:34.730
For a merchant like me, who
works outside the guilds,

26:34.780 --> 26:37.860
attendance is not simply a
mark of respect, but a duty.

26:48.180 --> 26:49.740
Here.

27:05.260 --> 27:09.420
Did you ever think food is
where we truly find ourselves?

27:11.700 --> 27:13.050
You see this?

27:13.100 --> 27:15.650
Cumin seeds studding a new cheese

27:15.700 --> 27:18.260
remind me I am capable of delight.

27:22.900 --> 27:27.100
Delft butter, so fine and creamy...

27:28.340 --> 27:29.620
Figs...

27:33.780 --> 27:39.420
.. and sour cream, taking
me back to childhood...

27:42.060 --> 27:44.580
.. only the taste of which I now remember.

27:49.540 --> 27:50.820
You?

27:52.620 --> 27:55.860
My mother used to make
marzipan into rolls.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.980
And the smell coming from the kitchen...

28:02.460 --> 28:03.980
.. it made my heart race.

28:05.260 --> 28:06.780
Better than herrings.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.460
What do you eat out at sea?

28:15.940 --> 28:17.330
Other men.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.430
BAH!

28:31.300 --> 28:32.980
Johannes! Over here!

28:35.380 --> 28:37.460
Business. Won't be long.

28:43.740 --> 28:47.850
I see Brandt keeps the same standard
of wife as he does everything else.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.450
Agnes Meermans.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.690
Petronella, isn't it?

28:51.740 --> 28:55.530
Now tell me, however did Marin find you?

28:55.580 --> 28:59.450
Marin? What do you mean?

28:59.500 --> 29:04.490
A bride for Johannes. She's
been searching for so long.

29:04.540 --> 29:08.260
They're so close, of
course, brother and sister.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.300
- Sometimes we wondered if...
- Agnes, please...

29:14.660 --> 29:17.850
Frans, this is Petronella Brandt.

29:17.900 --> 29:20.900
Oh, I thought she was a silversmith.

29:22.100 --> 29:24.610
Where's Johannes? I thought
we were going to talk to him.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.810
- Here he comes.
- Madame Meermans.

29:26.860 --> 29:31.090
Seigneur. I see you are working
your usual magic this evening.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.330
No magic, Madame. Just me.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.930
- About the sugar, Johannes.
- I have it in hand.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.730
We never doubted.

29:38.780 --> 29:42.130
Only, er, when will it sell, do you think?

29:42.180 --> 29:43.730
To get the best price takes time.

29:43.780 --> 29:45.730
What with the black markets in the east,

29:45.780 --> 29:48.210
and the adulterers at home,
people are craving good product.

29:48.260 --> 29:50.130
But I will not take
your sugar to the bourse.

29:50.180 --> 29:52.450
The trading floor is a
circus, the market rigged.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.770
You intend to sell it abroad?

29:54.820 --> 29:56.850
I sail to Venice shortly.

29:56.900 --> 29:58.180
Papists?

29:59.500 --> 30:01.850
Of course, if you prefer, we can
dump it all here in Amsterdam,

30:01.900 --> 30:05.490
flood the market, and realise only a quarter
of its true value. The choice is entirely yours.

30:05.540 --> 30:09.530
- You're the expert.
- Yes, I am.

30:09.580 --> 30:12.050
Come, Agnes. There's Slabbaert.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.210
We should say hello.

30:14.260 --> 30:15.500
God be with you.

30:17.180 --> 30:18.460
And you.

30:25.060 --> 30:27.130
Who are they?

30:27.180 --> 30:31.780
Schout and Schepenbank. Judge
and jury here in Amsterdam.

30:33.220 --> 30:35.570
Why do they look at you like that?

30:35.620 --> 30:37.690
Because they don't control me.

30:37.740 --> 30:40.740
Do they want to? Control you?

30:42.340 --> 30:44.690
No.

30:44.740 --> 30:46.700
They want to destroy me.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.650
You must be tired. Go to bed.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.290
I'm...

31:01.340 --> 31:04.620
.. not tired, Johannes.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.260
Still...

31:12.060 --> 31:14.620
.. I have to make notes
on the men I met tonight.

31:31.780 --> 31:33.450
What do you want?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.380
What do you think I want, Johannes?

31:38.380 --> 31:40.490
I want to be your wife.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.730
You are my wife.

31:42.780 --> 31:46.540
No. As far as I can tell I'm just...

31:47.940 --> 31:49.380
.. someone you own.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.900
Someone who's useful to you for
purposes I can only guess at.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.530
Like a dog, like Otto.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.300
- Nella, please...
- I've been here 11 days, Johannes.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.900
Longer than it took God to make the world.

32:10.540 --> 32:13.650
Until tonight, you've barely spoken to me.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.660
You're right.

32:16.980 --> 32:20.060
I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.900
Come.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.250
Do I disgust you that much?

33:26.300 --> 33:27.810
You do not disgust me.

33:27.860 --> 33:31.300
- You cannot bear me to touch you.
- It's not that.

33:32.980 --> 33:36.820
I have to share you with her. Is that it?

33:42.460 --> 33:45.570
I think you'd better leave before one
of us says something we both regret.

33:45.620 --> 33:48.170
- No, no, Johannes, I know...
- Go. Get out!

34:15.340 --> 34:16.650
Oh, no.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.050
Come on, Madame. You can't
stay in bed all day.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.370
Madame Marin wants us

34:20.420 --> 34:24.409
all to go to church to hear
Pastor Pellicorne preach.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.610
And there's something for you.

34:26.659 --> 34:30.130
It must be from the artisan.
Whatever it was you ordered.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.940
But I didn't order anything.

34:33.219 --> 34:36.420
Well, then. All the more reason
to find out what's inside.

36:02.420 --> 36:05.740
Look! They brought the savage.

36:19.420 --> 36:22.420
Seigneur, Madame Meermans.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.260
Where is your brother?

36:26.380 --> 36:28.740
Did Johannes invite you to dine with us?

36:30.420 --> 36:32.210
No, he did not.

36:32.260 --> 36:34.100
But you will come, won't you?

36:35.420 --> 36:38.700
Shouldn't his wife be the one
who issues the invitation?

36:40.140 --> 36:42.860
Please, do come tomorrow.

36:45.140 --> 36:46.660
We would be honoured.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.700
Come, let us take our place.

36:58.340 --> 37:03.570
Adultery! Usury! Fornication!

37:03.620 --> 37:09.530
And fouler deeds, too degraded
to name in God's house!

37:09.580 --> 37:14.130
Do I talk of Sodom? Of Gomorrah?

37:14.180 --> 37:17.890
No, I speak of Amsterdam!

37:17.940 --> 37:23.170
A city of closed doors,
through which no man can see.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.650
Nella! Please!

37:25.700 --> 37:27.370
But God sees!

37:27.420 --> 37:30.490
For too long we have tolerated
the iniquities of our fellow men.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.770
But a storm is coming.

37:33.820 --> 37:35.170
So...

37:35.220 --> 37:41.810
.. look now into your own hearts

37:41.860 --> 37:46.050
and the hearts of your neighbours,

37:46.100 --> 37:50.260
and consider how you have sinned.

37:51.380 --> 37:53.700
Marin. Marin, are you quite well?

37:55.020 --> 37:58.700
Husbands, love your wives.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.660
Only two of them.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.820
What are you doing?

39:39.220 --> 39:41.010
Where did you get these?

39:41.060 --> 39:44.410
A miniaturist. I don't know their name.

39:44.460 --> 39:47.050
Marin gave me Smit's List.
It was the only one in there.

39:47.100 --> 39:50.130
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.610
But you ordered these.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.450
No. No, I didn't order these.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.410
I only ordered the lute,
the cage and the marzipan.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.410
These just... came.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.450
How did they know what to make?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.370
I don't know.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.820
No more.

40:07.060 --> 40:08.970
No more, you understand?

40:09.520 --> 40:11.700
I think you're forgetting your place.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.810
What is that?

40:15.860 --> 40:17.490
As a servant.

40:17.540 --> 40:21.500
My place is to protect this house,
and all in it, including you.

40:28.540 --> 40:31.580
We stand or fall together.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.050
A wonderful sermon from
Pastor Pellicorne on Sunday,

40:43.100 --> 40:44.770
don't you think?

40:45.820 --> 40:49.090
Oh, but of course, you
missed it, Johannes.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.180
Let me guess.

40:51.220 --> 40:53.290
He offers absolution for your own sins,

40:53.340 --> 40:56.530
but only if you confess
those of your neighbours.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.930
Shall we try the sugar?

40:59.980 --> 41:01.340
Cornelia?

41:11.460 --> 41:13.060
Allow me.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.340
Exquisite.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.140
Cornelia, Otto, what do you think?

42:03.740 --> 42:06.500
Very good, Seigneur. Delicious.

42:14.020 --> 42:15.370
Mmm!

42:15.420 --> 42:20.170
God be thanked, you're going
to make our fortunes, Brandt!

42:20.220 --> 42:21.850
When do you go to Venice?

42:21.900 --> 42:23.570
I'll be gone within the month.

42:23.620 --> 42:25.970
I have to know.

42:26.020 --> 42:28.810
What did Brandt get you
for a wedding gift?

42:28.860 --> 42:31.370
I want one of my own.

42:31.420 --> 42:33.930
And I want mine to be better than hers.

42:33.980 --> 42:38.100
Thank the Lord they've gone.
Clear up in the morning.

43:27.780 --> 43:31.740
- If you had only consented...
- Why should I...

45:07.540 --> 45:11.450
"My darling, I love you
like the ever-changing sea,

45:11.500 --> 45:14.170
"always different, and always moving

45:14.220 --> 45:17.450
"You are sunlight through a
window which I stand in, warmed.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.730
"One touch lasts a thousand hours.

45:19.780 --> 45:21.730
"I love you from the
bottom of my heart..."

45:21.780 --> 45:22.980
Give it to me.

45:25.140 --> 45:27.860
Marin, I'm sorry.

45:28.940 --> 45:31.140
I said give it to me.

45:32.580 --> 45:34.730
Marin, Marin, let go of me.

45:34.780 --> 45:36.970
Marin, you're hurting me!

45:37.020 --> 45:39.740
Get out! Johannes will hear of this!

46:19.540 --> 46:21.490
Where is everyone?

46:21.540 --> 46:24.690
Madame Marin is unwell. I took
her her breakfast, but she...

46:24.740 --> 46:26.370
And Johannes?

46:26.420 --> 46:29.170
He left early for his office.

46:29.220 --> 46:32.660
No! Tell me! Where did he go last night?

46:33.820 --> 46:36.930
He didn't come back! And
why is Marin so worried?

46:36.980 --> 46:39.740
I told you. He went to his office.

46:41.860 --> 46:45.930
No. No, you're lying to me.

46:45.980 --> 46:49.930
Where are you going, Madame?
It isn't even eight o'clock!

46:49.980 --> 46:52.290
You should stay here.

46:52.340 --> 46:54.860
I can go wherever I want.

46:56.900 --> 46:59.900
Otto! Otto!

47:49.140 --> 47:50.700
Johannes.

48:11.380 --> 48:12.900
Oh!

48:28.660 --> 48:30.980
No, stop it, stop...

48:40.980 --> 48:42.580
I brought your creature.

48:43.980 --> 48:47.490
There are rose water wafers
with cinnamon and ginger.

48:47.540 --> 48:48.890
Cornelia made them specially.

48:48.940 --> 48:52.210
- You think you can bribe me?
- You haven't eaten in three days.

48:52.260 --> 48:55.890
- Because you drugged me.
- You were beside yourself.

48:55.940 --> 48:58.050
I will not be your prisoner.

48:58.100 --> 49:00.770
Don't be ridiculous. Eat.
And then we can talk.

49:00.820 --> 49:04.090
Enough of your orders,
Marin. I understand it all.

49:04.140 --> 49:05.580
Your brother is...

49:07.380 --> 49:09.060
.. is a sodomite.

49:13.220 --> 49:15.660
He is unlike most husbands, it's true.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.180
You knew?

49:23.900 --> 49:25.250
You all knew.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.850
Dear God, I am your fool.

49:27.900 --> 49:30.340
I have been a fool from
the moment I arrived here.

49:32.100 --> 49:34.130
We never laughed at you. Ever.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.290
You knew he would never love me.

49:36.340 --> 49:37.850
He likes you.

49:37.900 --> 49:41.620
Like a pet. Like the dog,
Rzecki, only less so.

49:43.180 --> 49:45.010
It's true, isn't it?

49:45.060 --> 49:48.410
He thinks less of me than his dog.

49:48.460 --> 49:50.810
I cannot forgive this... trick.

49:50.860 --> 49:52.930
You knew what this would be like for me.

49:52.980 --> 49:55.810
How can I be happy with a man
who is going to burn in Hell?

49:55.860 --> 49:57.490
Your father left you paupers.

49:57.540 --> 49:59.770
It was a kindness to bring you here.

49:59.820 --> 50:01.410
You would have ended up a farmer's wife.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.570
- Who might have loved me.
- And in ten years,

50:03.620 --> 50:06.450
when your hands are red raw with
children squealing to be fed?

50:06.500 --> 50:08.250
At least I would have been a proper woman.

50:08.300 --> 50:10.800
You can be a proper woman
without spawning brats.

50:13.380 --> 50:15.090
What are you doing?

50:15.140 --> 50:17.250
There's nothing for me
here. There never was.

50:17.300 --> 50:19.610
It was a mistake to come.

50:19.660 --> 50:22.650
What will you tell them in
Assendelft, Nella? Words are water.

50:22.700 --> 50:23.970
One drop could drown us all.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.410
I don't expect you to care about me,

50:25.460 --> 50:27.330
but what will happen to Otto and Cornelia?

50:27.380 --> 50:28.890
They are not my responsibility.

50:28.940 --> 50:30.330
But you are mistress of this house.

50:30.380 --> 50:32.210
Whose responsibility
do you think they are?

50:32.260 --> 50:34.850
Well, then perhaps I should
just tell them the truth.

50:34.900 --> 50:37.650
Do you know what they do
to men like my brother?

50:37.700 --> 50:39.170
They drown them.

50:39.220 --> 50:41.650
The holy magistrate will tie
weights around their necks

50:41.700 --> 50:43.170
and push them in the water.

50:43.220 --> 50:44.850
You would be signing his death warrant.

50:44.900 --> 50:46.020
Is that what you want?

51:07.420 --> 51:09.460
Go. Spread your wings!

51:13.500 --> 51:15.020
Madame!

51:22.260 --> 51:25.730
What are they going to do?

51:25.780 --> 51:27.970
Throw me out?

51:28.020 --> 51:30.130
This is your home now, Madame.

51:30.180 --> 51:32.740
How can this house of secrets
ever be called a home?

51:35.740 --> 51:37.780
What is there for you in Assendelft?

51:39.220 --> 51:42.450
From what I hear, there's more
cows than there are people.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.780
What do I have here?

51:46.740 --> 51:49.770
You have a friend, Madame.

51:49.820 --> 51:51.620
And more than just one.

51:53.780 --> 51:56.820
Cornelia, did Marin love someone once?

52:03.500 --> 52:07.460
Why do you think Agnes
Meermans hates Marin so much?

52:08.780 --> 52:11.490
Marin stole her husband's heart.

52:11.540 --> 52:12.580
Frans?

52:15.020 --> 52:18.490
Madame Marin was little more than
a child when she first met him.

52:18.540 --> 52:20.730
He was the Seigneur's friend,

52:20.780 --> 52:23.700
perhaps 18, and Marin was 11 or so.

52:24.820 --> 52:27.930
She first saw him at the
Feast of St Nicholas.

52:27.980 --> 52:31.610
She thought he was a prince, so handsome.

52:31.660 --> 52:33.850
He eats too much now, but back then...

52:33.900 --> 52:37.610
You were barely a child then!
How do you know all of this?

52:37.660 --> 52:39.500
Keyholes, Madame.

52:40.540 --> 52:43.930
When she was 15, the Seigneur
took his first ship out to Batavia.

52:43.980 --> 52:48.690
Frans stayed here -- he was seasick
-- but without a chaperone,

52:48.740 --> 52:50.330
she couldn't meet him.

52:50.380 --> 52:54.050
Then, when Marin was 20, and the
Seigneur had returned a rich man,

52:54.100 --> 52:57.580
Frans came to the house and
asked for her hand in marriage.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.140
And Johannes...

53:02.660 --> 53:04.570
Refused him utterly.

53:04.620 --> 53:09.130
But why? He loved her
enough to wait five years.

53:09.180 --> 53:13.140
Meermans was handsome enough, but
he didn't have a good reputation.

53:14.220 --> 53:16.340
Did Marin find out what Johannes had done?

53:17.580 --> 53:19.410
Eventually.

53:19.460 --> 53:22.530
But by then Frans had married Agnes.

53:22.580 --> 53:25.500
So he's married to Agnes,
but he still loves Marin?

53:28.660 --> 53:33.530
He sends her gifts every St
Nicholas Day, the day they met.

53:33.580 --> 53:36.940
He never puts his name, but
we all know they're from him.

53:40.260 --> 53:42.260
Peebo.

53:43.700 --> 53:46.290
Peebo, where are you?

53:46.340 --> 53:48.010
Peebo.

53:48.060 --> 53:50.620
Peebo where are...

53:56.740 --> 53:59.460
No, no, no, no, no, no.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.900
Peebo!

54:14.380 --> 54:15.980
Peebo!

54:31.340 --> 54:32.610
Hello?

54:32.660 --> 54:33.900
Wait!

54:37.140 --> 54:39.090
Wait!

54:39.140 --> 54:41.420
Open up! St George's Militia.

54:45.060 --> 54:46.570
Nothing, nothing at all.

54:46.620 --> 54:48.380
No, there's nobody here.

54:52.340 --> 54:54.770
I just want to talk to
you. What are you doing?

54:54.820 --> 54:57.370
Madame, you are needed back in the house.

54:57.420 --> 54:59.010
What are you talking about?

54:59.060 --> 55:02.290
We wondered where you had gone,
Madame. Madame Marin was worried.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.930
I was looking for Peebo.

55:04.980 --> 55:06.740
We will help you find him.

55:26.900 --> 55:30.220
"Blue periwinkle for early friends,
Persicaria for restoration.

55:31.980 --> 55:35.060
- "I would buy you a new bird but..."
- It would pale in imitation.

55:36.260 --> 55:41.420
Do you think I can be bought with
a cabinet, or dresses, or flowers?

55:42.740 --> 55:45.820
- I'm not trying to buy you.
- No, because you already succeeded.

55:47.700 --> 55:51.250
Did she know, my mother, when she sold me?

55:51.300 --> 55:55.970
Nella, please. The fault is
mine. Don't blame anyone else.

55:56.020 --> 55:59.770
If they find out, they will drown you.

55:59.820 --> 56:01.890
I've spent my entire life on the sea.

56:01.940 --> 56:04.330
- I am not afraid of drowning.
- And what about me?

56:04.380 --> 56:07.660
You were drowning in Assendelft.
Here you are safe, warm and dry.

56:09.620 --> 56:13.490
I wanted love. Not safety.

56:13.540 --> 56:14.860
As did I.

56:16.860 --> 56:20.540
Always. You see?

56:22.220 --> 56:24.300
The truth is...

56:25.940 --> 56:28.330
.. you and I,

56:29.380 --> 56:32.260
we are more alike than we are different.

56:35.140 --> 56:39.090
Marin, Cornelia, Otto, they wish
for love, but value safety more.

56:39.140 --> 56:43.580
You and I, our hearts are
constructed differently.

56:49.020 --> 56:53.540
What made you like this, do you think?

56:55.460 --> 56:56.740
Nothing made me.

56:59.700 --> 57:02.100
It was in my soul from the beginning.

57:04.900 --> 57:08.940
They could cut me open from head
to foot and still not get it out.

57:18.140 --> 57:19.650
Here...

57:19.700 --> 57:22.540
Please, they're yours. A
peace offering, nothing more.

57:28.020 --> 57:30.770
If you wish to leave, I will not stop you.

57:30.820 --> 57:33.690
Otto will accompany you
back to Assendelft,

57:33.740 --> 57:36.330
with enough to settle your family's debts.

57:36.380 --> 57:37.650
The marriage can be annulled.

57:37.700 --> 57:39.460
You would be free to marry another.

57:41.700 --> 57:43.340
What about the others?

57:44.980 --> 57:46.500
They are not your concern.

57:50.220 --> 57:51.420
And what about you?

57:58.700 --> 58:00.100
I would like you to stay.

58:10.620 --> 58:16.060
If I do, it will not be
because you gave me flowers.

58:19.340 --> 58:21.220
But because this is my home.

58:24.140 --> 58:28.820
And because you swear to tell me the
truth about everything from now on.

58:30.460 --> 58:32.580
Everything, Johannes.

58:40.780 --> 58:43.690
No more secrets.

58:43.740 --> 58:46.700
You have my word.

58:49.100 --> 58:51.290
Was it Jack who delivered this?

58:51.340 --> 58:53.700
It was there when I went
to wash the front steps.

58:55.380 --> 58:56.890
What's in it?

58:56.940 --> 58:58.540
Just some things for my cabinet.

59:01.980 --> 59:03.900
You may go, Cornelia.

59:25.260 --> 59:27.260
"Things can change."

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:18.140
Cornelia! You're sure you didn't
see who delivered that package?

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.580
No, Madame. I told you.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.770
It's November now!

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.700
By December it'll be too late.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.970
Not to mention the damp in the
warehouse spoiling the sugar.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.650
What about the damp in my bones,
boat-hopping in that weather?

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.890
But you were the one who
told them to sell it.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.240
- Get someone else.
- If you are even thinking...

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:46.610
Nella. Did you... Did you have
any luck with your parakeet?

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.740
Where are you going?

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:55.570
Venice. To sell Agnes' sugar.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.250
We thought it'd be best.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.260
- For whom?
- For all of us.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.740
Do you have the sample loaves?

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.610
My word is enough.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.490
Why don't you take her?

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:23.820
She'd only get in the way.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.140
Look after her while I'm gone.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.060
Goodbye.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.620
You put the flowers in your hair.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.140
For restoration.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.410
Didn't you want to see Venice?

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.180
I've been, Madame. Once is
enough to see the Doge's palace.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.980
He could have taken me.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.540
What are you trying to do to us?

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.500
Who have you told about us?

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.410
Nobody. No, you don't understand...

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.050
Dogs and furniture, I understand.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.490
But Jack Philips?

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:47.420
What are you doing? Marin, no.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.770
You shouldn't have done that.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.730
Don't play with fire, Petronella.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.100
Or you'll get burned along
with the rest of us.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.210
What are you doing here?

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.930
Get out. Get out!

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.300
Wait. Wait.

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.500
I'm back on deliveries.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.860
I have something for you, Madame.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.250
You have no right to be
here. Johannes said...

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.770
You squeal like a mouse.
I need to see him.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.650
Is he back yet? Johannes!

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.770
He's not here.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:55.490
You need to leave.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.890
So, it's true. He's gone to Venice.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.690
Well, don't tell me you believed him

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.330
- when he said he was going
there to work. - How dare you!

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:07.410
I know him, Madame, better than you.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.730
No-one works in Venice.

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.050
Milan, maybe.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:16.410
But Venice is all dark
canals and courtesans

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.010
and pretty little boys like moths,
flying to the brightest flame.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.180
What's happening? Why
is the front door open?

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.700
Get out.

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.140
Get out!

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.940
How many times have I
told you to keep away?

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.090
Clean that up.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.570
Your brother would fuck a
dog if the price was right.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.650
I said clean it up.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.730
They say he gives it to you, too
-- that he's the only man that will.

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.050
What a tired old insult.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.690
How brave are you really, Jack?

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.580
Do you dare draw my blood?

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.930
Is that what you really want?

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.410
Bitch. He said I couldn't
work for him any more.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.210
And whose idea was that?

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.770
Oh, so that's what this is about?

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.890
You child!

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.650
Just tell me what it'll
cost to get you to go away.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.010
I don't want your money.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.410
I'm here to show you what
happens when you meddle.

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.660
Otto, he has a knife.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.490
Go.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.060
Before I kill you.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:30.090
He dresses you up as a lord,
but the truth is you're nothing

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.850
but a savage.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.890
Do you know what he says about you?

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:37.250
He's going to get rid of you, savage.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.050
Sell you to the highest bidder.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.290
You're nothing to him, boy.

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.930
Now go.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.340
Agh!

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.979
God speed.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.260
What if Jack reports what I did?

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.490
You heard what he said
-- attempted murder,

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.529
with a knife and a wound to prove it.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.979
The Militia would arrest me.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.210
When they ask Jack why he was here?

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.380
He'd be signing his own death
warrant if he told them.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.500
English, a sodomite...

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.729
.. a former actor in the playhouses?

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:16.170
I can't think of three things
the Burgomasters hate more.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.050
He has no money, and he needs it.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.220
A man may do anything
when he is desperate.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.649
The Seigneur saved me,
he taught me everything.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.130
And look how I've repaid him.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.939
There was never any debt to pay.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:40.810
Johannes bought you for his own amusement.

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:42.220
He employed me, Madame.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:47.859
You haven't killed
anyone. The boy's alive.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.770
Johannes will be more worried
about his dog than you.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:54.180
I've endangered you.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.420
I've endangered all of you.

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.540
Are you reading my mind now?

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.410
"Every woman is the architect
of her own fortune."

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.210
"I fight to emerge."

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.890
"Things can change."

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:04.020
"The turnip cannot thrive in
the tulip's patch of soil."

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.410
Enough of this. Who are you?

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.690
What do you want from me?

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.930
Are you a spy?

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.080
What is your business with Agnes Meermans?

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.890
I know you're in there.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.370
You have to come out eventually.

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.930
I can wait.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.330
There's no need to bellow.
They can hear you in Antwerp.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.970
I need to find the miniaturist.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.340
The what? No-one's been in
that building for over a week.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.860
But only yesterday she...

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.220
What's your name? I might
have something for you.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.540
Petronella Brandt.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.580
Left on that doorstep.

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.020
Cornelia.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.100
"Don't let sweet weapons stray."

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.850
Madame! The Seigneur has returned.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.780
He's already asking where Rzecki is.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.650
You haven't told him?

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:39.850
Rzecki!

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.170
I couldn't do it. It
has to be you. Please.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.540
Rzecki!

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.610
Johannes.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.820
You're home safe.

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.300
Was Venice enjoyable?

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.850
Venice was Venice.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:03.060
The Venetians never shut up, and
too much dancing for my knees.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.300
It's good to see you.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.050
Rzecki!

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.000
Why is there no fire in this room?
The house is freezing. Otto!

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.580
Morning, Otto.

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.530
Something wrong?

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.010
How many loaves did you
sell in Venice, brother?

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.050
It was slow.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.850
I told you I should have
waited until the New Year.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:40.050
Then perhaps it would be better
to build such a gigantic fire

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.810
once the sugar is actually sold.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.530
Don't provoke me, Marin.

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.810
It was you who forced me

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:47.050
to go out on a ship to Italy
in the dead of winter.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.810
You are the provocateur, not me.

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.090
And stop talking about this
household as if it's yours.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.660
It belongs to Petronella now.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.820
Then she can have it.

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:07.850
I have wasted enough of my life

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.020
keeping yours smooth.

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:16.260
We are all nothing but prisoners
to your desire, all of us.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.660
Otto, do you feel like a prisoner?

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:26.050
- No, Seigneur.
- What do you expect him to say?!

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.850
Look around you, Marin! Amsterdam
is closing down like a vice.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.210
This house is the only
place any of us are free.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.850
You. You are free.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.570
You think because you have some
maps on your wall, some books

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:40.210
and a few animal skulls you know
my business better than I do?

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.250
Stop! Stop!

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.130
All you had to do was
marry. The one thing.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.970
- Marry rich, marry well. - Both of
you! - But no, you couldn't do that.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.010
God knows we tried,

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.660
- but all the guilders in Amsterdam...
- Rzecki is dead!

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.260
What?

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.900
Rzecki. She's dead, Johannes.

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.610
Is this true?

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:08.980
Oh, yes. And all your own fault.

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.940
Your Englishman came knocking
yesterday. Your brothel moth.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:21.930
He put a dagger through her head
right here in your own hallway.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:27.330
I warned you about him. Over and over.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:28.860
If it hadn't been for Otto...

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.140
- What did you do to him?
- I didn't mean to.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.010
What did you do?

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.250
He showed mercy.

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.300
Your pretty little English
whelp got up and walked away.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.210
"Dear Seigneur Windelbreke,
I am writing to

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.650
"enquire about an apprentice you once had.

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.770
"She is female, with a tall,
fair-haired appearance,

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.220
"and stares at me as if she
would look into my soul.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.570
"She has crept into my life, Seigneur,

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.610
"and the miniatures she sends
are becoming more unnerving.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.760
"How did she come to you
and why did she leave?"

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.890
Did you find him?

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.530
Who?

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.890
Please, Johannes. You swore.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.610
No more lies, remember?

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.500
You went to find Jack, didn't you?

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.690
It's hard to tell the truth

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.890
when your whole life has been
built on lies and silence.

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:45.040
Nobody has ever been much
interested in hearing it, until now.

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.930
This is not the marriage you
imagined for yourself, is it?

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.970
I was foolish to imagine anything.

01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:01.290
Without imagination, what else
is there? And you are no fool.

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.020
How much of the sugar did you
manage to sell in Venice?

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.050
What is happening, Johannes?

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.330
Why will you not sell their sugar?

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:14.130
Look at me. The truth.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.620
The truth?

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.370
Because Frans hates me and
would like to destroy me.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.610
And Agnes hates Marin.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.970
While they had no
inheritance, they had no power.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:24.810
But once they have the
money from the sugar,

01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.090
there will be nothing in
Amsterdam that will stop them.

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.930
Then why agree to sell
it in the first place?

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.980
Because if I didn't, somebody else would.

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.210
You can't hold them at bay for ever.

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.620
I know.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.380
The truth.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.380
Now you have it.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.340
You said something
earlier that wasn't true.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.740
What was that?

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.780
That our marriage was a lie.

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.740
Isn't it?

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.500
Not a lie.

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.900
Just different.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.370
Tell me, Johannes.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.610
How does this end?

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.500
I'll tell you how it ends.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.410
Come January, I'll be gone again.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:48.780
And this time I'll make their profit
for them and all will be well.

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:54.100
My stock always sells when
I want it to. I promise.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.420
What about you?

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.500
I'll take the consequences.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.060
There has to be another way.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.820
Here...

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.170
.. I've something to show you.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.900
Rzecki.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540
I've never seen anything like it.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.850
Who on earth could have made such a thing?

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.380
I've been asking myself
that question for weeks.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.770
Wake up, Madame, please!

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.450
What is it? Cornelia, what's wrong?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.850
Is it Johannes?

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.810
No, Madame. It's Otto.

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.140
He's gone.

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.050
Why did he have to run like that?

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.970
I'll check the docks first.

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.340
And then the prisons,
in case he was arrested.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.700
Cornelia!

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.530
Cornelia!

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.580
I can't light the kindling.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.450
I told him nothing would happen.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.810
Why didn't he listen to me?

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:34.250
It's better that he's gone. By
leaving here, he protected us.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.450
Imagine what would
happen to a man like Otto

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.210
if the Burgomasters got hold of him.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:43.370
You knew he was going
to leave, didn't you?

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.220
Let's just say he saw sense.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.820
You sent him away, Madame?

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.930
I suggested it.

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:58.620
Yes, and we all know how
your suggestions work.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.740
What if it's the Militia, come for Otto?

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:09.940
Well, they won't find him, will they?

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.810
- Frans.
- Where is Johannes? Johannes!

01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:29.170
He'll be at the bourse.

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.450
No, I've been to the bourse, and
the Company, and several taverns.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.890
I am not my brother's keeper.

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.420
More's the pity for all of us.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.330
Last night I went to the warehouse
to see for myself how much

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:40.420
sugar had been sold.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.050
Not a grain has been shifted.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.180
Not a single blasted
grain of all that sugar.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.380
But it's worse than that.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.410
Our fortune, our entire fortune,

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.450
is mouldering in the dark.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.530
I touched it. Some of it was paste.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.090
No, Frans. That's impossible.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.050
Johannes would never
permit that to happen.

01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.250
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.210
God knows, that would be reason
enough to ruin Johannes Brandt.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:15.380
But there was worse to come. Far worse.

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.450
Do you know what we saw,

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.140
pressed up against the walls?

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:30.050
- We saw his devilry.
- What are you talking about?

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.690
Oh, come on, Marin.
You've always known it.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.010
You must have. But you... Did you know it?

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:39.020
How he spends his time up
against the warehouse walls?

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:44.490
Such a thing cannot be
unseen. That's right.

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:48.690
Now you know, and soon the
world will have to know,

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.540
how your husband takes his
vile pleasures -- with a boy.

01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:57.420
And what's more...

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:03.050
What's more, the boy says he attacked him.

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:08.930
No, you've made a mistake,
that's not possible.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.220
Frans.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:16.380
Frans, please... you're his friend.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.180
Do not seek his punishment.

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.730
You know how it will end.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.610
That friendship died years ago.

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.340
Our sugar is as abandoned as his soul.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.810
Johannes Brandt is a worm
in the fruit of the city.

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.770
And I must do my duty as a citizen.

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:37.130
Frans, you will ruin us.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.490
Turn away from this.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.650
Surely, we can... We can
come to some arrangement.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:47.340
- We will sell your sugar and
let that be an end. - No.

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:50.780
I'm a different man now.

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.940
I don't believe...

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.540
It can't be true!

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:14.130
Surely, he can't have been such a fool!

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.410
Madame, calm, please

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.810
Did you not hear him?

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.050
He is going straight to the Burgomasters.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.570
Then his arrogance is a gift.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.490
Johannes still has a few hours to escape.

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.250
First Otto, now the Seigneur?

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:28.450
But we can't live here,
just the three of us.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.890
I don't know how, but we need
to find a way to sell the sugar

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.370
and buy his silence.
It can't all be rotten.

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.580
Nothing will keep his silence.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.850
And what do you know of selling sugar?

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.410
I am searching for the light, Marin.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.060
There must be some in all this darkness.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.140
You have to go. You have to leave now.

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.980
Nella, what's wrong, what's happening?

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:19.620
Frans and Agnes saw you.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.020
They saw you, Johannes.

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.400
At the warehouse, with a young man.

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.540
Was it Jack?

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:35.650
How could you, after
the way he betrayed you?

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.090
It is not Jack Philips who
has betrayed me, Nella.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.180
It is this city.

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:45.010
Neighbours watching neighbours,
twisting ropes to bind us all.

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:48.540
Well, they cannot bind
you if you are not here.

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.090
Where will you go?

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.290
I have friends in many countries.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:01.810
What does it open?

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.570
The warehouse. Here is the
list that I've been working on.

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.970
People who may be interested in the sugar.

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.050
Give it to Marin.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.490
She's always wanted to run
my business and now she can.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.100
But she'll find it's not
as simple as she thinks.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.890
Will you ever come back?

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.090
Amsterdam is a city like no other,
but I have never called it home.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.850
- Well, where is home?
- Wherever comfort is.

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.140
But for a man like me,
it can be hard to find.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.410
I'll miss you.

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:33.620
I'll miss you, too. More
than I ever expected.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.700
Where is Marin? Marin!

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:43.020
She says she is too ill to come down.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.300
Johannes!

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.420
Take me with you.

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.380
You're serious?

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:59.900
A man travelling with his wife
doesn't attract a second glance.

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.330
They need you here, Nella.

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.130
Otto, Cornelia.

01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:13.220
Even Marin, much more than you know. Here.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.940
Promise me you'll come back.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.660
No lies, remember?

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.860
I cannot change what I am...

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.460
One day, perhaps.

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.770
What happened?

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.130
The Militia came for her last night.

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.580
- You said she'd gone.
- Then why are you here?

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.050
- I thought she might have returned.
- So did they.

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:01.940
They left disappointed, but
they cleared the place out.

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.090
Marin, would you happen to have...

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.860
- I'm coming in.
- No, no, no please don't.

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.620
What, by all the angels...?

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.020
Go away.

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.930
What is that in your hand?

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.580
- I said go away.
- What is it? Marin!

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.090
No! No!

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.810
You have no right.

01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.010
You understand nothing!

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.370
I understand everything.
Johannes will be safe.

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.210
And even if they catch him,
I have a list of names.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.740
We will sell the sugar
and it will all be fine.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.530
Oh, you stupid, stupid girl.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.660
Don't you see?

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.170
It's not about him.

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.700
What don't I see?

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.170
Now do you see?

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.900
My God, Marin.

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.180
What have you done?
