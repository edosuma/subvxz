-Oh, they seem to be doing okay.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.091
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm about to go on IG Live.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.054
Like I said, "IG Live."

00:55.281 --> 00:57.114
All right, Meg's going
for her phone. She...

00:57.132 --> 00:59.116
Uhp, no,
she's just scratching herself.

00:59.134 --> 01:01.042
Well, uh, anyway,
if-if you guys are gonna join,

01:01.062 --> 01:04.063
just go into another room,
or I'll get interference.

01:04.214 --> 01:06.473
Other than that, uh...

01:06.625 --> 01:09.142
I don't know, just buckle up
and enjoy the ride.

01:09.295 --> 01:11.236
Oh, and I tagged
Kurt Vonnegut's nephew,

01:11.405 --> 01:14.481
so just...
just be cool on there.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.659
Boy, he's sure living
a lot longer than we expected.

01:20.730 --> 01:24.065
Going live in three, two, one.

01:24.234 --> 01:27.569
(howls) What's up, IG Live?!

01:27.588 --> 01:32.316
It's Brian Griffin, and
you are live in the "Dog House."

01:32.334 --> 01:35.152
Okay, no viewers yet.
I'll do it again.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.678
Hopefully I can keep
that energy.

01:37.747 --> 01:38.931
Uhp, got my first viewer.

01:39.082 --> 01:41.266
Whoa! Getting a little crowded
in here.

01:41.493 --> 01:45.996
And @BuyCryptoKid33 has
left the building.

01:46.089 --> 01:49.274
All right,
welcome @WinACarAskMeHow.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.778
And we got @LearnGuitarIn7Days
on the line.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.113
Let's get started.

01:54.264 --> 01:55.948
What I'm sure is
on both your minds is:

01:56.099 --> 01:58.675
what is the "hero's journey"?

01:58.768 --> 02:01.603
Well, that's a question pondered
by writers for many, many--

02:01.622 --> 02:06.032
welcome, @Gain4InchesIn1Week--
many years.

02:06.201 --> 02:08.127
Let me recap
what we've learned so far.

02:08.354 --> 02:11.505
Writer, "hero's journey,"
many, many, many years.

02:13.450 --> 02:16.784
On the page that seemed
like eight minutes of material.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.695
Should we bail him out
with a question?

02:18.788 --> 02:20.697
No, we're not gonna
bail him out with a question.

02:20.716 --> 02:22.141
We're gonna... You know what?

02:22.368 --> 02:24.726
I will ask him a question.
Give me your phone.

02:25.795 --> 02:26.728
(notification pops)

02:29.150 --> 02:31.692
(gasps) We're gonna take
a quick break.

02:35.397 --> 02:36.989
Hey, guys,
I brought in your paper.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.140
Why do you get the newspaper
if you're not gonna read it?

02:39.160 --> 02:41.718
Eh, sometimes I use it
to punctuate my sentences.

02:41.737 --> 02:43.904
Well, anyway, I have a proposal
for the two of you.

02:44.056 --> 02:46.522
Well, this
ought to be interesting.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.169
Are the two of you free tonight
for a double date?

02:50.320 --> 02:52.820
I'm seeing this girl, and
I think she's something special.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.006
I want you to meet her.

02:54.157 --> 02:55.990
Oh, Glenn, that's wonderful.

02:56.084 --> 02:58.177
A-And you're sure she's not
a sex worker this time?

02:58.253 --> 02:59.678
No, I-I'm pretty sure.

02:59.829 --> 03:02.163
I've offered her money many
times, and she hasn't taken it.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.184
A double date sounds great.
We'd love to go.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.744
(singsongy): Ooh,
the Quag's got a girlfriend.

03:07.763 --> 03:10.247
Ah! Get off me! We don't have
that kind of relationship.

03:10.265 --> 03:12.082
Shoo! Go on, Meg!
Get away from the houseguest!

03:12.175 --> 03:13.675
Get away from the houseguest!

03:13.769 --> 03:15.343
Sometimes I also use it
for that.

03:15.437 --> 03:17.679
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Newspapers: Because your parrot</i>

03:17.698 --> 03:19.698
<i> can't (bleep) on an iPad.</i>

03:24.263 --> 03:25.687
-(notification chimes)
-Whoa.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.281
A DM from @OfficialInstagram?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.708
"Hello, Brian.

03:29.935 --> 03:32.102
"As a famous writer,
you are now eligible

03:32.195 --> 03:34.438
to become a verified account."

03:34.531 --> 03:36.106
Yes! Finally!

03:36.199 --> 03:39.051
Well, maybe next you can get
a verified paycheck.

03:40.295 --> 03:42.888
Why is your paper
called<i> Brazilian Teens?</i>

03:43.115 --> 03:45.474
Well, what's your paper of
record for tan butts?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.269
Exactly.

03:53.216 --> 03:55.959
I can't wait to meet this
new girlfriend of Quagmire's.

03:55.978 --> 03:57.736
You know, I always write
their names down

03:57.887 --> 04:00.030
in case his life
becomes a<i> Dateline.</i>

04:04.060 --> 04:07.137
(gasps) Oh, my God! It's her!

04:07.230 --> 04:10.064
-What? It's who?
-Quagmire's girlfriend is

04:10.084 --> 04:12.584
my old junior high school bully,
Stephanie.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.569
She made my life a living hell.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.496
Oh, see,
that guy's wearing sandals.

04:16.648 --> 04:17.814
I could've worn mine.

04:17.907 --> 04:19.091
Peter, you don't know this

04:19.242 --> 04:20.500
because you met me
in high school,

04:20.594 --> 04:23.987
but middle school was a
painfully awkward phase for me.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.265
(lively chatter)

04:28.827 --> 04:31.419
<i> I had horrible acne,</i>
<i> I had to wear a back brace,</i>

04:31.513 --> 04:34.831
<i> and to make things worse, only</i>
<i> one of my boobs had come in.</i>

04:34.850 --> 04:37.501
<i> I had to resort to filling</i>
<i> the empty side of my bra</i>

04:37.594 --> 04:39.836
<i> with a Pop-O-Matic</i>
<i> from the board game Trouble.</i>

04:39.855 --> 04:41.095
(popping)

04:42.024 --> 04:45.284
<i> The other kids were cruel and</i>
<i> would call me horrible names.</i>

04:45.435 --> 04:47.119
(laughter)

04:47.346 --> 04:49.195
-Look, it's Scoli-Lois.
-What a freak.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.182
I just ate a sandwich, so
I'm waiting 20 minutes to swim.

04:52.275 --> 04:54.868
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i>But the worst bully of them all</i>
<i> was Stephanie.</i>

04:54.962 --> 04:56.944
Hey, Lois, watch your step.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.538
Your shoe's untied.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.357
(screams)

05:00.375 --> 05:02.283
(laughter)

05:02.303 --> 05:03.877
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i> No one even tried to help.</i>

05:04.029 --> 05:05.879
-What a loser!
-Walk much?

05:06.031 --> 05:07.306
18 more minutes.

05:07.457 --> 05:09.141
<i> I would've drowned</i>
<i> if it wasn't for the buoyancy</i>

05:09.292 --> 05:10.792
<i> of the Pop-O-Matic.</i>

05:10.811 --> 05:13.061
-(pops)
-(gasping)

05:14.631 --> 05:18.299
Stephanie never even apologized,
and junior high trauma

05:18.319 --> 05:20.377
is something
you don't recover from.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.712
Yeah, my gym teacher drove me
home without his pants on,

05:22.731 --> 05:24.990
but your story sounds bad, too.

05:28.570 --> 05:31.163
Well, looks like all that
hard work is finally paying off.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.073
I got verified on Instagram.

05:33.225 --> 05:35.375
Look at that, a blue check.

05:37.729 --> 05:39.821
Blue check? That's green.

05:39.915 --> 05:41.006
Brian, you got hacked.

05:41.157 --> 05:42.082
That's ridiculous.

05:42.234 --> 05:43.249
Someone DM'd me and said

05:43.402 --> 05:45.159
they just needed
my mother's maiden name,

05:45.179 --> 05:47.070
the last four numbers
of my credit card,

05:47.072 --> 05:49.163
and the first 12 numbers
of my credit card.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.016
Then they responded
right away with,

05:51.167 --> 05:52.742
"Thank you, comploted."

05:52.761 --> 05:54.001
Huh.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.245
That's not how you spell
"completed."

05:55.414 --> 05:57.581
-(phone rings)
-It's my credit card company.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.082
Hello?

05:59.175 --> 06:00.600
No, that wasn't me.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.010
No. No. Ma'am,
I wouldn't know what to do

06:03.030 --> 06:05.012
with that many
Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.347
-Yuck.
-(phone beeps)

06:06.367 --> 06:08.349
Okay, you were right.
I got hacked.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.111
I'm so mad,
that hacker has me seeing gray.

06:11.263 --> 06:13.163
Red. It's red, Brian.

06:18.528 --> 06:20.120
Why are you so upset?

06:20.272 --> 06:21.880
You already canceled
your credit card.

06:22.107 --> 06:24.107
This hacker is
destroying my Instagram.

06:24.126 --> 06:25.291
I have a brand.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.293
Posting Steve Harvey
stand-up jokes

06:27.388 --> 06:29.462
is actually
Steve Harvey's brand.

06:29.615 --> 06:31.706
I think you should just
give your account to the hacker.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.208
I mean, your Instagram wasn't
setting the world on fire.

06:34.377 --> 06:36.469
And I suppose
the hacker's posts are better?

06:36.622 --> 06:38.304
Look at this, it's just
a half a bottle of vodka

06:38.399 --> 06:40.715
that says,
<i> "Eto vodka-chas gde-to."</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:42.175
Brian, what does that even mean?

06:42.327 --> 06:44.236
Hit "See translation."

06:44.387 --> 06:46.238
"It's vodka o'clock somewhere."

06:46.389 --> 06:48.798
(laughing):
Oh, that's very funny.
That's very funny.

06:48.817 --> 06:50.800
You know, I've heard
it's "wine o'clock,"

06:50.819 --> 06:52.469
but I've never heard it
with vodka.

06:52.487 --> 06:55.138
That's what... That's-that's
whip smart is what that is.

06:55.231 --> 06:56.656
No! No, it's not!

06:56.808 --> 06:58.141
Stewie, I need to get
my account back.

06:58.234 --> 07:01.161
I-I may have sent
some weird DMs to Zendaya

07:01.313 --> 07:03.070
that I'd rather
not see the light of day.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.649
<i> Euphoria</i> Zendaya
or Disney Zendaya?

07:05.667 --> 07:08.910
Yeah, a little from column A,
a little from column B.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.720
We need to get
that account back.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.160
Lois Pewterschmidt,
what a small world.

07:17.179 --> 07:18.845
Nice to see you, too.

07:18.997 --> 07:21.681
You have aged
infuriatingly well.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.016
So, how did you two meet?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.092
Did you both escape
from the same sex cult?

07:25.187 --> 07:26.427
Sex cults sound terrible,

07:26.505 --> 07:28.280
but also,
how do I get invited to one?

07:28.431 --> 07:29.781
-You tell it.
-No, you tell it.

07:29.933 --> 07:30.857
No, you just tell it.

07:31.026 --> 07:32.934
-No, you. Fine, I'll go.
-No, you, you go.

07:33.102 --> 07:34.101
(both laughing)

07:34.196 --> 07:35.528
Okay, Tinder.

07:35.681 --> 07:37.772
Huh, didn't really need
that whole parade.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.199
And how did you two meet?

07:39.367 --> 07:42.352
Lois was dating another guy,
and I threatened to kill myself.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.612
Lois, remember you had
that back brace

07:44.631 --> 07:47.040
everyone said made you look like
an ironing board in a sweater?

07:47.116 --> 07:49.526
(giggles) Say more stuff.

07:49.544 --> 07:51.970
You were a nerd? I thought
you said you were a prom queen.

07:52.121 --> 07:53.972
<i> Prawn</i> Queen.

07:54.049 --> 07:55.215
She ate a lot of shellfish,

07:55.309 --> 07:56.533
and her back was curved
liked a shrimp.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.977
(giggles) I've never
meant this before,

07:59.204 --> 08:00.962
but we should do this again.

08:01.056 --> 08:02.797
Kids were so mean back then.

08:02.891 --> 08:05.225
Well, I barely remember
those years.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.635
Peter and I have
three lovely kids.

08:07.729 --> 08:10.897
They're a lot happier since
you're allowed to be fat now.

08:11.049 --> 08:14.141
Being a mom is the most
fulfilling job in the world.

08:14.236 --> 08:16.161
Oh, do you have kids?

08:16.312 --> 08:17.570
Be careful how you answer this.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.406
Oh, I wish I did,
but after medical school,

08:20.501 --> 08:23.484
then a four-year residency,
a two-year specialty,

08:23.504 --> 08:26.229
three years in Central America
with Doctors Without Borders...

08:26.248 --> 08:28.581
Okay. Well, I'm sure
all those achievements

08:28.675 --> 08:30.750
will come visit you
when you're on your death bed.

08:30.902 --> 08:33.737
Excuse me, some of
the other diners have complained

08:33.830 --> 08:35.514
that you're not talking
loudly enough.

08:35.665 --> 08:38.241
They're loving these stories
about how she was a nerd.

08:38.334 --> 08:41.244
It was "prawn queen"!
Like the shrimp!

08:41.263 --> 08:43.480
MAN:
Oh, that's even funnier!

08:46.084 --> 08:47.600
(chuckles) You know what?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.343
I feel sorry for Stephanie now.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.255
Really? What part?
The good skin or the great job?

08:52.274 --> 08:53.940
Oh, pfft. "Great job."

08:54.034 --> 08:55.867
Anyone can be a doctor
in Ecuador.

08:56.094 --> 08:57.277
You think
they're checking diplomas?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.945
And she doesn't have any kids.

08:59.097 --> 09:01.264
Probably can't.
You know why? GMOs.

09:01.357 --> 09:03.266
Just gonna run this light
real quick.

09:03.359 --> 09:05.285
-(engine revs)
-(horn honks)

09:05.437 --> 09:06.452
Settle down.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.380
I mean, I ate way better
than she was eating.

09:08.531 --> 09:10.215
Did you see
I ordered a salad?

09:10.366 --> 09:13.109
It was a wedge that was mostly
bleu cheese and bacon.

09:13.128 --> 09:15.202
It was listed under "salad."

09:15.371 --> 09:17.797
But did you notice Stephanie
ordered french fries?

09:17.949 --> 09:20.967
French fries, no kids,
you do the math.

09:21.119 --> 09:24.104
Anyway, point is,
I won dinner.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.381
-(horn honks)
-Settle down.

09:28.310 --> 09:31.127
I mean, you-you think
I won dinner, right, Peter?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.313
Well, you did eat
a lot faster than her.

09:33.389 --> 09:35.556
And-and now that
I think about it,

09:35.576 --> 09:38.559
after she said I looked "good,"
she looked right at my hands.

09:38.728 --> 09:41.638
What does that mean? Age comes
out in the hands, Peter.

09:41.656 --> 09:43.323
Maybe she's trying to figure out
how old I am!

09:43.417 --> 09:45.232
Well, but she knows
how old I am.

09:45.327 --> 09:48.110
(gasps) I bet she was judging
my tiny wedding ring.

09:48.146 --> 09:49.921
Why was she looking
at my hands, Peter?!

09:50.073 --> 09:51.756
I think your thumb was
in the butter.

09:51.908 --> 09:53.258
But did she see that?

09:53.485 --> 09:54.834
I don't know, but
nobody ate butter after that,

09:54.986 --> 09:56.519
so yeah, probably.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.672
I love that she had to ask
what "caprese" was.

09:59.825 --> 10:01.341
What a dumb bitch.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.343
What-What's going on
with your face?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.920
(laughs): I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:06.014 --> 10:08.589
Maybe-maybe it's
a giant grin, huh?

10:08.683 --> 10:11.501
From having triumphed
over my former bully!

10:12.504 --> 10:14.779
There's a rash forming
on the back of your legs.

10:15.006 --> 10:16.114
What? There is?

10:16.265 --> 10:18.265
-(back cracks)
-Ah! Son of a bitch!

10:18.285 --> 10:20.101
Lois, what the hell's
going on with you?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.845
I don't know!

10:21.938 --> 10:23.363
I think seeing Stephanie
brought back

10:23.515 --> 10:25.849
one of my old junior high school
panic attacks.

10:25.942 --> 10:28.351
(gasping) Quick,
I have to do the only thing

10:28.370 --> 10:29.794
that would calm me back then:

10:29.946 --> 10:32.856
lie in a dark room
and try to blast Sarah McLachlan

10:32.874 --> 10:35.050

-So, Instagram update...
-We're talking!

11:01.853 --> 11:03.144
The hacker contacted me.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.071
He's demanding $10,000!

11:05.148 --> 11:06.981
I hear you're looking
to kill somebody.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.908
What? No.
I'm just trying to find a guy

11:09.060 --> 11:10.226
who hacked my Instagram account.

11:10.245 --> 11:11.485
I can also help with that.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.838
I'm really good at
finding cyberbullies.

11:14.065 --> 11:16.174
One time, I got
an anonymous tweet telling me

11:16.401 --> 11:19.752
to go kill myself and I tracked
the IP address to...

11:19.829 --> 11:20.845
-Chrissy Teigen.
-Chrissy Teigen?

11:20.997 --> 11:22.755
Yeah, that's...
It's kind of her thing.

11:23.758 --> 11:25.350
-I don't know
how you're gonna find...
-That's in Russia.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.519
(speaking Russian)

11:31.933 --> 11:33.340
How do you know
how to speak Russian?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.935
If you watch enough super dark
videos on the Internet,

11:36.087 --> 11:37.511
eventually
you're gonna learn Russian.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.181
First, just the Russian words
for "please don't kill me,"

11:40.200 --> 11:42.592
but it's amazing how those
are really the building blocks

11:42.685 --> 11:44.035
of an entire language.

11:44.112 --> 11:46.262
-German's very similar.
-And then I was able to make

11:46.355 --> 11:48.281
some friends
in a Russian AOL chatroom.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.524
You've got a whole
little life going on, huh?

11:50.618 --> 11:52.952
Can you figure out what city
this hacker lives in?

11:53.029 --> 11:54.787
Okay, I'm thinking
the big boys in Moscow

11:54.940 --> 11:56.289
are phishing in Europe.

11:56.441 --> 11:58.199
Russia has 11 time zones,
so if we triangulate

11:58.293 --> 12:00.626
the activity
through peak hours...

12:00.779 --> 12:01.945
Yup. Just what I thought.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.055
-Chelyabinsk.
-That was fast.

12:05.283 --> 12:07.208
You got to move fast
in this world, bro.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.452
So, are we gonna go
find this guy or what?

12:09.454 --> 12:11.429
All right, looks like
we're going to Russia.

12:11.656 --> 12:14.399
Russia? We can't go there.
They're at war with Ukraine!

12:14.626 --> 12:17.384
-They are? Whoa, crazy.
-I say we do it.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.404
We're really gonna go
to a country at war,

12:19.631 --> 12:22.240
and we couldn't go to my
business meeting on Fire Island?

12:22.467 --> 12:26.970
-What business meeting?
-I sell bikini swimsuits
for "men of size."

12:26.988 --> 12:28.913
-You mean fat guys?
-No.

12:29.065 --> 12:31.124
(laughs):
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:42.003 --> 12:44.003
Are you here
for business or displeasure?

12:44.172 --> 12:45.746
We're here to find
the hacker that...

12:45.824 --> 12:47.265
Stole your Instagram, yes.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.826

-Hey!

12:55.850 --> 12:57.609
It's that way.

13:00.505 --> 13:03.356
And then Nurse Maguire
gave everyone a valentine

13:03.508 --> 13:04.674

13:04.767 --> 13:06.934

-Dr. Hartman,

13:12.867 --> 13:14.292
I have no idea what's going on.

13:14.519 --> 13:17.111
I feel like I'm turning back
into my old teenage self,

13:17.130 --> 13:19.280
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.058
I see. Did you recently
run into an old bully

13:22.193 --> 13:24.027
or were you tagged
in a very unflattering

13:24.045 --> 13:25.528
Throwback Thursday photo?

13:25.547 --> 13:29.215
I did. I ran into a girl who
terrorized me in junior high

13:29.367 --> 13:31.884
and she used to call me
Scoli-Lois.

13:32.053 --> 13:34.295
(laughs) Like "scoliosis."
That's very good.

13:34.372 --> 13:36.372
I just learned what that is
today, as a matter of fact.

13:36.391 --> 13:39.633
Dr. Hartman,
what's happening to me?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.653
Well, Mrs. Griffin,
I think you're suffering

13:41.880 --> 13:43.546
from severe nerd damage.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.381
I am? What's that?

13:45.400 --> 13:48.384
You see, all nerds are
one tossed-off joke away

13:48.553 --> 13:51.312
from reverting to their worst,
most humiliating selves.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.665
But I don't want to be
a nerd forever.

13:53.741 --> 13:56.150
Tell you what,
find the coolest guy in school

13:56.169 --> 13:57.818
and give him a tug
behind the bleachers.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.819
That usually solves it.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.338

quite a bit of Kuz right now.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.278
Where's your stuff?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.614
Brian, we came here
to find your account

18:53.633 --> 18:56.783
but found something
much more valuable:

18:56.952 --> 18:58.085
my happiness.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.120
Yeah, le-let me be
the writer, Meg.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.864
I can't go back home.

19:01.883 --> 19:03.975
What?
You're staying in Russia?

19:04.126 --> 19:06.719
This is a country where
female body hair is encouraged,

19:06.813 --> 19:09.555
where I can eat root vegetables
straight from the ground

19:09.707 --> 19:12.892
without being placed under
an involuntary psychiatric hold.

19:12.968 --> 19:15.561
Last night,
when Ivan made love to me...

19:15.713 --> 19:16.545
-Aah, no, no, no.
-Uh, please, please stop.

19:16.639 --> 19:17.638
-Nope, nope, nope.
-Stop, stop.

19:17.732 --> 19:19.548
He said,
(Russian accent): "Meg Griffin,

19:19.567 --> 19:21.993
you have strong haunches
like horse."

19:22.144 --> 19:23.903
(regular accent):
How sweet is that?

19:24.055 --> 19:26.146
I'm an eight in Russia, Brian.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.648
I'm staying here.

19:27.742 --> 19:29.834
Well, okay.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.077
But we're truly gonna miss you.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.398
And if this really is
the end of our time together,

19:35.416 --> 19:37.917
we probably ought to tally up
expenses from the trip.

19:38.069 --> 19:40.419
Oh, um, okay.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.346
Yeah, I bought that magazine
at the airport,

19:42.498 --> 19:44.256
so let's put that
in the "group" column.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.017
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
-Yeah, no,

19:46.093 --> 19:48.168
airport purchases,
we said, were all together.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.169
You're the only one
who read that.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.429
It goes in the "Brian" column.

19:50.581 --> 19:52.356
You read the cover.
You commented on it.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.100
All I said was, "When did
Miles Teller get so jacked?"

19:55.253 --> 19:57.010
-Yeah. That's reading.
-That's not reading.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.088
That's just looking at a picture
and commenting.

19:59.181 --> 20:00.773
So you're saying
the words "Miles Teller"

20:00.925 --> 20:02.015
were not on the cover?

20:02.035 --> 20:03.776
Oh, okay, well,
when I bought my Clif Bar,

20:03.870 --> 20:06.871
you said, "Mmm, peanut butter
and chocolate, looks good."

20:07.040 --> 20:09.098
Sounds like
a group expense to me.

20:09.116 --> 20:10.616
No way. Meg, wouldn't you
call that a personal...

20:10.768 --> 20:12.710
-Uhp, she's gone.
-Yep.

20:12.861 --> 20:14.545
Guess we're covering
her neck pillow, huh?

20:20.369 --> 20:23.054
Oh, gang, we got
another postcard from Meg.

20:23.205 --> 20:25.205
"Dear Mom and Dad,

20:25.332 --> 20:27.874
"I've contracted rinderpest,

20:27.894 --> 20:30.135
"also known as cattle plague,

20:30.288 --> 20:32.471
"which has been eradicated
from most of the world,

20:32.640 --> 20:34.306
"except from here.

20:34.459 --> 20:36.959
They say I'm a local now,
ha-ha."

20:37.052 --> 20:39.237
Aw, I'm just glad
she's having fun.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.721
Yeah, and thank God

20:40.740 --> 20:42.907
everything worked out
between me and Stephanie,

20:43.058 --> 20:45.910
so I can finally put all that
middle school baggage behind me.

20:46.137 --> 20:47.411
And maybe I can start putting

20:47.488 --> 20:49.730
some of my other baggage
behind me.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.065
Peter, we need to talk.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.476
I think this relationship has...

20:53.569 --> 20:55.978
If you leave me
I will kill myself.

20:55.997 --> 20:57.463
(sighs)

20:58.833 --> 21:00.591
I love us.
