WEBVTT

00:53.095 --> 00:54.721
Why did you wanna hide this?

00:57.432 --> 00:59.059
- Who is it?
- Porter.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.436
Two secs.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.614
Thanks.

01:24.543 --> 01:28.088
I'm guessing he had his skull crushed in
with the butt of his own shotgun.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.841
It couldn't have been easy.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.887
Marnes was made of iron, anger and spite.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.096
Who are you?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.473
- This is Paul Billings. He's your--
- Oh.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.100
That's the guy you wanted to be sheriff.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.894
He's your new Chief Deputy.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.896
The old one's not even cold.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.198
Well, Marnes was right.
Someone really wanted him dead.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.825
Do we have control of this?

01:56.825 --> 01:59.828
- His door was open. A neighbor found him.
- Can we keep a lid on it?

01:59.828 --> 02:00.746
We could try.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.080
If we don't, we're fucked.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.005
This could've all been avoided
if our new sheriff had posted someone

02:10.005 --> 02:13.175
- to watch Marnes tonight.
- Your new sheriff offered, and he said no.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.469
- So I heard. You should've ignored him.
- Oh, you heard, huh?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.888
Yeah. I stopped by
and saw him and his bloody nose.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.807
- Who gave him a bloody nose?
- One of his many fans.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.727
It's the mortuary team.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.774
All right, let's go to my office.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.317
My new office.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.992
Can you tell them to give me a minute?

02:41.745 --> 02:42.829
One minute.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.117
Hey, uh, you can go in.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.503
I'm only gonna be mayor for a few months,

04:12.503 --> 04:18.007
so I'm gonna try to drink as much
of Mayor Jahns's liquor as I can.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.600
Hmm.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.106
So...

04:35.567 --> 04:37.945
What do we do?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.988
Just keeping pumping the official line.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.407
Two older people walked the Silo,
it was too much for them.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.326
- See your doctor--
- No, we bury them together.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.494
Sorry, what?

04:45.494 --> 04:48.789
One funeral. One grave.
Conservation of resources.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.875
Times like this, people don't
give a shit about conservation.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.254
But...

04:57.089 --> 04:59.508
- we could say they were in love.
- Were they?

04:59.508 --> 05:01.885
The way they nagged
at each other, I always wondered.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.470
Mmm. Doesn't matter, though.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.890
I don't know if there's anything
in the Pact about a double funeral.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.142
- Paul?
- For a married couple, but, um--

05:09.142 --> 05:11.562
- The mayor can make an exception.
- Why would the mayor do that?

05:11.562 --> 05:13.355
So it becomes the story, Rob.

05:14.481 --> 05:18.944
A couple of old servants of the Silo,
enjoying a late bloom of love,

05:18.944 --> 05:21.321
looking to spend
their golden years together,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.907
only to have their lives
cut tragically short.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.743
If they were in a relationship,
it was unsanctioned.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.412
At their age, who gives a fuck?

05:28.996 --> 05:33.500
And if people do care, it's even better.
Gets people talking about forbidden love.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.170
Anything but murder.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.838
We need a distraction.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.548
It's a good idea, Sheriff.

05:39.548 --> 05:43.468
For a distraction, the judge suggested
we offer a Forgiveness Holiday.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.722
- It's good for morale.
- It's good for Judicial.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.685
Now, let's push
the story that they were in love.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.022
Then I am going to announce
a Race to the Top.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.609
Say Mayor Jahns loved a good footrace.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.819
Award the Jahns trophy to the victor.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.991
People love an excuse
to drink beer and yell.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.743
Jahns hated those races.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.828
She always thought
they would get out of hand.

06:09.828 --> 06:10.913
Hmm.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.711
I'll let you two go. Get some sleep.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.005
Sheriff, would you stay a minute?

06:26.053 --> 06:29.056
You know, you're the reason
I stopped by to see Marnes last night.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.226
I said we should make Paul sheriff now.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.144
Marnes said to wait.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.189
Not because he thought you'd succeed.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.399
He figured you'd realize
you were in over your head

06:39.399 --> 06:41.527
and slink back down
to Greasetown on your own.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.696
All right. All right, that's enough.
Give it a rest, Rob.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.421
You don't like it.

07:02.589 --> 07:07.344
I'm installing Billings as Chief Deputy
without your say-so.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.556
Have you read the Pact?

07:11.640 --> 07:12.641
Yeah, some of it.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.560
Start with the section on your department.

07:14.560 --> 07:19.273
It doesn't explicitly say
that a sheriff should kiss Judicial's ass,

07:19.273 --> 07:22.860
but it's pretty much
the subtext on every page.

07:59.938 --> 08:00.939
Um...

08:01.732 --> 08:05.235
This morning, I ran a program

08:05.235 --> 08:11.491
to create a data set
of Silo residents under the age of 46.

08:12.492 --> 08:18.957
A number I arrived at
by taking 40 and adding 6.

08:19.458 --> 08:24.046
Forty being the amount of years
that Ruth Jahns served as mayor,

08:24.046 --> 08:28.634
and six being the age
of basic societal awareness,

08:28.634 --> 08:30.344
giving a total...

08:31.595 --> 08:37.058
of 5,496 Silo residents

08:37.726 --> 08:42.063
out of the current population of 10,112,

08:42.773 --> 08:47.861
for whom Ruth Jahns
was the only mayor they ever knew.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.363
Mm-hmm.

08:49.363 --> 08:53.158
Mayor Jahns was a trusted
and beloved leader

08:53.659 --> 08:58.497
because she knew
the residents of the Silo,

08:59.122 --> 09:00.332
and they knew her.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.128
Thankfully, I am but an interim mayor

09:05.128 --> 09:08.507
until someone can be elected

09:09.007 --> 09:12.636
to fill Ruth Jahns's very large shoes.

09:13.428 --> 09:18.851
Um, and not her literal shoes
because she--

09:18.851 --> 09:22.020
Actually, her feet were rather small.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.692
Hmm.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.402
Uh, Sheriff.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.155
Would you like to say a few words
about Deputy Marnes?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.036
Um...

09:39.746 --> 09:41.748
I honestly don't know
what to say about Marnes.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.920
He and I didn't exactly, um, hit it off.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.674
He, uh, he didn't want me as, um, sheriff.

09:51.383 --> 09:55.095
I think he shared that
with a lot of people, I guess.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.099
I didn't want the job at first.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.269
But then I was told that if
the mayor asks you to serve,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.313
you-you serve.

10:05.981 --> 10:10.152
And here I am,
speaking at Marnes's burial,

10:10.152 --> 10:12.738
in front of people
who knew him better than I did.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.781
Sad people.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.453
I'm not-- I'm not sad.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.581
I, um-- I mean, it's--
it's sad that he died, of course.

10:23.165 --> 10:26.210
But his--
His life, their lives, they, um--

10:27.628 --> 10:28.879
they're worth celebrating.

10:30.422 --> 10:35.594
They dedicated their lives to the Silo,
like we all do every day.

10:35.594 --> 10:40.682
Like everyone does,
from the Up Top to the Down Deep.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.529
Hear us, oh, Founders.

10:55.155 --> 11:00.244
Ruth Jahns and Samuel Marnes
served your Silo with their spirit,

11:01.954 --> 11:05.749
and now will serve with their flesh.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.503
Death into life.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.674
Circle without end.

12:07.769 --> 12:08.937
Hank?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.316
- Jules.
- Hey.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.359
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

12:14.359 --> 12:18.739
Oh, I, uh-- I got an invite to the burial.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.116
Really? I didn't see you there.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.077
Yeah. Um, funerals aren't really my thing.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.206
Yeah, they're not really anyone's thing.

12:27.206 --> 12:29.208
I'll pay my respects heading back down.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.837
Walk said that, uh,

12:34.379 --> 12:36.507
you found somebody
to help with the George stuff?

12:37.299 --> 12:38.717
Yeah, we buried him today.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.677
- Marnes?
- Mmm.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.554
Shit.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.434
Hey. Are, um--
those supposed to be for me?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.145
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

12:54.566 --> 12:58.487
Look, you can't send a guy up 144 levels
with a tin of hush puppies

12:58.487 --> 13:00.739
- and not expect him to eat a couple.
- There's one left.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.157
- I'm a big guy.
- Mmm.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.583
- How are you?
- Good. Yeah, I'm okay.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.130
Walk sent you, didn't she?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.677
Yeah, and Shirley.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.680
Yeah. 'Cause they're worried about me?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.933
Jules,
everybody's worried about everything.

13:29.351 --> 13:32.020
On the way up,
I said hey to my cousin on 72,

13:32.020 --> 13:36.316
and he asked if, um,
it's safe for his kids to go to school.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.112
- It's a dangerous time in the Silo and--
- And you're wondering if I can do this.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.613
No, that's not what I'm saying.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.368
- It's what it sounds like.
- Hey, would you listen to me?

13:47.995 --> 13:50.414
I know you can do anything
you put your mind to.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.667
But I also know
that none of us can do any of this alone.

13:54.418 --> 13:58.630
Now, look, I've never won
Deputy of the Year or nothing,

13:58.630 --> 14:01.758
but if you need anything,

14:03.260 --> 14:04.887
I'm just a tin of hush puppies away.

14:11.018 --> 14:11.852
Deputy.

14:13.729 --> 14:14.730
Sheriff.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.651
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

16:19.271 --> 16:20.272
I don't like you.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.984
- I got that.
- You're not qualified to be sheriff.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.903
Can't disagree. Anything else?

16:25.903 --> 16:28.739
Holston Becker was
the best sheriff this Silo's ever seen.

16:28.739 --> 16:31.408
Marnes told me that something happened
between you two,

16:31.408 --> 16:33.660
and that's why Holston went out to clean.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.663
Hmm. Well, Marnes was wrong.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.251
You took this job to find out
who killed George Wilkins.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.380
When Wilkins died,
the Down Deep deputy sent a message.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.051
Said an engineer named Nichols
claimed Wilkins was murdered.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.263
Now the first thing you do when you
get up here is ask for Wilkins' file.

16:55.807 --> 17:00.103
Here's the deal.
Everything in this office goes through me.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.356
Yeah, you wanna get anything done,

17:02.356 --> 17:05.858
whether it's find out who killed Wilkins
or get a new pencil,

17:06.734 --> 17:08.111
you're gonna do what I want.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.280
What's that?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.199
Find out who killed Marnes.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.826
Right. That's my job, so...

17:14.826 --> 17:17.704
I don't mean just going along
with whatever patsy Judicial serves up.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.040
- I mean, find out who really did it.
- Why would Judicial serve up a patsy?

17:22.209 --> 17:24.877
Because Judge Meadows
doesn't give a shit about the truth.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.674
No, the only thing she cares about
is maintaining order.

17:29.258 --> 17:31.635
And when a mayor
and a deputy get murdered,

17:32.928 --> 17:35.514
things could get disorderly fast.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.892
No, they're gonna wanna find
the nearest warm body to pin it on.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.185
Expect you to go along with it,

17:40.185 --> 17:42.479
so you can keep the shiny badge
and the nice apartment.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.940
But that would be a mistake on your part,

17:44.940 --> 17:47.693
because they also wanna get you out
and Billings in.

17:48.569 --> 17:49.736
Isn't that what you want?

17:52.030 --> 17:55.784
Honestly, I may want you
to find out who killed Marnes,

17:55.784 --> 17:58.370
but Marnes, he wouldn't give a shit.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.832
He just wouldn't want
Judicial sending some poor bastard

18:01.832 --> 18:03.750
out to clean that doesn't deserve it.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.641
I'll be back after lunch.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.351
Where are you going?

18:22.728 --> 18:24.771
I'm gonna try and figure out
who killed Marnes.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.024
Well, you should take
Deputy Billings with you.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.027
He knows the Pact, and you don't.

18:30.027 --> 18:32.029
If you get this wrong,
even if you get who did it,

18:32.029 --> 18:33.739
Judicial will throw it out.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.076
Let's go.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.518
Hey.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.311
You Charles Martin?

19:04.895 --> 19:05.729
What if I am?

19:05.729 --> 19:07.940
You rob a string of apartments
15 years ago?

19:07.940 --> 19:09.525
I did my time.

19:09.525 --> 19:11.193
We just wanna know
where you were last night.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.904
- You asking if I killed Marnes?
- Didn't say anything about--

19:13.904 --> 19:15.697
Don't tell me he died naturally.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.493
If Marnes just had a heart attack,
then life really sucks.

19:21.495 --> 19:22.913
But it wasn't me.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.667
I've been down on 62, getting tests.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.544
Okay.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.254
Thank you.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.799
Even if he wasn't in the hospital,

19:33.799 --> 19:35.634
I'm sure he wouldn't have
been a match for Marnes.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.719
You saw his hand? He's got the Syndrome.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.055
Where next?

19:44.059 --> 19:45.644
- What?
- Where-- Where do you live?

19:46.186 --> 19:49.231
- A couple levels down.
- Okay. Why don't you go home for lunch?

19:49.231 --> 19:51.942
I'm sure your wife and your daughter
would love to see you.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.026
It's only 11:00.

19:53.861 --> 19:55.237
I know. It's just...

19:55.863 --> 19:59.157
it's been a lot, and, um, I need a moment.

19:59.783 --> 20:03.287
I'm gonna grab a sandwich, read the Pact.
I hear great things about it.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.290
I'll be back in the office by 1:00.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.803
I stopped by and saw him
and his bloody nose.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.513
Who gave him a bloody nose?

20:21.513 --> 20:23.265
One of his many fans.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.476
Patrick, we all knew she was headed
for the farm the minute she met you.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.001
Patrick Kennedy, it's the sheriff.
Can you open up?

22:48.660 --> 22:49.870
Who are you looking for?

22:52.539 --> 22:53.624
Patrick Kennedy.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.209
He's not here.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.553
"...serious violations,

23:07.137 --> 23:09.181
both of which
will be initially investigated

23:09.181 --> 23:13.894
by the Department of the Sheriff, being
reported to Judicial within one hour."

23:13.894 --> 23:15.729
Read the part about accountability.

23:17.523 --> 23:19.233
- Yes?
- It's Paul Billings.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.111
Come in, Paul.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.492
Paul, you know Doug Trumbull.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.996
- Of course.
- Doug's a candidate to be my shadow.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.918
We'll get to the rest of this later.

23:49.179 --> 23:51.640
Doug Trumbull? Your shadow?

23:51.640 --> 23:53.934
I only said he's a candidate.

23:53.934 --> 23:57.104
He asked if he could be considered.
I didn't have the heart to say no.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.274
Besides, it's always good
to have an excuse to read the Pact.

24:02.359 --> 24:06.196
Our new sheriff okay with you coming back
to Judicial your first day on the job?

24:06.196 --> 24:07.614
She thinks I went home for lunch.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.492
What can I do for you?

24:34.057 --> 24:36.185
- Hey, Kennedy.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

24:36.185 --> 24:38.478
Maintenance said
this is where I'd find you.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.355
Mmm.
I was sad to hear about Deputy Marnes.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.193
I'm kidding. I was fucking giddy.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.906
Yesterday you said there were two reasons
why we were stupid

24:48.906 --> 24:50.699
for wanting to talk to your wife.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.619
First was, she's dead.
Uh, what's the second one?

24:55.621 --> 24:57.831
You know what, I'm a little confused.
Are you arresting me?

24:57.831 --> 24:59.666
- Nope.
- Then what are you doing?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.126
I'm putting you somewhere safe.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.758
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hi.

25:14.056 --> 25:16.433
- How's it going?
- Slowly.

25:17.893 --> 25:20.270
As much as I revere that thing,
if I can't sleep,

25:20.270 --> 25:22.231
- I read a couple pages and I'm out.
- Mmm.

25:23.732 --> 25:26.193
- How was lunch?
- Can I sit?

25:30.072 --> 25:33.158
I didn't go home. I went to Judicial.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.494
Oh, wow. Reporting to Sims already?

25:35.494 --> 25:37.246
I didn't know
I'd fucked up that badly yet.

25:37.246 --> 25:39.081
I know it's gonna take a lot
to earn your trust,

25:39.081 --> 25:41.917
and this might not be the best first step.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.461
But I wanted to see
how their investigation was going.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.129
Judicial has its own investigation?

25:46.129 --> 25:48.131
They get level rep reports first.

25:48.799 --> 25:52.719
And they get reports from people
who don't officially exist.

25:52.719 --> 25:53.887
Right, listeners.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.223
Not what we call them, but yeah.

25:56.974 --> 25:59.059
- What do you call them?
- Friends of the Silo.

25:59.643 --> 26:00.644
Hmm.

26:00.644 --> 26:03.021
None of what they say
is admissible in court.

26:04.565 --> 26:05.566
But...

26:06.358 --> 26:07.860
They can provide suggestions.

26:07.860 --> 26:11.864
- Wow, you look in pain just saying that.
- It's not in the Pact, so I don't like it.

26:12.698 --> 26:15.158
Hmm. Who are the friends suggesting?

26:16.159 --> 26:17.619
Ralf Melby.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.163
He works down in Paper, first shift.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.833
He could've made it to the Mids
to poison their water,

26:22.833 --> 26:25.252
he could've made it up last night
to get Marnes.

26:25.252 --> 26:29.256
"Gambler, thief, two minor assaults."
Why-- Why now?

26:29.256 --> 26:30.716
Have to ask him.

26:35.012 --> 26:37.431
Hey, Sandy,
can you get me an arrest warrant?

26:37.431 --> 26:39.016
- For who?
- Patrick Kennedy.

26:39.016 --> 26:41.852
- What? No. Ralf Melby.
- Kennedy first.

26:41.852 --> 26:44.146
And then can you call me
on the radio once you have it?

26:44.146 --> 26:47.608
- Where are you going?
- You got messages. Um. Hey.

26:49.443 --> 26:50.444
Hey.

26:51.028 --> 26:53.238
Nichols, can you just stop?

26:54.489 --> 26:56.491
- Hey.
- I don't have time for messages--

26:56.491 --> 27:00.704
I don't have any fucking messages.
I just-- I need to know what's going on.

27:02.581 --> 27:06.835
Billings went to his friends in Judicial
and came back with a name. Ralf Melby.

27:06.835 --> 27:09.087
They want me to waste my time
arresting Melby

27:09.087 --> 27:10.380
while they get their patsy.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.465
- Patrick Kennedy.
- Yeah.

27:11.465 --> 27:12.925
That's gonna make me look incompetent,

27:12.925 --> 27:15.761
they'll send me back to Mechanical,
and Billings gets the badge.

27:16.261 --> 27:18.222
You sure they're setting up Kennedy?

27:18.222 --> 27:20.682
I know a search is gonna turn up
rat poison

27:20.682 --> 27:22.142
and a drawing from Marnes's wall.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.185
How do you know that?

27:24.895 --> 27:27.648
If he's their patsy,
you requesting an arrest warrant

27:27.648 --> 27:30.025
means Judicial's gonna send a goon
to get him right away.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.109
That's why I'm going.

27:32.861 --> 27:39.034
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

27:42.037 --> 27:44.081
All the best to competitors.

27:53.924 --> 27:56.301
Judicial. Open up.

27:57.302 --> 27:58.554
Looking for Patrick Kennedy?

27:59.888 --> 28:02.683
Yeah, it took a while for Housing
to find out his wife died last year.

28:02.683 --> 28:04.685
They moved him to a single, like,
six months ago

28:04.685 --> 28:06.562
and moved an older couple in here.

28:06.562 --> 28:09.648
Maybe that's why Judicial's database
still has this down as his place.

28:09.648 --> 28:10.732
I don't know.

28:11.233 --> 28:13.610
I only know this 'cause Marnes and I
came here yesterday.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.196
I guess everyone makes mistakes, right?

28:17.322 --> 28:19.575
Yours was planting evidence
in the wrong apartment.

28:26.039 --> 28:26.957
Hey!

28:34.840 --> 28:35.841
Watch it!

28:47.019 --> 28:48.478
Go! Get out--

29:33.857 --> 29:36.777
- What are you doing? Asshole.
- Hey! What the fuck?

30:20.821 --> 30:21.947
Mommy, look.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.631
- There's someone up there.
- Watch out!

30:39.631 --> 30:40.883
Somebody help her!

30:46.722 --> 30:48.599
- Somebody help her!
- Hey, somebody help her!

31:06.116 --> 31:07.117
Go.

31:19.671 --> 31:21.715
<i>I think I know who it was
you were chasing.</i>

31:21.715 --> 31:25.010
Doug Trumbull, Judicial Security.
I'll get an arrest warrant.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.930
I wish you waited for me to come with you.

31:27.930 --> 31:30.474
Well, I was just gonna
check out Kennedy's apartment.

31:30.474 --> 31:32.809
I didn't think someone was gonna try
and throw me over the rail.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.982
Hey, what apartment number
did you have for Kennedy?

31:38.982 --> 31:40.776
2215, why?

31:41.693 --> 31:44.112
I think maybe Kennedy didn't have
anything to do with this.

32:19.439 --> 32:22.150
Douglas. What are you doing here?

32:23.861 --> 32:26.947
- I followed you once.
- Ah, that shows initiative.

32:27.698 --> 32:28.949
Skill.

32:29.616 --> 32:32.077
And a very troubling insubordination.

32:33.704 --> 32:34.663
I'm sorry.

32:34.663 --> 32:37.457
Do you have any idea
what's behind this door?

32:38.041 --> 32:39.751
- No, sir.
- Good.

32:40.335 --> 32:43.046
If I choose you to shadow me,
you will know.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.506
What happened to your hand?

32:49.011 --> 32:51.054
- You have the note?
- Yeah.

32:58.729 --> 33:01.565
Good. I think there's still a way
to make this work.

33:01.565 --> 33:03.483
- How?
- Let me figure that out.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.905
This is my favorite time.

33:09.948 --> 33:12.326
So quiet, so still.

33:14.036 --> 33:16.788
Now, Douglas, that door I came out of,

33:18.332 --> 33:22.044
first time I saw it,
my father showed it to me.

33:24.421 --> 33:25.672
He was a janitor.

33:26.673 --> 33:30.093
People looked down on him. On our family.

33:30.761 --> 33:33.180
We all know the philosophy of the Pact.

33:33.722 --> 33:36.808
Everyone contributes
to the survival of the Silo.

33:38.101 --> 33:40.145
But a janitor's still a janitor.

33:43.524 --> 33:45.734
And I was just a janitor's boy.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.363
My mother treated my father
like he was nothing,

33:49.363 --> 33:51.323
and he said nothing in return.

33:53.242 --> 33:58.580
When I was 14, I got into a conflict
with one of my classmates.

33:59.248 --> 34:02.125
Richard Elliot. Ah, he tormented me.

34:02.626 --> 34:03.836
My father found out,

34:03.836 --> 34:07.714
and I was terrified he was gonna try to do
something about it and only make it worse.

34:08.632 --> 34:09.632
But he didn't.

34:12.469 --> 34:14.263
Part of me was disappointed.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.724
Then one day, I get to school

34:19.268 --> 34:20.768
and Richard Elliot's crying.

34:21.270 --> 34:25.524
Seems his father's been reassigned
to a job on 125, and they have to move.

34:25.524 --> 34:28.902
Just like that, my problem went away.

34:31.405 --> 34:32.614
I was wondering if...

34:35.158 --> 34:38.036
if maybe my dad
had something to do with it.

34:40.289 --> 34:43.833
But he was just a janitor. Right?

34:45.543 --> 34:49.339
Then, one morning, he says to me,

34:51.132 --> 34:52.967
"Any more problems with that bully?"

34:54.011 --> 34:56.429
I just looked at him.
It was something in the way he said it.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.432
I just looked at him and asked, "How?"

35:00.684 --> 35:04.938
He said he wanted to show me something.
He took me to that door.

35:05.522 --> 35:07.608
He said if I wanted to shadow him,

35:07.608 --> 35:11.862
I would have to make a decision
that would change my life forever.

35:13.655 --> 35:15.365
If I went through that door,

35:15.365 --> 35:18.202
I could never tell anyone
what was on the other side.

35:18.827 --> 35:21.997
Not my friends, not my family,
not my wife.

35:22.581 --> 35:27.127
They might think that I was nothing
more than a bookkeeper, or a clerk,

35:27.127 --> 35:28.253
or a janitor.

35:29.963 --> 35:31.256
But I would know the truth.

35:32.007 --> 35:33.800
That the people behind that door

35:35.135 --> 35:38.222
do the most important work of the Silo.

35:40.724 --> 35:43.727
Work that keeps 10,000 people alive.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.066
You fucked up, Doug.

35:50.192 --> 35:53.362
Twice. Very badly.

35:54.571 --> 35:57.407
- You fucked up with George Wilkins...
- You know what happened?

35:57.407 --> 35:59.660
...and you fucked up with Patrick Kennedy.

36:03.205 --> 36:06.792
But I've fucked up worse. Many times.

36:08.126 --> 36:11.338
We're human beings doing the best we can.

36:12.422 --> 36:16.969
What I'm looking for in a shadow
is drive and dedication.

36:19.555 --> 36:20.889
I've made my decision.

36:25.310 --> 36:30.983
Douglas Trumbull, do you, of clear mind
and conscience, pledge to be my shadow?

36:31.608 --> 36:32.484
Yes.

36:33.652 --> 36:39.241
Are you willing to do anything to serve
and protect the people of the Silo?

36:39.867 --> 36:40.951
Yes.

36:40.951 --> 36:44.371
Are you willing
to give everything you have

36:45.581 --> 36:48.709
to serve and protect
the people of the Silo?

36:48.709 --> 36:49.793
Yes.

36:49.793 --> 36:50.878
Good.

36:53.547 --> 36:55.340
No!

37:03.599 --> 37:06.602
Douglas Trumbull
killed Mayor Jahns and Deputy Marnes,

37:06.602 --> 37:08.854
and he wanted to frame Patrick Kennedy
for the murders.

37:08.854 --> 37:12.107
His intent wasn't only to, uh,
frame Kennedy,

37:12.107 --> 37:14.568
but to kill him
and make it look like suicide.

37:14.568 --> 37:16.737
So when I confronted Trumbull

37:16.737 --> 37:21.408
about planting evidence in an apartment
no longer occupied by Kennedy, he ran.

37:22.159 --> 37:24.453
Last night,
knowing his arrest was inevitable,

37:25.287 --> 37:26.663
Trumbull took his own life.

37:26.663 --> 37:30.417
There's a-- There's a note in there
that we, uh, found in his pocket.

37:31.126 --> 37:36.089
We think he was gonna plant it on Kennedy.
Strangely, it kinda works for him too.

37:37.591 --> 37:38.842
We, um, we don't know--

37:38.842 --> 37:40.260
Why.

37:40.260 --> 37:44.097
You don't know why
a seven-year employee of Judicial

37:44.097 --> 37:46.016
would want to murder the mayor and Marnes.

37:46.016 --> 37:48.227
Well, no, but we--

37:48.227 --> 37:50.521
I didn't work closely with Trumbull,
but I saw no sign of it.

37:51.188 --> 37:53.815
Mr. Sims, did you see any indication?

37:54.525 --> 37:58.028
I mean, Marnes was deputy in the Mids back
in the day when Trumbull was growing up.

37:58.028 --> 38:01.823
Maybe-- Maybe they had some
rough encounters back then.

38:01.823 --> 38:03.617
I don't know. We're gonna look into it.

38:07.162 --> 38:08.747
Don't spend any more time on him.

38:09.498 --> 38:12.584
We have the killer of Mayor Jahns
and Deputy Marnes, and...

38:14.670 --> 38:15.671
...he's dead.

38:18.632 --> 38:21.134
This should quell the rumors
and conspiracy theories.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.344
Indeed.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:29.434 --> 38:32.604
I'll take the rat poison to the farms,
you take the rest to the office?

38:32.604 --> 38:33.689
Yep.

38:36.817 --> 38:39.319
You already knew that the drawing
and the rat poison

38:39.319 --> 38:41.029
were in the apartment before we looked.

38:41.029 --> 38:43.198
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you go in?

38:43.782 --> 38:46.034
When you were talking
to your Judicial friends.

38:46.034 --> 38:49.413
- How'd you get in?
- I learned some things in Mechanical.

38:49.413 --> 38:51.164
You clearly
didn't read the section of the Pact

38:51.164 --> 38:54.084
- about illegal search and seizure.
- No, I did.

38:54.084 --> 38:55.502
Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing?

38:56.253 --> 38:58.589
- 'Cause I didn't trust you.
- Do you now?

38:59.173 --> 39:02.134
Yeah. Sure. As much as you trust me.

39:15.981 --> 39:20.110
So you don't worry what happened
to me tomorrow, I've been reassigned.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.947
- What?
- To the station on 105.

39:25.616 --> 39:26.700
Why?

39:27.659 --> 39:28.827
I requested it.

39:30.495 --> 39:31.663
'Cause of me?

39:32.623 --> 39:34.291
No, I've got family down there.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.089
Wait, so when--
when you said if I wanted your help,

39:41.089 --> 39:43.091
I had to find out who killed Marnes.

39:43.967 --> 39:49.264
Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't think
you'd be able to do that, really.

39:51.475 --> 39:53.060
Any chance you'd change your mind?

39:53.060 --> 39:56.480
No, I've had enough of the Up Top.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.150
You know,
there are a few things I'll miss,

40:01.735 --> 40:03.487
but I won't miss the feeling
I'm being watched.

40:05.322 --> 40:06.156
By who?

40:07.866 --> 40:09.201
I don't know by who.

40:10.494 --> 40:11.578
Or how.

40:13.121 --> 40:19.211
Hey. You know, when I got here, you said
you didn't know what Down Deepers ate.

40:19.878 --> 40:21.004
You got family on 105?

40:21.004 --> 40:22.673
That's lower Mids, not Down Deep.

40:22.673 --> 40:23.966
- Right.
- Our kind don't eat babies.

40:23.966 --> 40:25.300
Mm-hmm.

40:28.387 --> 40:29.471
You did a good thing.

40:32.099 --> 40:36.812
I mean, Patrick Kennedy's an awful
human being but he didn't deserve to die.

40:36.812 --> 40:39.606
- Not for something he didn't do.
- I'm just happy that I didn't--

40:39.606 --> 40:41.942
Don't make a big deal out of it.
I still don't like you.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.028
Sheriff.

40:55.956 --> 40:57.457
<i>Can I pour you a drink?</i>

40:57.457 --> 41:00.502
I'm going through Mayor Jahns's collection
pretty fast.

41:00.502 --> 41:02.296
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- You sure?

41:02.296 --> 41:04.256
- Yeah.
- Have a seat.

41:08.719 --> 41:14.099
Now, as much as I hate to give Sims
the satisfaction,

41:14.099 --> 41:16.351
I think he may have been right.

41:16.351 --> 41:18.604
The Race to the Top was a good tonic,

41:18.604 --> 41:21.273
but what we really need
is a Forgiveness Holiday.

41:22.482 --> 41:25.652
People go a little wild when we have one,

41:25.652 --> 41:28.113
so I'm gonna need you
and your deputies everywhere.

41:29.865 --> 41:30.866
Okay.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.952
That's not the only thing
I wanted to discuss.

41:34.995 --> 41:39.583
I wanted to say that I was wrong
about you.

41:40.584 --> 41:46.089
I didn't see why Holston would want you
to be sheriff, but now I think I do.

41:46.089 --> 41:48.258
So, for as long as I'm mayor,

41:48.842 --> 41:52.846
which I sincerely hope won't be
for more than a few months,

41:53.972 --> 41:56.350
I wanna help you in any way I can.

41:56.934 --> 41:58.393
Is there anything you need now?

42:01.313 --> 42:05.400
- Two days off.
- You've been sheriff for a minute?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.319
I need to get back down to Mechanical.

42:07.319 --> 42:09.988
I didn't think I'd last
so, I didn't pack much, so...

42:09.988 --> 42:11.907
We have porters that can do that.

42:11.907 --> 42:15.410
I'd like to say goodbyes
and stuff, you know?

42:15.410 --> 42:18.789
All right. We'll see you in a couple days.

42:20.290 --> 42:21.291
Thanks.

42:40.936 --> 42:42.187
Hey.

42:42.938 --> 42:44.022
Hey.

42:44.857 --> 42:46.191
What are you working on?

42:48.068 --> 42:49.278
You wanna come see?

42:58.412 --> 43:02.875
So, when it's clear at night,
there are these lights in the sky.

43:05.836 --> 43:08.172
Hmm. What are they?

43:08.172 --> 43:09.464
I have no idea.

43:10.716 --> 43:14.094
But I've been watching them long enough
to see these patterns.

43:14.094 --> 43:19.266
They repeat, like they're, uh,
like they're traveling in this big circle.

43:22.603 --> 43:23.812
Here.

43:25.814 --> 43:26.815
Here.

43:30.194 --> 43:31.195
You see it?

43:34.364 --> 43:35.741
I see a "W".

43:37.159 --> 43:39.578
- Never noticed that before.
- Yeah, well, now you have.

43:44.124 --> 43:48.003
I'll just add it to the list of
things we don't know anything about.

44:41.807 --> 44:44.393
<i>Did you know there are lights
in the sky at night?</i>

44:44.393 --> 44:45.477
<i>How do you mean?</i>

44:45.477 --> 44:49.022
Well, the display in the Up Top cafeteria
is better than ours.

44:49.022 --> 44:52.442
- What a surprise.
- There are lights in the night sky.

44:52.943 --> 44:54.027
Yeah, what are they?

44:54.736 --> 44:56.655
I thought maybe you'd know.

44:57.239 --> 44:59.867
You know, Hank ate all
but one of the hush puppies you sent.

44:59.867 --> 45:03.120
Hmm? I kinda thought he'd eat 'em all.

45:03.745 --> 45:04.872
He's a big guy.

45:06.582 --> 45:07.916
How old is this?

45:08.584 --> 45:09.585
What day is it?

45:13.046 --> 45:16.884
So, how's it going in that fancy new job
of yours up there?

45:18.218 --> 45:19.553
- Fine.
- Fine? Really?

45:19.553 --> 45:21.263
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, Tommy Marshall

45:21.263 --> 45:24.099
was working on a ventilation fan
at the foot of the stairs.

45:24.641 --> 45:28.353
This missed his head by an inch.

45:28.937 --> 45:30.898
People saw you hanging from the rails.

45:30.898 --> 45:35.027
Jules, you don't think that kind of story
gets around? What the fuck is going on?

45:35.611 --> 45:36.987
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me--

45:36.987 --> 45:38.113
No, I can't.

45:40.657 --> 45:43.869
Goddamn it.
This isn't supposed to be the deal.

45:43.869 --> 45:46.788
We're supposed to go about our business,
keeping the Silo humming,

45:46.788 --> 45:49.583
and they're not supposed to do things
like murder people.

45:49.583 --> 45:52.294
Bodies start falling,
people start asking questions.

45:52.294 --> 45:55.631
Pretty soon, asking questions turns
into demanding answers,

45:55.631 --> 45:58.425
- and if folks don't like the answers--
- Hey, hey, hey.

45:58.425 --> 46:01.261
You're talking about rebellion?
I'm right here. I'm sheriff.

46:01.887 --> 46:02.721
Ridiculous.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.975
Anyway, did you find
that hard drive you were looking for?

46:06.975 --> 46:09.269
No, not yet. Holston hid a file on George,

46:09.269 --> 46:11.522
but there was nothing in it
that I didn't already know.

46:12.689 --> 46:14.399
Did you make headway
with the thing I left you?

46:14.399 --> 46:15.484
Yes, I did.

46:16.109 --> 46:19.613
So, I recognized the type of lens

46:19.613 --> 46:23.116
from those cameras they use
to make pictures for ID's.

46:23.116 --> 46:27.621
But those are very simple.
This-- This is not simple.

46:29.289 --> 46:30.290
Take a look.

46:36.713 --> 46:37.756
This help you?

46:40.050 --> 46:41.927
No. You got anything more powerful?

46:41.927 --> 46:45.055
Like the thing your mother made?
Lining up two lenses?

46:45.055 --> 46:46.640
Yeah, like we used on the rabbit.

46:46.640 --> 46:50.352
Yeah, and Judicial destroyed it.
Do you know why Judicial destroyed it?

46:50.352 --> 46:53.021
- No.
- Have you read the Pact?

46:53.605 --> 46:55.566
No, and you're, like,
the tenth person to ask me that.

46:55.566 --> 46:58.235
Well, this is the real reason
why I wanted you to come down.

46:58.235 --> 47:01.738
For me, there are two big mysteries
about the Pact.

47:02.322 --> 47:03.490
One.

47:03.490 --> 47:07.327
They stipulate that we can't mechanize
the way we go up and down in the Silo.

47:07.327 --> 47:09.371
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- No lifts, no pulleys.

47:09.872 --> 47:14.126
Two.
No magnification beyond a certain power.

47:15.252 --> 47:18.338
So, a relic like this is gonna get you
more than a slap on the wrist.

47:18.839 --> 47:20.841
Something with wiring this small,

47:21.425 --> 47:23.343
the effect is gonna be
a lot more dramatic.

47:26.346 --> 47:30.184
And from what you're not telling me,
seems to me there's a long list of people

47:30.184 --> 47:33.729
who've died recently
under questionable circumstances.

47:33.729 --> 47:35.981
What's to stop you being
the next one on the list?

47:35.981 --> 47:36.899
I'll be careful.

47:36.899 --> 47:39.610
Put the badge in an envelope,
give it to a porter.

47:39.610 --> 47:41.737
I need to find out what happened.

47:41.737 --> 47:44.865
Two days ago, Bernard wanted nothing
more than to send me out to clean

47:44.865 --> 47:47.409
for snagging two boxes
of shitty heat tape.

47:48.410 --> 47:53.540
I solve two murders, and he can't wait
to work with me. They trust me, Walk.

47:54.541 --> 47:56.126
I need to open up an investigation

47:56.126 --> 47:58.462
that allows me to look into
what happened to George.

47:58.462 --> 48:01.173
And how are you gonna do that
without tipping them off?

48:02.174 --> 48:03.675
I gotta use the right bait.
