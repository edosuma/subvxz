00:01.230 --> 00:03.198
Previously on Elementary...

00:03.230 --> 00:04.458
You must be Andrew.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.694
Sherlock Holmes.

00:05.730 --> 00:07.231
Sorry.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.362
Joan said you were coming.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.708
It's not how I
wanted to meet you.

00:09.740 --> 00:10.764
I think I'm gonna
give it a go.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.437
What, you found
your next business?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.436
Holmes puts me on
an e-mail chain,

00:14.480 --> 00:16.277
and 36 hours
later, um...

00:16.310 --> 00:17.572
I've got a ticket
to Copenhagen.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.612
(champagne cork pops)

00:21.650 --> 00:23.140
WATSON:
Kim, right?

00:23.190 --> 00:24.316
WOMAN:
Kim Holder.

00:24.350 --> 00:27.251
So, how can
I help you?

00:27.290 --> 00:30.282
I'm looking for someone
who does what you do.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.298
A detective.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.491
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.134
Um, tell me more.

00:43.170 --> 00:46.731
Well, it's been five years
since her disappearance.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.305
The anniversary just passed.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.148
Most days I feel like no one's
even looking for her anymore.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.340
(kettle whistles)

00:53.380 --> 00:55.143
Would you like
some tea?
Mmm.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.580
So, tell me what happened.
I don't know.

00:57.620 --> 01:01.317
The last time anyone saw Jess
was inside her apartment.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.251
I, uh... I keep a file on it.

01:05.290 --> 01:08.293
Do the police have any theories?

01:08.330 --> 01:11.197
Ugh, the police, the FBI,
they've all got ideas.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.369
And how is the FBI involved?

01:13.400 --> 01:16.733
There's a man in the New York
office... Blake Tanner.

01:16.770 --> 01:20.331
He thinks Jess was abducted
by a serial criminal.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.440
This sounds strange, I know.

01:23.480 --> 01:27.268
But when Jess' roommate got
home the night she disappeared,

01:27.320 --> 01:29.345
there was a smell
In the apartment.

01:29.390 --> 01:33.349
I-It smelled like
something was baking.

01:33.390 --> 01:34.618
Like nutmeg.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.629
The thing is--
over the years,

01:37.660 --> 01:39.696
five other women
have gone missmg

01:39.730 --> 01:41.721
and never been
heard from again,

01:41.760 --> 01:45.719
and each time the place
where they disappeared from,

01:45.770 --> 01:47.738
it has the same smell.

01:47.770 --> 01:50.739
Like nutmeg.

01:50.770 --> 01:54.228
Tanner thinks the same
person took all srx women.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.249
He calls the
guy "Pumpkin."

01:57.280 --> 01:59.271
Are there
any suspects?

02:01.280 --> 02:04.488
Look, I'm a lawyer.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.488
I've worked
crImInal cases.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.353
I-I know the odds
aren't good here.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.449
But...

02:11.490 --> 02:13.651
even if Jess is...

02:13.700 --> 02:15.452
(sighs)

02:15.500 --> 02:17.468
...gone,

02:17.500 --> 02:20.833
I just want to know
what happened to her.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.375
Hi, Watson.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.469
Good morning, Kitty.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.841
I don't know
how you found me.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.404
I hope you're not
following me again.

02:31.450 --> 02:33.179
No, I just know that you like

02:33.220 --> 02:34.517
to come here to work sometimes.

02:34.550 --> 02:36.381
You know, from when
I was following you.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.445
You weren't home,
so I came here.

02:38.490 --> 02:40.458
He wants to know
what you're working on.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.378
Tell Sherlock I can't jump into
anything with you right now.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.421
He's not looking for help,
he wants to know

02:44.460 --> 02:45.552
if you got anything
interesting going.

02:45.590 --> 02:47.558
Oh, so he's bored.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.569
I just took on
a missing person's case.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.761
Could be
a serial element.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.791
Do you mind if I...?

02:59.240 --> 03:00.878
(cell phone imitates
camera noise)

03:00.910 --> 03:02.775
You're gonna text him
the article?

03:02.810 --> 03:06.576
He said I was to forward him
any particulars rIght away.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.212
(cell phone chimes)

03:08.250 --> 03:10.787
Good news--
Sherlock says that he'll help.

03:10.820 --> 03:14.756
First step is to go to the
FBI's New York field office

03:14.790 --> 03:16.485
and get our hands
on their profile.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.486
Okay, tell him
that I didn't ask for help.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.656
(cell phone chimes)

03:19.700 --> 03:20.758
What'd he say?

03:20.800 --> 03:21.824
It's not my phone.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.535
HOLMES:
Behavioral Science Unit.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.707
Even the name is pompous.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.970
Really don't know why I subject
myself to these people.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.978
Nobody is "subjecting"
you to anything.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.612
You butted in.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.618
That's the fourth time
you've looked at your phone

03:43.650 --> 03:44.787
since we've sat down.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.378
You expecting
some news?

03:46.420 --> 03:48.513
No, Andrew and I just
got cut off earlier.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.959
Just checking to
see if he called.

03:49.990 --> 03:51.548
You're frustrated.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.452
It's difficult
to maintain what has become

03:54.500 --> 03:56.388
largely a long-distance
relationship.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.660
So, it's natural to wonder
whether the difficulty

03:58.700 --> 04:00.668
in communicating is
a symptom of being apart

04:00.700 --> 04:02.429
or whether it's
the disease itself.

04:02.470 --> 04:03.960
What? I didn't
say that.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.568
Not with words.

04:05.610 --> 04:07.430
MAN:
You the P15?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.879
Detectives, yes.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.468
Blake Tanner, right this way.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.569
I've only got
a couple of minutes.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.975
So, you consult
with the NYPD,

04:15.020 --> 04:16.487
but your interest
in this is private?

04:16.520 --> 04:17.714
That's right.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.513
We were hired by one
of the relatives

04:19.560 --> 04:20.515
of the potential
victims...

04:20.560 --> 04:21.754
Victims, full stop.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.348
Nothing "potential" about it.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.585
I'm sure you're right.

04:25.630 --> 04:27.427
S-Sorry to interrupt.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.724
Agent Tanner, would you mind if
I took some of your stationary?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.920
Go right ahead.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.528
Thank you.

04:33.570 --> 04:34.832
We're not looking to
second-guess anyone;

04:34.870 --> 04:36.963
we just want to take a
look at your profile.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.332
S-Sometimes it can be useful
to get a set of fresh eyes.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.339
No offense, but we're not
hunting squirrels here.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.848
Pumpkin is big game.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.677
He's been active
for ten years,

04:48.720 --> 04:51.314
hasn't left a hint
of evidence behind.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.988
Just the olfactory signature.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.851
(chuckles)

04:54.890 --> 04:57.552
Something funny?
No, sorry.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.093
It's just (clears throat)
"olfactory signature"

05:00.130 --> 05:04.624
struck me as an ornate way
to say "the smell of nutmeg."

05:07.740 --> 05:10.106
The official policy
of the Bureau is not to share

05:10.140 --> 05:11.732
_ information
With private Investigators.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.534
We understand,
we just want to help.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.377
HOLMES:
That's fine, Watson.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.946
I don't think we need
to take up much more

05:17.980 --> 05:19.948
of this special agent's time--
he's got big game to catch.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.072
Thank you.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.580
Why did you do that?

05:26.620 --> 05:28.110
He was just about
to give us the file.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.718
Eh, you overestimate
your charms.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.580
Blake Tanner is both
arrogant and a fool.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.052
He's never gonna share
his work with us.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.692
I decided within moments
of meeting him

05:34.730 --> 05:37.096
to pursue the profile
by alternative means.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.735
He is clearly a bully
and a petty tyrant.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.738
And I suspect
he's also a credit-hog.

05:41.770 --> 05:44.136
(cell phone chimes)

05:44.170 --> 05:46.434
I noted the way his colleagues
were looking at him

05:46.480 --> 05:48.436
as he escorted us
to his back office.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.640
There was no shortage
of contempt,

05:49.680 --> 05:51.739
so I wrote short notes
to a few of them.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.578
And I'm quite confident that one
of them will relish the chance

05:54.620 --> 05:56.588
to share the profile
behind his back.
(cell phone chimes)

05:56.620 --> 05:58.087
See? Got a
copy already.
What?!

05:58.120 --> 06:00.088
(cell phone chimes)
Two, actually.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.610
(cell phone chimes)
Make that three.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.127
WATSON: Wait,
is that the profile?

06:03.160 --> 06:04.559
You're scrolling
too fast.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.955
I'm speed-reading;
you moved out

06:05.990 --> 06:07.958
before we got to that
portion of your training.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.560
Wonderful.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.828
This should give us
a good start.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.132
Is there something
helpful in there?

06:13.170 --> 06:15.968
The report is full of sophistry

06:16.000 --> 06:17.968
and various instances
of tautologlcal thinking

06:18.010 --> 06:20.171
and is generally plagued
by the kind of laziness

06:20.210 --> 06:21.575
and intellectual vanity

06:21.610 --> 06:23.805
which is native _
to the profIIer professron.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.148
So, why do you say
it's a good start?

06:26.180 --> 06:28.740
'Cause even a cursory glance at
this document has convinced me

06:28.780 --> 06:31.749
that there's _
no such person as "Pumpkin."

06:31.790 --> 06:33.451
He's a construct
of Blake Tanner's mind.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.458
A product of a profession
which is trained

06:35.490 --> 06:37.685
to look for bogeymen
in every dark corner.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.459
No, it's clear to me

06:39.500 --> 06:41.456
that each of the abductees
attributed to Pumpkin

06:41.500 --> 06:42.990
was in fact taken
by different people.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.463
The crimes aren't connected.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.559
What about
the olfactory Signature?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.033
HOLMES: I can't
explain the nutmeg.

06:48.070 --> 06:49.867
Not yet, but I do know

06:49.910 --> 06:51.866
that Blake Tanner has seized
on one detail

06:51.910 --> 06:54.572
to form a link and then woven
a web of tortured psychology

06:54.610 --> 06:56.202
in an effort _
to connect seven crimes

06:56.240 --> 06:58.003
which are, in fact,
quite separate.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.678
We're gonna discover what really
happened to Jessica Holder.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.449
And then, just for sport,

07:02.490 --> 07:03.980
we're going to explain
the nutmeg connection.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.749
And then we're gonna prove
to anyone who cares to listen

07:05.790 --> 07:07.815
that Blake Tanner has been
a fool these past five years.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.844
Have you considered
correspondence?

07:30.880 --> 07:32.518
Hmm?

07:32.550 --> 07:33.710
To alleviate your frustrations
with Andrew.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.172
I recommend
proper correspondence.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.484
Handwritten letters,

07:37.520 --> 07:38.817
informed by deliberate
and careful thought.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.852
It really is
the most direct route

07:40.890 --> 07:42.528
to meaningful
communication.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.482
I don't have frustrations
that need alleviating.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.952
Andrew and I just had
a hard time

07:45.990 --> 07:47.218
connecting this morning,
that's all.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.058
Hmm.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.694
(sighs) Please don't tell me
you have another insight

07:52.740 --> 07:54.628
about my relationship.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.638
I'm looking through this box
of Jessica Holder's belongings.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.638
She really is a very
organized person.

07:58.670 --> 08:00.501
Even the keychain is
meticulously arranged.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.701
Each one is labeled.

08:02.750 --> 08:07.039
And here we have three keys of
the exact same make and model.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.718
What does that indicate to you?

08:08.750 --> 08:09.944
My apartment keys
lookidenﬁcaL

08:09.990 --> 08:11.287
Precisely.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.753
So, if you're like most people,

08:12.790 --> 08:14.610
you've got one key
for your apartment building,

08:14.660 --> 08:15.957
one key for your
apartment proper.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.958
That's two; she has
three identical keys.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.151
This one is labeled "A,"
probably apartment building.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.156
"FD," front door.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.623
This one has no label--
wonder what it opens.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.991
We need to go to Jessica
Holder's apartment building

08:27.040 --> 08:29.964
and try every lock
until we find what this opens

08:30.010 --> 08:31.659
and then divine her connection
to whatever's inside.

08:31.710 --> 08:32.938
Let me know
when you've got it sorted.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.277
What, you're not coming?

08:34.310 --> 08:35.675
I'm here to offer help,

08:35.710 --> 08:37.575
but trying one key
in an ocean of doors,

08:37.610 --> 08:39.544
that's scut work.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.276
No, my spirit of volunteerism
is not without its limits.

08:45.590 --> 08:48.753
(Kitty hums)

08:49.630 --> 08:52.622
No luck on the fifth floor.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.835
(hums)

08:59.870 --> 09:02.259
What are you humming?

09:02.300 --> 09:03.938
Beethoven's Sixth.

09:03.970 --> 09:06.768
Clarinet part.

09:06.810 --> 09:10.598
I would not have pegged you
as a classical music fan.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.049
My dad was the fan.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.675
Which meant I practiced
four hours every day.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.188
You still play?

09:18.220 --> 09:20.211
He sold my clarinet when
I turned down a place

09:20.260 --> 09:21.852
at the Royal
Academy of Music.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.881
(door unlocks)

09:36.770 --> 09:38.761
Hello?

09:43.780 --> 09:46.772
Middle-aged couple
with a kid in college.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.218
Looks like one of
them's a lawyer.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.810
Probably him;
he looks boring.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.328
Liz, I'm home.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.827
Your wife's not
here, Mr. Kramer.

10:01.860 --> 10:04.260
Who the hell are you?

10:04.300 --> 10:07.133
We're looking into the
disappearance of Jessica Holder.

10:07.170 --> 10:08.933
How did you get in here?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.833
This key,
from Jessica's key ring.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.076
Now, why did Jessica have
a key to your apartment?

10:17.110 --> 10:19.249
I'm calling the police.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.247
I wouldn't do that.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.770
You're a
defense lawyer.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.788
We know because we
had a look around.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.812
You have had some shady clients
over the years.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.317
We found some papers
locked in your closet.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.658
Something about a criminal
negligence case.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.829
Is there any reason you kept
those hidden

10:33.860 --> 10:36.055
instead of turning
them over for discovery?

10:38.200 --> 10:41.658
So tell us about your
relationship with Jessica.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.665
I didn't want to have an affair.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.802
Not again.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.001
Jessica was right downstairs.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.677
(chuckles wryly)

10:52.720 --> 10:53.675
She was a sweet kid.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.176
Did you kill her?

10:55.220 --> 10:58.280
Of course not.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.856
Jessica disappeared in, what,

10:59.890 --> 11:00.982
October that year?

11:01.020 --> 11:02.282
October 17.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.288
I was out of state
that whole fall.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.197
I worked a class-action thing
in Oregon.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.892
I can show you my tax returns
for the receipts from that year.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.789
If you do find out
what happened to Jess,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.729
let me know, please.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.306
I miss her.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.038
DISPATCH:
We've got a 10-95 at...

11:25.080 --> 11:28.777
(indistinct radio transmissions)

11:28.820 --> 11:30.242
Ms. Hudson.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.087
What are you doing here?
Hi.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.487
Um, Sherlock asked me to keep
an ear on the police scanner

11:35.520 --> 11:38.387
and tell him if anybody mentions
the word "nutmeg."

11:38.430 --> 11:40.159
So you're on nutmeg duty?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.758
_ Mm.
Not strictly nutmeg duty.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.722
We are casting a wide net.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.397
I've asked Ms. Hudson
to notify me

11:45.430 --> 11:47.830
if she hears any mention
of the aroma of pumpkin pie

11:47.870 --> 11:49.758
at a crime scene
or any reference at all

11:49.810 --> 11:51.163
to the scent of baking.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.008
You really expect the police
to smell nutmeg?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.302
I expect nothing, which is why

11:55.340 --> 11:56.807
I'm such _
an exceptional detective.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.976
I don't know why

11:58.010 --> 11:59.170
the aroma has been present

11:59.210 --> 12:00.939
at six separate crime scenes.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.483
I also don't know that those six
are the only scenes

12:03.520 --> 12:04.817
which have smelled
of baked goods.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.886
Those are just the ones
that Blake Tanner

12:06.920 --> 12:08.785
has lumped into his specious
"Pumpkin Case."

12:08.820 --> 12:10.321
But I am curious.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.487
It's a detail
I'd like to reconcile.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.998
So Kitty's gonna look through
old records, see if she can find

12:15.030 --> 12:16.497
any additional references
to the smell,

12:16.530 --> 12:18.361
while Ms. Hudson
keeps an ear out

12:18.400 --> 12:20.436
for new appearances.
Seems like we're all set

12:20.470 --> 12:21.892
on the nutmeg front.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.362
And the disappearance
of Jessica Holder?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.934
Well, that's your territory.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.039
With my assistance, of course.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.230
Strictly on a voluntary basis.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.077
The defense attorney's alibi

12:29.110 --> 12:31.101
is sound, so it seems to me
your next step

12:31.150 --> 12:32.947
should be to look
through Jessica's belongings.

12:32.980 --> 12:35.175
Why don't you start
with her laptop?

12:35.220 --> 12:37.211
Let me know if you find
anything interesting.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.343
_ You know what? I'm not_
into this whole voluntary thing.

12:39.390 --> 12:40.550
You're either working
the case with me or not.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.182
We'll divide up the box.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.949
You take the laptop.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.787
Let me know if you find
anything interesting.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.822
(indistinct radio transmissions)

12:52.130 --> 12:53.791
MAN:
Joan?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.535
Chris.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.208
(chuckling):
Hi.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.969
Well, it's been...

12:59.010 --> 12:59.977
forever.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.376
You look great.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.549
Thanks. You, too.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.810
Um, are you still practicing
at White Peaks?

13:06.850 --> 13:09.512
15 years. I'm an old man now.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.040
(laughter)
I heard you're

13:11.090 --> 13:13.308
a private investigator?
Yes.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.885
That's why I'm lingering
outside your building.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.285
I've got a problem.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.525
Oh, nothing serious, I hope.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.824
Not really.
Someone stole my ID,

13:21.860 --> 13:23.168
my medical I.D., actually.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.020
I didn't even know
it happened

13:25.070 --> 13:26.492
until I went in for a physical,
and the doctor

13:26.530 --> 13:28.134
had the wrong blood type
on file.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.866
Sometimes this stuff is
hooked into a bigger scam.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.174
I thought if you had some time,
maybe you can,

13:33.210 --> 13:34.370
you know, figure things out?

13:34.410 --> 13:35.934
I-I'd pay you your fee.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.845
Oh, no, no,
don't worry about that.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.916
You know,
I'm a little busy right now,

13:39.950 --> 13:41.212
but I can get someone else
started on it,

13:41.250 --> 13:42.410
and then I'll jump on

13:42.450 --> 13:43.940
when I'm free.

13:43.990 --> 13:44.979
You won't take any money?

13:45.020 --> 13:46.214
No, no, don't be silly.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.956
You're a friend.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.958
(sighs)

13:49.990 --> 13:52.185
It's really good
to see you again.

13:52.230 --> 13:53.219
(buzzer blares)

13:53.260 --> 13:54.454
(door opens)

13:56.970 --> 13:58.858
So, what are we doing
at Sing Sing?

13:58.900 --> 14:00.936
All things in good time, Watson.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.098
Did you ask Kitty to look
into the medical history

14:04.140 --> 14:06.108
of a man named
Christopher Santos?

14:06.140 --> 14:07.869
It's a favor; he's a friend.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.229
We're busy, so I thought
she could look around.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.942
You've engaged in
horizontal refreshment

14:11.980 --> 14:13.117
with this man?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.015
We dated for two years.

14:16.050 --> 14:18.883
He bought me an engagement ring,
so yes,

14:18.920 --> 14:20.251
we engaged
in horizontal refreshment.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.518
Does that matter?

14:21.560 --> 14:22.982
You turned down his proposal.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.281
That's interesting.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.628
(sighs) What are we doing
at Sing Sing?

14:26.660 --> 14:28.321
I spent quite a bit of time

14:28.360 --> 14:30.965
with Jessica Holder's
laptop last night.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.968
She had a rather
interesting text file

14:33.000 --> 14:35.662
hidden away in a folder
titled "November's Bills."

14:35.700 --> 14:37.258
Her lover,

14:37.310 --> 14:38.959
Noah Kramer,

14:39.010 --> 14:41.501
represented a rather
notorious drug trafficker.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.201
Raymond Carpenter.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.376
Hmm.

14:44.410 --> 14:45.604
I know that name.

14:45.650 --> 14:46.969
Apparently,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.476
Kramer divulged to Jessica

14:48.520 --> 14:51.011
that his client was guilty
of several murders.

14:51.050 --> 14:54.019
Jessica could not live
with what she knew.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.652
She details her plans
to come forward

14:55.690 --> 14:57.351
in the document.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.381
But disappeared
before she could.

14:59.430 --> 15:03.196
I wonder, did Kramer glean
his girlfriend's plan

15:03.230 --> 15:05.926
and then pass a warning
on to his client?

15:05.970 --> 15:08.063
So you think Carpenter
had Holder killed.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.068
That's an interesting theory.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.704
Raymond Carpenter
is doing hard time here

15:12.740 --> 15:14.230
for an unrelated matter.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.204
I thought we might have a word.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.945
So, I'm sorry,

15:18.980 --> 15:21.210
you came here hoping
I'd just tell you

15:21.250 --> 15:24.083
I killed someone named
Je55ica Holder?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.145
It's not an entirely
outlandish request.

15:26.190 --> 15:29.216
You're serving life in prison
with no chance of parole.

15:29.260 --> 15:32.252
Things can't get
any worse for you.

15:32.290 --> 15:34.121
And if there's anything
you covet here in prison,

15:34.160 --> 15:35.991
one phone call
from our colleague,

15:36.030 --> 15:37.395
Captain Gregson at the NYPD,

15:37.430 --> 15:39.125
could go a very long way.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.058
You'd be giving closure

15:41.100 --> 15:43.364
to Jessica Holder's family also,
if that means anything to you.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.169
There's an inmate
greens crew here.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.576
I've been trying
to get on it for years,

15:49.610 --> 15:52.101
but the Dominicans
have got it wired.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.515
That's what you want?

15:53.550 --> 15:55.245
A chance to plant flowers?

15:55.280 --> 15:57.680
They get to go outside.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.244
A lot.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.758
Well, one phone call
from our Captain Gregson,

16:01.790 --> 16:05.578
and you'll be gardening
amongst Dominicans in no time.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.095
Kramer tipped me off.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.563
I had the girl taken care of.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.363
I don't know
where she is, though.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.163
I outsourced the job.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.236
Where can we find the killer?

16:16.270 --> 16:17.760
He's named Danny Tacelli.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.368
Last I heard,

16:19.410 --> 16:21.207
certain parts of him
were floating in the East River,

16:21.240 --> 16:23.071
certain parts were
in the Hudson.

16:23.110 --> 16:26.705
Did you tell Kramer
what you did?

16:26.750 --> 16:28.069
Not in so many words,

16:28.120 --> 16:30.281
but, I mean, the guy knew.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.685
Soon as he tipped me off,

16:31.720 --> 16:35.019
he issued that girl
a death sentence.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.413
So now what?

16:36.460 --> 16:39.054
Noah Kramer just gets away
with what he did?

16:39.090 --> 16:42.526
I suppose a zealous prosecutor
could try to make a case.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.199
But there are alternative
means of punishment.

16:45.230 --> 16:48.028
I still maintain contact
to some of your tab|0ids.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.561
"Married Attorney
Betrays Mistress

16:50.610 --> 16:52.464
to Murderous Client."

16:52.510 --> 16:55.070
We've solved the problem
that you were hired to address,

16:55.110 --> 16:56.805
but we might
still have work to do.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.569
We've had a spot of good luck.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.612
Ms. Hudson texted.

17:00.650 --> 17:03.687
Apparently, the custodian
of a Harlem band shell

17:03.720 --> 17:05.711
arrived at work this morning
to find that his structure

17:05.750 --> 17:07.388
had been marked up
with bullet holes overnight.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.149
And how is that good luck?

17:09.190 --> 17:10.726
Custodian told police
that the area

17:10.760 --> 17:13.092
smelled very strongly
of nutmeg.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.519
CUSTODIAN: Those bullet holes
weren't here yesterday.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.664
This place is pretty much

17:17.700 --> 17:20.066
an open-air drug market
after hours.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.499
Guess it was
some kind of deal

17:21.540 --> 17:23.132
gone wrong last night.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.058
Let me know
if you need anything.

17:25.110 --> 17:26.737
Thank you.

17:26.770 --> 17:29.534
(indistinct radio transmission)

17:29.580 --> 17:31.241
(sniffs)

17:31.280 --> 17:33.373
Yeah, smells like nutmeg.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.412
But does it smell
only of nutmeg?

17:36.450 --> 17:38.418
We need to plumb every nuance

17:38.450 --> 17:39.815
on this aroma,

17:39.850 --> 17:42.057
and for that we will need
The Nose.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.352
What nose? Your nose?

17:44.390 --> 17:45.687
The Nose.

17:45.730 --> 17:46.754
He's an Irregular

17:46.790 --> 17:48.223
I've used from time to time.

17:48.260 --> 17:50.569
His sense of smell outpaces
even my own.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.261
Does he have a real name?

17:53.770 --> 17:55.328
I don't know.
I've never asked him.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.099
How do two_ adults have
a relationship

17:57.140 --> 18:00.268
where one never calls the other
anything but The Nose?

18:00.310 --> 18:02.175
If you must know his real name,
you can ask him yourself.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.472
MAN: I suppose
I should be grateful,

18:03.510 --> 18:04.772
Holmes.

18:04.810 --> 18:06.346
Usually when you ask
for my help,

18:06.380 --> 18:08.519
there's a decomposing body
somewhere nearby.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.484
Hi, I'm Joan Watson.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.283
Excuse the potpourri bag.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.754
I need coffee beans
when I'm out and about.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.520
This city can be an assault
on the senses.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.824
You said something about nutmeg?

18:19.860 --> 18:21.350
Mm-hmm.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.164
Is this the spot?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.161
(sniffing)

18:34.410 --> 18:37.243
The nutmeg is dominant, yes,

18:37.280 --> 18:38.804
but it's _
the olfactory equwalent

18:38.850 --> 18:40.317
of a burlesque dancer.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.375
The pretty lady
in the spotlight,

18:42.420 --> 18:44.638
meant to distract you
from everything else

18:44.690 --> 18:46.180
that's going on.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.881
What else?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.319
Chemicals.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.454
Uh, hints of... bleach.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.321
Something metallic.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.466
Oh, there's one note
that's stronger

18:57.500 --> 18:58.797
than the rest.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.298
Sodium hydroxide.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.798
A powerful base
otherwise known as caustic soda.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.831
Suitable for the melting
of murdered bodies.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.173
Jessica Holder's murder
is connected

19:10.210 --> 19:11.643
to what happened here,
just as it's connected

19:11.680 --> 19:12.908
to every other
disappearance attributed

19:12.950 --> 19:14.349
to Pumpkin.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.745
The man who killed
Jessica Holder

19:15.780 --> 19:17.281
isn't responsible for this;
he's dead.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.242
And I thought you said there was
no serial element.

19:19.290 --> 19:20.712
There isn't.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.387
There are many
different murders committed

19:22.420 --> 19:24.251
by many different killers,

19:24.290 --> 19:27.623
but one man, the inventor
of this nutmeg concoction,

19:27.660 --> 19:30.595
was brought in to clean up
the mess every time.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.564
The crimes aren't connected
by a common killer.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.398
They're connected
by a common cleaner.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.878
So somebody commits a murder,
and you think there's a guy

19:42.910 --> 19:45.208
out there that they can call
to clean it up?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.569
We have professional
crime scene cleaners

19:46.610 --> 19:48.214
on our side of the law.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.717
Surely there'd be
a thriving market

19:49.750 --> 19:51.547
for an illicit one.
How do the killers find him?

19:51.590 --> 19:53.785
What does he got, a Yelp page?

19:53.820 --> 19:55.685
Well, obviously he or she--

19:55.720 --> 19:57.278
Watson, I would never suggest

19:57.330 --> 19:58.456
that a woman cannot
melt corpses--

19:58.490 --> 20:00.492
he relies on word of mouth.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.929
I would wager

20:01.960 --> 20:04.394
that most of the work comes
from organized crime.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.466
People for whom homicide
is a semi-regular occurrence.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.536
_ Our cleane_r _
has invented a solution which,

20:08.570 --> 20:10.800
as far as I can tell,
cleans crime scenes

20:10.840 --> 20:13.536
_ and dissolves
any inconvenient dead people.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.299
That's where the smell
comes from?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.900
The spice conceals
the harsher odors underneath.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.748
It's a nutmeg concoction
suitable for erasing

20:21.780 --> 20:23.486
any and all signs of murder.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.408
Nutmeg concoction
sounds like something

20:25.450 --> 20:26.883
my aunt would give me
for Christmas.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.353
Well, be thankful she didn't,
'cause you would

20:28.390 --> 20:29.516
have dissolved
from the inside out.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.982
You see the opportunity

20:31.030 --> 20:32.657
we have here?

20:32.690 --> 20:34.954
The FBI profiler
has unwittingly linked

20:35.000 --> 20:37.298
_ our cleaner
to SIX separate murders,

20:37.330 --> 20:40.561
but that could be just
the tip of the iceberg.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.828
He could be connected
to dozens,

20:41.870 --> 20:43.462
maybe hundreds of crimes.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.762
Imagine the information
he could provide.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.404
If he exists,
how do we find him?

20:48.440 --> 20:50.340
We'll canvass contractors

20:50.380 --> 20:52.473
_who hire out _
for crime scene cleaning

20:52.510 --> 20:54.011
and check with schools
that issue speCIal certificates

20:54.050 --> 20:55.517
in disposing biohazardous waste.

20:55.550 --> 20:56.812
(grunts)

20:59.320 --> 21:01.015
Is there something wrong
with that plan?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.709
No, perfectly sensible.
I just...

21:02.760 --> 21:05.285
It sounds a bit... dull.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.629
Oh. Where would you start?

21:12.900 --> 21:15.835
(door opens)

21:15.870 --> 21:17.861
(door closes)

21:20.580 --> 21:22.002
Oh, my God!

21:22.040 --> 21:23.541
What are you doing?

21:23.580 --> 21:24.842
Hello, Watson.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.438
I figured out who stole
your friend's identity.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.879
It's in a file on the desk.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.512
Please stop talking.
You're jostling the wound.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.313
And I'd like
the pigs' blood to coagulate

21:31.350 --> 21:32.442
a little bit.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.082
I'm taking out a
wanted ad of sorts.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.712
We theorized that our cleaner

21:35.760 --> 21:37.557
works mostly by word of mouth,
but what if he has

21:37.590 --> 21:39.455
an alternative means
of finding work?

21:39.490 --> 21:41.594
Some other way to pay the
bills when career criminals

21:41.630 --> 21:43.769
aren't murdering each other
in sufficient quantity.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.428
You've heard
of the Dark Internet, I assume?

21:46.470 --> 21:48.597
Yeah, Web sites that are
not visible to search engines.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.096
People buy drugs there.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.801
Didn't the FBI shut it down?

21:51.840 --> 21:53.979
They shut down a site
called The Silk Road.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.739
But others have
popped up in its place.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.101
And narcotics are not the
only product bought and sold

21:58.150 --> 21:59.879
on the Dark Internet.

21:59.910 --> 22:01.810
Contracts for assassinations
have been consummated there.

22:01.850 --> 22:03.989
Humans sold to the
highest bidder.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.681
I am going to post
photographs of Kitty

22:05.720 --> 22:07.813
in her current state,
and then claim to be

22:07.860 --> 22:10.454
a desperate man who's committed
a crime of passion.

22:10.490 --> 22:12.424
And hopefully our cleaner
gets in touch with you.

22:12.460 --> 22:13.722
Oh, yeah. Have fun with that.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.421
You're not gonna stay?

22:15.460 --> 22:17.428
Any luck, we'll have
our man by morning.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.562
I think I'll just stick
to the dull stuff.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.624
Thanks for your help, Kitty.

22:19.670 --> 22:20.864
Welcome.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.367
(stammers)
Pigs' blood, please!

22:22.400 --> 22:24.038
(door closes)

22:24.070 --> 22:26.834
That's the guy who stole
my medical I.D.?

22:26.870 --> 22:29.077
My colleague had
a contact run this

22:29.110 --> 22:30.407
through facial
recognition software.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.974
This guy is
all over social media.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.875
His name is Ermel Janic.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.809
Wow. You work fast.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.511
Well, you can take
all this to the police.

22:38.550 --> 22:39.744
Hopefully, it will help
clear some things up

22:39.790 --> 22:41.382
with your insurance.

22:41.420 --> 22:42.751
But you should check
all your records.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.553
Make sure he didn't
change anything else.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.820
Thanks so much
for doing this.

22:46.860 --> 22:48.452
You were always efficient
when we were together,

22:48.500 --> 22:51.389
but it looks like
you found another gear.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.068
You always had
a very interesting way

22:53.100 --> 22:54.988
of describing
my type A tendencies.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.931
Uh, now, I cringe when I think
about how immature I was.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.938
I'm not sure there's a
statute of limitation

23:00.980 --> 23:04.108
on apologies, but I'm sorry.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.902
I had a lot_to learn
about accepting people

23:05.950 --> 23:07.645
for who they are.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.944
Did you?

23:09.980 --> 23:11.516
Learn?

23:11.550 --> 23:13.484
I had to.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.953
Next time someone
great comes along,

23:14.990 --> 23:16.685
I'd like to be better...

23:16.720 --> 23:19.655
husband material.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.721
Thanks.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.559
It's great
seeing you again, Joan.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.698
What tedium is this?

23:36.740 --> 23:38.002
Oh, I stopped by the Spaulding

23:38.050 --> 23:39.699
Technical Institute
this morning.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.809
Did you know that they
issue more crime scene

23:41.850 --> 23:43.647
cleaning certificates
than anyone in New York?

23:43.690 --> 23:46.579
They agreed to let us
go through their records.

23:46.620 --> 23:49.509
Hoping the few
apparent sociopaths

23:49.560 --> 23:50.720
would leap out of the pile?

23:50.760 --> 23:52.682
Yes.

23:52.730 --> 23:53.799
You ought to make a case

23:53.830 --> 23:55.957
against whoever acquired
this mural.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.592
You can't learn
a trade with that

23:57.630 --> 23:58.995
abomination looming
over you, can you?

23:59.030 --> 24:01.066
I'm surprised
you even came down here.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.931
I thought this stuff
was too boring for you.

24:02.970 --> 24:04.767
After the events of last night,

24:04.810 --> 24:05.936
I could use the calm that a dose

24:05.970 --> 24:07.574
of routine drudgery provides.

24:07.610 --> 24:08.702
What happened last night?

24:08.740 --> 24:10.139
Well, we had what
I considered to be

24:10.180 --> 24:12.205
a promising response to my ad.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.139
So, photographs
of the supposed
mayhem were provided,

24:15.180 --> 24:16.647
a meeting was set, it was
all going rather well

24:16.680 --> 24:18.147
until the man revealed himself

24:18.190 --> 24:20.488
to be an undercover
police officer.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.818
There was a bit_ of confusion
and some wavmg of guns.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.828
Did you get arrested?

24:24.860 --> 24:26.657
The appearance of a living
Kitty did help my cause.

24:26.690 --> 24:28.226
And the phone call
to Captain Gregson

24:28.260 --> 24:29.591
secured my release.

24:29.630 --> 24:31.621
(laughs)
I still maintain
that it was

24:31.670 --> 24:33.638
a sound tactic; you
can't judge an idea just

24:33.670 --> 24:35.467
by the results
it provides, so...
(cell phone dinging)

24:37.810 --> 24:39.937
Oh, damn.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.176
Must I draw it out of you?

24:45.210 --> 24:46.677
I met with my client last night.

24:46.710 --> 24:47.938
We talked.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.538
He got the wrong impression.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.684
He asked me out for a date.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.712
Did you mention that you
were otherwise involved?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.819
No, it didn't come
up... naturally.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.782
What do you mean "naturally"?
I mean, given your history,

24:58.830 --> 25:00.024
it's hardly surprising
you've allowed this

25:00.060 --> 25:01.698
to happen at the
very same moment

25:01.730 --> 25:03.049
that your relationship
with Andrew requires

25:03.100 --> 25:04.692
tending, effort.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.823
Naturally, you've
opened yourself up

25:06.870 --> 25:08.690
to other opportunities.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.560
Much like a female
baboon broadcasts

25:10.610 --> 25:11.907
her readiness with
inflated genitals.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.532
You, Watson,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.172
are something of a
romantic terrorist.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.075
(scoffs)

25:17.110 --> 25:18.771
"Romantic terrorist."

25:18.810 --> 25:19.947
Your upbringing
pushes you towards

25:19.980 --> 25:21.777
a conventional relationship.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.084
But your eccentric
nature is repulsed

25:24.120 --> 25:26.008
by the reality of
such arrangements.

25:26.050 --> 25:28.587
That's why you find yourself
drawn to unsuitable partners.

25:28.620 --> 25:29.757
People like my brother.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.781
Of course, chance
will occasionally

25:31.830 --> 25:33.752
see to it that you do find
an appropriate match.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.795
It's connected to the
conflict at your core.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.730
The tension_ between
a conventional life

25:41.770 --> 25:44.034
and yearning to heed
the call of adventure.

25:44.070 --> 25:46.959
Okay, I do not yearn to head
the call of adventure.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.807
The only thing
I yearn to do right now

25:48.840 --> 25:49.829
is to get some work done.

25:51.180 --> 25:52.647
Well, Kitty should
be done tidying up

25:52.680 --> 25:53.942
the scene
of her staged murder very soon.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.572
Between the two of you,
we should be

25:55.620 --> 25:56.746
through these stacks
in no time.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.680
Where are you going?

25:58.720 --> 26:01.814
This mural-- not only is it
ugly, it's incongruous.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.589
And I shall not be able
to volunteer effectively

26:03.630 --> 26:05.757
until I know how it came
to be hanging here.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.897
Those six stand out.

26:12.930 --> 26:14.966
You may cease your drudgery.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.707
That mural,
I knew it was significant

26:17.740 --> 26:19.799
the moment I laid eyes
on its grotesque majesty.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.876
I called the director
of the program,

26:21.910 --> 26:23.309
and I asked him all about it.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.171
It is called
The Magical Myristica Tour.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.713
And it was painted by one
of Spaulding's former students.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.877
Magical Myristica Tour?

26:29.920 --> 26:31.785
It's primarily a witless pun.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.152
But it also references
the Myristica tree.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.987
A tree which is known
for producing two spices.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.009
The first is mace.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.029
The second... is nutmeg.

26:40.060 --> 26:43.359
So, one of their old students
had a thing for nutmeg.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.992
His name is Conrad Woodbine,
and he's painted

26:45.030 --> 26:46.725
an entire series of paintings,

26:46.770 --> 26:48.897
which detail
the hallucinogenic effects

26:48.940 --> 26:51.067
of ingesting large quantities
of the spice.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.704
You can get high off nutmeg?

26:53.740 --> 26:56.106
I can't say it's a particularly
satisfying experience, but yeah.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.698
Conrad Woodbine

26:57.750 --> 26:59.342
has subcontracted
to the city

26:59.380 --> 27:01.871
as a crime scene cleaner
for a decade.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.808
Until five years ago
when he quit

27:03.850 --> 27:05.818
and purchased a building
full of art studios

27:05.850 --> 27:07.078
on Spring Street.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.088
Now, how does
an ex-crime scene cleaner

27:09.120 --> 27:11.429
afford real estate in SoHo?

27:11.460 --> 27:14.691
Perhaps he hasn't quit
the trade after all.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.197
Mr. Woodbine?

27:16.230 --> 27:18.425
I'm not to be disturbed
while I'm working.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.267
This building doesn't
need a superintendent

27:20.300 --> 27:21.790
who can't superintend.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.933
I know, but...

27:23.970 --> 27:25.665
they're police.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.782
You three are cops?

27:37.820 --> 27:39.685
To varying degrees.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.314
We'd like to speak with
you about your other job.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.727
The one which requires
some actual artistry.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.125
What are you talking about?

27:47.160 --> 27:49.697
You dissolve
corpses for money.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.868
I'm calling my lawyer.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.004
Why did you just come out
and accuse him like that?

28:00.040 --> 28:01.871
Now he's never gonna talk.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.229
I wanted him
to step away.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.805
I'm curious what's
in that cabinet.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.818
None of the others are locked.

28:07.850 --> 28:10.011
That one is.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.281
(lock clicking)

28:24.870 --> 28:27.168
Smells like pumpkin pie.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.065
WOODBINE:
My lawyer says
you have to leave.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.499
HOLMES:
Actually, you can have
your attorney

28:30.540 --> 28:32.508
meet us at the police station.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.428
We found your nutmeg concoction.

28:40.180 --> 28:43.741
I'm not answering any questions
till my lawyer gets here.

28:43.790 --> 28:47.044
But I will tell you
that supply cabinet was locked.

28:47.090 --> 28:48.853
Our consultant said it was open.

28:48.890 --> 28:50.255
Well, your consultant's lying.

28:50.290 --> 28:53.179
In 1997, you graduated
from Spaulding

28:53.230 --> 28:55.391
Technical Institute,
you started your career

28:55.430 --> 28:56.419
as a crime scene Cleaner.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.064
And over the next 11 years,

28:58.100 --> 29:01.297
you took on dozens of cases
for the city.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.002
You were liked,
you were in demand.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.463
A lot of guys like that would've
taken on more employees,

29:06.510 --> 29:08.307
maybe even franchised.

29:08.340 --> 29:10.001
What did you do?

29:10.040 --> 29:11.371
You retired.

29:11.410 --> 29:12.502
Took up painting.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.313
Is this interrogation
bothering you?

29:14.350 --> 29:15.840
WOODBINE:
Presumably you've been to your

29:15.880 --> 29:17.313
fair share of crime scenes.

29:17.350 --> 29:20.183
You know how difficult it is
to see what we see.

29:20.220 --> 29:23.826
The blood, the viscera,
the heartbreak.

29:23.860 --> 29:26.454
We know you didn't quit the
clean-up business, Mr. Woodbine.

29:26.490 --> 29:28.458
You just switched sides.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.388
You started working
for the criminals

29:30.430 --> 29:32.193
instead of the cops.

29:32.230 --> 29:36.166
And you helped disappear
all of these people.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.009
The bad guys pay more.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.507
We get that.

29:39.540 --> 29:40.529
That's why we're not
looking at you

29:40.570 --> 29:42.834
for any of the murders...
for now.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.575
But you give us the
names of the individuals

29:44.610 --> 29:46.407
who did kill these people,

29:46.450 --> 29:48.338
we'll recommend
a deal to the DA.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.883
I've broken no laws.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.888
You have no proof
of any wrongdoing.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.353
Just some claims
that some potential

29:54.390 --> 29:56.449
crime scenes smelled
like nutmeg.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.355
My mother keeps nutmeg
in her spice rack.

29:58.390 --> 30:00.483
Maybe you want to
question her, too.

30:00.530 --> 30:03.249
Well, so much for getting him
to cooperate.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.393
Disappointing but
not surprising.

30:05.430 --> 30:09.366
Fortunately there are
other ways to undo him.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.960
Conrad Woodbine is our cleaner.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.102
Of that we have no doubt.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.232
Problem is, of course,

30:14.280 --> 30:15.907
he's a cleaner.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.101
His MD. is based on leaving
no evidence behind.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.378
Right. But you said
that there was

30:19.410 --> 30:20.547
another way to get him.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.377
I submit that his undoing lies

30:22.420 --> 30:24.115
not in the physical evidence,

30:24.150 --> 30:25.617
but in the necessary evil
of every business

30:25.650 --> 30:27.379
in the service industry.

30:27.420 --> 30:28.387
Customers.

30:28.420 --> 30:29.455
He wouldn't give them up.

30:29.490 --> 30:31.424
But they might give him up.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.553
We figure out who wanted
each of these people dead

30:33.590 --> 30:34.921
and then we offer them

30:34.960 --> 30:37.520
the same kind of deal
that he turned down.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.494
Well, the only
person we know has

30:39.530 --> 30:41.259
_a connection with him
is Raymond Carpenter.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.631
In point of fact,
the connection lies

30:42.670 --> 30:45.230
between Carpenter's hired hand
and Woodbine.

30:45.270 --> 30:46.407
You're talking
about the man

30:46.440 --> 30:47.509
who killed Jessica Holder.

30:47.540 --> 30:48.905
But he's been dead for years.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.498
Well, lucky for us,
though unluclq

30:50.540 --> 30:52.269
for the disappeared,
Mr. Woodbine's career

30:52.310 --> 30:53.572
was prolific.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.111
So, while he was
being interrogated

30:55.150 --> 30:56.913
this afternoon,
I began at where I believe

30:56.950 --> 30:59.441
to be the beginning.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.310
Six years ago,

31:01.360 --> 31:03.055
Conrad Woodbine retired
from cleaning.

31:03.090 --> 31:04.455
At least, officially.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.253
At the same time, a group
of Armenian criminals

31:06.290 --> 31:08.053
arrived in New York.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.556
They looked to establish
themselves in Howard Beach.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.524
Much to the chagrin
of the Costa Rican gang

31:12.570 --> 31:13.662
that already resided there.

31:13.700 --> 31:16.168
War ensued.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.565
But months later,
the brain trust

31:17.600 --> 31:18.567
of that Costa Rican faction just

31:18.610 --> 31:20.407
disappeared.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.577
You think the Armenians
killed them

31:21.610 --> 31:23.407
and Woodbine cleaned them.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.668
There was never any word

31:24.710 --> 31:26.246
of what happened, only rumor.

31:26.280 --> 31:27.542
They'd been slaughtered
in the backroom

31:27.580 --> 31:28.945
of a restaurant they frequented.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.948
A detective who went there

31:30.990 --> 31:32.685
reported an unusual smell.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.483
Like something from a bakery.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.556
Now, Artem
Dedekian

31:37.590 --> 31:39.057
was the Armenian
group's leader

31:39.090 --> 31:40.557
at the time.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.399
I think he's worth
talking to, don't you?

31:42.430 --> 31:43.658
(phone chimes)

31:46.430 --> 31:48.637
Is our investigation
bothering you?

31:48.670 --> 31:50.228
No.

31:50.270 --> 31:53.535
Tomorrow, we will speak
with Mr. Dedekian.

31:53.570 --> 31:54.707
You will continue
to pour over the cases

31:54.740 --> 31:56.503
of the disappeared.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.974
In case he is not in a helpful
mood, we will need backups.

31:59.010 --> 32:01.046
Let me know when you have a time
and a place for the meet.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.638
I have something
I have to take care of.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.651
(footsteps approaching)

32:15.160 --> 32:18.527
So, that's Dedekian?

32:18.570 --> 32:19.594
He looks hale.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.166
Retirement
swts him.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.634
Captain Gregson is just
finishing something up

32:23.670 --> 32:25.001
and then, uh,
we'll begin.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.268
(clears throat)

32:28.010 --> 32:30.376
I'm not a
terrorist.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.241
I shut Chris down last night

32:32.280 --> 32:35.647
and I'm preparing a welcome home
dinner for Andrew tomorrow.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.545
I mean, maybe I do
hear the call of...

32:37.580 --> 32:39.241
adventure, or whatever you said,

32:39.290 --> 32:40.689
but I can do that
and have a life.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.553
Perhaps.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.319
You do realize
I wasn't critICIzmg you

32:45.360 --> 32:46.725
yesterday?

32:46.760 --> 32:48.728
You compared me to a baboon
with inflated genitals

32:48.760 --> 32:50.523
and then you called me
a terrorist.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.199
I was using vivid imagery
to illustrate a point.

32:53.230 --> 32:54.697
It was an attempt to be helpful.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.192
Your romantic inclinations

32:57.240 --> 32:58.559
are not a flaw to be corrected;

32:58.610 --> 33:00.532
they're a trait to be accepted.

33:00.570 --> 33:02.504
I know you,
Watson.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.246
I know you'll never be happy

33:04.280 --> 33:06.544
within the confines of
a "traditional relationship"

33:06.580 --> 33:08.639
and I said_ what I said
because it pains me

33:08.680 --> 33:10.773
to see you try to fit into one
simply because

33:10.820 --> 33:13.311
it is the default mode
of polite society.

33:13.350 --> 33:15.284
Well, there is no reason
to feel pain,

33:15.320 --> 33:16.719
because I'm happy with Andrew.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.728
Or would you be happier
without him?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.728
Alternatively, with him as

33:20.760 --> 33:22.421
an occasional sex partner
and confidant?

33:22.460 --> 33:24.269
Or with him when
he's in the States

33:24.300 --> 33:26.621
and free to pursue other
interests when he's not?

33:26.670 --> 33:28.433
There are any number
of possible arrangements.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.165
All you need to do

33:30.200 --> 33:31.599
is find one which is
true to your nature.

33:33.810 --> 33:35.368
It really is quite
remarkable to me.

33:35.410 --> 33:36.672
All this time
we've spent together,

33:36.710 --> 33:38.302
and you remain a far more
interesting person

33:38.350 --> 33:39.703
than you give yourself
credit for.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.673
(whistles)

33:48.260 --> 33:50.683
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Dedekian.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.585
I understand you have questions

33:52.630 --> 33:55.554
about someone named
Conrad Woodbine?

33:55.600 --> 33:57.556
I don't know
the name.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.828
The name might escape you,

33:58.870 --> 34:00.622
but the work must have
left an impre55ion.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.069
WATSON:
It was SIX years ago.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.761
He helped turn
a few Costa Rican gangsters

34:03.800 --> 34:05.131
into soup for you.

34:05.170 --> 34:07.365
Sorry.

34:07.410 --> 34:08.672
Don't know what
you're talking about.

34:08.710 --> 34:10.473
HOLMES:
You're quite
a unique case

34:10.510 --> 34:12.102
in the criminal
underworld, aren't you?

34:12.150 --> 34:15.210
A one-time kingpin
who's managed to extract himself

34:15.250 --> 34:17.377
entirely from his past

34:17.420 --> 34:18.785
_andlead
a qUIeter eXIstence.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.084
You were just one
of Woodbine's clients.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.781
There were others, many others,
and we've set to work

34:22.820 --> 34:25.425
identifying them
so we might offer a deal.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.155
GREGSON:
Tell us how you found

34:27.190 --> 34:29.397
Woodbine, and what
he did for you,

34:29.430 --> 34:31.625
and I'm gonna
help you work out

34:31.670 --> 34:33.558
an immunity agreement
with the DA's office.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.737
HOLMES:
One of Woodbine's customers

34:34.770 --> 34:36.738
is gonna be a very
luclq person indeed.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.431
Why?

34:38.470 --> 34:40.631
_ Because he_or she
Will get away With murder.

34:40.670 --> 34:41.705
Perhaps even murders.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.731
Why?
Because we desire

34:43.780 --> 34:45.645
Woodbine above all others.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.773
Why?
Because he can, in turn,

34:47.810 --> 34:50.574
give us the names
of dozens of killers.

34:50.620 --> 34:51.712
Including yours.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.638
WATSON:
Someone's gonna
talk to us,

34:53.690 --> 34:55.157
Mr. Dedekian.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.452
It may as well be you.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.785
Conrad Woodbine!

35:00.830 --> 35:03.298
Police!

35:04.770 --> 35:06.590
Clear!

35:06.630 --> 35:07.722
Clear.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.533
Clear!
It's all clear.

35:09.570 --> 35:11.765
(indistinct radio chatter)

35:14.740 --> 35:16.207
Do you
smell that?

35:17.880 --> 35:20.201
Nutmeg.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.514
He keeps his concoction
hidden and sealed.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.812
There's really
no reason

35:23.850 --> 35:26.717
that the aroma should
overpower the room.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.859
Unless...

35:34.450 --> 35:39.670
(sniffing)

35:39.670 --> 35:40.728
(sniffs)

35:53.780 --> 35:55.714
Did you notice

35:55.750 --> 35:56.944
how Conrad Woodbine walked
with a limp yesterday?

35:56.980 --> 35:58.811
Yes.

35:58.850 --> 36:01.250
I think he might have had
knee surgery recently.

36:01.290 --> 36:02.552
And why do
you say that?

36:02.590 --> 36:04.387
'Cause I've just found his

36:04.430 --> 36:05.920
artificial patella tendon

36:05.960 --> 36:08.827
in the
grease trap.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.828
I don't think we're going
to be hearing from Mr. Woodbine

36:10.860 --> 36:12.828
any time soon.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.895
Our cleaner's been cleaned.

36:21.410 --> 36:22.570
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:22.610 --> 36:24.498
Well, the ME. just confirmed
that the piece of plastic

36:24.550 --> 36:26.404
you found is
an artificial tendon.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.714
It's got Kevlar in it.
That's why it didn't melt.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.877
She didn't know if there's
any usable DNA on it.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.512
As for the rest
of the scene,

36:32.550 --> 36:35.485
whoever took care of Woodbine
left the place spotless.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.249
Seems like the killer's
just as good

36:37.290 --> 36:38.325
at cleaning up a mess
as Woodbine was.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.351
HOLMES:
It doesn't make any sense.

36:40.390 --> 36:42.449
Woodbine was the cleaner.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.694
This was his livelihood.

36:43.730 --> 36:44.992
He wouldn't broadcast
his methods.

36:45.030 --> 36:47.294
He'd_ make himself
irrelevant.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.389
Maybe he had a partner.
BELL:
Let's hope so.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.499
'Cause it sure looks
like Woodbine's gone.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.508
And whatever he knew
about all those murders

36:53.540 --> 36:55.929
went down the drain
with him.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.918
KITTY:
Maybe that man Artem
Dedekian killed Woodbine.

37:03.950 --> 37:05.440
He could have changed his mind

37:05.490 --> 37:06.343
about the deal
that you offered him.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.381
Watson and I went straight

37:08.420 --> 37:10.388
from interviewing Dedekian
to Conrad Woodbine's studio.

37:10.420 --> 37:12.024
That's hardly enough time
for him to arrange a murder

37:12.060 --> 37:15.029
and meticulous cleansing
of the scene.

37:15.060 --> 37:16.596
Why am I doing this?

37:16.630 --> 37:18.598
Disassemble the crime board.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.518
I don't
understand.

37:20.570 --> 37:21.798
You're just...
giving up.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.330
Maybe we can find
someone else

37:23.370 --> 37:24.667
who hired Woodbine.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.405
Without a living cleaner,

37:26.440 --> 37:27.634
we have no leverage
to make a deal

37:27.670 --> 37:29.501
_ with one of
his former employers.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.529
And I'm not "giving up."

37:30.580 --> 37:31.808
I'm retrenching.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.044
A clean environment

37:33.080 --> 37:35.514
stimulates
fresh lines of thought.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.458
It's Raymond Carpenter,
the guy who told you

37:56.500 --> 37:58.559
he ordered Jessica
Holder's murder.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.430
That's the day he was convicted
of 18 different felonies.

38:00.470 --> 38:01.732
Friends and family with him.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.475
They all look like
they took it pretty hard.

38:04.510 --> 38:05.408
So...?

38:05.450 --> 38:09.614
So, we've seen him before.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.714
HOLMES:
That's the superintendant

38:13.750 --> 38:15.581
of Conrad Woodbine's building.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.748
What's he doing at
Raymond Carpenter's trial?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.329
Scan this.
E-mail it to Watson.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.965
Tell her we've got work to do.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.991
(door buzzes)

38:37.110 --> 38:39.078
Jessica Holder
may have been killed

38:39.110 --> 38:40.748
by one of your paid assassins,

38:40.780 --> 38:43.749
but her body was disposed of
by Conrad Woodbine.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.487
If you say so.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.408
You, Mr. Carpenter,
have three sons.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.519
Now, your two oldest offspring,

38:50.560 --> 38:52.528
they've taken after you
and already begun to flourish

38:52.560 --> 38:54.027
in their own fledgling
criminal ventures--

38:54.060 --> 38:55.948
helped along, of course,
by your incarcerated hand.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.797
But your youngest son,
though, Jeremy...

38:57.830 --> 39:00.424
he's a different story.

39:00.470 --> 39:01.789
Flunked out of
several schools.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.467
Fired from every job

39:03.500 --> 39:05.365
you've managed to land for him.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.935
With all due respect--
a wastrel.

39:07.970 --> 39:11.474
Now, what's a father to do
with a boy like that?

39:11.510 --> 39:13.046
Send him to trade school,
of course.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.514
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.745
You apprenticed him
to Conrad Woodbine.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.884
It was a convenient arrangement.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.480
Jeremy would earn a livelihood,

39:22.520 --> 39:23.953
and Mr. Woodbine was
only too happy, I'm sure,

39:23.990 --> 39:25.423
to accommodate one of his most

39:25.460 --> 39:27.121
valued
clients.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.128
Jeremy even served
as his superintendant

39:29.160 --> 39:30.559
while the two of them waited

39:30.600 --> 39:32.420
for murder victims to dissolve.

39:32.470 --> 39:33.596
WATSON:
Of course, when we
went to see Woodbine

39:33.630 --> 39:35.791
at his studio and
ask him questions,

39:35.840 --> 39:37.432
Jeremy
told you.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.802
And you couldn't
have that, could you?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.536
Woodbine knew all
your secrets, your
family's secrets.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.468
I mean, God knows
what would happen

39:44.510 --> 39:46.068
if he told the
police everything

39:46.110 --> 39:47.577
that you had
hired him to do.

39:47.610 --> 39:49.475
So you had Woodbine
taken care of.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.887
Jeremy killed him and then
cleaned up after himself.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.059
It must be said,
he did a rather good job.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.615
You finally found him
work he's taken to.

39:57.660 --> 39:58.888
I suppose
congratulations are due.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.750
Do you really expect me to admit
to any of this nonsense?

40:03.800 --> 40:05.665
We're done.

40:05.700 --> 40:06.962
It's true things can't
get any worse for you.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.467
But for Jeremy...

40:08.500 --> 40:10.832
He must know some
very damning secrets

40:10.870 --> 40:12.667
about some very
dangerous people.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.166
We know some of the names

40:14.210 --> 40:15.677
of the people
who hired Woodbine.

40:15.710 --> 40:17.507
We'll get more.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.475
How do you think
they'll react when
they find out

40:20.510 --> 40:21.943
that your son was his apprentice

40:21.980 --> 40:24.073
and that police are
pressing him to make a deal?

40:24.120 --> 40:26.918
If you care for your son,
call him.

40:26.950 --> 40:28.611
If he issues
a confe55ion

40:28.660 --> 40:29.911
and agrees to testify

40:29.960 --> 40:31.689
against the people
who hired him,

40:31.730 --> 40:33.618
we'll see he's assigned
to the safe environs

40:33.660 --> 40:34.649
of a white collar prison.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.793
If not,

40:36.830 --> 40:39.765
he's about to make _
some very potent enemies.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.631
People who will find him

40:41.670 --> 40:42.864
wherever he hides.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.709
(aggressive punk music
playing loudly)

40:55.180 --> 40:57.671
(music gets quieter)

40:57.720 --> 40:59.119
Too loud?

40:59.150 --> 41:01.141
I'm not here
about the music.

41:04.260 --> 41:06.558
REPORTER:
Authorities were stunned today

41:06.590 --> 41:08.558
when 20-year-old
Jeremy Carpenter

41:08.600 --> 41:10.591
confessed to killing
Conrad Woodbine,

41:10.630 --> 41:13.098
a man Carpenter says
trained him to clean up

41:13.130 --> 41:14.734
after murders.
It's believed that...

41:14.770 --> 41:16.567
(news report shuts off)

41:16.600 --> 41:18.659
Your insights made
that arrest possible.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.109
You are
progressmg.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.607
A pleasure
to watch.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.702
Normally, I ask you
to keep your music

41:24.750 --> 41:26.604
at a reasonable level
during my reading hours,

41:26.650 --> 41:28.618
but tonight feel
free to enjoy it

41:28.650 --> 41:30.174
at whatever
volume you Wish.

41:40.790 --> 41:44.089
(music gets louder)

41:45.630 --> 41:47.621
(music shuts off)

41:58.180 --> 42:00.171
*

42:08.960 --> 42:10.916
(exhales)

42:10.960 --> 42:12.951
