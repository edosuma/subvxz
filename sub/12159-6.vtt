[ SIGHS ] FINALLY.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.664

BUT AT LEAST YOU END UP
WITH A CLEAN OLD LADY, HUH?

00:35.503 --> 00:38.003

STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.

APPARENTLY, AFTER A LONG DAY
OF HUNTING AND FISHING,

IS SIX SWEATY GUYS IN ONE TENT.

ONE AT A TIME.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.592
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.
YEAH.

ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS SELL ONE A DAY FOR TWO YEARS,
