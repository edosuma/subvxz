In the beginning,

00:51.495 --> 00:54.330
there was blood.

00:54.414 --> 00:57.750
The land demands it.

00:57.817 --> 01:01.337
Every new land demands blood,

01:01.421 --> 01:04.340
and we relent.

01:04.424 --> 01:07.793
It is our nature.

01:19.890 --> 01:23.025
We are, after all, animals.

01:23.110 --> 01:26.312
In our arrogance,
we forget this,

01:26.363 --> 01:28.364
but... In the end,

01:28.448 --> 01:32.118
we rise from the land,

01:32.185 --> 01:35.571
only to return.

01:40.043 --> 01:42.995
You're very skilled
with a blade.

01:43.046 --> 01:45.381
Mr. Bauer.

01:45.465 --> 01:49.001
Very efficient.

01:49.052 --> 01:52.304
There's no pride in
wastefulness, herr Swede.

01:52.372 --> 01:55.891
Only sin.
We must use all.

01:55.976 --> 01:58.894
Even this.

02:00.063 --> 02:02.548
Mm. Jah. Hmm!

02:03.934 --> 02:07.653
A good butcher
does not waste lives.

02:12.892 --> 02:16.579
It's a shame, what
happened to your friend,

02:16.663 --> 02:20.833
dieter schmidt.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.451
It is not fair.

02:23.837 --> 02:26.255
We come here for better lives.

02:26.339 --> 02:28.424
We work hard.

02:28.508 --> 02:31.010
And his life is
taken for no reason,

02:31.077 --> 02:32.928
just some filthy whore.

02:33.013 --> 02:34.913
Yeah, I agree.

02:34.965 --> 02:37.433
A useless end.

02:37.517 --> 02:42.188
A needless, sinful squandering
of a productive life.

02:43.190 --> 02:45.641
Yeah.

02:54.951 --> 02:58.070
Nothing wasted
in this wasteland.

02:58.121 --> 03:00.489
Nothing.

Our foreman's been killed.

04:52.558 --> 04:56.478
I saw him out in front of the whorehouse.
He didn't look too good.

04:58.848 --> 05:02.517
Ahem. You'll have to
ride out to rail's end.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.237
The men are waiting for orders.

05:05.321 --> 05:08.390
Yes, ma'am.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.617
Mr. Bohannon, you may
have heard that--

05:18.701 --> 05:21.169
You're working for durant now?

05:21.237 --> 05:22.754
For the railroad, yes.

05:25.741 --> 05:30.429
He's been very kind to me.

05:30.513 --> 05:32.764
Actually respects my opinion.

05:32.849 --> 05:35.217
Sounds good.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.352
Yes, well...

05:37.420 --> 05:39.921
You know
how people talk--

05:39.973 --> 05:42.274
To hell with people.

05:44.060 --> 05:48.596
I'm glad for you, Lily.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.783
Thank you.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.374
Good day,
Mr. Bohannon.

06:17.093 --> 06:19.845
You told me you weren't much
of a drinking man.

06:19.929 --> 06:22.314
Seems to me like
you've taken to the bottle

06:22.398 --> 06:24.733
like a babe to the breast.

06:27.070 --> 06:29.271
What is it?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.523
A woman?

06:33.743 --> 06:36.578
I thought so.

06:36.645 --> 06:39.915
Ahh.

06:39.982 --> 06:43.168
I have another
assignment for you,

06:43.252 --> 06:45.820
Mr. ferguson.

06:45.872 --> 06:50.375
I would like you to keep
an eye on Mr. Bohannon.

06:53.429 --> 06:56.214
This about a woman,
Mr. durant?

06:57.683 --> 07:00.635
I took a risk
bringing him here,

07:00.686 --> 07:04.940
and I just want to make sure that
risk does not backfire on me.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.842
Now, can you put your
friendship with him aside

07:07.894 --> 07:09.945
and do that for me?

07:10.012 --> 07:13.565
Yes, sir.
I can do this job.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.538
Good.

07:20.907 --> 07:24.526
I could have did his job, too.

07:34.137 --> 07:36.505
Sweet Jesus.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.042
Mmm. Mmm. Ooh.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.844
Are you all right?

07:42.895 --> 07:45.230
Bloody gobsmacked...

07:45.314 --> 07:46.681
Is what I am.

07:46.732 --> 07:49.017
You're a miracle, you are

07:49.068 --> 07:50.718
although me langer

07:50.770 --> 07:52.354
is chafed something fierce.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.239
Ohh!

07:58.327 --> 08:00.328
Hey, where are you off to?

08:00.396 --> 08:02.781
I've got customers waiting.

08:02.865 --> 08:05.500
What's wrong?

08:06.702 --> 08:08.570
I'm scared, Mickey.

08:08.621 --> 08:13.008
That business with penny
has all the girls spooked.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.460
Come here to me.

08:18.965 --> 08:22.384
You and the other girls

08:22.435 --> 08:24.919
needn't worry no more.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.355
Sean and me are running
protection on this place now.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.275
Any one of them brutes so
much as lays a finger on you,

08:30.359 --> 08:32.110
you come to ol' Mick,

08:32.195 --> 08:35.614
and he'll get done
like schmidt.

08:35.698 --> 08:37.899
Mick...

08:37.950 --> 08:40.034
You done schmidt?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.203
Um...

08:42.270 --> 08:44.956
What did you think?

09:14.987 --> 09:17.489
What'd you spend it on?

09:17.573 --> 09:20.492
We got a problem here, psalms?

09:20.576 --> 09:22.494
Working under the man
that stole our money.

09:22.578 --> 09:25.914
Bet your ass I got a problem.

09:25.981 --> 09:28.116
The payroll was insured by the
United States government.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.168
You got your money.
Late.

09:30.253 --> 09:32.003
I got it late.

09:32.088 --> 09:35.123
When you're living payroll to
payroll, that mean you go hungry.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.828
Look here...

09:41.847 --> 09:44.683
It wasn't personal, all right?

09:44.767 --> 09:47.469
You stole my money.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.972
I take that shit personal.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.808
This man's right.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.444
I stoled y'all's payroll.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.030
And Mr. durant
saved my hide

09:59.115 --> 10:00.448
from hanging
so I could ride out here

10:00.516 --> 10:02.217
and whip your sorry
asses into shape.

10:02.285 --> 10:03.985
It ain't fair, but there it is.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.241
Anybody else got
a problem with that?

10:12.295 --> 10:14.713
Mr. Toole? You got
a problem with me?

10:14.797 --> 10:16.831
I haven't, sure.

10:16.882 --> 10:20.969
Wasn't my payroll you took.

10:21.036 --> 10:24.756
Gentlemen, meet
your new foreman.

10:36.902 --> 10:40.888
Did you do it?

10:42.325 --> 10:44.693
Do what?

10:44.744 --> 10:48.029
Elam ferguson,
you tell me plain.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.583
You the fool gutted
that whore-killer?

10:51.667 --> 10:53.868
Who you calling "fool"?

10:53.919 --> 10:55.837
Oh, damn.

10:55.904 --> 10:58.906
You did do it.

11:02.178 --> 11:04.262
No one's ever...

11:04.347 --> 11:07.799
Gutted a man for me before.

11:07.883 --> 11:10.719
I ain't never said
I did such a thing.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.972
Well, it sure as hell
wasn't Mr. Toole that did it.

11:18.194 --> 11:20.395
You sure about that?

11:20.446 --> 11:23.231
He tried to hang a man once.
I remember.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.900
Mr. Toole's my husband,

11:25.951 --> 11:29.287
and I got no complaints.

11:29.372 --> 11:32.940
He's put food in my belly
and a roof over my head

11:32.992 --> 11:34.626
ever since we hopped the twig.

11:34.710 --> 11:37.612
And he never raised
a hand to me but twice,

11:37.663 --> 11:39.748
and both times,
he had liquor on him,

11:39.799 --> 11:43.385
and he done it all
with charitable words

11:43.452 --> 11:46.471
and a lovesick smile.

11:46.555 --> 11:48.223
Charitable words
while he beating on you?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.974
Truth be told,

11:50.059 --> 11:52.060
I probably deserved it.

11:52.127 --> 11:54.962
He better hope I never see
him raise a hand to you.

12:08.411 --> 12:11.112
You are a fool.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.448
You're a fool that
would rather have a...

12:13.499 --> 12:17.151
Pocket full of gold eagles
than a strong backed,

12:17.203 --> 12:19.504
sweet-mouthed woman
willing to...

12:19.588 --> 12:22.490
Wash your drawers
and warm your bed,

12:22.541 --> 12:26.094
and all for nothing
but a kiss...

12:26.161 --> 12:29.431
And a promise.

12:36.439 --> 12:38.556
Stop that.

12:38.641 --> 12:40.692
I'm married!

12:40.776 --> 12:44.512
I just came to thank you
for what you did.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.545
Whoa.

13:00.629 --> 13:05.533
Another wretched soul for you
to commend to heaven, Reverend.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.385
Ahh.

13:09.805 --> 13:14.309
I don't remember seeing you
at the pulpit of late.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.478
Come to think of it, I...

13:16.545 --> 13:19.647
Can't recall you
preaching at all

13:19.715 --> 13:22.984
since we arrived
here at our new home.

13:23.051 --> 13:25.386
Yeah, well, I have
nothing to say.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.689
No one wants to hear.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.192
You know, they've
taken away my church.

13:31.243 --> 13:34.061
A den of thieves.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.414
They've also taken my caboose.

13:36.499 --> 13:38.666
You know, my very own
daughter took it from me.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.368
And I believe she's--

13:40.419 --> 13:43.705
She's trying to corrupt my son.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.624
Shame.

13:49.578 --> 13:54.516
Our lord rode into Jerusalem
on the back of an ass.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.752
And one of the first thing
he done when got there

13:57.803 --> 14:02.273
was cleanse the temple.

14:02.358 --> 14:06.694
Herd the money lenders out
on their avaricious rumps.

14:06.762 --> 14:10.532
It's time we overturn
the tables, Reverend.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.119
We must cast them out.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.619
If we can cross this,

14:31.670 --> 14:35.557
we have a clear path to
the Colorado territory.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.842
If we fail,

14:37.927 --> 14:39.978
or if we're delayed,

14:40.062 --> 14:43.097
I lose my race
with the central pacific

14:43.165 --> 14:46.868
and this railroad is a failure.

14:46.936 --> 14:48.653
Men don't want me here.

14:48.737 --> 14:51.072
They won't work hard.

14:51.139 --> 14:53.641
Then make them!
It ain't that easy.

14:55.578 --> 14:58.312
I bought your life back.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.781
And you made a bad purchase.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.983
That's my business.

15:02.034 --> 15:05.286
Yours is to get me
to the rockies.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.038
Sooner you do that,

15:07.122 --> 15:09.207
sooner you'll be free.

15:19.436 --> 15:21.053
We are not here to cast stones

15:21.104 --> 15:24.589
or talk about the circumstances
of Mr. Schmidt's death.

15:24.641 --> 15:28.760
The time for judgment
is not now.

15:28.812 --> 15:30.762
This is a time to reflect.

15:30.814 --> 15:33.532
Look around.

15:33.599 --> 15:38.287
This is the world
that Mr. schmidt built.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.439
You.

15:40.490 --> 15:43.575
These friendships.

15:43.627 --> 15:45.610
Just as all of you
have joined him

15:45.662 --> 15:49.048
in the building
of this railroad.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.467
After all...

15:51.551 --> 15:53.552
Was Jesus not a carpenter?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.971
A builder?

15:56.056 --> 15:59.475
For this, we are all blessed.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.060
Fornicator!

16:02.979 --> 16:05.014
Reverend, please.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.401
Now this is not a time

16:09.469 --> 16:10.903
to cast judgment or speak
about the sins of the dead--

16:10.970 --> 16:12.771
I'm not speaking
about the dead.

16:12.822 --> 16:14.323
I'm speaking about you.

16:14.407 --> 16:18.277
She has lain with a man
from the camp,

16:18.328 --> 16:21.330
and the blood of her sin

16:21.414 --> 16:23.499
has stained our altar!

16:23.583 --> 16:24.783
How dare you come in here!

16:24.834 --> 16:27.586
You won't take my church.
Your church?!

16:27.653 --> 16:29.838
You gave this church up
for a bottle of whisky.

16:29.923 --> 16:32.257
Fornicator!
Reverend!

16:34.327 --> 16:35.327
Reverend!

16:35.378 --> 16:37.930
Show respect!
This is a funeral!

16:37.997 --> 16:40.466
Out, out!
Gentlemen!

16:40.517 --> 16:43.802
This man of God
is not your enemy.

16:43.853 --> 16:48.840
Everyone is upset.
We have all lost a brother.

16:48.892 --> 16:50.776
You, uh...

16:50.843 --> 16:52.844
Poor Mr. schmidt.

16:52.896 --> 16:56.615
You tr-- you traveled
from Germany together.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.951
Eh? Is it not true?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.036
Jah.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.622
How did your friend
brave those seas

17:03.689 --> 17:06.541
to be gutted and displayed
in the street,

17:06.626 --> 17:09.962
like a pig
in your butcher shop?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.030
He was a good man.

17:12.082 --> 17:13.665
Yeah, he was.

17:13.717 --> 17:17.219
And he was murdered
by whoremongers.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.037
Uh-huh.

17:19.089 --> 17:21.705
Now we all know the truth.

17:21.758 --> 17:24.226
Your anger is not
at Reverend Cole.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.978
Oh, no, no, no.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.481
It is at a world

17:29.549 --> 17:32.067
where your friend is dead
and, uh, Irish brothers

17:32.152 --> 17:34.686
who butchered him
are allowed to walk free

17:34.738 --> 17:38.440
and... Boast
of their crime.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.117
Where's McGinnes?

17:55.175 --> 17:59.261
Mr. McGinnes!
Mr. McGinnes!

17:59.345 --> 18:00.579
Mr. McGinnes!

18:00.630 --> 18:02.848
What is it?
They've got him!

18:02.915 --> 18:05.350
Mr. McGinnes.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.438
These men would like
a word with you.

18:16.362 --> 18:17.613
What-- what are you
doing? No, no!

18:17.697 --> 18:18.697
Good day.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.400
No!

18:21.451 --> 18:24.036
So, what's your opinion
on that gorge, Ms. Bell?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.238
She thinks we should avoid it.

18:26.289 --> 18:29.291
Thomas, please.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.578
I believe it to be
too dangerous.

18:32.629 --> 18:36.548
We've never built a bridge of
that size and scope before.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.951
And the sioux will harass
us every step of the way.

18:40.003 --> 18:43.288
And that's where I come
in, I suppose, huh?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.759
Thought you should know that you
got a mob of Germans out there

18:47.811 --> 18:51.463
dragging them McGinnes boys
into the slaughterhouse.

18:52.649 --> 18:55.901
I'll take the front,
you take the back.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.487
Ain't none of my business.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.138
That's your job.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.740
This...

19:01.807 --> 19:04.910
Is railroad business,
Mr. ferguson.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.658
Get this boy, will you?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.836
I didn't do anything,
please, please.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.858
Please tell me what's going on.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.609
Please, please!

19:37.677 --> 19:38.861
Get up!

19:42.682 --> 19:44.199
We didn't do anything!

19:51.291 --> 19:52.857
Now not to worry.
I don't know what this is about.

19:52.909 --> 19:54.826
If you want money,
we've got money.

19:54.878 --> 19:57.713
Money is no object
to us, all right?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.331
So just talk to us.

19:59.382 --> 20:01.866
I'll kill you!

20:04.804 --> 20:08.223
Where the hell you think
you're going?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.709
I'm taking the front.

20:27.243 --> 20:29.578
Mess them up.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.230
You don't have to do this.

20:32.282 --> 20:34.032
I know what you want!

20:34.083 --> 20:36.067
You don't have to do this.

20:36.119 --> 20:38.003
Shut them up.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.907
You don't have to shut--

20:51.083 --> 20:54.853
You need to let them boys down.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.891
Don't look at him.

20:59.943 --> 21:01.860
He ain't the one talking.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.530
This is not your
business, Schwartze.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.782
They killed our friend.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.617
Your friend killed a woman.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.603
You should not listen
to the talk of whores.

21:11.654 --> 21:15.207
Step back.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.076
Real easy.

21:18.127 --> 21:19.962
Who the hell are you?

21:21.547 --> 21:23.799
I've been gone that long?

21:23.883 --> 21:26.251
Mr. ferguson,
tell them who I am.

21:26.302 --> 21:27.803
Tell 'em yourself.

21:30.556 --> 21:33.458
I answer directly
to Thomas durant.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.627
We both do.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.815
There's only two of you.

22:11.381 --> 22:14.883
No, no.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.019
We didn't do it,
Mr. Bohannon!

22:17.103 --> 22:19.438
You know me!

22:19.505 --> 22:21.440
Did you take credit for it?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.942
Well, yeah.
But I was just running me mouth.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.610
You run your mouth,

22:25.678 --> 22:26.678
you take the consequences.

22:26.729 --> 22:29.281
They all think you did it.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.200
So congratulations,
dumbass. Get in there.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.893
I told your black friend.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.745
I will tell you.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.481
Either you kill these men
or I will.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.682
You hear that, Irish?!

23:03.733 --> 23:05.734
Either way,
you're going to die.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.437
All right, the whole
damn town heard you.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.741
You proved you're a man.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.944
Get your ass on out of here
before I show them otherwise.

23:39.776 --> 23:40.993
Why the long face?

23:41.060 --> 23:43.362
Your father's right.

23:43.413 --> 23:45.164
We are fornicators.

23:45.231 --> 23:47.666
Please, Joseph!

23:47.733 --> 23:51.837
We preach against sin, but in
God's eyes, we are sinners.

23:51.904 --> 23:53.756
This injun bothering you, miss?

23:53.840 --> 23:56.875
No. Thank you.

23:56.926 --> 23:57.909
Ruth!

23:57.961 --> 24:00.712
Ruth, I love you.

24:03.383 --> 24:05.584
I want to marry you.

24:10.690 --> 24:15.260
Joseph, think about
what you're saying.

24:15.311 --> 24:17.312
We will never be accepted
as man and wife.

24:17.397 --> 24:20.432
Then let's leave this place.

24:20.483 --> 24:22.434
Our church is here, Joseph.

24:22.485 --> 24:25.937
If I leave it with
father, it will die.

24:32.712 --> 24:36.248
You've got to get us
out of here.

24:36.299 --> 24:38.884
Sean.

24:43.473 --> 24:46.892
I'll write ma a proper
letter about your hanging.

24:46.959 --> 24:48.927
I won't mention the whores.

24:48.978 --> 24:50.896
My hanging?

24:50.963 --> 24:52.815
Wake up, brother,
they're hanging you, too.

24:52.899 --> 24:55.800
I never laid a hand on him!
Neither did I.

24:55.852 --> 24:58.821
Then why did you go around
blabbing to everyone that you had?

24:58.905 --> 25:01.073
I-- I was with my girl!

25:01.140 --> 25:03.308
Your girl.
You mean the whore.

25:03.359 --> 25:05.444
Watch your mouth.

25:05.495 --> 25:07.613
She's a whore, Mickey.

25:07.664 --> 25:11.166
By definition,
she screws men for money.

25:11.251 --> 25:13.418
And you want to impress her.

25:13.486 --> 25:15.671
Ginny believed it, and then
the other girls did, too,

25:15.755 --> 25:18.957
and-- I liked 'em
believing it.

25:19.008 --> 25:22.628
And you let me believe
it, too, wouldn't you?

25:22.679 --> 25:24.680
I wanted you to think
that I could do something

25:24.764 --> 25:28.016
on me own for once.

25:32.004 --> 25:35.724
Well, surely
Mr. Bohannon

25:35.808 --> 25:38.694
wouldn't let us hang.

25:41.847 --> 25:43.866
Will he?

25:46.018 --> 25:49.821
Even if, somehow,

25:49.873 --> 25:52.791
we slipped the noose,

25:52.858 --> 25:57.296
that Kraut bastard
will butcher us soon enough.

25:57.363 --> 25:59.798
Right?

26:04.304 --> 26:08.873
You and me both know Mickey
McgGinnes didn't de-bowel schmidt.

26:08.925 --> 26:11.059
He was just flapping his gums
to impress some girls.

26:11.144 --> 26:12.811
Well, he confessed.

26:12.878 --> 26:14.980
That's good enough for me.

26:15.047 --> 26:16.732
What about his brother?

26:16.816 --> 26:18.984
Well, they're obviously
in it together.

26:19.051 --> 26:22.187
So hang 'em both, huh?

26:22.238 --> 26:24.907
Well...

26:24.991 --> 26:27.442
Sean, uh,

26:27.527 --> 26:29.077
works for me.
He can be valuable.

26:29.162 --> 26:31.413
Perhaps we should spare him.

26:33.116 --> 26:35.400
But we cannot
be seen to be weak

26:35.451 --> 26:37.920
on the killing of a foreman.

26:38.004 --> 26:39.588
All right, then.

26:39.672 --> 26:41.506
Sunrise, we string 'em up.

26:41.574 --> 26:43.241
Perhaps we should
investigate further.

26:43.293 --> 26:46.428
What's to investigate?
He's a confessed killer,

26:46.512 --> 26:48.079
end of story.
He might be innocent.

26:48.131 --> 26:49.765
You know...

26:49.849 --> 26:54.937
I'm going to leave
you two to debate that.

27:01.027 --> 27:03.278
We have to stop
Mr. Bohannon

27:03.363 --> 27:05.197
from hanging Mickey McGinnes.

27:05.264 --> 27:08.450
We ain't got
to do nothin' about it.

27:09.935 --> 27:13.121
The man is innocent.

27:13.206 --> 27:15.273
So what?

27:15.325 --> 27:17.492
They hang, we scot free.

27:18.795 --> 27:21.463
I'm going to tell Mr
. durant what we've done.

27:21.547 --> 27:23.048
Hold on now.

27:23.115 --> 27:25.550
You confess, you'll be
watching me hang instead of him.

27:25.618 --> 27:29.454
But you were
operating under my orders.

27:29.505 --> 27:32.891
Don't matter. Durant sure as hell
ain't going to noose your neck.

27:37.230 --> 27:39.564
I'll keep your name out of it.

27:39.632 --> 27:42.351
I know you will.

27:53.079 --> 27:55.614
Welcome, brother.
Thank you for joining us.

27:55.665 --> 27:57.666
Our God's love for us

27:57.750 --> 28:00.919
is the reason
he gave us his laws.

28:04.540 --> 28:07.759
And our love of our God

28:07.827 --> 28:10.512
is the reason we obey his laws.

28:10.596 --> 28:12.681
What's the law about an injun

28:12.765 --> 28:15.267
fornicating with a white woman?

28:15.334 --> 28:17.019
This is a house of God!

28:20.273 --> 28:24.192
You done made it
your own personal cathouse.

28:42.245 --> 28:45.380
Ahhh!

28:49.869 --> 28:52.721
Let the high praise
of God be in their mouth

28:52.805 --> 28:55.891
and a two inches sword
in their hand.

29:03.215 --> 29:05.901
You ok, son?

29:21.664 --> 29:24.383
Thank you.

29:24.467 --> 29:25.684
Miss Ruth.

29:25.768 --> 29:28.103
It's only some
fried pork and beans.

29:28.170 --> 29:31.056
Well, at this moment,
it's a feast fit for a king.

29:32.508 --> 29:34.810
Mick.

29:34.861 --> 29:36.862
Food.

29:41.350 --> 29:43.702
Have you made peace
with your maker, Sean?

29:43.786 --> 29:46.705
Need a priest for that, Ruth.

29:46.789 --> 29:49.875
To hear our sins.

29:49.959 --> 29:53.912
All that really matters is that
you have peace in your heart.

29:53.997 --> 29:56.465
Don't you think?

30:03.205 --> 30:06.391
I don't want
to hear that right now.

30:07.894 --> 30:10.846
All right.

30:10.897 --> 30:12.681
I'll go.

30:12.732 --> 30:14.566
No.

30:15.718 --> 30:18.737
Stay with me.

30:21.441 --> 30:24.225
Your face.

30:24.277 --> 30:26.912
Your voice.

30:28.331 --> 30:31.500
They bring me peace.

31:02.598 --> 31:05.283
It was me.

31:05.368 --> 31:07.569
I killed the foreman.

31:07.620 --> 31:10.105
Yes, of course you did.

31:10.156 --> 31:12.457
With your bare hands, hmm.

31:13.776 --> 31:17.629
I paid a man $20 to kill him.

31:27.807 --> 31:30.759
You're serious.

31:30.810 --> 31:34.262
I didn't know
he was your foreman.

31:34.313 --> 31:37.966
But I wouldn't have acted
differently had I known.

31:38.017 --> 31:40.318
Thomas, he was a murderer.

31:40.403 --> 31:44.156
Under whose authority
did you take this action,

31:44.240 --> 31:46.074
Mrs. Bell?

31:46.142 --> 31:48.810
It was justice.

31:48.861 --> 31:52.581
So... You became

31:52.648 --> 31:56.317
judge, jury and executioner.

31:56.369 --> 31:58.620
As you are doing
with Mr. McGinnes.

31:58.671 --> 32:02.323
After all I've done for you.

32:02.375 --> 32:05.260
You...

32:05.327 --> 32:07.846
Usurped my authority,

32:07.930 --> 32:09.681
put my railroad at risk,

32:09.766 --> 32:12.851
killed one of my most
valuable employees,

32:12.935 --> 32:16.337
and you dare to claim
that it was justice!

32:16.389 --> 32:19.524
It was justice!
An innocent man is going to hang!

32:19.609 --> 32:22.360
Someone has to hang!

32:22.445 --> 32:24.396
Perhaps you would like
to take their place

32:24.480 --> 32:28.033
in the interests of justice.

32:41.380 --> 32:44.549
You lookin' for this?

32:46.552 --> 32:49.704
She's an old piece.

32:49.755 --> 32:53.091
But she still shoots true, huh?

32:54.260 --> 32:57.712
Very flattering.

32:58.714 --> 33:01.066
It was you
agitating the Germans

33:01.150 --> 33:02.734
to hang the McGinnes boys.

33:02.819 --> 33:05.720
Payback for the tar
and feathers, I guess?

33:05.771 --> 33:07.055
No, no, not true.

33:07.106 --> 33:10.058
Any dispute between the celts

33:10.109 --> 33:11.993
and my nordic brethren,

33:12.061 --> 33:14.863
I must side with my brethren.

33:14.914 --> 33:17.065
And like them, I--

33:17.116 --> 33:20.452
I despise the Irish.

33:21.737 --> 33:25.240
See...

33:25.291 --> 33:28.710
I got this idea.

33:28.761 --> 33:32.764
You hate pretty much everybody.

33:32.849 --> 33:35.517
Especially yourself.

33:35.584 --> 33:40.805
Yes, that is where we are
similar, Mr. Bohannon.

33:42.525 --> 33:45.393
But I hate you

33:45.444 --> 33:48.864
more than you hate yourself.

33:51.317 --> 33:54.986
You keep agitating trouble
on this railroad...

33:55.071 --> 33:59.207
You're going to a deep sleep
at the bottom of your muck pile.

33:59.275 --> 34:02.794
There won't be nobody
to mourn or miss you, either.

34:02.879 --> 34:06.715
You will miss me,
Mr. Bohannon.

34:08.134 --> 34:10.552
Yeah.

34:11.637 --> 34:14.723
Will you so kind
as to replace my weapon?

34:14.790 --> 34:16.925
Oh.

34:16.976 --> 34:19.010
Yeah.

34:21.130 --> 34:23.231
Fa!

34:33.223 --> 34:36.659
You should leave this place.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.777
Return to your people.

34:38.862 --> 34:40.996
I don't have
any people anymore.

34:41.063 --> 34:42.665
Thanks to you.

34:45.068 --> 34:47.420
I know.

34:47.504 --> 34:49.922
I know it's--
It's all my fault.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.125
But that's why
you can't stay here.

34:53.210 --> 34:57.930
You can't tell me what
I can and can't do anymore.

34:58.014 --> 34:59.581
I believed in you.

34:59.633 --> 35:02.218
And everything
you told me was a lie.

35:02.269 --> 35:05.104
Jesus can't bring peace
to these people!

35:05.188 --> 35:07.523
And all they want
to do is kill.

35:07.590 --> 35:10.259
Kill my people,
kill each other,

35:10.310 --> 35:12.194
ah, kill everything!

35:12.262 --> 35:15.698
But that's-- that's why
you can't stay here.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.733
I love your daughter.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.985
I'm not going to abandon her.

35:20.070 --> 35:22.655
I'm not like you.

36:07.317 --> 36:09.084
Go ahead.

36:13.089 --> 36:14.924
Mr. Bohannon.

36:14.991 --> 36:18.177
Mr. durant just decided
to let the brothers go.

36:18.261 --> 36:20.296
All by his self
he decided that?

36:20.347 --> 36:21.847
Yes.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.966
Why did he send you
to tell me, then?

36:24.017 --> 36:26.185
He didn't.
I volunteered.

36:26.269 --> 36:29.188
Really? What's
your stake in this?

36:29.272 --> 36:31.023
I think they're innocent.

36:31.107 --> 36:33.609
Think they're innocent?

36:36.780 --> 36:40.232
Mr. Bohannon, go
and set them free.

36:45.188 --> 36:48.374
All right, then.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.492
But hanging might have
been merciful

36:50.544 --> 36:52.494
compared to what that Kraut
butcher is going to do to them.

36:52.546 --> 36:55.631
And you'll protect
them, won't you?

36:56.699 --> 36:59.919
It ain't my job to protect 'em.

37:08.378 --> 37:12.097
I know what you did.

37:12.182 --> 37:14.767
What's that?

37:27.330 --> 37:29.748
What was you and Mrs.
Bell talking about

37:29.833 --> 37:33.402
in the saloon the other night?

37:33.453 --> 37:36.088
What we did together.

37:37.424 --> 37:39.425
Yeah?

37:39.509 --> 37:41.777
Mm-hmm.

37:47.267 --> 37:50.719
Keep a keen edge
on that thing, huh?

37:50.770 --> 37:53.939
Got to.

37:57.644 --> 38:00.729
Yeah.

38:00.780 --> 38:05.534
You come a long way since you
used it on Johnson, didn't you?

38:05.601 --> 38:08.537
Mm-hmm.

38:09.789 --> 38:12.124
Just be careful.

38:12.208 --> 38:15.210
Next time a noose
goes around your neck,

38:15.278 --> 38:19.114
it might not slip off so easy.

38:19.165 --> 38:21.967
Thanks for the warning.

38:28.008 --> 38:30.676
Guten tag, herr Bohannon.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.178
I'm turning
the McGinnes brothers loose.

38:33.263 --> 38:35.397
Mr. Durant's order.

38:35.465 --> 38:39.018
That is unfortunate.

38:41.488 --> 38:44.907
But soon justice does have
a knack of finding a way.

38:44.974 --> 38:49.862
Like a pig to the trough, no?

38:56.836 --> 39:00.155
You need to leave town.

39:00.206 --> 39:02.958
What was that?

39:03.009 --> 39:06.595
There's a train leaving in about an hour.
You need to be on it.

39:13.503 --> 39:15.938
Or what?

39:33.039 --> 39:35.624
This is a free country, by God!

39:35.691 --> 39:37.826
Yeah.

39:37.877 --> 39:40.212
That was about the funniest
damn thing I ever heard.

41:29.989 --> 41:32.407
Was ist loss?

41:45.488 --> 41:48.006
Gott im Himmel!

42:06.842 --> 42:08.360
Sean!

42:08.444 --> 42:11.113
Some help here, please!
