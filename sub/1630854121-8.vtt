scam the taxpayers for? Wait,
I remember: one billion dollars,

00:08.843 --> 00:10.009
that you used to finance

00:10.160 --> 00:12.344
your campaign for governor.

00:12.421 --> 00:15.014
Find me every ounce of dirt

I'm gonna destroy him.

00:19.245 --> 00:20.410
It was my fault.

00:20.429 --> 00:22.095
I should have
seen the signs earlier.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.931
Even if you had, it would
probably have been too late.

00:25.084 --> 00:26.841
And maybe we could grab a drink?

00:26.861 --> 00:27.918
That sounds like
just what I need.

00:27.936 --> 00:30.087
You cool with them together?

00:30.105 --> 00:31.346
Eh, she can do better.

We are here tonight

00:35.685 --> 00:39.872
to honor someone who
has done more for Chastain

00:40.099 --> 00:43.691
than perhaps
any other one person.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.952
He has saved more lives

00:46.105 --> 00:49.239
than can possibly be counted.

00:49.241 --> 00:53.260
For someone who hates
getting dressed up,

00:53.445 --> 00:55.445
you look...

00:55.464 --> 00:58.448
It's not actually
the dressing up I mind,

00:58.450 --> 01:01.876
it's all the pointless
small talk and forced smiling.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.545
(Conrad laughs)

01:03.639 --> 01:05.213
Well,

01:05.232 --> 01:06.973
your dad seems right at home.

01:07.126 --> 01:10.736

Here to present the award

01:12.481 --> 01:15.390
for a lifetime
of service to Dr. Bell

01:15.484 --> 01:18.893
is yet another
powerhouse surgeon

01:18.913 --> 01:21.805

Dr. Kit Voss.

01:27.237 --> 01:28.645
KIT:
Thank you, Marshall.

01:28.664 --> 01:32.073
I'm very happy to be here
tonight to present this award.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.075
I think you all know that

01:34.095 --> 01:37.262
my admiration for Randolph Bell

01:37.414 --> 01:40.599
goes far beyond
his skill as a surgeon,

01:40.768 --> 01:43.327
his dedication as a doctor,

01:43.329 --> 01:45.178
and his kindness
as a human being.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.773
It is my great honor to present

01:48.000 --> 01:50.142

13-year-old male,
Malik Sheridan,

03:21.593 --> 03:22.517
possible overdose.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.261
Unknown substance,
likely opioids.

Narcan, four milligrams,

Multiple doses epinephrine.

Attempted intubation

Hypercarbic arrest.
How long has he been out?

03:39.202 --> 03:41.053
At least 20 minutes.
His friend called 911.

03:43.206 --> 03:44.297
Tally.

Tally, I'm Dr. Hawkins.
What did Malik take?

I don't know.

-A pill.

CADE: Conrad,
his breathing is shallow.

He's gonna arrest again

Pupils still pinpoint.

Go, got it.

04:11.977 --> 04:13.543
Intubating now.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.624
Good bilateral breath sounds.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.134
Get him on the vent.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.095
Is he gonna wake up?

04:23.246 --> 04:24.078
We're going to do
everything we can

04:24.098 --> 04:25.171
to make sure that happens.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.432
Tally, where'd
the pill come from?

04:27.584 --> 04:29.083
This much Narcan should have
pulled him out of this.

04:29.177 --> 04:30.084
Are we missing something?

04:30.178 --> 04:31.995
Cerebral edema?

04:32.014 --> 04:32.938
I hope not.

04:35.834 --> 04:37.192
Go, I got him.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.133
Can I sit down?

05:04.029 --> 05:06.638
He's gonna be so mad.

05:06.865 --> 05:07.955
I shouldn't have called 911.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.808
When his parents find out...

05:09.959 --> 05:11.793
You probably saved his life.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.888
Tally, the pill.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.056
Did you see him take it?

05:16.150 --> 05:17.632
Do you know where he got it?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.818
Amir had it.

05:20.045 --> 05:21.636
Malik's older brother.

05:22.397 --> 05:25.490
He plays football, but he
hurt his back a while ago.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.660
He got a lot of pills
from the doctor.

05:30.814 --> 05:32.480
Careful.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.459
I don't think this pill
is from the doctor.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.170
We got to wash those hands.

05:38.246 --> 05:40.630
Even a small amount on your skin
could be dangerous.

05:41.991 --> 05:43.008
He's stable.

05:43.159 --> 05:44.826
Percocet.
Definitely counterfeit.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.844
Probably fentanyl.

05:45.995 --> 05:47.012
Can you get this tested, fast?

05:47.239 --> 05:49.014
We've got fentanyl test strips
up front.

05:49.165 --> 05:50.015
I'll have results
in five minutes.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.591
Full tox will
take a couple hours.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.169
Tally, we need to call
Malik's parents right now.

05:55.338 --> 05:57.171
Yeah, and we need to find Amir.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.265
These pills
are really dangerous.

05:59.418 --> 06:00.859
If your friends have more,
we got to find them.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.530
You don't want anyone else
to get hurt, do you?

06:10.112 --> 06:11.261
Malik's phone.

06:11.279 --> 06:13.205
The password is 61309.

06:13.432 --> 06:15.499
My birthday.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.194
(line ringing)

06:20.214 --> 06:22.864
I'm not saying
cancel the deposition,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.233
but maybe just postpone it
until we have more information.

06:25.235 --> 06:27.777
I've been deposed
a thousand times.

06:27.796 --> 06:29.036
I'm more worried about Leela.

06:29.172 --> 06:30.947
'Cause the first time
can be a little rattling.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.982
Leela's not the one being sued.

06:32.984 --> 06:33.950
It's you in the line of fire.

06:33.969 --> 06:35.376
The case isn't even close.

06:35.470 --> 06:37.621
I've gone through all
the records. There's nothing.

06:37.639 --> 06:39.564
Claire Williams' sepsis
was so far along

06:39.791 --> 06:41.808
that even if the kidney stones
hadn't masked it,

06:41.960 --> 06:43.460
we couldn't have saved her.

06:43.478 --> 06:45.404
You know that's not
what this is really about.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.313
I know. You think
it's about the governor

06:47.466 --> 06:49.966
and revenge for my performance
at his little press ambush.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.317
It's definitely the governor.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.412
And this lawyer, Costican...

06:53.563 --> 06:55.747
I heard he was the governor's
fraternity brother.

06:55.899 --> 06:57.140
And a big campaign donor.

06:57.233 --> 06:58.491
I can handle him.

06:58.644 --> 06:59.659
He's a snake.

06:59.828 --> 07:01.161
He wants to embarrass you.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.571
Why else would they serve you
a subpoena on stage

07:03.590 --> 07:06.407
in front of hundreds of people
when you're getting an award?

07:06.427 --> 07:07.984
It's not like
you're hard to find.

07:08.077 --> 07:09.261
You're here
at the hospital every day.

07:09.412 --> 07:12.681
Oh, please, just postpone it.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.101
I don't scare that easy.

07:26.354 --> 07:29.856
How is it that a woman who
cuts people open for a living

07:30.008 --> 07:31.675
is nervous about
talking to lawyers?

07:31.693 --> 07:34.194
In the OR they're not
hoping I make a mistake.

07:34.346 --> 07:36.012
Which is exactly what
these lawyers are doing.

07:36.031 --> 07:38.531
Babe, just tell the truth.

07:38.700 --> 07:42.185
What if somehow I end up
saying the wrong thing

07:42.204 --> 07:43.945
and then they use it
against Bell?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.855
It's gonna be fine.

07:45.874 --> 07:46.856
I promise.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.041
How can you be so sure?

07:48.117 --> 07:49.359
Because I know what we did.

07:49.528 --> 07:51.285
I've gone over the records,
just like you.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.954
We checked every box
with Claire.

07:53.031 --> 07:54.306
It was textbook.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.101
And I know what a good doctor
you are.

07:59.871 --> 08:02.189
-You're biased.
-(chuckles)

08:17.164 --> 08:18.163
Test came back on the pill.

08:18.390 --> 08:20.390
It was fentanyl for sure.

08:20.483 --> 08:21.983
-Malik's parents are on the way.
-Good.

08:22.077 --> 08:23.150
Cops should be here soon.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.318
You reach the brother yet?

08:24.412 --> 08:25.670
Tried three times. No answer.

08:25.822 --> 08:29.232
That kid's walking around
with poison in his pocket.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.918
If he hasn't taken it yet,
he will.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.178
Can you track him?

08:33.405 --> 08:35.347
People track their kids'
phones, right?

08:42.097 --> 08:44.397
Amir is at Youngman High School.

08:45.751 --> 08:46.674
It's only two miles away.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.767
Yeah. Go.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.362
Take some Narcan.
Here's extra.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.166
STUDENT:
Help! Please!

09:05.120 --> 09:07.420
Stand back, stand back.

09:09.124 --> 09:10.966
STUDENT:

09:11.793 --> 09:12.884
Is he dead? Oh, my God.

09:13.003 --> 09:15.762
-He's gone.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.392
I got you, bud.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.396
(coughing)

09:25.123 --> 09:25.897
You guys know Amir?

09:26.124 --> 09:28.215
Amir Sheridan.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.476
-He's a football player.
-(phone ringing in distance)

09:30.629 --> 09:33.313
Hey. Come here.
Come here, come here.

09:33.465 --> 09:36.223
Keep him on his side.
Keep talking to him, okay?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.351
(phone continues ringing)

09:38.503 --> 09:40.996
Someone get a teacher out here
until the ambulances comes.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.624
(phone continues ringing)

10:10.168 --> 10:11.526
(sirens wailing in distance)

10:20.287 --> 10:22.120
Don't volunteer anything.
Only answer the question

10:22.197 --> 10:23.363
that's been asked, nothing more.

10:23.515 --> 10:24.848
Yeah, I've done this
before, counselor.

10:24.941 --> 10:25.865
Many, many times.

10:26.017 --> 10:29.185
I've... never lost.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.129
I've never settled.

10:31.356 --> 10:33.465
So, I know you're just
trying to do your job.

10:33.692 --> 10:37.761
But trust me,
this lawsuit is a nuisance.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.475
So, what aren't you telling me?

10:43.626 --> 10:46.645
Costican is not
your ordinary lawyer.

10:46.796 --> 10:47.962
And this...

10:48.131 --> 10:49.222
(chuckles)

10:49.316 --> 10:51.316
is not your ordinary
malpractice suit.

10:51.543 --> 10:52.317
What do you mean?

10:52.394 --> 10:54.635
Most depositions
are pretty tame.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.137
This one won't be.

10:56.231 --> 11:00.066
Costican is a loose cannon.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.110
He's got private detectives
out there

11:02.220 --> 11:03.720
talking to former patients
of yours.

11:03.889 --> 11:06.890
They're digging through
everything.

11:06.983 --> 11:08.224
Combing through records.

11:08.243 --> 11:10.743
Those records are private.

11:10.896 --> 11:11.961
In theory.

11:13.231 --> 11:15.131
But these guys are scary
and well-connected.

11:16.234 --> 11:18.843
We have to be ready
for anything.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.087
So, what are they looking for?

11:22.331 --> 11:25.308
The more important question
is what are they gonna find?

11:26.428 --> 11:29.170
We've got three more
teenage overdoses!

11:29.189 --> 11:30.355
Pronounced one dead
at the scene,

11:30.506 --> 11:31.672
these two were still alive
when I got there.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.432
On it. Bay two.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.191
Lost this kid's pulse

11:33.342 --> 11:34.341
about 90 seconds ago.

11:34.419 --> 11:35.935
Take him to trauma room 12.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.421
This is Amir Sheridan,
Malik's brother.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.014
I think he took a fall
down the bleachers.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.774
Head laceration,
probable rib fractures.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.093
All right, his breathing's
not so hot.

11:44.112 --> 11:45.945
We need to intubate him.

11:46.097 --> 11:47.354
Looks like he took
a hell of a spill.

11:47.449 --> 11:49.449
Page Neuro. Dr. Sutton
needs to take a look at him.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.025
I got this one.
You go get the others.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.460
All right, thank you, man.

11:56.199 --> 11:57.774
HUNDLEY:
Come on, sweetie.
Come back to us.

11:57.867 --> 11:59.125
Let's get ready to intubate.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.593
Pulse-rhythm check.

12:02.705 --> 12:04.614
No pulse.

12:04.632 --> 12:07.225
-Pulmonary embolism?
-Resume compressions.

12:07.376 --> 12:10.395
Let's give him another round
of epi, bicarb and calcium.

12:11.047 --> 12:12.638
Airway definitely not secure.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.733
Preparing to intubate.
I need an RT in here.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.142
I thought it was an overdose.

12:16.294 --> 12:17.902
He passed out and fell.
Head trauma.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.296
Looks like rib fractures
on the right.

12:20.298 --> 12:21.981
Pulse is strong,
so we got something.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.057
Have you checked pupils yet?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.391
Nope, it's all you.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.203
Give me 20 of etomidate
and 150 of sux.

12:28.156 --> 12:31.040
Uneven pupils.
That's not good.

12:31.977 --> 12:33.626
Definite trauma to the brain.

12:42.003 --> 12:44.245
That kid never stood a chance.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.580
By the time Conrad got to him,
he was already gone.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.750
These fentanyl overdoses
just keep climbing.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.269
Crazy.

12:51.496 --> 12:53.772
Pushing past 200 a day,
nationally.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.832
Kids are supposed to learn
from their mistakes,

12:56.001 --> 12:58.001
not die from them.

12:58.019 --> 13:01.112
And this one here is gonna
need both of our expertise.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.530
It's a damn shame.

13:04.859 --> 13:06.659
Meet you in CT.

13:11.182 --> 13:12.865
That's two minutes.

13:13.018 --> 13:13.866
Pause compressions.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.211
We got a pulse.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.780
His brain has been
without oxygen

13:19.874 --> 13:21.040
-for a long time.
-CONRAD: Yeah,

13:21.209 --> 13:22.283
we've given him a shot.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.784
Not time to celebrate just yet.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.194
We'll get him to the ICU

13:25.213 --> 13:26.362
and send him through
the scanner on the way.

13:26.381 --> 13:27.639
Good.
I'll go check on Malik.

13:28.624 --> 13:30.700
Hey, I heard you had a bunch
of overdosed kids in the ER.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.310
I came down, I wanted
to see if I could help.

13:32.387 --> 13:35.054
Uh, yeah, multiple cases
of fentanyl poisoning.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.389
This kid had a PEA arrest
on the way in,

13:36.541 --> 13:39.058
we got him back,
but it's not clear what's left.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.467
So, nothing surgical?

13:40.487 --> 13:43.154
Dr. Austin and Dr. Sutton
have a head trauma

13:43.381 --> 13:44.989
that'll probably
end up in the OR.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.201
Okay, right.
I-I'll check with them.

13:56.819 --> 13:59.212
This one of
the fentanyl overdoses?

13:59.898 --> 14:00.746
So young.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.841
Yeah. 13.

14:03.585 --> 14:06.736
Two of the older ones
are in real trouble.

14:07.496 --> 14:10.515
Another one was dead
at the scene.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.167
You find the rest of the pills?

14:13.186 --> 14:17.522
Yep. Older brother
had them in his pocket.

14:18.416 --> 14:21.008
13 years old, kid probably
never took anything stronger

14:21.027 --> 14:22.810
than an aspirin before.

14:22.921 --> 14:24.253
We should not be saying
they overdosed.

14:24.347 --> 14:26.406
That kid was poisoned.

14:28.109 --> 14:29.200
<i> COSTICAN:</i>
<i> Dr. Devi,</i>

14:29.352 --> 14:31.518
at what point
was it clear to you

14:31.613 --> 14:33.429
that Claire Williams
would need surgery?

14:33.522 --> 14:36.265
Well, when the kidney stone
was resolved,

14:36.434 --> 14:38.376
she developed an acute abdomen.

14:38.527 --> 14:41.713
Culture showed florid
gram-negative bacteremia.

14:41.940 --> 14:42.788
Her lactate was very high.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.440
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:44.459 --> 14:45.775
Have you assisted Dr. Bell
in surgery before?

14:45.793 --> 14:47.293
Yes, many times.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.704
And how many of those patients
have died under Dr. Bell's care?

14:50.798 --> 14:52.515
Object to form.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.287
I don't know
a specific number...

14:58.306 --> 14:59.972
So, you have seen Dr. Bell kill,

15:00.125 --> 15:02.066
or, uh, lose a patient before?

15:02.218 --> 15:04.736
Object to form.

15:04.887 --> 15:05.962
Mr. Costican, please.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.296
There's no jury here.

15:07.315 --> 15:09.490
Theatrics aren't necessary.

15:12.804 --> 15:14.487
Do you believe the surgery
performed by Dr. Bell

15:14.581 --> 15:17.248
was a factor in
Claire Williams' death?

15:17.400 --> 15:21.144
I am certain she would have died
without the surgery.

15:21.162 --> 15:22.253
She was already
in refractory shock

15:22.405 --> 15:24.163
and she was clearly ischemic.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.507
The surgery was the only way
to save her.

15:28.244 --> 15:29.243
<i> COSTICAN:</i>
<i> Were you aware that Dr. Bell</i>

15:29.337 --> 15:31.320
received financial compensation

15:31.339 --> 15:33.673
from a medical device
company, QuoVadis,

15:33.767 --> 15:36.750
whose products he recommended
to Chastain patients?

15:36.844 --> 15:37.827
Objection, relevancy.

15:37.996 --> 15:39.103
No, sir.

15:39.255 --> 15:40.788
Dr. Bell's financial affairs
are not...

15:40.790 --> 15:42.774
So, you were not aware
that artificial heart valves

15:43.001 --> 15:44.167
made by this company

15:44.185 --> 15:46.002
resulted in
patient deaths at Chastain?

15:46.095 --> 15:47.019
Objection, relevancy.

15:47.096 --> 15:50.523
No. I'm not a heart surgeon.

15:50.675 --> 15:52.858
I assume you're familiar
with the symptoms of, uh,

15:53.011 --> 15:55.361
multiple sclerosis?

15:55.530 --> 15:57.029
Yes.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.332
Could you describe them?

16:01.152 --> 16:02.868
Symptoms vary widely
from patient to patient.

16:03.037 --> 16:06.464
-And some may be asymptomatic
for long periods of time...
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:06.541 --> 16:07.298
What would be typical?

16:07.450 --> 16:10.376
MS can cause neural disruption

16:10.528 --> 16:13.045
between the brain
and the rest of the body.

16:13.198 --> 16:14.697
This can cause numbness

16:14.716 --> 16:17.366
or weakness in parts
of the body, tremors, sometimes.

16:17.385 --> 16:19.051
Would any of those
symptoms interfere

16:19.204 --> 16:21.053
with one's ability
to perform surgery?

16:21.206 --> 16:22.480
PALMER:
Object to form.

16:23.057 --> 16:24.465
They could.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.876
But hundreds of thousands
of people in this country alone

16:26.894 --> 16:28.211
are living normal lives with MS.

16:28.304 --> 16:30.396
Plenty of surgeons with MS

16:30.490 --> 16:32.657
who are successfully
operating today.

16:32.884 --> 16:33.807
Thank you, Dr. "Pravish."

16:33.868 --> 16:35.618
It's Pravesh.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.020
Pravesh.

16:38.072 --> 16:40.206
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

16:41.059 --> 16:42.667
Dr. Pravesh,

16:42.818 --> 16:44.651
have you ever heard
Dr. Bell referred to

16:44.671 --> 16:46.462
by the nickname HODAD?

16:49.083 --> 16:50.341
Excuse me?

16:50.418 --> 16:53.011
Have you ever heard
Dr. Bell referred to

16:53.238 --> 16:56.180
by the nickname HODAD?

16:56.332 --> 16:59.909
It stands for
Hands of Death and Destruction.

16:59.927 --> 17:02.145
I don't...

17:05.099 --> 17:07.358
No one refers to Dr. Bell
that way now.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.845
Now.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.656
But in the past?

17:14.892 --> 17:16.993
I don't recall.

17:22.525 --> 17:25.025
Costican is hellbent on arguing
this in a courtroom.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.395
Now, have you stopped
to ask yourself why?

17:27.397 --> 17:30.773
Because I see
a big, waving red flag.

17:30.866 --> 17:35.219
Now, you and I both know that
Randolph is a great surgeon,

17:35.296 --> 17:40.116
but the things that could
come up in a prolonged trial...

17:40.209 --> 17:42.143
You think he should settle?

17:43.304 --> 17:44.136
I do.

17:44.289 --> 17:45.212
But he did nothing wrong.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.547
That might not matter.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.882
This is bigger than
any one patient

17:48.902 --> 17:50.234
or even one doctor.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.979
It's a fragile moment
for Chastain.

17:54.132 --> 17:57.817
If he loses this suit,

17:57.893 --> 18:00.411
we all lose.

to working with you in the OR.

18:24.679 --> 18:26.270
You're up, Dr. Bell.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.942
Just, uh, just give me
two minutes.

18:31.093 --> 18:33.502
So, you're done already?

18:33.596 --> 18:35.154
Yes.

18:35.690 --> 18:36.672
How'd it go?

18:36.691 --> 18:38.699
It was, um, it was fine.

18:41.937 --> 18:42.936
Not great.

18:45.941 --> 18:48.459
Have you seen Jessica?

18:48.611 --> 18:49.352
No.

18:49.445 --> 18:51.036
Will you talk to her for me?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.614

I'm gonna need her help.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.282
<i> COSTICAN:</i>
<i> What are the criteria</i>

18:55.301 --> 18:58.952
used to make a differential
diagnosis of sepsis?

18:59.046 --> 19:00.454
Well, there's no specific test.

19:00.548 --> 19:03.215
A diagnosis of sepsis requires
the presence of infection,

19:03.368 --> 19:05.368
whether it's proven
or suspected.

19:05.461 --> 19:08.053
Usually very low blood pressure,
rapid heart rate.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.373
Sometimes increased
breathing rate, fever.

19:10.391 --> 19:11.965

in Claire Williams

19:11.985 --> 19:13.442
when she was first examined?

19:14.303 --> 19:16.821
I did not perform that exam.

I'm sorry, you...

19:18.883 --> 19:21.308
you didn't examine
your patient before surgery?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.977
BELL:
I did. You referred
to the first examination.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.571
I didn't perform
her initial exam.

19:25.648 --> 19:26.405
Of course I...

19:26.557 --> 19:27.907
examined her prior to surgery.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.408
But still, no diagnosis
of the sepsis

19:29.485 --> 19:32.003

is already in surgery?

19:32.230 --> 19:33.562
-Object to form.

-Sometimes surgery
is exploratory...

19:35.583 --> 19:37.175
that after Claire Williams
was declared dead,

19:37.251 --> 19:39.677
you said to Dr. Devi, quote,

seen the signs earlier"?

Well, apparently,
I have a life to save,

Is he gonna be okay?

21:45.972 --> 21:48.180
I don't know yet.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.644
One of his friends, Robert...

21:56.816 --> 21:58.566
He didn't make it.

22:02.730 --> 22:03.988
Tally?

22:04.215 --> 22:06.807
She didn't take anything.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.201
You're lucky to have her.

22:09.904 --> 22:11.620
You almost died.

22:13.407 --> 22:16.500
She probably saved your life.

22:18.729 --> 22:20.229
My best friend.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.582
-I don't know what
I'd do without her.
-Yeah,

22:23.734 --> 22:25.426
I know the feeling.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.737
When can I see my brother?

22:28.831 --> 22:31.090
He's still in surgery.

22:31.242 --> 22:33.351
But I'll take you up
when he comes out.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.841
BILLIE:
Resecting the dura.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.436
AUSTIN:
How do these kids overdose at
school on a Wednesday morning?

22:44.589 --> 22:46.805
BILLIE:
Conrad told me
he was prescribed Percocet

22:46.957 --> 22:47.940
for the football injury.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.109
And when it ran out...

22:50.261 --> 22:51.702
He probably went
looking for more.

22:51.929 --> 22:53.278
Guessing he found it online.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.447
Most of the counterfeit pills

22:55.541 --> 22:57.708
on the street these days
are fentanyl. It's cheaper

22:57.935 --> 22:59.210
than dirt
and incredibly powerful,

22:59.286 --> 23:00.878
so all the illegal labs
mix it into everything.

23:01.029 --> 23:04.197
AUSTIN:
Poisoning your customers
can't be good for business.

23:04.217 --> 23:07.033
Okay, dissecting down
to the intercostals.

23:07.128 --> 23:08.552
Kelly clamp.

23:10.038 --> 23:12.798
I need double suction.

23:12.892 --> 23:13.966
(sighs)

23:14.118 --> 23:15.300
There's blood everywhere.

23:15.428 --> 23:18.521
Ablate one area
and another one starts bleeding.

23:20.625 --> 23:21.957
Found it.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.401
Cauterizing the source vessel.

23:23.552 --> 23:26.052
Through the intercostals,
into the pleural spaces.

23:26.147 --> 23:27.405
32 chest tube.

23:27.632 --> 23:29.965
BILLIE:
His cortex is very swollen.

23:29.984 --> 23:31.558
I'm not sure
we got here in time.

23:31.577 --> 23:35.413
You've given him the best chance
against permanent brain damage.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.232
There's too many close calls.

23:39.252 --> 23:43.254
This young man is definitely
dancing with death today.

24:00.255 --> 24:01.755
JAYCI:
You need something,
Dr. Sullivan?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.107
Oh, hey, uh, no, I was...

24:03.258 --> 24:05.276
(clears throat)
I was just checking on something

24:05.427 --> 24:07.761
I-I noticed before that was...

24:07.930 --> 24:11.340
You know, I once caught a nurse
swiping drugs off my cart.

24:11.358 --> 24:13.492
Poor thing
was totally strung out.

24:14.695 --> 24:16.120
That's terrible.

24:16.271 --> 24:18.514
-What happened?
-I had to report it.

24:18.532 --> 24:21.517
Lost her job,
destroyed her career.

24:21.610 --> 24:22.126
Sad, really.

24:22.353 --> 24:24.277
She was a great nurse.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.130
That's tough.
(clears throat)

24:26.357 --> 24:27.948
-That's a loss, huh?
-Well,

24:27.967 --> 24:30.951
addiction doesn't discriminate.

24:31.028 --> 24:32.636
Could happen to anyone.

24:33.789 --> 24:35.864
Okay, yeah, uh...

24:35.883 --> 24:37.491
it seems fine now.

24:37.626 --> 24:38.200
Okay.

24:38.293 --> 24:39.727
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

24:47.803 --> 24:49.177
-Finished so soon.
-Yeah.

24:49.230 --> 24:50.321
That was fast. How did it go?

24:50.472 --> 24:51.805
We're on a break,
which I manufactured.

24:51.899 --> 24:53.882
-That bad?
-It was brutal.

24:53.976 --> 24:55.809
What did Marshall say?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.720
It... it was good, routine.

24:57.738 --> 24:59.371
He's totally behind you.

25:01.817 --> 25:02.891
You're a terrible liar.

25:02.985 --> 25:03.984
I'm an excellent liar.

25:04.078 --> 25:05.711
You just know me too well.

25:06.989 --> 25:09.064
The truth is Marshall's worried.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.734
He thinks maybe
you should settle.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.660
(exhales, mutters)

25:13.721 --> 25:16.013
Settling would be admitting
there was a mistake.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.098
And there wasn't one.

25:19.334 --> 25:21.334
I trust your judgment.

25:21.354 --> 25:24.337
-But?
-The stress is bad for you.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.582
-(scoffs)
-And don't tell me
you can handle it.

25:26.584 --> 25:30.085
This isn't about
your emotional fortitude.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.238
It's about your MS.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.866
Okay.

25:36.093 --> 25:37.701
Uh...

25:38.946 --> 25:40.612
No, you're right, I...

25:40.765 --> 25:41.747
As usual.

25:43.934 --> 25:46.043
Uh, yeah, all right, let's...

25:46.120 --> 25:48.462
settle this thing.

25:52.293 --> 25:54.510
♪ ♪

26:21.414 --> 26:24.973
They refused to settle?
Just like that? Just refused?

26:25.067 --> 26:26.975
And, also...

26:26.994 --> 26:29.736
this OR tech from the surgery,

26:29.830 --> 26:31.755
Donald Killian.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.257
What's he saying?

26:33.484 --> 26:36.260
He's saying you were showing
symptoms of MS in the surgery.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.788
What-what symptoms?!
That's...

26:39.790 --> 26:41.081
that's ridiculous.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.842
This guy begged
to be part of the surgery.

26:43.994 --> 26:44.843
He's a plant.

26:44.995 --> 26:46.586
It... it's all payback.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.332
My MS had nothing to do
with Claire dying.

26:50.351 --> 26:53.168
I could have been completely
cured or flat on my back,

26:53.261 --> 26:55.237
she was gonna die from sepsis.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.160
We need to get back.

27:03.030 --> 27:04.321
(sighs)
It's gonna be okay.

27:04.548 --> 27:06.707
-(door opens)
-Of course it is.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.701
(door closes)

27:09.795 --> 27:11.462
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

27:17.044 --> 27:18.636
What do we do?

27:35.062 --> 27:36.970
(knocking)

27:37.106 --> 27:39.381
-Hey, thanks for coming.
-Sure. What's up?

27:39.400 --> 27:43.202
-You look awful.
-C-Close the door, would you?

27:43.979 --> 27:45.570
What's going on?

27:45.723 --> 27:46.664
I'm, um...

27:48.167 --> 27:50.075
I'm in a bit of a jam.

27:50.227 --> 27:51.985
Dad, you're scaring me.

27:52.062 --> 27:53.504
Don't.

28:00.829 --> 28:02.754
Where did you get this?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.907
It was in the operating room.

28:04.925 --> 28:07.184
Left over after a surgery.

28:09.963 --> 28:11.438
I was going to use it.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.767
-On myself.
-You what?

28:15.936 --> 28:18.770
Let me explain, okay?

28:18.864 --> 28:20.772
It was a mistake.
Obviously, I know that, okay?

28:20.866 --> 28:23.075
That's why I called you.

28:24.111 --> 28:25.369
Look, everything
under control, okay?

28:25.596 --> 28:27.946
I... It was-it was
perfectly sound, medically.

28:28.098 --> 28:29.189
I ca-I can
show you the protocol.

28:29.283 --> 28:31.625
What in God's name
are you talking about?

28:32.694 --> 28:34.102
My meds, for...

28:34.196 --> 28:35.713
fatigue and a-anxiety--

28:35.864 --> 28:38.048
I-I... I balance them
very carefully.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.108
They allow me
to perform miracles in the OR.

28:40.127 --> 28:42.277
-It's just, it got...
-This isn't Xanax,

28:42.370 --> 28:44.204
this is Propofol.
This could kill you.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.464
Kincaid, please!
I just, I'm...

28:45.558 --> 28:48.800
I called you, okay?
I need your help. Okay?

28:48.894 --> 28:50.210
So, please.

28:50.304 --> 28:52.879
Look, originally,
they were prescribed. And then,

28:52.973 --> 28:54.306
in the move and...

28:54.400 --> 28:57.067
and then changing doctors,
like...

28:57.294 --> 28:58.961
I can handle
my own medical condition.

28:59.021 --> 29:00.145
Bell is on meds.
He-he...

29:00.297 --> 29:01.813
he couldn't function
without them.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.056
I-I...
It's the same for me,

29:03.108 --> 29:04.466
except my condition
is brain-based--

29:04.635 --> 29:06.635
-fatigue, anxiety, depression.
-Well, if that were true,

29:06.728 --> 29:09.896
you'd be under the care
of a medicating psychiatrist.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.081
-Why aren't you?
-Absolutely.

29:11.233 --> 29:14.293
You're absolutely right.
I-I should be, I just...

29:16.330 --> 29:17.755
We're-we're a little late...

29:17.831 --> 29:19.498
(chuckles)
for that.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.167
Don't you understand
what it's like--

29:22.261 --> 29:24.744
what is required of me
every time I go in there,

29:24.764 --> 29:27.097
being a pediatric surgeon--
what that-what that feels like?

29:27.249 --> 29:29.341
The... Holding the precious
lives in my hands,

29:29.493 --> 29:31.510
the-the parents begging me
to save their children.

29:31.662 --> 29:33.771
-Hour after hour,
day after day...
-Okay, you have to stop

29:33.998 --> 29:35.272
this endless rationalizing.

29:35.499 --> 29:37.349
You're too smart
not to see this for what it is.

29:37.501 --> 29:39.184
-You are an addict.
-Okay.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.004
You know the diagnostic criteria
as well as I do.

29:42.097 --> 29:43.096
I saved Padma's twins.

29:43.173 --> 29:45.098
On my regime.
It works.

29:45.175 --> 29:47.025
-(scoffs)
-The-the pills make it possible.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.601
-But without...
-Oh, my God, this is crazy.

29:48.695 --> 29:50.412
This is crazy.

29:52.182 --> 29:53.499
You're right.

29:54.868 --> 29:56.126
You're right.
(chuckles)

29:56.278 --> 29:59.037
It's like I-I want
to stop, I need...

29:59.131 --> 30:00.947
I need to stop.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.040
And I need your help.

30:02.209 --> 30:05.210
I know that I need help.

30:05.362 --> 30:07.137
What are you asking me for?

30:07.289 --> 30:09.197
Prescribe me my medication.

30:09.216 --> 30:10.456
Just, it-it's legal.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.143
And then, over time,
gradually titrate me off.

30:13.295 --> 30:16.129
Monitor my progress.
We can do this.

30:16.223 --> 30:18.965
Oh, my God.
I am not enabling this.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.152
-You cannot ensnare me
in your addiction.
-Okay, okay, just...

30:22.379 --> 30:24.637
-How dare you?
-Okay, you're right, I'm sorry.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.898
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

30:27.051 --> 30:27.974
You're absolutely right.

30:27.993 --> 30:28.992
I'm just a little desperate.

30:29.185 --> 30:30.977
I'm grasping at straws.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.330
I would never...

30:33.481 --> 30:35.999
I would never
do anything to hurt you.

30:36.151 --> 30:37.751
You know that.

30:41.899 --> 30:43.398
(sighs)

30:44.326 --> 30:46.492
-All right, I will help you.
-Thank you.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.070
We can...

30:48.163 --> 30:49.346
find you the right
rehab facility...

30:49.497 --> 30:53.166
I'm not going to a rehab.
Kincaid.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.260
We're i-we're in the middle
of, uh, uh, fundraising

30:55.337 --> 30:57.245
for the new
pediatric surgical center.

30:57.264 --> 30:59.189
-I... Look,
things are going well.
-I-I'm not

30:59.341 --> 31:00.916
negotiating this with you, Dad.

31:00.934 --> 31:02.250
If you want my help, this is it.

31:02.252 --> 31:03.935
Either you go to rehab

31:04.029 --> 31:05.178
or I have to report you.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.939
Well, you're not
doing that, obviously.

31:08.092 --> 31:09.441
Come on. That...

31:09.535 --> 31:11.093
I would be fired.
My career, everything--

31:11.111 --> 31:12.518
it would-it would
be up in smoke.

31:12.613 --> 31:14.872
There's another way, Kincaid.
I-I can't go to rehab.

31:15.099 --> 31:16.448
Then I'm going to Dr. Voss.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.950
No, please, come...
Uh, anything that you want.

31:19.027 --> 31:20.360
But you cannot tell Voss.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.879
And you cannot tell Conrad.
That's just...

31:22.106 --> 31:24.030
It's just a line we can't cross.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.425
I told you,
I am not bargaining with you.

31:26.534 --> 31:28.385
Hawkins will go to Voss.
You know that.

31:28.612 --> 31:30.721
And then everything
is over for me.

31:31.873 --> 31:34.040
All right? No one's gonna
have a-a pediatric surgeon

31:34.059 --> 31:36.635
on their staff
who has a drug problem.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.710
All right?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.379
Think of all that would be lost.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.397
Years and years of training,

31:40.624 --> 31:43.483
all the lives
that I still could save.

31:44.719 --> 31:47.720
I can fix this.
With your help.

31:47.814 --> 31:49.448
Just don't tell anyone.

31:50.484 --> 31:53.118
Come on, you can
do that much for me.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.988
If you go to rehab...

31:57.141 --> 31:59.750
I won't tell anyone.

31:59.977 --> 32:01.627
Not even Conrad.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.905
I will lie for you,

32:05.925 --> 32:07.740
one last time.

32:07.834 --> 32:11.094
And then... I'm done.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.474
Thanks.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.252
Thank you.

32:19.329 --> 32:21.480
I'll make some calls.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.194
(sighs)

32:29.448 --> 32:30.855
You okay?

32:31.008 --> 32:32.699
Yeah.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.601
You want to talk?

32:35.696 --> 32:37.270
No, I'm good.

32:37.364 --> 32:39.289
Hey, um...

32:39.441 --> 32:41.866
can we rain check
on tonight?

32:41.961 --> 32:44.519
My dad has a conference
in Dallas

32:44.538 --> 32:47.506
and I said I'd drive him
to the airport.

32:48.542 --> 32:49.708
Of course.

32:49.860 --> 32:52.043
After this kind of day,
I just want to get home

32:52.196 --> 32:55.714
and hold on to Gigi
till she's 18.

32:55.866 --> 32:57.599
See you tomorrow?

33:07.561 --> 33:09.894
AUSTIN:
Well, that was
hairier than expected.

33:10.047 --> 33:11.713
Understatement of the year.

33:11.806 --> 33:12.990
This young man is lucky

33:13.141 --> 33:14.232
you were on you were
your A game today, Sutton.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.642
Mm. It's a pleasure
riding shotgun

33:16.662 --> 33:18.236
with you, Dr. Austin.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.813
Placing an epidural drain.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.557
Now, before I close the skin,

33:22.576 --> 33:25.627
why don't you give us
a look at those pupils, Dr. Chu?

33:28.990 --> 33:32.250
Sluggish, but equal
and reactive.

33:32.402 --> 33:34.160
All right, well, that's hopeful.

33:34.254 --> 33:35.995
BILLIE:
(sighs) But not definitive.

33:36.089 --> 33:38.331
It'll be days
before we really know.

33:38.425 --> 33:40.592
Yeah, well, he's young,
that helps.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.912
So, whatever happens,
it's gonna be a long road.

33:43.930 --> 33:46.598
I hate these wait-and-see cases.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.842
Take a horrible tragedy
and amp it up with uncertainty--

33:49.862 --> 33:52.487
feels cruel.

33:53.257 --> 33:54.680
(sighs)
All right,

33:54.700 --> 33:57.592
let's close him up
and get him off this table.

33:57.611 --> 33:59.202
AUSTIN:
Hear, hear.

35:08.348 --> 35:09.998
Uh, it's-it's pretty routine.

35:10.016 --> 35:12.609
-Uh, listen.
-What's up?

35:12.836 --> 35:13.926
I want to ask you a favor.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.261
All right.

35:15.355 --> 35:17.339
Just between us, I'm just having

35:17.507 --> 35:19.023
a little bit of a flare-up.
It's nothing serious.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.343
-Mm-hmm.
-Just a little
numbness in my hand,

35:21.361 --> 35:22.510
a little tremor.

35:22.679 --> 35:24.121
And I don't want to make
a big thing out of it.

35:24.272 --> 35:25.605
It would upset Kit.

35:25.699 --> 35:28.125
So, I was thinking just a quick
hit of prednisone...

35:28.276 --> 35:29.459
would knock it down.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.445
Shouldn't your neurologist
prescribe that?

35:32.572 --> 35:35.857
Well, yeah, but she's away at
a conference this weekend, so...

35:36.026 --> 35:37.359
I understand.

35:37.377 --> 35:38.710
I'll give it to you, just...

35:38.804 --> 35:40.804
you need to see your
neurologist when she gets back.

I don't beg, Governor.

36:33.841 --> 36:35.250
But I am willing to negotiate.

36:35.419 --> 36:38.286
So, why don't you tell me
exactly what you want

36:38.346 --> 36:40.030
and we can try and sort this out
like adults.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.589
Well, you know,
I don't give a rat's ass

36:41.608 --> 36:42.699
about Chastain Hospital.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.760
Although my polling
is awfully convincing that

36:45.779 --> 36:49.247
the high price of health care
is a winning issue.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.359
You know, the truth is...

36:53.453 --> 36:55.861
your hubby picked a fight
with the wrong man.

36:55.956 --> 36:58.773
He tried to embarrass me.

36:58.866 --> 37:00.866
And I'm afraid that can't stand.

37:00.961 --> 37:03.261
I got to make an example of him.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.130
So, what I want

37:06.283 --> 37:09.284
is for Dr. Randolph Bell
to lose his job,

37:09.302 --> 37:11.544
possibly his medical license,

37:11.638 --> 37:15.106
and whatever shred
of a reputation he still enjoys.

37:16.384 --> 37:19.051
The truth is, Governor,
that you miscalculated.

37:19.071 --> 37:22.054
Because you think
Randolph Bell is like you:

37:22.223 --> 37:24.966
vain, self-important,
small-minded.

37:24.985 --> 37:27.193
Hungry for money and power.

37:27.304 --> 37:29.412
But the thing about
men like that-- men like you--

37:29.639 --> 37:32.582
is that more than anything,
they're afraid.

37:32.809 --> 37:33.825
Sad, really.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.252
But Randolph Bell is not afraid.

37:35.445 --> 37:37.161
Because he's not
fighting for himself,

37:37.314 --> 37:38.496
he's fighting for what's right.

37:38.648 --> 37:42.425
You think that
by attacking his reputation

37:42.594 --> 37:44.410
and livelihood that
it's gonna make him back down,

37:44.504 --> 37:45.653
scare him away?

37:45.747 --> 37:48.098
Well, it scared him enough
to send you here.

37:48.174 --> 37:49.657
Oh, he doesn't know I'm here.

37:49.676 --> 37:52.769
And, honestly, I only came
because I'd rather see Dr. Bell

37:52.996 --> 37:56.164
saving lives than wasting
his time fighting with you

37:56.257 --> 37:57.089
and your little attack dog.

37:57.183 --> 37:58.924
I thought you came to negotiate.

37:59.019 --> 38:00.593
Yeah, I know.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.114
But now that we've talked,
I realize there's no point.

38:04.265 --> 38:06.024
You've got nothing to offer.

38:06.118 --> 38:09.268
Yeah, my lawyer tells me
we have a strong case.

38:09.362 --> 38:11.346
You don't.

38:11.364 --> 38:13.364
And when, eventually, they
throw out your lawsuit,

38:13.517 --> 38:16.108
expect to see me
on the courthouse steps

38:16.202 --> 38:18.444
with a dozen
of Atlanta's best doctors

38:18.463 --> 38:19.521
talking to the press

38:19.689 --> 38:22.114
about how nuisance
malpractice lawsuits

38:22.134 --> 38:24.509
are driving up the cost
of hospital care.

38:25.304 --> 38:27.429
I think it's a winning issue.

38:42.729 --> 38:44.529
(indistinct chatter)

38:50.220 --> 38:52.070
That was a rough one, huh?

38:52.222 --> 38:55.165
Well, my part was a cakewalk

38:55.316 --> 38:57.500
compared to what Billie did.

38:57.610 --> 38:59.243
You know, there's a reason
a picture of your face

38:59.396 --> 39:02.564
-is on the side of the building.
-(chuckles softly)

39:02.657 --> 39:04.174
He's stable.

39:04.401 --> 39:07.761
We won't know what the damage is
until he wakes up.

39:09.089 --> 39:10.180
How's the little brother?

39:10.331 --> 39:12.924
He's gonna be okay.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.577
Those poor parents.

39:15.595 --> 39:17.912
You know, I don't think
I ever quite understood

39:17.931 --> 39:20.081
what it meant
to have your children

39:20.100 --> 39:23.568
walking around
a dangerous world.

39:25.197 --> 39:29.491
You know, I've talked
to countless parents, but now...

39:30.260 --> 39:31.368
...it hits different.

39:31.595 --> 39:33.328
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

39:34.264 --> 39:36.039
My twins aren't even crawling

39:36.190 --> 39:38.282
and I'm terrified
for them already.

39:38.435 --> 39:40.210
Nothing really prepared me
for how different

39:40.361 --> 39:43.454
being a doctor felt
after having Gigi.

39:43.607 --> 39:45.531
Never truly realized
how fragile we are

39:45.625 --> 39:48.033
until I held my own
flesh and blood in my arms.

39:48.128 --> 39:49.535
AUSTIN:
Yeah.

39:49.629 --> 39:51.704
Now, some part of my brain's
always thinking about

39:51.798 --> 39:54.599
the different ways
Gigi might get hurt.

39:56.453 --> 39:57.635
You know, you're not
really selling

39:57.787 --> 40:00.379
-the parenthood thing here.
-(chuckles softly)

40:00.473 --> 40:04.317
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

40:06.238 --> 40:07.553
But thank God
I don't have twins.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.240
That's not helping
either, Hawkins.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.157
Hey.

40:19.233 --> 40:22.477
Hey.
How'd the deposition go?

40:22.495 --> 40:23.611
Pretty smooth,

40:23.613 --> 40:25.830
though that lawyer
was a piece of work.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.406
Yeah.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.260
I wouldn't want to be Bell
right now, or Kit.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.320
Like dealing with
his MS diagnosis

40:32.338 --> 40:34.338
wasn't bad enough, and now this.

40:34.491 --> 40:37.325
Well, I think with
the right person by your side,

40:37.343 --> 40:39.677
you can deal with
even the worst stuff.

40:39.829 --> 40:43.498
Well, thankfully neither of us
have to face what they do,

40:43.516 --> 40:47.185
but if we ever do, I definitely
want you riding shotgun.

40:47.337 --> 40:50.171
Mm. Although I'm pretty sure
you're riding shotgun.

40:50.264 --> 40:53.098
(chuckles) You know
I'm a better driver than you.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.767
In a car, maybe.

40:54.936 --> 40:58.663
But in life? Uh...

41:02.944 --> 41:03.943
(sighs)

41:03.962 --> 41:05.444
What are you still doing here?

41:05.464 --> 41:07.038
I thought
you'd gone home hours ago.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.447
Just waiting for you.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.967
There's nothing for me
at home if you're here.

41:11.118 --> 41:13.428
You're sweet.

41:15.381 --> 41:17.390
What's wrong?

41:18.384 --> 41:20.518
I may have done
something stupid.

41:21.963 --> 41:24.230
Well, I think that's unlikely.

41:24.966 --> 41:26.483
I met with the governor.

41:27.227 --> 41:29.152
I know.
But I really thought

41:29.303 --> 41:30.636
we could come to
an understanding.

41:30.730 --> 41:34.157
Get him to drop the lawsuit
or at least settle.

41:34.384 --> 41:35.474
And that didn't happen?

41:35.568 --> 41:38.903
I thought maybe
we were being paranoid.

41:39.055 --> 41:41.222
But it's real and it's personal.

41:41.315 --> 41:43.649
This guy wants to destroy you.

41:44.577 --> 41:48.913
I may have
lost my temper, slightly.

41:49.065 --> 41:52.008
Why are you smiling?

41:52.159 --> 41:53.993
This is far from over.

41:54.070 --> 41:56.012
We are in for
one hell of a fight.

41:56.163 --> 41:57.013
No, I know.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.740
But whatever they bring at us,

41:58.833 --> 42:00.225
we'll face it.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.232
(knocking)

42:10.695 --> 42:11.694
Are you ready?

42:13.273 --> 42:15.698
We're really gonna do this, huh?

42:17.260 --> 42:19.369
I wanted to, um...

42:19.596 --> 42:22.446
stop by my place
and-and get a few things.

42:22.599 --> 42:25.250
-Toothbrush.
-I'll buy you a new one.

42:29.030 --> 42:30.938
How long a drive is it?

42:31.032 --> 42:32.632
Couple hours.

42:35.536 --> 42:36.553
You know this place?

42:36.704 --> 42:40.798
No, but they've got
a great reputation.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.116
They focus on treating doctors.

42:42.285 --> 42:43.284
There's no shortage of docs

42:43.303 --> 42:45.562
who struggle with addiction.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.275
I'm scared, Kincaid.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.610
