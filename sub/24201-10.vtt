01:17.666 --> 01:20.750
Tents no longer stand
at Caligari Carnival.

01:20.833 --> 01:23.250
Any researcher traveling the Hinterlands

01:23.333 --> 01:27.041
wouldn't be able to tell
there'd been a carnival here at all.

01:27.125 --> 01:30.125
All that remains is a poorly dug pit...

01:32.250 --> 01:33.916
a few burnt remains...

01:43.916 --> 01:45.083
And ash.

01:49.291 --> 01:50.666
On nights like this,

01:50.750 --> 01:54.250
I think of the fearsome beasts
lurking in the darkness,

01:54.333 --> 01:58.083
and I wonder which part of the beast
is the most frightening.

02:00.833 --> 02:03.416
Some say the teeth
or the claws or the hair,

02:03.500 --> 02:04.833
if you are allergic.

02:06.708 --> 02:10.416
I believe that the most frightening part
of any beast is its belly,

02:11.375 --> 02:14.458
because if you are seeing the belly,
you have been devoured.

02:14.541 --> 02:17.041
And for that reason,
the phrase "in the belly of the beast"

02:17.125 --> 02:20.125
means "in a terrible place
with little chance of escape."

02:20.916 --> 02:23.250
My name is Lemony Snicket.
Before this episode is over,

02:23.333 --> 02:25.833
"in the belly of the beast"
will be used three times,

02:25.916 --> 02:27.791
not counting the times
I've already used it.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.875
And for that reason,
I would stop watching now,

02:30.958 --> 02:32.666
before this story gets so frightening

02:32.750 --> 02:36.166
that you feel as if you are
in the belly of the beast.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.125
That time doesn't count either.

02:42.791 --> 02:45.375
We don't have long.
Olaf will be here any minute,

02:46.416 --> 02:48.666
and we are in the belly of the beast.

02:49.666 --> 02:51.125
Why're you a fortune-teller?

02:51.208 --> 02:54.125
A fortune-teller is just a librarian
with smoke and mirrors.

02:56.500 --> 03:00.750
I may have lost you at Prufrock Prep,
but I never forgot you, or your friends.

03:01.458 --> 03:02.833
After the Quagmires were kidnapped,

03:02.916 --> 03:04.625
I headed to the city to rescue them.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.958
That's where I met Jacques Snicket
and joined VFD.

03:07.041 --> 03:10.666
- The Volunteer Fire Department.
- They were trying to save the Quagmires.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.083
We almost had them
at the Village of the Fowl Devotees.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.208
But Olaf captured us.

03:14.291 --> 03:17.250
I made a deal with Esmé
to get us out of jail.

03:17.333 --> 03:20.916
Jacques stayed behind. I went to find
our bravest agent in the field.

03:21.708 --> 03:25.125
This carnival is a place
that VFD gathers information.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.208
There is no real Madame Lulu.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.208
It's just an alias
for whichever volunteer is stationed here.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.208
It's a rotating position.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.833
The previous Madame Lulu
took my taxi to the hospital

03:42.916 --> 03:46.791
to retrieve a very important sugar bowl
before Esmé could get her hands on it.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.208
But she hasn't come back.

03:49.875 --> 03:51.083
And Jacques...

03:53.500 --> 03:55.125
well, he's not coming back, either.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.083
- He tried to help us.
- He was very brave.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.375
The Quagmires are safe.
We rescued them.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.250
I'm so glad to hear that.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.291
You truly are remarkable children.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.291
But Olaf is here now
and we're all in danger.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.250
I've tried to stall him
till the previous Madame Lulu returns.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.375
She'll know what to do.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.208
But he's getting suspicious.
I don't know how long I can fool him.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.125
You fooled us. It's a great disguise.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.541
So is yours.
I almost didn't recognize you.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.000
How did you?

04:27.083 --> 04:30.166
A certain gleam in the eye
indicating a sharp acumen.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.583
Volunteers have eyes like that.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.125
Madame Lulu...

04:35.208 --> 04:36.916
- Olivia.
- Olivia.

04:37.541 --> 04:41.000
We found a message
saying one of our parents survived.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.375
You told Olaf it was true.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.416
I'm sorry.
I only said that to keep him here.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.500
But if Jacques believed
that there was a survivor,

04:51.583 --> 04:54.791
then it must be true.
His research is never wrong.

05:00.958 --> 05:02.166
I've been doing some reading.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.750
The Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations.

05:03.833 --> 05:04.666
You found it.

05:06.541 --> 05:09.791
VFD has a secret headquarters
in the Mortmain Mountains.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.583
If one of your parents really is alive,
this is where they'd be.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.916
- We have to go there.
- I'm going to take you.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.333
Jacques told me headquarters
is on this map,

05:21.416 --> 05:24.166
- but it doesn't seem to be marked.
- May I see it?

05:25.291 --> 05:27.541
Markings on maps are like codes.

05:27.625 --> 05:30.458
This blue line is a stream.
These green houses are campgrounds.

05:30.541 --> 05:32.291
Look, the Valley of the Four Drafts. VFD.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.916
But there's no markings in the valley.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.791
Just a stain where Jacques
must have accidentally spilled coffee.

05:36.875 --> 05:41.250
Maybe it wasn't an accident. Headquarters
might have a secret way of marking it.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.041
I think the stain is the headquarters.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.166
We have to get there.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.916
We're stranded
till the previous Madame Lulu gets back.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.458
Do the roller coaster carts
have engines?

05:51.541 --> 05:54.291
They do, but they don't run.
The radiator keeps overheating.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.833
That sounds like a fan belt problem.

05:55.916 --> 05:58.750
You need to transmit torque
from the engine to cool the radiator.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.375
I can get it running,
but it may take all night.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.250
Then we'll leave
first thing tomorrow.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.666
I'll pack my library and food
for the journey.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.625
I can keep Olaf distracted until then.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.041
I've wanted to help you

06:10.125 --> 06:11.958
since the moment
you set foot in my library.

06:12.583 --> 06:16.041
We've all lost people we love,
but we've found each other.

06:16.125 --> 06:20.625
And I promise, if one of your parents
really is alive, we'll find them, too.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.083
But now we must hurry
before Count Olaf gets back.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.208
There's something I don't understand.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.083
Our parents were in VFD,
but so was Olaf.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.333
So is VFD a noble organization
or a wicked one?

06:33.375 --> 06:35.958
Jacques said there was a time
when VFD was noble.

06:36.041 --> 06:39.375
They were dedicated to putting out fires,
literal and figurative.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.250
There was a schism.
You know what that means?

06:41.333 --> 06:43.708
A division between members
of the same organization.

06:43.791 --> 06:46.625
One side decided
it was better to start fires.

06:46.708 --> 06:49.208
One night at the opera, a sugar bowl...

06:49.291 --> 06:52.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for an interruption!

06:53.500 --> 06:54.458
Quickly.

06:55.250 --> 06:58.708
If you're in a tent,
if you're in a caravan,

06:58.791 --> 07:02.958
if you're in the men's room,
wash your hands and come on out!

07:05.833 --> 07:07.333
Right this way, folks.

07:07.416 --> 07:09.083
How do we look?

07:09.166 --> 07:10.875
Your ribbon.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.041
Okay.

07:17.291 --> 07:21.750
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
freaks and normal people,

07:22.416 --> 07:23.833
I am pleased to announce

07:23.916 --> 07:27.083
a brand-new attraction
at Caligari Carnival.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.583
That is good news,
because this popcorn is stale.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.791
It is good news.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.541
This show is about to get
a lot more entertaining,

07:33.625 --> 07:35.000
not just because I'm back in it.

07:35.583 --> 07:41.166
Who here is familiar
with the ancient art of sorcer-enary?

07:41.833 --> 07:45.541
Wait. Of sorcer-generarry?

07:45.625 --> 07:46.458
It means magic.

07:46.541 --> 07:51.000
Oh! Sorcery!
You're trying to say sorcery.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.541
Yes! Sorcery.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.083
How right you are.

07:55.166 --> 08:00.000
I'm surprised that you could hear, girlie,
with something being in your ear.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.250
What?

08:02.208 --> 08:03.500
Oh! Behold!

08:03.583 --> 08:04.666
- Astounding!
- Incredible!

08:04.750 --> 08:07.708
That's not that impressive.
Maybe if it was doves.

08:07.791 --> 08:08.958
Really?

08:10.041 --> 08:12.041
Well, then how about this?

08:12.958 --> 08:15.375
A scarf. Two scarves,
three scarves...

08:15.458 --> 08:17.041
Darling, you're scaring him.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.000
All right.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.791
One more. There's your dove.
It's dead, thanks.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.625
That's a little impressive.

08:22.708 --> 08:25.083
You know what's a lot impressive?

08:26.791 --> 08:30.708
More impressive than 17 scarves
and a dead dove?

08:30.791 --> 08:31.750
Behold!

08:34.207 --> 08:37.541
A pit of starving lions!

08:46.458 --> 08:51.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a very special surprise for you.

08:51.541 --> 08:54.958
Lions are carnivorous,
which means they eat meat.

08:55.041 --> 08:57.000
- That's not a surprise.
- Everybody knows that.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.750
But these lions
have not been given any meat.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.166
Not a single drop of food.
They're starving.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.333
- That seems cruel.
- And not much of a show.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.208
Come back tomorrow, Mr. Heckler-man,

09:07.291 --> 09:12.250
when we will randomly select one freak
from the House of Freaks

09:12.333 --> 09:16.416
and we will watch
as the lions devour them.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.166
You can tell a lot about a person

09:22.250 --> 09:26.250
from their reaction to the news
that someone will be eaten by lions.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.583
Most wicked people would be thrilled

09:28.666 --> 09:31.333
while most normal people
would be horrified.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.166
A person might be unable
to disguise her glee,

09:34.250 --> 09:37.125
while another person
might have to pretend to be gleeful,

09:37.791 --> 09:39.833
if she is in disguise.

09:40.958 --> 09:45.875
Finally, some people might be horrified,
but still manage to spot something useful.

09:45.958 --> 09:49.708
Something long and starchy,
designed to enhance certain sauces,

09:49.791 --> 09:54.375
but to the trained eye,
shaped a little like a solution.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.250
I saw your face at the pit.

09:58.333 --> 10:01.000
- You've got a solution.
- The tagliatelle grande.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.041
You mean the giant noodle
Olaf uses as a whip?

10:03.125 --> 10:05.833
I'll use it as a fan belt
to repair the engine.

10:05.916 --> 10:08.708
- We can fix it when everybody's sleeping.
- Dinner's ready.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.833
Enjoy. It could be
the last tom kha gai you ever eat.

10:11.916 --> 10:14.291
- Tom kha who?
- Soup common to Thailand,

10:14.375 --> 10:17.291
made from chicken, vegetables,
mushrooms, ginger,

10:17.375 --> 10:19.291
coconut milk and water chestnut.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.125
Chabo grated ginger
with her teeth.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.916
For a feral monster,
helpful in the kitchen.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.541
If she wasn't a freak,
she could be an excellent chef.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.541
She's gonna be an excellent chef.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.208
Not if she's eaten by lions.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.583
I am not crazy about this devouring plan.

10:32.666 --> 10:36.333
But the visitors to the carnival
were excited, so it's good for business.

10:36.416 --> 10:37.916
Everybody loves violence.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.958
Especially when combined
with sloppy eating.

10:41.041 --> 10:41.875
That's not a dilemma.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.958
None of you should jump to your death
to entertain.

10:44.041 --> 10:46.791
There are better things to do
than get eaten.

10:46.875 --> 10:51.041
- Like what?
- Like, literally, anything.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.083
Y'all never know
when an opportunity will knock.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.583
Open up.

10:55.916 --> 10:59.708
- Hurry up. I want to talk to you.
- I'm hurry upping, Ms. Squalor.

10:59.791 --> 11:00.791
Let's be on our best behavior.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.958
It's not often
a normal person wants to talk to us.

11:03.041 --> 11:05.833
We'll be good. I won't bend
into a single strange position.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.833
I'll only use my left hand.
No, wait. My right... My left.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.958
I am Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor,

11:17.041 --> 11:20.708
and as you can see from my gown,
I love freaks.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.000
- That's so nice of you.
- Yes, it is.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.666
I had this gown made
to show how much I love them.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.416
See this stuffed animal,

11:28.500 --> 11:29.833
like a hunchback,

11:29.916 --> 11:33.375
and this creepy little face
is like I have two heads.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.125
You look very freakish.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.291
I'm not really a freak.
I'm a normal person.

11:37.375 --> 11:40.125
But I wanted to show you all
how much I admire you.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.333
I admire you so much, I consider you
more than employees at a carnival.

11:44.416 --> 11:46.666
I consider you
to be some of my closest friends.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.375
Oh, Esmé, do you really mean it?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.458
Of course I mean it.

11:51.541 --> 11:53.791
I'd rather be with you
than with the finest people.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.208
Wow. I've never had a normal person
call me a friend.

11:56.291 --> 12:00.291
Well, that's what you are.
You're all my freaky friends.

12:00.375 --> 12:04.416
And it makes me terribly sad
that one of you will be eaten by lions.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.458
I have real tears in my eyes
thinking about it.

12:06.541 --> 12:09.333
Close friend, don't be sad.

12:09.416 --> 12:10.375
I can't help it.

12:10.458 --> 12:15.458
But I have an opportunity for you all
that might make us all very, very happy.

12:15.541 --> 12:19.208
We were just saying that
an opportunity could come any minute.

12:19.291 --> 12:22.375
Well, that's completely true.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.000
Gather around the fire.
I'll tell you about it.

12:26.791 --> 12:29.916
Now that we split these logs
and started this fire like you asked,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.583
what's this opportunity?

12:31.666 --> 12:35.875
I am offering you the chance
to quit your jobs at the House of Freaks,

12:35.958 --> 12:38.958
and join Count Olaf and myself
in his troupe.

12:39.041 --> 12:42.416
Do you think a normal man like him
wants to work with freaks like us?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.750
Of course he would.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.666
Count Olaf doesn't care whether
you're hideously freakish or normal,

12:46.750 --> 12:48.916
as long as you obey his every whim
beyond all reason.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.625
Wow! What an opportunity!

12:51.708 --> 12:53.000
I had a hunch you'd be excited.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.750
- No offense.
- None taken.

12:54.833 --> 12:59.625
If you're interested,
all you have to do is one simple task.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.208
Commit a murder.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.916
- Okay, sounds good.
- Did you just say...

13:08.000 --> 13:08.916
During the lion show,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.958
Olaf will choose one freak
to jump into the pit.

13:11.041 --> 13:15.583
But I want whomever is chosen
to throw Madame Lulu in instead.

13:15.666 --> 13:17.750
You want us
to murder Madame Lulu?

13:17.833 --> 13:19.208
Think of it as a dramatic exercise

13:19.291 --> 13:22.791
to show Count Olaf
you're brave enough to join his troupe.

13:22.875 --> 13:26.333
Throwing Madame Lulu into a pit
of lions doesn't strike me as brave.

13:26.416 --> 13:27.791
Just vicious and cruel.

13:28.625 --> 13:32.291
How can it be vicious and cruel
to give people what they want?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.291
You want to join Count Olaf's troupe.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.041
The crowd wants to see someone
eaten by lions.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.875
I want Lulu thrown into the pit.

13:39.958 --> 13:41.708
It doesn't sound so bad.

13:41.791 --> 13:45.208
Tomorrow, one of you
will have the exciting opportunity

13:45.291 --> 13:47.416
to give everybody what they want!

13:47.500 --> 13:49.833
Why do you want Lulu thrown to the lions?

13:49.916 --> 13:52.750
Oh, you'll understand when you're older.
Hmm.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.083
Maybe not you.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.333
Is something wrong?

13:57.416 --> 13:59.166
I just offered you a job,
which was generous.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.833
It is very generous, Ms. Squalor.

14:01.916 --> 14:04.875
I just don't feel comfortable
throwing Lulu to the lions.

14:04.958 --> 14:06.291
I agree.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.625
- Chabo, too.
- I bet Chabo only half agrees.

14:09.708 --> 14:12.541
I bet her wolf half can't wait to see
Lulu get eaten.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.291
- I'm excited.
- Me, too.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.125
I really want to join Olaf.

14:16.208 --> 14:19.500
Maybe you can convince
your two-headed coworkers.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.166
Consider this.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.000
Maybe Lulu doesn't deserve
to get thrown to the lions.

14:24.083 --> 14:26.791
People don't always get
what they deserve.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.375
And who knows that better
than the two of you?

14:32.791 --> 14:35.291
After all, you're freaks.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.583
I'll let you sleep on it.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.458
Nice work, Sunny.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.000
The curious thing
about being told to sleep on it,

14:48.083 --> 14:50.125
is that you usually can't.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.875
"Sleep on it" is a phrase which here means

14:52.958 --> 14:57.000
"to go to bed thinking about something
in the hopes of reaching a conclusion."

14:57.083 --> 15:00.791
It's much easier to sleep
when you've made up your mind.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.250
It's run-down.
This won't be easy.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.041
- What?
- The ribbon Sunny made

15:14.125 --> 15:16.291
out of the hospital bracelet,
I can't find it.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.625
Uh...

15:19.166 --> 15:20.416
Will this work?

15:21.625 --> 15:23.750
Violet was troubled
about the roller coaster,

15:23.833 --> 15:26.750
and whether she could repair it
with nothing but a tagliatelle grande

15:26.833 --> 15:28.083
and the cover of night.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.458
Sunny, untangle the ivy.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.916
Get me pliers
and a half-inch wrench.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.791
I'm gonna take a look.

15:39.875 --> 15:42.375
Klaus was troubled
about Madame Lulu's map,

15:42.458 --> 15:45.125
and whether the course he charted
was the best way.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.375
And Sunny was troubled
about the long drive ahead

15:47.458 --> 15:50.166
and whether Olivia
would pack enough food for the journey.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.875
- The lions aren't sleeping.
- They don't sound ferocious, just sad.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.583
I feel sorry for them.

15:59.666 --> 16:01.541
They don't deserve to be starved.

16:01.625 --> 16:02.708
Esmé was right.

16:02.791 --> 16:05.416
People don't always get what they deserve.
Neither do lions.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.583
I can't understand

16:06.666 --> 16:10.000
why Hugo, Colette and Kevin would
join people that do wicked things.

16:10.833 --> 16:13.291
Maybe they're happy someone's
treating them like normal people.

16:13.375 --> 16:16.416
Maybe that's why Count Olaf's troupe
works for him.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.500
They don't think
they have anywhere else to go.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.875
Then we're lucky.
We know where we're going.

16:27.125 --> 16:30.916
The Baudelaires were troubled
about the mountain headquarters

16:31.000 --> 16:33.791
and whether one of their parents
was alive and waiting for them.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.166
Think you can shorten this noodle?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.958
But they should have been troubled
about Olaf,

16:39.041 --> 16:41.541
who, at that moment,
was sleepless himself.

16:41.625 --> 16:47.583
Hmm. Listen to them. That hunger.
That insatiable desire.

16:47.666 --> 16:49.166
Those poor creatures.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.833
They'll have someone to eat soon.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.791
Let's talk about what I want. The location
of the surviving Baudelaire parent.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.833
You said you would give me
the answers tomorrow.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.750
It's after midnight.
That makes it tomorrow.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.375
Come back in the morning, my Olaf.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.458
Spirits, they talk when they talk.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.500
They'd better.

17:06.583 --> 17:11.875
I'm a patient man, Lulu, but patience
is like a grating foreign accent.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.208
It can wear thin.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.958
Wait. Wait.
Spirits, they are sending me vision.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.875
Yes. It's a terrible thing
you did to a noble man.

17:23.958 --> 17:26.708
And now, I am getting a name.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.875
Jacques Snicket.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.083
Jacques Snicket got in my way.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.583
Ask the spirits how that turned out.

17:43.416 --> 17:44.250
What happened?

17:44.333 --> 17:48.750
A crystal ball has accident.
Good thing Madame Lulu buy in bulk, huh?

17:50.250 --> 17:54.375
You wouldn't have had any guests
from the Heimlich Hospital, would you?

17:54.458 --> 17:55.875
No. No.

17:55.958 --> 18:00.291
Handsome Olaf is Madame Lulu's
first visitor in long time.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.125
Really?

18:05.666 --> 18:07.750
Then how did this get here?

18:08.625 --> 18:13.458
Spirits work in mystical ways.

18:13.541 --> 18:17.041
Also, Madame Lulu recently have checkup.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.916
Regular health care is important.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.375
Hmm. I'll see you tomorrow, my Olaf.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.166
You certainly will.

18:57.541 --> 18:58.958
- Well done.
- Thank you.

18:59.041 --> 19:01.541
The engine should be able
to get us to the mountains.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.791
Will it hold the weight
of Lulu's archival library?

19:03.875 --> 19:05.375
Let's test it.

19:11.166 --> 19:14.708
Riding a roller coaster is the sort
of activity normal children do.

19:16.666 --> 19:17.500
Here we go.

19:41.708 --> 19:47.250
There are few truly happy moments
in the lives of the Baudelaire children.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.125
This is not one of them.

19:58.625 --> 19:59.541
But it's close.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.041
When meeting a volunteer,

20:02.125 --> 20:05.125
you may determine their allegiance
with the use of a code phrase.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.583
"The world is quiet here."

20:07.666 --> 20:10.791
This may sound curious,
like the motto of a secret organization,

20:10.875 --> 20:13.500
or something a stranger might say
when he picks you up in his taxi

20:13.583 --> 20:16.000
and invites you to use your talents
to benefit the world.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.791
There'll be losses along the way.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.041
We may never triumph, not completely.

20:20.666 --> 20:24.625
We may be defeated, at least for a time.
But we will never disappear.

20:24.708 --> 20:28.041
Not so long as there are noble,
well-read people...

20:28.125 --> 20:30.916
- To take up the torch.
- ...to take up the torch.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.458
Going somewhere?

20:46.541 --> 20:49.750
Oh, there you are, my Olaf.
You are so early.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.166
Spirits still sleeping, like lazy goat.

20:52.250 --> 20:57.458
Go get breakfast wine spritzer with Esmé,
and come back in, say, an hour. Yes.

20:57.541 --> 21:00.708
Spirits will be ready
for big fortune-telling show.

21:00.791 --> 21:03.041
I won't need a fortune-telling show
this morning.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.291
- You don't?
- No.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.458
Things are different. Plans have changed.

21:06.875 --> 21:11.375
I've got my own show now.
And look, the early crowd arrives.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.000
Right this way to the lion pit, folks!

21:14.083 --> 21:15.416
You, too.

21:18.666 --> 21:22.750
Step this way for violence
and sloppy eating!

21:22.833 --> 21:24.833
Has anyone seen the boss's giant noodle?

21:34.125 --> 21:36.125
Look, Mrs. Bass. Freaks!

21:36.208 --> 21:39.291
Don't say my name out loud.
I'm on the lam.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.416
Sorry, I'm just very excited.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.666
"One of these freaks will be eaten!"

21:43.750 --> 21:45.125
I sure hope so.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.208
I haven't had any fun
since I robbed that bank.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.916
Oh, I'm starving for entertainment.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.083
I hear the lions are starving, too.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.125
What was that about a bank?

22:05.333 --> 22:07.291
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:07.833 --> 22:11.625
this may be the most exciting day
of your entire lives.

22:11.708 --> 22:14.708
Welcome, welcome, welcome...

22:14.791 --> 22:18.958
to the Caligari Carnival's Big Top Finale!

22:21.791 --> 22:22.875
Thank you.

22:25.541 --> 22:28.208
I am your ringmaster, Count Olaf,

22:28.875 --> 22:32.166
but a different Count Olaf than the one
you've read about in the papers,

22:32.250 --> 22:33.666
who is dead.

22:33.750 --> 22:37.041
Incredible! Who knew there were so many
counts with one eyebrow named Olaf?

22:37.125 --> 22:40.250
We're both very handsome.
But enough about me.

22:40.333 --> 22:47.125
Ladies and gentlemen,
inside this pit are two starving lions.

22:49.375 --> 22:55.916
And standing beside said pit
are five delicious freaks!

22:57.041 --> 22:59.291
I'm glad this is my last day
in these clothes.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.708
Soon I'll be part of Olaf's troupe.

23:01.791 --> 23:03.583
Are you really gonna push Lulu?

23:03.666 --> 23:06.375
I'll do anything if it means
never having to look like a freak again.

23:06.458 --> 23:09.666
Look closely at all these freaks.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.916
Observe Hugo's hideous hump.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.583
Cackle at Colette's
cockamamie contortions.

23:16.666 --> 23:21.250
Giggle at the absurdity
of Kevin's ambidextrous arms.

23:21.333 --> 23:25.750
Snicker at Beverly and Elliot,
the two-headed freak.

23:26.333 --> 23:32.708
Laugh so hard you can hardly breathe
at Chabo the Wolf Baby.

23:32.791 --> 23:35.125
- I hope it's the man with sores!
- Or the woman with money!

23:36.916 --> 23:39.041
I am not a freak.
I'm a member of the audience.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.208
I have a dermatological condition.

23:41.291 --> 23:44.125
And this isn't money.
Uh, these are algebra quizzes.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.708
I don't care who it is.
I just hope this circus has clowns.

23:46.791 --> 23:48.041
I like the sad ones.

23:49.833 --> 23:54.750
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time
for the choosing ceremony to commence.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.458
The names of each and every freak

23:57.541 --> 24:00.666
have been written down
on small pieces of paper,

24:00.750 --> 24:05.916
folded up, and placed inside the box
that this lovely young lady is holding.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.666
I don't think she's lovely.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.916
Play along.
We'll think of something.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.166
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:12.250 --> 24:19.208
I will reach inside the box,
pull out one piece of paper,

24:19.291 --> 24:24.250
unfold it,
and read the name of the freak out loud.

24:24.333 --> 24:29.333
Then that freak
will then walk down this wooden plankway,

24:29.958 --> 24:34.958
jump into the pit,
and we'll all watch as the lions eat him.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.208
Or her.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.375
Or her.

24:40.458 --> 24:43.416
Before we begin,
does anyone have any questions?

24:43.500 --> 24:45.583
Why do you get to pick the name?

24:45.666 --> 24:46.958
It was my idea.

24:47.041 --> 24:48.916
Is this legal?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.708
What... Don't spoil the fun, boy.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.916
If you're going to ask questions,
you might as well wait in my car.

24:55.958 --> 25:01.583
Ladies and da-da-da,
I am now reaching my hand inside the box.

25:03.916 --> 25:07.375
I am pulling out one piece of paper,

25:07.458 --> 25:13.125
which I will unfold very slowly,
to increase the suspense.

25:13.791 --> 25:16.500
A grown man, unfolding paper. Amazing.

25:16.583 --> 25:20.500
I learned how to amaze crowds
by working in regional theater.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.625
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:25.708 --> 25:29.500
I am now unfolding
the first fold in the piece of paper.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.083
I feel morally queasy.

25:34.375 --> 25:37.041
It could be from eating this hot dog
I found on the ground.

25:37.125 --> 25:41.666
I have just unfolded the second fold
in the piece of paper!

25:41.750 --> 25:46.500
There are only five...
four more folds left.

25:46.583 --> 25:47.666
Is this gonna be scary?

25:47.750 --> 25:50.875
Don't worry, Trixie. This was advertised
as family entertainment.

25:50.958 --> 25:54.000
I'm sure whoever is eaten by lions
deserves it.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.791
No one deserves to get eaten.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.208
Except maybe Count Olaf.

25:57.958 --> 25:59.250
You thinking what I'm thinking?

25:59.333 --> 26:01.041
I'm thinking it.

26:01.125 --> 26:04.250
I did one more fold,
and that was the last fold!

26:04.333 --> 26:06.375
What does it...

26:07.041 --> 26:08.166
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:08.958 --> 26:13.541
today's lucky freak
proves that two heads are better than one.

26:13.625 --> 26:17.375
Beverly and Elliot, step on up.

26:20.208 --> 26:22.250
- It's a wicked thing to do.
- What choice do we have?

26:26.791 --> 26:28.916
Thank you.
We're thrilled to be chosen.

26:29.000 --> 26:29.958
You're welcome.

26:30.041 --> 26:36.000
Now, jump into that pit so we can all
watch you get devoured by lions.

26:45.291 --> 26:47.416
Get in there!

27:14.541 --> 27:15.666
What's the problem?

27:16.708 --> 27:19.750
- My other head and I were thinking.
- Thinking with both heads.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.083
Instead of watching a freak jump
into the lion pit,

27:22.166 --> 27:23.416
wouldn't it be more exciting...

27:23.500 --> 27:25.958
To watch a freak get pushed?

27:26.041 --> 27:27.875
This would be
more violent, please.

27:27.958 --> 27:28.875
Yeah, do it!

27:28.958 --> 27:32.625
Yes. I'd like to see that two-headed freak
thrown to the lions.

27:32.708 --> 27:35.291
I'd like to see someone pushed
into the pit.

27:39.541 --> 27:43.750
And who, pray tell, do you imagine
performing such a dangerous job?

27:43.833 --> 27:44.791
You.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.416
After all, you are the star of the show.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
That's true!

27:47.583 --> 27:51.375
I'd like to see the ringmaster
throw that freak into that pit!

27:53.375 --> 27:55.541
With pleasure.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.708
I am deeply honored to have been asked.

28:11.791 --> 28:16.083
But I'm afraid I couldn't possibly go
any further than here.

28:16.166 --> 28:19.416
- Why not?
- I'm allergic to cats.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.791
Really?

28:21.708 --> 28:24.208
Wow. I didn't even know
you had allergies, boss.

28:24.291 --> 28:27.166
I have an idea! Madame Lulu,

28:27.250 --> 28:29.333
you walk the plank
and throw the freak to its death.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.833
Of course!

28:30.916 --> 28:34.416
After all, Madame Lulu
is the reason we're all here today.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.541
What do you think, violence fans?

28:36.625 --> 28:40.000
Let's see Madame Lulu
throw Beverly and Elliot in the pit!

28:40.083 --> 28:42.041
Hit her with something!
That'll get her moving.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.166
That will not be necessary,
please.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.208
I'm positively gasping with suspense.

28:54.791 --> 28:57.416
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.875
Stop whispering.

28:59.583 --> 29:01.333
We're increasing suspense.

29:01.416 --> 29:03.958
The suspense has been increased enough.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.916
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.541
If Madame Lulu
is not brave enough to do it,

29:08.625 --> 29:12.458
then whoever volunteers
will get a special reward.

29:12.541 --> 29:15.125
I'm brave enough!
So are Kevin and Colette!

29:15.208 --> 29:17.166
Freaks that are brave?
Don't be ridiculous.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.583
We are brave!

29:18.666 --> 29:23.166
Count Olaf, let us prove it to you,
and then you can employ us.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.416
- Employ you?
- Oh, what a wonderful idea!

29:25.500 --> 29:26.541
I'll do it!

29:26.625 --> 29:28.625
- No, I'll do it!
- No, I'll do it! With both hands!

29:28.708 --> 29:30.875
I'll do it! I don't want a freak
for a coworker.

29:30.958 --> 29:34.000
Ahh!

29:35.958 --> 29:37.250
I'll do it for Esmé!

29:39.500 --> 29:41.833
I should get that reward.
I live on a teacher's salary.

29:41.916 --> 29:45.666
I don't even care who gets eaten.
I just want to feel alive!

29:45.750 --> 29:48.041
I never knew this show
involved audience participation.

29:49.791 --> 29:51.125
I can't wait anymore.

29:51.208 --> 29:53.416
I'm ready to push someone myself.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.750
Trust me.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.500
- No!
- Go!

30:06.583 --> 30:08.250
- But...
- I'm right behind you.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.708
I've been behind you all along.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.541
Go!

30:16.916 --> 30:21.791
You're no fortune-teller.
You're that school librarian!

30:21.875 --> 30:24.708
I'm more than that. I'm a volunteer.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.041
Well, thank you for volunteering.

30:29.916 --> 30:33.291
Now it's time for your special reward.

30:46.791 --> 30:49.083
I never had the privilege
of meeting Olivia Caliban,

30:49.166 --> 30:50.958
but I do know my brother loved her.

30:51.541 --> 30:56.166
I know she was armed with curiosity,
a well-defined moral compass,

30:56.250 --> 30:58.375
and a well-curated collection of books.

30:59.291 --> 31:03.500
In other words, she was like
many librarians I've known.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.625
A brave and noble person

31:07.708 --> 31:10.958
who did not deserve to end up
in the belly of the beast.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.500
- That sounded like...
- Olivia.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.916
If she's dead, it's our fault.
We thought to push Olaf.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.250
We can't think about that now.
We have to get out of here.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.708
I always thought it would be entertaining
to see someone eaten by lions,

31:34.791 --> 31:35.958
but that was...

31:36.041 --> 31:37.666
- Horrifying.
- Terrifying.

31:37.750 --> 31:39.708
- Messy.
- That could've been me.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.500
It could have been any of us.

31:42.791 --> 31:46.000
- I want to go home.
- Me, too.

31:48.958 --> 31:49.958
The book.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.500
Olivia promised she'd find it for us.

31:56.583 --> 32:00.916
She was a great person
and a great librarian.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.875
- The show's not over yet.
- Count Olaf.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.750
- What are you cowards doing here?
- They might be cowards,

32:13.833 --> 32:15.875
but I'm prepared to offer them
a place in my troupe.

32:15.958 --> 32:17.916
That's very kind of you to offer,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.875
but you don't want us cowards
in your troupe.

32:19.958 --> 32:22.708
Sure we do. You never know
when you might lose an associate.

32:22.791 --> 32:24.208
Look at Madame Lulu.

32:24.291 --> 32:25.708
You don't have a choice.

32:25.791 --> 32:29.083
We're burning down this carnival
starting with that rickety roller coaster.

32:29.166 --> 32:30.541
See for yourself.

32:37.625 --> 32:39.791
No.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.333
You see, if you don't join us,
where can you possibly go?

32:44.208 --> 32:45.666
Where are you going?

32:46.458 --> 32:47.291
Hello.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.000
Give...

32:54.625 --> 32:57.083
I haven't seen one of these in years.

32:57.166 --> 32:59.041
A brown stain?
You saw that this morning.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.541
- Coded stain.
- Oh.

33:00.625 --> 33:04.125
It's to mark a secret location
without anyone else noticing.

33:04.208 --> 33:08.750
And this stain happens to mark
the secret location of VFD headquarters.

33:08.833 --> 33:11.375
I haven't been there in years.
Not since that masked ball

33:11.458 --> 33:15.250
when I failed to push a woman
in a dragonfly costume off a cliff.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.666
Who knew those wings worked?

33:16.750 --> 33:19.416
A map to the VFD headquarters.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.416
Yes. That must be where
the survivor of the fire is hiding.

33:23.500 --> 33:27.083
It seems like Madame Lulu
gave us one last answer after all.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.333
I'm really going to miss her.

33:29.416 --> 33:33.291
Hmm. Pack your mittens, kitten.
We're going to the Mortmain Mountains.

33:33.958 --> 33:36.375
I wonder if Lulu
left anything else useful here.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.875
I don't see anything useful.

33:41.291 --> 33:43.333
I think you're lying to me.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.416
My other head is telling the truth.

33:45.500 --> 33:49.541
Well, then what is that box of food
doing there?

33:49.625 --> 33:52.833
Don't you think food would be useful
on a long journey?

33:55.250 --> 33:57.916
Chabo compliments you on your cleverness.
We hadn't noticed it.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.083
That's why I'm the boss,

33:59.166 --> 34:02.791
and I boss you
to carry that crate to my car.

34:02.875 --> 34:07.541
But first,
I want you to light this tent on fire.

34:09.083 --> 34:09.916
Really?

34:10.000 --> 34:13.708
Yes, really. You're with us now, freaks.

34:13.791 --> 34:15.916
Really light this tent on fire.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.875
Really destroy all these papers and notes

34:18.958 --> 34:21.000
and the rest
of Madame Lulu's boring clutter,

34:21.083 --> 34:24.000
and then meet me at the car
when you're done.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.458
Chabo, you're coming with me.

34:27.916 --> 34:31.833
- Chabo would prefer to stay with us.
- I could care less.

34:31.916 --> 34:35.291
I am the man in charge here,
not this feral little monster.

34:35.375 --> 34:38.208
Come... Just stop... Stop growling!

34:40.083 --> 34:42.708
Nice wolfie.

34:53.041 --> 34:57.000
You know, you're lucky that there are
so many books and films here.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.166
They're highly flammable.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.750
Burn this tent down

35:01.833 --> 35:05.750
and then you can join
that little wolf baby in my acting troupe.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.708
It's time to take up the torch.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.750
We're not going with Olaf.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.291
He already has Sunny,
and he burned our ride out of here.

35:30.375 --> 35:33.875
And riding with him
is the only way to get to the mountains.

35:35.083 --> 35:37.833
If we set that fire,
we're as bad as he is.

35:37.916 --> 35:41.333
If we don't, we'll never find out
if one of our parents survived.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.333
I know just how you feel.

35:47.750 --> 35:50.000
My first time was hard, too.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.875
Let me help you with that.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.916
Get the food.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.041
You can ride in the gift caravan.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.708
We're going to pull it behind us.

36:28.791 --> 36:31.250
With so many new recruits,
we're getting mighty crowded.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.208
Ow, your hooks are hurting me.

36:34.291 --> 36:36.166
- Get in the trunk, freak!
- Okay.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.541
I know a knot called the Devil's Tongue.
It might hold better. I can tie it.

36:39.625 --> 36:42.208
That's a relief.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

36:46.916 --> 36:48.250
It was horrifying.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.791
That anonymous tip promised
I'd find the Baudelaires,

36:50.875 --> 36:52.375
but all I saw were freaks

36:52.458 --> 36:54.750
and a fortune-teller
who got devoured by a lion.

36:54.833 --> 36:58.166
Then everything caught fire.
I'm glad that ticket was comped.

36:58.958 --> 37:01.458
I'm on my way home now,
but I have to make a detour first.

37:01.541 --> 37:02.750
I'm giving a teacher a ride

37:02.833 --> 37:05.750
and she insists on
a private tour of the bank.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.500
- Need to make a deposit?
- A withdrawal.

37:07.583 --> 37:10.208
Oh! What's for dinner?

37:25.208 --> 37:27.875
Here we are, riding off into the sunset.

37:27.958 --> 37:29.083
It's the afternoon.

37:29.791 --> 37:31.333
That's not the point.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.291
The point is,
we are going to be very, very rich.

37:36.916 --> 37:41.083
And the surviving Baudelaires
are about to be very, very dead.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.583
Do you think Sunny will be okay
with Count Olaf?

37:43.666 --> 37:45.916
Nobody's okay with Count Olaf.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.750
But it's only
until we reach the mountains.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.458
As soon as we're together,

37:49.541 --> 37:51.541
we'll escape
and get to the headquarters.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.750
What do you think we'll find there?

37:55.083 --> 37:57.250
Sometimes a story ends
before it's over

37:57.333 --> 38:03.125
with unanswered questions,
unresolved plots, lingering suspense

38:03.208 --> 38:05.541
blanketing the world like snow.

38:05.625 --> 38:07.958
Like smoke from a suspicious fire.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.208
This is Larry Your-Waiter.

38:09.291 --> 38:13.333
I learned the survivor of the fire
is headed to headquarters. I'm on my way.

38:15.541 --> 38:16.750
Is that smoke?

38:16.833 --> 38:20.583
I myself am in suspense
about the current fate of the Baudelaires.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.333
And there are other details
I've yet to discover,

38:23.416 --> 38:28.125
such as the fate of my late brother's taxi
and location of a certain sugar bowl.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.791
And the identity
of the previous Madame Lulu,

38:33.875 --> 38:37.458
though reliable sources tell me
it's a woman I know very well.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.416
It can be frustrating to live in suspense.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.291
Not knowing what's around
the next curve in the road.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.833
You may feel
as if you are on the edge of a cliff,

38:48.916 --> 38:50.625
not knowing if you will fall.

38:50.708 --> 38:53.958
How sharp the rocks are at the bottom,
or if you will have time to scream.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.750
But life is like that.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.583
It's a cliff-hanger.

39:02.708 --> 39:06.708
Beverly, Elliot,
press the red button and speak to me.

39:07.583 --> 39:10.125
- We're here.
- Look out the window.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.375
- We are.
- The other window.

39:25.250 --> 39:27.875
- Stop! No!
- What are you doing? Stop it.

39:27.958 --> 39:31.500
I didn't need a fortune-teller to tell me
where the Baudelaire brats were hiding.

39:31.583 --> 39:33.750
I'd figured that out all by myself.

39:33.833 --> 39:36.583
So, allow me to tell you your future.

39:36.666 --> 39:42.291
A great deal of suffering and pain
and then a long fall to rock bottom.

39:43.166 --> 39:45.583
Do you know how that feels? Because I do.

39:45.666 --> 39:47.916
But things are looking up for me.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.833
I'm cutting all ties
with my past failures.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.333
Get it?

39:52.416 --> 39:55.500
Because I'm actually cutting the rope
that you tied...

39:55.583 --> 39:58.125
I'm sure they get it, darling.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.625
Goodbye, Baudelaires.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.666
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

40:23.416 --> 40:25.250
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

40:28.916 --> 40:30.916
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

40:31.000 --> 40:36.166
Down they go, into the belly of the beast.
