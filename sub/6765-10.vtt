00:09.509 --> 00:10.969
{\an3}Looks like the
only real damage

00:11.052 --> 00:12.846
{\an3}this kid did
was to himself.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.556
WOMAN (over radio):
Any probable explanations?

00:14.639 --> 00:17.767
Not really. We discovered
evidence of drugs on the scene,

00:17.851 --> 00:19.978
but for all we know, this could
have been a suicide attempt.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.981
Paramedics are en route
to Metro General now.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.859
Either way, it's a waste
of a life.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.746
(indistinct radio transmission)

{\an5}WOMAN (over radio):
Copy. Go ahead with one
milligram Narcan IV push

00:49.674 --> 00:51.593
and assist with respiration
as needed.

00:51.676 --> 00:52.802
We'll see you in five.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.012
Got it.

The paramedics administered

{\an1}It is my imagination,

Well, it's a vital part

02:46.833 --> 02:48.376
{\an3}of your medical
education, honey.

02:48.459 --> 02:53.256
Residents are supposed to
make your life miserable.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.258
{\an1}At least
he's still breathing.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.386
Look at the rapid eye movement.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.890
He's definitely

03:01.973 --> 03:04.142
Yeah, probably.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.771
{\an1}You know, in what
anthropologists

03:08.855 --> 03:10.106
{\an1}used to call
"primitive cultures,"

03:10.189 --> 03:13.067
the shamans believed that

03:13.151 --> 03:15.278
whenever someone
was unconscious,

03:15.361 --> 03:20.241
what was really going on was
a battle for the person's soul.

{\an5}WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Ponset,

03:27.874 --> 03:29.334
(whooshing)

03:30.835 --> 03:32.295
Welcome back, Mr. McKay.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.464
We thought you were a goner
there for a while.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.132
How are you feeling?

03:36.215 --> 03:37.717
A little weird.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.594
Well, that's what happens
when you go into a coma.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.931
(sighs)

03:43.014 --> 03:45.224
You look like my high school
vice principal.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.601
Do I?

03:46.684 --> 03:48.144
Mrs. Teasley?

03:48.227 --> 03:49.520
I know the doctors

03:49.604 --> 03:52.523
are anxious to give you
a thorough examination.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.526
Dylan, we've been so worried
about you.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.654
What did you start doing
speedballs for?

03:57.737 --> 04:01.324
{\an6}TEASLEY:
You remember Suzanne and
Kevin, don't you, Dylan?

04:01.407 --> 04:04.827
And their daughter, Erica?
You remember them, right?

04:04.911 --> 04:06.829
Clearly, he's been through
an ordeal.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.123
Well, he'll feel a lot better
once we give him his injection.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.292
Erica:
<i>Please help me, Dylan. Help!</i>

04:11.376 --> 04:13.711
<i>Please help.</i>

04:13.795 --> 04:17.257
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, wait,
we're not gonna hurt you!

04:17.339 --> 04:18.216
{\an3}Grab him!
Dylan!

04:29.519 --> 04:32.522
{\an5}ERICA:
Please, Dylan,
if you ever loved me,

(subway cars rumbling)

04:55.628 --> 04:57.130
(horn blaring)

05:00.216 --> 05:01.509
He looks like

05:01.592 --> 05:04.429
someone I was very close to
a long time ago.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.389
And you remind me
of the last med student

05:06.472 --> 05:07.515
they booted out of here

05:07.598 --> 05:09.934
for missing Grand Rounds.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.060
I'll stop by later.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.187
I will be here.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.277
(crowd cheering)

05:27.702 --> 05:30.705
DAVID:
Football video essay, take one.

05:30.788 --> 05:31.831
Hut!

05:34.417 --> 05:35.835
(ripping flag)

05:47.764 --> 05:49.307
(Steve laughing)

05:54.353 --> 05:56.481
Yeah! Yeah!

05:56.564 --> 05:58.441
The great PB! Whoo!

05:58.524 --> 05:59.942
(applauding)

06:00.026 --> 06:02.945
There's something about
a flag football tournament

06:03.029 --> 06:05.615
on the first weekend in November
on a college campus

06:05.698 --> 06:09.577
that's so... reassuring,
so... traditional,

06:09.660 --> 06:12.288
so... nauseatingly masculine,

06:12.371 --> 06:14.999
that we decided to strap
on our helmets and go out there

06:15.083 --> 06:16.959
and win one for the Gipper.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.002
Clare, just stop.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.588
{\an3}Look, I don't think
I want to use this opening.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.464
{\an1}Why not?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.257
Because, would you
look at these guys?

06:23.341 --> 06:26.302
{\an1}I mean, this is some serious
stuff going on out here.

06:26.385 --> 06:29.138
{\an1}This tournament goes on
for almost four straight days.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.808
I mean, this is
the real deal.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.268
{\an1}This is for all the guts
and glory.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.021
{\an3}David, please, don't
ESPN on me here, okay?

06:37.105 --> 06:39.941
{\an3}Look, I'm just doing
a little blip here about

06:40.024 --> 06:42.068
why jocks need to win trophies

06:42.151 --> 06:44.487
and why otherwise intelligent,
young women

06:44.570 --> 06:46.489
{\an3}feel that they should
let themselves

06:46.572 --> 06:48.491
become subjected to this.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.159
I gotta know,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.994
{\an3}why are all these
guys wearing

06:52.078 --> 06:53.329
{\an3}their jock straps
on the outside?

06:53.412 --> 06:54.372
{\an3}I mean...

06:54.455 --> 06:57.041
Clare, those aren't
their jock straps.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.167
Those are the, uh, flags

06:58.251 --> 06:59.669
{\an1}that the players rip off
of each other.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.295
{\an1}It's the whole point
of the game.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.883
Oh, I thought it was some
kind of fashion statement

07:05.967 --> 07:07.176
or something.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.012
Yeah, look, why don't we
just pack up and quit

07:10.096 --> 07:11.013
while we're ahead?

07:11.097 --> 07:12.348
We could do that, yeah.

07:12.431 --> 07:13.891
We should do that.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.518
{\an5}STEVE:
You guys didn't eat your
Wheaties today, huh?

07:15.601 --> 07:16.519
Go get 'em, guys.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.520
All right, guys.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.855
We got this game on ice.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.189
{\an3}Hey, it ain't over
till it's over, Muntz.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.190
Hey, give it
a rest, Bran.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.692
{\an1}I don't think
much is gonna happen

07:22.775 --> 07:23.526
in the next three minutes

07:23.609 --> 07:25.236
{\an1}for these guys
to pull this thing out.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.531
Hey, hey, hey, where are the
mighty men of the KEG house?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.615
Hey, Mr. Sanders!

07:29.699 --> 07:30.449
{\an1}Oh, it's Rush,
son. Rush.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.368
You want formality,
go join Sigma Chi.

07:32.451 --> 07:33.202
What a surprise.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.204
{\an1}Yeah, thanks for
keeping me in the loop.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.373
If it wasn't for the fact
I was at the booster club,

07:37.456 --> 07:38.916
I never would've known
the tournament started.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.251
Sorry. It must've
slipped my mind.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.294
Hey, Kelly, baby.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.086
How are you?

07:42.170 --> 07:43.462
KELLY:
Hi.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.340
{\an1}Oh, how my son ever let
you go, I will never know.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.717
{\an1}Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.093
{\an1}STEVE:
Ah, don't worry about it.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.219
{\an3}It's our third-string
in there.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.721
We're up 28 points.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.055
{\an1}Listen to me,
will you, please?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.348
When I was doing this thing,

07:54.432 --> 07:55.725
{\an1}we won it three years
in a row.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.268
How could I forget?

07:57.351 --> 07:59.312
{\an5}CINDY:
<i>I just wish</i>
<i>you hadn't lost your temper.</i>

07:59.395 --> 08:02.064
Excuse me,
I did not lose my temper.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.108
{\an3}All I said to
Valerie was this:

08:04.192 --> 08:06.277
"If you want to die a slow and
painful death from emphysema,

08:06.360 --> 08:07.778
"that's your prerogative,

08:07.862 --> 08:10.072
{\an3}but do it outside where
I don't have to smell it."

08:10.156 --> 08:12.408
{\an1}Look, you know
how I feel about smoking.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.244
It's just that she's been
through so much this past year.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.287
{\an3}You want to know,
honestly,

08:16.370 --> 08:17.288
{\an3}when I walked into
that bathroom,

08:17.371 --> 08:19.248
{\an3}I was much more concerned
about breathing in

08:19.332 --> 08:20.124
all that secondhand smoke

08:20.208 --> 08:22.335
than I was about her
emotional stability.

08:24.754 --> 08:28.633
Um, I'm really sorry, Jim.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.218
I only started smoking

08:30.301 --> 08:31.636
after my father...

08:33.386 --> 08:34.764
{\an3}you know.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.267
But if it's that big
of a deal, I'll quit.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.268
{\an1}Hey,

08:39.352 --> 08:40.770
don't quit on my account.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.563
Do it because you want to live
a long and healthy life.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.108
Yeah, right.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.654
(phone rings)

08:53.366 --> 08:55.117
Hello, the Walsh residence.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.912
No, this is Valerie.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.833
Iris McKay

09:02.917 --> 09:05.586
calling from Hawaii.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.808
{\an1}Steve, you're blowing this
way out of proportion!

09:18.891 --> 09:20.101
{\an3}What... Wait
just a second.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.978
{\an3}Don't tell me we didn't
blow a huge lead

09:22.061 --> 09:24.021
the moment he started talking
about his Knute Rockne thing.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.148
{\an1}But we didn't blow the lead.
We're in the playoffs.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.109
{\an1}We've got another game
in 90 minutes, so get over it.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.068
Yeah, it's so obvious

09:29.151 --> 09:31.153
your father is using
the fraternity as a way

09:31.237 --> 09:35.324
to recapture all the faded glory
of being a big man on campus.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.285
{\an3}Duh!

09:37.368 --> 09:39.662
{\an3}I'm so embarrassed
for him, though!

09:39.745 --> 09:41.247
For him or for you?

09:41.330 --> 09:42.665
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.292
Let's not turn this
around on me, okay?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.502
{\an3}This is his problem,
not mine.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.504
Okay.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.840
Lo.. ser!

09:50.923 --> 09:52.341
(chuckles)

09:53.718 --> 09:55.177
{\an5}STEVE:
You just don't know.
You don't know.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.345
(Kelly giggling)

09:56.429 --> 09:59.140
Nat, I need a couple mega
cheeseburgers to go, okay?

09:59.223 --> 10:00.141
What's wrong?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.393
Your father just called.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.564
{\an3}Dylan, uh,
totaled his car.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.191
{\an3}He's in the hospital
on life support.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.652
Oh, my God.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.154
His vital signs are stable.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.864
He's breathing
without a respirator.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.699
And although
he's still unconscious,

10:16.782 --> 10:18.701
the good news is,
we rarely see

10:18.784 --> 10:21.203
a coma from a trauma
lasting more than 24 hours.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.081
{\an1}So, there's reason
to be optimistic, then?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.208
Well, I'm optimistic.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.002
{\an1}Is everything
all right, here?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.045
{\an3}JIM:
Yes,

10:29.128 --> 10:31.047
{\an1}we were just going over
the status

10:31.130 --> 10:32.673
{\an1}of Dylan McKay
with Dr. Young here.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.342
{\an1}Really?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.260
{\an3}Actually, I'm just
a med student,

10:36.344 --> 10:39.555
{\an3}but I was in the emergency
room when Dylan came in.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.015
Well, can we see him?

10:41.098 --> 10:43.559
Of course you can,
although visitors are only

10:43.642 --> 10:45.436
{\an3}allowed in two
at a time,

10:45.519 --> 10:48.689
{\an3}unless we can make an
exception just this once.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.069
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Forest, dial 112, please.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.781
Dr. Forest, please dial 112.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.242
(EKG monitor beeping
rhythmically)

11:01.994 --> 11:04.622
He can tell you're all
in the room.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.249
{\an1}Think so?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.542
I know so.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.297
(whooshing)

11:16.008 --> 11:18.219
Hi, you two. Come on in.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.721
(festive orchestral music
playing)

11:20.805 --> 11:23.099
{\an1}Oh, I told you
not to bring anything.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.267
You don't think I'd
come empty-handed?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.560
{\an1}You're terrible,
but we love you anyway.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.770
{\an3}Thank you.
(laughs)

11:27.853 --> 11:29.772
Mm. Happy Thanksgiving, Mom.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.232
Mm. Hi, Dylan.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.108
Mm. Where's Dad?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.609
{\an6}JIM:
Where do
you think?

11:33.692 --> 11:34.777
Hey-hey!

11:34.860 --> 11:36.112
{\an3}(chuckles)

11:36.195 --> 11:38.114
{\an3}I hope you brought
along your appetite.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.826
What, are you kidding me?
I've been fasting for two days.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.619
And guess who
else is here.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.829
Hmm?

11:45.871 --> 11:47.164
{\an6}KEVIN:
Hey, where
you been?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.332
{\an3}Our team's getting
clobbered here.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.625
Yeah? Which team is that?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.293
{\an6}SUZANNE:
Can I get you
a drink?

11:51.377 --> 11:52.753
Eh, maybe later.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.464
(TV sports announcer talking)

11:55.548 --> 11:57.633
{\an1}Oh, how you doing?
How was that conference?

11:57.716 --> 11:59.218
Very productive.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.804
{\an3}Our friend Monsieur Cousteau
sends his best regards.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.349
{\an4}(French accent):
Ah,<i> oui.</i> How is Jacques
these days, huh?

12:05.433 --> 12:06.809
(both chuckle)

12:06.892 --> 12:08.310
Cantankerous, as usual.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.980
{\an3}But very appreciative about
how our little company

12:11.063 --> 12:14.191
has helped to clean up the
oceans over the past few years.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.651
Well, as well he should be.

12:15.734 --> 12:16.652
(doorbell chimes)

12:16.735 --> 12:17.653
I'll get that.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.281
Oh, that's probably Erica.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.657
{\an1}What, you let
my little sister

12:21.740 --> 12:23.868
{\an1}walk over here all by
herself? Come on.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.036
{\an4}(chuckles):
What can I say?
She's a big girl.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.496
Yeah, she is.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.169
{\an1}You still hacking away
at that poor bird?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.004
You want to take over?

12:35.087 --> 12:38.549
(chuckles):
Yeah, just let me let Erica in.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.853
You didn't think
you were gonna get away from me

12:50.936 --> 12:52.313
that easily, did you?
(chuckling)

12:52.396 --> 12:53.689
(wind rushing)

12:58.611 --> 13:00.237
(echoing):
Dylan!

13:00.321 --> 13:01.614
(echoing):
Yeah?

13:02.740 --> 13:03.991
{\an1}Anyway, I was
gonna move the car.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.326
{\an6}Nah, it's okay.
I'll get it.
Yeah?

13:05.409 --> 13:06.368
Yeah.
Thanks, Dad.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.287
{\an3}Well, hey, what
are dads for, huh?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.042
Dad!

13:13.125 --> 13:15.044
Dad...!

13:18.088 --> 13:22.218
(yelling)

13:22.301 --> 13:24.595
(EKG monitor beeping
rhythmically)

13:29.475 --> 13:33.145
{\an6}(whispering):
I think it's time we should
leave him alone now.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.092
What time do you
have to be back?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.219
{\an1}Kickoff's in an hour,
although how I'm supposed

14:05.302 --> 14:06.929
{\an1}to play more flag football
today is beyond me.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.098
{\an3}Once you get in the
game, you'll be fine.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.266
Eh, maybe I shouldn't go.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.600
Brandon.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.727
It's not like
it's my fraternity.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.104
Don't do this to yourself.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.939
It's just so weird, Kel--
I mean...

14:17.022 --> 14:18.440
Josh died, what, six weeks ago?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.776
Now here we are again
back in the house of death.

14:20.859 --> 14:21.944
As long as Dylan

14:22.027 --> 14:23.654
is in there
fighting for his life,

14:23.737 --> 14:25.823
I don't think we should
be burying him just yet.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.576
You're right.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.619
{\an1}I'm gonna get some water--
you want something?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.204
No.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.503
How's he doing?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.755
{\an1}No change.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.966
Can he have any more visitors?

14:44.049 --> 14:45.884
I'll go check.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.680
So, what's it like

14:49.763 --> 14:50.764
in there?

14:52.391 --> 14:54.643
I've seen him twice now, and...

14:54.727 --> 14:58.063
both times I felt
he knew I was in there.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.316
He probably did.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.486
But in my case, I'm afraid I
might be making him feel worse.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.905
That sounds like something
Brenda would say.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.200
No, I'm serious.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.829
I mean, if anyone's
to blame here, it's... it's me.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.331
Wait just a second, Valerie.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.666
That Dylan is
lying in there in a coma

15:17.750 --> 15:19.668
is nobody's fault but his own.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.795
I mean, it's like Brandon
said on the way over here.

15:21.879 --> 15:24.798
I mean, we did everything
we could to try to help him.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.051
We did the intervention,
we found a great place

15:27.134 --> 15:29.720
for him to dry out--
and two minutes into his rehab,

15:29.803 --> 15:31.513
he's back out on the street?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.349
Whose fault is that?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.309
{\an3}I mean, it's not
like you knew

15:35.392 --> 15:37.227
he was out there on the street
getting wasted,

15:37.311 --> 15:39.563
and you didn't do anything
to try to stop him.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.691
Right.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.860
So don't let yourself
feel guilty.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.196
Sad, yes, but not guilty.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.699
Could I ask you a question?

15:50.783 --> 15:51.742
Sure.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.536
A personal question.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.829
Okay.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.375
You still love him, don't you?

16:01.960 --> 16:04.213
Are you ready?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.758
Yeah.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.054
(sighs)

16:12.137 --> 16:14.515
It's got to be
very tough on her.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.603
{\an1}We try to keep visits
to a minimum

16:19.687 --> 16:21.730
for the patient's own good.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.649
(sighs):
Okay.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.992
You bastard.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.208
(whooshing)

16:44.712 --> 16:46.755
(laughing)

16:48.048 --> 16:49.717
(laughs)

16:51.677 --> 16:52.928
I want you.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.972
I've always wanted you.

Dearly beloved,

17:41.101 --> 17:44.271
we are gathered here today...

17:44.354 --> 17:46.607
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

17:46.690 --> 17:47.816
It's a wedding.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.526
Actually, it's my wedding.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.153
Our wedding.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.030
I'm sorry, honey.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.326
I hate to be a stickler,
but you really shouldn't kiss

17:57.409 --> 17:59.286
until after
you've taken your vows.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.497
She's right, you know.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.664
{\an3}Absolutely.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.167
JIM:
And since you're the best man,

18:05.250 --> 18:07.669
I hope you remembered
to bring some wedding rings.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.172
VALERIE:
Don't worry, if he didn't...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.799
I did.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.136
(laughs)

18:26.105 --> 18:27.898
You can laugh at me

18:27.981 --> 18:29.274
all you want, Dylan.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.859
It's okay.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.071
I don't care...
as long as you marry me.

18:34.154 --> 18:34.947
Valerie...

18:35.030 --> 18:36.365
How many times
do I have to tell you

18:36.448 --> 18:37.157
I am not Valerie?!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.368
{\an1}(deep, distorted voice):
I am Brenda.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.204
That's who I am,
that's who I want to be.

18:42.287 --> 18:46.166
I want to be Brenda,
and I want to be your wife.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.710
I think we can get started.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.045
{\an3}Absolutely.

{\an5}ERICA:
Please, Dylan,
if you ever loved me,

18:56.677 --> 18:58.512
{\an3}if you ever were
my brother,

18:58.595 --> 19:02.015

What's your hurry, son?

{\an1}She's out there!
She's trapped!

She needs you, man.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.206
{\an1}You can do it,
you can do it. Be a hero.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.085
{\an1}Follow the light, the light,
just follow the light.

{\an3}KEVIN:
How you doing, kid?

{\an6}SUZANNE:
We've been so
worried about you.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.908
{\an6}KEVIN:
We thought you
were dead, man.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.368
{\an1}And I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart

20:03.452 --> 20:05.287
{\an1}that had I known that
stealing all your money

20:05.370 --> 20:07.122
{\an3}would've caused you
this much pain,

20:07.205 --> 20:09.124
{\an3}I never would've gone
through with it.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.461
{\an1}But... since
we've come this far,

20:12.544 --> 20:15.213
what choice do we have?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.633
Just business, kid.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.217
{\an3}You understand,
don't you?

20:20.969 --> 20:21.970
{\an3}How's his medication
coming, Doctor?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.222
He's gonna sleep like a baby.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.144
TEASLEY:
Don't worry, Dylan,

20:29.227 --> 20:30.729
you won't feel a thing.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.816
{\an3}Myles wants him to get
another three cc's of Narcan.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.611
Well, if that's what
Dr. Fox truly wants,

20:37.694 --> 20:40.322
{\an1}then he knows all he has to do
is write me up some paper.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.949
He's on a break.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.533
Well, then we're just
gonna have to wait.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.035
Well, he told me it was okay.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.328
{\an1}Jamie...

20:46.411 --> 20:48.789
this isn't going to work.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.629
He isn't doing so good, is he?

20:55.712 --> 20:57.464
He could be doing better.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.889
{\an1}Don't get me wrong,
I love him like a son,

21:05.973 --> 21:09.059
{\an1}but let's face it,
even if Dylan survives,

21:09.142 --> 21:11.019
{\an1}he's got a profound
drug problem,

21:11.103 --> 21:13.313
{\an1}and this ticker
can't take too much.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.691
{\an6}(sighs):
I'm with you
a thousand percent, Nat.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.901
You got to take care
of yourself--

21:17.985 --> 21:21.154
while you let me take care
of the Peach Pit After Dark.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.364
{\an3}Excuse me.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.617
{\an3}How can you be making business
deals at a time like this?

21:25.701 --> 21:28.662
{\an3}We're just going over
some contingencies, Andrea.

21:28.745 --> 21:29.663
(groans)

21:29.746 --> 21:32.207
Oh, uh, do I need permission
to have a life?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.835
Excuse me, Nat, if Jesse calls,
will you tell him

21:34.918 --> 21:37.713
I have to go to the hospital,
to see a friend?

21:37.796 --> 21:39.006
Will do, hon.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.924
Good-bye, Andrea.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.426
What's with her?

21:42.509 --> 21:43.301
Steve.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.555
{\an3}All we need are
some new investors.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.599
{\an3}Nat, once we take over
that rug store,

21:49.683 --> 21:51.309
{\an3}I'm gonna get
live acts in there,

21:51.393 --> 21:52.644
I'm gonna triple our business!

21:54.312 --> 21:55.772
{\an3}Why are you looking
at me like that?

21:55.856 --> 21:58.275
I don't like when you're
looking at me like that.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.402
{\an1}I love you like a son, too,
you know that, don't you?

22:00.485 --> 22:03.405
Well, if you love me, give me 48
hours to take over his shares.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.407
{\an3}And your shares, too, if
that's what it's gonna take.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.491
{\an3}Just don't cut me off
at the legs!

22:06.575 --> 22:09.411
It would be easier if we both
just walk away now.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.497
{\an3}Nat, since when have I done
anything the easy way?

22:14.958 --> 22:16.418
I just need 48 hours.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.919
12 hours.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.504
Nat.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.923
12 hours, and I'm out.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.383
Why are you putting
the screws to me?

22:23.467 --> 22:25.469
You know why, don't you?

22:28.513 --> 22:29.431
{\an1}Steve,

22:29.514 --> 22:31.808
you tell me where you're
going to get that money,

22:31.892 --> 22:33.060
and I'll leave you alone.

22:34.352 --> 22:37.105
Okay, If it comes down
to the 13th hour,

22:37.189 --> 22:39.274
and I'm feeling incredibly
masochistic,

22:39.357 --> 22:42.569
I'll, uh... I'll hit up
Rush for it.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.115
If I don't kill him
before halftime.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.035
Such is the fate
of fathers and sons, huh?

22:51.411 --> 22:52.662
{\an1}(chuckles)

22:52.746 --> 22:54.289
(EKG monitor beeping
rhythmically)

22:54.372 --> 22:56.166
(whooshing)

23:13.391 --> 23:15.435
(thunder crashing)

23:18.271 --> 23:19.439
(engine starts)

23:21.733 --> 23:23.026
{\an1}(sighs)

23:23.110 --> 23:26.822
{\an1}Well... (laughs) what did
you expect this to be--

23:26.905 --> 23:28.323
a walk in the woods?

23:28.406 --> 23:30.325
{\an3}Don't put me back
in that tunnel, man.

23:30.408 --> 23:33.286
Oh, who said anything
about a tunnel?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.996
I mean, you think
I want to watch you

23:35.080 --> 23:36.331
get trashed by a subway?

23:36.414 --> 23:39.126
Or watch them pull you
off your life support?

23:39.209 --> 23:40.293
(sighs)

23:40.377 --> 23:44.423
No, no. I got something
else in mind.

23:45.924 --> 23:49.928
(blues-rock riff playing)

23:51.513 --> 23:55.016
{\an6}TRILLING:
Any of these babes
look familiar to you?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.977
That one.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.311
I know that one.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.646
See that one over there?

23:59.729 --> 24:02.023
{\an1}DYLAN:
She's a twin.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.233
She's double join...

24:03.316 --> 24:04.776
I picked that one up
at Berkeley.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.944
{\an3}She, uh...

24:06.027 --> 24:08.363
must have been a good lover.

24:08.446 --> 24:09.698
Hey.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.491
Don't look at me like that.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.410
You've been with every face
in this room.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.162
Every face?

24:15.245 --> 24:18.373
{\an1}TRILLING:
Haven't you?

24:18.456 --> 24:19.457
Everyone?

24:21.626 --> 24:23.920
{\an1}DYLAN:
She had a jealous husband.

24:24.004 --> 24:28.884
{\an1}And that one...
she drove a blue van.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.010
(laughs giddily)

24:30.093 --> 24:31.887
I've been with everybody
in this room.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.388
(chuckling)

24:33.471 --> 24:35.348
Yeah.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.725
Uh-huh.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.061
{\an1}But I was your
favorite, wasn't I?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.688
Well, I don't know.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.276
(playing blues-rock riff)

24:46.359 --> 24:49.279
I was the best.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.992
Let's take a shower.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.546
Hi, Dylan.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.631
Hi.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.385
I can do anything you want.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.724
{\an1}Just let your
imagination wander.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.854
{\an1}You do have a good
imagination, don't you?

25:26.441 --> 25:27.651
Well...

25:28.902 --> 25:31.279
{\an3}Bet you didn't expect
to see me here.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.614
Well, actually, no.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.991
I think you're the only woman
in the room

25:35.075 --> 25:37.285
with whom I've never
had the pleasure.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.454
I've been saving it
all for you, Dylan.

25:39.537 --> 25:42.123
Well, we'll just have
to fix that, won't we?

25:51.549 --> 25:54.344
{\an3}So, you like the way
we're fixing it?

25:54.427 --> 25:56.137
Oh, yeah, I like getting fixed.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.599
Are you sure about that?

26:03.561 --> 26:06.690
I think he is.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.984
(whooshing)

26:09.067 --> 26:10.318
ERICA:
<i>Please, Dylan...</i>

26:10.402 --> 26:11.444
(train whistle blowing)

26:11.528 --> 26:12.821
<i>you're all I've got left.</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:13.989
<i>Help me.</i>

26:14.072 --> 26:17.117
(whooshing)
<i>Save me, please.</i>

26:17.200 --> 26:19.286
(whooshing)
<i>If you ever loved me,</i>

26:19.369 --> 26:21.162
(train brakes squealing)
<i>If you ever were my brother,</i>

26:21.246 --> 26:22.789
help me, save me.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.666
<i>Help...</i>

26:24.749 --> 26:26.042
(train approaching)

26:26.126 --> 26:27.127
Please.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.843
RUSH:
Okay, give it a try.

26:34.926 --> 26:35.844
We're ready?

26:35.927 --> 26:37.262
{\an3}Hut, hut,

26:37.345 --> 26:38.680
ho!

26:40.890 --> 26:42.809
Yeah.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.020
Ha!

26:46.104 --> 26:47.480
Nice shot, Rush.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.690
{\an1}RUSH:
Attaboy.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.733
Heck of a play, Rush.

26:49.816 --> 26:50.942
Yeah, well,
they take the fake,

26:51.026 --> 26:53.194
and if the pass gets there,
it's six points every time.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.738
Yeah, we should have
that in our playbook.

26:54.821 --> 26:55.697
Well... well, it would be
in your playbook

26:55.780 --> 26:57.866
if a certain quarterback
would take the time

26:57.949 --> 26:58.992
to make a playbook.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.827
{\an1}And here is that
"certain quarterback"

27:00.910 --> 27:03.371
{\an1}cutting it a little close--
my son, Stevie.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.206
{\an3}You know, why don't you
run the team, Dad?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.499
Oh, come on, Steve...
No, seriously.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.709
It's what you do best, really,

27:07.792 --> 27:10.045
other than bashing your son
and making a fool of yourself.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.755
Quite an accomplishment

27:11.838 --> 27:13.423
for a man your age.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.216
{\an3}I hope you're wearing
your orthodics.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.593
What is with him?

27:16.676 --> 27:18.094
Can't we have any fun
together anymore?

27:18.178 --> 27:19.763
I'll talk to him.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.098
Is this the KEG House or the
Nut House? What's going on?

27:22.182 --> 27:24.100
Steve, the way I see this is,

27:24.184 --> 27:26.561
we can forfeit the game and
drop out of the tournament,

27:26.644 --> 27:28.563
{\an1}or you can find some way
to start over with your dad.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.606
Yeah, well, forget that.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.775
{\an3}You know, for me to come here
in the state of mind

27:31.858 --> 27:33.735
{\an3}that I'm in, and have him
start a pissing contest

27:33.818 --> 27:35.028
{\an3}with me in front
of everybody--

27:35.111 --> 27:36.905
{\an3}but I'm sorry, that's
way out of line.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.073
He's just trying to
loosen everybody up.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.074
At my expense!

27:39.157 --> 27:40.075
You know, Steve...

27:40.158 --> 27:41.034
{\an3}It's always
at my expense.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.952
Are you siding with him?

27:43.036 --> 27:44.788
No, I'm siding with me
for a change.

27:44.871 --> 27:45.663
I'm not even in
your fraternity.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.540
I don't have to stick
around for this.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.541
Brandon...

27:48.625 --> 27:49.751
You know, Steve,

27:49.834 --> 27:50.752
years from now, this is not

27:50.835 --> 27:53.588
the golden college memory
I want to be having.

27:53.671 --> 27:55.799
You hassling with your dad;
Dylan, screwing his life up.

27:55.882 --> 27:56.925
It ain't right.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.385
Don't you think I know that?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.095
What's he doing now,

28:00.178 --> 28:01.596
shooting up?
I don't know.

28:01.679 --> 28:04.891
{\an4}BRANDON:
All I know is, he's
in intensive care,

28:04.974 --> 28:08.228
{\an1}When I got up this morning,
I was so pumped for this game.

28:08.311 --> 28:11.439
{\an3}So can't we pretend
it's still this morning?

28:11.523 --> 28:13.149
Can I pretend he's
not standing there?

28:13.233 --> 28:14.818
{\an4}BRANDON:
We can do whatever
we want, bro.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.069
{\an1}We're not doing this
for your father.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.862
We're not doing
this for Dylan.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.823
{\an3}Today is just about
you and me, all right?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.783
(sighs)

28:28.540 --> 28:29.749
BOTH:
The qua...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.793
the burrito...

28:31.876 --> 28:33.336
off-f-f-f...

28:43.471 --> 28:44.806
(whooshing)

28:44.889 --> 28:46.307
{\an6}KEVIN:
Go ahead, lady,
shoot him. Kill him!

28:46.391 --> 28:47.809
Just pull the trigger.
What's wrong with you?

28:47.892 --> 28:50.311
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me:

28:50.395 --> 28:52.605
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.524
I was just his vice principal
in high school.

28:54.607 --> 28:55.942
I didn't have anything
against Dylan.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.944
You're the people
who ripped him off

28:58.027 --> 28:59.863
and, and destroyed
his faith in mankind.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.114
Mrs. Teasley...

29:01.197 --> 29:02.699
(door opening,
receding footsteps)

29:02.782 --> 29:04.325
{\an1}I knew we couldn't
trust her.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.994
{\an3}What are we going
to do now?

29:06.077 --> 29:08.163
TRILLING:
Mm, not to worry,

29:08.246 --> 29:09.914
I'll pull the trigger.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.835
(gunshot)

29:13.918 --> 29:15.336
{\an5}ERICA:
<i>Dylan, you're all</i>
<i>I've got left.</i>

29:15.420 --> 29:17.464
<i>Help me.</i>

29:17.547 --> 29:19.340
MAN:
What's your hurry, son?

29:19.424 --> 29:22.302
Can't you spare something
for an old veteran, huh?

29:22.385 --> 29:23.470
Come on, man, don't stop!

29:23.553 --> 29:24.846
She needs help!

29:24.929 --> 29:26.848
She needs you, man! Be a hero!

29:26.931 --> 29:28.183
Follow the light!

29:28.266 --> 29:29.476
Follow the light!

29:29.559 --> 29:30.643
Come on, man.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.603
Follow the light!

29:31.686 --> 29:33.313
Yeah, what if I don't
"follow the light"?

29:33.396 --> 29:36.024
What? You have a choice
in the matter?

29:37.984 --> 29:38.902
Go to hell.

29:38.985 --> 29:39.861
Oh, what, hey,

29:39.944 --> 29:41.654
I've been there, man,

29:41.738 --> 29:44.032
{\an3}and it ain't that bad,
let me tell you.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.033
{\an3}Come on.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.201
(train whistle blowing)

29:46.284 --> 29:48.745
Save me, please.

29:49.787 --> 29:50.997
You're a hero, Mckay!

29:51.080 --> 29:55.877
Come on, You gotta have a couple
of bucks for an old altar boy.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.004
(train approaching)

30:01.007 --> 30:02.217
God bless you, son.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.260
I'll pray for your soul.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.057
(brakes hissing)

30:10.016 --> 30:11.935
So, what do you think?

30:12.018 --> 30:14.521
{\an1}This would be a great place
to shoot our next video.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.939
I don't know, I think

30:16.022 --> 30:18.066
{\an3}the Gin Blossoms
already shot one here.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.526
{\an1}So what?

30:19.609 --> 30:21.361
{\an1}Everything is
derivative, right?

30:21.444 --> 30:22.862
Yeah, I guess so.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.614
(water dripping)

30:24.697 --> 30:26.366
{\an1}(Clare's voice):
Hey, what's up, Dylan?

30:26.449 --> 30:27.534
{\an3}(David's voice):
David, he can't hear you.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.701
{\an3}(Clare's voice):
Well, maybe he can.

30:28.785 --> 30:32.372
{\an5}(David's voice):
Wrong. Look at him.
He's in a coma.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.249
{\an3}(Clare's voice):
You think he's going to die?

30:34.332 --> 30:35.917
(whooshing)

30:36.000 --> 30:38.086
{\an3}CLARE:
David, he can't hear you.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.255
Well, maybe he can.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.924
Wrong.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.884
{\an3}Look at him.
He's in a coma.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.096
{\an6}DAVID:
You think he's
going to die?

30:48.179 --> 30:49.681
(whooshing)

30:50.848 --> 30:53.101
When you're hot, you're hot.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.812
{\an1}SUZANNE:
Talk about being on a roll.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.772
He's having the game
of his life.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.107
He's just lucky.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.859
Lucky?

31:01.943 --> 31:02.944
Okay, maybe not lucky.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.737
{\an1}KEVIN:
That's right.

31:04.821 --> 31:05.863
He's good.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.494
He ain't good...

31:11.578 --> 31:12.787
he's great.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.497
You think so?

31:14.581 --> 31:16.666
Oh, believe me, man,

31:16.749 --> 31:18.876
{\an1}over the years, I've
seen them come and go.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.129
{\an1}You're the one they're
going to remember.

31:22.922 --> 31:25.800
Now all you gotta do
is make this shot.

31:25.883 --> 31:28.011
This little shot?

31:31.264 --> 31:33.891
No, this little shot.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.312
Relax, Dylan.
It'll all be over soon.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.938
It'll only hurt
for a few seconds,

31:39.022 --> 31:41.941
and then you'll never
feel anything again.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.776
(blues-rock riff playing)

31:43.860 --> 31:44.861
(breathing heavily)

31:54.829 --> 31:56.164
Just do it.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.832
He said yes.
He did?

31:57.915 --> 31:59.459
Just stick it in his arm,
get it over with.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.502
We're going as fast
as we can, babe.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.838
{\an3}If you share some of that with
me, I'll be your girlfriend.

32:03.921 --> 32:04.839
Get lost.

32:04.922 --> 32:05.840
{\an1}Please.

32:05.923 --> 32:07.050
Don't I know you?

32:07.133 --> 32:08.509
She's nothing, Dylan.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.053
She's just a strung-out
little street hustler.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.179
{\an1}Hurry up.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.348
He won't, he won't hold still.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.016
{\an3}TRILLING:
Just keep him with us.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.935
Hey, this is my turf.

32:18.019 --> 32:18.895
(yells)

32:18.978 --> 32:19.979
SUZANNE:
He is my meal ticket.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.481
Now take it somewhere else.

32:21.564 --> 32:23.900
{\an3}Who the hell are you?
His guardian angel?

32:23.983 --> 32:25.193
That's right.
I take care of him.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.861
I call the shots.
I keep him happy.

32:26.944 --> 32:29.614
I can make him happier.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.698
{\an4}SUZANNE:
If you wanted
to make it

32:30.782 --> 32:32.909
with some hot new babe,
all you had to do is ask.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.161
{\an3}Yeah, why don't you show him
who you had in mind, huh?

32:43.586 --> 32:45.129
No!

32:47.048 --> 32:48.383
Just do it!

32:48.466 --> 32:49.467
(Erica screaming)

32:49.550 --> 32:50.885
{\an3}DAVID:
What's wrong with him?

32:50.968 --> 32:51.886
I don't know.

32:51.969 --> 32:52.887
What the hell?

32:52.970 --> 32:53.971
Patient has become agitated

32:54.055 --> 32:55.390
for no apparent reason.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.891
{\an4}JAMIE:
Blood pressure
is rising to...

32:56.974 --> 32:58.059
{\an4}MYLES:
Prepare eight cc's
of Narcan, stat.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.352
{\an4}JAMIE:
Myles, what
are you doing?

32:59.435 --> 33:00.812
{\an4}MYLES:
I'm trying to save
this man's life.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.522
{\an3}Yeah. At that dosage, you'll
turn him into a vegetable.

33:02.605 --> 33:03.564
{\an5}Oh, my God.
MYLES:
Look I want you

33:03.648 --> 33:05.108
to get these kids
out of here now.

33:14.492 --> 33:17.537
(flatline tone humming)

33:47.442 --> 33:49.277
{\an3}Blue 55!

33:49.360 --> 33:51.028
Set. Go!

33:51.112 --> 33:52.447
{\an1}Go!

33:52.530 --> 33:54.574
{\an3}Go!

34:03.374 --> 34:08.295
(crowd cheering)

34:08.379 --> 34:09.922
RUSH:
First down!

34:10.005 --> 34:11.340
(cheering)

34:11.424 --> 34:12.467
(hearty chuckle)

34:12.550 --> 34:13.467
{\an1}Hey, Rush.

34:13.551 --> 34:14.969
Hey, Jimmy.
How are you?

34:15.052 --> 34:16.429
Doing pretty well.

34:16.512 --> 34:18.473
{\an1}What are you doing way
back here in the cheap seats?

34:18.556 --> 34:19.766
It's a little
nerve-racking

34:19.849 --> 34:20.933
for me to be down
on the sidelines,

34:21.016 --> 34:23.518
not to mention what
it does to my son.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.978
So what's the score?

34:25.062 --> 34:26.313
{\an3}Zero-zero,
40 seconds left.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.274
Ooh! Defensive slugfest.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.275
{\an3}Mm-hmm. The Zeebs drove
all the way down the field,

34:30.359 --> 34:32.152
{\an3}they had a first and goal
to go on the five,

34:32.235 --> 34:33.029
and we held them.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.156
{\an1}Wow! I would have
liked to have seen that.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.616
{\an3}Yeah? Well, you
shouldn't be working

34:36.699 --> 34:38.159
on a Saturday.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.328
Well, actually,
I was at the hospital.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.746
Nothing too serious, I hope.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.664
It is serious.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.833
Dylan McKay overdosed on drugs.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.002
Is he dead?

34:48.085 --> 34:51.130
No, no.
It doesn't look too good.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.509
I had no idea.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.011
Steve never mentioned
anything to me.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.305
Yeah. Makes you appreciate
what you've got.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.141
Yeah, it does.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.727
{\an1}STEVE:
All right, offense!

35:04.811 --> 35:07.063
Let's go! Way to go, guys.
Way to go. Way to go.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.190
All right, guys.
Phew!

35:09.273 --> 35:10.566
All right, bro,
40 seconds left.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.818
What do you
want to do?

35:11.901 --> 35:13.194
{\an3}We could always
run out the clock.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.362
{\an1}Give them the ball
this close to the end zone?

35:14.445 --> 35:15.363
Are you crazy?

35:15.446 --> 35:17.365
{\an3}(cheering)

35:17.448 --> 35:19.367
What about that play
my dad taught you guys?

35:19.450 --> 35:21.577
Flea flicker?

35:21.661 --> 35:24.163
Yeah.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.040
Let's do it.

35:26.123 --> 35:28.584
Okay, Brandon,
in the corner on two.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.169
Ready, yeah. (grunts)

35:30.253 --> 35:31.379
(whistle blows)

35:31.462 --> 35:33.464
(crowd cheering)

35:36.968 --> 35:37.969
Hut!

35:49.480 --> 35:50.606
(crowd cheering)

35:57.446 --> 35:58.865
(cheering)

36:19.010 --> 36:21.095
(monitor beeping erratically)

36:21.178 --> 36:22.680
I don't get it.

36:24.181 --> 36:26.392
He should have been
responding by now.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.312
{\an3}Just don't give him
another shot. Please.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.772
What is it with you
and this guy, huh?

36:31.856 --> 36:32.940
What, were you lovers

36:33.024 --> 36:35.067
{\an3}in another lifetime
or something?

36:35.151 --> 36:37.153
That's right, Myles. It
was in another lifetime,

36:37.236 --> 36:40.156
{\an3}only I was the doctor
and you were the cockroach.

36:40.239 --> 36:41.782
You're on report.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.326
{\an3}So are you!

36:44.994 --> 36:46.329
His blood pressure's 138.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.122
It was just 180.

36:48.205 --> 36:49.457
You want me
to page Dr. Whittaker?

36:49.540 --> 36:52.376
No. We'll just, um...

36:53.711 --> 36:56.172
I mean, medically,
scientifically,

36:56.255 --> 36:57.965
what we're seeing here,
it just, uh...

36:58.049 --> 36:59.926
it doesn't make any sense.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.345
Well, if you ask Jamie,
she says...

37:02.428 --> 37:07.808
she says what's going on
is a battle for the boy's soul.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.811
Who knows?

37:10.895 --> 37:13.022
Maybe she's right at this point.

37:14.774 --> 37:15.816
(whooshing)

37:34.293 --> 37:36.253
(thunder crashing)

37:39.257 --> 37:42.969
{\an5}ERICA:
Please, Dylan,
you're all I've got left.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.012
Help me.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.306
I need help. Please.

37:47.390 --> 37:52.186
Please, Dylan. Help.

37:52.269 --> 37:55.231
Please.

37:55.314 --> 37:56.691
Dylan, I need help.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.318
{\an6}MAN:
What's your
hurry, son?

37:59.402 --> 38:02.530
Can't you spare something
for an old veteran?

38:02.613 --> 38:05.032
Come on. You gotta have
a couple of bucks

38:05.116 --> 38:06.409
for an old altar boy.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.536
(train approaching)

38:11.831 --> 38:14.917
God Bless you, son.
I'll pray for your soul.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.213
I'll make you
a deal, okay?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.007
{\an3}Now, you go in there
and save Erica's life,

38:21.090 --> 38:22.216
{\an3}and I promise
I will never try

38:22.299 --> 38:24.635
{\an3}and shoot you up again.
Okay? All right.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.054
{\an1}How do I know
you're not lying?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.473
{\an3}You don't.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.268
Go to hell.

38:32.351 --> 38:35.563
Hey, you know, like I said,

38:35.646 --> 38:36.731
I've been there!

38:36.814 --> 38:38.357
It ain't so bad, Dylan!

38:38.441 --> 38:39.734
(train whistle blowing)

38:39.817 --> 38:43.195
{\an1}That's right!
You're a hero, McKay!

38:43.279 --> 38:46.073
Keep walking, chump.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.366
(monitor beeping,
whooshing)

38:47.450 --> 38:51.412
Please! Please, I need help.

38:51.495 --> 38:55.791
Dylan, please! Dylan, please.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.127
If you ever loved me,

38:58.210 --> 39:00.379
if you ever were my brother,

39:00.463 --> 39:02.715
please save me.

39:02.798 --> 39:04.425
(screaming)

39:07.178 --> 39:09.263
{\an1}I've been in there,
too, Dylan.

39:09.346 --> 39:13.225
{\an1}No matter what he tells you,
it's not worth it.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.852
Jack?

39:14.935 --> 39:19.356
{\an1}It's me,
the old altar boy.

39:23.027 --> 39:26.155
Dad, I tried.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.907
I did.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.451
I gave it everything I had.
I just don't got anymore.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.119
{\an3}Yes, you can, Dylan.
You really can.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.287
Now, you just
keep trying.

39:33.370 --> 39:36.123
There's a purpose to life.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.084
{\an1}Trust me.

39:41.712 --> 39:44.090
Trust yourself.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.966
{\an3}(panting)

40:00.022 --> 40:01.565
{\an3}JAMIE:
Bethany said you

40:01.649 --> 40:03.275
wanted to see me.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.319
I want to show
you something.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.991
{\an1}His breathing
is stable,

40:11.075 --> 40:13.786
{\an1}and his EKG
is back to normal.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.996
I can't believe it.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.289
{\an1}Well, he's
still unconscious

40:17.373 --> 40:21.293
{\an1}but, clearly,
he's out of the woods.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.588
What did you do?

40:25.714 --> 40:27.675
I did nothing.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.803
(EKG monitor beeping
rhythmically)

40:38.978 --> 40:41.522
All right, guys,
drinks are on me.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.691
{\an1}It's about time you
bought something, Muntz.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.026
{\an3}Actually, this
drink's on Sanders.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.528
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

40:47.611 --> 40:49.155
Seriously,
I'd like to make a toast.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.531
What, rye or sourdough?

40:50.614 --> 40:51.699
Oh, you know what?

40:51.782 --> 40:53.033
If that's the level
of humor

40:53.117 --> 40:54.368
that this fraternity
has sunken to,

40:54.451 --> 40:56.328
we are in deep poop.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.997
What I'd like to say is,

40:58.080 --> 41:00.541
now that we are in the finals
of Tournament 94...

41:00.624 --> 41:02.543
Yeah!
(all whooping)

41:02.626 --> 41:07.506
I'd like to acknowledge that the
greatest play that ever was...

41:07.590 --> 41:10.050
was a gift from Tournament 64.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.343
Thank you, Rush.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.054
(applause)
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!

41:14.138 --> 41:15.222
Am I hearing right?

41:15.306 --> 41:16.724
My son paid me
a compliment?

41:17.975 --> 41:18.726
(Rush laughs)

41:18.809 --> 41:20.561
Hey, win, lose or draw,
in my book,

41:20.644 --> 41:22.062
you guys are already champions.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.231
Well, just the same,
we'd better win next week.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.400
Otherwise,
he won't let me forget this.

41:26.483 --> 41:28.360
He's taken back
the compliment.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.905
Let <i> me</i> make a toast.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.365
RUSH:
Okay, to my son, the comedian.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.204
{\an3}To my son,
the quarterback.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.080
To my dad, the coach.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.081
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

41:41.165 --> 41:44.126
{\an1}To my dad,
the nightclub owner.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.920
The nightclub owner?

41:46.003 --> 41:48.214
Drink! We'll talk more.

41:48.297 --> 41:51.592
(group applauding,
whooping)

41:51.675 --> 41:53.052
Well, this could
be the beginning

41:53.135 --> 41:54.720
{\an3}of a whole new era
for those two.

41:54.803 --> 41:58.599
{\an1}At least until
intramural basketball starts.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.268
Want to get back
to the hospital?

42:01.352 --> 42:03.229
Yeah.

42:09.985 --> 42:13.447
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Coryn, dial 182, please.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.909
Dr. Coryn, please dial 182.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.091
(EKG monitor beeping
rhythmically)

42:34.885 --> 42:36.345
Dylan?

42:38.389 --> 42:41.016
Oh, Dylan...

42:41.100 --> 42:43.686
I knew you'd come back.

42:43.769 --> 42:47.147
Mom, is this real?

42:47.231 --> 42:50.067
It's very real.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.695
You're alive.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.626
{\an6}IRIS:
Excuse me. I was supposed
to notify the doctor

43:07.710 --> 43:09.378
{\an3}when my son
broke through.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.880
He's broken through.
